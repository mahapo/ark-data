00:00:01.087 --> 00:00:02.133
According to Mony Vital,

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.256
the vast majority of earth's population

3
00:00:04.256 --> 00:00:06.192
lives with an eye toward their death.

4
00:00:06.192 --> 00:00:08.117
He calls this the culture of death.

5
00:00:08.117 --> 00:00:09.876
This way of thinking did not resonate with

6
00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:11.690
Mony from an very early age,

7
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.994
when he rejected his parents' belief system

8
00:00:13.994 --> 00:00:16.035
as a child in Jerusalem.

9
00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:17.706
This set him free to think for himself,

10
00:00:17.706 --> 00:00:19.252
and his life has taken him down roads

11
00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:20.659
most of us only ponder,

12
00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:23.338
such as not eating food for 18 months.

13
00:00:23.338 --> 00:00:24.478
As a breatharian

14
00:00:24.478 --> 00:00:26.590
he experienced more vitality than ever before,

15
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.872
and dedicates his life to showing others

16
00:00:28.872 --> 00:00:30.878
how to live without the fear of death,

17
00:00:30.878 --> 00:00:32.335
the path to immortality.

(theme music)

19
00:00:46.256 --> 00:00:47.805
It's a pleassure to be here with you Mony,

20
00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:51.178
because this is a subject that is coming up everywhere.

21
00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:54.324
There are whole conferences dedicated...

22
00:00:54.324 --> 00:00:56.037
in fact, I think one just ended,

23
00:00:56.037 --> 00:00:58.590
dedicated to anti-aging.

24
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.910
And, even so, this still participates

25
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.195
in what you call the culture of death.

26
00:01:05.195 --> 00:01:06.103
<v ->Yes.</v>

27
00:01:06.103 --> 00:01:07.149
<v ->Ironically.</v>

28
00:01:08.373 --> 00:01:11.220
Talk about first what the culture of death is.

29
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.456
Define that for us.

30
00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:16.353
<v ->You know, it's funny that you mention this anti-aging.</v>

31
00:01:16.353 --> 00:01:18.065
It happened like a month ago, so...

32
00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:20.490
<v ->And there's another one just recently in Las Vegas.</v>

33
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.985
<v ->And you know, they don't talk about living.</v>

34
00:01:22.985 --> 00:01:24.679
They talk about death--

35
00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:25.650
<v ->And aging.</v>

36
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.374
<v ->About aging.</v>

37
00:01:27.374 --> 00:01:29.305
They don't even invite me,

38
00:01:29.305 --> 00:01:31.076
'cause I am far out.

39
00:01:31.076 --> 00:01:34.649
I am outside of the realm of death,

40
00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.272
so therefore, I am beyond anti-aging.

41
00:01:37.272 --> 00:01:38.695
I am not anti-aging.

42
00:01:38.695 --> 00:01:39.473
<v ->Yes.</v>

43
00:01:39.473 --> 00:01:40.546
<v ->See, I am about living.</v>

44
00:01:40.546 --> 00:01:41.291
<v ->Yes.</v>

45
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.140
<v ->And so, it's funny, I hard a hard time...</v>

46
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.745
Anyway, so....

47
00:01:47.715 --> 00:01:50.755
Yeah, we do, we live in the culture of death.

48
00:01:50.755 --> 00:01:52.450
It's the fact.

49
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.858
This culture that we live in,

50
00:01:53.858 --> 00:01:55.265
it's all about death.

51
00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:56.972
From A to Z.

52
00:01:56.972 --> 00:01:58.434
Your life insurance,

53
00:01:58.434 --> 00:02:00.385
every time you buy life insurance,

54
00:02:00.385 --> 00:02:03.911
and you sign the insurance certificate,

55
00:02:03.911 --> 00:02:06.248
you're signing your death certificate, practically.

56
00:02:06.248 --> 00:02:09.011
You're betting you will die faster

57
00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:12.190
than what the government think you should live.

58
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.018
<v ->Mmm-huh.</v>

59
00:02:13.618 --> 00:02:14.781
<v ->And that's an exchange.</v>

60
00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:16.060
So, the moment you sign it up,

61
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.437
you're already dead.

62
00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:19.794
You're already dead. Real dead.

63
00:02:19.794 --> 00:02:21.118
You're a walking zombie,

64
00:02:21.118 --> 00:02:23.567
and you're waiting for the day to drop.

65
00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:25.980
And, uh, so the culture,

66
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.633
it's based on this actuarial...

67
00:02:29.703 --> 00:02:30.362
<v ->Yes.</v>

68
00:02:30.362 --> 00:02:31.420
<v ->Numbers...</v>

69
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.464
And then you have religion.

70
00:02:33.464 --> 00:02:35.235
Religion is based on death.

71
00:02:35.235 --> 00:02:37.612
There is no religion without death.

72
00:02:37.612 --> 00:02:39.172
<v ->I read an article.</v>

73
00:02:39.172 --> 00:02:40.762
It was an interview with you on that topic,

74
00:02:40.762 --> 00:02:42.186
that I found fascinating,

75
00:02:42.186 --> 00:02:44.977
because you were taking it back into Biblical times,

76
00:02:44.977 --> 00:02:47.169
and giving this overview as a perspective

77
00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:49.809
of when you started bringing God and death together.

78
00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:51.195
Around the time of Abraham,

79
00:02:51.195 --> 00:02:53.349
and every religion foward.

80
00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.552
<v ->He brought the principles of God on one hand,</v>

81
00:02:57.552 --> 00:02:59.387
and death on the other hand.

82
00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:00.379
At that time,

83
00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:01.435
where he grew up,

84
00:03:01.435 --> 00:03:02.533
and he lived,

85
00:03:02.533 --> 00:03:03.877
death wasn't an issue.

86
00:03:03.877 --> 00:03:05.093
Nobody dies.

87
00:03:05.093 --> 00:03:06.819
People live hundreds of years.

88
00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.517
<v ->Yes, that's in the book of references,</v>

89
00:03:08.517 --> 00:03:10.166
they lived five, six, seven hundred years.

90
00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:10.854
<v ->Yes, they lived hundred of years!</v>

91
00:03:10.854 --> 00:03:13.524
<v ->Yeah, he himself lived hundreds of years.</v>

92
00:03:13.524 --> 00:03:16.712
Everybody before him lived many, many years,

93
00:03:16.712 --> 00:03:19.995
Now, so, God was their friend.

94
00:03:19.995 --> 00:03:22.738
God was not anything but...

95
00:03:24.372 --> 00:03:27.237
an astronaut that come to visit.

96
00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:29.298
And they called them gods.

97
00:03:29.298 --> 00:03:30.867
They didn't give 'em one god.

98
00:03:30.867 --> 00:03:32.775
There was no one god. The gods.

99
00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:35.538
In Hebrew, god, is Elohim

100
00:03:35.538 --> 00:03:36.925
meaning many gods.

101
00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:37.947
<v ->Mmm-huh.</v>

102
00:03:37.947 --> 00:03:41.169
<v ->Yeah, but then they change that word to mean one.</v>

103
00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.058
Even though it's plural.

104
00:03:43.058 --> 00:03:47.508
So, all organzied religion based on these two prinicples:

105
00:03:48.348 --> 00:03:50.656
death and god.

106
00:03:50.656 --> 00:03:52.390
Death is the whip.

107
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.219
God is the carrot.

108
00:03:54.523 --> 00:03:57.062
And they scare you with death, and sickness, and disease

109
00:03:57.062 --> 00:03:57.937
and all this other.

110
00:03:57.937 --> 00:03:59.575
You want their business,

111
00:03:59.575 --> 00:04:00.603
and they become a middle-man

112
00:04:00.603 --> 00:04:02.181
between you and your own god.

113
00:04:02.181 --> 00:04:04.080
Which god just lives inside you.

114
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.623
<v ->Yes!</v>

115
00:04:04.623 --> 00:04:06.171
<v ->You are the god!</v>

116
00:04:06.171 --> 00:04:06.960
<v ->Yes!</v>

117
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.631
<v ->It's so funny!</v>

118
00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:08.442
<v ->It is funny.</v>

119
00:04:08.442 --> 00:04:11.813
<v ->And, you know, all Christianity is part of Judaism.</v>

120
00:04:11.813 --> 00:04:15.233
And they're all exact same principles.

121
00:04:15.823 --> 00:04:17.358
Death and god.

122
00:04:17.358 --> 00:04:19.396
And then the Muslim do the same thing!

123
00:04:19.396 --> 00:04:21.850
Everybody copy from everybody else.

124
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.228
He was an amazing, brilliant person, this Abraham.

125
00:04:26.564 --> 00:04:30.751
Because of him, humanity start dying below 100.

126
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.152
Even his children lived below 100.

127
00:04:34.936 --> 00:04:36.264
His own kids!

128
00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:38.329
Believed him!

129
00:04:38.329 --> 00:04:40.811
Yeah, and they end up dead below 100.

130
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:42.617
Yeah. And since then...

131
00:04:42.617 --> 00:04:45.309
100 is the highest,

132
00:04:46.382 --> 00:04:47.986
and even in Judaism,

133
00:04:47.986 --> 00:04:50.771
when somebody wanna to wish you good luck...

134
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:53.497
at your birthday, they say, hey, live 'til 120.

135
00:04:53.497 --> 00:04:54.146
You know?

136
00:04:54.146 --> 00:04:55.203
It's a curse.

137
00:04:55.543 --> 00:04:57.560
Why they want somebody to die at 120?

138
00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.895
And actually live to 120,

139
00:04:59.895 --> 00:05:02.868
but basically telling you, hey, this is the limit.

140
00:05:03.195 --> 00:05:04.458
<v ->Don't go over it, you know.</v>

141
00:05:04.458 --> 00:05:05.252
<v ->Right.</v>

142
00:05:05.252 --> 00:05:06.382
In fact, you...

143
00:05:06.382 --> 00:05:07.577
I'm gonna quote from you,

144
00:05:07.577 --> 00:05:08.897
out of this article, 'cause I loved it.

145
00:05:08.897 --> 00:05:11.166
You said, "This system is very efficient.

146
00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:12.990
It's the most productive marketing tool

147
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.857
ever created in human history.

148
00:05:14.857 --> 00:05:17.431
There's been no adjustment needed from the time

149
00:05:17.431 --> 00:05:19.010
of Abraham until today.

150
00:05:19.144 --> 00:05:19.928
<v ->That's right.</v>

151
00:05:20.104 --> 00:05:22.418
<v ->"In this culture, the culture of the creation of death."</v>

152
00:05:22.418 --> 00:05:23.428
<v ->That's right.</v>

153
00:05:23.428 --> 00:05:25.602
Every religion, every cult.

154
00:05:25.715 --> 00:05:27.336
Based on those two things:

155
00:05:27.336 --> 00:05:29.334
death and god.

156
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.157
You know, they want you to fear god,

157
00:05:32.157 --> 00:05:33.343
and then you pay money,

158
00:05:33.343 --> 00:05:35.142
you pay 10%, 20% of your money

159
00:05:35.142 --> 00:05:37.158
to the organization.

160
00:05:37.158 --> 00:05:39.744
Ant they they middle-man between you and your god.

161
00:05:40.188 --> 00:05:40.980
<v ->Yes.</v>

162
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.258
<v ->And they make that money.</v>

163
00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:43.378
They want it.

164
00:05:43.378 --> 00:05:46.246
You know, the more you believe in god,

165
00:05:46.246 --> 00:05:49.380
that he supposedly control you...

166
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.398
and then he control your life and death.

167
00:05:53.398 --> 00:05:54.241
<v ->Mmm-huh.</v>

168
00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:54.794
<v ->You know?</v>

169
00:05:54.794 --> 00:05:58.100
The reality is that you are the boss.

170
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.914
But, the moment you believe in death,

171
00:05:59.914 --> 00:06:01.961
then you're already dead,

172
00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:04.779
because the orders your subconscious

173
00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:07.440
function only from what you believe in.

174
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.051
<v ->Yes, and then you take it</v>

175
00:06:10.051 --> 00:06:11.581
into the medical industry as well,

176
00:06:11.581 --> 00:06:13.469
which is an industry which helps us

177
00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:15.538
avoid death for a little longer.

178
00:06:15.538 --> 00:06:16.722
<v ->Right. Right.</v>

179
00:06:16.722 --> 00:06:18.481
The medical industry...

180
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:22.992
doesn't even do that.

181
00:06:22.992 --> 00:06:26.963
The medical industry is suppress your pain and feeling.

182
00:06:26.963 --> 00:06:28.574
<v ->That's true. That is true.</v>

183
00:06:28.574 --> 00:06:30.121
<v ->Yeah, that's basically what it does.</v>

184
00:06:30.121 --> 00:06:31.736
<v ->Unless it's trauma where you have to be</v>

185
00:06:31.736 --> 00:06:33.024
stitched up or you'll bleed to death.

186
00:06:33.024 --> 00:06:34.373
<v ->Right. Right.</v>

187
00:06:34.373 --> 00:06:35.058
<v ->The rest of it is all--</v>

188
00:06:35.058 --> 00:06:36.659
<v ->For accident, it's the perfect...</v>

189
00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:37.728
We want them.

190
00:06:37.728 --> 00:06:39.219
We want them to be the best.

191
00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:43.176
But for diseases and development and aging,

192
00:06:43.176 --> 00:06:45.619
and this whole process of dying...

193
00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:48.136
You see, the culture call it:

194
00:06:48.136 --> 00:06:49.341
Oh, he is aging.

195
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:51.043
He is aging nicely.

196
00:06:51.337 --> 00:06:53.628
There is no such a thing. He is dying.

197
00:06:53.628 --> 00:06:56.349
It's just another word to make you feel good

198
00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:58.003
when you age and die.

199
00:06:58.003 --> 00:07:00.837
You know, all disease is a function,

200
00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.642
and it's outcome of death.

201
00:07:03.982 --> 00:07:07.207
If you take the death beliefs out of your system,

202
00:07:07.207 --> 00:07:09.818
out of your body, out of your cells.

203
00:07:10.108 --> 00:07:12.531
Then, there's no more aging.

204
00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:14.759
You cannot be sick.

205
00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:18.127
Your body cannot allow you to be sick for one day.

206
00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.918
If you get a cold, the cold will be for 30 seconds.

207
00:07:22.918 --> 00:07:24.363
It's a thought.

208
00:07:24.363 --> 00:07:27.127
It's nothing more than is that.

209
00:07:28.027 --> 00:07:29.649
It's not a physical thing.

210
00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:32.226
It could be, if you part of dying.

211
00:07:32.966 --> 00:07:35.805
If you are a dying species, you know?

212
00:07:35.805 --> 00:07:39.151
And remember: if somebody is dying, he has no future.

213
00:07:39.151 --> 00:07:40.109
<v ->Mmm-huh.</v>

214
00:07:40.109 --> 00:07:42.196
<v ->Because they know they're gonna die.</v>

215
00:07:42.196 --> 00:07:44.423
A person is 50 or 60...

216
00:07:44.423 --> 00:07:45.242
when I ask them:

217
00:07:45.242 --> 00:07:47.340
What are you goinna do 20 years from now?

218
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.422
The first thought: he's in the grave.

219
00:07:49.422 --> 00:07:50.029
<v ->No.</v>

220
00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:51.202
People still think like that?

221
00:07:51.202 --> 00:07:52.504
<v ->Of course. They're dead.</v>

222
00:07:52.504 --> 00:07:53.709
They know they're dead.

223
00:07:53.709 --> 00:07:54.617
They're planning.

224
00:07:54.617 --> 00:07:57.368
Listen, they write their will.

225
00:07:57.368 --> 00:08:00.204
They get their "paperly" you know, intact.

226
00:08:00.524 --> 00:08:02.061
<v ->That's true, you get your paperwork intact.</v>

227
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:03.440
Everybody forcing you.

228
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.260
Listen to the commercials every day.

229
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.148
Everybody want you to go and sign up

230
00:08:07.148 --> 00:08:08.545
and do all these right things for you.

231
00:08:08.545 --> 00:08:09.825
<v ->Yes, you're right. Yeah.</v>

232
00:08:09.825 --> 00:08:10.881
<v ->So they're already dead.</v>

233
00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:12.295
They already think they have no future,

234
00:08:12.295 --> 00:08:14.101
so a man at 50...

235
00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:16.566
Well, what kind of future can he develop?

236
00:08:16.566 --> 00:08:20.398
What possibly can he look forward when he's 70?

237
00:08:20.398 --> 00:08:21.288
Nothing!

238
00:08:21.288 --> 00:08:23.038
'Specially living in this culture.

239
00:08:23.038 --> 00:08:24.829
What kind of retirement is that?

240
00:08:24.829 --> 00:08:26.589
Who are you, you know?

241
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:30.162
So, I came and I want to change that paradigm.

242
00:08:31.432 --> 00:08:33.384
You have no business dying.

243
00:08:33.384 --> 00:08:35.858
There is no reason for you to die.

244
00:08:35.858 --> 00:08:38.397
So, change your belief and start living.

245
00:08:38.397 --> 00:08:40.820
Become an alive being!

246
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.573
<v ->Yes!</v>

247
00:08:42.243 --> 00:08:43.972
<v ->Every day you're alive.</v>

248
00:08:44.702 --> 00:08:48.521
The other way, every day, you're dying more.

249
00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:51.489
<v ->And going on what you just said a moment ago</v>

250
00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:53.257
about people filling out their wills

251
00:08:53.257 --> 00:08:55.796
and insurance policies and everything else,

252
00:08:55.796 --> 00:08:56.948
we interviewed a fellow named

253
00:08:56.948 --> 00:08:58.901
Russell Targ, who's a physicist,

254
00:08:58.901 --> 00:09:00.018
Dr. Russel Targ,

255
00:09:00.018 --> 00:09:02.014
and he wrote a book called End of Suffering,

256
00:09:02.014 --> 00:09:04.659
and what he noticed in his observation in his world,

257
00:09:04.659 --> 00:09:07.215
which was kind of a elite world of physics and science,

258
00:09:07.215 --> 00:09:10.175
and high-profile companies like Lockheed,

259
00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:13.954
is that the human resources department...

260
00:09:17.464 --> 00:09:20.954
had to analyze, their actuaries analyze....

261
00:09:21.804 --> 00:09:22.973
when...

262
00:09:22.973 --> 00:09:25.165
how long each person lives after death,

263
00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:27.637
and they kind of back-engineer your payout,

264
00:09:27.637 --> 00:09:28.628
and your retirement.

265
00:09:28.628 --> 00:09:30.522
I don't know quite how those things work

266
00:09:30.522 --> 00:09:31.228
'cause I don't have any of those,

267
00:09:31.228 --> 00:09:34.716
but what they found was the average person there

268
00:09:34.716 --> 00:09:38.298
was dying within a couple of years of retirement,

269
00:09:38.298 --> 00:09:41.798
very frequently because they didn't have a purpose anymore.

270
00:09:41.798 --> 00:09:43.322
They lost their identity.

271
00:09:43.322 --> 00:09:45.744
So, you're saying we have to create

272
00:09:45.744 --> 00:09:49.252
a much more essential identity for ourselves.

273
00:09:49.252 --> 00:09:50.713
<v ->Right. Life purpose.</v>

274
00:09:50.713 --> 00:09:52.035
This is the key.

275
00:09:52.035 --> 00:09:53.902
If you're not gonna live,

276
00:09:53.902 --> 00:09:55.465
there is no life purpose.

277
00:09:56.105 --> 00:09:59.309
If you have no life force, that's another issue.

278
00:09:59.309 --> 00:10:01.367
See, life force...

279
00:10:02.407 --> 00:10:03.633
We live in a culture

280
00:10:03.633 --> 00:10:06.081
that does not promote life force.

281
00:10:06.081 --> 00:10:08.310
The average life force in this country,

282
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:10.241
from zero to a hundred, is 53.

283
00:10:10.741 --> 00:10:12.236
It should be 80.

284
00:10:12.236 --> 00:10:15.252
For any functional human being.

285
00:10:16.662 --> 00:10:18.894
And then you build on it, you know?

286
00:10:18.894 --> 00:10:21.858
So, everybody is sick and in misery and pain.

287
00:10:21.858 --> 00:10:23.048
You know?

288
00:10:23.048 --> 00:10:24.760
And that's become the norm.

289
00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.590
And that's the only conversation there is between people.

290
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:27.218
<v ->Yeah.</v>

291
00:10:27.218 --> 00:10:29.046
<v ->I mean, you know...</v>

292
00:10:29.046 --> 00:10:31.149
You see your family and at dinner,

293
00:10:31.149 --> 00:10:32.445
what do they ask you?

294
00:10:32.445 --> 00:10:33.673
Who's your doctor?

295
00:10:33.673 --> 00:10:34.889
What did you do?

296
00:10:34.889 --> 00:10:37.090
How many pills do you take a day?

297
00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.110
These are the questions.

298
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.883
This is the conversation that's going on in life.

299
00:10:40.883 --> 00:10:42.583
In our culture.

300
00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:45.990
It's not something normal, I think.

301
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.713
I know my mom thinks that way,

302
00:10:48.713 --> 00:10:51.255
but she doesn't wanna change.

303
00:10:51.255 --> 00:10:52.758
That's fine, you know?

304
00:10:52.758 --> 00:10:53.393
<v ->Right.</v>

305
00:10:53.393 --> 00:10:54.856
<v ->This is not for everybody.</v>

306
00:10:54.856 --> 00:10:56.351
This conversation is for the people

307
00:10:56.351 --> 00:10:58.185
who really wants to live.

308
00:10:58.185 --> 00:11:01.674
They need to know that there is an option to the death.

309
00:11:01.944 --> 00:11:03.814
There is an option to the disease.

310
00:11:03.814 --> 00:11:05.900
There's an option to...

311
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.023
resentment, and fear, and victimization.

312
00:11:10.046 --> 00:11:12.477
You know, we are....

313
00:11:13.769 --> 00:11:15.352
our own victims.

314
00:11:15.571 --> 00:11:16.809
If we live in this culture,

315
00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:18.077
and we accept what the culture

316
00:11:18.077 --> 00:11:20.392
teach us and sell us,

317
00:11:20.392 --> 00:11:24.413
so we are just normal people dying every day,

318
00:11:24.413 --> 00:11:25.757
normal death,

319
00:11:25.757 --> 00:11:27.080
and it's okay,

320
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.362
because that's the way of the world,

321
00:11:29.362 --> 00:11:31.410
because you have to pay taxes and die,

322
00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.767
the two sure things in life.

323
00:11:33.767 --> 00:11:36.167
And that doesn't work, you know?

324
00:11:36.167 --> 00:11:37.560
It didn't work for me.

325
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.280
<v ->Right.</v>

326
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.757
<v ->And you know, I'm doing well, you know,</v>

327
00:11:41.757 --> 00:11:43.719
I'm happy and....

328
00:11:43.719 --> 00:11:46.994
<v ->You started this journey really young, like five.</v>

329
00:11:46.994 --> 00:11:47.783
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

330
00:11:47.783 --> 00:11:50.653
<v ->You were questioning things at a very early age,</v>

331
00:11:50.653 --> 00:11:52.603
and somewhere along the line,

332
00:11:52.603 --> 00:11:54.780
you came up with the understanding:

333
00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.116
you were the boss of your life,

334
00:11:57.116 --> 00:11:58.979
of your health, of your vitality.

335
00:11:58.979 --> 00:11:59.707
<v ->Right.</v>

336
00:12:00.027 --> 00:12:01.670
<v ->How did that come through to you,</v>

337
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:04.679
and what did you first do with that information?

338
00:12:04.679 --> 00:12:06.941
<v ->Well, I had a conversation with my dad, he want...</v>

339
00:12:06.941 --> 00:12:09.788
You know, I grew up in Jerusalem,

340
00:12:09.788 --> 00:12:12.338
and on a Saturday one time,

341
00:12:12.338 --> 00:12:13.598
we walk into the synagogue,

342
00:12:13.598 --> 00:12:15.099
which I don't go normally,

343
00:12:15.099 --> 00:12:16.720
but I went with him that time,

344
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.270
and, on the way, he asked me if I believe in God.

345
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.523
And I said, "I don't know. I haven't met him yet.'

346
00:12:23.963 --> 00:12:25.167
And a little kid, you know?

347
00:12:25.167 --> 00:12:26.603
And he looked at me like he was

348
00:12:26.603 --> 00:12:28.033
shocked that I would say that.

349
00:12:28.543 --> 00:12:32.013
And then, he twisted my ear so hard and so long,

350
00:12:32.013 --> 00:12:33.956
that the moment he let go,

351
00:12:33.956 --> 00:12:36.433
I ran away for a couple-a days.

352
00:12:37.113 --> 00:12:39.042
And then I realize that...

353
00:12:40.368 --> 00:12:41.774
I need to obey,

354
00:12:41.774 --> 00:12:44.239
and I need to believe certain way to be okay.

355
00:12:44.239 --> 00:12:45.742
<v ->To be part of the family and accepted.</v>

356
00:12:45.742 --> 00:12:46.749
<v ->To be part. Yeah.</v>

357
00:12:46.749 --> 00:12:48.904
And I wasn't ready for it.

358
00:12:49.309 --> 00:12:51.733
<v ->And then and then I decided that it's not for me.</v>

359
00:12:51.733 --> 00:12:53.972
I'm gonna find out what's going on.

360
00:12:53.972 --> 00:12:58.393
Who's who and why should I do that and since then...

361
00:12:58.393 --> 00:13:00.078
<v ->That's a very brave thing to do,</v>

362
00:13:00.078 --> 00:13:03.572
because you're steeped in a culture that is very deep.

363
00:13:03.582 --> 00:13:06.653
<v ->He didn't talk to me for two years.</v>

364
00:13:06.653 --> 00:13:08.242
From five to seven.

365
00:13:08.242 --> 00:13:09.916
He never said hello to me again.

366
00:13:09.916 --> 00:13:10.738
<v ->Oh.</v>

367
00:13:10.738 --> 00:13:13.237
<v ->Yeah, that was big punishment for a little kid.</v>

368
00:13:13.237 --> 00:13:14.112
<v ->Oh, yeah.</v>

369
00:13:14.112 --> 00:13:15.026
<v ->But, he was stubborn.</v>

370
00:13:15.026 --> 00:13:16.091
And I was stubborn, too.

371
00:13:16.699 --> 00:13:18.853
<v ->And then I went the other way, you know?</v>

372
00:13:18.853 --> 00:13:20.518
We become friend later on, but...

373
00:13:20.518 --> 00:13:21.232
<v ->Mmm-huh.</v>

374
00:13:21.232 --> 00:13:23.920
So you realize I'm the boss of my reality

375
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.010
at a very young age.

376
00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:25.998
<v ->Right.</v>

377
00:13:25.998 --> 00:13:27.408
<v ->So, how did this start playing out in your life</v>

378
00:13:27.408 --> 00:13:28.859
in terms of this journey of understanding

379
00:13:28.859 --> 00:13:30.950
about the culture of death,

380
00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.910
immortality, and so forth?

381
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:37.831
<v ->Well, you need to know that if you don't make choices...</v>

382
00:13:38.821 --> 00:13:40.869
somebody else gonna make them for you.

383
00:13:40.869 --> 00:13:41.596
<v ->Yes.</v>

384
00:13:41.596 --> 00:13:44.081
<v ->See, one thing I learned, it's:</v>

385
00:13:44.081 --> 00:13:46.778
everything is on a default mode.

386
00:13:46.778 --> 00:13:49.417
This culture is based on...

387
00:13:50.106 --> 00:13:53.120
if you don't take action, don't worry.

388
00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.805
Something else will happen,

389
00:13:54.805 --> 00:13:57.364
and you're gonna be fine at the end of the day.

390
00:13:57.364 --> 00:13:58.581
And that's a default.

391
00:13:58.581 --> 00:14:00.862
And the default here is death.

392
00:14:00.862 --> 00:14:02.035
As long as you die,

393
00:14:02.035 --> 00:14:04.842
you're gonna be accepted.

394
00:14:04.842 --> 00:14:07.017
The church will accept you.

395
00:14:07.369 --> 00:14:09.736
<v ->Everybody will accept you as long as you dying.</v>

396
00:14:11.346 --> 00:14:14.910
And if you're living, then it's choice.

397
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:18.516
And then a whole new world open up for you,

398
00:14:18.516 --> 00:14:21.619
and many people don't wanna be even your friend

399
00:14:21.619 --> 00:14:23.690
because you have nothing in common.

400
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.848
You become a scary person because you wanna live.

401
00:14:27.208 --> 00:14:27.849
<v ->I understand that,</v>

402
00:14:27.849 --> 00:14:29.566
because some people are so oriented

403
00:14:29.566 --> 00:14:31.443
toward walking through the program

404
00:14:31.443 --> 00:14:33.757
and then going into their grave,

405
00:14:33.757 --> 00:14:37.597
that as I read in one of the articles about you,

406
00:14:37.597 --> 00:14:39.940
you said people, given the choice,

407
00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.070
most of them would say:

408
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:42.606
I don't want to live.

409
00:14:42.606 --> 00:14:44.461
I don't wanna live a long life.

410
00:14:44.461 --> 00:14:46.540
For what? It's too painful.

411
00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:47.799
<v ->Yeah, they don't know.</v>

412
00:14:47.799 --> 00:14:48.780
<v ->And that's a statement.</v>

413
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.827
And I'm sure many people are listening...

414
00:14:50.827 --> 00:14:52.406
some of our viewers, wonderful viewers,

415
00:14:52.406 --> 00:14:53.572
have probably felt,

416
00:14:53.572 --> 00:14:55.263
I don't want to live to be a hundred, what for?

417
00:14:55.263 --> 00:14:56.260
For this?

418
00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.832
<v ->'Cause they don't know the options.</v>

419
00:14:57.832 --> 00:14:58.625
<v ->Right.</v>

420
00:14:58.625 --> 00:14:59.407
<v ->They have no clue.</v>

421
00:14:59.407 --> 00:15:00.958
Nobody told them.

422
00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.020
<v ->You see, when we go to school,</v>

423
00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.373
and, you know, I study psychology,

424
00:15:04.373 --> 00:15:06.483
and they teach you what is,

425
00:15:06.483 --> 00:15:08.031
how the world behaves,

426
00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:09.311
and if they behave differently,

427
00:15:09.311 --> 00:15:10.515
then something wrong with them,

428
00:15:10.515 --> 00:15:11.956
and there's a name for it.

429
00:15:13.087 --> 00:15:14.654
So they teach you what is, basically.

430
00:15:14.654 --> 00:15:16.873
And then, you know, when I finished school,

431
00:15:16.873 --> 00:15:18.292
I got my PhD, and I'm asking myself,

432
00:15:20.162 --> 00:15:21.657
What did I learn?

433
00:15:22.237 --> 00:15:23.708
I learned nothing.

434
00:15:23.708 --> 00:15:26.558
I figured out that if I wanted to know

435
00:15:26.558 --> 00:15:28.606
what they forgot telling me.

436
00:15:28.606 --> 00:15:29.096
<v ->Yes!</v>

437
00:15:29.096 --> 00:15:32.103
<v ->What is it that it's not real.</v>

438
00:15:32.843 --> 00:15:34.401
I mean, what is?

439
00:15:34.867 --> 00:15:37.192
This, they think they know what is,

440
00:15:37.192 --> 00:15:39.434
but I was looking for what isn't.

441
00:15:39.434 --> 00:15:40.413
<v ->Mmm-huh.</v>

442
00:15:40.413 --> 00:15:43.761
<v ->In this whole, complex life.</v>

443
00:15:43.761 --> 00:15:47.079
And I realize it's all based on one thing:

444
00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:49.234
death, death, and death.

445
00:15:49.234 --> 00:15:51.122
If you gonna be alive,

446
00:15:51.122 --> 00:15:52.241
you know, but for me,

447
00:15:52.241 --> 00:15:54.437
you're gonna be outside of the box,

448
00:15:54.437 --> 00:15:55.291
thinking outside the box,

449
00:15:55.291 --> 00:15:56.347
living outside the box,

450
00:15:56.347 --> 00:15:58.555
and you know, to be healthy,

451
00:15:58.555 --> 00:16:00.950
and live long life, it's perfect.

452
00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:02.374
You don't have to spend money.

453
00:16:02.374 --> 00:16:04.099
There's no doctor bills.

454
00:16:04.099 --> 00:16:06.787
You don't have to have insurance. Ever.

455
00:16:07.227 --> 00:16:10.382
Uh, there's no lawyers involved anymore.

456
00:16:10.382 --> 00:16:11.845
<v ->Very true!</v>

457
00:16:12.725 --> 00:16:14.468
<v ->Life is simple.</v>

458
00:16:14.468 --> 00:16:18.576
And, you know, like, I went far out,

459
00:16:18.576 --> 00:16:21.269
and at some point I did not eat for a year -and-a-half.

460
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:22.628
I was a breatharian.

461
00:16:22.628 --> 00:16:24.916
So, I didn't have, I didn't need money.

462
00:16:24.916 --> 00:16:26.707
I live home without money.

463
00:16:26.707 --> 00:16:29.053
<v ->And I wanna talk to you about that a little more</v>

464
00:16:29.053 --> 00:16:30.942
after you finish this thought.

465
00:16:30.942 --> 00:16:34.280
<v ->Yeah, so, but there are options,</v>

466
00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.671
and people need to know that we need to find,

467
00:16:37.671 --> 00:16:38.973
what's the other way,

468
00:16:38.973 --> 00:16:42.044
what are the options available to us as being,

469
00:16:42.044 --> 00:16:43.755
as human being, you know?

470
00:16:43.771 --> 00:16:47.155
So listen, even if you don't have the option...

471
00:16:47.155 --> 00:16:48.721
make a choice.

472
00:16:49.371 --> 00:16:50.971
At least if you're gonna die,

473
00:16:50.971 --> 00:16:52.333
die by choice,

474
00:16:52.333 --> 00:16:53.947
not on a default mode.

475
00:16:54.157 --> 00:16:55.035
<v ->Yes.</v>

476
00:16:55.233 --> 00:16:56.556
<v ->And if you read my book,</v>

477
00:16:56.556 --> 00:16:58.689
you really are gonna spin your...

478
00:16:58.689 --> 00:17:00.523
this is critical thinking.

479
00:17:00.523 --> 00:17:01.601
About living.

480
00:17:01.601 --> 00:17:02.273
<v ->Yes.</v>

481
00:17:02.273 --> 00:17:05.222
And that's the book, the Ageless Living book, right?

482
00:17:05.222 --> 00:17:05.848
<v ->Yes.</v>

483
00:17:05.848 --> 00:17:06.923
It's the Ageless Living book,

484
00:17:06.923 --> 00:17:07.591
Freedom from the Culture of Death.

485
00:17:08.065 --> 00:17:09.150
<v ->Totally.</v>

486
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.033
<v ->Yeah. Yeah.</v>

487
00:17:10.033 --> 00:17:11.837
Well, let's talk about that along this way,

488
00:17:11.837 --> 00:17:13.011
along this journey,

489
00:17:13.011 --> 00:17:14.920
you chose to be a breatharian,

490
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.608
now I am assume you drink fluids.

491
00:17:17.608 --> 00:17:18.130
<v ->Right.</v>

492
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.874
<v ->But you don't eat foods.</v>

493
00:17:19.874 --> 00:17:20.774
<v ->Yeah.</v>

494
00:17:20.774 --> 00:17:23.021
Well, now, you know, listen--

495
00:17:23.021 --> 00:17:24.590
<v ->Back then...</v>

496
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:25.898
those 18 months.

497
00:17:25.898 --> 00:17:27.369
<v ->Oh, yeah. Even not water.</v>

498
00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:29.609
I mean, I drank water maybe...

499
00:17:30.529 --> 00:17:31.842
a sip a week.

500
00:17:31.842 --> 00:17:32.668
<v ->That's it?</v>

501
00:17:32.668 --> 00:17:34.236
<v ->I didn't like, I don't like water.</v>

502
00:17:34.236 --> 00:17:35.111
I don't drink water.

503
00:17:35.111 --> 00:17:36.521
I never drink water.

504
00:17:36.521 --> 00:17:37.893
So, water wasn't an issue, you know?

505
00:17:37.893 --> 00:17:39.796
And when people tell you you have to have

506
00:17:39.796 --> 00:17:43.078
eight cups a day or ten, this is all nonsense.

507
00:17:43.078 --> 00:17:43.860
<v ->Mmm-huh.</v>

508
00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:44.467
<v ->You know.</v>

509
00:17:44.467 --> 00:17:47.273
<v ->Well, you're still here. Obviously.</v>

510
00:17:47.273 --> 00:17:50.302
So, you really chose that path,

511
00:17:50.302 --> 00:17:51.678
because you what...

512
00:17:51.678 --> 00:17:52.862
you wanted to...

513
00:17:52.862 --> 00:17:53.608
see what would happen?

514
00:17:53.608 --> 00:17:55.932
<v ->Yeah, well you see, I'm physically immortal.</v>

515
00:17:55.932 --> 00:17:56.840
<v ->Mmm-huh.</v>

516
00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.472
<v ->And, I feel that way.</v>

517
00:17:58.472 --> 00:18:01.277
I know my body is programmed like this.

518
00:18:01.277 --> 00:18:02.087
<v ->You've chosen.</v>

519
00:18:02.087 --> 00:18:03.261
<v ->I've chosen that.</v>

520
00:18:03.261 --> 00:18:05.025
I choose everything about me.

521
00:18:05.468 --> 00:18:07.719
And then, the moment I knew that,

522
00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:08.775
and I feel good,

523
00:18:08.775 --> 00:18:11.580
then I wanted to try not eating,

524
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.233
because that's another exercise.

525
00:18:13.233 --> 00:18:14.278
<v ->Mmm-huh.</v>

526
00:18:14.278 --> 00:18:16.945
<v ->And so, because if I trust me enough,</v>

527
00:18:16.945 --> 00:18:18.257
and I love myself,

528
00:18:18.257 --> 00:18:20.859
and it's all about self-love, bottom line, you know?

529
00:18:20.859 --> 00:18:23.014
This whole conversation about love.

530
00:18:23.264 --> 00:18:26.267
There's nothing more or less than love.

531
00:18:26.267 --> 00:18:28.073
But real love.

532
00:18:28.073 --> 00:18:30.862
Love of you. Of personally.

533
00:18:30.862 --> 00:18:33.583
How well do you love you?

534
00:18:33.583 --> 00:18:35.161
Do you know you?

535
00:18:35.161 --> 00:18:37.252
How well do I trust me?

536
00:18:37.252 --> 00:18:40.470
How well do I, um...

537
00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.470
Acknowledge who I am as a human being.

538
00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:46.188
And then I develop it further, further, further.

539
00:18:46.188 --> 00:18:47.522
<v ->Mmm-huh.</v>

540
00:18:47.798 --> 00:18:49.231
So, I decided not to eat for a while,

541
00:18:49.231 --> 00:18:51.717
and I have friends who did not do it,

542
00:18:51.717 --> 00:18:55.052
I mean, who quit eating, you know, Jasmuheen.

543
00:18:55.442 --> 00:18:56.925
She's very famous for that.

544
00:18:56.925 --> 00:19:01.186
She actually was profoundly, uh, uh...

545
00:19:03.837 --> 00:19:05.489
a person that affected me.

546
00:19:05.489 --> 00:19:06.706
I read her books and I said,

547
00:19:06.706 --> 00:19:08.883
wow, you know, I gotta do that.

548
00:19:08.883 --> 00:19:10.780
But for me, it was just a side effect,

549
00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.707
side things, you know.

550
00:19:12.707 --> 00:19:14.886
'Cause, I didn't worry about living,

551
00:19:14.886 --> 00:19:16.604
You know, death or alive,

552
00:19:16.604 --> 00:19:17.905
or being sick or here.

553
00:19:17.905 --> 00:19:19.674
<v ->That's true, so it wouldn't be considered a scary thing,</v>

554
00:19:19.674 --> 00:19:20.625
just a different thing.

555
00:19:20.625 --> 00:19:22.043
<v ->Just a different things, yeah.</v>

556
00:19:22.043 --> 00:19:23.064
And I did it, you know,

557
00:19:23.064 --> 00:19:25.072
I started and I did it for 18 months.

558
00:19:25.072 --> 00:19:26.459
It was diificult.

559
00:19:27.689 --> 00:19:28.846
During the time, was perfect.

560
00:19:28.846 --> 00:19:30.169
You know, I really enjoyed it,

561
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:31.695
I was the best I ever been,

562
00:19:31.695 --> 00:19:32.590
in my life, physically.

563
00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:33.820
<v ->Lemme ask you a question,</v>

564
00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:34.829
kind of personal,

565
00:19:34.829 --> 00:19:35.977
'cause I've wondered about this:

566
00:19:35.977 --> 00:19:37.636
What happens to your digestive tract

567
00:19:37.636 --> 00:19:38.538
when you don't eat food for that--

568
00:19:38.538 --> 00:19:40.531
<v ->They collapse.</v>

569
00:19:41.894 --> 00:19:43.056
They collapse in.

570
00:19:43.056 --> 00:19:44.844
They get smaller and tight.

571
00:19:44.844 --> 00:19:46.873
And you lose all your fat.

572
00:19:46.873 --> 00:19:48.089
And then you become....

573
00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:50.979
you live an optimal weight,

574
00:19:50.979 --> 00:19:52.185
youl have an optimal weight.

575
00:19:52.185 --> 00:19:55.300
The body knows exactly how you should be.

576
00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:56.601
You exercise.

577
00:19:56.601 --> 00:19:59.610
Your physical power will double or triple...

578
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.231
when you go to to gym, for example.

579
00:20:03.231 --> 00:20:08.021
I mean, I would hike three more times longer than normal.

580
00:20:08.021 --> 00:20:08.941
No water.

581
00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:11.587
I don't have to carry with me bottles and all this stuff.

582
00:20:11.959 --> 00:20:15.505
<v ->But you're consciously using, I assume...</v>

583
00:20:15.505 --> 00:20:17.005
air, sunlight, prana.

584
00:20:17.005 --> 00:20:19.245
<v ->All you need is to breathe.</v>

585
00:20:19.245 --> 00:20:20.728
<v ->That's all you need is to breathe.</v>

586
00:20:20.728 --> 00:20:23.140
The sun is there every day.

587
00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.515
All you need is two minutes of sun.

588
00:20:25.515 --> 00:20:27.129
That sun is not an issue.

589
00:20:27.129 --> 00:20:28.409
It's breathing.

590
00:20:28.409 --> 00:20:31.594
Everything done with the breath.

591
00:20:31.779 --> 00:20:33.730
We process our...

592
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:39.538
Our nutrition come only from air,

593
00:20:39.538 --> 00:20:41.427
not from the food you eat.

594
00:20:41.427 --> 00:20:44.689
See, we have two system for living.

595
00:20:44.689 --> 00:20:47.410
The lung and the intestines.

596
00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.668
And then, if the intestines shut down totally,

597
00:20:50.668 --> 00:20:54.998
then the lung is working naturally anyway.

598
00:20:54.998 --> 00:20:56.629
Most people get more energy from

599
00:20:56.629 --> 00:20:58.348
their lungs, than from intestines,

600
00:20:58.348 --> 00:20:59.648
than from the food they eat, anyway.

601
00:20:59.648 --> 00:21:00.566
<v ->That is true.</v>

602
00:21:00.566 --> 00:21:02.647
<v ->Yeah, see, the intestine actually...</v>

603
00:21:05.867 --> 00:21:09.237
spend more energy to process the food than it makes.

604
00:21:09.237 --> 00:21:09.761
<v ->Yes.</v>

605
00:21:09.761 --> 00:21:10.902
And we all experience that.

606
00:21:10.902 --> 00:21:11.893
<v ->Yeah.</v>

607
00:21:11.893 --> 00:21:12.907
<v ->We eat a normal kind of diet,</v>

608
00:21:12.907 --> 00:21:13.931
normal for our culture,

609
00:21:13.931 --> 00:21:15.487
which is essentially dead,

610
00:21:15.487 --> 00:21:17.227
most of the things are lifeless,

611
00:21:17.227 --> 00:21:18.602
and you feel tired.

612
00:21:18.602 --> 00:21:20.555
You feel heavy.

613
00:21:20.555 --> 00:21:22.251
You feel less than optimal.

614
00:21:22.251 --> 00:21:24.404
Whereas, sitting down and having a good session

615
00:21:24.404 --> 00:21:27.815
of just breathing with some intention or consciousness

616
00:21:27.815 --> 00:21:29.387
just deep breathing, you feel enlivened.

617
00:21:29.387 --> 00:21:30.964
So that speaks for itself.

618
00:21:30.964 --> 00:21:31.987
<v ->Yeah, you know,</v>

619
00:21:31.987 --> 00:21:32.799
you eat lunch,

620
00:21:32.799 --> 00:21:34.441
that is why there is siesta in the world.

621
00:21:34.441 --> 00:21:36.938
Every country in the world shut between two and four.

622
00:21:36.938 --> 00:21:38.505
<v ->Yeah, once upon a time, it's true.</v>

623
00:21:38.505 --> 00:21:40.009
To digest that food and sleep it off.

624
00:21:40.009 --> 00:21:42.324
<v ->Yeah, because you cannot keep your eyes open,</v>

625
00:21:42.324 --> 00:21:43.807
you have to take a nap.

626
00:21:43.807 --> 00:21:46.760
So, it's become a social event.

627
00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.221
See, this is another thing.

628
00:21:48.221 --> 00:21:49.959
People don't talk about it.

629
00:21:50.969 --> 00:21:52.616
Why would you need to go to sleep after you eat

630
00:21:52.616 --> 00:21:54.930
if you have all this beautiful food and energy

631
00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:57.000
that you just received.

632
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.526
It's not.

633
00:21:58.526 --> 00:21:59.687
<v ->And it's sensual.</v>

634
00:21:59.687 --> 00:22:00.797
People...

635
00:22:00.797 --> 00:22:03.868
We've become accustomed to the taste and the flavors

636
00:22:03.868 --> 00:22:05.986
and the desirous of these things--

637
00:22:05.986 --> 00:22:07.154
<v ->It's addiction.</v>

638
00:22:07.154 --> 00:22:09.202
Everything is within the addiction realm.

639
00:22:09.446 --> 00:22:10.812
Yeah. It's mental.

640
00:22:10.812 --> 00:22:14.001
And, you know, when I told my mom, at the time,

641
00:22:14.001 --> 00:22:15.687
that I'm not eating,

642
00:22:15.687 --> 00:22:17.502
I was talking to her on the phone,

643
00:22:17.502 --> 00:22:19.783
she said, she paused for a minute,

644
00:22:19.783 --> 00:22:21.398
and then she start laughing.

645
00:22:21.398 --> 00:22:22.918
She said, "Oh, what a joke."

646
00:22:22.918 --> 00:22:25.794
She thought I was joking with her.

647
00:22:25.794 --> 00:22:27.600
And I said, "Yeah, Mom, I'm joking."

648
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.209
Because she wouldn't get it.

649
00:22:30.209 --> 00:22:32.019
That I am not eating anymore.

650
00:22:32.249 --> 00:22:33.428
<v ->Yeah.</v>

651
00:22:33.838 --> 00:22:37.440
And that was one of the best time.

652
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.498
But you know, socially, it was difficult,

653
00:22:39.498 --> 00:22:43.509
because then people shy you when they know you don't eat.

654
00:22:43.509 --> 00:22:44.980
They ask so many questions,

655
00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.522
they think something wrong with them that they eating.

656
00:22:47.522 --> 00:22:49.023
They know something is wrong,

657
00:22:49.023 --> 00:22:52.009
but they cannot really do anything about it.

658
00:22:52.009 --> 00:22:54.546
They too much entrenched in food,

659
00:22:54.546 --> 00:22:56.125
and in their beliefs,

660
00:22:56.125 --> 00:22:58.292
and in your medicine,

661
00:22:58.922 --> 00:23:00.510
and their religion,

662
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:01.662
and beside, remember:

663
00:23:01.662 --> 00:23:04.089
food is love for mommies.

664
00:23:04.089 --> 00:23:04.922
<v ->Yes.</v>

665
00:23:04.922 --> 00:23:05.596
For many people.

666
00:23:05.596 --> 00:23:06.858
It is for me, as a mom.

667
00:23:06.858 --> 00:23:08.883
I love cooking and baking.

668
00:23:08.883 --> 00:23:10.942
It's part of my offering is offering

669
00:23:10.942 --> 00:23:14.705
wonderful-tasting sweet things to people that I love.

670
00:23:14.705 --> 00:23:15.608
<v ->Exactly.</v>

671
00:23:15.608 --> 00:23:18.194
<v ->Yeah, and it is a deep part of my culture,</v>

672
00:23:18.194 --> 00:23:19.761
my internal culture,

673
00:23:19.761 --> 00:23:21.231
because I've thought of this:

674
00:23:21.231 --> 00:23:24.305
How would life be without those wonderful flavors?

675
00:23:24.305 --> 00:23:25.223
And I know, you're right,

676
00:23:25.223 --> 00:23:27.207
it's all belief- and addiction-based.

677
00:23:27.207 --> 00:23:27.975
<v ->Yeah.</v>

678
00:23:27.975 --> 00:23:30.917
And like, my mom never said "I love you" to me.

679
00:23:31.227 --> 00:23:32.660
But, she would, every time she sees me,

680
00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.503
when I go to visit, it's a plate, right?

681
00:23:35.503 --> 00:23:36.947
She shoves a plate right in front of me.

682
00:23:36.947 --> 00:23:38.461
Like there's always two or three.

683
00:23:38.461 --> 00:23:40.135
And, Mom, Mom, I don't eat.

684
00:23:40.135 --> 00:23:42.162
But maybe, just in case.

685
00:23:42.162 --> 00:23:44.586
Maybe, should I smell it or something?

686
00:23:44.586 --> 00:23:45.586
It was...

687
00:23:45.586 --> 00:23:46.378
<v ->And you take a sniff.</v>

688
00:23:46.378 --> 00:23:48.382
Well, what happened after you came off of

689
00:23:48.382 --> 00:23:49.993
this 18-month period and integrated kind of

690
00:23:49.993 --> 00:23:53.043
back in a little bit and started eating again.

691
00:23:53.043 --> 00:23:55.293
What happened to your body,

692
00:23:55.293 --> 00:23:57.389
and the digestive system?

693
00:23:57.389 --> 00:23:58.963
Was there a transition?

694
00:23:58.963 --> 00:24:00.679
<v ->Yeah. There is transition,</v>

695
00:24:00.679 --> 00:24:01.959
and start working again,

696
00:24:01.959 --> 00:24:03.880
you know, it's fully...

697
00:24:05.438 --> 00:24:07.193
Uh, you know, functional.

698
00:24:08.331 --> 00:24:12.945
But, really, you have to ease up on using your stomach.

699
00:24:12.945 --> 00:24:13.898
<v ->Yeah.</v>

700
00:24:13.898 --> 00:24:18.132
<v ->So, every time you eat solid food,</v>

701
00:24:18.132 --> 00:24:19.348
then you work very hard,

702
00:24:19.348 --> 00:24:21.641
you lose more energy than you create.

703
00:24:21.641 --> 00:24:22.643
<v ->Salad?</v>

704
00:24:22.643 --> 00:24:23.730
<v ->Solid.</v>

705
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:25.614
<v ->Oh, solid. Solid.</v>

706
00:24:25.614 --> 00:24:28.553
<v ->Yeah. Like, a potato...</v>

707
00:24:28.553 --> 00:24:29.790
<v ->Big plate of pasta, or something.</v>

708
00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:32.583
<v ->Yeah, anything like, pasta is bad, anyway, but...</v>

709
00:24:33.825 --> 00:24:35.834
So, uh, if you drink it.

710
00:24:36.254 --> 00:24:38.507
If you juice it or if you blend it...

711
00:24:39.347 --> 00:24:42.035
then it's easier for this particular food

712
00:24:42.035 --> 00:24:43.869
to move in and out of your system,

713
00:24:43.869 --> 00:24:46.460
like in six, seven hours, instead of 15.

714
00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.174
<v ->Yes.</v>

715
00:24:47.174 --> 00:24:50.047
<v ->And that's the different in time,</v>

716
00:24:50.047 --> 00:24:52.853
in the processing of that food,

717
00:24:53.823 --> 00:24:55.414
that makes a difference,

718
00:24:55.414 --> 00:24:59.526
and then you may save some energy and nutrient,

719
00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:03.022
to function better as a human being.

720
00:25:03.632 --> 00:25:04.692
Yes, no, that's...

721
00:25:04.692 --> 00:25:05.951
And I think a lot of us,

722
00:25:05.951 --> 00:25:07.316
a lot of people watching this right now,

723
00:25:07.316 --> 00:25:08.329
are already getting that.

724
00:25:08.329 --> 00:25:12.092
There's a big movement toward fluids and juicing,

725
00:25:12.092 --> 00:25:13.800
and taking food more in this way.

726
00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.037
Having a shake in the morning

727
00:25:15.037 --> 00:25:17.052
is becoming very commonplace

728
00:25:17.052 --> 00:25:20.056
where, when I started doing that,

729
00:25:20.056 --> 00:25:21.833
many years ago, decades ago,

730
00:25:22.547 --> 00:25:24.296
it wasn't a popular thing to do.

731
00:25:24.296 --> 00:25:26.184
Now, everybody has a shake.

732
00:25:26.184 --> 00:25:27.872
You can go out and buy one

733
00:25:27.872 --> 00:25:29.427
if you don't wanna make one.

734
00:25:29.427 --> 00:25:30.505
<v ->That's right. Yeah.</v>

735
00:25:30.505 --> 00:25:31.901
<v ->So, it is permeating the mass consciousness.</v>

736
00:25:31.901 --> 00:25:33.853
<v ->But, I'll tell you something,</v>

737
00:25:33.853 --> 00:25:36.681
there is certain food which is poisonous to you.

738
00:25:37.031 --> 00:25:38.031
<v ->Yes.</v>

739
00:25:38.401 --> 00:25:40.171
<v ->And, no ifs or buts,</v>

740
00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:42.650
but the culture doesn't even tell you.

741
00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.509
Let's start with tomatoes.

742
00:25:44.509 --> 00:25:45.153
<v ->Yes.</v>

743
00:25:45.153 --> 00:25:46.313
<v ->Tomatoes are poison!</v>

744
00:25:46.313 --> 00:25:47.678
<v ->Nightshade family.</v>

745
00:25:47.678 --> 00:25:50.142
<v ->No, it's a poisonous plant!</v>

746
00:25:50.142 --> 00:25:51.946
Only human eat it!

747
00:25:53.396 --> 00:25:56.297
No animal in the world would eat a tomato...

748
00:25:56.817 --> 00:25:58.230
of any kind.

749
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:59.849
Doesn't matter what's its color.

750
00:25:59.849 --> 00:26:04.073
It's so acidic, it's startling.

751
00:26:04.073 --> 00:26:05.438
And it's a poison, too.

752
00:26:05.438 --> 00:26:07.710
So, you can Google it if you don't trust my word.

753
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:08.559
<v ->No, it's true.</v>

754
00:26:08.559 --> 00:26:09.737
Belladonna. It's part of the nightshade family, it is.

755
00:26:09.737 --> 00:26:12.819
<v ->But not only that it's nightshade, it's poison.</v>

756
00:26:12.819 --> 00:26:15.464
There's other nightshades that we eat,

757
00:26:15.464 --> 00:26:17.352
they not poisonous to us.

758
00:26:17.352 --> 00:26:20.115
This is poisonous plant.

759
00:26:20.115 --> 00:26:20.851
<v ->Interesting.</v>

760
00:26:20.851 --> 00:26:24.370
<v ->If you put "tomato, poison" and read about it.</v>

761
00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:26.322
<v ->There's some famous stories throughout history</v>

762
00:26:26.322 --> 00:26:28.295
about the person that first stood

763
00:26:28.295 --> 00:26:28.946
on the courthouse steps

764
00:26:28.946 --> 00:26:30.674
and ate a tomato publicly back east,

765
00:26:30.674 --> 00:26:32.279
many years ago,

766
00:26:32.279 --> 00:26:33.681
to get people into showing them

767
00:26:33.681 --> 00:26:34.881
they weren't going to die,

768
00:26:34.881 --> 00:26:36.241
you don't have to be afraid of 'em.

769
00:26:36.241 --> 00:26:38.017
But they were afraid, you're saying, for a reason.

770
00:26:38.017 --> 00:26:39.536
The lore was: these are poisonous.

771
00:26:39.723 --> 00:26:41.493
And, you know, they tell you they have lycopene in them,

772
00:26:41.493 --> 00:26:43.481
it's good for you if you have a cancer.

773
00:26:43.481 --> 00:26:44.628
This is all nonsense.

774
00:26:44.628 --> 00:26:46.014
The more you eat 'em,

775
00:26:46.014 --> 00:26:47.742
the faster you die.

776
00:26:47.742 --> 00:26:48.308
<v ->Interesting.</v>

777
00:26:48.308 --> 00:26:50.601
<v ->Yeah, especially for cancer patient.</v>

778
00:26:50.601 --> 00:26:53.331
So, they not telling you the real truth, you know?

779
00:26:53.331 --> 00:26:55.667
Because the lycopene is mean nothing,

780
00:26:55.667 --> 00:26:57.822
in compare to the amount of acidity

781
00:26:57.822 --> 00:26:59.815
that it causes in the body.

782
00:26:59.815 --> 00:27:02.111
The second thing is mushrooms.

783
00:27:02.111 --> 00:27:02.880
<v ->Mmm.</v>

784
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.323
<v ->Yeah, all mushrooms are fungus.</v>

785
00:27:05.323 --> 00:27:06.241
We call them fungus.

786
00:27:06.241 --> 00:27:07.552
That's their real name,

787
00:27:07.552 --> 00:27:11.157
and then we eat them because it's nice things to do.

788
00:27:11.157 --> 00:27:12.959
It's an Italian this,

789
00:27:12.959 --> 00:27:15.211
and they come from here...

790
00:27:15.211 --> 00:27:17.204
There's nothing good about mushroom.

791
00:27:17.204 --> 00:27:18.356
Zero.

792
00:27:19.556 --> 00:27:21.204
They've never been medicinal.

793
00:27:21.204 --> 00:27:22.867
It's just a new name for them.

794
00:27:22.867 --> 00:27:23.519
You know?

795
00:27:23.519 --> 00:27:25.747
It will kill you faster,

796
00:27:25.747 --> 00:27:28.500
and the frequency of the mushroom is the fungus.

797
00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:29.797
And if you eat it,

798
00:27:29.797 --> 00:27:31.967
it will show up in your body.

799
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:36.407
And remember: every cancer is a fungus.

800
00:27:38.189 --> 00:27:41.047
Every tumor is a fungus growth.

801
00:27:41.694 --> 00:27:43.453
<v ->Yeah, that's what Dr. Simoncini...</v>

802
00:27:43.453 --> 00:27:45.123
<v ->Simoncini. Yeah.</v>

803
00:27:45.123 --> 00:27:46.818
He's the latest one to talk about it.

804
00:27:46.818 --> 00:27:47.209
<v ->Yes.</v>

805
00:27:47.209 --> 00:27:48.360
<v ->So you need to know that.</v>

806
00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:52.344
You need to avoid fungus in every way possible.

807
00:27:52.934 --> 00:27:54.399
<v ->Makes sense.</v>

808
00:27:55.297 --> 00:27:58.400
I mean, you eating a fruit that called fungus.

809
00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.756
I mean, how far can you go, you know?

810
00:28:02.756 --> 00:28:04.397
Please change!

811
00:28:04.397 --> 00:28:06.281
<v ->Okay, so we have tomatoes, we have mushrooms, what else?</v>

812
00:28:06.281 --> 00:28:07.514
<v ->And garlic.</v>

813
00:28:08.414 --> 00:28:10.047
Garlic is also poison.

814
00:28:10.867 --> 00:28:12.670
Homeopathically, it's a poison,

815
00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:14.194
because, once you eat it,

816
00:28:14.194 --> 00:28:15.912
the body wanna get rid of it right away.

817
00:28:15.912 --> 00:28:18.178
That's why you sweat it from you.

818
00:28:18.178 --> 00:28:19.785
You sweat it out.

819
00:28:19.785 --> 00:28:21.469
Start stinking with smell of garlic.

820
00:28:22.002 --> 00:28:23.261
Why that happen?

821
00:28:23.261 --> 00:28:24.968
<v ->Isn't it heavily sulfurous?</v>

822
00:28:24.968 --> 00:28:27.037
<v ->I don't know the detail of it,</v>

823
00:28:27.037 --> 00:28:28.093
but it's a poison.

824
00:28:28.093 --> 00:28:29.438
It's pure poison.

825
00:28:29.438 --> 00:28:31.687
That's why you have a headache,

826
00:28:31.687 --> 00:28:33.832
your head get lighter,

827
00:28:33.832 --> 00:28:36.102
and it ferment your bowel,

828
00:28:36.102 --> 00:28:39.164
and just to get rid of it as soon as possible.

829
00:28:39.164 --> 00:28:42.278
So the more you eat, it's bad for you.

830
00:28:42.278 --> 00:28:45.329
So you avoid that, you avoid salt.

831
00:28:45.329 --> 00:28:46.440
Salt.

832
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.360
Everybody wanna sell you a salt.

833
00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.006
Everybody has sea salt, Egyptian salt,

834
00:28:52.006 --> 00:28:55.479
Celtic salt, English salt,

835
00:28:55.479 --> 00:28:57.932
Anything, that just, oh, this is the new...

836
00:28:58.558 --> 00:29:00.739
All salt is poison.

837
00:29:01.075 --> 00:29:02.465
It's a preservative.

838
00:29:02.465 --> 00:29:03.480
It's chemicals.

839
00:29:05.195 --> 00:29:08.458
<v ->Even the natural ones from evaporated sea water?</v>

840
00:29:08.458 --> 00:29:09.751
<v ->Yeah, it's all salt.</v>

841
00:29:09.751 --> 00:29:10.802
You don't need salt.

842
00:29:10.802 --> 00:29:12.968
There is enough salt in the air.

843
00:29:12.968 --> 00:29:14.215
In the water.

844
00:29:14.215 --> 00:29:15.574
In every vegetable.

845
00:29:16.264 --> 00:29:18.730
More than enough!

846
00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:21.714
You know, if you add one grain of salt,

847
00:29:21.714 --> 00:29:24.211
that grain of salt has all the minerals

848
00:29:24.211 --> 00:29:26.203
you already need for the day.

849
00:29:26.763 --> 00:29:28.754
So, if you have, you do this twice, three times,

850
00:29:28.754 --> 00:29:30.578
you have so much minerals,

851
00:29:30.578 --> 00:29:33.181
then that will affect your hormones,

852
00:29:33.181 --> 00:29:34.215
and suddenly you don't know

853
00:29:34.215 --> 00:29:35.976
what's happening with you.

854
00:29:35.976 --> 00:29:38.007
Why are my hormones crazy?

855
00:29:38.007 --> 00:29:39.592
It's not working.

856
00:29:40.912 --> 00:29:42.941
They going up and down. Spiking.

857
00:29:42.941 --> 00:29:44.108
Salt!

858
00:29:44.893 --> 00:29:46.870
You preserve yourself suddenly.

859
00:29:47.837 --> 00:29:50.383
Salt is an aging thing, you know.

860
00:29:50.383 --> 00:29:53.263
Most of heart problems is because of salt.

861
00:29:54.473 --> 00:29:55.679
But they don't tell you!

862
00:29:55.679 --> 00:29:57.875
It's a secret! Nobody cares!

863
00:29:58.595 --> 00:29:59.498
You know?

864
00:29:59.498 --> 00:30:01.204
Listen, if you'd be healthy,

865
00:30:01.204 --> 00:30:02.931
nobody gonna make money!

866
00:30:02.931 --> 00:30:07.079
<v ->We do understand those agendas. Yes.</v>

867
00:30:08.319 --> 00:30:10.505
<v ->You know, the doctor's has a job, for god's sake.</v>

868
00:30:11.177 --> 00:30:14.249
<v ->And you know, he want have anything to see or to say.</v>

869
00:30:14.249 --> 00:30:16.634
And then the medication and all this...

870
00:30:17.614 --> 00:30:18.514
It's all about salt.

871
00:30:18.514 --> 00:30:19.880
Cut the salt!

872
00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.704
Most of the time if you cut the salt,

873
00:30:21.704 --> 00:30:22.802
you cut a lots of stuff.

874
00:30:22.802 --> 00:30:23.897
<v ->That's true.</v>

875
00:30:23.897 --> 00:30:25.796
Most of the people who go on strict vegan,

876
00:30:25.796 --> 00:30:26.759
or macrobiotic diets,

877
00:30:26.759 --> 00:30:28.232
usually, they cut out the salt first.

878
00:30:28.232 --> 00:30:30.485
<v ->Right, but there's more.</v>

879
00:30:30.485 --> 00:30:34.050
See, the next one is soy product.

880
00:30:36.087 --> 00:30:38.820
There is no good soy product.

881
00:30:39.189 --> 00:30:40.359
There isn't.

882
00:30:40.359 --> 00:30:42.229
Not edamame bean.

883
00:30:42.229 --> 00:30:45.140
Not soy drinks, soy lattes.

884
00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:46.491
Not, um...

885
00:30:48.139 --> 00:30:49.620
tofu of any kind.

886
00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:50.473
<v ->Mmm-huh.</v>

887
00:30:50.473 --> 00:30:52.800
<v ->Not any replacement meat.</v>

888
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.723
All these are poisonous to your body,

889
00:30:54.723 --> 00:30:56.939
directly make you sick.

890
00:30:58.729 --> 00:31:00.095
<v ->Personally, they do make me sick.</v>

891
00:31:00.095 --> 00:31:00.947
I can't eat it.

892
00:31:01.507 --> 00:31:05.106
<v ->Because, soy, the way we eat it in this country,</v>

893
00:31:05.106 --> 00:31:07.159
and nobody really do it right.

894
00:31:08.559 --> 00:31:10.326
It's poisonous.

895
00:31:10.326 --> 00:31:14.443
Soybean is the number one poisonous legume in the world.

896
00:31:14.743 --> 00:31:15.480
<v ->Yes.</v>

897
00:31:16.021 --> 00:31:17.440
<v ->We all know it.</v>

898
00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.677
<v ->No, most people don't know it.</v>

899
00:31:18.677 --> 00:31:20.288
And they're still eating a lot of soy

900
00:31:20.288 --> 00:31:22.314
as an alternative to other things.

901
00:31:22.314 --> 00:31:24.148
<v ->Yeah, but you see, when everybody tell you:</v>

902
00:31:24.148 --> 00:31:26.569
Oh, the Chinese eat it and the Japanese eat it.

903
00:31:26.569 --> 00:31:28.681
Yeah, they eat so little.

904
00:31:28.681 --> 00:31:31.177
And the soy they eat, they ferment.

905
00:31:31.177 --> 00:31:32.969
There is such a way to ferment it--

906
00:31:32.969 --> 00:31:34.046
<v ->Such as tempeh--</v>

907
00:31:34.046 --> 00:31:37.012
<v ->Yeah, but the tempeh here...</v>

908
00:31:37.012 --> 00:31:38.402
<v ->Is different than there--</v>

909
00:31:38.402 --> 00:31:39.209
<v ->It's different.</v>

910
00:31:39.209 --> 00:31:40.828
It is poison here.

911
00:31:40.828 --> 00:31:42.278
Here, it is a poison.

912
00:31:42.278 --> 00:31:43.294
You do not touch it.

913
00:31:44.182 --> 00:31:46.598
You do not touch any soy products here.

914
00:31:46.598 --> 00:31:47.987
You know, edamame bean.

915
00:31:48.455 --> 00:31:49.833
We love it, remember?

916
00:31:49.833 --> 00:31:52.541
But if you eat five or six of them?

917
00:31:52.541 --> 00:31:55.122
Your blood will slow in flowing,

918
00:31:55.122 --> 00:31:56.563
for the next 10 minutes.

919
00:31:56.908 --> 00:31:58.259
<v ->It's so poisonous.</v>

920
00:31:58.259 --> 00:32:00.221
<v ->I believe that. I get really sick eating that.</v>

921
00:32:00.221 --> 00:32:02.130
<v ->I'm telling you.</v>

922
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:03.945
And then the next one is,

923
00:32:03.945 --> 00:32:07.061
which is even worse than all, is citrus.

924
00:32:08.071 --> 00:32:08.892
<v ->Ooh.</v>

925
00:32:09.362 --> 00:32:10.343
<v ->Yeah. Orange.</v>

926
00:32:10.343 --> 00:32:11.015
<v ->All citrus?</v>

927
00:32:11.015 --> 00:32:12.083
<v ->All citrus. Orange.</v>

928
00:32:12.083 --> 00:32:13.230
<v ->Including lemons?</v>

929
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:16.620
<v ->Lemon. Grapefruit. Mandarin. Clementine.</v>

930
00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:19.638
It's so delicious, but they pure acid.

931
00:32:20.528 --> 00:32:23.702
And they make you sicker than ever before.

932
00:32:25.172 --> 00:32:28.884
And if you take one orange juice in the morning,

933
00:32:28.884 --> 00:32:30.707
you screwed up the whole day.

934
00:32:30.707 --> 00:32:31.220
<v ->Yeah.</v>

935
00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.617
<v ->That day is gone.</v>

936
00:32:32.617 --> 00:32:33.982
And then you wonder, what's wrong?

937
00:32:33.982 --> 00:32:37.065
I had my oranges! I had my vitamin C.

938
00:32:37.065 --> 00:32:39.944
Oh, no, doesn't work like this.

939
00:32:39.944 --> 00:32:41.736
It's a fallacy.

940
00:32:41.736 --> 00:32:45.242
You know, we have a lotsa stories about these things.

941
00:32:45.242 --> 00:32:46.802
And you know, it's an industry,

942
00:32:46.802 --> 00:32:49.405
and they sell it to you and they make the research.

943
00:32:49.405 --> 00:32:51.602
That same industry make everything for you.

944
00:32:51.602 --> 00:32:52.839
All the marketing,

945
00:32:52.839 --> 00:32:53.789
so you don't have to think.

946
00:32:53.789 --> 00:32:56.583
You think, oh, my god, it's oranges from Florida.

947
00:32:56.583 --> 00:32:59.336
The sun and the beauty,

948
00:33:00.356 --> 00:33:02.068
but they don't tell you how poisonous it is

949
00:33:02.068 --> 00:33:04.363
to your body for the long-term.

950
00:33:04.583 --> 00:33:06.193
And you know, people who cannot walk,

951
00:33:06.193 --> 00:33:07.303
they have joint issues,

952
00:33:07.303 --> 00:33:10.912
every joint issues started with the citrus.

953
00:33:11.889 --> 00:33:12.603
<v ->Interesting.</v>

954
00:33:12.603 --> 00:33:13.421
<v ->Yeah.</v>

955
00:33:13.611 --> 00:33:15.070
You cut the citrus,

956
00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:16.577
most people who have joint issues

957
00:33:16.577 --> 00:33:18.130
will be fine in three months.

958
00:33:18.444 --> 00:33:20.802
<v ->Because it's such a part of Western culture</v>

959
00:33:20.802 --> 00:33:21.761
to have a glass of juice in the morning.

960
00:33:21.761 --> 00:33:24.156
<v ->Yeah, this is all nonsense.</v>

961
00:33:24.156 --> 00:33:25.238
<v ->Yeah.</v>

962
00:33:25.238 --> 00:33:25.985
<v ->Interesting.</v>

963
00:33:25.985 --> 00:33:27.786
<v ->Three months. You cut it.</v>

964
00:33:27.786 --> 00:33:29.642
After three months, you'll see.

965
00:33:29.642 --> 00:33:31.689
You'll have no problem with joints,

966
00:33:31.689 --> 00:33:32.756
your legs if be fine.

967
00:33:32.756 --> 00:33:35.509
You don't have to have the surgery anymore.

968
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:37.855
<v ->What happens with things like coffee or caffeine?</v>

969
00:33:37.855 --> 00:33:40.087
<v ->Coffee is acid, too.</v>

970
00:33:40.087 --> 00:33:40.902
<v ->Yeah.</v>

971
00:33:40.902 --> 00:33:43.442
All these things you're speaking of are acidic.

972
00:33:43.442 --> 00:33:44.691
<v ->Well, coffee affects other things,</v>

973
00:33:44.691 --> 00:33:46.334
but it's still acid.

974
00:33:46.334 --> 00:33:48.670
I mean, a little coffee, you know,

975
00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:50.396
I'll let you pass.

976
00:33:51.336 --> 00:33:54.746
But you cannot have two cups of coffee a day.

977
00:33:54.746 --> 00:33:55.934
You know, like, just a little bit.

978
00:33:55.934 --> 00:34:00.124
Like, few grain of coffee, like sparkle it in something.

979
00:34:00.124 --> 00:34:01.276
It's fine.

980
00:34:01.276 --> 00:34:04.047
I mean, it'll give you a little good, or whatever,

981
00:34:04.047 --> 00:34:05.791
it smell good, too.

982
00:34:06.781 --> 00:34:07.507
It's nice.

983
00:34:07.507 --> 00:34:09.097
But a lot of coffee is no, no way.

984
00:34:09.097 --> 00:34:10.599
<v ->Because, again, acid, acid.</v>

985
00:34:10.599 --> 00:34:11.730
Everything here is acid, acid.

986
00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:12.306
<v ->Everything is acid.</v>

987
00:34:12.306 --> 00:34:13.746
Also with the teas.

988
00:34:13.746 --> 00:34:14.439
Teas.

989
00:34:14.439 --> 00:34:19.377
If it does not say herbal tea on the box,

990
00:34:19.377 --> 00:34:21.821
it's not herbal and you don't wanna drink it.

991
00:34:21.821 --> 00:34:24.241
Just because the color of it is green.

992
00:34:24.241 --> 00:34:26.246
When you see green tea,

993
00:34:26.246 --> 00:34:28.343
it doesn't mean it's good for you.

994
00:34:28.343 --> 00:34:31.168
It has to be herbal green tea.

995
00:34:32.551 --> 00:34:33.344
<v ->Yes.</v>

996
00:34:33.542 --> 00:34:35.398
<v ->People don't know that.</v>

997
00:34:35.398 --> 00:34:36.598
They say, oh, but it's herbal.

998
00:34:36.598 --> 00:34:38.043
You know, it's a plant.

999
00:34:38.043 --> 00:34:39.072
No.

1000
00:34:39.632 --> 00:34:41.381
Doesn't make us difference.

1001
00:34:42.651 --> 00:34:45.314
Most of the plants are acidic.

1002
00:34:46.005 --> 00:34:47.711
90% of them are acidic.

1003
00:34:47.711 --> 00:34:50.997
There's system process to take the acidity out,

1004
00:34:50.997 --> 00:34:52.788
to take the poison out.

1005
00:34:52.788 --> 00:34:55.592
To take, you know, whatever it is you don't want there.

1006
00:34:55.592 --> 00:34:57.332
<v ->Well, this is very enlightening, this list.</v>

1007
00:34:57.332 --> 00:34:58.687
I'm sure everybody's written it down.

1008
00:34:58.687 --> 00:35:02.355
If not, rewind and listen to it, write it down--

1009
00:35:02.355 --> 00:35:03.685
<v ->I'm a little strict.</v>

1010
00:35:03.685 --> 00:35:05.613
<v ->Well, you know, interestingly...</v>

1011
00:35:06.103 --> 00:35:08.894
with only two exceptions on this list,

1012
00:35:09.684 --> 00:35:11.584
every single one of these are things I don't eat

1013
00:35:11.584 --> 00:35:13.695
because they make me feel bad.

1014
00:35:13.695 --> 00:35:16.174
I feel sick or lose my energy on those foods.

1015
00:35:16.458 --> 00:35:19.430
So, I'm really not surprised at this list.

1016
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:21.656
It's quite interesting.

1017
00:35:21.813 --> 00:35:24.737
<v ->Yeah, everything that is white color...</v>

1018
00:35:25.427 --> 00:35:26.452
you need to avoid.

1019
00:35:26.452 --> 00:35:28.417
Like, all the sugars are white.

1020
00:35:28.417 --> 00:35:29.769
Sugar replacements are white.

1021
00:35:29.769 --> 00:35:31.266
Salt is white.

1022
00:35:31.266 --> 00:35:33.098
The milk is white.

1023
00:35:33.098 --> 00:35:34.827
The soymilk is white.

1024
00:35:34.827 --> 00:35:36.307
The mayonaisse white.

1025
00:35:36.307 --> 00:35:37.897
The white rice is white.

1026
00:35:37.897 --> 00:35:38.750
The white bread is white.

1027
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:40.840
If you avoid all this, you're fine.

1028
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:42.537
It's white. Just no white.

1029
00:35:42.537 --> 00:35:43.945
<v ->Have vital, alive, colorful foods.</v>

1030
00:35:43.945 --> 00:35:45.448
<v ->Yeah. Color is good.</v>

1031
00:35:45.448 --> 00:35:47.252
<v ->So, we're back, you're eating a little bit of food,</v>

1032
00:35:47.252 --> 00:35:49.885
and you're drinking your smoothie in the morning

1033
00:35:49.885 --> 00:35:51.954
with really super nutrients, you know...

1034
00:35:52.723 --> 00:35:55.410
<v ->Hemp protein is the best.</v>

1035
00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:57.344
<v ->And it tastes good, too.</v>

1036
00:35:57.344 --> 00:35:58.706
<v ->Yeah, it taste pretty good.</v>

1037
00:35:58.706 --> 00:36:01.077
Um, you know...

1038
00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:04.578
Again, you know,

1039
00:36:04.578 --> 00:36:06.323
you make your shake in the morning,

1040
00:36:06.323 --> 00:36:08.659
you don't have to add so many things in it.

1041
00:36:08.659 --> 00:36:10.248
Just for the fun, you know,

1042
00:36:10.248 --> 00:36:11.816
give a kick,

1043
00:36:11.816 --> 00:36:13.875
make your inner child happy

1044
00:36:13.875 --> 00:36:16.362
when you are eating something sweet and nice.

1045
00:36:16.362 --> 00:36:17.875
<v ->But basically,</v>

1046
00:36:17.875 --> 00:36:20.059
lighten up on just food consumption overall.

1047
00:36:20.059 --> 00:36:21.596
We get that part now. We hear you.

1048
00:36:21.596 --> 00:36:23.168
And we all know what it feels like

1049
00:36:23.168 --> 00:36:24.767
to be really tired after your meal.

1050
00:36:25.375 --> 00:36:28.058
<v ->If you can cut your meal by third.</v>

1051
00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:30.922
One-third.

1052
00:36:30.922 --> 00:36:33.075
You'll be the happiest person in the world.

1053
00:36:33.075 --> 00:36:34.357
<v ->That's very good.</v>

1054
00:36:34.357 --> 00:36:35.696
<v ->You take whatever you have, third.</v>

1055
00:36:35.696 --> 00:36:36.976
You eat one-third.

1056
00:36:36.976 --> 00:36:38.739
Save the other two pieces,

1057
00:36:38.739 --> 00:36:40.729
like, make it, third, third, third,

1058
00:36:40.729 --> 00:36:43.429
and eat it like two hours later or three hours later.

1059
00:36:43.429 --> 00:36:45.427
Since people are watching this

1060
00:36:45.427 --> 00:36:47.326
right around the first of the year,

1061
00:36:47.326 --> 00:36:48.500
that's a really good idea,

1062
00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:49.864
because most of us have over-consumed

1063
00:36:49.864 --> 00:36:50.920
leading up to this moment,

1064
00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:54.110
so this is a good time to start looking at this seriously.

1065
00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:56.733
<v ->Yeah, otherwise you're gonna fall asleep.</v>

1066
00:36:56.733 --> 00:36:57.854
You're gonna lose energy.

1067
00:36:57.854 --> 00:36:59.400
Basically, we talking about energy.

1068
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.692
And energy, it's all frequency.

1069
00:37:01.692 --> 00:37:03.555
Life force. It's all about--

1070
00:37:03.555 --> 00:37:04.647
<v ->Let's get into that,</v>

1071
00:37:04.647 --> 00:37:05.927
because that's what you're doing.

1072
00:37:05.927 --> 00:37:07.817
That's what your doing.

1073
00:37:07.817 --> 00:37:10.949
I know you do the vital energetic balancing,

1074
00:37:10.949 --> 00:37:13.853
and it's a really interesting and very kind of futuristic,

1075
00:37:13.853 --> 00:37:16.174
almost, topic in the way it's done.

1076
00:37:16.174 --> 00:37:18.112
First of all, explain...

1077
00:37:18.662 --> 00:37:20.723
There was something I was going to ask you a moment ago,

1078
00:37:20.723 --> 00:37:22.074
about the subconcious mind,

1079
00:37:22.074 --> 00:37:23.376
and its effect on the immune system.

1080
00:37:23.376 --> 00:37:25.307
The first and secondary healings

1081
00:37:25.307 --> 00:37:27.750
that you say take place within the being,

1082
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:30.267
and I don't know if it's best to launch into that now,

1083
00:37:30.267 --> 00:37:32.325
or go right to the energetic balancing.

1084
00:37:32.325 --> 00:37:33.840
<v ->Let's go to the energetic balancing first.</v>

1085
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.162
We may cover that.

1086
00:37:35.162 --> 00:37:35.898
<v ->Okay.</v>

1087
00:37:35.898 --> 00:37:38.053
<v ->Energetic balancing is, basically,</v>

1088
00:37:38.053 --> 00:37:41.732
we need to understand that we are energetic beings.

1089
00:37:41.732 --> 00:37:44.477
We are, I am, 100% energy.

1090
00:37:45.467 --> 00:37:49.956
There's a bag of skin, of me and my shape,

1091
00:37:49.956 --> 00:37:51.620
and inside it, there is water,

1092
00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:52.901
like 90% water.

1093
00:37:52.901 --> 00:37:53.977
It's a container of water.

1094
00:37:53.977 --> 00:37:56.558
<v ->We're a skin suit with water and energy.</v>

1095
00:37:56.558 --> 00:37:58.041
<v ->Yeah, it's skin bag, I call it.</v>

1096
00:37:58.041 --> 00:37:58.649
<v ->Yeah. Skin bag.</v>

1097
00:37:58.649 --> 00:38:00.644
<v ->Full of water!</v>

1098
00:38:00.644 --> 00:38:02.275
And there's couple of batteries

1099
00:38:02.275 --> 00:38:04.974
that makes me move and that's it.

1100
00:38:04.974 --> 00:38:06.521
That's all we are.

1101
00:38:06.521 --> 00:38:07.617
We're water.

1102
00:38:07.617 --> 00:38:09.064
That's all we are.

1103
00:38:09.064 --> 00:38:10.253
And therefore, if we're nothing but water,

1104
00:38:10.253 --> 00:38:12.274
there's nothing to cut.

1105
00:38:12.274 --> 00:38:14.116
We are shape-shifters.

1106
00:38:14.116 --> 00:38:14.947
You need to know,

1107
00:38:14.947 --> 00:38:18.137
if you doctor tells you you have a disease,

1108
00:38:18.137 --> 00:38:19.096
or some dysfunction,

1109
00:38:19.096 --> 00:38:20.782
and there's nothing you can do about it,

1110
00:38:20.782 --> 00:38:22.328
you know he is lying.

1111
00:38:22.328 --> 00:38:23.139
<v ->He doesn't know better.</v>

1112
00:38:23.139 --> 00:38:24.460
<v ->He doesn't know any better.</v>

1113
00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:25.774
Because it's all water,

1114
00:38:25.774 --> 00:38:27.543
and you can change it.

1115
00:38:27.543 --> 00:38:29.858
We can shape-shift all the time.

1116
00:38:29.858 --> 00:38:32.482
Actually, we do shape-shift.

1117
00:38:32.482 --> 00:38:35.671
Our head shrink every 11 second,

1118
00:38:35.671 --> 00:38:38.626
and widen every 11 second.

1119
00:38:38.626 --> 00:38:41.825
We always move, like this, constantly.

1120
00:38:41.825 --> 00:38:45.903
Our coccyx move up and down every 11 second.

1121
00:38:45.903 --> 00:38:47.900
This is the cranial rhythm.

1122
00:38:48.686 --> 00:38:50.248
<v ->Cranial rhythm that goes in the head</v>

1123
00:38:50.248 --> 00:38:51.137
all the way in the body.

1124
00:38:51.137 --> 00:38:53.046
We all change, all the time, constantly.

1125
00:38:53.046 --> 00:38:55.094
We never not change.

1126
00:38:55.094 --> 00:38:58.079
But now, the doctors are not gonna tell you that.

1127
00:38:58.079 --> 00:38:59.082
It's not a conversation.

1128
00:38:59.082 --> 00:39:00.351
Nobody knows about it.

1129
00:39:00.351 --> 00:39:03.279
It's hush-hush conversation.

1130
00:39:03.689 --> 00:39:06.643
So, because, as far as they're concerned,

1131
00:39:06.643 --> 00:39:08.789
we are solid,

1132
00:39:08.789 --> 00:39:10.474
because they can cut you, and nuke you,

1133
00:39:10.474 --> 00:39:12.692
and paste you, and medicate you.

1134
00:39:12.692 --> 00:39:13.299
<v ->Yes.</v>

1135
00:39:13.299 --> 00:39:15.069
<v ->Yeah. And Band-Aid it.</v>

1136
00:39:15.069 --> 00:39:18.281
<v ->So, that's a different approach of thinking.</v>

1137
00:39:18.281 --> 00:39:20.805
So, for me, if I wanna change something,

1138
00:39:20.805 --> 00:39:22.826
it's all water, I can change it.

1139
00:39:23.026 --> 00:39:25.056
If it's energy, I can tweak it.

1140
00:39:25.056 --> 00:39:26.526
It's a frequency.

1141
00:39:26.526 --> 00:39:27.475
<v ->Mmm-huh.</v>

1142
00:39:27.475 --> 00:39:31.699
<v ->So my technology, as such, called energetic balancing,</v>

1143
00:39:31.699 --> 00:39:34.312
and it's all quantum mechanics technology,

1144
00:39:34.312 --> 00:39:36.904
I developed through the years.

1145
00:39:37.764 --> 00:39:40.724
I calculate everything mathematically, basically.

1146
00:39:42.934 --> 00:39:45.288
I'll do nothing but math,

1147
00:39:45.288 --> 00:39:47.485
so my computer does the math, basically.

1148
00:39:48.385 --> 00:39:50.066
So once I know who you are,

1149
00:39:50.066 --> 00:39:52.914
I create an energy signature of the person.

1150
00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.135
<v ->And then we calculate that person</v>

1151
00:39:56.135 --> 00:39:58.309
as an undefined point in space.

1152
00:39:59.388 --> 00:40:02.514
And then we locate, once we do that,

1153
00:40:02.514 --> 00:40:04.689
we can read one-hundredth of a second

1154
00:40:04.689 --> 00:40:07.858
of the heat coming out of that person's body.

1155
00:40:08.998 --> 00:40:10.491
Now, let's talk about that.

1156
00:40:10.491 --> 00:40:13.946
See, there's the heat coming out of you all the time.

1157
00:40:13.946 --> 00:40:14.758
Constantly.

1158
00:40:14.758 --> 00:40:16.944
What is this heat?

1159
00:40:16.944 --> 00:40:18.253
Why there is a heat?

1160
00:40:18.253 --> 00:40:19.205
<v ->Mmm-huh.</v>

1161
00:40:19.205 --> 00:40:20.880
<v ->You know, what is it?</v>

1162
00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:21.691
It's a thermal energy.

1163
00:40:21.691 --> 00:40:22.565
It's a kinetic energy.

1164
00:40:22.565 --> 00:40:25.147
Yes, because we're human, we think it is.

1165
00:40:25.147 --> 00:40:27.931
But, really, it's a magentic energy.

1166
00:40:27.931 --> 00:40:31.046
And this heat is all information

1167
00:40:31.046 --> 00:40:33.701
that the body is sending out

1168
00:40:33.701 --> 00:40:36.165
24 hours a day, 7 days a week,

1169
00:40:36.165 --> 00:40:40.296
to tell the universe and the world who you are.

1170
00:40:40.751 --> 00:40:42.725
It's like, me, me, me.

1171
00:40:42.725 --> 00:40:44.322
I am this, and I am that,

1172
00:40:44.322 --> 00:40:45.966
and that's what I do,

1173
00:40:45.966 --> 00:40:46.596
and that's where I live,

1174
00:40:46.596 --> 00:40:47.386
and that's how I do,

1175
00:40:47.386 --> 00:40:48.153
this is myself.

1176
00:40:48.153 --> 00:40:50.169
Every little cell in our body

1177
00:40:50.169 --> 00:40:54.216
send a frequency out to tell the world who it is.

1178
00:40:54.659 --> 00:40:55.651
And the reason we do it,

1179
00:40:55.651 --> 00:40:57.688
this is how we, human,

1180
00:40:57.688 --> 00:40:59.288
communicate with the universe,

1181
00:40:59.288 --> 00:41:01.223
with the collective consciousness.

1182
00:41:01.223 --> 00:41:02.135
We're not alone.

1183
00:41:02.135 --> 00:41:05.848
So, all this information is being collected.

1184
00:41:05.848 --> 00:41:09.282
And there is an entity called collective consciousness.

1185
00:41:09.282 --> 00:41:10.061
<v ->Yes.</v>

1186
00:41:10.061 --> 00:41:13.187
<v ->And, metaphorically, it's like a giant supercomputer.</v>

1187
00:41:13.187 --> 00:41:16.067
It collect all this information from all over the world,

1188
00:41:16.067 --> 00:41:17.666
from everything living,

1189
00:41:17.666 --> 00:41:19.681
and then we share that information.

1190
00:41:19.681 --> 00:41:22.381
See, during the day we send,

1191
00:41:22.381 --> 00:41:24.162
we, we, we, who we are,

1192
00:41:24.162 --> 00:41:25.346
we tell that story,

1193
00:41:25.346 --> 00:41:26.871
and a night, when we sleep,

1194
00:41:26.871 --> 00:41:29.985
we receive back information to correct, remember--

1195
00:41:29.985 --> 00:41:31.201
<v ->And that's when healing happens--</v>

1196
00:41:31.201 --> 00:41:32.812
<v ->Only at night.</v>

1197
00:41:32.812 --> 00:41:35.287
When you receive the correct information.

1198
00:41:35.287 --> 00:41:37.355
Now, normally, we get the correct information,

1199
00:41:37.355 --> 00:41:39.936
but information can get lost.

1200
00:41:39.936 --> 00:41:40.992
Misunderstood.

1201
00:41:40.992 --> 00:41:41.995
Misdirected.

1202
00:41:41.995 --> 00:41:42.959
Misfiled.

1203
00:41:43.499 --> 00:41:45.728
<v ->Or, can it be simply cast aside</v>

1204
00:41:45.728 --> 00:41:47.254
because of the beliefs because of the waking hours?

1205
00:41:47.254 --> 00:41:49.004
<v ->Of course. Of course.</v>

1206
00:41:49.004 --> 00:41:49.792
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1207
00:41:49.792 --> 00:41:50.763
<v ->So, misunderstood.</v>

1208
00:41:50.763 --> 00:41:52.884
So, it's just went through you.

1209
00:41:52.884 --> 00:41:53.526
<v ->Yes.</v>

1210
00:41:53.526 --> 00:41:54.506
<v ->So, what I do,</v>

1211
00:41:54.506 --> 00:41:59.506
Once I locate you as a undefined point in space,

1212
00:42:00.735 --> 00:42:03.178
read the heat coming out of the body,

1213
00:42:03.178 --> 00:42:04.596
one-hundredth of a second of it,

1214
00:42:04.596 --> 00:42:06.655
my computers calculate it,

1215
00:42:06.655 --> 00:42:08.617
and within, like, 30 second,

1216
00:42:08.617 --> 00:42:13.524
I have a charts which check 20,000 items on you.

1217
00:42:13.524 --> 00:42:15.390
We look at the top 12,

1218
00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:17.139
and see what's going on,

1219
00:42:17.139 --> 00:42:18.323
And, uh....

1220
00:42:18.323 --> 00:42:22.493
And then we look at the energetic chart, spiritual chart,

1221
00:42:22.493 --> 00:42:24.896
stress chart, and...

1222
00:42:25.976 --> 00:42:27.796
Any other things that's important

1223
00:42:27.796 --> 00:42:29.550
to your body to tell us what's going on

1224
00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:31.018
with you at the moment.

1225
00:42:31.988 --> 00:42:33.390
And then, we send it to you,

1226
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:37.369
so you need to know what is really going on with you

1227
00:42:37.369 --> 00:42:39.357
at any time.

1228
00:42:39.357 --> 00:42:40.809
So we figure out three months,

1229
00:42:40.809 --> 00:42:43.784
it's a good time for you to work on yourself.

1230
00:42:43.784 --> 00:42:45.769
Every three months you get a new chart,

1231
00:42:45.769 --> 00:42:47.881
and you're gonna reinvigorate,

1232
00:42:47.881 --> 00:42:50.482
redo things, cleanse things, change things.

1233
00:42:50.482 --> 00:42:52.883
You have a time to do all these things.

1234
00:42:53.853 --> 00:42:56.050
Because, otherwise, you'll never know.

1235
00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:58.291
You're gonna be guessing all day long.

1236
00:42:58.291 --> 00:42:59.506
What's going on in your life,

1237
00:42:59.506 --> 00:43:00.039
who you are,

1238
00:43:00.039 --> 00:43:00.669
where you go,

1239
00:43:00.669 --> 00:43:02.707
who you wanna be.

1240
00:43:03.209 --> 00:43:04.221
And how you gonna do it?

1241
00:43:04.221 --> 00:43:06.098
<v ->And how's the validation with the person?</v>

1242
00:43:06.098 --> 00:43:07.047
How accurate--

1243
00:43:07.047 --> 00:43:08.902
<v ->Oh, 97% accuracy.</v>

1244
00:43:08.902 --> 00:43:09.821
We don't guess.

1245
00:43:09.821 --> 00:43:10.854
There's no guessing.

1246
00:43:10.854 --> 00:43:13.239
This is all math, you know, I mean...

1247
00:43:13.839 --> 00:43:15.292
<v ->And it's validated to the person?</v>

1248
00:43:15.292 --> 00:43:16.902
<v ->Yeah, the person knows everything,</v>

1249
00:43:16.902 --> 00:43:19.356
we tell them, yeah, yeah, yeah--

1250
00:43:19.356 --> 00:43:20.764
<v ->And what kind of things will it indicate</v>

1251
00:43:20.764 --> 00:43:21.777
that they would validate.

1252
00:43:21.777 --> 00:43:24.134
<v ->Every allergies,</v>

1253
00:43:24.134 --> 00:43:26.896
we can tell you the name of the parasite inside you

1254
00:43:26.896 --> 00:43:27.664
<v ->Mmm-huh.</v>

1255
00:43:27.664 --> 00:43:29.169
<v ->We very accurate,</v>

1256
00:43:29.169 --> 00:43:31.610
'cause a parasite is a frequency, too.

1257
00:43:32.411 --> 00:43:34.160
<v ->So, if it's there, we know it.</v>

1258
00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.208
And we know their name.

1259
00:43:36.208 --> 00:43:38.853
If you wash your hand with a soap

1260
00:43:38.853 --> 00:43:40.730
which is affecting you negatively.

1261
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:41.424
We know it's a chemical,

1262
00:43:42.424 --> 00:43:43.484
and we know the name of the chemical.

1263
00:43:43.484 --> 00:43:44.994
And if...

1264
00:43:44.994 --> 00:43:46.876
<v ->And it's, when you, when it...</v>

1265
00:43:46.876 --> 00:43:48.066
<v ->It will shows up!</v>

1266
00:43:48.066 --> 00:43:49.396
<v ->And people, it turns out...</v>

1267
00:43:49.396 --> 00:43:50.800
<v ->Yeah! It shows up!</v>

1268
00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:51.610
<v ->Interesting.</v>

1269
00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:52.680
<v ->Yeah. yeah.</v>

1270
00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:54.769
If you use a magnetic, for example,

1271
00:43:54.769 --> 00:43:56.099
you're asleep on a magnet.

1272
00:43:56.099 --> 00:43:56.815
After a week,

1273
00:43:56.815 --> 00:43:58.007
the magnetic isn't going to affect you negatively,

1274
00:43:58.007 --> 00:43:59.521
it will spin you on the right spin.

1275
00:43:59.521 --> 00:44:01.454
We would know that right way.

1276
00:44:02.344 --> 00:44:03.609
<v ->Interesting.</v>

1277
00:44:03.609 --> 00:44:05.764
<v ->Yeah, I mean, you know.</v>

1278
00:44:07.464 --> 00:44:10.424
If your spouse doesn't feel good.

1279
00:44:10.424 --> 00:44:12.964
Let's say he has a, um...

1280
00:44:13.794 --> 00:44:15.064
sexual problem,

1281
00:44:15.064 --> 00:44:16.815
will show up in your chart.

1282
00:44:17.485 --> 00:44:18.974
<v ->Because your fields are so intertwined.</v>

1283
00:44:18.974 --> 00:44:20.446
<v ->They're intertwined, yes.</v>

1284
00:44:20.446 --> 00:44:22.473
<v ->So, on your chart, you would carry his,</v>

1285
00:44:22.473 --> 00:44:23.891
and he may carry yours.

1286
00:44:23.891 --> 00:44:24.734
<v ->Uh-huh.</v>

1287
00:44:24.734 --> 00:44:26.013
<v ->Yeah, and information.</v>

1288
00:44:27.443 --> 00:44:29.737
We all share frequencies.

1289
00:44:29.737 --> 00:44:32.225
24 hours a day, 7 days week.

1290
00:44:32.225 --> 00:44:35.310
'Specially family-oriented in a grouping. Yeah.

1291
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:35.997
<v ->Yes.</v>

1292
00:44:35.997 --> 00:44:37.735
Well, then there's that common DNA

1293
00:44:37.735 --> 00:44:38.855
that is part of that signature

1294
00:44:38.855 --> 00:44:40.225
and everything else, too.

1295
00:44:40.225 --> 00:44:40.989
<v ->Yeah--</v>

1296
00:44:40.989 --> 00:44:43.772
<v ->You're tied for a reason, I suppose, you chose it.</v>

1297
00:44:43.772 --> 00:44:46.799
<v ->Yeah, it's a pure frequency.</v>

1298
00:44:48.688 --> 00:44:51.398
Remember the heat that I was talking about?

1299
00:44:51.398 --> 00:44:53.871
See, you can walk into his field,

1300
00:44:54.666 --> 00:44:57.110
and then you overwhelm his field.

1301
00:44:57.110 --> 00:44:59.176
That's what human do.

1302
00:44:59.916 --> 00:45:02.155
Some people are very negative.

1303
00:45:02.155 --> 00:45:04.554
They have a very negative field of energy

1304
00:45:04.554 --> 00:45:07.248
that they express,

1305
00:45:07.818 --> 00:45:09.542
and you can see them when they

1306
00:45:09.542 --> 00:45:10.633
walk down the street from you.

1307
00:45:11.647 --> 00:45:12.927
And they always have to stay away,

1308
00:45:12.927 --> 00:45:13.855
and say, wait a minute,

1309
00:45:13.855 --> 00:45:15.242
I'll let them pass me,

1310
00:45:15.242 --> 00:45:17.902
I don't wanna get into their field.

1311
00:45:17.902 --> 00:45:21.064
Yeah, it's very common occurence, you know?

1312
00:45:21.064 --> 00:45:22.985
These people dump on other people.

1313
00:45:22.985 --> 00:45:24.800
<v ->And this comes up in charts that you see?</v>

1314
00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:27.347
<v ->All this come on charts. Yes.</v>

1315
00:45:27.347 --> 00:45:30.494
For them, and for other people who are the receiver.

1316
00:45:30.494 --> 00:45:31.795
There's more people who

1317
00:45:31.795 --> 00:45:33.790
receive negativity from other people.

1318
00:45:34.403 --> 00:45:35.827
From other sick people.

1319
00:45:35.827 --> 00:45:38.694
You know, dying is not a virtue.

1320
00:45:39.454 --> 00:45:40.455
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1321
00:45:41.235 --> 00:45:44.362
<v ->And so, therefore, you don't...</v>

1322
00:45:45.127 --> 00:45:46.469
You're nice to people who die.

1323
00:45:46.469 --> 00:45:48.421
Be nice to them, but you don't have

1324
00:45:48.421 --> 00:45:50.405
to think this is it, you know?

1325
00:45:50.405 --> 00:45:52.068
You know, you need to protect yourself.

1326
00:45:52.068 --> 00:45:54.703
You need to be strong for yourself, you know?

1327
00:45:54.703 --> 00:45:57.910
It's not okay to be sick because somebody else is sick.

1328
00:45:58.530 --> 00:45:59.843
<v ->And how many people do that?</v>

1329
00:45:59.843 --> 00:46:01.784
<v ->Yeah. A lot.</v>

1330
00:46:02.251 --> 00:46:05.977
And also, your pet may affect you negatively.

1331
00:46:05.977 --> 00:46:10.589
Most pets die with the same disease as their owner.

1332
00:46:11.608 --> 00:46:12.536
And they die fast,

1333
00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:14.872
like within seven years they die,

1334
00:46:14.872 --> 00:46:18.401
and then the owner get, the next day, get another new pet.

1335
00:46:19.331 --> 00:46:21.262
So, they suck...

1336
00:46:21.822 --> 00:46:25.292
they absolutely imitate the frequencies of the owners.

1337
00:46:25.292 --> 00:46:27.779
Yeah, but it sometimes works the other way, too.

1338
00:46:28.469 --> 00:46:30.354
<v ->Well, let's talk about how you came up with</v>

1339
00:46:30.354 --> 00:46:33.629
this system's kind of mathematical signature.

1340
00:46:34.819 --> 00:46:38.386
<v ->Uh, well, throughout the years,</v>

1341
00:46:38.386 --> 00:46:40.497
like in the '30s and the '40s,

1342
00:46:40.497 --> 00:46:42.272
was a lot of quantum physicists

1343
00:46:42.272 --> 00:46:45.309
who wrote books on this subject.

1344
00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:47.217
You know, we know, it used to be called

1345
00:46:47.217 --> 00:46:49.373
radionics in general theme of it.

1346
00:46:49.373 --> 00:46:50.183
<v ->Yes.</v>

1347
00:46:51.323 --> 00:46:54.505
<v ->And, uh. they took it out of, um...</v>

1348
00:46:55.606 --> 00:46:57.738
They make it illegal,

1349
00:46:57.738 --> 00:46:59.583
because the people who used it then...

1350
00:47:00.953 --> 00:47:05.231
claimed healing abilities and all this kinda stuff.

1351
00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:07.093
<v ->Well, they used it with pendulums</v>

1352
00:47:07.093 --> 00:47:08.148
and a lot of different things to

1353
00:47:08.148 --> 00:47:11.246
divine information of an energetic nature.

1354
00:47:11.465 --> 00:47:12.736
<v ->That's right.</v>

1355
00:47:12.736 --> 00:47:14.783
But mainly, the establishment,

1356
00:47:14.783 --> 00:47:17.609
the medical establishment, got scared,

1357
00:47:17.609 --> 00:47:20.574
and said, "Oh, no, no. Nobody can do healing anymore."

1358
00:47:22.104 --> 00:47:23.326
So, they took it out,

1359
00:47:23.326 --> 00:47:26.142
and they really persecuted everybody who worked

1360
00:47:26.142 --> 00:47:29.986
with the radionics for many, many years.

1361
00:47:30.099 --> 00:47:33.805
Rife and radionics, those two, I think, interconnected.

1362
00:47:34.802 --> 00:47:37.177
And, um, so my work...

1363
00:47:37.597 --> 00:47:39.672
I have nothing to do with radionics,

1364
00:47:39.672 --> 00:47:40.742
I don't do any.

1365
00:47:40.742 --> 00:47:42.898
So, I changed the whole system.

1366
00:47:42.898 --> 00:47:46.751
Now, I use only mathematics to come to the same result,

1367
00:47:46.751 --> 00:47:49.575
but my results are so superior, now.

1368
00:47:49.575 --> 00:47:51.473
It's just stunning.

1369
00:47:51.473 --> 00:47:53.095
It's mind-boggling, you know?

1370
00:47:53.095 --> 00:47:54.279
<v ->What makes the difference? Why?</v>

1371
00:47:54.279 --> 00:47:55.516
<v ->My hair stand up.</v>

1372
00:47:55.516 --> 00:47:56.774
Its accuracy.

1373
00:47:56.774 --> 00:47:59.312
Because, mathematically,

1374
00:47:59.312 --> 00:48:02.597
we cannot make mistakes in identifying you,

1375
00:48:02.597 --> 00:48:05.668
and also, with identifying your frequencies.

1376
00:48:06.618 --> 00:48:08.143
We don't.

1377
00:48:08.143 --> 00:48:11.989
And so, that's a big advantage for me.

1378
00:48:12.368 --> 00:48:14.639
And, remember: the key here,

1379
00:48:14.639 --> 00:48:16.591
not only to look at what you have,

1380
00:48:16.591 --> 00:48:20.495
to send you the correct frequency back to your higher self,

1381
00:48:20.495 --> 00:48:23.620
for your body to heal itself, to balance.

1382
00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:25.455
<v ->Okay, what's that part of the equation?</v>

1383
00:48:25.455 --> 00:48:26.511
How does that work?

1384
00:48:26.511 --> 00:48:29.050
So, I mean, I assume you do this assessment,

1385
00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:30.275
a person can tell

1386
00:48:30.275 --> 00:48:32.142
where their life force is at, more or less.

1387
00:48:32.142 --> 00:48:33.486
Well, accurately, yes.

1388
00:48:33.486 --> 00:48:35.241
<v ->This is one thing.</v>

1389
00:48:35.241 --> 00:48:35.907
<v ->But what happens after that?</v>

1390
00:48:35.907 --> 00:48:40.407
<v ->The purpose is that this whole program that I have</v>

1391
00:48:40.407 --> 00:48:43.718
is to help you raise your life force,

1392
00:48:43.718 --> 00:48:46.381
and balance energies within your body.

1393
00:48:46.381 --> 00:48:50.537
If I know what's the imbalance frequency is,

1394
00:48:50.537 --> 00:48:53.774
I can resend it to you as a message,

1395
00:48:53.774 --> 00:48:55.863
as an information back.

1396
00:48:56.133 --> 00:48:58.092
<v ->See, you're sending me, me, me,</v>

1397
00:48:58.092 --> 00:48:59.843
I'm sending you, oh, yeah, that's you.

1398
00:48:59.843 --> 00:49:01.164
I'm gonna send it back to you.

1399
00:49:01.164 --> 00:49:03.859
So, now you pay attention what you want.

1400
00:49:05.259 --> 00:49:09.387
So, you're receiving back what you want to work on.

1401
00:49:10.742 --> 00:49:12.716
See? And that's the beauty here.

1402
00:49:12.716 --> 00:49:15.094
You don't really have to go guess and just figure out:

1403
00:49:15.094 --> 00:49:16.577
What's wrong with me?

1404
00:49:16.577 --> 00:49:18.166
You're getting it back.

1405
00:49:18.166 --> 00:49:20.663
Just allow your body to heal.

1406
00:49:20.663 --> 00:49:21.922
Give it the chance.

1407
00:49:21.922 --> 00:49:24.166
Give it the opportunity.

1408
00:49:24.166 --> 00:49:25.944
And be nice to yourself.

1409
00:49:25.944 --> 00:49:28.459
<v ->And, now, this in audio form?</v>

1410
00:49:28.459 --> 00:49:29.589
<v ->Some of it.</v>

1411
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:31.969
Only the first part is audio.

1412
00:49:31.969 --> 00:49:33.578
When you get your evaluation,

1413
00:49:33.578 --> 00:49:35.976
there is a 48 hours, uh...

1414
00:49:37.526 --> 00:49:40.146
sound frequency attachment to it.

1415
00:49:40.751 --> 00:49:43.672
But, once you're on my program,

1416
00:49:43.672 --> 00:49:44.877
you really don't need it,

1417
00:49:44.877 --> 00:49:47.662
because we balance you 24 hours a day,

1418
00:49:47.662 --> 00:49:48.717
7 days a week,

1419
00:49:48.717 --> 00:49:50.520
no matter where you are,

1420
00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.109
no matter who you are,

1421
00:49:52.109 --> 00:49:54.981
time and space is irrelevant in this equation.

1422
00:49:55.361 --> 00:49:56.333
<v ->Mmm-huh.</v>

1423
00:49:56.333 --> 00:49:58.778
Yeah. So, it's amazing.

1424
00:49:59.138 --> 00:50:01.775
<v ->And what's being sent back is</v>

1425
00:50:01.775 --> 00:50:04.413
frequencies carried in the mathematics?

1426
00:50:04.631 --> 00:50:06.700
<v ->Right. But it's resonance frequencies.</v>

1427
00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:07.212
<v ->Yes.</v>

1428
00:50:07.212 --> 00:50:08.151
<v ->That's that's what they call it.</v>

1429
00:50:08.151 --> 00:50:09.878
<v ->And explain what resonance frequence are--</v>

1430
00:50:09.878 --> 00:50:12.178
<v ->Well, resonance frequencies</v>

1431
00:50:12.178 --> 00:50:14.990
are the most common frequencies

1432
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:16.587
for human to communicate with

1433
00:50:16.587 --> 00:50:18.646
between one each other,

1434
00:50:18.646 --> 00:50:19.841
and through the world.

1435
00:50:19.841 --> 00:50:21.590
This is the most common one.

1436
00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:23.605
And they're very basic, you know.

1437
00:50:23.605 --> 00:50:25.046
It's heat.

1438
00:50:25.046 --> 00:50:26.912
And we need to remember, also,

1439
00:50:26.912 --> 00:50:28.277
something very important:

1440
00:50:28.277 --> 00:50:30.837
remember, we always talk about energies.

1441
00:50:30.837 --> 00:50:32.883
Energy this and energy that.

1442
00:50:32.883 --> 00:50:35.103
Energy carries information.

1443
00:50:35.103 --> 00:50:36.028
<v ->Yes.</v>

1444
00:50:36.028 --> 00:50:38.300
<v ->The job of energy is to carry information.</v>

1445
00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:39.711
Only.

1446
00:50:39.711 --> 00:50:40.901
There is nothing...

1447
00:50:40.901 --> 00:50:43.026
There's no other function to the energy

1448
00:50:43.026 --> 00:50:44.789
other than carrying information.

1449
00:50:45.483 --> 00:50:50.367
So, most people think that their energy

1450
00:50:50.367 --> 00:50:51.359
is what's fixing them.

1451
00:50:51.359 --> 00:50:53.759
No, the information is the one that you need

1452
00:50:53.759 --> 00:50:56.238
to correct whatever is going on in your body.

1453
00:50:56.575 --> 00:50:58.473
So, the information about this fungus.

1454
00:50:58.473 --> 00:51:00.788
Information about this allergy.

1455
00:51:00.788 --> 00:51:03.284
The information about this particular chemical

1456
00:51:03.284 --> 00:51:05.140
that's inside your body, is sitting.

1457
00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:09.651
It's the information about the food you ate that hurt you.

1458
00:51:09.651 --> 00:51:14.632
These are the things that we really need to know.

1459
00:51:14.632 --> 00:51:16.872
<v ->So, these are frequencies?</v>

1460
00:51:16.872 --> 00:51:17.640
<v ->It's all frequencies!</v>

1461
00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:18.515
<v ->Resonance frequencies,</v>

1462
00:51:18.515 --> 00:51:21.276
which are essentially delivered back to you

1463
00:51:21.276 --> 00:51:22.717
as a numeric value.

1464
00:51:22.717 --> 00:51:24.168
<v ->As a numeric value. Yeah.</v>

1465
00:51:24.168 --> 00:51:25.362
But they come to you...

1466
00:51:25.362 --> 00:51:29.163
Everything send numerically because it's computerized.

1467
00:51:29.163 --> 00:51:31.248
But, don't ever forget...

1468
00:51:32.748 --> 00:51:34.409
Don't ever forget...

1469
00:51:34.409 --> 00:51:36.471
That we are computerized.

1470
00:51:36.471 --> 00:51:38.151
<v ->Yes. Biological computers.</v>

1471
00:51:38.151 --> 00:51:39.345
<v ->We are biological computer.</v>

1472
00:51:39.345 --> 00:51:40.648
We are the most advanced.

1473
00:51:40.648 --> 00:51:43.139
So, we use math all the time.

1474
00:51:44.649 --> 00:51:45.958
That's all we do, we use math.

1475
00:51:45.958 --> 00:51:47.729
We just not aware of it,

1476
00:51:47.729 --> 00:51:50.011
we use math to do... to live!

1477
00:51:50.011 --> 00:51:51.878
<v ->Well, we have done an interview</v>

1478
00:51:51.878 --> 00:51:54.307
with another man named Roy Mears

1479
00:51:54.307 --> 00:51:57.369
who's working just with the numeric value also,

1480
00:51:57.369 --> 00:51:59.270
in a different way entirely,

1481
00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:02.203
but again, of these frequencies.

1482
00:52:03.263 --> 00:52:05.990
Math. Frequencies. Healing.

1483
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.597
<v ->Yep.</v>

1484
00:52:06.597 --> 00:52:09.136
<v ->Giving the body the information that it needs.</v>

1485
00:52:09.136 --> 00:52:09.786
<v ->Yep.</v>

1486
00:52:09.786 --> 00:52:12.837
<v ->And this is done, it's more kind of,</v>

1487
00:52:12.837 --> 00:52:15.525
if they're on your program, it's done more automatically?

1488
00:52:15.525 --> 00:52:16.582
<v ->It's all automatic.</v>

1489
00:52:16.582 --> 00:52:17.263
Yeah.

1490
00:52:17.263 --> 00:52:20.105
Once you sign up for a year or for the lifetime,

1491
00:52:20.105 --> 00:52:22.015
you're with us forever.

1492
00:52:22.475 --> 00:52:24.010
You know, I mean, I'm planning to live forever,

1493
00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:26.702
so I will welcome everybody to be with me.

1494
00:52:26.702 --> 00:52:28.000
<v ->Forever!</v>

1495
00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:29.859
<v ->Once they read my book,</v>

1496
00:52:29.859 --> 00:52:31.480
they say, okay, I'm here sign me in.

1497
00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.592
<v ->So, they have contact with you during this process?</v>

1498
00:52:35.242 --> 00:52:36.737
<v ->Yeah. Every three months.</v>

1499
00:52:36.737 --> 00:52:38.796
Well, listen, if somebody is sick,

1500
00:52:38.796 --> 00:52:40.033
send me an email,

1501
00:52:40.033 --> 00:52:43.324
I'll check you again and send you a new evaluation.

1502
00:52:43.324 --> 00:52:45.249
Yeah, I always do that.

1503
00:52:45.249 --> 00:52:46.273
<v ->Otherwise, it's every three months?</v>

1504
00:52:46.273 --> 00:52:46.923
<v ->Every three months.</v>

1505
00:52:46.923 --> 00:52:49.289
<v ->And then, what is sending the information?</v>

1506
00:52:49.289 --> 00:52:51.360
<v ->My server. I have a big server--</v>

1507
00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:52.192
<v ->Oh, I see.</v>

1508
00:52:53.251 --> 00:52:56.107
<v ->And it's very safe,</v>

1509
00:52:56.107 --> 00:52:59.381
and it's different places around the world

1510
00:52:59.381 --> 00:53:02.005
so if one failed, the other one's still working.

1511
00:53:02.005 --> 00:53:03.029
<v ->Yes.</v>

1512
00:53:03.029 --> 00:53:05.215
<v ->I mean, I made it very safe. It's like a bank.</v>

1513
00:53:05.215 --> 00:53:06.335
<v ->Yes.</v>

1514
00:53:06.893 --> 00:53:08.906
<v ->And that's distributing the information?</v>

1515
00:53:08.906 --> 00:53:10.346
<v ->Yes. It does all the calculations.</v>

1516
00:53:10.346 --> 00:53:11.654
Distributing the information.

1517
00:53:11.654 --> 00:53:13.824
It's very, very private and secure.

1518
00:53:13.824 --> 00:53:15.063
<v ->How does it serve it?</v>

1519
00:53:15.063 --> 00:53:16.991
Via a file that you open?

1520
00:53:16.991 --> 00:53:19.248
<v ->Yeah. Yes, I open a file.</v>

1521
00:53:19.248 --> 00:53:20.978
Each person is a file.

1522
00:53:20.978 --> 00:53:23.474
There is no limit in the amount of people that I can have.

1523
00:53:24.071 --> 00:53:25.789
And just the speed of the server,

1524
00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:28.722
and the information that we have there,

1525
00:53:28.722 --> 00:53:31.058
and we update it all the time anyway.

1526
00:53:31.666 --> 00:53:33.453
You know, there's new frequencies that I find

1527
00:53:33.453 --> 00:53:35.703
all the time and I update constantly.

1528
00:53:36.503 --> 00:53:37.937
Like, recently, we updated,

1529
00:53:37.937 --> 00:53:40.071
you know, we had so much more,

1530
00:53:40.071 --> 00:53:41.777
and it is just amazing.

1531
00:53:42.427 --> 00:53:44.966
<v ->'Cause a lot's changing on the frequency level out there.</v>

1532
00:53:44.966 --> 00:53:46.673
Is it expensive for people to do?

1533
00:53:46.673 --> 00:53:47.543
<v ->No!</v>

1534
00:53:47.543 --> 00:53:48.251
Actually not.

1535
00:53:48.251 --> 00:53:50.331
<v ->I charge 600 for the year,</v>

1536
00:53:50.331 --> 00:53:51.547
which is $2 a day.

1537
00:53:51.547 --> 00:53:53.189
Cheaper than a cup of coffee.

1538
00:53:53.189 --> 00:53:54.191
<v ->Yeah. Absolutely.</v>

1539
00:53:54.191 --> 00:53:55.492
Actually, it'd be a little less than $2..

1540
00:53:57.115 --> 00:54:01.039
<v ->And for the lifetime, it's $2,875.</v>

1541
00:54:01.039 --> 00:54:02.565
For the lifetime.

1542
00:54:02.565 --> 00:54:05.360
Regardless how long you want to live.

1543
00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:06.618
Or you will live.

1544
00:54:06.876 --> 00:54:08.246
Cause we gonna be here.

1545
00:54:08.246 --> 00:54:10.180
<v ->As long as the grid doesn't go down--</v>

1546
00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:12.057
<v ->Nothing gonna happen.</v>

1547
00:54:12.057 --> 00:54:14.010
That's another story about the 2-12, you know?

1548
00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:15.010
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1549
00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:16.862
<v ->Yeah. It's all about you.</v>

1550
00:54:17.452 --> 00:54:19.155
It's has nothing to do with anybody else.

1551
00:54:19.775 --> 00:54:21.132
<v ->Mmm-huh. I getcha.</v>

1552
00:54:21.132 --> 00:54:23.365
Well, this is, it's very intriguing.

1553
00:54:23.365 --> 00:54:25.321
All of the background information, too,

1554
00:54:25.321 --> 00:54:26.600
in terms of what we're doing to,

1555
00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:28.147
essentially, to poison ourselves,

1556
00:54:28.147 --> 00:54:30.365
and rob ourselves of our life force.

1557
00:54:30.365 --> 00:54:31.517
So, you're saying...

1558
00:54:31.517 --> 00:54:33.416
I mean, there are things we can do,

1559
00:54:33.416 --> 00:54:35.720
like you say: don't eat those foods.

1560
00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.982
Um, you know, breathe.

1561
00:54:37.982 --> 00:54:40.104
Get out in the sun, at least two minutes a day, anyway,

1562
00:54:40.104 --> 00:54:41.779
just get a little touch of sunshine,

1563
00:54:41.779 --> 00:54:43.817
and that communication going,

1564
00:54:43.817 --> 00:54:45.235
that information going,

1565
00:54:45.235 --> 00:54:47.741
and then, to take it a step further,

1566
00:54:47.741 --> 00:54:49.937
is to go into something like your speaking of,

1567
00:54:49.937 --> 00:54:51.703
about these frequencies with this numeric,

1568
00:54:51.703 --> 00:54:53.533
as a numeric with these frequencies,

1569
00:54:53.533 --> 00:54:56.742
that can be operating in the background, more or less.

1570
00:54:56.742 --> 00:54:58.385
<v ->It's all the time.</v>

1571
00:54:58.385 --> 00:55:00.317
Metaphorically, it's like you have an angel

1572
00:55:00.317 --> 00:55:02.599
above you with your name on it.

1573
00:55:02.599 --> 00:55:04.681
24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

1574
00:55:04.681 --> 00:55:06.831
Never leave you alone.

1575
00:55:07.431 --> 00:55:08.796
<v ->Do people notice a difference--</v>

1576
00:55:08.796 --> 00:55:09.330
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1577
00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:11.480
<v ->They must. You wouldn't be doing it, I would assume...</v>

1578
00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:15.244
I get the response from people, like, unbelievable.

1579
00:55:15.944 --> 00:55:17.863
You know, change their life.

1580
00:55:17.863 --> 00:55:19.305
Some people start right away.

1581
00:55:19.305 --> 00:55:20.935
Sometimes takes them takes longer.

1582
00:55:20.935 --> 00:55:23.004
It depends how your life is.

1583
00:55:23.004 --> 00:55:25.830
What you're accustomed to, you know.

1584
00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:27.217
Some people wanna switch right away,

1585
00:55:27.217 --> 00:55:28.699
they have no time, you know?

1586
00:55:28.699 --> 00:55:30.544
But some people take two, three years,

1587
00:55:30.544 --> 00:55:31.972
and then suddenly say,

1588
00:55:31.972 --> 00:55:34.596
"Oh, my god, what was I doing?"

1589
00:55:36.246 --> 00:55:38.837
<v ->The way you choose to live also would</v>

1590
00:55:38.837 --> 00:55:43.291
help address the subject, or the trait of, impatience.

1591
00:55:43.291 --> 00:55:44.266
<v ->Oh, yeah!</v>

1592
00:55:44.266 --> 00:55:45.512
<v ->Because you have forever.</v>

1593
00:55:45.512 --> 00:55:47.077
Because, that's my bad trait.

1594
00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:48.869
I tend to wanna just go.

1595
00:55:48.869 --> 00:55:50.575
I don't like impediments,

1596
00:55:50.575 --> 00:55:52.079
and I tend to be impatient.

1597
00:55:52.079 --> 00:55:54.127
And, I know that's not a good thing, so--

1598
00:55:54.127 --> 00:55:55.491
<v ->I'll tell you one more thing.</v>

1599
00:55:56.068 --> 00:55:57.572
You know, many people think,

1600
00:55:57.572 --> 00:55:59.782
that live in this world, in this culture, think,

1601
00:55:59.782 --> 00:56:01.168
they don't have time!

1602
00:56:01.168 --> 00:56:02.352
They're always: I don't have time!

1603
00:56:02.352 --> 00:56:03.413
<v ->Run, run, run!</v>

1604
00:56:03.413 --> 00:56:04.697
<v ->Every other word, say, I don't have time.</v>

1605
00:56:04.697 --> 00:56:06.606
You cannot stay that anymore,

1606
00:56:06.606 --> 00:56:07.908
because the word,

1607
00:56:07.908 --> 00:56:09.668
I do not have time,

1608
00:56:09.668 --> 00:56:12.579
literally translated by your subconcious is,

1609
00:56:12.579 --> 00:56:14.041
you wanna die.

1610
00:56:14.041 --> 00:56:14.831
<v ->Oops.</v>

1611
00:56:14.831 --> 00:56:18.253
<v ->Yeah. And my system, uh...</v>

1612
00:56:18.253 --> 00:56:20.254
flag it right away.

1613
00:56:20.834 --> 00:56:23.595
And, it's, oh my god, then I know what the story and--

1614
00:56:23.595 --> 00:56:24.835
<v ->Well, if you were evaluating me,</v>

1615
00:56:24.835 --> 00:56:26.424
I think that'd come up number one.

1616
00:56:27.964 --> 00:56:29.017
Running, running.

1617
00:56:29.017 --> 00:56:29.901
And there's no real reason to,

1618
00:56:29.901 --> 00:56:30.830
everything always gets done.

1619
00:56:30.830 --> 00:56:31.544
<v ->Oh, totally.</v>

1620
00:56:31.544 --> 00:56:32.601
And I wanna tell you something.

1621
00:56:32.601 --> 00:56:35.736
There is another thing that's something really interesting.

1622
00:56:35.736 --> 00:56:37.688
Living in a dark room.

1623
00:56:37.688 --> 00:56:38.765
For a long period of time.

1624
00:56:38.765 --> 00:56:39.778
For weeks.

1625
00:56:39.778 --> 00:56:41.282
In the dark place.

1626
00:56:41.282 --> 00:56:43.322
That's a whole new subject.

1627
00:56:45.532 --> 00:56:46.342
<v ->We'll have to do...</v>

1628
00:56:46.342 --> 00:56:47.062
We're out of tape.

1629
00:56:47.062 --> 00:56:49.260
We are gonna have to do that next time,

1630
00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:50.966
because now you've left us with a cliff-hanger,

1631
00:56:50.966 --> 00:56:52.492
is that a bad thing,

1632
00:56:52.492 --> 00:56:53.814
or is that a good thing?

1633
00:56:53.814 --> 00:56:56.107
Don't tell us. We'll visit again.

1634
00:56:56.107 --> 00:56:58.998
I love your energy and your information,

1635
00:56:58.998 --> 00:57:01.153
so, until next time,

1636
00:57:01.153 --> 00:57:02.136
thank you so much, Mony.

1637
00:57:02.136 --> 00:57:03.183
Thank you.

1638
00:57:05.246 --> 00:57:06.228
I don't know Mony's age,

1639
00:57:06.228 --> 00:57:08.394
but he certainly radiates vibrant health.

1640
00:57:08.394 --> 00:57:11.146
One of his other secrets is doing 25 minutes a day

1641
00:57:11.146 --> 00:57:12.459
on a mini trampoline,

1642
00:57:12.459 --> 00:57:15.453
which he says strengthens bones, dumps toxins,

1643
00:57:15.453 --> 00:57:17.621
and tones the entire body and the organs.

1644
00:57:17.621 --> 00:57:19.104
I'm gonna give it a try myself.

1645
00:57:19.104 --> 00:57:20.149
To see more of his work,

1646
00:57:20.149 --> 00:57:22.743
you can go to physicalimmortality.net.

1647
00:57:22.743 --> 00:57:25.539
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
