00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:02.209
<v ->They call him Amazon John.</v>

2
00:00:02.209 --> 00:00:04.029
More than three decades ago,

3
00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:06.409
looking for hidden treasure along the Amazon,

4
00:00:06.409 --> 00:00:07.969
Indiana Jones style,

5
00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:10.579
John Easterling found treasures beyond the price

6
00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:12.689
of gold and riches he was looking for.

7
00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:15.649
The fruits, herbs, and roots of the rain forest.

8
00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:18.179
He later founded Amazon Herb Company,

9
00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:20.329
which leaders in the world of economics,

10
00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:22.809
as well as consumers and indigenous tribes,

11
00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:26.349
are heralding as a model of economic sustainability.

12
00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.069
But what still gets Amazon John's passions going

13
00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:32.409
after 300 plus trips to the Amazon,

14
00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.529
are the constantly evolving possibilities

15
00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:37.719
of how these nutrient-dense products of the rain forest

16
00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.174
can change the quality of our lives.

17
00:00:42.663 --> 00:00:44.844 line:15% 
(mystical music)

18
00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:49.778
<v Regina>Let's talk about your personal story,</v>

19
00:00:49.778 --> 00:00:53.351
the voyage that took you treasure hunting to begin with.

20
00:00:53.351 --> 00:00:56.642
And how you began first understanding

21
00:00:56.642 --> 00:00:58.941
the beauty and value of these incredible plants

22
00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:00.424
of the Amazon.

23
00:01:00.424 --> 00:01:02.887
Because you had a tough story, you became ill.

24
00:01:02.887 --> 00:01:07.047
<v ->Yeah I did and it really started before the plants.</v>

25
00:01:07.047 --> 00:01:09.276
I mean the story really began with an interest

26
00:01:09.276 --> 00:01:13.308
in Peru and Bolivia and the highlands and the Inca cultures

27
00:01:13.308 --> 00:01:15.100
when I was in grade school.

28
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.862
So it's kind of a dream deferred for many years.

29
00:01:17.862 --> 00:01:19.522
And when I got done with college,

30
00:01:19.522 --> 00:01:21.900
I sold my car and bought a ticket to Ecuador.

31
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.479
And that's how it all went down, really,

32
00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.783
looking for lost cities of gold and Inca treasure.

33
00:01:25.783 --> 00:01:27.069
So, essentially, I was a treasure hunter.

34
00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:29.357
<v Regina>Indiana Jones.</v>
<v ->That was it, you know,</v>

35
00:01:29.357 --> 00:01:30.484
I'd seen the stories.

36
00:01:30.484 --> 00:01:31.576
I knew there was lost cities,

37
00:01:31.576 --> 00:01:33.154
I knew there was gold down there.

38
00:01:33.154 --> 00:01:36.130
And I didn't have any money, so I sold my car.

39
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.363
Gave me just enough money for a round trip ticket

40
00:01:38.363 --> 00:01:40.392
with a couple hundred bucks left over.

41
00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:42.206
So off I went.

42
00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:43.646
And after being down a couple weeks,

43
00:01:43.646 --> 00:01:45.898
I hadn't really found a whole lot of lost cities,

44
00:01:45.898 --> 00:01:48.777
or any treasure or gold.

45
00:01:48.777 --> 00:01:51.563
So I just bought some handicrafts and brought those back.

46
00:01:51.563 --> 00:01:53.819
I was able to sell that to buy another ticket.

47
00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.803
So I knew the system was gonna work after all. (chuckles)

48
00:01:56.803 --> 00:02:00.790
So I continue going down, developing a trade

49
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.280
in artesanias items, and then later,

50
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.584
in a lot of gemstones out of Brazil.

51
00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:09.016
And then started spending more time in the jungle

52
00:02:09.016 --> 00:02:12.919
with tribal artifacts and blow guns and ceramics

53
00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.871
and textiles and this sort of thing.

54
00:02:14.871 --> 00:02:16.575
And so I developed relationships

55
00:02:16.575 --> 00:02:18.378
with a variety of indigenous communities,

56
00:02:18.378 --> 00:02:23.006
with Shipibo, and Ashaninka, Machiguenga Indians.

57
00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:25.499
But you're right, I had a very serious health challenge.

58
00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:27.186
In fact, I had a near death experience

59
00:02:27.186 --> 00:02:28.518
in a hospital in North Carolina,

60
00:02:28.518 --> 00:02:30.854
with hepatitus and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever

61
00:02:30.854 --> 00:02:33.158
when I was about 22 years old.

62
00:02:33.158 --> 00:02:36.176
That left me in a very compromised state of health

63
00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:38.032
where I fatigue very easily.

64
00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:40.560
The mental acuity wasn't there.

65
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.864
You know, the liver performs like 900 different functions,

66
00:02:42.864 --> 00:02:45.470
so there was just a real severe compromise

67
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.945
that I would get so tired, I'd just have to lay down

68
00:02:48.945 --> 00:02:52.411
for a few hours and kind of break out

69
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:54.033
to get a little sweat going.

70
00:02:54.033 --> 00:02:56.582
And then I'd be okay for another week or two.

71
00:02:56.582 --> 00:02:58.587
So this happened in the jungle in Peru.

72
00:02:58.587 --> 00:03:00.801
And some indigenous people brought me

73
00:03:00.801 --> 00:03:02.113
a variety of herbs.

74
00:03:02.113 --> 00:03:03.181
They just brewed up some tea,

75
00:03:03.181 --> 00:03:05.272
Una De Gato, Chanca Piedra,

76
00:03:05.272 --> 00:03:06.498
and brought it to me.

77
00:03:06.498 --> 00:03:08.098
And I drank it.

78
00:03:08.098 --> 00:03:09.330
Like I would drink pretty much

79
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.866
anything they handed me.

80
00:03:10.866 --> 00:03:13.885
But I really had no expectations of anything happening.

81
00:03:13.885 --> 00:03:16.252
But things did start happening.

82
00:03:16.252 --> 00:03:18.174
After a few days I noticed that

83
00:03:18.174 --> 00:03:22.658
I was feeling a little stronger, I was feeling better,

84
00:03:22.658 --> 00:03:24.941
my mind was getting sharper.

85
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:27.607
And at the end of about a week, ten days,

86
00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:30.647
I recognized that I feel as good as I felt

87
00:03:30.647 --> 00:03:32.503
before I was sick.

88
00:03:32.503 --> 00:03:35.105
Not even as good as I felt before I was sick.

89
00:03:35.105 --> 00:03:37.249
I was feeling better and I took my health

90
00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:39.148
to a whole new place.

91
00:03:39.148 --> 00:03:41.868
Into what I call a new level of life experience.

92
00:03:41.868 --> 00:03:43.081
Where the mental acuity is there,

93
00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:45.581
the sense of groundedness, the energy flow,

94
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:48.785
you know, that natural vibration

95
00:03:48.785 --> 00:03:50.835
and vitality that we have,

96
00:03:50.835 --> 00:03:53.224
I felt at home in my immediate environment.

97
00:03:53.224 --> 00:03:55.869
So I was really connecting with my surroundings

98
00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:58.472
and the universe in a whole different way.

99
00:03:58.472 --> 00:04:01.393
So I recognized then, gee, all these years

100
00:04:01.393 --> 00:04:03.980
I've been coming down, chopping this stuff down

101
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.262
looking for treasure, that the real treasure,

102
00:04:06.262 --> 00:04:09.309
in fact, is in over 200,000 species

103
00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:11.485
growing in the Amazon.

104
00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:13.074
<v Regina>So what happened from that point?</v>

105
00:04:13.074 --> 00:04:14.835
Once you made that discovery,

106
00:04:14.835 --> 00:04:16.883
obviously it's been a journey,

107
00:04:16.883 --> 00:04:19.826
and a long journey, to get where you are today.

108
00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:21.592
What was your next step, once you realized,

109
00:04:21.592 --> 00:04:24.888
"Aha! The gold is in the leaves, in the vines"?

110
00:04:24.888 --> 00:04:27.811
<v ->Well yeah, it was very important to me</v>

111
00:04:27.811 --> 00:04:29.664
and I still didn't recognize it

112
00:04:29.664 --> 00:04:32.014
as something to share with the rest of the world.

113
00:04:32.014 --> 00:04:34.030
I recognized very valuable for me, you know,

114
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.051
I was maintaining a stash, if you will, of these herbs.

115
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:41.599
During this same time, I met a lady, Nicole Maxwell.

116
00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:44.756
She had been introduced to me by a wildlife photographer

117
00:04:44.756 --> 00:04:47.038
that spent a lot of time in South America.

118
00:04:47.038 --> 00:04:50.804
And Nicole was a great pioneer.

119
00:04:50.804 --> 00:04:53.491
She wrote a book early on,

120
00:04:53.491 --> 00:04:56.840
called Witch Doctor's Apprentice in 1961.

121
00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.797
And she spent a lot of time in Bolivia

122
00:04:59.797 --> 00:05:04.469
as kind of a chain-smoking, gun-toting wild woman.

123
00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:06.926
This is back in the fifties.

124
00:05:06.926 --> 00:05:09.654
And she had an experience where

125
00:05:09.654 --> 00:05:11.878
she was in the jungle doing a story,

126
00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:15.484
and she was cut with a machete and bleeding heavily.

127
00:05:15.484 --> 00:05:19.556
And some of the indigenous people around Iquitos

128
00:05:19.556 --> 00:05:22.926
had saved her life with Sangre de Drago,

129
00:05:22.926 --> 00:05:23.759
the sap from a tree.

130
00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:26.222
They cut this tree, it bleeds the sap,

131
00:05:26.222 --> 00:05:28.526
and put it in the wound and it healed,

132
00:05:28.526 --> 00:05:29.946
and it saved her life.

133
00:05:29.946 --> 00:05:33.914
And so, she got very interested in herbs and botanicals,

134
00:05:33.914 --> 00:05:36.057
and spent the next 30 years of her life

135
00:05:36.057 --> 00:05:38.095
studying herbs.

136
00:05:38.095 --> 00:05:39.076
And I ran into her,

137
00:05:39.076 --> 00:05:40.324
and she was sharing her story,

138
00:05:40.324 --> 00:05:41.881
and I was sharing my story,

139
00:05:41.881 --> 00:05:44.249
and that's when it really, kind of, clicked

140
00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:47.523
that these things really are substantial treasure

141
00:05:47.523 --> 00:05:49.934
the rest of the world can benefit from.

142
00:05:49.934 --> 00:05:51.886
And so, I sold my company then,

143
00:05:51.886 --> 00:05:53.720
The Raiders of the Lost Ark,

144
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.728
and we started Amazon Herb Company,

145
00:05:56.728 --> 00:05:58.623
and just began to bring back botanicals

146
00:05:58.623 --> 00:06:00.616
and formulate, and we worked

147
00:06:00.616 --> 00:06:03.214
with a variety of doctors and practitioners

148
00:06:03.214 --> 00:06:04.676
in the U.S. and Canada, and Spain

149
00:06:04.676 --> 00:06:07.471
and Belgium, formulating product.

150
00:06:07.471 --> 00:06:08.601
<v Regina>And that's interesting.</v>

151
00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:10.393
We'll get to that part a little bit later.

152
00:06:10.393 --> 00:06:12.292
But, you really did make your original inroads

153
00:06:12.292 --> 00:06:14.660
through the medical field.

154
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.078
Which, it seems as though

155
00:06:16.078 --> 00:06:17.657
people have had such a fight.

156
00:06:17.657 --> 00:06:18.659
There's been such a fight

157
00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:20.985
between the naturalists and the medical field,

158
00:06:20.985 --> 00:06:22.169
and trying to meld the two.

159
00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.440
But you, actually, had an early track on that.

160
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.736
<v ->Yes, I was probably one of the early fighters on that.</v>

161
00:06:27.736 --> 00:06:28.781
(laughs)

162
00:06:28.781 --> 00:06:31.309
It was a lot more of a fight back then,

163
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:34.584
but we had people that were interested.

164
00:06:34.584 --> 00:06:37.122
And, obviously, you run into a lot of people

165
00:06:37.122 --> 00:06:39.817
that were very interested in this.

166
00:06:39.817 --> 00:06:42.579
Medical practitioners that were interested,

167
00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:44.768
although the majority were not.

168
00:06:44.768 --> 00:06:46.070
And I was very enthusiastic,

169
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.574
very passionate about this,

170
00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:48.971
because I knew what a gift this was

171
00:06:48.971 --> 00:06:50.528
to the rest of the world,

172
00:06:50.528 --> 00:06:52.544
and my mind immediately went to,

173
00:06:52.544 --> 00:06:54.912
well it should go to the practitioners,

174
00:06:54.912 --> 00:06:57.045
because they're dealing with the patients.

175
00:06:57.045 --> 00:06:58.837
They've got to know about this.

176
00:06:58.837 --> 00:07:00.554
And so, we're taking it to them.

177
00:07:00.554 --> 00:07:03.039
So there's a lot of "no"s, they weren't interested.

178
00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:04.991
"Give us more evidence and more proof,"

179
00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:07.103
so that was a fight.

180
00:07:07.103 --> 00:07:08.746
And then, at the same time,

181
00:07:08.746 --> 00:07:10.751
we would meet natural practitioners

182
00:07:10.751 --> 00:07:13.396
that would really, just, readily absorb this,

183
00:07:13.396 --> 00:07:15.529
and began to put it into play.

184
00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:18.270
And we really began to see results there.

185
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.870
So, what I learned was that the fight,

186
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.099
there was no reason to--

187
00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:24.265
time is your most precious resource.

188
00:07:24.265 --> 00:07:25.811
So, if somebody's not interested,

189
00:07:25.811 --> 00:07:28.392
that's fine, because other people are interested.

190
00:07:28.392 --> 00:07:30.323
So you find the people that are interested,

191
00:07:30.323 --> 00:07:32.019
and spend the time there.

192
00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:34.109
Once I made that kind of realization,

193
00:07:34.109 --> 00:07:35.869
I stopped spending so much time

194
00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:37.608
trying to convince someone,

195
00:07:37.608 --> 00:07:39.304
because many people were open

196
00:07:39.304 --> 00:07:41.117
and understood the value of it.

197
00:07:41.117 --> 00:07:42.365
So, since that time,

198
00:07:42.365 --> 00:07:46.716
and that's been, what, 17, almost 18 years now,

199
00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:49.084
there's a whole consciousness shift

200
00:07:49.084 --> 00:07:50.748
in the population.

201
00:07:50.748 --> 00:07:52.124
I mean, as a species, things are changing

202
00:07:52.124 --> 00:07:53.884
very, very quickly now.

203
00:07:53.884 --> 00:07:55.655
So, then, you had maybe

204
00:07:55.655 --> 00:07:56.977
one out of 20 people that were

205
00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:59.921
eating an herb, or a vitamin, or something like that.

206
00:07:59.921 --> 00:08:02.449
And now that ratio's like one out of two.

207
00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:04.059
50% of the population.

208
00:08:04.059 --> 00:08:05.681
So, it's changed that fast,

209
00:08:05.681 --> 00:08:08.816
in that short a period of time.

210
00:08:08.816 --> 00:08:11.280
And so, it was during that period of time,

211
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.131
selling material only to practitioners and doctors,

212
00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:18.011
the patients started calling and saying,

213
00:08:18.011 --> 00:08:19.376
"gee, this stuff is really good.

214
00:08:19.376 --> 00:08:21.402
"I would just like to get some."

215
00:08:21.402 --> 00:08:22.981
And at that point in time, we were

216
00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:25.306
exclusively selling to practitioners.

217
00:08:25.306 --> 00:08:26.415
And then we opened up a model

218
00:08:26.415 --> 00:08:29.135
to make it available to everyone,

219
00:08:29.135 --> 00:08:32.100
so that's kind of the evolution of it.

220
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.028
<v Regina>Well, and the reason</v>

221
00:08:33.028 --> 00:08:34.404
this has become in demand,

222
00:08:34.404 --> 00:08:36.655
because our products of the earth

223
00:08:36.655 --> 00:08:39.215
that we see in the grocery store, supermarkets,

224
00:08:39.215 --> 00:08:43.854
are denuded of almost any nutritional value in some cases,

225
00:08:43.854 --> 00:08:46.339
and you're talking about a region of the world

226
00:08:46.339 --> 00:08:48.846
that is so alive, has such great life force,

227
00:08:48.846 --> 00:08:50.382
is so rich with nutrients

228
00:08:50.382 --> 00:08:53.763
that the rest of the planet is truly starving for.

229
00:08:53.763 --> 00:08:55.971
And you talk about five points

230
00:08:55.971 --> 00:08:57.901
of irrefutable truths.

231
00:08:57.901 --> 00:09:01.272
And, can we just go ahead and move through that list?

232
00:09:01.272 --> 00:09:03.309
It's a short list, but it's a very important

233
00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:04.397
and powerful list.

234
00:09:04.397 --> 00:09:08.002
And the first is, our planet is oxygen deprived.

235
00:09:08.002 --> 00:09:11.597
<v ->Yeah, the oxygen is so, so important.</v>

236
00:09:11.597 --> 00:09:13.346
I think everyone will agree with that.

237
00:09:13.346 --> 00:09:14.807
That's what I call an undeniable truth.

238
00:09:14.807 --> 00:09:19.807
Most people understand oxygen is important to life.

239
00:09:20.023 --> 00:09:22.508
And the problem we're seeing right now,

240
00:09:22.508 --> 00:09:24.993
with the climatic changes in the world,

241
00:09:24.993 --> 00:09:27.670
where does oxygen originate?

242
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.059
Oxygen comes from plants.

243
00:09:30.059 --> 00:09:31.563
People have to take that step, and say,

244
00:09:31.563 --> 00:09:33.430
"where does the oxygen come from?

245
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:34.464
"It comes from plants.

246
00:09:34.464 --> 00:09:35.862
"Plants are what's producing the oxygen

247
00:09:35.862 --> 00:09:37.462
"giving us oxygen."

248
00:09:37.462 --> 00:09:40.992
So they're taking in CO2, and giving us back oxygen.

249
00:09:40.992 --> 00:09:42.411
Now, that's a good deal!

250
00:09:42.411 --> 00:09:43.733
No matter how you think about it.

251
00:09:43.733 --> 00:09:47.957
And we're losing about six football fields a minute

252
00:09:47.957 --> 00:09:50.261
deforestation in the Amazon.

253
00:09:50.261 --> 00:09:53.226
Six football fields a minute, 24 hours a day.

254
00:09:53.226 --> 00:09:54.666
<v Regina>That's hard to even comprehend.</v>

255
00:09:54.666 --> 00:09:56.810
<v ->Yeah, this is a football field,</v>

256
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.196
six football fields' worth of

257
00:09:58.196 --> 00:10:00.660
oxygen-producing plants--
<v Regina>A minute.</v>

258
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.079
<v ->A minute.</v>

259
00:10:02.079 --> 00:10:04.585
So, we're seeing a decrease in

260
00:10:04.585 --> 00:10:08.318
the concentration of the garden

261
00:10:08.318 --> 00:10:11.454
of oxygen-producing area in the Amazon Basin,

262
00:10:11.454 --> 00:10:13.225
so we're seeing a decrease

263
00:10:13.225 --> 00:10:17.864
in the oxygen-producing capacity of our world.

264
00:10:17.864 --> 00:10:19.816
<v Regina>Well, we're having an increase in population.</v>

265
00:10:19.816 --> 00:10:21.352
<v ->Well, we've got an increase in population.</v>

266
00:10:21.352 --> 00:10:22.504
Exactly.

267
00:10:22.504 --> 00:10:23.805
<v Regina>Not good.</v>

268
00:10:23.805 --> 00:10:25.597
<v ->Well, it's not so good, you're exactly right.</v>

269
00:10:25.597 --> 00:10:27.474
And then, the other thing you referred to,

270
00:10:27.474 --> 00:10:30.365
with the foods in the grocery store and things,

271
00:10:30.365 --> 00:10:32.573
devoid of nutrition,

272
00:10:32.573 --> 00:10:36.071
there's a couple of real strong points here

273
00:10:36.071 --> 00:10:39.068
that we can look at.

274
00:10:39.068 --> 00:10:40.860
Which comes to the second undeniable truth

275
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.153
of biodiversity in the Amazon.

276
00:10:43.153 --> 00:10:45.009
Hundreds of thousands of species of plants,

277
00:10:45.009 --> 00:10:47.825
hundreds of thousands of insects.

278
00:10:47.825 --> 00:10:50.289
You've got tens of thousands of animals.

279
00:10:50.289 --> 00:10:52.796
There's more fish in the Amazon River,

280
00:10:52.796 --> 00:10:54.139
more species of fish, than in

281
00:10:54.139 --> 00:10:56.369
all the world's oceans combined.

282
00:10:56.369 --> 00:10:58.043
That's a pretty startling fact

283
00:10:58.043 --> 00:10:59.835
that most people wouldn't recognize.

284
00:10:59.835 --> 00:11:03.526
So this biodiversity is incredibly important.

285
00:11:03.526 --> 00:11:05.264
It's a repository of minerals,

286
00:11:05.264 --> 00:11:09.029
it's a repository of life force, of life energy,

287
00:11:09.029 --> 00:11:12.485
as well as chemistry, nutrition, information

288
00:11:12.485 --> 00:11:14.256
in these plants and in the rain forest,

289
00:11:14.256 --> 00:11:17.359
like no place else in the world.

290
00:11:17.359 --> 00:11:22.359
So these things that the indigenous people are eating,

291
00:11:22.468 --> 00:11:24.996
and once you get upriver, like several days,

292
00:11:24.996 --> 00:11:26.671
and you really got to get further and further now

293
00:11:26.671 --> 00:11:29.808
to find communities that aren't affected by

294
00:11:31.488 --> 00:11:34.971
processed bread, and sugars, and things like this.

295
00:11:34.971 --> 00:11:36.240
But when you do get upriver

296
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.680
to those communities,

297
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.701
what you find is there aren't any degenerative disease.

298
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.186
The cancer, arthritis, diabetes,

299
00:11:44.186 --> 00:11:46.341
these types of things just aren't there.

300
00:11:46.341 --> 00:11:48.943
And that's a very striking difference

301
00:11:48.943 --> 00:11:51.012
from where we live.

302
00:11:51.012 --> 00:11:51.844
<v Regina>Most people are dying</v>

303
00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:53.754
of degenerative diseases here.

304
00:11:53.754 --> 00:11:56.079
<v ->Cardiovascular disease is the number one killer,</v>

305
00:11:56.079 --> 00:11:57.167
followed by cancer.

306
00:11:57.167 --> 00:11:59.397
So yeah, it's all degenerative disease is what's--

307
00:11:59.397 --> 00:12:02.884
<v Regina>And followed very closely by prescription drugs.</v>

308
00:12:02.884 --> 00:12:04.271
<v ->Yeah, by prescription drugs.</v>

309
00:12:04.271 --> 00:12:05.967
Even according to the prescription.

310
00:12:05.967 --> 00:12:06.831
<v Regina>Exactly.</v>

311
00:12:06.831 --> 00:12:09.145
<v ->So those are the biggest killers here,</v>

312
00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:10.532
they're not the biggest killers there.

313
00:12:10.532 --> 00:12:11.584
What's the difference?

314
00:12:11.584 --> 00:12:13.258
The difference is, of course,

315
00:12:13.258 --> 00:12:15.306
the environment they're living in,

316
00:12:15.306 --> 00:12:17.343
and the food supply.

317
00:12:17.343 --> 00:12:19.295
You know, what they're taking in.

318
00:12:19.295 --> 00:12:22.943
Because we all take in, and process our environment.

319
00:12:22.943 --> 00:12:25.375
As air, food, sunshine, water goes in,

320
00:12:25.375 --> 00:12:28.585
we convert that to living tissue and energy,

321
00:12:28.585 --> 00:12:30.719
and then we eliminate the waste.

322
00:12:30.719 --> 00:12:32.510
So we're just processing the environment.

323
00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.601
What they're processing is of

324
00:12:34.601 --> 00:12:37.203
a whole different density of chemistry,

325
00:12:37.203 --> 00:12:38.985
nutrition, and information.

326
00:12:38.985 --> 00:12:40.777
No degenerative disease.

327
00:12:40.777 --> 00:12:42.142
Here, of course, most of the food

328
00:12:42.142 --> 00:12:43.976
is commercially grown food.

329
00:12:43.976 --> 00:12:46.184
So, the plants are growing in an area

330
00:12:46.184 --> 00:12:49.043
that they may not normally have grown.

331
00:12:49.043 --> 00:12:52.061
So, they're planted in this area.

332
00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:54.333
They're growing in soil that's depleted

333
00:12:54.333 --> 00:12:58.024
of the minerals because it's become exhausted,

334
00:12:58.024 --> 00:13:00.530
and they're grown, not for nutrition,

335
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.858
they're grown to--
<v Regina>For bulk and beauty</v>

336
00:13:03.858 --> 00:13:07.122
<v ->Yeah, bulk and beauty, so--
<v Regina>And then you throw</v>

337
00:13:07.122 --> 00:13:10.449
radiation in, and genetically modified organisms,

338
00:13:10.449 --> 00:13:13.841
and you really have a very unhealthy cocktail.

339
00:13:13.841 --> 00:13:16.049
<v ->You've got an unhealthy cocktail</v>

340
00:13:16.049 --> 00:13:18.537
that manifests itself as--

341
00:13:18.537 --> 00:13:19.757
<v Regina>Unhealthy people.</v>

342
00:13:19.757 --> 00:13:22.046
<v ->Cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes.</v>

343
00:13:22.046 --> 00:13:24.136
<v Regina>Now, that said, in the jungle,</v>

344
00:13:24.136 --> 00:13:25.182
it's not as though people have

345
00:13:25.182 --> 00:13:26.557
a necessarily longer lifespan,

346
00:13:26.557 --> 00:13:29.203
because you have snake bites, right?

347
00:13:29.203 --> 00:13:32.168
You have other kinds of airborne,

348
00:13:32.168 --> 00:13:34.120
mosquito borne types of diseases

349
00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.069
that we know about.

350
00:13:35.069 --> 00:13:36.232
A whole different thing, though.

351
00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:37.975
These are quick, life-threatening, and it's done.

352
00:13:37.975 --> 00:13:40.290
You don't just die, in essence,

353
00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:41.527
from the moment you hit 20,

354
00:13:41.527 --> 00:13:43.106
you don't start degenerating.

355
00:13:43.106 --> 00:13:43.703
<v ->Yeah, you're right.</v>

356
00:13:43.703 --> 00:13:45.148
There's certainly challenges there.

357
00:13:45.148 --> 00:13:47.996
And, certainly, there's, like you say,

358
00:13:47.996 --> 00:13:51.463
parasitic related issues is a big problem there.

359
00:13:51.463 --> 00:13:55.473
Malaria, Dengue Fever, Yellow Fever,

360
00:13:55.473 --> 00:13:58.492
mosquito borne issues are a problem.

361
00:13:58.492 --> 00:14:00.635
Snake bite, in many cases, some communities,

362
00:14:00.635 --> 00:14:03.697
it's the largest killer.

363
00:14:03.697 --> 00:14:05.019
It's the biggest cause of death

364
00:14:05.019 --> 00:14:07.483
in those communities.

365
00:14:07.483 --> 00:14:08.368
<v Regina>But the point is, they live</v>

366
00:14:08.368 --> 00:14:11.589
until they die, and meet an unfortunate event

367
00:14:11.589 --> 00:14:12.848
of some kind,

368
00:14:12.848 --> 00:14:14.405
they live with vigor.

369
00:14:14.405 --> 00:14:15.696
Unlike us.

370
00:14:15.696 --> 00:14:17.306
I mean, how many people spend

371
00:14:17.306 --> 00:14:19.973
more time than necessary on the couch,

372
00:14:19.973 --> 00:14:21.317
just because they don't have the energy

373
00:14:21.317 --> 00:14:23.013
to go anywhere else, now?

374
00:14:23.013 --> 00:14:23.599
<v ->Yeah.</v>

375
00:14:23.599 --> 00:14:25.775
It's really sad, what's happened here,

376
00:14:25.775 --> 00:14:27.706
because the degenerative, you know,

377
00:14:27.706 --> 00:14:29.839
degenerating from the inside out,

378
00:14:29.839 --> 00:14:31.396
and people get to a certain age

379
00:14:31.396 --> 00:14:32.740
where those degenerative things

380
00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.087
manifest themselves to such a degree

381
00:14:35.087 --> 00:14:37.198
that they're just completely incapacitated.

382
00:14:37.198 --> 00:14:39.428
Their life experience is not

383
00:14:39.428 --> 00:14:40.964
an enjoyable life experience.

384
00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:42.287
They're not fully functioning.

385
00:14:42.287 --> 00:14:43.652
They're not expressing themselves

386
00:14:43.652 --> 00:14:45.647
in a sense of contribution.

387
00:14:45.647 --> 00:14:48.292
In fact, they become, like, a negative vortex

388
00:14:48.292 --> 00:14:51.225
where it takes so much, carries so much energy,

389
00:14:51.225 --> 00:14:53.433
to keep them alive.

390
00:14:53.433 --> 00:14:56.057
And they go through a period of time

391
00:14:56.057 --> 00:14:59.438
where they spend all of their resources

392
00:14:59.438 --> 00:15:01.902
and everything just staying alive.

393
00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:05.038
<v Regina>It's very sad, and we see it all the time.</v>

394
00:15:05.038 --> 00:15:06.978
And we see it around us, I think, every family.

395
00:15:06.978 --> 00:15:09.652
Most of us, people watching right now,

396
00:15:09.652 --> 00:15:11.615
know people that are in exactly this situation,

397
00:15:11.615 --> 00:15:13.034
if not themselves.

398
00:15:13.034 --> 00:15:14.356
<v ->Yeah.
<v Regina>The point is,</v>

399
00:15:14.356 --> 00:15:15.657
there's a choice.

400
00:15:15.657 --> 00:15:20.657
And the Amazon offers a lot of this--

401
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.174
again, I keep going back to life force,

402
00:15:22.174 --> 00:15:24.659
just looking at the plants.

403
00:15:24.659 --> 00:15:26.942
Actually, I've known of your company

404
00:15:26.942 --> 00:15:28.073
for many years, and have used

405
00:15:28.073 --> 00:15:30.163
various of the products off and on

406
00:15:30.163 --> 00:15:31.976
through the years, and always found

407
00:15:31.976 --> 00:15:34.067
this kind of life force boost

408
00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:35.965
whenever I would consume them.

409
00:15:35.965 --> 00:15:38.472
So, what's going on in these medicinal plants

410
00:15:38.472 --> 00:15:40.445
that we're not finding, say,

411
00:15:40.445 --> 00:15:42.632
on the grocery store shelves,

412
00:15:42.632 --> 00:15:45.511
in our multivitamins and Geritol?

413
00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:47.047
<v ->Well, it's really easy.</v>

414
00:15:47.047 --> 00:15:50.439
You think that there's 3,000 edible

415
00:15:50.439 --> 00:15:53.308
fruits in the Amazon.

416
00:15:53.308 --> 00:15:55.079
What you find on your store shelves,

417
00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:57.468
you may have got, what, 40 or 50?

418
00:15:57.468 --> 00:15:59.463
You look at people's daily diet.

419
00:15:59.463 --> 00:16:01.830
They consume, in the course of a year,

420
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:05.809
they may have 30 items that they're consuming.

421
00:16:05.809 --> 00:16:07.867
And that's all they consume.

422
00:16:07.867 --> 00:16:10.374
You know, 30 different plants or animals

423
00:16:10.374 --> 00:16:11.889
and that's it.

424
00:16:11.889 --> 00:16:13.392
So there's no biodiversity.

425
00:16:13.392 --> 00:16:14.864
It's not even available.

426
00:16:14.864 --> 00:16:18.459
So, in the rainforest, of course, there is.

427
00:16:18.459 --> 00:16:19.717
So, what's going on?

428
00:16:19.717 --> 00:16:22.085
What's going on, some things we understand,

429
00:16:22.085 --> 00:16:24.144
some things we don't understand.

430
00:16:24.144 --> 00:16:26.309
Some things we're beginning to discover.

431
00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:28.954
But the concept is really quite simple.

432
00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:33.253
You've got a more concentrated and wild plants,

433
00:16:33.253 --> 00:16:34.596
obviously, you go into the forest,

434
00:16:34.596 --> 00:16:36.410
you find a wild tree,

435
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:39.449
it is the strongest of the species by definition

436
00:16:39.449 --> 00:16:40.559
of the fact that it's alive.

437
00:16:40.559 --> 00:16:41.700
It's living there.

438
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.878
It's survived all the ecological challenge.

439
00:16:44.878 --> 00:16:48.132
So it's got a more dense source of chemistry,

440
00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:51.427
of nutrition, and information.

441
00:16:51.427 --> 00:16:56.334
And the information aspect is really important.

442
00:16:56.334 --> 00:16:58.350
So, our bodies are essentially

443
00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:01.389
a very complex series of organs.

444
00:17:01.389 --> 00:17:03.640
Spleen, thymus, lungs, liver.

445
00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.200
And so, there's an innate intelligence

446
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.917
that orchestrates all of this

447
00:17:07.917 --> 00:17:09.378
to work together.

448
00:17:09.378 --> 00:17:10.626
You know, we don't have to think

449
00:17:10.626 --> 00:17:12.909
about our pancreas.

450
00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:14.551
We don't have to think about our thymus.

451
00:17:14.551 --> 00:17:16.162
We don't have to think about, you know,

452
00:17:16.162 --> 00:17:18.018
these organs doing their job.

453
00:17:18.018 --> 00:17:19.266
They do it automatically.

454
00:17:19.266 --> 00:17:21.452
We don't have to know that we have these organs, right?

455
00:17:21.452 --> 00:17:22.540
People still live.

456
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.929
They're going on this innate intelligence

457
00:17:24.929 --> 00:17:26.604
and orchestrating all of it.

458
00:17:26.604 --> 00:17:27.414
So, what happens is,

459
00:17:27.414 --> 00:17:30.369
when we take in air, food, sunshine, water,

460
00:17:30.369 --> 00:17:31.692
so just think about the food.

461
00:17:31.692 --> 00:17:35.030
The nutrition and the chemistry that we take in.

462
00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.611
The body knows what to do with it, right?

463
00:17:37.611 --> 00:17:39.979
And the problem is, that we're talking about,

464
00:17:39.979 --> 00:17:41.632
the commercial food supply

465
00:17:41.632 --> 00:17:44.853
is so deficient in the things

466
00:17:44.853 --> 00:17:47.531
that would really create a strong vitality,

467
00:17:47.531 --> 00:17:50.144
there's enough life force, barely,

468
00:17:50.144 --> 00:17:52.522
in the food supply, to keep people alive.

469
00:17:52.522 --> 00:17:53.450
<v Regina>True.</v>

470
00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:54.573
<v ->And they think of health as,</v>

471
00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:55.701
"Okay, I'm alive, I can get up,

472
00:17:55.701 --> 00:17:57.670
"I can go to work today, I can come back."

473
00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:58.652
But what I'm talking about

474
00:17:58.652 --> 00:18:00.550
is a whole new level of life experience.

475
00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.363
This is an opportunity we have.

476
00:18:02.363 --> 00:18:04.123
For the first time, I believe,

477
00:18:04.123 --> 00:18:05.425
in the history of our species,

478
00:18:05.425 --> 00:18:09.328
where we have access to the big garden,

479
00:18:09.328 --> 00:18:11.931
the rain forest, with all these species of plants

480
00:18:11.931 --> 00:18:13.573
that can come forward.

481
00:18:13.573 --> 00:18:15.621
And so then, when you're eating these,

482
00:18:15.621 --> 00:18:17.829
your spleen and thymus,

483
00:18:17.829 --> 00:18:19.941
these materials come through the bloodstream,

484
00:18:19.941 --> 00:18:22.490
and they say, "wow, where's that been my whole life?

485
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.165
"Look what I can do now."

486
00:18:24.165 --> 00:18:26.042
And so you get your heart, spleen,

487
00:18:26.042 --> 00:18:27.813
lungs, thymus, liver, kidneys,

488
00:18:27.813 --> 00:18:32.452
all these organs start rallying to a new place of vitality

489
00:18:32.452 --> 00:18:35.545
that expresses itself, and manifests itself,

490
00:18:35.545 --> 00:18:36.335
and you know it.

491
00:18:36.335 --> 00:18:38.233
This is a new level of life experience

492
00:18:38.233 --> 00:18:40.996
that we have an opportunity for now.

493
00:18:40.996 --> 00:18:43.133
<v Regina>Well, and it's interesting, because, we...</v>

494
00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:45.981
in the give and take of everything,

495
00:18:45.981 --> 00:18:47.463
we don't have to worry about,

496
00:18:47.463 --> 00:18:48.423
for the most part.

497
00:18:48.423 --> 00:18:49.394
Most of the people watching this

498
00:18:49.394 --> 00:18:51.186
are at their computer, obviously.

499
00:18:51.186 --> 00:18:53.480
They're all at their computers right now watching this.

500
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.805
And sitting, probably, in an apartment,

501
00:18:55.805 --> 00:18:58.002
or in a house somewhere in the world,

502
00:18:58.002 --> 00:18:59.613
in an area that's been developed enough

503
00:18:59.613 --> 00:19:01.330
to be able to have access to the computer,

504
00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.186
so we don't have to worry about snake bites.

505
00:19:03.186 --> 00:19:04.967
And malaria, and the things that

506
00:19:04.967 --> 00:19:07.548
indigenous people do fall prey to,

507
00:19:07.548 --> 00:19:08.892
are not our concern.

508
00:19:08.892 --> 00:19:10.780
If we can have an absence of those,

509
00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.110
and a presence of that incredible

510
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.964
nutrient load from the Amazon,

511
00:19:15.964 --> 00:19:18.001
then what is possible?

512
00:19:18.001 --> 00:19:19.441
<v ->Well, this is the great thing.</v>

513
00:19:19.441 --> 00:19:21.089
This is the great experiment, you know,

514
00:19:21.089 --> 00:19:23.233
that we're just beginning right now.

515
00:19:23.233 --> 00:19:25.942
So, with the advent of the computer,

516
00:19:25.942 --> 00:19:27.478
and the internet, and information,

517
00:19:27.478 --> 00:19:30.097
we live in an age of exploding

518
00:19:30.097 --> 00:19:32.573
information and technology

519
00:19:32.573 --> 00:19:35.818
that makes the information available to the masses,

520
00:19:35.818 --> 00:19:37.570
so it's changed very, very quickly.

521
00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:40.546
And, just think, just a short hundred years ago,

522
00:19:40.546 --> 00:19:42.167
if you wanted to go to the Amazon,

523
00:19:42.167 --> 00:19:45.004
without an airplane, that's a long, long wait.

524
00:19:45.004 --> 00:19:48.225
Several months in a boat, and that sort of thing.

525
00:19:48.225 --> 00:19:50.092
So, just in that short time span,

526
00:19:50.092 --> 00:19:52.321
not only do we know about these things,

527
00:19:52.321 --> 00:19:56.267
but now they're instantly available.

528
00:19:56.267 --> 00:19:57.910
So, where can we go?

529
00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:59.094
I don't know.

530
00:19:59.094 --> 00:20:00.470
I don't know how long we can live.

531
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:02.997
I don't know how good we can feel.

532
00:20:02.997 --> 00:20:05.525
But I'm in for the full ride here.

533
00:20:05.525 --> 00:20:07.296
(Regina laughs)
I know that I'm feeling

534
00:20:07.296 --> 00:20:09.589
better than I felt in my life.

535
00:20:09.589 --> 00:20:11.445
And, obviously, in my early twenties,

536
00:20:11.445 --> 00:20:13.397
I was having a near-death experience,

537
00:20:13.397 --> 00:20:14.485
and all that's changed,

538
00:20:14.485 --> 00:20:15.925
all that's turned around.

539
00:20:15.925 --> 00:20:17.972
The body organs rebuild themselves.

540
00:20:17.972 --> 00:20:20.340
Some organs rebuild themselves

541
00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.804
in a matter of weeks, others in a matter of months.

542
00:20:22.804 --> 00:20:23.871
Cells die.

543
00:20:23.871 --> 00:20:26.196
New cells are replacing those.

544
00:20:26.196 --> 00:20:27.935
So, depending on what nutrient matter

545
00:20:27.935 --> 00:20:30.004
those new cells have, you know,

546
00:20:30.004 --> 00:20:31.806
what chemistry, nutrition, and information

547
00:20:31.806 --> 00:20:33.086
those new cells have,

548
00:20:33.086 --> 00:20:34.761
what resonance they come in at,

549
00:20:34.761 --> 00:20:37.107
they're rebuilding our whole bodies

550
00:20:37.107 --> 00:20:39.774
over a period of a year, 18 months,

551
00:20:39.774 --> 00:20:41.608
you've got an entirely new body,

552
00:20:41.608 --> 00:20:44.947
and new cells that weren't there 18 months ago.

553
00:20:44.947 --> 00:20:46.483
<v Regina>So, it's never too late to begin.</v>

554
00:20:46.483 --> 00:20:48.574
And let's talk about that whole notion

555
00:20:48.574 --> 00:20:50.664
of bioinformation.

556
00:20:50.664 --> 00:20:54.216
And, we know now that the cells communicate,

557
00:20:54.216 --> 00:20:57.192
are fully sustaining in and of themselves,

558
00:20:57.192 --> 00:20:58.952
and they communicate with each other

559
00:20:58.952 --> 00:21:01.138
through very sophisticated mechanisms.

560
00:21:01.138 --> 00:21:02.248
What happens when you put

561
00:21:02.248 --> 00:21:06.802
this incredibly rich bioinformation into the mix?

562
00:21:06.802 --> 00:21:11.802
<v ->Well, I think you get an energetic shift</v>

563
00:21:11.858 --> 00:21:14.812
that allows the transport, the receiving

564
00:21:14.812 --> 00:21:17.575
and the transmitting of that information

565
00:21:17.575 --> 00:21:20.220
to go in a very uninterrupted way.

566
00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.822
Maybe it's something over the synaptic clefts.

567
00:21:22.822 --> 00:21:26.790
I don't know, but that energy really shifts.

568
00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:30.601
Because plants, like humans, will store

569
00:21:30.601 --> 00:21:34.548
the memories of their whole life growing up.

570
00:21:34.548 --> 00:21:36.243
Obviously, in a rain forest, you've got plants

571
00:21:36.243 --> 00:21:38.643
that are coming up with a history

572
00:21:38.643 --> 00:21:41.800
of biological balance.

573
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.467
Balance and harmony their whole life.

574
00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:49.181
And the whole biodiversity in their surroundings.

575
00:21:49.181 --> 00:21:51.037
And then you've got information

576
00:21:51.037 --> 00:21:53.938
from plants that are commercially grown,

577
00:21:53.938 --> 00:21:55.975
that simply don't have any biodiversity.

578
00:21:55.975 --> 00:21:58.077
<v Regina>They're all like little orphans.</v>

579
00:21:58.077 --> 00:21:59.303
<v ->They're all, yeah. (laughs)
<v Regina>There's nobody</v>

580
00:21:59.303 --> 00:22:00.537
to raise them or teach them anything.

581
00:22:00.537 --> 00:22:01.860
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>

582
00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:02.836
That's exactly right.

583
00:22:02.836 --> 00:22:03.945
So, we've got corn coming up

584
00:22:03.945 --> 00:22:05.342
that looks around its whole life,

585
00:22:05.342 --> 00:22:07.475
and it's surrounded by nothing but corn.

586
00:22:07.475 --> 00:22:09.545
It's grown in soil, so it doesn't have the minerals,

587
00:22:09.545 --> 00:22:11.752
so it's essentially starved.

588
00:22:11.752 --> 00:22:13.395
And growing beside an interstate highway,

589
00:22:13.395 --> 00:22:14.952
so it's breathing in exhaust fumes.

590
00:22:14.952 --> 00:22:17.459
So, these are not necessarily happy plants.

591
00:22:17.459 --> 00:22:19.784
So that energy that we eat,

592
00:22:19.784 --> 00:22:22.034
and let's face it, eating is a very intimate activity.

593
00:22:22.034 --> 00:22:24.776
We're taking everything about this plant,

594
00:22:24.776 --> 00:22:26.493
you know, the source, the history,

595
00:22:26.493 --> 00:22:29.725
chemistry, information, everything about that,

596
00:22:29.725 --> 00:22:31.900
and ingesting it into our body.

597
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:36.381
We're learning now, like you're pointing out,

598
00:22:36.381 --> 00:22:38.984
that it's not just about that chemistry

599
00:22:38.984 --> 00:22:41.095
that's in there and it interfaces.

600
00:22:41.095 --> 00:22:42.695
The energetics, the information,

601
00:22:42.695 --> 00:22:44.466
the bioinformation we refer to.

602
00:22:44.466 --> 00:22:46.322
All that's going in.

603
00:22:46.322 --> 00:22:47.826
And we find people eating

604
00:22:47.826 --> 00:22:49.383
the plants from the rainforest.

605
00:22:49.383 --> 00:22:51.122
That information resides.

606
00:22:51.122 --> 00:22:52.775
Either at a subtle level,

607
00:22:52.775 --> 00:22:55.281
or it manifests itself more overtly,

608
00:22:55.281 --> 00:22:58.396
depending on their state of consciousness

609
00:22:58.396 --> 00:23:02.012
and how that information could be utilized.

610
00:23:02.012 --> 00:23:03.409
<v Regina>Let's talk about consciousness,</v>

611
00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:04.827
because consciousness is a part

612
00:23:04.827 --> 00:23:05.873
of every living thing.

613
00:23:05.873 --> 00:23:09.232
And I think that often people think that--

614
00:23:09.232 --> 00:23:10.928
well, the only plant most people

615
00:23:10.928 --> 00:23:13.488
watching this interview have heard of,

616
00:23:13.488 --> 00:23:15.973
or many people watching this interview

617
00:23:15.973 --> 00:23:17.477
have heard of, is ayahuasca.

618
00:23:17.477 --> 00:23:18.405
A lot of people take trips

619
00:23:18.405 --> 00:23:20.058
down to the Amazon

620
00:23:20.058 --> 00:23:21.957
in order to be able to expose themselves

621
00:23:21.957 --> 00:23:24.975
to the mind and consciousness-altering

622
00:23:24.975 --> 00:23:26.671
experience of ayahuasca,

623
00:23:26.671 --> 00:23:28.762
but ayahuasca isn't the only

624
00:23:28.762 --> 00:23:31.183
consciousness-altering plant.

625
00:23:31.183 --> 00:23:33.316
You're talking about many subtle realms

626
00:23:33.316 --> 00:23:35.247
of shifting of consciousness

627
00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:37.284
within these plants that you're speaking of

628
00:23:37.284 --> 00:23:38.980
that are known as medicinals.

629
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.359
Can you talk about that for a little bit?

630
00:23:42.459 --> 00:23:43.535
<v ->Sure I can.</v>

631
00:23:43.535 --> 00:23:46.020
And maybe I'll start with the ayahuasca,

632
00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.546
since you brought the ayahuasca up,

633
00:23:47.546 --> 00:23:49.551
and ayahuasca is a very strong

634
00:23:49.551 --> 00:23:51.823
and a very important medicine.

635
00:23:53.633 --> 00:23:56.559
Obviously, the Ayahuasceros, the Curanderos.

636
00:23:56.559 --> 00:24:00.193
It's widely used all over the Amazon Basin.

637
00:24:00.193 --> 00:24:03.275
Ayahuasca is a vine, called a

638
00:24:03.275 --> 00:24:05.014
Banisteriopsis Caapi,

639
00:24:05.014 --> 00:24:06.966
and, when they prepare the ayahuasca,

640
00:24:06.966 --> 00:24:10.774
it's prepared in a space of reverence

641
00:24:10.774 --> 00:24:13.429
because they consider the ayahuasca

642
00:24:13.429 --> 00:24:16.395
like the mother of the entire plant kingdom.

643
00:24:16.395 --> 00:24:18.858
So that's why it's so important.

644
00:24:18.858 --> 00:24:21.013
And they thought it was important for me,

645
00:24:21.013 --> 00:24:23.690
they, some of the Curanderos and the Chamanes,

646
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:26.901
to experience this because it opens up

647
00:24:26.901 --> 00:24:30.218
the communication with the plants.

648
00:24:30.218 --> 00:24:34.420
And so, it's very strong medicine.

649
00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:36.553
It's not recreational.

650
00:24:36.553 --> 00:24:38.484
And it's done under the guidance

651
00:24:38.484 --> 00:24:42.174
of an Ayahuascero, so they're singing

652
00:24:42.174 --> 00:24:44.681
the Icaros, or the ayahuasca songs,

653
00:24:44.681 --> 00:24:47.241
where they're calling in, like,

654
00:24:47.241 --> 00:24:50.142
the boa, and the plants' energies

655
00:24:50.142 --> 00:24:52.115
and spirits to come in.

656
00:24:52.115 --> 00:24:53.907
So when you do it,

657
00:24:53.907 --> 00:24:58.333
it tends to, obviously, you get sick.

658
00:24:58.333 --> 00:25:01.234
I mean, you're throwing up.

659
00:25:01.234 --> 00:25:02.866
It's very cleansing.

660
00:25:02.866 --> 00:25:05.277
You're purging, and you're sweating,

661
00:25:05.277 --> 00:25:07.165
and your heart's racing, and your heart's beating.

662
00:25:07.165 --> 00:25:09.927
And then you get, the hallucinations come on.

663
00:25:09.927 --> 00:25:11.783
It's very psychoactive.

664
00:25:11.783 --> 00:25:13.426
And, normally, it will bring up

665
00:25:13.426 --> 00:25:15.143
whatever your worst fear is,

666
00:25:15.143 --> 00:25:17.169
and it will manifest it in some form.

667
00:25:17.169 --> 00:25:19.281
So, now you've got to deal with that

668
00:25:19.281 --> 00:25:21.948
during this whole experience.

669
00:25:21.948 --> 00:25:23.718
But, at the same time,

670
00:25:23.718 --> 00:25:25.340
I think it unzips a file,

671
00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:29.030
unzips various files in our brain,

672
00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:31.984
that we don't normally have access to.

673
00:25:31.984 --> 00:25:34.416
And these are files that, for example,

674
00:25:34.416 --> 00:25:38.811
when we were born, or before we were born,

675
00:25:38.811 --> 00:25:41.339
when the sperm and the egg come together,

676
00:25:41.339 --> 00:25:44.122
and form a zygote, and that begins to expand.

677
00:25:44.122 --> 00:25:46.864
Normally, I suppose a normal understanding

678
00:25:46.864 --> 00:25:48.421
would be that we learn everything we know

679
00:25:48.421 --> 00:25:49.743
in this lifetime.

680
00:25:49.743 --> 00:25:52.250
But, obviously, the information of our parents

681
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:55.247
are in that sperm and in that egg.

682
00:25:55.247 --> 00:25:57.060
It determines the color of our hair,

683
00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.332
the color of our eyes, how tall we are.

684
00:25:59.332 --> 00:26:00.889
All that information's there.

685
00:26:00.889 --> 00:26:02.767
So the information of their life experience

686
00:26:02.767 --> 00:26:04.900
is also there, but we don't normally

687
00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.734
have access to that.

688
00:26:06.734 --> 00:26:08.644
And, likewise, the grandparents,

689
00:26:08.644 --> 00:26:09.593
and the great-grandparents.

690
00:26:09.593 --> 00:26:11.427
This goes all the way back.

691
00:26:11.427 --> 00:26:13.049
So, I think with ayahuasca, it kind of

692
00:26:13.049 --> 00:26:16.099
unzips that file and gives you the experience

693
00:26:16.099 --> 00:26:19.907
and information of your entire genealogy.

694
00:26:19.907 --> 00:26:22.872
So, look at the entire genealogy of everybody.

695
00:26:22.872 --> 00:26:26.200
That goes back to the source.

696
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.640
And so, that's the information

697
00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.962
you've got access to,

698
00:26:28.962 --> 00:26:32.397
almost in a very spiral-coded form,

699
00:26:32.397 --> 00:26:34.231
during this whole experience.

700
00:26:34.231 --> 00:26:36.780
So, it's very strong medicine.

701
00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.135
<v Regina>Very strong medicine.</v>

702
00:26:38.135 --> 00:26:40.076
<v ->You spend a lot of time talking about it.</v>

703
00:26:40.076 --> 00:26:42.817
But it does, in the end, I think,

704
00:26:42.817 --> 00:26:45.495
open up a channel of knowingness

705
00:26:45.495 --> 00:26:48.929
and communication with the plants,

706
00:26:48.929 --> 00:26:50.134
with the living plants.

707
00:26:50.134 --> 00:26:52.481
So it's very important.

708
00:26:52.481 --> 00:26:55.403
And every plant has the information in it.

709
00:26:55.403 --> 00:26:56.822
So when we eat different plants,

710
00:26:56.822 --> 00:26:59.467
we're getting a whole variety of information.

711
00:26:59.467 --> 00:27:01.120
<v Regina>And I've heard some of the people</v>

712
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.965
that take a lot of the Amazonian herbs

713
00:27:04.965 --> 00:27:06.944
say that there is a process of

714
00:27:06.944 --> 00:27:08.992
kind of awakening in consciousness

715
00:27:08.992 --> 00:27:10.923
and clarity that begins happening

716
00:27:10.923 --> 00:27:13.546
just taking these nutrients as well.

717
00:27:13.546 --> 00:27:15.680
So, and these are more subtle levels

718
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.325
of opening of consciousness, I would assume.

719
00:27:18.325 --> 00:27:20.159
<v ->Oh sure, yeah, it is.</v>

720
00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:24.106
It's very rich in bioinformation.

721
00:27:24.106 --> 00:27:25.962
So, you do it on a longer-term basis,

722
00:27:25.962 --> 00:27:28.074
you really begin to recognize that

723
00:27:28.074 --> 00:27:30.655
you may be more centered, more balanced.

724
00:27:30.655 --> 00:27:32.692
Perhaps things that used to bother you

725
00:27:32.692 --> 00:27:35.348
really, you're able to ascertain that

726
00:27:35.348 --> 00:27:37.940
that's not really important stuff anymore.

727
00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.843
So, really, it gives you a level of understanding

728
00:27:41.843 --> 00:27:46.843
of the life experience, even at a level

729
00:27:47.166 --> 00:27:51.251
that may not be totally a conscious level, that's there.

730
00:27:51.251 --> 00:27:52.829
<v Regina>True, that makes sense.</v>

731
00:27:52.829 --> 00:27:54.731
Because in the Quantum view,

732
00:27:54.731 --> 00:27:59.402
you're absorbing balance and harmony into your body,

733
00:27:59.402 --> 00:28:01.404
via the experience of the plants

734
00:28:01.404 --> 00:28:04.092
in this environment that is balanced,

735
00:28:04.092 --> 00:28:06.203
that has found its own balance.

736
00:28:06.203 --> 00:28:07.782
<v ->Yeah, and it starts with energy.</v>

737
00:28:07.782 --> 00:28:10.897
So that energy, that energetic understanding,

738
00:28:12.277 --> 00:28:13.654
if it's not there,

739
00:28:13.654 --> 00:28:16.694
which, say, it would not be there

740
00:28:16.694 --> 00:28:19.456
in the commercial food supply.

741
00:28:19.456 --> 00:28:22.613
Or be there at an almost undetectable level

742
00:28:22.613 --> 00:28:24.693
in a commercial food supply.

743
00:28:24.693 --> 00:28:26.678
So if the energetic level is not there,

744
00:28:26.678 --> 00:28:28.555
and the information is not there,

745
00:28:28.555 --> 00:28:30.208
then you're already down to

746
00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:32.576
almost a very thin membrane

747
00:28:32.576 --> 00:28:36.746
separating those organs and that understanding

748
00:28:36.746 --> 00:28:38.719
from a degenerative state.

749
00:28:38.719 --> 00:28:42.111
So, then, once things begin to degenerate,

750
00:28:42.111 --> 00:28:45.642
on a physical level,

751
00:28:47.622 --> 00:28:49.861
you can go way beyond,

752
00:28:49.861 --> 00:28:52.186
you can build in giant buffers

753
00:28:52.186 --> 00:28:55.108
by moving the energy much, much higher.

754
00:28:55.108 --> 00:28:56.196
If the energy level,

755
00:28:56.196 --> 00:28:58.799
energetic and bioinformation, is not there,

756
00:28:58.799 --> 00:29:00.409
then it gets closer and closer

757
00:29:00.409 --> 00:29:02.212
to actually degenerative state

758
00:29:02.212 --> 00:29:05.646
that is just visible and expressive.

759
00:29:05.646 --> 00:29:07.278
<v Regina>Let's talk about some of the plants.</v>

760
00:29:07.278 --> 00:29:09.251
Let's talk about the life force

761
00:29:09.251 --> 00:29:10.435
of some of your favorites.

762
00:29:10.435 --> 00:29:13.241
One story I like is the camu camu

763
00:29:13.241 --> 00:29:15.470
and what it offers humanity.

764
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:16.654
Can you talk a little bit about that plant?

765
00:29:16.654 --> 00:29:17.934
<v ->Yeah, I can.</v>

766
00:29:17.934 --> 00:29:20.653
The camu is a fascinating plant

767
00:29:20.653 --> 00:29:22.136
for a variety of reasons,

768
00:29:22.136 --> 00:29:26.082
and one that surprised me on many levels,

769
00:29:26.082 --> 00:29:28.802
because the understanding is, of course,

770
00:29:28.802 --> 00:29:31.095
that camu bears a fruit,

771
00:29:31.095 --> 00:29:32.845
about the size of a large cherry,

772
00:29:32.845 --> 00:29:34.487
that has the highest concentration

773
00:29:34.487 --> 00:29:36.460
of naturally-occurring Vitamin C.

774
00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:38.359
More than anything in the world.

775
00:29:38.359 --> 00:29:40.396
So, that's really nice,

776
00:29:40.396 --> 00:29:42.369
since most of the population

777
00:29:42.369 --> 00:29:44.460
is deficient in Vitamin C.

778
00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.454
But, at the same time,

779
00:29:46.454 --> 00:29:48.993
it wasn't that exciting to me.

780
00:29:48.993 --> 00:29:50.177
Because we're dealing with other plants

781
00:29:50.177 --> 00:29:52.033
with oxindole alkaloids

782
00:29:52.033 --> 00:29:54.401
and things that really make a significant difference

783
00:29:54.401 --> 00:29:57.654
for very strong, powerful degenerative issues

784
00:29:57.654 --> 00:29:59.062
that people are dealing with.

785
00:29:59.062 --> 00:30:00.182
And it takes a long time

786
00:30:00.182 --> 00:30:02.923
for these plants to produce fruit.

787
00:30:02.923 --> 00:30:07.776
So, these plants have a very interesting history, the camu.

788
00:30:07.776 --> 00:30:10.282
In that, they grow in the Amazon flood plain,

789
00:30:10.282 --> 00:30:12.213
so that, when they're young,

790
00:30:12.213 --> 00:30:13.734
they're completely underwater

791
00:30:13.734 --> 00:30:15.078
during the rainy season.

792
00:30:15.078 --> 00:30:18.150
The rains come, water levels rise, like, 40 feet.

793
00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:19.867
And so, these plants spend three months

794
00:30:19.867 --> 00:30:22.854
of their life completely submerged.

795
00:30:22.854 --> 00:30:24.411
Totally underwater.

796
00:30:24.411 --> 00:30:27.248
Like, growing inside the Amazon River.

797
00:30:27.248 --> 00:30:29.797
And then, what that does is,

798
00:30:29.797 --> 00:30:33.029
the high water picks up all the biomass,

799
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:38.029
all of the plants that have dropped down,

800
00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.346
the leaves, stems, barks, everything.

801
00:30:40.346 --> 00:30:41.573
The compost.

802
00:30:41.573 --> 00:30:44.453
It picks up all that biomass and moves it around

803
00:30:44.453 --> 00:30:45.914
during the high water.

804
00:30:45.914 --> 00:30:47.770
And then, when the waters recede,

805
00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:49.263
of course, that settles down,

806
00:30:49.263 --> 00:30:51.812
and you go in, you dig out the camu plants,

807
00:30:51.812 --> 00:30:53.113
and stand them up.

808
00:30:53.113 --> 00:30:55.183
And so, these camu camu plants

809
00:30:55.183 --> 00:30:59.726
are living off the richest biomass on the planet.

810
00:31:00.786 --> 00:31:03.874
100,000 species of biodiversity in the Amazon.

811
00:31:03.874 --> 00:31:05.751
When high water comes, it just moves it around,

812
00:31:05.751 --> 00:31:08.119
drops it right on these camu plants.

813
00:31:08.119 --> 00:31:09.836
And they live off that.

814
00:31:09.836 --> 00:31:11.020
And, they're so special because

815
00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.249
they can live underwater for three months.

816
00:31:13.249 --> 00:31:14.881
How do they do that?

817
00:31:14.881 --> 00:31:16.897
And so, they keep growing and keep growing.

818
00:31:16.897 --> 00:31:19.521
It takes about seven years

819
00:31:19.521 --> 00:31:21.313
to really begin to bear fruit.

820
00:31:21.313 --> 00:31:23.745
Year eight, you start getting a lot of fruit.

821
00:31:23.745 --> 00:31:25.729
And when we first got this fruit,

822
00:31:25.729 --> 00:31:28.215
and we dried it,

823
00:31:28.215 --> 00:31:31.111
and I just licked the powder,

824
00:31:31.111 --> 00:31:33.201
in about two minutes I realized

825
00:31:34.161 --> 00:31:35.825
it just cleared my mind,

826
00:31:35.825 --> 00:31:37.500
it brightened the day.

827
00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.078
Something else was happening here.

828
00:31:39.078 --> 00:31:40.636
Made the world a better place.

829
00:31:40.636 --> 00:31:42.545
I said, "this is not about Vitamin C.

830
00:31:42.545 --> 00:31:44.795
"Something else is going on with this."

831
00:31:44.795 --> 00:31:45.883
Yeah, it's the richest source

832
00:31:45.883 --> 00:31:47.579
of naturally-occurring Vitamin C

833
00:31:47.579 --> 00:31:49.062
of anything in the world,

834
00:31:49.062 --> 00:31:50.523
but now I know it's got leucine,

835
00:31:50.523 --> 00:31:53.477
valine, serine, some very important amino acids,

836
00:31:53.477 --> 00:31:55.333
that, when they're absent in the diet,

837
00:31:55.333 --> 00:31:57.658
it can result in depression and moodiness

838
00:31:57.658 --> 00:31:59.045
and things like that.

839
00:31:59.045 --> 00:32:01.210
It's got a fully array of B vitamins.

840
00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:03.695
Thiamin, niacin, riboflavin.

841
00:32:05.895 --> 00:32:08.336
So, not only the Vitamin C is there,

842
00:32:08.336 --> 00:32:10.501
which is great for the immune system.

843
00:32:10.501 --> 00:32:13.595
It's very important for the health of the skin,

844
00:32:13.595 --> 00:32:17.008
the hair, the fingernails.

845
00:32:17.008 --> 00:32:19.771
It's wonderful for cardiovascular support.

846
00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:21.669
The biggest killer in America.

847
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:23.621
And so, the list goes on and on.

848
00:32:23.621 --> 00:32:25.040
It's anti-inflammatory.

849
00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.821
What Vitamin C is about,

850
00:32:26.821 --> 00:32:29.285
and Linus Pauling did extraordinary work

851
00:32:29.285 --> 00:32:32.303
with the importance of Vitamin C.

852
00:32:32.303 --> 00:32:34.532
But now, we see another whole profile

853
00:32:34.532 --> 00:32:37.231
of bioflavinoids, and amino acids,

854
00:32:37.231 --> 00:32:40.015
and other vitamins and things in there,

855
00:32:40.015 --> 00:32:41.497
that really express themselves

856
00:32:41.497 --> 00:32:43.353
and create a biological terrain

857
00:32:43.353 --> 00:32:47.118
that helps the uptake of serotonin in the brain.

858
00:32:47.118 --> 00:32:49.070
So now, we're really just--
<v Regina>That's important.</v>

859
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:51.363
<v ->Adjusting the mood and the perception</v>

860
00:32:51.363 --> 00:32:53.710
of the world by people too.

861
00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:55.480
So, this fruit has become really,

862
00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:59.256
an astounding, surprising, wonderful,

863
00:32:59.256 --> 00:33:02.371
important gift from the Amazon right now.

864
00:33:02.371 --> 00:33:03.437
<v Regina>And you found a way to</v>

865
00:33:03.437 --> 00:33:05.155
make it available so that

866
00:33:05.155 --> 00:33:06.669
it really doesn't degenerate,

867
00:33:06.669 --> 00:33:08.386
it doesn't oxidize or anything.

868
00:33:08.386 --> 00:33:10.061
One thing I was curious about,

869
00:33:10.061 --> 00:33:11.917
not just that, but, I mean, you have

870
00:33:11.917 --> 00:33:15.373
so many rich products like this.

871
00:33:15.373 --> 00:33:16.535
This is just one.

872
00:33:16.535 --> 00:33:18.487
I just like the story of the plant

873
00:33:18.487 --> 00:33:20.972
and how it survives, really.

874
00:33:20.972 --> 00:33:22.455
And then the benefits of it.

875
00:33:22.455 --> 00:33:24.545
But, what about bringing them

876
00:33:24.545 --> 00:33:26.028
back into the country?

877
00:33:27.648 --> 00:33:30.242
When so many of the foods and supplements

878
00:33:30.242 --> 00:33:32.194
that are brought into this country

879
00:33:32.194 --> 00:33:33.634
are irradiated,

880
00:33:33.634 --> 00:33:35.905
how do you get around all of this?

881
00:33:35.905 --> 00:33:36.993
Or do you get around--

882
00:33:36.993 --> 00:33:37.953
I assume you do.

883
00:33:37.953 --> 00:33:39.756
<v ->Yeah, what we do, we insist on</v>

884
00:33:39.756 --> 00:33:43.521
a hand inspection of the herbs

885
00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:45.334
and the raw material that we bring up,

886
00:33:45.334 --> 00:33:47.659
so they're not irradiated

887
00:33:47.659 --> 00:33:49.910
and that sort of thing.

888
00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:53.483
And, so, if you've got a boatload of bananas,

889
00:33:53.483 --> 00:33:55.339
or food crops that come up,

890
00:33:55.339 --> 00:33:59.296
and you're insisting on a hand inspection,

891
00:33:59.296 --> 00:34:00.928
they can put it in a warehouse

892
00:34:00.928 --> 00:34:02.016
and say, "yeah, we'll get to it

893
00:34:02.016 --> 00:34:03.776
"in another three or four weeks."

894
00:34:03.776 --> 00:34:06.965
Five weeks or six weeks, if they're really busy.

895
00:34:06.965 --> 00:34:08.469
Well, if you got a boatload of bananas,

896
00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:10.303
you're not going to want to do that, right?

897
00:34:10.303 --> 00:34:11.210
Six weeks, you're going to have

898
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:12.650
a boatload of mush.

899
00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:14.015
So that's why the food crops,

900
00:34:14.015 --> 00:34:16.575
they just, they don't care.

901
00:34:16.575 --> 00:34:18.217
So that's why the food coming into the country

902
00:34:18.217 --> 00:34:20.660
is irradiated, because it's got to pass,

903
00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:22.558
they've got to get it in.

904
00:34:22.558 --> 00:34:23.774
For us, it's okay.

905
00:34:23.774 --> 00:34:25.513
It's just an inconvenience if they say,

906
00:34:25.513 --> 00:34:27.294
"okay, it's going to be five or six weeks."

907
00:34:27.294 --> 00:34:28.339
That's okay for us.

908
00:34:28.339 --> 00:34:29.715
We'll wait the five or six weeks

909
00:34:29.715 --> 00:34:31.454
and have the hand inspection done,

910
00:34:31.454 --> 00:34:34.664
so we can bring it in that way.

911
00:34:34.664 --> 00:34:38.216
And with the camu, we seal it up,

912
00:34:38.216 --> 00:34:41.576
so it's important because that will begin to,

913
00:34:41.576 --> 00:34:45.650
with the Vitamin C content, anyway,

914
00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:47.783
will begin to oxidize over time.

915
00:34:47.783 --> 00:34:50.684
So we take that material, we dry it,

916
00:34:50.684 --> 00:34:53.095
we have a warm air dryer,

917
00:34:53.095 --> 00:34:54.790
where we dry that fruit down,

918
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:56.700
and then we grind it into powder,

919
00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.598
and then it's sealed into

920
00:35:00.538 --> 00:35:02.578
like, five kilo bags there.

921
00:35:02.578 --> 00:35:04.572
So, it's triple-airtight sealed,

922
00:35:04.572 --> 00:35:05.970
and then we bring those up,

923
00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:07.378
and then we put those into

924
00:35:07.378 --> 00:35:12.305
one-gram airtight packets we call "fresh packs."

925
00:35:12.305 --> 00:35:14.854
So then, the fresh pack, it stays just like that,

926
00:35:14.854 --> 00:35:18.833
until it's time to open it and reintroduce it

927
00:35:18.833 --> 00:35:22.129
into its medium, which is water,

928
00:35:22.129 --> 00:35:23.750
reintroduced into water and

929
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:25.424
shaken up into a beverage.

930
00:35:25.424 --> 00:35:27.888
<v Regina>And can you talk about</v>

931
00:35:27.888 --> 00:35:30.395
the qualitative difference of having

932
00:35:30.395 --> 00:35:33.595
this form of Vitamin C in the body?

933
00:35:33.595 --> 00:35:35.504
Well, you already hit on it

934
00:35:35.504 --> 00:35:37.082
by looking at all the other nutrients

935
00:35:37.082 --> 00:35:39.653
that are present, compared to, say, ascorbic acid.

936
00:35:39.653 --> 00:35:40.997
White powder.

937
00:35:40.997 --> 00:35:41.765
<v ->That's it.</v>

938
00:35:41.765 --> 00:35:43.770
I mean, it's a totally different animal, you know?

939
00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:45.850
When you've got ascorbic acid,

940
00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:48.132
which is a synthetic Vitamin C,

941
00:35:48.132 --> 00:35:50.916
as opposed to a natural Vitamin C,

942
00:35:50.916 --> 00:35:55.097
that's surrounded by its naturally-occurring elements,

943
00:35:55.097 --> 00:35:56.996
the other bioflavinoid profiles,

944
00:35:56.996 --> 00:35:59.972
and the amino acids, and everything else,

945
00:35:59.972 --> 00:36:01.785
that really make it friendly to the body,

946
00:36:01.785 --> 00:36:04.430
absorbable by the body, usable by the body,

947
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:06.446
so you can express itself.

948
00:36:06.446 --> 00:36:07.747
That was the same thing as

949
00:36:07.747 --> 00:36:09.912
something that's real, and something

950
00:36:09.912 --> 00:36:14.648
that's synthetic and isolated.

951
00:36:14.648 --> 00:36:16.877
<v Regina>And isolated, and that's a really big point.</v>

952
00:36:16.877 --> 00:36:18.381
And that's often what happens

953
00:36:18.381 --> 00:36:20.728
in the allopathic medical model.

954
00:36:20.728 --> 00:36:21.869
Everything is isolated.

955
00:36:21.869 --> 00:36:24.909
And, in fact, a lot of the drugs that people take,

956
00:36:24.909 --> 00:36:26.903
pharmaceutical drugs that people take,

957
00:36:26.903 --> 00:36:29.826
are based on mimicking, or sourced,

958
00:36:29.826 --> 00:36:31.756
out of the Amazon, anyway, right?

959
00:36:31.756 --> 00:36:32.503
<v ->Yeah.</v>

960
00:36:32.503 --> 00:36:33.847
<v Regina>The original pattern for it.</v>

961
00:36:33.847 --> 00:36:35.681
<v ->Yeah, you're exactly right, yeah.</v>

962
00:36:35.681 --> 00:36:39.980
And it's estimated up to 25 to 30% are like that,

963
00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:42.156
where the original pattern, the original footprint,

964
00:36:42.156 --> 00:36:43.787
came from a plant,

965
00:36:43.787 --> 00:36:48.363
and then the model, or the drug model--

966
00:36:48.363 --> 00:36:50.219
it's a drug business, so their model

967
00:36:50.219 --> 00:36:55.219
is to isolate the specific active component of that,

968
00:36:55.669 --> 00:36:57.856
so they can patent that,

969
00:36:57.856 --> 00:37:00.714
and then you've got a synthetic isolate

970
00:37:00.714 --> 00:37:02.922
that's being sold,

971
00:37:02.922 --> 00:37:04.352
which is very, very different

972
00:37:04.352 --> 00:37:06.677
than the mother plant.

973
00:37:06.677 --> 00:37:08.725
And we see that happen very often now,

974
00:37:08.725 --> 00:37:11.487
where you've got a plant.

975
00:37:11.487 --> 00:37:15.807
For example, Sangre de Drago, for example.

976
00:37:15.807 --> 00:37:17.567
You know, the sap I talked about earlier.

977
00:37:17.567 --> 00:37:19.423
In addition to healing wounds,

978
00:37:19.423 --> 00:37:21.332
we find that, if you dry that sap,

979
00:37:21.332 --> 00:37:24.094
it's 90% pure proanthocyanidins.

980
00:37:24.094 --> 00:37:26.131
So, it's like, almost a pure antioxidant.

981
00:37:26.131 --> 00:37:28.478
It's also got very strong antiviral activity.

982
00:37:28.478 --> 00:37:29.918
There's a lot of research done

983
00:37:29.918 --> 00:37:34.846
by Shaman Pharmaceuticals on this plant.

984
00:37:34.846 --> 00:37:38.088
I think the world should be very thankful

985
00:37:38.088 --> 00:37:40.488
for Shaman Pharmaceutical, for investing,

986
00:37:40.488 --> 00:37:44.082
I think it's close to 70 million dollars, researching this,

987
00:37:44.082 --> 00:37:46.034
because they should--

988
00:37:46.034 --> 00:37:48.797
the idea was to make a herpes drug out of it.

989
00:37:48.797 --> 00:37:50.002
You know, a virus, because,

990
00:37:50.002 --> 00:37:53.415
very potently antiviral, and they saw what it did

991
00:37:53.415 --> 00:37:55.719
to the herpes virus, and other rare forms

992
00:37:55.719 --> 00:37:59.079
of lung virus, and on and on and on.

993
00:37:59.079 --> 00:38:00.497
So, they spent a lot of money.

994
00:38:00.497 --> 00:38:01.895
The problem was,

995
00:38:01.895 --> 00:38:06.001
that when they isolated the particular component

996
00:38:06.001 --> 00:38:08.230
that they thought was responsible

997
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:09.883
for that activity,

998
00:38:09.883 --> 00:38:12.923
as it went into second-phase clinical trials, and so on,

999
00:38:12.923 --> 00:38:14.363
it became more and more toxic.

1000
00:38:14.363 --> 00:38:17.680
So, eventually, they just had to abandon it.

1001
00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.933
But they showed great efficacy

1002
00:38:20.933 --> 00:38:22.811
of what the sap does.

1003
00:38:22.811 --> 00:38:25.157
But they're not in the sap business.

1004
00:38:25.157 --> 00:38:27.504
The drug companies are in the drug business,

1005
00:38:27.504 --> 00:38:29.498
so if they can't isolate it,

1006
00:38:29.498 --> 00:38:33.167
or it's not effective in that isolate form,

1007
00:38:33.167 --> 00:38:37.807
then they scrap it as a business project.

1008
00:38:37.807 --> 00:38:39.418
But they did great work

1009
00:38:39.418 --> 00:38:42.257
on showing the efficacy of the plants.

1010
00:38:43.297 --> 00:38:45.003
<v Regina>So, you're in the sap business.</v>

1011
00:38:45.003 --> 00:38:46.443
<v ->Exactly.
(both laughing)

1012
00:38:46.443 --> 00:38:48.797
<v Regina>Great, you get the whole enchilada, there.</v>

1013
00:38:48.797 --> 00:38:49.667
<v ->I think it's great.</v>

1014
00:38:49.667 --> 00:38:51.053
I love the sap.

1015
00:38:51.053 --> 00:38:53.474
Now, the difference in my business is,

1016
00:38:55.024 --> 00:38:58.490
is that we can't say, "this cures herpes."

1017
00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:00.932
Or, "this is really good for a virus."

1018
00:39:00.932 --> 00:39:02.212
You know, we talk about it

1019
00:39:02.212 --> 00:39:04.420
for its antioxidant activity,

1020
00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:07.502
and for its ability to regenerate

1021
00:39:07.502 --> 00:39:10.617
and help one express their life experience

1022
00:39:10.617 --> 00:39:11.971
as a more vital level,

1023
00:39:11.971 --> 00:39:13.312
which is exactly what it does.

1024
00:39:13.312 --> 00:39:14.496
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1025
00:39:14.496 --> 00:39:16.256
Let's expand the picture.

1026
00:39:16.256 --> 00:39:17.696
And this is also part of

1027
00:39:17.696 --> 00:39:19.434
your five undeniable truths,

1028
00:39:19.434 --> 00:39:20.831
but I wanted to expand it,

1029
00:39:20.831 --> 00:39:21.781
because you just mentioned

1030
00:39:21.781 --> 00:39:23.479
the word "isolation" a few times.

1031
00:39:23.479 --> 00:39:25.526
This whole subject of isolation

1032
00:39:25.526 --> 00:39:29.164
permeates our cultures in the Western world,

1033
00:39:29.164 --> 00:39:31.958
as people isolate themselves from each other.

1034
00:39:31.958 --> 00:39:35.787
You know, a condo for every person, so to speak.

1035
00:39:35.787 --> 00:39:38.902
And the same thing, by isolating nutrients

1036
00:39:38.902 --> 00:39:41.365
out of our plants, by growing crops

1037
00:39:41.365 --> 00:39:44.501
that are isolated only in the presence of each other.

1038
00:39:44.501 --> 00:39:48.053
What do you see, in terms of

1039
00:39:48.053 --> 00:39:49.749
your role and your part?

1040
00:39:49.749 --> 00:39:51.530
What's your vision for

1041
00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.971
essentially, overcoming this isolation

1042
00:39:54.971 --> 00:39:58.384
of a plant, of a species, of many species?

1043
00:39:58.384 --> 00:40:02.300
<v ->Well, on a larger scale,</v>

1044
00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.614
you're talking about the isolation.

1045
00:40:04.614 --> 00:40:05.958
People are becoming isolated.

1046
00:40:05.958 --> 00:40:07.451
Becoming isolated into the countries,

1047
00:40:07.451 --> 00:40:08.976
become isolated with languages,

1048
00:40:08.976 --> 00:40:12.784
become isolated in many different ways.

1049
00:40:12.784 --> 00:40:16.272
And the Amazon rain forest,

1050
00:40:16.272 --> 00:40:18.704
which is the largest concentration

1051
00:40:18.704 --> 00:40:20.656
of life energy on Earth,

1052
00:40:20.656 --> 00:40:23.162
with this huge gift of biodiversity,

1053
00:40:23.162 --> 00:40:25.370
that I think everyone should

1054
00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:27.386
have access to this,

1055
00:40:27.386 --> 00:40:30.042
everybody in our species.

1056
00:40:30.042 --> 00:40:34.579
And the value of the Amazon rain forest,

1057
00:40:34.579 --> 00:40:37.151
now, for the most part, is being determined

1058
00:40:37.151 --> 00:40:39.892
by its other natural resources there.

1059
00:40:39.892 --> 00:40:42.836
You know, the oil in the Amazon rain forest,

1060
00:40:42.836 --> 00:40:46.367
the minerals in the rain forest,

1061
00:40:46.367 --> 00:40:47.764
the lumber in the rain forest.

1062
00:40:47.764 --> 00:40:50.334
It's so rich in so many resources,

1063
00:40:50.334 --> 00:40:52.702
that that's the cause of its deforestation,

1064
00:40:52.702 --> 00:40:54.121
people going after that.

1065
00:40:54.121 --> 00:40:56.147
The biggest deforester now is soybeans.

1066
00:40:56.147 --> 00:40:58.163
So what I see my vision is,

1067
00:40:58.163 --> 00:41:00.200
what I'm very optimistic about,

1068
00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.088
is people are beginning to recognize,

1069
00:41:02.088 --> 00:41:04.793
a.) that our species are dying

1070
00:41:04.793 --> 00:41:07.470
of degenerative disease,

1071
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:09.486
which I think is entirely unnecessary,

1072
00:41:09.486 --> 00:41:11.363
it just simply doesn't have to be,

1073
00:41:11.363 --> 00:41:13.315
because of what we know now,

1074
00:41:13.315 --> 00:41:15.363
from the plants that are in the Amazon.

1075
00:41:15.363 --> 00:41:18.285
So, it redirects a different value,

1076
00:41:18.285 --> 00:41:22.744
a stature, to a living Amazon rain forest,

1077
00:41:22.744 --> 00:41:25.346
when we recognize the value of what's there

1078
00:41:25.346 --> 00:41:27.735
from the standpoint of the chemistry,

1079
00:41:27.735 --> 00:41:29.037
the nutrition, the information,

1080
00:41:29.037 --> 00:41:31.404
they can change our life experience.

1081
00:41:31.404 --> 00:41:32.332
They can change the course

1082
00:41:32.332 --> 00:41:34.242
of degenerative disease.

1083
00:41:34.242 --> 00:41:38.764
Now, as that value is recreated,

1084
00:41:38.764 --> 00:41:41.644
what we're doing, specifically,

1085
00:41:41.644 --> 00:41:43.852
is helping indigenous communities get rights

1086
00:41:43.852 --> 00:41:46.316
and titles and deeds to land there.

1087
00:41:46.316 --> 00:41:51.051
So, normally, where the titles and deeds start,

1088
00:41:51.051 --> 00:41:53.248
the deforestation ends.

1089
00:41:53.248 --> 00:41:56.299
Because they will protect their land.

1090
00:41:56.299 --> 00:41:58.369
<v Regina>And you're a big part of this right now.</v>

1091
00:41:58.369 --> 00:42:00.427
<v ->Well, we're doing everything we can,</v>

1092
00:42:00.427 --> 00:42:03.403
and we've got a great model that's working,

1093
00:42:05.303 --> 00:42:08.859
and I would like to see other people

1094
00:42:08.859 --> 00:42:11.899
using the same specific model,

1095
00:42:11.899 --> 00:42:13.712
but we're at the front end

1096
00:42:13.712 --> 00:42:15.664
of something that is expanding

1097
00:42:15.664 --> 00:42:17.381
that people do understand.

1098
00:42:17.381 --> 00:42:18.789
And I really believe this is

1099
00:42:18.789 --> 00:42:20.560
a big part of the future.

1100
00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:24.025
So, as these indigenous communities are re-empowered,

1101
00:42:24.025 --> 00:42:27.501
this is a whole different understanding.

1102
00:42:28.281 --> 00:42:29.739
The analogy I would use would be,

1103
00:42:29.739 --> 00:42:31.201
like, the Mid East.

1104
00:42:31.201 --> 00:42:35.289
Say, the Mid East 50, 60, 70 years ago.

1105
00:42:36.269 --> 00:42:37.681
The United Arab Emirates,

1106
00:42:38.941 --> 00:42:42.114
and Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran.

1107
00:42:42.114 --> 00:42:44.951
The oil producing nations of the world.

1108
00:42:44.951 --> 00:42:47.148
Well, as oil became, there's a bigger and bigger

1109
00:42:47.148 --> 00:42:49.356
demand for oil, you know,

1110
00:42:49.356 --> 00:42:52.172
suddenly, these countries--

1111
00:42:52.172 --> 00:42:54.262
there's a reassessment of value

1112
00:42:54.262 --> 00:42:55.787
to these countries.

1113
00:42:55.787 --> 00:42:58.902
A reassessment of resources flowing to these countries.

1114
00:42:58.902 --> 00:43:02.784
So, after the Arab oil embargo in the 70s,

1115
00:43:02.784 --> 00:43:04.640
suddenly, these countries

1116
00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.125
had a lot more stature in the world,

1117
00:43:07.125 --> 00:43:08.704
a lot more presence in the world,

1118
00:43:08.704 --> 00:43:10.186
because of the resources there

1119
00:43:10.186 --> 00:43:12.714
the rest of the world was hungry for.

1120
00:43:12.714 --> 00:43:15.871
And we see that continuing to go now.

1121
00:43:15.871 --> 00:43:18.314
The price of oil is 60, 70 dollars.

1122
00:43:18.314 --> 00:43:19.871
<v Regina>Seller's market.</v>

1123
00:43:19.871 --> 00:43:21.669
<v ->Now we're seeing, I think,</v>

1124
00:43:21.669 --> 00:43:24.000
a rebirth of that in the Amazon.

1125
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.503
And I say rebirth because

1126
00:43:25.503 --> 00:43:27.178
almost no one recognizes it

1127
00:43:27.178 --> 00:43:29.567
the way I'm explaining it now,

1128
00:43:29.567 --> 00:43:31.103
but a reassignment of value.

1129
00:43:31.103 --> 00:43:32.308
Because, what's more important,

1130
00:43:32.308 --> 00:43:34.378
putting gasoline in your tank,

1131
00:43:34.378 --> 00:43:36.511
or, if you really realize, that,

1132
00:43:36.511 --> 00:43:37.908
"gee, I don't have to suffer from

1133
00:43:37.908 --> 00:43:40.511
"all these degenerative diseases?"

1134
00:43:40.511 --> 00:43:43.337
That becomes much more important.

1135
00:43:43.337 --> 00:43:45.982
And so, as that consciousness shifts,

1136
00:43:45.982 --> 00:43:47.497
and the understanding, and the information,

1137
00:43:47.497 --> 00:43:48.958
and the realization shifts,

1138
00:43:48.958 --> 00:43:51.304
then there's a much greater value

1139
00:43:51.304 --> 00:43:53.000
for that living rain forest,

1140
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.579
and the empowerment

1141
00:43:54.579 --> 00:43:57.160
is going to the indigenous communities.

1142
00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.496
So the indigenous communities there,

1143
00:43:59.496 --> 00:44:00.797
I'm already seeing,

1144
00:44:00.797 --> 00:44:05.256
when I'm working with chiefs and Curanderos,

1145
00:44:05.256 --> 00:44:07.997
they're asking me, and this is recent,

1146
00:44:07.997 --> 00:44:10.855
to connect with other chiefs and Curanderos

1147
00:44:10.855 --> 00:44:14.194
from other native peoples.

1148
00:44:14.194 --> 00:44:17.564
For example, the native peoples in the U.S.

1149
00:44:17.564 --> 00:44:19.868
There is that communication

1150
00:44:19.868 --> 00:44:21.553
that's beginning to spread.

1151
00:44:22.903 --> 00:44:25.223
We're able to put into these communities,

1152
00:44:25.223 --> 00:44:28.434
for example, solar powered shortwave radios,

1153
00:44:28.434 --> 00:44:30.076
so they're able to communicate

1154
00:44:30.076 --> 00:44:31.847
between the communities

1155
00:44:31.847 --> 00:44:35.495
with a shortwave radio that's run by solar power,

1156
00:44:35.495 --> 00:44:37.116
and communicate with our base

1157
00:44:37.116 --> 00:44:39.324
in Yarinacocha the same way.

1158
00:44:39.324 --> 00:44:40.390
And so, once you've got

1159
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:44.561
that communication going on,

1160
00:44:44.561 --> 00:44:46.511
with laptops and things,

1161
00:44:46.511 --> 00:44:49.101
you get solar panels in a laptop,

1162
00:44:49.101 --> 00:44:52.493
and you can tie into the world's database

1163
00:44:52.493 --> 00:44:54.008
and still be living

1164
00:44:56.138 --> 00:44:58.925
hundreds of miles deep in the Amazon rain forest.

1165
00:44:58.925 --> 00:45:00.899
So, if you've got the information there,

1166
00:45:00.899 --> 00:45:02.691
plus, you've got the autonomy

1167
00:45:02.691 --> 00:45:05.293
of still living in a natural environment.

1168
00:45:05.293 --> 00:45:06.850
<v Regina>I mean, how are you helping them protect this?</v>

1169
00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:08.375
How do you assist them in

1170
00:45:08.375 --> 00:45:10.765
gaining the deeds to their property?

1171
00:45:10.765 --> 00:45:13.630
<v ->Well, you know, it's a process that started</v>

1172
00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:18.031
probably seven, eight years ago,

1173
00:45:18.031 --> 00:45:20.143
when a particular community

1174
00:45:20.143 --> 00:45:22.490
that we had a really good relationship with

1175
00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:26.756
came to us, and the chief came and said,

1176
00:45:26.756 --> 00:45:30.724
"there's lumber companies on our land here.

1177
00:45:30.724 --> 00:45:32.494
"And they're cutting the trees down.

1178
00:45:32.494 --> 00:45:34.862
"Can you help us?"

1179
00:45:34.862 --> 00:45:37.369
And we said, "yeah, we will help you."

1180
00:45:37.369 --> 00:45:41.134
So I said, "let's just drive them off.

1181
00:45:41.134 --> 00:45:44.959
I said, "so, how big is your land?"

1182
00:45:44.959 --> 00:45:46.687
And then it became clear

1183
00:45:46.687 --> 00:45:49.535
that they really didn't have any land.

1184
00:45:49.535 --> 00:45:51.465
They've just been living there forever.

1185
00:45:51.465 --> 00:45:52.692
And what they called their land,

1186
00:45:52.692 --> 00:45:55.508
there wasn't a title or a deed or anything to it.

1187
00:45:55.508 --> 00:45:56.905
So, we go to the Peruvian government

1188
00:45:56.905 --> 00:45:58.944
and say we'd like to get these some titles

1189
00:45:58.944 --> 00:46:00.799
and deeds to this land,

1190
00:46:00.799 --> 00:46:02.175
and they say, "what land?"

1191
00:46:02.175 --> 00:46:03.541
There's no map.

1192
00:46:03.541 --> 00:46:04.703
So the first thing that you have to do

1193
00:46:04.703 --> 00:46:06.282
is survey it.

1194
00:46:06.282 --> 00:46:08.351
So, you get a surveying crew to survey it,

1195
00:46:08.351 --> 00:46:10.644
and then you've got a definition

1196
00:46:10.644 --> 00:46:12.767
on what it is.

1197
00:46:12.767 --> 00:46:14.527
And that's the beginning of the process.

1198
00:46:14.527 --> 00:46:18.121
We get surveyors, engineers, and attorneys.

1199
00:46:18.121 --> 00:46:19.380
So you go through this process

1200
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.798
where you get the rights to the land

1201
00:46:20.798 --> 00:46:22.003
to be living there.

1202
00:46:22.003 --> 00:46:23.113
And ultimately, you get an actual

1203
00:46:23.113 --> 00:46:26.558
finished title and deed in the name of the community.

1204
00:46:26.558 --> 00:46:30.312
So, it was kind of a pioneering experience

1205
00:46:30.312 --> 00:46:32.125
to go through that process.

1206
00:46:32.125 --> 00:46:34.112
But, when it was done,

1207
00:46:37.102 --> 00:46:38.502
it changes the world.

1208
00:46:38.502 --> 00:46:39.734
It changes the future.

1209
00:46:39.734 --> 00:46:41.425
There's 200 people in this community,

1210
00:46:41.425 --> 00:46:43.799
and now they've got 13,000 acres of land.

1211
00:46:43.799 --> 00:46:46.263
It changes everything.
<v Regina>That's fabulous.</v>

1212
00:46:46.263 --> 00:46:48.556
<v ->And so then that created a model</v>

1213
00:46:48.556 --> 00:46:51.436
that we're replicating.

1214
00:46:51.436 --> 00:46:53.388
<v Regina>That, in and of itself,</v>

1215
00:46:53.388 --> 00:46:54.753
was absolutely incredible.

1216
00:46:54.753 --> 00:46:57.175
So, as we wrap this up,

1217
00:46:57.175 --> 00:46:58.679
what kind of vision--

1218
00:46:58.679 --> 00:47:00.785
I mean, you've got your,

1219
00:47:00.785 --> 00:47:02.935
you're connecting the public at large now,

1220
00:47:02.935 --> 00:47:05.505
not just doctor's offices, but the public at large,

1221
00:47:05.505 --> 00:47:06.849
with these herbs, so they can start

1222
00:47:06.849 --> 00:47:08.385
making decisions and taking this

1223
00:47:08.385 --> 00:47:10.177
kind of responsibility for their health

1224
00:47:10.177 --> 00:47:11.638
into their own hands.

1225
00:47:11.638 --> 00:47:14.422
You're helping the tribes protect their land,

1226
00:47:14.422 --> 00:47:15.905
so that they have future revenues

1227
00:47:15.905 --> 00:47:17.483
for future generations.

1228
00:47:17.483 --> 00:47:19.211
Can we assume that the knowledge

1229
00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:20.758
of the elders in medicine men

1230
00:47:20.758 --> 00:47:22.699
is being passed on

1231
00:47:22.699 --> 00:47:25.131
to the younger generation still?

1232
00:47:25.131 --> 00:47:26.603
Is that happening?

1233
00:47:26.603 --> 00:47:30.016
<v ->In some cases, that is happening.</v>

1234
00:47:30.016 --> 00:47:32.170
In other cases, it isn't.

1235
00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:33.610
It's being lost.

1236
00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:37.066
As there's kind of an integration

1237
00:47:37.066 --> 00:47:38.948
of these communities,

1238
00:47:40.588 --> 00:47:42.880
as the cities kind of spread,

1239
00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:46.673
the kids growing up in some of these communities,

1240
00:47:46.673 --> 00:47:49.553
like kids anywhere, they grow up.

1241
00:47:49.553 --> 00:47:52.380
They become teenagers, and they get restless,

1242
00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:54.353
and so they're looking to go somewhere.

1243
00:47:54.353 --> 00:47:55.398
And, as you know, there's another

1244
00:47:55.398 --> 00:47:56.998
town, or place to go.

1245
00:47:56.998 --> 00:47:59.505
They're kind of bailing out.

1246
00:47:59.505 --> 00:48:01.158
The interesting thing that we see

1247
00:48:01.158 --> 00:48:03.824
is that when we're in that community

1248
00:48:03.824 --> 00:48:05.659
and we're showing value

1249
00:48:05.659 --> 00:48:09.189
to the knowledge of the plants,

1250
00:48:09.189 --> 00:48:12.229
then that's something totally different.

1251
00:48:12.229 --> 00:48:14.512
So, now the teenagers, the other people,

1252
00:48:14.512 --> 00:48:15.696
the young people in the community,

1253
00:48:15.696 --> 00:48:18.298
recognize that someone from the outside

1254
00:48:18.298 --> 00:48:20.175
recognizes value in this,

1255
00:48:20.175 --> 00:48:21.871
so that instills a different valuation

1256
00:48:21.871 --> 00:48:24.122
in their mind for it.

1257
00:48:24.122 --> 00:48:28.932
So, we're seeing a rekindling

1258
00:48:28.932 --> 00:48:31.439
of the interest there,

1259
00:48:31.439 --> 00:48:33.593
in many cases.

1260
00:48:33.593 --> 00:48:34.788
But in other cases,

1261
00:48:34.788 --> 00:48:37.102
when a medicine man dies,

1262
00:48:37.102 --> 00:48:40.398
a lot of information is lost.

1263
00:48:40.398 --> 00:48:43.000
<v Regina>And what's your part in continuing this?</v>

1264
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.347
<v ->Well, obviously, we're trying to,</v>

1265
00:48:45.347 --> 00:48:49.080
like sponges, suck up all the information we can

1266
00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:54.008
from these Curanderos and Chaman,

1267
00:48:54.008 --> 00:48:55.821
and anyone who has information

1268
00:48:55.821 --> 00:48:59.234
about these plants and what their benefits are,

1269
00:48:59.234 --> 00:49:02.530
and then we're re-sharing it with the community.

1270
00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:05.292
Obviously, we're creating products

1271
00:49:05.292 --> 00:49:08.610
and kind of an interesting story,

1272
00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:10.796
because we've got, for example,

1273
00:49:10.796 --> 00:49:13.676
there's plants that grow in one area of Peru

1274
00:49:13.676 --> 00:49:17.686
that are traditionally used for liver and kidney health,

1275
00:49:17.686 --> 00:49:20.011
and there are plants that are growing in Brazil

1276
00:49:20.011 --> 00:49:23.777
that are used for liver and kidney health,

1277
00:49:23.777 --> 00:49:26.187
that don't grow, that aren't indigenous to this area.

1278
00:49:26.187 --> 00:49:28.907
So, if we take those plants from Brazil

1279
00:49:28.907 --> 00:49:32.320
and the plants from Peru, thousands of miles away,

1280
00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:33.600
and combine them,

1281
00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:35.616
sometimes that's a better formula,

1282
00:49:35.616 --> 00:49:36.938
sometimes it's not.

1283
00:49:36.938 --> 00:49:39.424
We've got some very sophisticated technology

1284
00:49:39.424 --> 00:49:41.375
we use to determine that.

1285
00:49:41.375 --> 00:49:43.210
But once we have that done,

1286
00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:45.109
and we refine that, and process it,

1287
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:47.623
and concentrate it, and do our

1288
00:49:47.623 --> 00:49:50.037
special techniques with it,

1289
00:49:50.037 --> 00:49:53.077
and have it in a usable, convenient form,

1290
00:49:53.077 --> 00:49:55.008
and I'm carrying that in my suitcase

1291
00:49:55.008 --> 00:49:57.695
back upriver, and I'm eating that.

1292
00:49:57.695 --> 00:49:59.743
In the beginning, I didn't recognize it,

1293
00:49:59.743 --> 00:50:02.943
because they have wild plants growing there.

1294
00:50:02.943 --> 00:50:05.428
They would respond to the convenience of this

1295
00:50:05.428 --> 00:50:08.521
that has in it the other plants

1296
00:50:08.521 --> 00:50:10.463
from other parts of the rain forest,

1297
00:50:10.463 --> 00:50:12.020
but they do.

1298
00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:14.526
And so now, we find ourselves taking back,

1299
00:50:14.526 --> 00:50:17.598
not only taking the information that they know,

1300
00:50:17.598 --> 00:50:19.593
but taking the information

1301
00:50:19.593 --> 00:50:20.990
that we've discovered from the other

1302
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:22.584
areas of the rain forest, too,

1303
00:50:22.584 --> 00:50:24.696
and the technology that we have

1304
00:50:24.696 --> 00:50:27.146
to create these specific formulas,

1305
00:50:27.146 --> 00:50:29.812
and kind of upgrading all that, if you will,

1306
00:50:29.812 --> 00:50:32.276
and taking it back, that they really

1307
00:50:32.276 --> 00:50:34.462
respond to that material.

1308
00:50:34.462 --> 00:50:37.170
That they're really excited about having that.

1309
00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:40.480
So, that's part of it.

1310
00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:41.604
<v Regina>That's doing your part.</v>

1311
00:50:41.604 --> 00:50:42.809
That's doing your part.

1312
00:50:42.809 --> 00:50:44.644
And you've been there over 300 times,

1313
00:50:44.644 --> 00:50:46.734
and I certainly hope you're going to be there

1314
00:50:46.734 --> 00:50:49.177
another 300 times or more,

1315
00:50:49.177 --> 00:50:51.982
as you continue your discoveries.

1316
00:50:51.982 --> 00:50:54.905
Any final thoughts before you sign off?

1317
00:50:54.905 --> 00:50:55.928
Because I know we're just about

1318
00:50:55.928 --> 00:50:57.582
at our hour right now.

1319
00:50:57.582 --> 00:50:58.648
<v ->Well, you know, the role,</v>

1320
00:50:58.648 --> 00:51:00.600
asking about the role that we do,

1321
00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:03.619
one of the roles, and the way we envision that

1322
00:51:03.619 --> 00:51:07.544
is, really, supporting them

1323
00:51:07.544 --> 00:51:10.680
in however they would like to be supported.

1324
00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:14.690
Instead of carrying our vision of what we think

1325
00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:16.717
that would be good for them,

1326
00:51:16.717 --> 00:51:19.244
whatever that is, it's really about

1327
00:51:19.244 --> 00:51:21.538
empowering them and whatever

1328
00:51:21.538 --> 00:51:23.543
they would like to do.

1329
00:51:23.543 --> 00:51:25.399
And it's not always necessarily a thing

1330
00:51:25.399 --> 00:51:27.457
that we think that it might be.

1331
00:51:27.457 --> 00:51:28.396
But they're human beings.

1332
00:51:28.396 --> 00:51:30.337
They make up their own mind.

1333
00:51:30.337 --> 00:51:32.705
And our role is to empower them

1334
00:51:32.705 --> 00:51:36.513
with the future that they envision of themselves.

1335
00:51:36.513 --> 00:51:38.304
And our bigger role, we believe,

1336
00:51:38.304 --> 00:51:40.235
in doing that, and then helping bring

1337
00:51:40.235 --> 00:51:43.136
and manifest these important botanicals

1338
00:51:43.136 --> 00:51:46.176
for the individual and planetary health,

1339
00:51:46.176 --> 00:51:49.354
it's really just about making the world a better place.

1340
00:51:49.354 --> 00:51:51.210
<v Regina>Well, thank you, personally,</v>

1341
00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:52.512
and for all of us.

1342
00:51:52.512 --> 00:51:54.559
For putting decades of your time and energy

1343
00:51:54.559 --> 00:51:56.417
and passion into this.

1344
00:51:56.417 --> 00:51:57.267
Thank you.

1345
00:51:57.267 --> 00:51:58.939
And thank you for your time.

1346
00:51:58.939 --> 00:52:01.184
<v ->Pleasure.</v>

1347
00:52:02.491 --> 00:52:03.888
<v ->There's no question in my mind</v>

1348
00:52:03.888 --> 00:52:05.606
that consuming foods and supplements

1349
00:52:05.606 --> 00:52:08.304
with these levels of life force and supernutrients

1350
00:52:08.304 --> 00:52:10.181
are going to be absolutely necessary

1351
00:52:10.181 --> 00:52:11.429
for the health of our species

1352
00:52:11.429 --> 00:52:12.784
in the times ahead.

1353
00:52:12.784 --> 00:52:15.013

of this circle of benefit,

1358
00:52:21.845 --> 00:52:23.485
or sustainable economic model.

1359
00:52:23.485 --> 00:52:25.766
We hope you see the value in it, too.

1360
00:52:25.766 --> 00:52:28.437
Until next time, thanks for watching.
