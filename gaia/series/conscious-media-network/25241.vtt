(slow paced inspirational music)

2
00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.594
<v ->A book that profoundly affected me several years ago</v>

3
00:00:15.594 --> 00:00:17.951
was "Confessions of an Economic Hit Man."

4
00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:20.853
It was then that I began understanding how global finance

5
00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:23.731
and political systems work, or actually don't work.

6
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:25.727
The author, John Perkins, has written

7
00:00:25.727 --> 00:00:28.085
another book since then titled, "Hoodwinked."

8
00:00:28.085 --> 00:00:30.258
"Hoodwinked" takes us through the folly of allowing

9
00:00:30.258 --> 00:00:32.438
our world to be governed by corporations,

10
00:00:32.438 --> 00:00:35.051
but also speaks to the solutions.

11
00:00:35.051 --> 00:00:40.049 line:15% 
(slow paced inspirational music)

12
00:00:48.177 --> 00:00:50.108
I'm so glad we had a chance to meet today.

13
00:00:50.108 --> 00:00:52.110
We both had to come from other places

14
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.549
and your book has had, the first book,

15
00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:56.267
which you're on the sixth anniversary

16
00:00:56.267 --> 00:00:58.339
of "Confessions of an Economic Hit Man,"

17
00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.148
just a few days past that, has had

18
00:01:00.148 --> 00:01:03.572
such an incredible impact on people around the world.

19
00:01:03.572 --> 00:01:06.795
And, we were talking off camera, so many people say

20
00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:09.281
that was such a brave thing for you to do,

21
00:01:09.281 --> 00:01:12.886
and I think that's what is really so enthralling

22
00:01:12.886 --> 00:01:15.156
to all of us that haven't been in your position

23
00:01:15.156 --> 00:01:17.065
is people in that position rarely come forward

24
00:01:17.065 --> 00:01:19.670
and speak about it and give us an inside view.

25
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.711
So, you've had a lot of time to think about what happened

26
00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:24.642
in the past but let's start with that

27
00:01:24.642 --> 00:01:28.881
and what your life as an economic hit man entailed.

28
00:01:29.772 --> 00:01:31.788
<v ->Well, you know, when I was an economic hit man,</v>

29
00:01:31.788 --> 00:01:33.718
I was traveling all over the world.

30
00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:36.001
Basically, any country that had resources

31
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:39.392
that our corporations coveted, I or other economic hit men,

32
00:01:39.392 --> 00:01:42.847
would visit and we'd end up arranging

33
00:01:42.847 --> 00:01:46.085
a huge loan to that country from the World Bank

34
00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:48.357
or one of its sister organizations.

35
00:01:48.357 --> 00:01:50.384
But the money never actually went to the country,

36
00:01:50.384 --> 00:01:52.549
instead it would go to our own corporations

37
00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.841
to build infrastructure projects in that country,

38
00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:57.402
power plants, industrial parks, highways, ports,

39
00:01:57.402 --> 00:02:00.954
things that would benefit a few of the very wealthy families

40
00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:03.833
in that country, as well as our corporations,

41
00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:05.753
but not the majority of the people,

42
00:02:05.753 --> 00:02:07.311
who were too poor to buy electricity

43
00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:09.363
or drive cars on the highways or use ports,

44
00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:11.752
and industrial parks don't hire many people.

45
00:02:11.752 --> 00:02:15.090
And yet they would be left holding a massive debt

46
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.483
that they couldn't repay, so at some point,

47
00:02:18.483 --> 00:02:19.996
we'd go back to the country and say,

48
00:02:19.996 --> 00:02:21.909
hey since you can't pay your debts,

49
00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.304
give us your resources real cheap, like oil.

50
00:02:24.304 --> 00:02:26.512
Sell us your oil, real cheap, to our oil companies

51
00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:28.762
without any environmental restrictions

52
00:02:28.762 --> 00:02:32.613
or allow us to build a military base on your soil

53
00:02:32.613 --> 00:02:35.780
or vote with us on the next critical United Nations vote.

54
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.563
And in the few cases when we fail,

55
00:02:38.563 --> 00:02:41.775
and I talk in my books about how I fail with Jaime Roldós,

56
00:02:41.775 --> 00:02:44.462
democratically elected President of Ecuador,

57
00:02:44.462 --> 00:02:46.222
and Omar Torrijos of Panama,

58
00:02:46.222 --> 00:02:47.716
wasn't able to corrupt these men.

59
00:02:47.716 --> 00:02:49.175
They had too much integrity.

60
00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:51.366
When that happens, then the jackals go in,

61
00:02:51.366 --> 00:02:53.223
and they either overthrow governments

62
00:02:53.223 --> 00:02:56.732
or assassinate their leaders, both Roldós and Torrijos

63
00:02:56.732 --> 00:03:00.987
were assassinated because I couldn't bring them around.

64
00:03:00.987 --> 00:03:02.310
<v ->This weighed heavily on you.</v>

65
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.268
<v ->Weighed very heavily on me, and incidentally, recently,</v>

66
00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:08.893
we've seen something similar happen to Zelaya in Honduras,

67
00:03:08.893 --> 00:03:10.748
President Zelaya who was overthrown,

68
00:03:10.748 --> 00:03:13.916
and an attempt to overthrow President Correa of Ecuador,

69
00:03:13.916 --> 00:03:18.452
that attempt failed, CIA attempted both cases.

70
00:03:18.452 --> 00:03:21.240
In the few instances when we fail,

71
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.395
in the end the jackals also fail,

72
00:03:23.395 --> 00:03:24.977
then the military goes in and that's

73
00:03:24.977 --> 00:03:26.153
what happened with Saddam Hussein.

74
00:03:26.153 --> 00:03:27.429
<v ->So were you first or second line,</v>

75
00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:29.498
are you the first one in to try to essentially

76
00:03:29.498 --> 00:03:31.725
offer a deal they might not be able to refuse?

77
00:03:31.725 --> 00:03:34.626
<v ->Yes, I'm the first in and the idea being</v>

78
00:03:34.626 --> 00:03:37.642
that very inexpensively we can take over a country

79
00:03:37.642 --> 00:03:40.356
and its resources, we can basically bring it into our

80
00:03:40.356 --> 00:03:45.356
secret empire simply by this way of manipulating finances

81
00:03:45.361 --> 00:03:48.637
and economics and getting the country under our control.

82
00:03:48.637 --> 00:03:52.306
The old system of conquering other lands is

83
00:03:52.306 --> 00:03:55.197
very expensive, and very dangerous actually,

84
00:03:55.197 --> 00:03:58.616
and so if you can do it this more subtle way,

85
00:03:58.616 --> 00:04:00.768
the United States discovered back in the fifties,

86
00:04:00.768 --> 00:04:03.567
that this was a much easier, safer, less expensive

87
00:04:03.567 --> 00:04:06.939
way to take over other countries.

88
00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:09.051
<v ->Devastating results, nonetheless of</v>

89
00:04:09.051 --> 00:04:11.252
course and now we're paying for it.

90
00:04:11.252 --> 00:04:13.697
The implications of some of what's happening economically

91
00:04:13.697 --> 00:04:16.460
in these times is very directly related to the times

92
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.390
you were doing some of what you were doing and

93
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.805
we'll get to that because economics is at the core of it.

94
00:04:20.805 --> 00:04:23.973
I love your new book, "Hoodwinked," because you're really

95
00:04:23.973 --> 00:04:28.965
getting to the core of systemic philosophies economically,

96
00:04:28.965 --> 00:04:30.980
that have put us in real jeopardy

97
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.937
as not just the United States,

98
00:04:32.937 --> 00:04:36.862
but has put the entire globe in jeopardy economically

99
00:04:36.862 --> 00:04:38.952
and we're watching the dollar and the euro devalue

100
00:04:38.952 --> 00:04:41.614
by the minute as we're sitting here as a matter of fact.

101
00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:44.920
Let's talk about, do you want to do a little bit of

102
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.406
a background on Keynes versus Friedman

103
00:04:47.406 --> 00:04:49.443
and what this means to us, why this is important,

104
00:04:49.443 --> 00:04:51.440
why these names and these philosophies

105
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.861
on economics are so important today.

106
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:56.230
<v ->Well, perhaps the starting point would be to say that what</v>

107
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.823
we've created is a failure, from an economics standpoint.

108
00:04:59.823 --> 00:05:01.680
So the system we have in the world today,

109
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.454
where less than five percent of us live in the United States

110
00:05:04.454 --> 00:05:08.124
and consume more than 25% of the world's resources,

111
00:05:08.124 --> 00:05:11.815
and roughly half the world lives on the verge of starvation,

112
00:05:11.815 --> 00:05:15.674
or actually starving, that's a failure, it's not a model.

113
00:05:15.674 --> 00:05:19.249
You can't replicate this system in India or Africa

114
00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:21.186
or Latin America, it's not a model, it's a failure.

115
00:05:21.186 --> 00:05:22.872
We have to come up with something better.

116
00:05:22.872 --> 00:05:27.871
And really the basis for that failure is when we switch from

117
00:05:27.871 --> 00:05:32.126
Keynesian economics to Milton Friedman economics,

118
00:05:32.126 --> 00:05:33.716
and that was happening in the '70s

119
00:05:33.716 --> 00:05:36.094
when I was an economic hit man it was gradual,

120
00:05:36.094 --> 00:05:38.346
but it really took off in 1980

121
00:05:38.346 --> 00:05:40.329
when Ronald Reagan became President,

122
00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:43.433
totally embraced Milton Friedman's form of economics,

123
00:05:43.433 --> 00:05:46.111
at the same time, Margaret Thatcher of England,

124
00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:47.551
Oddsson of Iceland, and many other

125
00:05:47.551 --> 00:05:49.934
world leaders embraced Friedman,

126
00:05:49.934 --> 00:05:52.793
and every President of the United States

127
00:05:52.793 --> 00:05:54.532
has embraced Friedman ever since,

128
00:05:54.532 --> 00:05:56.261
Democrat and Republican alike.

129
00:05:56.261 --> 00:05:57.605
<v ->Can you give us a thumbnail sketch</v>

130
00:05:57.605 --> 00:05:59.093
of what the two different thoughts,

131
00:05:59.093 --> 00:06:00.672
the two different philosophies are,

132
00:06:00.672 --> 00:06:02.236
so we see what you're talking about here?

133
00:06:02.236 --> 00:06:03.790
<v ->I don't want to make John Maynard Keynes</v>

134
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.069
out to be some sort of an angel.

135
00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:07.877
He wasn't, his form of capitalism could be,

136
00:06:07.877 --> 00:06:10.017
in its own way, brutal, but it had

137
00:06:10.017 --> 00:06:12.277
a great deal of compassion in it, too.

138
00:06:12.277 --> 00:06:14.443
I grew up with that system when I was at business school,

139
00:06:14.443 --> 00:06:17.857
which basically said that a corporation and its CEO

140
00:06:17.857 --> 00:06:21.669
had a responsibility not just to stockholders

141
00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:25.414
but to the consumers, to the employees of the company,

142
00:06:25.414 --> 00:06:26.822
to the suppliers of the company,

143
00:06:26.822 --> 00:06:29.875
and especially to the community where the company's located

144
00:06:29.875 --> 00:06:32.403
and where it does its business, where it sells things.

145
00:06:32.403 --> 00:06:34.769
This is a responsibility and the CEO

146
00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:36.508
shouldn't make a heck of a lot of money.

147
00:06:36.508 --> 00:06:39.035
It should get a good living out of this, well rewarded,

148
00:06:39.035 --> 00:06:43.196
but not windfall profits, and that all changed.

149
00:06:43.196 --> 00:06:46.470
When Milton Friedman's form of economics came into being,

150
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.278
the driving force behind it is the idea that

151
00:06:50.278 --> 00:06:54.716
the only responsibility of business is to maximize profits,

152
00:06:54.716 --> 00:06:57.350
regardless of the social and environmental cost.

153
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.911
Keynes didn't say that at all.

154
00:06:59.911 --> 00:07:04.899
And a second premise of Friedman economics is that

155
00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:06.964
businesses shouldn't be regulated

156
00:07:06.964 --> 00:07:09.843
because regulations get in the way of making profits.

157
00:07:09.843 --> 00:07:12.980
And third, everything should be run by business.

158
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.848
Everything should be privatized, the jails, the schools,

159
00:07:15.848 --> 00:07:18.803
even the military, which we're now seeing in Afghanistan,

160
00:07:18.803 --> 00:07:20.758
a privatization of the military.

161
00:07:20.758 --> 00:07:25.756
So these three principles together, have created a situation

162
00:07:25.756 --> 00:07:29.195
where we have a very unsustainable, unjust,

163
00:07:29.195 --> 00:07:31.659
and unpeaceful world, it's really an insane world

164
00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:34.205
that we've developed out of this.

165
00:07:34.205 --> 00:07:38.109
This economic system, and I call it predatory economics.

166
00:07:38.109 --> 00:07:40.222
<v ->And you also call it mutant capitalism.</v>

167
00:07:40.222 --> 00:07:43.198
<v ->Yeah, I think it's definitely a mutant form of capitalism.</v>

168
00:07:43.198 --> 00:07:46.472
Capitalism's been around for 400 plus or minus years,

169
00:07:46.472 --> 00:07:49.630
and it's taken many different forms, it's a chameleon.

170
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.840
But this particular one, I think, is a real mutant,

171
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.573
in that it's ultimately self-destructive,

172
00:07:56.573 --> 00:07:58.461
and it's totally unsustainable,

173
00:07:58.461 --> 00:08:00.146
and it's making a lot of money

174
00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:03.570
and giving a lot of power to a very small group of people,

175
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.193
very much like the old feudal systems of Europe did,

176
00:08:06.193 --> 00:08:07.848
where you had the castle and everybody else

177
00:08:07.848 --> 00:08:09.444
lived outside the castle and were very poor.

178
00:08:09.444 --> 00:08:10.793
<v ->Yes, we're very much like that now.</v>

179
00:08:10.793 --> 00:08:12.690
It's even happening in the U.S. now.

180
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.373
<v ->And it was unsustainable in feudal Europe</v>

181
00:08:15.373 --> 00:08:17.507
and it's unsustainable now, it's gonna collapse.

182
00:08:17.507 --> 00:08:19.416
It is collapsing, we're seeing it collapse,

183
00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:22.061
and the only question is, is it going to collapse

184
00:08:22.061 --> 00:08:23.544
in such a way that we're all terribly

185
00:08:23.544 --> 00:08:26.625
devastated or can we make a transition?

186
00:08:26.625 --> 00:08:28.064
<v ->And that's what we're going to talk about</v>

187
00:08:28.064 --> 00:08:30.267
is the potentials that can come out of this

188
00:08:30.267 --> 00:08:32.833
and you know it's the timing is gonna be really the,

189
00:08:32.833 --> 00:08:35.764
seems to me, the critical factor right now.

190
00:08:35.764 --> 00:08:38.637
Do you mind if I read off page 128 of "Hoodwinked,"

191
00:08:38.637 --> 00:08:40.055
we're talking about capitalism

192
00:08:40.055 --> 00:08:42.902
and I thought this was wonderfully apropos.

193
00:08:42.902 --> 00:08:45.025
You have a definition, what is capitalism.

194
00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:47.904
Capitalism, economic system in which private individuals

195
00:08:47.904 --> 00:08:50.528
and business firms carry on the production

196
00:08:50.528 --> 00:08:52.362
and exchange of goods and services

197
00:08:52.362 --> 00:08:56.186
through a complex network of prices and markets.

198
00:08:56.186 --> 00:08:58.523
And as you say to the followup, this does not mean

199
00:08:58.523 --> 00:09:00.687
that capitalists must plunder resources

200
00:09:00.687 --> 00:09:03.942
or omit externalities from their accounting practices,

201
00:09:03.942 --> 00:09:06.703
nor does it suggest that profit should be the sole motive,

202
00:09:06.703 --> 00:09:10.416
or the lack of regulation as a requirement, and on and on.

203
00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:13.477
That is what our current overlay, as you say,

204
00:09:13.477 --> 00:09:15.845
Friedman economics has led us to.

205
00:09:15.845 --> 00:09:19.589
And it might be interesting, another stat you talk about

206
00:09:19.589 --> 00:09:24.046
is under Bush Jr., when he was President.

207
00:09:24.046 --> 00:09:26.607
You say the net worth of the 400 wealthiest went

208
00:09:26.607 --> 00:09:29.646
from one trillion to 1.6 trillion in that period of time.

209
00:09:29.646 --> 00:09:32.398
That's a significant amount of money.

210
00:09:32.398 --> 00:09:36.030
At the same time, the debt rose from five trillion

211
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.562
to 10 trillion, while the average worker income

212
00:09:38.562 --> 00:09:43.439
went down $2,000, so just these little stats here

213
00:09:43.439 --> 00:09:44.604
pretty much show what's going on.

214
00:09:44.604 --> 00:09:46.309
There was a transfer of wealth somewhere

215
00:09:46.309 --> 00:09:47.867
that we took on as debt that went

216
00:09:47.867 --> 00:09:50.214
to those same few elite families.

217
00:09:50.214 --> 00:09:53.968
<v ->And it's gotten worse, I just saw last week a report where</v>

218
00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:56.710
the wealthiest, I can't remember if it was one percent

219
00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:01.045
or what it was, but the wealthiest small percentage point

220
00:10:01.045 --> 00:10:06.045
in our country just increased their income by 500 times,

221
00:10:06.045 --> 00:10:08.187
and that's while the rest of us

222
00:10:08.187 --> 00:10:10.411
are going through a recession.

223
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:12.991
<v ->Well, I mean we read about these bonuses,</v>

224
00:10:12.991 --> 00:10:17.115
but it didn't hit me that it was to that extent.

225
00:10:17.115 --> 00:10:21.380
<v ->Well you see, the robber barons</v>

226
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.546
know how to take advantage of recessions.

227
00:10:23.546 --> 00:10:26.372
So, the very people that

228
00:10:26.372 --> 00:10:29.050
coerced a homeowner

229
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:32.752
to buy a $500,000 house when the homeowner

230
00:10:32.752 --> 00:10:35.536
could really only afford a $300,000 house

231
00:10:35.536 --> 00:10:39.834
ended up taking that house back, the bank,

232
00:10:39.834 --> 00:10:43.898
for nothing, basically, foreclosed the guy who had the house,

233
00:10:43.898 --> 00:10:46.767
walked away, foreclosed, the bank ended up owning it

234
00:10:46.767 --> 00:10:50.202
and repackaging it and reselling it.

235
00:10:50.202 --> 00:10:53.594
And when you do that and not just with houses,

236
00:10:53.594 --> 00:10:55.353
but you do that with businesses,

237
00:10:55.353 --> 00:10:57.560
you do that with everything across the economy,

238
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.366
you find yourself increasing your wealth phenomenally,

239
00:11:00.366 --> 00:11:02.115
if you're in a position to do that.

240
00:11:02.115 --> 00:11:05.951
You're in a position to increase your wealth by 500 times,

241
00:11:05.951 --> 00:11:10.943
and it's a terrible system, and it's not leading to a world

242
00:11:10.943 --> 00:11:15.019
that I care to bring my three-year-old grandson up in.

243
00:11:15.019 --> 00:11:18.539
Every time I look at this young boy I think, my God,

244
00:11:18.539 --> 00:11:21.418
what are we creating for his generation.

245
00:11:21.418 --> 00:11:23.861
And you know for the first time in history,

246
00:11:23.861 --> 00:11:25.951
I have to be aware, we all have to be aware

247
00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:29.054
that the only way our children and grandchildren

248
00:11:29.054 --> 00:11:32.094
can grow up in a sustainable, just, and peaceful world

249
00:11:32.094 --> 00:11:36.647
is if every child, on every remote corner of this planet,

250
00:11:36.647 --> 00:11:40.434
has that same opportunity and realizes it, and this is new.

251
00:11:40.434 --> 00:11:41.891
<v ->This is a huge paradigm shift.</v>

252
00:11:41.891 --> 00:11:44.076
<v ->It's a huge shift, used to be that if we took care</v>

253
00:11:44.076 --> 00:11:46.262
of the United State or even our own state,

254
00:11:46.262 --> 00:11:47.884
that's really all that was required,

255
00:11:47.884 --> 00:11:50.148
and let the rest of the world go to hell.

256
00:11:50.148 --> 00:11:51.289
But that's no longer the case.

257
00:11:51.289 --> 00:11:54.564
We're so interrelated, integrated, interdependent,

258
00:11:54.564 --> 00:11:58.255
that we've got to realize that the only way our kids

259
00:11:58.255 --> 00:12:01.028
are going to survive in a decent world is if every kid

260
00:12:01.028 --> 00:12:03.555
has that same decent world to survive in.

261
00:12:03.555 --> 00:12:05.763
<v ->Let's go to two examples of this</v>

262
00:12:05.763 --> 00:12:08.313
because you write about them in the book and that is,

263
00:12:08.313 --> 00:12:09.891
one of them has to do with Iran.

264
00:12:09.891 --> 00:12:12.271
I mean we're looking at constant rumors.

265
00:12:12.271 --> 00:12:16.239
We're on the verge of some kind of nuclear event

266
00:12:16.239 --> 00:12:19.097
with Iran, or perhaps between Iran and Israel,

267
00:12:19.097 --> 00:12:21.539
and yet this story started long ago,

268
00:12:21.539 --> 00:12:24.089
if you wouldn't mind telling us that story,

269
00:12:24.089 --> 00:12:26.435
post-World War Two, Kermit Roosevelt

270
00:12:26.435 --> 00:12:27.999
and what actually happened and

271
00:12:27.999 --> 00:12:30.174
how that has led to what's going on today.

272
00:12:30.174 --> 00:12:31.867
Most people don't understand this.

273
00:12:31.867 --> 00:12:36.862
<v ->Well in the early 1950s, Iran had a Premier who was</v>

274
00:12:36.862 --> 00:12:39.587
considered to be the model for democracy, in many respects.

275
00:12:39.587 --> 00:12:42.389
He was Time magazine's Man of the Year in 1951,

276
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:46.825
Mohammed Mossadeg, and he was held up as this model,

277
00:12:46.825 --> 00:12:50.356
and Iran had a great future, but Mossadeg had run

278
00:12:50.356 --> 00:12:54.888
on a campaign promise that he would make sure

279
00:12:54.888 --> 00:12:57.631
that if he became Premier, more of the profits

280
00:12:57.631 --> 00:13:00.180
from the oil of Iran would go to the Iranian people,

281
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.590
not just to foreign oil companies.

282
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:06.306
And once he became Premier, he implemented policies

283
00:13:06.306 --> 00:13:07.841
to ensure that that would happen.

284
00:13:07.841 --> 00:13:08.949
And of course, the international

285
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:11.518
oil companies didn't like that very much,

286
00:13:11.518 --> 00:13:16.025
so Eisenhower and the Dulles brothers, who were his

287
00:13:16.025 --> 00:13:20.244
chief, head of CIA and also state department,

288
00:13:20.244 --> 00:13:23.137
decided that they had to get rid of Mossadeg.

289
00:13:23.137 --> 00:13:25.366
At that point, they didn't want to send in the military,

290
00:13:25.366 --> 00:13:28.051
the common way to do it, because Iran was on the border

291
00:13:28.051 --> 00:13:30.546
with Russia and in the early '50s, we were just really

292
00:13:30.546 --> 00:13:33.725
in the heat of the Cold War, Russia had nuclear weapons,

293
00:13:33.725 --> 00:13:35.655
we had nuclear weapons, Eisenhower was afraid

294
00:13:35.655 --> 00:13:37.697
that it would trigger a nuclear war.

295
00:13:37.697 --> 00:13:42.217
So instead, they sent in this CIA agent Kermit Roosevelt,

296
00:13:42.217 --> 00:13:45.535
Teddy Roosevelt's grandson, and Kermit,

297
00:13:45.535 --> 00:13:49.696
with a few million dollars, managed to start a rebellion.

298
00:13:49.696 --> 00:13:52.011
He hired a bunch of thugs and they took to the streets.

299
00:13:52.011 --> 00:13:53.619
It made it look like the people of Iran

300
00:13:53.619 --> 00:13:56.468
were opposed to the Shah, which wasn't--

301
00:13:56.468 --> 00:13:58.043
were opposed to Mossadeg, which, of course,

302
00:13:58.043 --> 00:14:01.826
wasn't true at all, but he overthrew Mossadeg,

303
00:14:01.826 --> 00:14:03.542
and replaced him with the Shah,

304
00:14:03.542 --> 00:14:05.238
who we all know was a brutal dictator,

305
00:14:05.238 --> 00:14:07.493
but a very good friend of oil and other

306
00:14:07.493 --> 00:14:12.479
big U.S. corporations, and I worked for the Shah for some

307
00:14:12.479 --> 00:14:16.845
years in the '70s, so I'm very familiar with that situation.

308
00:14:16.845 --> 00:14:19.373
But here you had an opportunity, in the Middle East,

309
00:14:19.373 --> 00:14:24.258
in Iran to actually foster democracy, and to support it.

310
00:14:24.258 --> 00:14:27.170
We had that opportunity, we did exactly the opposite.

311
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:30.168
And had we gone in there and helped Mossadeg,

312
00:14:30.168 --> 00:14:32.108
bringing his poorest of the poor of Iran

313
00:14:32.108 --> 00:14:35.494
up by their bootstraps, using Iranian oil to do that,

314
00:14:35.494 --> 00:14:36.499
I'm sure it would have changed

315
00:14:36.499 --> 00:14:39.031
the whole profile of the Middle East.

316
00:14:39.031 --> 00:14:41.820
We would never have the situation that we have today.

317
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.785
But we chose not to do it that way.

318
00:14:43.785 --> 00:14:48.748
Not only that, but we were so successful, in CIA terms,

319
00:14:48.748 --> 00:14:50.912
that this became the new model.

320
00:14:50.912 --> 00:14:52.747
Instead of sending in the military,

321
00:14:52.747 --> 00:14:56.022
let's send in Kermit Roosevelts.

322
00:14:56.022 --> 00:14:57.409
The only problem was Roosevelt

323
00:14:57.409 --> 00:14:59.806
was a card-carrying CIA agent.

324
00:14:59.806 --> 00:15:02.505
Had he been discovered, it would've been very embarrassing

325
00:15:02.505 --> 00:15:04.799
for the U.S. government, so the decision was made

326
00:15:04.799 --> 00:15:07.955
very soon after that, not to use card-carrying agents,

327
00:15:07.955 --> 00:15:10.632
but instead to use private contractors like me,

328
00:15:10.632 --> 00:15:13.493
economic hit men who if we got caught doing

329
00:15:13.493 --> 00:15:16.020
our dirty business, it didn't have to be

330
00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.407
traced back to the government.

331
00:15:17.407 --> 00:15:18.541
We didn't work for the government,

332
00:15:18.541 --> 00:15:19.953
we worked for private corporations,

333
00:15:19.953 --> 00:15:23.771
who, of course, were under government contract.

334
00:15:23.771 --> 00:15:25.883
<v ->So, all we have to do is read headlines today</v>

335
00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:28.070
to find out what that has fostered

336
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:32.705
between U.S. and Iranian relations, for sure.

337
00:15:32.705 --> 00:15:36.660
<v ->Well, today in Iran, I think what we're seeing is this,</v>

338
00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:40.265
Iran-ophobia, basically, this terrible distrust

339
00:15:40.265 --> 00:15:43.091
and hatred of Iran and then it involves

340
00:15:43.091 --> 00:15:45.832
the whole Muslim world, to a certain degree.

341
00:15:45.832 --> 00:15:48.160
<v ->Carefully orchestrated by the media.</v>

342
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.522
<v ->Very carefully orchestrated by the media.</v>

343
00:15:50.522 --> 00:15:54.747
And a large part of that fear, I believe,

344
00:15:54.747 --> 00:15:59.238
is a knowledge that Iran has a legitimate role to play

345
00:15:59.238 --> 00:16:00.774
in the Middle East, it always has.

346
00:16:00.774 --> 00:16:02.813
It's a very powerful country with a lot of oil,

347
00:16:02.813 --> 00:16:06.581
and a very clever country and in a way it defeated

348
00:16:06.581 --> 00:16:09.621
Israel, to a certain degree, if you want to put it that way,

349
00:16:09.621 --> 00:16:14.430
in Lebanon because Iran supports Hezbollah and Hamas,

350
00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.227
both of them, and it's very subtle.

351
00:16:16.227 --> 00:16:18.030
Iran, itself, didn't go in and do anything,

352
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.704
but it supported these groups that

353
00:16:19.704 --> 00:16:22.531
have been quite successful in their own way.

354
00:16:22.531 --> 00:16:24.841
It's a very subtle form of way.

355
00:16:24.841 --> 00:16:27.558
But, the United States, in its determination

356
00:16:27.558 --> 00:16:30.855
to have world control, sees countries like Iran

357
00:16:30.855 --> 00:16:34.661
and China as huge threats because they are

358
00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:39.353
the true opposition to us in quite a really legitimate way.

359
00:16:39.353 --> 00:16:41.581
It's not necessarily military.

360
00:16:41.581 --> 00:16:42.732
<v ->You have very well-educated</v>

361
00:16:42.732 --> 00:16:44.891
and highly-cultured individuals there--

362
00:16:44.891 --> 00:16:46.315
<v ->With a lot of resources and the</v>

363
00:16:46.315 --> 00:16:48.205
knowledge of how to use the resources.

364
00:16:48.205 --> 00:16:50.522
And think about it, if you're Iranian,

365
00:16:50.522 --> 00:16:52.869
you're surrounded by nuclear weapons,

366
00:16:52.869 --> 00:16:55.812
Russia has them, Israel has them,

367
00:16:55.812 --> 00:16:59.461
Iraq now has them through us, India and Pakistan.

368
00:16:59.461 --> 00:17:01.434
I mean you're surrounded by nuclear weapons,

369
00:17:01.434 --> 00:17:04.852
and you're saying why shouldn't we have them.

370
00:17:04.852 --> 00:17:06.078
I'm not advocating nuclear weapons.

371
00:17:06.078 --> 00:17:08.549
I'd like to see all of them destroyed but if I'm an Iranian,

372
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:10.821
I'm gonna say what's the justice here.

373
00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:13.389
It's a little bit like us telling the Lakota,

374
00:17:13.389 --> 00:17:15.942
back in the 1800s when Custer was going out there,

375
00:17:15.942 --> 00:17:18.246
you can't have guns, which we did,

376
00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:20.358
we said guns are illegal on the reservation.

377
00:17:20.358 --> 00:17:22.000
You can't have guns, we have the guns,

378
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.372
you're not allowed to have them.

379
00:17:23.372 --> 00:17:25.344
Well that would pretty much upset you.

380
00:17:25.344 --> 00:17:27.942
It would really upset me if somebody said that to me.

381
00:17:27.942 --> 00:17:29.534
<v ->Absolutely, not a just situation.</v>

382
00:17:29.534 --> 00:17:31.027
<v ->No.</v>

383
00:17:31.027 --> 00:17:35.559
<v ->Okay, let's go to, there's a quote in here,</v>

384
00:17:35.559 --> 00:17:38.314
a man in debt is so far a slave,

385
00:17:38.314 --> 00:17:40.682
and the same thing with a country in debt,

386
00:17:40.682 --> 00:17:43.092
and as you said, part of your job was to make sure

387
00:17:43.092 --> 00:17:46.048
that these countries were indebted to the United States

388
00:17:46.048 --> 00:17:47.668
so that we could plunder their resources.

389
00:17:47.668 --> 00:17:51.737
And let's talk about the relationship with Ecuador,

390
00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:53.646
and what's happened historically with Ecuador,

391
00:17:53.646 --> 00:17:56.474
right up till now, it's a very interesting country.

392
00:17:56.474 --> 00:17:59.374
<v ->Well, Ecuador is a fascinating country from the standpoint</v>

393
00:17:59.374 --> 00:18:01.967
of its relationship to debt and us,

394
00:18:01.967 --> 00:18:03.219
and a country I know very well.

395
00:18:03.219 --> 00:18:04.651
That's where I was a Peace Corps volunteer.

396
00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:06.456
I have three godchildren living in Ecuador.

397
00:18:06.456 --> 00:18:09.039
I have a very strong connection, and Rafael Correa,

398
00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:11.546
the current President of Ecuador, I count as a friend.

399
00:18:11.546 --> 00:18:13.242
He gave me a great endorsement for my book,

400
00:18:13.242 --> 00:18:15.387
and he has a PhD in economics

401
00:18:15.387 --> 00:18:17.317
from the University of Illinois.

402
00:18:17.317 --> 00:18:21.157
You can't really write him off as a radical Marxist.

403
00:18:21.157 --> 00:18:23.614
He's not, he's a capitalist, and he says,

404
00:18:23.614 --> 00:18:25.786
I don't see any reason why Capitalism can't be used

405
00:18:25.786 --> 00:18:27.482
to help my poorest of the poor

406
00:18:27.482 --> 00:18:28.995
pull themselves up by their bootstraps.

407
00:18:28.995 --> 00:18:32.423
He says, I don't want foreign aid, I don't want U.S. aid.

408
00:18:32.423 --> 00:18:36.491
We have tremendous resources in this country of Ecuador.

409
00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:41.099
We're the third largest oil reserves in Latin America.

410
00:18:41.099 --> 00:18:43.306
Let us use our oil reserves, let us use

411
00:18:43.306 --> 00:18:45.280
our resources to pull our own people up.

412
00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.413
Stop stealing our resources, stop plundering.

413
00:18:47.413 --> 00:18:49.528
We're not gonna allow this to happen anymore.

414
00:18:49.528 --> 00:18:51.937
So, he's pretty much on our bad boy list,

415
00:18:51.937 --> 00:18:54.676
and the corporatocracy doesn't really

416
00:18:54.676 --> 00:18:55.806
know how to deal with him though

417
00:18:55.806 --> 00:19:00.372
because like I said, they can't pigeonhole him.

418
00:19:00.372 --> 00:19:03.581
But one of the reasons that they're so disturbed by him is

419
00:19:03.581 --> 00:19:07.603
he's refusing to pay three billion dollars worth of IMF debt

420
00:19:07.603 --> 00:19:10.248
and he says, my people don't owe that debt.

421
00:19:10.248 --> 00:19:13.970
It was signed off on by

422
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:17.735
brutal dictators back in the '70s.

423
00:19:17.735 --> 00:19:19.122
And I know that to be true, I was there.

424
00:19:19.122 --> 00:19:20.590
<v ->Cause you were there, you were part of it.</v>

425
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.093
<v ->I know all that, and these dictators were put into power</v>

426
00:19:23.093 --> 00:19:26.154
by the CIA, and kept there by the CIA.

427
00:19:26.154 --> 00:19:29.268
And they were extremely favorable to foreign oil companies.

428
00:19:29.268 --> 00:19:31.541
They gave them incredible breaks including Texaco,

429
00:19:31.541 --> 00:19:36.319
allowing Texaco to dump 16 billion gallons of toxic waste

430
00:19:36.319 --> 00:19:39.348
into the Ecuadorian Amazon, 16 billion gallons.

431
00:19:39.348 --> 00:19:44.116
BP in the Gulf of Mexico was 200 million, 16 billion.

432
00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:45.886
This is what these dictators allowed.

433
00:19:45.886 --> 00:19:48.938
The Ecuadorian people did not sign off on the loans

434
00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:51.796
that these dictators took, and Correa's saying,

435
00:19:51.796 --> 00:19:54.346
my people don't owe this money.

436
00:19:54.346 --> 00:19:56.746
The dictators took it, they run away with it,

437
00:19:56.746 --> 00:19:58.622
they live in Miami now, or Switzerland,

438
00:19:58.622 --> 00:20:00.810
or wherever they live, go find them,

439
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.270
get them to pay off the money.

440
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:04.059
Or maybe the World Bank owes them money

441
00:20:04.059 --> 00:20:06.213
because they fostered this whole thing.

442
00:20:06.213 --> 00:20:07.696
Or maybe John Perkins and other

443
00:20:07.696 --> 00:20:09.737
economic hit men owe this money.

444
00:20:09.737 --> 00:20:11.152
<v ->Right (laughing).</v>

445
00:20:11.152 --> 00:20:13.238
<v ->He said the only thing I know is my people don't</v>

446
00:20:13.238 --> 00:20:15.882
owe the money, and they never got any benefits from it,

447
00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:17.535
and I'm not paying, we're not paying.

448
00:20:17.535 --> 00:20:18.965
<v ->So then what happened?</v>

449
00:20:18.965 --> 00:20:22.965
<v ->Well, you know, there was a big U.N. cry,</v>

450
00:20:22.965 --> 00:20:24.298
and we tried to put Correa down

451
00:20:24.298 --> 00:20:26.570
and he stuck to his guns, and so

452
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:31.040
we launched a coup against him about a month ago or so.

453
00:20:32.332 --> 00:20:34.824
He survived it, fortunately,

454
00:20:34.824 --> 00:20:39.058
but it was a CIA-plotted coup.

455
00:20:39.058 --> 00:20:41.149
There's no question about it, in fact,

456
00:20:41.149 --> 00:20:45.170
the Ecuadorian military leader, who was the spearhead of it,

457
00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.899
was trained at the School of the Americas

458
00:20:46.899 --> 00:20:51.396
under the CIA auspices, but Correa is very clever,

459
00:20:51.396 --> 00:20:53.135
and the people were very supportive of him,

460
00:20:53.135 --> 00:20:55.473
and he survived the coup.

461
00:20:55.473 --> 00:20:57.715
Of course, a year earlier, something similar had happened

462
00:20:57.715 --> 00:21:02.091
in Honduras with democratically-elected President Zelaya,

463
00:21:02.091 --> 00:21:06.966
who opposed Cargill, Kraft, Chiquita, Dole,

464
00:21:06.966 --> 00:21:11.307
Russell Athletic, Nike, some of our big corporations.

465
00:21:11.307 --> 00:21:13.798
He was trying to increase the minimum wage in Honduras,

466
00:21:13.798 --> 00:21:18.694
and also reform, excuse me, revise the land reform laws,

467
00:21:18.694 --> 00:21:20.027
to be in favor of the people rather

468
00:21:20.027 --> 00:21:23.955
than foreign corporations, and he wouldn't be bribed

469
00:21:23.955 --> 00:21:25.959
or turned around by economic hit men,

470
00:21:25.959 --> 00:21:30.172
just like Correa wouldn't, and so we launched

471
00:21:30.172 --> 00:21:33.948
a CIA coup against him, and that one was successful.

472
00:21:33.948 --> 00:21:36.785
He was overthrown, he's now left the country.

473
00:21:36.785 --> 00:21:38.644
<v ->And we're not, we're talking about such</v>

474
00:21:38.644 --> 00:21:41.080
gross injustice that he was standing up for.

475
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.000
In your book, you talk about how,

476
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.186
in some cases, you're talking about children

477
00:21:45.186 --> 00:21:48.737
and people making six and a half cents an hour,

478
00:21:48.737 --> 00:21:52.054
working abusively long days and 14 hour shifts.

479
00:21:52.054 --> 00:21:55.446
I think part of that was, correct me if I'm wrong,

480
00:21:55.446 --> 00:21:56.706
part of that had to do with Nike,

481
00:21:56.706 --> 00:21:58.618
but they're not the only ones, this is

482
00:21:58.618 --> 00:22:00.249
happening in other corporations, too.

483
00:22:00.249 --> 00:22:03.596
These people are simply asking that their people have,

484
00:22:03.596 --> 00:22:07.329
make a working wage instead of being exploited

485
00:22:07.329 --> 00:22:10.210
to the extent that essentially it's worse than slaves,

486
00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:14.801
slaves with no energy left to do anything but.

487
00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:18.759
Not acceptable in a humanistic level.

488
00:22:18.759 --> 00:22:21.339
<v ->No, to think that the American public is,</v>

489
00:22:21.339 --> 00:22:22.757
pretends to be blind to all this,

490
00:22:22.757 --> 00:22:25.808
in many cases, is blind and we go out

491
00:22:25.808 --> 00:22:30.794
and buy things that are made by child slaves, or any slaves.

492
00:22:30.794 --> 00:22:33.987
Here, we teach in our schools we got rid of slavery,

493
00:22:33.987 --> 00:22:35.598
during the Civil War, but we didn't.

494
00:22:35.598 --> 00:22:37.697
There's a lot more slavery today than there ever was.

495
00:22:37.697 --> 00:22:40.223
<v ->And we're supporting it by the way</v>

496
00:22:40.223 --> 00:22:42.483
we choose to spend our dollars.

497
00:22:42.483 --> 00:22:44.119
<v ->Every one of us who buys anything</v>

498
00:22:44.119 --> 00:22:48.065
that's made by one of these companies is supporting it.

499
00:22:48.065 --> 00:22:51.383
I go overboard not to buy anything made by Dole or Chiquita,

500
00:22:51.383 --> 00:22:53.728
Nike, and let them know we must do that,

501
00:22:53.728 --> 00:22:55.383
and we must let them know, send them emails

502
00:22:55.383 --> 00:22:57.464
and tell them why we're not buying from them

503
00:22:57.464 --> 00:23:01.068
because after all, in the long run, we do have control

504
00:23:01.068 --> 00:23:02.530
over these corporations that are dependent

505
00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:04.199
on us to buy their goods and services.

506
00:23:04.199 --> 00:23:06.226
<v ->Yes, and that's a good part of the story</v>

507
00:23:06.226 --> 00:23:08.958
where we start taking back our own power.

508
00:23:08.958 --> 00:23:10.843
Just briefly, going through the U.S.

509
00:23:10.843 --> 00:23:12.700
and what's happened here as well,

510
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.025
talking about this outsourcing.

511
00:23:15.025 --> 00:23:17.456
In 1950s, you say, a third of the U.S. population

512
00:23:17.456 --> 00:23:20.272
was employed in factories and then,

513
00:23:20.272 --> 00:23:25.009
it went down by 2002, it was 10%, rather than 33%,

514
00:23:25.009 --> 00:23:26.641
and today it's even less than that

515
00:23:26.641 --> 00:23:28.494
because we have factories of every kind

516
00:23:28.494 --> 00:23:31.864
that have folded since 2002, so what are we looking at?

517
00:23:31.864 --> 00:23:35.597
Maybe, maybe 3% of the population

518
00:23:35.597 --> 00:23:37.324
left in manufacturing in the U.S.?

519
00:23:37.324 --> 00:23:38.925
<v ->I don't know exactly what the percentage is</v>

520
00:23:38.925 --> 00:23:41.921
but it's very, very low, we don't make much here.

521
00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:46.918
<v ->We don't make much here, and that is part of the solution,</v>

522
00:23:46.918 --> 00:23:49.324
again, and I want to start moving into them

523
00:23:49.324 --> 00:23:52.129
because you really articulate what the problems are,

524
00:23:52.129 --> 00:23:54.039
how the genesis of how we've gotten

525
00:23:54.039 --> 00:23:57.452
into this situation we're in, and before we get into it,

526
00:23:57.452 --> 00:23:59.532
one other thing I think is really critical,

527
00:23:59.532 --> 00:24:03.340
and it's your, the way you hold the subject

528
00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.210
of international terrorism, and you spoke about something

529
00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:08.652
I thought was just so beautiful,

530
00:24:08.652 --> 00:24:11.595
talking about the Somali pirates.

531
00:24:11.595 --> 00:24:13.826
Would you just give a little synopsis of what you learned

532
00:24:13.826 --> 00:24:16.012
in your conversation with one of them?

533
00:24:16.012 --> 00:24:18.262
<v ->The Somali pirates are indicative</v>

534
00:24:18.262 --> 00:24:20.748
of this whole business of terrorism,

535
00:24:20.748 --> 00:24:23.276
and I've met a lot of terrorists.

536
00:24:23.276 --> 00:24:26.272
FARC members in Colombia and Somali pirates

537
00:24:26.272 --> 00:24:29.386
and al-Qaeda members and they don't have

538
00:24:29.386 --> 00:24:32.982
anything in common with each other, this is not an -ism.

539
00:24:32.982 --> 00:24:35.327
An -ism implies that a common philosophy,

540
00:24:35.327 --> 00:24:37.770
or common mode of operation.

541
00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:41.417
Catholicism's an -ism, communism is an -ism,

542
00:24:41.417 --> 00:24:43.732
terrorism today is not an -ism.

543
00:24:43.732 --> 00:24:45.086
There are people all over the world

544
00:24:45.086 --> 00:24:48.649
committing acts of terror, but they're not united.

545
00:24:48.649 --> 00:24:50.128
And most of them don't share anything

546
00:24:50.128 --> 00:24:52.298
in common except desperation.

547
00:24:52.298 --> 00:24:54.440
So in Colombia, you've got poor peasants

548
00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.765
who have been thrown off their land because of

549
00:24:56.765 --> 00:25:00.945
big hydroelectric projects or oil, and they're desperate,

550
00:25:00.945 --> 00:25:02.663
they don't know how to feed their kids.

551
00:25:02.663 --> 00:25:04.988
In Somalia, you've got fishermen whose waters

552
00:25:04.988 --> 00:25:09.467
have been fished clean illegally by foreign vessels

553
00:25:09.467 --> 00:25:12.646
who did it openly, and Somali fishermen complained

554
00:25:12.646 --> 00:25:15.483
to the U.N. for 20 years and never got justice.

555
00:25:15.483 --> 00:25:18.758
And also, the big U.S. shipping lanes that go through there,

556
00:25:18.758 --> 00:25:22.629
including nuclear waste from our base

557
00:25:22.629 --> 00:25:25.423
in Diego Garcia, in the Indian Ocean.

558
00:25:25.423 --> 00:25:27.791
And so, the fishing waters have been destroyed,

559
00:25:27.791 --> 00:25:30.021
and these families don't know what to do now.

560
00:25:30.021 --> 00:25:32.207
These men who are fishermen don't know what to do

561
00:25:32.207 --> 00:25:36.409
except to turn to piracy, and unfortunately,

562
00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:40.633
once people take on that route, they can't get out of it,

563
00:25:40.633 --> 00:25:42.980
and it becomes there way of living.

564
00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.444
So you do you have now with FARC in Colombia,

565
00:25:45.444 --> 00:25:49.411
they've become extortionists, they've become kidnappers,

566
00:25:49.411 --> 00:25:52.754
and the Somali pirates, it appears they're becoming

567
00:25:52.754 --> 00:25:55.299
quite happy to be pirates in their own way,

568
00:25:55.299 --> 00:25:56.708
although the ones I talked to say,

569
00:25:56.708 --> 00:25:58.696
we hate being pirates, it's incredibly dangerous.

570
00:25:58.696 --> 00:26:01.708
Fishing was dangerous enough, piracy's a lot more dangerous.

571
00:26:01.708 --> 00:26:03.168
But the fact is, it's ingrained,

572
00:26:03.168 --> 00:26:04.437
and once you've committed one act

573
00:26:04.437 --> 00:26:07.714
like that you're a criminal, you can never go back.

574
00:26:07.714 --> 00:26:10.561
And so you're stuck with it, and it's the shame

575
00:26:10.561 --> 00:26:13.282
of the world today that we don't recognize

576
00:26:13.282 --> 00:26:18.135
how these starving, desperate people are driven

577
00:26:18.135 --> 00:26:21.484
to acts of terror and then become criminal forever,

578
00:26:21.484 --> 00:26:23.521
and not only do we not recognize it,

579
00:26:23.521 --> 00:26:27.088
but our military capitalizes upon it.

580
00:26:27.088 --> 00:26:29.830
The corporatocracy capitalizes upon it to say,

581
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:33.519
well we've got to fight a global war on terrorism.

582
00:26:33.519 --> 00:26:36.688
It's this united front, and bin Laden

583
00:26:36.688 --> 00:26:40.442
and al-Qaeda's the spearhead of this huge front,

584
00:26:40.442 --> 00:26:43.812
which is a bunch of BS, it's just not true.

585
00:26:43.812 --> 00:26:45.273
But it's a very convenient way

586
00:26:45.273 --> 00:26:48.067
to rally the Americans behind,

587
00:26:48.067 --> 00:26:51.197
U.S. citizens behind a cause supposedly,

588
00:26:51.197 --> 00:26:53.416
so we get rid of communism, now we've got to find

589
00:26:53.416 --> 00:26:58.416
another -ism to fight in order to justify a military budget

590
00:26:58.459 --> 00:27:01.896
that today, is over 60% of our discretionary budget,

591
00:27:01.896 --> 00:27:03.885
all going to the military.
<v Regina>Criminal.</v>

592
00:27:03.885 --> 00:27:05.326
That is criminal.
<v John>Not only criminal</v>

593
00:27:05.326 --> 00:27:08.647
but it doesn't help anybody in the world, basically.

594
00:27:08.647 --> 00:27:11.267
I mean we don't employ many people.

595
00:27:11.267 --> 00:27:14.162
We don't employ many people and we go off to foreign lands,

596
00:27:14.162 --> 00:27:15.795
and all this stuff we're making we're destroying

597
00:27:15.795 --> 00:27:17.883
in those foreign lands, so we're making missiles

598
00:27:17.883 --> 00:27:20.027
and tanks and so on, destroying them.

599
00:27:20.027 --> 00:27:22.374
They're not really creating an economy,

600
00:27:22.374 --> 00:27:26.640
and making people extremely angry at us.

601
00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.019
<v ->So, it's coming down to action time,</v>

602
00:27:29.019 --> 00:27:30.320
on the part of every one of us,

603
00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:34.940
and you had the,

604
00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.384
I think the Dalai Lama would say

605
00:27:36.384 --> 00:27:37.465
he had the privilege of sitting

606
00:27:37.465 --> 00:27:39.796
next to you on an airplane one day.

607
00:27:39.796 --> 00:27:41.450
He had read your book and someone saw you

608
00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:43.545
and arranged a meeting while you were up in the air,

609
00:27:43.545 --> 00:27:47.118
and the Dalai Lama, I love what you say here,

610
00:27:47.118 --> 00:27:50.771
he said to you, meditation is good but that's not enough.

611
00:27:50.771 --> 00:27:52.190
People have to take action.

612
00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:53.075
<v ->Yes.</v>

613
00:27:53.075 --> 00:27:54.662
<v ->And that's where you start coming in</v>

614
00:27:54.662 --> 00:27:57.764
on the second part of your book, "Hoodwinked,"

615
00:27:57.764 --> 00:27:59.701
and let's talk about some of the action we really,

616
00:27:59.701 --> 00:28:02.734
truly do have the power to

617
00:28:02.734 --> 00:28:06.051
spin into motion, as individuals.

618
00:28:06.051 --> 00:28:08.979
<v ->Well, I think that's the key, is we have to understand</v>

619
00:28:08.979 --> 00:28:12.447
that we have to take the responsibility, as individuals.

620
00:28:12.447 --> 00:28:16.596
And that the, what we're up against today,

621
00:28:16.596 --> 00:28:20.382
is a geopolitical system that's run by big corporations.

622
00:28:20.382 --> 00:28:22.377
That's the first understanding we have to come to.

623
00:28:22.377 --> 00:28:24.252
It isn't about governments.

624
00:28:24.252 --> 00:28:26.384
Several hundred years ago, geopolitics were run

625
00:28:26.384 --> 00:28:28.625
by religious organizations basically,

626
00:28:28.625 --> 00:28:30.365
and then it switched to governments,

627
00:28:30.365 --> 00:28:31.668
and you had totalitarian governments,

628
00:28:31.668 --> 00:28:33.337
and you had democratic governments, and everything

629
00:28:33.337 --> 00:28:36.160
in between but the governments were in control.

630
00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:41.079
And in a democracy or republic like the United States,

631
00:28:41.079 --> 00:28:43.963
our elected officials wrote the laws.

632
00:28:43.963 --> 00:28:45.871
But now we've moved into a new phase,

633
00:28:45.871 --> 00:28:48.729
which is the corporations control it all,

634
00:28:48.729 --> 00:28:51.184
whether it's in the totalitarian countries

635
00:28:51.184 --> 00:28:52.953
or in the democratic countries.

636
00:28:52.953 --> 00:28:55.205
It's the big corporations that call the shots.

637
00:28:55.205 --> 00:28:56.860
So, we're seeing today in Washington,

638
00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.675
elected officials are no longer writing the laws,

639
00:28:59.675 --> 00:29:01.275
it's the lobbyists who write the laws,

640
00:29:01.275 --> 00:29:02.645
and they work for the corporations.

641
00:29:02.645 --> 00:29:05.425
They go through the hands of the elected officials,

642
00:29:05.425 --> 00:29:07.305
but the elected officials are

643
00:29:07.305 --> 00:29:08.678
beholden to the big corporations.

644
00:29:08.678 --> 00:29:10.523
<v ->That's the word corporatocracy, that's what we're in.</v>

645
00:29:10.523 --> 00:29:11.830
<v ->Corporatocracy, right.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

646
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:12.865
<v ->And we've certainly seen that</v>

647
00:29:12.865 --> 00:29:13.872
with the Obama administration.

648
00:29:13.872 --> 00:29:16.076
Here's a man who ran for President originally say,

649
00:29:16.076 --> 00:29:18.177
I'm not taking any money from corporate America.

650
00:29:18.177 --> 00:29:20.493
He took a lot of money form corporate America,

651
00:29:20.493 --> 00:29:23.020
and he's now totally beholden to corporate America,

652
00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.694
and we've seen that, and I'm not

653
00:29:24.694 --> 00:29:26.582
trying to come down hard on Obama.

654
00:29:26.582 --> 00:29:28.268
I realize he's very vulnerable.

655
00:29:28.268 --> 00:29:30.625
He's got tremendous obstacles.

656
00:29:30.625 --> 00:29:32.897
The point being that any President of the United States,

657
00:29:32.897 --> 00:29:35.008
Republican, Democrat, whatever,

658
00:29:35.008 --> 00:29:37.163
is under the thumb of corporations

659
00:29:37.163 --> 00:29:40.043
because we've entered this new era where the corporations,

660
00:29:40.043 --> 00:29:43.435
the corporatocracy, are the new emperors.

661
00:29:43.435 --> 00:29:45.878
They are calling the shots around the world.

662
00:29:45.878 --> 00:29:48.171
So, we need to look now where do we go from here.

663
00:29:48.171 --> 00:29:50.048
So, we went from religion to government

664
00:29:50.048 --> 00:29:52.821
to corporations, now, what's the next step?

665
00:29:52.821 --> 00:29:55.765
It has to be we the people, but for it to be

666
00:29:55.765 --> 00:29:58.709
we the people, we have to take control,

667
00:29:58.709 --> 00:30:00.660
and we need to understand that the way

668
00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.145
to take control is through the corporations.

669
00:30:03.145 --> 00:30:05.747
We don't need to take to the streets with arms anymore,

670
00:30:05.747 --> 00:30:08.190
as we did during the Vietnam War in high protest,

671
00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:10.926
because that's against government, it's against militaries.

672
00:30:10.926 --> 00:30:13.508
We need to take to the marketplace.

673
00:30:13.508 --> 00:30:16.250
We need to create a new economy.

674
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:19.107
We need to support corporations and entrepreneurs

675
00:30:19.107 --> 00:30:21.455
and individuals and local businesses

676
00:30:21.455 --> 00:30:23.887
that are determined to create a new economy,

677
00:30:23.887 --> 00:30:27.396
that moves out of the Milton Friedman definition,

678
00:30:27.396 --> 00:30:31.437
that the only business of business is to maximize profits

679
00:30:31.437 --> 00:30:33.773
regardless of social and environmental cost,

680
00:30:33.773 --> 00:30:37.795
and into a new understanding that it's okay to make profit,

681
00:30:37.795 --> 00:30:39.491
but only within the context of creating

682
00:30:39.491 --> 00:30:41.720
a sustainable just and peaceful world.

683
00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.875
We have to create a new playing field,

684
00:30:43.875 --> 00:30:46.478
and we have to say that we're only going to buy

685
00:30:46.478 --> 00:30:48.984
from those corporations that are committed

686
00:30:48.984 --> 00:30:51.650
to creating a sustainable just and peaceful world,

687
00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:54.561
to being good public servants, that a corporation

688
00:30:54.561 --> 00:30:57.069
is not just about maximizing profit.

689
00:30:57.069 --> 00:30:59.693
It's about being a good member of the community.

690
00:30:59.693 --> 00:31:02.732
It's about being a public, it's about serving the public,

691
00:31:02.732 --> 00:31:04.470
and they can make profits because that's

692
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:08.300
how you attract investors, but only within the context

693
00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.787
of taking on social and environmentally responsible actions.

694
00:31:11.787 --> 00:31:13.484
<v ->And what about the consumer themselves,</v>

695
00:31:13.484 --> 00:31:16.173
and like you say, the U.S. is five percent

696
00:31:16.173 --> 00:31:19.385
of the population consumes 25% of the world's resources.

697
00:31:19.385 --> 00:31:22.093
Isn't there an internal shift that has to take place

698
00:31:22.093 --> 00:31:23.864
where we just simply have to stop

699
00:31:23.864 --> 00:31:26.627
consuming more than we really need?

700
00:31:26.627 --> 00:31:27.927
We don't consume what we need.

701
00:31:27.927 --> 00:31:31.365
We're down to consuming what we want,

702
00:31:31.365 --> 00:31:32.870
and even in the middle class it's

703
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:34.607
been that way for a very long time.

704
00:31:34.607 --> 00:31:37.039
Cheap goods, I want it and it's gone.

705
00:31:37.039 --> 00:31:38.617
You know, you're done with it, tired of it,

706
00:31:38.617 --> 00:31:40.387
or it's falling apart within a month.

707
00:31:40.387 --> 00:31:43.267
<v ->This terrible consumer psyche</v>

708
00:31:43.267 --> 00:31:45.518
that we have is destroying us.

709
00:31:45.518 --> 00:31:48.441
It's destroying our planet and we need

710
00:31:48.441 --> 00:31:51.991
to be very aware of that, and the United States,

711
00:31:51.991 --> 00:31:54.178
less than 5% of the population of the world

712
00:31:54.178 --> 00:31:56.781
consuming more than 25% of its resources.

713
00:31:56.781 --> 00:31:59.288
One important understanding is that

714
00:31:59.288 --> 00:32:02.904
a lot of that is going into the military.

715
00:32:02.904 --> 00:32:05.484
And then a lot of the rest of it is going into junk,

716
00:32:05.484 --> 00:32:08.300
things we really don't need, and things that are bad for us.

717
00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.074
You know, Coca-Cola, soda pop,

718
00:32:11.074 --> 00:32:14.679
most of the foods we eat are pretty bad for us.

719
00:32:14.679 --> 00:32:16.769
So, how do we move beyond that?

720
00:32:16.769 --> 00:32:19.883
And how do we move to an understanding that

721
00:32:19.883 --> 00:32:23.808
a feudal system whereby five percent consume 25%

722
00:32:23.808 --> 00:32:26.635
is just not feasible and we don't want it.

723
00:32:26.635 --> 00:32:30.518
I don't want to be in that 5%, at all.

724
00:32:30.518 --> 00:32:34.976
And to recognize that as we move into a new future,

725
00:32:34.976 --> 00:32:38.571
we must address the very, very serious issue of poverty,

726
00:32:38.571 --> 00:32:43.104
and this is a crux because the corporations, as I mentioned,

727
00:32:43.104 --> 00:32:46.538
are based on this idea that you have to maximize profits,

728
00:32:46.538 --> 00:32:49.301
regardless of environmental and social cost.

729
00:32:49.301 --> 00:32:52.992
The second part of that idea is that

730
00:32:52.992 --> 00:32:55.988
keep people impoverished because big corporations

731
00:32:55.988 --> 00:32:58.814
benefit from poverty, and that's always been the case,

732
00:32:58.814 --> 00:33:03.188
where feudal lords have always benefitted from poverty.

733
00:33:03.188 --> 00:33:04.860
So, when people are impoverished,

734
00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:08.352
you can take advantage of them in so many ways.

735
00:33:08.352 --> 00:33:12.277
And of course, it's the big, big corporations, the Walmarts

736
00:33:12.277 --> 00:33:15.574
and so forth, that can cut prices on everything,

737
00:33:15.574 --> 00:33:17.354
and drive everybody else out of business,

738
00:33:17.354 --> 00:33:18.751
if they don't go along with them,

739
00:33:18.751 --> 00:33:21.770
and then sell to the poor because they have the lowest price

740
00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:24.832
and they usually sell pretty cheap goods in general to them.

741
00:33:24.832 --> 00:33:26.623
They exploit them in that way.

742
00:33:26.623 --> 00:33:29.385
But we also exploit them in the labor force,

743
00:33:29.385 --> 00:33:31.797
whether it's sweat shops in Indonesia,

744
00:33:31.797 --> 00:33:34.847
or telephone answering services in Pakistan.

745
00:33:34.847 --> 00:33:37.513
This tremendous exploitation of the poor,

746
00:33:37.513 --> 00:33:40.489
so, we all need to know that in order to change

747
00:33:40.489 --> 00:33:44.595
this paradigm, in order to create a new worldwide economy,

748
00:33:44.595 --> 00:33:47.912
we all have to embrace what we call the poor,

749
00:33:47.912 --> 00:33:49.630
the impoverished, and recognize that

750
00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:51.795
they're truly brothers and sisters.

751
00:33:51.795 --> 00:33:53.373
And most of us don't want to do that, you know.

752
00:33:53.373 --> 00:33:54.556
We really don't want to go out

753
00:33:54.556 --> 00:33:58.673
and touch lepers because we might get leprosy.

754
00:33:58.673 --> 00:34:01.179
Well, we're getting leprosy, we've got it.

755
00:34:01.179 --> 00:34:04.315
We've got a very, very sick leprosy-ridden--

756
00:34:04.315 --> 00:34:06.426
<v ->Eating away at our culture, yes.</v>

757
00:34:06.426 --> 00:34:10.488
<v ->Planet and culture, and it is having a huge impact.</v>

758
00:34:10.488 --> 00:34:13.175
We need to understand the deep psychological

759
00:34:13.175 --> 00:34:14.894
and emotional implications of that

760
00:34:14.894 --> 00:34:17.684
as well as the materialistic implications.

761
00:34:17.684 --> 00:34:19.989
<v ->And we need to develop, as you say in your book,</v>

762
00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:23.956
which I couldn't second more, and that is

763
00:34:23.956 --> 00:34:26.560
a sense of internal passion in ourselves.

764
00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.926
We've really lost that, that's given way

765
00:34:28.926 --> 00:34:30.709
in much of the western world to

766
00:34:30.709 --> 00:34:35.359
just either overwork, fear, or consumerism.

767
00:34:35.359 --> 00:34:36.939
And passion is what's going to fuel

768
00:34:36.939 --> 00:34:39.717
this internal shift within us to do something.

769
00:34:39.717 --> 00:34:41.329
Do you care to talk about that for a bit?

770
00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:45.466
<v ->Well, people often ask me, so what's the solution?</v>

771
00:34:51.999 --> 00:34:53.907
How do you answer a question like that?

772
00:34:53.907 --> 00:34:55.997
There's so many solutions, and you

773
00:34:55.997 --> 00:34:57.555
can kind of give general answers.

774
00:34:57.555 --> 00:34:59.902
In my book, "Hoodwinked," I outline five areas

775
00:34:59.902 --> 00:35:02.996
that all lead to the solution.

776
00:35:02.996 --> 00:35:04.970
But, when you come right down to it,

777
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:07.968
the solution has to be highly personal.

778
00:35:07.968 --> 00:35:11.967
We each have tremendous passion, and we each have talents,

779
00:35:11.967 --> 00:35:14.197
and I don't know what your passions and talents are.

780
00:35:14.197 --> 00:35:16.563
I know what mine are, I have a passion for writing,

781
00:35:16.563 --> 00:35:19.603
and hopefully a talent in it, but everybody has passion

782
00:35:19.603 --> 00:35:23.753
and talents, and the only way to really accomplish miracles,

783
00:35:23.753 --> 00:35:25.012
that's what we're talking about here,

784
00:35:25.012 --> 00:35:27.964
is to go into our passions and use our talents

785
00:35:27.964 --> 00:35:30.098
to head towards those miracles.

786
00:35:30.098 --> 00:35:32.284
And so, what I like to encourage everybody to do

787
00:35:32.284 --> 00:35:34.215
is follow your individual passion,

788
00:35:34.215 --> 00:35:38.998
if that's organizing

789
00:35:38.998 --> 00:35:40.402
consumer-responsible

790
00:35:40.402 --> 00:35:43.579
groups out on the street, if that's a consumer rebellions

791
00:35:43.579 --> 00:35:47.824
against Nike or Monsanto or somebody, do that.

792
00:35:47.824 --> 00:35:50.714
If your passion is teaching children

793
00:35:50.714 --> 00:35:53.817
about how to relate to each other, follow that passion.

794
00:35:53.817 --> 00:35:57.048
If your passion is helping Amazon rainforest,

795
00:35:57.048 --> 00:35:58.925
then join Pachamama Alliance or

796
00:35:58.925 --> 00:36:01.425
some other organization that's involved in that.

797
00:36:01.425 --> 00:36:04.614
But, look to your passion, what is your passion?

798
00:36:04.614 --> 00:36:09.020
And if we all really own up to our passions,

799
00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.665
and use our talents in the best possible way,

800
00:36:11.665 --> 00:36:14.587
but we all head for the same destination,

801
00:36:14.587 --> 00:36:17.584
which is a sustainable just and peaceful world,

802
00:36:17.584 --> 00:36:19.355
then we'll get there, and that's

803
00:36:19.355 --> 00:36:21.137
the only way we'll get there.

804
00:36:21.137 --> 00:36:23.781
We won't get there by thinking that when we elect

805
00:36:23.781 --> 00:36:27.066
an Obama or a Palin or whoever the heck we elect,

806
00:36:27.066 --> 00:36:29.637
they're gonna take us there because they're not.

807
00:36:29.637 --> 00:36:32.612
We have to do it, and that's always been the case,

808
00:36:32.612 --> 00:36:34.544
in democracy, when you come right down to it

809
00:36:34.544 --> 00:36:36.751
or even non-democracies, that's always been the case

810
00:36:36.751 --> 00:36:39.742
that the people have to make it happen.

811
00:36:41.091 --> 00:36:43.064
<v ->On that note, thank you so much for your time, John.</v>

812
00:36:43.064 --> 00:36:45.554
I know you're giving a talk in just a little bit.

813
00:36:45.554 --> 00:36:49.350
It's passion, and one thing, one other thing was you said,

814
00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:51.995
we need new poster boys and girls here.

815
00:36:51.995 --> 00:36:55.014
We can't afford to have Trumps, people like Donald Trump,

816
00:36:55.014 --> 00:37:00.009
gracing cultural as an icon, a cultural icon gracing the

817
00:37:00.009 --> 00:37:03.171
covers of anything as Man of the Year or anything else.

818
00:37:03.171 --> 00:37:07.821
This is really, in terms of kind of

819
00:37:07.821 --> 00:37:10.947
the brainwashing of the masses,

820
00:37:10.947 --> 00:37:13.155
this has a very deep psychological impact

821
00:37:13.155 --> 00:37:15.895
when you put up repeatedly for generation,

822
00:37:15.895 --> 00:37:18.680
a whole generation now, the notion that

823
00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:21.591
the people we should admire are those that have been able to

824
00:37:21.591 --> 00:37:24.513
essentially exploit the most and garner the most

825
00:37:24.513 --> 00:37:27.767
in terms of bottom-line and that's it, over.

826
00:37:27.767 --> 00:37:30.528
That has to be finished, we need new faces like yours.

827
00:37:30.528 --> 00:37:33.292
<v ->Yeah, well there's lots of good faces out there,</v>

828
00:37:33.292 --> 00:37:35.564
and we need to put them on the cover of our magazines.

829
00:37:35.564 --> 00:37:39.840
Get Donald Trump out of there, get Jack Welch out of there,

830
00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:43.879
and the media, what you people are doing,

831
00:37:43.879 --> 00:37:47.867
a documentary like this, these things are changing the world

832
00:37:47.867 --> 00:37:51.835
and I'm very hopeful cause I've seen a huge change

833
00:37:51.835 --> 00:37:54.321
in consciousness in the last six years since "Confessions"

834
00:37:54.321 --> 00:37:56.942
came out, especially in university campuses.

835
00:37:56.942 --> 00:37:59.821
So, I'm very hopeful that we are turning things around,

836
00:37:59.821 --> 00:38:01.892
and a lot of people will look at the last election,

837
00:38:01.892 --> 00:38:05.378
and say, oh my God, you know, it's reversing.

838
00:38:05.378 --> 00:38:07.138
But the fact of the matter is,

839
00:38:07.138 --> 00:38:09.719
when you start to make progress,

840
00:38:09.719 --> 00:38:12.835
the status quo digs in its heels real strong,

841
00:38:12.835 --> 00:38:14.338
and to me that's always a great

842
00:38:14.338 --> 00:38:17.315
sign that we're doing it right.

843
00:38:17.315 --> 00:38:20.205
The fact that there's so much resistance,

844
00:38:20.205 --> 00:38:22.061
for every action there's a reaction,

845
00:38:22.061 --> 00:38:23.873
and the reaction is so strong right now that that

846
00:38:23.873 --> 00:38:26.570
proves to you that the action itself is strong, too.

847
00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:29.908
We are turning the tide, and we just need to keep going,

848
00:38:29.908 --> 00:38:32.137
and we need to push harder and harder and harder,

849
00:38:32.137 --> 00:38:34.975
and never give up and never say it's too tough.

850
00:38:34.975 --> 00:38:38.152
Just say it's a challenge and that's what makes it fun.

851
00:38:38.152 --> 00:38:40.222
<v ->Indeed, well thank you for your incredible</v>

852
00:38:40.222 --> 00:38:43.465
historical vision and for your honesty,

853
00:38:43.465 --> 00:38:44.957
and also for the breadth of what

854
00:38:44.957 --> 00:38:47.049
you share with us in this by way of solutions,

855
00:38:47.049 --> 00:38:49.416
and I think it's a must-read for everybody.

856
00:38:49.416 --> 00:38:51.795
"Hoodwinked" is a must-read, so thank you so much, John.

857
00:38:51.795 --> 00:38:53.974
<v ->You're welcome, thank you.</v>

858
00:38:54.589 --> 00:38:56.605
<v ->Since his life as an economic hit man,</v>

00:38:56.605 --> 00:38:58.695
John Perkins has been dedicating his time

860
00:38:58.695 --> 00:39:01.640
toward the restoration of the environments we've damaged,

861
00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.103
as well as the restoration of democracy.

862
00:39:04.103 --> 00:39:06.662
Many of these solutions are outlined in "Hoodwinked,"

863
00:39:06.662 --> 00:39:08.818
which you can find at any major bookseller.

864
00:39:08.818 --> 00:39:10.652
You may also want to read, "Confessions

865
00:39:10.652 --> 00:39:13.275
of an Economic Hit Man," first as background.

866
00:39:13.275 --> 00:39:15.803
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
