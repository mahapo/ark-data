00:00:00.451 --> 00:00:02.301
(new age music)

2
00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:14.467
<v ->We recently met with Michael St. Claire</v>

3
00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:16.899
in southern France to have a face to face discussion

4
00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:19.587
about what's around the corner for the global economy.

5
00:00:19.587 --> 00:00:22.979
He spoke of gold soaring above 1300 dollars an ounce

6
00:00:22.979 --> 00:00:24.803
which it did a few days later.

7
00:00:24.803 --> 00:00:27.907
And he says that it's now headed towards 2,000 dollars.

8
00:00:27.907 --> 00:00:30.307
This is not so much to do with the value of the metal.

9
00:00:30.307 --> 00:00:33.859
Rather, the decline of the value of the world's currencies.

10
00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:36.227
In response to a global economic downturn,

11
00:00:36.227 --> 00:00:37.795
Michael and I discussed the imperative

12
00:00:37.795 --> 00:00:40.931
that each one of us choose the place we call home,

13
00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:43.427
our relationships and the means of thriving

14
00:00:43.427 --> 00:00:44.867
through the times ahead.

15
00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:48.349
He calls it the path of living in radiant zones.

16
00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:04.355
Well, finally we get to meet in person

17
00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:05.539
here in Southern France.

18
00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:06.947
Last time we were on Skype

19
00:01:06.947 --> 00:01:08.323
and you were in Frankfurt.

20
00:01:08.323 --> 00:01:10.051
And now we're in a lovely backyard

21
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:11.235
in Avignon.

22
00:01:11.235 --> 00:01:14.435
It's perfect that it worked out this way

23
00:01:14.435 --> 00:01:16.547
because this area, even land

24
00:01:16.547 --> 00:01:18.179
imparts a certain kind of energy

25
00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:20.579
that creates this wonderful kind of connection

26
00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.747
to be able to talk about some of the more

27
00:01:23.747 --> 00:01:26.051
profound things that we're moving into.

28
00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:28.035
And let's just,

29
00:01:28.035 --> 00:01:30.435
I would like to move into the subject

30
00:01:30.435 --> 00:01:33.571
of radiant zones, ultimately.

31
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:38.571
But let's back up a little bit with the times.

32
00:01:38.755 --> 00:01:40.419
A lot of people are familiar with what you did

33
00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:41.443
at the beginning of the year.

34
00:01:41.443 --> 00:01:43.299
Talking with George Nori in Coast to Coast

35
00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.307
because you, as with your friend Cliff Hye,

36
00:01:46.307 --> 00:01:48.483
do forecast for the times coming.

37
00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:51.172
And because these are such interesting,

38
00:01:51.172 --> 00:01:54.179
transformative and kind of dicey times,

39
00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.163
if you look at it from a humanistic level,

40
00:01:56.163 --> 00:01:58.755
you had a lot to say at that time.

41
00:01:58.755 --> 00:02:00.163
We're ten months in now.

42
00:02:00.163 --> 00:02:02.019
Can you just pick it up from here right now

43
00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:04.771
in terms of some of the overarching trends

44
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:07.075
that have been playing out since you talked

45
00:02:07.075 --> 00:02:09.411
to George Nori that we're looking at.

46
00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:11.331
And then we'll start diving in to some depth

47
00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.059
about the background.

48
00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:16.323
<v ->Ok, well first of all it was ten months</v>

49
00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:17.347
plus a year.

50
00:02:17.347 --> 00:02:20.675
It was early January, very, very early.

51
00:02:20.675 --> 00:02:23.459
Opening days of 2009.

52
00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.451
And that's ok because-

53
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:25.443
<v Regina>Yeah, that's right.</v>

54
00:02:25.443 --> 00:02:28.035
That was a time gap for me.

55
00:02:28.035 --> 00:02:29.283
It was a year prior.

56
00:02:29.283 --> 00:02:32.387
<v ->Well it is that time is playing tricks on us.</v>

57
00:02:32.387 --> 00:02:33.635
So that's the first answer.

58
00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:37.475
So we're living through this time phenomena.

59
00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:40.707
Like for instance, an errand that typically takes

60
00:02:40.707 --> 00:02:42.276
about an hour,

61
00:02:42.276 --> 00:02:45.283
can via clock time on several clocks

62
00:02:45.283 --> 00:02:46.883
simultaneously be looked at,

63
00:02:46.883 --> 00:02:49.091
that is really only 20 minutes.

64
00:02:49.091 --> 00:02:51.747
And conversely it can also lead through the opposite

65
00:02:51.747 --> 00:02:54.243
that all of a sudden time seems to expand

66
00:02:54.243 --> 00:02:59.171
and we don't feel that something's moving.

67
00:02:59.171 --> 00:03:01.859
So that's about this ten months plus one year.

68
00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.811
What has happened since that we discussed

69
00:03:03.811 --> 00:03:06.083
with Cliff and George Nori is

70
00:03:06.083 --> 00:03:07.683
in my case I'm more into the economy

71
00:03:07.683 --> 00:03:09.379
because I just like to

72
00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.739
have people look at things that they can go out

73
00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:13.859
and measure.

74
00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.291
Because I know people like facts, proof.

75
00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:18.179
That's just the way the linear mind works.

76
00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:22.691
And we are now today on this equinox day,

77
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:26.083
full moon, the 22nd of September,

78
00:03:26.083 --> 00:03:28.131
at the point where we are going through

79
00:03:28.131 --> 00:03:32.067
1300 dollars per ounce for the gold price.

80
00:03:32.067 --> 00:03:33.795
This morning was 1293.

81
00:03:33.795 --> 00:03:36.899
I think this week we're going to go past 1300.

82
00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:39.107
That's something I clearly explained.

83
00:03:39.107 --> 00:03:41.379
That gold will become the currency.

84
00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.289
Gold is the currency of the world.

85
00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:47.088
That's one of the things that has now happened.

86
00:03:47.088 --> 00:03:49.392
Towards the end of 2010.

87
00:03:49.392 --> 00:03:53.648
<v Regina>And at that time unto the beginning of 2009,</v>

88
00:03:53.648 --> 00:03:54.352
where was it?

89
00:03:54.352 --> 00:03:58.417
Was it still hovering, six, seven, eight hundred something?

90
00:03:58.417 --> 00:04:03.024
<v ->Oh, then it was around 900.</v>

91
00:04:03.024 --> 00:04:03.856
<v Regina>It was up to nine?</v>

92
00:04:03.856 --> 00:04:06.704
<v ->The structure I think in the eight, nine hundreds.</v>

93
00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:08.368
For about a good year,

94
00:04:08.368 --> 00:04:12.112
we actually gone through a thousand two times.

95
00:04:12.112 --> 00:04:15.088
And the other expert, James Sinclair,

96
00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:17.456
had very precisely predicted that it would knock

97
00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:20.752
three times at the door of 1,000.

98
00:04:20.752 --> 00:04:23.056
And on the third attempt,

99
00:04:23.056 --> 00:04:24.784
which was in September of last year,

100
00:04:24.784 --> 00:04:26.032
exactly a year ago,

101
00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:27.216
that would be the final moment.

102
00:04:27.216 --> 00:04:28.529
From then on, it would never go back

103
00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:30.224
down below 1,000.

104
00:04:30.224 --> 00:04:31.888
<v Regina>And really, 1250 was kind of</v>

105
00:04:31.888 --> 00:04:33.712
a threshold at which things were really

106
00:04:33.712 --> 00:04:38.001
going to shift economically on a profound level.

107
00:04:38.001 --> 00:04:39.824
And so explain that to us now

108
00:04:39.824 --> 00:04:43.280
because we can go into a lot of the esoteric factors

109
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.496
behind the times.

110
00:04:44.496 --> 00:04:46.992
But right now, it's affecting everybody

111
00:04:46.992 --> 00:04:48.816
in their own home.

112
00:04:48.816 --> 00:04:50.128
The economy is affecting everyone.

113
00:04:50.128 --> 00:04:52.656
So I agree with you, it's a very practical place to go.

114
00:04:52.656 --> 00:04:55.184
So let's talk about this threshold being passed now,

115
00:04:55.184 --> 00:04:56.272
1300 with gold.

116
00:04:56.272 --> 00:04:58.608
What's this really mean?

117
00:04:58.608 --> 00:05:02.352
<v ->Ok, what it means apart from the funny numbers is,</v>

118
00:05:02.352 --> 00:05:04.240
lemme say quickly something first.

119
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.856
When in 1913, the federal reserve was created,

120
00:05:07.856 --> 00:05:11.120
which is merely a club of international

121
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.784
global banking families,

122
00:05:12.784 --> 00:05:15.472
you have the dollar at some place.

123
00:05:15.472 --> 00:05:18.897
But that was a takeover of all of the currencies.

124
00:05:18.897 --> 00:05:23.897
And now 97 years later, the currency is worse

125
00:05:24.208 --> 00:05:25.904
maybe about 3%.

126
00:05:25.904 --> 00:05:27.856
So one could say that in average,

127
00:05:27.856 --> 00:05:31.056
per one year, one percent of the currency gets lost.

128
00:05:31.056 --> 00:05:32.753
And normally one says among experts

129
00:05:32.753 --> 00:05:35.472
the currency does not last more than,

130
00:05:35.472 --> 00:05:38.704
say two Saturn cycles, 60, 70 years maximum,

131
00:05:38.704 --> 00:05:41.501
so 90, 100 year cycle for currency

132
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:44.797
is already an artificial occurence.

133
00:05:44.797 --> 00:05:46.685
So to answer the question, it means

134
00:05:46.685 --> 00:05:50.333
we're seeing that when gold hits 1300, 1600

135
00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:52.061
in January of 2011,

136
00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:55.165
that the currencies have no more value.

137
00:05:55.165 --> 00:05:58.493
So what people must understand is that

138
00:05:58.493 --> 00:06:01.469
the price of gold is not the value of gold.

139
00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:03.453
So this figure that one looks at

140
00:06:03.453 --> 00:06:06.269
does not mean that gold goes up.

141
00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:07.869
Gold is just gold.

142
00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:12.869
What one reads is how the currencies are disintegrating.

143
00:06:13.245 --> 00:06:15.069
So the higher that price level is,

144
00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:19.453
the lower the confidence in all the currencies is.

145
00:06:19.453 --> 00:06:21.373
And that's not just dollar, that's also euro.

146
00:06:21.373 --> 00:06:24.702
That's actually compared to any currency in the world,

147
00:06:24.702 --> 00:06:26.750
gold wins.

148
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.662
<v Regina>But this threshold that you're talking about,</v>

149
00:06:29.662 --> 00:06:33.213
as you say, it goes through two Saturnian cycles normally,

150
00:06:33.213 --> 00:06:36.158
and we're already another Saturnian cycle beyond that.

151
00:06:36.158 --> 00:06:39.357
And it would seem, even with the price of gold as it is,

152
00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:41.725
because we've been hearing for the last tow or three years

153
00:06:41.725 --> 00:06:44.669
that gold should've been over 2000 realistically,

154
00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:47.326
if you're looking at the actual value of the currencies

155
00:06:47.326 --> 00:06:48.349
of the world.

156
00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:50.654
The currencies of the world are just being manipulated.

157
00:06:50.654 --> 00:06:52.253
<v ->Yes, of course they are manipulated.</v>

158
00:06:52.253 --> 00:06:55.197
Actually gold would be at 2,200 now

159
00:06:55.197 --> 00:06:58.813
just based on inflation of 1980.

160
00:06:58.813 --> 00:07:01.245
The actual value is 2,200.

161
00:07:01.245 --> 00:07:03.901
And it will get there very quickly.

162
00:07:03.901 --> 00:07:07.069
<v Regina>Again, in the streets, practical level.</v>

163
00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:10.461
Wall Street and beyond City of London and beyond.

164
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:14.109
How long can the players that are playing

165
00:07:14.109 --> 00:07:17.181
continue to artificially manipulate all of this?

166
00:07:17.181 --> 00:07:19.422
I thought it would have been kinda over with

167
00:07:19.422 --> 00:07:20.989
a year or so ago.

168
00:07:20.989 --> 00:07:22.109
<v ->That's a very good question</v>

169
00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:24.061
and I don't understand it either.

170
00:07:24.061 --> 00:07:26.557
I have asked many experts and we just

171
00:07:26.557 --> 00:07:28.253
really always speechless.

172
00:07:28.253 --> 00:07:30.493
You are right, it should have stopped a year ago.

173
00:07:30.493 --> 00:07:32.317
And so I cannot answer it.

174
00:07:32.317 --> 00:07:34.237
If I would say, well in a year it would be over,

175
00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:35.773
I may be proven wrong.

176
00:07:35.773 --> 00:07:37.917
And I don't know also how they do this.

177
00:07:37.917 --> 00:07:39.581
This is beyond me.

178
00:07:39.581 --> 00:07:41.117
But we're just glad to see the gold

179
00:07:41.117 --> 00:07:42.941
is getting to the real value.

180
00:07:42.941 --> 00:07:44.733
And we know that,

181
00:07:44.733 --> 00:07:47.421
not only with Cliff Heibert,

182
00:07:47.421 --> 00:07:48.829
with all the friends.

183
00:07:48.829 --> 00:07:51.421
I know that this game is, astrologically speaking,

184
00:07:51.421 --> 00:07:56.029
up by let's say 2020 at the very latest.

185
00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:58.717
I have a tendency to look at larger cycles,

186
00:07:58.717 --> 00:08:00.189
born with Saturn and Capricorn,

187
00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:02.333
so I see more the long count.

188
00:08:02.333 --> 00:08:05.981
And in ten years, this game is definitely over.

189
00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:07.837
<v Regina>And some are saying maybe in two years.</v>

190
00:08:07.837 --> 00:08:09.469
So it's somewhere in there.

191
00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:11.422
<v ->And I think we should not get hung up on these</v>

192
00:08:11.422 --> 00:08:12.701
timing things.

193
00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:14.461
That has to do with what I said in the beginning

194
00:08:14.461 --> 00:08:17.310
about how we actually experience time.

195
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.749
We should just keep our eye on the ball

196
00:08:18.749 --> 00:08:20.349
of what we are doing.

197
00:08:20.349 --> 00:08:22.781
Always be focused on us,

198
00:08:22.781 --> 00:08:25.693
on what we do with our lives, with our work.

199
00:08:25.693 --> 00:08:28.221
Careers, what we are about,

200
00:08:28.221 --> 00:08:32.221
and not look outside and figure surprises.

201
00:08:32.221 --> 00:08:33.789
Just don't look outside so much.

202
00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:37.181
Look in yourself and act from inside.

203
00:08:37.181 --> 00:08:38.589
<v Regina>And on that note,</v>

204
00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:40.477
could it be,

205
00:08:40.477 --> 00:08:42.269
and this is what we'll get into in a moment,

206
00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:45.149
is external forces that have been manipulating,

207
00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:47.549
interfering, and also helping humanity

208
00:08:47.549 --> 00:08:50.461
from the very beginning of humanity.

209
00:08:50.461 --> 00:08:54.461
Is it possible that in some bizzare way,

210
00:08:54.461 --> 00:08:57.469
the manipulation of these currencies,

211
00:08:57.469 --> 00:09:00.125
slowing down this process while at the same time,

212
00:09:00.125 --> 00:09:02.333
the expansion of awareness and knowledge

213
00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:03.998
is growing very rapidly,

214
00:09:03.998 --> 00:09:06.269
is actually creating some kind of grace

215
00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:08.637
and some kind of buffer for people

216
00:09:08.637 --> 00:09:11.805
to be able to respond or prepare?

217
00:09:11.805 --> 00:09:14.218
<v ->Well said, I completely agree with that.</v>

218
00:09:14.218 --> 00:09:17.258
I just discussed this this morning with a friend.

219
00:09:17.258 --> 00:09:19.594
And that's what I feel.

220
00:09:19.594 --> 00:09:22.410
We are given almost like a last chance

221
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.834
to catch up internally by awareness,

222
00:09:25.834 --> 00:09:27.786
intellectually at the linear mind.

223
00:09:27.786 --> 00:09:31.178
But also psychically retune ourselves into the guidance

224
00:09:31.178 --> 00:09:32.426
that we have.

225
00:09:32.426 --> 00:09:33.770
That's exactly right.

226
00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.690
We're probably given another additional year

227
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:36.810
to two years

228
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.466
to really grasp what it's about.

229
00:09:39.466 --> 00:09:41.002
And the economy is of course

230
00:09:41.002 --> 00:09:42.762
a very important outside factor

231
00:09:42.762 --> 00:09:44.234
because that affects our life

232
00:09:44.234 --> 00:09:45.514
for everything that we do.

233
00:09:45.514 --> 00:09:47.338
There are other things that we have

234
00:09:47.338 --> 00:09:49.642
a few more moments in time to catch up with.

235
00:09:49.642 --> 00:09:52.555
Climate changes, weather changes,

236
00:09:52.555 --> 00:09:54.698
what this all means in practical terms for us.

237
00:09:54.698 --> 00:09:57.674
And I often say things could already be now

238
00:09:57.674 --> 00:09:58.762
much worse.

239
00:09:58.762 --> 00:10:00.842
When followed down these timelines

240
00:10:00.842 --> 00:10:04.202
that Cliff and I were talking about.

241
00:10:04.202 --> 00:10:07.319
I'm positively surprised to see

242
00:10:07.319 --> 00:10:10.135
that it's not at all as bad as it could've been.

243
00:10:10.135 --> 00:10:12.695
This is why I know, forward to the other point

244
00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:15.127
that we do have a guidance

245
00:10:15.127 --> 00:10:17.591
or actually beings of force, a presence.

246
00:10:17.591 --> 00:10:20.439
There is a presence that helps us

247
00:10:20.439 --> 00:10:25.143
to at least mitigate what's going on.

248
00:10:25.143 --> 00:10:27.959
And at best actually take initiatives.

249
00:10:27.959 --> 00:10:30.647
So there is a presence making sure,

250
00:10:30.647 --> 00:10:32.664
to say it in a simple way,

251
00:10:32.664 --> 00:10:34.743
that things are not as bad as it could be.

252
00:10:34.743 --> 00:10:37.271
For instance, the gulf spill.

253
00:10:37.271 --> 00:10:39.767
I think it would have been a complete disaster.

254
00:10:39.767 --> 00:10:41.015
And of course I can't prove it

255
00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:43.639
but I think something else intervened

256
00:10:43.639 --> 00:10:46.295
to make it less of a catastrophe.

257
00:10:46.295 --> 00:10:47.863
<v Regina>Well certainly on a number of levels</v>

258
00:10:47.863 --> 00:10:49.585
it seems to be a mystery.

259
00:10:49.585 --> 00:10:51.281
That certain aspects of it are clearing

260
00:10:51.281 --> 00:10:53.233
as quickly as it is.

261
00:10:53.233 --> 00:10:55.102
I mean there's still the devastation,

262
00:10:55.102 --> 00:10:57.936
There's still health issues along the gulf coast

263
00:10:57.936 --> 00:10:58.930
states and so forth.

264
00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:00.306
It's not good,

265
00:11:00.306 --> 00:11:02.002
but as you say, again,

266
00:11:02.002 --> 00:11:04.370
it could have been even more devastating.

267
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:07.794
And while at one time you're looking at some motives

268
00:11:07.794 --> 00:11:10.322
or agendas of the beings that are manipulating

269
00:11:10.322 --> 00:11:13.330
the moneys and the markets for their own benefit,

270
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.442
I mean they think that yes, we've got this.

271
00:11:15.442 --> 00:11:17.106
We've got a little more time to operate.

272
00:11:17.106 --> 00:11:19.282
They're actually the ones that are helping create

273
00:11:19.282 --> 00:11:21.010
the time for everybody else to operate

274
00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:22.194
and prepare as well.

275
00:11:22.194 --> 00:11:23.538
Inadvertently.

276
00:11:23.538 --> 00:11:24.466
I mean, I love that.

277
00:11:24.466 --> 00:11:26.194
I love it when you get kind of

278
00:11:26.194 --> 00:11:29.202
a secondary passed on benefit. (laughing)

279
00:11:29.202 --> 00:11:30.418
I love this kind of thing.

280
00:11:30.418 --> 00:11:32.178
<v ->It's like getting a second reality.</v>

281
00:11:32.178 --> 00:11:33.362
That's right.

282
00:11:33.362 --> 00:11:36.434
I strongly believe that there is a presence.

283
00:11:36.434 --> 00:11:37.683
I mean, I know, I should say.

284
00:11:37.683 --> 00:11:40.786
I know there is a presence that helps us

285
00:11:40.786 --> 00:11:42.418
become aware, first of all,

286
00:11:42.418 --> 00:11:43.410
of what's going on.

287
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.810
That's just already the best thing.

288
00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.378
We can always be aware of it.

289
00:11:47.378 --> 00:11:49.330
Once we're aware, I think we can then,

290
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.834
we have the solutions right away.

291
00:11:50.834 --> 00:11:53.970
<v Regina>So let's talk about,</v>

292
00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:56.658
during this period of time that we have,

293
00:11:56.658 --> 00:11:58.066
this grace period.

294
00:11:58.066 --> 00:12:00.787
Another, whatever the length of time is we have

295
00:12:00.787 --> 00:12:04.018
to start reconsidering economies,

296
00:12:04.018 --> 00:12:07.282
reconsidering what has value

297
00:12:07.282 --> 00:12:08.466
and what doesn't.

298
00:12:08.466 --> 00:12:11.058
This is where a lot of your work starts coming in now

299
00:12:11.058 --> 00:12:13.394
is the consciousness that needs to be seeded

300
00:12:13.394 --> 00:12:15.634
to create the next evolution.

301
00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:19.154
You call them radiant zones.

302
00:12:19.154 --> 00:12:22.770
You can go down any pathway to get to that.

303
00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.626
But please, from here, explain

304
00:12:24.626 --> 00:12:26.898
how it's best to utilize this time

305
00:12:26.898 --> 00:12:30.674
perception-wise and otherwise, practically.

306
00:12:30.674 --> 00:12:33.234
<v ->Ok, the term radiant zones to me</v>

307
00:12:33.234 --> 00:12:36.819
means simply that we are, you, I,

308
00:12:36.819 --> 00:12:39.506
we are a radiant zone from inside.

309
00:12:39.506 --> 00:12:42.227
And then people who studied my work

310
00:12:42.227 --> 00:12:45.746
will see, of course everybody wants to see the outside.

311
00:12:45.746 --> 00:12:48.882
And they see the radiant zones as a geographical place

312
00:12:48.882 --> 00:12:51.154
where we have our self sustained life

313
00:12:51.154 --> 00:12:53.586
and are self organized, et cetera.

314
00:12:53.586 --> 00:12:57.554
But the radiant zone is an internal state of mind

315
00:12:57.554 --> 00:12:59.090
or state of being.

316
00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:02.066
And we have this time, like I said,

317
00:13:02.066 --> 00:13:05.970
maybe two years, 2012, 2013, about there,

318
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.050
to get ready.

319
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:11.890
By getting ready, I mean internally getting ready first.

320
00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.394
Once we're internally ready,

321
00:13:13.394 --> 00:13:16.723
meaning we're able to connect with the guidance,

322
00:13:16.723 --> 00:13:19.730
have a dialog with these beings with ourselves,

323
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:23.730
getting ready maybe with friends or same wavelengths

324
00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.490
to create networks.

325
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:27.634
It's very important that we're networked.

326
00:13:27.634 --> 00:13:31.250
Which means I am not for being organized.

327
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.170
I say this often to clients and friends.

328
00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.666
I don't want to see a new organization.

329
00:13:35.666 --> 00:13:38.035
We're not reorganizing humanity.

330
00:13:38.035 --> 00:13:41.522
That was tried over and over for tens of thousands of years

331
00:13:41.522 --> 00:13:42.994
and we know where that leads.

332
00:13:42.994 --> 00:13:44.818
But it's to get internally ready,

333
00:13:44.818 --> 00:13:47.474
create networks, create this awareness.

334
00:13:47.474 --> 00:13:50.130
And then of course use the time on a practical level

335
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.562
to make certain preparations.

336
00:13:52.562 --> 00:13:54.354
Because the climate changes are real.

337
00:13:54.354 --> 00:13:55.379
All these things are happening

338
00:13:55.379 --> 00:13:57.810
and at any time there can be quakes,

339
00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:59.538
situations with weather, et cetera.

340
00:13:59.538 --> 00:14:00.530
And that is happening.

341
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:02.578
That is realistically the case.

342
00:14:02.578 --> 00:14:05.202
And at any moment your outside circumstances

343
00:14:05.202 --> 00:14:08.114
can, literally overnight,go upside down.

344
00:14:08.114 --> 00:14:12.146
So you do need to get physically ready at a certain level.

345
00:14:12.146 --> 00:14:15.122
As well as mentally, as well as you know, emotionally,

346
00:14:15.122 --> 00:14:16.915
internally getting ready.

347
00:14:16.915 --> 00:14:18.163
<v Regina>Cliff Hye talks about this.</v>

348
00:14:18.163 --> 00:14:19.666
You and Cliff are great friends.

349
00:14:19.666 --> 00:14:22.290
<v ->Yeah, we're still refining ourselves.</v>

350
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.914
<v Regina>Yes, I understand what you're saying</v>

351
00:14:24.914 --> 00:14:25.842
about the networks.

352
00:14:25.842 --> 00:14:27.442
It's really something that has to be

353
00:14:27.442 --> 00:14:29.138
almost organic in nature.

354
00:14:29.138 --> 00:14:30.258
<v ->Right, organic.</v>

355
00:14:30.258 --> 00:14:32.082
<v Regina>Not controlled, no president,</v>

356
00:14:32.082 --> 00:14:34.770
vice president, secretary. (laughing)

357
00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.914
Just an organic coming together of thought,

358
00:14:36.914 --> 00:14:39.090
and purpose and so forth, right?

359
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:40.882
<v ->Yes, and that happens organically.</v>

360
00:14:40.882 --> 00:14:42.578
It just happens or it does not happen.

361
00:14:42.578 --> 00:14:47.578
It depends on how you're tuned in to the,

362
00:14:48.306 --> 00:14:50.002
the guidance, the presence.

363
00:14:50.002 --> 00:14:51.890
I prefer the term the presence.

364
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.322
<v Regina>So this brings me to Cliff Hye,</v>

365
00:14:54.322 --> 00:14:56.050
because you're great friends, and also

366
00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:58.962
you compare your own perceptions

367
00:14:58.962 --> 00:15:01.715
and his work with web bots and so forth.

368
00:15:01.715 --> 00:15:03.794
This earth change thing comes up a lot

369
00:15:03.794 --> 00:15:05.202
for both of you.

370
00:15:05.202 --> 00:15:07.282
This is something that I think

371
00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:09.618
anyone paying attention and the least

372
00:15:09.618 --> 00:15:11.282
understands that the weather patterns

373
00:15:11.282 --> 00:15:13.362
have been upside down in 2010.

374
00:15:13.362 --> 00:15:14.962
<v ->Yeah, so that's obviously-</v>

375
00:15:14.962 --> 00:15:16.242
<v Regina>And earthquake activity</v>

376
00:15:16.242 --> 00:15:18.098
<v ->looking at this already for ten years at the least.</v>

377
00:15:18.098 --> 00:15:20.498
He has been looking at it even longer than I did.

378
00:15:20.498 --> 00:15:23.123
In a written manner that can be proven.

379
00:15:23.123 --> 00:15:25.938
And he's correct on the overall trend.

380
00:15:25.938 --> 00:15:27.679
The only thing that one has to understand,

381
00:15:27.679 --> 00:15:29.471
and I've studied for years and years

382
00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:31.391
so I know how to read it.

383
00:15:31.391 --> 00:15:33.375
Most people have gone to this later

384
00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:37.997
and they look at it again in a sort of a

385
00:15:37.997 --> 00:15:40.960
perceptional way into the phenomenon.

386
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.399
And they don't think further.

387
00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:43.871
But he says clearly

388
00:15:43.871 --> 00:15:46.879
that his method does not mean

389
00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:48.735
it's going to be like it's written.

390
00:15:48.735 --> 00:15:50.820
And it's also not his opinion that he writes.

391
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.948
People have to discern better, make a distinction.

392
00:15:54.948 --> 00:15:58.884
And he also says that he's about correct half of the time.

393
00:15:58.884 --> 00:16:01.028
And anyway it's not about being correct either.

394
00:16:01.028 --> 00:16:02.884
It's just, we're measuring the trends.

395
00:16:02.884 --> 00:16:04.740
Of course we're comparing notes.

396
00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.564
I do it via astrology.

397
00:16:06.564 --> 00:16:09.092
And he's oftentimes said, if astrology's correct,

398
00:16:09.092 --> 00:16:10.660
and he's reading off the words,

399
00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.700
so either bots must be correct and kind of vice versa.

400
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.516
And he also says, and that's the most important point

401
00:16:16.516 --> 00:16:20.452
why I always talk about longer terms.

402
00:16:20.452 --> 00:16:22.340
He talks about four generations.

403
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.700
That's one whole cycle, 84 years,

404
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.109
a hundred years maybe.

405
00:16:27.109 --> 00:16:28.708
We're looking at longer cycles.

406
00:16:28.708 --> 00:16:30.404
Although we speak and write about

407
00:16:30.404 --> 00:16:32.325
always these short term increments of

408
00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.596
a few months, a year, two years.

409
00:16:34.596 --> 00:16:37.156
I personally prefer to take the longer term.

410
00:16:37.156 --> 00:16:39.525
We have to see where we fit into all of this.

411
00:16:39.525 --> 00:16:41.828
Otherwise we get again ourselves hung up

412
00:16:41.828 --> 00:16:44.836
on small term thinking.

413
00:16:44.836 --> 00:16:47.076
And I don't find this useful for us.

414
00:16:47.076 --> 00:16:49.220
So on the whole, I agree with him.

415
00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:53.060
However, I would say, things tend to not

416
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.260
pan out as intensely as he reads in his reports.

417
00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.700
<v Regina>So how would you read it right now?</v>

418
00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.460
When we're looking at this scenario of earth changes

419
00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.548
over the next few years?

420
00:17:00.548 --> 00:17:02.308
<v ->Yeah so I would say that,</v>

421
00:17:02.308 --> 00:17:04.324
like I said in the beginning that was this presence

422
00:17:04.324 --> 00:17:06.277
and the guidance we are given

423
00:17:06.277 --> 00:17:07.940
a number of chances.

424
00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.820
And this presence is also in some way

425
00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:15.820
making sure that it doesn't turn out as bad as it could.

426
00:17:16.049 --> 00:17:18.801
We are on a not good path.

427
00:17:18.801 --> 00:17:20.337
And that's fact.

428
00:17:20.337 --> 00:17:22.353
I'm trying here to be polite and so on

429
00:17:22.353 --> 00:17:24.434
but we are down a very slippery slope

430
00:17:24.434 --> 00:17:27.090
and it's not gonna end very well for some.

431
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:29.873
The weather patters, the climate,

432
00:17:29.873 --> 00:17:33.361
all the things, the phenomenology,

433
00:17:33.361 --> 00:17:35.505
the things that we can touch, see, measure.

434
00:17:35.505 --> 00:17:37.073
They don't look very good.

435
00:17:37.073 --> 00:17:39.857
There are other things where we have more influence.

436
00:17:39.857 --> 00:17:43.025
And that has to do with what we do about ourselves.

437
00:17:43.025 --> 00:17:46.033
Not in a sense of how we react to what's going to happen

438
00:17:46.033 --> 00:17:48.785
outside, but how we are internally predisposed

439
00:17:48.785 --> 00:17:51.153
to deal with what's going on.

440
00:17:51.153 --> 00:17:53.681
And that is almost an energetic work.

441
00:17:53.681 --> 00:17:56.817
Where we could become energy workers.

442
00:17:56.817 --> 00:17:58.865
We work with the energy,. with ourselves,

443
00:17:58.865 --> 00:18:00.753
with other's energies.

444
00:18:00.753 --> 00:18:02.705
And then the events, the actual

445
00:18:02.705 --> 00:18:06.417
point by point events, trends and happenings

446
00:18:06.417 --> 00:18:07.665
are irrelevant.

447
00:18:07.665 --> 00:18:10.993
This is why maybe my line of thought

448
00:18:10.993 --> 00:18:12.817
and Cliff's are a little bit different.

449
00:18:12.817 --> 00:18:14.449
But I say at the end of the day,

450
00:18:14.449 --> 00:18:17.617
all these human affairs, economic,

451
00:18:17.617 --> 00:18:20.273
political things are absolutely irrelevant.

452
00:18:20.273 --> 00:18:22.129
And I always say to my clients and friends,

453
00:18:22.129 --> 00:18:25.617
just really focus on you and not out there.

454
00:18:25.617 --> 00:18:28.113
Sure, we use the out there as time markers,

455
00:18:28.113 --> 00:18:29.649
as sort of goal posts.

456
00:18:29.649 --> 00:18:32.881
We'll say ok when that red stick comes

457
00:18:32.881 --> 00:18:34.449
you take a left turn and over there

458
00:18:34.449 --> 00:18:37.553
we're gonna come to blue stick and take a right turn.

459
00:18:37.553 --> 00:18:39.825
When these markers indeed happen,

460
00:18:39.825 --> 00:18:41.905
we know, we're more or less on the path

461
00:18:41.905 --> 00:18:43.249
that we have designed.

462
00:18:43.249 --> 00:18:46.065
And you know this could change overnight.

463
00:18:46.065 --> 00:18:48.305
So I'm very self-critical in the sense

464
00:18:48.305 --> 00:18:50.641
that I'm prepared to know that I'm wake up

465
00:18:50.641 --> 00:18:52.785
tomorrow morning and everything's upside down

466
00:18:52.785 --> 00:18:54.865
and not at all the way that I thought.

467
00:18:54.865 --> 00:18:56.657
And I want to say this to people.

468
00:18:56.657 --> 00:18:58.610
Please be aware that it could just

469
00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.233
from one day to the next, be completely different

470
00:19:01.233 --> 00:19:03.665
than yourself, with your best training

471
00:19:03.665 --> 00:19:06.129
thought you knew it would be.

472
00:19:06.129 --> 00:19:07.441
Be ready for that.

473
00:19:07.441 --> 00:19:10.225
That's also gonna be part of the big changes.

474
00:19:10.225 --> 00:19:13.265
So much is in reality of a completely different kind.

475
00:19:13.265 --> 00:19:13.937
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

476
00:19:13.937 --> 00:19:15.953
And you're not into, 2012,

477
00:19:15.953 --> 00:19:17.969
that's not what you're talking about here.

478
00:19:17.969 --> 00:19:18.705
This is,

479
00:19:18.705 --> 00:19:21.873
this 2012 phenomena, I think you feel

480
00:19:21.873 --> 00:19:24.081
that it's really more hype than phenomena

481
00:19:24.081 --> 00:19:26.289
and has been misinterpreted by many of the people

482
00:19:26.289 --> 00:19:28.465
that speak of 2012 right now.

483
00:19:28.465 --> 00:19:31.889
You're saying this is not apocalyptic in nature.

484
00:19:31.889 --> 00:19:34.578
We're talking about a serious shift, transition.

485
00:19:34.578 --> 00:19:35.953
Wake up call, yes.

486
00:19:35.953 --> 00:19:38.033
It's just a place to move through, though.

487
00:19:38.033 --> 00:19:39.089
<v ->That's right.</v>

488
00:19:39.089 --> 00:19:41.649
I think 2012 is to a large degree

489
00:19:41.649 --> 00:19:44.593
a disinformation campaign.

490
00:19:44.593 --> 00:19:46.834
Like a psychological operation.

491
00:19:46.834 --> 00:19:50.993
It's a test of the powers that think that be.

492
00:19:50.993 --> 00:19:54.162
How they can play with the minds of the people.

493
00:19:54.162 --> 00:19:56.017
<v Regina>To create more fear.</v>

494
00:19:56.017 --> 00:19:57.489
<v ->And to, all of it.</v>

495
00:19:57.489 --> 00:19:59.505
To create more fear, to also

496
00:19:59.505 --> 00:20:02.641
test out what kinds of thought schools

497
00:20:02.641 --> 00:20:03.889
they can implement.

498
00:20:03.889 --> 00:20:05.841
It's a large scale test.

499
00:20:05.841 --> 00:20:07.473
From there you point to some degree.

500
00:20:07.473 --> 00:20:12.305
And you will see in 2013 if time still moves on

501
00:20:12.305 --> 00:20:14.129
as time has gone so far.

502
00:20:14.129 --> 00:20:15.761
But I said, maybe time takes

503
00:20:15.761 --> 00:20:17.234
a completely different function

504
00:20:17.234 --> 00:20:21.393
and a totally different way of interrelating with it.

505
00:20:21.393 --> 00:20:23.729
But anyway, for the argument's sake,

506
00:20:23.729 --> 00:20:27.057
when we are say in middle of 2013,

507
00:20:27.057 --> 00:20:29.617
say less than three years from now.

508
00:20:29.617 --> 00:20:30.929
And we will sit together.

509
00:20:30.929 --> 00:20:33.105
I'm pretty sure we'll see that

510
00:20:33.105 --> 00:20:36.625
not much of all of these scenarios of 2012

511
00:20:36.625 --> 00:20:37.777
will have happened.

512
00:20:37.777 --> 00:20:40.945
And then maybe we'll have understood something.

513
00:20:40.945 --> 00:20:42.993
Ok, but I am saying in addition to this,

514
00:20:42.993 --> 00:20:45.233
we have to look a little longer term.

515
00:20:45.233 --> 00:20:46.737
Because I do this as an astrologist.

516
00:20:46.737 --> 00:20:50.513
So I look at the marker that is 2020, 21.

517
00:20:50.513 --> 00:20:54.289
It's actually in January of 21.

518
00:20:54.289 --> 00:20:57.105
When Saturn, Jupiter and on and on

519
00:20:57.105 --> 00:20:59.569
meet with pluto and move on to Aquarius.

520
00:20:59.569 --> 00:21:02.225
It is at that point that an economical cycle

521
00:21:02.225 --> 00:21:03.665
has ended and a new one begins.

522
00:21:03.665 --> 00:21:06.481
And it's at that point that also

523
00:21:06.481 --> 00:21:10.001
Earth's crust shifts, weather changes,

524
00:21:10.001 --> 00:21:12.433
like really important climate situations

525
00:21:12.433 --> 00:21:14.577
could take a completely new turn.

526
00:21:14.577 --> 00:21:17.073
So it's not necessarily during the next two years.

527
00:21:17.073 --> 00:21:18.449
Not that nothing is happening,

528
00:21:18.449 --> 00:21:20.721
<v Regina>It's all part of the transition period.</v>

529
00:21:20.721 --> 00:21:21.777
<v ->A development.</v>

530
00:21:21.777 --> 00:21:24.881
It's a longer term process that on the whole

531
00:21:24.881 --> 00:21:27.794
will take any way 40 to a hundred years more or less.

532
00:21:27.794 --> 00:21:29.457
I'm just looking into the next decade

533
00:21:29.457 --> 00:21:30.353
to make it simple.

534
00:21:30.353 --> 00:21:33.713
And 2020, 21 is a clear marker because of Saturn

535
00:21:33.713 --> 00:21:36.209
and Pluto together in Capricorn.

536
00:21:36.209 --> 00:21:39.569
So that's measurable and one can look back in time

537
00:21:39.569 --> 00:21:42.097
on what used to happen under similar alignments.

538
00:21:42.097 --> 00:21:43.410
There's never the same alignment

539
00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:45.938
but similar ones can be compared.

540
00:21:45.938 --> 00:21:49.585
That alignment coming in 2020 would be similar

541
00:21:49.585 --> 00:21:50.865
to say,

542
00:21:50.865 --> 00:21:54.065
when United States was formed.

543
00:21:54.065 --> 00:21:55.761
Or when industrial revolution

544
00:21:55.761 --> 00:21:57.169
and other revolution started.

545
00:21:57.169 --> 00:22:00.561
That's the kind of time revolution we look at.

546
00:22:00.561 --> 00:22:02.834
I mean, we are going to new technologies

547
00:22:02.834 --> 00:22:04.305
of the mind, mainly.

548
00:22:04.305 --> 00:22:06.641
And into new networks, et cetera.

549
00:22:06.641 --> 00:22:09.201
And also have more the interest that I follow.

550
00:22:09.201 --> 00:22:12.337
I know that Cliff is also into that.

551
00:22:12.337 --> 00:22:13.265
Many of my friends.

552
00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:15.409
That's where we are at

553
00:22:15.409 --> 00:22:18.833
in our inquiry, if you want.

554
00:22:18.833 --> 00:22:20.209
<v Regina>I find it interesting</v>

555
00:22:20.209 --> 00:22:22.897
that the 2012 scenario, the way it's

556
00:22:22.897 --> 00:22:24.881
being portrayed right now,

557
00:22:24.881 --> 00:22:28.785
is almost a direct overlay with the Christian

558
00:22:28.785 --> 00:22:32.369
Fundamentalist Apoclayptic scenarios.

559
00:22:32.369 --> 00:22:34.993
It's like one is boosting the other.

560
00:22:34.993 --> 00:22:37.265
I mean if you drive through Southern california for example

561
00:22:37.265 --> 00:22:38.481
out in the desert,

562
00:22:38.481 --> 00:22:42.129
it's predominantly Christian based radio stations.

563
00:22:42.129 --> 00:22:44.562
And for the last two or three years, you go through

564
00:22:44.562 --> 00:22:45.809
and you pick up this signal.

565
00:22:45.809 --> 00:22:47.569
And that's really interesting because

566
00:22:47.569 --> 00:22:50.833
you have the preachers talking about

567
00:22:50.833 --> 00:22:54.865
apocalyptic scenarios to their listeners.

568
00:22:54.865 --> 00:22:56.785
I mean, they're really pumping it, pumping it.

569
00:22:56.785 --> 00:22:59.537
But if you listen to 2012, it's being pumped

570
00:22:59.537 --> 00:23:00.977
exactly the same way.

571
00:23:00.977 --> 00:23:04.177
And one would have to say, if you really went

572
00:23:04.177 --> 00:23:07.089
to the roots of control,

573
00:23:07.089 --> 00:23:08.881
these are probably controlled by the,

574
00:23:08.881 --> 00:23:10.705
certain of these conceptions are controlled

575
00:23:10.705 --> 00:23:13.233
by some of the same types of entities.

576
00:23:13.233 --> 00:23:13.969
<v ->Of course.</v>

577
00:23:13.969 --> 00:23:16.881
There is at the top of this

578
00:23:16.881 --> 00:23:18.449
whatever intellectual pyramid,

579
00:23:18.449 --> 00:23:22.161
the same overmind that controls all the others.

580
00:23:22.161 --> 00:23:24.593
And they are not aware

581
00:23:24.593 --> 00:23:26.417
that they are being conditioned.

582
00:23:26.417 --> 00:23:28.721
Or rather that they have been conditioned

583
00:23:28.721 --> 00:23:32.145
for maybe hundreds or thousands of years.

584
00:23:32.145 --> 00:23:33.873
And that's where people have to really

585
00:23:33.873 --> 00:23:37.457
take time out for a moment to think about these things.

586
00:23:37.457 --> 00:23:40.209
Up to what degree are we all completely conditioned

587
00:23:40.209 --> 00:23:42.097
in our thinking?

588
00:23:42.097 --> 00:23:46.225
And yes 2012 is no different from the y2k stories.

589
00:23:46.225 --> 00:23:47.057
It's the same stuff.

590
00:23:47.057 --> 00:23:49.713
And by the way, after 2012, and this is then all over.

591
00:23:49.713 --> 00:23:53.361
In 2013, I'm sure there'll be a new school of thought

592
00:23:53.361 --> 00:23:56.722
coming with a new idea of what the solar system

593
00:23:56.722 --> 00:23:59.313
is in trouble for, et cetera.

594
00:23:59.313 --> 00:24:01.905
That's a story, by the way, that one can,

595
00:24:01.905 --> 00:24:04.561
and I've done this proof in history documented

596
00:24:04.561 --> 00:24:08.401
of about two and a half thousand years

597
00:24:08.401 --> 00:24:12.465
of written down historical documents.

598
00:24:12.465 --> 00:24:14.737
That it was only this one thing.

599
00:24:14.737 --> 00:24:17.073
It's the history of the apocalypse.

600
00:24:17.073 --> 00:24:19.153
The documentation of how mankind,

601
00:24:19.153 --> 00:24:22.161
the human mind busies itself

602
00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:25.361
discussing when the world will end.

603
00:24:25.361 --> 00:24:27.537
Seriously, there's a written history about this

604
00:24:27.537 --> 00:24:29.489
and it's a very long history.

605
00:24:29.489 --> 00:24:32.081
Now I'm not saying that 12,000 years ago

606
00:24:32.081 --> 00:24:34.673
or 26,000 years ago there may not have been

607
00:24:34.673 --> 00:24:37.297
huge apocalyptic events.

608
00:24:37.297 --> 00:24:38.033
<v Regina>Oh, yeah.</v>

609
00:24:38.033 --> 00:24:39.857
Evidence certainly suggests there were, yes.

610
00:24:39.857 --> 00:24:41.553
<v ->During the last two and a half thousand years,</v>

611
00:24:41.553 --> 00:24:45.105
mankind has been in this mode of asking itself,

612
00:24:45.105 --> 00:24:47.409
in the next hundred years, in the next 50 years,

613
00:24:47.409 --> 00:24:48.849
this and this is gonna happen.

614
00:24:48.849 --> 00:24:50.161
Think about that.

615
00:24:50.161 --> 00:24:52.945
This is ongoing trauma that sits deep

616
00:24:52.945 --> 00:24:55.217
in the genetics of mankind.

617
00:24:55.217 --> 00:24:56.529
<v Regina>Supposedly John the Baptist</v>

618
00:24:56.529 --> 00:24:57.841
used to go on about it.

619
00:24:57.841 --> 00:24:59.153
<v ->That's right. (laughing)</v>

620
00:24:59.153 --> 00:25:00.881
<v Regina>In biblical times, they were waiting</v>

621
00:25:00.881 --> 00:25:03.409
for the end of times just like the followers are

622
00:25:03.409 --> 00:25:04.273
right now.

623
00:25:04.273 --> 00:25:06.897
So if we go to,

624
00:25:06.897 --> 00:25:08.497
now a little more subtle level.

625
00:25:08.497 --> 00:25:10.961
But I think really, this is where a lot of it

626
00:25:10.961 --> 00:25:11.793
is playing out.

627
00:25:11.793 --> 00:25:14.225
We're talking about major shifts

628
00:25:14.225 --> 00:25:15.794
in magnetism.

629
00:25:15.794 --> 00:25:17.297
<v ->Yes, that's what it's about.</v>

630
00:25:17.297 --> 00:25:18.865
<v Regina>And we're talking about</v>

631
00:25:18.865 --> 00:25:21.265
also these, you can say, dimensional

632
00:25:21.265 --> 00:25:24.209
or sub-dimensional, depending on how one terms it,

633
00:25:24.209 --> 00:25:27.377
vibrational shifts in energy of the planet itself.

634
00:25:27.377 --> 00:25:29.841
And this really seems to me

635
00:25:29.841 --> 00:25:32.561
that it has to trump any and all other interference

636
00:25:32.561 --> 00:25:34.161
that could be going on.

637
00:25:34.161 --> 00:25:35.985
And any other kind of gameplan

638
00:25:35.985 --> 00:25:38.705
that we might try to lay out individually,

639
00:25:38.705 --> 00:25:39.953
magnetism is huge.

640
00:25:39.953 --> 00:25:41.201
And I noticed in your book,

641
00:25:41.201 --> 00:25:43.857
you wrote here that,

642
00:25:43.857 --> 00:25:46.513
this is I think, by Calumon,

643
00:25:46.513 --> 00:25:50.961
that October 28th 2011 is when he's expecting

644
00:25:50.961 --> 00:25:53.937
there to be a shift in magnetism.

645
00:25:53.937 --> 00:25:55.793
And let's talk about megnetism,

646
00:25:55.793 --> 00:25:57.042
we can talk about that date.

647
00:25:57.042 --> 00:25:58.129
Here's the theory.

648
00:25:58.129 --> 00:26:00.977
And why this really trumps everything else.

649
00:26:00.977 --> 00:26:02.129
<v ->Yes.</v>

650
00:26:02.129 --> 00:26:03.762
Ok, I have to say I'm not an expert

651
00:26:03.762 --> 00:26:05.842
in these scientific magnetic things.

652
00:26:05.842 --> 00:26:08.594
Although I study and I try to teach myself,

653
00:26:08.594 --> 00:26:10.737
these are all tools I'm refining.

654
00:26:10.737 --> 00:26:13.393
The way I understand it is more like

655
00:26:13.393 --> 00:26:15.052
we're going through a shift and the shift

656
00:26:15.052 --> 00:26:17.324
is going through us genetically.

657
00:26:17.324 --> 00:26:19.181
Simply said.

658
00:26:19.181 --> 00:26:21.772
What Calumon is saying, and I agree with him.

659
00:26:21.772 --> 00:26:24.332
I just look at it as a Western Astrologer.

660
00:26:24.332 --> 00:26:27.404
I can also use Eastern Astrology or line of sight,

661
00:26:27.404 --> 00:26:29.292
see the real astrology doesn't matter.

662
00:26:29.292 --> 00:26:32.205
Vedic or, it's just a measeurement of the planets

663
00:26:32.205 --> 00:26:34.636
and their alignments to each other, et cetera.

664
00:26:34.636 --> 00:26:36.684
What he is saying is that at the end of October

665
00:26:36.684 --> 00:26:41.684
of 2011, is the beginning of the end cycle.

666
00:26:43.148 --> 00:26:47.660
And that the end of 2012 is sort of the visible ending

667
00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.572
of the ending, in a very simple crude way.

668
00:26:50.572 --> 00:26:51.820
<v Regina>And when he's saying ending,</v>

669
00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.156
he's saying ending of a magnetic cycle?

670
00:26:54.156 --> 00:26:56.716
<v ->Well, what he's saying,</v>

671
00:26:56.716 --> 00:26:58.828
he's saying two very important things.

672
00:26:58.828 --> 00:27:00.780
If I can summarize him and speak for him.

673
00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.157
I don't know him, but

674
00:27:02.157 --> 00:27:04.300
he's saying,

675
00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.276
first of all, he's saying the Mayans have never said

676
00:27:07.276 --> 00:27:10.540
that 2012 or end of 2012 is the end of mankind

677
00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:12.460
or the end of a calendar also.

678
00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:13.900
Noone is saying that.

679
00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.620
<v Regina>In fact they said don't even speak about an end.</v>

680
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.284
<v ->No they don't say about ending.</v>

681
00:27:18.284 --> 00:27:21.036
On the contrary, this is when the new world tree

682
00:27:21.036 --> 00:27:22.701
or the new father begins.

683
00:27:22.701 --> 00:27:25.100
They speak of something new.

684
00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.276
And this is where I say,

685
00:27:27.276 --> 00:27:31.468
this is where the human mind is totally misguided.

686
00:27:31.468 --> 00:27:36.332
Because we're trying to understand what these sages

687
00:27:36.332 --> 00:27:38.828
tens of thousands of years ago, whatever,

688
00:27:38.828 --> 00:27:41.996
had supposedly written down.

689
00:27:41.996 --> 00:27:44.332
But they didn't really write down anything.

690
00:27:44.332 --> 00:27:47.404
They're just some stone inscription left over.

691
00:27:47.404 --> 00:27:49.292
And the other thing I say is that we cannot go

692
00:27:49.292 --> 00:27:52.300
into the unknown by a means of the known.

693
00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.132
<v Regina>Yeah as the Krista Merti.</v>

694
00:27:53.132 --> 00:27:54.796
<v ->That's it, Krsihnamurti.</v>

695
00:27:54.796 --> 00:27:57.100
So if we look at rocks and stones and inscriptions,

696
00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.636
we look at something known.

697
00:27:58.636 --> 00:28:01.196
And with that known, we're not gonna go there

698
00:28:01.196 --> 00:28:03.564
where we're supposed to go in in a fearless manner.

699
00:28:03.564 --> 00:28:05.484
And then what Calumon is also saying

700
00:28:05.484 --> 00:28:07.276
is that essentially that

701
00:28:07.276 --> 00:28:11.692
in that time zone, October November of 2011,

702
00:28:11.692 --> 00:28:13.676
so going into 2012.

703
00:28:13.676 --> 00:28:18.676
What we would notice if anything

704
00:28:18.988 --> 00:28:21.132
and here I'm paraphrasing him.

705
00:28:21.132 --> 00:28:24.492
Is that we would feel an ending of time.

706
00:28:24.492 --> 00:28:27.052
Which is another Krishnamurti way of saying things.

707
00:28:27.052 --> 00:28:31.660
In other words, we would go from mechanistic clock time

708
00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:34.284
into some sort of quantum time

709
00:28:34.284 --> 00:28:36.108
if that makes any sense.

710
00:28:36.108 --> 00:28:39.116
And I think we're seeing this happen already.

711
00:28:39.116 --> 00:28:40.556
Like these stories we were discussing

712
00:28:40.556 --> 00:28:43.916
about that an errand that is typically taking an hour

713
00:28:43.916 --> 00:28:47.244
seems by clock time to happen in twenty minutes

714
00:28:47.244 --> 00:28:48.524
or vice versa.

715
00:28:48.524 --> 00:28:49.548
Time expands.

716
00:28:49.548 --> 00:28:52.684
So these shiftings of the perception of time

717
00:28:52.684 --> 00:28:56.364
which Cliif Hye calls hyperchronism,

718
00:28:56.364 --> 00:28:57.292
they are for real.

719
00:28:57.292 --> 00:28:58.893
We can measure them, look at them.

720
00:28:58.893 --> 00:29:02.188
And so we're on our way through that gate

721
00:29:02.188 --> 00:29:05.356
of timelessness.

722
00:29:05.356 --> 00:29:07.308
I believe that that's what Calumon means.

723
00:29:07.308 --> 00:29:09.580
Was October of 2011.

724
00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:10.156
<v Regina>It would make sense</v>

725
00:29:10.156 --> 00:29:13.228
because magnetism, vibrational frequencies,

726
00:29:13.228 --> 00:29:14.508
dimensional shifts,

727
00:29:14.508 --> 00:29:17.068
that all changes time.

728
00:29:17.068 --> 00:29:20.492
It's all, puts time into a new perception.

729
00:29:20.492 --> 00:29:21.741
<v ->Yes.</v>

730
00:29:21.741 --> 00:29:24.460
And via astrology, If I can make quick bracket,

731
00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.700
when you look at Uranus now going into aries

732
00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.588
for the next seven years,

733
00:29:28.588 --> 00:29:31.948
Uranus will be constantly in a 90 degree square

734
00:29:31.948 --> 00:29:33.996
for about five years at the least

735
00:29:33.996 --> 00:29:35.660
to Pluto and Capricorn.

736
00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.189
And both these positions have a lot to do

737
00:29:38.189 --> 00:29:41.597
with the notions of timing and breaking through

738
00:29:41.597 --> 00:29:43.517
energies and magnetism, et cetera.

739
00:29:43.517 --> 00:29:46.270
Of course they have mirror effects on other things,

740
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:47.805
in worldly affairs.

741
00:29:47.805 --> 00:29:49.789
But that would be about the most important thing

742
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:53.405
is the shifting of the notions of reality.

743
00:29:53.405 --> 00:29:54.685
<v Regina>Perceptions of reality and time.</v>

744
00:29:54.685 --> 00:29:56.957
<v ->Of which time is just one part.</v>

745
00:29:56.957 --> 00:29:58.333
<v Regina>Recently I did an interview</v>

746
00:29:58.333 --> 00:30:01.213
with Jose Arguelles who takes about

747
00:30:01.213 --> 00:30:02.717
time as you know.

748
00:30:02.717 --> 00:30:05.789
And one of the things that came up in our conversation

749
00:30:05.789 --> 00:30:08.605
which will get us into this next area

750
00:30:08.605 --> 00:30:09.917
I'd like to talk about,

751
00:30:09.917 --> 00:30:12.286
is that ,

752
00:30:12.286 --> 00:30:15.357
in a nutshell, he was saying,

753
00:30:15.357 --> 00:30:18.775
that when the Gregorian calendar was introduced

754
00:30:18.775 --> 00:30:20.791
via the Sumerian times,

755
00:30:20.791 --> 00:30:23.767
this is a artificial construct of time.

756
00:30:23.767 --> 00:30:26.967
It's out of sync with natural cycles and rythms of nature

757
00:30:26.967 --> 00:30:29.783
which puts humanity in a perpetual sense

758
00:30:29.783 --> 00:30:34.564
of unease or disconnect from natural rythms of all kinds.

759
00:30:34.564 --> 00:30:35.684
<v ->Yes, that's right.</v>

760
00:30:35.684 --> 00:30:37.348
<v Regina>And he said the Mayan calendar</v>

761
00:30:37.348 --> 00:30:38.917
was introduced,

762
00:30:38.917 --> 00:30:43.844
these are both off-planet cultures he's talking about.

763
00:30:43.844 --> 00:30:47.172
One species introduced the Gregorian calendar

764
00:30:47.172 --> 00:30:48.996
to put us out of sync with ourselves.

765
00:30:48.996 --> 00:30:52.932
The others introduced through the Mayan calendar

766
00:30:52.932 --> 00:30:54.340
through the Mayans the calendar

767
00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:57.637
that would go back in harmony with natural

768
00:30:57.637 --> 00:30:59.876
cycles and rythms.

769
00:30:59.876 --> 00:31:02.756
And it would be done at a time so that right now,

770
00:31:02.756 --> 00:31:05.540
when it mattered, when time was going to change,

771
00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.068
we could reassess what time is

772
00:31:08.068 --> 00:31:10.756
and throw out the old system of time.

773
00:31:10.756 --> 00:31:15.076
Literally throw it over for a natural sense of time again.

774
00:31:15.076 --> 00:31:19.844
Natural cycles, natural rhythmic type of time again,

775
00:31:19.844 --> 00:31:21.412
much more organic.

776
00:31:21.412 --> 00:31:23.076
But the point is, he was saying,

777
00:31:23.076 --> 00:31:25.444
your'e talking about two different species

778
00:31:25.444 --> 00:31:26.820
who introduced the two different times

779
00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:28.708
which play our right now.

780
00:31:28.708 --> 00:31:32.133
The confluence of those times is now.

781
00:31:32.133 --> 00:31:34.212
So let's go into those species.

782
00:31:34.212 --> 00:31:37.700
Now your connection has been with the Nordic

783
00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.324
type beings.

784
00:31:40.324 --> 00:31:42.212
We've heard other people talk about other beings

785
00:31:42.212 --> 00:31:45.253
even with references toward a more reptilian

786
00:31:45.253 --> 00:31:48.804
kind of survivalist nature and controlling nature.

787
00:31:48.804 --> 00:31:51.940
Can you talk about the spectrum of beings

788
00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:56.197
from the origins of mankind to the best that you choose to

789
00:31:56.197 --> 00:31:57.412
or can?

790
00:31:57.412 --> 00:31:58.724
<v ->Ok, this is a huge subject.</v>

791
00:31:58.724 --> 00:31:59.556
<v Regina>I know, It's huge.</v>

792
00:31:59.556 --> 00:32:01.860
But it's one that is coming up in little bits and pieces

793
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.556
enough that it needs a better overlay.

794
00:32:03.556 --> 00:32:07.204
<v ->I think that the basis now in 2010, 11</v>

795
00:32:07.204 --> 00:32:09.860
is that those who really want to become more knowledgeable

796
00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.236
about this,

797
00:32:11.236 --> 00:32:14.532
they should look into Anton Parks.

798
00:32:14.532 --> 00:32:17.060
He's I believe a Belgian author.

799
00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.333
He writes in French and his book are so far

800
00:32:19.333 --> 00:32:21.028
not been translated in English.

801
00:32:21.028 --> 00:32:22.468
<v Regina>So let's go to the next level.</v>

802
00:32:22.468 --> 00:32:24.324
<v ->have a bit of an advantage.</v>

803
00:32:24.324 --> 00:32:26.852
Anyway, to quickly sum up his story,

804
00:32:26.852 --> 00:32:31.620
he explains in huge books this size,

805
00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.220
three books of them.

806
00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:35.748
What he feels went on

807
00:32:35.748 --> 00:32:39.300
from the night of time forward.

808
00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:40.772
And you can't sum this up.

809
00:32:40.772 --> 00:32:43.940
However, there is an author, scientist rather

810
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.540
that I have spoken about a few times,

811
00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.492
Dr. Jerry Zeitlin.

812
00:32:47.492 --> 00:32:50.596
And his website openseti.org.

813
00:32:50.596 --> 00:32:55.596
He sums up and goes into the work of Anton Parks

814
00:32:56.324 --> 00:32:58.564
so if you want to

815
00:32:58.564 --> 00:33:02.980
go into these subjects of what kinds of

816
00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:07.364
races and from what kinds of star systems they came,

817
00:33:07.364 --> 00:33:10.788
where their homeplanets or home areas

818
00:33:10.788 --> 00:33:12.676
in the cosmos was,

819
00:33:12.676 --> 00:33:14.820
that's where to find that whole discussion.

820
00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.420
<v Regina>And that was discerned through linguistics?</v>

821
00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:16.996
<v ->Say again?</v>

822
00:33:16.996 --> 00:33:18.564
<v Regina>That was discerned through linguistics?</v>

823
00:33:18.564 --> 00:33:20.260
<v ->Through linguistics, also, yes.</v>

824
00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:23.812
So Anton Parks was given, crudely summed up,

825
00:33:23.812 --> 00:33:26.820
a language that is, if I understand this correctly,

826
00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:28.644
pre- Sumerian.

827
00:33:28.644 --> 00:33:31.332
I look at these things differently, to answer your question

828
00:33:31.332 --> 00:33:34.052
in the way that, I can't answer for other races

829
00:33:34.052 --> 00:33:37.060
and I don't know in that sense, races very well.

830
00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:41.253
I have a contact or connection with what I would call

831
00:33:41.253 --> 00:33:43.972
and energy signature

832
00:33:43.972 --> 00:33:46.628
that I know is Nordic.

833
00:33:46.628 --> 00:33:48.228
And they do not,

834
00:33:48.228 --> 00:33:50.084
and I ask them all these questions.

835
00:33:50.084 --> 00:33:52.708
Constantly I did ask them when I wrote my books.

836
00:33:52.708 --> 00:33:55.844
And they've kind of trained me

837
00:33:55.844 --> 00:33:57.988
to understand what I need to know.

838
00:33:57.988 --> 00:34:00.196
After all, I have still this military background

839
00:34:00.196 --> 00:34:01.444
from a young age.

840
00:34:01.444 --> 00:34:04.100
And do you know that, we tell you what you need to know.

841
00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.140
What you have to know now, you deal with that.

842
00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:09.028
I see these other questions are interesting

843
00:34:09.028 --> 00:34:12.132
but actually irrelevant to what needs to be done now

844
00:34:12.132 --> 00:34:15.620
so I'm answering what I'm comfortable to answer

845
00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.380
in a sense of what I know.

846
00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:20.772
And if I go on and speculate about races,

847
00:34:20.772 --> 00:34:22.276
then I'm not really of much use.

848
00:34:22.276 --> 00:34:25.572
The Nordics to me are like a guidance in the sense,

849
00:34:25.572 --> 00:34:27.684
that is very practical.

850
00:34:27.684 --> 00:34:29.124
In that sense they never fail.

851
00:34:29.124 --> 00:34:30.500
It's only I who can fail myself.

852
00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.604
If they say, we suggest you look at this

853
00:34:33.604 --> 00:34:35.716
or read that.

854
00:34:35.716 --> 00:34:38.468
They try to teach me to teach myself.

855
00:34:38.468 --> 00:34:39.973
They're not telling me what to do.

856
00:34:39.973 --> 00:34:43.364
This is why I know they're proper guides.

857
00:34:43.364 --> 00:34:46.340
See and that's how I try to talk to people.

858
00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:49.444
To make them figure it out themselves.

859
00:34:49.444 --> 00:34:52.772
That's the only way you become of use to yourself.

860
00:34:52.772 --> 00:34:57.348
Because otherwise, we again in this beggar position

861
00:34:57.348 --> 00:35:00.228
where we ask an altar authority

862
00:35:00.228 --> 00:35:02.020
to tell us what to do, and that's wrong.

863
00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:04.933
That's fundamentally, exactly not what we want to do.

864
00:35:04.933 --> 00:35:07.588
And this is how you, to answer the question inherent,

865
00:35:07.588 --> 00:35:12.292
this is how you know if this is a positive beneficial

866
00:35:12.292 --> 00:35:14.916
or not so good contact.

867
00:35:14.916 --> 00:35:15.780
That's the criteria.

868
00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:16.836
<v Regina>Well the reason I'm sitting here</v>

869
00:35:16.836 --> 00:35:19.428
just kind of laughing inside, chuckling inside

870
00:35:19.428 --> 00:35:21.284
is because the beings that I speak to

871
00:35:21.284 --> 00:35:23.076
tell me the same thing.

872
00:35:23.076 --> 00:35:25.284
This is not practical, we don't need to tell you this

873
00:35:25.284 --> 00:35:27.044
at this time because it's not practical

874
00:35:27.044 --> 00:35:28.996
to what you're working on and what you're learning

875
00:35:28.996 --> 00:35:30.116
and what you're doing.

876
00:35:30.116 --> 00:35:32.772
And so I'm always curious because

877
00:35:32.772 --> 00:35:33.892
it's the same thing.

878
00:35:33.892 --> 00:35:36.228
I can ascertain a certain amount by myself.

879
00:35:36.228 --> 00:35:37.668
<v ->Yes, and it's also hugely complex.</v>

880
00:35:37.668 --> 00:35:39.300
<v Regina>It's hugely complex.</v>

881
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.572
<v ->Millions of human years or whatever back.</v>

882
00:35:41.572 --> 00:35:43.077
<v Regina>Billions, perhaps.</v>

883
00:35:43.077 --> 00:35:44.228
Billions of years.

884
00:35:44.228 --> 00:35:46.020
So I thought, well I'll cheat.

885
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:49.412
I'll see if you know them (laughing)

886
00:35:49.412 --> 00:35:51.236
We'll use your guides or Cliff guides,

887
00:35:51.236 --> 00:35:53.156
Cliff's guides or someone to complete this.

888
00:35:53.156 --> 00:35:56.485
But I think that's probably wise

889
00:35:56.485 --> 00:36:00.401
to direct people to Jerry Zeitlin.

890
00:36:00.401 --> 00:36:01.521
<v ->Jerry Zeitlin.</v>

891
00:36:01.521 --> 00:36:04.402
Z-e-I-t-l-I-n.

892
00:36:04.402 --> 00:36:05.329
<v Regina>Ok.</v>

893
00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:07.185
And the reason I brought it up

894
00:36:07.185 --> 00:36:10.161
is because now there are many different authors

895
00:36:10.161 --> 00:36:12.849
and people doing archaeological research

896
00:36:12.849 --> 00:36:15.953
that are beginning to talk about the genetically

897
00:36:15.953 --> 00:36:17.937
engineered origins of mankind.

898
00:36:17.937 --> 00:36:20.306
And there are people that are starting to

899
00:36:20.306 --> 00:36:22.385
really become aware of this knowledge.

900
00:36:22.385 --> 00:36:25.073
But it's just being tossed out in little crumbs

901
00:36:25.073 --> 00:36:26.225
and bits and pieces.

902
00:36:26.225 --> 00:36:27.857
And yes it's up to everybody to have to go

903
00:36:27.857 --> 00:36:28.625
on that journey.

904
00:36:28.625 --> 00:36:30.513
Figure as much out as you can for yourself.

905
00:36:30.513 --> 00:36:33.553
But I suppose for expediency's sake,

906
00:36:33.553 --> 00:36:36.049
it's nice if there is,

907
00:36:36.049 --> 00:36:38.193
a couple, two or three overarching stories

908
00:36:38.193 --> 00:36:40.081
to start tying this together before anyone

909
00:36:40.081 --> 00:36:42.546
follows the breadcrumbs down a road

910
00:36:42.546 --> 00:36:45.553
that really is non-productive or frightening.

911
00:36:45.553 --> 00:36:48.721
<v ->It's also in my sense of,</v>

912
00:36:48.721 --> 00:36:50.097
you know, I'm sort of a time expert,

913
00:36:50.097 --> 00:36:51.857
for lack of a better word.

914
00:36:51.857 --> 00:36:53.393
I don't like to go back in time,

915
00:36:53.393 --> 00:36:55.057
to make it blunt quickly.

916
00:36:55.057 --> 00:36:58.033
I don't think that by going into the past,

917
00:36:58.033 --> 00:37:00.049
we'll understand our future.

918
00:37:00.049 --> 00:37:03.569
In a very blunt way, to say this bluntly.

919
00:37:03.569 --> 00:37:05.745
I think we're going to figure this out

920
00:37:05.745 --> 00:37:07.057
by going forward.

921
00:37:07.057 --> 00:37:08.978
I'm not saying we shouldn't know what was in the past.

922
00:37:08.978 --> 00:37:10.129
That's not what I'm trying to say.

923
00:37:10.129 --> 00:37:15.129
But I know we don't have so much clock time left

924
00:37:15.857 --> 00:37:18.897
to get a very serious grip on how we have to be ready now

925
00:37:18.897 --> 00:37:19.793
for what's coming.

926
00:37:19.793 --> 00:37:21.905
And there's some really good stuff coming.

927
00:37:21.905 --> 00:37:23.761
<v Regina>Let's talk about the good stuff.</v>

928
00:37:23.761 --> 00:37:26.033
And also talk about resources and how to

929
00:37:26.033 --> 00:37:29.265
reevaluate what is of value anymore.

930
00:37:29.265 --> 00:37:30.482
Because that system's,

931
00:37:30.482 --> 00:37:31.825
that's changing very rapidly.

932
00:37:31.825 --> 00:37:32.689
<v ->That's well said.</v>

933
00:37:32.689 --> 00:37:34.225
That's what we have to figure out,

934
00:37:34.225 --> 00:37:36.081
is what is now really of value or not.

935
00:37:36.081 --> 00:37:37.489
And that's what gold shows us

936
00:37:37.489 --> 00:37:40.049
or what the whole turning upside down

937
00:37:40.049 --> 00:37:43.218
of the economic cycles is showing us in the next ten years.

938
00:37:43.218 --> 00:37:47.601
I feel that what is of value is going to be relationships,

939
00:37:47.601 --> 00:37:49.202
networks,

940
00:37:49.202 --> 00:37:53.489
and the ability together to create a whole new existence.

941
00:37:53.489 --> 00:37:54.961
I call this adjust an existence.

942
00:37:54.961 --> 00:37:57.137
A new reality.

943
00:37:57.137 --> 00:38:01.521
And there are no rules to this or no criteria

944
00:38:01.521 --> 00:38:04.273
other than to be productive.

945
00:38:04.273 --> 00:38:05.937
What's coming towards us are going to be

946
00:38:05.937 --> 00:38:08.849
new technologies, of the mind primarily.

947
00:38:08.849 --> 00:38:10.225
We are the new technology.

948
00:38:10.225 --> 00:38:12.785
Or our mind is at the best of levels.

949
00:38:12.785 --> 00:38:17.393
Which means time travel, which means

950
00:38:17.393 --> 00:38:20.209
so many thing, new healing methods.

951
00:38:20.209 --> 00:38:22.161
Of course new energies, new mathematics,

952
00:38:22.161 --> 00:38:23.793
new sciences, all that stuff

953
00:38:23.793 --> 00:38:27.441
is actually within us, it exists.

954
00:38:27.441 --> 00:38:29.937
And we have to tap into this, open this up.

955
00:38:29.937 --> 00:38:31.409
And with this we're going to create

956
00:38:31.409 --> 00:38:33.457
the real new future.

957
00:38:33.457 --> 00:38:35.825
New cities, new everything.

958
00:38:35.825 --> 00:38:36.945
That's what this is about now.

959
00:38:36.945 --> 00:38:39.793
So what this is about is that we

960
00:38:39.793 --> 00:38:43.729
in our self, in our own inner self, the mind,

961
00:38:43.729 --> 00:38:46.161
the viewing, the visions, whatever we can muster,

962
00:38:46.161 --> 00:38:48.017
go into our new technologies.

963
00:38:48.017 --> 00:38:50.385
Because our mind is the new technology.

964
00:38:50.385 --> 00:38:54.865
In that field, we are going to find new medicine,

965
00:38:54.865 --> 00:38:57.489
new healing methods, new energies of course,

966
00:38:57.489 --> 00:39:00.081
new mathematics, new physics, all these great things

967
00:39:00.081 --> 00:39:03.089
with which, those are old tools by the way like a pen.

968
00:39:03.089 --> 00:39:04.050
Those are only tools.

969
00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:08.209
With those we will create the new future on this planet

970
00:39:08.209 --> 00:39:12.561
which is self-sustained, self-organized, self-responsible,

971
00:39:12.561 --> 00:39:15.249
new architecture, new cities will come up.

972
00:39:15.249 --> 00:39:17.617
Like the guy who does the Venus projects

973
00:39:17.617 --> 00:39:18.769
These kinds of things.

974
00:39:18.769 --> 00:39:21.393
It's very important to make a quick bracket

975
00:39:21.393 --> 00:39:23.313
that I say when we go through these times

976
00:39:23.313 --> 00:39:26.193
that may sound survivalist which I don't like at all.

977
00:39:26.193 --> 00:39:29.169
I'm not going backwards and live like the stone age.

978
00:39:29.169 --> 00:39:32.209
I want to look forward and live in the really good times

979
00:39:32.209 --> 00:39:34.865
where we have magnetic levitation.

980
00:39:34.865 --> 00:39:37.521
Where we actually no longer have to travel

981
00:39:37.521 --> 00:39:39.377
by planes or cars.

982
00:39:39.377 --> 00:39:41.297
Where we travel by time travel.

983
00:39:41.297 --> 00:39:42.897
Where everything is telepathic.

984
00:39:42.897 --> 00:39:44.721
Where we live like the Nordics do.

985
00:39:44.721 --> 00:39:48.625
Where we may even perhaps no longer need our form

986
00:39:48.625 --> 00:39:50.513
in the sense that we can astral travel.

987
00:39:50.513 --> 00:39:54.673
We can do a hundred million other things

988
00:39:54.673 --> 00:39:57.393
that we can at the moment just dream of

989
00:39:57.393 --> 00:39:58.801
like it was science fiction.

990
00:39:58.801 --> 00:39:59.633
But it is real.

991
00:39:59.633 --> 00:40:01.809
And that's what I'm talking about.

992
00:40:01.809 --> 00:40:03.953
And that's what the next ten years of preparations

993
00:40:03.953 --> 00:40:05.233
are about.

994
00:40:05.233 --> 00:40:09.009
And within about maybe 50 to 80 years,

995
00:40:09.009 --> 00:40:11.858
we'll check of the list of this checklist.

996
00:40:11.858 --> 00:40:15.409
A few good markers where we get to a new

997
00:40:15.409 --> 00:40:16.497
positive world.

998
00:40:16.497 --> 00:40:18.417
<v Regina>That's what James Wingmaker I believe</v>

999
00:40:18.417 --> 00:40:22.226
has that portal for the shifting of consciousness

1000
00:40:22.226 --> 00:40:24.177
about 70 years out also.

1001
00:40:24.177 --> 00:40:25.297
<v ->That's right.</v>

1002
00:40:25.297 --> 00:40:27.377
He has that too, James speaks of

1003
00:40:27.377 --> 00:40:28.689
about that timeframe.

1004
00:40:28.689 --> 00:40:31.537
Cliff sees in much further out reports

1005
00:40:31.537 --> 00:40:33.425
via linguistics.

1006
00:40:33.425 --> 00:40:38.097
80 to 84 years which is exaclty one Uranus cycle.

1007
00:40:38.097 --> 00:40:39.121
<v Regina>Mhmm, Uranus cycle.</v>

1008
00:40:39.121 --> 00:40:40.465
<v ->Yes, Uranus cycle.</v>

1009
00:40:40.465 --> 00:40:42.801
Now in Aries, which is really the new beginning

1010
00:40:42.801 --> 00:40:46.001
of the new beginning, right now in 2010, 11

1011
00:40:46.001 --> 00:40:49.585
would bring us, 84 years later

1012
00:40:49.585 --> 00:40:50.897
back into Aries.

1013
00:40:50.897 --> 00:40:53.265
<v Regina>At the next level of the beginning.</v>

1014
00:40:53.265 --> 00:40:55.761
<v ->At the next level of the next beginning.</v>

1015
00:40:55.761 --> 00:40:58.289
And so these are actually positive stories

1016
00:40:58.289 --> 00:41:00.177
that begin in ourselves.

1017
00:41:00.177 --> 00:41:03.345
And they only are going to happen for real

1018
00:41:03.345 --> 00:41:07.633
when we have this complete mutation of the mind

1019
00:41:07.633 --> 00:41:10.609
happening which is this big subject that Krishnamurti

1020
00:41:10.609 --> 00:41:12.882
spent his whole life teaching about.

1021
00:41:12.882 --> 00:41:14.321
That's where we have to go into.

1022
00:41:14.321 --> 00:41:16.561
And that's why the job begins in ourselves.

1023
00:41:16.561 --> 00:41:19.825
And that's why I say it's not a matter of looking outside

1024
00:41:19.825 --> 00:41:21.553
for authority solutions.

1025
00:41:21.553 --> 00:41:23.665
We have to go inside.

1026
00:41:23.665 --> 00:41:25.745
<v Regina>And it's beginning to show itself already</v>

1027
00:41:25.745 --> 00:41:27.473
even the last two to three decades where

1028
00:41:27.473 --> 00:41:30.098
people are beginning to understand things as simple,

1029
00:41:30.098 --> 00:41:32.593
because a lot of it just starts right at home in the body,

1030
00:41:32.593 --> 00:41:35.761
energy technologies for healing each other,

1031
00:41:35.761 --> 00:41:36.881
for healing the self.

1032
00:41:36.881 --> 00:41:39.601
Which was really, very new.

1033
00:41:39.601 --> 00:41:41.713
It was reintroduced into mankind.

1034
00:41:41.713 --> 00:41:46.417
But it's a glimpse of what we'll be doing in the future.

1035
00:41:46.417 --> 00:41:49.074
Just a glimpse of what we'll all be doing in the future.

1036
00:41:49.074 --> 00:41:51.473
Just see that one can use the mind for healing.

1037
00:41:51.473 --> 00:41:52.978
Something as simple as healing.

1038
00:41:52.978 --> 00:41:54.577
But let's extend it beyond that.

1039
00:41:54.577 --> 00:41:56.753
As you said, you're talking about time travel.

1040
00:41:56.753 --> 00:41:58.449
Which many people can do now,

1041
00:41:58.449 --> 00:42:00.465
it's called remote viewing.

1042
00:42:00.465 --> 00:42:03.711
Remote viewing is time travel.

1043
00:42:03.711 --> 00:42:06.303
You sit home, and you go forward, you go backwards

1044
00:42:06.303 --> 00:42:07.807
and other places.

1045
00:42:07.807 --> 00:42:10.431
And so, that's already beginning and showing itself.

1046
00:42:10.431 --> 00:42:13.567
What are some of the other technologies,

1047
00:42:13.567 --> 00:42:15.455
mind technologies that you're seeing beginning

1048
00:42:15.455 --> 00:42:16.799
to show themselves already?

1049
00:42:16.799 --> 00:42:19.263
So we can all look to that as our future.

1050
00:42:19.263 --> 00:42:21.471
<v ->Ok, the one thing I'm personally interested in</v>

1051
00:42:21.471 --> 00:42:23.999
because I'm a little bit in the business of communication

1052
00:42:23.999 --> 00:42:24.671
as well,

1053
00:42:24.671 --> 00:42:27.327
is that we will be able, via telepathy

1054
00:42:27.327 --> 00:42:29.599
and possibly via crystal slates

1055
00:42:29.599 --> 00:42:31.871
or instruments based on crystal

1056
00:42:31.871 --> 00:42:35.103
because we are crystals inside at the pineal gland level.

1057
00:42:35.103 --> 00:42:38.399
Crystals all around in cosmos.

1058
00:42:38.399 --> 00:42:42.239
We'll be able to use an instrument

1059
00:42:42.239 --> 00:42:46.175
where we no longer have to type and be slow.

1060
00:42:46.175 --> 00:42:48.799
Slow down like we are now with computers.

1061
00:42:48.799 --> 00:42:52.031
Or where maybe cameras or watches.

1062
00:42:52.031 --> 00:42:56.927
Just simple tools will be built with new materials

1063
00:42:56.927 --> 00:43:00.319
that are all based on telepathy

1064
00:43:00.319 --> 00:43:01.407
if that makes any sense.

1065
00:43:01.407 --> 00:43:01.939
<v Regina>It makes total sense.</v>

1066
00:43:01.939 --> 00:43:02.659
<v ->I don't know how to do.</v>

1067
00:43:02.659 --> 00:43:04.102
Otherwise I would invent it and show.

1068
00:43:04.102 --> 00:43:06.628
I have however beginnings of designs

1069
00:43:06.628 --> 00:43:10.149
that are sometimes given to me

1070
00:43:10.149 --> 00:43:11.715
in what people call dreams.

1071
00:43:11.715 --> 00:43:12.867
But they aren't real dreams.

1072
00:43:12.867 --> 00:43:15.171
I know that they take me someplace.

1073
00:43:15.171 --> 00:43:16.611
And it sometimes show me stuff.

1074
00:43:16.611 --> 00:43:18.787
When I want.

1075
00:43:18.787 --> 00:43:21.827
It's at that practical level that I'm interested in.

1076
00:43:21.827 --> 00:43:24.387
You see when I ask them for instance about politics

1077
00:43:24.387 --> 00:43:26.115
or economy, they kind of stop.

1078
00:43:26.115 --> 00:43:27.651
Well, they just go silent

1079
00:43:27.651 --> 00:43:31.971
until I figure out that's not the correct question.

1080
00:43:31.971 --> 00:43:33.859
I'm supposed to ask the impossible questions.

1081
00:43:33.859 --> 00:43:36.259
So I ask what these things that you're asking me now.

1082
00:43:36.259 --> 00:43:37.603
And that's interesting.

1083
00:43:37.603 --> 00:43:41.763
I'm being shown new communication technologies to answer it.

1084
00:43:41.763 --> 00:43:45.955
New means, tools, crystals,

1085
00:43:45.955 --> 00:43:48.995
materials and also new ways of thinking

1086
00:43:48.995 --> 00:43:51.331
these communications into being.

1087
00:43:51.331 --> 00:43:53.636
And eventually we'll do this just telepathically

1088
00:43:53.636 --> 00:43:54.915
with each other.

1089
00:43:54.915 --> 00:43:56.803
And then, when we can do that,

1090
00:43:56.803 --> 00:43:59.619
we'll also be doing it among other races.

1091
00:43:59.619 --> 00:44:02.179
And among much bigger space.

1092
00:44:02.179 --> 00:44:04.035
That's when it gets really interesting.

1093
00:44:04.035 --> 00:44:04.899
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1094
00:44:04.899 --> 00:44:08.131
Very recently in Vancouver, a few months ago,

1095
00:44:08.131 --> 00:44:09.379
two or three months ago.

1096
00:44:09.379 --> 00:44:11.683
I was at a conference, Barbara Marx-Hubbard

1097
00:44:11.683 --> 00:44:13.443
and many other people, Andrew Harvey,

1098
00:44:13.443 --> 00:44:15.844
people we have on the site were speaking

1099
00:44:15.844 --> 00:44:17.763
and we were taken by another person

1100
00:44:17.763 --> 00:44:21.667
into a meditation into the future.

1101
00:44:21.667 --> 00:44:23.651
And everybody was left to just see it.

1102
00:44:23.651 --> 00:44:25.699
And that's exactly where I found myself.

1103
00:44:25.699 --> 00:44:28.259
I was in a dome shaped building that could be moved.

1104
00:44:28.259 --> 00:44:29.316
Dome.

1105
00:44:29.316 --> 00:44:34.115
And I was sitting in front of a computer screen.

1106
00:44:34.115 --> 00:44:35.939
And on the computer screen,

1107
00:44:35.939 --> 00:44:38.883
I had telepathically sent a message to a friend

1108
00:44:38.883 --> 00:44:40.675
on the other side of the planet.

1109
00:44:40.675 --> 00:44:43.875
And that friend popped up on the computer screen.

1110
00:44:43.875 --> 00:44:46.051
Everything was telepathically linked.

1111
00:44:46.051 --> 00:44:49.315
And also the other thing that I saw in that

1112
00:44:49.315 --> 00:44:52.515
was there were beings from other off-planet cultures

1113
00:44:52.515 --> 00:44:55.299
working peacefully alongside human beings.

1114
00:44:55.299 --> 00:44:56.355
<v ->That's right.</v>

1115
00:44:56.355 --> 00:44:58.563
<v Rgeina>But they were not afraid to be here.</v>

1116
00:44:58.563 --> 00:45:00.131
I mean they were here physically.

1117
00:45:00.131 --> 00:45:01.539
But it was very peaceful.

1118
00:45:01.539 --> 00:45:05.219
All technologies were done in cooperation.

1119
00:45:05.219 --> 00:45:07.939
There were no more boundaries or borders between countries

1120
00:45:07.939 --> 00:45:11.363
because the ease of levitational travel was just poof,

1121
00:45:11.363 --> 00:45:13.284
you could be where you needed to be so quickly.

1122
00:45:13.284 --> 00:45:15.075
It was just what you were talking about.

1123
00:45:15.075 --> 00:45:17.700
<v ->Where you no longer need the problematic issues</v>

1124
00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:20.035
of translating the words and stuff like that.

1125
00:45:20.035 --> 00:45:22.083
<v Regina>It was so smooth and beautiful.</v>

1126
00:45:22.083 --> 00:45:23.555
<v ->You may see this still.</v>

1127
00:45:23.555 --> 00:45:24.387
<v Regina>In our lifetime?</v>

1128
00:45:24.387 --> 00:45:25.187
<v ->I think so, yes.</v>

1129
00:45:25.187 --> 00:45:26.595
I want to see this.

1130
00:45:26.595 --> 00:45:28.227
<v Regina>I would love to see that in our lifetime.</v>

1131
00:45:28.227 --> 00:45:29.764
<v ->I'm sure this is being worked on.</v>

1132
00:45:29.764 --> 00:45:31.139
And you're quite right when you say

1133
00:45:31.139 --> 00:45:33.539
that some beings can take form if they have to

1134
00:45:33.539 --> 00:45:34.659
for a moment.

1135
00:45:34.659 --> 00:45:35.555
And they are around us,

1136
00:45:35.555 --> 00:45:36.963
<v Regina>Oh yeah, they're here all the time.</v>

1137
00:45:36.963 --> 00:45:40.067
<v ->This is at some level going on.</v>

1138
00:45:40.067 --> 00:45:41.891
<v Regina>But this is, in the future, open.</v>

1139
00:45:41.891 --> 00:45:44.035
It was open, there was no more of that.

1140
00:45:44.035 --> 00:45:45.731
We were communicating between species.

1141
00:45:45.731 --> 00:45:47.971
We are all working cosmically and consciously

1142
00:45:47.971 --> 00:45:48.771
together.

1143
00:45:48.771 --> 00:45:50.660
It was really quite a lovely scene.

1144
00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:53.091
And in addition, the dome was movable.

1145
00:45:53.091 --> 00:45:55.363
And I had placed it in a place of the world

1146
00:45:55.363 --> 00:45:57.283
that had the exact herbs and nutrients

1147
00:45:57.283 --> 00:45:59.395
my being needed at that moment.

1148
00:45:59.395 --> 00:46:01.091
But it could change and you could move

1149
00:46:01.091 --> 00:46:01.859
to another place.

1150
00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:02.884
<v ->That's right.</v>

1151
00:46:02.884 --> 00:46:05.699
That's the other issue I'm more into

1152
00:46:05.699 --> 00:46:08.355
which one could call healing

1153
00:46:08.355 --> 00:46:11.299
or not medicine, it's not a good word to use.

1154
00:46:11.299 --> 00:46:16.196
I'm not allowed to advise people practicing health much

1155
00:46:16.196 --> 00:46:19.043
but I know that for myself I was able

1156
00:46:19.043 --> 00:46:21.667
to teach myself what kinds of plants you need.

1157
00:46:21.667 --> 00:46:23.651
<v Regina>So this is really important, right now,</v>

1158
00:46:23.651 --> 00:46:24.323
to learn this?

1159
00:46:24.323 --> 00:46:26.467
<v ->Right now this is something people should look into.</v>

1160
00:46:26.467 --> 00:46:29.987
I think everyone should be their own doctor.

1161
00:46:29.987 --> 00:46:31.011
Essentially.

1162
00:46:31.011 --> 00:46:33.795
Everyone should have at least rudimentary level

1163
00:46:33.795 --> 00:46:35.363
of knowing about plants.

1164
00:46:35.363 --> 00:46:37.700
And I have to say that not everything works

1165
00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:38.532
for everybody.

1166
00:46:38.532 --> 00:46:41.251
That's why each one need to try out for himself or herself

1167
00:46:41.251 --> 00:46:46.251
what kinds of plants you use to take care of

1168
00:46:46.659 --> 00:46:48.579
whatever you need to be taken care of.

1169
00:46:48.579 --> 00:46:50.499
And you're right that these plants may change

1170
00:46:50.499 --> 00:46:52.355
maybe shifted over time.

1171
00:46:52.355 --> 00:46:54.275
And that it has to be mobile, everything

1172
00:46:54.275 --> 00:46:56.995
so we can take it with us, et cetera.

1173
00:46:56.995 --> 00:46:59.524
That's another whole field of what I would call

1174
00:46:59.524 --> 00:47:00.355
technology.

1175
00:47:00.355 --> 00:47:03.555
The healing via plants and also the nutrition.

1176
00:47:03.555 --> 00:47:06.819
Like for instance if things get really bad for a moment.

1177
00:47:06.819 --> 00:47:09.411
If like, climactic change has happened

1178
00:47:09.411 --> 00:47:12.195
that make it impossible for a while to eat normally.

1179
00:47:12.195 --> 00:47:14.659
Then for instance, I know for myself,

1180
00:47:14.659 --> 00:47:16.867
I don't know with others but I know that wheatgrass

1181
00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:18.339
does the job.

1182
00:47:18.339 --> 00:47:20.579
Those are little things.

1183
00:47:20.579 --> 00:47:23.363
My book is full of these little checklist things

1184
00:47:23.363 --> 00:47:26.563
but that's typically now what I would call

1185
00:47:26.563 --> 00:47:29.763
the byproduct of Nordic education.

1186
00:47:29.763 --> 00:47:30.883
That's simple stuff.

1187
00:47:30.883 --> 00:47:32.291
<v Regina>It's simple stuff but that's where we need</v>

1188
00:47:32.291 --> 00:47:33.475
to begin.
<v ->Everybody needs to learn.</v>

1189
00:47:33.475 --> 00:47:34.211
<v Regina>Yeah, absolutely.</v>

1190
00:47:34.211 --> 00:47:36.419
That's a beginning place for all of us.

1191
00:47:36.419 --> 00:47:38.467
To start looking at the practical list of resources

1192
00:47:38.467 --> 00:47:39.683
as you say.

1193
00:47:39.683 --> 00:47:42.275
Checking off the list of things we need to consider

1194
00:47:42.275 --> 00:47:45.123
to move through this time in a way

1195
00:47:45.123 --> 00:47:47.171
in which we don't have to panic.

1196
00:47:47.171 --> 00:47:49.635
And which we can still have the ease to open the mind

1197
00:47:49.635 --> 00:47:51.075
unto new areas.

1198
00:47:51.075 --> 00:47:53.603
<v ->That's the point, not to be panicky, like you said.</v>

1199
00:47:53.603 --> 00:47:54.755
They will come.

1200
00:47:54.755 --> 00:47:57.091
That's what I meant about this internal preparation.

1201
00:47:57.091 --> 00:48:00.420
Which is the refining, but which is also a lot of learning.

1202
00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:03.843
There has to go, energy has to go into

1203
00:48:03.843 --> 00:48:06.531
learning a lot of stuff that we have not been taught.

1204
00:48:06.531 --> 00:48:09.731
And we have a bit more time to learn all this.

1205
00:48:09.731 --> 00:48:11.331
And some of it we will need.

1206
00:48:11.331 --> 00:48:12.899
So I have to repeat.

1207
00:48:12.899 --> 00:48:14.980
Maybe uncomfortable for a moment,

1208
00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:16.387
for about 10 years.

1209
00:48:16.387 --> 00:48:21.380
You know this whole planetary realm is changing over

1210
00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:24.451
a 50, 80 to 120 year time.

1211
00:48:24.451 --> 00:48:27.587
It's a long passage of changes, of transformations.

1212
00:48:27.587 --> 00:48:31.203
Most people think in these short timespans

1213
00:48:31.203 --> 00:48:32.867
and that's just not the way it works.

1214
00:48:32.867 --> 00:48:34.403
So you have to be

1215
00:48:34.403 --> 00:48:36.483
in the knowledge knowing that you'll be patient

1216
00:48:36.483 --> 00:48:39.684
and go through this but positively.

1217
00:48:39.684 --> 00:48:40.579
<v Regina>Any final thoughts,</v>

1218
00:48:40.579 --> 00:48:42.499
because we're, I know we're just about out of time

1219
00:48:42.499 --> 00:48:44.483
and the church bell's going to ring in just a moment.

1220
00:48:44.483 --> 00:48:46.339
(laughing)

1221
00:48:46.339 --> 00:48:48.931
<v ->The time marker.</v>

1222
00:48:48.931 --> 00:48:52.803
Well, I feel what's important is that

1223
00:48:52.803 --> 00:48:56.163
you watch this in tune with yourself

1224
00:48:56.163 --> 00:48:59.203
and begin to network.

1225
00:48:59.203 --> 00:49:02.787
Locally, in walking distance to begin with.

1226
00:49:02.787 --> 00:49:04.739
And then because you may not have a car.

1227
00:49:04.739 --> 00:49:07.395
You may not be able to move far for a while.

1228
00:49:07.395 --> 00:49:09.507
But maybe everything will be ok.

1229
00:49:09.507 --> 00:49:11.587
You have to think defensively first

1230
00:49:11.587 --> 00:49:13.283
and from there, network.

1231
00:49:13.283 --> 00:49:15.747
And then continue to network globally,

1232
00:49:15.747 --> 00:49:17.059
internatioinally.

1233
00:49:17.059 --> 00:49:19.843
I do not feel that the internet is going down.

1234
00:49:19.843 --> 00:49:21.795
To answer that non asked question,

1235
00:49:21.795 --> 00:49:23.715
I believe that things will still be ok.

1236
00:49:23.715 --> 00:49:25.411
Or if things go very bad,

1237
00:49:25.411 --> 00:49:27.939
we'll immediately have another technology coming up

1238
00:49:27.939 --> 00:49:29.603
that's probably ready.

1239
00:49:29.603 --> 00:49:32.708
And I feel

1240
00:49:32.708 --> 00:49:35.331
on the most practical level, you must be able to create

1241
00:49:35.331 --> 00:49:36.707
your own economy.

1242
00:49:36.707 --> 00:49:38.691
In other words, whatever your skills are,

1243
00:49:38.691 --> 00:49:41.347
whatever your knowledge is, practice that.

1244
00:49:41.347 --> 00:49:44.355
Refine it and become the best at what you are,

1245
00:49:44.355 --> 00:49:46.531
be the best at what you're doing

1246
00:49:46.531 --> 00:49:51.363
and create networks that can

1247
00:49:51.363 --> 00:49:53.219
create an economy that you are ok,

1248
00:49:53.219 --> 00:49:56.419
that you can do well and that you can thrive.

1249
00:49:56.419 --> 00:49:57.635
And not for surviving.

1250
00:49:57.635 --> 00:49:58.723
It's not about surviving.

1251
00:49:58.723 --> 00:50:00.451
<v Regina>Social credit, I think it's called in some places</v>

1252
00:50:00.451 --> 00:50:01.219
in England.

1253
00:50:01.219 --> 00:50:01.923
<v ->That's a good word.</v>

1254
00:50:01.923 --> 00:50:04.163
<v Regina>That's wonderful.</v>

1255
00:50:04.163 --> 00:50:04.963
Very good.

1256
00:50:04.963 --> 00:50:06.563
Well, Michael, I'm so glad we had a chance

1257
00:50:06.563 --> 00:50:07.811
to finally get together.

1258
00:50:07.811 --> 00:50:08.611
<v ->You too, thank you very much.</v>

1259
00:50:08.611 --> 00:50:09.923
<v Regina>And thank you very much for your time</v>

1260
00:50:09.923 --> 00:50:12.035
and for driving, well five hours to see us.

1261
00:50:12.035 --> 00:50:13.091
<v ->That's ok.</v>

1262
00:50:13.091 --> 00:50:15.395
(laughing) That was fun.

1263
00:50:15.395 --> 00:50:17.533
Thank you very much.

1264
00:50:19.107 --> 00:50:21.155
<v ->Michael has written a synopsis of what lies ahead</v>

1265
00:50:21.155 --> 00:50:24.547
in a very succinct little book called "The St.Clair Brief"

1266
00:50:24.547 --> 00:50:26.019
which I reccomend reading.

1267
00:50:26.019 --> 00:50:29.251
It's realistic, broad-reaching and practical

1268
00:50:29.251 --> 00:50:31.043
as a guide to the near future.

1269
00:50:31.043 --> 00:50:34.494
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
