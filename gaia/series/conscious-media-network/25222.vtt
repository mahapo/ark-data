00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:08.189
<v ->Who among you does not remember or understand</v>

2
00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.009
your dreams, but would like to?

3
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:11.269
If you said, "I would,"

4
00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.029
you're going to love this interview.

5
00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:14.609
Robert Moss has spent a lifetime

6
00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:18.049
researching, experiencing, and teaching about dream time.

7
00:00:18.049 --> 00:00:20.509
One of his most popular books, Dream Gates,

8
00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:22.309
gives detailed information about the nature

9
00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:23.949
of our night time dreams,

10
00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.109
while his newest book, Active Dreaming:

11
00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.809
Journeying Beyond Limitation to a Life of Wild Freedom,

12
00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:32.369
speaks to both dreaming and daydreaming,

13
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.989
or active dreaming.

14
00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.689
In our interview we spoke of both,

15
00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:37.649
as he shared profound wisdoms regarding

16
00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.939
our internal dreamscape.

17
00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:42.229
Robert, I noticed in your book,

18
00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:45.349
one of the things you said fairly early on

19
00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:49.219
was that you don't really like the term lucid dreaming.

20
00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.909
And there's a reason for it and you have a prefered way

21
00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:54.750
of speaking of dreamtime.

22
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.829
<v ->Well for a while lucid dreaming was discussed</v>

23
00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.329
in American culture as if it's essentially about

24
00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.429
waking up to the fact that you're dreaming

25
00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.089
during a sleep dream.

26
00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.209
And then taking control and trying to manipulate

27
00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.889
the content of the dream.

28
00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:10.169
Well, first of all, you know we can become lucid dreamers

29
00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:11.729
while wide awake and conscious.

30
00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.929
We don't have to do it only during sleep dreams.

31
00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:16.369
We can learn to go consciously, or lucidly,

32
00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.289
from a waking state into the dream state,

33
00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:19.029
and stay there.

34
00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.949
That's really interesting,

35
00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:22.589
it might be the most easy way of being a lucid dreamer.

36
00:01:22.589 --> 00:01:24.169
<v Voiceover>Oh good, we'll talk about that</v>

37
00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:25.009
as soon as you're done with this.

38
00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:25.629
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

39
00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:27.869
And secondly, we don't want to control or manipulate

40
00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:28.649
our dreams.

41
00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.669
We want to exercise conscious choice, yes,

42
00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:31.689
we want to navigate,

43
00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.949
but to say that we want to control or manipulate

44
00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:35.229
the dreamworld is like saying

45
00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.829
we want to control or manipulate the ocean.

46
00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.069
You can't do it.

47
00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.949
I mean, it's ridiculous.

48
00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:39.949
It's bigger than you are.

49
00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:41.949
So what you want to do is learn consciously

50
00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:44.729
to navigate, have more fun, make choice,

51
00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.729
but not try and manipulate.

52
00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.909
<v Voiceover>I like what you were just talking about</v>

53
00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.349
about having a lucid dream prior to going into sleep time.

54
00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:55.869
And then continuing from there.

55
00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.089
Talk about that a little bit,

56
00:01:57.089 --> 00:01:59.029
that's a new concept for most people.

57
00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:01.269
<v ->Well, there's this hypnagogic state, you know,</v>

58
00:02:01.269 --> 00:02:03.469
it's the liminal stage, you're not asleep,

59
00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:04.389
you're not awake,

60
00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:05.809
you're floating, you're drifting in between.

61
00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:07.369
It's a very creative state.

62
00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:08.969
We want to learn to spend more time

63
00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:10.889
in that in between state.

64
00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.409
When you look at the history of creativity,

65
00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.469
scientific discovery, literary breakthroughs,

66
00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:15.629
musical inspiration,

67
00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.849
lots of people have produced lots of interesting results

68
00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.109
in this liminal state of consciousness.

69
00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.169
If you can learn to sustain your lucidity,

70
00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:26.269
your consciousness, in this in between state

71
00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.709
between sleep and waking,

72
00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.089
you can embark on lucid, or conscious dream adventures

73
00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:31.269
any night you like.

74
00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.289
It's great fun.

75
00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:34.789
A good time to do it is first thing in the morning

76
00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:37.316
when you don't have to get out and run off to work

77
00:02:37.316 --> 00:02:38.516
right away,

78
00:02:38.516 --> 00:02:40.036
when a dream is with you perhaps

79
00:02:40.036 --> 00:02:41.876
and you can go on with the dream.

80
00:02:41.876 --> 00:02:45.536
And that's a royal road to conscious or lucid dreaming,

81
00:02:45.536 --> 00:02:46.816
by the way.

82
00:02:46.816 --> 00:02:48.416
You have a dream memory,

83
00:02:48.416 --> 00:02:50.176
it's like a doorway in your mind,

84
00:02:50.176 --> 00:02:52.216
you've been somewhere in your dream,

85
00:02:52.216 --> 00:02:55.336
you can learn to go through that doorway again consciously,

86
00:02:55.336 --> 00:02:58.276
have an adventure, talk to someone in the dream space,

87
00:02:58.276 --> 00:03:01.316
go beyond the dream you remember to a deeper reality,

88
00:03:01.316 --> 00:03:03.856
learn to use a personal dream image as a portal

89
00:03:03.856 --> 00:03:05.676
to the multi-dimensional universe.

90
00:03:05.676 --> 00:03:07.396
And this is great, great fun.

91
00:03:07.396 --> 00:03:09.056
<v Voiceover>Yes, and when you're in that</v>

92
00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:12.936
hypnagogic state, that in between state you speak of,

93
00:03:12.936 --> 00:03:15.396
I've noticed that this is the place,

94
00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:17.036
and you write about it in your book,

95
00:03:17.036 --> 00:03:19.176
where oftentimes you may hear conversations

96
00:03:19.176 --> 00:03:21.956
with other people, you may see people

97
00:03:21.956 --> 00:03:26.136
that are in a halfway, almost an etheric state,

98
00:03:26.136 --> 00:03:29.196
you may see cartoons, you may see anything going on

99
00:03:29.196 --> 00:03:31.116
but this isn't the imagination just

100
00:03:31.116 --> 00:03:33.396
burning off random chemicals.

101
00:03:33.396 --> 00:03:34.436
<v ->No.</v>

102
00:03:34.436 --> 00:03:36.876
This is a portal area.

103
00:03:36.876 --> 00:03:39.836
I mean, they hypnagogic state, the in between state,

104
00:03:39.836 --> 00:03:42.616
you're on the threshold between the worlds.

105
00:03:42.616 --> 00:03:44.896
It's a state when you're psychically receptive,

106
00:03:44.896 --> 00:03:47.616
So you'll become aware of what's going on psychically

107
00:03:47.616 --> 00:03:48.876
in your field.

108
00:03:48.876 --> 00:03:50.516
You'll be aware of people or presences

109
00:03:50.516 --> 00:03:53.376
that might be around that ordinarily you wouldn't hear from.

110
00:03:53.376 --> 00:03:56.336
It's a time when messages come through in that way,

111
00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:57.456
from that world.

112
00:03:57.456 --> 00:03:58.976
And it's a time when you're often given a menu

113
00:03:58.976 --> 00:04:01.296
or smorgasbord of possibilities

114
00:04:01.296 --> 00:04:03.396
for active or conscious dreaming,

115
00:04:03.396 --> 00:04:05.036
you see a parade of faces.

116
00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:08.136
You find yourself drifting in different urban areas

117
00:04:08.136 --> 00:04:09.516
or different landscapes.

118
00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:12.816
You can home in on one of them, make that you focus,

119
00:04:12.816 --> 00:04:14.136
and travel with it.

120
00:04:14.136 --> 00:04:15.816
And you'll receive interesting visitations.

121
00:04:15.816 --> 00:04:17.656
Some of my biggest personal adventures

122
00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:18.736
have come in this state,

123
00:04:18.736 --> 00:04:21.496
when, for example, a certain bird will turn up

124
00:04:21.496 --> 00:04:23.456
and lend me its wings to go on a journey.

125
00:04:23.456 --> 00:04:26.276
It might be the sea eagle which I knew as a boy in Australia

126
00:04:26.276 --> 00:04:27.796
It might be the red-tailed hawk,

127
00:04:27.796 --> 00:04:29.776
which I know very well in North America.

128
00:04:29.776 --> 00:04:31.716
I'll feel the brush of feathers sometimes,

129
00:04:31.716 --> 00:04:33.776
beating against my arm,

130
00:04:33.776 --> 00:04:35.316
and realize that a bird is there,

131
00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:37.376
a bird ally to give me the power of flight

132
00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:40.176
to go somewhere really interesting and have an adventure.

133
00:04:40.176 --> 00:04:42.776
<v Voiceover>And I find this just a fascinating topic,</v>

134
00:04:42.776 --> 00:04:44.376
this in between state.

135
00:04:44.376 --> 00:04:47.896
Because I think first to understand the in between state

136
00:04:47.896 --> 00:04:49.296
you just spoke of as a portal,

137
00:04:49.296 --> 00:04:51.676
I think might be a good time to explain

138
00:04:51.676 --> 00:04:53.516
the state beyond the in between state.

139
00:04:53.516 --> 00:04:54.776
Where do we go?

140
00:04:54.776 --> 00:04:55.936
What are we doing?

141
00:04:55.936 --> 00:04:57.116
<v ->We get out there.</v>

142
00:04:57.116 --> 00:04:58.116
You know, when you look at the very word

143
00:04:58.116 --> 00:05:00.516
for dream in many cultures, in many indigenous cultures,

144
00:05:00.516 --> 00:05:02.316
you'll find that it provides a clue.

145
00:05:02.316 --> 00:05:04.156
For example, among the Makirature,

146
00:05:04.156 --> 00:05:06.136
a shamanic dreaming people of South America,

147
00:05:06.136 --> 00:05:08.696
the word for dream is Atakato,

148
00:05:08.696 --> 00:05:11.816
it means a flight of the soul, a journey of the soul.

149
00:05:11.816 --> 00:05:14.776
The understanding of ancestral and indigenous traditions

150
00:05:14.776 --> 00:05:16.656
is that when we go dreaming we get out there.

151
00:05:16.656 --> 00:05:18.216
We travel beyond the brain.

152
00:05:18.216 --> 00:05:20.776
We travel beyond the laws of Newtonian physics.

153
00:05:20.776 --> 00:05:22.616
We travel across time.

154
00:05:22.616 --> 00:05:25.816
We may travel to the dream time of aboriginal belief.

155
00:05:25.816 --> 00:05:28.896
Which, aboriginals in Australia call the All At Once,

156
00:05:28.896 --> 00:05:29.776
the All At Once.

157
00:05:29.776 --> 00:05:31.116
You're outside time,

158
00:05:31.116 --> 00:05:33.116
you're in a spacious now-time,

159
00:05:33.116 --> 00:05:34.936
where wise teachers are available,

160
00:05:34.936 --> 00:05:36.956
where you can be present at the origin of events

161
00:05:36.956 --> 00:05:40.076
and situations that will manifest in waking life.

162
00:05:40.076 --> 00:05:42.496
So we're talking about multi-dimensional reality.

163
00:05:42.496 --> 00:05:44.196
We're talking about non-local mind.

164
00:05:44.196 --> 00:05:45.816
And I would say that dreams and dreaming

165
00:05:45.816 --> 00:05:47.556
are the royal road to get yourself there

166
00:05:47.556 --> 00:05:49.316
and become a citizen of the multiverse.

167
00:05:49.316 --> 00:05:50.536
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

168
00:05:50.536 --> 00:05:52.576
Yes, I would absolutely agree with that.

169
00:05:52.576 --> 00:05:57.254
And qualitatively, there is a time

170
00:05:57.254 --> 00:05:59.875
in the sleep cycle when,

171
00:05:59.875 --> 00:06:03.375
what, the brain is refreshing itself,

172
00:06:03.375 --> 00:06:06.134
where perhaps you can have some neural firing going on

173
00:06:06.134 --> 00:06:08.495
and maybe some of the things that either

174
00:06:08.495 --> 00:06:10.955
you don't have access to or don't make a lot of sense.

175
00:06:10.955 --> 00:06:12.795
But for the most part when you're dreaming

176
00:06:12.795 --> 00:06:14.595
and traveling into this other dimensional reality

177
00:06:14.595 --> 00:06:15.795
we can be, what?

178
00:06:15.795 --> 00:06:18.255
We can be practicing.

179
00:06:18.255 --> 00:06:21.574
We can be meeting with others, as you say.

180
00:06:21.574 --> 00:06:23.675
What is the full spectrum of what we're doing

181
00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:26.975
that you have reflected back to you through your conferences

182
00:06:26.975 --> 00:06:29.615
<v ->Well there are four reasons why traditional cultures</v>

183
00:06:29.615 --> 00:06:31.835
have regarded dreaming as essential,

184
00:06:31.835 --> 00:06:33.175
absolutely essential.

185
00:06:33.175 --> 00:06:35.195
And I find that these reasons are valid

186
00:06:35.195 --> 00:06:37.695
and they come into focus every time I lead a program

187
00:06:37.695 --> 00:06:40.415
or discuss dreams with someone who's awake to their dreams.

188
00:06:40.415 --> 00:06:42.795
First of all, in dreams we see the future.

189
00:06:42.795 --> 00:06:43.954
We actually visit the future.

190
00:06:43.954 --> 00:06:45.895
Dreams can be memories of the future.

191
00:06:45.895 --> 00:06:47.855
The dream self has gone ahead of the waking self

192
00:06:47.855 --> 00:06:51.055
and returned with some glimpses of what might lie ahead.

193
00:06:51.055 --> 00:06:51.975
You don't like it?

194
00:06:51.975 --> 00:06:53.575
Okay, try and change the future.

195
00:06:53.575 --> 00:06:55.235
Because you've been on a possible path

196
00:06:55.235 --> 00:06:56.615
into a possible future.

197
00:06:56.615 --> 00:06:58.715
You might be able to revise the future event

198
00:06:58.715 --> 00:07:01.115
if you don't like it if you work with the information.

199
00:07:01.115 --> 00:07:03.155
So this is the first thing about dreaming.

200
00:07:03.155 --> 00:07:04.555
We travel into the future.

201
00:07:04.555 --> 00:07:06.915
We return with memories of what the future might hold,

202
00:07:06.915 --> 00:07:08.675
and if we don't like it then we can change the future

203
00:07:08.675 --> 00:07:09.515
for the better.

204
00:07:09.515 --> 00:07:10.435
That is huge.

205
00:07:10.435 --> 00:07:10.835
That's huge.

206
00:07:10.835 --> 00:07:11.475
<v Voiceover>That's huge.</v>

207
00:07:11.475 --> 00:07:13.255
<v ->Western psychology rarely recognizes this</v>

208
00:07:13.255 --> 00:07:14.195
or talks about it,

209
00:07:14.195 --> 00:07:16.234
but it's a fundamental reason for dreaming

210
00:07:16.234 --> 00:07:18.395
for most ancient and indigenous peoples.

211
00:07:18.395 --> 00:07:19.915
Secondly, dreaming is medicine.

212
00:07:19.915 --> 00:07:22.235
You know what, the body knows what's going on inside it.

213
00:07:22.235 --> 00:07:23.895
And one of the ways it tries to speak to us

214
00:07:23.895 --> 00:07:25.135
is through dreams.

215
00:07:25.135 --> 00:07:27.515
So you can read dreams by looking at the landscapes

216
00:07:27.515 --> 00:07:29.195
and conflicts inside the dream,

217
00:07:29.195 --> 00:07:30.895
as scenes from inside the body.

218
00:07:30.895 --> 00:07:33.275
This is not new, this is not a new approach.

219
00:07:33.275 --> 00:07:35.335
Galen, the second most famous physician of the

220
00:07:35.335 --> 00:07:37.474
Ancient Greek world after Hypocrates,

221
00:07:37.474 --> 00:07:39.715
wrote a treaties on diagnosis through dreams,

222
00:07:39.715 --> 00:07:41.375
in which he described, very specifically,

223
00:07:41.375 --> 00:07:43.834
how you want to look at dreams and messages

224
00:07:43.834 --> 00:07:45.594
from the soul or from consciousness

225
00:07:45.594 --> 00:07:47.714
travelling inside the body during the night

226
00:07:47.714 --> 00:07:50.194
on what the body is going through.

227
00:07:50.194 --> 00:07:52.774
And secondly, in terms of dreaming as medicine,

228
00:07:52.774 --> 00:07:54.754
when we get sick, dreams give us images

229
00:07:54.754 --> 00:07:56.054
that can help us to heal.

230
00:07:56.054 --> 00:07:58.074
It's increasingly recognized in medical science

231
00:07:58.074 --> 00:08:00.654
that imagery can be a powerful source of healing.

232
00:08:00.654 --> 00:08:02.833
Where do we get the right images for our bodies?

233
00:08:02.833 --> 00:08:04.613
Dreams will give them to us.

234
00:08:04.613 --> 00:08:07.174
Thirdly, in terms of traditional understanding

235
00:08:07.174 --> 00:08:08.753
of why dreaming matters,

236
00:08:08.753 --> 00:08:11.713
dreaming puts us in touch with a God/Goddess we can talk to.

237
00:08:11.713 --> 00:08:15.593
It puts us in touch with wiser sources than the waking mind.

238
00:08:15.593 --> 00:08:18.213
It puts us in touch with the high self, or greater self,

239
00:08:18.213 --> 00:08:19.853
it puts us in touch with the ancestors

240
00:08:19.853 --> 00:08:21.953
and our authentic spiritual teachers.

241
00:08:21.953 --> 00:08:25.253
Jung said in his last long essay, quote,

242
00:08:25.253 --> 00:08:28.113
"It is an age-old fact that God talks chiefly

243
00:08:28.113 --> 00:08:29.852
through dreams and visions."

244
00:08:29.852 --> 00:08:31.153
He was quite correct.

245
00:08:31.153 --> 00:08:32.533
Whether we speak of God, Goddess,

246
00:08:32.533 --> 00:08:34.492
or the wise source, or the pleroma,

247
00:08:34.492 --> 00:08:36.172
or the higher self,

248
00:08:36.172 --> 00:08:39.613
that larger self is available to us in dreams

249
00:08:39.613 --> 00:08:41.513
and we want to be in touch with that larger source.

250
00:08:41.513 --> 00:08:44.293
And finally, you know, this is all about soul.

251
00:08:44.293 --> 00:08:45.953
Dreaming is all about soul.

252
00:08:45.953 --> 00:08:48.193
One of the things I learned quarter of a century ago,

253
00:08:48.193 --> 00:08:50.133
when I started dreaming of an ancient native woman

254
00:08:50.133 --> 00:08:52.213
who insisted on speaking her own language,

255
00:08:52.213 --> 00:08:54.512
which I had to study in order to understand her.

256
00:08:54.512 --> 00:08:57.333
An archaic form of the Mohawk Indian language.

257
00:08:57.333 --> 00:08:59.633
When I started talking to her 25 years ago,

258
00:08:59.633 --> 00:09:02.503
she taught me something her culture knows.

259
00:09:03.113 --> 00:09:05.276
That dreaming is about soul,

260
00:09:05.276 --> 00:09:07.036
dreams show us what the soul wants,

261
00:09:07.036 --> 00:09:09.356
dreams show us where our soul energy has gone,

262
00:09:09.356 --> 00:09:12.196
and the job of decent people in a community

263
00:09:12.196 --> 00:09:13.376
is to gather round the dream,

264
00:09:13.376 --> 00:09:14.316
or listen to the dream,

265
00:09:14.316 --> 00:09:17.236
and help them notice what the soul is saying

266
00:09:17.236 --> 00:09:20.716
in the dream and act to honor what the sould wants.

267
00:09:20.716 --> 00:09:23.296
That might include remembering and living

268
00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:24.815
our largest story.

269
00:09:24.815 --> 00:09:25.696
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

270
00:09:25.696 --> 00:09:27.615
Now we could go a thousand directions

271
00:09:27.615 --> 00:09:29.776
and I'll have to hone it down to just a few hundred

272
00:09:29.776 --> 00:09:31.856
because we don't have forever.

273
00:09:31.856 --> 00:09:33.656
This is such a fascinating subject,

274
00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:36.956
when you just talked about being within community

275
00:09:36.956 --> 00:09:39.816
and having this elder, or this wise person

276
00:09:39.816 --> 00:09:41.956
at the center of this, guiding this,

277
00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:44.016
you talk also about conscious dreaming

278
00:09:44.016 --> 00:09:47.036
and bringing together groups of dreamers

279
00:09:47.036 --> 00:09:50.176
like book clubs to examine dreams together.

280
00:09:50.176 --> 00:09:52.216
Which I find fascinating.

281
00:09:52.216 --> 00:09:54.855
I actually attempted to do that a few years ago.

282
00:09:54.855 --> 00:09:57.096
It kind of went over morning coffee, right?

283
00:09:57.096 --> 00:10:00.256
But you start seeing this incredible portrait emerge

284
00:10:00.256 --> 00:10:02.036
of similar dreams people are having.

285
00:10:02.036 --> 00:10:04.436
And that's another collective dreaming,

286
00:10:04.436 --> 00:10:05.676
is an an area that's fascinating.

287
00:10:05.676 --> 00:10:09.156
So let's talk about A, recalling our dreams,

288
00:10:09.156 --> 00:10:12.316
how we can assist each other in that through

289
00:10:12.316 --> 00:10:15.096
sharing dreams and collective dreams.

290
00:10:15.096 --> 00:10:16.556
<v ->Well these are very important themes</v>

291
00:10:16.556 --> 00:10:18.516
and many of us are undergoing a dream draught

292
00:10:18.516 --> 00:10:19.456
in our culture.

293
00:10:19.456 --> 00:10:21.076
I mean, our society hasn't rewarded us

294
00:10:21.076 --> 00:10:22.496
for remembering dreams.

295
00:10:22.496 --> 00:10:24.736
It hasn't given us a way of sharing them that's effective.

296
00:10:24.736 --> 00:10:25.616
That's changing.

297
00:10:25.616 --> 00:10:27.176
I've invented a way of sharing dreams,

298
00:10:27.176 --> 00:10:29.696
it's really interesting, it's high energy, it's fun,

299
00:10:29.696 --> 00:10:32.176
and provides strong motivation for remembering dreams

300
00:10:32.176 --> 00:10:34.615
and having a story to bring to the circle.

301
00:10:34.615 --> 00:10:36.456
If you're going through a dream draught

302
00:10:36.456 --> 00:10:39.316
relax, do this, give yourself a juicy intention

303
00:10:39.316 --> 00:10:41.696
any night you want to start tapping into your dreams.

304
00:10:41.696 --> 00:10:42.616
Make it fun.

305
00:10:42.616 --> 00:10:44.016
"I want to meet my dream lover."

306
00:10:44.016 --> 00:10:46.156
"I want to go to Paris and not pay for the plane ticket."

307
00:10:46.156 --> 00:10:48.076
Don't make it another chore.

308
00:10:48.076 --> 00:10:50.415
When you wake up you're going to laze in bed,

309
00:10:50.415 --> 00:10:51.276
see if you've got something.

310
00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:52.716
You don't have anything, spend a bit more time

311
00:10:52.716 --> 00:10:53.856
and roll around in bed.

312
00:10:53.856 --> 00:10:55.976
Sometimes adjusting to the posture your body was in

313
00:10:55.976 --> 00:10:57.616
during the dream brings it back.

314
00:10:57.616 --> 00:10:58.636
You have nothing, fine.

315
00:10:58.636 --> 00:11:00.276
Write something down anyway.

316
00:11:00.276 --> 00:11:01.696
When you write something down anyway

317
00:11:01.696 --> 00:11:02.756
what you're thinking or feeling,

318
00:11:02.756 --> 00:11:04.596
you're saying to your dream producers,

319
00:11:04.596 --> 00:11:06.856
"I am present. I am here. Talk to me."

320
00:11:06.856 --> 00:11:08.596
That might encourage them.

321
00:11:08.596 --> 00:11:12.356
And remember that dreaming is not just about sleep.

322
00:11:12.356 --> 00:11:15.215
The world around us, through signs and synchronicities

323
00:11:15.215 --> 00:11:17.216
and pop-out symbols is speaking to us

324
00:11:17.216 --> 00:11:19.996
in the manner of dreams if we pay attention.

325
00:11:19.996 --> 00:11:22.736
And by learning to pay more attention

326
00:11:22.736 --> 00:11:25.676
to coincidences and symbols in everyday life,

327
00:11:25.676 --> 00:11:27.596
we get into the mode of thinking,

328
00:11:27.596 --> 00:11:29.535
the mode of operating, that encourages

329
00:11:29.535 --> 00:11:32.796
our dreams to come through in the night as well.

330
00:11:32.796 --> 00:11:35.116
We need to do something with our dreams.

331
00:11:35.116 --> 00:11:36.996
If we don't do something with our dreams

332
00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:39.936
we do not dream well and we do not dream so profusely.

333
00:11:39.936 --> 00:11:42.356
Having a method by which you can talk to a friend

334
00:11:42.356 --> 00:11:44.836
or a small group about your dreams,

335
00:11:44.836 --> 00:11:47.655
will mobilize you to gather more material

336
00:11:47.655 --> 00:11:50.216
whether it's from the night or the day.

337
00:11:50.216 --> 00:11:51.496
I've developed a process I call the

338
00:11:51.496 --> 00:11:53.076
Lightening Dreamwork Process,

339
00:11:53.076 --> 00:11:54.376
because it's meant to be quick,

340
00:11:54.376 --> 00:11:55.256
like a lightening bolt,

341
00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:57.236
and it's meant to focus energy, woosh,

342
00:11:57.236 --> 00:11:58.436
like that.

343
00:11:58.436 --> 00:12:01.356
And it's got four steps, you can do it in a few minutes.

344
00:12:01.356 --> 00:12:02.935
This doesn't exhaust what you're going to do

345
00:12:02.935 --> 00:12:03.856
with an interesting dream,

346
00:12:03.856 --> 00:12:05.096
you might work on an interesting dream

347
00:12:05.096 --> 00:12:07.276
or play with it for a very long time.

348
00:12:07.276 --> 00:12:09.376
But it gives you something to do

349
00:12:09.376 --> 00:12:10.835
that you can do with just about anyone,

350
00:12:10.835 --> 00:12:11.896
just about anywhere,

351
00:12:11.896 --> 00:12:14.036
that suits our western hurry sickness.

352
00:12:14.036 --> 00:12:15.136
The four steps are these.

353
00:12:15.136 --> 00:12:17.236
You get the dreamer to tell the dream as a story,

354
00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:19.756
simply and clearly, and you give undivided attention.

355
00:12:19.756 --> 00:12:20.656
That's big.

356
00:12:20.656 --> 00:12:23.235
You're encouraging each other to claim your voice,

357
00:12:23.235 --> 00:12:24.896
tell your story, claim your ground.

358
00:12:24.896 --> 00:12:25.616
That is huge.

359
00:12:25.616 --> 00:12:26.856
Become a storyteller.

360
00:12:26.856 --> 00:12:29.376
Secondly, the partner listening to the dreamer

361
00:12:29.376 --> 00:12:30.736
asks a few basic questions.

362
00:12:30.736 --> 00:12:32.256
The first one is always, "What are your feelings

363
00:12:32.256 --> 00:12:33.356
"around the dream?"

364
00:12:33.356 --> 00:12:34.415
<v Voiceover>And this is critical.</v>

365
00:12:34.415 --> 00:12:34.997
<v ->This is critical.</v>

366
00:12:34.997 --> 00:12:36.056
<v Voiceover>It's not your analysis,</v>

367
00:12:36.056 --> 00:12:36.816
it's your feelings.

368
00:12:36.816 --> 00:12:38.236
<v ->Your first feelings on waking.</v>

369
00:12:38.236 --> 00:12:39.415
Your first feelings on waking

370
00:12:39.415 --> 00:12:41.816
are instant guidance to the general quality of the dream,

371
00:12:41.816 --> 00:12:42.956
whether it's literal or sybolic,

372
00:12:42.956 --> 00:12:45.256
whether it's urgent, big or small.

373
00:12:45.256 --> 00:12:47.956
And one of the other questions is the reality check question

374
00:12:47.956 --> 00:12:49.256
"What do you recognize from this dream

375
00:12:49.256 --> 00:12:51.236
in the rest of your life, and,

376
00:12:51.236 --> 00:12:52.976
could any of this happen in the future

377
00:12:52.976 --> 00:12:54.336
literally or symbolically.

378
00:12:54.336 --> 00:12:56.076
Dreams are orienting us to the future,

379
00:12:56.076 --> 00:12:57.495
we don't want to miss that.

380
00:12:57.495 --> 00:13:00.096
Step three is when you're talking about a dream

381
00:13:00.096 --> 00:13:01.516
you learn to say to each other,

382
00:13:01.516 --> 00:13:03.036
"If it were my dream," or

383
00:13:03.036 --> 00:13:05.476
"If it were my life, this is what I'd think about."

384
00:13:05.476 --> 00:13:08.736
We do not tell people what their dreams or lives mean.

385
00:13:08.736 --> 00:13:11.736
We offer a suggestion from our point of view,

386
00:13:11.736 --> 00:13:13.555
which enforces the idea that the dreamer

387
00:13:13.555 --> 00:13:15.256
is the authority on her own dreams,

388
00:13:15.256 --> 00:13:16.556
dreams belong to the dreamer,

389
00:13:16.556 --> 00:13:18.756
not to some tenured claricy of professionals.

390
00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:20.196
Dreams belong to the dreamers.

391
00:13:20.196 --> 00:13:22.096
And finally we want action.

392
00:13:22.096 --> 00:13:23.154
You've dreamed of something

393
00:13:23.154 --> 00:13:24.834
okay go research that funny word,

394
00:13:24.834 --> 00:13:26.374
go wear the color red.

395
00:13:26.374 --> 00:13:28.754
Go deal with your ex who keeps turning up in your dream.

396
00:13:28.754 --> 00:13:31.353
Burn the wedding dress or be ready for somone

397
00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:33.194
who will present the same challenges in your life

398
00:13:33.194 --> 00:13:33.834
as your ex.

399
00:13:33.834 --> 00:13:34.833
But take action.

400
00:13:34.833 --> 00:13:36.094
Action, action.

401
00:13:36.094 --> 00:13:38.174
In the workshops of course, taking action can be

402
00:13:38.174 --> 00:13:40.474
turning the dream into performance, theater,

403
00:13:40.474 --> 00:13:43.554
expressive art, all sorts of things

404
00:13:43.554 --> 00:13:45.974
to move the energy and not just leave it sort of

405
00:13:45.974 --> 00:13:48.614
as a set of chatter.

406
00:13:48.614 --> 00:13:50.114
<v Voiceover>So to incorporate dream time</v>

407
00:13:50.114 --> 00:13:54.054
information as significant, credible data,

408
00:13:54.054 --> 00:13:57.494
that is there to guide us or inform us,

409
00:13:57.494 --> 00:13:59.594
rather than relegating it to,

410
00:13:59.594 --> 00:14:01.373
"Oh, well it's just a dream."

411
00:14:01.373 --> 00:14:02.834
Because that's the big one,

412
00:14:02.834 --> 00:14:05.794
it's a credibility factor, certainly in the United States.

413
00:14:05.794 --> 00:14:08.414
Oh right, you dreamt something again.

414
00:14:08.414 --> 00:14:10.673
<v ->Uh-huh. Well you know, we have to do better.</v>

415
00:14:10.673 --> 00:14:12.934
We have to learn to check out our dreams,

416
00:14:12.934 --> 00:14:15.374
your big dreams and little dreams.

417
00:14:15.374 --> 00:14:17.494
I mean in Hawaiian there's a whole vocabulary

418
00:14:17.494 --> 00:14:18.894
for dreaming in Hawaiian.

419
00:14:18.894 --> 00:14:20.194
You might have a straight up dream,

420
00:14:20.194 --> 00:14:21.894
which means a clear dream,

421
00:14:21.894 --> 00:14:23.753
a literal dream that is showing you something

422
00:14:23.753 --> 00:14:26.354
in ordinary reality that is happening at a distance

423
00:14:26.354 --> 00:14:27.874
or will happen in the future.

424
00:14:27.874 --> 00:14:29.394
Or you might, in the Hawaiian language

425
00:14:29.394 --> 00:14:31.194
have a wild goat fish dream,

426
00:14:31.194 --> 00:14:32.474
they eat goat fish in Hawaii.

427
00:14:32.474 --> 00:14:34.154
A wild goat fish dream is the result of

428
00:14:34.154 --> 00:14:35.574
eating the wrong food, in the wrong way,

429
00:14:35.574 --> 00:14:36.694
in the wrong season.

430
00:14:36.694 --> 00:14:38.454
And it's a trash dream, you throw it away,

431
00:14:38.454 --> 00:14:39.553
don't pay attention to that.

432
00:14:39.553 --> 00:14:41.313
So we want to be discerning about dreams.

433
00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:42.334
I mean dreams are not equal,

434
00:14:42.334 --> 00:14:43.674
there are dreams that are commentaries

435
00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:45.734
on how we ate last night.

436
00:14:45.734 --> 00:14:48.194
There are dreams that are fairly routine processing,

437
00:14:48.194 --> 00:14:50.954
but basically every dream is worth a look.

438
00:14:50.954 --> 00:14:53.594
Every dream is worth asking a few questions about.

439
00:14:53.594 --> 00:14:56.214
And sometimes it's the mundane, trivial seeming dreams

440
00:14:56.214 --> 00:14:58.314
that contain the most practical guidance

441
00:14:58.314 --> 00:14:59.214
on ordinary life,

442
00:14:59.214 --> 00:15:01.354
because ordinary life can be mundane.

443
00:15:01.354 --> 00:15:04.314
And sometimes there's sort of office dreams

444
00:15:04.314 --> 00:15:06.113
and you'd rather be having some epic adventure,

445
00:15:06.113 --> 00:15:07.754
flying on the back of dragons

446
00:15:07.754 --> 00:15:10.493
to some paradisaical scene.

447
00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:12.574
Sometimes those routine office dreams

448
00:15:12.574 --> 00:15:14.854
contain clues to how to handle yourself

449
00:15:14.854 --> 00:15:17.053
in regular situations and can be very helpful.

450
00:15:17.053 --> 00:15:18.794
So you don't want to throw out any dream material

451
00:15:18.794 --> 00:15:20.094
until you've had a look at it.

452
00:15:20.094 --> 00:15:21.214
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

453
00:15:21.214 --> 00:15:22.314
There are times I've noticed,

454
00:15:22.314 --> 00:15:24.354
where we have repetitive dreams

455
00:15:24.354 --> 00:15:26.574
that happen over a long period of time.

456
00:15:26.574 --> 00:15:27.874
That kind of dream.

457
00:15:27.874 --> 00:15:30.654
And in my own case I had a dream that lasted

458
00:15:30.654 --> 00:15:33.394
from the age of three, the most recent one was

459
00:15:33.394 --> 00:15:34.634
just very recently.

460
00:15:34.634 --> 00:15:36.374
Although they stopped for about a decade,

461
00:15:36.374 --> 00:15:39.494
but it was a progression of mastery in the dream

462
00:15:39.494 --> 00:15:42.854
in this particular task where as I matured and aged

463
00:15:42.854 --> 00:15:44.694
I was more and more proficient,

464
00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:47.354
and then defied odds, defied gravity and all these things

465
00:15:47.354 --> 00:15:48.593
and moved through.

466
00:15:48.593 --> 00:15:49.393
But it was ...

467
00:15:49.393 --> 00:15:51.734
Would you say that that was simply a reflection

468
00:15:51.734 --> 00:15:53.874
of where you are or an encouragement

469
00:15:53.874 --> 00:15:57.974
to continue on, when we have these progressive dreams

470
00:15:57.974 --> 00:16:00.834
of the same theme over a lifetime?

471
00:16:00.834 --> 00:16:03.534
<v ->Well it sounds like a series of magic mirrors,</v>

472
00:16:03.534 --> 00:16:06.773
this particular dream, showing a progression in life,

473
00:16:06.773 --> 00:16:09.114
providing encouragement to continue that progression,

474
00:16:09.114 --> 00:16:11.194
and showing, as if the dream producers are holding up

475
00:16:11.194 --> 00:16:12.993
a mirror saying, this is where you are at this point,

476
00:16:12.993 --> 00:16:15.503
here you are now.

477
00:16:15.963 --> 00:16:18.180
Not simply a reflection of the waking self,

478
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.780
but encouragement and support from a deeper reality

479
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.820
for what the waking self is endeavoring to do.

480
00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.959
You know, recurring dreams, repetitive dreams,

481
00:16:25.959 --> 00:16:29.039
evolving dreams, serial dreams over time

482
00:16:29.039 --> 00:16:32.400
can unfold in various ways and can have different contexts.

483
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.240
It's by observing the serial dream,

484
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.860
the repetitive dream scenes that are evolving over time

485
00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.800
that we learn about parallel realities,

486
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.779
on the human level for example.

487
00:16:41.779 --> 00:16:43.300
The common wisdom of physics today

488
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.199
is that we may live in one of maybe infinite

489
00:16:45.199 --> 00:16:46.820
parallel universes.

490
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.660
How do you understand that on a human experiential level?

491
00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:52.920
Pay attention to dreams in which you are carrying on

492
00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.780
a pathway in your dreams

493
00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:55.939
and things are evolving,

494
00:16:55.939 --> 00:16:57.680
things are going along across time,

495
00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.040
but it's not exactly the ordinary reality you are in.

496
00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.980
So this is a very interesting way of

497
00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.940
checking out for yourself,

498
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.180
from your own information, from your own data,

499
00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.320
the possibility that you are living in one of

500
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.680
several parallel universes.

501
00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.220
<v Voiceover>I think that's true a fair amount</v>

502
00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.980
in my own dreamscape because oftentimes

503
00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.419
I'm in a world that is maybe another dimension

504
00:17:17.419 --> 00:17:19.820
or aspect of earth, it's not scaled the same,

505
00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.990
the animals are different, they're hybridized.

506
00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:26.739
It's different, it's larger.

507
00:17:26.739 --> 00:17:29.799
And this is the most common place I find for dreamscape

508
00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:32.799
is in this other world entirely, it doesn't ...

509
00:17:32.799 --> 00:17:34.339
Large groups of people helping,

510
00:17:34.339 --> 00:17:36.919
moving people around from place to place.

511
00:17:36.919 --> 00:17:37.959
<v ->Yes.</v>

512
00:17:37.959 --> 00:17:39.959
See this is one of the things we need to understand

513
00:17:39.959 --> 00:17:41.359
about the nature of dreaming,

514
00:17:41.359 --> 00:17:42.539
the fields of dreaming,

515
00:17:42.539 --> 00:17:43.939
I mean dreams can be symbolic

516
00:17:43.939 --> 00:17:46.979
and that's where psychologically trained minds go first,

517
00:17:46.979 --> 00:17:48.059
what does this symbol mean?

518
00:17:48.059 --> 00:17:50.338
And that' where the drugstore dream dictionary mind

519
00:17:50.338 --> 00:17:51.319
goes first, look it up.

520
00:17:51.319 --> 00:17:53.079
What does water mean, what does a parrot mean.

521
00:17:53.079 --> 00:17:54.039
<v Voiceover>And it's different to each person,</v>

522
00:17:54.039 --> 00:17:54.599
is it not?

523
00:17:54.599 --> 00:17:55.219
<v ->Different to each person.</v>

524
00:17:55.219 --> 00:17:56.839
So there are symbolic dreams and they're

525
00:17:56.839 --> 00:17:57.939
very important and interesting,

526
00:17:57.939 --> 00:17:59.118
and then there are literal dreams,

527
00:17:59.118 --> 00:18:00.939
or straight-up dreams to quote the Hawaiians,

528
00:18:00.939 --> 00:18:03.379
which are very much about what is happening in this world

529
00:18:03.379 --> 00:18:05.178
and what will happen in the future.

530
00:18:05.178 --> 00:18:07.039
And maybe psychic dreams in the sense that you are

531
00:18:07.039 --> 00:18:09.559
seeing quite clearly things that are distant from you.

532
00:18:09.559 --> 00:18:11.499
And then there are the dreams that are the experiences

533
00:18:11.499 --> 00:18:13.239
of a separate reality all together.

534
00:18:13.239 --> 00:18:16.039
And these, for active dreamers, are the most interesting.

535
00:18:16.039 --> 00:18:18.298
You've given some examples from your own life.

536
00:18:18.298 --> 00:18:21.199
We dream of other times and other lifetimes too,

537
00:18:21.199 --> 00:18:23.319
and from this we may or may not evolve some theory

538
00:18:23.319 --> 00:18:25.817
about our relationship with past or future lives.

539
00:18:25.817 --> 00:18:28.178
I dreamed all my life, for example, of a life which,

540
00:18:28.178 --> 00:18:30.318
a parallel Robert, not in his present body,

541
00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:34.057
is living in Britain and in Europe during World War II.

542
00:18:34.057 --> 00:18:35.258
I've dreamed this all of my life,

543
00:18:35.258 --> 00:18:36.238
I've dreamed it since my childhood.

544
00:18:36.238 --> 00:18:38.138
<v Voiceover>Now could that be a parallel or past?</v>

545
00:18:38.138 --> 00:18:39.838
<v ->Well, you know, the thing about dreaming</v>

546
00:18:39.838 --> 00:18:41.418
is you step out time.

547
00:18:41.418 --> 00:18:44.458
So you can say, "Okay, this is the 1930s."

548
00:18:44.458 --> 00:18:45.198
"Which year is it?"

549
00:18:45.198 --> 00:18:48.098
"This is 1941 in occupied Europe."

550
00:18:48.098 --> 00:18:50.558
Is that about what's happening then

551
00:18:50.558 --> 00:18:52.838
or is it about something happening now

552
00:18:52.838 --> 00:18:56.017
from a point of view that transcends linear clock time?

553
00:18:56.017 --> 00:18:56.798
I don't know.

554
00:18:56.798 --> 00:18:57.818
I know it's relevant to me,

555
00:18:57.818 --> 00:19:00.178
and I know that in my own sense of my life story

556
00:19:00.178 --> 00:19:02.758
the fact that I am dreaming recurringly, again and again

557
00:19:02.758 --> 00:19:06.377
in shifting scenes of adventures in Europe

558
00:19:06.377 --> 00:19:09.157
and in Britain in the 30s and during World War II,

559
00:19:09.157 --> 00:19:11.297
is absolutely fundamental to my understanding

560
00:19:11.297 --> 00:19:12.317
of everything.

561
00:19:12.317 --> 00:19:14.837
<v Voiceover>Yes, that is your alternate reality.</v>

562
00:19:14.837 --> 00:19:15.597
Your other ...

563
00:19:15.597 --> 00:19:17.196
<v ->It's one of the alternate realities.</v>

564
00:19:17.196 --> 00:19:18.117
I also dream of ...

565
00:19:18.117 --> 00:19:20.116
I mean, I became my first job was as a lecturer

566
00:19:20.116 --> 00:19:22.257
in ancient history at the Australia National University.

567
00:19:22.257 --> 00:19:23.996
The reason that I was drawn to that and offered

568
00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:26.337
that job was that as a child I used to dream in Greek.

569
00:19:26.337 --> 00:19:28.496
I'd keep a Greek dictionary by my bedside.

570
00:19:28.496 --> 00:19:29.837
I'm a lazy linguist.

571
00:19:29.837 --> 00:19:31.017
I'm a lazy linguist

572
00:19:31.017 --> 00:19:32.836
But I was given difficult words in Greek

573
00:19:32.836 --> 00:19:34.256
that I had to study.

574
00:19:34.256 --> 00:19:36.376
So we have different styles of dreaming.

575
00:19:36.376 --> 00:19:38.176
One of my patterns of dreaming is I dream

576
00:19:38.176 --> 00:19:40.356
into different cultures into different times.

577
00:19:40.356 --> 00:19:43.136
And it gives me specific leads that I am able to follow up.

578
00:19:43.136 --> 00:19:44.796
I mean, I'm a historian, I've been a journalist,

579
00:19:44.796 --> 00:19:47.776
I know how to do hard research, I like to check sources,

580
00:19:47.776 --> 00:19:50.716
I don't like fluffy new-age thinking about these things.

581
00:19:50.716 --> 00:19:51.895
So I check these things out.

582
00:19:51.895 --> 00:19:54.856
So in my dreams I am often given specific details,

583
00:19:54.856 --> 00:19:56.476
strange words, strange details,

584
00:19:56.476 --> 00:19:58.896
places, dates, et cetera, which I can check out.

585
00:19:58.896 --> 00:20:00.556
And I've developed this central practice

586
00:20:00.556 --> 00:20:02.096
I call dream archaeology.

587
00:20:02.096 --> 00:20:03.936
You're given some clues to a different culture,

588
00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:05.856
a different place, you can check them out.

589
00:20:05.856 --> 00:20:07.616
You bring the best of scholarship and science

590
00:20:07.616 --> 00:20:09.056
to bear on it and then you have something

591
00:20:09.056 --> 00:20:10.176
really interesting.

592
00:20:10.176 --> 00:20:12.116
Recently, for example, I've been teaching in the Baltic.

593
00:20:12.116 --> 00:20:15.456
I'm very excited by this, I was just in Latvia and Estonia.

594
00:20:15.456 --> 00:20:17.596
I've been to Lithuania three times.

595
00:20:17.596 --> 00:20:18.836
These are countries that have been through

596
00:20:18.836 --> 00:20:20.756
one of the most grueling nightmares of history

597
00:20:20.756 --> 00:20:21.696
that we know about,

598
00:20:21.696 --> 00:20:24.076
the Germans on one side and the Russians on the other.

599
00:20:24.076 --> 00:20:26.896
Trodden on by everybody, brutalized by everybody.

600
00:20:26.896 --> 00:20:29.016
Going to these countries to bring back the dreaming

601
00:20:29.016 --> 00:20:30.936
is an act of cultural soul recovery.

602
00:20:30.936 --> 00:20:31.756
<v Voiceover>Let me ask you a question,</v>

603
00:20:31.756 --> 00:20:33.775
when you have a people that have been so traumatized,

604
00:20:33.775 --> 00:20:36.856
and repressed and as you say, from each direction,

605
00:20:36.856 --> 00:20:39.856
do they often start losing their dream memory?

606
00:20:39.856 --> 00:20:43.436
Or are their dreams seriously impacted

607
00:20:43.436 --> 00:20:45.926
by these experiences collectively?

608
00:20:45.926 --> 00:20:47.856
<v ->I think that there was an effort to destroy</v>

609
00:20:47.856 --> 00:20:50.456
the imagination, I mean to destroy the collective mind

610
00:20:50.456 --> 00:20:52.296
and spirit of these peoples.

611
00:20:52.296 --> 00:20:54.116
I mean the sheer loss of population,

612
00:20:54.116 --> 00:20:57.456
the forced deportations, the mass murders of the population

613
00:20:57.456 --> 00:20:59.996
the effort to corrupt and distort the imagination,

614
00:20:59.996 --> 00:21:01.556
had a terrible effect.

615
00:21:01.556 --> 00:21:03.516
But bringing back the dreaming,

616
00:21:03.516 --> 00:21:06.296
and bringing back some ancestral traditions

617
00:21:06.296 --> 00:21:08.676
that transcend and precede all that horror

618
00:21:08.676 --> 00:21:10.176
is an act of healing.

619
00:21:10.176 --> 00:21:12.756
And I've found people flocking to my workshops

620
00:21:12.756 --> 00:21:14.096
to learn how to dream again

621
00:21:14.096 --> 00:21:16.436
and to learn how to share things with each other.

622
00:21:16.436 --> 00:21:18.535
Different phenomena in different parts of the region.

623
00:21:18.535 --> 00:21:20.336
In one of the countries people were very shy

624
00:21:20.336 --> 00:21:22.095
about saying too much in front of others

625
00:21:22.095 --> 00:21:23.596
because although they've been independent

626
00:21:23.596 --> 00:21:26.035
for 20 years now, it's only 20 years.

627
00:21:26.035 --> 00:21:27.536
And they all remember in their families,

628
00:21:27.536 --> 00:21:30.396
a time when it was terribly dangerous to say anything

629
00:21:30.396 --> 00:21:33.196
that you held true in the presence of others

630
00:21:33.196 --> 00:21:35.975
under totalitarian dictatorship.

631
00:21:35.975 --> 00:21:39.496
So I'm finding that a very interesting thing.

632
00:21:39.496 --> 00:21:41.095
And one of the things that's going on there

633
00:21:41.095 --> 00:21:43.476
is that we, in these workshops in the Baltic,

634
00:21:43.476 --> 00:21:47.235
including I, myself, are dreaming of authentic sources

635
00:21:47.235 --> 00:21:49.275
on the ancient traditions of these countries.

636
00:21:49.275 --> 00:21:50.676
When I first went to Lithuania

637
00:21:50.676 --> 00:21:53.236
I led a group journey for ancestral knowledge.

638
00:21:53.236 --> 00:21:56.216
I found myself talking to an ancestral priestess of Zemyna

639
00:21:56.216 --> 00:21:58.336
the great earth goddess of Lithuania,

640
00:21:58.336 --> 00:22:01.176
who insisted on speaking to me in ancient Lithuanian.

641
00:22:01.176 --> 00:22:03.696
Showed me some techniques of healing and divination

642
00:22:03.696 --> 00:22:05.816
which I have, was able to check out with the group

643
00:22:05.816 --> 00:22:08.776
and we found ourselves engaged in restoring

644
00:22:08.776 --> 00:22:10.756
authentic sources, goddess sources,

645
00:22:10.756 --> 00:22:13.115
of the old goddess tradition of the Baltic.

646
00:22:13.115 --> 00:22:14.996
Which had not died completely,

647
00:22:14.996 --> 00:22:17.536
Marija Gimbutas's work is an illustration of that,

648
00:22:17.536 --> 00:22:19.616
that it didn't die completely but has been buried

649
00:22:19.616 --> 00:22:21.176
and repressed.

650
00:22:21.176 --> 00:22:23.456
So you know, dreaming is a key to all these things.

651
00:22:23.456 --> 00:22:24.475
It's a key to soul.

652
00:22:24.475 --> 00:22:25.855
It's in our individual lives,

653
00:22:25.855 --> 00:22:28.495
it's a key to finding where our vital energy

654
00:22:28.495 --> 00:22:30.496
or identity might have gone because of trauma,

655
00:22:30.496 --> 00:22:32.036
pain, abuse, addiction,

656
00:22:32.036 --> 00:22:34.035
in our lives when we lost a part of ourselves,

657
00:22:34.035 --> 00:22:35.376
we lost that beautiful teenager

658
00:22:35.376 --> 00:22:37.556
or that young child went missing.

659
00:22:37.556 --> 00:22:39.096
Dreaming will show us how to get back

660
00:22:39.096 --> 00:22:41.875
more of ourselves and it will show us as communities

661
00:22:41.875 --> 00:22:43.915
how to bring back soul and heart and spirit

662
00:22:43.915 --> 00:22:46.436
to collective groups as well.

663
00:22:46.436 --> 00:22:48.316
<v Voiceover>And that's something that's needed globally.</v>

664
00:22:48.316 --> 00:22:49.096
<v ->It's needed everywhere.</v>

665
00:22:49.096 --> 00:22:50.356
<v Voiceover>The globe is being stressed</v>

666
00:22:50.356 --> 00:22:51.576
from every front right now.

667
00:22:51.576 --> 00:22:52.576
<v ->It's needed everywhere.</v>

668
00:22:52.576 --> 00:22:54.496
One of the functions of dreamers in traditional

669
00:22:54.496 --> 00:22:56.176
societies is to communicate,

670
00:22:56.176 --> 00:22:58.056
not just with their personal subconscious,

671
00:22:58.056 --> 00:23:00.116
and not just with each other,

672
00:23:00.116 --> 00:23:01.936
although dreaming is a social activity,

673
00:23:01.936 --> 00:23:03.596
we meet other people, we want to do that,

674
00:23:03.596 --> 00:23:05.896
but to dream with the animate spirits of the earth.

675
00:23:05.896 --> 00:23:08.216
To dream with earth and sea, and mountain and tree,

676
00:23:08.216 --> 00:23:09.356
and animal.

677
00:23:09.356 --> 00:23:11.176
And if we're liking that, we're liking a dimension

678
00:23:11.176 --> 00:23:12.776
of our humanity and our ability

679
00:23:12.776 --> 00:23:14.696
to survive and prosper on this planet

680
00:23:14.696 --> 00:23:16.216
and to maintain the balance.

681
00:23:16.216 --> 00:23:18.056
So dreaming is as important as that.

682
00:23:18.056 --> 00:23:19.456
We need speakers for the trees,

683
00:23:19.456 --> 00:23:21.096
we need speakers for the ocean.

684
00:23:21.096 --> 00:23:22.896
Not just environmental warriors,

685
00:23:22.896 --> 00:23:23.775
we need them too,

686
00:23:23.775 --> 00:23:26.315
but people who are actually, directly in contact

687
00:23:26.315 --> 00:23:30.055
with the animate forces and intelligences of the earth.

688
00:23:30.055 --> 00:23:33.255
This is one of the things that dreamers can provide.

689
00:23:33.255 --> 00:23:34.255
<v Voiceover>Beautiful.</v>

690
00:23:34.255 --> 00:23:36.235
And while we're talking about all of this,

691
00:23:36.235 --> 00:23:38.075
if you run into most people in the street

692
00:23:38.075 --> 00:23:39.455
and ask, "What was your dream last night?"

693
00:23:39.455 --> 00:23:41.355
"Oh, I don't remember my dreams."

694
00:23:41.355 --> 00:23:43.775
And a part of that is because of the shock

695
00:23:43.775 --> 00:23:48.155
of a culture in which work is put above everything else

696
00:23:48.155 --> 00:23:50.054
and we shock ourselves awake in the morning,

697
00:23:50.054 --> 00:23:52.095
slam down the first cup of tea or coffee

698
00:23:52.095 --> 00:23:53.695
and go on about it.

699
00:23:53.695 --> 00:23:55.755
Because we don't value the dreams,

700
00:23:55.755 --> 00:23:58.535
we haven't instructed ourselves to bring our dreams to us.

701
00:23:58.535 --> 00:24:02.875
We have this kind of mass amnesia about our dreams.

702
00:24:02.875 --> 00:24:05.255
So you have ways in which to help people

703
00:24:05.255 --> 00:24:07.235
retrieve dreams and I love it.

704
00:24:07.235 --> 00:24:10.295
One of the chapters, The Place of Lost and Found Dreams,

705
00:24:10.295 --> 00:24:14.034
(laughs) let's talk about that a little bit.

706
00:24:14.034 --> 00:24:16.302
<v ->It started for me one morning when I didn't remember</v>

707
00:24:16.302 --> 00:24:17.182
any of my own dreams.

708
00:24:17.182 --> 00:24:18.062
I thought, "This is no good.

709
00:24:18.062 --> 00:24:19.902
"Robert the great dreamer, where are your dreams?"

710
00:24:19.902 --> 00:24:22.742
So I decided to see what I could do about that

711
00:24:22.742 --> 00:24:24.342
and I found myself going to a place

712
00:24:24.342 --> 00:24:27.322
like the greatest video store you could possibly imagine.

713
00:24:27.322 --> 00:24:28.282
It's a wide awake dream.

714
00:24:28.282 --> 00:24:30.022
I'm lying in bed and I'm finding myself

715
00:24:30.022 --> 00:24:32.862
crossing the threshold, which is like a flowerbed

716
00:24:32.862 --> 00:24:35.302
that is also a doormat to this fantastic sort of

717
00:24:35.302 --> 00:24:36.922
cosmic video store,

718
00:24:36.922 --> 00:24:39.162
where I'm received by this attendent.

719
00:24:39.162 --> 00:24:41.562
And I'm shown file upon file, rank upon rank

720
00:24:41.562 --> 00:24:43.842
of DVDs from categories, you know,

721
00:24:43.842 --> 00:24:45.922
family, adult, drama, thriller,

722
00:24:45.922 --> 00:24:48.482
and categories we don't have in ordinary video stores.

723
00:24:48.482 --> 00:24:50.462
All my dreams.

724
00:24:50.462 --> 00:24:54.161
And I find in the waking dream I can select a DVD

725
00:24:54.161 --> 00:24:56.822
and play it and then it's a sense around movie

726
00:24:56.822 --> 00:24:57.922
and I enter it, et cetera.

727
00:24:57.922 --> 00:25:00.422
And I notice in this cosmic video store,

728
00:25:00.422 --> 00:25:01.902
the whole section devoted to my dreams

729
00:25:01.902 --> 00:25:03.602
with other people, dreams I've shared with friends,

730
00:25:03.602 --> 00:25:05.382
adventures I've had with other people.

731
00:25:05.382 --> 00:25:08.282
so this is one of the locations I've discovered

732
00:25:08.282 --> 00:25:11.021
we could learn to go to to look for our lost dreams

733
00:25:11.021 --> 00:25:13.542
another version would be the cinema of lost dreams,

734
00:25:13.542 --> 00:25:15.241
or the post office of lost dreams

735
00:25:15.241 --> 00:25:17.502
where you pick up the mail that you haven't been collecting.

736
00:25:17.502 --> 00:25:19.602
So in some of the workshops, and in the book,

737
00:25:19.602 --> 00:25:21.441
I suggest you can do this at home.

738
00:25:21.441 --> 00:25:23.162
I encourage people to go to a space

739
00:25:23.162 --> 00:25:24.982
where they can pick up some of the dream messages

740
00:25:24.982 --> 00:25:26.822
that they've been losing.

741
00:25:26.822 --> 00:25:28.760
<v Voiceover>I think that's an excellent idea</v>

742
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.560
and I think one of the problems or challenges

743
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.637
that certainly more Western cultures likely have

744
00:25:34.637 --> 00:25:36.037
wherever you have a dominance of logic

745
00:25:36.037 --> 00:25:37.238
and left-brain thinking,

746
00:25:37.238 --> 00:25:39.938
is this question as to,

747
00:25:39.938 --> 00:25:42.778
"Oh but what if I'm just making up everything."

748
00:25:42.778 --> 00:25:44.698
When you talk about taking this information

749
00:25:44.698 --> 00:25:46.298
and taking action on it,

750
00:25:46.298 --> 00:25:47.578
the question arises,

751
00:25:47.578 --> 00:25:49.677
"What if I'm just making it all up?"

752
00:25:49.677 --> 00:25:50.718
<v ->But I love making it up.</v>

753
00:25:50.718 --> 00:25:52.297
I mean we have a song we sing in the workshops,

754
00:25:52.297 --> 00:25:53.638
"Make it up as you go along,

755
00:25:53.638 --> 00:25:55.078
"The way will show the way."

756
00:25:55.078 --> 00:25:56.337
I mean, children understand this,

757
00:25:56.337 --> 00:25:57.998
the magic of making things up.

758
00:25:57.998 --> 00:26:00.218
It's about bringing back the art of imagination.

759
00:26:00.218 --> 00:26:02.258
Real shamans are masters of imagination

760
00:26:02.258 --> 00:26:04.138
and suggestion.

761
00:26:04.138 --> 00:26:07.088
Rabindranath Tagore said, with a poet's clarity,

762
00:26:07.088 --> 00:26:08.873
he said the stronger the imagination,

763
00:26:08.873 --> 00:26:10.953
the less imaginary the results.

764
00:26:10.953 --> 00:26:13.333
So a lot of this is about learning to make it up.

765
00:26:13.333 --> 00:26:16.113
It's a story from history in active dreaming

766
00:26:16.113 --> 00:26:18.013
which you may recognize,

767
00:26:18.013 --> 00:26:20.854
as it involves a famous Viennese psychiatrist called

768
00:26:20.854 --> 00:26:21.714
Victor Frankel.

769
00:26:21.714 --> 00:26:23.153
<v Voiceover>Yes, it's a beautiful story.</v>

770
00:26:23.153 --> 00:26:25.514
<v ->He was in Auschwitz during World War II.</v>

771
00:26:25.514 --> 00:26:27.633
He's reduced to a skeleton with a tattoo on his arm,

772
00:26:27.633 --> 00:26:29.313
there's no possibility of any hope,

773
00:26:29.313 --> 00:26:31.153
he can be killed at any moment.

774
00:26:31.153 --> 00:26:33.373
His world smells of blood and excrement.

775
00:26:33.373 --> 00:26:37.013
And he decides in the situation to grow a vision in his mind

776
00:26:37.013 --> 00:26:39.313
an impossible vision, to make something up.

777
00:26:39.313 --> 00:26:41.693
He makes up in his imagination,

778
00:26:41.693 --> 00:26:44.413
a vision of a world in which the Nazis are past history.

779
00:26:44.413 --> 00:26:47.493
In which he is comfortably, comfortably well-fed

780
00:26:47.493 --> 00:26:49.834
and well-dressed in a pleasant auditorium

781
00:26:49.834 --> 00:26:51.774
with well-upholstered seats,

782
00:26:51.774 --> 00:26:53.694
giving a lecture on the psychology

783
00:26:53.694 --> 00:26:55.253
of the concentration camps.

784
00:26:55.253 --> 00:26:57.173
Not only has he survived,

785
00:26:57.173 --> 00:26:59.273
but as a psychiatrist, an original mind,

786
00:26:59.273 --> 00:27:01.334
he is making sense and philosophy

787
00:27:01.334 --> 00:27:03.274
out of the horror that he survived.

788
00:27:03.274 --> 00:27:06.614
He says that that active imagination got him through.

789
00:27:06.614 --> 00:27:07.974
When I feel sorry for myself

790
00:27:07.974 --> 00:27:10.174
or I see other people feeling sorry for themselves,

791
00:27:10.174 --> 00:27:12.754
I think about that and I think about what it can be

792
00:27:12.754 --> 00:27:17.393
to make up a vision of possibility that wants

793
00:27:17.393 --> 00:27:18.954
to take root in your world.

794
00:27:18.954 --> 00:27:20.873
So I'm in favor of making things up.

795
00:27:20.873 --> 00:27:23.034
One of the things that I do is I teach people

796
00:27:23.034 --> 00:27:26.022
the practice of imagination.

797
00:27:26.273 --> 00:27:27.993
<v Voiceover>When you're in the process of doing this</v>

798
00:27:27.993 --> 00:27:29.172
and dealing with people, as you say,

799
00:27:29.172 --> 00:27:31.153
from war-torn, damaged regions

800
00:27:31.153 --> 00:27:34.173
such as where you recently were along the Baltic,

801
00:27:34.173 --> 00:27:38.193
to American cities, European cities,

802
00:27:38.193 --> 00:27:40.913
what is the greatest barrier for people

803
00:27:40.913 --> 00:27:44.953
giving themselves permission to simply daydream

804
00:27:44.953 --> 00:27:48.213
and make things up and use their imagination?

805
00:27:48.213 --> 00:27:50.233
Why is there something attached to that?

806
00:27:50.233 --> 00:27:52.873
A fear almost attached to it in a lot of people.

807
00:27:52.873 --> 00:27:55.153
<v ->The greatest barrier is actually an absence.</v>

808
00:27:55.153 --> 00:27:57.692
It's the absence of the child inside you.

809
00:27:57.692 --> 00:28:00.633
Because the child inside you knows about

810
00:28:00.633 --> 00:28:01.892
the magic of making things up,

811
00:28:01.892 --> 00:28:04.332
has all the imagination you can every need,

812
00:28:04.332 --> 00:28:06.853
is the master of dreams and imagination.

813
00:28:06.853 --> 00:28:09.033
One of the early chapters in Active Dreaming,

814
00:28:09.033 --> 00:28:11.653
I quote my youngest daughter when she was four years-old.

815
00:28:11.653 --> 00:28:12.772
She came to me and she said,

816
00:28:12.772 --> 00:28:14.513
"You know, daddy, I go to a special place

817
00:28:14.513 --> 00:28:15.812
called Teddy Bear Land."

818
00:28:15.812 --> 00:28:17.272
"Yes, I've heard about that."

819
00:28:17.272 --> 00:28:19.133
"Do you want to know how I go there?" She says.

820
00:28:19.133 --> 00:28:20.592
She's four years old.

821
00:28:20.592 --> 00:28:21.652
"Sure."

822
00:28:21.652 --> 00:28:24.092
She says, "Sometimes I take the Sun Gate,

823
00:28:24.092 --> 00:28:26.292
sometimes I take the Moon Gate.

824
00:28:26.292 --> 00:28:28.492
Sometimes I take the Rainbow Bridge

825
00:28:28.492 --> 00:28:32.193
and sometimes I just punch a hole in the world."

826
00:28:32.193 --> 00:28:33.673
"I punch a hole in the world."

827
00:28:33.673 --> 00:28:35.853
That's the natural shamanism of a child.

828
00:28:35.853 --> 00:28:37.413
That's not because she's my daughter,

829
00:28:37.413 --> 00:28:39.572
that's the natural shamanism of a young child.

830
00:28:39.572 --> 00:28:42.613
So if we have difficulty exercising imagination,

831
00:28:42.613 --> 00:28:44.073
if we have difficulty giving ourselves

832
00:28:44.073 --> 00:28:46.113
permission to think outside the boxes,

833
00:28:46.113 --> 00:28:49.213
it's because we have allowed ourselves to become estranged

834
00:28:49.213 --> 00:28:51.953
from the child of wonder, the wunderkind,

835
00:28:51.953 --> 00:28:53.852
the child of wonder inside ourselves.

836
00:28:53.852 --> 00:28:55.433
And one of the essential things I do

837
00:28:55.433 --> 00:28:57.513
is I help as to bring that child back

838
00:28:57.513 --> 00:29:00.852
Sometimes it involves reaching beyond what is within us,

839
00:29:00.852 --> 00:29:03.012
to finding the child who has been exiled some

840
00:29:03.012 --> 00:29:04.833
and a realm of lost boys and girls

841
00:29:04.833 --> 00:29:06.753
through what shamans call soul loss,

842
00:29:06.753 --> 00:29:08.612
and finding that child of wonder

843
00:29:08.612 --> 00:29:11.073
and bringing it back and putting it in the heart.

844
00:29:11.073 --> 00:29:13.912
I was recently in France and there was a woman there,

845
00:29:13.912 --> 00:29:15.392
a residential workshop,

846
00:29:15.392 --> 00:29:17.732
she said on close of the first day,

847
00:29:17.732 --> 00:29:19.032
"Robert, I don't know what I'm doing here

848
00:29:19.032 --> 00:29:20.492
"I don't dream, I haven't remembered a dream

849
00:29:20.492 --> 00:29:22.472
"since I was seven years-old."

850
00:29:22.472 --> 00:29:23.652
She was 37.

851
00:29:23.652 --> 00:29:25.012
No dreams for 30 years.

852
00:29:25.012 --> 00:29:27.572
I said, "Okay, tell me the last dream."

853
00:29:27.572 --> 00:29:30.093
She says, "In my last dream, when I was seven,

854
00:29:30.093 --> 00:29:32.033
"A hand is reaching from behind a curtain,

855
00:29:32.033 --> 00:29:33.973
"it's offering me chocolate, and I like chocolate.

856
00:29:33.973 --> 00:29:36.093
"But I'm scared because it's a disembodied arm

857
00:29:36.093 --> 00:29:37.852
"and I can't see who's offering the chocolate.

858
00:29:37.852 --> 00:29:39.232
"I wake up screaming.

859
00:29:39.232 --> 00:29:41.892
"My parents say 'Go back to sleep it's just a dream.'

860
00:29:41.892 --> 00:29:43.273
"And I pray," she says,

861
00:29:43.273 --> 00:29:44.272
"for no more dreams.

862
00:29:44.272 --> 00:29:46.173
"I don't want any dreams, I'm so terrified.

863
00:29:46.173 --> 00:29:47.092
"No more dreams."

864
00:29:47.092 --> 00:29:47.993
Her prayer was answered.

865
00:29:47.993 --> 00:29:50.332
For 30 years she's remembered no dreams.

866
00:29:50.332 --> 00:29:51.693
So I say to her, "Okay, good.

867
00:29:51.693 --> 00:29:53.913
"How would you like to go back inside?

868
00:29:53.913 --> 00:29:56.893
"Consciously, go back inside the last dream you remember.

869
00:29:56.893 --> 00:29:59.293
"Open the curtain and see what's behind it?"

870
00:29:59.293 --> 00:30:01.433
"Oh," she's a little bit nervous.

871
00:30:01.433 --> 00:30:02.513
But she agrees to do it.

872
00:30:02.513 --> 00:30:04.613
Now it's a workshop, we're using shamanic drumming,

873
00:30:04.613 --> 00:30:06.153
shifting consciousness with the aid of this

874
00:30:06.153 --> 00:30:08.232
primal effective technology.

875
00:30:08.232 --> 00:30:09.892
And she's given support.

876
00:30:09.892 --> 00:30:12.052
She's invited two people to come as her friends,

877
00:30:12.052 --> 00:30:13.492
into her dreamspace

878
00:30:13.492 --> 00:30:16.013
to help her open the curtain and be bodyguards

879
00:30:16.013 --> 00:30:17.673
if necessary.

880
00:30:17.673 --> 00:30:19.592
So here she is, 30 years on,

881
00:30:19.592 --> 00:30:22.232
opening the curtain in a conscious dream,

882
00:30:22.232 --> 00:30:24.213
a lucid, wide awake dream adventure,

883
00:30:24.213 --> 00:30:25.312
and behind the curtain she finds

884
00:30:25.312 --> 00:30:28.153
a being that is almost angelic in it's beauty.

885
00:30:28.153 --> 00:30:30.272
And she recognizes him eventually as a man

886
00:30:30.272 --> 00:30:32.112
she loved when she was a small girl.

887
00:30:32.112 --> 00:30:33.993
He was her father's best friend.

888
00:30:33.993 --> 00:30:37.192
He'd been killed in an accident shortly before the dream.

889
00:30:37.192 --> 00:30:40.053
And she says, "Why couldn't I see your face?"

890
00:30:40.053 --> 00:30:42.273
He said, "My face was horribly mutilated,

891
00:30:42.273 --> 00:30:44.513
"I didn't want to frighten you

892
00:30:44.513 --> 00:30:47.692
"so I held myself secret behind the curtain

893
00:30:47.692 --> 00:30:49.313
"while giving you a gift."

894
00:30:49.313 --> 00:30:51.273
That night, and this is so beautiful

895
00:30:51.273 --> 00:30:53.252
and there are tears flowing and it's lovely,

896
00:30:53.252 --> 00:30:55.913
and that night, she dreams up a storm.

897
00:30:55.913 --> 00:30:57.952
At the breakfast table she says

898
00:30:57.952 --> 00:31:00.552
"My dreams went through the night like a high speed train,

899
00:31:00.552 --> 00:31:02.792
a train grande vitesse, vroom, vroom, vroom."

900
00:31:02.792 --> 00:31:05.392
At the breakfast table she tells us eight dreams

901
00:31:05.392 --> 00:31:06.352
from one night.

902
00:31:06.352 --> 00:31:07.873
The woman who's remembered no dreams

903
00:31:07.873 --> 00:31:11.653
for 30 years because she went back into an old dream

904
00:31:11.653 --> 00:31:13.513
and in the process she got back in touch

905
00:31:13.513 --> 00:31:14.933
with her child self.

906
00:31:14.933 --> 00:31:16.573
And the child self was now helping her to

907
00:31:16.573 --> 00:31:18.873
deliver all the dreams and all the soul energy

908
00:31:18.873 --> 00:31:19.992
that was missing.

909
00:31:19.992 --> 00:31:21.573
<v Voiceover>Ah, that's a beautiful story.</v>

910
00:31:21.573 --> 00:31:23.373
<v ->This is the kind of thing that I do,</v>

911
00:31:23.373 --> 00:31:24.432
and this is why I do it.

912
00:31:24.432 --> 00:31:25.632
Sometimes people will ask me,

913
00:31:25.632 --> 00:31:27.292
"Robert, why do you travel so much?

914
00:31:27.292 --> 00:31:29.033
"Why do you work all the time at these workshops?"

915
00:31:29.033 --> 00:31:31.092
I say "It's because I love to see the light of spirit

916
00:31:31.092 --> 00:31:33.312
"come on in people's eyes when their dream

917
00:31:33.312 --> 00:31:36.122
"and their soul has come back to them."

918
00:31:37.592 --> 00:31:39.892
<v Voiceover>Well, let's talk about,</v>

919
00:31:39.892 --> 00:31:41.933
just for a moment here,

920
00:31:41.933 --> 00:31:43.313
another kind of dream entirely,

921
00:31:43.313 --> 00:31:44.913
which might be a collective,

922
00:31:44.913 --> 00:31:48.112
it might be an awareness that needs to surface,

923
00:31:48.112 --> 00:31:49.892
it might be a warning.

924
00:31:49.892 --> 00:31:51.893
I wrote a blog about this recently

925
00:31:51.893 --> 00:31:54.883
that received quite a few responses.

926
00:31:55.292 --> 00:31:56.453
And I put it out there,

927
00:31:56.453 --> 00:31:58.812
I normally do not share my dreams or anything,

928
00:31:58.812 --> 00:32:01.153
personal things in blogs, per se,

929
00:32:01.153 --> 00:32:03.473
but in this one I felt it was necessary.

930
00:32:03.473 --> 00:32:06.653
And sure enough, within an hour or two

931
00:32:06.653 --> 00:32:08.013
the comments started,

932
00:32:08.013 --> 00:32:10.492
"Oh yes, I've seen the same thing in my dream.

933
00:32:10.492 --> 00:32:12.972
"I've seen this, my daughter's seen the same thing."

934
00:32:12.972 --> 00:32:14.773
And the reason I had originally brought it up

935
00:32:14.773 --> 00:32:18.692
is because a friend who psychically I'm very, very close to

936
00:32:18.692 --> 00:32:22.192
and I, had the same dream at the same time.

937
00:32:22.192 --> 00:32:24.353
And that dream mutated into the same thing

938
00:32:24.353 --> 00:32:26.903
at the same time.

939
00:32:28.032 --> 00:32:30.693
<v ->I'm hovering, waiting to hear what the dream is.</v>

940
00:32:30.693 --> 00:32:33.582
<v Voiceover>Oh, it was actually ...</v>

941
00:32:34.532 --> 00:32:38.212
My version of it was in the dream time,

942
00:32:38.212 --> 00:32:39.993
a large black helicopter,

943
00:32:39.993 --> 00:32:43.172
one of the military types that are called black helicopters,

944
00:32:43.172 --> 00:32:45.293
flew overhead, they're unmarked.

945
00:32:45.293 --> 00:32:47.812
I've seen them in real life before.

946
00:32:47.812 --> 00:32:49.293
Came overhead and was hovering

947
00:32:49.293 --> 00:32:52.572
and suddenly turned into a cubical type of craft

948
00:32:52.572 --> 00:32:54.253
that started spinning on it's side

949
00:32:54.253 --> 00:32:56.433
it was very mesmerizing for myself and the others

950
00:32:56.433 --> 00:32:58.293
standing on the ground.

951
00:32:58.293 --> 00:33:01.793
Next thing that happened is this cubicle type,

952
00:33:01.793 --> 00:33:02.952
almost a fence,

953
00:33:02.952 --> 00:33:05.812
it was an odd grid-like thing,

954
00:33:05.812 --> 00:33:08.172
I realized "Oh goodness, that's a UFO."

955
00:33:08.172 --> 00:33:09.573
It showed itself as a black helicopter,

956
00:33:09.573 --> 00:33:11.912
it morphed and it's a UFO.

957
00:33:11.912 --> 00:33:14.512
Next thing I knew there wa a lapse of time,

958
00:33:14.512 --> 00:33:17.433
it came down around all of us

959
00:33:17.433 --> 00:33:20.012
and we were inside the same structure

960
00:33:20.012 --> 00:33:21.953
but it looked like a fence.

961
00:33:21.953 --> 00:33:23.233
And I said, "We're not in a fence,

962
00:33:23.233 --> 00:33:25.053
"this is a UFO."

963
00:33:25.053 --> 00:33:26.773
My friend was having the same dream

964
00:33:26.773 --> 00:33:28.573
but she was fighting the feeling.

965
00:33:28.573 --> 00:33:30.333
She had no lapsing time.

966
00:33:30.333 --> 00:33:32.352
She was fighting the feeling that was happening

967
00:33:32.352 --> 00:33:35.492
because in the dream she was starting to go into this

968
00:33:35.492 --> 00:33:38.892
hypnotic state as this thing morphed into a UFO

969
00:33:38.892 --> 00:33:42.253
and the lights started flashing and strobing.

970
00:33:42.253 --> 00:33:44.953
So we were having different views of the same dream

971
00:33:44.953 --> 00:33:47.573
at the same time, the same morning.

972
00:33:48.703 --> 00:33:50.511
I told Scott about it when I woke up

973
00:33:50.511 --> 00:33:52.730
and then Linda, who was staying with us woke up

974
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:55.111
and said, "I have to tell you my dream,

975
00:33:55.111 --> 00:33:56.190
there was a black helicopter,"

976
00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:57.670
I said you don't have to tell me the rest,

977
00:33:57.670 --> 00:33:59.111
I said, I understand.

978
00:33:59.111 --> 00:34:00.491
So I wrote about it and all these people

979
00:34:00.491 --> 00:34:02.291
started writing.

980
00:34:02.291 --> 00:34:06.731
<v ->Well, we do have shared dreams, or collective dreams,</v>

981
00:34:06.731 --> 00:34:08.571
or interactive dreams,

982
00:34:08.571 --> 00:34:10.931
which are not necessarily synonyms for each other.

983
00:34:10.931 --> 00:34:12.631
We do dream into the same territory,

984
00:34:12.631 --> 00:34:14.331
and we do dream into things that are important

985
00:34:14.331 --> 00:34:16.510
for our kind overall.

986
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:19.310
Dreaming is social not just individual.

987
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:21.851
We do share experiences.

988
00:34:21.851 --> 00:34:24.891
When it comes to UFOs or visitations

989
00:34:24.891 --> 00:34:26.611
from another dimension,

990
00:34:26.611 --> 00:34:28.291
we struggle for the right language to describe

991
00:34:28.291 --> 00:34:29.450
what's going on.

992
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:32.631
I mean are we talking about interdimensionals,

993
00:34:32.631 --> 00:34:34.150
are we talking about extraterrestrials,

994
00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:35.791
or are they the same thing?

995
00:34:35.791 --> 00:34:37.690
I mean I know from my own life as a dreamer

996
00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:40.831
that right now we are sitting in a four-dimensional

997
00:34:40.831 --> 00:34:42.711
universe which is part of a much vaster

998
00:34:42.711 --> 00:34:44.570
multi-dimensional universe.

999
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:48.090
How does interaction between those who are at home

1000
00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:49.470
and the other dimensions,

1001
00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:51.110
and those who are at home in these four-dimensions

1002
00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:52.750
including time, take place,

1003
00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:54.430
maybe in the way that you perceive,

1004
00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:55.831
I've been dreaming recently,

1005
00:34:55.831 --> 00:34:57.670
and I've guided people inside a dream

1006
00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:00.310
in which we are beamed up

1007
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:03.770
into space like an immense chamber of amber light.

1008
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:05.510
I've been writing about this on my blogs.

1009
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:07.331
It became very much alive when I was traveling

1010
00:35:07.331 --> 00:35:08.771
in the realm of Baltic Amber.

1011
00:35:08.771 --> 00:35:10.771
I was thinking that this space like an

1012
00:35:10.771 --> 00:35:13.050
egg-shaped amber chamber,

1013
00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:14.810
might look like a UFO to people

1014
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:16.550
who think in terms of UFOs.

1015
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:18.090
You saw it from the outside.

1016
00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:19.329
You might think of it as a UFO.

1017
00:35:19.329 --> 00:35:22.230
I don't think of it that way because I'm on the inside of it

1018
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:24.010
and for me it seems like a space in which

1019
00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:25.869
people who are at home in a higher dimension,

1020
00:35:25.869 --> 00:35:28.208
a larger dimension, receive and train

1021
00:35:28.208 --> 00:35:30.569
and educate and interact with humans

1022
00:35:30.569 --> 00:35:32.629
who are capable of rising to that level.

1023
00:35:32.629 --> 00:35:34.108
But from a different point of view it might

1024
00:35:34.108 --> 00:35:35.309
look like a UFO.

1025
00:35:35.309 --> 00:35:37.068
<v Voiceover>Yes, and it wasn't particularly ...</v>

1026
00:35:37.068 --> 00:35:39.029
I've had a lot of these where I'll,

1027
00:35:39.029 --> 00:35:40.728
something, a ball of light will come

1028
00:35:40.728 --> 00:35:42.249
and I'll have a transmission,

1029
00:35:42.249 --> 00:35:45.448
and I'm electrified and I have extra information.

1030
00:35:45.448 --> 00:35:47.489
And so it comes in a lot of different ways.

1031
00:35:47.489 --> 00:35:50.189
But what intrigued me was the symbolism,

1032
00:35:50.189 --> 00:35:52.609
the morphing, and the similarity between

1033
00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:53.988
a number of people.

1034
00:35:53.988 --> 00:35:54.928
<v ->Yes.</v>

1035
00:35:54.928 --> 00:35:56.549
Yes, well we do have mass dreams.

1036
00:35:56.549 --> 00:35:58.309
We do have collective dreams.

1037
00:35:58.309 --> 00:36:00.689
And you know, when it comes to mass events,

1038
00:36:00.689 --> 00:36:02.889
events that will effect the species or the planet,

1039
00:36:02.889 --> 00:36:04.969
they seem to cast a shadow ahead of them.

1040
00:36:04.969 --> 00:36:06.368
Many people dream into them

1041
00:36:06.368 --> 00:36:08.688
before a hurricane, before a tsunami,

1042
00:36:08.688 --> 00:36:09.768
before 9/11.

1043
00:36:09.768 --> 00:36:12.269
When the information becomes available

1044
00:36:12.269 --> 00:36:14.429
you find that hundreds and possibly thousands,

1045
00:36:14.429 --> 00:36:16.589
and possibly hundreds of thousands of people

1046
00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:18.069
have been picking up something relevant

1047
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:19.329
to that coming event.

1048
00:36:19.329 --> 00:36:21.268
Some with great specificity.

1049
00:36:21.268 --> 00:36:22.689
I mean one of my own dreamers,

1050
00:36:22.689 --> 00:36:26.828
on 9/11/2007, the dream that she,

1051
00:36:26.828 --> 00:36:29.569
with an A lead unit captured Osama Bin Ladin

1052
00:36:29.569 --> 00:36:31.568
in a compound surrounded by high walls,

1053
00:36:31.568 --> 00:36:33.388
topped by barbed wire or chicken wire.

1054
00:36:33.388 --> 00:36:35.208
It's a quite specific dream report.

1055
00:36:35.208 --> 00:36:38.949
She shared it in my presence on September the 11th 2007

1056
00:36:38.949 --> 00:36:42.348
and I have seen the journal report since.

1057
00:36:42.348 --> 00:36:44.269
So, I mean that's an example of someone

1058
00:36:44.269 --> 00:36:46.109
having apparently a precog hit,

1059
00:36:46.109 --> 00:36:48.129
four years ahead of time,

1060
00:36:48.129 --> 00:36:49.709
and actually seeing a situation

1061
00:36:49.709 --> 00:36:52.509
which it seems that US intelligence couldn't figure out.

1062
00:36:52.509 --> 00:36:53.948
As a dreamer.

1063
00:36:53.948 --> 00:36:55.268
As a dreamer with no particular interest in

1064
00:36:55.268 --> 00:36:56.509
international affairs.

1065
00:36:56.509 --> 00:36:57.728
<v Voiceover>Yes, those precognitive.</v>

1066
00:36:57.728 --> 00:37:00.109
I've had those experiences too,

1067
00:37:00.109 --> 00:37:02.089
where a shuttle's ready to blow up

1068
00:37:02.089 --> 00:37:03.629
and you dream about it just in the wee hours

1069
00:37:03.629 --> 00:37:05.308
before and that kind of thing.

1070
00:37:05.308 --> 00:37:07.229
But there's something happening, it seems

1071
00:37:07.229 --> 00:37:10.289
that there's a group called the Arlington Institute,

1072
00:37:10.289 --> 00:37:12.009
and I don't know a lot about them,

1073
00:37:12.009 --> 00:37:13.289
I've just done a little research

1074
00:37:13.289 --> 00:37:15.928
and they have project called the Weather Map

1075
00:37:15.928 --> 00:37:17.748
and they have people send in their dreams

1076
00:37:17.748 --> 00:37:19.948
and they're starting to look at collective,

1077
00:37:19.948 --> 00:37:22.429
subconscious data that's emerging

1078
00:37:22.429 --> 00:37:23.768
from the dream world,

1079
00:37:23.768 --> 00:37:26.569
actually the military does the same thing for that matter

1080
00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:28.508
in gathering intelligence.

1081
00:37:29.838 --> 00:37:34.765
To use dream time to start reaching into

1082
00:37:34.765 --> 00:37:37.986
what we may be evolving toward

1083
00:37:37.986 --> 00:37:39.945
on any number of levels,

1084
00:37:39.945 --> 00:37:41.026
what do you think of that?

1085
00:37:41.026 --> 00:37:42.245
<v ->Well all of this, I'm not going to comment</v>

1086
00:37:42.245 --> 00:37:44.786
on anybody's particular efforts,

1087
00:37:45.696 --> 00:37:48.123
I'm a person who's had a relationship

1088
00:37:48.123 --> 00:37:50.223
with the future in my dreams all my life,

1089
00:37:50.223 --> 00:37:51.264
they've saved my life.

1090
00:37:51.264 --> 00:37:53.563
I am convinced that I have avoided death

1091
00:37:53.563 --> 00:37:55.984
on the road three times by working with dreams

1092
00:37:55.984 --> 00:37:58.803
that showed me a possibly fatal situation.

1093
00:37:58.803 --> 00:38:01.404
I've worked with literally thousands

1094
00:38:01.404 --> 00:38:03.084
of precognitive dreamers.

1095
00:38:03.084 --> 00:38:05.784
To learn that not only do we see the future

1096
00:38:05.784 --> 00:38:07.664
in our dreams, but that they future we see

1097
00:38:07.664 --> 00:38:09.143
is a possible future,

1098
00:38:09.143 --> 00:38:11.903
and we can change the outcome if we can read the information

1099
00:38:11.903 --> 00:38:13.923
correctly and take action.

1100
00:38:13.923 --> 00:38:16.743
Whether by some sort of sampling of the sort of

1101
00:38:16.743 --> 00:38:19.643
the dream stream from thousands or millions

1102
00:38:19.643 --> 00:38:20.223
of people.

1103
00:38:20.223 --> 00:38:22.124
Whether you get information would be actually

1104
00:38:22.124 --> 00:38:24.624
of practical value to anybody, I don't know.

1105
00:38:24.624 --> 00:38:27.143
Yet I have said, that mass events cast a shadow

1106
00:38:27.143 --> 00:38:28.703
before them so it's possible that you would

1107
00:38:28.703 --> 00:38:29.924
get something out of it.

1108
00:38:29.924 --> 00:38:31.803
Probably the best information is going to come

1109
00:38:31.803 --> 00:38:34.523
from dreamers who are particularly good at what they do.

1110
00:38:34.523 --> 00:38:37.044
And we're valued in the history of our kind

1111
00:38:37.044 --> 00:38:39.663
because, you know, you look to the right dreamer

1112
00:38:39.663 --> 00:38:41.743
to show you, in an indigenous culture

1113
00:38:41.743 --> 00:38:43.723
where you got the food when you were starving.

1114
00:38:43.723 --> 00:38:44.503
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1115
00:38:44.503 --> 00:38:46.083
<v ->There's an example of this which I wrote about</v>

1116
00:38:46.083 --> 00:38:47.604
in My Secret History of Dreaming

1117
00:38:47.604 --> 00:38:48.703
from the Andaman Islands

1118
00:38:48.703 --> 00:38:51.643
during the Asian tsunami of 2004.

1119
00:38:51.643 --> 00:38:54.844
That tsunami killed 165,000 people

1120
00:38:54.844 --> 00:38:56.523
around the Indian Ocean.

1121
00:38:56.523 --> 00:38:58.564
And there's a group of people in the Andaman Islands

1122
00:38:58.564 --> 00:39:01.503
which claimed by the Indian government,

1123
00:39:01.503 --> 00:39:03.904
who, in December of 2004 were in their

1124
00:39:03.904 --> 00:39:05.244
coastal fishing settlements.

1125
00:39:05.244 --> 00:39:07.283
They hunter-gatherer fishing people.

1126
00:39:07.283 --> 00:39:10.924
They're also shamanic dreaming people, the Andamanese.

1127
00:39:10.924 --> 00:39:14.083
And after the tsunami, all their coastal fishing villages

1128
00:39:14.083 --> 00:39:14.983
had gone.

1129
00:39:14.983 --> 00:39:16.623
The Indian government assumed they'd all been

1130
00:39:16.623 --> 00:39:18.723
swept away by the giant wave.

1131
00:39:18.723 --> 00:39:20.623
Two weeks later, when an Indian chopper

1132
00:39:20.623 --> 00:39:22.823
was over flying the high country.

1133
00:39:22.823 --> 00:39:24.743
An Andamanese came out with a bow and arrow

1134
00:39:24.743 --> 00:39:26.583
and fired at the chopper saying go away,

1135
00:39:26.583 --> 00:39:28.444
we didn't need you then we don't need you now.

1136
00:39:28.444 --> 00:39:30.663
And they realized, the Andamanese had escaped

1137
00:39:30.663 --> 00:39:33.063
the tsunami because they knew it was coming.

1138
00:39:33.063 --> 00:39:34.163
They got out of the villages,

1139
00:39:34.163 --> 00:39:35.424
they went up to the high country

1140
00:39:35.424 --> 00:39:36.663
and they knew for two reasons.

1141
00:39:36.663 --> 00:39:38.644
This is very relevant to all of us,

1142
00:39:38.644 --> 00:39:39.804
Shamanic dreaming people,

1143
00:39:39.804 --> 00:39:40.984
they have a lesson for all of us.

1144
00:39:40.984 --> 00:39:43.284
Number one, they live close to nature.

1145
00:39:43.284 --> 00:39:45.063
They follow the patterns of wind and wave,

1146
00:39:45.063 --> 00:39:46.924
they follow the behavior of birds and animals

1147
00:39:46.924 --> 00:39:48.344
and they know things that way.

1148
00:39:48.344 --> 00:39:50.323
Secondly, they have a process of communal,

1149
00:39:50.323 --> 00:39:51.404
collective dreaming.

1150
00:39:51.404 --> 00:39:53.663
They get together in their big houses

1151
00:39:53.663 --> 00:39:55.684
to dream on, often survival matters.

1152
00:39:55.684 --> 00:39:57.124
Where do we find the fish?

1153
00:39:57.124 --> 00:39:58.763
Where do we find the food?

1154
00:39:58.763 --> 00:40:00.183
What is going to happen next?

1155
00:40:00.183 --> 00:40:02.563
They picture themselves growing a kind of web

1156
00:40:02.563 --> 00:40:04.584
of dreaming and they state their intentions

1157
00:40:04.584 --> 00:40:06.663
and as they enter the dreamspace,

1158
00:40:06.663 --> 00:40:09.363
they picture themselves going out across the web of dream

1159
00:40:09.363 --> 00:40:11.764
and dreaming then taking off one by one

1160
00:40:11.764 --> 00:40:12.904
and see what they need to see

1161
00:40:12.904 --> 00:40:14.984
and bringing back the results for their people.

1162
00:40:14.984 --> 00:40:16.644
I'm starting to teach processes

1163
00:40:16.644 --> 00:40:18.404
of conscious group dreaming of this kind

1164
00:40:18.404 --> 00:40:20.324
in which we've got a whole circle of people together,

1165
00:40:20.324 --> 00:40:21.944
we agree on our objective,

1166
00:40:21.944 --> 00:40:25.024
and we go out to dream together for a common purpose

1167
00:40:25.024 --> 00:40:25.824
in this way.

1168
00:40:25.824 --> 00:40:28.064
I think this is a skill we need to build in culture.

1169
00:40:28.064 --> 00:40:29.764
<v Voiceover>I was just going to ask you about that</v>

1170
00:40:29.764 --> 00:40:31.424
as a follow up, absolutely.

1171
00:40:31.424 --> 00:40:32.204
So you're already,

1172
00:40:32.204 --> 00:40:33.803
you have this in the works now.

1173
00:40:33.803 --> 00:40:34.683
<v ->We're doing it.</v>

1174
00:40:34.683 --> 00:40:35.943
<v Voiceover>You are?</v>

1175
00:40:35.943 --> 00:40:37.683
<v ->I mean I'm doing it typically in groups</v>

1176
00:40:37.683 --> 00:40:40.324
of 30 or 40 people in my workshops.

1177
00:40:40.324 --> 00:40:41.783
The results are extraordinary.

1178
00:40:41.783 --> 00:40:43.123
I mean I wrote about ...

1179
00:40:43.123 --> 00:40:45.624
There are guidelines for doing this in the new book,

1180
00:40:45.624 --> 00:40:46.584
in Active Dreaming.

1181
00:40:46.584 --> 00:40:49.684
I've written in more detail about specific experiences

1182
00:40:49.684 --> 00:40:51.263
of doing it in other books,

1183
00:40:51.263 --> 00:40:54.443
including one called Dreamers of the Iroquois.

1184
00:40:54.443 --> 00:40:57.643
<v Voiceover>Okay, well so, if you don't mind my asking,</v>

1185
00:40:57.643 --> 00:41:00.104
if it's not invasive, since you have been dreaming,

1186
00:41:00.104 --> 00:41:03.683
not lucidly, consciously, your entire life,

1187
00:41:03.683 --> 00:41:05.963
or it sounds like your entire life,

1188
00:41:05.963 --> 00:41:08.744
and you have had your own glimpses into

1189
00:41:08.744 --> 00:41:11.703
the future, as you say, which can be changed.

1190
00:41:11.703 --> 00:41:14.404
If we understand the processes.

1191
00:41:14.404 --> 00:41:16.883
Can you talk a little bit about what you see?

1192
00:41:16.883 --> 00:41:19.043
What do you see for humanity?

1193
00:41:19.043 --> 00:41:20.823
<v ->What is the most important for me is actually</v>

1194
00:41:20.823 --> 00:41:22.703
reflected in the last pages of the book

1195
00:41:22.703 --> 00:41:24.824
Active Dreaming which are a change of style

1196
00:41:24.824 --> 00:41:25.883
and a change of content,

1197
00:41:25.883 --> 00:41:28.244
they are documents from a possible future.

1198
00:41:28.244 --> 00:41:29.643
They are documents from a commonwealth

1199
00:41:29.643 --> 00:41:33.644
of dreamers, maybe seven generations beyond our time.

1200
00:41:33.644 --> 00:41:36.204
Which are supported by the world community

1201
00:41:36.204 --> 00:41:38.304
as a sort of Switzerland of the mind

1202
00:41:38.304 --> 00:41:40.844
because the values of dreaming are now considered

1203
00:41:40.844 --> 00:41:43.844
to be absolutely central to medicine, to education,

1204
00:41:43.844 --> 00:41:46.584
to seeing the future, to healing the planet.

1205
00:41:46.584 --> 00:41:48.964
In that future society as I have seen it,

1206
00:41:48.964 --> 00:41:50.944
I'm talking beyond the book now

1207
00:41:50.944 --> 00:41:52.683
there is a young woman who is a priestess

1208
00:41:52.683 --> 00:41:54.464
and scientist at the same time,

1209
00:41:54.464 --> 00:41:56.983
and a dreamer central to her practice is dreaming.

1210
00:41:56.983 --> 00:41:58.624
And she is one of an order of women who are trying to

1211
00:41:58.624 --> 00:42:00.244
repair this world,

1212
00:42:00.244 --> 00:42:02.604
and dreaming is absolutely central to their practice.

1213
00:42:02.604 --> 00:42:04.444
Around her is a world that is somewhat different

1214
00:42:04.444 --> 00:42:05.764
from ours.

1215
00:42:05.764 --> 00:42:07.903
Some bad things have happened.

1216
00:42:07.903 --> 00:42:09.924
Some further changes in human evolution

1217
00:42:09.924 --> 00:42:13.144
have taken place at a galloping rate,

1218
00:42:13.144 --> 00:42:14.523
which are going to be quite astonishing

1219
00:42:14.523 --> 00:42:16.284
in terms of what we can physically do.

1220
00:42:16.284 --> 00:42:18.224
<v Voiceover>I'm getting chills in my hair,</v>

1221
00:42:18.224 --> 00:42:20.264
down to my toes as you speak.

1222
00:42:20.264 --> 00:42:23.683
<v ->We are actually becoming an amphibious people again.</v>

1223
00:42:23.683 --> 00:42:25.644
The intent of our physical evolution.

1224
00:42:25.644 --> 00:42:27.284
This is accelerated by technology

1225
00:42:27.284 --> 00:42:29.183
as well as other things.

1226
00:42:29.183 --> 00:42:32.443
But the key thing is not the world context,

1227
00:42:32.443 --> 00:42:34.184
not the world disasters that have happened

1228
00:42:34.184 --> 00:42:35.144
between now and then.

1229
00:42:35.144 --> 00:42:37.264
It is that this woman is possible.

1230
00:42:37.264 --> 00:42:39.444
That dreaming as I understand it is central

1231
00:42:39.444 --> 00:42:40.844
to her practice and that of her order.

1232
00:42:40.844 --> 00:42:42.284
And in my own work,

1233
00:42:42.284 --> 00:42:44.703
I feel a huge obligation, responsibility

1234
00:42:44.703 --> 00:42:46.424
to make her possible.

1235
00:42:46.424 --> 00:42:49.903
That's one of the engines of my work.

1236
00:42:49.903 --> 00:42:51.424
<v Voiceover>On that note.</v>

1237
00:42:51.424 --> 00:42:52.684
That beautiful note,

1238
00:42:52.684 --> 00:42:54.584
thank you so much for your time Robert.

1239
00:42:54.584 --> 00:42:57.143
I've very much been looking forward to meeting with you.

1240
00:42:57.143 --> 00:43:01.643
I understand the beauty and value, and possibility

1241
00:43:01.643 --> 00:43:05.083
of dreams myself even though I haven't fully explored them

1242
00:43:05.083 --> 00:43:08.884
and you've shed a great amount of light on it for us today.

1243
00:43:08.884 --> 00:43:10.024
<v ->It's a pleasure Regina,</v>

1244
00:43:10.024 --> 00:43:11.564
and may your best dreams come true.

1245
00:43:11.564 --> 00:43:13.133
<v Voiceover>Thank you.</v>

1246
00:43:14.404 --> 00:43:16.564
<v ->Sounds like it's time to pick up a dream journal.</v>

1247
00:43:16.564 --> 00:43:19.083
Maybe one for nighttime and one for daytime.

1248
00:43:19.083 --> 00:43:20.804
I've found over my adult life that virtually

1249
00:43:20.804 --> 00:43:22.584
everything I've ever created in life

1250
00:43:22.584 --> 00:43:24.964
has first been daydreamed repeatedly.

1251
00:43:24.964 --> 00:43:26.743
And I can say, it works.

1252
00:43:26.743 --> 00:43:28.004
As for the nighttime,

1253
00:43:28.004 --> 00:43:30.063
we all need to be paying close attention

1254
00:43:30.063 --> 00:43:32.724
as our soul attempts to speak to us.

1255
00:43:32.724 --> 00:43:35.313
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
