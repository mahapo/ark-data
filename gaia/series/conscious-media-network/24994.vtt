00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:03.649
<v ->In looking through our current human condition,</v>

2
00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:06.469
to a future more steeped in love and compassion,

3
00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:08.409
we cannot discount the importance of how

4
00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:10.529
we bring our children into the world.

5
00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:12.649
In this conversation with Sai Maa,

6
00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:14.969
we discuss how we prepare for conception,

7
00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.209
the birth of a child, and how we begin

8
00:00:17.209 --> 00:00:20.169
to prepare children for their lives as sexual beings.

9
00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:22.524
But first, we must understand the nature

10
00:00:22.524 --> 00:00:24.181
of the infant soul force.

11
00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:26.751
(light tranquil music)

12
00:00:35.422 --> 00:00:37.972
<v Voiceover>Sai Maa, welcome.</v>

13
00:00:37.972 --> 00:00:41.741
<v ->Thank you. (speaks foreign language)</v>

14
00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:46.141
It's a great gift to all of us be together.

15
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:48.034
And great blessings with great love

16
00:00:48.034 --> 00:00:50.743
to all of you. (speaks foreign language)

17
00:00:53.773 --> 00:00:55.433
<v Voiceover>I would like to talk to you</v>

18
00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:58.093
about the children in the sense of

19
00:00:58.093 --> 00:01:01.033
our raising our children in a new way

20
00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:03.513
to correspond with the new light

21
00:01:03.513 --> 00:01:06.033
coming into the planet, with the new possibility

22
00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:08.373
for human evolution at this time.

23
00:01:08.373 --> 00:01:10.232
Yet, we still raise our children in

24
00:01:10.232 --> 00:01:14.565
an unconscious way that no longer works.

25
00:01:14.565 --> 00:01:18.466
Can you start wherever you feel is most important

26
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:22.269
with what's important at this time and what's important

27
00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:25.569
as parents when we look at educating our children?

28
00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:29.389
<v ->Absolutely. It's a great question and it's a question</v>

29
00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:33.829
that all parents right now are to be aware of.

30
00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.789
First, I will suggest that whoever wish

31
00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.230
to carry a child, prepare themself.

32
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.990
Prepare their consciousness, prepare their body,

33
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.950
as these coming children are different frequencies.

34
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.050
They are bringing a different frequency in their DNA.

35
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.070
They come with a rememberence of who they are.

36
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.130
They may just say, at the age of one

37
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.096
or one and a half or two, "I am God."

38
00:01:59.096 --> 00:02:01.376
What do the parents do with that?

39
00:02:01.376 --> 00:02:03.956
So, to be able to carry a child right now

40
00:02:03.956 --> 00:02:07.136
and to be able to educate a child right now,

41
00:02:07.136 --> 00:02:10.652
one is to be in a different consciousness,

42
00:02:10.652 --> 00:02:13.891
one has to really be on a spiritual path.

43
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:16.911
As these children are coming with the essence

44
00:02:16.911 --> 00:02:21.883
of spirit in the body, they manifest,

45
00:02:21.883 --> 00:02:26.245
they manifest the, what we read in scriptures

46
00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:28.765
into their everyday life.

47
00:02:28.765 --> 00:02:30.659
The school doesn't fit them anymore,

48
00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.559
the old pattern, the old system.

49
00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:35.179
Every children, for instance, children

50
00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:38.419
are ready to say, and will ask their parents right now,

51
00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:41.939
"So you say God. What is God? Who is God?"

52
00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.919
What can the parents answer?

53
00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.879
So, the first thing is to for all parents

54
00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.807
to realize that they are energy.

55
00:02:54.457 --> 00:02:58.877
God is energy. Everything is about energy.

56
00:02:58.877 --> 00:03:02.377
Do we raise its frequency, do we lower it frequency?

57
00:03:02.377 --> 00:03:04.344
It's all about energy.

58
00:03:06.356 --> 00:03:10.669
And I will say, do not see a small child,

59
00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:13.051
physical body size

60
00:03:15.504 --> 00:03:18.169
as an uneducated

61
00:03:20.798 --> 00:03:25.297
human being, but see an evolved soul

62
00:03:25.297 --> 00:03:27.969
into a physical body.

63
00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:32.769
Meaning, don't baby them as most people do.

64
00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.249
They have a great maturity, probably

65
00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:39.649
sometime more than the parents.

66
00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:42.288
<v Voiceover>Very true. And let me ask this,</v>

67
00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:46.688
almost conversely, which is, if a parent chooses

68
00:03:46.688 --> 00:03:48.868
to develop their consciousness, and we'll talk about

69
00:03:48.868 --> 00:03:51.867
some of the preparation that you would recommend also.

70
00:03:51.867 --> 00:03:53.987
If they choose to prepare themselves and bring

71
00:03:53.987 --> 00:03:58.047
this consciousness forward in preparation of conception,

72
00:03:58.047 --> 00:04:02.327
would it be fair to say that that is a desirable mother

73
00:04:02.327 --> 00:04:06.207
and father for a being of this nature to come through?

74
00:04:06.207 --> 00:04:09.305
That these beings who are choosing to incarnate

75
00:04:09.305 --> 00:04:12.825
will choose a more conscious possibility?

76
00:04:12.825 --> 00:04:14.205
Is that fair to say? Or were--

77
00:04:14.205 --> 00:04:15.545
<v ->Sure, sure.
<v Voiceover>I mean, rather</v>

78
00:04:15.545 --> 00:04:16.761
than just trying to pop through

79
00:04:16.761 --> 00:04:19.317
any circumstance that doesn't support this?

80
00:04:19.317 --> 00:04:21.017
<v ->This is a very important point,</v>

81
00:04:21.017 --> 00:04:24.915
as most women that I've come across,

82
00:04:24.915 --> 00:04:27.835
mostly in the west, they want a child.

83
00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:30.335
It's not about creating a consciousness.

84
00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:32.595
"I want a child, I don't want to be alone anymore,

85
00:04:32.595 --> 00:04:34.955
and I know I won't be married."

86
00:04:34.955 --> 00:04:38.332
It's not about wanting a child.

87
00:04:38.332 --> 00:04:42.892
Stop the wanting, create, co-create.

88
00:04:42.892 --> 00:04:45.432
And it's such an important thing for a child

89
00:04:45.432 --> 00:04:49.909
to have both, both parents there, role models.

90
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:53.089
And for that, the mother or the father or the bearer

91
00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:57.069
of the child, has to really be in a different consciousness.

92
00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:58.269
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about how</v>

93
00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:03.117
one prepares themselves for conscious conception.

94
00:05:03.117 --> 00:05:05.884
<v ->First, the physical body.</v>

95
00:05:05.884 --> 00:05:08.884
Make sure the body is not a weak body.

96
00:05:08.884 --> 00:05:10.564
Make sure it's a strong body.

97
00:05:10.564 --> 00:05:15.064
Eat consciously, eat alive food,

98
00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:19.823
listen to sound that uplift the body's cells,

99
00:05:19.823 --> 00:05:23.463
memories, lift the blood cells,

100
00:05:23.463 --> 00:05:25.402
make sure that the liver, the uterus,

101
00:05:25.402 --> 00:05:29.162
the ovaries are healthy, meaning a healthy body.

102
00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.782
Then, be aware of the mind.

103
00:05:30.782 --> 00:05:32.322
What kind of thoughts do I have?

104
00:05:32.322 --> 00:05:35.162
Am I still afraid, am I still in my own

105
00:05:35.162 --> 00:05:37.522
umbilical cord with my own mother

106
00:05:37.522 --> 00:05:41.622
with all the mothers of my mother?

107
00:05:41.622 --> 00:05:44.439
And that I'm not connecting with the store room

108
00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:47.138
of my grand great mother, mother.

109
00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:49.758
Bringing that to the cord for the child,

110
00:05:49.758 --> 00:05:53.778
the embryo let's say, not the child but the embryo.

111
00:05:53.778 --> 00:05:57.671
Go to that place where we release any fear

112
00:05:57.671 --> 00:06:01.959
that comes up because whatever

113
00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:06.853
is inside of us is connected with our own energy.

114
00:06:06.853 --> 00:06:09.512
So, do we wish to pull the fear of our mother,

115
00:06:09.512 --> 00:06:13.192
grandmother, great-grandmother in ourself

116
00:06:13.192 --> 00:06:15.632
and go into the embryo, or do we choose

117
00:06:15.632 --> 00:06:18.852
to be more free and give a different energy

118
00:06:18.852 --> 00:06:22.252
and create a different energy when this consciousness

119
00:06:22.252 --> 00:06:26.502
enter our womb,

120
00:06:26.502 --> 00:06:28.132
so to say.

121
00:06:28.142 --> 00:06:29.642
<v Voiceover>And we'll assume that</v>

122
00:06:29.642 --> 00:06:31.442
during the process of gestation,

123
00:06:31.442 --> 00:06:33.142
the same principles apply.
<v ->Same!</v>

124
00:06:33.142 --> 00:06:34.122
<v Voiceover>So, it's the same.</v>

125
00:06:34.122 --> 00:06:36.939
And now this being has made its entrance

126
00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:39.799
into the world and we tend to think of this,

127
00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:41.699
"Of course this being can't do much

128
00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:43.538
"to support themselves at this time."

129
00:06:43.538 --> 00:06:46.838
But, how do you begin relating to the baby

130
00:06:46.838 --> 00:06:49.118
from this point forward, once it's into the world?

131
00:06:49.118 --> 00:06:52.397
<v ->First, realize when it's in the womb,</v>

132
00:06:52.397 --> 00:06:55.897
it's not your child, it's not a possession,

133
00:06:55.897 --> 00:06:57.816
doesn't belongs to you.

134
00:06:57.816 --> 00:07:02.156
You have no control over that energy.

135
00:07:02.156 --> 00:07:04.098
This energy belongs to the creation.

136
00:07:04.098 --> 00:07:08.378
You're here as a custodian to support the energy

137
00:07:08.378 --> 00:07:11.918
to do this, to blossom, to be mature.

138
00:07:11.918 --> 00:07:15.898
That's a very important word and energy, to be mature,

139
00:07:15.898 --> 00:07:20.878
because most babies in this country are creating babies,

140
00:07:20.878 --> 00:07:22.633
so maturity is lacking.

141
00:07:22.633 --> 00:07:23.491
<v Voiceover>And you can be a baby</v>

142
00:07:23.491 --> 00:07:25.711
creating a baby even if you're 40 years old.

143
00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:28.031
<v ->Absolutely, if there's no maturity.</v>

144
00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:32.311
So, maturity is very important and take responsibilities.

145
00:07:32.311 --> 00:07:35.491
So, be clear, be clean, I will even suggest now,

146
00:07:35.491 --> 00:07:38.831
I just read an article recently from Sweden

147
00:07:38.831 --> 00:07:43.331
about how in America many, mostly girls and women,

148
00:07:43.331 --> 00:07:45.411
and they talk of a girl of nine years old,

149
00:07:45.411 --> 00:07:50.399
who are having big breasts, due to animal hormones

150
00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:53.125
in the meat, in the eggs, in the chicken

151
00:07:53.125 --> 00:07:53.664
and now in
<v Voiceover>Dairy.</v>

152
00:07:53.664 --> 00:07:56.544
<v ->private fish, and in dairy.</v>

153
00:07:56.544 --> 00:07:59.036
So, to be aware not to bring these

154
00:07:59.036 --> 00:08:03.396
animal, these artificial hormones in the body.

155
00:08:03.396 --> 00:08:06.776
And again, see this is as a creator

156
00:08:06.776 --> 00:08:09.290
that you created, but doesn't belongs to you.

157
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.549
That's mostly important, no possessiveness.

158
00:08:12.549 --> 00:08:14.129
<v Voiceover>Now, the child has,</v>

159
00:08:14.129 --> 00:08:16.829
you've done a good job and through the years,

160
00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:18.809
it's been exposed to all the proper influences

161
00:08:18.809 --> 00:08:21.209
and now reaches school age and we have

162
00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:24.207
a completely decrepit school
<v Sai Maa>Verbal.</v>

163
00:08:24.207 --> 00:08:28.045
<v Voiceover>system. So now, what do we do</v>

164
00:08:28.045 --> 00:08:29.244
with our children?
<v Sai Maa>Before even we go</v>

165
00:08:29.244 --> 00:08:29.977
to the school place--

166
00:08:29.977 --> 00:08:30.936
<v Voiceover>And let's assume we're talking</v>

167
00:08:30.936 --> 00:08:32.796
about these children that have already come in--

168
00:08:32.796 --> 00:08:33.496
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

169
00:08:33.496 --> 00:08:34.033
<v Voiceover>with awareness.</v>

170
00:08:34.033 --> 00:08:38.087
<v ->Absolutely. Now, most children will have</v>

171
00:08:38.087 --> 00:08:40.287
a higher frequency consciousness

172
00:08:40.287 --> 00:08:43.147
than their parents, 99%.

173
00:08:43.147 --> 00:08:46.627
Before going to school, I will really say

174
00:08:46.627 --> 00:08:49.387
an emphasis on that the parents

175
00:08:49.387 --> 00:08:52.432
in our culture it says our parents are our gurus.

176
00:08:54.522 --> 00:08:59.123
Educate the children at home before they go to school.

177
00:08:59.123 --> 00:09:03.941
Learn, parents are to learn how to communicate with children

178
00:09:03.941 --> 00:09:06.780
because most children, what I found out mostly

179
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:11.640
when I was a therapist, is they express themself.

180
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.972
"Do this, do that, don't do this, don't do that."

181
00:09:13.972 --> 00:09:18.732
Uh-uh. "I request you to do this."

182
00:09:18.732 --> 00:09:21.312
The child hear, "Oh."

183
00:09:21.312 --> 00:09:24.472
And most parents has a tendency to say

184
00:09:24.472 --> 00:09:27.765
to their children, "Mom is coming back.

185
00:09:27.765 --> 00:09:32.345
"Dad is coming back," while talking of themself.

186
00:09:32.345 --> 00:09:35.665
Do not talk to a child in the third person.

187
00:09:35.665 --> 00:09:38.605
Direct communication.

188
00:09:38.605 --> 00:09:42.505
"I am leaving for work. I'll take you to school

189
00:09:42.505 --> 00:09:46.285
"and whoever, or myself, will come and get you."

190
00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:48.804
Communication is a big thing.

191
00:09:48.804 --> 00:09:51.084
<v Voiceover>What about the actual</v>

192
00:09:51.084 --> 00:09:53.664
systems themselves, because the school systems

193
00:09:53.664 --> 00:09:55.384
no longer support creativity and--

194
00:09:55.384 --> 00:09:56.544
<v ->We all know that.</v>

195
00:09:56.544 --> 00:09:58.662
<v Voiceover>So now, what are,</v>

196
00:09:58.662 --> 00:10:01.022
let's look at some of the alternatives

197
00:10:01.022 --> 00:10:03.322
that you have seen or witnessed--

198
00:10:03.322 --> 00:10:04.542
<v ->And, which work?</v>

199
00:10:04.542 --> 00:10:05.462
<v Voiceover>And that work.</v>

200
00:10:05.462 --> 00:10:09.680
<v ->Yes. In Europe, in Canada, and some schools here,</v>

201
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.319
they are private, unfortunately,

202
00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:14.539
so people has to be able to afford this

203
00:10:14.539 --> 00:10:18.179
this place to go to school,

204
00:10:18.179 --> 00:10:21.539
it creativity at a whole level.

205
00:10:21.539 --> 00:10:24.796
Look at the child with the spirit of the child, not only

206
00:10:24.796 --> 00:10:29.435
the intellect, not only one half of the brain,

207
00:10:29.435 --> 00:10:32.749
but a balance with both brain, the emotional

208
00:10:32.749 --> 00:10:37.579
energy, creativity, tenderness, sweetness,

209
00:10:37.579 --> 00:10:41.529
love, with the intellect, built both.

210
00:10:43.861 --> 00:10:46.186
<v Voiceover>And what about the notion</v>

211
00:10:46.186 --> 00:10:50.526
of homeschooling, of bypassing the systems all together?

212
00:10:50.526 --> 00:10:54.586
<v ->I found out that parents who homeschool</v>

213
00:10:54.586 --> 00:10:57.866
their own children, it's very difficult

214
00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:00.805
for the mother to keep the discipline.

215
00:11:00.805 --> 00:11:04.004
The phone rings, the mother goes and answer the phone,

216
00:11:04.004 --> 00:11:07.444
something happen, the grandmother call, there's an issue.

217
00:11:07.444 --> 00:11:09.483
The child go through all of this.

218
00:11:09.483 --> 00:11:12.163
I agree with homeschool.

219
00:11:12.163 --> 00:11:16.203
In Montreal, what I worked with was

220
00:11:16.203 --> 00:11:20.023
bring different mothers and hire teachers

221
00:11:20.023 --> 00:11:22.223
from outside to come to one place

222
00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:24.663
where all the children go together.

223
00:11:24.663 --> 00:11:27.382
Not just direct mother at home

224
00:11:27.382 --> 00:11:28.902
because there's no discipline.

225
00:11:28.902 --> 00:11:32.642
You get up and we start school at 10.

226
00:11:32.642 --> 00:11:36.942
99% of the mothers, it's hard for them to do this.

227
00:11:36.942 --> 00:11:39.582
<v Voiceover>Right. Well this makes sense, though.</v>

228
00:11:39.582 --> 00:11:41.822
To have collectives where you have

229
00:11:41.822 --> 00:11:44.422
a collective of mothers and a home large enough

230
00:11:44.422 --> 00:11:46.180
to take maybe eight or ten children together.

231
00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.778
<v ->Yes, yes, yes, and hire outsiders.</v>

232
00:11:48.778 --> 00:11:49.898
<v Voiceover>And hire outsiders.</v>

233
00:11:49.898 --> 00:11:52.767
<v ->Who, and it can be somebody who is not a mother</v>

234
00:11:52.767 --> 00:11:55.675
because discipline is number one to get

235
00:11:55.675 --> 00:11:59.335
a mature human being and mothers

236
00:11:59.335 --> 00:12:02.455
are very, it's very difficult for mothers to give

237
00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:04.955
discipline to their own children with timing.

238
00:12:04.955 --> 00:12:06.795
"We finish at 12:30, have lunch,

239
00:12:06.795 --> 00:12:09.335
have a little nap, and start school again."

240
00:12:09.335 --> 00:12:12.615
<v Voiceover>Yes, it is. And even so,</v>

241
00:12:12.615 --> 00:12:14.615
mothers are perfectly capable of teaching

242
00:12:14.615 --> 00:12:17.755
a good number of subjects, along with their children,

243
00:12:17.755 --> 00:12:20.375
if they choose to and can create the discipline.

244
00:12:20.375 --> 00:12:23.714
But as you say, perhaps to collectively pay

245
00:12:23.714 --> 00:12:25.994
to bring in an outsider to do these

246
00:12:25.994 --> 00:12:26.992
lessons.
<v ->And a teacher.</v>

247
00:12:26.992 --> 00:12:28.407
<v Voiceover>And a teacher, yes, exactly.</v>

248
00:12:28.407 --> 00:12:30.386
<v ->Who is into science, who is into computer,</v>

249
00:12:30.386 --> 00:12:33.461
who is into medical, who is into organs of the body,

250
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:35.261
which mothers, many mothers don't know.

251
00:12:35.261 --> 00:12:36.461
<v Voiceover>That is true.</v>

252
00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:38.201
<v ->History, you know.</v>

253
00:12:38.201 --> 00:12:40.980
<v Voiceover>Now, let's look at the subjects</v>

254
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:45.120
beyond the classics and let's look at the

255
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.760
art of painting, of dancing, of music, and these things.

256
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.998
<v ->All this is possible, start at a young age</v>

257
00:12:51.998 --> 00:12:54.598
and give a variety to all the children.

258
00:12:54.598 --> 00:12:55.978
<v Voiceover>And let them, perhaps,</v>

259
00:12:55.978 --> 00:12:58.698
demonstrate what their interests are,

260
00:12:58.698 --> 00:13:01.598
and then start following them and creating

261
00:13:01.598 --> 00:13:04.996
for them, with them, co-creating their education.

262
00:13:04.996 --> 00:13:06.896
It makes more sense, yes.

263
00:13:06.896 --> 00:13:09.276
Okay, now the children have made it through

264
00:13:09.276 --> 00:13:11.776
those early years and they're in their pubescent times

265
00:13:11.776 --> 00:13:14.156
and now they're going into the early teens,

266
00:13:14.156 --> 00:13:16.776
and we're starting to look at the sexuality.

267
00:13:16.776 --> 00:13:19.696
In our culture today, one of the greatest

268
00:13:19.696 --> 00:13:23.575
phenomenons happening, shockingly,

269
00:13:23.575 --> 00:13:26.815
is for high school graduation, parents are giving

270
00:13:26.815 --> 00:13:30.055
their daughters the elective surgery of breast augmentation.

271
00:13:30.055 --> 00:13:31.415
<v ->Oh, please don't take me there.</v>

272
00:13:31.415 --> 00:13:32.793
<v Voiceover>No, I'm taking you there. (giggles)</v>

273
00:13:32.793 --> 00:13:36.323
<v ->No, no. We cancel this, that is for me, no.</v>

274
00:13:36.323 --> 00:13:37.229
<v Voiceover>But this is--</v>

275
00:13:37.229 --> 00:13:40.168
<v ->I'm not going to go to that. Leave it, please.</v>

276
00:13:40.168 --> 00:13:41.660
<v Voiceover>(giggles) We don't have to go into that.</v>

277
00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.720
I'm bringing that up because I think we feel the same way.

278
00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.799
This is beyond unconscionable that this

279
00:13:48.799 --> 00:13:50.876
is how we're to present ourselves to the world.

280
00:13:50.876 --> 00:13:52.075
<v ->It's all about sex in this country.</v>

281
00:13:52.075 --> 00:13:53.094
<v Voiceover>It's all about sex.</v>

282
00:13:53.094 --> 00:13:55.153
<v ->It's all about the body, so I'm not</v>

283
00:13:55.153 --> 00:13:56.773
going to go into that with you.

284
00:13:56.773 --> 00:13:57.473
<v Voiceover>So, let's go--</v>

285
00:13:57.473 --> 00:13:59.032
<v ->And recently, I'll tell you what I heard</v>

286
00:13:59.032 --> 00:14:03.012
that really bring a terrible energy into me.

287
00:14:03.012 --> 00:14:05.032
Doctors of this country, I don't know whether

288
00:14:05.032 --> 00:14:07.672
you're aware of that doctors of this country

289
00:14:07.672 --> 00:14:11.452
are saying, "Well, when we see a child, a boy child,

290
00:14:11.452 --> 00:14:15.812
"want to wear a dress, want to wear like girl's things?

291
00:14:15.812 --> 00:14:17.272
"We have to take them to the doctor

292
00:14:17.272 --> 00:14:20.990
"and have organ surgery."

293
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:22.090
<v Voiceover>You are kidding.</v>

294
00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.330
<v ->I mean, and we're talking
<v Voiceover>I have not heard</v>

295
00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:24.950
<v ->of five years old.
<v Voiceover>that one.</v>

296
00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:26.850
<v ->We're talking of six years old.</v>

297
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.559
When I read this, and then they even gave

298
00:14:29.559 --> 00:14:32.279
the information in the news on the TV,

299
00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:34.417
I went on that on the internet,

300
00:14:34.417 --> 00:14:36.177
it just, I want to throw up.

301
00:14:36.177 --> 00:14:37.107
<v Voiceover>I've never heard that part.</v>

302
00:14:37.107 --> 00:14:37.695
That is--

303
00:14:37.695 --> 00:14:42.046
<v ->I want to throw up and that may become a law!</v>

304
00:14:42.046 --> 00:14:43.288
So, please don't take me there.

305
00:14:43.288 --> 00:14:44.311
<v Voiceover>So, to get you going on that,</v>

306
00:14:44.311 --> 00:14:46.341
I can see we would go on for hours,

307
00:14:46.341 --> 00:14:48.172
so let, we don't need to go there.

308
00:14:48.172 --> 00:14:50.232
But where I want to go is the opposite.

309
00:14:50.232 --> 00:14:52.092
We can see what the problems are.

310
00:14:52.092 --> 00:14:54.592
Little girls wearing little provocative clothing,

311
00:14:54.592 --> 00:14:56.932
going out and thinking that this package,

312
00:14:56.932 --> 00:15:00.452
this gift wrap they're in, is who they are.

313
00:15:00.452 --> 00:15:04.032
Now, let's talk about how we educate

314
00:15:04.032 --> 00:15:06.872
the children properly to enter the world

315
00:15:06.872 --> 00:15:09.572
so they're whole human beings, whole young women,

316
00:15:09.572 --> 00:15:11.972
offering an entire holistic being.

317
00:15:11.972 --> 00:15:15.712
<v ->Excellent, I come back to what I said earlier.</v>

318
00:15:15.712 --> 00:15:18.424
The education start at home,

319
00:15:18.424 --> 00:15:21.203
at an early age.

320
00:15:21.203 --> 00:15:23.261
Take them to that place of wholeness,

321
00:15:23.261 --> 00:15:27.761
to that place of spirit, to the place of they are beautiful,

322
00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:32.082
they are goddess, they are to respect their body.

323
00:15:32.082 --> 00:15:34.802
They are to learn that from their parents,

324
00:15:34.802 --> 00:15:37.962
so if their parents don't have the awareness, what do we do?

325
00:15:37.962 --> 00:15:39.810
They all grown up with Barbies.

326
00:15:42.241 --> 00:15:43.361
<v Voiceover>And trying to look like Barbies.</v>

327
00:15:43.361 --> 00:15:46.812
<v ->Naturally. That's what education's about</v>

328
00:15:46.812 --> 00:15:49.732
to girls, and to boys it's guns and

329
00:15:49.732 --> 00:15:53.432
at a young age they're going hunting and (sighs).

330
00:15:53.432 --> 00:15:54.512
<v Voiceover>So now, how do we bring</v>

331
00:15:54.512 --> 00:15:56.732
these boys and girls together, considering?

332
00:15:56.732 --> 00:15:59.432
<v ->At the teen time, it's already too late.</v>

333
00:15:59.432 --> 00:16:02.950
We can create workshops for teenagers.

334
00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.210
We can create retreats for teenagers,

335
00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.470
to allow them to release all the anger that they

336
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:13.400
carry towards their parents most of the time.

337
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.378
It's already late.

338
00:16:15.378 --> 00:16:17.538
<v Voiceover>And the hostility they're carrying</v>

339
00:16:17.538 --> 00:16:20.378
toward the other sex as well, both.

340
00:16:20.378 --> 00:16:24.138
There's a lot of anger and hostility

341
00:16:24.138 --> 00:16:27.038
that's going on through media generated.

342
00:16:27.038 --> 00:16:29.536
<v ->That comes from that place where</v>

343
00:16:29.536 --> 00:16:31.555
when they go to school and they start,

344
00:16:31.555 --> 00:16:33.314
I don't know the school system here,

345
00:16:33.314 --> 00:16:36.634
what their names are, but they're like 11, 12?

346
00:16:36.634 --> 00:16:41.163
The only mind pattern system is

347
00:16:41.163 --> 00:16:45.511
attract boy to me and start smoking and wear

348
00:16:45.511 --> 00:16:49.060
mini skirts to go to school, makeups, all this.

349
00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:53.990
Making them grown like a woman much earlier than it is.

350
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:57.287
When these boy are not coming to them, they do get angry.

351
00:16:57.287 --> 00:16:59.887
And what they do, I found out by studying

352
00:16:59.887 --> 00:17:02.867
psychology and all the articles being written,

353
00:17:02.867 --> 00:17:05.487
they manage, in the family, to get

354
00:17:05.487 --> 00:17:10.167
somebody to be with them intimately.

355
00:17:10.167 --> 00:17:13.335
And that can be a cousin, a nephew,

356
00:17:13.335 --> 00:17:16.993
somebody in the house, in the family, an uncle.

357
00:17:16.993 --> 00:17:19.793
And then they create a whole rape thing about it.

358
00:17:19.793 --> 00:17:23.213
They create with their mind.

359
00:17:23.213 --> 00:17:26.092
I have had some student who has never

360
00:17:26.092 --> 00:17:28.571
been raped by member of the family,

361
00:17:28.571 --> 00:17:31.311
but they are convinced they've been raped

362
00:17:31.311 --> 00:17:33.191
and this is part of what you're saying.

363
00:17:33.191 --> 00:17:35.349
<v Voiceover>Yes, it is. And then the anger</v>

364
00:17:35.349 --> 00:17:37.829
patterns have developed by then and then you

365
00:17:37.829 --> 00:17:42.589
have a passive-aggressive relationship, at very best.

366
00:17:42.589 --> 00:17:47.487
So, we, when we look at

367
00:17:47.487 --> 00:17:49.527
the young men and women and they're ready

368
00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:52.627
to enter into their sexual years,

369
00:17:52.627 --> 00:17:55.607
and this is natural, you know?

370
00:17:55.607 --> 00:17:56.267
<v ->Naturally.</v>

371
00:17:56.267 --> 00:17:57.967
<v Voiceover>12, 13, 14, 15, 16.</v>

372
00:17:57.967 --> 00:17:59.027
<v ->Not 12, but--</v>

373
00:17:59.027 --> 00:18:00.687
<v Voiceover>Some people, now. (chuckles)</v>

374
00:18:00.687 --> 00:18:01.587
<v ->Nine.</v>

375
00:18:01.587 --> 00:18:05.367
<v Voiceover>But, nine. Yes, of course nine. Yes.</v>

376
00:18:05.367 --> 00:18:08.082
We look at this and how do you guide

377
00:18:08.082 --> 00:18:11.582
your children, regarding sexuality, to where

378
00:18:11.582 --> 00:18:15.502
it's a healthy and it's a positive experience

379
00:18:15.502 --> 00:18:17.782
the first time because I feel that the first time

380
00:18:17.782 --> 00:18:20.982
for these people is critical for everybody.

381
00:18:20.982 --> 00:18:24.058
<v ->It is critical, but it mostly,</v>

382
00:18:24.058 --> 00:18:28.889
most young girls or boys,

383
00:18:28.889 --> 00:18:31.057
there's a whole game and competition

384
00:18:31.057 --> 00:18:34.037
at school with that first relationship.

385
00:18:34.037 --> 00:18:37.096
So, it's not healthy no matter what.

386
00:18:37.096 --> 00:18:39.936
If any parent with their child, to be

387
00:18:39.936 --> 00:18:43.076
in a healthy sexual relationship,

388
00:18:43.076 --> 00:18:45.756
they have to be taught at an early age.

389
00:18:45.756 --> 00:18:48.036
What does it mean? What is hormones?

390
00:18:48.036 --> 00:18:50.235
What the hormones is about?

391
00:18:50.235 --> 00:18:52.635
What is happening in their body?

392
00:18:52.635 --> 00:18:56.155
This is to be taught, this is to be educated.

393
00:18:56.155 --> 00:18:57.115
<v Voiceover>So they know that,</v>

394
00:18:57.115 --> 00:18:59.014
not to be surprised when all of this begins.

395
00:18:59.014 --> 00:19:00.274
<v ->Correct, and not to be scared</v>

396
00:19:00.274 --> 00:19:03.732
and not to be frightened of what's happening

397
00:19:03.732 --> 00:19:06.592
in their body, all these transformation in their body.

398
00:19:06.592 --> 00:19:09.272
And I will even say a father has a big role

399
00:19:09.272 --> 00:19:12.172
in that towards their daughters, big role.

400
00:19:12.172 --> 00:19:14.192
<v Voiceover>How so? Explain.</v>

401
00:19:14.192 --> 00:19:17.776
<v ->What happens is that, for the daughter, the father</v>

402
00:19:17.776 --> 00:19:22.761
is the first attractive man in their life.

403
00:19:22.761 --> 00:19:26.513
The father has to explain all these hormones,

404
00:19:26.513 --> 00:19:28.872
and mother together.

405
00:19:28.872 --> 00:19:31.092
There's a role that the father has

406
00:19:31.092 --> 00:19:33.590
toward their daughter, which is going to help

407
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:37.131
to create a mature woman in the future.

408
00:19:37.131 --> 00:19:38.691
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about what that conversation</v>

409
00:19:38.691 --> 00:19:41.031
would be like because often in the West,

410
00:19:41.031 --> 00:19:42.811
the father's left out entirely.

411
00:19:42.811 --> 00:19:45.431
The father talks to the son, maybe.

412
00:19:45.431 --> 00:19:47.771
The mother, maybe, talks to the daughter.

413
00:19:47.771 --> 00:19:49.571
And that's about as much as you get.

414
00:19:49.571 --> 00:19:51.311
And usually it's a little pamphlet

415
00:19:51.311 --> 00:19:54.551
or a little conversation on, "This is what's going on.

416
00:19:54.551 --> 00:19:56.921
"We'll need to get you some little bras."

417
00:19:56.921 --> 00:19:59.129
You know, these kinds of very, very basic

418
00:19:59.129 --> 00:20:01.489
sorts of things, nothing that goes into the spirit.

419
00:20:01.489 --> 00:20:04.509
Let's talk, let's emulate that kind of conversation

420
00:20:04.509 --> 00:20:06.029
that a father and a mother would

421
00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:09.328
have with a daughter or a son.

422
00:20:09.328 --> 00:20:13.928
<v ->I remember when Elodie, my daughter, get to that place,</v>

423
00:20:13.928 --> 00:20:16.255
and I remember when I get to that place,

424
00:20:16.255 --> 00:20:19.619
how my parents sat me and explain everything to me.

425
00:20:19.619 --> 00:20:22.519
And my, I remember my parents even said,

426
00:20:22.519 --> 00:20:25.919
"We are not responsible if you are pregnant."

427
00:20:25.919 --> 00:20:28.359
That was very clear to me.

428
00:20:28.359 --> 00:20:30.999
In our culture, we don't do that also.

429
00:20:30.999 --> 00:20:33.139
But they made it very clear.

430
00:20:33.139 --> 00:20:34.879
<v Voiceover>Meaning you're on your own?</v>

431
00:20:34.879 --> 00:20:36.999
<v ->Oh yes. They said, "We will not be</v>

432
00:20:36.999 --> 00:20:39.679
"responsible if you are pregnant."

433
00:20:39.679 --> 00:20:42.079
And that is what can happen from now on.

434
00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:44.259
That was when I got my period.

435
00:20:44.259 --> 00:20:45.957
And then there was celebration.

436
00:20:45.957 --> 00:20:47.957
In our culture, we celebrate that.

437
00:20:47.957 --> 00:20:51.057
We become a goddess to the eyes of the world.

438
00:20:51.057 --> 00:20:52.037
That's one thing.

439
00:20:52.037 --> 00:20:54.057
And when Elodie came to that point,

440
00:20:54.057 --> 00:20:57.617
I sat her and I spoke to her, her father spoke to her.

441
00:20:57.617 --> 00:21:00.137
"This is now, if you go and have any

442
00:21:00.137 --> 00:21:02.914
physical sexual relationsihp with somebody,

443
00:21:02.914 --> 00:21:07.874
you may be pregnant. What is your choice?"

444
00:21:07.874 --> 00:21:12.213
Meaning, give the child a responsiblity.

445
00:21:12.213 --> 00:21:15.633
How will you feel if this happen?

446
00:21:15.633 --> 00:21:19.853
You're going to school, what do you want really?

447
00:21:19.853 --> 00:21:24.093
I will say matured conversation with your children.

448
00:21:24.093 --> 00:21:26.242
And make them take responsibilities.

449
00:21:28.852 --> 00:21:31.552
<v Voiceover>And then, beyond the maturity</v>

450
00:21:31.552 --> 00:21:34.011
of understanding the repercussions,

451
00:21:34.011 --> 00:21:36.931
what about the emotional, mental preparation

452
00:21:36.931 --> 00:21:41.331
for entering into something that's healthy?

453
00:21:41.331 --> 00:21:43.491
<v ->I'll come back to that place.</v>

454
00:21:43.491 --> 00:21:45.971
When you start to speak to the child,

455
00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:50.631
speak to the child also what's happening in their body.

456
00:21:50.631 --> 00:21:54.191
The uncomfort, the heat, the,

457
00:21:54.191 --> 00:21:56.191
don't even know what's going on.

458
00:21:56.191 --> 00:21:59.031
It can be scary.

459
00:21:59.031 --> 00:22:01.411
If a child has all these things

460
00:22:01.411 --> 00:22:03.951
going on hormonally by itself.

461
00:22:03.951 --> 00:22:06.811
So explain first the hormone situation.

462
00:22:06.811 --> 00:22:08.831
What happen to the ovaries, what happens?

463
00:22:08.831 --> 00:22:11.868
At all level, boys and girls.

464
00:22:11.868 --> 00:22:15.358
Both go to the same process in the body.

465
00:22:15.358 --> 00:22:17.546
The body's growing, so you have desire.

466
00:22:17.546 --> 00:22:19.606
What to do with this desire?

467
00:22:19.606 --> 00:22:22.726
And teach them about the mind.

468
00:22:22.726 --> 00:22:26.646
You become what you think, so if they have

469
00:22:26.646 --> 00:22:29.144
this high desire in self and they don't know

470
00:22:29.144 --> 00:22:32.723
what to do with it, change the thoughts.

471
00:22:32.723 --> 00:22:35.722
Project the thoughts in something else.

472
00:22:35.722 --> 00:22:37.222
So for that, the parents has to know

473
00:22:37.222 --> 00:22:38.602
what they give to their child.

474
00:22:38.602 --> 00:22:40.542
<v Voiceover>So that it doesn't become an obsession.</v>

475
00:22:40.542 --> 00:22:45.182
<v ->Absolutely. Maybe sports, creativity,</v>

476
00:22:45.182 --> 00:22:49.362
painting, dancing, activities, outside activities,

477
00:22:49.362 --> 00:22:52.622
outside door activities, there are so many things.

478
00:22:52.622 --> 00:22:54.076
<v Voiceover>And let's say they've</v>

479
00:22:54.076 --> 00:22:56.066
matured a little bit more and now they're

480
00:22:56.066 --> 00:22:58.835
well into their teens and they find a boy or girl

481
00:22:58.835 --> 00:23:01.635
that they really really like and they really relate to.

482
00:23:01.635 --> 00:23:04.834
<v ->I appreciate the word like, not love. Thank you.</v>

483
00:23:04.834 --> 00:23:06.714
<v Voiceover>Yes, like. (giggles)</v>

484
00:23:06.714 --> 00:23:09.573
And let's talk about how, if at all,

485
00:23:09.573 --> 00:23:13.953
the parent begins assisting at this point now and what,

486
00:23:13.953 --> 00:23:17.193
how to prepare a child, or a young person for this.

487
00:23:17.193 --> 00:23:19.253
<v ->When we talk of relationship between</v>

488
00:23:19.253 --> 00:23:22.211
young adults, it's important to tell them,

489
00:23:22.211 --> 00:23:24.531
"Please know that that may not be

490
00:23:24.531 --> 00:23:27.511
"the relationship you live with for 25 years."

491
00:23:27.511 --> 00:23:29.331
Make sure they know they are free to leave

492
00:23:29.331 --> 00:23:32.750
a relationship if it's not harmonious

493
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:35.630
and it's not healthy for them.

494
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:40.050
They are not to live with a person forever.

495
00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.950
That's very, very important.

496
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:44.190
How to be in a healthy relationship

497
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.209
is first to realize that there's not only two.

498
00:23:47.209 --> 00:23:50.568
Like, we think, let's say we live together.

499
00:23:50.568 --> 00:23:54.228
We are young teenagers, adults, and we,

500
00:23:54.228 --> 00:23:57.148
we think there's only two but there are three.

501
00:23:57.148 --> 00:24:01.248
There's you, there's me, and there's the relationship.

502
00:24:01.248 --> 00:24:04.388
And whatever I put in the relationship,

503
00:24:04.388 --> 00:24:06.068
this is what I'm going to get.

504
00:24:06.068 --> 00:24:08.788
So, do I choose to be aware and be mature

505
00:24:08.788 --> 00:24:13.058
in what I create in my relationship with you?

506
00:24:13.058 --> 00:24:14.286
Explain that.

507
00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:17.686
I think this should be done at school.

508
00:24:17.686 --> 00:24:21.146
Explain about relationship.

509
00:24:21.146 --> 00:24:24.966
How to create a healthy relationship.

510
00:24:24.966 --> 00:24:28.626
How a relationship is not equal sex.

511
00:24:28.626 --> 00:24:32.346
The thing is this country, everything refers is sex.

512
00:24:32.346 --> 00:24:35.506
No matter what somebody does, it's about sex.

513
00:24:35.506 --> 00:24:38.346
That's not the case.

514
00:24:38.346 --> 00:24:39.726
<v Voiceover>Yes, and try telling the</v>

515
00:24:39.726 --> 00:24:42.105
advertising industry that in this country.

516
00:24:42.105 --> 00:24:44.185
Since everything is oriented there.

517
00:24:44.185 --> 00:24:46.285
And part of the reason I ask this

518
00:24:46.285 --> 00:24:48.505
is my observation has been when you have

519
00:24:48.505 --> 00:24:52.285
a person, say a young boy, who with his friends have,

520
00:24:52.285 --> 00:24:54.865
in high school or even junior high, gotten a girl

521
00:24:54.865 --> 00:24:58.025
drunk and then taken advantage of this girl

522
00:24:58.025 --> 00:25:00.784
while she's virtually unconscious and not very aware.

523
00:25:00.784 --> 00:25:02.243
<v ->I've read all this too.</v>

524
00:25:02.243 --> 00:25:05.223
<v Voiceover>Yes. This sets a totally different</v>

525
00:25:05.223 --> 00:25:07.983
relationship to the nature of sexuality

526
00:25:07.983 --> 00:25:08.853
with another human being.

527
00:25:08.853 --> 00:25:11.695
<v ->Of course, naturally, and then with that aggressivity.</v>

528
00:25:11.695 --> 00:25:14.655
And this has happened when I was doing my work

529
00:25:14.655 --> 00:25:18.284
as a therapist again, this has happened in the same family.

530
00:25:20.594 --> 00:25:22.954
When the nephews, the cousins, they come

531
00:25:22.954 --> 00:25:25.894
and they take the girl, they go to play in the forest

532
00:25:25.894 --> 00:25:27.264
and they get drunk,

533
00:25:27.264 --> 00:25:31.104
drunk the girl and rape her.

534
00:25:31.104 --> 00:25:32.263
<v Voiceover>And then, that becomes</v>

535
00:25:32.263 --> 00:25:33.823
a predilection for that person.

536
00:25:33.823 --> 00:25:36.023
That is their behavior, that's the stamp

537
00:25:36.023 --> 00:25:37.363
of the beginning of that behavior.

538
00:25:37.363 --> 00:25:38.463
<v ->Unfortunately.</v>

539
00:25:38.463 --> 00:25:39.040
<v Voiceover>So we need to--</v>

540
00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.499
<v ->The wounds. So then we get to a place</v>

541
00:25:41.499 --> 00:25:45.237
where this teenager grow,

542
00:25:45.237 --> 00:25:48.107
become an adult with the wounds.

543
00:25:48.107 --> 00:25:51.433
It goes in the whole body, then it create cancer.

544
00:25:51.433 --> 00:25:53.264
This is where disease come,

545
00:25:53.264 --> 00:25:57.103
when the emotional body is sick.

546
00:25:57.103 --> 00:26:01.342
Then, naturally, the, it takes some years or some months,

547
00:26:01.342 --> 00:26:03.299
depending on the degree of the wounds.

548
00:26:03.299 --> 00:26:06.770
Then the physical body get wounded.

549
00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:11.150
<v Voiceover>So our taking very great care</v>

550
00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:14.030
from the point of conception forward

551
00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:18.170
to bring true light and education to our children

552
00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:20.510
has to be our number one charge,

553
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.350
other than our own upliftment.

554
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:25.410
<v ->Priority. And be aware when we say,</v>

555
00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:27.290
"Taking good care." What does that mean?

556
00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:29.330
Does it mean you cocooned the child?

557
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:33.887
Does it mean you mother the child, you know?

558
00:26:33.887 --> 00:26:34.925
<v Voiceover>Educate the child.</v>

559
00:26:34.925 --> 00:26:38.662
<v ->Educate, bring education, correct.</v>

560
00:26:38.662 --> 00:26:41.462
And it's not an easy job.

561
00:26:41.462 --> 00:26:43.202
<v Voiceover>And now, we've come full-cycle</v>

562
00:26:43.202 --> 00:26:45.582
because they'll be prepared to bear a child.

563
00:26:45.582 --> 00:26:47.662
So, I wanted to go through and I really

564
00:26:47.662 --> 00:26:50.022
appreciate your elucidation on the subject

565
00:26:50.022 --> 00:26:52.882
of how you do this cycle in a healthy manner.

566
00:26:52.882 --> 00:26:55.682
<v ->And I will go further now.</v>

567
00:26:55.682 --> 00:26:59.702
When a person is ready, the body

568
00:26:59.702 --> 00:27:03.341
has been created, call for the soul who's

569
00:27:03.341 --> 00:27:06.601
ready to come for this energy.

570
00:27:06.601 --> 00:27:09.861
Be of service to a soul.

571
00:27:09.861 --> 00:27:14.481
As, you know, we do

572
00:27:14.481 --> 00:27:17.985
choose our parents,

573
00:27:17.985 --> 00:27:20.720
so it's important to invoke in your

574
00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:25.629
meditation, in your time of awareness,

575
00:27:25.629 --> 00:27:29.008
call for the soul who's ready to be in that place.

576
00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.318
<v Voiceover>I dreamt of my son</v>

577
00:27:32.318 --> 00:27:36.457
for about 12 years before he finally came in.

578
00:27:36.457 --> 00:27:38.257
<v ->And I'm sure you get along very well.</v>

579
00:27:38.257 --> 00:27:40.877
<v Voiceover>Oh, extraordinarily, yes.</v>

580
00:27:40.877 --> 00:27:43.621
But there was that communication happening

581
00:27:43.621 --> 00:27:45.880
for years and years prior.

582
00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.780
It was beautiful and yet, I wasn't aware

583
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:52.780
to call it forth myself at that time yet.

584
00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:55.600
I didn't have the knowledge I have now, of course.

585
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:58.520
But, even so, we have to understand

586
00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.120
that these relationships have been

587
00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.240
created far long before we ever see

588
00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.380
their little head pop into the world.

589
00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.578
Yes, and respect this.

590
00:28:08.578 --> 00:28:10.457
<v ->'Cause we do create a contract</v>

591
00:28:10.457 --> 00:28:14.467
with, in the other world before incarnation.

592
00:28:14.467 --> 00:28:17.226
<v Voiceover>Yes. Is there anything else</v>

593
00:28:17.226 --> 00:28:19.526
other than that final comment, that you have to say

594
00:28:19.526 --> 00:28:22.146
about the notion of bringing a person

595
00:28:22.146 --> 00:28:23.926
into the world and educating them?

596
00:28:23.926 --> 00:28:27.906
<v ->Make sure that each woman who is ready</v>

597
00:28:27.906 --> 00:28:32.508
to carry a child deal with her own wounds and pains.

598
00:28:34.681 --> 00:28:37.707
Clear this pain, release these sufferings,

599
00:28:37.707 --> 00:28:40.067
this resentment, this anger towards

600
00:28:40.067 --> 00:28:42.847
the opposite sex, most of the time.

601
00:28:42.847 --> 00:28:46.287
Release all of that, or else all this energy

602
00:28:46.287 --> 00:28:49.827
will go to the embryo with the fear,

603
00:28:49.827 --> 00:28:53.167
"I hope this doesn't happen to him or her."

604
00:28:53.167 --> 00:28:57.367
So, release all of this and I'm ready to serve.

605
00:28:57.367 --> 00:29:00.867
<v Voiceover>Yes, absolutely beautiful, thank you.</v>

606
00:29:00.867 --> 00:29:02.757
<v ->And blessings to all of you.</v>

607
00:29:02.757 --> 00:29:06.265
(light tranquil music)

608
00:29:06.265 --> 00:29:08.385
<v ->For more on Sai Maa's work in the world,</v>
