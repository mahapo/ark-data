00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.808
(mystical music)

2
00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:14.399
<v ->Of all the religions of the world, one of the</v>

3
00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:16.427
most mystical is that of Sufism.

4
00:00:16.427 --> 00:00:18.580
It's roots are Islamic, and the practice

5
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.043
is one of the heart.

6
00:00:20.043 --> 00:00:23.156
Shaikh Kabir Helminski was the first Westerner recognized

7
00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:27.061
as a shake or elder in the the Mevlevi order of Sufism

8
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:28.937
which dates back to the 13th century

9
00:00:28.937 --> 00:00:30.868
and is based on the works of the great poet

10
00:00:30.868 --> 00:00:32.447
and philosopher, Rumi.

11
00:00:32.447 --> 00:00:34.378
In the West we know a little of this tradition

12
00:00:34.378 --> 00:00:36.233
other than the beautiful poems of Rumi

13
00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:38.068
which have been excerpted to appear

14
00:00:38.068 --> 00:00:39.199
on greeting cards.

15
00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.855
Here Shaikh Helminski explains that among other things,

16
00:00:41.855 --> 00:00:44.493
Sufism has been at the heart of Islam,

17
00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:47.138
but has been marginalized somewhat by extremism.

18
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.990
I would like it if you could begin to tell me about

19
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.816
the essence of this Sufi way.

20
00:01:02.077 --> 00:01:06.141
<v ->Let's start with Rumi since he has been the major</v>

21
00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:09.846
voice of Sufism in the West recently,

22
00:01:10.813 --> 00:01:13.472
and very popular, very beloved.

23
00:01:13.617 --> 00:01:16.658
People intuitively sense that there's something here

24
00:01:16.658 --> 00:01:21.658
of beauty and value, but Rumi was not unique

25
00:01:22.598 --> 00:01:26.358
or even innovative in the Sufi tradition.

26
00:01:26.832 --> 00:01:28.747
He's completely exemplary.

27
00:01:29.104 --> 00:01:31.766
He's an organic outgrowth

28
00:01:32.123 --> 00:01:35.162
of a tradition that goes back

29
00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:37.012
to the prophet Mohammad.

30
00:01:37.274 --> 00:01:38.714
Peace and blessings upon him

31
00:01:38.714 --> 00:01:41.318
and the revelation of the Quarn.

32
00:01:41.318 --> 00:01:43.962
Some people have suggested that Sufism

33
00:01:43.962 --> 00:01:46.398
predates Islam.

34
00:01:47.612 --> 00:01:50.256
If they mean mysticism predated it,

35
00:01:50.256 --> 00:01:53.503
Islam, of course,

36
00:01:54.202 --> 00:01:57.413
but the qualities that we associate with Sufism

37
00:01:57.413 --> 00:02:02.413
really were exemplified beginning with

38
00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.811
the prophet and the

39
00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:08.622
revelation that came through him,

40
00:02:08.622 --> 00:02:11.198
and particularly the language, the metaphysics,

41
00:02:11.523 --> 00:02:15.283
the vocabulary, the context

42
00:02:15.821 --> 00:02:17.159
was all

43
00:02:18.008 --> 00:02:21.672
established about 14 centuries ago,

44
00:02:22.295 --> 00:02:25.015
and Rumi and other great Sufis

45
00:02:25.015 --> 00:02:29.452
are organic outgrowths of that.

46
00:02:29.452 --> 00:02:32.162
They're almost like fractals of that original

47
00:02:32.162 --> 00:02:35.526
truth or revelation.

48
00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:42.209
Rumi is exemplary of his spirituality that

49
00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.521
is very much grounded in life

50
00:02:45.644 --> 00:02:50.644
integrated with our humanness, and I think that's

51
00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:52.310
one of the attractions.

52
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.118
People innately sense that the spirituality that Rumi

53
00:02:56.118 --> 00:02:58.427
offers is

54
00:02:59.435 --> 00:03:01.871
the fulfillment of our humanness,

55
00:03:02.038 --> 00:03:06.006
not something that marginalizes

56
00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:09.717
our humanness or disregards it, but

57
00:03:09.717 --> 00:03:13.461
for Rumi and for all sufis and also for

58
00:03:13.461 --> 00:03:14.805
the prophet Mohammad,

59
00:03:14.805 --> 00:03:19.805
becoming fully human in cooperation with the divine

60
00:03:21.727 --> 00:03:25.199
while living an integrated

61
00:03:25.812 --> 00:03:28.921
useful, practical life.

62
00:03:31.663 --> 00:03:33.753
These are the conditions in which

63
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.914
our

64
00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:39.319
greatest spirituality can be reached.

65
00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.988
Without sacrificing the

66
00:03:43.742 --> 00:03:47.038
highest dimensions of human

67
00:03:47.038 --> 00:03:49.005
spiritual attainment.

68
00:03:49.086 --> 00:03:53.090
In other words, without sacrificing

69
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.666
the experience of oneness

70
00:03:58.108 --> 00:04:01.063
and the trancendent

71
00:04:01.063 --> 00:04:04.311
awesome experience of the divine,

72
00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:08.257
but integrate it with

73
00:04:08.892 --> 00:04:11.573
a humble human life.

74
00:04:12.668 --> 00:04:15.206
<v Woman>And this is interesting when you're talking</v>

75
00:04:15.206 --> 00:04:19.824
about this integration, because we are here at the science

76
00:04:19.824 --> 00:04:22.054
and non-duality conference in which you've

77
00:04:22.054 --> 00:04:24.603
been invited to speak, and you've been invited

78
00:04:24.603 --> 00:04:26.906
throughout your career into some other places

79
00:04:26.906 --> 00:04:31.035
normally reserved for more traditional thinking.

80
00:04:31.035 --> 00:04:34.213
I understand, correct me

81
00:04:34.213 --> 00:04:37.487
if this is not accurate that you were invited in

82
00:04:37.487 --> 00:04:40.879
as one of the first or the first representative to speak

83
00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:45.252
on the Sufi way to Harvard and to the religious studies

84
00:04:45.252 --> 00:04:46.287
department.

85
00:04:46.287 --> 00:04:49.540
You've been breaking ground all along the way,

86
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.718
but it struck me as interesting

87
00:04:52.718 --> 00:04:55.929
at this event in particular, because I'm hearing

88
00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:59.406
a lot of really heavy stuff about everything short of

89
00:04:59.406 --> 00:05:02.424
scraping brain cells onto a slide and trying

90
00:05:02.424 --> 00:05:05.422
to dissect and figure out what consciousness is.

91
00:05:05.422 --> 00:05:09.603
It's very science oriented, and then there's you,

92
00:05:09.603 --> 00:05:11.277
and there are a few others that would be considered

93
00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:14.296
to be more connected into the notion of

94
00:05:14.296 --> 00:05:15.266
the mystical realms.

95
00:05:15.266 --> 00:05:16.845
Why are you here

96
00:05:16.845 --> 00:05:21.607
and what is the science and non-duality aspect of Sufism?

97
00:05:22.913 --> 00:05:24.188
<v ->Good.</v>

98
00:05:28.492 --> 00:05:30.839
I would like to sort of

99
00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:34.337
start with the subject of the human heart.

100
00:05:36.172 --> 00:05:38.650
The human heart understood

101
00:05:38.796 --> 00:05:41.830
as our foremost instrument

102
00:05:42.624 --> 00:05:44.556
for knowing, and

103
00:05:44.556 --> 00:05:46.341
what the heart can know.

104
00:05:47.136 --> 00:05:49.188
Science so far

105
00:05:49.643 --> 00:05:53.348
is receiving information through

106
00:05:53.537 --> 00:05:58.325
the senses, and when I say

107
00:05:58.325 --> 00:06:00.730
through the senses I mean through

108
00:06:00.832 --> 00:06:04.127
the investigation of the material world

109
00:06:04.127 --> 00:06:08.608
which has led science into dimensions

110
00:06:08.608 --> 00:06:10.538
of knowledge that have to do

111
00:06:10.538 --> 00:06:13.087
with energy and ultimately,

112
00:06:13.087 --> 00:06:16.340
the relationship of human intention or

113
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.926
mind to energy

114
00:06:18.975 --> 00:06:21.086
and material, and this is

115
00:06:21.086 --> 00:06:24.895
a very exciting area, but I

116
00:06:24.895 --> 00:06:26.978
would maintain that it's still.

117
00:06:27.753 --> 00:06:29.096
Science is still at a very

118
00:06:29.096 --> 00:06:32.371
crude stage of understanding

119
00:06:32.371 --> 00:06:35.106
the whole picture of

120
00:06:35.411 --> 00:06:38.312
existence and the human being's

121
00:06:38.312 --> 00:06:41.288
place in existence, and what's so far missing

122
00:06:41.288 --> 00:06:43.378
from science which I would like to bring

123
00:06:43.378 --> 00:06:46.829
attention to is that

124
00:06:47.228 --> 00:06:51.453
through this very extraordinary instrument

125
00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:55.788
called the heart, human experience

126
00:06:55.965 --> 00:06:59.180
is opened up to a qualitative universe.

127
00:06:59.462 --> 00:07:02.785
What about a science of qualities?

128
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:04.849
Are we even close to that yet?

129
00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:07.248
What I mean by qualities are things like

130
00:07:09.368 --> 00:07:11.942
sensing meaning and significance,

131
00:07:11.942 --> 00:07:13.952
sensing relationship,

132
00:07:14.427 --> 00:07:15.552
sensing

133
00:07:17.893 --> 00:07:21.620
the tenderness of the universe,

134
00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:24.265
the way in which the universe

135
00:07:24.667 --> 00:07:28.094
is intelligent and nurturing

136
00:07:28.528 --> 00:07:31.604
and the way every human being

137
00:07:31.823 --> 00:07:36.392
who is not, shall we say, pathologically

138
00:07:36.932 --> 00:07:39.550
handicapped, disabled,

139
00:07:41.163 --> 00:07:43.502
every healthy human being

140
00:07:44.804 --> 00:07:46.888
finds joy in relationship,

141
00:07:48.248 --> 00:07:52.232
and in relationship discovers

142
00:07:52.312 --> 00:07:57.312
qualities that are the most valued, enduring qualities

143
00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:01.330
that we know in our experience.

144
00:08:01.901 --> 00:08:06.901
It's the heart that gives us that capacity.

145
00:08:09.005 --> 00:08:11.899
The human being who experiences

146
00:08:12.301 --> 00:08:15.803
himself or herself as a

147
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.858
finite entity with a limited life span

148
00:08:21.142 --> 00:08:23.681
I seem to be talking in duality,

149
00:08:23.681 --> 00:08:25.510
but bear with me.

150
00:08:25.813 --> 00:08:30.778
We experience ourselves as finite encountering the infinite.

151
00:08:32.917 --> 00:08:36.768
In that experience we are open to things like

152
00:08:36.768 --> 00:08:39.737
humbleness, awe,

153
00:08:40.458 --> 00:08:43.866
love, appreciation of beauty,

154
00:08:44.831 --> 00:08:46.570
beauty not just on a physical level,

155
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.941
but we even have a sense of spiritual beauty as

156
00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:54.089
a possibility, as a yearning for something

157
00:08:54.089 --> 00:08:58.169
extraordinarily pure and beautiful.

158
00:08:58.228 --> 00:09:00.968
This is innate in our souls,

159
00:09:00.968 --> 00:09:03.081
in our heart, in our experience.

160
00:09:03.081 --> 00:09:04.243
If you don't believe in soul and heart,

161
00:09:04.243 --> 00:09:07.832
let's just say in our experience, and

162
00:09:08.051 --> 00:09:12.201
in speaking about spirituality, this is a little footnote.

163
00:09:12.201 --> 00:09:16.216
I'm speaking not from some doctrine primarily,

164
00:09:16.594 --> 00:09:21.138
but from experience and my own presence

165
00:09:21.138 --> 00:09:23.388
at the laboratory of experience.

166
00:09:23.388 --> 00:09:26.579
As I look to my own experience I see there

167
00:09:26.579 --> 00:09:28.669
are all these extraordinary possibilities

168
00:09:28.669 --> 00:09:33.669
as an individual, and I'm an individual.

169
00:09:34.055 --> 00:09:37.879
How does that relate to this non-dual reality?

170
00:09:38.118 --> 00:09:42.502
It's a beautiful paradox that the

171
00:09:42.502 --> 00:09:46.560
enigma of individuality is

172
00:09:47.056 --> 00:09:51.004
resolved in the experience

173
00:09:51.004 --> 00:09:55.732
of relationships with a divine source.

174
00:09:55.878 --> 00:09:59.744
The sufi put it simply knows

175
00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:05.059
that our consciousness, our love,

176
00:10:05.924 --> 00:10:09.983
our will, our capacity for forgiveness,

177
00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:14.078
every function

178
00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:16.841
and quality of our being

179
00:10:17.349 --> 00:10:20.713
is given to us

180
00:10:21.091 --> 00:10:25.502
graced to us by an infinite source of life,

181
00:10:26.264 --> 00:10:29.316
and at a certain stage, as you make that journey

182
00:10:29.316 --> 00:10:33.700
of consciousness into yourself.

183
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:38.700
As you step back behind your desires,

184
00:10:38.905 --> 00:10:42.178
emotional reactions, passing thoughts,

185
00:10:42.178 --> 00:10:46.929
and come to that realm of pure subjectivity

186
00:10:47.373 --> 00:10:51.596
you experience that, our very presence

187
00:10:51.596 --> 00:10:54.135
our consciousness is sourced

188
00:10:54.135 --> 00:10:58.338
in that let's call it non-dual reality, which we

189
00:10:58.338 --> 00:10:59.719
call Allah.

190
00:10:59.938 --> 00:11:04.764
Fortunately, the Quran is pretty fastidious

191
00:11:04.834 --> 00:11:08.086
in not creating any dogma

192
00:11:08.086 --> 00:11:11.654
about a law, about God.

193
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.374
God is indescribable, cannot be conceived,

194
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.396
therefore, cannot be argued about.

195
00:11:16.396 --> 00:11:18.208
The very, very

196
00:11:18.208 --> 00:11:21.366
refined and subtle notion of the divinity

197
00:11:21.366 --> 00:11:25.103
that exists in Islam, and

198
00:11:25.451 --> 00:11:29.238
sufis have found the Quran to be a beautiful

199
00:11:29.238 --> 00:11:33.675
vehicle for expressing and understanding

200
00:11:33.675 --> 00:11:36.853
this non-dual reality, but what it comes down to

201
00:11:36.853 --> 00:11:39.075
very simply is that

202
00:11:39.573 --> 00:11:42.868
there is no power, nor agency but with God,

203
00:11:44.504 --> 00:11:49.467
and the human being is as an individual is

204
00:11:49.473 --> 00:11:51.762
the fruition of

205
00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.455
the divine in this realm of existence,

206
00:11:56.599 --> 00:11:58.667
and that the purpose of our lives

207
00:11:58.667 --> 00:12:02.124
is to come to more fully know

208
00:12:02.124 --> 00:12:07.124
the awesome beauty and generosity

209
00:12:08.161 --> 00:12:11.247
and intelligence of the divine.

210
00:12:14.752 --> 00:12:17.402
Simultaneously we have individuality

211
00:12:17.611 --> 00:12:20.533
and we have that individuality sourced in the ground

212
00:12:20.533 --> 00:12:23.051
of being, and yet

213
00:12:23.051 --> 00:12:24.512
we have a purpose here in life

214
00:12:24.512 --> 00:12:26.480
which is to know,

215
00:12:26.688 --> 00:12:29.519
to know and love God,

216
00:12:30.987 --> 00:12:32.975
and we do that through ourselves,

217
00:12:33.216 --> 00:12:34.862
through our own experience,

218
00:12:34.911 --> 00:12:36.601
through relationship,

219
00:12:36.671 --> 00:12:39.267
and through the capacity of the heart.

220
00:12:39.488 --> 00:12:42.590
It has an extraordinary capacity to know,

221
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:45.150
sense qualitatively, not just

222
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:49.955
quantitatively or mathematically the

223
00:12:50.975 --> 00:12:52.547
universe of qualities.

224
00:12:52.723 --> 00:12:54.974
Sorry for rather long answer, but

225
00:12:54.974 --> 00:12:56.830
<v Woman>No, long answers are good.</v>

226
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.317
It's interesting, because even

227
00:13:00.317 --> 00:13:03.554
in the world of science with all of our

228
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.771
engineering of new technologies to be able

229
00:13:06.771 --> 00:13:10.462
to detect intelligence in life of all kinds,

230
00:13:10.462 --> 00:13:12.499
one of the things that's emerging from that

231
00:13:12.499 --> 00:13:16.264
is that the heart itself appears to have

232
00:13:16.264 --> 00:13:18.423
understanding prior to the brain.

233
00:13:18.632 --> 00:13:21.483
It's our original sensing device

234
00:13:21.671 --> 00:13:25.362
that is connected to, we can say now

235
00:13:25.362 --> 00:13:28.609
perhaps a unified field, the all.

236
00:13:32.227 --> 00:13:35.346
The validation for beginning to allow the heart

237
00:13:35.346 --> 00:13:40.346
to speak is even there within the scientific realms

238
00:13:41.382 --> 00:13:43.728
which is interesting, because it seems as though

239
00:13:43.728 --> 00:13:45.883
people have needed permission somehow

240
00:13:45.883 --> 00:13:47.579
since we entered this materialistic

241
00:13:47.579 --> 00:13:51.205
paradigm a couple hundred years ago.

242
00:13:51.205 --> 00:13:53.638
People have needed permission since then to listen

243
00:13:53.638 --> 00:13:54.405
to the heart.

244
00:13:54.405 --> 00:13:56.335
Now science says it's okay, you can listen to the heart.

245
00:13:56.335 --> 00:13:57.935
It actually gets it before the brain.

246
00:13:57.935 --> 00:13:59.792
We'll just put that out there as a little

247
00:13:59.792 --> 00:14:02.665
modern context to what you're saying.

248
00:14:02.768 --> 00:14:04.816
<v ->And of course by the heart, I mean</v>

249
00:14:04.816 --> 00:14:06.459
more than the physical heart.

250
00:14:06.459 --> 00:14:08.527
I don't mean to limit it to the core.

251
00:14:08.527 --> 00:14:10.992
I don't mean reify what I'm talking about

252
00:14:10.992 --> 00:14:13.124
to mean the physical heart,

253
00:14:13.124 --> 00:14:15.119
and yet the physical heart itself

254
00:14:15.119 --> 00:14:17.395
is extraordinary.

255
00:14:17.583 --> 00:14:19.279
<v Woman>It's intuitive, it's connected.</v>

256
00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:21.605
<v ->It's intuitive and it has a huge,</v>

257
00:14:21.605 --> 00:14:25.049
it's a huge electromagnetic phenomena

258
00:14:25.049 --> 00:14:26.425
in our own being.

259
00:14:27.961 --> 00:14:29.423
<v Woman>You're speaking of heart with</v>

260
00:14:29.423 --> 00:14:32.303
the capital H, and I do understand that.

261
00:14:32.303 --> 00:14:34.457
I'm just trying to take it into

262
00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:39.457
an undeniable realm of even the small H

263
00:14:39.566 --> 00:14:42.023
heart we can't deny this any longer.

264
00:14:42.585 --> 00:14:43.726
<v ->And that's helpful.</v>

265
00:14:43.726 --> 00:14:46.033
<v Woman>And now,</v>

266
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:51.308
are the sufis sometimes thought of almost as a

267
00:14:51.308 --> 00:14:54.689
an extreme, an extremist sect within

268
00:14:54.689 --> 00:14:58.103
the Islamic faith, because of the

269
00:14:58.103 --> 00:15:01.591
the deep commitment

270
00:15:01.591 --> 00:15:03.660
to living this more gnostic

271
00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.091
or mystical kind of life?

272
00:15:06.091 --> 00:15:09.026
Is there, you understand what I'm saying.

273
00:15:09.026 --> 00:15:10.203
<v ->Yes.</v>

274
00:15:11.116 --> 00:15:14.987
No, sufis have been at the heart

275
00:15:14.987 --> 00:15:19.987
of traditional Islam during most of it's history,

276
00:15:20.865 --> 00:15:23.835
and have had an honored place

277
00:15:23.905 --> 00:15:25.893
within Islam.

278
00:15:26.347 --> 00:15:30.219
Although in recent times for various reasons,

279
00:15:30.219 --> 00:15:35.219
Sufism has been more marginalized in Islamic cultures

280
00:15:35.979 --> 00:15:38.026
because of two factors.

281
00:15:38.026 --> 00:15:42.271
One is because of modernism with it's emphasis

282
00:15:42.271 --> 00:15:45.290
on science and materialism

283
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.747
which affected even Islamic thinking,

284
00:15:47.818 --> 00:15:52.552
and also extremism and fundamentalism

285
00:15:52.552 --> 00:15:57.144
which is in some ways

286
00:15:57.343 --> 00:16:00.733
a new phenomena, a relatively new phenomena in Islam,

287
00:16:00.733 --> 00:16:03.794
and this has caused the marginalization

288
00:16:03.794 --> 00:16:07.554
of Sufism in the most modern times,

289
00:16:07.977 --> 00:16:12.977
but traditionally Islam has been a civilization

290
00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:17.512
which mysticism has come very close to the surface

291
00:16:17.512 --> 00:16:19.601
you might say.

292
00:16:19.601 --> 00:16:24.338
And it's partly because there are many features

293
00:16:24.338 --> 00:16:27.638
many aspects of Islam that are

294
00:16:28.221 --> 00:16:30.188
exclusively mystical.

295
00:16:30.236 --> 00:16:33.420
For instance, people talk about,

296
00:16:33.703 --> 00:16:38.044
imagine that the Quran could be read

297
00:16:38.044 --> 00:16:40.316
in a literalistic way, the way some people

298
00:16:40.316 --> 00:16:41.962
read the Bible.

299
00:16:42.289 --> 00:16:44.870
If you're going to take the Quran literally,

300
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.793
how are you going to deal with

301
00:16:47.793 --> 00:16:49.642
a verse like this,

302
00:16:49.905 --> 00:16:53.824
to God belongs the East and the West,

303
00:16:53.904 --> 00:16:57.418
and wheresoever you look is the face of God.

304
00:16:58.074 --> 00:16:59.771
How could you understand that literally?

305
00:16:59.771 --> 00:17:02.053
You could be a raving mystic

306
00:17:02.053 --> 00:17:06.020
to accept that proposition, or another example,

307
00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.249
Muslims pray five times a day.

308
00:17:08.249 --> 00:17:10.874
They do a series of standing, bowing,

309
00:17:10.874 --> 00:17:12.095
and prostrating.

310
00:17:13.843 --> 00:17:15.283
What are they prostrating to?

311
00:17:15.566 --> 00:17:18.537
A religious institution, a human being?

312
00:17:18.895 --> 00:17:22.365
No, they're standing before the infinite,

313
00:17:22.371 --> 00:17:25.668
and they're putting all their worldly concerns

314
00:17:25.668 --> 00:17:28.359
and preoccupations behind them,

315
00:17:28.409 --> 00:17:31.107
and they're saying the divinity

316
00:17:31.107 --> 00:17:33.842
is greater than everything,

317
00:17:33.891 --> 00:17:37.208
and they hopefully are remembering the

318
00:17:37.208 --> 00:17:41.340
advice of the prophet Mohammad who said

319
00:17:41.548 --> 00:17:45.496
the ritual prayer is only valid

320
00:17:45.496 --> 00:17:46.983
with presence.

321
00:17:47.938 --> 00:17:49.261
<v Woman>True, if you're going through it by wrote,</v>

322
00:17:49.261 --> 00:17:50.486
it has no meaning.

323
00:17:50.486 --> 00:17:53.421
<v ->The ritual prayer itself even at the level</v>

324
00:17:53.421 --> 00:17:56.854
of enteric Islam becomes an exercise

325
00:17:56.854 --> 00:17:58.054
in mindfulness.

326
00:17:58.668 --> 00:18:02.379
In many ways, Sufism

327
00:18:02.379 --> 00:18:06.741
is not exactly the same as the outer

328
00:18:06.741 --> 00:18:11.189
religion of Islam, but it has been a path,

329
00:18:11.189 --> 00:18:13.231
what we call a perica,

330
00:18:13.332 --> 00:18:16.532
and it's explicitly recognized as

331
00:18:16.532 --> 00:18:19.253
a path for those

332
00:18:19.253 --> 00:18:22.250
who seek more than

333
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:26.175
nominal belonging to a religion,

334
00:18:26.175 --> 00:18:28.607
to those kinds of souls

335
00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:31.070
who have a contemplative and

336
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.161
transformational calling,

337
00:18:33.161 --> 00:18:37.427
and Sufi orders particularly since

338
00:18:37.427 --> 00:18:40.957
the 12th century have been pervasive

339
00:18:40.957 --> 00:18:42.281
in the Islamic world.

340
00:18:42.281 --> 00:18:44.914
They're just a part of life, and

341
00:18:44.914 --> 00:18:48.225
<v Woman>And this is really non-exclusive in nature</v>

342
00:18:48.225 --> 00:18:49.996
and global.

343
00:18:49.996 --> 00:18:50.552
<v ->It's global.</v>

344
00:18:50.552 --> 00:18:53.447
It's non-exclusive, and

345
00:18:54.125 --> 00:18:59.125
it's an accepted part

346
00:18:59.553 --> 00:19:02.199
of common consciousness

347
00:19:02.199 --> 00:19:06.001
that some people will be called to this

348
00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:09.909
transformational contemplative way of life

349
00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:14.909
while still having families, holding down a job,

350
00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.366
doing the practical things of life.

351
00:19:19.596 --> 00:19:22.966
This has been a beautiful side, a very enriching side

352
00:19:22.966 --> 00:19:26.037
of Islamic civilization.

353
00:19:26.037 --> 00:19:31.037
Recently, the king of Morocco called a thousand sufi shakes.

354
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.529
This was a few months ago, and I was there.

355
00:19:37.179 --> 00:19:39.832
He wanted to send the message to the world

356
00:19:40.201 --> 00:19:44.077
that sufis should be allowed to do their work,

357
00:19:44.639 --> 00:19:49.639
that they work for the betterment of human souls

358
00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.827
which ultimately benefits cultures,

359
00:19:54.324 --> 00:19:58.359
and they should not be instrumentalized politically

360
00:19:58.409 --> 00:20:01.608
to serve any political purpose, but should be

361
00:20:01.608 --> 00:20:04.210
protected and allowed to do the work

362
00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:06.343
that traditionally they do.

363
00:20:06.343 --> 00:20:07.901
I had the great pleasure of being together

364
00:20:07.901 --> 00:20:12.733
with about 1,000 sufi shakes and scholars.

365
00:20:12.733 --> 00:20:15.466
A third of them were from black Africa.

366
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.482
A third of them were from the Arab world,

367
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.572
and a third of them were from everywhere else

368
00:20:20.572 --> 00:20:23.174
including California and France,

369
00:20:23.174 --> 00:20:25.984
and even China.

370
00:20:26.586 --> 00:20:30.555
It was a great affirmation that sufis

371
00:20:30.555 --> 00:20:34.314
have a place, and that

372
00:20:34.874 --> 00:20:38.121
their work is needed

373
00:20:38.224 --> 00:20:40.933
in todays world, and can

374
00:20:40.933 --> 00:20:43.720
contribute to stability

375
00:20:43.982 --> 00:20:48.222
of societies at a time when

376
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:51.027
there are a lot of destabilizing factors,

377
00:20:51.033 --> 00:20:52.680
particularly extremism.

378
00:20:53.156 --> 00:20:54.168
<v Woman>Of all kinds.</v>

379
00:20:54.168 --> 00:20:58.447
<v ->Yeah, and one of my friends, Cideamid Coastis</v>

380
00:20:58.447 --> 00:21:01.624
who is the assistant minister for religious affairs

381
00:21:01.624 --> 00:21:04.483
in Morocco now has been given a TV program

382
00:21:04.483 --> 00:21:06.867
in Morocco where he talks about

383
00:21:06.947 --> 00:21:11.697
I'd say sufi character, and

384
00:21:11.822 --> 00:21:16.578
extremists who have never for some reason,

385
00:21:16.578 --> 00:21:19.042
they are mostly ignorant people

386
00:21:19.042 --> 00:21:21.863
are being exposed to the beauties of

387
00:21:22.008 --> 00:21:26.658
the teachings on character, and the sweetness

388
00:21:26.658 --> 00:21:29.026
of the sufi heart, and

389
00:21:29.026 --> 00:21:33.361
it's a very beneficial thing

390
00:21:33.431 --> 00:21:36.145
for that society at this time.

391
00:21:36.566 --> 00:21:38.497
<v Woman>And it seems that it's important for us</v>

392
00:21:38.497 --> 00:21:41.047
to understand something here, and you already

393
00:21:41.047 --> 00:21:43.802
touched on this when you were talking about

394
00:21:43.905 --> 00:21:46.689
the prayer five times a day.

395
00:21:46.689 --> 00:21:51.179
This doesn't have to do with minimizing oneself

396
00:21:51.179 --> 00:21:53.942
as a human being before

397
00:21:53.942 --> 00:21:55.258
a deity.

398
00:21:55.606 --> 00:21:59.925
This really is about remembering that aspect

399
00:21:59.925 --> 00:22:02.901
within the self, and there is a line

400
00:22:02.901 --> 00:22:05.824
by Rumi that I just love, and it had to do

401
00:22:05.824 --> 00:22:08.820
with knock and the door will be open unto you,

402
00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.349
and he was saying, I knocked and the door was open,

403
00:22:11.349 --> 00:22:14.623
and then I realized I was knocking from the inside,

404
00:22:14.623 --> 00:22:19.433
meaning we already are that, but we have forgotten

405
00:22:19.433 --> 00:22:20.916
that we already are that, and this is

406
00:22:20.916 --> 00:22:23.583
an awakening and remembering as much as anything.

407
00:22:23.583 --> 00:22:24.232
Is it not?

408
00:22:26.078 --> 00:22:27.331
<v ->That's a good point.</v>

409
00:22:27.752 --> 00:22:29.486
If we look at the prayer,

410
00:22:29.609 --> 00:22:33.431
and you see that people are standing in rows

411
00:22:34.248 --> 00:22:36.940
and they're bowing, and they prostrating.

412
00:22:37.107 --> 00:22:41.192
When they stand, this is a meditative posture

413
00:22:41.192 --> 00:22:46.192
of accepting our human responsibility

414
00:22:46.321 --> 00:22:50.656
as caretakers and as representatives

415
00:22:51.154 --> 00:22:53.952
of the divine in this world.

416
00:22:54.781 --> 00:22:58.098
The bowing reminds us that we're

417
00:22:58.098 --> 00:23:02.550
also servants of creation and each other.

418
00:23:02.598 --> 00:23:07.598
The prostration is a prostration not to any human authority

419
00:23:08.827 --> 00:23:11.722
or human formulation.

420
00:23:12.145 --> 00:23:15.455
The prostration is toward the real,

421
00:23:15.718 --> 00:23:19.028
towards the highest truth itself

422
00:23:19.344 --> 00:23:22.592
and acknowledging that where we

423
00:23:22.821 --> 00:23:25.445
assume the responsibility and authority

424
00:23:25.445 --> 00:23:28.159
in the world, we openly

425
00:23:28.325 --> 00:23:32.665
are surrendered to

426
00:23:32.665 --> 00:23:35.781
the beauty, the grace,

427
00:23:35.781 --> 00:23:38.820
and the power of the divine

428
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.775
without which we would be nothing.

429
00:23:41.775 --> 00:23:44.718
All of our faculties are gifts of the divine.

430
00:23:44.718 --> 00:23:47.160
<v Woman>We'd have no knowing beauty.</v>

431
00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.449
<v ->Right, right, so we</v>

432
00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.124
we are in awe of the beauty of the divine

433
00:23:53.124 --> 00:23:54.820
more than anything else,

434
00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:59.789
and Sufism is a process it's understood as a process of

435
00:23:59.789 --> 00:24:04.188
purifying the heart so that

436
00:24:04.622 --> 00:24:09.622
we perceive, we reach a level of spiritual perception

437
00:24:09.698 --> 00:24:14.698
relatively free of the distortions of egoism, but

438
00:24:15.948 --> 00:24:20.823
the teachings on ego in sufism I think are very practical,

439
00:24:20.823 --> 00:24:24.395
because we don't talk about

440
00:24:24.395 --> 00:24:28.875
destroying the self, and we don't talk about being without

441
00:24:28.875 --> 00:24:32.966
a self, but we do talk about seven levels of the self,

442
00:24:33.132 --> 00:24:38.102
and at the lowest level, the self is in a prison

443
00:24:38.102 --> 00:24:40.325
of compulsions and

444
00:24:40.417 --> 00:24:42.581
<v Woman>Addictions and what not.</v>

445
00:24:44.933 --> 00:24:48.102
<v ->And we move through various levels of subtlization</v>

446
00:24:48.812 --> 00:24:51.940
second level is a stage of

447
00:24:53.408 --> 00:24:56.628
feeling some conscience, awakening of conscience.

448
00:24:56.628 --> 00:24:59.342
The third stage is reaching,

449
00:24:59.904 --> 00:25:02.720
becoming a functioning healthy ego,

450
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.244
a positive human being.

451
00:25:04.244 --> 00:25:07.989
What would be considered salvation in religious terms.

452
00:25:07.989 --> 00:25:11.071
The fourth level of the self in Sufism

453
00:25:11.071 --> 00:25:15.347
is the beginning of awakening into consciousness,

454
00:25:15.347 --> 00:25:17.897
mindfulness, presence.

455
00:25:17.897 --> 00:25:21.172
This is where most of the eserteric teachings begin.

456
00:25:23.899 --> 00:25:27.902
It can be a long phase of our practice

457
00:25:28.261 --> 00:25:31.785
to introduce presence and awareness

458
00:25:31.951 --> 00:25:35.343
into every breath, every action, every relationship.

459
00:25:35.343 --> 00:25:37.850
The fifth level is

460
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:42.850
experiencing unity or intimacy with the divine,

461
00:25:43.258 --> 00:25:45.935
where we have a lived experience

462
00:25:45.935 --> 00:25:50.532
of how everything we are is sourced in the divine.

463
00:25:50.532 --> 00:25:52.804
It's only the fifth stage.

464
00:25:52.804 --> 00:25:55.545
The sixth stage, and I'm going through this as concisely

465
00:25:55.545 --> 00:25:56.334
as I can.

466
00:25:56.334 --> 00:25:59.859
The point being that we always have some

467
00:26:00.141 --> 00:26:03.075
experience of I ness at all these stages.

468
00:26:03.075 --> 00:26:05.303
The sixth stage is when you turn back

469
00:26:05.303 --> 00:26:09.250
from that unity and return to this world

470
00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:13.703
with all of it's conflicts, joys and disappointments,

471
00:26:13.986 --> 00:26:17.496
but with that illumination,

472
00:26:17.496 --> 00:26:19.921
with that awareness that

473
00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:22.114
the divine is closer to us than our

474
00:26:22.114 --> 00:26:23.554
jugular vein.

475
00:26:23.554 --> 00:26:26.807
The sixth stage is almost like

476
00:26:26.807 --> 00:26:28.247
crucifixion.

477
00:26:28.247 --> 00:26:30.976
It's when you experience all the suffering

478
00:26:30.976 --> 00:26:35.723
of life, but without losing your awareness of being

479
00:26:35.723 --> 00:26:37.504
sourced in the divine.

480
00:26:37.504 --> 00:26:39.670
The seventh stage is

481
00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:44.670
being an ordinary human being,

482
00:26:44.939 --> 00:26:49.939
invisible, anonymous, but with

483
00:26:50.165 --> 00:26:51.509
purity of heart,

484
00:26:51.509 --> 00:26:56.509
grounded in this life, but integrating

485
00:26:57.385 --> 00:27:01.443
all levels of consciousness

486
00:27:01.727 --> 00:27:05.048
in that life, but always

487
00:27:05.054 --> 00:27:07.999
the sense of I is transformed.

488
00:27:07.999 --> 00:27:10.922
In the early stages, you were like ice.

489
00:27:10.922 --> 00:27:13.438
You're like a block of ice.

490
00:27:13.438 --> 00:27:15.918
At another stage you melt into water,

491
00:27:16.009 --> 00:27:17.896
the I melts into water.

492
00:27:17.896 --> 00:27:21.118
At another stage it becomes it's steamy, vaporous,

493
00:27:21.118 --> 00:27:23.539
and finally at the highest stage,

494
00:27:23.539 --> 00:27:26.622
it's almost as if one's sense of I

495
00:27:26.622 --> 00:27:29.917
while being locatable

496
00:27:29.917 --> 00:27:34.611
as a person, also has at least an aspect

497
00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:36.840
which is more like humidity.

498
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.481
You sense that your identity

499
00:27:38.481 --> 00:27:42.545
extends in some sense through the universe,

500
00:27:42.545 --> 00:27:47.516
and is in every other me and in every other self,

501
00:27:47.516 --> 00:27:51.142
but still there's always a sense

502
00:27:51.142 --> 00:27:55.227
an ever subtler, more comprehensive sense of self,

503
00:27:55.227 --> 00:27:58.151
so that the self is like the drop.

504
00:27:58.151 --> 00:28:00.262
It doesn't dissolve in the ocean.

505
00:28:00.262 --> 00:28:03.280
The drop realizes it contains the ocean,

506
00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.554
and the drop can choose.

507
00:28:06.554 --> 00:28:08.625
The drop that has reached a certain level

508
00:28:08.625 --> 00:28:13.295
of spiritual maturity can be at will

509
00:28:13.295 --> 00:28:15.332
the drop or the ocean depending on

510
00:28:15.332 --> 00:28:17.957
what the need is at that moment.

511
00:28:17.957 --> 00:28:19.375
<v Woman>And that's why you're at the science in</v>

512
00:28:19.375 --> 00:28:21.647
non-duality conference.

513
00:28:21.647 --> 00:28:22.276
<v ->Yes.</v>

514
00:28:22.276 --> 00:28:26.319
<v Woman>As I was listening to you go through the seven</v>

515
00:28:26.319 --> 00:28:30.105
phases, it seems to me

516
00:28:30.105 --> 00:28:33.027
that Rumi appeared to be writing a lot

517
00:28:33.027 --> 00:28:35.353
of his most well known works from

518
00:28:35.353 --> 00:28:38.724
almost that fifth stage.

519
00:28:38.724 --> 00:28:43.268
<v ->He dissolves that we've heard the ecstatic utterances</v>

520
00:28:43.268 --> 00:28:45.827
were yes, many of them were at that stage,

521
00:28:45.827 --> 00:28:49.026
but he also has his master work is called The Masnavi

522
00:28:49.026 --> 00:28:53.976
and it's six volumes of rhymed couplets

523
00:28:53.976 --> 00:28:58.589
that include stories that are interwoven almost like

524
00:28:58.594 --> 00:28:59.660
soap operas.

525
00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.548
They go on sometimes for 50 pages

526
00:29:01.548 --> 00:29:06.548
with lots of interruptions, and there are sublime prayers.

527
00:29:06.744 --> 00:29:11.202
There are vulgar jokes, but all of it

528
00:29:11.202 --> 00:29:13.826
is a teaching about this oneness,

529
00:29:13.826 --> 00:29:15.500
in every story, every page

530
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.817
reminds us of this oneness.

531
00:29:18.817 --> 00:29:22.859
He has a sober teaching and a systematic teaching,

532
00:29:22.859 --> 00:29:27.859
and a great spiritual psychology that's very practical

533
00:29:28.737 --> 00:29:29.356
as well.

534
00:29:29.356 --> 00:29:30.966
<v Woman>It seems the West has more or less</v>

535
00:29:30.966 --> 00:29:33.910
globbed onto the ecstatic parts that we can interpret

536
00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:35.743
the way we wish.

537
00:29:35.743 --> 00:29:38.411
I think that's probably why it's become so

538
00:29:38.411 --> 00:29:39.969
embraced, but you know that's a wonderful

539
00:29:39.969 --> 00:29:40.821
starting place.

540
00:29:40.821 --> 00:29:41.376
<v ->It's a beginning.</v>

541
00:29:41.376 --> 00:29:42.879
<v Woman>It's a wonderful beginning.</v>

542
00:29:42.879 --> 00:29:45.178
<v ->And that ecstasy and that bliss,</v>

543
00:29:45.279 --> 00:29:46.880
we have a right to that.

544
00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.362
<v Woman>Yes, we do.</v>

545
00:29:48.362 --> 00:29:50.612
<v ->We need it, more than that,</v>

546
00:29:50.612 --> 00:29:51.498
we need it.

547
00:29:51.498 --> 00:29:52.778
<v Woman>We do need that.</v>

548
00:29:52.778 --> 00:29:55.006
I have a couple of practical questions.

549
00:29:55.006 --> 00:29:56.553
The title of Shake.

550
00:29:56.553 --> 00:30:00.671
How is this conferred upon a person, such

551
00:30:00.671 --> 00:30:02.132
as yourself, what's your story?

552
00:30:02.132 --> 00:30:03.849
Because you come out of the Rumi line

553
00:30:03.849 --> 00:30:05.289
as I understand it.

554
00:30:07.422 --> 00:30:11.042
<v ->You can't go to Shake school and get a degree.</v>

555
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:14.200
It's conferred upon someone

556
00:30:14.738 --> 00:30:18.472
by someone in the lineage who has the authority

557
00:30:18.472 --> 00:30:21.127
and respect to confer it on another,

558
00:30:21.127 --> 00:30:23.795
and it usually means I would say two things.

559
00:30:23.795 --> 00:30:27.879
One is that it suggests a certain level

560
00:30:27.879 --> 00:30:32.849
of spiritual realization and maturity, on the one hand.

561
00:30:33.689 --> 00:30:36.306
One has been through the process,

562
00:30:36.306 --> 00:30:38.470
the sufi process,

563
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:41.435
but at the same time it also

564
00:30:41.435 --> 00:30:44.135
represents a certain capacity to

565
00:30:46.335 --> 00:30:48.406
communicate the teaching,

566
00:30:48.465 --> 00:30:50.129
to take some responsibility for

567
00:30:50.129 --> 00:30:54.656
the education of other souls,

568
00:30:55.216 --> 00:30:57.146
and to be in some sense also a manager

569
00:30:57.146 --> 00:30:58.900
of this process.

570
00:31:02.374 --> 00:31:05.557
It's a relatively rare

571
00:31:05.936 --> 00:31:09.428
title in our tradition, and

572
00:31:10.554 --> 00:31:13.157
it's all those things.

573
00:31:13.157 --> 00:31:15.492
It's a whole package of responsibilities.

574
00:31:16.825 --> 00:31:18.181
<v Woman>Thank you for that.</v>

575
00:31:18.181 --> 00:31:20.334
I'm also curious about the whole notion

576
00:31:20.334 --> 00:31:21.797
of whirling dervishes.

577
00:31:21.797 --> 00:31:24.772
This is part of the vernacular western life too,

578
00:31:24.772 --> 00:31:27.738
and I've participated in a couple of shikars through

579
00:31:27.738 --> 00:31:29.807
the years on Rumi's birthday.

580
00:31:29.807 --> 00:31:32.686
In Sedona there were a couple of people

581
00:31:32.686 --> 00:31:36.451
who are just exquisite at reciting the poetry

582
00:31:36.451 --> 00:31:37.796
who would put these events on,

583
00:31:37.796 --> 00:31:40.206
and I enjoyed them and did some

584
00:31:40.206 --> 00:31:42.387
of the whirling myself.

585
00:31:42.489 --> 00:31:45.603
Without, of course, understanding the nature of it

586
00:31:45.603 --> 00:31:46.999
only the experience of it.

587
00:31:46.999 --> 00:31:49.409
What is the nature, the origins

588
00:31:49.409 --> 00:31:52.610
of whirling and the purpose of whirling?

589
00:31:54.412 --> 00:31:57.058
<v ->Whirling exists in a number of forms.</v>

590
00:31:57.058 --> 00:32:01.890
It predates Rumi, but it took a new form with Rumi

591
00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:04.609
and with his teacher Shams of Tabriz.

592
00:32:04.609 --> 00:32:07.575
Shams encouraged this whirling,

593
00:32:08.375 --> 00:32:10.997
and during the time when Rumi

594
00:32:10.997 --> 00:32:14.410
was alive the occasions on which they

595
00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:17.665
came together with music and poetry

596
00:32:17.665 --> 00:32:22.048
and joy and worship and whirling,

597
00:32:22.048 --> 00:32:24.139
sometimes it would go on for days and days.

598
00:32:24.139 --> 00:32:28.949
It was a very spontaneous, but deeply spiritual

599
00:32:28.949 --> 00:32:31.194
activity.

600
00:32:33.088 --> 00:32:36.405
Shortly thereafter, and really

601
00:32:36.405 --> 00:32:38.399
through the knowledge conferred by Shems

602
00:32:38.399 --> 00:32:40.959
to Rumi's son, Deled.

603
00:32:40.959 --> 00:32:45.959
It became more ceremonial, and in the ceremony is

604
00:32:47.199 --> 00:32:52.199
like a living cosmology and alchemy, and

605
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:55.881
it has so many features, but let's start

606
00:32:55.881 --> 00:32:57.950
with the whirling itself.

607
00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:02.950
In order to whirl as we whirl and Medlavi's tradition

608
00:33:04.734 --> 00:33:08.631
one has to first of all

609
00:33:08.701 --> 00:33:11.699
be able to turn around a still axis

610
00:33:11.699 --> 00:33:13.415
which is the left leg.

611
00:33:13.415 --> 00:33:15.976
Whirling in our tradition

612
00:33:15.976 --> 00:33:20.082
requires the development

613
00:33:20.082 --> 00:33:23.218
of a certain capacity for attention

614
00:33:23.218 --> 00:33:25.724
so that a person can be turning on their left

615
00:33:25.724 --> 00:33:28.764
leg as the axis point.

616
00:33:28.764 --> 00:33:33.575
The right leg and foot takes steps

617
00:33:33.575 --> 00:33:36.380
which are 360 degrees.

618
00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:39.707
<v Woman>Does it have to be counterclockwise?</v>

619
00:33:39.707 --> 00:33:41.286
Is it always counterclockwise?

620
00:33:41.286 --> 00:33:42.845
<v ->It's always counterclockwise,</v>

621
00:33:44.855 --> 00:33:47.280
or it's almost always counterclockwise,

622
00:33:48.214 --> 00:33:50.860
and maybe that has something to do with

623
00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.413
the neutralizing of time.

624
00:33:53.483 --> 00:33:55.041
<v Woman>Yes, exactly.</v>

625
00:33:55.041 --> 00:33:57.014
I understand from a physics point of view

626
00:33:57.014 --> 00:33:59.083
we're looking at spiral dynamics really.

627
00:34:00.743 --> 00:34:02.549
<v ->I didn't know what physics would say about this,</v>

628
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:05.632
but our understanding is that to

629
00:34:05.632 --> 00:34:08.021
turn counterclockwise

630
00:34:08.021 --> 00:34:12.511
is to bring energies into this world

631
00:34:12.511 --> 00:34:13.877
as an act of service.

632
00:34:13.877 --> 00:34:15.199
<v Woman>It's a type of charging.</v>

633
00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:18.122
<v ->We're not doing this to take ourselves</v>

634
00:34:18.122 --> 00:34:20.799
out of the world or specifically to reach

635
00:34:20.799 --> 00:34:24.489
some ecstasy through the send.

636
00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:26.873
There really is an act of service,

637
00:34:27.017 --> 00:34:29.876
and in this act of service, you're turning

638
00:34:29.876 --> 00:34:33.587
with a group of people, so there's a choreography

639
00:34:33.587 --> 00:34:35.465
that one has to be aware of.

640
00:34:35.465 --> 00:34:39.048
There's also a heart relationship to the shape

641
00:34:39.048 --> 00:34:42.664
who is just standing there

642
00:34:42.664 --> 00:34:44.290
as the

643
00:34:45.619 --> 00:34:48.328
transmission point for the lineage

644
00:34:48.328 --> 00:34:51.069
holding a certain state of being

645
00:34:51.069 --> 00:34:54.141
which traces back to all generations

646
00:34:54.141 --> 00:34:57.341
of shapes and back to Rumi, and back to the prophet

647
00:34:57.341 --> 00:34:59.549
Mohammad, so there's a lineage.

648
00:34:59.549 --> 00:35:01.362
A shake whole set lineage.

649
00:35:01.362 --> 00:35:04.395
The dervishes who were whirling are

650
00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.185
doing their best to be in hard contact

651
00:35:07.185 --> 00:35:08.700
with that lineage.

652
00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.804
They have one hand up receiving,

653
00:35:11.804 --> 00:35:13.873
another hand down

654
00:35:13.873 --> 00:35:17.243
transmitting through the heart,

655
00:35:17.243 --> 00:35:22.243
and it's a meditation in motion.

656
00:35:23.024 --> 00:35:26.496
It is coming to our inmost center

657
00:35:26.502 --> 00:35:29.435
where we're closest to God and experiencing

658
00:35:29.435 --> 00:35:32.095
that intimacy, and

659
00:35:32.197 --> 00:35:35.210
it's also a joining in community.

660
00:35:35.322 --> 00:35:37.978
It's worship above all.

661
00:35:37.978 --> 00:35:40.090
It's reverencing the divine.

662
00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:42.868
It's an expression of

663
00:35:43.992 --> 00:35:45.801
beauty through a

664
00:35:46.297 --> 00:35:48.937
highly developed classical music,

665
00:35:49.028 --> 00:35:52.393
which gave birth to a great classical music tradition.

666
00:35:52.537 --> 00:35:54.899
It is also

667
00:35:57.912 --> 00:36:01.523
poetry is sung along with the music,

668
00:36:01.624 --> 00:36:05.528
and ultimately a person moves through stages

669
00:36:05.528 --> 00:36:08.195
of consciousness,

670
00:36:08.195 --> 00:36:13.187
deeper and deeper into that fifth stage of ecstatic union

671
00:36:13.187 --> 00:36:18.136
which is the third Salam, the third phase of movement,

672
00:36:18.136 --> 00:36:20.365
but then we come back into the fourth

673
00:36:20.365 --> 00:36:24.941
salam or phase which becomes very

674
00:36:24.941 --> 00:36:29.207
dignified, sober whirling

675
00:36:29.207 --> 00:36:31.852
where the person who is lost in a sense

676
00:36:31.852 --> 00:36:35.916
lost their individuality briefly

677
00:36:35.916 --> 00:36:39.916
during the third stage, comes back

678
00:36:39.916 --> 00:36:42.113
and is given their individuality back,

679
00:36:42.113 --> 00:36:46.597
in a sense in a new form, a new you,

680
00:36:46.625 --> 00:36:49.366
a new self is resurrected.

681
00:36:51.156 --> 00:36:54.965
There's that whole process, and then the ceremony ends.

682
00:36:54.965 --> 00:36:58.677
It ends at a point, all the dervishes

683
00:36:58.677 --> 00:37:00.000
will be turning.

684
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.765
The music will be reduced to one simple instrument

685
00:37:03.765 --> 00:37:07.775
improvising, and you hear the swishing of the robes

686
00:37:07.775 --> 00:37:10.794
and the feet and the silence and beautiful

687
00:37:10.794 --> 00:37:13.832
subtle improvisation, and then suddenly

688
00:37:13.832 --> 00:37:16.552
as if out of no where you hear

689
00:37:16.552 --> 00:37:20.195
the recitation of the Quran,

690
00:37:20.297 --> 00:37:23.614
and particularly this verse

691
00:37:23.614 --> 00:37:26.079
to God belongs the East and the West

692
00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:29.582
and wheresoever you turn is the face of God

693
00:37:29.727 --> 00:37:31.464
and at that moment all the dervishes

694
00:37:31.464 --> 00:37:32.686
stop.

695
00:37:33.417 --> 00:37:35.550
They put their hands over their shoulders.

696
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:37.822
They become the number one,

697
00:37:37.822 --> 00:37:39.587
the letter olif

698
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:42.889
to testify to the oneness of God,

699
00:37:42.889 --> 00:37:46.549
and they kneeled down on sheepskins

700
00:37:47.259 --> 00:37:51.997
and they are ready to listen with a pure heart

701
00:37:51.997 --> 00:37:54.067
to the Quran recitation.

702
00:37:54.067 --> 00:37:56.434
Everything leads up to that point.

703
00:37:56.434 --> 00:37:58.941
<v Woman>It's a very beautiful celebration.</v>

704
00:38:01.001 --> 00:38:04.103
Even though, I understood very little

705
00:38:04.103 --> 00:38:07.612
of what I was doing, as with most of the people

706
00:38:07.612 --> 00:38:08.658
that were there.

707
00:38:08.658 --> 00:38:10.610
We certainly could feel it by way

708
00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:11.601
of that transmission.

709
00:38:11.601 --> 00:38:13.787
it was absolutely lovely

710
00:38:13.787 --> 00:38:15.440
deepening experience.

711
00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.788
<v ->There is some objective phenomena</v>

712
00:38:17.788 --> 00:38:19.611
going on in the turning,

713
00:38:19.611 --> 00:38:22.053
and it's electromagnetic, because we are turning

714
00:38:22.053 --> 00:38:24.837
within the earth's electromagnetic field,

715
00:38:24.837 --> 00:38:27.952
and we are an electromagnet ourselves.

716
00:38:27.952 --> 00:38:29.786
<v Woman>It's a very pronounced feeling.</v>

717
00:38:29.786 --> 00:38:32.271
I found it very enlivening,

718
00:38:32.271 --> 00:38:36.143
very soothing and ecstatic all at the same time,

719
00:38:36.143 --> 00:38:37.520
and very mind expanding.

720
00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.397
It was lovely.

721
00:38:39.397 --> 00:38:42.000
Let me ask you this.

722
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.578
At this time,

723
00:38:43.578 --> 00:38:48.058
we have various belief systems that are

724
00:38:48.058 --> 00:38:51.236
calumniating in this sense of urgency

725
00:38:51.236 --> 00:38:55.470
in the Christian tradition it's a sense of

726
00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:58.296
an impending armageddon

727
00:38:58.296 --> 00:39:02.361
in the, for lack of a better word,

728
00:39:02.361 --> 00:39:04.238
I'll just say new age communities or metaphysical

729
00:39:04.238 --> 00:39:05.240
communities.

730
00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:08.441
It would be a focus on the coming date of 2012

731
00:39:08.441 --> 00:39:10.723
and the years surrounding that.

732
00:39:10.723 --> 00:39:13.410
Is there anything with the Islamic or

733
00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:16.547
Sufi tradition that is looking at these times

734
00:39:16.547 --> 00:39:19.864
as well as anything particularly unique?

735
00:39:21.965 --> 00:39:24.823
<v ->I'll speak from my own experience and perception</v>

736
00:39:24.823 --> 00:39:29.773
of this, because yes, there are end times,

737
00:39:29.773 --> 00:39:34.678
statements, and propositions in Islam,

738
00:39:34.678 --> 00:39:36.811
whether they're authentic or not

739
00:39:36.811 --> 00:39:41.462
can be debated, but let me also say that Islam

740
00:39:41.462 --> 00:39:45.494
and Sufism particularly always has a sense

741
00:39:45.494 --> 00:39:50.070
of the apocalyptic, in a sense that the unveiling

742
00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:53.856
that happened every moment as if the resurrection

743
00:39:53.856 --> 00:39:56.496
itself is possible here and now.

744
00:39:56.576 --> 00:39:58.378
We live in that reality.

745
00:39:58.378 --> 00:40:00.682
That is our everyday reality.

746
00:40:00.682 --> 00:40:04.213
At the same time, when we look at the sweep

747
00:40:04.213 --> 00:40:08.000
of history, and we look at what

748
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000
is undeniable, the changes humanity has gone through

749
00:40:13.567 --> 00:40:15.139
in the last

750
00:40:17.034 --> 00:40:20.883
100,000 years when human speech developed,

751
00:40:20.883 --> 00:40:25.064
and the last 26,000 years, which by the way,

752
00:40:25.064 --> 00:40:27.358
I don't know if anyones noticed or commented,

753
00:40:27.358 --> 00:40:30.194
but 26,000 years ago is when the first

754
00:40:30.194 --> 00:40:34.316
portraits of human beings appeared.

755
00:40:34.462 --> 00:40:35.837
<v Woman>I have not heard that.</v>

756
00:40:35.837 --> 00:40:38.599
I have heard of various kayvarts from 40,000

757
00:40:38.599 --> 00:40:40.199
years ago, but not specifically toward

758
00:40:40.199 --> 00:40:42.109
the portrait.

759
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.823
<v ->But they're not faces.</v>

760
00:40:42.823 --> 00:40:43.911
They're not portraits.

761
00:40:43.911 --> 00:40:47.751
26,000 years ago human beings

762
00:40:47.751 --> 00:40:50.280
reached a certain level

763
00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:54.599
of self-awareness, and we ourselves

764
00:40:54.599 --> 00:40:57.147
were introduced into a lineage that's

765
00:40:57.147 --> 00:40:59.570
actually 26,000 years old.

766
00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:01.799
It has an oral tradition 26,000 years old,

767
00:41:01.799 --> 00:41:05.415
and my teacher, I asked him, why 26,000 years?

768
00:41:05.415 --> 00:41:07.526
He looked at me like I was foolish

769
00:41:07.526 --> 00:41:09.435
and said, well we keep track,

770
00:41:09.435 --> 00:41:12.518
but later I realized that something happened then

771
00:41:12.518 --> 00:41:15.696
before I knew about the perception of the equinox

772
00:41:15.696 --> 00:41:16.817
I discovered on the cover

773
00:41:16.817 --> 00:41:19.258
of National Geographic a picture

774
00:41:19.258 --> 00:41:21.968
of the oldest known human face.

775
00:41:21.968 --> 00:41:23.568
It was 26,000 years.

776
00:41:23.568 --> 00:41:24.527
<v Woman>Very interesting.</v>

777
00:41:24.527 --> 00:41:27.749
<v ->Anyway, I'm laying out scales of time 26,000 years</v>

778
00:41:27.749 --> 00:41:29.776
sometimes been going on.

779
00:41:29.776 --> 00:41:33.924
5,000 years ago recorded history.

780
00:41:33.924 --> 00:41:38.757
A few hundred years ago to 50, 300 years ago

781
00:41:38.757 --> 00:41:41.870
industrialization, the shrinking of the world

782
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:43.395
with steamships.

783
00:41:43.395 --> 00:41:47.769
In more recent times the technology

784
00:41:47.769 --> 00:41:50.829
and particularly now the internet and the whole

785
00:41:50.829 --> 00:41:54.222
technosphere that we're involved with.

786
00:41:54.222 --> 00:41:56.546
Life has been incredibly intense

787
00:41:56.546 --> 00:41:59.560
in the last 11 years or so.

788
00:41:59.906 --> 00:42:02.467
For instance, a huge difference it seems,

789
00:42:04.113 --> 00:42:07.590
and even more so it seems in recent years.

790
00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:10.934
There's an intensification going on.

791
00:42:11.004 --> 00:42:14.812
It seems undeniable what it will lead to, I don't know,

792
00:42:14.812 --> 00:42:18.364
but I do experience the intensification.

793
00:42:18.364 --> 00:42:22.187
I have a sense that we're coming

794
00:42:22.288 --> 00:42:25.972
to a new sense of time

795
00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:29.583
just as in the Renaissance people

796
00:42:29.583 --> 00:42:33.391
developed a capacity for perspective in the

797
00:42:33.391 --> 00:42:37.609
three dimensional space we live in

798
00:42:37.872 --> 00:42:40.816
that we are opening up

799
00:42:40.816 --> 00:42:44.164
to something mystics have known and experienced,

800
00:42:44.164 --> 00:42:48.249
but a kind of perspective within time

801
00:42:48.249 --> 00:42:53.001
and a capacity to have a different relationship to time,

802
00:42:53.124 --> 00:42:58.124
and I also suspect that there is some shrinking

803
00:42:59.417 --> 00:43:03.758
between human intention and mind

804
00:43:03.758 --> 00:43:05.358
and manifestation.

805
00:43:05.358 --> 00:43:06.520
<v Woman>Yes, it would seem so.</v>

806
00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:08.653
<v ->That synchronicities are,</v>

807
00:43:08.653 --> 00:43:10.957
synchronicity dials are being turned up, and

808
00:43:10.957 --> 00:43:15.576
therefore, the significance

809
00:43:15.576 --> 00:43:17.528
of this to me is that it places

810
00:43:17.528 --> 00:43:20.076
at great responsibility on us

811
00:43:20.076 --> 00:43:23.437
to be aware

812
00:43:23.437 --> 00:43:26.732
and responsible for every thought and feeling,

813
00:43:26.732 --> 00:43:31.490
and so the spiritual solution here,

814
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:35.435
or the spiritual need for these times

815
00:43:35.435 --> 00:43:37.008
is to

816
00:43:37.825 --> 00:43:42.422
learn to rest in the divine,

817
00:43:42.422 --> 00:43:45.323
to trust the divine,

818
00:43:45.323 --> 00:43:48.278
to be so rooted in the divine

819
00:43:48.278 --> 00:43:51.616
that the intensification of time

820
00:43:51.616 --> 00:43:53.465
and the

821
00:43:54.006 --> 00:43:59.006
incredible bombardment with information

822
00:44:00.395 --> 00:44:03.689
and the intensity

823
00:44:03.689 --> 00:44:06.196
of life itself

824
00:44:06.196 --> 00:44:09.167
can be met

825
00:44:09.588 --> 00:44:13.070
from a still point within ourselves,

826
00:44:13.375 --> 00:44:17.390
and in that still point is

827
00:44:17.535 --> 00:44:20.083
to really find that still point

828
00:44:20.083 --> 00:44:22.312
it's not purely a mental phenomena.

829
00:44:22.312 --> 00:44:24.564
It's not something you just think about.

830
00:44:24.564 --> 00:44:29.564
It has something to do with trust in the divine,

831
00:44:30.621 --> 00:44:33.182
and surrender to the divine,

832
00:44:33.182 --> 00:44:38.182
and when we have that trust and surrender

833
00:44:38.663 --> 00:44:43.122
and we know that what we are is essentially

834
00:44:43.122 --> 00:44:48.122
infinite, pure spirit and love,

835
00:44:48.968 --> 00:44:53.100
then we can act from that

836
00:44:53.585 --> 00:44:54.647
truth,

837
00:44:55.239 --> 00:44:56.929
and we can

838
00:44:57.254 --> 00:45:01.366
be examples of sanity

839
00:45:01.511 --> 00:45:04.522
and balance and peace

840
00:45:04.592 --> 00:45:06.288
at a time when there are many

841
00:45:06.288 --> 00:45:08.415
reasons not to feel this way.

842
00:45:08.913 --> 00:45:12.159
<v Woman>That couldn't be put any more elegantly.</v>

843
00:45:12.422 --> 00:45:14.271
Very true.

844
00:45:14.277 --> 00:45:17.712
<v ->May the divine strengthen us</v>

845
00:45:17.712 --> 00:45:19.270
and guide us and

846
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:24.270
purify our intentions, and

847
00:45:25.295 --> 00:45:27.941
may the divine also make us capable

848
00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:33.235
of becoming a we

849
00:45:33.839 --> 00:45:35.252
at a time

850
00:45:36.004 --> 00:45:39.087
when there's much them and us,

851
00:45:39.087 --> 00:45:40.691
or I and me.

852
00:45:41.059 --> 00:45:44.708
Maybe know the truth of we as a race,

853
00:45:44.708 --> 00:45:49.406
as individuals, as spiritual seekers,

854
00:45:49.613 --> 00:45:52.306
as simply human beings.

855
00:45:52.749 --> 00:45:56.537
<v Woman>On that note, thank you so much for spending</v>

856
00:45:56.537 --> 00:45:59.769
time with us today and for adding clarity to something

857
00:45:59.769 --> 00:46:03.313
that has been so mysterious to most of us.

858
00:46:03.736 --> 00:46:05.379
<v ->Thank you for inviting me</v>

859
00:46:05.379 --> 00:46:10.321
and for conducting this very beautiful interview.

860
00:46:14.839 --> 00:46:17.527
<v ->To learn more about Sufism and Shaikh Helminski's work</v>

861
00:46:17.527 --> 00:46:19.597
you can go to sufism.com,

862
00:46:19.597 --> 00:46:22.017
and if you haven't already explored the profound poetry

863
00:46:22.017 --> 00:46:25.078
of Rumi, it's a magnificent glimpse into the connection

864
00:46:25.078 --> 00:46:26.306
with the divine.

865
00:46:26.306 --> 00:46:28.977
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
