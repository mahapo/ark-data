00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.149
<v ->I met Dr. Owen Flanagan after hearing his lecture</v>

2
00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.211
titled, "Is Happiness Possible?" at a happiness conference.

3
00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:09.231
He calls himself a Platonic hedonist,

4
00:00:09.231 --> 00:00:11.190
the emphasis on hedonist.

5
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.432
In fact, he says hedonism is misunderstood word,

6
00:00:14.432 --> 00:00:17.227
that it can help pave a path to happiness, in fact.

7
00:00:17.227 --> 00:00:19.200
He knows this, as he has had contact

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.312
with some of the brightest minds on the planet,

9
00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:23.072
including the Dalai Lama.

10
00:00:23.072 --> 00:00:26.858
In 1989, as a scholar on the subjects of Western psychology

11
00:00:26.858 --> 00:00:30.015
and philosophy, Owen was selected to educate

12
00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:33.748
the Dalai Lama as to the nature of emotions in the West.

13
00:00:33.748 --> 00:00:38.748 line:15% 
(relaxing piano music)

14
00:00:43.273 --> 00:00:44.777
<v Interviewer>I was listening to your talk</v>

15
00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:47.657
a little while ago and the question was,

16
00:00:47.657 --> 00:00:49.193
"Is happiness possible?"

17
00:00:49.193 --> 00:00:52.832
and you were specifically focusing on the West.

18
00:00:52.832 --> 00:00:55.039
How were you assigned this one?

19
00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.823
<v ->I think I was assigned it in 1999,</v>

20
00:00:57.823 --> 00:00:58.826
I had the same assignment.

21
00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:00.565
I was in Costa Rica and I got a phone call

22
00:01:00.565 --> 00:01:02.890
from my secretary at Duke saying that the

23
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.575
Dalai Lama wanted me to come over there

24
00:01:04.575 --> 00:01:07.455
and I said, "Yeah, a likely story," and my job there,

25
00:01:07.455 --> 00:01:09.801
in 1999 when I went over, was I did in fact have

26
00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:13.634
a real invitation, but my job was to teach

27
00:01:13.634 --> 00:01:16.750
the Dalai Lama about Western views about the emotions.

28
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.390
So I had no, at that time, involvement in Buddhism

29
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.873
or anything like, so I really went over there

30
00:01:24.873 --> 00:01:28.307
and talked to him about Western views about the emotions

31
00:01:28.307 --> 00:01:31.070
and especially the idea that we believe, in the West,

32
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.995
in retributive anger and things like that,

33
00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:36.339
that is unlike the East or at least--

34
00:01:36.339 --> 00:01:37.662
<v Interviewer>Was he surprised to hear this?</v>

35
00:01:37.662 --> 00:01:38.984
<v ->He kind of knew about it.</v>

36
00:01:38.984 --> 00:01:42.056
That's what my job was: to have an official degree

37
00:01:42.056 --> 00:01:44.701
that could tell him that, in fact, what he thought

38
00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:47.464
about Western views was true. (laughing)

39
00:01:47.464 --> 00:01:52.274
So that began a time when I sort of go among

40
00:01:52.274 --> 00:01:57.274
people, Buddhists, but also overseas a lot,

41
00:01:57.351 --> 00:02:00.540
I'm asked to talk about Western views about ethics

42
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.047
and happiness and things like that,

43
00:02:03.047 --> 00:02:04.881
so that's how I get assigned that

44
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:09.500
and Jinpa, since he's the Dalai Lama's English interpreter,

45
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.886
he always does the--

46
00:02:10.886 --> 00:02:11.868
<v Interviewer>Beautiful being.</v>

47
00:02:11.868 --> 00:02:13.329
<v Owen>Eastern things. He is a wonderful person.</v>

48
00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.390
<v Interviewer>And so, can you expand on how</v>

49
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.601
the Dalai Lama responded as you explained to him

50
00:02:19.601 --> 00:02:21.776
the nature of our psyche?

51
00:02:21.776 --> 00:02:24.282
<v ->Well, I told him things. I remember a few moments.</v>

52
00:02:24.282 --> 00:02:27.959
I said to him, here are two important moments

53
00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.286
in my conversations. One was when I said to him,

54
00:02:31.286 --> 00:02:33.740
I said, "Some people in the West, when they think

55
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.780
about human nature, think that we're either,

56
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.126
some people think that we're completely selfish

57
00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:42.334
like Thomas Hobbes did. So Hobbes said, "Life in the

58
00:02:42.334 --> 00:02:45.014
state of nature, if we let out our natural selves,

59
00:02:45.014 --> 00:02:47.425
is nasty, brutish and short, because there's a war

60
00:02:47.425 --> 00:02:50.091
of each against each. You're watching what I have

61
00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:52.096
and I'm watching what you have and I want what you have

62
00:02:52.096 --> 00:02:53.024
and you want what I have."

63
00:02:53.024 --> 00:02:58.024
So, I explained that to him and he had heard about that too.

64
00:02:58.827 --> 00:03:03.249
And then I said, a few people say that we're part egoist

65
00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:06.282
and partly compassionate, but no one

66
00:03:06.282 --> 00:03:09.674
ever has said in the West that we're innately compassionate

67
00:03:09.674 --> 00:03:12.479
like you said. Now he was a little bit surprised about that,

68
00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:14.474
although he did say, in response, he said,

69
00:03:14.474 --> 00:03:17.034
"Well I don't quite believe that we're really

70
00:03:17.034 --> 00:03:21.417
sort of innately nice. It's more that we have the capacity.

71
00:03:21.417 --> 00:03:23.132
<v Interviewer>And really, in the Buddhist way,</v>

72
00:03:23.132 --> 00:03:25.081
they expand on and they spend a great deal of time

73
00:03:25.081 --> 00:03:28.217
developing that capacity. Is that?

74
00:03:28.217 --> 00:03:31.257
<v ->Absolutely, yeah, so there's long traditions</v>

75
00:03:31.257 --> 00:03:33.742
in enhancing and growing that capacity

76
00:03:33.742 --> 00:03:36.486
and one interesting thing is, what's the arguement

77
00:03:36.486 --> 00:03:38.301
for growing that capacity as opposed to

78
00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:41.576
some other capacity, like in Chinese tradition,

79
00:03:41.576 --> 00:03:43.793
you'll get things like growing filial piety or

80
00:03:43.793 --> 00:03:46.387
respect for your elders and your family.

81
00:03:46.387 --> 00:03:48.297
We don't see that as much in something like Buddhism

82
00:03:48.297 --> 00:03:50.195
and you don't see the Buddhist emphasis

83
00:03:50.195 --> 00:03:52.403
on extreme compassion and loving-kindness

84
00:03:52.403 --> 00:03:56.606
in Western, say Greek, ethics. You just don't see it.

85
00:03:56.606 --> 00:03:59.187
<v Interviewer>And speaking of, when you were speaking</v>

86
00:03:59.187 --> 00:04:01.724
earlier today, you were talking about Aristotle's view,

87
00:04:01.724 --> 00:04:05.961
for example, of what a definition of happiness might be.

88
00:04:05.961 --> 00:04:07.678
And can you explain that a little bit, just so

89
00:04:07.678 --> 00:04:09.961
we can get a little better look at where we're coming from.

90
00:04:09.961 --> 00:04:14.142
<v ->Okay, so, there's this period that philosopher,</v>

91
00:04:14.142 --> 00:04:16.136
Karl Jasper, it's called the Axial Age.

92
00:04:16.136 --> 00:04:19.710
It's like, why all of a sudden do Plato and Aristotle

93
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.816
in Ancient Greece, Confucius and his students

94
00:04:23.816 --> 00:04:26.605
over in China, and the Buddha, what's going on

95
00:04:26.605 --> 00:04:28.909
in the 5th to 6th century BCE that these

96
00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:32.418
great wisdom traditions, possibly even the Hebrew Bible,

97
00:04:32.418 --> 00:04:34.199
some people will place around the same time.

98
00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:35.543
Give or take a hundred years, we're talking about

99
00:04:35.543 --> 00:04:36.845
a pretty exciting time.

100
00:04:36.845 --> 00:04:40.140
So, Aristotle, who's Plato's teacher.

101
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.490
I mean, Plato is his teacher, sorry.

102
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.921
and Socrates of course is Plato's teacher,

103
00:04:45.921 --> 00:04:49.665
so they're in a lineage. They seem to be the first people

104
00:04:49.665 --> 00:04:54.124
in the West to focus seriously on the possibility

105
00:04:54.124 --> 00:04:56.908
that there's something called, what we would

106
00:04:56.908 --> 00:04:59.809
now call happiness, that's in the cards for humans

107
00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:01.878
that doesn't depend on what

108
00:05:01.878 --> 00:05:04.619
god or gods have in store for you.

109
00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:07.936
So this is why I call Aristotle the first naturalist.

110
00:05:07.936 --> 00:05:10.933
He doesn't have a god in his view,

111
00:05:10.933 --> 00:05:13.877
but he has this idea that humans, just like acorns

112
00:05:13.877 --> 00:05:17.248
have in their future becoming an oak tree if they get lucky,

113
00:05:17.248 --> 00:05:22.248
plants have in their future growing to be

114
00:05:22.261 --> 00:05:24.031
a full, beautiful plant of whatever,

115
00:05:24.031 --> 00:05:26.005
so therein his question is, "What does

116
00:05:26.005 --> 00:05:30.011
a fully grown, fully developed human being become?"

117
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:32.102
And his idea is that we're animals

118
00:05:32.102 --> 00:05:34.128
that can grow reason and virtue

119
00:05:34.128 --> 00:05:37.349
and that if we grow those, then we are about

120
00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:39.188
as fulfilled as any person could be.

121
00:05:39.188 --> 00:05:42.274
So the word eudaimonia, with an eu- prefix,

122
00:05:42.274 --> 00:05:44.663
means happy, or it's usually translated

123
00:05:44.663 --> 00:05:47.308
as happy or positive.

124
00:05:47.308 --> 00:05:52.257
And then the -demon is a word for a spirit,

125
00:05:52.257 --> 00:05:55.084
so it's happy-spirited, although Aristotle's view

126
00:05:55.084 --> 00:05:57.107
didn't seem to involve, like, being overtaken

127
00:05:57.107 --> 00:06:01.160
by little sort of spirits. It was more the

128
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.813
state of your mind and character

129
00:06:02.813 --> 00:06:05.735
would be of the sort of a flourishing person.

130
00:06:05.735 --> 00:06:08.754
So, then the idea was. at least when I was a

131
00:06:08.754 --> 00:06:13.447
graduate student, we talked about happiness,

132
00:06:13.447 --> 00:06:15.442
eudaimonia being happiness. That's what people

133
00:06:15.442 --> 00:06:17.628
translated it as and then finally,

134
00:06:17.628 --> 00:06:19.740
in the mid-70s, people said, "Well, that might be

135
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.228
the wrong thing because we, Americans in particular,

136
00:06:23.228 --> 00:06:26.705
think about happiness as a subjective feeling state."

137
00:06:26.705 --> 00:06:28.064
<v Interviewer>Right, a mood.</v>

138
00:06:28.064 --> 00:06:31.008
<v ->A mood, and the idea is that no, maybe,</v>

139
00:06:31.008 --> 00:06:33.035
and what Aristotle didn't seem to have in mind

140
00:06:33.035 --> 00:06:35.051
was a mood state, although that's not bad

141
00:06:35.051 --> 00:06:35.680
if you're still--

142
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.141
<v Interviewer>He was looking more to human potentials.</v>

143
00:06:37.141 --> 00:06:38.250
<v ->He was looking to human potential.</v>

144
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.073
In fact, his whole theory is a theory about

145
00:06:40.073 --> 00:06:41.791
actualizing our potential, so he was like

146
00:06:41.791 --> 00:06:44.553
the first human development, human potential

147
00:06:44.553 --> 00:06:46.334
movement person, you could say.

148
00:06:46.334 --> 00:06:47.966
<v Interviewer>But at the same time, he,</v>

149
00:06:47.966 --> 00:06:51.891
as you were saying, has somewhat of an elitist view

150
00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:54.974
of this and can you talk about that for a moment.

151
00:06:54.974 --> 00:06:58.920
<v ->Right, yeah, so Aristotle talks about the view</v>

152
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.803
of, we need to know what eudeimonia is as conceived

153
00:07:02.803 --> 00:07:06.589
by experts, the few, not the many, because the many,

154
00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:09.746
the word hoi paloi means "the people" in Greek,

155
00:07:09.746 --> 00:07:11.880
so you don't want to just know what the hoi paloi think

156
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.479
'cause they'll tell you all kinds of stuff like,

157
00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:15.549
that it's money or it's reputation.

158
00:07:15.549 --> 00:07:19.378
And, Plato and Aristotle both, a lot of their discussions

159
00:07:19.378 --> 00:07:22.578
and dialogues and treatises are about the ordinary

160
00:07:22.578 --> 00:07:25.351
Greek conception of what makes people flourish

161
00:07:25.351 --> 00:07:28.177
and they're against that, so when Socrates

162
00:07:28.177 --> 00:07:33.177
has to die, one of his students comes and says,

163
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.588
"Let's get you out of jail, otherwise our

164
00:07:34.588 --> 00:07:35.868
reputation is going to suffer,"

165
00:07:35.868 --> 00:07:38.577
and Socrates says there, "You don't need to worry

166
00:07:38.577 --> 00:07:40.603
about what ordinary people think about

167
00:07:40.603 --> 00:07:42.739
our reputation, we only need to worry about

168
00:07:42.739 --> 00:07:44.567
what the other experts think."

169
00:07:44.567 --> 00:07:47.306
So philosophy is filled with people who have

170
00:07:47.306 --> 00:07:51.734
sort of elitist attitudes. Now, the problem is,

171
00:07:51.734 --> 00:07:53.738
well the question is, is that a problem?

172
00:07:53.738 --> 00:07:57.130
Do ordinary people, is it a question about

173
00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.519
that everyone has a right to answer, namely

174
00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:02.399
what makes for a good life? Or are there some experts?

175
00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:04.351
And you see this again and again in philosophy.

176
00:08:04.351 --> 00:08:07.529
So John Stuart Mill in the 19th century,

177
00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:10.249
he says if you're wondering about two courses of action,

178
00:08:10.249 --> 00:08:12.819
ask the expert who's done both and trust the

179
00:08:12.819 --> 00:08:15.774
expert more than the person who's never tried both.

180
00:08:15.774 --> 00:08:19.064
So, but Aristotle's idea is that there are, like

181
00:08:19.064 --> 00:08:22.184
having excellent friendships, he divided friendships

182
00:08:22.184 --> 00:08:25.582
into three types. There were friendships of utility.

183
00:08:25.582 --> 00:08:28.547
That's like what you have with people you do business with.

184
00:08:28.547 --> 00:08:29.987
Those don't survive if you have

185
00:08:29.987 --> 00:08:31.960
no other reason to do business.

186
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.893
There are friendships of pleasure, like just

187
00:08:34.893 --> 00:08:36.770
sexual relationship, and then there are

188
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.232
true friendships where you love the other

189
00:08:38.232 --> 00:08:40.024
as another self and Aristotle says again and again,

190
00:08:40.024 --> 00:08:42.274
most people don't know about true friendship,

191
00:08:42.274 --> 00:08:44.013
but it's better.

192
00:08:44.013 --> 00:08:46.178
And you can say, the argument would be,

193
00:08:46.178 --> 00:08:49.100
I've had all three, and trust me, the handful of

194
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.498
true friendships are the best.

195
00:08:50.498 --> 00:08:52.044
<v Interviewer>I know this is something that has emerged</v>

196
00:08:52.044 --> 00:08:55.628
throughout this conference, happiness and its causes,

197
00:08:55.628 --> 00:08:57.505
is this notion of true friendship.

198
00:08:57.505 --> 00:09:00.311
If we go, let's for a moment, before we go further into

199
00:09:00.311 --> 00:09:04.652
that, we go to Plato, and this is where the notion

200
00:09:04.652 --> 00:09:08.609
of truth and beauty and goodness starts coming into play.

201
00:09:08.609 --> 00:09:13.609
<v ->Right, yeah, so Plato starts off this whole idea</v>

202
00:09:13.622 --> 00:09:16.662
and people talk about Plato having these ideal forms

203
00:09:16.662 --> 00:09:19.659
and Plato's heaven, there's the good, the true

204
00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:22.443
and the beautiful. So one way I like to think about it is

205
00:09:22.443 --> 00:09:27.443
that Plato at least proposes the idea that

206
00:09:27.946 --> 00:09:30.549
moral goodness, that's how I think of goodness,

207
00:09:30.549 --> 00:09:34.165
like being a really good person, going for

208
00:09:34.165 --> 00:09:37.279
aesthetic pleasures, those could be pleasures of the body,

209
00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:39.882
pleasures of art, pleasures of music,

210
00:09:39.882 --> 00:09:42.570
and the pleasures of science, that's the true.

211
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:44.681
So think of science as what tells us

212
00:09:44.681 --> 00:09:47.188
the truth about the world. That's where I bring in

213
00:09:47.188 --> 00:09:48.607
Darwin and neuroscience because

214
00:09:48.607 --> 00:09:51.817
I think that's our best theories that we have right now

215
00:09:51.817 --> 00:09:55.390
about our nature is the view we get from Charles Darwin

216
00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.481
who says that we're just animals.

217
00:09:57.481 --> 00:09:58.569
We're very sophisticated animals,

218
00:09:58.569 --> 00:10:00.542
but we're animals at the end of the day.

219
00:10:00.542 --> 00:10:03.123
Neuroscience says the site of the mind

220
00:10:03.123 --> 00:10:07.464
is in the brain, so we get there on the truthful side.

221
00:10:07.464 --> 00:10:11.624
We get our views about beauty and so on and so forth.

222
00:10:11.624 --> 00:10:12.968
<v Interviewer>That's more transcendent though, really,</v>

223
00:10:12.968 --> 00:10:14.941
when you get into the notions of beauty.

224
00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:17.170
<v ->Well, it is, I don't know if it's transcendent, I mean</v>

225
00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.514
this is where I come from is sort of,

226
00:10:18.514 --> 00:10:19.997
this is the naturalist image.

227
00:10:19.997 --> 00:10:22.087
I think we have ideas about what gives pleasure.

228
00:10:22.087 --> 00:10:25.341
I think of beauty actually as the science of

229
00:10:25.341 --> 00:10:27.591
what are the best pleasures, okay.

230
00:10:27.591 --> 00:10:29.916
Now it might get transcendent, but here's my ideal:

231
00:10:29.916 --> 00:10:33.052
It would be nice, this is where what I call

232
00:10:33.052 --> 00:10:35.089
Platonistic hedonism comes in,

233
00:10:35.089 --> 00:10:38.534
I think the best life to live is a life where you

234
00:10:38.534 --> 00:10:42.481
seek out the truth, the good, and the beautiful,

235
00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:44.913
and I like to think that those could go together,

236
00:10:44.913 --> 00:10:47.142
but a lot of people tell me all the time,

237
00:10:47.142 --> 00:10:50.395
people who buy into certain religious beliefs, for example,

238
00:10:50.395 --> 00:10:53.712
that no, the truth is a problem.

239
00:10:53.712 --> 00:10:55.273
People don't want to know the truth,

240
00:10:55.273 --> 00:10:57.225
and this is an interesting question. You see--

241
00:10:57.225 --> 00:10:58.526
<v Interviewer>And what about the pleasures?</v>

242
00:10:58.526 --> 00:11:00.435
<v ->Well the pleasure is, some people say pleasures are bad</v>

243
00:11:00.435 --> 00:11:02.078
and I think that they're making a mistake.

244
00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:05.864
I think some people overrate the ethical, the

245
00:11:05.864 --> 00:11:07.955
giving to other people part of life.

246
00:11:07.955 --> 00:11:10.482
I think that, you know, there's a kind of a life,

247
00:11:10.482 --> 00:11:12.712
at least the life I choose is a life in balance

248
00:11:12.712 --> 00:11:14.290
where I seek all these things together.

249
00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.586
Now, some other people would say, "Well, when it comes to

250
00:11:17.586 --> 00:11:22.066
pleasure, the aesthetic dimension, against doing good,

251
00:11:22.066 --> 00:11:25.650
wouldn't a eudaimon, a flourishing person,

252
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:26.738
always choose the ethical?"

253
00:11:26.738 --> 00:11:29.201
I'm not so sure. I don't think it's clearcut

254
00:11:29.201 --> 00:11:30.385
what you should choose.

255
00:11:30.385 --> 00:11:32.305
<v Interviewer>And there's a lot of debate about that here.</v>

256
00:11:32.305 --> 00:11:34.310
<v ->There's a lot, I don't know if there's too much</v>

257
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:35.910
debate here. I think at least, well among my friends

258
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:39.185
on my panel, that the view is that to be happy,

259
00:11:39.185 --> 00:11:42.918
you have to be the ethical has the priority

260
00:11:42.918 --> 00:11:45.755
and there's a big debate in philosophy, goes back.

261
00:11:45.755 --> 00:11:48.838
Kierkegaard had this sort of question of either, or.

262
00:11:48.838 --> 00:11:50.416
Aren't there just two different lives, the life,

263
00:11:50.416 --> 00:11:51.771
I mean, what's a better life?

264
00:11:51.771 --> 00:11:56.771
Picasso, Goghan, or the life of Mother Teresa?

265
00:11:57.499 --> 00:11:59.749
I go for Picasso and Goghan any day of the week,

266
00:11:59.749 --> 00:12:01.285
but that just tells you about my preferences.

267
00:12:01.285 --> 00:12:02.544
<v Interviewer>You call yourself a</v>

268
00:12:02.544 --> 00:12:05.167
Platonic Darwinian hedonist. (laughing)

269
00:12:05.167 --> 00:12:07.226
<v ->Right, well, I actually mostly call myself</v>

270
00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:09.903
a Platonic hedonist, but the idea is that

271
00:12:09.903 --> 00:12:11.802
the pleasures I seek, and I think we're all

272
00:12:11.802 --> 00:12:13.775
pleasure-seeking animals, so that's the Darwinian part,

273
00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:17.977
we're animals, involved what I like to think

274
00:12:17.977 --> 00:12:21.743
could be the intersection of those three things together,

275
00:12:21.743 --> 00:12:24.804
but people tell me that I'm naive,

276
00:12:24.804 --> 00:12:26.596
that most people don't want to know the truth.

277
00:12:26.596 --> 00:12:29.033
I think that's an interesting empirical question.

278
00:12:29.033 --> 00:12:30.398
<v Interviewer>That is, indeed.</v>

279
00:12:30.398 --> 00:12:35.398
When we look at this, it is another subject that you

280
00:12:35.582 --> 00:12:39.496
brought up earlier, was the luxury of having

281
00:12:39.496 --> 00:12:42.312
the space and the time, the clear mental space even,

282
00:12:42.312 --> 00:12:45.096
for the pursuit of happiness.

283
00:12:45.096 --> 00:12:49.629
There's a certain threshold at which a person has to

284
00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:52.675
achieve before this is even really an option in life.

285
00:12:52.675 --> 00:12:54.371
Can you talk a little bit about that?

286
00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:57.848
<v ->Sure. According to the most recent statistics</v>

287
00:12:57.848 --> 00:13:02.541
of the World Bank, 25% of the people in the world

288
00:13:02.541 --> 00:13:05.283
live in a condition called absolute poverty.

289
00:13:05.283 --> 00:13:09.485
No one in America has to live in a situation

290
00:13:09.485 --> 00:13:11.085
of absolute poverty. Some people who are on

291
00:13:11.085 --> 00:13:14.615
streets who are severely ill will sometimes

292
00:13:14.615 --> 00:13:16.909
find themselves in the equivalent of a situation,

293
00:13:16.909 --> 00:13:21.538
but there are social safety net structures in place.

294
00:13:21.538 --> 00:13:24.087
Soup kitchens or housing.

295
00:13:24.087 --> 00:13:26.060
But for one in four people on Earth,

296
00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.727
that's one point three or four billion people,

297
00:13:28.727 --> 00:13:30.870
they don't have the basic necessities of life

298
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.049
and I think this is actually an area in which

299
00:13:34.049 --> 00:13:39.049
people, Westerners, we're nation-state chauvinists.

300
00:13:40.246 --> 00:13:45.099
So when we do worry about the wellbeing of other people,

301
00:13:45.099 --> 00:13:48.416
it tends not to go beyond the borders of our country

302
00:13:48.416 --> 00:13:50.645
and I think we see this again and again and again.

303
00:13:50.645 --> 00:13:52.928
Sometimes there are practical reasons only to worry

304
00:13:52.928 --> 00:13:55.157
about the other people in your country

305
00:13:55.157 --> 00:13:57.685
and some people say, well, if you see someone

306
00:13:57.685 --> 00:13:59.616
who's really suffering, then do something.

307
00:13:59.616 --> 00:14:01.749
But there are philosophers I know, for example,

308
00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:04.159
philosopher Peter Singer of Princeton,

309
00:14:04.159 --> 00:14:07.317
he gives up 50 to 60% of his income to

310
00:14:07.317 --> 00:14:11.711
poor and he thinks that that's a moral duty

311
00:14:11.711 --> 00:14:13.215
we all have and if we were paying attention,

312
00:14:13.215 --> 00:14:16.905
we would all do it and he's a, what we call in philosophy,

313
00:14:16.905 --> 00:14:18.580
a utilitarian. He believes that your

314
00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.372
moral responsibility is to promote

315
00:14:20.372 --> 00:14:21.641
the greatest amount of happiness

316
00:14:21.641 --> 00:14:23.529
for the greatest number of people in the long run.

317
00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:25.524
That's a kind of hedonism as far as I'm concerned.

318
00:14:25.524 --> 00:14:27.006
Hedonism has a bad name.

319
00:14:27.006 --> 00:14:30.238
People will say, "Oh hedonists, all they care about

320
00:14:30.238 --> 00:14:31.486
are momentary pleasures."

321
00:14:31.486 --> 00:14:34.046
No, there are hedonists who care

322
00:14:34.046 --> 00:14:35.294
about long-standing pleasures.

323
00:14:35.294 --> 00:14:37.854
Michelangelo, you could call him a hedonist, right?

324
00:14:37.854 --> 00:14:39.774
He was willing to really give what it took

325
00:14:39.774 --> 00:14:43.165
to paint the Sistine Chapel and to have that creative,

326
00:14:43.165 --> 00:14:46.493
the pleasure that he gained from doing that.

327
00:14:46.493 --> 00:14:51.133
So I think a lot of great artists are hedonists in my sense,

328
00:14:51.133 --> 00:14:52.925
non in the sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll sense.

329
00:14:52.925 --> 00:14:55.058
<v Interviewer>So, give us a very succinct definition</v>

330
00:14:55.058 --> 00:14:56.871
of hedonism from your view.

331
00:14:56.871 --> 00:14:58.858
<v ->Well, hedonism means literally--</v>

332
00:14:58.858 --> 00:15:00.340
<v Interviewer>From your view.</v>

333
00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.548
<v ->Well, from my view is well, that, hedonism</v>

334
00:15:02.548 --> 00:15:03.753
just is the pursuit of pleasure.

335
00:15:03.753 --> 00:15:05.213
Then the question is, "What kinds of pleasures

336
00:15:05.213 --> 00:15:06.280
are the good ones to seek?"

337
00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.168
And I think that there are heirachies of pleasures,

338
00:15:08.168 --> 00:15:11.506
so I think that momentary pleasures,

339
00:15:11.506 --> 00:15:13.138
just in virtue of being momentary,

340
00:15:13.138 --> 00:15:15.943
are not as satisfying as long-term pleasures.

341
00:15:15.943 --> 00:15:17.404
What kind of long-term pleasures are there?

342
00:15:17.404 --> 00:15:18.940
Well, there are the long-term pleasures of

343
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.212
true friendship, loving the other as a self.

344
00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:24.273
Having Paul Ekman today talking about that

345
00:15:24.273 --> 00:15:29.273
concept from Yiddish, nachas, was the thing,

346
00:15:30.492 --> 00:15:33.532
but it's like the desire of each generation

347
00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:35.548
to create a future generation,

348
00:15:35.548 --> 00:15:38.055
the pleasures of knowing that, in some sense,

349
00:15:38.055 --> 00:15:43.055
your spirit goes on in children or the next generation.

350
00:15:43.537 --> 00:15:44.582
It doesn't have to be one's own children,

351
00:15:44.582 --> 00:15:45.606
but it could be the next generation,

352
00:15:45.606 --> 00:15:48.347
knowing that one is doing well to make a world

353
00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:50.640
a pleasant place for the next generation.

354
00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.542
So I think people in America are kind of prudish

355
00:15:53.542 --> 00:15:55.846
about pleasures, but it's because we associate

356
00:15:55.846 --> 00:15:57.840
pleasure with all the pleasures

357
00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.184
that just aren't that interesting.

358
00:15:59.184 --> 00:16:01.765
<v Interviewer>Right, rather than, as you say, a higher</v>

359
00:16:01.765 --> 00:16:04.250
pursuit, say as, what you were saying Peter Singer

360
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:07.472
is offering the world, which is, it is his pleasure to

361
00:16:07.472 --> 00:16:10.309
donate 50, 60% of his salary to

362
00:16:10.309 --> 00:16:11.653
end the suffering of other people.

363
00:16:11.653 --> 00:16:12.517
<v ->Yeah, exactly right--</v>

364
00:16:12.517 --> 00:16:13.583
<v Interviewer>And so that goes back into</v>

365
00:16:13.583 --> 00:16:15.002
truth, beauty and goodness.

366
00:16:15.002 --> 00:16:15.951
<v Owen>That's right--</v>

367
00:16:15.951 --> 00:16:16.644
<v Interviewer>It feeds back--</v>

368
00:16:16.644 --> 00:16:17.807
<v Owen>Well that's what I think about it as,</v>

369
00:16:17.807 --> 00:16:19.204
in other words, it's not a...

370
00:16:19.204 --> 00:16:23.769
You know, there is like, I say to my students,

371
00:16:23.769 --> 00:16:27.534
I say well, "If the class was divided into 50% of you

372
00:16:27.534 --> 00:16:30.276
were sadists and 50% of you were masochists,

373
00:16:30.276 --> 00:16:32.388
then you could have a local sadomasochist club

374
00:16:32.388 --> 00:16:34.777
and that would be pleasant, and it's true.

375
00:16:34.777 --> 00:16:37.081
I mean, they would both be getting pleasure.

376
00:16:37.081 --> 00:16:39.299
The question is, is that the kind of pleasure

377
00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:40.456
you want to seek day and night?

378
00:16:40.456 --> 00:16:41.896
Well, probably not, even if you're a sadomasochist,

379
00:16:41.896 --> 00:16:45.032
or a sadist and a masochist, that isn't the kind of pleasure

380
00:16:45.032 --> 00:16:47.207
that is really pleasant for the long run,

381
00:16:47.207 --> 00:16:49.746
or at least it has its place, possibly, but

382
00:16:49.746 --> 00:16:52.455
it's not going to be like being around excellent music

383
00:16:52.455 --> 00:16:54.940
or excellent art or excellent philosophy

384
00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.284
or excellent mathematics.

385
00:16:56.284 --> 00:16:58.865
I mean, these are quirky things, it's like

386
00:16:58.865 --> 00:17:01.649
Darren this morning was talking about the word

387
00:17:01.649 --> 00:17:04.551
for happy comes from the word for luck.

388
00:17:04.551 --> 00:17:06.854
These are things that mother nature,

389
00:17:06.854 --> 00:17:09.265
this is where the Darwinism gets complicated,

390
00:17:09.265 --> 00:17:11.291
mother nature didn't care that we'd be good

391
00:17:11.291 --> 00:17:14.513
at all these things that we turn out to be good at,

392
00:17:14.513 --> 00:17:16.678
but they do give us high pleasures.

393
00:17:16.678 --> 00:17:21.040
And, it seems to me, given the fact that,

394
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.598
this is where the Darwinism comes in,

395
00:17:22.598 --> 00:17:24.453
given the fact that there's no reason to believe

396
00:17:24.453 --> 00:17:27.984
that we individually go on beyond our lifespan,

397
00:17:27.984 --> 00:17:31.098
everybody thinks who's a serious biologist,

398
00:17:31.098 --> 00:17:33.765
that the human species will be extinct someday.

399
00:17:33.765 --> 00:17:36.826
So then the question is, well, what do we live for?

400
00:17:36.826 --> 00:17:39.546
And it seems to me that we live for some kind of,

401
00:17:39.546 --> 00:17:41.658
both in our own lifetime, the rules change.

402
00:17:41.658 --> 00:17:44.794
We live for a certain kind of self-development,

403
00:17:44.794 --> 00:17:46.394
cultivation of ourselves as the

404
00:17:46.394 --> 00:17:48.975
best creatures we can be, seeding for the

405
00:17:48.975 --> 00:17:50.639
future generations of humans, but also

406
00:17:50.639 --> 00:17:53.060
seeding for the future of the world and

407
00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.126
that's all we can do.

408
00:17:54.126 --> 00:17:56.420
The cosmos will go on, probably, after we're gone, but.

409
00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.913
<v Interviewer>Likely.</v>

410
00:17:57.913 --> 00:17:59.161
<v ->Likely, yeah.</v>

411
00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:00.793
<v Interviewer>How do you view this in</v>

412
00:18:00.793 --> 00:18:03.481
very contemporary terms when we're looking at

413
00:18:03.481 --> 00:18:07.598
a vast portion of the planet has really

414
00:18:07.598 --> 00:18:10.840
stepped headlong into materialism,

415
00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.355
deeply into materialism, and now we're

416
00:18:12.355 --> 00:18:14.787
watching that world change with the global recession,

417
00:18:14.787 --> 00:18:17.997
if not depression, looming and unfolding before us.

418
00:18:17.997 --> 00:18:21.505
What are you seeing in terms of the value of asking

419
00:18:21.505 --> 00:18:23.990
these questions about happiness and fulfillment

420
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.752
in light of what's going on around us right now?

421
00:18:26.752 --> 00:18:30.219
<v ->Well, I think that one thing we know from some of</v>

422
00:18:30.219 --> 00:18:34.027
the research that I have written about recently,

423
00:18:34.027 --> 00:18:36.320
I think I mentioned it this morning, that

424
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:41.320
material goods over above a certain threshold,

425
00:18:43.082 --> 00:18:45.361
don't bring much of an increase in happiness.

426
00:18:45.361 --> 00:18:47.985
Now, they do bring some increase, actually.

427
00:18:47.985 --> 00:18:49.883
So, but--

428
00:18:49.883 --> 00:18:51.675
<v Interviewer>It was rather marginal.</v>

429
00:18:51.675 --> 00:18:54.086
<v ->$10,000, about $10,000 then it's like</v>

430
00:18:54.086 --> 00:18:55.696
not a lot that's added by amount--

431
00:18:55.696 --> 00:18:57.296
<v Interviewer>Over 10,000, which is--</v>

432
00:18:57.296 --> 00:18:59.056
<v ->Yeah, across the world, which is way below</v>

433
00:18:59.056 --> 00:19:01.104
poverty level in America. It's way below, so

434
00:19:01.104 --> 00:19:05.722
the, I guess the idea would be that you don't

435
00:19:05.722 --> 00:19:09.968
find a big increment once you get above about $10,000.

436
00:19:09.968 --> 00:19:12.335
You need the, that's the level of absolute poverty, in--

437
00:19:12.335 --> 00:19:13.295
<v Interviewer>Were you surprised to find</v>

438
00:19:13.295 --> 00:19:15.130
that threshold was that low?

439
00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:17.914
<v ->I wasn't. Well, I've been watching this</v>

440
00:19:17.914 --> 00:19:20.186
research for a long time, so I guess I wasn't surprised,

441
00:19:20.186 --> 00:19:24.558
but I don't remember when I first learned it, but the--

442
00:19:24.558 --> 00:19:26.744
<v Interviewer>But that's wonderful, that's wonderful to--</v>

443
00:19:26.744 --> 00:19:30.968
<v ->It's important to know so that what is a little bit</v>

444
00:19:30.968 --> 00:19:34.008
of a pathology that we have in the West about always

445
00:19:34.008 --> 00:19:35.729
increase, increase, increase--

446
00:19:35.729 --> 00:19:36.540
<v Interviewer>A 20% increase--</v>

447
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.609
<v ->A 20% increase in salary or just keep the world</v>

448
00:19:38.609 --> 00:19:40.252
being more and more productive, or we need it

449
00:19:40.252 --> 00:19:41.713
to be more and more productive.

450
00:19:41.713 --> 00:19:43.644
I mean, there comes a time where we're seeing it

451
00:19:43.644 --> 00:19:44.731
with the environmental problems.

452
00:19:44.731 --> 00:19:48.987
There's diminishing returns on what we're doing.

453
00:19:48.987 --> 00:19:50.768
<v Interviewer>And the appetite is insatiable. Doesn't it--</v>

454
00:19:50.768 --> 00:19:53.190
<v ->Well this is what's always been interesting to me:</v>

455
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:57.253
Thomas Hobbes, in chapter 13 of his great book Leviathan,

456
00:19:57.253 --> 00:19:59.504
people always read Hobbes as saying this,

457
00:19:59.504 --> 00:20:04.026
"If people have the same desires for material things

458
00:20:04.026 --> 00:20:05.861
and they have the same abilities to get them,

459
00:20:05.861 --> 00:20:08.282
and there's scarcity, then there will be conflict."

460
00:20:08.282 --> 00:20:10.746
So some people think, well, "Let's get rid of the scarcity

461
00:20:10.746 --> 00:20:11.599
and then there won't be conflict,"

462
00:20:11.599 --> 00:20:13.840
but there is this possibility that humans'

463
00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.364
desires are insatiable, as you say.

464
00:20:15.364 --> 00:20:17.412
Then you don't need external scarcity.

465
00:20:17.412 --> 00:20:19.033
It just has to be that you have more than I do

466
00:20:19.033 --> 00:20:22.798
and then, my nature alone will put us into competition.

467
00:20:22.798 --> 00:20:25.166
I don't think this is an impossible view about humans.

468
00:20:25.166 --> 00:20:27.331
In other words, this is where I think that

469
00:20:27.331 --> 00:20:29.016
I take the science very seriously.

470
00:20:29.016 --> 00:20:30.947
I look at what psychologists, neuroscientists,

471
00:20:30.947 --> 00:20:32.899
and evolutionary biologists say.

472
00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:34.179
We're not made by angels.

473
00:20:34.179 --> 00:20:37.795
We're made like other mammals and

474
00:20:37.795 --> 00:20:41.165
that makes us quirky and--

475
00:20:41.165 --> 00:20:42.189
<v Interviewer>Still have a little bit</v>

476
00:20:42.189 --> 00:20:43.650
of that competitive--

477
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:46.551
<v ->Well, we're kind of mixed bags from a moral point of view.</v>

478
00:20:46.551 --> 00:20:48.663
I mean, there's a lot of great wisdom literature out there.

479
00:20:48.663 --> 00:20:51.426
There's a Chinese philosopher, who I love, named

480
00:20:51.426 --> 00:20:53.986
Hsun Tzu and he has a title of

481
00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:56.930
a chapter called "People Are Bad." (laughing)

482
00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:01.169
Well, that's kind of extreme, but we're very plastic.

483
00:21:01.169 --> 00:21:02.417
This is the thing about the neuroplasticity--

484
00:21:02.417 --> 00:21:03.227
<v Interviewer>I was just going to ask you that.</v>

485
00:21:03.227 --> 00:21:04.507
You're an optimist because of this.

486
00:21:04.507 --> 00:21:06.086
Let's talk about neuroplasticity.

487
00:21:06.086 --> 00:21:09.083
<v ->Yeah, well, the research show, I again wasn't</v>

488
00:21:09.083 --> 00:21:11.717
really surprised by this 'cause I've been studying

489
00:21:11.717 --> 00:21:14.245
mind science for a long time, but

490
00:21:14.245 --> 00:21:15.738
we know people can learn.

491
00:21:15.738 --> 00:21:17.551
We know people can change.

492
00:21:17.551 --> 00:21:19.663
How much we can change our nature

493
00:21:19.663 --> 00:21:22.234
is an interesting question.

494
00:21:22.234 --> 00:21:25.049
We know we can change it a lot by prostheses.

495
00:21:25.049 --> 00:21:30.049
So, for example, in 1600, lenses were

496
00:21:30.553 --> 00:21:32.729
basically just being in invented,

497
00:21:32.729 --> 00:21:35.268
so I can't read without eyeglasses.

498
00:21:35.268 --> 00:21:38.051
I might be an illiterate person if it wasn't for eyeglasses,

499
00:21:38.051 --> 00:21:41.859
so eyeglasses have extended my consciousness

500
00:21:41.859 --> 00:21:43.555
in some important sense.

501
00:21:43.555 --> 00:21:45.507
We know that our iPhones and computers

502
00:21:45.507 --> 00:21:47.736
have externalized our memories,

503
00:21:47.736 --> 00:21:49.656
so those are just technological ways, to,

504
00:21:49.656 --> 00:21:51.893
as it were, maybe enhance ourselves,

505
00:21:51.893 --> 00:21:53.844
but maybe, some people say, "Well, that's a

506
00:21:53.844 --> 00:21:54.826
diminishment of ourselves."

507
00:21:54.826 --> 00:21:58.879
Meanwhile, it was thought, until about 20 years ago,

508
00:21:58.879 --> 00:22:01.321
that brain cells only die as you get older.

509
00:22:01.321 --> 00:22:04.553
Now there's plenty of evidence that some are regenerated,

510
00:22:04.553 --> 00:22:06.526
but even if they're not regenerated

511
00:22:06.526 --> 00:22:09.054
at the same rate as they die.

512
00:22:09.054 --> 00:22:10.452
That's the bad news.

513
00:22:10.452 --> 00:22:13.534
But, making neuronal connections, new connections

514
00:22:13.534 --> 00:22:17.950
among circuits is entirely possible.

515
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:19.710
Now the question is, and we know

516
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:20.734
we're doing this all the time.

517
00:22:20.734 --> 00:22:22.238
If you play a musical instrument, you're doing it.

518
00:22:22.238 --> 00:22:23.635
If you play tennis, you're doing it.

519
00:22:23.635 --> 00:22:25.469
If you study anything, you're doing it.

520
00:22:25.469 --> 00:22:26.355
<v Interviewer>Foreign languages, you're doing it?</v>

521
00:22:26.355 --> 00:22:27.283
<v ->Foreign languages, you're doing it.</v>

522
00:22:27.283 --> 00:22:29.928
There's now a lot of focus on the effects

523
00:22:29.928 --> 00:22:32.157
of these contemplative techniques and

524
00:22:32.157 --> 00:22:34.802
we'll see how that pans out.

525
00:22:34.802 --> 00:22:37.031
I've done a lot of research on this

526
00:22:37.031 --> 00:22:41.447
and, in fact, I published an article in May of 2003

527
00:22:41.447 --> 00:22:43.143
in the New Scientist saying that there had been

528
00:22:43.143 --> 00:22:45.159
one person studied, a Buddhist contemplative

529
00:22:45.159 --> 00:22:48.238
who I know, and that his brain lit up

530
00:22:48.238 --> 00:22:50.980
more in the happiness department than other people

531
00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.420
and I said this was tantalizing.

532
00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.094
The next morning were my 15 Warhol

533
00:22:54.094 --> 00:22:56.227
minutes of fame because I got called

534
00:22:56.227 --> 00:22:57.977
from the Associated Press, Reuters,

535
00:22:57.977 --> 00:22:59.385
Canadian Broadcasting System.

536
00:22:59.385 --> 00:23:00.803
The all asked me how did I discover

537
00:23:00.803 --> 00:23:02.851
the happiness center in Buddhist brains?

538
00:23:02.851 --> 00:23:05.816
So, and, it was preposterous.

539
00:23:05.816 --> 00:23:10.816
The data aren't just there yet to show that

540
00:23:11.139 --> 00:23:13.016
any particular practices, but, as you said,

541
00:23:13.016 --> 00:23:15.896
anything we do reconfigures our brains.

542
00:23:15.896 --> 00:23:19.106
That, but, I--

543
00:23:19.106 --> 00:23:20.631
<v Interviewer>That leads us to be hopeful.</v>

544
00:23:20.631 --> 00:23:22.658
<v ->It leads us to be hopeful, but I actually still</v>

545
00:23:22.658 --> 00:23:25.698
personally think the place to look for the changes

546
00:23:25.698 --> 00:23:28.898
that we need are in the external world, in social practices.

547
00:23:28.898 --> 00:23:29.548
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

548
00:23:29.548 --> 00:23:32.983
<v ->That's, because that's what changes the brains the most.</v>

549
00:23:32.983 --> 00:23:36.257
I mean, having educational systems that work well,

550
00:23:36.257 --> 00:23:38.486
having children who exercise, having people

551
00:23:38.486 --> 00:23:39.766
who have good diets.

552
00:23:39.766 --> 00:23:41.643
These are much more important than

553
00:23:41.643 --> 00:23:43.062
people sitting around with a lot

554
00:23:43.062 --> 00:23:44.736
of free time and doing meditation.

555
00:23:44.736 --> 00:23:45.707
<v Interviewer>But doesn't it take a little plasticity</v>

556
00:23:45.707 --> 00:23:47.189
in the brain just to understand that these

557
00:23:47.189 --> 00:23:50.720
should be our focal points and our priorities in life?

558
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.280
Shifting away from the traditional materialistic view

559
00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.736
that we know about and maybe billions of people now

560
00:23:56.736 --> 00:24:00.202
have started, have developed, or been hanging onto?

561
00:24:00.202 --> 00:24:01.567
<v ->You may well be right.</v>

562
00:24:01.567 --> 00:24:06.567
If the point is, if we pay attention to,

563
00:24:07.146 --> 00:24:10.484
I guess I would worry, I think you're right,

564
00:24:10.484 --> 00:24:12.479
but my concern would be something like this:

565
00:24:12.479 --> 00:24:16.660
that we always look for quick fixes,

566
00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.729
so if people think you don't have to change

567
00:24:18.729 --> 00:24:22.932
the economy, but that people of all different

568
00:24:22.932 --> 00:24:25.534
socioeconomic groups can sit around and do meditation

569
00:24:25.534 --> 00:24:28.414
and that will make them nicer, kinder, better people,

570
00:24:28.414 --> 00:24:31.656
or you don't have to change the schools, then I worry.

571
00:24:31.656 --> 00:24:33.918
It's a little bit like, and then we can give pills

572
00:24:33.918 --> 00:24:35.795
for the ones who don't want to work on that,

573
00:24:35.795 --> 00:24:37.194
so we're not changing the structures of everyday life.

574
00:24:37.194 --> 00:24:38.538
<v Interviewer>But that's reprioritizing</v>

575
00:24:38.538 --> 00:24:40.543
to understand those things need revamping.

576
00:24:40.543 --> 00:24:41.471
<v ->Revamping, I think that's right--</v>

577
00:24:41.471 --> 00:24:46.471
<v Interviewer>It's a practical application, but there are</v>

578
00:24:46.761 --> 00:24:50.132
implications on the other side

579
00:24:50.132 --> 00:24:53.427
that actually lead to this state we call happiness

580
00:24:53.427 --> 00:24:55.859
or maybe just leading to what we call

581
00:24:55.859 --> 00:24:58.536
a meaningful life, by coming to grips with some of these.

582
00:24:58.536 --> 00:25:01.128
<v ->Right. Well, as I said at the beginning of my talk</v>

583
00:25:01.128 --> 00:25:03.805
this morning, the key thing, to me, is not whether

584
00:25:03.805 --> 00:25:05.960
people actually feel happy subjectively,

585
00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.795
although that's nice. I mean, the best of

586
00:25:07.795 --> 00:25:09.117
all possible worlds, people would feel happy

587
00:25:09.117 --> 00:25:10.696
about their lives, but whether or not

588
00:25:10.696 --> 00:25:12.328
people feel as if they have a sense of

589
00:25:12.328 --> 00:25:14.504
purposefulness, meaningfulness, whether

590
00:25:14.504 --> 00:25:17.874
they've made a difference to the world,

591
00:25:17.874 --> 00:25:22.076
that they have a little bit of involvement.

592
00:25:22.076 --> 00:25:24.583
<v Interviewer>I agree. Thank you so much for your time.</v>

593
00:25:24.583 --> 00:25:26.716
<v ->Thank you very much.</v>

594
00:25:26.716 --> 00:25:28.924
<v ->Dr. Flanagan has authored a number of books,</v>

595
00:25:28.924 --> 00:25:30.737
which you can find by going to Amazon

596
00:25:30.737 --> 00:25:32.135
or other major booksellers.

597
00:25:32.135 --> 00:25:33.895
Meanwhile, if you like Owen's perspective

598
00:25:33.895 --> 00:25:35.889
on happiness, you might also enjoy our

599
00:25:35.889 --> 00:25:38.396
interviews with Peter Russell and Russell Targ.

600
00:25:38.396 --> 00:25:40.795
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
