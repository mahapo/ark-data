00:00:00.677 --> 00:00:03.462
<v ->Feeding my body has been a lifelong education.</v>

2
00:00:03.462 --> 00:00:06.603
Beginning with high protein diets in the 1970's,

3
00:00:06.603 --> 00:00:08.641
followed by 20 years of vegetarianism,

4
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.464
and then a balance between the two.

5
00:00:10.464 --> 00:00:13.130
And now my body's crying out for more greens.

6
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.365
Indeed, greens have become big business.

7
00:00:15.365 --> 00:00:17.647
But it hasn't been until now that I've been motivated

8
00:00:17.647 --> 00:00:19.395
to do an interview on them.

9
00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:22.275
Billy Merritt exemplifies the shining health of someone

10
00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:25.508
who is dedicated to consuming greens and super foods.

11
00:00:25.508 --> 00:00:27.727
Today he formulates and sells his own,

12
00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:29.860
which I sampled at the Green Living Expo

13
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.537
and was euphoric over, literally.

14
00:00:32.537 --> 00:00:34.669
We visited him to find out more about the subject

15
00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:36.278
in Topanga Canyon.

16
00:00:36.278 --> 00:00:40.752 line:15% 
(light soothing music)

17
00:00:48.864 --> 00:00:52.310
Billy, alchemy comes to mind when I think about the affect

18
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.734
that your greens that you have produced have on me.

19
00:00:55.734 --> 00:00:58.198
And I've done commentary on this before.

20
00:00:58.198 --> 00:01:01.579
It's really kind of arising in consciousness,

21
00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.821
the notion that our bodies are craving greens.

22
00:01:04.821 --> 00:01:07.178
And before we get into what you've done to these

23
00:01:07.178 --> 00:01:08.689
to make them so magical,

24
00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.890
let's talk a little bit about your own journey into greens

25
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.789
and health and awareness and consciousness.

26
00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:15.346
And I know everybody looking at you thinks,

27
00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:18.194
"He's 22 years old, what could he possibly know?"

28
00:01:18.194 --> 00:01:20.615
And it's like some other people I've interviewed,

29
00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:22.418
who also live this life style,

30
00:01:22.418 --> 00:01:25.063
you're just incredibly healthy and youthful.

31
00:01:25.063 --> 00:01:27.669
So let's talk about your journey a bit into the awareness

32
00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:30.677
of health and nutrition and spirit.

33
00:01:30.677 --> 00:01:31.690
<v ->Great.</v>

34
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.586
Ready when you are.

35
00:01:32.586 --> 00:01:33.514
<v Woman>Go for it.</v>

36
00:01:33.514 --> 00:01:34.301
<v ->Okay. (laughs)</v>

37
00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:37.448
<v Woman>So, where did this part of the journey begin?</v>

38
00:01:37.448 --> 00:01:39.805
I know we can't go all the way back to birth, but

39
00:01:39.805 --> 00:01:42.513
(Billy laughs) when did you become aware

40
00:01:42.513 --> 00:01:45.575
that your body was really craving certain nutrients,

41
00:01:45.575 --> 00:01:48.092
and that these were having a profound effect on you

42
00:01:48.092 --> 00:01:49.884
and that this was going to be your dharma?

43
00:01:49.884 --> 00:01:52.283
<v ->Oh, good question, okay, I can start there.</v>

44
00:01:52.283 --> 00:01:52.998
<v Woman>Yeah.</v>

45
00:01:52.998 --> 00:01:55.920
<v ->Because there are actually many ways I could answer this,</v>

46
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.477
and I think I'll just answer it in...

47
00:02:00.634 --> 00:02:03.023
Well, it's gonna have some emotion, I'll tell you that.

48
00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:04.101
<v Woman>That's okay.</v>

49
00:02:04.101 --> 00:02:08.412
<v ->That when health just totally fails,</v>

50
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.320
it kicks us into a survival mode where it's like,

51
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.673
okay, it's either death

52
00:02:16.673 --> 00:02:20.492
or we just learn to heal and figure this out.

53
00:02:20.492 --> 00:02:24.069
And it was a number of years ago

54
00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.324
that I was diagnosed as having brain tumors.

55
00:02:28.324 --> 00:02:32.055
And was having seizures.

56
00:02:32.055 --> 00:02:33.517
Every day.

57
00:02:33.517 --> 00:02:37.602
And it progressively got worse and worse

58
00:02:37.602 --> 00:02:40.162
to where I was having multiple seizures a day.

59
00:02:40.162 --> 00:02:43.285
And thank the lord, knock on wood,

60
00:02:43.846 --> 00:02:45.371
that they were mild seizures,

61
00:02:45.371 --> 00:02:49.776
where I would just draw a blank for about 30 seconds.

62
00:02:49.776 --> 00:02:51.093
But that...

63
00:02:52.197 --> 00:02:55.723
What happened during that time is

64
00:02:55.723 --> 00:02:59.685
I just hit the pause button on all other

65
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:06.217
ventures in life and focused 110% on healing.

66
00:03:06.815 --> 00:03:07.983
And

67
00:03:08.767 --> 00:03:11.178
it started with a lot more prayer, saying,

68
00:03:11.178 --> 00:03:15.071
"Okay, God, what next, what do we do?

69
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:16.116
"Anybody out there?

70
00:03:16.116 --> 00:03:17.374
Hello?"

71
00:03:17.374 --> 00:03:20.360
And that some real inspiration

72
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.792
and guidance came to me.

73
00:03:22.792 --> 00:03:26.738
First of all, I was praying to heal, you know.

74
00:03:26.738 --> 00:03:29.906
Okay, God, heal this suffering, this agony.

75
00:03:29.906 --> 00:03:32.263
Heal these seizures, these tumors.

76
00:03:32.263 --> 00:03:35.688
And the healing didn't come just like

77
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.924
turning on a switch.

78
00:03:37.924 --> 00:03:39.673
I mean, really, some could argue,

79
00:03:39.673 --> 00:03:42.254
the healing has never really come.

80
00:03:42.254 --> 00:03:45.245
What I've really come to understand in all of this is that

81
00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:50.119
healing is a constant balance and re-balancing.

82
00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:54.597
That what I've really come to realize is also that

83
00:03:54.597 --> 00:03:58.886
we are just blessed with the most incredible resources.

84
00:03:58.886 --> 00:03:59.878
(reporter vocalizes agreement)

85
00:03:59.878 --> 00:04:02.022
That the holy spirit is like, "What do you need?

86
00:04:02.022 --> 00:04:05.819
I got some treasure here for you."

87
00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.260
And that I developed a fascination,

88
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.916
this real curiosity,

89
00:04:12.916 --> 00:04:16.072
with the nutritional elements, because again,

90
00:04:16.072 --> 00:04:19.741
when I, years ago, started making my own food,

91
00:04:19.741 --> 00:04:22.429
even though it was just peanut butter and jelly and pasta,

92
00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:23.804
it was better.

93
00:04:23.804 --> 00:04:25.435
And again, some enlightenment happened there.

94
00:04:25.435 --> 00:04:30.310
And it actually, the changes snowballed over years.

95
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.302
To where I began to eat healthier and healthier,

96
00:04:33.302 --> 00:04:35.841
and would feel more of a difference.

97
00:04:35.841 --> 00:04:38.166
And before long I was eating,

98
00:04:38.166 --> 00:04:40.053
the majority of my diet was just

99
00:04:40.053 --> 00:04:42.911
raw fruits and vegetables, super foods that just gave me

100
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:46.186
such an energy, a vigor, a vitality.

101
00:04:46.186 --> 00:04:50.292
That I realized, okay, this is something that needs to

102
00:04:50.292 --> 00:04:52.467
be a real priority in our lives.

103
00:04:52.467 --> 00:04:55.572
That we can have this just invaluable life force.

104
00:04:55.572 --> 00:04:58.068
That just, we feel so good.

105
00:04:58.068 --> 00:04:59.112
And so...

106
00:05:00.285 --> 00:05:04.096
Going back to the past again,

107
00:05:04.677 --> 00:05:09.212
I realized that, okay,

108
00:05:10.263 --> 00:05:14.483
I'm on this healing journey and...

109
00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:16.584
<v Woman>What were some of the insights</v>

110
00:05:16.584 --> 00:05:18.781
that you were being given through this

111
00:05:18.781 --> 00:05:21.459
that you put into practice for yourself?

112
00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:23.997
The whole notion of brain tumors and seizures

113
00:05:23.997 --> 00:05:25.948
and everything I find fascinating anyway.

114
00:05:25.948 --> 00:05:29.361
There are a lot of other things going on often times

115
00:05:29.361 --> 00:05:31.858
when a person experiences this.

116
00:05:31.858 --> 00:05:32.775
<v ->Yes.</v>

117
00:05:32.775 --> 00:05:35.015
<v Woman>Yeah, rewiring of all kinds, and--</v>

118
00:05:35.015 --> 00:05:38.590
<v ->Right, it was a whole rewiring of life.</v>

119
00:05:39.513 --> 00:05:41.823
Lifestyle, thought.

120
00:05:42.137 --> 00:05:44.834
Just habits, everything.

121
00:05:44.834 --> 00:05:49.303
Where I, first of all, I would just pray.

122
00:05:49.303 --> 00:05:51.265
Hours, every day.

123
00:05:51.806 --> 00:05:55.852
And that it started with just a little prayer and I noticed.

124
00:05:55.852 --> 00:05:57.302
hey, I was a happier person.

125
00:05:57.302 --> 00:06:00.855
That my prayer wasn't being answering

126
00:06:00.855 --> 00:06:04.556
in the way I was expecting, but it was being answered.

127
00:06:04.556 --> 00:06:09.493
And when I say pray, I would let God know my desires.

128
00:06:10.201 --> 00:06:12.551
And then I would listen.

129
00:06:13.315 --> 00:06:16.117
And I realized more and more, just in that time,

130
00:06:16.117 --> 00:06:18.560
just how much value there is in listening.

131
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.163
That that's really a part that we leave out often.

132
00:06:21.163 --> 00:06:24.064
That we need to let the universe know our desires,

133
00:06:24.064 --> 00:06:25.099
what we want.

134
00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:28.074
It's important to let the spirit know what we want in life,

135
00:06:28.074 --> 00:06:32.373
but we also have to express our faith and expectancy

136
00:06:32.373 --> 00:06:34.191
by just listening.

137
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:35.248
Or meditating.
<v Woman>And often times,</v>

138
00:06:35.248 --> 00:06:37.359
people think you have to go for another CAT scan

139
00:06:37.359 --> 00:06:39.109
to hear the answer.
<v Billy>Right.</v>

140
00:06:39.109 --> 00:06:40.857
<v Woman>Instead of really listening.</v>

141
00:06:40.857 --> 00:06:42.095
<v ->Yeah.</v>

142
00:06:42.095 --> 00:06:45.134
And that what was interesting is

143
00:06:45.134 --> 00:06:49.028
I would hear little bits and pieces of guidance

144
00:06:49.028 --> 00:06:50.361
throughout the rest of the day.

145
00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:52.175
When I would listen, I wouldn't necessarily hear anything,

146
00:06:52.175 --> 00:06:54.510
I wouldn't hear angel voices.

147
00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.169
Sometimes I did, but few and far between.

148
00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:00.825
But I would, later in the day,

149
00:07:00.825 --> 00:07:04.315
often times just get a really strong hunch

150
00:07:04.673 --> 00:07:08.832
An unusually powerful inspiration, intuition.

151
00:07:08.832 --> 00:07:11.663
Like this angel feeling.

152
00:07:12.426 --> 00:07:13.723
And it's hard to describe,

153
00:07:13.723 --> 00:07:17.971
but it has just so much meaning in my life right now.

154
00:07:18.276 --> 00:07:21.475
That it's gotten me from where I was there to here.

155
00:07:21.475 --> 00:07:26.371
To really just being able to turn this agony and suffering

156
00:07:26.371 --> 00:07:30.833
into an incredible channel of healing

157
00:07:30.833 --> 00:07:33.723
for myself and many people.

158
00:07:33.723 --> 00:07:35.270
<v Woman>Well, I think that's why they're drawn to you.</v>

159
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.327
You opened up, it's almost as though you really

160
00:07:37.327 --> 00:07:41.576
integrated your true self in with your physical reality.

161
00:07:41.956 --> 00:07:42.830
And beyond.

162
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.206
<v ->Exactly.</v>

163
00:07:44.206 --> 00:07:47.257
Well said, that I just was better able to

164
00:07:47.257 --> 00:07:50.229
identify with my spiritual identity.

165
00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:53.394
And that when you start there,

166
00:07:54.061 --> 00:07:58.690
again, you just become a better listener to those voices.

167
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.295
Those hunches, those instincts

168
00:08:02.295 --> 00:08:04.959
that push you and pull you in the right direction.

169
00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:07.658
Where I'll just get that hunch, go right.

170
00:08:07.658 --> 00:08:09.026
Go left.

171
00:08:09.543 --> 00:08:10.889
Do this.

172
00:08:11.365 --> 00:08:13.498
Here's where the story actually gets really interesting.

173
00:08:13.498 --> 00:08:16.248
I wasn't gonna tell you this part, but okay, why not.

174
00:08:16.248 --> 00:08:17.806
<v Woman>Please do.</v>

175
00:08:17.806 --> 00:08:19.762
<v ->It's entertaining anyway.</v>

176
00:08:19.762 --> 00:08:24.471
And that I tried with a number of herbs

177
00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:27.439
and healing practices and super foods

178
00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:30.202
to heal naturally.

179
00:08:30.202 --> 00:08:32.185
And to be honest, I even tried the drugs.

180
00:08:32.185 --> 00:08:34.563
I tried anti-seizure drugs.

181
00:08:34.563 --> 00:08:37.251
I looked into brain surgery.

182
00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:40.723
And nothing was working, nothing.

183
00:08:41.122 --> 00:08:44.472
Health got a little better, a little more stable.

184
00:08:44.472 --> 00:08:47.472
And in retrospect, I think it was actually

185
00:08:47.472 --> 00:08:50.977
just that quiet time in the morning every day,

186
00:08:50.977 --> 00:08:53.853
where I would just really sit and be very still.

187
00:08:53.853 --> 00:08:55.400
It's actually known that when you do that,

188
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.097
when you meditate or are just sitting quietly,

189
00:08:58.097 --> 00:09:00.294
that your neurological system

190
00:09:00.294 --> 00:09:02.395
does go through a metabolic change.

191
00:09:02.395 --> 00:09:03.545
<v Woman>It does, and it goes into</v>

192
00:09:03.545 --> 00:09:04.504
more of a balanced state.

193
00:09:04.504 --> 00:09:05.143
<v ->Yes.</v>

194
00:09:05.143 --> 00:09:07.981
Yeah, your brain chemistry actually has been tested

195
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:10.135
to shift dramatically.

196
00:09:10.135 --> 00:09:13.164
Where it's incredibly balancing and enriching

197
00:09:13.164 --> 00:09:15.814
and therapeutic and restful for the body.

198
00:09:16.439 --> 00:09:18.796
So I highly recommend that every day.

199
00:09:18.796 --> 00:09:19.564
(laughs)

200
00:09:19.564 --> 00:09:21.334
<v Woman>I can tell, and I agree with you.</v>

201
00:09:21.334 --> 00:09:22.656
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

202
00:09:22.656 --> 00:09:24.031
I mean, if I don't meditate,

203
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:25.663
I'll probably still will get through the day,

204
00:09:25.663 --> 00:09:28.691
but there will generally be a little more agony.

205
00:09:28.691 --> 00:09:29.448
(laughs)

206
00:09:29.448 --> 00:09:31.271
<v Woman>Maybe a little more drama.</v>

207
00:09:31.271 --> 00:09:32.732
So, what happened then?

208
00:09:32.732 --> 00:09:35.068
<v ->The story, okay, right, okay.</v>

209
00:09:35.068 --> 00:09:35.948
So...

210
00:09:37.553 --> 00:09:41.061
I had, again, been living a really healing lifestyle

211
00:09:41.061 --> 00:09:45.603
and made some improvements, but still was unfit to work.

212
00:09:45.603 --> 00:09:46.728
You know, I was--

213
00:09:46.728 --> 00:09:47.909
<v Woman>Were you still having seizures?</v>

214
00:09:47.909 --> 00:09:49.209
<v ->Having a tough time, having seizures.</v>

215
00:09:49.209 --> 00:09:50.936
Fewer, but still having them.

216
00:09:51.984 --> 00:09:54.501
And I was having a quiet night at home.

217
00:09:54.501 --> 00:09:58.852
And I actually just heard this very still, small voice.

218
00:09:58.852 --> 00:10:00.132
This was one of those few times

219
00:10:00.132 --> 00:10:01.614
where I've actually heard voices.

220
00:10:01.614 --> 00:10:04.153
Probably only two times in my life.

221
00:10:04.153 --> 00:10:05.881
But this was one of them.

222
00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:07.673
And the voice said this:

223
00:10:07.673 --> 00:10:10.423
"Just drop everything you're doing in life

224
00:10:10.423 --> 00:10:12.697
and go to Napal."

225
00:10:12.697 --> 00:10:13.870
I swear to God.

226
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:14.830
<v Woman>I believe it.</v>

227
00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:15.548
<v Billy>Okay.</v>
<v Woman>Yeah.</v>

228
00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:16.582
<v Billy>And I did.</v>

229
00:10:16.582 --> 00:10:17.771
I said

230
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.824
okay.

231
00:10:19.824 --> 00:10:20.570
<v Woman>I've done this,</v>

232
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:21.723
so I totally get it.
<v Billy>Oh, okay.</v>

233
00:10:21.723 --> 00:10:22.479
(both laugh)

234
00:10:22.479 --> 00:10:23.683
So, I did.

235
00:10:23.683 --> 00:10:28.482
I just took care of all my bank accounts

236
00:10:28.482 --> 00:10:30.445
and got everything kind of situated.

237
00:10:30.445 --> 00:10:34.857
And I subletted my house and I bought a plane ticket.

238
00:10:35.128 --> 00:10:36.125
One way.

239
00:10:36.602 --> 00:10:38.960
And flew six days later.

240
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.610
And going there not sure just what this was for.

241
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.785
Was I going to die in the mountains?

242
00:10:45.785 --> 00:10:50.298
Was I going to meet a yogi that would heal me upon touch?

243
00:10:50.298 --> 00:10:52.152
What would happen?

244
00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:53.711
And I expected to heal.

245
00:10:53.711 --> 00:10:56.046
I asked, I asked the spirit, okay, what are we going for?

246
00:10:56.046 --> 00:10:57.732
He said, "You're gonna heal."

247
00:10:57.732 --> 00:10:59.407
I said alright.

248
00:10:59.407 --> 00:11:03.768
So, I was in Kathmandu.

249
00:11:03.768 --> 00:11:07.800
I decided to go on a trek.

250
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.944
And it was actually a pretty light trek,

251
00:11:09.944 --> 00:11:12.483
where you're just hiking from village to village.

252
00:11:12.483 --> 00:11:14.274
In this region called the Himachal Pradesh,

253
00:11:14.274 --> 00:11:18.658
I did this 300 mile loop over the period of 38 days.

254
00:11:18.658 --> 00:11:21.079
Just hiking seven, eight miles a day

255
00:11:21.079 --> 00:11:23.863
and then staying in guest houses.

256
00:11:23.863 --> 00:11:26.177
And it was magical.

257
00:11:26.177 --> 00:11:28.409
I just saw the best views in my life.

258
00:11:28.409 --> 00:11:30.414
Met amazing travelers along the way.

259
00:11:30.414 --> 00:11:33.491
Great culture, great local people.

260
00:11:34.413 --> 00:11:37.752
Had some revelations, had come insights, but didn't heal.

261
00:11:37.752 --> 00:11:41.651
It's time to come home, and I was actually flying home

262
00:11:42.336 --> 00:11:45.974
through Bangkok, this is a few years ago,

263
00:11:45.974 --> 00:11:48.373
and I don't know if you remember in the news

264
00:11:48.373 --> 00:11:51.243
when there were all the protests in Bangkok,

265
00:11:51.243 --> 00:11:52.054
in the airport.

266
00:11:52.054 --> 00:11:52.820
And it actually
<v Woman>I do,</v>

267
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:53.965
<v Billy>closed the airport.</v>
<v Woman>we were, I think,</v>

268
00:11:53.965 --> 00:11:55.120
in Thailand
<v Billy>Are you serious?</v>

269
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.734
<v Woman>right about that time, yes, we were.</v>

270
00:11:56.734 --> 00:11:59.696
We were (Billy laughs) north of there though, yeah.

271
00:11:59.696 --> 00:12:03.945
<v ->Okay, so I was stuck, and for two weeks.</v>

272
00:12:04.227 --> 00:12:06.222
And so what do you do when you're stuck?

273
00:12:06.222 --> 00:12:09.187
I took a train to Loas,

274
00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:11.769
Luang Prabang, a village, a fishing village,

275
00:12:11.769 --> 00:12:14.029
to spend those two weeks.

276
00:12:14.029 --> 00:12:17.015
And I was the most bored and lonely I've been

277
00:12:17.015 --> 00:12:18.392
in my entire life.

278
00:12:18.392 --> 00:12:20.078
Totally depressed.

279
00:12:20.078 --> 00:12:23.011
I wasn't able to come home for Thanksgiving.

280
00:12:23.011 --> 00:12:23.884
And--

281
00:12:23.884 --> 00:12:24.781
<v Woman>So you didn't feel like you were</v>

282
00:12:24.781 --> 00:12:26.136
on your healing journey anymore?

283
00:12:26.136 --> 00:12:26.784
<v ->No.</v>

284
00:12:27.257 --> 00:12:31.290
And It was actually there,

285
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:32.708
in Luang Prabang,

286
00:12:32.708 --> 00:12:35.748
that my seizures stopped, like that.

287
00:12:35.748 --> 00:12:36.878
<v Woman>Interesting.</v>

288
00:12:36.878 --> 00:12:38.489
And was there anything that--

289
00:12:38.489 --> 00:12:40.111
<v Billy>Yes.</v>
<v Woman>Okay.</v>

290
00:12:40.111 --> 00:12:42.899
This is getting juicy, I wanna hear this.

291
00:12:42.899 --> 00:12:44.707
<v ->And the local food.</v>

292
00:12:44.707 --> 00:12:48.971
It was that the majority of the diet

293
00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:51.084
is pickled pork. (laughs)

294
00:12:51.084 --> 00:12:52.694
<v Woman>Pickled pork, okay.</v>

295
00:12:52.694 --> 00:12:54.358
<v Billy>Pickled fish.</v>
<v Woman>Pickled fish.</v>

296
00:12:54.358 --> 00:12:55.906
<v Billy>And I couldn't bring myself to eat it.</v>

297
00:12:55.906 --> 00:12:56.718
<v Woman>Yeah.</v>

298
00:12:56.718 --> 00:12:58.297
<v Billy>And so for those two weeks,</v>

299
00:12:58.297 --> 00:13:00.982
I ate nothing but wild coconuts.

300
00:13:00.982 --> 00:13:03.040
That I picked.
(woman vocalizes fascination)

301
00:13:03.407 --> 00:13:04.373
<v Woman>Interesting.</v>

302
00:13:04.373 --> 00:13:07.017
<v ->And the seizures stopped, like that.</v>

303
00:13:07.017 --> 00:13:07.731
<v Woman>Wow.</v>

304
00:13:07.731 --> 00:13:08.605
<v ->So it was pretty neat.</v>

305
00:13:08.605 --> 00:13:10.450
And I knew, instinctively, that it was because

306
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.737
I was just eating nothing but coconuts.

307
00:13:13.737 --> 00:13:15.112
And I came back and actually,

308
00:13:15.112 --> 00:13:19.037
when I came back to the United States a couple weeks later,

309
00:13:19.037 --> 00:13:22.045
I researched it, and there's actually

310
00:13:22.045 --> 00:13:26.811
a very little known therapy called the ketogenic diet.

311
00:13:26.811 --> 00:13:29.179
It's a high fat diet where you are basically

312
00:13:29.179 --> 00:13:31.535
surviving on nothing but fat.

313
00:13:31.535 --> 00:13:34.702
And your body goes into a state of what's called ketosis.

314
00:13:34.702 --> 00:13:37.477
And nobody knows why, but it has

315
00:13:37.857 --> 00:13:40.277
as powerful, if not more powerful

316
00:13:40.277 --> 00:13:42.814
of an anti-seizure property than any drug.

317
00:13:42.814 --> 00:13:43.507
So--

318
00:13:43.507 --> 00:13:44.137
<v Woman>Amazing.</v>

319
00:13:44.137 --> 00:13:45.321
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

320
00:13:45.321 --> 00:13:46.846
And people should know about that.

321
00:13:46.846 --> 00:13:48.488
<v Woman>Yes, they should.</v>
<v Billy>Because there are--</v>

322
00:13:48.488 --> 00:13:49.545
<v Woman>Brain tumors are on the rise.</v>

323
00:13:49.545 --> 00:13:50.718
People need to know about this.

324
00:13:50.718 --> 00:13:51.518
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

325
00:13:51.518 --> 00:13:54.152
And seizures are to.
<v Woman>Yeah, exactly.</v>

326
00:13:54.152 --> 00:13:55.411
<v Billy>Especially in children.</v>

327
00:13:55.411 --> 00:13:56.870
<v Woman>Yeah.</v>

328
00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:00.710
Wow, so you were living on a pure coconut diet.

329
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.003
Now, were you eating the young coconuts

330
00:14:03.003 --> 00:14:04.348
or the the mature coconuts?

331
00:14:04.348 --> 00:14:05.233
Drinking the juice?

332
00:14:05.233 --> 00:14:07.024
eating the mature flesh, the young flesh?

333
00:14:07.024 --> 00:14:07.942
<v ->Eating the meat.</v>

334
00:14:07.942 --> 00:14:10.118
<v Woman>Both, young and mature coconuts?</v>

335
00:14:10.118 --> 00:14:10.774
<v ->Yeah.</v>

336
00:14:10.774 --> 00:14:13.035
<v Woman>Okay, so the seizures stopped.</v>

337
00:14:13.035 --> 00:14:14.497
And you must have, I mean,

338
00:14:14.497 --> 00:14:16.951
talk about an epiphany.

339
00:14:16.951 --> 00:14:17.995
<v ->Yes.</v>

340
00:14:17.995 --> 00:14:18.556
Yeah.

341
00:14:18.556 --> 00:14:20.486
<v Woman>And so, now you fly home.</v>

342
00:14:20.486 --> 00:14:21.702
What happens after this?

343
00:14:21.702 --> 00:14:22.843
You're studying about it?

344
00:14:22.843 --> 00:14:23.891
<v ->Well, it was another level of passion</v>

345
00:14:23.891 --> 00:14:26.256
that I brought to life here.

346
00:14:26.256 --> 00:14:30.345
Just that, hey, okay, this is how the spirit works.

347
00:14:30.345 --> 00:14:33.189
And that I just continue to receive

348
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:34.995
that kind of guidance and inspiration.

349
00:14:34.995 --> 00:14:37.701
To make changes in my business.

350
00:14:37.701 --> 00:14:41.684
Or to do a retreat here in Topanga.

351
00:14:43.087 --> 00:14:43.876
It's interesting.

352
00:14:43.876 --> 00:14:46.813
We're all so in a steep part of learning curve

353
00:14:46.813 --> 00:14:48.113
in life right now.

354
00:14:48.113 --> 00:14:49.928
I haven't figured out all the answers.

355
00:14:49.928 --> 00:14:52.753
And what I've come to realize is that healing is,

356
00:14:52.753 --> 00:14:55.484
again, it's a constant balancing

357
00:14:55.484 --> 00:14:58.174
and rebalancing that,

358
00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.849
according to medical science, I still have tumors.

359
00:15:01.849 --> 00:15:03.289
They can still be an interference.

360
00:15:03.289 --> 00:15:06.797
And that according to some doctors, I'm lucky to be alive.

361
00:15:06.797 --> 00:15:09.123
But I know that's not, it's not luck.

362
00:15:09.123 --> 00:15:11.235
You know, I get those angel messages

363
00:15:11.235 --> 00:15:13.613
that when we have a passion

364
00:15:13.613 --> 00:15:17.325
to make life better here on planet Earth

365
00:15:17.325 --> 00:15:19.544
for ourselves and for those around us,

366
00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:21.922
that the spirit's like, okay,

367
00:15:21.922 --> 00:15:26.050
well, that's when we know how to make matter move

368
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.493
and part and do its own thing.

369
00:15:28.493 --> 00:15:29.639
And that

370
00:15:30.178 --> 00:15:32.962
those kinds of facts and information

371
00:15:32.962 --> 00:15:36.044
just don't have the same reality.

372
00:15:36.044 --> 00:15:36.919
<v Woman>They do not.</v>

373
00:15:36.919 --> 00:15:38.689
I couldn't agree with you more

374
00:15:38.689 --> 00:15:41.836
that this is the Holy Grail, as it were,

375
00:15:41.836 --> 00:15:43.628
when people are looking for health.

376
00:15:43.628 --> 00:15:45.856
you can run to a doctor or a guru

377
00:15:45.856 --> 00:15:48.097
or you can run to a super food.

378
00:15:48.097 --> 00:15:50.678
Nothing trumps the power

379
00:15:50.678 --> 00:15:53.747
of having that direct connection with spirit.

380
00:15:53.747 --> 00:15:56.296
That trumps everything, it can change everything.

381
00:15:56.296 --> 00:15:58.515
In the face of, like you say, having,

382
00:15:58.515 --> 00:16:01.351
supposed, still physical tumors sitting there

383
00:16:01.351 --> 00:16:03.410
has nothing to do with your profile of health.

384
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:04.123
<v ->Yes.</v>

385
00:16:04.123 --> 00:16:06.929
I don't feel lucky to be sitting here, I feel blessed.

386
00:16:06.929 --> 00:16:09.553
<v Woman>Yeah, it's a part of the plan.</v>

387
00:16:09.553 --> 00:16:10.950
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

388
00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:12.635
<v Woman>Okay, now, you took that.</v>

389
00:16:12.635 --> 00:16:16.827
And we're in Topanga, in this beautiful, beautiful spot.

390
00:16:16.827 --> 00:16:20.155
And a few miles from here as the crow flies,

391
00:16:20.155 --> 00:16:23.141
you worked for quite a long time at an ashram.

392
00:16:23.141 --> 00:16:26.393
Now, what happened between the time your seizures stopped,

393
00:16:26.393 --> 00:16:28.855
you started really intensively studying nutrition,

394
00:16:28.855 --> 00:16:31.991
you started working at the ashram, and formulating.

395
00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:33.410
Let's talk about that part of the journey.

396
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:34.392
<v ->Okay.</v>

397
00:16:34.731 --> 00:16:36.266
Well, they're still over there,

398
00:16:36.266 --> 00:16:39.371
and I definitely visit frequently.

399
00:16:39.371 --> 00:16:41.888
I don't work full time at the ashram anymore.

400
00:16:41.888 --> 00:16:45.495
I'm so busy here at the Infinity Health Retreat,

401
00:16:45.495 --> 00:16:48.367
putting together programs, and also just

402
00:16:48.367 --> 00:16:52.410
making sure the greens business is running A plus.

403
00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:55.780
And so, I still visit. (laughs)

404
00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.211
I'm sorry, what was your question?

405
00:16:57.211 --> 00:16:59.843
<v Woman>What did you learn during all of the time</v>

406
00:16:59.843 --> 00:17:02.183
that you were spending doing these formulations

407
00:17:02.183 --> 00:17:03.931
and tinkering and playing
<v Billy>Oh, okay.</v>

408
00:17:03.931 --> 00:17:05.681
<v Woman>with the foods for the clients though</v>

409
00:17:05.681 --> 00:17:07.675
that were on their healing journeys?

410
00:17:07.675 --> 00:17:10.353
And also, give us some anecdotal information

411
00:17:10.353 --> 00:17:12.913
of some of what you witnessed?

412
00:17:12.913 --> 00:17:13.970
<v ->Right.</v>

413
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:18.253
It was such an awesome experience for just learning

414
00:17:18.253 --> 00:17:21.251
and watching how nutrition can just

415
00:17:21.251 --> 00:17:23.225
so dramatically impact our--

416
00:17:23.225 --> 00:17:24.386
<v Woman>So, so what were your bases?</v>

417
00:17:24.386 --> 00:17:25.485
What were you playing with over there

418
00:17:25.485 --> 00:17:27.534
as your basis for the Healing Diet?

419
00:17:27.534 --> 00:17:28.973
I assume you were do everything.

420
00:17:28.973 --> 00:17:30.725
Cancers, everything, right?

421
00:17:30.725 --> 00:17:32.560
<v ->Well, here's the thing.</v>

422
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.377
The ashram is a program where people really come

423
00:17:35.377 --> 00:17:37.695
to just ramp up their fitness.

424
00:17:38.617 --> 00:17:41.486
That it's therapeutic and people come

425
00:17:41.486 --> 00:17:45.956
with various ailments that they're trying to heal.

426
00:17:45.956 --> 00:17:48.280
But it's more fitness.

427
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.372
There's definitely a powerful element of detox.

428
00:17:50.372 --> 00:17:52.792
But people are really trying to

429
00:17:52.792 --> 00:17:56.345
just improve every organ action and function.

430
00:17:56.345 --> 00:18:00.430
They're just trying to come and really get fit.

431
00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:01.550
<v Woman>Up their vitality.</v>

432
00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:02.541
<v Billy>Yeah.</v>
<v Woman>Yeah.</v>

433
00:18:02.541 --> 00:18:05.389
<v Billy>And so, it's a week long program</v>

434
00:18:05.389 --> 00:18:09.347
where people are, every day, just working out

435
00:18:09.347 --> 00:18:12.236
from morning to evening with trainers.

436
00:18:12.236 --> 00:18:16.556
And what I had the opportunity to do was

437
00:18:16.556 --> 00:18:18.975
work there as a resident trainer,

438
00:18:18.975 --> 00:18:21.226
where the majority of what I was doing was

439
00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:24.586
mixing and matching different blends of super foods

440
00:18:24.586 --> 00:18:25.962
and healing herbs.

441
00:18:25.962 --> 00:18:29.375
And then would be serving them to the guests every day.

442
00:18:29.375 --> 00:18:33.502
And each week, I would actually just fine tune

443
00:18:33.502 --> 00:18:35.390
the formulation that I would be giving them.

444
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:38.718
I would add more of a particular herb or take something out.

445
00:18:38.718 --> 00:18:39.657
And so, it was interesting.

446
00:18:39.657 --> 00:18:43.944
I actually could see week to week some variation

447
00:18:43.944 --> 00:18:47.944
in how much these healing super foods would impact people,

448
00:18:47.944 --> 00:18:51.741
and take their energy and vitality and vigor

449
00:18:51.741 --> 00:18:52.967
to another level.

450
00:18:52.967 --> 00:18:55.751
And weeks that it wouldn't make a difference at all.

451
00:18:55.751 --> 00:18:58.576
And it was able to really just sort of

452
00:18:58.576 --> 00:19:01.724
fine tune these blends.

453
00:19:01.724 --> 00:19:03.761
To optimize the benefits.

454
00:19:03.761 --> 00:19:06.682
And could just see it in the people

455
00:19:06.682 --> 00:19:09.328
as they'd be out on trail hiking,

456
00:19:09.328 --> 00:19:10.374
how they would feel.

457
00:19:10.374 --> 00:19:12.442
If people would be detoxing.

458
00:19:12.442 --> 00:19:14.779
Many people would come and just kind of feel nauseous

459
00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:17.508
Tuesday, Wednesday, middle of the week.

460
00:19:17.902 --> 00:19:19.592
As their bodies are detoxifying

461
00:19:19.592 --> 00:19:23.572
from caffeine, sugar.

462
00:19:23.572 --> 00:19:25.299
Just junk food.

463
00:19:25.299 --> 00:19:29.190
And that actually, just all the chlorophyll from the algaes

464
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:31.515
that I would add to my formula, and the enzymes,

465
00:19:31.515 --> 00:19:34.011
would really help to minimize those effects.

466
00:19:34.011 --> 00:19:35.780
So that people would,

467
00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.170
detoxification does not have to entail suffering.

468
00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:39.194
I really don't believe that.

469
00:19:39.194 --> 00:19:40.080
<v Woman>Thank you for saying that.</v>

470
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.381
Because I'm under that impression.

471
00:19:41.381 --> 00:19:43.983
I've tried it a few times, it was painful.

472
00:19:43.983 --> 00:19:44.719
<v ->Right.</v>

473
00:19:44.719 --> 00:19:47.173
Yeah, and I think that the strategies

474
00:19:47.173 --> 00:19:48.759
that are often used now, where people are

475
00:19:48.759 --> 00:19:51.717
doing these heroic juice fasts and cleanses are,

476
00:19:51.717 --> 00:19:53.605
they absolutely entail some agony.

477
00:19:53.605 --> 00:19:57.509
And sure, it's arguable that they're character building,

478
00:19:57.509 --> 00:19:58.648
but yes--

479
00:19:58.648 --> 00:20:00.332
<v Woman>But you can do it another way, you're saying.</v>

480
00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:01.997
<v ->Yes, absolutely, absolutely.</v>

481
00:20:01.997 --> 00:20:05.357
Just living a more cleansing lifestyle in general.

482
00:20:05.357 --> 00:20:07.265
And eating the cleaning foods.

483
00:20:07.265 --> 00:20:10.797
And really just taking it to another level

484
00:20:10.797 --> 00:20:12.077
with your overall lifestyle,

485
00:20:12.077 --> 00:20:16.140
so you don't have to do this crazy swinging back and forth

486
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.328
between heroic detoxes and then--

487
00:20:19.328 --> 00:20:20.513
<v Woman>Over consumption.</v>

488
00:20:20.513 --> 00:20:21.644
<v Billy>Debaucherous retoxes.</v>

489
00:20:21.644 --> 00:20:22.465
<v Woman>Exactly.</v>

490
00:20:22.465 --> 00:20:24.171
<v ->You know, it's kind of, it's just this--</v>

491
00:20:24.171 --> 00:20:25.427
<v Woman>And we know people that do that.</v>

492
00:20:25.427 --> 00:20:26.377
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

493
00:20:26.377 --> 00:20:28.463
<v Woman>Yeah, moderation is key here.</v>

494
00:20:28.463 --> 00:20:29.819
And some education.

495
00:20:29.819 --> 00:20:31.696
And did you find it in that,

496
00:20:31.696 --> 00:20:33.381
because you ended up in this field

497
00:20:33.381 --> 00:20:35.290
where you're really focused heavily on greens,

498
00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:37.200
Billy's Greens,

499
00:20:39.457 --> 00:20:43.338
where did the chlorophyll, and the E3 live,

500
00:20:43.338 --> 00:20:45.290
and the algaes, where did everything,

501
00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:46.709
how does that play into it?

502
00:20:46.709 --> 00:20:48.011
What have you noticed?

503
00:20:48.011 --> 00:20:49.291
I mean, obviously, you've noticed a lot,

504
00:20:49.291 --> 00:20:50.549
because this is your business.

505
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:52.660
<v ->Well, I would have to say that I feel strongly</v>

506
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.863
algae is the single most important

507
00:20:55.602 --> 00:20:59.368
super food blend in my formula.

508
00:20:59.368 --> 00:21:02.205
That I really, deeply believe in the algaes.

509
00:21:02.205 --> 00:21:05.802
That they are tremendously cleansing,

510
00:21:05.802 --> 00:21:08.382
balancing, nourishing foods.

511
00:21:08.382 --> 00:21:11.913
That first of all, it's, I think, helpful to consider

512
00:21:11.913 --> 00:21:14.761
that algae was the first life on Earth.

513
00:21:14.761 --> 00:21:17.417
And this it's just a blend of sunlight,

514
00:21:17.417 --> 00:21:19.560
water, temperature, minerals.

515
00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:23.431
And that it just produces, voila, life.

516
00:21:23.431 --> 00:21:24.518
That's wonderful.

517
00:21:24.518 --> 00:21:25.392
<v Woman>It is.</v>

518
00:21:25.392 --> 00:21:28.561
<v ->And that there are many kinds of algae, of course.</v>

519
00:21:28.561 --> 00:21:29.771
But that...

520
00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:33.935
Algae's like spirulina and chlorella

521
00:21:33.935 --> 00:21:37.977
and klamath lake algae have such marvelous impact.

522
00:21:37.977 --> 00:21:41.307
that it's the chlorophyll that makes it so dark green.

523
00:21:41.307 --> 00:21:43.877
Like all living green things.

524
00:21:43.877 --> 00:21:47.471
Leaves, grass, it's all chlorophyll that makes it green.

525
00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:49.891
And chlorophyll is just,

526
00:21:50.564 --> 00:21:52.671
is body cleanser number one.

527
00:21:52.671 --> 00:21:57.449
That chlorophyll is a strong, ionically charged molecule.

528
00:21:57.449 --> 00:22:00.565
That when you're taking it internally from

529
00:22:01.505 --> 00:22:04.506
green juices, algaes,

530
00:22:04.506 --> 00:22:07.141
green vegetables, leafy greens,

531
00:22:07.141 --> 00:22:09.765
that it does really pull things out of the body

532
00:22:09.765 --> 00:22:11.152
that just don't really belong there.

533
00:22:11.152 --> 00:22:14.320
And it's really helping to bring oxygen in.

534
00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.143
Oxygen is the single most important thing

535
00:22:16.143 --> 00:22:17.626
we put into our bodies.

536
00:22:17.626 --> 00:22:19.257
<v Woman>Absolutely, and this has to be</v>

537
00:22:19.257 --> 00:22:21.509
the primary healing component of it.

538
00:22:21.509 --> 00:22:22.318
<v ->It is.</v>

539
00:22:22.318 --> 00:22:23.972
<v Woman>Just getting oxygen back into the cells.</v>

540
00:22:23.972 --> 00:22:24.858
<v ->Right, right.</v>

541
00:22:24.858 --> 00:22:27.181
Its pulling the funk out,

542
00:22:27.181 --> 00:22:28.804
and putting the good stuff back in.

543
00:22:28.804 --> 00:22:30.712
That oxygen is number one.

544
00:22:30.712 --> 00:22:32.130
And that, thank goodness,

545
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.998
we're just swimming in an ocean of oxygen, of course.

546
00:22:34.998 --> 00:22:37.377
And we'll always have enough.

547
00:22:37.377 --> 00:22:40.055
But we do get oxygen from foods as well.

548
00:22:40.055 --> 00:22:41.468
And that

549
00:22:42.209 --> 00:22:45.707
algae does play into the overall

550
00:22:45.707 --> 00:22:49.459
oxygen saturation optimization, and--

551
00:22:49.459 --> 00:22:50.893
<v Woman>And you must have been watching this</v>

552
00:22:50.893 --> 00:22:52.118
in the clients you were working with

553
00:22:52.118 --> 00:22:54.261
as they were optimizing their health and their performance.

554
00:22:54.261 --> 00:22:56.042
<v ->I could see a difference in their performance.</v>

555
00:22:56.042 --> 00:22:58.165
People would hike better.

556
00:23:01.246 --> 00:23:04.903
The program has some agony, I don't wanna. (laughs)

557
00:23:04.903 --> 00:23:06.428
<v Woman>Yeah, I mean, we're not focused on that.</v>

558
00:23:06.428 --> 00:23:07.559
I just kinda wanted to see

559
00:23:07.559 --> 00:23:09.351
what you noticed by way of improvement.

560
00:23:09.351 --> 00:23:11.399
<v ->Right, well, less agony. (laughs)</v>

561
00:23:11.399 --> 00:23:13.041
<v Woman>Yeah, less agony, there you go.</v>

562
00:23:13.041 --> 00:23:13.959
Okay.

563
00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:15.484
<v Billy>So.</v>
<v Woman>Less agony.</v>

564
00:23:15.484 --> 00:23:18.613
<v ->Yes, people would be able to just hike.</v>

565
00:23:18.613 --> 00:23:19.798
They had more energy.

566
00:23:19.798 --> 00:23:20.628
(woman vocalizes understanding)

567
00:23:20.628 --> 00:23:21.348
Yeah, so.

568
00:23:21.348 --> 00:23:22.051
<v Woman>Very good.</v>

569
00:23:22.051 --> 00:23:23.459
And then, any kind of healing properties

570
00:23:23.459 --> 00:23:26.499
that were undertones to those stories?

571
00:23:26.499 --> 00:23:30.584
<v ->Well, since, also, oxygen is the single most</v>

572
00:23:30.584 --> 00:23:32.919
alkaline forming thing,

573
00:23:32.919 --> 00:23:35.053
getting more oxygen into our bloodstream,

574
00:23:35.053 --> 00:23:38.061
into our tissues, into our bodies is crucial

575
00:23:38.061 --> 00:23:39.832
for all healing.

576
00:23:39.832 --> 00:23:42.593
Healing all malaties in life.

577
00:23:42.593 --> 00:23:45.666
So oxygen is number one.

578
00:23:45.666 --> 00:23:49.197
That it's the energizer, it's the revitalizer.

579
00:23:49.197 --> 00:23:50.806
It's also the healer.

580
00:23:50.806 --> 00:23:54.743
That it's really just the most important thing

581
00:23:54.743 --> 00:23:58.526
we're putting into our bodies for every organ action

582
00:23:58.526 --> 00:24:00.348
and function, for everything.

583
00:24:00.348 --> 00:24:03.280
And I really am just touched

584
00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.106
by the message from that.

585
00:24:06.106 --> 00:24:10.425
That it's the invisible things that impact us most.

586
00:24:10.425 --> 00:24:11.684
<v Woman>Yes, it is.</v>

587
00:24:11.684 --> 00:24:12.911
<v ->So it comes back to our thought.</v>

588
00:24:12.911 --> 00:24:15.214
And just, anyway, you know what I love to talk about.

589
00:24:15.214 --> 00:24:16.751
<v Woman>Yeah, I know what you're saying.</v>

590
00:24:16.751 --> 00:24:18.425
All the invisibles are factors that are

591
00:24:18.425 --> 00:24:20.377
keeping us vital and alive.

592
00:24:20.377 --> 00:24:23.650
And we're using physicality through foods and the like.

593
00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:24.220
<v ->Yes.</v>

594
00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.693
<v Woman>To be able to transfer this into our system</v>

595
00:24:27.693 --> 00:24:28.750
and cells.
<v Billy>We're using</v>

596
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:32.234
the tools that the invisible is blessing us with to use.

597
00:24:32.234 --> 00:24:33.067
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

598
00:24:33.067 --> 00:24:35.401
<v ->The invisible's saying, "Here, use this, do this,</v>

599
00:24:35.401 --> 00:24:39.177
try this tool, use this super food, take this herb."

600
00:24:39.177 --> 00:24:41.555
<v Woman>Yes, and one thing I notice with people who do</v>

601
00:24:41.555 --> 00:24:43.997
and have really committed to having

602
00:24:43.997 --> 00:24:47.415
a lot of oxygen saturated foods,

603
00:24:47.415 --> 00:24:49.505
i.e. greens in particular,

604
00:24:49.505 --> 00:24:52.770
in their diets is, it does seem to have this,

605
00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:55.980
this is kind of the big deal now because the baby boomers

606
00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.400
are afraid of getting old and wrinkled and so forth,

607
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.310
so anti-aging has become a big subject.

608
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:04.479
But the reality is, having oxygen in your system

609
00:25:04.479 --> 00:25:07.093
is the number one way to slow down the process

610
00:25:07.093 --> 00:25:10.453
of the body, essentially, degenerating.

611
00:25:10.453 --> 00:25:11.429
<v ->Right.</v>

612
00:25:12.235 --> 00:25:14.495
<v Woman>That's why all you guys look so young.</v>

613
00:25:14.495 --> 00:25:16.810
<v ->So, moral of the story is (woman laughs)</v>

614
00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:17.824
breath a lot.

615
00:25:17.824 --> 00:25:19.540
<v Woman>Breath a lot. (both laugh)</v>

616
00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:20.658
Breath a lot.

617
00:25:21.718 --> 00:25:24.385
And consume foods that allow your body to breath

618
00:25:24.385 --> 00:25:26.037
in a different way, and allow your immune system

619
00:25:26.037 --> 00:25:30.413
to function, and inflammation to be reduced or eliminated.

620
00:25:30.413 --> 00:25:31.413
<v ->Equally important.</v>

621
00:25:31.413 --> 00:25:33.442
<v Woman>Yeah, all of the above.</v>

622
00:25:34.882 --> 00:25:36.577
There's something about your greens though

623
00:25:36.577 --> 00:25:37.429
that are quite different.

624
00:25:37.429 --> 00:25:39.148
I've done a number of different kinds of greens.

625
00:25:39.148 --> 00:25:41.025
Some of them are really quite lovely,

626
00:25:41.025 --> 00:25:44.978
and do have energizing properties to them, but,

627
00:25:44.978 --> 00:25:47.111
and I don't wanna make this sound like an infomercial,

628
00:25:47.111 --> 00:25:49.288
but the reason I wanted to do this interview with you

629
00:25:49.288 --> 00:25:51.987
is 'cause I'm fully aware that this oxygenation problem

630
00:25:51.987 --> 00:25:53.917
is a big issue for humanity.

631
00:25:53.917 --> 00:25:55.772
We're going through big changes.

632
00:25:55.772 --> 00:25:58.289
We need to be optimized on every level

633
00:25:58.289 --> 00:26:01.256
to be abe to maintain our immune systems now.

634
00:26:01.256 --> 00:26:04.976
And when I met you just a little over a month ago,

635
00:26:04.976 --> 00:26:07.376
you wanna shoo him away, (both laugh)

636
00:26:07.376 --> 00:26:09.510
when I met you a little over a month ago

637
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:12.293
at the Greens Festival in San Francisco,

638
00:26:12.293 --> 00:26:14.181
first of all, it was your vitality

639
00:26:14.181 --> 00:26:16.257
and the partner that you work with in this,

640
00:26:16.257 --> 00:26:19.831
and Mario's vitality that really shown through.

641
00:26:19.831 --> 00:26:21.421
And caught my attention enough

642
00:26:21.421 --> 00:26:23.553
to take a little drink of your greens.

643
00:26:23.553 --> 00:26:25.526
And I thought, "Now is the time to cover this subject."

644
00:26:25.526 --> 00:26:26.849
And that's why we're here.

645
00:26:26.849 --> 00:26:30.732
There was a euphoric quality about how I felt

646
00:26:30.732 --> 00:26:32.185
after drinking them.

647
00:26:32.185 --> 00:26:35.423
Now, what is it you've been doing and tinkering with,

648
00:26:35.423 --> 00:26:38.260
my allusion to alchemy in the beginning,

649
00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:39.455
what have you been doing?

650
00:26:39.455 --> 00:26:42.111
What are you putting in here to create this blend

651
00:26:42.111 --> 00:26:44.947
that has this effect on myself and others?

652
00:26:46.035 --> 00:26:48.019
<v ->Well, I'd love to take the credit for being able to</v>

653
00:26:48.019 --> 00:26:50.184
figure that out, but I can't.

654
00:26:50.184 --> 00:26:53.458
It's mother nature, it's the spirit,

655
00:26:53.458 --> 00:26:55.165
it's the help from the ashram.

656
00:26:55.165 --> 00:26:58.461
Because what I would just get to do is

657
00:26:58.461 --> 00:27:00.381
try different blends--

658
00:27:00.381 --> 00:27:01.361
<v Woman>Right.</v>

659
00:27:01.361 --> 00:27:03.036
<v Billy>That, well, first of all,</v>

660
00:27:03.036 --> 00:27:04.524
each of the different blends in the formula

661
00:27:04.524 --> 00:27:05.312
(woman vocalizes understanding)

662
00:27:05.312 --> 00:27:07.104
and all of the super foods out there

663
00:27:07.104 --> 00:27:10.091
that are in all of the formulas are all good.

664
00:27:10.091 --> 00:27:10.805
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

665
00:27:10.805 --> 00:27:13.321
<v ->Now, I have to say that</v>

666
00:27:14.874 --> 00:27:16.825
nutrition is an individual thing.

667
00:27:16.825 --> 00:27:18.351
That every body type is different.

668
00:27:18.351 --> 00:27:19.288
And you have to see--

669
00:27:19.288 --> 00:27:20.751
<v Woman>So, not everyone would feel euphoric</v>

670
00:27:20.751 --> 00:27:22.815
on your greens like I did?

671
00:27:23.428 --> 00:27:24.846
<v ->Only 99%.</v>

672
00:27:24.846 --> 00:27:27.320
<v Woman>(laughs) 99, right.</v>
<v Billy>Yes.</v>

673
00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:30.508
But actually there is just some truth

674
00:27:30.508 --> 00:27:34.903
to diet being a totally unique thing.

675
00:27:34.903 --> 00:27:38.466
That what healing super foods make you feel good

676
00:27:38.466 --> 00:27:40.215
are gonna be different from

677
00:27:40.215 --> 00:27:42.528
what would make somebody else feel good.

678
00:27:42.528 --> 00:27:46.657
And that, again, there are many super foods that

679
00:27:46.657 --> 00:27:48.693
are universal and that are good for everybody.

680
00:27:48.693 --> 00:27:50.101
<v Woman>What are the unique properties?</v>

681
00:27:50.101 --> 00:27:51.849
You have a lot of different foods in there.

682
00:27:51.849 --> 00:27:53.044
It's not just greens.

683
00:27:53.044 --> 00:27:54.121
<v ->Right, right.</v>

684
00:27:54.121 --> 00:27:55.891
<v Woman>And they're obviously working synergistically.</v>

685
00:27:55.891 --> 00:27:56.627
<v ->Yes.</v>

686
00:27:56.627 --> 00:27:58.291
<v Woman>So explain that, what's going on?</v>

687
00:27:58.291 --> 00:27:59.304
<v Billy>You nailed it.</v>
<v Woman>Why did you</v>

688
00:27:59.304 --> 00:28:00.447
choose it?
<v Billy>You nailed it</v>

689
00:28:00.447 --> 00:28:01.823
right there, it's a synergy.

690
00:28:01.823 --> 00:28:06.232
That all of these foods individually, very, very powerful.

691
00:28:07.058 --> 00:28:11.367
That individually, spirulina for example, just,

692
00:28:11.367 --> 00:28:14.577
it's loaded in B12, beta-Carotene.

693
00:28:14.577 --> 00:28:16.081
It has some phenylethylamine.

694
00:28:16.081 --> 00:28:19.858
It's an incredibly detoxifying, balancing,

695
00:28:19.858 --> 00:28:21.948
oxygen saturating food.

696
00:28:21.948 --> 00:28:25.171
But blend that,

697
00:28:25.171 --> 00:28:28.767
put that spirulina with some enzymes

698
00:28:28.767 --> 00:28:31.774
and some probiotics, whoa.

699
00:28:31.774 --> 00:28:35.304
Now we're talking like the big guns. (laughs)

700
00:28:35.304 --> 00:28:36.060
<v Woman>Explain that,</v>

701
00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.212
explain how it works synergistically.

702
00:28:37.212 --> 00:28:39.452
<v ->Big guns probably isn't the best way to refer to it.</v>

703
00:28:39.452 --> 00:28:40.528
<v Woman>No, that's okay.</v>

704
00:28:40.528 --> 00:28:41.606
(Billy laughs)

705
00:28:41.606 --> 00:28:44.095
I think we all understand what you're saying.

706
00:28:44.095 --> 00:28:46.831
Explain the synergy of that, and why that's so important.

707
00:28:46.831 --> 00:28:48.335
<v ->Okay, here's the thing.</v>

708
00:28:48.335 --> 00:28:52.025
These foods, individually, are all very digestible.

709
00:28:52.025 --> 00:28:55.757
But when you add some enzymes,

710
00:28:55.757 --> 00:28:58.381
you're actually helping that food to break down more.

711
00:28:58.381 --> 00:29:01.186
And to become even more bio-available.

712
00:29:01.186 --> 00:29:03.297
It's why I also add the ginger.

713
00:29:03.297 --> 00:29:06.551
Ginger fires up your spleen.

714
00:29:06.551 --> 00:29:10.863
You spleen is like your body's heater.

715
00:29:11.306 --> 00:29:12.415
You turn your spleen up,

716
00:29:12.415 --> 00:29:14.312
it raises your whole body's temperature.

717
00:29:14.312 --> 00:29:16.540
Actually, did you know low body temperature

718
00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:18.097
is a problem for many people?

719
00:29:18.097 --> 00:29:19.784
It's so easy to fix.

720
00:29:19.784 --> 00:29:22.695
Mother Nature's like, "Here you go, try this.

721
00:29:22.695 --> 00:29:24.199
Have this warm ginger tea."

722
00:29:24.199 --> 00:29:25.137
<v Woman>Ginger, yeah.</v>

723
00:29:25.137 --> 00:29:27.452
<v ->Yeah, and then it raises your body's temperature</v>

724
00:29:27.452 --> 00:29:30.555
just enough so that you have warm hands and feet

725
00:29:30.555 --> 00:29:31.611
all the time.

726
00:29:31.611 --> 00:29:35.356
And here's the cool thing about adding it with other foods,

727
00:29:35.356 --> 00:29:37.851
is that when you fire up your spleen,

728
00:29:37.851 --> 00:29:40.209
it's like a pressure cooker under your stomach.

729
00:29:40.209 --> 00:29:42.673
Your stomach better extracts nutrients

730
00:29:42.673 --> 00:29:45.009
from all the other foods that you're having it with.

731
00:29:45.009 --> 00:29:46.266
<v Woman>Oh, interesting, okay.</v>

732
00:29:46.266 --> 00:29:48.718
<v ->So, I know I'm telling you all my secrets now. (laughs)</v>

733
00:29:48.718 --> 00:29:50.104
<v Woman>But that's what I want to know.</v>

734
00:29:50.104 --> 00:29:51.866
We need to know the wherefore behind it.

735
00:29:51.866 --> 00:29:53.167
And why.
<v Billy>That here's,</v>

736
00:29:53.167 --> 00:29:54.425
the thing is that I've been able to

737
00:29:54.425 --> 00:29:57.783
get these blends of super foods just right

738
00:29:57.783 --> 00:30:00.525
so there's a synergy, as you called it.

739
00:30:00.525 --> 00:30:03.363
It's a synergistic blend.

740
00:30:03.363 --> 00:30:06.551
Where all these foods are optimizing one another.

741
00:30:06.551 --> 00:30:08.429
<v Woman>And, yes.</v>
<v Billy>It's a whole</v>

742
00:30:08.429 --> 00:30:10.433
catalytic synergy.

743
00:30:10.433 --> 00:30:11.663
<v Woman>Well, let's talk about the--</v>

744
00:30:11.663 --> 00:30:12.593
<v ->I could go on. (laughs)</v>

745
00:30:12.593 --> 00:30:13.712
<v Woman>I know you're excited, and this is good.</v>

746
00:30:13.712 --> 00:30:14.650
You love what you do.

747
00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:15.899
But let's talk about the probiotic.

748
00:30:15.899 --> 00:30:18.011
You said you add enzymes and probiotics.

749
00:30:18.011 --> 00:30:19.184
So talk about that element of,

750
00:30:19.184 --> 00:30:22.053
now how does that fit into this synergistic blend?

751
00:30:22.053 --> 00:30:25.487
<v ->Well, really, so much of the formula</v>

752
00:30:25.487 --> 00:30:28.922
is targeted toward building digestive health.

753
00:30:28.922 --> 00:30:29.914
<v Woman>(vocalizes agreement)</v>

754
00:30:29.914 --> 00:30:31.460
Which is where all health begins, isn't it?

755
00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:33.422
<v ->It's one of the foundations.</v>

756
00:30:33.422 --> 00:30:34.073
<v Woman>Yeah.</v>

757
00:30:34.073 --> 00:30:35.129
<v ->It's like,</v>

758
00:30:35.129 --> 00:30:37.573
it's almost as pivotal as oxygen.

759
00:30:37.573 --> 00:30:39.843
It's so crucial, because it's where

760
00:30:39.843 --> 00:30:42.062
you're extracting nutrition, and also,

761
00:30:42.062 --> 00:30:45.358
your body gets rid of 95% of it's toxicity

762
00:30:45.358 --> 00:30:48.750
through the gastrointestinal system.

763
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:49.988
So you wanna optimize that.

764
00:30:49.988 --> 00:30:51.086
You wanna have that healthy.

765
00:30:51.086 --> 00:30:54.229
It's a great place to start for building,

766
00:30:54.229 --> 00:30:57.032
and optimizing health on every level.

767
00:30:57.034 --> 00:30:59.582
<v Woman>I, in fact, went, about 25 or 30 years ago,</v>

768
00:30:59.582 --> 00:31:02.857
I was in Germany in the forest. (laughs)

769
00:31:02.857 --> 00:31:05.779
I'm interviewing a prominent physicist at the time,

770
00:31:05.779 --> 00:31:08.408
who had been introducing

771
00:31:08.408 --> 00:31:11.746
frequency types of modalities for healing,

772
00:31:11.746 --> 00:31:14.306
but he was just a wild genius.

773
00:31:14.306 --> 00:31:15.788
He's since passed on.

774
00:31:15.788 --> 00:31:17.762
And at the end of our conversation he said,

775
00:31:17.762 --> 00:31:19.776
"There's only one thing that matters.

776
00:31:19.776 --> 00:31:22.433
Digestive systems have to be healthy."

777
00:31:22.433 --> 00:31:24.225
And that is where all health begins.

778
00:31:24.225 --> 00:31:26.071
And I never forgot that.

779
00:31:26.071 --> 00:31:27.958
He was so passionate in what he knew,

780
00:31:27.958 --> 00:31:29.015
and he was so brilliant.

781
00:31:29.015 --> 00:31:31.820
I mean, a lot of his work has lived on.

782
00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.409
And that's what he was saying too.

783
00:31:33.409 --> 00:31:34.668
Yeah.
<v Billy>Yes.</v>

784
00:31:34.668 --> 00:31:35.947
<v Woman>And that's the part we ignore.</v>

785
00:31:35.947 --> 00:31:36.896
We just throw junk down there.

786
00:31:36.896 --> 00:31:39.456
And then people throw, you know,

787
00:31:39.456 --> 00:31:43.724
Ex-Lax or whatever behind it to make it move out and,

788
00:31:43.724 --> 00:31:45.569
I mean, we'd handle it in such a horrible way.

789
00:31:45.569 --> 00:31:48.640
<v ->It works, but it is going to entail more suffering.</v>

790
00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.219
<v Woman>It's such an abusive way.</v>

791
00:31:50.219 --> 00:31:51.029
<v ->Yes. (laughs)</v>

792
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:54.528
<v Woman>So, you're looking at introducing these things in</v>

793
00:31:54.528 --> 00:31:57.599
so that our digestive system can very naturally start,

794
00:31:57.599 --> 00:31:59.541
I assume, not only detoxing,

795
00:31:59.541 --> 00:32:01.248
but maybe even repairing itself?

796
00:32:01.248 --> 00:32:02.389
<v ->Getting stronger.</v>

797
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:03.348
<v Woman>Yes.</v>
<v Billy>Yes.</v>

798
00:32:03.348 --> 00:32:06.314
Just better breaking down foods and eliminating.

799
00:32:06.314 --> 00:32:07.775
(woman vocalizes agreement)
Yep.

800
00:32:07.775 --> 00:32:11.188
<v Woman>And so, you add in there also,</v>

801
00:32:11.188 --> 00:32:12.786
again, I noticed this because it's something

802
00:32:12.786 --> 00:32:15.145
that I've been taking and just adore,

803
00:32:15.145 --> 00:32:17.320
I believe you have some maca in there, don't you?

804
00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.707
(Billy vocalizes confirmation)
Some maca.

805
00:32:18.707 --> 00:32:19.826
<v ->Yes, that's right.</v>

806
00:32:19.826 --> 00:32:20.798
<v Woman>And other super foods</v>

807
00:32:20.798 --> 00:32:22.483
that really boost energy levels as well.

808
00:32:22.483 --> 00:32:23.763
<v ->Yes, yeah, I'd be happy to talk</v>

809
00:32:23.763 --> 00:32:25.384
about any of the individual super foods.

810
00:32:25.384 --> 00:32:26.812
<v Woman>Yeah, talk about it a little bit,</v>

811
00:32:26.812 --> 00:32:28.232
because we're all being exposed to them.

812
00:32:28.232 --> 00:32:30.504
And I take it individually as a powder form

813
00:32:30.504 --> 00:32:31.644
and shakes in the morning,

814
00:32:31.644 --> 00:32:35.143
but let's talk about maca and some of the berries.

815
00:32:35.143 --> 00:32:37.458
Because I think there's some confusion

816
00:32:37.458 --> 00:32:39.376
around some of the berries.
<v Billy>Okay.</v>

817
00:32:39.376 --> 00:32:40.860
<v Woman>For example, like the acai</v>

818
00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:41.991
and also goji berries.

819
00:32:41.991 --> 00:32:44.922
And so let's talk about berries and maca for a bit,

820
00:32:44.922 --> 00:32:46.118
and what they add too.

821
00:32:46.118 --> 00:32:50.709
<v ->Okay, we should, because they are important ingredients.</v>

822
00:32:50.709 --> 00:32:53.534
They are super foods that I believe in.

823
00:32:53.534 --> 00:32:57.970
Now, maca, I put in there for just adrenal nourishment.

824
00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:01.565
Maca can be used in a number of ways.

825
00:33:01.565 --> 00:33:05.158
It's a natural energizer, it's quite a nice food.

826
00:33:05.158 --> 00:33:07.067
What it is, what is maca.

827
00:33:07.067 --> 00:33:10.164
It's a cruciferous vegetable root.

828
00:33:10.982 --> 00:33:13.136
It comes from South America,

829
00:33:13.136 --> 00:33:17.168
where it grows in the higher elevation regions.

830
00:33:17.168 --> 00:33:18.565
Kind of like a potato.

831
00:33:18.565 --> 00:33:19.760
And the local people eat it.

832
00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.839
It's a regular part of their fare.

833
00:33:21.839 --> 00:33:24.027
They just eat the whole food.

834
00:33:24.027 --> 00:33:26.693
And in the western world, in the last decade,

835
00:33:26.693 --> 00:33:28.399
it's become popular just because

836
00:33:28.399 --> 00:33:31.493
it's a very nourishing food that,

837
00:33:31.493 --> 00:33:33.445
you nourish your adrenals,

838
00:33:33.445 --> 00:33:36.740
and that just helps boost your overall energy.

839
00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.682
The way maca works is that it does have

840
00:33:38.682 --> 00:33:41.914
a similar nutrient constituency of what your body

841
00:33:41.914 --> 00:33:44.964
just naturally stores in your adrenals.

842
00:33:44.964 --> 00:33:48.057
And so, your adrenals are just kind of like

843
00:33:48.057 --> 00:33:52.121
your turbo in a way, it just gets your vitality up.

844
00:33:52.121 --> 00:33:56.439
And that many of us use caffeine

845
00:33:56.439 --> 00:33:57.719
to get that boost.

846
00:33:57.719 --> 00:34:00.183
And it's working, caffeine is working in a different manner.

847
00:34:00.183 --> 00:34:03.617
Caffeine is working by juicing your adrenals.

848
00:34:03.617 --> 00:34:04.972
It's a stimulant.

849
00:34:04.972 --> 00:34:08.427
Whereas maca is working by putting that nutrition back in.

850
00:34:08.427 --> 00:34:10.358
<v Woman>One drains and the other feeds, yeah.</v>

851
00:34:10.358 --> 00:34:14.014
<v ->Now, there is number of different maca products out there,</v>

852
00:34:14.014 --> 00:34:17.321
where some of them are extracts that do work more

853
00:34:17.321 --> 00:34:18.931
in a stimulant manner.

854
00:34:18.931 --> 00:34:22.269
But the whole food option, in small amounts,

855
00:34:22.269 --> 00:34:24.563
is just perfect nourishment for really just

856
00:34:24.563 --> 00:34:25.800
nourishing your adrenals,

857
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.816
so you don't need those heroic stimulants anymore

858
00:34:27.816 --> 00:34:29.949
to give that spark.

859
00:34:29.949 --> 00:34:32.296
I think it's a great thing to have in the morning, I do.

860
00:34:32.296 --> 00:34:36.562
I say maca, and if you want caffeine, just, less.

861
00:34:36.562 --> 00:34:40.221
And the two together, I think, is just a more balanced fit.

862
00:34:40.221 --> 00:34:42.397
<v Woman>Good, well, what about the goji berries now?</v>

863
00:34:42.397 --> 00:34:44.532
Or the berries, the acai or the goji.

864
00:34:44.532 --> 00:34:49.227
<v ->Okay, so the exotic fruits in my formula,</v>

865
00:34:49.227 --> 00:34:51.637
the goji, the mangosteen, the acai,

866
00:34:51.637 --> 00:34:56.008
the amla berries, these are important foods.

867
00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:59.010
There is just a small amount in my formula

868
00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:02.121
of those four exotic fruits.

869
00:35:02.121 --> 00:35:03.486
They're in there, basically,

870
00:35:03.486 --> 00:35:07.753
just to get some antioxidant value into the formula.

871
00:35:07.753 --> 00:35:09.214
You're getting some antioxidants from

872
00:35:09.214 --> 00:35:11.349
some of the other foods, but

873
00:35:12.179 --> 00:35:14.931
the mangosteen, I've really fallen in love with all of them.

874
00:35:14.931 --> 00:35:19.207
They all serve a very individual, unique purpose.

875
00:35:19.207 --> 00:35:22.759
That just a little bit of those foods is just

876
00:35:22.759 --> 00:35:24.306
such an incredible impact.

877
00:35:24.306 --> 00:35:26.289
Why these foods in my formula have such an impact

878
00:35:26.289 --> 00:35:28.956
is they're also extracts.

879
00:35:28.956 --> 00:35:31.174
The other foods in my formula are the whole foods.

880
00:35:31.174 --> 00:35:33.734
But the reason I use the extracts with the berries

881
00:35:33.734 --> 00:35:35.622
is that adding the whole berry would actually

882
00:35:35.622 --> 00:35:37.286
add some sugar to my formula.

883
00:35:37.286 --> 00:35:38.875
And I don't want any sugar in my formula.

884
00:35:38.875 --> 00:35:41.104
It's a zero sugar formula.

885
00:35:41.104 --> 00:35:44.157
And so, these extract fruits

886
00:35:44.157 --> 00:35:46.418
are just incredibly powerful

887
00:35:46.418 --> 00:35:48.349
for reducing inflammation in the body.

888
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:51.538
That's really why I add antioxidants to my formulas.

889
00:35:51.538 --> 00:35:56.145
To basically eliminate free radical activity in the body.

890
00:35:56.145 --> 00:35:57.068
So...

891
00:35:58.503 --> 00:36:00.967
One example was, with the mangosteen,

892
00:36:00.967 --> 00:36:04.081
I actually had these because I was hiking

893
00:36:04.081 --> 00:36:05.478
every day at the ashram.

894
00:36:05.478 --> 00:36:07.538
I had these dun rashes on the backs of my hands

895
00:36:07.538 --> 00:36:09.788
that wouldn't go away, I using vitamin E,

896
00:36:09.788 --> 00:36:13.158
I was using sunscreens, sunblocks,

897
00:36:13.158 --> 00:36:16.007
olive oil products, and nothing would take it away.

898
00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:17.775
I start eating mangosteen,

899
00:36:17.775 --> 00:36:20.494
and the free radical damage from the sun, boom, gone.

900
00:36:20.494 --> 00:36:21.412
<v Woman>Oh, interesting.</v>

901
00:36:21.412 --> 00:36:22.625
<v ->It was awesome, it was awesome.</v>

902
00:36:22.625 --> 00:36:25.235
So that's how I fell in love with that one, but--

903
00:36:25.235 --> 00:36:27.632
<v Woman>Okay, so we've got the antioxidants.</v>

904
00:36:27.632 --> 00:36:30.639
We have the symbiotic effect of the enzymes

905
00:36:30.639 --> 00:36:33.327
and the probiotics with the greens,

906
00:36:33.327 --> 00:36:36.773
oxygenating the body, dumping all the toxins from the body,

907
00:36:36.773 --> 00:36:37.828
So--
<v BIlly>Yeah, you got it.</v>

908
00:36:37.828 --> 00:36:38.763
<v Woman>You kinda have it.</v>

909
00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:40.555
I mean, and so,

910
00:36:40.555 --> 00:36:42.572
personally, I'm really exciting to begin

911
00:36:42.572 --> 00:36:44.321
the next phase of my own journey in this.

912
00:36:44.321 --> 00:36:46.924
Because I've been a dabbler in greens for a long time,

913
00:36:46.924 --> 00:36:49.035
but I haven't been super committed to them.

914
00:36:49.035 --> 00:36:51.808
And I feel that the time has come

915
00:36:51.808 --> 00:36:53.194
for me to make a committment.

916
00:36:53.194 --> 00:36:55.892
Because I've been, just on an esoteric level,

917
00:36:55.892 --> 00:36:58.783
in meditation, given information,

918
00:36:58.783 --> 00:37:01.283
especially over the last year that it's,

919
00:37:01.283 --> 00:37:03.809
that is what we're moving toward as a species.

920
00:37:03.809 --> 00:37:05.580
And this is a really big part of it,

921
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:09.636
is to start incorporating greens in fluid form

922
00:37:09.636 --> 00:37:11.343
regularly into the body.

923
00:37:11.343 --> 00:37:13.679
And I see now, from this conversation,

924
00:37:13.679 --> 00:37:16.077
why I've been given that information.

925
00:37:16.077 --> 00:37:19.714
<v ->Our body's are starving for just this awesome nutrition.</v>

926
00:37:19.714 --> 00:37:22.092
That, yes, it's getting the right calories,

927
00:37:22.092 --> 00:37:23.426
it's getting the right fuel,

928
00:37:23.426 --> 00:37:26.707
but nutrients from super foods,

929
00:37:26.707 --> 00:37:30.131
that nutrient density, that is energy.

930
00:37:30.131 --> 00:37:31.432
<v Woman>Yes.</v>
<v Billy>It is.</v>

931
00:37:31.432 --> 00:37:35.294
And it's optimizing our bodies to just be more efficient.

932
00:37:35.294 --> 00:37:35.986
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

933
00:37:35.986 --> 00:37:38.205
<v ->And to just run better, smoother.</v>

934
00:37:38.205 --> 00:37:40.888
And that then you just don't need as much

935
00:37:40.888 --> 00:37:43.233
of the other fuel, you know.

936
00:37:43.233 --> 00:37:46.784
Your body has a more satisfied, satiated felling in general.

937
00:37:46.784 --> 00:37:49.450
Just from getting the stuff that it's really craving

938
00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:50.827
and hungry for.

939
00:37:50.827 --> 00:37:52.191
<v Woman>Well, besides Cindy Crawford,</v>

940
00:37:52.191 --> 00:37:55.092
who's there saying, "Billy, thank you," (laughs)

941
00:37:55.092 --> 00:37:58.225
tell us about maybe a couple of other instances

942
00:37:58.225 --> 00:38:00.242
of people you've seen, that have contacted you,

943
00:38:00.242 --> 00:38:01.575
and some of their healing experience

944
00:38:01.575 --> 00:38:02.982
that's happened through this.

945
00:38:02.982 --> 00:38:04.647
<v BIlly>Oh, yeah.</v>
<v Woman>I love anecdotes.</v>

946
00:38:04.647 --> 00:38:06.192
<v Billy>I tell you, you know, I do too.</v>

947
00:38:06.192 --> 00:38:07.100
I love it.

948
00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.508
<v Woman>Just a couple, just share a couple.</v>

949
00:38:08.508 --> 00:38:09.830
'Cause I know we're almost out of time.

950
00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:12.635
<v ->Okay, yeah, wow, this has flown.</v>

951
00:38:12.635 --> 00:38:16.347
So, I tell you, I love that more than anything,

952
00:38:16.347 --> 00:38:17.332
getting

953
00:38:17.894 --> 00:38:19.259
just stories from people.

954
00:38:19.259 --> 00:38:22.789
How these formulas have just so dramatically

955
00:38:22.789 --> 00:38:26.533
impacted their health, you know, it's not just my own story.

956
00:38:26.533 --> 00:38:28.680
It's other people that say,

957
00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.118
"I started taking this every day,"

958
00:38:31.118 --> 00:38:35.299
and that, "I was suffering from this malady."

959
00:38:35.299 --> 00:38:38.041
I've heard amazing feedback from, actually,

960
00:38:38.041 --> 00:38:40.275
my vitamin C formula.

961
00:38:41.093 --> 00:38:43.535
More stories with the greens, but just recently,

962
00:38:43.535 --> 00:38:46.600
I've been hearing so many stories about the vitamin C.

963
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:50.195
And that, here's the thing, I really, really believe,

964
00:38:50.195 --> 00:38:53.913
if I had to, actually, if you don't mind,

965
00:38:53.913 --> 00:38:56.495
if I had to name a single most important nutrient,

966
00:38:56.495 --> 00:38:58.467
I would say it's vitamin C.

967
00:38:58.467 --> 00:38:59.438
<v Woman>I'm with you.</v>

968
00:38:59.438 --> 00:39:00.495
<v Billy>It's protection.</v>
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

969
00:39:00.495 --> 00:39:01.881
<v Billy>It's protection.</v>

970
00:39:01.881 --> 00:39:05.817
That okay, so (laughs)

971
00:39:05.817 --> 00:39:08.482
we named oxygen, that's way up there.

972
00:39:08.482 --> 00:39:11.630
And that vitamin C is too, because here's the thing.

973
00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:14.443
That vitamin C

974
00:39:14.443 --> 00:39:16.662
builds your immune system.

975
00:39:16.662 --> 00:39:21.354
And that, more than anything, we wanna revitalize

976
00:39:21.354 --> 00:39:23.477
and get more oxygen, but we also wanna

977
00:39:23.477 --> 00:39:27.072
just make that system protected and strong.

978
00:39:27.072 --> 00:39:30.356
And that we do get vitamin C from foods,

979
00:39:30.356 --> 00:39:35.263
but not like we do from super foods like camu camu,

980
00:39:35.263 --> 00:39:37.673
acerola berry, amla berry.

981
00:39:37.673 --> 00:39:41.886
That high vitamin C foods like strawberries and oranges

982
00:39:41.886 --> 00:39:45.054
and even broccoli are respectable.

983
00:39:45.054 --> 00:39:47.530
But to get to that level where we can really

984
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:51.347
just beat some maladies, where we can, like, kick butt

985
00:39:51.347 --> 00:39:55.378
with some bacteria and viral infections is like

986
00:39:55.378 --> 00:39:59.785
using these super food vitamin C ingredients.

987
00:39:59.785 --> 00:40:04.217
And that what I've found is that...

988
00:40:06.027 --> 00:40:08.103
I actually originally started working with

989
00:40:08.103 --> 00:40:09.671
just ascorbic acid.

990
00:40:09.671 --> 00:40:12.859
Like all the other vitamin C products,

991
00:40:12.859 --> 00:40:17.210
ascorbic acid, it's a synthetically produced vitamin C.

992
00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:20.486
Where, basically, okay, we look at the molecular structure

993
00:40:20.486 --> 00:40:22.865
of vitamin C in these foods, and then we replicate it

994
00:40:22.865 --> 00:40:26.513
using fermented corn products.

995
00:40:26.513 --> 00:40:29.050
And it does produce ascorbic acid.

996
00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:31.344
Now, ascorbic acid is actually only one

997
00:40:31.344 --> 00:40:33.860
of many vitamin C bioflavonoids.

998
00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:38.617
That we get many vitamin C bioflavonoids in foods.

999
00:40:38.617 --> 00:40:41.646
Ascorbic acid just being one of many, okay.

1000
00:40:41.646 --> 00:40:44.003
<v Woman>So you're essentially capturing all of them?</v>

1001
00:40:44.003 --> 00:40:44.653
<v ->Yes.</v>

1002
00:40:44.653 --> 00:40:45.975
<v Woman>With the vitamin C formula.</v>

1003
00:40:45.975 --> 00:40:48.941
<v ->Originally, I was interested in ascorbic acid,</v>

1004
00:40:48.941 --> 00:40:52.354
which is what all the vitamin C products are right now.

1005
00:40:52.354 --> 00:40:56.546
And that yes, it is vitamin C, but it's only one

1006
00:40:56.546 --> 00:40:59.064
of the vitamin C bioflavonoids.

1007
00:40:59.064 --> 00:41:02.496
And I would compare it to calling

1008
00:41:02.496 --> 00:41:05.699
just a slice of strawberry the whole strawberry.

1009
00:41:05.699 --> 00:41:08.505
Or calling an orange peel the whole orange.

1010
00:41:08.505 --> 00:41:10.083
Where it's all the other

1011
00:41:10.083 --> 00:41:12.707
vitamin C bioflavonoids in those foods.

1012
00:41:12.707 --> 00:41:15.917
It's the whole synergy, the whole vitamin C compund

1013
00:41:15.917 --> 00:41:18.744
that is really what just kicks stuff out.

1014
00:41:18.744 --> 00:41:22.274
That really, the chemistry of is that

1015
00:41:22.274 --> 00:41:24.632
these whole vitamin C foods,

1016
00:41:24.632 --> 00:41:26.989
like berries, like camu camu,

1017
00:41:26.989 --> 00:41:28.941
like these super foods that I've using,

1018
00:41:28.941 --> 00:41:31.458
it boosts your glycothymine levels.

1019
00:41:31.458 --> 00:41:32.962
Which is ingredient number one

1020
00:41:32.962 --> 00:41:35.788
for getting your immune system way, way up.

1021
00:41:35.788 --> 00:41:36.983
And so,

1022
00:41:36.983 --> 00:41:38.144
where was I going
<v Woman>Yeah, well,</v>

1023
00:41:38.144 --> 00:41:39.425
<v Billy>with all of this?</v>
<v Woman>I was asking you</v>

1024
00:41:39.425 --> 00:41:41.004
<v BIlly>I forget, okay.</v>
<v Woman>some of the</v>

1025
00:41:41.004 --> 00:41:42.592
anecdotes from this, and you're excited.

1026
00:41:42.592 --> 00:41:44.160
Because you're finding
<v Billy>Oh, yeah, yeah.</v>

1027
00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.653
<v Woman>that people are recently really responding</v>

1028
00:41:45.653 --> 00:41:47.584
to the vitamin C and not just the greens, and--

1029
00:41:47.584 --> 00:41:51.179
<v ->A customer I talked to this morning says,</v>

1030
00:41:51.179 --> 00:41:55.360
"So, a friend gave me the first bottle of your vitamin C.

1031
00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.761
I've been talking vitamin C products for many years."

1032
00:41:58.761 --> 00:42:02.175
You know, the vitamin C packets that you tear open

1033
00:42:02.175 --> 00:42:06.879
and they fizz up, and other ascorbic acid tablets.

1034
00:42:06.879 --> 00:42:09.297
And that when they have a cold,

1035
00:42:09.297 --> 00:42:11.047
they know that they take the vitamin C,

1036
00:42:11.047 --> 00:42:13.071
and they think that makes that a little shorter.

1037
00:42:13.071 --> 00:42:15.226
You know, the symptoms a little shorter.

1038
00:42:15.226 --> 00:42:17.700
And that what happened was, is they told me,

1039
00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:20.261
"Okay, I started feeling a sore throat.

1040
00:42:20.261 --> 00:42:22.479
"And I started taking your formula.

1041
00:42:22.479 --> 00:42:25.625
Bam, gone, it just kicked it right out."

1042
00:42:25.625 --> 00:42:28.965
And I said, "Yes, I love that."

1043
00:42:28.965 --> 00:42:32.651
That I really do genuinely believe that we can,

1044
00:42:32.651 --> 00:42:34.452
when it comes to our sore throats, and colds,

1045
00:42:34.452 --> 00:42:36.383
and things like that, that we can kick butt.

1046
00:42:36.383 --> 00:42:39.091
People just don't know that we have the tools

1047
00:42:39.091 --> 00:42:40.425
to really do it.

1048
00:42:40.425 --> 00:42:42.153
<v Woman>Absolutely, which is why I so badly</v>

1049
00:42:42.153 --> 00:42:43.720
wanted to talked to you on camera.

1050
00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.000
<v ->Yeah, yeah, so anyway,</v>

1051
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.643
I'm very excited about my vitamin C right now.

1052
00:42:46.643 --> 00:42:48.232
<v Woman>Yeah.</v>
<v Billy>Yeah. (laughs)</v>

1053
00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:49.158
<v Woman>Very good.</v>

1054
00:42:49.158 --> 00:42:52.860
Well, overall, because we are

1055
00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:54.778
about running out of time,

1056
00:42:57.126 --> 00:42:58.995
I find you very inspirational.

1057
00:42:58.995 --> 00:43:01.134
Because you're so passionate and pure

1058
00:43:01.134 --> 00:43:02.458
about what you're doing.
<v Billy>Thank you.</v>

1059
00:43:02.458 --> 00:43:03.695
<v Woman>Which is why</v>
<v Billy>Thank you.</v>

1060
00:43:03.695 --> 00:43:05.135
<v Woman>I wanted to talk to you.</v>

1061
00:43:05.135 --> 00:43:07.960
And I thank you for creating the kind of products

1062
00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.617
that you're creating, because we all need more of these.

1063
00:43:10.617 --> 00:43:13.177
I don't think there's a human being who can't benefit

1064
00:43:13.177 --> 00:43:15.716
from more of these super foods, as you're saying.

1065
00:43:15.716 --> 00:43:19.299
And on that note, is there any kind of final word

1066
00:43:19.299 --> 00:43:21.774
you'd like to share with us, regarding our health

1067
00:43:21.774 --> 00:43:23.619
and our responsibility for our health,

1068
00:43:23.619 --> 00:43:27.587
and the hope in being able to self-heal?

1069
00:43:27.587 --> 00:43:28.732
<v ->Yes.</v>

1070
00:43:29.538 --> 00:43:30.266
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

1071
00:43:30.266 --> 00:43:31.404
<v ->I'm not sure what that is.</v>

1072
00:43:31.404 --> 00:43:33.998
(both laugh)

1073
00:43:33.998 --> 00:43:36.013
I know I have something to say though.

1074
00:43:36.013 --> 00:43:37.497
<v Woman>Well, you're offering what you can</v>

1075
00:43:37.497 --> 00:43:38.690
in the physical world.

1076
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:40.259
You've shared your inspirational story,

1077
00:43:40.259 --> 00:43:41.880
your spirit speaking to you.

1078
00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.490
Anything else?

1079
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:46.512
<v ->Well, ultimately, you know,</v>

1080
00:43:46.512 --> 00:43:49.491
I have to hand all the spirit over to,

1081
00:43:50.286 --> 00:43:51.789
just, hi.

1082
00:43:51.789 --> 00:43:53.036
<v Woman>We have doggies here.</v>

1083
00:43:53.036 --> 00:43:53.750
<v ->Yes.</v>

1084
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:56.468
(BIlly laughs)

1085
00:43:57.079 --> 00:43:58.500
<v ->Yes, my furry friends here</v>

1086
00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:00.229
definitely get a lot of the credit.

1087
00:44:00.229 --> 00:44:03.148
And I have to hand all this,

1088
00:44:03.148 --> 00:44:07.919
all the credit over to the spirit, I really do.

1089
00:44:08.393 --> 00:44:11.450
That I met all the right people.

1090
00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:13.690
Had the right breaks.

1091
00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:16.697
And I know it's not chance, I know it's not coincidence.

1092
00:44:16.697 --> 00:44:20.677
That it was just spending hours of listening

1093
00:44:20.677 --> 00:44:22.468
and saying, "Okay, shepherd, show me.

1094
00:44:22.468 --> 00:44:24.506
"Holy spirit, what do I need to do?

1095
00:44:24.506 --> 00:44:26.330
"Do I need to go right here, do I need to go left?

1096
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:27.758
I'm listening."

1097
00:44:27.758 --> 00:44:31.453
And again, I didn't always get the answers, but that

1098
00:44:32.365 --> 00:44:34.551
Just incredible things would show up.

1099
00:44:34.551 --> 00:44:36.216
And ideas would show up.

1100
00:44:36.216 --> 00:44:39.608
And I got to work at the ashram full time for so many years.

1101
00:44:39.608 --> 00:44:42.573
And really just precision tune my formulas there.

1102
00:44:42.573 --> 00:44:45.538
Thank you so much to the people over at the ashrmam.

1103
00:44:45.538 --> 00:44:46.327
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

1104
00:44:46.327 --> 00:44:49.931
<v ->And it's also just exhilarating</v>

1105
00:44:49.931 --> 00:44:53.728
to sit here with you and reflect on these things.

1106
00:44:53.728 --> 00:44:57.568
And it just makes me incredibly happy

1107
00:44:57.568 --> 00:45:01.767
to just stop work.

1108
00:45:01.767 --> 00:45:02.983
(laughs)
<v Woman>Yeah.</v>

1109
00:45:02.983 --> 00:45:05.021
<v ->And just contemplate for a moment.</v>

1110
00:45:05.021 --> 00:45:06.833
And share with you--

1111
00:45:06.833 --> 00:45:07.933
<v Woman>Your own journey.</v>

1112
00:45:07.933 --> 00:45:09.372
<v ->Yeah, the whole story.</v>

1113
00:45:09.372 --> 00:45:11.174
And just contemplate the big picture.

1114
00:45:11.174 --> 00:45:15.660
And it just makes you really realize that we're...

1115
00:45:17.394 --> 00:45:18.738
We are blessed.

1116
00:45:18.738 --> 00:45:20.038
<v ->We are, indeed.</v>

1117
00:45:20.038 --> 00:45:21.894
Thank you so much for what you're offering.

1118
00:45:21.894 --> 00:45:24.593
And you have a long journey ahead, I'm sure.

1119
00:45:24.593 --> 00:45:27.376
And I'll be watching to see what you're developing

1120
00:45:27.376 --> 00:45:29.916
and working on as you go through your own journey.

1121
00:45:29.916 --> 00:45:31.665
(soothing music)

1122
00:45:31.665 --> 00:45:33.019
To connect with BIlly's greens,

1123
00:45:33.019 --> 00:45:35.526
you can go to InfinityGreens.com.

1124
00:45:35.526 --> 00:45:37.307
Meanwhile, I've been nudged in this direction

1125
00:45:37.307 --> 00:45:38.738
for more than a year now,

1126
00:45:38.738 --> 00:45:40.890
and have since made it a daily part of life.

1127
00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:42.978
And I'm experiencing heightened energy

1128
00:45:42.978 --> 00:45:44.290
and heightened awareness.

1129
00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:46.221
It may be different for you, but it can't hurt

1130
00:45:46.221 --> 00:45:49.026
to start getting more super green oxygen rich foods

1131
00:45:49.026 --> 00:45:50.828
wherever you can find them.

1132
00:45:50.828 --> 00:45:54.051
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
