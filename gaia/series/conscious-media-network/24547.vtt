00:00:00.674 --> 00:00:02.711
<v ->It's been a couple of years since our last interview</v>

2
00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:04.599
with Christine Arena, and she's finished her

3
00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:06.769
much-awaited book, The High Purpose Company.

4
00:00:07.244 --> 00:00:09.313
In her first book, Cause For Success,

5
00:00:09.313 --> 00:00:11.980
Christine reviewed companies that passed the litmus test

6
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.245
for their commitment for social responsibility.

7
00:00:14.763 --> 00:00:16.619
In her new book, she continues to look into

8
00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.944
the board rooms and bottom lines of companies

9
00:00:18.944 --> 00:00:20.896
for whom there is no turning back

10
00:00:20.896 --> 00:00:22.592
from the commitments they have made

11
00:00:22.592 --> 00:00:24.123
to leave the earth a better place.

12
00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:25.813
Some of them will surprise you.

13
00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:38.149
<v ->We're moving on from Cause for Success.</v>

14
00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:39.455
<v ->Yes.</v>

15
00:00:39.455 --> 00:00:41.010
<v ->This project has been,</v>

16
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.930
first of all, congratulations.

17
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.996
<v ->Thank you.</v>

18
00:00:43.996 --> 00:00:45.212
<v ->It's a wonderful book.</v>

19
00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:47.602
I'm anxious to share it with a number of people.

20
00:00:47.602 --> 00:00:50.663
What inspired you, from that point,

21
00:00:50.663 --> 00:00:52.012
to continue on into this?

22
00:00:52.012 --> 00:00:54.220
What was really the purpose of going further

23
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.756
into The High Purpose Company?

24
00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:59.841
<v ->I would say it was this surge in investment</v>

25
00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:02.251
that companies are making in, quote,

26
00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:04.758
"corporate responsibility," so every company

27
00:01:04.758 --> 00:01:07.670
that's featured in Cause For Success, my first book,

28
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.712
approached corporate responsibility in a strategic way.

29
00:01:11.712 --> 00:01:14.571
They ended up making a big difference for the planet

30
00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:15.978
and for their shareholders.

31
00:01:15.978 --> 00:01:18.069
In this next book, we looked at companies

32
00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:20.810
that were spending tens of millions of dollars

33
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.223
every year on advertising or public relations

34
00:01:24.223 --> 00:01:27.615
that tried to position them as a good citizen,

35
00:01:27.615 --> 00:01:30.100
as a company that cares about society,

36
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.191
that cares about the planet and the future

37
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:33.236
of the planet.

38
00:01:33.236 --> 00:01:35.721
What I did with the team of researchers,

39
00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:37.918
is we put their words to the test.

40
00:01:37.918 --> 00:01:41.129
This is a book that helps people

41
00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:43.934
to finally distinguish between true and false

42
00:01:43.934 --> 00:01:45.816
corporate responsibility.

43
00:01:46.238 --> 00:01:47.582
<v ->Yes, and an excellent job.</v>

44
00:01:47.582 --> 00:01:49.374
Toward the beginning of it,

45
00:01:49.374 --> 00:01:51.571
you have a little page there that pretty much

46
00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:53.097
gives you thumbs up, sideways,

47
00:01:53.097 --> 00:01:54.537
or a thumbs down so you can get

48
00:01:54.537 --> 00:01:57.022
a really quick sketch of some of the companies.

49
00:01:57.022 --> 00:01:59.529
As in your last book, some of it's really surprising.

50
00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:01.203
There are companies that get the thumbs up

51
00:02:01.203 --> 00:02:03.230
that no one would every guess.

52
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.201
<v ->That's right.</v>

53
00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:06.387
<v ->I really want to get into some of those specific stories</v>

54
00:02:06.387 --> 00:02:08.979
because I think we'll all find it quite interesting.

55
00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.867
One of the things you talk about in here

56
00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:13.928
is companies don't need to make the choice

57
00:02:13.928 --> 00:02:15.997
between doing well and doing good,

58
00:02:15.997 --> 00:02:17.640
and that is not a grammatical error,

59
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.717
for the record.

60
00:02:18.717 --> 00:02:19.528
<v ->Right.</v>

61
00:02:19.528 --> 00:02:20.520
<v ->Could you explain that?</v>

62
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.282
<v ->There is this outdated notion that in order to</v>

63
00:02:23.282 --> 00:02:24.978
make a difference in the world,

64
00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.186
you need to sacrifice profitability.

65
00:02:27.186 --> 00:02:30.087
We found that in some cases,

66
00:02:31.897 --> 00:02:34.191
when a company just throws money at a philanthropy

67
00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:37.433
but then continues to operate in a certain way

68
00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:39.631
that seems contrary to the position it's taking

69
00:02:39.631 --> 00:02:41.657
through that philanthropic association,

70
00:02:41.657 --> 00:02:43.790
they actually do lose money.

71
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.180
They actually don't benefit because society

72
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.387
doesn't buy what they're trying to sell,

73
00:02:48.387 --> 00:02:51.427
so a level of backlash is created against the company.

74
00:02:51.427 --> 00:02:53.038
The company then has to spin its wheels

75
00:02:53.038 --> 00:02:54.936
and spend more money on publicity,

76
00:02:54.936 --> 00:02:57.144
potentially legal, and all kinds of things

77
00:02:57.144 --> 00:02:59.043
that really don't work.

78
00:02:59.043 --> 00:03:01.187
Then there are companies, really smart companies

79
00:03:01.187 --> 00:03:05.427
like DuPont, GE, JetBlue,

80
00:03:05.427 --> 00:03:07.859
imperfect companies to be sure,

81
00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.739
but these companies are investing billions every year

82
00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.459
on environmental technologies, or on solutions

83
00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.008
to unmet world needs and problems

84
00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:18.493
ranging from water scarcity, which as you know,

85
00:03:18.493 --> 00:03:20.797
effects about a quarter of the planet's population,

86
00:03:20.797 --> 00:03:22.791
to global warming, which effects all of us,

87
00:03:22.791 --> 00:03:24.065
to poverty.

88
00:03:25.042 --> 00:03:28.828
Those companies have absolutely proven to Wall Street,

89
00:03:28.828 --> 00:03:33.660
not just the common man, that this really represents

90
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.585
what they're calling "late markets" or emerging markets,

91
00:03:37.585 --> 00:03:40.704
real strategic opportunities and growth opportunities.

92
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.662
The companies that are actually making

93
00:03:42.662 --> 00:03:45.478
the biggest difference and investing the most in this,

94
00:03:45.478 --> 00:03:47.729
are not the companies that people would think.

95
00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:48.912
It's not necessarily--

96
00:03:48.912 --> 00:03:51.280
<v ->You named a few of them and we're going to go into</v>

97
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.000
a couple of others because I love the stories behind them.

98
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.664
Would you say that, overall,

99
00:03:55.664 --> 00:03:58.800
as you journeyed through this project,

100
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.002
that this is going to become the defining factor,

101
00:04:03.002 --> 00:04:05.114
corporate responsibility is going to become

102
00:04:05.114 --> 00:04:06.767
the defining factor in the future

103
00:04:06.767 --> 00:04:09.434
because there is a significant enough shift

104
00:04:09.434 --> 00:04:11.343
in the consciousness of the consumer?

105
00:04:11.343 --> 00:04:12.708
Has that happened yet?

106
00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:15.268
<v ->We have absolutely reached a tipping point.</v>

107
00:04:15.268 --> 00:04:18.777
I think where we are is that companies are realizing

108
00:04:18.777 --> 00:04:21.604
that they need to redifine corporate responsibility

109
00:04:21.604 --> 00:04:24.718
because it's not so much about

110
00:04:24.718 --> 00:04:27.161
trying to be responsible in a typical sense,

111
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:30.542
it's about being responsive to the demands,

112
00:04:30.542 --> 00:04:32.472
as you're pointing out, of the public.

113
00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:35.843
We have access to information like you were just saying,

114
00:04:35.843 --> 00:04:39.533
like your network proves, that we did not have access to

115
00:04:39.533 --> 00:04:40.536
ten years ago.

116
00:04:40.536 --> 00:04:43.597
When something happens with Chevron in Nigeria,

117
00:04:43.597 --> 00:04:48.508
and something goes awry, we find out about it in real time.

118
00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:52.472
That's a totally different climate.

119
00:04:52.472 --> 00:04:54.733
That sets a completely different precedence

120
00:04:54.733 --> 00:04:55.918
than what we were dealing with ten years ago

121
00:04:55.918 --> 00:04:57.182
and fifteen years ago.

122
00:04:57.182 --> 00:05:00.574
If you couple that with the power of capitalism,

123
00:05:00.574 --> 00:05:02.686
moving all of these financial resources

124
00:05:02.686 --> 00:05:05.608
towards these fantastic sustainable solutions,

125
00:05:05.608 --> 00:05:08.392
and then you look at the customer support for all of this,

126
00:05:08.392 --> 00:05:10.344
and the consciousness, like you're saying,

127
00:05:10.344 --> 00:05:13.714
definitely there's a movement and it's not a trend.

128
00:05:13.714 --> 00:05:16.983
It is the way things are progressing and evolving.

129
00:05:17.586 --> 00:05:18.727
<v ->Which is good news.</v>

130
00:05:18.727 --> 00:05:19.580
<v ->I think so.</v>

131
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.927
<v ->Let's take one that was highly controversial.</v>

132
00:05:21.927 --> 00:05:24.786
A movie was made, in essence, about it

133
00:05:24.786 --> 00:05:26.364
that was quite popular.

134
00:05:26.364 --> 00:05:29.144
Leonardo Dicaprio, Blood Diamond, we're talking De Beers.

135
00:05:29.144 --> 00:05:32.286
Can you talk about what has happened with De Beers

136
00:05:32.286 --> 00:05:36.599
after having a very bloody, and certainly tainted, past?

137
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.171
<v ->De Beers does not pass my litmus test.</v>

138
00:05:39.171 --> 00:05:42.578
I would like to say that before I talk about De Beers.

139
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.950
This is such a good example.

140
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.462
As you know, the conflict in regions from which

141
00:05:50.462 --> 00:05:53.203
diamonds are sourced is so intense,

142
00:05:53.203 --> 00:05:55.528
and even with the Kimberley process,

143
00:05:55.528 --> 00:05:57.736
which De Beers has now signed onto,

144
00:05:57.736 --> 00:06:01.661
which is supposed to give some proof positive

145
00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:03.538
as to where those diamonds came from

146
00:06:03.538 --> 00:06:04.744
and how they were sourced,

147
00:06:04.744 --> 00:06:06.807
that's not even 100% foolproof.

148
00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.571
The fact is that De Beers realized,

149
00:06:09.571 --> 00:06:11.469
based on all kinds of things,

150
00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:13.869
based on its inability to compete in the United States

151
00:06:13.869 --> 00:06:16.791
for a while and operate retail in the United States

152
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:20.461
to all of the backlash it got in Europe, throughout Europe,

153
00:06:20.461 --> 00:06:22.115
throughout the world, really.

154
00:06:23.609 --> 00:06:26.404
People accused them of operating like a cartel.

155
00:06:26.404 --> 00:06:29.486
They realized that in order to continue to do business

156
00:06:29.486 --> 00:06:33.603
we have to face these issues just like R.J. Reynolds

157
00:06:33.603 --> 00:06:35.166
or Philip Morris.

158
00:06:35.166 --> 00:06:37.768
That is one class of company, and those companies

159
00:06:37.768 --> 00:06:39.998
are not the companies making the biggest difference.

160
00:06:39.998 --> 00:06:43.682
They're just being reactive, verses proactive.

161
00:06:44.142 --> 00:06:46.787
What I do in A High Purpose Company is highlight

162
00:06:46.787 --> 00:06:48.995
the companies that are being proactive about this

163
00:06:48.995 --> 00:06:50.787
because there's a big difference in terms of

164
00:06:50.787 --> 00:06:53.880
the difference that De Beers makes currently

165
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.501
compared to what it could make

166
00:06:55.501 --> 00:06:56.830
if it took a totally different approach.

167
00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.552
<v ->Even with a company and entity like De Beers,</v>

168
00:07:00.552 --> 00:07:03.134
they're being forced through consciousness,

169
00:07:03.134 --> 00:07:05.245
they're being forced through public awareness,

170
00:07:05.245 --> 00:07:07.453
to either lose their share entirely,

171
00:07:07.453 --> 00:07:10.322
have people boycott diamonds across the board,

172
00:07:10.322 --> 00:07:12.552
certainly in western countries,

173
00:07:12.552 --> 00:07:15.069
or have to shape up a bit.

174
00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:16.082
<v ->That's right.</v>

175
00:07:16.082 --> 00:07:18.482
<v ->Have they really made any significant progress?</v>

176
00:07:18.482 --> 00:07:20.220
<v ->They are making significant progress.</v>

177
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.564
You're describing a change or die theme.

178
00:07:25.564 --> 00:07:30.564
That is exactly what's going on in the corporate world.

179
00:07:30.855 --> 00:07:32.390
It's change or die.

180
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.502
You can see it in the automotive industry.

181
00:07:34.502 --> 00:07:36.379
Evolve your business model,

182
00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:39.025
evolve to more sustainable forms of transportation

183
00:07:39.025 --> 00:07:42.096
or die in the sense of losing market share

184
00:07:42.096 --> 00:07:44.949
to the companies that are, like Honda and Toyota.

185
00:07:45.456 --> 00:07:47.365
You can definitely see it the diamond,

186
00:07:47.365 --> 00:07:49.851
well, De Beers is a bizarre situation 'cause they own

187
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:51.722
like 90% of the diamond market.

188
00:07:52.144 --> 00:07:54.800
They basically are, but you can definitely see it

189
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.741
with companies in the coffee business,

190
00:07:56.741 --> 00:07:59.503
which is actually, that affects the lives

191
00:07:59.503 --> 00:08:01.786
of hundreds of millions of people,

192
00:08:01.786 --> 00:08:03.524
companies like Starbucks.

193
00:08:03.524 --> 00:08:05.892
There is this change or die theme.

194
00:08:05.892 --> 00:08:10.089
There is this theme that evolution is the way forward.

195
00:08:10.468 --> 00:08:13.945
I think innovation has now been applied

196
00:08:13.945 --> 00:08:16.174
to this space of corporate responsibility

197
00:08:16.174 --> 00:08:18.777
and I think that that is what everybody

198
00:08:18.777 --> 00:08:19.897
is talking about right now.

199
00:08:19.897 --> 00:08:21.369
I think that that's what will lead trends

200
00:08:21.369 --> 00:08:22.777
over the next decade.

201
00:08:22.777 --> 00:08:24.377
<v ->Let's talk more about change or die.</v>

202
00:08:24.377 --> 00:08:25.849
American Airlines.

203
00:08:25.849 --> 00:08:28.675
<v ->Again, you're pointing out a company</v>

204
00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:32.067
that has yet to catch up with what I would consider

205
00:08:32.067 --> 00:08:34.802
a really great example.

206
00:08:36.745 --> 00:08:38.441
<v ->Are JetBlue and Southwest pretty much</v>

207
00:08:38.441 --> 00:08:39.692
toward the leading edge of that?

208
00:08:39.692 --> 00:08:41.399
<v ->Oh yeah, definitely, Southwest is fabulous.</v>

209
00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:42.850
<v ->Let's take the big, lumbering American</v>

210
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.247
and then we'll go into the difference

211
00:08:44.247 --> 00:08:46.033
and we'll reflect that against Southwest.

212
00:08:47.053 --> 00:08:50.647
<v ->American Airlines, the airlines are just notorious</v>

213
00:08:50.647 --> 00:08:53.153
for offering people terrible service.

214
00:08:54.043 --> 00:08:58.379
They have always had this very pithy relationship

215
00:08:58.379 --> 00:09:00.131
with their own employees.

216
00:09:00.131 --> 00:09:02.317
It's always been this battle between the unions

217
00:09:02.317 --> 00:09:04.035
and their management at the airlines,

218
00:09:04.035 --> 00:09:06.402
and there was always a lack of communication

219
00:09:06.402 --> 00:09:07.800
or breakdown.

220
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.925
That has been historic problem for the entire category.

221
00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:13.880
American Airlines realized that, and so they

222
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.371
started listening to their people for a change.

223
00:09:16.371 --> 00:09:19.048
They started asking people, reaching out

224
00:09:19.048 --> 00:09:20.371
to their employees and saying,

225
00:09:20.371 --> 00:09:23.571
"We're in trouble, financially, and we don't want to ask you

226
00:09:23.571 --> 00:09:25.619
"to take another pay cut, so what we're gonna ask you

227
00:09:25.619 --> 00:09:28.936
"to do is come to us with good ideas

228
00:09:28.936 --> 00:09:31.880
"of how we can save money, how we can be

229
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.674
"a more effective airline, and we will reward you

230
00:09:34.674 --> 00:09:36.946
"based on those contributions."

231
00:09:36.946 --> 00:09:38.759
<v ->I know some of the specifics in that.</v>

232
00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:40.818
Some of the stories you tell that the workers

233
00:09:40.818 --> 00:09:43.474
are really quite creative when put to a task.

234
00:09:43.474 --> 00:09:45.511
After they put it out there, they came up with

235
00:09:45.511 --> 00:09:48.039
some ingenius solutions that would, literally,

236
00:09:48.039 --> 00:09:50.183
save millions of dollars a year for the airline.

237
00:09:50.183 --> 00:09:51.686
Can you talk about a couple of them?

238
00:09:51.686 --> 00:09:53.852
<v ->One will talk about the psychology behind that.</v>

239
00:09:53.852 --> 00:09:56.497
What they're doing is they're empowering people

240
00:09:56.497 --> 00:09:58.470
to be a part of the change verses just

241
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.766
working and being treated as a cog on a wheel,

242
00:10:01.766 --> 00:10:03.046
which people don't like.

243
00:10:03.046 --> 00:10:04.315
Human beings don't like that.

244
00:10:04.315 --> 00:10:06.363
They're not creative under those circumstances,

245
00:10:06.363 --> 00:10:09.477
and that effects a business, a business's ability

246
00:10:09.477 --> 00:10:11.099
to compete, even.

247
00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:15.929
One of the ideas came from one of the mechanics

248
00:10:15.929 --> 00:10:18.371
that works on the plane as the plane pulls in,

249
00:10:18.371 --> 00:10:20.568
and they've got to service things before the plane

250
00:10:20.568 --> 00:10:23.150
takes off five minutes later to go back across the country

251
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:24.547
because, of course, they never give these planes

252
00:10:24.547 --> 00:10:27.960
any rest, the planes don't have unions.

253
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.149
He decided, instead of throwing all of these

254
00:10:31.149 --> 00:10:34.498
drill bits away, what if we came up with a better drill bit

255
00:10:34.498 --> 00:10:36.653
that, and this sounds like a random example,

256
00:10:36.653 --> 00:10:39.415
but that lasted longer and that was much more effective,

257
00:10:39.415 --> 00:10:41.559
and what if we replaced this part with this part?

258
00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:43.276
That little thing, and then he came up with,

259
00:10:43.276 --> 00:10:46.060
he rigged this machine to be able to change those

260
00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:49.911
drill bits on a more rapid pace.

261
00:10:49.911 --> 00:10:51.351
That saved the company, I think,

262
00:10:51.351 --> 00:10:53.772
about a quarter of a million dollars in the first year.

263
00:10:53.772 --> 00:10:55.329
It was a great idea.

264
00:10:55.329 --> 00:10:56.769
The guy's a union guy.

265
00:10:56.769 --> 00:10:59.947
He's never been treated nicely by anyone at the company,

266
00:10:59.947 --> 00:11:01.590
probably, and now this is the first time

267
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.222
people are listening to him and going,

268
00:11:03.222 --> 00:11:04.470
"Hey, that's a great idea."

269
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.232
Then, the press picks it up so he gets publicity

270
00:11:07.232 --> 00:11:09.178
and it's a fantastic thing for him.

271
00:11:09.585 --> 00:11:11.440
All kinds of people in American Airlines

272
00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.446
started to do the same thing, and that really, again,

273
00:11:13.446 --> 00:11:15.920
changed the psychology of the company,

274
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.925
of the relationship the company had with its employees,

275
00:11:17.925 --> 00:11:21.029
which then affected the customer experience

276
00:11:21.029 --> 00:11:23.258
because, of course, you've been on a flight

277
00:11:23.258 --> 00:11:27.205
where people are very upset and hostile,

278
00:11:27.205 --> 00:11:29.210
and that's probably because...

279
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.439
<v ->Because sometimes they're surly with you.</v>

280
00:11:31.439 --> 00:11:35.657
<v ->Right, and sometimes that tone is set from the top.</v>

281
00:11:36.218 --> 00:11:37.263
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

282
00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:40.004
What has the net affect been on American Airlines?

283
00:11:40.504 --> 00:11:45.459
<v ->So far, it has been morale has increased.</v>

284
00:11:45.619 --> 00:11:47.955
They've had some financial savings,

285
00:11:47.955 --> 00:11:52.394
but that morale, for a company that is on the brink,

286
00:11:52.394 --> 00:11:56.116
was on the brink of bankruptcy, is really important.

287
00:11:56.116 --> 00:11:57.364
<v ->Right.</v>

288
00:11:59.704 --> 00:12:02.782
<v ->My book shows this ladder</v>

289
00:12:02.782 --> 00:12:04.596
of corporate responsibility effectiveness.

290
00:12:04.596 --> 00:12:06.868
The higher companies climb the ladder,

291
00:12:06.868 --> 00:12:08.382
the more of a difference they make,

292
00:12:08.382 --> 00:12:12.840
the more the net impact of their particular strategy,

293
00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.155
so the bigger the results, the rewards,

294
00:12:15.155 --> 00:12:17.160
financially, socially, and environmentally.

295
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.411
The companies in the beginning initial rungs

296
00:12:19.411 --> 00:12:22.947
make a nice impact, but it's not life-changing.

297
00:12:22.947 --> 00:12:24.269
<v ->But you have to start somewhere,</v>

298
00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:25.474
and we're talking about some companies

299
00:12:25.474 --> 00:12:28.376
that are struggling along, it's change or die,

300
00:12:28.376 --> 00:12:29.794
and they're starting somewhere,

301
00:12:29.794 --> 00:12:31.906
and just taking a little look at where they're starting.

302
00:12:31.906 --> 00:12:34.978
Let's take an airline that, for example, is known to be

303
00:12:34.978 --> 00:12:39.202
more proactive, I would think, is Southwest Airlines.

304
00:12:39.202 --> 00:12:43.148
How do you compare the two

305
00:12:43.148 --> 00:12:45.815
in terms of their corporate responsibility

306
00:12:45.815 --> 00:12:47.884
and why you would place one above the other

307
00:12:47.884 --> 00:12:49.644
in terms of high purpose?

308
00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:53.387
<v ->Southwest and JetBlue, I put in the same class</v>

309
00:12:53.387 --> 00:12:57.050
in the sense that they are both purpose-driven companies.

310
00:12:58.912 --> 00:13:01.963
For Southwest, it is all about improving

311
00:13:01.963 --> 00:13:05.931
people's experience, and JetBlue has a slant on that,

312
00:13:05.931 --> 00:13:08.117
and they say their higher purpose is to bring humanity

313
00:13:08.117 --> 00:13:11.413
back to air travel, which is so relevant right now.

314
00:13:11.413 --> 00:13:14.293
Of course, we all know what happened with JetBlue,

315
00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:16.426
which I think is a really interesting story,

316
00:13:16.426 --> 00:13:20.394
a couple of months ago with the stranded passengers

317
00:13:20.394 --> 00:13:22.186
on the tarmac for ten hours.

318
00:13:22.186 --> 00:13:25.972
What was interesting to me, more than that event,

319
00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:27.316
'cause I was one of the stranded passengers,

320
00:13:27.316 --> 00:13:30.004
not on the tarmac, but I was trying to get to JFK,

321
00:13:30.004 --> 00:13:32.916
was, of course there was a whole meltdown

322
00:13:32.916 --> 00:13:35.209
in telecommunications, of course there were

323
00:13:35.209 --> 00:13:37.118
thousands of stranded passengers.

324
00:13:37.118 --> 00:13:39.033
I was fascinated by the way the press

325
00:13:39.033 --> 00:13:42.190
covered that meltdown because what they were doing

326
00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:45.507
was they were showing, they were trying to

327
00:13:45.507 --> 00:13:49.667
knock JetBlue out of its territory as being

328
00:13:49.667 --> 00:13:51.288
a service-driven airline.

329
00:13:51.288 --> 00:13:53.677
If this had happened to Southwest, I can guarantee

330
00:13:53.677 --> 00:13:56.930
that the press probably, and competitive airlines

331
00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:59.223
probably would have wanted to do the same thing.

332
00:13:59.223 --> 00:14:00.994
The press was covering the meltdown,

333
00:14:00.994 --> 00:14:02.828
and then they went right to people like Ralph Nader

334
00:14:02.828 --> 00:14:06.935
talking about the need for congressional push

335
00:14:06.935 --> 00:14:08.844
for a passenger Bill of Rights.

336
00:14:08.844 --> 00:14:13.206
What they didn't cover was Dave Neeleman's response,

337
00:14:13.206 --> 00:14:15.617
the CEO of JetBlue's response to the people

338
00:14:15.617 --> 00:14:17.302
who were stranded, the airline's response

339
00:14:17.302 --> 00:14:20.161
to those stranded passengers, and the airline's decision

340
00:14:20.161 --> 00:14:23.040
to proactively institute a Bill of Rights,

341
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.283
which, by the way, other airlines were not happy about

342
00:14:26.283 --> 00:14:29.931
because that's akin to GM fighting forward

343
00:14:29.931 --> 00:14:32.416
and saying, "Ford, don't put seatbelts in your cars,"

344
00:14:32.416 --> 00:14:35.946
in 1972 because that'll make us put, same thing.

345
00:14:35.946 --> 00:14:38.431
This was an unpopular thing, but they did that,

346
00:14:38.431 --> 00:14:40.842
and they are making these major operational changes

347
00:14:40.842 --> 00:14:42.751
based on the meltdown.

348
00:14:42.751 --> 00:14:45.770
With an airline like Southwest or JetBlue,

349
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:49.417
both airlines constantly listen to their people.

350
00:14:49.417 --> 00:14:53.588
They're not arrogant. They apologize when things go wrong.

351
00:14:53.588 --> 00:14:57.976
They proactively institute better policies.

352
00:14:58.238 --> 00:15:01.989
They do not claim to be perfect, and that's what they

353
00:15:01.989 --> 00:15:03.503
have in common.
<v ->But they are humane.</v>

354
00:15:03.503 --> 00:15:06.010
<v ->That's exactly right, that is humane.</v>

355
00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:09.028
<v ->It is humanity that is making the difference</v>

356
00:15:09.028 --> 00:15:11.924
rather than the perception of humanity.

357
00:15:12.053 --> 00:15:13.173
<v ->Exactly.</v>

358
00:15:13.173 --> 00:15:14.751
<v ->Before we go into any other companies</v>

359
00:15:14.751 --> 00:15:17.505
and some of the really fabulous high purpose companies

360
00:15:17.505 --> 00:15:21.334
that you profiled here, let's talk about the perception

361
00:15:21.334 --> 00:15:23.702
of corporate responsibility.

362
00:15:25.422 --> 00:15:27.563
In fact, a few examples would be good,

363
00:15:27.563 --> 00:15:31.936
verses real corporate responsibility because that's,

364
00:15:31.936 --> 00:15:34.741
in a certain way, almost sociopathic

365
00:15:34.741 --> 00:15:37.344
to represent your company in such a way

366
00:15:37.344 --> 00:15:41.962
and then, essentially, operate in opposition to that,

367
00:15:41.962 --> 00:15:44.682
but this happens all the time for the spin.

368
00:15:44.682 --> 00:15:45.930
<v ->It happens all the time.</v>

369
00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.447
In fact, the companies and industries

370
00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:51.786
that spend the most money on corporate responsibility

371
00:15:51.786 --> 00:15:56.340
related advertising or PR are the most contentious.

372
00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.196
They are the pharmaceutical companies,

373
00:15:58.196 --> 00:15:59.753
they are the oil companies.

374
00:15:59.753 --> 00:16:03.422
They're the companies whose profits and interests

375
00:16:03.422 --> 00:16:06.601
lie here, and their messages, in many cases

376
00:16:06.601 --> 00:16:10.131
but not all, but definitely in many cases, lie here.

377
00:16:10.131 --> 00:16:11.635
Let me tell you something.

378
00:16:11.635 --> 00:16:15.102
What's in this book is probably, especially in Chapter 2,

379
00:16:15.102 --> 00:16:18.088
when I outline the companies where there's a huge gap

380
00:16:18.088 --> 00:16:19.667
between what they say and what they do,

381
00:16:19.667 --> 00:16:24.040
I couldn't print the bulk of the interviews I actually did

382
00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.589
because what we wanted to do in this study

383
00:16:26.589 --> 00:16:28.498
was really get to the bottom of,

384
00:16:28.498 --> 00:16:32.658
is a company like Merck, that says it puts patients first,

385
00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:35.047
and isn't that interesting that it launched that

386
00:16:35.047 --> 00:16:37.736
$40 million campaign on top of the Vioxx scandal?

387
00:16:37.736 --> 00:16:40.648
Is it really putting patients first?

388
00:16:40.648 --> 00:16:42.963
We talked to whistleblowers inside the FDA,

389
00:16:42.963 --> 00:16:46.994
we talked to doctors who were hired to promote Vioxx,

390
00:16:46.994 --> 00:16:50.653
tons of that testimony, as well as the testimony we got

391
00:16:51.043 --> 00:16:55.920
on behalf of plaintiffs, we spoke to plaintiff attorneys

392
00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.098
who were involved in litigation against oil companies

393
00:16:59.098 --> 00:17:00.954
and so forth, and whistleblowers.

394
00:17:00.954 --> 00:17:04.282
We couldn't print a lot of that for reasons of libel.

395
00:17:05.772 --> 00:17:07.035
<v ->I understand.</v>

396
00:17:07.035 --> 00:17:10.373
<v ->Even if what someone is telling you is the truth,</v>

397
00:17:10.373 --> 00:17:11.297
in some forms of media--

398
00:17:11.297 --> 00:17:12.683
<v ->Doesn't mean you can put it out there.</v>

399
00:17:12.683 --> 00:17:14.059
<v ->You can't print it.</v>

400
00:17:14.059 --> 00:17:17.355
What I'm trying to say here is that the discrepancies

401
00:17:17.355 --> 00:17:19.563
in some companies between what they say,

402
00:17:19.563 --> 00:17:21.515
what they spend millions of dollars saying,

403
00:17:21.515 --> 00:17:25.067
and what they do, is so vast that it's almost ridiculous.

404
00:17:25.067 --> 00:17:29.930
For a company whose profits, growth,

405
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:34.549
and competitive edge rely on petroleum resources,

406
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:39.103
to say that it is

407
00:17:39.103 --> 00:17:42.815
all about renewable energy and the future,

408
00:17:42.815 --> 00:17:45.897
when it is spending the bulk of its research and development

409
00:17:45.897 --> 00:17:50.897
dollars, 99.8% of that money on

410
00:17:52.469 --> 00:17:57.343
trying to untap new sources of oil, that's completely,

411
00:17:57.343 --> 00:18:01.300
it looks like pure marketing cover, and maybe it is,

412
00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.201
it probably is, certainly to the stakeholders we talked to,

413
00:18:04.201 --> 00:18:07.444
and again, we interviewed hundreds of people for this book.

414
00:18:07.444 --> 00:18:09.865
They certainly indicated that they felt that way.

415
00:18:09.865 --> 00:18:12.692
<v ->I think that you are savvy enough to know</v>

416
00:18:12.692 --> 00:18:14.857
that when you see the fairy dust and daisies,

417
00:18:14.857 --> 00:18:16.713
that's not all there is to the story.

418
00:18:16.713 --> 00:18:17.801
<v ->That's right.</v>

419
00:18:17.801 --> 00:18:20.403
<v ->For example, big pharmaceutical industry,</v>

420
00:18:20.403 --> 00:18:23.560
but you're talking about a very close relationship

421
00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.928
between the skin of the advertisement

422
00:18:25.928 --> 00:18:29.224
and the survival of America, in particular,

423
00:18:29.224 --> 00:18:32.040
but also other countries, of the media.

424
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.941
<v ->Oh, yeah, exactly.</v>

425
00:18:36.521 --> 00:18:39.954
<v ->This is a dance. That's why we hear so much.</v>

426
00:18:39.954 --> 00:18:43.186
That's why we see the little fairy dust sprinkled

427
00:18:43.186 --> 00:18:45.202
over the woman as she's falling asleep to this

428
00:18:45.202 --> 00:18:48.060
particular drug after she's--

429
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.169
<v ->Right.</v>

430
00:18:49.169 --> 00:18:52.326
<v ->That really is the crux of the problem</v>

431
00:18:52.326 --> 00:18:54.609
because you're not seeing Patagonia.

432
00:18:54.609 --> 00:18:56.599
There are a few of them in here,

433
00:18:56.599 --> 00:18:58.454
but most of the companies that are really working

434
00:18:58.454 --> 00:19:01.100
with purpose, you're not going to see them reflected

435
00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.817
in the media.

436
00:19:02.817 --> 00:19:06.390
<v ->No, because they don't need to, because they're authentic.</v>

437
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:09.803
They don't need to fabricate some elaborate story.

438
00:19:09.803 --> 00:19:11.104
Let me tell you something.

439
00:19:11.104 --> 00:19:15.680
If you go to monsanto.com, and you read the language

440
00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.581
they use to describe corporate responsibility,

441
00:19:18.581 --> 00:19:23.018
Monsanto says, "When you look at Monsanto,

442
00:19:23.018 --> 00:19:26.431
"what you see is a socially responsible company."

443
00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:28.341
That's a direct quote.

444
00:19:28.341 --> 00:19:30.373
Can you imagine me sitting here and saying,

445
00:19:30.373 --> 00:19:34.021
"When you look at me, you're gonna see a smart,

446
00:19:34.021 --> 00:19:36.645
"et cetera, et cetera," how arrogant.

447
00:19:36.645 --> 00:19:38.565
<v ->Fabulous, award-winning author.</v>

448
00:19:38.565 --> 00:19:41.125
<v ->Smart people don't have to tell us they're smart,</v>

449
00:19:41.125 --> 00:19:43.194
cool people don't have to tell us they're cool.

450
00:19:43.194 --> 00:19:46.703
Good companies shouldn't have to tell us

451
00:19:46.703 --> 00:19:49.721
that they're good, and they also should definitely

452
00:19:49.721 --> 00:19:52.367
not say, "When you see me, you see good,"

453
00:19:52.367 --> 00:19:55.684
because of course that's a clue into their darker side,

454
00:19:55.684 --> 00:19:58.073
and people get that.

455
00:19:58.073 --> 00:19:59.907
<v ->The entanglement between the media,</v>

456
00:19:59.907 --> 00:20:02.158
in fact, most of the news programs

457
00:20:02.158 --> 00:20:04.835
are supported by these very entities you're talking about.

458
00:20:04.835 --> 00:20:05.646
<v ->Yes.</v>

459
00:20:05.646 --> 00:20:07.971
<v ->Now you're aligning, quote, "The news of the day,"</v>

460
00:20:07.971 --> 00:20:11.469
the, quote, "credibility" of the news organization

461
00:20:11.469 --> 00:20:14.765
with slippery tales from these companies.

462
00:20:14.765 --> 00:20:16.696
<v ->These are also the biggest lobbies.</v>

463
00:20:16.696 --> 00:20:18.072
<v ->And the biggest lobbies.</v>

464
00:20:18.072 --> 00:20:20.578
That is one of the problems we have as a culture,

465
00:20:20.578 --> 00:20:22.829
and why we buy so much into it,

466
00:20:22.829 --> 00:20:24.898
but now, as you say, when you start looking

467
00:20:24.898 --> 00:20:27.010
at the other side, if you start looking

468
00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:29.303
at the lighter side, there are some other players

469
00:20:29.303 --> 00:20:31.393
who are making in roads, even in a big way.

470
00:20:31.393 --> 00:20:32.791
Let's talk Toyota.

471
00:20:32.791 --> 00:20:35.340
<v ->Sure. Toyota's not perfect.</v>

472
00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.196
A lot of people get angry when I go

473
00:20:37.196 --> 00:20:39.542
and I talk about Toyota's investments.

474
00:20:39.542 --> 00:20:42.070
Toyota has said, and I want to talk about

475
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.862
the Law of Attraction, because this is related

476
00:20:43.862 --> 00:20:45.931
to what Toyota is doing.

477
00:20:45.931 --> 00:20:48.971
Toyota said, "Our purpose is to make

478
00:20:48.971 --> 00:20:52.757
"sustainable mobility a reality, so we intend to make

479
00:20:52.757 --> 00:20:55.381
"the internal combustion engine obsolete."

480
00:20:55.381 --> 00:20:57.770
Using the company's greatest strengths,

481
00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:01.024
drawing upon the enormous intellect at Toyota,

482
00:21:01.024 --> 00:21:03.647
and by enabling creativity, and by saying

483
00:21:03.647 --> 00:21:06.218
change is the way forward, innovation is the way forward,

484
00:21:06.218 --> 00:21:08.506
they manifest that reality.

485
00:21:08.506 --> 00:21:12.184
They are not 100% driven by their

486
00:21:13.473 --> 00:21:16.791
investments in fuel cell, or hybrid vehicles,

487
00:21:16.791 --> 00:21:18.274
or electric vehicles.

488
00:21:18.274 --> 00:21:20.556
The Who Killed the Electric Car thing is really interesting.

489
00:21:20.556 --> 00:21:22.615
<v ->That's a very interesting documentary.</v>

490
00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:27.020
<v ->Certainly, they've put a huge stake in the ground.</v>

491
00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:30.124
Here's the thing, the stake in the ground

492
00:21:30.124 --> 00:21:33.281
can't be removed now because it's so profitable

493
00:21:33.281 --> 00:21:34.795
to the company.

494
00:21:34.795 --> 00:21:38.027
Toyota's benefiting to such a degree through its

495
00:21:38.027 --> 00:21:41.878
investments in environmentally sound technologies

496
00:21:41.878 --> 00:21:44.107
that it can't afford to stop investing.

497
00:21:44.107 --> 00:21:47.104
That's what the companies that pass my litmus test do.

498
00:21:48.324 --> 00:21:51.285
They could not survive without their higher purpose,

499
00:21:51.285 --> 00:21:53.717
just like society would be worse off without them.

500
00:21:53.717 --> 00:21:56.501
That is a very different look at corporate responsibility

501
00:21:56.501 --> 00:21:57.621
because I'm not saying,

502
00:21:57.621 --> 00:21:59.477
"Which companies are the best citizens?

503
00:21:59.477 --> 00:22:02.474
"Which companies are the perfect good ones?"

504
00:22:02.474 --> 00:22:05.844
I'm saying, "Which ones are making such significant

505
00:22:05.844 --> 00:22:08.351
"investments that they're making such a difference

506
00:22:08.351 --> 00:22:10.623
"to their shareholders that they can't stop?"

507
00:22:10.623 --> 00:22:12.457
It's forced evolution.

508
00:22:12.457 --> 00:22:14.388
<v ->By upholding their corporate responsibility.</v>

509
00:22:14.388 --> 00:22:15.262
<v ->That's right.</v>

510
00:22:15.262 --> 00:22:17.449
They've passed a point of no return.

511
00:22:17.449 --> 00:22:20.228
<v ->Right, and that's interesting.</v>

512
00:22:20.228 --> 00:22:22.820
Some of the people that, let's talk about some companies

513
00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:25.401
that started out with that heart and soul intact

514
00:22:25.401 --> 00:22:27.865
to begin with, and managed to make it, sometimes,

515
00:22:27.865 --> 00:22:29.390
even against the odds.

516
00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.369
<v ->Patagonia is a great example of a company</v>

517
00:22:33.369 --> 00:22:35.438
that was founded.

518
00:22:35.438 --> 00:22:38.968
Patagonia's customer is an outdoor enthusiast,

519
00:22:38.968 --> 00:22:42.191
is someone who engages with the environment

520
00:22:42.191 --> 00:22:44.696
in a very real way, almost everyday.

521
00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:47.044
It's so passionate about that, so they were

522
00:22:47.044 --> 00:22:50.371
founded with that vision, and they stayed with it,

523
00:22:50.371 --> 00:22:52.569
even during the times where the company

524
00:22:52.569 --> 00:22:54.749
had difficulty, financially.

525
00:22:55.092 --> 00:22:56.627
They would never give that up because that's

526
00:22:56.627 --> 00:22:59.881
core to who they are, and that's why they're successful.

527
00:22:59.881 --> 00:23:03.080
Frankly, Patagonia, in the interviews I've had with them,

528
00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.950
this is so fascinating, this psychology,

529
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:10.355
they refused to describe themselves as being

530
00:23:11.915 --> 00:23:16.621
environmentally responsible, which is so interesting.

531
00:23:17.611 --> 00:23:18.403
<v ->But it makes sense.</v>

532
00:23:18.403 --> 00:23:20.216
When I was reading that portion of the book,

533
00:23:20.216 --> 00:23:21.912
they know that there are things they still

534
00:23:21.912 --> 00:23:23.000
could be doing better.

535
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:23.906
<v ->That's right.</v>

536
00:23:23.906 --> 00:23:25.879
It's the whole notion of when you really understand

537
00:23:25.879 --> 00:23:28.855
the magnitude of the environmental problems we face,

538
00:23:28.855 --> 00:23:30.476
then you know that any small solution,

539
00:23:30.476 --> 00:23:33.064
whether it's making a fleece from soda bottles,

540
00:23:33.064 --> 00:23:37.100
or using more organic cotton, is not enough.

541
00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.869
Good enough never is, and it's sort of

542
00:23:39.869 --> 00:23:44.818
this ongoing creative discontent,

543
00:23:44.818 --> 00:23:47.111
and that drives these companies forward.

544
00:23:47.111 --> 00:23:48.860
It's a fascinating psychology.

545
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.642
Again, looking at the language of a company

546
00:23:50.642 --> 00:23:52.412
from Patagonia to say,

547
00:23:52.412 --> 00:23:54.221
"We're not arrogant enough to call ourselves

548
00:23:54.221 --> 00:23:55.629
"an environmental leader."

549
00:23:55.629 --> 00:23:57.100
That's actually what they say.

550
00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.927
"We don't consider ourselves an environmental leader."

551
00:23:59.927 --> 00:24:02.572
But Exxon calls itself an environmental leader,

552
00:24:02.572 --> 00:24:04.343
and it's advertising saying,

553
00:24:04.343 --> 00:24:07.030
"We are the one company doing X, Y, and Z."

554
00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.254
<v Interviewer>Ironic.</v>
<v ->Totally different.</v>

555
00:24:10.262 --> 00:24:12.043
<v ->What about SC Johnson &amp; Son?</v>

556
00:24:12.043 --> 00:24:13.223
That's kind of interesting.

557
00:24:13.223 --> 00:24:14.206
<v ->I love that company.</v>

558
00:24:14.206 --> 00:24:16.627
That is a company that I love and it's because

559
00:24:16.627 --> 00:24:19.293
nobody would think of SC Johnson Company,

560
00:24:19.293 --> 00:24:24.050
with products like Shout, Windex,

561
00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:26.893
that's right, Windex, Raid.

562
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.736
<v ->I wouldn't have looked there.</v>

563
00:24:31.446 --> 00:24:34.189
<v ->What they do is instead of just marketing,</v>

564
00:24:34.189 --> 00:24:37.399
they don't just put a green label on their products.

565
00:24:37.399 --> 00:24:38.861
What they do is they figure out,

566
00:24:38.861 --> 00:24:41.602
what chemicals are we using?

567
00:24:41.602 --> 00:24:44.780
They align with Environmental Protection Agency and say,

568
00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:48.375
"We're gonna come up with a process called green list,

569
00:24:48.375 --> 00:24:51.585
"and that is all about looking at the nature

570
00:24:51.585 --> 00:24:53.537
"of what we're putting into our products

571
00:24:53.537 --> 00:24:57.430
"and making sure that we use as many non-toxic

572
00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.707
"materials, ingredients, as possible,

573
00:25:01.707 --> 00:25:03.776
"and we're going to come up with a rating system,

574
00:25:03.776 --> 00:25:06.773
"and our goal is to get to the highest level

575
00:25:06.773 --> 00:25:09.557
"of environmental integrity," and they're doing it.

576
00:25:09.557 --> 00:25:13.429
They're being tremendously successful by doing that,

577
00:25:13.429 --> 00:25:16.032
and nobody would know that in Windex, actually,

578
00:25:16.032 --> 00:25:19.071
there are a lot of merits to this company's products,

579
00:25:19.071 --> 00:25:22.063
and it's really on this curve where, again,

580
00:25:22.063 --> 00:25:24.570
because of the investments it has made

581
00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:27.678
in what goes on behind the scenes, it can't stop.

582
00:25:28.218 --> 00:25:30.302
It's definitely past the point of no return.

583
00:25:30.724 --> 00:25:33.700
In fact, SC Johnson doesn't even consider that

584
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.993
social responsibility, they just think it's the way

585
00:25:35.993 --> 00:25:38.532
they were, which is actually a great thing.

586
00:25:38.532 --> 00:25:39.460
<v ->It is.</v>

587
00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:43.720
Why is it that people don't really know this story, though?

588
00:25:43.918 --> 00:25:45.283
<v ->They haven't told it.</v>

589
00:25:45.283 --> 00:25:48.579
So many companies are so focused on doing better

590
00:25:48.579 --> 00:25:50.413
that they forget to tell their story.

591
00:25:50.413 --> 00:25:51.341
<v ->That's refreshing.</v>

592
00:25:51.341 --> 00:25:53.389
<v ->Patagonia has had the same problem,</v>

593
00:25:53.389 --> 00:25:57.213
where consumers were thinking that REI,

594
00:25:57.213 --> 00:25:59.400
one of their competitors, was a little bit more

595
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.021
environmentally responsible.

596
00:26:01.021 --> 00:26:03.901
Patagonia was like, "Whoa, we do way more than REI."

597
00:26:03.901 --> 00:26:05.991
REI is doing some great things but they're saying,

598
00:26:05.991 --> 00:26:07.965
"Wait a minute," and it was because they don't

599
00:26:07.965 --> 00:26:08.935
talk about it.

600
00:26:08.935 --> 00:26:12.263
I guess there's a fine line between tooting your own horn,

601
00:26:12.263 --> 00:26:15.068
and reaching out to the public and letting them know

602
00:26:15.068 --> 00:26:17.471
the real value that they're abusing.

603
00:26:17.471 --> 00:26:19.444
<v ->I was very pleasantly surprised to find out</v>

604
00:26:19.444 --> 00:26:21.748
about SC Johnson.

605
00:26:21.748 --> 00:26:24.313
I was shocked, actually.

606
00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:26.505
That's one of the last places I would have looked

607
00:26:26.505 --> 00:26:29.086
for environmental responsibility

608
00:26:29.086 --> 00:26:31.518
simply because I was ignorant of their story.

609
00:26:31.518 --> 00:26:34.590
<v ->I say this, and I have no incentive to say this at all,</v>

610
00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:36.782
but I really believe that Fisk Johnson,

611
00:26:36.782 --> 00:26:39.374
the CEO of SC Johnson takes it to heart.

612
00:26:39.374 --> 00:26:43.138
I really believe that deep down, just like John Mackey

613
00:26:43.138 --> 00:26:46.434
of Whole Foods, or the leaders of these companies,

614
00:26:46.434 --> 00:26:49.346
Yvon Chouinard, I believe that this is so important

615
00:26:49.346 --> 00:26:53.543
to him, and he's going to continue with this path.

616
00:26:53.543 --> 00:26:55.197
It's a privately owned company,

617
00:26:55.197 --> 00:26:56.658
so they can do what they want.

618
00:26:56.658 --> 00:26:58.631
They don't have to worry about if it costs

619
00:26:58.631 --> 00:27:00.050
a little more upfront.

620
00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:01.745
For them, it actually hasn't.

621
00:27:01.745 --> 00:27:03.857
It's saved them money in a lot of areas,

622
00:27:03.857 --> 00:27:05.671
and it's made them money in others.

623
00:27:05.671 --> 00:27:06.944
That's a good thing, too.

624
00:27:06.999 --> 00:27:10.273
<v ->A big one, big one in the modern,</v>

625
00:27:10.273 --> 00:27:13.132
the culture of modern consumerism,

626
00:27:13.132 --> 00:27:14.753
which is Ikea.

627
00:27:14.753 --> 00:27:15.937
<v ->I love Ikea.</v>

628
00:27:17.717 --> 00:27:19.042
<v ->A good story.</v>

629
00:27:19.042 --> 00:27:22.626
<v ->It is because Ikea was founded</v>

630
00:27:24.256 --> 00:27:28.081
by an eccentric...

631
00:27:29.729 --> 00:27:31.820
I can never pronounce his name,

632
00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.073
Ingvar Kamprad is the name of the founder,

633
00:27:35.073 --> 00:27:37.206
and I apologize to him if I just mispronounced

634
00:27:37.206 --> 00:27:38.209
his name.

635
00:27:38.209 --> 00:27:39.670
<v ->I'm glad you said it because I was wondering</v>

636
00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:41.248
if I was going to have to say it.

637
00:27:41.248 --> 00:27:45.707
<v ->He was ridiculed by the press for a track that he wrote</v>

638
00:27:45.707 --> 00:27:49.132
in 1970, I think it was '78 when the company was founded,

639
00:27:49.132 --> 00:27:51.084
around that time, saying,

640
00:27:51.084 --> 00:27:55.638
"Everyone who works here is equal, we are egalitarian,

641
00:27:57.108 --> 00:27:59.638
"Let's forge ahead with this great vision."

642
00:27:59.638 --> 00:28:01.568
He had this great language, which I'm, of course,

643
00:28:01.568 --> 00:28:05.462
misquoting, but it was this very esoteric, spiritual,

644
00:28:05.462 --> 00:28:09.184
almost like a utopian stance on what he wanted

645
00:28:09.184 --> 00:28:11.040
his company to be about.

646
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.474
The press, especially in the UK, who can be brutal,

647
00:28:14.474 --> 00:28:17.493
would completely just rip on him

648
00:28:17.493 --> 00:28:20.298
and make it sound like it was some kind of a cult.

649
00:28:20.298 --> 00:28:21.439
Give me a break.

650
00:28:21.439 --> 00:28:22.639
What was fascinating is we looked

651
00:28:22.639 --> 00:28:25.540
at how that, quote, "cult" grew to be one of the most

652
00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:28.474
dominating and successful retailers

653
00:28:28.474 --> 00:28:30.116
in the history of retailing.

654
00:28:31.776 --> 00:28:33.780
What happens within an Ikea store,

655
00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.895
and what happens behind the scenes is just fascinating.

656
00:28:38.585 --> 00:28:41.539
That company exists to

657
00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:47.700
bring the masses something that they feel separated from,

658
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:51.465
which is this ability to have really nice things.

659
00:28:51.465 --> 00:28:52.713
<v ->To live stylishly.</v>

660
00:28:52.713 --> 00:28:54.355
<v ->To live stylishly.</v>

661
00:28:54.756 --> 00:28:57.358
They treat the people in their company in such a way.

662
00:28:57.358 --> 00:29:00.184
They have, actually, anti-bureaucracy weeks

663
00:29:00.184 --> 00:29:01.976
where the people in the board room

664
00:29:01.976 --> 00:29:03.502
actually go to the sales floor,

665
00:29:03.502 --> 00:29:06.125
the people on the sales floor go to corporate

666
00:29:06.125 --> 00:29:09.123
and they're constantly shifting ideas back and forth

667
00:29:09.123 --> 00:29:10.776
between those two groups.

668
00:29:10.776 --> 00:29:14.626
Everyone can be who they are, there is very little

669
00:29:14.626 --> 00:29:18.455
political undertone at that company, and, again,

670
00:29:18.455 --> 00:29:20.621
they have that good enough never is mentality.

671
00:29:20.621 --> 00:29:22.520
They're not arrogant and, again, that's why you don't

672
00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.589
think of them as a responsible company because

673
00:29:24.589 --> 00:29:27.235
they don't talk about it, they don't toot their own horn.

674
00:29:27.235 --> 00:29:28.792
<v ->You think of them as big and cheap.</v>

675
00:29:28.792 --> 00:29:29.762
<v ->That's right.</v>

676
00:29:29.762 --> 00:29:30.904
<v ->And stylish.</v>

677
00:29:30.904 --> 00:29:33.037
<v ->The difference between their model is that</v>

678
00:29:33.037 --> 00:29:34.893
it's not cheap at any cost.

679
00:29:34.893 --> 00:29:36.194
<v ->Right, right.</v>

680
00:29:37.484 --> 00:29:40.328
<v ->They're extremely frugal, and that even means</v>

681
00:29:40.328 --> 00:29:43.133
in terms of the resources they use, which is why

682
00:29:43.133 --> 00:29:46.034
they'll use particle board and things like that

683
00:29:46.034 --> 00:29:49.106
because their environmental integrity of that

684
00:29:49.106 --> 00:29:52.146
kind of thing is much better than, even,

685
00:29:53.776 --> 00:29:55.637
sustainably sourced wood.

686
00:29:55.637 --> 00:29:57.866
It's much easier on the environment.

687
00:29:57.866 --> 00:29:59.487
That's why they're making furniture

688
00:29:59.487 --> 00:30:01.162
out of recycled egg cartons.

689
00:30:02.862 --> 00:30:05.919
<v ->Part of their philosophy, which I found interesting,</v>

690
00:30:05.919 --> 00:30:10.708
is that the whole, you build it yourself at home element,

691
00:30:10.708 --> 00:30:13.961
is actually part of his belief system,

692
00:30:13.961 --> 00:30:17.886
in that hard work, and participation, and building,

693
00:30:17.886 --> 00:30:19.763
and creating is good for a person.

694
00:30:19.763 --> 00:30:23.368
<v ->It's very socialistic, almost communist, it's fascinating,</v>

695
00:30:23.368 --> 00:30:25.758
but it works, and that is why you have to set up

696
00:30:25.758 --> 00:30:27.262
your own furniture.

697
00:30:28.682 --> 00:30:32.314
One of his philosophies is to help people help themselves.

698
00:30:32.314 --> 00:30:35.823
That literally means that customers help themselves,

699
00:30:35.823 --> 00:30:38.681
but helping themselves, he also meant it like,

700
00:30:38.681 --> 00:30:41.134
just like you're saying, hard work is good for you.

701
00:30:41.134 --> 00:30:42.606
It's good for you that you got to

702
00:30:42.606 --> 00:30:43.758
put this furniture together.

703
00:30:43.758 --> 00:30:47.363
By the way, flat shipping it saves enormously on CO2,

704
00:30:47.363 --> 00:30:49.379
which is another thing people don't really think about,

705
00:30:49.379 --> 00:30:50.424
but it's true.

706
00:30:50.424 --> 00:30:52.398
<v ->Yes, that makes total sense, and packaging,</v>

707
00:30:52.398 --> 00:30:55.395
and resources in terms of forestry industry.

708
00:30:55.395 --> 00:30:57.133
It must be working.

709
00:30:57.133 --> 00:30:59.896
Another thing I picked up out of the book was that,

710
00:30:59.896 --> 00:31:02.456
I think you mentioned in Britain, that there are more

711
00:31:02.456 --> 00:31:05.495
Ikea catalogs read on a Sunday than the Bible.

712
00:31:05.495 --> 00:31:06.621
<v ->It is true.</v>

713
00:31:06.621 --> 00:31:09.031
<v ->That's some real penetration as a market.</v>

714
00:31:09.031 --> 00:31:12.402
<v ->There are more Ikeas printed, and distributed,</v>

715
00:31:12.402 --> 00:31:13.778
and out there right now.

716
00:31:13.778 --> 00:31:16.860
They say that something like, I think it's like a quart,

717
00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:20.273
no, I can't remember what statistic I reported.

718
00:31:20.273 --> 00:31:21.495
It's a true statistic.

719
00:31:21.495 --> 00:31:24.332
Maybe it's an eighth of all people in certain areas

720
00:31:24.332 --> 00:31:26.145
were conceived on an Ikea bed.

721
00:31:26.145 --> 00:31:29.740
It's something like such a ridiculous penetration

722
00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:34.358
and such an incredible company that it's become,

723
00:31:35.878 --> 00:31:38.454
and it's fascinating because the frenzy around Ikea

724
00:31:38.454 --> 00:31:39.680
is so significant.

725
00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.787
We found extreme Ikea advocates that have websites

726
00:31:43.787 --> 00:31:48.533
that are dedicated to Ikea and the values of the founder.

727
00:31:49.713 --> 00:31:51.178
We talked to some of those bloggers.

728
00:31:51.178 --> 00:31:52.821
We're like, "Why are you spending your day

729
00:31:52.821 --> 00:31:55.344
"talking about Ikea? Don't you have anything better to do?"

730
00:31:55.344 --> 00:31:58.159
Their stories why they're doing it is very interesting.

731
00:31:58.159 --> 00:32:01.818
People are just drawn to the company

732
00:32:01.818 --> 00:32:04.122
because what the company's doing,

733
00:32:04.122 --> 00:32:06.372
it's more than just a retail company.

734
00:32:06.372 --> 00:32:08.623
There's something happening at Ikea

735
00:32:08.623 --> 00:32:13.497
this fascinating, esoteric quality that it offers people,

736
00:32:13.497 --> 00:32:16.078
it is so authentic.

737
00:32:16.078 --> 00:32:18.211
Just the way you walk in and the sign that says,

738
00:32:18.211 --> 00:32:21.241
"Valkommen," and the Swedish meatballs.

739
00:32:21.241 --> 00:32:25.624
It's like Disneyworld, but it's a very engaging model,

740
00:32:25.624 --> 00:32:28.046
and it's something that other retailers have, thus far,

741
00:32:28.046 --> 00:32:30.685
not been able to replicate, at least not on a mass scale.

742
00:32:31.006 --> 00:32:33.608
<v ->They really insist that the employee,</v>

743
00:32:33.608 --> 00:32:36.179
which is called a coworker, actually,

744
00:32:36.179 --> 00:32:39.944
that the coworkers invest themselves in it,

745
00:32:39.944 --> 00:32:42.770
before they even begin, by reading,

746
00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:44.562
I don't know what you call it,

747
00:32:44.562 --> 00:32:46.930
not their corporation bible, but the story

748
00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:49.554
of their company, and understanding the philosophy.

749
00:32:49.554 --> 00:32:52.316
They have to read this book before they even

750
00:32:52.316 --> 00:32:54.270
take their place on the floor to help people.

751
00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:56.062
They're really part of the program.

752
00:32:56.062 --> 00:32:57.620
<v ->They're part of the philosophy.</v>

753
00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.727
They're part of the experience that is Ikea,

754
00:32:59.727 --> 00:33:01.326
which is a neat one.

755
00:33:01.326 --> 00:33:02.116
<v ->It is.</v>

756
00:33:02.116 --> 00:33:05.038
One company that you mention in here as the ultimate

757
00:33:05.038 --> 00:33:06.969
high purpose company, which I was also

758
00:33:06.969 --> 00:33:10.478
very intrigued with is Wainwright Bank &amp; Trust.

759
00:33:10.478 --> 00:33:13.198
<v ->That's my favorite bank in the entire world.</v>

760
00:33:13.198 --> 00:33:15.587
<v ->Talk about that because we're at a very adversarial--</v>

761
00:33:15.587 --> 00:33:17.054
<v ->Besides Muhammad Yunus and his work,</v>

762
00:33:17.054 --> 00:33:18.216
which I also love.

763
00:33:18.216 --> 00:33:19.891
<v ->Let's talk about both of them because</v>

764
00:33:19.891 --> 00:33:22.931
I think a lot of people have an innate distrust

765
00:33:22.931 --> 00:33:24.680
of the banks, especially if they've learned

766
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.880
anything about the industry.

767
00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.991
Let's talk about why they're different.

768
00:33:29.991 --> 00:33:30.706
<v ->Sure.</v>

769
00:33:30.706 --> 00:33:33.362
Wainwright has danced to its own tune,

770
00:33:33.362 --> 00:33:34.471
just like Ikea.

771
00:33:34.471 --> 00:33:36.103
That's really interesting that some of these companies

772
00:33:36.103 --> 00:33:38.834
have in common, they do not follow the herd.

773
00:33:38.834 --> 00:33:41.372
They figure out what it is they stand for,

774
00:33:41.372 --> 00:33:42.673
and they go for it.

775
00:33:42.673 --> 00:33:44.711
They don't care if they step on toes,

776
00:33:44.711 --> 00:33:47.270
or if they offend people, they're true to their core.

777
00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:49.440
They're authentic.

778
00:33:50.374 --> 00:33:52.561
Wainwright could not be more authentic.

779
00:33:52.561 --> 00:33:56.624
That is a Boston based bank that,

780
00:33:56.624 --> 00:33:59.824
since its inception, has stood for social justice issues.

781
00:33:59.824 --> 00:34:02.640
When I say stood for social justice issues,

782
00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.608
I don't mean just throwing some money at a philanthropy

783
00:34:06.608 --> 00:34:08.720
or doing a little promotion here and there,

784
00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:13.690
I mean lobbying hard for the rights of same sex couples,

785
00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:17.615
and for people living with AIDS, and for the homeless,

786
00:34:17.615 --> 00:34:20.634
and reverse engineering banking products,

787
00:34:20.634 --> 00:34:23.044
lending products that meet the needs of

788
00:34:23.044 --> 00:34:25.828
disenfranchised members of their community,

789
00:34:25.828 --> 00:34:28.846
and becoming one of the most successful banks

790
00:34:28.846 --> 00:34:33.561
in terms of customer retention, loyalty, repeat business

791
00:34:33.561 --> 00:34:36.185
because of that stance.

792
00:34:36.185 --> 00:34:39.278
They have literally treaded where no other

793
00:34:39.278 --> 00:34:42.414
American bank that I could find has ever treaded.

794
00:34:42.414 --> 00:34:44.451
Not enough people know about them.

795
00:34:44.451 --> 00:34:46.285
More people need to know more about

796
00:34:46.285 --> 00:34:47.885
what Wainwright is doing.

797
00:34:47.885 --> 00:34:50.253
I think they are probably the most progressive

798
00:34:50.253 --> 00:34:52.626
bank in America, no question.

799
00:34:53.193 --> 00:34:54.259
<v ->Your book's doing well.</v>

800
00:34:54.259 --> 00:34:56.350
Hopefully more people will know as a result of that.

801
00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:57.337
<v ->I hope so.</v>

802
00:34:57.337 --> 00:34:58.873
<v ->What was the other person you mentioned, or entity</v>

803
00:34:58.873 --> 00:35:01.240
you mentioned that you liked as well as Wainwright?

804
00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.139
You just said a name a bit ago.

805
00:35:03.139 --> 00:35:04.973
I didn't catch it or write it down at the time.

806
00:35:04.973 --> 00:35:07.672
<v ->Oh, the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh,</v>

807
00:35:07.672 --> 00:35:09.091
Muhammad Yunus's bank?

808
00:35:09.091 --> 00:35:09.955
<v ->Yes.</v>

809
00:35:09.955 --> 00:35:12.952
<v ->That was a story that I covered in my first book,</v>

810
00:35:12.952 --> 00:35:15.575
Cause For Success, and Muhammad Yunus,

811
00:35:15.575 --> 00:35:18.114
he's known as a banker to the poor.

812
00:35:18.114 --> 00:35:20.386
In fact, he just won a Nobel Prize.

813
00:35:20.386 --> 00:35:22.796
When I was writing the book, and when I was

814
00:35:22.796 --> 00:35:26.679
engaging with him through that interview process,

815
00:35:26.679 --> 00:35:30.828
it was rumored that he was in contention for that

816
00:35:30.828 --> 00:35:34.550
Nobel Prize, but he hadn't been awarded the prize yet.

817
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:39.094
What he does is he goes into, obviously Bangladesh,

818
00:35:39.094 --> 00:35:42.816
he goes into local villages, and is especially interested

819
00:35:42.816 --> 00:35:47.104
in helping women raise themselves above the poverty line

820
00:35:47.104 --> 00:35:48.661
through micro lending.

821
00:35:48.661 --> 00:35:52.075
He was one of the pioneers of micro lending

822
00:35:52.075 --> 00:35:53.824
and micro finance.

823
00:35:53.824 --> 00:35:57.418
His model has been extraordinarily successful,

824
00:35:57.418 --> 00:35:59.903
and it's been replicated all over the world at this point.

825
00:35:59.903 --> 00:36:01.087
<v ->When you say micro lending,</v>

826
00:36:01.087 --> 00:36:03.807
we're talking about loans as little as $500--

827
00:36:03.807 --> 00:36:05.546
<v ->Or even $5.</v>

828
00:36:05.546 --> 00:36:09.023
<v ->Or $300 or two, yes, exactly, to really get someone--</v>

829
00:36:09.023 --> 00:36:10.399
<v ->We're talking small.</v>

830
00:36:11.779 --> 00:36:16.384
He's put systems in place that deal with the realities

831
00:36:16.384 --> 00:36:19.765
faced by these people, faced by people

832
00:36:19.765 --> 00:36:23.178
who rely on each other for support,

833
00:36:23.178 --> 00:36:25.183
so he forms little support groups

834
00:36:25.183 --> 00:36:27.103
and everybody takes responsibility

835
00:36:27.103 --> 00:36:29.012
for everybody else's loan.

836
00:36:29.012 --> 00:36:31.658
It's almost like a co op or something because

837
00:36:31.658 --> 00:36:35.518
they keep each other in line,

838
00:36:35.518 --> 00:36:36.724
they keep each other honest,

839
00:36:36.724 --> 00:36:38.046
not that they wouldn't be honest.

840
00:36:38.046 --> 00:36:39.369
People are extremely honest.

841
00:36:39.369 --> 00:36:44.243
In fact, he's proven that the poor, they're so noble

842
00:36:44.243 --> 00:36:46.846
and they're so consistent in terms of paying

843
00:36:46.846 --> 00:36:50.067
their loans back, that his repayment and default rate,

844
00:36:50.067 --> 00:36:55.067
he has a 99.5, I think, percent rate of repay

845
00:36:55.112 --> 00:36:57.106
on the loans he issues.

846
00:36:57.106 --> 00:36:59.826
If you can find me one major American bank

847
00:36:59.826 --> 00:37:01.821
that can say the same thing, especially now

848
00:37:01.821 --> 00:37:04.487
with all the defaults going on and mortgages and so forth,

849
00:37:04.487 --> 00:37:05.949
that's astonishing.

850
00:37:05.949 --> 00:37:08.626
<v ->It is, in fact, there's a documentary we also feature</v>

851
00:37:08.626 --> 00:37:10.226
on our site called In Debt We Trust,

852
00:37:10.226 --> 00:37:13.063
and that was a point that he made quite well.

853
00:37:13.063 --> 00:37:17.031
I think the twist to that one, as I recall,

854
00:37:17.031 --> 00:37:21.372
is that a lot of the traditional banking industry

855
00:37:21.372 --> 00:37:25.414
take advantage of those who are in an

856
00:37:25.414 --> 00:37:30.235
economically disenfranchised group, and charge them

857
00:37:30.235 --> 00:37:33.350
extraordinarily high rates of interest for small loans,

858
00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:36.784
knowing that the character of these people

859
00:37:36.784 --> 00:37:41.082
is honest by nature, and they exploit it.

860
00:37:42.022 --> 00:37:44.378
<v ->That's the way our whole financial system works.</v>

861
00:37:44.378 --> 00:37:47.941
People who need loans the most

862
00:37:47.941 --> 00:37:50.138
are the least likely to get them,

863
00:37:50.138 --> 00:37:53.487
and the people who really don't need money

864
00:37:53.487 --> 00:37:55.695
or credit get tons of it.

865
00:37:55.695 --> 00:37:57.828
<v ->And they're the ones least likely to pay it back,</v>

866
00:37:57.828 --> 00:38:00.964
and default on these multi-million dollar loans.

867
00:38:00.964 --> 00:38:03.054
<v ->In America, it's slightly different, but yes,</v>

868
00:38:03.054 --> 00:38:06.094
many of them are, especially if they are

869
00:38:06.094 --> 00:38:07.694
very specific loans.

870
00:38:07.694 --> 00:38:10.041
What's fascinating about this whole micro capitalism

871
00:38:10.041 --> 00:38:13.518
movement is that it's moved from institutional

872
00:38:13.518 --> 00:38:15.683
in the sense that a bank is lending,

873
00:38:15.683 --> 00:38:19.053
to private and there are a couple of websites

874
00:38:19.053 --> 00:38:22.130
out there where you can actually...

875
00:38:23.138 --> 00:38:24.331
I wish I remember the name of it.

876
00:38:24.331 --> 00:38:25.506
It's terrible to blank out on it.

877
00:38:25.506 --> 00:38:26.469
<v ->If you remember when we're done here,</v>

878
00:38:26.469 --> 00:38:27.577
I'll go ahead and put it up on the site.

879
00:38:27.577 --> 00:38:30.584
<v ->Please do, because you can actually go and learn about</v>

880
00:38:30.584 --> 00:38:33.550
people all over the world and what their needs are,

881
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:36.985
and sometimes they need as little as $50 or $100

882
00:38:36.985 --> 00:38:40.099
and you can directly finance someone who wants to

883
00:38:40.099 --> 00:38:43.816
sell peanut butter in Malaysia.

884
00:38:43.816 --> 00:38:45.885
It's fascinating, I'm not kidding.

885
00:38:45.885 --> 00:38:49.629
It's so neat 'cause you form a personal relationship

886
00:38:49.629 --> 00:38:50.760
with these people.

887
00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:54.525
You're helping them. Your $50 goes a long way.

888
00:38:54.525 --> 00:38:57.895
Then, you can take the money when you finally

889
00:38:57.895 --> 00:38:59.986
get paid back, and you can lend it somewhere else.

890
00:38:59.986 --> 00:39:01.565
<v ->That's global community.</v>

891
00:39:01.565 --> 00:39:02.674
<v ->It is, yes.</v>

892
00:39:02.674 --> 00:39:06.524
<v ->That's interesting, it's heartwarming, it's promising</v>

893
00:39:06.524 --> 00:39:08.493
for developing countries.

894
00:39:08.493 --> 00:39:11.415
<v ->And it's enabled by technology because you're learning</v>

895
00:39:11.415 --> 00:39:13.527
about these people over the web,

896
00:39:13.527 --> 00:39:15.650
you're enabling them to, in a sense,

897
00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:17.388
join the global economy.

898
00:39:17.388 --> 00:39:19.820
<v ->Funds can be transferred over the web,</v>

899
00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.889
so it makes it much easier to do the transactions

900
00:39:21.889 --> 00:39:23.031
in general.

901
00:39:23.031 --> 00:39:24.097
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

902
00:39:24.097 --> 00:39:28.044
<v ->Does this, on perhaps a different scale,</v>

903
00:39:28.044 --> 00:39:31.275
translate to how Wainwright functions as well?

904
00:39:31.275 --> 00:39:32.385
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

905
00:39:32.385 --> 00:39:36.426
Wainwright, again, they are

906
00:39:36.426 --> 00:39:40.892
very much a company that,

907
00:39:40.892 --> 00:39:43.228
they make smart, strategic decisions,

908
00:39:43.228 --> 00:39:46.520
but there's heart there, and that heart is so obvious.

909
00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.239
If you go into a Wainwright bank,

910
00:39:49.239 --> 00:39:51.469
people don't dress like bankers.

911
00:39:51.469 --> 00:39:53.740
They don't act like bankers.

912
00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:56.855
Even the policies they instill for their employees,

913
00:39:56.855 --> 00:39:59.756
giving health benefits to same sex couples,

914
00:39:59.756 --> 00:40:02.775
and making sure that everyone feels comfortable

915
00:40:02.775 --> 00:40:04.428
with who they are as a person

916
00:40:04.428 --> 00:40:06.913
and able to express that at work.

917
00:40:06.913 --> 00:40:09.398
Like I said, those responsive lending products,

918
00:40:09.398 --> 00:40:13.483
that socially progressive, their core target audience

919
00:40:13.483 --> 00:40:16.843
are progressives in the Boston community.

920
00:40:16.843 --> 00:40:18.870
They are a progressive bank.

921
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:21.536
In fact, they call the mode of banking they do

922
00:40:21.536 --> 00:40:23.397
"socially progressive banking."

923
00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.389
They've been shunned for a lot of industry awards

924
00:40:26.389 --> 00:40:28.576
that they should have won, but because people

925
00:40:28.576 --> 00:40:30.965
are afraid to support them because they go to bat

926
00:40:30.965 --> 00:40:34.751
against the war, they go to bat for controversial

927
00:40:34.751 --> 00:40:37.567
issues that no other bank would touch with a ten foot pole.

928
00:40:37.567 --> 00:40:40.351
That's why they're so successful, but that's why

929
00:40:40.351 --> 00:40:42.024
I say more people need to know what they're doing.

930
00:40:42.024 --> 00:40:44.198
<v ->I think you said in the book, I don't know if it's</v>

931
00:40:44.198 --> 00:40:46.821
their official corporate motto but, "End in justice."

932
00:40:46.821 --> 00:40:47.568
<v ->Yes.</v>

933
00:40:47.568 --> 00:40:49.957
<v ->Ending in justice is really what their corporate</v>

934
00:40:49.957 --> 00:40:53.328
goal or their, however you call it,

935
00:40:53.328 --> 00:40:54.810
their high purpose is.

936
00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:56.346
<v ->Their higher purpose, right, or their goal.</v>

937
00:40:56.346 --> 00:40:59.478
<v ->Let's talk about another bank, HSBC,</v>

938
00:40:59.478 --> 00:41:01.589
while we're on the banking industry.

939
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:03.728
You talk about some of the progress made

940
00:41:03.728 --> 00:41:05.499
regarding HSBC.

941
00:41:05.499 --> 00:41:08.283
This is a huge corporation, a huge bank,

942
00:41:08.283 --> 00:41:10.241
so let's look at it the other end and some of the

943
00:41:10.241 --> 00:41:13.825
progress you're seeing even with the large banks.

944
00:41:13.825 --> 00:41:14.725
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

945
00:41:14.884 --> 00:41:17.231
With HSBC, a lot of it has to do with what's called

946
00:41:17.231 --> 00:41:20.222
transparency, or the banks saying,

947
00:41:20.222 --> 00:41:21.903
"Here's who we're going to finance,

948
00:41:21.903 --> 00:41:23.225
"here's who we're not going to finance.

949
00:41:23.225 --> 00:41:24.740
"Let's talk to people about that.

950
00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.873
"Let's talk to people about the net result of

951
00:41:26.873 --> 00:41:29.038
"even our way of doing business.

952
00:41:29.038 --> 00:41:30.873
"Let's talk about the impact we have

953
00:41:30.873 --> 00:41:33.518
"on local communities and the environment,

954
00:41:33.518 --> 00:41:35.118
"and let's be really open about that."

955
00:41:35.118 --> 00:41:38.552
I think that's what struck me about what HSBC was doing,

956
00:41:38.552 --> 00:41:40.813
and also, they took this position, and they are

957
00:41:40.813 --> 00:41:42.552
one of the world's biggest banks.

958
00:41:43.392 --> 00:41:46.920
From HSBC saying things like,

959
00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.320
"We are going to take a leadership position

960
00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:53.746
"on global warming before this was the thing to do,"

961
00:41:53.746 --> 00:41:55.815
they were first mover.

962
00:41:55.815 --> 00:41:57.671
That's fascinating.

963
00:41:57.671 --> 00:42:01.415
Imagine the financial power this one organization has

964
00:42:01.415 --> 00:42:04.785
when they decide to put their resources behind something.

965
00:42:04.785 --> 00:42:07.078
That's what's so amazing about these big companies.

966
00:42:07.078 --> 00:42:08.870
It's like with Wal-Mart, probably one of the most

967
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:10.193
contentious examples.

968
00:42:10.193 --> 00:42:13.862
Certainly not a perfect company, but when they decide

969
00:42:13.862 --> 00:42:16.923
to sell organic, they become the largest retailer

970
00:42:16.923 --> 00:42:19.440
of organic practically overnight.

971
00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.499
<v ->Right, and that's been hotly debated.</v>

972
00:42:21.499 --> 00:42:23.212
<v ->Absolutely, the effect of that.</v>

973
00:42:23.222 --> 00:42:24.969
<v ->The effect of that, yes.</v>

974
00:42:24.969 --> 00:42:28.404
Nonetheless, when we're looking at the big picture,

975
00:42:28.404 --> 00:42:31.241
there are always major bumps along the way.

976
00:42:31.241 --> 00:42:34.121
<v ->Sure, and also, if you think about middle America,</v>

977
00:42:34.121 --> 00:42:35.646
and the people who shop at Wal-Mart--

978
00:42:35.646 --> 00:42:37.366
<v ->Introducing organics, exactly.</v>

979
00:42:37.366 --> 00:42:38.923
<v ->Maybe they couldn't afford organic before,</v>

980
00:42:38.923 --> 00:42:41.051
and now they can, or maybe they weren't as aware

981
00:42:41.051 --> 00:42:43.557
of the importance of organic or sustainable fishing,

982
00:42:43.557 --> 00:42:45.616
another issue Wal-Mart has taken on.

983
00:42:46.881 --> 00:42:48.118
<v ->That's the upside.</v>

984
00:42:48.118 --> 00:42:50.689
Those are the upsides and the downsides we know about.

985
00:42:50.689 --> 00:42:52.107
You can probably find some things on the site

986
00:42:52.107 --> 00:42:54.155
talking about some of the downsides.

987
00:42:54.155 --> 00:42:57.494
Some say it dilutes the organic standard, for example,

988
00:42:57.494 --> 00:43:00.907
because they have such a large presence that they can.

989
00:43:00.907 --> 00:43:03.381
<v ->'Cause you're having to produce on a mass scale.</v>

990
00:43:03.381 --> 00:43:05.056
<v ->Again, if you're going to be a pragmatist</v>

991
00:43:05.056 --> 00:43:07.168
and look at the evolution of business,

992
00:43:07.168 --> 00:43:10.464
the evolution of health and consciousness in the species,

993
00:43:10.464 --> 00:43:11.627
it's a bumpy ride.

994
00:43:11.627 --> 00:43:14.400
<v ->It is, and like you were saying before,</v>

995
00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.723
you need to start somewhere.

996
00:43:15.723 --> 00:43:16.341
<v ->Right.</v>

997
00:43:16.341 --> 00:43:19.018
<v ->It is not possible for Ford Motor Company,</v>

998
00:43:19.018 --> 00:43:21.664
Jumpstart Ford is this activist group that's always

999
00:43:21.664 --> 00:43:23.146
all over Ford about,

1000
00:43:23.146 --> 00:43:24.565
"You're not doing enough, you're not doing enough,

1001
00:43:24.565 --> 00:43:25.791
"you're not doing enough."

1002
00:43:25.791 --> 00:43:27.861
So Ford introduced a hybrid vehicle,

1003
00:43:27.861 --> 00:43:29.930
and they criticized them for not producing enough.

1004
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:31.626
They only produced 25,000.

1005
00:43:31.626 --> 00:43:34.228
The next year, they produced 250,000,

1006
00:43:34.228 --> 00:43:36.404
and, again, they said, "That's not enough."

1007
00:43:36.404 --> 00:43:39.380
Then they invested $2 billion trying to make,

1008
00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:42.420
probably one of the most environmentally advanced

1009
00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:44.745
manufacturing facilities on the planet, again,

1010
00:43:44.745 --> 00:43:45.950
that wasn't enough.

1011
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:47.646
What the company is invovled in,

1012
00:43:47.646 --> 00:43:50.153
my argument is those companies are investing

1013
00:43:50.153 --> 00:43:54.568
in process change, not PR, not greenwashing.

1014
00:43:54.568 --> 00:43:57.341
There is a big difference between process change

1015
00:43:57.341 --> 00:44:00.285
and greenwashing, and by following the money trail,

1016
00:44:00.285 --> 00:44:02.909
which is exactly what we did, we analyzed these companies,

1017
00:44:02.909 --> 00:44:05.213
we followed the money trail, where's the money going?

1018
00:44:05.213 --> 00:44:08.227
Is it being reinvested, how is it being reinvested,

1019
00:44:08.227 --> 00:44:10.680
and is it producing enough returns to warrant

1020
00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:13.912
that continual cycle of self-improvement?

1021
00:44:13.912 --> 00:44:17.677
People need to be better at distinguishing between

1022
00:44:17.677 --> 00:44:20.973
true and false corporate responsibility or greenwashing

1023
00:44:20.973 --> 00:44:23.479
and green growth, which is something that just

1024
00:44:23.479 --> 00:44:24.642
doesn't happen on a dime.

1025
00:44:24.642 --> 00:44:28.311
You can't turn the Titanic on a dime.

1026
00:44:28.311 --> 00:44:31.095
<v ->Care to talk about a few companies on the other side</v>

1027
00:44:31.095 --> 00:44:34.658
that, right now, you write off, don't appear

1028
00:44:34.658 --> 00:44:36.435
to be making any progress whatsoever

1029
00:44:36.435 --> 00:44:38.546
or even attempting to besides throwing more

1030
00:44:38.546 --> 00:44:40.239
advertising dollars at it?

1031
00:44:40.239 --> 00:44:43.044
<v ->I don't know what is going on with Halliburton.</v>

1032
00:44:43.044 --> 00:44:45.604
<v ->Oh, well, there.</v>

1033
00:44:45.604 --> 00:44:48.782
I don't think I would throw the towel away

1034
00:44:48.782 --> 00:44:50.147
on any company, though.

1035
00:44:50.147 --> 00:44:52.568
I don't think I would, and it's not--

1036
00:44:52.568 --> 00:44:54.030
<v ->Even Haliburton?</v>

1037
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:55.054
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1038
00:44:55.054 --> 00:44:58.691
If Halliburton would talk to me, people say,

1039
00:44:58.691 --> 00:44:59.992
"Who would you work with?"

1040
00:44:59.992 --> 00:45:01.389
I haven't worked with any of these companies yet

1041
00:45:01.389 --> 00:45:02.989
'cause I wanted to keep distance,

1042
00:45:02.989 --> 00:45:04.962
but if Halliburton called and said,

1043
00:45:04.962 --> 00:45:07.704
"We'd like you to come in and present to us.

1044
00:45:07.704 --> 00:45:09.239
"We'd like you to do some research on us,

1045
00:45:09.239 --> 00:45:10.861
"and come back and help us figure,"

1046
00:45:10.861 --> 00:45:12.439
I would definitely do it.

1047
00:45:12.439 --> 00:45:14.092
That's horrible.

1048
00:45:14.092 --> 00:45:16.642
People are like, "Why would you work to advance interest?"

1049
00:45:16.642 --> 00:45:19.265
Well, because those are the most damaging companies.

1050
00:45:19.265 --> 00:45:21.591
Who wants to work with a perfect company

1051
00:45:21.591 --> 00:45:23.212
that's already doing such a great job

1052
00:45:23.212 --> 00:45:23.863
they're already--

1053
00:45:23.863 --> 00:45:25.025
<v ->They don't need you.</v>

1054
00:45:25.025 --> 00:45:26.326
<v ->On the path.</v>

1055
00:45:26.326 --> 00:45:29.185
What about the companies that are off-kilter

1056
00:45:29.185 --> 00:45:30.390
a little bit?

1057
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:31.649
<v ->A little bit.</v>

1058
00:45:31.649 --> 00:45:34.667
<v ->It is a little bit, or Monsanto.</v>

1059
00:45:34.667 --> 00:45:36.960
I would love to get my hands on Monsanto.

1060
00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:40.241
Whether they would want to work for me is completely

1061
00:45:40.241 --> 00:45:42.858
after reading my book, something else.

1062
00:45:43.163 --> 00:45:46.395
<v ->We interviewed another man who did have business</v>

1063
00:45:46.395 --> 00:45:48.944
on a corporate level working with corporate

1064
00:45:48.944 --> 00:45:52.432
teambuilding at Halliburton,

1065
00:45:52.432 --> 00:45:55.674
and he said the interesting thing he found

1066
00:45:55.674 --> 00:45:59.717
is that if you got the various managers aside,

1067
00:45:59.717 --> 00:46:00.871
one on one, individually--

1068
00:46:00.871 --> 00:46:02.897
<v ->Individually, they think they're doing the right thing.</v>

1069
00:46:02.897 --> 00:46:06.283
<v ->They wanted to do more or better,</v>

1070
00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.806
but everyone one of them had the same fear

1071
00:46:08.806 --> 00:46:11.078
and spoke in hush tones, and was afraid

1072
00:46:11.078 --> 00:46:12.465
of losing their job--

1073
00:46:12.465 --> 00:46:14.075
<v ->Don't tell anyone I'm saying this, of course.</v>

1074
00:46:14.075 --> 00:46:16.091
<v ->And feeling threatened if they thought</v>

1075
00:46:16.091 --> 00:46:18.256
any of their other coworkers or other management

1076
00:46:18.256 --> 00:46:21.104
knew that they were not satisfied with what's going on,

1077
00:46:21.104 --> 00:46:23.248
which is a very interesting point.

1078
00:46:23.248 --> 00:46:24.218
<v ->Well, yes.</v>

1079
00:46:24.218 --> 00:46:26.149
<v ->You get down to most people, in their heart,</v>

1080
00:46:26.149 --> 00:46:28.481
know what's right, they know what's good.

1081
00:46:28.481 --> 00:46:31.360
Even if a company displays, as we said before,

1082
00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:33.451
these sociopathic tendencies, that doesn't mean

1083
00:46:33.451 --> 00:46:35.776
that all the employees follow suit.

1084
00:46:35.776 --> 00:46:38.400
<v ->Right, or it doesn't mean that the company's 100%,</v>

1085
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.957
incontestibly evil.

1086
00:46:39.957 --> 00:46:40.672
<v ->Right.</v>

1087
00:46:40.672 --> 00:46:43.136
<v ->There is no such thing as a totally evil company,</v>

1088
00:46:43.136 --> 00:46:45.269
just like there is no such thing as a totally

1089
00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:48.479
perfect company, and the same thing goes for people.

1090
00:46:48.479 --> 00:46:52.468
There are varying degrees of gray, and it's ridiculous

1091
00:46:52.468 --> 00:46:54.975
to judge these companies as good verses bad,

1092
00:46:54.975 --> 00:46:57.513
this is a lost cause, this is not a lost cause,

1093
00:46:57.513 --> 00:47:00.526
because things are always changing.

1094
00:47:01.183 --> 00:47:03.945
That's the reality, so I think there are

1095
00:47:03.945 --> 00:47:06.313
definitely people inside some companies

1096
00:47:06.313 --> 00:47:08.542
that people would consider "bad."

1097
00:47:08.542 --> 00:47:10.579
They're actually very good people that are really

1098
00:47:10.579 --> 00:47:14.686
working to move the needle, but based on the

1099
00:47:14.686 --> 00:47:18.664
psychology and the culture and maybe how everything

1100
00:47:18.664 --> 00:47:22.344
is so siloed and really hierarchical organizations,

1101
00:47:22.344 --> 00:47:24.407
it's difficult to make waves.

1102
00:47:25.373 --> 00:47:27.137
<v ->Well, it's very gracious, the way you put that.</v>

1103
00:47:29.206 --> 00:47:31.317
<v ->That's the politically pressed answer.</v>

1104
00:47:31.767 --> 00:47:34.944
<v ->It is, but there is some truth in that as well.</v>

1105
00:47:36.504 --> 00:47:39.658
Judgment is a dangerous thing. We all do it.

1106
00:47:39.658 --> 00:47:43.487
We all can see, more or less, the values

1107
00:47:43.487 --> 00:47:46.506
are fairly painted on the wall in most cases,

1108
00:47:46.506 --> 00:47:48.340
we can see that, but nonetheless,

1109
00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.967
to not give a company a chance to reverse itself

1110
00:47:51.967 --> 00:47:54.341
is probably the most dangerous mindset of all.

1111
00:47:54.341 --> 00:47:58.084
Everything should be given an opportunity to evolve.

1112
00:47:58.084 --> 00:48:00.911
Whether they take that or not appears to be the issue.

1113
00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:01.760
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1114
00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.786
<v ->Let's talk a little bit more about transparency.</v>

1115
00:48:03.786 --> 00:48:05.013
This is really big.

1116
00:48:05.013 --> 00:48:08.053
Now that we have the net, it's really hard

1117
00:48:08.053 --> 00:48:10.676
to remain cloaked in the stories.

1118
00:48:10.676 --> 00:48:11.882
<v ->It changes the game.</v>

1119
00:48:11.882 --> 00:48:13.482
<v ->It does. What do you see?</v>

1120
00:48:13.482 --> 00:48:14.761
<v ->I love it, it's fabulous.</v>

1121
00:48:14.761 --> 00:48:17.183
<v ->I do too. What do you see more as a visionary now?</v>

1122
00:48:17.183 --> 00:48:19.380
Are you writing a third book, by the way?

1123
00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:20.244
<v ->Yes.</v>

1124
00:48:20.244 --> 00:48:23.102
It's gonna be about how people trapped in the

1125
00:48:23.102 --> 00:48:25.630
Halliburtons of the world can change the game

1126
00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:28.254
'cause you gotta do change from within.

1127
00:48:28.254 --> 00:48:30.995
I've been reporting on change from the outside

1128
00:48:30.995 --> 00:48:33.502
and looking at senior management mostly,

1129
00:48:33.502 --> 00:48:36.403
but what about the people working in companies?

1130
00:48:36.403 --> 00:48:38.103
What do they do?

1131
00:48:38.693 --> 00:48:40.410
That's where I'm headed next.

1132
00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:42.422
<v ->We'll be back on that one.</v>

1133
00:48:42.422 --> 00:48:44.021
I want to hear what you have to say.

1134
00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:47.941
Let's look at, for the time being, transparency.

1135
00:48:48.603 --> 00:48:51.344
In general, what's it going to take?

1136
00:48:51.344 --> 00:48:54.202
Is every company going to have to have a flashlight

1137
00:48:54.202 --> 00:48:57.445
shown on their deepest darkest secrets,

1138
00:48:57.445 --> 00:49:01.839
or are some actually learning from the example of others?

1139
00:49:01.839 --> 00:49:04.410
<v ->Both, but here's the weird thing about transparency.</v>

1140
00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:06.244
There are a lot of companies that don't even

1141
00:49:06.244 --> 00:49:07.897
face the truth themselves.

1142
00:49:07.897 --> 00:49:08.943
<v ->True.</v>

1143
00:49:08.943 --> 00:49:10.681
<v ->They're not even totally honest.</v>

1144
00:49:10.681 --> 00:49:15.300
They talk themselves into something, this rhetoric,

1145
00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:18.809
this language they use, the stuff they say to themselves

1146
00:49:18.809 --> 00:49:20.131
like a mantra.

1147
00:49:20.131 --> 00:49:22.638
"Social responsibility is the way we do business,"

1148
00:49:22.638 --> 00:49:24.611
"It's ingrained into the DNA of our culture,"

1149
00:49:24.611 --> 00:49:27.352
all these cliches, they don't know what that really,

1150
00:49:27.352 --> 00:49:29.379
what does that really mean?

1151
00:49:29.379 --> 00:49:30.979
What does that mean in terms of the way you're

1152
00:49:30.979 --> 00:49:32.205
developing products?

1153
00:49:32.205 --> 00:49:33.624
What does that mean in terms of the way you're

1154
00:49:33.624 --> 00:49:34.808
marketing those products?

1155
00:49:34.808 --> 00:49:37.133
What does that mean in real life?

1156
00:49:37.133 --> 00:49:40.269
I think part of the transparency movement,

1157
00:49:40.269 --> 00:49:42.381
there are two forces coming together.

1158
00:49:42.381 --> 00:49:44.812
One is companies taking a long hard look

1159
00:49:44.812 --> 00:49:45.900
in the mirror and saying,

1160
00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:47.906
"How much waste are we really producing here?

1161
00:49:47.906 --> 00:49:50.711
"How much of a toll are we really taking here?"

1162
00:49:50.711 --> 00:49:52.620
Then we have to tell people about it,

1163
00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:54.870
and then we have to pledge to improve it.

1164
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:57.398
The reporting of it is one thing, but really,

1165
00:49:57.398 --> 00:49:59.766
a lot of companies don't have a firm grasp

1166
00:49:59.766 --> 00:50:02.689
on the real impact they have, and so that's a new

1167
00:50:02.689 --> 00:50:05.590
movement that's driving this as well.

1168
00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:08.427
People have access to the information through the web,

1169
00:50:08.427 --> 00:50:11.232
but the companies are now realizing that

1170
00:50:11.232 --> 00:50:14.069
if they don't put two and two together, someone else will.

1171
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:15.669
So they've got to get a grasp on it.

1172
00:50:15.669 --> 00:50:16.992
<v ->Then it's all damage control from there.</v>

1173
00:50:16.992 --> 00:50:17.641
<v ->Right.</v>

1174
00:50:18.415 --> 00:50:21.114
<v ->So some final thoughts on this before we</v>

1175
00:50:21.114 --> 00:50:24.015
come back for book number three,

1176
00:50:24.015 --> 00:50:26.244
final thoughts on The High Purpose Company

1177
00:50:26.244 --> 00:50:28.004
that you'd like to share that I haven't asked you about,

1178
00:50:28.004 --> 00:50:30.820
and then after that, I'd like to just do a little thumbnail

1179
00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:35.139
look at, say, the top five and then maybe the next five

1180
00:50:35.139 --> 00:50:37.593
that you'd be surprised at that are positioned to,

1181
00:50:37.593 --> 00:50:40.632
perhaps, move into high purpose that might surprise us.

1182
00:50:40.632 --> 00:50:42.862
So first of all, the overview.

1183
00:50:42.862 --> 00:50:45.837
<v ->The overview is that I believe that the way</v>

1184
00:50:45.837 --> 00:50:48.163
the socially responsible investment industry

1185
00:50:48.163 --> 00:50:51.266
and the CSR industry rates corporate responsibility

1186
00:50:51.266 --> 00:50:55.405
really needs to be reassessed 'cause it's not about,

1187
00:50:55.405 --> 00:50:57.165
who's the best citizen?

1188
00:50:57.165 --> 00:50:59.277
Is Green Mountain Coffee Roaster a company

1189
00:50:59.277 --> 00:51:02.615
that has won Best Citizen, number one by business ethics,

1190
00:51:02.615 --> 00:51:05.710
the last two years, is that really a better citizen

1191
00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:08.547
than, say, Dean's Beans, which is 100% organic fair trade

1192
00:51:08.547 --> 00:51:10.915
or any number of other companies?

1193
00:51:10.915 --> 00:51:14.349
I think these subjective determinations are

1194
00:51:15.729 --> 00:51:19.160
misleading, and they don't really help promote progress.

1195
00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:22.253
I don't think that it's just like the SRI industry,

1196
00:51:22.253 --> 00:51:25.644
with NFS's list of 100 of the most sustainable companies.

1197
00:51:27.274 --> 00:51:30.231
Are BP and Coca Cola truly two of the most

1198
00:51:30.231 --> 00:51:31.500
sustainable companies?

1199
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:34.849
Again, no, it's a misnomer, so it causes confusion,

1200
00:51:34.849 --> 00:51:36.588
and people question the standards.

1201
00:51:36.588 --> 00:51:39.660
I think everyone listening needs to focus on one thing

1202
00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:41.163
and one thing only, and that is,

1203
00:51:41.163 --> 00:51:45.387
what is the value, not values with an s,

1204
00:51:45.387 --> 00:51:48.064
who cares about the values you say you stand for?

1205
00:51:48.064 --> 00:51:51.808
What value are these companies really producing?

1206
00:51:51.808 --> 00:51:54.133
Look at that value, it's tangible.

1207
00:51:54.133 --> 00:51:57.610
In all cases, it's tangible and it's measurable.

1208
00:51:57.610 --> 00:51:58.773
That's what's important.

1209
00:51:58.773 --> 00:52:00.490
It's about making a difference.

1210
00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:03.978
It's not about the talk, it's not about these lists,

1211
00:52:03.978 --> 00:52:07.338
it's about, really, who out there is the most valuable,

1212
00:52:07.338 --> 00:52:08.938
producing the most value?

1213
00:52:08.938 --> 00:52:11.871
When people, when investors and consumers

1214
00:52:11.871 --> 00:52:13.983
start to look at companies and reassess companies

1215
00:52:13.983 --> 00:52:17.887
that way, and my book explains how to do that,

1216
00:52:17.887 --> 00:52:21.129
then you start to see a totally different picture

1217
00:52:21.129 --> 00:52:24.339
materialize 'cause you realize it's about the behavior.

1218
00:52:24.789 --> 00:52:28.900
It's not about collective, you realize

1219
00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:31.150
that by going deep in one area for instance

1220
00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:32.505
where a company knows it can make the biggest

1221
00:52:32.505 --> 00:52:35.150
difference, it can actually produce a better result

1222
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:37.539
than if it tries to take on everything at once.

1223
00:52:37.539 --> 00:52:41.347
These truths start to form and people, I think,

1224
00:52:41.347 --> 00:52:42.898
can make better decisions.

1225
00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:46.210
<v ->What about the companies that you give big thumbs up to</v>

1226
00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:48.418
that we may not have already mentioned?

1227
00:52:48.418 --> 00:52:52.013
<v ->Well, I love some small retail companies</v>

1228
00:52:52.013 --> 00:52:53.666
like Eileen Fisher.

1229
00:52:53.666 --> 00:52:55.245
They're fantastic.

1230
00:52:55.245 --> 00:52:58.306
It's a really interesting phenomenon the way they even run

1231
00:52:58.306 --> 00:52:59.308
their company.

1232
00:52:59.308 --> 00:53:01.740
<v ->They tell you, "Don't throw away last season's clothing."</v>

1233
00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:02.700
<v ->They do.</v>

1234
00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:03.767
<v ->Now that's a novel approach.</v>

1235
00:53:03.767 --> 00:53:05.783
<v ->That is so contrary to the fashion industry</v>

1236
00:53:05.783 --> 00:53:08.801
to say, "We don't want you to just use something for

1237
00:53:08.801 --> 00:53:11.073
"one season, how ridiculous."

1238
00:53:11.073 --> 00:53:13.633
They're taking that counterintuitive approach,

1239
00:53:13.633 --> 00:53:16.065
but they're also a purpose-driven company.

1240
00:53:16.065 --> 00:53:19.062
They are a company that, for instance,

1241
00:53:19.062 --> 00:53:22.155
they decided they didn't want to be about hierarchy

1242
00:53:22.155 --> 00:53:25.658
so they are now led by a collective of 14 people.

1243
00:53:26.197 --> 00:53:29.098
Even in terms of the way the company is shaping

1244
00:53:29.098 --> 00:53:32.042
itself, there are real significant changes there.

1245
00:53:32.042 --> 00:53:33.642
That's one to look into.

1246
00:53:33.642 --> 00:53:35.893
There are dozens more, jeez.

1247
00:53:35.893 --> 00:53:37.471
<v ->We've talked about Wainwright.</v>

1248
00:53:37.471 --> 00:53:39.562
Maybe a couple others of your favorites.

1249
00:53:39.562 --> 00:53:43.839
<v ->I think my favorite examples are the contentious ones,</v>

1250
00:53:43.839 --> 00:53:45.791
are the ones that people wouldn't really think about.

1251
00:53:45.791 --> 00:53:49.364
I like talking about Wal-Mart because I could talk

1252
00:53:49.364 --> 00:53:52.126
for hours about Wal-Mart, the good, the bad, the ugly,

1253
00:53:52.126 --> 00:53:54.590
but really what the net impact of that is.

1254
00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:57.395
I like talking about DuPont, a huge chemical company.

1255
00:53:57.395 --> 00:53:59.433
<v ->Right, but we didn't get around to that one, actually.</v>

1256
00:53:59.433 --> 00:54:01.163
<v ->Not a crunchy granola bar company.</v>

1257
00:54:01.163 --> 00:54:03.171
<v ->Go ahead and talk just a little bit there on DuPont.</v>

1258
00:54:03.171 --> 00:54:07.051
<v ->By 2010, DuPont hopes to get 25%,</v>

1259
00:54:07.051 --> 00:54:11.274
derive 25% of its revenue through what it's calling,

1260
00:54:11.274 --> 00:54:14.037
"sustainable solutions" that are essential to a better,

1261
00:54:14.037 --> 00:54:16.537
safer, healthier life for people everywhere.

1262
00:54:17.055 --> 00:54:19.386
That sounds like a mouthful, but everything

1263
00:54:19.386 --> 00:54:22.426
from the scientific advancements DuPont's scientists

1264
00:54:22.426 --> 00:54:24.954
are making, the breakthroughs they're having,

1265
00:54:24.954 --> 00:54:28.719
to the way the company's investing in biofuels and so forth,

1266
00:54:28.719 --> 00:54:32.687
that's the way the company's resources are being allocated,

1267
00:54:32.687 --> 00:54:35.865
and that's where the company's, a degree of its growth

1268
00:54:35.865 --> 00:54:37.000
is coming from.

1269
00:54:37.625 --> 00:54:40.152
That's why Charles Holliday says, and Jeffrey Immelt

1270
00:54:40.152 --> 00:54:42.040
from GE, they'll both say,

1271
00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:45.891
"We're not investing in green because it's moral,

1272
00:54:45.891 --> 00:54:49.794
"because it's trendy, but because it's the right thing

1273
00:54:49.794 --> 00:54:51.213
"for our shareholders."

1274
00:54:51.213 --> 00:54:53.560
I'm telling you, it's that capitalist thread,

1275
00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:56.087
as much as your listeners might hate to hear this,

1276
00:54:56.087 --> 00:54:57.847
that's what's going to move the needle.

1277
00:54:57.847 --> 00:54:59.757
<v ->If that's what drives it, that's what matters.</v>

1278
00:54:59.757 --> 00:55:01.356
<v ->It certainly does.</v>

1279
00:55:01.356 --> 00:55:02.498
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1280
00:55:02.498 --> 00:55:04.119
<v ->It has so far, at least.</v>

1281
00:55:04.119 --> 00:55:07.116
<v ->What about some other companies that are poised,</v>

1282
00:55:07.116 --> 00:55:08.887
they haven't really made the full commitment

1283
00:55:08.887 --> 00:55:10.679
but you're going to be watching?

1284
00:55:10.679 --> 00:55:12.972
<v ->I'm definitely going to be watching Starbucks.</v>

1285
00:55:12.972 --> 00:55:14.966
Everyone complains about Starbucks.

1286
00:55:14.966 --> 00:55:17.729
Everybody says they don't source enough fair trade

1287
00:55:17.729 --> 00:55:19.798
coffee, certified fair trade coffee,

1288
00:55:19.798 --> 00:55:21.099
and their standards aren't--

1289
00:55:21.099 --> 00:55:22.144
<v ->Or organics.</v>

1290
00:55:22.144 --> 00:55:23.232
<v Catherine>Right.</v>
<v ->Right.</v>

1291
00:55:23.232 --> 00:55:26.070
<v ->But if you look at their cafe model, which they source</v>

1292
00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:30.549
116 some odd million pounds of coffee through every year

1293
00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:33.568
and how those standards are improving every year.

1294
00:55:33.568 --> 00:55:37.002
It's amazing, actually.

1295
00:55:37.002 --> 00:55:38.815
They're making a tremendous difference

1296
00:55:38.815 --> 00:55:43.412
even though they're not perceived as, by some groups,

1297
00:55:43.412 --> 00:55:48.169
as being one of those great, totally responsible companies,

1298
00:55:48.169 --> 00:55:51.540
but they are very, I believe, very responsive,

1299
00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:53.673
and I think that they're only going to get better.

1300
00:55:53.673 --> 00:55:54.676
<v ->Anyone else?</v>

1301
00:55:54.676 --> 00:55:55.924
<v ->I would look at Nike.</v>

1302
00:55:55.924 --> 00:55:59.155
Again, getting very close to crossing that threshold.

1303
00:55:59.155 --> 00:56:03.955
I would even look closely at Bill Ford Jr. left Ford

1304
00:56:03.955 --> 00:56:07.518
but his epiphanies in the company before he left,

1305
00:56:07.518 --> 00:56:11.411
I'll be really interested to see if they stay,

1306
00:56:11.411 --> 00:56:13.715
if they have staying power and if new management

1307
00:56:13.715 --> 00:56:16.594
actually continues with his vision.

1308
00:56:16.594 --> 00:56:18.376
I think that's a company to watch as well.

1309
00:56:18.376 --> 00:56:21.650
<v ->The Gap has made some real end roads to basically</v>

1310
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:23.762
bridging the gap between where they were before.

1311
00:56:23.762 --> 00:56:27.090
<v ->They have, they've stayed on top of the labor issues.</v>

1312
00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:30.332
They have led the industry in terms of that,

1313
00:56:30.332 --> 00:56:32.817
in terms of, again, that level of transparency,

1314
00:56:32.817 --> 00:56:35.121
letting people know how clothes are made and

1315
00:56:35.121 --> 00:56:37.809
where they source, where they get their clothes from.

1316
00:56:37.809 --> 00:56:41.254
There are dozens and dozens of companies to watch,

1317
00:56:41.254 --> 00:56:42.619
and that's the whole idea.

1318
00:56:42.619 --> 00:56:45.382
It's this progression, it's not good, bad, black, white.

1319
00:56:45.382 --> 00:56:48.976
Responsibility is a process, just like evolution,

1320
00:56:48.976 --> 00:56:51.238
just like anything evolves.

1321
00:56:51.238 --> 00:56:52.645
<v ->Beautiful work.</v>

1322
00:56:52.645 --> 00:56:53.296
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1323
00:56:53.296 --> 00:56:54.907
<v ->Can't wait to see book number three,</v>

1324
00:56:54.907 --> 00:56:56.133
and thank you so much for your time.

1325
00:56:56.133 --> 00:56:57.333
<v ->Thank you for having me.</v>

1326
00:56:58.778 --> 00:57:00.261
<v ->For more background on Christine's work,</v>

1327
00:57:00.261 --> 00:57:02.213
take a look at our first interview with her.

1328
00:57:02.213 --> 00:57:03.845
Meanwhile, I recommend you pick up a copy

1329
00:57:03.845 --> 00:57:05.743
of her book, High Purpose Company,

1330
00:57:05.743 --> 00:57:07.514
by clicking on the link below.

1331
00:57:07.514 --> 00:57:09.946
You can bet we'll be back to visit the subject again

1332
00:57:09.946 --> 00:57:11.620
as soon as her next book is out.

1333
00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:13.907
Until next time, thanks for watching.

1334
00:57:15.055 --> 00:57:18.739
(upbeat piano music)
