1
00:00:00.448 --> 00:00:03.708
<v ->Raised as an intuitive and sensitive, becoming a doctor</v>

2
00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:06.168
was the last thing on Christine Page's mind.

3
00:00:06.168 --> 00:00:08.688
Today, with 30 years of medicine behind her,

4
00:00:08.688 --> 00:00:11.168
Christine shares her profound understanding

5
00:00:11.168 --> 00:00:13.860
of spiritual alchemy and integrative medicine

6
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.160
as only the wisest among us can.

7
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.580
She says we can no longer continue to live

8
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.060
as though our lives and bodies are isolated

9
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.600
from what goes on around us,

10
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.960
and that means everything from personal relationships

11
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.120
to the movement of the cosmos.

12
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.420
Above all, she says we must stop rejecting

13
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.130
the parts of ourselves that we don't like.

14
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.380
You do not like to be known as simply an MD

15
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.580
because you have a very rich lineage

16
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.140
from a family of psychics and healers.

17
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.080
This is a very interesting combination of traits

18
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.440
and what you've put together is just stunning.

19
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.740
Tell me a little bit about your youth

20
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.060
and being raised in this environment

21
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.940
and how you went this direction.

22
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.360
<v ->It is an unusual one, and I speak to other people.</v>

23
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.860
Not everybody went to psychic readings

24
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.620
and met with people who were channeling

25
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.760
when they were five or six or seven

26
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.700
or would talk about E.T.'s or homeopathy,

27
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.160
but my mother and father were very open to all of it.

28
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.960
My mother came from Scotland and she came from a family

29
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.180
where the women were all fey, which means

30
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.080
they were all wise women.

31
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.240
And my great grandmother was one of the women

32
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.960
who would bring in the baby and let go of the dying.

33
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.920
So she was someone who was very much honored

34
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.180
as what they would now call a social worker,

35
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.760
but in those days, she was the wise woman.

36
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.400
My grandmother was the same and my mother was the same.

37
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.020
And they all had a knowingness,

38
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.060
which meant that people would come and talk to them

39
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.000
at the breakfast table to find out

40
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.140
what they thought about a situation.

41
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.360
<v Regina>You must have learned about yourself,</v>

42
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.660
though even from a very young age.

43
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.980
Can you weave a bit of that in as well?

44
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.480
<v ->I will.</v>

45
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.520
I wanted to say that that was part of it,

46
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.280
and then as a child, as a baby,

47
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.600
I can never ever not remember being

48
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.360
connected to another world.

49
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.440
And as I would lie down in my cot,

50
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.520
and as young as that, I can remember spiraling out

51
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.440
and going to another place and knowing this was really good.

52
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.080
And my mother, fortunately, I said this is what's happening,

53
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.320
when I could speak, and she said,

54
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.020
well if it works for you, do it.

55
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.180
And never ever told me not to.

56
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.220
<v Regina>That's key.</v>

57
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.180
<v ->So this was very important.</v>

58
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.760
Her friends were healers, and healing in Britain

59
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.320
was always about a donation.

60
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.460
It was a very honored situation, as was being psychic.

61
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.200
It was an honorable situation where you had to not,

62
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.780
it wasn't a party game.

63
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.620
And so I saw being intuitive or being a healer

64
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.140
as something you were given this gift.

65
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.760
And that when you met someone who did it,

66
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.720
you honored the gift of what they were carrying.

67
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.360
But for me, I had another problem

68
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.120
which was because I could see everybody,

69
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.960
and I could see them in layers, is what I not describe,

70
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.600
I always felt their suffering.

71
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.800
I didn't know how to deal with their suffering.

72
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.160
What I would do is faint, and as I went on in my years,

73
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.740
I couldn't bear when people would describe something

74
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.920
because I felt it and I would faint.

75
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.800
So crazily, when I was 11, instead of going

76
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.960
into the Girl Guides, I went into what's called the

77
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.940
Saint John's Ambulance, which is a first aid organization,

78
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.940
and prayed for seven years that nobody

79
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.000
would ever be ill on my watch.

80
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.780
Because I would faint.

81
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.840
<v Regina>Why did you choose that?</v>

82
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.340
<v ->You know, the universe was very kind.</v>

83
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.940
People usually came in before or after,

84
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.520
but I was fortunate.

85
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.360
And then crazy more, that when we make our decision

86
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.280
in England to what career, at the age of 16,

87
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.780
I said hmm where shall I go that they don't suffer?

88
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.880
I'll become a doctor.

89
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.960
I mean it was just crazy work,

90
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.340
but now I see why I became a doctor.

91
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.500
But when I went into medical school, people would say

92
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.080
wow, what about the dead bodies, the anatomy?

93
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.320
I'd say they're no problem.

94
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.660
They're not suffering, they're dead.

95
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.920
My biggest issue was the ones who were in pain.

96
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.320
So for several years as a doctor,

97
00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.940
and I did all forms of medicine.

98
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.180
I had pediatrics, obstetrics, surgery, physician,

99
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.720
we do that in England, all those roles,

100
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.280
I had to learn how to put a white coat on,

101
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.560
a stethoscope, and separate myself,

102
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.220
especially when I did ER, casualty work,

103
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.120
where truly that was one of my greatest challenges

104
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.480
to not take on somebody else's pain.

105
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.140
But it was the greatest training because

106
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.600
now people will say to me you seem to be able

107
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.620
to be detached and that detachment came

108
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.340
not from not caring, but from a place that when I attach

109
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.300
to your problem, I'm taking away some

110
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.120
of the healing I'm giving you.

111
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.900
<v Regina>So once you realized it was</v>

112
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.400
necessary for you to detach to be able to go about your job,

113
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.640
did you detach completely or were you still able

114
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.360
to see the layers?

115
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.880
<v ->Well what happened was there was a point</v>

116
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.040
where I didn't give a damn about anything.

117
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.920
I went okay you're ill, and I knew I had a problem then,

118
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.460
because I detached too far.

119
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.880
<v Regina>Okay, there's a sign.</v>

120
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.840
<v ->You need to come back again.</v>

121
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.020
(laughter)

122
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.340
And by now, I was working in general practice,

123
00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.680
and my general practice, now I look back,

124
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.420
this was in the mid-80's.

125
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.640
We had reflexology, meditation, yoga, tai chi.

126
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.760
We were teaching 50 people a day,

127
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.500
or I should say a week, to learn about

128
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.960
these complementary medicines.

129
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.880
The things that we're learning here,

130
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.200
we were teaching 20 years ago.

131
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.620
I was fortunate if you want to say that.

132
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.180
I was with wonderful partners in a

133
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.600
national health service practice, who said

134
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.680
anything you want to teach, there's a room for it.

135
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.460
Go for it.

136
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.640
<v Regina>So complementary medicine</v>

137
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.320
has been embraced for quite a long time?

138
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.880
<v ->It has, but we were quite unique to integrate it</v>

139
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.600
and actually get clients in to see other practitioners

140
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.640
apart from ourselves because there's still

141
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.980
some sort of jealousies, some sort of patronization

142
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.620
that says they're for us, not for others.

143
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.140
And although alternative complementary medicine

144
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.300
is very much part of the British system,

145
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.100
we have five homeopathic hospitals within

146
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.720
the national health service.

147
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.460
We have acupuncture, reflexology,

148
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.520
but the fact of the matter is there is still,

149
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.720
unfortunately, where no money is being earned from it,

150
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.920
there is less interest.

151
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.000
<v Regina>Sure.</v>

152
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.020
<v ->There is however, a ground swell,</v>

153
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.400
which is far greater than here,

154
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.280
where most people in Britain will know

155
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.980
and will use complementary medicine

156
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.300
whether or not it's arnica for their bruises

157
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.180
or lavender for their burns, there's a knowingness.

158
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.520
I did a study in the 80's where I found that

159
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.620
up to 40% of our patients were already

160
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.180
visiting complementary practitioners.

161
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.740
<v Regina>40% in the 80's?</v>

162
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.860
Well I did do some stories in England in the 80's.

163
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.240
I did some interviews with people,

164
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.120
Patricia Davis on the subject of aromatherapy

165
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.900
and some others, Vicky Wall.

166
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.620
<v ->Yes yes.</v>

167
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.760
<v Regina>And I was very impressed</v>

168
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.920
at that time because this was not really heard of in the US,

169
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.020
except in very rare circles.

170
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.180
So thank God it's starting to come around here too now,

171
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.980
but you are so far ahead of the game,

172
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.340
and you've taken it far deeper.

173
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.620
<v ->I have because at the about 1987,</v>

174
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.900
I didn't really know about the harmonic convergence,

175
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.900
I was thinking about this, but in 1987, I knew that 80%

176
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.960
of my patients I was seeing keep taking the tablets.

177
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.580
I wasn't getting them well.

178
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.800
I had them on treatment.

179
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.680
And to me, I went into medicine to get people off treatment.

180
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.160
I do not believe someone's well while they're taking drugs.

181
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.700
<v Regina>You would not make a good</v>

182
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.660
pharmaceutical representative.

183
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.160
<v ->I would not, I would not.</v>

184
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.260
And truly, most of my clients or patients knew what to do.

185
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.520
They had all the complementary medicine at home,

186
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.060
and of course I was a good doctor,

187
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.380
in the sense that if I knew they needed medicines,

188
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.938
I'd give them, certainly.

189
00:07:29.938 --> 00:07:32.418
But most of the first aid things, they did.

190
00:07:32.418 --> 00:07:33.418
They knew what to do.

191
00:07:33.418 --> 00:07:35.518
They didn't run to a doctor for an antibiotic

192
00:07:35.518 --> 00:07:36.938
when they got a cold.

193
00:07:36.938 --> 00:07:39.658
They looked after themselves to the level

194
00:07:39.658 --> 00:07:41.538
that they could take care and then they would

195
00:07:41.538 --> 00:07:43.938
seek help when it wasn't getting better.

196
00:07:43.938 --> 00:07:47.998
So I decided that if 80% were on drugs, however,

197
00:07:47.998 --> 00:07:50.858
that was not enough, so I then took on

198
00:07:50.858 --> 00:07:51.918
a homeopathic practice.

199
00:07:51.918 --> 00:07:53.518
I'm a classic homeopath,

200
00:07:53.518 --> 00:07:56.658
and I got 50% of those people off their drugs.

201
00:07:56.658 --> 00:07:57.838
Now to me, that's success.

202
00:07:57.838 --> 00:07:58.858
<v Regina>That's success.</v>

203
00:07:58.858 --> 00:08:00.998
<v ->And I gave them, obviously, nutrition advice</v>

204
00:08:00.998 --> 00:08:03.518
and psychological advice which I feel

205
00:08:03.518 --> 00:08:05.338
is very much part of it because

206
00:08:05.338 --> 00:08:07.198
homeopathy always looks at the whole person,

207
00:08:07.198 --> 00:08:08.678
the mentals as we call them.

208
00:08:08.678 --> 00:08:10.578
What's going on in the mind?

209
00:08:10.578 --> 00:08:13.078
And so homeopathy helped, but then I thought,

210
00:08:13.078 --> 00:08:14.938
well they're still dependent on me.

211
00:08:14.938 --> 00:08:16.098
They're still coming to me.

212
00:08:16.098 --> 00:08:17.998
I'm not giving them the chance,

213
00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:20.938
so we started talking about mind, body in medicine,

214
00:08:20.938 --> 00:08:24.818
and then I knew I had to teach them intuition.

215
00:08:24.818 --> 00:08:27.118
So probably for the last 12, 15 years,

216
00:08:27.118 --> 00:08:29.798
I've been teaching people intuition.

217
00:08:29.798 --> 00:08:32.218
For four years, I had a training for

218
00:08:32.218 --> 00:08:35.478
just doctors and psychologists here in the states,

219
00:08:35.478 --> 00:08:39.378
really helping them to listen in to what was going on.

220
00:08:39.378 --> 00:08:41.798
Because I would like to be not needed.

221
00:08:41.798 --> 00:08:45.058
<v Regina>That's the sign of a really good healer.</v>

222
00:08:45.058 --> 00:08:46.978
<v ->Yes, I don't want to be needed.</v>

223
00:08:46.978 --> 00:08:48.978
I want to be redundant.

224
00:08:48.978 --> 00:08:50.888
I do know we need mirrors, and we all need that.

225
00:08:50.888 --> 00:08:53.578
We need to be able to say hey I can't quite see myself

226
00:08:53.578 --> 00:08:55.998
or I've got this and I can't see,

227
00:08:55.998 --> 00:08:57.318
could someone give me a mirror?

228
00:08:57.318 --> 00:08:58.438
But that could be your husband.

229
00:08:58.438 --> 00:08:59.118
It could be your wife.

230
00:08:59.118 --> 00:09:00.618
It could be your two-year-old.

231
00:09:00.618 --> 00:09:03.138
That's exactly what I think we need.

232
00:09:03.138 --> 00:09:04.858
<v Regina>Well and as I was listening</v>

233
00:09:04.858 --> 00:09:07.778
to you speak yesterday, fairly early on,

234
00:09:07.778 --> 00:09:10.858
you had a sentence up there on your powerpoint

235
00:09:10.858 --> 00:09:13.118
that everybody started laughing at, and it said,

236
00:09:13.118 --> 00:09:15.038
what you don't accept, you will marry.

237
00:09:15.038 --> 00:09:16.838
(laughter)

238
00:09:16.838 --> 00:09:19.798
It was a kind of wicked laugh among those in the audience,

239
00:09:19.798 --> 00:09:23.198
and essentially suggesting that we should embrace opposites.

240
00:09:23.198 --> 00:09:28.098
Now at what point in the story, the personal history

241
00:09:28.098 --> 00:09:31.478
of each individual, does this part start coming in?

242
00:09:31.478 --> 00:09:34.198
To the profile of health, mental, physical, and emotional.

243
00:09:34.198 --> 00:09:37.138
<v ->Absolutely, so this usually comes in when you've</v>

244
00:09:37.138 --> 00:09:38.996
reached a stage of self-development where

245
00:09:38.996 --> 00:09:41.356
you are no longer the tribe, as such.

246
00:09:41.356 --> 00:09:42.396
You're feeling quite good.

247
00:09:42.396 --> 00:09:44.676
You're starting to listen to your own insights,

248
00:09:44.676 --> 00:09:47.656
and then you meet these people who you don't like,

249
00:09:47.656 --> 00:09:49.599
and you feel powerful enough in yourself

250
00:09:49.599 --> 00:09:51.159
that you can point fingers and say,

251
00:09:51.159 --> 00:09:53.499
well I'm glad I'm not them, and I'm not like them.

252
00:09:53.499 --> 00:09:55.759
And then you start to look at your family and you go

253
00:09:55.759 --> 00:09:58.239
I can just separate from them.

254
00:09:58.239 --> 00:10:01.899
And what I say is no, they are part of you.

255
00:10:01.899 --> 00:10:04.999
And so what we judge is usually what we fear becoming.

256
00:10:04.999 --> 00:10:09.799
And the easiest ones are your family and our loved ones,

257
00:10:09.799 --> 00:10:12.659
and the list that could go on.

258
00:10:12.659 --> 00:10:15.639
But as I said, if I can give a simple example of myself,

259
00:10:15.639 --> 00:10:18.759
which is my rescuer, my responsible part,

260
00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:21.459
and being so responsible, it's part of my make-up.

261
00:10:21.459 --> 00:10:23.779
I feel that I'll rescue everybody.

262
00:10:23.779 --> 00:10:26.319
I'm always the one that's there for other people.

263
00:10:26.319 --> 00:10:29.019
And I keep attracting these irresponsible people,

264
00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:30.339
which is so annoying.

265
00:10:30.339 --> 00:10:31.699
Well I did.

266
00:10:31.699 --> 00:10:35.019
And in that, I would then try to change them

267
00:10:35.019 --> 00:10:37.639
to become more responsible, instead of recognizing

268
00:10:37.639 --> 00:10:39.839
that they had something to give me.

269
00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:42.099
And I take it, and another example would be

270
00:10:42.099 --> 00:10:43.899
the sort of person who's a workaholic,

271
00:10:43.899 --> 00:10:46.119
who may get up at six to start their emails,

272
00:10:46.119 --> 00:10:47.719
by nine, they've done all their emails,

273
00:10:47.719 --> 00:10:50.559
and the person walks into the office

274
00:10:50.559 --> 00:10:53.019
and they come in with their Starbucks and sit down.

275
00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:56.379
They don't do emails until they finish the Starbucks,

276
00:10:56.379 --> 00:10:59.279
and then they go on and they make sure they go to lunch,

277
00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:00.819
and at five o'clock, they go,

278
00:11:00.819 --> 00:11:02.919
and you're still in the office working wild,

279
00:11:02.919 --> 00:11:04.519
and you're so angry at this person,

280
00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:07.339
that this person knows something you don't.

281
00:11:07.339 --> 00:11:10.539
And this person has something that would help you,

282
00:11:10.539 --> 00:11:13.519
which is the ability to know what their needs are, maybe.

283
00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:16.119
Now you may not want to become exactly like them,

284
00:11:16.119 --> 00:11:19.299
but there's something in them you'd like to be like.

285
00:11:19.299 --> 00:11:20.999
They'll be the one that says well actually,

286
00:11:20.999 --> 00:11:22.979
I don't feel well, I'm going to take a day off.

287
00:11:22.979 --> 00:11:24.379
Now that may irritate you because

288
00:11:24.379 --> 00:11:26.319
you've never taken a day off in your life,

289
00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:28.239
but there may be a part of you that says

290
00:11:28.239 --> 00:11:30.839
actually I would like to be able to do that,

291
00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:32.779
to not feel so responsible.

292
00:11:32.779 --> 00:11:34.099
<v Regina>And this seems to be reflected</v>

293
00:11:34.099 --> 00:11:37.459
in almost anything that we have a very strong preference

294
00:11:37.459 --> 00:11:38.579
or lack of preference for.

295
00:11:38.579 --> 00:11:41.639
<v ->Exactly, exactly, so I will speak of someone</v>

296
00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:44.579
who was a healer, and this is very common

297
00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:46.079
amongst healers and therapists,

298
00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:48.439
who actually didn't have high opinions

299
00:11:48.439 --> 00:11:50.339
of people who were needy.

300
00:11:50.339 --> 00:11:52.899
And part of her experience was

301
00:11:52.899 --> 00:11:55.639
if she could just make them less needy,

302
00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:57.599
it wouldn't irritate her so much.

303
00:11:57.599 --> 00:12:01.379
So her fixing, she felt a need to fix them.

304
00:12:01.379 --> 00:12:03.559
And when we spoke about it, and I said,

305
00:12:03.559 --> 00:12:05.619
well what if she became ill, and she said,

306
00:12:05.619 --> 00:12:07.099
I'd rather die.

307
00:12:07.099 --> 00:12:11.199
And it was so strong, and yet she spent

308
00:12:11.199 --> 00:12:15.159
so many years as a healer and it felt

309
00:12:15.159 --> 00:12:17.119
that here you are trying to help people,

310
00:12:17.119 --> 00:12:19.039
but if it really was a reflection,

311
00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:22.139
you were really saying I think you might as well just die.

312
00:12:22.139 --> 00:12:23.659
<v Regina>Right, right.</v>

313
00:12:23.659 --> 00:12:27.139
<v ->So her healing ability to help others was limited</v>

314
00:12:27.139 --> 00:12:30.399
by her own ability to help herself.

315
00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:32.219
And that happens to all of us as therapists.

316
00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:33.799
You go in, you're very excited.

317
00:12:33.799 --> 00:12:36.839
You help people, and then you reach a plateau,

318
00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:38.539
and you start getting burnt out

319
00:12:38.539 --> 00:12:42.099
because you can't go further than you've gone yourself.

320
00:12:42.099 --> 00:12:43.919
And that's true of any line of work.

321
00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:45.679
When are you lacking the excitement,

322
00:12:45.679 --> 00:12:48.699
is usually when you reach a wall,

323
00:12:48.699 --> 00:12:50.579
and it's within yourself to go further.

324
00:12:50.579 --> 00:12:52.699
<v Regina>Is that wall this very thing</v>

325
00:12:52.699 --> 00:12:54.559
you're talking about, is this when we

326
00:12:54.559 --> 00:12:57.059
perhaps start attracting more of that

327
00:12:57.059 --> 00:12:57.999
which we resist into our lives?

328
00:12:57.999 --> 00:13:01.039
<v ->Unfortunately, the universe is very generous.</v>

329
00:13:01.039 --> 00:13:03.079
It says, well I'll send them not only monthly,

330
00:13:03.079 --> 00:13:05.939
but weekly, daily, minutes.

331
00:13:05.939 --> 00:13:07.099
(laughter)

332
00:13:07.099 --> 00:13:08.419
<v Regina>Well if you're a doctor, every seven minutes</v>

333
00:13:08.419 --> 00:13:10.459
<v ->Every seven minutes, absolutely.</v>

334
00:13:10.459 --> 00:13:11.219
And it will happen.

335
00:13:11.219 --> 00:13:12.879
And think in an office setting,

336
00:13:12.879 --> 00:13:15.279
you may be looking at someone who's a pushy,

337
00:13:15.279 --> 00:13:17.119
and gets the job they wanted, and you say,

338
00:13:17.119 --> 00:13:18.259
I'll never be like that,

339
00:13:18.259 --> 00:13:20.159
but you reach the level where until you

340
00:13:20.159 --> 00:13:23.259
take on some of that, you cannot go further.

341
00:13:23.259 --> 00:13:24.499
<v Regina>This is an uncomfortable subject</v>

342
00:13:24.499 --> 00:13:26.139
for an awful lot of people because

343
00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:27.979
we've been trained to be polite

344
00:13:27.979 --> 00:13:30.739
and to be nice and in the case of most women,

345
00:13:30.739 --> 00:13:33.639
certainly good girls, good women.

346
00:13:33.639 --> 00:13:37.479
And as you said, being simply nice and good

347
00:13:37.479 --> 00:13:39.239
is not enough.

348
00:13:39.239 --> 00:13:43.179
Can you explain the journey of authenticity?

349
00:13:43.179 --> 00:13:46.259
<v ->I will, and I will speak of breast cancer.</v>

350
00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:50.159
I mean my experience is now 30 years of being an MD,

351
00:13:50.159 --> 00:13:54.059
and I saw 40 patients a day for that length of time,

352
00:13:54.059 --> 00:13:56.659
and perhaps less, but I've traveled the world,

353
00:13:56.659 --> 00:13:59.159
and what I've said, the illness doesn't change

354
00:13:59.159 --> 00:14:01.139
depending on what country I am in,

355
00:14:01.139 --> 00:14:03.139
or let's say the personality behind the illness.

356
00:14:03.139 --> 00:14:05.039
The illnesses will change, I have to say.

357
00:14:05.039 --> 00:14:07.679
You meet different illnesses depending on the culture,

358
00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:10.379
but if you see breast cancer in any country,

359
00:14:10.379 --> 00:14:12.439
it's the same type of personality,

360
00:14:12.439 --> 00:14:16.339
and that is someone who gives all their love,

361
00:14:16.339 --> 00:14:19.219
all their milk, all their food to the family

362
00:14:19.219 --> 00:14:21.959
in a desire to get something back.

363
00:14:21.959 --> 00:14:24.539
And it's never going to come back

364
00:14:24.539 --> 00:14:27.439
because if you're doing from a place of expectation,

365
00:14:27.439 --> 00:14:29.719
you're always going to be disappointed.

366
00:14:29.719 --> 00:14:33.319
So what happens is eventually you build up a resentment.

367
00:14:33.319 --> 00:14:35.679
<v Regina>That's the classic martyr scenario.</v>

368
00:14:35.679 --> 00:14:36.879
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

369
00:14:36.879 --> 00:14:38.079
And we all do it, whether or not...

370
00:14:38.079 --> 00:14:40.239
But breast cancer is specific, and

371
00:14:40.239 --> 00:14:41.079
that's why I wanted to speak...

372
00:14:41.079 --> 00:14:42.479
<v Regina>And women tend to do this a lot anyway.</v>

373
00:14:42.479 --> 00:14:43.739
<v ->Yes, and the resentment builds up,</v>

374
00:14:43.739 --> 00:14:46.659
and you say what I'd do is I'll put more in.

375
00:14:46.659 --> 00:14:49.299
I'll try harder, I'll please them more,

376
00:14:49.299 --> 00:14:52.319
and of course, if you've ever been around a pleaser,

377
00:14:52.319 --> 00:14:54.179
they actually start to irritate.

378
00:14:54.179 --> 00:14:56.319
So inevitably, they push people away

379
00:14:56.319 --> 00:14:58.359
rather than bringing them in because

380
00:14:58.359 --> 00:14:59.379
they don't use their voice and say

381
00:14:59.379 --> 00:15:01.099
could you just appreciate me

382
00:15:01.099 --> 00:15:02.519
because they're too nice.

383
00:15:02.519 --> 00:15:04.739
And eventually the breast cancer comes.

384
00:15:04.739 --> 00:15:05.899
<v Regina>This is a good point.</v>

385
00:15:05.899 --> 00:15:08.859
There's one woman I've known throughout my life

386
00:15:08.859 --> 00:15:10.819
since we were both teenagers and

387
00:15:10.819 --> 00:15:14.359
I've always had an interest in her

388
00:15:14.359 --> 00:15:16.639
and admired what she's done.

389
00:15:16.639 --> 00:15:18.879
In essence, she married a lawyer.

390
00:15:18.879 --> 00:15:21.699
She did not choose to work, in that sense.

391
00:15:21.699 --> 00:15:24.339
She had three children, and chose to be a stay-at-home mom,

392
00:15:24.339 --> 00:15:26.619
and this was not the popular thing to do.

393
00:15:26.619 --> 00:15:31.239
But along that journey, she was very clear.

394
00:15:31.239 --> 00:15:33.739
No, I don't do that.

395
00:15:33.739 --> 00:15:35.639
You take responsibility for this.

396
00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:37.339
No, this is my time.

397
00:15:37.339 --> 00:15:39.539
And she was a wonderful mother.

398
00:15:39.539 --> 00:15:41.419
She was a wonderful wife, but

399
00:15:41.419 --> 00:15:44.879
she was probably the clearest of any woman I've ever seen

400
00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:48.599
on delineating what was hers in terms of her energy,

401
00:15:48.599 --> 00:15:53.559
her time, her interests, and the children in her family,

402
00:15:53.559 --> 00:15:56.359
each grew up with a sense of personal responsibility,

403
00:15:56.359 --> 00:15:57.959
a certain amount of boundaries.

404
00:15:57.959 --> 00:15:59.779
This is not what you normally see.

405
00:15:59.779 --> 00:16:01.079
<v ->No it isn't.</v>

406
00:16:01.079 --> 00:16:04.699
It isn't at all, and my era was very much a post war era

407
00:16:04.699 --> 00:16:08.899
of child who was taught to be a good woman is

408
00:16:08.899 --> 00:16:10.919
to have the briefcase of your husband there,

409
00:16:10.919 --> 00:16:12.739
and to have the meal on the table.

410
00:16:12.739 --> 00:16:15.279
Now even though we are now modern women,

411
00:16:15.279 --> 00:16:18.139
it is my age group and around that

412
00:16:18.139 --> 00:16:21.179
who are still caught up in that's the way we were taught,

413
00:16:21.179 --> 00:16:23.179
and I wonder whether or not the youngsters

414
00:16:23.179 --> 00:16:25.399
are gonna get the same illnesses,

415
00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:28.459
but certainly I see youngsters giving themselves away,

416
00:16:28.459 --> 00:16:30.839
giving their power away to a relationship.

417
00:16:30.839 --> 00:16:31.599
<v Regina>The girls?</v>

418
00:16:31.599 --> 00:16:32.999
<v ->To love, yes especially the girls.</v>

419
00:16:32.999 --> 00:16:33.959
<v Regina>Especially the girls.</v>

420
00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:36.719
<v ->I see men doing it as well, but in different ways.</v>

421
00:16:36.719 --> 00:16:39.019
<v Regina>And there are differences.</v>

422
00:16:39.019 --> 00:16:41.479
So with the women, you see this really shows itself

423
00:16:41.479 --> 00:16:42.579
via breast cancer.

424
00:16:42.579 --> 00:16:45.459
What are some of the other classic feminine illnesses

425
00:16:45.459 --> 00:16:48.259
that you see as a result of our disowning

426
00:16:48.259 --> 00:16:51.399
portions of our true self, our authentic self?

427
00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:54.659
<v ->Fibroids, myomas, fibroids of the womb.</v>

428
00:16:54.659 --> 00:16:58.379
Fibroids are large tumors which are benign,

429
00:16:58.379 --> 00:17:01.039
they're not malignant, but when I see a woman

430
00:17:01.039 --> 00:17:03.699
who's got fibroids and many many women do,

431
00:17:03.699 --> 00:17:07.119
I will say so who takes care of you then?

432
00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:11.259
And most women go into tears because nobody.

433
00:17:11.259 --> 00:17:13.399
So they're full, their wombs are full of everybody,

434
00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:16.379
so we go in and we go okay let's get rid of the outlaws

435
00:17:16.379 --> 00:17:18.999
and the in-laws and the son who should

436
00:17:18.999 --> 00:17:21.439
be taking self-responsibility,

437
00:17:21.439 --> 00:17:23.239
and all those people I take care of because

438
00:17:23.239 --> 00:17:24.679
there's no space for me.

439
00:17:24.679 --> 00:17:27.719
So the womb, which is literally our nest,

440
00:17:27.719 --> 00:17:30.319
our place we go, where is it now?

441
00:17:30.319 --> 00:17:31.619
And I feel, in the olden days,

442
00:17:31.619 --> 00:17:33.239
you did have women in the kitchen

443
00:17:33.239 --> 00:17:35.979
and men in the outside somewhere.

444
00:17:35.979 --> 00:17:37.959
Now we don't know who we are and

445
00:17:37.959 --> 00:17:40.699
where do we find sacred space in our homes?

446
00:17:40.699 --> 00:17:43.159
We're all on top of each other and

447
00:17:43.159 --> 00:17:44.799
even though we have bigger and bigger homes,

448
00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:48.899
somehow there's not space, there's not that ideal idea

449
00:17:48.899 --> 00:17:51.579
that actually I do need space just for me

450
00:17:51.579 --> 00:17:53.219
to do the things that suit me,

451
00:17:53.219 --> 00:17:56.259
and I think part of it is women being out at work

452
00:17:56.259 --> 00:17:58.859
for that 24/7 sort of life we lead.

453
00:17:58.859 --> 00:18:01.539
But the womb is definitely like

454
00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:03.819
who is it that you need to let go of?

455
00:18:03.819 --> 00:18:06.219
And part of that is the fear of women

456
00:18:06.219 --> 00:18:08.959
and men to allow other people into their lives.

457
00:18:08.959 --> 00:18:10.699
So it's much easier to take care of others

458
00:18:10.699 --> 00:18:13.179
than to ask others to take care of me.

459
00:18:13.179 --> 00:18:15.019
<v Regina>The nurturing, the nurturing</v>

460
00:18:15.019 --> 00:18:17.979
in our modern cultures has really been left behind

461
00:18:17.979 --> 00:18:19.619
because everyone is so busy.

462
00:18:19.619 --> 00:18:24.579
<v ->Yeah, but scared, because we, in this culture especially,</v>

463
00:18:24.579 --> 00:18:27.599
there is a fear of needing others.

464
00:18:27.599 --> 00:18:30.959
We revere people who are independent heroes

465
00:18:30.959 --> 00:18:33.239
who have done it alone.

466
00:18:33.239 --> 00:18:35.119
<v Regina>Very true, that's a very good point.</v>

467
00:18:35.119 --> 00:18:38.439
<v ->And we know community's so important for health.</v>

468
00:18:38.439 --> 00:18:39.939
<v Regina>Yes, and we don't want to be seen</v>

469
00:18:39.939 --> 00:18:43.859
as needy individuals, males or females in this culture.

470
00:18:43.859 --> 00:18:45.439
<v ->That's right.</v>

471
00:18:45.439 --> 00:18:47.959
<v Regina>So now as, in fact there was something</v>

472
00:18:47.959 --> 00:18:50.239
in this I wanted to get to which is,

473
00:18:50.239 --> 00:18:54.239
when you have a portion of the development

474
00:18:54.239 --> 00:18:59.239
of the emotional psyche, that is called crowning oneself,

475
00:19:00.159 --> 00:19:01.799
you get to a certain point in development,

476
00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:03.399
now you've gone through the tribal part,

477
00:19:03.399 --> 00:19:06.699
and now can you talk about how you get to that next part?

478
00:19:06.699 --> 00:19:08.839
<v ->Yes, so as you say, you step out,</v>

479
00:19:08.839 --> 00:19:10.180
you feel good about yourself.

480
00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.939
You start taking on your power,

481
00:19:11.939 --> 00:19:16.179
and then you do this thing of having to meet your opposite.

482
00:19:16.179 --> 00:19:19.359
In that opposite is the sacred marriage of opposites.

483
00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:21.419
This was the phrase that Hyung used,

484
00:19:21.419 --> 00:19:24.279
and he said you will only reach individualization

485
00:19:24.279 --> 00:19:26.959
through sacred marriage of opposites.

486
00:19:26.959 --> 00:19:29.859
So I want to keep reminding anybody who's listening

487
00:19:29.859 --> 00:19:33.997
is that unity can only be reached through duality.

488
00:19:33.997 --> 00:19:35.617
People are trying to reach unity

489
00:19:35.617 --> 00:19:37.277
without honoring the duality,

490
00:19:37.277 --> 00:19:39.317
and that unity is a false unity.

491
00:19:39.317 --> 00:19:42.697
It is, as you asked me earlier, about I'll be good.

492
00:19:42.697 --> 00:19:46.957
Good isn't authentic, it is one-sided.

493
00:19:46.957 --> 00:19:50.137
So you cannot find that unity unless

494
00:19:50.137 --> 00:19:53.057
you embrace the duality, the two sides.

495
00:19:53.057 --> 00:19:55.557
And that means diving down, as I say,

496
00:19:55.557 --> 00:19:58.157
anybody you have emotional reactions to,

497
00:19:58.157 --> 00:19:59.957
saying where are they in me?

498
00:19:59.957 --> 00:20:02.257
How do I marry them inside myself?

499
00:20:02.257 --> 00:20:05.057
And the crowning is when you can stand

500
00:20:05.057 --> 00:20:09.777
like the Leo king, the lion, and say here I am.

501
00:20:09.777 --> 00:20:11.777
Look, I'm celebrating myself.

502
00:20:11.777 --> 00:20:13.497
I've achieved this because

503
00:20:13.497 --> 00:20:16.817
the work I've done in this country, and in others,

504
00:20:16.817 --> 00:20:20.317
people have a great fear of being seen in that role

505
00:20:20.317 --> 00:20:22.257
celebrating who they are.

506
00:20:22.257 --> 00:20:24.737
<v Regina>Oh yes, modesty, humility.</v>

507
00:20:24.737 --> 00:20:27.057
<v ->And I have to say I was amazed when I came to the states.</v>

508
00:20:27.057 --> 00:20:29.217
I thought you could do it better than we could.

509
00:20:29.217 --> 00:20:32.337
<v Regina>Quite puritanical, quite puritanical.</v>

510
00:20:32.337 --> 00:20:33.897
<v ->And so we will shoot ourselves in the foot</v>

511
00:20:33.897 --> 00:20:35.017
rather than do that.

512
00:20:35.017 --> 00:20:37.197
So we'll just be coming to the point of success

513
00:20:37.197 --> 00:20:41.637
when we go oops, and we allow ourselves to just fade away

514
00:20:41.637 --> 00:20:44.417
because we've been told nobody likes a bighead,

515
00:20:44.417 --> 00:20:47.877
think about this before you think of yourself,

516
00:20:47.877 --> 00:20:50.957
and we also knows pride comes before a fall,

517
00:20:50.957 --> 00:20:53.537
and our family and our friends may be

518
00:20:53.537 --> 00:20:55.437
just waiting for us to be successful

519
00:20:55.437 --> 00:20:58.517
because again, in many cultures, once someone's successful,

520
00:20:58.517 --> 00:21:00.417
then the next thing you do is pull them down.

521
00:21:00.417 --> 00:21:03.017
<v Regina>Right, that is so true.</v>

522
00:21:03.017 --> 00:21:05.037
<v ->So we're so bad at celebrating each other.</v>

523
00:21:05.037 --> 00:21:09.597
So I don't talk about gratitude, I talk about celebration.

524
00:21:09.597 --> 00:21:12.397
What do you celebrate and I get people in my workshops

525
00:21:12.397 --> 00:21:14.697
to stand up and say if you were to write down

526
00:21:14.697 --> 00:21:16.657
three things that your soul would celebrate,

527
00:21:16.657 --> 00:21:20.477
not the fact that you had a birthday, no,

528
00:21:20.477 --> 00:21:23.077
what are the three things your soul celebrates,

529
00:21:23.077 --> 00:21:25.977
and I've had people step up and it would be

530
00:21:25.977 --> 00:21:28.897
that I left someone, I stayed with someone,

531
00:21:28.897 --> 00:21:32.757
I had the abortion, I didn't have the abortion,

532
00:21:32.757 --> 00:21:35.797
I gave up drugs, I didn't give up drugs,

533
00:21:35.797 --> 00:21:38.598
things that it's not about judgement.

534
00:21:38.598 --> 00:21:40.497
It's about what does your soul believe

535
00:21:40.497 --> 00:21:42.717
that it's learned through that experience?

536
00:21:42.717 --> 00:21:44.537
Because once you've gained that,

537
00:21:44.537 --> 00:21:46.417
you don't necessarily need the experience,

538
00:21:46.417 --> 00:21:49.277
but many times, they've never told anybody

539
00:21:49.277 --> 00:21:50.697
about the celebration and therefore,

540
00:21:50.697 --> 00:21:52.437
they're still holding onto it.

541
00:21:52.437 --> 00:21:56.677
So when you can celebrate it, you can be ready to let it go.

542
00:21:56.677 --> 00:21:59.497
<v ->So this celebration or crowning of oneself,</v>

543
00:21:59.497 --> 00:22:03.957
I heard you say that often times, it's not the good girl,

544
00:22:03.957 --> 00:22:06.257
we're using the feminine lens for just a moment,

545
00:22:06.257 --> 00:22:09.297
it's not the good girl that's necessarily crowned,

546
00:22:09.297 --> 00:22:10.877
it might be the bitch.

547
00:22:10.877 --> 00:22:12.097
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>

548
00:22:12.097 --> 00:22:15.957
So when you embrace the bitch, knowing the good girl's there

549
00:22:15.957 --> 00:22:18.357
but that the good girl doesn't judge the bitch,

550
00:22:18.357 --> 00:22:20.617
that she can say yeah I'm both of these characters,

551
00:22:20.617 --> 00:22:23.398
and today that's what I fancy being, watch out.

552
00:22:23.398 --> 00:22:28.177
And it's like a closet that's got lots of clothes in it.

553
00:22:28.177 --> 00:22:30.698
So you have no fear of your clothes.

554
00:22:30.698 --> 00:22:32.597
You're just saying today I'm gonna wear that one,

555
00:22:32.597 --> 00:22:34.177
tomorrow I'll wear that one.

556
00:22:34.177 --> 00:22:37.637
It's when we hide our clothes or hide parts of ourselves,

557
00:22:37.637 --> 00:22:39.557
we get into troubles.

558
00:22:39.557 --> 00:22:41.897
<v Regina>And this has an effect across the board?</v>

559
00:22:41.897 --> 00:22:42.537
<v ->Yes.</v>

560
00:22:42.537 --> 00:22:43.517
<v Regina>All the way through to our</v>

561
00:22:43.517 --> 00:22:44.917
spiritual development as well.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

562
00:22:44.917 --> 00:22:46.357
<v Regina>It's not just stopping at</v>

563
00:22:46.357 --> 00:22:48.377
disharmony in the physical.

564
00:22:48.377 --> 00:22:50.877
<v ->Oh it's total because with the next stage</v>

565
00:22:50.877 --> 00:22:54.257
we're gonna get into is we have even deeper parts

566
00:22:54.257 --> 00:22:56.117
of ourselves that we don't want to go to.

567
00:22:56.117 --> 00:22:57.377
<v Regina>And I would like to to go there</v>

568
00:22:57.377 --> 00:23:00.177
and also we were looking through the feminine lens,

569
00:23:00.177 --> 00:23:02.117
but one of the things you notice in this culture

570
00:23:02.117 --> 00:23:03.437
because we don't know who we are,

571
00:23:03.437 --> 00:23:07.617
is that men have a type of repressed rage

572
00:23:07.617 --> 00:23:08.697
and can you address that?

573
00:23:08.697 --> 00:23:09.717
<v ->I can.</v>

574
00:23:09.717 --> 00:23:11.917
I'm glad I'm not a man in this life.

575
00:23:11.917 --> 00:23:15.557
I think it's tough, and I have a dear husband

576
00:23:15.557 --> 00:23:19.677
of only three years, and he certainly is,

577
00:23:19.677 --> 00:23:21.397
we're now finding we're working more with

578
00:23:21.397 --> 00:23:23.217
the men and the women separately

579
00:23:23.217 --> 00:23:25.497
so that the men can express what they feel

580
00:23:25.497 --> 00:23:26.857
away from women because I don't think

581
00:23:26.857 --> 00:23:28.497
it's so easy for men to do that.

582
00:23:28.497 --> 00:23:30.237
I mean, we know there are men's groups,

583
00:23:30.237 --> 00:23:32.597
but there were some times for men and women

584
00:23:32.597 --> 00:23:35.477
to come back together and if I can give you a little story

585
00:23:35.477 --> 00:23:38.037
of a man, he came to me.

586
00:23:38.037 --> 00:23:40.457
He had very bad rheumatoid arthritis in his hands.

587
00:23:40.457 --> 00:23:43.077
He'd had it in all his body, but it had burnt out.

588
00:23:43.077 --> 00:23:44.577
Now it was just in his hands.

589
00:23:44.577 --> 00:23:46.057
His hands were quite deformed,

590
00:23:46.057 --> 00:23:47.957
if you know of rheumatoid arthritis.

591
00:23:47.957 --> 00:23:50.877
And he said I don't know how I'm going to get rid of this.

592
00:23:50.877 --> 00:23:54.417
He worked very hard on himself psychologically, spiritually,

593
00:23:54.417 --> 00:23:58.397
and I said I could see these hands had been powerful

594
00:23:58.397 --> 00:23:59.977
at some point, and I said, have you ever,

595
00:23:59.977 --> 00:24:02.737
you know I have to say ever hurt anybody with those hands?

596
00:24:02.737 --> 00:24:04.497
He said funny you should mention that.

597
00:24:04.497 --> 00:24:06.877
He said one time my mother was tickling me

598
00:24:06.877 --> 00:24:08.717
and I got my hands around her neck

599
00:24:08.717 --> 00:24:10.477
and I wondered what I was doing.

600
00:24:10.477 --> 00:24:13.337
And another time in a bar, he'd gotten into a fight,

601
00:24:13.337 --> 00:24:16.417
and I said tell me about your family.

602
00:24:16.417 --> 00:24:19.077
He said my mother was a pacifist,

603
00:24:19.077 --> 00:24:21.097
and my father was a boxer.

604
00:24:21.097 --> 00:24:25.057
And what happened when he was young,

605
00:24:25.057 --> 00:24:28.037
his mother got a lover and got

606
00:24:28.037 --> 00:24:30.437
the lover coming into the house,

607
00:24:30.437 --> 00:24:34.337
and the young man was watching to see

608
00:24:34.337 --> 00:24:36.677
if his father would step up and be the man

609
00:24:36.677 --> 00:24:40.438
that he thought he should be, and he didn't.

610
00:24:40.438 --> 00:24:43.717
And here was a young boy caught up in his own rage,

611
00:24:43.717 --> 00:24:46.917
not only at his mother, but his father,

612
00:24:46.917 --> 00:24:49.457
and he said to me that recently he had been

613
00:24:49.457 --> 00:24:51.837
speaking to his wife and asking his wife

614
00:24:51.837 --> 00:24:54.797
did she ever feel that he might have ever hurt her,

615
00:24:54.797 --> 00:24:56.257
and she said sometimes.

616
00:24:56.257 --> 00:25:00.897
And he said oh my goodness, how could I with these hands?

617
00:25:00.897 --> 00:25:02.977
And his hands would never ever,

618
00:25:02.977 --> 00:25:04.737
I have to tell you, get better

619
00:25:04.737 --> 00:25:06.577
because his fear of ever letting himself

620
00:25:06.577 --> 00:25:09.877
get close to that emotion again was too high.

621
00:25:09.877 --> 00:25:13.537
He worked as a mediator, calming everybody down.

622
00:25:13.537 --> 00:25:17.337
But that's what I see, that especially for men,

623
00:25:17.337 --> 00:25:19.257
if they know that their rage is too high,

624
00:25:19.257 --> 00:25:22.157
nobody's ever given them permission to let it out,

625
00:25:22.157 --> 00:25:26.557
they may go into some, I have to say spiritual makeup

626
00:25:26.557 --> 00:25:28.577
that will allow them to be pacifists.

627
00:25:28.577 --> 00:25:30.797
<v Regina>Or extreme sports</v>

628
00:25:30.797 --> 00:25:32.257
to let it out.
<v ->Or extreme sports.</v>

629
00:25:32.257 --> 00:25:35.377
But the ability to actually find a balance for it

630
00:25:35.377 --> 00:25:38.677
is so important and when I talk about emotions,

631
00:25:38.677 --> 00:25:40.877
anger is the energy of change.

632
00:25:40.877 --> 00:25:42.337
You either have to change your opinion

633
00:25:42.337 --> 00:25:43.737
or change your attitude.

634
00:25:43.737 --> 00:25:47.397
It's a vital part of the whole acupuncture,

635
00:25:47.397 --> 00:25:49.577
Chinese philosophy.

636
00:25:49.577 --> 00:25:51.197
It's the energy of movement.

637
00:25:51.197 --> 00:25:52.617
Well we're not taught that.

638
00:25:52.617 --> 00:25:55.737
We're taught it's bad, just get rid of it.

639
00:25:55.737 --> 00:25:57.897
Whereas if I get frustrated, I say that when

640
00:25:57.897 --> 00:26:00.137
I get frustrated, I need to move.

641
00:26:00.137 --> 00:26:03.677
I don't need to say ohm, calm.

642
00:26:03.677 --> 00:26:06.697
I've got something inside me going get out of here Chris,

643
00:26:06.697 --> 00:26:08.257
do something.

644
00:26:08.257 --> 00:26:11.517
And in acupuncture, we have a meridian, the liver meridian

645
00:26:11.517 --> 00:26:14.377
that serves anger, the energy of movement.

646
00:26:14.377 --> 00:26:16.897
It goes in the big toe, up here to the womb,

647
00:26:16.897 --> 00:26:20.037
gall bladder, throat, eye.

648
00:26:20.037 --> 00:26:22.757
And in medicine, we see people who have got gout

649
00:26:22.757 --> 00:26:25.177
in the big toe, we take the varicose veins out,

650
00:26:25.177 --> 00:26:28.117
we take their womb out, we take their gall bladder out,

651
00:26:28.117 --> 00:26:29.477
they haven't got good throats,

652
00:26:29.477 --> 00:26:31.877
and their eyes aren't working too well.

653
00:26:31.877 --> 00:26:33.177
But we never link them.

654
00:26:33.177 --> 00:26:36.577
We never say wow I wonder what this connection is.

655
00:26:36.577 --> 00:26:38.737
<v Regina>Isn't it amazing that it's taken us</v>

656
00:26:38.737 --> 00:26:42.895
this long to remember that it's all connected?

657
00:26:42.895 --> 00:26:45.575
And so you talked earlier, you alluded to the fact

658
00:26:45.575 --> 00:26:47.595
that there are other deeper parts

659
00:26:47.595 --> 00:26:49.375
that we don't want to look at,

660
00:26:49.375 --> 00:26:52.935
and it's not just the mirrors and that person ticks me off,

661
00:26:52.935 --> 00:26:54.095
it's much deeper than that.

662
00:26:54.095 --> 00:26:55.615
Can you go ahead on that?

663
00:26:55.615 --> 00:26:58.175
<v ->What I want is to go up to the level that we say</v>

664
00:26:58.175 --> 00:27:01.155
that we are divine beings, eternal beings,

665
00:27:01.155 --> 00:27:04.275
creative beings, that's the meaning of the word human.

666
00:27:04.275 --> 00:27:07.455
And I do not see that being spiritual is being up there,

667
00:27:07.455 --> 00:27:10.455
and being any less than is down here.

668
00:27:10.455 --> 00:27:14.455
I am as spiritual here as I am anywhere else.

669
00:27:14.455 --> 00:27:16.395
And I work a lot with holograms,

670
00:27:16.395 --> 00:27:19.395
which basically say there is nothing out there.

671
00:27:19.395 --> 00:27:20.895
So I say to people when they're telling me

672
00:27:20.895 --> 00:27:25.035
that person's the problem, no they are just part of you.

673
00:27:25.035 --> 00:27:27.615
And I was listening to Rupert Sheldrake recently,

674
00:27:27.615 --> 00:27:29.975
and he was talking about the morphogenic fields

675
00:27:29.975 --> 00:27:32.875
and he spoke about truly how the field

676
00:27:32.875 --> 00:27:34.875
we carry around with us,

677
00:27:34.875 --> 00:27:37.415
and that was the best example, I would say,

678
00:27:37.415 --> 00:27:39.395
of my understanding of the hologram.

679
00:27:39.395 --> 00:27:42.115
We carry our blueprint with us.

680
00:27:42.115 --> 00:27:47.115
We then attract towards us from this energetic blueprint,

681
00:27:47.135 --> 00:27:49.655
people or situations that will awaken

682
00:27:49.655 --> 00:27:51.675
the blueprint within us.

683
00:27:51.675 --> 00:27:54.295
So everybody in their own environment who,

684
00:27:54.295 --> 00:27:56.975
again stimulates us, and wakes us up,

685
00:27:56.975 --> 00:28:00.155
aggravates us, whatever, or we look up to,

686
00:28:00.155 --> 00:28:02.555
is a part of our blueprint that we can't see.

687
00:28:02.555 --> 00:28:04.295
<v Regina>So that's to be embraced?</v>

688
00:28:04.295 --> 00:28:07.015
<v ->Embrace them so that again, I say,</v>

689
00:28:07.015 --> 00:28:09.415
if you have an emotional reaction, that's a great sign

690
00:28:09.415 --> 00:28:11.435
to say there's something in you

691
00:28:11.435 --> 00:28:14.435
or something in this situation that is valuable for me.

692
00:28:14.435 --> 00:28:16.855
<v Regina>No more going out for a beer</v>

693
00:28:16.855 --> 00:28:19.075
and getting drunk because you can't deal

694
00:28:19.075 --> 00:28:20.075
with the feeling.

695
00:28:20.075 --> 00:28:22.115
<v ->Exactly, now you can go out for beer.</v>

696
00:28:22.115 --> 00:28:23.955
(laughter)

697
00:28:23.955 --> 00:28:26.275
So I'm not saying if something terrible happens,

698
00:28:26.275 --> 00:28:28.935
you shouldn't have a normal human response,

699
00:28:28.935 --> 00:28:30.755
but when we jump up and down and say

700
00:28:30.755 --> 00:28:33.655
I'm gonna fight that or that's there and we judge,

701
00:28:33.655 --> 00:28:36.215
we really need to look at who we're judging

702
00:28:36.215 --> 00:28:38.195
because there's something in that situation

703
00:28:38.195 --> 00:28:40.535
that is causing us to be disturbed.

704
00:28:40.535 --> 00:28:42.715
Disturbing our vibratory field,

705
00:28:42.715 --> 00:28:44.755
disturbing our equilibrium.

706
00:28:44.755 --> 00:28:46.955
But I want to say from a soul point of view,

707
00:28:46.955 --> 00:28:50.255
we've called it in because if I may talk about

708
00:28:50.255 --> 00:28:52.195
what's going on in this present time,

709
00:28:52.195 --> 00:28:53.235
<v Regina>Yes please.</v>

710
00:28:53.235 --> 00:28:55.815
<v ->We are, at this moment in time, at an end</v>

711
00:28:55.815 --> 00:28:58.875
of what we see at a 26,000 year cycle.

712
00:28:58.875 --> 00:29:01.515
That 26,000 years has somewhat to do

713
00:29:01.515 --> 00:29:04.535
with the rotation or the wobble of the earth,

714
00:29:04.535 --> 00:29:06.155
the procession of the equinoxes,

715
00:29:06.155 --> 00:29:08.215
and also in the movement of the sun.

716
00:29:08.215 --> 00:29:11.355
But primarily that wobble takes 26,000 years,

717
00:29:11.355 --> 00:29:14.595
and the sun and us, by implication,

718
00:29:14.595 --> 00:29:17.775
are actually the closest we get to the galactic center

719
00:29:17.775 --> 00:29:20.195
that we've been in 26,000 years.

720
00:29:20.195 --> 00:29:22.795
And at this moment, our sun is literally passing

721
00:29:22.795 --> 00:29:27.115
over the opening, passing over the black hole

722
00:29:27.115 --> 00:29:28.715
that is the galactic center.

723
00:29:28.715 --> 00:29:31.295
So it's like the vibration is strong.

724
00:29:31.295 --> 00:29:33.735
So what do we perceive is behind that?

725
00:29:33.735 --> 00:29:35.835
We know the universe is,

726
00:29:35.835 --> 00:29:37.975
so if we wanted to take it metaphorically,

727
00:29:37.975 --> 00:29:40.475
the galactic center is known as

728
00:29:40.475 --> 00:29:42.015
the heart of the great mother.

729
00:29:42.015 --> 00:29:44.215
Behind that, through the heart,

730
00:29:44.215 --> 00:29:45.855
we are being given the opportunity

731
00:29:45.855 --> 00:29:48.235
to know abundance unlimitedness.

732
00:29:48.235 --> 00:29:51.115
So for these 36 years that it takes for the sun

733
00:29:51.115 --> 00:29:53.075
to pass across this opening,

734
00:29:53.075 --> 00:29:56.415
we are in this place of high vibration,

735
00:29:56.415 --> 00:29:58.095
what we've all been waiting for,

736
00:29:58.095 --> 00:29:59.835
26,000 years we've been going around,

737
00:29:59.835 --> 00:30:01.955
and nearly coming, nearly there.

738
00:30:01.955 --> 00:30:03.195
We're there.

739
00:30:03.195 --> 00:30:04.335
And what does that mean?

740
00:30:04.335 --> 00:30:06.675
It means that it's almost like we are all

741
00:30:06.675 --> 00:30:08.595
being able to start again.

742
00:30:08.595 --> 00:30:10.956
It's like okay clear the slate,

743
00:30:10.956 --> 00:30:12.735
we're gonna create a new world.

744
00:30:12.735 --> 00:30:15.555
And for the Mayans, they call that the fifth world.

745
00:30:15.555 --> 00:30:18.015
Others may call it the sixth race,

746
00:30:18.015 --> 00:30:19.895
whatever words you want to use.

747
00:30:19.895 --> 00:30:21.315
For the Mayans, they see it the new world

748
00:30:21.315 --> 00:30:25.635
that's going to start, be born on the 21st of December, 2012

749
00:30:25.635 --> 00:30:30.635
but be seen more fully by the 2020's, early 2020's.

750
00:30:31.135 --> 00:30:34.115
But you can imagine that being so close

751
00:30:34.115 --> 00:30:36.375
to this galactic center and this universe,

752
00:30:36.375 --> 00:30:41.375
and this high vibration, anything that we're still

753
00:30:41.475 --> 00:30:45.015
carrying with us as baggage, is going to bump up against us.

754
00:30:45.015 --> 00:30:47.195
It's like who's going to be able to go through

755
00:30:47.195 --> 00:30:48.495
the eye of the needle?

756
00:30:48.495 --> 00:30:49.875
We won't get through the eye of the needle

757
00:30:49.875 --> 00:30:53.635
because of our baggage from the last 26,000 years.

758
00:30:53.635 --> 00:30:56.595
The other part of it is that every time

759
00:30:56.595 --> 00:30:58.295
we take a part of ourselves that,

760
00:30:58.295 --> 00:31:01.175
every time we create a story, every time we create

761
00:31:01.175 --> 00:31:04.995
an experience, a part of us is in that story.

762
00:31:04.995 --> 00:31:06.675
Part of our consciousness is the part

763
00:31:06.675 --> 00:31:09.315
that allowed the story to develop.

764
00:31:09.315 --> 00:31:12.895
If we don't reclaim that consciousness

765
00:31:12.895 --> 00:31:17.715
now with wisdom intact, it gets lost in the story.

766
00:31:17.715 --> 00:31:19.715
This is the moment where we have to go and say

767
00:31:19.715 --> 00:31:22.015
now which bits did I leave lying about?

768
00:31:22.015 --> 00:31:24.015
We have to reclaim our consciousness.

769
00:31:24.015 --> 00:31:25.475
Our soul's consciousness.

770
00:31:25.475 --> 00:31:29.395
And in doing that, as we do, we bring the light

771
00:31:29.395 --> 00:31:32.575
into our hearts or the heart brings the light out.

772
00:31:32.575 --> 00:31:35.155
And it is the light body that can travel through

773
00:31:35.155 --> 00:31:37.855
the center of the galaxy to the universe.

774
00:31:37.855 --> 00:31:41.815
Pick up the information and create this new world.

775
00:31:41.815 --> 00:31:44.635
<v Regina>It requires a good amount of courage</v>

776
00:31:44.635 --> 00:31:47.335
on the part of each and every one of us that is alive

777
00:31:47.335 --> 00:31:49.235
and incarnated at this point in time.

778
00:31:49.235 --> 00:31:52.095
So our challenge is to drop all that we've known

779
00:31:52.095 --> 00:31:53.895
and held as comfortable.

780
00:31:53.895 --> 00:31:58.395
<v ->Yes, and recognize that everything has value in it.</v>

781
00:31:58.395 --> 00:32:01.835
So this is the key that if your part of your consciousness

782
00:32:01.835 --> 00:32:05.335
that created that story, dropping the story

783
00:32:05.335 --> 00:32:07.015
without knowing why you created it,

784
00:32:07.015 --> 00:32:09.495
you've lost the opportunity.

785
00:32:09.495 --> 00:32:12.075
This is where we have to gain wisdom.

786
00:32:12.075 --> 00:32:14.955
And we talk about going into the underworld,

787
00:32:14.955 --> 00:32:17.115
which is a part of every tradition,

788
00:32:17.115 --> 00:32:19.135
talks about the journey to the underworld,

789
00:32:19.135 --> 00:32:21.775
through the labyrinthe, interesting.

790
00:32:21.775 --> 00:32:23.555
I want to say labyrinthes are not about going out,

791
00:32:23.555 --> 00:32:25.555
they're about going down,

792
00:32:25.555 --> 00:32:29.415
and in that underworld, this is where we meet

793
00:32:29.415 --> 00:32:32.775
our dark goddess, but it is also where we meet

794
00:32:32.775 --> 00:32:35.795
the parts of us that we've become separated by.

795
00:32:35.795 --> 00:32:39.255
And often they would say that Pluto rules the underworld,

796
00:32:39.255 --> 00:32:44.015
the god or goddess, and Pluto actually means a gem.

797
00:32:44.015 --> 00:32:47.295
So it's really saying when you go inside,

798
00:32:47.295 --> 00:32:50.255
that you'll find the gems of wisdom.

799
00:32:50.255 --> 00:32:54.075
And it's those gems of wisdom that you take to your heart

800
00:32:54.075 --> 00:32:57.055
that become the full lifts of light.

801
00:32:57.055 --> 00:32:58.495
<v Regina>And sometimes it's the dark knight</v>

802
00:32:58.495 --> 00:33:00.555
of the soul that is actually the entry point

803
00:33:00.555 --> 00:33:01.855
into this experience.

804
00:33:01.855 --> 00:33:04.955
<v ->Exactly, and if I could find a different name for it,</v>

805
00:33:04.955 --> 00:33:06.455
only because people go ugghh, but

806
00:33:06.455 --> 00:33:07.895
the dark knight of the soul says

807
00:33:07.895 --> 00:33:10.395
here I am, I was crowned king, ta dah.

808
00:33:10.395 --> 00:33:13.935
I'm all successful, but I don't feel it.

809
00:33:13.935 --> 00:33:16.935
And why you don't feel it is there's something missing,

810
00:33:16.935 --> 00:33:18.575
and I learned a while back that there's

811
00:33:18.575 --> 00:33:21.075
a difference between success and fulfillment.

812
00:33:21.075 --> 00:33:24.515
And fulfillment is the embodiment of my journey,

813
00:33:24.515 --> 00:33:27.795
where success is an external experience.

814
00:33:27.795 --> 00:33:30.295
This is an internal experience.

815
00:33:30.295 --> 00:33:33.895
And it's the lover, you have to call down the lover.

816
00:33:33.895 --> 00:33:36.695
That's why I spoke about the vesica piscis,

817
00:33:36.695 --> 00:33:40.435
the lover, the coming together, the willingness

818
00:33:40.435 --> 00:33:43.195
to recognize that you love yourself at the level

819
00:33:43.195 --> 00:33:45.255
that you will descend.

820
00:33:45.255 --> 00:33:47.975
And it is from a place of courage, but courage

821
00:33:47.975 --> 00:33:51.015
the word, comes from cur, which is the heart.

822
00:33:51.015 --> 00:33:54.655
So it is of the heart that you do that descent.

823
00:33:54.655 --> 00:33:58.055
<v Regina>And the heart has been, you spoke about it,</v>

824
00:33:58.055 --> 00:34:00.295
a number of people that I've interviewed have also

825
00:34:00.295 --> 00:34:02.855
spoken about this, in terms of just

826
00:34:02.855 --> 00:34:06.455
the energy output alone that the energetic of the heart

827
00:34:06.455 --> 00:34:10.033
has 50 times the strength of that of the mind,

828
00:34:10.033 --> 00:34:12.233
and yet it's the part that we run right over.

829
00:34:12.233 --> 00:34:14.373
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

830
00:34:14.373 --> 00:34:15.713
<v Regina>We don't listen to.</v>

831
00:34:15.713 --> 00:34:17.293
We tend to ignore.

832
00:34:17.293 --> 00:34:19.653
<v ->We don't, and I think we're all talking about</v>

833
00:34:19.653 --> 00:34:21.833
a strengthening or a deepening of what we,

834
00:34:21.833 --> 00:34:24.193
we might have seen the heart as a chakra system,

835
00:34:24.193 --> 00:34:26.293
well now we're talking about this deepened heart,

836
00:34:26.293 --> 00:34:29.133
what a more cosmic heart, a more divine heart.

837
00:34:29.133 --> 00:34:30.373
<v Regina>Yes, talk about that for a moment</v>

838
00:34:30.373 --> 00:34:33.033
because this notion of love is really something

839
00:34:33.033 --> 00:34:34.893
much more sublime than what we understand.

840
00:34:34.893 --> 00:34:35.993
<v ->Exactly.</v>

841
00:34:35.993 --> 00:34:37.553
<v Regina>in connections with individuals.</v>

842
00:34:37.553 --> 00:34:41.073
<v ->Yes, and for me, the word love means connection,</v>

843
00:34:41.073 --> 00:34:42.333
so it's the very word.

844
00:34:42.333 --> 00:34:45.373
It is about making connections.

845
00:34:45.373 --> 00:34:47.093
It's about relationship.

846
00:34:47.093 --> 00:34:50.813
I remember a wonderful Kohunu I knew,

847
00:34:50.813 --> 00:34:54.353
he said what's the irony is once you make that relationship,

848
00:34:54.353 --> 00:34:56.093
it's almost like love doesn't exist because

849
00:34:56.093 --> 00:34:57.373
you've made that connection.

850
00:34:57.373 --> 00:35:00.153
You can't find love, it is.

851
00:35:00.153 --> 00:35:01.193
It is that energy.

852
00:35:01.193 --> 00:35:01.853
<v Regina>It's the state of being.</v>

853
00:35:01.853 --> 00:35:03.633
<v ->It's the state of being in that relationship.</v>

854
00:35:03.633 --> 00:35:06.473
Now you imagine if we saw everything,

855
00:35:06.473 --> 00:35:08.973
everything is connected to us,

856
00:35:08.973 --> 00:35:11.093
and that's what I see in alchemy

857
00:35:11.093 --> 00:35:13.293
in terms of what I'm working towards.

858
00:35:13.293 --> 00:35:15.253
It means all chemistry.

859
00:35:15.253 --> 00:35:17.493
It means I am everything.

860
00:35:17.493 --> 00:35:21.433
And when someone says well God wouldn't have created that,

861
00:35:21.433 --> 00:35:22.553
well that doesn't make sense to me.

862
00:35:22.553 --> 00:35:25.053
If you believe we all come from the one source,

863
00:35:25.053 --> 00:35:28.593
everything and anybody, whatever we think of them,

864
00:35:28.593 --> 00:35:30.013
is part of the Godhead.

865
00:35:30.013 --> 00:35:32.733
The ocean of possibility, so why should we judge them?

866
00:35:32.733 --> 00:35:34.493
<v Regina>Yes, and we've chosen to be here</v>

867
00:35:34.493 --> 00:35:38.033
all together now to have this experience together,

868
00:35:38.033 --> 00:35:39.383
to lift ourselves together.

869
00:35:39.383 --> 00:35:43.143
<v ->Exactly, and once you move beyond the individual,</v>

870
00:35:43.143 --> 00:35:44.883
and this is what you're asking me,

871
00:35:44.883 --> 00:35:47.883
you cannot see health as an individual statement.

872
00:35:47.883 --> 00:35:50.363
Mind, body, spirit, wholeness.

873
00:35:50.363 --> 00:35:52.983
Can I be whole when you are not well?

874
00:35:52.983 --> 00:35:54.783
I can't be disconnected from you.

875
00:35:54.783 --> 00:35:55.743
We know that in families.

876
00:35:55.743 --> 00:35:58.003
Families always need to be healed as a whole.

877
00:35:58.003 --> 00:35:59.843
In tribal situations, you probably know,

878
00:35:59.843 --> 00:36:03.563
if one person gets sick, it's the whole tribe that is ill,

879
00:36:03.563 --> 00:36:05.423
and the person is just the messenger

880
00:36:05.423 --> 00:36:07.523
for the illness of the tribe.

881
00:36:07.523 --> 00:36:10.503
You imagine if we treated our world like that,

882
00:36:10.503 --> 00:36:11.463
or our country like that.

883
00:36:11.463 --> 00:36:12.463
(laughter)

884
00:36:12.463 --> 00:36:13.123
<v Regina>Oh goodness.</v>

885
00:36:13.123 --> 00:36:15.623
<v ->Imagine how we would heal if we said</v>

886
00:36:15.623 --> 00:36:18.783
if there's one sick person, maybe like the boy

887
00:36:18.783 --> 00:36:22.723
who did the killing, that the whole country is sick.

888
00:36:22.723 --> 00:36:24.363
Our whole world is,

889
00:36:24.363 --> 00:36:27.083
and that we are an expression of him.

890
00:36:27.083 --> 00:36:31.343
Then we bring healing, instead of turning our back

891
00:36:31.343 --> 00:36:33.123
or saying that's just one individual.

892
00:36:33.123 --> 00:36:34.543
It's nothing to do with us.

893
00:36:34.543 --> 00:36:37.983
<v Regina>Yes, we can feel on a visceral level</v>

894
00:36:37.983 --> 00:36:41.323
now as the years progress when these types of things occur,

895
00:36:41.323 --> 00:36:44.943
such as that mass killing, that this really is

896
00:36:44.943 --> 00:36:48.683
reflecting something deeper within not just society,

897
00:36:48.683 --> 00:36:51.083
but on a global level almost.

898
00:36:51.083 --> 00:36:52.063
This happens globally.

899
00:36:52.063 --> 00:36:55.283
<v ->It is, and I see that what is happening is</v>

900
00:36:55.283 --> 00:36:58.543
we are going to be brought together through compassion,

901
00:36:58.543 --> 00:37:00.983
and compassion is the understanding,

902
00:37:00.983 --> 00:37:03.243
the love through understanding,

903
00:37:03.243 --> 00:37:06.363
but understanding is not head understanding.

904
00:37:06.363 --> 00:37:09.183
It's the walking the mile in someone's moccasins.

905
00:37:09.183 --> 00:37:11.603
<v Regina>And this comes right, if we come right</v>

906
00:37:11.603 --> 00:37:14.243
back around to healing, and health and well-being,

907
00:37:14.243 --> 00:37:16.283
that this comes down to a cellular level.

908
00:37:16.283 --> 00:37:19.783
This connection between the cells of the body,

909
00:37:19.783 --> 00:37:24.603
and as a microcosm for the macro.

910
00:37:24.603 --> 00:37:26.703
And can you address that just a little bit

911
00:37:26.703 --> 00:37:29.023
so we can really understand on a deep level

912
00:37:29.023 --> 00:37:30.303
in our own beings.

913
00:37:30.303 --> 00:37:32.383
<v ->I will speak about it two ways.</v>

914
00:37:32.383 --> 00:37:33.483
One is the heart.

915
00:37:33.483 --> 00:37:36.723
We were talking about, I spoke of the example,

916
00:37:36.723 --> 00:37:38.223
which might have been spoken about before,

917
00:37:38.223 --> 00:37:40.623
but it's so brilliant to hear that you know that

918
00:37:40.623 --> 00:37:43.463
if you take a heart cell, you can actually put it in a dish,

919
00:37:43.463 --> 00:37:45.683
and it will keep beating, and to me,

920
00:37:45.683 --> 00:37:48.563
that means that that cell isn't connected to the brain.

921
00:37:48.563 --> 00:37:50.143
It doesn't need the brain.

922
00:37:50.143 --> 00:37:52.903
It is actually connected to something much bigger.

923
00:37:52.903 --> 00:37:54.703
And I think that's what we're gonna find

924
00:37:54.703 --> 00:37:57.143
is that there is the morphogenic field.

925
00:37:57.143 --> 00:38:00.303
There is the connectedness that is outside

926
00:38:00.303 --> 00:38:03.483
our ability to measure at this time,

927
00:38:03.483 --> 00:38:06.103
but it's what makes one twin know when another twin

928
00:38:06.103 --> 00:38:07.983
is not well, what makes a mother know

929
00:38:07.983 --> 00:38:09.943
when her child isn't well.

930
00:38:09.943 --> 00:38:13.143
It's what makes us call on each other across the world

931
00:38:13.143 --> 00:38:16.163
and know to pick up the phone and to do something.

932
00:38:16.163 --> 00:38:18.363
<v Regina>And as you also say, oh I'm sorry.</v>

933
00:38:18.363 --> 00:38:20.603
<v ->So if I just say this, that's the independence.</v>

934
00:38:20.603 --> 00:38:23.623
We also know then, that if we bring two cells together,

935
00:38:23.623 --> 00:38:25.883
that if one is well and one isn't,

936
00:38:25.883 --> 00:38:30.763
the well one will entrain the other back into health again,

937
00:38:30.763 --> 00:38:32.923
and I think that's very important,

938
00:38:32.923 --> 00:38:35.503
and I say that, I always felt as a doctor,

939
00:38:35.503 --> 00:38:37.203
I was the one that people didn't like

940
00:38:37.203 --> 00:38:38.623
to walk into their room.

941
00:38:38.623 --> 00:38:40.043
It was like oh she's bringing bad news,

942
00:38:40.043 --> 00:38:41.563
but they always felt good when the woman

943
00:38:41.563 --> 00:38:44.883
who did the flowers came in, or sold the newspapers.

944
00:38:44.883 --> 00:38:48.503
And we all know there are people who just light up our life.

945
00:38:48.503 --> 00:38:51.303
Then they've never been to any training on being a healer.

946
00:38:51.303 --> 00:38:53.983
They are congruent with themselves.

947
00:38:53.983 --> 00:38:55.843
And they may swear and curse, and they may,

948
00:38:55.843 --> 00:38:58.143
but they're authentic.

949
00:38:58.143 --> 00:39:00.763
And it's that authenticity, that congruency

950
00:39:00.763 --> 00:39:04.243
that is of the heart, that entrainment back to the heart,

951
00:39:04.243 --> 00:39:06.483
and then the last experiment was the two cells

952
00:39:06.483 --> 00:39:08.023
that are both ill.

953
00:39:08.023 --> 00:39:10.603
When bringing them together to a certain distance,

954
00:39:10.603 --> 00:39:13.383
they still both go back into wellness.

955
00:39:13.383 --> 00:39:14.763
<v Regina>And that's interesting.</v>

956
00:39:14.763 --> 00:39:16.003
How does that reflect itself in our world

957
00:39:16.003 --> 00:39:17.743
and in our societies?

958
00:39:17.743 --> 00:39:20.403
<v ->Yes, that to me is about relationship.</v>

959
00:39:20.403 --> 00:39:22.743
<v Regina>That's really incredible.</v>

960
00:39:22.743 --> 00:39:25.843
<v ->Yes, and in heart disease, what we know</v>

961
00:39:25.843 --> 00:39:27.843
is the major features of heart disease

962
00:39:27.843 --> 00:39:31.123
are loneliness and denial.

963
00:39:31.123 --> 00:39:34.083
And loneliness, you can be lonely in a crowd,

964
00:39:34.083 --> 00:39:36.816
and I meet people who have never shared

965
00:39:36.816 --> 00:39:38.636
their heart with their loved ones,

966
00:39:38.636 --> 00:39:39.996
or nobody's ever asked them.

967
00:39:39.996 --> 00:39:41.656
I've asked people tell me what gives you joy,

968
00:39:41.656 --> 00:39:43.996
and they've gone, wow nobody's ever asked me that.

969
00:39:43.996 --> 00:39:46.256
And we're not talking about bliss,

970
00:39:46.256 --> 00:39:49.516
we're talking about what is it in your day-to-day

971
00:39:49.516 --> 00:39:52.696
that makes your heart sing?

972
00:39:52.696 --> 00:39:55.516
Larry LeShan, I don't know if you've interviewed him,

973
00:39:55.516 --> 00:39:59.936
but great psychologist, and he wrote a lot on cancer.

974
00:39:59.936 --> 00:40:02.296
And he would say to all his cancer patients,

975
00:40:02.296 --> 00:40:07.296
so what makes your heart sing and do what your heart sings.

976
00:40:07.456 --> 00:40:10.876
<v Regina>And it seems to have got bumped down</v>

977
00:40:10.876 --> 00:40:15.876
to a very low status on our list of priorities day-to-day

978
00:40:16.416 --> 00:40:19.816
and that must be recovered.

979
00:40:19.816 --> 00:40:22.676
<v ->And that's why, fortunately, I'm in the job I'm in</v>

980
00:40:22.676 --> 00:40:24.936
because illness makes people listen.

981
00:40:24.936 --> 00:40:25.976
(laughter)

982
00:40:25.976 --> 00:40:27.636
<v Regina>Oh yes that's true.</v>

983
00:40:27.636 --> 00:40:29.876
We're much more open when we're not feeling well.

984
00:40:29.876 --> 00:40:31.896
<v ->Exactly and of course, I've been with those</v>

985
00:40:31.896 --> 00:40:34.496
who are seriously ill and I see 60% of illness

986
00:40:34.496 --> 00:40:36.516
as a wake-up call from the soul.

987
00:40:36.516 --> 00:40:39.656
And I see and I love the body.

988
00:40:39.656 --> 00:40:42.136
I mean the mind as well, but because I've worked

989
00:40:42.136 --> 00:40:44.856
primarily with the body, the body loves you

990
00:40:44.856 --> 00:40:46.016
more than you would know.

991
00:40:46.016 --> 00:40:49.976
The starting point is recognizing the body is not the enemy.

992
00:40:49.976 --> 00:40:52.836
And of course getting rid of words like I'm struggling

993
00:40:52.836 --> 00:40:55.716
or suffering, I'm a victim, or if I'm fighting cancer,

994
00:40:55.716 --> 00:40:59.136
these are words that the body just cringes

995
00:40:59.136 --> 00:41:00.076
like your heart does.

996
00:41:00.076 --> 00:41:02.296
I always think your heart loves

997
00:41:02.296 --> 00:41:04.136
to be able to be spontaneous.

998
00:41:04.136 --> 00:41:06.336
Your heart is fed by spontaneity.

999
00:41:06.336 --> 00:41:09.016
So when I hear people who are at potential for heart disease

1000
00:41:09.016 --> 00:41:12.236
saying oh I can't do that, oh I mustn't do that,

1001
00:41:12.236 --> 00:41:14.396
I shouldn't do that, I can feel the joy

1002
00:41:14.396 --> 00:41:16.796
squeezing out of my heart,

1003
00:41:16.796 --> 00:41:19.576
and what was interesting is up til what 20 years ago,

1004
00:41:19.576 --> 00:41:22.536
women didn't get heart disease until they were in their 50's

1005
00:41:22.536 --> 00:41:24.676
and what's happened over the last 20 years,

1006
00:41:24.676 --> 00:41:28.296
women have given way to these same commandments,

1007
00:41:28.296 --> 00:41:30.256
I've got a pension, I've got kids to do,

1008
00:41:30.256 --> 00:41:31.196
I've got a mortgage.

1009
00:41:31.196 --> 00:41:34.736
So at the cost of our so-called independence,

1010
00:41:34.736 --> 00:41:38.196
we now have women dying of heart disease at 28.

1011
00:41:38.196 --> 00:41:40.376
<v Regina>Really, you're seeing that young?</v>

1012
00:41:40.376 --> 00:41:43.956
<v ->Even, not younger, but by 28, we're getting lots</v>

1013
00:41:43.956 --> 00:41:46.396
of young women as well of course men.

1014
00:41:46.396 --> 00:41:47.636
<v Regina>And with the men,</v>

1015
00:41:47.636 --> 00:41:48.856
it's younger and younger as well?

1016
00:41:48.856 --> 00:41:50.856
<v ->Women now, it's almost the biggest killer.</v>

1017
00:41:50.856 --> 00:41:52.476
<v Regina>Yes, yes.</v>

1018
00:41:52.476 --> 00:41:54.756
<v ->And women, we didn't have heart disease</v>

1019
00:41:54.756 --> 00:41:56.816
because we were protected by estrogen.

1020
00:41:58.506 --> 00:42:02.056
<v Regina>Now we need to bring both</v>

1021
00:42:02.056 --> 00:42:05.416
because before, the men would die early

1022
00:42:05.416 --> 00:42:08.196
because they were suffering their own kind of oppression,

1023
00:42:08.196 --> 00:42:10.876
and suppression of their own joys,

1024
00:42:10.876 --> 00:42:12.956
and that's not acceptable any longer,

1025
00:42:12.956 --> 00:42:16.916
and to give one self permission to have joy

1026
00:42:16.916 --> 00:42:19.256
at the top of the list, would you say

1027
00:42:19.256 --> 00:42:21.216
that might be the first priority?

1028
00:42:21.216 --> 00:42:24.176
<v ->Absolutely, I mean, I appreciate it's what you care about,</v>

1029
00:42:24.176 --> 00:42:28.036
but I used to work very close to the Ford factory

1030
00:42:28.036 --> 00:42:30.116
when I was working in England, and

1031
00:42:30.116 --> 00:42:32.276
I often used to say to people, when they would tell me,

1032
00:42:32.276 --> 00:42:34.456
I can't stop working because of this,

1033
00:42:34.456 --> 00:42:38.476
I'd say six foot under, I bet your family

1034
00:42:38.476 --> 00:42:39.736
don't actually care about the pension.

1035
00:42:39.736 --> 00:42:42.656
They don't care, but we have, I think in this country,

1036
00:42:42.656 --> 00:42:44.536
as we did in England, was have this,

1037
00:42:44.536 --> 00:42:46.576
but they died at their work.

1038
00:42:46.576 --> 00:42:48.316
We have in England this stiff upper lip,

1039
00:42:48.316 --> 00:42:50.576
but it's here as well, the honor of

1040
00:42:50.576 --> 00:42:52.936
at least you kept working til the last minute.

1041
00:42:52.936 --> 00:42:54.256
You're dead.

1042
00:42:54.256 --> 00:42:56.916
Nobody writes in the obituary died leaving a wife

1043
00:42:56.916 --> 00:43:01.076
and his grieving children who never ever knew their father,

1044
00:43:01.076 --> 00:43:02.636
<v Regina>Not juicy.</v>

1045
00:43:02.636 --> 00:43:04.976
<v ->No, we have this thing about</v>

1046
00:43:04.976 --> 00:43:07.916
isn't it wonderful to kill yourself in your job

1047
00:43:07.916 --> 00:43:12.916
where really, truly, we want people in our life,

1048
00:43:12.976 --> 00:43:15.496
and I speak to people, obviously,

1049
00:43:15.496 --> 00:43:16.876
who are concerned about their children.

1050
00:43:16.876 --> 00:43:19.476
I say the best thing you can give them is be a role model.

1051
00:43:19.476 --> 00:43:23.536
If you care about the health of your children, look at you.

1052
00:43:23.536 --> 00:43:25.076
What are you teaching them because

1053
00:43:25.076 --> 00:43:26.876
you are what they're watching.

1054
00:43:26.876 --> 00:43:31.476
<v Regina>And you, as you say so beautifully,</v>

1055
00:43:31.476 --> 00:43:33.936
the heart itself is a transformer.

1056
00:43:33.936 --> 00:43:36.536
<v ->Yes, yes, it will take you to places.</v>

1057
00:43:36.536 --> 00:43:39.116
I mean, from a scientific point of view,

1058
00:43:39.116 --> 00:43:42.676
the energy field is toroidal, and this toroid

1059
00:43:42.676 --> 00:43:46.456
is an ever-moving, a self-perpetuating field.

1060
00:43:46.456 --> 00:43:49.196
It's like a donut that constantly turns on itself.

1061
00:43:49.196 --> 00:43:52.376
But when I worked with it, I saw it as a transformer,

1062
00:43:52.376 --> 00:43:54.036
literally it is a transformer.

1063
00:43:54.036 --> 00:43:56.056
And in its capacity to transform,

1064
00:43:56.056 --> 00:43:59.576
it can take anything and take it either up or down.

1065
00:43:59.576 --> 00:44:03.516
So when you get an idea, you get excited by the idea

1066
00:44:03.516 --> 00:44:07.336
through your heart and you transform it into reality.

1067
00:44:07.336 --> 00:44:09.856
And at the same time, something you've created,

1068
00:44:09.856 --> 00:44:11.276
you take through your heart and you can

1069
00:44:11.276 --> 00:44:13.736
bring it out into the light.

1070
00:44:13.736 --> 00:44:15.736
And so everything we've created over these

1071
00:44:15.736 --> 00:44:19.176
26,000 years is coming home to us now.

1072
00:44:19.176 --> 00:44:22.256
And the most hard parts are the parts where

1073
00:44:22.256 --> 00:44:25.456
I'll carry on saying when we have shame and fear.

1074
00:44:25.456 --> 00:44:28.616
Times where in the past, we may have used power

1075
00:44:28.616 --> 00:44:31.916
in a misappropriate way, I have the gift

1076
00:44:31.916 --> 00:44:33.176
of being able to see past lives,

1077
00:44:33.176 --> 00:44:35.276
so most of the time I'm going hey,

1078
00:44:35.276 --> 00:44:37.216
I can tell you a million past lives when you did it.

1079
00:44:37.216 --> 00:44:38.936
We're not about one.

1080
00:44:38.936 --> 00:44:41.336
Don't bother to go to someone to learn about one.

1081
00:44:41.336 --> 00:44:42.996
I'll tell you most of them.

1082
00:44:42.996 --> 00:44:45.456
The fact of the matter if what are you gonna do differently?

1083
00:44:45.456 --> 00:44:47.336
And what I'm asking people to do is

1084
00:44:47.336 --> 00:44:49.636
to become masters of their emotions,

1085
00:44:49.636 --> 00:44:53.476
masters of their power, not suppression.

1086
00:44:53.476 --> 00:44:56.396
Because suppression is not mastery.

1087
00:44:56.396 --> 00:44:59.676
Celibacy does not teach you about sex.

1088
00:44:59.676 --> 00:45:02.556
You cannot master your sexual lust, as we know,

1089
00:45:02.556 --> 00:45:04.376
by becoming celibate.

1090
00:45:04.376 --> 00:45:06.796
It'll come out somewhere.

1091
00:45:06.796 --> 00:45:09.296
Just as you cannot master alcohol truly,

1092
00:45:09.296 --> 00:45:13.556
unless you have an understanding of where it's come from.

1093
00:45:13.556 --> 00:45:15.516
Why did you need the alcohol?

1094
00:45:15.516 --> 00:45:18.576
And I've worked with many alcoholics and drug addicts.

1095
00:45:18.576 --> 00:45:21.276
It's not the alcohol that kills you or the cigarettes,

1096
00:45:21.276 --> 00:45:23.416
it's the why you do it.

1097
00:45:23.416 --> 00:45:25.476
And to take away one addiction without

1098
00:45:25.476 --> 00:45:29.036
understanding that, another addiction will arise.

1099
00:45:29.036 --> 00:45:32.276
And so deeper is when I've worked with alcoholics

1100
00:45:32.276 --> 00:45:34.836
and the issue has been all around the solar plexus

1101
00:45:34.836 --> 00:45:37.576
or the liver, it's about self-worth.

1102
00:45:37.576 --> 00:45:40.916
And so unless the self-worth is healed,

1103
00:45:40.916 --> 00:45:44.236
and extreme sensitivity around the solar plexus

1104
00:45:44.236 --> 00:45:48.096
to insights, many of the alcoholics are very psychic

1105
00:45:48.096 --> 00:45:50.756
and very intuitive, but their self-worth

1106
00:45:50.756 --> 00:45:53.536
gets caught up in trying to please other people

1107
00:45:53.536 --> 00:45:55.336
or trying to doing what other people want.

1108
00:45:55.336 --> 00:45:58.256
And so the ability to actually say actually fine,

1109
00:45:58.256 --> 00:46:00.396
I'll give up the alcohol, I'll give up,

1110
00:46:00.396 --> 00:46:03.516
but I also need to learn how to develop my self-worth,

1111
00:46:03.516 --> 00:46:07.816
just as a cigarette smoker needs to learn how to speak

1112
00:46:07.816 --> 00:46:10.272
because one of the reasons you put the cigarette is

1113
00:46:10.272 --> 00:46:12.452
it's become a pacifier, a dummy.

1114
00:46:12.452 --> 00:46:14.432
And that's what probably someone kept doing to you

1115
00:46:14.432 --> 00:46:18.752
is oh be quiet, have a sweet, have a something.

1116
00:46:18.752 --> 00:46:23.092
And so it's the underlying causes of such diseases of such

1117
00:46:23.092 --> 00:46:28.092
a gift or objects that we use to quieten ourselves down.

1118
00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:33.250
<v Regina>How do we begin, as individuals,</v>

1119
00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:35.730
we'll say as individuals because we can understand

1120
00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:39.290
the impact collectively, to be able to take

1121
00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:42.690
those deeper looks inside to where we can get to a point

1122
00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:46.450
of genuine self-acceptance, therefore genuine love

1123
00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:48.450
of ourself and others?

1124
00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:50.550
<v ->So here would be my thoughts.</v>

1125
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:52.630
You asked me earlier about the body.

1126
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:54.550
Take the body as a friend,

1127
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:56.650
and I want to put that out very importantly.

1128
00:46:56.650 --> 00:46:58.810
I do a lot of work with talking to the body,

1129
00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:01.850
literally letting, I will ask the person about themselves,

1130
00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:03.990
and then we'll say let's talk to your shoulder,

1131
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:06.230
your back, and it amazes people

1132
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:09.950
how much knowledge and love the body has for you.

1133
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:12.350
And that would not be what they originally want.

1134
00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:14.510
And so people come up with answers.

1135
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:17.050
I'll ask though, can I tell a little story there?

1136
00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:19.710
A gentleman who had prostate problems,

1137
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:21.570
and he was always going backwards and forwards

1138
00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:23.430
to the toilets and he was in a,

1139
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:25.570
I have to say I was surprised he stepped forward

1140
00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:28.050
to do the demonstration because this wasn't a normal thing

1141
00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:30.890
for this gentleman in his 60's who had never ever

1142
00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:32.770
been to any sort of meeting like this.

1143
00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:35.570
As I asked him, he was willing to get into this,

1144
00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:37.970
and when I spoke to him, I said let's speak to your bladder,

1145
00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:41.590
and he could do it and out of this man's mouth came

1146
00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:43.595
the bladder said I'm fed up.

1147
00:47:43.595 --> 00:47:44.975
He's rushing here and there.

1148
00:47:44.975 --> 00:47:46.895
He never takes time for himself.

1149
00:47:46.895 --> 00:47:49.475
He says, I need him to slow down.

1150
00:47:49.475 --> 00:47:52.555
We're always on the go, which is exactly what was happening.

1151
00:47:52.555 --> 00:47:54.535
So I said does anybody else want to talk to us

1152
00:47:54.535 --> 00:47:57.595
and the heart came in and I said what do you want to say?

1153
00:47:57.595 --> 00:47:59.975
And from this man's mouth, the heart said,

1154
00:47:59.975 --> 00:48:02.835
I want him to go and get that canoe that he bought

1155
00:48:02.835 --> 00:48:06.115
and never used and take his grandchildren out on that canoe.

1156
00:48:06.115 --> 00:48:08.335
And I said wow, will he do it?

1157
00:48:08.335 --> 00:48:09.315
He said maybe.

1158
00:48:09.315 --> 00:48:10.695
And I said well tell him again and he did,

1159
00:48:10.695 --> 00:48:12.895
and I said heart, do you have anything else to say?

1160
00:48:12.895 --> 00:48:16.035
And out of this man's mouth, he said I love you.

1161
00:48:16.035 --> 00:48:18.395
And by now, I was in tears, the man was in tears,

1162
00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:21.615
so I said repeat it again, and from this man's mouth,

1163
00:48:21.615 --> 00:48:23.335
he said I love you.

1164
00:48:23.335 --> 00:48:26.915
And I said to the bladder, are you happy?

1165
00:48:26.915 --> 00:48:28.695
And he said I'm really happy.

1166
00:48:28.695 --> 00:48:30.275
<v Regina>Now that's transformative.</v>

1167
00:48:30.275 --> 00:48:33.855
<v ->And this was a five, ten minute session with a,</v>

1168
00:48:33.855 --> 00:48:38.015
as I say, no particular hypnosis, just a sense

1169
00:48:38.015 --> 00:48:39.595
of wanting to share.

1170
00:48:39.595 --> 00:48:41.635
The body wants to talk to us.

1171
00:48:41.635 --> 00:48:43.615
<v Regina>So maybe we need a little quiet time with our</v>

1172
00:48:43.615 --> 00:48:46.935
bodies, not just our desires, but with our bodies to listen.

1173
00:48:46.935 --> 00:48:49.275
<v ->Absolutely, I want you to know, this is the hologram,</v>

1174
00:48:49.275 --> 00:48:51.975
you need nothing outside this body.

1175
00:48:51.975 --> 00:48:56.095
This is the universe, and it's now a chemical vessel.

1176
00:48:56.095 --> 00:48:59.435
Every part of your body has an explicit,

1177
00:48:59.435 --> 00:49:01.295
and important part to play.

1178
00:49:01.295 --> 00:49:02.735
So this is your family.

1179
00:49:02.735 --> 00:49:04.055
This is it.

1180
00:49:04.055 --> 00:49:06.155
And every part's working for you.

1181
00:49:06.155 --> 00:49:08.315
And yet, what we tend to do is separate

1182
00:49:08.315 --> 00:49:10.335
the parts out and say well this bit doesn't work

1183
00:49:10.335 --> 00:49:14.095
or I'm angry at this part, and we take pain killer

1184
00:49:14.095 --> 00:49:16.555
instead of, it's like the red flashing light when

1185
00:49:16.555 --> 00:49:18.875
our fuel is running out, you know?

1186
00:49:18.875 --> 00:49:21.415
We don't put a little piece of paper over it,

1187
00:49:21.415 --> 00:49:24.075
or maybe we do, but we do when it comes to the body.

1188
00:49:24.075 --> 00:49:27.135
We take pain killers, we never listen to the messages.

1189
00:49:27.135 --> 00:49:30.655
We push on and in this country, worse than ever,

1190
00:49:30.655 --> 00:49:32.895
when I hear people having sports injuries,

1191
00:49:32.895 --> 00:49:35.175
they should have got the warning.

1192
00:49:35.175 --> 00:49:38.415
Instead they get a new shoulder, or a new elbow,

1193
00:49:38.415 --> 00:49:41.435
or a new knee instead of saying wow,

1194
00:49:41.435 --> 00:49:44.715
maybe my knee doesn't want to be doing this.

1195
00:49:44.715 --> 00:49:46.435
Maybe I need to talk to my body.

1196
00:49:46.435 --> 00:49:48.115
<v Regina>Our will overriding our wisdom.</v>

1197
00:49:48.115 --> 00:49:52.595
<v ->Yes, I remember speaking to Oz Nemetul, scuse me,</v>

1198
00:49:52.595 --> 00:49:55.035
the great cardiac surgeon, and he said,

1199
00:49:55.035 --> 00:49:57.995
everybody who comes to him for a new heart,

1200
00:49:57.995 --> 00:50:00.015
he says why should I give you another heart?

1201
00:50:00.015 --> 00:50:01.395
What did you do with the other one?

1202
00:50:01.395 --> 00:50:03.455
<v Regina>Amazing.</v>

1203
00:50:03.455 --> 00:50:05.175
Beautiful.

1204
00:50:05.175 --> 00:50:10.175
<v ->So the next thing I would say is talking to your body,</v>

1205
00:50:10.555 --> 00:50:13.755
highly I say is listen to your intuition.

1206
00:50:13.755 --> 00:50:17.055
And the intuition is the guidance that comes through,

1207
00:50:17.055 --> 00:50:20.295
your own inner guidance, what I'd call the virgin,

1208
00:50:20.295 --> 00:50:23.415
the virgin being the part of us that holds the blueprint.

1209
00:50:23.415 --> 00:50:25.195
She is complete unto herself.

1210
00:50:25.195 --> 00:50:27.235
It's our spiritual blueprint.

1211
00:50:27.235 --> 00:50:29.915
It's a higher self, and she speaks to us

1212
00:50:29.915 --> 00:50:31.535
through our intuition.

1213
00:50:31.535 --> 00:50:33.915
Now sometimes it will be a still small voice,

1214
00:50:33.915 --> 00:50:35.875
and sometimes it will be a hammer,

1215
00:50:35.875 --> 00:50:37.595
but she will speak to us.

1216
00:50:37.595 --> 00:50:42.595
And our intuition never blames, never cajoles,

1217
00:50:42.953 --> 00:50:44.573
never puts emotion in.

1218
00:50:44.573 --> 00:50:46.453
It is straight.

1219
00:50:46.453 --> 00:50:50.113
It says stop doing that, do this.

1220
00:50:50.113 --> 00:50:51.753
And it doesn't say it in a please,

1221
00:50:51.753 --> 00:50:54.453
or if you don't do this, I'll, it tells you,

1222
00:50:54.453 --> 00:50:55.713
and we've all heard it.

1223
00:50:55.713 --> 00:50:56.873
We've all heard it.

1224
00:50:56.873 --> 00:51:00.753
And it always works to connect us more fully with ourselves.

1225
00:51:00.753 --> 00:51:03.333
To our hearts, it's the navigator or our soul.

1226
00:51:03.333 --> 00:51:05.993
It's the heart connector, and that's what I see the heart as

1227
00:51:05.993 --> 00:51:09.713
as this ability to feel the pulse of your soul through it.

1228
00:51:09.713 --> 00:51:12.633
So it's where we feel why am I here?

1229
00:51:12.633 --> 00:51:13.713
What am I to do?

1230
00:51:13.713 --> 00:51:16.553
And the intuition will always work for love

1231
00:51:16.553 --> 00:51:18.273
and never for fear.

1232
00:51:18.273 --> 00:51:20.233
And in my moments, I've had to ask myself

1233
00:51:20.233 --> 00:51:22.433
am I doing this job from love or fear?

1234
00:51:22.433 --> 00:51:24.673
And if I'm doing it from fear, I give up the job

1235
00:51:24.673 --> 00:51:26.053
or I change.

1236
00:51:26.053 --> 00:51:28.833
Am I seeing this person because of duty and fear?

1237
00:51:28.833 --> 00:51:30.593
You know, they may not like me if I don't.

1238
00:51:30.593 --> 00:51:32.713
Or am I doing it out of love?

1239
00:51:32.713 --> 00:51:35.173
And I really work from that premise,

1240
00:51:35.173 --> 00:51:37.153
if I'm not doing it from love, I will be honest

1241
00:51:37.153 --> 00:51:38.913
with someone and say I don't think I should

1242
00:51:38.913 --> 00:51:41.233
be in a relationship with you because

1243
00:51:41.233 --> 00:51:42.793
I'm not doing it from a place I'd want

1244
00:51:42.793 --> 00:51:45.013
any relationship with you.

1245
00:51:45.013 --> 00:51:46.193
Until I can do it from love,

1246
00:51:46.193 --> 00:51:48.973
let's just call it a day at this moment.

1247
00:51:48.973 --> 00:51:51.753
And so intuition will always guide you

1248
00:51:51.753 --> 00:51:53.833
towards connection and love.

1249
00:51:53.833 --> 00:51:57.253
It does not make your life easy though, as you can hear.

1250
00:51:57.253 --> 00:51:59.973
It will often say hold you nose, jump.

1251
00:51:59.973 --> 00:52:01.633
(laughter)

1252
00:52:01.633 --> 00:52:03.673
And it doesn't mean, and commonly,

1253
00:52:03.673 --> 00:52:05.513
which is what I have some concern about the power

1254
00:52:05.513 --> 00:52:08.773
of intention, the power of intention often wants

1255
00:52:08.773 --> 00:52:11.153
to fix exactly what you want.

1256
00:52:11.153 --> 00:52:12.533
I want to be in control.

1257
00:52:12.533 --> 00:52:14.293
I want to make sure it doesn't hurt.

1258
00:52:14.293 --> 00:52:16.013
I want to make sure I've got money at the end of it.

1259
00:52:16.013 --> 00:52:17.173
I want to make sure I don't...

1260
00:52:17.173 --> 00:52:19.693
Intuition hasn't got an interest in that.

1261
00:52:19.693 --> 00:52:20.973
You see, it's heart based.

1262
00:52:20.973 --> 00:52:22.993
It says I can't promise you any of that,

1263
00:52:22.993 --> 00:52:26.233
but I can promise you you'll be connected to your soul.

1264
00:52:26.233 --> 00:52:30.673
And so intention without that soul connection,

1265
00:52:30.673 --> 00:52:32.813
you're going to always only create what will

1266
00:52:32.813 --> 00:52:35.053
keep you in a safe box,

1267
00:52:35.053 --> 00:52:37.333
but I hope that most of us are not the same

1268
00:52:37.333 --> 00:52:39.793
person we were a year ago or five years ago.

1269
00:52:39.793 --> 00:52:43.153
And we may not have been here had we not taken the risk.

1270
00:52:43.153 --> 00:52:45.473
So intuition says take a risk.

1271
00:52:45.473 --> 00:52:47.033
Take a risk in love.

1272
00:52:47.033 --> 00:52:49.613
Take a risk to step out for yourself.

1273
00:52:49.613 --> 00:52:52.893
<v Regina>Yes, so we need to really look at</v>

1274
00:52:52.893 --> 00:52:55.653
embracing those things, coming back to where

1275
00:52:55.653 --> 00:52:57.013
we were to begin with.

1276
00:52:57.013 --> 00:52:59.633
One of the best ways to take a moment to begin

1277
00:52:59.633 --> 00:53:02.533
checking in with ourselves is by something

1278
00:53:02.533 --> 00:53:05.953
that is irritating us on some level,

1279
00:53:05.953 --> 00:53:08.113
be it mental, emotional, physical.

1280
00:53:08.113 --> 00:53:10.513
So take these moments and maybe just

1281
00:53:10.513 --> 00:53:12.853
calm ourselves rather than buying into

1282
00:53:12.853 --> 00:53:16.233
the normal reaction and check inside.

1283
00:53:16.233 --> 00:53:18.313
Might that be the best beginning point for us?

1284
00:53:18.313 --> 00:53:22.053
<v ->It is, and then some of us who are always</v>

1285
00:53:22.053 --> 00:53:24.913
checking in inside need to not check in.

1286
00:53:24.913 --> 00:53:27.753
You know, we have to know ourselves sometimes.

1287
00:53:27.753 --> 00:53:30.113
We've always been listening inside,

1288
00:53:30.113 --> 00:53:31.453
analyzing what we're doing.

1289
00:53:31.453 --> 00:53:34.393
Sometimes, we have to be outrageous and spontaneous.

1290
00:53:34.393 --> 00:53:35.993
And went oops the bitch got out

1291
00:53:35.993 --> 00:53:37.493
(laughter)

1292
00:53:37.493 --> 00:53:39.913
because that may be the release we're waiting for.

1293
00:53:39.913 --> 00:53:42.533
So for some people who are more firey,

1294
00:53:42.533 --> 00:53:45.313
they need to do have to just hold their tongues,

1295
00:53:45.313 --> 00:53:46.893
but I've met some people who've held their tongues

1296
00:53:46.893 --> 00:53:49.553
so long, that hasn't helped them.

1297
00:53:49.553 --> 00:53:53.973
And so I do think yes, step back if you're always

1298
00:53:53.973 --> 00:53:57.493
a reactionary and just allow yourself to find a point

1299
00:53:57.493 --> 00:54:00.773
where you say is this the most effective use of my energy?

1300
00:54:00.773 --> 00:54:03.473
<v Regina>Yes, and if you're speaking from the heart,</v>

1301
00:54:03.473 --> 00:54:04.913
<v ->Yes, am I speaking from the heart?</v>

1302
00:54:04.913 --> 00:54:07.693
<v Regina>the other person, if you're in relationship</v>

1303
00:54:07.693 --> 00:54:10.473
to another person, in one of these situations,

1304
00:54:10.473 --> 00:54:13.673
people can hear the heart in a different way

1305
00:54:13.673 --> 00:54:16.373
than we can hear the mind and the history and the stories.

1306
00:54:16.373 --> 00:54:18.433
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

1307
00:54:18.433 --> 00:54:20.293
<v Regina>So we shouldn't be afraid?</v>

1308
00:54:20.293 --> 00:54:22.053
<v ->We shouldn't be and we should be good mirrors</v>

1309
00:54:22.053 --> 00:54:23.993
for each other in a loving way.

1310
00:54:23.993 --> 00:54:25.733
And it isn't about judgement.

1311
00:54:25.733 --> 00:54:27.753
It's about saying it feels that you've got a lot

1312
00:54:27.753 --> 00:54:29.373
of energy in what you're saying.

1313
00:54:29.373 --> 00:54:32.973
Maybe you want to look at that.

1314
00:54:32.973 --> 00:54:34.073
<v Regina>Well that is a beautiful</v>

1315
00:54:34.073 --> 00:54:35.593
and diplomatic way to put it.

1316
00:54:35.593 --> 00:54:36.553
(laughter)

1317
00:54:36.553 --> 00:54:38.633
Any final thoughts before we, I think we're gonna

1318
00:54:38.633 --> 00:54:40.013
be out of tape shortly here.

1319
00:54:40.013 --> 00:54:44.013
<v ->Yeah, I feel I've said what I wanted to share.</v>

1320
00:54:44.013 --> 00:54:45.373
Love the body.

1321
00:54:45.373 --> 00:54:46.953
Stay in the body.

1322
00:54:46.953 --> 00:54:48.913
I wanted to say that.

1323
00:54:48.913 --> 00:54:51.693
Too many meditations take people out of their body.

1324
00:54:51.693 --> 00:54:53.233
This is it.

1325
00:54:53.233 --> 00:54:55.093
On this earth is the best place you want to be.

1326
00:54:55.093 --> 00:54:57.093
You won the lottery to be here.

1327
00:54:57.093 --> 00:55:00.073
This is the place you want to be, not out of your body.

1328
00:55:00.073 --> 00:55:02.093
There is nowhere else.

1329
00:55:02.093 --> 00:55:03.333
Everything that you want to create,

1330
00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:04.353
you want to create here.

1331
00:55:04.353 --> 00:55:07.533
This is why we came here, to bring Heaven onto Earth.

1332
00:55:07.533 --> 00:55:10.673
And in the body, learning that the body

1333
00:55:10.673 --> 00:55:14.413
is the unique vessel it is, and that we're unique,

1334
00:55:14.413 --> 00:55:17.373
and we're not like anybody else,

1335
00:55:17.373 --> 00:55:19.373
and having the courage to be different.

1336
00:55:19.373 --> 00:55:21.193
I so commonly meet people who are saying

1337
00:55:21.193 --> 00:55:23.453
if I step out and I'm different, I'll be alone.

1338
00:55:23.453 --> 00:55:26.813
No, you're gonna be alone by not doing that

1339
00:55:26.813 --> 00:55:29.813
because when we send out the pulse of our soul,

1340
00:55:29.813 --> 00:55:32.033
we let people know our resonance.

1341
00:55:32.033 --> 00:55:35.153
We attract the people who can resonate with us, but

1342
00:55:35.153 --> 00:55:38.413
when we keep it hidden, we will find ourselves shut down.

1343
00:55:38.413 --> 00:55:40.733
So it's to become the unique individual you are

1344
00:55:40.733 --> 00:55:42.533
because we need everybody to remember

1345
00:55:42.533 --> 00:55:44.353
who they are at this moment because

1346
00:55:44.353 --> 00:55:47.133
each one of us has a part of the jigsaw.

1347
00:55:47.133 --> 00:55:49.853
Fortunately, none of us have it all,

1348
00:55:49.853 --> 00:55:52.473
and the only way we are going to ever find

1349
00:55:52.473 --> 00:55:54.393
the peace that we want on this planet,

1350
00:55:54.393 --> 00:55:56.873
and I'm not talking about a peace in passivity,

1351
00:55:56.873 --> 00:56:00.353
but a peace that means beyond all understanding.

1352
00:56:00.353 --> 00:56:03.413
The peace of the heart is when we actually appreciate,

1353
00:56:03.413 --> 00:56:05.773
respect, and honor everybody else that we meet

1354
00:56:05.773 --> 00:56:08.273
in our lives as another part of us.

1355
00:56:08.273 --> 00:56:12.073
<v Regina>So true, and so beautifully put.</v>

1356
00:56:12.073 --> 00:56:14.413
