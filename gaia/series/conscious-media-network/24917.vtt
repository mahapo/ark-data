00:00:00.627 --> 00:00:02.667
<v ->We once again had the opportunity to catch up</v>

2
00:00:02.667 --> 00:00:04.706
with Nick Begich for an update on some of

3
00:00:04.706 --> 00:00:06.778
the technologies on the horizon.

4
00:00:06.778 --> 00:00:09.017
In this interview Nick speaks further about

5
00:00:09.017 --> 00:00:11.424
the VeriChip and what that mean to our lives.

6
00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:14.714
He also shares information regarding quantum computing,

7
00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:17.895
a reality that, he says, is just around the corner.

8
00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:20.619
These two technologies not only will make us easy marks

9
00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.269
for influencing our consumer choices,

10
00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.798
but also have a much more insidious potential.

11
00:00:34.706 --> 00:00:36.026
<v Voiceover>I think it's very appropriate to keep up</v>

12
00:00:36.026 --> 00:00:37.945
the conversation about cell phones and really

13
00:00:37.945 --> 00:00:41.144
take it even deeper because it's becoming a big issue.

14
00:00:41.144 --> 00:00:43.933
I think all of us personally know people now,

15
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:46.436
multiple people, who have died of brain tumors.

16
00:00:46.436 --> 00:00:50.592
<v ->Right, in fact this is an ongoing controversy.</v>

17
00:00:50.654 --> 00:00:52.861
It started with, if you remember,

18
00:00:52.861 --> 00:00:55.839
the very first reports of brain tumors

19
00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:57.820
came out of Florida, Congress got involved,

20
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.750
they got very excited, they got Motorola and the industry

21
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.117
to actually fund a study that was over $25 million,

22
00:01:04.117 --> 00:01:07.636
five years, they hired Dr. George Carlo to conduct

23
00:01:07.636 --> 00:01:11.933
that study, and the odd thing was, they didn't put it,

24
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.348
you normally think about scientific studies, you're

25
00:01:13.348 --> 00:01:16.358
hooked up to engineering team or a scientific team,

26
00:01:16.358 --> 00:01:19.026
in this case they were connected to the chief lobbyists

27
00:01:19.026 --> 00:01:21.945
for the industry in Washington DC, because it really

28
00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:25.028
wasn't about science, it was about politics.

29
00:01:25.407 --> 00:01:28.839
What the industry did is, he spent five years,

30
00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:30.588
hired the best people in the world,

31
00:01:30.588 --> 00:01:32.848
put together his report, Motorola and others

32
00:01:32.848 --> 00:01:37.077
came out with that report saying, see, everything is safe,

33
00:01:37.077 --> 00:01:40.766
everything is wonderful, and Dr. Carlo, who is one of

34
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:44.184
my heroes, had the integrity to stand up and say, no,

35
00:01:44.184 --> 00:01:46.613
that is not what I said, and then he published a book

36
00:01:46.613 --> 00:01:49.415
called Cell Phones: Invisible Hazards.

37
00:01:49.415 --> 00:01:52.094
It actually lays out the framework for not just

38
00:01:52.094 --> 00:01:54.302
tumor formation, but the breakdown of

39
00:01:54.302 --> 00:01:57.933
the bloodâ€“brain barrier, he puts together a very good model

40
00:01:57.933 --> 00:02:00.711
that would explain what we're seeing in the research

41
00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:04.400
regarding the wireless world, particularly cell phones.

42
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.714
What we're going to see is something that goes far beyond

43
00:02:08.714 --> 00:02:10.924
what we saw in the tobacco industry, in terms of

44
00:02:10.924 --> 00:02:13.472
potential litigation in the future, particularly

45
00:02:13.472 --> 00:02:15.842
third party litigation, this is where employers,

46
00:02:15.842 --> 00:02:19.812
as a condition of employment, require their employees to use

47
00:02:19.812 --> 00:02:23.720
these phones consistently and constantly during the day.

48
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.651
Eventually that's going to probably breed some of

49
00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:28.029
the biggest worker's compensation cases,

50
00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:31.289
third party litigation because of the health effects

51
00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:33.096
that are being widely reported today.

52
00:02:33.096 --> 00:02:35.234
<v Voiceover>This begs the question, there are technologies</v>

53
00:02:35.234 --> 00:02:38.706
out there and you have basically put your stamp of approval

54
00:02:38.706 --> 00:02:41.294
on a couple of them, that start knocking out some of

55
00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:43.742
those frequencies, and certainly lessen the impact of

56
00:02:43.742 --> 00:02:46.021
cell phones, why would these companies

57
00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:49.425
not start investing hugely in these technologies?

58
00:02:49.425 --> 00:02:52.814
<v ->This is a great question because it's been asked before.</v>

59
00:02:52.814 --> 00:02:55.704
Right after Carlo came out with his report,

60
00:02:55.704 --> 00:02:59.052
at the last count, we found 12 US patents

61
00:02:59.052 --> 00:03:01.952
where the industry had in fact redesigned

62
00:03:01.952 --> 00:03:04.517
circuitry to be safer, although they still

63
00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.993
maintain they're perfectly safe.

64
00:03:06.993 --> 00:03:10.002
The thing is, if you acknowledge there's been a safety issue

65
00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:12.362
then you open the door immediately to

66
00:03:12.362 --> 00:03:14.601
the liability of everything that's happened before.

67
00:03:14.601 --> 00:03:17.190
This is something that we, as a public,

68
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.648
should get involved in because we need to provide

69
00:03:19.648 --> 00:03:22.858
a framework where industry, when the research comes out,

70
00:03:22.858 --> 00:03:25.657
that they can come forward and acknowledge it.

71
00:03:25.657 --> 00:03:27.286
As long as they're acknowledging the research

72
00:03:27.286 --> 00:03:30.115
we should limit their liability because they didn't do it,

73
00:03:30.115 --> 00:03:32.154
unless it's in bad faith like what we saw with

74
00:03:32.154 --> 00:03:33.895
the tobacco industry, where the science started to

75
00:03:33.895 --> 00:03:35.884
emerge and they suppressed that science.

76
00:03:35.884 --> 00:03:38.963
In that case, I say bankrupt the industry,

77
00:03:38.963 --> 00:03:41.173
if they hide that science, but if they're open,

78
00:03:41.173 --> 00:03:43.431
and they're honest, and they make those corrective moves

79
00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:45.831
there's lots that we can do but it requires a

80
00:03:45.831 --> 00:03:48.372
different kind of regulatory environment

81
00:03:48.372 --> 00:03:51.960
that encourages industry to be honest, to be upfront

82
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.919
and to take advantage of the kinds of principles applied

83
00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.039
in Europe, the precautionary principles, where when

84
00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:00.179
the information first starts to arise we alert

85
00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:02.379
the public, we take the appropriate actions

86
00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.127
and if we're wrong, there's nothing lost in that.

87
00:04:05.127 --> 00:04:07.927
But if we're right, there's everything gained by that.

88
00:04:07.927 --> 00:04:10.665
In the 30 years, plus, that the Europeans have applied

89
00:04:10.665 --> 00:04:13.424
this principle, in health and environmental issues,

90
00:04:13.424 --> 00:04:16.409
they have never once been wrong.

91
00:04:17.284 --> 00:04:18.273
<v Voiceover>Let's talk a little bit about</v>

92
00:04:18.273 --> 00:04:20.270
the Scandinavians cell study, just to give

93
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.077
a little more depth to the physical aspect.

94
00:04:23.077 --> 00:04:26.498
<v ->This is interesting, Nokia was ,really, the leader in</v>

95
00:04:26.498 --> 00:04:27.777
the first, and they're a Finnish company,

96
00:04:27.777 --> 00:04:30.156
everybody thinks they're a Japanese firm

97
00:04:30.156 --> 00:04:32.835
because of way they sound, but it's a Finnish company,

98
00:04:32.835 --> 00:04:35.973
so the Scandinavians had the longest historical use

99
00:04:35.973 --> 00:04:38.356
and you want to look at a population that has

100
00:04:38.356 --> 00:04:40.400
a reasonable number in the population across

101
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.858
those two economic boundaries, rural, urban,

102
00:04:44.858 --> 00:04:47.727
and for enough time, so there they had at least

103
00:04:47.727 --> 00:04:51.558
five, six years of pretty intense cell phone use

104
00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:54.066
when this study was done, and when this study was done

105
00:04:54.066 --> 00:04:57.445
it involved 15,000 people, which statistically is

106
00:04:57.445 --> 00:05:00.376
a very fine model, in fact a very good model,

107
00:05:00.376 --> 00:05:02.176
and in that they found that people that used

108
00:05:02.176 --> 00:05:06.035
the phones for over an hour a day,which is pretty routine

109
00:05:06.035 --> 00:05:08.992
these days, had a number of symptoms and the things

110
00:05:08.992 --> 00:05:11.290
they reported were widely reported was

111
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.122
heating behind the ears, first,

112
00:05:14.545 --> 00:05:18.281
short-term memory loss, appetite changes,

113
00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:21.990
sleep pattern disruptions, sex drive disruptions,

114
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.538
and those were the widest reported consequences.

115
00:05:26.538 --> 00:05:29.238
What they found in these studies it tended to be cumulative,

116
00:05:29.238 --> 00:05:32.086
the more you used it the more susceptible to this

117
00:05:32.086 --> 00:05:35.441
that you become, the more weakened your systems becomes.

118
00:05:36.028 --> 00:05:38.731
There's been other studies more recently,

119
00:05:39.547 --> 00:05:41.397
in fact there's a study ongoing right now,

120
00:05:41.397 --> 00:05:43.557
and it's scheduled to end in 25 years,

121
00:05:43.557 --> 00:05:46.375
which will be a little late, because by then

122
00:05:46.375 --> 00:05:48.614
this technology will have been replaced

123
00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:51.024
by who knows what in 25 years.

124
00:05:51.024 --> 00:05:55.168
That's almost like going back to the telegraph,

125
00:05:55.168 --> 00:05:57.738
it just doesn't work, but this is how they

126
00:05:57.738 --> 00:06:01.772
design these in the US and when you look at

127
00:06:01.964 --> 00:06:03.561
the things that are coming out more recently,

128
00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:08.371
last month we had the German Environmental Health Ministry

129
00:06:08.371 --> 00:06:11.978
came out and was giving warnings on wifi,

130
00:06:11.978 --> 00:06:14.868
saying that they are not going into public schools

131
00:06:14.868 --> 00:06:17.136
because of the risks associated with them,

132
00:06:17.136 --> 00:06:19.107
they have given the warning to the public

133
00:06:19.107 --> 00:06:22.418
that these things have potential risks,

134
00:06:22.418 --> 00:06:24.196
again under the precautionary principle,

135
00:06:24.196 --> 00:06:27.133
which has never been wrong, but Germans are not

136
00:06:27.133 --> 00:06:29.812
some slouch country, they are very--

137
00:06:29.812 --> 00:06:30.831
<v Voiceover>They're not sloppy in research.</v>

138
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:34.979
<v ->Very sophisticated, very thorough and precise</v>

139
00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:36.714
in their research, when the Germans say

140
00:06:36.714 --> 00:06:40.065
there's a problem, we better all be paying attention.

141
00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:43.083
The Swiss actually acknowledged this problem.

142
00:06:43.083 --> 00:06:45.802
Swiss Reinsurance, one of the biggest insurance groups

143
00:06:45.802 --> 00:06:48.002
in the world in terms of making recommendations to

144
00:06:48.002 --> 00:06:51.361
the insurance industry so they avoid troubled waters,

145
00:06:51.361 --> 00:06:53.542
and they wrote a publication, it's available on

146
00:06:53.542 --> 00:06:56.480
the internet, it's called electrosmog.

147
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.828
Electrosmog, as a concept when dealing with cell phones,

148
00:06:59.828 --> 00:07:03.419
what they said is, don't underwrite the risks

149
00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:06.917
of radiation or electromagnetic field effects,

150
00:07:06.917 --> 00:07:10.327
don't underwrite those risks because they believe

151
00:07:10.327 --> 00:07:13.156
it would bankrupt the insurance industry globally.

152
00:07:13.156 --> 00:07:15.784
<v Voiceover>In plain English, for anybody listening,</v>

153
00:07:15.784 --> 00:07:19.245
that means they find them simply too dangerous

154
00:07:19.245 --> 00:07:23.644
to underwrite because it's going to be absolute that

155
00:07:23.644 --> 00:07:25.683
they're going to have one lawsuit after another.

156
00:07:25.683 --> 00:07:27.922
<v ->They're convinced of it, and even Lloyds of London,</v>

157
00:07:27.922 --> 00:07:31.252
which will insure anything, won't insure cell phone

158
00:07:31.252 --> 00:07:34.321
radiation risk, and that should tell us something.

159
00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:36.571
If they won't take the financial risk

160
00:07:36.571 --> 00:07:38.629
why should we take the health risk?

161
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:41.149
We need to look at the ways to utilize cell phones

162
00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:44.958
in a more sensible way because they're not going away,

163
00:07:46.738 --> 00:07:49.542
but the wireless component is something that is

164
00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:51.830
going to become increasingly intrusive.

165
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.320
I think about my home environment

166
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.901
and within my home environment I have

167
00:07:55.901 --> 00:07:58.439
six wireless networks and none of them are mine

168
00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:00.918
but they all intrude upon my property

169
00:08:00.918 --> 00:08:03.755
and upon my airspace and upon my home.

170
00:08:03.755 --> 00:08:05.826
Do I have a right to sue my neighbors

171
00:08:05.826 --> 00:08:08.287
for inflicting that on me?

172
00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:11.756
When the science is in, I will

173
00:08:11.756 --> 00:08:14.821
because it's an intrusion on my personal space and my life.

174
00:08:14.821 --> 00:08:17.031
When you think about cell phone towers,

175
00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:18.990
and there's been research on this in Europe,

176
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.830
within 1,500 meters of cell phone towers,

177
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.917
they noted distinct changes in the genetic character

178
00:08:27.167 --> 00:08:31.406
of evolving embryos, now this was done animal species

179
00:08:31.406 --> 00:08:35.434
but genetics are genetics, what we're talking about here

180
00:08:35.434 --> 00:08:38.074
is manipulating genetic material in a way

181
00:08:38.074 --> 00:08:41.953
that causes deformation, now when you start to think about

182
00:08:41.953 --> 00:08:44.202
cell phones and cell phone use, it's not just

183
00:08:44.202 --> 00:08:45.932
the instrument you put on your head,

184
00:08:45.932 --> 00:08:48.460
it's the entire system of broadcasting

185
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:49.824
that we need to be concerned of, and then that

186
00:08:49.824 --> 00:08:51.754
extends into the wireless world

187
00:08:51.754 --> 00:08:53.793
and it also extends into the home portable phones

188
00:08:53.793 --> 00:08:55.803
which people generally don't even think about

189
00:08:55.803 --> 00:08:57.672
when they think about cell phone safety but

190
00:08:57.672 --> 00:09:01.114
the portable phones tend to be even more poorly designed,

191
00:09:01.114 --> 00:09:04.329
more poorly engineered, so they end up using energy

192
00:09:04.329 --> 00:09:07.201
much more inefficiently, which means that energy

193
00:09:07.201 --> 00:09:08.702
is transitting somewhere and a lot of it

194
00:09:08.702 --> 00:09:10.781
is transitted directly into your head.

195
00:09:10.781 --> 00:09:13.167
The other thing that's important is with children.

196
00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:16.238
With in adult, when you put it up to your head,

197
00:09:16.238 --> 00:09:18.518
you have a skull thickness and you have tissue that

198
00:09:18.518 --> 00:09:21.525
offer some resistance to the signal transfer,

199
00:09:21.525 --> 00:09:25.025
for the five year old, 400% more energy transfers into

200
00:09:25.025 --> 00:09:28.014
the brain because of skull thickness, than an adult.

201
00:09:28.014 --> 00:09:31.035
With a ten year old, 200% more energy transits into

202
00:09:31.035 --> 00:09:33.943
the brain, than an adult, so when you think about

203
00:09:33.943 --> 00:09:36.383
cell phones being marketed to children,

204
00:09:36.383 --> 00:09:39.473
it is not done in Europe, in most of the European countries,

205
00:09:39.473 --> 00:09:42.400
they don't put Mickey Mouse characters on cell phones.

206
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.031
In fact, in Great Britain every year in August,

207
00:09:46.031 --> 00:09:48.678
they warn families if your kids are under 16,

208
00:09:48.678 --> 00:09:51.299
try and avoid cell phones before they go back to school.

209
00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:52.928
These things aren't going away but at the same time

210
00:09:52.928 --> 00:09:56.745
there's gaining recognition that there is a problem.

211
00:09:57.217 --> 00:09:58.571
Hopefully the regulatory bodies

212
00:09:58.571 --> 00:10:00.229
at some point, will begin to address it.

213
00:10:00.229 --> 00:10:01.694
<v Voiceover>To what degrees</v>

214
00:10:02.716 --> 00:10:06.264
are those in the industry preemptively beginning

215
00:10:06.264 --> 00:10:09.471
to modernize the technologies where it is less dangerous?

216
00:10:09.471 --> 00:10:11.711
<v ->There are several things that have happened.</v>

217
00:10:16.544 --> 00:10:18.189
It's a question of how much intensity,

218
00:10:18.189 --> 00:10:20.829
just being here, in this space, we're being bombarded

219
00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:24.337
by electromagnetic fields that are effecting us,

220
00:10:24.337 --> 00:10:26.969
less so than placing something next to the head.

221
00:10:26.969 --> 00:10:28.243
When you place it next to the head

222
00:10:28.243 --> 00:10:30.064
because of the way energy transfers,

223
00:10:30.064 --> 00:10:32.903
it spreads out, the density of that energy spreads out

224
00:10:32.903 --> 00:10:35.921
very rapidly with distance, so if you could just get it

225
00:10:35.921 --> 00:10:38.331
a little ways away, you dramatically--

226
00:10:38.331 --> 00:10:39.395
<v Voiceover>Put it on speaker phone.</v>

227
00:10:39.395 --> 00:10:42.621
<v ->Exactly, and so many now have the speaker phone feature.</v>

228
00:10:42.621 --> 00:10:44.711
We already hear half of the conversation,

229
00:10:44.711 --> 00:10:46.078
what do you care if we hear the other half,

230
00:10:46.078 --> 00:10:48.118
in fact it makes it more interesting for the rest of us.

231
00:10:48.118 --> 00:10:49.819
(laughter)
So you hold the phone a little

232
00:10:49.819 --> 00:10:52.887
bit further away, it makes a huge difference.

233
00:10:52.887 --> 00:10:55.367
Don't put it next to your body where there's soft tissue,

234
00:10:55.367 --> 00:10:57.537
and you get deeper penetration and you effect kidneys,

235
00:10:57.537 --> 00:11:00.925
liver and so on, get the phone away from you.

236
00:11:00.925 --> 00:11:03.994
If you're carrying a purse, put it in the purse.

237
00:11:03.994 --> 00:11:08.124
If you're a male, try and figure out a way to not

238
00:11:08.124 --> 00:11:10.243
get it next to you.
<v Voiceover>Carry a man-bag.</v>

239
00:11:10.243 --> 00:11:11.893
<v ->Carry a man-bag, there you go.</v>

240
00:11:11.893 --> 00:11:14.023
(laughter)

241
00:11:14.943 --> 00:11:16.126
<v Voiceover>We're looking at some of the problems</v>

242
00:11:16.126 --> 00:11:18.205
and you were talking earlier about just

243
00:11:18.205 --> 00:11:20.386
the heating behind the ear, that sounds rather

244
00:11:20.386 --> 00:11:22.346
innocuous in and of itself, but it's not.

245
00:11:22.346 --> 00:11:24.596
It's the heating that is actually at issue, isn't it?

246
00:11:24.596 --> 00:11:26.574
<v ->The heating, what it does, is it breaks down</v>

247
00:11:26.574 --> 00:11:28.534
the blood-brain barrier because that heating

248
00:11:28.534 --> 00:11:30.704
also transfers into the brain, in fact,

249
00:11:30.704 --> 00:11:32.293
when you're using a cell phone, and I've seen

250
00:11:32.293 --> 00:11:36.164
the images, where they actually show the heating.

251
00:11:36.164 --> 00:11:39.941
What happens is that heating moves through the skull

252
00:11:39.941 --> 00:11:42.231
into the brain, breaks down the blood-brain barrier,

253
00:11:42.231 --> 00:11:46.340
also slows the repair of DNA, and this normal, natural

254
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.579
repair process is slowed down,

255
00:11:48.579 --> 00:11:51.600
this is the mechanism that Carlo, theoretically believes,

256
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.378
that this is the mechanism that is the trigger

257
00:11:54.378 --> 00:11:58.038
for tumor formation, which actually does make good sense.

258
00:11:58.038 --> 00:12:00.358
It also makes sense of why it would confuse

259
00:12:00.358 --> 00:12:03.125
things like appetite, sleep rhythms, and so on,

260
00:12:03.125 --> 00:12:06.345
because you're transferring toxins, then, into the brain,

261
00:12:06.345 --> 00:12:08.465
short-term memory gets explained, a lot of this

262
00:12:08.465 --> 00:12:10.254
starts to make a lot more sense.

263
00:12:10.254 --> 00:12:11.773
The other interesting thing is

264
00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:13.973
when your friends start dying of tumors

265
00:12:13.973 --> 00:12:15.788
look at which side they held their phone on

266
00:12:15.788 --> 00:12:17.286
because we traditionally hold the phone

267
00:12:17.286 --> 00:12:19.827
on one side or the other and that's where they show up.

268
00:12:19.827 --> 00:12:22.546
You're going to see the busiest people in the world,

269
00:12:22.546 --> 00:12:24.425
the Johnnie Cochrans of the world

270
00:12:24.425 --> 00:12:27.776
who are busy and on that phone six, eight hours a day

271
00:12:27.776 --> 00:12:30.762
and those are going to be the first fallen

272
00:12:31.103 --> 00:12:33.814
in this thing, it's going to be the people that

273
00:12:33.814 --> 00:12:36.761
we probably really need for their intellectual capacity

274
00:12:36.761 --> 00:12:38.699
because they tend to be the busiest people in the world,

275
00:12:38.699 --> 00:12:41.997
tend to use them the most and we really need to think about

276
00:12:42.448 --> 00:12:45.157
how we use our technology and how to better utilize it so we

277
00:12:45.157 --> 00:12:49.638
can avoid some of the downfalls of these two-edged swords.

278
00:12:49.638 --> 00:12:51.038
<v Voiceover>Looking at cell phone technology</v>

279
00:12:51.038 --> 00:12:53.557
in terms of some of the more nefarious uses of it,

280
00:12:53.557 --> 00:12:56.066
yesterday I heard you talking about the roving wiretap.

281
00:12:56.066 --> 00:12:58.110
<v ->Roving wiretaps,</v>

282
00:12:58.444 --> 00:13:00.150
there was a test case that actually went to

283
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.491
the US Supreme Court and it was a case in New York

284
00:13:02.491 --> 00:13:07.268
where they had taped conversations of mafioso,

285
00:13:07.268 --> 00:13:09.674
and using and prosecuting them, and they wanted

286
00:13:09.674 --> 00:13:11.354
that evidence thrown out because the way

287
00:13:11.354 --> 00:13:13.822
the roving wiretap worked is, for instance,

288
00:13:13.822 --> 00:13:15.393
if you wanted to tap a conversation

289
00:13:15.393 --> 00:13:18.363
in a restaurant, you could literally go in,

290
00:13:18.363 --> 00:13:21.261
from a distance activate all of the cell phones

291
00:13:21.261 --> 00:13:23.660
within that restaurant by downloading just a bit

292
00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:27.240
of software to them remotely, activate them

293
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.338
and they act as a microphone in the room

294
00:13:29.338 --> 00:13:30.410
<v Voiceover>Even if they're turned off?</v>

295
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.618
<v ->Even if they're turned off, and they can pick up</v>

296
00:13:32.618 --> 00:13:35.089
all of the conversations within a given space

297
00:13:35.089 --> 00:13:36.925
so even if theses guys are smart enough

298
00:13:36.925 --> 00:13:39.964
to remove the battery, it's the guy next to him at

299
00:13:39.964 --> 00:13:41.894
the table one over, you know, that's got

300
00:13:41.894 --> 00:13:44.222
the phone laying on the table or sitting in their jacket,

301
00:13:44.222 --> 00:13:46.773
but the idea is, with a roving wiretap,

302
00:13:46.773 --> 00:13:48.581
when they first came out people thought,

303
00:13:48.581 --> 00:13:49.802
well what does that mean, they just go through

304
00:13:49.802 --> 00:13:52.081
a neighborhood and randomly check phone lines?

305
00:13:52.081 --> 00:13:54.790
It was kind of confusing and then this lawsuit came out

306
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:59.489
and they won, the mafia didn't get the evidence thrown out,

307
00:13:59.489 --> 00:14:01.945
they went to jail because the evidence stayed in.

308
00:14:01.945 --> 00:14:03.537
<v Voiceover>No warrant for any of this,</v>

309
00:14:03.537 --> 00:14:04.503
or was there in this case?
<v Nick>They had a warrant</v>

310
00:14:04.503 --> 00:14:05.563
for the wiretap in this case but

311
00:14:05.563 --> 00:14:06.590
it was just an unusual
<v Voiceover>For this case.</v>

312
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.264
<v Nick>mechanism for utilizing</v>

313
00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:09.420
because we don't always think of a bug

314
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.988
and you can go in and do a bug sweep.

315
00:14:10.988 --> 00:14:12.518
But when you're doing a bug sweep

316
00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:14.587
and you're looking at the frequency bands

317
00:14:14.587 --> 00:14:16.858
and you see a cell phone bandwidth

318
00:14:16.858 --> 00:14:18.978
assigned by the Department of Commerce,

319
00:14:18.978 --> 00:14:20.396
you look at that and you go, well those are just

320
00:14:20.396 --> 00:14:22.752
cell phones so you ignore it

321
00:14:22.752 --> 00:14:24.620
but the microphone is still there.

322
00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.459
You think about it on OnStar on your car,

323
00:14:26.459 --> 00:14:29.267
as another example of this, and the voice you call,

324
00:14:29.267 --> 00:14:30.877
you call them up, well how do you know

325
00:14:30.877 --> 00:14:32.637
they didn't turn it on?

326
00:14:32.637 --> 00:14:34.585
Who do you know is activating that system,

327
00:14:34.585 --> 00:14:37.715
do you really want every move you make tracked?

328
00:14:37.715 --> 00:14:40.184
I personally find that offensive.

329
00:14:40.184 --> 00:14:45.184
The whole idea of the convenience in trading for your

330
00:14:45.271 --> 00:14:48.619
safety and security, and this is always the content

331
00:14:48.619 --> 00:14:51.408
of the argument, well don't you want to be safe,

332
00:14:51.408 --> 00:14:53.218
don't you want to be secure, and they use fear

333
00:14:53.218 --> 00:14:56.108
to motivate you to accept a lowering and lowering

334
00:14:56.108 --> 00:14:57.937
of your standards of what is acceptable

335
00:14:57.937 --> 00:15:00.307
in a civil society, and these are just

336
00:15:00.307 --> 00:15:03.223
small examples of it, but I think a lot of it

337
00:15:03.223 --> 00:15:06.593
has to do with the general convenience of

338
00:15:06.593 --> 00:15:09.952
the device, people will let that other stuff go

339
00:15:09.952 --> 00:15:12.870
because all of us knows it's built in now.

340
00:15:13.249 --> 00:15:15.027
Most people just don't think about it.

341
00:15:15.027 --> 00:15:17.080
<v Voiceover>Not only that, but there's a conversion over</v>

342
00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.946
from landlines that, as you were also stating yesterday,

343
00:15:19.946 --> 00:15:23.716
some 20% of the people don't bother with landlines anymore

344
00:15:23.716 --> 00:15:25.736
so some conversion had to be made if you're going

345
00:15:25.736 --> 00:15:28.144
to continue to be intrusive.

346
00:15:28.144 --> 00:15:30.685
<v ->Right, landlines are interesting because</v>

347
00:15:30.685 --> 00:15:32.524
the dropping of landlines generally

348
00:15:32.524 --> 00:15:36.273
and going to cell phone offers a lot of things

349
00:15:36.273 --> 00:15:38.478
from a marketing and from a political perspective

350
00:15:38.478 --> 00:15:41.821
because now you have a unique identifier

351
00:15:41.821 --> 00:15:44.455
that's connected to a unique individual.

352
00:15:44.455 --> 00:15:49.134
RadioShack, in our community, won't charge up phones

353
00:15:49.134 --> 00:15:51.006
unless you do it on a credit card,

354
00:15:51.006 --> 00:15:53.744
they won't take case and they won't take checks

355
00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:55.804
because they also want to know who charged

356
00:15:55.804 --> 00:15:59.132
that phone up, who's paying for the phone use.

357
00:15:59.132 --> 00:16:01.643
Which is an interesting thing because, again,

358
00:16:01.643 --> 00:16:04.501
why isn't US currency good at a RadioShack

359
00:16:04.501 --> 00:16:06.071
for cell phone minutes?

360
00:16:06.071 --> 00:16:08.500
<v Voiceover>Talk about more insidious data mining.</v>

361
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.441
<v ->Exactly, so you start to look at it,</v>

362
00:16:10.441 --> 00:16:12.880
and you say, okay, 20% of the population eventually,

363
00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.360
as children grow up, they're not going to get landlines.

364
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.439
They're going to look at it like,

365
00:16:17.439 --> 00:16:19.966
like my son when I tried to explain what a typewriter was

366
00:16:19.966 --> 00:16:22.918
and I said, well, it's a computer keyboard without a screen

367
00:16:22.918 --> 00:16:25.565
and his response was, that'll never work.

368
00:16:25.565 --> 00:16:26.925
(laughter)

369
00:16:26.925 --> 00:16:28.706
Landlines are going the same way,

370
00:16:28.706 --> 00:16:31.414
as this relationship to cell phones and when you think about

371
00:16:31.414 --> 00:16:35.504
the cell phone, it identifies you when you travel around

372
00:16:35.504 --> 00:16:38.002
because it has built-in features.

373
00:16:38.002 --> 00:16:40.848
Every time you make a call, where you were

374
00:16:40.848 --> 00:16:43.487
is also recorded, not just, you made the call,

375
00:16:43.487 --> 00:16:45.436
and who you called and what time it was,

376
00:16:45.436 --> 00:16:48.225
but where you physically were is stored

377
00:16:48.225 --> 00:16:51.213
because it's triangulated between the cell phone towers.

378
00:16:51.213 --> 00:16:53.773
So you're movements are traced as well

379
00:16:53.773 --> 00:16:55.703
and when you start to think about this,

380
00:16:55.703 --> 00:16:57.692
one of the things that's forecasted

381
00:16:57.692 --> 00:17:00.822
because the cell phone is unique enough to use

382
00:17:00.822 --> 00:17:04.151
so that as data mining occurs where lots of information

383
00:17:04.151 --> 00:17:06.889
is collated about individuals, and then you walk by

384
00:17:06.889 --> 00:17:09.950
the electronic billboard down the street

385
00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:11.859
and you're carrying your cell phone and the billboard

386
00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:15.207
recognizes you personally because of that cell phone

387
00:17:15.207 --> 00:17:18.399
and then based upon your entire profile,

388
00:17:18.399 --> 00:17:20.857
starts pitching the advertising messages

389
00:17:20.857 --> 00:17:23.485
that you're most likely to respond to.

390
00:17:23.485 --> 00:17:25.375
<v Voiceover>How far away is that?</v>

391
00:17:25.375 --> 00:17:27.164
<v ->We're very close, I say within the next</v>

392
00:17:27.164 --> 00:17:28.636
three to five years you're going to begin to see

393
00:17:28.636 --> 00:17:30.883
some of this technology commercially applied--

394
00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.254
<v Voiceover>You're going to be more stimulated</v>

395
00:17:32.254 --> 00:17:34.203
as you walk through life because you're going to be

396
00:17:34.203 --> 00:17:37.042
pitched with exactly what your desires want, right?

397
00:17:37.042 --> 00:17:39.949
<v ->Right, exactly right, the other part of this is</v>

398
00:17:39.949 --> 00:17:42.487
from a political perspective when you think about

399
00:17:42.487 --> 00:17:45.028
tailored messages based on data mining

400
00:17:45.028 --> 00:17:46.987
what is really important about this is

401
00:17:46.987 --> 00:17:48.816
you could have a political candidate that has

402
00:17:48.816 --> 00:17:53.116
10 major issues, and nine of them you are 100% against,

403
00:17:53.116 --> 00:17:55.316
and one of them you are 100% for,

404
00:17:55.316 --> 00:17:57.712
he's going to isolate which of those issues you're

405
00:17:57.712 --> 00:18:00.919
in favor of and those are the only messages

406
00:18:00.919 --> 00:18:04.340
you're ever going to get from that candidate directly,

407
00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:08.869
either by mail or by the push polls, or whatever mechanism

408
00:18:08.869 --> 00:18:11.626
so that they can manipulate you into believing that

409
00:18:11.626 --> 00:18:14.091
this person resonates with your same belief system

410
00:18:14.091 --> 00:18:15.981
when 90% of their agenda is something

411
00:18:15.981 --> 00:18:18.461
you would fight vigorously against.

412
00:18:18.461 --> 00:18:20.879
That's the manipulation that occurs with

413
00:18:20.879 --> 00:18:23.270
data mining whether it's for political purposes,

414
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.099
the same thing can be used commercially

415
00:18:25.099 --> 00:18:28.475
when you isolate where a person's general pattern

416
00:18:28.475 --> 00:18:30.555
of existence is and you can narrow it down,

417
00:18:30.555 --> 00:18:32.885
when you start to look at larger and larger populations,

418
00:18:32.885 --> 00:18:37.324
you can draw some very important analysis

419
00:18:37.324 --> 00:18:39.254
from that, from a marketing perspective.

420
00:18:39.254 --> 00:18:42.003
That's why Google is becoming so important

421
00:18:42.003 --> 00:18:44.391
because they're collecting all of that data

422
00:18:44.391 --> 00:18:48.013
which is allowing for a honing of marketing.

423
00:18:48.611 --> 00:18:50.312
The idea of all of the interconnections

424
00:18:50.312 --> 00:18:51.951
and how a person views the world can

425
00:18:51.951 --> 00:18:56.163
be deduced from these kinds of oh-ven-gence.

426
00:18:56.163 --> 00:18:58.141
All that data is stored because it's the data

427
00:18:58.141 --> 00:19:00.573
that's valuable, even though we may not have

428
00:19:00.573 --> 00:19:04.081
the capacity today to sort all that data,

429
00:19:04.081 --> 00:19:06.979
that is coming and it's coming extremely rapidly.

430
00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:10.258
Storing it is relatively easy and because it is so cheap

431
00:19:10.258 --> 00:19:14.974
to store vast amounts of data,virtually all data is stored.

432
00:19:14.974 --> 00:19:17.664
<v Voiceover>But processing it is becoming, also,</v>

433
00:19:17.664 --> 00:19:19.724
another game that's increasing very rapidly.

434
00:19:19.724 --> 00:19:21.143
<v ->Oh yes, this is very important because it's</v>

435
00:19:21.143 --> 00:19:23.174
the quantum computing area and we've

436
00:19:23.174 --> 00:19:26.741
talked about that in the past but quantum computing,

437
00:19:26.741 --> 00:19:29.351
and I'll use this analogy because it's a good one,

438
00:19:29.351 --> 00:19:31.071
and it was one that was in an article discussing

439
00:19:31.071 --> 00:19:33.166
the super computer that just had broke the record

440
00:19:33.166 --> 00:19:38.166
in 2006 for speeds and it was 280 teraflops per second

441
00:19:39.524 --> 00:19:41.815
which doesn't mean anything to most people (laughs) in

442
00:19:41.815 --> 00:19:44.414
the world but what is, is the equivalent of

443
00:19:44.414 --> 00:19:47.986
6.6 billion people, with a hand calculator,

444
00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:50.812
each of them every five seconds doing a calculation

445
00:19:50.812 --> 00:19:55.161
for 60 hours and all those 6.6 billion calculators,

446
00:19:55.161 --> 00:19:57.611
every five seconds for 60 hours equal what a

447
00:19:57.611 --> 00:20:01.512
super computer today does in one second.

448
00:20:01.905 --> 00:20:04.331
That's an amazing thing, when you think about it,

449
00:20:04.331 --> 00:20:07.549
but a neuron firing chain in the human brain

450
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:10.860
requires a three dimensional MRI that requires

451
00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.107
three super computers tied together,

452
00:20:14.107 --> 00:20:16.477
just to get one neuron firing in the brain.

453
00:20:16.477 --> 00:20:20.825
Now, wrapping your head around that for a minute,

454
00:20:20.825 --> 00:20:24.035
and then think about that super computer of today

455
00:20:24.035 --> 00:20:28.477
running for an hour, now that's a phenomenal thing,

456
00:20:31.313 --> 00:20:34.342
excuse me, let me change this, that super computer

457
00:20:34.342 --> 00:20:37.126
running for a trillion years,

458
00:20:37.672 --> 00:20:38.934
I just told you what it does in a second,

459
00:20:38.934 --> 00:20:42.253
a trillion years of operating, a quantum computer

460
00:20:42.253 --> 00:20:44.892
in one hour will do what a trillion years

461
00:20:44.892 --> 00:20:47.594
of today's super computer will do.

462
00:20:47.594 --> 00:20:51.927
Quantum computing is the idea on atomic level,

463
00:20:51.927 --> 00:20:55.828
on a very small level, manipulating information

464
00:20:55.828 --> 00:21:00.828
and on that level, the operator influences the outcome,

465
00:21:01.997 --> 00:21:04.506
you know this idea in physics, the observer influences

466
00:21:04.506 --> 00:21:07.196
whether it's a particle or a wave, well this is a problem

467
00:21:07.196 --> 00:21:10.805
in quantum computing that was resolved earlier this year

468
00:21:10.805 --> 00:21:12.954
because they figured out how to electromagentically

469
00:21:12.954 --> 00:21:16.015
shield a quantum computer so you could develop

470
00:21:16.015 --> 00:21:19.254
this technology, so from this point forward

471
00:21:19.254 --> 00:21:22.853
we're going to see accelerated advances.

472
00:21:22.853 --> 00:21:24.893
The other thing that we've seen in speeds

473
00:21:24.893 --> 00:21:28.612
are things like optical microcircuits that work on

474
00:21:28.612 --> 00:21:30.702
light rather than electrons, which is a

475
00:21:30.702 --> 00:21:33.409
much, much faster medium.

476
00:21:33.749 --> 00:21:35.788
When you start to think about light circuits,

477
00:21:35.788 --> 00:21:38.467
that's another major area that will probably be

478
00:21:38.467 --> 00:21:40.997
a step in between the quantum computing set.

479
00:21:40.997 --> 00:21:42.815
But these things are coming,

480
00:21:42.815 --> 00:21:45.457
super conductivity feeds into this, as well,

481
00:21:45.457 --> 00:21:49.075
because when you reduce the resistance down to zero

482
00:21:49.075 --> 00:21:53.073
then you have these incredible speeds

483
00:21:53.073 --> 00:21:55.840
of transmitting information and computing that information

484
00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:00.007
It's, sort of, this coalescing of technologies

485
00:22:00.007 --> 00:22:03.006
taking place right now, quantum computing is going to

486
00:22:03.006 --> 00:22:04.936
be here in the next couple of years

487
00:22:04.936 --> 00:22:07.877
and the day it arrives, whoever gets there first,

488
00:22:07.877 --> 00:22:10.295
every security system in the world

489
00:22:10.295 --> 00:22:12.145
is then vulnerable to hacking.

490
00:22:12.145 --> 00:22:14.265
With enough persistence you hack through them all,

491
00:22:14.265 --> 00:22:17.865
well imagine that super computer

492
00:22:17.865 --> 00:22:20.820
of tomorrow, that quantum computer

493
00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.089
being able to hack through, the interesting thing is,

494
00:22:23.089 --> 00:22:26.269
every human brain is a quantum computer.

495
00:22:26.269 --> 00:22:28.429
We already have that capacity, we just

496
00:22:28.429 --> 00:22:30.748
haven't figure out how to fully access it.

497
00:22:30.748 --> 00:22:33.750
It's kind of like man always trying to replicate

498
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:36.387
what The Creator has already done,

499
00:22:36.387 --> 00:22:38.536
and we always do it with a big hammer

500
00:22:38.536 --> 00:22:40.924
and we only need a feather and we don't

501
00:22:40.924 --> 00:22:44.254
quite figure that out but nonetheless

502
00:22:44.254 --> 00:22:46.003
the human brain is capable of doing much more

503
00:22:46.003 --> 00:22:49.424
than we think and that's where I believe

504
00:22:49.424 --> 00:22:51.180
the real action will come because as these

505
00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.740
other technologies emerge, on one side materially,

506
00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.893
the human consciousness also changes materially.

507
00:22:58.893 --> 00:23:00.922
<v Voiceover>It's interesting because the quantum computer</v>

508
00:23:00.922 --> 00:23:03.434
you're talking about, and it's capabilities are,

509
00:23:03.434 --> 00:23:07.251
they were written about by Michio Kaku in his book Visions,

510
00:23:07.251 --> 00:23:09.294
about 10 years ago, but it seems to me we

511
00:23:09.294 --> 00:23:11.304
are way ahead of schedule because I think he had

512
00:23:11.304 --> 00:23:14.514
projected that out for something, like, 2050 when

513
00:23:14.514 --> 00:23:18.095
this would become a useful reality.

514
00:23:19.063 --> 00:23:21.944
<v ->That's not unusual to see those predictions</v>

515
00:23:21.944 --> 00:23:25.471
far into the future, there was one on SPACECAST 2020

516
00:23:25.471 --> 00:23:26.943
making predictions about being able

517
00:23:26.943 --> 00:23:29.881
to send voice information into someone's head,

518
00:23:29.881 --> 00:23:33.320
and actually that was done at MIT,

519
00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.948
Lemelson Prize was awarded to Woody Norris,

520
00:23:35.948 --> 00:23:40.198
who did that in 2005, 15 years ahead of schedule.

521
00:23:40.198 --> 00:23:41.960
These schedules are really irrelevant

522
00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.898
because what happens as computing power increases,

523
00:23:44.898 --> 00:23:49.885
back in the 1980's, we were doubling our knowledge

524
00:23:49.885 --> 00:23:51.282
base from the invention of the wheel

525
00:23:51.282 --> 00:23:54.247
to where we are today about every five years.

526
00:23:54.666 --> 00:23:57.116
Back around the very beginning of this century,

527
00:23:57.116 --> 00:24:00.113
around 2000, it was about every nine to 10 months,

528
00:24:00.113 --> 00:24:02.525
now it's about every seven to six months

529
00:24:02.525 --> 00:24:04.645
and getting shorter and shorter and shorter.

530
00:24:04.645 --> 00:24:08.343
With quantum computing it will be almost every day

531
00:24:08.343 --> 00:24:10.441
we will double the knowledge of human beings

532
00:24:10.441 --> 00:24:13.560
with quantum computing, at that rate there's no way

533
00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.119
to analyze the implications of any of those changes

534
00:24:17.119 --> 00:24:19.520
we will just be in this rush, and the thing about

535
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.439
quantum computing, the machines will be incredible,

536
00:24:22.439 --> 00:24:23.919
they'll almost be miraculous because of

537
00:24:23.919 --> 00:24:27.678
their predictive capacity to predict future events

538
00:24:27.678 --> 00:24:30.306
based upon huge bodies of input

539
00:24:30.306 --> 00:24:32.767
and we'll begin to rely on them significantly

540
00:24:32.767 --> 00:24:34.796
in making decisions, and the problem with

541
00:24:34.796 --> 00:24:38.696
quantum computing is it will never absolutely be perfect.

542
00:24:38.696 --> 00:24:41.056
So you get a butterfly effect in the programming

543
00:24:41.056 --> 00:24:44.764
that over time they become less and less reliable.

544
00:24:44.764 --> 00:24:46.313
<v Voiceover>When we have this capacity,</v>

545
00:24:46.313 --> 00:24:48.142
already, innately.
<v Nick>Already.</v>

546
00:24:48.142 --> 00:24:51.010
Absolutely, and this is where the parallel is,

547
00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:53.556
in my view, is as we learn more about the brain,

548
00:24:53.556 --> 00:24:55.326
as we learn more about the mind

549
00:24:55.326 --> 00:25:00.074
and we begin to open up our own potentials,

550
00:25:00.074 --> 00:25:02.513
we're going to look back on this period

551
00:25:02.513 --> 00:25:04.214
100 years from now and be laughing

552
00:25:04.214 --> 00:25:05.945
about what we were doing, in the same way

553
00:25:05.945 --> 00:25:08.293
that we look back 100 years ago at

554
00:25:08.293 --> 00:25:10.511
the thoughts and science of then.

555
00:25:10.511 --> 00:25:12.972
It's not going to be any different.

556
00:25:12.972 --> 00:25:14.841
I think the biggest concern is,

557
00:25:14.841 --> 00:25:16.411
from my perspective, is you look at the mind

558
00:25:16.411 --> 00:25:18.629
and you look at the brain and what's emerging

559
00:25:18.629 --> 00:25:21.130
in that whole area of neuroscience,

560
00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:25.340
the biggest challenges for civil liberties are at stake

561
00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.249
because the domain of the mind

562
00:25:27.249 --> 00:25:30.195
is the connection to whatever you believe

563
00:25:30.195 --> 00:25:33.399
the soul to be connected to, whatever you believe,

564
00:25:33.399 --> 00:25:36.889
it's our control station for this,

565
00:25:36.889 --> 00:25:39.128
and our link to what else is out there

566
00:25:39.128 --> 00:25:41.996
and the fact that anyone believes that they should

567
00:25:41.996 --> 00:25:44.657
be able to manipulate activity within

568
00:25:44.657 --> 00:25:47.528
our brains, for any other purpose,

569
00:25:47.528 --> 00:25:51.388
PBS just did a piece called The 22nd Century

570
00:25:51.388 --> 00:25:54.998
and their opening segment was the World Wide Mind

571
00:25:54.998 --> 00:25:57.568
where they believe that like we had the internet of

572
00:25:57.568 --> 00:26:00.615
the 1990s, that we will have a network where every

573
00:26:00.615 --> 00:26:03.654
human brain on the planet will be connected.

574
00:26:03.654 --> 00:26:06.411
I don't like that because, first of all,

575
00:26:07.365 --> 00:26:09.630
artificially doing this means that

576
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:12.029
the manipulation of all those human brains

577
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:16.399
is also possible and being able to project propaganda into

578
00:26:16.399 --> 00:26:19.371
those brains is also possible in lots of different ways.

579
00:26:19.371 --> 00:26:22.748
PBS's suggesting that this is where it's headed.

580
00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:25.653
My view is, we already have this capacity,

581
00:26:25.653 --> 00:26:27.383
we are already connected in this way

582
00:26:27.383 --> 00:26:29.871
we just don't recognize that connection.

583
00:26:29.871 --> 00:26:31.942
The science is beginning to show this.

584
00:26:31.942 --> 00:26:34.110
What we don't need is an artificial system

585
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:37.000
that there is an operator on that has

586
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.345
the determinative ability to influence

587
00:26:39.345 --> 00:26:42.696
human mind, human behavior, when you think about

588
00:26:42.696 --> 00:26:46.559
reliance on electronics, everyone,

589
00:26:46.964 --> 00:26:50.510
the generation coming up now are so different

590
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:53.467
from you and I in terms of how they view the world,

591
00:26:53.467 --> 00:26:56.887
it's the gadgetry but when you look

592
00:26:58.226 --> 00:26:59.578
across the world and you look at who is

593
00:26:59.578 --> 00:27:01.548
the most powerful on the planet,

594
00:27:01.548 --> 00:27:03.796
it's those with the highest capacity

595
00:27:03.796 --> 00:27:06.606
to control and command technologies.

596
00:27:06.606 --> 00:27:08.736
Within democratic republics like ours

597
00:27:08.736 --> 00:27:10.954
it means that we all have to have at least

598
00:27:10.954 --> 00:27:12.815
a working conceptual knowledge.

599
00:27:12.815 --> 00:27:13.932
We don't all have to know how to put

600
00:27:13.932 --> 00:27:15.939
the stuff together but we ought to know

601
00:27:15.939 --> 00:27:17.400
what it does, we ought to consider

602
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.949
the ethical and moral implications of it

603
00:27:19.949 --> 00:27:21.930
and have an opportunity to debate that

604
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.817
within the public forum and make sure that technologies

605
00:27:24.817 --> 00:27:27.936
serve humankind's interest, rather than work against us.

606
00:27:29.986 --> 00:27:31.670
<v Voiceover>Perfectly put.</v>

607
00:27:33.283 --> 00:27:35.973
This is, I wouldn't say it's off topic,

608
00:27:35.973 --> 00:27:38.042
but we might need to find a segue here.

609
00:27:38.042 --> 00:27:40.980
Naomi Watts wrote an article recently, I think it was called

610
00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.620
The Tears of Americans, or something,

611
00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.710
as she's out speaking she's noticing that

612
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:46.480
people are coming up to her and saying,

613
00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.279
my god what can we do, I'd love to be able to speak up,

614
00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:51.609
I'd love to defend what I think is right

615
00:27:51.609 --> 00:27:54.608
but I'm so afraid They're watching me.

616
00:27:54.608 --> 00:27:58.182
We know it's not plausible to watch every human being

617
00:27:58.182 --> 00:28:01.242
but on the other hand the people who are aware of

618
00:28:01.242 --> 00:28:05.030
all of this are becoming deeply emotionally

619
00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:09.665
depressed over the loss of their autonomy

620
00:28:09.665 --> 00:28:12.476
and being able to speak out.

621
00:28:12.476 --> 00:28:14.970
Any thoughts on this because this is,

622
00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:16.820
valid or not, it's mass.

623
00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.558
<v ->When people have this,</v>

624
00:28:18.558 --> 00:28:21.608
and I see it too, in a lot of my travels,

625
00:28:21.608 --> 00:28:23.898
the injection of fear into populations

626
00:28:23.898 --> 00:28:26.447
is one of the roots to control the populations,

627
00:28:26.447 --> 00:28:29.058
it always has been because what happens if you look at

628
00:28:29.058 --> 00:28:32.195
the brain, in an EEG, where you're actually measuring

629
00:28:32.195 --> 00:28:35.056
brain activity and you look at people experiencing fear

630
00:28:35.056 --> 00:28:37.946
you get incoherent brain patterns, they're all over the map

631
00:28:37.946 --> 00:28:41.723
and they tend to be in the higher beta ranges and above.

632
00:28:41.723 --> 00:28:44.363
They're the kind of signals that don't allow

633
00:28:44.363 --> 00:28:47.450
for intellectual, higher order thinking.

634
00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:49.791
What you need is to slow the brain down,

635
00:28:49.791 --> 00:28:52.649
to relax, and often what happens with activists,

636
00:28:52.649 --> 00:28:55.488
and see this all the time, they see the issue,

637
00:28:55.488 --> 00:28:58.639
they see the goal, but instead of recognizing

638
00:28:58.639 --> 00:29:01.428
their immediate spheres of influence,

639
00:29:01.428 --> 00:29:03.006
which is where we should start,

640
00:29:03.006 --> 00:29:05.006
they stretch beyond it, and when they do

641
00:29:05.006 --> 00:29:07.136
they're in an unstable position

642
00:29:07.136 --> 00:29:10.036
because they're not able to carry the message forward.

643
00:29:10.036 --> 00:29:12.284
We all have a part to play, we all have

644
00:29:12.284 --> 00:29:14.787
a different part to play, work within your spheres

645
00:29:14.787 --> 00:29:17.402
of influence, do what you absolutely know

646
00:29:17.402 --> 00:29:19.994
that you can accomplish, do that.

647
00:29:19.994 --> 00:29:21.761
Don't do what you don't believe in,

648
00:29:21.761 --> 00:29:23.782
don't do what you don't believe you can achieve,

649
00:29:23.782 --> 00:29:26.040
because it will only create fear and anxiety.

650
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.720
Do what you can do, and it may be as simple

651
00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.250
as talking to your neighbor, once you've done that

652
00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:32.345
the next thing will reveal itself and your level

653
00:29:32.345 --> 00:29:35.333
of confidence, and your knowledge of following

654
00:29:35.333 --> 00:29:38.732
your own truth will allow you to propel yourself forward.

655
00:29:38.732 --> 00:29:40.673
Yeah, you'll have times, I myself do,

656
00:29:40.673 --> 00:29:42.211
I've been doing this a long time,

657
00:29:42.211 --> 00:29:44.251
where you get overwhelmed, and it's usually

658
00:29:44.251 --> 00:29:45.952
the other things in life for me,

659
00:29:45.952 --> 00:29:48.071
it's not the work that we're doing, it's just

660
00:29:48.071 --> 00:29:50.729
five kids, big family, lot of stuff going on.

661
00:29:50.729 --> 00:29:52.579
<v Voiceover>(laughs) Like finances, all of it.</v>

662
00:29:52.579 --> 00:29:54.048
<v ->All the stuff that happens in life</v>

663
00:29:54.048 --> 00:29:55.840
but the thing that we need to remember is

664
00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.898
it is in the calmness of the center of our soul

665
00:29:58.898 --> 00:30:00.796
that the good things happen, we can't do it

666
00:30:00.796 --> 00:30:03.065
in an agitated state, our government wants

667
00:30:03.065 --> 00:30:05.155
to blow red-alerts, and orange-alerts,

668
00:30:05.155 --> 00:30:08.394
forget all of that, recognize that we have one alert,

669
00:30:08.394 --> 00:30:10.714
and it's green, it means go forward

670
00:30:10.714 --> 00:30:12.252
in what you know to be right and true

671
00:30:12.252 --> 00:30:14.633
and follow that, and at the end of the day

672
00:30:14.633 --> 00:30:16.661
the fear will dissipate.

673
00:30:16.661 --> 00:30:19.122
<v Voiceover>In terms of counter-technology, as it were,</v>

674
00:30:19.122 --> 00:30:20.940
that can kind of block and shield, and so forth,

675
00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.049
is there any technology you know of outside of

676
00:30:23.049 --> 00:30:24.721
what we're beginning to rediscover

677
00:30:24.721 --> 00:30:26.200
in really ancient technologies,

678
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:30.309
that can, in essence, do a smog bust

679
00:30:30.309 --> 00:30:32.999
on these frequencies in your domain?

680
00:30:32.999 --> 00:30:37.999
<v ->It's difficult because the carriers are so different.</v>

681
00:30:38.216 --> 00:30:40.296
You would have to develop systems to block

682
00:30:40.296 --> 00:30:43.985
each and every potential, the other way,

683
00:30:43.985 --> 00:30:45.806
you look at that side, how do you counter all of

684
00:30:45.806 --> 00:30:48.405
the signals coming in and the other way to look at it is,

685
00:30:48.405 --> 00:30:51.783
can I create a signal within my near field

686
00:30:51.783 --> 00:30:55.574
that will be strong enough that my body will lock onto it

687
00:30:55.574 --> 00:30:57.731
and ignore the rest, and that's the better approach.

688
00:30:57.731 --> 00:30:59.520
<v Voiceover>That's better, so how do you--</v>

689
00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.578
<v ->There are some things out there,</v>

690
00:31:03.328 --> 00:31:05.467
there are some electromagnetic field generators,

691
00:31:05.467 --> 00:31:07.264
and I can't give you a brand name or anything,

692
00:31:07.264 --> 00:31:08.962
but they're out there, that'll create

693
00:31:08.962 --> 00:31:12.593
an electromagnetic pulse in, say, the 7.83 hertz range

694
00:31:12.593 --> 00:31:15.081
which is the Schumann's resonance, these things exist

695
00:31:15.081 --> 00:31:17.381
they create an electromagnetic field pulse

696
00:31:17.381 --> 00:31:20.191
that the body will couple with, you will lock onto,

697
00:31:20.191 --> 00:31:22.482
but it's a pulse rate that correlates to

698
00:31:22.482 --> 00:31:23.940
the higher states of consciousness,

699
00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.630
correlates to the planet itself

700
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:28.797
and is a healthful thing, so what happens is,

701
00:31:28.797 --> 00:31:31.367
you lock onto that, you're zeroed in on that,

702
00:31:31.367 --> 00:31:33.868
and all of these other signals coming in tend to be weak

703
00:31:33.868 --> 00:31:36.107
and so you ignore them like background noise

704
00:31:36.107 --> 00:31:39.525
in a crowded room and that's exactly how it works.

705
00:31:39.525 --> 00:31:44.156
Strong systems are the better systems.

706
00:31:44.156 --> 00:31:47.605
When you think about depressed systems,

707
00:31:47.828 --> 00:31:51.136
I'm talking about human beings around the country,

708
00:31:51.136 --> 00:31:54.585
the level of depression related to stress,

709
00:31:54.585 --> 00:31:56.364
which drives the system down, which weakens

710
00:31:56.364 --> 00:31:58.923
the immune system, which weakens your own

711
00:31:58.923 --> 00:32:00.862
signal strength in terms of how you

712
00:32:00.862 --> 00:32:03.737
act as a transceiver and transducer of energy,

713
00:32:03.737 --> 00:32:08.448
all of that changes when your system is crushed by stress.

714
00:32:08.448 --> 00:32:11.556
Stress is really the root of a lot of this,

715
00:32:11.556 --> 00:32:14.086
fear drives stress, a lot of other things do as well,

716
00:32:14.086 --> 00:32:18.685
so looking for techniques, simple breathing

717
00:32:18.685 --> 00:32:21.613
can reduce stress, we've demonstrated a lot of things in

718
00:32:21.613 --> 00:32:25.313
the past, certain methods of biofeedback can be used,

719
00:32:25.313 --> 00:32:28.571
but just some basic meditation techniques,

720
00:32:28.571 --> 00:32:30.882
and we're not talking about in a religious connotation,

721
00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:34.641
I'm just talking about basic techniques for slowing

722
00:32:34.641 --> 00:32:38.861
the brain activity down, getting your body back in sync

723
00:32:39.272 --> 00:32:41.730
and providing your body with the right nutrients,

724
00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:42.970
which is something else we don't do

725
00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:45.121
in this country sufficiently, you need

726
00:32:45.121 --> 00:32:46.849
the right building blocks within the body

727
00:32:46.849 --> 00:32:48.928
to build a strong system, and then you need to

728
00:32:48.928 --> 00:32:50.320
look at stress as one of the things

729
00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.847
that break that system down, and try and find ways

730
00:32:52.847 --> 00:32:55.497
to mitigate against the stresses of life.

731
00:32:55.497 --> 00:32:58.216
A lot of that happens by taking your own control

732
00:32:58.216 --> 00:33:00.272
of your own power again, when you know

733
00:33:00.272 --> 00:33:01.911
you need to do something and you don't do it,

734
00:33:01.911 --> 00:33:04.260
your stress level actually increases.

735
00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.329
If you take a step in the direction

736
00:33:06.329 --> 00:33:07.899
of what you know to be right and true

737
00:33:07.899 --> 00:33:10.789
you regain your own control, your own empowerment

738
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:14.428
and you recognize that you're created,

739
00:33:14.428 --> 00:33:16.436
if you believe this, and I do,

740
00:33:16.436 --> 00:33:18.507
you're created in the image of a Creator,

741
00:33:18.507 --> 00:33:21.845
it's not how we look, it's what our capacity is.

742
00:33:21.845 --> 00:33:24.666
Don't insult the creation itself by limiting

743
00:33:24.666 --> 00:33:27.075
your own possibilities.

744
00:33:29.104 --> 00:33:30.683

745
00:33:30.683 --> 00:33:32.602
you may want to check out our first two interviews

746
00:33:32.602 --> 00:33:35.793
with Nick as well, you can also pick up a copy of his books

747
00:33:35.793 --> 00:33:37.492
by clicking on the link below.

748
00:33:37.492 --> 00:33:39.022
It's important that we stay on top of

749
00:33:39.022 --> 00:33:42.360
these particular issues before our freedom simply slip away.

750
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.239
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
