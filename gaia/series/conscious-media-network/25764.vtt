00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:07.806
<v ->I met up with science author and visionary</v>

2
00:00:07.806 --> 00:00:09.637
Gregg Braden in Sedona recently,

3
00:00:09.637 --> 00:00:12.171
where he was unveiling some of his newest work.

4
00:00:12.171 --> 00:00:13.976
Gregg is saying that we need to have

5
00:00:13.976 --> 00:00:17.102
a new understanding of the term intelligent design

6
00:00:17.102 --> 00:00:19.600
as he suggests that man did not evolve in the

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.326
Darwinian sense, rather was created by some other mechanism.

8
00:00:23.981 --> 00:00:26.045
He bases his evidence on several factors,

9
00:00:26.045 --> 00:00:28.025
not the least of which is that the human brain

10
00:00:28.025 --> 00:00:31.743
has been at its current size for at least 200,000 years.

11
00:00:32.124 --> 00:00:34.499
In addition, he says we're on the verge of a breakthrough

12
00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:37.633
of understanding, according to his fractal time codes

13
00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:39.414
for 2011.

14
00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:43.171
Greg, it's good to see you again,

15
00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:45.869
it's been exactly a year, not exactly to the day,

16
00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:48.646
but just about, and things have progressed.

17
00:00:48.646 --> 00:00:51.139
Changes are occurring at lightening speed around the planet

18
00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:52.546
and we have talked about some of this

19
00:00:52.546 --> 00:00:54.347
when we talked last year,

20
00:00:54.347 --> 00:00:56.451
and one of the things, when I was listening to you

21
00:00:56.451 --> 00:00:57.849
last night, you really getting into

22
00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:59.844
is this whole notion of the gap between

23
00:00:59.844 --> 00:01:02.440
science and reality.

24
00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:06.281
In terms of looking at evidence versus proof

25
00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:08.796
and these are terms that really have to start coming

26
00:01:08.796 --> 00:01:09.934
into play now

27
00:01:09.934 --> 00:01:11.634
and one of the things you were saying last night

28
00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:13.722
is science absolutely now,

29
00:01:13.722 --> 00:01:16.409
has to let go of some very important

30
00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.525
what they consider to be deep truths or tenants.

31
00:01:20.245 --> 00:01:22.443
And if you could just launch in by telling us some of those

32
00:01:22.443 --> 00:01:23.847
that need to be let go of now.

33
00:01:23.847 --> 00:01:25.701
We can't even go that way anymore.

34
00:01:25.701 --> 00:01:28.509
<v ->Well, once again, the best minds of our time</v>

35
00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.976
are telling us no uncertain terms,

36
00:01:32.616 --> 00:01:34.579
that we are in trouble.

37
00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.124
And I'm gonna be very clear,

38
00:01:36.124 --> 00:01:38.125
it's less about Earth being in trouble,

39
00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:39.995
and more about the people who live on the Earth

40
00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:41.305
being in trouble.

41
00:01:41.305 --> 00:01:43.431
We certainly have done some damage

42
00:01:43.431 --> 00:01:44.537
to the planet,

43
00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:47.688
but my sense is Earth is gonna be here 5,000 years from now,

44
00:01:47.688 --> 00:01:50.075
whether or not anyone is on Earth to enjoy the beauty

45
00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:52.742
of this world is being determined right now.

46
00:01:54.032 --> 00:01:55.379
What they're telling us,

47
00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:57.173
scientists, engineers, political leaders,

48
00:01:57.173 --> 00:01:58.997
religious leaders, spiritual leaders,

49
00:01:58.997 --> 00:02:00.543
social architects, they're all,

50
00:02:00.543 --> 00:02:02.042
from their different perspectives,

51
00:02:02.042 --> 00:02:04.429
converging with this agreement,

52
00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.867
that we're facing the greatest number of crisis

53
00:02:07.867 --> 00:02:12.071
and the greatest magnitude of each individual crisis,

54
00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:16.059
that we've ever faced as in 5,000 years of recorded

55
00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:17.432
human history.

56
00:02:17.432 --> 00:02:20.193
And the reason this is all coming to the forefront now

57
00:02:20.193 --> 00:02:23.003
is because they're telling us we have a very brief time

58
00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:24.060
to figure this out,

59
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.077
depending on what crisis we're talking about.

60
00:02:26.077 --> 00:02:28.275
Environmental crisis, they're saying

61
00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:29.738
maybe eight to 10 years.

62
00:02:29.738 --> 00:02:31.582
Jeffery Sachs, director of the Earth Institute of

63
00:02:31.582 --> 00:02:33.146
Columbia University,

64
00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:36.684
he's saying that we're already in unsustainable territory.

65
00:02:36.684 --> 00:02:38.547
<v Regina>Well, look what's happening with the birds</v>

66
00:02:38.547 --> 00:02:41.524
and the fish and yesterday I read 7,000

67
00:02:41.524 --> 00:02:44.600
buffalo and cows died in Vietnam

68
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.264
in a very short period of time.

69
00:02:46.264 --> 00:02:47.700
<v ->We don't know what's causing this,</v>

70
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.158
we don't know what's causing this rapid die off.

71
00:02:50.158 --> 00:02:52.227
Evolutionary biologists tell us

72
00:02:52.227 --> 00:02:55.150
that there have been five mass extinctions

73
00:02:55.473 --> 00:02:57.369
in the history of the Earth,

74
00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:59.330
and people weren't alive during all five of those

75
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.966
in geologic time.

76
00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:02.636
There have been five mass extinctions

77
00:03:02.636 --> 00:03:05.977
and that we are now deep into what is confirmed to be

78
00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:08.348
the sixth mass extinction.

79
00:03:08.348 --> 00:03:10.950
The question is, will humankind be among those

80
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.008
creatures that are now leaving this world?

81
00:03:14.957 --> 00:03:18.121
So, depending on which crisis we're looking at,

82
00:03:18.121 --> 00:03:19.728
we have a varying amounts of time.

83
00:03:19.728 --> 00:03:21.055
From my perspective,

84
00:03:21.055 --> 00:03:22.398
the greatest threat right now

85
00:03:22.398 --> 00:03:24.563
is the threat of war.

86
00:03:24.563 --> 00:03:27.172
War, in the 21st century,

87
00:03:27.172 --> 00:03:28.825
would be unlike any war, global war,

88
00:03:28.825 --> 00:03:30.600
any war that we've seen in the past.

89
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.365
The weapons, the technology--

90
00:03:32.365 --> 00:03:34.296
<v Regina>The number of countries with the weapons.</v>

91
00:03:34.296 --> 00:03:35.810
<v ->The number of countries that have the weapons--</v>

92
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:36.871
<v Regina>The conflicting interest.</v>

93
00:03:36.871 --> 00:03:39.386
<v ->And the ideas of war have changed so much.</v>

94
00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:42.144
War is no longer about a boundary between,

95
00:03:42.144 --> 00:03:43.954
a clearly defined boundary between two countries,

96
00:03:43.954 --> 00:03:47.403
and clearly defined uniforms,

97
00:03:47.403 --> 00:03:49.857
that clearly define who it is that's doing the fighting.

98
00:03:49.857 --> 00:03:52.295
These are wars of ideas that percolate

99
00:03:52.295 --> 00:03:54.478
throughout a global population.

100
00:03:55.053 --> 00:03:57.267
And political tensions, oil,

101
00:03:57.267 --> 00:04:00.810
the tensions between Iran and Israel, now,

102
00:04:01.072 --> 00:04:05.743
are all triggering this wartime mentality,

103
00:04:05.743 --> 00:04:07.813
that there must be a war to solve this problem.

104
00:04:07.813 --> 00:04:10.779
And I'm just using these as examples,

105
00:04:10.779 --> 00:04:12.330
all of these things

106
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.078
and other crisis, certainly the climate,

107
00:04:14.078 --> 00:04:15.843
certainly the new diseases,

108
00:04:15.843 --> 00:04:17.951
the lack of growing shortages of food,

109
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:19.795
the lack of clean water,

110
00:04:19.795 --> 00:04:22.893
population explosion that's happening right now,

111
00:04:22.893 --> 00:04:25.550
the poverty that is wreaking havoc

112
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.094
throughout the world,
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

113
00:04:27.094 --> 00:04:27.834
<v ->in increasing numbers,</v>

114
00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:29.827
including the United States of America.

115
00:04:29.827 --> 00:04:32.164
All of these are among the crisis,

116
00:04:32.164 --> 00:04:35.440
the experts telling us, pose the greatest threats

117
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.235
to our survival and the greatest number

118
00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:38.788
of magnitude of crisis recorded

119
00:04:38.788 --> 00:04:39.999
in human history.

120
00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:43.163
We're being asked to solve these problems

121
00:04:43.711 --> 00:04:46.944
and to make choices based upon

122
00:04:46.944 --> 00:04:48.639
the way that we think of ourselves

123
00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.215
and our relationship to the world.

124
00:04:50.215 --> 00:04:51.182
And this is, for me,

125
00:04:51.182 --> 00:04:53.683
this is, it's subtle and it's so powerful.

126
00:04:53.683 --> 00:04:54.491
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

127
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:55.619
<v ->It's so powerful because,</v>

128
00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:59.558
one little shift in the way we think of ourselves

129
00:04:59.558 --> 00:05:01.700
and our relationship to one another and the world,

130
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.097
makes all the difference in how we apply what we know

131
00:05:05.097 --> 00:05:06.533
to solve the problems.

132
00:05:06.533 --> 00:05:08.888
And where we get into trouble with this,

133
00:05:08.888 --> 00:05:11.635
is that what we know about ourselves

134
00:05:11.635 --> 00:05:14.206
and what we consider the modern Western world,

135
00:05:14.206 --> 00:05:18.239
is largely based upon the ideas that science

136
00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:22.584
is giving us, since science was birthed 300 years ago,

137
00:05:22.584 --> 00:05:24.910
and I was trained as a scientist,

138
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.082
I believe in science and the scientific method,

139
00:05:27.082 --> 00:05:30.649
and science is good to help us unlock the mysteries

140
00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:32.023
of our lives and the world,

141
00:05:32.023 --> 00:05:34.364
when science is applied in the way that

142
00:05:34.364 --> 00:05:35.765
it was designed,

143
00:05:35.765 --> 00:05:39.855
to honestly uncover answers,

144
00:05:40.166 --> 00:05:41.338
and when--

145
00:05:41.338 --> 00:05:43.271
<v Regina>Honestly being the operative word.</v>

146
00:05:43.271 --> 00:05:45.199
<v ->Honesty is important in science.</v>

147
00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.803
And here's what I mean by that,

148
00:05:46.803 --> 00:05:51.002
when an idea or a theory is supported by the facts

149
00:05:51.002 --> 00:05:52.905
as we know them,

150
00:05:52.905 --> 00:05:55.402
then that becomes the accepted world view

151
00:05:55.402 --> 00:05:57.710
until the facts change,

152
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.740
and when the facts change,

153
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.788
the ideas and the theories must change.

154
00:06:00.788 --> 00:06:02.222
And if they do not,

155
00:06:02.222 --> 00:06:04.826
then the scientific ideas are no longer scientific,

156
00:06:04.826 --> 00:06:07.760
they are not honoring the principles of science, itself.

157
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.100
This is precisely where we find ourselves

158
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.987
in the world today.

159
00:06:10.987 --> 00:06:14.087
We're being asked to solve the greatest crisis

160
00:06:14.087 --> 00:06:15.706
that threaten our very survival,

161
00:06:15.706 --> 00:06:19.335
this isn't just backroom chit-chat that is interesting.

162
00:06:20.695 --> 00:06:22.846
Our, literally, our survival hinges upon

163
00:06:22.846 --> 00:06:24.483
the way we answer these questions.

164
00:06:24.483 --> 00:06:27.808
We're being asked to answer the questions

165
00:06:27.808 --> 00:06:29.680
and make the choices with incomplete

166
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.676
and in some cases,

167
00:06:30.676 --> 00:06:34.189
absolutely false scientific assumptions,

168
00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:36.224
that science and the scientific world

169
00:06:36.224 --> 00:06:38.258
have been reluctant to release

170
00:06:38.258 --> 00:06:39.661
in light of the new evidence

171
00:06:39.661 --> 00:06:41.081
that's proving them wrong.

172
00:06:41.596 --> 00:06:42.658
So, what I'd like to do,

173
00:06:42.658 --> 00:06:44.421
is just identify a couple of these.

174
00:06:44.421 --> 00:06:45.565
What they are,

175
00:06:45.565 --> 00:06:47.105
what we now know,

176
00:06:47.105 --> 00:06:49.883
and why it affects the choices that we're making.

177
00:06:50.008 --> 00:06:51.729
Are you okay if we--
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

178
00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:53.977
<v ->I think one of the,</v>

179
00:06:53.977 --> 00:06:57.937
one of the clearest examples of this,

180
00:06:57.937 --> 00:06:59.870
we've spoken about before

181
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.384
in other interviews,

182
00:07:01.384 --> 00:07:03.085
was the idea that everything is separate

183
00:07:03.085 --> 00:07:04.788
from everything else.

184
00:07:04.788 --> 00:07:06.640
In 1887 there was an experiment

185
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.224
that was performed to determine

186
00:07:08.224 --> 00:07:10.061
once and for all, whether or not,

187
00:07:10.061 --> 00:07:11.656
there's a field of energy that connects everything,

188
00:07:11.656 --> 00:07:13.294
the field's not there, everything's separate.

189
00:07:13.294 --> 00:07:14.887
The experiment was performed with the

190
00:07:14.887 --> 00:07:17.797
equipment available in 1887.

191
00:07:19.047 --> 00:07:21.670
The experiment found, from that time,

192
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.805
the interpretations were that there is no field

193
00:07:24.805 --> 00:07:26.425
that connects everything.

194
00:07:26.425 --> 00:07:28.737
From 1887 until late in the 20th century,

195
00:07:28.737 --> 00:07:30.280
science had been basing the idea

196
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.044
that everything is separate from everything else

197
00:07:32.044 --> 00:07:33.446
and that what we do in one place

198
00:07:33.446 --> 00:07:35.210
has no effect and makes no difference

199
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.615
on what we do somewhere else.

200
00:07:36.615 --> 00:07:39.187
And that is certainly reflected in our civilization

201
00:07:39.187 --> 00:07:41.470
and the way we live our lives.

202
00:07:41.686 --> 00:07:44.160
1987, the same experiment was repeated

203
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.255
by United States Airforce

204
00:07:46.255 --> 00:07:47.689
using much better equipment,

205
00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:49.634
what they found is not only is the field there,

206
00:07:49.634 --> 00:07:51.389
it's there precisely the way the scientist,

207
00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:54.197
Michelson–Morley, expected in 1887.

208
00:07:54.197 --> 00:07:57.400
That information is in very

209
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.769
isolated scientific journals.

210
00:08:00.769 --> 00:08:03.738
It has not made it into mainstream teaching--

211
00:08:03.738 --> 00:08:05.834
<v Regina>Would you think that would, exactly.</v>

212
00:08:05.834 --> 00:08:08.451
<v ->In 1980, exactly, in 1987 the experiments were done,</v>

213
00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:10.615
they were published in peer reviewed journals

214
00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:13.424
like a very prestigious journal, Nature, for example.

215
00:08:13.424 --> 00:08:16.634
And it goes against the grain

216
00:08:16.634 --> 00:08:20.174
of so many other traditions of science

217
00:08:20.753 --> 00:08:23.389
that scientists have chosen, have elected,

218
00:08:23.389 --> 00:08:25.731
to simply discount this fact.

219
00:08:25.731 --> 00:08:27.135
It's not talked about,

220
00:08:27.135 --> 00:08:29.485
it's not taught in the classrooms,

221
00:08:29.485 --> 00:08:32.007
when I was in school and people my age that have children,

222
00:08:32.007 --> 00:08:33.176
and their children are being taught

223
00:08:33.176 --> 00:08:34.675
everything is separate from everything else.

224
00:08:34.675 --> 00:08:38.488
This is one example of a false assumption of science.

225
00:08:39.213 --> 00:08:41.549
Another false assumption

226
00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:43.546
is that civilization as we know it

227
00:08:43.546 --> 00:08:45.621
is only about 5,000 years old.

228
00:08:45.621 --> 00:08:47.356
5,000, 5500 years.

229
00:08:48.186 --> 00:08:49.026
When I was in school,

230
00:08:49.026 --> 00:08:50.726
and what is being taught in our schools right now,

231
00:08:50.726 --> 00:08:53.860
is that the Mesopotamian civilization,

232
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.443
in Mesopotamia Valley in ancient Sumeria,

233
00:08:56.443 --> 00:08:59.698
are the oldest known civilizations to exist.

234
00:08:59.698 --> 00:09:02.873
And if you look at, go to any textbook,

235
00:09:02.873 --> 00:09:04.844
look at a conventional timeline of history,

236
00:09:04.844 --> 00:09:06.741
and it shows 3500 BC,

237
00:09:06.741 --> 00:09:09.510
5500 years ago, is when civilization began.

238
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:13.176
The problem, is the evidence does not support that idea

239
00:09:13.176 --> 00:09:14.658
any longer.

240
00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:19.275
Verified, peer reviewed, archaeological evidence,

241
00:09:19.275 --> 00:09:22.518
using accepted scientific methods,

242
00:09:22.518 --> 00:09:25.860
are now proving, this isn't simply evidence,

243
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.526
this is proof that there have been advanced civilizations

244
00:09:31.066 --> 00:09:34.197
in our world that are at least twice as old

245
00:09:34.197 --> 00:09:36.406
as what is now accepted.

246
00:09:36.406 --> 00:09:38.137
Gobekli Tepli,

247
00:09:38.137 --> 00:09:41.396
Gobekli Tepe, I'm sorry, in Turkey, for example,

248
00:09:41.396 --> 00:09:45.562
11,500 years before the present time,

249
00:09:46.201 --> 00:09:50.680
it's now being accepted in the realms of archaeologists.

250
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:52.639
Archaeologists have the data,

251
00:09:52.639 --> 00:09:53.716
they're looking at the dates,

252
00:09:53.716 --> 00:09:55.215
they're saying, of course, this is what's happening.

253
00:09:55.215 --> 00:09:57.151
Historians, this is a horrible problem,

254
00:09:57.151 --> 00:09:59.863
because it messes up the timeline of history.

255
00:09:59.863 --> 00:10:02.829
Gobekli Teple, Gobekli Tepe.

256
00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:04.356
<v Regina>Tepe, yes, that's a hard one</v>

257
00:10:04.356 --> 00:10:04.878
to pronounce.

258
00:10:04.878 --> 00:10:05.421
<v ->T-E-P-E.</v>

259
00:10:05.421 --> 00:10:06.600
<v Regina>T-E-P-E, right.</v>

260
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.704
<v ->G-O-B-E-K-L-I,</v>

261
00:10:08.704 --> 00:10:09.536
T-E-P-E.

262
00:10:09.536 --> 00:10:10.306
<v Regina>Mmm hmm.</v>

263
00:10:10.306 --> 00:10:12.445
<v ->And this is a site, it's an amazing site.</v>

264
00:10:14.205 --> 00:10:16.377
Earth imaging radar has found

265
00:10:16.377 --> 00:10:20.199
there are at least 15 to 20 of these

266
00:10:20.199 --> 00:10:23.371
massive circular temple sites

267
00:10:23.371 --> 00:10:24.453
buried beneath the ground.

268
00:10:24.453 --> 00:10:26.611
Four to five have been excavated so far.

269
00:10:26.611 --> 00:10:28.752
<v Regina>Now, if I understood you last night,</v>

270
00:10:28.752 --> 00:10:29.877
those were buried?

271
00:10:29.877 --> 00:10:31.277
<v ->This is what's interesting.</v>

272
00:10:31.277 --> 00:10:32.108
<v Regina>That's what's, yes.</v>

273
00:10:32.108 --> 00:10:35.725
<v ->They were buried intentionally 8,000 years ago,</v>

274
00:10:35.725 --> 00:10:38.626
so that's already 3,000 years older than what we're told--

275
00:10:38.626 --> 00:10:39.334
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

276
00:10:39.334 --> 00:10:40.904
<v ->They were buried intentionally,</v>

277
00:10:40.904 --> 00:10:42.167
and we don't know the reason why,

278
00:10:42.167 --> 00:10:43.304
we don't know who built them,

279
00:10:43.304 --> 00:10:44.902
we don't know where the people came from,

280
00:10:44.902 --> 00:10:47.112
we don't know specifically, their purpose.

281
00:10:47.112 --> 00:10:49.578
There are no written records in terms of alphabets,

282
00:10:49.578 --> 00:10:53.414
there are hieroglyphic images throughout

283
00:10:53.414 --> 00:10:57.350
the vertical T-shaped stone columns

284
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.451
that comprise the circles.

285
00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:01.958
The circles are of varying diameters.

286
00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.381
They were buried intentionally,

287
00:11:03.381 --> 00:11:05.024
again, 8,000 years ago.

288
00:11:05.024 --> 00:11:06.925
The thinking is, perhaps to protect them,

289
00:11:06.925 --> 00:11:09.061
but we don't know that for sure.

290
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:12.636
But the key is, that the lowest levels,

291
00:11:12.636 --> 00:11:15.347
so the earliest occupations of this site

292
00:11:15.347 --> 00:11:16.537
are now being dated

293
00:11:16.537 --> 00:11:21.417
between 11,300 and 11,500 years before present.

294
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:24.511
Now, if that was an isolated incident,

295
00:11:24.511 --> 00:11:25.981
we could say okay, it's a fluke.

296
00:11:25.981 --> 00:11:27.585
Something else is going on.

297
00:11:27.585 --> 00:11:28.584
But it's not.

298
00:11:28.584 --> 00:11:31.172
It is one of a number of sites.

299
00:11:31.172 --> 00:11:33.452
There's another site in Turkey,

300
00:11:33.452 --> 00:11:36.618
(Inaudible) is the name of the site,

301
00:11:36.618 --> 00:11:38.287
not far from Gobekli Tepe.

302
00:11:38.287 --> 00:11:40.224
And these are very unfamiliar names

303
00:11:40.224 --> 00:11:41.514
to us here in the west,

304
00:11:41.514 --> 00:11:43.559
they're very familiar in archaeological circles.

305
00:11:43.559 --> 00:11:47.222
It's being dated right around six to 7,000 years

306
00:11:47.222 --> 00:11:48.722
before present.

307
00:11:48.839 --> 00:11:50.237
There is a site that I didn't even talk about

308
00:11:50.237 --> 00:11:51.033
last night,

309
00:11:51.033 --> 00:11:53.810
it is a site that is now submerged under the water

310
00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:56.370
off the coast of India,

311
00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.137
that is being dated at 9,500 years.

312
00:12:00.337 --> 00:12:03.764
The Great Sphinx is now being geologically dated

313
00:12:03.764 --> 00:12:06.412
and peer reviewed articles

314
00:12:06.412 --> 00:12:08.067
such as double A, P, G,

315
00:12:08.067 --> 00:12:09.723
American Association of Petroleum Geologists,

316
00:12:09.723 --> 00:12:12.125
that accepted that the Sphinx,

317
00:12:12.125 --> 00:12:13.964
the body of the Sphinx,

318
00:12:13.964 --> 00:12:15.490
based on the erosion marks

319
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:18.235
and the water it would require to create that erosion,

320
00:12:18.235 --> 00:12:21.737
it has not been present except for very specific

321
00:12:21.737 --> 00:12:23.266
periods of time, that the Sphinx,

322
00:12:23.266 --> 00:12:26.359
is between seven and 9,000 years old.

323
00:12:26.708 --> 00:12:29.008
Our history books tell us it was about 4,000 years ago.

324
00:12:29.008 --> 00:12:31.639
Somebody made it, there's no written records,

325
00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:35.102
there is, nobody knows, it is an idea

326
00:12:35.102 --> 00:12:36.905
that someone came up with.

327
00:12:36.905 --> 00:12:38.185
So these are just examples,

328
00:12:38.185 --> 00:12:40.045
but where this gets really interesting,

329
00:12:40.045 --> 00:12:41.918
is these dates that I'm sharing with you,

330
00:12:41.918 --> 00:12:45.018
the end of the last ice age, geologically,

331
00:12:45.018 --> 00:12:47.563
was between nine and 11,000 years ago.

332
00:12:47.563 --> 00:12:50.995
And for these sites to have existed,

333
00:12:50.995 --> 00:12:53.466
it means that they were either built during the ice age,

334
00:12:53.466 --> 00:12:54.862
which is pretty unlikely,

335
00:12:54.862 --> 00:12:56.827
or at least the end of the ice age,

336
00:12:59.297 --> 00:13:01.573
they had to have existed before the ice

337
00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:03.681
could cover the Earth and bury them

338
00:13:03.681 --> 00:13:05.240
and specifically, the Sphinx,

339
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.377
the erosion, 12 feet deep in some places,

340
00:13:08.377 --> 00:13:10.534
the grooves on the sides of the Sphinx.

341
00:13:11.244 --> 00:13:13.525
<v Regina>Some are even saying, potentially,</v>

342
00:13:13.525 --> 00:13:16.357
15,000, John Anthony West goes way out on a limb on it.

343
00:13:16.357 --> 00:13:17.757
<v ->He goes out on a limb, he does--</v>

344
00:13:17.757 --> 00:13:18.660
<v Regina>Even further back.</v>

345
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.829
<v ->He does, and it's based on other evidence,</v>

346
00:13:20.829 --> 00:13:23.621
I'm just gonna say that I was trained as a scientist.

347
00:13:23.621 --> 00:13:27.506
When I share information with my public,

348
00:13:27.506 --> 00:13:30.268
it's important for me to share what I know is a fact.

349
00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:31.000
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

350
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.126
<v ->What I know is a fact, is that Robert Schoch,</v>

351
00:13:34.126 --> 00:13:36.748
the stratigrapher and paleontologist,

352
00:13:36.748 --> 00:13:38.280
from Boston University,

353
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.445
has said, and he through his peer reviewed work,

354
00:13:42.445 --> 00:13:45.456
is that the erosion on the Sphinx itself,

355
00:13:45.456 --> 00:13:48.802
was caused by large amounts of fast moving water

356
00:13:48.802 --> 00:13:50.119
over long periods of time,

357
00:13:50.119 --> 00:13:51.836
not wind blown sand.

358
00:13:52.524 --> 00:13:53.824
There has not been that kind of water

359
00:13:53.824 --> 00:13:57.100
in the Sahara Desert since the rains formed

360
00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.748
in the ice melted at the end of the last ice age.

361
00:13:59.748 --> 00:14:03.357
And that dates at least seven to 9,000 years.

362
00:14:03.357 --> 00:14:05.175
<v Regina>And who knows how long it existed, prior.</v>

363
00:14:05.175 --> 00:14:07.805
<v ->Now, precisely, we don't know how long before that,</v>

364
00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:10.680
and what John Anthony West is basing his dates on,

365
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.813
is he along with Robert Schoch,

366
00:14:12.813 --> 00:14:15.314
used Earth imaging radar to look beneath

367
00:14:15.314 --> 00:14:18.852
what they thought was the bedrock

368
00:14:18.852 --> 00:14:21.554
that the Sphinx is resting upon.

369
00:14:21.554 --> 00:14:23.158
And what they found is,

370
00:14:23.158 --> 00:14:24.921
that what they Sphinx and the ground

371
00:14:24.921 --> 00:14:26.119
it looks like the Sphinx is on,

372
00:14:26.119 --> 00:14:29.660
is not really as it appears

373
00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:33.264
and there is a lot of archaeological evidence

374
00:14:33.264 --> 00:14:36.133
underneath, that remains underneath,

375
00:14:36.133 --> 00:14:39.623
it is not being excavated for some pretty good reasons,

376
00:14:39.623 --> 00:14:41.097
I would imagine,

377
00:14:42.387 --> 00:14:45.078
a lot of them are social and political reasons,

378
00:14:45.078 --> 00:14:47.311
and they don't wanna create the tension

379
00:14:47.311 --> 00:14:49.685
that this kind of evidence would create

380
00:14:49.685 --> 00:14:51.513
in an already tense part of the world.

381
00:14:51.513 --> 00:14:53.824
It will be excavated, they're just using time.

382
00:14:53.824 --> 00:14:54.855
And this is what John,

383
00:14:54.855 --> 00:14:56.451
I believe, what John Anthony West

384
00:14:56.451 --> 00:14:59.329
is basing his information upon.

385
00:14:59.329 --> 00:15:01.497
<v Regina>So we're talking very advanced civilizations--</v>

386
00:15:01.497 --> 00:15:03.094
<v ->We're talking advanced civilizations,</v>

387
00:15:03.094 --> 00:15:05.523
and at least twice as old as what we've believed in the past

388
00:15:05.523 --> 00:15:08.192
and also, they seem to cluster

389
00:15:08.192 --> 00:15:10.390
around these 5,000 year marks.

390
00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.578
So 5,000 years, the history,

391
00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:14.274
I remember when I was in school

392
00:15:14.274 --> 00:15:15.602
and when I used to study ancient Greece

393
00:15:15.602 --> 00:15:17.073
and ancient Rome and I thought wow,

394
00:15:17.073 --> 00:15:18.272
that's a long time ago,

395
00:15:18.272 --> 00:15:19.812
and it's not that long ago

396
00:15:19.812 --> 00:15:22.386
in terms of the history that we're now looking at,

397
00:15:22.386 --> 00:15:23.717
it's all relative.

398
00:15:23.717 --> 00:15:25.976
But the history that we've taught,

399
00:15:25.976 --> 00:15:27.987
is the beginning of civilization.

400
00:15:27.987 --> 00:15:30.214
It's not the beginning of civilization

401
00:15:30.214 --> 00:15:32.459
for all time for the whole world.

402
00:15:32.459 --> 00:15:35.654
It is the beginning of the most recent cycle

403
00:15:35.654 --> 00:15:39.849
of civilization, the most recent 5,000 year cycle.

404
00:15:40.597 --> 00:15:42.874
That emerged at the end of the last

405
00:15:42.874 --> 00:15:44.949
5,000 year cycle.

406
00:15:45.935 --> 00:15:47.604
And what we know about this,

407
00:15:47.604 --> 00:15:50.089
this is where science and indigenous and

408
00:15:50.089 --> 00:15:52.989
spiritual traditions all come together,

409
00:15:52.989 --> 00:15:57.035
is that about every 5,125 years,

410
00:15:57.805 --> 00:16:00.858
Earth's position in space

411
00:16:00.858 --> 00:16:02.519
brings us to a place

412
00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:04.095
where the conditions on Earth change.

413
00:16:04.095 --> 00:16:06.157
The tilt, the wobble, the angle,

414
00:16:06.157 --> 00:16:09.464
of our planet in relation to the center

415
00:16:09.464 --> 00:16:10.663
of our Milky Way galaxy

416
00:16:10.663 --> 00:16:12.535
and other forces of energy,

417
00:16:12.535 --> 00:16:14.832
change on a rhythmic basis,

418
00:16:14.832 --> 00:16:16.936
a cyclic basis, and we've talked about this before

419
00:16:16.936 --> 00:16:18.274
in other interviews.

420
00:16:18.274 --> 00:16:20.266
Somehow, our ancestors knew that.

421
00:16:20.266 --> 00:16:22.377
And they told us, our own science couldn't confirm it

422
00:16:22.377 --> 00:16:24.238
until late in the 20th century.

423
00:16:24.238 --> 00:16:25.672
But it's interesting to me

424
00:16:25.672 --> 00:16:27.418
that at least what we're seeing so far

425
00:16:27.418 --> 00:16:29.619
is right around the 5,000 year mark

426
00:16:29.619 --> 00:16:31.912
is this emergence of Sumerian

427
00:16:31.912 --> 00:16:33.547
and Mesopotamian civilizations

428
00:16:33.547 --> 00:16:36.248
and we say that's where writing began

429
00:16:36.248 --> 00:16:37.823
and alphabets were developed.

430
00:16:37.823 --> 00:16:41.061
Spiritual traditions, many of our most cherished

431
00:16:41.061 --> 00:16:44.377
spiritual traditions began at that 5,000 year mark.

432
00:16:44.935 --> 00:16:46.137
<v Regina>There's even speculation</v>

433
00:16:46.137 --> 00:16:48.198
that there were advanced technologies

434
00:16:48.198 --> 00:16:49.662
used at that time that we're just now

435
00:16:49.662 --> 00:16:51.737
going back into understanding.

436
00:16:51.737 --> 00:16:53.266
<v ->There were, and that's what these sites are showing,</v>

437
00:16:53.266 --> 00:16:55.138
is down at 10,000 years,

438
00:16:55.138 --> 00:16:57.574
we're seeing advanced civilizations,

439
00:16:57.574 --> 00:16:59.509
that obviously existed,

440
00:16:59.509 --> 00:17:01.752
how much of what they knew

441
00:17:01.752 --> 00:17:04.312
percolated into the five most recent

442
00:17:04.312 --> 00:17:07.937
5,000 years is what we're now beginning to understand.

443
00:17:08.118 --> 00:17:09.651
We're now learning.

444
00:17:09.651 --> 00:17:10.818
But the point of all this,

445
00:17:10.818 --> 00:17:11.988
is that we've been here much longer

446
00:17:11.988 --> 00:17:13.986
that what we've been led to believe.

447
00:17:13.986 --> 00:17:16.697
And that there's this lineage of wisdom

448
00:17:16.697 --> 00:17:17.664
that predates us,

449
00:17:17.664 --> 00:17:19.989
we stand on the shoulders of our ancestors

450
00:17:19.989 --> 00:17:21.572
who have come before us,

451
00:17:21.572 --> 00:17:23.067
and because we are faced

452
00:17:23.067 --> 00:17:26.744
with crisis that appears to be cyclic,

453
00:17:26.744 --> 00:17:29.134
rhythmic, I think it behooves us to honor

454
00:17:29.134 --> 00:17:31.387
the wisdom of our past

455
00:17:31.387 --> 00:17:35.747
and to take into account what our ancestors

456
00:17:35.747 --> 00:17:37.906
have preserved and shared for us today

457
00:17:37.906 --> 00:17:41.320
and marry that with the best science of our time

458
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.160
to help, we need all the help we can get,

459
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.461
to solve the problems--
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

460
00:17:44.461 --> 00:17:45.818
<v ->And the crisis that are here,</v>

461
00:17:45.818 --> 00:17:47.908
so this is one place where science has got it wrong,

462
00:17:47.908 --> 00:17:49.063
right now.

463
00:17:50.663 --> 00:17:53.831
That civilization, the evidence

464
00:17:55.351 --> 00:17:58.135
is so strong that we have been here

465
00:17:58.135 --> 00:17:59.974
at least twice as long as,

466
00:17:59.974 --> 00:18:03.111
in terms of civilization as what we believed in the past.

467
00:18:03.111 --> 00:18:05.547
And that is one place where I think

468
00:18:05.547 --> 00:18:08.242
we need to really make some inroads and

469
00:18:08.242 --> 00:18:10.115
embrace the new evidence.

470
00:18:10.115 --> 00:18:12.377
But even deeper than that,

471
00:18:12.377 --> 00:18:14.780
the great question that we've asked ourselves,

472
00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.122
for so long, since the earliest records

473
00:18:18.122 --> 00:18:21.627
of humankind show up on Aboriginal rock paintings

474
00:18:21.627 --> 00:18:24.361
in Australia dated at 23,000 years old,

475
00:18:24.361 --> 00:18:25.886
is who are we,

476
00:18:25.886 --> 00:18:29.067
and the way that we've answered this question,

477
00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:30.531
a lot of people think

478
00:18:30.531 --> 00:18:32.402
it's just a philosophical conversation,

479
00:18:32.402 --> 00:18:35.781
but the answer to the question of who we are,

480
00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:37.382
is the key

481
00:18:39.332 --> 00:18:42.475
to the way that we solve our problems

482
00:18:42.475 --> 00:18:43.751
and the choices that we make,

483
00:18:43.751 --> 00:18:45.421
the policies that we enact,

484
00:18:45.421 --> 00:18:48.421
the laws that we pass are all based in our beliefs

485
00:18:48.421 --> 00:18:49.944
of who we are,

486
00:18:49.944 --> 00:18:51.426
our relationship to one another,

487
00:18:51.426 --> 00:18:53.226
our relationship to this Earth,

488
00:18:53.226 --> 00:18:56.543
and our relationship to whatever is beyond this world.

489
00:18:56.658 --> 00:18:58.765
This is why this question is so important.

490
00:18:58.765 --> 00:19:02.284
In 1859, Charles Darwin,

491
00:19:02.284 --> 00:19:04.899
attempted to answer this question

492
00:19:04.899 --> 00:19:06.675
through his direct experiences

493
00:19:06.675 --> 00:19:09.001
on a journey that he had

494
00:19:09.001 --> 00:19:12.215
in the Galapagos Islands and other places.

495
00:19:13.625 --> 00:19:15.409
He attempted to answer the question

496
00:19:15.409 --> 00:19:16.955
through his observations

497
00:19:16.955 --> 00:19:19.388
and the best science of his time.

498
00:19:19.388 --> 00:19:21.586
And I'm not gonna say that what he did was right

499
00:19:21.586 --> 00:19:25.094
or wrong, it worked for his period in history,

500
00:19:25.094 --> 00:19:28.615
Darwin had no way of knowing what we know today.

501
00:19:28.964 --> 00:19:32.099
He had no way of knowing about the complexities of life

502
00:19:32.099 --> 00:19:34.092
inside of the cell,

503
00:19:34.092 --> 00:19:36.369
the hundreds of thousands of mechanisms

504
00:19:36.369 --> 00:19:38.897
that must be present all at once

505
00:19:38.897 --> 00:19:40.674
for a cell to function properly.

506
00:19:40.674 --> 00:19:43.546
We cannot evolve over long periods of time,

507
00:19:43.546 --> 00:19:47.218
the respiration, metabolism, the reproduction of a cell,

508
00:19:47.218 --> 00:19:48.449
if any one of those are gone,

509
00:19:48.449 --> 00:19:50.911
the cell isn't going to function.

510
00:19:50.911 --> 00:19:53.016
And one of Darwin's theories,

511
00:19:53.016 --> 00:19:55.389
a portion of his theory of evolution

512
00:19:55.389 --> 00:19:57.587
that was introduced in 1959,

513
00:19:57.587 --> 00:20:01.398
is that nature only gives us what we need

514
00:20:01.398 --> 00:20:02.864
when we need it.

515
00:20:02.864 --> 00:20:06.769
So that we are endowed

516
00:20:06.769 --> 00:20:08.228
is the term that he used,

517
00:20:08.228 --> 00:20:10.338
we are endowed with the things that we need

518
00:20:10.338 --> 00:20:13.236
only when the circumstances of life

519
00:20:13.236 --> 00:20:15.776
precipitate a need for those things,

520
00:20:15.776 --> 00:20:17.711
so he was looking at finches.

521
00:20:17.711 --> 00:20:20.550
It's a species of bird in the Galapagos Islands

522
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:24.545
and he noticed that a certain species of finch

523
00:20:25.375 --> 00:20:26.389
developed beaks

524
00:20:26.389 --> 00:20:28.546
that were much bigger and much stronger

525
00:20:28.546 --> 00:20:31.655
so that they could crack nuts from a different tree

526
00:20:31.655 --> 00:20:34.385
that afforded them a greater food source,

527
00:20:34.385 --> 00:20:37.003
and it was a perfectly,

528
00:20:37.003 --> 00:20:38.263
it was a beautiful observation,

529
00:20:38.263 --> 00:20:39.789
and he was right on,

530
00:20:39.789 --> 00:20:42.336
and there was an adaptation of the finch

531
00:20:42.336 --> 00:20:44.308
to do those things.

532
00:20:44.308 --> 00:20:46.102
And this lead to a theory,

533
00:20:46.102 --> 00:20:47.773
he called it the Theory of Evolution,

534
00:20:47.773 --> 00:20:50.890
just encapsulate, the Theory of Evolution says that

535
00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.680
in any species, there are differences,

536
00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.176
some differences serve the species,

537
00:20:56.176 --> 00:20:58.251
some do not, the ones that do

538
00:20:58.251 --> 00:21:00.109
are passed on through the genes

539
00:21:00.109 --> 00:21:03.524
to the offspring and they, rather than become unique

540
00:21:03.524 --> 00:21:07.189
to a few they become the way that species is.

541
00:21:07.189 --> 00:21:08.420
It's a good theory.

542
00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:10.533
It's based on his direct observations.

543
00:21:10.533 --> 00:21:12.400
And if he'd stop there I think he probably

544
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.667
would have been okay.

545
00:21:13.667 --> 00:21:15.568
The problem is,

546
00:21:15.568 --> 00:21:17.698
that Darwin himself,

547
00:21:17.698 --> 00:21:21.140
took a theory that was specific to some animals

548
00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.403
in some parts of the world,

549
00:21:23.403 --> 00:21:24.708
and he tried to generalize that

550
00:21:24.708 --> 00:21:26.850
to all life, including human life,

551
00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.142
for all time.

552
00:21:28.142 --> 00:21:30.147
And there are a number of assumptions,

553
00:21:30.147 --> 00:21:32.512
that go along with this,

554
00:21:32.512 --> 00:21:33.619
scientific assumptions.

555
00:21:33.619 --> 00:21:35.116
One is that life itself

556
00:21:35.116 --> 00:21:37.285
can come from non-life.

557
00:21:37.285 --> 00:21:39.528
That what's called spontaneous generation,

558
00:21:39.528 --> 00:21:44.056
that life developed over a long period of time,

559
00:21:44.056 --> 00:21:47.414
from a random process of biology.

560
00:21:48.605 --> 00:21:50.709
That is, that's one of the assumptions.

561
00:21:50.709 --> 00:21:53.598
Another of the assumptions is that

562
00:21:54.343 --> 00:21:55.574
these changes happen,

563
00:21:55.574 --> 00:21:58.509
life is evolved slowly over long periods of time.

564
00:21:58.509 --> 00:22:00.039
There's another assumption.

565
00:22:00.039 --> 00:22:03.454
It has been condensed into the household word,

566
00:22:03.454 --> 00:22:04.551
survival of the fittest.

567
00:22:04.551 --> 00:22:06.620
That's a Darwinian assumption

568
00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.402
that the fittest will prevail.

569
00:22:11.159 --> 00:22:13.515
In whatever situation.

570
00:22:14.324 --> 00:22:16.332
He tried to generalize these to all life

571
00:22:16.332 --> 00:22:18.201
including human life,

572
00:22:18.201 --> 00:22:19.299
now I'm gonna say right now,

573
00:22:19.299 --> 00:22:21.434
I don't know the answer

574
00:22:21.434 --> 00:22:22.667
to where we came from,

575
00:22:22.667 --> 00:22:25.040
and I don't know the answer to how we got here,

576
00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.577
I don't think any of us do right now.

577
00:22:28.897 --> 00:22:31.332
My training as a scientist tells me

578
00:22:31.332 --> 00:22:34.681
that science is a good way to understand

579
00:22:34.681 --> 00:22:37.949
our world when we honor the principles of science itself,

580
00:22:37.949 --> 00:22:40.316
and one of the key principles of science

581
00:22:40.316 --> 00:22:42.921
is that when the evidence

582
00:22:42.921 --> 00:22:44.388
no longer supports an idea,

583
00:22:44.388 --> 00:22:46.387
we go back and create a new idea,

584
00:22:46.387 --> 00:22:47.930
a new theory.

585
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:50.458
Science is not doing that right now.

586
00:22:50.458 --> 00:22:52.158
Civilization is a perfect example,

587
00:22:52.158 --> 00:22:53.271
the evidence shows we've been here

588
00:22:53.271 --> 00:22:54.371
longer than 5,000 years,

589
00:22:54.371 --> 00:22:56.236
but the history books aren't showing that.

590
00:22:56.236 --> 00:22:58.634
In terms of biology and evolution,

591
00:22:58.634 --> 00:23:00.504
the evidence clearly shows

592
00:23:00.504 --> 00:23:02.843
life has never been documented

593
00:23:02.843 --> 00:23:04.980
as originating spontaneously,

594
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.076
there's no scientific evidence

595
00:23:07.076 --> 00:23:09.443
that it will or can happen

596
00:23:09.443 --> 00:23:11.850
for a number of very good scientific reasons

597
00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:14.652
yet it is an assumption that is still being made

598
00:23:14.652 --> 00:23:16.524
and taught in the schools today.

599
00:23:16.524 --> 00:23:20.424
Okay, the idea that

600
00:23:21.564 --> 00:23:23.080
survival of the fittest,

601
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.490
there were 400 peer reviewed studies,

602
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:28.004
that were done in late 1990,

603
00:23:28.004 --> 00:23:29.471
well, they've been done for the last 100 years,

604
00:23:29.471 --> 00:23:33.376
they were reviewed by Alfie Kohn in the late 1990's,

605
00:23:34.515 --> 00:23:37.107
and the bottom line to all 400 studies,

606
00:23:37.107 --> 00:23:39.180
they were designed to answer a single question,

607
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.846
and the question is simply this,

608
00:23:41.946 --> 00:23:44.608
what is the optimum amount of competition

609
00:23:44.608 --> 00:23:47.855
that will benefit members of any species?

610
00:23:47.855 --> 00:23:50.493
400, over 400 studies all came to the same number

611
00:23:50.493 --> 00:23:51.983
and the number is zero.

612
00:23:51.983 --> 00:23:52.860
Zero.

613
00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.229
And when I talk about competition

614
00:23:54.229 --> 00:23:56.528
I'm talking about violent competition,

615
00:23:56.528 --> 00:23:58.394
not a friendly game of soccer or chess

616
00:23:58.394 --> 00:23:59.599
or something like that,

617
00:23:59.599 --> 00:24:00.890
alway, always--

618
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:02.215
<v Regina>Survival oriented competition.</v>

619
00:24:02.215 --> 00:24:03.830
<v ->Precisely, always, always, always,</v>

620
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.744
where it's called mutual aid or cooperation

621
00:24:06.744 --> 00:24:08.337
benefits a species,

622
00:24:08.337 --> 00:24:10.144
they live longer, they're healthier,

623
00:24:10.144 --> 00:24:12.235
they have more options for the way

624
00:24:12.235 --> 00:24:15.648
and innovations, the way they can live their lives.

625
00:24:15.648 --> 00:24:18.478
The animal kingdom clearly shows this,

626
00:24:18.478 --> 00:24:20.443
and they go back and show studies

627
00:24:20.443 --> 00:24:22.487
of insect populations that work together,

628
00:24:22.487 --> 00:24:24.847
ant colonies for example, bee colonies.

629
00:24:25.827 --> 00:24:28.763
Nature is not based on survival of the fittest

630
00:24:28.763 --> 00:24:32.321
as fittest has been defined by science

631
00:24:32.321 --> 00:24:34.168
in the modern world.

632
00:24:34.168 --> 00:24:35.503
It's not about the strongest,

633
00:24:35.503 --> 00:24:37.616
now where we've gotten into trouble with this,

634
00:24:37.616 --> 00:24:40.635
is it's very easy for a distorted mind

635
00:24:41.745 --> 00:24:45.279
to take that science and bend it

636
00:24:45.279 --> 00:24:48.075
and skew it in very unhealthy ways.

637
00:24:48.075 --> 00:24:50.280
And some of the greatest horrors

638
00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.144
of the most oppressive dictatorships and regimes

639
00:24:54.144 --> 00:24:58.326
in the 20th century, including Nazi Germany,

640
00:24:58.326 --> 00:24:59.459
including--

641
00:25:00.459 --> 00:25:00.984
<v Regina>Pol Pot?</v>

642
00:25:00.984 --> 00:25:04.098
<v ->Pol Pot, and the way that he</v>

643
00:25:04.098 --> 00:25:06.235
was imposing his beliefs on the people

644
00:25:06.235 --> 00:25:07.437
of Cambodia.

645
00:25:08.677 --> 00:25:10.105
Some of the greatest atrocities,

646
00:25:10.105 --> 00:25:12.676
they all are based back

647
00:25:12.676 --> 00:25:16.151
in the ideas of survival of the fittest.

648
00:25:16.435 --> 00:25:17.908
And the only

649
00:25:19.308 --> 00:25:22.482
that only those characteristics

650
00:25:22.482 --> 00:25:23.855
that benefit the species

651
00:25:23.855 --> 00:25:26.415
should be passed on in the thinking of these people--

652
00:25:26.415 --> 00:25:28.117
<v Regina>That's a basic might is right.</v>

653
00:25:28.117 --> 00:25:30.284
<v ->Might is right in the thinking of these people,</v>

654
00:25:30.284 --> 00:25:32.528
was that they would help nature along,

655
00:25:32.528 --> 00:25:34.857
and weed out what they considered to be

656
00:25:34.857 --> 00:25:36.229
the imperfect races.

657
00:25:36.229 --> 00:25:38.565
Now, I'm not saying Darwin's responsible for that,

658
00:25:38.565 --> 00:25:41.157
I'm saying that these ideas,

659
00:25:41.157 --> 00:25:43.240
are important in our lives,

660
00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.262
because they, the way we think of ourselves,

661
00:25:46.262 --> 00:25:47.605
consciously and subconsciously

662
00:25:47.605 --> 00:25:49.777
is based upon the language of science

663
00:25:49.777 --> 00:25:51.116
that we've grown to trust.

664
00:25:51.116 --> 00:25:52.442
At least to a degree.

665
00:25:52.442 --> 00:25:53.979
This is important because

666
00:25:53.979 --> 00:25:56.878
as we're now facing the great crisis,

667
00:25:56.878 --> 00:25:59.882
and some of the crisis are what people perceive

668
00:25:59.882 --> 00:26:01.878
as competition for resources.

669
00:26:01.878 --> 00:26:04.551
If we go about solving those problems

670
00:26:04.551 --> 00:26:07.605
the way we have in the last 150 years

671
00:26:07.605 --> 00:26:09.478
since Darwin's time, we're in trouble.

672
00:26:09.478 --> 00:26:12.121
Because we've done it through military might.

673
00:26:12.121 --> 00:26:14.202
And it has not served us,

674
00:26:14.202 --> 00:26:16.437
the wars that happened in the past

675
00:26:16.437 --> 00:26:18.368
have been very different from the kind of wars

676
00:26:18.368 --> 00:26:20.737
that will develop today if we use that principle

677
00:26:20.737 --> 00:26:23.506
and apply it through the technology of today.

678
00:26:23.506 --> 00:26:27.525
We're in very, very dangerous territories to do that.

679
00:26:27.543 --> 00:26:29.005
And we're teetering right on the edge,

680
00:26:29.005 --> 00:26:33.784
and it's the year 2011, 2011 is a pivotal year.

681
00:26:34.494 --> 00:26:35.721
<v Regina>Yeah, I was going to ask you about that</v>

682
00:26:35.721 --> 00:26:36.753
from the time code.

683
00:26:36.753 --> 00:26:37.648
<v ->Sure and--</v>

684
00:26:37.648 --> 00:26:38.554
<v Regina>Let's go into that now,</v>

685
00:26:38.554 --> 00:26:39.630
and how this plays in--

686
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:40.695
<v ->Well, from many perspectives,</v>

687
00:26:40.695 --> 00:26:42.222
so I just wanna, kind of wanna wrap this up,

688
00:26:42.222 --> 00:26:44.201
the way we think of ourselves

689
00:26:44.201 --> 00:26:45.473
is important.

690
00:26:46.093 --> 00:26:48.035
And while we may have our personal

691
00:26:48.035 --> 00:26:52.716
and intuitive sense for what life is all about,

692
00:26:54.329 --> 00:26:57.724
when we see it confirmed

693
00:26:57.724 --> 00:26:59.596
in a peer reviewed journal

694
00:26:59.596 --> 00:27:01.101
in the language of science

695
00:27:01.101 --> 00:27:03.146
and it's accepted in media

696
00:27:03.146 --> 00:27:05.111
and it's accepted by our friends and our families

697
00:27:05.111 --> 00:27:07.222
and our universities and our governments

698
00:27:07.222 --> 00:27:10.154
it does have an effect on the way we think about ourselves.

699
00:27:10.154 --> 00:27:11.137
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

700
00:27:11.137 --> 00:27:12.523
<v ->It certainly does.</v>

701
00:27:12.523 --> 00:27:13.895
<v Regina>It's called programming.</v>

702
00:27:13.895 --> 00:27:14.612
<v ->It is.</v>

703
00:27:14.612 --> 00:27:15.456
(laughing)

704
00:27:15.456 --> 00:27:16.656
Well, the last piece that I wanna talk about,

705
00:27:16.656 --> 00:27:18.261
the other thing, is the last piece,

706
00:27:19.311 --> 00:27:22.969
there is another alternative theory

707
00:27:22.969 --> 00:27:25.696
that is emerging that is catching a lot of flack

708
00:27:25.696 --> 00:27:27.171
from the scientific community,

709
00:27:27.171 --> 00:27:29.205
and it's called intelligent design.

710
00:27:29.205 --> 00:27:30.813
And a lot of people roll their eyes

711
00:27:30.813 --> 00:27:31.974
when they hear that because

712
00:27:31.974 --> 00:27:34.604
they think it's an old idea of creationism,

713
00:27:35.964 --> 00:27:39.624
being re-framed on a different language.

714
00:27:40.394 --> 00:27:42.191
In its truest sense, it is not.

715
00:27:42.191 --> 00:27:43.189
It is not true.

716
00:27:43.979 --> 00:27:46.457
What intelligent design simply says,

717
00:27:47.337 --> 00:27:49.866
and this is the essence of the theory itself,

718
00:27:49.866 --> 00:27:53.191
is that the ideas of Darwinism don't apply

719
00:27:53.191 --> 00:27:56.486
to life, and specifically human life.

720
00:27:56.486 --> 00:27:59.007
That the evidence that was not available to Darwin,

721
00:27:59.007 --> 00:28:02.693
the inner intricacies of a cell,

722
00:28:02.711 --> 00:28:06.814
the 100's of 1000's of processes

723
00:28:06.814 --> 00:28:08.919
that must be simultaneously present

724
00:28:08.919 --> 00:28:10.349
for a cell to work,

725
00:28:10.349 --> 00:28:12.455
the intricacies of DNA.

726
00:28:12.455 --> 00:28:14.657
Darwin had no way of knowing about those things

727
00:28:14.657 --> 00:28:15.922
and he said himself,

728
00:28:15.922 --> 00:28:17.228
Darwin in his writings,

729
00:28:17.228 --> 00:28:19.353
he said if ever it can be proven

730
00:28:19.353 --> 00:28:23.927
that an organ in a body does not follow

731
00:28:23.927 --> 00:28:25.262
the principles of evolution

732
00:28:25.262 --> 00:28:26.702
he said my whole theory falls apart.

733
00:28:26.702 --> 00:28:27.639
He allowed for that,

734
00:28:27.639 --> 00:28:30.260
but science will not allow for his theory

735
00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:33.551
to evolve into a greater understanding.

736
00:28:34.172 --> 00:28:36.340
Intelligent design simply says,

737
00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:39.241
that life and the universe, the patterns of life,

738
00:28:39.241 --> 00:28:42.375
are best described,

739
00:28:44.065 --> 00:28:46.455
and I wanna use the right language here,

740
00:28:46.455 --> 00:28:48.887
through a directed process

741
00:28:48.887 --> 00:28:52.944
rather than random events of biology.

742
00:28:53.475 --> 00:28:55.330
By directed process, it doesn't say who

743
00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:56.693
or what or how,

744
00:28:56.693 --> 00:28:59.157
it simply suggests there's some form

745
00:28:59.157 --> 00:29:00.533
of intelligence

746
00:29:00.533 --> 00:29:04.134
that underlies the life as we see it today,

747
00:29:04.134 --> 00:29:07.408
and many scientists have entire careers

748
00:29:07.408 --> 00:29:09.838
vested in the idea that that is not the case

749
00:29:09.838 --> 00:29:11.445
and they're very reluctant to let that go.

750
00:29:12.485 --> 00:29:15.001
And I'm not saying one's right or wrong,

751
00:29:15.001 --> 00:29:15.905
but what I'm saying is,

752
00:29:15.905 --> 00:29:17.985
we're in trouble here on planet Earth,

753
00:29:17.985 --> 00:29:19.712
and we've got problems to solve,

754
00:29:19.712 --> 00:29:23.692
and to forbid us academically

755
00:29:23.692 --> 00:29:25.922
from investigating another theory

756
00:29:25.922 --> 00:29:27.825
is unscientific unto itself.

757
00:29:27.825 --> 00:29:31.734
To forbid to even teach the possibility

758
00:29:31.734 --> 00:29:34.470
of some form of intelligent design

759
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:36.451
I think is not serving us right now,

760
00:29:36.451 --> 00:29:37.368
it's my personal opinion.

761
00:29:37.368 --> 00:29:38.802
<v Regina>What seems to me, is simply acknowledging</v>

762
00:29:38.802 --> 00:29:41.874
that there is an innate intelligence to the field,

763
00:29:41.874 --> 00:29:44.043
that is participating in the creative process

764
00:29:44.043 --> 00:29:45.540
of all things.

765
00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:46.372
<v ->That's all it is, other people</v>

766
00:29:46.372 --> 00:29:47.246
are reading other things into it.

767
00:29:47.246 --> 00:29:50.181
So the strongest evidence for intelligent design

768
00:29:50.181 --> 00:29:52.046
is simply something that's called

769
00:29:52.046 --> 00:29:55.386
irreducible complexity, and very complicated term

770
00:29:55.386 --> 00:29:56.851
for a very simple idea.

771
00:29:56.851 --> 00:29:58.192
It simply means

772
00:29:58.192 --> 00:30:00.828
that the systems of life as we know them today

773
00:30:00.828 --> 00:30:03.400
from the cells to the DNA,

774
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.127
bacteria and the way things work,

775
00:30:06.127 --> 00:30:09.702
evolution in and of itself cannot explain

776
00:30:09.702 --> 00:30:11.637
the way that they've appeared,

777
00:30:11.637 --> 00:30:14.802
because in an irreducibly complex system,

778
00:30:14.802 --> 00:30:16.646
everything must be present.

779
00:30:16.646 --> 00:30:17.081
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

780
00:30:17.081 --> 00:30:18.545
<v ->All at the same time or it won't work.</v>

781
00:30:18.545 --> 00:30:20.043
The mousetrap is the perfect example.

782
00:30:20.043 --> 00:30:21.939
If there's one piece of a mousetrap

783
00:30:21.939 --> 00:30:23.002
that's not there, that mousetrap

784
00:30:23.002 --> 00:30:24.485
is not gonna trap the mouse.

785
00:30:24.485 --> 00:30:27.524
And everything must be there simultaneously

786
00:30:27.524 --> 00:30:29.021
and the human body, hemoglobin

787
00:30:29.021 --> 00:30:30.285
is a beautiful example.

788
00:30:30.285 --> 00:30:33.155
20 different proteins must be present

789
00:30:33.155 --> 00:30:35.677
for a hemoglobin to allow our blood to clot.

790
00:30:35.677 --> 00:30:37.856
And if one of those is not there,

791
00:30:38.916 --> 00:30:40.265
when we begin to bleed,

792
00:30:40.265 --> 00:30:42.328
it won't clot, we'll bleed and bleed and bleed.

793
00:30:43.448 --> 00:30:45.809
Those proteins all have to be there

794
00:30:45.809 --> 00:30:49.845
simultaneously and life appears to be functioning

795
00:30:49.845 --> 00:30:52.312
in this way and the geological record

796
00:30:52.312 --> 00:30:55.071
itself shows that rather than evolve

797
00:30:55.071 --> 00:30:57.513
over long periods of time,

798
00:30:57.513 --> 00:31:00.238
most, 98% of what's called the phyla,

799
00:31:00.238 --> 00:31:01.589
of life as we know it today,

800
00:31:01.589 --> 00:31:03.516
the different species of life,

801
00:31:03.516 --> 00:31:06.355
appeared about 545 million years ago,

802
00:31:06.355 --> 00:31:10.129
boom, in what's called the Cambrian explosion.

803
00:31:10.129 --> 00:31:12.500
It's considered to be the Big Bang of life.

804
00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.904
And from there they've adapted and changed over time,

805
00:31:14.904 --> 00:31:15.732
and that's true, and we have

806
00:31:15.732 --> 00:31:17.634
a beautiful fossil record of that,

807
00:31:18.604 --> 00:31:22.612
but that Cambrian explosion is a problem

808
00:31:22.612 --> 00:31:24.709
for people that support the theory of evolution

809
00:31:24.709 --> 00:31:28.268
because it does not show life evolving gradually

810
00:31:28.268 --> 00:31:30.843
slowly over long periods of time to reach that point.

811
00:31:30.843 --> 00:31:32.043
Boom, something happened.

812
00:31:32.043 --> 00:31:33.649
<v Regina>As new features are needed as you said earlier,</v>

813
00:31:33.649 --> 00:31:34.553
and you mentioned last night about

814
00:31:34.553 --> 00:31:35.847
the human brain itself.

815
00:31:35.847 --> 00:31:36.785
<v ->Human brain is perfect--</v>

816
00:31:36.785 --> 00:31:37.637
<v Regina>This is the perfect example.</v>

817
00:31:37.637 --> 00:31:39.122
<v ->Well humankind, human, for me,</v>

818
00:31:39.122 --> 00:31:42.155
humankind fits, is a completely different category.

819
00:31:42.155 --> 00:31:45.075
We appeared, we humans appeared,

820
00:31:45.075 --> 00:31:47.355
about 200,000 years ago.

821
00:31:47.355 --> 00:31:49.422
And the fossil evidence shows

822
00:31:49.422 --> 00:31:50.451
that our bodies have changed

823
00:31:50.451 --> 00:31:52.284
very little in those 200,000 years.

824
00:31:52.284 --> 00:31:53.968
Modern humans appeared,

825
00:31:53.968 --> 00:31:57.801
our skulls, our brain capacity is the same now,

826
00:31:57.801 --> 00:31:59.297
as it was then.

827
00:31:59.297 --> 00:32:00.343
And that's not evolution,

828
00:32:00.343 --> 00:32:02.279
evolution says that we are only given

829
00:32:02.279 --> 00:32:03.712
what we need when we need it.

830
00:32:03.712 --> 00:32:06.521
Why would humankind 200,000

831
00:32:06.521 --> 00:32:08.455
years ago have needed the brain capacity

832
00:32:08.455 --> 00:32:10.952
we have today to live at least the way we believe

833
00:32:10.952 --> 00:32:12.620
that they lived?

834
00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:15.695
So I think evolution definitely exists.

835
00:32:16.605 --> 00:32:18.162
It applies to some forms of life,

836
00:32:18.162 --> 00:32:20.522
it's been observed.

837
00:32:20.522 --> 00:32:23.023
Adaption, or adaptation,

838
00:32:23.023 --> 00:32:25.738
is also plays a role in this.

839
00:32:25.738 --> 00:32:27.414
I think the problem

840
00:32:27.414 --> 00:32:28.554
is trying to apply it to all life,

841
00:32:28.554 --> 00:32:29.565
number one and number two

842
00:32:29.565 --> 00:32:30.334
to human life.

843
00:32:30.334 --> 00:32:32.911
Something very, very different happened

844
00:32:32.911 --> 00:32:34.617
200,000 years ago,

845
00:32:34.617 --> 00:32:35.908
and if science, if we could take the

846
00:32:35.908 --> 00:32:37.902
beautiful, brilliant minds and hearts

847
00:32:37.902 --> 00:32:40.418
of some of the best minds of our time

848
00:32:40.418 --> 00:32:42.892
and apply it to looking honestly,

849
00:32:42.892 --> 00:32:46.328
what happened 200,000 years ago?

850
00:32:46.328 --> 00:32:48.196
How did we get here?

851
00:32:48.196 --> 00:32:51.679
And really apply the energy

852
00:32:51.679 --> 00:32:53.667
to asking that new question,

853
00:32:53.667 --> 00:32:56.024
rather than trying to prove an old idea

854
00:32:56.024 --> 00:32:57.303
that is not working out.

855
00:32:57.303 --> 00:33:00.343
We've been, we have been for 150 years

856
00:33:00.343 --> 00:33:01.499
since Darwin's theory

857
00:33:01.499 --> 00:33:04.040
trying to find the missing links that are still missing

858
00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.147
in the fossil record

859
00:33:05.147 --> 00:33:06.799
and I believe they're missing because

860
00:33:06.799 --> 00:33:08.065
they don't exist.

861
00:33:08.065 --> 00:33:08.714
<v Regina>I agree.</v>

862
00:33:08.714 --> 00:33:11.112
Okay, this brings up a really good question.

863
00:33:11.112 --> 00:33:12.612
As we come into this time

864
00:33:12.612 --> 00:33:14.719
and the time code says these things

865
00:33:14.719 --> 00:33:16.059
you're going to talk about in a minute,

866
00:33:16.059 --> 00:33:19.556
a lot of disintegration of systems is set to occur

867
00:33:19.556 --> 00:33:22.530
starting in 2011 really and moving forward.

868
00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:26.063
The world of science itself,

869
00:33:26.063 --> 00:33:29.134
it's like when you have nothing to lose,

870
00:33:29.974 --> 00:33:33.155
you can become and share what you truly are

871
00:33:33.155 --> 00:33:33.895
and know,

872
00:33:33.895 --> 00:33:35.040
when you have nothing left to lose.

873
00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.606
Well, there's so much that's being lost now,

874
00:33:37.606 --> 00:33:38.542
and I would have to think

875
00:33:38.542 --> 00:33:40.679
that that includes scientific grant money.

876
00:33:40.679 --> 00:33:43.044
A lot of people continue with their science

877
00:33:43.044 --> 00:33:45.074
for pure economics.

878
00:33:45.074 --> 00:33:46.089
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

879
00:33:46.089 --> 00:33:47.947
<v Regina>Now when the money goes away,</v>

880
00:33:47.947 --> 00:33:50.719
may some of those brilliant minds be freed up?

881
00:33:50.719 --> 00:33:52.458
Are you seeing evidence that some of these minds

882
00:33:52.458 --> 00:33:55.697
are being freed up to look in new places, now?

883
00:33:55.697 --> 00:33:58.255
<v ->I don't know the answer to what you're saying.</v>

884
00:33:58.255 --> 00:34:00.501
I know that science has become an industry.

885
00:34:00.501 --> 00:34:01.659
Science is a business.

886
00:34:01.659 --> 00:34:03.069
And I'm not saying that's right, wrong,

887
00:34:03.069 --> 00:34:04.728
good or bad, it's how it's applied,

888
00:34:04.728 --> 00:34:05.571
all of this,

889
00:34:05.571 --> 00:34:07.973
I'm not saying that our choices are bad,

890
00:34:07.973 --> 00:34:09.708
or that the way we've lived is bad,

891
00:34:09.708 --> 00:34:12.015
everything we've done has served us

892
00:34:12.015 --> 00:34:14.357
to get to the point where we are right now,

893
00:34:14.357 --> 00:34:16.305
where we can look back and say

894
00:34:16.305 --> 00:34:18.149
where do we go from here?

895
00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:20.255
If the things we done in the past

896
00:34:20.255 --> 00:34:22.116
are working for us, let's do a lot of it.

897
00:34:22.116 --> 00:34:23.851
And if they're not working for us anymore,

898
00:34:23.851 --> 00:34:25.425
let's stop and move forward.

899
00:34:25.425 --> 00:34:28.458
When it comes to the human ego,

900
00:34:28.458 --> 00:34:33.105
entire careers, 40, 50 years of textbooks

901
00:34:33.105 --> 00:34:35.192
are based in a story

902
00:34:35.192 --> 00:34:38.500
that is all tied up, it's neat and tidy,

903
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.672
it's the way things have been taught.

904
00:34:40.672 --> 00:34:43.673
And my sense is that a generation

905
00:34:43.673 --> 00:34:45.835
of scientists will have to pass

906
00:34:45.835 --> 00:34:48.799
before this is broadly accepted

907
00:34:48.799 --> 00:34:51.651
in our academics and in the schools,

908
00:34:51.651 --> 00:34:53.480
the idea that civilization is much older

909
00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.691
than we've ever believed,

910
00:34:55.691 --> 00:34:57.720
the ideas of Darwin's theories,

911
00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:58.826
I think all this should be in the past,

912
00:34:58.826 --> 00:34:59.824
but the problem is,

913
00:34:59.824 --> 00:35:01.464
we may not have a generation--

914
00:35:01.464 --> 00:35:02.230
<v Regina>Exactly.</v>

915
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:04.022
<v ->Of time to solve some of the problems.</v>

916
00:35:04.022 --> 00:35:06.802
So what I am proposing and what I would like

917
00:35:06.802 --> 00:35:09.671
to see happen is at least allow

918
00:35:09.671 --> 00:35:12.297
we've got such brilliant minds

919
00:35:12.297 --> 00:35:13.402
in this planet.

920
00:35:13.402 --> 00:35:16.981
Allow them the possibility of exploring an idea

921
00:35:16.981 --> 00:35:21.372
that is outside the bounds of Darwinian theory.

922
00:35:21.372 --> 00:35:24.952
Just explore it and see where it goes.

923
00:35:24.952 --> 00:35:27.751
And if it goes nowhere then we can put an end to it,

924
00:35:27.751 --> 00:35:29.953
and we can say that was not a good idea.

925
00:35:29.953 --> 00:35:33.126
If, however, it gives us answers and maybe

926
00:35:33.126 --> 00:35:35.358
there's a theory that can merge

927
00:35:35.358 --> 00:35:37.432
between the two,

928
00:35:37.432 --> 00:35:40.833
but it all comes down to the way we think about ourselves,

929
00:35:40.833 --> 00:35:43.737
we're looking to science to validate who we are

930
00:35:43.737 --> 00:35:45.608
and based on that validation

931
00:35:45.608 --> 00:35:48.042
we're making the choices of our future

932
00:35:48.042 --> 00:35:49.777
the choices of economics,

933
00:35:49.777 --> 00:35:53.194
do we choose a kind of economics

934
00:35:53.194 --> 00:35:56.738
that is inclusive or that is exclusive to people?

935
00:35:57.658 --> 00:36:00.382
A global population, do we share

936
00:36:00.382 --> 00:36:02.156
the disappearing resources,

937
00:36:02.156 --> 00:36:03.808
do we share the technology?

938
00:36:03.808 --> 00:36:06.184
Do we share energy, the power grid,

939
00:36:06.184 --> 00:36:08.727
do we create a global community,

940
00:36:08.727 --> 00:36:12.364
or do we grab the pieces of the pie

941
00:36:12.364 --> 00:36:15.093
that we think are available for those that can

942
00:36:15.093 --> 00:36:16.730
and for those that can't they're on their own,

943
00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:18.074
and they fend for themselves.

944
00:36:18.074 --> 00:36:22.075
These are the implications of the choices

945
00:36:22.075 --> 00:36:23.312
that are being made right now,

946
00:36:23.312 --> 00:36:24.535
and the choices are being made

947
00:36:24.535 --> 00:36:27.081
through an incomplete, in my opinion,

948
00:36:27.081 --> 00:36:28.782
and incomplete understanding

949
00:36:28.782 --> 00:36:31.510
of who we are, our nature, and our relationship

950
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:32.623
to the world.

951
00:36:32.623 --> 00:36:34.290
We've made those choices in the past,

952
00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:37.027
we have a civilization now, 100 years,

953
00:36:37.027 --> 00:36:39.794
of civilization and we can see

954
00:36:39.794 --> 00:36:42.632
what it has brought to us based on the ideas

955
00:36:42.632 --> 00:36:44.229
of separation,

956
00:36:44.229 --> 00:36:47.391
on the ideas of survival of the fittest,

957
00:36:48.381 --> 00:36:51.988
on the ideas that we have one shot

958
00:36:51.988 --> 00:36:55.001
at civilization, it started here primitively,

959
00:36:55.001 --> 00:36:57.109
it's evolving to here and this is it.

960
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:59.138
When we see ourselves with a history

961
00:36:59.138 --> 00:37:01.216
and a lineage and a cyclic nature,

962
00:37:01.216 --> 00:37:02.350
what we can learn from the past,

963
00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:03.472
it changes everything.

964
00:37:03.472 --> 00:37:04.519
It changes the whole conversation.

965
00:37:05.389 --> 00:37:07.457
So this is why I think this is important.

966
00:37:07.457 --> 00:37:08.691
<v Regina>I agree with you,</v>

967
00:37:08.691 --> 00:37:10.485
I couldn't agree more with you.

968
00:37:10.485 --> 00:37:12.794
And now, let's say that we have a body of people

969
00:37:12.794 --> 00:37:14.559
which is growing by the day,

970
00:37:14.559 --> 00:37:16.788
which is including the people watching this right now,

971
00:37:16.788 --> 00:37:18.260
who are saying we're not waiting for science

972
00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.127
to tell us anything.

973
00:37:19.127 --> 00:37:19.597
<v ->Sure.</v>

974
00:37:19.597 --> 00:37:21.826
<v Regina>We're kind of blowing past science now.</v>

975
00:37:21.826 --> 00:37:24.603
So now, let's talk about how to address that

976
00:37:24.603 --> 00:37:25.670
within ourselves.

977
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:27.426
Where we have to create systems for ourselves.

978
00:37:27.426 --> 00:37:29.268
<v ->I think, absolutely, first of all,</v>

979
00:37:29.268 --> 00:37:30.975
I wanna say science is important.

980
00:37:30.975 --> 00:37:35.149
I'm not discounting science in it's true sense.

981
00:37:35.149 --> 00:37:37.870
It's the way science is being applied.

982
00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:39.417
The way it's being taught

983
00:37:39.417 --> 00:37:41.089
and the business that is growing from science.

984
00:37:41.089 --> 00:37:44.080
So if we stick to science as the language,

985
00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.693
science says you have an idea,

986
00:37:45.693 --> 00:37:47.453
you test the idea,

987
00:37:47.453 --> 00:37:48.694
the tests give you facts,

988
00:37:48.694 --> 00:37:50.325
if the facts support the idea you go with it,

989
00:37:50.325 --> 00:37:52.552
if they don't, you change the idea.

990
00:37:52.552 --> 00:37:54.099
If you don't do that, it's not science.

991
00:37:54.099 --> 00:37:55.734
We're not doing it, so it's not science.

992
00:37:55.734 --> 00:37:57.599
And I wanna be very clear about that,

993
00:37:57.599 --> 00:38:00.841
but without that, I think we all have an intuitive sense,

994
00:38:00.841 --> 00:38:02.832
everyone learns differently.

995
00:38:02.832 --> 00:38:04.006
We all have an intuitive sense

996
00:38:04.006 --> 00:38:05.876
of who we are personally,

997
00:38:05.876 --> 00:38:06.937
our families, our communities,

998
00:38:06.937 --> 00:38:08.543
what our planet is all about,

999
00:38:08.543 --> 00:38:09.914
many of us watching this,

1000
00:38:09.914 --> 00:38:12.120
I think we feel that we're part of a living system,

1001
00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:15.029
that Earth is a living entity.

1002
00:38:15.029 --> 00:38:17.256
That we are an evolving life form

1003
00:38:17.256 --> 00:38:18.053
here on this planet

1004
00:38:18.053 --> 00:38:20.687
about to be birthed into a greater

1005
00:38:20.687 --> 00:38:22.997
sense of unity in life.

1006
00:38:22.997 --> 00:38:25.859
And there are little things that we can do

1007
00:38:25.859 --> 00:38:27.132
everyday in our lives

1008
00:38:27.132 --> 00:38:29.204
that support that kind of unity,

1009
00:38:29.204 --> 00:38:32.005
you don't have to fight the big battles

1010
00:38:32.005 --> 00:38:33.607
to make a difference.

1011
00:38:33.607 --> 00:38:36.507
Little things, every moment of our lives,

1012
00:38:36.507 --> 00:38:38.943
every day we eat,

1013
00:38:38.943 --> 00:38:41.404
we entertain ourselves,

1014
00:38:42.434 --> 00:38:45.441
we make choices in terms of industry and commerce

1015
00:38:45.441 --> 00:38:47.984
and if the way we make all of these choices

1016
00:38:47.984 --> 00:38:51.319
individually, are our collective answer

1017
00:38:51.319 --> 00:38:53.662
to our time in history.

1018
00:38:53.662 --> 00:38:56.922
So when people choose simply to eat organic food

1019
00:38:56.922 --> 00:38:59.166
grown locally in their own backyard,

1020
00:38:59.166 --> 00:39:01.227
rather than relying on a food source

1021
00:39:01.227 --> 00:39:02.599
that's grown halfway around the world

1022
00:39:02.599 --> 00:39:04.938
and the huge carbon footprint on the jet

1023
00:39:04.938 --> 00:39:06.469
that gets it over

1024
00:39:06.469 --> 00:39:10.008
and the corporation has to use a lot of chemicals

1025
00:39:10.008 --> 00:39:13.081
to grow that amount of food to supply the demand.

1026
00:39:13.081 --> 00:39:15.112
Simply buying local, organic,

1027
00:39:15.112 --> 00:39:16.347
you support your friends,

1028
00:39:16.347 --> 00:39:17.449
you support your community,

1029
00:39:17.449 --> 00:39:19.186
if the weather is bad or if there's a war

1030
00:39:19.186 --> 00:39:20.148
and supplies are cut off,

1031
00:39:20.148 --> 00:39:21.179
you still got food to eat,

1032
00:39:21.179 --> 00:39:22.753
it's healthy, you're much better for it.

1033
00:39:22.753 --> 00:39:24.459
That is a big, big choice.

1034
00:39:24.459 --> 00:39:27.982
What kinds of industry and commerce do we support?

1035
00:39:27.982 --> 00:39:30.865
Do we support industry that is,

1036
00:39:30.865 --> 00:39:32.868
that works with integrity?

1037
00:39:32.868 --> 00:39:34.297
Do they honor their employees?

1038
00:39:34.297 --> 00:39:36.471
Is it only about the bottom line

1039
00:39:36.471 --> 00:39:37.401
for that industry

1040
00:39:37.401 --> 00:39:39.540
and is the bottom line supporting

1041
00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:42.338
an emerging, sustainable way of life?

1042
00:39:42.338 --> 00:39:44.705
We look at the things breaking down,

1043
00:39:44.705 --> 00:39:46.341
it's so fascinating for me,

1044
00:39:46.341 --> 00:39:47.343
the only things breaking down

1045
00:39:47.343 --> 00:39:48.918
are the things that are no longer sustainable.

1046
00:39:48.918 --> 00:39:51.710
The economic systems that are no longer sustainable,

1047
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:54.453
the ways that we--

1048
00:39:54.453 --> 00:39:55.455
<v Regina>Consume.</v>

1049
00:39:55.455 --> 00:39:57.722
<v ->Give ourselves the things that we need</v>

1050
00:39:57.722 --> 00:39:59.928
and I'm not saying we need to live primitive lifestyles,

1051
00:39:59.928 --> 00:40:03.256
we can have vehicles that we drive individually

1052
00:40:03.256 --> 00:40:04.530
if we wanna do that,

1053
00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:06.092
and we can have electricity in every home,

1054
00:40:06.092 --> 00:40:06.933
there are just different ways of

1055
00:40:06.933 --> 00:40:08.805
going about getting those things,

1056
00:40:08.805 --> 00:40:10.338
other than what we've done for the last

1057
00:40:10.338 --> 00:40:11.900
100 or 150 years.

1058
00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:15.723
Media, this is very, and this is why I so honor you,

1059
00:40:15.723 --> 00:40:18.175
and I'm always honored to do,

1060
00:40:18.175 --> 00:40:20.173
when I look on my itinerary and I see

1061
00:40:20.173 --> 00:40:21.413
that we have an interview coming up,

1062
00:40:21.413 --> 00:40:22.985
I always get a big smile on my face

1063
00:40:22.985 --> 00:40:24.054
when I'm thinking about it--
<v Regina>Me too.</v>

1064
00:40:24.054 --> 00:40:25.115
<v ->Because you do a beautiful job</v>

1065
00:40:25.115 --> 00:40:26.185
and you're very honoring.

1066
00:40:26.185 --> 00:40:27.006
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1067
00:40:27.006 --> 00:40:29.993
<v ->Of your guests, you're a gracious interviewer,</v>

1068
00:40:29.993 --> 00:40:33.128
but you are an example of conscious media.

1069
00:40:33.128 --> 00:40:35.864
And conscious media is so important

1070
00:40:35.864 --> 00:40:37.814
because there's a growing body

1071
00:40:37.814 --> 00:40:39.591
of scientific evidence now

1072
00:40:39.591 --> 00:40:42.900
that suggests that the images we surround ourselves with,

1073
00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:46.036
the conversations that we engage in

1074
00:40:47.296 --> 00:40:49.166
quickly become the reality of our lives

1075
00:40:49.166 --> 00:40:50.910
and our world.

1076
00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:51.944
And I'm not saying it's right, wrong,

1077
00:40:51.944 --> 00:40:53.237
good, or bad, either,

1078
00:40:53.237 --> 00:40:54.811
but what I'm saying is,

1079
00:40:54.811 --> 00:40:55.840
if we surround ourselves

1080
00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.821
only with frightening images of war

1081
00:40:57.821 --> 00:41:00.773
and violence and blood and

1082
00:41:00.773 --> 00:41:05.207
lustful relationships that don't honor the promises

1083
00:41:05.207 --> 00:41:06.555
and commitments we've made in our lives,

1084
00:41:06.555 --> 00:41:08.318
if that's all that we're surrounded with,

1085
00:41:08.318 --> 00:41:09.832
I wouldn't be surprised to see those things

1086
00:41:09.832 --> 00:41:11.731
in the reality of our world.

1087
00:41:11.731 --> 00:41:13.900
It's important to balance those things,

1088
00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:17.894
with life affirming images and programming

1089
00:41:17.894 --> 00:41:20.062
of hope and possibility,

1090
00:41:20.062 --> 00:41:21.843
at least balance those things out.

1091
00:41:21.843 --> 00:41:23.863
So conscious media,

1092
00:41:24.913 --> 00:41:27.246
playable transformation, social transformation,

1093
00:41:27.246 --> 00:41:29.417
is peace being taught in our schools

1094
00:41:29.417 --> 00:41:31.084
and educational systems.

1095
00:41:31.084 --> 00:41:33.316
When I was in school

1096
00:41:33.316 --> 00:41:36.046
I was taught that war is good for business.

1097
00:41:36.046 --> 00:41:38.236
And I have worked with publishers

1098
00:41:38.236 --> 00:41:40.194
in the past that have said to me,

1099
00:41:40.194 --> 00:41:41.756
Gregg you can write any book you want,

1100
00:41:41.756 --> 00:41:44.265
but please don't ever bring me a book of peace.

1101
00:41:44.265 --> 00:41:45.888
Because peace doesn't sell.

1102
00:41:45.888 --> 00:41:49.397
And this is the kind of languaging that has been used

1103
00:41:49.397 --> 00:41:50.771
in the industry in the past,

1104
00:41:50.771 --> 00:41:53.174
now I'm with a very conscious publisher right now,

1105
00:41:53.174 --> 00:41:54.677
Hay House Publishing,

1106
00:41:54.677 --> 00:41:56.840
who gives back to the community

1107
00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.337
and is open to all possibilities

1108
00:41:58.337 --> 00:42:00.615
and supports the new ideas

1109
00:42:00.615 --> 00:42:03.448
and the emerging, life affirming kinds of things

1110
00:42:03.448 --> 00:42:05.354
that we can do in our lives,

1111
00:42:05.354 --> 00:42:08.118
but all of these choices,

1112
00:42:08.118 --> 00:42:10.150
peace can be an industry,

1113
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:12.659
and it can be a viable, profitable industry,

1114
00:42:12.659 --> 00:42:14.263
nothing wrong with making money

1115
00:42:14.263 --> 00:42:15.996
from peaceful endeavors,

1116
00:42:15.996 --> 00:42:18.896
so for example, if we took all of the unemployed,

1117
00:42:18.896 --> 00:42:20.066
not just the United States

1118
00:42:20.066 --> 00:42:22.067
but of the planet right now,

1119
00:42:22.067 --> 00:42:25.605
and we had the leaders of our nations

1120
00:42:25.605 --> 00:42:27.232
that did the same thing John Kennedy did

1121
00:42:27.232 --> 00:42:29.070
in the early 60's, he said we're gonna be

1122
00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:30.368
in the moon in 10 years,

1123
00:42:30.368 --> 00:42:31.942
we were ahead of the schedule,

1124
00:42:31.942 --> 00:42:33.343
it took less than 10 years,

1125
00:42:33.343 --> 00:42:35.046
the technology was already there.

1126
00:42:35.046 --> 00:42:37.320
No one had ever given the directive

1127
00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:39.318
and said make this happen.

1128
00:42:39.318 --> 00:42:40.549
If the leaders of our world

1129
00:42:40.549 --> 00:42:42.657
would come together and say

1130
00:42:42.657 --> 00:42:44.861
we are gonna take our unemployed,

1131
00:42:44.861 --> 00:42:48.992
and rather than evolve a new civilization over time,

1132
00:42:48.992 --> 00:42:51.897
we are going to take this year and next year,

1133
00:42:51.897 --> 00:42:55.233
and we're going to wean this planet from fossil fuels,

1134
00:42:55.233 --> 00:42:57.007
we're gonna take all of the unemployed,

1135
00:42:57.007 --> 00:42:59.050
and we're gonna build the most amazing,

1136
00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:00.012
wind generators.

1137
00:43:00.012 --> 00:43:01.843
We're gonna build solar panels where there's sun,

1138
00:43:01.843 --> 00:43:03.979
where there's not, we're gonna use wave energy.

1139
00:43:03.979 --> 00:43:05.305
Where there's not, we're gonna tie it into

1140
00:43:05.305 --> 00:43:06.774
a power grid that everyone can share,

1141
00:43:06.774 --> 00:43:10.110
we can do that, that is an organism working together,

1142
00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:11.918
and this is the way biology in nature

1143
00:43:11.918 --> 00:43:13.385
shows us that we work,

1144
00:43:13.385 --> 00:43:15.757
so these are possibilites

1145
00:43:15.757 --> 00:43:17.376
that could happen,

1146
00:43:17.376 --> 00:43:18.589
but before they happen,

1147
00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:20.861
we need to see a need.

1148
00:43:20.861 --> 00:43:22.996
And before we see a need we've got to be very clear

1149
00:43:22.996 --> 00:43:24.963
on who we are in our relationship to the world

1150
00:43:24.963 --> 00:43:26.522
and all that's changing now.

1151
00:43:26.522 --> 00:43:28.661
<v Regina>So 2011, we're going to do,</v>

1152
00:43:28.661 --> 00:43:30.970
let's do the last little bit on the time code

1153
00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:33.041
and we have one more quick question for you,

1154
00:43:33.041 --> 00:43:36.322
'cause I know you have catch a plane.

1155
00:43:36.952 --> 00:43:39.399
<v ->I have to go create a carbon footprint</v>

1156
00:43:39.399 --> 00:43:39.943
to go somewhere.

1157
00:43:39.943 --> 00:43:41.142
<v Regina>Indeed you do.</v>

1158
00:43:41.142 --> 00:43:42.148
(laughing)

1159
00:43:42.148 --> 00:43:42.818
<v ->Sorry.</v>

1160
00:43:42.818 --> 00:43:45.151
<v Regina>So by the time code calculation,</v>

1161
00:43:45.151 --> 00:43:47.455
2011 is a pivotal year,

1162
00:43:47.455 --> 00:43:49.688
having to do with the economies,

1163
00:43:49.688 --> 00:43:51.757
tying back into the great depression,

1164
00:43:51.757 --> 00:43:53.895
having to do with the potential for war,

1165
00:43:53.895 --> 00:43:55.822
but also the potential to end.

1166
00:43:55.822 --> 00:43:57.561
And that I loved last night.

1167
00:43:57.561 --> 00:43:59.860
<v ->In previous programs we've talked about</v>

1168
00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:01.836
a book that was released 2009,

1169
00:44:01.836 --> 00:44:03.866
it was called Fractal Time.

1170
00:44:03.866 --> 00:44:05.441
And Fractal Time,

1171
00:44:05.441 --> 00:44:06.835
of the many things it describes,

1172
00:44:06.835 --> 00:44:09.465
it's based on the principles that

1173
00:44:10.535 --> 00:44:13.935
that the events of life and nature

1174
00:44:13.935 --> 00:44:17.710
are cyclic and they follow rhythms

1175
00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:20.154
that are very simple to calculate.

1176
00:44:20.154 --> 00:44:22.857
They don't predict exactly what's going to happen,

1177
00:44:22.857 --> 00:44:26.914
they say that the conditions that lead to climate change

1178
00:44:26.914 --> 00:44:28.724
or the conditions that lead to war

1179
00:44:28.724 --> 00:44:29.694
or an economic collapse,

1180
00:44:29.694 --> 00:44:32.011
those conditions repeat.

1181
00:44:32.011 --> 00:44:34.334
The choices we make within those conditions

1182
00:44:34.334 --> 00:44:35.737
determine what happens.

1183
00:44:35.737 --> 00:44:37.499
But the conditions are there.

1184
00:44:37.499 --> 00:44:38.605
So based on that,

1185
00:44:38.605 --> 00:44:39.604
we can go back and look

1186
00:44:39.604 --> 00:44:43.068
at key events in the past that define our lives

1187
00:44:43.068 --> 00:44:44.271
and our world today,

1188
00:44:44.271 --> 00:44:46.375
and we can look at those events

1189
00:44:46.375 --> 00:44:48.482
such as global war, economic collapse,

1190
00:44:48.482 --> 00:44:51.943
and peace, and we can see when those cycles

1191
00:44:51.943 --> 00:44:54.018
or when these cycles for those things

1192
00:44:54.018 --> 00:44:54.854
repeat.

1193
00:44:54.854 --> 00:44:57.092
And what's so interesting in what you're referring to now,

1194
00:44:57.092 --> 00:44:58.948
is this is the year 2011,

1195
00:44:58.948 --> 00:45:02.459
and some of the greatest crisis

1196
00:45:02.459 --> 00:45:03.821
that precipitated

1197
00:45:03.821 --> 00:45:06.329
the suffering of the 20th century,

1198
00:45:06.329 --> 00:45:08.794
that happened in different years,

1199
00:45:08.794 --> 00:45:11.631
those cycles are converging in the year 2011.

1200
00:45:11.631 --> 00:45:14.673
So 1914 was the first year for global war

1201
00:45:14.673 --> 00:45:15.974
in the modern world,

1202
00:45:15.974 --> 00:45:18.841
2011 is the year that cycle repeats.

1203
00:45:18.841 --> 00:45:22.114
1929, first global economic collapse,

1204
00:45:22.114 --> 00:45:24.287
2011 that cycle repeats.

1205
00:45:24.287 --> 00:45:27.480
1945 was the end of the second world war,

1206
00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.883
the second global war and the beginning of

1207
00:45:29.883 --> 00:45:31.321
a relative era of peace,

1208
00:45:31.321 --> 00:45:33.025
that cycle repeats.

1209
00:45:33.025 --> 00:45:35.328
The beauty of knowing all of these things

1210
00:45:35.328 --> 00:45:36.950
is that when one cycle ends before

1211
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:38.401
the next opens,

1212
00:45:38.401 --> 00:45:39.732
there's a window of opportunity

1213
00:45:39.732 --> 00:45:41.399
called the choice point.

1214
00:45:41.399 --> 00:45:42.371
And that choice point

1215
00:45:42.371 --> 00:45:44.295
is when our choices

1216
00:45:44.295 --> 00:45:47.806
become even more potent than they normally are.

1217
00:45:47.806 --> 00:45:49.306
We can always make choices,

1218
00:45:49.306 --> 00:45:50.800
but this is a window of opportunity

1219
00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.414
when we stack the deck in our favor,

1220
00:45:52.414 --> 00:45:54.899
and our choices have a greater potency.

1221
00:45:54.899 --> 00:45:59.743
So 2011 is a year when the cycle

1222
00:45:59.743 --> 00:46:01.956
that carries the conditions

1223
00:46:01.956 --> 00:46:04.252
that have defined so much of our world

1224
00:46:04.252 --> 00:46:05.945
in the last 100 years repeats.

1225
00:46:05.945 --> 00:46:08.817
Cycles of economic collapse,

1226
00:46:08.817 --> 00:46:10.783
war and suffering,

1227
00:46:10.783 --> 00:46:14.136
but it also means that the cycle that began

1228
00:46:14.136 --> 00:46:15.998
the relative era of peace

1229
00:46:15.998 --> 00:46:17.038
also repeats,

1230
00:46:17.038 --> 00:46:18.634
and every one of those cycles

1231
00:46:18.634 --> 00:46:21.477
because they end in 2011 and the next one begins,

1232
00:46:21.477 --> 00:46:24.777
it means 2011 is a window of choice points

1233
00:46:24.777 --> 00:46:26.273
unlike any that we've seen

1234
00:46:26.273 --> 00:46:28.551
in recorded human history

1235
00:46:28.551 --> 00:46:30.175
for the last 5,000 years.

1236
00:46:30.175 --> 00:46:32.984
We have the opportunity to make the choices

1237
00:46:32.984 --> 00:46:34.822
to redefine the patterns of the past

1238
00:46:34.822 --> 00:46:36.453
before they begin again,

1239
00:46:36.453 --> 00:46:38.425
and this may be what our indigenous ancestors

1240
00:46:38.425 --> 00:46:41.358
were so excited about for 2012.

1241
00:46:41.358 --> 00:46:43.395
2012 is not the end of the world,

1242
00:46:43.395 --> 00:46:46.633
it's the end of a world age and a way of being.

1243
00:46:46.633 --> 00:46:51.001
2012 is the beginning of a new way of being

1244
00:46:51.001 --> 00:46:54.733
and it implys, if that's the beginning of the new way,

1245
00:46:54.733 --> 00:46:57.934
that all the changes must be in place before 2012 gets here.

1246
00:46:57.934 --> 00:47:00.874
So I think 2011 is a pivotal year

1247
00:47:00.874 --> 00:47:02.383
for us in our world.

1248
00:47:02.383 --> 00:47:03.040
<v Regina>I feel it.</v>

1249
00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:04.473
And people around,

1250
00:47:04.473 --> 00:47:06.644
the people that we surround ourselves with,

1251
00:47:06.644 --> 00:47:08.314
everybody can feel the truth

1252
00:47:08.314 --> 00:47:09.519
in what you say,

1253
00:47:09.519 --> 00:47:11.918
now this final question is,

1254
00:47:11.918 --> 00:47:13.495
overlay the Isaiah Effect,

1255
00:47:13.495 --> 00:47:16.288
overlay the tipping point with the choice point.

1256
00:47:16.288 --> 00:47:18.381
<v ->Sure, well the Isaiah Effect was a book</v>

1257
00:47:18.381 --> 00:47:19.417
that was written in 1998,

1258
00:47:19.417 --> 00:47:21.577
released in 2000.

1259
00:47:21.577 --> 00:47:23.527
<v Regina>This whole notion of the tipping point</v>

1260
00:47:23.527 --> 00:47:25.229
happening at a choice point.

1261
00:47:25.229 --> 00:47:29.741
<v ->Sure, it references the lineage of wisdom</v>

1262
00:47:29.741 --> 00:47:31.547
that links our modern world

1263
00:47:31.547 --> 00:47:33.044
with the past.

1264
00:47:33.044 --> 00:47:34.231
That lineage has been broken

1265
00:47:34.231 --> 00:47:35.983
a couple of times in history

1266
00:47:35.983 --> 00:47:37.297
and each time it's broken

1267
00:47:37.297 --> 00:47:39.114
we lose information about ourselves

1268
00:47:39.114 --> 00:47:40.847
and now we're recovering that information

1269
00:47:40.847 --> 00:47:42.187
in places like the Dead Sea Scrolls,

1270
00:47:42.187 --> 00:47:43.792
the (inaudible) Library,

1271
00:47:43.792 --> 00:47:46.130
and the bottom line to that information,

1272
00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:48.357
is it is the information that was lost

1273
00:47:48.357 --> 00:47:50.062
is the very information that tells us

1274
00:47:50.062 --> 00:47:52.226
how to choose in a choice bind.

1275
00:47:52.226 --> 00:47:54.333
How to tip the scales of life and balance

1276
00:47:54.333 --> 00:47:56.096
in our favor and peace.

1277
00:47:56.096 --> 00:47:57.202
In our favor.

1278
00:47:57.202 --> 00:47:58.761
And I think it's no accident,

1279
00:47:58.761 --> 00:48:01.038
that all of this is happening all at once.

1280
00:48:01.038 --> 00:48:05.472
It's only now at the end of a 5,125 year long

1281
00:48:05.472 --> 00:48:07.771
world age cycle,

1282
00:48:07.771 --> 00:48:09.378
that began the biblical era,

1283
00:48:09.378 --> 00:48:11.308
it's only now at the end of that cycle,

1284
00:48:11.308 --> 00:48:13.050
when we're faced with the greatest number

1285
00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:15.150
and the greatest magnitude of crisis

1286
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:18.392
ever to face humankind in recorded human history,

1287
00:48:18.392 --> 00:48:20.749
on one hand that looks pretty scary,

1288
00:48:20.749 --> 00:48:23.530
on the other hand, that our own science

1289
00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:25.556
is now coming full circle,

1290
00:48:25.556 --> 00:48:27.926
and if we honor what science is telling us,

1291
00:48:27.926 --> 00:48:29.938
it's telling us that we're part of the world

1292
00:48:29.938 --> 00:48:30.997
rather than separate from it,

1293
00:48:30.997 --> 00:48:32.168
we've been here for a long time,

1294
00:48:32.168 --> 00:48:34.073
we have the experience to deal with these things

1295
00:48:34.073 --> 00:48:37.411
and get through it if we learn the lessons

1296
00:48:37.411 --> 00:48:39.578
of the past and honor what the science

1297
00:48:39.578 --> 00:48:41.513
is actually telling us.

1298
00:48:41.513 --> 00:48:43.712
And there is an intelligence that underlies

1299
00:48:43.712 --> 00:48:45.488
our physical reality and our bodies.

1300
00:48:45.488 --> 00:48:48.078
When we work in harmony with that intelligence,

1301
00:48:48.078 --> 00:48:50.325
things seem to go a lot, lot better.

1302
00:48:50.325 --> 00:48:53.788
And I think this is the lesson that's happening now

1303
00:48:53.788 --> 00:48:55.428
at this time,

1304
00:48:55.428 --> 00:48:57.659
and this is the significance of understanding

1305
00:48:57.659 --> 00:49:00.699
the deep truths of our lives.

1306
00:49:00.699 --> 00:49:03.586
The title of the new book is called Deep Truth.

1307
00:49:03.586 --> 00:49:05.273
And it's based on the statement that

1308
00:49:05.273 --> 00:49:08.301
Niels Bohr, the 20th century physicist,

1309
00:49:08.301 --> 00:49:10.578
Nobel Prize winning physicist,

1310
00:49:11.858 --> 00:49:13.994
that worked on the Manhattan Project

1311
00:49:13.994 --> 00:49:15.045
among others,

1312
00:49:15.045 --> 00:49:17.120
that he mentioned in a conversation

1313
00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.977
that he was having with other physicists,

1314
00:49:18.977 --> 00:49:20.285
and what he said was this,

1315
00:49:20.285 --> 00:49:23.982
he said it's the hallmark of any deep truth

1316
00:49:24.912 --> 00:49:28.828
that it's negation is also a deep truth.

1317
00:49:28.828 --> 00:49:30.392
And what he's saying is,

1318
00:49:30.392 --> 00:49:33.832
when we find something that we cling to

1319
00:49:33.832 --> 00:49:36.003
because we believe it's true,

1320
00:49:37.133 --> 00:49:39.539
and then we find a new fact

1321
00:49:39.539 --> 00:49:43.409
that tells us that that truth no longer exists,

1322
00:49:44.619 --> 00:49:48.279
the new truth is also a deep truth

1323
00:49:49.059 --> 00:49:50.878
even though it may be the opposite

1324
00:49:50.878 --> 00:49:52.855
of the original truth.

1325
00:49:52.855 --> 00:49:56.147
The example that we began this conversation with

1326
00:49:56.147 --> 00:49:59.517
the theory in 1887,

1327
00:49:59.517 --> 00:50:02.263
that there's a field of energy that connects all things,

1328
00:50:02.263 --> 00:50:03.855
scientists said it doesn't exist,

1329
00:50:03.855 --> 00:50:05.197
that was a deep truth.

1330
00:50:05.197 --> 00:50:05.900
For 100 years,

1331
00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:07.462
all of our science based on what we believed

1332
00:50:07.462 --> 00:50:08.269
was the deep truth,

1333
00:50:08.269 --> 00:50:09.594
that everything is separate from everything else,

1334
00:50:09.594 --> 00:50:12.474
there's no field of energy connecting anything.

1335
00:50:12.474 --> 00:50:15.306
1987, the field is found to be true.

1336
00:50:15.306 --> 00:50:16.743
That's different than the original truth,

1337
00:50:16.743 --> 00:50:18.878
but that is a deep truth unto itself.

1338
00:50:18.878 --> 00:50:21.975
And that's a beautiful example of a deep truth

1339
00:50:21.975 --> 00:50:24.805
and how it's opposite is also a deep truth,

1340
00:50:24.805 --> 00:50:27.340
and I think 2011 is the year of deep truths.

1341
00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:31.402
Where the things that we've held dearly

1342
00:50:31.723 --> 00:50:35.503
and clung to, ferociously, in some cases,

1343
00:50:36.019 --> 00:50:38.932
that describe who we are are being redefined,

1344
00:50:38.932 --> 00:50:40.665
and we get to find out who we really are

1345
00:50:40.665 --> 00:50:42.398
and in the presence of who we are,

1346
00:50:42.398 --> 00:50:44.704
the crisis took on a whole new meaning.

1347
00:50:44.704 --> 00:50:46.905
And our role in those crisis takes on

1348
00:50:46.905 --> 00:50:48.806
a new meaning, everything changes.

1349
00:50:48.806 --> 00:50:51.177
and I think this is what our ancestors saw coming for us.

1350
00:50:51.177 --> 00:50:53.410
They said that the end of this world age,

1351
00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:56.044
when we look back and the one lifetime

1352
00:50:56.044 --> 00:50:57.814
that straddles the two worlds,

1353
00:50:57.814 --> 00:50:59.356
we won't recognize ourselves,

1354
00:50:59.356 --> 00:51:01.973
we won't recognize our lives,

1355
00:51:01.973 --> 00:51:04.019
and our world, and I think we can say that

1356
00:51:04.019 --> 00:51:05.625
right now, we're very different

1357
00:51:05.625 --> 00:51:07.323
that we were 10 years ago.

1358
00:51:07.323 --> 00:51:08.261
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

1359
00:51:08.261 --> 00:51:09.259
<v ->Our world is very different.</v>

1360
00:51:09.259 --> 00:51:10.895
I'm an optimist.

1361
00:51:10.895 --> 00:51:12.763
And I believe we're going someplace

1362
00:51:12.763 --> 00:51:14.938
really beautiful,

1363
00:51:14.938 --> 00:51:16.694
but I'm also a realist,

1364
00:51:16.694 --> 00:51:18.377
and for whatever reason,

1365
00:51:18.377 --> 00:51:20.200
we've taken a very secularist route

1366
00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:21.571
to get there.

1367
00:51:21.571 --> 00:51:23.706
Why we didn't simply choose

1368
00:51:23.706 --> 00:51:25.536
a way of living and say let's do it,

1369
00:51:26.736 --> 00:51:29.914
rather than bumping up against global war

1370
00:51:29.914 --> 00:51:31.313
and say, oh, we don't like that,

1371
00:51:31.313 --> 00:51:33.011
and bumping up against holocaust

1372
00:51:33.011 --> 00:51:34.856
and say, oh, we don't like that,

1373
00:51:34.856 --> 00:51:37.856
and global economic collapse, oh, we don't like that,

1374
00:51:37.856 --> 00:51:39.693
but we seem to learn by experiencing

1375
00:51:39.693 --> 00:51:41.217
what we don't want before we know

1376
00:51:41.217 --> 00:51:42.192
we don't want it.

1377
00:51:42.192 --> 00:51:43.137
<v Regina>Indeed.</v>

1378
00:51:43.137 --> 00:51:45.323
<v ->Okay, and I believe that where we find ourselves now,</v>

1379
00:51:46.413 --> 00:51:50.390
is exploring the truths of what is,

1380
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:54.986
and I believe, I believe in our hearts,

1381
00:51:56.076 --> 00:51:59.606
and I believe in our power of change,

1382
00:51:59.606 --> 00:52:01.213
and I believe that we love one another,

1383
00:52:01.213 --> 00:52:02.352
we may not always like one another,

1384
00:52:02.352 --> 00:52:03.306
but we love one another

1385
00:52:03.306 --> 00:52:04.739
on this planet and I believe our love

1386
00:52:04.739 --> 00:52:07.454
will carry us through to a beautiful new world.

1387
00:52:07.454 --> 00:52:10.151
We've got to get through the transition.

1388
00:52:10.151 --> 00:52:12.324
And that transition is what we're living right now.

1389
00:52:12.324 --> 00:52:13.482
<v Regina>Is now.</v>

1390
00:52:14.102 --> 00:52:16.251
Thank you so much for taking time today.

1391
00:52:16.251 --> 00:52:17.361
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1392
00:52:18.901 --> 00:52:20.500
<v ->For any of you who have not read his book</v>

1393
00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:22.891
Fractal Time, you might wanna pick up a copy.

1394
00:52:22.891 --> 00:52:24.063
I've been following his work

1395
00:52:24.063 --> 00:52:25.670
for more than 15 years now,

1396
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:28.333
and find a beautiful flow to his discoveries.

1397
00:52:28.333 --> 00:52:30.237
You might also want to watch my last two interviews

1398
00:52:30.237 --> 00:52:32.902
of Gregg as well for a quick sketch of his work.

1399
00:52:32.902 --> 00:52:35.996
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1400
00:52:37.545 --> 00:52:40.465
(peaceful music)
