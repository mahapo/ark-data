00:00:00.851 --> 00:00:03.851
<v ->John Jay Harper is a camera shy mystic</v>

2
00:00:03.851 --> 00:00:07.231
who has put the big picture together in uncanny ways.

3
00:00:07.231 --> 00:00:08.951
With a career in education

4
00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:11.791
grounded in the hard sciences and psychology,

5
00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:13.771
he had a life altering event

6
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:17.091
that challenged him to rethink the nature of reality.

7
00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:20.031
For the past 10 years, he's been lecturing and writing

8
00:00:20.031 --> 00:00:22.471
about his discoveries and revelations

9
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:24.762
including what lies ahead for the earth.

10
00:00:33.812 --> 00:00:35.572
You were a former engineer

11
00:00:35.572 --> 00:00:38.392
and research scientist with the Department of Defense,

12
00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:41.452
that's a pretty left brain endeavor.

13
00:00:41.452 --> 00:00:43.592
How did you end up writing a book

14
00:00:43.592 --> 00:00:47.702
called Tranceformers, T-R-A-N-C-E

15
00:00:47.702 --> 00:00:49.653
Shamans of the 21st century?

16
00:00:49.653 --> 00:00:50.533
<v ->That's right.</v>

17
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:51.837
<v Voiceover>Yeah, what was the link?</v>

18
00:00:51.837 --> 00:00:54.828
What happened in your life that created this leap?

19
00:00:56.238 --> 00:01:00.449
<v ->I woke one morning at 4 AM in June of 1988</v>

20
00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.099
and standing in front me was a deceased friend

21
00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.080
colleauge who was a physicist

22
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.600
and he had died six months prior

23
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.032
and shook my left brain to the ground.

24
00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:18.002
<v Voiceover>No, not just a colleague,</v>

25
00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:20.342
he was a really close friend of yours too, wasn't he?

26
00:01:20.342 --> 00:01:22.557
<v ->Yes, his name was George Vegay.</v>

27
00:01:22.557 --> 00:01:25.803
He was born in Plaquemine, Louisiana.

28
00:01:27.508 --> 00:01:29.153
He and I had served in the US Army together

29
00:01:29.153 --> 00:01:31.113
during the Vietnam time.

30
00:01:31.113 --> 00:01:32.913
Although, we bought did not go to Vietnam

31
00:01:32.913 --> 00:01:34.733
and went to Europe.

32
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:37.092
But back then, it was a pretty stressful activity

33
00:01:37.092 --> 00:01:39.132
anyway to be in Southern Germany

34
00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:40.692
and preparing for the cold war

35
00:01:40.692 --> 00:01:44.033
because we were on the Czechoslovakian border.

36
00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:46.399
And, so we had some very good times

37
00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.400
and some very intense times

38
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.120
but overall we served our years together

39
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.060
then came back and went to college

40
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.640
at the University of Alabama

41
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.680
where he studied physics

42
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.080
and I began as electronics engineer.

43
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.920
<v Voiceover>And you also studied physics, by the way,</v>

44
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.240
as you have grounding in physics.

45
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.520
<v ->Iâ€™m a generalist in the sciences,</v>

46
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.240
I have a love for them just intuitively.

47
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.300
As a child, my teacher would ask me,

48
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.140
"John, what do you wanna be when you grow up?"

49
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.231
And I said, "A rocket scientist."

50
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:18.941
Uninterestingly enough, I ended up working

51
00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:20.341
in the Marshall Space Flight Center Area

52
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:22.005
of Huntsville, Alabama

53
00:02:22.005 --> 00:02:24.485
during the Wernher von Braun years.

54
00:02:24.485 --> 00:02:27.720
And so I've been on the fringe of that.

55
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.667
Connie, actually my wife,

56
00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:32.227
served in many different capacities as secretary,

57
00:02:32.227 --> 00:02:33.670
somebody's very senior people

58
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.315
and actually had seen some of the astronauts

59
00:02:35.315 --> 00:02:37.306
very up close at times.

60
00:02:38.016 --> 00:02:40.336
<v Voiceover>So you reach that dream and then,</v>

61
00:02:40.336 --> 00:02:42.276
so here is your deceased friend

62
00:02:42.276 --> 00:02:43.856
standing at the end of your bed

63
00:02:43.856 --> 00:02:45.516
at four o'clock in the morning,

64
00:02:45.516 --> 00:02:48.087
okay, so what happened after that?

65
00:02:49.077 --> 00:02:51.077
<v ->Initially, I thought it was a lucid dream.</v>

66
00:02:51.077 --> 00:02:54.917
I was starting to kinda shake the cobwebs out of my mind

67
00:02:54.917 --> 00:02:57.717
but I realize that it was a projection of some sort,

68
00:02:57.717 --> 00:03:01.677
it was an image that was alive, that was vibrant.

69
00:03:01.677 --> 00:03:03.957
It was shimmering and yet it was solid.

70
00:03:03.957 --> 00:03:08.928
There was a very holographic whole image picture to it.

71
00:03:10.818 --> 00:03:13.358
Then I looked at his face

72
00:03:13.358 --> 00:03:15.518
and I saw him smile at me.

73
00:03:15.518 --> 00:03:17.698
And we made eye contact

74
00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:21.138
and there was like a telepathic feeling,

75
00:03:21.138 --> 00:03:22.238
more than just thoughts,

76
00:03:22.238 --> 00:03:25.289
there was energy being transferred between us.

77
00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:28.791
And I,

78
00:03:30.801 --> 00:03:33.341
I've never been to same since.

79
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:35.491
<v Voiceover>So with that information, did he</v>

80
00:03:35.491 --> 00:03:38.282
attempt to communicate anything specific to you

81
00:03:38.282 --> 00:03:42.242
or did his mere presence catapult you on to

82
00:03:42.242 --> 00:03:45.542
a very deep and long line of inquiry?

83
00:03:45.542 --> 00:03:49.202
<v ->Two things happened to me from that experience.</v>

84
00:03:49.202 --> 00:03:53.682
One, I saw him in a very comical way of sorts,

85
00:03:53.682 --> 00:03:56.102
he had a beachcomber hat on

86
00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:58.582
in a Hawaiian luau shirt.

87
00:03:58.582 --> 00:04:00.342
Now we had been together in the south,

88
00:04:00.342 --> 00:04:04.122
so that wasn't too uncommon, I guess, I mean,

89
00:04:04.122 --> 00:04:06.462
you dress a lot lighter in the Southeastern

90
00:04:06.462 --> 00:04:08.702
US, Florida, Georgia, Alabama

91
00:04:08.702 --> 00:04:11.823
and he was from Louisiana.

92
00:04:11.823 --> 00:04:14.724
But he had metal beer cans in the hatband

93
00:04:14.724 --> 00:04:15.826
of his beachcomber hat.

94
00:04:15.826 --> 00:04:17.486
<v Voiceover>I've seen that artwork before.</v>

95
00:04:17.486 --> 00:04:18.426
<v ->Yeah.</v>

96
00:04:18.426 --> 00:04:23.148
And so, to myself, I got kind of it in a way I was shocked,

97
00:04:23.148 --> 00:04:25.828
but there's also a comical edge to it.

98
00:04:25.828 --> 00:04:27.508
But then about a year later,

99
00:04:27.508 --> 00:04:28.948
when I started really reflect,

100
00:04:28.948 --> 00:04:32.188
'cause it consumed me everyday from that point on,

101
00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:35.428
I kept thinking, what in the world has happened to me?

102
00:04:35.428 --> 00:04:37.548
And how could this be possible?

103
00:04:37.548 --> 00:04:40.148
You know, I'm a scientist of sort

104
00:04:40.148 --> 00:04:42.588
but I'm also a psychologist of sorts.

105
00:04:42.588 --> 00:04:45.460
I've studied both of these disciplines at great length.

106
00:04:46.827 --> 00:04:48.926
And what I realized was

107
00:04:48.926 --> 00:04:52.347
that when I was in the funeral home in Huntsville, Alabama

108
00:04:52.347 --> 00:04:54.551
in November of 1987,

109
00:04:56.001 --> 00:05:00.381
I walked up to the front of the funeral home

110
00:05:00.381 --> 00:05:03.001
and I looked down in the casket

111
00:05:03.001 --> 00:05:05.221
and I said into my mind

112
00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:07.780
'cause there's a lot people present, but in my mind,

113
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.440
I looked at George and I said,

114
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.025
"George, a joke is a joke, let's go get a beer."

115
00:05:13.475 --> 00:05:14.769
<v Voiceover>So I guess he must have shown up</v>

116
00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:16.688
ready to get a beer with you.

117
00:05:16.688 --> 00:05:19.048
<v ->What I realized, Regina, was</v>

118
00:05:19.048 --> 00:05:20.448
about a year later,

119
00:05:20.448 --> 00:05:21.989
that he had read my mind

120
00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:23.989
that he was not deceased,

121
00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:27.152
and that that was the confirmation that I needed

122
00:05:27.152 --> 00:05:29.732
to go forward and research the phenomenon

123
00:05:29.732 --> 00:05:30.832
of nearr death experience,

124
00:05:30.832 --> 00:05:32.812
mysticism and shamanism,

125
00:05:32.812 --> 00:05:34.532
so that was the catalyst.

126
00:05:34.532 --> 00:05:36.372
I realized it was not a joke,

127
00:05:36.372 --> 00:05:37.652
it was not an illusion,

128
00:05:37.652 --> 00:05:40.312
it was a communication from a person

129
00:05:40.312 --> 00:05:42.332
that supposedly was dead.

130
00:05:42.332 --> 00:05:44.992
<v Voiceover>So where did that take you in your research?</v>

131
00:05:44.992 --> 00:05:47.305
On near death experience and

132
00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:49.615
well, afterlife experience?

133
00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:52.615
<v ->The first thing I did was I became a voracious reader</v>

134
00:05:52.615 --> 00:05:54.515
of everything metaphysical.

135
00:05:54.515 --> 00:05:58.135
I had never picked up a metaphysical book in my life.

136
00:05:58.135 --> 00:06:00.615
Textbooks, electronics, physics,

137
00:06:00.615 --> 00:06:02.675
biology, chemistry.

138
00:06:02.675 --> 00:06:05.946
Sure, but nothing about metaphysics.

139
00:06:07.156 --> 00:06:08.876
So I read everything that was there

140
00:06:08.876 --> 00:06:10.136
and it wasn't too much back,

141
00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:12.347
this is late 1980's when I began.

142
00:06:13.657 --> 00:06:15.657
Doctor Kenneth Ring at the University of Connecticut

143
00:06:15.657 --> 00:06:17.997
had his book out.

144
00:06:17.997 --> 00:06:19.417
<v Voiceover>Had Doctor Moody done his work yet?</v>

145
00:06:19.417 --> 00:06:22.257
<v ->Yes, 1976, Life After Life.</v>

146
00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:25.357
Absolutely, I read those classics.

147
00:06:25.357 --> 00:06:26.857
Then they started to,

148
00:06:26.857 --> 00:06:29.217
there was an explosion of books on this topic

149
00:06:29.217 --> 00:06:31.777
about that time, late 80's, early 90's.

150
00:06:31.777 --> 00:06:32.699
<v Voiceover>And movies either.</v>

151
00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:34.420
<v ->Yes, even movies, Phyllis Atwater</v>

152
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.840
comes to mind real quick in her books.

153
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.440
So I read everything I could

154
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.720
then I started integrating it slowly

155
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.200
almost like an algorithm like a computer scientist would.

156
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.820
Well, this fits here

157
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.780
slot A fits in slot B,

158
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.741
in tab C, you fold over before you can see D, you know.

159
00:06:52.741 --> 00:06:55.502
And so I started using the abilities that I have innately

160
00:06:55.502 --> 00:06:57.522
as someone who can think complexly

161
00:06:57.522 --> 00:06:59.954
and put very complex puzzles together.

162
00:07:01.123 --> 00:07:03.424
I used that knowledge to now come to

163
00:07:03.424 --> 00:07:06.435
relative conclusions about life, death, and rebirth.

164
00:07:07.745 --> 00:07:10.285
<v Voiceover>And you were talking a little bit ago</v>

165
00:07:10.285 --> 00:07:13.968
about the experience of seeing an actual body

166
00:07:13.968 --> 00:07:15.168
standing before you,

167
00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:17.068
now, you went further into that study

168
00:07:17.068 --> 00:07:20.728
and what did you discover about what that body you saw

169
00:07:20.728 --> 00:07:21.808
that day with your friends

170
00:07:21.808 --> 00:07:23.269
standing at the end of your bed,

171
00:07:23.269 --> 00:07:26.421
what conclusions have you come to us to what that is?

172
00:07:28.051 --> 00:07:31.011
<v ->The appearance of his skin as what</v>

173
00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:32.191
shocked me the most

174
00:07:32.191 --> 00:07:34.951
because he looked like an oriental ice sculpture,

175
00:07:34.951 --> 00:07:36.611
he had the clothing on

176
00:07:36.611 --> 00:07:39.511
but he was crystal clear in a sense.

177
00:07:39.511 --> 00:07:42.671
And I came to a statement

178
00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:45.271
from a shaman,

179
00:07:45.271 --> 00:07:48.792
Painted Arrow I believe is his name.

180
00:07:48.792 --> 00:07:53.463
He talks about how we come from a place of ice

181
00:07:54.393 --> 00:07:56.133
and I realized that he must have been talking

182
00:07:56.133 --> 00:07:58.896
about the vacuum of space, the zero point field in physics

183
00:07:58.896 --> 00:08:03.136
because in physics, we're both inside and outside the field

184
00:08:03.136 --> 00:08:04.376
all the time.

185
00:08:04.376 --> 00:08:06.176
We're kind of dead center in it.

186
00:08:06.176 --> 00:08:07.896
And the only thing that keeps us from feeling that

187
00:08:07.896 --> 00:08:11.616
absolute zero degrees is the biosphere.

188
00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:15.256
If for something were to happen to this earth's environment

189
00:08:15.256 --> 00:08:19.096
for example, a new Ice Age would be like a minimal

190
00:08:19.096 --> 00:08:21.216
example of what I'm talking about

191
00:08:21.216 --> 00:08:25.016
but for example, something very cataclysmic happened

192
00:08:25.016 --> 00:08:28.196
to this planet, say it tilted of its axis,

193
00:08:28.196 --> 00:08:30.276
you would change all the temperature and weather

194
00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:32.927
and everything.

195
00:08:32.927 --> 00:08:34.578
Many sections would have come inhabitable

196
00:08:34.578 --> 00:08:36.178
because it would turn to ice.

197
00:08:36.178 --> 00:08:37.598
Why does it turn to ice?

198
00:08:37.598 --> 00:08:41.282
It's because it loses a core solid radiation

199
00:08:41.282 --> 00:08:43.822
and it becomes really going into a Dark Age

200
00:08:43.822 --> 00:08:45.583
as we go in that sense.

201
00:08:45.583 --> 00:08:47.583
<v Voiceover>So what happens when the human crosses over</v>

202
00:08:47.583 --> 00:08:49.783
and leaves physical form?

203
00:08:49.783 --> 00:08:51.683
<v ->From what I can understand,</v>

204
00:08:51.683 --> 00:08:53.803
based on what I experienced

205
00:08:53.803 --> 00:08:56.183
and what I have been told by people who have died

206
00:08:56.183 --> 00:08:58.603
and had seen the light in their body

207
00:08:58.603 --> 00:09:00.443
transfer over into their new body,

208
00:09:00.443 --> 00:09:02.917
what we call the ethiric or spiritual body,

209
00:09:05.527 --> 00:09:06.907
DNA is immortal.

210
00:09:06.907 --> 00:09:09.247
DNA is a liquid crystal

211
00:09:09.247 --> 00:09:11.327
and it just crystallizes.

212
00:09:11.327 --> 00:09:14.287
When we die, it comes, the light and energy that we are,

213
00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:15.587
the consciousness that we are,

214
00:09:15.587 --> 00:09:17.467
the feelings that are,

215
00:09:17.467 --> 00:09:20.747
download into the next body and life goes on.

216
00:09:20.747 --> 00:09:23.907
<v Voiceover>So is it an essence carried forth into this,</v>

217
00:09:23.907 --> 00:09:28.108
for another term, higher self hyperspatial counterpart,

218
00:09:28.108 --> 00:09:31.008
whatever that we chose to call the part that continues,

219
00:09:31.008 --> 00:09:34.048
that where our essence that continues after physical form,

220
00:09:34.048 --> 00:09:35.768
this physical form has gone.

221
00:09:35.768 --> 00:09:39.568
That, you're saying, in a liquid crystalline form

222
00:09:39.568 --> 00:09:42.508
continues to carry the DNA imprint?

223
00:09:42.508 --> 00:09:43.428
<v ->Yes.</v>

224
00:09:43.428 --> 00:09:46.399
The DNA is very volatile as anyone that will

225
00:09:47.689 --> 00:09:48.929
share the research with you.

226
00:09:48.929 --> 00:09:52.029
It's extremely volatile substance, you might say,

227
00:09:52.029 --> 00:09:53.069
that changes dramatically

228
00:09:53.069 --> 00:09:55.489
but that's what gives us our aliveness

229
00:09:55.489 --> 00:09:58.699
the fact that as Doctor Bruce Lipton would say to us--

230
00:09:58.699 --> 00:10:00.071
<v Voiceover>Yes, we love him.</v>

231
00:10:00.071 --> 00:10:01.151
<v ->Yeah, we all do,</v>

232
00:10:01.151 --> 00:10:02.611
he's a teddy bear.

233
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:06.031
And what we could learn from Doctor Lipton's work

234
00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:08.371
is that we are the environment,

235
00:10:08.371 --> 00:10:09.431
right?

236
00:10:09.431 --> 00:10:12.491
Our skin is the extension of all our DNA cells

237
00:10:12.491 --> 00:10:14.451
just on the surface.

238
00:10:14.451 --> 00:10:17.572
These cell membrane were made of 50 trillion plus cells.

239
00:10:17.572 --> 00:10:20.972
Well, if you were to project that from the microscopic

240
00:10:20.972 --> 00:10:22.312
to the macroscopic,

241
00:10:22.312 --> 00:10:25.912
then our skin is the cell membrane

242
00:10:25.912 --> 00:10:28.872
of those 50 trillion cells

243
00:10:28.872 --> 00:10:30.952
so, we're here all the time.

244
00:10:30.952 --> 00:10:34.594
I mean, we're plugged in to the environment

245
00:10:34.594 --> 00:10:35.774
each and every second.

246
00:10:35.774 --> 00:10:37.434
And that's what we respond to,

247
00:10:37.434 --> 00:10:41.014
the energetic shifts, moods, thoughts

248
00:10:41.014 --> 00:10:42.254
that we picked up on

249
00:10:42.254 --> 00:10:44.736
has become more sensitive, all right?

250
00:10:44.736 --> 00:10:48.136
Mediums or insensitives are sensitive

251
00:10:48.136 --> 00:10:50.460
because they're reading that energy field

252
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.061
(mumbles).

253
00:10:52.061 --> 00:10:56.021
<v Voiceover>So would it be fair to say then</v>

254
00:10:56.021 --> 00:11:01.021
that this liquid crystalline DNA that is, in essence,

255
00:11:01.581 --> 00:11:04.301
captured and held within the essence

256
00:11:04.301 --> 00:11:08.421
might be part of that 95% junk DNA they keep talking about?

257
00:11:08.421 --> 00:11:09.721
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

258
00:11:09.721 --> 00:11:11.142
<v Voiceover>Can you comment on that a little a bit</v>

259
00:11:11.142 --> 00:11:13.203
because I just find it hysterical that we would

260
00:11:13.203 --> 00:11:16.363
had such a heinous error in our evolution

261
00:11:16.363 --> 00:11:19.283
that we have 95% junk DNA.

262
00:11:19.283 --> 00:11:20.823
<v ->The environment doesn't make mistakes,</v>

263
00:11:20.823 --> 00:11:22.743
it just responds to energetic shifts.

264
00:11:22.743 --> 00:11:25.883
So what that is all about as the junk DNA

265
00:11:25.883 --> 00:11:28.643
is no longer needed to make the fish in us,

266
00:11:28.643 --> 00:11:30.754
the fox in us, the bear in us.

267
00:11:31.804 --> 00:11:33.875
<v Voiceover>But what is it actually performing?</v>

268
00:11:34.665 --> 00:11:35.905
<v ->It is a memory.</v>

269
00:11:35.905 --> 00:11:39.245
It's a solid state crystalline memory

270
00:11:39.245 --> 00:11:41.945
of the entire evolutionary process on this planet

271
00:11:41.945 --> 00:11:43.785
since its inception.

272
00:11:43.785 --> 00:11:46.185
And all of that could be used again,

273
00:11:46.185 --> 00:11:48.765
should there be a crises of,

274
00:11:48.765 --> 00:11:52.065
I can't comprehend it but if it where to happen,

275
00:11:52.065 --> 00:11:54.545
our DNA will just begin again in a new form

276
00:11:54.545 --> 00:11:56.185
and try to raise consciousness

277
00:11:56.185 --> 00:12:00.025
as it has now with our body, our human body.

278
00:12:00.025 --> 00:12:04.125
<v Voiceover>And we are going through this transformation</v>

279
00:12:04.125 --> 00:12:05.425
as a species.

280
00:12:05.425 --> 00:12:07.785
It's appearing more and more people are lighting up.

281
00:12:07.785 --> 00:12:10.345
Wisdom is becoming a major commodity.

282
00:12:10.345 --> 00:12:13.365
Wired Magazine said, wisdom is the new commodity

283
00:12:13.365 --> 00:12:16.885
beyond materialism and cash starting now.

284
00:12:16.885 --> 00:12:18.225
<v ->Amen.</v>

285
00:12:18.225 --> 00:12:21.805
<v Voiceover>So what is driving this transformation</v>

286
00:12:21.805 --> 00:12:25.745
on an energetic level from what's your understanding?

287
00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.385
<v ->Physics would tell us today</v>

288
00:12:27.385 --> 00:12:29.225
that energy and matter

289
00:12:29.225 --> 00:12:32.525
actually are superseded by information.

290
00:12:32.525 --> 00:12:34.105
Mind, consciousness,

291
00:12:34.105 --> 00:12:39.105
information is what is the bedrock of material science.

292
00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:40.825
Information is the key

293
00:12:40.825 --> 00:12:44.665
'cause that is what lives forever, that is immortal.

294
00:12:44.665 --> 00:12:46.787
Well, you call it the mind of God,

295
00:12:46.787 --> 00:12:48.608
but it depends on which angle you wanna take.

296
00:12:48.608 --> 00:12:50.368
I'm comfortable with all these terms now.

297
00:12:50.368 --> 00:12:51.588
I don't see any difference

298
00:12:51.588 --> 00:12:54.968
between spirit in science, religion and science.

299
00:12:54.968 --> 00:12:56.628
They're all one truth

300
00:12:56.628 --> 00:12:58.528
but facing a different direction,

301
00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:00.701
they're two sides of the one coin.

302
00:13:02.831 --> 00:13:05.391
<v Voiceover>You also have had some insights as to</v>

303
00:13:05.391 --> 00:13:09.011
some of what might be coming up in the future,

304
00:13:09.011 --> 00:13:11.831
some of the possibilities for what we may be facing,

305
00:13:11.831 --> 00:13:15.271
it seems to me that humankind is also feeling this pressure

306
00:13:15.271 --> 00:13:18.129
that things are changing very rapidly,

307
00:13:18.129 --> 00:13:22.017
either as a sense of unease

308
00:13:22.017 --> 00:13:23.833
and that we don't know how this is all going to pan out.

309
00:13:23.833 --> 00:13:26.714
Do you feel comfortable sharing what kind of information

310
00:13:26.714 --> 00:13:28.874
you've gotten as to what our future might look like?

311
00:13:28.874 --> 00:13:31.454
And I'm going to tie this back in with DNA in a bit.

312
00:13:31.454 --> 00:13:34.074
And first of all,

313
00:13:34.074 --> 00:13:35.254
do you feel comfortable sharing it?

314
00:13:35.254 --> 00:13:38.334
And secondly, where did this come from,

315
00:13:38.334 --> 00:13:40.005
the information come from?

316
00:13:40.975 --> 00:13:42.615
<v ->I feel comfortable in the sense</v>

317
00:13:42.615 --> 00:13:45.615
that I believe what I'm telling you is the truth.

318
00:13:45.615 --> 00:13:49.716
But we all must reflect upon what that might mean

319
00:13:49.716 --> 00:13:53.636
for each individual where they might live geographically,

320
00:13:53.636 --> 00:13:57.496
might factor into their medium environment

321
00:13:57.496 --> 00:14:01.096
where they're living in clear and clean water and etcetera

322
00:14:01.096 --> 00:14:04.256
'cause I think this is tied into the the earth changes idea.

323
00:14:04.256 --> 00:14:06.759
The areas that are polluted the most have to be corrected,

324
00:14:06.759 --> 00:14:07.799
they will self-correct,

325
00:14:07.799 --> 00:14:09.379
they are self-corrected.

326
00:14:09.379 --> 00:14:12.679
The oceans were extremely toxic in places.

327
00:14:12.679 --> 00:14:16.359
The planet is extremely toxic in places.

328
00:14:16.359 --> 00:14:21.359
So those imbalances are part of what people are sensing,

329
00:14:21.699 --> 00:14:23.359
there is a need to change

330
00:14:23.359 --> 00:14:25.519
and we don't know exactly how to do it.

331
00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:28.959
A lot of these as problems are what Peter Russell

332
00:14:28.959 --> 00:14:31.659
would say are, soul sized problems.

333
00:14:31.659 --> 00:14:32.519
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

334
00:14:32.519 --> 00:14:33.399
<v ->Right?</v>

335
00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:34.880
And they are.

336
00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.760
Now, if the soul is,

337
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.040
might say say pattern information,

338
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.120
then we're sensing the entire planet Gaia

339
00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.300
as a living being that's in trouble and crying out.

340
00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.100
And we're trying to put those in,

341
00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.740
we're trying to English Gaia's mind.

342
00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.820
And so we stumble and we stutter

343
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.060
but we feel uneasy

344
00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.940
something's going to happen to self-correct the planet.

345
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.440
Part of that then

346
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.143
given that is the preface to what I'm gonna share,

347
00:15:07.143 --> 00:15:11.283
let's go forward into one vision that I had

348
00:15:11.283 --> 00:15:15.843
and it's very timely that I share it at this point.

349
00:15:15.843 --> 00:15:18.526
Mount Rainier, Washington which on a good day

350
00:15:18.526 --> 00:15:19.986
is right up that window--

351
00:15:19.986 --> 00:15:21.097
<v Voiceover>That's right.</v>

352
00:15:22.322 --> 00:15:24.602
<v ->And I, as a young boy as I was sharing with you,</v>

353
00:15:24.602 --> 00:15:27.102
used to travel up and down these roads here

354
00:15:27.102 --> 00:15:28.703
by lake Washington.

355
00:15:28.703 --> 00:15:31.043
And even up go fishing at Mount Rainier

356
00:15:31.043 --> 00:15:33.734
up in Carbonado and places like that.

357
00:15:36.024 --> 00:15:39.575
In June 1994,

358
00:15:40.485 --> 00:15:43.525
I was traveling in the Midwest to Kirksville, Missouri

359
00:15:43.525 --> 00:15:44.545
to interview for a job

360
00:15:44.545 --> 00:15:47.106
as a director of our counseling program.

361
00:15:47.106 --> 00:15:50.946
I just retired two years prior from the Navy

362
00:15:50.946 --> 00:15:54.166
which I was, my last job was not as an engineer,

363
00:15:54.166 --> 00:15:55.946
it was as a mental health counselor

364
00:15:55.946 --> 00:15:59.337
and program director of that type of activity.

365
00:16:00.347 --> 00:16:02.969
And I just done a years

366
00:16:02.969 --> 00:16:05.929
of vice principal of my old high school

367
00:16:05.929 --> 00:16:07.149
and I decided,

368
00:16:07.149 --> 00:16:09.009
well, I'm gonna go jump back in the mainstream

369
00:16:09.009 --> 00:16:10.589
I'm retired a little early now,

370
00:16:10.589 --> 00:16:12.210
I need to go back to work

371
00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:13.970
so I played as the vice principal of the high school

372
00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.372
until the kids ran me out.

373
00:16:16.372 --> 00:16:18.843
They were wonderful but it wasnâ€™t my calling.

374
00:16:20.153 --> 00:16:23.733
And so I was in Kirksville, Missouri with my wife, Connie.

375
00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:28.678
And we were at a days in in Kirksville, Missouri

376
00:16:28.678 --> 00:16:31.818
and at 4 AM again in the morning--

377
00:16:31.818 --> 00:16:33.938
<v Voiceover>It's a powerful time of the day.</v>

378
00:16:33.938 --> 00:16:36.239
<v ->The crack of dawn when the shaman would say</v>

379
00:16:36.239 --> 00:16:39.041
the world's part, you need to walk between them--

380
00:16:39.041 --> 00:16:40.642
<v Voiceover>That's right.</v>

381
00:16:40.642 --> 00:16:42.562
<v ->So, what happened to me</v>

382
00:16:42.562 --> 00:16:45.782
at 4 AM I had a panoramic three-dimensional

383
00:16:45.782 --> 00:16:49.673
full colored vision of Mount Rainier erupting.

384
00:16:50.783 --> 00:16:52.183
It was, I felt it,

385
00:16:52.183 --> 00:16:53.623
I sensed it,

386
00:16:53.623 --> 00:16:56.623
I was startled by it

387
00:16:56.623 --> 00:16:58.823
and I obviously couldn't go back to sleep

388
00:16:58.823 --> 00:17:01.723
after I had that vision.

389
00:17:01.723 --> 00:17:05.043
So any way, I declined the job

390
00:17:05.043 --> 00:17:07.859
offered in Kirksville at the medical clinic,

391
00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:11.539
came back home to Silverdale, Washington

392
00:17:11.539 --> 00:17:15.180
which is across a Puget Sound from Seattle

393
00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.791
and I told my wife we're moving.

394
00:17:18.721 --> 00:17:19.992
I think,

395
00:17:20.982 --> 00:17:23.582
it might have been a little erratic behavior in my part

396
00:17:23.582 --> 00:17:27.442
but I said, if that mountain is gonna blow

397
00:17:27.442 --> 00:17:30.082
as I saw it do,

398
00:17:30.082 --> 00:17:31.522
I also sense that it would be

399
00:17:31.522 --> 00:17:33.322
because of a massive earthquake

400
00:17:33.322 --> 00:17:35.182
that struck this region

401
00:17:35.182 --> 00:17:37.942
of the Coast of Washington and Oregon

402
00:17:37.942 --> 00:17:39.282
that a tsunami,

403
00:17:39.282 --> 00:17:41.422
a tremendous tsunami would be generated

404
00:17:41.422 --> 00:17:43.262
and that earthquake would be in

405
00:17:43.262 --> 00:17:46.582
a 8.5, to 9.0 range.

406
00:17:46.582 --> 00:17:50.602
These types of information are hard to

407
00:17:50.602 --> 00:17:53.142
put into words because there's so many variables

408
00:17:53.142 --> 00:17:56.182
so I don't want anyone to change their residence

409
00:17:56.182 --> 00:18:00.642
because John Jay Harper shared something, okay?

410
00:18:00.642 --> 00:18:02.002
However, do I believe it's true?

411
00:18:02.002 --> 00:18:02.702
Yes.

412
00:18:02.702 --> 00:18:04.642
Do I think it will manifest pretty soon?

413
00:18:04.642 --> 00:18:07.342
Yes, I do.

414
00:18:07.342 --> 00:18:09.762
I've talked with others who have had the same vision,

415
00:18:09.762 --> 00:18:13.153
who I trust and respect for not being sensationalist.

416
00:18:16.033 --> 00:18:17.004
<v Voiceover>So what are you looking at</v>

417
00:18:17.004 --> 00:18:20.224
as the underlying cause of this when you say

418
00:18:20.224 --> 00:18:22.044
this is all linked to consciousness

419
00:18:22.044 --> 00:18:25.144
and the earth itself trying to go through its corrections,

420
00:18:25.144 --> 00:18:29.215
what would this event be inspired by or relating to?

421
00:18:30.125 --> 00:18:32.205
<v ->What I've decided and have confirmed</v>

422
00:18:32.205 --> 00:18:34.285
through ancient texts and scripture

423
00:18:34.285 --> 00:18:37.748
and different things especially in the Vedic traditions.

424
00:18:37.748 --> 00:18:42.248
The ancient saw this planet as a spec in space

425
00:18:42.248 --> 00:18:45.808
in a solar system that was a spec in space

426
00:18:45.808 --> 00:18:49.528
that was connected top the center of the milky way galaxy

427
00:18:49.528 --> 00:18:53.368
very much the way John Major Jenkins sees it.

428
00:18:53.368 --> 00:18:54.868
<v Voiceover>And in fact,</v>

429
00:18:54.868 --> 00:18:56.888
we've also spoken to him about that.

430
00:18:56.888 --> 00:18:57.648
<v ->Very good.</v>

431
00:18:57.648 --> 00:18:59.948
He wrote the one of the appendices in my book.

432
00:18:59.948 --> 00:19:01.190
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

433
00:19:02.048 --> 00:19:03.511
<v ->I think on how to connect it directly</v>

434
00:19:03.511 --> 00:19:05.631
to our discussion today

435
00:19:05.631 --> 00:19:09.991
is to say that magnetism itself,

436
00:19:09.991 --> 00:19:13.531
the largest source of magnetism as the ancients claimed

437
00:19:13.531 --> 00:19:16.091
is in what we would call that black hole

438
00:19:16.091 --> 00:19:18.731
at the center of the milky way galaxy.

439
00:19:18.731 --> 00:19:21.073
Now, I've even had some near death experiencers

440
00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:23.393
share with me that they traveled through

441
00:19:23.393 --> 00:19:26.133
that black hole and beyond.

442
00:19:26.133 --> 00:19:28.533
Others, to get to one point

443
00:19:28.533 --> 00:19:31.433
of your earlier question about pyramids

444
00:19:31.433 --> 00:19:34.813
specially the three pyramids at Giza

445
00:19:34.813 --> 00:19:38.813
that Robert Bauval, Graham Hancock and others,

446
00:19:38.813 --> 00:19:41.413
Adrian Gilbert would be another one that comes to mind,

447
00:19:41.413 --> 00:19:45.753
have confirmed to relative satisfaction.

448
00:19:45.753 --> 00:19:48.153
They talked about the Orion constellation

449
00:19:48.153 --> 00:19:51.653
as being important to our future.

450
00:19:51.653 --> 00:19:55.513
I have uncovered, rediscovered

451
00:19:55.513 --> 00:19:58.313
from my own studies and talking with people

452
00:19:58.313 --> 00:19:59.953
who had near death experiences,

453
00:19:59.953 --> 00:20:04.553
some of them actually went to the Orion constellation

454
00:20:04.553 --> 00:20:07.073
and had their spiritual experiences

455
00:20:07.073 --> 00:20:10.653
with such figures as Mother Mary,

456
00:20:10.653 --> 00:20:12.373
as Jesus.

457
00:20:12.373 --> 00:20:15.573
They were not told that these were those figures

458
00:20:15.573 --> 00:20:18.113
but they, when they came back they said,

459
00:20:18.113 --> 00:20:21.393
from our religious icons and images and teachings,

460
00:20:21.393 --> 00:20:25.073
that's who they would relate to the best, okay?

461
00:20:25.073 --> 00:20:26.933
To be clear about that.

462
00:20:26.933 --> 00:20:28.513
This is not a religious message.

463
00:20:28.513 --> 00:20:29.493
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

464
00:20:29.493 --> 00:20:30.333
<v ->Okay.</v>

465
00:20:30.333 --> 00:20:32.224
It's a science's soul message.

466
00:20:33.854 --> 00:20:35.294
<v Voiceover>So time, yes,</v>

467
00:20:35.294 --> 00:20:37.274
go ahead, continue, yes.

468
00:20:37.274 --> 00:20:39.054
<v ->What they shared with me,</v>

469
00:20:39.054 --> 00:20:41.174
on several occasions and from several sources

470
00:20:41.174 --> 00:20:43.334
and this is why it's important to me,

471
00:20:43.334 --> 00:20:45.194
the sources keep coming up now

472
00:20:45.194 --> 00:20:46.276
in the last two or three years,

473
00:20:46.276 --> 00:20:47.737
just more and more, some of them call me,

474
00:20:47.737 --> 00:20:48.957
email me,

475
00:20:48.957 --> 00:20:50.937
somehow, I get a hold on me and say

476
00:20:50.937 --> 00:20:52.337
that's the same thing you've said

477
00:20:52.337 --> 00:20:53.897
on such and such of program many years ago,

478
00:20:53.897 --> 00:20:55.017
eight years ago, 10 years ago.

479
00:20:55.017 --> 00:20:58.537
I've been talking about this now since 1994

480
00:20:58.537 --> 00:21:02.617
actually on radio to a free television spots.

481
00:21:04.047 --> 00:21:05.897
The Orion constellation evidently

482
00:21:05.897 --> 00:21:07.817
from what I can determine

483
00:21:07.817 --> 00:21:10.297
has our future,

484
00:21:10.297 --> 00:21:12.437
or how do you say this,

485
00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:16.757
it has our body double living there now.

486
00:21:16.757 --> 00:21:18.977
And that when we talk about our higher self,

487
00:21:18.977 --> 00:21:22.017
we're interfacing our DNA from this body

488
00:21:22.017 --> 00:21:24.277
into that another light body,

489
00:21:24.277 --> 00:21:26.117
but that light body is really resonant

490
00:21:26.117 --> 00:21:27.937
in the Orion constellation.

491
00:21:27.937 --> 00:21:29.917
And this is why the Egyptians,

492
00:21:29.917 --> 00:21:31.137
and the Mayans,

493
00:21:31.137 --> 00:21:34.437
and all the ancient civilizations paints.

494
00:21:34.437 --> 00:21:35.298
<v Voiceover>They're oriented,</v>

495
00:21:35.298 --> 00:21:37.608
their observatories, everything toward the Orion, yes.

496
00:21:37.608 --> 00:21:39.428
<v ->Exactly, it's purposeful behavior.</v>

497
00:21:39.428 --> 00:21:42.609
It's plain as anything once you break the codes down

498
00:21:42.609 --> 00:21:46.769
and look at it objectively without any agenda.

499
00:21:46.769 --> 00:21:47.969
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

500
00:21:47.969 --> 00:21:51.729
We could go so many directions at this moment.

501
00:21:51.729 --> 00:21:55.729
I would like to tie this now back in.

502
00:21:55.729 --> 00:21:57.709
So you have Rainier,

503
00:21:57.709 --> 00:21:59.921
you have our DNA.

504
00:22:01.291 --> 00:22:02.092
Okay.

505
00:22:02.092 --> 00:22:02.892
<v ->Yes.</v>

506
00:22:02.892 --> 00:22:06.932
<v Voiceover>And our DNA, our collective DNA consciousness</v>

507
00:22:06.932 --> 00:22:11.472
is affecting the severity, potential severity

508
00:22:11.472 --> 00:22:13.452
of the various events that may be occurring

509
00:22:13.452 --> 00:22:15.852
in the future as well from what I'm understanding.

510
00:22:15.852 --> 00:22:17.172
<v ->Correct.</v>

511
00:22:17.172 --> 00:22:18.832
And let me make two points.

512
00:22:18.832 --> 00:22:21.932
One, the reason I think I have that particular

513
00:22:21.932 --> 00:22:24.912
Mount Rainier vision of catastrophe

514
00:22:24.912 --> 00:22:28.432
is because this may sound strange but I believe it,

515
00:22:28.432 --> 00:22:31.892
I grew up at the base of that mountain.

516
00:22:31.892 --> 00:22:35.272
My parents and I, and my two brothers and sisters

517
00:22:35.272 --> 00:22:37.292
used to plant a huge vegetable garden

518
00:22:37.292 --> 00:22:39.373
in that mountain ash.

519
00:22:39.373 --> 00:22:43.173
We used to plant all of our crops every spring.

520
00:22:43.173 --> 00:22:46.953
We ate that food that came from that land,

521
00:22:46.953 --> 00:22:51.873
year after year as a child, I believe that that literally

522
00:22:51.873 --> 00:22:54.174
attuned me to that mountain.

523
00:22:54.174 --> 00:22:55.674
<v Voiceover>Yes, that makes total sense.</v>

524
00:22:55.674 --> 00:22:57.314
<v ->And I was born here.</v>

525
00:22:57.314 --> 00:23:00.325
I was born right here in Seattle at Providence Hospital.

526
00:23:01.835 --> 00:23:03.175
<v Voiceover>So how does,</v>

527
00:23:04.515 --> 00:23:06.755
through the food chain, through your parents,

528
00:23:06.755 --> 00:23:08.995
through this kind of very earthly type of

529
00:23:08.995 --> 00:23:10.715
influence on your body structure

530
00:23:10.715 --> 00:23:12.015
and your development as well

531
00:23:12.015 --> 00:23:13.615
that tied you into being able

532
00:23:13.615 --> 00:23:16.336
to in essence, magnetize to that information?

533
00:23:16.336 --> 00:23:17.896
<v ->Yes, to resonate with it.</v>

534
00:23:17.896 --> 00:23:20.276
Be a resonate or attuned through it,

535
00:23:20.276 --> 00:23:22.657
through magnetic field, yes.

536
00:23:22.657 --> 00:23:24.798
<v Voiceover>So how does our,</v>

537
00:23:24.798 --> 00:23:26.598
I've read that you discussed this,

538
00:23:26.598 --> 00:23:30.898
how does our collective DNA

539
00:23:30.898 --> 00:23:32.918
potentially affect the severity

540
00:23:32.918 --> 00:23:34.638
of some of the up coming earth change?

541
00:23:34.638 --> 00:23:36.438
And if you care to comment on any of the others

542
00:23:36.438 --> 00:23:38.978
you've seen as well, that would be fine as well.

543
00:23:38.978 --> 00:23:40.358
<v ->Okay.</v>

544
00:23:40.358 --> 00:23:43.358
If we understand that DNA is immortal,

545
00:23:43.358 --> 00:23:45.160
another word, it's a liquid crystal

546
00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.718
that cannot be destroyed.

547
00:23:47.718 --> 00:23:49.460
It can be damaged but it can heal itself.

548
00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.700
It's self-healing, self-replicating, okay?

549
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.580
So if we realize that the air that we breath,

550
00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.840
the water that we drink,

551
00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.391
food that we eat

552
00:24:00.781 --> 00:24:04.261
are all DNA related elements.

553
00:24:04.261 --> 00:24:07.401
Everything alive is made from one DNA molecule.

554
00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:08.941
There's 20 amino acids,

555
00:24:08.941 --> 00:24:12.581
three configuration of those 20 amino acids

556
00:24:12.581 --> 00:24:14.221
is what builds the proteins

557
00:24:14.221 --> 00:24:16.761
that structures of the physical body as Doctor Lipton

558
00:24:16.761 --> 00:24:20.125
does an excellent job of summarizing for us.

559
00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:22.245
And if we realize that the environment

560
00:24:22.245 --> 00:24:25.226
is no further away than our fingertips,

561
00:24:25.226 --> 00:24:26.926
on the surface of our skin

562
00:24:26.926 --> 00:24:30.626
and we're sitting in a huge electromagnetic field of energy

563
00:24:30.626 --> 00:24:32.826
that is also resonating with the energy

564
00:24:32.826 --> 00:24:34.646
at the core of the earth

565
00:24:34.646 --> 00:24:36.746
and to the outer extremes of the atmosphere

566
00:24:36.746 --> 00:24:38.106
and beyond,

567
00:24:38.106 --> 00:24:40.446
resonant with the sun, other planets

568
00:24:40.446 --> 00:24:44.066
and you have astrology that talk about that relationship.

569
00:24:44.066 --> 00:24:46.667
All of its link to the center alignment

570
00:24:46.667 --> 00:24:50.907
of the milky way galaxy with the sun and our planets,

571
00:24:50.907 --> 00:24:55.407
and our earth on or about 2012.

572
00:24:55.407 --> 00:24:58.687
That's a mathematical fact.

573
00:24:58.687 --> 00:25:00.667
<v Voiceover>So what it your perception of 2012?</v>

574
00:25:00.667 --> 00:25:01.728
we've talked to Bruce James

575
00:25:01.728 --> 00:25:03.812
and we talked to Walter Cruttenden, The Great Year.

576
00:25:03.812 --> 00:25:04.872
<v ->Walter's in my book,</v>

577
00:25:04.872 --> 00:25:07.091
I got that quote from him.

578
00:25:07.091 --> 00:25:09.111
<v Voiceover>And what is your take on it</v>

579
00:25:09.111 --> 00:25:13.271
from a shamanic transformational perspective?

580
00:25:13.271 --> 00:25:15.648
<v ->I think what we're seeing is something like</v>

581
00:25:15.648 --> 00:25:19.015
Deshardane, the priest Tahao Deshardane

582
00:25:19.015 --> 00:25:20.973
wrote about the new sphere,

583
00:25:20.973 --> 00:25:24.492
the tightening, ever tightening link of each other

584
00:25:24.492 --> 00:25:26.830
in consciousness in the economy

585
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:29.971
together into one global civilization.

586
00:25:29.971 --> 00:25:32.191
That's almost a bad word because

587
00:25:32.191 --> 00:25:34.068
people link it with new world order.

588
00:25:34.068 --> 00:25:36.687
Well, there is going to be a new world order

589
00:25:36.687 --> 00:25:39.947
but it may no be anything like others have written about.

590
00:25:39.947 --> 00:25:43.047
It's going to be one of increasing sensitivity

591
00:25:43.047 --> 00:25:46.046
to each other to the environment,

592
00:25:46.046 --> 00:25:48.287
animals, plants,

593
00:25:48.287 --> 00:25:49.547
that type of thing.

594
00:25:49.547 --> 00:25:53.267
It's going to be so intense of an experience

595
00:25:53.267 --> 00:25:56.146
with the environment that if we try to harm each other

596
00:25:56.146 --> 00:25:58.427
or a plant, or an animal

597
00:25:58.427 --> 00:26:01.027
we will feel it immediately.

598
00:26:01.027 --> 00:26:04.446
That's the type of telepathic feeling sense

599
00:26:04.446 --> 00:26:07.166
that we are heading to in my opinion.

600
00:26:07.166 --> 00:26:09.046
<v Voiceover>So do you think that the center</v>

601
00:26:09.046 --> 00:26:13.853
of the milky way event centered around 2012

602
00:26:15.226 --> 00:26:18.444
is also having to do with the increase

603
00:26:18.444 --> 00:26:21.184
in the changes in the earth's activity?

604
00:26:21.184 --> 00:26:24.543
<v ->Yes, what we're saying is a resonant length</v>

605
00:26:24.543 --> 00:26:26.924
like two magnets beings held together,

606
00:26:26.924 --> 00:26:28.524
very powerful magnets.

607
00:26:28.524 --> 00:26:30.744
So you got the earth here, the sun

608
00:26:30.744 --> 00:26:31.864
and then you've got the milky way

609
00:26:31.864 --> 00:26:33.660
maybe in the background here

610
00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.200
and this alignment process is taking place

611
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.700
because we're getting in direct alignment

612
00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.721
with the center core of the milky way.

613
00:26:41.721 --> 00:26:44.700
And so, that is like any small magnet

614
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.101
would respond to a huge magnet.

615
00:26:47.101 --> 00:26:49.060
The earth is changing,

616
00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:52.801
the shift of the ages is about a magnetic pull shift

617
00:26:52.801 --> 00:26:56.547
towards a more perfected alignment

618
00:26:56.547 --> 00:26:58.606
with the core of the milky way

619
00:26:58.606 --> 00:27:00.387
that brings good and bad.

620
00:27:00.387 --> 00:27:02.426
If you're sitting on a mountain that's gonna detonate,

621
00:27:02.426 --> 00:27:03.586
that's bad.

622
00:27:03.586 --> 00:27:05.746
But if you're waiting for the weather to get better,

623
00:27:05.746 --> 00:27:07.546
it's going to.

624
00:27:07.546 --> 00:27:09.726
Right now, we're in the down side

625
00:27:09.726 --> 00:27:12.006
but eventually, another decade or so,

626
00:27:12.006 --> 00:27:13.886
15 years, 20 years from now,

627
00:27:13.886 --> 00:27:15.767
we'll come out of this.

628
00:27:15.767 --> 00:27:18.366
But the severity that you preferred to

629
00:27:18.366 --> 00:27:21.266
is very, very much on my mind.

630
00:27:21.266 --> 00:27:23.686
Because if we keep doing the same old thing

631
00:27:23.686 --> 00:27:25.906
and think we're gonna get a different result,

632
00:27:25.906 --> 00:27:27.423
that's the definition of mental illness

633
00:27:27.423 --> 00:27:29.663
from where I come from.

634
00:27:30.833 --> 00:27:32.124
<v Voiceover>It surely is.</v>

635
00:27:32.124 --> 00:27:36.144
So this is really getting into care for our host,

636
00:27:36.144 --> 00:27:37.365
care for the earth.

637
00:27:37.365 --> 00:27:38.005
<v ->Yes.</v>

638
00:27:38.005 --> 00:27:38.845
<v Voiceover>Really?</v>

639
00:27:38.845 --> 00:27:41.725
Are you seeing that at the core of what has to be

640
00:27:41.725 --> 00:27:44.785
a priority, a number one priority perhaps at this time?

641
00:27:44.785 --> 00:27:45.945
<v ->Environment is number one,</v>

642
00:27:45.945 --> 00:27:47.745
Gaia is number one.

643
00:27:47.745 --> 00:27:49.445
If we don't respect our mothers,

644
00:27:49.445 --> 00:27:51.145
she's not gonna respect us.

645
00:27:51.145 --> 00:27:52.405
She doesn't really need us,

646
00:27:52.405 --> 00:27:54.265
she can grow a new form

647
00:27:54.265 --> 00:27:56.465
and represent her consciousness through another

648
00:27:56.465 --> 00:27:58.836
three dimensional image than the human.

649
00:28:00.426 --> 00:28:02.606
<v Voiceover>So what other kinds of information?</v>

650
00:28:02.606 --> 00:28:06.786
I know you're certainly well connected within this field.

651
00:28:06.786 --> 00:28:10.066
What other kind of information are you getting regarding

652
00:28:10.066 --> 00:28:14.038
maybe perhaps extending into the human realm of

653
00:28:14.906 --> 00:28:17.888
how this consciousness is going to be able surface through

654
00:28:17.888 --> 00:28:20.248
some of the darker

655
00:28:20.248 --> 00:28:22.468
types of consciousness that are existing right now

656
00:28:22.468 --> 00:28:25.149
that are more centered in greed and fear?

657
00:28:25.149 --> 00:28:27.229
How do you see that shift?

658
00:28:27.229 --> 00:28:28.949
<v ->It's gonna be painful for them.</v>

659
00:28:28.949 --> 00:28:30.249
Very painful.

660
00:28:30.249 --> 00:28:33.489
Because if you and I for example come across,

661
00:28:33.489 --> 00:28:37.370
let say an impasse of a block that that's strong,

662
00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:38.611
in my opinion, I know what I would do.

663
00:28:38.611 --> 00:28:39.731
I would turn around

664
00:28:39.731 --> 00:28:41.571
and just slowly walk away from it.

665
00:28:41.571 --> 00:28:43.251
I mean in other words, someone tells me,

666
00:28:43.251 --> 00:28:45.953
"John, I will take away all your money away from you."

667
00:28:45.953 --> 00:28:48.593
Well, that's gonna hurt but that's okay.

668
00:28:48.593 --> 00:28:51.313
"John, I'm gonna do this or that against you, whatever."

669
00:28:51.313 --> 00:28:53.833
Unless it's something physical against me and my family,

670
00:28:53.833 --> 00:28:55.493
I've got three kids, and eight grandchildren

671
00:28:55.493 --> 00:28:57.433
so I'm pretty protective papa.

672
00:28:57.433 --> 00:29:00.253
But other than, that talk a severe situation,

673
00:29:00.253 --> 00:29:03.213
it doesn't matter, my home, my things, you know,

674
00:29:03.213 --> 00:29:05.373
that's what gonna shift around I believe

675
00:29:05.373 --> 00:29:07.213
because when the economy's changed

676
00:29:07.213 --> 00:29:08.953
and if you're not willing to change with the economy,

677
00:29:08.953 --> 00:29:10.753
your source of income might go away

678
00:29:10.753 --> 00:29:13.383
which means your taxes are no longer being

679
00:29:13.383 --> 00:29:16.913
paid into the US treasury in our country, for example.

680
00:29:16.913 --> 00:29:18.513
And therefore there's less resource.

681
00:29:18.513 --> 00:29:21.275
Less resource, they have to budget cut

682
00:29:21.275 --> 00:29:24.015
and find how to spend the money they do have.

683
00:29:24.015 --> 00:29:26.377
And so social security

684
00:29:26.377 --> 00:29:30.077
and other school or medical or secondary things,

685
00:29:30.077 --> 00:29:31.668
taking care with the elderly,

686
00:29:31.668 --> 00:29:34.138
Maybe that will become less of our priority.

687
00:29:34.138 --> 00:29:35.418
I'm not saying that it will,

688
00:29:35.418 --> 00:29:37.501
I'm just saying, if you got X dollar

689
00:29:37.501 --> 00:29:39.180
and you got Y problems,

690
00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.164
something's got to give.

691
00:29:40.164 --> 00:29:42.004
if you're gonna balance budget, right?

692
00:29:42.004 --> 00:29:43.494
Just like in our home budget.

693
00:29:43.494 --> 00:29:45.514
So that is a big change.

694
00:29:45.514 --> 00:29:47.894
I think it's economic where resources go.

695
00:29:47.894 --> 00:29:51.974
And for example , if I may go on for one second here,

696
00:29:51.974 --> 00:29:56.234
when I look at my, say, that medicine cabinet in my home

697
00:29:56.234 --> 00:29:58.194
or underneath my sink,

698
00:29:58.194 --> 00:30:00.694
or in my two car garage,

699
00:30:00.694 --> 00:30:03.614
and I still look at toxic chemicals

700
00:30:03.614 --> 00:30:05.874
stack like I'm preparing for a war

701
00:30:05.874 --> 00:30:08.601
with a third world country that's unarmed,

702
00:30:09.811 --> 00:30:11.231
I get some guilt

703
00:30:11.231 --> 00:30:12.931
because I'm still part of the problem

704
00:30:12.931 --> 00:30:14.357
and not part of the solution.

705
00:30:14.357 --> 00:30:18.057
And for years, I've been trying to be part of the solution.

706
00:30:18.057 --> 00:30:22.137
So I realized how difficult,

707
00:30:22.137 --> 00:30:25.808
what I'm saying here is to digest and apply.

708
00:30:27.798 --> 00:30:29.858
<v Voiceover>Then in another level,</v>

709
00:30:29.858 --> 00:30:31.238
resources never die.

710
00:30:31.238 --> 00:30:33.138
they just change hands.

711
00:30:33.138 --> 00:30:35.338
<v ->Up to a point.</v>

712
00:30:35.338 --> 00:30:37.338
<v Voiceover>Then what?</v>

713
00:30:37.338 --> 00:30:39.279
<v ->Where we're going a long term</v>

714
00:30:39.279 --> 00:30:42.239
is we will become very telepathic.

715
00:30:42.239 --> 00:30:43.719
Okay, what does that mean?

716
00:30:43.719 --> 00:30:46.119
It means you can't lie to me and I can't lie to you.

717
00:30:46.119 --> 00:30:47.859
Number one, you'll know

718
00:30:47.859 --> 00:30:50.042
who I am through the sermon anyway, I think.

719
00:30:50.042 --> 00:30:53.662
But really, when you hear my thoughts in you head

720
00:30:53.662 --> 00:30:55.504
and after disturbing thoughts,

721
00:30:55.504 --> 00:30:58.105
you remove your self from my presence, right?

722
00:30:58.105 --> 00:30:59.345
Okay.

723
00:30:59.345 --> 00:31:04.025
Number two, we're going to see a tremendous change in

724
00:31:04.025 --> 00:31:07.665
the way we look at our lives in terms of creativity.

725
00:31:07.665 --> 00:31:12.645
We are here to be the solution

726
00:31:12.645 --> 00:31:14.785
to the problems we've already created

727
00:31:14.785 --> 00:31:17.825
and then go beyond that to live in

728
00:31:17.825 --> 00:31:20.025
what I call a restored Garden of Eden.

729
00:31:20.025 --> 00:31:22.325
That's the long term vision that I have

730
00:31:22.325 --> 00:31:24.506
and that's been shared with me

731
00:31:24.506 --> 00:31:26.406
by many near death experiencers,

732
00:31:26.406 --> 00:31:28.406
and I believe of their visions.

733
00:31:28.406 --> 00:31:31.246
I can go back in the ancient scriptures like the Vedas.

734
00:31:31.246 --> 00:31:33.022
In my book I quote a section there

735
00:31:33.022 --> 00:31:36.403
that talks about when man could fly through the air,

736
00:31:36.403 --> 00:31:39.582
when plants and animals lived in harmony,

737
00:31:39.582 --> 00:31:42.542
when the water was crystalline clear,

738
00:31:42.542 --> 00:31:45.563
when everything came out of the ground spontaneously

739
00:31:45.563 --> 00:31:47.882
that we needed in terms of vegetables.

740
00:31:47.882 --> 00:31:49.480
Everyone was a vegetarian

741
00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.620
during those golden ages, no doubt about it,

742
00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.701
I'm not a vegetarian

743
00:31:53.701 --> 00:31:56.280
but I know that that's where I'm gonna have to go

744
00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.691
maybe next lifetime.

745
00:31:57.691 --> 00:32:02.251
But you know, in a nutshell,

746
00:32:02.251 --> 00:32:04.692
without getting in too much depth there,

747
00:32:04.692 --> 00:32:06.691
that's the overview that I see.

748
00:32:06.691 --> 00:32:08.772
<v Voiceover>So you're seeing passing through</v>

749
00:32:08.772 --> 00:32:10.708
some challenging times

750
00:32:10.708 --> 00:32:13.809
and this is not just for Mount Rainier but globally.

751
00:32:13.809 --> 00:32:15.202
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

752
00:32:15.202 --> 00:32:20.202
It's a global earth-based shift of energy,

753
00:32:20.223 --> 00:32:22.182
resources, consciousness,

754
00:32:22.182 --> 00:32:24.342
information exchange, everything.

755
00:32:24.342 --> 00:32:25.742
And like you said before,

756
00:32:25.742 --> 00:32:27.999
a quote from Wired Magazine, wisdom.

757
00:32:27.999 --> 00:32:32.206
Yes, wisdom is going to be the commodity most in--

758
00:32:33.516 --> 00:32:34.848
<v Voiceover>Demand, so it's a needed most?</v>

759
00:32:34.848 --> 00:32:35.748
<v ->Yeah, it's just--</v>

760
00:32:35.748 --> 00:32:36.344
<v Voiceover>Top priority?</v>

761
00:32:36.344 --> 00:32:37.911
<v ->Yes, top, top of the list.</v>

762
00:32:39.162 --> 00:32:40.902
<v Voiceover>Okay, now</v>

763
00:32:40.902 --> 00:32:43.161
the subject of DNA, I've kind of,

764
00:32:43.161 --> 00:32:46.001
because it's coming up in so many different ways,

765
00:32:46.001 --> 00:32:47.941
I wanted to know if you have any information

766
00:32:47.941 --> 00:32:50.841
as to how the ancients may have depicted

767
00:32:50.841 --> 00:32:53.061
or understood our DNA,

768
00:32:53.061 --> 00:32:55.882
and our DNA in linking with other constellations,

769
00:32:55.882 --> 00:32:58.221
the cosmos etcetera because

770
00:32:58.221 --> 00:32:59.902
in some of the hieroglyphs it's said that

771
00:32:59.902 --> 00:33:01.299
some of those little squiggles we see and such

772
00:33:01.299 --> 00:33:02.878
are actually DNA.

773
00:33:02.878 --> 00:33:03.658
<v ->Yes, they are.</v>

774
00:33:03.658 --> 00:33:04.399
I believe they are.

775
00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:05.499
<v Voiceover>So can you talk about some of that</v>

776
00:33:05.499 --> 00:33:08.918
in perhaps even through Egyptology or--

777
00:33:08.918 --> 00:33:11.406
<v ->Well, DNA has been,</v>

778
00:33:12.475 --> 00:33:16.375
I believe the most understudied and misunderstood

779
00:33:16.375 --> 00:33:18.415
when it was studied

780
00:33:18.415 --> 00:33:20.919
discipline in science.

781
00:33:20.919 --> 00:33:22.719
We're headed towards nanotechnology

782
00:33:22.719 --> 00:33:26.580
and interphase of DNA with biochips etcetera.

783
00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.800
That's an interesting thing to do but if

784
00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.040
you're only playing with fire,

785
00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.740
you don't know what you're

786
00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:34.140
getting yourself into,

787
00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.181
you could create as that

788
00:33:35.181 --> 00:33:36.780
one neardeath experiencer told me,

789
00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:38.340
Milton Thomas Benedict, he said,

790
00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:39.987
we're about already to create

791
00:33:39.987 --> 00:33:42.947
the next Tower of Babel

792
00:33:42.947 --> 00:33:44.768
then don't know it.

793
00:33:44.768 --> 00:33:47.439
You can go so far and then

794
00:33:47.439 --> 00:33:50.380
nature through DNA self-corrects

795
00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.769
and the whiplash may not be what

796
00:33:52.769 --> 00:33:54.576
you wanna experience.

797
00:33:54.576 --> 00:33:58.976
For example, a bad cow disease, bird flu.

798
00:33:58.976 --> 00:34:02.516
Now, on the surface they seem disconnected

799
00:34:02.516 --> 00:34:05.636
but not if you realize that DNA is in every air molecule,

800
00:34:05.636 --> 00:34:07.336
every water molecule

801
00:34:07.336 --> 00:34:09.476
connected them to a huge field of energy

802
00:34:09.476 --> 00:34:12.594
and matter and information that is the biosphere itself.

803
00:34:12.594 --> 00:34:14.495
In other words, this entire,

804
00:34:14.495 --> 00:34:17.405
everything that we see around us here is DNA

805
00:34:17.405 --> 00:34:19.376
inside and out.

806
00:34:19.376 --> 00:34:21.396
We're seeing through the eyes of DNA.

807
00:34:21.396 --> 00:34:25.586
I'm speaking to you with the voice of DNA.

808
00:34:26.696 --> 00:34:29.696
Jeremy Narby, Doctor Jeremy Narby, an anthropologist

809
00:34:29.696 --> 00:34:32.117
at Stanford University, where he got his PhD.

810
00:34:32.117 --> 00:34:34.498
and then I believe he moved to Switzerland.

811
00:34:34.498 --> 00:34:36.578
He wrote a book called the Cosmic Serpent,

812
00:34:36.578 --> 00:34:39.418
DNA and The Origins of Knowledge.

813
00:34:39.418 --> 00:34:40.518
And to answer your question,

814
00:34:40.518 --> 00:34:42.958
this would be the best way I could share

815
00:34:42.958 --> 00:34:46.659
is through his research and conclusions.

816
00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:49.999
Jeremy Narby went to the Amazon,

817
00:34:49.999 --> 00:34:51.559
lived for a couple of years.

818
00:34:51.559 --> 00:34:54.379
This was probably 15 or 20 years ago

819
00:34:54.379 --> 00:34:56.939
while he was getting his PhD at Stanford University,

820
00:34:56.939 --> 00:34:59.359
in Palo Alto, California.

821
00:34:59.359 --> 00:35:01.579
When he went to live with the shamans,

822
00:35:01.579 --> 00:35:03.639
he was given the opportunity

823
00:35:03.639 --> 00:35:07.739
to take part in the Ayahuasca ceremonies

824
00:35:07.739 --> 00:35:09.699
known as the vine of the soul

825
00:35:09.699 --> 00:35:13.419
or the rope to the milky way,

826
00:35:13.419 --> 00:35:17.679
there's just a myriad number of ways to describe

827
00:35:17.679 --> 00:35:19.419
the Ayahuasca experience.

828
00:35:19.419 --> 00:35:21.399
But in short,

829
00:35:21.399 --> 00:35:23.141
Doctor Narby discovered

830
00:35:23.141 --> 00:35:25.401
from taking the compound himself

831
00:35:25.401 --> 00:35:29.601
that when he saw hallucination in front of him,

832
00:35:29.601 --> 00:35:32.941
it was an animal or plant talking to him.

833
00:35:32.941 --> 00:35:36.541
And over several ceremonies and talking with the shamans,

834
00:35:36.541 --> 00:35:39.461
he came to believe in their perspective

835
00:35:39.461 --> 00:35:43.681
which was that that was DNA talking to you.

836
00:35:43.681 --> 00:35:45.441
It wasn't hallucination.

837
00:35:45.441 --> 00:35:48.321
It wasn't a distortion brought on by the drug.

838
00:35:48.321 --> 00:35:52.161
You are getting an opportunity to come back and reflect

839
00:35:52.161 --> 00:35:54.921
that you're surrounded by living beings all the time,

840
00:35:54.921 --> 00:35:56.241
you just can't see them.

841
00:35:56.241 --> 00:35:59.121
Your third eye is not open in other words.

842
00:35:59.121 --> 00:36:01.321
This is what the ancients were doing in my opinion,

843
00:36:01.321 --> 00:36:06.321
the Mayans, and the priests, shamans in Egypt.

844
00:36:06.721 --> 00:36:08.681
They were going through ceremonies

845
00:36:08.681 --> 00:36:12.461
to reconnect with the life around them,

846
00:36:12.461 --> 00:36:15.801
to understand the diseases that may be coming their way,

847
00:36:15.801 --> 00:36:17.901
the plagues,

848
00:36:17.901 --> 00:36:19.961
the crops, how the crops would do.

849
00:36:19.961 --> 00:36:23.381
They were interfacing with the animals, plants

850
00:36:23.381 --> 00:36:24.781
and life forms

851
00:36:24.781 --> 00:36:27.281
that their civilization depended on.

852
00:36:27.281 --> 00:36:29.981
And when they could acquire that knowledge,

853
00:36:29.981 --> 00:36:32.981
they thrived in the golden civilizations.

854
00:36:32.981 --> 00:36:35.201
When they forgot that knowledge

855
00:36:35.201 --> 00:36:37.761
and the environment degraded to the point,

856
00:36:37.761 --> 00:36:39.541
they forgot even about the ceremonies

857
00:36:39.541 --> 00:36:42.221
that would allow them to interface with nature,

858
00:36:42.221 --> 00:36:43.752
they began to die off.

859
00:36:44.922 --> 00:36:48.162
<v Voiceover>And so we, in effect, as Walter Cruttenden</v>

860
00:36:48.162 --> 00:36:50.282
and also John Major Jenkins

861
00:36:50.282 --> 00:36:53.222
speaking about this cycles, these Golden Ages

862
00:36:53.222 --> 00:36:56.302
is not as though we've come from slime,

863
00:36:56.302 --> 00:36:59.064
as if though we evolve and we devolve,

864
00:36:59.064 --> 00:37:02.084
and we evolve and we devolve.

865
00:37:02.084 --> 00:37:04.844
And so where are we right now in your,

866
00:37:04.844 --> 00:37:07.625
where are you seeing the point right now?

867
00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:11.125
<v ->We're on the upward slope of the very steep mountain</v>

868
00:37:11.125 --> 00:37:13.125
but we're on the right path

869
00:37:13.125 --> 00:37:15.006
because you and I, for one, are sitting here

870
00:37:15.006 --> 00:37:16.606
and sharing this information,

871
00:37:16.606 --> 00:37:19.466
we haven't been replaced by a needle-headed alien

872
00:37:19.466 --> 00:37:22.366
or in the other life form that I can see,

873
00:37:22.366 --> 00:37:25.726
and that we're now getting serious about

874
00:37:25.726 --> 00:37:28.766
sharing this information and doing it from our hearts

875
00:37:28.766 --> 00:37:31.166
not just our heads.

876
00:37:31.166 --> 00:37:34.666
And we're putting this as the top priority in our lives,

877
00:37:34.666 --> 00:37:35.926
aren't we?

878
00:37:35.926 --> 00:37:37.066
<v Voiceover>Yes, we are.</v>

879
00:37:37.066 --> 00:37:37.766
<v ->Okay.</v>

880
00:37:37.766 --> 00:37:41.227
So, I see us at the base of a very big mountain,

881
00:37:41.227 --> 00:37:44.047
but we're starting up to the top.

882
00:37:44.047 --> 00:37:45.687
I'm very optimistic,

883
00:37:45.687 --> 00:37:46.847
doesnâ€™t mean there's a lot of

884
00:37:46.847 --> 00:37:50.407
big things coming like tsunamis,

885
00:37:50.407 --> 00:37:54.207
but that's the secondary aspect,

886
00:37:54.207 --> 00:37:56.247
the natural disasters have always occurred.

887
00:37:56.247 --> 00:38:01.247
This is a very vibrant, dynamic earth that we live on,

888
00:38:01.507 --> 00:38:03.507
it is not stable

889
00:38:03.507 --> 00:38:05.667
for very long anywhere, is it?

890
00:38:05.667 --> 00:38:07.368
I mean, the climate can change in a minute

891
00:38:07.368 --> 00:38:09.488
and go from snow to bright sun,

892
00:38:09.488 --> 00:38:11.448
and etcetera, high temperatures.

893
00:38:11.448 --> 00:38:13.808
So this has always occurred.

894
00:38:13.808 --> 00:38:14.948
I think what we'll do though

895
00:38:14.948 --> 00:38:16.830
when a consciousness becomes more integrated,

896
00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:18.850
we're gonna see the climate stabilize,

897
00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:22.761
we're gonna see plants and animals become more healthy,

898
00:38:23.811 --> 00:38:26.731
and people will just naturally become that way

899
00:38:26.731 --> 00:38:28.891
because they're gonna change their diets.

900
00:38:28.891 --> 00:38:31.091
And if for example, if the beef industry,

901
00:38:31.091 --> 00:38:32.551
we don't want anybody to,

902
00:38:32.551 --> 00:38:34.871
I don't wanna pick on to anybody

903
00:38:34.871 --> 00:38:36.851
but if that were to suddenly shift

904
00:38:36.851 --> 00:38:39.011
and not be too important to us anymore,

905
00:38:39.011 --> 00:38:42.032
then they need to be helped to shift into a new economy.

906
00:38:42.032 --> 00:38:45.193
And if, we could do this gracefully as what I'm saying,

907
00:38:45.193 --> 00:38:47.493
but we resist change.

908
00:38:47.493 --> 00:38:49.453
And so I'm sitting here

909
00:38:49.453 --> 00:38:51.093
trying to be an optimist

910
00:38:51.093 --> 00:38:52.773
at the same time reflecting in all the problems

911
00:38:52.773 --> 00:38:54.813
as well as you are doing.

912
00:38:54.813 --> 00:38:58.573
So in that nutshell, again, that's how I see it.

913
00:38:58.573 --> 00:38:59.573
<v Voiceover>So you've been doing</v>

914
00:38:59.573 --> 00:39:00.773
a lot of media these days

915
00:39:00.773 --> 00:39:04.133
and what is that you're really hitting on right now?

916
00:39:04.133 --> 00:39:06.573
What's the nearest and dearest to you?

917
00:39:06.573 --> 00:39:09.453
<v ->What I want us to all understand</v>

918
00:39:09.453 --> 00:39:12.113
is that we need to let fear

919
00:39:12.113 --> 00:39:14.493
dissolve itself and go forward in faith,

920
00:39:14.493 --> 00:39:16.993
share what we know from the heart,

921
00:39:16.993 --> 00:39:20.633
and link together in meaningful ways

922
00:39:20.633 --> 00:39:24.513
to rebuild a new civilization based on peace,

923
00:39:24.513 --> 00:39:26.953
based on wisdom teachings,

924
00:39:26.953 --> 00:39:31.393
and allow everyone to be themselves just,

925
00:39:31.393 --> 00:39:34.753
if we just not try to manipulate and control

926
00:39:34.753 --> 00:39:37.393
and maneuver,

927
00:39:37.393 --> 00:39:39.313
I think things will work out a lot smoother

928
00:39:39.313 --> 00:39:42.184
than if we try to do otherwise.

929
00:39:44.214 --> 00:39:45.934
<v ->To delve deeper into John's work,</v>

930
00:39:45.934 --> 00:39:47.434
pick up a copy of his book,

931
00:39:47.434 --> 00:39:50.774
Tranceformation: Shamans of the 21st Century.

932
00:39:50.774 --> 00:39:53.474
Meanwhile, you can hear him on coast to coast

933
00:39:53.474 --> 00:39:54.754
and other media.

934
00:39:54.754 --> 00:39:57.114
Just check into his website listed on our site.

935
00:39:57.114 --> 00:39:58.114
Until next time.

936
00:39:58.114 --> 00:39:59.414
Thanks for watching.

937
00:39:59.414 --> 00:40:04.414
(calm music)
