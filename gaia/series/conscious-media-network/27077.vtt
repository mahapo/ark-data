00:00:00.386 --> 00:00:02.498
<v ->Michael Tsarion and I have been trying to connect</v>

2
00:00:02.498 --> 00:00:04.631
for a couple of years now and I was thrilled

3
00:00:04.631 --> 00:00:06.903
that our meeting finally took place.

4
00:00:06.903 --> 00:00:08.023
Having followed his work

5
00:00:08.023 --> 00:00:10.668
on Architects of Control on my radio show,

6
00:00:10.668 --> 00:00:12.407
we decided to spend our time together

7
00:00:12.407 --> 00:00:14.103
to talk about his newest books,

8
00:00:14.103 --> 00:00:16.524
The Irish Origins of Civilization.

9
00:00:16.524 --> 00:00:19.681
Michael contends that history, as it's been told,

10
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:22.252
has omitted a significant series of proofs

11
00:00:22.252 --> 00:00:25.665
that not only did the highly advanced Egyptian Civilization

12
00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:28.961
move to the west, to Britain, but prior to that

13
00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:31.286
the ancient Druids moved to Egypt,

14
00:00:31.286 --> 00:00:33.494
taking their language, arts, philosophy

15
00:00:33.494 --> 00:00:35.093
and wisdom with them.

16
00:00:35.093 --> 00:00:38.048
Their disappearance has caused cataclysmic events

17
00:00:38.048 --> 00:00:40.826
to occur on this planet, according to Michael.

18
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:42.514
(gentle music)

19
00:00:49.997 --> 00:00:51.672
<v Voiceover>Everywhere we look we're seeing structures</v>

20
00:00:51.672 --> 00:00:54.573
beginning to crack, even crumble

21
00:00:54.573 --> 00:00:58.124
and I think it's becoming obvious that there are,

22
00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:00.652
as the title of your film says,

23
00:01:00.652 --> 00:01:02.977
there are architects in control of all of this

24
00:01:02.977 --> 00:01:04.183
that's going on.

25
00:01:04.183 --> 00:01:06.881
What are you seeing as the dominant effects

26
00:01:06.881 --> 00:01:09.110
of the controllers right now?

27
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.753
<v ->Well, there's many threats.</v>

28
00:01:10.753 --> 00:01:12.748
There's, the first thing to realize

29
00:01:12.748 --> 00:01:15.925
is the architecture of control is very ancient.

30
00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:18.805
That never changes even though it progresses, you know.

31
00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:21.450
People can say if they want from the historical ages

32
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.765
or if they prefer, like I do, to say it's even more ancient

33
00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:24.885
than that.

34
00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:27.882
Second thing is that the architects of control change

35
00:01:27.882 --> 00:01:29.780
because, of course, some come, they die

36
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.362
and then the new generation springs up, you know.

37
00:01:32.362 --> 00:01:35.892
So this thing is ever increasing

38
00:01:35.892 --> 00:01:39.210
as new people are recruited into (mumbling).

39
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.302
The architects of control have a recruitment situation.

40
00:01:41.302 --> 00:01:43.947
They have a bloodline we've spoken about before.

41
00:01:43.947 --> 00:01:46.646
And also, it's not just that they may be

42
00:01:46.646 --> 00:01:49.526
biologically descended from a strict bloodline.

43
00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:52.011
I believe that does exist and I've written on it,

44
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:54.709
but there's also the situation, the question

45
00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:57.312
of ideological identification,

46
00:01:57.312 --> 00:01:58.677
which comes from the training,

47
00:01:58.677 --> 00:02:01.930
you know, the influence of these people's parents.

48
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.501
You know, and the rest of the kind of rituals

49
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:07.274
that these people are subjected to and so forth and so on.

50
00:02:07.274 --> 00:02:09.354
So people can focus on that, which then brings you to

51
00:02:09.354 --> 00:02:11.188
individual members.

52
00:02:11.188 --> 00:02:13.119
The Winston Churchills, the Margaret Thatchers,

53
00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:15.167
you know, the Cecil Rhodeses, you know.

54
00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:17.556
Then you're into sort of these individuals

55
00:02:17.556 --> 00:02:20.361
and who can conceive what and when.

56
00:02:20.361 --> 00:02:23.913
And some people may point to philosophers.

57
00:02:23.913 --> 00:02:25.705
You know, people have pointed to Aristotle, Plato,

58
00:02:25.705 --> 00:02:27.998
Nietzsche, you know, whether you agree with that or not.

59
00:02:27.998 --> 00:02:30.974
Who are the people who conceived this conceptually?

60
00:02:30.974 --> 00:02:33.182
You know, and we may agree or disagree on those.

61
00:02:33.182 --> 00:02:35.507
Then we have the executors.

62
00:02:35.507 --> 00:02:37.085
You know, who are much lower level

63
00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:38.941
when it comes to the pyramid.

64
00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:40.207
So we can always focus on those things.

65
00:02:40.207 --> 00:02:40.730
<v Voiceover>But they're the ones</v>

66
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.522
we tend to interface with and feel the presence

67
00:02:42.522 --> 00:02:43.258
of more.

68
00:02:43.258 --> 00:02:44.324
<v ->Yeah, so, in fact, it's good though</v>

69
00:02:44.324 --> 00:02:46.490
because then when you do expose some shenanigans

70
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.972
from an Alfred Milner, right,

71
00:02:47.972 --> 00:02:49.177
or Colonel Mandell House

72
00:02:49.177 --> 00:02:51.897
or Cecil Rhodes, people are more likely to believe you

73
00:02:51.897 --> 00:02:53.433
because there it is in black and white.

74
00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:54.873
And the same person can say,

75
00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:55.961
"Well, bit dodgey there

76
00:02:55.961 --> 00:02:58.905
"and there seems to be these underworld connections."

77
00:02:58.905 --> 00:03:00.675
<v Voiceover>But the rest of it is really faceless,</v>

78
00:03:00.675 --> 00:03:01.369
nameless.

79
00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:02.627
<v ->And more hard to prove.
<v Voiceover>These are people</v>

80
00:03:02.627 --> 00:03:04.643
that blend so far back that we can't ever see them,

81
00:03:04.643 --> 00:03:06.360
they're so many layers back, right?

82
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.270
<v ->Right and also more difficult to prove.</v>

83
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.019
As you step away from dealing with the architects

84
00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.131
and start dealing with architecture,

85
00:03:13.131 --> 00:03:14.848
you're a little bit more into the abstract.

86
00:03:14.848 --> 00:03:16.181
You're a little bit more into areas

87
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:18.336
that is harder to prove for people.

88
00:03:18.336 --> 00:03:19.671
Because at that point, you have to have

89
00:03:19.671 --> 00:03:21.038
a certain kind of mind as well.

90
00:03:21.038 --> 00:03:22.712
You have to have a very synergistic mind.

91
00:03:22.712 --> 00:03:24.643
You have to have a very conceptual mind.

92
00:03:24.643 --> 00:03:27.107
You have to be, to put it in layman's terms,

93
00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:29.976
standing not too close to the great canvas of life

94
00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:31.608
and not too far away.

95
00:03:31.608 --> 00:03:33.246
What we're finding in these,

96
00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:36.013
well you find this in every modality of thought,

97
00:03:36.013 --> 00:03:37.181
but you certainly find it again

98
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:39.367
in the so-called Alternative Movement,

99
00:03:39.367 --> 00:03:40.995
is that either people have got their face stuck

100
00:03:40.995 --> 00:03:42.868
up into the canvas and going, "This is it.

101
00:03:42.868 --> 00:03:44.239
"It's this color, okay? It's this."

102
00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.028
<v Voiceover>They're too close.</v>

103
00:03:45.028 --> 00:03:47.236
<v ->"It's them. It's the Illuminati.</v>

104
00:03:47.236 --> 00:03:49.252
"It's the Jesuits." Whatever.

105
00:03:49.252 --> 00:03:50.350
And they're right.

106
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.065
They can be right.

107
00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:53.198
But their only looking at one little brush mark

108
00:03:53.198 --> 00:03:54.851
or two little brush marks, right?

109
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:55.801
And then you got the other kind

110
00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:57.816
who's standing too far away.

111
00:03:57.816 --> 00:03:59.630
And then they don't know the specifics.

112
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.699
They go, "Yeah, I know there's a hidden government.

113
00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:03.832
"Yeah, I get it, you know, so what?

114
00:04:03.832 --> 00:04:04.813
"Change the channel.

115
00:04:04.813 --> 00:04:06.253
"I'm gonna go and watch some football now."

116
00:04:06.253 --> 00:04:08.386
Right? So you have to be standing

117
00:04:08.386 --> 00:04:11.426
sort of at a certain, and a good artist does this anyway.

118
00:04:11.426 --> 00:04:13.412
The man who's painting the picture had to do it,

119
00:04:13.412 --> 00:04:14.402
why don't you?

120
00:04:14.402 --> 00:04:16.589
<v Voiceover>Right, you painted a stroke or two,</v>

121
00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:17.410
you back up.

122
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.309
<v ->Oh, they know that Leonardo da Vinci visited</v>

123
00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:21.324
his own paintings for sometimes 14 hours a day

124
00:04:21.324 --> 00:04:22.540
just to sit and look at it.

125
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.441
To, you know, stand close, to go far away.

126
00:04:25.441 --> 00:04:26.945
This is what an artist does.

127
00:04:26.945 --> 00:04:28.204
This is what an art critic does.

128
00:04:28.204 --> 00:04:32.726
It's no different in life, so when you find,

129
00:04:32.726 --> 00:04:33.284
and it takes time.

130
00:04:33.284 --> 00:04:34.841
This can take years just to get to

131
00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:36.238
the perspective I'm talking about,

132
00:04:36.238 --> 00:04:39.651
can take years for people to just get that.

133
00:04:39.651 --> 00:04:41.326
Because, you know, and it happened for me too.

134
00:04:41.326 --> 00:04:42.819
Sometimes I was too close to the canvas

135
00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:45.027
and you're like, you got this bug bear about one thing

136
00:04:45.027 --> 00:04:46.627
and you think you've found it.

137
00:04:46.627 --> 00:04:49.432
And you become sort of a little bit

138
00:04:49.432 --> 00:04:50.712
obsessed by that or whatever.

139
00:04:50.712 --> 00:04:52.642
Then you pull, there can be a swing

140
00:04:52.642 --> 00:04:54.776
where you're pulled too far back

141
00:04:54.776 --> 00:04:57.047
and then you kind of lose the detail,

142
00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:58.722
but there's an upside of that

143
00:04:58.722 --> 00:05:00.258
is that you start to see the global-ness

144
00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:01.346
of this kind of thing, you know,

145
00:05:01.346 --> 00:05:04.524
and you get familiar with the hues and the textures.

146
00:05:04.524 --> 00:05:05.922
But as I said, coming back to your point,

147
00:05:05.922 --> 00:05:07.841
when you start dealing with the architecture,

148
00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:09.239
you need a synergistic mind

149
00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:10.327
and there's not too many teachers

150
00:05:10.327 --> 00:05:11.052
who can do that.

151
00:05:11.052 --> 00:05:12.609
There's not too many people who can do that

152
00:05:12.609 --> 00:05:15.393
so my slant now, after all these years,

153
00:05:15.393 --> 00:05:18.134
has become more to yeah, keep on dealing with

154
00:05:18.134 --> 00:05:20.897
the sort of practical examples,

155
00:05:20.897 --> 00:05:22.496
but other people have done that wonderfully.

156
00:05:22.496 --> 00:05:24.683
This is fantastically canvased, my god.

157
00:05:24.683 --> 00:05:27.136
You know, I mean, from the time of the earliest writers

158
00:05:27.136 --> 00:05:29.248
on conspiracy, G. Edward Giffin, Eustace Mullins,

159
00:05:29.248 --> 00:05:31.627
you know, Gary Allen, you name it.

160
00:05:31.627 --> 00:05:32.970
There's a whole list of these people.

161
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.157
And hope the viewers are familiar with these people.

162
00:05:35.157 --> 00:05:36.458
And including David Icke and others

163
00:05:36.458 --> 00:05:38.080
who are doing wonderful work on this.

164
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.986
This is beautifully done.

165
00:05:38.986 --> 00:05:39.807
There's been case histories.

166
00:05:39.807 --> 00:05:40.341
There's profiles.

167
00:05:40.341 --> 00:05:42.239
These people have been exposed thoroughly.

168
00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:43.636
We're talking even about the Queen of England

169
00:05:43.636 --> 00:05:45.332
and all her coterie, and all of these,

170
00:05:45.332 --> 00:05:47.444
you know, monstrosities.

171
00:05:47.444 --> 00:05:49.993
At the same time, then it's good to sometimes say,

172
00:05:49.993 --> 00:05:51.231
yeah, but this is very ancient,

173
00:05:51.231 --> 00:05:52.692
to show the whole architectural.

174
00:05:52.692 --> 00:05:56.286
So in the recent work, Irish Origins of Civilization

175
00:05:56.286 --> 00:05:59.209
specifically, and I'm hoping to get into that more

176
00:05:59.209 --> 00:06:01.107
because I want to actually make sure that people understand

177
00:06:01.107 --> 00:06:03.614
why I'm even using the word Irish for a start.

178
00:06:03.614 --> 00:06:05.214
<v Voiceover>Most people have said, "What?"</v>

179
00:06:05.214 --> 00:06:06.771
<v Michael>Yeah.</v>
<v ->Just hearing that.</v>

180
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:08.296
What, Irish origins?

181
00:06:08.296 --> 00:06:09.534
<v ->The very word has to be defined</v>

182
00:06:09.534 --> 00:06:10.995
because it's not a travel guide,

183
00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:14.269
heritage, Irish history context.

184
00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:15.890
The word Irish is a very specific word

185
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.141
that most Irish people don't even know what it means.

186
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:21.213
But getting out of that, the idea is that the Irish book

187
00:06:21.213 --> 00:06:24.039
was done again to take this thing back

188
00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:25.714
to show the ideological connections

189
00:06:25.714 --> 00:06:28.988
and to start showing how this thing began.

190
00:06:28.988 --> 00:06:30.610
What's it all about? You know?

191
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.308
How does, 'cause if you're seeing something today,

192
00:06:33.308 --> 00:06:36.423
a tyranny, a pestilence, some sort of pathogenic thing,

193
00:06:36.423 --> 00:06:38.874
a mental epidemic or whatever,

194
00:06:38.874 --> 00:06:41.701
that's infecting people and making them sociopathic

195
00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:45.167
and fragmented, my god, if that, steamroller,

196
00:06:45.167 --> 00:06:46.330
if that caboose is still moving,

197
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.951
it must've had one hell of an engine

198
00:06:47.951 --> 00:06:50.180
or an impulse to move it in the first place.

199
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.314
And Jordan, Maxwell and I, we've always addressed

200
00:06:52.314 --> 00:06:54.543
this thing about what is at the top of the pyramid?

201
00:06:54.543 --> 00:06:55.609
You can't understand the bottom

202
00:06:55.609 --> 00:06:57.284
unless you understand the top.

203
00:06:57.284 --> 00:06:59.513
Who is operating from the top part?

204
00:06:59.513 --> 00:07:01.924
And so the top part also has four sides.

205
00:07:01.924 --> 00:07:05.219
So even that's not too easy to discover even then

206
00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:07.107
'cause even one perspective is not good enough.

207
00:07:07.107 --> 00:07:08.942
You gotta do some circum-numbulating here

208
00:07:08.942 --> 00:07:10.659
and you'll get things wrong.

209
00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:12.355
You're gonna get things wrong.

210
00:07:12.355 --> 00:07:13.976
Because the sun, you know, the light

211
00:07:13.976 --> 00:07:15.235
may not be right today

212
00:07:15.235 --> 00:07:17.229
or emotions may color the thing.

213
00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:18.925
Listening to a bunch of other voices

214
00:07:18.925 --> 00:07:21.101
may interfere.

215
00:07:21.101 --> 00:07:22.658
Not, the best way, you see, is,

216
00:07:22.658 --> 00:07:25.517
and remember, not everyone has the same approach.

217
00:07:25.517 --> 00:07:27.682
There's a different understanding of this.

218
00:07:27.682 --> 00:07:30.613
Just like in the same way you can use the same words

219
00:07:30.613 --> 00:07:32.610
and mean different things.

220
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.597
So the incredible thing is

221
00:07:34.597 --> 00:07:35.983
that never to lose sight of the fact

222
00:07:35.983 --> 00:07:37.818
that how ancient is this thing.

223
00:07:37.818 --> 00:07:39.652
And what kind of impulse started it?

224
00:07:39.652 --> 00:07:41.540
And then we're into the world of a solar cult.

225
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.023
Then we're back into the world of astrology

226
00:07:43.023 --> 00:07:44.772
and astro theology.

227
00:07:44.772 --> 00:07:46.351
We're going back to the roots of Christianity

228
00:07:46.351 --> 00:07:47.929
and Judeo-Christianity.

229
00:07:47.929 --> 00:07:49.710
Whether the people who are into those religions

230
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:50.809
accept this or not,

231
00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:53.635
it's a bonafide effect that the stars, the heavens

232
00:07:53.635 --> 00:07:55.075
was the original temple of God.

233
00:07:55.075 --> 00:07:56.281
It's referenced in the Bible

234
00:07:56.281 --> 00:07:58.606
multiple places in code.

235
00:07:58.606 --> 00:08:01.646
The Bible is absolutely loaded with Druidic

236
00:08:01.646 --> 00:08:04.440
symbolism, and then again, to even use the word Druidic,

237
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.549
we need to have that defined.

238
00:08:05.549 --> 00:08:07.704
Is it the same as it's been presented?

239
00:08:07.704 --> 00:08:10.658
Is it the same as what has been presented before?

240
00:08:10.658 --> 00:08:12.984
You know, what does the word really mean?

241
00:08:12.984 --> 00:08:14.274
Was it used in other countries?

242
00:08:14.274 --> 00:08:15.810
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

243
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.805
So just in the mere definition of names,

244
00:08:17.805 --> 00:08:19.671
and this for me started way back in 1980,

245
00:08:19.671 --> 00:08:21.079
that's how I got interested in it.

246
00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:23.340
The mere looking at the deconstruction

247
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.938
of these terms that have been handed to us

248
00:08:24.938 --> 00:08:26.025
in the media and the mainstream

249
00:08:26.025 --> 00:08:28.927
was of great fascination to me personally.

250
00:08:28.927 --> 00:08:29.737
I didn't have a big picture.

251
00:08:29.737 --> 00:08:31.081
<v Voiceover>You're an etymologist really.</v>

252
00:08:31.081 --> 00:08:34.708
<v ->Well, I studied the etymologist and philologist, you know.</v>

253
00:08:34.708 --> 00:08:37.097
I'm not in any sense an academic expert

254
00:08:37.097 --> 00:08:38.814
or anything like that.

255
00:08:38.814 --> 00:08:39.881
But I don't think you have to be.

256
00:08:39.881 --> 00:08:40.723
<v Voiceover>No, you've laid down</v>

257
00:08:40.723 --> 00:08:42.622
some really fine findings.

258
00:08:42.622 --> 00:08:44.414
<v ->And I think these are all eclectic.</v>

259
00:08:44.414 --> 00:08:46.920
Just like language itself is ecelctic.

260
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.221
So is the study of language

261
00:08:48.221 --> 00:08:50.099
and also I'm very against academic,

262
00:08:50.099 --> 00:08:52.562
you know, all knowledge is free for all people.

263
00:08:52.562 --> 00:08:54.258
It cannot be owned or territorialized

264
00:08:54.258 --> 00:08:56.669
as the Orthodox, you know, university systems

265
00:08:56.669 --> 00:09:00.199
want to do and the basic fact in my life,

266
00:09:00.199 --> 00:09:02.407
you know, an academic is basically somebody

267
00:09:02.407 --> 00:09:04.455
who's got like a, you know, university degree

268
00:09:04.455 --> 00:09:06.940
on the front of their chest but a target on the back.

269
00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.276
And they're comprised individuals.

270
00:09:09.276 --> 00:09:12.295
So we have to question how really objective their work is.

271
00:09:12.295 --> 00:09:14.385
That's not to say that the professor Thompsons,

272
00:09:14.385 --> 00:09:15.644
you see, and others from within

273
00:09:15.644 --> 00:09:16.668
haven't done wonderful work,

274
00:09:16.668 --> 00:09:17.852
but then they lose their jobs.

275
00:09:17.852 --> 00:09:18.758
They're demoted.

276
00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:20.753
Even people at the top of the totem pole.

277
00:09:20.753 --> 00:09:22.651
You know, I could list many, many great scholars

278
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:23.910
and still today

279
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:24.998
who are writing wonderful books

280
00:09:24.998 --> 00:09:26.160
on the origins of Judaism

281
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.835
and the origins of all of this kind of thing,

282
00:09:27.835 --> 00:09:28.603
who delving into this,

283
00:09:28.603 --> 00:09:31.781
but they are, they risk.

284
00:09:31.781 --> 00:09:33.083
You see, and they're gonna be a minority

285
00:09:33.083 --> 00:09:34.448
right across the board.

286
00:09:34.448 --> 00:09:35.450
You know, I mean, people screamed

287
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.349
about, you know, the Egyptians never used a ship

288
00:09:37.349 --> 00:09:39.834
until they dig one up about five feet from the pyramid.

289
00:09:39.834 --> 00:09:41.765
People said there was no such things (mumbling)

290
00:09:41.765 --> 00:09:43.855
until they dig, you know, their scrolls up from the deserts.

291
00:09:43.855 --> 00:09:45.967
You know, endless antidotes like this, you see.

292
00:09:45.967 --> 00:09:49.359
So we're in the age now of this revision

293
00:09:49.359 --> 00:09:51.983
of history and that includes the revision of words,

294
00:09:51.983 --> 00:09:54.020
the revision of language, the revision or terms,

295
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.833
the revision of symbolism.

296
00:09:55.833 --> 00:09:57.902
And almost everything we've been taught

297
00:09:57.902 --> 00:09:59.225
right across the board.

298
00:09:59.225 --> 00:10:00.249
We're not looking for experts.

299
00:10:00.249 --> 00:10:01.497
We're not looking for authorities.

300
00:10:01.497 --> 00:10:04.750
We're looking for people who've got that eclectic synthetic

301
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.233
omnidirectional mind, you see,

302
00:10:06.233 --> 00:10:10.062
that can start to be okay with a deconstructive model.

303
00:10:10.062 --> 00:10:12.941
Don't worry about what's gonna come out of it.

304
00:10:12.941 --> 00:10:15.032
Let the old system, you know, take it apart.

305
00:10:15.032 --> 00:10:16.845
This is what the Uranian energy is also about.

306
00:10:16.845 --> 00:10:18.662
It's sort of fragmenting of everything to take it apart,

307
00:10:18.662 --> 00:10:20.027
to examine what it is.

308
00:10:20.027 --> 00:10:21.936
Open the shell, let's see what this is made of really.

309
00:10:21.936 --> 00:10:23.141
What's its components.

310
00:10:23.141 --> 00:10:25.047
And if we don't need it anymore, throw it out.

311
00:10:25.047 --> 00:10:27.255
Course that threatens a lot of people.

312
00:10:27.255 --> 00:10:29.271
But to finish up, you know, on the first point,

313
00:10:29.271 --> 00:10:31.873
basically, then you're into the solar cult.

314
00:10:31.873 --> 00:10:34.476
You're going back to the fundamentals of religion.

315
00:10:34.476 --> 00:10:37.889
You're going back to the fundamentals of communication,

316
00:10:37.889 --> 00:10:40.182
cosmology, thinking, thought,

317
00:10:40.182 --> 00:10:41.857
the zodiac and the inner zodiac.

318
00:10:41.857 --> 00:10:44.246
You're going back to the reasons why

319
00:10:44.246 --> 00:10:47.403
man thought it was important to erect pillars,

320
00:10:47.403 --> 00:10:50.816
obelisks, why they made the megaliths,.

321
00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:53.227
The relationship with, you know, the cosmoths

322
00:10:53.227 --> 00:10:54.805
was a relationship with the mother.

323
00:10:54.805 --> 00:10:56.320
You know, the divine mother, the presence

324
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.154
that they never lost contact with.

325
00:10:58.154 --> 00:11:01.098
With nature, which is the ultimate guide.

326
00:11:01.098 --> 00:11:03.754
Which is the ultimate teacher and tutor, you see.

327
00:11:03.754 --> 00:11:05.279
So you're going back to all of that,

328
00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:08.180
which today is looked at as sort of a primitivism.

329
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:08.831
<v Voiceover>Paganism.</v>

330
00:11:08.831 --> 00:11:11.338
<v ->Paganism, you know, not understanding, as I said,</v>

331
00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:12.831
the Bible's full of it, you know.

332
00:11:12.831 --> 00:11:13.961
I can take you through chapter and verse

333
00:11:13.961 --> 00:11:17.172
to show you the Druidic (mumbling) motifs in there.

334
00:11:17.172 --> 00:11:18.238
The average Christian doesn't know it

335
00:11:18.238 --> 00:11:20.308
well 'cause the average Christian doesn't study Druidism.

336
00:11:20.308 --> 00:11:21.513
My work will introduce them to that

337
00:11:21.513 --> 00:11:22.558
then they can see it for themselves.

338
00:11:22.558 --> 00:11:24.489
I'm not making a story up here.

339
00:11:24.489 --> 00:11:27.923
The harp, the tree, the oak, the fig leaf, you know.

340
00:11:27.923 --> 00:11:31.006
The man in white robes, right.

341
00:11:31.006 --> 00:11:32.307
Meeting Jehovah at the burning bush,

342
00:11:32.307 --> 00:11:33.256
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera

343
00:11:33.256 --> 00:11:35.517
are actually from a particular (mumbling).

344
00:11:35.517 --> 00:11:37.416
They're actually from a particular archive,

345
00:11:37.416 --> 00:11:39.208
not the Judaic archive as we know it

346
00:11:39.208 --> 00:11:41.437
and not the Christian archive as we know it.

347
00:11:41.437 --> 00:11:43.453
So this opens up a whole fascinating study.

348
00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:45.287
<v Voiceover>Well let's just jump into that can of worms</v>

349
00:11:45.287 --> 00:11:47.634
because it's often thought, well,

350
00:11:47.634 --> 00:11:50.300
we go beyond the Christian era.

351
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.114
We go back into the Egyptian eras

352
00:11:52.114 --> 00:11:54.343
and some of the more ancient Egyptian civilizations,

353
00:11:54.343 --> 00:11:57.479
even into Samarian, Babylonian and so forth.

354
00:11:57.479 --> 00:11:59.409
And so it's been thought up to this point

355
00:11:59.409 --> 00:12:01.052
that there was a migration, right?

356
00:12:01.052 --> 00:12:02.726
From the East
<v Michael>Right.</v>

357
00:12:02.726 --> 00:12:04.881
<v Voiceover>or Southeast to the Northwest.</v>

358
00:12:04.881 --> 00:12:07.323
To Ireland and that Ireland, a lot of what Ireland's

359
00:12:07.323 --> 00:12:10.289
more advanced civilization from ancient times displaced

360
00:12:10.289 --> 00:12:11.760
really came from somewhere else.

361
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.352
But you're saying it's exactly the opposite.

362
00:12:14.352 --> 00:12:16.656
<v ->Both, ultimately it's the opposite,</v>

363
00:12:16.656 --> 00:12:18.331
but let's just take it in steps.

364
00:12:18.331 --> 00:12:20.901
Yes there was East to West migrations,

365
00:12:20.901 --> 00:12:21.946
but they were later.

366
00:12:21.946 --> 00:12:23.461
<v Voiceover>Yes, and let's get into that.</v>

367
00:12:23.461 --> 00:12:25.338
That's a very important distinction

368
00:12:25.338 --> 00:12:27.525
that is not being made anywhere (mumbling).

369
00:12:27.525 --> 00:12:30.981
<v ->Yeah, and let's just look at not my work,</v>

370
00:12:30.981 --> 00:12:32.420
but other works, the Graham Hancocks,

371
00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.532
the Michael Cremos and before them

372
00:12:34.532 --> 00:12:37.849
you even have the Eric (mumbling).

373
00:12:37.849 --> 00:12:39.620
The cat is out of the bag proving

374
00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.913
that obviously our history does not open

375
00:12:41.913 --> 00:12:45.241
7,000 years ago or even 11,000 years ago.

376
00:12:45.241 --> 00:12:47.726
In Christianity, they said that the entire creation

377
00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:49.507
was 4,000 years old.

378
00:12:49.507 --> 00:12:50.350
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

379
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:51.246
<v ->That's what I'm talking about.</v>

380
00:12:51.246 --> 00:12:53.315
That kind of bogus nonsense is in the science world

381
00:12:53.315 --> 00:12:55.843
telling you that it all, history traditionally opened

382
00:12:55.843 --> 00:12:57.262
because some baskets were found

383
00:12:57.262 --> 00:12:59.011
or the first numerical system

384
00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:01.165
is been completely demolished.

385
00:13:01.165 --> 00:13:02.627
You know, by people who even are going takin'

386
00:13:02.627 --> 00:13:04.674
photographs of it under water and what not

387
00:13:04.674 --> 00:13:06.200
to show you that this is nonsense.

388
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.245
Of course any sane man knows.
<v Voiceover>Such as Graham</v>

389
00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:07.778
Hancock.

390
00:13:07.778 --> 00:13:08.877
<v ->Such as Graham Hancock.</v>

391
00:13:08.877 --> 00:13:10.797
And therefore, but any sane man

392
00:13:10.797 --> 00:13:12.429
even before their work would've known this.

393
00:13:12.429 --> 00:13:13.709
And many have.

394
00:13:13.709 --> 00:13:15.607
Okay, let's go from there.

395
00:13:15.607 --> 00:13:18.210
The reason why they wanted an ice age

396
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:21.015
inserted between, you know, the Holocene and the Pleistocene

397
00:13:21.015 --> 00:13:22.647
or the Pleistocene Epoch, if you really want

398
00:13:22.647 --> 00:13:23.404
to be technical about it,

399
00:13:23.404 --> 00:13:25.921
they insert this thing with ice ages

400
00:13:25.921 --> 00:13:28.214
between the post and pre diluvian.

401
00:13:28.214 --> 00:13:29.814
Why they wanted to make sure that history

402
00:13:29.814 --> 00:13:32.299
began at the seven to 11,000 years ago

403
00:13:32.299 --> 00:13:35.137
is for a very good reasons, propaganda.

404
00:13:35.137 --> 00:13:37.942
Is to make sure that nobody who is born later today

405
00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:39.470
or in the modern age will look back.

406
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:41.099
If you put this ice sheet there,

407
00:13:41.099 --> 00:13:42.808
if you put this naked world there,

408
00:13:42.808 --> 00:13:45.411
if you put this world and cataclysm there.

409
00:13:45.411 --> 00:13:46.221
<v Voiceover>No history.</v>

410
00:13:46.221 --> 00:13:47.896
<v ->Wooly mammoths and all that, no history.</v>

411
00:13:47.896 --> 00:13:48.781
No reason to look back.

412
00:13:48.781 --> 00:13:52.141
It's exactly the same, and I mean exactly the same

413
00:13:52.141 --> 00:13:54.626
as when the Vatican said, "Well, you can't be sailing ships

414
00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:56.141
"to the west of the world

415
00:13:56.141 --> 00:13:58.178
"because you're gonna fall of the edge."

416
00:13:58.178 --> 00:13:59.161
There is no difference--

417
00:13:59.161 --> 00:14:00.281
<v Voiceover>Scared a lot of young kids</v>

418
00:14:00.281 --> 00:14:02.019
with an exploring spirit.

419
00:14:02.019 --> 00:14:03.278
<v ->At that point they would've said anything</v>

420
00:14:03.278 --> 00:14:03.950
and they did.

421
00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.296
The Western Isles were always considered the goulish

422
00:14:06.296 --> 00:14:08.429
other worldly, misty isles and people believed this

423
00:14:08.429 --> 00:14:10.563
right up to the time of Galileo and even beyond.

424
00:14:10.563 --> 00:14:11.887
And think actually have (mumbling)

425
00:14:11.887 --> 00:14:13.604
who still believe it today.

426
00:14:13.604 --> 00:14:15.347
Alright, so the thing is that that worked

427
00:14:15.347 --> 00:14:16.670
to stop people physically going there

428
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.248
because they knew man of finances, man of money

429
00:14:18.248 --> 00:14:21.331
might independently get ships and go and find out

430
00:14:21.331 --> 00:14:22.536
what the real story is.

431
00:14:22.536 --> 00:14:24.648
So the Vatican made an all out prohibition on that

432
00:14:24.648 --> 00:14:27.090
by saying that the world was flat.

433
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.277
The thinkers did it historically by saying,

434
00:14:29.277 --> 00:14:30.205
"Well, it's flat.

435
00:14:30.205 --> 00:14:32.754
"There's no history before x."

436
00:14:32.754 --> 00:14:34.057
And anyway, half the world, three quarters

437
00:14:34.057 --> 00:14:35.273
was a bunch of pygmies and primatives

438
00:14:35.273 --> 00:14:36.456
so we don't even need to worry about them.

439
00:14:36.456 --> 00:14:37.662
They're gonna be conquered and colonized

440
00:14:37.662 --> 00:14:38.963
and they don't have a history.

441
00:14:38.963 --> 00:14:40.030
And if they do, we'll wipe it off

442
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.077
so same result.

443
00:14:42.077 --> 00:14:43.229
Western man, European man,

444
00:14:43.229 --> 00:14:44.093
he's got the history.

445
00:14:44.093 --> 00:14:46.418
He's the big kahuna, right?

446
00:14:46.418 --> 00:14:48.904
So all of these mechanisms plus the more subtle

447
00:14:48.904 --> 00:14:51.197
diachronic and synchronic manipulation of time

448
00:14:51.197 --> 00:14:53.863
and history, the Hegelian , you know, Dialectical pattern,

449
00:14:53.863 --> 00:14:54.514
if you want to get into that,

450
00:14:54.514 --> 00:14:56.071
there's all these various forms

451
00:14:56.071 --> 00:14:59.207
that these agents, all of the aristocracy,

452
00:14:59.207 --> 00:15:01.618
the (mumbling) have used to prevent

453
00:15:01.618 --> 00:15:03.943
man looking back to these,

454
00:15:03.943 --> 00:15:05.182
in other words, the true history.

455
00:15:05.182 --> 00:15:06.173
<v Voiceover>What were they afraid of?</v>

456
00:15:06.173 --> 00:15:07.101
What were they going to find?

457
00:15:07.101 --> 00:15:09.331
<v ->Well, let's go straight on then to the next step.</v>

458
00:15:09.331 --> 00:15:11.240
This idea that I've worked with a lot,

459
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.426
which is the opposite as you were talking about.

460
00:15:13.426 --> 00:15:15.069
The movement of the elements of civilization

461
00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:18.301
from the Western, Northwestern hemisphere

462
00:15:18.301 --> 00:15:20.551
to the East.

463
00:15:20.551 --> 00:15:21.458
I'm not the first.

464
00:15:21.458 --> 00:15:23.911
This was, first it was a woman

465
00:15:23.911 --> 00:15:26.588
by the name Anna Wilkes in 1889

466
00:15:26.588 --> 00:15:28.743
who wrote a book, you know, on this.

467
00:15:28.743 --> 00:15:30.972
Then followed up by the great Conor MacDari.

468
00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:32.646
And then Comyns Beaumont in the 1960's.

469
00:15:32.646 --> 00:15:34.342
<v Voiceover>And you have a lot of references in your book.</v>

470
00:15:34.342 --> 00:15:36.380
<v ->Yeah, basically, my work is as I consider</v>

471
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.726
little more than a homage to them.

472
00:15:38.726 --> 00:15:40.166
You know, okay, somebody might say

473
00:15:40.166 --> 00:15:41.265
you know, these are your own ideas.

474
00:15:41.265 --> 00:15:43.950
And I guess they are my own ideas there.

475
00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:45.040
Ultimately, the books were written,

476
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.920
in fact, my happiest experience was writing the chapter

477
00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.520
on Comyns Beaumont.

478
00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:52.285
It felt like to me it was a great,

479
00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:53.469
I actually really don't even want to get into it.

480
00:15:53.469 --> 00:15:54.909
It's a very personal thing

481
00:15:54.909 --> 00:15:58.322
to even be able to do that chapter on that man

482
00:15:58.322 --> 00:16:01.575
it was like a period at the end of a sentence for me.

483
00:16:01.575 --> 00:16:02.898
You know? That's all I can say.

484
00:16:02.898 --> 00:16:04.637
But yeah, to do homage to the other ones as well

485
00:16:04.637 --> 00:16:07.164
was really great and to my own ancestors ultimately.

486
00:16:07.164 --> 00:16:08.327
You know, the book is dedicated

487
00:16:08.327 --> 00:16:10.695
to the spirit of the ancestors, you know,

488
00:16:10.695 --> 00:16:12.465
in my own land, as sort of an homage

489
00:16:12.465 --> 00:16:13.415
that I lived in that land.

490
00:16:13.415 --> 00:16:14.556
I was born there, you know.

491
00:16:14.556 --> 00:16:16.764
So it's my way of giving something back.

492
00:16:16.764 --> 00:16:18.012
It is polemical.

493
00:16:18.012 --> 00:16:18.961
It is rebellious.

494
00:16:18.961 --> 00:16:20.337
It's meant to be.

495
00:16:20.337 --> 00:16:20.988
You know, one of my--

496
00:16:20.988 --> 00:16:22.865
<v Voiceover>But that's the nature of the Irish people.</v>

497
00:16:22.865 --> 00:16:24.998
Isn't that part of the spirit?

498
00:16:24.998 --> 00:16:26.353
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

499
00:16:26.353 --> 00:16:29.766
And one of my Irish mentors,

500
00:16:29.766 --> 00:16:30.717
Patrick McGoohan, you know,

501
00:16:30.717 --> 00:16:32.338
when he was asked about the making of The Prisoner,

502
00:16:32.338 --> 00:16:34.450
he goes, "I wanted fists up in my face."

503
00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:35.911
So basically, that's, you know

504
00:16:35.911 --> 00:16:36.808
<v Voiceover>You put some</v>

505
00:16:36.808 --> 00:16:37.480
<v ->the way I look at it</v>

506
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.547
<v Voiceover>fists up here on this one</v>

507
00:16:38.547 --> 00:16:41.544
and you're talking, you, okay,

508
00:16:41.544 --> 00:16:42.749
just continue what you'r saying

509
00:16:42.749 --> 00:16:44.349
because we can jump into this story

510
00:16:44.349 --> 00:16:45.810
at so many points.

511
00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:46.898
You tell it.
<v Michael>Well just briefly</v>

512
00:16:46.898 --> 00:16:49.362
then, the idea that just a take on board the fact

513
00:16:49.362 --> 00:16:51.335
that what is so difficult

514
00:16:51.335 --> 00:16:52.711
to go out your garden gate

515
00:16:52.711 --> 00:16:53.895
and make a right?

516
00:16:53.895 --> 00:16:55.868
If you can make a right you can make a left.

517
00:16:55.868 --> 00:16:58.258
So what is the big problem, the big obstacle

518
00:16:58.258 --> 00:17:01.255
with realizing that it might've been the other way?

519
00:17:01.255 --> 00:17:03.089
And remember, we're not talking about racial movement.

520
00:17:03.089 --> 00:17:05.713
People (mumbling), "What about the races and all?"

521
00:17:05.713 --> 00:17:07.590
Where did you ever get that?

522
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:08.988
I never talked anything about race.

523
00:17:08.988 --> 00:17:11.494
I talked about the elements of civilization

524
00:17:11.494 --> 00:17:13.841
which are completely separate from the question of races.

525
00:17:13.841 --> 00:17:16.806
This is not a racial matter, racial superiority.

526
00:17:16.806 --> 00:17:19.622
And when we get into the analysis for the word Arian

527
00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:20.827
we must hit on this.
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

528
00:17:20.827 --> 00:17:21.339
I have that

529
00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:22.821
on the top of the list here
<v Michael>Because that's a</v>

530
00:17:22.821 --> 00:17:24.283
huge, you know, and again, we'll find out why

531
00:17:24.283 --> 00:17:26.373
that's been so misappropriated.

532
00:17:26.373 --> 00:17:28.997
So the elements of civilization is basket weaving,

533
00:17:28.997 --> 00:17:31.695
mathematical concepts and music, you know,

534
00:17:31.695 --> 00:17:34.833
design, hair braiding.

535
00:17:34.833 --> 00:17:36.625
They found them in the Tarim basins.

536
00:17:36.625 --> 00:17:39.483
The only place you find those braids is in Denmark.

537
00:17:39.483 --> 00:17:41.200
Explain it if you can, right?

538
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.003
The coloring of the hair, the using of the lime,

539
00:17:43.003 --> 00:17:45.904
the tartan, the horses, the burials, the positioning,

540
00:17:45.904 --> 00:17:47.738
the mound features.

541
00:17:47.738 --> 00:17:49.573
It's Western, you can either accept it or you can't.

542
00:17:49.573 --> 00:17:51.248
We're not trying to ram it down anybody's throats.

543
00:17:51.248 --> 00:17:53.967
It's a fact and the anthropologists know it.

544
00:17:53.967 --> 00:17:56.239
But upstairs says don't publish it.

545
00:17:56.239 --> 00:17:57.338
You're not gonna talk about it.

546
00:17:57.338 --> 00:17:58.820
Come up with some other bogus explanation

547
00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.303
etcetera.
<v Voiceover>So why?</v>

548
00:18:00.303 --> 00:18:03.620
<v ->Well, because remember you're dealing with,</v>

549
00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:07.268
well let's cut to the chase with that then.

550
00:18:07.268 --> 00:18:08.964
Anyone watching this who is absolutely convinced

551
00:18:08.964 --> 00:18:11.012
that there is a world,

552
00:18:11.012 --> 00:18:12.281
architecture of control, right,

553
00:18:12.281 --> 00:18:14.766
and is lamenting it and looking to understand

554
00:18:14.766 --> 00:18:16.995
why it rolls, must understand this next point

555
00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:20.995
very, very, they must listen with all their mind

556
00:18:20.995 --> 00:18:22.499
to this next point.

557
00:18:22.499 --> 00:18:26.264
None of that architecture of tyranny,

558
00:18:26.264 --> 00:18:29.485
none of the genecidal psychopathy

559
00:18:29.485 --> 00:18:33.000
or any of that poison that the black lodge

560
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.497
has created down through the centuries could exist,

561
00:18:35.497 --> 00:18:36.542
none of it

562
00:18:36.542 --> 00:18:38.729
if the original people that I address,

563
00:18:38.729 --> 00:18:43.295
namely the Maggi, the Elders the Druids, existed.

564
00:18:43.295 --> 00:18:45.183
This brings up two points.

565
00:18:45.183 --> 00:18:47.671
One is that all these lodges, Masonic lodges,

566
00:18:47.671 --> 00:18:49.250
(mumbling) lodges and all the rest of it,

567
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.810
all the elites today, everything they had

568
00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:54.242
is a cannibalization and a plagarization

569
00:18:54.242 --> 00:18:55.639
of those Elders.

570
00:18:55.639 --> 00:18:57.079
That's one, number one.

571
00:18:57.079 --> 00:19:00.890
And two, had those Elders still been allowed to exist,

572
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.512
the other could not exist.

573
00:19:02.512 --> 00:19:05.499
Because that school of light, that college of light

574
00:19:05.499 --> 00:19:08.512
was vigilant to this pestilence.

575
00:19:08.512 --> 00:19:09.215
They had rights.

576
00:19:09.215 --> 00:19:10.303
They had Shamanic rights.

577
00:19:10.303 --> 00:19:11.179
They had the Wicca, right.

578
00:19:11.179 --> 00:19:14.827
They had the whole Shamanic matrix

579
00:19:14.827 --> 00:19:17.963
to make sure that a certain child ain't going anywhere

580
00:19:17.963 --> 00:19:19.979
if they're toxic.

581
00:19:19.979 --> 00:19:22.283
To the point that they'd even, as we know,

582
00:19:22.283 --> 00:19:24.437
leave them out to die.

583
00:19:24.437 --> 00:19:26.410
That's been overly exaggerated, of course,

584
00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:28.437
but the idea was okay, if nature has created

585
00:19:28.437 --> 00:19:30.709
some rotten fruit, rotten fruit grows on a tree.

586
00:19:30.709 --> 00:19:33.194
It's quite natural to let that rotten fruit fall and die

587
00:19:33.194 --> 00:19:35.978
and perish so it doesn't destroy the whole crop or whatever.

588
00:19:35.978 --> 00:19:38.772
And these Druids, these Elders, these Matriarchs understood

589
00:19:38.772 --> 00:19:39.785
that this is also a law.

590
00:19:39.785 --> 00:19:42.623
There is a catabolic force that you must honor also.

591
00:19:42.623 --> 00:19:44.948
And therefore, by not letting the creme,

592
00:19:44.948 --> 00:19:46.473
by not letting the scum rise to the top,

593
00:19:46.473 --> 00:19:49.566
as these fraternities now not only permit but--

594
00:19:49.566 --> 00:19:50.121
<v Voiceover>Promote.</v>

595
00:19:50.121 --> 00:19:51.326
<v ->Promote, right?</v>

596
00:19:51.326 --> 00:19:52.073
They did the opposite.

597
00:19:52.073 --> 00:19:53.438
The Druidic colleges did the opposite.

598
00:19:53.438 --> 00:19:55.155
They made sure that the scum stayed

599
00:19:55.155 --> 00:19:57.086
cleaning the floors and doing whatever they needed to do

600
00:19:57.086 --> 00:19:59.710
and that only the pure rose to the top.

601
00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.056
So when these people bash Plato and bash the philosopher

602
00:20:02.056 --> 00:20:04.243
kings, you know, they're coming from a very, very limited

603
00:20:04.243 --> 00:20:05.138
state of understanding.

604
00:20:05.138 --> 00:20:07.837
The original principal of Plato and his philosopher kings

605
00:20:07.837 --> 00:20:10.322
was not totalitarian control as Fabian left-wing

606
00:20:10.322 --> 00:20:12.765
people in the universities are trying to tell you that

607
00:20:12.765 --> 00:20:15.101
when we ask who's teaching Plato.

608
00:20:15.101 --> 00:20:16.914
You know, if we wanted to get into that.

609
00:20:16.914 --> 00:20:18.610
But the point is that none of these platonic people

610
00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.628
were pushing any type of totalitarian new world order.

611
00:20:21.628 --> 00:20:23.505
What they were showing you is if the man

612
00:20:23.505 --> 00:20:27.014
who has his inner republic and harmony, he can rule.

613
00:20:27.014 --> 00:20:28.476
He will not be a tyrant because he doesn't,

614
00:20:28.476 --> 00:20:30.289
he's not working with tyranny.

615
00:20:30.289 --> 00:20:32.497
In fact, his job is to filtrate tyranny.

616
00:20:32.497 --> 00:20:35.121
He's the meter for your tyranny.

617
00:20:35.121 --> 00:20:37.402
The very people who are bashing this concept,

618
00:20:37.402 --> 00:20:40.276
what, you're supporting the world we have now then?

619
00:20:40.276 --> 00:20:41.200
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

620
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.106
<v ->Could it be any worse?</v>

621
00:20:42.106 --> 00:20:43.876
<v Voiceover>Which is the antithesis of that--</v>

622
00:20:43.876 --> 00:20:45.892
<v ->It's the antithesis of it, right.</v>

623
00:20:45.892 --> 00:20:48.025
So anyway, back to the main point, the thing is that

624
00:20:48.025 --> 00:20:50.052
so the new order, the black lodge,

625
00:20:50.052 --> 00:20:52.793
that's subsequently, in Ireland's history

626
00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:55.115
it's about 500 B.C. that the problems began.

627
00:20:57.155 --> 00:20:59.938
That group that now builded, has built the universities,

628
00:20:59.938 --> 00:21:02.604
has created the literature, who funds the intellectuals

629
00:21:02.604 --> 00:21:05.580
and funds the histories,

630
00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.524
this whole organism, this whole pathogen

631
00:21:08.524 --> 00:21:11.681
could simply not exist if the other existed.

632
00:21:11.681 --> 00:21:13.772
And I don't care if it's the Indian Aryan version,

633
00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:16.609
the Chaldean version, the Samarian version,

634
00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:19.233
you know, the (mumbling)-Keltic

635
00:21:19.233 --> 00:21:20.438
and then the Gaelic,

636
00:21:20.438 --> 00:21:23.318
wherever the mystery school teachers were.

637
00:21:23.318 --> 00:21:26.027
As long as they existed, there's no chance

638
00:21:26.027 --> 00:21:29.771
for this reprobate version to exist.

639
00:21:29.771 --> 00:21:31.468
That is why, that is the ultimate reason

640
00:21:31.468 --> 00:21:33.164
for the campaign of genocide.

641
00:21:33.164 --> 00:21:34.465
I dealt with a campaign of genocide

642
00:21:34.465 --> 00:21:36.887
in a slightly different context in the Atlantis book,

643
00:21:36.887 --> 00:21:38.604
you know, which also dealt with the Irish thing.

644
00:21:38.604 --> 00:21:40.972
It's developed much more in the Irish Origins book.

645
00:21:40.972 --> 00:21:42.102
But there's a reason for it.

646
00:21:42.102 --> 00:21:45.355
And then secondly, you may destroy the root,

647
00:21:45.355 --> 00:21:47.681
but that doesn't mean you haven't abused the fruit.

648
00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:48.513
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

649
00:21:48.513 --> 00:21:50.507
<v ->So just, they all had their baskets ready</v>

650
00:21:50.507 --> 00:21:53.558
for the teachings, the principles, the astrology,

651
00:21:53.558 --> 00:21:56.661
the astro theology, the astronomy.

652
00:21:56.661 --> 00:21:59.402
All of these principles that was garnered

653
00:21:59.402 --> 00:22:00.960
over thousands of centuries.

654
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.677
In other words, the building of the stone megaliths,

655
00:22:02.677 --> 00:22:03.926
how they could align that, you know,

656
00:22:03.926 --> 00:22:05.088
everyone knows, "How did they do it."

657
00:22:05.088 --> 00:22:07.637
You know, where did the (mumbling) stages come

658
00:22:07.637 --> 00:22:10.101
for these mathematical concepts or these great tools

659
00:22:10.101 --> 00:22:11.936
or the building of the pyramid?

660
00:22:11.936 --> 00:22:13.909
They're trying to tell you from out of nowhere?

661
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:16.095
This was the fact that our earth civilizations

662
00:22:16.095 --> 00:22:16.885
existed longer.

663
00:22:16.885 --> 00:22:17.994
The proof is right there.

664
00:22:17.994 --> 00:22:19.317
I don't know why it's taking people so long

665
00:22:19.317 --> 00:22:20.799
to understand this.

666
00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:23.124
You know, even a school child can't just do calculus

667
00:22:23.124 --> 00:22:24.170
right away.

668
00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:26.303
There's a antecedent steps.

669
00:22:26.303 --> 00:22:28.703
Cannot be any different with a civilization.

670
00:22:28.703 --> 00:22:31.390
So the idea is that there's being

671
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:34.601
a whole side genocide of those people.

672
00:22:34.601 --> 00:22:35.806
The people who studied the witch hunts

673
00:22:35.806 --> 00:22:38.686
of the dark ages understand exactly what I'm saying.

674
00:22:38.686 --> 00:22:40.425
I'm not saying anything different

675
00:22:40.425 --> 00:22:41.534
than what happened to the Huguenots,

676
00:22:41.534 --> 00:22:43.368
what happened to the Wicca,

677
00:22:43.368 --> 00:22:45.768
what's happened to, you know, many races

678
00:22:45.768 --> 00:22:49.501
throughout even recent periods.

679
00:22:49.501 --> 00:22:51.272
Except what, you know my concentrating on ancient,

680
00:22:51.272 --> 00:22:52.264
ancient history.

681
00:22:52.264 --> 00:22:54.173
And of equal or secondary importance

682
00:22:54.173 --> 00:22:57.117
is the fact of the cannibalization or their (mumbling)

683
00:22:57.117 --> 00:23:00.967
and that's where the elements of our civilization

684
00:23:00.967 --> 00:23:03.900
now appear, the architectural motifs,

685
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.966
the design of cities.

686
00:23:06.846 --> 00:23:07.966
The symbolism of all of the above.

687
00:23:07.966 --> 00:23:10.174
<v Voiceover>Done with no carrying none of the wisdom</v>

688
00:23:10.174 --> 00:23:12.329
or knowledge forth with it.

689
00:23:12.329 --> 00:23:14.238
<v ->No, it's a cannibalization of that</v>

690
00:23:14.238 --> 00:23:16.670
and so this is then rebounds back to the question

691
00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:18.600
of those who are maybe getting into a little critiquing

692
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.797
of this.

693
00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:23.471
They are critiquing.

694
00:23:23.471 --> 00:23:25.582
If you don't like a piano player's rendition

695
00:23:25.582 --> 00:23:28.740
of a piece of Chopin, don't blame Chopin.

696
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.457
If you don't like what Edward Bernays did,

697
00:23:30.457 --> 00:23:32.409
don't blame Freud.

698
00:23:32.409 --> 00:23:34.019
If you don't like what Annie Besant did,

699
00:23:34.019 --> 00:23:35.754
don't blame Blavatsky.

700
00:23:36.902 --> 00:23:38.543
It makes me cry

701
00:23:38.543 --> 00:23:40.869
that we have this kind of low level of intelligence.

702
00:23:40.869 --> 00:23:43.908
Right, at this point because the research isn't there.

703
00:23:43.908 --> 00:23:46.532
What we have today is the cannibalization

704
00:23:46.532 --> 00:23:48.932
of all these ancient traditions.

705
00:23:48.932 --> 00:23:49.945
Don't blame the Druids.

706
00:23:49.945 --> 00:23:51.300
Don't blame the man who created that

707
00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.786
for the good of all humanity, alright.

708
00:23:53.786 --> 00:23:55.877
Blame those who've cannibalized it.

709
00:23:55.877 --> 00:23:57.477
A lot of these (mumbling) were done for reasons.

710
00:23:57.477 --> 00:23:59.034
The Druids would do it for reasons, you know,

711
00:23:59.034 --> 00:24:00.954
why certain megaliths were put here.

712
00:24:00.954 --> 00:24:02.949
Why certain structures were put there.

713
00:24:02.949 --> 00:24:05.466
There was also a healing of the earth going on.

714
00:24:05.466 --> 00:24:06.948
It really helps to remember

715
00:24:06.948 --> 00:24:08.623
that the application is very important.

716
00:24:08.623 --> 00:24:09.892
There's two forms of application

717
00:24:09.892 --> 00:24:10.735
of this nosis.

718
00:24:10.735 --> 00:24:13.561
There's the application of the purist who created it

719
00:24:13.561 --> 00:24:16.750
and then there's the subverse of, or subverted, you know,

720
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.321
use application of the later black lodge.

721
00:24:19.321 --> 00:24:20.995
<v Voiceover>And that's very powerful,</v>

722
00:24:20.995 --> 00:24:23.203
to have something that can be misconstrued

723
00:24:23.203 --> 00:24:25.198
and then passed on as truth

724
00:24:25.198 --> 00:24:28.515
when it has some essential beauty and truth in it

725
00:24:28.515 --> 00:24:31.256
is easy to sell.

726
00:24:31.256 --> 00:24:33.187
<v ->But do you see that it's because it has beauty in it</v>

727
00:24:33.187 --> 00:24:34.968
that it's subconsciously attractive to most people

728
00:24:34.968 --> 00:24:35.715
even today?
<v Voiceover>Absolutely,</v>

729
00:24:35.715 --> 00:24:36.429
that's what I'm saying.

730
00:24:36.429 --> 00:24:38.552
Because it has those constituents,

731
00:24:38.552 --> 00:24:40.525
people will buy it.

732
00:24:40.525 --> 00:24:41.751
So I can see the problem.

733
00:24:41.751 --> 00:24:43.607
If you have that amount of beauty and truth

734
00:24:43.607 --> 00:24:45.954
embedded in something that has been co-opted

735
00:24:45.954 --> 00:24:48.652
for perhaps even a reverse purpose,

736
00:24:48.652 --> 00:24:50.807
you know, a purpose antithetical to that,

737
00:24:50.807 --> 00:24:52.407
how are we to feel the difference

738
00:24:52.407 --> 00:24:55.777
when we're essentially connecting with that original

739
00:24:55.777 --> 00:24:57.121
truth and beauty?

740
00:24:57.121 --> 00:25:01.654
I mean, the possibility for disinformation, misinformation

741
00:25:01.654 --> 00:25:04.043
and misalignment is unbelievable.

742
00:25:04.043 --> 00:25:06.593
How are we to know the truth anymore?

743
00:25:06.593 --> 00:25:07.659
<v ->Well, let's take the same point</v>

744
00:25:07.659 --> 00:25:08.875
up to the metaphysical level.

745
00:25:08.875 --> 00:25:10.262
What is evil?

746
00:25:10.262 --> 00:25:12.256
Evil does not have anything of its own.

747
00:25:12.256 --> 00:25:13.888
It's negation.

748
00:25:13.888 --> 00:25:16.853
Evil only exists or (mumbling)

749
00:25:16.853 --> 00:25:18.412
is the violation of something that was originally

750
00:25:18.412 --> 00:25:21.388
good or positive or wholesome or holistic.

751
00:25:21.388 --> 00:25:24.503
If it can subvert, skew, change, morph, you know,

752
00:25:24.503 --> 00:25:26.877
modify, somewhat contaminate or corrupt

753
00:25:26.877 --> 00:25:27.894
that which is positive,

754
00:25:27.894 --> 00:25:29.839
then you have a definition of evil.

755
00:25:29.839 --> 00:25:31.983
That's what, of it's own it has no power at all.

756
00:25:31.983 --> 00:25:35.236
This connects a lot with the root of my optimism

757
00:25:35.236 --> 00:25:37.882
is because evil by its very definition

758
00:25:37.882 --> 00:25:39.897
is telling nature come and get me.

759
00:25:39.897 --> 00:25:42.340
Anything that lives in violation of nature's ordinances

760
00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.537
is raising a red flag going, I shouldn't exist.

761
00:25:44.537 --> 00:25:46.233
And nature, in its own sweet time, will take care of it.

762
00:25:46.233 --> 00:25:49.209
So you know, like people who get really pessimistic

763
00:25:49.209 --> 00:25:51.107
and down about what's going on,

764
00:25:51.107 --> 00:25:52.665
my message to them is don't you see

765
00:25:52.665 --> 00:25:56.355
that evil has within it the seed of its own destruction?

766
00:25:56.355 --> 00:25:58.008
Now people who have read the last chapter

767
00:25:58.008 --> 00:26:00.376
of my Atlantis book know that I've already gone into this,

768
00:26:00.376 --> 00:26:02.115
but it needs to be repeated time and time again.

769
00:26:02.115 --> 00:26:02.723
<v Voiceover>Repeat it.</v>

770
00:26:02.723 --> 00:26:05.016
<v ->Evil is, contains within it the seed</v>

771
00:26:05.016 --> 00:26:06.434
of its own annihilation.

772
00:26:06.434 --> 00:26:08.920
It is not something that is sustainable.

773
00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.040
Even though, you know, we may--

774
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.663
<v Voiceover>Because it's going against all principles</v>

775
00:26:12.663 --> 00:26:13.751
and nature of life.

776
00:26:13.751 --> 00:26:15.938
<v ->Right, and nature's in perfect order, perfect balance.</v>

777
00:26:15.938 --> 00:26:17.463
The Egyptians always showed that as the feather

778
00:26:17.463 --> 00:26:19.746
of the goddess (mumbling) and the great scale of life.

779
00:26:19.746 --> 00:26:21.761
Right, it's incredible metaphor.

780
00:26:21.761 --> 00:26:24.737
And other cultures have used various metaphors

781
00:26:24.737 --> 00:26:27.681
for this homeostasis or this balance or this equilibrium.

782
00:26:27.681 --> 00:26:30.006
And this order is invalid.

783
00:26:30.006 --> 00:26:31.702
In fact, some of the Shamanic groups talk about

784
00:26:31.702 --> 00:26:35.254
the fact that man's probing into, you know,

785
00:26:35.254 --> 00:26:38.358
the subatomic as he's probing into the physical.

786
00:26:38.358 --> 00:26:41.472
His insecurity, he needs to control mother nature.

787
00:26:41.472 --> 00:26:42.635
He needs to oppress it.

788
00:26:42.635 --> 00:26:44.117
He needs to organize it, you know.

789
00:26:44.117 --> 00:26:46.603
He needs to understand it, dissect it, you know.

790
00:26:46.603 --> 00:26:48.693
Lenard Shlain, who sadly passed away recently,

791
00:26:48.693 --> 00:26:50.570
wrote Alphabet Verses the Goddess

792
00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:51.872
and Art and Physics.

793
00:26:51.872 --> 00:26:54.133
These great books that meditate on thse ideas

794
00:26:54.133 --> 00:26:56.821
about what is this phallic or ithyphallic,

795
00:26:56.821 --> 00:26:58.612
you know, need to dissect, you know,

796
00:26:58.612 --> 00:27:00.490
the old (mumbling) paradigm.

797
00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:03.092
This is because man, this kind of thinking,

798
00:27:03.092 --> 00:27:06.740
this yang modality, this inquisitive masculine mindset

799
00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:10.036
is insecure and it cannot turn itself on

800
00:27:10.036 --> 00:27:12.681
to understanding what that miracle of life is all about.

801
00:27:12.681 --> 00:27:15.859
In other words, just like people like Ken Wilbur

802
00:27:15.859 --> 00:27:18.782
have examined and even, you know, Michael Talbot

803
00:27:18.782 --> 00:27:20.968
and The Holographic Universe paradigm.

804
00:27:20.968 --> 00:27:23.454
The psychopath cannot see holarchy,

805
00:27:23.454 --> 00:27:25.864
not even if you pointed it out to him.

806
00:27:25.864 --> 00:27:27.517
They'll go, "But it's hierarchy."

807
00:27:27.517 --> 00:27:28.445
No, it's holarchy.

808
00:27:28.445 --> 00:27:30.973
"No, no, no it's hierarchy, look, can't you see?"

809
00:27:30.973 --> 00:27:32.744
So it's like some sort of twilight zone situation

810
00:27:32.744 --> 00:27:34.068
and which even if it's in front of them,

811
00:27:34.068 --> 00:27:35.966
they're not seeing what you're seeing.

812
00:27:35.966 --> 00:27:37.854
And in fact, I've even gone so far as to say

813
00:27:37.854 --> 00:27:41.128
it's a definition of psychopathy is hierarchy.

814
00:27:41.128 --> 00:27:43.539
So all the structures that the brotherhood,

815
00:27:43.539 --> 00:27:46.440
the dark lodge create, are hierarchical

816
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.787
because they're based on psychopathy.

817
00:27:48.787 --> 00:27:51.645
Now The Architects of Control, dvd series that we're doing

818
00:27:51.645 --> 00:27:53.842
is an examination of what that is.

819
00:27:53.842 --> 00:27:54.888
It's not bashing technology.

820
00:27:54.888 --> 00:27:57.351
It's saying, hey, you know, what is technology

821
00:27:57.351 --> 00:27:59.421
in the hands of a psychopath?

822
00:27:59.421 --> 00:27:59.933
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

823
00:27:59.933 --> 00:28:01.545
<v ->Reminds me of this old, you know,</v>

824
00:28:03.325 --> 00:28:05.097
Charles Bronson movie, Death Wish, you know,

825
00:28:05.097 --> 00:28:06.747
where he goes, "I ain't got a problem with guy,

826
00:28:06.747 --> 00:28:08.464
"I haven't got a problem with guns.

827
00:28:08.464 --> 00:28:10.000
"I got a problem with a lunatic with a gun."

828
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.141
<v Voiceover>(laughing) Exactly.</v>

829
00:28:11.141 --> 00:28:12.133
<v ->That worries me.</v>

830
00:28:12.133 --> 00:28:13.573
That's the point, right.

831
00:28:13.573 --> 00:28:15.525
So technology's helping us, it's great.

832
00:28:15.525 --> 00:28:17.061
Look at the wonderful things, you know.

833
00:28:17.061 --> 00:28:18.010
To be able to fly around the world

834
00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:19.408
and communicate and the cameras

835
00:28:19.408 --> 00:28:21.519
and all of this kind of thing, nothing wrong with it,

836
00:28:21.519 --> 00:28:24.655
but that powerful, wonderful, you know,

837
00:28:24.655 --> 00:28:27.968
creation in the hands of people who are demented.

838
00:28:29.062 --> 00:28:30.641
In a Freudian way, in a Jungian way,

839
00:28:30.641 --> 00:28:32.273
whatever way you wanna talk about it,

840
00:28:32.273 --> 00:28:33.617
who are really fragmented

841
00:28:33.617 --> 00:28:35.474
and from a Christian point of view,

842
00:28:35.474 --> 00:28:36.892
could say they're possessed

843
00:28:36.892 --> 00:28:39.239
or infected with something, a dark sorcery.

844
00:28:39.239 --> 00:28:40.444
You know, in my work, I talk about the difference

845
00:28:40.444 --> 00:28:42.396
between sorcery and magic.

846
00:28:42.396 --> 00:28:44.902
The magician is the one who can walk through all the hell

847
00:28:44.902 --> 00:28:46.694
and walk through all the pain and the suffering

848
00:28:46.694 --> 00:28:49.339
and walk through the fire and still come out centered.

849
00:28:49.339 --> 00:28:51.057
The sorcerer is the one who takes the same journey,

850
00:28:51.057 --> 00:28:53.147
but he gets seduced.

851
00:28:53.147 --> 00:28:54.886
<v Voiceover>And sadly, the two have been thrown together</v>

852
00:28:54.886 --> 00:28:56.400
in the same pot.

853
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.160
<v ->Again, we're back to this whole etymology thing.</v>

854
00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.365
We're back to this blame game.

855
00:28:59.365 --> 00:29:02.533
We're back to this, you know, it reminds me

856
00:29:02.533 --> 00:29:06.757
of the old Alexander Pope, you know, lines.

857
00:29:06.757 --> 00:29:09.050
"Drink it or touch it not, the Pierian Spring,

858
00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:11.237
"A little knowledge is a dangerous thing."

859
00:29:11.237 --> 00:29:14.276
That might end up being one of the most profound,

860
00:29:14.276 --> 00:29:15.759
you know, statements ever.

861
00:29:15.759 --> 00:29:17.199
There are actually some more profound,

862
00:29:17.199 --> 00:29:19.034
but that one is high up when you really start

863
00:29:19.034 --> 00:29:19.897
to contemplate it.

864
00:29:19.897 --> 00:29:22.383
<v Voiceover>Yes. So it seems to me</v>

865
00:29:22.383 --> 00:29:23.375
it helps to jump back a bit

866
00:29:23.375 --> 00:29:25.604
because as I was reading Irish Origins,

867
00:29:25.604 --> 00:29:27.257
you're getting back to, again,

868
00:29:27.257 --> 00:29:29.550
these architects of control and you are going back

869
00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:31.833
into the Atlantean period of time,

870
00:29:31.833 --> 00:29:33.411
even the Lamerian period of time.

871
00:29:33.411 --> 00:29:35.523
And you're saying, from what I understand,

872
00:29:35.523 --> 00:29:37.262
tell me if this is what you're saying,

873
00:29:37.262 --> 00:29:39.790
that these advance civilizations

874
00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:41.816
and the knowledge that they possessed

875
00:29:41.816 --> 00:29:44.952
and that was seeded throughout the countries,

876
00:29:44.952 --> 00:29:48.088
I mean we're talking even into the Americas and so forth,

877
00:29:48.088 --> 00:29:51.106
had its origins from the Atlantean period of time.

878
00:29:51.106 --> 00:29:52.631
Right? But this is also where you're saying

879
00:29:52.631 --> 00:29:54.605
the corruption occurred, right?

880
00:29:54.605 --> 00:29:55.447
<v ->Yeah, absolutely--</v>

881
00:29:55.447 --> 00:29:57.623
<v Voiceover>Can you talk about that a little bit,</v>

882
00:29:57.623 --> 00:30:00.386
that corruption and how did this seeding happen

883
00:30:00.386 --> 00:30:05.196
into Ireland, into Egypt, into some of the Americas as well.

884
00:30:05.196 --> 00:30:07.852
There was very advance knowledge in all these places

885
00:30:07.852 --> 00:30:10.422
and, as you show, common etymology.

886
00:30:10.422 --> 00:30:11.916
The word sources and Gaelic

887
00:30:11.916 --> 00:30:13.238
and Algonquin.
<v Michael>Yeah, that's true.</v>

888
00:30:13.238 --> 00:30:15.702
<v Voiceover>It's amazing when I saw that chart</v>

889
00:30:15.702 --> 00:30:16.417
that you put up.

890
00:30:16.417 --> 00:30:17.995
<v ->Yeah, that research still goes on.</v>

891
00:30:17.995 --> 00:30:18.486
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

892
00:30:18.486 --> 00:30:20.267
<v ->In fact, if people pick up,</v>

893
00:30:20.267 --> 00:30:21.600
'cause you were talking about Atlantis,

894
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.806
just go and pick it out, you know.

895
00:30:22.806 --> 00:30:24.683
It's a little pulp book, I refer to it

896
00:30:24.683 --> 00:30:26.795
by Charles Berlitz, the language expert.

897
00:30:26.795 --> 00:30:28.171
This is from the Berlitz family.

898
00:30:28.171 --> 00:30:30.090
He's the guy who basically started the language books.

899
00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:32.512
He was one of the leading authorities on Atlantis.

900
00:30:32.512 --> 00:30:33.461
And if you go and pick up his book

901
00:30:33.461 --> 00:30:34.805
called Atlantis the Eighth Continent,

902
00:30:34.805 --> 00:30:37.130
he goes into it even into equal depth

903
00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:39.658
into the etymology, showing the connections

904
00:30:39.658 --> 00:30:41.866
between not just American, Ireland,

905
00:30:41.866 --> 00:30:45.044
but all through the world, same cuneiform,

906
00:30:45.044 --> 00:30:47.967
the same, you know, phonograms and ideograms,

907
00:30:47.967 --> 00:30:50.292
right there, it's absolutely provable.

908
00:30:50.292 --> 00:30:51.988
You know, you take this all away to the idea

909
00:30:51.988 --> 00:30:53.780
that they're trying to bury this knowledge now.

910
00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.305
Like stones of the great megaliths

911
00:30:55.305 --> 00:30:58.163
or habitually turned around

912
00:30:58.163 --> 00:31:00.233
so that nobody can see the petroglyphs anymore.

913
00:31:00.233 --> 00:31:00.787
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

914
00:31:00.787 --> 00:31:02.483
<v ->Because those will show, not only that there's is astro</v>

915
00:31:02.483 --> 00:31:05.459
theology involved, but there's even, you know,

916
00:31:05.459 --> 00:31:08.243
incredible Druidic symbolism there, the ruins.

917
00:31:08.243 --> 00:31:09.800
So these will be defaced.

918
00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.123
These will be, you know, marred,

919
00:31:11.123 --> 00:31:12.882
because, again, this knowledge, they don't want,

920
00:31:12.882 --> 00:31:14.226
there's people that don't want this to get out

921
00:31:14.226 --> 00:31:15.698
so they can see these hidden connections.

922
00:31:15.698 --> 00:31:16.882
<v Voiceover>So what is the Atlantean knowledge</v>

923
00:31:16.882 --> 00:31:18.781
that was passed forward that's springing up now.

924
00:31:18.781 --> 00:31:19.645
I mean, there are a lot of fingers

925
00:31:19.645 --> 00:31:21.682
and a lot of dikes trying to keep things quiet.

926
00:31:21.682 --> 00:31:23.079
It's not working too well anymore.

927
00:31:23.079 --> 00:31:25.365
<v ->Well, the main thing that happened in Atlantis</v>

928
00:31:25.587 --> 00:31:26.745
is that

929
00:31:30.335 --> 00:31:32.043
if you look,

930
00:31:32.043 --> 00:31:35.766
the roots of all the idioms

931
00:31:35.766 --> 00:31:37.408
that you see today

932
00:31:37.408 --> 00:31:41.749
do go back before, you know, the official dates.

933
00:31:41.749 --> 00:31:43.637
So when we're talking about, we're really talking about

934
00:31:43.637 --> 00:31:45.996
what's called the Pre Diluvian or pre flood era

935
00:31:45.996 --> 00:31:48.055
and some people like to call it Atlantean Lamerian period

936
00:31:48.055 --> 00:31:49.985
and split hairs over that.

937
00:31:49.985 --> 00:31:52.278
The idea is that as it's been proven now

938
00:31:52.278 --> 00:31:54.998
by the artifacts and relics, there was civilizations

939
00:31:54.998 --> 00:31:56.715
that existed before ours.

940
00:31:56.715 --> 00:31:58.763
Obviously, they're not there anymore.

941
00:31:58.763 --> 00:32:00.342
So what happened to them, you know?

942
00:32:00.342 --> 00:32:01.686
This has become the great question.

943
00:32:01.686 --> 00:32:05.216
I connected, I turned to the legends of the world,

944
00:32:05.216 --> 00:32:07.520
especially the Irish legends as another person

945
00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:10.389
would turn to, you know, a fact book

946
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:11.861
or an encyclopedia.

947
00:32:11.861 --> 00:32:15.157
In my world, if it's in the Mythen legends,

948
00:32:15.157 --> 00:32:16.799
it's good to go.

949
00:32:16.799 --> 00:32:18.079
You know and people may critique me for that

950
00:32:18.079 --> 00:32:19.445
and think that's crazy.

951
00:32:19.445 --> 00:32:21.396
As far as I'm concerned and I'm very much coming

952
00:32:21.396 --> 00:32:23.050
from the Joseph Campbell school here, you know,

953
00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:26.164
and the Marcia Illiadin and this kind of school.

954
00:32:26.164 --> 00:32:28.297
I'm pretty much it's good to go.

955
00:32:28.297 --> 00:32:30.271
Doesn't mean it's not colored and flowered up

956
00:32:30.271 --> 00:32:31.988
in poetry, poetized.

957
00:32:31.988 --> 00:32:33.684
Doesn't mean that it hasn't been misinterpreted

958
00:32:33.684 --> 00:32:36.009
or potentially can be misinterpreted,

959
00:32:36.009 --> 00:32:37.076
especially Irish legends.

960
00:32:37.076 --> 00:32:38.281
My god, you gotta plow through a lot

961
00:32:38.281 --> 00:32:40.062
of fair folktale, you know, stuff there

962
00:32:40.062 --> 00:32:41.246
to get to the root of what's there,

963
00:32:41.246 --> 00:32:43.763
but when you do, same with the (mumbling) tradition--

964
00:32:43.763 --> 00:32:44.851
<v Voiceover>And you're seeing the same stories</v>

965
00:32:44.851 --> 00:32:46.131
pop up all over the planet.

966
00:32:46.131 --> 00:32:46.942
<v ->Right, this is fundamental.</v>

967
00:32:46.942 --> 00:32:48.680
<v Voiceover>In indigenous cultures, so...</v>

968
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.683
<v ->And I hope we can talk about that more.</v>

969
00:32:49.683 --> 00:32:51.027
That's totally fundamental.

970
00:32:51.027 --> 00:32:52.051
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

971
00:32:52.051 --> 00:32:54.877
<v ->Okay, so then something happened back then.</v>

972
00:32:54.877 --> 00:32:56.968
And in the ancient legends they're talking

973
00:32:56.968 --> 00:32:58.429
about couple of concepts.

974
00:32:58.429 --> 00:33:00.199
One is the great war of the gods,

975
00:33:00.199 --> 00:33:02.290
which is one of those, you know,

976
00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:04.775
(mumbling) myths that's everywhere.

977
00:33:04.775 --> 00:33:08.487
The cosmologies, that's something got created got destroyed.

978
00:33:08.487 --> 00:33:10.951
Often, like in the (mumbling) and then many

979
00:33:10.951 --> 00:33:13.404
of the Irish legends, they're indicating

980
00:33:13.404 --> 00:33:16.380
that there's something either alien, physically,

981
00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:20.262
extraterrestrial or spiritually off world.

982
00:33:20.262 --> 00:33:22.950
Spiritually, you know, different.

983
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:25.734
And it can be difficult to say

984
00:33:25.734 --> 00:33:27.782
which one it is and depending on what myths you're reading,

985
00:33:27.782 --> 00:33:29.382
but Zach (mumbling) is pretty convinced

986
00:33:29.382 --> 00:33:30.821
that when he read the Samarian,

987
00:33:30.821 --> 00:33:32.496
it's clearly extraterrestrial.

988
00:33:32.496 --> 00:33:33.797
I tend to agree with that.

989
00:33:33.797 --> 00:33:35.355
<v Voiceover>Well, if you look at some of the pictographs</v>

990
00:33:35.355 --> 00:33:37.466
and so forth, it would certainly indicate that.

991
00:33:37.466 --> 00:33:39.781
<v ->I think so and same with Eric (mumbling),</v>

992
00:33:39.781 --> 00:33:42.458
you know, I think so that there's a lot of stuff there,

993
00:33:42.458 --> 00:33:45.242
you know, to look into and needs to be take on board.

994
00:33:45.242 --> 00:33:47.844
Other people may go no, no I prefer something else

995
00:33:47.844 --> 00:33:50.628
that's more spiritual, either way, alright.

996
00:33:50.628 --> 00:33:53.113
So the thing is that I looked to those

997
00:33:53.113 --> 00:33:55.345
and then I started to look at this concept.

998
00:33:55.345 --> 00:33:57.532
Then you have the Immanuel Velikovsky, you know,

999
00:33:57.532 --> 00:33:58.833
connection who comes in and says,

1000
00:33:58.833 --> 00:34:01.382
and that war of the gods or some

1001
00:34:01.382 --> 00:34:04.124
was a metaphor for some cosmological thing

1002
00:34:04.124 --> 00:34:07.570
that took place like the interference of a comet.

1003
00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:09.650
Which he thought might have been part of Venus.

1004
00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:12.586
Others think it's a cometary body called Phaeton,

1005
00:34:12.586 --> 00:34:16.138
you see, that caused these calamities.

1006
00:34:16.138 --> 00:34:19.509
My interest in all of this is not that.

1007
00:34:19.509 --> 00:34:21.317
That's all very interesting.

1008
00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:24.438
But, in fact, I would say that even my interest

1009
00:34:24.438 --> 00:34:28.448
in ancient history is secondary

1010
00:34:28.448 --> 00:34:30.816
to the interest in what's going on today.

1011
00:34:30.816 --> 00:34:32.213
I'm not a historian actually, you know.

1012
00:34:32.213 --> 00:34:34.464
And in one way, you know,

1013
00:34:34.464 --> 00:34:36.138
even though I deal so much with ancient history,

1014
00:34:36.138 --> 00:34:37.855
it's not really my concern.

1015
00:34:37.855 --> 00:34:39.925
My concern is what's going on now.

1016
00:34:39.925 --> 00:34:41.706
And particularly what's going on now

1017
00:34:41.706 --> 00:34:42.655
in consciousness.

1018
00:34:42.655 --> 00:34:44.012
What is man?

1019
00:34:44.012 --> 00:34:45.942
Start here, start with what you've got.

1020
00:34:45.942 --> 00:34:48.513
How did the human creature become what he is today?

1021
00:34:48.513 --> 00:34:49.889
<v Voiceover>So is that almost requiring a need</v>

1022
00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:51.350
to back engineer the story?

1023
00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:54.272
<v ->Yes, that's the sum total of everything I do.</v>

1024
00:34:54.272 --> 00:34:55.574
That's my interest.

1025
00:34:55.574 --> 00:34:57.387
How did the human mind or the ego

1026
00:34:57.387 --> 00:34:58.475
come to into being?

1027
00:34:58.475 --> 00:35:00.288
You know, nobody's really touched on that.

1028
00:35:00.288 --> 00:35:02.613
The ones who have, again, steer away

1029
00:35:02.613 --> 00:35:04.469
for whatever reason, you know,

1030
00:35:04.469 --> 00:35:06.975
away from the path that I've chosen.

1031
00:35:06.975 --> 00:35:11.455
So to continue the point is that I've think

1032
00:35:11.455 --> 00:35:14.218
that something happened to the ego of man,

1033
00:35:14.218 --> 00:35:16.500
his consciousness, his psychology

1034
00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.932
that started about 10,000 years ago.

1035
00:35:18.932 --> 00:35:20.351
And then I had to decide in my work

1036
00:35:20.351 --> 00:35:22.622
whether it was just earth changes and cataclysms,

1037
00:35:22.622 --> 00:35:24.628
Is that it, is that all, is that the reason?

1038
00:35:24.628 --> 00:35:26.324
It's bad enough, you know,

1039
00:35:26.324 --> 00:35:29.193
including cometary celestial upheaval.

1040
00:35:29.193 --> 00:35:32.361
Is that it like Velikovsky and people are saying?

1041
00:35:32.361 --> 00:35:33.864
Was it as the myths are indicating,

1042
00:35:33.864 --> 00:35:36.930
some sort of spiritual war?

1043
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:38.421
See, I'm open to that.

1044
00:35:38.421 --> 00:35:40.512
I can imagine that that could've taken place

1045
00:35:40.512 --> 00:35:42.698
and I can handle that, I think.

1046
00:35:42.698 --> 00:35:45.557
If it did happen, was that it, you know?

1047
00:35:45.557 --> 00:35:46.709
Was there a sorcery thing going on?

1048
00:35:46.709 --> 00:35:47.573
Is there some--

1049
00:35:47.573 --> 00:35:49.109
<v Voiceover>Could it be multi-dimensional in nature?</v>

1050
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:50.356
<v ->Yes, exactly.
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

1051
00:35:50.356 --> 00:35:53.055
<v ->Or was it, as they say, a visitation?</v>

1052
00:35:53.055 --> 00:35:56.020
A pure, trauma caused by a visitation?

1053
00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.652
As I started looking at these matters more,

1054
00:35:57.652 --> 00:35:59.556
I discovered that it's basically all of them.

1055
00:36:00.554 --> 00:36:02.229
And then I tried to put it, you know,

1056
00:36:02.229 --> 00:36:04.159
in some sort of order in the Atlantis book

1057
00:36:04.159 --> 00:36:06.389
to talk about the-- not that I'm right, again,

1058
00:36:06.389 --> 00:36:07.178
you know or anything like that.

1059
00:36:07.178 --> 00:36:09.268
I'm just creating a story

1060
00:36:09.268 --> 00:36:11.722
based on all these collated facts.

1061
00:36:11.722 --> 00:36:14.399
I'm trying to summate, but what am I trying to summate?

1062
00:36:14.399 --> 00:36:16.649
I'm trying to summate something that's vast

1063
00:36:16.649 --> 00:36:17.204
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm.</v>

1064
00:36:17.204 --> 00:36:19.017
<v ->into 400 pages or a couple of chapters</v>

1065
00:36:19.017 --> 00:36:20.318
or what have you, you know what I mean?

1066
00:36:20.318 --> 00:36:22.825
So it became that sort of challenge as well.

1067
00:36:22.825 --> 00:36:25.331
So the way I presented it was that there was this off world

1068
00:36:25.331 --> 00:36:27.881
presence that came here and the trauma

1069
00:36:27.881 --> 00:36:32.410
that we're still reeling from was threefold.

1070
00:36:32.876 --> 00:36:35.595
First, there was the violation of the planet

1071
00:36:35.595 --> 00:36:37.404
by this off world presence.

1072
00:36:38.797 --> 00:36:41.495
Then there was the violation of man's biology

1073
00:36:41.495 --> 00:36:44.979
through their genetic hybridization transgenic experiments.

1074
00:36:46.425 --> 00:36:49.326
Third, there was the trauma that humankind suffered

1075
00:36:49.326 --> 00:36:53.411
from the war that erupted between these same gods,

1076
00:36:53.411 --> 00:36:55.578
so called gods, the parties.

1077
00:36:55.578 --> 00:36:57.807
So man's psyche as we know it

1078
00:36:57.807 --> 00:37:00.015
suffered basically three, maybe four

1079
00:37:00.015 --> 00:37:02.639
very, very severe traumas

1080
00:37:02.639 --> 00:37:04.730
that shattered the ego.

1081
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:06.351
In the same way that in William Blake's

1082
00:37:06.351 --> 00:37:09.647
(mumbling) sort of a god-like figure.

1083
00:37:09.647 --> 00:37:11.577
Blake describes him falling

1084
00:37:11.577 --> 00:37:13.038
from the heavenly world

1085
00:37:13.038 --> 00:37:15.956
into the material world and he splits into four parts.

1086
00:37:18.383 --> 00:37:19.663
I've always found that very striking

1087
00:37:19.663 --> 00:37:22.170
and in a way I can borrow that metaphor

1088
00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:24.793
to talk about how man's ego or man's consciousness,

1089
00:37:24.793 --> 00:37:28.388
more correctly, shattered into four or five parts,

1090
00:37:28.388 --> 00:37:29.529
you see, like this.

1091
00:37:29.529 --> 00:37:31.897
And we're still trying to glue them back together.

1092
00:37:31.897 --> 00:37:34.862
<v Voiceover>But wasn't there also a forgetting process</v>

1093
00:37:34.862 --> 00:37:35.843
that occurred?

1094
00:37:35.843 --> 00:37:36.558
<v ->Yeah, the trauma.
<v Voiceover>There was</v>

1095
00:37:36.558 --> 00:37:37.998
vast knowledge from that trauma.

1096
00:37:37.998 --> 00:37:40.835
I mean, it's really about forgetting.

1097
00:37:40.835 --> 00:37:41.763
<v ->The amnesia.</v>

1098
00:37:41.763 --> 00:37:42.339
<v Voiceover>The amnesia.</v>

1099
00:37:42.339 --> 00:37:43.736
<v ->The historical amnesia that so many people</v>

1100
00:37:43.736 --> 00:37:44.707
have addressed.

1101
00:37:44.707 --> 00:37:47.661
<v Voiceover>It seems like that's the single largest factor</v>

1102
00:37:47.661 --> 00:37:49.378
facing mankind, is the amnesia.

1103
00:37:49.378 --> 00:37:52.770
We're just starting to awaken in what's happening.

1104
00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:56.599
<v ->And just like it's easy to take a very difficult thing</v>

1105
00:37:56.599 --> 00:37:58.751
and laugh about it and you'll accept it.

1106
00:37:59.621 --> 00:38:01.775
Man still wants to revisit that trauma,

1107
00:38:01.775 --> 00:38:04.357
but he does it through The Day After Tomorrow,

1108
00:38:04.357 --> 00:38:06.287
Blockbuster movie, right.
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

1109
00:38:06.287 --> 00:38:08.186
<v ->Charlton Heston and the Earthquake, you know?</v>

1110
00:38:08.186 --> 00:38:08.932
<v Voiceover>Because there's a remembrance</v>

1111
00:38:08.932 --> 00:38:10.649
and a resonance there, right?

1112
00:38:10.649 --> 00:38:13.412
<v ->Or even what was those preposterous films, you know,</v>

1113
00:38:13.412 --> 00:38:15.407
A Million Years B.C., or whatever, you know.

1114
00:38:15.407 --> 00:38:18.937
Whatever, the whole smorgasbord of those films

1115
00:38:18.937 --> 00:38:20.590
dealing with cataclysm and fighting monsters

1116
00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:22.307
and chucking spears at dinosaurs

1117
00:38:22.307 --> 00:38:24.323
and you know volcanoes run,

1118
00:38:24.323 --> 00:38:25.977
you know, what is all of that?

1119
00:38:25.977 --> 00:38:26.931
<v Voiceover>And The Day the Earth Stood Still.</v>

1120
00:38:26.931 --> 00:38:27.859
<v ->The Day the Earth Stood Still.</v>

1121
00:38:27.859 --> 00:38:29.256
All of the above, all of the above.

1122
00:38:29.256 --> 00:38:31.272
If you decode it, if you have what I call

1123
00:38:31.272 --> 00:38:33.299
the symbolic literacy, there it is.

1124
00:38:33.299 --> 00:38:36.616
You have to break it down into an acceptable form

1125
00:38:36.616 --> 00:38:38.269
that has a lot of little bells and whistles

1126
00:38:38.269 --> 00:38:40.360
along with it, you know, entertainment factors,

1127
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.471
to process it, Highlander.

1128
00:38:42.471 --> 00:38:43.207
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1129
00:38:43.207 --> 00:38:44.487
<v ->I mean the list is, let's not even get into it</v>

1130
00:38:44.487 --> 00:38:45.927
because the list goes on and on and on

1131
00:38:45.927 --> 00:38:48.530
of the movies that are pivotal, iconic, what have you.

1132
00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:50.268
That deal with this, you know?

1133
00:38:50.268 --> 00:38:52.060
Matrix, you know, you can update it

1134
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.543
and upgrade it in many different ways,

1135
00:38:53.543 --> 00:38:55.516
but the principle remains the same

1136
00:38:55.516 --> 00:38:58.929
that man is re-visiting this traumata.

1137
00:38:58.929 --> 00:39:01.062
But he's doing it in a way that is a little bit more safe

1138
00:39:01.062 --> 00:39:03.014
than handling it directly, you see?

1139
00:39:03.014 --> 00:39:04.550
To deal with what his ancestors went through

1140
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:05.734
because that's still too painful.

1141
00:39:05.734 --> 00:39:06.897
It's still too recent.

1142
00:39:06.897 --> 00:39:08.614
The wound is too important.

1143
00:39:08.614 --> 00:39:10.331
Now jump forward again, like I said,

1144
00:39:10.331 --> 00:39:11.931
my interest is now.

1145
00:39:11.931 --> 00:39:13.392
If that trauma existed,

1146
00:39:13.392 --> 00:39:15.813
could it be co-opted by the black lodge?

1147
00:39:15.813 --> 00:39:17.573
If they know that man is already

1148
00:39:17.573 --> 00:39:20.986
an anxious ridden, fragmented and traumatized individual,

1149
00:39:20.986 --> 00:39:22.981
you think they're not gonna make perfect use of that fact?

1150
00:39:22.981 --> 00:39:25.125
<v Voiceover>Absolutely, that's to a large degree</v>

1151
00:39:25.125 --> 00:39:27.322
what I feel has happened, is simply capitalized,

1152
00:39:27.322 --> 00:39:29.508
seizing the opportunity.

1153
00:39:29.508 --> 00:39:33.199
<v ->Their ancestors are responsible for the trauma</v>

1154
00:39:33.199 --> 00:39:35.545
in the first place and their descendants, again,

1155
00:39:35.545 --> 00:39:37.935
biological or ideological are--

1156
00:39:37.935 --> 00:39:39.983
<v Voiceover>And that's an important distinction to make.</v>

1157
00:39:39.983 --> 00:39:41.816
<v ->They're capitalizing on the continued trauma.</v>

1158
00:39:41.816 --> 00:39:43.225
In fact, even when there not enough trauma,

1159
00:39:43.225 --> 00:39:44.857
they'll do some rug pulling themselves

1160
00:39:44.857 --> 00:39:46.393
as they're doing right now.

1161
00:39:46.393 --> 00:39:47.939
Well the economy, oh this and that.

1162
00:39:47.939 --> 00:39:50.425
You don't know that this is by design yet?

1163
00:39:50.425 --> 00:39:53.123
<v Voiceover>This is all for the inducement of fear.</v>

1164
00:39:53.123 --> 00:39:54.798
<v ->Can you beat it into their heads?</v>

1165
00:39:54.798 --> 00:39:57.069
This is an multiple.

1166
00:39:57.069 --> 00:39:58.744
The wall goes up, now the wall's coming down.

1167
00:39:58.744 --> 00:40:00.152
The war's starting, now it's ending.

1168
00:40:00.152 --> 00:40:02.616
The economy's great, now it's not.

1169
00:40:02.616 --> 00:40:05.496
This president is wonderful, this guy, he's crazy.

1170
00:40:06.181 --> 00:40:08.141
When are we gonna realize what's going on here?

1171
00:40:08.141 --> 00:40:09.303
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1172
00:40:09.303 --> 00:40:11.532
<v ->Because they want to keep instilling this anxiety,</v>

1173
00:40:11.532 --> 00:40:13.250
this anxiety and until a person has what I call

1174
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:16.993
the psychic immunity and I address this in all the work,

1175
00:40:16.993 --> 00:40:19.937
you're going to be punched off all these walls.

1176
00:40:19.937 --> 00:40:21.964
Your head will literally be beaten off the walls

1177
00:40:21.964 --> 00:40:24.097
of the universe and you will then become

1178
00:40:24.097 --> 00:40:25.814
an infected person by this trauma

1179
00:40:25.814 --> 00:40:27.670
and you will infect others, your children,

1180
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:29.249
your neighbors, the guys at work.

1181
00:40:29.249 --> 00:40:30.433
You know, and they'll infect you

1182
00:40:30.433 --> 00:40:32.758
and before you know it, this is what we got.

1183
00:40:32.758 --> 00:40:34.688
We got Friday the 13th, part 14.

1184
00:40:34.688 --> 00:40:36.704
Here we go, the craziness, the chaos, you see.

1185
00:40:36.704 --> 00:40:37.515
And they're loving it.

1186
00:40:37.515 --> 00:40:38.773
The guys upstairs are just laughing

1187
00:40:38.773 --> 00:40:41.397
themselves silly over this.

1188
00:40:41.397 --> 00:40:43.808
How can they wheel out the same game.

1189
00:40:43.808 --> 00:40:45.013
You'd think they'd get tired of playing it.

1190
00:40:45.013 --> 00:40:46.528
You know, you can only play Monopoly so many times,

1191
00:40:46.528 --> 00:40:47.477
but these guys never get tired

1192
00:40:47.477 --> 00:40:49.898
because as Sidney Webb said himself,

1193
00:40:49.898 --> 00:40:53.354
it's an ever endless game of excitement.

1194
00:40:53.354 --> 00:40:53.962
The great game.

1195
00:40:53.962 --> 00:40:56.351
The head Fabians have said it's titillating.

1196
00:40:56.351 --> 00:40:58.559
Colonel Mandell House is on record

1197
00:40:58.559 --> 00:41:00.852
telling you it's wonderful.

1198
00:41:00.852 --> 00:41:03.924
And now they're working on the remote controlled creature

1199
00:41:03.924 --> 00:41:06.078
'cause the gun to the head, boot in the face,

1200
00:41:06.078 --> 00:41:07.540
eh, they've done that.

1201
00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:08.980
And they can still do it to some, you know,

1202
00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:10.121
rebellious Irish rogues, you know.

1203
00:41:10.121 --> 00:41:11.742
<v Voiceover>When you say remote controlled creature,</v>

1204
00:41:11.742 --> 00:41:13.374
are you talking about with the use and interface

1205
00:41:13.374 --> 00:41:14.089
of technology?

1206
00:41:14.089 --> 00:41:17.043
<v ->Yeah, surely, surely and even more subtle.</v>

1207
00:41:17.043 --> 00:41:18.846
<v Voiceover>Yeah, let's talk about that for a minute.</v>

1208
00:41:18.846 --> 00:41:19.475
<v ->Well--</v>

1209
00:41:19.475 --> 00:41:20.456
<v Voiceover>So what are some of the new games?</v>

1210
00:41:20.456 --> 00:41:22.941
Okay, we've done the boot to the head as you say.

1211
00:41:22.941 --> 00:41:25.497
What are the more subtle games that we can't see?

1212
00:41:26.527 --> 00:41:29.172
<v ->For instance, take the kind of propaganda machinery,</v>

1213
00:41:29.172 --> 00:41:31.159
right, the media,

1214
00:41:31.159 --> 00:41:33.113
which is a form of the war on consciousness,

1215
00:41:33.113 --> 00:41:35.129
a very important aspect of the war on consciousness.

1216
00:41:35.129 --> 00:41:35.619
<v Voiceover>Critical.</v>

1217
00:41:35.619 --> 00:41:37.678
<v ->Yeah, and let's take a classic example</v>

1218
00:41:37.678 --> 00:41:39.769
of how they're showing the cyborg creature,

1219
00:41:39.769 --> 00:41:41.486
the organic computer.

1220
00:41:41.486 --> 00:41:44.067
Half man or half woman cyborg individual.

1221
00:41:44.067 --> 00:41:44.952
They've been doing this for years,

1222
00:41:44.952 --> 00:41:47.576
but it's amping up now even in the commercials.

1223
00:41:47.576 --> 00:41:50.616
Let's take how they're portraying the global village

1224
00:41:50.616 --> 00:41:52.728
and you just can't wait for it, you know.

1225
00:41:52.728 --> 00:41:54.914
They are (mumbling) chips,

1226
00:41:54.914 --> 00:41:57.794
the surveillance, you know, to keep you safe.

1227
00:41:57.794 --> 00:41:59.181
On the other hand, they're showing you

1228
00:41:59.181 --> 00:42:01.271
the most frightening, you know, three headed monsters

1229
00:42:01.271 --> 00:42:03.319
rattling the gates of your security

1230
00:42:03.319 --> 00:42:04.738
to get you warmed up for this.

1231
00:42:04.738 --> 00:42:05.631
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1232
00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:09.250
<v ->Or they may even present, like for instance,</v>

1233
00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.287
one thing I noticed a lot is the way

1234
00:42:11.287 --> 00:42:12.940
that the male is presented

1235
00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:15.650
in not only commercials, the father figure, the male.

1236
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:18.529
This is a constantly manipulatable image,

1237
00:42:18.529 --> 00:42:20.065
as they all are, the portrayal of children,

1238
00:42:20.065 --> 00:42:21.132
the portrayal of women,

1239
00:42:21.132 --> 00:42:22.433
but just study the one thing,

1240
00:42:22.433 --> 00:42:24.637
the portrayal of the male architype.

1241
00:42:25.827 --> 00:42:27.757
First they're over exaggerating it

1242
00:42:27.757 --> 00:42:29.869
with the Rambo, Arnold Schwarzenegger,

1243
00:42:29.869 --> 00:42:32.183
you know raw hide tough guy, you know,

1244
00:42:32.183 --> 00:42:35.255
over sort of inflated Conan the Barbarian type.

1245
00:42:35.255 --> 00:42:38.967
You know? Is that because they want you to have one

1246
00:42:38.967 --> 00:42:41.100
sort of tweaked, skewed understanding of it

1247
00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:42.679
'cause they're ready with a second one,

1248
00:42:42.679 --> 00:42:45.559
the impotent, dweeby, dorky.

1249
00:42:45.559 --> 00:42:46.796
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm, powerless.</v>

1250
00:42:46.796 --> 00:42:48.812
<v ->Powerless individual, yeah.</v>

1251
00:42:48.812 --> 00:42:50.742
They're gonna, you know, watch what one hand is doing

1252
00:42:50.742 --> 00:42:52.502
as Archibald Wavell, the general said,

1253
00:42:52.502 --> 00:42:54.454
'cause they got something with the other hand coming in.

1254
00:42:54.454 --> 00:42:55.798
So you are, you're lookin' over here and thinkin'

1255
00:42:55.798 --> 00:42:57.771
oh that's a nice (mumbling) and identify with that.

1256
00:42:57.771 --> 00:42:59.072
You know, it's Clint, he's great.

1257
00:42:59.072 --> 00:43:00.960
Bring out the magnum and blow them all away.

1258
00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:01.771
Yeah, but what's happening

1259
00:43:01.771 --> 00:43:03.840
is who's coming over here with another one?

1260
00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.269
So this is going on and on and on.

1261
00:43:05.269 --> 00:43:06.069
That's one form of control--

1262
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:07.456
<v Voiceover>Keeps you in a state of total confusion</v>

1263
00:43:07.456 --> 00:43:08.523
as to your own personal identity--

1264
00:43:08.523 --> 00:43:10.709
<v ->This is what it's about, fragment your own identity,</v>

1265
00:43:10.709 --> 00:43:13.098
mess up the stereotypes and the archetypes

1266
00:43:13.098 --> 00:43:14.815
so nobody knows if they're coming or going.

1267
00:43:14.815 --> 00:43:18.026
We don't mind a little movement in that area.

1268
00:43:18.026 --> 00:43:19.690
But to completely subvert things, you see,

1269
00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:20.906
and they way that they're doing dramatically

1270
00:43:20.906 --> 00:43:21.898
is obviously off the wall.

1271
00:43:21.898 --> 00:43:23.039
It's very dangerous.

1272
00:43:23.039 --> 00:43:25.108
That's use through technology.

1273
00:43:25.108 --> 00:43:26.516
And then we have the more obvious ones,

1274
00:43:26.516 --> 00:43:28.031
which other people have dealt with excellently

1275
00:43:28.031 --> 00:43:29.673
about the, you know, the actual surveillance systems

1276
00:43:29.673 --> 00:43:31.305
and the F-I-R-D chips

1277
00:43:31.305 --> 00:43:33.118
and all of the scanning things that are going on.

1278
00:43:33.118 --> 00:43:35.646
Police amping up and all of that kind of thing

1279
00:43:35.646 --> 00:43:37.150
and satellites and all the rest of it.

1280
00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:38.451
You know, I don't get in to too much

1281
00:43:38.451 --> 00:43:39.614
of the individual stuff there.

1282
00:43:39.614 --> 00:43:41.310
I'm again looking at it in broad pictures

1283
00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:43.326
because I guess nobody can understand

1284
00:43:43.326 --> 00:43:44.883
any of the work that I do without understanding

1285
00:43:44.883 --> 00:43:48.019
that it's about examining the war on consciousness.

1286
00:43:48.019 --> 00:43:50.525
Every other idiom that you see

1287
00:43:50.525 --> 00:43:52.968
every other permutation that this great war takes

1288
00:43:52.968 --> 00:43:54.354
is to me satellite.

1289
00:43:54.354 --> 00:43:56.584
It is a symptom

1290
00:43:56.584 --> 00:43:59.207
of a more subtle war on the psyche,

1291
00:43:59.207 --> 00:44:00.818
on consciousness because if they can go

1292
00:44:00.818 --> 00:44:03.271
to the root, as they are, and if they can manipulate

1293
00:44:03.271 --> 00:44:05.831
then monopolize the trauma, the original trauma

1294
00:44:05.831 --> 00:44:07.527
that started in ancient times,

1295
00:44:07.527 --> 00:44:08.636
then you've got something.

1296
00:44:08.636 --> 00:44:10.823
Then you have the puppet, the potential,

1297
00:44:10.823 --> 00:44:13.446
you know, and all the way up to smiling depressive

1298
00:44:13.446 --> 00:44:15.953
of a global utopia, which is what's happening now.

1299
00:44:15.953 --> 00:44:17.201
And they're selling you that through Microsoft.

1300
00:44:17.201 --> 00:44:19.089
They're selling it through a lot of these Fabian left-wing

1301
00:44:19.089 --> 00:44:20.923
groups that are promising you such wonders

1302
00:44:20.923 --> 00:44:22.406
and global diversity and harmony.

1303
00:44:22.406 --> 00:44:23.728
<v Voiceover>They're selling it at your pharmacy.</v>

1304
00:44:23.728 --> 00:44:25.563
<v ->That's right, all over, all the symbolism</v>

1305
00:44:25.563 --> 00:44:26.512
and people are buying into it

1306
00:44:26.512 --> 00:44:27.696
and all of this kind of thing.

1307
00:44:27.696 --> 00:44:29.979
And we're still seeing the same solar cult symbolism

1308
00:44:29.979 --> 00:44:32.368
that Akhenaten was using, you know, how many years ago?

1309
00:44:32.368 --> 00:44:34.554
Thousands of years ago, 1400 B.C.

1310
00:44:34.554 --> 00:44:35.877
Nothing is changed as I said,

1311
00:44:35.877 --> 00:44:37.797
when you're dealing with an architecture, nothing's changed.

1312
00:44:37.797 --> 00:44:39.887
When you're dealing with the architects, well, that's just

1313
00:44:39.887 --> 00:44:42.309
replaceable test tubes in the experiment.

1314
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:43.418
But the building is still there,

1315
00:44:43.418 --> 00:44:44.858
the laboratory is one and the same.

1316
00:44:44.858 --> 00:44:46.852
Its still got Akhenaten's picture over the door, you know.

1317
00:44:46.852 --> 00:44:48.964
It's still the same temple.

1318
00:44:48.964 --> 00:44:50.265
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about Akhenaten.</v>

1319
00:44:50.265 --> 00:44:51.663
What happened there?

1320
00:44:51.663 --> 00:44:54.047
<v ->Okay, let's take that, if you go back</v>

1321
00:44:55.003 --> 00:44:56.837
and you keep tracing the symbolism

1322
00:44:56.837 --> 00:44:59.002
that we're using in the modern age

1323
00:44:59.002 --> 00:45:00.645
and you start going through all the things

1324
00:45:00.645 --> 00:45:01.455
that we've been talking about

1325
00:45:01.455 --> 00:45:03.823
about understanding who it is to blame.

1326
00:45:03.823 --> 00:45:05.557
Don't blame the purists.

1327
00:45:05.557 --> 00:45:08.079
Blame the corruptors and you really, really,

1328
00:45:08.079 --> 00:45:09.076
stick with that truth.

1329
00:45:09.076 --> 00:45:12.030
Then an interesting map opens up

1330
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:14.394
and it helps because you start finding out

1331
00:45:15.584 --> 00:45:18.464
that there were these East to West connections.

1332
00:45:18.464 --> 00:45:20.692
Remember when we talked about that?

1333
00:45:20.692 --> 00:45:22.847
Exacerbated by the fact that it was made easy

1334
00:45:22.847 --> 00:45:24.362
because there was land bridges.

1335
00:45:24.362 --> 00:45:25.589
That's not Michael Tsarion saying that.

1336
00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:27.188
That's Ulf Erlingsson saying that.

1337
00:45:27.188 --> 00:45:29.140
You can't get farther up the geological totem pole

1338
00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:30.207
than these guys.

1339
00:45:30.207 --> 00:45:32.436
They been (mumbling) photographs of the Sri Lanka one

1340
00:45:32.436 --> 00:45:34.345
from India to Sri Lanka from satellite.

1341
00:45:34.345 --> 00:45:35.945
Face it, they existed.

1342
00:45:35.945 --> 00:45:38.270
They existed between Scandinavian England

1343
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:40.361
and between Ireland and England.

1344
00:45:40.361 --> 00:45:42.537
Those countries did not look like they did,

1345
00:45:42.537 --> 00:45:43.774
you know, in ancient times, in fact,

1346
00:45:43.774 --> 00:45:45.278
none of the globe looked like it did

1347
00:45:45.278 --> 00:45:46.345
not even in recent times.

1348
00:45:46.345 --> 00:45:48.940
Recently in Ireland, they found sunken,

1349
00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:50.081
you now, coast lines.

1350
00:45:50.081 --> 00:45:52.076
Just now, just within the last six or nine months

1351
00:45:52.076 --> 00:45:55.350
they found sunken coast lines that defy explanation.

1352
00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:57.974
That they look like they went down in a catastrophe.

1353
00:45:57.974 --> 00:45:59.787
So this East to West movement is fundamental

1354
00:45:59.787 --> 00:46:01.984
to understanding what happened in Egypt.

1355
00:46:01.984 --> 00:46:03.499
Because once you understand that the elements

1356
00:46:03.499 --> 00:46:05.653
of civilization did originate from the West

1357
00:46:05.653 --> 00:46:06.976
and moved East and South

1358
00:46:06.976 --> 00:46:09.696
because of the age of cataclysm

1359
00:46:09.696 --> 00:46:11.349
and because of these land bridges,

1360
00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:13.344
slowly into your vision comes the idea

1361
00:46:13.344 --> 00:46:14.645
that wait a minute then,

1362
00:46:14.645 --> 00:46:17.546
these places are look very remote today.

1363
00:46:17.546 --> 00:46:19.029
For instances, Scotland, The Hebrides,

1364
00:46:19.029 --> 00:46:20.010
you know what I mean?

1365
00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:23.391
And Egypt or anywhere, Greece, Crete,

1366
00:46:23.391 --> 00:46:24.831
may not have been as isolated

1367
00:46:24.831 --> 00:46:27.510
as they appear now.

1368
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:29.558
What happens if the Mediterranean was not as big

1369
00:46:29.558 --> 00:46:31.179
as it was today, you know etcetera, etcetera.

1370
00:46:31.179 --> 00:46:32.939
If you go down that road you start to see

1371
00:46:32.939 --> 00:46:34.518
just take on the board that the map

1372
00:46:34.518 --> 00:46:35.755
didn't look like what it did today.

1373
00:46:35.755 --> 00:46:37.259
The Hungary didn't have those borders.

1374
00:46:37.259 --> 00:46:38.496
France didn't have those borders.

1375
00:46:38.496 --> 00:46:40.352
These were all modern constructions.

1376
00:46:40.352 --> 00:46:41.931
And unfortunately, people who has been educated

1377
00:46:41.931 --> 00:46:43.306
within the last 20 years, they look at that

1378
00:46:43.306 --> 00:46:45.280
and they think that's been there for thousands of years.

1379
00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:47.626
They have no idea that the world looked totally different.

1380
00:46:47.626 --> 00:46:49.482
They got to get their heads around that alone.

1381
00:46:49.482 --> 00:46:52.879
Africa use to have tropical, you know, rainforests.

1382
00:46:52.879 --> 00:46:53.738
You know, crocodiles--

1383
00:46:53.738 --> 00:46:55.075
<v Voiceover>Egypt, absolutely.</v>

1384
00:46:55.075 --> 00:46:57.492
<v ->All over the Libyan desert.</v>

1385
00:46:58.128 --> 00:47:00.165
Turkey is still considered geologically

1386
00:47:00.165 --> 00:47:03.162
a Western culture, a Western in all it's botany

1387
00:47:03.162 --> 00:47:05.210
and it's, you know, archeology.

1388
00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:06.927
And racially, the races that lived there

1389
00:47:06.927 --> 00:47:09.199
were basically caucasian races, you see.

1390
00:47:09.199 --> 00:47:11.215
Okay, but let's go continue with that thread

1391
00:47:11.215 --> 00:47:12.793
of this Akhenaten.

1392
00:47:12.793 --> 00:47:15.673
First step is to realize that Egypt had connections

1393
00:47:15.673 --> 00:47:18.372
with the West.

1394
00:47:18.372 --> 00:47:21.763
So when individuals were finding cocaine,

1395
00:47:21.763 --> 00:47:23.854
in the tombs of mummies, when they're finding

1396
00:47:23.854 --> 00:47:25.987
images of elephants in South America

1397
00:47:25.987 --> 00:47:28.238
and parrot feathers in Egypt again.

1398
00:47:28.238 --> 00:47:30.526
All of this, tobacco that they're finding.

1399
00:47:31.258 --> 00:47:32.399
Why is that so difficult to realize

1400
00:47:32.399 --> 00:47:33.860
that there was these connections?

1401
00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:35.524
<v Voiceover>So, let's just add to the mix</v>

1402
00:47:35.524 --> 00:47:37.732
of possibility that it was easy to move

1403
00:47:37.732 --> 00:47:39.108
people and things around by air

1404
00:47:39.108 --> 00:47:41.499
in addition to a donkey and a cart.

1405
00:47:41.499 --> 00:47:42.329
With land bridges.

1406
00:47:42.329 --> 00:47:43.058
<v ->No doubt about it.</v>

1407
00:47:43.058 --> 00:47:44.871
I have no personal problem taking that on.

1408
00:47:44.871 --> 00:47:46.194
There's so many antidotes even coming

1409
00:47:46.194 --> 00:47:49.660
out of the Vedic traditions

1410
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:52.881
that there was aerial, (mumbling) and all that--

1411
00:47:52.881 --> 00:47:53.811
But let's say for a moment--

1412
00:47:53.811 --> 00:47:55.645
<v Voiceover>However they could move--</v>

1413
00:47:55.645 --> 00:47:57.917
<v ->Okay, but even if we don't, say it just was done</v>

1414
00:47:57.917 --> 00:47:59.416
on horseback or boat,

1415
00:47:59.416 --> 00:48:01.250
why is it still too difficult to realize, you know,

1416
00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:03.128
with the land bridges that it was even walkable.

1417
00:48:03.128 --> 00:48:04.429
The ancient legends say it was

1418
00:48:04.429 --> 00:48:06.146
and as I said, that's usually good enough for me.

1419
00:48:06.146 --> 00:48:07.543
I let science do the catch up.

1420
00:48:07.543 --> 00:48:09.591
And they're doing it.

1421
00:48:09.591 --> 00:48:10.818
You know, Professor Erlingsson's book

1422
00:48:10.818 --> 00:48:12.652
is called Atlantis in Ireland.

1423
00:48:12.652 --> 00:48:14.050
You know, it's also called Atlantis

1424
00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:18.337
from a geographical perspective or something like that.

1425
00:48:19.607 --> 00:48:22.166
Okay, once you take on board those two facts,

1426
00:48:22.166 --> 00:48:23.071
just those two facts,

1427
00:48:23.071 --> 00:48:24.351
that the land bridges existed

1428
00:48:24.351 --> 00:48:26.783
and that the elements moved from the West to the East,

1429
00:48:26.783 --> 00:48:28.127
you have now revised history,

1430
00:48:28.127 --> 00:48:30.335
whether you know it or not.

1431
00:48:30.335 --> 00:48:31.593
<v Voiceover>So, yes you have.</v>

1432
00:48:31.593 --> 00:48:33.705
<v ->You have just turned a lot of things upside down.</v>

1433
00:48:33.705 --> 00:48:35.167
<v Voiceover>You made possible</v>

1434
00:48:35.167 --> 00:48:37.022
what didn't look possible prior

1435
00:48:37.022 --> 00:48:39.977
and again, you're talking about the Diluvian age.

1436
00:48:39.977 --> 00:48:43.155
So you're saying there was an already existing

1437
00:48:43.155 --> 00:48:46.131
very refined high culture as exemplified

1438
00:48:46.131 --> 00:48:49.096
through a lot of the Druidic practices, for example.

1439
00:48:49.096 --> 00:48:51.539
And again, Druid means (mumbling).

1440
00:48:51.539 --> 00:48:53.768
<v ->It means keeper of truth.</v>

1441
00:48:53.768 --> 00:48:54.835
<v Voiceover>Keeper of truth.</v>

1442
00:48:54.835 --> 00:48:57.128
So that you had a very high culture.

1443
00:48:57.128 --> 00:48:58.226
From what I'm understanding,

1444
00:48:58.226 --> 00:49:02.452
you're saying that culture had migrated into Egypt.

1445
00:49:02.452 --> 00:49:04.126
In fact, at one point--

1446
00:49:04.126 --> 00:49:05.289
<v ->Because of the cataclysms.</v>

1447
00:49:05.289 --> 00:49:06.356
<v Voiceover>Because of the cataclysms.</v>

1448
00:49:06.356 --> 00:49:07.262
<v ->So see how the Atlantis book</v>

1449
00:49:07.262 --> 00:49:08.350
connects with the Irish Origins?

1450
00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:08.862
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

1451
00:49:08.862 --> 00:49:10.121
<v ->Even different titles, they're basically</v>

1452
00:49:10.121 --> 00:49:11.891
one continuous study.

1453
00:49:11.891 --> 00:49:15.656
I would only say that the Irish Origins jump starts

1454
00:49:15.656 --> 00:49:17.160
what died with Comyns Beaumont.

1455
00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.131
When Comyns Beaumont was doing

1456
00:49:18.131 --> 00:49:19.710
the West to East thing,

1457
00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:20.893
it lapsed after his time.

1458
00:49:20.893 --> 00:49:22.568
I'm the first person to kick start it.

1459
00:49:22.568 --> 00:49:23.272
<v Voiceover>Pick it back up again, yeah.</v>

1460
00:49:23.272 --> 00:49:23.912
<v ->I'm not the expert,</v>

1461
00:49:23.912 --> 00:49:26.792
but I'm hoping that we can kick start the subject

1462
00:49:26.792 --> 00:49:28.093
so people can go on.

1463
00:49:28.093 --> 00:49:29.256
And by the way, people are contributing

1464
00:49:29.256 --> 00:49:30.909
to my websites, it is happening.

1465
00:49:30.909 --> 00:49:32.925
We're getting incredible support here.

1466
00:49:32.925 --> 00:49:34.130
And more adults coming around

1467
00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:35.367
from all around the world in this.

1468
00:49:38.012 --> 00:49:40.444
<v ->Next month, we'll post part two of our conversation</v>

1469
00:49:40.444 --> 00:49:43.100
with Michael, in which he tells why he feels

1470
00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:44.764
the Egyptian Pharaoh, Akhenaten

1471
00:49:44.764 --> 00:49:46.556
and his followers exported

1472
00:49:46.556 --> 00:49:49.894
what we now know as the world's architects of control.

1473
00:49:49.894 --> 00:49:52.497
Meanwhile, you can pick up a copy of Irish Origins

1474
00:49:52.497 --> 00:49:54.267
by going to Michael's website at

1475
00:49:54.267 --> 00:49:57.766
www.taroscopes.com

1476
00:49:57.766 --> 00:50:00.224
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
