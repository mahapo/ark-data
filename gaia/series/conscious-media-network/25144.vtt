00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:13.272
<v ->With all of the information swirling about regarding the</v>

3
00:00:13.272 --> 00:00:16.071
future if human kind, technology, politics,

4
00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:19.141
paranormal phenomena, and so forth, sometimes we just have

5
00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:20.691
to go back to basics.

6
00:00:20.691 --> 00:00:23.171
Throughout our journey of educating ourselves, the one thing

7
00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:26.512
that shouldn't be overlooked is the need to go deeper within

8
00:00:26.512 --> 00:00:28.711
and connect with our own true self.

9
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:31.551
Helaine Harris is a marriage and family therapist who uses

10
00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:34.932
dozens of modalities to help her clients find that place

11
00:00:34.932 --> 00:00:37.311
of love or essence deep inside.

12
00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:40.231
In the end, she says this is what's going to take us through

13
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:43.041
all of the other changes with grace.

14
00:00:44.391 --> 00:00:46.912
The reason I wanted to talk to you Helaine is because

15
00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:50.571
as everyone is contending with kind of chaotic energies

16
00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:54.031
in a lot of cases going on right now, on many levels,

17
00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:58.251
the one thing I'm constantly reminded of is that we have

18
00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:02.791
to find our way to that place inside ourselves that

19
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:07.511
already has what you want to call the love frequency going.

20
00:01:07.511 --> 00:01:08.231
<v ->Right.</v>

21
00:01:08.231 --> 00:01:09.452
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Because you cannot be in fear</v>

22
00:01:09.452 --> 00:01:11.031
and in love at the same time.

23
00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:14.461
And this is a journey that you've spent a great deal of time

24
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:15.751
invested in.

25
00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:16.731
<v ->Oh yes.</v>

26
00:01:16.731 --> 00:01:17.361
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Yes.</v>

27
00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:18.381
(women chuckle)

28
00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:20.971
And you wrote a book called Are You in Love with a Vampire,

29
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:21.931
for example.

30
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:22.532
( woman interviewer chuckles)

31
00:01:22.532 --> 00:01:23.071
<v ->Right.</v>

32
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:23.822
(Helaine chuckles)

33
00:01:23.822 --> 00:01:24.792
<v ->[Woman interviewer] And this wasn't part of the common</v>

34
00:01:24.792 --> 00:01:27.551
movie themes that are going on right now.

35
00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:28.621
<v ->No, it was before then.</v>

36
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:29.691
<v ->[Woman interviewer] It was before then.</v>

37
00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:34.091
And so, energetics being an empath and so forth, I wanted

38
00:01:34.091 --> 00:01:37.261
to talk to you about what you're seeing among your clients

39
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:42.151
right now and some of the tools you're giving them

40
00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:45.622
to deal with to bring about genuine feelings

41
00:01:45.622 --> 00:01:48.831
of the frequency of love.

42
00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:49.671
<v ->Okay.</v>

43
00:01:50.651 --> 00:01:52.911
One of the biggest things I have my clients work with

44
00:01:52.911 --> 00:01:55.372
is meeting their inner guidance, their inner wisdom,

45
00:01:55.372 --> 00:01:59.301
their inner knowing, because that helps them so much.

46
00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:02.341
And I give them a lot of meditation tools because it's about

47
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:04.561
going in and getting quiet.

48
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:09.052
It's about finding who are we and getting rid of the mask

49
00:02:09.052 --> 00:02:12.791
we carry and becoming the truth of who we are instead

50
00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:15.201
of following the shoulds and the rules and what we've

51
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:16.391
been taught.

52
00:02:16.391 --> 00:02:19.591
It's finding your true essence.

53
00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:21.812
And so many people have difficulty with that.

54
00:02:21.812 --> 00:02:24.501
Most of my clients do, and that's really

55
00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:25.381
what the work is about.

56
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:26.751
<v ->[Woman interviewer] I think most people on the planet do.</v>

57
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:29.602
We don't even know we have, I think the vast majority

58
00:02:29.602 --> 00:02:31.511
of people don't know they have a true essence.

59
00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:33.491
<v ->True. True.</v>

60
00:02:33.491 --> 00:02:34.482
<v ->[Woman interviewer] I mean, so this is part of the problem</v>

61
00:02:34.482 --> 00:02:36.932
is identifying that this part exists and then learning

62
00:02:36.932 --> 00:02:39.691
to access it, which is certainly going to pull all of us

63
00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:42.651
through anything we need to be pulled through, in this time

64
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:43.692
and beyond.

65
00:02:43.692 --> 00:02:45.131
<v ->I think it's the only thing that's gonna really</v>

66
00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:45.902
pull us to.

67
00:02:45.902 --> 00:02:46.871
It's a new time.

68
00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:49.282
It's a global transformation.

69
00:02:49.282 --> 00:02:51.861
And this is a call to it.

70
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:54.571
And I think for many people what I try and let them know

71
00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:56.892
it's the crisis they're going through, the problem

72
00:02:56.892 --> 00:02:59.751
they're going through, that can call them to their healing

73
00:02:59.751 --> 00:03:01.261
and what they need to do.

74
00:03:01.261 --> 00:03:05.811
And so, the tools are about going inwards, meditation.

75
00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:09.651
There are dozens of new energy modalities, and I've trained

76
00:03:09.651 --> 00:03:11.261
in at least 10 of them.

77
00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:11.982
(Helaine chuckles)

78
00:03:11.982 --> 00:03:12.511
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Yes.</v>

79
00:03:12.511 --> 00:03:15.601
<v ->And there's some wonderful, wonderful methods for turning</v>

80
00:03:15.601 --> 00:03:17.741
around the inner programming.

81
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:20.261
It's time to update our computers.

82
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:20.781
(Helaine chuckles)

83
00:03:20.781 --> 00:03:21.871
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Yes, definitely.</v>

84
00:03:21.871 --> 00:03:24.951
<v ->And release the old, the old programs, and not just</v>

85
00:03:24.951 --> 00:03:28.381
the old programs mentally, it's literally shifting the

86
00:03:28.381 --> 00:03:30.551
neural pathways in the brain.

87
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:33.491
Someone from the last lecture you were at came over after,

88
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:35.691
and it's like what I was realizing I was trying to do

89
00:03:35.691 --> 00:03:38.171
in the brain with energy and the Emotional

90
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:39.681
Freedom Technique, or remedy in tapping.

91
00:03:39.681 --> 00:03:40.631
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Yeah, EFT.</v>

92
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:43.821
<v ->Was shifting the neural pathways to create a new</v>

93
00:03:43.821 --> 00:03:47.311
neural pathway for love that goes to safety instead

94
00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:49.131
of love connected to abuse.

95
00:03:49.131 --> 00:03:51.271
Because I happen to work with many people who have

96
00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:55.291
been abused, and trauma is one of the most horrible things,

97
00:03:55.291 --> 00:03:59.782
and I have become quite an expert at it out of necessity.

98
00:03:59.782 --> 00:04:03.761
So, it's teaching people techniques they can use.

99
00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:07.731
And why I like EFT is it's safe for people to do at home.

100
00:04:07.731 --> 00:04:12.231
I only had one client in over 10, 11 years already

101
00:04:12.231 --> 00:04:14.951
who had some difficulty for awhile by herself.

102
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:16.371
But then could do it.

103
00:04:16.371 --> 00:04:18.532
So, that's a safe technique.

104
00:04:18.532 --> 00:04:22.711
And going inwards, I really believe that the core of

105
00:04:22.711 --> 00:04:24.452
who we are is love.

106
00:04:24.452 --> 00:04:28.781
And we get stuck in trying to please other people,

107
00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:32.391
trying to run all these programs of the shoulds, and what

108
00:04:32.391 --> 00:04:33.891
we're supposed to do, and it takes away from

109
00:04:33.891 --> 00:04:35.612
our real essence.

110
00:04:35.612 --> 00:04:39.901
And it's very interesting that gradually I get people

111
00:04:39.901 --> 00:04:43.021
to open not only their inner guidance but the spirit.

112
00:04:43.021 --> 00:04:44.992
I just say use the words that are comfortable.

113
00:04:44.992 --> 00:04:47.941
Just tap in, call in, spirit or god, or love,

114
00:04:47.941 --> 00:04:50.091
or higher self, or inner wisdom.

115
00:04:50.091 --> 00:04:54.511
And by allowing them the freedom to use the words they're

116
00:04:54.511 --> 00:04:57.452
comfortable with, then, they can do that.

117
00:04:57.452 --> 00:05:01.221
And I also work with people who don't believe at all.

118
00:05:01.221 --> 00:05:04.042
And because I was an atheist for awhile, and then

119
00:05:04.042 --> 00:05:07.241
an agnostic, and then I was hit by the light, literally.

120
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:07.751
(Helaine chuckles)

121
00:05:07.751 --> 00:05:11.492
I had, literally, an experience, a mystical experience,

122
00:05:11.492 --> 00:05:13.252
an experience of grace

123
00:05:13.252 --> 00:05:16.251
through sacred sexuality experience, and changed

124
00:05:16.251 --> 00:05:17.562
my life totally.

125
00:05:17.562 --> 00:05:21.381
So, to be able to live in that frequency

126
00:05:21.381 --> 00:05:23.941
of love is a process.

127
00:05:25.011 --> 00:05:26.651
I believe love is a choice.

128
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:29.531
And it's not just a choice of loving a particular partner.

129
00:05:29.531 --> 00:05:31.451
I think it's much greater than that.

130
00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:35.041
So, my hope, my desire, is

131
00:05:35.041 --> 00:05:37.091
to help people love themselves,

132
00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:41.071
to love themselves enough to find out who they are

133
00:05:41.071 --> 00:05:45.032
and follow their own calling, and follow their own energy

134
00:05:45.032 --> 00:05:49.202
vibration, find their own pathway, find their own process,

135
00:05:49.202 --> 00:05:54.081
their own form of meditation, of prayer, of religious

136
00:05:54.081 --> 00:05:57.611
experience or non-religious experience, you know.

137
00:05:58.631 --> 00:05:59.891
<v ->[Woman interviewer] It is the antidote.</v>

138
00:05:59.891 --> 00:06:01.521
<v ->It's the only thing that's gonna work.</v>

139
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:03.632
<v ->[Woman interviewer] To whatever chaos is maybe prevailing</v>

140
00:06:03.632 --> 00:06:05.502
in a person's life, and let's take that.

141
00:06:05.502 --> 00:06:08.171
Because when we're speaking of some of the chaos

142
00:06:08.171 --> 00:06:11.191
that's occurring right now, aside from what we see

143
00:06:11.191 --> 00:06:16.031
politically and around us in other ways, and even in terms

144
00:06:16.031 --> 00:06:19.091
of weather patterns and so forth, it's also blowing

145
00:06:19.091 --> 00:06:21.711
through our personal lives and our personal relationships.

146
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:23.122
And I hear this quite a lot.

147
00:06:23.122 --> 00:06:26.171
People are waking up and deciding I have to go.

148
00:06:26.171 --> 00:06:27.831
I can't be in this relationship anymore.

149
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:29.712
This is, this seems to be happening a lot.

150
00:06:29.712 --> 00:06:30.991
A lot of people are dying.

151
00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:31.911
<v ->A lot of people are dying.</v>

152
00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:32.911
<v ->[Woman interviewer] At an accelerated rate, they're</v>

153
00:06:32.911 --> 00:06:33.721
leaving the planet.

154
00:06:33.721 --> 00:06:36.332
<v ->They don't want to be here in this time period because</v>

155
00:06:36.332 --> 00:06:39.401
it's a difficult time period, and it takes courage.

156
00:06:39.401 --> 00:06:41.971
You either take courage and you begin moving through

157
00:06:41.971 --> 00:06:44.731
your issues to get to a higher level of vibration,

158
00:06:44.731 --> 00:06:47.851
because that's what I think it's all about, or you drop

159
00:06:47.851 --> 00:06:48.791
lower down.

160
00:06:48.791 --> 00:06:49.571
(Helaine chuckles)

161
00:06:49.571 --> 00:06:51.811
Whether the anxiety takes over the depression, or anxiety

162
00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:54.621
first then depression, or depression first then anxiety,

163
00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:58.471
it'll keep taking over, whether you're gonna think your

164
00:06:58.471 --> 00:07:00.151
born under a dark cloud or whatever.

165
00:07:00.151 --> 00:07:04.311
So, it's about lifting our own awareness, and their are

166
00:07:04.311 --> 00:07:06.071
so many modalities.

167
00:07:06.071 --> 00:07:09.441
I mean, I use 40 different techniques as a therapist because

168
00:07:09.441 --> 00:07:11.442
I haven't found one that does it all.

169
00:07:11.442 --> 00:07:14.651
No matter what each person said, oh yes this is the way.

170
00:07:14.651 --> 00:07:17.031
Well, it's a way for some.

171
00:07:17.031 --> 00:07:18.711
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Right, and this is important.</v>

172
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:20.261
There is no magic bullet.

173
00:07:20.261 --> 00:07:21.931
No one single thing that works
<v Helaine>None. None.</v>

174
00:07:21.931 --> 00:07:22.951
for everybody.

175
00:07:22.951 --> 00:07:27.531
But, that said, if a person can find a way through these

176
00:07:27.531 --> 00:07:32.162
various modalities to go into that loving essence

177
00:07:32.162 --> 00:07:34.791
of self that is the one magic bullet.

178
00:07:34.791 --> 00:07:35.921
that I can see.
<v Helaine>That is the one</v>

179
00:07:35.921 --> 00:07:36.422
magic bullet.

180
00:07:36.422 --> 00:07:36.892
I agree.

181
00:07:36.892 --> 00:07:38.062
<v ->[Woman interviewer] And, I mean, I interview many people.</v>

182
00:07:38.062 --> 00:07:38.761
I hear it all.

183
00:07:38.761 --> 00:07:40.751
The only magic bullet is still finding this is still finding

184
00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:41.851
this place to love.

185
00:07:41.851 --> 00:07:43.211
<v ->Yeah. Yeah.</v>

186
00:07:43.211 --> 00:07:45.592
To love themselves, to love who they are, to love what

187
00:07:45.592 --> 00:07:48.551
they're doing, and if they don't love what they're,

188
00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:51.351
it's not what they choose, they're profession, then

189
00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:53.831
learn to love it anyway, or love parts of it.

190
00:07:53.831 --> 00:07:54.872
Maybe not all of it.

191
00:07:54.872 --> 00:07:56.091
You know, tolerate some of it.

192
00:07:56.091 --> 00:07:56.811
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Right.</v>

193
00:07:56.811 --> 00:08:00.551
<v ->But then to do, to keep that highest vibration possible</v>

194
00:08:00.551 --> 00:08:02.271
for as long as possible.

195
00:08:02.271 --> 00:08:04.412
<v ->[Woman interviewer] It's the only way you can also really</v>

196
00:08:04.412 --> 00:08:05.971
awaken intuitively isn't it.

197
00:08:05.971 --> 00:08:06.771
<v ->Yes.</v>

198
00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:09.441
And you automatically awaken intuitively.

199
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:12.572
My intern in my booth was asking me how did I become

200
00:08:12.572 --> 00:08:15.821
so intuitive 'cause I'm doing these five minute readings.

201
00:08:17.041 --> 00:08:18.231
I had no one train me.

202
00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:20.781
I had never been trained as a channel and so forth.

203
00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:22.672
The only thing I did was heal me.

204
00:08:22.672 --> 00:08:23.441
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Right.</v>

205
00:08:23.441 --> 00:08:26.271
<v ->It's taken me many, many years, and I call me what</v>

206
00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:27.791
was the normal neurotic.

207
00:08:27.791 --> 00:08:30.491
I mean I didn't have serious physical abuse or anything

208
00:08:30.491 --> 00:08:33.122
like that, and it's taken me many a year.

209
00:08:33.122 --> 00:08:35.112
And many different modalities.

210
00:08:35.112 --> 00:08:38.701
I mean traditional therapy didn't work for me, and I had

211
00:08:38.701 --> 00:08:41.601
to look outside the box because the box didn't,

212
00:08:41.601 --> 00:08:43.192
I didn't fit the box.

213
00:08:43.192 --> 00:08:44.231
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Right.</v>

214
00:08:44.231 --> 00:08:47.011
And one of the things that you did and many, many people

215
00:08:47.011 --> 00:08:48.111
keep doing it.

216
00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:50.312
And I'm going to bring it up because I think it illustrates

217
00:08:50.312 --> 00:08:53.441
what's going on with the rest of our lives as resonance

218
00:08:53.441 --> 00:08:56.951
is that we find ourselves in these patterns, as you say,

219
00:08:56.951 --> 00:09:00.511
whether it's neurotic patterns or whatnot, where we keep

220
00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:03.611
attracting the same kinds of situations to us.

221
00:09:03.611 --> 00:09:07.101
Now, so we can talk about it through relationships,

222
00:09:07.101 --> 00:09:11.471
coworkers, friends, family, and one thing you were

223
00:09:11.471 --> 00:09:15.191
talking about earlier today was the need to have to

224
00:09:15.191 --> 00:09:20.081
now really get down to brass tacks and start breaking

225
00:09:20.081 --> 00:09:21.351
these patterns.

226
00:09:21.351 --> 00:09:22.471
It's critical we break them now.

227
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:23.201
<v ->Yes. Yes.</v>

228
00:09:23.201 --> 00:09:24.072
<v ->[Woman interviewer] We do not want to continue in the</v>

229
00:09:24.072 --> 00:09:25.821
times ahead with these patterns.

230
00:09:25.821 --> 00:09:27.171
Talk about that for a little bit if you will.

231
00:09:27.171 --> 00:09:28.522
<v ->Sure, I'd be happy to.</v>

232
00:09:28.522 --> 00:09:31.971
What happens is we go through experiences when we're young,

233
00:09:31.971 --> 00:09:34.911
and we go into a certain kind of patterning in order

234
00:09:34.911 --> 00:09:38.482
to deal with our family, usually our family, right.

235
00:09:38.482 --> 00:09:41.131
Whether it has to do with love, or money, or career,

236
00:09:41.131 --> 00:09:45.061
or whatever it is, it goes back to what we grew up with.

237
00:09:45.061 --> 00:09:47.871
Whether we're in reaction to it or against it, it doesn't

238
00:09:47.871 --> 00:09:48.922
make a difference.

239
00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:51.851
It creates a patterning, literally, an energy patterning

240
00:09:51.851 --> 00:09:55.751
inside our body, our frequency outside our body.

241
00:09:55.751 --> 00:09:59.022
And then, because whether we call it the law of attraction

242
00:09:59.022 --> 00:10:02.391
or anything else, we keep resonating a certain way,

243
00:10:02.391 --> 00:10:05.731
and we automatically draw others to do the same

244
00:10:05.731 --> 00:10:07.252
things to us.

245
00:10:07.252 --> 00:10:08.831
We may not know we're doing it.

246
00:10:08.831 --> 00:10:11.801
And this person may not look like an abuser.

247
00:10:11.801 --> 00:10:12.631
Okay.

248
00:10:12.631 --> 00:10:15.311
Or, a boss whose gonna hurt them, or wound them,

249
00:10:15.311 --> 00:10:17.271
or expect too much, or not pay them.

250
00:10:17.271 --> 00:10:19.672
I've had so many clients where that happened to.

251
00:10:19.672 --> 00:10:23.951
And all that happens is we manifest an energy of vibration

252
00:10:23.951 --> 00:10:26.761
that says take advantage of me, take advantage of me.

253
00:10:26.761 --> 00:10:28.252
Or, whatever it is.

254
00:10:28.252 --> 00:10:32.431
Or, deception, or let's get into a game of who can

255
00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:35.821
manipulate who more, and they do the same thing.

256
00:10:36.821 --> 00:10:38.952
The different face, the different body, the different

257
00:10:38.952 --> 00:10:39.991
employer.

258
00:10:39.991 --> 00:10:41.012
<v ->[Woman interviewer] The different name.</v>

259
00:10:41.012 --> 00:10:42.921
<v ->The different name, different height, different size</v>

260
00:10:42.921 --> 00:10:44.201
body even.

261
00:10:44.201 --> 00:10:46.472
And they look different, but it's the same kind

262
00:10:46.472 --> 00:10:49.071
of patterning, so it has to go back to shifting the

263
00:10:49.071 --> 00:10:50.291
pattern inside.

264
00:10:50.291 --> 00:10:52.182
And I see the patterning.

265
00:10:52.182 --> 00:10:55.211
I literally feel the energy lines in the body, how the

266
00:10:55.211 --> 00:10:58.641
pattern moves, but I also sense the energy outside.

267
00:10:58.641 --> 00:11:01.791
And there are layers to the energy vibrations, the different

268
00:11:01.791 --> 00:11:04.451
vibrational patterns, the different vibrational energy

269
00:11:04.451 --> 00:11:06.731
bodies above and around the body.

270
00:11:06.731 --> 00:11:09.612
So, there are healing kinds of ways, modalities, on all

271
00:11:09.612 --> 00:11:10.941
of these levels.

272
00:11:10.941 --> 00:11:12.581
And so, there's energy healing.

273
00:11:12.581 --> 00:11:16.051
There's, I do reiki work, which is literally body work

274
00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:17.571
to release the emotions.

275
00:11:17.571 --> 00:11:19.891
That was the first thing that worked for me.

276
00:11:19.891 --> 00:11:21.471
But it has to be done.

277
00:11:21.471 --> 00:11:23.081
You have to shift the pattern.

278
00:11:23.081 --> 00:11:26.501
And when you do, you begin to realize who you are,

279
00:11:27.521 --> 00:11:30.201
and it's very different from what we thought.

280
00:11:30.201 --> 00:11:34.791
It's like, oh, I didn't know this is who I am.

281
00:11:34.791 --> 00:11:39.221
I didn't know what I was searching for was inside.

282
00:11:39.221 --> 00:11:42.041
I look for love outside like everyone else does.

283
00:11:42.041 --> 00:11:42.892
Okay.

284
00:11:42.892 --> 00:11:46.012
And so, if it's not this person it's this person.

285
00:11:46.012 --> 00:11:48.631
Well, after enough relationships, you learn it's yourself.

286
00:11:48.631 --> 00:11:49.792
Or, at least I learned it.

287
00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:50.941
<v ->[Woman interviewer] The one common denominator.</v>

288
00:11:50.941 --> 00:11:52.731
<v ->It's the one common denominator is me.</v>

289
00:11:52.731 --> 00:11:55.152
And that's what I try and teach my clients.

290
00:11:55.152 --> 00:11:58.963
So, if you're wanting love go for love.

291
00:11:58.963 --> 00:12:00.482
Go for being loving.

292
00:12:00.482 --> 00:12:03.331
Go for loving yourself, loving whatever you do.

293
00:12:03.331 --> 00:12:08.011
Find, even if it's a flower you enjoy looking at,

294
00:12:08.011 --> 00:12:12.052
and appreciating, and loving, gratitude, start there.

295
00:12:12.052 --> 00:12:14.082
I have them do gratitude journals.

296
00:12:15.102 --> 00:12:18.091
I'm working with a group with money, and abundance,

297
00:12:18.091 --> 00:12:22.811
and love, so I have them do now a positive evidence

298
00:12:22.811 --> 00:12:24.372
gratitude journal.

299
00:12:24.372 --> 00:12:27.231
Positive evidence is that spirit is with you, that the

300
00:12:27.231 --> 00:12:29.121
universe is with you.

301
00:12:29.121 --> 00:12:31.852
And to do it daily and so forth.

302
00:12:31.852 --> 00:12:34.792
And these things are important, so not just working with

303
00:12:34.792 --> 00:12:37.951
an inner guide, but I'm starting to teach some of my clients

304
00:12:37.951 --> 00:12:41.731
how to work with a divine team, a divine healing team,

305
00:12:41.731 --> 00:12:43.672
a divine business team.

306
00:12:43.672 --> 00:12:48.481
You know, how do I prepare for the expo when the time

307
00:12:48.481 --> 00:12:51.191
got short because of what I was going through before.

308
00:12:51.191 --> 00:12:54.471
And instead of six weeks, I have now two and 1/2 weeks

309
00:12:54.471 --> 00:12:55.831
to prepare everything.

310
00:12:55.831 --> 00:12:56.851
It's like, ahhh.

311
00:12:56.851 --> 00:12:57.442
(Helaine chuckles)

312
00:12:57.442 --> 00:12:58.032
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Right.</v>

313
00:12:58.032 --> 00:13:00.172
Well, we interviewed another woman named Jean Slatter

314
00:13:00.172 --> 00:13:01.411
who was just lovely.

315
00:13:01.411 --> 00:13:03.351
She wrote a book called Hiring the Heavens.

316
00:13:03.351 --> 00:13:03.901
<v ->Right.</v>

317
00:13:03.901 --> 00:13:05.161
<v ->[Woman interviewer] And a lot of our viewers really</v>

318
00:13:05.161 --> 00:13:07.031
responded to it because it's exactly what

319
00:13:07.031 --> 00:13:08.181
you're talking about.

320
00:13:08.181 --> 00:13:08.681
<v ->It's hiring the heavens.</v>

321
00:13:08.681 --> 00:13:10.161
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Which is hire the heavens.</v>

322
00:13:10.161 --> 00:13:10.612
<v ->Yes.</v>

323
00:13:10.612 --> 00:13:11.761
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Here we have this incredible</v>

324
00:13:11.761 --> 00:13:15.111
guidance around us that we're largely unaware of,

325
00:13:15.111 --> 00:13:18.782
and, otherwise, we're afraid to ask anything of

326
00:13:18.782 --> 00:13:20.411
in a lot of cases.
<v Helaine>Right. Right.</v>

327
00:13:20.411 --> 00:13:21.781
<v ->[Woman interviewer] And so you're saying the same</v>

328
00:13:21.781 --> 00:13:23.502
thing essentially.
<v Helaine>I am saying that.</v>

329
00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:24.641
Use the resources that are there.

330
00:13:24.641 --> 00:13:25.081
<v ->Yes.</v>

331
00:13:25.081 --> 00:13:27.072
<v ->[Woman interviewer] What about the notion of while we're</v>

332
00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:30.151
getting our sea legs, and learning to truly embrace

333
00:13:30.151 --> 00:13:33.472
ourselves and our essence again.

334
00:13:33.472 --> 00:13:36.462
Of the notion of going where love is.

335
00:13:36.462 --> 00:13:41.142
So, you can experience and feel it when you're in that

336
00:13:41.142 --> 00:13:44.441
crossover point of learning, and breaking the old patterns.

337
00:13:44.441 --> 00:13:46.722
<v ->And what I teach them is find love anywhere.</v>

338
00:13:46.722 --> 00:13:47.391
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Yes.</v>

339
00:13:47.391 --> 00:13:48.352
<v ->An animal.</v>

340
00:13:48.352 --> 00:13:51.691
So, if you are afraid of people and people aren't safe

341
00:13:51.691 --> 00:13:53.691
go with an animal, a cat, a dog.

342
00:13:53.691 --> 00:13:54.951
Children are safer.

343
00:13:54.951 --> 00:13:56.031
Love a baby.

344
00:13:56.031 --> 00:13:57.631
How can you not love a grandchild?

345
00:13:57.631 --> 00:13:58.371
Well, for me.

346
00:13:58.371 --> 00:13:58.971
(Helaine chuckles)

347
00:13:58.971 --> 00:14:00.251
The grandchild.

348
00:14:00.251 --> 00:14:03.871
But anything you love, because it feels so good.

349
00:14:03.871 --> 00:14:05.431
It feels so good.

350
00:14:05.431 --> 00:14:09.411
And if it's not a person, find a thing, you know.

351
00:14:09.411 --> 00:14:10.951
I love that book.

352
00:14:10.951 --> 00:14:12.521
I love that phrase.

353
00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:16.051
Driving home one day, I was aware of, ahh, the sky looks

354
00:14:16.051 --> 00:14:17.151
so beautiful.

355
00:14:17.151 --> 00:14:17.792
It's sunny.

356
00:14:17.792 --> 00:14:18.831
I hadn't been out all day.

357
00:14:18.831 --> 00:14:21.491
I was inside, right, 'cause I work inside often.

358
00:14:21.491 --> 00:14:26.001
Wow, just take a moment, and gradually those moments

359
00:14:26.001 --> 00:14:28.971
expand into a minute.

360
00:14:28.971 --> 00:14:29.792
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Absolutely.</v>

361
00:14:29.792 --> 00:14:30.671
<v ->That's the key.</v>

362
00:14:30.671 --> 00:14:33.111
It's taking a moment to loving.

363
00:14:33.111 --> 00:14:34.172
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Isn't it really putting yourself</v>

364
00:14:34.172 --> 00:14:37.971
in resonance with that frequency, which is the transcendent

365
00:14:37.971 --> 00:14:38.941
frequency of the universe.

366
00:14:38.941 --> 00:14:39.701
<v ->That is a transcendent.</v>

367
00:14:39.701 --> 00:14:40.581
Absolutely.

368
00:14:40.581 --> 00:14:42.321
And that's the only way it's gonna happen.

369
00:14:42.321 --> 00:14:47.262
And it seems difficult when, oh, I can't heal all my issues.

370
00:14:47.262 --> 00:14:48.841
Don't start with all your issues.

371
00:14:48.841 --> 00:14:53.631
Start with you feel good being here right now, for a moment.

372
00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:54.311
Okay.

373
00:14:54.311 --> 00:14:56.931
It doesn't last for an hour or two, or five days, but it

374
00:14:56.931 --> 00:14:59.191
lasted for five minutes.

375
00:14:59.191 --> 00:15:00.352
Isn't that great.

376
00:15:00.352 --> 00:15:01.851
It's better than what you had before.

377
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:04.111
The next time we go for seven minutes.

378
00:15:04.111 --> 00:15:08.971
It's shifting it a little bit at a time because most people

379
00:15:08.971 --> 00:15:11.232
can't imagine the jump.

380
00:15:11.232 --> 00:15:14.672
And frankly, when they're ready for a huge jump, they do it

381
00:15:14.672 --> 00:15:16.142
in a huge jump.

382
00:15:16.142 --> 00:15:19.511
But most people it would scare too much to suddenly evolve

383
00:15:19.511 --> 00:15:23.291
into this magnificent being, and seeing who they really are.

384
00:15:23.291 --> 00:15:27.271
A number of years ago, my shaman had me go to and meet

385
00:15:27.271 --> 00:15:29.881
my fully-embraced self.

386
00:15:29.881 --> 00:15:31.581
And it was too much.

387
00:15:31.581 --> 00:15:34.532
I mean, I couldn't do that.

388
00:15:34.532 --> 00:15:36.531
And that was maybe 20 years ago.

389
00:15:36.531 --> 00:15:37.851
<v ->[Woman interviewer] And then.</v>

390
00:15:37.851 --> 00:15:41.021
<v ->And then, in getting ready for the expo, I met with him.</v>

391
00:15:41.021 --> 00:15:43.212
I said, okay I have to go back to that.

392
00:15:43.212 --> 00:15:44.921
He said all you need to do is open Helaine.

393
00:15:44.921 --> 00:15:45.932
You know how to do it.

394
00:15:45.932 --> 00:15:47.052
And that was it.

395
00:15:47.052 --> 00:15:48.032
Alright.

396
00:15:48.032 --> 00:15:51.431
Because all I needed to do was connect in, connect into

397
00:15:51.431 --> 00:15:53.772
the spirit, feel a source.

398
00:15:53.772 --> 00:15:56.331
And say, okay, I really need the help to get all this ready

399
00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:57.062
in a short time.

400
00:15:57.062 --> 00:15:57.811
Right.

401
00:15:57.811 --> 00:15:58.321
Help.

402
00:15:58.321 --> 00:15:58.951
(Helaine chuckles)

403
00:15:58.951 --> 00:15:59.951
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Yes.</v>

404
00:15:59.951 --> 00:16:04.261
Well, and you mentioned earlier EFT.

405
00:16:04.261 --> 00:16:04.721
<v ->Right.</v>

406
00:16:04.721 --> 00:16:05.611
<v ->[Woman interviewer] And we've done one other</v>

407
00:16:05.611 --> 00:16:08.292
interview with Phillip Mountrose on EFT,

408
00:16:08.292 --> 00:16:09.972
which was delightful.

409
00:16:09.972 --> 00:16:14.171
And this is really has been catching on the last few years.

410
00:16:14.171 --> 00:16:14.831
<v ->Definitely.</v>

411
00:16:14.831 --> 00:16:15.961
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Around the globe.</v>

412
00:16:15.961 --> 00:16:16.721
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

413
00:16:16.721 --> 00:16:19.801
<v ->[Woman interviewer] And so, can you give an idea here</v>

414
00:16:19.801 --> 00:16:23.612
to the people watching of how to, how one would go about

415
00:16:23.612 --> 00:16:28.371
effectively using EFT to open themselves to their own

416
00:16:28.371 --> 00:16:29.991
essence of love.

417
00:16:29.991 --> 00:16:32.912
Because this is something that it's free.

418
00:16:32.912 --> 00:16:35.532
You can do it pretty much anywhere, anytime.

419
00:16:35.532 --> 00:16:37.452
You can start your day and end your day with it.

420
00:16:37.452 --> 00:16:40.322
And explain the science behind it.

421
00:16:40.322 --> 00:16:41.142
<v ->Okay.</v>

422
00:16:41.142 --> 00:16:44.512
That's a lot in a few minutes, but let's see if I can.

423
00:16:45.542 --> 00:16:46.751
(Helaine chuckles)

424
00:16:47.781 --> 00:16:48.691
Okay.

425
00:16:50.371 --> 00:16:54.231
Emotional Freedom Techniques was created by Gary Craig.

426
00:16:54.231 --> 00:16:58.661
And he's the founder of it, and he took it from Callahan

427
00:16:58.661 --> 00:17:00.341
with Thought Field Therapy.

428
00:17:00.341 --> 00:17:03.711
And I trained in that first because I was working on

429
00:17:03.711 --> 00:17:06.812
the body, and I saw all the energy modalities working.

430
00:17:06.812 --> 00:17:10.051
And I saw the way energy, I feel energy moving through

431
00:17:10.051 --> 00:17:10.931
the body.

432
00:17:10.931 --> 00:17:15.112
So, I was looking for, there had to be places to work

433
00:17:15.112 --> 00:17:17.451
on the body that would completely shift things.

434
00:17:17.451 --> 00:17:19.471
And I've worked with a shaman who tapped here.

435
00:17:19.471 --> 00:17:22.232
And I watched the whole energy pattern move through

436
00:17:22.232 --> 00:17:25.152
a person's body and out.

437
00:17:25.152 --> 00:17:28.011
So, I know those things are possible.

438
00:17:28.011 --> 00:17:32.781
So, I've been searching for probably 20 years for ways

439
00:17:32.781 --> 00:17:36.632
to move a whole pattern quickly

440
00:17:36.632 --> 00:17:38.502
out of the body.

441
00:17:38.502 --> 00:17:39.691
Alright.

442
00:17:39.691 --> 00:17:44.151
And what I like about EFT, over Thought Field Therapy,

443
00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:46.812
it's one kind of paradigm.

444
00:17:46.812 --> 00:17:48.511
One way to do it, not paradigm.

445
00:17:48.511 --> 00:17:52.052
But just one technique, it's just five or seven

446
00:17:52.052 --> 00:17:54.502
different points, 11 different points.

447
00:17:54.502 --> 00:17:57.202
In fact, Gary cut out doing the second part to it.

448
00:17:57.202 --> 00:17:59.031
Almost no one uses it now.

449
00:17:59.031 --> 00:18:01.262
Although sometimes I still like to.

450
00:18:02.852 --> 00:18:06.932
What you're doing is you're basically moving out the disease

451
00:18:06.932 --> 00:18:11.131
or the frequency that's a disharmony

452
00:18:11.131 --> 00:18:12.601
in the body.

453
00:18:12.601 --> 00:18:14.221
You're moving it out of the body.

454
00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:17.761
It's an energy vibration you're releasing from the body,

455
00:18:17.761 --> 00:18:21.252
and you're basically tapping on acupuncture meridians.

456
00:18:22.512 --> 00:18:25.771
And some of the energy modalities now you don't even tap.

457
00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.412
You just think them.

458
00:18:27.412 --> 00:18:29.311
You know, there are many forms.

459
00:18:29.311 --> 00:18:30.351
There are many forms.

460
00:18:30.351 --> 00:18:31.071
And I'm.

461
00:18:31.071 --> 00:18:32.541
<v ->[Woman interviewer] So, it's like breaking an energetic</v>

462
00:18:32.541 --> 00:18:35.732
matrix when you're releasing whatever is toxic that's

463
00:18:35.732 --> 00:18:38.731
blocking your system having to do with your emotions,

464
00:18:38.731 --> 00:18:40.411
your mind, your body, anything really.

465
00:18:40.411 --> 00:18:41.012
<v ->Anything.</v>

466
00:18:41.012 --> 00:18:42.661
And it works on just about everything.

467
00:18:42.661 --> 00:18:45.431
And it works better for some people some days,

468
00:18:45.431 --> 00:18:48.781
and everything is how you formulate the statements.

469
00:18:48.781 --> 00:18:53.691
So, I know in the workshop, I did it on this when using

470
00:18:53.691 --> 00:18:56.262
the karate chop way 'cause it's an easier one.

471
00:18:56.262 --> 00:18:58.741
Often, when I'm working with clients individually, I'll use

472
00:18:58.741 --> 00:19:02.701
the source spot because it'll tap differently meridians.

473
00:19:02.701 --> 00:19:05.041
It'll tap different feelings in the body.

474
00:19:05.041 --> 00:19:06.741
And I like that.

475
00:19:06.741 --> 00:19:09.072
So, it varies what I use.

476
00:19:09.072 --> 00:19:13.591
And what's so easy about it, all they have to do is even

477
00:19:13.591 --> 00:19:18.591
though I'm feeling this way, bad about x, y, z, and I want

478
00:19:18.632 --> 00:19:20.251
to get help and change it.

479
00:19:20.251 --> 00:19:22.852
And you know, say three different ways, releasing whatever,

480
00:19:22.852 --> 00:19:24.552
and then you just start tapping on the

481
00:19:24.552 --> 00:19:26.271
acupuncture meridians.

482
00:19:26.271 --> 00:19:28.632
And say the negative first.

483
00:19:28.632 --> 00:19:30.121
And they say, oh, but you're putting the negative

484
00:19:30.121 --> 00:19:30.942
in the body.

485
00:19:30.942 --> 00:19:31.821
You're not.

486
00:19:31.821 --> 00:19:35.112
Somehow, by going through the meridians, which are

487
00:19:35.112 --> 00:19:37.631
right here like this, and underarms, and the crown

488
00:19:37.631 --> 00:19:38.611
of the head.

489
00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:40.291
It changes it in the body.

490
00:19:40.291 --> 00:19:41.661
It shifts it.

491
00:19:43.041 --> 00:19:45.091
<v ->[Woman interviewer] And if that's your reality.</v>

492
00:19:45.091 --> 00:19:47.611
I mean, if the truth is you're feeling a certain amount

493
00:19:47.611 --> 00:19:52.251
of fear, or obstacles of some kind, whatever kind it is,

494
00:19:52.251 --> 00:19:57.251
you're allowing that to be in that moment at the beginning

495
00:19:57.571 --> 00:19:58.952
of the release process.

496
00:19:58.952 --> 00:20:00.361
You're not denying it I guess is part of it.

497
00:20:00.361 --> 00:20:01.211
<v ->You can't deny it.</v>

498
00:20:01.211 --> 00:20:02.001
It doesn't work.

499
00:20:02.001 --> 00:20:02.771
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Yeah, so you might as well just bring</v>

500
00:20:02.771 --> 00:20:04.841
it right up front and center.

501
00:20:04.841 --> 00:20:08.491
<v ->What I've learned is no matter how we want to do things</v>

502
00:20:08.491 --> 00:20:11.271
we have to start with where we're at.

503
00:20:11.271 --> 00:20:15.481
It doesn't work to begin somewhere else and say oh yes.

504
00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:16.162
<v ->[Woman interviewer] And wishful thinking.</v>

505
00:20:16.162 --> 00:20:17.321
<v ->I'm more loving.</v>

506
00:20:17.321 --> 00:20:17.961
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Right.</v>

507
00:20:17.961 --> 00:20:19.961
<v ->I'm not more loving now if that's not where I'm at.</v>

508
00:20:19.961 --> 00:20:22.451
Right now, I'm feeling resentful and angry about what

509
00:20:22.451 --> 00:20:25.261
happened yesterday, or two minutes ago when someone

510
00:20:25.261 --> 00:20:27.131
bumped me or whatever it is.

511
00:20:27.131 --> 00:20:29.021
So, you start there.

512
00:20:29.021 --> 00:20:32.491
And then you tap on that, and gradually it begins to shift.

513
00:20:33.501 --> 00:20:37.531
And what I like doing is I do really call it my angelic form

514
00:20:37.531 --> 00:20:40.992
of meridian tapping, or EFT, because I really do work with

515
00:20:40.992 --> 00:20:42.961
the guides and angels all the time when I do it.

516
00:20:42.961 --> 00:20:43.542
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Yes.</v>

517
00:20:43.542 --> 00:20:45.332
<v ->When I started I didn't do that.</v>

518
00:20:45.332 --> 00:20:47.481
And I would only do it part way through the process

519
00:20:47.481 --> 00:20:50.672
when they got very emotional, very disturbed, or they

520
00:20:50.672 --> 00:20:52.471
couldn't seem to release it so quickly.

521
00:20:52.471 --> 00:20:55.161
And then, I'd have them call on their guides, and it would

522
00:20:55.161 --> 00:20:56.501
shift much faster.

523
00:20:56.501 --> 00:20:59.731
And the understanding of what was happening came

524
00:20:59.731 --> 00:21:01.781
more dramatically, or clearer.

525
00:21:01.781 --> 00:21:03.361
And I like that.

526
00:21:03.361 --> 00:21:07.911
So, I just automatically had them do that.

527
00:21:07.911 --> 00:21:10.491
And the interesting thing is even when they don't believe

528
00:21:10.491 --> 00:21:13.871
in inner guides or spirit, over time, they start to.

529
00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:15.221
<v ->[Woman interviewer] When they start seeing the results.</v>

530
00:21:15.221 --> 00:21:16.852
That's what Jean was saying in her interview.

531
00:21:16.852 --> 00:21:18.811
That's what I've seen throughout my life.

532
00:21:18.811 --> 00:21:20.021
I just rely on it.

533
00:21:20.021 --> 00:21:20.862
(woman interviewer chuckles)

534
00:21:20.862 --> 00:21:21.511
Actually.

535
00:21:21.511 --> 00:21:22.291
<v ->And it's wonderful.</v>

536
00:21:22.291 --> 00:21:25.002
It's wonderful because they don't have to believe

537
00:21:25.002 --> 00:21:25.871
in any of it.

538
00:21:25.871 --> 00:21:27.631
All they have to do is be willing to try.

539
00:21:27.631 --> 00:21:28.431
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Right.</v>

540
00:21:28.431 --> 00:21:30.241
Okay, so now, let's construct it.

541
00:21:30.241 --> 00:21:33.231
Again, we're looking at this whole matrix of love

542
00:21:33.231 --> 00:21:34.421
within our being.

543
00:21:34.421 --> 00:21:38.531
We're looking at each person choosing whoever is watching

544
00:21:38.531 --> 00:21:41.962
this and makes this choice, choosing to come into alignment

545
00:21:41.962 --> 00:21:43.601
with that in themselves.

546
00:21:43.601 --> 00:21:45.911
Yet, we've felt very disconnected.

547
00:21:45.911 --> 00:21:48.301
And we felt shoved aside.

548
00:21:48.301 --> 00:21:51.921
In terms of the way we've been brought up, it's natural.

549
00:21:51.921 --> 00:21:52.931
That's the way the world is wired.

550
00:21:52.931 --> 00:21:53.941
<v ->Yeah, we all have different moons.</v>

551
00:21:53.941 --> 00:21:56.172
<v ->[Woman interviewer] So, how would you word that for</v>

552
00:21:56.172 --> 00:22:00.081
a person who is beginning the journey of really learning

553
00:22:00.081 --> 00:22:03.541
to open to their own true self, their own true love.

554
00:22:03.541 --> 00:22:04.672
<v ->Okay.</v>

555
00:22:04.672 --> 00:22:07.091
I would go through what their wound is.

556
00:22:07.091 --> 00:22:07.811
Okay.

557
00:22:07.811 --> 00:22:10.432
So, if they're talking about not having been heard

558
00:22:10.432 --> 00:22:13.761
as a child, or not having been seen.

559
00:22:13.761 --> 00:22:14.811
Alright.

560
00:22:15.911 --> 00:22:19.391
I'm hurt that my parents, or my father, my mother,

561
00:22:19.391 --> 00:22:22.891
my last guy, girlfriend ignored me.

562
00:22:22.891 --> 00:22:24.351
I don't like to feel ignored.

563
00:22:24.351 --> 00:22:25.712
It hurts me when I'm ignored.

564
00:22:25.712 --> 00:22:27.111
When I'm ignored I don't feel loved.

565
00:22:27.111 --> 00:22:28.141
I feel alone.

566
00:22:28.141 --> 00:22:29.272
I feel abandoned.

567
00:22:29.272 --> 00:22:30.252
I feel disconnected.

568
00:22:30.252 --> 00:22:31.761
Whatever it might be.

569
00:22:31.761 --> 00:22:33.141
<v ->[Woman interviewer] So, you tap as you talk?</v>

570
00:22:33.141 --> 00:22:33.712
<v ->Yeah.</v>

571
00:22:33.712 --> 00:22:34.802
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Okay, so you're acknowledging</v>

572
00:22:34.802 --> 00:22:35.501
the wound.

573
00:22:35.501 --> 00:22:37.971
<v ->Yeah, and because you're acknowledging the wound</v>

574
00:22:37.971 --> 00:22:39.071
the wound changes.

575
00:22:39.071 --> 00:22:39.942
It shifts.

576
00:22:39.942 --> 00:22:40.611
It changes.

577
00:22:40.611 --> 00:22:41.212
<v ->[Woman interviewer] It's not hiding in the</v>

578
00:22:41.212 --> 00:22:41.931
shadows anymore.

579
00:22:41.931 --> 00:22:42.952
<v ->No, it's not hiding in the shadows.</v>

580
00:22:42.952 --> 00:22:44.901
you have to bring the shadows forth.

581
00:22:44.901 --> 00:22:48.721
And the advantage of realizing my being so empathic

582
00:22:48.721 --> 00:22:52.271
is sometimes they're not getting the words they need to say

583
00:22:52.271 --> 00:22:54.631
'cause we're unconscious.

584
00:22:54.631 --> 00:22:55.672
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Right.</v>

585
00:22:55.672 --> 00:22:59.351
<v ->In working so long as a therapist I found we lie more</v>

586
00:22:59.351 --> 00:23:00.631
to ourselves than anyone else.

587
00:23:00.631 --> 00:23:01.361
<v ->[Woman interviewer] That is very true.</v>

588
00:23:01.361 --> 00:23:01.832
(Helaine chuckles)

589
00:23:01.832 --> 00:23:03.991
Okay, so now, we've acknowledged the wound, the shadow's

590
00:23:03.991 --> 00:23:06.661
out of the closet, and now, you start reinforcing.

591
00:23:06.661 --> 00:23:08.851
<v ->And then, you begin reinforcing the positive.</v>

592
00:23:09.861 --> 00:23:11.452
I want to feel more love.

593
00:23:11.452 --> 00:23:12.932
I do feel more love.

594
00:23:12.932 --> 00:23:14.352
I'm beginning to feel more love.

595
00:23:14.352 --> 00:23:16.381
I want more love in my life.

596
00:23:16.381 --> 00:23:18.531
I'm beginning to feel more love.

597
00:23:18.531 --> 00:23:20.582
I can feel love when I'm alone.

598
00:23:20.582 --> 00:23:22.662
Spirit loves me, you know.

599
00:23:22.662 --> 00:23:24.651
I'm feeling more love right now.

600
00:23:24.651 --> 00:23:26.621
That's why I like working so much with guides.

601
00:23:26.621 --> 00:23:29.051
You call in those guides, and they pour the love

602
00:23:29.051 --> 00:23:30.111
into the people.

603
00:23:30.111 --> 00:23:30.781
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Yes.</v>

604
00:23:30.781 --> 00:23:32.211
<v ->And I'm doing it too.</v>

605
00:23:32.211 --> 00:23:33.501
But I have a lot of help.

606
00:23:33.501 --> 00:23:34.561
I can't do this.

607
00:23:34.561 --> 00:23:36.852
I work with a whole team, and I know it.

608
00:23:36.852 --> 00:23:38.171
They're just not visible.

609
00:23:38.171 --> 00:23:39.271
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Yes.</v>

610
00:23:39.271 --> 00:23:42.611
<v ->And so, when I ask, and they're asking, that's why I have</v>

611
00:23:42.611 --> 00:23:45.031
them ask because they have to give permission to their

612
00:23:45.031 --> 00:23:47.951
inner guides to work with them, or they won't do it.

613
00:23:47.951 --> 00:23:48.871
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Yes.</v>

614
00:23:48.871 --> 00:23:50.201
<v ->They actually sit outside and wait.</v>

615
00:23:50.201 --> 00:23:54.521
So, by doing that, they just pour love into them.

616
00:23:55.741 --> 00:23:57.111
<v ->[Woman interviewer] And you actually do.</v>

617
00:23:57.111 --> 00:23:59.462
I've used EFT before.

618
00:23:59.462 --> 00:24:02.521
You actually do begin feeling the effects virtually

619
00:24:02.521 --> 00:24:03.531
immediately.

620
00:24:03.531 --> 00:24:04.681
<v ->Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

621
00:24:04.681 --> 00:24:05.872
<v ->[Woman interviewer] The energy starts shifting.</v>

622
00:24:05.872 --> 00:24:06.641
<v ->Right.</v>

623
00:24:06.641 --> 00:24:10.391
And it just, when I had three people in one week, including

624
00:24:10.391 --> 00:24:14.731
someone who is pushed into

625
00:24:16.101 --> 00:24:19.642
trafficking, prostitution, at like 13, 14.

626
00:24:19.642 --> 00:24:22.331
That kind of level of work is what I've been doing.

627
00:24:22.331 --> 00:24:24.861
So, when I work with someone like that, and I've had three

628
00:24:24.861 --> 00:24:26.951
people in one week tell me they've felt more love than

629
00:24:26.951 --> 00:24:29.831
they've felt in their entire life, including family

630
00:24:29.831 --> 00:24:31.811
of origins, and anyone.

631
00:24:31.811 --> 00:24:32.451
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Yes.</v>

632
00:24:32.451 --> 00:24:33.221
<v ->I said, okay.</v>

633
00:24:33.221 --> 00:24:34.591
That's what I'm supposed to be doing.

634
00:24:34.591 --> 00:24:35.091
(Helaine chuckles)

635
00:24:35.091 --> 00:24:35.691
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Absolutely.</v>

636
00:24:35.691 --> 00:24:36.272
You are.

637
00:24:36.272 --> 00:24:37.222
<v ->It's like I love it.</v>

638
00:24:37.222 --> 00:24:39.721
'Cause I'm a joy at the end of a session then.

639
00:24:39.721 --> 00:24:40.581
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Absolutely.</v>

640
00:24:40.581 --> 00:24:43.051
And are you using EFT in most of the sessions with people?

641
00:24:43.051 --> 00:24:44.222
Is that one of your
<v Helaine>Often, yeah.</v>

642
00:24:44.222 --> 00:24:45.761
most common modalities?

643
00:24:45.761 --> 00:24:47.992
<v ->Because it's safer than to do it by themselves.</v>

644
00:24:47.992 --> 00:24:48.611
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Yes.</v>

645
00:24:48.611 --> 00:24:49.432
<v ->Not, some of them are.</v>

646
00:24:49.432 --> 00:24:52.111
And I use EMDR and hypnosis, and reiki work,

647
00:24:52.111 --> 00:24:53.411
and many other things.

648
00:24:53.411 --> 00:24:56.281
But I look for things they can do by themselves, you know.

649
00:24:56.281 --> 00:24:58.051
I started as a teacher.

650
00:24:58.051 --> 00:25:00.242
So, I want to teach.

651
00:25:00.242 --> 00:25:01.692
So, I teach.

652
00:25:01.692 --> 00:25:03.371
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Well, you're doing a lovely job,</v>

653
00:25:03.371 --> 00:25:04.581
and I saw the people in the audience.

654
00:25:04.581 --> 00:25:08.532
And one of the things that really struck me were it's really

655
00:25:08.532 --> 00:25:11.631
more the men than the women, oftentimes, who are struggling

656
00:25:11.631 --> 00:25:14.761
to find this place of piece inside, and women too.

657
00:25:14.761 --> 00:25:15.862
I mean, it's both.

658
00:25:15.862 --> 00:25:18.731
And I see that they resonate with the spark in you.

659
00:25:18.731 --> 00:25:20.982
And I really appreciate your taking the time

660
00:25:20.982 --> 00:25:22.191
to spend with us today.

661
00:25:22.191 --> 00:25:23.201
<v ->Thank you very much.</v>

662
00:25:23.201 --> 00:25:23.962
<v ->[Woman interviewer] Thank you, Helaine.</v>

663
00:25:23.962 --> 00:25:24.582
<v ->Thank you.</v>

664
00:25:26.052 --> 00:25:30.011
<v ->You can go to Helaine's website at hzharris.com to learn</v>

665
00:25:30.011 --> 00:25:32.491
more about her work and read her articles on

666
00:25:32.491 --> 00:25:35.781
Energy Vampires, the Art of Surrender, and much more.

667
00:25:35.781 --> 00:25:38.041
For more on EFT, you might also enjoy our interview

668
00:25:38.041 --> 00:25:39.432
with Phillip Mountrose.

669
00:25:39.432 --> 00:25:42.302
I think you might also resonate with Donna Eden as well.

670
00:25:42.302 --> 00:25:43.271
Until next time.

671
00:25:43.271 --> 00:25:45.021
Thanks for watching CMN.

672
00:25:45.021 --> 00:25:49.940
(electronic vibrations)
