00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:02.688
<v ->This is a story of compassion.</v>

2
00:00:02.688 --> 00:00:05.991
Andre Smith is an anger management coach for prisoners.

3
00:00:05.991 --> 00:00:08.026
One of his most stressed messages

4
00:00:08.026 --> 00:00:09.660
is that of practicing compassion.

5
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.797
Not only for others, but for ourselves,

6
00:00:11.797 --> 00:00:13.332
no matter what we've done in life.

7
00:00:13.332 --> 00:00:15.200
Little did he know that his own beliefs

8
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.805
were to be severely challenged

9
00:00:16.805 --> 00:00:19.137
in an event that changed his family forever

10
00:00:19.137 --> 00:00:20.672
through a violent act.

11
00:00:20.672 --> 00:00:22.907
In spite of this, Andre takes great joy

12
00:00:22.907 --> 00:00:25.410
in seeing the lights go on in the minds of those

13
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.813
the rest of the world have thrown away.

14
00:00:27.813 --> 00:00:32.797 line:15% 
(gentle piano music)

15
00:00:37.323 --> 00:00:40.542
Andre, you're an amazing person,

16
00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:42.194
but this didn't happen by accident.

17
00:00:42.194 --> 00:00:44.863
You've taken the time to literally

18
00:00:44.863 --> 00:00:46.931
practice and train your mind

19
00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:50.502
and train your emotions through your Buddhist practices.

20
00:00:50.502 --> 00:00:52.638
And this something that came into play

21
00:00:52.638 --> 00:00:55.642
very personally for you very recently.

22
00:00:55.642 --> 00:00:58.910
Less than a year ago, you were challenged,

23
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.545
even with your background in dealing

24
00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:03.148
with prisoners in anger management and meditation,

25
00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:05.417
you were challenged very personally and deeply

26
00:01:05.417 --> 00:01:07.853
when you son was killed.

27
00:01:09.693 --> 00:01:12.691
Out on a night on the town at a nightclub.

28
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:14.859
Can you talk a little bit about what happened

29
00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:17.028
and what your response was to this?

30
00:01:17.028 --> 00:01:18.863
Because it wasn't a normal response

31
00:01:18.863 --> 00:01:20.966
that most people would have.

32
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.501
<v ->Yeah, sure.</v>

33
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:24.636
It's not something that you expect.

34
00:01:24.636 --> 00:01:27.282
You know, for one thing,

35
00:01:27.282 --> 00:01:30.875
my son is going out as he does

36
00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:34.846
to a nightclub to enjoy himself.

37
00:01:34.846 --> 00:01:39.685
And it's always the same exchange.

38
00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:41.653
"Pop, I'm going out."

39
00:01:41.653 --> 00:01:46.378
And then I say, "OK, be safe."

40
00:01:46.378 --> 00:01:49.868
And then "I love you, Pop."

41
00:01:49.868 --> 00:01:50.862
"I love you, too."

42
00:01:50.862 --> 00:01:52.920
And then he comes back.

43
00:01:54.198 --> 00:01:55.701
This time he didn't come back.

44
00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:57.338
Instead it was a knock on the door.

45
00:01:57.338 --> 00:01:59.304
A very loud knock on the door.

46
00:01:59.304 --> 00:02:00.572
The doorbell was ringing and I guess

47
00:02:00.572 --> 00:02:02.307
it must have been, maybe about six o'clock

48
00:02:02.307 --> 00:02:05.510
in the morning or so, not quite sure of the time.

49
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.246
And then there was a detective.

50
00:02:08.246 --> 00:02:10.883
He gave us the news that our son was dead.

51
00:02:10.883 --> 00:02:12.451
Of course it just knocked us off our feet,

52
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:14.953
my wife and I and my daughter,

53
00:02:14.953 --> 00:02:17.639
and actually, take that back, my daughter

54
00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.859
she came down later and we told her.

55
00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.559
But it totally knocked us off our feet.

56
00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.317
And so, didn't really know how to respond at that time.

57
00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.371
In fact I remember being asked

58
00:02:33.371 --> 00:02:37.789
not so long ago by one of the prisoners that I teach.

59
00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:40.579
I was talking about compassion

60
00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.380
and forgiveness and he's saying

61
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.416
"Are you saying that we're supposed to forgive

62
00:02:44.416 --> 00:02:49.304
"And have compassion for a person

63
00:02:49.304 --> 00:02:52.441
"Who has killed or harmed,

64
00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:56.121
"Or even threatened

65
00:02:56.121 --> 00:02:59.131
"My wife or my child?"

66
00:02:59.131 --> 00:03:01.333
And I said, that's what I'm saying.

67
00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:03.635
Whether I'll be able to pull it off,

68
00:03:03.635 --> 00:03:05.340
I don't know whether I can do that.

69
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.438
I've never been faced with that situation.

70
00:03:07.438 --> 00:03:10.225
But I said, that's how I would like to be.

71
00:03:10.225 --> 00:03:13.011
And I said, there's many examples

72
00:03:13.011 --> 00:03:16.514
of people in life, the Buddha, Jesus,

73
00:03:16.514 --> 00:03:19.740
Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Junior, Mother Theresa, others

74
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.711
who have been able to have this great compassion.

75
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:28.176
And so I said, I believe, therefore

76
00:03:28.176 --> 00:03:31.029
if they could do it, I can do it, too.

77
00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:33.601
And so, of course

78
00:03:35.631 --> 00:03:37.436
the opportunity came for me

79
00:03:37.436 --> 00:03:40.119
to see if it was really there or not.

80
00:03:41.472 --> 00:03:43.108
It was later on the day.

81
00:03:43.108 --> 00:03:47.079
We had to take care of things like

82
00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.483
getting the body, cremation,

83
00:03:50.483 --> 00:03:52.783
and so forth.

84
00:03:52.783 --> 00:03:55.316
And then we got back

85
00:03:55.316 --> 00:03:59.224
there was a local news station there.

86
00:03:59.224 --> 00:04:01.626
And she wanted to do an interview.

87
00:04:01.626 --> 00:04:04.662
Initially, I said no.

88
00:04:04.662 --> 00:04:06.998
The reason, because the media tends to

89
00:04:06.998 --> 00:04:08.600
sensationalize these things.

90
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.171
I didn't want my son's death to be about

91
00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:16.941
some sensational experience.

92
00:04:16.941 --> 00:04:20.611
So I said no

93
00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:24.950
and she assured me that she would honor my son

94
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.887
and she would be very tasteful and very respectful.

95
00:04:28.887 --> 00:04:31.690
And so then I trusted her and

96
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.258
so I did the interview.

97
00:04:33.258 --> 00:04:38.162
She asked how do I feel, what do I feel

98
00:04:38.162 --> 00:04:41.033
about the person who killed my son.

99
00:04:41.033 --> 00:04:43.001
Prior to that she asked how did I feel

100
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:46.004
and I said, well it just happened.

101
00:04:49.514 --> 00:04:51.102
It hurts.
<v Woman>Beyond numb.</v>

102
00:04:51.109 --> 00:04:55.497
<v Andre>Yeah, and so then she asked me</v>

103
00:04:55.497 --> 00:05:00.252
and I was surprised by the question,

104
00:05:00.252 --> 00:05:05.227
"How do you feel towards this guy?"

105
00:05:05.227 --> 00:05:07.753
And without hesitation

106
00:05:07.753 --> 00:05:09.994
I have compassion for him.

107
00:05:09.994 --> 00:05:13.398
And she, well

108
00:05:13.398 --> 00:05:16.368
how can you have compassion for him?

109
00:05:16.368 --> 00:05:18.587
And I said well, because,

110
00:05:18.587 --> 00:05:21.606
the moment that he plunged the knife

111
00:05:21.606 --> 00:05:25.377
into my son's chest and murdered my son,

112
00:05:25.377 --> 00:05:30.376
it was at that moment he began to suffer.

113
00:05:30.376 --> 00:05:34.119
And how can you not have compassion

114
00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:36.888
for someone who is suffering?

115
00:05:36.888 --> 00:05:40.325
And so from there it began.

116
00:05:40.325 --> 00:05:45.320
I realized that I have the capacity

117
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.201
to have compassion and the capacity to forgive.

118
00:05:49.201 --> 00:05:51.336
It's always there and I think

119
00:05:51.336 --> 00:05:54.305
it's there in each and every one of us.

120
00:05:54.305 --> 00:05:56.441
It's just that we aren't aware of it.

121
00:05:56.441 --> 00:06:01.124
And we aren't practicing these things.

122
00:06:01.814 --> 00:06:03.482
<v Woman>What's interesting about this</v>

123
00:06:03.482 --> 00:06:05.617
is a lot of people would hear that,

124
00:06:05.617 --> 00:06:08.116
watching that news report that night,

125
00:06:08.116 --> 00:06:11.237
and say "I'd kill the guy

126
00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:13.507
"If I were in his situation,

127
00:06:13.507 --> 00:06:15.092
"I'd want to kill him." and so forth.

128
00:06:15.092 --> 00:06:20.068
And oddly, it's those feelings that people call

129
00:06:20.068 --> 00:06:23.535
that they call, well it's part of being human

130
00:06:23.535 --> 00:06:26.271
to feel like this, that's what humanity

131
00:06:26.271 --> 00:06:28.072
is and does and feels.

132
00:06:28.072 --> 00:06:30.610
But isn't there something terribly distorted

133
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.343
about the perception that only anger

134
00:06:32.343 --> 00:06:36.248
and the lowest emotions are, in effect, who we are?

135
00:06:36.248 --> 00:06:37.549
<v ->Yeah, I find it very curious</v>

136
00:06:37.549 --> 00:06:41.619
that people feel that to have compassion,

137
00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:44.789
to have forgiveness is not the way

138
00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:46.757
that we should naturally be.

139
00:06:46.757 --> 00:06:50.362
Rather, we should naturally want

140
00:06:50.362 --> 00:06:53.565
to get the guy back or take revenge

141
00:06:53.565 --> 00:06:55.900
or to have anger or to have hate.

142
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.070
As if that's a normal way of being.

143
00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.772
And sadly, it is the normal way

144
00:07:00.772 --> 00:07:03.208
of being for most of us.

145
00:07:03.208 --> 00:07:07.615
But it's not the way to be, right.

146
00:07:07.615 --> 00:07:09.447
<v Woman>Now this is very fresh.</v>

147
00:07:09.447 --> 00:07:11.416
I mean, the trial just wrapped up

148
00:07:11.416 --> 00:07:14.419
a few weeks ago as I understand

149
00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:17.221
and you did have a chance to, at the end

150
00:07:17.221 --> 00:07:20.592
after everybody avoiding you, avoiding your eyes

151
00:07:20.592 --> 00:07:23.528
I was listening to to your rendering of that experience

152
00:07:23.528 --> 00:07:26.564
where nobody looks at the victim's family.

153
00:07:26.564 --> 00:07:28.632
It's just this disconnected thing

154
00:07:28.632 --> 00:07:31.569
where you're watching your life being talked about.

155
00:07:31.569 --> 00:07:34.338
And in the end you had a chance to

156
00:07:34.338 --> 00:07:38.310
look into the eyes of the man who did this.

157
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.645
And also his family?

158
00:07:40.645 --> 00:07:41.479
<v ->Right, yes</v>

159
00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:43.448
<v Woman>And what was that experience like?</v>

160
00:07:43.448 --> 00:07:45.116
What did you have to say to them?

161
00:07:45.116 --> 00:07:46.360
<v ->Well, I ...</v>

162
00:07:51.222 --> 00:07:54.259
Let me say, too, that that was something

163
00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:57.295
my wife and even my daughter was questioning

164
00:07:57.295 --> 00:07:59.654
whether I should do it.

165
00:07:59.654 --> 00:08:03.314
My daughter felt that I shouldn't do it.

166
00:08:03.314 --> 00:08:07.138
That this guy didn't need kind words.

167
00:08:07.138 --> 00:08:09.740
My wife felt that it would perhaps

168
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.510
fall on deaf ears and so maybe

169
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.445
it would be wasted words, but it's

170
00:08:13.445 --> 00:08:15.713
something I felt compelled to do.

171
00:08:15.713 --> 00:08:17.148
<v Woman>And your daughter was partially angry,</v>

172
00:08:17.148 --> 00:08:19.417
as you said earlier today, because it was

173
00:08:19.417 --> 00:08:20.952
reduced to second degree murder

174
00:08:20.952 --> 00:08:24.175
and she felt he should have got the full treatment.

175
00:08:24.175 --> 00:08:25.823
<v ->Right, yeah.</v>

176
00:08:25.823 --> 00:08:27.425
And to be honest, I felt, too.

177
00:08:27.425 --> 00:08:32.363
Because it was hinged on intent

178
00:08:32.363 --> 00:08:35.534
and intent is something that's hard to prove.

179
00:08:35.534 --> 00:08:36.501
<v Woman>It is hard to prove.</v>

180
00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:39.404
You're drunk and whooping it up and angry

181
00:08:39.404 --> 00:08:40.938
and I guess they can always argue

182
00:08:40.938 --> 00:08:42.474
you're not in your total mind.

183
00:08:42.474 --> 00:08:45.209
But in any event, you chose to

184
00:08:45.209 --> 00:08:46.604
speak to

185
00:08:46.604 --> 00:08:48.943
<v ->I did, and so</v>

186
00:08:48.943 --> 00:08:51.682
I saw this as my opportunity to be able

187
00:08:51.682 --> 00:08:54.886
to share with them how I felt.

188
00:08:54.886 --> 00:08:56.788
And to share with them

189
00:08:56.788 --> 00:09:01.159
what I would like for him.

190
00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:04.495
My wish for him was to have happiness

191
00:09:04.495 --> 00:09:05.929
and to be free of suffering.

192
00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:07.299
I told him this and I called him

193
00:09:07.299 --> 00:09:09.434
by his name, Wallace.

194
00:09:09.434 --> 00:09:12.736
And I told him

195
00:09:12.736 --> 00:09:15.073
from a Buddhist perspective

196
00:09:15.073 --> 00:09:19.798
love means that we want you to have happiness.

197
00:09:19.798 --> 00:09:22.647
I want you to have happiness, compassion.

198
00:09:22.647 --> 00:09:24.648
I don't want you to suffer.

199
00:09:24.648 --> 00:09:26.985
And so I said I have love and compassion for you.

200
00:09:26.985 --> 00:09:28.786
I told him that from the moment that I found out

201
00:09:28.786 --> 00:09:31.956
that he killed my son I had compassion.

202
00:09:31.956 --> 00:09:35.594
That hasn't changed from all these months

203
00:09:35.594 --> 00:09:38.196
and the sweep of the trial,

204
00:09:38.196 --> 00:09:39.263
that hasn't changed.

205
00:09:39.263 --> 00:09:40.565
I still have love and I still have

206
00:09:40.565 --> 00:09:42.267
compassion for you, Wallace.

207
00:09:42.267 --> 00:09:45.637
But I said that, and explained to him again what that meant.

208
00:09:45.637 --> 00:09:49.273
But I said, you won't have this.

209
00:09:49.273 --> 00:09:51.876
You won't have freedom from suffering

210
00:09:51.876 --> 00:09:56.614
as long as you have this mind that is filled with anger

211
00:09:56.614 --> 00:09:58.016
and filled with hate and as long as you're

212
00:09:58.016 --> 00:10:00.485
putting the blame somewhere else.

213
00:10:00.485 --> 00:10:01.652
I told him that he has to be able to

214
00:10:01.652 --> 00:10:02.954
look at himself and realize that

215
00:10:02.954 --> 00:10:04.188
"I did this."

216
00:10:04.188 --> 00:10:06.224
"I take responsibility for this

217
00:10:06.224 --> 00:10:10.729
"And I really regret, deeply, what I've done."

218
00:10:10.729 --> 00:10:13.398
And then I said when you can do that,

219
00:10:13.398 --> 00:10:15.933
then you will be free.

220
00:10:15.933 --> 00:10:17.868
And then you will be able to experience that.

221
00:10:17.868 --> 00:10:21.138
Until you do that, you will continue to cause suffering.

222
00:10:21.138 --> 00:10:22.539
Not only for yourself, but suffering

223
00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:27.163
for your family, suffering for another's family.

224
00:10:28.345 --> 00:10:29.747
<v Woman>And just to put a little tiny bit of</v>

225
00:10:29.747 --> 00:10:32.950
a thumbnail's worth of perspective on it,

226
00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:35.586
they were at a nightclub and your son was dancing,

227
00:10:35.586 --> 00:10:36.987
doing the mosh pit thing

228
00:10:36.987 --> 00:10:39.858
and as he was exuberant in his dancing activities

229
00:10:39.858 --> 00:10:42.227
he accidentally spilled this man's beer

230
00:10:42.227 --> 00:10:44.595
and that's what precipitated this entire event.

231
00:10:44.595 --> 00:10:47.065
So that's a deep, deep degree of rage

232
00:10:47.065 --> 00:10:49.300
to respond in such a way to this.

233
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.270
So this is not something you're unfamiliar with.

234
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.574
You're dealing with people all the time

235
00:10:55.574 --> 00:10:58.176
that are incarcerated, the people that

236
00:10:58.176 --> 00:11:02.747
society has basically tossed aside behind bars.

237
00:11:02.747 --> 00:11:07.568
And you teach them how to

238
00:11:07.568 --> 00:11:10.354
deal with their anger and also how to

239
00:11:10.354 --> 00:11:12.657
meditate, the practice of meditation.

240
00:11:12.657 --> 00:11:14.959
What I'd like to know is a few things.

241
00:11:14.959 --> 00:11:17.328
First of all, how is it determined

242
00:11:17.328 --> 00:11:19.530
which people you will be working with?

243
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:20.865
Do they request this?

244
00:11:20.865 --> 00:11:22.333
<v ->Yeah, they volunteer for it.</v>

245
00:11:22.333 --> 00:11:23.801
<v Woman>They volunteer. And then once you</v>

246
00:11:23.801 --> 00:11:25.602
meet with them, what do you find are

247
00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:29.274
some of the biggest factors that you have to

248
00:11:29.274 --> 00:11:32.477
get past in them in terms of their own

249
00:11:32.477 --> 00:11:36.981
rage and feelings of maybe even self-hatred and so forth?

250
00:11:36.981 --> 00:11:40.708
<v ->Sometimes it's that</v>

251
00:11:40.708 --> 00:11:44.522
they're still in this blaming mode.

252
00:11:44.522 --> 00:11:46.291
But most of them have moved beyond that now.

253
00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:48.393
They've been there for a while.

254
00:11:48.393 --> 00:11:50.895
They're repeat offenders, many of them.

255
00:11:50.895 --> 00:11:53.731
And so finally, they've come to realize

256
00:11:53.731 --> 00:11:56.134
that it's because of their actions

257
00:11:56.134 --> 00:11:59.537
that they're where they are now.

258
00:11:59.537 --> 00:12:00.371
<v Woman>Big step.</v>

259
00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:01.706
<v ->It's a very big step.</v>

260
00:12:01.706 --> 00:12:03.475
And so therefore, they volunteer for

261
00:12:03.475 --> 00:12:06.077
a class like mine because now they're

262
00:12:06.077 --> 00:12:09.447
looking for a way to change the way they think

263
00:12:09.447 --> 00:12:11.549
and the way they behaved.

264
00:12:11.549 --> 00:12:14.152
So that's one thing.

265
00:12:14.152 --> 00:12:16.721
And if you could repeat the other part?

266
00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:20.992
<v Woman>So, well let me retrace my own steps here.</v>

267
00:12:20.992 --> 00:12:24.295
When you're working with them and you

268
00:12:24.295 --> 00:12:25.663
begin work with them,

269
00:12:25.663 --> 00:12:30.068
what are some of the initial obstacles that you face?

270
00:12:30.068 --> 00:12:31.168
Even though they've said,

271
00:12:31.168 --> 00:12:34.605
"Look I know I'm here because I've done these things"

272
00:12:34.605 --> 00:12:36.440
but what are some of the very first obstacles

273
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:40.010
from deep within that you find in working with them?

274
00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.913
<v ->Motivated by fear, most of them motivated</v>

275
00:12:42.913 --> 00:12:46.718
by fear and misperception.

276
00:12:46.718 --> 00:12:49.386
Wallace Vass, who killed my son,

277
00:12:49.386 --> 00:12:52.022
was motivated by fear and misperception.

278
00:12:52.022 --> 00:12:53.757
He perceived Daniel to be a threat

279
00:12:53.757 --> 00:12:55.760
although Daniel wasn't a threat.

280
00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.096
And because of that he had this fear.

281
00:12:58.096 --> 00:13:00.965
It's kind of like the fight and flight response.

282
00:13:00.965 --> 00:13:02.900
I liked today when the one guy was

283
00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.469
talking about fight, flight, there's a third option.

284
00:13:05.469 --> 00:13:06.670
Stay put.

285
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.138
<v Woman>Stay put. That dance.</v>

286
00:13:08.138 --> 00:13:09.645
<v ->Yeah, that dance, that's right, yeah.</v>

287
00:13:09.645 --> 00:13:11.042
And so he's motivated by fear and

288
00:13:11.042 --> 00:13:13.478
so most of them, they're still in that mode.

289
00:13:13.478 --> 00:13:16.113
Where they still have these fears.

290
00:13:16.113 --> 00:13:20.251
And it really causes them to see things

291
00:13:20.251 --> 00:13:21.319
not as they really are,

292
00:13:21.319 --> 00:13:25.884
but see things distortedly,

293
00:13:25.884 --> 00:13:28.058
which will always get you in trouble.

294
00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:29.860
So that's the thing.

295
00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.096
Then, another obstacle is just the

296
00:13:32.096 --> 00:13:34.398
inability to forgive themselves.

297
00:13:34.398 --> 00:13:35.499
They feel so bad.

298
00:13:35.499 --> 00:13:38.269
When they found out what was done to my son

299
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:42.607
and I came back the next week.

300
00:13:42.607 --> 00:13:45.809
We didn't do a regular class but we just sat.

301
00:13:45.809 --> 00:13:48.445
And I asked them, if there's anything you want to ask,

302
00:13:48.445 --> 00:13:50.147
if there's anything you want to share,

303
00:13:50.147 --> 00:13:51.182
just do so.

304
00:13:51.182 --> 00:13:55.620
It took a little bit of time but they began to open up.

305
00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:00.615
First of all, they expressed their compassion

306
00:14:00.615 --> 00:14:04.895
and their feelings of "I'm sorry."

307
00:14:04.895 --> 00:14:07.331
And then they were really moved by the fact

308
00:14:07.331 --> 00:14:09.701
that I was able to forgive this guy.

309
00:14:09.701 --> 00:14:11.035
They had never experienced that before.

310
00:14:11.035 --> 00:14:14.238
People often talk the talk, but they don't walk the walk.

311
00:14:14.238 --> 00:14:17.341
So they saw, and what they're all looking for,

312
00:14:17.341 --> 00:14:18.943
especially this population,

313
00:14:18.943 --> 00:14:20.779
they're looking for authenticity.

314
00:14:20.779 --> 00:14:23.981
They're looking for people who really live it.

315
00:14:23.981 --> 00:14:27.151
And so that's what they saw.

316
00:14:27.151 --> 00:14:31.122
And so for many of them, that was

317
00:14:31.122 --> 00:14:32.723
the beginning of the healing process for them.

318
00:14:32.723 --> 00:14:35.192
Because I was able to forgive,

319
00:14:35.192 --> 00:14:37.127
they were able to begin to look at themselves,

320
00:14:37.127 --> 00:14:39.164
begin to forgive themselves.

321
00:14:39.164 --> 00:14:42.100
It really hit home and became very real to them

322
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.868
why they're doing what they're doing,

323
00:14:43.868 --> 00:14:46.437
why they're in this class and so forth.

324
00:14:46.437 --> 00:14:48.038
And so at that point they

325
00:14:48.038 --> 00:14:51.388
really commit themselves even more to the class.

326
00:14:51.388 --> 00:14:53.711
<v Woman>What an amazing gift to them</v>

327
00:14:53.711 --> 00:14:55.179
for you to come in and say

328
00:14:55.179 --> 00:14:58.982
"I feel genuine compassion for this person

329
00:14:58.982 --> 00:15:02.186
"That has caused our family this great deal of pain."

330
00:15:02.186 --> 00:15:03.755
And for them to see then they're

331
00:15:03.755 --> 00:15:07.591
worthy of the same, of this compassion.

332
00:15:07.591 --> 00:15:09.193
Would you say that in most cases

333
00:15:09.193 --> 00:15:11.161
the people that end up in prison

334
00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:13.464
have not been shown a lot of compassion?

335
00:15:13.464 --> 00:15:14.902
<v ->Yeah, that's true.</v>

336
00:15:14.902 --> 00:15:15.933
<v Woman>In their own lives?</v>

337
00:15:15.933 --> 00:15:17.000
<v ->Yeah, they're damaged people</v>

338
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.958
as we all are, we've all been damaged in some way.

339
00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.985
And they've been

340
00:15:22.985 --> 00:15:25.925
abused by their parents,

341
00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:28.312
abandoned by their parents, many of them,

342
00:15:28.312 --> 00:15:30.048
haven't been shown love.

343
00:15:30.048 --> 00:15:31.382
So therefore they don't know really

344
00:15:31.382 --> 00:15:32.717
how to give love.

345
00:15:32.717 --> 00:15:35.820
I always tell them that inside them

346
00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.354
there's this innate goodness.

347
00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:41.760
Buddhists, we call it Buddha nature.

348
00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.701
A Christian may call it the Christ self.

349
00:15:44.701 --> 00:15:49.701
But we all have this innate goodness.

350
00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:54.171
But we have to recognize that it's there

351
00:15:54.171 --> 00:15:56.040
and then we have to begin the work

352
00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.475
which is peeling away the layers.

353
00:15:58.475 --> 00:15:59.911
We have so many layers because

354
00:15:59.911 --> 00:16:01.312
all the time, from the very beginning

355
00:16:01.312 --> 00:16:02.680
when we learned how to speak

356
00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.315
someone told us, perhaps,

357
00:16:04.315 --> 00:16:07.751
"Shut up" and so then

358
00:16:07.751 --> 00:16:10.689
we stopped speaking and there's a layer.

359
00:16:10.689 --> 00:16:15.619
And then the first time we reach out to a girl

360
00:16:15.619 --> 00:16:18.796
and then she shuts the door on us.

361
00:16:18.796 --> 00:16:20.131
It's another layer.

362
00:16:20.131 --> 00:16:22.274
<v Woman>Rejection</v>
<v Andre>Rejection</v>

363
00:16:22.274 --> 00:16:24.100
<v Andre>And so another layer and a layer</v>

364
00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.205
and so by the time we become adults

365
00:16:27.205 --> 00:16:29.740
we have just layers and layers and layers

366
00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.726
covering up this nugget of goodness.

367
00:16:32.726 --> 00:16:34.278
<v Woman>So we're not so vulnerable to the pain.</v>

368
00:16:34.278 --> 00:16:36.914
<v ->So we're not so vulnerable, absolutely, yeah.</v>

369
00:16:36.914 --> 00:16:38.649
So I tell them it takes courage

370
00:16:38.649 --> 00:16:41.052
but we have to begin to peel away the layers

371
00:16:41.052 --> 00:16:43.321
because it means we have to begin to trust.

372
00:16:43.321 --> 00:16:46.212
And we may get rejection, we may get rejection.

373
00:16:46.212 --> 00:16:48.659
but then we say, that's ok.

374
00:16:48.659 --> 00:16:51.662
Because it's not about what we get back

375
00:16:51.662 --> 00:16:52.964
but it's what we give.

376
00:16:52.964 --> 00:16:55.031
And so we open up and we open up

377
00:16:55.031 --> 00:16:58.401
until finally that nugget of goodness is there.

378
00:16:58.401 --> 00:17:01.605
And then we begin to allow that to become who we are.

379
00:17:01.605 --> 00:17:04.342
<v Woman>Can you tell us and share a couple of examples</v>

380
00:17:04.342 --> 00:17:05.810
of people that you've dealt with in prison

381
00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.078
that have had a pretty tough go of it

382
00:17:08.078 --> 00:17:09.381
in their lives that have landed them

383
00:17:09.381 --> 00:17:12.449
into a life that has led to their incarceration?

384
00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:14.185
And you're working with them,

385
00:17:14.185 --> 00:17:15.920
what has transpired for them?

386
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.421
I love to hear these.

387
00:17:17.421 --> 00:17:22.359
<v ->Yeah, right, well I'll never forget this one young man.</v>

388
00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:23.828
And he was a young man.

389
00:17:23.828 --> 00:17:28.828
He-- although they always look older than their age.

390
00:17:28.833 --> 00:17:31.168
Prison life is tough life and

391
00:17:31.168 --> 00:17:34.481
their life prior to prison life is tough life.

392
00:17:34.481 --> 00:17:39.481
I was talking about Buddhist psychology

393
00:17:39.843 --> 00:17:41.946
and how it is working on the mind.

394
00:17:41.946 --> 00:17:44.314
And I always say in order to be

395
00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:46.417
a loving, kind, compassionate person

396
00:17:46.417 --> 00:17:48.818
you have to have loving, kind, compassionate thoughts.

397
00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:50.654
To be an angry person, you have to

398
00:17:50.654 --> 00:17:53.022
have angry thoughts, hateful thoughts and so forth.

399
00:17:53.022 --> 00:17:57.381
So what we put in is what comes out.

400
00:17:57.381 --> 00:18:02.376
So I remember this guy, two questions he asked.

401
00:18:02.376 --> 00:18:06.103
He said "Are you saying that it's all about the mind?"

402
00:18:06.103 --> 00:18:08.572
I said absolutely, it's all about the mind.

403
00:18:08.572 --> 00:18:11.242
So we work on our minds and then

404
00:18:11.242 --> 00:18:13.878
change your mind we change your behavior.

405
00:18:13.878 --> 00:18:16.179
And then I was talking about how

406
00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:19.650
we can all change and I said change is slow.

407
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:21.318
It takes time and we didn't get the way

408
00:18:21.318 --> 00:18:23.686
we are overnight and we're not going to

409
00:18:23.686 --> 00:18:26.591
change overnight, either.

410
00:18:26.591 --> 00:18:28.760
It takes time, it takes work.

411
00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.263
But it's well worth the effort, you know.

412
00:18:32.263 --> 00:18:35.299
And so then he said

413
00:18:35.299 --> 00:18:39.403
"Are you saying that I can change?"

414
00:18:39.403 --> 00:18:41.839
I said absolutely you can change.

415
00:18:41.839 --> 00:18:45.042
Not only can you change, but you've already changed.

416
00:18:45.042 --> 00:18:46.944
For you to be at this point now

417
00:18:46.944 --> 00:18:48.913
and you ask me this question.

418
00:18:48.913 --> 00:18:49.947
There was a time when you would never

419
00:18:49.947 --> 00:18:51.081
ask that question.

420
00:18:51.081 --> 00:18:52.182
There was a time when you didn't even think

421
00:18:52.182 --> 00:18:54.651
that it was even a question to ask.

422
00:18:54.651 --> 00:18:57.222
But now you're at this point when you ask that question,

423
00:18:57.222 --> 00:18:59.056
means you're well on your way.

424
00:18:59.056 --> 00:19:01.374
So, and it really...

425
00:19:01.374 --> 00:19:04.227
<v Woman>What have you seen with the prisoners</v>

426
00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:05.429
that you've worked with?

427
00:19:05.429 --> 00:19:08.499
Have you seen real shifts
<v Andre>Absolutely.</v>

428
00:19:08.499 --> 00:19:11.168
<v Woman>in their levels of compassion, self-acceptance</v>

429
00:19:11.168 --> 00:19:12.236
<v ->Absolutely, yeah.</v>

430
00:19:12.236 --> 00:19:14.972
Usually they're looking a you when you come in

431
00:19:14.972 --> 00:19:17.915
and they're skeptical.

432
00:19:17.915 --> 00:19:18.843
<v Woman>They don't trust you?</v>

433
00:19:18.843 --> 00:19:19.677
<v ->They don't trust you.</v>

434
00:19:19.677 --> 00:19:22.146
They want to know what is your agenda.

435
00:19:22.146 --> 00:19:23.748
Why are you doing this?

436
00:19:23.748 --> 00:19:25.015
Oh, you're doing this because you're a goody-goody

437
00:19:25.015 --> 00:19:26.484
and not because you really care.

438
00:19:26.484 --> 00:19:28.686
What's your agenda.

439
00:19:28.686 --> 00:19:31.023
So that's the first barrier as a teacher

440
00:19:31.023 --> 00:19:33.609
we have to be able to go over,

441
00:19:33.609 --> 00:19:34.958
to be able to show to them.

442
00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:36.160
So I tell them my story.

443
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.495
I tell them my experiences with drugs,

444
00:19:38.495 --> 00:19:40.364
my experiences with crime,

445
00:19:40.364 --> 00:19:42.199
the things that I've experienced in my life.

446
00:19:42.199 --> 00:19:45.269
Rejection from my father, all these kinds of things.

447
00:19:45.269 --> 00:19:48.772
And so then if you tell them your story

448
00:19:48.772 --> 00:19:52.043
then they're more willing to tell you their story.

449
00:19:52.043 --> 00:19:53.711
And we all have stories.

450
00:19:53.711 --> 00:19:56.013
<v Woman>Well and like you said in your talk today</v>

451
00:19:56.013 --> 00:19:58.749
the difference between you and them in some cases

452
00:19:58.749 --> 00:19:59.784
is, they got caught.

453
00:19:59.784 --> 00:20:02.452
<v ->That's right, and I didn't.
<v Woman>Exactly.</v>

454
00:20:02.452 --> 00:20:04.457
<v Woman>So you're here so you're making it up</v>

455
00:20:04.457 --> 00:20:06.056
by helping
<v Andre>That's right, yeah.</v>

456
00:20:06.056 --> 00:20:08.425
<v Woman>Do some of these people, are some of them</v>

457
00:20:08.425 --> 00:20:10.761
able to get out, are they released from prison

458
00:20:10.761 --> 00:20:13.797
and then go on to help others in significant ways?

459
00:20:13.797 --> 00:20:15.599
<v ->Yeah I've had a few students who actually</v>

460
00:20:15.599 --> 00:20:19.504
they were able to, it's called a promotion

461
00:20:19.504 --> 00:20:22.331
and they'll move from--

462
00:20:22.331 --> 00:20:27.308
my prison, it's not maximum but it's

463
00:20:27.308 --> 00:20:29.996
what is it, you have minimum and

464
00:20:29.996 --> 00:20:31.649
then there's the next level.

465
00:20:31.649 --> 00:20:33.250
<v Woman>It's like a medium level security.</v>

466
00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.520
<v ->Yeah, medium security, and so</v>

467
00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:40.191
then they get promoted

468
00:20:40.191 --> 00:20:43.127
if they conduct themselves

469
00:20:43.127 --> 00:20:45.229
in ways in which they

470
00:20:45.229 --> 00:20:46.931
no longer get in trouble.

471
00:20:46.931 --> 00:20:48.531
They don't get points against them.

472
00:20:48.531 --> 00:20:52.269
And so they make it and they sat through my classes.

473
00:20:52.269 --> 00:20:55.572
And so then when they've been promoted

474
00:20:55.572 --> 00:20:58.108
and they go to a minimum security prison

475
00:20:58.108 --> 00:21:00.978
I continue to have contact with them.

476
00:21:00.978 --> 00:21:02.615
We write letters and so forth.

477
00:21:02.615 --> 00:21:05.148
And they let me know how much this class

478
00:21:05.148 --> 00:21:06.550
has really helped them.

479
00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:08.518
And they let me know

480
00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:10.954
that they're continuing the meditation.

481
00:21:10.954 --> 00:21:13.925
They're continuing working on their mind and so forth.

482
00:21:13.925 --> 00:21:16.193
And they'll say, "It's really difficult in this place

483
00:21:16.193 --> 00:21:20.498
"But I have the tools now and so I'm using those tools."

484
00:21:20.498 --> 00:21:24.034
<v Woman>And for you, as you're sharing with them</v>

485
00:21:24.034 --> 00:21:27.805
to be of service is a really critical part.

486
00:21:27.805 --> 00:21:30.374
I mean, first you say that to forgive is really

487
00:21:30.374 --> 00:21:31.775
critical to happiness.

488
00:21:31.775 --> 00:21:32.676
<v ->Right, yeah.</v>

489
00:21:32.676 --> 00:21:34.011
<v Woman>And one can understand that</v>

490
00:21:34.011 --> 00:21:35.895
because you're freed

491
00:21:35.895 --> 00:21:37.215
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

492
00:21:37.215 --> 00:21:38.382
<v Woman>by forgiving, you're freed.</v>

493
00:21:38.382 --> 00:21:39.616
It's not that you free someone else.

494
00:21:39.616 --> 00:21:41.008
<v ->That's right, yeah.</v>

495
00:21:41.008 --> 00:21:42.353
You're liberating yourself.

496
00:21:42.353 --> 00:21:43.520
<v Woman>You liberate yourself.</v>

497
00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.688
But then you say, to be of service is another

498
00:21:45.688 --> 00:21:47.156
major component to happiness

499
00:21:47.156 --> 00:21:51.077
and we're here at the happiness and its causes conference.

500
00:21:51.077 --> 00:21:54.364
<v ->That's right, yeah, and that's when you really</v>

501
00:21:54.364 --> 00:21:55.733
find the happiness.

502
00:21:55.733 --> 00:21:57.383
I believe that if I had just

503
00:21:57.383 --> 00:22:01.939
If I had anger towards Wallace Vass,

504
00:22:01.939 --> 00:22:03.374
if I continued with that anger,

505
00:22:03.374 --> 00:22:06.777
just held onto that, I would never find happiness.

506
00:22:06.777 --> 00:22:10.280
Because I would never have the strength

507
00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:13.550
or have the desire to go out and serve others.

508
00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:15.251
It would have crippled me.

509
00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:20.089
But once I was able to go back to school

510
00:22:20.089 --> 00:22:22.592
and teach the students that I teach,

511
00:22:22.592 --> 00:22:24.028
and go back to the prison

512
00:22:24.028 --> 00:22:25.929
and work with these,

513
00:22:25.929 --> 00:22:27.431
I didn't want to miss a day

514
00:22:27.431 --> 00:22:29.066
because I knew that that's where I was

515
00:22:29.066 --> 00:22:32.069
going to find happiness, by serving others.

516
00:22:32.069 --> 00:22:34.437
It brings me immense joy, immense pleasure

517
00:22:34.437 --> 00:22:35.739
to be able to do that.

518
00:22:35.739 --> 00:22:39.376
And so every day I don't have time

519
00:22:39.376 --> 00:22:40.843
to think about my own situation

520
00:22:40.843 --> 00:22:43.981
because there's someone else who's got a situation.

521
00:22:43.981 --> 00:22:45.116
It doesn't mean that I've forgotten

522
00:22:45.116 --> 00:22:46.650
that I have one.

523
00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:48.852
It's just that I'm not nursing it.

524
00:22:48.852 --> 00:22:51.622
It's still there, every day I think about Daniel.

525
00:22:51.622 --> 00:22:54.424
I miss him every day, I miss him profoundly.

526
00:22:54.424 --> 00:22:55.892
There's also, I believe that it does

527
00:22:55.892 --> 00:22:59.196
a dishonor to Daniel if I'm just sitting there

528
00:22:59.196 --> 00:23:02.438
just sitting in this

529
00:23:02.438 --> 00:23:04.335
<v Woman>Stew of self pity</v>
<v Andre>pool of misery</v>

530
00:23:04.335 --> 00:23:08.004
<v Andre>Yeah, he wouldn't want me to be that way.</v>

531
00:23:08.004 --> 00:23:09.563
I know he wouldn't want me to be that way.

532
00:23:09.563 --> 00:23:10.574
<v Woman>And that's not who you are, anyway.</v>

533
00:23:10.574 --> 00:23:11.742
<v ->That's not who I am.</v>

534
00:23:11.742 --> 00:23:13.444
<v Woman>Where does hope come into all of this</v>

535
00:23:13.444 --> 00:23:14.778
because I know there are a lot of different

536
00:23:14.778 --> 00:23:16.598
definitions of what hope means.

537
00:23:16.598 --> 00:23:19.116
And one way, some people say oh, not a good word.

538
00:23:19.116 --> 00:23:21.451
Having something unattainable dangling out there.

539
00:23:21.451 --> 00:23:23.686
But some things have happened as of late.

540
00:23:23.686 --> 00:23:26.122
The election of Barack Obama in the United States

541
00:23:26.122 --> 00:23:28.859
has created an environment of hope

542
00:23:28.859 --> 00:23:31.195
for people around the world.

543
00:23:31.195 --> 00:23:34.865
What do you see by way of the value of hope

544
00:23:34.865 --> 00:23:36.866
and how does this apply to people

545
00:23:36.866 --> 00:23:39.078
who are incarcerated, as well?

546
00:23:39.078 --> 00:23:41.238
Well you have to have the hope, first of all,

547
00:23:41.238 --> 00:23:42.939
that you can change.

548
00:23:42.939 --> 00:23:44.841
The belief and the hope, belief that you can change

549
00:23:44.841 --> 00:23:45.875
and hope that you can change.

550
00:23:45.875 --> 00:23:47.344
Because they don't know whether or not,

551
00:23:47.344 --> 00:23:49.546
because they're still in that environment and

552
00:23:49.546 --> 00:23:51.448
that's a pretty safe environment.

553
00:23:51.448 --> 00:23:54.717
They form cliques and everybody

554
00:23:54.717 --> 00:23:56.953
in this class, they've become very good friends

555
00:23:56.953 --> 00:23:58.821
but they have their own little gang, if you will.

556
00:23:58.821 --> 00:24:00.323
<v Woman>on the inside</v>

557
00:24:00.323 --> 00:24:02.526
<v ->Yeah, a gang of peacemakers.</v>

558
00:24:02.526 --> 00:24:04.228
Which is a really nice gang, you know.

559
00:24:04.228 --> 00:24:09.199
But they don't know, because we talk about triggers.

560
00:24:09.199 --> 00:24:12.435
And so we all have triggers.

561
00:24:12.435 --> 00:24:14.771
And in this environment with these people

562
00:24:14.771 --> 00:24:17.007
who are your friends and who understand

563
00:24:17.007 --> 00:24:18.309
where you coming from

564
00:24:18.309 --> 00:24:22.979
these triggers aren't being touched.

565
00:24:22.979 --> 00:24:26.382
Many of them have a fear of leaving

566
00:24:26.382 --> 00:24:29.052
this comfortable environment and going back out there

567
00:24:29.052 --> 00:24:31.722
because they don't know if they have it yet to be able to,

568
00:24:31.722 --> 00:24:35.692
if someone does the same thing they did before.

569
00:24:35.692 --> 00:24:37.026
If someone rejects them, if someone,

570
00:24:37.026 --> 00:24:42.026
they don't know if that trigger is gone.

571
00:24:42.432 --> 00:24:45.532
So they have to have the hope that

572
00:24:45.532 --> 00:24:48.305
they are at a place now.

573
00:24:48.305 --> 00:24:49.740
<v Woman>It almost sounds like you could use the word</v>

574
00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.710
hope, faith, belief almost interchangeably here.

575
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:53.776
<v ->I think you can.</v>

576
00:24:53.776 --> 00:24:56.345
<v Woman>And this seems to be a really critical part.</v>

577
00:24:56.345 --> 00:25:00.684
What would you say, from all of your wisdom

578
00:25:00.684 --> 00:25:03.487
you've gathered through this life-time journey.

579
00:25:03.487 --> 00:25:07.724
What would you say to people that feel stuck?

580
00:25:07.724 --> 00:25:11.027
They're incapable of really going beyond

581
00:25:11.027 --> 00:25:12.696
what they know of themself,

582
00:25:12.696 --> 00:25:14.330
they know themselves to be in this moment?

583
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:15.799
Because that's an awful lot of people.

584
00:25:15.799 --> 00:25:17.167
<v ->It is, yeah.</v>

585
00:25:17.167 --> 00:25:21.104
I would say that first of all, if you feel stuck

586
00:25:21.104 --> 00:25:24.007
you're the one that's sticking yourself.

587
00:25:24.007 --> 00:25:26.743
So you have to realize

588
00:25:26.743 --> 00:25:30.813
that you can get unstuck.

589
00:25:30.813 --> 00:25:32.648
So that's the first step.

590
00:25:32.648 --> 00:25:33.916
<v Woman>You have to know it's possible.</v>

591
00:25:33.916 --> 00:25:35.752
<v ->You have to know that it's possible.</v>

592
00:25:35.752 --> 00:25:36.786
<v Woman>You have to believe it.</v>

593
00:25:36.786 --> 00:25:37.955
<v ->You have to believe it.</v>

594
00:25:37.955 --> 00:25:40.423
And sometimes you gotta fake it til you make it.

595
00:25:40.423 --> 00:25:41.991
<v Woman>That's a big one.</v>

596
00:25:41.991 --> 00:25:43.060
<v ->It's a big one.</v>

597
00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.629
<v Woman>And it's so important</v>

598
00:25:45.629 --> 00:25:48.164
I think what a lot of people don't understand

599
00:25:48.164 --> 00:25:51.235
is that in the faking it, you're starting

600
00:25:51.235 --> 00:25:54.438
to create these new neural networks, these new patterns.

601
00:25:54.438 --> 00:25:56.973
<v ->Oh absolutely, that's exactly what's going on.</v>

602
00:25:56.973 --> 00:25:58.775
That's exactly what's going on.

603
00:25:58.775 --> 00:26:01.344
Because now you're triggering something inside of yourself.

604
00:26:01.344 --> 00:26:05.049
You're awakening your own,

605
00:26:05.049 --> 00:26:08.618
what we say in Buddhism, your own bodhicitta

606
00:26:08.618 --> 00:26:13.618
which is this altruistic compassion way of being,

607
00:26:13.856 --> 00:26:15.759
way of seeing things and way of living.

608
00:26:15.759 --> 00:26:18.161
You're triggering your own bodhicitta

609
00:26:18.161 --> 00:26:23.157
and so then it just--

610
00:26:23.157 --> 00:26:25.402
<v Woman>The brain starts habituating to it</v>

611
00:26:25.402 --> 00:26:28.805
and then the greater mind and the whole being is habituating

612
00:26:28.805 --> 00:26:31.041
<v ->And then when you get back</v>

613
00:26:31.041 --> 00:26:33.976
what you're giving out, and it will come back.

614
00:26:33.976 --> 00:26:36.413
The love that you give, it comes back.

615
00:26:36.413 --> 00:26:40.384
In the prisons I feel more loved

616
00:26:40.384 --> 00:26:42.953
than perhaps I would feel out there.

617
00:26:42.953 --> 00:26:44.488
I feel more safe and more secure

618
00:26:44.488 --> 00:26:47.424
in the prison than I do out there.

619
00:26:47.424 --> 00:26:48.925
<v Woman>You made a comment that there's,</v>

620
00:26:48.925 --> 00:26:50.343
someone was saying, there are

621
00:26:50.343 --> 00:26:51.862
so many wonderful people in this world,

622
00:26:51.862 --> 00:26:54.030
and you said "And a lot of them are in prison."

623
00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:55.499
<v ->A lot of them are in prison.</v>

624
00:26:55.499 --> 00:26:59.903
Wonderful human beings with gifts and talents.

625
00:26:59.903 --> 00:27:01.372
Wonderful human beings.

626
00:27:01.372 --> 00:27:04.074
They just haven't been able to, had the opportunity

627
00:27:04.074 --> 00:27:05.976
or haven't been able to see the opportunity,

628
00:27:05.976 --> 00:27:10.046
haven't been able to express this wonderfulness.

629
00:27:10.046 --> 00:27:11.448
<v Woman>They haven't been given a lot of opportunities.</v>

630
00:27:11.448 --> 00:27:13.483
<v ->They haven't been given a lot of opportunities.</v>

631
00:27:13.483 --> 00:27:15.485
And so now, for the first time,

632
00:27:15.485 --> 00:27:17.687
they surprise themselves.

633
00:27:17.687 --> 00:27:19.355
I'm a high school dropout and

634
00:27:19.355 --> 00:27:22.692
if you had seen my report card

635
00:27:22.692 --> 00:27:26.295
when I was in junior high and in high school,

636
00:27:26.295 --> 00:27:27.698
straight Fs.

637
00:27:27.698 --> 00:27:30.034
I probably got maybe an A in gym,

638
00:27:30.034 --> 00:27:31.401
and that was the only A I got.

639
00:27:31.401 --> 00:27:32.636
Straight Fs.

640
00:27:32.636 --> 00:27:36.472
And I really had this idea that I was

641
00:27:36.472 --> 00:27:38.842
unintelligent and that I couldn't learn.

642
00:27:38.842 --> 00:27:40.210
Although something inside of me said

643
00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.945
that I wasn't, but I had this belief.

644
00:27:42.945 --> 00:27:46.429
And certainly the results bore that out.

645
00:27:46.429 --> 00:27:47.217
<v Woman>Were validating that.</v>

646
00:27:47.217 --> 00:27:48.885
<v ->Were validating that, absolutely, yeah.</v>

647
00:27:48.885 --> 00:27:51.955
So I remember when I entered college

648
00:27:51.955 --> 00:27:55.492
and I got my first A I surprised myself.

649
00:27:55.492 --> 00:27:57.827
It blew my mind, it shocked me

650
00:27:57.827 --> 00:28:00.230
because I didn't think I was capable of an A.

651
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:01.632
But once I got that first A

652
00:28:01.632 --> 00:28:03.433
then I knew it was possible and then

653
00:28:03.433 --> 00:28:06.370
I wanted more As.

654
00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:09.005
I kept pursuing it and pursuing it and continued.

655
00:28:09.005 --> 00:28:10.774
I didn't always make As.

656
00:28:10.774 --> 00:28:13.677
Sometimes I made a B, one time I made a C.

657
00:28:13.677 --> 00:28:16.780
<v Woman>Devastating, after a lifetime of Fs.</v>

658
00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:19.741
<v ->That's right, but the goal</v>

659
00:28:19.741 --> 00:28:22.701
was to achieve the A.

660
00:28:22.701 --> 00:28:24.654
So the same thing, once we find out

661
00:28:24.654 --> 00:28:28.058
that we have this potential for goodness

662
00:28:28.058 --> 00:28:32.429
and once we actually test it out

663
00:28:32.429 --> 00:28:35.798
and then we find that, ok I trust it.

664
00:28:35.798 --> 00:28:38.902
And I didn't get shut down.

665
00:28:38.902 --> 00:28:41.271
And I was actually able to love and I was loved back.

666
00:28:41.271 --> 00:28:43.473
Then we want more of that.

667
00:28:43.473 --> 00:28:46.644
And the more it happens, the more we want.

668
00:28:46.644 --> 00:28:48.845
This is what propels us forward.

669
00:28:48.845 --> 00:28:52.549
That becomes the thing that we're chasing after.

670
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:55.790
Not so much that we get the love,

671
00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:58.487
but it's giving the love because then we realize

672
00:28:58.487 --> 00:29:00.457
that that's how I get the love.

673
00:29:00.457 --> 00:29:01.524
<v Woman>Yeah that's the active part,</v>

674
00:29:01.524 --> 00:29:03.093
that's where your energy is actually into it,

675
00:29:03.093 --> 00:29:05.344
is in the giving.

676
00:29:05.344 --> 00:29:06.396
<v ->And then</v>

677
00:29:06.396 --> 00:29:08.998
you can't be stopped.

678
00:29:08.998 --> 00:29:11.333
It's just not stoppable.

679
00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:15.738
And then soon, you're out of the picture.

680
00:29:15.738 --> 00:29:18.742
I'm giving because I just want to give.

681
00:29:18.742 --> 00:29:23.413
We all want happiness, we all want to be free of suffering.

682
00:29:23.413 --> 00:29:24.881
It's how we define these things.

683
00:29:24.881 --> 00:29:27.584
What is our definition of happiness?

684
00:29:27.584 --> 00:29:29.687
That's the thing, if we can get on the

685
00:29:29.687 --> 00:29:31.888
same page with what happiness is,

686
00:29:31.888 --> 00:29:35.825
then we can all achieve the result.

687
00:29:35.825 --> 00:29:37.060
<v Woman>Let me ask you a question.</v>

688
00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.495
This conference, we've heard many, many speakers

689
00:29:39.495 --> 00:29:41.964
all talking about happiness from a different angle.

690
00:29:41.964 --> 00:29:44.233
What have you heard as the dominant,

691
00:29:44.233 --> 00:29:47.337
say the top two or three dominant themes

692
00:29:47.337 --> 00:29:49.138
that everyone's in agreement on here?

693
00:29:49.138 --> 00:29:52.908
<v ->I think serving others,</v>

694
00:29:52.908 --> 00:29:54.312
living our life for the sake of others.

695
00:29:54.312 --> 00:29:58.044
As the Dalai Lama says, if you want happiness, serve others.

696
00:29:58.044 --> 00:30:03.044
And so I think that's the dominant one.

697
00:30:03.319 --> 00:30:05.255
<v Woman>That seems like it is, yes.</v>

698
00:30:05.255 --> 00:30:06.790
And connectedness with others.

699
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.592
Connectedness is the deepest thing--

700
00:30:08.592 --> 00:30:09.559
<v ->If we suffer, right,</v>

701
00:30:09.559 --> 00:30:13.229
we suffer when we're by ourselves.

702
00:30:13.229 --> 00:30:14.931
<v Woman>We're seeking that.</v>

703
00:30:14.931 --> 00:30:17.400
<v ->We're seeking that and as long as we stay isolated,</v>

704
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.436
as long as we stay by ourselves we will always be.

705
00:30:20.436 --> 00:30:21.437
Because why?

706
00:30:21.437 --> 00:30:25.374
All we have is just our own suffering, our own mind

707
00:30:25.374 --> 00:30:27.377
and we can't find a way out of it.

708
00:30:27.377 --> 00:30:30.914
But the moment we connect to another human being

709
00:30:30.914 --> 00:30:32.483
to another life, could be our dog

710
00:30:32.483 --> 00:30:33.583
could be our cat,

711
00:30:33.583 --> 00:30:36.919
the moment we connect to another sentient being,

712
00:30:36.919 --> 00:30:41.776
another life, then we move away from ourself.

713
00:30:41.776 --> 00:30:46.653
And then we're able to feel human again,

714
00:30:46.653 --> 00:30:51.373
to feel whole, to feel of value.

715
00:30:53.343 --> 00:30:56.934
So again, if you want

716
00:30:59.414 --> 00:31:02.311
to be a loving, kind, compassionate person

717
00:31:02.311 --> 00:31:07.149
then generate loving, kind, compassionate thoughts.

718
00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:09.485
It's really that simple, in theory.

719
00:31:09.485 --> 00:31:12.087
It takes work, it takes time.

720
00:31:12.087 --> 00:31:14.324
<v Woman>A little bit of practice.</v>

721
00:31:14.324 --> 00:31:15.358
<v ->A little bit of practice, yeah.</v>

722
00:31:15.358 --> 00:31:17.928
<v Woman>Andre, thank you so much for your time.</v>

723
00:31:17.928 --> 00:31:20.867
<v ->You're welcome, my pleasure, my pleasure.</v>

724
00:31:20.867 --> 00:31:22.952
(gentle music)

725
00:31:22.952 --> 00:31:24.868
<v ->Andre touched our hearts very deeply</v>

726
00:31:24.868 --> 00:31:26.836
and one can only hope that each one of us

727
00:31:26.836 --> 00:31:28.605
can find the grace to forgive

728
00:31:28.605 --> 00:31:30.306
no matter what life has in store.

729
00:31:30.306 --> 00:31:33.243
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

730
00:31:33.243 --> 00:31:38.239
(gentle piano music)
