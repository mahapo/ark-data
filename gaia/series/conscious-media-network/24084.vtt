00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:03.009
<v ->This man's work may be one of the greatest</v>

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.199
contributions to healing mankind, we've come across to date.

3
00:00:06.388 --> 00:00:09.169
Lee Gerdes refers to himself as a Theologian,

4
00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:11.898
cognitive therapist, and above all else, a geek.

5
00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:14.019
And he has the credentials to prove it.

6
00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.008
Lee was the person who designed marketing algorithm

7
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:19.898
based systems for Fortune 500 retailers.

8
00:00:19.988 --> 00:00:21.508
Some of which offer services,

9
00:00:21.508 --> 00:00:23.308
such as the online retail model of

10
00:00:23.308 --> 00:00:26.658
other people who bought this book also like these.

11
00:00:26.788 --> 00:00:29.608
Now he's combined everything he's learned in his lifetime

12
00:00:29.608 --> 00:00:31.749
to create a technology that borrows

13
00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:34.188
from the healing power of neuro-feedback,

14
00:00:34.188 --> 00:00:36.568
and overlays it with computer software,

15
00:00:36.568 --> 00:00:38.708
that in effect, evolves our brains through

16
00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:40.678
creating more neural connections.

17
00:00:40.848 --> 00:00:42.778
The results are astounding.

18
00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.358 line:15% 
So you have a background in high tech.

19
00:00:49.488 --> 00:00:52.108 line:15% 
And you've also been involved with endeavors that are,

20
00:00:52.108 --> 00:00:53.978
I think you could call altruistic.

21
00:00:54.248 --> 00:00:55.628
Your work in San Francisco.

22
00:00:55.628 --> 00:00:56.207
<v ->Right.</v>

23
00:00:56.207 --> 00:00:59.066
<v ->And how did this, how did the two come together</v>

24
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:02.647
to do what, I think in some cases, people would say,

25
00:01:03.325 --> 00:01:06.334
really create something that's having miraculous effects?

26
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.810
<v ->Well I'm in the high tech field in Minnesota.</v>

27
00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:13.661
And so one of the things you want in Minnesota,

28
00:01:13.661 --> 00:01:16.550
in the winter, is to get out of Minnesota.

29
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.689
So that wasn't necessarily the reason.

30
00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.650
I did change, but that was, it was certainly part of it.

31
00:01:26.058 --> 00:01:27.618
In Minnesota, the company I was in,

32
00:01:27.618 --> 00:01:28.997
is called Net Perception.

33
00:01:28.997 --> 00:01:30.826
So I was vice president of solutions.

34
00:01:31.097 --> 00:01:35.376
And I needed a way to train my own brain

35
00:01:35.376 --> 00:01:38.387
to go from creative to tactical.

36
00:01:38.896 --> 00:01:40.856
To do RND on the one hand,

37
00:01:40.856 --> 00:01:43.506
and to do tactical application on the other hand,

38
00:01:43.996 --> 00:01:46.357
with consulting, with agreements,

39
00:01:46.357 --> 00:01:49.827
with all of that kind of business work, tactically.

40
00:01:50.177 --> 00:01:53.027
<v ->Which everybody pretty much needs this balance, right?</v>

41
00:01:53.197 --> 00:01:54.976
And were you lopsided toward

42
00:01:54.976 --> 00:01:56.606
one versus the other at this time?

43
00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:58.416
<v ->Everybody needs the balance,</v>

44
00:01:58.416 --> 00:02:01.187
but not everybody is a male.

45
00:02:02.556 --> 00:02:03.216
<v ->Aha.</v>

46
00:02:03.216 --> 00:02:06.937
<v ->If I'm a female, I can go from creative to tactical,</v>

47
00:02:06.937 --> 00:02:10.727
and back to forth, much faster than I can if I'm a male.

48
00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:14.956
And by the way, that says a lot for like

49
00:02:14.956 --> 00:02:16.936
political leaders in our country too.

50
00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:19.157
<v ->Yes, I want to get to that in a little bit here.</v>

51
00:02:20.175 --> 00:02:22.765
<v ->So I needed a way to flip the switch.</v>

52
00:02:23.455 --> 00:02:27.094
And so I found a way to do that, by taking

53
00:02:27.094 --> 00:02:30.374
a basic science that was 30 years old,

54
00:02:30.374 --> 00:02:34.294
called neuro-feedback, and investigating that

55
00:02:34.294 --> 00:02:36.214
with a company in Australia, then another

56
00:02:36.214 --> 00:02:38.234
company in the Netherlands, and then

57
00:02:38.234 --> 00:02:42.254
coming up with some software to train my brain

58
00:02:42.254 --> 00:02:45.954
to click on and click off on one side versus

59
00:02:45.954 --> 00:02:47.684
the other side in a certain way.

60
00:02:48.274 --> 00:02:49.314
And it worked for me.

61
00:02:49.314 --> 00:02:53.114
And I was more than successful, I was very

62
00:02:53.114 --> 00:02:55.524
successful at it, and enjoyed it.

63
00:02:55.954 --> 00:03:00.074
At the same time, my son wasn't

64
00:03:00.074 --> 00:03:01.673
doing it as well as he might.

65
00:03:01.673 --> 00:03:03.582
(laughing)

66
00:03:04.042 --> 00:03:05.422
<v ->Care to elaborate?</v>

67
00:03:05.432 --> 00:03:10.432
<v ->He was at Iowa State, and he basically had flunked out.</v>

68
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.950
And so I made him a deal, actually I bribed him.

69
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:16.770
Okay, I'm a dad.

70
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.210
<v ->Okay, that's what we do as parents.</v>

71
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.691
<v ->And I'm a heavy geek, and so I wanted</v>

72
00:03:20.691 --> 00:03:24.070
him to be a scholar too, and so I made my deal,

73
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.031
that if you let me him, I would pay

74
00:03:27.031 --> 00:03:28.630
for his going back to school,

75
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.580
and he would rock and roll from there.

76
00:03:30.931 --> 00:03:33.790
So he let me train him, train his brain.

77
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.790
And with the software and the technology I developed,

78
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.510
and when I did, and he went back to school,

79
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.650
he went on the deans list just-

80
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.228
<v ->From flunking out to the deans list.</v>

81
00:03:43.228 --> 00:03:45.148
That's quite a spike in his GPA.

82
00:03:45.148 --> 00:03:46.338
<v ->It was indeed.</v>

83
00:03:46.588 --> 00:03:48.026
1.8 to 3.85.

84
00:03:48.026 --> 00:03:49.206
<v ->Very good.</v>

85
00:03:49.206 --> 00:03:54.206
<v ->So next question is then, so, is this the bribe</v>

86
00:03:56.766 --> 00:03:58.296
or is this the technology, question.

87
00:03:59.345 --> 00:04:01.565
So we chose about eight other students,

88
00:04:01.565 --> 00:04:04.815
all of whom were flunking out or had already funked out,

89
00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:07.515
we trained them, they all went to the deans list.

90
00:04:07.745 --> 00:04:09.555
Every one went to the deans list.

91
00:04:10.025 --> 00:04:13.224
So now I say, we got something here.

92
00:04:13.224 --> 00:04:15.944
<v ->This has some really interesting implications.</v>

93
00:04:15.944 --> 00:04:20.794
Because so often, kids are labeled as non-achievers,

94
00:04:20.904 --> 00:04:23.044
when in fact, it's something entirely different

95
00:04:23.044 --> 00:04:24.314
in a lot of cases.

96
00:04:25.124 --> 00:04:26.944
<v ->I would say almost all cases.</v>

97
00:04:26.944 --> 00:04:27.844
<v ->Really?</v>

98
00:04:27.844 --> 00:04:29.934
<v ->Almost all cases.
<v ->Almost all cases.</v>

99
00:04:31.783 --> 00:04:34.163
<v ->I can't really think of the exception to that right now.</v>

100
00:04:34.163 --> 00:04:37.293
Certainly if I had more time to think about it,

101
00:04:37.503 --> 00:04:39.793
I'm a male, and so it takes me longer to think.

102
00:04:40.563 --> 00:04:42.463
But if i had more time to think about it,

103
00:04:42.463 --> 00:04:44.263
certainly I could come up with something.

104
00:04:44.263 --> 00:04:46.713
But almost all cases, that's true.

105
00:04:46.923 --> 00:04:48.343
<v ->Can we talk about that,</v>

106
00:04:48.343 --> 00:04:51.643
just that which is phenomenal in and of itself,

107
00:04:51.643 --> 00:04:54.522
which is having a lack of motivation,

108
00:04:54.522 --> 00:04:56.642
versus being lit up and ready to go,

109
00:04:56.642 --> 00:04:58.652
and make things happen in the world.

110
00:04:58.942 --> 00:05:00.782
What is going on in the human brain,

111
00:05:00.782 --> 00:05:03.282
in someone who is lethargic, and just can't

112
00:05:03.282 --> 00:05:05.842
get focused and get going often times?

113
00:05:05.842 --> 00:05:06.962
What have you discovered?

114
00:05:06.962 --> 00:05:11.272
<v ->Well, this is actually right back to where we were.</v>

115
00:05:11.622 --> 00:05:13.962
After I trained him and we did the discovery

116
00:05:13.962 --> 00:05:15.692
that other students were responding.

117
00:05:16.002 --> 00:05:18.752
Then the question became, well what's this about?

118
00:05:19.862 --> 00:05:21.672
Why is it, why now?

119
00:05:22.602 --> 00:05:25.392
And why does this technology efficacious, it seems like.

120
00:05:25.482 --> 00:05:27.352
So what's the story?

121
00:05:27.642 --> 00:05:32.242
Well research'll you that in the last 50 years,

122
00:05:32.242 --> 00:05:34.642
the input to the human brain has

123
00:05:34.642 --> 00:05:39.192
increased 10,000 times per second.

124
00:05:39.942 --> 00:05:42.832
Now, the brain beats 10,000 timer per second.

125
00:05:43.002 --> 00:05:45.792
so that's a ten percent hit to the brain.

126
00:05:46.802 --> 00:05:48.722
In other words, society culture has

127
00:05:48.722 --> 00:05:50.812
evolved much faster than the brain.

128
00:05:51.442 --> 00:05:54.242
Okay, so in another 100 or 200 years,

129
00:05:54.242 --> 00:05:56.262
this technology won't be used.

130
00:05:56.262 --> 00:05:58.441
but you know, that gives us 100 or 200 years to what?

131
00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:01.671
<v ->Good yeas, good 200 good years running.</v>

132
00:06:03.701 --> 00:06:08.211
<v ->So I believe that's the real cause for most of us.</v>

133
00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:11.981
that's it's easy to get out of balance because of that.

134
00:06:11.981 --> 00:06:15.061
And I think that can be seen because almost 30%

135
00:06:15.061 --> 00:06:18.041
of our grade school population in the Unites States

136
00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:23.041
is now diagnosed with ADD.

137
00:06:23.041 --> 00:06:24.361
<v ->Right, that was going to be my</v>

138
00:06:24.361 --> 00:06:25.561
next question as a matter of fact.

139
00:06:25.561 --> 00:06:28.561
So from the cradle to the grave,

140
00:06:28.561 --> 00:06:32.741
we have way too much input by way of media,

141
00:06:32.741 --> 00:06:35.201
by way of life experience moving through life,

142
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.790
on every level would you say?

143
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.060
We're just being saturated with information,

144
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.430
images, sounds.

145
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.110
In essence, brain pollution.

146
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.520
<v ->Well, most people will tell you I believe,</v>

147
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.640
when they feel stressed in their life.

148
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.550
They say, no more.

149
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.830
Just stop, you know.

150
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.230
Just stop.

151
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.790
And that's valuable information.

152
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.740
But it really isn't pertinent in all

153
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.139
the scheme of things, in terms of,

154
00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:07.539
I mean, the truth is,

155
00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:09.769
we have three trillion neurons.

156
00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:12.189
We use about 3%.

157
00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:15.717
We could literally be 30 times smarter, 30 times.

158
00:07:15.717 --> 00:07:17.197
<v ->So how come we're being overwhelmed if</v>

159
00:07:17.197 --> 00:07:18.957
we're using such a small part of our brain?

160
00:07:18.957 --> 00:07:20.797
What is the overwhelm factor that is

161
00:07:20.797 --> 00:07:24.277
creating ADD, ADHD in problems

162
00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.307
like your son and his friends were experiencing?

163
00:07:26.377 --> 00:07:28.187
<v ->The brain hasn't evolved yet there.</v>

164
00:07:28.497 --> 00:07:31.377
So what we do is we encourage the building

165
00:07:31.377 --> 00:07:33.447
of that brain evolvement.

166
00:07:34.077 --> 00:07:36.337
And we do that by simply encouragement.

167
00:07:36.337 --> 00:07:38.977
And we do it, and then the brain happens to evolve

168
00:07:38.977 --> 00:07:40.947
and it builds its own neuro-nets.

169
00:07:41.437 --> 00:07:43.367
Now neuro-nets are kind of interesting.

170
00:07:43.697 --> 00:07:47.097
If you build your bicept by lifting weights,

171
00:07:47.097 --> 00:07:50.477
your bicept will get big, but then you stop lifting weights

172
00:07:50.477 --> 00:07:52.127
and after a time, what happens?

173
00:07:52.177 --> 00:07:53.197
<v ->It weakens again.</v>

174
00:07:53.197 --> 00:07:54.917
<v ->Exactly, it atrophies even.</v>

175
00:07:55.656 --> 00:07:57.516
Now if you build a neuro-net,

176
00:07:57.516 --> 00:07:58.596
you ride a bicycle?

177
00:07:58.596 --> 00:07:59.216
<v ->Mm hmm.</v>

178
00:07:59.216 --> 00:08:01.176
<v ->Have you ridden a bicycle when you were a kid?</v>

179
00:08:01.176 --> 00:08:01.736
<v ->Mm Hmm.</v>

180
00:08:01.736 --> 00:08:03.136
<v ->Do you now?</v>

181
00:08:03.136 --> 00:08:03.915
<v ->Some times, yeah.</v>

182
00:08:03.915 --> 00:08:07.215
There's no difference, the memory's still there.

183
00:08:07.215 --> 00:08:08.325
<v ->The memory is still there.</v>

184
00:08:08.395 --> 00:08:11.035
Okay, that's basically proof that

185
00:08:11.035 --> 00:08:12.395
the neuro-net is still there.

186
00:08:12.395 --> 00:08:14.825
Once you develop this neuro net, it stays with you.

187
00:08:15.735 --> 00:08:18.245
The other side of the coin though, is this.

188
00:08:19.375 --> 00:08:22.845
Most of our brain functions, and most of our life,

189
00:08:23.215 --> 00:08:25.705
what we see, what we think, what we say,

190
00:08:25.775 --> 00:08:27.915
what we experience and what we feel,

191
00:08:27.915 --> 00:08:30.905
most of our life is done by automatic function.

192
00:08:31.114 --> 00:08:32.834
<v ->Mm hmm, subconscious,</v>

193
00:08:32.834 --> 00:08:35.494
basically motivation of our programming.

194
00:08:35.494 --> 00:08:35.973
<v ->Stimuli.</v>

195
00:08:35.973 --> 00:08:36.553
<v ->Right.</v>

196
00:08:36.553 --> 00:08:37.053
<v ->Response.</v>

197
00:08:37.053 --> 00:08:38.103
<v ->Right.</v>

198
00:08:38.173 --> 00:08:41.573
<v ->So if I now asked you to raise your arm</v>

199
00:08:41.573 --> 00:08:43.993
and you acquest to that, your arm would go up,

200
00:08:44.412 --> 00:08:46.562
because your brain sends signals right.

201
00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:48.531
Your nervous system, through the nervous system.

202
00:08:48.531 --> 00:08:50.081
Muscles contract, arm goes up.

203
00:08:50.391 --> 00:08:51.931
If I now asked you, I say, okay,

204
00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:54.300
I've got a million dollars here.

205
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.460
You have to perspire heavily for me in two seconds.

206
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.700
You couldn't do that, but you would try.

207
00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:01.810
<v ->You'd try, you'd be sweating alright,</v>

208
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.745
but it might not show in two minutes.

209
00:09:03.745 --> 00:09:04.765
(laughing)

210
00:09:04.765 --> 00:09:08.005
<v ->But, because the perspiration is an automatic function.</v>

211
00:09:08.005 --> 00:09:08.742
<v ->Right.</v>

212
00:09:08.742 --> 00:09:11.621
<v ->And so what you see there is totally different.</v>

213
00:09:11.621 --> 00:09:12.121
<v ->Sure.</v>

214
00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:13.371
<v ->Is totally different.</v>

215
00:09:13.421 --> 00:09:15.461
When you train a brain, when you develop it,

216
00:09:15.461 --> 00:09:18.761
and when we do brain state conditioning with a brain,

217
00:09:18.761 --> 00:09:21.811
what happens is that automatic functioning changes.

218
00:09:22.141 --> 00:09:23.621
And it increases.

219
00:09:23.621 --> 00:09:28.081
It gives the person more options, more neuro-nets to follow,

220
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:29.511
more responses to do.

221
00:09:29.921 --> 00:09:31.891
And it's very, very empowering.

222
00:09:32.941 --> 00:09:36.361
<v ->So you're, from my understanding,</v>

223
00:09:36.361 --> 00:09:39.001
when you had to look at the models you were basing this on

224
00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:41.360
in terms of what a healthy and expanded,

225
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.620
and perhaps even more revolve brain looks like,

226
00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:48.070
you turned to the world of Tibetian Buddhism.

227
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.560
Didn't you use monks, that's my understanding?

228
00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.360
<v ->Right.</v>

229
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.140
<v ->And what happened?</v>

230
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:57.140
<v ->The question was, what could be the problem?</v>

231
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.630
And the problem seemed relatively straight forward.

232
00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:06.540
A fast evolving culture, and human evolution

233
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:07.779
not keeping up.

234
00:10:07.779 --> 00:10:08.379
<v ->Right.</v>

235
00:10:08.379 --> 00:10:10.769
<v ->I understood that, science understands that.</v>

236
00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:15.139
Second question is, so how do we determine

237
00:10:15.139 --> 00:10:18.279
how your brain and my brain, which are different

238
00:10:18.279 --> 00:10:23.279
as finger prints, how those two brains will get conditioned,

239
00:10:24.139 --> 00:10:25.909
such that they could be optimized.

240
00:10:26.239 --> 00:10:27.929
That's the question on the table.

241
00:10:28.359 --> 00:10:33.359
So I had basically two general philosophies

242
00:10:33.419 --> 00:10:35.069
of understanding to approach.

243
00:10:35.499 --> 00:10:37.299
One philosophy and understanding,

244
00:10:37.299 --> 00:10:40.929
is that which we consider to be a medical model.

245
00:10:41.879 --> 00:10:44.279
In other words, you diagnose the problem,

246
00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:45.739
you see it's right there.

247
00:10:46.158 --> 00:10:48.058
And you look at this person and compare

248
00:10:48.058 --> 00:10:52.618
this person to this event, or this brain function,

249
00:10:52.618 --> 00:10:55.218
to many other brain functions right there

250
00:10:55.218 --> 00:10:57.408
in that particular lobe let's say.

251
00:10:57.998 --> 00:10:59.397
And you see if it's off.

252
00:10:59.397 --> 00:11:01.037
If there's a big delta between them,

253
00:11:01.037 --> 00:11:04.087
okay you try to change this one, because you say it's wrong.

254
00:11:04.577 --> 00:11:05.987
So that's the medical model.

255
00:11:06.117 --> 00:11:07.127
Diagnose it.

256
00:11:08.037 --> 00:11:09.939
The other side is more of a holistic

257
00:11:09.939 --> 00:11:11.869
kind of understanding model.

258
00:11:12.019 --> 00:11:14.819
And that literally, I mean I gotta tell you the truth.

259
00:11:14.819 --> 00:11:16.969
I didn't know beans about it.

260
00:11:17.119 --> 00:11:18.319
You know, I didn't know.

261
00:11:18.319 --> 00:11:20.019
(laughs)

262
00:11:20.358 --> 00:11:21.948
But I did know how it felt.

263
00:11:22.038 --> 00:11:22.558
<v ->Right.</v>

264
00:11:22.558 --> 00:11:25.718
<v ->And I knew that it didn't feel good</v>

265
00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:29.388
to try to diagnose somebody else's brain function.

266
00:11:29.678 --> 00:11:33.018
Because I didn't understand, i can't understand what

267
00:11:33.018 --> 00:11:36.638
your experience even is, let alone diagnose your brain.

268
00:11:36.638 --> 00:11:37.498
<v ->Right.</v>

269
00:11:37.498 --> 00:11:39.848
<v ->What I can do though, is tell you,</v>

270
00:11:40.438 --> 00:11:44.658
you know, if you're blissful, and he's blissful

271
00:11:44.658 --> 00:11:46.198
and whatever, and he's blissful,

272
00:11:46.198 --> 00:11:49.308
there's a certain degree of commonality there.

273
00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:50.818
You can see it, you can feel it,

274
00:11:50.818 --> 00:11:51.998
you can experience it,

275
00:11:51.998 --> 00:11:54.878
and you literally love to be around it.

276
00:11:54.878 --> 00:11:55.318
<v ->Right.</v>

277
00:11:55.318 --> 00:11:55.857
<v ->Right?</v>

278
00:11:56.115 --> 00:11:58.775
So I said, well, what the heck am I,

279
00:11:59.274 --> 00:12:01.774
I'm not so blissful some times you know.

280
00:12:01.774 --> 00:12:03.754
I just came out of the business world for crying out loud.

281
00:12:03.754 --> 00:12:04.294
<v ->There you go.</v>

282
00:12:04.294 --> 00:12:05.214
<v ->I'm not blissful at all.</v>

283
00:12:05.214 --> 00:12:07.494
So where am I gonna find that?

284
00:12:07.494 --> 00:12:10.864
And I thought, ah, you know.

285
00:12:11.294 --> 00:12:16.294
I'll go to Tibetian monks, and work with them and see

286
00:12:17.233 --> 00:12:21.083
how their state of bliss, and see if I can brain map them.

287
00:12:21.493 --> 00:12:24.313
When I did that, I brain mapped them

288
00:12:24.313 --> 00:12:26.313
when they were in conversation like we are.

289
00:12:26.313 --> 00:12:27.873
i brain mapped them at various stages

290
00:12:27.873 --> 00:12:29.773
of different kinds of meditation.

291
00:12:29.773 --> 00:12:31.893
And I saw that the power they had,

292
00:12:31.893 --> 00:12:33.883
the brain power was huge.

293
00:12:34.433 --> 00:12:36.373
Both, I've worked with two,

294
00:12:36.373 --> 00:12:41.183
both of them had been meditating for over 40 years.

295
00:12:41.193 --> 00:12:44.853
Both were high master level kind of folk.

296
00:12:44.853 --> 00:12:46.453
<v ->And essentially, had been there since childhood</v>

297
00:12:46.453 --> 00:12:47.473
is usually, is the case.

298
00:12:47.473 --> 00:12:47.991
<v ->Three or four, yeah.</v>

299
00:12:47.991 --> 00:12:49.231
<v ->Right, uh huh.</v>

300
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:52.670
<v ->And both were not only blissful,</v>

301
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:55.480
but very intuitive and very perceptive too.

302
00:12:57.249 --> 00:13:01.479
And so, when I was finished with that work with them,

303
00:13:01.529 --> 00:13:04.229
pondering over, and remember I'm a geek, right?

304
00:13:04.229 --> 00:13:06.249
So I'm pondering over the numbers right?

305
00:13:06.249 --> 00:13:09.179
I get down to the, I want, show me the numbers.

306
00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:12.089
And I got down to the numbers, and when I did,

307
00:13:12.089 --> 00:13:15.419
what I found out was that they both had certain,

308
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:18.289
for a lack of a better term, ratios.

309
00:13:18.289 --> 00:13:19.949
It's much more complicated that ratios.

310
00:13:19.949 --> 00:13:21.319
But let's say ratios,

311
00:13:22.169 --> 00:13:24.129
between this part of the brain, and that part of the brain

312
00:13:24.129 --> 00:13:25.699
when they're in this kind of state.

313
00:13:26.669 --> 00:13:30.219
I thought, oh, well let me look at other folk,

314
00:13:30.449 --> 00:13:32.668
you know, who are in the, who I've trained

315
00:13:32.668 --> 00:13:34.678
like some of the students we trained, etcetera.

316
00:13:34.828 --> 00:13:36.288
Let me look at their brain patterns,

317
00:13:36.288 --> 00:13:37.478
and see what they were.

318
00:13:37.968 --> 00:13:40.667
And then I say, oh they weren't nearly as close to

319
00:13:40.667 --> 00:13:43.757
that ratio when they started, as when they ended.

320
00:13:43.847 --> 00:13:44.707
<v ->Aha.</v>

321
00:13:44.707 --> 00:13:48.437
<v ->And so I said, aha, I'll make this an algorithm, right?</v>

322
00:13:48.867 --> 00:13:51.187
And then I'll start looking at other algorithms,

323
00:13:51.187 --> 00:13:56.187
and now we build probably well over 1,000 of those.

324
00:13:57.487 --> 00:14:00.267
And so we look at various frequencies of the brain,

325
00:14:00.267 --> 00:14:04.017
various ways that those frequencies interact all over.

326
00:14:04.287 --> 00:14:06.427
And so, and that's what we use

327
00:14:06.427 --> 00:14:08.405
as a balance in harmonizing plan.

328
00:14:08.405 --> 00:14:09.885
<v ->So you're really shooting for</v>

329
00:14:09.885 --> 00:14:12.035
the mean at the highest level.

330
00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:14.775
Not going for a societial average.

331
00:14:15.565 --> 00:14:17.505
Which wouldn't really be helping a lot of people, right?

332
00:14:17.505 --> 00:14:19.355
<v ->For that particular person too.</v>

333
00:14:19.355 --> 00:14:20.771
<v ->Right.
<v ->Because, note that</v>

334
00:14:21.781 --> 00:14:23.041
if you go around the office

335
00:14:23.041 --> 00:14:25.001
you'll see some paintings, and those paintings

336
00:14:25.001 --> 00:14:26.791
have all been done by artists we've trained.

337
00:14:28.001 --> 00:14:29.861
And we've trained them for creativity,

338
00:14:29.861 --> 00:14:33.271
and then that's produced some outstanding results.

339
00:14:33.281 --> 00:14:36.011
We've trained composers, we've trained athletes,

340
00:14:36.141 --> 00:14:39.611
we've trained businessmen, and we've trained drug addicts.

341
00:14:39.661 --> 00:14:42.171
And we've trained people on probation.

342
00:14:42.721 --> 00:14:45.641
And we've trained people with depression,

343
00:14:45.641 --> 00:14:48.091
and various other kinds of problems.

344
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.560
<v ->So, though you were originally developing this</v>

345
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:55.720
to enhance brain performance, from whatever your mean was,

346
00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.730
and then your sons, and his friends and others,

347
00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.239
you have now gone into situations which are

348
00:15:01.239 --> 00:15:04.269
much more pathological even, in some cases.

349
00:15:04.579 --> 00:15:07.559
And you're using it on a whole different level than you had

350
00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:09.449
originally started with, aren't you?

351
00:15:09.499 --> 00:15:10.609
<v ->Yes and no.</v>

352
00:15:11.499 --> 00:15:13.959
Yes, because we have an open door policy,

353
00:15:13.959 --> 00:15:15.629
and we've taken everybody.

354
00:15:16.238 --> 00:15:20.038
We've taken people who have every major

355
00:15:20.038 --> 00:15:22.138
kind of problem you can imagine, and many

356
00:15:22.138 --> 00:15:23.668
that you have never heard of.

357
00:15:24.918 --> 00:15:29.278
But no, because we don't diagnose them, and we don't

358
00:15:29.278 --> 00:15:30.456
accept their diagnosis.
<v ->There you go.</v>

359
00:15:30.456 --> 00:15:31.496
Yeah, that makes sense.

360
00:15:31.496 --> 00:15:33.876
<v ->And we do balance and harmony,</v>

361
00:15:34.375 --> 00:15:35.795
you know, we're pretty simple folk.

362
00:15:35.795 --> 00:15:37.445
You know, we're balance and harmony guys.

363
00:15:38.495 --> 00:15:39.935
<v ->I want to find out-
<v ->And gals, by the way.</v>

364
00:15:39.935 --> 00:15:42.135
<v ->Of course, and let's speak about guys and gals</v>

365
00:15:42.135 --> 00:15:43.305
while we're on that.

366
00:15:43.495 --> 00:15:45.494
How are we, essentially, different?

367
00:15:45.494 --> 00:15:47.854
<v ->I see this is going to be a problematic conversation.</v>

368
00:15:47.854 --> 00:15:49.524
(laughing)

369
00:15:49.813 --> 00:15:52.244
I bet your husband is not gonna like me when we get done.

370
00:15:52.774 --> 00:15:56.594
<v ->Well it's, he's an adult and he's evolved and</v>

371
00:15:56.594 --> 00:15:57.532
whatever it is,
<v ->Alright</v>

372
00:15:57.532 --> 00:15:58.251
<v ->we'll both handle it.</v>

373
00:15:58.251 --> 00:15:59.500
<v ->Okay, cool beans.</v>

374
00:15:59.551 --> 00:16:02.571
<v ->So what is essentially, the difference between</v>

375
00:16:02.571 --> 00:16:04.121
male and female brain?

376
00:16:04.831 --> 00:16:08.370
<v ->Number one, let me first tell my own wares, okay?</v>

377
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:09.271
<v ->Okay.</v>

378
00:16:09.271 --> 00:16:12.441
<v ->Number one, our brain's about 10% larger.</v>

379
00:16:12.751 --> 00:16:13.751
<v ->Okay.</v>

380
00:16:13.751 --> 00:16:17.471
<v ->Number two, our occipital lobes are probably,</v>

381
00:16:17.471 --> 00:16:20.141
considerably larger, maybe 20% or 30%.

382
00:16:20.651 --> 00:16:22.601
Occipital is where vision happens.

383
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.651
Now when you think about males, and you think about vision,

384
00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:27.261
you kinda put those two things,

385
00:16:27.261 --> 00:16:28.020
yeah, okay thank you very much.

386
00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.360
<v ->Yeah I get that portrait.</v>

387
00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.680
<v ->Now, so for the male side, that's true.</v>

388
00:16:34.197 --> 00:16:37.888
They tend to be more one sided, however.

389
00:16:38.217 --> 00:16:40.098
Because the connectivity seems

390
00:16:40.098 --> 00:16:41.818
between the left and the right brains,

391
00:16:43.036 --> 00:16:48.036
going from left being more detail, right being more context.

392
00:16:49.917 --> 00:16:51.157
Okay.

393
00:16:51.157 --> 00:16:52.337
Left being for more analytic,

394
00:16:52.337 --> 00:16:55.447
while right being more artistic, if you will.

395
00:16:56.497 --> 00:16:59.256
The connectivity back and forth for the male,

396
00:16:59.256 --> 00:17:03.386
is severely lacking, compared to the female.

397
00:17:03.837 --> 00:17:06.307
Now there are reasons for that, we believe.

398
00:17:07.497 --> 00:17:10.867
The reasons for that, that have been hypothesized,

399
00:17:12.277 --> 00:17:15.657
is simply that the female in prehistoric times,

400
00:17:15.657 --> 00:17:18.927
needed to remember very distinctly,

401
00:17:19.157 --> 00:17:23.157
about which water hole was safe

402
00:17:23.157 --> 00:17:26.354
for her and her family, for the children.

403
00:17:27.201 --> 00:17:29.891
The male however, needed to forget

404
00:17:30.361 --> 00:17:32.871
the fear he experienced on the hunt.

405
00:17:33.301 --> 00:17:33.981
<v ->Uh huh.</v>

406
00:17:33.981 --> 00:17:36.581
<v ->If you had a tyrannosaurus rex chasing you from the hunt,</v>

407
00:17:36.581 --> 00:17:38.581
you want you get that out of your system,

408
00:17:38.581 --> 00:17:40.279
because you're not gonna want to go out the next day.

409
00:17:40.279 --> 00:17:41.509
<v ->Right, right.</v>

410
00:17:42.199 --> 00:17:44.609
<v ->And so we forget stuff, easy, right?</v>

411
00:17:44.999 --> 00:17:46.398
And on the hand, and on the

412
00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:50.398
other hand, we're at to be very narrow.

413
00:17:50.398 --> 00:17:50.792
<v ->Focused.</v>

414
00:17:50.792 --> 00:17:52.223
<v ->Focused some times.</v>

415
00:17:52.292 --> 00:17:55.083
So when I get in front of my computer some times,

416
00:17:55.452 --> 00:17:57.793
people walk in the office, and talk to me for three minutes,

417
00:17:57.793 --> 00:17:59.612
and I will not know that they're there.

418
00:17:59.612 --> 00:18:01.962
And they think I'm really being, you know.

419
00:18:02.792 --> 00:18:03.573
<v ->Dismissive.</v>

420
00:18:03.573 --> 00:18:04.703
<v ->At least.</v>

421
00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:06.020
<v ->Yeah.</v>

422
00:18:06.909 --> 00:18:09.400
But that's not going on, you're not aware of them per say.

423
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.470
<v ->No, and so I had to figure this out,</v>

424
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:15.490
just for my own personal relationship possibilities,

425
00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.680
because they weren't working.

426
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:18.107
<v ->Right.</v>

427
00:18:18.107 --> 00:18:19.707
<v ->So, that somebody had to know,</v>

428
00:18:19.707 --> 00:18:21.667
hey I'm not a bad guy, I'm just not thinking

429
00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:23.887
about what you're thinking about, right.

430
00:18:23.887 --> 00:18:24.327
<v ->Right.</v>

431
00:18:24.327 --> 00:18:25.847
<v ->So, by the same token though,</v>

432
00:18:25.847 --> 00:18:28.797
the female can go back and forth.

433
00:18:29.207 --> 00:18:33.147
And so when you look at people in

434
00:18:33.147 --> 00:18:37.147
situational opportunities like, should I

435
00:18:37.147 --> 00:18:39.796
go into politics, or should I go into this, that?

436
00:18:39.827 --> 00:18:43.725
Well, it makes a lot of sense that what we'd really

437
00:18:43.725 --> 00:18:46.245
like to have, is somebody that can go back and forth

438
00:18:46.245 --> 00:18:49.535
between a creative and tactical application very quickly.

439
00:18:49.545 --> 00:18:51.765
<v ->It makes for good diplomatic relations it would seem.</v>

440
00:18:51.765 --> 00:18:52.225
<v ->Exactly.</v>

441
00:18:52.225 --> 00:18:52.785
<v ->Communication.</v>

442
00:18:52.785 --> 00:18:53.543
<v ->Yeah.</v>

443
00:18:53.543 --> 00:18:55.519
<v ->Mm hmm, so that's what your earlier comment</v>

444
00:18:55.519 --> 00:18:57.259
was about, about females should be much

445
00:18:57.259 --> 00:18:59.077
more present in the political arena.

446
00:18:59.077 --> 00:18:59.717
<v ->Yep.</v>

447
00:18:59.717 --> 00:19:00.817
<v ->And at the peace table.</v>

448
00:19:00.817 --> 00:19:01.374
<v ->Yep.</v>

449
00:19:01.374 --> 00:19:02.874
<v ->Yeah, all that makes sense.</v>

450
00:19:02.874 --> 00:19:06.474
And so, other than the female having the ability

451
00:19:06.474 --> 00:19:10.734
to move more quickly between the right and left functioning,

452
00:19:10.734 --> 00:19:13.834
are there any other features that are more enhanced

453
00:19:13.834 --> 00:19:16.624
or more deficient in general in the female brain?

454
00:19:17.094 --> 00:19:21.534
<v ->Well, because of that right or left movement okay,</v>

455
00:19:21.534 --> 00:19:26.234
at certain points in time, in the hormones,

456
00:19:26.234 --> 00:19:29.750
the system balance, would be more easily off.

457
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:30.350
<v ->Mm hmm.</v>

458
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:32.849
<v ->Okay, so what you'll find is often times,</v>

459
00:19:32.849 --> 00:19:35.660
you'll find females will be more emotional than males.

460
00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:38.090
Okay, you'll often find them to have

461
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:39.810
hormonal problems more than males.

462
00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:43.250
Though males have, especially after 40,

463
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:45.210
you'll seem to find those things.

464
00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:46.619
<v ->Mm hmm.</v>

465
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:49.610
So this has something to do with the miscommunication,

466
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.289
men are from Mars, women are from Venus

467
00:19:51.289 --> 00:19:54.210
type of dialogue that goes on, where women might

468
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.970
be looking for a certain type of communication style,

469
00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:00.710
where men are looking for, maybe a very pointed solution

470
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:04.799
oriented focus, shall we say, conversation.

471
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:06.050
<v ->I suppose.</v>

472
00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:07.070
<v ->Yeah, something like that.</v>

473
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.726
You've probably experienced a bit of that.

474
00:20:08.726 --> 00:20:09.837
<v ->Uh huh.</v>

475
00:20:10.127 --> 00:20:11.847
<v ->I'd like to hear some of the success stories,</v>

476
00:20:11.847 --> 00:20:13.667
some of the things that were particularly profound,

477
00:20:13.667 --> 00:20:18.397
and surprised even you, in the responses that you received.

478
00:20:18.406 --> 00:20:20.686
<v ->Okay, when we started,</v>

479
00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:24.286
when we finished with the students and then

480
00:20:24.286 --> 00:20:27.587
I developed an assessment process with the monks,

481
00:20:27.587 --> 00:20:29.487
remember, I am a Theologian.

482
00:20:29.487 --> 00:20:33.227
I am a psychotherapist, but I'm also at heart,

483
00:20:33.227 --> 00:20:35.857
a mathematician, a physicist, I'm a scientist at heart.

484
00:20:36.107 --> 00:20:41.107
So what I needed to do, was test out the,

485
00:20:41.126 --> 00:20:42.756
this was just a bunch of theory.

486
00:20:43.366 --> 00:20:44.645
And we needed to test that.

487
00:20:44.645 --> 00:20:46.095
We needed to test those theories.

488
00:20:46.205 --> 00:20:47.685
So we found ways to do that,

489
00:20:47.685 --> 00:20:49.785
and the only way I knew to do it,

490
00:20:49.785 --> 00:20:54.685
was to start applying the technology to people

491
00:20:55.244 --> 00:20:57.343
and see if we could condition their brains

492
00:20:57.343 --> 00:20:59.454
to enhance their life,

493
00:20:59.984 --> 00:21:01.594
and help them with various problems.

494
00:21:02.284 --> 00:21:07.284
We had success after success, and i didn't know why.

495
00:21:09.924 --> 00:21:12.094
I don't literally know why now.

496
00:21:12.384 --> 00:21:15.583
Okay, I don't want to play like I know something.

497
00:21:15.583 --> 00:21:16.894
<v ->Right.</v>

498
00:21:17.124 --> 00:21:18.774
<v ->What we do know is this.</v>

499
00:21:19.024 --> 00:21:22.464
That when you balance and harmonize a brain,

500
00:21:22.464 --> 00:21:24.254
various mythologies fall away.

501
00:21:25.544 --> 00:21:27.174
What we didn't know was,

502
00:21:31.198 --> 00:21:34.018
is it efficacious because of technology

503
00:21:34.018 --> 00:21:37.998
and what we've developed, or it efficacious somehow,

504
00:21:37.998 --> 00:21:40.818
about me, and or the people that are

505
00:21:40.818 --> 00:21:43.047
close to me training people.

506
00:21:43.537 --> 00:21:45.188
And so we had to figure that one out.

507
00:21:45.558 --> 00:21:48.198
Second thing we had to figure out was,

508
00:21:48.198 --> 00:21:52.618
is this just a hugely successful placebo, right?

509
00:21:52.618 --> 00:21:53.198
<v ->Right.</v>

510
00:21:53.198 --> 00:21:54.565
<v ->Or something else.</v>

511
00:21:55.356 --> 00:21:59.836
So to answer the first part, we opened up an office

512
00:21:59.836 --> 00:22:03.846
and we trained someone to apply the technology

513
00:22:04.096 --> 00:22:07.915
who is very good, but who wasn't very skilled

514
00:22:07.915 --> 00:22:12.515
at computers at all, and she wasn't skilled

515
00:22:12.515 --> 00:22:15.525
at psychotherapy, or you know.

516
00:22:15.876 --> 00:22:18.736
<v ->She was more, a technician, shall we say, in a sense?</v>

517
00:22:18.736 --> 00:22:21.806
<v ->Yes, but she had been a college</v>

518
00:22:22.316 --> 00:22:24.233
guidance counselor kind of position.

519
00:22:24.233 --> 00:22:26.664
<v ->Okay, so she had some background in counseling, okay.</v>

520
00:22:26.954 --> 00:22:28.534
<v ->And so she was a good listener,</v>

521
00:22:28.534 --> 00:22:30.724
and she had, she was a meditator herself.

522
00:22:30.813 --> 00:22:32.934
So that was hugely, that was good.

523
00:22:34.393 --> 00:22:37.863
So we trained her in a office in Prescott.

524
00:22:38.372 --> 00:22:41.893
And then we worked with the probation department

525
00:22:41.893 --> 00:22:43.763
to train people on probation.

526
00:22:44.113 --> 00:22:47.333
They averaged 33 years old, they averaged 20

527
00:22:47.333 --> 00:22:49.683
years of drug use, they averaged 7 arrests.

528
00:22:50.613 --> 00:22:52.262
Excuse me, 7 convictions.

529
00:22:52.713 --> 00:22:54.443
Some, many more arrests than that.

530
00:22:54.913 --> 00:22:58.693
So the question at hand was, could we reduce the

531
00:22:58.693 --> 00:23:03.413
60% roughly experience of having a dirty urine analysis,

532
00:23:03.413 --> 00:23:05.572
in other words, indicating they had taken drugs,

533
00:23:05.572 --> 00:23:07.233
over a three months period of time.

534
00:23:07.233 --> 00:23:09.333
Could we train people, condition their brain,

535
00:23:09.333 --> 00:23:11.392
and would they reduce that over that

536
00:23:11.392 --> 00:23:14.260
over that same three months period by half?

537
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.210
30%, which is aggressive, but which

538
00:23:17.887 --> 00:23:21.287
if our whole company is based on the fact

539
00:23:21.287 --> 00:23:23.817
that if we can't do something to X, we're not gonna do it.

540
00:23:23.927 --> 00:23:24.547
<v ->Right.</v>

541
00:23:24.547 --> 00:23:25.857
<v ->It's either to X or nothing.</v>

542
00:23:25.947 --> 00:23:30.947
We're big fat babies from the computer age,

543
00:23:31.167 --> 00:23:32.705
and that what we expect.
<v ->You want results, okay.</v>

544
00:23:32.705 --> 00:23:34.015
<v ->Yeah, that's what we expect.</v>

545
00:23:34.265 --> 00:23:36.645
So that's what we went after.

546
00:23:36.645 --> 00:23:40.354
And we were shooting for 30%, after three months we had 0%.

547
00:23:41.444 --> 00:23:43.585
None of them had dirty UA.

548
00:23:43.585 --> 00:23:44.365
<v ->Wow.</v>

549
00:23:44.365 --> 00:23:46.364
<v ->All of them had transformed the way they walk,</v>

550
00:23:46.364 --> 00:23:49.175
the way they talk, the way they thought, everything.

551
00:23:49.745 --> 00:23:53.235
And I just couldn't believe it, you know.

552
00:23:53.244 --> 00:23:54.524
<v ->Well that is startling.</v>

553
00:23:54.524 --> 00:23:55.344
<v ->I couldn't believe it.</v>

554
00:23:55.344 --> 00:23:58.683
So, second thing, second part of that trial was,

555
00:23:58.683 --> 00:24:01.923
is this efficacious because of it's

556
00:24:01.923 --> 00:24:04.764
manifestation as a placebo, a super placebo,

557
00:24:04.764 --> 00:24:09.514
or is the technology itself the tool?

558
00:24:10.223 --> 00:24:14.001
And so what we did is we took another couple of

559
00:24:14.001 --> 00:24:17.551
clients from Prescott, we also took some clients here,

560
00:24:17.761 --> 00:24:20.311
who were very adversarial to being here.

561
00:24:20.401 --> 00:24:21.741
<v ->Mm hmm.</v>

562
00:24:21.741 --> 00:24:23.417
<v ->In particular, I remember.</v>

563
00:24:23.417 --> 00:24:25.117
(laughs)

564
00:24:25.117 --> 00:24:28.077
I'm laughing because there's kind of a pay back

565
00:24:28.077 --> 00:24:29.317
in life, you know what.

566
00:24:29.317 --> 00:24:31.027
We call it karma, it comes around, it goes.

567
00:24:31.337 --> 00:24:35.997
Well, so I'm sitting in a pretrial meeting with the judge

568
00:24:35.997 --> 00:24:39.997
and defense attorney and psychotherapist,

569
00:24:39.997 --> 00:24:42.247
and psychologist, and various counselors.

570
00:24:42.857 --> 00:24:44.697
And they go around the table, and this individual

571
00:24:44.697 --> 00:24:47.816
who has had seventeen previous convictions,

572
00:24:47.816 --> 00:24:49.286
two files that big.

573
00:24:49.656 --> 00:24:52.136
they're going to put him away for 17 years.

574
00:24:52.136 --> 00:24:54.014
They've negotiated to 17 years.

575
00:24:54.014 --> 00:24:55.234
It could've been 22.

576
00:24:55.234 --> 00:24:58.384
And i said, your honor, can we have him for just a week?

577
00:24:59.933 --> 00:25:01.903
<v ->And the judge looked at me.</v>

578
00:25:01.993 --> 00:25:05.053
He thought, this is rude child right here,

579
00:25:05.053 --> 00:25:07.383
you know, we're not gonna play with him.

580
00:25:07.773 --> 00:25:12.043
So he said, tell you what, you pay for it, and it's a deal.

581
00:25:12.673 --> 00:25:14.283
And I said okay, here's the deal.

582
00:25:14.413 --> 00:25:16.893
You tell him then, today, that he goes

583
00:25:16.893 --> 00:25:20.773
to state prison for 17 years, from the court room,

584
00:25:20.773 --> 00:25:24.513
or he hangs out and goes to Brain State Technology,

585
00:25:24.513 --> 00:25:26.983
three times a day, for the next seven days.

586
00:25:27.993 --> 00:25:30.253
Except that, if he is five minutes late,

587
00:25:30.253 --> 00:25:31.413
there's a warrant for his arrest,

588
00:25:31.413 --> 00:25:33.423
and all things are stopped.

589
00:25:33.753 --> 00:25:36.783
Well, so the judge agreed, okay.

590
00:25:37.353 --> 00:25:39.833
Now, I don't train him.

591
00:25:39.833 --> 00:25:41.303
I have my son train him.

592
00:25:42.293 --> 00:25:43.493
It's working for us.

593
00:25:43.493 --> 00:25:45.573
<v ->Was he out on his own recognizance as well?</v>

594
00:25:45.573 --> 00:25:49.673
<v ->Yeah, he was out on probation, right until trial.</v>

595
00:25:50.852 --> 00:25:54.452
And so, Peter tells the story.

596
00:25:54.452 --> 00:25:55.792
I should have let him tell it actually.

597
00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.050
The guy comes in to the office.

598
00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:01.270
He's a great big guy, he's got tattoos all over him.

599
00:26:02.058 --> 00:26:03.978
And he's not happy about being there.

600
00:26:05.497 --> 00:26:08.337
<v ->Like he'd be happy for 17 more years in prison.</v>

601
00:26:08.337 --> 00:26:10.147
<v ->Well, but he's not happy about being there.</v>

602
00:26:10.147 --> 00:26:10.706
<v ->Okay.</v>

603
00:26:10.706 --> 00:26:13.407
<v ->Let's get this damn thing over. (imitates growling)</v>

604
00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.630
And so, he was very adversarial, okay.

605
00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:20.570
Seven days later, after many psych evals,

606
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.250
he's still out on probation.

607
00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:24.790
This is a year and a half later.

608
00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:29.800
He's had no arrests, had no dirty UAs, you know.

609
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.550
And he's working and taking care of himself.

610
00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.450
<v ->Did he say thank you?</v>

611
00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.190
<v ->He didn't have to.</v>

612
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.580
He's paying taxes for crying out loud.

613
00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:41.617
<v ->Wow, who needs a thank you?
<v ->Something you and I</v>

614
00:26:41.617 --> 00:26:42.296
don't have to do.

615
00:26:42.296 --> 00:26:43.456
<v ->There you go.</v>

616
00:26:43.456 --> 00:26:46.216
That's amazing, so he, at what point

617
00:26:46.216 --> 00:26:47.556
did he drop his resistance and

618
00:26:47.556 --> 00:26:49.896
did you start seeing the changes?

619
00:26:49.896 --> 00:26:50.916
<v ->About the second day.</v>

620
00:26:50.916 --> 00:26:52.126
<v ->Second day, wow.</v>

621
00:26:52.336 --> 00:26:55.695
<v ->Usually with, and then we're taken a number of kids</v>

622
00:26:55.695 --> 00:26:57.595
from juvenile detention.

623
00:26:57.595 --> 00:26:59.555
Their parents brought them here,

624
00:26:59.555 --> 00:27:01.565
and saying you either stay there or you come here.

625
00:27:01.575 --> 00:27:02.895
And they come here, and they're

626
00:27:02.895 --> 00:27:04.485
less than happy about being here.

627
00:27:04.855 --> 00:27:07.095
And generally for them, it's one or two sessions,

628
00:27:07.095 --> 00:27:08.725
and they're totally turned around.

629
00:27:10.555 --> 00:27:14.135
<v ->This is falling in the miraculous category,</v>

630
00:27:14.135 --> 00:27:15.535
and what do we do with these-

631
00:27:15.535 --> 00:27:16.515
<v ->It's actually not at all.</v>

632
00:27:16.515 --> 00:27:17.735
It's so boring, really.

633
00:27:17.735 --> 00:27:19.275
<v ->Well, like common standards of what</v>

634
00:27:20.012 --> 00:27:22.262
the modality is being used up until now.

635
00:27:22.472 --> 00:27:26.162
<v ->Let me explain why it's really not at all.</v>

636
00:27:26.312 --> 00:27:30.992
Because when we went there to deal with probationers,

637
00:27:30.992 --> 00:27:34.532
what we had assumed, was that we would see imbalances

638
00:27:34.532 --> 00:27:36.522
or let me give you an example.

639
00:27:36.812 --> 00:27:40.922
In two lobes of the brain, both sides,

640
00:27:41.832 --> 00:27:45.552
we might look at a set of frequencies,

641
00:27:45.552 --> 00:27:49.182
and we would expect those frequencies to be about the same.

642
00:27:49.272 --> 00:27:51.252
You know, to go up about as high,

643
00:27:51.252 --> 00:27:53.162
about as low on both sides, okay.

644
00:27:54.092 --> 00:27:58.272
However, when we somebody with maybe 20% higher

645
00:27:58.272 --> 00:28:01.312
on one side than the other, that's a imbalance,

646
00:28:01.312 --> 00:28:03.062
and we would train that to help them.

647
00:28:03.272 --> 00:28:04.792
We might do that for a golfer.

648
00:28:04.792 --> 00:28:06.192
We might do that for somebody.

649
00:28:06.192 --> 00:28:08.352
We might see the same thing with somebody who's depressed.

650
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:11.540
On and on, various people, we would see that.

651
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.990
Maybe some times we would see 50%.

652
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:16.270
Once in a great while, we would see

653
00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:17.970
something that would be 100%.

654
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:20.398
Be four on this side, it would be eight on this side, okay.

655
00:28:21.928 --> 00:28:26.928
For that population, we say 300%, 800%, 1600%.

656
00:28:29.908 --> 00:28:31.281
There was no doubt in the world,

657
00:28:31.281 --> 00:28:33.910
when they were self medicating, than they were rascals.

658
00:28:33.936 --> 00:28:35.136
<v ->Right.</v>

659
00:28:35.136 --> 00:28:36.157
<v ->You know, and there was no doubt</v>

660
00:28:36.157 --> 00:28:37.674
in the world why they changed.

661
00:28:37.674 --> 00:28:41.425
<v ->And by the way, 87% of them are still working,</v>

662
00:28:42.014 --> 00:28:45.644
no dirty UA, a year and a half later, and no arrests.

663
00:28:45.734 --> 00:28:47.085
<v ->Absolutely amazing.</v>

664
00:28:47.354 --> 00:28:49.774
What do we do with all the little kids who are on

665
00:28:49.774 --> 00:28:52.884
over-stimulation, over-driven now, taking Ritalin.

666
00:28:54.435 --> 00:28:56.072
<v ->We'll find a way, but we have to have</v>

667
00:28:56.072 --> 00:28:58.101
points of light or influence.

668
00:28:58.652 --> 00:29:01.911
We have to have people that they're able to look at

669
00:29:01.911 --> 00:29:04.781
and say, I want to be like her, I want to be like him.

670
00:29:05.411 --> 00:29:07.221
Right, that's what we need.

671
00:29:07.491 --> 00:29:09.841
<v ->But the parents really are the gate keepers.</v>

672
00:29:10.091 --> 00:29:11.871
<v ->I know, but you know what,</v>

673
00:29:11.871 --> 00:29:13.442
we haven't got any heroes anymore.

674
00:29:14.212 --> 00:29:16.111
I'm big on, I'm wanting to

675
00:29:16.111 --> 00:29:17.801
see some heroes.
<v ->Very true, very true.</v>

676
00:29:17.811 --> 00:29:19.071
<v ->We just haven't got em.</v>

677
00:29:19.071 --> 00:29:21.792
<v ->Well in the past, we had heroes, and then</v>

678
00:29:21.792 --> 00:29:23.471
that was before the media was able to get

679
00:29:23.471 --> 00:29:26.322
too deeply into their private lives as well.

680
00:29:26.491 --> 00:29:27.351
I mean, that's changed the

681
00:29:27.351 --> 00:29:28.430
hero, zero status.
<v ->That is true.</v>

682
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:29.971
Way to go, you did good work guys.

683
00:29:29.971 --> 00:29:31.620
(laughing)

684
00:29:31.731 --> 00:29:33.530
So let me tell you, let me give you an example

685
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.910
of what happens in a situation

686
00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:37.391
where one person in the family

687
00:29:37.391 --> 00:29:38.901
feels others are tarnished.

688
00:29:39.151 --> 00:29:41.740
Or they've lost respect for them.

689
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:45.160
What happens when we train that individual,

690
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:50.380
is that they develop their own nets and brain flexibility.

691
00:29:51.551 --> 00:29:56.121
And they are able to relate, to see in their own brain

692
00:29:56.571 --> 00:29:59.640
how these people could've made that error.

693
00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:03.001
You can call it forgiveness,

694
00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:05.449
okay, on the spiritual side.

695
00:30:05.449 --> 00:30:07.009
<v ->Or understanding.</v>

696
00:30:07.009 --> 00:30:08.938
<v ->You could call it understanding.</v>

697
00:30:09.148 --> 00:30:11.618
You know, we call it brain flexibility.

698
00:30:11.688 --> 00:30:14.579
You know, cause that's sort of nondenominational.

699
00:30:15.348 --> 00:30:17.309
But you could call it anything you want it.

700
00:30:17.309 --> 00:30:18.954
But the truth is that,

701
00:30:20.065 --> 00:30:23.124
and Doctor Tiller, who we work with as a scientist if-

702
00:30:23.124 --> 00:30:24.084
<v ->William Tiller.</v>

703
00:30:24.084 --> 00:30:28.693
<v ->Yes a scientist from Professor Emretis from Stanford.</v>

704
00:30:28.983 --> 00:30:32.613
He would call it being coupled with the

705
00:30:32.903 --> 00:30:34.934
reciprocal self in quantum space.

706
00:30:35.083 --> 00:30:36.934
You know, you can call it many things.

707
00:30:37.344 --> 00:30:38.664
but the truth of the matter is,

708
00:30:38.664 --> 00:30:40.194
the result is all the same.

709
00:30:40.863 --> 00:30:45.863
You add flexibility and oneness to your consciousness.

710
00:30:46.723 --> 00:30:48.552
And that's a huge, that's a big deal.

711
00:30:48.602 --> 00:30:50.342
That's really a big deal.
<v ->That's a really big deal.</v>

712
00:30:50.342 --> 00:30:51.812
<v ->That's a big deal, yeah.</v>

713
00:30:52.602 --> 00:30:53.142
<v ->Well-</v>

714
00:30:53.142 --> 00:30:55.452
<v ->Nobody comes in to us however, let me tell ya.</v>

715
00:30:55.502 --> 00:30:58.222
And says, "Hey guys, you know what I want today,

716
00:30:58.222 --> 00:30:59.060
"I want some one-ness man!"

717
00:30:59.060 --> 00:30:59.981
<v ->Oneness!</v>

718
00:30:59.981 --> 00:31:01.401
(laughs)

719
00:31:01.401 --> 00:31:03.458
<v ->They come in to us instead and say,</v>

720
00:31:03.458 --> 00:31:05.378
"Well I'm here so I don't have to go to jail."

721
00:31:05.378 --> 00:31:06.228
Oh okay.

722
00:31:07.259 --> 00:31:08.938
<v ->Good enough, they're on their way to one-ness.</v>

723
00:31:08.938 --> 00:31:10.088
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

724
00:31:10.438 --> 00:31:12.718
<v ->Well, would this be an appropriate time</v>

725
00:31:12.718 --> 00:31:15.398
to show us on the screen, some examples

726
00:31:15.398 --> 00:31:16.498
of what a balanced and highly evolved brain

727
00:31:16.498 --> 00:31:20.518
neuro-network would look like,

728
00:31:20.518 --> 00:31:22.238
compared to one that has been...

729
00:31:22.238 --> 00:31:23.649
<v ->Let me show you an actual recording of a session</v>

730
00:31:24.099 --> 00:31:27.098
of one that was out of balance,

731
00:31:27.098 --> 00:31:30.752
<v ->Okay.
<v ->and went back in.</v>

732
00:31:30.752 --> 00:31:31.690
<v ->Okay, perfect.
<v ->Because that may answer</v>

733
00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:32.526
all of those questions.

734
00:31:32.526 --> 00:31:33.385
<v ->Perfect.</v>

735
00:31:33.385 --> 00:31:35.285
<v ->In this case, what we're gonna see,</v>

736
00:31:35.285 --> 00:31:38.025
is we're gonna see a woman who came to us fine times.

737
00:31:38.025 --> 00:31:39.715
This was her sixth session.

738
00:31:40.026 --> 00:31:44.016
She was here as part of our weight management trial.

739
00:31:44.386 --> 00:31:45.684
We started a couple of years ago.

740
00:31:45.684 --> 00:31:47.835
We were developing a weight management protocol.

741
00:31:48.245 --> 00:31:53.024
But she was here for that, and in her sixth session

742
00:31:53.024 --> 00:31:54.665
she came in and she was crying

743
00:31:54.665 --> 00:31:56.325
and told us that this was the last time

744
00:31:56.325 --> 00:31:57.754
she could participate.

745
00:31:58.124 --> 00:32:00.614
In the previous two weeks, she had lost her job.

746
00:32:00.645 --> 00:32:04.035
Her husband had lost his job, and her mother had died.

747
00:32:04.705 --> 00:32:07.125
So that, she and her husband were moving to

748
00:32:07.125 --> 00:32:08.923
Southern California some place, the next day,

749
00:32:08.923 --> 00:32:12.913
where he had achieved an opportunity at work,

750
00:32:13.083 --> 00:32:14.623
an employment opportunity.

751
00:32:14.623 --> 00:32:17.723
So what we said to her, well I don't think

752
00:32:17.723 --> 00:32:19.853
weight management is quite applicable tonight.

753
00:32:20.024 --> 00:32:23.533
Why don't we instead take a look at your depression.

754
00:32:24.744 --> 00:32:28.504
And so she had a history of depression throughout her life.

755
00:32:28.504 --> 00:32:30.064
she had been on various meds.

756
00:32:30.641 --> 00:32:32.815
Again, the woman was over 40 years old.

757
00:32:33.085 --> 00:32:35.076
So what I'm going to show you here,

758
00:32:36.086 --> 00:32:40.076
is at the bottom of the screen right here,

759
00:32:41.064 --> 00:32:44.953
along this edge, or frequencies from 0 to 40.

760
00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:46.743
And we could actually think of having

761
00:32:46.743 --> 00:32:49.213
a 40 string guitar here, okay.

762
00:32:49.304 --> 00:32:50.201
<v Regina>Mm hmm.</v>

763
00:32:50.201 --> 00:32:53.182
<v Lee>That brain is going, we're going to capture</v>

764
00:32:53.182 --> 00:32:56.421
brain waves using an electrode like this.

765
00:32:56.421 --> 00:32:59.631
It has a little insert in it.

766
00:33:00.161 --> 00:33:02.961
On the computer then, we see these frequencies

767
00:33:02.961 --> 00:33:04.261
from 0 to 40.

768
00:33:04.261 --> 00:33:08.301
Now what we do is, in this particular screen,

769
00:33:08.301 --> 00:33:11.592
we're going to display those frequencies in color.

770
00:33:11.862 --> 00:33:12.443
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

771
00:33:12.443 --> 00:33:15.623
<v Lee>So, how hard you hit each of those strings</v>

772
00:33:15.623 --> 00:33:20.043
on 40 string guitar, zero being the lowest base,

773
00:33:20.043 --> 00:33:21.773
40 being the highest.

774
00:33:22.583 --> 00:33:25.023
How hard you hit them will be revealed

775
00:33:25.023 --> 00:33:26.553
by the color of them.

776
00:33:26.902 --> 00:33:28.942
So, how much energy they have,

777
00:33:28.942 --> 00:33:31.323
how loud they are, effectively.

778
00:33:31.323 --> 00:33:33.463
This woman knows that she doesn't want to be depressed.

779
00:33:33.463 --> 00:33:35.893
And therefore she wants her brain to do her bidding.

780
00:33:36.203 --> 00:33:39.993
Okay, so as we start this, to replay this,

781
00:33:41.023 --> 00:33:44.073
you see that this bar is clear at the bottom.

782
00:33:44.603 --> 00:33:48.523
And you see that this activity for her brain at this place,

783
00:33:48.523 --> 00:33:50.122
is very, very low.

784
00:33:50.122 --> 00:33:50.702
<v Regina>Right.</v>

785
00:33:50.702 --> 00:33:51.762
<v Lee>All over.</v>

786
00:33:51.762 --> 00:33:53.232
She's depressed, right.

787
00:33:53.242 --> 00:33:55.710
And that's what, something that you would expect, right.

788
00:33:56.119 --> 00:33:58.270
Press down, very little activity.

789
00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.390
Lethargic, all of those things.

790
00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:03.810
Now you do see some energy that come up here, right?

791
00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.470
See it come here, see it here and here.

792
00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.900
Well I'll pause this for a second.

793
00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:10.159
This energy comes up here,

794
00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:13.037
but you'll see a slight little line along there.

795
00:34:13.037 --> 00:34:13.948
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

796
00:34:14.418 --> 00:34:16.538
<v Lee>This slight blue line is just at</v>

797
00:34:16.538 --> 00:34:20.028
the top of the subconscious.

798
00:34:21.556 --> 00:34:25.476
So what you have here, is you have a way

799
00:34:25.476 --> 00:34:29.566
to see and understand brain wave patterns.

800
00:34:29.756 --> 00:34:30.915
<v Regina>Very interesting.</v>

801
00:34:30.915 --> 00:34:34.666
<v Lee>When, if I had a pipe sitting here,</v>

802
00:34:35.856 --> 00:34:39.585
and the bottom of the pipe was zero,

803
00:34:39.935 --> 00:34:42.106
and the top of the subconscious was here,

804
00:34:42.255 --> 00:34:45.486
this part would be pushed out a little bit.

805
00:34:45.776 --> 00:34:49.766
But then, right above it, it's black.

806
00:34:50.136 --> 00:34:51.746
And this part would be squeezed.

807
00:34:52.396 --> 00:34:53.686
Now think about that.

808
00:34:53.736 --> 00:34:56.606
When if you did that with water, coming in from the bottom,

809
00:34:56.615 --> 00:34:58.215
and squeeze it, all you would do

810
00:34:58.215 --> 00:35:01.196
is shoot a stream out, just like a nozzle on a hose.

811
00:35:02.215 --> 00:35:06.395
In this case though, what we see here,

812
00:35:06.395 --> 00:35:08.314
is this energy comes in from the bottom

813
00:35:08.314 --> 00:35:10.864
and it can't get past the subconscious.

814
00:35:11.714 --> 00:35:13.045
Can't go any further.

815
00:35:13.275 --> 00:35:16.194
Now what she's hearing during this time,

816
00:35:16.194 --> 00:35:20.925
is she's hearing the sounds made by her brain

817
00:35:21.375 --> 00:35:24.373
when her brain fires close to the area

818
00:35:24.373 --> 00:35:27.523
that we want it to fire in, to be optimized.

819
00:35:28.453 --> 00:35:30.593
Now, I'm sorry we don't have speakers,

820
00:35:31.132 --> 00:35:33.142
or you could hear it, but

821
00:35:34.412 --> 00:35:38.042
the fact is, that as we continue now,

822
00:35:38.451 --> 00:35:40.592
the brain keeps getting this feedback,

823
00:35:40.592 --> 00:35:42.301
and it keeps getting the feedback.

824
00:35:42.331 --> 00:35:45.902
So now we're at 37 seconds.

825
00:35:46.371 --> 00:35:47.952
You don't see very much activity,

826
00:35:47.952 --> 00:35:51.472
but you can see very slight activity right up in there.

827
00:35:51.472 --> 00:35:53.851
Just slight lines of activity are developing,

828
00:35:53.851 --> 00:35:55.022
but very slight.

829
00:35:55.249 --> 00:36:00.249
And again, you see most of the brain, very subdued.

830
00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:01.710
<v Regina>Not much going on there.</v>

831
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:03.180
<v Lee>Not much going on indeed.</v>

832
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:05.559
And now,

833
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:08.420
coming up here,

834
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:15.440
you see it start to have a little bit of energy here.

835
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:17.060
Very, very little, but a little.

836
00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:19.260
And now you see again,

837
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:20.760
and I'll pause it.

838
00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:23.419
Now you see this energy come in from the bottom.

839
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:25.669
And this time, for some reason-

840
00:36:25.669 --> 00:36:26.970
<v Regina>It's permeating.</v>

841
00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:27.830
<v Lee>Exactly.</v>

842
00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:28.566
<v Regina>It's gotten through</v>

843
00:36:28.566 --> 00:36:30.087
the barrier of the subconscious.

844
00:36:30.087 --> 00:36:30.707
<v Lee>Exactly.</v>

845
00:36:30.707 --> 00:36:31.327
<v Regina>Uh huh.</v>

846
00:36:31.327 --> 00:36:32.407
<v Lee>And she's starting to</v>

847
00:36:32.407 --> 00:36:34.667
come out of depression right now.

848
00:36:34.667 --> 00:36:35.467
<v Regina>Wow.</v>

849
00:36:35.467 --> 00:36:39.236
<v Lee>And this is a minute and 13 seconds.</v>

850
00:36:39.966 --> 00:36:41.517
Now, what does the brain do?

851
00:36:41.727 --> 00:36:44.607
Is it happy with its being relegated

852
00:36:44.607 --> 00:36:46.757
to an administrative assistant?

853
00:36:47.007 --> 00:36:48.447
You think the ego likes that?

854
00:36:48.447 --> 00:36:49.557
Uh-uh.

855
00:36:50.527 --> 00:36:51.987
It shuts down again,

856
00:36:52.985 --> 00:36:54.545
it shuts down again, right away.

857
00:36:54.545 --> 00:36:56.785
<v Regina>So that's it's own internal</v>

858
00:36:56.785 --> 00:36:58.625
subconscious resistance almost.

859
00:36:58.625 --> 00:36:59.465
<v Lee>Absolutely.</v>

860
00:36:59.465 --> 00:37:00.005
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

861
00:37:00.005 --> 00:37:03.494
<v Lee>Now, again, boom.</v>

862
00:37:03.665 --> 00:37:05.203
This time it allows it up.

863
00:37:05.203 --> 00:37:06.793
<v Regina>Mm, big spike.</v>

864
00:37:06.923 --> 00:37:08.323
<v Lee>And this time though,</v>

865
00:37:08.323 --> 00:37:09.833
it immediately goes dark again.

866
00:37:10.523 --> 00:37:14.653
Again, allows it up, and immediately goes dark again.

867
00:37:15.302 --> 00:37:16.832
Okay, this is the game.

868
00:37:16.942 --> 00:37:18.632
Who's gonna be in command?

869
00:37:18.842 --> 00:37:20.112
That's the game.

870
00:37:20.842 --> 00:37:25.842
Now this time however, the brain says, I like my music.

871
00:37:27.582 --> 00:37:28.752
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

872
00:37:28.882 --> 00:37:30.182
<v Lee>And here she is.</v>

873
00:37:30.182 --> 00:37:31.792
Now she's getting out of depression.

874
00:37:32.142 --> 00:37:35.229
And this is in a minute and 53 sedconds.

875
00:37:35.999 --> 00:37:37.819
So if we move this down here, so you don't

876
00:37:37.819 --> 00:37:40.839
have to watch it all, to say, 5 minutes.

877
00:37:40.839 --> 00:37:43.149
This is 4 minutes and 43 seconds.

878
00:37:44.699 --> 00:37:45.339
Boom.

879
00:37:45.339 --> 00:37:46.539
<v Regina>Look at that.</v>

880
00:37:46.539 --> 00:37:47.419
Whole different brain.

881
00:37:47.419 --> 00:37:48.569
<v Lee>Now we're cooking.</v>

882
00:37:48.579 --> 00:37:49.489
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

883
00:37:49.519 --> 00:37:52.309
<v Lee>Now usually, when we activate a brain,</v>

884
00:37:52.959 --> 00:37:57.369
we don't activate it longer than say, six to ten minutes.

885
00:37:57.979 --> 00:38:01.059
But for her, because of the fact that she was

886
00:38:01.059 --> 00:38:03.739
in this special circumstance, remember she's

887
00:38:03.739 --> 00:38:06.239
leaving the next day, so we won't see her again,

888
00:38:06.239 --> 00:38:11.239
we went ahead and we ran her to 17 minutes,

889
00:38:12.059 --> 00:38:15.449
and now you see euphoric brain.

890
00:38:15.799 --> 00:38:16.919
<v Regina>Wow.</v>

891
00:38:16.919 --> 00:38:19.469
<v Lee>And she is very high.</v>

892
00:38:19.559 --> 00:38:21.438
<v Regina>It's a different, it looks like an entirely</v>

893
00:38:21.438 --> 00:38:24.558
different life from 17 minutes ago.

894
00:38:24.558 --> 00:38:26.158
<v Lee>And it was a different life.</v>

895
00:38:26.158 --> 00:38:28.458
She's not thinking about how she might

896
00:38:28.458 --> 00:38:30.238
do away with herself here, she's thinking about

897
00:38:30.238 --> 00:38:32.068
how luck her husband's gonna get that night.

898
00:38:32.378 --> 00:38:33.668
Literally telling us that.

899
00:38:33.698 --> 00:38:34.538
<v Regina>Wow.</v>

900
00:38:34.538 --> 00:38:35.217
<v Lee>And she's thinking about</v>

901
00:38:35.217 --> 00:38:36.397
what she's gonna fix for dinner,

902
00:38:36.397 --> 00:38:38.237
and she's thinking about all the cool things

903
00:38:38.237 --> 00:38:41.786
they could do in California, and she's yada, yada, okay.

904
00:38:42.136 --> 00:38:43.676
Totally different person.
<v Regina>Incredible.</v>

905
00:38:43.676 --> 00:38:45.645
<v Lee>Now, she doesn't sleep this night.</v>

906
00:38:46.215 --> 00:38:48.505
And the next night, she only sleeps half the night.

907
00:38:48.995 --> 00:38:53.175
After that, she resumed regular sleep pattern.

908
00:38:53.175 --> 00:38:55.645
And in 18 months, she hasn't had depression again.

909
00:38:55.955 --> 00:38:57.135
<v Regina>That's amazing.</v>

910
00:38:57.135 --> 00:38:58.985
<v Lee>But this is the exception, not the rule.</v>

911
00:38:59.355 --> 00:39:02.305
Usually to treat this, takes ten to thirty sessions.

912
00:39:03.135 --> 00:39:05.345
And usually it's an investment.

913
00:39:05.815 --> 00:39:08.993
And we don't usually let it go this long.

914
00:39:08.993 --> 00:39:10.613
Some times I think, maybe we should

915
00:39:10.613 --> 00:39:13.653
have a little bit more courage, and do that.

916
00:39:13.653 --> 00:39:18.653
But still, the big thing is, to do no harm.

917
00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:20.795
Now, good point.

918
00:39:20.795 --> 00:39:21.394
<v ->Right.</v>

919
00:39:21.394 --> 00:39:23.033
I want to touch on that one if I may.

920
00:39:23.033 --> 00:39:24.224
<v ->Uh huh.</v>

921
00:39:24.693 --> 00:39:28.443
<v ->After I found out that we could assess things,</v>

922
00:39:28.453 --> 00:39:31.234
and we could help people with this technology,

923
00:39:31.234 --> 00:39:33.754
then the next question on my mind is,

924
00:39:33.754 --> 00:39:35.524
well can we hurt people?

925
00:39:36.631 --> 00:39:37.211
<v ->Good question.</v>

926
00:39:37.211 --> 00:39:39.282
<v ->Yeah, we can help them, can we hurt them?</v>

927
00:39:39.851 --> 00:39:43.041
So I packed up all my little geek gear.

928
00:39:43.171 --> 00:39:45.972
And took all this stuff that I take.

929
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:47.971
Trotted off-

930
00:39:47.971 --> 00:39:49.330
<v ->And your pocket protector?</v>

931
00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:51.241
<v ->At least, how did you know?</v>

932
00:39:52.188 --> 00:39:56.258
Then I went up into a cabin, you know, in Minnesota.

933
00:39:56.308 --> 00:39:57.427
You got a lot of cabins.

934
00:39:57.427 --> 00:39:58.347
<v ->Yeah.</v>

935
00:39:58.347 --> 00:40:00.647
<v ->I spend a month there, three weeks plus,</v>

936
00:40:00.647 --> 00:40:05.647
and I train myself in every way I could, that was wrong.

937
00:40:07.467 --> 00:40:10.128
So I did the assessment, and then I trained myself

938
00:40:10.128 --> 00:40:11.277
in every way I could.

939
00:40:11.628 --> 00:40:13.268
So I did brain state conditioning on

940
00:40:13.268 --> 00:40:15.857
every incorrect way I could imagine.

941
00:40:16.407 --> 00:40:19.528
And then took copious notes and found out that

942
00:40:19.528 --> 00:40:21.867
yeah, some times if I train myself wrong,

943
00:40:21.867 --> 00:40:24.516
I wouldn't feel so good for the next hour or two.

944
00:40:24.786 --> 00:40:27.416
But the brain immediately would go back to homeostasis.

945
00:40:27.467 --> 00:40:29.136
<v ->So you were doing all of this on yourself.</v>

946
00:40:29.525 --> 00:40:30.325
<v ->Yeah.
<v ->Okay.</v>

947
00:40:30.325 --> 00:40:31.523
<v ->Yeah.</v>

948
00:40:31.523 --> 00:40:32.022
<v ->If I can't do it</v>

949
00:40:32.022 --> 00:40:33.142
on myself,
<v ->Fair enough.</v>

950
00:40:33.142 --> 00:40:34.223
<v ->can't do it on anybody else.</v>

951
00:40:34.223 --> 00:40:34.962
<v ->Yeah.</v>

952
00:40:34.962 --> 00:40:36.201
<v ->So, but the brain immediately</v>

953
00:40:36.201 --> 00:40:37.811
went back to homeostasis.

954
00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:40.760
And so after I did that for a three week period,

955
00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.020
I said, naa, this is enough.

956
00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:45.150
I'm convinced, I'm ready to go.

957
00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:46.919
The second piece of the matter is,

958
00:40:46.919 --> 00:40:49.860
this is a 30 year science, or 30 year old science,

959
00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.219
and in this science, there's never been

960
00:40:51.219 --> 00:40:55.000
anybody known to have a serious

961
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.390
problem from training incorrectly.

962
00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:00.680
So the ability to harm someone is as

963
00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.889
close to zero as we could possibly get.

964
00:41:04.819 --> 00:41:07.460
So I was convinced of that, and now

965
00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.590
I'm ready to proceed.

966
00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:14.399
<v ->In summary, what are you looking to do</v>

967
00:41:14.399 --> 00:41:16.749
with this in terms of your offering to the world?

968
00:41:16.897 --> 00:41:18.856
What are you hoping to achieve, pic picture?

969
00:41:18.856 --> 00:41:21.926
<v ->We do something exceedingly well.</v>

970
00:41:22.396 --> 00:41:26.426
And that is, we marry technology with human need.

971
00:41:27.316 --> 00:41:28.366
That's what we do.

972
00:41:28.656 --> 00:41:30.536
So what we're doing, taking it to the world,

973
00:41:30.536 --> 00:41:34.686
is we're going to have various providers of the service,

974
00:41:35.036 --> 00:41:37.046
and then we're gonna collect all the data,

975
00:41:37.436 --> 00:41:40.286
and then we're gonna hone, and hone, and hone, and hone,

976
00:41:40.796 --> 00:41:42.986
our protocol, and our processes

977
00:41:43.236 --> 00:41:46.456
technologically, such that we're gonna come up to be

978
00:41:46.456 --> 00:41:49.766
able to say things that you never thought possible.

979
00:41:50.096 --> 00:41:54.606
For instance, here's a propensity to to have breast cancer.

980
00:41:55.056 --> 00:41:56.596
Here's a propensity for this.

981
00:41:56.596 --> 00:41:58.356
Here's a propensity for that.

982
00:41:58.356 --> 00:42:00.696
Or when you have it, here's the way

983
00:42:00.696 --> 00:42:02.706
to train it to reduce it of get rid of it.

984
00:42:03.396 --> 00:42:04.836
That's what we'ere gonna be able to do.

985
00:42:04.836 --> 00:42:06.746
And we're gonna be able to do it in two years or less.

986
00:42:09.056 --> 00:42:11.156
<v ->If you enjoyed this incredible information,</v>

987
00:42:11.156 --> 00:42:13.796
you might also enjoy the words of Burton Goldberg,

988
00:42:13.796 --> 00:42:15.956
who addresses cancer in some of the new insights

989
00:42:15.956 --> 00:42:18.736
and diagnostics available in this field.
