00:00:08.982 --> 00:00:10.423
<v Regina Meredith>How any of you have noticed the</v>

3
00:00:10.423 --> 00:00:13.072
cycles of abuse that play out from one generation

4
00:00:13.072 --> 00:00:15.139
of family members to another?

5
00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.832
And how often do we watch in bewilderment, thinking,

6
00:00:17.832 --> 00:00:19.980
"Why would they do that to their son, when the father

7
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.443
did the same to them?"

8
00:00:21.443 --> 00:00:23.149
They know the pain.

9
00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:25.576
Cynthia James was the product of five generations

10
00:00:25.576 --> 00:00:28.711
of abusive behavior against the women in her bloodline.

11
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:30.522
But the cycle stopped with her.

12
00:00:30.522 --> 00:00:33.018
After a lifetime of pain, followed by gaining

13
00:00:33.018 --> 00:00:36.287
two Masters degrees, one in psychospiritual healing,

14
00:00:36.287 --> 00:00:38.957
she realized that enter into family agreements

15
00:00:38.957 --> 00:00:41.767
to heal that which has not been healed.

16
00:00:43.637 --> 00:00:47.164
<v Regina>Cynthia, as the pressure around the world mounts,</v>

17
00:00:47.164 --> 00:00:50.508
and I'm talking about everything from political structures

18
00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:53.074
to financial and economic structures,

19
00:00:53.074 --> 00:00:55.245
to birds falling out on the fly and

20
00:00:55.245 --> 00:00:56.917
buffaloes and cows dying.

21
00:00:56.917 --> 00:00:58.780
People are beginning to feel a certain kind of

22
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.965
tension and anxiety and we hear from people

23
00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:04.074
around the world that this is beginning to affect them.

24
00:01:05.104 --> 00:01:06.517
And when that happens,

25
00:01:06.517 --> 00:01:09.336
in which we get into your specialty now,

26
00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:11.928
people's subconcsious programs become very

27
00:01:11.928 --> 00:01:14.250
close to the surface and vulnerable.

28
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.154
Where in good times, you can kind of

29
00:01:16.154 --> 00:01:18.034
stave it off a bit.

30
00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:21.668
And I am interested in talking to you about this because

31
00:01:21.668 --> 00:01:22.736
you have been through it all

32
00:01:22.736 --> 00:01:25.810
and generations of your women, the women in your family

33
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:26.866
have been through it all,

34
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:28.329
and found your way out of this.

35
00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.582
And we need to talk about genuine skills

36
00:01:30.582 --> 00:01:32.613
on a psychospiritual level verse coping

37
00:01:32.613 --> 00:01:33.914
with this type of stress so we don't

38
00:01:33.914 --> 00:01:37.592
end up killing each other as this continues developing.

39
00:01:37.592 --> 00:01:40.880
And your family is a beautiful example of

40
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.852
incarnation patterns, DNA, abuse

41
00:01:43.852 --> 00:01:45.117
and finding your way out.

42
00:01:45.117 --> 00:01:46.464
And can you give us some of that?

43
00:01:46.464 --> 00:01:48.049
Can you give us a little background?

44
00:01:48.101 --> 00:01:50.864
<v Cynthia>Yeah, I was going through a Masters program</v>

45
00:01:50.864 --> 00:01:53.732
in Spiritual Psychology at the University of Santa Monica

46
00:01:53.732 --> 00:01:56.739
and part of the curriculum was we had to do a genogram.

47
00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.013
And so, I had my grandmother's journals,

48
00:02:00.013 --> 00:02:02.207
I was talking to my mother, I mean I,

49
00:02:02.207 --> 00:02:05.214
my aunts, and I started tracing five

50
00:02:05.214 --> 00:02:08.418
generations of women had been abused, violated.

51
00:02:08.418 --> 00:02:12.052
My great, great grandmother had been raped on a hill

52
00:02:12.892 --> 00:02:15.908
by a slave master in front of everyone and

53
00:02:15.908 --> 00:02:18.032
conceived a child, and of course,

54
00:02:18.032 --> 00:02:19.657
you know.
<v Regina>Gave me the chills.</v>

55
00:02:19.657 --> 00:02:20.632
Yeah.

56
00:02:20.632 --> 00:02:23.642
So treated the child, hated the child, of course.

57
00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:24.292
<v Regina>Right.</v>

58
00:02:24.292 --> 00:02:26.288
<v ->And so, I didn't know at that time,</v>

59
00:02:26.288 --> 00:02:29.307
because I hadn't delved deep into what I do today,

60
00:02:29.307 --> 00:02:33.010
that those patterns just got carried on

61
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.240
and when I started tracking, there were even

62
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.351
similar experiences.

63
00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:42.922
My father, my mother's father would lock her

64
00:02:42.922 --> 00:02:45.689
underneath the house for punishment.

65
00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.963
And when I was a three year old, the woman who took

66
00:02:48.963 --> 00:02:51.099
care of me would lock me in the basement.

67
00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.527
Now what that said to me is that

68
00:02:52.527 --> 00:02:54.698
there was energetics in the body that were

69
00:02:54.698 --> 00:02:56.161
attracting itself.

70
00:02:56.991 --> 00:03:00.004
And what I learned was is that, when a wound happens,

71
00:03:00.004 --> 00:03:03.045
the natural state of the whole body and your

72
00:03:03.045 --> 00:03:06.073
energetic, your soul, is to like bring it back to wholeness.

73
00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:09.310
But if something happens and it's strong enough,

74
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.960
and you make a decision,

75
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.078
an intellectual or a spiritual or emotional decision,

76
00:03:13.078 --> 00:03:15.396
it keeps attracting itself until it heals.

77
00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:16.102
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

78
00:03:16.102 --> 00:03:19.294
<v ->So five generations of women and at one point,</v>

79
00:03:19.294 --> 00:03:20.335
you know,

80
00:03:21.285 --> 00:03:23.105
my path of discovery has been relationships,

81
00:03:23.105 --> 00:03:27.026
and so after relationship after relationship, I was like oh

82
00:03:27.026 --> 00:03:27.769
<v Regina>Seeing a few patterns?</v>

83
00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.236
<v ->Yes, exactly! And the common thread is me.</v>

84
00:03:31.636 --> 00:03:33.466
And it was like, okay.

85
00:03:33.466 --> 00:03:37.206
So I need to get to the fact that

86
00:03:37.206 --> 00:03:39.539
there's something in me that needs to be healed.

87
00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:42.244
And if that quantum physicists are right,

88
00:03:42.244 --> 00:03:43.718
and there's no time and space,

89
00:03:43.718 --> 00:03:47.050
if I heal, I affect the patterns of all the

90
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.581
generations before me and those to come.

91
00:03:49.581 --> 00:03:51.735
And so that started my work.

92
00:03:51.926 --> 00:03:53.656
<v Regina>That's a really profound place to come from</v>

93
00:03:53.656 --> 00:03:55.363
as a context for your work.

94
00:03:55.363 --> 00:03:56.207
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

95
00:03:56.207 --> 00:03:57.824
<v Regina>And I think everybody watching this</v>

96
00:03:57.824 --> 00:03:59.334
has watched some of the other interviews

97
00:03:59.334 --> 00:04:02.027
and read a great enough amount that they understand

98
00:04:02.027 --> 00:04:04.686
the depth of that statement that you just made.

99
00:04:04.686 --> 00:04:07.437
And so let's begin from there, where you have

100
00:04:07.857 --> 00:04:11.234
a bruise that's very deep trauma within the being.

101
00:04:11.234 --> 00:04:13.045
And let's take again the milieu of the times,

102
00:04:13.045 --> 00:04:14.763
which is a lot of stress.

103
00:04:14.763 --> 00:04:15.231
<v ->Right.</v>

104
00:04:15.231 --> 00:04:16.774
<v Regina>Say maybe you just lost your job,</v>

105
00:04:16.774 --> 00:04:18.643
meaning you have to leave your house and downsize

106
00:04:18.643 --> 00:04:22.022
because perhaps that's also put your house in jeopardy.

107
00:04:22.022 --> 00:04:25.214
And look at a normal scenario developing in society today.

108
00:04:25.214 --> 00:04:26.759
And then let's take a couple of examples

109
00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:29.893
that may be fictitious or that you know of at this time.

110
00:04:29.893 --> 00:04:32.831
And how that, what the started triggering in the person.

111
00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:34.828
And then, what goes from there.

112
00:04:35.688 --> 00:04:39.030
<v ->I want to start by saying that, everything that you're</v>

113
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.424
saying is accurate.

114
00:04:40.424 --> 00:04:43.477
I mean the energy, we're living in an accelerated

115
00:04:43.477 --> 00:04:45.276
amazing time on this planet.

116
00:04:45.276 --> 00:04:47.239
And I really believe that we all chose to be here

117
00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:49.340
at this time.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

118
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.186
<v ->And there is something in me,</v>

119
00:04:51.186 --> 00:04:52.742
when I have these conversations

120
00:04:52.742 --> 00:04:55.551
that's very calm, because I don't think that it's bad.

121
00:04:55.551 --> 00:04:56.782
I think that what's happening is that

122
00:04:56.782 --> 00:04:59.092
there's a transformation beyond what we could

123
00:04:59.092 --> 00:05:00.695
possibly ever imagine
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

124
00:05:01.695 --> 00:05:05.381
So the experience of it

125
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:08.301
becomes our opportunity

126
00:05:08.301 --> 00:05:09.727
to stand in another place.

127
00:05:09.727 --> 00:05:13.372
And so, those triggers are just indicators for me

128
00:05:13.372 --> 00:05:16.328
that say, okay, are you willing,

129
00:05:16.328 --> 00:05:18.838
or how willing are you,

130
00:05:18.838 --> 00:05:20.656
to go deep into your psyche,

131
00:05:20.656 --> 00:05:23.836
and to your wellness center

132
00:05:23.836 --> 00:05:26.283
and call up who you came here to be?

133
00:05:26.283 --> 00:05:29.150
And I think it's an essence of remembrance.

134
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.943
It's a process of learning

135
00:05:31.943 --> 00:05:35.063
that we are here to do this work

136
00:05:35.063 --> 00:05:36.557
on a lot of different levels.

137
00:05:36.557 --> 00:05:39.390
You can not just do it on an intellectual level.

138
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.399
You know, otherwise all the self-help books

139
00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:43.187
that have flown off the shelves,

140
00:05:43.187 --> 00:05:44.928
we'd all be, like enlightened, you know.

141
00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:45.409
<v Regina>Right.</v>

142
00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:47.635
<v ->So that, it's not happening, so, so the thing is</v>

143
00:05:47.635 --> 00:05:50.468
is that we have to learn and have those a-has,

144
00:05:50.468 --> 00:05:52.744
but then we have to go into the understanding that there's a

145
00:05:52.744 --> 00:05:56.210
mind-body connection, we have to challenge and change those

146
00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.450
energetic centers and what they mean to us

147
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.378
because they will continue to vibrate and attract

148
00:06:00.378 --> 00:06:02.588
themselves until we do.

149
00:06:02.588 --> 00:06:04.559
<v Regina>They will. I see it all around me.</v>

150
00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:05.517
I see it in me.

151
00:06:05.517 --> 00:06:06.451
<v ->Exactly.</v>

152
00:06:06.451 --> 00:06:09.226
And when you start looking, those patterns

153
00:06:09.226 --> 00:06:12.421
just recycle and recycle and recycle.

154
00:06:12.421 --> 00:06:14.041
And they escalate.

155
00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:16.227
And they escalate until you wake up,

156
00:06:16.227 --> 00:06:18.503
and some people call it the spiritual 2x4,

157
00:06:18.843 --> 00:06:22.334
but until you wake up and say, okay, I am called

158
00:06:22.334 --> 00:06:23.774
to do this differently.

159
00:06:23.774 --> 00:06:26.340
What's it going to take, and I willing to walk

160
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.280
through the fire?

161
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.310
And that for me, I had to walk through the fire

162
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.493
of my beliefs, my choices,

163
00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:37.624
the self-sabotage, the lack of self-esteem.

164
00:06:37.624 --> 00:06:38.426
All of that.

165
00:06:38.426 --> 00:06:41.640
Because my mother, in an act,

166
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.234
or trying to get out of the patterns,

167
00:06:45.234 --> 00:06:48.933
married a man who was excruciatingly violent to her,

168
00:06:48.933 --> 00:06:52.706
sexually abused me, I mean the house was chaotic.

169
00:06:52.706 --> 00:06:56.924
And so, at six years old, you think that's normal.

170
00:06:57.234 --> 00:07:00.473
And so you start encoding all that stuff

171
00:07:00.473 --> 00:07:04.142
and you really unconsciously look for it

172
00:07:04.142 --> 00:07:06.348
because it's what's familiar.

173
00:07:06.348 --> 00:07:08.623
And so I just kept creating, over and over,

174
00:07:08.623 --> 00:07:12.559
chaotic, violent relationships until I said, you know,

175
00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:14.788
maybe there's something more.

176
00:07:14.788 --> 00:07:16.855
And when I walked on the spiritual path,

177
00:07:16.855 --> 00:07:18.991
and said, oh.

178
00:07:18.991 --> 00:07:22.497
Well, if God is real and loves me,

179
00:07:22.497 --> 00:07:25.098
and love is the essence of everything,

180
00:07:25.098 --> 00:07:28.499
why am I experiencing this other stuff?

181
00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:30.311
There is something in me that thinks

182
00:07:30.311 --> 00:07:33.143
that that is what I am supposed to have

183
00:07:33.143 --> 00:07:36.104
as opposed to the truth of who I came here to be.

184
00:07:36.104 --> 00:07:37.891
<v Regina>And doesn't that really play into</v>

185
00:07:37.891 --> 00:07:39.195
the word resonance?
<v ->Yes.</v>

186
00:07:39.195 --> 00:07:41.848
<v Regina>There's a resonance field that's created on a</v>

187
00:07:41.848 --> 00:07:45.215
on a quantum physics level, on a vibrational level,

188
00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:47.685
to magnetize that experience again and again.

189
00:07:47.685 --> 00:07:48.857
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

190
00:07:48.857 --> 00:07:50.149
Well in the quantum field, there's all

191
00:07:50.149 --> 00:07:51.529
these possibilities.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

192
00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:53.881
And if you don't know that there's a possibliity for

193
00:07:53.881 --> 00:07:57.724
wholeness, love, happiness, and peace,

194
00:07:57.724 --> 00:07:59.489
you choose what you're familiar with.

195
00:07:59.489 --> 00:08:03.842
And it was striking to me that,

196
00:08:03.842 --> 00:08:06.246
that there was a whole nother world

197
00:08:06.246 --> 00:08:10.251
of love and possibility and joy and creativity

198
00:08:10.251 --> 00:08:13.006
that would, you know, spark up,

199
00:08:13.006 --> 00:08:15.882
or peek its head out at certain times.

200
00:08:15.882 --> 00:08:19.284
And it was so scary to be that visible,

201
00:08:19.284 --> 00:08:21.687
because visibility for me was about pain,

202
00:08:21.687 --> 00:08:25.890
to be that visible meant oh no, I'd better

203
00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.096
go back over here or self-sabotage.

204
00:08:28.096 --> 00:08:30.704
I mean, if I told you all the wonderful

205
00:08:30.704 --> 00:08:32.698
opportunities that were offered to me

206
00:08:32.698 --> 00:08:34.567
as a young woman, because I really,

207
00:08:34.567 --> 00:08:36.877
I have a personality and an energetic field

208
00:08:36.877 --> 00:08:40.372
that attracts, but it was so scary

209
00:08:40.372 --> 00:08:41.939
that I would run the other way.

210
00:08:41.939 --> 00:08:43.678
And it want on for years.

211
00:08:44.328 --> 00:08:45.690
<v Regina>Yes. Where you could've been</v>

212
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:47.451
kind of jumping on your path earlier.

213
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:48.937
But again, everything in its divine time.

214
00:08:48.937 --> 00:08:49.610
<v ->Absolutely, absolutely.</v>

215
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:54.057
<v Regina>So, where did you start getting the glimpses</v>

216
00:08:54.057 --> 00:08:58.225
of that field that you call more unconditional

217
00:08:58.225 --> 00:09:00.999
and love-filled or joy-filled, that didn't have

218
00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:02.567
the pain associated with it?

219
00:09:02.567 --> 00:09:04.935
Where were your first glimpses of that?

220
00:09:05.815 --> 00:09:10.079
<v ->You know, I, it was out of pain.</v>

221
00:09:10.089 --> 00:09:12.306
I was, a relationship was ending and there

222
00:09:12.306 --> 00:09:15.940
was a woman who actually was in a relationship

223
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.680
with someone that I knew.

224
00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.677
And she really had a psychic energy, but I didn't

225
00:09:20.677 --> 00:09:22.755
really totally understand that at this time.

226
00:09:22.755 --> 00:09:26.879
And she said to me, "You are at a crossroads.

227
00:09:27.619 --> 00:09:31.281
And if you choose the light,

228
00:09:31.281 --> 00:09:34.465
you have no idea what your life will be."

229
00:09:34.465 --> 00:09:35.630
<v Regina>I'm getting chills again.</v>

230
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:36.327
<v ->I know.</v>

231
00:09:36.327 --> 00:09:37.835
It was striking.

232
00:09:37.835 --> 00:09:41.525
And, um, I was singing in a choir

233
00:09:42.025 --> 00:09:44.477
and I was going on and on with this woman about

234
00:09:44.477 --> 00:09:48.076
my life and what was working and how this man left me

235
00:09:48.076 --> 00:09:49.179
and she was tired of me.

236
00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:50.050
And she said, "Read this."

237
00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.282
And she handed me a book,

238
00:09:51.282 --> 00:09:53.089
and it was "The Game of Life and How to Play It"

239
00:09:53.089 --> 00:09:56.482
by Florence Scovel Shinn, who was a transcendentalist

240
00:09:56.482 --> 00:09:58.723
and wrote this book in the early 1900s.

241
00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:01.184
And I'm reading this book and I'm thinking,

242
00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:03.494
you know I've thought about this stuff.

243
00:10:03.494 --> 00:10:06.594
And at the same time, this woman who was a psychic

244
00:10:06.594 --> 00:10:09.868
said, "You know, there's this spiritual community

245
00:10:09.868 --> 00:10:12.826
in Los Angeles,

246
00:10:12.826 --> 00:10:15.576
and it's called Guidance Church."

247
00:10:15.576 --> 00:10:17.841
And Dr. Dan Morgan is the minister and you might

248
00:10:17.841 --> 00:10:19.478
want to go there."

249
00:10:19.478 --> 00:10:21.475
And I, you know, I don't know how I dragged

250
00:10:21.475 --> 00:10:23.274
myself there, but I did.

251
00:10:23.274 --> 00:10:27.013
And when I walked in, he's standing on this platform,

252
00:10:27.013 --> 00:10:28.640
he's speaking without notes, and he's

253
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.200
talking about transformation.

254
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.004
And he's talking about living a life

255
00:10:33.004 --> 00:10:34.977
that you can be responsible for

256
00:10:34.977 --> 00:10:37.798
your choices and change your thinking.

257
00:10:37.798 --> 00:10:40.887
That man, his whole community was all

258
00:10:40.887 --> 00:10:42.802
these incredible teachers, one of which was

259
00:10:42.802 --> 00:10:44.463
Michael Bernard Beckwith.

260
00:10:44.463 --> 00:10:45.101
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

261
00:10:45.101 --> 00:10:48.932
<v ->And I went, oh.</v>

262
00:10:48.932 --> 00:10:51.405
There's something here for me and so I dived in

263
00:10:51.405 --> 00:10:55.004
and I would show up to classes in my baseball hat

264
00:10:55.004 --> 00:10:58.383
and no make-up, I mean, because I was in so much pain,

265
00:10:58.383 --> 00:10:59.846
but there was something there.

266
00:10:59.846 --> 00:11:03.189
A glimmer that said, "You're more than this.

267
00:11:03.189 --> 00:11:05.651
You're more than this pain and this old way of being.

268
00:11:05.651 --> 00:11:08.449
And what if you could choose another way?"

269
00:11:09.339 --> 00:11:10.898
<v Regina>And that's the, that's the interesting</v>

270
00:11:10.898 --> 00:11:14.393
part right there, is what if you could choose differently,

271
00:11:14.393 --> 00:11:17.087
because then again, all those subconscious programs of

272
00:11:17.087 --> 00:11:20.597
lack of self-worth would tend to jump up at that point

273
00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:23.350
and say, "You think you can choose that?"

274
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.887
<v ->Right.</v>

275
00:11:23.887 --> 00:11:25.908
<v Regina>And so, how did that work for you?</v>

276
00:11:27.158 --> 00:11:29.636
<v ->You know, it was an evolution, but I really</v>

277
00:11:29.636 --> 00:11:32.653
became to believe and still do, that freedom's a choice.

278
00:11:33.153 --> 00:11:33.823
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

279
00:11:33.823 --> 00:11:36.630
<v ->And so, when I started</v>

280
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.890
looking at my life,

281
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.260
I mean I stumbled at first and I want anybody

282
00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.291
to know who's listening to this, you know, you don't

283
00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:44.824
just leap to enlightenment.

284
00:11:44.824 --> 00:11:48.202
But I started understanding that I could say no to things

285
00:11:48.202 --> 00:11:49.932
that didn't support me.

286
00:11:49.932 --> 00:11:52.669
That I was highly intuitive and that my body was

287
00:11:52.669 --> 00:11:53.737
highly intuitive.

288
00:11:53.737 --> 00:11:55.606
And so when something was not right,

289
00:11:55.606 --> 00:11:59.542
my body would respond and I could learn to listen to it.

290
00:11:59.542 --> 00:12:01.678
And learn to take care of myself.

291
00:12:01.678 --> 00:12:03.884
And it was, it was a wonderful thing because

292
00:12:03.884 --> 00:12:06.690
I started getting that, oh

293
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.910
I am really a co-creator with Spirit.

294
00:12:11.256 --> 00:12:14.995
And if the Universe is always pouring out its abundance

295
00:12:14.995 --> 00:12:18.965
and its fullness, I'm a part of that, and so I can

296
00:12:18.965 --> 00:12:20.428
choose it for me.

297
00:12:20.428 --> 00:12:23.098
And I can also choose to say no

298
00:12:23.098 --> 00:12:25.699
for stuff that is not right for my health and

299
00:12:25.699 --> 00:12:27.214
my well-being.

300
00:12:27.568 --> 00:12:32.007
<v Regina>And this, uh, listening to the body is actually</v>

301
00:12:32.177 --> 00:12:35.742
much closer indicator of what's going on

302
00:12:35.742 --> 00:12:38.586
in terms of actually allowing youself to listen to your

303
00:12:38.586 --> 00:12:40.981
true self and the soul portion, spirit portion,

304
00:12:40.981 --> 00:12:42.150
whatever you want to call it.

305
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.554
It can speak to us more clearly through the body

306
00:12:44.554 --> 00:12:45.958
initially, than any thing else.

307
00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.652
Certainly more reliably than through the mind or the

308
00:12:48.652 --> 00:12:49.523
emotions.

309
00:12:49.523 --> 00:12:52.457
Did you work, continue working with how it was

310
00:12:52.457 --> 00:12:54.619
feeling in your body and what was the process

311
00:12:54.619 --> 00:12:56.152
from there, because I want to get into the thing

312
00:12:56.152 --> 00:12:58.738
that you talk about, which is, the vortices

313
00:12:58.738 --> 00:12:59.968
inside the body.

314
00:12:59.968 --> 00:13:00.955
I mean, we're in Sedona.

315
00:13:00.955 --> 00:13:02.464
There are vortices all around us.

316
00:13:02.464 --> 00:13:05.007
But you talk about having to clear the vortices

317
00:13:05.007 --> 00:13:06.675
within the physical body

318
00:13:06.675 --> 00:13:07.245
<v ->Right.</v>

319
00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:09.801
<v Regina>in order to start moving the healing along.</v>

320
00:13:09.801 --> 00:13:11.508
So that's a long-winded question,

321
00:13:11.508 --> 00:13:14.550
but kind of going back to this, this connection

322
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.152
between your spirit and your body and

323
00:13:16.152 --> 00:13:17.383
when you started knowing what it was

324
00:13:17.383 --> 00:13:19.219
that was speaking to you.

325
00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:23.517
<v ->Yeah, um, my solar plexus was the first place.</v>

326
00:13:23.757 --> 00:13:27.158
And it, when something did not feel right,

327
00:13:27.158 --> 00:13:29.736
there would be a constriction.

328
00:13:29.736 --> 00:13:32.359
And I would ignore it sometimes and than I would

329
00:13:32.359 --> 00:13:35.668
end up in some place that was not great for me.

330
00:13:35.668 --> 00:13:37.572
And I started looking at the correlation.

331
00:13:37.572 --> 00:13:41.276
Oh, if that happens, it's really a call for me to pause.

332
00:13:41.276 --> 00:13:43.517
It's a pause for me to say, what's going on,

333
00:13:43.517 --> 00:13:45.676
what's really happening here.

334
00:13:45.676 --> 00:13:48.555
And, so little by little, I started doing that.

335
00:13:48.555 --> 00:13:50.186
Now that was the good news.

336
00:13:50.186 --> 00:13:51.727
The interesting news is that

337
00:13:51.727 --> 00:13:54.456
it freaked people out that were in a relationship with me

338
00:13:54.456 --> 00:13:56.290
because I changed the dance.

339
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:56.696
<v Regina>Right.</v>

340
00:13:56.696 --> 00:13:59.634
<v ->And I would go, "You know, that doesn't feel right to me."</v>

341
00:13:59.634 --> 00:14:01.666
Or if somebody would tell me something, I would go,

342
00:14:01.666 --> 00:14:04.800
"I don't know. I'm not saying you're lying, but

343
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.035
something's off here," you know.

344
00:14:07.035 --> 00:14:08.968
And it started really pushing people

345
00:14:08.968 --> 00:14:12.138
and I started getting that because I was raising

346
00:14:12.138 --> 00:14:15.145
this vibration within myself and learning to listen,

347
00:14:15.145 --> 00:14:18.082
some people would leave, which was very

348
00:14:18.082 --> 00:14:21.077
scary for me cause abandonment was a big issue.

349
00:14:21.867 --> 00:14:26.255
But I was like, well, if they leave, am I creating space

350
00:14:26.255 --> 00:14:27.985
for something else?

351
00:14:27.985 --> 00:14:31.526
And so it was this kind of interesting dance that went on.

352
00:14:31.526 --> 00:14:34.591
But the more that I listened, I could literally

353
00:14:34.591 --> 00:14:37.064
feel the exhale in my body.

354
00:14:37.096 --> 00:14:39.963
The opening in my solar plexus and my heart.

355
00:14:39.963 --> 00:14:41.240
My throat was another place.

356
00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.909
It would constrict because I had choked my voice

357
00:14:44.909 --> 00:14:47.278
down because I was this creative child

358
00:14:47.278 --> 00:14:49.147
and when I would speak up in the home,

359
00:14:49.147 --> 00:14:50.714
it was a violent response.

360
00:14:50.714 --> 00:14:52.746
So I learned to pull it back.

361
00:14:52.946 --> 00:14:57.293
To open it up, and to let that energy feel open,

362
00:14:57.483 --> 00:15:00.722
was extraordinarily scary, and so my throat would

363
00:15:00.722 --> 00:15:03.160
constrict and my jaws would get tight.

364
00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.854
And I find with the people that I work with today,

365
00:15:05.854 --> 00:15:08.572
you can literally see the constriction happen

366
00:15:08.572 --> 00:15:10.851
when they're getting ready to open that space.

367
00:15:12.141 --> 00:15:15.386
<v Regina>Yeah. And it takes a lot of courage to act on it.</v>

368
00:15:15.386 --> 00:15:17.405
Like it's, at first you feel it, like you said, you had

369
00:15:17.405 --> 00:15:19.640
to have the courage to act on it.

370
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:23.819
At what point in this did you feel a lightening

371
00:15:23.819 --> 00:15:27.186
of your entire field in a type of, a new sense of

372
00:15:27.186 --> 00:15:30.379
personal truth move in to the point where

373
00:15:30.379 --> 00:15:32.759
you could confront your own past?

374
00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:35.734
And even your mother, and whoever was remaining

375
00:15:35.734 --> 00:15:37.856
of the women in the five generations.

376
00:15:38.816 --> 00:15:41.266
<v ->You know, it was a process.</v>

377
00:15:44.406 --> 00:15:47.127
There was a moment at one point where I was like,

378
00:15:47.127 --> 00:15:48.603
oh, I'm different.

379
00:15:48.603 --> 00:15:50.438
But it was little increments

380
00:15:50.438 --> 00:15:52.969
And I think that's important to know.

381
00:15:52.969 --> 00:15:56.498
That these little steps add up to a transformation.

382
00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:57.218
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

383
00:15:57.218 --> 00:16:01.548
<v ->And so, I started, I went to workshops, I went to classes,</v>

384
00:16:01.548 --> 00:16:06.053
I started really doing a lot of educating myself

385
00:16:06.053 --> 00:16:10.627
and taking classes about how do I work with this energy?

386
00:16:10.627 --> 00:16:13.890
When something's constricted, it is giving me

387
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:14.598
information.

388
00:16:14.598 --> 00:16:16.328
There's a language in the body.

389
00:16:16.328 --> 00:16:18.920
How do I learn that language, because the way

390
00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.474
I was brought up didn't teach me to do that?

391
00:16:21.474 --> 00:16:23.901
So how, what's it trying to tell me?

392
00:16:23.901 --> 00:16:25.677
And so that I can start listening.

393
00:16:25.677 --> 00:16:29.474
Now, when something's in the room that's not right,

394
00:16:29.474 --> 00:16:31.111
I address it immediately.

395
00:16:31.111 --> 00:16:33.746
I go, I'm not feeling right in my body.

396
00:16:33.746 --> 00:16:35.604
Let's talk about this.

397
00:16:35.604 --> 00:16:37.485
But that, I learned it along along the way and I

398
00:16:40.285 --> 00:16:43.057
it was extraordinarily scary

399
00:16:43.057 --> 00:16:45.270
because I really

400
00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.700
I wanted to be seen and loved and validated more than

401
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.766
anything because that wasn't the experience as

402
00:16:50.766 --> 00:16:51.672
a child.

403
00:16:51.672 --> 00:16:56.103
And so, to really open that space and say,

404
00:16:56.743 --> 00:17:00.806
"Even if you don't like this, even if you can't accept

405
00:17:00.806 --> 00:17:04.847
me in this moment, I have to trust this, because

406
00:17:04.847 --> 00:17:08.887
I've learned the language of my body and I trust it."

407
00:17:11.757 --> 00:17:15.296
<v Regina>How about with your step-father?</v>

408
00:17:15.296 --> 00:17:17.594
Sexual abuse is big.

409
00:17:17.594 --> 00:17:20.926
The women can, you can go back and you can redress it

410
00:17:20.926 --> 00:17:23.365
and say, I didn't feel safe in my own home.

411
00:17:23.365 --> 00:17:26.412
And deal with the women and go through what has to

412
00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:27.936
happen between the two of you.

413
00:17:28.656 --> 00:17:30.339
But what about the other end of it, where you're

414
00:17:30.339 --> 00:17:33.508
talking about the man and the sexual abuse?

415
00:17:33.508 --> 00:17:36.504
How in your being, what did it take to move through that

416
00:17:36.504 --> 00:17:38.141
and let that part go?

417
00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:41.252
And again, I've not been through that, so I don't

418
00:17:41.252 --> 00:17:43.713
understand the dynamic when you're so young

419
00:17:43.713 --> 00:17:45.083
that this seems almost normal.

420
00:17:45.083 --> 00:17:46.616
And I've interviewed a couple people,

421
00:17:46.616 --> 00:17:48.008
Cathy O'Brien and a couple others,

422
00:17:48.008 --> 00:17:49.947
who became normal for them.

423
00:17:49.947 --> 00:17:53.396
So it's hard for people, like me, to really understand.

424
00:17:53.396 --> 00:17:56.659
How would that kind of betrayal, how would you

425
00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:58.133
work with that kind and let it go?

426
00:17:58.413 --> 00:18:00.060
How did it work there?

427
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.870
<v ->Well, you kind of get cut in half.</v>

428
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:04.704
You know, we are sexual beings.

429
00:18:04.704 --> 00:18:07.607
We come in with those natural instincts.

430
00:18:07.607 --> 00:18:09.813
And so a part of you is having the experience

431
00:18:09.813 --> 00:18:11.810
of what is a natural instinct, even though

432
00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.317
there's something going, "this is not right."

433
00:18:14.317 --> 00:18:14.817
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

434
00:18:16.017 --> 00:18:19.054
<v ->And then when you find out, whoa this really wasn't</v>

435
00:18:19.054 --> 00:18:22.507
right, then you start questioning, who are you.

436
00:18:23.667 --> 00:18:27.100
I remember several times, I would have these

437
00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.438
wonderful connections with people,

438
00:18:29.658 --> 00:18:33.322
and as long as the sex didn't mean anything,

439
00:18:33.322 --> 00:18:35.502
it was great.

440
00:18:35.502 --> 00:18:39.679
But if they wanted to move to a place of intimacy,

441
00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:42.381
the thought was, "oh no.

442
00:18:42.381 --> 00:18:44.709
You can not trust that. You're not safe."

443
00:18:44.709 --> 00:18:46.209
It would shut down.

444
00:18:46.209 --> 00:18:49.016
And so I went thorough a lot of energy work

445
00:18:49.016 --> 00:18:53.184
in opening that part of my body and really,

446
00:18:53.184 --> 00:18:57.488
first of all grieving at the death of my innocence.

447
00:18:57.488 --> 00:19:01.958
And the beauty of a child, you know, just being able to play

448
00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:06.030
and allowing that sexuality to grow into itself.

449
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:06.634
Um.

450
00:19:06.634 --> 00:19:07.806
Isn't it funny, I feel emotional.

451
00:19:07.806 --> 00:19:08.770
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

452
00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:10.500
<v ->Um.</v>

453
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.311
<v Regina>You didn't get that opportunity.</v>

454
00:19:12.311 --> 00:19:13.727
<v ->Yeah.</v>

455
00:19:13.727 --> 00:19:17.977
And so I had to do a lot of forgiveness work,

456
00:19:17.977 --> 00:19:21.478
a lot of energy clearing work, and I had to

457
00:19:23.158 --> 00:19:25.188
really move into a place of,

458
00:19:25.188 --> 00:19:27.456
that I deserved to be loved.

459
00:19:28.116 --> 00:19:31.426
And I deserve to share it, mentally, emotionally,

460
00:19:31.426 --> 00:19:32.692
physically, sexually.

461
00:19:33.292 --> 00:19:35.922
And when I,

462
00:19:35.922 --> 00:19:38.392
before I met my husband,

463
00:19:38.392 --> 00:19:39.663
you know I'd been through a lot of

464
00:19:39.663 --> 00:19:41.733
relationships and marriages and I,

465
00:19:41.733 --> 00:19:43.860
I went on hiatus from all of that and said,

466
00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.240
I've got to do my own healing work.

467
00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:50.014
And so, my husband is

468
00:19:50.014 --> 00:19:52.854
an outpicturing of the shift in my consciousness

469
00:19:52.854 --> 00:19:54.751
and my ability to trust.

470
00:19:54.751 --> 00:19:57.850
Trust God, Source, and me.

471
00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:00.045
And therefore, I could let him in.

472
00:20:01.355 --> 00:20:03.188
<v Regina>Well, that's wonderful that the trust was</v>

473
00:20:03.188 --> 00:20:04.790
inherent to the relationship.

474
00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:05.893
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

475
00:20:05.893 --> 00:20:08.296
<v Regina>Were you able to ultimately forgive</v>

476
00:20:08.296 --> 00:20:11.570
and remove the blocked vortices in your body

477
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.856
from your experience as a child with you step-dad?

478
00:20:14.856 --> 00:20:16.574
<v ->Yeah, you know I did a, I used to be an actress,</v>

479
00:20:16.574 --> 00:20:19.303
and I did a one-woman show called "The Hand of God."

480
00:20:19.303 --> 00:20:23.145
And it was all about this journey and, you know,

481
00:20:23.145 --> 00:20:25.584
I found out through my own conversations

482
00:20:25.584 --> 00:20:27.337
with my mother that he had been abused

483
00:20:27.337 --> 00:20:28.661
and come from really

484
00:20:28.661 --> 00:20:29.334
<v Regina>Sure.</v>
<v ->dysfunction</v>

485
00:20:29.334 --> 00:20:30.659
<v Regina>usually that's the case.</v>

486
00:20:30.659 --> 00:20:31.849
<v ->Exactly.</v>

487
00:20:31.849 --> 00:20:34.427
And um, and so,

488
00:20:35.137 --> 00:20:38.727
I did this process where

489
00:20:39.857 --> 00:20:43.660
actually it was a woman, I was on a massage table,

490
00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.702
and she was a person that did really deep energy work

491
00:20:46.702 --> 00:20:47.898
with people.

492
00:20:47.898 --> 00:20:50.673
And while she's working on me, she said,

493
00:20:50.673 --> 00:20:54.030
"Someone has come into the room that wants to talk to you."

494
00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.291
And immediately I saw him.

495
00:20:55.314 --> 00:20:56.957
I saw he was in a suit and he had a hat.

496
00:20:56.957 --> 00:20:58.630
And she said, "He's in a suit with a hat."

497
00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:00.077
And I go, yeah.

498
00:21:00.077 --> 00:21:01.135
And I said, it's my step-father.

499
00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:02.214
And she said, 'Do you want to talk to him?"

500
00:21:02.214 --> 00:21:04.334
And I said, okay.

501
00:21:04.334 --> 00:21:07.060
So he said, he'd passed on to the other side.

502
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:10.684
He said, "So I'm here because I want to apologize

503
00:21:10.684 --> 00:21:11.913
for what I did to you."

504
00:21:11.913 --> 00:21:15.130
And he said, "I want you to know that it is

505
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.533
important that you let me go.

506
00:21:17.533 --> 00:21:19.100
That you are holding on to me

507
00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.134
with your consciousness.

508
00:21:20.134 --> 00:21:22.235
You're linked in to me and I'm asking that

509
00:21:22.235 --> 00:21:24.975
you give permissions for the angels to cut the cord

510
00:21:24.975 --> 00:21:27.125
with golden scissors."

511
00:21:27.645 --> 00:21:30.977
And, you know at first, I was like, please.

512
00:21:30.977 --> 00:21:33.009
You are not in Heaven and there's no angels.

513
00:21:33.009 --> 00:21:34.209
You know, I mean I was in that place.

514
00:21:34.209 --> 00:21:34.913
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

515
00:21:34.913 --> 00:21:37.549
<v ->But then it was, oh this is really about</v>

516
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:39.917
forgiveness and letting go.

517
00:21:39.917 --> 00:21:42.796
So that he can be free and I can be free.

518
00:21:42.796 --> 00:21:43.992
<v Regina>Yes. Break the resonance.</v>

519
00:21:43.992 --> 00:21:44.758
<v ->Exactly.</v>

520
00:21:44.758 --> 00:21:46.999
And so it was, it was huge.

521
00:21:46.999 --> 00:21:49.435
Um, that became the end of my play.

522
00:21:49.435 --> 00:21:52.186
And so that I could say to people, you know,

523
00:21:53.076 --> 00:21:56.087
this, you can drag this energy,

524
00:21:56.087 --> 00:21:58.047
this story, these people,

525
00:21:58.047 --> 00:22:01.741
as long as you want, but when you cut that cord,

526
00:22:01.741 --> 00:22:04.284
there's an inherent freedom in it.

527
00:22:04.284 --> 00:22:06.284
<v Regina>Absolutely. That's beautiful and thank you</v>

528
00:22:06.284 --> 00:22:07.386
for sharing that with us.

529
00:22:07.386 --> 00:22:09.616
I know that's tender.

530
00:22:09.616 --> 00:22:12.251
Going back to the incarnation patterns,

531
00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:15.316
going back into the large picture, you chose this family

532
00:22:15.316 --> 00:22:18.892
to incarnate into, you chose this for your own healing.

533
00:22:18.892 --> 00:22:21.702
And so that you can help so many others go through

534
00:22:21.702 --> 00:22:22.770
the same process.

535
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:25.311
So now let's take that and go into,

536
00:22:26.001 --> 00:22:29.551
in this process of embodying these bodies

537
00:22:29.551 --> 00:22:33.330
in our DNA and all of this that gets coded in the mix.

538
00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.912
This shows up as you talked about earlier

539
00:22:35.912 --> 00:22:37.880
within the vortices within the body.

540
00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.480
Let's talk about anybody out there who's listening

541
00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.081
and resonating and the world and the energies,

542
00:22:43.081 --> 00:22:45.887
the prevailing energies are pushing them to the max.

543
00:22:45.887 --> 00:22:48.221
And now the programs are running.

544
00:22:48.221 --> 00:22:50.728
And something has to be done, where do you begin?

545
00:22:52.458 --> 00:22:55.387
<v ->You know, um, I'm talking about this at the conference.</v>

546
00:22:55.387 --> 00:22:58.670
I think that there has to be a soul remembrance

547
00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.003
of why you are really here.

548
00:23:02.893 --> 00:23:05.670
Because we are here, really, to support the

549
00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:08.004
change and the shift on this planet.

550
00:23:08.004 --> 00:23:10.941
And so when you get clear about that, then

551
00:23:10.941 --> 00:23:12.685
you get to say, okay,

552
00:23:12.685 --> 00:23:15.815
is this story that I've been telling,

553
00:23:15.815 --> 00:23:20.109
running, whatever it is, is it defining me?

554
00:23:20.659 --> 00:23:23.146
Because if it's defining you based on

555
00:23:23.146 --> 00:23:25.024
where you've been, what's happened, whatever

556
00:23:25.024 --> 00:23:26.859
the experience, whatever that is.

557
00:23:26.859 --> 00:23:30.400
If that's the case, you can not step into your destiny.

558
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.095
You can not step into your purpose

559
00:23:32.095 --> 00:23:34.173
because you're cycling in that place

560
00:23:34.173 --> 00:23:38.689
And so it takes a willingness to let go of that story.

561
00:23:39.409 --> 00:23:42.579
And to start clearing out the energetic fields,

562
00:23:42.579 --> 00:23:46.178
the chakras, the belief systems.

563
00:23:46.178 --> 00:23:49.317
And sometimes that's classes,

564
00:23:49.317 --> 00:23:52.068
sometimes that's meditation,

565
00:23:52.068 --> 00:23:53.822
a spiritual practice is essential.

566
00:23:53.822 --> 00:23:56.330
I mean, I really feel that for everyone who's

567
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:58.717
going through stuff on this planet,

568
00:23:58.717 --> 00:24:00.800
expand the container.

569
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.399
And that means, upleveling your spiritual practice.

570
00:24:05.179 --> 00:24:08.172
Meditating more, praying more, yoga more,

571
00:24:08.172 --> 00:24:08.973
work the body.

572
00:24:08.973 --> 00:24:11.237
I mean, all of that stuff, because until you can

573
00:24:11.237 --> 00:24:13.745
expand that container, you can not hold

574
00:24:13.745 --> 00:24:17.147
the energy that is cycling and moving on this planet.

575
00:24:18.107 --> 00:24:19.143
<v Regina>That makes sense.</v>

576
00:24:19.143 --> 00:24:22.294
So where, so let's say we,

577
00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:23.614
let's say someone watching

578
00:24:23.614 --> 00:24:26.109
that is relating to this, already has their practice.

579
00:24:26.109 --> 00:24:29.022
But maybe has not identified what the direct

580
00:24:29.022 --> 00:24:31.854
experience of their true self feels like.

581
00:24:31.854 --> 00:24:33.491
Because this can be very subtle and often not

582
00:24:33.491 --> 00:24:35.628
recognized, in most cases, in most humans.

583
00:24:35.628 --> 00:24:37.636
It's never recognized overtly.

584
00:24:38.416 --> 00:24:41.822
So let's talk about how you begin fostering and

585
00:24:41.822 --> 00:24:44.567
recognizing that connection, which then allows for

586
00:24:44.567 --> 00:24:46.971
the message of the true, true purpose

587
00:24:46.971 --> 00:24:48.248
on the planet.

588
00:24:51.008 --> 00:24:52.607
<v ->Well,</v>

589
00:24:53.147 --> 00:24:55.678
we're actually made up of light.

590
00:24:56.468 --> 00:24:59.965
And so if you were in this moment, just to sit

591
00:24:59.965 --> 00:25:01.588
right where you were and close your eyes

592
00:25:01.588 --> 00:25:04.188
and start to breathe light into your heart

593
00:25:04.188 --> 00:25:07.996
and exhale love into this space.

594
00:25:07.996 --> 00:25:10.365
And you do that over a period of time, all of

595
00:25:10.365 --> 00:25:12.896
a sudden you start to experience that the love

596
00:25:12.896 --> 00:25:15.171
and the light are the same thing.

597
00:25:15.171 --> 00:25:18.741
And that that energy is not just coming from the

598
00:25:18.741 --> 00:25:21.506
inside out, but it's coming from the outside in

599
00:25:21.506 --> 00:25:22.516
and it's cycling.

600
00:25:22.516 --> 00:25:26.498
And you start to realize that that is who you are.

601
00:25:26.498 --> 00:25:30.190
The body holds it, experiences of your life

602
00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:32.884
are the experiences, but you are that essence.

603
00:25:32.884 --> 00:25:34.857
And there is something amazing.

604
00:25:34.857 --> 00:25:38.275
In all meditation practices, they talk about you know, the,

605
00:25:38.275 --> 00:25:41.735
you know, the breath, but it's a really powerful tool.

606
00:25:41.735 --> 00:25:43.592
Because when you start breathing in light

607
00:25:43.592 --> 00:25:45.729
into the heart, because the heart is contextual,

608
00:25:45.729 --> 00:25:49.432
when you start doing that, all of a sudden,

609
00:25:49.432 --> 00:25:53.310
there is this exhale and energetically it will drop you

610
00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:55.377
into this field of peace and love which is

611
00:25:55.377 --> 00:25:56.839
everywhere present.

612
00:25:56.839 --> 00:25:59.278
And in there, you discover who you are.

613
00:25:59.278 --> 00:26:02.910
And in there, you can heal all ways of being.

614
00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:05.350
<v Regina>So let's say we've gone that far.</v>

615
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.918
<v ->Okay.</v>

616
00:26:06.448 --> 00:26:09.657
<v Regina>And now, just because it's happened,</v>

617
00:26:09.657 --> 00:26:12.188
you've found this and you know you can do that, and even

618
00:26:12.188 --> 00:26:13.697
you know why you're here.

619
00:26:13.697 --> 00:26:15.996
You still have the subconscious programs and

620
00:26:15.996 --> 00:26:17.319
something's been triggered.

621
00:26:17.319 --> 00:26:18.991
Someone has treated you in a way that is

622
00:26:18.991 --> 00:26:20.094
your hotspot.

623
00:26:20.094 --> 00:26:22.776
And you find all this work, you feel like a failure

624
00:26:22.776 --> 00:26:25.539
because you're falling right back into the fear, anger,

625
00:26:25.539 --> 00:26:27.200
whatever it is you fall into.

626
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.837
Resentment, jealousy.

627
00:26:28.837 --> 00:26:30.311
Whatever the buzz is.

628
00:26:30.311 --> 00:26:32.215
And now, where do you start working

629
00:26:32.215 --> 00:26:35.319
with the vortices and such after that?

630
00:26:35.919 --> 00:26:36.511
<v ->Okay.</v>

631
00:26:36.511 --> 00:26:39.158
The tendency is to run from it.

632
00:26:39.158 --> 00:26:41.689
You gotta go into it.

633
00:26:41.689 --> 00:26:45.961
The tendency is to withdraw and try to pray it away,

634
00:26:45.961 --> 00:26:48.632
think it away, write it away, sex it away.

635
00:26:48.632 --> 00:26:49.804
<v Regina>Not feel it.</v>
<v ->Exactly.</v>

636
00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:52.103
But here's the thing.

637
00:26:52.103 --> 00:26:56.372
We are really called to go into it because

638
00:26:56.372 --> 00:27:00.505
at the core of it is the peace and the harmony.

639
00:27:00.505 --> 00:27:03.674
Now, what that doesn't mean is allowing the

640
00:27:03.674 --> 00:27:06.078
emotions to take us off and go into

641
00:27:06.078 --> 00:27:07.285
<v Regina>Do their trip.</v>

642
00:27:07.285 --> 00:27:08.249
<v ->Exactly.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

643
00:27:08.249 --> 00:27:10.815
<v ->It really means to go deep into that feeling, and</v>

644
00:27:10.815 --> 00:27:15.378
if you, let's say that that you feel betrayed.

645
00:27:15.818 --> 00:27:18.187
If you really close your eyes and say,

646
00:27:18.187 --> 00:27:21.531
where does that betrayal live in my body,

647
00:27:21.531 --> 00:27:22.459
it will tell you.

648
00:27:22.459 --> 00:27:25.466
A lot of times, it's throat or heart or solar plexus.

649
00:27:25.466 --> 00:27:26.997
But, um,

650
00:27:27.657 --> 00:27:30.997
and then you allow yourself to just

651
00:27:30.997 --> 00:27:35.045
start energetically going into that space in the body.

652
00:27:35.045 --> 00:27:38.551
If you keep doing that, using light, it will

653
00:27:38.551 --> 00:27:41.244
start to break apart that energy and it will drop you

654
00:27:41.244 --> 00:27:43.148
into the field of peace and love.

655
00:27:43.148 --> 00:27:45.691
And in there, it will take you back to

656
00:27:45.691 --> 00:27:48.454
the place that is wanting to be healed and transformed.

657
00:27:49.954 --> 00:27:52.065
<v Regina>And do you use breath at that point?</v>

658
00:27:52.065 --> 00:27:53.493
Do you continue breathing through?

659
00:27:53.493 --> 00:27:57.618
Stay calm and still and go into it and just keep breathing?

660
00:27:57.858 --> 00:27:58.636
<v ->You can.</v>

661
00:27:58.636 --> 00:28:00.169
But the use of light.

662
00:28:02.169 --> 00:28:03.733
I tell people to imagine that there's a

663
00:28:03.733 --> 00:28:06.058
laser beam of light that's filled with love and truth

664
00:28:06.058 --> 00:28:08.504
and love and truth and there's nothing more powerful.

665
00:28:08.504 --> 00:28:10.307
And you use that to dive thorugh.

666
00:28:10.307 --> 00:28:14.723
Let's say that your throat feels like it's constricted.

667
00:28:15.613 --> 00:28:17.610
And it's dense energy.

668
00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:19.189
That if you find the center of that energy

669
00:28:19.189 --> 00:28:22.001
and you allow that light laser beam to keep

670
00:28:22.001 --> 00:28:24.588
cutting through it and be patient.

671
00:28:24.588 --> 00:28:26.164
Cause some people can go right through it.

672
00:28:26.164 --> 00:28:27.463
Some people it takes longer cause

673
00:28:27.463 --> 00:28:28.822
it's been there a long time.

674
00:28:28.822 --> 00:28:30.459
But if you let that go right in there,

675
00:28:30.459 --> 00:28:33.664
over a little bit of time, it will break it down

676
00:28:33.664 --> 00:28:35.638
until you drop into that place.

677
00:28:35.638 --> 00:28:38.134
And then you start to get, oh.

678
00:28:38.134 --> 00:28:40.444
There's something in here that wants to be healed.

679
00:28:40.444 --> 00:28:42.209
And it will take you there.

680
00:28:44.539 --> 00:28:48.281
<v Regina>So, as we discover it, it speaks to us</v>

681
00:28:48.281 --> 00:28:49.848
through the body.

682
00:28:49.848 --> 00:28:53.621
And what happens at that point when it speaks to us?

683
00:28:53.621 --> 00:28:55.943
When it speaks to us, it shows us what it is.

684
00:28:55.943 --> 00:28:58.590
And perhaps you even have an opportunity

685
00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:01.316
to look at what has fed into it, via past events

686
00:29:01.316 --> 00:29:02.929
and so forth.

687
00:29:02.929 --> 00:29:04.996
And then you have to have the willingness to not let

688
00:29:04.996 --> 00:29:06.401
it be your story any more because maybe

689
00:29:06.401 --> 00:29:08.375
there's been a benefit in that, right?

690
00:29:08.375 --> 00:29:09.141
<v ->Right.</v>

691
00:29:09.141 --> 00:29:12.473
<v Regina>Lot of sympathy, you know, and so forth.</v>

692
00:29:12.473 --> 00:29:14.005
So what comes then?

693
00:29:14.005 --> 00:29:15.341
<v ->Forgiveness.
<v Regina>In the final.</v>

694
00:29:15.341 --> 00:29:19.509
Forgiveness of yourself first or others?

695
00:29:19.509 --> 00:29:22.086
<v ->Well you know, it's really, really</v>

696
00:29:22.086 --> 00:29:24.756
where spirit is concerned, there's nothing to forgive.

697
00:29:24.756 --> 00:29:26.031
Everything is just energy and information.

698
00:29:26.031 --> 00:29:26.521
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

699
00:29:27.461 --> 00:29:29.992
But for us, it's the perceptions and the judgements that

700
00:29:29.992 --> 00:29:31.490
come with it.

701
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:33.916
So the forgiveness is really about,

702
00:29:33.916 --> 00:29:35.386
how have I perceived it?

703
00:29:35.386 --> 00:29:37.918
What have I judged of myself and others?

704
00:29:37.918 --> 00:29:39.701
And a lot of times, it's the same thing.

705
00:29:39.701 --> 00:29:41.164
I mean, I judge you for betraying me,

706
00:29:41.164 --> 00:29:43.242
but how many times have I betrayed myself?

707
00:29:43.242 --> 00:29:45.169
I judge you for abusing me, but how many times

708
00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:46.412
have I abused myself?

709
00:29:46.412 --> 00:29:50.579
So it's really a process, a dual process of forgiving

710
00:29:50.579 --> 00:29:52.715
the judgements of others and yourself.

711
00:29:52.715 --> 00:29:55.942
And then, and then choosing.

712
00:29:55.942 --> 00:29:57.289
Because I know people who go through these

713
00:29:57.289 --> 00:29:59.449
forgiveness processes all the time.

714
00:29:59.449 --> 00:30:00.888
But then they don't choose differently

715
00:30:00.888 --> 00:30:02.177
and they're right back in it.

716
00:30:02.177 --> 00:30:02.688
<v Regina>Right.</v>

717
00:30:02.688 --> 00:30:04.125
<v ->So it, it works in tandem.</v>

718
00:30:04.125 --> 00:30:05.855
<v Regina>Because maybe the benefits are still</v>

719
00:30:05.855 --> 00:30:07.068
<v ->Exactly.
<v Regina>there for them.</v>

720
00:30:07.068 --> 00:30:09.663
So we have to really, this you said earlier,

721
00:30:09.663 --> 00:30:13.436
we have to be willing to let go of the story.

722
00:30:13.436 --> 00:30:14.934
As our identity.

723
00:30:14.934 --> 00:30:17.743
And people's stories are their identity oftentimes, right?

724
00:30:17.801 --> 00:30:19.578
<v ->Well yes, but you know that's why I started with</v>

725
00:30:19.578 --> 00:30:22.097
this remembering who you are.

726
00:30:22.097 --> 00:30:24.674
If I really am a being of light.

727
00:30:24.674 --> 00:30:27.577
If I really am here to bring my gifts.

728
00:30:27.577 --> 00:30:29.041
If I'm a divine idea,

729
00:30:30.221 --> 00:30:33.760
then I'm unique and I'm magnificent.

730
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:37.387
So that means, then, that this identity with this

731
00:30:37.387 --> 00:30:39.930
other stuff is slowing down what I came

732
00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:41.416
here to do.

733
00:30:41.416 --> 00:30:44.597
And, I have to be willing to go through the discomfort

734
00:30:44.597 --> 00:30:47.070
of letting it go so that I can allow this other thing

735
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:48.301
to blossom.

736
00:30:48.301 --> 00:30:49.566
<v Regina>Because the people around you</v>

737
00:30:49.566 --> 00:30:51.830
oftentimes relate to that story.

738
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:53.293
That's their connection to you.

739
00:30:53.293 --> 00:30:54.942
<v ->Yeah, your tribe.</v>

740
00:30:54.942 --> 00:30:57.949
You can crate a whole tribe around it.

741
00:30:57.949 --> 00:31:00.143
You know, I mean, I can not tell you

742
00:31:00.143 --> 00:31:02.140
how many victims I had in my life

743
00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.288
and we just loved to call each other.

744
00:31:05.268 --> 00:31:06.888
<v Regina>So you have to be willing to let go of</v>

745
00:31:06.888 --> 00:31:09.686
what had been close relationships and such.

746
00:31:09.686 --> 00:31:12.461
I mean, there is an effect that has to be addressed

747
00:31:12.461 --> 00:31:14.330
as you move on and lighten your field,

748
00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:15.596
refine yourself.

749
00:31:15.596 --> 00:31:18.463
But let's look at the other side of it then.

750
00:31:18.463 --> 00:31:20.600
As you do that, and you've gone through this

751
00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.432
process, I just, I call it a process, of refinement

752
00:31:23.432 --> 00:31:24.744
of the being.

753
00:31:24.744 --> 00:31:28.645
And you're now on the other side of that or

754
00:31:28.645 --> 00:31:32.709
well into it, what starts happening by way of resonance?

755
00:31:32.709 --> 00:31:34.741
I mean, obviously your husband is one of them, but

756
00:31:34.741 --> 00:31:37.039
what happens then
<v ->You're one of them.</v>

757
00:31:37.039 --> 00:31:37.887
<v Regina>to your world?</v>

758
00:31:37.887 --> 00:31:39.152
Yes.

759
00:31:39.152 --> 00:31:40.685
That's right.
<v ->I'm sitting here with you</v>

760
00:31:40.685 --> 00:31:41.556
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

761
00:31:41.556 --> 00:31:42.821
We are a reflection of it.

762
00:31:42.821 --> 00:31:43.796
Yeah.

763
00:31:43.796 --> 00:31:46.188
<v Regina>And that's what starts happening to your world.</v>

764
00:31:46.188 --> 00:31:47.755
<v ->Everywhere.</v>

765
00:31:47.755 --> 00:31:48.268
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

766
00:31:48.268 --> 00:31:51.927
<v ->I mean, in stores,</v>

767
00:31:52.867 --> 00:31:57.058
in restaurants, in social gatherings, in, I mean.

768
00:31:57.568 --> 00:32:01.004
When I got the call about doing this with you,

769
00:32:01.004 --> 00:32:03.001
and started looking at who you are, I was like,

770
00:32:03.001 --> 00:32:04.069
oh wow yeah.

771
00:32:04.069 --> 00:32:05.904
I mean, there's another sister on the planet.

772
00:32:05.904 --> 00:32:06.232
You know what I mean?

773
00:32:06.232 --> 00:32:06.629
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

774
00:32:06.629 --> 00:32:08.887
We start, and Ithink that one of the things

775
00:32:08.887 --> 00:32:10.582
that's happening in this whole enrgetic

776
00:32:10.582 --> 00:32:14.251
shift is that the tribe, the Universal tribe

777
00:32:14.251 --> 00:32:17.096
is finding itself, and we are coming together

778
00:32:17.096 --> 00:32:18.571
in huge form.
<v Regina>You bet.</v>

779
00:32:18.571 --> 00:32:20.590
You bet. Little chills again.

780
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:21.391
(laughs)

781
00:32:21.391 --> 00:32:22.726
Absolutely.

782
00:32:22.726 --> 00:32:26.326
And so, when you look back on this journey,

783
00:32:26.326 --> 00:32:29.205
you've had a couple different lives in one.

784
00:32:29.205 --> 00:32:32.026
I mean, that's really the beauty of it,

785
00:32:32.026 --> 00:32:33.872
is you're kind of knocking through a few lives

786
00:32:33.872 --> 00:32:34.961
at one time.
<v ->Exactly.</v>

787
00:32:34.961 --> 00:32:37.111
<v Regina>The choice to take it on,</v>

788
00:32:37.111 --> 00:32:39.305
accelerate it, and heal it.

789
00:32:39.305 --> 00:32:41.812
And, it seems to me,

790
00:32:41.812 --> 00:32:43.762
there's not been a time in history

791
00:32:43.762 --> 00:32:45.006
more appropriate for each one of

792
00:32:45.006 --> 00:32:46.086
us to do this.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

793
00:32:46.086 --> 00:32:47.380
<v Regina>To take on and develop ourselves to the</v>

794
00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.284
extent where we can look at it like, that was

795
00:32:49.284 --> 00:32:51.525
lifetimes ago within a lifetime.

796
00:32:51.525 --> 00:32:52.988
<v ->Right.</v>

797
00:32:52.988 --> 00:32:54.021
<v Regina>So.</v>

798
00:32:54.021 --> 00:32:56.169
As we've kind of moved through this journey a bit,

799
00:32:56.169 --> 00:32:58.061
and we'll encourage people to find you.

800
00:32:58.061 --> 00:33:00.732
And you have, you have your book, you have CDs,

801
00:33:00.732 --> 00:33:03.007
all of this that people can connect in with to

802
00:33:03.007 --> 00:33:05.306
have that support and hear your voice

803
00:33:05.306 --> 00:33:07.245
as they go through their own process.

804
00:33:07.245 --> 00:33:11.146
Any final thoughts on whatever it is we need to hear

805
00:33:11.146 --> 00:33:13.160
before we sign off here?

806
00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.346
<v ->I believe you're a masterpiece.</v>

807
00:33:17.346 --> 00:33:19.215
I believe you're a masterpiece in the making

808
00:33:19.215 --> 00:33:23.417
that you are being painted, sung, written, talked.

809
00:33:23.627 --> 00:33:26.262
And answer your call.

810
00:33:26.262 --> 00:33:29.327
There is something that you came to do,

811
00:33:29.327 --> 00:33:31.069
that no one else can do.

812
00:33:31.069 --> 00:33:33.762
Do not let anything or anyone detour you.

813
00:33:33.762 --> 00:33:35.399
I do not care what it looks like.

814
00:33:35.399 --> 00:33:37.837
I don't care what's happened.

815
00:33:37.837 --> 00:33:40.380
Say yes to your life and life will say

816
00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:43.721
yes to you in a way that you can not even imagine.

817
00:33:44.141 --> 00:33:47.311
<v Regina>Well that's a, a beautiful parting gift</v>

818
00:33:47.311 --> 00:33:50.432
for each person taking that on for themselves.

819
00:33:50.432 --> 00:33:52.617
And I thank you so much for your time, Cynthia.

820
00:33:52.617 --> 00:33:54.208
<v ->Thank you.</v>

821
00:33:56.796 --> 00:33:58.526
<v ->If some of these themes have permeated your</v>

822
00:33:58.526 --> 00:34:01.731
own family experience and relationships, you can work with

823
00:34:01.731 --> 00:34:04.064
Cynthia through her books, her audio tapes, or

824
00:34:04.064 --> 00:34:07.431
reach her through her website at cynthiajames.net.

825
00:34:07.431 --> 00:34:08.569
Meanwhile, you might also enjoy our

826
00:34:08.569 --> 00:34:10.775
interview with Byron Katie, in which she

827
00:34:10.775 --> 00:34:12.539
helps us begin delving into what's true

828
00:34:12.539 --> 00:34:15.337
versus what we believe to be true.

829
00:34:15.337 --> 00:34:17.741
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

830
00:34:17.741 --> 00:34:21.708
