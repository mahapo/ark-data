00:00:00.424 --> 00:00:05.184
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.098
<v ->One of our favorite interviewees, Steven Ross, is back</v>

3
00:00:16.098 --> 00:00:19.219
with us with his new book titled, And Nothing Happened.

4
00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:22.073
In it, he tells us of the powerful healing technologies

5
00:00:22.073 --> 00:00:25.084
of the past that were bypassed or deliberately ignored

6
00:00:25.084 --> 00:00:28.125
by the medical profession, in spite of the fact that many

7
00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:30.259
of the inventors and practitioners

8
00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.995
were medical doctors themselves.

9
00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:34.551
One case was that of Dr. Kate Baldwin,

10
00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:36.465
a surgeon who was using colored lights

11
00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:40.376
to effect powerful healing in her patients.

12
00:00:46.938 --> 00:00:49.309
<v Regina>So, they say the third time's a charm,</v>

13
00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.210
but I have found every time with you charming,

14
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.289
and this is our third encounter on camera, Steven.

15
00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.882
And, as I was reading your book called But Nothing Happened,

16
00:00:58.882 --> 00:01:02.188
I was getting, I have to say, I was getting more steamed up

17
00:01:02.188 --> 00:01:04.692
by the moment and what it was, was it was resurrecting

18
00:01:04.692 --> 00:01:08.493
a lot of steamy stuff from 25 years ago,

19
00:01:08.493 --> 00:01:11.102
which is our connecting point, when we were both in Europe

20
00:01:11.102 --> 00:01:14.236
chasing the same really astounding physicists

21
00:01:14.236 --> 00:01:17.939
and medical doctors in energy healing.

22
00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.035
And so, we're going to pick up the journey

23
00:01:20.035 --> 00:01:21.979
with all those early technologies, but do you mind

24
00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.106
for a moment, while I read a bit of your disclaimer,

25
00:01:24.106 --> 00:01:25.515
because you're big on laughing.

26
00:01:25.515 --> 00:01:27.683
<v ->I'm ready to go, I'm here for you.</v>

27
00:01:27.683 --> 00:01:30.020
<v Regina>I laughed out loud when I read your disclaimer.</v>

28
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.908
I said, Scott I've gotta read this to you.

29
00:01:31.908 --> 00:01:34.159
Okay so, you say "The following disclaimer is required

30
00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.587
"due to certain vested interests that exist

31
00:01:36.587 --> 00:01:38.785
"within the health field," on and on.

32
00:01:38.785 --> 00:01:41.059
Then you do the standard disclaimer.

33
00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:43.087
Then, you write a note at the end of the disclaimer

34
00:01:43.087 --> 00:01:45.397
saying, "Apparently there is no problem for you

35
00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:46.929
"to take the pharmaceutical products

36
00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.705
"that are recommended to you through the advertising media.

37
00:01:49.705 --> 00:01:51.643
"Remember, some of their side effects are minimal,

38
00:01:51.643 --> 00:01:53.732
"that might include heart attack, stroke, coma,

39
00:01:53.732 --> 00:01:56.311
"or other minor problems, such as personality changes

40
00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:58.678
"and a desire to commit suicide.

41
00:01:58.678 --> 00:02:01.205
"Please read product labels carefully and remember

42
00:02:01.205 --> 00:02:03.547
"that you should consult the physician's desk reference

43
00:02:03.547 --> 00:02:06.516
"to learn of the other adverse effects not listed

44
00:02:06.516 --> 00:02:09.460
"on the bottle for possible problems your medical specialist

45
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.352
"has not warned you about."

46
00:02:10.352 --> 00:02:11.520
<v ->Do you think I left something out?</v>

47
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.553
(laughter)

48
00:02:12.553 --> 00:02:13.597
<v Regina>That was like a</v>
<v ->A reminder.</v>

49
00:02:13.597 --> 00:02:15.363
<v Regina>reverse disclaimer.</v>
<v ->It is.</v>

50
00:02:15.363 --> 00:02:19.094
<v Regina>I love it and you did that with intention.</v>

51
00:02:19.094 --> 00:02:24.094
<v ->A very big intention, because in a subtle way,</v>

52
00:02:24.202 --> 00:02:27.402
when you look at all the commercials on television.

53
00:02:27.402 --> 00:02:30.068
How they have managed to convince people,

54
00:02:30.068 --> 00:02:33.816
side effects are slight and I'm starting to think,

55
00:02:33.816 --> 00:02:37.521
is a heart attack slight, is a coma slight,

56
00:02:37.521 --> 00:02:40.048
is a massive personality change?

57
00:02:40.048 --> 00:02:41.686
<v Regina>Internal bleeding.</v>
<v ->Exactly.</v>

58
00:02:41.686 --> 00:02:44.328
So, their definition has been ratcheted up,

59
00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:47.226
so I figured I had to have a disclaimer.

60
00:02:47.226 --> 00:02:48.925
<v Regina>I thought that was excellent.</v>

61
00:02:48.925 --> 00:02:49.685
<v ->Thank you.
<v Regina>So, anyway</v>

62
00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:52.659
it set me laughing and then I got into the first chapter,

63
00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.702
which we go into Rife, which you and I talked about

64
00:02:54.702 --> 00:02:57.606
in our first interview and I got angry all over again

65
00:02:57.606 --> 00:02:58.809
at the suppression of these technologies.

66
00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:02.329
<v ->Oh Regina, my idea's supposed to make people happy.</v>

67
00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.608
<v Regina>No, I was not happy, but this is good, because</v>

68
00:03:04.608 --> 00:03:06.874
I think I wanna take on a new project because of this.

69
00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:08.614
This really steamed me up.

70
00:03:08.614 --> 00:03:13.188
So, we've talked about Rife and the tragic end of his life.

71
00:03:13.188 --> 00:03:14.794
<v ->Right.
<v Regina>I mean,</v>

72
00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:19.193
to invent something of such major medical significance

73
00:03:19.193 --> 00:03:22.334
and to be heralded in the newspaper with all the doctors

74
00:03:22.334 --> 00:03:25.056
in their tuxedos saying the end of cancer.

75
00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:27.565
And then, to be systematically discredited, destroyed

76
00:03:27.565 --> 00:03:28.792
to the point of bitterness and alcoholism.

77
00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:32.635
<v ->But, Regina it is a matter of the course of what happens.</v>

78
00:03:32.635 --> 00:03:36.514
If you look at Semmelweis who wanted to save

79
00:03:36.514 --> 00:03:39.248
so many women's lives and just tried

80
00:03:39.248 --> 00:03:42.318
to have doctors wash their hands

81
00:03:42.318 --> 00:03:47.114
between deliveries and he literally was thrown,

82
00:03:47.114 --> 00:03:51.229
he was thrown in an insane asylum where he died.

83
00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.909
And, it wasn't until years later that

84
00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.233
that became more standard practice.

85
00:03:57.233 --> 00:04:00.303
So, what's happened to these doctors now

86
00:04:00.303 --> 00:04:01.630
is really nothing new.

87
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.770
<v Regina>And, this was because children were dying,</v>

88
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.637
they were dying of birth bed or child of bed fever

89
00:04:08.637 --> 00:04:09.872
after birth because
<v Steven>Absolutely.</v>

90
00:04:09.872 --> 00:04:11.814
<v Regina>they were using dirty hands to deliver babies.</v>

91
00:04:11.814 --> 00:04:16.419
<v ->The doctor's never washed their hands and they would go to</v>

92
00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.016
mother after mother after mother, delivery after delivery

93
00:04:20.016 --> 00:04:21.856
and not even think about it.

94
00:04:21.856 --> 00:04:26.290
Once Semmelweis instituted that, it was so dramatic

95
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.095
that literally anybody could see that, however.

96
00:04:30.095 --> 00:04:31.667
<v Regina>The survival rate of both the mothers</v>

97
00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:34.270
and the babies.
<v Steven>Was tremendous.</v>

98
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.836
But most of the times in science,

99
00:04:37.836 --> 00:04:41.733
people do not like to leave their sacred cows

100
00:04:41.733 --> 00:04:44.439
or have to look beyond what they're doing.

101
00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:49.439
So, my book really contains people from the 20's,

102
00:04:49.743 --> 00:04:52.756
but this has been going on for a very, very long time.

103
00:04:52.756 --> 00:04:54.923
<v Regina>And, (clears throat) with Semmelweis</v>

104
00:04:54.923 --> 00:04:56.852
you're looking at something that to us it seems,

105
00:04:56.852 --> 00:04:59.393
oh well that was just silly, these were barbaric people

106
00:04:59.393 --> 00:05:02.497
that didn't understand the difference, but I would say

107
00:05:02.497 --> 00:05:05.868
that the very same forces that are stopping the forwarding

108
00:05:05.868 --> 00:05:08.132
of the technologies that really do work

109
00:05:08.132 --> 00:05:10.202
are every bit as barbaric as the doctors

110
00:05:10.202 --> 00:05:14.333
that essentially humiliated and ostracized Semmelweis

111
00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:17.007
for having them just simply consider washing their hands.

112
00:05:17.007 --> 00:05:19.124
<v ->No, that's true.
<v Regina>It's that barbaric</v>

113
00:05:19.124 --> 00:05:21.178
today.
<v Steven>And maybe</v>

114
00:05:21.178 --> 00:05:25.817
that springs and, the subtitle of my book I really wrote has

115
00:05:25.817 --> 00:05:28.793
greed, ego and vested interest.

116
00:05:28.793 --> 00:05:32.756
Semmelweis it had to do with ego, it really wasn't greed.

117
00:05:32.756 --> 00:05:37.465
Today, it's mostly greed, but in those days it was ego.

118
00:05:37.465 --> 00:05:41.226
It's the ego of individuals who have to be so right,

119
00:05:41.226 --> 00:05:44.742
because they are designated as the expert.

120
00:05:44.742 --> 00:05:46.941
And, that of course could be a whole discussion on

121
00:05:46.941 --> 00:05:49.902
what really is an expert.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

122
00:05:49.902 --> 00:05:51.447
<v ->But, we don't have time for that.</v>

123
00:05:51.447 --> 00:05:53.073
<v Regina>Oh god well we may towards the end,</v>

124
00:05:53.073 --> 00:05:56.707
we have so much, okay, so the point of our discussion today

125
00:05:56.707 --> 00:06:00.459
is I wanted to have you share some of, a little smattering

126
00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:05.198
of what it is in this book of some examples of what has been

127
00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:09.298
withheld from the public, the type of doctors and people,

128
00:06:09.298 --> 00:06:11.994
inventors that were bringing these technologies out,

129
00:06:11.994 --> 00:06:14.544
the kinds of results they were having, and again

130
00:06:14.544 --> 00:06:16.240
what happened to these individuals.

131
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.198
<v ->Sure.
<v Regina>Because, I think</v>

132
00:06:17.198 --> 00:06:19.942
this needs to be pounded home to us over and over and over,

133
00:06:19.942 --> 00:06:22.407
until we simply will not take this anymore.

134
00:06:22.407 --> 00:06:25.115
So, let's start out, I want to talk about Bjorn Nordenstrom,

135
00:06:25.115 --> 00:06:25.642
if you don't mind.

136
00:06:25.642 --> 00:06:27.108
<v ->Sure.
<v Regina>So, pick it up</v>

137
00:06:27.108 --> 00:06:29.309
from Rife and take it to Bjorn and tell us

138
00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:30.718
what's happened through today.

139
00:06:30.718 --> 00:06:33.657
<v ->I became interested in Bjorn Nordenstrom</v>

140
00:06:33.657 --> 00:06:37.213
for a couple reasons, one when I was informed

141
00:06:37.213 --> 00:06:40.031
he was the chairman of the Nobel Assembly

142
00:06:40.031 --> 00:06:42.959
that selects the Nobel Laureates in Medicine.

143
00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:45.700
And, he was doing a technique having to do with

144
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.700
electromagnetism, which was shrinking female breast cancer

145
00:06:51.572 --> 00:06:56.276
tumors and stomach tumors with electricity.

146
00:06:56.276 --> 00:06:59.344
This really had me stimulated and excited,

147
00:06:59.344 --> 00:07:02.247
because a lot of times people will discount

148
00:07:02.247 --> 00:07:04.209
some of these experts by saying,

149
00:07:04.209 --> 00:07:06.611
well this person really doesn't have any credibility

150
00:07:06.611 --> 00:07:09.016
and this particular individual is not degreed,

151
00:07:09.016 --> 00:07:14.016
but here we have a past chairman of the Nobel Assembly

152
00:07:14.019 --> 00:07:17.400
and the discoverer of needle biopsy, which is used

153
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.030
in virtually every hospital in the world.

154
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.538
So, I flew or my organization flew Dr. Nordenstrom out

155
00:07:24.538 --> 00:07:27.997
from Karolinska Institute in Sweden

156
00:07:27.997 --> 00:07:32.813
and brought him to our first World Congress in 1986,

157
00:07:32.813 --> 00:07:35.206
which was held in the Los Angeles area.

158
00:07:35.206 --> 00:07:38.781
Now, a couple things in line with what you're saying Regina

159
00:07:38.781 --> 00:07:42.841
is Nordenstrom was complaining to me how

160
00:07:42.841 --> 00:07:47.056
he was being labeled an alternative medical practitioner

161
00:07:47.056 --> 00:07:47.761
(laughter)

162
00:07:47.761 --> 00:07:50.411
because he was working with something

163
00:07:50.411 --> 00:07:54.969
outside the legal parameters which was surgery,

164
00:07:54.969 --> 00:07:58.275
(clears throat) chemotherapy, and radiation for cancer.

165
00:07:58.275 --> 00:08:01.772
Here is a man with incredible credentials

166
00:08:01.772 --> 00:08:04.017
and it's alternative.

167
00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:07.075
He also was complaining that (clears throat), excuse me,

168
00:08:07.075 --> 00:08:11.999
all the interviews that he had given at the very end,

169
00:08:12.849 --> 00:08:15.517
newspapers like the Los Angeles Times,

170
00:08:15.517 --> 00:08:19.454
were really knocking him and his theories.

171
00:08:19.454 --> 00:08:21.554
What he actually did was, he discovered

172
00:08:21.554 --> 00:08:25.763
that as a cancer tumor is growing, there is a change

173
00:08:25.763 --> 00:08:29.403
in the electrical potential, the positive charge

174
00:08:29.403 --> 00:08:32.602
and in a very simplistic way, sticking a probe

175
00:08:32.602 --> 00:08:36.736
in the middle of the tumor, he basically created, oh

176
00:08:36.736 --> 00:08:40.479
a good analogy would be, a PAC Man type reaction where

177
00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:45.464
the white cells went and attacked and ate this tumor up.

178
00:08:45.914 --> 00:08:49.127
And, if he visualized a PAC Man literally eating it up.

179
00:08:49.127 --> 00:08:52.185
No side effects, no problems.

180
00:08:52.185 --> 00:08:55.727
While he was out, the news program 20/20

181
00:08:55.727 --> 00:08:59.942
came to our conference, interviews Dr. Nordenstrom

182
00:08:59.942 --> 00:09:03.230
and believe it or not, that interview was shown

183
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.639
two years later when we were having our

184
00:09:05.639 --> 00:09:09.312
second World Congress, exactly on that weekend.

185
00:09:09.312 --> 00:09:12.570
Some of the interviewed doctors stated,

186
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.254
we don't have time to learn anything new

187
00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:18.857
and we have no comment on Dr. Nordenstrom.

188
00:09:18.857 --> 00:09:22.992
And, that to me is ego right there.

189
00:09:22.992 --> 00:09:26.023
But, his technique was ignored here.

190
00:09:26.023 --> 00:09:30.123
He eventually goes to China, which was the only country

191
00:09:30.123 --> 00:09:34.034
that would really give him the time of day.

192
00:09:34.034 --> 00:09:38.992
He writes his patent and gives it to the people

193
00:09:39.242 --> 00:09:43.482
and eventually, over 2,000 medical doctors

194
00:09:43.482 --> 00:09:46.809
were using this therapy on I believe

195
00:09:46.809 --> 00:09:51.717
about 17,000 patients with a 75% success rate.

196
00:09:52.607 --> 00:09:54.558
<v Regina>And again, (clears throat) inexpensive,</v>

197
00:09:54.558 --> 00:09:57.108
non-toxic and all of the above.

198
00:09:57.108 --> 00:10:00.432
And so, China embraced it and you know, it's interesting

199
00:10:00.432 --> 00:10:03.031
because at the end of each of your chapters reflects

200
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:06.250
the title of your book, here this man brought this

201
00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:10.133
incredible knowledge and therapy forward

202
00:10:10.133 --> 00:10:12.707
that the medical community could have as easily,

203
00:10:12.707 --> 00:10:16.402
if it weren't for their own egos and stubbornness, embraced.

204
00:10:16.402 --> 00:10:19.446
And instead, as you say, and nothing happened.

205
00:10:19.446 --> 00:10:22.235
<v ->And, I'm gonna put a little sidebar in here,</v>

206
00:10:22.235 --> 00:10:26.049
because (clears throat), excuse me, we are making it,

207
00:10:26.049 --> 00:10:28.888
I think trying to get people to understand.

208
00:10:28.888 --> 00:10:32.665
When I hear about the run for the cure, the walk

209
00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:36.033
for the cure, (clears throat) and all this money, people

210
00:10:36.033 --> 00:10:41.026
wearing the different bows, I get a little upset myself.

211
00:10:41.026 --> 00:10:45.171
Not because the people aren't well meaning, but as far as

212
00:10:45.171 --> 00:10:48.009
I'm concerned, I'm gonna be very explicit here,

213
00:10:48.009 --> 00:10:51.206
they're being duped, because where

214
00:10:51.206 --> 00:10:54.544
is that money going that is being raised?

215
00:10:54.544 --> 00:10:58.221
We just mentioned the chairman of the Nobel Assembly.

216
00:10:58.221 --> 00:11:02.513
What percentage of this research money has gone into

217
00:11:02.513 --> 00:11:06.990
his theory or electromagnetics, zero.

218
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.033
<v Regina>Exactly, where is it going?</v>

219
00:11:09.033 --> 00:11:11.359
<v ->Well that really, of course, is the question.</v>

220
00:11:11.359 --> 00:11:12.636
<v Regina>Nobody knows where it's going</v>

221
00:11:12.636 --> 00:11:15.759
and we're talking hundreds of millions of dollars.

222
00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:17.709
<v ->Absolutely.
<v Regina>I'm the same as you</v>

223
00:11:17.709 --> 00:11:20.307
and I always have been, for the same reasons,

224
00:11:20.307 --> 00:11:22.413
because this is a passion of mine as well.

225
00:11:22.413 --> 00:11:24.977
I see those pink.

226
00:11:24.977 --> 00:11:26.785
Those little pink ribbons
<v Steven>Right.</v>

227
00:11:26.785 --> 00:11:29.516
<v Regina>that grace all of these advertisements throughout</v>

228
00:11:29.516 --> 00:11:34.372
all of the women's magazines and I become fumed.

229
00:11:34.372 --> 00:11:36.792
I'm really fuming every single time I see it,

230
00:11:36.792 --> 00:11:39.318
for the exact same reason, we're being duped.

231
00:11:39.318 --> 00:11:41.009
No one's looking for a cure, the cure

232
00:11:41.009 --> 00:11:41.524
has been there all along.
<v Steven>And, if people</v>

233
00:11:41.524 --> 00:11:44.289
really knew how much was out there.

234
00:11:44.289 --> 00:11:44.600
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

235
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.833
<v ->Then, I believe they would really be upset.</v>

236
00:11:47.833 --> 00:11:49.936
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->But, because there is not</v>

237
00:11:49.936 --> 00:11:52.806
much publicity, because people don't know

238
00:11:52.806 --> 00:11:56.142
and thank goodness for a show like yours

239
00:11:56.142 --> 00:11:59.750
and the dedication that you and Scott have

240
00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:04.442
to be doing this type of informing people,

241
00:12:04.442 --> 00:12:06.236
nobody would know about it.

242
00:12:06.236 --> 00:12:09.781
And yet, these researchers who supposedly are looking

243
00:12:09.781 --> 00:12:12.594
for an answer, should have known about this.

244
00:12:12.594 --> 00:12:13.495
<v Regina>They should have and sometimes</v>

245
00:12:13.495 --> 00:12:16.630
they do actually know and choose to

246
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.495
basically turn a deaf ear, because this cuts into profit.

247
00:12:19.495 --> 00:12:21.754
And this is the thing, it costs $100 million

248
00:12:21.754 --> 00:12:23.865
to get a drug to market, right?

249
00:12:23.865 --> 00:12:26.000
So, do you think that they're not going to proceed

250
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.375
on that track and make sure that it's indoctrinated

251
00:12:28.375 --> 00:12:31.583
through the educational process of our MDs.

252
00:12:31.583 --> 00:12:33.206
It's all funded by the pharmaceuticals

253
00:12:33.206 --> 00:12:36.129
and it's a very sick and corrupt industry.

254
00:12:36.129 --> 00:12:39.183
<v ->And we have to say, before we move on,</v>

255
00:12:39.183 --> 00:12:42.691
a lot of my examples were from the 20's, 30's, and 40's.

256
00:12:42.691 --> 00:12:44.530
<v Regina>Right.</v>
<v ->This is from</v>

257
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.326
the 1970's, 80's, and 90's.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

258
00:12:47.326 --> 00:12:51.304
<v ->So, there's really no excuse for something like this</v>

259
00:12:51.304 --> 00:12:53.404
disappearing, dropping off the shelf.

260
00:12:53.404 --> 00:12:55.134
<v Regina>But, in reality there was no excuse for the stuff</v>

261
00:12:55.134 --> 00:12:57.605
in the 20's and 30's dropping off.

262
00:12:57.605 --> 00:13:00.640
There was a concerted effort by the then pharmaceutical,

263
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.165
well known family that ran the pharmaceutical industry.

264
00:13:03.165 --> 00:13:05.514
<v ->This is true, but I try to keep just at the mere</v>

265
00:13:05.514 --> 00:13:07.276
quiet image as just a
<v Regina>Yeah, well.</v>

266
00:13:07.276 --> 00:13:08.309
<v ->humble librarian.
<v Regina>I'm going to</v>

267
00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:11.782
help you today Steven, as demure you are.

268
00:13:11.782 --> 00:13:15.547
Okay, so anyway, so 75% success rate.

269
00:13:15.547 --> 00:13:18.148
2,300 doctors in China actually have

270
00:13:18.148 --> 00:13:19.646
used this technique.
<v Steven>Right.</v>

271
00:13:19.646 --> 00:13:21.886
<v Regina>And so, good for them, good for them.</v>

272
00:13:21.886 --> 00:13:23.097
We don't have the courage to do it

273
00:13:23.097 --> 00:13:25.047
though at least somebody does.

274
00:13:25.047 --> 00:13:27.597
I wanna go to Dinshah and we did talk about him

275
00:13:27.597 --> 00:13:29.060
very briefly hit on him

276
00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.073
in our first interview.
<v Steven>Right.</v>

277
00:13:30.073 --> 00:13:31.239
Chromotherapy.
<v Regina>But, I think it's</v>

278
00:13:31.239 --> 00:13:33.538
very important to go into Chromotherapy, 'cause again

279
00:13:33.538 --> 00:13:37.141
it's pervasive, it's part of nature, sunshine, color.

280
00:13:37.141 --> 00:13:38.982
<v ->The rainbow.
<v Regina>The rainbow.</v>

281
00:13:38.982 --> 00:13:41.153
<v ->God's covenant.
<v Regina>Hello.</v>

282
00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:45.279
<v ->There is a lot there and Dinshah Ghadiali was from India</v>

283
00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:50.279
in the late 1800's, basically developed a 12 color system.

284
00:13:53.227 --> 00:13:55.489
That's the use of 12 colors of the

285
00:13:55.489 --> 00:13:57.918
visible spectrum to do healing.

286
00:13:57.918 --> 00:13:59.535
Now, I'm gonna jump a little bit ahead

287
00:13:59.535 --> 00:14:01.206
before we talk about the techniques

288
00:14:01.206 --> 00:14:03.536
so we catch some of your listeners.

289
00:14:03.536 --> 00:14:06.504
I've given many lectures, as you know, around the world

290
00:14:06.504 --> 00:14:09.697
and I'll get a professional in the audience,

291
00:14:09.697 --> 00:14:12.942
a doctor sometimes that go, oh this color therapy,

292
00:14:12.942 --> 00:14:14.907
I just, that can't be possible.

293
00:14:14.907 --> 00:14:17.485
And I'll say, oh doctor by the way, what do you do

294
00:14:17.485 --> 00:14:20.888
with infant liver syndrome, bilirubin?

295
00:14:20.888 --> 00:14:22.025
Well, we put the--

296
00:14:22.025 --> 00:14:23.133
<v Regina>Jaundice, yellow jaundice in babies.</v>

297
00:14:23.133 --> 00:14:24.456
<v ->Yes, yellow jaundice.</v>

298
00:14:24.456 --> 00:14:25.830
Now, the doctor never finishes.

299
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:29.153
I go you were gonna say you put them under a blue light

300
00:14:29.153 --> 00:14:33.833
and that is color therapy, because it is 100% fatality

301
00:14:33.833 --> 00:14:38.128
if they are not placed under those blue lights.

302
00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:41.370
And so, I don't know what you call it doctor,

303
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:44.177
that is color therapy (clears throat).

304
00:14:44.177 --> 00:14:46.081
<v Regina>You can hear a pin drop after that I bet.</v>

305
00:14:46.081 --> 00:14:50.482
<v ->Absolutely, because people don't realize that there are</v>

306
00:14:50.482 --> 00:14:54.847
some of these techniques being used in let's say,

307
00:14:54.847 --> 00:14:58.436
not the direct way, only one color's being used,

308
00:14:58.436 --> 00:14:59.656
which is the blue.

309
00:14:59.656 --> 00:15:04.202
However, there is a whole system that Dinshah developed

310
00:15:04.202 --> 00:15:09.202
which really addresses over 320 different health problems,

311
00:15:10.068 --> 00:15:12.782
all using this 12 color system.

312
00:15:12.782 --> 00:15:14.710
What happened to him, well he was thrown in jail

313
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.941
about six times and eight different prisons,

314
00:15:17.941 --> 00:15:22.817
because he had this dastardly therapy using color.

315
00:15:22.817 --> 00:15:24.748
<v Regina>Color and light.</v>

316
00:15:24.748 --> 00:15:29.661
<v ->Unbelievable, now here's what I often like to share also.</v>

317
00:15:29.661 --> 00:15:32.317
I have never heard any report, anywhere in the world

318
00:15:32.317 --> 00:15:35.685
that said, Mary Jane Smith was found ODed,

319
00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:38.320
her color projector still running (laughs)

320
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.130
and she was just slumped down.

321
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.429
You just don't really hear.

322
00:15:42.429 --> 00:15:46.173
Now, people will say well how can you have something

323
00:15:46.173 --> 00:15:48.410
good like this, what about the negative parts?

324
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:52.210
And, I use this example, if you had a glass of water

325
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:56.406
or a glass and it was filled with water, pouring more water

326
00:15:56.406 --> 00:15:59.719
only spills over the sides, but doesn't break the glass.

327
00:15:59.719 --> 00:16:03.079
And, color therapy has the unique properties

328
00:16:03.079 --> 00:16:08.066
of a tremendous upside, but very little downside or

329
00:16:09.416 --> 00:16:12.735
negativity to it or adverse effects, it just doesn't happen.

330
00:16:12.735 --> 00:16:14.400
<v Regina>True, I mean even if you used it</v>

331
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.953
without any understanding at all and say you were

332
00:16:16.953 --> 00:16:19.439
an agitated person and you put the red light on you.

333
00:16:19.439 --> 00:16:22.176
Okay you might become a little more agitated at worst.

334
00:16:22.176 --> 00:16:23.540
That's like the worst thing that can happen.

335
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.540
<v ->Exactly.</v>

336
00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.002
<v Regina>And the rest of it is nothing but a bonus.</v>

337
00:16:27.002 --> 00:16:29.610
And, back then when you were into color therapy

338
00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:32.086
that was my passion, I read all the books in here.

339
00:16:32.086 --> 00:16:34.010
I love it, I was reading this as my own journey,

340
00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:35.791
because I read every book back then,

341
00:16:35.791 --> 00:16:38.189
in the early and mid 80's, on color therapy.

342
00:16:38.189 --> 00:16:39.691
<v ->And look how far you've come.</v>

343
00:16:39.691 --> 00:16:42.558
You travel over the world, I'm a librarian.

344
00:16:42.558 --> 00:16:44.562
So, you've obviously done a lot with it.

345
00:16:44.562 --> 00:16:45.764
<v Regina>Well, one thing I used to do is</v>

346
00:16:45.764 --> 00:16:49.533
I would give lectures on it, like you were and do groups

347
00:16:49.533 --> 00:16:52.136
and I would tell the group, "Close your eyes."

348
00:16:52.136 --> 00:16:54.664
so that no one could see what was going on

349
00:16:54.664 --> 00:16:57.445
and then project colors on their bodies and tell them

350
00:16:57.445 --> 00:17:00.248
very spontaneously, start telling me what you're feeling.

351
00:17:00.248 --> 00:17:01.718
And, they would be, the group would be

352
00:17:01.718 --> 00:17:03.347
pretty much right on every time.

353
00:17:03.347 --> 00:17:06.482
They could feel the properties coming into the body.

354
00:17:06.482 --> 00:17:09.779
But, let's talk about some of the medical therapies, I mean

355
00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:12.327
the medical conditions they were using colored light for

356
00:17:12.327 --> 00:17:14.221
back then, and I want to go into Kate Baldwin.

357
00:17:14.221 --> 00:17:15.785
<v ->And, I think the most dramatic,</v>

358
00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:17.471
let's go into Kate Baldwin.

359
00:17:17.471 --> 00:17:20.929
I have pictures in my book of little Grace Shirlow.

360
00:17:20.929 --> 00:17:23.269
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->Who had third degree burns</v>

361
00:17:23.269 --> 00:17:27.670
over 2/3 of her body, now that is death, I mean.

362
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:32.670
That results generally in death because it's just, the body

363
00:17:32.815 --> 00:17:36.353
is just under too much pressure, it's being overwhelmed.

364
00:17:36.353 --> 00:17:39.222
And, this little girl was given color therapy

365
00:17:39.222 --> 00:17:44.056
by Kate Baldwin back in the 1920's.

366
00:17:44.056 --> 00:17:45.809
<v Regina>And, she was a senior surgeon.</v>

367
00:17:45.809 --> 00:17:49.832
<v ->Well, she was, that was the oldest surgical hospital,</v>

368
00:17:49.832 --> 00:17:53.154
Philadelphia Women's Hospital, in the United States,

369
00:17:53.154 --> 00:17:58.037
senior surgeon, the woman's credentials were impeccable

370
00:17:58.037 --> 00:18:02.243
and she treats this little girl and after one hour

371
00:18:02.243 --> 00:18:06.514
Grace Shirlow never had pain again from the burns.

372
00:18:06.514 --> 00:18:11.281
Now, I didn't say not the rest of that day, Grace Shirlow

373
00:18:11.281 --> 00:18:16.281
had no topical application, no pain from the burns,

374
00:18:16.527 --> 00:18:20.227
and regrew baby skin.

375
00:18:20.227 --> 00:18:23.225
<v Regina>And, when you see these photographs it's pretty.</v>

376
00:18:23.225 --> 00:18:24.660
<v ->It's very traumatic.
<v Regina>It's very painful</v>

377
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.067
just to look at the condition she'd been in with this black

378
00:18:27.067 --> 00:18:30.703
charred skin all over her body and never had pain again.

379
00:18:30.703 --> 00:18:34.676
I mean, okay so obviously Kate Baldwin became a believer.

380
00:18:34.676 --> 00:18:37.292
I mean, how many, she had what, as I recall something like

381
00:18:37.292 --> 00:18:39.238
17 of these machines in her hospital.

382
00:18:39.238 --> 00:18:43.352
<v ->Exactly, until pressure came from the AMA,</v>

383
00:18:43.352 --> 00:18:47.049
the American Medical Association, telling doctors

384
00:18:47.049 --> 00:18:50.048
that they should not work with color

385
00:18:50.048 --> 00:18:53.429
or there's a likelihood they would lose their license.

386
00:18:53.429 --> 00:18:58.020
Now, the Board of Directors at Philadelphia Woman's Hospital

387
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.858
called Kate Baldwin in, we actually have the minutes

388
00:19:00.858 --> 00:19:03.840
of those meetings, and wanted her

389
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.977
to explain what she was doing.

390
00:19:06.977 --> 00:19:10.314
She explained, they saw the results, and

391
00:19:10.314 --> 00:19:12.983
they let her practice for another couple of months

392
00:19:12.983 --> 00:19:17.064
and then, the board said, we've been told,

393
00:19:17.064 --> 00:19:18.980
you either give up the machines

394
00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.389
or you give up your position in the hospital.

395
00:19:21.389 --> 00:19:24.424
Now, the oldest surgical hospital,

396
00:19:24.424 --> 00:19:29.103
and think of a woman in those days in that position,

397
00:19:29.103 --> 00:19:32.625
she gave up her position rather than go

398
00:19:32.625 --> 00:19:36.259
one day without the use of color therapy.

399
00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:41.065
That was an amazing woman and when you think about it,

400
00:19:41.065 --> 00:19:46.017
how strong in her conviction and when she has listed,

401
00:19:46.017 --> 00:19:50.241
which she has in her memoirs, all the different conditions

402
00:19:50.241 --> 00:19:52.488
that she cured using color.

403
00:19:52.488 --> 00:19:53.913
Amazing.
<v Regina>Can you give a few?</v>

404
00:19:53.913 --> 00:19:57.253
<v ->Well, it was every thing, gonorrhea, syphilis, polio,</v>

405
00:19:57.253 --> 00:20:01.031
burns, cancer, arthritis.
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>

406
00:20:01.031 --> 00:20:03.298
<v ->And again, who are we talking about?</v>

407
00:20:03.298 --> 00:20:08.292
We're talking about a senior surgeon, not somebody

408
00:20:08.582 --> 00:20:12.714
who kind of thought maybe there was a little reaction.

409
00:20:12.714 --> 00:20:15.903
This was documented and some of her cases appeared

410
00:20:15.903 --> 00:20:20.756
in medical journals, but they were just bypassed.

411
00:20:21.551 --> 00:20:24.120
<v Regina>And so again, this was a beautiful,</v>

412
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.321
subtle technology that.
<v Steven>Right.</v>

413
00:20:26.321 --> 00:20:27.992
<v Regina>I personally believe every human being</v>

414
00:20:27.992 --> 00:20:29.673
can benefit, to this day.
<v Steven>Absolutely.</v>

415
00:20:29.673 --> 00:20:31.695
I feel the same.
<v Regina>From color therapy.</v>

416
00:20:31.695 --> 00:20:34.954
If nothing else, to revitalize yourself when you're feeling

417
00:20:34.954 --> 00:20:37.623
low on energy, to boost the immune system.

418
00:20:37.623 --> 00:20:40.233
<v ->I've only found one thing that it doesn't work.</v>

419
00:20:40.233 --> 00:20:41.749
<v Regina>Growing hair (laughs)?</v>

420
00:20:41.749 --> 00:20:44.954
<v ->You are so sharp, only because you've known me this long</v>

421
00:20:44.954 --> 00:20:46.065
would you
<v Regina>Could I say that.</v>

422
00:20:46.065 --> 00:20:49.843
<v ->steal my big punchline from me, but that's exactly right.</v>

423
00:20:49.843 --> 00:20:52.335
Everything else it has been very successful.

424
00:20:52.335 --> 00:20:56.172
And, I have to say for demonstration purposes only,

425
00:20:56.172 --> 00:20:59.891
because I would never do therapy or treat people,

426
00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:04.114
but I happen to show some people what's in our archives

427
00:21:04.114 --> 00:21:08.763
and that's been about like, just about 800 people.

428
00:21:08.763 --> 00:21:12.422
I know how effective that color can be,

429
00:21:12.422 --> 00:21:15.066
because when we've been demonstrating to people,

430
00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:18.668
it's worked very well on a multitude of cases.

431
00:21:18.668 --> 00:21:21.572
<v Regina>Right, right, so this is something people</v>

432
00:21:21.572 --> 00:21:23.643
can begin looking into just as you and I did.

433
00:21:23.643 --> 00:21:25.139
Back in the 80's there weren't that many books on

434
00:21:25.139 --> 00:21:27.048
color therapy available then.
<v ->That's true.</v>

435
00:21:27.048 --> 00:21:28.252
<v Regina>There are a lot more now.</v>

436
00:21:28.252 --> 00:21:29.010
<v ->Right.
<v Regina>And there are</v>

437
00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.885
some actual, some really good color practitioners

438
00:21:31.885 --> 00:21:33.786
and equipment available out there for anybody

439
00:21:33.786 --> 00:21:35.524
who wants to just kind of take it on themselves,

440
00:21:35.524 --> 00:21:38.561
for their own home use revitalization system.

441
00:21:38.561 --> 00:21:42.030
<v ->It's very inexpensive, you use AC current out of the wall</v>

442
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:46.939
and I did write in my book, that my father who was diagnosed

443
00:21:47.369 --> 00:21:51.457
at one of the leading HMOs in the United States.

444
00:21:51.457 --> 00:21:54.876
My mother was told my father would be a quadriplegic

445
00:21:54.876 --> 00:21:58.012
the rest of his life with a neurogenic bladder,

446
00:21:58.012 --> 00:22:00.438
he'd never urinate again on his own.

447
00:22:00.438 --> 00:22:05.384
And, my mom went into the hospital, treated my father

448
00:22:05.554 --> 00:22:08.857
with the color therapy twice a day for one hour

449
00:22:08.857 --> 00:22:12.818
and six weeks later, he walked out of this hospital.

450
00:22:12.818 --> 00:22:15.798
We have all the medical records and in those days

451
00:22:15.798 --> 00:22:18.477
it was hard to get, because it was '84,

452
00:22:18.477 --> 00:22:21.959
but he walks out of the hospital on two canes

453
00:22:21.959 --> 00:22:24.704
after using the color therapy, and by the way,

454
00:22:24.704 --> 00:22:29.013
my dad's therapy was one hour of AC current, so it was

455
00:22:29.013 --> 00:22:33.976
about six or seven cents per day therapy for seven weeks.

456
00:22:35.016 --> 00:22:37.052
<v Regina>That puts it in perspective doesn't it?</v>

457
00:22:37.052 --> 00:22:41.124
<v ->Well, that gets to the financial consideration absolutely.</v>

458
00:22:41.124 --> 00:22:44.209
<v Regina>Yes, and along the line, because what</v>

459
00:22:44.209 --> 00:22:47.528
we're talking about, essentially everything in this book

460
00:22:47.528 --> 00:22:49.632
and everything we've talked about thus far and in our

461
00:22:49.632 --> 00:22:53.608
previous interview has to do with vibrational healing and

462
00:22:53.608 --> 00:22:56.900
a lot of it has to do with the electrical field of the body,

463
00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.972
which science totally, I mean virtually dismisses.

464
00:22:59.972 --> 00:23:04.972
Even though, anyone that studies medical history of and

465
00:23:06.774 --> 00:23:09.520
studies the heart understands this is an electrical device.

466
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.006
<v ->Every physicist, but (clears throat) let's go</v>

467
00:23:12.006 --> 00:23:14.619
let's put it even closer to home.

468
00:23:14.619 --> 00:23:18.456
What determines death for the medical profession?

469
00:23:18.456 --> 00:23:20.351
Heartbeat and brain waves.

470
00:23:20.351 --> 00:23:22.497
<v Regina>Right, electrical circuits, basically.</v>

471
00:23:22.497 --> 00:23:24.967
<v ->Of course they are, they're both electrical.</v>

472
00:23:24.967 --> 00:23:26.402
They're not chemical.

473
00:23:26.402 --> 00:23:29.271
In the very old days they used to believe, no first

474
00:23:29.271 --> 00:23:32.040
there was a chemical reaction which lead to electrical,

475
00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.271
but science has really proved, first there is

476
00:23:35.271 --> 00:23:38.943
the electrical which releases the chemicals

477
00:23:38.943 --> 00:23:42.546
and we have all these fields that surround the body.

478
00:23:42.546 --> 00:23:46.220
So, if we are using the determination of heartbeat

479
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.822
and brainwaves and electrical, why aren't our therapies

480
00:23:49.822 --> 00:23:52.211
addressing that?
<v Regina>Exactly.</v>

481
00:23:52.211 --> 00:23:54.381
Well, that brings us to.
<v Steven>Well, I thought</v>

482
00:23:54.381 --> 00:23:56.690
a lot about it, that's why I don't have hair anymore.

483
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:57.132
(laughter)

484
00:23:57.132 --> 00:23:58.276
So, I can't think about it anymore.

485
00:23:58.276 --> 00:23:59.651
<v Regina>You burned that surface.</v>

486
00:23:59.651 --> 00:24:02.202
<v ->I've burned it out, I can't think about that.</v>

487
00:24:02.202 --> 00:24:04.551
<v Regina>Okay, so doctor George Crile, because this</v>

488
00:24:04.551 --> 00:24:07.510
takes us right into his work, because he actually

489
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:10.843
made that observation in a very personal way

490
00:24:10.843 --> 00:24:12.738
via the death of a friend of his, as I recall.

491
00:24:12.738 --> 00:24:13.850
<v ->That's correct.
<v Regina>So, let's talk</v>

492
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:15.247
about his whole story.

493
00:24:15.247 --> 00:24:18.949
<v ->Well, George Crile was one of the original</v>

494
00:24:18.949 --> 00:24:21.616
founding members of the establishment called

495
00:24:21.616 --> 00:24:24.926
the Cleveland Clinic, which still exists and is very famous

496
00:24:24.926 --> 00:24:27.988
in the midwest, the Cleveland Clinic is very big.

497
00:24:27.988 --> 00:24:30.764
And George Crile, when he was going

498
00:24:30.764 --> 00:24:34.913
to med school and as he says in his books,

499
00:24:34.913 --> 00:24:39.409
he was taught certain aspects of medicine.

500
00:24:39.409 --> 00:24:41.074
Well, a very good friend of his,

501
00:24:41.074 --> 00:24:46.033
who was also a medical student, was hit by a horse and buggy

502
00:24:47.113 --> 00:24:51.054
and brought into the hospital basically in shock.

503
00:24:51.054 --> 00:24:55.037
Now, what really surprised George Crile was

504
00:24:55.037 --> 00:24:59.994
basically why was his system actually going down?

505
00:25:00.674 --> 00:25:02.923
What was this thing having to do with shock,

506
00:25:02.923 --> 00:25:06.439
because there was not blood pouring out of his system?

507
00:25:06.439 --> 00:25:10.138
All of his organs were working properly, and if that

508
00:25:10.138 --> 00:25:13.173
was the case, according to what he's taught in medicine,

509
00:25:13.173 --> 00:25:17.444
why was his friend dying and eventually died?

510
00:25:17.444 --> 00:25:22.369
Why and who was his friend that this would happen?

511
00:25:23.009 --> 00:25:26.443
So, he started beginning, he began to do research

512
00:25:26.443 --> 00:25:29.115
on the human body trying to figure out,

513
00:25:29.115 --> 00:25:33.391
if the blood didn't pour out, if the organs are working,

514
00:25:33.391 --> 00:25:38.343
why did my friend die and why do other people die of shock?

515
00:25:38.593 --> 00:25:41.094
He eventually, of course, discovered like everyone else

516
00:25:41.094 --> 00:25:45.371
in the book, the body is electromagnetic and when there is

517
00:25:45.371 --> 00:25:50.348
an alteration in the electrical fields of the body,

518
00:25:50.478 --> 00:25:55.448
then there is a disintegration of how everything is working.

519
00:25:56.018 --> 00:25:57.775
He also made another discovery,

520
00:25:57.775 --> 00:26:00.451
which would take us a lot more time,

521
00:26:00.451 --> 00:26:04.639
but he discovered that there is cells in the body

522
00:26:04.639 --> 00:26:07.926
that convert sunlight.

523
00:26:07.926 --> 00:26:09.732
<v Regina>I want it, no I want you to go into depth</v>

524
00:26:09.732 --> 00:26:12.138
in this, I was going to ask you to do that.

525
00:26:12.138 --> 00:26:14.089
It's important 'cause it's the adrenals,

526
00:26:14.089 --> 00:26:15.233
the thyroid and the liver.

527
00:26:15.233 --> 00:26:18.571
<v ->That's exactly right, that is where the cells accumulate</v>

528
00:26:18.571 --> 00:26:23.571
and these cells are the converting mechanism that converts

529
00:26:26.213 --> 00:26:31.208
energy into the electromagnetic workings of the body.

530
00:26:32.882 --> 00:26:37.846
Now, if those particular cells get neutralized somehow

531
00:26:38.026 --> 00:26:41.127
and apparently it could be just the same way

532
00:26:41.127 --> 00:26:42.827
when we think of a battery.

533
00:26:42.827 --> 00:26:46.993
That all of the sudden the battery, the charge is just lost.

534
00:26:46.993 --> 00:26:48.869
Everything shuts down completely.

535
00:26:48.869 --> 00:26:50.569
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>
<v ->They can be recharged</v>

536
00:26:50.569 --> 00:26:54.667
up, a battery can, but when these cells,

537
00:26:54.667 --> 00:26:57.944
because there's a lack of light, there's a lack of sun,

538
00:26:57.944 --> 00:27:01.250
which makes sense for other things we know in medicine.

539
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:03.516
They are not pushing the energy

540
00:27:03.516 --> 00:27:07.329
to different parts of the body, everything closes down.

541
00:27:07.329 --> 00:27:10.355
That's what happened to his particular friend

542
00:27:10.355 --> 00:27:15.302
that because of the shock to the system, because these cells

543
00:27:15.632 --> 00:27:20.606
were not working efficiently anymore, everything wound down

544
00:27:20.976 --> 00:27:25.969
and literally drained out and George Crile could see this.

545
00:27:26.199 --> 00:27:30.240
Now, again because of time, let's look at George Crile.

546
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:34.817
Was he a weekend putterer in his garage?

547
00:27:34.817 --> 00:27:39.290
No, they actually named a crater of the moon after him.

548
00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:43.919
They actually named a battleship, the U.S.S. George Crile

549
00:27:43.919 --> 00:27:47.256
after him, so do we see a little bit of a trend here?

550
00:27:47.256 --> 00:27:50.693
We've got a past chairman of the Nobel Assembly, we have

551
00:27:50.693 --> 00:27:54.231
somebody that they're naming craters in the moon after.

552
00:27:54.231 --> 00:27:57.938
<v Regina>One of the first top female surgeons in America.</v>

553
00:27:57.938 --> 00:28:02.245
<v ->Absolutely, and they get overlooked, so the book is</v>

554
00:28:02.245 --> 00:28:07.140
not just about technologies, it is about what you started

555
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:10.916
this interview with, something is not right

556
00:28:10.916 --> 00:28:15.847
with what is going on here, because we have top,

557
00:28:16.117 --> 00:28:20.991
top people being overlooked for some reason.

558
00:28:20.991 --> 00:28:24.526
But, they are all saying the same thing, electromagnetics,

559
00:28:24.526 --> 00:28:28.470
frequency, magnetism, sound, color.

560
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:32.175
<v Regina>And the technologies are still out there.</v>

561
00:28:32.175 --> 00:28:33.136
<v ->They will always be there.</v>

562
00:28:33.136 --> 00:28:34.453
<v Regina>They've always been there.</v>

563
00:28:34.453 --> 00:28:34.971
<v ->They will.
<v Regina>I mean,</v>

564
00:28:34.971 --> 00:28:38.744
even just starting with the simple things like the sunshine

565
00:28:38.744 --> 00:28:40.949
itself and what that's doing to the organs of the body,

566
00:28:40.949 --> 00:28:42.818
which I tend to go on about quite a bit.

567
00:28:42.818 --> 00:28:45.291
I'm a big fan of getting a little sunshine.

568
00:28:45.291 --> 00:28:48.452
Okay, that leads us down into, 'cause you were talking

569
00:28:48.452 --> 00:28:53.327
about the heart and the electrical system, into Dr. Kern.

570
00:28:53.327 --> 00:28:57.701
That just, again I was hopping mad reading that.

571
00:28:57.701 --> 00:29:00.975
Why doesn't everybody have access to what he discovered?

572
00:29:00.975 --> 00:29:05.473
<v ->Well, Dr. Kern that was, I was very fortunate, in fact</v>

573
00:29:05.473 --> 00:29:10.410
you and I have shared I have a magical, beautiful life.

574
00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:12.955
I'm very grateful for the places I've been,

575
00:29:12.955 --> 00:29:17.021
the people I've met, but I happened to meet Dr. Kern

576
00:29:17.021 --> 00:29:20.654
a little bit before he passed away.

577
00:29:20.654 --> 00:29:22.987
Basically what he discovered was,

578
00:29:22.987 --> 00:29:26.260
he was surgeon on the battlefield.

579
00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.692
He was from Germany and there was a law

580
00:29:29.692 --> 00:29:34.692
even in their country, that any soldier that was killed,

581
00:29:35.071 --> 00:29:38.672
even if it seemed obvious, they had to do an autopsy.

582
00:29:38.672 --> 00:29:41.074
And, he made a very startling discovery.

583
00:29:41.074 --> 00:29:43.576
He found that 20 year old males

584
00:29:43.576 --> 00:29:48.576
had 85-90% occlusion in their main arteries.

585
00:29:48.677 --> 00:29:52.852
Now, occlusion means blockage, there was a blockage

586
00:29:52.852 --> 00:29:56.421
in their main arteries going to the heart.

587
00:29:56.421 --> 00:29:59.490
Now, according to our model and people are running in

588
00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:02.830
and getting bypass surgery, it's because they have

589
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.759
occluded arteries and supposedly blood

590
00:30:05.759 --> 00:30:07.125
isn't getting to the heart.

591
00:30:07.125 --> 00:30:10.264
<v Regina>And, stress is one of the major causes of that.</v>

592
00:30:10.264 --> 00:30:11.870
<v ->That is correct.
<v ->Because that's</v>

593
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:13.977
what ends up as plaque in the arteries.

594
00:30:13.977 --> 00:30:18.145
So, a 20 year old at war, that's enough stress

595
00:30:18.145 --> 00:30:19.579
to produce these blockages.

596
00:30:19.579 --> 00:30:21.952
<v ->But, what's interesting is, you never hear</v>

597
00:30:21.952 --> 00:30:24.618
of a 20 year old dying of a heart attack.

598
00:30:24.618 --> 00:30:25.746
<v Regina>Right.</v>
<v ->And, this is what</v>

599
00:30:25.746 --> 00:30:29.289
got Kern very interested in what he was doing.

600
00:30:29.289 --> 00:30:32.154
And, eventually what he discovered was

601
00:30:32.154 --> 00:30:34.211
and I'm gonna use an analogy.

602
00:30:34.211 --> 00:30:37.325
Let's take any big city that's got a freeway.

603
00:30:37.325 --> 00:30:39.953
Freeway gets clogged, you have an appointment

604
00:30:39.953 --> 00:30:41.739
you've gotta get to, I of course have to get

605
00:30:41.739 --> 00:30:45.029
to my hairstylist and so, what do I do?

606
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:48.145
I pull off the freeway and I take side streets.

607
00:30:48.145 --> 00:30:52.841
So, Dr. Kern said, wait a minute, if the main arteries

608
00:30:52.841 --> 00:30:55.839
are blocked, nature is so fantastic,

609
00:30:55.839 --> 00:30:58.945
there's gotta be what are called collaterals.

610
00:30:58.945 --> 00:31:03.481
Now, what he found was there are thousands

611
00:31:03.481 --> 00:31:08.361
of side streets leading blood to the heart,

612
00:31:08.361 --> 00:31:12.398
so if the main artery is blocked, more blood comes.

613
00:31:12.398 --> 00:31:17.398
Now, Dr. Baroldi of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology,

614
00:31:18.698 --> 00:31:21.334
he actually went a step further than Kern.

615
00:31:21.334 --> 00:31:24.573
He actually took pictures and found

616
00:31:24.573 --> 00:31:28.784
thousands of these collaterals feeding the heart

617
00:31:28.784 --> 00:31:31.418
and what he came out with and it was published

618
00:31:31.418 --> 00:31:35.409
in a medical magazine was, there is more blood

619
00:31:35.409 --> 00:31:39.611
coming to the heart if your main arteries are blocked.

620
00:31:39.611 --> 00:31:43.025
Now, the question people ask is, okay if that's really true

621
00:31:43.025 --> 00:31:46.975
what is that pain I'm feeling, that people experience.

622
00:31:46.975 --> 00:31:48.505
<v Regina>Or, if they've had a heart attack.</v>

623
00:31:48.505 --> 00:31:49.426
<v ->Right.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

624
00:31:49.426 --> 00:31:53.872
<v ->Well, Dr. Kern found out that the pH</v>

625
00:31:53.872 --> 00:31:58.832
was off in the heart muscle at those places and

626
00:31:59.102 --> 00:32:03.319
there was an opening, there was actually a disintegration

627
00:32:03.319 --> 00:32:08.279
in the muscle tissue because of the pH balance.

628
00:32:08.419 --> 00:32:11.087
He discovered there was basically something

629
00:32:11.087 --> 00:32:14.879
called strophanthin, which is a substance in the blood.

630
00:32:14.879 --> 00:32:19.285
He also discovered an African herb that provides

631
00:32:19.285 --> 00:32:24.181
this strophanthin into the body and in less than

632
00:32:24.181 --> 00:32:29.181
10 minutes the pH is balanced in the heart, the person has

633
00:32:29.211 --> 00:32:32.334
no more pain and they could go on with their

634
00:32:32.334 --> 00:32:36.128
occluded arteries and they would have absolutely no problem.

635
00:32:36.128 --> 00:32:37.634
<v Regina>There were studies done on this.</v>

636
00:32:37.634 --> 00:32:39.943
<v ->Oh absolutely they did a controlled study.</v>

637
00:32:39.943 --> 00:32:44.943
20,000 patients in a German study.

638
00:32:45.259 --> 00:32:49.696
Now, there were literally thousands and thousands

639
00:32:49.696 --> 00:32:52.468
of studies that have been done on strophanthin

640
00:32:52.468 --> 00:32:57.039
in foreign languages, because it never made it over here.

641
00:32:57.039 --> 00:33:00.702
And, the shame of this is that once somebody's

642
00:33:00.702 --> 00:33:05.181
on strophanthin, in a 20,000 patient study,

643
00:33:05.181 --> 00:33:09.700
the patients on strophanthin I believe there was one person

644
00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:11.717
that had a further heart attack.

645
00:33:11.717 --> 00:33:15.886
Whereas there were hundreds in the control group.

646
00:33:15.886 --> 00:33:20.185
The biggest study of course was miners underground.

647
00:33:20.185 --> 00:33:23.962
When they have a heart attack, by the time they come up,

648
00:33:23.962 --> 00:33:25.256
they're brought up.
<v Regina>Uh-hu.</v>

649
00:33:25.256 --> 00:33:30.137
<v ->And go there was out of I think something like 100 or 200</v>

650
00:33:30.137 --> 00:33:33.275
miners, there was a high percentage of deaths.

651
00:33:33.275 --> 00:33:37.875
Once strophanthin was placed down in the mine, no miner

652
00:33:37.875 --> 00:33:42.676
ever died of a heart attack because the body is balanced.

653
00:33:42.676 --> 00:33:44.817
(clears throat) The only problem is it's very,

654
00:33:44.817 --> 00:33:49.286
very expensive, it retailed for about $2 a day.

655
00:33:49.286 --> 00:33:50.997
So, it's not a lot of money.
<v Regina>Yeah, compared to</v>

656
00:33:50.997 --> 00:33:53.700
what 100,000 for bypass surgery.

657
00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:57.465
<v ->Absolutely and by the way 95% of people scheduled</v>

658
00:33:57.465 --> 00:34:01.971
for heart bypass did not need it when they have taken

659
00:34:01.971 --> 00:34:05.327
Strophanthin-G, which is this product.

660
00:34:05.327 --> 00:34:09.109
<v Regina>And I would guess that virtually everyone</v>

661
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:11.513
watching this right now knows someone

662
00:34:11.513 --> 00:34:13.646
who's had a heart problem or a history of it,

663
00:34:13.646 --> 00:34:15.502
and probably not one of them has ever been

664
00:34:15.502 --> 00:34:17.542
introduced to this supplement.

665
00:34:17.542 --> 00:34:19.383
<v ->No, because (clears throat) again it's</v>

666
00:34:19.383 --> 00:34:23.745
another one of those items that people just,

667
00:34:23.745 --> 00:34:25.580
where are you gonna read about that?

668
00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.388
It's not gonna come in the medical journals.

669
00:34:28.388 --> 00:34:30.291
<v Regina>In Germany, Drew Spiegel, wasn't there a--</v>

670
00:34:30.291 --> 00:34:31.856
<v ->Well yes in there.
<v Regina>In Germany yeah.</v>

671
00:34:31.856 --> 00:34:35.170
<v ->Well, it was in fact, that brings up a very, very</v>

672
00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:39.943
interesting point, because one of the German doctors

673
00:34:39.943 --> 00:34:43.576
with the Heart Association made a comment

674
00:34:43.576 --> 00:34:47.049
that the strophanthin was dangerous.

675
00:34:47.049 --> 00:34:51.441
That doctor was sued by the strophanthin people.

676
00:34:51.441 --> 00:34:54.810
It went to the highest court in the land, which would be

677
00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:58.962
like our Supreme Court, and the heart doctor lost

678
00:34:58.962 --> 00:35:03.420
and the final result was this, anytime he opens his mouth

679
00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:07.392
in the future and ever made a statement like that again

680
00:35:07.392 --> 00:35:10.666
he would be liable for a financial judgment,

681
00:35:10.666 --> 00:35:13.734
because he could not prove his point and he was lying.

682
00:35:13.734 --> 00:35:14.865
(laughter)

683
00:35:14.865 --> 00:35:17.835
<v Regina>Yay, well good for the German justice system.</v>

684
00:35:17.835 --> 00:35:21.004
<v ->Absolutely, because he could not produce data</v>

685
00:35:21.004 --> 00:35:25.555
backing up his assertion, but the strophanthin people could.

686
00:35:25.555 --> 00:35:28.658
Now, I'm very familiar with this because

687
00:35:28.658 --> 00:35:33.027
my World Research Foundation in Stuttgart was given all

688
00:35:33.027 --> 00:35:36.698
of the thousands of studies that were done on strophanthin.

689
00:35:36.698 --> 00:35:39.903
So, we're very, very familiar with that.

690
00:35:39.903 --> 00:35:41.563
<v Regina>Is that supplement available</v>

691
00:35:41.563 --> 00:35:43.901
in the United States?
<v Steven>No, no, no.</v>

692
00:35:43.901 --> 00:35:46.830
<v Regina>Okay, if people are hearing this and saying</v>

693
00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:48.778
I'm going to do something about this,

694
00:35:48.778 --> 00:35:50.313
how do you do that?
<v Steven>They need to travel</v>

695
00:35:50.313 --> 00:35:51.208
to Europe.
<v Regina>You have to go</v>

696
00:35:51.208 --> 00:35:52.206
to Europe to get it?

697
00:35:52.206 --> 00:35:54.130
<v ->You have to travel to Germany, absolutely.</v>

698
00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:57.785
Now, the strophanthin company's under pressure

699
00:35:57.785 --> 00:36:00.421
this last year, even though it's been around a long time

700
00:36:00.421 --> 00:36:03.450
and my staff people in my German office

701
00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:06.460
have used this product and are very, very familiar,

702
00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.861
but pressure has been coming from the pharmaceutical

703
00:36:08.861 --> 00:36:11.648
industry against the strophanthin company

704
00:36:11.648 --> 00:36:14.123
to put them out of business, so.

705
00:36:14.123 --> 00:36:15.694
<v Regina>But, a lot of doctors are still using it</v>

706
00:36:15.694 --> 00:36:16.459
in Germany.
<v Steven>Oh absolutely.</v>

707
00:36:16.459 --> 00:36:18.742
<v Regina>So, it's a highly unlikely the pharmaceutical</v>

708
00:36:18.742 --> 00:36:20.136
people will win this one.

709
00:36:20.136 --> 00:36:24.006
<v ->I believe, I put in my book that a survey was sent out</v>

710
00:36:24.006 --> 00:36:28.649
to thousands of doctors who had used strophanthin

711
00:36:28.649 --> 00:36:33.579
for more than 10 years and there was not one negative

712
00:36:34.129 --> 00:36:36.248
letter back from those doctors.

713
00:36:36.248 --> 00:36:37.416
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>
<v ->And, by the way</v>

714
00:36:37.416 --> 00:36:40.761
somebody tried to commit suicide taking strophanthin,

715
00:36:40.761 --> 00:36:44.122
one person and they took something like 100 strophanthin

716
00:36:44.122 --> 00:36:47.465
pills at one time and they ended up with an upset stomach.

717
00:36:47.465 --> 00:36:49.398
<v Regina>Okay, (laughs) well.</v>

718
00:36:49.398 --> 00:36:51.067
<v ->Very bad, it's very bad.
<v Regina>Very bad.</v>

719
00:36:51.067 --> 00:36:52.841
Very bad, made the news I'm sure.

720
00:36:52.841 --> 00:36:55.359
Okay, well I wanna get back to this, I mean do you

721
00:36:55.359 --> 00:36:58.662
have to get it under a doctor's prescription in Germany?

722
00:36:58.662 --> 00:37:01.378
<v ->In Germany, yes it's not over the counter,</v>

723
00:37:01.378 --> 00:37:04.184
but if you go to the doctors who are doing it,

724
00:37:04.184 --> 00:37:08.224
there's not a problem, because there is a list of doctors

725
00:37:08.224 --> 00:37:11.219
who would be using the strophanthin.

726
00:37:11.219 --> 00:37:12.888
<v Regina>So, you have to, if you're facing</v>

727
00:37:12.888 --> 00:37:15.693
a potential bypass and this is something

728
00:37:15.693 --> 00:37:18.758
that's been tossed out there by your doctor.

729
00:37:18.758 --> 00:37:20.900
First of all, you would have to travel a good distance.

730
00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:24.965
It could be stressful, but it would, is it,

731
00:37:24.965 --> 00:37:28.168
yeah, I mean okay, we can't talk about that, alright.

732
00:37:28.168 --> 00:37:30.240
Anyway, I'm just tossing it out there.

733
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.015
<v ->Maybe you wanna start a travel agency.</v>

734
00:37:32.015 --> 00:37:32.740
(laughter)

735
00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.715
The Strophanthin Travel.

736
00:37:34.715 --> 00:37:36.216
<v Regina>Maybe you can do that Steven.</v>

737
00:37:36.216 --> 00:37:40.382
<v ->Maybe, so I can lose more hair.</v>

738
00:37:40.382 --> 00:37:45.027
<v Regina>Again, another story where it's almost</v>

739
00:37:45.027 --> 00:37:47.420
criminal in it's proportions that that information

740
00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.856
and that product is withheld
<v Steven>But, you know what</v>

741
00:37:48.856 --> 00:37:49.696
I like about this?
<v Regina>from people</v>

742
00:37:49.696 --> 00:37:51.156
who need it.
<v Steven>It just popped</v>

743
00:37:51.156 --> 00:37:55.135
in here and so, we pop together and do our thing.

744
00:37:55.135 --> 00:38:00.135
He, Dr. Kern was doing his diagnosis, his examination

745
00:38:01.504 --> 00:38:04.139
and everyone in the book, and of course

746
00:38:04.139 --> 00:38:07.612
everyone who ever makes a great discovery is an observer.

747
00:38:07.612 --> 00:38:10.712
They observe what is going on and he's sitting there going,

748
00:38:10.712 --> 00:38:13.587
wait a minute there's something radically wrong if

749
00:38:13.587 --> 00:38:18.053
young soldier, young, young, young has all these occlusions.

750
00:38:18.053 --> 00:38:21.624
Royal Rife says, why did they say the theoretical limition

751
00:38:21.624 --> 00:38:23.793
for a light source has to be this?

752
00:38:23.793 --> 00:38:26.755
George Crile says, wait a minute, I'm not gonna blow it off

753
00:38:26.755 --> 00:38:30.859
because they say this is an aberration my friend died with

754
00:38:30.859 --> 00:38:34.208
really shouldn't have died because there was

755
00:38:34.208 --> 00:38:36.711
very little blood loss going on.

756
00:38:36.711 --> 00:38:40.917
Every person, going back to ancient times, all the great

757
00:38:40.917 --> 00:38:44.411
discoveries came because somebody refused to accept

758
00:38:44.411 --> 00:38:48.056
the status quo or some expert's comment

759
00:38:48.056 --> 00:38:52.385
and proceeded to find out why.

760
00:38:52.385 --> 00:38:53.864
<v Regina>Natural curiosity.</v>

761
00:38:53.864 --> 00:38:56.140
<v ->That is what we have.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

762
00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:57.696
And original thinking.
<v Steven>And your</v>

763
00:38:57.696 --> 00:39:01.164
listeners, your viewers, more your viewers

764
00:39:01.164 --> 00:39:03.227
should really say the same thing.

765
00:39:03.227 --> 00:39:05.766
They should start questioning more.

766
00:39:05.766 --> 00:39:09.373
You know, recently I made a presentation

767
00:39:09.373 --> 00:39:12.005
and I was trying to empower the audience to say,

768
00:39:12.005 --> 00:39:15.079
wait a minute, why are you listening to somebody

769
00:39:15.079 --> 00:39:17.873
who's telling you that something is right or wrong,

770
00:39:17.873 --> 00:39:20.521
when they're not healthy themselves?

771
00:39:20.521 --> 00:39:21.442
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

772
00:39:21.442 --> 00:39:24.221
<v ->If a doctor has all the answers, 90% of the doctors</v>

773
00:39:24.221 --> 00:39:27.091
I've been meeting, they're not in a very healthy state,

774
00:39:27.091 --> 00:39:29.999
but they're telling you that vitamins aren't good,

775
00:39:29.999 --> 00:39:33.267
nutrition isn't important, take these chemicals,

776
00:39:33.267 --> 00:39:37.027
but when there was a debate in Hamburg, Germany

777
00:39:37.027 --> 00:39:40.003
where 10,000 oncologists met.

778
00:39:40.003 --> 00:39:43.978
Dr. Able did a statistical review of chemotherapy

779
00:39:43.978 --> 00:39:45.835
and radiation and the majority

780
00:39:45.835 --> 00:39:48.413
of those radiologists, you know what they said?

781
00:39:48.413 --> 00:39:51.472
They wouldn't take it if they got cancer.

782
00:39:51.472 --> 00:39:52.221
<v Regina>There you go.</v>

783
00:39:52.221 --> 00:39:53.622
<v ->They wouldn't do their own therapy.</v>

784
00:39:53.622 --> 00:39:55.322
<v Regina>And, I've met a lot of doctors who say the</v>

785
00:39:55.322 --> 00:39:57.393
same thing, they were trained in it and they know,

786
00:39:57.393 --> 00:39:59.319
that's the last thing they'd put in their bodies.

787
00:39:59.319 --> 00:39:59.994
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

788
00:39:59.994 --> 00:40:02.424
<v Regina>So, what are we going to do about this Steven?</v>

789
00:40:02.424 --> 00:40:04.161
I mean yes I can get hopping mad.

790
00:40:04.161 --> 00:40:07.268
Yes, I can try to do something in the media with it,

791
00:40:07.268 --> 00:40:10.069
but what can we all do, what can

792
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:12.038
every person watching this do?

793
00:40:12.038 --> 00:40:13.070
<v ->There's two possibilities.</v>

794
00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:17.532
One is to go from the top down and believe that magically

795
00:40:17.532 --> 00:40:21.215
all the representatives who are being paid by the lobbyists

796
00:40:21.215 --> 00:40:24.887
will have a change of heart and alternative medicine

797
00:40:24.887 --> 00:40:27.455
and the pharmaceutical industry will see the light.

798
00:40:27.455 --> 00:40:32.455
Or, we can go one-by-one do grassroots movements

799
00:40:32.486 --> 00:40:36.787
and that is where I'm really coming from Regina.

800
00:40:36.787 --> 00:40:41.500
You have to go, you have to do it from the grassroots.

801
00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:44.557
You have to really help each person.

802
00:40:44.557 --> 00:40:48.070
What I have done in my life is one person,

803
00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:50.068
the person in front of me, you,

804
00:40:50.068 --> 00:40:52.577
are the most important person in my life.

805
00:40:52.577 --> 00:40:54.644
And, if people will start going

806
00:40:54.644 --> 00:40:57.214
and telling somebody else and sharing.

807
00:40:57.214 --> 00:41:00.281
I believe that's the only way it's gonna change.

808
00:41:00.281 --> 00:41:05.054
It is not going to change from the top down right now,

809
00:41:05.054 --> 00:41:10.028
because it is too powerful, but people need to question.

810
00:41:10.028 --> 00:41:12.993
People need to ask and if you really care about yourself

811
00:41:12.993 --> 00:41:16.738
or loved ones, you do and you go where you need to go.

812
00:41:16.738 --> 00:41:21.374
<v Regina>And, World Research Foundation, that's wrf.org?</v>

813
00:41:21.374 --> 00:41:24.075
<v Steven>wrf.org, uh-hu.</v>

814
00:41:24.075 --> 00:41:26.474
<v Regina>So, World Research Foundation can really help</v>

815
00:41:26.474 --> 00:41:29.814
guide people to some of the people, both, you know,

816
00:41:29.814 --> 00:41:31.948
in this country, domestically and in other countries.

817
00:41:31.948 --> 00:41:32.757
<v ->All over the world.
<v Regina>We have people</v>

818
00:41:32.757 --> 00:41:33.987
watching from all over the world.

819
00:41:33.987 --> 00:41:36.357
<v ->All over the world.
<v Regina>You have access to</v>

820
00:41:36.357 --> 00:41:40.149
articles and resources from all end to end technologies

821
00:41:40.149 --> 00:41:41.553
that are available all over the world.

822
00:41:41.553 --> 00:41:44.149
<v ->25 years World Research has been around, I've been</v>

823
00:41:44.149 --> 00:41:48.469
doing this 40 years, the idea is we provide options.

824
00:41:48.469 --> 00:41:51.308
We don't endorse, we're not pushing anything.

825
00:41:51.308 --> 00:41:54.072
We are letting people know what their options are.

826
00:41:54.072 --> 00:41:57.706
Or, we're like a chef who's laying out a buffet.

827
00:41:57.706 --> 00:42:01.135
Our job is to keep finding more dishes for that buffet table

828
00:42:01.135 --> 00:42:04.918
that will give you a good solution for your health problem,

829
00:42:04.918 --> 00:42:07.719
but I guarantee anybody listening, I've never joined

830
00:42:07.719 --> 00:42:10.258
anybody's board and we don't endorse,

831
00:42:10.258 --> 00:42:11.946
but we let people know what's out.

832
00:42:11.946 --> 00:42:14.695
<v Regina>Well, all I can say is, like I've said before,</v>

833
00:42:14.695 --> 00:42:17.720
thank you, thank you, thank you, you have been relentless

834
00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:21.098
in your pursuit of the truth about what is working

835
00:42:21.098 --> 00:42:23.968
around this planet and what has been suppressed.

836
00:42:23.968 --> 00:42:26.403
And, I'm very happy you decided to finally put a,

837
00:42:26.403 --> 00:42:28.240
last time I saw you, you hadn't done this book yet.
