00:00:16.434 --> 00:00:18.436
<v ->Nothing has intrigued humankind more than</v>

3
00:00:18.436 --> 00:00:21.340
whether or not we've been visited by extraterrestrials.

4
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.741
In recent times, a flood of accounts have come out

5
00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:26.845
ranging from sightings and contacts to abductions

6
00:00:26.845 --> 00:00:28.947
but few examples are more fascinating

7
00:00:28.947 --> 00:00:32.016
than the unearthing of evidence from our ancient past.

8
00:00:32.016 --> 00:00:35.086
Philip Coppens, author of The Ancient Alien Question,

9
00:00:35.086 --> 00:00:37.121
says that science needs to step up

10
00:00:37.121 --> 00:00:39.858
and begin serious investigation to take this debate

11
00:00:39.858 --> 00:00:41.208
to the forefront.

12
00:00:43.395 --> 00:00:45.130
Hi, Philip. Thank you so much for joining us.

13
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.931
I know you're in the middle of a move

14
00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:49.501
and you're a busy guy and part of that has to be

15
00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:52.403
because of the Ancient Aliens series, which has

16
00:00:52.403 --> 00:00:54.973
really brought a lot of people who were considered

17
00:00:54.973 --> 00:00:58.176
to be more alternative science and alternative history

18
00:00:58.176 --> 00:01:01.379
into the foreground of mainstream because it's

19
00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.015
been such an incredibly popular television series.

20
00:01:04.015 --> 00:01:07.419
Can you talk a little bit about what your experience of that

21
00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:11.589
has been and the response by the public at large

22
00:01:11.589 --> 00:01:14.158
to the "Ancient Aliens" series?

23
00:01:14.158 --> 00:01:16.528
<v ->Absolutely, I mean overall the Ancient Aliens series</v>

24
00:01:16.528 --> 00:01:20.131
I think has been a phenomenal success.

25
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:24.602
You know, (audio cuts out) was that in 2009,

26
00:01:24.602 --> 00:01:26.805
the producer of a special called,

27
00:01:26.805 --> 00:01:29.040
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,

28
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.310
wanted to really go further

29
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.678
and he contacted Giorgio Tsoukalos.

30
00:01:33.678 --> 00:01:36.213
And the question he posed to Giorgio was,

31
00:01:36.213 --> 00:01:38.449
what's happening with Erich von Daniken, is he still alive?

32
00:01:38.449 --> 00:01:41.987
And Giorgio basically said like, um, you're kidding right?

33
00:01:41.987 --> 00:01:46.425
And Kevin Burns the owner of Prometheus

34
00:01:46.425 --> 00:01:48.693
basically said, ah, no, why?

35
00:01:48.693 --> 00:01:50.862
He said, well Eric is something kind of like

36
00:01:50.862 --> 00:01:54.699
my spiritual father and so what happened was that a two hour

37
00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:57.335
special was produced, the two hours special became

38
00:01:57.335 --> 00:01:59.471
the most watched and highly rated show

39
00:01:59.471 --> 00:02:01.606
on the History Channel in 2009.

40
00:02:01.606 --> 00:02:04.543
And since season one, two, and three has been

41
00:02:04.543 --> 00:02:08.347
just completed and there's now work going on on season four.

42
00:02:08.347 --> 00:02:10.448
So really what it is showing is that

43
00:02:10.448 --> 00:02:12.049
there's a tremendous appetite.

44
00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.020
And I think one of the things to do with the success

45
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.155
of the show is the fact that it had stopped

46
00:02:17.155 --> 00:02:20.859
going this tit for tat, that really people are

47
00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:24.428
allowed to really say what they want to say.

48
00:02:24.428 --> 00:02:26.631
And that it is up to the reader, I'm sorry the viewer

49
00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:30.701
to decide what they really want to take away from the show.

50
00:02:30.701 --> 00:02:33.038
So many other shows are like point A

51
00:02:33.038 --> 00:02:35.539
and then point B will attack point A.

52
00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:37.675
So that is something which I think is different

53
00:02:37.675 --> 00:02:39.878
and I think it is also contributing factor

54
00:02:39.878 --> 00:02:41.880
to the success of Ancient Aliens.

55
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.549
And I also think it is one of these big questions

56
00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.752
and it is very rare that big questions

57
00:02:46.752 --> 00:02:49.153
get asked on television.

58
00:02:49.153 --> 00:02:51.122
At the time it's what Kim Kardashian's

59
00:02:51.122 --> 00:02:53.124
hairdo will looked like the following morning

60
00:02:53.124 --> 00:02:55.026
or what is happening in the White House.

61
00:02:55.026 --> 00:02:58.430
But things to do with why are we here, were we alone,

62
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.865
that's really rarely the subject of any show

63
00:03:00.865 --> 00:03:02.299
at all on television.

64
00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.069
And I think this is also contributing factor to the success

65
00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.738
of the series because people really get answers

66
00:03:07.738 --> 00:03:11.876
or at least choose the information whereby they can go out

67
00:03:11.876 --> 00:03:14.846
and find the answers for themselves.

68
00:03:14.846 --> 00:03:16.482
<v Regina>I think you're, that was going to be my</v>

69
00:03:16.482 --> 00:03:18.049
followup question, I think you're right on,

70
00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.119
I really am fatigued

71
00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:24.556
with Discovery Channel, History Channel,

72
00:03:24.556 --> 00:03:27.525
and all of these channels that are,

73
00:03:27.525 --> 00:03:30.527
their mission statement anyway is to help us discovery,

74
00:03:30.527 --> 00:03:33.297
you know, greater depth of science, archeology,

75
00:03:33.297 --> 00:03:36.301
humanity and so forth, yeah this tit for tat thing

76
00:03:36.301 --> 00:03:38.269
pulls the whole program down because all you have to do

77
00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.405
is get the head of the say skeptics society to come on

78
00:03:41.405 --> 00:03:43.941
and on a broad array of subjects say, no I don't think so,

79
00:03:43.941 --> 00:03:46.444
there's no proof, nope where's the proof, where's the proof.

80
00:03:46.444 --> 00:03:50.214
And again, it is difficult finding proof, as your book,

81
00:03:50.214 --> 00:03:53.551
which this is really about finding proofs

82
00:03:53.551 --> 00:03:56.587
for the alien question, right, the ancient alien,

83
00:03:56.587 --> 00:03:59.557
the question of ancient alien existence on the planet.

84
00:03:59.557 --> 00:04:01.825
And there comes a point where you have to start looking

85
00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:05.897
at the startling amount of general evidence

86
00:04:05.897 --> 00:04:09.401
in the collective psyche and which is obviously

87
00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:11.369
made it's way to the surface of our consciousness

88
00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:13.605
or this would not be such a popular show.

89
00:04:13.605 --> 00:04:16.741
And it really makes obsolete the tit for tat you're

90
00:04:16.741 --> 00:04:19.811
talking about and I enjoy watching it for the same reasons.

91
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:21.679
So I'm thrilled that the producer has chosen

92
00:04:21.679 --> 00:04:23.214
to do it this way.

93
00:04:23.214 --> 00:04:25.951
Which is good for all of you.

94
00:04:25.951 --> 00:04:27.953
<v ->Well absolutely and I think, you know, this is one</v>

95
00:04:27.953 --> 00:04:31.489
of the primary things to do with

96
00:04:31.489 --> 00:04:34.392
really what the times we're living in.

97
00:04:34.392 --> 00:04:36.628
So many of these shows have failed in the past

98
00:04:36.628 --> 00:04:39.631
because of this tit for tat approach.

99
00:04:39.631 --> 00:04:42.300
And really the fact that, you know, we are in a position

100
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.735
whereby we can just explore these things.

101
00:04:44.735 --> 00:04:46.171
Some of the skeptics have said,

102
00:04:46.171 --> 00:04:48.406
like well where is the room for us?

103
00:04:48.406 --> 00:04:50.609
The scientists have said, well where is the room for us

104
00:04:50.609 --> 00:04:52.343
in these shows?

105
00:04:52.343 --> 00:04:54.679
And the answer really is that they, you know,

106
00:04:54.679 --> 00:04:57.148
when Zahi Hawass or the other experts

107
00:04:57.148 --> 00:05:00.018
on whatever subject are given

108
00:05:00.018 --> 00:05:02.887
Prime Time Television, they don't invite the Ralph Ellises

109
00:05:02.887 --> 00:05:05.156
or the Lorraine Evans who have different views

110
00:05:05.156 --> 00:05:07.892
around Gauls on ancient Egypt

111
00:05:07.892 --> 00:05:10.494
to give a counterpoint argument either.

112
00:05:10.494 --> 00:05:14.432
So why should they be kind of like on our show so to speak.

113
00:05:14.432 --> 00:05:17.902
So it is a new form of television and I mean yes,

114
00:05:17.902 --> 00:05:20.605
to bring it to the book,

115
00:05:20.605 --> 00:05:23.241
The Ancient Alien Question is specifically there for people

116
00:05:23.241 --> 00:05:26.344
who really wanna delve into this material a bit further.

117
00:05:26.344 --> 00:05:29.046
Because television, obviously, is a visual medium

118
00:05:29.046 --> 00:05:31.917
and visual media only allow for certain things

119
00:05:31.917 --> 00:05:34.452
to be discussed as various visual material.

120
00:05:34.452 --> 00:05:37.321
And so some of these topics are, you know,

121
00:05:37.321 --> 00:05:40.492
not always easy to bring (audio cuts out)

122
00:05:40.492 --> 00:05:42.560
sometimes it is because it is located in areas

123
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.331
where television crews really can't get to.

124
00:05:45.331 --> 00:05:47.666
Sometimes it is because the subject material

125
00:05:47.666 --> 00:05:50.268
really is too hard to bring

126
00:05:50.268 --> 00:05:52.904
in a visual TV kind of setting.

127
00:05:52.904 --> 00:05:56.040
And so the book is pretty much

128
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.777
a synopsis of various things like that.

129
00:05:59.777 --> 00:06:02.781
It's going into depth more about some of the topics

130
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:06.250
discovered or talked about on the series.

131
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.486
It is a companion volume pretty much for everything else.

132
00:06:09.486 --> 00:06:14.391
And it also goes into some material which really

133
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:16.393
I feel is the best evidence.

134
00:06:16.393 --> 00:06:19.130
Like where should be focusing on specifically.

135
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.765
Because we've done about 40 hours of television

136
00:06:21.765 --> 00:06:23.668
with Ancient Aliens and to some extent

137
00:06:23.668 --> 00:06:27.238
it's a very flat medium in the sense that each aspect

138
00:06:27.238 --> 00:06:28.740
is given the same weight.

139
00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.342
But really some aspects, some bits of evidence

140
00:06:31.342 --> 00:06:32.944
are more important than others.

141
00:06:32.944 --> 00:06:35.713
And so I wanna kind of like bring that out more

142
00:06:35.713 --> 00:06:38.116
into the book as well, that there are certain things

143
00:06:38.116 --> 00:06:40.351
where we should really be trying to focus on.

144
00:06:40.351 --> 00:06:42.753
And also I think what I'm actually being

145
00:06:42.753 --> 00:06:46.156
able to do in the book as well is give a reason

146
00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:48.659
as to why we are in the situation where we're in,

147
00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:50.561
in the sense that it's, you know the title of the book

148
00:06:50.561 --> 00:06:51.997
is called The Ancient Alien Question

149
00:06:51.997 --> 00:06:54.031
rather than the ancient alien answer.

150
00:06:54.031 --> 00:06:57.368
Because we are still questioning, we still have questions

151
00:06:57.368 --> 00:06:59.937
and science really needs to engage

152
00:06:59.937 --> 00:07:02.640
in trying to come up with some of the answers

153
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.077
because some of the best evidence, some of the material

154
00:07:05.077 --> 00:07:08.045
we're working with really

155
00:07:08.045 --> 00:07:12.717
has reached, I would say possibility end date

156
00:07:12.717 --> 00:07:17.522
of really going further with just the help of amateurs

157
00:07:17.522 --> 00:07:18.889
or interested parties.

158
00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:22.226
There really needs to be sometimes extraordinarily detailed

159
00:07:22.226 --> 00:07:24.795
DNA analysis going on with certain tribes for example

160
00:07:24.795 --> 00:07:26.331
in China.

161
00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:29.968
And that kind of DNA evidence requires top laboratories

162
00:07:29.968 --> 00:07:32.637
and so that is kind of like the situation we are in.

163
00:07:32.637 --> 00:07:35.106
And it's also what I want to point out to people

164
00:07:35.106 --> 00:07:37.542
as to why some of the skeptics quite often say,

165
00:07:37.542 --> 00:07:39.644
oh well there is really no proof of this.

166
00:07:39.644 --> 00:07:43.314
Well there is a reason why there's no proof of this.

167
00:07:43.314 --> 00:07:45.016
And kind of you know those reasons I said that

168
00:07:45.016 --> 00:07:46.083
in the book as well.

169
00:07:46.083 --> 00:07:48.919
<v Regina>Yeah and very, very good point that you make,</v>

170
00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:51.355
you can't have evidence for it if the scientific community

171
00:07:51.355 --> 00:07:54.960
will not fully participate in the process.

172
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.362
You can have perhaps other kinds of evidence.

173
00:07:58.362 --> 00:08:01.098
And you certainly have spent a tremendous amount of time

174
00:08:01.098 --> 00:08:03.768
detailing the evidence that does exist to this point

175
00:08:03.768 --> 00:08:05.703
and let's launch into some of it.

176
00:08:05.703 --> 00:08:08.238
You bring up quite a few topics,

177
00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:10.442
everything from crystal skulls, and I want you to talk

178
00:08:10.442 --> 00:08:13.278
a little bit about evidence in China that you just mentioned

179
00:08:13.278 --> 00:08:14.879
you alluded to a second ago.

180
00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:18.583
Let's start hop through a few of these hot topics.

181
00:08:18.583 --> 00:08:21.852
<v ->Okay, well the evidence of China obviously</v>

182
00:08:21.852 --> 00:08:24.189
is interesting because there there is a tribe

183
00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:28.125
which in 1962 was identified as being

184
00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:29.527
of extraordinary interest.

185
00:08:29.527 --> 00:08:32.330
Because what had happened was that

186
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.566
bodies had been buried inside a cave

187
00:08:35.566 --> 00:08:37.835
and alongside these bodies were disks

188
00:08:37.835 --> 00:08:39.437
which contained inscriptions.

189
00:08:39.437 --> 00:08:43.174
And in 1962 a Japanese professor who was working in China

190
00:08:43.174 --> 00:08:45.510
was able to decipher these inscriptions.

191
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.413
And his understanding was that these inscriptions

192
00:08:48.413 --> 00:08:51.115
had to do with basically identifying the people

193
00:08:51.115 --> 00:08:52.584
who were buried there.

194
00:08:52.584 --> 00:08:55.786
And they said that these people who were descendants

195
00:08:55.786 --> 00:08:58.522
of pretty much an intermarriage between

196
00:08:58.522 --> 00:09:01.326
extraterrestrials who had crash landed on this planet

197
00:09:01.326 --> 00:09:04.361
a few thousand years before and that had intermarried

198
00:09:04.361 --> 00:09:05.629
with natives.

199
00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:07.866
And the end result was a tribe

200
00:09:07.866 --> 00:09:11.170
of wolfish like creatures,

201
00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:14.371
very round thick skull, inset eyes, there's a photograph

202
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:17.141
of them in the book.

203
00:09:17.141 --> 00:09:19.810
Pretty much these descendants are continued to live

204
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.312
pretty much until the middle of the 20th century.

205
00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:26.683
Now in 1997, China decided that it's one billion people,

206
00:09:26.683 --> 00:09:29.520
or thereabouts needed to have

207
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.757
pretty much a census, they wanted to identify

208
00:09:32.757 --> 00:09:36.026
who was living where and how they related to each other.

209
00:09:36.026 --> 00:09:38.697
And at that moment in time they seemed

210
00:09:38.697 --> 00:09:40.732
to have rediscovered this tribe

211
00:09:40.732 --> 00:09:43.467
because they gave very bizarre descriptions

212
00:09:43.467 --> 00:09:45.737
to some of the people they were encountering.

213
00:09:45.737 --> 00:09:48.606
And it caused some consternation in China as well

214
00:09:48.606 --> 00:09:52.043
because how did these people come to look like this?

215
00:09:52.043 --> 00:09:55.780
And so the Chinese authorities said, well you know,

216
00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.915
these people might have been the result of lead poisoning,

217
00:09:58.915 --> 00:10:02.186
some kind of genetic mutation occurred as a result of this.

218
00:10:02.186 --> 00:10:04.221
And other scientists were basically saying,

219
00:10:04.221 --> 00:10:06.390
well that's impossible, lead poisoning kills,

220
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:10.027
it doesn't cause genetic mutations.

221
00:10:10.027 --> 00:10:12.596
So from what we understand today,

222
00:10:12.596 --> 00:10:15.866
the Chinese government had left it at this situation

223
00:10:15.866 --> 00:10:18.969
whereby there is some dispute as to how these tribes

224
00:10:18.969 --> 00:10:21.305
came to look the way they did.

225
00:10:21.305 --> 00:10:24.176
But at this moment in time, really if you bring in

226
00:10:24.176 --> 00:10:27.645
the archaeological and the legendary evidence

227
00:10:27.645 --> 00:10:29.847
there is an explanation for this.

228
00:10:29.847 --> 00:10:33.451
But to really identify more China needs to open itself more

229
00:10:33.451 --> 00:10:36.354
and also science as a whole needs to open itself more

230
00:10:36.354 --> 00:10:39.456
to finding out whether or not these

231
00:10:39.456 --> 00:10:43.728
beings are indeed of an extraterrestrial intermarriage

232
00:10:43.728 --> 00:10:47.097
as the disks describe, you know, the disks which

233
00:10:47.097 --> 00:10:50.635
have been found with some of these tribes ancestors.

234
00:10:50.635 --> 00:10:54.371
Now crystal skulls obviously is another candidate.

235
00:10:54.371 --> 00:10:56.373
The methodology in making them

236
00:10:56.373 --> 00:10:58.742
means that if we were to do it without any form

237
00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:02.347
of higher technology it would take about 70 years

238
00:11:02.347 --> 00:11:05.182
day-in, day-out of constant working

239
00:11:05.182 --> 00:11:07.718
to create something like the Mitchell-Hedges skull.

240
00:11:07.718 --> 00:11:09.420
And the tiniest of mistakes would

241
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.388
actually destroy the skull.

242
00:11:11.388 --> 00:11:13.491
Because when you look at some of the skulls

243
00:11:13.491 --> 00:11:16.127
like Mitchell-Hedges one, Max, Compassion

244
00:11:16.127 --> 00:11:18.262
is a more recent one which has been discovered,

245
00:11:18.262 --> 00:11:21.999
all of these skulls are carved against the grain.

246
00:11:21.999 --> 00:11:23.634
And you know, just try to cut your,

247
00:11:23.634 --> 00:11:26.838
just try to cut a piece of steak against the grain,

248
00:11:26.838 --> 00:11:29.840
so to speak, and you'll find how much harder it is,

249
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.942
and the same obviously is the case

250
00:11:31.942 --> 00:11:34.179
but 10 fold for working with crystal.

251
00:11:34.179 --> 00:11:37.147
Things like the Mitchell-Hedges skull has a detachable jaw,

252
00:11:37.147 --> 00:11:40.818
which is made from the same quartz crystal as the head.

253
00:11:40.818 --> 00:11:44.054
Basically extraordinarily difficult to do this.

254
00:11:44.054 --> 00:11:46.456
At the same time there are reports that these skulls

255
00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:49.526
allow some kind of communication with an intelligence

256
00:11:49.526 --> 00:11:52.330
which is other-worldly.

257
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.365
And so when you begin to map all of these things,

258
00:11:54.365 --> 00:11:58.170
you really begun to get away from what people

259
00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:59.937
like Jane Walsh from the Smithsonian say,

260
00:11:59.937 --> 00:12:01.173
which is that these skulls have been made

261
00:12:01.173 --> 00:12:05.108
at the end of the 19th century in a village in Germany.

262
00:12:05.108 --> 00:12:08.312
And so really what I'm pointing out in the book

263
00:12:08.312 --> 00:12:12.083
is where they likely came from, which is Central America.

264
00:12:12.083 --> 00:12:14.252
They were probably part of a treasure

265
00:12:14.252 --> 00:12:17.454
which belonged to the Mayans, which was secreted away

266
00:12:17.454 --> 00:12:19.757
when the Spanish conquistadors came.

267
00:12:19.757 --> 00:12:22.893
When it was secreted away, it was protected

268
00:12:22.893 --> 00:12:24.628
by descendants of the Mayan.

269
00:12:24.628 --> 00:12:27.465
And it is my belief and there is evidence for this,

270
00:12:27.465 --> 00:12:30.000
which is too long to go into at this moment in time,

271
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.703
but which is in the book, that Mitchell-Hedges was actually

272
00:12:32.703 --> 00:12:34.605
shown part of this treasure.

273
00:12:34.605 --> 00:12:37.541
Other ancient skulls like Max also probably

274
00:12:37.541 --> 00:12:40.678
came from this or different treasure troves.

275
00:12:40.678 --> 00:12:45.249
And it is also quite apparent that the Mayans used this

276
00:12:45.249 --> 00:12:48.652
to actually allow communication with their gods, who they,

277
00:12:48.652 --> 00:12:53.190
at one point said, had literally walked amongst them.

278
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.161
Other evidence includes the presence of

279
00:12:56.161 --> 00:12:59.397
anomalous radioactive patches in parts of India.

280
00:12:59.397 --> 00:13:02.065
And it is interesting that there is legendary evidence

281
00:13:02.065 --> 00:13:05.803
that the Mahabharata, a tremendous battle which was fought

282
00:13:05.803 --> 00:13:09.173
in the skies between the gods of ancient India

283
00:13:09.173 --> 00:13:10.040
happened there.

284
00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:14.545
Mohenjo Daro and Harappa are two places.

285
00:13:14.545 --> 00:13:17.448
back then part of the Indus Valley Civilization,

286
00:13:17.448 --> 00:13:19.784
roughly 3500 BC.

287
00:13:19.784 --> 00:13:22.452
And when you see there, you literally find people

288
00:13:22.452 --> 00:13:24.888
hand-in-hand, lying in the middle of the street.

289
00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:27.558
Something happened extraordinary quickly.

290
00:13:27.558 --> 00:13:28.959
Now this could have been a volcanic eruption,

291
00:13:28.959 --> 00:13:31.062
something else could have happened.

292
00:13:31.062 --> 00:13:33.898
But there is, at this moment in time,

293
00:13:33.898 --> 00:13:36.800
clearly a picture evolving

294
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.470
that something happened very quickly, very suddenly.

295
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.841
And if Mohenjo Daro or Harappa doesn't to now

296
00:13:43.841 --> 00:13:46.277
to be related to radioactivity, the only thing

297
00:13:46.277 --> 00:13:48.112
what we really think at this moment in time

298
00:13:48.112 --> 00:13:51.215
is that all of these things therefore seem to have happened

299
00:13:51.215 --> 00:13:52.883
even further back in time.

300
00:13:52.883 --> 00:13:55.252
But again, when you're talking about radioactivity

301
00:13:55.252 --> 00:13:58.456
you are required to really get the help

302
00:13:58.456 --> 00:14:01.191
of professional scientists involved

303
00:14:01.191 --> 00:14:05.262
and when it comes to radioactive or testing radioactivity

304
00:14:05.262 --> 00:14:07.731
in Harappa or in Mohenjo Daro,

305
00:14:07.731 --> 00:14:11.168
basically the scientists will say that they know

306
00:14:11.168 --> 00:14:13.871
that our ancestors were not part of a radioactive

307
00:14:13.871 --> 00:14:16.340
nuclear war and that gods don't exists.

308
00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.677
So it's stuck, you don't go further than that.

309
00:14:19.677 --> 00:14:21.211
So you need to have a willingness.

310
00:14:21.211 --> 00:14:25.516
And this is pretty much again, as I hinted at before

311
00:14:25.516 --> 00:14:27.184
where we are so often.

312
00:14:27.184 --> 00:14:29.086
An awful lot of the best evidence really needs

313
00:14:29.086 --> 00:14:32.322
to have the active participation of either governments

314
00:14:32.322 --> 00:14:36.060
and or scientists and logically

315
00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.596
or open attitude of the scientific community

316
00:14:38.596 --> 00:14:41.332
for the evidence to really turn to proof.

317
00:14:41.332 --> 00:14:44.301
<v Regina>Yes and also more respect for the people</v>

318
00:14:44.301 --> 00:14:47.804
such as the indigenous elders and those who are sensitive,

319
00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:51.642
their seers, they understand and can sense energies

320
00:14:51.642 --> 00:14:53.543
and read patterns from the past.

321
00:14:53.543 --> 00:14:56.581
It really seems to me to be a bringing together of the two.

322
00:14:56.581 --> 00:14:59.817
And in fact I was at the 11-11-11 event in Los Angeles

323
00:14:59.817 --> 00:15:02.052
recently and there was someone there

324
00:15:02.052 --> 00:15:05.623
from the Smithsonian, a scientist, a woman.

325
00:15:05.623 --> 00:15:08.459
And interestingly she said, look I'm not representing

326
00:15:08.459 --> 00:15:11.997
the Smithsonian, I'm just a woman who wants to do something

327
00:15:11.997 --> 00:15:13.497
good in the world.

328
00:15:13.497 --> 00:15:17.701
And science has to, essentially, stop the arrogance

329
00:15:17.701 --> 00:15:20.070
in assuming it's the only path to the answers,

330
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:23.407
we have to begin merging knowledge with wisdom.

331
00:15:23.407 --> 00:15:25.542
And I thought, I mean she had

332
00:15:25.542 --> 00:15:27.978
not a standing ovation but a nice round of applause

333
00:15:27.978 --> 00:15:29.980
because everybody there appreciated the fact

334
00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.684
that we do have to begin marrying the two.

335
00:15:32.684 --> 00:15:36.653
And on an energetic level actually, a personal comment,

336
00:15:36.653 --> 00:15:39.589
I had the opportunity to sit with Max,

337
00:15:39.589 --> 00:15:41.726
a number of years ago, the skull Max

338
00:15:41.726 --> 00:15:44.462
for about 15 or 20 minutes by myself.

339
00:15:44.462 --> 00:15:46.864
And just explore and feel the energies in it

340
00:15:46.864 --> 00:15:50.267
and it certainly was not inert by any means.

341
00:15:50.267 --> 00:15:52.101
There was a great amount of energy

342
00:15:52.101 --> 00:15:54.772
which stimulated certain, you know,

343
00:15:54.772 --> 00:15:57.341
interesting thoughts, visions, whatever you wanna call it

344
00:15:57.341 --> 00:15:59.910
in the people that were sitting with it

345
00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.178
at that particular time, as we spoke

346
00:16:02.178 --> 00:16:03.680
about it individually later.

347
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.649
So there was something going on there.

348
00:16:05.649 --> 00:16:08.085
It was projecting some kind of information,

349
00:16:08.085 --> 00:16:09.520
I can say from a personal level,

350
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.421
that was my experience anyway.

351
00:16:11.421 --> 00:16:14.659
One other thing too, you just, go ahead please.

352
00:16:14.659 --> 00:16:17.728
<v ->Well I mean Max is very interesting skull</v>

353
00:16:17.728 --> 00:16:20.296
and he made the cover of my book.

354
00:16:20.296 --> 00:16:22.734
And there's obviously reason why he did so.

355
00:16:22.734 --> 00:16:27.672
But just in Marshal this year in New Mexico,

356
00:16:27.672 --> 00:16:31.274
we spent two days together with Max specifically,

357
00:16:31.274 --> 00:16:35.245
you know, and Joanne, the keeper, protector of Max.

358
00:16:35.245 --> 00:16:38.282
And what was interesting was that because throughout the day

359
00:16:38.282 --> 00:16:40.450
we were pretty much there talking to Joanne,

360
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:43.287
and people came in like you for, you know,

361
00:16:43.287 --> 00:16:45.657
20, 30 hour sessions.

362
00:16:45.657 --> 00:16:49.059
And these people afterwards, you know, just turned around,

363
00:16:49.059 --> 00:16:52.430
chatted a bit, but none of them really made contact

364
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.198
with other people who had gone in

365
00:16:54.198 --> 00:16:56.500
simply because they weren't there to make it

366
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.902
into a gathering, but pretty much just to experience,

367
00:16:58.902 --> 00:17:00.704
have one-on-one time with Max.

368
00:17:00.704 --> 00:17:02.472
And the interesting aspect was this

369
00:17:02.472 --> 00:17:06.527
that everybody who said that Max spoke to them

370
00:17:07.745 --> 00:17:10.113
came away with the same information.

371
00:17:10.113 --> 00:17:12.182
And this wasn't like oh you should love your husband

372
00:17:12.182 --> 00:17:14.384
or your wife or your kids are great

373
00:17:14.384 --> 00:17:15.953
or everything is going to be fine,

374
00:17:15.953 --> 00:17:18.955
this was very specific information.

375
00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:21.891
Quite often from a channel nature in the sense

376
00:17:21.891 --> 00:17:24.562
of like the state of the world, the times we live in,

377
00:17:24.562 --> 00:17:28.799
but also of a kind that really meant that it

378
00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:32.069
wasn't a simple as saying, oh everything will be fine,

379
00:17:32.069 --> 00:17:33.437
the world will be a better place.

380
00:17:33.437 --> 00:17:35.805
None of those things were happening.

381
00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:37.909
And so it kind of was testimony

382
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:39.910
if there was a scientist sitting there,

383
00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:42.212
you could just kinda like see that all of these people

384
00:17:42.212 --> 00:17:46.485
clearly, independently have picked something up from Max,

385
00:17:46.485 --> 00:17:50.887
which was of great interest to them and that Max

386
00:17:50.887 --> 00:17:54.858
really was communicating between each of these individuals.

387
00:17:54.858 --> 00:17:58.461
And I think that is an interesting aspect that you know

388
00:17:58.461 --> 00:18:01.532
that there are these intelligences out there where you can

389
00:18:01.532 --> 00:18:03.800
make contact to and definitely Max

390
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.837
and some of the other crystal skulls are

391
00:18:06.837 --> 00:18:10.809
you know, enablers of getting a different perspective.

392
00:18:10.809 --> 00:18:13.744
I think this is something which is so apparent,

393
00:18:13.744 --> 00:18:17.147
that is that we are so self-absorbed as as society

394
00:18:17.147 --> 00:18:19.483
with our own problems that we sometimes don't

395
00:18:19.483 --> 00:18:22.419
see a way out or that we don't see different perspective.

396
00:18:22.419 --> 00:18:25.222
And to get this perspective from somebody else,

397
00:18:25.222 --> 00:18:27.325
from a non-human intelligence, it's almost like going

398
00:18:27.325 --> 00:18:30.160
to a psychiatrist and laying on the bench and saying,

399
00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.029
oh well, you know, you have this problem

400
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:35.566
but in the larger universal scheme of things,

401
00:18:35.566 --> 00:18:38.236
it's not that big of a deal or here's a way

402
00:18:38.236 --> 00:18:39.903
of transforming this.

403
00:18:39.903 --> 00:18:43.940
And I think if we are beginning to use indigenous

404
00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:48.111
information and if we are beginning to use these approaches

405
00:18:48.111 --> 00:18:52.248
of nonhuman intelligences, I think actually as a society,

406
00:18:52.248 --> 00:18:55.085
we will become more open and also some of the problems

407
00:18:55.085 --> 00:18:58.523
which we are facing will be placed in a better perspective

408
00:18:58.523 --> 00:19:01.158
than some of them which are, you know,

409
00:19:01.158 --> 00:19:03.994
sometimes blown out of complete proportion

410
00:19:03.994 --> 00:19:07.197
and then disappear from the scientific radar

411
00:19:07.197 --> 00:19:10.067
five years afterwards, after they have been

412
00:19:10.067 --> 00:19:13.437
made world famous for whatever they were.

413
00:19:13.437 --> 00:19:16.639
Like you know in the 1970s we turned to a last ice age,

414
00:19:16.639 --> 00:19:18.942
global warming, kind of like is it something which is really

415
00:19:18.942 --> 00:19:21.979
just effecting planet Earth, and if that is the case,

416
00:19:21.979 --> 00:19:24.381
what are we doing with things like the fact that

417
00:19:24.381 --> 00:19:27.951
other planets in our solar system are

418
00:19:27.951 --> 00:19:30.087
subjected to global warming as well?

419
00:19:30.087 --> 00:19:33.890
All of those things really are things whereby there's

420
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:36.126
a mass panic quite often created

421
00:19:36.126 --> 00:19:38.729
and we bend ourselves over backwards

422
00:19:38.729 --> 00:19:40.665
in trying to come up with solutions.

423
00:19:40.665 --> 00:19:43.600
And sometimes, you know, I think that there

424
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.437
is an exaggeration because we are so panic stricken.

425
00:19:46.437 --> 00:19:49.739
And if we do have that outside perspective, we will

426
00:19:49.739 --> 00:19:53.177
get a better view as to where we should focus attention on

427
00:19:53.177 --> 00:19:57.081
and where we can be more calm about our approach

428
00:19:57.081 --> 00:19:58.983
in solving some of these problems.

429
00:19:58.983 --> 00:20:01.017
<v Regina>I agree, and I wanna go back to something</v>

430
00:20:01.017 --> 00:20:04.354
you said just a little bit ago, just before touching

431
00:20:04.354 --> 00:20:06.656
on the crystal skulls and that had to do

432
00:20:06.656 --> 00:20:08.759
with this story in China

433
00:20:08.759 --> 00:20:11.495
and the people wanting to understand,

434
00:20:11.495 --> 00:20:15.433
you know, the origins of themselves.

435
00:20:15.433 --> 00:20:18.535
And this connection again back to the star people

436
00:20:18.535 --> 00:20:21.204
as the Mayans called them.

437
00:20:21.204 --> 00:20:23.674
I interviewed Raymond Tarpey recently,

438
00:20:23.674 --> 00:20:25.809
who had done quite a bit of research

439
00:20:25.809 --> 00:20:28.980
into ancient Chinese and ancient Japanese history.

440
00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:31.381
And he stumbled upon something that required

441
00:20:31.381 --> 00:20:34.318
his going beyond academia, and that was that there

442
00:20:34.318 --> 00:20:37.921
was this direct connection through certain words

443
00:20:37.921 --> 00:20:40.290
and images that were coming up in his research

444
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:44.594
between the ancient Chinese and the ancient Mayans.

445
00:20:44.594 --> 00:20:47.999
And through this, he started going into the Edgar Cayce

446
00:20:47.999 --> 00:20:50.700
readings for example, who was able to validate

447
00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.902
what had happened with the people

448
00:20:52.902 --> 00:20:56.640
and also with the interaction with the extraterrestrial

449
00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.808
civilizations, and then this goes into Tibet,

450
00:20:58.808 --> 00:21:01.578
back to the crystal skulls, so there's a little circle here.

451
00:21:01.578 --> 00:21:04.715
Where after

452
00:21:04.715 --> 00:21:07.685
speaking with a Mayan elder

453
00:21:07.685 --> 00:21:10.187
at the 11-11-11 event, he was telling me

454
00:21:10.187 --> 00:21:13.690
that the Tibetans had given him the crystal skull

455
00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:16.527
and they spoke of a time when those 13 skulls

456
00:21:16.527 --> 00:21:19.463
were delivered, when 13 of them were delivered

457
00:21:19.463 --> 00:21:22.432
to the high mountains of Tibet, to these individuals

458
00:21:22.432 --> 00:21:24.134
and had been kept since.

459
00:21:24.134 --> 00:21:28.506
And it was told at the time that these are to be distributed

460
00:21:28.506 --> 00:21:31.208
appropriately with discernment among other peoples

461
00:21:31.208 --> 00:21:32.409
of the world.

462
00:21:32.409 --> 00:21:36.480
And they describe the people who had dropped them off

463
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.082
as coming in a space craft and being very short

464
00:21:39.082 --> 00:21:41.452
and having blueish, grey kind of skin

465
00:21:41.452 --> 00:21:43.320
and that they actually didn't leave.

466
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.756
They had stayed among the population in Tibet

467
00:21:46.756 --> 00:21:49.460
for, until their death actually.

468
00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.696
And so the legend of those people, or the mythology,

469
00:21:52.696 --> 00:21:56.399
or the historical documentation of them has been passed down

470
00:21:56.399 --> 00:21:57.801
through the monks.

471
00:21:57.801 --> 00:22:02.673
And so that is how the skulls was passed on to the Maya.

472
00:22:02.673 --> 00:22:03.840
In that case.
<v Philip>Well.</v>

473
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.674
<v Regina>Mhmm?</v>

474
00:22:04.674 --> 00:22:07.044
<v ->Well definitely when you look at some of how</v>

475
00:22:07.044 --> 00:22:10.547
these skulls came about, you know, in the West,

476
00:22:10.547 --> 00:22:13.918
there's definitely a very interesting connection there.

477
00:22:13.918 --> 00:22:16.920
Mitchell-Hedges , in the book I explain how Mitchell-Hedges

478
00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.156
gets the skull and pretty much, he is a story

479
00:22:20.156 --> 00:22:23.059
of a wise man who goes to the Mayans

480
00:22:23.059 --> 00:22:26.597
and the Mayans say, you know, you have done so much

481
00:22:26.597 --> 00:22:28.998
for us, take this skull with you.

482
00:22:28.998 --> 00:22:32.635
And for a period of time he had no idea what to do with it

483
00:22:32.635 --> 00:22:34.838
and it's really almost after his death

484
00:22:34.838 --> 00:22:37.174
that Anna Mitchell-Hedges begins to do these things

485
00:22:37.174 --> 00:22:38.541
with the skull.

486
00:22:38.541 --> 00:22:40.744
Max's story's pretty similar as well.

487
00:22:40.744 --> 00:22:45.615
Max was used by a Red Hat Lama in Houston,

488
00:22:45.615 --> 00:22:49.053
living there, you know, and gave it to Joanne

489
00:22:49.053 --> 00:22:51.955
and pretty much it was Max who tells Joanne

490
00:22:51.955 --> 00:22:54.825
to take him out into the big world.

491
00:22:54.825 --> 00:22:57.794
The story of Nick Nocerino I think is typical

492
00:22:57.794 --> 00:23:00.631
of these stories, which is that he was traveling around

493
00:23:00.631 --> 00:23:03.700
in the 1950s in the Mayan heartland

494
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.103
and on a number of occasions he was given crystal skulls.

495
00:23:07.103 --> 00:23:10.706
He refused in most instances because he was convinced

496
00:23:10.706 --> 00:23:13.810
that the locals needed to use these skulls

497
00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.412
for their own benefit.

498
00:23:15.412 --> 00:23:17.714
But there were occasions, obviously one occasion

499
00:23:17.714 --> 00:23:21.017
where he felt that yes, he should bring this skull

500
00:23:21.017 --> 00:23:22.152
to the Western world.

501
00:23:22.152 --> 00:23:24.722
And so you see from the 1950s onwards

502
00:23:24.722 --> 00:23:29.059
very much that people, Westerners who went to the Mayan

503
00:23:29.059 --> 00:23:31.895
heartlands came away with some these crystal skulls,

504
00:23:31.895 --> 00:23:35.065
pretty much as a means of

505
00:23:35.065 --> 00:23:40.065
opening the Western mindset to this kind of thinking.

506
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:43.974
And so yeah the Tibetan connection is something which

507
00:23:43.974 --> 00:23:47.076
definitely is something which, you know, has come across,

508
00:23:47.076 --> 00:23:50.080
as I said Max has a Tibetan connection.

509
00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.784
And, you know, at this moment in time I think we are

510
00:23:53.784 --> 00:23:58.388
not in a complete position to get the total picture

511
00:23:58.388 --> 00:24:01.359
as to where they are coming from.

512
00:24:01.359 --> 00:24:04.962
But definitely, you know, it is clear that from the 1950s

513
00:24:04.962 --> 00:24:07.797
onwards these skulls were sent out, so to speak,

514
00:24:07.797 --> 00:24:11.367
from the Mayan heartlands to the western nations

515
00:24:11.367 --> 00:24:14.504
of this planet to say, look this is what we have.

516
00:24:14.504 --> 00:24:16.673
And I think it is interesting that, you know,

517
00:24:16.673 --> 00:24:19.777
in the run up to 2012, which is all about calendar systems

518
00:24:19.777 --> 00:24:23.614
of the Mayans, that skulls have taken such a prominence.

519
00:24:23.614 --> 00:24:26.816
Because in the early 1990s, there was hardly any book

520
00:24:26.816 --> 00:24:29.052
written about the Mayans and their religion

521
00:24:29.052 --> 00:24:31.788
and their mythology, and since the 1990s,

522
00:24:31.788 --> 00:24:34.758
so much has become, you know, about the Mayans

523
00:24:34.758 --> 00:24:37.860
that they pretty much have overtaken I think ancient Egypt.

524
00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.964
And that is definitely a trend which is of interest

525
00:24:40.964 --> 00:24:43.334
and the rise of public (audio cuts out)

526
00:24:43.334 --> 00:24:45.268
of the crystal skulls definitely has to do with them.

527
00:24:45.268 --> 00:24:47.604
And again, it was Indiana Jones and the Kingdom

528
00:24:47.604 --> 00:24:49.672
of the Crystal Skulls, which was

529
00:24:49.672 --> 00:24:52.842
of primary importance in bringing about Ancient Aliens.

530
00:24:52.842 --> 00:24:54.177
So there you are.

531
00:24:54.177 --> 00:24:56.212
<v Regina>Yeah, and it served its purpose well.</v>

532
00:24:56.212 --> 00:24:58.915
Even if it had a bit of a freight scenario at the end of it,

533
00:24:58.915 --> 00:25:00.416
it did still serve its purpose

534
00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:02.986
to develop the curiosity about it.

535
00:25:02.986 --> 00:25:05.122
And certainly in the Mayan story you can't forget

536
00:25:05.122 --> 00:25:07.724
Jose Arguelles, I think he had a good amount to do

537
00:25:07.724 --> 00:25:09.693
also with bringing this forward and the knowledge

538
00:25:09.693 --> 00:25:13.129
of the calendar and he felt it was his life's purpose

539
00:25:13.129 --> 00:25:15.464
from the age of 14, until his death at what,

540
00:25:15.464 --> 00:25:17.801
he was 71 or 72 last year when he died?

541
00:25:17.801 --> 00:25:19.836
He was over 70.

542
00:25:19.836 --> 00:25:22.371
To bring this knowledge forward to this time

543
00:25:22.371 --> 00:25:23.940
and he succeeded well.

544
00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.908
And I spoke with him about some

545
00:25:25.908 --> 00:25:27.544
interesting anomalies as well.

546
00:25:27.544 --> 00:25:31.182
And I find it fascinating that people like yourself,

547
00:25:31.182 --> 00:25:34.617
everyone, Raymond Tarpey, Jose, and many, many others,

548
00:25:34.617 --> 00:25:36.986
Eric von Daniken and certainly playing his part

549
00:25:36.986 --> 00:25:39.256
for decades now, have,

550
00:25:39.256 --> 00:25:41.626
the information is starting to intersect

551
00:25:41.626 --> 00:25:44.527
and as it's coming out people are talking to each other

552
00:25:44.527 --> 00:25:46.396
and finding that there are these incredible

553
00:25:46.396 --> 00:25:48.565
connecting points between these stories.

554
00:25:48.565 --> 00:25:52.870
Just like I said with the Tibetans and with Humbatz Men

555
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.172
of the Mayans and the crystal skull

556
00:25:55.172 --> 00:25:57.508
coming from Tibet to the Mayan.

557
00:25:57.508 --> 00:25:59.208
Let's talk about a couple of the other things

558
00:25:59.208 --> 00:26:01.545
because as we're on this subject of crystal skulls

559
00:26:01.545 --> 00:26:03.980
and we spoke about the tiny people,

560
00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.282
we can speak about that in reverse, there's certainly

561
00:26:06.282 --> 00:26:09.819
been finding of, all over the planet as a matter of fact,

562
00:26:09.819 --> 00:26:14.590
of anomalous anatomical structures, including giants.

563
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:16.309
And I had the pleasure,

564
00:26:18.361 --> 00:26:20.864
I hadn't expected this, recently while in Vienna

565
00:26:20.864 --> 00:26:23.834
of holding the occipital bone of a human,

566
00:26:23.834 --> 00:26:25.135
what appeared to be a human being

567
00:26:25.135 --> 00:26:27.637
according to anatomists in Austria

568
00:26:27.637 --> 00:26:30.507
of a person who was between 21 and 23 feet tall.

569
00:26:30.507 --> 00:26:33.242
And of course this is kind of life altering.

570
00:26:33.242 --> 00:26:35.579
You can read about it, but when you're seeing the evidence

571
00:26:35.579 --> 00:26:37.681
for it, it kind of grounds it in there.

572
00:26:37.681 --> 00:26:40.484
And you've done some research on this subject as well.

573
00:26:40.484 --> 00:26:43.087
Can you speak a bit to the whole notion of giants

574
00:26:43.087 --> 00:26:44.837
walking the planet as well?

575
00:26:47.323 --> 00:26:50.126
<v ->Yes definitely, I mean the idea of the giants</v>

576
00:26:50.126 --> 00:26:53.129
really goes back I think to the biblical times.

577
00:26:53.129 --> 00:26:56.366
The story of Genesis 6 which the watchers

578
00:26:56.366 --> 00:26:58.701
is the most telling example of this.

579
00:26:58.701 --> 00:27:01.604
It is, you know, it is written down in the Bible

580
00:27:01.604 --> 00:27:05.742
how gigantic creatures came to planet of Earth,

581
00:27:05.742 --> 00:27:10.379
saw the female women, sorry, saw the female humans,

582
00:27:10.379 --> 00:27:13.750
decided to mate with them and offspring which is created

583
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:17.153
is something which they go about it in extraordinary detail.

584
00:27:17.153 --> 00:27:19.656
It is about how these women die in child birth

585
00:27:19.656 --> 00:27:21.758
or that cesarean emergency sections

586
00:27:21.758 --> 00:27:23.893
have to be done on them.

587
00:27:23.893 --> 00:27:26.697
Because what happens is that the skulls of these beings,

588
00:27:26.697 --> 00:27:31.234
the children, are too big to fit through the pelvic

589
00:27:31.234 --> 00:27:35.038
opening for, you know, giving normal childbirth.

590
00:27:35.038 --> 00:27:38.342
And so what is happening there is really something

591
00:27:38.342 --> 00:27:42.011
which is very graphic and doesn't have any morality lesson

592
00:27:42.011 --> 00:27:43.814
into it whatsoever.

593
00:27:43.814 --> 00:27:46.750
I quite often like this about the Bible which is that

594
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:49.852
it is really a collection of stories of anomalous events

595
00:27:49.852 --> 00:27:51.923
which happened to the Jewish people.

596
00:27:51.923 --> 00:27:53.890
And I think in origin they just wanted

597
00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:55.392
to have a collection of this.

598
00:27:55.392 --> 00:27:58.362
It's only later that all of a sudden they feel that all

599
00:27:58.362 --> 00:28:00.396
of this has to have some morality.

600
00:28:00.396 --> 00:28:02.799
And so begin in search of these things and say,

601
00:28:02.799 --> 00:28:04.767
oh well you know this is the morality of this,

602
00:28:04.767 --> 00:28:06.169
this is the morality of that.

603
00:28:06.169 --> 00:28:08.871
But I think in origin the story of the watchers,

604
00:28:08.871 --> 00:28:12.242
of these giant beings descending from heaven

605
00:28:12.242 --> 00:28:15.112
and mating with humans, I think is just that,

606
00:28:15.112 --> 00:28:16.879
it is there is no morality to it,

607
00:28:16.879 --> 00:28:19.483
it is just a story which was recorded.

608
00:28:19.483 --> 00:28:21.718
And yes, you know, giants have been

609
00:28:21.718 --> 00:28:23.453
recorded everywhere.

610
00:28:23.453 --> 00:28:26.356
Lovelock, Nevada is one place where some

611
00:28:26.356 --> 00:28:27.991
of these bones have survived.

612
00:28:27.991 --> 00:28:31.094
And the interesting thing is that this is anomalous evidence

613
00:28:31.094 --> 00:28:34.731
and originally the museums there in Lovelock

614
00:28:34.731 --> 00:28:38.502
had 15, and one of them in Reno had 15 skulls

615
00:28:38.502 --> 00:28:40.169
which were larger.

616
00:28:40.169 --> 00:28:42.705
At this moment in time between three and five survive

617
00:28:42.705 --> 00:28:45.175
and 10 have simply disappeared.

618
00:28:45.175 --> 00:28:47.110
And it is incredible that, you know,

619
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:50.447
some of the best evidence that we were not alone,

620
00:28:50.447 --> 00:28:52.849
that there is weird things happening

621
00:28:52.849 --> 00:28:54.517
between heaven and earth.

622
00:28:54.517 --> 00:28:57.654
Science doesn't seem to have any respect for these things,

623
00:28:57.654 --> 00:29:01.457
they try to hope that over time people will forget about it.

624
00:29:01.457 --> 00:29:04.727
And quite often the evidence disappears away

625
00:29:04.727 --> 00:29:06.896
from the archaeological records.

626
00:29:06.896 --> 00:29:08.998
And I think that is not a coincidence.

627
00:29:08.998 --> 00:29:11.267
I think actually that this is to some extent,

628
00:29:11.267 --> 00:29:13.303
you know, I wouldn't say a conspiracy,

629
00:29:13.303 --> 00:29:16.172
but definitely, you know, that they

630
00:29:16.172 --> 00:29:19.509
invite these things to disappear over time,

631
00:29:19.509 --> 00:29:21.445
that they invite some of these things.

632
00:29:21.445 --> 00:29:23.546
They're always in museums where they're really hard

633
00:29:23.546 --> 00:29:25.815
to access or they're in parts of museums

634
00:29:25.815 --> 00:29:28.084
where, oh we don't know whether we can open it up

635
00:29:28.084 --> 00:29:30.620
for you, those kinds of things.

636
00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.122
But if you wanna see, you know, the gold mask

637
00:29:32.122 --> 00:29:36.693
of Tutankhamun, that's 24/7 available in a museum,

638
00:29:36.693 --> 00:29:38.828
so to speak anywhere in the world.

639
00:29:38.828 --> 00:29:42.533
So there is this thing and I think we need

640
00:29:42.533 --> 00:29:45.302
to really start looking into that,

641
00:29:45.302 --> 00:29:46.969
we need to start looking into these skulls,

642
00:29:46.969 --> 00:29:49.172
we need to start doing the analyses.

643
00:29:49.172 --> 00:29:51.607
And again, this does involve the active cooperation

644
00:29:51.607 --> 00:29:55.178
of scientists or incredible amount of money

645
00:29:55.178 --> 00:29:59.316
so that private people, you know, can do, can just

646
00:29:59.316 --> 00:30:02.319
take these skulls to laboratories and have them tested.

647
00:30:02.319 --> 00:30:05.488
But as soon as a skull pretty much sits

648
00:30:05.488 --> 00:30:07.858
within a museum environment it's pretty much

649
00:30:07.858 --> 00:30:10.961
off hands, nobody can touch it,

650
00:30:10.961 --> 00:30:13.162
you know, unless you are a scientist.

651
00:30:13.162 --> 00:30:17.000
So there are problems related to how to figure out

652
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.870
how to really progress these issues.

653
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:22.572
And to some extent, the skeptics are saying,

654
00:30:22.572 --> 00:30:25.542
well you know, this never progresses anywhere.

655
00:30:25.542 --> 00:30:27.677
Well there is again, there is a reason for this

656
00:30:27.677 --> 00:30:30.479
because it needs the active cooperation.

657
00:30:30.479 --> 00:30:33.649
And, you know, to some extent, I mean I don't know

658
00:30:33.649 --> 00:30:35.351
who the woman was from the Smithsonian

659
00:30:35.351 --> 00:30:36.786
at the crystal skull conference, but I--

660
00:30:36.786 --> 00:30:38.220
<v Regina>I didn't know here name, she was just</v>

661
00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.356
an attendee.

662
00:30:40.356 --> 00:30:43.760
<v ->But, you know, I have seen how three years ago now,</v>

663
00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:47.029
almost four years ago, the crystal skull was tested

664
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:51.534
at the Smithsonian, that this basically everything

665
00:30:51.534 --> 00:30:54.537
that the two, three hours when the skull was there

666
00:30:54.537 --> 00:30:57.707
was tested and there definitely was no sense of openness

667
00:30:57.707 --> 00:31:01.911
at all from the Smithsonian scientists in this testing.

668
00:31:01.911 --> 00:31:04.747
In fact, you know, there is

669
00:31:04.747 --> 00:31:07.383
an agenda there, to basically say,

670
00:31:07.383 --> 00:31:10.087
this is not real, there is a problem here.

671
00:31:10.087 --> 00:31:12.389
And I think this is a problem with science as a whole,

672
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:15.425
I think there is so much material

673
00:31:15.425 --> 00:31:19.229
which they try to explain away rather than just explain.

674
00:31:19.229 --> 00:31:21.698
And I think this is something which needs to change,

675
00:31:21.698 --> 00:31:24.334
hopefully in the near future.

676
00:31:24.334 --> 00:31:26.904
<v Regina>Yes and there was the famous incident</v>

677
00:31:26.904 --> 00:31:29.839
at the turn of the last century,

678
00:31:29.839 --> 00:31:34.244
what 1910, 1909,

679
00:31:34.244 --> 00:31:36.913
where that treasure trove in the Grand Canyon

680
00:31:36.913 --> 00:31:39.115
of Egyptian artifacts was discovered.

681
00:31:39.115 --> 00:31:43.486
And it was reported in the Phoenix Newspaper in some detail.

682
00:31:43.486 --> 00:31:45.955
And of course the story disappeared, though you can still

683
00:31:45.955 --> 00:31:47.657
find it, it's been put up on the net,

684
00:31:47.657 --> 00:31:50.093
you can find the archived story.

685
00:31:50.093 --> 00:31:53.363
But the Smithsonian allegedly came in

686
00:31:53.363 --> 00:31:56.834
and spirited away all of the artifacts

687
00:31:56.834 --> 00:31:58.568
and then killed the story.

688
00:31:58.568 --> 00:32:01.505
And then the question becomes, how did ancient artifacts

689
00:32:01.505 --> 00:32:04.608
from Egypt end up in a very, very remote and inaccessible

690
00:32:04.608 --> 00:32:05.742
place in the Grand Canyon.

691
00:32:05.742 --> 00:32:07.844
Which if you were looking at it logically,

692
00:32:07.844 --> 00:32:10.713
now in my form in logic and perhaps yours,

693
00:32:10.713 --> 00:32:12.949
the only way that can likely happen is if there

694
00:32:12.949 --> 00:32:14.817
was some kind of flying devices.

695
00:32:14.817 --> 00:32:17.187
There were flying devices and it could simply be

696
00:32:17.187 --> 00:32:20.123
flown in to the location, that would make perfect sense.

697
00:32:20.123 --> 00:32:21.704
And there seems to be enough evidence there have

698
00:32:21.704 --> 00:32:24.394
been flying machines around for a good long while,

699
00:32:24.394 --> 00:32:27.363
prior to recent history.

700
00:32:27.363 --> 00:32:30.052
<v ->Well what was happening there, I don't think</v>

701
00:32:30.052 --> 00:32:32.903
that there's necessarily need for flying machines there,

702
00:32:32.903 --> 00:32:35.838
but the Grand Canyon is a very interesting site.

703
00:32:35.838 --> 00:32:40.377
It is a point of creation for the Hopi.

704
00:32:40.377 --> 00:32:43.380
There are still tribes which appear to,

705
00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:47.317
you know, kind of like go there on a pilgrimage route

706
00:32:47.317 --> 00:32:49.986
every year, it is one of those things like

707
00:32:49.986 --> 00:32:52.321
Santiago Compostela for Christians.

708
00:32:52.321 --> 00:32:56.357
Going to this place of creation within the Grand Canyon

709
00:32:56.357 --> 00:32:59.229
of the Hopi people, it is something which they feel

710
00:32:59.229 --> 00:33:00.629
they have to do.

711
00:33:00.629 --> 00:33:02.599
It is related with the creation of this world

712
00:33:02.599 --> 00:33:05.334
that in the book I go about how the Hopi

713
00:33:05.334 --> 00:33:08.037
really have extraordinary creation mythology.

714
00:33:08.037 --> 00:33:11.974
Which goes back to the Ant People, people who

715
00:33:11.974 --> 00:33:14.878
really sheltered them from storms,

716
00:33:14.878 --> 00:33:18.482
from world devastations, from various things like that.

717
00:33:18.482 --> 00:33:21.017
And it is clear that these Ant People are,

718
00:33:21.017 --> 00:33:24.888
you know, to a nonhuman kind of alien like intelligence.

719
00:33:24.888 --> 00:33:28.024
And so to have that location there in the Grand Canyon,

720
00:33:28.024 --> 00:33:31.327
and then to find that there are potentially Egyptian

721
00:33:31.327 --> 00:33:35.298
artifacts secreted away in the immediate surroundings there

722
00:33:35.298 --> 00:33:38.417
is something which I think is of extreme interest.

723
00:33:40.136 --> 00:33:43.473
And yes, you know, the Smithsonian goes in there,

724
00:33:43.473 --> 00:33:45.941
apparently does some things and nothing is every seen

725
00:33:45.941 --> 00:33:47.344
from it again.

726
00:33:47.344 --> 00:33:51.248
I've been contacted after I wrote a story about that

727
00:33:51.248 --> 00:33:54.351
for my website that there are people

728
00:33:54.351 --> 00:33:58.055
apparently there who still know the location of this site

729
00:33:58.055 --> 00:34:00.857
and they basically said that they are never going

730
00:34:00.857 --> 00:34:04.060
to tell this and that it is pretty much

731
00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:07.096
only going to go through family lines.

732
00:34:07.096 --> 00:34:10.400
Because they really feel that if they were to do it

733
00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:15.138
differently, the way the Western scientific establishment

734
00:34:15.138 --> 00:34:19.642
works is that they would either rip it apart,

735
00:34:19.642 --> 00:34:22.445
misinterpret it, or pretty much,

736
00:34:22.445 --> 00:34:24.081
you know, secrete it away somewhere,

737
00:34:24.081 --> 00:34:25.848
never to be seen from again.

738
00:34:25.848 --> 00:34:28.517
And specially what they don't want to see happen

739
00:34:28.517 --> 00:34:30.921
to this site, but I'm pretty sure there are hundreds

740
00:34:30.921 --> 00:34:33.957
of sites elsewhere in the world as well,

741
00:34:33.957 --> 00:34:37.560
is that people don't want to see something

742
00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:42.031
which is very spiritual basically just reduced to

743
00:34:42.031 --> 00:34:45.034
a story about dead people and things which have been found.

744
00:34:45.034 --> 00:34:48.637
And that the absolute importance of why

745
00:34:48.637 --> 00:34:52.041
that place was there, you know, is,

746
00:34:52.041 --> 00:34:54.176
they wanna have a part of that as well.

747
00:34:54.176 --> 00:34:57.613
And if it is indeed Egyptians who came there,

748
00:34:57.613 --> 00:35:00.482
then it is simply the case that in this present scientific

749
00:35:00.482 --> 00:35:04.253
climate this isn't going to be labeled the most

750
00:35:04.253 --> 00:35:06.823
important scientific discovery ever,

751
00:35:06.823 --> 00:35:09.392
but that it is something which is going to be

752
00:35:09.392 --> 00:35:12.128
disputed and explained away by scientists.

753
00:35:12.128 --> 00:35:13.663
<v Regina>Yes and I think I might</v>

754
00:35:13.663 --> 00:35:15.932
have an idea of who you're speaking of,

755
00:35:15.932 --> 00:35:18.401
although I cannot remember his name,

756
00:35:18.401 --> 00:35:20.669
but there is a man that I met a number of years ago.

757
00:35:20.669 --> 00:35:22.571
I'm terrible with names.

758
00:35:22.571 --> 00:35:26.675
Who at an event where he was showing his information

759
00:35:26.675 --> 00:35:29.278
and was speaking about this event as well,

760
00:35:29.278 --> 00:35:32.115
which I had already been aware of, and in addition to that

761
00:35:32.115 --> 00:35:35.318
had a little slideshow for a small group of people

762
00:35:35.318 --> 00:35:37.319
that was showing some of his findings,

763
00:35:37.319 --> 00:35:39.422
including the giants in the southwest.

764
00:35:39.422 --> 00:35:42.457
And there were these redheads that are between

765
00:35:42.457 --> 00:35:46.763
nine and 15 feet tall that there buried into these

766
00:35:46.763 --> 00:35:49.732
clay cylinders in the ground and they still had hair

767
00:35:49.732 --> 00:35:54.204
and skin on them and even some bits of

768
00:35:54.204 --> 00:35:56.573
tattered fabric on their bodies.

769
00:35:56.573 --> 00:35:58.474
Again, flaming red hair,

770
00:35:58.474 --> 00:36:01.011
something totally anomalous to this region.

771
00:36:01.011 --> 00:36:05.382
People averaging around 11, 12 feet tall.

772
00:36:05.382 --> 00:36:08.417
But it turned out I couldn't speak to him,

773
00:36:08.417 --> 00:36:11.654
his life had been threatened and he considered it

774
00:36:11.654 --> 00:36:13.856
for a moment under anonymous conditions

775
00:36:13.856 --> 00:36:15.691
but it's just too dangerous

776
00:36:15.691 --> 00:36:17.793
for people who actually do have this kind of knowledge

777
00:36:17.793 --> 00:36:19.161
to come forward.

778
00:36:19.161 --> 00:36:22.698
Bad things seem to follow them, you know.

779
00:36:22.698 --> 00:36:26.002
<v ->Well, I mean definitely when we are talking about,</v>

780
00:36:26.002 --> 00:36:28.938
you know, some of the people involved with these things,

781
00:36:28.938 --> 00:36:32.708
an awful lot of them are come across these things by chance.

782
00:36:32.708 --> 00:36:36.946
And I always think of the story of

783
00:36:36.946 --> 00:36:39.183
Russel burrows and the Burrows cave

784
00:36:39.183 --> 00:36:41.183
in Illinois.

785
00:36:41.183 --> 00:36:43.919
And basically what you have there is the story of a man

786
00:36:43.919 --> 00:36:47.356
who's a caver, who stumbles upon a cave,

787
00:36:47.356 --> 00:36:51.661
finds that there are pretty much people

788
00:36:51.661 --> 00:36:54.764
inside there with gold and other artifacts.

789
00:36:54.764 --> 00:36:58.234
And to cut a long story short, what it appears

790
00:36:58.234 --> 00:37:01.538
is that there was this Ptolemaic expedition

791
00:37:01.538 --> 00:37:05.174
which was launched from

792
00:37:05.174 --> 00:37:09.378
western Europe by Egypt area, Mediterranean area,

793
00:37:09.378 --> 00:37:12.816
and across the Atlantic to a place where I believe

794
00:37:12.816 --> 00:37:15.985
in 2000 BC there was actually an active communication.

795
00:37:15.985 --> 00:37:18.554
I believe that an awful lot of the copper

796
00:37:18.554 --> 00:37:21.423
which was used in bronze age Europe actually came

797
00:37:21.423 --> 00:37:24.193
from along the North Americas,

798
00:37:24.193 --> 00:37:26.595
something which Gavin Menzies in his book

799
00:37:26.595 --> 00:37:28.598
The Lost Civilization of the Atlantis,

800
00:37:28.598 --> 00:37:31.668
which is currently, you know, a bestseller

801
00:37:31.668 --> 00:37:35.804
in both the UK and the US, is working on.

802
00:37:35.804 --> 00:37:39.041
And pretty much what Russell Burroughs comes up with

803
00:37:39.041 --> 00:37:41.977
is this cave and he had no idea what to do with it.

804
00:37:41.977 --> 00:37:44.447
He contacted the amateurs because he felt that they

805
00:37:44.447 --> 00:37:46.682
were somehow able to help him.

806
00:37:46.682 --> 00:37:49.085
He got frustrated because he believed

807
00:37:49.085 --> 00:37:51.621
that these people were able to help him more,

808
00:37:51.621 --> 00:37:54.490
that he, you know, was hoping

809
00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:56.926
that they really could practically do.

810
00:37:56.926 --> 00:37:59.929
And at the end it turned out to be a completely failure

811
00:37:59.929 --> 00:38:02.364
in the sense that there is actually a possibility

812
00:38:02.364 --> 00:38:04.666
that he just said, okay I've spent five to 10 years

813
00:38:04.666 --> 00:38:08.704
of my life trying to convince the world that what I found

814
00:38:08.704 --> 00:38:11.273
is of interest, I have taken artifacts out.

815
00:38:11.273 --> 00:38:13.276
Nobody seems to believe me

816
00:38:13.276 --> 00:38:15.177
and some of the people involved are trying

817
00:38:15.177 --> 00:38:17.313
to make a quick buck for themselves.

818
00:38:17.313 --> 00:38:20.382
And when you hear this story and it's, you know,

819
00:38:20.382 --> 00:38:23.953
it's more of a pattern rather than a standalone story,

820
00:38:23.953 --> 00:38:27.223
I can complete relate to people who say,

821
00:38:27.223 --> 00:38:29.893
however much important it is what I have found,

822
00:38:29.893 --> 00:38:32.728
I'm only gonna tell my son or my daughter or my nephew

823
00:38:32.728 --> 00:38:34.830
or very few people in my family.

824
00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:39.469
And that once the attitude of society, of science

825
00:38:39.469 --> 00:38:42.172
has changed, then it is up to them

826
00:38:42.172 --> 00:38:45.041
to kind of like come forward and put these stories out

827
00:38:45.041 --> 00:38:46.442
into the big wide world.

828
00:38:46.442 --> 00:38:48.844
Because at this moment in time,

829
00:38:48.844 --> 00:38:50.747
pretty much all we're going to do

830
00:38:50.747 --> 00:38:53.583
is we're going to become the subject of controversy,

831
00:38:53.583 --> 00:38:57.085
and what we have found is not going to matter at all.

832
00:38:57.085 --> 00:38:59.021
And, you know, the messenger is gonna get shot.

833
00:38:59.021 --> 00:39:00.589
And it is quite often what we do,

834
00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:02.692
we love to shoot messengers.

835
00:39:02.692 --> 00:39:04.793
<v Regina>Absolutely and there's another player here</v>

836
00:39:04.793 --> 00:39:07.797
that I think is doing really wonderful work, Klaus Dona

837
00:39:07.797 --> 00:39:10.466
in Austria by bringing together the collections

838
00:39:10.466 --> 00:39:13.336
of these ancient artifacts, these anomalous artifacts.

839
00:39:13.336 --> 00:39:16.439
And he's not drawing conclusions, he's saying,

840
00:39:16.439 --> 00:39:19.008
look at this for yourself, you connect with,

841
00:39:19.008 --> 00:39:21.777
you do the research with and you decide what the place

842
00:39:21.777 --> 00:39:24.247
of these historically and scientifically may be.

843
00:39:24.247 --> 00:39:26.315
But he's done an extraordinary job in the past

844
00:39:26.315 --> 00:39:28.484
and is in the process of doing so again,

845
00:39:28.484 --> 00:39:32.389
of bringing a lot of these ancient artifacts,

846
00:39:32.389 --> 00:39:35.392
skull samples, the elongated skulls and other things

847
00:39:35.392 --> 00:39:37.326
together, including ancient artwork

848
00:39:37.326 --> 00:39:39.595
where they have no idea what the language is,

849
00:39:39.595 --> 00:39:41.530
they don't know the derivation of the substances

850
00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:44.300
they're made out of, they glow from the inside

851
00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:45.233
and all of this.

852
00:39:45.233 --> 00:39:48.204
So the evidence is being brought together.

853
00:39:48.204 --> 00:39:50.405
And I think maybe the dangerous part

854
00:39:50.405 --> 00:39:55.112
is laying claim to exactly who done it so to speak.

855
00:39:55.112 --> 00:39:58.747
<v ->Absolutely, I mean I have never actually with Klaus</v>

856
00:39:58.747 --> 00:40:00.749
because of the last few years I have been

857
00:40:00.749 --> 00:40:03.819
living more in than the US than in Europe,

858
00:40:03.819 --> 00:40:07.691
but I am fortunate that next September in 2012,

859
00:40:07.691 --> 00:40:09.659
Klaus and I will both be speaking

860
00:40:09.659 --> 00:40:12.895
at the Bosnian Pyramid Conference in Sarajevo.

861
00:40:12.895 --> 00:40:17.032
So it will be my first time that I will be able

862
00:40:17.032 --> 00:40:19.368
to meet Klaus and speak to him

863
00:40:19.368 --> 00:40:22.204
and get to, you know, a more familiar territory

864
00:40:22.204 --> 00:40:23.873
with what he's actually been doing.

865
00:40:23.873 --> 00:40:26.942
But yes, you know, I think that the good thing

866
00:40:26.942 --> 00:40:30.913
that is that so much of this material

867
00:40:30.913 --> 00:40:33.348
quite often when somebody finds something,

868
00:40:33.348 --> 00:40:35.984
people find that there is this immediate rush to judgement

869
00:40:35.984 --> 00:40:38.854
of like, we need to be able to find out everything

870
00:40:38.854 --> 00:40:41.357
about this object, we need to be able to say

871
00:40:41.357 --> 00:40:44.393
where it came from, we need to add something to this.

872
00:40:44.393 --> 00:40:47.530
And I quite often think like hold on let's just settle down.

873
00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:49.598
You know, okay we have found an anomalous skull,

874
00:40:49.598 --> 00:40:51.333
okay, it's an anomaly, that's good enough,

875
00:40:51.333 --> 00:40:53.368
let's take it one step at a time.

876
00:40:53.368 --> 00:40:56.839
We do not have to have these rush to judgment things.

877
00:40:56.839 --> 00:40:59.709
People always wanna have the total truth.

878
00:40:59.709 --> 00:41:03.779
And this is the case with the Bosnian Pyramids in Sarajevo.

879
00:41:03.779 --> 00:41:06.048
They have been identified for like three minutes

880
00:41:06.048 --> 00:41:09.151
and they wanted to know, which civilization had built them,

881
00:41:09.151 --> 00:41:11.486
how old they were, and it's like, okay hold on,

882
00:41:11.486 --> 00:41:14.591
this might take five, 10, 15 years

883
00:41:14.591 --> 00:41:16.224
before these answers come.

884
00:41:16.224 --> 00:41:18.427
Let's just take it one step at a time.

885
00:41:18.427 --> 00:41:20.896
And I think that is also something which needs to change,

886
00:41:20.896 --> 00:41:24.666
you know, this attitude to have complete and final answers.

887
00:41:24.666 --> 00:41:28.137
In the book I actually say that of all the ancient alien

888
00:41:28.137 --> 00:41:30.940
theories out there, most of them are wrong

889
00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:34.444
because they are too many theories, they are,

890
00:41:34.444 --> 00:41:37.712
you know, we are not at that moment in stage

891
00:41:37.712 --> 00:41:40.149
right now to say where

892
00:41:40.149 --> 00:41:43.586
the nonhuman intelligences who contacted Earth

893
00:41:43.586 --> 00:41:46.588
came from, the only thing which we can say right now

894
00:41:46.588 --> 00:41:51.360
is that the overwhelming evidence is that they were here,

895
00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.930
that they taught us some of the sciences.

896
00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:56.065
But all the other details as to, you know,

897
00:41:56.065 --> 00:41:58.100
how many civilizations they contacted,

898
00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:00.369
is Viracocha the same as Quetzalcoatl,

899
00:42:00.369 --> 00:42:02.504
all of these things we simply do not know

900
00:42:02.504 --> 00:42:03.973
at this moment in time.

901
00:42:03.973 --> 00:42:08.444
And part of the reasons why we don't have the answers

902
00:42:08.444 --> 00:42:10.880
right now is pretty much because

903
00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.215
there is this constant rush to judgment,

904
00:42:13.215 --> 00:42:16.185
and then we are confronted with a big theory,

905
00:42:16.185 --> 00:42:19.121
and then we realize that the theory has holes in it

906
00:42:19.121 --> 00:42:22.424
and then we have to go back to basics

907
00:42:22.424 --> 00:42:25.661
and see where we have to build the story up from

908
00:42:25.661 --> 00:42:27.262
onwards once again.

909
00:42:27.262 --> 00:42:30.466
And it is, you know, detrimental to really

910
00:42:30.466 --> 00:42:32.167
and making any real progress.

911
00:42:32.167 --> 00:42:34.036
We should take it one step at a time.

912
00:42:34.036 --> 00:42:36.705
And so people like Klaus who just say,

913
00:42:36.705 --> 00:42:41.610
here's the basic things, and don't do rush to judgements.

914
00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:44.112
I think that is the right approach to take.

915
00:42:44.112 --> 00:42:45.847
<v Regina>Otherwise you just get immediate push back</v>

916
00:42:45.847 --> 00:42:48.316
from the scientific community which starts blowing holes

917
00:42:48.316 --> 00:42:51.486
in everything immediately.

918
00:42:51.486 --> 00:42:53.189
So it starts creating and casting doubt

919
00:42:53.189 --> 00:42:56.792
where there doesn't even need to be doubt at that time.

920
00:42:56.792 --> 00:42:58.360
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

921
00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.696
You know, take it one step at a time

922
00:43:00.696 --> 00:43:03.266
and you will be on firmer ground,

923
00:43:03.266 --> 00:43:07.235
you will be making it far more solid.

924
00:43:07.235 --> 00:43:10.606
And I quite often think that conservative attitude

925
00:43:10.606 --> 00:43:13.108
is something good as well.

926
00:43:13.108 --> 00:43:16.679
You know, I always say, okay so we have found these

927
00:43:16.679 --> 00:43:18.813
gigantic, I'll keep using the example

928
00:43:18.813 --> 00:43:22.184
of the Bosnian Pyramids, we have found some of the most

929
00:43:22.184 --> 00:43:26.722
amazing, you know, structures in planet Earth,

930
00:43:26.722 --> 00:43:28.824
that's good enough. (laughing)

931
00:43:28.824 --> 00:43:30.726
You know, which civilization built them

932
00:43:30.726 --> 00:43:32.795
or when precisely they were built,

933
00:43:32.795 --> 00:43:35.131
does it really matter that much?

934
00:43:35.131 --> 00:43:37.866
It doesn't I think, you know, let's focus on the fact

935
00:43:37.866 --> 00:43:39.968
that there are these gigantic pyramids.

936
00:43:39.968 --> 00:43:42.672
And then once we are, you know,

937
00:43:42.672 --> 00:43:45.675
having done more archaeological excavations into them

938
00:43:45.675 --> 00:43:48.977
and when we begin to find out that they actually were

939
00:43:48.977 --> 00:43:52.548
placed in a location

940
00:43:52.548 --> 00:43:55.851
which is part of a, not a lost civilization,

941
00:43:55.851 --> 00:43:58.887
but a largely obscured civilization,

942
00:43:58.887 --> 00:44:02.223
a civilization where very few people are aware of

943
00:44:02.223 --> 00:44:04.661
called Old Europe.

944
00:44:04.661 --> 00:44:08.029
This is kind of like, you know, something which is great.

945
00:44:08.029 --> 00:44:10.766
And so rather than say okay these pyramids

946
00:44:10.766 --> 00:44:13.835
are tens of thousands of years old,

947
00:44:13.835 --> 00:44:16.538
no, let's just, you know, keep it conservative

948
00:44:16.538 --> 00:44:19.541
and you will not get this immediately backlash

949
00:44:19.541 --> 00:44:22.611
from the scientific community.

950
00:44:22.611 --> 00:44:25.214
You know, but also I think the scientific community

951
00:44:25.214 --> 00:44:28.518
needs to realize that this is not always

952
00:44:28.518 --> 00:44:31.219
them who do the big discoveries.

953
00:44:31.219 --> 00:44:34.423
People out there in the field can make discoveries as well.

954
00:44:34.423 --> 00:44:37.726
And the scientific community very much has this attitude

955
00:44:37.726 --> 00:44:40.562
that only they seem to be able to

956
00:44:40.562 --> 00:44:42.832
be able to make archaeological discoveries.

957
00:44:42.832 --> 00:44:44.566
And that is simply not the case.

958
00:44:44.566 --> 00:44:48.537
So it is both sides who really have to work with each other

959
00:44:48.537 --> 00:44:50.740
and realize that they are not both side,

960
00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:52.808
but that everything is about, you know,

961
00:44:52.808 --> 00:44:55.745
expanding our views and trying to coming up with answers

962
00:44:55.745 --> 00:44:57.947
as to where we came from, why we're here,

963
00:44:57.947 --> 00:45:00.349
and all of those other big questions.

964
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:02.684
<v Regina>And if you don't mind going in your own book,</v>

965
00:45:02.684 --> 00:45:05.787
you have so much evidence, people need to read the book

966
00:45:05.787 --> 00:45:09.959
to begin kind of looking through the variety of evidence

967
00:45:09.959 --> 00:45:13.361
you have of some of the discovered artifacts

968
00:45:13.361 --> 00:45:14.763
and such to this point.

969
00:45:14.763 --> 00:45:18.868
But I'll just can on a couple of them for brevity's sake.

970
00:45:18.868 --> 00:45:22.271
And I've always been fascinated with the notion of lifespans

971
00:45:22.271 --> 00:45:24.841
in ancient times, the book of Kings,

972
00:45:24.841 --> 00:45:28.277
also some of the biblical references to age,

973
00:45:28.277 --> 00:45:30.012
the ages of the people in the time.

974
00:45:30.012 --> 00:45:32.581
Can you talk to this for just a moment?

975
00:45:32.581 --> 00:45:33.749
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

976
00:45:33.749 --> 00:45:35.851
Everybody's aware with the fact that Methuselah,

977
00:45:35.851 --> 00:45:38.821
Adam, and all of these other biblical patriarchs

978
00:45:38.821 --> 00:45:42.291
lived for almost a thousand years.

979
00:45:42.291 --> 00:45:45.260
Now I think to some extent there might have been

980
00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:48.830
material in there which is of a astronomical

981
00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:51.834
or an astrological origin, and that basically people

982
00:45:51.834 --> 00:45:54.637
were putting specific dates in there.

983
00:45:54.637 --> 00:45:57.674
But when you start looking into other evidence,

984
00:45:57.674 --> 00:45:59.841
you realize that certain things are,

985
00:45:59.841 --> 00:46:01.709
you know, definitely different.

986
00:46:01.709 --> 00:46:04.746
And specifically what I always go to is

987
00:46:04.746 --> 00:46:07.899
Manetho's list of dynasties.

988
00:46:09.284 --> 00:46:11.820
It's the story about ancient Egypt, it's the fact

989
00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:15.925
that he writes that before dynastic rule began in Egypt,

990
00:46:15.925 --> 00:46:19.895
roughly 3000 BC, that before there were followers of Horace

991
00:46:19.895 --> 00:46:23.866
and before that the gods who lived on this planet itself.

992
00:46:23.866 --> 00:46:27.336
And they are confronted with rules of gods,

993
00:46:27.336 --> 00:46:30.172
of, you know, thousands of years old.

994
00:46:30.172 --> 00:46:33.075
And this thousands of years is definitely something

995
00:46:33.075 --> 00:46:36.712
which you're seeing with the early civilizations.

996
00:46:36.712 --> 00:46:39.981
Again, there is a traditional explanation which says

997
00:46:39.981 --> 00:46:42.785
that all of this has to do with lunar years.

998
00:46:42.785 --> 00:46:45.120
Now that would mean, it's great you know,

999
00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.289
if you apply that then the likes of Adam,

1000
00:46:47.289 --> 00:46:48.957
rather than living a thousand years,

1001
00:46:48.957 --> 00:46:53.061
would have lived 70, 80 years which seems reasonable enough.

1002
00:46:53.061 --> 00:46:56.065
But then you need to start looking at where they logically

1003
00:46:56.065 --> 00:47:00.636
gave birth, at what age they became a father or to them.

1004
00:47:00.636 --> 00:47:03.138
And at that point in time, you're finding that they

1005
00:47:03.138 --> 00:47:05.173
have children at the age of five.

1006
00:47:05.173 --> 00:47:07.576
So that's a big young.

1007
00:47:07.576 --> 00:47:10.313
And so at the very earliest thing which we could say

1008
00:47:10.313 --> 00:47:13.048
was that our ancestors seemed to have been extraordinarily

1009
00:47:13.048 --> 00:47:17.586
sexually premature at the age of five to have, you know,

1010
00:47:17.586 --> 00:47:22.073
be able to give birth to children.

1011
00:47:23.392 --> 00:47:26.428
<v Regina>And the Egyptians were meticulous record keepers.</v>

1012
00:47:26.428 --> 00:47:29.062
We have to honor and respect that.

1013
00:47:29.062 --> 00:47:32.368
<v ->Absolutely and, you know, that is</v>

1014
00:47:32.368 --> 00:47:35.837
why ancient Egypt was the go-to.

1015
00:47:35.837 --> 00:47:38.273
The Greeks, when they needed to know something,

1016
00:47:38.273 --> 00:47:40.610
they went to Egypt and the Egyptians were telling them

1017
00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:41.977
the answers to this.

1018
00:47:41.977 --> 00:47:43.646
So much has lost.

1019
00:47:43.646 --> 00:47:47.616
There was allegedly a book which says the history of mankind

1020
00:47:47.616 --> 00:47:51.086
for the past 100,000 years,

1021
00:47:51.086 --> 00:47:53.589
it's known that this was one of the books which was actually

1022
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:57.126
burned during the burning of the Library of Alexandria.

1023
00:47:57.126 --> 00:48:00.662
So some information has been lost,

1024
00:48:00.662 --> 00:48:04.966
has been destroyed, that it is simply extraordinary.

1025
00:48:04.966 --> 00:48:07.936
The Mayans, we have so little information about the Mayans

1026
00:48:07.936 --> 00:48:10.538
because the Spanish conquistadors burnt all

1027
00:48:10.538 --> 00:48:12.307
of their information.

1028
00:48:12.307 --> 00:48:15.577
We are slowly recovering from that,

1029
00:48:15.577 --> 00:48:18.781
but it's really only through archaeological material

1030
00:48:18.781 --> 00:48:21.283
that we can reconstruct the history of the Mayans

1031
00:48:21.283 --> 00:48:25.520
because the Mayans did commit an awful lot of things

1032
00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:29.492
to books, which were afterwards simply lost.

1033
00:48:29.492 --> 00:48:31.726
You know, the conquistadors said that all of this

1034
00:48:31.726 --> 00:48:33.495
information was from the devil

1035
00:48:33.495 --> 00:48:36.366
and therefore had to be destroyed.

1036
00:48:36.366 --> 00:48:38.968
And this is time and time again what you see,

1037
00:48:38.968 --> 00:48:43.238
that our ancient history has been continuously destroyed

1038
00:48:43.238 --> 00:48:45.808
because so much book burning has happened.

1039
00:48:45.808 --> 00:48:49.511
It was in Medieval times, it was in Alexandria

1040
00:48:49.511 --> 00:48:53.982
in the fourth century AD, but also it happened in China.

1041
00:48:53.982 --> 00:48:57.586
It is not just simply the bailiwick of our,

1042
00:48:57.586 --> 00:49:00.289
you know, Western civilization, it's also something

1043
00:49:00.289 --> 00:49:03.458
which the Chinese did or a Chinese emperor

1044
00:49:03.458 --> 00:49:06.929
in the third century AD, decided that he was

1045
00:49:06.929 --> 00:49:10.598
going to be seen as the origin of all of Chinese culture.

1046
00:49:10.598 --> 00:49:14.268
And guess what, you know, traditional science which says

1047
00:49:14.268 --> 00:49:18.974
that they have to rely on written evidence only,

1048
00:49:18.974 --> 00:49:20.776
but I'd have thought are going to say,

1049
00:49:20.776 --> 00:49:23.379
well that is indeed the starting date of history.

1050
00:49:23.379 --> 00:49:26.315
Because they are unwilling to look at the other

1051
00:49:26.315 --> 00:49:29.484
kind of material which is folkloric, mythological,

1052
00:49:29.484 --> 00:49:30.985
anthropological evidence.

1053
00:49:30.985 --> 00:49:34.256
And I think in all those cases where we are confronted

1054
00:49:34.256 --> 00:49:37.359
with information that massive book burnings

1055
00:49:37.359 --> 00:49:41.764
or information burnings or information destruction

1056
00:49:41.764 --> 00:49:46.001
happened, that we need to allow the mythological

1057
00:49:46.001 --> 00:49:50.705
and legendary information to come into

1058
00:49:50.705 --> 00:49:54.309
the pool of evidence as well because it is

1059
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:58.414
clear that history was rewritten for a purpose.

1060
00:49:58.414 --> 00:50:01.617
But again, historians don't really want to

1061
00:50:01.617 --> 00:50:03.686
or seem to want to do that pretty much

1062
00:50:03.686 --> 00:50:05.987
because there is this drive of us,

1063
00:50:05.987 --> 00:50:08.055
not just from a historical point of view but I think

1064
00:50:08.055 --> 00:50:11.359
as a completely society, that we want to see ourselves

1065
00:50:11.359 --> 00:50:13.828
as the sum of everything.

1066
00:50:13.828 --> 00:50:16.831
And that is simply not the case, we are an intelligent,

1067
00:50:16.831 --> 00:50:18.733
we're an intelligent species but we are also

1068
00:50:18.733 --> 00:50:23.004
at an intelligent moment in our history.

1069
00:50:23.004 --> 00:50:25.774
But I don't think there's the first time that we

1070
00:50:25.774 --> 00:50:27.709
have been this intelligent.

1071
00:50:27.709 --> 00:50:30.246
I think, you know, there have been times in the past

1072
00:50:30.246 --> 00:50:32.815
when pockets of civilization, which is just

1073
00:50:32.815 --> 00:50:35.618
as interesting today.

1074
00:50:35.618 --> 00:50:38.687
<v Regina>Absolutely and you speak about this</v>

1075
00:50:38.687 --> 00:50:43.058
in your book, you're putting forth that

1076
00:50:43.058 --> 00:50:46.194
this information, there's evidence,

1077
00:50:46.194 --> 00:50:49.131
empirical evidence anyway, that this information,

1078
00:50:49.131 --> 00:50:52.034
these ages of intelligence, the incredible technology

1079
00:50:52.034 --> 00:50:53.869
that's been available in the past

1080
00:50:53.869 --> 00:50:57.071
was seeded by another off-planet culture.

1081
00:50:57.071 --> 00:50:59.975
And whether it came from their being physically present

1082
00:50:59.975 --> 00:51:03.512
or from the elder chiefs being able to communicate

1083
00:51:03.512 --> 00:51:06.548
on some other level with them, somehow society

1084
00:51:06.548 --> 00:51:09.284
was inculcated with this knowledge throughout history

1085
00:51:09.284 --> 00:51:11.152
at various pockets all over the world

1086
00:51:11.152 --> 00:51:14.022
and throughout history we have had access to this,

1087
00:51:14.022 --> 00:51:16.224
the information of advanced civilizations

1088
00:51:16.224 --> 00:51:18.727
to bring our own levels of intelligence and knowledge

1089
00:51:18.727 --> 00:51:22.631
and scientific discovery up.

1090
00:51:22.631 --> 00:51:24.766
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1091
00:51:24.766 --> 00:51:27.669
What I see in the

1092
00:51:27.669 --> 00:51:30.639
evidence of whether or not we were alone

1093
00:51:30.639 --> 00:51:33.742
is very different from what I think the standard view is.

1094
00:51:33.742 --> 00:51:36.378
The standard view is pretty much that ET came

1095
00:51:36.378 --> 00:51:39.214
and to some extent seems to have colonized

1096
00:51:39.214 --> 00:51:43.452
or even created mankind as some kind of slave species.

1097
00:51:43.452 --> 00:51:46.655
Zecharia Sitchin's theories come to mind there most often.

1098
00:51:46.655 --> 00:51:50.025
But all the evidence from the various civilizations

1099
00:51:50.025 --> 00:51:52.828
really points out that there was this beautiful harmony,

1100
00:51:52.828 --> 00:51:55.497
this beautiful symbiosis between us

1101
00:51:55.497 --> 00:51:57.165
and the other-worldly intelligences.

1102
00:51:57.165 --> 00:51:58.933
That whenever we had a question,

1103
00:51:58.933 --> 00:52:00.969
we could go to these intelligences

1104
00:52:00.969 --> 00:52:03.238
and they would help us find answers

1105
00:52:03.238 --> 00:52:05.907
or at least steer us in the right direction.

1106
00:52:05.907 --> 00:52:08.044
And that is something which I think is

1107
00:52:08.044 --> 00:52:10.011
of extraordinary importance.

1108
00:52:10.011 --> 00:52:13.214
And as you say, you know, in the book

1109
00:52:13.214 --> 00:52:15.584
what I specifically want to do is I want to take this

1110
00:52:15.584 --> 00:52:19.354
ancient alien material out from the rather

1111
00:52:19.354 --> 00:52:22.657
narrow confines of physical contact.

1112
00:52:22.657 --> 00:52:24.659
Do I believe that there was physical contact

1113
00:52:24.659 --> 00:52:26.795
in the past with the nonhuman intelligences?

1114
00:52:26.795 --> 00:52:29.030
Yes because

1115
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:30.698
it is not simply a question of belief,

1116
00:52:30.698 --> 00:52:33.168
but it is because our ancestors said as such.

1117
00:52:33.168 --> 00:52:36.471
That there was a time when there were nonhuman intelligences

1118
00:52:36.471 --> 00:52:39.007
physically present on planet Earth

1119
00:52:39.007 --> 00:52:43.145
living next to or with some of our ancestors.

1120
00:52:43.145 --> 00:52:45.980
At some moment in times it seems these creatures

1121
00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:48.350
specifically came here, that they knew we were here,

1122
00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:50.652
that they wanted to establish contact.

1123
00:52:50.652 --> 00:52:53.155
At other moment in time it also seems that they

1124
00:52:53.155 --> 00:52:55.991
simply crash landed and they were stuck here

1125
00:52:55.991 --> 00:52:57.159
and that they couldn't return.

1126
00:52:57.159 --> 00:53:00.929
And the story of the Dropper in India, I'm sorry in China

1127
00:53:00.929 --> 00:53:03.365
is definitely an example of this.

1128
00:53:03.365 --> 00:53:05.700
But I also think that there is a pool of evidence

1129
00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:08.570
which suggests that throughout time,

1130
00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:12.106
throughout so many civilizations there was non-physical

1131
00:53:12.106 --> 00:53:14.909
contact with these nonhuman intelligences.

1132
00:53:14.909 --> 00:53:18.847
And I go into the book into some detail as to

1133
00:53:18.847 --> 00:53:22.049
how the likes of Terence McKenna and their experiences

1134
00:53:22.049 --> 00:53:24.453
of meeting these nonhuman intelligences

1135
00:53:24.453 --> 00:53:27.322
on different planes of existence.

1136
00:53:27.322 --> 00:53:30.825
Which happened in the 1970s, you know, '80s and '90s,

1137
00:53:30.825 --> 00:53:33.495
which is happening to some extent to people

1138
00:53:33.495 --> 00:53:35.663
probably right now as we speak.

1139
00:53:35.663 --> 00:53:38.933
That this is, sorry that this is evidence

1140
00:53:38.933 --> 00:53:42.537
of contact with aliens,

1141
00:53:42.537 --> 00:53:45.539
which is just as good and just as solid

1142
00:53:45.539 --> 00:53:49.910
as the physical contact which some of our ancestors had.

1143
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:51.712
And the reason why it is just as solid

1144
00:53:51.712 --> 00:53:55.383
is because in the likes of Terence McKenna

1145
00:53:55.383 --> 00:53:58.353
what we see is that these eight beings

1146
00:53:58.353 --> 00:54:01.323
gave, in this instance Terence,

1147
00:54:01.323 --> 00:54:03.858
very important information.

1148
00:54:03.858 --> 00:54:06.461
In his case to do with the nature of time.

1149
00:54:06.461 --> 00:54:08.197
In the case of Michael Talbot who wrote

1150
00:54:08.197 --> 00:54:11.400
The Holographic Universe into how the universe

1151
00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.435
was basically a hologram.

1152
00:54:13.435 --> 00:54:15.671
And so what we're seeing is that science

1153
00:54:15.671 --> 00:54:18.106
is really becoming enriched from contact

1154
00:54:18.106 --> 00:54:20.308
with these nonhuman intelligences.

1155
00:54:20.308 --> 00:54:23.612
And so whereas you have on the one hand the crystal skulls

1156
00:54:23.612 --> 00:54:27.649
who are very much more a spiritual guide I would say,

1157
00:54:27.649 --> 00:54:29.518
you also find that, well first of all you can

1158
00:54:29.518 --> 00:54:31.986
use the crystal skulls for more of what I would say

1159
00:54:31.986 --> 00:54:35.257
scientific endeavors, but also that the nonhuman

1160
00:54:35.257 --> 00:54:39.560
intelligences are there to give us scientific information.

1161
00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:44.433
And that I think is a very clear indicator of two things.

1162
00:54:44.433 --> 00:54:47.669
One of them that they are, you know, obviously there,

1163
00:54:47.669 --> 00:54:49.872
that they exist, that they are intelligent

1164
00:54:49.872 --> 00:54:51.940
because they gave us all of this information,

1165
00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:54.709
but also that they are willing to work with us,

1166
00:54:54.709 --> 00:54:58.113
that they see this relationship between us and them

1167
00:54:58.113 --> 00:55:01.983
as a symbiosis for the betterment of mankind.

1168
00:55:01.983 --> 00:55:04.315
<v Regina>Yes and also it doesn't,</v>

1169
00:55:04.315 --> 00:55:06.855
it's not necessarily restricted to one or the other.

1170
00:55:06.855 --> 00:55:10.159
You go into Zecharia Sitchin's work to a great degree

1171
00:55:10.159 --> 00:55:11.760
in the book, and again I encourage people

1172
00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:14.763
to pick up the book and start reviewing this for themselves,

1173
00:55:14.763 --> 00:55:17.032
evaluate for yourself on that.

1174
00:55:17.032 --> 00:55:20.885
But also it's certainly conceivable that we've had this,

1175
00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:25.207
these races that have been here

1176
00:55:25.207 --> 00:55:28.409
to essentially help inform us and help guide

1177
00:55:28.409 --> 00:55:30.745
where guidance has been requested all along.

1178
00:55:30.745 --> 00:55:33.382
It's also certainly possible that we've had some exploited

1179
00:55:33.382 --> 00:55:35.917
and interfering species that have shown up too.

1180
00:55:35.917 --> 00:55:38.920
Not a lot different than the human species in that respect.

1181
00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:42.457
So I say I think we need to really question,

1182
00:55:42.457 --> 00:55:44.527
certainly question all of it and you've done

1183
00:55:44.527 --> 00:55:46.611
a beautiful job of research in that.

1184
00:55:48.729 --> 00:55:50.999
Just on the last note you were talking about,

1185
00:55:50.999 --> 00:55:53.368
I've had some experiences on a personal level.

1186
00:55:53.368 --> 00:55:56.737
Years ago I was looking at doing a PBS series

1187
00:55:56.737 --> 00:55:58.306
on this subject.

1188
00:55:58.306 --> 00:56:00.443
I was in the PBS system and had a show

1189
00:56:00.443 --> 00:56:02.744
nationally at that time and so I had access.

1190
00:56:02.744 --> 00:56:05.613
And part of my research began with Steven Greer.

1191
00:56:05.613 --> 00:56:07.715
And I went out in the field with Steven Greer

1192
00:56:07.715 --> 00:56:11.419
and did a little bit, like he has at night,

1193
00:56:11.419 --> 00:56:13.354
you do a little remote viewing beforehand

1194
00:56:13.354 --> 00:56:16.491
and would be shown things and you speak up

1195
00:56:16.491 --> 00:56:19.560
in the darkness of the night.

1196
00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:22.363
And one of the things I found interesting was that

1197
00:56:22.363 --> 00:56:26.734
I was seeing this one particular thing three nights in a row

1198
00:56:26.734 --> 00:56:30.072
an elliptical, blue, semi-transparent spacecraft

1199
00:56:30.072 --> 00:56:33.408
that was sitting on a flat rock at the edge of some crags.

1200
00:56:33.408 --> 00:56:36.311
We hadn't been out to the crags yet.

1201
00:56:36.311 --> 00:56:39.481
But nothing came of it, I thought well that was bogus

1202
00:56:39.481 --> 00:56:41.616
and I was a little embarrassed, I though thank god it's dark

1203
00:56:41.616 --> 00:56:43.484
and no one can see who said it.

1204
00:56:43.484 --> 00:56:45.486
And then the final day, someone comes in excitedly

1205
00:56:45.486 --> 00:56:46.688
with photographs.

1206
00:56:46.688 --> 00:56:49.424
The day before we had actually done an outing to the crags.

1207
00:56:49.424 --> 00:56:51.927
And exactly as I had been shown repeatedly

1208
00:56:51.927 --> 00:56:54.129
the first three nights of the week out there

1209
00:56:54.129 --> 00:56:56.899
was this semi-transparent, elliptical, blue spacecraft

1210
00:56:56.899 --> 00:56:59.667
sitting on a flat rock right at the edge of the crags.

1211
00:56:59.667 --> 00:57:01.469
They were just taking pictures of the rocks

1212
00:57:01.469 --> 00:57:03.504
and it showed up on digital film,

1213
00:57:03.504 --> 00:57:05.039
where you couldn't see it with your eye.

1214
00:57:05.039 --> 00:57:07.643
And I notice this repeated that they'd say,

1215
00:57:07.643 --> 00:57:10.010
well, you know, I wish we could see a craft overhead,

1216
00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:13.147
but just slightly phased off they were

1217
00:57:13.147 --> 00:57:15.350
out in the field behind us.

1218
00:57:15.350 --> 00:57:18.252
Up at James Gilliland's place, there are beings,

1219
00:57:18.252 --> 00:57:20.188
tall purple beings walking amongst us.

1220
00:57:20.188 --> 00:57:21.890
I happened to mention it to James and he said,

1221
00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:23.959
oh yeah, another lady was talking about them too.

1222
00:57:23.959 --> 00:57:28.163
Because they brought a certain kind of feeling to the group

1223
00:57:28.163 --> 00:57:31.432
that allowed you to absorb information more quickly.

1224
00:57:31.432 --> 00:57:33.635
And I just see them out of the corner of my eye

1225
00:57:33.635 --> 00:57:35.804
walking by.

1226
00:57:35.804 --> 00:57:38.372
And I found it just so interesting that as we

1227
00:57:38.372 --> 00:57:41.642
talk about the quantum void versus the quantum plenum,

1228
00:57:41.642 --> 00:57:45.446
when we were looking at this other worldly issue,

1229
00:57:45.446 --> 00:57:47.616
for me anyway and a lot of other people,

1230
00:57:47.616 --> 00:57:51.620
it's around, it's there all the time in the phased off.

1231
00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:54.855
And that part people can very easily access

1232
00:57:54.855 --> 00:57:57.659
and begin downloading information from.

1233
00:57:57.659 --> 00:57:59.360
That's not even counting that they're dimensional,

1234
00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.963
physical ETs that may have been here.

1235
00:58:01.963 --> 00:58:04.833
<v ->Abslutely, I think, you know, the quest</v>

1236
00:58:04.833 --> 00:58:08.603
of contact with alien intelligences,

1237
00:58:08.603 --> 00:58:11.339
of guided us, of bring about certain things

1238
00:58:11.339 --> 00:58:14.008
is something which is ongoing.

1239
00:58:14.008 --> 00:58:17.178
And to a large extent the ancient alien question

1240
00:58:17.178 --> 00:58:19.514
is, you know, part and parcel of a larger question,

1241
00:58:19.514 --> 00:58:21.350
which is the alien question.

1242
00:58:21.350 --> 00:58:24.653
But what I hoped to do in the book as well

1243
00:58:24.653 --> 00:58:28.023
was to really say, okay some of the ways of studying

1244
00:58:28.023 --> 00:58:29.858
this material from the past we can do

1245
00:58:29.858 --> 00:58:32.126
through studying the present.

1246
00:58:32.126 --> 00:58:34.495
And I do actually hope that, you know,

1247
00:58:34.495 --> 00:58:37.566
one of the things is like that we look at UFO phenomenon

1248
00:58:37.566 --> 00:58:40.735
quite often through, okay we see things in the sky,

1249
00:58:40.735 --> 00:58:43.972
contact was made, close encounters of a third kind,

1250
00:58:43.972 --> 00:58:45.941
and the abduction experiences.

1251
00:58:45.941 --> 00:58:49.310
But there really isn't, you know, I think the final solution

1252
00:58:49.310 --> 00:58:52.447
has to be that we need to seek them out,

1253
00:58:52.447 --> 00:58:55.784
that we need to be able to make contact with them

1254
00:58:55.784 --> 00:58:58.420
on an almost like daily basis.

1255
00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:02.790
And that there are people working there and helping us

1256
00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:05.160
into making this contact happen on a daily basis.

1257
00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:07.962
And that I think is the final aim of this thing.

1258
00:59:07.962 --> 00:59:10.098
And I think then you're also getting away from

1259
00:59:10.098 --> 00:59:11.833
this yes or no answer.

1260
00:59:11.833 --> 00:59:14.769
A photograph will, you know,

1261
00:59:14.769 --> 00:59:18.239
the question is quite often for like real evidence

1262
00:59:18.239 --> 00:59:19.707
of something.

1263
00:59:19.707 --> 00:59:22.310
Well the photograph will only say, okay this is

1264
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:24.111
something which we can't explain.

1265
00:59:24.111 --> 00:59:26.747
It'll never give a real answer, unless you know,

1266
00:59:26.747 --> 00:59:29.917
the spaceship had in giant letters, we are from Octurus

1267
00:59:29.917 --> 00:59:33.722
written on its alien bumper sticker.

1268
00:59:33.722 --> 00:59:35.557
So we need to come up with a different formula

1269
00:59:35.557 --> 00:59:38.259
whereby we can move this debate forward.

1270
00:59:38.259 --> 00:59:41.395
And what you're describing there is I think exactly

1271
00:59:41.395 --> 00:59:44.832
a way forward and over time this will become I think

1272
00:59:44.832 --> 00:59:48.436
more and more the standard way of validating

1273
00:59:48.436 --> 00:59:52.173
that indeed there are more intelligences around us

1274
00:59:52.173 --> 00:59:54.041
than we think there are.

1275
00:59:54.041 --> 00:59:56.110
<v Regina>Absolutely and Philip I know that you</v>

1276
00:59:56.110 --> 00:59:57.544
have a bit of a sore throat today.

1277
00:59:57.544 --> 01:00:00.515
I wanted to talk to you and continue on because well

1278
01:00:00.515 --> 01:00:03.285
Eric von Daniken is not doing interviews right now,

1279
01:00:03.285 --> 01:00:06.720
you were the editor of his latest book, Odyssey of the Gods.

1280
01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.490
And I don't know how your throats holding out,

1281
01:00:08.490 --> 01:00:10.392
but maybe if we could catch you in a few weeks

1282
01:00:10.392 --> 01:00:11.927
after you're done with your move,

1283
01:00:11.927 --> 01:00:15.497
I would be happy to do that and pick up the conversation

1284
01:00:15.497 --> 01:00:17.432
so that you don't wear yourself out today.

1285
01:00:17.432 --> 01:00:19.601
I know you're really busy.

1286
01:00:19.601 --> 01:00:21.202
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1287
01:00:21.202 --> 01:00:24.839
By all accounts, Eric's book, I think this deserves

1288
01:00:24.839 --> 01:00:27.509
an entire show all by itself.

1289
01:00:27.509 --> 01:00:30.845
Let's absolutely go into the details of Eric's

1290
01:00:30.845 --> 01:00:33.312
Odyssey of the Gods in the near future.

1291
01:00:33.312 --> 01:00:36.150
Because I think what Eric has really been trying to do

1292
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:39.720
with that book is show that there is far more depth

1293
01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.956
to ancient Greece than we know.

1294
01:00:41.956 --> 01:00:44.625
And it once again one of those eye-openers

1295
01:00:44.625 --> 01:00:48.696
as to how, what we think is something,

1296
01:00:48.696 --> 01:00:50.498
is actually something completely different.

1297
01:00:50.498 --> 01:00:53.000
<v Regina>Absolutely and he goes into a great description</v>

1298
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.073
in the book from Greek documents, Plato

1299
01:00:57.073 --> 01:01:00.542
into the nature of what Atlantis may have been like

1300
01:01:00.542 --> 01:01:03.244
among many, many other things, we speak of centaurs

1301
01:01:03.244 --> 01:01:06.614
and hybrid beings of all kinds in this book.

1302
01:01:06.614 --> 01:01:08.383
So I do, I agree with you, I think

1303
01:01:08.383 --> 01:01:09.517
it's worth a separate show.

1304
01:01:09.517 --> 01:01:12.587
So if I may invite you back in two or three weeks

1305
01:01:12.587 --> 01:01:15.423
after you're past your move, how's that sound?

1306
01:01:15.423 --> 01:01:18.959
<v ->Absolutely I think it's a lovely place to</v>

1307
01:01:18.959 --> 01:01:21.496
say that Eric might be the ideal gift for Christmas.

1308
01:01:21.496 --> 01:01:23.063
<v Regina>Very good (laughing) okay.</v>

1309
01:01:23.063 --> 01:01:24.666
Thank you so much for your time Philip.

1310
01:01:24.666 --> 01:01:26.601
I really appreciate it and find it fascinating

1311
01:01:26.601 --> 01:01:28.803
and anybody watching this right now

1312
01:01:28.803 --> 01:01:30.438
they can go to Amazon, right?

1313
01:01:30.438 --> 01:01:32.140
Amazon obviously.

1314
01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:33.674
<v ->My book is available pretty much everywhere</v>

1315
01:01:33.674 --> 01:01:35.843
where books are sold, so Amazon, Barnes and Noble,

1316
01:01:35.843 --> 01:01:38.546
or the physical bookshops of Barnes and Noble

1317
01:01:38.546 --> 01:01:40.615
are all carrying this book.

1318
01:01:40.615 --> 01:01:42.550
<v Regina>The Ancient Alien Question.</v>

1319
01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:43.818
<v ->The Ancient Alien Question.</v>

1320
01:01:43.818 --> 01:01:45.420
<v Regina>And what's your website?</v>

1321
01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:47.355
<v ->My website is philipcoppens.com which is</v>

1322
01:01:47.355 --> 01:01:50.992
P-H-I-L-I-P-C-O double P-E-N-S.

1323
01:01:50.992 --> 01:01:54.062
And if you type my name into Facebook or Twitter

1324
01:01:54.062 --> 01:01:55.930
you will also come to me.

1325
01:01:55.930 --> 01:01:57.465
<v Regina>Very good, thank you so much for your time.</v>

1326
01:01:57.465 --> 01:01:58.966
I hope your throat feels better and good luck

1327
01:01:58.966 --> 01:02:00.468
with your move this weekend.

1328
01:02:00.468 --> 01:02:02.637
And we'll talk in a couple weeks then.

1329
01:02:02.637 --> 01:02:03.304
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1330
01:02:03.304 --> 01:02:04.605
<v Regina>Okay, bye-bye now.</v>

1331
01:02:04.605 --> 01:02:05.540
<v ->Bye-bye.</v>

1332
01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:07.675
(light music)

1333
01:02:07.675 --> 01:02:11.045
<v ->Again, Philip's book is title the Ancient Alien Question.</v>

1334
01:02:11.045 --> 01:02:13.114
We'll be speaking again soon regarding the subject

1335
01:02:13.114 --> 01:02:16.050
of the Odyssey of the Gods by Eric von Daniken.

1336
01:02:16.050 --> 01:02:18.219
Meanwhile the subject of alien presence on Earth

1337
01:02:18.219 --> 01:02:20.654
is not going to go away until it's given a full

1338
01:02:20.654 --> 01:02:22.390
and honest investigation.

1339
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:24.358
In the interim we're left to our own instincts

1340
01:02:24.358 --> 01:02:27.629
and what we personally resonate with to fill in the blanks.

1341
01:02:27.629 --> 01:02:30.231
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1342
01:02:30.231 --> 01:02:31.416
(light music)

1343
01:02:35.897 --> 01:02:37.542
<v Voiceover>Please hang up and try again.</v>
