00:00:00.448 --> 00:00:02.602
<v ->Most of you watching this are aware</v>

2
00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:05.197
that there's a quickening of events happening here on Earth.

3
00:00:05.197 --> 00:00:08.356
In response to this many people are having unexpected

4
00:00:08.356 --> 00:00:10.713
and surprising spiritual awakenings.

5
00:00:10.713 --> 00:00:13.230
One such person is Hazel Courtney.

6
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.861
Hazel, who has also been part of

7
00:00:14.861 --> 00:00:17.295
Dr. Gary Schwartz's afterlife experiments,

8
00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:20.175
underwent a phonemonal process of awakening

9
00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:23.300
in which her ability to reach beyond the physical world

10
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.092
emerged without notice.

11
00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:35.914
Hazel let's begin.

12
00:00:36.934 --> 00:00:40.210
On April 8th 1998

13
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.024
<v ->Yeah</v>

14
00:00:41.024 --> 00:00:42.771
<v Voiceover>when you were doing the fashionable thing,</v>

15
00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:45.047
you were in the bread hall of Harrod's

16
00:00:45.056 --> 00:00:45.772
<v ->Right.</v>

17
00:00:45.772 --> 00:00:47.660
<v Voiceover>and your life changed forever.</v>

18
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.289
<v ->It did.</v>

19
00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:50.294
It was just another day in another week

20
00:00:50.294 --> 00:00:52.086
and I was a busy journalist

21
00:00:52.086 --> 00:00:53.953
working with the Sunday Times in London

22
00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:56.609
and I walked into the bread hall

23
00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:58.699
and there's like a turnstile there

24
00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.398
and as I went to go through the turnstile,

25
00:01:01.398 --> 00:01:03.499
it wouldn't go forward and it wouldn't go back.

26
00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:05.611
And in those few seconds it was like

27
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:08.693
a volcanic eruption had gone off inside of me.

28
00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:12.015
And then as that happened obviously I was very jolted

29
00:01:12.015 --> 00:01:15.114
and I had this incredible pain in my head and my chest

30
00:01:15.114 --> 00:01:18.410
and then all of a sudden the turnstile moved

31
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.423
and I went forward,

32
00:01:19.423 --> 00:01:21.314
but within about four or five seconds

33
00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:24.217
I could hear this incredible voice in my head

34
00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:26.879
that I knew for sure was not coming from me.

35
00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:30.582
And so, obviously I was a bit fearful.

36
00:01:30.582 --> 00:01:32.011
I didn't know what was going on

37
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:35.062
and I thought I better get to the doctor now.

38
00:01:36.422 --> 00:01:39.275
I went outside and my driver was waiting for me.

39
00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:43.909
When you think you only have seconds to live,

40
00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.102
fifteen minutes to get to the doctor seems like

41
00:01:46.102 --> 00:01:47.168
a very long time.

42
00:01:47.168 --> 00:01:49.248
So the doctor was waiting for me.

43
00:01:49.248 --> 00:01:50.554
They slammed me on the floor,

44
00:01:50.554 --> 00:01:53.018
they put all those heart monitors on me

45
00:01:53.018 --> 00:01:55.183
because they thought I'd had a massive heart attack.

46
00:01:55.893 --> 00:01:57.402
But by the time they did that

47
00:01:57.402 --> 00:02:01.700
I was already feeling the doctor's thoughts in my head.

48
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.769
I knew what he was thinking.

49
00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:05.913
So that was a fairly awesome moment,

50
00:02:05.913 --> 00:02:07.311
but I knew then in that second

51
00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:08.942
that there was nothing wrong with my heart.

52
00:02:08.942 --> 00:02:10.265
My heart was perfect.

53
00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:12.537
And so when I started to tell him this

54
00:02:12.537 --> 00:02:14.190
that really freaked the doctor out.

55
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.081
He thought

56
00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:17.886
something is happening to this woman

57
00:02:17.886 --> 00:02:18.761
but I don't know what it is.

58
00:02:18.761 --> 00:02:21.619
So like any British doctor or any British person he said:

59
00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:22.942
"You really ought to go home and rest

60
00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:24.168
and have a cup of tea."

61
00:02:24.168 --> 00:02:26.846
In England that's like the panacea to everything.

62
00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.663
Here I have the keys to the universe

63
00:02:28.663 --> 00:02:30.274
and he's telling me to have a cup of tea.

64
00:02:31.274 --> 00:02:33.618
So this is like the Wednesday before Easter.

65
00:02:34.568 --> 00:02:36.092
And I come home.

66
00:02:36.092 --> 00:02:38.098
My husband's kind of freaking out,

67
00:02:38.098 --> 00:02:39.121
like: " What's going on?"

68
00:02:39.121 --> 00:02:40.380
He couldn't figure out what was wrong.

69
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.521
And then it was like really weird,

70
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:42.817
because I came back here

71
00:02:42.817 --> 00:02:45.772
and I went to use the phone by the side of my bed

72
00:02:45.772 --> 00:02:48.780
and I thought I better ring a girlfriend,

73
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.041
check out- see what's going on.

74
00:02:51.041 --> 00:02:53.089
And the room was full of a mist.

75
00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:54.934
It was like I was half in this world

76
00:02:54.934 --> 00:02:55.958
and half in another.

77
00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:59.126
I could still hear all these voices in my head.

78
00:02:59.126 --> 00:03:02.934
I went to use the phone but my arm went into automatic

79
00:03:02.934 --> 00:03:05.664
and my arm just put the phone back into the cradle.

80
00:03:05.664 --> 00:03:08.021
It was in that second I realized that

81
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.677
I, Hazel was no longer in charge.

82
00:03:10.677 --> 00:03:12.309
Something else had taken over

83
00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.701
So then I thought, well I'll go wash my face.

84
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:17.525
And remember I'd had quite a shock.

85
00:03:18.985 --> 00:03:20.740
The first thing I said to the doctor was...

86
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.997
I gave him messages to my daughter and my husband

87
00:03:22.997 --> 00:03:24.981
cause I thought that I was about to die.

88
00:03:26.931 --> 00:03:27.891
I looked in the mirror

89
00:03:27.891 --> 00:03:30.017
and my eyes were a totally different color.

90
00:03:30.017 --> 00:03:31.606
And I looked like somebody else.

91
00:03:31.606 --> 00:03:33.366
I looked totally different.

92
00:03:33.366 --> 00:03:34.529
I looked really young.

93
00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:35.414
I'm 56.

94
00:03:36.144 --> 00:03:39.296
And I looked fantastic considering what a shock

95
00:03:39.296 --> 00:03:40.598
I'd just gone through.

96
00:03:41.568 --> 00:03:43.166
By the time my husband came home

97
00:03:43.166 --> 00:03:45.510
I told that I'd become something special.

98
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.907
(laughs)

99
00:03:46.907 --> 00:03:48.251
<v Voiceover>So that starts well</v>

100
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:50.811
<v ->Yeah and I said that I was going to be doing things</v>

101
00:03:50.811 --> 00:03:51.915
and he said: "What things?"

102
00:03:51.915 --> 00:03:53.872
And I said I'm going to be a bit like Uri Geller.

103
00:03:53.872 --> 00:03:56.509
I just knew that I would be able to do certain things.

104
00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.161
Anyway, he went down and made a cup of tea.

105
00:03:59.161 --> 00:04:01.187
That's the answer to everything in this world.

106
00:04:01.187 --> 00:04:04.718
And then it started to accelerate really fast.

107
00:04:05.488 --> 00:04:07.768
I love food, as you now know,

108
00:04:07.768 --> 00:04:10.627
but I wasn't being allowed to eat any physical food

109
00:04:10.627 --> 00:04:13.283
and the voices just wouldn't go away

110
00:04:13.283 --> 00:04:16.237
and I started affecting electronic equipment.

111
00:04:16.237 --> 00:04:19.599
Like when he would put the TV on I would look at the TV

112
00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.946
and I could change channels just by looking at it.

113
00:04:21.946 --> 00:04:25.668
So I knew something really really amazing was happening.

114
00:04:25.668 --> 00:04:27.951
So then by about the midnight,

115
00:04:27.951 --> 00:04:30.041
I thought who the hell can I call

116
00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:31.533
because my brain was like cooking

117
00:04:31.533 --> 00:04:32.754
I had all this knowledge.

118
00:04:32.754 --> 00:04:36.434
It was like being plugged into an ultimate computer.

119
00:04:36.434 --> 00:04:38.717
And I rang a friend and he said:

120
00:04:38.717 --> 00:04:41.234
"You're having a bit of a spiritual [something-or-other]."

121
00:04:41.234 --> 00:04:42.887
He said: "Eat sugar now."

122
00:04:42.887 --> 00:04:45.607
And as a health writer I thought: "Sugar? That's unhealthy."

123
00:04:46.172 --> 00:04:47.324
So I ate sugar.

124
00:04:47.324 --> 00:04:49.628
I would have eaten anything if I had thought

125
00:04:49.628 --> 00:04:50.492
I could shut it down.

126
00:04:50.492 --> 00:04:51.612
So anyway, the next day

127
00:04:51.612 --> 00:04:54.940
I kept saying to people: "Look into my eyes

128
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.401
and you'll know who I am."

129
00:04:56.401 --> 00:04:58.417
My eyes were still changing color.

130
00:04:58.417 --> 00:05:00.283
I began levitating.

131
00:05:01.313 --> 00:05:03.770
I still couldn't eat any physical food,

132
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.179
which is so unlike me.

133
00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:07.120
So then it comes to Easter Friday.

134
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.312
We travelled back up North

135
00:05:09.312 --> 00:05:11.349
to where our home was near Birmingham.

136
00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.112
Now Easter is, it was April that year.

137
00:05:15.042 --> 00:05:17.930
And then it starts snowing.

138
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.408
Like there's this unbelievable weather around us.

139
00:05:21.408 --> 00:05:25.526
And they said the worst storms were centred on Birmingham

140
00:05:25.526 --> 00:05:26.591
where I lived.

141
00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:28.244
And I don't just mean a storm.

142
00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:32.010
I mean a huge storm, that people were killed

143
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.284
and the snow came as far South as London.

144
00:05:35.284 --> 00:05:39.988
And all the stations outside of London were closed.

145
00:05:39.988 --> 00:05:42.484
So by this time my secretary, who was very spiritual, said:

146
00:05:42.484 --> 00:05:45.587
" Something is happening here Hazel."

147
00:05:45.587 --> 00:05:46.899
And they rang a friend of mine,

148
00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:50.323
and he said: "I think she could be possessed."

149
00:05:50.323 --> 00:05:52.383
And I thought for God's sake
<v Voiceover>This isn't</v>

150
00:05:52.383 --> 00:05:53.267
good news.

151
00:05:53.283 --> 00:05:54.093
<v ->Get real.</v>

152
00:05:54.093 --> 00:05:55.556
I'm a journalist.

153
00:05:55.556 --> 00:05:57.759
We don't do possession here.

154
00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:59.466
I thought what are they talking about?

155
00:05:59.466 --> 00:06:02.698
So by this time I'd lost would you believe it

156
00:06:02.698 --> 00:06:04.788
in two days I'd lost almost a stone,

157
00:06:04.788 --> 00:06:06.719
which I can't really afford to do.

158
00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:08.615
<v Voiceover>Can you explain how much a stone is</v>

159
00:06:08.615 --> 00:06:10.407
for the American audience?
<v ->Oh, 14 lbs.</v>

160
00:06:10.407 --> 00:06:11.676
within two days.

161
00:06:11.676 --> 00:06:13.286
I mean it was incredible.

162
00:06:13.286 --> 00:06:16.027
My eyes were continuing to change color

163
00:06:16.027 --> 00:06:18.651
and then the phenomena started to come on a pace.

164
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:22.732
My secretary, she rang a friend

165
00:06:22.732 --> 00:06:24.364
who's a doctor of theology

166
00:06:24.364 --> 00:06:26.113
and he talked about the possession

167
00:06:26.113 --> 00:06:29.111
and then I had to take to my bed

168
00:06:29.111 --> 00:06:32.139
because by this time I had the most unbelievable fever.

169
00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:34.608
My temperature went up to about 102.

170
00:06:35.845 --> 00:06:38.416
I was visually changing all the time

171
00:06:38.416 --> 00:06:41.515
and there were these voices coming out my mouth

172
00:06:41.516 --> 00:06:43.300
that definitely weren't mine.

173
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.601
But the storm.

174
00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:48.132
I knew that I was attached in some way to the storm.

175
00:06:48.132 --> 00:06:51.145
So then by Good Friday,

176
00:06:51.145 --> 00:06:53.640
I'd rung a doctor friend, a medical doctor

177
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.752
who was a fellow columnist

178
00:06:55.752 --> 00:06:58.589
and he said: "Hazel, I know I have to come and help you".

179
00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:00.264
He said: "Something is happening here"

180
00:07:00.264 --> 00:07:02.134
but he could not get out of London

181
00:07:02.134 --> 00:07:03.266
because the storms were so severe

182
00:07:03.266 --> 00:07:05.696
so he said: "I will come as fast as I can."

183
00:07:05.696 --> 00:07:08.000
By now my husband's really panicking.

184
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.027
He wants to call our local doctor.

185
00:07:10.027 --> 00:07:13.301
For some reason I think he mustn't do this.

186
00:07:13.301 --> 00:07:15.114
I can't see a normal doctor

187
00:07:15.114 --> 00:07:17.002
because a normal doctor won't know what's going on.

188
00:07:17.002 --> 00:07:20.298
I didn't know then that I was having a spiritual emergency.

189
00:07:21.978 --> 00:07:23.125
Come the Friday night,

190
00:07:24.245 --> 00:07:26.613
I'm starting to speak languages I don't speak.

191
00:07:27.353 --> 00:07:28.768
So many things are happening

192
00:07:28.768 --> 00:07:29.866
but I'm in bed because...

193
00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:31.951
I mean I'm freaking out now.

194
00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:34.095
One minute I'm in total terror,

195
00:07:34.095 --> 00:07:35.076
then I'm in bliss

196
00:07:35.076 --> 00:07:35.940
The weather is like...

197
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.084
It was almost like a tornado around us.

198
00:07:38.084 --> 00:07:39.694
Thunder, lightning, snow.

199
00:07:39.694 --> 00:07:42.948
So anyway then at about 12:20

200
00:07:42.948 --> 00:07:44.323
on the Good Friday night

201
00:07:44.323 --> 00:07:46.585
I'm trying to get some sleep

202
00:07:46.585 --> 00:07:48.942
but I'm so soaked with this fever,

203
00:07:48.942 --> 00:07:50.808
I have to get up and go to the bathroom.

204
00:07:50.808 --> 00:07:52.323
My eyes are like emerald green

205
00:07:52.323 --> 00:07:54.738
and my husband said: "What's the matter?"

206
00:07:54.738 --> 00:07:56.728
and I said: "Look, I'm just hot,

207
00:07:56.728 --> 00:07:57.953
maybe I'm menopausal".

208
00:07:57.953 --> 00:07:59.633
You know, men will take anything.

209
00:07:59.633 --> 00:08:01.030
I think it's the menopause.

210
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:02.534
I can laugh now.

211
00:08:04.174 --> 00:08:05.711
I change my nightdress, go back to bed,

212
00:08:05.711 --> 00:08:07.887
and I sleep on my side,

213
00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:09.519
but for some reason by this...

214
00:08:09.519 --> 00:08:11.460
it's about 12:20 on the Friday night,

215
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.510
I'm being turned over and my hands are like this.

216
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.964
And I'm being pushed by something

217
00:08:16.964 --> 00:08:18.062
or somebody else.

218
00:08:18.872 --> 00:08:21.053
Then I closed my eyes so tight

219
00:08:21.053 --> 00:08:23.058
cause I said: "Please make this stop"

220
00:08:23.058 --> 00:08:26.332
and then I knew I was in a coffin in the ground

221
00:08:26.332 --> 00:08:27.868
and I was like freezing to death

222
00:08:27.868 --> 00:08:32.497
and I was seeing like a movie in my mind

223
00:08:32.497 --> 00:08:34.503
and I was sitting in the back of a car

224
00:08:34.503 --> 00:08:39.014
and I was feeling everything that that person

225
00:08:39.014 --> 00:08:41.766
was feeling at the moment of their death

226
00:08:41.766 --> 00:08:42.907
in this crash.

227
00:08:45.147 --> 00:08:47.504
It was a very profound moment

228
00:08:48.314 --> 00:08:51.028
I realized that the voice that I'd been hearing

229
00:08:51.028 --> 00:08:54.420
since that Wednesday was in fact Diana Princess of Wales.

230
00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.542
So, everybody out there please don't start laughing

231
00:08:56.542 --> 00:08:57.412
at this point because...

232
00:08:57.412 --> 00:08:58.370
<v Voiceover>Well not only that.</v>

233
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.346
You also had somewhat of a personal relationship

234
00:09:01.346 --> 00:09:02.722
with Princess Diana

235
00:09:02.722 --> 00:09:04.631
<v ->I mean I'd met her several times</v>

236
00:09:04.631 --> 00:09:06.956
I was never a friend of hers.

237
00:09:06.956 --> 00:09:09.239
We'd had lunch, well we had lunch once

238
00:09:09.239 --> 00:09:10.636
at Kensignton Palace

239
00:09:10.636 --> 00:09:12.214
and we talked about spiritual stuff

240
00:09:12.214 --> 00:09:14.945
and she was really keen on that kind of thing.

241
00:09:15.865 --> 00:09:18.265
We'd had a few other lunches where I'd met her

242
00:09:18.265 --> 00:09:20.241
but I was never a friend of hers.

243
00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:23.566
What had happened was

244
00:09:23.566 --> 00:09:25.198
in the months after she'd died,

245
00:09:25.198 --> 00:09:27.278
quite a few friends who were very psychich

246
00:09:27.278 --> 00:09:29.251
had rung me as a journalist and said:

247
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:32.547
"Hazel you'll never believe who wants to work with you."

248
00:09:32.547 --> 00:09:35.208
And I said like: "Who?"

249
00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:37.230
and they'd say: "We've got messages for you"

250
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.201
"from Princess Diana."

251
00:09:38.201 --> 00:09:39.812
And I'd say: "For God's sake, get real."

252
00:09:39.812 --> 00:09:42.233
"The whole world's got messages from Princess Diana."

253
00:09:42.233 --> 00:09:45.934
But by the Easter Saturday, I knew it was Diana.

254
00:09:46.814 --> 00:09:49.705
So then John, Dr. John Briffa arrived

255
00:09:49.705 --> 00:09:53.332
and by this time I was in a really bad way.

256
00:09:53.332 --> 00:09:56.271
I was beginning to slightly decompose.

257
00:09:56.271 --> 00:09:57.704
My gums were bleeding,

258
00:09:57.704 --> 00:10:00.029
my eyes were changing color all the time.

259
00:10:00.029 --> 00:10:03.378
I was half in this world and half in another.

260
00:10:04.888 --> 00:10:08.529
I was having great trouble remaining physical.

261
00:10:08.529 --> 00:10:11.686
So by the time John arrived I knew I was dying.

262
00:10:13.406 --> 00:10:16.475
Actually I'm finding really hard to talk about this.

263
00:10:16.475 --> 00:10:18.544
<v Voiceover>Quite an amazing journey.</v>

264
00:10:20.604 --> 00:10:24.387
And so, as this goes along...

265
00:10:26.467 --> 00:10:28.598
How long did it take for you to understand this was

266
00:10:28.598 --> 00:10:32.897
what is called a spiritual emergency, or emergence,

267
00:10:32.897 --> 00:10:34.033
as the word is more

268
00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:35.018
appropriately
<v ->But it was</v>

269
00:10:35.018 --> 00:10:36.518
about three months,

270
00:10:36.518 --> 00:10:39.846
because eventually I met various healers

271
00:10:41.626 --> 00:10:43.568
and after John had got me back,

272
00:10:43.568 --> 00:10:45.243
because I left my physical body

273
00:10:45.243 --> 00:10:47.131
and I knew I was dead.

274
00:10:48.031 --> 00:10:50.608
Because I could see this thing down on the bed below me

275
00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:52.272
and you know I thought: " Jesus"

276
00:10:52.272 --> 00:10:53.904
"who would want to go back into that?"

277
00:10:53.904 --> 00:10:55.514
I had no wish to return.

278
00:10:55.514 --> 00:10:56.816
I was totally detached.

279
00:10:56.816 --> 00:11:00.145
My husband, I could see him clearly downstairs crying.

280
00:11:00.145 --> 00:11:02.950
I could see the doctor, trying to work on me and stuff,

281
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:07.291
but I had no wish to return and so...

282
00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:10.129
Sorry I've forgotten your question now, I'm getting all

283
00:11:10.129 --> 00:11:12.710
<v Voiceover>Oh, but you came to realize ultimately,</v>

284
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.346
you said it took a few months but then...

285
00:11:14.346 --> 00:11:15.205
<v ->It did.</v>

286
00:11:15.205 --> 00:11:16.838
<v Voiceover>This was a spiritual emergence</v>

287
00:11:16.838 --> 00:11:18.395
<v ->Right, because then I realized</v>

288
00:11:18.395 --> 00:11:21.531
that I was getting or that I had access to gifts

289
00:11:21.531 --> 00:11:23.771
but I wasn't... I started making ash.

290
00:11:23.771 --> 00:11:26.715
I was crashing electronic equipment.

291
00:11:26.715 --> 00:11:29.530
I could see people as beings of light.

292
00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:30.628
In other words, I could see

293
00:11:30.628 --> 00:11:32.148
pretty much straight through people.

294
00:11:32.148 --> 00:11:33.647
I was seeing energy fields.

295
00:11:33.647 --> 00:11:35.023
I could see other dimensions.

296
00:11:35.023 --> 00:11:36.569
I could hear other dimensions.

297
00:11:36.569 --> 00:11:38.615
To some people this sounds crazy,

298
00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:41.356
to others it's part of everyday life these days

299
00:11:41.356 --> 00:11:43.778
but I didn't know that in the moment.

300
00:11:45.198 --> 00:11:46.422
It took me a while.

301
00:11:46.422 --> 00:11:48.107
In the end I saw a scientist,

302
00:11:48.107 --> 00:11:49.389
Dr. Serene Roney Dougal.

303
00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:51.693
I went to Glastonbury, she has a research centre there.

304
00:11:51.693 --> 00:11:53.726
And she has helped quite a few people

305
00:11:53.726 --> 00:11:55.401
who are going through spiritual emergency.

306
00:11:55.401 --> 00:11:57.188
I had interviewed her for the the Sunday Times,

307
00:11:57.188 --> 00:11:59.833
so I thought well if I go there she'll know what to do.

308
00:11:59.833 --> 00:12:03.225
Because at this point I was beginning to dematerialize

309
00:12:03.225 --> 00:12:06.435
and rematerialize and materialize objects and so on.

310
00:12:07.345 --> 00:12:08.703
In other words, as I thought

311
00:12:08.703 --> 00:12:11.210
I was creating my reality instantly.

312
00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.702
I'd become coherent but now I know that

313
00:12:14.702 --> 00:12:15.886
but I didn't know it then

314
00:12:15.886 --> 00:12:17.545
In other words, I was doing these things

315
00:12:17.545 --> 00:12:19.455
but I didn't know how I was doing them.

316
00:12:21.425 --> 00:12:22.611
I told her the story

317
00:12:22.611 --> 00:12:25.821
and my ego had begun to come into play big time.

318
00:12:28.441 --> 00:12:30.983
I said to her, I looked her straight in the eye and I said:

319
00:12:30.983 --> 00:12:34.215
"I know I'm becoming some kind of spiritual master."

320
00:12:34.215 --> 00:12:36.192
And she put her hands on my shoulders

321
00:12:36.192 --> 00:12:37.728
and she said: "I want you to listen."

322
00:12:37.728 --> 00:12:40.213
She said: "You are only Hazel."

323
00:12:40.213 --> 00:12:42.357
She was trying to ground me

324
00:12:43.777 --> 00:12:45.535
and I was about to explode.

325
00:12:45.535 --> 00:12:48.191
I know how spontaneous combustion works now.

326
00:12:48.191 --> 00:12:50.100
The energy field was so enormous.

327
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.946
She said I want you to say that.

328
00:12:51.946 --> 00:12:53.482
I want you to keep saying it.

329
00:12:53.482 --> 00:12:56.159
So there was a renowned scientist telling me

330
00:12:56.159 --> 00:12:57.087
that I was only Hazel,

331
00:12:57.087 --> 00:12:58.196
so I kept saying:

332
00:12:58.196 --> 00:13:01.246
"I am only Hazel. I am only Hazel. I am only Hazel."

333
00:13:01.246 --> 00:13:04.969
To the point where I believed it 100%.

334
00:13:04.969 --> 00:13:08.467
In that moment I instantly created my reality.

335
00:13:08.467 --> 00:13:11.240
It was like this enormous vortex

336
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.383
cause I had thunder and lightning over me

337
00:13:14.047 --> 00:13:18.321
almost consistently for 6, 7, 8 weeks?

338
00:13:18.321 --> 00:13:22.012
Everywhere I went, there was a thunderstorm outside

339
00:13:22.012 --> 00:13:24.727
and I knew that somehow this had something to do

340
00:13:24.727 --> 00:13:26.235
with what was happening.

341
00:13:27.615 --> 00:13:30.523
It was like this genie, this enormous genie

342
00:13:30.523 --> 00:13:31.878
just went (makes crasing noise)

343
00:13:31.878 --> 00:13:32.742
and that was it.

344
00:13:33.882 --> 00:13:36.933
I could still hear Diana and various other spirits

345
00:13:36.933 --> 00:13:39.584
and I could still see auras

346
00:13:39.594 --> 00:13:43.720
but pretty much from that moment everything else ceased.

347
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.002
I had my life back.

348
00:13:45.002 --> 00:13:47.540
It was weird because for all those weeks

349
00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.527
when I was able to do all those amazing things,

350
00:13:50.527 --> 00:13:52.180
which I used to call my tricks,

351
00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.903
I desperately wanted it to stop

352
00:13:55.903 --> 00:13:58.007
but I once I hadn't got it,

353
00:13:58.007 --> 00:13:59.684
once it had all gone I was like:

354
00:13:59.684 --> 00:14:01.764
"Can I have this back please?"

355
00:14:01.764 --> 00:14:02.503
(laughs)

356
00:14:02.503 --> 00:14:05.150
I've been trying to do that ever since.

357
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.531
<v Voiceover>So although you may have lost</v>

358
00:14:07.531 --> 00:14:09.184
your little bag of tricks you

359
00:14:09.184 --> 00:14:11.504
were left with so much more.
<v ->the knowledge</v>

360
00:14:11.504 --> 00:14:12.434
The experience.

361
00:14:12.434 --> 00:14:15.484
In other words, now I know that for a moment in time

362
00:14:15.484 --> 00:14:17.873
I won the spiritual lottery.

363
00:14:17.873 --> 00:14:21.766
I know I was shown through the looking glass

364
00:14:21.766 --> 00:14:23.878
just for a really brief time,

365
00:14:23.878 --> 00:14:26.523
but the main thing is now, that like,

366
00:14:26.523 --> 00:14:28.155
when I write about this stuff now

367
00:14:28.155 --> 00:14:30.651
it's all very well going off to the Himalayas

368
00:14:30.651 --> 00:14:32.326
or meeting an enlghtened master

369
00:14:32.326 --> 00:14:33.973
and then telling him: " You are God"

370
00:14:33.973 --> 00:14:35.376
"and we're all God and we're all one."

371
00:14:35.376 --> 00:14:38.384
But knowing it and experiencing it

372
00:14:38.384 --> 00:14:40.314
are two different things.

373
00:14:40.314 --> 00:14:42.079
<v Voiceover>and it's interesting because</v>

374
00:14:42.079 --> 00:14:45.034
other people that I've spoken with through the years

375
00:14:45.034 --> 00:14:47.433
and some that we have also interviewed

376
00:14:47.433 --> 00:14:51.647
have had a similar type of spiritual emergency

377
00:14:51.647 --> 00:14:55.145
but what strikes me as, it is certainly showing you

378
00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:56.798
what is possible.

379
00:14:56.798 --> 00:14:59.059
<v ->Well I think now it's just like</v>

380
00:14:59.059 --> 00:15:02.206
now I write about things like theater healing

381
00:15:02.206 --> 00:15:04.627
and spontaneous healing and telepathy

382
00:15:04.627 --> 00:15:06.771
and I've been on various other journeys

383
00:15:06.771 --> 00:15:09.213
and found scientists that who deal with this kind of stuff

384
00:15:09.213 --> 00:15:10.824
and have the science behind it,

385
00:15:11.674 --> 00:15:13.320
which for me is very exciting,

386
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.868
but yes I think that there is obviously

387
00:15:16.868 --> 00:15:18.300
a huge awakening going on

388
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.878
but to know that miracles

389
00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:25.155
and to also more than anything to know that

390
00:15:25.155 --> 00:15:27.598
we're so much more than we think we are

391
00:15:27.598 --> 00:15:30.691
and that I was using at the height of my experience

392
00:15:30.691 --> 00:15:32.974
maybe I was using 20 to 25%

393
00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:35.188
of my brain's potential capabilities.

394
00:15:35.188 --> 00:15:40.137
Can you even begin to imagine what we would be capable of?

395
00:15:40.137 --> 00:15:41.673
<v Voiceover>Once we believe we're capable.</v>

396
00:15:41.673 --> 00:15:42.473
<v ->Whoa.</v>

397
00:15:42.473 --> 00:15:44.574
<v Voiceover>It is amazing and...</v>

398
00:15:45.924 --> 00:15:47.273
a moment ago you touched on the fact that

399
00:15:47.273 --> 00:15:49.415
you had begun speaking with other people

400
00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:51.836
in the scientific arena about your experiences

401
00:15:51.836 --> 00:15:54.300
and this in this portion

402
00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.718
it's at some point along the way

403
00:15:55.718 --> 00:15:58.278
you came in contact with Dr. Gary Schwartz.

404
00:15:58.278 --> 00:15:59.142
<v ->Yes I did.</v>

405
00:15:59.142 --> 00:16:01.070
<v ->Wonderful scientist in Arizona</v>

406
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:04.281
who has written the Afterlife Experiments

407
00:16:04.281 --> 00:16:05.698
and has dealt with some of the,

408
00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:08.951
probably the creme de la creme of the medium world

409
00:16:08.951 --> 00:16:10.529
and the United States.

410
00:16:10.529 --> 00:16:12.758
Now you went to

411
00:16:12.758 --> 00:16:14.059
<v ->What happened was</v>

412
00:16:14.059 --> 00:16:15.649
<v ->Arizona. And what happened then?</v>

413
00:16:15.649 --> 00:16:16.960
<v ->Because what I did was I wrote the story</v>

414
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.245
of what happened to me in a book called Divine Intervention,

415
00:16:19.245 --> 00:16:21.018
which came out friev or six years ago

416
00:16:21.018 --> 00:16:23.343
and then my publisher's asked me for a sequel

417
00:16:23.343 --> 00:16:27.588
and I by a long... by many synchronicities

418
00:16:27.588 --> 00:16:29.105
I ended up... Gary...

419
00:16:29.105 --> 00:16:30.546
he very kindly read my book

420
00:16:30.546 --> 00:16:33.606
and was still speaking to me afterwards

421
00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:38.364
He said: "If you really had contact with Princess Diana"

422
00:16:38.364 --> 00:16:40.508
" you would be willing to get on a plane"

423
00:16:40.508 --> 00:16:44.380
"and come take part in the Afterlife Experiments in Arizona"

424
00:16:44.383 --> 00:16:45.815
and before I knew where I was,

425
00:16:45.815 --> 00:16:50.444
in October 2003, I flew to Arizona.

426
00:16:51.734 --> 00:16:53.846
Gary tested me with two mediums.

427
00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:55.350
One was called Allison Dubois

428
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:57.121
and the other was Lori Campbell.

429
00:16:57.121 --> 00:17:00.470
They were told that someone was coming for a reading.

430
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.782
They didn't know which country I'd come from.

431
00:17:02.782 --> 00:17:05.045
They didn't know whether they were meeting a man or a woman

432
00:17:05.045 --> 00:17:06.677
and likewise for me.

433
00:17:06.677 --> 00:17:08.544
Gary was very strict about that

434
00:17:08.544 --> 00:17:10.101
and he's very strict thank goodness.

435
00:17:10.921 --> 00:17:13.642
Yes, I know that we're never gonna convince the skeptics

436
00:17:13.642 --> 00:17:17.226
but we went one Sunday afternoon in October.

437
00:17:17.686 --> 00:17:20.138
First of all, Allison Dubois came in.

438
00:17:21.178 --> 00:17:23.950
Gary had asked her to sit quietly and just tune in

439
00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:25.774
to whoever might be in his study.

440
00:17:25.774 --> 00:17:27.704
He filmed it and recorded it.

441
00:17:29.754 --> 00:17:30.720
Allison...

442
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.491
First of all she picked up my mother.

443
00:17:32.491 --> 00:17:34.287
Now remember we've never met.

444
00:17:34.287 --> 00:17:35.845
She didn't know which country I was from.

445
00:17:35.845 --> 00:17:37.220
She didn't know which language I spoke.

446
00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.660
I wasn't allowed to speak.

447
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.969
Within 30 seconds she picked up my mother,

448
00:17:42.969 --> 00:17:45.860
given me intimate details she couldn't possibly have known

449
00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.025
about my mother, which was great

450
00:17:48.025 --> 00:17:51.097
but I hadn't flown 4000 miles to hear from my mother

451
00:17:51.097 --> 00:17:53.864
so then all of a sudden she switched and she said:

452
00:17:53.864 --> 00:17:56.754
"I've no idea if I'm wasting your time"

453
00:17:56.754 --> 00:17:59.634
but she said: "I'm seeing Paris and the Ritz."

454
00:17:59.634 --> 00:18:02.108
She said: "I can see Princess Diana."

455
00:18:02.108 --> 00:18:03.314
<v Voiceover>Was this Allison you said?</v>

456
00:18:03.314 --> 00:18:04.594
<v ->Yeah that was Allison.</v>

457
00:18:04.594 --> 00:18:06.942
<v Voiceover>And she's the one featured in the movie</v>

458
00:18:06.942 --> 00:18:08.550
the Medium and the series the Medium

459
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:09.397
<v ->Yeah that's right.</v>

460
00:18:09.397 --> 00:18:10.677
And she's a brilliant medium

461
00:18:10.677 --> 00:18:11.722
beautiful young woman.

462
00:18:13.522 --> 00:18:15.381
So she came up with Princess Diana

463
00:18:15.381 --> 00:18:19.978
and then she said some amazing things.

464
00:18:19.978 --> 00:18:22.794
She said... Gary then interrupted at some point

465
00:18:22.794 --> 00:18:24.148
because we were together for an hour

466
00:18:24.148 --> 00:18:27.241
and said: "Can you tell me what the relationship is"

467
00:18:27.241 --> 00:18:29.033
"between the sitter", who was me

468
00:18:29.033 --> 00:18:31.774
" and Princess Diana?"

469
00:18:31.774 --> 00:18:33.726
And it was incredible.

470
00:18:33.726 --> 00:18:36.482
Allison put her hands together, she said:

471
00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:40.343
"It was like they were like this, but apart."

472
00:18:40.343 --> 00:18:43.138
She said: "They came together as they were one."

473
00:18:43.138 --> 00:18:45.473
I mean that was profound.

474
00:18:45.473 --> 00:18:49.334
And she said: "Diana is saying to this person,"

475
00:18:49.334 --> 00:18:51.937
"thank you for doing what you did"

476
00:18:51.937 --> 00:18:53.121
"and writing what you did."

477
00:18:53.121 --> 00:18:55.051
At that point I started to cry.

478
00:18:57.961 --> 00:19:00.715
Because the skeptics can think what they like

479
00:19:00.715 --> 00:19:02.880
but for me that was like great verification.

480
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.376
And then she gave some other facts and figures

481
00:19:05.376 --> 00:19:06.421
and we wrote it all down.

482
00:19:06.421 --> 00:19:08.597
Then Alison left the property

483
00:19:08.597 --> 00:19:12.111
and then another medium called Lori Campbell came in.

484
00:19:13.489 --> 00:19:14.793
Again we'd never met.

485
00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:18.280
Lori said: "I'm seeing England here."

486
00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.912
Now I could have been German.

487
00:19:19.912 --> 00:19:20.872
I could have been Swedish.

488
00:19:20.872 --> 00:19:21.839
I could have been anything.

489
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:24.520
She said: "I'm seeing writing."

490
00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.269
"This woman is something to do with writing."

491
00:19:26.909 --> 00:19:28.296
She described my house,

492
00:19:28.296 --> 00:19:30.130
which Gary had never seen.

493
00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:31.976
She described it to a tee.

494
00:19:32.656 --> 00:19:34.478
Then within two minutes again,

495
00:19:34.478 --> 00:19:38.851
she said: "I'm seeing a C and a D here"

496
00:19:38.851 --> 00:19:40.408
and she said: "I don't know why"

497
00:19:40.408 --> 00:19:41.784
"but I can see Kensington Palace."

498
00:19:42.754 --> 00:19:45.348
She said: "I'm sorry but I don't know if I'm wasting"

499
00:19:45.348 --> 00:19:47.981
"this lady's time but I have Princess Diana here."

500
00:19:49.131 --> 00:19:52.152
Then it went on for about half an hour.

501
00:19:52.152 --> 00:19:55.320
Then Gary again interrupted and said:

502
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.519
"Can you tell me what the relationship was between"

503
00:19:58.519 --> 00:20:02.274
"Hazel", me, "and Princess Diana?"

504
00:20:02.274 --> 00:20:06.807
Lori said: "It was like Hazel was hit by an express train"

505
00:20:06.807 --> 00:20:08.855
"and didn't know what the hell was going on"

506
00:20:08.855 --> 00:20:11.852
"but it altered her life forever."

507
00:20:13.492 --> 00:20:14.902
And it sure did.

508
00:20:14.902 --> 00:20:18.241
Because in other words, one week I was unhappy

509
00:20:18.241 --> 00:20:20.449
and writing very successfully for the Sunday Times

510
00:20:20.449 --> 00:20:21.942
and many other national newspapers

511
00:20:21.942 --> 00:20:24.555
and then all of a sudden I had to swing away

512
00:20:24.555 --> 00:20:26.955
and go on this incredibly spiritual journey.

513
00:20:26.955 --> 00:20:28.539
<v Voiceover>What was the nature...</v>

514
00:20:28.539 --> 00:20:30.891
I'm going to ask you more about the journey

515
00:20:30.891 --> 00:20:33.098
and some of the work you're doing now

516
00:20:33.098 --> 00:20:35.189
but if I may just take a moment.

517
00:20:35.189 --> 00:20:38.495
What was- did you ever figure out why it was

518
00:20:38.495 --> 00:20:41.631
that Diana had wanted to reach you?

519
00:20:41.631 --> 00:20:43.029
What were the messages?

520
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:46.996
<v ->I think that say for instance Tom Cruise</v>

521
00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:49.439
was asked by a charity to represent that charity

522
00:20:49.439 --> 00:20:51.465
it would be in all the newspapers and magazines

523
00:20:51.465 --> 00:20:53.695
because Tom Cruise had wanted to front a charity.

524
00:20:53.695 --> 00:20:55.753
And I think the spirit world...

525
00:20:55.753 --> 00:20:57.826
First of all I don't think you can get a spirit

526
00:20:57.826 --> 00:20:59.149
to do something they don't want to do.

527
00:21:00.009 --> 00:21:03.159
So I think the spirit- I think that in this case

528
00:21:03.159 --> 00:21:05.751
willingly she became a spokesperson

529
00:21:05.751 --> 00:21:08.311
in that one moment in time.

530
00:21:08.311 --> 00:21:11.116
They'd said are you interested in trying

531
00:21:11.116 --> 00:21:12.278
to get the story out,

532
00:21:12.278 --> 00:21:14.785
that human consciousness survives physical death

533
00:21:14.785 --> 00:21:17.355
and she was a very famous person.

534
00:21:18.405 --> 00:21:20.017
I now know that she's coming through

535
00:21:20.017 --> 00:21:21.905
to thousands of good mediums

536
00:21:21.905 --> 00:21:24.529
and many other people who are claiming contact with her

537
00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:26.406
and many other famous people

538
00:21:26.406 --> 00:21:28.155
<v Voiceover>cause she's an ambassador from the other side</v>

539
00:21:28.155 --> 00:21:30.956
<v ->Yeah, and I think that now I don't even try</v>

540
00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:32.396
and contact her so much anymore

541
00:21:32.396 --> 00:21:34.401
cause lots of other people are already doing that.

542
00:21:34.401 --> 00:21:36.748
In other words, I was just there for that brief moment.

543
00:21:38.248 --> 00:21:40.385
I would say why are spirits doing this?

544
00:21:40.385 --> 00:21:41.963
It's almost like they're turning up the heat

545
00:21:41.963 --> 00:21:43.912
so that people like Gary

546
00:21:43.912 --> 00:21:47.282
can do their experiments

547
00:21:47.282 --> 00:21:50.693
and finally come out of the closet and say:

548
00:21:50.693 --> 00:21:53.548
"Yes we are recycled atoms."

549
00:21:53.548 --> 00:21:55.596
"Yes we are recycled consciousness."

550
00:21:55.596 --> 00:21:59.457
"And yes, human consciousness survives physical death."

551
00:22:00.327 --> 00:22:03.510
I think that for a brief moment in time I played a part

552
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:05.451
but I do know that I'm very lucky to be alive

553
00:22:05.451 --> 00:22:07.364
to sit here and tell a tale.

554
00:22:07.364 --> 00:22:08.974
<v Voiceover>So where has this led you?</v>

555
00:22:08.974 --> 00:22:10.393
You have another wonderful book

556
00:22:10.393 --> 00:22:12.579
that has just recently been published.

557
00:22:12.579 --> 00:22:13.486
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

558
00:22:13.486 --> 00:22:16.217
So what I did was I went on to write two other health books

559
00:22:16.217 --> 00:22:17.348
then my publisher asked me if

560
00:22:17.348 --> 00:22:19.427
I'd like to do a sequel to Divine

561
00:22:19.427 --> 00:22:20.558
and I thought well crikey

562
00:22:20.558 --> 00:22:21.574
that's going to be a bit boring

563
00:22:21.574 --> 00:22:23.526
cause nothing that thrilling as it were

564
00:22:23.526 --> 00:22:24.827
or traumatic had happened

565
00:22:24.827 --> 00:22:29.243
but the minute I committed to saying ok I'll do this

566
00:22:29.243 --> 00:22:31.312
then I ended up in Arizona with Gary

567
00:22:31.312 --> 00:22:32.468
and then Gary would give me the name

568
00:22:32.468 --> 00:22:34.100
of people like Bill Tiller.

569
00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.031
From Bill Tiller I thought well

570
00:22:36.031 --> 00:22:37.443
I'm going to speak to Stan Grof,

571
00:22:37.443 --> 00:22:38.755
Professor Stanislav Grof,

572
00:22:38.755 --> 00:22:41.293
who's been studying spiritual emergency

573
00:22:41.293 --> 00:22:43.576
for nearly fifty years in San Francisco.

574
00:22:43.576 --> 00:22:45.762
So before I knew where I was,

575
00:22:45.762 --> 00:22:47.874
I then was meeting other people

576
00:22:47.874 --> 00:22:50.658
who'd gone through spiritual emergencies similar to mine.

577
00:22:50.658 --> 00:22:52.759
It's like giving birth to a baby.

578
00:22:52.759 --> 00:22:54.850
There are lots of similarities but everybody's

579
00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:57.335
perception and their experience is unique.

580
00:22:59.745 --> 00:23:02.639
I met one dear lady who'd had a spiritual emergency while

581
00:23:02.639 --> 00:23:06.244
her kundalini had blown while going up an escalator

582
00:23:06.244 --> 00:23:07.503
in a department store.

583
00:23:07.503 --> 00:23:10.190
But she ended up 20 years in a mental home.

584
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:11.769
<v Voiceover>And this does happen</v>

585
00:23:11.769 --> 00:23:13.881
<v ->It happens all the time.</v>

586
00:23:14.781 --> 00:23:17.539
Now I lecture about spiritual emergency.

587
00:23:17.539 --> 00:23:21.080
I lecture about our potential capabilities.

588
00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:25.037
It's just like I'm part of a link and a chain.

589
00:23:25.037 --> 00:23:27.107
It's just trying to get the word out there.

590
00:23:27.107 --> 00:23:30.733
<v  Voiceover>So if you can give some, a synopsis of sorts</v>

591
00:23:30.733 --> 00:23:32.365
of what you learned during the journey

592
00:23:32.365 --> 00:23:35.085
of writing this book call Evidence of the Sixth Sense

593
00:23:35.085 --> 00:23:36.973
from all these different scientists

594
00:23:36.973 --> 00:23:38.466
and people who've experienced it,

595
00:23:38.466 --> 00:23:40.162
what would you say this book is about?

596
00:23:40.162 --> 00:23:45.058
<v ->Well, it's about bridging the gap</v>

597
00:23:45.058 --> 00:23:47.244
between science and miracles.

598
00:23:47.244 --> 00:23:49.953
Because, for instance Stan Grof explained to me

599
00:23:49.953 --> 00:23:52.673
very coherently the difference between psychosis

600
00:23:52.673 --> 00:23:54.049
and a spiritual emergency.

601
00:23:54.049 --> 00:23:56.033
So that was really fascinating.

602
00:23:56.033 --> 00:23:58.934
And how it can happen to anybody at any time

603
00:23:58.934 --> 00:24:00.811
but if you know what's happening

604
00:24:00.811 --> 00:24:02.048
you can learn to handle it.

605
00:24:03.518 --> 00:24:05.984
He explained which foods you should eat,

606
00:24:05.984 --> 00:24:07.339
which foods you shouldn't eat,

607
00:24:07.339 --> 00:24:08.619
how to ground yourself.

608
00:24:09.859 --> 00:24:12.544
What to do while you're in the midst of all this

609
00:24:12.544 --> 00:24:13.952
spiritual emergence.

610
00:24:13.952 --> 00:24:15.616
<v Voiceover>Give us just a hint on some of the foods</v>

611
00:24:15.616 --> 00:24:16.661
you should or shouldn't eat...

612
00:24:16.661 --> 00:24:17.426
<v ->Well the main thing is</v>

613
00:24:17.426 --> 00:24:19.314
and I'm sure anyone out there whose very spiritual

614
00:24:19.314 --> 00:24:20.274
will already know this.

615
00:24:20.274 --> 00:24:24.349
If I'd have known when I was starting to dematerialize

616
00:24:24.349 --> 00:24:26.280
that if I could have just gone outside

617
00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.957
and lain on the ground to ground myself.

618
00:24:30.207 --> 00:24:32.615
I had to eat lots of sugar to keep myself grounded.

619
00:24:33.725 --> 00:24:35.425
Earthing foods like porridge

620
00:24:36.535 --> 00:24:39.638
because it got to the point where, when I did start eating

621
00:24:39.638 --> 00:24:41.714
I couldn't , even if I walked in a room

622
00:24:41.714 --> 00:24:43.015
where there was a piece of chicken

623
00:24:43.015 --> 00:24:44.668
I'd have to leave the room,

624
00:24:44.668 --> 00:24:47.738
because I could feel how that animal had died.

625
00:24:47.738 --> 00:24:49.391
I could actually feel it.

626
00:24:49.391 --> 00:24:51.481
And I remember it actually made me nauseous.

627
00:24:51.481 --> 00:24:53.988
Cause I knew, I felt the negative energies.

628
00:24:53.988 --> 00:24:55.648
I couldn't even read a newspaper

629
00:24:55.648 --> 00:24:57.727
because if I saw the picture of a dead body

630
00:24:57.727 --> 00:25:01.013
I knew what that person had done or how they'd died.

631
00:25:01.013 --> 00:25:02.304
It was shocking

632
00:25:02.304 --> 00:25:04.927
but it was also blissful at times

633
00:25:04.927 --> 00:25:06.869
especially to be telepathic

634
00:25:06.869 --> 00:25:08.979
that was great to be able to answer people's questions.

635
00:25:09.699 --> 00:25:11.380
Sorry I'm deviating a bit here.

636
00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.026
I think the main thing is

637
00:25:14.026 --> 00:25:15.829
if you're going through a spiritual emergency

638
00:25:15.829 --> 00:25:19.764
is to not go ringing the White House and saying:

639
00:25:19.764 --> 00:25:21.396
"I'm the new world savior."

640
00:25:22.546 --> 00:25:24.959
It's time to write down all the insights

641
00:25:24.959 --> 00:25:26.452
because you think you're always going to

642
00:25:26.452 --> 00:25:28.244
know all these things and you're not

643
00:25:28.244 --> 00:25:29.289
you're gonna forget them.

644
00:25:29.289 --> 00:25:33.470
So keeping a spiritual diet is really important.

645
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.614
Eat lots of earthing foods

646
00:25:35.614 --> 00:25:38.152
and even if you don't want to eat physical food

647
00:25:38.152 --> 00:25:40.264
cause you know you can live on Divine light

648
00:25:40.264 --> 00:25:41.694
I know I went through that stage too

649
00:25:41.694 --> 00:25:45.320
So it's... you're God in a physical body.

650
00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.179
You need to look after that physical body.

651
00:25:48.179 --> 00:25:49.949
And remember you're brain is cooking.

652
00:25:49.949 --> 00:25:50.994
You need nourishment.

653
00:25:52.354 --> 00:25:54.274
Even if you can only eat soups and stews

654
00:25:54.274 --> 00:25:55.683
and all that kind of stuff.

655
00:25:55.683 --> 00:25:56.683
And get help.

656
00:25:56.683 --> 00:25:59.358
Go anywhere to any spiritiual centre

657
00:25:59.358 --> 00:26:01.420
<v Voiceover>But you don't mean going to the family doctor.</v>

658
00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.393
<v ->No I don't necessarily, but the thing is you see if</v>

659
00:26:03.393 --> 00:26:06.028
it becomes a crisis it's multifactorial.

660
00:26:06.028 --> 00:26:08.790
There are so many hundreds of realities

661
00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:10.593
that I understood during those two months.

662
00:26:10.593 --> 00:26:13.430
If a person starts to self harm

663
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:16.673
or if they know that they can fly from a window

664
00:26:16.673 --> 00:26:19.552
that's when you need restraining in some way

665
00:26:19.552 --> 00:26:22.439
but the kind of restraining that we talk about

666
00:26:22.439 --> 00:26:24.583
in orthodox institutions is not

667
00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:26.396
the kind of restraining I'm talking about.

668
00:26:26.396 --> 00:26:29.489
Because remember, you are in such a heightened state.

669
00:26:29.489 --> 00:26:30.353
You are convinced

670
00:26:30.353 --> 00:26:32.305
that the rest of the world are just total idiots

671
00:26:32.305 --> 00:26:34.908
and that you are the one and only person on the planet

672
00:26:34.908 --> 00:26:36.284
that knows all this stuff.

673
00:26:37.774 --> 00:26:39.398
I knew I could time travel.

674
00:26:39.398 --> 00:26:41.190
I knew I could do all sorts of things.

675
00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:43.771
but of course my poor husband he was just...

676
00:26:43.771 --> 00:26:45.851
but the most interesting thing was

677
00:26:45.851 --> 00:26:48.432
once it had gone on for a couple of months

678
00:26:48.432 --> 00:26:50.245
I didn't need much sleep.

679
00:26:50.245 --> 00:26:52.688
In fact there are many nights when I didn't need any at all

680
00:26:52.688 --> 00:26:54.032
because I had so much energy.

681
00:26:55.102 --> 00:26:57.392
So I remember once we were walking through the park

682
00:26:57.392 --> 00:26:58.746
and I was really going for it

683
00:26:58.746 --> 00:27:00.314
and he said: "Hazel how can you do this"

684
00:27:00.314 --> 00:27:01.690
"when you're so tired?"

685
00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.762
And he said: "Why aren't I too tired too?"

686
00:27:04.762 --> 00:27:06.575
And he looked me in the eyes,

687
00:27:06.575 --> 00:27:09.327
which were like huge black pools of knowing,

688
00:27:09.327 --> 00:27:12.335
and he said: "It's because I'm in your energy field."

689
00:27:14.115 --> 00:27:17.476
You know, I am my mother, father, become one

690
00:27:17.476 --> 00:27:20.889
So I suppose in the new book

691
00:27:20.889 --> 00:27:22.595
I've interviewed people like Bill Tiller

692
00:27:22.595 --> 00:27:23.971
who starred in What the Bleep?

693
00:27:25.241 --> 00:27:27.299
He told me about all of his experiments

694
00:27:27.299 --> 00:27:29.592
about how our thoughts create our reality.

695
00:27:29.592 --> 00:27:31.779
I interviewed Stan Grof.

696
00:27:31.779 --> 00:27:35.981
I interviewed some wonderful scientists in Ohio

697
00:27:35.981 --> 00:27:38.765
who now can actually show in science

698
00:27:38.765 --> 00:27:41.389
if someone is completely enlightened or not

699
00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:43.149
and the graphs are shown in the book.

700
00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:45.890
Total coherence of the brain.

701
00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.332
And of course then I automatically understood

702
00:27:48.332 --> 00:27:50.562
how spontaneous healing can occur.

703
00:27:50.562 --> 00:27:54.220
Because once you have coherence in the brain,

704
00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.567
total coherence, then that coherence

705
00:27:56.567 --> 00:27:58.593
is communicated to every cell in the body

706
00:27:58.593 --> 00:28:02.966
and every cell in the body in an instant becomes coherent.

707
00:28:02.966 --> 00:28:05.222
The illness just goes away.

708
00:28:05.222 --> 00:28:07.878
To anyone out there who's terribly sick,

709
00:28:07.878 --> 00:28:10.598
I know I'm making it sound very simple

710
00:28:12.518 --> 00:28:14.619
but I now know how it works.

711
00:28:16.379 --> 00:28:18.651
It was a very very interesting journey

712
00:28:18.651 --> 00:28:20.443
and the very end of the journey

713
00:28:20.443 --> 00:28:22.928
was that just as I was about to finish the book

714
00:28:22.928 --> 00:28:24.997
Gary Schwartz rang me from America and he said:

715
00:28:24.997 --> 00:28:26.490
"What are you going to be doing next Sunday

716
00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:27.887
at 7:00 in the evening

717
00:28:27.887 --> 00:28:28.873
and I said: "Well I'm gonna be here"

718
00:28:28.873 --> 00:28:30.106
"writing this health book."

719
00:28:30.106 --> 00:28:32.324
I actually do at 7:00 on a Sunday night.

720
00:28:32.324 --> 00:28:33.722
And I said: "Why?"

721
00:28:33.722 --> 00:28:35.396
He said: "Because I'm gonna call you at that time."

722
00:28:35.396 --> 00:28:37.465
Now I did not know what was going on

723
00:28:37.465 --> 00:28:40.068
but unbeknown to me

724
00:28:40.068 --> 00:28:42.329
a television program was being made in America

725
00:28:42.329 --> 00:28:44.196
about a medium called Sally Morgan.

726
00:28:45.176 --> 00:28:48.313
And the program had asked Gary to double blind test

727
00:28:48.313 --> 00:28:53.102
this medium in Westport, Connecticut in June of 2004.

728
00:28:55.622 --> 00:28:57.880
Gary had never met the medium.

729
00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.576
The medium had never met Gary.

730
00:28:59.576 --> 00:29:01.901
So I know the skeptics will say I'm sure they have.

731
00:29:01.901 --> 00:29:04.344
but I personally believe that they had never met.

732
00:29:04.344 --> 00:29:08.217
So Gary decides that his research assistant,

733
00:29:08.217 --> 00:29:10.338
she's Dr. Julie Bushell,

734
00:29:10.357 --> 00:29:12.732
will act as a sitter

735
00:29:12.732 --> 00:29:14.104
and they're going to see

736
00:29:14.104 --> 00:29:16.898
if Sally can pick up Princess Diana.

737
00:29:16.898 --> 00:29:18.370
Now I didn't know any of this was happening.

738
00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.899
So they're in Westport Connecticut

739
00:29:21.899 --> 00:29:24.480
and Sally meets the medium who's British

740
00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.104
and she drops a bombshell as it were in his lap

741
00:29:27.104 --> 00:29:28.075
because she said,

742
00:29:28.075 --> 00:29:31.925
she tells Gary, she's like showing off a bit I suppose.

743
00:29:31.925 --> 00:29:34.997
and she said: "Oh, I've read for lots of famous people."

744
00:29:34.997 --> 00:29:36.533
She was very nervous I believe.

745
00:29:36.533 --> 00:29:38.399
And he said: "Like who?"

746
00:29:38.399 --> 00:29:40.959
And she said: "Well I used to do Princess Diana every week."

747
00:29:41.579 --> 00:29:45.790
Now what are the chances of a TV show being made

748
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:48.766
about someone who the producers I don't think

749
00:29:48.766 --> 00:29:49.976
'til that moment

750
00:29:49.976 --> 00:29:51.352
and Gary certainly didn't know

751
00:29:51.352 --> 00:29:53.634
that she used to be Princess Diana's medium

752
00:29:53.634 --> 00:29:55.981
out of all the thousands of mediums on this planet?

753
00:29:56.621 --> 00:29:58.935
Anyway, they start recording

754
00:29:58.935 --> 00:30:01.196
and Gary says: "Right who are you tuning into?"

755
00:30:01.196 --> 00:30:04.097
Now there are six billion people on this planet

756
00:30:04.097 --> 00:30:08.012
and there's an awful lot of dead spirits over there too.

757
00:30:08.012 --> 00:30:09.526
Passed on spirits.

758
00:30:09.526 --> 00:30:13.473
and she made quite a few mistakes

759
00:30:13.473 --> 00:30:15.969
but she also within the first 30 seconds

760
00:30:15.969 --> 00:30:20.907
she starts saying things like this woman died very suddenly

761
00:30:20.907 --> 00:30:22.912
and there was a car involved

762
00:30:22.912 --> 00:30:25.707
and it wasn't supposed to end this way

763
00:30:25.707 --> 00:30:28.448
and talks about her children and la la la la la

764
00:30:28.448 --> 00:30:30.357
but of course I didn't know any of this.

765
00:30:30.357 --> 00:30:34.080
So then eventually the reading finishes and Gary rings me.

766
00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.914
It's now 7:00 on that Sunday evening.

767
00:30:35.914 --> 00:30:37.815
I said: "Hi Gary, what would you like me to do?"

768
00:30:37.815 --> 00:30:39.658
And he said: "Well I'm going to put you on the phone"

769
00:30:39.658 --> 00:30:41.016
"with a lady, her name is Sally,"

770
00:30:41.016 --> 00:30:42.606
"she's a medium from England."

771
00:30:42.606 --> 00:30:45.549
Now I'm like, why do you want me to talk to this woman?

772
00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:47.513
and he said: "I just want you to speak to her"

773
00:30:47.513 --> 00:30:49.048
"but you cannot give her your name."

774
00:30:49.708 --> 00:30:51.256
So I say to Sally:

775
00:30:51.256 --> 00:30:51.866
"How are you?"

776
00:30:51.866 --> 00:30:53.231
I don't know what to say

777
00:30:53.231 --> 00:30:55.972
and in the end I say: "Look Sally, can you tell me"

778
00:30:55.972 --> 00:30:57.924
"who it is that I'm trying to reach?"

779
00:30:58.944 --> 00:31:01.977
Sally then starts to describe my garden in England

780
00:31:01.977 --> 00:31:03.456
as if she was standing there.

781
00:31:03.456 --> 00:31:04.587
It was incredible.

782
00:31:04.587 --> 00:31:07.200
She said: "Theres a woman there walking with you"

783
00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.762
" in that garden she's just turning around to face me now."

784
00:31:10.762 --> 00:31:15.199
and then you can hear this almost like a little squealette

785
00:31:15.199 --> 00:31:17.151
on the end of the phone and she says: "Oh my God."

786
00:31:17.151 --> 00:31:18.154
"It's Diana."

787
00:31:19.274 --> 00:31:21.855
and like, I'm like yeah yeah yeah

788
00:31:21.855 --> 00:31:24.575
but even I was fairly impressed.

789
00:31:26.025 --> 00:31:28.084
Then what happened was

790
00:31:28.084 --> 00:31:31.476
there was a phone in the room in Connecticut

791
00:31:31.476 --> 00:31:33.342
and the phone is ringing

792
00:31:33.342 --> 00:31:36.713
and the recording machine clicks in

793
00:31:36.713 --> 00:31:38.067
because they're filming

794
00:31:38.067 --> 00:31:41.790
and there's a voice on the recording machine

795
00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:44.328
saying, I think it was something like:

796
00:31:44.328 --> 00:31:46.259
"Why? why?"

797
00:31:46.259 --> 00:31:47.720
There was nobody there.

798
00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:51.826
So the television crew have this recording

799
00:31:51.826 --> 00:31:55.517
that we presume could be Diana's voice.

800
00:31:55.517 --> 00:31:59.005
Because people like professor David Fontana here in the UK

801
00:31:59.005 --> 00:32:03.026
have done huge amounts of work on electronic voice phenomena

802
00:32:03.026 --> 00:32:05.607
we know it happens, so all in all

803
00:32:05.607 --> 00:32:07.751
that gave me an interesting end to the book

804
00:32:07.751 --> 00:32:10.166
and it was really weird because the day

805
00:32:10.166 --> 00:32:11.937
that I was due to finish the book

806
00:32:11.937 --> 00:32:15.051
was the day that the Diana memorial opened,

807
00:32:15.051 --> 00:32:17.440
which is just across the road from here in London

808
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.605
and I just felt her.

809
00:32:19.605 --> 00:32:21.610
I had a dream about her, which I rarely do,

810
00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:24.117
and I ended up walking over to the monument

811
00:32:24.117 --> 00:32:26.015
at 5:30 in the morning

812
00:32:26.015 --> 00:32:27.455
and there was no one else there.

813
00:32:27.455 --> 00:32:31.007
It was a really lovely ending

814
00:32:31.007 --> 00:32:34.687
because it was like she was saying it's ok.

815
00:32:36.437 --> 00:32:37.854
It was very sweet.

816
00:32:37.854 --> 00:32:39.785
<v Voiceover>Thank you so much.</v>

817
00:32:39.785 --> 00:32:41.334
What an incredible journey

818
00:32:41.334 --> 00:32:44.171
and for putting it down in such a lovely style

819
00:32:44.171 --> 00:32:45.494
and sharing it with everyone.

820
00:32:45.494 --> 00:32:48.246
I started reading the book and by the second page

821
00:32:48.246 --> 00:32:50.411
I was completely grabbed

822
00:32:50.411 --> 00:32:51.669
<v ->Oh you're very sweet</v>

823
00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:53.899
<v ->Oh, I really wish you the best</v>

824
00:32:53.899 --> 00:32:55.936
and I hope you sell millions and millions of copies.

825
00:32:55.936 --> 00:32:57.464
Cause this is a story

826
00:32:57.464 --> 00:33:01.485
that I think everyone will feel inspired and comforted by .

827
00:33:01.485 --> 00:33:02.349
<v ->Thank you.</v>

828
00:33:02.349 --> 00:33:03.907
<v ->Thank you.</v>

829
00:33:05.237 --> 00:33:07.661
<v ->If you're interested in hearing her entire story,</v>

830
00:33:07.661 --> 00:33:11.106
pick up a copy of her book the Evidence for the Sixth Sense

831
00:33:11.106 --> 00:33:13.367
through her website HazelCourtney.com

832
00:33:13.367 --> 00:33:16.247
Meanwhile, to see how this picture all fits together

833
00:33:16.247 --> 00:33:18.264
check out the interview with Dr. Gary Schwartz as well

834
00:33:18.264 --> 00:33:20.164
if you haven't already.

835
00:33:20.164 --> 00:33:22.849
Until next time, thanks for watching.

836
00:33:22.849 --> 00:33:27.751
(light classical piano)
