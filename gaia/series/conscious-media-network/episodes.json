This transition occurred in the millennia from 10,000 to 5000 BC.","teaser":"Author, lecturer and guide, John Anthony West, discusses the evidence that suggests the Sphinx may have been built much earlier than previously thought.","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/716badbe-7af4-45fd-b67d-3e741f71e3e4?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/b452477d-ab10-46f7-af4c-45042a6d33b4?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/b452477d-ab10-46f7-af4c-45042a6d33b4?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/b452477d-ab10-46f7-af4c-45042a6d33b4?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"cast":"John Anthony West"},{"seriesId":35516,"seriesTitle":"Conscious Media Network","seriesPath":"series/conscious-media-network","seriesVoteDownCount":133,"seriesVoteUpCount":1441,"coverartImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/b55a391a-be13-4d65-9ee0-d5d2733ecfcb?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","created":"2006-11-01","episode":42,"classicFacets":{},"fitnessLevel":[],"fitnessStyle":[],"heroImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/ee2fd3ac-8931-4735-94e7-6d3d0fae0476?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","heroImageNotext":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/4b4d073e-bf58-435c-8c00-8d49debc07e4?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","host":"Regina Meredith","meditationStyle":null,"path":"video/robert-scaer-dealing-trauma","previewImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/b55a391a-be13-4d65-9ee0-d5d2733ecfcb?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","published":true,"season":2,"title":"Robert Scaer on Dealing with Trauma","type":{"content":"video","display":"normal","product":"episode"},"contentSubtype":"normal","references":[{"content_id":"26611","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"admin_category","language":"en","path":null,"name":"Personal Growth","weight":0},{"content_id":"207964","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"topic/health-healing","name":"Health & Healing","weight":1},{"content_id":"209270","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"genres","language":"en","path":"tag/archives","name":"Archives","weight":0},{"content_id":"28581","content_type":"person","reference_type":"interview-host","language":"en","path":"person/regina-meredith","name":"Regina Meredith","weight":0},{"content_id":"207734","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"rainbow-category","language":"en","path":"tag/1-health-healing-rc","name":"1 - Health & Healing RC","weight":0},{"content_id":"122190","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"site_segment","language":"en","path":"alternative-healing","name":"Alternative Healing","weight":1}],"voteDownCount":5,"voteUpCount":77,"yogaLevel":[],"yogaStyle":[],"episodeCount":310,"seasonCount":8,"preview":{"duration":45,"mediaId":28920,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"free","subscriptions":[]},"id":28920,"isFree":true},"feature":{"duration":2299,"mediaId":24914,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"onlyWith","subscriptions":[253,280,290]},"id":24914,"isFree":false},"id":24641,"isNew":false,"featuredType":null,"body":"Neurologist Dr. Robert Scaer author of The Trauma Spectrum: Hidden Wounds and Human Resiliency, discusses his book and the implications of childbirth and trauma.\r\n\r\nDr. Scaer explains that it is not necessarily large dramas that shape our life experience, but little, everyday traumas that impact all facets of our daily lives and inner experience.

Lester discovered that by releasing his non-love feelings his health improved, and that after 3 months he attained both renewed health and peace of mind, both of which lasted 42 years beyond his doctors’ expectations. From this state of mind and his work with people for 22-years, Levenson inspired the creation (in 1974) of what is now known as the Sedona Method.\r\n\r\nDwoskin immersed himself in the releasing process and developed a close relationship with Lester that lasted until Levenson’s death in 1994. Several years before his death, Lester transferred his copyrights to Hale and asked that he continue his work. Sedona Training Associates is the main vehicle for sharing Lester’s teachings with the world, and Hale has added over 28 years of experience and knowledge to the work.","teaser":"The Sedona Method, which has been validated by Harvard Medical School, enables you to release limiting thoughts and feelings that may have plagued you for years – even the first time you use the program – by addressing and releasing the thoughts and feelings at the root of a problem rather than treating symptoms.","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/b31b476a-99c1-49d7-a47b-55c4644843cc?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/eb6fd59f-d79b-4412-923d-a5c8e42cbf4c?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/eb6fd59f-d79b-4412-923d-a5c8e42cbf4c?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/eb6fd59f-d79b-4412-923d-a5c8e42cbf4c?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"cast":"Hale Dwoskin"},{"seriesId":35516,"seriesTitle":"Conscious Media Network","seriesPath":"series/conscious-media-network","seriesVoteDownCount":133,"seriesVoteUpCount":1441,"coverartImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/a499c2dc-0766-48f3-ab3f-b6feacd772c1?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","created":"2007-02-01","episode":6,"classicFacets":{},"fitnessLevel":[],"fitnessStyle":[],"heroImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/de00a2dd-e627-4060-8fc5-c51d29e4bc99?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","heroImageNotext":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/707ac1b7-d934-42f4-88ca-4774cb0d12ad?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","host":"Regina Meredith","meditationStyle":null,"path":"video/alex-grey-art-humanity","previewImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/a499c2dc-0766-48f3-ab3f-b6feacd772c1?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","published":true,"season":3,"title":"Alex Grey on The Art of Humanity","type":{"content":"video","display":"normal","product":"episode"},"contentSubtype":"normal","references":[{"content_id":"26619","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"admin_category","language":"en","path":"tag/art","name":"Art","weight":0},{"content_id":"207966","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"topic/spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","weight":1},{"content_id":"209270","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"genres","language":"en","path":"tag/archives","name":"Archives","weight":0},{"content_id":"28581","content_type":"person","reference_type":"interview-host","language":"en","path":"person/regina-meredith","name":"Regina Meredith","weight":0},{"content_id":"207737","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"rainbow-category","language":"en","path":"tag/4-spiritual-growth-rc","name":"4 -

He has given lectures, seminars, and training sessions in 24 countries, presenting papers and workshops at more than 40 national and international conferences.\nHis technique, known as the Gas Discharge Visualization technique (GDV), is a breakthrough beyond Kirlian photography for direct, real-time viewing of the human aura. This technology uses a special GDV camera to capture the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual energy emanating to and from human beings, plants, liquids, powders, and inanimate objects. It then translates this data into a computerized model. From this technique, Prof. Korotkov developed Electrophotonic Imaging (EPI), which permits a specialist to view human energy fields and monitor their well-being. This alternative and complementary medical technology was approved in Russia years ago.\nThe GDV technique is not only accepted by the Russian Ministry of Health as medical technology but with more than 300 doctors, practitioners, and researchers using this technology worldwide.

Mear explains that it’s not unlike a radio that you tune into a certain number on a dial to get a specific frequency in order to listen to a program. If that number is slightly off, all you get is static. If you can’t hear the program, you must adjust the number. More precisely, you need to adjust the healing numbers to improve the positive energy in your body.\nLloyd Mear was ahead of his time when he came to the understanding that each and every ailment, nutrient, emotion, and so forth, has its own frequency signified by a sequence of numbers or “healing code.” After years of research, he found that by reciting the correlative number for balancing a particular ailment, that the body would respond the same as with a physical antidote. It is, loosely speaking, a matter of energy healing by the numbers.

Instead, he became a professor, teaching at Cornell, alongside Carl Sagan, and later at Princeton in the Physics Department.

Are we a Darwinian evolutionary species or was there an intelligent design that has guided our evolution on this planet and is continuing to shape our future?

Although this is focused primarily towards women, the essence of what Christine says is applicable to all, especially teens and young adults who are indoctrinated by mainstream media messages of identity.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re in an intimate relationship or have chosen to go it alone, Christine encourages everyone to have a love affair with yourself, first.","teaser":"Whether you’re in an intimate relationship or have chosen to go it alone, Christine Arylo encourages everyone to have a love affair with yourself, first.","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/eb00cd7e-8a80-4989-a472-38d9b830610b?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/2a86f3c9-3c7b-426a-aa55-041a41790bf9?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/2a86f3c9-3c7b-426a-aa55-041a41790bf9?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/2a86f3c9-3c7b-426a-aa55-041a41790bf9?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"cast":"Christine Arylo "},{"seriesId":35516,"seriesTitle":"Conscious Media Network","seriesPath":"series/conscious-media-network","seriesVoteDownCount":133,"seriesVoteUpCount":1441,"coverartImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/ab591598-af92-40a3-b8b8-6148d803c7ce?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","created":"2012-02-01","episode":8,"classicFacets":{},"fitnessLevel":[],"fitnessStyle":[],"heroImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/5abb736b-cf6a-4faf-95ed-f31787a81aec?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","heroImageNotext":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/5813cac0-45c9-45fb-b91b-b883db41916b?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","host":"Regina Meredith","meditationStyle":null,"path":"video/foster-gamble-thrive-movement","previewImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/ab591598-af92-40a3-b8b8-6148d803c7ce?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","published":true,"season":8,"title":"Foster Gamble on the Thrive Movement","type":{"content":"video","display":"normal","product":"episode"},"contentSubtype":"normal","references":[{"content_id":"26618","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"admin_category","language":"en","path":null,"name":"Coverups","weight":0},{"content_id":"207966","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"topic/spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","weight":1},{"content_id":"209270","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"genres","language":"en","path":"tag/archives","name":"Archives","weight":0},{"content_id":"28581","content_type":"person","reference_type":"interview-host","language":"en","path":"person/regina-meredith","name":"Regina Meredith","weight":0},{"content_id":"207737","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"rainbow-category","language":"en","path":"tag/4-spiritual-growth-rc","name":"4 - Spiritual Growth RC","weight":0},{"content_id":"120016","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"site_segment","language":"en","path":"seeking-truth","name":"Seeking Truth","weight":1}],"voteDownCount":3,"voteUpCount":64,"yogaLevel":[],"yogaStyle":[],"episodeCount":310,"seasonCount":8,"preview":{"duration":51,"mediaId":28351,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"free","subscriptions":[]},"id":28351,"isFree":true},"feature":{"duration":2914,"mediaId":25198,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"onlyWith","subscriptions":[253,280,290]},"id":25198,"isFree":false},"id":24973,"isNew":false,"featuredType":null,"body":"Not all conspiracy theories about the new world are fake.
