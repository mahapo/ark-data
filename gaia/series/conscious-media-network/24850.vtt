00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Lorraine Day was chief
of orthopedics at San Francisco

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.030 align:middle line:84%
General Hospital, one of
the most prestigious trauma

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.630 align:middle line:90%
hospitals in America.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.680 align:middle line:84%
In addition, she was on the
faculty of UC San Francisco

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Medical School as a
professor and vice

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.110 align:middle line:84%
chairman of the department
of orthopedic surgery for 15

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:16.950 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.870 align:middle line:84%
But when she developed
severe cancer,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.660 align:middle line:84%
she knew the orthodox therapies
of chemotherapy, radiation,

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.220 align:middle line:84%
and mutilating surgery do not
cure cancer and frequently kill

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.810 align:middle line:90%
the patient who takes them.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Instead, she chose to get well
by rebuilding her immune system

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.480 align:middle line:90%
with totally natural therapies.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Through her search
for medical truth,

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.550 align:middle line:84%
she learned that vaccinations,
all vaccinations,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.610 align:middle line:84%
not only don't
work, but they also

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.655 align:middle line:84%
have terribly damaging, even
life threatening, side effects.

00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:54.380 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Things have ratcheted
up a bit since we talked

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.638 align:middle line:90%
to you a couple of years ago.

00:00:57.638 --> 00:00:58.438 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:00:58.438 --> 00:00:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody knows that.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.825 align:middle line:84%
And You and I have been
talking off camera.

00:01:02.825 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
really important

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.780 align:middle line:84%
to start with the
Iron Mountain Report

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.350 align:middle line:84%
because we're looking at ways
in which the human population is

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.200 align:middle line:84%
being absolutely decimated
in terms of our health

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.970 align:middle line:90%
from every front and angle.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Forget what's happening even
economically and otherwise

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.095 align:middle line:84%
in the fear that's
being created.

00:01:19.095 --> 00:01:20.460 align:middle line:90%
Our health is dying.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.320 align:middle line:84%
We're, as a species, living
in fear and running ragged.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.210 align:middle line:84%
So you say that a lot
of this dates back

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.980 align:middle line:84%
to this report, the Iron
Mountain Report in the 1970s.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.120 align:middle line:84%
This is the book, Report
from Iron Mountain

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.110 align:middle line:84%
on the Possibility and
Desirability of Peace.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.680 align:middle line:84%
You hear a lot about peace
now and the disarmament

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.310 align:middle line:84%
and how they want to make sure
that countries are disarmed.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And they want to disarm
the citizens because we're

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.790 align:middle line:90%
going to have peace.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, for thousands
of years, rulers

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.940 align:middle line:84%
have kept their
subjects under control

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.010 align:middle line:84%
by putting fear
into their heart.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's been done in
America from the beginning.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.240 align:middle line:84%
There's always
going to be a war,

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.000 align:middle line:84%
or there's some kind of virus
coming from someplace else.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore,
everybody is afraid.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And they will do what
the government wants them

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.870 align:middle line:90%
to do or give up their rights.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Illuminati
and the people

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.110 align:middle line:84%
who are ruling
this planet decided

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.440 align:middle line:90%
that they had to get together.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And when they are able
to successfully disarm

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.060 align:middle line:84%
all nations, then they're
going to have peace.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, how do you keep the
subjects under control?

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.820 align:middle line:84%
How do you keep the
people down on the farm

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.338 align:middle line:90%
when you don't have this threat?

00:02:32.338 --> 00:02:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, when peace breaks out.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, when peace breaks out,
when you don't have an invading

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.350 align:middle line:90%
army.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.530 align:middle line:90%
So they got together.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
qualifications-- and I

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.315 align:middle line:84%
will say that I think this
is available on the internet.

00:02:44.315 --> 00:02:45.690 align:middle line:84%
You can get this
on the internet.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.898 align:middle line:90%
>> Report from Iron Mountain.

00:02:46.898 --> 00:02:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Report from Iron Mountain.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.060 align:middle line:90%
And so they came together.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And one critical factor
that each one had to have

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.130 align:middle line:84%
was that they had to
have no conscience.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.972 align:middle line:90%
That's a frightening thing.

00:02:59.972 --> 00:03:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And that says
that in that book?

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.557 align:middle line:90%
>> That's part of the criteria.

00:03:03.557 --> 00:03:04.640 align:middle line:90%
>> You have no conscience.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.850 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you cannot
consider the suffering

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:08.840 align:middle line:90%
of people.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.230 align:middle line:84%
You cannot consider
maiming and killing people.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.380 align:middle line:84%
That cannot bother you in
order to be a member of this

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:84%
committee and make the
decisions that have to be made.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, Bertrand Russell said that
a long time ago in his book,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.150 align:middle line:84%
where he said that a
virus should go around

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.690 align:middle line:84%
the world at least once every 10
years to kill enough people so

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.340 align:middle line:90%
that people could procreate.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said we should have
them die a horrible death.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And he said, that shouldn't
bother anybody, especially

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.640 align:middle line:84%
those of us who are not going
to be affected by this, you see.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So they had to have
a backup plan, then,

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.210 align:middle line:84%
because the disarmament,
it appears on many levels

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.450 align:middle line:90%
as beginning to happen.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>> They're attempting it.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So they had to say, what are
we going to have to frighten

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.450 align:middle line:90%
the people?

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.330 align:middle line:84%
What is going to be the
common enemy that we can

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.670 align:middle line:90%
keep putting before the people?

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And they came up with
environmentalism,

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.600 align:middle line:84%
that the people are
destroying the planet.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to decrease
the population in order

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.630 align:middle line:90%
to save the planet.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, Al Gore is all
involved in this.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And Al Gore is part
of the Illuminati.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.260 align:middle line:84%
His father was a
business partner

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.640 align:middle line:84%
of Arm & Hammer,
who was a communist

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and the liaison between
the US and Russia

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.820 align:middle line:84%
but was really an infiltrator
and was part of the bad guys.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.940 align:middle line:84%
So they decided that they have
to start scaring the people.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing
now ads on television

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.180 align:middle line:84%
about globalism, how we
have to protect the planet.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not against
protecting the planet.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.310 align:middle line:84%
But they want people to
start committing suicide.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.580 align:middle line:84%
They started talking
about a carbon tax.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, the carbon
tax for emissions,

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.420 align:middle line:84%
supposedly, but you have to
realize that when you breathe,

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.780 align:middle line:84%
you breathe in oxygen. And
guess what you breathe out?

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.070 align:middle line:90%
Carbon dioxide.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the way God created
the Earth because the plants

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.490 align:middle line:90%
then use the carbon dioxide.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And they put oxygen back
into the atmosphere.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.040 align:middle line:84%
But these people
who want us dead

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.510 align:middle line:90%
don't want to consider that.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.230 align:middle line:84%
They want to tell you that
you can breathe for so long,

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.895 align:middle line:84%
and then when you've used up
all the time that you have,

00:05:23.895 --> 00:05:25.520 align:middle line:84%
and you're putting
out too much carbon,

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.478 align:middle line:84%
that you should somehow
self-destruct or commit

00:05:27.478 --> 00:05:28.980 align:middle line:90%
suicide or something like that.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Or you can be helped along.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Can be helped along.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.350 align:middle line:84%
But they are training
children in the school

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:90%
to think this way.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.490 align:middle line:84%
That's one reason that the
suicide rate is going up so

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.710 align:middle line:90%
rapidly in teenagers.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:40.920 align:middle line:90%
They are being trained.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.570 align:middle line:84%
They are being asked
to write essays on how

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.190 align:middle line:90%
they would kill themselves.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.610 align:middle line:84%
They are asked to write
essays on how they're

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.660 align:middle line:90%
destroying the environment.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And so this is being
schooled into these children.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Actually, I've seen this.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.830 align:middle line:84%
I've been made aware through
circles of girlfriends

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.800 align:middle line:84%
who have children that
the popular trend is

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.110 align:middle line:90%
cutting and attempting suicide.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>> It's popular to do this.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I actually wasn't
aware of that.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And it put it in my face
because their daughters

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.960 align:middle line:84%
have been in and out
of the emergency room.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So somehow it's being made
to be tragically depressed

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.630 align:middle line:90%
and so forth is being made chic.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.850 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And killing yourself
is being made

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.690 align:middle line:84%
chic because you're
doing the planet a favor

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:30.800 align:middle line:90%
by killing yourself.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.840 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're
breeding into your mind

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.170 align:middle line:90%
with these young people.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway, they
decided on environmentalism

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.240 align:middle line:84%
as being the great
bogeyman to scare people.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore,
we've got to have

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.740 align:middle line:90%
a decrease in the amount of--

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>> To justify--

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>> --food that people
are going to have to eat.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's not bad when
whole populations

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.090 align:middle line:84%
are being wiped out because
that's saving the Earth.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And the animals are just
as important as humans.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And they have just as
much right to live here.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And they're not fouling
the Earth as humans are.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, the people who are
really following the Earth

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:13.340 align:middle line:84%
are these same Illuminati people
who have all these production

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.670 align:middle line:84%
companies that are belching
smoke and fumes and everything

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.780 align:middle line:90%
else into the air.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.640 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones
that you will notice,

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.010 align:middle line:84%
they never want to
start with depopulation

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.780 align:middle line:90%
by killing themselves.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:24.980 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.407 align:middle line:84%
I have always suggested,
well, if Al Gore thinks

00:07:27.407 --> 00:07:29.240 align:middle line:84%
that there are too many
people on the Earth,

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.970 align:middle line:84%
then maybe Al Gore
should be first to go.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:36.790 align:middle line:84%
But never Kissinger and Al Gore
and Bill Clinton and Hillary--

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.200 align:middle line:84%
they never consider
themselves as first

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.860 align:middle line:84%
to go because they consider
themselves special.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of us they
call useless eaters

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.270 align:middle line:90%
or the disgusting public.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, this came--

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:49.985 align:middle line:90%
we were talking about this.

00:07:49.985 --> 00:07:51.110 align:middle line:90%
And I've heard this before.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.240 align:middle line:84%
I think George Green
mentioned it in an interview

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.470 align:middle line:90%
but didn't source it.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.700 align:middle line:84%
But you actually have the
source of that information.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.540 align:middle line:84%
For the useless
eaters, that was given

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:04.640 align:middle line:84%
by Bertrand Russell in his
book, which I have, which is--

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.990 align:middle line:84%
I have the name of it on
the tip of my tongue--

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.840 align:middle line:84%
which has, by the way, been
taken out of all libraries now.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I had a
hard time finding it.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And I would not
quote it until I was

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.600 align:middle line:90%
able to find a copy of the book.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.930 align:middle line:84%
But it's being taken out
of all the major libraries.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:23.030 align:middle line:10%
And then the book about
the disgusting public--

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:10%
they call us the
disgusting public--

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.510 align:middle line:10%
is in this book, Top Secret:
Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars,

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:33.679 align:middle line:10%
which is a CIA training manual.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And you can find this
on the website as well.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>> World War III declared.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.960 align:middle line:10%
Top Secret: Silent
Weapons for Quiet Wars.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.909 align:middle line:84%
And it shows how the
population is being programmed.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And it shows the
formulas they are using.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And they have found
that it's just as easy

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.850 align:middle line:84%
to program a public
around the world

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.960 align:middle line:84%
as it is to program a computer
or to program a machine

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.170 align:middle line:90%
or to program a production line.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.390 align:middle line:84%
They can program it
with the same things.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And one reason they
do so many surveys

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.590 align:middle line:84%
to try to find out what
people are thinking is it's

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:07.790 align:middle line:90%
all part of the programming.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.050 align:middle line:90%
They do something.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:12.767 align:middle line:84%
And then they do a survey to see
how people are reacting to it.

00:09:12.767 --> 00:09:15.350 align:middle line:84%
Some of the things that they do,
some of the outrageous things

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.780 align:middle line:84%
they do, are just
part of this plan

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:23.780 align:middle line:84%
to try to see how they can
program the public, you see.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So this is an amazing
book where they

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.640 align:middle line:84%
show how they have programmed
parents to actually

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.980 align:middle line:84%
happily send their children that
they love very much off to war

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:35.780 align:middle line:90%
to be killed.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I've never understood
that one, either.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't get it.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And they show here-- they
actually ridicule the parents

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:46.400 align:middle line:84%
who do it, behind
their backs, of course.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.560 align:middle line:84%
But how they have
programmed the public

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.560 align:middle line:84%
to actually accept this--
and the father, of course,

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.360 align:middle line:84%
is proud of his son
going off to war.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.860 align:middle line:84%
It's a manly thing
to do-- when he's

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.180 align:middle line:90%
sending him off to his death.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And so that people
don't understand

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.860 align:middle line:90%
how much they're programmed.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.650 align:middle line:84%
People are programmed
because all of this

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.440 align:middle line:84%
is coming in-- it's
coming in from everywhere.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.110 align:middle line:84%
It's coming in
from the churches.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.210 align:middle line:90%
It's coming in from the schools.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.510 align:middle line:84%
It's coming in from television
of which people sit in front

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.032 align:middle line:90%
of for hours every day.

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll tell you where
it's also coming--

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:18.620 align:middle line:90%
the movie theaters.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.960 align:middle line:84%
The propaganda for
violence and war--

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.120 align:middle line:84%
you're a rock star
if you go to war now.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
never go to movies.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:28.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't go to movies
because I can tell you

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.870 align:middle line:84%
there is so much
programming in the movies.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.210 align:middle line:84%
There is so much
programming in television.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.750 align:middle line:90%
There's programming in the news.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And so they are constantly
programming the public.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And they are also
assaulting the public

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.930 align:middle line:84%
with all of this terrible
stuff that's going on

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.910 align:middle line:90%
until people get desensitized.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And they don't even
think about how

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.370 align:middle line:84%
it is, what we're doing
in Iraq and Afghanistan

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.950 align:middle line:84%
and Sudan and all
these other places,

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:84%
where we're just
slaughtering these people who

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.450 align:middle line:90%
never did anything to us.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So they're trying to
decrease the population.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing it
in many, many ways.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And one way is
birth control, which

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:10.850 align:middle line:84%
is, of course, an acceptable
way to many, many people.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.280 align:middle line:84%
But that decreases the
population immensely.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.590 align:middle line:90%
Another one is abortion.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.530 align:middle line:90%
Another one is infanticide.

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:22.795 align:middle line:84%
When a child is
aborted and survives,

00:11:22.795 --> 00:11:24.420 align:middle line:84%
they don't try to
make that child live.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.460 align:middle line:84%
They put that child
aside, even in the best

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.260 align:middle line:90%
of hospitals in America.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.720 align:middle line:84%
They put that child--
and let it die.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.280 align:middle line:90%
That's infanticide.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.890 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
even start suggesting

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:39.690 align:middle line:84%
that four months
after a child is born,

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.390 align:middle line:84%
if it is found to
have a defect, they're

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:46.590 align:middle line:84%
trying to get laws passed that
you can just kill the child

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:50.760 align:middle line:90%
or let it die in America.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.460 align:middle line:90%
Just outright infanticide.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Partial birth abortion
is really infanticide

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.400 align:middle line:84%
because it's abortion
done at maturity.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.510 align:middle line:90%
Too late a stage.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And so they're
doing that, really,

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.240 align:middle line:84%
to provide themselves
with a whole business,

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:12.480 align:middle line:84%
which is organ donations from
babies and baby parts to use

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:18.180 align:middle line:84%
for various other research or
supposedly treatment of certain

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:18.990 align:middle line:90%
diseases.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And so they need a
ready supply of that.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.800 align:middle line:84%
So what they do is, the
child is actually born alive,

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.900 align:middle line:90%
everything except the head.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And then they stick an
instrument in the brain

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:31.428 align:middle line:90%
and kill the child.

00:12:31.428 --> 00:12:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And so then they
bring the child out.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:34.130 align:middle line:90%
It's fresh.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.310 align:middle line:90%
It's just newly dead.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And they take the
parts right away.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:41.250 align:middle line:84%
This is done for nothing
but absolute greed

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:44.280 align:middle line:84%
because they get huge amounts
of money for these baby parts.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Even though they're not supposed
to charge for them, they do.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Can we go from right in there
because it blends with it,

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.990 align:middle line:90%
the human papillomavirus?

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:57.540 align:middle line:84%
The human papillomavirus--
well, vaccines in general--

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.040 align:middle line:84%
maybe we can get
to those right now.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Vaccines in general
are meant to kill.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:03.332 align:middle line:90%
They are not safe.

00:13:03.332 --> 00:13:04.290 align:middle line:90%
They are not effective.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:05.530 align:middle line:90%
They do not work.

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:08.040 align:middle line:90%
They don't work at all.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.980 align:middle line:90%
They don't work at all.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And they have all sorts
of terrible things

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:14.160 align:middle line:84%
in them-- mercury and
various other things.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Plus, some of them are grown
in chicken cells, human cancer

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.770 align:middle line:90%
cell lines.

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.670 align:middle line:84%
So when they're grown in these
cells and other kinds of animal

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:28.530 align:middle line:84%
cells, you get all the
contamination of that animal,

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.410 align:middle line:84%
plus all the diseases
that that animal can have.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
in the laboratory

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.590 align:middle line:90%
are fed with fetal calf serum.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:38.518 align:middle line:90%
I know because I--

00:13:38.518 --> 00:13:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>> You've been in the business.

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.185 align:middle line:84%
>> --have done a
lot of research.

00:13:41.185 --> 00:13:42.030 align:middle line:90%
And I have used--

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.270 align:middle line:84%
they bring in fetal calf
serum by the hundreds

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:48.420 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of bottles
into UC San Francisco

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.120 align:middle line:84%
and every other medical
school because everybody

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.960 align:middle line:90%
uses that to feed the cells.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.840 align:middle line:90%
The cells have to stay alive.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is from the serum
from unborn baby calves.

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.650 align:middle line:90%
But we have mad cow disease.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.830 align:middle line:84%
They say, oh, well, that doesn't
show up until the cow is older.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.470 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean
when it shows up.

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:14.460 align:middle line:84%
These babies can have the
contamination of the prions.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And so we're putting
that in everything.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And then that is injected
into you or your child.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, would you say that some
of this is malevolent in nature

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.620 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the types of
things that are put in there?

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Or is it all done out of
ignorance, shall we say,

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.350 align:middle line:84%
used as preservatives
and the like?

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't think it
was put together malevolently

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.170 align:middle line:90%
originally.

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors are not
necessarily evil people

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.580 align:middle line:90%
because they give vaccinations.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.140 align:middle line:90%
The doctors don't know.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.790 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:50.090 align:middle line:84%
But the doctors don't
want to know, either.

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors
are just the dupes

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.360 align:middle line:84%
of the pharmaceutical
industry who

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.270 align:middle line:84%
want to make a lot of money
off of these vaccines,

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:02.000 align:middle line:90%
as well as depopulate the Earth.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.320 align:middle line:84%
The doctors aren't in on the
idea of depopulating the Earth.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.580 align:middle line:84%
They are the stupid
dupes who willingly

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.300 align:middle line:84%
do the dirty work
for the Illuminati

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.970 align:middle line:84%
who are all involved at the
top with the pharmaceutical

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:17.930 align:middle line:90%
companies.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Because you see, the
pharmaceutical companies

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:25.760 align:middle line:84%
make more off of vaccines
than off of regular drugs.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.430 align:middle line:84%
It is the biggest
moneymaker of all time.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And now a child, before
they go to school,

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:36.540 align:middle line:84%
has to have about 40
vaccines given to them.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Another very interesting aspect
of vaccinations is that--

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.480 align:middle line:90%
we all know--

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.420 align:middle line:84%
everybody knows that's
in the medical industry,

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.490 align:middle line:84%
knows that vaccines
are contaminated.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.070 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you put
the actual virus in it.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you inject the
virus into somebody's body,

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:53.020 align:middle line:90%
they can get the disease.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.090 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole point.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:54.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And so when
these contaminants--

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.820 align:middle line:84%
if you take a contaminant
that's called non-pathogenic,

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:06.470 align:middle line:84%
which means it doesn't normally
cause disease in a human

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.080 align:middle line:90%
being--

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:13.120 align:middle line:84%
if you inject that, or let's
say you do experimental animals,

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:17.080 align:middle line:84%
and you inject a non-pathogenic
organism that does not

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:21.400 align:middle line:84%
cause disease in this
particular type of animal,

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.650 align:middle line:90%
and they will not get a disease.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.480 align:middle line:84%
If you take another
group of animals,

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.610 align:middle line:84%
and you inject a non-pathogenic
different one in those

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:90%
animals--

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.100 align:middle line:84%
these are ones that
could be in vaccines--

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.690 align:middle line:84%
they will not get
disease, either.

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:39.100 align:middle line:84%
But if you combine those
two, and inject them

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:43.070 align:middle line:84%
into a third group,
they all get disease.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:47.050 align:middle line:84%
So when you are combining
these contaminants that are

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:50.420 align:middle line:84%
in the vaccines-- plus, you're
putting many vaccines together,

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:54.940 align:middle line:84%
like in a measles,
mumps, and rubella MMR--

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.280 align:middle line:90%
you are raising havoc.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.920 align:middle line:90%
And it's killing children.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.990 align:middle line:84%
SIDS is primarily
caused by vaccinations.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.329 align:middle line:84%
It can also be
caused by the mother

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:10.099 align:middle line:84%
having smoked while
she was pregnant.

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And autism is almost
totally caused--

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:12.038 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:12.038 --> 00:17:13.413 align:middle line:84%
I was just going
to ask you that.

00:17:13.413 --> 00:17:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>> --because of the mercury,
which is a heavy metal,

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.579 align:middle line:84%
which causes brain
damage to the child.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:23.506 align:middle line:84%
And these vaccines are
given before the baby even

00:17:23.506 --> 00:17:24.339 align:middle line:90%
leaves the hospital.

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:25.960 align:middle line:90%
And they have no immune system.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.350 align:middle line:84%
They're giving hepatitis
B vaccines to a baby

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.300 align:middle line:90%
before they leave the hospital.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:38.170 align:middle line:84%
The incidence of hepatitis
B in the general population

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:41.860 align:middle line:84%
of adults is less
than 5%, except in

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.700 align:middle line:84%
the homosexual community,
where it's about 85% to 90%.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's only less than
5% in the adult community.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.540 align:middle line:84%
In babies, hepatitis
B is essentially zero.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:56.680 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason to give
these babies these vaccines.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Even if they worked,
there's no reason.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.600 align:middle line:90%
It's called killing.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.580 align:middle line:84%
With the Gardasil, human
papilloma virus-- first of all,

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.950 align:middle line:84%
there is something more than
just the human papilloma virus

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:10.945 align:middle line:90%
that causes cervical cancer.

00:18:10.945 --> 00:18:14.620 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:18.220 align:middle line:84%
The more sexual
partners a woman has,

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:22.060 align:middle line:84%
the more risk she is at
getting cervical cancer.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.560 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
whether she's ever

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:27.610 align:middle line:84%
been exposed to HPV,
which she probably will.

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:30.400 align:middle line:84%
But it only supposedly
even protects

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.070 align:middle line:84%
for about three
strains of HPV, when

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.470 align:middle line:90%
there are something like 16.

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And so instead of saying-- first
of all, there are many other

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.830 align:middle line:84%
sexually transmitted diseases
that a sexually active person

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:48.550 align:middle line:84%
can get besides human
papilloma virus.

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So even if HPV vaccine
did work, they're

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.903 align:middle line:84%
encouraging everybody
to have sex.

00:18:56.903 --> 00:18:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And so then they're
getting contaminated

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.640 align:middle line:84%
with all these other
things as well, which can

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.660 align:middle line:90%
cause all sorts of problems.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And so when they encourage
HPV, what they're really doing

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:10.540 align:middle line:90%
is they're causing infertility.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.820 align:middle line:90%
And that is their approach.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.550 align:middle line:84%
That is their goal
because infertility--

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>> What is it in that vaccine
that causes the infertility

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:22.630 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to another vaccine?

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all, I think
almost all the vaccines cause

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.810 align:middle line:90%
infertility.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:30.020 align:middle line:84%
So I can't tell you what is
specifically in that vaccine.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:34.090 align:middle line:84%
But we do know that these
vaccines cause infertility.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:34.912 align:middle line:90%
We do know that.

00:19:34.912 --> 00:19:36.370 align:middle line:84%
But there are a
lot of other things

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:38.110 align:middle line:90%
that cause infertility, too.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.600 align:middle line:90%
Fluoride in the water--

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.040 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about fluoride.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.370 align:middle line:90%
A lot of devastating effects.

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot of devastating effects.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:48.220 align:middle line:84%
First of all, fluoride in the
water causes brain damage,

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.020 align:middle line:90%
contributes to Alzheimer's.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.450 align:middle line:90%
Fluoride causes brittle bones.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:56.300 align:middle line:84%
So people get
fractures more easily.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And in the elderly, they
get a fracture, a hip.

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:01.390 align:middle line:90%
They frequently get pneumonia.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's a big cause of
death in the elderly.

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:06.560 align:middle line:90%
Fluoride causes premature aging.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.790 align:middle line:84%
It causes the skin to
become brittle and wrinkle.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:12.700 align:middle line:84%
It causes the same thing
to happen to your organs.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And fluoride causes suppression
of the frontal lobes, where you

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.580 align:middle line:90%
make your judgment decisions.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Fluoride is a main component
of some of the anesthetics

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.680 align:middle line:90%
we use in the operating room.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.535 align:middle line:84%
>> And you told me off-camera
that there was actually a slang

00:20:27.535 --> 00:20:28.660 align:middle line:90%
term in the operating room.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.340 align:middle line:84%
One of these fluoride components
that's in an anesthetic

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:34.750 align:middle line:90%
causes people to be really sick.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And we would always
call it fluoro-barf.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.060 align:middle line:84%
But fluoride is in
a lot of things.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And when young people
drink all these sodas,

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.140 align:middle line:84%
that's made with
fluoridated water.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.530 align:middle line:90%
The fluoride is in these sodas.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.900 align:middle line:84%
They're drinking fluoride
over and over again.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they drink
64 ounces of these things

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:53.920 align:middle line:90%
or more a day.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.950 align:middle line:84%
The fluoride is in the
water that they put

00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:00.700 align:middle line:90%
in processed foods, in soups.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's chlorine, too.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And chlorine is a poisonous
gas that's in the water.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.560 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to chlorinate
the water to purify it.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.830 align:middle line:90%
They could ozonate it.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And then it would cause
no problems whatsoever.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.660 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Los Angeles
does ozonate their water.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:17.980 align:middle line:90%
That's the way they purify it.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.580 align:middle line:84%
But then when it goes out in
the pipes, it gets contaminated.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:25.042 align:middle line:84%
So at the end source,
they chlorinate it again.

00:21:25.042 --> 00:21:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Why don't they
ozonate it again?

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's right.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.810 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:32.140 align:middle line:90%
So just fluoride in the water--

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:35.400 align:middle line:84%
fluoride does not
decrease cavities.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.200 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.740 align:middle line:84%
It's been shown not
to decrease cavities.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Fluoride is a byproduct
of aluminum production.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.130 align:middle line:84%
It was put in the water to
get rid of this byproduct

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:47.650 align:middle line:84%
that they would have to pay
to get rid of otherwise.

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:48.940 align:middle line:90%
So they put it in the water.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And they propagandized
the people

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.770 align:middle line:84%
to think that it's good for
you and that it will help you.

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:55.150 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't help you.

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And when fluoride was
first put in the water,

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:01.790 align:middle line:84%
every dental association
in America was against it.

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:04.090 align:middle line:84%
But they infiltrated
the dental associations.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And now the dentists all
think it's a good thing.

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.060 align:middle line:84%
They have been brainwashed
to believe that this is OK.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.630 align:middle line:84%
If you look at your
toothpaste tube--

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:13.670 align:middle line:90%
if you look at that--

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:84%
there's a warning on it, a
death warning on the tube.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Nobody ever looks at it.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a death warning that
says, if a child swallows

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.960 align:middle line:84%
the amount of toothpaste
that is on the brush

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.330 align:middle line:84%
that they brush their
teeth with, they can die.

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:31.150 align:middle line:90%
Children have died from that.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Children have died
in the dental chair

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:37.660 align:middle line:84%
having fluoride
put on their teeth.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.930 align:middle line:84%
But this is never made
public because they

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.140 align:middle line:84%
want people to drink
fluoride in their water,

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.840 align:middle line:84%
have it in their toothpaste
because guess what it does?

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.750 align:middle line:84%
It dumbs down the
population so they're not

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.130 align:middle line:90%
able to think as well.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.200 align:middle line:84%
They don't care as much
what happens to them.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Their rights are all
being taken away.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
in a zombie state.

00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.980 align:middle line:90%
Give them all their sports.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.150 align:middle line:90%
Give them their beer.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:04.750 align:middle line:84%
The beer is made with
fluoridated water.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:07.300 align:middle line:84%
So people are taking in
huge amounts of fluoride.

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And now they're even increasing
the amount of fluoride

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:11.290 align:middle line:90%
that they say is acceptable.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:15.460 align:middle line:84%
The original one part per
million was not acceptable.

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Now it's up to, I don't know,
five or something else parts

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.620 align:middle line:90%
per million, which is deadly.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Something that easy-- it is
mass medication of the public.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's done to
dumb down the public,

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:32.260 align:middle line:84%
as if the public schools
weren't bad enough.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:35.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's another
way that they're

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.690 align:middle line:90%
causing population control.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:40.300 align:middle line:90%
They have planned famines.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:46.300 align:middle line:84%
You've heard about the
growing areas in America

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:49.030 align:middle line:84%
are being wiped out,
first with floods and then

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:52.870 align:middle line:90%
with heat waves.

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:54.140 align:middle line:90%
And how are they doing that?

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.080 align:middle line:84%
They're doing it
with weather control.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>> You're talking HAARP and some
of these other technologies.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>> HAARP, yeah.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:01.510 align:middle line:84%
All the technologies
with the scalar waves.

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:02.920 align:middle line:90%
And so they can wipe--

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:07.090 align:middle line:84%
they can take these
wonderfully rich growing areas

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:08.680 align:middle line:90%
and turn them into deserts.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.050 align:middle line:90%
And then they buy them up.

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Virtually all the
food-growing areas in America

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:15.080 align:middle line:90%
owned by three companies.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.660 align:middle line:90%
One is the Conagra.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.400 align:middle line:84%
The other is Archer
Daniels Midland.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.660 align:middle line:90%
And there's a third one.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And these are all owned
by Illuminati people.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.970 align:middle line:90%
So they're planning famines.

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:27.607 align:middle line:84%
And one reason-- when you
go to the grocery store

00:24:27.607 --> 00:24:29.440 align:middle line:84%
and they say, well,
what's your card number?

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.940 align:middle line:84%
Can we swipe in your card so
you get a good deal on these?

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.430 align:middle line:84%
They're tracking
everything you're

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:37.030 align:middle line:84%
eating so they know what to
withhold from you to sign you

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:39.460 align:middle line:90%
up for the new world order.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:41.590 align:middle line:84%
So I don't use a
grocery store card.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.412 align:middle line:84%
I figure, God will
take care of me.

00:24:43.412 --> 00:24:44.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't want that extra deal.

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Why are they giving you
such a deal with money?

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.440 align:middle line:90%
To suck you in.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>> When they're literally
robbing you of your health

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.520 align:middle line:90%
and your mental faculties.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And so then we've got
also weather modification.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Katrina was clearly
part of weather control.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>> That was HAARP all the way.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And they could
have kept that out.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:10.073 align:middle line:84%
They had the technology to have
kept Katrina right offshore.

00:25:10.073 --> 00:25:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>> They can make them.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.040 align:middle line:90%
And they can deflate them.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.290 align:middle line:90%
And so that's all part of it.

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:16.440 align:middle line:90%
And they can do that with--

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.100 align:middle line:90%
they say it's an act of God.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.580 align:middle line:90%
They bring in the rain.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:24.000 align:middle line:84%
First, they bring
in the hot weather.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.800 align:middle line:90%
Dry it out.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.300 align:middle line:90%
Then they bring in the flooding.

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And then the houses
slide down the hill.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And so they can do all
that with weather control.

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:33.650 align:middle line:84%
That's part of
population control.

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
we have street drugs.

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:38.740 align:middle line:90%
And we have medicinal drugs.

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, medicinal drugs
kills far more people

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.590 align:middle line:90%
than street drugs do.

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Street drugs is a
small part of deaths.

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:50.330 align:middle line:90%
Very, very small part.

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the largest
cause of death in America

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.080 align:middle line:90%
is what we call iatrogenic.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Iatrogenic is a two-bit word,
which means it's doctor-done.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:07.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at the
complications of surgery,

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.960 align:middle line:84%
the infections acquired
in the hospital,

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and the deaths from
drugs prescribed

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:17.440 align:middle line:84%
by doctors, that's the largest
group of deaths in America.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Hands down.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>> But we don't
outlaw doctors, do we?

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:22.930 align:middle line:90%
Want to outlaw guns.

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.690 align:middle line:84%
But we don't want to outlaw
doctors because doctors kill

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.280 align:middle line:90%
a lot more people than guns.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>> They're very effective.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, just as
a personal aside,

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.680 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend who
just lost her son who

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.360 align:middle line:90%
had been in a car accident.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.580 align:middle line:90%
And he was recovering nicely.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:38.740 align:middle line:90%
Healthy, young-- mid-20s.

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And they gave him some drugs
that interacted, and he's dead.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.570 align:middle line:90%
And she's devastated.

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:44.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean, beyond devastated.

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The worst place to be when
you're sick is in a hospital

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.170 align:middle line:84%
because all of these
terrible things can happen.

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:55.390 align:middle line:84%
You can get huge numbers of
infections in the hospital.

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And antibiotics will turn
out to be the greatest

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.410 align:middle line:90%
scourge of mankind.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Antibiotics-- because
then people say,

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:05.300 align:middle line:84%
well, I can eat, live, and
handle stress any way I want.

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And if I get sick, I'll just
go and get an antibiotic.

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:08.940 align:middle line:90%
I'll get a quick fix.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.840 align:middle line:84%
But the antibiotics
have turned on humanity.

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And the organisms, the bugs,
the bacteria and viruses

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:18.860 align:middle line:84%
are becoming
stronger and stronger

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:23.210 align:middle line:84%
because actually, bacteria
and viruses are our friends.

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:24.890 align:middle line:90%
They are our friends.

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:29.000 align:middle line:84%
God has a cleanup
crew at every level.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.280 align:middle line:84%
The vultures eat the
dead animals in the road

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.290 align:middle line:90%
to clean up the Earth.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:39.350 align:middle line:84%
The maggots eat
dead garbage piles.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And the insects and
the flies come in.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:45.830 align:middle line:84%
You will notice that
the garbage attracts

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:49.620 align:middle line:84%
the flies and the maggots,
not the other way around.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.220 align:middle line:84%
The dead animal in the
road attracts the vulture.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:54.890 align:middle line:84%
The vulture does not
attract the dead animal.

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Bacteria and viruses
are all around us.

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:00.510 align:middle line:90%


00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:01.510 align:middle line:90%
They're all on our skin.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:02.343 align:middle line:90%
They're in our nose.

00:28:02.343 --> 00:28:03.260 align:middle line:90%
They're in our mouth.

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And they're in our
gastrointestinal tract.

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And they have a real
reason for being there.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.240 align:middle line:90%
They help produce vitamin B12.

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.820 align:middle line:84%
What we call them
is normal flora.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.410 align:middle line:90%
And they're good bacteria.

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:18.500 align:middle line:84%
But when you take antibiotics,
it upsets everything.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And your intestine
does not work properly.

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And you have overgrowth
of bad bacteria or fungi

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:29.510 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And so when your cells
are sick and dying,

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:36.200 align:middle line:84%
these bacteria that
are in the environment

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.440 align:middle line:84%
move in to clean up
the dead material.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.650 align:middle line:84%
But when they clean up the
dead material in your body

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:44.990 align:middle line:84%
and throw the toxins
into your bloodstream,

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:47.780 align:middle line:84%
you may get a fever
or a runny nose.

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.220 align:middle line:90%
And then you are uncomfortable.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.858 align:middle line:90%
So you go to the doctor.

00:28:51.858 --> 00:28:53.150 align:middle line:90%
And guess what the doctor does?

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:54.590 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we've got to stop these.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.000 align:middle line:84%
We've got to kill
these bacteria.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.840 align:middle line:90%
So we'll give you antibiotics.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, the whole point is,
your body is full of garbage.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.295 align:middle line:84%
And the bacteria and viruses
were cleaning up your body.

00:29:04.295 --> 00:29:05.420 align:middle line:90%
And now you've killed them.

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.020 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like killing
the ambulance attendant who

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.980 align:middle line:84%
is trying to put you
into the ambulance

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.410 align:middle line:84%
to take you to the hospital
after you've been run over

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:13.490 align:middle line:90%
by a car.

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:14.480 align:middle line:90%
Oh, let's see.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.310 align:middle line:90%
This man is injured.

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:19.310 align:middle line:84%
This other man in a
white coat is near him.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:20.300 align:middle line:90%
He must have done it.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.110 align:middle line:90%
So let's kill him.

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
antibiotics are all about.

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:26.450 align:middle line:90%
If you look at the word anti--

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:28.520 align:middle line:90%
bio means life.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.310 align:middle line:90%
These are anti-life.

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:32.210 align:middle line:90%
And they harm us.

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that people don't
eat, live, and handle stress

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:38.600 align:middle line:84%
properly is they don't
want to because now there's

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.670 align:middle line:90%
a quick fix with antibiotics.

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:43.430 align:middle line:84%
But the good news is,
the antibiotics are soon

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:44.330 align:middle line:90%
going to be useless.

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:45.913 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing
more harm than good.

00:29:45.913 --> 00:29:48.630 align:middle line:84%
People will have to start
getting back to living,

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:51.050 align:middle line:84%
eating, and handling
stress as I learned

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:52.990 align:middle line:84%
how to do to get
well from my cancer.

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:53.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:54.682 align:middle line:90%
Naturally.

00:29:54.682 --> 00:29:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Naturally, without drugs.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:57.140 align:middle line:90%
No chemo.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:58.400 align:middle line:90%
No radiation.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.400 align:middle line:90%
No mutilating surgeries.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>> The Earth produces
everything we need.

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:03.110 align:middle line:90%
The soul and so forth--

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.480 align:middle line:84%
all these forces are
there to help us.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>> The plan to get well from
every disease is totally free,

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:09.415 align:middle line:90%
except for food.

00:30:09.415 --> 00:30:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
buy that, anyway.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.500 align:middle line:90%
Or you can grow your own.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:16.250 align:middle line:84%
So there are all these ways
that people are being killed.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And all these vaccines
are doing terrible things

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:23.990 align:middle line:90%
to these young bodies.

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that is obvious
that most people laugh about--

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:38.690 align:middle line:84%
there have been men who
have been infertile,

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:40.940 align:middle line:84%
that all they have
to do is change

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:45.136 align:middle line:84%
the type of underwear they
wear, and they become fertile.

00:30:45.136 --> 00:30:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, let's talk about that.

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I think underwear is
a very important subject.

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if men
wear jockey shorts,

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:56.210 align:middle line:84%
it pulls the testicles
up close to the body.

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:58.270 align:middle line:84%
The reason the
testicles-- the testicles

00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:01.120 align:middle line:90%
are formed inside the abdomen.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.378 align:middle line:84%
And then they come-- they
descend as the baby is

00:31:03.378 --> 00:31:04.420 align:middle line:90%
being formed in the womb.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:07.300 align:middle line:84%
They descend, and they
go into the scrotal sack

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.820 align:middle line:84%
because they are meant
to be outside the body.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have an
undescended testicle

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.200 align:middle line:90%
in a child--

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.420 align:middle line:84%
and that occurs
sometimes-- you have

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.100 align:middle line:84%
to go in and operate
and bring it out

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:21.290 align:middle line:84%
because it has a
higher chance of cancer

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:22.660 align:middle line:90%
if you don't bring it back out.

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Because the testicles are meant
to be at a cooler temperature

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:28.970 align:middle line:90%
than body temperature.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:32.570 align:middle line:84%
If they're pulled up
close to the body,

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:37.630 align:middle line:84%
then the sperm
become non-motile,

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:39.590 align:middle line:90%
and they don't form as well.

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And so if they hang
free with boxer shorts--

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm serious when I say
that men who have not

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.680 align:middle line:84%
had a proper amount of sperm
or motility of their sperm,

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:54.820 align:middle line:84%
just by changing from jockey
shorts to boxer shorts,

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:58.480 align:middle line:84%
some have been able
to produce children.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.392 align:middle line:84%
And this is not a
malevolent thing

00:32:00.392 --> 00:32:01.600 align:middle line:90%
by the jockey short industry.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, no.

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:03.485 align:middle line:84%
>> They don't even
know about it.

00:32:03.485 --> 00:32:04.960 align:middle line:90%
But that is an easy thing to do.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Easy fix.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And then if people start
eating right and living right

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:12.080 align:middle line:84%
and drinking their water
and exercising properly,

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.722 align:middle line:84%
then these are the
things that can happen.

00:32:14.722 --> 00:32:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's go a little further
with that and talk about

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:18.970 align:middle line:90%
wearing synthetic fabrics--

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:22.960 align:middle line:84%
wearing bras with lots of
wire in them, for example.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, all of those
things can be a problem.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:30.670 align:middle line:84%
However, those are
tiny, tiny things

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:35.320 align:middle line:84%
compared to the way people
live, eat, and handle stress.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.880 align:middle line:90%
The way people think--

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.580 align:middle line:84%
going to movies and
watching all this violence

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:43.030 align:middle line:84%
causes a stress
reaction in their body.

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Even watching violence on
television or terrible stuff--

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:52.870 align:middle line:84%
the adrenal glands pour out
adrenaline and cortisone.

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:54.340 align:middle line:90%
That is the stress reaction.

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:56.110 align:middle line:84%
That's the fight
or flight reaction.

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:57.670 align:middle line:90%
We have in our body--

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:00.610 align:middle line:84%
God has given us this
ability to suddenly

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:04.120 align:middle line:84%
have tremendous energy, like
for a mother to lift a car off

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.770 align:middle line:84%
of her child or
to run from a bear

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:08.320 align:middle line:90%
or to run from an attacker.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's called the
flight or flight reaction.

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And every doctor
knows about this.

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a stress reaction.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.520 align:middle line:90%
But it's meant for short-term.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.530 align:middle line:84%
But people are so
stressed these days.

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:19.370 align:middle line:84%
They are operating
under chronic stress,

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:21.730 align:middle line:84%
whether it's domestic
stress or job stress.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very,
very detrimental thing.

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Also, it happens
when the government

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:29.110 align:middle line:90%
continues to scare you.

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:30.020 align:middle line:90%
It's an orange alert.

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:30.820 align:middle line:90%
It's a red alert.

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:31.620 align:middle line:90%
It's this.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:32.770 align:middle line:90%
And it makes people sick.

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think we
discussed last time,

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.300 align:middle line:84%
this is one of the reasons
that there was a major flu

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.310 align:middle line:90%
epidemic in 1918.

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Not only were people
injected with bad things--

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.683 align:middle line:90%


00:33:45.683 --> 00:33:47.350 align:middle line:84%
they were frightened
into thinking there

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:48.710 align:middle line:90%
was going to be a flu epidemic.

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:53.060 align:middle line:84%
So they took the vaccine,
which had the flu virus in it.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:55.060 align:middle line:84%
So the only people
that got the disease

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.430 align:middle line:84%
were the ones who
got the vaccinations.

00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:59.200 align:middle line:84%
But they were also
terribly stressed

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:04.990 align:middle line:84%
because of World War I. We
were in war against Germany.

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:06.730 align:middle line:84%
The Germans were
being demonized.

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:08.710 align:middle line:90%
Everybody hated the Germans.

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And when you hate, it causes
the stress reaction to occur.

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.850 align:middle line:84%
When you hold grudges,
whether it's against a friend

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:18.310 align:middle line:90%
or against a nation--

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:20.373 align:middle line:84%
and then they were sending
their boys off to war.

00:34:20.373 --> 00:34:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And they were being
killed in war.

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And then all the stress of the
families going through that.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:31.510 align:middle line:84%
So we were a nation waiting for
a bad disease to come along.

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And as they frightened
people more and more--

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:36.400 align:middle line:84%
and we have now this
financial crisis coming.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.199 align:middle line:84%
And people are going
to be terrified.

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:39.489 align:middle line:84%
They don't know how
they're going to live.

00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:41.810 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what's going
to happen to the economy.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:43.690 align:middle line:90%
So people become frightened.

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And then they become
prone to disease.

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And so that's another
way the government

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:51.190 align:middle line:90%
causes people to die.

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And then people
become despondent.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.420 align:middle line:90%
And they get on drugs.

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And then they kill themselves or
kill their children or whatever

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:01.270 align:middle line:84%
because many of
these antidepressants

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:03.400 align:middle line:84%
cause people to be
suicidal or homicidal.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Depressed.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.520 align:middle line:90%
Exactly Exactly.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is all
part of the plan.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.180 align:middle line:90%
All these SSRI antidepressants--

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:13.810 align:middle line:84%
You're saying those
side effects that we

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:16.460 align:middle line:84%
hear running by in a very
quick tone at the end

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:17.730 align:middle line:90%
of an advertisement--

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>> That if you have
any brain at all,

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:21.490 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't put this
stuff in your mouth.

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:27.455 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes Do you think that it's
a byproduct of-- or are these

00:35:27.455 --> 00:35:29.830 align:middle line:84%
things created knowing that
there are these side effects?

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:30.747 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, they know that.

00:35:30.747 --> 00:35:31.547 align:middle line:90%
They know it.

00:35:31.547 --> 00:35:32.347 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:32.347 --> 00:35:33.170 align:middle line:90%
They know it.

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:35.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the big
pharmaceutical guys--

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:37.990 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember if it
was Eli Lilly or Merck--

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:42.130 align:middle line:84%
said, our goal is to
get everybody on drugs.

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:43.480 align:middle line:90%
Everybody on drugs.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And so drugs are just
used for everything.

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Instead of people saying, oh,
well, now I've got a cold.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.820 align:middle line:90%
I need to get some rest.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.490 align:middle line:90%
And I need to drink water.

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And I need to eat
very light meals

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.810 align:middle line:90%
and let my body cleanse itself--

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:58.205 align:middle line:90%
no, no, no.

00:35:58.205 --> 00:35:59.330 align:middle line:90%
I've got to take something.

00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll go to Starbucks.

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:01.660 align:middle line:90%
I'll get a triple venti today.

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'll go to the doctor
and get some antibiotics,

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:06.110 align:middle line:84%
which don't work
for viruses, anyway.

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:07.940 align:middle line:90%
And give me some pills.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:09.800 align:middle line:90%
Just give me some pills.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.770 align:middle line:84%
People don't want to
change the way they live.

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me ask you
this, Lorraine.

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:17.900 align:middle line:84%
With what's coming
up with the economy,

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:21.420 align:middle line:84%
what's already in the
works-- well underway--

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.120 align:middle line:84%
I think you feel, as
a lot of people do,

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.910 align:middle line:84%
that this is an end
game to the way we

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:27.480 align:middle line:90%
have been living in the past.

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, from
everything I've read and seen,

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:31.490 align:middle line:90%
I would tend to agree.

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:33.900 align:middle line:84%
But I also look at it
as a mixed blessing.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.340 align:middle line:84%
There may be a
blessing in this--

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, of course.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>> --for us to regain something
that we didn't have while we

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:41.230 align:middle line:90%
were in the mill.

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
your perspective on it?

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, well, these
are all blessings.

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:47.120 align:middle line:90%
They're all blessings.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:51.140 align:middle line:84%
When antibiotics
become ineffective,

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:53.150 align:middle line:84%
it's a great blessing
because then people

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:56.000 align:middle line:84%
will have to start learning how
to eat, live, and handle stress

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.070 align:middle line:84%
properly and take
care of themselves.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:03.260 align:middle line:84%
When they start
decreasing medical care

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:06.200 align:middle line:84%
and rationing medical care, that
would be the greatest blessing

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.220 align:middle line:90%
of all.

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:11.540 align:middle line:84%
The health of America was
the best during World War II

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:15.680 align:middle line:84%
because number one,
sugar was rationed.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.555 align:middle line:84%
Meat, poultry, and
fish were rationed.

00:37:17.555 --> 00:37:22.940 align:middle line:90%


00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Everybody had what
was called a victory

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.150 align:middle line:90%
garden in their backyard.

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.950 align:middle line:90%
I remember those.

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:29.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm old enough.

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And so they were eating
vegetables out of their garden.

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest reason
that people were so well

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.865 align:middle line:84%
is, all the doctors
were overseas.

00:37:37.865 --> 00:37:40.625 align:middle line:90%


00:37:40.625 --> 00:37:42.230 align:middle line:90%
Seriously.

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And so people had
to start learning

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:45.118 align:middle line:90%
how to take care of themselves.

00:37:45.118 --> 00:37:46.910 align:middle line:84%
So when they start
rationing medical care--

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:49.118 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to ration
medical care because they

00:37:49.118 --> 00:37:51.170 align:middle line:90%
don't want people to live.

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And doctors in the emergency
room are going to be given

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:57.590 align:middle line:84%
the right-- and this has already
happened in some countries--

00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:00.020 align:middle line:84%
the doctors are going to be
given the right-- if you bring

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:04.970 align:middle line:84%
your father in who's
elderly, and maybe he

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:08.960 align:middle line:84%
has an arrhythmia, an
unstable heart rate.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And the ER doctor who
doesn't know your father

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:14.660 align:middle line:84%
at all, doesn't know his
quality of life or anything,

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:19.980 align:middle line:84%
will be able to have the right
to assess your father in five

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:20.780 align:middle line:90%
minutes--

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:22.940 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know
anything about him--

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:28.430 align:middle line:84%
decide on his own whether this
person has a decent quality

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:30.090 align:middle line:90%
of life or not.

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And if he decides he doesn't,
then he can just say,

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:36.050 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing we can do,
when inserting a pacemaker

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:38.400 align:middle line:90%
would be easy to do.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And so people are going to be
making these life and death

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:43.940 align:middle line:84%
decisions, doctors
in emergency rooms,

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and they will be denying
care right and left.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.100 align:middle line:90%
And HMOs are denying care.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.530 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you some
horror stories about what

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:53.540 align:middle line:90%
these HMOs are doing.

00:38:53.540 --> 00:39:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And so the good side of
this is that when there's

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.430 align:middle line:84%
a decrease in
medical care, people

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:10.550 align:middle line:84%
will have to start looking for
ways to be well on their own

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:11.540 align:middle line:90%
naturally.

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
that's what I did.

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.890 align:middle line:84%
When I developed my
cancer, I realized

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:17.780 align:middle line:84%
I'd seen thousands
of patients die

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:20.030 align:middle line:84%
from chemotherapy and
radiation that we give them.

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Horrible-- chemotherapy and
radiation both cause cancer.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.030 align:middle line:90%
I said, I'm not doing that.

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So I had to look around for
a way to truly get well.

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And everybody is
eventually going

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.110 align:middle line:90%
to have to learn how to do that.

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:35.270 align:middle line:84%
We have to go back to the
simpler things of life.

00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:38.910 align:middle line:84%
When I was growing up, there was
no television when I was a kid.

00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:39.990 align:middle line:90%
And so guess what we did?

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.790 align:middle line:90%
People came over.

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:42.320 align:middle line:90%
We played ping pong.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.880 align:middle line:90%
And we played board games.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.800 align:middle line:90%
And we had popcorn.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.180 align:middle line:90%
And we had a wonderful time.

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.062 align:middle line:84%
I view it exactly
the same way you do.

00:39:50.062 --> 00:39:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And people will
go back to that.

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And my parents got married at
the height of the Depression.

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:57.470 align:middle line:90%
They were really poor.

00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:58.820 align:middle line:90%
My dad had a job.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:01.490 align:middle line:84%
But he lost his job
during the Depression.

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And they had to live in
Southern Illinois in a tent

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.480 align:middle line:84%
and bury their
food in the ground.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.610 align:middle line:90%
That's poor.

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:13.340 align:middle line:84%
So I was raised with that
Depression mentality.

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:15.900 align:middle line:90%
I know what they went through.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And when I was growing up,
we didn't have money, either.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.437 align:middle line:90%
But we made our own fun.

00:40:20.437 --> 00:40:21.770 align:middle line:90%
People don't make their own fun.

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:23.993 align:middle line:84%
Kids now, they don't
come home and play.

00:40:23.993 --> 00:40:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Even my sons, when they
came home from school,

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:27.320 align:middle line:90%
they played after school.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.580 align:middle line:90%
Nobody plays anymore.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:32.120 align:middle line:84%
They don't develop any
creativity or decision

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.170 align:middle line:90%
making abilities.

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:37.710 align:middle line:84%
They learn to be part of a team
where they're told what to do.

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:39.640 align:middle line:84%
They're taught to be
aggressive and win.

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually-- all
of these competitive sports

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:50.150 align:middle line:84%
are training them to be
military aggressors to kill.

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they want
women to be active in sports,

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:55.460 align:middle line:84%
so they will also
become killers.

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And all of these schools,
they think it's so wonderful.

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And the parents think
it's so wonderful

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:02.690 align:middle line:84%
to have their children in
all these competitive sports.

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:05.030 align:middle line:90%
It's destroying them.

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And children do not
play anymore, which

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:10.250 align:middle line:90%
is very bad for their health.

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they never
have that rest cycle.

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Their being starts
on the adrenal crisis

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.300 align:middle line:90%
end from a very early age.

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.132 align:middle line:90%
>> Very early age.

00:41:18.132 --> 00:41:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's putting all sort
of stress on children

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:22.290 align:middle line:84%
because the whole
idea is to win.

00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's why,
if they don't win,

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.730 align:middle line:84%
if they don't get into
the right college,

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:27.438 align:middle line:84%
it's putting tremendous
pressure on them.

00:41:27.438 --> 00:41:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's one reason
that even children are

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:31.670 align:middle line:90%
on all these antidepressants.

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:33.360 align:middle line:90%
They're on drugs.

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:35.610 align:middle line:84%
They're eating because
they're nervous.

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:36.740 align:middle line:90%
They're becoming diabetic.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.210 align:middle line:90%
They're becoming obese.

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:40.360 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
are happening.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:48.012 align:middle line:84%
And again, my solution is the
only answer is to learn to--

00:41:48.012 --> 00:41:49.970 align:middle line:84%
first of all, you've got
to eat right and learn

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:51.230 align:middle line:90%
how to handle stress.

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:52.820 align:middle line:84%
The only real way
to handle stress

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:54.680 align:middle line:84%
is to learn how to
give it to the Lord

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.470 align:middle line:84%
because there's too
many stresses out there

00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:00.890 align:middle line:84%
for us to-- we can't just
withdraw from the world.

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:03.320 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn how
to rest in the Lord

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.340 align:middle line:90%
and give it to the Lord.

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And as things get worse,
as the economy just

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:09.920 align:middle line:84%
is destroyed, as they
devalue our money,

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.810 align:middle line:84%
people are going
to be destitute.

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And their hearts are truly going
to be failing them for fear.

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.086 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's going to
be on some kind of drug.

00:42:18.086 --> 00:42:20.210 align:middle line:90%
Drugs never cure disease.

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:21.840 align:middle line:90%
Drugs only treat symptoms.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:24.530 align:middle line:84%
These cover up the
symptoms while the problem

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:26.270 align:middle line:90%
continues to get worse.

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:28.970 align:middle line:90%
But there is a way to be well.

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're talking--
like you say,

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:31.935 align:middle line:84%
all of it's free
except the food.

00:42:31.935 --> 00:42:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And the way you
recommend, which is also

00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:37.000 align:middle line:84%
the quality of your thought
and intention, it's sunshine.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:37.800 align:middle line:90%
It's fresh air.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.905 align:middle line:84%
It's everything that we
no longer is utilize.

00:42:40.905 --> 00:42:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:44.600 align:middle line:84%
So the good news is,
you see, we never

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:47.120 align:middle line:90%
change if things are going well.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:50.800 align:middle line:84%
But when we got big
trouble, we change.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And some people will
actually turn to the Lord.

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:55.610 align:middle line:90%
There will be no way out.

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:57.780 align:middle line:84%
People will say, how
do we fight this?

00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:00.240 align:middle line:84%
There's no way to
fight this on our own.

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.820 align:middle line:90%
It's too big.

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:05.260 align:middle line:84%
What's coming down and the
manipulation of the currency,

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:07.970 align:middle line:84%
this has all been planned,
way back from the junk

00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:10.400 align:middle line:90%
bonds with Michael Milken.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.490 align:middle line:84%
That was all done,
with the junk bonds,

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:17.180 align:middle line:84%
to generate funds
to give mortgages

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:19.790 align:middle line:84%
to people who couldn't
really afford them,

00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:22.250 align:middle line:84%
to get everybody in
debt up to their ears,

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:24.500 align:middle line:84%
and then pull the rug
out from under them,

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:27.700 align:middle line:84%
as they've done with this
planned financial crisis.

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.420 align:middle line:84%
This is the same
sort of thing that

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:33.380 align:middle line:84%
happened in 1929, except
it's going to be worse now.

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And people are much
more violent now.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And they used to
be in bread lines.

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:41.120 align:middle line:90%
And they used to be orderly.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And now they're going
to be killing people

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:48.140 align:middle line:84%
in a bread line waiting to get
food because people have become

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:51.415 align:middle line:84%
so violent and aggressive,
partly because they've learned

00:43:51.415 --> 00:43:53.540 align:middle line:84%
that on television, partly
because they're drinking

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.520 align:middle line:84%
huge amounts of caffeine, which
makes you very aggressive.

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Partly because they've been
playing a lot of video games

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:00.770 align:middle line:84%
that have desensitized
the brain.

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:02.350 align:middle line:90%
Sports, aggressive sports--

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Video games are terrible.

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And the stuff that they're
putting in those video games--

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I talked to a little boy
the other day who's actually

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:12.000 align:middle line:90%
a distant family member.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Nine years old, and he
was playing a video game.

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:middle line:90%
He's a Christian.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.300 align:middle line:84%
A little boy playing
a video game.

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was watching him
play and I said, well,

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:20.422 align:middle line:90%
what are you doing there?

00:44:20.422 --> 00:44:22.710 align:middle line:84%
He says, I'm
killing the bad guy.

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:24.170 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, really?

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:26.090 align:middle line:90%
What did he do?

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:27.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, how
do you know he's bad?

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:32.420 align:middle line:90%
Well, the game says he's bad.

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, look at the
programming of that.

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Here is a child that's being
told that this person is bad.

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:43.222 align:middle line:84%
And the child is willing to
kill this person because someone

00:44:43.222 --> 00:44:44.180 align:middle line:90%
else told him it's bad.

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:46.200 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't even
know what he did.

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.590 align:middle line:84%
That's what's happening
to the whole population.

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:49.610 align:middle line:90%
I was appalled.

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:52.790 align:middle line:90%
And this child was a Christian.

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Theoretically, do not kill.

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:56.240 align:middle line:90%
Thou shalt not kill.

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>> But it's OK.

00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:58.280 align:middle line:90%
And the parents--

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:00.620 align:middle line:84%
Christians-- giving
this child this game.

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:02.400 align:middle line:84%
I thought, what
is going on here?

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:45:03.643 --> 00:45:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to some of
what you were talking about

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:06.977 align:middle line:90%
a moment ago in the economy.

00:45:06.977 --> 00:45:09.710 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to get to this
because I had heard this.

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to state
it as rumor, simply

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.240 align:middle line:84%
because it hasn't
been sourced yet,

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:19.760 align:middle line:84%
that the US has on one level
gone ahead with this plan

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.790 align:middle line:84%
to create the US,
Canada, and Mexico--

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:24.290 align:middle line:90%
the currency known as amero.

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And what I had heard
was that the US

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:30.720 align:middle line:84%
had paid the Chinese
government $800 billion ameros.

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the ameros haven't
been introduced yet.

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And you said you had
heard the same thing.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:38.212 align:middle line:90%
>> I have heard the same thing.

00:45:38.212 --> 00:45:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, we know that the
US, Canada, and Mexico will

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:43.820 align:middle line:90%
be combined by the year 2010.

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:44.690 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:49.640 align:middle line:84%
You can go on the web
at CFR.org, Council

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:53.170 align:middle line:84%
on Foreign Relations, which is
the elitist group in America.

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:55.490 align:middle line:84%
It's the Illuminati
in America, a group

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:58.925 align:middle line:90%
of 3,000 people that are--

00:45:58.925 --> 00:45:59.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Power players.

00:45:59.725 --> 00:46:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>> --presidents of universities
and head of the industrialists

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:03.920 align:middle line:90%
and all those.

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.140 align:middle line:90%
And so they get together.

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And on that website,
CFR.org, you

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:14.480 align:middle line:84%
can see they have published
a book putting together

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.040 align:middle line:90%
a North American community.

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:19.130 align:middle line:90%
They're proud of it.

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:21.680 align:middle line:84%
They're not secretive
about it anymore.

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And I run into
people all the time

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:24.990 align:middle line:84%
that say, oh, they'd
never do that.

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Of course they're
going to do it.

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:31.020 align:middle line:84%
It was signed into
being in 1990.

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:33.860 align:middle line:84%
They've been working on it
for much longer than that.

00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:35.930 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to be
like a European Union.

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:38.450 align:middle line:84%
They're going to tell you
it's being put together

00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:40.440 align:middle line:90%
for security and trade reasons.

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.240 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:43.415 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be a total union.

00:46:43.415 --> 00:46:45.980 align:middle line:90%


00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:49.070 align:middle line:84%
We've lost our constitution
already and our Bill of Rights.

00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get all the
bad stuff from Mexico and all

00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:54.380 align:middle line:84%
the bad stuff from Canada,
including human rights

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:57.440 align:middle line:84%
tribunals, where you
can be brought up

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.000 align:middle line:84%
in front of a court
where you are not

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.090 align:middle line:90%
allowed to know your accuser.

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:05.330 align:middle line:84%
You are not allowed to know
what the accusations are.

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:08.810 align:middle line:84%
You are not allowed to
cross-examine your accuser,

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:11.030 align:middle line:90%
and where truth is no defense.

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Those are happening
now in Canada.

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Truth is no defense, even though
you have to swear on the Bible

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.020 align:middle line:90%
to tell the truth.

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:21.655 align:middle line:84%
If you say something
that they don't like,

00:47:21.655 --> 00:47:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and there are
certain groups that

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:24.773 align:middle line:84%
don't like things
that are being said,

00:47:24.773 --> 00:47:26.690 align:middle line:84%
they say it doesn't
matter whether it's truth.

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:29.003 align:middle line:84%
It only matters if
we don't like it.

00:47:29.003 --> 00:47:30.170 align:middle line:90%
And there have been people--

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:32.450 align:middle line:84%
I have friends who
are in prison now

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:37.310 align:middle line:84%
because they have mentioned
certain taboos that

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:38.780 align:middle line:90%
are not allowed to be said.

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:40.520 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get
that here in America.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.080 align:middle line:84%
That's already
the law in Canada.

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get
all the drugs from Mexico.

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get all
of the problems from Mexico.

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:51.192 align:middle line:90%
And our country's gone.

00:47:51.192 --> 00:47:53.150 align:middle line:84%
So they're developing
the North American Union.

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:54.692 align:middle line:84%
They already have
the European Union.

00:47:54.692 --> 00:47:58.258 align:middle line:84%
The Asian Union is being
put together as we speak.

00:47:58.258 --> 00:48:00.050 align:middle line:84%
I have Chinese friends
who have said, yeah,

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:01.592 align:middle line:84%
it's being put
together the same way.

00:48:01.592 --> 00:48:05.030 align:middle line:84%
It will probably go into
effect in the year 2010.

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And on my website, I have
a map of the 10 kingdoms

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:16.100 align:middle line:84%
up there, which was
put together in 1974.

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:17.570 align:middle line:90%
And they called them kingdoms.

00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is the way
they're being put together.

00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:22.148 align:middle line:84%
So this is happening for
a one world government.

00:48:22.148 --> 00:48:23.690 align:middle line:84%
There will be a one
world government.

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:26.550 align:middle line:84%
There will be a
one world religion.

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:28.880 align:middle line:84%
They have to implode
the United States.

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>> One world army?

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:30.810 align:middle line:90%
One world military?

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>> That's already almost
NATO and One World Health

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:35.330 align:middle line:90%
Organization, World Health--

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:38.720 align:middle line:84%
it's all going to be run through
the United Nations, which is

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.393 align:middle line:90%
all run by these same elitists.

00:48:41.393 --> 00:48:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have a
constitution of the United

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Nations, which eliminates
all of our rights.

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to have a UN tax.

00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:52.400 align:middle line:84%
It's all going to
be run by the UN.

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:56.200 align:middle line:84%
But the people who run
the UN are an evil cabal.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.060 align:middle line:90%
They are a very evil cabal.

00:48:58.060 --> 00:48:59.800 align:middle line:90%
And they hate us.

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.260 align:middle line:84%
As I said earlier, they
call us useless eaters

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:05.220 align:middle line:90%
and the disgusting public.

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And so people like to think that
their government likes them.

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:14.760 align:middle line:84%
I just want to say, your
government hates you.

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:17.310 align:middle line:90%
Your government hates you.

00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:22.200 align:middle line:84%
People like Prince Philip in
England and Prince Charles--

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Prince Philip-- I
think he's the one who

00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:26.498 align:middle line:84%
said he wants to
come back as a virus.

00:49:26.498 --> 00:49:28.290 align:middle line:84%
If he's reincarnated,
he wants to come back

00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:30.330 align:middle line:84%
as a virus to kill as
many people as possible

00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:31.920 align:middle line:90%
on the Earth.

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:35.040 align:middle line:84%
These people are all part
of this environmentalism.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.320 align:middle line:84%
They're all part
of this green plan

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:40.020 align:middle line:84%
that I talked about in
Report from Iron Mountain.

00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's to depopulate
the Earth because they

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:45.610 align:middle line:90%
want the whole Earth for them.

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
see whole cities being

00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:53.250 align:middle line:90%
actually confiscated.

00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:55.410 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
try to get people--

00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:57.480 align:middle line:84%
first of all, the
high gas prices

00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.610 align:middle line:84%
will cause people to
move back into the cities

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:01.660 align:middle line:84%
because they can't afford
to commute as much.

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:03.600 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the reasons
they're doing that.

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.810 align:middle line:90%
They want to do that.

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:07.950 align:middle line:84%
They want to get people
back into the city, where

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:11.250 align:middle line:84%
they can get them almost
in rabbit warrens.

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:15.000 align:middle line:84%
I was in Siberia before
the wall came down.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.610 align:middle line:90%
And on the way to Siberia--

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:19.260 align:middle line:84%
I was with another
group of doctors

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:20.460 align:middle line:84%
who were going over
there to operate

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:21.877 align:middle line:84%
with some of these
Russian doctors

00:50:21.877 --> 00:50:23.520 align:middle line:90%
and show them our techniques.

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And so when we got
to Moscow, there

00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:35.000 align:middle line:84%
was a KGB agent on every
floor in the hotel.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And when we went up the
elevator to go to our room,

00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:42.290 align:middle line:84%
we had to stop and check in
with the KGB agent on our floor.

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Nobody could come to our room
without the KGB officer knowing

00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:46.880 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:49.430 align:middle line:84%
You see, it's much harder
to keep track of people

00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:52.043 align:middle line:84%
when they're all out here
in developments and out

00:50:52.043 --> 00:50:53.210 align:middle line:90%
in the country and all that.

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:55.370 align:middle line:84%
They want to force
people into the cities

00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:58.477 align:middle line:84%
to live in little cubicles so
they can keep track of them.

00:50:58.477 --> 00:50:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Much more controllable.

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:00.770 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And you've been following all
of this for a very long time.

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:04.040 align:middle line:90%
>> A long time.

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:04.840 align:middle line:90%
20 years.

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>> 20 years, all of these.

00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And you've compiled a lot of it
in a book called The Coming New

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:13.677 align:middle line:84%
World Order, How it Will
Dramatically Change Your Life.

00:51:13.677 --> 00:51:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is available on your
website now, too isn't it?

00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>> It's on my website.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.350 align:middle line:90%
I have two websites.

00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:20.630 align:middle line:84%
I have a website
on health, showing

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:22.160 align:middle line:84%
how I got well
from severe cancer

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:26.090 align:middle line:84%
without drugs, without
chemo, radiation, or surgery.

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>> And what's that URL, again?

00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>> That's www.drday.com.

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:33.000 align:middle line:90%
>> drday.com

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>> drday.com.

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:35.760 align:middle line:90%
All small letters.

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:36.860 align:middle line:90%
drday.com.

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:41.180 align:middle line:84%
The other one is called
goodnewsaboutgod.com

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:44.180 align:middle line:90%
All small letters, all one word.

00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:45.230 align:middle line:90%
goodnewsaboutgod.com.

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:47.120 align:middle line:84%
It has a lot of
religious information.

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.970 align:middle line:84%
But it has a lot of
political information.

00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:50.720 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of health
information there.

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Enormous amount of
political information--

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:58.310 align:middle line:84%
I probably have 800
articles up on that website.

00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lot of
articles about health.

00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:01.940 align:middle line:84%
I've got information
on Gardasil.

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:04.080 align:middle line:84%
I've got information
on population control.

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Good information on bird flu,
which we haven't discussed yet,

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:08.850 align:middle line:90%
which we may want to.

00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I would like to.

00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:11.330 align:middle line:84%
That was the first thing
I wanted to discuss.

00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And here, it's toward
the end of the interview.

00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:14.570 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about that
right now because they're

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:15.590 align:middle line:90%
trotting it out.

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:18.320 align:middle line:84%
I just pulled up
a government site

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:22.190 align:middle line:84%
on the pandemic of the avian
flu, which that's obviously

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:23.300 align:middle line:90%
going to be trotted out.

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And I have an article on my
website, goodnewsaboutgod.com,

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:32.810 align:middle line:84%
which is entitled "How One
Wicked Nation Can Kill Billions

00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:35.210 align:middle line:90%
Around the World with One Lie."

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And the point is,
they want people

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:42.530 align:middle line:84%
to be afraid of a
disease so they can

00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:45.260 align:middle line:90%
be forced to get vaccinations.

00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And in the vaccinations will
be put terrible bacteria

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:52.370 align:middle line:84%
and viruses that
will not help you

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:55.730 align:middle line:84%
at all in the disease
that's supposedly coming

00:52:55.730 --> 00:53:00.560 align:middle line:84%
but will give you other horrible
diseases that will kill you.

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
they're going to start

00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:04.410 align:middle line:90%
decreasing the population.

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So we remember a
few years ago, there

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:11.930 align:middle line:84%
was the disease,
supposedly SARS, that was

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:13.280 align:middle line:90%
going to do terrible things.

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, SARS didn't materialize.

00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And so they had to
have a SARS with wings.

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they
came up with bird flu.

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And so they've been trying to
get bird flu going and getting

00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:25.070 align:middle line:90%
people afraid of it.

00:53:25.070 --> 00:53:26.970 align:middle line:84%
But they haven't
been very successful.

00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:31.760 align:middle line:84%
So they have more and more
of these websites coming up

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.620 align:middle line:84%
saying how terrible
this is going to be.

00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:36.590 align:middle line:90%


00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:38.988 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to use
reverse psychology on people.

00:53:38.988 --> 00:53:41.530 align:middle line:84%
They're going to say, just like
they do with the flu vaccine,

00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:44.180 align:middle line:84%
they're going to say, oh, we
only have limited quantities.

00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:48.030 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to line
up soon to get your vaccine.

00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, they've got
unlimited quantities.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.680 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, they
want you to want it.

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And then you are actually-- even
though many times, it's free.

00:53:58.310 --> 00:54:01.760 align:middle line:90%
But people pay to be killed.

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.940 align:middle line:84%
People pay to be killed with
chemotherapy and radiation.

00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:07.630 align:middle line:84%
They pay for the
doctors to kill them.

00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:11.600 align:middle line:84%
They are going to pay for
vaccines that will kill them

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:13.470 align:middle line:90%
and vaccines for their children.

00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:16.190 align:middle line:84%
These vaccines don't
accomplish anything.

00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:19.670 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest, anybody who
wants to read about vaccines,

00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:24.950 align:middle line:84%
go to a website
called Thinktwice.

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:26.700 align:middle line:90%
One word, thinktwice dot--

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:27.500 align:middle line:90%
I think it's org.

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.600 align:middle line:90%
Either org or dot com.

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:33.130 align:middle line:84%
There are some wonderful books
there on vaccines by Neil

00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:35.540 align:middle line:90%
Miller, N-E-I-L Miller.

00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:39.050 align:middle line:84%
One of them is called "Vaccines:
Are They Safe and Effective?"

00:54:39.050 --> 00:54:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And it will show you that
no vaccine has ever worked.

00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:43.100 align:middle line:90%
They're not effective.

00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:44.750 align:middle line:90%
They don't work.

00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:46.250 align:middle line:90%
They're all dangerous.

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And so what they
want to do is, they

00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:51.410 align:middle line:84%
want to scare you into
thinking that this bird

00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:52.880 align:middle line:90%
flu is coming around.

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And they're even trying
to make it more toxic by--

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:59.990 align:middle line:84%
and see, it's been
in birds, supposedly.

00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And they say it can be
transmitted to human beings.

00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, now
they get everybody afraid

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.160 align:middle line:84%
because birds are
all over the place.

00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:08.660 align:middle line:90%
And oh, my, the birds--

00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:10.450 align:middle line:84%
we've got to be ready
for the birds now.

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:12.370 align:middle line:84%
They've made people
afraid of the sun.

00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Sunlight doesn't
cause skin cancer.

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:15.720 align:middle line:90%
It never has.

00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:16.520 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't now.

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:18.980 align:middle line:84%
But doctors have all
been trained to say that.

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:23.480 align:middle line:84%
I talk about all the evidence in
the medical literature showing

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:24.980 align:middle line:84%
sunlight does not
cause skin cancer.

00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:27.147 align:middle line:84%
It's the way people are
eating, living, and handling

00:55:27.147 --> 00:55:28.160 align:middle line:90%
stress that's doing it.

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And so when birds are
all over the place,

00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:32.720 align:middle line:84%
people are going
to be terrified.

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And they won't want birds
around because they think

00:55:35.350 --> 00:55:37.090 align:middle line:90%
they're going to get bird flu.

00:55:37.090 --> 00:55:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, what they've
done is they have

00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:41.710 align:middle line:84%
genetically engineer--
they can genetically

00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:42.940 align:middle line:90%
engineer this virus.

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And then they can
grow it in human cells

00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:47.860 align:middle line:84%
in the laboratory to make
humans more susceptible to it.

00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And they keep talking about
all of these people who

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:56.170 align:middle line:84%
are getting bird flu in Malaysia
or someplace like this--

00:55:56.170 --> 00:55:57.610 align:middle line:90%
Indonesia.

00:55:57.610 --> 00:56:00.893 align:middle line:84%
And yet, first of all, you never
get any documentation for that.

00:56:00.893 --> 00:56:02.560 align:middle line:84%
There are almost
always suspected cases.

00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:03.970 align:middle line:90%
You never get them confirmed.

00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, they're always in some
little burg out in the village.

00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can tell you, the
World Health Organization

00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:12.610 align:middle line:90%
isn't out there.

00:56:12.610 --> 00:56:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And how do they
know they've got it?

00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:19.240 align:middle line:84%
But they're wanting
to scare everybody.

00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:22.950 align:middle line:84%
They're also wanting to turn
one race against another.

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:25.080 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we don't want any
Indonesians around.

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And besides, Indonesians,
see, are Muslims.

00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:28.570 align:middle line:84%
We don't want any
of them around.

00:56:28.570 --> 00:56:32.430 align:middle line:84%
Muslims are Indonesians,
and they carry the bird flu.

00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:33.230 align:middle line:90%
So there.

00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:34.120 align:middle line:90%
You know they're bad.

00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Creating this
divisiveness and fear.

00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So the recommendation
is, don't buy it.

00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:41.460 align:middle line:90%
Do not get the vaccine.

00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Do not get any
vaccines for anything.

00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:45.810 align:middle line:90%
They do not work.

00:56:45.810 --> 00:56:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's the Illuminati's way
of depopulating the Earth.

00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Just one of the
ways, but a big one.

00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:59.050 align:middle line:84%
A very big one, where actually,
people go willingly as a lamb

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:01.690 align:middle line:84%
to the slaughter
and line up to get

00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:05.110 align:middle line:84%
injected with lethal
bacteria and viruses

00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:09.010 align:middle line:84%
that will make them
die a horrible death.

00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:12.700 align:middle line:84%
As I've said before, there
was virtually no autism

00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:14.420 align:middle line:90%
before they started vaccines.

00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:17.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the mercury in there
that causes brain damage.

00:57:17.350 --> 00:57:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Learning disabilities are
caused by the vaccines.

00:57:20.350 --> 00:57:23.290 align:middle line:84%
But doctors are being taught
that if the person doesn't

00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:25.930 align:middle line:84%
die in the office,
well, then it's

00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:27.800 align:middle line:90%
not related to the vaccine.

00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, a wonderful doctor named
Dr. Schreiber has shown clearly

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:37.210 align:middle line:84%
by hooking babies
up to electrodes

00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:41.290 align:middle line:84%
how their heart rate
and their breathing rate

00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:43.540 align:middle line:84%
and their blood pressure and
all was absolutely normal

00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:45.100 align:middle line:90%
until they get vaccinated.

00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:46.990 align:middle line:90%
And then it's all over the map.

00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And these babies that
were being tested

00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:51.598 align:middle line:84%
were put on monitors
so they could

00:57:51.598 --> 00:57:54.140 align:middle line:84%
tell when they stopped breathing
because they frequently did.

00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:57.160 align:middle line:84%
But that was only after
they were vaccinated.

00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:59.830 align:middle line:84%
So the babies were used
as their own control--

00:57:59.830 --> 00:58:01.870 align:middle line:84%
how they were before
the vaccination

00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:03.860 align:middle line:90%
and how they were afterwards.

00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is very, very
obvious proof of the damage

00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:09.910 align:middle line:90%
that vaccines do.

00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:13.030 align:middle line:90%

>> Lorraine has much more to
say about recovering our health

00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:16.540 align:middle line:90%

previous interviews with her.
