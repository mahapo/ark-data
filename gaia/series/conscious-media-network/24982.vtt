00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:03.621
<v ->With fuel prices spiraling out of control,</v>

2
00:00:03.621 --> 00:00:06.525
many people are becoming desperate to find alternatives.

3
00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:08.960
It's not that alternatives haven't been there all along,

4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.030
they've simply been cloaked in secrecy and suppressed.

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.366
All to promote the continued use of oil.

6
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:17.336
The one commodity that controls most of our lives.

7
00:00:17.336 --> 00:00:19.871
Thomas Valone is a physicist and engineer

8
00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:22.740
who also publishes Future Energy magazine.

9
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.578
His day job is as a patent examiner for the US government.

10
00:00:26.578 --> 00:00:28.914
This puts him in direct contact with many

11
00:00:28.914 --> 00:00:30.782
of these exotic technologies.

12
00:00:30.782 --> 00:00:32.583
Technologies that could have changed

13
00:00:32.583 --> 00:00:35.187
the future condition of our beauiful planet.

14
00:00:35.187 --> 00:00:37.990
One of the most profound new automobile breatkthroughs

15
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.790
was the water car.

16
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.714 line:15% 
(slow paced music)

17
00:00:46.664 --> 00:00:50.268
I wanted to start this in a place all of us get.

18
00:00:50.268 --> 00:00:51.736
We're beginning to grow.

19
00:00:51.736 --> 00:00:53.504
Specially with the Al Gore's release of the movie

20
00:00:53.504 --> 00:00:54.639
"An Inconvenient Truth,"

21
00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:56.676
but for many people way before that.

22
00:00:56.676 --> 00:01:00.312
And that is the truth behind the subject of global warming.

23
00:01:00.312 --> 00:01:02.580
From a scientific point of view,

24
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.017
and you've been in alternative energies,

25
00:01:05.017 --> 00:01:07.018
technologies for many, many years.

26
00:01:07.018 --> 00:01:09.988
So I'm sure you've made it a point

27
00:01:09.988 --> 00:01:12.090
to know this information inside out and backwards.

28
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.259
What's the truth behind global warming?

29
00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.595
What are we up against or not?

30
00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:18.864
<v ->Well to begin global warming,</v>

31
00:01:18.864 --> 00:01:20.699
which I always include in my presentations

32
00:01:20.699 --> 00:01:22.199
on future energy,

33
00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:26.672
one thing that is very simply provable,

34
00:01:26.672 --> 00:01:30.041
is that the Arctic ice cap has been

35
00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:32.243
steadily melting for years.

36
00:01:32.243 --> 00:01:33.311
And the funny thing is

37
00:01:33.311 --> 00:01:35.447
that it's happening within our lifetime.

38
00:01:35.447 --> 00:01:37.348
There was a Time magazine article

39
00:01:37.348 --> 00:01:39.685
from several years ago that actually

40
00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:42.621
showed a nice little graph of how in 1980

41
00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:45.423
the average thickness was about 16 feet

42
00:01:45.423 --> 00:01:47.759
and now the average thickness of the Arctic ice cap

43
00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.194
is around eight feet thick.

44
00:01:49.194 --> 00:01:50.061
<v Voiceover>Wow, that's a lot of</v>

45
00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:51.753
loss in a short time.
<v ->It was only 20 years.</v>

46
00:01:51.753 --> 00:01:53.264
<v Thomas>And so we're looking at</v>

47
00:01:53.264 --> 00:01:55.133
a maximum of 20 years more,

48
00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:57.902
and the entire antarctic ocean will actually

49
00:01:57.902 --> 00:02:00.105
be visible and open to shipping.

50
00:02:00.105 --> 00:02:01.506
<v Voiceover>What does this mean?</v>

51
00:02:01.506 --> 00:02:04.444
<v ->Well, the implication for the earth</v>

52
00:02:04.444 --> 00:02:07.980
and for our climate, besides the political advantage

53
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.083
for countries that want to exploit it

54
00:02:11.083 --> 00:02:15.053
is that we're now faced with an opposite sink.

55
00:02:15.053 --> 00:02:18.005
We still have this day,

56
00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.360
heat sink at the top and bottom of our world.

57
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.929
We're about to lose one of the heat sinks.

58
00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:27.632
And that means that where heat used to go

59
00:02:27.632 --> 00:02:30.786
to dissipate, it can't go anymore.

60
00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:33.739
And furthermore, what's worse about that

61
00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.175
is the Arctic ice cap was the size of North America

62
00:02:37.175 --> 00:02:39.043
reflecting most of the light.

63
00:02:39.043 --> 00:02:41.179
White reflects with light.

64
00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:42.980
The albedo is totally gonna change

65
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.549
with the ocean being visible

66
00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.752
for that same area it'll be absorptive.

67
00:02:47.752 --> 00:02:51.523
And this is a compounding exponential additive.

68
00:02:51.523 --> 00:02:53.891
Where you have normal global warming

69
00:02:53.891 --> 00:02:56.060
and then you have this extra feature.

70
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.596
And there's lots of extra features they're

71
00:02:57.596 --> 00:03:00.331
now discovering that make a runaway

72
00:03:00.331 --> 00:03:04.735
chain reaction type of catastrophic jump

73
00:03:04.735 --> 00:03:07.506
to a new thermal level

74
00:03:07.506 --> 00:03:09.942
that of course we won't anticipate until it happens

75
00:03:09.942 --> 00:03:12.011
and then wonder why we didn't do something about it.

76
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:14.112
<v Voiceover>And we're talking the relatively near future.</v>

77
00:03:14.112 --> 00:03:15.913
<v ->Within our lifetime, within 20 years.</v>

78
00:03:15.913 --> 00:03:17.549
<v Voiceover>Within 20 years and the effects</v>

79
00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.418
could be, I assume, rising sea levels.

80
00:03:20.418 --> 00:03:22.388
<v ->Absolutely, well not from the Arctic.</v>

81
00:03:22.388 --> 00:03:23.755
And I have to clarify this.

82
00:03:23.755 --> 00:03:25.691
Wherever ice floats in water,

83
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:27.459
you won't get an increase
<v Voiceover>That makes sense.</v>

84
00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.528
<v Thomas>in ice and sea level.</v>

85
00:03:29.528 --> 00:03:32.196
However, there's a graph that I show

86
00:03:32.196 --> 00:03:34.699
that I give credit to Jim Hansen

87
00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:37.837
for publishing it in many places,

88
00:03:37.837 --> 00:03:40.106
including MIT's technology review.

89
00:03:40.106 --> 00:03:42.708
And this is a 400,000 year graph

90
00:03:42.708 --> 00:03:45.987
of the Greenland ice cap.

91
00:03:45.987 --> 00:03:50.933
And so they got a nice half million year record

92
00:03:50.933 --> 00:03:53.285
of the sea level temperature

93
00:03:53.285 --> 00:03:55.887
and the carbon dioxide level.

94
00:03:55.887 --> 00:03:57.422
For all those years.

95
00:03:57.422 --> 00:03:59.690
And the amazing thing when you look at the entire graph

96
00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.293
and I chopped it and made it a page length

97
00:04:02.293 --> 00:04:06.865
to make it a little more beginning and end type of episode.

98
00:04:06.865 --> 00:04:09.567
You see that the three track, they're lockstepped

99
00:04:09.567 --> 00:04:10.535
for all the years.

100
00:04:10.535 --> 00:04:13.104
They go through the ice ages very nicely together,

101
00:04:14.014 --> 00:04:15.507
where it's going up and down together

102
00:04:15.507 --> 00:04:19.377
for say 90, 80,000 years.

103
00:04:19.377 --> 00:04:21.880
And then we got, as we now have had

104
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.248
a 10,000 year interglacial period.

105
00:04:24.248 --> 00:04:26.085
But the strange thing is,

106
00:04:26.085 --> 00:04:28.387
never in those 400,000 years

107
00:04:28.387 --> 00:04:30.982
has the carbon dioxide level exceeded

108
00:04:30.982 --> 00:04:34.760
300 parts per million.

109
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.761
We're at 380 right now,

110
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:39.498
we're expected to exceed 400.

111
00:04:39.498 --> 00:04:41.899
The amount of carbon dioxide we have

112
00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:44.336
is way above the other two lines.

113
00:04:44.336 --> 00:04:46.438
And temperature is just starting to catch up

114
00:04:46.438 --> 00:04:48.640
because the carbon dioxide it jumped

115
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.775
so fast within just the past century.

116
00:04:50.775 --> 00:04:55.180
So what I explain to the audience is that

117
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.749
we are no already in debt

118
00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:03.688
for the temperature catch up and for the sea level catch up.

119
00:05:03.688 --> 00:05:05.389
<v Voiceover>With no way to pay off the debt.</v>

120
00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.726
<v ->The only way is to reduce the carbon dioxide level</v>

121
00:05:07.726 --> 00:05:09.502
from where it is now downward.

122
00:05:09.502 --> 00:05:12.230
And of course in the near horizon,

123
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.932
the next five or 10 years there's

124
00:05:13.932 --> 00:05:16.502
nothing of global significance.

125
00:05:16.502 --> 00:05:18.603
Except for maybe Russ George's approach

126
00:05:18.603 --> 00:05:21.073
to get millions of tons out of the air.

127
00:05:21.073 --> 00:05:23.775
But about 8,000,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide

128
00:05:23.775 --> 00:05:25.810
are needed to be sequestered.

129
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.811
And plankton's beein doing it very nicely.

130
00:05:27.811 --> 00:05:31.149
You can cause plankton blooms as Russ George

131
00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:33.018
does with his company Planktos.

132
00:05:33.018 --> 00:05:33.885
<v Voiceover>Well let's talk about</v>

133
00:05:33.885 --> 00:05:35.186
that for a minute
<v ->But it's still a long shot.</v>

134
00:05:35.186 --> 00:05:36.387
<v Voiceover>because Richard Branston,</v>

135
00:05:36.387 --> 00:05:37.755
owner of Virgin Airlines has put out

136
00:05:37.755 --> 00:05:39.725
this $25,000,000 reward for anyone

137
00:05:39.725 --> 00:05:42.362
who can find a genuine solution to the problem.

138
00:05:42.362 --> 00:05:44.530
And now in response to that,

139
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.432
Russ Gordon has come up with an interesting concept.

140
00:05:47.432 --> 00:05:48.266
<v ->Russ George.</v>

141
00:05:48.266 --> 00:05:49.734
<v Voiceover>Russ George, excuse me.</v>

142
00:05:49.734 --> 00:05:52.436
Could you please go ahead and tell us what that is?

143
00:05:52.436 --> 00:05:55.106
<v ->Well, planktos.com is the company.</v>

144
00:05:55.106 --> 00:05:56.340
It's publicly trading.

145
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.009
I encourage people to actually

146
00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.145
give their support to the company.

147
00:06:00.145 --> 00:06:02.580
The strange thing is, and this is really literally

148
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.483
out of the book, "Structure of Scientific Revolutions,"

149
00:06:05.483 --> 00:06:06.317
by Thomas Kuhn.

150
00:06:06.317 --> 00:06:09.754
I use that as a guide book because what Thomas Kuhn

151
00:06:09.754 --> 00:06:12.190
predicts is that any time you do something

152
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.826
that's revolutionary, something new,

153
00:06:13.826 --> 00:06:17.396
something scientifically unprovable at the moment,

154
00:06:17.396 --> 00:06:21.400
immediately the first stage is opposition.

155
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.468
And it's irrational opposition.

156
00:06:23.468 --> 00:06:25.502
And darn it, would you believe Russ George

157
00:06:25.502 --> 00:06:29.373
got attacked like crazy in all the major media.

158
00:06:29.373 --> 00:06:30.975
Scientific American, Time magazine--

159
00:06:30.975 --> 00:06:32.410
<v Voiceover>So this solution he's proposing.</v>

160
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.413
<v ->Yeah, and the strange thing is he watches science programs</v>

161
00:06:35.413 --> 00:06:38.282
and they say yes planktons sequestors carbon dioxide,

162
00:06:38.282 --> 00:06:40.652
and you know, it's been doing it for millions of years

163
00:06:40.652 --> 00:06:43.153
and it falls down to the bottom of the ocean.

164
00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:44.422
You can actually see it.

165
00:06:44.422 --> 00:06:47.826
That the carbon does in 50 to 70% of it

166
00:06:47.826 --> 00:06:50.595
still goes below the thermal climb and so forth.

167
00:06:50.595 --> 00:06:52.263
This is so acceptable science

168
00:06:52.263 --> 00:06:55.566
that no one could question the actual science of it.

169
00:06:55.566 --> 00:06:56.467
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about what</v>

170
00:06:56.467 --> 00:06:57.569
he's actually suggesting.

171
00:06:57.569 --> 00:06:59.337
<v ->But he's artificially stimulating it</v>

172
00:06:59.337 --> 00:07:01.440
by adding extra iron powder.

173
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.341
Which is normally--

174
00:07:02.341 --> 00:07:03.441
<v Voiceover>So he wants to add extra iron powder</v>

175
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:06.277
to make a really healthy plankton flourish again?

176
00:07:06.277 --> 00:07:07.445
<v ->That's right, to bloom.</v>

177
00:07:07.445 --> 00:07:09.180
To bloom and you can see it from a satellite image.

178
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.016
You've all of a sudden got a green area

179
00:07:11.016 --> 00:07:12.350
that's now very vital.

180
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.686
But as soon as it absorbs the carbon dioxide,

181
00:07:14.686 --> 00:07:18.889
which plants do, it will actually start to die

182
00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:20.792
and bring it down to the bottom of the ocean.

183
00:07:20.792 --> 00:07:22.493
Which is exactly what we want.

184
00:07:22.493 --> 00:07:24.863
<v Voiceover>So what are the implications</v>

185
00:07:24.863 --> 00:07:28.600
of artificially adding iron to that environment?

186
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.968
Are there some negative?

187
00:07:30.968 --> 00:07:33.338
Are there any complications or is it--

188
00:07:33.338 --> 00:07:36.074
<v ->I wrote to the editor of IEEE Spectrum.</v>

189
00:07:36.074 --> 00:07:38.376
I'm a member of IEEE and I felt insulted

190
00:07:38.376 --> 00:07:42.079
when they did an issue on 10 do's or don'ts.

191
00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:44.682
Or winners or losers.

192
00:07:44.682 --> 00:07:47.051
The technology assessment of the past year.

193
00:07:47.051 --> 00:07:50.322
And of course Russ George was one page loser.

194
00:07:50.322 --> 00:07:51.622
That's literally what they called him.

195
00:07:51.622 --> 00:07:54.159
And the article read like an irrational

196
00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:56.495
grandmother's opinion from some--

197
00:07:56.495 --> 00:07:57.528
<v Voiceover>Well what are they saying?</v>

198
00:07:57.528 --> 00:08:00.332
What are they objecting to with this?

199
00:08:00.332 --> 00:08:02.200
I mean I know you don't wanna mess with any system,

200
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.934
but we've already messed with it so badly

201
00:08:03.934 --> 00:08:05.003
we're probably gonna have
<v Thomas>That's my point.</v>

202
00:08:05.003 --> 00:08:06.405
<v Voiceover>to mess with it to get it back</v>

203
00:08:06.405 --> 00:08:07.606
on some level.
<v Thomas>That's my point.</v>

204
00:08:07.606 --> 00:08:10.142
<v Thomas>I'd rather not dwell on the negative too much</v>

205
00:08:10.142 --> 00:08:12.010
because the strange thing is as you read

206
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.513
each of the articles there's no real substance

207
00:08:14.513 --> 00:08:15.913
to the negative side.

208
00:08:15.913 --> 00:08:18.349
However, the positive side has great benefits.

209
00:08:18.349 --> 00:08:20.117
<v Voiceover>It doesn't hurt marine life?</v>

210
00:08:20.117 --> 00:08:24.389
<v ->No, they can't find a substitive negative impact.</v>

211
00:08:24.389 --> 00:08:25.657
<v Voiceover>Well then why are they all over him?</v>

212
00:08:25.657 --> 00:08:28.025
<v ->Because the scientists haven't tested it yet.</v>

213
00:08:28.025 --> 00:08:29.128
(Thomas laughs)

214
00:08:29.128 --> 00:08:30.729
And literally that's the end of the article.

215
00:08:30.729 --> 00:08:32.797
This hasn't been approved by the scientist's.

216
00:08:32.797 --> 00:08:35.700
And would you believe Woods Hole in California

217
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.969
just a conference on this whole issue.

218
00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:39.470
A closed door conference with scientists

219
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.538
trying to figure it out.

220
00:08:40.538 --> 00:08:42.073
"Hey will this actually work?"

221
00:08:42.073 --> 00:08:43.475
They didn't invite Russ George,

222
00:08:43.475 --> 00:08:44.542
but they're trying to figure out

223
00:08:44.542 --> 00:08:46.711
could he possibly be right?

224
00:08:46.711 --> 00:08:48.679
<v Voiceover>What's Richard Branson have to say?</v>

225
00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:50.282
<v ->He's holding his money waiting.</v>

226
00:08:50.282 --> 00:08:51.966
I even talked to,

227
00:08:53.885 --> 00:08:58.156
Tippler, there's several agents for Branson

228
00:08:58.156 --> 00:08:59.691
that are at these conferences

229
00:08:59.691 --> 00:09:02.359
where you get to meet their right hand man.

230
00:09:02.359 --> 00:09:04.563
And they're also very cagey.

231
00:09:04.563 --> 00:09:06.047
They're still on the fence.

232
00:09:07.365 --> 00:09:09.200
They want agreement to the whole scientific

233
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.936
community apparently before they'll hand over the money.

234
00:09:11.936 --> 00:09:12.937
Which is unfortunate.

235
00:09:12.937 --> 00:09:13.938
<v Voiceover>Oh well then nothing.</v>

236
00:09:13.938 --> 00:09:15.240
I mean how is that ever going to work?

237
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.076
We already know the end of that story.

238
00:09:17.076 --> 00:09:19.544
<v ->Yeah, if we wait till everything's a proven theory</v>

239
00:09:19.544 --> 00:09:21.446
it's gonna be too late.

240
00:09:21.446 --> 00:09:24.683
But we can't go past 450 parts per million

241
00:09:24.683 --> 00:09:27.319
on the earth's carbon dioxide level

242
00:09:27.319 --> 00:09:29.587
or else it will be an irreversible change.

243
00:09:29.587 --> 00:09:30.922
<v Voiceover>And we're at 380.</v>

244
00:09:30.922 --> 00:09:33.357
<v ->Right, right, it'll take a Herculean effort.</v>

245
00:09:33.357 --> 00:09:35.159
In fact, that's why I'm giving a talk today

246
00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:37.529
on the archetypal significance of future energy.

247
00:09:37.529 --> 00:09:38.963
Because when you look at the Greek Gods

248
00:09:38.963 --> 00:09:41.298
you get these archetypal images of what

249
00:09:41.298 --> 00:09:44.035
happens when you add fire to your energy.

250
00:09:44.035 --> 00:09:45.669
Then you've got all kinds of problems,

251
00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:48.674
and impacts, and negative problems

252
00:09:48.674 --> 00:09:50.709
that have to be paid off.

253
00:09:50.709 --> 00:09:51.675
<v Voiceover>Can you give just a</v>

254
00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:52.743
little bit of that to us now?

255
00:09:52.743 --> 00:09:54.378
<v ->Prometheus is a great example.</v>

256
00:09:54.378 --> 00:09:56.681
And unfortunately when you're stealing fire

257
00:09:56.681 --> 00:09:58.416
and wanting to use it for mankind,

258
00:09:58.416 --> 00:10:01.118
which is exactly what we've done for the past 100 years,

259
00:10:01.118 --> 00:10:05.223
Tesla predicted, he said when you use fuel

260
00:10:05.223 --> 00:10:07.493
for mankind we're gonna have to stop it

261
00:10:07.493 --> 00:10:10.029
for the sake of future generations.

262
00:10:10.029 --> 00:10:12.598
Because of the negative consequences.

263
00:10:12.598 --> 00:10:13.865
There are all kinds.

264
00:10:13.865 --> 00:10:16.001
You're using a wast product that's a

265
00:10:16.001 --> 00:10:20.939
morbid death containing fossil.

266
00:10:20.939 --> 00:10:22.973
This is our ancestors if you wanna look at it that way.

267
00:10:22.973 --> 00:10:24.776
You're digging up the graves of the ancestors

268
00:10:24.776 --> 00:10:26.411
and we're adding fire to it.

269
00:10:26.411 --> 00:10:28.446
It's so disgusting.

270
00:10:28.446 --> 00:10:29.213
<v Voiceover>Primitive.</v>

271
00:10:29.213 --> 00:10:30.715
<v ->Primitive is the word for it.</v>

272
00:10:30.715 --> 00:10:33.952
That you end up realizing death begets death.

273
00:10:33.952 --> 00:10:36.887
And of course that's what we're doing to our atmosphere.

274
00:10:36.887 --> 00:10:40.391
We're adding pollution from burning of dead things

275
00:10:40.391 --> 00:10:42.993
to add more death to our living systems.

276
00:10:42.993 --> 00:10:44.930
And it's a contradictory thing.

277
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.565
We can't produce life from burning dead things.

278
00:10:47.565 --> 00:10:49.033
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about rising temperature</v>

279
00:10:49.033 --> 00:10:51.403
and the implications then for a moment.

280
00:10:51.403 --> 00:10:53.171
<v ->There have been plenty of programs on that.</v>

281
00:10:53.171 --> 00:10:56.742
The latest one was Six Degrees Could Change the World

282
00:10:56.742 --> 00:10:58.709
by National Geographic, it's on DVD.

283
00:10:58.709 --> 00:11:00.745
I advise everyone to go to that website.

284
00:11:00.745 --> 00:11:03.481
It's a one step beyond what the inconvenient truth

285
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:04.849
ever predicted.

286
00:11:04.849 --> 00:11:09.720
Al Gore was very cautionary in saying if this if that.

287
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.056
Well, this show tells you exactly what

288
00:11:12.056 --> 00:11:14.558
one degree C, two degree C, three degrees.

289
00:11:14.558 --> 00:11:16.293
And when you get beyond three degree C

290
00:11:16.293 --> 00:11:18.028
which is what the graph predicts

291
00:11:18.028 --> 00:11:21.400
we are already destined for, it's catastrophic.

292
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.502
Life starts end not only sea level,

293
00:11:24.502 --> 00:11:27.538
we're talking sea level of the 10's of meters.

294
00:11:27.538 --> 00:11:29.808
This particular graph I point to,

295
00:11:29.808 --> 00:11:31.942
when you try to match up temperature

296
00:11:31.942 --> 00:11:33.744
and sea level to where we are right now

297
00:11:33.744 --> 00:11:35.580
for carbon dioxide, we're talking about

298
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.116
80 meters of sea level rise.

299
00:11:38.116 --> 00:11:40.952
80 meters is, I thought, this can't be right.

300
00:11:40.952 --> 00:11:42.320
<v Voiceover>80 meters translate to feet</v>

301
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.055
for American audiences.

302
00:11:45.055 --> 00:11:46.958
So about 180, 200 feet right?

303
00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:47.925
<v ->At least.</v>

304
00:11:47.925 --> 00:11:52.453
And if we keep it approximate it's easier to grasp.

305
00:11:52.453 --> 00:11:55.399
Because to me even 10 or 20 meters

306
00:11:55.399 --> 00:11:57.602
seems to be very difficult to comprehend.

307
00:11:57.602 --> 00:11:59.403
People don't wanna swallow it.

308
00:11:59.403 --> 00:12:02.239
I've been Pacific islands and sea level areas

309
00:12:02.239 --> 00:12:03.874
where you realize, this is not gonna

310
00:12:03.874 --> 00:12:05.544
remain very much longer.

311
00:12:05.544 --> 00:12:07.290
'Cause even a 10 meter rise is gonna be

312
00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.114
catastrophic for all these big properties

313
00:12:09.114 --> 00:12:10.382
right on the ocean.

314
00:12:10.382 --> 00:12:11.282
<v Voiceover>That's right.</v>

315
00:12:11.282 --> 00:12:13.317
<v ->But the point I'm trying to emphasize,</v>

316
00:12:13.317 --> 00:12:15.519
this is actually feasible.

317
00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:18.555
And the reason is, when you combine Greenland

318
00:12:18.555 --> 00:12:20.124
and you combine Antarctica,

319
00:12:20.124 --> 00:12:22.626
both landlocked glaciers together

320
00:12:22.626 --> 00:12:25.012
you get 70 meters of sea level rise.

321
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:26.898
It's already ready.

322
00:12:26.898 --> 00:12:29.633
Greenland's moving fast, it's the fastest moving

323
00:12:29.633 --> 00:12:31.536
glacier system in the world.

324
00:12:31.536 --> 00:12:33.939
It's going towards the sea like there's no tomorrow.

325
00:12:33.939 --> 00:12:37.274
You can actually watch it move daily, 100 feet per day.

326
00:12:37.274 --> 00:12:38.476
<v Voiceover>Really, 100 feet a day.</v>

327
00:12:38.476 --> 00:12:39.977
<v ->Yeah, and the Antarctic, I just saw it,</v>

328
00:12:39.977 --> 00:12:42.914
it was like any day now this whole western cliff

329
00:12:42.914 --> 00:12:45.284
of Antarctica's about to break.

330
00:12:45.284 --> 00:12:48.386
There's a landlocked glacier bridge

331
00:12:48.386 --> 00:12:50.822
that is already melting, collapsing.

332
00:12:50.822 --> 00:12:51.856
And then this whole glacier

333
00:12:51.856 --> 00:12:53.791
waiting to just drop in the ocean.

334
00:12:53.791 --> 00:12:56.560
So Antarctica and the Greenland icecaps,

335
00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.098
ice covering are just melting like crazy.

336
00:13:03.508 --> 00:13:04.768
I'd like to look on the good side

337
00:13:04.768 --> 00:13:05.903
as part of what we can do.

338
00:13:05.903 --> 00:13:07.204
Because this is definitely
<v Voiceover>Yes, I wanted to</v>

339
00:13:07.204 --> 00:13:08.406
an emergency situation.
<v Voiceover>start looking</v>

340
00:13:08.406 --> 00:13:09.674
<v Voiceover>at the solutions.</v>

341
00:13:09.674 --> 00:13:11.475
Let me ask you this before we get to that.

342
00:13:11.475 --> 00:13:14.213
How much of this is man produced

343
00:13:14.213 --> 00:13:16.681
as a result of our bad habits we've developed,

344
00:13:16.681 --> 00:13:20.786
our gulping of oil, and the resultant effects,

345
00:13:20.786 --> 00:13:24.722
versus also some cosmic things that are happening as well.

346
00:13:24.722 --> 00:13:26.757
I mean a lot of solar activity and so forth.

347
00:13:26.757 --> 00:13:29.226
Is it both that are impacting it?

348
00:13:29.226 --> 00:13:31.763
We can't effect one but we can effect the other.

349
00:13:31.763 --> 00:13:33.464
What's the truth on that, do you know?

350
00:13:33.464 --> 00:13:35.132
<v ->Yes, and the media have always</v>

351
00:13:35.132 --> 00:13:37.635
tried to play that role of looking at

352
00:13:37.635 --> 00:13:39.804
the opposite natural occurrences.

353
00:13:39.804 --> 00:13:41.705
We're way beyond the natural occurrences.

354
00:13:41.705 --> 00:13:43.473
And in fact that graph I referred to,

355
00:13:43.473 --> 00:13:46.712
Jim Hansen's NASA graph points out

356
00:13:46.712 --> 00:13:49.113
that if we were within the natural ranges,

357
00:13:49.113 --> 00:13:51.382
we would have confined ourselves

358
00:13:51.382 --> 00:13:53.316
to the carbon dioxide levels that we've seen

359
00:13:53.316 --> 00:13:54.953
for the past 400,000 years.
<v Voiceover>That's very true.</v>

360
00:13:54.953 --> 00:13:56.553
<v Thomas>We go through so many ice ages</v>

361
00:13:56.553 --> 00:13:58.390
that everything that could have happened

362
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:01.260
did happen except for mans interference.

363
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.726
<v Voiceover>Okay, so we've put that to rest.</v>

364
00:14:02.726 --> 00:14:04.461
Now let's look at what man can do

365
00:14:04.461 --> 00:14:07.831
because you've been involved with alternative energies.

366
00:14:07.831 --> 00:14:10.468
You're a very creative mind and inventor.

367
00:14:10.468 --> 00:14:12.970
Not just an engineering physicist,

368
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:15.406
so you're a brainiac.

369
00:14:15.406 --> 00:14:18.676
Let's get into some of the technologies

370
00:14:18.676 --> 00:14:20.644
and I want a really down to earth view

371
00:14:20.644 --> 00:14:23.447
of which of the alternative technologies look like

372
00:14:23.447 --> 00:14:26.517
they really have legs

373
00:14:26.517 --> 00:14:29.286
in the very near future.

374
00:14:29.286 --> 00:14:30.754
I mean we know about hybrid technology.

375
00:14:30.754 --> 00:14:32.656
A lot of us are already on board with that.

376
00:14:32.656 --> 00:14:34.359
What's coming after hybrid technology

377
00:14:34.359 --> 00:14:37.061
that you can see that's affordable and doable?

378
00:14:37.061 --> 00:14:38.495
Just for cars, we're just looking

379
00:14:38.495 --> 00:14:39.897
at transportation right now.

380
00:14:39.897 --> 00:14:41.232
<v ->If we're talking near future,</v>

381
00:14:41.232 --> 00:14:43.717
the near future we really foresee, our institute foresees

382
00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:46.036
the electric car becoming a mainstay.

383
00:14:46.036 --> 00:14:49.173
It's interesting to me to find that GM

384
00:14:49.173 --> 00:14:51.876
produced the electric car and then destroyed all of them

385
00:14:51.876 --> 00:14:55.012
because they were competition to the gasoline burners.

386
00:14:55.012 --> 00:14:57.481
And a conflict of interest for their own company.

387
00:14:57.481 --> 00:15:00.017
<v Voiceover>Yes, it killed the electric car.</v>

388
00:15:00.017 --> 00:15:02.120
I think we have that posted on our site.

389
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.922
Everybody should watch that film by the way.

390
00:15:03.922 --> 00:15:06.090
<v ->Okay, I'm glad 'cause we had Chelsea Sexton</v>

391
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.960
as the star of the show that

392
00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.329
explained problems she experienced.

393
00:15:10.329 --> 00:15:13.797
But suffice it to say this is actually a good sign.

394
00:15:13.797 --> 00:15:15.632
I suffered the same thing in 99

395
00:15:15.632 --> 00:15:17.835
when I had my first conference on future energy.

396
00:15:17.835 --> 00:15:19.236
I got fired from the patent office

397
00:15:19.236 --> 00:15:23.407
and was really disparagingly

398
00:15:23.407 --> 00:15:25.075
attacked by every media.

399
00:15:25.075 --> 00:15:27.912
<v Voiceover>Because you presented at this conference?</v>

400
00:15:27.912 --> 00:15:29.013
<v ->I organized the conference.</v>

401
00:15:29.013 --> 00:15:30.447
It was supposed to be at the

402
00:15:30.447 --> 00:15:31.816
state department at Washington D.C.,

403
00:15:31.816 --> 00:15:33.117
planned for a whole year.

404
00:15:33.117 --> 00:15:35.252
And then a certain Dr. Zimmerman decided

405
00:15:35.252 --> 00:15:36.587
to interfere and say "Oh we're gonna have

406
00:15:36.587 --> 00:15:39.156
"peer review of your papers" a month

407
00:15:39.156 --> 00:15:41.575
before it was scheduled to occur.

408
00:15:42.559 --> 00:15:43.928
No peer review ever happened.

409
00:15:43.928 --> 00:15:47.197
He just decided to discount every speaker that I had.

410
00:15:47.197 --> 00:15:49.300
And unfortunately even when I tried to go back

411
00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.502
to the commerce department where I work,

412
00:15:51.502 --> 00:15:54.005
seeing if the auditorium was available,

413
00:15:54.005 --> 00:15:56.841
that became the cause of my dismissal.

414
00:15:56.841 --> 00:15:59.277
Because they accused me of conflict of interest

415
00:15:59.277 --> 00:16:03.870
and misrepresentation.

416
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:05.249
But the good thing that came out of it,

417
00:16:05.249 --> 00:16:07.084
I'm trying to draw a parallel here,

418
00:16:07.084 --> 00:16:09.086
is that when you initially experience

419
00:16:09.086 --> 00:16:11.122
what Russ George is experiencing as well,

420
00:16:11.122 --> 00:16:13.891
the original irrational opposition that's

421
00:16:13.891 --> 00:16:18.028
very strong and very intense and unexpected.

422
00:16:18.028 --> 00:16:20.998
Surprisingly I found a rebound.

423
00:16:20.998 --> 00:16:22.933
I regained my job, I got back pay,

424
00:16:22.933 --> 00:16:25.936
a bigger chunk of back pay than anyone else.

425
00:16:25.936 --> 00:16:28.305
Six years of fighting the patent office.

426
00:16:28.305 --> 00:16:30.574
But I learned a lot, got my PhD while I was out.

427
00:16:30.574 --> 00:16:33.310
And also benefited so much so

428
00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:36.080
that I met the director who saw my dismissal case

429
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.115
and said, "I don't see anything wrong with this,

430
00:16:38.115 --> 00:16:40.684
"must be political," why I was being fired.

431
00:16:40.684 --> 00:16:43.020
And so director Allen Smith said,

432
00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.691
"I'm gonna try to form a technology forum on the same

433
00:16:46.691 --> 00:16:50.294
"format that Tom Valone was actually organizing."

434
00:16:50.294 --> 00:16:51.595
The very next year.

435
00:16:51.595 --> 00:16:53.198
And so every year since then,

436
00:16:53.198 --> 00:16:55.353
my dream is actually perpetuated through the patent office.

437
00:16:55.353 --> 00:16:56.501
<v Voiceover>That's fabulous.</v>

438
00:16:56.501 --> 00:16:57.703
(both laugh)

439
00:16:57.703 --> 00:16:59.470
Well let's look at some of that technology then,

440
00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.238
you're talking about the electric car.

441
00:17:01.238 --> 00:17:03.675
It was around 100 years ago.

442
00:17:03.675 --> 00:17:05.076
<v ->Yeah, this is an archetypal perception</v>

443
00:17:05.076 --> 00:17:07.377
that yeah it's been suppressed twice now.

444
00:17:07.377 --> 00:17:09.380
And so that to me is a good sign.

445
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.415
Because when I take a union approach

446
00:17:11.415 --> 00:17:14.494
of archetypal significance here the

447
00:17:14.494 --> 00:17:16.687
negative forces, the shadow,

448
00:17:16.687 --> 00:17:18.490
whatever you want to call it is trying

449
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:21.258
to suppress something of great good,

450
00:17:21.258 --> 00:17:23.243
of general goodness and light.

451
00:17:23.243 --> 00:17:28.198
And also not having the fire associated

452
00:17:28.198 --> 00:17:30.335
with the fossil fuel burning.

453
00:17:30.335 --> 00:17:32.235
When you look at air, earth, fire, and water,

454
00:17:32.235 --> 00:17:35.438
as potential sources of energy.

455
00:17:35.438 --> 00:17:38.876
Air and water perhaps are some of the ones

456
00:17:38.876 --> 00:17:40.511
that we should be looking at.

457
00:17:40.511 --> 00:17:43.814
So anyways, the significance is that the electric

458
00:17:43.814 --> 00:17:46.483
car now with the Tesla Roadster

459
00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:49.052
actually uses a whole series of thousands

460
00:17:49.052 --> 00:17:51.020
of small lithium batteries.

461
00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.857
And I do a Future Energy E-News

462
00:17:53.857 --> 00:17:56.193
that anyone can subscribe to if they like for free.

463
00:17:56.193 --> 00:17:57.462
<v Voiceover>Oh we'll have a link to that here.</v>

464
00:17:57.462 --> 00:18:00.197
<v ->Every month they send out and this month,</v>

465
00:18:00.197 --> 00:18:04.869
I reprinted an article that actually describes

466
00:18:04.869 --> 00:18:07.138
the companies that make the lithium batteries.

467
00:18:07.138 --> 00:18:08.639
<v Voiceover>So the technology exists?</v>

468
00:18:08.639 --> 00:18:10.242
<v ->Not only exists, they've improved it.</v>

469
00:18:10.242 --> 00:18:11.543
<v Voiceover>And they've improved it.</v>

470
00:18:11.543 --> 00:18:12.477
<v ->Yeah they've improved it.</v>

471
00:18:12.477 --> 00:18:14.144
<v Voiceover>And now the piece here that seems</v>

472
00:18:14.144 --> 00:18:17.114
to hang things up is it actually affordable

473
00:18:17.114 --> 00:18:20.218
for use in cars?

474
00:18:20.218 --> 00:18:21.953
<v ->Well see, we're talking the near future.</v>

475
00:18:21.953 --> 00:18:24.756
And I'm trying to give a five 10 year type of,

476
00:18:24.756 --> 00:18:28.559
let's say 10 years time frame for the near future scenario.

477
00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:32.396
That yes, we are going to see not only electric cars

478
00:18:32.396 --> 00:18:36.016
but solar powered recharging stations.

479
00:18:36.834 --> 00:18:38.802
And there's four major improvements

480
00:18:38.802 --> 00:18:42.539
in solar energy electro photovoltaics

481
00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:45.543
that have now surfaced in various laboratories.

482
00:18:45.543 --> 00:18:47.945
Even the number of photons you can generate.

483
00:18:47.945 --> 00:18:49.980
I'm sorry, the number of electrons

484
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.548
you can generate per photon.

485
00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:52.884
Now it's one to one.

486
00:18:52.884 --> 00:18:54.985
And Los Alamos has discovered they can

487
00:18:54.985 --> 00:18:58.688
actually produce two or three on each photon coming in.

488
00:18:58.688 --> 00:18:59.423
<v Voiceover>Good news.</v>

489
00:18:59.423 --> 00:19:02.192
<v ->There are photovoltaics just discovered</v>

490
00:19:02.192 --> 00:19:06.364
in all of Versaille that work on infrared as well.

491
00:19:06.364 --> 00:19:08.966
And you don't need sunlight.

492
00:19:08.966 --> 00:19:10.401
To generate electricity.

493
00:19:10.401 --> 00:19:14.072
<v Voiceover>About 15 years ago I saw a little documentary,</v>

494
00:19:14.072 --> 00:19:15.305
I think it was called The Pheonix Project,

495
00:19:15.305 --> 00:19:19.076
or something when I was doing environmental news reporting.

496
00:19:19.076 --> 00:19:20.577
And they were showing the prototypes

497
00:19:20.577 --> 00:19:24.148
from both BMW and Mercedes of

498
00:19:24.148 --> 00:19:27.985
their cars that were running on hydrogen cells

499
00:19:27.985 --> 00:19:31.422
that were powered by the sun, solar hydrogen.

500
00:19:31.422 --> 00:19:32.623
What about that technology?

501
00:19:32.623 --> 00:19:34.191
What happened to that?

502
00:19:34.191 --> 00:19:37.494
Was it just too volatile or expensive to continue,

503
00:19:37.494 --> 00:19:39.196
or have they continued?

504
00:19:39.196 --> 00:19:42.599
<v ->I've seen so many negative articles about hydrogen</v>

505
00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:44.968
that even though I subscribe and have

506
00:19:44.968 --> 00:19:47.872
reprinted articles about solar hydrogen,

507
00:19:47.872 --> 00:19:50.941
to me it's still a boondoggle.

508
00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:53.310
Because the infrastructure you need

509
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:57.747
through any city or country to support an energy source.

510
00:19:57.747 --> 00:20:00.285
Like natural gas, natural gas luckily

511
00:20:00.285 --> 00:20:03.086
and over the 20 year period has introduced

512
00:20:03.086 --> 00:20:05.490
different natural gas stations

513
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:08.326
where you can refill a car or a truck

514
00:20:08.326 --> 00:20:10.194
if it's running on that fuel.

515
00:20:10.194 --> 00:20:12.863
But hydrogen doesn't have any fueling stations.

516
00:20:12.863 --> 00:20:14.748
And even when it does,

517
00:20:15.798 --> 00:20:19.069
it's very expensive to install that type of system.

518
00:20:19.069 --> 00:20:21.805
And unfortunately the major car producers

519
00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:24.608
haven't subscribed to paying for that infrastructure.

520
00:20:24.608 --> 00:20:27.311
The government would rather spend money elsewhere.

521
00:20:27.311 --> 00:20:28.912
So we really have a problem with

522
00:20:28.912 --> 00:20:32.615
hydrogen implications and installations.

523
00:20:32.615 --> 00:20:34.217
The other problem with hydrogen too

524
00:20:34.217 --> 00:20:36.988
is that you're dealing with another fire explosive

525
00:20:36.988 --> 00:20:38.221
type of mixture.

526
00:20:38.221 --> 00:20:41.259
It's nice that it has water as a byproduct,

527
00:20:41.259 --> 00:20:44.795
but still, we have a refilling issue.

528
00:20:44.795 --> 00:20:47.864
And the refilling issue is just as urgent

529
00:20:47.864 --> 00:20:49.133
as the gasoline issue.

530
00:20:49.133 --> 00:20:51.269
I'm getting empty, where's the next station?

531
00:20:52.069 --> 00:20:53.938
That can't be a very compatible future

532
00:20:53.938 --> 00:20:55.839
image for the 21st century.

533
00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:56.973
<v Voiceover>Right, so you're looking instead</v>

534
00:20:56.973 --> 00:20:58.809
at solar powered electric?

535
00:20:58.809 --> 00:20:59.643
<v ->Right.</v>

536
00:20:59.643 --> 00:21:01.244
<v Voiceover>Which that does make a lot of sense.</v>

537
00:21:01.244 --> 00:21:02.280
<v ->For the near term.</v>

538
00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.847
<v Voiceover>It's in the near future.</v>

539
00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:05.682
What would happen, I don't know if you

540
00:21:05.682 --> 00:21:08.086
have any of these stats or can even extrapolate

541
00:21:08.086 --> 00:21:09.653
from what knowledge you have.

542
00:21:09.653 --> 00:21:13.990
If we were to say within five years go hybrid.

543
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:15.693
The newer technologies in hybrid

544
00:21:15.693 --> 00:21:17.731
which has improved battery power already.

545
00:21:17.731 --> 00:21:20.798
Prius is getting ready to release the 2009

546
00:21:20.798 --> 00:21:23.717
at the end of the year and they're

547
00:21:23.717 --> 00:21:25.837
touting that at 80 miles a gallon.

548
00:21:25.837 --> 00:21:28.406
Which realistically means we have a Prius.

549
00:21:28.406 --> 00:21:30.776
Realistically means probably 65 or 70.

550
00:21:30.776 --> 00:21:32.176
That's still pretty good.

551
00:21:32.176 --> 00:21:35.947
Not as good as this little jet car at 120 miles a gallon.

552
00:21:35.947 --> 00:21:39.082
But what would happen there just with the

553
00:21:39.082 --> 00:21:41.985
cleanliness of the system?

554
00:21:41.985 --> 00:21:45.890
<v ->Oh absolutely, you'd get literally about 50% improvements.</v>

555
00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:47.323
The studies have already been done.

556
00:21:47.323 --> 00:21:50.760
The government, the DOE, EIA have made predictions.

557
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.129
You can save millions of tons of CO2.

558
00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:56.234
So it's a very favorable direction to go.

559
00:21:56.234 --> 00:21:58.602
I think the car industries are already

560
00:21:58.602 --> 00:22:00.303
forced to go in that direction

561
00:22:00.303 --> 00:22:02.272
because of the foreign influences.

562
00:22:02.272 --> 00:22:04.108
You know, Japan and many other countries

563
00:22:04.108 --> 00:22:06.811
have surpassed the mileage that we're

564
00:22:06.811 --> 00:22:08.545
experiencing in this country.

565
00:22:08.545 --> 00:22:10.914
So the urgency to stay in business

566
00:22:10.914 --> 00:22:12.648
is very important to them.

567
00:22:12.648 --> 00:22:15.852
So hybrid's definitely are a near future experience.

568
00:22:15.852 --> 00:22:17.555
The other thing I should point out though

569
00:22:17.555 --> 00:22:20.991
is that there are cars called theaircar.com.

570
00:22:20.991 --> 00:22:22.592
<v Voiceover>Right, the air car I was going to ask you--</v>

571
00:22:22.592 --> 00:22:24.935
<v ->Which is also developing a hybrid.</v>

572
00:22:24.935 --> 00:22:27.031
And then you've got no fuel at all to worry about.

573
00:22:27.031 --> 00:22:29.132
Except for running that little charger

574
00:22:29.132 --> 00:22:30.401
which could even be electric.

575
00:22:30.401 --> 00:22:31.368
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about it.</v>

576
00:22:31.368 --> 00:22:33.237
Explain a little bit without getting too technical

577
00:22:33.237 --> 00:22:34.438
about the air car.

578
00:22:34.438 --> 00:22:35.973
<v ->Oh the air car's real simple.</v>

579
00:22:35.973 --> 00:22:38.643
You just use compressed air into the tank

580
00:22:38.643 --> 00:22:42.212
and you're running the pistons on compressed air.

581
00:22:43.032 --> 00:22:43.813
<v Voiceover>Simple.</v>

582
00:22:43.813 --> 00:22:45.783
<v ->And actually the one in Australia uses</v>

583
00:22:45.783 --> 00:22:48.585
a rotary wankel design which is even more efficient

584
00:22:48.585 --> 00:22:50.420
and reduces an engine like this down

585
00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.689
to half the size and half the weight.

586
00:22:52.689 --> 00:22:54.758
So the compressed air business,

587
00:22:54.758 --> 00:22:57.805
even though at this time it's a short

588
00:22:57.805 --> 00:23:00.564
few hundred mile type of estimate

589
00:23:00.564 --> 00:23:02.399
on per tank full,

590
00:23:02.399 --> 00:23:05.136
you can still carry the compressor with you.

591
00:23:05.136 --> 00:23:08.471
And then the hope is for the Air Car company

592
00:23:08.471 --> 00:23:11.875
to and actually the current project is

593
00:23:11.875 --> 00:23:15.545
to provide a hybrid that will actually power the compressor.

594
00:23:15.545 --> 00:23:18.983
And they're planning to have a car go across Australia

595
00:23:18.983 --> 00:23:21.718
one whatever tank full they would provide.

596
00:23:21.718 --> 00:23:22.886
<v Voiceover>So that's exciting.</v>

597
00:23:22.886 --> 00:23:25.455
So now how far off do you see that technology?

598
00:23:25.455 --> 00:23:27.224
<v ->Oh that's definitely a five 10 year--</v>

599
00:23:27.224 --> 00:23:28.660
<v Voiceover>A five to 10 year also.</v>

600
00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.595
<v ->The air car luckily is available in many countries.</v>

601
00:23:31.595 --> 00:23:33.397
Except for the U.S. so far.

602
00:23:33.397 --> 00:23:34.565
<v Voiceover>Okay yeah.</v>

603
00:23:34.565 --> 00:23:36.533
And right now, I mean the hassle people

604
00:23:36.533 --> 00:23:38.835
have to go to to convert their car to electric

605
00:23:38.835 --> 00:23:40.838
with the old battery technology

606
00:23:40.838 --> 00:23:43.473
certainly has been somewhat prohibitive and clumsy.

607
00:23:43.473 --> 00:23:46.142
So within you say, five to 10 years we can

608
00:23:46.142 --> 00:23:48.778
be looking at electric even solar electric.

609
00:23:48.778 --> 00:23:50.747
And we can also be looking at the air car

610
00:23:50.747 --> 00:23:53.116
in the interim, the hybrids.

611
00:23:54.206 --> 00:23:56.219
One of the hybrids is probably the best way to go

612
00:23:56.219 --> 00:23:58.054
until that window shows up where we can

613
00:23:58.054 --> 00:24:00.423
start purchasing these other technologies.

614
00:24:00.423 --> 00:24:03.160
<v ->Especially for the environmentally conscious consumer.</v>

615
00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.161
<v Voiceover>Okay, speaking of the air car,</v>

616
00:24:05.161 --> 00:24:07.564
Stanley Myers, this is an incredible story.

617
00:24:07.564 --> 00:24:10.033
He's passed away in the last several months.

618
00:24:10.033 --> 00:24:12.236
Incredible, it appeared everyone was excited

619
00:24:12.236 --> 00:24:14.571
about his invention.

620
00:24:14.571 --> 00:24:18.542
Now you talked to Stanley before he passed away.

621
00:24:18.542 --> 00:24:20.111
What happened?

622
00:24:20.111 --> 00:24:22.746
What happened to him when he tried to get this out?

623
00:24:22.746 --> 00:24:25.515
<v ->Well, Stan Myers told me at that dinner</v>

624
00:24:25.515 --> 00:24:27.484
when we had dinner at a conference

625
00:24:27.484 --> 00:24:31.188
that he had the experience of applying for a patent

626
00:24:31.188 --> 00:24:33.089
on a car that would run on water.

627
00:24:33.089 --> 00:24:35.692
And the interesting thing was his invention

628
00:24:35.692 --> 00:24:40.397
was designed to provide an easy,

629
00:24:40.397 --> 00:24:42.966
low energy electrolysis of water.

630
00:24:42.966 --> 00:24:45.302
And by doing that he'd be supplying

631
00:24:45.302 --> 00:24:48.404
the cylinders of a standard engine

632
00:24:48.404 --> 00:24:51.140
with the hydrogen necessary to combust.

633
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.708
Hydrogen and oxygen are necessary

634
00:24:52.708 --> 00:24:54.645
to combust and recombine.

635
00:24:54.645 --> 00:24:56.147
And it just requires a little bit

636
00:24:56.147 --> 00:24:57.948
of change in the carburetor.

637
00:24:57.948 --> 00:25:00.316
So the patent application was in

638
00:25:00.316 --> 00:25:02.753
and all of a sudden he gets a call from the Pentagon

639
00:25:02.753 --> 00:25:05.988
saying that he has to come to the Pentagon the next day.

640
00:25:05.988 --> 00:25:10.493
And he refused and luckily he was

641
00:25:10.493 --> 00:25:13.131
a former military person who had experience

642
00:25:13.131 --> 00:25:16.501
with their techniques or their traditions.

643
00:25:16.501 --> 00:25:19.971
But then a couple Pentagon people showed up

644
00:25:19.971 --> 00:25:22.272
at his door the next day, so he had to go with them.

645
00:25:22.272 --> 00:25:24.040
<v Voiceover>He didn't have a choice.</v>

646
00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:24.976
<v ->Exactly.</v>

647
00:25:24.976 --> 00:25:27.777
So the interesting confrontation was that,

648
00:25:27.777 --> 00:25:30.848
and I forgot the type of the rank that was

649
00:25:30.848 --> 00:25:33.951
maybe a general or whoever the important

650
00:25:33.951 --> 00:25:37.021
Pentagon official was that was confronting him.

651
00:25:37.021 --> 00:25:38.922
They explained to him that his patent

652
00:25:38.922 --> 00:25:40.490
was going to be secretized.

653
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:43.160
And this is a standard procedure for something

654
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.763
that has national interest and also over 4,000

655
00:25:46.763 --> 00:25:49.499
patents have suffered that at the patent office already.

656
00:25:49.499 --> 00:25:51.135
<v Voiceover>What does this mean when they're secretized?</v>

657
00:25:51.135 --> 00:25:52.403
<v ->Well they end up in a vault</v>

658
00:25:52.403 --> 00:25:54.472
and they sit there for at least 50 years.

659
00:25:54.472 --> 00:25:55.373
<v Voiceover>And why were they going</v>

660
00:25:55.373 --> 00:25:56.806
to do this to his technology?

661
00:25:56.806 --> 00:25:57.842
Did they explain?

662
00:25:57.842 --> 00:26:00.912
<v ->Yeah, and actually in their particular point of view,</v>

663
00:26:00.912 --> 00:26:02.779
the Pentagon felt that they wanted to use

664
00:26:02.779 --> 00:26:05.583
this technology for their own military vehicles.

665
00:26:05.583 --> 00:26:10.088
And he explained that if they keep it secret for themselves,

666
00:26:10.088 --> 00:26:14.125
then the rest of the world will also get ahead of us.

667
00:26:14.995 --> 00:26:17.194
Stan Meyers was very strategic in his

668
00:26:17.194 --> 00:26:21.231
description of the political and the military disadvantage

669
00:26:21.231 --> 00:26:24.000
that will result from that one sided unilateral

670
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.269
approach to deprive the United States

671
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:28.272
of this technology and yet the rest of the world

672
00:26:28.272 --> 00:26:29.907
still has access to it.

673
00:26:29.907 --> 00:26:31.941
And he explained for some reason that his

674
00:26:31.941 --> 00:26:34.813
patent application or his papers,

675
00:26:34.813 --> 00:26:36.680
something had already been released.

676
00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.582
Much like Ken Shoulders did.

677
00:26:38.582 --> 00:26:40.650
Ken Shoulders used the exact same technique

678
00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:44.687
when the military officials arrived at his door.

679
00:26:44.687 --> 00:26:46.324
<v Voiceover>Explain Ken Shoulders.</v>

680
00:26:46.324 --> 00:26:50.693
<v ->Well Ken Shoulders had one of the top rated</v>

681
00:26:52.296 --> 00:26:56.099
national interest invention for several years

682
00:26:56.099 --> 00:26:57.567
on the DIA list.

683
00:26:57.567 --> 00:27:01.805
And this is recounted in the book by Taggart.

684
00:27:02.845 --> 00:27:05.042
It's a field type of book.

685
00:27:05.042 --> 00:27:07.610
A very interesting interview with Shoulders had put off--

686
00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:09.145
<v Voiceover>Taggart you're talking about in the field?</v>

687
00:27:09.145 --> 00:27:10.780
Yes we have an interview with her.

688
00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.182
<v ->And her book recounts this exact story.</v>

689
00:27:13.182 --> 00:27:15.486
So when I heard it from Ken Shoulders

690
00:27:15.486 --> 00:27:17.487
I didn't know it had already been documented.

691
00:27:17.487 --> 00:27:20.156
But Ken's approach was he knew that

692
00:27:20.156 --> 00:27:22.659
if you get some record,

693
00:27:22.659 --> 00:27:25.862
like a notebook or an actual published book

694
00:27:25.862 --> 00:27:27.564
out of the country,

695
00:27:27.564 --> 00:27:29.499
then when they show up at the door

696
00:27:29.499 --> 00:27:32.536
to give you the papers of your invention being classified,

697
00:27:32.536 --> 00:27:35.606
you basically just tell them too late.

698
00:27:35.606 --> 00:27:36.706
And he did.

699
00:27:36.706 --> 00:27:40.211
And unfortunately the military official got red in the face

700
00:27:40.211 --> 00:27:41.578
and extremely angry.

701
00:27:41.578 --> 00:27:42.812
(Thomas laughs)

702
00:27:42.812 --> 00:27:45.148
<v Voiceover>No kidding, well Stanley's not here anymore.</v>

703
00:27:45.148 --> 00:27:46.716
<v ->Right, yeah.</v>

704
00:27:46.716 --> 00:27:50.354
But the issue was there that he did convince them,

705
00:27:50.354 --> 00:27:53.322
Stanley Myers did convince the Pentagon official

706
00:27:53.322 --> 00:27:55.492
not to classify that particular invention.

707
00:27:55.492 --> 00:27:57.226
He did receive the patent.

708
00:27:57.226 --> 00:27:59.296
Unfortunately he didn't get too many people

709
00:27:59.296 --> 00:28:03.367
to market it or to buy the license to produce it.

710
00:28:03.367 --> 00:28:05.503
And there's a lot of conspiracy stories

711
00:28:05.503 --> 00:28:08.072
of even his last day when he had dinner

712
00:28:08.072 --> 00:28:09.941
with someone that he was negotiating

713
00:28:09.941 --> 00:28:11.576
to license the invention

714
00:28:11.576 --> 00:28:14.444
and he ran out of the restaurant saying he's been poisoned.

715
00:28:14.444 --> 00:28:17.514
So who knows what happened to Stan Myers.

716
00:28:17.514 --> 00:28:19.616
<v Voiceover>But this is not an unusual story by the way.</v>

717
00:28:19.616 --> 00:28:20.550
<v ->I believe you're right.
<v Voiceover>There are people</v>

718
00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:22.119
<v Voiceover>who have come up with these exotic,</v>

719
00:28:22.119 --> 00:28:24.955
not exotic alternative technologies and inventions.

720
00:28:24.955 --> 00:28:28.625
Anything that seems to cut in on big oil.

721
00:28:28.625 --> 00:28:29.659
<v ->Right.</v>

722
00:28:29.659 --> 00:28:31.762
<v Voiceover>Seems to have very interesting stories</v>

723
00:28:31.762 --> 00:28:32.962
attached to it.

724
00:28:32.962 --> 00:28:36.533
And that is the sad part of this legacy to this point.

725
00:28:36.533 --> 00:28:39.236
So I don't know the answer to that

726
00:28:39.236 --> 00:28:41.237
and other than that we have to collectively

727
00:28:41.237 --> 00:28:43.072
somehow manifest this.

728
00:28:44.502 --> 00:28:46.342
And I don't know the answer to how

729
00:28:46.342 --> 00:28:47.945
we overcome these obstacles.

730
00:28:47.945 --> 00:28:50.047
<v ->Yeah, I even saw this personally</v>

731
00:28:50.047 --> 00:28:51.948
at a Tesla conference years ago.

732
00:28:51.948 --> 00:28:53.216
About 10 years ago.

733
00:28:53.216 --> 00:28:56.988
And I haven't kept

734
00:28:56.988 --> 00:28:59.556
in touch with the PhD who was giving the lecture,

735
00:28:59.556 --> 00:29:02.793
but he was interpreting Henry Maury's invention.

736
00:29:02.793 --> 00:29:04.461
And he had discovered how to produce

737
00:29:04.461 --> 00:29:06.630
the Henry Maury invention which is a

738
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:09.266
free energy devise that needs to be powered

739
00:29:09.266 --> 00:29:12.503
just by a small nuclear source like a beta source.

740
00:29:12.503 --> 00:29:14.904
But the fascinating thing was that he was

741
00:29:14.904 --> 00:29:17.175
ready to give the talk and someone is pulling

742
00:29:17.175 --> 00:29:18.875
on his shirt sleeves telling him,

743
00:29:18.875 --> 00:29:20.009
"No you can't give this talk.

744
00:29:20.009 --> 00:29:21.478
"No you can't give the talk."

745
00:29:21.478 --> 00:29:23.112
And the interesting thing is as this

746
00:29:23.112 --> 00:29:24.648
rumor started going around he told a

747
00:29:24.648 --> 00:29:26.682
few people who this person was.

748
00:29:26.682 --> 00:29:28.851
He had already shown a fake CIA badge

749
00:29:28.851 --> 00:29:30.520
at the registration desk.

750
00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.989
(Both laugh)

751
00:29:31.989 --> 00:29:33.089
<v Voiceover>Interesting.</v>

752
00:29:34.989 --> 00:29:36.360
<v ->You never know where they're coming from</v>

753
00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:40.964
but most likely is one of the fossil fuel industries

754
00:29:40.964 --> 00:29:43.033
that have plenty of money even as the

755
00:29:43.033 --> 00:29:45.901
American Petroleum Institute had had for about

756
00:29:45.901 --> 00:29:47.888
eight years now.

757
00:29:48.905 --> 00:29:50.640
To fund the media stories that would

758
00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.142
counteract climate change stories.

759
00:29:53.142 --> 00:29:54.112
And they were successful,

760
00:29:54.112 --> 00:29:55.812
they actually discovered a memo

761
00:29:55.812 --> 00:29:58.915
that Al Gore has now circulated and others have

762
00:29:58.915 --> 00:30:02.519
successfully obtained when there is confusion

763
00:30:02.519 --> 00:30:05.255
in the perception of climate change.

764
00:30:05.255 --> 00:30:07.457
<v Voiceover>That's it, just information campaign</v>

765
00:30:07.457 --> 00:30:08.825
they abound everywhere.

766
00:30:08.825 --> 00:30:10.460
Especially around this subject.

767
00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:13.236
So yeah, that's very interesting.

768
00:30:13.236 --> 00:30:16.933
Let's look at going beyond that into.

769
00:30:16.933 --> 00:30:19.970
I wanna talk a little bit more about photovoltaic cells

770
00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:22.038
because you mention there's this new technology

771
00:30:22.038 --> 00:30:23.839
that's coming through right now.

772
00:30:23.839 --> 00:30:26.375
We've wanted to do this for along time

773
00:30:26.375 --> 00:30:28.044
to take the house off the grid.

774
00:30:28.044 --> 00:30:30.146
But the last time anyone gave us an estimate

775
00:30:30.146 --> 00:30:33.783
it's still $30,000 to make that conversion.

776
00:30:33.783 --> 00:30:36.186
At what point, again, how far out in the future

777
00:30:36.186 --> 00:30:38.622
do you see it where we can affordably

778
00:30:38.622 --> 00:30:40.290
start making these conversions

779
00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:43.326
or even add them to new construction, build them in?

780
00:30:43.326 --> 00:30:45.828
<v ->Well, actually, the technology's available today</v>

781
00:30:45.828 --> 00:30:48.364
and the exciting thing is that there are

782
00:30:48.364 --> 00:30:50.701
concentrated solar and also the

783
00:30:50.701 --> 00:30:53.236
plastic solars.

784
00:30:55.216 --> 00:30:58.675
I'm trying to picture the name because I'm a visual person,

785
00:30:58.675 --> 00:30:59.843
but it starts with a K.

786
00:30:59.843 --> 00:31:02.146
It's something like kah-roh-lah or kah-no-lah.

787
00:31:02.146 --> 00:31:04.246
<v Voiceover>My brain works like yours.</v>

788
00:31:04.246 --> 00:31:06.448
<v ->Kah-nih-kah, I think it's Kah-nih-kah perhaps.</v>

789
00:31:06.448 --> 00:31:08.684
But the company is on my website.

790
00:31:08.684 --> 00:31:11.487
It's one of the recent e-news stories.

791
00:31:11.487 --> 00:31:14.424
And they now produce a plastic

792
00:31:14.424 --> 00:31:17.560
formable type of photovoltaic that absorbs

793
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.196
the infrared and actually is very affordable.

794
00:31:20.196 --> 00:31:22.200
And the interesting thing is if you're looking

795
00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.833
at kilowatts or generation,

796
00:31:23.833 --> 00:31:26.869
you're looking at only an investment,

797
00:31:26.869 --> 00:31:29.356
capital investment of maybe $10,000.

798
00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:31.974
In a pay back of about three years.

799
00:31:31.974 --> 00:31:33.943
<v Voiceover>Considerable improvement.</v>

800
00:31:33.943 --> 00:31:36.478
And now, even looking at that for,

801
00:31:36.478 --> 00:31:38.648
say if we start having some issues,

802
00:31:38.648 --> 00:31:39.749
brown outs and so forth.

803
00:31:39.749 --> 00:31:42.553
If we start having some disruptions in systems

804
00:31:42.553 --> 00:31:45.154
and if it all ties into the economy

805
00:31:45.154 --> 00:31:46.289
and other things of course.

806
00:31:46.289 --> 00:31:47.590
But if we start having brown outs,

807
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:50.026
certainly one of the big problems is, for example,

808
00:31:50.026 --> 00:31:52.829
you lose the food in your refrigerator and your freezer.

809
00:31:52.829 --> 00:31:56.033
And are there smaller systems that are available

810
00:31:56.033 --> 00:31:58.469
just to even if you could just power your

811
00:31:58.469 --> 00:32:00.337
refrigeration source for example,

812
00:32:00.337 --> 00:32:03.975
or if you have a well, the well pump source.

813
00:32:03.975 --> 00:32:05.041
Things like this.

814
00:32:05.041 --> 00:32:06.375
<v ->Well that's a very good point you made.</v>

815
00:32:06.375 --> 00:32:08.779
And in fact if there are people considering

816
00:32:08.779 --> 00:32:10.948
getting one foot in the door

817
00:32:10.948 --> 00:32:13.284
that will be the best thing to design.

818
00:32:13.284 --> 00:32:16.152
Is simply a backup system that would work for a day.

819
00:32:17.182 --> 00:32:20.924
And so you're not perhaps designing

820
00:32:20.924 --> 00:32:23.227
the system to run the whole house forever,

821
00:32:23.227 --> 00:32:25.395
but just the major utilities.

822
00:32:25.395 --> 00:32:27.431
I mean the appliances that you rely upon.

823
00:32:27.431 --> 00:32:30.668
And if it's either the furnace or the air conditioner

824
00:32:30.668 --> 00:32:34.737
and the refrigerator, those kilowatt demands

825
00:32:34.737 --> 00:32:38.374
perhaps will be sizeably smaller wattage

826
00:32:38.374 --> 00:32:40.076
that needs to be addressed.

827
00:32:40.076 --> 00:32:42.512
And so just addressing that with some

828
00:32:42.512 --> 00:32:44.448
battery backup systems.

829
00:32:44.448 --> 00:32:47.250
We use UPS all the time for our computers.

830
00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:49.218
Because in the Washington D.C area we tend

831
00:32:49.218 --> 00:32:50.788
to have little glitches that will cause

832
00:32:50.788 --> 00:32:53.490
the computer to reset and you lose the data.

833
00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:56.626
So computer users are used to having backups

834
00:32:56.626 --> 00:32:58.462
but home users haven't thought about it

835
00:32:58.462 --> 00:33:01.164
until you get a week long blackout.

836
00:33:01.164 --> 00:33:03.166
Which we've had in the D.C. area too

837
00:33:03.166 --> 00:33:05.235
and other places throughout the country.

838
00:33:05.235 --> 00:33:07.237
I kept one newspaper article where a million

839
00:33:07.237 --> 00:33:10.307
people were without electricity because of some storm.

840
00:33:10.307 --> 00:33:12.209
I thought "This has gotta change."

841
00:33:12.209 --> 00:33:14.011
Because it's bad enough to get a storm

842
00:33:14.011 --> 00:33:16.480
that makes all kinds of damage to your home and property,

843
00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.414
like hurricanes in Florida.

844
00:33:18.414 --> 00:33:20.018
Regular occurrences all the time.

845
00:33:20.018 --> 00:33:21.917
And of course then you have to lose

846
00:33:21.917 --> 00:33:23.553
your electricity on top of that?

847
00:33:23.553 --> 00:33:24.654
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

848
00:33:24.654 --> 00:33:26.123
<v ->This is not modern society.</v>

849
00:33:26.123 --> 00:33:27.490
<v Voiceover>Right, no, no, that does sound</v>

850
00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:30.694
pretty primitive that we become that dependant on it.

851
00:33:30.694 --> 00:33:32.194
<v ->To compound the problem.</v>

852
00:33:32.194 --> 00:33:33.981
<v Voiceover>Yes, to compound the problem.</v>

853
00:33:34.964 --> 00:33:37.401
So people can go to your site and they can find

854
00:33:37.401 --> 00:33:39.603
kah-nah-kah or kah-nah-koh or something like that.

855
00:33:39.603 --> 00:33:40.836
<v ->Kahr-nih-ka, yeah I believe it's the--</v>

856
00:33:40.836 --> 00:33:42.004
<v Voiceover>Whatever, to see--</v>

857
00:33:42.004 --> 00:33:44.440
<v ->But to tell you the truth there are</v>

858
00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.609
experts in the field such as Home Power magazine.

859
00:33:46.609 --> 00:33:49.111
I direct people to Home Power all the time.

860
00:33:49.111 --> 00:33:51.046
I love their work and it's so practical.

861
00:33:51.046 --> 00:33:52.782
You open up the magazine, here's the article,

862
00:33:52.782 --> 00:33:53.950
and here's how to do it.

863
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:54.917
<v Voiceover>Oh very good.</v>

864
00:33:54.917 --> 00:33:56.085
<v ->And here's where to buy the stuff.</v>

865
00:33:56.085 --> 00:33:57.120
<v Voiceover>Dot com I take it?</v>

866
00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.188
<v ->Yup, homepower.com.</v>

867
00:33:58.188 --> 00:33:59.455
<v Voiceover>Okay, I've got that written down here.</v>

868
00:33:59.455 --> 00:34:01.323
Let's go into some of the more

869
00:34:01.323 --> 00:34:03.125
as they call them exotic technologies.

870
00:34:03.125 --> 00:34:04.760
And one you're intimately familiar with

871
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.197
because you've written a book on it, "Zero Point Energy."

872
00:34:07.197 --> 00:34:10.332
This is really exciting in terms of a view of our,

873
00:34:10.332 --> 00:34:12.537
maybe a little bit further out futures

874
00:34:12.537 --> 00:34:14.137
and what the future can look like

875
00:34:14.137 --> 00:34:16.805
in terms of absolutely clean energy.

876
00:34:16.805 --> 00:34:18.408
You got to laughing and you have

877
00:34:18.408 --> 00:34:20.226
a little dampness under your eyes.

878
00:34:20.226 --> 00:34:21.978
<v ->It's an emotional issue for me.</v>

879
00:34:23.798 --> 00:34:25.347
<v Voiceover>Give us a primer on.</v>

880
00:34:25.347 --> 00:34:27.550
Do you wanna go ahead and just go like that for a sec?

881
00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:28.932
<v ->Does it help?
<v Voiceover>Both eyes.</v>

882
00:34:28.932 --> 00:34:30.420
<v Voiceover>There you go, there you go.</v>

883
00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.889
Why don't you give us a little primer on zero point energy

884
00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:35.691
and maybe even starting with that quote from Tesla.

885
00:34:35.691 --> 00:34:37.961
From I believe it was 1891.

886
00:34:37.961 --> 00:34:41.731
<v ->The interesting thing about zero point energy</v>

887
00:34:41.731 --> 00:34:44.300
is that it's an all pervading sea of energy.

888
00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.705
And really Tesla was the first to recognize

889
00:34:47.705 --> 00:34:51.340
it's existence and 1891 was when he said

890
00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:55.245
that someday we will actually run

891
00:34:55.245 --> 00:34:59.582
our vehicles by harnessing

892
00:34:59.582 --> 00:35:01.784
the very wheel work of nature.

893
00:35:01.784 --> 00:35:04.821
And he described that anywhere in the universe

894
00:35:04.821 --> 00:35:06.556
this would be accessible.

895
00:35:06.556 --> 00:35:10.260
So he had a visionary conscience.

896
00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.662
And certainly even for example,

897
00:35:12.662 --> 00:35:14.632
measured the earth's human resonance

898
00:35:14.632 --> 00:35:17.667
50 years before human got credit for doing so.

899
00:35:18.797 --> 00:35:21.037
And this is fabulous insight that he had

900
00:35:21.037 --> 00:35:23.106
even for wireless transmission of power.

901
00:35:23.106 --> 00:35:25.174
Which is a subject of my other book,

902
00:35:25.174 --> 00:35:26.977
"Harnessing the Wheel Work of Nature."

903
00:35:26.977 --> 00:35:29.311
And see, even wireless transmission

904
00:35:29.311 --> 00:35:31.514
is something that people haven't comprehended.

905
00:35:31.514 --> 00:35:34.051
Very few electrical engineers even comprehend it.

906
00:35:34.051 --> 00:35:37.420
Dr. Jim Corum who's a professor

907
00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:39.221
from West Virginia University is probably

908
00:35:39.221 --> 00:35:41.091
one of the few in the world that actually is

909
00:35:41.091 --> 00:35:42.726
an expert in that field.

910
00:35:42.726 --> 00:35:44.528
He was one of our speakers at our conference

911
00:35:44.528 --> 00:35:45.695
of future energy.

912
00:35:45.695 --> 00:35:47.264
Actually our Tesla conference.

913
00:35:47.264 --> 00:35:49.498
And to put a long story short,

914
00:35:49.498 --> 00:35:51.968
the transmission around the earth

915
00:35:51.968 --> 00:35:55.237
of any sizeable power wattage density

916
00:35:55.237 --> 00:35:58.241
that you can actually use to power appliances

917
00:35:58.241 --> 00:36:02.613
tends to be 90% 95% or higher in efficiency.

918
00:36:02.613 --> 00:36:05.949
If you're transmitting it pulsory eight hertz.

919
00:36:05.949 --> 00:36:08.953
So zero point energy" is sort of one step beyond that

920
00:36:08.953 --> 00:36:11.888
where you can even go off the earth and still access it.

921
00:36:12.778 --> 00:36:15.826
But what I find is to explain zero point energy

922
00:36:15.826 --> 00:36:18.894
is literally the little bit of quantum fluctuation

923
00:36:18.894 --> 00:36:21.332
that makes the uncertainty principle real.

924
00:36:21.332 --> 00:36:23.133
And that's the best way to explain it

925
00:36:23.133 --> 00:36:26.303
because we've all grown accustomed

926
00:36:26.303 --> 00:36:29.371
to Eisenberg's perception that there is uncertainty

927
00:36:29.371 --> 00:36:32.508
in the world and that it behaves as if you

928
00:36:32.508 --> 00:36:35.611
can't quite get an exact measurement of one distance

929
00:36:35.611 --> 00:36:39.148
and momentum or energy in time.

930
00:36:39.148 --> 00:36:42.852
And the fluctuations that are preventing that from happening

931
00:36:42.852 --> 00:36:45.755
are so fundamental that they actually

932
00:36:45.755 --> 00:36:48.724
cause fluctuations in material things.

933
00:36:48.724 --> 00:36:52.195
Such as particles, electrons, nuclei.

934
00:36:52.195 --> 00:36:54.563
And the strange thing is even liquid helium.

935
00:36:54.563 --> 00:36:58.568
I recite that as an example of proof of zero point energy.

936
00:36:58.568 --> 00:37:01.337
You try to freeze liquid helium

937
00:37:01.337 --> 00:37:03.573
even down to below one degree absolute,

938
00:37:03.573 --> 00:37:05.475
to micro degrees of absolute zero.

939
00:37:05.475 --> 00:37:07.497
And still it stays liquid.

940
00:37:07.497 --> 00:37:09.845
So zero point energy is exhibiting itself

941
00:37:09.845 --> 00:37:11.914
as a non- thermal energy that causes

942
00:37:11.914 --> 00:37:14.450
the same type of jiggling that thermal energy

943
00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:16.119
does to everything else.

944
00:37:16.119 --> 00:37:18.222
<v Voiceover>So with this energy field,</v>

945
00:37:18.222 --> 00:37:20.156
or this energy presence,

946
00:37:20.156 --> 00:37:23.059
how do you take that and convert it

947
00:37:23.059 --> 00:37:26.130
and capture whatever it converted into something

948
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:28.798
that generates propulsion systems

949
00:37:28.798 --> 00:37:31.233
or powers anything for that matter.

950
00:37:31.233 --> 00:37:35.838
How are we looking at utilizing that

951
00:37:35.838 --> 00:37:38.240
or tapping into it, harnessing it?

952
00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.611
<v ->Well that's a mixed question, loaded question,</v>

953
00:37:41.611 --> 00:37:44.114
because it covers several fields of application.

954
00:37:44.114 --> 00:37:47.050
But if I just look at the electrical energy applications,

955
00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:49.786
which is what most people desire right away,

956
00:37:50.756 --> 00:37:53.422
I answer that with how it manifests itself.

957
00:37:53.422 --> 00:37:57.492
And there are articles by Koke and Blanco

958
00:37:57.492 --> 00:37:59.762
who have actually seen and published

959
00:37:59.762 --> 00:38:02.898
journal articles from their laboratory experiments

960
00:38:02.898 --> 00:38:06.068
that have proven in semiconductors and in coils

961
00:38:06.068 --> 00:38:08.971
you can actually measure the jiggling electrons.

962
00:38:08.971 --> 00:38:11.074
Now to me this is very significant

963
00:38:11.074 --> 00:38:14.796
because even when you get to semiconductors

964
00:38:14.796 --> 00:38:16.812
there's what's called a P-N junction

965
00:38:16.812 --> 00:38:19.115
or a standard rectifying diode

966
00:38:19.115 --> 00:38:22.818
that allows electricity to go only in one direction.

967
00:38:22.818 --> 00:38:26.522
And so when you're aware of that potential,

968
00:38:26.522 --> 00:38:28.224
that zero point energy is manifesting

969
00:38:28.224 --> 00:38:30.526
itself also right at the junction,

970
00:38:31.486 --> 00:38:33.330
then to me there's the great potential

971
00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:36.499
for allowing electrons to go in one direction.

972
00:38:36.499 --> 00:38:39.936
Powered solely by the quantum fluctuations.

973
00:38:39.936 --> 00:38:41.137
<v Voiceover>Interesting, yes.</v>

974
00:38:41.137 --> 00:38:43.574
And do you think this is something that is

975
00:38:43.574 --> 00:38:46.776
for in an applied sense is going to again

976
00:38:46.776 --> 00:38:48.978
be practically available?

977
00:38:48.978 --> 00:38:49.978
<v ->I absolutely do.</v>

978
00:38:49.978 --> 00:38:51.848
I see no reason that it can't be.

979
00:38:51.848 --> 00:38:54.050
And the fact is all the experiments have been done

980
00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:55.817
to prove it's real.

981
00:38:55.817 --> 00:39:00.223
Only they've been done in microscopic circuit confluence.

982
00:39:00.223 --> 00:39:02.991
So the visionary approach is, for example,

983
00:39:02.991 --> 00:39:06.797
there's Charles Brown patent that actually

984
00:39:06.797 --> 00:39:11.797
is I would say a template for providing this type of power.

985
00:39:12.901 --> 00:39:14.970
He's one of the first to actually recommend

986
00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:16.405
using diodes.

987
00:39:16.405 --> 00:39:18.742
He says to use metal to metal diodes.

988
00:39:18.742 --> 00:39:21.844
Whether or not that particular style is useful,

989
00:39:21.844 --> 00:39:25.048
only time will tell, but my preference is to go

990
00:39:25.048 --> 00:39:26.782
with zero bias diodes.

991
00:39:26.782 --> 00:39:30.387
Zero bias diodes don't require any voltage at all

992
00:39:30.387 --> 00:39:32.254
to jump over the gap.

993
00:39:32.254 --> 00:39:33.723
Jump over that junction.

994
00:39:33.723 --> 00:39:35.892
And when they do they can't get back.

995
00:39:35.892 --> 00:39:37.492
And that's exactly what we want.

996
00:39:37.492 --> 00:39:39.095
Something that's easy to go into the trap

997
00:39:39.095 --> 00:39:40.596
but you can't get out of it.

998
00:39:40.596 --> 00:39:42.298
And the electrons then have to keep flowing

999
00:39:42.298 --> 00:39:44.200
in the one direction that it started to.

1000
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.667
And of course you can charge a battery,

1001
00:39:45.667 --> 00:39:47.036
you can power an appliance.

1002
00:39:47.036 --> 00:39:49.238
But the funny things is you need lots

1003
00:39:49.238 --> 00:39:51.741
of these microscopic array.

1004
00:39:51.741 --> 00:39:54.111
In other words an array of diodes on sheet,

1005
00:39:54.111 --> 00:39:55.345
and then several sheets of them

1006
00:39:55.345 --> 00:39:58.113
so you get say a cubic meter of diodes.

1007
00:39:58.113 --> 00:40:00.716
And this technology's already available

1008
00:40:00.716 --> 00:40:02.418
in our flat screen TV's.

1009
00:40:02.418 --> 00:40:04.654
We've been using diodes all the time now

1010
00:40:04.654 --> 00:40:07.624
to substitute for the cathode ray tubes.

1011
00:40:07.624 --> 00:40:09.925
So we made the transition for our amusement,

1012
00:40:09.925 --> 00:40:12.863
but we haven't made it for our energy source.

1013
00:40:12.863 --> 00:40:14.263
<v Voiceover>Well let's say this is the</v>

1014
00:40:14.263 --> 00:40:16.799
prevailing energy source for our electric needs.

1015
00:40:16.799 --> 00:40:20.769
For example, going back to the archetypes.

1016
00:40:20.769 --> 00:40:23.240
What are the archetypal implications

1017
00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.042
of having this prevail as our energy source?

1018
00:40:26.042 --> 00:40:27.443
Over what's currently happening.

1019
00:40:27.443 --> 00:40:30.013
What does this look like in our world?

1020
00:40:30.013 --> 00:40:32.648
<v ->Well, the archetype for that is hyperion</v>

1021
00:40:32.648 --> 00:40:35.418
and it's the source of the sun's energy

1022
00:40:35.418 --> 00:40:36.685
and the moon's energy.

1023
00:40:36.685 --> 00:40:39.245
So you really get a fundamental

1024
00:40:41.165 --> 00:40:44.026
non-corporeal energy source

1025
00:40:44.026 --> 00:40:46.563
that then manifests as visible

1026
00:40:46.563 --> 00:40:49.365
sun and light energies.

1027
00:40:49.365 --> 00:40:51.801
And this is probably the most futuristic

1028
00:40:51.801 --> 00:40:53.603
and also the most acceptable

1029
00:40:53.603 --> 00:40:56.005
energy source that we can imagine.

1030
00:40:56.005 --> 00:40:57.907
Zero point energy not only

1031
00:40:59.027 --> 00:41:03.712
has been the subject of psychic discoveries for example.

1032
00:41:03.712 --> 00:41:06.749
Where they've done a 20 50 project.

1033
00:41:07.749 --> 00:41:10.086
And I'll think of the PhD's name who did

1034
00:41:10.086 --> 00:41:11.887
the project with thousands of people.

1035
00:41:11.887 --> 00:41:13.856
And they were asking questions about

1036
00:41:13.856 --> 00:41:15.724
what the year 2050 would be like

1037
00:41:15.724 --> 00:41:18.061
in terms of many things including energy.

1038
00:41:18.061 --> 00:41:20.746
But the energy question was universally

1039
00:41:21.764 --> 00:41:23.598
the majority of them described it as

1040
00:41:23.598 --> 00:41:26.369
being solved with small cubic

1041
00:41:26.369 --> 00:41:29.540
type of generators in the home, and in the vehicles,

1042
00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:32.242
and in the businesses, and aircraft.

1043
00:41:32.242 --> 00:41:35.311
And this is exactly the type of archetype

1044
00:41:35.311 --> 00:41:38.940
that the zero point energy generator will portray.

1045
00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:41.950
And the nice things is they under

1046
00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:46.355
this questioning, semi hypnotic type of

1047
00:41:47.325 --> 00:41:49.393
remote viewing of the future were

1048
00:41:49.393 --> 00:41:51.895
describing exactly this type of thing as being,

1049
00:41:51.895 --> 00:41:54.530
"Oh the energy problem has been solved."

1050
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:57.000
And that's exactly the phrase

1051
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.401
and I would say the affirmation

1052
00:41:58.401 --> 00:42:01.229
that I'm constantly repeating to myself.

1053
00:42:01.229 --> 00:42:05.974
I'm trying to envision and create that panacea.

1054
00:42:05.974 --> 00:42:07.776
Where the energy problem has been solved.

1055
00:42:07.776 --> 00:42:09.245
Because our human race I don't believe

1056
00:42:09.245 --> 00:42:11.447
will survive if we can't solve it.

1057
00:42:11.447 --> 00:42:12.482
It's just that crucial.

1058
00:42:12.482 --> 00:42:13.615
<v Voiceover>Yes, everything indicates</v>

1059
00:42:13.615 --> 00:42:14.783
that what you say is true.

1060
00:42:14.783 --> 00:42:16.853
<v ->Studies of societies have shown they collapse</v>

1061
00:42:16.853 --> 00:42:20.423
if they can't completely exponentially increase

1062
00:42:20.423 --> 00:42:22.958
their energy sources every 10 years or so.

1063
00:42:22.958 --> 00:42:25.060
<v Voiceover>Yes, and interesting you were talking</v>

1064
00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:29.132
about some of the more as you say,

1065
00:42:29.132 --> 00:42:31.267
mystical views of it.

1066
00:42:31.267 --> 00:42:34.703
But also, I happen to open your book

1067
00:42:34.703 --> 00:42:36.605
and the first thing that drew my attention.

1068
00:42:36.605 --> 00:42:37.840
I just opened it right in the middle

1069
00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:40.243
this morning and I saw Claude Swanson

1070
00:42:40.243 --> 00:42:42.312
talking about the fact that backgrounds

1071
00:42:42.312 --> 00:42:44.613
are where energy can be strongly effected

1072
00:42:44.613 --> 00:42:46.248
by the mind.

1073
00:42:46.248 --> 00:42:48.834
What are the implications of that?

1074
00:42:49.785 --> 00:42:51.321
<v ->Well, you're getting me into an area</v>

1075
00:42:51.321 --> 00:42:53.656
that I unfortunately did open the door for.

1076
00:42:53.656 --> 00:42:55.224
So I guess I'm ready for it.

1077
00:42:55.224 --> 00:42:56.926
<v Voiceover>It's an area that we love.</v>

1078
00:42:56.926 --> 00:42:57.894
<v ->That's great.</v>

1079
00:42:57.894 --> 00:43:01.664
Well as Steven Greer very graciously

1080
00:43:01.664 --> 00:43:03.700
says to his audiences,

1081
00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.735
"Prayer and affirmation are very important.

1082
00:43:05.735 --> 00:43:07.370
"The more we pray for what we want,

1083
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:09.104
"the more likely it is we'll get it."

1084
00:43:09.104 --> 00:43:10.422
And of course,

1085
00:43:11.973 --> 00:43:13.359
I think it's the

1086
00:43:14.777 --> 00:43:16.111
coast to coast program,

1087
00:43:16.111 --> 00:43:17.980
that's proven when you get a million reviewers

1088
00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:19.250
that all of a sudden you can get them

1089
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:20.884
to start affirming and praying

1090
00:43:20.884 --> 00:43:23.418
and something magical will happen.

1091
00:43:23.418 --> 00:43:25.337
You gotta quantum...

1092
00:43:26.756 --> 00:43:28.924
Even as Sheldrick has pointed out

1093
00:43:28.924 --> 00:43:31.995
there's a certain critical mass

1094
00:43:31.995 --> 00:43:34.697
of people that could probably make a difference.

1095
00:43:34.697 --> 00:43:37.133
So perhaps that's the way that mind

1096
00:43:37.133 --> 00:43:41.504
and matter can actually be functioning in this field.

1097
00:43:41.504 --> 00:43:44.839
No matter what your religious and political views are,

1098
00:43:44.839 --> 00:43:48.510
the survival views tend to be very universal.

1099
00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:50.747
And I found three different studies,

1100
00:43:50.747 --> 00:43:52.581
Fox News, CNN, and another one

1101
00:43:52.581 --> 00:43:54.617
found that 90%, they all came up with

1102
00:43:54.617 --> 00:43:57.152
the same 90% figure of the population

1103
00:43:57.152 --> 00:43:59.421
in the United States believes in God.

1104
00:43:59.421 --> 00:44:01.057
So this is very gratifying

1105
00:44:01.057 --> 00:44:03.093
that we agree on at least one thing.

1106
00:44:03.093 --> 00:44:04.660
And the Supreme Court even affirmed it.

1107
00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:06.195
Said "No, we're gonna keep this affirmation

1108
00:44:06.195 --> 00:44:08.799
"for the country, in God we trust."

1109
00:44:08.799 --> 00:44:13.203
So it's nice to be able to at least reflect upon that

1110
00:44:13.203 --> 00:44:15.604
as perhaps now we're finally developing

1111
00:44:15.604 --> 00:44:18.341
a culture similar to some of the older cultures

1112
00:44:18.341 --> 00:44:22.210
of the far east where this belief in a higher power

1113
00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:25.481
is ingrained in our political system.

1114
00:44:25.481 --> 00:44:26.682
<v Voiceover>And in this way it's a matter</v>

1115
00:44:26.682 --> 00:44:29.485
of extending our interpretation of a higher power.

1116
00:44:29.485 --> 00:44:30.452
<v ->Exactly.</v>

1117
00:44:30.452 --> 00:44:33.757
And of course that's where the questions may arise.

1118
00:44:33.757 --> 00:44:36.158
What type of application can we use?

1119
00:44:36.158 --> 00:44:39.628
I've been involved with the U.S. Psychotronics Association

1120
00:44:39.628 --> 00:44:42.632
for years and I've constantly seen very effective

1121
00:44:42.632 --> 00:44:44.766
radionics practitioners who can do

1122
00:44:44.766 --> 00:44:47.037
what I call miraculous things.

1123
00:44:47.037 --> 00:44:50.105
Cause trees to bloom in two different ways,

1124
00:44:50.105 --> 00:44:53.008
two different fruits, effect weather systems.

1125
00:44:53.008 --> 00:44:55.911
I mean heal people at a distance.

1126
00:44:55.911 --> 00:44:58.147
The feats they've been able to achieve

1127
00:44:58.147 --> 00:45:00.649
through radionics is spectacular.

1128
00:45:00.649 --> 00:45:02.651
But when I ask them about doing something

1129
00:45:02.651 --> 00:45:05.554
what would you say, a more universal level,

1130
00:45:06.724 --> 00:45:09.725
even politically oriented for example.

1131
00:45:09.725 --> 00:45:12.728
Influencing peoples decision one way or another.

1132
00:45:12.728 --> 00:45:16.198
They shy away from having that type of influence.

1133
00:45:16.198 --> 00:45:19.268
And so I feel that perhaps it does take

1134
00:45:19.268 --> 00:45:21.737
more people to agree upon a particular goal.

1135
00:45:21.737 --> 00:45:23.974
And for example, free energy is probably a great

1136
00:45:23.974 --> 00:45:25.374
one to concentrate on.

1137
00:45:25.374 --> 00:45:26.809
<v Voiceover>The health of our sustainability</v>

1138
00:45:26.809 --> 00:45:28.877
of our planet and all those species upon it

1139
00:45:28.877 --> 00:45:31.380
would be a great unifying goal.

1140
00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.049
I mean who could object to that?

1141
00:45:33.049 --> 00:45:34.783
<v ->And that's where the energy sources,</v>

1142
00:45:34.783 --> 00:45:36.019
I feel come in.

1143
00:45:36.019 --> 00:45:38.087
Because as we try to provide the solar

1144
00:45:38.087 --> 00:45:40.789
and the other insulations just to give them

1145
00:45:40.789 --> 00:45:43.258
a few lights and a few computers.

1146
00:45:43.258 --> 00:45:45.894
If you give them a sustaining energy source

1147
00:45:45.894 --> 00:45:48.297
it'll last more than just a decade or two.

1148
00:45:49.197 --> 00:45:50.232
Perhaps then the rest of the planet

1149
00:45:50.232 --> 00:45:52.768
can actually be habited as well.

1150
00:45:52.768 --> 00:45:54.203
<v Voiceover>And let's look at something,</v>

1151
00:45:54.203 --> 00:45:56.739
and also exotic that's something you've

1152
00:45:56.739 --> 00:45:58.208
been interested in and working on

1153
00:45:58.208 --> 00:46:00.575
and now we're going into another area.

1154
00:46:00.575 --> 00:46:01.810
We're talking about healing.

1155
00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:03.980
I just wanna bring this up, touch on it a little bit

1156
00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:05.647
before we wrap up and that is the notion

1157
00:46:05.647 --> 00:46:07.116
of electric clothes.

1158
00:46:07.116 --> 00:46:09.652
You just dropped that little one on me

1159
00:46:09.652 --> 00:46:10.919
just before the interview,

1160
00:46:10.919 --> 00:46:12.988
and I'd like to know more about that.

1161
00:46:12.988 --> 00:46:15.625
<v ->Well my book "Bioelectricmagnetic Healing"</v>

1162
00:46:15.625 --> 00:46:20.028
reviews the basic history and the basic technologies

1163
00:46:20.028 --> 00:46:22.198
of high voltage electrotherapy.

1164
00:46:22.198 --> 00:46:24.700
And this is another art and medicine

1165
00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:27.035
that's actually been lost in the past century.

1166
00:46:27.035 --> 00:46:29.639
And it's unfortunate that we went through

1167
00:46:29.639 --> 00:46:33.676
a 100 year imposition of pharmaceuticals

1168
00:46:33.676 --> 00:46:35.177
on our lifestyle as being the

1169
00:46:35.177 --> 00:46:37.314
only solution to health problems.

1170
00:46:37.314 --> 00:46:40.116
And what's very fascinating to me,

1171
00:46:40.116 --> 00:46:42.551
and this is sort of a growing scientific endeavor,

1172
00:46:42.551 --> 00:46:47.205
is that as we look at how the body uses electricity,

1173
00:46:47.923 --> 00:46:49.325
one thing I point out in my lectures on it

1174
00:46:49.325 --> 00:46:53.629
is that the body tends to store energy in two ways.

1175
00:46:53.629 --> 00:46:56.398
There's only two fundamental ways the body stores energy.

1176
00:46:56.398 --> 00:46:58.401
And one is by chemical gradients.

1177
00:46:58.401 --> 00:47:00.636
And the other is by electrical gradients.

1178
00:47:00.636 --> 00:47:03.538
And the electrical gradient to me is very amazing.

1179
00:47:03.538 --> 00:47:06.775
Because every cell membrane has the

1180
00:47:06.775 --> 00:47:10.145
extraordinary insulation that allows it

1181
00:47:10.145 --> 00:47:14.283
to maintain a voltage gradient

1182
00:47:14.283 --> 00:47:16.585
of 10,000,000 per meter

1183
00:47:16.585 --> 00:47:18.753
or 100,000 volts per centimeter.

1184
00:47:18.753 --> 00:47:20.455
And of course the cell membrane's smaller

1185
00:47:20.455 --> 00:47:22.492
but that gradient is still exactly that.

1186
00:47:22.492 --> 00:47:26.262
And to me that's the electrical energy

1187
00:47:26.262 --> 00:47:29.832
that's ready to be used in a number of ways

1188
00:47:29.832 --> 00:47:31.969
that we're not even familiar with.

1189
00:47:31.969 --> 00:47:33.870
Immune system for example uses it.

1190
00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:37.807
So as someone suffers through immune system challenge,

1191
00:47:37.807 --> 00:47:38.907
a health challenge,

1192
00:47:38.907 --> 00:47:41.843
that gradient, the voltage would actually go down.

1193
00:47:41.843 --> 00:47:44.579
Cell potential across the cell membrane.

1194
00:47:44.579 --> 00:47:46.564
And this is every cell membrane in the body.

1195
00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:48.785
So how can we reverse that for someone

1196
00:47:48.785 --> 00:47:50.753
that's undergoing that problem?

1197
00:47:50.753 --> 00:47:53.990
Well, sitting next to a high voltage generator,

1198
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:56.525
like a Tesla coil can actually be the

1199
00:47:56.525 --> 00:47:59.227
easiest way to induce a high voltage

1200
00:47:59.227 --> 00:48:01.063
potential throughout your body.

1201
00:48:01.063 --> 00:48:02.464
In other words Tesla was the one

1202
00:48:02.464 --> 00:48:03.500
that perceived it first.

1203
00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:05.801
He said the body cells, the fatty tissues

1204
00:48:05.801 --> 00:48:07.803
act as if they're condensars.

1205
00:48:07.803 --> 00:48:10.906
And condensars is just another word for capacitors.

1206
00:48:10.906 --> 00:48:13.041
So he found he liked sitting next to

1207
00:48:13.041 --> 00:48:15.077
a high voltage Tesla coil that he invented.

1208
00:48:15.077 --> 00:48:16.278
(both laugh)

1209
00:48:16.278 --> 00:48:17.513
And it was good for his health.

1210
00:48:17.513 --> 00:48:18.980
But he didn't quite know why,

1211
00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:20.884
but he just knew that he could absorb it

1212
00:48:20.884 --> 00:48:22.651
and even be connected to it.

1213
00:48:22.651 --> 00:48:24.687
And there's pictures of him holding

1214
00:48:24.687 --> 00:48:26.522
light bulbs that lit up in his hand.

1215
00:48:27.522 --> 00:48:28.858
<v Voiceover>I've seen a live demonstration of that,</v>

1216
00:48:28.858 --> 00:48:30.025
it's really quite fascinating.

1217
00:48:30.025 --> 00:48:31.361
<v ->I've done it myself.</v>

1218
00:48:31.361 --> 00:48:33.795
In fact I invented an energy chair

1219
00:48:33.795 --> 00:48:35.831
which I first started to call an electric chair

1220
00:48:35.831 --> 00:48:37.298
but I didn't get a lot of good

1221
00:48:37.298 --> 00:48:39.014
reactions from people.
<v Voiceover>Changed the name.</v>

1222
00:48:39.014 --> 00:48:41.036
<v Thomas>I was forced to change the name.</v>

1223
00:48:41.036 --> 00:48:41.938
Too bad.

1224
00:48:41.938 --> 00:48:44.673
But the point is getting electricity into the body

1225
00:48:44.673 --> 00:48:46.975
is very healthful if you know how to do it.

1226
00:48:46.975 --> 00:48:48.577
And we've discovered the ways

1227
00:48:48.577 --> 00:48:50.979
that are 100 years old technology.

1228
00:48:50.979 --> 00:48:52.515
High voltage a low current,

1229
00:48:52.515 --> 00:48:54.950
the body has tremendous insulation to that

1230
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:58.188
as long as the circuit's designed properly.

1231
00:48:58.188 --> 00:49:01.256
So whether you're contacting it or not contacting it

1232
00:49:01.256 --> 00:49:03.693
you can still benefit from the electron flow.

1233
00:49:03.693 --> 00:49:05.962
Which leads me to the final conclusion

1234
00:49:05.962 --> 00:49:07.929
and that is why would you wanna do that.

1235
00:49:07.929 --> 00:49:10.199
Well electrons behave as if they're

1236
00:49:10.199 --> 00:49:13.668
exactly what vitamin C, and vitamin A,

1237
00:49:13.668 --> 00:49:15.904
and Sodium, and Zinc oftentimes give us

1238
00:49:15.904 --> 00:49:17.372
and that is antioxidants.

1239
00:49:18.302 --> 00:49:20.843
Electrons fulfill what the free radicals want.

1240
00:49:20.843 --> 00:49:22.710
And as soon as a free radical gets an electron

1241
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:24.847
it stops doing the chain reaction.

1242
00:49:24.847 --> 00:49:26.449
People don't know that for example,

1243
00:49:26.449 --> 00:49:28.751
I open my organic chemistry textbook

1244
00:49:28.751 --> 00:49:30.220
and right in there is a description

1245
00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:33.722
of how chlorine molecule will disassociate

1246
00:49:33.722 --> 00:49:36.558
in just body temperatures.

1247
00:49:36.558 --> 00:49:39.294
So when you're showering under chlorinated water,

1248
00:49:39.294 --> 00:49:41.897
you're literally taking not only a chlorine bath,

1249
00:49:41.897 --> 00:49:44.199
but you're allowing that disassociation to happen

1250
00:49:44.199 --> 00:49:46.435
and what a single chlorine atom

1251
00:49:46.435 --> 00:49:49.838
which is an ion does is it replicates

1252
00:49:49.838 --> 00:49:53.241
it's ionic free radical damage 10,000 times.

1253
00:49:53.241 --> 00:49:54.477
<v Voiceover>Oh amazing.</v>

1254
00:49:54.477 --> 00:49:56.511
<v ->On the average 10,000 times.</v>

1255
00:49:56.511 --> 00:49:59.347
So we're getting aging happening every time

1256
00:49:59.347 --> 00:50:01.550
we shower without a shower filter.

1257
00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:05.054
So I advise everyone to get a charcoal shower filter

1258
00:50:05.054 --> 00:50:06.955
from any source and use it.

1259
00:50:06.955 --> 00:50:08.758
Just to be able to live a little bit longer

1260
00:50:08.758 --> 00:50:10.025
and stay a little bit healthier.

1261
00:50:10.025 --> 00:50:12.261
But free radicals are all pervading.

1262
00:50:12.261 --> 00:50:13.896
And we're constantly fighting the battle

1263
00:50:13.896 --> 00:50:16.365
of them internally and a health challenge

1264
00:50:16.365 --> 00:50:18.500
will add more free radical problems.

1265
00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.468
So my design for this,

1266
00:50:20.468 --> 00:50:22.404
and there's many different ways to do it

1267
00:50:22.404 --> 00:50:25.707
is to provide clothes are electrified

1268
00:50:25.707 --> 00:50:27.775
and provide a little trickle current

1269
00:50:27.775 --> 00:50:29.845
along the body surface.

1270
00:50:29.845 --> 00:50:32.781
And so we have the Institute for Frontier Sciences

1271
00:50:32.781 --> 00:50:35.050
Dr. Beverly Rubik actually doing

1272
00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:38.020
measurements right now on the body's meridians.

1273
00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:40.190
'Cause my design I would like to do

1274
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:42.191
is to, my wife and I actually

1275
00:50:42.191 --> 00:50:44.159
are co-inventing this.

1276
00:50:44.159 --> 00:50:46.594
Is to design it so it's compatible

1277
00:50:46.594 --> 00:50:50.099
with the body's surface skin circuitry.

1278
00:50:50.099 --> 00:50:52.967
And if you're familiar with the "Body Electric" book

1279
00:50:52.967 --> 00:50:55.570
by Robert Becker, he's one of the first

1280
00:50:55.570 --> 00:50:59.307
to describe this meridian system circuitry that he measured.

1281
00:50:59.307 --> 00:51:00.742
<v Voiceover>Which has been used for thousands of years</v>

1282
00:51:00.742 --> 00:51:03.979
in ancient technologies, and in acupuncture,

1283
00:51:03.979 --> 00:51:06.281
and so forth, acupressure and beyond.

1284
00:51:06.281 --> 00:51:08.384
<v ->But from an electrical point of view,</v>

1285
00:51:08.384 --> 00:51:10.185
they may not know that the meridians,

1286
00:51:10.185 --> 00:51:13.356
which are just surface lines are about

1287
00:51:13.356 --> 00:51:16.625
10 times lower in resistance then the rest of the skin.

1288
00:51:16.625 --> 00:51:18.293
<v Voiceover>Mmm hmm, very interesting.</v>

1289
00:51:18.293 --> 00:51:19.662
<v ->So it's like we've got a built in circuit</v>

1290
00:51:19.662 --> 00:51:21.530
that's now gonna be the channel,

1291
00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:24.232
and my question is how much can those rivers handle

1292
00:51:24.232 --> 00:51:26.334
in terms of electron flow?

1293
00:51:26.334 --> 00:51:29.104
To distribute the electrons throughout the body.

1294
00:51:29.104 --> 00:51:31.441
<v Voiceover>So you're actively working on that.</v>

1295
00:51:31.441 --> 00:51:33.274
A study's being done right now.

1296
00:51:34.034 --> 00:51:35.644
So what do you think in terms of

1297
00:51:35.644 --> 00:51:38.614
how far out we are on looking forward to that?

1298
00:51:38.614 --> 00:51:40.382
<v ->I would say five years we'll actually</v>

1299
00:51:40.382 --> 00:51:42.050
be able to buy electric clothes.

1300
00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:44.352
There are companies right now that provide

1301
00:51:44.352 --> 00:51:47.422
beautiful sports clothing for any temperature.

1302
00:51:47.422 --> 00:51:50.325
And they're the type of clothes that are already expensive,

1303
00:51:50.325 --> 00:51:52.994
so adding the electric component to them

1304
00:51:52.994 --> 00:51:57.132
will actually be helpful for sports athletes.

1305
00:51:57.132 --> 00:51:59.067
Athletes need to have more performance.

1306
00:51:59.067 --> 00:52:00.868
And if they can attack the free radicals

1307
00:52:00.868 --> 00:52:03.938
that are being formed from their exertion,

1308
00:52:03.938 --> 00:52:06.141
that'll make their performance even better.

1309
00:52:06.141 --> 00:52:09.211
<v Voiceover>What about for the average person like myself?</v>

1310
00:52:09.211 --> 00:52:10.312
Will we be able to--

1311
00:52:10.312 --> 00:52:11.613
<v ->We won't discriminate, I'm sure the company,</v>

1312
00:52:11.613 --> 00:52:13.815
whoever wants to buy them will be fine.

1313
00:52:13.815 --> 00:52:14.886
<v Voiceover>They may not be able</v>

1314
00:52:14.886 --> 00:52:16.118
to pay a fortune for them.

1315
00:52:16.118 --> 00:52:19.020
<v ->Yeah but you're pointing out a very good aspect</v>

1316
00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:22.224
and that is to design the clothes simply as well

1317
00:52:22.224 --> 00:52:24.792
so that the average person can also purchase them.

1318
00:52:24.792 --> 00:52:27.463
<v Voiceover>Well all of this is exciting.</v>

1319
00:52:27.463 --> 00:52:29.865
And we do have places we can begin

1320
00:52:29.865 --> 00:52:30.834
and make changes now.

1321
00:52:30.834 --> 00:52:32.400
And if you can't go buy a hybrid car

1322
00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:34.102
because they're a little pricey too,

1323
00:52:34.102 --> 00:52:35.637
then there are other things we can do

1324
00:52:35.637 --> 00:52:37.740
to simply be more conscious about the

1325
00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:39.708
amount of time we spend in our cars.

1326
00:52:39.708 --> 00:52:42.111
Perhaps even getting back to some old fashion

1327
00:52:42.111 --> 00:52:43.945
technologies if we're urbanites.

1328
00:52:43.945 --> 00:52:46.848
Using bicycles and other means of transportations.

1329
00:52:46.848 --> 00:52:49.051
There are things we can do to stop

1330
00:52:49.051 --> 00:52:51.387
the flooding of the CO2 into the environment.

1331
00:52:51.387 --> 00:52:52.554
<v ->And even recycling.</v>

1332
00:52:52.554 --> 00:52:53.855
I mean there are plenty of non-profits

1333
00:52:53.855 --> 00:52:55.591
that have pointed out that a general

1334
00:52:55.591 --> 00:52:59.362
consciouness of our system will also reduce carbon dioxide.

1335
00:52:59.362 --> 00:53:01.250
Like for example,

1336
00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:06.202
there's a DVD available on stuff.

1337
00:53:06.202 --> 00:53:07.636
And I forgot the exact title

1338
00:53:07.636 --> 00:53:09.972
but it's very interesting how the DVD

1339
00:53:09.972 --> 00:53:12.074
explains every stuff that we buy

1340
00:53:12.074 --> 00:53:14.310
is carbon dioxide being emitted somewhere.

1341
00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:15.744
<v Voiceover>Yes, yes.</v>

1342
00:53:15.744 --> 00:53:19.281
Well, you've given a lot of food for thought,

1343
00:53:19.281 --> 00:53:21.584
and also some nice links here for people

1344
00:53:21.584 --> 00:53:22.650
to check into.

1345
00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:24.119
And of course they can click on yours

1346
00:53:24.119 --> 00:53:26.121
and you have a lot of this on your site right?

1347
00:53:26.121 --> 00:53:26.822
<v ->Yes.</v>

1348
00:53:26.822 --> 00:53:27.957
<v Voiceover>A lot of this available.</v>

1349
00:53:27.957 --> 00:53:29.258
Thank you so much for your time again,

1350
00:53:29.258 --> 00:53:31.626
and I think it really does help that not only

1351
00:53:31.626 --> 00:53:34.763
do you have this incredibly creative

1352
00:53:34.763 --> 00:53:36.898
and technically educated brain,

1353
00:53:36.898 --> 00:53:40.336
but also the more subtle and mystical elements

1354
00:53:40.336 --> 00:53:41.870
of yourself through your own meditation

1355
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:43.906
and so forth that allow you to explain

1356
00:53:43.906 --> 00:53:47.199
this to us in archetypal fashion is really important.

1357
00:53:47.199 --> 00:53:49.645
It's time we start seeing the big picture.

1358
00:53:49.645 --> 00:53:50.979
Beyond just the physical.

1359
00:53:50.979 --> 00:53:52.147
<v ->I'm glad to hear you say that.</v>

1360
00:53:52.147 --> 00:53:52.848
<v Voiceover>Thank you.</v>

1361
00:53:52.848 --> 00:53:53.916
<v ->You're welcome.</v>

1362
00:53:53.916 --> 00:53:55.451
(slow paced music)

1363
00:53:55.451 --> 00:53:57.718
<v ->Please visit Tom's website to subscribe</v>

1364
00:53:57.718 --> 00:53:59.621
to Future Energy magazine.

1365
00:53:59.621 --> 00:54:01.456
And he says you'll also likely enjoy

1366
00:54:01.456 --> 00:54:03.491
a little video called "The Story of Stuff"

1367
00:54:03.491 --> 00:54:04.860
which we have on our site.

1368
00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:06.762
You can find that on Youtube as well.

1369
00:54:06.762 --> 00:54:08.463
In addition to Thomas' magazine

1370
00:54:08.463 --> 00:54:11.234
he's also authored a number of books on alternative energy

1371
00:54:11.234 --> 00:54:14.937
including "Zero Point Energy: The Fuel of the Future."

1372
00:54:14.937 --> 00:54:18.207
You can pick up a copy at Amazon or other book sellers.

1373
00:54:18.207 --> 00:54:20.609
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
