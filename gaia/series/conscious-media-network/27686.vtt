00:00:01.375 --> 00:00:04.020
<v ->Nassim Haramein was brimming with curiosity</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.196
and began asking some of the big questions

3
00:00:06.196 --> 00:00:07.572
at the age of nine,

4
00:00:07.572 --> 00:00:10.057
when he had his first experience of greater knowledge.

5
00:00:10.057 --> 00:00:12.564
He passed into his young adult years

6
00:00:12.564 --> 00:00:14.163
living in a van so he can afford to

7
00:00:14.163 --> 00:00:17.363
study the world of physics and living systems full time.

8
00:00:17.363 --> 00:00:19.763
He was ultimately labeled a brilliant rebel

9
00:00:19.763 --> 00:00:21.011
in the world of physics.

10
00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:22.782
In August of this year he entered

11
00:00:22.782 --> 00:00:24.008
another phase of his life,

12
00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:26.056
as he was acknowledged by his peers

13
00:00:26.056 --> 00:00:27.539
to be one of the most original

14
00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.258
and paradigm shifting physicists of the day,

15
00:00:30.258 --> 00:00:32.573
when he received a prestigious scientific award

16
00:00:32.573 --> 00:00:36.477
for his black hole theory which applies to all of creation.

17
00:00:45.507 --> 00:00:46.471
<v Voiceover>I am very glad,</v>

18
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:48.135
three years I've wanted to meet you.

19
00:00:48.135 --> 00:00:50.789
Finally we get together in this lovely place here

20
00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.205
and you recently just had, I think something that

21
00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:57.690
was very powerful in your own career

22
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.058
by being acknowledged within the physics community.

23
00:01:00.058 --> 00:01:01.850
Cause you were a bit of a rebel and renegade.

24
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.823
You discovered a lot of this on your own

25
00:01:03.823 --> 00:01:05.370
without those books.

26
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.137
<v ->Right.</v>

27
00:01:06.137 --> 00:01:09.156
<v Voiceover>And so now to come into your fullness,</v>

28
00:01:09.156 --> 00:01:11.737
tell us a little bit about what happened recently

29
00:01:11.737 --> 00:01:13.614
when you were honoured with an award over the

30
00:01:13.614 --> 00:01:16.473
Schwarzschild proton paper.

31
00:01:16.473 --> 00:01:19.193
<v ->Yeah, it was great, I just,</v>

32
00:01:19.193 --> 00:01:23.598
it was so unexpected because this is a

33
00:01:23.598 --> 00:01:26.990
physics conference and Yales University had the

34
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.960
maths department and its every two years

35
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.960
and I was, you know, invited to present a paper

36
00:01:38.157 --> 00:01:42.690
there this year and so since it was an invited paper

37
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.615
I was a little bit more pushy,

38
00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:50.561
a little bit more open about the meaning of

39
00:01:50.561 --> 00:01:52.225
what I wanted to say

40
00:01:52.225 --> 00:01:55.361
and a little more radical, you know,

41
00:01:55.361 --> 00:01:58.753
and so I was not, I actually was expecting

42
00:01:58.753 --> 00:02:01.313
a little bit of back slash when I got there,

43
00:02:01.313 --> 00:02:04.075
after you know submitting my paper

44
00:02:04.075 --> 00:02:08.619
and so I was really surprised

45
00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.784
in the middle of the conference,

46
00:02:10.784 --> 00:02:14.283
the Director of the conference took me aside

47
00:02:14.283 --> 00:02:16.650
and I thought "Oh, here we go.",

48
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.831
you know, he might ask me to retract my paper or something

49
00:02:20.831 --> 00:02:24.437
and he told me, "I noticed that you were leaving,

50
00:02:24.437 --> 00:02:26.847
"before the awards ceremony this year,

51
00:02:26.847 --> 00:02:30.378
"this week and I would like you to stay"

52
00:02:30.378 --> 00:02:32.745
and I thought, Why, he said,

53
00:02:32.745 --> 00:02:37.745
" Well, you know, you won the best paper award in physics"

54
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.550
<v Voiceover>You must have almost fainted.</v>

55
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.108
<v ->I almost fainted, it was,</v>

56
00:02:41.108 --> 00:02:43.731
I was in shock, I didn't know what to say

57
00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:46.793
and so he was looking at me like, you know,

58
00:02:46.793 --> 00:02:48.862
"OK, can you stay", you know

59
00:02:48.862 --> 00:02:51.902
and I'm like, Oh yeah I will change my plans,

60
00:02:51.902 --> 00:02:54.685
and it was, it was remarkable,

61
00:02:54.685 --> 00:02:58.002
it tells you how much things are changing

62
00:02:58.002 --> 00:03:00.562
because this is a very radical paper.

63
00:03:00.562 --> 00:03:02.792
<v Voiceover>This is a very hopeful message.</v>

64
00:03:02.792 --> 00:03:06.045
<v ->It is. Its a paper that says that</v>

65
00:03:06.045 --> 00:03:08.594
every atom is a mini black hole,

66
00:03:08.594 --> 00:03:10.311
that it has infinite density,

67
00:03:10.311 --> 00:03:12.338
that it has infinite potential,

68
00:03:12.338 --> 00:03:15.633
that everything has singularity at its centre

69
00:03:15.633 --> 00:03:19.420
and the paper, in its first few pages,

70
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.420
elaborates and shows mathematically that

71
00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:31.440
the vacuum energy, the structure of the vacuum itself,

72
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.440
interlinked or entangles all protons,

73
00:03:36.571 --> 00:03:39.099
the proton being the nuclei of an atom,

74
00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.354
that all the nuclei of an atom are entangled

75
00:03:43.354 --> 00:03:45.488
because of the structure of the vacuum

76
00:03:45.488 --> 00:03:48.783
that the structure, that the vacuum is not a

77
00:03:48.783 --> 00:03:51.034
passive vacuum but a active vacuum

78
00:03:51.034 --> 00:03:54.287
that has a role to play in the creation of the,

79
00:03:54.287 --> 00:03:58.980
our material world but as well is the structure

80
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.884
that connects all things, so actually this is a

81
00:04:02.884 --> 00:04:06.734
mathematical rendering of the concept,

82
00:04:06.734 --> 00:04:10.723
everything is one, so that it actually is

83
00:04:10.723 --> 00:04:13.006
mathematically proven.

84
00:04:13.006 --> 00:04:15.694
<v Voiceover>This is huge that</v>

85
00:04:15.694 --> 00:04:17.464
you would be honoured in this way

86
00:04:17.464 --> 00:04:20.995
because this really has turned a lot of other peoples

87
00:04:20.995 --> 00:04:23.053
papers that were submitted upside down.

88
00:04:23.053 --> 00:04:25.026
Why do you think this happened

89
00:04:25.026 --> 00:04:25.615
and why do you think now?

90
00:04:25.615 --> 00:04:27.589
Well especially considering, your project

91
00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:28.890
is called the resonance project,

92
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.298
thats a big word right there.

93
00:04:30.298 --> 00:04:31.162
<v ->Yeah</v>

94
00:04:31.162 --> 00:04:32.900
<v Voiceover>Why do you think this happened now?</v>

95
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.569
<v ->Oh I think that the world of physics</v>

96
00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:38.852
and the world in general is transforming

97
00:04:38.852 --> 00:04:41.124
and there is an opening that is occuring

98
00:04:41.124 --> 00:04:43.950
and certainly in physics, you know,

99
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.678
there is a level of arrogance thats

100
00:04:45.678 --> 00:04:48.323
slowly fading away, you know,

101
00:04:48.323 --> 00:04:52.803
not so long ago, when I started bringing my work

102
00:04:52.803 --> 00:04:56.654
to the physics community, some 15 to 20 years ago,

103
00:04:56.654 --> 00:05:00.088
the tendency was to think "We've got the universe

104
00:05:00.088 --> 00:05:04.226
"pretty well all figured and all we need is a few

105
00:05:04.226 --> 00:05:07.757
"little things to work out and then we have it"

106
00:05:07.757 --> 00:05:08.887
<v Voiceover>They just have to</v>

107
00:05:08.887 --> 00:05:09.773
connect a couple of little dots.

108
00:05:09.773 --> 00:05:12.354
<v ->Right and so there was a lot of, you know,</v>

109
00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:14.306
arrogance in the way, you know,

110
00:05:14.306 --> 00:05:16.898
physicists who are interacting with new ideas

111
00:05:16.898 --> 00:05:20.385
and so on and so it was extremely difficult to be heard.

112
00:05:20.385 --> 00:05:24.844
But since then a lot of failures in our theories

113
00:05:24.844 --> 00:05:28.865
have come forward, a lot of experiments in laboratory

114
00:05:28.865 --> 00:05:33.153
and data from cosmological instruments

115
00:05:33.153 --> 00:05:36.154
and so on have shown us that there is

116
00:05:36.154 --> 00:05:40.197
anomalies that we cannot explain with the standard model

117
00:05:40.197 --> 00:05:42.234
and all sorts of things are coming up

118
00:05:42.234 --> 00:05:46.906
and so, you know, certain level of failure of string theory

119
00:05:46.906 --> 00:05:51.906
and so on and I think that its changed the world of physics

120
00:05:52.868 --> 00:05:57.166
and that physicists and scientists in general

121
00:05:57.166 --> 00:06:00.959
are returning to that, you know,

122
00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:04.862
level of awe and that you know that

123
00:06:04.862 --> 00:06:06.142
<v Voiceover>More of an open inquiry</v>

124
00:06:06.142 --> 00:06:07.902
that had been lost and corrupted.

125
00:06:07.902 --> 00:06:08.926
<v ->Exactly</v>

126
00:06:08.926 --> 00:06:10.089
<v Voiceover>Thats fabulous.</v>

127
00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:13.875
<v ->Yeah and so they are much more willing</v>

128
00:06:13.875 --> 00:06:16.499
to look at new ideas and new theories

129
00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:19.326
and I think this paper was so classical,

130
00:06:19.326 --> 00:06:22.877
you know, its a peer review of some 10 or 11,

131
00:06:22.877 --> 00:06:26.130
peer review is on the panel that looked at it

132
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.842
and I think that it was so classical,

133
00:06:29.842 --> 00:06:32.701
its like 14 equation and eight pages

134
00:06:32.701 --> 00:06:35.005
and it gets rid of the strong force

135
00:06:35.005 --> 00:06:38.556
and many concepts of quantum theory

136
00:06:38.556 --> 00:06:41.596
and it solves the atomic structure

137
00:06:41.596 --> 00:06:45.639
in a classical way, its so beautiful mathematically

138
00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:48.934
that I think it took them, you know,

139
00:06:48.934 --> 00:06:52.209
on a magic carpet ride and they thought

140
00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:53.851
they had to give the award to it.

141
00:06:53.851 --> 00:06:55.291
I was very very honoured.

142
00:06:55.291 --> 00:06:57.915
<v Voiceover>Well, on behalf of everybody else</v>

143
00:06:57.915 --> 00:07:02.310
on the planet, I'm thrilled that this kind of humility

144
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.256
is starting to come back because this is a time for inquiry

145
00:07:06.256 --> 00:07:08.709
and that for you to be honoured is really kind of

146
00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:12.080
the penultimate in that, in that understanding, you know.

147
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.565
<v ->Yeah, I'm really excited and I think its a,</v>

148
00:07:14.565 --> 00:07:19.002
it helps to get other physicists to look at it,

149
00:07:19.002 --> 00:07:23.087
to get some credibility in the physics I'm writing

150
00:07:23.087 --> 00:07:25.593
and to make people aware that

151
00:07:25.593 --> 00:07:29.977
we are not living in a finite world that, you know,

152
00:07:29.977 --> 00:07:34.947
the atomic structure itself has this infinite potential

153
00:07:34.947 --> 00:07:37.945
within it that, you know, when people are talking

154
00:07:37.945 --> 00:07:40.782
philosophically or spiritually about their

155
00:07:40.782 --> 00:07:42.776
infinite nature and all this stuff,

156
00:07:42.776 --> 00:07:46.488
it doesn't have to be outside the physical world,

157
00:07:46.488 --> 00:07:48.739
that the actual physical world

158
00:07:48.739 --> 00:07:50.883
is what they are talking about,

159
00:07:50.883 --> 00:07:53.986
that, you know, philosophy and sprituality

160
00:07:53.986 --> 00:07:57.911
are not the divorced from the atomic structure,

161
00:07:57.911 --> 00:08:00.930
that the atomic structure is actually a manifestation

162
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:05.930
of this dynamic of creation that, you know,

163
00:08:05.975 --> 00:08:10.124
we might call consciousness, spirituality and so on.

164
00:08:10.124 --> 00:08:12.310
<v Voiceover>And this is interesting because</v>

165
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.049
what your, the implications of these

166
00:08:14.049 --> 00:08:17.675
mathematical formula that you very elegantly put forth

167
00:08:17.675 --> 00:08:20.385
and are now being accepted has very deep

168
00:08:20.385 --> 00:08:23.542
spiritual or consciousness oriented awareness

169
00:08:23.542 --> 00:08:25.334
oriented implications.

170
00:08:25.334 --> 00:08:29.472
<v ->Yeah its not so obvious by reading the paper directly</v>

171
00:08:29.472 --> 00:08:30.208
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

172
00:08:30.208 --> 00:08:32.235
<v ->I do under a statement that all protons are</v>

173
00:08:32.235 --> 00:08:35.018
entangled that I make at the beginning

174
00:08:35.018 --> 00:08:38.410
showing that the amount of energy

175
00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:42.239
available in the vacuum structure inside the proton

176
00:08:42.239 --> 00:08:44.447
equates the mass of the universe

177
00:08:44.447 --> 00:08:48.042
and that all the mass of the universe is present

178
00:08:48.042 --> 00:08:51.337
in each proton in the vacuum energy

179
00:08:51.337 --> 00:08:54.793
showing that the vacuum connects all protons.

180
00:08:54.793 --> 00:08:57.652
I did in that statement, its not so obvious

181
00:08:57.652 --> 00:09:00.254
to see how this relates to consciousness

182
00:09:00.254 --> 00:09:03.689
but if you take all of my papers together

183
00:09:03.689 --> 00:09:07.294
and you understand the theory globally,

184
00:09:07.294 --> 00:09:11.165
you know, holistically, you start to see

185
00:09:11.165 --> 00:09:16.165
how that, you know, it starts to give a meaning

186
00:09:16.211 --> 00:09:18.664
to the word consciousness because people use the word

187
00:09:18.664 --> 00:09:21.032
consciousness all the time, you know like,

188
00:09:21.032 --> 00:09:23.290
"Ah, the universe is all conscious,

189
00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.722
"everything is consciousness",

190
00:09:24.722 --> 00:09:28.231
but then there is not really any definition of consciousness

191
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:31.124
and I think that what this work kind of brings along

192
00:09:31.124 --> 00:09:34.516
as well is that it starts to describe consciousness

193
00:09:34.516 --> 00:09:38.131
as a fundamental dynamics of the forces of nature

194
00:09:38.131 --> 00:09:42.227
and basically this paper I just published eliminates

195
00:09:42.227 --> 00:09:46.707
some of the, two of the forces of quantum world

196
00:09:46.707 --> 00:09:51.581
and so we are left with only two forces in the universe,

197
00:09:51.581 --> 00:09:55.922
two classical forces, gravity and electromagnetism

198
00:09:55.922 --> 00:10:00.922
and one is basically the vacuum energy moving

199
00:10:01.074 --> 00:10:04.978
inwards towards the centre, gravitational pull

200
00:10:04.978 --> 00:10:07.740
and the other one is the electromagnetic feild

201
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.868
or the vacuum structure moving away from centre

202
00:10:11.868 --> 00:10:14.129
and so you have a radiated pulse

203
00:10:14.129 --> 00:10:17.329
and the gravitational pulse and the two are feeding back

204
00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:20.441
on each other and thats how the universe learns about itself

205
00:10:20.441 --> 00:10:24.313
its because there is a fundamental feedback

206
00:10:24.313 --> 00:10:27.609
in the structure of space and consciousness

207
00:10:27.609 --> 00:10:31.694
is just that, its self awareness, its feedback

208
00:10:31.694 --> 00:10:34.627
and so I think it starts to give us a

209
00:10:34.627 --> 00:10:39.627
good foundation to actually have a quantitative

210
00:10:40.248 --> 00:10:45.248
and you know analysis of the structure of consciousness

211
00:10:46.861 --> 00:10:50.040
and how the universe learns about itself,

212
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.677
how itself organises and how, you know,

213
00:10:53.677 --> 00:10:56.674
I mean the amazing, you know,

214
00:10:56.674 --> 00:11:01.272
organisation and coordination that we see in our universe

215
00:11:01.272 --> 00:11:04.546
that cannot be explained by mere, you know,

216
00:11:04.546 --> 00:11:05.943
random function.

217
00:11:05.943 --> 00:11:07.639
<v Voiceover>No and the whole notion of</v>

218
00:11:07.639 --> 00:11:10.839
creating order out of chaos there have to be

219
00:11:10.839 --> 00:11:13.857
certain organising principles that create coherence

220
00:11:13.857 --> 00:11:14.764
<v ->Thats right.</v>

221
00:11:14.764 --> 00:11:16.555
<v Voiceover>And so this is where most people ears</v>

222
00:11:16.555 --> 00:11:19.201
perk up a little bit, its how do you create coherence,

223
00:11:19.201 --> 00:11:21.057
how do you create?

224
00:11:21.057 --> 00:11:24.608
How do we create both collectively

225
00:11:24.608 --> 00:11:28.512
and individually and this what you are talking about has,

226
00:11:28.512 --> 00:11:31.115
it is the basis of the creation process.

227
00:11:31.115 --> 00:11:34.666
<v ->Thats right, you know, its the basis of the understanding</v>

228
00:11:34.666 --> 00:11:37.845
of the dynamics of the creation process

229
00:11:37.845 --> 00:11:42.165
and then the application of that into our life everyday

230
00:11:42.165 --> 00:11:45.162
can have a very very deep meaning.

231
00:11:45.162 --> 00:11:46.484
<v Voiceover>Lets start talking about that</v>

232
00:11:46.484 --> 00:11:49.033
because I think thats where all of us live,

233
00:11:49.033 --> 00:11:50.729
we are seeing the world around us

234
00:11:50.729 --> 00:11:52.745
not just the world of physics changing very rapidly,

235
00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:54.932
a lot of people are being very unseated by it.

236
00:11:54.932 --> 00:11:57.140
Those who are prepared are already becoming

237
00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.625
coherent in their own lives and understanding

238
00:11:59.625 --> 00:12:01.342
of whats coming up and how to deal with it.

239
00:12:01.342 --> 00:12:02.078
<v ->Yeah</v>

240
00:12:02.078 --> 00:12:04.105
<v Voiceover>So lets talk about that,</v>

241
00:12:04.105 --> 00:12:06.430
off camera we were talking about the notion

242
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.888
of focus persistent desire and whatever kind of

243
00:12:10.888 --> 00:12:14.227
plasmic effect that may have, however that goes back into

244
00:12:14.227 --> 00:12:16.573
programming, coalescing, making coherent

245
00:12:16.573 --> 00:12:17.426
<v ->Right.</v>

246
00:12:17.426 --> 00:12:19.122
<v Voiceover>An outcome and the principles</v>

247
00:12:19.122 --> 00:12:20.402
you were talking about and just go for it.

248
00:12:20.402 --> 00:12:22.887
You can even start with synchronicity

249
00:12:22.887 --> 00:12:27.132
as really a kind of a silly little word on one level.

250
00:12:27.132 --> 00:12:30.012
<v ->Right, well you know, I think that synchronicity</v>

251
00:12:30.012 --> 00:12:33.937
is actually evidence of this self organising system

252
00:12:33.937 --> 00:12:37.606
and you know, some people think of it as

253
00:12:37.606 --> 00:12:41.212
some God or God organising creation,

254
00:12:41.212 --> 00:12:43.462
some people think of it, you know,

255
00:12:43.462 --> 00:12:46.683
as you know, spirit and many other things.

256
00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:51.163
What I'm doing, I'm starting to actually pinpoint the

257
00:12:51.163 --> 00:12:54.789
dynamics of that self organising agent

258
00:12:54.789 --> 00:12:59.789
and it turns out that it seems to be the vacuum

259
00:12:59.962 --> 00:13:04.101
itself that, you know the space between you and I,

260
00:13:04.101 --> 00:13:07.610
the space inside the atom is not empty,

261
00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:11.439
its full of all the information that radiated into it

262
00:13:11.439 --> 00:13:15.940
and then its fed back to us as our experience of reality

263
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.729
and so better we become at you know,

264
00:13:20.729 --> 00:13:25.729
focussing our intention in feeding the information to the

265
00:13:25.859 --> 00:13:30.360
vacuum of our intention in a most focussed way

266
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.336
and clear way then easier it is for the vacuum

267
00:13:33.336 --> 00:13:35.960
to feedback an experience that matches

268
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.299
closer and closer what we want

269
00:13:39.299 --> 00:13:42.786
and I think that the level of synchronicity

270
00:13:42.786 --> 00:13:46.477
increases you know and its noticeable

271
00:13:46.477 --> 00:13:49.282
because it becomes easier and easier

272
00:13:49.282 --> 00:13:52.162
for the vacuum to like feedback for the universe

273
00:13:52.162 --> 00:13:55.276
to feedback what we desire.

274
00:13:55.276 --> 00:13:56.972
<v Voiceover>Essentially manifestation</v>

275
00:13:56.972 --> 00:13:57.879
is what we are talking about.

276
00:13:57.879 --> 00:14:00.449
<v ->Manifestation thats right but it is always</v>

277
00:14:00.449 --> 00:14:04.161
a balance between your internal interpretation

278
00:14:04.161 --> 00:14:07.489
and what the universe is feeding you back.

279
00:14:07.489 --> 00:14:09.323
Its always a little bit different

280
00:14:09.323 --> 00:14:13.014
because whenever you feed information to the vacuum,

281
00:14:13.014 --> 00:14:15.424
whenever you feed information to the universe,

282
00:14:15.424 --> 00:14:19.392
then its modified by all the rest of people

283
00:14:19.392 --> 00:14:21.931
that are feeding information to the universe

284
00:14:21.931 --> 00:14:24.949
and its coordinated so that we all live in the same

285
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:27.658
consenhsious reality, you know,

286
00:14:27.658 --> 00:14:29.781
people say, "You create your reality",

287
00:14:29.781 --> 00:14:34.442
well if everybody created their own reality

288
00:14:34.442 --> 00:14:35.839
nobody would meet.

289
00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:36.628
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

290
00:14:36.628 --> 00:14:38.228
<v ->It would be very lonely, you know,</v>

291
00:14:38.228 --> 00:14:40.873
everybody will be in their own reality by themselves

292
00:14:40.873 --> 00:14:41.481
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

293
00:14:41.481 --> 00:14:44.980
<v ->So there is a consensus, there is a relationship,</v>

294
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:49.396
so that you can, you know, focus on what you want

295
00:14:49.396 --> 00:14:52.809
and the universe is going to feed you back,

296
00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:54.483
the vacuum is going to feed you back

297
00:14:54.483 --> 00:14:57.448
something close to what you want

298
00:14:57.448 --> 00:15:02.448
but that is coordinated with everybody else's intention

299
00:15:03.485 --> 00:15:04.605
<v Voiceover>With the collective</v>

300
00:15:04.605 --> 00:15:06.024
<v ->And with the collective, right</v>

301
00:15:06.024 --> 00:15:07.133
<v Voiceover>Yes that makes total sense.</v>

302
00:15:07.133 --> 00:15:09.362
<v ->So theres a relationship, theres a dance</v>

303
00:15:09.362 --> 00:15:13.426
and I think that, you know, even in this paper

304
00:15:13.426 --> 00:15:15.698
that I just published, which is a technical paper,

305
00:15:15.698 --> 00:15:18.930
if you read between the lines you start to realise,

306
00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:23.930
the atoms that are made of, which is billions

307
00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:28.124
and billions of atoms were made out of hundred trillion cell

308
00:15:28.124 --> 00:15:30.118
you know, each cell's made of billions of atoms

309
00:15:30.118 --> 00:15:32.188
and so you can imagine like,

310
00:15:32.188 --> 00:15:36.155
all these little mini black holes, I mean,

311
00:15:36.155 --> 00:15:37.457
this is what this paper say,

312
00:15:37.457 --> 00:15:40.155
that each one of these things are mini black holes,

313
00:15:40.155 --> 00:15:42.640
teeny winne black holes that are spinning

314
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.752
at near the speed of light,

315
00:15:44.752 --> 00:15:46.155
very very close to the speed of light

316
00:15:46.155 --> 00:15:50.261
and that you know, it gives meaning as well

317
00:15:50.261 --> 00:15:53.173
to the concept that we are light, you know,

318
00:15:53.173 --> 00:15:57.909
and that the way into the vacuum,

319
00:15:57.909 --> 00:16:02.730
the way into the capacity to influence deeper

320
00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:07.730
and deeper and more accurately the structure of the vacuum

321
00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:12.809
is to actually go inwards towards that singularity,

322
00:16:12.809 --> 00:16:16.660
inwards towards that point of absolute stillness

323
00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:20.361
were all spins cancels out at the centre of singulrity.

324
00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:22.515
<v Voiceover>Explain that in a practical sense,</v>

325
00:16:22.515 --> 00:16:24.979
in the process of creation for example,

326
00:16:24.979 --> 00:16:27.583
were say you have a focussed desire and now.

327
00:16:27.583 --> 00:16:31.316
<v ->The tendency is to try to focus it outside yourself</v>

328
00:16:31.316 --> 00:16:34.985
but really whats necessary is to, you know,

329
00:16:34.985 --> 00:16:38.654
use techniques of meditation or contemplation or so on

330
00:16:38.654 --> 00:16:43.315
to actually go inside yourself towards the infinitely small,

331
00:16:43.315 --> 00:16:46.174
you know, people say that I have a hard time visualising

332
00:16:46.174 --> 00:16:48.542
infinity, well usually thats because they are trying to

333
00:16:48.542 --> 00:16:51.581
visualise infinitely big but if they contain

334
00:16:51.581 --> 00:16:54.418
the infinitely small then they have access

335
00:16:54.418 --> 00:16:57.906
to the infinite, through the infinitely small

336
00:16:57.906 --> 00:17:00.125
and so to turn the senses inwards

337
00:17:00.125 --> 00:17:04.423
which happens to be what most of the masters

338
00:17:04.423 --> 00:17:07.047
that have walked the earth have been trying to tell us

339
00:17:07.047 --> 00:17:11.047
throughout the ages and to actually go towards singularity,

340
00:17:11.047 --> 00:17:15.388
towards the infinite potential inside each one of the atoms

341
00:17:15.388 --> 00:17:20.388
and then to have like a directed, you know,

342
00:17:20.518 --> 00:17:25.211
information network, you know, to have access to the

343
00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:28.838
information network and direct it in a way that

344
00:17:28.838 --> 00:17:33.008
will fulfil, you know, our deepest desires,

345
00:17:33.008 --> 00:17:36.912
I think becomes very very powerful.

346
00:17:36.912 --> 00:17:41.018
So now we start to see physical route,

347
00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:45.018
a physical way, a mechanical way to actually

348
00:17:45.018 --> 00:17:47.151
have more and more influence on the vacuum

349
00:17:47.151 --> 00:17:50.799
and transform our world to more and more of what we want.

350
00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:52.378
<v Voiceover>So lets say we have gone in</v>

351
00:17:52.378 --> 00:17:55.065
through that process, we are mastering that with our

352
00:17:55.065 --> 00:17:57.721
persistent focussed desire and we are taking it in

353
00:17:57.721 --> 00:18:01.593
to the most infinite level inside our own being,

354
00:18:01.593 --> 00:18:05.422
going inward, lets talk about the process from your model

355
00:18:05.422 --> 00:18:10.422
and you can, for lay people obviously, as to what happens to

356
00:18:10.979 --> 00:18:14.595
create what would almost be perceived as a step down process

357
00:18:14.595 --> 00:18:18.200
through the layers or fields of density to create something

358
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.186
that has now become, you know, our physical reality,

359
00:18:21.186 --> 00:18:22.701
part of our physical reality.

360
00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:26.178
And I know you are talking perceptions as well as

361
00:18:26.178 --> 00:18:29.549
reality so that whole thing, take off on it.

362
00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:32.727
<v ->Well you know I call it vacuum engineering</v>

363
00:18:32.727 --> 00:18:36.471
and its a you know, you could apply it to

364
00:18:36.471 --> 00:18:40.279
literally engineering devices in labratory

365
00:18:40.279 --> 00:18:43.020
or you could apply it to you know,

366
00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.827
an individual becoming more and more aware

367
00:18:46.827 --> 00:18:49.238
of the exchange thats constantly occuring

368
00:18:49.238 --> 00:18:51.883
between them and the vacuum, you know,

369
00:18:51.883 --> 00:18:56.883
an atom is made out of 99.999999% space,

370
00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.661
so when people say, "What are you talking about,

371
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:04.096
"about the vacuum", I'm telling them literally

372
00:19:04.096 --> 00:19:06.997
but I'm talking about them, you know,

373
00:19:06.997 --> 00:19:11.997
because you are 99.9999, so what you experience as yourself

374
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:18.130
is actually 0.00000001 of a percent of whats actually there.

375
00:19:18.473 --> 00:19:19.743
<v Voiceover>Well its a strong illusion,</v>

376
00:19:19.743 --> 00:19:20.905
an holographic illusion.

377
00:19:20.905 --> 00:19:24.340
<v ->That is absolutely and thats what I'm trying</v>

378
00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.942
to get people aware of is that the space

379
00:19:26.942 --> 00:19:31.942
is actually what produces the material world

380
00:19:32.382 --> 00:19:35.048
and so to become aware of that

381
00:19:35.048 --> 00:19:38.504
and to become aware of the exchange thats

382
00:19:38.504 --> 00:19:41.025
constantly occurring between you and

383
00:19:41.025 --> 00:19:43.319
between what you call the material world

384
00:19:43.319 --> 00:19:45.708
that you are made of and the space

385
00:19:45.708 --> 00:19:49.868
and that everything all around you in your environment

386
00:19:49.868 --> 00:19:54.868
you know, biological or not is constantly exchanging

387
00:19:56.664 --> 00:20:00.312
to start to become aware of that world,

388
00:20:00.312 --> 00:20:05.133
starts to put you in a position of being able to alter it.

389
00:20:05.133 --> 00:20:09.410
Be able to modify it and to you know become,

390
00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.426
what I call a vacuum engineering,

391
00:20:11.426 --> 00:20:15.884
start to transform it in a way that can produce the

392
00:20:15.884 --> 00:20:19.767
most positive effect in your life, you know,

393
00:20:19.767 --> 00:20:24.172
including to discover, you know, what some people

394
00:20:24.172 --> 00:20:27.436
may call your darma, you know, your mission,

395
00:20:27.436 --> 00:20:30.081
you know, what you are here to do,

396
00:20:30.081 --> 00:20:32.875
how to do it and so on, I mean,

397
00:20:32.875 --> 00:20:36.352
lots of inspiration, lots of information can come from that

398
00:20:36.352 --> 00:20:38.838
because you are feeding the vacuum but as well

399
00:20:38.838 --> 00:20:40.832
the vacuum is feeding you back,

400
00:20:40.832 --> 00:20:43.221
so if you become more aware of it,

401
00:20:43.221 --> 00:20:46.773
its like all of a sudden the little voice is not so little

402
00:20:46.773 --> 00:20:49.749
anymore, you are hearing clearer and clearer and clearer

403
00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:54.421
you know, the information network thats available to you

404
00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:57.482
that before might have passed you by.

405
00:20:57.482 --> 00:20:58.666
<v Voiceover>And if you weren't so clear,</v>

406
00:20:58.666 --> 00:21:01.332
you might not be magnetising such clear information

407
00:21:01.332 --> 00:21:04.191
back, I mean this clarity is really a key point isn't it?

408
00:21:04.191 --> 00:21:08.116
<v ->Thats right and to get that clarity,</v>

409
00:21:08.116 --> 00:21:11.659
I think that the best tool is to spend a few

410
00:21:11.659 --> 00:21:14.133
minutes everyday going inwards and

411
00:21:14.133 --> 00:21:17.183
like you said, you know, going through the levels of

412
00:21:17.183 --> 00:21:21.844
densities, deeper and deeper towards singularity.

413
00:21:21.844 --> 00:21:25.865
I like to think of it as, even like mechanically,

414
00:21:25.865 --> 00:21:30.206
physically, you know, I think of it like if you can

415
00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:34.078
visualise yourself as all the cells in your body,

416
00:21:34.078 --> 00:21:37.011
which is already a very, you know,

417
00:21:37.011 --> 00:21:40.488
to become aware of that level is very good.

418
00:21:40.488 --> 00:21:44.531
I generally say, now you've connected with the

419
00:21:44.531 --> 00:21:49.196
biological entity of our planet, the planetary field.

420
00:21:49.196 --> 00:21:53.558
And then, you know, if you go deeper

421
00:21:53.558 --> 00:21:56.257
and you start to connect with all the atoms

422
00:21:56.257 --> 00:21:58.667
that makes all of the cells of your body,

423
00:21:58.667 --> 00:22:02.592
now you've connected with the solar system field,

424
00:22:02.592 --> 00:22:05.568
you know because all the atoms, you know,

425
00:22:05.568 --> 00:22:08.213
all the material we see in our world actually

426
00:22:08.213 --> 00:22:11.712
came out of the sun and then, you know,

427
00:22:11.712 --> 00:22:14.549
and then I say if you go deeper and you connect with

428
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:17.941
the nuclei of the atom, you know, like the protons,

429
00:22:17.941 --> 00:22:20.938
now you've connected with the morphogenic field

430
00:22:20.938 --> 00:22:25.140
of the whole galaxy and thats what I call becoming

431
00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:30.036
the galactic being, you know, to actually start to

432
00:22:30.036 --> 00:22:34.814
become and be the awareness of the galaxy,

433
00:22:34.814 --> 00:22:39.305
to realise that you are floating inside a galaxy

434
00:22:39.305 --> 00:22:43.454
and you can choose to visualize yourself to

435
00:22:43.454 --> 00:22:47.379
experience the world from a galactic perspective

436
00:22:47.379 --> 00:22:51.187
and when you look at it from a galactic perspective,

437
00:22:51.187 --> 00:22:56.187
all of a sudden its very easy to see the earth as one,

438
00:22:56.552 --> 00:23:01.552
its very easy to blur the lines between, you know,

439
00:23:02.119 --> 00:23:05.052
the countries, between the differences that you see

440
00:23:05.052 --> 00:23:09.042
in personalities or in skin colours and so on,

441
00:23:09.042 --> 00:23:12.849
that all kind of goes away when you look at the earth

442
00:23:12.849 --> 00:23:14.620
from a galactic perspective.

443
00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.724
<v Voiceover>Take that conversely in what happens</v>

444
00:23:17.724 --> 00:23:21.531
in a very large percentage of lives of people on the planet,

445
00:23:21.531 --> 00:23:23.622
including a lot of people watching this right now,

446
00:23:23.622 --> 00:23:28.016
which is the opposite, magnetising reality is to them,

447
00:23:28.016 --> 00:23:31.792
that do not reflect what they desire out of

448
00:23:31.792 --> 00:23:34.768
fear, trauma, programming, whatever you want to call it.

449
00:23:34.768 --> 00:23:36.837
<v ->Thats right, we all do a certain amount of that</v>

450
00:23:36.837 --> 00:23:41.104
and you know, its part, I mean, its remarkable

451
00:23:41.104 --> 00:23:43.845
actually considering the world we live in,

452
00:23:43.845 --> 00:23:47.589
that we are able to actually survive the experience,

453
00:23:47.589 --> 00:23:50.074
you know, when you look at, you know,

454
00:23:50.074 --> 00:23:53.177
the first moments of birth on this planet,

455
00:23:53.177 --> 00:23:57.177
typically some serious trauma happens within the first

456
00:23:57.177 --> 00:24:00.430
10 minutes, I mean you know, this bright light,

457
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:02.585
you are pulled out of your mother,

458
00:24:02.585 --> 00:24:06.371
your umbilical cord is cut while still pulsing,

459
00:24:06.371 --> 00:24:09.198
you know, you are pulled away from your mother,

460
00:24:09.198 --> 00:24:11.939
you know, your head hung by your feet,

461
00:24:11.939 --> 00:24:13.891
I mean acid is put in your eyes,

462
00:24:13.891 --> 00:24:16.589
tubes are put up your nose, I mean,

463
00:24:16.589 --> 00:24:21.346
by then you have already serious trauma

464
00:24:21.346 --> 00:24:26.346
that has been implemented and then it goes on

465
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:33.610
you know and I think that so we all have

466
00:24:33.954 --> 00:24:37.484
a certain amount of that programming thats

467
00:24:37.484 --> 00:24:41.143
running in the background, that constantly self sabotages.

468
00:24:41.143 --> 00:24:42.838
<v Voiceover>Much of it collective programming but with</v>

469
00:24:42.838 --> 00:24:45.804
our own flavours, with our own individuated programming.

470
00:24:45.804 --> 00:24:48.246
<v ->Thats right and you know in our the way our</v>

471
00:24:48.246 --> 00:24:53.216
society is built, the technology we use is so precarious

472
00:24:53.216 --> 00:24:58.155
and so on that you know, our society is set up to

473
00:24:58.155 --> 00:25:01.483
continue the trauma, I mean you know, you are having

474
00:25:01.483 --> 00:25:06.483
a great day, you had a beautiful breakfast with your family

475
00:25:06.933 --> 00:25:10.111
and so on, you get in your car, next thing you know

476
00:25:10.111 --> 00:25:13.183
you are on the six lane highway, you know,

477
00:25:13.183 --> 00:25:16.287
everybody cutting you off and then you get into

478
00:25:16.287 --> 00:25:21.287
you know, traffic and I mean and remaining in that

479
00:25:22.719 --> 00:25:27.719
sense of the connectivity with the universe and,

480
00:25:28.788 --> 00:25:33.449
nothing in our society encourages that,

481
00:25:33.449 --> 00:25:38.099
or very little so its a very big effort, you know,

482
00:25:38.099 --> 00:25:41.160
for a person to actually take the time everyday,

483
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:46.160
to find that singularity, to find that point of stillness

484
00:25:46.166 --> 00:25:48.997
at the centre of their existence, which they can do in a

485
00:25:48.997 --> 00:25:53.997
few minutes, just by concentrated their energy towards

486
00:25:54.031 --> 00:25:57.498
the centre of their existence and to,

487
00:25:57.498 --> 00:26:02.498
throughout the day keep a log of how far they have gone

488
00:26:03.161 --> 00:26:06.521
from that point of stillness, into the spin,

489
00:26:06.521 --> 00:26:10.329
you can compare it to the centre of a hurricane,

490
00:26:10.329 --> 00:26:12.654
which is in that stillness right

491
00:26:12.654 --> 00:26:17.091
and the spin you know, which is extreme right at the edge

492
00:26:17.091 --> 00:26:20.158
of that stillness and

493
00:26:20.158 --> 00:26:22.483
<v Voiceover>We spent most of our time at the extreme edge.</v>

494
00:26:22.483 --> 00:26:24.968
<v ->Thats right, in that spin and</v>

495
00:26:24.968 --> 00:26:29.074
but if we take the time every morning to like

496
00:26:29.074 --> 00:26:32.231
connect with the stillness then at least we know

497
00:26:32.231 --> 00:26:33.629
how to get back to it.

498
00:26:33.629 --> 00:26:34.386
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

499
00:26:34.386 --> 00:26:38.620
<v ->So if we experience this spin throughout our day,</v>

500
00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.679
then we can go,"Oh, I'm spinning,

501
00:26:40.679 --> 00:26:42.908
"let me take a minute", you know,

502
00:26:42.908 --> 00:26:45.788
Excuse me, during the board meeting,

503
00:26:45.788 --> 00:26:47.462
"Excuse me I got to the washroom"

504
00:26:47.462 --> 00:26:52.156
and just like go back to that point of singularity,

505
00:26:52.156 --> 00:26:55.174
go back to that point of infinite potential,

506
00:26:55.174 --> 00:26:58.491
go back to that connection of the universe,

507
00:26:58.491 --> 00:27:03.163
all of the universe, every atom,

508
00:27:03.163 --> 00:27:06.619
all of the energy of the universe thats constantly

509
00:27:06.619 --> 00:27:09.850
supporting you and from that point,

510
00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:14.850
then again we are back into control into centre

511
00:27:14.863 --> 00:27:19.488
and then we can move to our day again.

512
00:27:19.488 --> 00:27:23.669
But if there is no monitoring of where we are

513
00:27:23.669 --> 00:27:28.108
relative to that centre, if we don't know where that

514
00:27:28.108 --> 00:27:32.159
centre is, there is no gauge for us to know

515
00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:34.719
how far we are in the spin.

516
00:27:34.719 --> 00:27:36.404
<v Voiceover>Very true</v>

517
00:27:36.404 --> 00:27:37.033
<v ->Yeah</v>

518
00:27:37.033 --> 00:27:38.686
<v Voiceover>Well lets take that to the</v>

519
00:27:38.686 --> 00:27:40.798
opposite extreme with individuals who have chosen to

520
00:27:40.798 --> 00:27:43.795
make their life the understanding of that stillness inside

521
00:27:43.795 --> 00:27:48.795
and you can find many of the great masters in India,

522
00:27:49.555 --> 00:27:53.309
who are in caves and who have brought their rice

523
00:27:53.309 --> 00:27:58.120
and have essentially a lack of materiality around them,

524
00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.042
on the most, the commonly understood level.

525
00:28:01.042 --> 00:28:03.549
How do you see that dense?

526
00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:06.130
This is just a personal, your personal opinion.

527
00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:08.989
How do you see that dense of living in that

528
00:28:08.989 --> 00:28:12.626
but not bouncing out to the other extremes

529
00:28:12.626 --> 00:28:17.626
which often requires a quieting of any and all desire,

530
00:28:18.321 --> 00:28:21.777
where do you see the role of desire?

531
00:28:21.777 --> 00:28:24.305
You see what I am saying?

532
00:28:24.305 --> 00:28:24.892
<v ->Yeah</v>

533
00:28:24.892 --> 00:28:26.001
<v Voiceover>From going to no desire</v>

534
00:28:26.001 --> 00:28:28.763
in this still experience of a bowl of rice a day

535
00:28:28.763 --> 00:28:31.270
and quietude and darkness and contemplatiion

536
00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:33.414
to living the we are living in these

537
00:28:33.414 --> 00:28:35.867
wild arrays of the creative process.

538
00:28:35.867 --> 00:28:40.283
<v ->I think that it maybe necessary for individuals to</v>

539
00:28:40.283 --> 00:28:42.693
take the time at one point in their life to

540
00:28:42.693 --> 00:28:46.970
quiet down and to get rid of all the extraneous stuff

541
00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:49.829
in their life so that they can find that stillness,

542
00:28:49.829 --> 00:28:53.978
if thats necessary but I think that

543
00:28:53.978 --> 00:28:58.489
any which way to the extreme, you know,

544
00:28:58.489 --> 00:29:02.244
is an imbalance and that was the greatest

545
00:29:02.244 --> 00:29:07.244
you know, the greatest discovery of the Buddha,

546
00:29:07.566 --> 00:29:10.937
which was walking the middle path,

547
00:29:10.937 --> 00:29:11.726
<v Voiceover>Exactly</v>

548
00:29:11.726 --> 00:29:16.726
<v ->The highest path the most erect path</v>

549
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.056
to enlightenment to assertion to

550
00:29:20.056 --> 00:29:23.512
the deepening of our existence is to actually be

551
00:29:23.512 --> 00:29:27.416
in balance between, you know, the material world

552
00:29:27.416 --> 00:29:30.253
and the spiritual world and that any imbalance

553
00:29:30.253 --> 00:29:35.253
in either way can lead to disaster

554
00:29:35.266 --> 00:29:40.266
and so that you know, it is easy to be always at centre

555
00:29:42.604 --> 00:29:45.686
if you are in a cave in some mountain

556
00:29:45.686 --> 00:29:48.726
and you don't have cell phones, you don't have

557
00:29:48.726 --> 00:29:49.686
<v Voiceover>No wives or children.</v>

558
00:29:49.686 --> 00:29:51.862
<v ->No wives, no children, you know,</v>

559
00:29:51.862 --> 00:29:55.211
nobody to argue with you first thing in the morning,

560
00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:58.016
you know, all this is, you know,

561
00:29:58.016 --> 00:30:00.488
so you eliminate all that then its easier

562
00:30:00.488 --> 00:30:03.528
and that might be necessary for you to find it first

563
00:30:03.528 --> 00:30:07.528
but then its important to actually be able to go back

564
00:30:07.528 --> 00:30:11.176
into the world and interact with the world

565
00:30:11.176 --> 00:30:16.176
and you see how well you can maintain that relationship

566
00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:21.370
and you know and I think thats really now whats necessary

567
00:30:22.151 --> 00:30:27.151
is the path of the masters today have to do both

568
00:30:27.196 --> 00:30:31.228
and I think we are all walking into our mastery

569
00:30:31.228 --> 00:30:33.745
in that sense, you know, its no longer

570
00:30:33.745 --> 00:30:36.945
appropriate for the spiritual people to

571
00:30:36.945 --> 00:30:39.078
go in their cave and say,

572
00:30:39.078 --> 00:30:41.104
"We don't need the material world"

573
00:30:41.104 --> 00:30:43.792
and its no longer appropriate for the physicists

574
00:30:43.792 --> 00:30:45.753
to go into their laboratories and say

575
00:30:45.753 --> 00:30:47.695
"We don't need the spiritual world"

576
00:30:47.695 --> 00:30:51.086
that the two come together and eventually

577
00:30:51.086 --> 00:30:54.297
its found that they are not separate things,

578
00:30:54.297 --> 00:30:57.539
they are the same thing, that the material world

579
00:30:57.539 --> 00:31:00.078
is as you know the spiritual world

580
00:31:00.078 --> 00:31:02.424
and the spiritual world is the material world,

581
00:31:02.424 --> 00:31:04.995
its never the egg or the chicken, its always both.

582
00:31:06.985 --> 00:31:08.813
<v ->To dove deeper into Nassim's theory</v>

583
00:31:08.813 --> 00:31:11.256
you can purchase his DVD set through his site

584
00:31:11.256 --> 00:31:14.274
theresonanceproject.org, meanwhile next month

585
00:31:14.274 --> 00:31:17.432
we will talk more with Nassim regarding ancient technologies

586
00:31:17.432 --> 00:31:20.077
and how the clues left behind are impacting

587
00:31:20.077 --> 00:31:22.583
our evolution in science today.

588
00:31:22.583 --> 00:31:27.042
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
