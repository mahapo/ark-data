00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:17.040
<v ->We continue our examination of the subjects</v>

3
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.703
delivered to the public through Edgar Cayce,

4
00:00:19.703 --> 00:00:21.918
from what he called, his source.

5
00:00:21.918 --> 00:00:23.909
The source regularly spoke of the value

6
00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:25.777
in choosing to remember our dreams

7
00:00:25.777 --> 00:00:29.088
as messages from the divine part of ourselves.

8
00:00:29.088 --> 00:00:31.037
The father of modern day dream therapy,

9
00:00:31.037 --> 00:00:33.740
and debutee of Cayce's work, Henry Reed,

10
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.466
offers us a view of dreaming

11
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:38.149
I've never been exposed to in all my years of research.

12
00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.870
He says, dreaming on behalf of others

13
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.346
is one of the best incentives to remember our dreams.

14
00:00:44.346 --> 00:00:46.234
Henry shared his maverick journey

15
00:00:46.234 --> 00:00:48.103
of bringing dream state to a new,

16
00:00:48.103 --> 00:00:50.882
more useful level for humanity.

17
00:00:52.603 --> 00:00:53.599
<v Voiceover>It was fun, I just sat in on</v>

18
00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:54.454
your workshop.

19
00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.016
Thank you so much for taking the time,

20
00:00:56.016 --> 00:00:58.089
I mean, you put a lot of energy out

21
00:00:58.089 --> 00:00:59.146
when you're speaking.

22
00:00:59.146 --> 00:01:00.427
And you have everybody laughing.

23
00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:01.258
<v ->Yeah.
(laughing)

24
00:01:01.258 --> 00:01:03.108
<v Voiceover>We're laughing half the time.</v>

25
00:01:03.108 --> 00:01:05.382
But there was some really profound information

26
00:01:05.382 --> 00:01:07.170
that was coming out of this, and one area

27
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.877
I thought we might hone in on

28
00:01:08.877 --> 00:01:10.747
is your work with dreams.

29
00:01:10.747 --> 00:01:13.390
I mean, you were a union, initially,

30
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.052
union psychoanalyist, or certainly

31
00:01:16.052 --> 00:01:17.799
going that direction.

32
00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.501
<v ->Well, I made my name for myself with dreams,</v>

33
00:01:20.501 --> 00:01:22.613
but it's a mixed thing for me

34
00:01:22.613 --> 00:01:25.584
because dreams wasn't really what I was doing.

35
00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:28.083
I was called the father of the modern dream work

36
00:01:28.083 --> 00:01:31.781
movement, because, as they say, I rescue dreams

37
00:01:31.781 --> 00:01:34.951
from psychotherapy by creating this journal

38
00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:36.983
that showed how many people out there

39
00:01:36.983 --> 00:01:39.461
in the world were using their dreams on their own

40
00:01:39.461 --> 00:01:41.269
for constructive purposes.

41
00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:43.302
And when you see something in print like that,

42
00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:46.389
and we had six issues of the journal,

43
00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:48.909
it spread far and wide.

44
00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.778
And psychologists and so on, they look

45
00:01:50.778 --> 00:01:52.057
and say, "Gosh, I know.

46
00:01:52.057 --> 00:01:53.500
"We better catch up."

47
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.492
When I started I was a graduate student

48
00:01:55.492 --> 00:01:57.727
at UCLA in the 60s.

49
00:01:57.727 --> 00:01:59.859
And dreams were looked at as like a

50
00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:01.445
medical sample, something you take

51
00:02:01.445 --> 00:02:02.866
to the doctor.
(laughing)

52
00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:04.289
Here, you look at my dream

53
00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.097
and you tell me what's wrong with me.

54
00:02:06.097 --> 00:02:08.374
Then it would be done in extreme privacy.

55
00:02:08.374 --> 00:02:10.019
Because you know there's only gonna be

56
00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.806
shit in that poop.
(laughing)

57
00:02:11.806 --> 00:02:13.838
And that was our attitude about dreams.

58
00:02:13.838 --> 00:02:14.853
<v Voiceover>Really?</v>
<v ->So you wouldn't,</v>

59
00:02:14.853 --> 00:02:16.626
think, well I mean, back in the 60s

60
00:02:16.626 --> 00:02:17.865
when you go to a party and say,

61
00:02:17.865 --> 00:02:19.795
"Hey, let me tell you about my dreams."

62
00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:20.446
You know.

63
00:02:20.446 --> 00:02:21.644
And if somebody mentioned a dream

64
00:02:21.644 --> 00:02:22.986
at a party, everybody would make

65
00:02:22.986 --> 00:02:24.387
a joke about it, you know?

66
00:02:24.387 --> 00:02:27.130
There was really no way for people

67
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.573
to talk about dreams the way they

68
00:02:28.573 --> 00:02:30.096
talk about the stock market,

69
00:02:30.096 --> 00:02:30.991
about the weather,

70
00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:32.250
about their kids.

71
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.789
Dreams were isolated as a topic

72
00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:37.349
for professionals to deal with.

73
00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:38.366
All right?
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

74
00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:39.746
<v ->That was the attitude</v>

75
00:02:39.746 --> 00:02:42.347
when I was a graduate student there,

76
00:02:42.347 --> 00:02:43.831
and you read about it,

77
00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:46.451
that a counselor maybe helps somebody

78
00:02:46.451 --> 00:02:49.580
because they interpreted somebodys dream.

79
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.420
Well, a friend of mine, who is our college

80
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.473
president when we were at Pomona College.

81
00:02:56.473 --> 00:02:57.834
While I was a graduate student

82
00:02:57.834 --> 00:03:01.166
James Turell, he's won one of those genius awards

83
00:03:01.166 --> 00:03:02.285
now, you know?

84
00:03:02.285 --> 00:03:04.885
Back then he was just one of my classmates.

85
00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:07.952
He was telling me about these dreams he had.

86
00:03:07.952 --> 00:03:11.020
He had this fantastic studio

87
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.523
on the beach in Santa Monica,

88
00:03:12.523 --> 00:03:14.698
and he had no visible means of support.

89
00:03:14.698 --> 00:03:17.156
I asked him, "Well James, how did you get this place?"

90
00:03:17.156 --> 00:03:18.762
He said, "Well I had a dream.

91
00:03:18.762 --> 00:03:20.995
"My father, who's dead, he came to me

92
00:03:20.995 --> 00:03:22.377
"and he showed me this house.

93
00:03:22.377 --> 00:03:23.718
"He said, "You could have a studio

94
00:03:23.718 --> 00:03:25.100
"here for free.""

95
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.807
And he said, "I drove all over L.A.

96
00:03:26.807 --> 00:03:29.244
"looking for this house, and I found it right here.

97
00:03:29.244 --> 00:03:31.591
"And it was a man who wanted the house renovated

98
00:03:31.591 --> 00:03:34.059
"and I'm good at carpentry, so hes giving me

99
00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.852
"this place."

100
00:03:34.852 --> 00:03:36.599
I said, "That's fantastic."

101
00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.143
And then a couple weeks later I says,

102
00:03:38.143 --> 00:03:39.179
"Jim, where have you been?

103
00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:40.459
He said, "You know, I had a dream."

104
00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:41.740
(laughing)
"A friend of mine was upset

105
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.858
"in San Fransisco.

106
00:03:42.858 --> 00:03:44.016
"Went up on my motorcycle ,

107
00:03:44.016 --> 00:03:45.234
"and they were in trouble.

108
00:03:45.234 --> 00:03:46.778
"I was able to help them out."

109
00:03:46.778 --> 00:03:48.201
I said, "James, where did you learn

110
00:03:48.201 --> 00:03:49.825
"how to dream like this?

111
00:03:49.825 --> 00:03:51.045
"We're not learning about dreams

112
00:03:51.045 --> 00:03:52.102
'like this in school.

113
00:03:52.102 --> 00:03:53.971
"To us, you know, it's a medical sample.

114
00:03:53.971 --> 00:03:56.164
"You're using dreams to steer your life,

115
00:03:56.164 --> 00:03:57.851
"to do these creative things.

116
00:03:57.851 --> 00:03:59.111
"Where did you learn about that?"

117
00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:00.737
He said, "Edgar Cayce."

118
00:04:00.737 --> 00:04:01.609
<v Voiceover>A-ha.</v>
<v ->Edgar Cayce.</v>

119
00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.600
I didn't know Edgar Cayce.

120
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.287
He explained to me a little bit about

121
00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:06.425
Edgar Cayce.

122
00:04:06.425 --> 00:04:07.807
And to me, he was a person who

123
00:04:07.807 --> 00:04:09.981
when he was asleep, was a lot smarter

124
00:04:09.981 --> 00:04:12.215
than he was when he was awake.

125
00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:13.516
(laughing)
And I was studying

126
00:04:13.516 --> 00:04:16.177
amnesias, multiple personalties,

127
00:04:16.177 --> 00:04:18.555
trying to understand what it is

128
00:04:18.555 --> 00:04:22.312
in the personality that shifts as to your memory.

129
00:04:22.312 --> 00:04:24.242
How come a person can be amnesiac

130
00:04:24.242 --> 00:04:26.294
for who they are, but still speak English?

131
00:04:26.294 --> 00:04:27.371
You know, that's kind of weird.

132
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:29.465
And they still have their talents.

133
00:04:29.465 --> 00:04:31.455
So here's a guy I thought was kind of

134
00:04:31.455 --> 00:04:33.833
curious, you know, that he had these talents

135
00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:35.843
when he was asleep.

136
00:04:35.843 --> 00:04:37.509
But that's all, I didn't pay much more attention

137
00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:38.566
to it than that.

138
00:04:38.566 --> 00:04:39.806
But my friend James, he said,

139
00:04:39.806 --> 00:04:43.306
"You need to keep a dream journal."

140
00:04:43.381 --> 00:04:44.112
"I do?"

141
00:04:44.112 --> 00:04:44.986
"Yeah."

142
00:04:44.986 --> 00:04:46.960
And so he helped me actually glue together

143
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.456
some pages, and made a fancy thing

144
00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:51.975
so I could start remembering my dreams.

145
00:04:51.975 --> 00:04:55.023
So I remember it was on New Years Eve,

146
00:04:55.023 --> 00:04:57.096
you know, when you make resolutions?

147
00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:59.675
And I was a drunk, and I was really confused

148
00:04:59.675 --> 00:05:01.057
in graduate school and stuff.

149
00:05:01.057 --> 00:05:02.723
I didn't know what I was gonna do with my life.

150
00:05:02.723 --> 00:05:05.140
And I said, "Maybe dreams would help me out."

151
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.066
So I put this journal under my pillow

152
00:05:08.066 --> 00:05:11.865
on a December 31st, January 1, 1967,

153
00:05:11.865 --> 00:05:14.019
is gonna be the first day of my new life.

154
00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:15.117
And guess what?

155
00:05:15.117 --> 00:05:16.315
I didn't remember a dream.

156
00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:17.738
(laughing)

157
00:05:17.738 --> 00:05:20.236
I didn't remember one until April.

158
00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:21.766
April!

159
00:05:21.983 --> 00:05:24.158
And I almost forgot it, but I was

160
00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:26.108
just reaching into the closet

161
00:05:26.108 --> 00:05:28.546
to put on a shirt, and all of a sudden

162
00:05:28.546 --> 00:05:31.310
I remembered seeing this flying goat.

163
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.589
And I couldn't think of,

164
00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:34.905
I haven't been around any flying goats.

165
00:05:34.905 --> 00:05:35.719
(laughing)
And I said that

166
00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:36.916
maybe that's what it's like

167
00:05:36.916 --> 00:05:38.178
to remember a dream.

168
00:05:38.178 --> 00:05:40.086
And I sit back down

169
00:05:40.086 --> 00:05:41.995
and it starts coming to me.

170
00:05:41.995 --> 00:05:43.525
This dream.

171
00:05:43.906 --> 00:05:46.221
And this is a fantastic dream,

172
00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:48.497
about this wise old man

173
00:05:48.497 --> 00:05:50.494
who has flying goats.

174
00:05:50.753 --> 00:05:52.479
And I'm getting to be on his property.

175
00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.654
I'm gonna be learning these skills.

176
00:05:54.654 --> 00:05:56.421
Of what, he's very special.

177
00:05:56.421 --> 00:05:58.677
And then I see there's this haystack

178
00:05:58.677 --> 00:06:00.687
with an empty bottle of wine.

179
00:06:00.687 --> 00:06:02.414
And an empty bag of potato chips,

180
00:06:02.414 --> 00:06:04.203
and I see that there's been some drunkard

181
00:06:04.203 --> 00:06:07.615
whose been sneaking onto his property.

182
00:06:07.615 --> 00:06:09.898
And boozing it up.

183
00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:11.536
And I get righteously indignant.

184
00:06:11.536 --> 00:06:12.451
"We got to kick out,

185
00:06:12.451 --> 00:06:13.650
"we got to find this drunkard

186
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.295
"and kick him out."

187
00:06:15.295 --> 00:06:16.433
And the old man says,

188
00:06:16.433 --> 00:06:17.998
in this compassionate voice,

189
00:06:17.998 --> 00:06:19.852
it just shrivels me.

190
00:06:19.907 --> 00:06:21.675
"This man, he's my guest.

191
00:06:21.675 --> 00:06:23.544
"And he's been here a lot longer than you

192
00:06:23.544 --> 00:06:24.825
"who just arrived.

193
00:06:24.825 --> 00:06:26.571
"And I put that food down there,

194
00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:28.298
"those potato chips to feed him

195
00:06:28.298 --> 00:06:29.801
"so that he can come in

196
00:06:29.801 --> 00:06:32.322
"so that I can serve him the wine."

197
00:06:32.322 --> 00:06:34.027
And I'm looking at all this, this is going

198
00:06:34.027 --> 00:06:36.201
totally against my thinking,

199
00:06:36.201 --> 00:06:38.985
and I'm totally ashamed and embarrassed

200
00:06:38.985 --> 00:06:41.016
and I just sort of, "Well, excuse me."

201
00:06:41.016 --> 00:06:43.618
And back away and go off to the forest.

202
00:06:43.618 --> 00:06:45.141
<v Voiceover>What a profound dream.</v>

203
00:06:45.141 --> 00:06:46.245
<v ->Yeah!</v>

204
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.825
And I wake up, and I'm thinking,

205
00:06:47.825 --> 00:06:49.144
you know, I was awake already,

206
00:06:49.144 --> 00:06:50.383
"This is a dream."

207
00:06:50.383 --> 00:06:51.480
And I'm, "What does this mean?"

208
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.305
And I don't ever remember having the dream.

209
00:06:54.305 --> 00:06:56.417
It's years later that I start remembering

210
00:06:56.417 --> 00:06:57.778
childhood dreams.

211
00:06:57.778 --> 00:06:59.708
I was totally cut off.

212
00:06:59.708 --> 00:07:02.613
And I could connect, I'm Capricorn, goats.

213
00:07:02.613 --> 00:07:04.910
And some people say maybe I have a

214
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.108
drinking problem.

215
00:07:06.108 --> 00:07:07.409
I wouldn't have said so.

216
00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:08.933
<v Voiceover>But now you would. (laughing)</v>

217
00:07:08.933 --> 00:07:11.472
<v ->But then he made it seem different.</v>

218
00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:13.464
Like he was feeding the guy.

219
00:07:13.464 --> 00:07:15.069
So it really kind of played

220
00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:17.710
with my whole feeling about drinking.

221
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.107
And so that was the beginning.

222
00:07:20.107 --> 00:07:22.119
And it was a year later that I remembered

223
00:07:22.119 --> 00:07:23.926
my second dream.

224
00:07:23.926 --> 00:07:25.490
That's how hard it was.

225
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.971
I graduated with my doctorate from UCLA.

226
00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:30.671
I'm gonna now start teaching at Princeton

227
00:07:30.671 --> 00:07:34.111
University, newly minted assistant professor.

228
00:07:34.694 --> 00:07:37.417
And I'm gonna teach dream recall

229
00:07:37.417 --> 00:07:38.982
as my first class.

230
00:07:38.982 --> 00:07:41.012
Because I realized there's nothing

231
00:07:41.012 --> 00:07:42.070
in the literature.

232
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.532
There's a hundred studies, I had them

233
00:07:43.532 --> 00:07:44.893
stacked up real high.

234
00:07:44.893 --> 00:07:46.864
All these studies on factors affecting

235
00:07:46.864 --> 00:07:48.307
dream recall.

236
00:07:48.307 --> 00:07:51.091
From, girls remember more than boys,

237
00:07:51.091 --> 00:07:53.142
artists remember more than non-artists,

238
00:07:53.142 --> 00:07:54.239
blah blah blah blah blah.

239
00:07:54.239 --> 00:07:56.250
But not a single article on,

240
00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.079
what can you do to improve your

241
00:07:58.079 --> 00:07:59.380
memory for dreams.

242
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.964
Because it wasn't really,

243
00:08:00.964 --> 00:08:02.041
I talked to a (mumbling).

244
00:08:02.041 --> 00:08:03.017
Well we just assume it's

245
00:08:03.017 --> 00:08:05.312
dreams will naturally happen.

246
00:08:05.312 --> 00:08:07.141
So no one had ever tried

247
00:08:07.141 --> 00:08:08.320
to see what could happen.

248
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.915
So, like I said, I was a newly minted professor,

249
00:08:11.915 --> 00:08:14.353
and I'm telling you this because

250
00:08:14.353 --> 00:08:15.836
this is really important to this,

251
00:08:15.836 --> 00:08:18.335
about what happened with me and dreams.

252
00:08:18.335 --> 00:08:20.713
This is sort of a theme.

253
00:08:20.713 --> 00:08:22.745
There was a psychologist in Florida

254
00:08:22.745 --> 00:08:24.410
who's dead now, because he was working

255
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.342
on his sports car and it fell on him.

256
00:08:27.782 --> 00:08:30.770
And I'm trying to think,

257
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:32.496
Sidney Jourard is his name,

258
00:08:32.496 --> 00:08:33.452
and he wrote a book called,

259
00:08:33.452 --> 00:08:35.807
"Disclosing Man to Himself."

260
00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:37.292
And he wrote another book called,

261
00:08:37.292 --> 00:08:39.322
"The Transparent Self."

262
00:08:39.322 --> 00:08:42.127
And his argument was that we would have

263
00:08:42.127 --> 00:08:43.996
a much more better psychology,

264
00:08:43.996 --> 00:08:45.947
a much more relevant psychology,

265
00:08:45.947 --> 00:08:48.912
if psychologists didn't treat people like rats.

266
00:08:48.912 --> 00:08:51.620
And instead, talked to them.

267
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.439
What I, and dialogue with them.

268
00:08:54.439 --> 00:08:56.470
And when I arrived at Princeton,

269
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.030
it was the hot bed for deceptive research

270
00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.122
in social psychology

271
00:09:01.122 --> 00:09:04.576
where the students would be told their

272
00:09:04.576 --> 00:09:07.055
coming here to do this, or that,

273
00:09:07.055 --> 00:09:09.554
but that really wasn't what was going on.

274
00:09:09.554 --> 00:09:10.915
<v Voiceover>They were lab rats themselves?</v>

275
00:09:10.915 --> 00:09:12.446
<v ->Yeah, uh huh.</v>

276
00:09:12.744 --> 00:09:14.552
And I said, "Well I'm not gonna do

277
00:09:14.552 --> 00:09:15.528
"anything like that."

278
00:09:15.528 --> 00:09:17.092
"And instead of paying students

279
00:09:17.092 --> 00:09:18.128
"to be in my experiments,

280
00:09:18.128 --> 00:09:19.530
"I'm gonna charge them

281
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:20.688
"to be in my experiments.

282
00:09:20.688 --> 00:09:22.029
"Because they're gonna learn something

283
00:09:22.029 --> 00:09:24.183
"because I'm gonna dialogue with them

284
00:09:24.183 --> 00:09:25.361
"about this."

285
00:09:25.361 --> 00:09:27.413
And we started

286
00:09:27.413 --> 00:09:29.141
and the university, the professors

287
00:09:29.141 --> 00:09:30.176
got really mad at me,

288
00:09:30.176 --> 00:09:31.680
because here I was charging people

289
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.939
to be in my experiments

290
00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:35.478
and really criticizing deception.

291
00:09:35.478 --> 00:09:36.616
You know.

292
00:09:36.616 --> 00:09:38.324
Because I'm trying to enlist the students

293
00:09:38.324 --> 00:09:39.501
co-operation.

294
00:09:39.501 --> 00:09:41.208
Let's see what we can do with recall.

295
00:09:41.208 --> 00:09:42.386
Let's see what we can do about

296
00:09:42.386 --> 00:09:43.483
remembering our dreams.

297
00:09:43.483 --> 00:09:44.805
Let's see what effects.

298
00:09:44.805 --> 00:09:46.368
Let's see how we might measure.

299
00:09:46.368 --> 00:09:48.442
Let's see how we might explore this.

300
00:09:48.442 --> 00:09:49.783
And they all wanted to, you know.

301
00:09:49.783 --> 00:09:52.768
And together we ended up writing a paper

302
00:09:52.768 --> 00:09:54.476
that got published in The Journal of Humanistic

303
00:09:54.476 --> 00:09:55.978
Psychology.

304
00:09:55.978 --> 00:09:59.028
The students experiments about what they,

305
00:09:59.028 --> 00:10:01.831
what kinds of things they needed to do,

306
00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:04.391
they learned to improve their dream recall.

307
00:10:04.391 --> 00:10:07.585
And that was really neat.

308
00:10:08.412 --> 00:10:10.850
So then--
<v Voiceover>I hope at some</v>

309
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.029
point you'll share with me

310
00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:13.349
what some of those things are.

311
00:10:13.349 --> 00:10:14.954
In this conversation.

312
00:10:14.954 --> 00:10:16.302
<v ->Uhhh.</v>

313
00:10:16.417 --> 00:10:17.556
<v Voiceover>I don't want to stop your flow.</v>

314
00:10:17.556 --> 00:10:18.347
<v ->Okay.
<v Voiceover>But at some</v>

315
00:10:18.347 --> 00:10:19.608
point we'll talk about that.

316
00:10:19.608 --> 00:10:20.400
<v ->Right, all right.</v>

317
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.415
<v Voiceover>Practical stuff there too.</v>

318
00:10:21.415 --> 00:10:24.002
<v ->The, the uh.</v>

319
00:10:25.866 --> 00:10:28.343
Yeah, now I forget what--
<v Voiceover>Oh so</v>

320
00:10:28.343 --> 00:10:29.563
so you guys had practiced.

321
00:10:29.563 --> 00:10:30.944
<v ->I'm going into, I'm going.</v>

322
00:10:30.944 --> 00:10:34.418
The, I go to The Managers Foundation

323
00:10:34.418 --> 00:10:36.592
for a council growth conference

324
00:10:36.592 --> 00:10:38.421
my second year of Princeton.

325
00:10:38.421 --> 00:10:40.432
I'm already in hot water at Princeton

326
00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:42.688
because of this experiment that I did.

327
00:10:42.688 --> 00:10:44.678
I'm violating all their rules,

328
00:10:44.678 --> 00:10:47.949
but I feel I'm really doing something superior,

329
00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:50.956
process-wise, than what they're doing.

330
00:10:50.956 --> 00:10:54.491
I go to The Managers, the council growth conference.

331
00:10:54.491 --> 00:10:55.852
Which they have every year for

332
00:10:55.852 --> 00:10:57.722
researchers on the cutting edge

333
00:10:57.722 --> 00:10:58.981
in consciousness.

334
00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:01.359
This goes back to '72.

335
00:11:01.359 --> 00:11:03.471
And I meet there a man who's asking me

336
00:11:03.471 --> 00:11:04.772
about what I do, and I'm talking about

337
00:11:04.772 --> 00:11:06.763
the trouble that I'm getting into because

338
00:11:06.763 --> 00:11:09.384
I'm doing research where I'm really trying

339
00:11:09.384 --> 00:11:12.350
to take a different approach to the people.

340
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.016
Because we're trying to see what we can

341
00:11:14.016 --> 00:11:15.479
accomplish.

342
00:11:15.479 --> 00:11:17.429
You know, I kept using the idea

343
00:11:17.429 --> 00:11:18.994
of getting a man on the moon.

344
00:11:18.994 --> 00:11:20.234
And if you got a man on the moon

345
00:11:20.234 --> 00:11:22.224
you wouldn't be worried about a control group,

346
00:11:22.224 --> 00:11:23.931
you'd just try to put everything together

347
00:11:23.931 --> 00:11:26.470
to maximize the chances of getting there.

348
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:27.324
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->You know?</v>

349
00:11:27.324 --> 00:11:28.218
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->And that's what</v>

350
00:11:28.218 --> 00:11:28.991
I was trying to do,

351
00:11:28.991 --> 00:11:30.310
was see the mazimize the chances

352
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.362
that these people could come away

353
00:11:32.362 --> 00:11:33.571
with the fuller dream recall

354
00:11:33.571 --> 00:11:36.121
and feel that this was something for them.

355
00:11:36.121 --> 00:11:36.933
<v Voiceover>And using collective</v>

356
00:11:36.933 --> 00:11:39.602
human intelligence.
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>

357
00:11:40.185 --> 00:11:42.927
So I'm talking to this guy at Managers,

358
00:11:42.927 --> 00:11:45.488
he says, "Funny, but my granddad always

359
00:11:45.488 --> 00:11:47.743
"said that would be, we would make a lot

360
00:11:47.743 --> 00:11:49.550
"more progress if we would do research

361
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:51.989
"like that, instead of the way we normally do it."

362
00:11:51.989 --> 00:11:53.715
And I said, "Oh, who is your granddad?"

363
00:11:53.715 --> 00:11:55.320
"Edgar Cayce.
(laughing)

364
00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.288
I was talking to Edgar Charles Thomas Cayce.

365
00:11:58.288 --> 00:11:59.994
(laughing)
His grandson.

366
00:11:59.994 --> 00:12:01.314
<v Voiceover>Amazing.</v>
<v ->And that was funny</v>

367
00:12:01.314 --> 00:12:03.935
because now I was hearing his name a lot,

368
00:12:03.935 --> 00:12:06.191
because my inaugural lecturer at Princeton

369
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:07.653
a student comes up to me.

370
00:12:07.653 --> 00:12:10.375
I was able to teach the first four credit

371
00:12:10.375 --> 00:12:12.630
class on humanistic psychology

372
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.520
offered in the United States.

373
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.589
And my first lecture a student comes up to me

374
00:12:17.589 --> 00:12:18.908
and says, "The way you're talking

375
00:12:18.908 --> 00:12:21.895
"you should really go investigate Edgar Cayce."

376
00:12:21.895 --> 00:12:23.642
I said, "Oh, I've heard of that name before."

377
00:12:23.642 --> 00:12:24.821
<v Voiceover>Third time's a charm, yeah.</v>

378
00:12:24.821 --> 00:12:25.715
<v ->You know.</v>

379
00:12:25.715 --> 00:12:27.665
It turned out he was from Virginia Beach.

380
00:12:27.665 --> 00:12:29.737
And he pointed out that Route 13

381
00:12:29.737 --> 00:12:31.506
goes form Princeton to Virginia Beach

382
00:12:31.506 --> 00:12:33.334
and I could go down to ARE.

383
00:12:33.334 --> 00:12:33.801
(laughing)
And so when I

384
00:12:33.801 --> 00:12:35.345
met Charles Thomas in Kansas

385
00:12:35.345 --> 00:12:38.373
he invites me to come to Virginia Beach.

386
00:12:38.373 --> 00:12:41.705
And I start designing kind of

387
00:12:41.705 --> 00:12:44.732
research as a part of their middle name.

388
00:12:44.732 --> 00:12:48.084
So here is a community,

389
00:12:48.084 --> 00:12:50.928
different from the academic community,

390
00:12:50.928 --> 00:12:53.002
where people are willing to try experiments.

391
00:12:53.002 --> 00:12:54.666
I say, "Hold on all of a sudden I've got people

392
00:12:54.666 --> 00:12:58.269
"so we can do research in a way that I want to."

393
00:12:59.563 --> 00:13:01.860
And so the first way we did it was

394
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.318
the dream research project

395
00:13:04.318 --> 00:13:06.228
where I wanted to show

396
00:13:06.228 --> 00:13:08.726
using Edgar Cayce's idea,

397
00:13:08.726 --> 00:13:11.956
that people at home, with no professional

398
00:13:11.956 --> 00:13:15.349
training, can make constructive use of their

399
00:13:15.349 --> 00:13:16.610
dreams on their own.

400
00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:19.155
And that's very important.

401
00:13:19.575 --> 00:13:22.664
And the one thing that Cayce had to offer to this,

402
00:13:22.664 --> 00:13:25.657
was this, a very interesting idea.

403
00:13:26.076 --> 00:13:27.113
Though if you think about it,

404
00:13:27.113 --> 00:13:28.230
you'd say, Of course.

405
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:29.835
And I found an indigenous person

406
00:13:29.835 --> 00:13:31.907
who followed it, so it is indigenous

407
00:13:31.907 --> 00:13:33.228
to the human mind.

408
00:13:33.228 --> 00:13:35.625
Which is really where Edgar Cayce is talking from.

409
00:13:35.625 --> 00:13:38.124
he's talking from the depths of the human mind

410
00:13:38.124 --> 00:13:39.495
and it applies to all of us.

411
00:13:39.495 --> 00:13:41.518
So he said this,

412
00:13:41.518 --> 00:13:44.179
"Your dreams will teach you

413
00:13:44.179 --> 00:13:45.459
"how to work with them

414
00:13:45.459 --> 00:13:47.843
"if you'll do the following.

415
00:13:49.604 --> 00:13:53.165
"Pick something of life improvement

416
00:13:53.911 --> 00:13:56.430
"that would be very constructive for you.

417
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:58.543
"That's consistent with your ideal."

418
00:13:58.543 --> 00:14:01.144
So like get an exercise program

419
00:14:01.144 --> 00:14:03.507
that you can stick with.

420
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:06.548
Improve your relationship with your

421
00:14:06.548 --> 00:14:07.976
spouse.

422
00:14:09.453 --> 00:14:11.872
Spend more time in meaningful

423
00:14:11.872 --> 00:14:13.579
quiet time.

424
00:14:13.579 --> 00:14:14.471
Whatever.

425
00:14:14.471 --> 00:14:16.078
But something constructive.

426
00:14:16.078 --> 00:14:19.510
And start by

427
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:21.319
taking any little step

428
00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:24.143
that you know that you could take

429
00:14:24.143 --> 00:14:27.231
that would move you in that direction.

430
00:14:27.231 --> 00:14:29.912
Say, with exercise, it might be that every day

431
00:14:29.912 --> 00:14:32.148
you would at least stand outside for a moment.

432
00:14:32.148 --> 00:14:32.941
(laughing)

433
00:14:32.941 --> 00:14:35.134
Get up out of your chair and stand outside.

434
00:14:35.134 --> 00:14:35.926
<v Voiceover>A baby step.</v>

435
00:14:35.926 --> 00:14:38.019
<v ->A baby step, exactly.</v>

436
00:14:38.019 --> 00:14:41.316
Waiting then for a dream to come along,

437
00:14:41.575 --> 00:14:44.541
then you will assume is commenting

438
00:14:44.541 --> 00:14:46.085
on your baby step.

439
00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:47.507
It's assume it.

440
00:14:48.677 --> 00:14:51.062
Do whatever you want

441
00:14:51.062 --> 00:14:53.155
to come up with what you think

442
00:14:53.155 --> 00:14:55.024
the dream is saying.

443
00:14:55.024 --> 00:14:56.893
Whatever you want.

444
00:14:56.893 --> 00:14:58.215
It might just be intuitive.

445
00:14:58.215 --> 00:14:59.433
It could be that

446
00:14:59.433 --> 00:15:01.567
the children's camp the way we do it is

447
00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:03.720
think of a color that you saw

448
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.081
in your dream last night,

449
00:15:05.081 --> 00:15:07.296
and wear that color today.

450
00:15:07.296 --> 00:15:09.409
So we make it really simple for the kids.

451
00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:10.567
Okay?

452
00:15:10.567 --> 00:15:11.462
<v Voiceover>That's good.</v>

453
00:15:11.462 --> 00:15:13.636
<v ->And so, maybe, you know,</v>

454
00:15:13.636 --> 00:15:16.357
the first few days you stood outside

455
00:15:16.357 --> 00:15:17.637
for 10 seconds.

456
00:15:17.637 --> 00:15:18.734
waiting for a dream.

457
00:15:18.734 --> 00:15:19.751
If you were like me, you had to

458
00:15:19.751 --> 00:15:21.011
wait three months.
(laughing)

459
00:15:21.011 --> 00:15:23.266
Before a dream comes.

460
00:15:23.266 --> 00:15:25.947
And maybe you have a dream eating chicken.

461
00:15:25.947 --> 00:15:27.775
So what does that have to do with exercise?

462
00:15:27.775 --> 00:15:29.300
I don't know, but chickens run around.

463
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.132
Okay.

464
00:15:30.132 --> 00:15:31.921
I will go outside and I will

465
00:15:31.921 --> 00:15:34.359
run around like a chicken for a minute.

466
00:15:34.359 --> 00:15:35.578
Okay?
<v Voiceover>Uh huh.</v>

467
00:15:35.578 --> 00:15:37.934
<v ->And so you're doing something</v>

468
00:15:37.934 --> 00:15:39.621
that you think your dreams are

469
00:15:39.621 --> 00:15:40.819
telling you to do.

470
00:15:40.819 --> 00:15:42.464
You could be wrong, it doesn't matter.

471
00:15:42.464 --> 00:15:44.516
This is very important.

472
00:15:44.516 --> 00:15:46.548
Because people think, "Oh, I can't work

473
00:15:46.548 --> 00:15:47.706
"with my dreams because how would

474
00:15:47.706 --> 00:15:50.223
"I know if I was doing it right?

475
00:15:50.693 --> 00:15:52.380
"How would I know if I'd have

476
00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.762
"the right interpretation?"

477
00:15:55.914 --> 00:15:58.536
And that's like asking now.

478
00:15:58.536 --> 00:15:59.877
No one knows this is a

479
00:15:59.877 --> 00:16:01.948
really interesting parallel.

480
00:16:01.948 --> 00:16:04.630
Just like asking a scientist,

481
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.642
"How do you know that your theory

482
00:16:06.642 --> 00:16:08.295
"is really true?"

483
00:16:08.612 --> 00:16:11.051
Well, an honest scientist will say,

484
00:16:11.051 --> 00:16:14.037
"We don't expect our theories to be true.

485
00:16:14.037 --> 00:16:16.740
"We're constantly modifying our theories

486
00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.035
"so we're constantly disproving our theories

487
00:16:19.035 --> 00:16:20.559
"with better ones."

488
00:16:20.559 --> 00:16:21.900
<v Voiceover>A good scientist would say that.</v>

489
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.749
<v ->A good scientist would think that way.</v>

490
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:24.562
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->And so Edgar Cayce</v>

491
00:16:24.562 --> 00:16:27.020
actually is the only scientific approach

492
00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.544
to dream interpretation.

493
00:16:28.544 --> 00:16:29.784
Because what I was saying is,

494
00:16:29.784 --> 00:16:31.977
Okay, your dream is gonna correct you.

495
00:16:31.977 --> 00:16:33.969
"If you, you misunderstood what

496
00:16:33.969 --> 00:16:35.045
"it was trying to say.

497
00:16:35.045 --> 00:16:36.834
"It wasn't about running around.

498
00:16:36.834 --> 00:16:38.560
"You know, it was more like

499
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.185
"take off your head, or don't be so."

500
00:16:40.185 --> 00:16:41.324
Who knows?

501
00:16:41.324 --> 00:16:44.778
But if you actually do what you think

502
00:16:44.778 --> 00:16:47.195
it's saying, that's showing sincerity.

503
00:16:47.195 --> 00:16:48.597
That's showing you're actually trying

504
00:16:48.597 --> 00:16:50.059
to do something.

505
00:16:50.059 --> 00:16:51.827
You're not guessing, you know, just saying,

506
00:16:51.827 --> 00:16:54.570
"Well, behind which door is the lady

507
00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:55.850
"and which door is the tiger?"

508
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:57.353
Hypothetically.

509
00:16:57.353 --> 00:17:00.299
You're gonna walk through one of those doors

510
00:17:00.299 --> 00:17:01.924
and so you're making a bet it's this one

511
00:17:01.924 --> 00:17:04.078
and you're starting to walk through that door

512
00:17:04.078 --> 00:17:07.741
daring your dreams to stop you if you're wrong.

513
00:17:07.897 --> 00:17:09.401
And now they have incentive.

514
00:17:09.401 --> 00:17:10.316
(laughing)
You know?

515
00:17:10.316 --> 00:17:11.311
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->Because dreams</v>

516
00:17:11.311 --> 00:17:12.834
don't deal with hypotheticals.

517
00:17:12.834 --> 00:17:14.380
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->Dreams are real.</v>

518
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.451
They're like trying to change the tide.

519
00:17:16.451 --> 00:17:17.529
You know?

520
00:17:17.529 --> 00:17:19.987
Instead you've got to work with the tide.

521
00:17:19.987 --> 00:17:21.694
And know when the tide is up to.

522
00:17:21.694 --> 00:17:23.278
And dreams we know, pretty much

523
00:17:23.278 --> 00:17:24.843
they're kind of like a thermostat.

524
00:17:24.843 --> 00:17:26.406
They're trying to keep you in the

525
00:17:26.406 --> 00:17:27.422
middle of the road

526
00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:29.758
to take you to where you're supposed to go.

527
00:17:29.758 --> 00:17:32.177
So if you start engaging like this.

528
00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:34.432
So what I did then

529
00:17:34.432 --> 00:17:37.506
was I created a work book

530
00:17:38.617 --> 00:17:40.162
where I start out

531
00:17:40.162 --> 00:17:41.766
and I have a person collect dreams

532
00:17:41.766 --> 00:17:43.432
for seven days.

533
00:17:43.432 --> 00:17:45.098
And we're going back to the early '70s

534
00:17:45.098 --> 00:17:46.602
but this is important because of

535
00:17:46.602 --> 00:17:48.755
when we get into the farther out stuff

536
00:17:48.755 --> 00:17:51.335
all of this has a sound basis.

537
00:17:51.335 --> 00:17:53.651
All of this has been a building block.

538
00:17:53.651 --> 00:17:55.439
Block after block after block.

539
00:17:55.439 --> 00:17:57.431
I wasn't aware of this until

540
00:17:57.431 --> 00:17:58.853
people started pointing out to me,

541
00:17:58.853 --> 00:18:01.495
"Henry, your story has continuity.

542
00:18:01.495 --> 00:18:03.586
"From your dream off into these

543
00:18:03.586 --> 00:18:05.659
"revelatory kinds of processes

544
00:18:05.659 --> 00:18:07.629
"that you're involving people with,

545
00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:09.255
"you can go back and you can see

546
00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:10.555
"each little experiment,

547
00:18:10.555 --> 00:18:11.998
"each little thing that led to this,

548
00:18:11.998 --> 00:18:14.091
"that led to that, and so on."

549
00:18:14.091 --> 00:18:16.914
It's also too, part of my secret mission

550
00:18:16.914 --> 00:18:19.983
is to restore Shamanism to the Gringo American.

551
00:18:19.983 --> 00:18:23.009
In a Gringo way, not imitating anybody

552
00:18:23.009 --> 00:18:24.980
like I have a WalMart approach

553
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.113
to Shamanic soul retrieval,

554
00:18:27.113 --> 00:18:28.536
that people at WalMart can do

555
00:18:28.536 --> 00:18:29.917
in a WalMart way.

556
00:18:29.917 --> 00:18:32.193
Rather than putting on Indian feathers

557
00:18:32.193 --> 00:18:33.921
and beads, that's not our way.

558
00:18:33.921 --> 00:18:34.855
You know?

559
00:18:34.855 --> 00:18:37.069
In my past lives as Natives and indigenous

560
00:18:37.069 --> 00:18:39.325
gets insulted and cries for the Gringos

561
00:18:39.325 --> 00:18:41.661
that don't have their own way to the spirit.

562
00:18:41.661 --> 00:18:42.778
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->Everybody deserves</v>

563
00:18:42.778 --> 00:18:45.135
their own way, there's a Gringo way.

564
00:18:45.135 --> 00:18:45.907
You know?

565
00:18:45.907 --> 00:18:47.594
This Gringo is neat.
(laughing)

566
00:18:47.594 --> 00:18:48.670
You know?

567
00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.459
So I'm trying to bring that.

568
00:18:50.459 --> 00:18:51.656
You know, I wasn't aware of it,

569
00:18:51.656 --> 00:18:53.058
at the time, but that's definitely

570
00:18:53.058 --> 00:18:54.724
what I'm doing, is showing people

571
00:18:54.724 --> 00:18:56.898
in their ordinary stuff, the roots

572
00:18:56.898 --> 00:18:58.767
of Gringo Shamanism.

573
00:18:58.767 --> 00:19:00.332
That we can do too, you know?

574
00:19:00.332 --> 00:19:01.064
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->And our tea</v>

575
00:19:01.064 --> 00:19:02.568
parties, and our coffee clatches,

576
00:19:02.568 --> 00:19:04.660
(mumbling), and so on.

577
00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.406
But anyway, back to the story.

578
00:19:06.406 --> 00:19:07.626
So where are we at?

579
00:19:07.626 --> 00:19:09.210
<v Voiceover>Oh, so you had everybody</v>

580
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.629
gather their dreams for seven days.

581
00:19:11.629 --> 00:19:12.503
<v ->Yes, right.</v>

582
00:19:12.503 --> 00:19:14.067
They would gather their dreams for seven.

583
00:19:14.067 --> 00:19:15.651
See, this book is still in use.

584
00:19:15.651 --> 00:19:17.521
This is what now, '74,

585
00:19:17.521 --> 00:19:18.820
it was first written.

586
00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.223
And to demonstrate is something that's

587
00:19:20.223 --> 00:19:23.107
never been, anybody else ever demonstrated it.

588
00:19:23.107 --> 00:19:25.200
With hundreds and hundreds of people.

589
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.216
That people could do it,

590
00:19:26.216 --> 00:19:28.085
what I'm showing you is the model.

591
00:19:28.085 --> 00:19:29.222
What was the means by which

592
00:19:29.222 --> 00:19:31.274
people demonstrated that they could

593
00:19:31.274 --> 00:19:32.798
use their dreams on their own,

594
00:19:32.798 --> 00:19:35.135
and make progress.

595
00:19:35.135 --> 00:19:36.516
That led them to the journals,

596
00:19:36.516 --> 00:19:37.857
that led to the dream work movement,

597
00:19:37.857 --> 00:19:39.747
led to the dream helpers ceremony,

598
00:19:39.747 --> 00:19:41.311
that led to the intuitive heart

599
00:19:41.311 --> 00:19:42.875
and the valid enlightment training.

600
00:19:42.875 --> 00:19:45.354
It's all step by step by step.

601
00:19:45.354 --> 00:19:47.041
But with collaborative work,

602
00:19:47.041 --> 00:19:48.727
you know, of the people.

603
00:19:48.727 --> 00:19:50.027
Of the people themselves.

604
00:19:50.027 --> 00:19:51.063
<v Voiceover>And you're, that's the thing</v>

605
00:19:51.063 --> 00:19:52.567
the thing that runs through all of it.

606
00:19:52.567 --> 00:19:53.664
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>Is you're</v>

607
00:19:53.664 --> 00:19:55.492
saying, "Don't let experts tell you who you are."

608
00:19:55.492 --> 00:19:56.305
<v ->Right.
<v Voiceover>"What you</v>

609
00:19:56.305 --> 00:19:57.707
"think, what your dreams are."

610
00:19:57.707 --> 00:19:58.479
<v ->Exactly.
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

611
00:19:58.479 --> 00:20:00.307
<v ->I'm trying to create, what I call</v>

612
00:20:00.307 --> 00:20:01.324
the (mumbling) circle.

613
00:20:01.324 --> 00:20:02.664
In other words, ways in which group

614
00:20:02.664 --> 00:20:04.291
of people can get together

615
00:20:04.291 --> 00:20:07.805
with no special expertise amongst themselves

616
00:20:07.805 --> 00:20:11.569
and channel, as in bring together,

617
00:20:12.011 --> 00:20:14.632
products, new ways of doing things,

618
00:20:14.632 --> 00:20:17.619
new ways of being, solving problems,

619
00:20:17.619 --> 00:20:18.552
and so on.

620
00:20:18.552 --> 00:20:21.417
And one of my dreams suggesting even that

621
00:20:21.417 --> 00:20:24.099
we come to a point where in consciousness

622
00:20:24.099 --> 00:20:27.553
together we can start simulating photosynthesis,

623
00:20:27.553 --> 00:20:29.605
which we may have to do.

624
00:20:29.605 --> 00:20:31.414
We may have to be able to draw our energy

625
00:20:31.414 --> 00:20:33.973
directly from the sun because the planet

626
00:20:33.973 --> 00:20:35.720
and such will not be able to sit

627
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.808
in photosynthesis, and we need it to live.

628
00:20:38.808 --> 00:20:40.169
But my dreams telling us in the right

629
00:20:40.169 --> 00:20:41.877
state of consciousness, the group of people

630
00:20:41.877 --> 00:20:42.974
can do that.

631
00:20:42.974 --> 00:20:44.456
That's still a ways off,

632
00:20:44.456 --> 00:20:46.447
and I don't want to get too.

633
00:20:46.447 --> 00:20:47.424
(crosstalk)

634
00:20:47.424 --> 00:20:48.338
<v Voiceover>And I have seen that</v>

635
00:20:48.338 --> 00:20:49.191
in similar states.

636
00:20:49.191 --> 00:20:50.694
<v ->Show you that the solid base</v>

637
00:20:50.694 --> 00:20:54.032
that this is working with, constantly.

638
00:20:54.493 --> 00:20:56.667
It's not that there's not expertise involved.

639
00:20:56.667 --> 00:20:58.150
I've had a lot of education.

640
00:20:58.150 --> 00:20:59.592
I've had a lot of training.

641
00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:01.624
Then, you know, through the psychoanalysis

642
00:21:01.624 --> 00:21:04.387
training, and the regular scientific work,

643
00:21:04.387 --> 00:21:06.542
and then my own studies, and so on,

644
00:21:06.542 --> 00:21:07.659
to produce this.

645
00:21:07.659 --> 00:21:10.727
But it's all meant as a gift for the people.

646
00:21:10.727 --> 00:21:13.307
And when we get to the dream helper ceremony

647
00:21:13.307 --> 00:21:15.358
I can show you that it doesn't even take any

648
00:21:15.358 --> 00:21:17.390
training to do it, it just needs

649
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.219
the balls to go off and do it.

650
00:21:19.219 --> 00:21:21.251
<v Voiceover>Okay, so here you are.</v>

651
00:21:21.251 --> 00:21:23.385
And you've been living outside of the box

652
00:21:23.385 --> 00:21:24.704
pretty much your whole life,

653
00:21:24.704 --> 00:21:25.498
it sounds like.
<v ->What's that?</v>

654
00:21:25.498 --> 00:21:27.041
<v Voiceover>You've been living outside the box</v>

655
00:21:27.041 --> 00:21:28.869
almost your whole life in your thinking,

656
00:21:28.869 --> 00:21:29.785
it sounds like.
<v ->And it's hard</v>

657
00:21:29.785 --> 00:21:30.698
to do that.
<v Voiceover>It is hard.</v>

658
00:21:30.698 --> 00:21:32.222
<v ->It is.
<v Voiceover>It is.</v>

659
00:21:32.222 --> 00:21:33.217
<v ->And people don't understand</v>

660
00:21:33.217 --> 00:21:34.558
what you're doing.

661
00:21:34.558 --> 00:21:37.708
They interpret it in terms of the old ways.

662
00:21:37.708 --> 00:21:38.825
<v Voiceover>But then you get names like</v>

663
00:21:38.825 --> 00:21:40.653
"the father of."

664
00:21:40.653 --> 00:21:41.608
Because you were.
<v Voiceover>I was</v>

665
00:21:41.608 --> 00:21:42.950
really surprised by that.
(laughing)

666
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.042
That came out in a book later.

667
00:21:45.842 --> 00:21:47.499
And it still doesn't make sense

668
00:21:47.499 --> 00:21:49.651
unless I were to finish the story.

669
00:21:49.651 --> 00:21:52.009
But we had for the people were these

670
00:21:52.009 --> 00:21:54.263
work books to then

671
00:21:54.263 --> 00:21:55.910
look in their dreams

672
00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:57.900
to let their dreams decide on something

673
00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.523
that they would go and try to improve upon.

674
00:22:00.523 --> 00:22:02.290
And then they would collect dreams

675
00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:03.407
for seven days.

676
00:22:03.407 --> 00:22:04.748
I gave them some very simple,

677
00:22:04.748 --> 00:22:07.144
we just made up exercises to help them

678
00:22:07.144 --> 00:22:09.319
come up with some idea from their dream

679
00:22:09.319 --> 00:22:11.775
as to what it might be saying about their subject.

680
00:22:11.775 --> 00:22:12.953
And then go try it

681
00:22:12.953 --> 00:22:14.436
and see what other dreams came.

682
00:22:14.436 --> 00:22:16.123
Then we get back to all this mail,

683
00:22:16.123 --> 00:22:17.790
all this letters of stories

684
00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:19.475
of people who've changed their life,

685
00:22:19.475 --> 00:22:20.978
who've overcome habits,

686
00:22:20.978 --> 00:22:23.051
who develop new things, relationships,

687
00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:25.084
and so on, and get them to write up articles

688
00:22:25.084 --> 00:22:27.135
and magazines about them.

689
00:22:27.135 --> 00:22:28.293
And some of them are dreaming that

690
00:22:28.293 --> 00:22:30.060
this has to continue.

691
00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.154
We had then a dream for America,

692
00:22:32.154 --> 00:22:34.354
1976.

693
00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:36.014
We had people dream for America.

694
00:22:36.014 --> 00:22:38.371
It was amazing, those dreams were so

695
00:22:38.371 --> 00:22:40.198
prophetic of today.

696
00:22:40.198 --> 00:22:41.966
<v Voiceover>What, give me an example, or two.</v>

697
00:22:41.966 --> 00:22:43.166
I want to hear that.

698
00:22:43.166 --> 00:22:44.404
<v ->Those are scary dreams.
<v Voiceover>Okay, tell me.</v>

699
00:22:44.404 --> 00:22:45.360
<v ->Scary dreams.</v>

700
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.964
And they're online.

701
00:22:46.964 --> 00:22:49.910
From the fascist coming into America,

702
00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:51.657
where we're losing all of our freedoms

703
00:22:51.657 --> 00:22:54.955
because we're scared, and we're just like sheep.

704
00:22:55.396 --> 00:22:58.138
And that really, it gets some of us riled up

705
00:22:58.138 --> 00:22:59.459
because, wake up folks,

706
00:22:59.459 --> 00:23:01.003
don't be a sheep!
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

707
00:23:01.003 --> 00:23:02.364
<v ->We're getting screwed here.</v>

708
00:23:02.364 --> 00:23:03.522
<v Voiceover>Right, so that was coming up</v>

709
00:23:03.522 --> 00:23:05.372
almost 40 years ago.

710
00:23:05.372 --> 00:23:07.098
<v ->Yeah yeah yeah.</v>

711
00:23:07.098 --> 00:23:09.699
And also the role of UFOs

712
00:23:09.699 --> 00:23:12.239
as a new consciousness

713
00:23:12.239 --> 00:23:14.697
to help us, and this is this thing about

714
00:23:14.697 --> 00:23:17.400
there's one dream, I'll tell you one dream.

715
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.142
That I think is just so, it's very sad

716
00:23:20.142 --> 00:23:22.987
and scary, but, and very touching.

717
00:23:22.987 --> 00:23:25.452
Because of what it suggests.

718
00:23:26.827 --> 00:23:28.473
There's a crowd of people.

719
00:23:28.473 --> 00:23:30.158
I look up and the sun, something's going

720
00:23:30.158 --> 00:23:31.844
on with the sun.

721
00:23:31.844 --> 00:23:34.527
That's always, I tell you, this is a special dream.

722
00:23:34.527 --> 00:23:36.862
Out of the sun a UF, a flying saucer

723
00:23:36.862 --> 00:23:38.447
is coming down.

724
00:23:38.447 --> 00:23:39.423
It's coming down.

725
00:23:39.423 --> 00:23:40.418
The people are looking at it,

726
00:23:40.418 --> 00:23:41.373
"A flying saucer!"

727
00:23:41.373 --> 00:23:42.876
And then they can look.

728
00:23:42.876 --> 00:23:45.396
"We can see the captain in the flying saucer!

729
00:23:45.396 --> 00:23:47.305
"It's a woman!"
(laughing)

730
00:23:47.305 --> 00:23:49.195
They're all, they can't believe it,

731
00:23:49.195 --> 00:23:50.597
it's a woman!

732
00:23:50.597 --> 00:23:52.303
Flying the saucer!

733
00:23:52.303 --> 00:23:53.301
And then just ask them,

734
00:23:53.301 --> 00:23:54.477
they're more amazed that it's

735
00:23:54.477 --> 00:23:57.302
a woman flying than it is a flying saucer.

736
00:23:57.302 --> 00:23:58.053
(laughing)
And the thing

737
00:23:58.053 --> 00:23:59.557
comes down,

738
00:23:59.557 --> 00:24:01.629
and the woman comes out.

739
00:24:01.629 --> 00:24:03.153
And she comes to the people

740
00:24:03.153 --> 00:24:04.820
and they're all expecting,

741
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:06.911
lady what is she offering us?

742
00:24:06.911 --> 00:24:09.492
And she comes and she offers us a plant.

743
00:24:09.492 --> 00:24:11.076
A little plant.

744
00:24:11.566 --> 00:24:15.268
And I realize that's the renewal of photosynthesis.

745
00:24:15.526 --> 00:24:17.010
On the planet.
<v Voiceover>Oh goodness.</v>

746
00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:18.431
<v ->After it's not possible anymore.</v>

747
00:24:18.431 --> 00:24:20.056
<v Voiceover>The movie "Wall-E."</v>

748
00:24:20.056 --> 00:24:21.316
<v ->I've never seen that, oh yeah.</v>

749
00:24:21.316 --> 00:24:22.373
<v Voiceover>Little plant.</v>
<v ->Oh, okay.</v>

750
00:24:22.373 --> 00:24:23.268
<v Voiceover>Ah, that's all that's left,</v>

751
00:24:23.268 --> 00:24:24.222
one little plant.
(crosstalk)

752
00:24:24.222 --> 00:24:26.700
<v ->And that said a lot of things to me.</v>

753
00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.809
One, we really need to be

754
00:24:29.809 --> 00:24:31.537
contrary to the Republicans that are

755
00:24:31.537 --> 00:24:33.709
passing all these laws that say,

756
00:24:33.709 --> 00:24:35.355
"We own women's vaginas

757
00:24:35.355 --> 00:24:36.677
"and we're gonna tell them what to do

758
00:24:36.677 --> 00:24:37.692
"with them."

759
00:24:37.692 --> 00:24:39.886
In contrary to that, this is saying

760
00:24:39.886 --> 00:24:41.978
the new thing, the respect for the feminine

761
00:24:41.978 --> 00:24:43.157
is what's going to save us.

762
00:24:43.157 --> 00:24:44.580
It's going to provide

763
00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.306
what we're going to need.

764
00:24:46.306 --> 00:24:49.333
UFO, or science, and I have a lot of dreams

765
00:24:49.333 --> 00:24:50.309
about that.

766
00:24:50.309 --> 00:24:51.061
That, to me,

767
00:24:51.061 --> 00:24:52.543
not that there might be machines flying

768
00:24:52.543 --> 00:24:54.251
around, but in terms of the evolution of

769
00:24:54.251 --> 00:24:56.526
our consciousness, my dream.

770
00:24:56.526 --> 00:24:58.862
Well, I'll tell you a series of dreams very quickly.

771
00:24:58.862 --> 00:25:00.955
We were doing this dance, I haven't even told you

772
00:25:00.955 --> 00:25:03.779
about my dream of the dance, the (mumbling) circle.

773
00:25:03.779 --> 00:25:05.709
But we're doing it, and all of a sudden we

774
00:25:05.709 --> 00:25:09.027
take off, and we become a flying saucer.

775
00:25:09.226 --> 00:25:11.195
And this is incredible because

776
00:25:11.195 --> 00:25:13.227
we get exposed to consciousness

777
00:25:13.227 --> 00:25:14.994
that we're not used to.

778
00:25:14.994 --> 00:25:16.829
This is huge.

779
00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.464
It's kind of like, I can know

780
00:25:19.464 --> 00:25:20.703
everybody's thoughts, I'm okay

781
00:25:20.703 --> 00:25:23.445
obviously, like a salad or a symphony.

782
00:25:23.445 --> 00:25:25.768
And yet as a group thing it's just

783
00:25:25.768 --> 00:25:28.363
making this new, it's just way bigger.

784
00:25:28.363 --> 00:25:31.187
And we land, we come back and we land,

785
00:25:31.187 --> 00:25:33.652
and we realize, we never left.

786
00:25:33.788 --> 00:25:36.185
No we weren't in a flying saucer.

787
00:25:36.185 --> 00:25:39.212
That the flying saucers how we symbolize

788
00:25:39.212 --> 00:25:41.244
to ourselves this new consciousness

789
00:25:41.244 --> 00:25:42.849
that's coming.

790
00:25:42.849 --> 00:25:45.497
And that was in the dream.

791
00:25:48.335 --> 00:25:49.574
So anyway,

792
00:25:49.574 --> 00:25:50.915
I don't know where we are in terms of

793
00:25:50.915 --> 00:25:52.343
the story.
<v Voiceover>Well we can.</v>

794
00:25:52.343 --> 00:25:53.724
You've done the dreams

795
00:25:53.724 --> 00:25:55.771
that all started flooding back.

796
00:25:55.771 --> 00:25:57.742
You started seeing a continuity

797
00:25:57.742 --> 00:26:00.037
to certain stories, like this photosynthesis

798
00:26:00.037 --> 00:26:02.028
idea, the fascism, and so forth.

799
00:26:02.028 --> 00:26:03.471
<v ->This is after we started the journal.</v>

800
00:26:03.471 --> 00:26:04.345
<v Voiceover>The journal, uh huh.</v>

801
00:26:04.345 --> 00:26:06.275
<v ->So we did the project with the ARE,</v>

802
00:26:06.275 --> 00:26:08.286
and I saw A, people can use their

803
00:26:08.286 --> 00:26:09.952
dreams constructively.

804
00:26:09.952 --> 00:26:12.471
And B, many of them are talking about

805
00:26:12.471 --> 00:26:14.300
what would be in their dreams, and so on,

806
00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.393
what would it be like if the public knew

807
00:26:16.393 --> 00:26:18.993
about what we were dreaming about?

808
00:26:18.993 --> 00:26:21.594
What would it be like if there was

809
00:26:21.594 --> 00:26:23.585
dreams on the morning news?

810
00:26:23.585 --> 00:26:25.880
<v Voiceover>I'm with you, I mean, just</v>

811
00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.374
talking with friends you'll

812
00:26:27.374 --> 00:26:28.277
see you're dreaming in tandem.

813
00:26:28.277 --> 00:26:29.130
<v ->Exactly.</v>

814
00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:29.984
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->So I said,</v>

815
00:26:29.984 --> 00:26:31.101
"Okay, I'm gonna start a journal."

816
00:26:31.101 --> 00:26:32.219
And I'd already had dreams.

817
00:26:32.219 --> 00:26:35.455
I had a dream where I get,

818
00:26:35.896 --> 00:26:38.131
it comes to me at the Princeton

819
00:26:38.131 --> 00:26:41.056
faculty mail box, a letter addressed

820
00:26:41.056 --> 00:26:43.596
to Henry Reed at Sundance College.

821
00:26:43.596 --> 00:26:45.165
And I went, "How did this letter addressed

822
00:26:45.165 --> 00:26:47.253
"to me so wrong get here?"

823
00:26:47.253 --> 00:26:48.147
You know?

824
00:26:48.147 --> 00:26:48.939
And the question is,

825
00:26:48.939 --> 00:26:50.301
How did the knowledge of this

826
00:26:50.301 --> 00:26:53.420
architype of a (mumbling) circle

827
00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.361
reach me in my academic studies?

828
00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.326
Because I have now been gifted

829
00:26:58.326 --> 00:26:59.870
with this, and it's true.

830
00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:02.186
And so, and that's a whole other story

831
00:27:02.186 --> 00:27:03.974
I don't want to get into publicly,

832
00:27:03.974 --> 00:27:06.624
as the internal,

833
00:27:07.677 --> 00:27:08.975
how would you say,

834
00:27:08.975 --> 00:27:10.661
attaboys from the other side

835
00:27:10.661 --> 00:27:12.815
that I'm okay to use some of these words

836
00:27:12.815 --> 00:27:16.127
that are associated with various indigenous

837
00:27:16.127 --> 00:27:19.114
people because I have carried the medicine

838
00:27:19.114 --> 00:27:20.677
of that.
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

839
00:27:20.677 --> 00:27:22.668
<v ->And the Sundance, so we named them</v>

840
00:27:22.668 --> 00:27:24.944
The Sundance Community Dream Journal.

841
00:27:24.944 --> 00:27:26.000
<v Voiceover>From your dream, yeah.</v>

842
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:26.936
<v ->From my dream.
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

843
00:27:26.936 --> 00:27:29.312
<v ->And because the purpose was the same.</v>

844
00:27:29.312 --> 00:27:30.937
Because when the Indians came up

845
00:27:30.937 --> 00:27:33.235
with the Sundance, it was from

846
00:27:33.235 --> 00:27:34.981
their dreams, it was like a group dream.

847
00:27:34.981 --> 00:27:36.057
Vision, really.

848
00:27:36.057 --> 00:27:39.248
Incubation for their survival under threat.

849
00:27:39.248 --> 00:27:41.414
And also for the, how would you say,

850
00:27:41.414 --> 00:27:43.993
the flowering and continuation,

851
00:27:43.993 --> 00:27:46.519
and growth of their culture.

852
00:27:46.879 --> 00:27:49.540
See it got into the those stance later

853
00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:51.105
when they're really under a threat.

854
00:27:51.105 --> 00:27:53.014
But we before that in the Plains Indians

855
00:27:53.014 --> 00:27:56.520
spirituality that was a part of their renewal.

856
00:27:56.975 --> 00:27:58.763
The game, where should we live,

857
00:27:58.763 --> 00:28:00.064
where should we get our food

858
00:28:00.064 --> 00:28:01.750
next year, where should we do our dances?

859
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:02.766
<v Voiceover>To do collective dreaming</v>

860
00:28:02.766 --> 00:28:03.822
to get their answers.

861
00:28:03.822 --> 00:28:04.615
<v ->Exactly.</v>

862
00:28:04.615 --> 00:28:06.626
So I used that as the name of the journal

863
00:28:06.626 --> 00:28:08.170
and started collecting from people who

864
00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:10.364
are non-professionals, little articles

865
00:28:10.364 --> 00:28:12.335
about what they were doing with their dreams

866
00:28:12.335 --> 00:28:14.123
so other people could see.

867
00:28:14.123 --> 00:28:17.578
And the weirdest thing was, we started.

868
00:28:18.848 --> 00:28:20.949
I sent out a subscription notice,

869
00:28:20.949 --> 00:28:22.555
like magazines do, and I said,

870
00:28:22.555 --> 00:28:24.342
"You cannot decide if you're

871
00:28:24.342 --> 00:28:26.029
"gonna subscribe to our magazine.

872
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:28.203
"You must put this under your pillow

873
00:28:28.203 --> 00:28:30.336
"and see what dream you get.

874
00:28:30.336 --> 00:28:32.550
"And what will be the impact on you

875
00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.806
"if you subscribe to our journal."

876
00:28:34.806 --> 00:28:35.984
Really, we did that!

877
00:28:35.984 --> 00:28:36.736
<v Voiceover>And?</v>
<v ->And that's what</v>

878
00:28:36.736 --> 00:28:38.402
gained the first dreams.

879
00:28:38.402 --> 00:28:39.438
When people subscribed

880
00:28:39.438 --> 00:28:41.409
we put all those dreams in the journal.

881
00:28:41.409 --> 00:28:43.603
And the dreams were incredible.

882
00:28:43.603 --> 00:28:45.838
This one gave a profound impact

883
00:28:45.838 --> 00:28:49.007
on society if we had a "People" magazine

884
00:28:49.007 --> 00:28:51.431
that was people's dreams.

885
00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.213
So we got through six issues

886
00:28:53.213 --> 00:28:55.285
and those places that really geared

887
00:28:55.285 --> 00:28:56.748
to be successful in that way,

888
00:28:56.748 --> 00:28:57.926
and we just stopped.

889
00:28:57.926 --> 00:28:59.227
But I made a point.

890
00:28:59.227 --> 00:29:00.344
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

891
00:29:00.344 --> 00:29:01.502
<v ->And when I quit,</v>

892
00:29:01.502 --> 00:29:03.026
then they wanted it to continue.

893
00:29:03.026 --> 00:29:04.469
So some other people came along

894
00:29:04.469 --> 00:29:06.846
and they started Dream Network Journal,

895
00:29:06.846 --> 00:29:08.207
or Dream Network Bulletin,

896
00:29:08.207 --> 00:29:09.853
and that's still going on.

897
00:29:09.853 --> 00:29:11.295
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>
<v ->Okay.</v>

898
00:29:11.295 --> 00:29:14.322
Then The Association for the Study of Dreams

899
00:29:14.322 --> 00:29:17.310
got started some time in the late '70s,

900
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:19.239
early '80s, and they credited the

901
00:29:19.239 --> 00:29:21.149
Sundance Journals with being a big

902
00:29:21.149 --> 00:29:22.693
impotence for that.

903
00:29:22.693 --> 00:29:24.521
And a lot of the people that started

904
00:29:24.521 --> 00:29:27.013
The Association for the Study of Dreams

905
00:29:27.013 --> 00:29:30.785
had written in something in the Sundance Journals.

906
00:29:31.185 --> 00:29:33.684
And this was showing, not only

907
00:29:33.684 --> 00:29:35.107
that people can use their dreams,

908
00:29:35.107 --> 00:29:36.996
but there's a major social impact

909
00:29:36.996 --> 00:29:40.226
of dream sharing in some big way.

910
00:29:40.226 --> 00:29:43.011
And that hasn't continued in a big way.

911
00:29:43.011 --> 00:29:45.814
Now there's a place called Dream Cloud

912
00:29:45.814 --> 00:29:47.683
that's put something on the web

913
00:29:47.683 --> 00:29:49.044
where they're looking for dreams

914
00:29:49.044 --> 00:29:50.769
and you can post your dreams.

915
00:29:50.769 --> 00:29:52.110
I'd offered them to donate my

916
00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:54.670
whole dream journal anonymously to them.

917
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:56.051
That they could have that on there

918
00:29:56.051 --> 00:29:57.047
and other peoples.

919
00:29:57.047 --> 00:29:58.246
So you could see what the whole world

920
00:29:58.246 --> 00:29:59.851
is dreaming about on a given day.

921
00:29:59.851 --> 00:30:00.927
<v Voiceover>That's fascinating.</v>

922
00:30:00.927 --> 00:30:02.289
<v ->You can tune in and you can see what</v>

923
00:30:02.289 --> 00:30:04.178
was the most frequently used word

924
00:30:04.178 --> 00:30:05.600
in dream records last night,

925
00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.099
of the people who were contributing, and so on.

926
00:30:08.099 --> 00:30:09.237
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

927
00:30:09.237 --> 00:30:10.578
Ah, so now and,

928
00:30:10.578 --> 00:30:12.955
isn't the Arlington Institute--

929
00:30:12.955 --> 00:30:13.706
<v ->No, uh uh.
<v Voiceover>doing any</v>

930
00:30:13.706 --> 00:30:14.661
of that?
<v ->No no no.</v>

931
00:30:14.661 --> 00:30:15.779
<v Voiceover>That's not what they're doing.</v>

932
00:30:15.779 --> 00:30:16.998
<v ->No no no no no no.</v>

933
00:30:16.998 --> 00:30:17.831
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

934
00:30:17.831 --> 00:30:18.623
So--
<v ->Arlington Institute,</v>

935
00:30:18.623 --> 00:30:20.960
he and I, we have had our interconnections.

936
00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.951
Let me belong to one of the dream theme.

937
00:30:22.951 --> 00:30:23.438
<v Voiceover>Please, yes.</v>

938
00:30:23.438 --> 00:30:26.472
<v ->Because this is, to me, this,</v>

939
00:30:26.709 --> 00:30:28.071
what I want to describe now

940
00:30:28.071 --> 00:30:30.304
probably maximizes bringing the

941
00:30:30.304 --> 00:30:32.092
most far out potential

942
00:30:32.092 --> 00:30:34.855
with the most easy, doable means.

943
00:30:34.855 --> 00:30:35.729
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>
<v ->Okay?</v>

944
00:30:35.729 --> 00:30:37.480
<v Voiceover>You like that.</v>

945
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.262
<v ->Because of the dreams that I had</v>

946
00:30:40.262 --> 00:30:42.231
and being invited to come and work with

947
00:30:42.231 --> 00:30:44.100
ARE and we had tried the thing

948
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.319
with the journals.

949
00:30:45.319 --> 00:30:47.086
Well, that was based, the journal work,

950
00:30:47.086 --> 00:30:49.606
was based on another dream that I had

951
00:30:49.606 --> 00:30:51.401
using a tent.

952
00:30:51.556 --> 00:30:53.852
And I put a tent up at ARE camp.

953
00:30:53.852 --> 00:30:55.660
And I did a special ceremony

954
00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.504
to get the place all sacred and everything.

955
00:30:58.504 --> 00:31:00.536
And then I told the kids,

956
00:31:00.536 --> 00:31:02.548
that this tent is a sacred tent now.

957
00:31:02.548 --> 00:31:04.315
And you can come here and sleep,

958
00:31:04.315 --> 00:31:06.164
and have a dream to heal yourself

959
00:31:06.164 --> 00:31:07.444
of whatever.

960
00:31:07.444 --> 00:31:09.272
But you have to be invited by a dream

961
00:31:09.272 --> 00:31:10.146
to do that.

962
00:31:10.146 --> 00:31:12.198
So I'm telling you first, it's there.

963
00:31:12.198 --> 00:31:13.295
So now you wait.

964
00:31:13.295 --> 00:31:14.331
So they would have,

965
00:31:14.331 --> 00:31:15.388
some would have a dream.

966
00:31:15.388 --> 00:31:18.604
and I had a process that I put them through.

967
00:31:18.604 --> 00:31:21.056
And they would sleep in the tent

968
00:31:21.056 --> 00:31:23.758
to have these incredible dreams.

969
00:31:23.758 --> 00:31:26.771
And when that was done

970
00:31:26.968 --> 00:31:28.755
I wrote the article for

971
00:31:28.755 --> 00:31:30.665
The Journal of Humanistic Psychology

972
00:31:30.665 --> 00:31:34.302
1970 the Princeton University faculty read it

973
00:31:34.302 --> 00:31:36.417
and I was immediately fired

974
00:31:36.417 --> 00:31:39.666
because I introduced prayer into the experiments.

975
00:31:39.666 --> 00:31:42.012
Because I had said that

976
00:31:42.012 --> 00:31:44.257
all the dream research that's being done now,

977
00:31:44.257 --> 00:31:45.436
you look at the dreamer

978
00:31:45.436 --> 00:31:47.081
like a chicken and an egg factory.

979
00:31:47.081 --> 00:31:47.996
And you do this to them,

980
00:31:47.996 --> 00:31:48.849
and you do that to them

981
00:31:48.849 --> 00:31:51.003
and you see what dream pops out.

982
00:31:51.003 --> 00:31:52.770
What I'm doing is I'm dialoguing

983
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:54.010
with the person.

984
00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:55.229
I'm asking them, you know,

985
00:31:55.229 --> 00:31:56.752
what's important to you

986
00:31:56.752 --> 00:31:59.251
that you can call upon the dream land,

987
00:31:59.251 --> 00:32:00.633
or whatever to help you.

988
00:32:00.633 --> 00:32:03.172
Just like indigenous people would do.

989
00:32:03.172 --> 00:32:04.940
And of course we're gonna have prayer,

990
00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.870
and what's wrong with that?

991
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:09.471
You know, I'm not studying the power

992
00:32:09.471 --> 00:32:12.234
of prayer, I am bringing in all the factors

993
00:32:12.234 --> 00:32:14.855
that could help get the man on the moon.

994
00:32:14.855 --> 00:32:16.196
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->You know?</v>

995
00:32:16.196 --> 00:32:17.252
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

996
00:32:17.252 --> 00:32:18.837
<v ->This is not a study of prayer,</v>

997
00:32:18.837 --> 00:32:20.239
this is just using prayer.

998
00:32:20.239 --> 00:32:21.620
And I use art work,

999
00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:22.636
I have them draw pictures,

1000
00:32:22.636 --> 00:32:23.591
I talk with them,

1001
00:32:23.591 --> 00:32:24.851
I do all that I can.

1002
00:32:24.851 --> 00:32:25.846
As one (mumbling) said,

1003
00:32:25.846 --> 00:32:27.411
"Yeah, it's very suggestive."

1004
00:32:27.411 --> 00:32:29.828
"Okay, yeah, it is somewhat suggestive,

1005
00:32:29.828 --> 00:32:31.840
"but yet if they meet God in a dream

1006
00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.917
"and it changes their life,

1007
00:32:32.917 --> 00:32:34.197
"they're not gonna care what you say

1008
00:32:34.197 --> 00:32:35.395
"that if it's suggestive.

1009
00:32:35.395 --> 00:32:36.370
"They don't give a shit."

1010
00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:37.163
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1011
00:32:37.163 --> 00:32:38.347
<v ->"Because they've changed</v>

1012
00:32:38.347 --> 00:32:39.601
"and they don't care about your interpretation."

1013
00:32:39.601 --> 00:32:40.982
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->Okay.</v>

1014
00:32:40.982 --> 00:32:43.481
And the context of doing that.

1015
00:32:43.481 --> 00:32:46.102
The editor of Journal of Humanistic Psychology,

1016
00:32:46.102 --> 00:32:47.890
he talks about contrasts.

1017
00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:49.048
He accepted that paper

1018
00:32:49.048 --> 00:32:50.308
without any changes,

1019
00:32:50.308 --> 00:32:53.457
that was published exactly as I wrote it.

1020
00:32:53.457 --> 00:32:55.773
In 1970, it came out in 1974.

1021
00:32:55.773 --> 00:32:58.827
Princeton immediately fired me about it.

1022
00:32:59.369 --> 00:33:01.096
But at the end of the thing

1023
00:33:01.096 --> 00:33:03.270
I give out a little hint about something.

1024
00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:05.322
While I'm at camp

1025
00:33:05.322 --> 00:33:07.496
the kids come up to me and they're

1026
00:33:07.496 --> 00:33:08.715
telling me their dreams, because

1027
00:33:08.715 --> 00:33:10.747
they know I'm Dream Man.

1028
00:33:10.747 --> 00:33:12.352
And I start noticing the dreams

1029
00:33:12.352 --> 00:33:14.546
they're telling me are very much related

1030
00:33:14.546 --> 00:33:16.801
to the dream the kid had in the tent.

1031
00:33:16.801 --> 00:33:18.508
Nobody's supposed to know what he was up to

1032
00:33:18.508 --> 00:33:20.682
because it's private.

1033
00:33:20.682 --> 00:33:22.734
But this camp is so supportive,

1034
00:33:22.734 --> 00:33:23.912
you know, everybody's for everybody,

1035
00:33:23.912 --> 00:33:25.781
giving back rubs and meditating together.

1036
00:33:25.781 --> 00:33:27.712
The kids care about him.

1037
00:33:27.712 --> 00:33:30.270
And so I said, "A-ha!

1038
00:33:30.515 --> 00:33:33.827
"We have now the naturalistic context

1039
00:33:33.827 --> 00:33:37.267
"for ESP in its natural setting."

1040
00:33:38.744 --> 00:33:41.222
Charles Thomas Cayce had in-doctored me

1041
00:33:41.222 --> 00:33:42.624
a lot when I first came here

1042
00:33:42.624 --> 00:33:44.311
about the pair of psychologists

1043
00:33:44.311 --> 00:33:45.611
who had come to Edgar Cayce

1044
00:33:45.611 --> 00:33:47.642
and said, "If you're so psychic,

1045
00:33:47.642 --> 00:33:50.290
"how come we can't do ESP in our labs?"

1046
00:33:50.568 --> 00:33:51.929
And his answer was basically,

1047
00:33:51.929 --> 00:33:52.803
"Because you take away all the

1048
00:33:52.803 --> 00:33:54.936
"reason for being psychic in the lab."

1049
00:33:54.936 --> 00:33:56.988
You just remove it.

1050
00:33:56.988 --> 00:33:59.142
In trying to be so scientific

1051
00:33:59.142 --> 00:34:01.072
you take away all the stuff,

1052
00:34:01.072 --> 00:34:04.181
and all the reasons why there would be it.

1053
00:34:04.181 --> 00:34:07.066
What you need to do is you create a situation

1054
00:34:07.066 --> 00:34:08.610
where one person really wants

1055
00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:09.991
to connect with another.

1056
00:34:09.991 --> 00:34:11.576
But they have no way of doing it,

1057
00:34:11.576 --> 00:34:13.390
except psychically.

1058
00:34:14.563 --> 00:34:16.716
And I realized that's what we had at camp.

1059
00:34:16.716 --> 00:34:18.118
These kids were darn curious

1060
00:34:18.118 --> 00:34:19.195
about that kid in the tent.

1061
00:34:19.195 --> 00:34:20.454
"What's he up to?

1062
00:34:20.454 --> 00:34:22.202
"What's going on in there?"

1063
00:34:22.202 --> 00:34:24.396
You know and support, so of course.

1064
00:34:24.396 --> 00:34:27.098
So I was talking to my friend Bob (mumbling)

1065
00:34:27.098 --> 00:34:30.186
a professor at the medical school of UVA.

1066
00:34:30.186 --> 00:34:33.701
He was in a series of famous experiments

1067
00:34:33.701 --> 00:34:37.344
called the (mumbling) experiments,

1068
00:34:37.344 --> 00:34:38.841
Dream Telepathy.

1069
00:34:38.841 --> 00:34:40.528
And he was often the dreamer.

1070
00:34:40.528 --> 00:34:42.214
He wasn't the psychologist running

1071
00:34:42.214 --> 00:34:44.327
the experiment, he was a subject.

1072
00:34:44.327 --> 00:34:45.546
Because for some reason

1073
00:34:45.546 --> 00:34:47.293
they found out he was a really good

1074
00:34:47.293 --> 00:34:48.756
psychic dreamer.

1075
00:34:48.756 --> 00:34:50.503
And they would have one person

1076
00:34:50.503 --> 00:34:53.084
stay up all night looking at a photograph.

1077
00:34:53.084 --> 00:34:54.201
And then the photograph

1078
00:34:54.201 --> 00:34:55.765
is supposed to appear in Bob's dream.

1079
00:34:55.765 --> 00:34:56.700
And it would.

1080
00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:57.899
In one of his dreams.

1081
00:34:57.899 --> 00:35:01.088
But he told me something they don't print.

1082
00:35:01.088 --> 00:35:01.718
They didn't print.

1083
00:35:01.718 --> 00:35:02.572
But he would have dreams about the

1084
00:35:02.572 --> 00:35:04.685
private life of that person too.

1085
00:35:04.685 --> 00:35:06.351
And that was dreaming out of bounds.

1086
00:35:06.351 --> 00:35:07.326
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm.</v>

1087
00:35:07.326 --> 00:35:09.154
<v ->But that showed a real dynamic.</v>

1088
00:35:09.154 --> 00:35:10.170
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->I said,</v>

1089
00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:12.303
"Of course, that's what these kids are doing!

1090
00:35:12.303 --> 00:35:13.848
"So let's set this up."

1091
00:35:13.848 --> 00:35:15.270
And then we used my dream

1092
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:17.240
as the way to arrange it.

1093
00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.500
Where we say, "Okay,

1094
00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.654
"if someone here in the crowd

1095
00:35:20.654 --> 00:35:22.381
"is having a problem, needs some help,

1096
00:35:22.381 --> 00:35:23.722
"don't tell us what it is.

1097
00:35:23.722 --> 00:35:26.546
"Just step forward, ask for help.

1098
00:35:26.546 --> 00:35:28.455
"And we will then form a group

1099
00:35:28.455 --> 00:35:30.934
"of eight people, or so, around you,

1100
00:35:30.934 --> 00:35:33.149
"and we will promise to remember

1101
00:35:33.149 --> 00:35:34.408
"a dream for you tonight.

1102
00:35:34.408 --> 00:35:36.542
"Hopefully it will help you."

1103
00:35:36.542 --> 00:35:39.122
And we come back the next morning

1104
00:35:39.122 --> 00:35:42.210
and we go around and we share our dreams.

1105
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:44.343
And this is the big thing,

1106
00:35:44.343 --> 00:35:45.908
this, I want to make a movie about this,

1107
00:35:45.908 --> 00:35:48.651
because everyone needs to know about this

1108
00:35:48.651 --> 00:35:50.479
because this is so powerful.

1109
00:35:50.479 --> 00:35:51.820
And this is so easy,

1110
00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.994
and this is almost fool proof.

1111
00:35:53.994 --> 00:35:57.021
And what it does is it shows

1112
00:35:57.021 --> 00:35:58.464
that a group of people

1113
00:35:58.464 --> 00:36:00.191
can make real help to another person

1114
00:36:00.191 --> 00:36:02.730
using their dreams, and no psychologists involved.

1115
00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:06.469
Nobody that has any dream knowledge whatsoever.

1116
00:36:06.469 --> 00:36:07.952
All they have to have is knowledge

1117
00:36:07.952 --> 00:36:09.374
about what happens in life!

1118
00:36:09.374 --> 00:36:10.451
Which we all have that.

1119
00:36:10.451 --> 00:36:11.507
We all carry it.

1120
00:36:11.507 --> 00:36:13.945
So I just call that implicit knowledge.

1121
00:36:13.945 --> 00:36:15.004
We all bring it.

1122
00:36:15.004 --> 00:36:16.078
Okay?

1123
00:36:16.078 --> 00:36:16.708
Here's what happens.

1124
00:36:16.708 --> 00:36:18.171
Well this is kind of bizarre,

1125
00:36:18.171 --> 00:36:20.284
I mean, people go away thinking, gosh,

1126
00:36:20.284 --> 00:36:22.011
you know, I want to help this person,

1127
00:36:22.011 --> 00:36:23.352
but the only way I can help him is to dream

1128
00:36:23.352 --> 00:36:24.205
for him?

1129
00:36:24.205 --> 00:36:25.627
I don't know if I'm gonna remember,

1130
00:36:25.627 --> 00:36:28.045
oh golly, what have I gotten myself in for?

1131
00:36:28.045 --> 00:36:29.203
I can tell that's how they feel.

1132
00:36:29.203 --> 00:36:30.300
I've done this for many times,

1133
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:31.763
many other people who run this.

1134
00:36:31.763 --> 00:36:33.776
I don't have to be around,

1135
00:36:33.776 --> 00:36:36.428
which is what I like about it.

1136
00:36:36.428 --> 00:36:39.038
They come back the next morning.

1137
00:36:39.038 --> 00:36:41.150
We had a person, when Margaret Mead

1138
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:42.105
was still alive, I don't know, she was

1139
00:36:42.105 --> 00:36:43.588
a famous anthropologist.

1140
00:36:43.588 --> 00:36:44.339
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm, yes.</v>

1141
00:36:44.339 --> 00:36:46.391
<v ->An out of the box kind of lady.</v>

1142
00:36:46.391 --> 00:36:47.956
She sent a graduate student down

1143
00:36:47.956 --> 00:36:49.927
to where we were doing our experiments

1144
00:36:49.927 --> 00:36:52.080
at the ARE camp where we lived together

1145
00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.173
for awhile to try this out.

1146
00:36:54.173 --> 00:36:56.326
And his doctoral dissertation showed that

1147
00:36:56.326 --> 00:36:57.708
when you get a group of people

1148
00:36:57.708 --> 00:36:59.029
and you have them live together for

1149
00:36:59.029 --> 00:37:00.593
a period of time, they're gonna have

1150
00:37:00.593 --> 00:37:03.234
a certain amount of dream activity.

1151
00:37:03.234 --> 00:37:05.063
And we did, because morning breakfast

1152
00:37:05.063 --> 00:37:06.099
we would tell dreams.

1153
00:37:06.099 --> 00:37:07.115
That's what we did at breakfast,

1154
00:37:07.115 --> 00:37:08.821
everybody got to tell their dream.

1155
00:37:08.821 --> 00:37:10.609
And we would, we had these big sheets

1156
00:37:10.609 --> 00:37:11.950
you could write dreams on them

1157
00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:13.921
so you could gather over time.

1158
00:37:13.921 --> 00:37:16.075
But when we did dream helper ceremony,

1159
00:37:16.075 --> 00:37:17.763
two or three time we did that over

1160
00:37:17.763 --> 00:37:18.899
a period of six weeks,

1161
00:37:18.899 --> 00:37:20.240
dream recall was way up.

1162
00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.174
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1163
00:37:21.174 --> 00:37:23.451
<v ->And we've proved that in the years since.</v>

1164
00:37:23.451 --> 00:37:25.238
Like elder hostels come here.

1165
00:37:25.238 --> 00:37:26.314
You know, you got guys that haven't

1166
00:37:26.314 --> 00:37:28.427
woken up with a hard on in a long time,

1167
00:37:28.427 --> 00:37:30.093
no dreams whatsoever.

1168
00:37:30.093 --> 00:37:32.714
They get here and they find me throwing

1169
00:37:32.714 --> 00:37:34.197
them into a spot where they're gonna

1170
00:37:34.197 --> 00:37:36.107
have to dream for somebody.

1171
00:37:36.107 --> 00:37:38.058
And I've seen old guys coming in,

1172
00:37:38.058 --> 00:37:38.931
they're talking to their wives,

1173
00:37:38.931 --> 00:37:41.044
they're so happy, they had a dream!

1174
00:37:41.044 --> 00:37:42.426
(laughing)
It really works!

1175
00:37:42.426 --> 00:37:44.478
You know, because the secret is

1176
00:37:44.478 --> 00:37:45.697
you will do more, you will make

1177
00:37:45.697 --> 00:37:47.241
more of an effort for somebody else

1178
00:37:47.241 --> 00:37:48.683
than you will for yourself.

1179
00:37:48.683 --> 00:37:49.455
You see.

1180
00:37:49.455 --> 00:37:50.837
So what I've done is the basic theme

1181
00:37:50.837 --> 00:37:53.011
for Cayce, so I've used altruism.

1182
00:37:53.011 --> 00:37:56.099
I use altruism as a way of elliciting

1183
00:37:56.099 --> 00:37:57.684
abilities in people that they don't

1184
00:37:57.684 --> 00:37:59.439
know that they have.

1185
00:37:59.439 --> 00:38:00.325
Okay?

1186
00:38:00.325 --> 00:38:01.910
And then the other thing I use

1187
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:05.160
is the group think where you can compare.

1188
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.964
So the first form of altruism,

1189
00:38:07.964 --> 00:38:09.427
they're all recalling dreams.

1190
00:38:09.427 --> 00:38:10.524
So that's a big help.

1191
00:38:10.524 --> 00:38:11.784
They've just been shown they can

1192
00:38:11.784 --> 00:38:13.612
remember a dream if they really have enough

1193
00:38:13.612 --> 00:38:15.360
of a reason and make an effort.

1194
00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.518
That's big.

1195
00:38:16.518 --> 00:38:17.838
That's big right there.

1196
00:38:17.838 --> 00:38:18.610
<v Voiceover>Yeah, that's big.</v>

1197
00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:19.504
<v ->Because most people say,</v>

1198
00:38:19.504 --> 00:38:20.398
"I don't remember my dreams

1199
00:38:20.398 --> 00:38:21.739
"because of this and that."

1200
00:38:21.739 --> 00:38:24.015
And I did up an inventory,

1201
00:38:24.015 --> 00:38:25.681
and most people are very passive

1202
00:38:25.681 --> 00:38:27.225
about why they don't have dream recall.

1203
00:38:27.225 --> 00:38:28.180
"Oh, it's because of this,

1204
00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:29.317
"it's because of that."

1205
00:38:29.317 --> 00:38:31.674
It has nothing to do with them.

1206
00:38:31.674 --> 00:38:33.198
If you ask them, "Does it have

1207
00:38:33.198 --> 00:38:34.315
"anything to do with how hard

1208
00:38:34.315 --> 00:38:35.270
"you try to remember?"

1209
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.990
"Well it doesn't have anything

1210
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.449
"to do with that."

1211
00:38:36.449 --> 00:38:37.627
"Does it have anything to do

1212
00:38:37.627 --> 00:38:38.623
"with how much time you spend

1213
00:38:38.623 --> 00:38:39.395
"reading about?"

1214
00:38:39.395 --> 00:38:40.106
"No it doesn't have anything."

1215
00:38:40.106 --> 00:38:41.061
"Does it have anything to do

1216
00:38:41.061 --> 00:38:42.117
"with how much time you spend

1217
00:38:42.117 --> 00:38:43.133
"in the morning trying to remember?"

1218
00:38:43.133 --> 00:38:44.007
"No, it doesn't have anything."

1219
00:38:44.007 --> 00:38:45.571
If it's about medicine,

1220
00:38:45.571 --> 00:38:46.770
or they're hard to remember,

1221
00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:48.029
you know, that kind of thing.

1222
00:38:48.029 --> 00:38:49.086
This shows them

1223
00:38:49.086 --> 00:38:50.163
when you've got a reason

1224
00:38:50.163 --> 00:38:51.239
you can do it.

1225
00:38:51.239 --> 00:38:52.458
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->All right.</v>

1226
00:38:52.458 --> 00:38:53.921
And now the other part.

1227
00:38:53.921 --> 00:38:54.937
"What does this dream

1228
00:38:54.937 --> 00:38:56.502
"have to do with anything?"

1229
00:38:56.502 --> 00:38:57.497
Well, why are you judging?

1230
00:38:57.497 --> 00:38:58.350
You don't know what the

1231
00:38:58.350 --> 00:38:59.244
person's question is,

1232
00:38:59.244 --> 00:39:00.037
you have no idea of your dream

1233
00:39:00.037 --> 00:39:01.581
is odd or not.

1234
00:39:01.581 --> 00:39:02.312
You know.

1235
00:39:02.312 --> 00:39:03.612
But they walk back in the morning,

1236
00:39:03.612 --> 00:39:06.213
they're relieved that they had a dream.

1237
00:39:06.213 --> 00:39:07.310
But they have no idea what

1238
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:08.123
their dream was about.

1239
00:39:08.123 --> 00:39:09.301
And if they had dreamt anything

1240
00:39:09.301 --> 00:39:11.150
relevant to the person.

1241
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:13.080
Well, they're in for a big surprise.

1242
00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.498
Because, you see,

1243
00:39:15.498 --> 00:39:17.509
there's a social term for it

1244
00:39:17.509 --> 00:39:20.218
called plural ignorance.

1245
00:39:20.719 --> 00:39:22.832
That is where everybody is ignorant

1246
00:39:22.832 --> 00:39:25.067
of something that's actually true for everybody.

1247
00:39:25.067 --> 00:39:26.550
But because no one talks about it,

1248
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:27.932
no one knows!

1249
00:39:27.932 --> 00:39:30.512
So everybody thinks they're the only one.

1250
00:39:30.512 --> 00:39:31.630
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->And that</v>

1251
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:35.455
can be a very toxic reality in a group.

1252
00:39:35.835 --> 00:39:37.176
Because then they'll react like they're

1253
00:39:37.176 --> 00:39:39.695
the weird person, and they're acting differently.

1254
00:39:39.695 --> 00:39:40.914
<v Voiceover>And may be afraid to share.</v>

1255
00:39:40.914 --> 00:39:41.788
<v ->Afraid to share.</v>

1256
00:39:41.788 --> 00:39:44.267
I remember when I worked for awhile

1257
00:39:44.267 --> 00:39:46.298
at social services here in Virginia Beach.

1258
00:39:46.298 --> 00:39:47.741
At the time I was just a new worker

1259
00:39:47.741 --> 00:39:50.301
when sex abuse investigations

1260
00:39:50.301 --> 00:39:52.394
were just starting.

1261
00:39:52.394 --> 00:39:54.446
And then since I was new, I said,

1262
00:39:54.446 --> 00:39:56.254
"But isn't it kind of embarrassing

1263
00:39:56.254 --> 00:39:57.534
"to go to the door and talk to the dad

1264
00:39:57.534 --> 00:39:59.078
"about diddling their daughter?"

1265
00:39:59.078 --> 00:40:00.785
And all the other social workers went,

1266
00:40:00.785 --> 00:40:02.430
"Ohhh", as I spoke.

1267
00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:03.649
(laughing)
And it turned out

1268
00:40:03.649 --> 00:40:05.071
they were all uptight about it,

1269
00:40:05.071 --> 00:40:06.798
but no one had ever talked about it.

1270
00:40:06.798 --> 00:40:07.672
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->And as a result</v>

1271
00:40:07.672 --> 00:40:09.724
we got some training, about how to

1272
00:40:09.724 --> 00:40:11.553
deal with our feelings.
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

1273
00:40:11.553 --> 00:40:12.954
<v ->You know?
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

1274
00:40:12.954 --> 00:40:13.950
<v ->Okay.</v>

1275
00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:15.596
So this person comes in, and,

1276
00:40:15.596 --> 00:40:18.076
"I had a screwy dream, uhhh."

1277
00:40:18.836 --> 00:40:20.472
I said, "Well that's all right."

1278
00:40:20.472 --> 00:40:22.286
We take the person who's being dreamed for

1279
00:40:22.286 --> 00:40:22.971
make them turn around and put a

1280
00:40:22.971 --> 00:40:24.799
sack over their head, or turn around,

1281
00:40:24.799 --> 00:40:27.095
so we cannot get any feedback from them

1282
00:40:27.095 --> 00:40:29.736
to govern our brainstorming.

1283
00:40:29.736 --> 00:40:31.219
And as the people go around

1284
00:40:31.219 --> 00:40:33.190
and start telling the dreams,

1285
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:34.938
what starts coming out is

1286
00:40:34.938 --> 00:40:36.807
they're not all that different.

1287
00:40:36.807 --> 00:40:38.574
They're different, but we can

1288
00:40:38.574 --> 00:40:40.931
start finding commonalities in them.

1289
00:40:40.931 --> 00:40:41.865
You know.

1290
00:40:41.865 --> 00:40:43.145
And I can give you some examples

1291
00:40:43.145 --> 00:40:44.100
if you wanted,

1292
00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:45.035
but the thing is

1293
00:40:45.035 --> 00:40:46.091
that when you're by yourself

1294
00:40:46.091 --> 00:40:47.351
you wouldn't be able to do that.

1295
00:40:47.351 --> 00:40:48.590
But in a group they start.

1296
00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:50.622
And they brainstorm those commonalities

1297
00:40:50.622 --> 00:40:52.796
and like they were on CSI or something

1298
00:40:52.796 --> 00:40:54.645
like that, they can use those commonalities

1299
00:40:54.645 --> 00:40:56.595
to profile the person.

1300
00:40:56.595 --> 00:40:59.460
Here's what seems to be on this persons mind.

1301
00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:02.142
Here seems to be what's troubling them,

1302
00:41:02.142 --> 00:41:03.483
and so on.

1303
00:41:03.483 --> 00:41:06.490
And so we talk about that until we're done.

1304
00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:08.176
And then we take the bag off their head

1305
00:41:08.176 --> 00:41:10.147
or let them turn around.

1306
00:41:10.147 --> 00:41:12.605
And we, all this time we haven't known.

1307
00:41:12.605 --> 00:41:14.770
We've been like blind men in the open,

1308
00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:16.689
have no idea about what we've been doing.

1309
00:41:16.689 --> 00:41:18.233
We said, it's funny that we had

1310
00:41:18.233 --> 00:41:20.326
so many commonalities, and so on.

1311
00:41:20.326 --> 00:41:21.321
And the person's like,

1312
00:41:21.321 --> 00:41:22.642
"Oh my God, you must have been

1313
00:41:22.642 --> 00:41:24.003
"reading my mind last night.

1314
00:41:24.003 --> 00:41:25.710
"Let me tell you about all the."

1315
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:27.965
And they go on listing all the ways

1316
00:41:27.965 --> 00:41:30.037
in which we picked up on stuff.

1317
00:41:30.037 --> 00:41:32.928
But that's not necessarily helpful.

1318
00:41:33.267 --> 00:41:35.956
So I said, "Well we're not done yet.

1319
00:41:36.193 --> 00:41:38.225
"So now we're gonna go back.

1320
00:41:38.225 --> 00:41:39.606
"And we're going to everybody

1321
00:41:39.606 --> 00:41:42.390
"I'm gonna give you a very simple method

1322
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:45.051
"to interpret your dream for you.

1323
00:41:45.051 --> 00:41:46.453
"Very simple.

1324
00:41:46.453 --> 00:41:48.140
"And so here's what I'm learning

1325
00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.070
"about me from my dream."

1326
00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:51.573
And so everybody goes around

1327
00:41:51.573 --> 00:41:53.727
and shares, "Here's what I'm learning about me

1328
00:41:53.727 --> 00:41:54.682
"from my dream.

1329
00:41:54.682 --> 00:41:56.815
"Here's what I'm learning about me from my dream."

1330
00:41:56.815 --> 00:41:58.623
And so by time they've gone around

1331
00:41:58.623 --> 00:41:59.802
in the circle saying that,

1332
00:41:59.802 --> 00:42:01.874
"Funny you all should say that.'

1333
00:42:01.874 --> 00:42:03.784
Yeah, we're all now, we're all realizing

1334
00:42:03.784 --> 00:42:05.470
we're all working on this same issue,

1335
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:07.420
but from very different points of view,

1336
00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:08.335
you know.

1337
00:42:08.335 --> 00:42:09.879
Very different points of view.

1338
00:42:09.879 --> 00:42:11.667
And this person who started out being

1339
00:42:11.667 --> 00:42:14.267
our quote, patient, that we were gonna help

1340
00:42:14.267 --> 00:42:15.954
has turned out to be our teacher

1341
00:42:15.954 --> 00:42:17.965
because they said, well I can affect.

1342
00:42:17.965 --> 00:42:19.672
"Here let's take it, I'm gonna suggest

1343
00:42:19.672 --> 00:42:21.866
"a human issue we all work on.

1344
00:42:21.866 --> 00:42:23.369
"Well let's see where we're at.

1345
00:42:23.369 --> 00:42:25.279
"Let's see what we can learn from one another."

1346
00:42:25.279 --> 00:42:26.437
Because that's what it's about,

1347
00:42:26.437 --> 00:42:28.388
it's like a seminar on this human issue

1348
00:42:28.388 --> 00:42:30.358
that this person got to decide about

1349
00:42:30.358 --> 00:42:32.268
but none of us knew.

1350
00:42:32.268 --> 00:42:33.182
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->But the big</v>

1351
00:42:33.182 --> 00:42:34.889
thing is, you know, I've written a lot about,

1352
00:42:34.889 --> 00:42:36.717
read a lot of studies about it.

1353
00:42:36.717 --> 00:42:38.973
But here's the big thing.

1354
00:42:38.973 --> 00:42:40.801
Is that it shows that

1355
00:42:41.651 --> 00:42:43.991
at the average person

1356
00:42:43.991 --> 00:42:45.698
to get together with a group of people

1357
00:42:45.698 --> 00:42:47.912
they have dreams as a resource

1358
00:42:47.912 --> 00:42:51.204
that they can use, no expert required.

1359
00:42:51.204 --> 00:42:53.885
Now I know that I've learned that

1360
00:42:53.885 --> 00:42:56.141
I defeat my mission

1361
00:42:56.141 --> 00:42:57.542
by running it myself.

1362
00:42:57.542 --> 00:43:00.102
Because, "Oh, it's Henry's artistry.

1363
00:43:00.102 --> 00:43:01.362
"It's his encouragement"

1364
00:43:01.362 --> 00:43:03.617
Bob (mumbling), he's run many many

1365
00:43:03.617 --> 00:43:04.917
many groups,

1366
00:43:04.917 --> 00:43:06.482
but he's always been with a group.

1367
00:43:06.482 --> 00:43:08.798
So I look at it like Bob's thing, you know.

1368
00:43:08.798 --> 00:43:11.521
Whereas I've tried to avoid running the group.

1369
00:43:11.521 --> 00:43:12.943
So they see that there was

1370
00:43:12.943 --> 00:43:15.096
no expert in the group.

1371
00:43:15.096 --> 00:43:16.275
And it worked.

1372
00:43:16.275 --> 00:43:18.652
Now I've trained, quote quote trained,

1373
00:43:18.652 --> 00:43:21.191
I've motivated a lot of people to try this,

1374
00:43:21.191 --> 00:43:23.426
where I'll say, "Okay, if you have the nerve

1375
00:43:23.426 --> 00:43:24.483
"I'll hold your hand.

1376
00:43:24.483 --> 00:43:26.494
"But when it's done you'll see

1377
00:43:26.494 --> 00:43:27.815
"you know you really didn't need to

1378
00:43:27.815 --> 00:43:30.700
"except I was a scared to do it."

1379
00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.325
That you call up some friends and say,

1380
00:43:32.325 --> 00:43:34.377
"Do you want to experience something

1381
00:43:34.377 --> 00:43:36.917
"really interesting with dreams?

1382
00:43:36.917 --> 00:43:38.827
"This is fantastic.

1383
00:43:38.827 --> 00:43:40.391
"Either come over to my house,

1384
00:43:40.391 --> 00:43:42.971
"or we'll meet at (mumbling) or whatever."

1385
00:43:42.971 --> 00:43:44.150
You get eight or nine people

1386
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:45.430
and you tell them the whole deal

1387
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:47.075
and say, "Let's get two or three people

1388
00:43:47.075 --> 00:43:48.436
"here to volunteer.

1389
00:43:48.436 --> 00:43:50.834
"Something going on in your life.

1390
00:43:50.834 --> 00:43:51.993
"And we want two or three people

1391
00:43:51.993 --> 00:43:54.775
"to volunteer, so we can put names in a hat.

1392
00:43:54.775 --> 00:43:56.299
"So we won't feel we're dreaming

1393
00:43:56.299 --> 00:43:58.148
"for you because you're always pushing

1394
00:43:58.148 --> 00:43:59.083
"at getting stuff.

1395
00:43:59.083 --> 00:44:00.545
"Instead, yeah you were pushy

1396
00:44:00.545 --> 00:44:01.663
"and you put your name in the hat,

1397
00:44:01.663 --> 00:44:02.780
"but so did two other people

1398
00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:03.979
"put their names in the hat too,

1399
00:44:03.979 --> 00:44:07.636
and synchronisity shows who we're dreaming for."

1400
00:44:07.636 --> 00:44:09.790
So every person in your circle

1401
00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:11.903
that you invited to (mumbling) knows that

1402
00:44:11.903 --> 00:44:14.138
this person does have an issue

1403
00:44:14.138 --> 00:44:15.621
and they didn't just push their way in

1404
00:44:15.621 --> 00:44:18.099
because their name was drawn from the others.

1405
00:44:18.099 --> 00:44:19.522
So then they go home and they dream.

1406
00:44:19.522 --> 00:44:20.923
They come back the next day

1407
00:44:20.923 --> 00:44:22.637
and I just give you a little set of instructions

1408
00:44:22.637 --> 00:44:24.662
that anybody can follow,

1409
00:44:24.662 --> 00:44:25.799
and you can work through it

1410
00:44:25.799 --> 00:44:26.917
and that person will be happy,

1411
00:44:26.917 --> 00:44:27.994
you'll be happy.

1412
00:44:27.994 --> 00:44:29.070
I've had people call me up,

1413
00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:29.843
"It works!

1414
00:44:29.843 --> 00:44:31.549
"We were so amazed, it worked!

1415
00:44:31.549 --> 00:44:33.723
"It really worked!"
(laughing)

1416
00:44:33.723 --> 00:44:34.739
<v Voiceover>So what--</v>
<v ->And now</v>

1417
00:44:34.739 --> 00:44:36.385
I want America to know about this

1418
00:44:36.385 --> 00:44:37.522
and soon and I are going to try

1419
00:44:37.522 --> 00:44:39.779
and raise money to get a movie on TV

1420
00:44:39.779 --> 00:44:41.770
so that when the people at home are watching

1421
00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:44.003
this, they'll look at it and they'll say,

1422
00:44:44.003 --> 00:44:45.568
"Gosh, that's so obvious.

1423
00:44:45.568 --> 00:44:47.620
"Why didn't anyone think of this before?

1424
00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:49.144
"Hey honey, we could do this.

1425
00:44:49.144 --> 00:44:51.379
"Let's call our friends, let's do this."

1426
00:44:51.379 --> 00:44:53.132
That's how I want them to respond.

1427
00:44:53.132 --> 00:44:54.000
<v Voiceover>It seems like you're talking</v>

1428
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.565
about people who you've gotten together

1429
00:44:55.565 --> 00:44:57.453
kind of naked into the situation.

1430
00:44:57.453 --> 00:44:57.961
<v ->Yeah.
<v Voiceover>Not knowing</v>

1431
00:44:57.961 --> 00:44:59.912
what to expect, feeling self-conscious.

1432
00:44:59.912 --> 00:45:00.602
<v ->Yeah.
<v Voiceover>And afraid</v>

1433
00:45:00.602 --> 00:45:01.253
to speak.

1434
00:45:01.253 --> 00:45:02.594
So what happens when you have a group

1435
00:45:02.594 --> 00:45:04.686
that has gotten over the self-consciousness

1436
00:45:04.686 --> 00:45:07.652
and now are just working together regularly?

1437
00:45:07.652 --> 00:45:09.264
<v ->Well.</v>

1438
00:45:11.392 --> 00:45:13.728
One group got himself

1439
00:45:13.728 --> 00:45:15.515
elected to the senate.

1440
00:45:15.515 --> 00:45:16.958
<v Voiceover>Whoo, okay.</v>

1441
00:45:16.958 --> 00:45:19.503
<v ->Because they helped him with strategy.</v>

1442
00:45:20.494 --> 00:45:22.472
Ummm.

1443
00:45:24.374 --> 00:45:25.878
In groups that I've done,

1444
00:45:25.878 --> 00:45:28.579
I hate to describe some of these things

1445
00:45:28.579 --> 00:45:30.245
because it's one of those,

1446
00:45:30.245 --> 00:45:31.992
if you're not there, kind of thing.

1447
00:45:31.992 --> 00:45:32.663
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->You know?</v>

1448
00:45:32.663 --> 00:45:33.557
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

1449
00:45:33.557 --> 00:45:34.552
I understand.

1450
00:45:34.552 --> 00:45:35.528
<v ->Ummm.
<v Voiceover>But I assume.</v>

1451
00:45:35.528 --> 00:45:36.360
<v ->But I'll give you,</v>

1452
00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:37.092
I'll give you one example.

1453
00:45:37.092 --> 00:45:38.006
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>
<v ->Because I got</v>

1454
00:45:38.006 --> 00:45:40.160
to do this with some theatre actors

1455
00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.683
in New York City years ago,

1456
00:45:41.683 --> 00:45:44.412
they were pretty brave souls.

1457
00:45:47.252 --> 00:45:50.447
In my first writing about this,

1458
00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:52.980
what I ended up calling

1459
00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.099
The Sundance Experiment,

1460
00:45:56.291 --> 00:45:59.237
I proposed that we know

1461
00:45:59.237 --> 00:46:01.391
that all the spiritual literature

1462
00:46:01.391 --> 00:46:03.971
suggests that we're really one being.

1463
00:46:03.971 --> 00:46:06.498
Individualized one being.

1464
00:46:06.998 --> 00:46:09.764
And that theoretically,

1465
00:46:09.764 --> 00:46:11.488
because of supports,

1466
00:46:11.488 --> 00:46:14.481
reports from spiritual literature,

1467
00:46:14.558 --> 00:46:16.182
it's possible to have the experience

1468
00:46:16.182 --> 00:46:18.200
of the truth of that.

1469
00:46:19.636 --> 00:46:21.281
And supposedly,

1470
00:46:21.281 --> 00:46:22.541
according to the spiritual literature,

1471
00:46:22.541 --> 00:46:26.063
our evolutionary trend is headed that way.

1472
00:46:26.157 --> 00:46:28.332
So one day, when there's gonna be, quote,

1473
00:46:28.332 --> 00:46:29.755
the rapture, you might say,

1474
00:46:29.755 --> 00:46:31.257
is for lack of a better word,

1475
00:46:31.257 --> 00:46:33.797
where we'll all be wow.

1476
00:46:33.797 --> 00:46:34.549
<v Voiceover>Connected.</v>
<v ->Yeah we'll be one.</v>

1477
00:46:34.549 --> 00:46:35.565
<v Voiceover>Connected, yeah.</v>

1478
00:46:35.565 --> 00:46:37.254
<v ->Heaven is here, okay.</v>

1479
00:46:37.254 --> 00:46:40.345
I say, "If that is so,

1480
00:46:41.742 --> 00:46:43.814
"then it's already prewritten

1481
00:46:43.814 --> 00:46:45.235
"and preknown.

1482
00:46:45.235 --> 00:46:47.714
"And so we know it inside."

1483
00:46:47.714 --> 00:46:49.461
So for any gathering of people

1484
00:46:49.461 --> 00:46:50.680
I say, "Take 12 people.

1485
00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.143
"Whoever they are,

1486
00:46:52.143 --> 00:46:54.235
"there is some way

1487
00:46:54.235 --> 00:46:56.958
"for them to react to one another

1488
00:46:56.958 --> 00:46:59.802
"initiate certain actions, words, and so."

1489
00:46:59.802 --> 00:47:02.059
They have no idea what it might be.

1490
00:47:02.059 --> 00:47:04.679
But there's a certain way they could come together

1491
00:47:04.679 --> 00:47:06.244
and they could have that shared enlightenment

1492
00:47:06.244 --> 00:47:08.748
experience, clearly.

1493
00:47:08.843 --> 00:47:11.099
But how would we ever discover that?

1494
00:47:11.099 --> 00:47:13.252
What if we go to sleep together

1495
00:47:13.252 --> 00:47:16.848
with the intent that we will have dreams

1496
00:47:16.848 --> 00:47:19.917
tonight that will show us

1497
00:47:19.917 --> 00:47:22.131
how to interact together

1498
00:47:22.131 --> 00:47:25.428
the next day to have that experience?

1499
00:47:26.275 --> 00:47:29.243
Given that when we wake up the next day,

1500
00:47:29.243 --> 00:47:30.440
we won't know what those dreams

1501
00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:33.000
are necessarily telling us.

1502
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.012
So how would we harvest

1503
00:47:35.012 --> 00:47:37.538
the knowledge in them?

1504
00:47:38.364 --> 00:47:40.802
So I'm trying to recruit someone

1505
00:47:40.802 --> 00:47:43.403
younger now because it takes a lot of energy.

1506
00:47:43.403 --> 00:47:44.465
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->It takes</v>

1507
00:47:44.465 --> 00:47:45.171
a lot of energy.

1508
00:47:45.171 --> 00:47:46.349
And I found a girl in Canada

1509
00:47:46.349 --> 00:47:48.341
who may do this with me.

1510
00:47:48.341 --> 00:47:50.879
Who's studying a lot in the psycho-drama.

1511
00:47:50.879 --> 00:47:52.423
Who's a pro at that.

1512
00:47:52.423 --> 00:47:54.597
And I was just an amateur

1513
00:47:54.597 --> 00:47:56.325
inspired person.

1514
00:47:56.325 --> 00:47:57.889
So I'd hear all the,

1515
00:47:57.889 --> 00:47:58.904
people tell me,

1516
00:47:58.904 --> 00:48:01.302
what are you going to start with one?

1517
00:48:01.302 --> 00:48:02.521
So you'll start with one,

1518
00:48:02.521 --> 00:48:04.228
and have the person do a little action.

1519
00:48:04.228 --> 00:48:06.158
Maybe they're miming some aspect.

1520
00:48:06.158 --> 00:48:07.844
And this is a very intuitive.

1521
00:48:07.844 --> 00:48:09.916
Then have somebody else join in.

1522
00:48:09.916 --> 00:48:11.034
Almost as if we were going to create

1523
00:48:11.034 --> 00:48:13.452
some kind of a living creature

1524
00:48:13.452 --> 00:48:15.098
that was gonna be a composite

1525
00:48:15.098 --> 00:48:16.194
of these different things.

1526
00:48:16.194 --> 00:48:18.063
Maybe someone's doing a miming,

1527
00:48:18.063 --> 00:48:20.076
somebody else is saying something,

1528
00:48:20.076 --> 00:48:21.844
over again, then we're trying this.

1529
00:48:21.844 --> 00:48:23.935
We're just drawing on our dreams.

1530
00:48:23.935 --> 00:48:25.521
Just going around,

1531
00:48:25.521 --> 00:48:27.064
and then two times now,

1532
00:48:27.064 --> 00:48:28.547
there'd be a moment,

1533
00:48:28.547 --> 00:48:30.288
and just a flash of a moment.

1534
00:48:30.288 --> 00:48:31.433
It just happens.

1535
00:48:31.433 --> 00:48:32.895
It's just there.

1536
00:48:32.895 --> 00:48:33.830
And then it goes away

1537
00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:34.947
and we know how this works.

1538
00:48:34.947 --> 00:48:36.694
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm.</v>

1539
00:48:36.694 --> 00:48:38.524
<v ->And then you lose it.</v>

1540
00:48:38.524 --> 00:48:39.559
We haven't grown enough.

1541
00:48:39.559 --> 00:48:41.774
One of the things, you see,

1542
00:48:41.774 --> 00:48:42.952
and this gets into all of my

1543
00:48:42.952 --> 00:48:44.577
intuitive heart training,

1544
00:48:44.577 --> 00:48:46.101
with the breath work,

1545
00:48:46.101 --> 00:48:48.823
is that in order for this heaven to come

1546
00:48:48.823 --> 00:48:51.364
we have to drop our shame.

1547
00:48:51.364 --> 00:48:52.602
We all have shame.

1548
00:48:52.602 --> 00:48:53.618
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->You know?</v>

1549
00:48:53.618 --> 00:48:55.548
When she bit in the apple

1550
00:48:55.548 --> 00:48:57.925
the first thing she did was hide.

1551
00:48:57.925 --> 00:48:58.698
You know?

1552
00:48:58.698 --> 00:49:00.668
And we need that exposure.

1553
00:49:00.668 --> 00:49:02.375
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->And this,</v>

1554
00:49:02.375 --> 00:49:03.309
I don't know if you were there

1555
00:49:03.309 --> 00:49:05.483
for that healing thing that I was describing.

1556
00:49:05.483 --> 00:49:07.617
That this comes out of the intuitive heart work

1557
00:49:07.617 --> 00:49:09.974
and again, it's just kind of a natural thing

1558
00:49:09.974 --> 00:49:12.310
without having an intent, but actually

1559
00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:14.504
not really knowing what you're doing

1560
00:49:14.504 --> 00:49:17.248
allowing this healing to occur

1561
00:49:17.248 --> 00:49:20.011
by somehow mischievously bringing

1562
00:49:20.011 --> 00:49:22.224
up one another's shame.

1563
00:49:22.224 --> 00:49:23.687
Or healing.

1564
00:49:24.467 --> 00:49:26.472
And it be where

1565
00:49:26.472 --> 00:49:28.238
maybe you play doctor once

1566
00:49:28.238 --> 00:49:31.062
in a way that made you feel ashamed.

1567
00:49:31.062 --> 00:49:32.364
And for some reason

1568
00:49:32.364 --> 00:49:34.821
I'm recalling a time when I played doctor

1569
00:49:34.821 --> 00:49:36.733
and had a different tone on it,

1570
00:49:36.733 --> 00:49:38.134
but because of the way I say it

1571
00:49:38.134 --> 00:49:39.902
it taps right into your feeling,

1572
00:49:39.902 --> 00:49:42.216
all of a sudden you see it from another perspective.

1573
00:49:42.216 --> 00:49:43.374
<v Voiceover>Uh huh.</v>
<v ->And when we</v>

1574
00:49:43.374 --> 00:49:45.083
see something from another perspective

1575
00:49:45.083 --> 00:49:47.194
there's a group that calls that a miracle.

1576
00:49:47.194 --> 00:49:48.129
<v Voiceover>Uh huh.</v>
<v ->You know?</v>

1577
00:49:48.129 --> 00:49:49.694
(laughing)
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

1578
00:49:49.694 --> 00:49:50.831
<v ->And you don't have to be in that group</v>

1579
00:49:50.831 --> 00:49:53.452
to think about why that really is a miracle

1580
00:49:53.452 --> 00:49:55.769
to shift perspectives.

1581
00:49:55.769 --> 00:49:57.597
<v Voiceover>So releasing this collective</v>

1582
00:49:57.597 --> 00:49:59.568
and individual shame, everyone carries

1583
00:49:59.568 --> 00:50:01.376
around something or another.

1584
00:50:01.376 --> 00:50:02.249
<v ->Something or another.</v>

1585
00:50:02.249 --> 00:50:04.220
<v Voiceover>Really releases the being,</v>

1586
00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:05.012
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>to be able</v>

1587
00:50:05.012 --> 00:50:07.166
to start speaking.

1588
00:50:07.166 --> 00:50:09.197
To communicate more clearly

1589
00:50:09.197 --> 00:50:10.762
with ourselves?
<v ->I'll describe</v>

1590
00:50:10.762 --> 00:50:13.119
to you my dream of the research dance.

1591
00:50:13.119 --> 00:50:14.163
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>
<v ->When I first</v>

1592
00:50:14.163 --> 00:50:16.369
came to Virginia Beach

1593
00:50:16.369 --> 00:50:19.356
when Charles Thomas invited me here,

1594
00:50:19.356 --> 00:50:22.669
and I went to sleep at his farm, I woke up

1595
00:50:23.149 --> 00:50:24.659
with this dream.

1596
00:50:24.659 --> 00:50:27.733
We were in front of the ARE building.

1597
00:50:28.195 --> 00:50:29.475
We had come together

1598
00:50:29.475 --> 00:50:30.774
to get enlightened.

1599
00:50:30.774 --> 00:50:32.990
But we didn't know what we were doing.

1600
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:34.167
It was dark,

1601
00:50:34.167 --> 00:50:36.097
we were bumping into one another,

1602
00:50:36.097 --> 00:50:38.399
nothing was working.

1603
00:50:38.719 --> 00:50:41.096
And then, for some reason,

1604
00:50:41.096 --> 00:50:42.721
that's always a great phrase in the dream,

1605
00:50:42.721 --> 00:50:45.179
for some reason, we started dancing.

1606
00:50:45.179 --> 00:50:47.298
(laughing)

1607
00:50:49.406 --> 00:50:50.949
We started dancing.

1608
00:50:50.949 --> 00:50:52.046
And the funny thing was

1609
00:50:52.046 --> 00:50:53.205
we were just dancing around

1610
00:50:53.205 --> 00:50:55.704
you know, I think it's called all the men right,

1611
00:50:55.704 --> 00:50:57.186
all the men left, and you square dance,

1612
00:50:57.186 --> 00:50:58.527
and you work your way around

1613
00:50:58.527 --> 00:51:00.132
and get to see everybody?

1614
00:51:00.132 --> 00:51:02.245
We were doing that kind of thing.

1615
00:51:02.245 --> 00:51:03.220
But what we were doing is

1616
00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:04.602
when we were dancing everybody

1617
00:51:04.602 --> 00:51:07.202
had this round thing that they were showing.

1618
00:51:07.202 --> 00:51:08.787
It was a shield.

1619
00:51:08.787 --> 00:51:10.270
It was like a Mondale,

1620
00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:11.936
it was symbolism.

1621
00:51:11.936 --> 00:51:13.643
And as we would dance we would look at

1622
00:51:13.643 --> 00:51:15.370
the persons symbolism,

1623
00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:16.873
and as we saw the symbolism

1624
00:51:16.873 --> 00:51:19.494
we recognized who they really were.

1625
00:51:19.494 --> 00:51:22.420
And it was, as we were recognizing

1626
00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:23.964
each other, that's what was doing it.

1627
00:51:23.964 --> 00:51:25.427
It was the recognition,

1628
00:51:25.427 --> 00:51:26.544
and all of a sudden

1629
00:51:26.544 --> 00:51:28.840
a big fountain of sparks shot up

1630
00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:30.831
from our dance, like a volcano

1631
00:51:30.831 --> 00:51:32.314
burst in the middle of our circle.

1632
00:51:32.314 --> 00:51:33.919
And it was bright out,

1633
00:51:33.919 --> 00:51:35.138
and we could see.

1634
00:51:35.138 --> 00:51:37.759
And we realized this is the way.

1635
00:51:37.759 --> 00:51:40.258
This is the way to the enlightenment.

1636
00:51:40.258 --> 00:51:42.676
And since then like sparks,

1637
00:51:42.676 --> 00:51:45.134
in dreams sparks, that really goes to

1638
00:51:45.134 --> 00:51:47.308
like the primordial creative, you know,

1639
00:51:47.308 --> 00:51:49.137
when they talked about new stars being formed,

1640
00:51:49.137 --> 00:51:51.087
there's sparks kind of a thing?

1641
00:51:51.087 --> 00:51:52.956
And this is what led me later to

1642
00:51:52.956 --> 00:51:55.984
A, the idea about the photosynthesis,

1643
00:51:55.984 --> 00:51:58.294
because that was an energy generating

1644
00:51:58.294 --> 00:51:59.823
kind of a thing.

1645
00:51:59.823 --> 00:52:01.672
And also, the way we were communicating.

1646
00:52:01.672 --> 00:52:03.399
I was trying to describe today to the

1647
00:52:03.399 --> 00:52:05.329
people, you know, we learn in school

1648
00:52:05.329 --> 00:52:07.381
about the language, and make the letters right,

1649
00:52:07.381 --> 00:52:09.068
and drive on the right hand side of the road,

1650
00:52:09.068 --> 00:52:10.144
and all of that.

1651
00:52:10.144 --> 00:52:12.034
And so we learn how to communicate

1652
00:52:12.034 --> 00:52:13.761
at the conscious level.

1653
00:52:13.761 --> 00:52:15.264
We're constantly communicating

1654
00:52:15.264 --> 00:52:16.626
at an unconscious level,

1655
00:52:16.626 --> 00:52:18.759
but we've never been trained to observe

1656
00:52:18.759 --> 00:52:20.994
and actually interact there.

1657
00:52:20.994 --> 00:52:22.355
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1658
00:52:22.355 --> 00:52:23.025
<v ->You see?</v>

1659
00:52:23.025 --> 00:52:24.062
And so in this dream

1660
00:52:24.062 --> 00:52:25.687
we are interacting at that level.

1661
00:52:25.687 --> 00:52:27.881
We're showing one another our symbols

1662
00:52:27.881 --> 00:52:30.157
which are the way our souls
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1663
00:52:30.157 --> 00:52:31.843
<v ->would think, symbolically.</v>

1664
00:52:31.843 --> 00:52:32.554
And because

1665
00:52:32.554 --> 00:52:34.525
we're recognizing each other at that level,

1666
00:52:34.525 --> 00:52:36.638
that's what produces the energy.

1667
00:52:36.638 --> 00:52:38.141
We could have sat around and BSd

1668
00:52:38.141 --> 00:52:40.437
about the science of whatever forever,

1669
00:52:40.437 --> 00:52:42.023
and never achieved anything.

1670
00:52:42.023 --> 00:52:42.956
<v Voiceover>But it sounds like it was</v>

1671
00:52:42.956 --> 00:52:44.358
also a moving past separation.

1672
00:52:44.358 --> 00:52:45.334
<v ->Oh yeah.
<v Voiceover>To truly</v>

1673
00:52:45.334 --> 00:52:47.182
recognize each other as beautiful

1674
00:52:47.182 --> 00:52:49.438
sovereign aspects of the same.

1675
00:52:49.438 --> 00:52:50.657
<v ->Of the same.
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

1676
00:52:50.657 --> 00:52:51.774
<v ->See that's the,</v>

1677
00:52:51.774 --> 00:52:53.704
where's the sovereign.

1678
00:52:53.704 --> 00:52:55.939
Freud said, "What do women want?

1679
00:52:55.939 --> 00:52:57.686
"Women want sovereignty."

1680
00:52:57.686 --> 00:52:59.291
Okay, well now.

1681
00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:04.514
This is a big issue.

1682
00:53:04.514 --> 00:53:07.601
And this is not just an issue for women.

1683
00:53:07.601 --> 00:53:10.709
This is all part of the teachings.

1684
00:53:10.709 --> 00:53:11.949
And I should say, not just the teaching

1685
00:53:11.949 --> 00:53:14.001
the discovery, because I'm saying this,

1686
00:53:14.001 --> 00:53:16.520
"Look, I don't have the answers.

1687
00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:18.511
"All I think is I've stumbled on a process

1688
00:53:18.511 --> 00:53:20.239
"by which we can work together

1689
00:53:20.239 --> 00:53:22.089
"for what we want."

1690
00:53:22.089 --> 00:53:23.204
You know.

1691
00:53:23.204 --> 00:53:25.338
That we have to be creative together.

1692
00:53:25.338 --> 00:53:26.780
My training is

1693
00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:28.263
everybody teaches training on

1694
00:53:28.263 --> 00:53:30.417
how you can be intuitive to get ahead in the world.

1695
00:53:30.417 --> 00:53:33.180
My training is how we can be intuitive together.

1696
00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:34.541
So we can harmonize with the world

1697
00:53:34.541 --> 00:53:36.675
and be smarter together.

1698
00:53:36.675 --> 00:53:38.625
You know, the nurses, the nurses

1699
00:53:38.625 --> 00:53:39.905
already know how to be intuitive.

1700
00:53:39.905 --> 00:53:41.571
They don't need training in intuition.

1701
00:53:41.571 --> 00:53:43.359
They walk past a persons room,

1702
00:53:43.359 --> 00:53:45.330
they see all the computers, they're saying

1703
00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:46.813
this persons fine.

1704
00:53:46.813 --> 00:53:49.393
But they sense inside somethings wrong.

1705
00:53:49.393 --> 00:53:50.795
They call the doctor, and you know

1706
00:53:50.795 --> 00:53:52.562
she comes over and she says,

1707
00:53:52.562 --> 00:53:54.005
"What's wrong here nurse?"

1708
00:53:54.005 --> 00:53:55.285
And the nurse says, "Well,

1709
00:53:55.285 --> 00:53:56.971
"all the signals say it's okay,

1710
00:53:56.971 --> 00:53:58.719
"but I've got this feeling inside

1711
00:53:58.719 --> 00:53:59.734
"that something's wrong."

1712
00:53:59.734 --> 00:54:01.197
The doctor, she says, "Well you know

1713
00:54:01.197 --> 00:54:02.823
"we can't go by hunches.

1714
00:54:02.823 --> 00:54:04.123
"We've got to go by tests

1715
00:54:04.123 --> 00:54:05.809
"or insurance won't pay."

1716
00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:06.622
You know?

1717
00:54:06.622 --> 00:54:07.658
So that's how we're stuck.

1718
00:54:07.658 --> 00:54:10.016
Okay, change, move forward a little bit.

1719
00:54:10.016 --> 00:54:11.153
They've had some training.

1720
00:54:11.153 --> 00:54:12.920
Now, nurse calls the doctor.

1721
00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:13.895
"What's wrong nurse?"

1722
00:54:13.895 --> 00:54:16.821
"Well, all the lights say everything's fine.

1723
00:54:16.821 --> 00:54:19.361
"But I've got this feeling nothing's not right."

1724
00:54:19.361 --> 00:54:21.128
The doctor says, "Okay, well give me a moment,

1725
00:54:21.128 --> 00:54:22.042
"let me tune in.

1726
00:54:22.042 --> 00:54:22.957
"See what I get.

1727
00:54:22.957 --> 00:54:23.668
"Mmmm.

1728
00:54:23.668 --> 00:54:25.293
Well, I kind of get a mmm ahhh mmm ahhh

1729
00:54:25.293 --> 00:54:26.350
kind of thing.

1730
00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:27.569
"What have you been getting nurse?"

1731
00:54:27.569 --> 00:54:29.032
"Well that's funny you should say that,

1732
00:54:29.032 --> 00:54:30.596
"because I get an on and off,

1733
00:54:30.596 --> 00:54:31.449
"on and off."

1734
00:54:31.449 --> 00:54:32.953
"Well, what's that remind you of?

1735
00:54:32.953 --> 00:54:33.867
"Let's think."

1736
00:54:33.867 --> 00:54:35.614
"Oh, could that be a sodium chloride?"

1737
00:54:35.614 --> 00:54:37.565
"Maybe so, let's go test that."

1738
00:54:37.565 --> 00:54:38.438
<v Voiceover>That's the future.</v>

1739
00:54:38.438 --> 00:54:39.375
<v ->That's the future, see.</v>

1740
00:54:39.375 --> 00:54:40.998
They're working together.

1741
00:54:40.998 --> 00:54:41.669
<v Voiceover>Yes, yes.</v>
<v ->You see.</v>

1742
00:54:41.669 --> 00:54:44.594
And like with dreams,

1743
00:54:44.594 --> 00:54:45.691
when someone asks me,

1744
00:54:45.691 --> 00:54:46.768
they did an interview with me,

1745
00:54:46.768 --> 00:54:48.333
20 years after I was called

1746
00:54:48.333 --> 00:54:49.674
the father of the modern dream

1747
00:54:49.674 --> 00:54:51.401
work movement,

1748
00:54:51.401 --> 00:54:53.818
"Have you noticed any changes."

1749
00:54:53.818 --> 00:54:55.972
And I say, "Well, I think there's been

1750
00:54:55.972 --> 00:54:57.110
"one change, but you might not

1751
00:54:57.110 --> 00:55:00.177
"appreciate how significant it is."

1752
00:55:00.177 --> 00:55:01.295
"What's that?"

1753
00:55:01.295 --> 00:55:04.302
And I said, "Well, let's say in 1970,

1754
00:55:04.302 --> 00:55:06.049
"you're at a party.

1755
00:55:06.049 --> 00:55:08.487
"And you say to your group,

1756
00:55:08.487 --> 00:55:11.230
""Last night I had a dream about a snake."

1757
00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:12.632
"What's the reaction?

1758
00:55:12.632 --> 00:55:14.807
(laughing)

1759
00:55:14.807 --> 00:55:15.943
"Was it rattling its tail?

1760
00:55:15.943 --> 00:55:18.056
(laughing)
"Kind of thing.

1761
00:55:18.056 --> 00:55:21.246
"Move ahead to 2000,

1762
00:55:21.246 --> 00:55:22.546
"and you're at a party,

1763
00:55:22.546 --> 00:55:23.806
"and you say, "I had a dream

1764
00:55:23.806 --> 00:55:25.045
"with a snake in it."

1765
00:55:25.045 --> 00:55:25.980
So I'm going to say,

1766
00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:27.890
"What kind of snake was it?"

1767
00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:29.801
That's a big change.

1768
00:55:29.801 --> 00:55:30.429
<v Voiceover>Big change.</v>

1769
00:55:30.429 --> 00:55:33.457
<v ->That is a big big change.</v>

1770
00:55:33.457 --> 00:55:35.346
And you're welcome.

1771
00:55:35.346 --> 00:55:36.037
For that.

1772
00:55:36.037 --> 00:55:36.911
<v Voiceover>That's fabulous.</v>

1773
00:55:36.911 --> 00:55:38.008
<v ->Now I'm trying to go on</v>

1774
00:55:38.008 --> 00:55:40.019
to the intuition part.

1775
00:55:40.019 --> 00:55:42.072
Because what came out of

1776
00:55:42.072 --> 00:55:43.412
the dream helper ceremony

1777
00:55:43.412 --> 00:55:44.164
was the question,

1778
00:55:44.164 --> 00:55:46.643
"How can people dream for one another?"

1779
00:55:46.643 --> 00:55:48.411
Well, because they're clearly communicating

1780
00:55:48.411 --> 00:55:50.564
unconsciously all the time.

1781
00:55:50.564 --> 00:55:51.844
So what I've done,

1782
00:55:51.844 --> 00:55:54.689
given the charge I got from the place here

1783
00:55:54.689 --> 00:55:56.374
because I invent spiritual exercises

1784
00:55:56.374 --> 00:55:58.386
that had psychic in them,

1785
00:55:58.386 --> 00:56:00.336
I've invented a number we call

1786
00:56:00.336 --> 00:56:01.799
intuitive heart training

1787
00:56:01.799 --> 00:56:03.953
that gives the waking equivalent

1788
00:56:03.953 --> 00:56:04.887
of what people are doing

1789
00:56:04.887 --> 00:56:06.777
when they're sleeping.

1790
00:56:06.777 --> 00:56:10.150
So that they can be intuitive together.

1791
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:11.246
And we got to experiencing

1792
00:56:11.246 --> 00:56:12.547
some of, what we start with the heart

1793
00:56:12.547 --> 00:56:15.966
connection and describing those experiences.

1794
00:56:16.285 --> 00:56:18.662
And that's the beginning of it.

1795
00:56:18.662 --> 00:56:20.612
And now I've been training teachers

1796
00:56:20.612 --> 00:56:21.872
to go out and run these groups

1797
00:56:21.872 --> 00:56:22.991
and teach other people

1798
00:56:22.991 --> 00:56:24.149
about these things.

1799
00:56:24.149 --> 00:56:26.140
I say, have them do the dream helper ceremony

1800
00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:28.008
because that opens their eyes.

1801
00:56:28.008 --> 00:56:29.186
And these other things.

1802
00:56:29.186 --> 00:56:31.300
One ladies taking it into the schools

1803
00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:33.372
and homes for our kid and a parent

1804
00:56:33.372 --> 00:56:34.164
to have a heart connection.

1805
00:56:34.164 --> 00:56:34.774
<v Voiceover>Wonderful.</v>

1806
00:56:34.774 --> 00:56:36.684
<v ->Which just seems like an obvious thing,</v>

1807
00:56:36.684 --> 00:56:39.407
but get them to talk about it,

1808
00:56:39.407 --> 00:56:42.372
that's an eye opener for the parent

1809
00:56:42.372 --> 00:56:45.094
to listen to the kid describe something.

1810
00:56:45.094 --> 00:56:47.499
They're so sophisticated.

1811
00:56:48.467 --> 00:56:50.235
If I ask a kid, you know, we say,

1812
00:56:50.235 --> 00:56:51.983
"It's all inside.

1813
00:56:51.983 --> 00:56:54.481
"And God is as big as the whole wide world

1814
00:56:54.481 --> 00:56:57.244
"how can you fit God inside?"

1815
00:56:57.244 --> 00:56:58.240
And the kid says, "Well it's easy.

1816
00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:00.171
"You just love him."

1817
00:57:00.171 --> 00:57:01.084
<v Voiceover>Yeah, there you go.</v>

1818
00:57:01.084 --> 00:57:01.754
<v ->See?
<v Voiceover>Okay,</v>

1819
00:57:01.754 --> 00:57:04.092
so now, because we're almost out of time

1820
00:57:04.092 --> 00:57:06.550
together, how does a person plug into this

1821
00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:08.825
if they want to become involved?

1822
00:57:08.825 --> 00:57:11.264
<v ->Well, there's a lot of ways to plug in.</v>

1823
00:57:11.264 --> 00:57:13.600
One way would be to email me

1824
00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:14.595
and say, "Do you want to plug in?

1825
00:57:14.595 --> 00:57:15.936
"What can you do?"

1826
00:57:15.936 --> 00:57:17.176
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>
<v ->And depends.</v>

1827
00:57:17.176 --> 00:57:18.699
I offer classes.

1828
00:57:18.699 --> 00:57:21.618
We're having in the summer only.

1829
00:57:21.618 --> 00:57:24.388
I do, my main focus right now

1830
00:57:24.388 --> 00:57:28.024
is training people to be intuitive heart facilitators.

1831
00:57:28.024 --> 00:57:30.341
And then get a credential from the Edgar Cayce

1832
00:57:30.341 --> 00:57:32.778
Institute of Intuitive Studies.

1833
00:57:32.778 --> 00:57:35.054
And I work them intensively over the phone

1834
00:57:35.054 --> 00:57:36.862
on a one on one basis

1835
00:57:36.862 --> 00:57:38.387
to use the skills,

1836
00:57:38.387 --> 00:57:39.850
not to just do a group,

1837
00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:41.110
because that's what Cayce would want.

1838
00:57:41.110 --> 00:57:42.267
He'd have you do a group once

1839
00:57:42.267 --> 00:57:44.076
and that's your initiation.

1840
00:57:44.076 --> 00:57:47.164
But to incorporate it into your work.

1841
00:57:47.164 --> 00:57:48.972
So I have a teacher

1842
00:57:48.972 --> 00:57:50.232
who is bringing some of the things

1843
00:57:50.232 --> 00:57:51.490
into the classroom

1844
00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:53.320
and teaching the kids about heart connection

1845
00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.741
and the animal communicator

1846
00:57:54.741 --> 00:57:56.366
using some of the things,

1847
00:57:56.366 --> 00:57:57.931
not just in talking to the animals,

1848
00:57:57.931 --> 00:58:01.527
but in now he can teach his followers better.

1849
00:58:01.527 --> 00:58:02.888
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->What they were doing.</v>

1850
00:58:02.888 --> 00:58:04.129
Of course there's counselors.

1851
00:58:04.129 --> 00:58:05.773
I have one doctor who's using

1852
00:58:05.773 --> 00:58:09.004
just one little aspect for relaxation training

1853
00:58:09.004 --> 00:58:09.959
because she likes that.

1854
00:58:09.959 --> 00:58:11.320
And then she uses other aspects

1855
00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:15.247
for her own private diagnoses of the person.

1856
00:58:15.343 --> 00:58:16.440
<v Voiceover>So there's a number</v>

1857
00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:17.557
of different people that can plug in to.

1858
00:58:17.557 --> 00:58:18.898
So all they have to do

1859
00:58:18.898 --> 00:58:20.605
is basically email you

1860
00:58:20.605 --> 00:58:22.291
and you'll put them in touch

1861
00:58:22.291 --> 00:58:23.490
with what sounds like they

1862
00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:24.851
might best benefit by?

1863
00:58:24.851 --> 00:58:27.249
<v ->You see, intuition training</v>

1864
00:58:27.249 --> 00:58:28.997
really has to be tailored.

1865
00:58:28.997 --> 00:58:30.135
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->I have</v>

1866
00:58:30.135 --> 00:58:31.901
some general stuff,

1867
00:58:31.901 --> 00:58:33.831
but then it's how they respond individually

1868
00:58:33.831 --> 00:58:35.538
to that, you see, as they go onto the

1869
00:58:35.538 --> 00:58:36.940
next thing.

1870
00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:39.459
<v Voiceover>Well I've enjoyed this hour with you</v>

1871
00:58:39.459 --> 00:58:41.348
and I wish you were a little more animated.

1872
00:58:41.348 --> 00:58:42.405
(laughing)
<v ->Well I wish we had</v>

1873
00:58:42.405 --> 00:58:43.278
a little more time, you know,

1874
00:58:43.278 --> 00:58:45.392
to tell all the aspects of the story.

1875
00:58:45.392 --> 00:58:46.590
<v Voiceover>Oh gosh, there's so much.</v>

1876
00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:48.825
<v ->I keep wondering if this is a story</v>

1877
00:58:48.825 --> 00:58:51.446
that would be worth writing a book about,

1878
00:58:51.446 --> 00:58:54.107
but it's so discouraging, you know?

1879
00:58:54.107 --> 00:58:55.937
I'm not in a position where I can travel

1880
00:58:55.937 --> 00:58:57.744
around the country anymore.

1881
00:58:57.744 --> 00:58:59.776
And they say a publisher only wants to know

1882
00:58:59.776 --> 00:59:02.073
how many people am I going to be in front of.

1883
00:59:02.073 --> 00:59:04.307
They don't even care what I want to write about.

1884
00:59:04.307 --> 00:59:06.421
And I can't write unless I get paid for it,

1885
00:59:06.421 --> 00:59:08.045
I don't have the time, you know.

1886
00:59:08.045 --> 00:59:09.773
<v Voiceover>Maybe someone listening,</v>

1887
00:59:09.773 --> 00:59:12.927
or someone here around the KC Institute

1888
00:59:12.927 --> 00:59:14.872
might be able to help you on that.

1889
00:59:14.872 --> 00:59:16.355
<v ->Well they have a famous</v>

1890
00:59:16.355 --> 00:59:17.330
<v Voiceover>Well good luck on that.</v>

1891
00:59:17.330 --> 00:59:18.341
<v ->channeling book but it goes nowhere.</v>

1892
00:59:18.341 --> 00:59:19.830
(laughing)

1893
00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:20.907
<v Voiceover>Because you won't get out there</v>

1894
00:59:20.907 --> 00:59:22.003
and pump it.

1895
00:59:22.003 --> 00:59:23.181
<v ->Other people, yeah.</v>

1896
00:59:23.181 --> 00:59:23.892
<v Voiceover>There you go.</v>

1897
00:59:23.892 --> 00:59:25.213
<v ->This place is not meant to</v>

1898
00:59:25.213 --> 00:59:26.209
be a success.

1899
00:59:26.209 --> 00:59:27.041
<v Voiceover>I understand.</v>
<v ->So they</v>

1900
00:59:27.041 --> 00:59:28.160
sent me outside the box.

1901
00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:28.911
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->In order to</v>

1902
00:59:28.911 --> 00:59:31.139
create success for them.

1903
00:59:31.139 --> 00:59:33.178
<v Voiceover>And on that note, let's hope</v>

1904
00:59:33.178 --> 00:59:35.636
that this magnetizes exactly what you need to.

1905
00:59:35.636 --> 00:59:38.171
And thank you so much for sharing with us.

1906
00:59:38.171 --> 00:59:39.867
<v ->You're welcome.</v>

1907
00:59:40.838 --> 00:59:41.955
<v ->Henry is highly active</v>

1908
00:59:41.955 --> 00:59:43.011
in the dreaming community

1909
00:59:43.011 --> 00:59:44.453
and you can connect with him

1910
00:59:44.453 --> 00:59:45.876
at henryreed.com.

1911
00:59:45.876 --> 00:59:47.683
And that's R-E-E-D.

1912
00:59:47.683 --> 00:59:49.431
In addition, he has a new book out

1913
00:59:49.431 --> 00:59:51.076
called, "Dream Medicine",

1914
00:59:51.076 --> 00:59:52.214
which explains how dreams

1915
00:59:52.214 --> 00:59:54.164
are ready to teach us about themselves

1916
00:59:54.164 --> 00:59:55.973
so that we can use that information

1917
00:59:55.973 --> 00:59:57.517
in our every day lives.

1918
00:59:57.517 --> 00:59:58.715
If you're looking for more work

1919
00:59:58.715 --> 00:59:59.996
on dream time, you might also

1920
00:59:59.996 --> 01:00:02.129
enjoy my interview with Robert Moss,

1921
01:00:02.129 --> 01:00:03.593
author of, "Active Dreaming."

1922
01:00:03.593 --> 01:00:04.546
Until next time,

1923
01:00:04.546 --> 01:00:07.561
thanks for watching CMN.
