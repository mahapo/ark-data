1
00:00:00.288 --> 00:00:02.869
<v ->Wilhelm Reich was one of the most original thinkers</v>

2
00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:05.706
of the last century, yet few know his name.

3
00:00:05.706 --> 00:00:07.168
As with many other pioneers

4
00:00:07.168 --> 00:00:09.141
in the fields of science and medicine,

5
00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:11.093
Reich was too far ahead of his peers

6
00:00:11.093 --> 00:00:13.791
to be allowed to flourish, but today,

7
00:00:13.791 --> 00:00:15.156
50 years after his death,

8
00:00:15.156 --> 00:00:17.193
James Demeo is picking up the gauntlet

9
00:00:17.193 --> 00:00:20.436
and uses Reich's principles to take humanity forward,

10
00:00:20.436 --> 00:00:23.689
including our understanding of sex and economics.

11
00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.291
(ethereal music)

12
00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:36.809
<v Regina>Wilhelm Reich is a very much misunderstood</v>

13
00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.235
person in the history of understanding life force energy.

14
00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:44.599
And you have really made it your life's work to understand

15
00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:47.437
what this man was doing to be able to connect dots

16
00:00:47.437 --> 00:00:52.150
and bring it into common modern culture today.

17
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.977
Let's talk about first his beginning

18
00:00:54.977 --> 00:00:56.620
in association with Freud

19
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.879
before we go into yours.

20
00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.594
<v ->Okay,</v>

21
00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:03.959
Reich was a refugee

22
00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:06.559
from conditions in World War I.

23
00:01:06.559 --> 00:01:09.942
At the end of the war he came to Vienna,

24
00:01:09.942 --> 00:01:13.530
took a university degree in Medicine,

25
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.368
and his residency was

26
00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:18.708
partly with Sigmund Freud,

27
00:01:18.708 --> 00:01:20.459
he became attracted to Freud's work,

28
00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:22.884
became a devoted psychoanalyst,

29
00:01:22.884 --> 00:01:27.492
and very quickly was brought up in the ranks

30
00:01:27.492 --> 00:01:30.425
of the analytical movement to become one of Freud's

31
00:01:30.425 --> 00:01:34.041
trainers for younger students.

32
00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:37.859
And Reich is well-acknowledged as the leader

33
00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:40.536
of kind of a rebel group within psychoanalysis,

34
00:01:40.536 --> 00:01:44.600
was really looking to make social changes in the world

35
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.587
as a way to prevent neurosis in the first place,

36
00:01:47.587 --> 00:01:51.308
rather than coming after the fact with only therapy.

37
00:01:51.308 --> 00:01:55.405
So that was his start, was in Freudian psychoanalysis,

38
00:01:55.405 --> 00:01:59.938
which is where he got familiar with the idea of libido,

39
00:01:59.938 --> 00:02:04.247
the whole idea of sexual energy or emotional energy,

40
00:02:04.247 --> 00:02:07.745
which, by the way, modern psychoanalysis kind of pu-pu's,

41
00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:11.478
it's not a real essential thing for most of them,

42
00:02:11.478 --> 00:02:14.827
but Reich took this idea of libido very seriously,

43
00:02:14.827 --> 00:02:18.714
and talked about how

44
00:02:18.714 --> 00:02:23.008
people's emotional energy was a real energy,

45
00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:25.415
that their sexual energy

46
00:02:25.415 --> 00:02:28.115
was something that functioned

47
00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:29.470
that required fulfillment

48
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.866
in order for people to have a healthy psyche.

49
00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:38.665
So that was the starting point of his interest in things

50
00:02:38.665 --> 00:02:42.664
like emotional energy or energy dynamics,

51
00:02:42.664 --> 00:02:44.819
biological energy, if you will.

52
00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.440
<v Regina>Because that would be certainly one of the most</v>

53
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.055
obvious and pervasive profound energies

54
00:02:51.055 --> 00:02:54.076
that he could begin measuring, even, right?

55
00:02:54.076 --> 00:02:56.935
<v ->Well, absolutely.</v>

56
00:02:56.935 --> 00:02:59.743
And at one point, he broke with Freud.

57
00:02:59.743 --> 00:03:03.950
There was a break, basically on the issue

58
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.706
of the social ramifications of Freud's own theory,

59
00:03:07.706 --> 00:03:11.482
as Reich described it,

60
00:03:11.482 --> 00:03:14.020
that one really needed to have a change in things like

61
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.278
at the time,

62
00:03:16.278 --> 00:03:20.088
women were not getting employed,

63
00:03:20.088 --> 00:03:23.283
the divorce laws, there weren't, divorce was illegal.

64
00:03:23.283 --> 00:03:25.510
Contraception was illegal, so you had

65
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.069
big problems with family and society,

66
00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.917
and arranged marriages, loveless conditions,

67
00:03:30.917 --> 00:03:32.912
and a lot of neurosis coming out of this.

68
00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:35.546
Reich wanted to change these things socially.

69
00:03:35.546 --> 00:03:38.639
The Freudians didn't, and of course, then,

70
00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:43.295
the rise of the Nazis, some of the psychoanalysts

71
00:03:43.295 --> 00:03:45.082
felt that they could get along with the Nazis,

72
00:03:45.082 --> 00:03:47.012
Reich said, no, this is a social disaster,

73
00:03:47.012 --> 00:03:49.913
and he fought against them, openly speaking against them,

74
00:03:49.913 --> 00:03:53.048
and was, therefore, forced to flee,

75
00:03:53.048 --> 00:03:57.230
first to Scandinavia and later to the United States,

76
00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.176
but during this period of flight, of leaving Austria

77
00:04:01.176 --> 00:04:05.239
and Germany to Denmark and later, Norway,

78
00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.974
he did a series of experiments on bioelectricity

79
00:04:08.974 --> 00:04:12.899
where he was attempting to measure

80
00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:16.045
the emotional states of people

81
00:04:16.045 --> 00:04:18.786
and also measuring sexual excitation.

82
00:04:18.786 --> 00:04:21.143
He was long before Masters and Johnson,

83
00:04:21.143 --> 00:04:24.497
Wilhelm Reich was doing this kind of research.

84
00:04:26.487 --> 00:04:30.617
It's an incredibly important body of research,

85
00:04:30.617 --> 00:04:32.389
but I'll summarize.

86
00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.732
When people expanded pleasurably,

87
00:04:36.732 --> 00:04:40.090
with like, ahh, great pleasure,

88
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.959
with one's beloved,

89
00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:45.679
the dance of life,

90
00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:49.538
this could be measured as a strong

91
00:04:49.538 --> 00:04:53.645
increase in bioelectrical charge at the skin surface.

92
00:04:53.645 --> 00:04:56.910
And, oppositely,

93
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.550
if a person had a great deal of anxiety,

94
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.416
a great deal of fear, contraction,

95
00:05:03.416 --> 00:05:05.269
which you could see, somatically,

96
00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:07.860
in the way they expressed themself,

97
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.769
if they lived a life of trauma

98
00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:11.049
since the time of their childhood,

99
00:05:11.049 --> 00:05:14.972
and had learned to restrain everything

100
00:05:14.972 --> 00:05:17.266
and to become socialized

101
00:05:17.266 --> 00:05:20.188
in a sex-negative society,

102
00:05:20.188 --> 00:05:21.980
authoritarian society,

103
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.448
then their skin surface would lack that

104
00:05:25.448 --> 00:05:26.866
bioelectrical charge.

105
00:05:26.866 --> 00:05:29.245
They would have a low, weak,

106
00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:31.421
bioelectrical charging at the skin surface

107
00:05:31.421 --> 00:05:35.804
and an incapacity in most cases for pleasurable expansion.

108
00:05:35.804 --> 00:05:39.570
And this is where Reich got the concept of

109
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.801
the psychic and somatic armoring,

110
00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:44.869
or you may hear the term "human armoring."

111
00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:46.327
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>
<v James>And this is a term</v>

112
00:05:46.327 --> 00:05:47.494
that Reich developed very early.

113
00:05:47.494 --> 00:05:48.230
<v Regina>And could you</v>

114
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.953
ahead and explain that for us?

115
00:05:49.953 --> 00:05:51.793
<v ->Well armoring is a</v>

116
00:05:51.793 --> 00:05:54.840
a combination of psychological

117
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.687
and somatic...

118
00:05:58.267 --> 00:06:00.097
It's a dynamic

119
00:06:00.097 --> 00:06:04.418
where people are restraining their impulses,

120
00:06:04.418 --> 00:06:07.181
they're restraining their reaching out for things

121
00:06:07.181 --> 00:06:10.936
that they would need, like reaching out for love,

122
00:06:10.936 --> 00:06:15.351
reaching out for the kind of life that they want,

123
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:18.721
for the kind of work that they would like to do,

124
00:06:18.721 --> 00:06:22.594
so they compromise.

125
00:06:22.594 --> 00:06:26.133
This one I will be with, but I don't really love her,

126
00:06:26.133 --> 00:06:28.897
but she gives me some sexual gratification,

127
00:06:28.897 --> 00:06:30.561
but it isn't really what I want,

128
00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:31.809
or the girl saying,

129
00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:35.696
I really want that guy but, well, so-and-so here is

130
00:06:35.696 --> 00:06:37.984
wanting to be with me,
<v Regina>Has a job.</v>

131
00:06:37.984 --> 00:06:39.264
<v James>He has a job,</v>

132
00:06:39.264 --> 00:06:42.976
all of the excuses that people have for compromising,

133
00:06:42.976 --> 00:06:45.290
their potentials.

134
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.818
Reich was the first one to talk about this,

135
00:06:47.818 --> 00:06:50.293
about the unity of psyche and soma,

136
00:06:50.293 --> 00:06:51.657
that people's character,

137
00:06:51.657 --> 00:06:55.070
their mental process came out of this larger emotional

138
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.095
energetic situation

139
00:06:59.095 --> 00:07:02.545
of their life, and today

140
00:07:02.545 --> 00:07:03.984
you see a lot of people talking about this

141
00:07:03.984 --> 00:07:06.164
in so-called mind-body issues,

142
00:07:06.164 --> 00:07:09.395
and Reich is acknowledged in many places

143
00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:11.945
as the father of these

144
00:07:11.945 --> 00:07:14.415
kinds of ways of viewing

145
00:07:14.415 --> 00:07:18.024
the life, if you will.

146
00:07:18.024 --> 00:07:20.296
And in some cases, he's not acknowledged,

147
00:07:20.296 --> 00:07:23.411
but I think, if you look at Reich's original work,

148
00:07:23.411 --> 00:07:27.229
in books like Function of the Orgasm, or Character Analysis,

149
00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:30.300
which is an interesting book, Character Analysis,

150
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.804
is now used as a teaching text in hospitals

151
00:07:33.804 --> 00:07:38.524
even the psychoanalysts will acknowledge it,

152
00:07:38.524 --> 00:07:41.756
except they'll tell you to stop at part three,

153
00:07:41.756 --> 00:07:43.462
don't read any farther, than part three.

154
00:07:43.462 --> 00:07:46.353
<v Regina>Oh, what's beyond the door there?</v>

155
00:07:46.353 --> 00:07:47.980
<v ->Part three is where he talks about</v>

156
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.472
the psychic and somatic aspects of life energy,

157
00:07:51.472 --> 00:07:54.758
and he talks about the orgone energy.

158
00:07:54.758 --> 00:07:57.030
That these biolelectical currents he was measuring,

159
00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.325
Reich eventually came to appreciate this

160
00:08:00.325 --> 00:08:02.214
as a small bioelectrical expression

161
00:08:02.214 --> 00:08:05.551
of a much more powerful energetic force in the body.

162
00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:08.923
And this is hotly controversial,

163
00:08:08.923 --> 00:08:10.992
but there are aspects of it

164
00:08:10.992 --> 00:08:13.082
that have been verified time-and-again

165
00:08:13.082 --> 00:08:16.005
by different, classically-oriented researchers.

166
00:08:16.005 --> 00:08:18.106
Harold Burr, for example,

167
00:08:18.106 --> 00:08:21.146
with the whole electrodynamic field theory,

168
00:08:21.146 --> 00:08:22.532
that was well-known in the fifties,

169
00:08:22.532 --> 00:08:24.132
not so much today.

170
00:08:24.132 --> 00:08:26.659
But he was doing similar bioelectrical measurments

171
00:08:26.659 --> 00:08:30.084
and argued that the bioelectrical fields in people's bodies

172
00:08:30.084 --> 00:08:32.505
could be measured out from their bodies

173
00:08:32.505 --> 00:08:36.227
and that it was an expression of a larger life force,

174
00:08:36.227 --> 00:08:37.241
if you will.

175
00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:40.227
There are other people who have done

176
00:08:40.227 --> 00:08:41.243
similar kinds of things,

177
00:08:41.243 --> 00:08:44.124
but Reich was one of the first, if not the first

178
00:08:44.124 --> 00:08:48.283
and his argumentation and the proofs that he gives

179
00:08:48.283 --> 00:08:51.825
later in his work, I think are quite exceptional,

180
00:08:51.825 --> 00:08:55.195
and nobody's ever really advanced significantly

181
00:08:55.195 --> 00:08:56.582
beyond them.

182
00:08:56.582 --> 00:08:58.976
<v Regina>There's so many directions, obviously,</v>

183
00:08:58.976 --> 00:09:00.342
to go with his work, and then,

184
00:09:00.342 --> 00:09:01.825
with the work you're doing now.

185
00:09:01.825 --> 00:09:04.042
From here, let's go ahead and we'll blend

186
00:09:04.042 --> 00:09:05.910
your stories together in a minute

187
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.267
and we'll look at the information.

188
00:09:08.267 --> 00:09:11.371
Now, you were a young graduate student,

189
00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:13.035
now take the story from there.

190
00:09:13.035 --> 00:09:14.176
<v James>Okay,</v>

191
00:09:14.176 --> 00:09:16.852
I was a young graduate student,

192
00:09:16.852 --> 00:09:21.166
I had gotten a degree in environmental science,

193
00:09:21.166 --> 00:09:25.044
and became deeply interested in Reich's work,

194
00:09:25.044 --> 00:09:28.891
and it was a conundrum for me because

195
00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:32.752
I really didn't want to hide and do this work secretly.

196
00:09:32.752 --> 00:09:35.974
A lot of people advised me, get your Ph.D. first,

197
00:09:35.974 --> 00:09:37.702
hide your real interests, and do this work on the side

198
00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:41.381
and don't tell anybody, cause it's too controversial,

199
00:09:41.381 --> 00:09:43.878
you'll never be able to get your degree.

200
00:09:43.878 --> 00:09:46.182
That's reasonable advice.

201
00:09:46.182 --> 00:09:48.795
In most contexts, that would be true.

202
00:09:48.795 --> 00:09:52.005
I know a lot of people who when it got known

203
00:09:52.005 --> 00:09:54.223
by their university professors that they were interested

204
00:09:54.223 --> 00:09:56.581
in this kind of stuff, their programs were halted,

205
00:09:56.581 --> 00:09:57.776
they were thrown out.

206
00:09:57.776 --> 00:09:58.671
<v Regina>Let me insert one thing</v>

207
00:09:58.671 --> 00:10:00.505
that will help explain this, too:

208
00:10:00.505 --> 00:10:04.359
Reich was arrested,

209
00:10:04.359 --> 00:10:05.899
thrown in prison,

210
00:10:05.899 --> 00:10:07.209
died in prison,

211
00:10:07.209 --> 00:10:08.394
as I understand it?
<v James>That's right.</v>

212
00:10:08.394 --> 00:10:11.956
<v Regina>His works were banned, even burned,</v>

213
00:10:11.956 --> 00:10:14.047
<v ->That's right, the Food and Drug Administration.</v>

214
00:10:14.047 --> 00:10:16.402
<v Regina>Because they threatened the establishment,</v>

215
00:10:16.402 --> 00:10:18.802
so now you come along, a few years later,

216
00:10:18.802 --> 00:10:20.403
this was in the fifties.
<v James>Yeah.</v>

217
00:10:20.403 --> 00:10:23.976
<v Regina>You come along, twenty years later or so.</v>

218
00:10:23.976 --> 00:10:26.621
<v James>Yes, in the late 1970's.</v>

219
00:10:26.621 --> 00:10:31.174
I got accepted to the University of Kansas,

220
00:10:31.174 --> 00:10:35.686
to the graduate program in geography meteorology,

221
00:10:35.686 --> 00:10:39.036
and I really wanted to study this stuff.

222
00:10:39.036 --> 00:10:42.652
My adviser there was a marvelous fellow by the name of

223
00:10:42.652 --> 00:10:46.448
Robert Nunley, Bob Nunley, he's been a president

224
00:10:46.448 --> 00:10:50.310
since those days with the ISEM group,

225
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.882
the International Scientists for Energy Medicine.

226
00:10:53.882 --> 00:10:57.446
Yeah, he's been a mover and a shaker in all kinds of

227
00:10:57.446 --> 00:11:00.506
alternative stuff, so he was my adviser,

228
00:11:00.506 --> 00:11:02.800
and he got fascinated with this also,

229
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.410
and supported me tremendously, and without his support,

230
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.215
I would have never accomplished what I did.

231
00:11:07.215 --> 00:11:11.103
But, I focused

232
00:11:11.103 --> 00:11:13.603
directly upon WIlhelm Reich's work

233
00:11:13.603 --> 00:11:17.774
for my graduate program and basically was able to show

234
00:11:17.774 --> 00:11:22.180
that parts of both his social theories,

235
00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.641
which is what he called his

236
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:25.880
"sex-economic theory of human behavior,"

237
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.419
as well as his later orgone energy theories,

238
00:11:28.419 --> 00:11:32.173
specifically with respect to atmospheric process,

239
00:11:32.173 --> 00:11:35.757
had a powerful validity, and could be used

240
00:11:35.757 --> 00:11:38.637
to make a new understanding,

241
00:11:38.637 --> 00:11:41.498
some real breakthroughs, in fact.

242
00:11:41.498 --> 00:11:44.087
<v Regina>What did you end up getting your Ph.D. in?</v>

243
00:11:44.087 --> 00:11:46.242
<v ->It's in the field of geography.</v>

244
00:11:46.242 --> 00:11:47.158
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

245
00:11:47.158 --> 00:11:48.727
<v ->Which is a very broad, interdisciplinary</v>

246
00:11:48.727 --> 00:11:50.710
kind of a science.

247
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:51.809
<v Regina>Right, it goes into some of the work</v>

248
00:11:51.809 --> 00:11:53.974
you're doing now, almost loosely speaking,

249
00:11:53.974 --> 00:11:55.681
because your work is so broad.

250
00:11:55.681 --> 00:11:56.801
<v James>Yes.</v>

251
00:11:56.801 --> 00:12:01.099
<v Regina>Okay, let's split streams here,</v>

252
00:12:01.099 --> 00:12:03.094
and first continue talking about

253
00:12:03.094 --> 00:12:05.995
what he called sex economics,

254
00:12:05.995 --> 00:12:08.619
what does that mean, sexual economics?

255
00:12:08.619 --> 00:12:11.424
and go further into that study.

256
00:12:11.424 --> 00:12:15.754
<v James>Yes, think of how a money economy functions,</v>

257
00:12:15.754 --> 00:12:17.984
where you describe the flow of money

258
00:12:17.984 --> 00:12:21.823
and how it's regulated or not regulated and moved around

259
00:12:21.823 --> 00:12:25.439
and held and reserved, and doled out,

260
00:12:25.439 --> 00:12:28.129
and used efficiently

261
00:12:28.129 --> 00:12:30.739
to increase the happiness of people,

262
00:12:30.739 --> 00:12:34.272
or hoarded and held back in the hands of a few,

263
00:12:34.272 --> 00:12:37.344
and irrespective of people's misery.

264
00:12:37.344 --> 00:12:41.482
Now transpose that way of thinking

265
00:12:41.482 --> 00:12:44.695
to the dynamics of sexual energy

266
00:12:44.695 --> 00:12:48.644
of how people use their biological energy,

267
00:12:48.644 --> 00:12:52.428
their emotional, sexual energy to reach out into the world

268
00:12:52.428 --> 00:12:56.960
for fulfillment, for happiness, for generosity, giving,

269
00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.534
receiving love and joy and happiness,

270
00:13:00.534 --> 00:13:02.528
or, the opposite, holding it back,

271
00:13:02.528 --> 00:13:06.283
being afraid, being punitive and aggressive.

272
00:13:06.283 --> 00:13:09.999
When Reich talked about sex economy,

273
00:13:09.999 --> 00:13:14.293
he's talking about the economy of human bioenergy,

274
00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:18.506
and how this works not only on the individual level

275
00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:22.890
to promote health or developing neuroses,

276
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.897
but then how that then translates out

277
00:13:25.897 --> 00:13:29.652
into the larger society in the various social institutions.

278
00:13:29.652 --> 00:13:33.311
So a social institution can be very protective

279
00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:35.668
and life affirming, or it can be something that

280
00:13:35.668 --> 00:13:39.081
demands life-negative punishments of people.

281
00:13:39.081 --> 00:13:42.418
And that's a subject that became of great interest to me

282
00:13:42.418 --> 00:13:44.488
in my own research.
<v Regina>Yes,</v>

283
00:13:44.488 --> 00:13:46.343
<v Regina>that's where I'd like to go,</v>

284
00:13:46.343 --> 00:13:47.400
because you wrote a book, it looks like a very

285
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.675
comprehensive volume, called Saharsia.

286
00:13:50.675 --> 00:13:51.891
<v James>Saharsia, yes.</v>

287
00:13:51.891 --> 00:13:56.626
<v Regina>Saharasia, and it's very stark geographical area</v>

288
00:13:56.626 --> 00:14:00.519
of the world that also contains very stark psycology

289
00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:02.962
and practices and so forth,

290
00:14:02.962 --> 00:14:05.405
but before we even go into that,

291
00:14:05.405 --> 00:14:07.431
when I'm listening to you, I'm thinking,

292
00:14:07.431 --> 00:14:11.964
well, gee, that contraction fear-based, withholding,

293
00:14:11.964 --> 00:14:14.652
which also extends to greed and so forth,

294
00:14:14.652 --> 00:14:17.244
seems to represent much of the western world right now.

295
00:14:17.244 --> 00:14:20.442
But it also represents a lot of the eastern world.

296
00:14:20.442 --> 00:14:23.003
Are we in a period of history, perhaps,

297
00:14:23.003 --> 00:14:26.630
that has been contractive by nature?

298
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.968
<v James>Well, the question is,</v>

299
00:14:29.968 --> 00:14:31.611
how did all this get started?

300
00:14:31.611 --> 00:14:33.360
I mean, we can talk about that.

301
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.485
Compare the west to the east to Africa, to whatever,

302
00:14:36.485 --> 00:14:39.781
all of the world's cultures, to a greater or lesser extent,

303
00:14:39.781 --> 00:14:43.845
have been influenced in very bad way by these patterns

304
00:14:43.845 --> 00:14:46.725
of social negation.

305
00:14:46.725 --> 00:14:48.836
The question that interested me was,

306
00:14:48.836 --> 00:14:51.034
how could it have all got started?

307
00:14:51.034 --> 00:14:55.033
So, one of the argumentations Wilhelm Reich had was

308
00:14:55.033 --> 00:14:58.169
that deserts were involved, that human beings,

309
00:14:58.169 --> 00:15:01.209
living in hard, desert environments, somehow

310
00:15:01.209 --> 00:15:04.734
developed a contractive,

311
00:15:04.734 --> 00:15:07.966
restricted, angry

312
00:15:07.966 --> 00:15:09.971
kind of way of living.

313
00:15:09.971 --> 00:15:11.230
<v Regina>It's a harsh existence.</v>

314
00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.107
<v James>Based partly on this very harsh existence,</v>

315
00:15:13.107 --> 00:15:16.371
so I thought, well, we could test this by using

316
00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:21.170
the cross-cultural data of, I found a database

317
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.018
of the standard anthropological literature of

318
00:15:24.018 --> 00:15:26.738
over 1,000 cultures, and I valuated

319
00:15:26.738 --> 00:15:28.508
each one of those cultures individually

320
00:15:28.508 --> 00:15:31.570
for various social institutions related to

321
00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.607
their treatment of babies, and children,

322
00:15:35.607 --> 00:15:37.797
adolescents, women,

323
00:15:37.797 --> 00:15:41.835
the tendencies toward social hierarchy and authoritarianism,

324
00:15:41.835 --> 00:15:46.795
and if a society was very gentle and nurturing and loving

325
00:15:46.795 --> 00:15:48.908
towards babies and children,

326
00:15:48.908 --> 00:15:52.598
and if women had more equal status or equal status,

327
00:15:52.598 --> 00:15:56.033
and you did not find this kind of aggressive hierarchy,

328
00:15:56.033 --> 00:15:59.222
with emphasis upon military glory,

329
00:15:59.222 --> 00:16:02.581
I defined those as the matristic cultures,

330
00:16:02.581 --> 00:16:05.771
the peace-oriented cultures.

331
00:16:05.771 --> 00:16:09.322
Oppositely, if a culture was hard, aggressive,

332
00:16:09.322 --> 00:16:12.618
cruel, in all of these ways, pushing women down,

333
00:16:12.618 --> 00:16:16.745
and having male dominance and glorification

334
00:16:16.745 --> 00:16:21.418
of war and violence, this I defined as the

335
00:16:21.418 --> 00:16:23.871
hard, patristic cultures.

336
00:16:23.871 --> 00:16:27.145
And then I got a latitude and longitude coordinate

337
00:16:27.145 --> 00:16:29.417
for each one of these cultures,

338
00:16:29.417 --> 00:16:31.230
and I merely plotted them on the map

339
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:33.118
to see how they would match up to

340
00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:36.979
the existing climate conditions around the world.

341
00:16:36.979 --> 00:16:39.699
And what came out of this study was that

342
00:16:39.699 --> 00:16:44.510
the very harshest desert environment in the world,

343
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:48.979
of largest geographical extent had, almost exclusively,

344
00:16:48.979 --> 00:16:53.128
the largest number of these very harsh, patristic societies,

345
00:16:53.128 --> 00:16:56.178
and this is the region stretching from North Africa

346
00:16:56.178 --> 00:16:59.037
across the Middle East, and up into Central Asia.

347
00:16:59.037 --> 00:17:02.268
I call this region Saharasia,

348
00:17:02.268 --> 00:17:05.052
to define its unique environment,

349
00:17:05.052 --> 00:17:08.571
as well as cultural characteristics.

350
00:17:08.571 --> 00:17:12.326
Now that body of work had other ramifications,

351
00:17:12.326 --> 00:17:15.964
because this large geographical territory of desert,

352
00:17:15.964 --> 00:17:20.901
simply did not exist prior to around 4000 B.C.

353
00:17:20.901 --> 00:17:24.614
Before then there was a period of very wet, lush,

354
00:17:24.614 --> 00:17:28.197
forested grassland conditions, so that,

355
00:17:28.197 --> 00:17:31.163
when you looked at the maps of this,

356
00:17:31.163 --> 00:17:33.722
the question demanded an answer.

357
00:17:33.722 --> 00:17:36.335
What was the condition like in that area

358
00:17:36.335 --> 00:17:39.141
before the desert formed?

359
00:17:39.141 --> 00:17:42.351
So I began looking at archaeological evidence

360
00:17:42.351 --> 00:17:45.242
for early violence and warfare,

361
00:17:45.242 --> 00:17:47.172
and I started making my own database,

362
00:17:47.172 --> 00:17:50.190
time and location specific of unambiguous evidence

363
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.473
for warfare and social violence,

364
00:17:52.473 --> 00:17:54.681
and I made another discovery out of this,

365
00:17:54.681 --> 00:17:58.179
is that you can only track back warfare and social violence

366
00:17:58.179 --> 00:18:02.265
to around 4000, 5000 B.C.

367
00:18:02.265 --> 00:18:05.550
There's a few examples prior to that in very early

368
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.867
phases of desert situation,

369
00:18:08.867 --> 00:18:13.048
but for the most part, it drops away to nearly nothing

370
00:18:13.048 --> 00:18:15.992
after around 4 to 5000 B.C.,

371
00:18:15.992 --> 00:18:18.722
or before that period when it very wet and lush.

372
00:18:18.722 --> 00:18:21.335
And when you start to see the first earliest signs

373
00:18:21.335 --> 00:18:24.002
of human violence and warfare,

374
00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:26.093
starts in those areas of Saharasia

375
00:18:26.093 --> 00:18:28.268
which are beginning to dry out earliest.

376
00:18:28.268 --> 00:18:32.486
And from there, there's a geographical spreading of warfare,

377
00:18:32.486 --> 00:18:34.880
social violence, chaos,

378
00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.280
destruction, in settlements,

379
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.456
you begin to see fortification walls, weapons of war,

380
00:18:40.456 --> 00:18:43.219
all the unambiguous evidence from archaeology

381
00:18:43.219 --> 00:18:46.141
beings to appear in dramatic abundance

382
00:18:46.141 --> 00:18:48.829
after that climate transition.
<v Regina>When survival</v>

383
00:18:48.829 --> 00:18:52.549
becomes the prime directive.

384
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:54.695
<v James>Where survival has become the prime directive.</v>

385
00:18:54.695 --> 00:18:58.504
You think of what we know of cultures

386
00:18:58.504 --> 00:19:00.700
that experience mass starvation,

387
00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.524
where there's no United Nations coming in

388
00:19:02.524 --> 00:19:04.007
with food supplies and so on,

389
00:19:04.007 --> 00:19:05.692
you see half the population dies,

390
00:19:05.692 --> 00:19:08.209
the family structures break apart,

391
00:19:08.209 --> 00:19:10.428
children are abandoned,

392
00:19:10.428 --> 00:19:14.918
it's like an atomic bomb has gone off in these societies,

393
00:19:14.918 --> 00:19:18.267
and after the rains come back one or two generations

394
00:19:18.267 --> 00:19:21.744
later, in some cases, the society is changed,

395
00:19:21.744 --> 00:19:25.051
so dramatically from its original soft, emotional,

396
00:19:25.051 --> 00:19:28.688
loving, kind of nurturing quality,

397
00:19:28.688 --> 00:19:32.281
it's become hard and aggressive.

398
00:19:32.281 --> 00:19:35.781
What I argue is that the mythology of our species

399
00:19:35.781 --> 00:19:38.468
in many different languages, from all around the world,

400
00:19:38.468 --> 00:19:41.464
speaks about an early period of a garden existence,

401
00:19:41.464 --> 00:19:43.257
<v James>The garden of Eden,</v>
<v Regina>The garden of Eden,</v>

402
00:19:43.257 --> 00:19:44.623
<v Regina>it's in all of the ancient literature.</v>

403
00:19:44.623 --> 00:19:46.648
<v James>It's not just in the Judeo-Christian tradition,</v>

404
00:19:46.648 --> 00:19:49.774
it's in Hindu, in, you know, you name it.

405
00:19:49.774 --> 00:19:54.456
And it seems to reflect a real-world situation

406
00:19:54.456 --> 00:19:57.827
prior to around 4 to 5000 B.C.

407
00:19:57.827 --> 00:20:00.014
Now I'm not the only one to write about this,

408
00:20:00.014 --> 00:20:02.211
Riane Eisler has written books about this,

409
00:20:02.211 --> 00:20:03.693
<v Regina>The Blade and the Chalice author,</v>

410
00:20:03.693 --> 00:20:05.155
<v James>Marija Gimbutas, to a lesser extent,</v>

411
00:20:05.155 --> 00:20:08.674
but my work is, I think it's the only global study

412
00:20:08.674 --> 00:20:10.924
with this this kind of quantitative data

413
00:20:10.924 --> 00:20:13.794
systematically looking at the question.

414
00:20:13.794 --> 00:20:14.946
<v Regina>Let me ask you, conversely,</v>

415
00:20:14.946 --> 00:20:16.621
just for our own edification,

416
00:20:16.621 --> 00:20:19.031
where are the areas of the world that are still

417
00:20:19.031 --> 00:20:21.207
that remain lush to this day?

418
00:20:21.207 --> 00:20:22.711
I mean, we can look at Southeast Asia, for example.

419
00:20:22.711 --> 00:20:25.892
Did those effects from this

420
00:20:25.892 --> 00:20:28.352
arid kind of hardening

421
00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:31.581
of the cultures, extend then even into the lush areas?

422
00:20:31.581 --> 00:20:32.950
<v James>Absolutely, abosolutely.</v>

423
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:35.508
And this is another controversy.

424
00:20:35.508 --> 00:20:38.213
I call my book Saharasia, "a marriage of heresies."

425
00:20:38.213 --> 00:20:39.365
(laughs)

426
00:20:39.365 --> 00:20:43.333
As part of the dynamic of the spreading of violence,

427
00:20:43.333 --> 00:20:46.234
you see Europe gets invaded and overrun

428
00:20:46.234 --> 00:20:49.732
by tribal groups coming out of Central Asian deserts.

429
00:20:49.732 --> 00:20:54.116
You think of the early civilizations of the Etruscans

430
00:20:54.116 --> 00:20:57.753
and the Dorian Greeks, and all kinds of invaders

431
00:20:57.753 --> 00:20:59.865
who sweep over Europe, one group

432
00:20:59.865 --> 00:21:01.753
after the other after the other

433
00:21:01.753 --> 00:21:04.483
making things more violent and chaotic.

434
00:21:04.483 --> 00:21:06.019
Then in China, it's the same,

435
00:21:06.019 --> 00:21:08.812
the Shang Chinese, then the Chao, then all kinds of groups

436
00:21:08.812 --> 00:21:12.621
invading out of the deserts into mainland China,

437
00:21:12.621 --> 00:21:16.312
and this peaceful kind of elegant village life

438
00:21:16.312 --> 00:21:19.704
which was actually very artistic and developing.

439
00:21:19.704 --> 00:21:21.250
<v Regina>And Southeast Asia, beautiful.</v>

440
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:22.551
<v James>Gets overrun progressively,</v>

441
00:21:22.551 --> 00:21:25.122
and you have the big emperors.

442
00:21:25.122 --> 00:21:27.810
We could argue they still do with the Communists.

443
00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:30.146
Africa, the same.

444
00:21:30.146 --> 00:21:33.378
The relatively, or the peaceful societies

445
00:21:33.378 --> 00:21:35.873
of sub-Saharan Africa are being overrun

446
00:21:35.873 --> 00:21:39.256
by tall warrior-types, the Bantu speakers

447
00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:43.798
Where you begin to see patriarchal, tribal existence,

448
00:21:43.798 --> 00:21:47.925
which, it's been complicated by European Colonialism

449
00:21:47.925 --> 00:21:49.750
and the legacy of slavery, absolutely

450
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:52.694
but there's this family structure aspect

451
00:21:52.694 --> 00:21:55.043
that nobody wants to talk about,

452
00:21:55.043 --> 00:21:57.966
which gives rise to all kinds of social violence

453
00:21:57.966 --> 00:21:59.401
there as well.

454
00:21:59.401 --> 00:22:01.507
Then you have the problem of

455
00:22:01.507 --> 00:22:05.347
ocean voyaging groups,

456
00:22:05.347 --> 00:22:08.497
and what I found is that

457
00:22:08.497 --> 00:22:10.677
the scholars who are arguing

458
00:22:10.677 --> 00:22:14.285
for pre-Columbian contacts, pre-Columbian contact theory,

459
00:22:14.285 --> 00:22:16.410
for the origins of some of these groups like,

460
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:19.790
Maya, Inca, Aztec, and so on,

461
00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:23.119
these are exactly the places that my Saharasia maps also

462
00:22:23.119 --> 00:22:25.518
give evidence along this line.

463
00:22:25.518 --> 00:22:26.958
<v Regina>I was just going to ask you about that.</v>

464
00:22:26.958 --> 00:22:29.155
<v James>So, the social violence that we find</v>

465
00:22:29.155 --> 00:22:31.811
in the New World, first of all, is at a much lower level

466
00:22:31.811 --> 00:22:32.995
among the Native Americans

467
00:22:32.995 --> 00:22:35.022
than what it is in the Old World.

468
00:22:35.022 --> 00:22:37.176
The Native Americans, by-and-large,

469
00:22:37.176 --> 00:22:40.695
people often say "Dances With Wolves" you know,

470
00:22:40.695 --> 00:22:44.920
if you remember, Dances With Wolves had peaceful

471
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.892
Indian cultures, but it also had a couple of

472
00:22:46.892 --> 00:22:49.794
violent ones, really bloody massacre

473
00:22:49.794 --> 00:22:53.879
and that seems to be what the New World had,

474
00:22:53.879 --> 00:22:58.626
with by-and-large mostly very matristic,

475
00:22:58.626 --> 00:23:01.089
low-violence level cultures,

476
00:23:01.089 --> 00:23:05.537
but with certain areas where you had these invader groups,

477
00:23:05.537 --> 00:23:08.545
that came in from the Old World before Columbus,

478
00:23:08.545 --> 00:23:13.259
and created these pyramid-building cultures

479
00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:15.329
where they committed human sacrifice

480
00:23:15.329 --> 00:23:17.302
and all kinds of things like this.

481
00:23:17.302 --> 00:23:18.923
Of course, when Columbus came,

482
00:23:18.923 --> 00:23:23.455
another wave came, especially with the Spanish,

483
00:23:23.455 --> 00:23:26.101
who were quite brutal.

484
00:23:26.101 --> 00:23:28.010
<v Regina>And they had the Moorish influence as well,</v>

485
00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:30.485
in terms of their own culture, right?

486
00:23:30.485 --> 00:23:33.557
<v James>Well, the Spanish lived under 400 years</v>

487
00:23:33.557 --> 00:23:36.255
of Moorish invasion.

488
00:23:36.255 --> 00:23:37.290
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

489
00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:40.522
<v James>Before them, Spain was not quite so harsh.</v>

490
00:23:40.522 --> 00:23:41.459
<v Regina>Exactly.</v>

491
00:23:41.459 --> 00:23:44.501
<v ->After that, what was it, in 1491,</v>

492
00:23:44.501 --> 00:23:47.212
when then ejected the Moors, and in 1492,

493
00:23:47.212 --> 00:23:49.310
the New World is discovered

494
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:50.857
with all the mythology about the cities of gold,

495
00:23:50.857 --> 00:23:54.899
so all these conquistadors, a whole caste of warriors,

496
00:23:54.899 --> 00:23:57.010
What are we gonna do now that we've kicked out the Moors?

497
00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:59.315
Well, let's go to the New World!

498
00:23:59.315 --> 00:24:02.967
Off they went and created havoc there as well.

499
00:24:02.967 --> 00:24:06.936
The history of the world is,

500
00:24:06.936 --> 00:24:09.702
when you talk about it like this,

501
00:24:09.702 --> 00:24:11.206
it's another way of looking at it,

502
00:24:11.206 --> 00:24:13.116
because we're looking at the status of women,

503
00:24:13.116 --> 00:24:15.697
we're looking at the treatment of children, and babies,

504
00:24:15.697 --> 00:24:17.859
about the sexual lives of people,

505
00:24:17.859 --> 00:24:21.978
and how that gives rise to social violence and warfare.

506
00:24:21.978 --> 00:24:24.400
<v Regina>And contraction, energetically.</v>

507
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.654
<v ->And energetic contraction, yes, the whole</v>

508
00:24:26.654 --> 00:24:30.494
I mean, people become contracted on a social-wide basis,

509
00:24:30.494 --> 00:24:33.492
just as you can have dysfunctional families

510
00:24:33.492 --> 00:24:36.649
with an alcoholic father, a miserable marriage

511
00:24:36.649 --> 00:24:38.291
between the mother and the father,

512
00:24:38.291 --> 00:24:41.171
and the mother is neglectful and angry all the time,

513
00:24:41.171 --> 00:24:43.571
and the children are fearful and withdrawn,

514
00:24:43.571 --> 00:24:47.272
and they're not thriving very well emotionally

515
00:24:47.272 --> 00:24:48.851
or intellectually,

516
00:24:48.851 --> 00:24:51.890
you can have entire cultures that fall into that

517
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:55.282
situation of dysfunctional cultures,

518
00:24:55.282 --> 00:24:57.394
and this is, of course, a terrible taboo,

519
00:24:57.394 --> 00:24:59.655
you're not supposed to talk about other cultures like this,

520
00:24:59.655 --> 00:25:01.767
because we begin to have,

521
00:25:01.767 --> 00:25:04.242
if you begin to make so-called value judgments.

522
00:25:04.242 --> 00:25:06.214
Well, I think it is important

523
00:25:06.214 --> 00:25:08.039
that you make these kind of value judgments.

524
00:25:08.039 --> 00:25:12.455
If you remember, well, none of us were alive at this time,

525
00:25:12.455 --> 00:25:17.393
but during the World War II period, and immediately after,

526
00:25:17.393 --> 00:25:20.241
the scholars of the day tried to understand

527
00:25:20.241 --> 00:25:21.926
what the hell went on with Germany,

528
00:25:21.926 --> 00:25:24.240
where this high-technology culture

529
00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.758
of great intellectual sophistication,

530
00:25:26.758 --> 00:25:27.856
<v Regina>And artistic.</v>

531
00:25:27.856 --> 00:25:31.397
<v James>A great culture of art and science,</v>

532
00:25:31.397 --> 00:25:33.509
collapsed into this fascism, what went on?

533
00:25:33.509 --> 00:25:37.029
So you had what they called "national character studies."

534
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:40.175
Today that is taboo.

535
00:25:40.175 --> 00:25:42.106
Nobody studies national character anymore,

536
00:25:42.106 --> 00:25:45.135
because everything has to be equalized.

537
00:25:45.135 --> 00:25:48.078
And I ran into this in the universities,

538
00:25:48.078 --> 00:25:50.799
because my Saharasia work was the antithesis of that,

539
00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:52.505
It brought back this whole issue of

540
00:25:52.505 --> 00:25:56.425
making careful judgments about

541
00:25:56.425 --> 00:25:58.174
how people raise their kids

542
00:25:58.174 --> 00:26:01.607
and what influenced the larger society in terms of

543
00:26:01.607 --> 00:26:03.742
the potentials for violence.

544
00:26:03.742 --> 00:26:07.424
So this kind of work is talked about more outside

545
00:26:07.424 --> 00:26:09.970
of the universities than within them, unfortunately.

546
00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:14.418
because the universities... they're not very tolerant

547
00:26:14.418 --> 00:26:16.860
towards this kind of discussion,

548
00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:17.831
anymore than they are...

549
00:26:17.831 --> 00:26:19.281
<v Regina>Because it's not politically, P.C.</v>

550
00:26:19.281 --> 00:26:21.351
<v James>It's very un-P.C., isn't it?</v>

551
00:26:21.351 --> 00:26:23.377
<v Regina>So, why did you go for it?</v>

552
00:26:23.377 --> 00:26:25.905
I want to know what you know.

553
00:26:25.905 --> 00:26:29.595
<v James>Okay, well, I did that work,</v>

554
00:26:29.595 --> 00:26:32.912
but I also did another bit of heretical work,

555
00:26:32.912 --> 00:26:36.368
while I was still in the universities, and that is...

556
00:26:36.368 --> 00:26:39.899
It comes out of my interest in deserts, and desertification,

557
00:26:39.899 --> 00:26:41.733
the whole issue of spreading deserts, because,

558
00:26:41.733 --> 00:26:44.186
<v Regina>We're in that era now.</v>

559
00:26:44.186 --> 00:26:46.928
<v James>This was my classical research work, was deserts,</v>

560
00:26:46.928 --> 00:26:49.957
and what could you do to green deserts?

561
00:26:49.957 --> 00:26:52.005
And there's this guy, Wilhelm Reich,

562
00:26:52.005 --> 00:26:55.066
and he's controversial enough on Sigmund Freud

563
00:26:55.066 --> 00:26:56.975
and psychoanalysis, his sex economic work,

564
00:26:56.975 --> 00:26:58.234
if he had just stopped there,

565
00:26:58.234 --> 00:27:00.143
his name would be written into history

566
00:27:00.143 --> 00:27:01.327
in a very positive way,

567
00:27:01.327 --> 00:27:04.761
but late in his life, he's doing all this work on bioenergy,

568
00:27:04.761 --> 00:27:07.321
and orgone energy, and the accumulator,

569
00:27:07.321 --> 00:27:10.158
orgone accumulator, and he gets into trouble

570
00:27:10.158 --> 00:27:11.481
with the Food and Drug administration,

571
00:27:11.481 --> 00:27:13.550
and they burn his books and throw him in jail.

572
00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:14.915
Hey, I'm curious!

573
00:27:14.915 --> 00:27:17.560
I'm the kind of guy if I hear it's been banned in Boston,

574
00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.706
I wanna know why is it banned in Boston?

575
00:27:20.706 --> 00:27:24.461
So then the most outrageous thing,

576
00:27:24.461 --> 00:27:27.832
outrageous in a good way, I would say,

577
00:27:27.832 --> 00:27:29.805
that Reich was claiming was that

578
00:27:29.805 --> 00:27:33.463
this energy that's in out bodies extends out

579
00:27:33.463 --> 00:27:35.331
into the atmosphere.

580
00:27:35.331 --> 00:27:38.540
There's a field of this energy surrounding the Earth,

581
00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.721
and it has variations in it,

582
00:27:42.721 --> 00:27:45.346
in the way that it moves,

583
00:27:45.346 --> 00:27:48.843
it's a pulsatory energy continuum.

584
00:27:48.843 --> 00:27:50.850
He says it goes out into space,

585
00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:53.633
like the old ether theories of 19th century physics,

586
00:27:53.633 --> 00:27:56.887
And one of the devices that he developed

587
00:27:56.887 --> 00:27:59.083
which led him to this conclusion,

588
00:27:59.083 --> 00:28:01.537
is called the cloud buster.

589
00:28:01.537 --> 00:28:03.445
So I'm looking at this and saying, cloud buster,

590
00:28:03.445 --> 00:28:05.280
wow, that's fascinating,

591
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:09.013
here I know some of Reich's other work is true,

592
00:28:09.013 --> 00:28:10.678
because I've tested it out myself,

593
00:28:10.678 --> 00:28:12.756
I also tested the orgone energy accumulator,

594
00:28:12.756 --> 00:28:14.293
which we can talk about,

595
00:28:14.293 --> 00:28:16.373
but I tested out cloud busters, as well,

596
00:28:16.373 --> 00:28:18.442
as part of my university research,

597
00:28:18.442 --> 00:28:20.009
I built one of these devices,

598
00:28:20.009 --> 00:28:22.996
I went to some of the scholars in the United States

599
00:28:22.996 --> 00:28:27.495
that had studied with Reich, and I studied with them,

600
00:28:27.495 --> 00:28:29.584
so I would get it right,

601
00:28:29.584 --> 00:28:32.624
and I built one of these devices

602
00:28:32.624 --> 00:28:33.830
and we tested it out

603
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:36.869
and used the database of a weather

604
00:28:36.869 --> 00:28:39.515
precipitation and cloud-cover data

605
00:28:39.515 --> 00:28:40.933
from the state of Kansas,

606
00:28:40.933 --> 00:28:43.824
and proved that this device actually could influence

607
00:28:43.824 --> 00:28:48.005
the weather over a large, statewide region.

608
00:28:48.505 --> 00:28:52.204
And this was a mind-blower, because this was

609
00:28:52.204 --> 00:28:55.244
as big a controversy for physics and meteorology

610
00:28:55.244 --> 00:28:59.329
as the other stuff was for sociology and psychology.

611
00:29:02.939 --> 00:29:05.867
So that work I continued with privately,

612
00:29:05.867 --> 00:29:09.108
because I tried to get funding and so forth,

613
00:29:09.108 --> 00:29:12.383
and it was difficult.

614
00:29:12.383 --> 00:29:15.395
It's hard to say what led

615
00:29:15.395 --> 00:29:17.555
to my basic excommunication

616
00:29:17.555 --> 00:29:19.088
from the academic world.

617
00:29:19.088 --> 00:29:21.645
<v Regina>Sounds like a bit of everything.</v>

618
00:29:21.645 --> 00:29:24.994
<v James>Combined with verifying Reich's sex-economic work,</v>

619
00:29:24.994 --> 00:29:28.247
with Saharasia, and then getting positive results

620
00:29:28.247 --> 00:29:29.260
on the cloud buster,

621
00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:32.065
see, a lot of my colleges thought, well, Demeo,

622
00:29:32.065 --> 00:29:34.519
he's just doing another one of his crazy things,

623
00:29:34.519 --> 00:29:36.383
he'll test the cloud buster and he'll show

624
00:29:36.383 --> 00:29:38.600
that it doesn't work.

625
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.382
I mean, I've always been an honest academic,

626
00:29:40.382 --> 00:29:42.921
I'm gonna go with what the data says,

627
00:29:42.921 --> 00:29:45.054
and I got positive results,

628
00:29:45.054 --> 00:29:47.049
so this stunned a lot of people.

629
00:29:47.049 --> 00:29:50.174
I had supporters, I had detractors,

630
00:29:50.174 --> 00:29:52.679
and for about 10 years, I continued

631
00:29:52.679 --> 00:29:55.048
teaching in different universities.

632
00:29:55.048 --> 00:29:59.090
After I left University of Kansas, I was teaching

633
00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:02.716
at Illinois State University, and a few years later

634
00:30:02.716 --> 00:30:05.575
at the University of Miami in South Florida,

635
00:30:05.575 --> 00:30:08.988
then at the University of Northern Iowa,

636
00:30:08.988 --> 00:30:11.122
and at that point it was clear,

637
00:30:11.122 --> 00:30:12.508
I was one of these guys that,

638
00:30:12.508 --> 00:30:14.151
thank you for your service,

639
00:30:14.151 --> 00:30:16.828
you've taught here for three years, adios,

640
00:30:16.828 --> 00:30:18.641
and then go to the next place,

641
00:30:18.641 --> 00:30:19.996
and you work there for another three years,

642
00:30:19.996 --> 00:30:22.844
and you don't get the tenure-track positions

643
00:30:22.844 --> 00:30:24.731
if you're doing controversial work,

644
00:30:24.731 --> 00:30:26.929
so I decided at some point I should

645
00:30:26.929 --> 00:30:30.832
devote myself through my own institute,

646
00:30:30.832 --> 00:30:32.635
which is what I did in 1988,

647
00:30:32.635 --> 00:30:34.523
I stepped out of the university system

648
00:30:34.523 --> 00:30:37.211
and just began going for my own institute.

649
00:30:37.211 --> 00:30:41.136
Now, it's interesting, right at that time,

650
00:30:41.136 --> 00:30:44.848
some of my work began to be published,

651
00:30:44.848 --> 00:30:48.058
and got to be known,

652
00:30:48.058 --> 00:30:52.655
I was presenting my work to some of the scholarly societies,

653
00:30:52.655 --> 00:30:55.866
like the Association of Arid Lands Studies,

654
00:30:55.866 --> 00:30:57.775
and the American Association of Geographers,

655
00:30:57.775 --> 00:31:01.615
and through this network of different people,

656
00:31:01.615 --> 00:31:03.790
and working outside the universities,

657
00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:06.379
I was asked

658
00:31:06.379 --> 00:31:10.768
to undertake some research projects,

659
00:31:10.768 --> 00:31:13.173
some application projects for drought abatement

660
00:31:13.173 --> 00:31:15.365
in different parts of the world.

661
00:31:15.365 --> 00:31:19.745
I had done a study in Arizona

662
00:31:19.745 --> 00:31:22.145
applying Reich's cloud buster

663
00:31:22.145 --> 00:31:23.781
in 1989, for example,

664
00:31:23.781 --> 00:31:26.991
and it was on five pre-announced dates,

665
00:31:26.991 --> 00:31:29.497
went into Arizona, used this cloud busting device

666
00:31:29.497 --> 00:31:31.098
for a couple of days, then went home,

667
00:31:31.098 --> 00:31:33.434
and after a whole summer of doing this,

668
00:31:33.434 --> 00:31:35.951
we took the data, aggregated it for something like

669
00:31:35.951 --> 00:31:38.894
4 or 500 rain stations in the region,

670
00:31:38.894 --> 00:31:41.498
and it was able to show

671
00:31:41.498 --> 00:31:44.514
that the rainfall

672
00:31:44.514 --> 00:31:47.364
is going along like so and we do our cloud busting work,

673
00:31:47.364 --> 00:31:49.742
and there's a leap upwards, a doubling

674
00:31:49.742 --> 00:31:52.014
of the amount of rain for about a week

675
00:31:52.014 --> 00:31:54.052
after each one of these tests.

676
00:31:54.052 --> 00:31:56.932
So we got a rainfall doubling effect over immense areas.

677
00:31:56.932 --> 00:31:58.767
<v Regina>And the rainfall is monsoon season in Arizona,</v>

678
00:31:58.767 --> 00:32:00.408
so this is when you'd be doing that,

679
00:32:00.408 --> 00:32:01.838
that's why the summer there, right?

680
00:32:01.838 --> 00:32:03.929
That's when there's a natural accumulation?

681
00:32:03.929 --> 00:32:06.340
<v James>Starting from May through...</v>

682
00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.579
May, June, July, August,

683
00:32:08.579 --> 00:32:09.753
about through September.

684
00:32:09.753 --> 00:32:11.608
<v Regina>Which, that's the perfect time to do it.</v>

685
00:32:11.608 --> 00:32:13.145
So you could really see the steps.

686
00:32:13.145 --> 00:32:15.095
<v James>So you could see the effects,</v>

687
00:32:15.095 --> 00:32:17.560
it wasn't really trying to break a drought,

688
00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:21.443
just so much as to see if the rainfall statistics there

689
00:32:21.443 --> 00:32:23.896
would match what we got in Kansas,

690
00:32:23.896 --> 00:32:25.741
working in a desert region

691
00:32:25.741 --> 00:32:29.623
in the desert Southwest, and it did.

692
00:32:29.623 --> 00:32:32.087
So this was a breakthrough because it showed

693
00:32:32.087 --> 00:32:34.722
the same technology that would work

694
00:32:34.722 --> 00:32:37.024
in relatively wet conditions of Kansas

695
00:32:37.024 --> 00:32:39.894
would also work in dry lands like Arizona.

696
00:32:39.894 --> 00:32:43.616
And nobody has, cloud seeding generally won't work

697
00:32:43.616 --> 00:32:46.133
in a dry land area if you don't have

698
00:32:46.133 --> 00:32:47.637
pre-existing cloud cover.

699
00:32:47.637 --> 00:32:51.233
So then I got an invitation from

700
00:32:51.233 --> 00:32:55.168
the government of Israel,

701
00:32:55.168 --> 00:32:58.015
so I was asked by the Israeli government

702
00:32:58.015 --> 00:33:00.330
during a period of drought,

703
00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:02.143
they had about three years of drought,

704
00:33:02.143 --> 00:33:06.367
with the lowest level of their main reservoir,

705
00:33:06.367 --> 00:33:09.289
Lake Kinneret, which we call the Sea of Galilee,

706
00:33:09.289 --> 00:33:12.585
was down to about one centimeter above the red line,

707
00:33:12.585 --> 00:33:15.753
which means they only have that much water left

708
00:33:15.753 --> 00:33:18.355
before they were no longer allowed to take water out

709
00:33:18.355 --> 00:33:20.137
so it would have been a catastrophe

710
00:33:20.137 --> 00:33:21.395
for their agriculture,

711
00:33:21.395 --> 00:33:25.384
so they asked me to come there and try this device out,

712
00:33:25.384 --> 00:33:29.626
which I did, and we worked it for about,

713
00:33:29.626 --> 00:33:33.970
about ten days on and off at different stations in Israel,

714
00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:37.235
and then with a final operation that was

715
00:33:37.235 --> 00:33:39.390
designed to bring in the jet stream

716
00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:41.971
and big pulses of moisture,

717
00:33:41.971 --> 00:33:44.735
and within a couple of days,

718
00:33:44.735 --> 00:33:47.166
they had the biggest rainstorm they'd had

719
00:33:47.166 --> 00:33:50.218
in those three-year periods,

720
00:33:50.218 --> 00:33:52.828
and one of the things

721
00:33:52.828 --> 00:33:54.314
that this cloud busting device does is,

722
00:33:54.314 --> 00:33:58.421
restores what Reich called "atmospheric pulsation"

723
00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:02.911
so you use it and then it's like acupuncture,

724
00:34:02.911 --> 00:34:06.142
you get the energy flow restored,

725
00:34:06.142 --> 00:34:08.947
and there's a natural pulsation that gets set up,

726
00:34:08.947 --> 00:34:13.640
of rain, dry, rain, dry, like in nature,

727
00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:18.003
it restores the natural energetic pulsation,

728
00:34:18.003 --> 00:34:20.381
and the rains come afterwards.

729
00:34:20.381 --> 00:34:23.229
And that's what happened, throughout the whole rainy season

730
00:34:23.229 --> 00:34:27.634
of that year, '91, which was their wintertime period

731
00:34:27.634 --> 00:34:29.607
when the get all their rains,

732
00:34:29.607 --> 00:34:31.741
they had these immense pulses of rain fall

733
00:34:31.741 --> 00:34:35.303
and it broke all their records going back 100 years.

734
00:34:35.303 --> 00:34:38.087
They had more rain during that one wintertime period

735
00:34:38.087 --> 00:34:42.332
than they had previously in 100 years of record keeping.

736
00:34:42.332 --> 00:34:45.788
Lake Kinneret filled to overflowing,

737
00:34:45.788 --> 00:34:49.180
they had to open the dam that allowed the sweetwater

738
00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:52.635
to go into the Dead Sea, which, in Israel, is unheard of

739
00:34:52.635 --> 00:34:54.907
because that is a so-called waste of water,

740
00:34:54.907 --> 00:34:57.413
but they had to because otherwise, it would have flooded

741
00:34:57.413 --> 00:34:59.974
the coastal cities of Tiberius and other villages

742
00:34:59.974 --> 00:35:01.595
around the lake, so they opened the dam

743
00:35:01.595 --> 00:35:04.240
and let the water go as it did by nature

744
00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.365
years before irrigation agriculture got started.

745
00:35:07.365 --> 00:35:09.136
And it was an immense breakthrough,

746
00:35:09.136 --> 00:35:12.037
I thought, now we're gonna get some support,

747
00:35:12.037 --> 00:35:14.682
some serious openness, we can start applying this,

748
00:35:14.682 --> 00:35:16.571
we'll green the Negev.

749
00:35:16.571 --> 00:35:17.444
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

750
00:35:17.444 --> 00:35:19.460
<v James>It didn't happen,</v>

751
00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.999
because the meteorologists were against it.

752
00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:25.391
They claim, they're like classical medical doctors are

753
00:35:25.391 --> 00:35:27.460
to alternative medical treatments, you know?

754
00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.126
The meteorologists, they said, well,

755
00:35:30.126 --> 00:35:32.280
This, your cloud busting had nothing to do with it,

756
00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.342
it had to do with Mount Pinatubo

757
00:35:35.342 --> 00:35:38.083
erupting on the other side of the Earth six months earlier.

758
00:35:38.083 --> 00:35:39.854
<v Regina>Oh, well.</v>

759
00:35:39.854 --> 00:35:42.616
<v James>Oh well, okay, so I got another good data set</v>

760
00:35:42.616 --> 00:35:44.611
and we showed the results,

761
00:35:44.611 --> 00:35:46.371
I published a good paper about it,

762
00:35:46.371 --> 00:35:50.274
and I had two other major projects

763
00:35:50.274 --> 00:35:54.071
that came in the '90's, one was in Namibia,

764
00:35:54.071 --> 00:35:57.570
where another three or four year drought ongoing,

765
00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:00.438
the whole Southern part of Africa affected,

766
00:36:00.438 --> 00:36:02.914
there, they were looking at starvation.

767
00:36:02.914 --> 00:36:04.278
<v Regina>Same results?</v>

768
00:36:04.278 --> 00:36:06.241
<v James>Same kind of results, very positive,</v>

769
00:36:06.241 --> 00:36:08.129
breakthrough in rains,

770
00:36:11.539 --> 00:36:16.362
and the guy who ran their meteorology department was a...

771
00:36:16.372 --> 00:36:20.742
Afrikaaner, Christian guy,

772
00:36:20.742 --> 00:36:23.294
a boor type,

773
00:36:23.294 --> 00:36:27.177
very fundamentalistic fellow,

774
00:36:27.177 --> 00:36:29.491
and when I went into the office to meet him,

775
00:36:29.491 --> 00:36:32.361
and to introduce myself,

776
00:36:32.361 --> 00:36:33.907
because he knew that we were traveling around,

777
00:36:33.907 --> 00:36:35.976
we're again, invited by the Namibian government,

778
00:36:35.976 --> 00:36:38.984
with help from some of my friends in Germany

779
00:36:38.984 --> 00:36:42.849
that made the contacts for me.

780
00:36:42.849 --> 00:36:46.310
When I went into his office, he said,

781
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:50.213
"'Only God can make it rain, get the hell out of my office!"

782
00:36:50.213 --> 00:36:51.984
(laughs)

783
00:36:51.984 --> 00:36:54.012
<v Regina>Maybe you're in closer contact with God!</v>

784
00:36:54.012 --> 00:36:57.221
<v James>So, okay, I've got another good day to set,</v>

785
00:36:57.221 --> 00:36:59.258
publish another couple of papers on the subject,

786
00:36:59.258 --> 00:37:01.818
and a few years roll by, and

787
00:37:01.818 --> 00:37:04.784
I'm doing other things, you know,

788
00:37:04.784 --> 00:37:06.874
if the world doesn't want this, okay,

789
00:37:06.874 --> 00:37:10.012
I can live with it, I got other things to do,

790
00:37:10.012 --> 00:37:15.012
but then, I got called by, in 1993,

791
00:37:15.161 --> 00:37:18.723
I got contact with the government of Eritrea,

792
00:37:18.723 --> 00:37:21.626
through a friend who was the son

793
00:37:21.626 --> 00:37:25.833
of the former Italian ambassador to Eritrea.

794
00:37:28.047 --> 00:37:30.628
They had made contacts with the meteorologist there

795
00:37:30.628 --> 00:37:32.558
who was all in favor of giving us a try,

796
00:37:32.558 --> 00:37:34.765
because Eritrea was a newly formed nation,

797
00:37:34.765 --> 00:37:39.075
which had been at civil war far 30 years with Ethiopia.

798
00:37:39.075 --> 00:37:42.531
And they broke away, formed their own new nation,

799
00:37:42.531 --> 00:37:44.259
and this wasn't going to go anywhere

800
00:37:44.259 --> 00:37:47.064
in terms of social development because not only the poverty,

801
00:37:47.064 --> 00:37:51.149
the grinding poverty there, but 30 years of drought.

802
00:37:51.149 --> 00:37:53.954
How are you going to get your agriculture going?

803
00:37:53.954 --> 00:37:56.877
It's just a devastation.

804
00:37:56.877 --> 00:38:00.333
So I was asked, what could be done?

805
00:38:00.333 --> 00:38:03.095
And this time I said, okay, I will come and do this,

806
00:38:03.095 --> 00:38:06.326
but I want your word, if we get positive results,

807
00:38:06.326 --> 00:38:09.324
that you will commit to a five year research program.

808
00:38:09.324 --> 00:38:11.446
We'll do this for five years, and then

809
00:38:11.446 --> 00:38:13.025
we'll assess the data,

810
00:38:13.025 --> 00:38:16.662
then we can go to some large international body

811
00:38:16.662 --> 00:38:19.606
and talk about integrating this with something

812
00:38:19.606 --> 00:38:21.782
like the United Nations Environmental Program,

813
00:38:21.782 --> 00:38:23.168
or some big agency, because this is,

814
00:38:23.168 --> 00:38:26.838
you could green the world's deserts, for God's sakes,

815
00:38:26.838 --> 00:38:29.750
this is a breakthrough, a major breakthrough.

816
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:33.707
So okay, we get some private funding,

817
00:38:33.707 --> 00:38:35.967
because Eritrea doesn't have money.

818
00:38:35.967 --> 00:38:37.728
We get some private funding,

819
00:38:37.728 --> 00:38:41.290
and we go to Eritrea, we have a whole team of people,

820
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:44.757
we build the devices there, we go out into the field,

821
00:38:44.757 --> 00:38:48.820
and basically, we end a 30 year drought cycle,

822
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:53.087
it's right in the data of the Climate Data Analysis Center

823
00:38:53.087 --> 00:38:54.292
of NOAA, you know,

824
00:38:54.292 --> 00:38:57.299
you have 30 years of drought below normal levels of drought,

825
00:38:57.299 --> 00:38:59.209
and then here's our little cloud busting operation,

826
00:38:59.209 --> 00:39:02.515
up comes the rain for the first time in 30 years

827
00:39:02.515 --> 00:39:04.125
above normal.

828
00:39:04.125 --> 00:39:08.531
And what we saw when we were there, was, of course,

829
00:39:08.531 --> 00:39:11.272
we got it all on video, and it's all...

830
00:39:11.272 --> 00:39:14.280
Some future documentary will be made about all this,

831
00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.477
but it broke through the rains,

832
00:39:16.477 --> 00:39:18.909
and immense rainfall,

833
00:39:18.909 --> 00:39:20.594
like they had not seen.

834
00:39:20.594 --> 00:39:23.282
The older Eritreans said, "Ah, I remember,

835
00:39:23.282 --> 00:39:25.554
"this is the way it was 30 years ago

836
00:39:25.554 --> 00:39:27.911
"when I was a young kid."

837
00:39:27.911 --> 00:39:31.591
What I'm talking about is not isolated thunderstorms

838
00:39:31.591 --> 00:39:34.214
that come typically in a desert and dump

839
00:39:34.214 --> 00:39:36.289
and then they're gone,

840
00:39:36.289 --> 00:39:40.915
but big, massive rain fronts that cover huge areas,

841
00:39:40.915 --> 00:39:44.891
and drizzle, and rain, and drizzle, and rain

842
00:39:44.891 --> 00:39:46.575
all day long.

843
00:39:46.575 --> 00:39:48.058
That's the kind of rains they got

844
00:39:48.058 --> 00:39:50.030
following our operations.

845
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:53.625
So the Eritreans, their eyes are like this,

846
00:39:53.625 --> 00:39:54.947
and they wanna know more,

847
00:39:54.947 --> 00:39:57.764
and they decide, okay, even though we're a poor country,

848
00:39:57.764 --> 00:39:59.449
we're going to pay your expenses,

849
00:39:59.449 --> 00:40:02.051
and we'll have you do it here for the five years.

850
00:40:02.051 --> 00:40:05.251
And they agreed to it, and I was happy.

851
00:40:05.251 --> 00:40:07.842
So we went back for three more years

852
00:40:07.842 --> 00:40:11.224
and we did it, again, the same results,

853
00:40:11.224 --> 00:40:12.963
each of these years.

854
00:40:12.963 --> 00:40:15.608
Amazing, wonderful rains.

855
00:40:15.608 --> 00:40:19.106
Their agriculture popped way up.

856
00:40:19.106 --> 00:40:22.552
In fact, one of the statistics was

857
00:40:22.552 --> 00:40:26.818
in the year before we started doing our work,

858
00:40:26.818 --> 00:40:30.635
they had spent $150,000,000 a year on food import.

859
00:40:30.635 --> 00:40:34.329
It had dropped to about $10,000,000

860
00:40:34.329 --> 00:40:36.867
on the years when we had finished.

861
00:40:36.867 --> 00:40:41.521
Then, unfortunately,

862
00:40:43.019 --> 00:40:45.943
the war with Ethiopia came back again.

863
00:40:45.943 --> 00:40:48.032
And you had Ethiopian jets bombing

864
00:40:48.032 --> 00:40:49.717
the Asmara airport,

865
00:40:49.717 --> 00:40:52.202
and they were looking around for targets of opportunity,

866
00:40:52.202 --> 00:40:53.195
and I don't know if you know

867
00:40:53.195 --> 00:40:54.433
what a cloud buster looks like,

868
00:40:54.433 --> 00:40:57.151
but it looks like a piece of artillery,

869
00:40:57.151 --> 00:40:58.698
it's got these long tubes,

870
00:40:58.698 --> 00:41:01.589
and it's pulled behind a vehicle on a trailer.

871
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:05.908
And I got very worried our team might get shot up,

872
00:41:05.908 --> 00:41:08.511
or something, so

873
00:41:08.511 --> 00:41:11.050
they didn't have have money to pay for our expenses anymore,

874
00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:13.810
anyhow, we went one last year on our own money,

875
00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:16.928
which was just a...

876
00:41:16.928 --> 00:41:20.874
Because we felt we wanted to finish this work,

877
00:41:22.254 --> 00:41:26.610
so the project, I pulled the plug on the project in 1999

878
00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:30.153
And that was our last year.

879
00:41:30.153 --> 00:41:32.573
And we were feeling horribly depressed,

880
00:41:32.573 --> 00:41:34.823
all of our team were, and we had an international team,

881
00:41:34.823 --> 00:41:36.999
people from Italy, people from Germany,

882
00:41:36.999 --> 00:41:39.452
local Eritreans who would put out their heart

883
00:41:39.452 --> 00:41:43.989
to get this going and who loved the results.

884
00:41:47.284 --> 00:41:49.797
I'm almost reluctant to say this on camera,

885
00:41:49.797 --> 00:41:53.658
but there was a result that was nearly unbelievable.

886
00:41:53.658 --> 00:41:56.731
Let's just say it's an unbelievable result

887
00:41:56.731 --> 00:41:57.766
<v Regina>Against all odds.</v>

888
00:41:57.766 --> 00:42:00.214
<v James>Against all odds.</v>

889
00:42:00.227 --> 00:42:04.189
In December of about 2000,

890
00:42:04.189 --> 00:42:08.876
comes a report from NOAA:

891
00:42:10.819 --> 00:42:14.552
Gigantic New Lakes Appearing in the Sahara Desert.

892
00:42:17.022 --> 00:42:20.592
Just South of the Aswan dam, or, excuse me,

893
00:42:20.592 --> 00:42:23.739
just North of the Aswan dam, but it's all based upon

894
00:42:23.739 --> 00:42:28.015
incredible increased flow down the Nile river,

895
00:42:28.015 --> 00:42:32.560
starting around 1995, which is around during our period.

896
00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.171
the period of our work,

897
00:42:34.171 --> 00:42:37.008
so I got out some maps, I traced the drainage basin

898
00:42:37.008 --> 00:42:38.416
of the Nile River,

899
00:42:38.416 --> 00:42:40.912
looked at the satellite pics from our work,

900
00:42:40.912 --> 00:42:43.225
and I was able to establish that

901
00:42:43.225 --> 00:42:46.010
the immense amount of rains

902
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:48.901
that were hitting in Eritrea were also hitting in Sudan,

903
00:42:48.901 --> 00:42:52.654
and other areas of the Nile River drainage basin.

904
00:42:52.654 --> 00:42:57.124
And all this amount of water was not only affecting

905
00:42:57.124 --> 00:42:59.576
the surface characteristics of that part of the world,

906
00:42:59.576 --> 00:43:03.841
but was draining into all the tributaries of the Nile River.

907
00:43:03.841 --> 00:43:07.534
And so the Nile River flows began going up dramatically,

908
00:43:07.534 --> 00:43:11.032
starting around 1995, '96, certainly in '98

909
00:43:11.032 --> 00:43:12.878
when we had our biggest result.

910
00:43:12.878 --> 00:43:15.704
We actually had three different stations in Eritrea,

911
00:43:15.704 --> 00:43:18.573
three different large devices working in coordination

912
00:43:18.573 --> 00:43:20.503
by radio telephone,

913
00:43:20.503 --> 00:43:24.385
and that's when we got the biggest result,

914
00:43:24.385 --> 00:43:28.514
and all of this water was coming into the Nile River

915
00:43:28.514 --> 00:43:32.764
so fast, it began filling the Aswan, filling Lake Nasser

916
00:43:32.764 --> 00:43:34.955
behind the Aswan high dam

917
00:43:34.955 --> 00:43:37.271
for the first time since it had been constructed

918
00:43:37.271 --> 00:43:39.724
in 1965 or '68.

919
00:43:39.724 --> 00:43:41.664
Okay, they had built that dam,

920
00:43:41.664 --> 00:43:43.093
they never got enough water

921
00:43:43.093 --> 00:43:45.568
because of the 30 years of drought I previously referenced,

922
00:43:45.568 --> 00:43:48.982
so they were squeaking by on irrigation

923
00:43:48.982 --> 00:43:52.555
in Egypt, which is way downstream on the Nile River.

924
00:43:52.555 --> 00:43:54.773
So after our work,

925
00:43:54.773 --> 00:43:57.012
all this immense water going into the Nile,

926
00:43:57.012 --> 00:44:01.440
the Nile River levels rising up, filling Lake Nasser,

927
00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:05.545
to the point where it's right up at the top,

928
00:44:05.545 --> 00:44:08.468
and so they open the overspill channel,

929
00:44:08.468 --> 00:44:11.390
which diverts water out into the open desert.

930
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:15.411
And all that overspill water creates three, four

931
00:44:15.411 --> 00:44:18.196
gigantic, huge, new lakes,

932
00:44:18.196 --> 00:44:19.827
which nobody has ever seen before,

933
00:44:19.827 --> 00:44:22.461
which are so big you cannot even see the other shore.

934
00:44:22.461 --> 00:44:25.171
You can go to Google Earth right now,

935
00:44:25.171 --> 00:44:27.422
go to Google Earth, look up Aswan High Dam,

936
00:44:27.422 --> 00:44:29.598
and then gyro over to the Northwest,

937
00:44:29.598 --> 00:44:32.317
and you'll see three of these four big lakes

938
00:44:32.317 --> 00:44:33.534
are still there,

939
00:44:33.534 --> 00:44:35.731
and in fact, the Egyptian government is bringing people

940
00:44:35.731 --> 00:44:38.899
there to do irrigation agriculture in those regions,

941
00:44:38.899 --> 00:44:41.159
trying to pull people out of the city.

942
00:44:41.159 --> 00:44:42.684
So they've got enough water there,

943
00:44:42.684 --> 00:44:44.445
they figure, for at least another decade

944
00:44:44.445 --> 00:44:46.663
of agricultural productivity,

945
00:44:46.663 --> 00:44:50.326
even if no more water is added to them.

946
00:44:50.706 --> 00:44:51.878
<v Regina>That brings us up to 2000,</v>

947
00:44:51.878 --> 00:44:54.908
how come you're not a household name?

948
00:44:54.908 --> 00:44:57.024
<v James>Well...</v>

949
00:45:00.827 --> 00:45:03.589
It's too much, it's too much.

950
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:07.238
We live in a world where people's perceptions

951
00:45:07.238 --> 00:45:09.841
are too narrow in this way.

952
00:45:09.841 --> 00:45:12.443
Think of poor Galileo, I mean,

953
00:45:12.443 --> 00:45:13.990
I'm not comparing myself to Galileo,

954
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:16.730
but I would describe Reich's discovery of the orgone energy

955
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:19.067
his invention of the cloud buster,

956
00:45:19.067 --> 00:45:21.786
which I just happened to be a lucky guy

957
00:45:21.786 --> 00:45:23.760
to learn about it and apply it.

958
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:28.004
But Reich's discovery changes so much.

959
00:45:28.004 --> 00:45:30.671
He talked about this himself, it is too much

960
00:45:30.671 --> 00:45:33.733
for the average scientist, for the average person.

961
00:45:33.733 --> 00:45:37.348
It's a breakthrough into the cosmic realm

962
00:45:37.348 --> 00:45:41.615
in ways that humanity is very poorly prepared for.

963
00:45:41.615 --> 00:45:44.196
And I think, we have the makings of,

964
00:45:44.196 --> 00:45:47.512
some people, we have a lot of brilliant people

965
00:45:47.512 --> 00:45:49.923
who can embrace these kind of ideas,

966
00:45:49.923 --> 00:45:52.706
wrap their mind around it, if you will.

967
00:45:52.706 --> 00:45:54.515
But for the most part, it's just too much.

968
00:45:54.515 --> 00:45:58.391
It's unbelievable, you talk about taking

969
00:45:58.391 --> 00:46:02.616
a small, little project that costs less than $50,000,

970
00:46:02.616 --> 00:46:05.826
probably for the whole three years, or four years

971
00:46:05.826 --> 00:46:10.232
of time, and greening up a chunk of the Sahara

972
00:46:10.232 --> 00:46:11.799
with new lakes.

973
00:46:11.799 --> 00:46:14.198
<v Regina>Without causing any depletion or damage</v>

974
00:46:14.198 --> 00:46:15.661
anywhere else.

975
00:46:15.661 --> 00:46:17.644
<v James>Well, there might have been some</v>

976
00:46:17.644 --> 00:46:20.311
somebody who got their garden flooded out,

977
00:46:20.311 --> 00:46:21.686
or something like this.

978
00:46:21.686 --> 00:46:23.191
<v Regina>But it's not as though it's destabilizing</v>

979
00:46:23.191 --> 00:46:25.291
anything and causing a drought elsewhere,

980
00:46:25.291 --> 00:46:26.284
that's not what's going on

981
00:46:26.284 --> 00:46:28.150
you're not robbing from Peter to pay Paul.

982
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:30.465
<v James>That's right, it creates a transformation</v>

983
00:46:30.465 --> 00:46:34.411
that literally, in terms of the physics of the atmosphere,

984
00:46:34.411 --> 00:46:38.070
it makes a change where moisture from the ocean regions

985
00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:41.355
intrudes into desert areas where it normally

986
00:46:41.355 --> 00:46:43.830
has been blocked.

987
00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:48.468
So it is a breakthrough, there is no question about it.

988
00:46:48.468 --> 00:46:51.337
It's as much of a breakthrough as the airplane,

989
00:46:51.337 --> 00:46:53.311
or the radio, even more so,

990
00:46:53.311 --> 00:46:57.578
but it's not known, partly because of academic blockade,

991
00:46:57.578 --> 00:47:02.122
partly because of malicious attacks by the skeptic groups,

992
00:47:02.122 --> 00:47:03.711
the organized skeptic groups,

993
00:47:03.711 --> 00:47:05.907
who are absolutely malicious characters,

994
00:47:05.907 --> 00:47:08.831
and of course, they were the ones who stood behind

995
00:47:08.831 --> 00:47:11.635
the attacks against Reich in the first place.

996
00:47:11.635 --> 00:47:13.726
<v Regina>So this all goes into a larger study</v>

997
00:47:13.726 --> 00:47:15.454
of what's called Orgonomy,

998
00:47:15.454 --> 00:47:18.290
and because we have so much more to talk about,

999
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:21.266
I would like to thank you for this part of our discussion,

1000
00:47:21.266 --> 00:47:23.966
and I would like to pick it up again in part two,

1001
00:47:23.966 --> 00:47:25.694
if you don't mind, would that be okay?

1002
00:47:25.694 --> 00:47:27.133
<v James>Don't mind at all, I'm delighted,</v>

1003
00:47:27.133 --> 00:47:30.146
thank you for your interest.

1004
00:47:31.336 --> 00:47:33.800
<v ->We had originally done a second interview with James,</v>

1005
00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:35.666
but the tape was mysteriously erased

1006
00:47:35.666 --> 00:47:37.511
when we were in the device known as

1007
00:47:37.511 --> 00:47:39.079
the orgone accumulator.

1008
00:47:39.079 --> 00:47:40.669
You can, however, find out more

1009
00:47:40.669 --> 00:47:42.694
about orgone energy and healing,

1010
00:47:42.694 --> 00:47:44.316
and Demeo and Reich's work

1011
00:47:44.316 --> 00:47:45.788
by purchasing one of his books

1012
00:47:45.788 --> 00:47:47.568
available at Amazon.com,

1013
00:47:47.568 --> 00:47:49.201
including Saharasia,

1014
00:47:49.201 --> 00:47:51.249
and we will try to catch up with James again

1015
00:47:51.249 --> 00:47:52.369
in the future.

1016
00:47:52.369 --> 00:47:54.705
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1017
00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:58.634
(ethereal music)
