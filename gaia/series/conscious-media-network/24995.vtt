00:00:00.888 --> 00:00:02.594
<v ->In my most recent conversation</v>

2
00:00:02.594 --> 00:00:04.290
with Her Holiness Sai Maa

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.925
we spoke of the future condition of mankind

4
00:00:06.925 --> 00:00:08.864
of what we're involving toward,

5
00:00:08.864 --> 00:00:10.164
and what will no longer serve us

6
00:00:10.164 --> 00:00:12.335
as members of the human race.

7
00:00:12.335 --> 00:00:13.566
Sai Maa shares that

8
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:14.924
while we may be growing

9
00:00:14.924 --> 00:00:17.374
in our divine capabilities and technology

10
00:00:17.374 --> 00:00:18.999
all of these gains are worth nothing

11
00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.612
if we do not operate from our hearts

12
00:00:21.612 --> 00:00:22.912
through a lens of love.

13
00:00:22.912 --> 00:00:24.085
In addition, she says

14
00:00:24.085 --> 00:00:25.478
that we're going to be letting go

15
00:00:25.478 --> 00:00:27.568
of our emotions as we know them.

16
00:00:27.568 --> 00:00:32.568 line:15% 
(soundscape music)

17
00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:37.297
Sai Maa welcome.

18
00:00:37.297 --> 00:00:40.931
It's good to see you again, yes.

19
00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:44.634
<v ->(Islamic greeting)</v>

20
00:00:44.634 --> 00:00:47.641
It's a great joy for me to be with you.

21
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:50.335
And for our next adventure.

22
00:00:50.335 --> 00:00:51.670
Blessings to all of you

23
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.244
with great love, thank you.

24
00:00:56.244 --> 00:00:58.148
<v Voiceover>We're going to go into an area</v>

25
00:00:58.148 --> 00:00:59.878
that is considered highly esoteric,

26
00:00:59.878 --> 00:01:01.654
but it's one that's very near and dear

27
00:01:01.654 --> 00:01:04.243
to my heart and to yours.

28
00:01:04.243 --> 00:01:08.853
And that is the continuance of knowledge.

29
00:01:08.853 --> 00:01:13.322
Knowledge has been gained and lost repeatedly

30
00:01:13.322 --> 00:01:16.329
in these earth permutations

31
00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.500
throughout history of the planet.

32
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.406
We're both aware

33
00:01:19.406 --> 00:01:21.589
of the Atlantean times and Atlantean knowledge

34
00:01:21.589 --> 00:01:23.690
and many Atlantean knowledgists

35
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.316
are trying to awaken again now.

36
00:01:27.316 --> 00:01:29.182
In the last couple of go rounds

37
00:01:29.182 --> 00:01:30.180
the knowledge was lost

38
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.282
and it's taken us a very long time

39
00:01:32.282 --> 00:01:33.686
except for a very few

40
00:01:33.686 --> 00:01:34.813
It's taken a very long time

41
00:01:34.813 --> 00:01:36.136
to even find our way back
<v Sai>to awaken</v>

42
00:01:36.136 --> 00:01:36.856
to this point
<v Sai>to the knowledge</v>

43
00:01:36.856 --> 00:01:38.760
to awaken, yes
<v Sai>the wisdom</v>

44
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.188
That's right, yes,
<v Sai>Knowledge</v>

45
00:01:40.188 --> 00:01:42.623
Yes, the wisdoms
<v Sai>is not enough</v>

46
00:01:42.623 --> 00:01:44.662
<v Voiceover>Off camera</v>

47
00:01:44.662 --> 00:01:45.472
you were saying,

48
00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:47.080
Ah, that there is a way,

49
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.470
no matter what happens

50
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.531
in our futures, to maintain the knowledge

51
00:01:51.531 --> 00:01:53.365
that we have awakened to.

52
00:01:53.365 --> 00:01:54.666
Let's just launch in

53
00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:58.636
and you can go anywhere you like with this.

54
00:01:58.636 --> 00:02:03.636
<v ->Yes, we speak of the Altlantean Civilization era.</v>

55
00:02:05.045 --> 00:02:07.518
If we do not pay attention

56
00:02:07.518 --> 00:02:10.838
the same thing will happen to this one.

57
00:02:10.838 --> 00:02:13.752
We cannot be proud that we were Atlantean

58
00:02:13.752 --> 00:02:18.752
simply because we did not love.

59
00:02:19.197 --> 00:02:22.901
We started with love and moving technology.

60
00:02:22.901 --> 00:02:27.475
Great intellect, great intelligence.

61
00:02:27.475 --> 00:02:29.542
We forgot the heart.

62
00:02:29.542 --> 00:02:30.877
And while forgetting the heart

63
00:02:30.877 --> 00:02:35.208
what happens is the ego start to grow.

64
00:02:35.208 --> 00:02:37.878
The ego start to grow and grow and grow.

65
00:02:37.878 --> 00:02:42.878
And we then by that we could not forgive.

66
00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:45.552
We could not love.

67
00:02:45.552 --> 00:02:50.196
With our technology, we sank.

68
00:02:50.196 --> 00:02:54.759
If there's no love on this plane right now,

69
00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:56.071
the same thing will happen.

70
00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:59.124
We will not be able to make of this planet a Venus.

71
00:02:59.124 --> 00:03:02.073
Because there'll be nothing of love.

72
00:03:02.073 --> 00:03:05.870
So I'm very concerned.

73
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.449
You see when we were Atlantean,

74
00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:09.306
when we were Egyptian,

75
00:03:09.306 --> 00:03:10.746
we could use black magic,

76
00:03:10.746 --> 00:03:13.579
we could use white magic.

77
00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.552
Without love,

78
00:03:15.552 --> 00:03:18.350
it will be only curse and black magic.

79
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.918
Because of the power

80
00:03:19.918 --> 00:03:24.918
that we will be creating from within.

81
00:03:25.258 --> 00:03:29.902
We'll be able to curse anybody at any moment.

82
00:03:29.902 --> 00:03:31.667
And that create evil.

83
00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:34.895
That create entities of darkness.

84
00:03:34.895 --> 00:03:36.334
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

85
00:03:36.334 --> 00:03:38.610
<v ->So it's fantastic to move to the place.</v>

86
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.908
It's a golden opportunity right now

87
00:03:40.908 --> 00:03:43.329
in our hand for what's coming.

88
00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.378
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about</v>

89
00:03:45.378 --> 00:03:47.515
your understanding of what's coming

90
00:03:47.515 --> 00:03:49.186
and how we prepare ourselves

91
00:03:49.186 --> 00:03:50.916
and how we maintain

92
00:03:50.916 --> 00:03:55.154
what we have remembered.

93
00:03:55.154 --> 00:03:57.255
<v ->What's coming is big.</v>

94
00:03:57.255 --> 00:03:59.868
It's really big.

95
00:03:59.868 --> 00:04:01.203
It's a place where

96
00:04:01.203 --> 00:04:02.399
I go further to the work

97
00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:07.399
of (study references) all ascended masters.

98
00:04:09.306 --> 00:04:11.745
I had an experience once.

99
00:04:11.745 --> 00:04:12.940
I needed something

100
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.543
and my arms become very long

101
00:04:14.543 --> 00:04:16.412
and grabbed this something.

102
00:04:16.412 --> 00:04:18.978
That can be very scary.

103
00:04:18.978 --> 00:04:20.812
We are moving into a time

104
00:04:20.812 --> 00:04:23.111
where we will not need transportation.

105
00:04:23.111 --> 00:04:24.608
It's not a coincidence

106
00:04:24.608 --> 00:04:25.560
that we are going through

107
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.987
all this crisis.

108
00:04:27.987 --> 00:04:29.322
Simply because we'll be able

109
00:04:29.322 --> 00:04:30.994
to teleport ourselves,

110
00:04:30.994 --> 00:04:34.001
bio-locate and manifest

111
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:36.067
whatever we need or wish

112
00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:38.633
from the unmanifest.

113
00:04:38.633 --> 00:04:40.433
Meaning the consciousness of human

114
00:04:40.433 --> 00:04:44.938
will become that Godly species.

115
00:04:44.938 --> 00:04:47.944
That evolution, that divine human.

116
00:04:47.944 --> 00:04:52.101
That alchemy from spirit to humanness

117
00:04:52.101 --> 00:04:55.781
into one, alchemy.

118
00:04:55.781 --> 00:04:58.591
It is possible to get there even without love.

119
00:04:58.591 --> 00:05:01.319
The only thing is when we get to that place.

120
00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:05.023
When there's no love, it's a disaster.

121
00:05:05.023 --> 00:05:08.703
It's all about ego base, intellect base.

122
00:05:08.703 --> 00:05:10.805
One side of the brain is developed.

123
00:05:10.805 --> 00:05:12.302
So I am insisting

124
00:05:12.302 --> 00:05:16.702
that we move into that love place.

125
00:05:16.702 --> 00:05:19.640
Love create compassion.

126
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.007
Love create forgiveness.

127
00:05:23.007 --> 00:05:24.551
Love create healing.

128
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:27.012
Love create transformation.

129
00:05:27.012 --> 00:05:28.556
Love create acceptance.

130
00:05:28.556 --> 00:05:29.891
Love create harmony.

131
00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:31.981
Love create peace.

132
00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:35.580
And there'll be no competition in that place.

133
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.426
So where we are going

134
00:05:37.426 --> 00:05:39.795
it's extremely important

135
00:05:39.795 --> 00:05:42.360
that we create healthy relationship,

136
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.835
loving relationship,

137
00:05:43.835 --> 00:05:45.762
acceptance relationship.

138
00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.771
And all kind of chaos is happening

139
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:51.602
on the planet and its going to be worse.

140
00:05:51.602 --> 00:05:52.867
<v Voiceover>Yes, it is going to be worse,</v>

141
00:05:52.867 --> 00:05:54.876
and people start fearing

142
00:05:54.876 --> 00:05:57.442
for the lose of the physical life.

143
00:05:57.442 --> 00:05:58.916
But in reality,

144
00:05:58.916 --> 00:06:02.922
we inherit what's on the other side, anyway.

145
00:06:02.922 --> 00:06:04.330
<v ->What we inherit, we are.</v>

146
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.009
<v Voiceover>We are, yes, yes.</v>

147
00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:07.659
<v ->I would not say what's on the other side.</v>

148
00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:10.991
We are here in a physical body,

149
00:06:10.991 --> 00:06:12.721
the divine essence,

150
00:06:12.721 --> 00:06:14.694
the essence of life,

151
00:06:14.694 --> 00:06:16.494
the greatness of life.

152
00:06:16.494 --> 00:06:19.327
We cannot be killed.

153
00:06:19.327 --> 00:06:22.101
We cannot die.

154
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:23.611
<v Voiceover>There's a famous saying,</v>

155
00:06:23.611 --> 00:06:25.608
I think it was Tong and Chiu,

156
00:06:25.608 --> 00:06:28.081
What's the problem with death?

157
00:06:28.081 --> 00:06:30.646
You live through it anyway.
<v Sai>Every moment</v>

158
00:06:30.646 --> 00:06:31.552
Which is true.

159
00:06:31.552 --> 00:06:32.318
Every moment,

160
00:06:32.318 --> 00:06:33.549
but when I say inherit,

161
00:06:33.549 --> 00:06:35.012
I mean as in inheriting the earth

162
00:06:35.012 --> 00:06:37.415
as in inheriting the future condition

163
00:06:37.415 --> 00:06:39.191
and future incarnations.

164
00:06:39.191 --> 00:06:42.059
What we sow the seeds for now.

165
00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:45.797
<v ->Wherever and whatever we create now</v>

166
00:06:45.797 --> 00:06:48.665
is entering our DNA.

167
00:06:48.665 --> 00:06:49.861
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about the DNA.</v>

168
00:06:49.861 --> 00:06:53.170
<v ->The DNA is a storeroom</v>

169
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.037
of everything we create.

170
00:06:56.037 --> 00:06:58.835
My philosophy, we've created it,

171
00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.448
we can de-create it.

172
00:07:01.448 --> 00:07:03.073
No big deal.

173
00:07:03.073 --> 00:07:05.209
It's a matter of what's within us.

174
00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:06.974
The DNA itself

175
00:07:06.974 --> 00:07:11.281
has its original template in it.

176
00:07:11.281 --> 00:07:14.590
Are we ready to uncover that?

177
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.622
Are we ready to look within?

178
00:07:16.622 --> 00:07:18.863
Are we ready to really see

179
00:07:18.863 --> 00:07:21.417
what are we about?

180
00:07:21.417 --> 00:07:23.402
<v Voiceover>Because we've been working off of</v>

181
00:07:23.402 --> 00:07:25.503
and developing ourselves off of

182
00:07:25.503 --> 00:07:28.476
very limited DNA for a good while now, too.

183
00:07:28.476 --> 00:07:31.239
<v ->That was for purpose of forgetfulness</v>

184
00:07:31.239 --> 00:07:32.365
<v Voiceover>That's right.</v>

185
00:07:32.365 --> 00:07:33.909
<v ->The planet herself</v>

186
00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:36.707
when she was created

187
00:07:36.707 --> 00:07:39.145
with all the elohims

188
00:07:39.145 --> 00:07:41.212
and cosmic beings, she did say

189
00:07:41.212 --> 00:07:45.090
Okay I'll go to bed, I'll sleep.

190
00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.053
I'll tell you one thing,

191
00:07:46.053 --> 00:07:48.120
I'll be awakened at a certain time,

192
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.558
and this is the time.

193
00:07:50.558 --> 00:07:53.925
With that the sacred feminine comes up.

194
00:07:53.925 --> 00:07:55.364
Why the sacred feminine?

195
00:07:55.364 --> 00:07:56.734
Why the feminine?

196
00:07:56.734 --> 00:07:59.463
Even the male today are to be,

197
00:07:59.463 --> 00:08:01.436
the male physical human

198
00:08:01.436 --> 00:08:05.976
are to be more, more feminine in a way

199
00:08:05.976 --> 00:08:08.468
more sacred to allow the love

200
00:08:08.468 --> 00:08:11.351
the tenderness, the sweetness to life

201
00:08:11.351 --> 00:08:14.149
to be awakened from them.

202
00:08:14.149 --> 00:08:15.415
And that energy

203
00:08:15.415 --> 00:08:17.354
because it will be new,

204
00:08:17.354 --> 00:08:19.281
all kind of challenges

205
00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:21.522
will happen in relationships.

206
00:08:21.522 --> 00:08:23.460
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about that.</v>

207
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.796
<v ->It's not very important.</v>

208
00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:26.398
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about the new energy,</v>

209
00:08:26.398 --> 00:08:27.524
the new energy coming in,

210
00:08:27.524 --> 00:08:28.534
and what it's doing,

211
00:08:28.534 --> 00:08:30.961
the kind of things we're hearing

212
00:08:30.961 --> 00:08:31.762
whispered in our ear

213
00:08:31.762 --> 00:08:33.236
that we don't know how to respond to.

214
00:08:33.236 --> 00:08:35.036
<v ->The point for the planet</v>

215
00:08:35.036 --> 00:08:36.344
and the human race now

216
00:08:36.344 --> 00:08:38.136
it's an evolution that takes one

217
00:08:38.136 --> 00:08:40.841
to the superconscious.

218
00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:43.383
For that each and everyone

219
00:08:43.383 --> 00:08:46.077
is to experience their enlightenment,

220
00:08:46.077 --> 00:08:50.256
their mastery.

221
00:08:50.256 --> 00:08:53.554
For one to move into the place of enlightenment,

222
00:08:53.554 --> 00:08:57.989
one cannot depend on any other human being.

223
00:08:57.989 --> 00:08:59.927
If I depend on you to be happy,

224
00:08:59.927 --> 00:09:02.865
how can I be enlightened?

225
00:09:02.865 --> 00:09:07.865
So there is a sort of (mumble)

226
00:09:09.808 --> 00:09:13.511
as if all relationship are going

227
00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:18.511
through a cutting process of umbilical cord

228
00:09:19.316 --> 00:09:21.487
between them so that they can

229
00:09:21.487 --> 00:09:24.157
stand on their own identity

230
00:09:24.157 --> 00:09:26.085
to know who they are.

231
00:09:26.085 --> 00:09:27.780
This is now the time of,

232
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.031
"Who am I?"

233
00:09:31.031 --> 00:09:32.389
I've done therapy.

234
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:34.456
I've meditate,

235
00:09:34.456 --> 00:09:37.068
and I'm still not well.

236
00:09:37.068 --> 00:09:38.101
So how can they be

237
00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:40.690
in a healthy relationship

238
00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.165
when they're not well?

239
00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:43.836
Because they will attract this mirror

240
00:09:43.836 --> 00:09:47.308
as consciousness.

241
00:09:47.308 --> 00:09:48.504
Am I being clear?

242
00:09:48.504 --> 00:09:49.177
<v Voiceover>Yes, very clear.</v>

243
00:09:49.177 --> 00:09:51.116
<v ->So, most people, I say,</v>

244
00:09:51.116 --> 00:09:53.113
the challenge will be for relationship.

245
00:09:53.113 --> 00:09:54.355
They will not understand

246
00:09:54.355 --> 00:09:56.085
why they can't get along

247
00:09:56.085 --> 00:09:58.024
with their partners anymore.

248
00:09:58.024 --> 00:09:58.720
<v Voiceover>In other words,</v>

249
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.415
you don't take the list out.

250
00:10:00.415 --> 00:10:02.923
Has to be tall, handsome,

251
00:10:02.923 --> 00:10:04.932
has to have money.
<v Sai>That is over.</v>

252
00:10:04.932 --> 00:10:09.520
All of those old (incoherent)
<v Sai>over, over.</v>

253
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.001
<v ->Go inside, find out what's not working</v>

254
00:10:13.001 --> 00:10:16.077
with yourself, and then the more you evolve,

255
00:10:16.077 --> 00:10:21.077
you can say, "I call forth the soul that fits with me."

256
00:10:21.476 --> 00:10:23.183
And your soul may not be ready

257
00:10:23.183 --> 00:10:26.015
for you to be in a relationship, to share.

258
00:10:26.015 --> 00:10:27.583
You see, most relationship

259
00:10:27.583 --> 00:10:29.754
is needy relationship.

260
00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:32.053
I'm with you so I don't feel depressed,

261
00:10:32.053 --> 00:10:32.854
I don't feel lonely,

262
00:10:32.854 --> 00:10:34.920
I can pay my loan, dah, dah, dah.

263
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.625
It's a relationship of sharing.

264
00:10:37.625 --> 00:10:40.365
Meaning that if you go to the movie,

265
00:10:40.365 --> 00:10:44.835
I don't pout when you come back.

266
00:10:44.835 --> 00:10:46.670
If I wish to go to a concert

267
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:47.993
and you don't like this music,

268
00:10:47.993 --> 00:10:51.499
you are happy when I come back,

269
00:10:51.499 --> 00:10:52.811
which is not the case up to now.

270
00:10:52.811 --> 00:10:54.297
We depend on somebody else,

271
00:10:54.297 --> 00:10:55.911
and we wish to be invited

272
00:10:55.911 --> 00:10:57.211
at the same place together.

273
00:10:57.211 --> 00:10:58.280
We wish to do everything...,

274
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.449
and we are so emersed in the other

275
00:11:01.449 --> 00:11:04.050
that we do not know our self anymore.

276
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:07.347
So this time, preparing the golden age

277
00:11:07.347 --> 00:11:10.424
is not about us as a couple.

278
00:11:10.424 --> 00:11:11.956
It's about, Who am I?

279
00:11:11.956 --> 00:11:12.931
What's my role?

280
00:11:12.931 --> 00:11:14.731
What responsibility do I take?

281
00:11:14.731 --> 00:11:18.133
What is my own real identity?

282
00:11:18.133 --> 00:11:19.770
That is scary for many.

283
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.301
<v Voiceover>It is scary, it is scary for many.</v>

284
00:11:22.301 --> 00:11:23.044
Let's talk about

285
00:11:23.044 --> 00:11:25.664
how the energies and events

286
00:11:25.664 --> 00:11:27.978
from your perspective and knowledge

287
00:11:27.978 --> 00:11:29.267
will be unfolding

288
00:11:29.267 --> 00:11:31.542
over the course of the next decade or so,

289
00:11:31.542 --> 00:11:34.154
what people should be ready for.

290
00:11:34.154 --> 00:11:37.185
<v ->Ready to die.</v>

291
00:11:37.185 --> 00:11:41.991
And when you realize that death is at every moment.

292
00:11:41.991 --> 00:11:44.325
The one minute that just passed is death.

293
00:11:44.325 --> 00:11:48.783
It's over, and ready for the inner energy

294
00:11:48.783 --> 00:11:53.125
the highest self takes over.

295
00:11:53.125 --> 00:11:57.200
We surrender to the highest within us,

296
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.580
to the light within us,

297
00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.111
not to the ego,

298
00:12:02.111 --> 00:12:04.085
not to allow the ego to manipulate us

299
00:12:04.085 --> 00:12:06.581
and do whatever the ego wish.

300
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:09.321
But allow the, the light inside

301
00:12:09.321 --> 00:12:11.353
the higher self, the great self

302
00:12:11.353 --> 00:12:14.627
to embody the humanness

303
00:12:14.627 --> 00:12:17.355
takes over and guide the path

304
00:12:17.355 --> 00:12:19.828
and guide humanity at the same time.

305
00:12:19.828 --> 00:12:22.231
That's why I insist on mastering.

306
00:12:22.231 --> 00:12:25.169
<v Voiceover>This seems to be the most important part.</v>

307
00:12:25.169 --> 00:12:28.675
Because again, if we are going to be

308
00:12:28.675 --> 00:12:30.858
ultimately coming back here

309
00:12:30.858 --> 00:12:33.168
if we choose to do these incarnations,

310
00:12:33.168 --> 00:12:35.606
we're entering a very different world

311
00:12:35.606 --> 00:12:37.707
after these changes take place.

312
00:12:37.707 --> 00:12:39.077
Very different directive,

313
00:12:39.077 --> 00:12:41.144
a different civilization

314
00:12:41.144 --> 00:12:43.954
and less human
<v Sai>and less human.</v>

315
00:12:43.954 --> 00:12:46.786
and we can really prepare ourselves

316
00:12:46.786 --> 00:12:50.345
for our continuance on a higher level now.

317
00:12:50.345 --> 00:12:51.964
<v ->I'll give you an example,</v>

318
00:12:51.964 --> 00:12:55.297
what's going to happen.

319
00:12:55.297 --> 00:12:57.293
You may be aware how human

320
00:12:57.293 --> 00:13:00.300
are constantly the emotional energies

321
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.276
and most of the time

322
00:13:01.276 --> 00:13:03.969
low-frequency emotion.
<v Voiceover>That's very true</v>

323
00:13:03.969 --> 00:13:05.943
This is brainwashed.

324
00:13:05.943 --> 00:13:08.311
Now if people are not strong

325
00:13:08.311 --> 00:13:09.774
in their emotional body.

326
00:13:09.774 --> 00:13:10.645
they are shaken.

327
00:13:10.645 --> 00:13:12.711
They are into a chaotic situation.

328
00:13:12.711 --> 00:13:14.348
What do they do when they are not well

329
00:13:14.348 --> 00:13:16.055
emotionally or mentally?

330
00:13:16.055 --> 00:13:19.225
They eat, or drink.
<v Voiceover>or drink.</v>

331
00:13:19.225 --> 00:13:21.684
or all kind of addictions.

332
00:13:21.684 --> 00:13:23.892
Let's talk only of the eating part.

333
00:13:23.892 --> 00:13:28.606
They need to eat to calm themselves down.

334
00:13:28.606 --> 00:13:31.137
This is coming to an end.

335
00:13:31.137 --> 00:13:33.308
It's coming to that place

336
00:13:33.308 --> 00:13:37.174
we will not be eating the way we eat anymore.

337
00:13:37.174 --> 00:13:41.377
The more we enhance our energies,

338
00:13:41.377 --> 00:13:44.151
the more we grow in or higher frequency

339
00:13:44.151 --> 00:13:47.646
we will be eating through prana.

340
00:13:47.646 --> 00:13:52.467
So for that somebody has to be emotionally strong.

341
00:13:52.467 --> 00:13:53.788
<v Voiceover>Very good point.</v>

342
00:13:53.788 --> 00:13:57.387
<v ->Mentally clear, a clear intellect</v>

343
00:13:57.387 --> 00:13:59.732
a clarity, with the purity

344
00:13:59.732 --> 00:14:02.936
because the more your energy will be

345
00:14:02.936 --> 00:14:04.434
the higher frequency.

346
00:14:04.434 --> 00:14:07.429
Let's talk of the Atlantean time.

347
00:14:07.429 --> 00:14:09.008
If there is no purity,

348
00:14:09.008 --> 00:14:11.458
you will destroy others and yourself,

349
00:14:11.458 --> 00:14:12.909
and the planet with it.

350
00:14:12.909 --> 00:14:15.011
<v Voiceover>Because of the intensity</v>

351
00:14:15.011 --> 00:14:17.983
of the power of one's thought and intention

352
00:14:17.983 --> 00:14:20.177
we can't do it as irresponsibly

353
00:14:20.177 --> 00:14:22.604
because we won't be a dense (laughs),

354
00:14:22.604 --> 00:14:25.058
on every level.
<v Sai>Dense is the word.</v>

355
00:14:25.058 --> 00:14:27.375
<v ->We are to be more refined.</v>

356
00:14:27.375 --> 00:14:29.662
We are to be more sound.

357
00:14:29.662 --> 00:14:31.926
We are to be more vibration.

358
00:14:31.926 --> 00:14:35.293
We are to be more light.

359
00:14:35.293 --> 00:14:37.418
That's where we are to be.

360
00:14:37.418 --> 00:14:39.403
<v Voiceover>How do you see this transition taking place</v>

361
00:14:39.403 --> 00:14:41.400
with the souls that exist today

362
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:46.369
and the vast disconnect

363
00:14:46.369 --> 00:14:47.681
between those who

364
00:14:47.681 --> 00:14:49.481
have really worked on mastery

365
00:14:49.481 --> 00:14:53.486
and those who have worked on barely survival?

366
00:14:53.486 --> 00:14:57.016
<v ->Well, one thing I found out.</v>

367
00:14:57.016 --> 00:14:59.256
I will take this country.

368
00:14:59.256 --> 00:15:02.159
Many who are teachers,

369
00:15:02.159 --> 00:15:03.262
There's a big difference

370
00:15:03.262 --> 00:15:05.619
between masters and teachers.

371
00:15:05.619 --> 00:15:10.123
Many who are teachers think they are there.

372
00:15:10.123 --> 00:15:12.468
What is your point of view on that?

373
00:15:12.468 --> 00:15:15.232
<v Voiceover>No, that is not correct.</v>

374
00:15:15.232 --> 00:15:17.972
Mastery is different.
<v Sai>Thank you.</v>

375
00:15:17.972 --> 00:15:19.841
Teaching's a mental construct.

376
00:15:19.841 --> 00:15:20.642
<v ->Thank you.</v>

377
00:15:20.642 --> 00:15:24.685
Now these teachers thinking they are masters

378
00:15:24.685 --> 00:15:29.314
They create this ego on a pedestal

379
00:15:29.314 --> 00:15:34.191
of themself and they do wrong to the planet.

380
00:15:34.191 --> 00:15:35.665
But they're unaware.

381
00:15:35.665 --> 00:15:37.267
How do we deal with this?

382
00:15:37.267 --> 00:15:39.729
This is your country, tell me.

383
00:15:39.729 --> 00:15:41.900
<v Voiceover>Well, again, there's only one way.</v>

384
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.467
And that is education,

385
00:15:43.467 --> 00:15:45.197
and education is the understanding

386
00:15:45.197 --> 00:15:47.635
that we have to go inside
<v Sai>with humility.</v>

387
00:15:47.635 --> 00:15:48.738
and compassion

388
00:15:48.738 --> 00:15:50.538
the love for oneself even.
<v Sai>Alright.</v>

389
00:15:50.538 --> 00:15:51.606
Genuine compassion

390
00:15:51.606 --> 00:15:53.428
and love for oneself, not ego.

391
00:15:53.428 --> 00:15:54.543
<v ->Meaning humility.</v>

392
00:15:54.543 --> 00:15:56.610
Now when you ask me the question

393
00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:58.247
about those who have done the work

394
00:15:58.247 --> 00:16:01.079
let's say 50 years, 40 years, 35 years,

395
00:16:01.079 --> 00:16:03.146
and those who are living on survival.

396
00:16:03.146 --> 00:16:05.120
These who are on survival mode

397
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.256
can turn it like this (snaps fingers)

398
00:16:07.256 --> 00:16:08.823
and have a big shift of consciousness

399
00:16:08.823 --> 00:16:10.425
and work differently
<v Voiceover>Makes sense.</v>

400
00:16:10.425 --> 00:16:11.958
<v Voiceover>Because there isn't the impediment</v>

401
00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.827
of the mental construct
<v Sai>Thank you.</v>

402
00:16:13.827 --> 00:16:15.662
or the ego belief systems
<v Sai>Thank you.</v>

403
00:16:15.662 --> 00:16:17.403
<v ->And the other one was working,</v>

404
00:16:17.403 --> 00:16:20.932
I am this, I am that, I can do better.

405
00:16:20.932 --> 00:16:22.941
Because they are like this

406
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:27.237
I am not sure they will survive the next step.

407
00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:29.106
Lack of humility.

408
00:16:29.106 --> 00:16:30.383
<v Voiceover>Makes sense.</v>

409
00:16:30.383 --> 00:16:34.088
<v ->And there's no love in that place</v>

410
00:16:34.088 --> 00:16:37.866
Where is the grace of life?

411
00:16:37.866 --> 00:16:40.159
<v Voiceover>Very true.</v>

412
00:16:40.159 --> 00:16:41.389
So we need to begin checking

413
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:43.328
in with ourselves and seeing
<v Sai>Thank you.</v>

414
00:16:43.328 --> 00:16:46.627
what is real and genuine.
<v Sai>Thank you.</v>

415
00:16:46.627 --> 00:16:48.902
<v ->And what is to be healed in me.</v>

416
00:16:48.902 --> 00:16:50.468
What are the wounds that I carry

417
00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:51.594
that separate me

418
00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:55.887
and I wish always to control and manipulate others.

419
00:16:55.887 --> 00:16:58.537
I'm talkin', you speak of those who are in survival mode

420
00:16:58.537 --> 00:17:00.813
and those who have done some work.

421
00:17:00.813 --> 00:17:05.813
I'm speaking for those who have done some work.

422
00:17:06.177 --> 00:17:11.177
That that humility, that purity, that greatness

423
00:17:14.582 --> 00:17:15.691
Where is this?

424
00:17:15.691 --> 00:17:18.622
<v Voiceover>Yes, Yes.</v>

425
00:17:18.622 --> 00:17:20.724
So this is the beginning point.

426
00:17:20.724 --> 00:17:23.162
Because a lot of people will be watching this

427
00:17:23.162 --> 00:17:25.496
are people who have been looking and seeking

428
00:17:25.496 --> 00:17:27.736
and gaining knowledge for themselves

429
00:17:27.736 --> 00:17:30.302
and some of it is just mental constructs.

430
00:17:30.302 --> 00:17:31.869
<v ->You're right.</v>

431
00:17:31.869 --> 00:17:33.649
I've watched.

432
00:17:33.649 --> 00:17:35.812
You are right.

433
00:17:35.812 --> 00:17:37.082
<v Voiceover>There is an addiction</v>

434
00:17:37.082 --> 00:17:39.149
to learning more.

435
00:17:39.149 --> 00:17:42.017
I'm in that position because I have to be.

436
00:17:42.017 --> 00:17:43.514
Because I need to have knowledge

437
00:17:43.514 --> 00:17:45.511
in order to be able to do what I do here

438
00:17:45.511 --> 00:17:46.858
to bring forth many positions,

439
00:17:46.858 --> 00:17:49.610
but I also understand

440
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:51.955
there is only a certain range of information

441
00:17:51.955 --> 00:17:56.633
that one actually is to utilize for your own self.

442
00:17:56.633 --> 00:17:59.501
<v ->Again come back to love and humility,</v>

443
00:17:59.501 --> 00:18:02.891
purity, clarity.

444
00:18:02.891 --> 00:18:06.270
Look with the eyes of love.

445
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.174
Look for the sake of looking

446
00:18:08.174 --> 00:18:11.076
without the judgement on it.

447
00:18:11.076 --> 00:18:13.410
<v Voiceover>Choosing peace within</v>

448
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.082
<v ->And be that</v>

449
00:18:15.082 --> 00:18:17.520
and marinate in that peace.

450
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.852
Again we come back to love.

451
00:18:20.852 --> 00:18:23.557
It's so extremely important.

452
00:18:23.557 --> 00:18:26.692
Without love, there's nothing possible.

453
00:18:26.692 --> 00:18:29.165
Without love, we create another Atlantis

454
00:18:29.165 --> 00:18:32.102
instead of another Venus.

455
00:18:32.102 --> 00:18:34.064
The love is the ingredient.

456
00:18:34.064 --> 00:18:37.234
It is the remedy for everything.

457
00:18:37.234 --> 00:18:38.604
Forgiveness.

458
00:18:38.604 --> 00:18:39.869
<v Voiceover>And yet we're being led down</v>

459
00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:41.878
the further path of technology

460
00:18:41.878 --> 00:18:43.515
on every level, every day.
<v Sai>I am very pleased</v>

461
00:18:43.515 --> 00:18:47.044
separating us from
<v Sai>technology is coming</v>

462
00:18:47.044 --> 00:18:48.646
this aspect often.

463
00:18:48.646 --> 00:18:50.515
Because people don't necessarily integrate them.

464
00:18:50.515 --> 00:18:53.685
You go down this path.

465
00:18:53.685 --> 00:18:55.426
<v ->I would not say integration.</v>

466
00:18:55.426 --> 00:18:57.563
I would say, Have the highest technology.

467
00:18:57.563 --> 00:18:58.399
Whatever technology

468
00:18:58.399 --> 00:19:00.724
you see here nowadays, nothing

469
00:19:00.724 --> 00:19:02.349
comparing to what we've known.

470
00:19:02.349 --> 00:19:03.495
<v Voiceover>Yes, that's true.</v>

471
00:19:03.495 --> 00:19:06.013
<v ->Nothing! It's a dust.</v>

472
00:19:06.013 --> 00:19:08.406
Make the technology big

473
00:19:08.406 --> 00:19:10.299
so we can just (snaps fingers)

474
00:19:10.299 --> 00:19:13.480
instantly manifest nearly anything.

475
00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.081
Love with that.

476
00:19:16.081 --> 00:19:18.751
Love, see someone with love.

477
00:19:18.751 --> 00:19:20.376
Do things with love.

478
00:19:20.376 --> 00:19:22.687
Create love within us.

479
00:19:22.687 --> 00:19:24.475
<v Voiceover>Text message with love.</v>

480
00:19:24.475 --> 00:19:27.249
<v ->I'm good at that (laughs)
<v Voiceover>(laughs)</v>

481
00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:27.958
<v Voiceover>There you go</v>

482
00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:30.512
as long as you throw out the love (laughs).

483
00:19:30.512 --> 00:19:31.988
<v ->One thing is very important</v>

484
00:19:31.988 --> 00:19:32.996
as we just talk of

485
00:19:32.996 --> 00:19:34.414
those who are teachers

486
00:19:34.414 --> 00:19:35.527
and those who are masters.

487
00:19:35.527 --> 00:19:37.965
Whenever this happen into our world,

488
00:19:37.965 --> 00:19:42.203
we observe, we see, blessings.

489
00:19:42.203 --> 00:19:43.910
Pour blessings on these beings.

490
00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:48.205
Live blessings in this situation.

491
00:19:48.205 --> 00:19:49.947
You know, right now,

492
00:19:49.947 --> 00:19:51.816
from the sun itself

493
00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:56.816
drops of very unqualified energies is coming out.

494
00:19:59.351 --> 00:20:01.685
These energies has no discernment.

495
00:20:01.685 --> 00:20:02.753
They penetrate everything.

496
00:20:02.753 --> 00:20:04.459
They penetrate flowers, animals,

497
00:20:04.459 --> 00:20:07.629
and human beings.

498
00:20:07.629 --> 00:20:10.369
When we resist,

499
00:20:10.369 --> 00:20:12.296
when energy has to come in,

500
00:20:12.296 --> 00:20:14.038
it breaks us to enter.

501
00:20:14.038 --> 00:20:15.640
Because this energy will enter

502
00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.567
no matter what.

503
00:20:17.567 --> 00:20:21.445
It's so important for us right now

504
00:20:21.445 --> 00:20:26.445
to know that we are to surrender, surrender.

505
00:20:29.688 --> 00:20:34.688
Surrender mean instead of this, this.

506
00:20:34.869 --> 00:20:36.921
Give ourself to the light.

507
00:20:36.921 --> 00:20:41.693
Give the personality that we are to the light.

508
00:20:41.693 --> 00:20:45.001
Give the emotional body that we are to the light.

509
00:20:45.001 --> 00:20:48.066
Give the mental body that we carry to the light.

510
00:20:48.066 --> 00:20:51.062
Give everything, surrender.

511
00:20:51.062 --> 00:20:56.062
And I tell you, magic is happening, magic.

512
00:20:56.936 --> 00:20:59.746
So many gateways are open right now for us.

513
00:20:59.746 --> 00:21:03.844
So many, so many other energy from the cosmos

514
00:21:03.844 --> 00:21:07.223
from the universe are coming right here to serve.

515
00:21:07.223 --> 00:21:09.824
And some are coming for curiousity.

516
00:21:09.824 --> 00:21:12.424
Because it's all about energy.

517
00:21:12.424 --> 00:21:13.492
You will hear people,

518
00:21:13.492 --> 00:21:16.151
We're moving to spaceship, come back.

519
00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:17.602
Some people we will ascend,

520
00:21:17.602 --> 00:21:18.484
some will come back.

521
00:21:18.484 --> 00:21:19.832
Some will not come back.

522
00:21:19.832 --> 00:21:21.739
It's all about ascending

523
00:21:21.739 --> 00:21:24.638
in the greatness of who we are.

524
00:21:24.638 --> 00:21:27.517
Move back into the great central sun.

525
00:21:27.517 --> 00:21:30.242
Move back consciously

526
00:21:30.242 --> 00:21:32.846
in the place where we are from.

527
00:21:32.846 --> 00:21:35.656
It's not that we are disconnected.

528
00:21:35.656 --> 00:21:37.038
We're simply not aware anymore.

529
00:21:37.038 --> 00:21:40.309
<v Voiceover>We've forgotten.</v>

530
00:21:40.309 --> 00:21:43.864
<v ->I wish to cancel the word forget from now on</v>

531
00:21:43.864 --> 00:21:46.023
and put awareness.

532
00:21:46.023 --> 00:21:48.462
'Cause if we empower too much the word forget

533
00:21:48.462 --> 00:21:50.656
<v Voiceover>It creates more forgetfulness.</v>

534
00:21:50.656 --> 00:21:51.573
Yes, of course.

535
00:21:51.573 --> 00:21:56.089
<v ->So I would appreciate if we start thinking awareness.</v>

536
00:21:56.089 --> 00:21:58.574
I am aware, or I'm not aware.

537
00:21:58.574 --> 00:22:02.510
I can be aware a minute after.

538
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.216
Our language is to shift

539
00:22:04.216 --> 00:22:08.442
from a masculine perspective language

540
00:22:08.442 --> 00:22:10.486
to a more feminine, a more round,

541
00:22:10.486 --> 00:22:15.486
a more whole language with awareness.

542
00:22:18.322 --> 00:22:19.727
<v Voiceover>Any final thoughts on this.</v>

543
00:22:19.727 --> 00:22:21.527
This is beautiful.

544
00:22:21.527 --> 00:22:26.527
<v ->Great love and great blessings to all, really.</v>

545
00:22:26.531 --> 00:22:30.037
I am delighted to do the work right now on the planet

546
00:22:30.037 --> 00:22:31.813
I wish (incoherent) was here.

547
00:22:31.813 --> 00:22:34.344
I wish mother would be here physically.

548
00:22:34.344 --> 00:22:36.817
Because this is the time of their work.

549
00:22:36.817 --> 00:22:38.547
And that's what I enjoy

550
00:22:38.547 --> 00:22:39.812
working with the cells,

551
00:22:39.812 --> 00:22:41.078
the mental body of the cells,

552
00:22:41.078 --> 00:22:43.052
the emotional body of the cells,

553
00:22:43.052 --> 00:22:44.538
working with the cell membrane,

554
00:22:44.538 --> 00:22:47.185
working with the DNA, RNA.

555
00:22:47.185 --> 00:22:49.193
This is, this is what I'm enjoying.

556
00:22:49.193 --> 00:22:51.388
And I'm coming to a place

557
00:22:51.388 --> 00:22:54.197
where I can see the telomeres

558
00:22:54.197 --> 00:22:57.494
of human have been so stressed or shortened

559
00:22:57.494 --> 00:23:00.641
that sometimes I choose a few students.

560
00:23:00.641 --> 00:23:02.638
I clear the stress,

561
00:23:02.638 --> 00:23:07.212
and I see like a telomeres just become longer.

562
00:23:07.212 --> 00:23:09.813
And they become younger.

563
00:23:09.813 --> 00:23:10.846
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

564
00:23:10.846 --> 00:23:12.912
And there is work in the world of science.

565
00:23:12.912 --> 00:23:14.677
The work of Patrick Flanagan and others.

566
00:23:14.677 --> 00:23:18.467
Working specifically with trying to sustain

567
00:23:18.467 --> 00:23:20.328
the lifespan of the telomeres,

568
00:23:20.328 --> 00:23:22.469
but if you don't have consciousness

569
00:23:22.469 --> 00:23:23.791
associated with it
<v Sai>Oh it won't work.</v>

570
00:23:23.791 --> 00:23:25.522
it's a whole different thing
<v Sai>It won't work.</v>

571
00:23:25.522 --> 00:23:28.861
<v ->And I hope that science doesn't bring</v>

572
00:23:28.861 --> 00:23:32.998
something where anybody can buy a product

573
00:23:32.998 --> 00:23:34.867
to lenghthen their telomeres.

574
00:23:34.867 --> 00:23:37.038
Because I tell you one thing,

575
00:23:37.038 --> 00:23:38.977
anybody will buy this product.

576
00:23:38.977 --> 00:23:41.496
They will get money to buy it,

577
00:23:41.496 --> 00:23:43.598
but their consciousness will not change.

578
00:23:43.598 --> 00:23:46.848
So they will be immortal beings with ego stuff.

579
00:23:46.848 --> 00:23:49.855
Then they will be worse on the planet.

580
00:23:49.855 --> 00:23:51.818
<v Voiceover>Why don't you go ahead and explain and set up</v>

581
00:23:51.818 --> 00:23:52.584
what talomeres are.

582
00:23:52.584 --> 00:23:54.093
So people will understand what you're talking about.

583
00:23:54.093 --> 00:23:56.392
<v ->It's about DNA</v>

584
00:23:56.392 --> 00:24:00.281
and (incoherent) contained in their DNA.

585
00:24:00.281 --> 00:24:01.825
Which we all carry.

586
00:24:01.825 --> 00:24:04.705
We have the good, the non good,

587
00:24:04.705 --> 00:24:06.829
the light, the non-light.

588
00:24:06.829 --> 00:24:08.234
When the telomeres,

589
00:24:08.234 --> 00:24:09.558
when we are born the telomeres

590
00:24:09.558 --> 00:24:12.007
has a certain length.

591
00:24:12.007 --> 00:24:14.480
The more stress the people go trough,

592
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.640
the telomere contracts itself,

593
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.519
because there is only two energies on this planet.

594
00:24:19.519 --> 00:24:21.713
One is love, expansion.

595
00:24:21.713 --> 00:24:24.453
One is fear, contraction.

596
00:24:24.453 --> 00:24:27.750
So now, I in the work,

597
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:28.819
whatever I'm telling you

598
00:24:28.819 --> 00:24:31.094
I go through my meditation.

599
00:24:31.094 --> 00:24:33.532
When the human grows

600
00:24:33.532 --> 00:24:36.887
this telomere gets shortened.

601
00:24:36.887 --> 00:24:38.304
The DNA get confused.

602
00:24:38.304 --> 00:24:39.500
It just doesn't know what to do,

603
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.568
what not to do.

604
00:24:40.568 --> 00:24:45.340
Or the storeroom is filled with fear instead of love

605
00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.579
through all the experience they go through.

606
00:24:48.579 --> 00:24:50.664
When the energy of love and light,

607
00:24:50.664 --> 00:24:51.946
through meditation,

608
00:24:51.946 --> 00:24:52.607
when we bring

609
00:24:52.607 --> 00:24:57.251
the consciousness of the ascended masters for instance,

610
00:24:57.251 --> 00:25:00.850
we can lengthen this telomeres.

611
00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:05.850
My concern is, if I put a remedy out,

612
00:25:06.992 --> 00:25:09.395
I do create drops and gases

613
00:25:09.395 --> 00:25:11.868
to give to the students, all kind of device.

614
00:25:11.868 --> 00:25:14.434
I enjoy this work.

615
00:25:14.434 --> 00:25:17.070
If somebody who has a big ego,

616
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:18.741
takes money, buy this product,

617
00:25:18.741 --> 00:25:22.213
get a long telomeres, will live for years.

618
00:25:22.213 --> 00:25:26.183
I work with mostly antigravity.

619
00:25:26.183 --> 00:25:28.482
What can we create in the planet?

620
00:25:28.482 --> 00:25:30.317
<v Voiceover>That's again consciousness.</v>

621
00:25:30.317 --> 00:25:31.617
<v ->That's again consciousness.</v>

622
00:25:31.617 --> 00:25:35.460
I agree with the teomeres, but love is first.

623
00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.027
Do not destroy yourself,

624
00:25:37.027 --> 00:25:39.326
and do not destroy anybody.

625
00:25:39.326 --> 00:25:42.194
Do not hold on to resentment,

626
00:25:42.194 --> 00:25:46.838
to expectation, to rage, to hatred, to fear.

627
00:25:46.838 --> 00:25:50.204
The fear of death, the fear of the unknown.

628
00:25:50.204 --> 00:25:52.373
<v Voiceover>Yes, Well.</v>

629
00:25:52.373 --> 00:25:55.034
<v ->And anyway, we are not the body.</v>

630
00:25:55.034 --> 00:25:56.439
The body is a house.

631
00:25:56.439 --> 00:25:59.283
It's a clothe, so let's take good care of it,

632
00:25:59.283 --> 00:26:01.280
but realizing that we are

633
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.115
pure energy inside,

634
00:26:03.115 --> 00:26:05.576
and let's work with this energy and consciousness.

635
00:26:05.576 --> 00:26:10.499
<v Voiceover>The DVD, the brain illumination DVD</v>

636
00:26:10.499 --> 00:26:13.900
is really wonderful in helping bring a lot of this to light.

637
00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.723
I just want to say that once again.

638
00:26:15.723 --> 00:26:16.698
I think its beautiful.

639
00:26:16.698 --> 00:26:17.987
That's another tool
<v Sai>This is experience</v>

640
00:26:17.987 --> 00:26:18.756
people can work with,
<v Sai>that happen to me</v>

641
00:26:18.756 --> 00:26:19.479
very simple.
<v Sai>while I'm</v>

642
00:26:19.479 --> 00:26:22.387
Yes
<v Sai>with my guru, so.</v>

643
00:26:22.387 --> 00:26:25.905
And it's very accessible to every human being

644
00:26:25.905 --> 00:26:26.776
if you choose to commit

645
00:26:26.776 --> 00:26:28.808
to working with it.
<v Sai>We have these pockets</v>

646
00:26:28.808 --> 00:26:32.012
<v ->in our brains and when they're healed</v>

647
00:26:32.012 --> 00:26:35.588
it's easier and life just becomes more clear.

648
00:26:35.588 --> 00:26:38.049
Experience of life becomes more divined.

649
00:26:38.049 --> 00:26:40.255
<v Voiceover>That is one very practical way</v>

650
00:26:40.255 --> 00:26:42.577
people can begin to start refining.

651
00:26:42.577 --> 00:26:45.422
<v ->There's another DVD and CD I think</v>

652
00:26:45.422 --> 00:26:50.298
where I talk of entities and Kharma,

653
00:26:50.298 --> 00:26:53.897
or real versus unreal.

654
00:26:53.897 --> 00:26:55.905
<v Voiceover>Okay, and everyone will be</v>

655
00:26:55.905 --> 00:26:57.867
having access to your website
<v Sai>Oh yes.</v>

656
00:26:57.867 --> 00:26:58.866
after this so they can,

657
00:26:58.866 --> 00:27:00.271
Everyone just find your way there.

658
00:27:00.271 --> 00:27:02.349
Once again, we're about out of time,

659
00:27:02.349 --> 00:27:03.475
and I thank you so much

660
00:27:03.475 --> 00:27:06.319
for your lovely presence today.

661
00:27:06.319 --> 00:27:09.617
<v ->I'm so delighted that I get to see you again.</v>

662
00:27:09.617 --> 00:27:11.683
Thank you and great blessings

663
00:27:11.683 --> 00:27:13.820
with great, great love.

664
00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:16.490
May you all know that place

665
00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:18.858
of love and light within,

666
00:27:18.858 --> 00:27:21.192
the grace within,

667
00:27:21.192 --> 00:27:23.363
and live in that expansion

668
00:27:23.363 --> 00:27:27.299
of immortality, of eternity.

669
00:27:27.299 --> 00:27:32.067
(chanting)

670
00:27:33.777 --> 00:27:36.505
Blessings to all of you.

671
00:27:36.505 --> 00:27:41.505
(soundscape music)

672
00:27:42.485 --> 00:27:43.738
<v ->The brain illumination DVD</v>

673
00:27:43.738 --> 00:27:45.387
I was referring to just a bit ago

674
00:27:45.387 --> 00:27:46.118
in the interview,

675
00:27:46.118 --> 00:27:47.988
is available through Sai Maa's website,

676
00:27:47.988 --> 00:27:50.356
at humanityandunity.org.

677
00:27:50.356 --> 00:27:52.562
It's a wonderful tool for awakening the mind

678
00:27:52.562 --> 00:27:54.663
and creating unity within.

679
00:27:54.663 --> 00:27:56.335
We'll be speaking again with Sai Maa

680
00:27:56.335 --> 00:27:57.531
in the months to come.

681
00:27:57.531 --> 00:27:58.495
Until next time.

682
00:27:58.495 --> 00:28:03.495
Thanks for watching CMN.
