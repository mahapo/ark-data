00:00:01.085 --> 00:00:02.757
<v ->You learned in part one, what led up</v>

2
00:00:02.757 --> 00:00:05.659
to Ron Davis' epiphany as a dyslexic.

3
00:00:05.659 --> 00:00:08.434
In this interview, he explains what it's like

4
00:00:08.434 --> 00:00:11.639
to be inside the head of a dyslexic and autistic

5
00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.377
and how a dyslexic can turn their trait off and on.

6
00:00:15.377 --> 00:00:17.072
This, in turn, leads him to the topic

7
00:00:17.072 --> 00:00:18.976
of our educational system,

8
00:00:18.976 --> 00:00:20.509
and how it is not meeting the needs

9
00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.760
of the kinds of children being born today.

10
00:00:33.224 --> 00:00:37.055
Interesting is what's happening as a result

11
00:00:37.055 --> 00:00:41.102
of the interface between kids

12
00:00:41.102 --> 00:00:42.402
and computer games

13
00:00:42.402 --> 00:00:44.399
starting back even about 15 years ago

14
00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.172
when MTV first started coming on and Pong,

15
00:00:48.172 --> 00:00:51.945
which was the beginning of the shortening of images

16
00:00:51.945 --> 00:00:54.474
where our brain was only getting...

17
00:00:54.474 --> 00:00:57.585
In my video industry, I know this because

18
00:00:57.585 --> 00:00:59.512
we used to have long dreamy shots

19
00:00:59.512 --> 00:01:00.848
years ago when we were producing.

20
00:01:00.848 --> 00:01:02.148
They got shorter and shorter.

21
00:01:02.148 --> 00:01:03.483
By the time MTV came along,

22
00:01:03.483 --> 00:01:05.155
you were talking about a 10-frame shots,

23
00:01:05.155 --> 00:01:07.930
a third of a second, one after another.

24
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.711
With the kids watching this,

25
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:14.124
it had to have impacted the way their brains developed.

26
00:01:14.124 --> 00:01:16.135
It's chicken or egg.

27
00:01:16.135 --> 00:01:16.434
<v ->Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:16.434 --> 00:01:17.267
<v Voiceover>Are they accommodating it</v>

29
00:01:17.267 --> 00:01:19.473
because that's how fast the brain's already operating

30
00:01:19.473 --> 00:01:21.806
and now it's lightning speeds where...

31
00:01:21.806 --> 00:01:23.908
I'm watching my nephew, for example,

32
00:01:23.908 --> 00:01:27.576
with one of the new video, sophisticated video games

33
00:01:27.576 --> 00:01:30.142
where I can see his brain is entrained

34
00:01:30.142 --> 00:01:32.441
and he's in an altered state and he does this.

35
00:01:32.441 --> 00:01:33.381
It's all he wants to do.

36
00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:35.216
Schoolwork for these kids means nothing.

37
00:01:35.216 --> 00:01:36.621
They want to live in this world.

38
00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:37.085
<v ->Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:37.085 --> 00:01:38.583
<v Voiceover>Where they're going to the next level</v>

40
00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:40.789
where things are moving at lightning speed.

41
00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.890
What's happening with this?

42
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.267
<v ->Well, when we are thinking with images,</v>

43
00:01:47.267 --> 00:01:49.383
and all human beings do,

44
00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:53.104
when we're doing it naturally, we're not aware

45
00:01:53.104 --> 00:01:54.404
of the process.

46
00:01:54.404 --> 00:01:57.968
We're not aware of what it is we're actually thinking.

47
00:01:57.968 --> 00:02:00.406
We're aware of a product of the thought,

48
00:02:00.406 --> 00:02:02.183
but not of the thought itself.

49
00:02:02.183 --> 00:02:05.564
And the reason for that is the speed at which it occurs.

50
00:02:06.812 --> 00:02:09.157
When we slow this thought process down

51
00:02:09.157 --> 00:02:13.360
and try to analyze it, what's occuring is the individual

52
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.961
is thinking with individual pictures,

53
00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:19.928
and there are 32 individual frames per second.

54
00:02:19.928 --> 00:02:22.494
<v Voiceover>Just like video, 30 frames per second.</v>

55
00:02:22.494 --> 00:02:23.167
Interesting.

56
00:02:23.167 --> 00:02:25.370
<v ->They can do them one at a time.</v>

57
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.972
But the thing is they wouldn't understand

58
00:02:26.972 --> 00:02:29.039
what it is that they were doing.

59
00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:31.570
Because we cannot be aware of anything

60
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.713
that happens faster than 24 in a second.

61
00:02:34.713 --> 00:02:36.814
This is happening 32 in a second.

62
00:02:36.814 --> 00:02:40.146
So it fits in to what's called the subliminal band.

63
00:02:40.146 --> 00:02:42.816
When we are thinking non-verbally,

64
00:02:42.816 --> 00:02:44.860
we are subliminally thinking.

65
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.925
We're not aware of what it is that's going on.

66
00:02:47.925 --> 00:02:51.433
So, if what happens is,

67
00:02:51.433 --> 00:02:54.902
we get used to the stimuli

68
00:02:54.902 --> 00:02:57.200
that comes from it being rapid.

69
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.867
If we're not overwhelmed by it.

70
00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:01.829
And the brilliance of all of this

71
00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.664
is the way it's set up,

72
00:03:03.664 --> 00:03:06.740
is that it's very hard for you to become

73
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.643
overwhelmed by it in the beginning.

74
00:03:09.643 --> 00:03:11.849
So, you start out with it being slow

75
00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.078
and then you control how fast it goes

76
00:03:14.078 --> 00:03:17.619
and eventually, you're just absolutely flying.

77
00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:22.425
What is occurring is, their brain chemistry is (mumbling),

78
00:03:22.425 --> 00:03:24.898
probably in the form of endorphins,

79
00:03:24.898 --> 00:03:29.754
from the amount of stimuli that we are receiving.

80
00:03:30.317 --> 00:03:32.836
Those endorphins are a lot like drugs.

81
00:03:32.836 --> 00:03:35.472
In fact, they are the natural drug store.

82
00:03:35.472 --> 00:03:40.472
And we are actually becoming addicted

83
00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:47.471
to a need for greater and faster stimuli.

84
00:03:47.546 --> 00:03:49.885
And that's, I think, what it is that you're seeing.

85
00:03:49.885 --> 00:03:53.925
What should occur is the education system

86
00:03:53.925 --> 00:03:57.980
should look at what Nintendo does

87
00:03:58.693 --> 00:04:01.811
to find out what it is that they are doing wrong.

88
00:04:02.594 --> 00:04:06.263
because there are certain things that Nintendo does

89
00:04:06.263 --> 00:04:09.335
that will get the child to sit there

90
00:04:09.335 --> 00:04:11.955
to the point where they won't even go eat.

91
00:04:13.074 --> 00:04:14.108
<v Voiceover>They've lost track of time.</v>

92
00:04:14.108 --> 00:04:16.914
<v ->They don't want to school.</v>

93
00:04:16.914 --> 00:04:18.313
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

94
00:04:18.313 --> 00:04:20.975
<v ->The magic that Nintendo does is first of all,</v>

95
00:04:20.975 --> 00:04:24.232
it challenges the skill of the individual.

96
00:04:24.783 --> 00:04:27.445
And there is no penalty for failure.

97
00:04:28.321 --> 00:04:32.582
And it also has stimulated the curiosity

98
00:04:32.582 --> 00:04:36.297
or stimulated some positive emotion in the individual

99
00:04:36.297 --> 00:04:39.374
where at school, the only emotion

100
00:04:39.374 --> 00:04:42.585
that gets stimulated at school is boredom.

101
00:04:44.308 --> 00:04:48.123
And there is penalty for failure at school.

102
00:04:49.417 --> 00:04:50.377
<v Voiceover>So how will we, since</v>

103
00:04:50.377 --> 00:04:52.954
that is the popular norm,

104
00:04:52.954 --> 00:04:56.879
how are we going to even begin bridging

105
00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.491
what appears to be rapidly becoming

106
00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:01.209
an antiquated system of learning

107
00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:04.011
with the new technologies available?

108
00:05:08.428 --> 00:05:09.798
<v ->There are two answer that I can give.</v>

109
00:05:09.798 --> 00:05:12.132
There's a very cynical, honest one

110
00:05:12.132 --> 00:05:14.500
and then there's the political correct one.

111
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.799
Which one do you want?

112
00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:15.461
<v Voiceover>Would you give us both?</v>

113
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:16.970
How about the honest one?

114
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.581
<v ->The honest one is, if we look at who it is</v>

115
00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:24.250
that is financing education, right,

116
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.514
it comes from the state government

117
00:05:26.514 --> 00:05:28.789
and also through the federal government

118
00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.924
and the decision was made by the federal government

119
00:05:31.924 --> 00:05:35.212
that education in America was going to be free.

120
00:05:36.228 --> 00:05:40.523
If you go back and look at the congressional records,

121
00:05:40.523 --> 00:05:43.391
the speeches that were given to the congressmen

122
00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:48.250
and the legislatures, legislator, legislators

123
00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:53.608
at the time when these decisions were going to be made,

124
00:05:53.608 --> 00:05:55.849
you would then begin to understand

125
00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:58.783
what the purpose of education in America today is.

126
00:05:58.783 --> 00:05:59.816
<v Voiceover>What is that?</v>

127
00:05:59.816 --> 00:06:02.591
<v ->Yeah, see you went through the system</v>

128
00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:04.181
and you don't even know what is.

129
00:06:04.181 --> 00:06:05.273
<v Voiceover>No, not very successful.</v>

130
00:06:05.273 --> 00:06:06.027
I was born (mumbling).

131
00:06:06.027 --> 00:06:08.326
<v ->You can ask the teachers what the</v>

132
00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:10.822
purpose of education is, they can't tell you.

133
00:06:11.446 --> 00:06:13.466
They will give you a purpose, but it is not one

134
00:06:13.466 --> 00:06:15.161
that is universally agreed upon.

135
00:06:15.161 --> 00:06:17.367
And it certainly isn't the purpose that the

136
00:06:17.367 --> 00:06:21.445
people that pay the bill have for providing it.

137
00:06:21.868 --> 00:06:24.411
The purpose for education in America

138
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:29.148
is to provide controllable, docile citizens

139
00:06:29.148 --> 00:06:31.783
that are willing to give up their lives

140
00:06:31.783 --> 00:06:33.716
for the lies of the government.

141
00:06:33.716 --> 00:06:35.852
That's the purpose of education.

142
00:06:35.852 --> 00:06:38.325
And as long as that is the purpose for education,

143
00:06:38.325 --> 00:06:39.657
we're not going to have a very good one.

144
00:06:39.657 --> 00:06:40.122
Why?

145
00:06:40.122 --> 00:06:42.316
Because what we've already got

146
00:06:42.316 --> 00:06:44.696
is enough to fill up the military.

147
00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:47.529
And the rest of us are too docile to make any changes.

148
00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:50.930
So, the people that are paying the bills

149
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.904
are getting exactly what it is that they want

150
00:06:52.904 --> 00:06:57.142
and everything else is just smoke screen and lip service.

151
00:06:57.142 --> 00:06:59.336
The very first thing that would have to happen,

152
00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:01.472
if we're going to see any change at all,

153
00:07:01.472 --> 00:07:04.282
of any value at all in education,

154
00:07:04.282 --> 00:07:08.415
we have to insist that our legislators

155
00:07:09.152 --> 00:07:12.485
come up with the purpose of education

156
00:07:12.485 --> 00:07:13.924
in America today.

157
00:07:13.924 --> 00:07:16.861
And every teacher, every school administrator

158
00:07:16.861 --> 00:07:20.995
and every student needs to know what that purpose is.

159
00:07:20.995 --> 00:07:23.700
And from that purpose, then we can establish goals

160
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.972
that we can meet to enhance the fact

161
00:07:27.972 --> 00:07:30.143
that that purpose is being satisfied.

162
00:07:30.143 --> 00:07:32.547
And there should only be one purpose for education

163
00:07:32.547 --> 00:07:36.271
and that is to prepare a human being for the future.

164
00:07:36.271 --> 00:07:38.604
That should be the only reason for education.

165
00:07:38.604 --> 00:07:41.568
Otherwise, why bother us with it?

166
00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:44.348
<v Voiceover>Seems like an extremely</v>

167
00:07:44.348 --> 00:07:46.124
antiquated system already, doesn't it?

168
00:07:46.124 --> 00:07:49.352
<v ->Yeah, well, if you really understand the history of it.</v>

169
00:07:49.352 --> 00:07:50.292
<v Voiceover>It always was.</v>

170
00:07:50.292 --> 00:07:53.357
<v ->If the American Central Intelligence Agency</v>

171
00:07:53.357 --> 00:07:54.994
came to me and asked me to create

172
00:07:54.994 --> 00:07:59.627
a brainwashing system that we could

173
00:07:59.627 --> 00:08:02.210
subject all of the people in America to,

174
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.533
that would ensure that we would have

175
00:08:03.533 --> 00:08:05.739
a controllable, docile citizenry

176
00:08:05.739 --> 00:08:07.736
that are willing to go to war,

177
00:08:07.736 --> 00:08:09.141
you couldn't come up with a better system

178
00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:11.579
than the one they've already got in place.

179
00:08:11.579 --> 00:08:13.646
It is a perfect system for that.

180
00:08:13.646 --> 00:08:15.190
<v Voiceover>So what is inevitably going to happen</v>

181
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.349
then because now the kids have already

182
00:08:17.349 --> 00:08:19.486
pushed beyond that point?

183
00:08:19.486 --> 00:08:22.937
<v ->Well, the future is not going to tolerate it.</v>

184
00:08:23.731 --> 00:08:27.899
That might be an OK system for individuals

185
00:08:27.899 --> 00:08:30.036
who are not capable of thinking,

186
00:08:30.036 --> 00:08:34.401
but when you have a population that can think

187
00:08:34.401 --> 00:08:38.871
with the 30 concepts that create

188
00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:41.541
the concept of responsibility,

189
00:08:41.541 --> 00:08:43.709
things are going to change.

190
00:08:43.709 --> 00:08:44.743
They have to change.

191
00:08:44.743 --> 00:08:46.354
<v Voiceover>Are they already beginning to change?</v>

192
00:08:46.354 --> 00:08:46.780
<v ->No.</v>

193
00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:47.953
<v Voiceover>Are you seeing huge disruptions</v>

194
00:08:47.953 --> 00:08:48.612
yet in the way--

195
00:08:48.612 --> 00:08:49.480
<v ->No, no.</v>

196
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.339
<v Voiceover>Not yet.</v>

197
00:08:50.339 --> 00:08:51.186
<v ->Why?</v>

198
00:08:51.186 --> 00:08:53.787
Because the individuals that are

199
00:08:53.787 --> 00:08:55.053
going to be making those changes

200
00:08:55.053 --> 00:08:58.028
are still considered that there's something wrong with them.

201
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:05.621
Our society is not geared for change.

202
00:09:08.773 --> 00:09:13.420
We're seeing an evolution in the human species,

203
00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:18.313
but the society itself is going to have to

204
00:09:18.313 --> 00:09:20.334
also go through a evolution.

205
00:09:21.744 --> 00:09:24.147
But the easiest way to change the society

206
00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:27.056
is to change the individuals who are in society.

207
00:09:28.823 --> 00:09:30.492
You can't have responsible government

208
00:09:30.492 --> 00:09:33.313
until the people in government are responsible.

209
00:09:34.163 --> 00:09:36.029
<v Voiceover>That's not happening yet.</v>

210
00:09:36.029 --> 00:09:37.112
<v ->Well...</v>

211
00:09:38.696 --> 00:09:41.564
Luckily that's not an area that I

212
00:09:41.564 --> 00:09:43.944
have to waste any time on.

213
00:09:43.944 --> 00:09:46.371
My job is in a different arena.

214
00:09:46.371 --> 00:09:48.739
A place where I'm a lot more comfortable.

215
00:09:48.739 --> 00:09:50.051
But there are people that are going

216
00:09:50.051 --> 00:09:52.953
to have to address it sometime in the future.

217
00:09:52.953 --> 00:09:55.183
Luckily, I won't even be around

218
00:09:55.183 --> 00:09:56.645
to see it occur.

219
00:09:56.645 --> 00:09:59.304
I don't have to endure anymore of it.

220
00:10:00.494 --> 00:10:03.408
<v Voiceover>So what do you recommend at this point</v>

221
00:10:04.499 --> 00:10:07.181
for people who have these kids who are

222
00:10:07.181 --> 00:10:11.662
already deeply ensconced in the world of technology,

223
00:10:11.662 --> 00:10:13.241
who are bored out of their gourds,

224
00:10:13.241 --> 00:10:15.934
who want to move at lightning speed,

225
00:10:15.934 --> 00:10:18.535
who are creative by nature.

226
00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:19.905
What do we do now?

227
00:10:19.905 --> 00:10:21.972
There are millions of them.

228
00:10:21.972 --> 00:10:25.063
<v ->One of the things that we have to realize</v>

229
00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:27.580
when we cause a change to occur

230
00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.689
is that we have to live with the consequence of the change.

231
00:10:30.689 --> 00:10:33.487
We have to adapt to the effect.

232
00:10:33.487 --> 00:10:36.784
You and I would have difficulty adapting to it

233
00:10:36.784 --> 00:10:38.258
simply because of the number of years

234
00:10:38.258 --> 00:10:39.593
that we have been alive,

235
00:10:39.593 --> 00:10:41.300
and we don't have that early training

236
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.829
of the amount of stimuli that they are experiencing.

237
00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:48.837
So, we can't see that change

238
00:10:48.837 --> 00:10:51.438
as being something that is negative,

239
00:10:51.438 --> 00:10:53.376
simply because it would be difficult for us

240
00:10:53.376 --> 00:10:54.909
to deal with that.

241
00:10:54.909 --> 00:10:58.938
But, we also have to live with the consequence

242
00:10:58.938 --> 00:11:01.930
and it's a lot like, you know the--

243
00:11:02.481 --> 00:11:05.291
In my childhood, rock and roll music

244
00:11:05.291 --> 00:11:08.173
was supposed to destroy the human race.

245
00:11:08.794 --> 00:11:10.541
It didn't happen.

246
00:11:10.988 --> 00:11:14.935
So, we can say, OK, we see these changes happening

247
00:11:14.935 --> 00:11:17.687
in the human race and my God,

248
00:11:17.687 --> 00:11:19.266
it would destroy the human race.

249
00:11:19.266 --> 00:11:23.347
That also, is not going to happen.

250
00:11:25.671 --> 00:11:28.249
It's either going to get better

251
00:11:28.249 --> 00:11:29.607
or it's going to disappear.

252
00:11:29.607 --> 00:11:32.544
I mean, that's the law of nature.

253
00:11:32.544 --> 00:11:36.915
If you cannot adapt, then you're going to succumb.

254
00:11:36.915 --> 00:11:39.005
<v Voiceover>What's our first step in adaptation?</v>

255
00:11:39.005 --> 00:11:42.523
Let's say that adaptation is desirable over succumbing.

256
00:11:42.523 --> 00:11:44.357
<v ->If we're talking about addressing</v>

257
00:11:44.357 --> 00:11:47.024
something like autism, you have to eliminate

258
00:11:47.024 --> 00:11:50.194
the reason why the problem exists.

259
00:11:50.194 --> 00:11:52.272
And the reason the problem exists,

260
00:11:52.272 --> 00:11:57.067
in my opinion, is that there is a genetic change

261
00:11:57.838 --> 00:12:01.643
that has forgotten about one of the

262
00:12:01.643 --> 00:12:03.872
early instincts that we have to have

263
00:12:03.872 --> 00:12:06.241
in order to become a real human being.

264
00:12:06.241 --> 00:12:08.350
We can add that part that's missing.

265
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.984
It's not going to be that difficult to do.

266
00:12:09.984 --> 00:12:12.724
<v Voiceover>Is that the socialization part?</v>

267
00:12:12.724 --> 00:12:13.955
Those basic instincts?

268
00:12:13.955 --> 00:12:18.955
<v ->Well, if we look at what it is to be a human being,</v>

269
00:12:19.226 --> 00:12:22.409
when we first come into this life,

270
00:12:23.135 --> 00:12:25.166
I think we all come from the same place.

271
00:12:25.166 --> 00:12:27.059
I got to stay there a little longer so,

272
00:12:27.059 --> 00:12:29.567
I got a little more familiar with it.

273
00:12:29.567 --> 00:12:31.610
We come from everything and nothing,

274
00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.812
the void that is

275
00:12:35.246 --> 00:12:37.591
both the penalty and the reward.

276
00:12:38.943 --> 00:12:41.312
And the first job that we have to do

277
00:12:41.312 --> 00:12:42.554
in order to become a human being

278
00:12:42.554 --> 00:12:45.387
is we have to individuate into one of these things.

279
00:12:45.387 --> 00:12:47.593
We have to figure out how to make it wiggle

280
00:12:47.593 --> 00:12:48.649
the way we want it to wiggle.

281
00:12:48.649 --> 00:12:51.180
We have to figure out how to get the perception

282
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.466
to be accurate.

283
00:12:52.466 --> 00:12:54.695
I mean, what our eyes see is upside down

284
00:12:54.695 --> 00:12:56.632
to what it is our brain sees.

285
00:12:56.632 --> 00:12:59.859
We have to be able to make that adaptation.

286
00:12:59.859 --> 00:13:02.007
We have to also be able to get our brains

287
00:13:02.007 --> 00:13:03.969
to hear the sounds coming from the same place

288
00:13:03.969 --> 00:13:07.191
where I see that it's coming from.

289
00:13:07.441 --> 00:13:10.308
So we have to go through this individuation stage

290
00:13:10.308 --> 00:13:14.860
and it takes about two years to be fully completed.

291
00:13:14.882 --> 00:13:17.301
(background coughing)

292
00:13:17.991 --> 00:13:20.276
Then the next step that we have to do,

293
00:13:20.276 --> 00:13:22.029
once we become one of these things,

294
00:13:22.029 --> 00:13:23.828
then we have to create an identity

295
00:13:23.828 --> 00:13:26.083
for this thing that we have become.

296
00:13:26.623 --> 00:13:31.267
So, we have to go through the process of creating

297
00:13:31.267 --> 00:13:35.450
an identity for the individual

298
00:13:35.873 --> 00:13:37.069
and it has to be something that

299
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:39.322
a two-year-old child could do.

300
00:13:40.476 --> 00:13:42.682
Therefore, it has to be driven by some kind of

301
00:13:42.682 --> 00:13:46.099
a natural instinct for us to do this.

302
00:13:46.511 --> 00:13:49.778
And analyzing this,

303
00:13:49.778 --> 00:13:52.240
the way we create our identity,

304
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.091
it starts with opinions.

305
00:13:56.091 --> 00:13:57.562
There are very simple opinions like,

306
00:13:57.562 --> 00:14:01.065
"I want a cookie" or "I want to go,"

307
00:14:01.065 --> 00:14:04.858
and an opinion that is satisfied

308
00:14:04.858 --> 00:14:06.368
doesn't create any identity.

309
00:14:06.368 --> 00:14:07.888
It has to be an opinion that is

310
00:14:07.888 --> 00:14:09.839
an opposed opinion.

311
00:14:09.839 --> 00:14:11.569
The child says, "I want a cookie," and the mom says,

312
00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:12.974
"Well, you can't have a cookie."

313
00:14:12.974 --> 00:14:13.810
"I want a cookie."

314
00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.461
"Can't have a cookie."

315
00:14:16.012 --> 00:14:19.231
As simple as this mechanical piece is,

316
00:14:20.153 --> 00:14:22.789
because the individual is experiencing

317
00:14:22.789 --> 00:14:26.725
an opinion and an opposing opinion at the same time,

318
00:14:26.725 --> 00:14:29.736
it creates a magical thing where

319
00:14:29.736 --> 00:14:33.559
it now goes through time with the individual.

320
00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:35.661
If this weren't occurring, we would be like

321
00:14:35.661 --> 00:14:37.727
cows and horses and dogs and cats

322
00:14:37.727 --> 00:14:39.774
living only in the moment.

323
00:14:40.836 --> 00:14:42.902
But what we do, is we have the ability

324
00:14:42.902 --> 00:14:45.021
to take the past with us

325
00:14:45.665 --> 00:14:47.906
by creating a little piece of a core identity

326
00:14:47.906 --> 00:14:49.346
that is composed of nothing more

327
00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:53.015
than an opinion and an opposing opinion.

328
00:14:53.015 --> 00:14:55.255
Then, anything in the future that we encounter

329
00:14:55.255 --> 00:14:59.575
that either supports or invalidates that gets stuck to it.

330
00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.792
And that is our real identity.

331
00:15:02.792 --> 00:15:05.393
So we have these little bit and pieces of core identity

332
00:15:05.393 --> 00:15:07.459
and we might only have, I don't know,

333
00:15:07.459 --> 00:15:09.363
50 or 60, we might have over 100,

334
00:15:09.363 --> 00:15:11.233
little pieces of core identity

335
00:15:11.233 --> 00:15:13.624
that other pieces get stuck to.

336
00:15:14.968 --> 00:15:18.579
Everything that we know is stuck to one of those things.

337
00:15:18.579 --> 00:15:21.377
Every experience that you've ever had in your life

338
00:15:21.377 --> 00:15:24.166
is stuck to one of those little cores somewhere.

339
00:15:24.938 --> 00:15:26.412
Everything that you have learned

340
00:15:26.412 --> 00:15:29.158
is also stuck to one of those little cores.

341
00:15:32.122 --> 00:15:36.220
Every behavior that you manifest

342
00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.993
is manifested to support your identity.

343
00:15:39.993 --> 00:15:43.233
You don't do anything that doesn't support your identity.

344
00:15:43.233 --> 00:15:46.233
This is why behavior modification does not work

345
00:15:46.233 --> 00:15:48.991
because it doesn't alter the identity.

346
00:15:49.577 --> 00:15:51.539
If you want to change somebody's behavior,

347
00:15:51.539 --> 00:15:53.303
the only way you can do it is you have to

348
00:15:53.303 --> 00:15:54.778
change their identity,

349
00:15:54.778 --> 00:15:56.612
and have them have an identity

350
00:15:56.612 --> 00:15:57.982
that doesn't need that behavior.

351
00:15:57.982 --> 00:16:00.420
And then it disappears.

352
00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.777
The other thing that we noticed,

353
00:16:02.777 --> 00:16:06.258
is that a person's intellect or intelligence

354
00:16:06.258 --> 00:16:08.394
is simply a reflection of our identity.

355
00:16:08.394 --> 00:16:11.798
Intelligence as a thing doesn't not exist.

356
00:16:12.059 --> 00:16:14.355
It is simply a reflection of the identity

357
00:16:14.355 --> 00:16:15.562
of the individual.

358
00:16:15.562 --> 00:16:17.768
The more identity the individual has,

359
00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:19.463
the more intellect they have to have

360
00:16:19.463 --> 00:16:21.704
in order to support the identity.

361
00:16:21.704 --> 00:16:26.069
So, intelligence isn't something that we're born with.

362
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:28.008
It has nothing to do with how big your brain is

363
00:16:28.008 --> 00:16:30.214
or how fast the synapse work.

364
00:16:30.214 --> 00:16:32.315
It has to do with the identity

365
00:16:32.315 --> 00:16:35.503
that you have created of who you are.

366
00:16:36.147 --> 00:16:38.620
<v Voiceover>So then, if we have 500 percent increase</v>

367
00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.220
in these individuals with off-the-chart

368
00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:46.220
quote IQs that are also labeled as autistic.

369
00:16:48.095 --> 00:16:49.163
How does this fit in?

370
00:16:49.163 --> 00:16:51.067
Is this coming in almost as a,

371
00:16:51.067 --> 00:16:53.173
just a pure awareness without

372
00:16:53.173 --> 00:16:55.091
a setup identity?

373
00:16:55.091 --> 00:16:58.597
<v ->Well, they don't have that unless you interfere with it.</v>

374
00:16:58.597 --> 00:17:01.778
Unless you add the pieces that are missing.

375
00:17:01.778 --> 00:17:04.541
The longer it takes for you to create

376
00:17:04.541 --> 00:17:07.246
the core identity, the more identity

377
00:17:07.246 --> 00:17:09.440
you're going to wind up having.

378
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.723
So, the thing is that

379
00:17:12.723 --> 00:17:16.612
they don't finish that first step.

380
00:17:16.612 --> 00:17:20.258
They're still stuck somewhere in the process

381
00:17:20.258 --> 00:17:22.266
of individuality.

382
00:17:22.266 --> 00:17:24.882
They are going to be very,

383
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:26.930
how would I say it?

384
00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.602
They're going to be still a little bit of

385
00:17:28.602 --> 00:17:30.097
everything and nothing at the same time.

386
00:17:30.097 --> 00:17:32.102
<v Voiceover>So, they're basically in a</v>

387
00:17:32.102 --> 00:17:34.447
lengthened state of this pure awareness.

388
00:17:34.447 --> 00:17:35.875
Like you say, this heightened senses

389
00:17:35.875 --> 00:17:38.546
and heightened awareness

390
00:17:38.546 --> 00:17:40.978
for many more years than an infant, for instance.

391
00:17:40.978 --> 00:17:43.579
<v ->But, see, we don't have to give them that either.</v>

392
00:17:43.579 --> 00:17:46.191
We can work with them at the age of two,

393
00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:47.886
and still accomplish everything that we need

394
00:17:47.886 --> 00:17:50.429
as long as we know that what we have to do

395
00:17:50.429 --> 00:17:52.089
is we have to build core identity

396
00:17:52.089 --> 00:17:55.215
and then we can build identity on that core.

397
00:17:55.533 --> 00:17:59.667
See, you can either have bigger core identity pieces

398
00:17:59.667 --> 00:18:02.491
or more core identity pieces.

399
00:18:02.961 --> 00:18:05.399
It doesn't really matter which is which.

400
00:18:05.399 --> 00:18:08.879
So, the experiment that we're doing is with

401
00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:12.142
more core identity pieces

402
00:18:12.142 --> 00:18:16.345
and also more added to the core identity pieces

403
00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:18.856
that is actually reality.

404
00:18:21.079 --> 00:18:23.853
<v Voiceover>So, autism, unlocking the secrets</v>

405
00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:25.966
of autism at this point.

406
00:18:25.966 --> 00:18:28.393
You've unlocked an awful lot of the secrets

407
00:18:28.393 --> 00:18:31.829
of dyslexia already and ADD behavior

408
00:18:31.829 --> 00:18:33.641
and you have an institute that is...

409
00:18:33.641 --> 00:18:37.936
Is your group working internationally

410
00:18:37.936 --> 00:18:39.814
at this point in time?

411
00:18:39.814 --> 00:18:40.638
<v ->My work...</v>

412
00:18:40.638 --> 00:18:42.705
<v Voiceover>Nationally or more internationally?</v>

413
00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:43.410
<v ->Internationally.</v>

414
00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:44.899
<v Voiceover>Internationally.</v>

415
00:18:45.508 --> 00:18:49.444
Our dyslexia work is a lot more popular in Europe

416
00:18:49.444 --> 00:18:51.453
than it is here in the United States.

417
00:18:51.453 --> 00:18:53.035
<v Voiceover>Why is that?</v>

418
00:18:53.551 --> 00:18:55.986
<v ->They don't have the kind of opposition we have here.</v>

419
00:18:55.986 --> 00:18:59.295
There are four dyslexia societies in America

420
00:18:59.295 --> 00:19:02.850
that don't want dyslexia to go away.

421
00:19:03.901 --> 00:19:06.200
If dyslexia were to disappear,

422
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.317
there would be no reason for them to exist.

423
00:19:09.439 --> 00:19:11.970
So, they really don't want to hear

424
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:14.741
that it is capable of making it go away.

425
00:19:14.741 --> 00:19:15.914
And we're just being persistent.

426
00:19:15.914 --> 00:19:19.176
We're going to keep going the way we're going.

427
00:19:19.176 --> 00:19:22.935
And, well, you take a country like Switzerland,

428
00:19:22.935 --> 00:19:25.257
has a much higher standard of living

429
00:19:25.257 --> 00:19:27.486
than here in the United States,

430
00:19:27.486 --> 00:19:29.959
and there also are some peculiarities there

431
00:19:29.959 --> 00:19:32.258
if you are selling products in Switzerland,

432
00:19:32.258 --> 00:19:34.220
and your product is the second-best product

433
00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.427
that has ever been,

434
00:19:35.427 --> 00:19:37.703
you're not going to sell any of them in Switzerland.

435
00:19:37.703 --> 00:19:40.370
Because, I mean, it's the mentality

436
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.563
of the Rolex watch.

437
00:19:43.563 --> 00:19:46.744
So we see that occurring there.

438
00:19:47.504 --> 00:19:50.975
Switzerland, I live in the San Francisco Bay area,

439
00:19:50.975 --> 00:19:53.306
the entire population of Switzerland

440
00:19:53.306 --> 00:19:58.124
is smaller than the Bay Area population

441
00:19:58.124 --> 00:20:00.585
and I think that there are probably

442
00:20:00.585 --> 00:20:03.697
over 40 facilitators in Switzerland.

443
00:20:03.697 --> 00:20:05.891
There might be as many a 60.

444
00:20:05.891 --> 00:20:08.329
And in the Bay Area, here, we've got,

445
00:20:08.329 --> 00:20:10.144
I think, five.

446
00:20:11.693 --> 00:20:13.562
And the reason for that is,

447
00:20:13.562 --> 00:20:16.871
in addressing learning disabilities,

448
00:20:16.871 --> 00:20:18.705
it didn't take very long for them to

449
00:20:18.705 --> 00:20:22.328
do their own studies and see that

450
00:20:22.328 --> 00:20:24.580
this actually works.

451
00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.264
And as a result of it, it's going in.

452
00:20:28.453 --> 00:20:32.958
This that I'm talking about is the one-on-one

453
00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:34.525
facilitator at work.

454
00:20:34.525 --> 00:20:38.995
This is the mot inefficient method of addressing dyslexia.

455
00:20:38.995 --> 00:20:42.536
It's very effective, but because of this inefficiency,

456
00:20:42.536 --> 00:20:44.919
it's also very expensive.

457
00:20:46.898 --> 00:20:48.408
A question that was asked of me,

458
00:20:48.408 --> 00:20:50.370
something that I had though about an awful lot

459
00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:53.203
before anybody got up the courage to ask,

460
00:20:53.203 --> 00:20:55.780
and that is, would it be possible to

461
00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:59.143
prevent dyslexia from occurring in the first place?

462
00:20:59.143 --> 00:21:01.280
And the answer that I gave that person is,

463
00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.059
probably.

464
00:21:03.982 --> 00:21:07.453
If you take a series of steps and procedures

465
00:21:07.453 --> 00:21:10.054
that a person, an adult person, has to go through

466
00:21:10.054 --> 00:21:12.828
in order to correct their problem.

467
00:21:12.828 --> 00:21:13.824
What would happen if someone

468
00:21:13.824 --> 00:21:16.692
went through all those steps and procedures

469
00:21:16.692 --> 00:21:19.498
before the problem ever even showed up.

470
00:21:19.498 --> 00:21:21.341
<v Voiceover>So you're talking very early childhood?</v>

471
00:21:21.341 --> 00:21:23.663
<v ->Kindergarten to third grade.</v>

472
00:21:23.663 --> 00:21:26.403
And this is called Davis Learning Strategies.

473
00:21:26.403 --> 00:21:31.403
And we're just barely getting it going here in America.

474
00:21:31.542 --> 00:21:33.040
Where there are other places in the world

475
00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.573
where it's going full blast,

476
00:21:34.573 --> 00:21:37.003
like the country of Iceland.

477
00:21:37.447 --> 00:21:40.256
We're already in 20 percent of

478
00:21:40.256 --> 00:21:41.719
the school system in Iceland.

479
00:21:41.719 --> 00:21:44.615
Will be 100 percent of their school system

480
00:21:45.263 --> 00:21:47.240
within five years.

481
00:21:48.058 --> 00:21:52.018
And this is because their purpose of education

482
00:21:52.372 --> 00:21:54.763
is not the same as it is in the United States.

483
00:21:54.763 --> 00:21:58.072
In addition to that, right after the second world war,

484
00:21:58.072 --> 00:22:01.578
a study was done and as a result of the study,

485
00:22:01.578 --> 00:22:04.144
it showed that the Icelandic people

486
00:22:04.144 --> 00:22:06.977
were the most highly educated people in the world.

487
00:22:06.977 --> 00:22:09.075
The most literate and highly educated.

488
00:22:09.075 --> 00:22:12.512
And this remained that way

489
00:22:12.512 --> 00:22:14.888
until 1997.

490
00:22:14.888 --> 00:22:18.720
So from 1947 to 1997, they were the most

491
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:22.992
educated and most literate people in the whole world.

492
00:22:22.992 --> 00:22:24.629
And then another study was done,

493
00:22:24.629 --> 00:22:27.230
and they slipped from number one to number three.

494
00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:28.333
<v Voiceover>Who was number one and two?</v>

495
00:22:28.333 --> 00:22:29.551
<v ->Well, I don't know.</v>

496
00:22:29.551 --> 00:22:31.003
<v Voiceover>Still, they're up there.</v>

497
00:22:31.003 --> 00:22:35.563
<v ->But, for having had all of those years,</v>

498
00:22:35.563 --> 00:22:38.082
almost 50 years of being number one,

499
00:22:38.082 --> 00:22:40.045
to going to number three, that to them

500
00:22:40.045 --> 00:22:41.786
is a major embarrassment.

501
00:22:41.786 --> 00:22:43.423
They will do anything to get it back.

502
00:22:43.423 --> 00:22:46.700
So they're interested in finding stuff that works.

503
00:22:49.709 --> 00:22:52.528
<v Voiceover>One final question here.</v>

504
00:22:52.528 --> 00:22:55.694
Did your parents live long enough

505
00:22:55.694 --> 00:22:59.967
to see the turnaround in you and your life

506
00:22:59.967 --> 00:23:02.138
and your accomplishments?

507
00:23:02.138 --> 00:23:04.262
And that's the first question.

508
00:23:04.262 --> 00:23:05.536
I guess there's more than one left

509
00:23:05.536 --> 00:23:07.005
then isn't there?

510
00:23:07.005 --> 00:23:10.817
<v ->Well, I have to say, to some degree yes.</v>

511
00:23:10.817 --> 00:23:13.314
I don't know how interested my father was

512
00:23:13.314 --> 00:23:16.855
in where things were going to go.

513
00:23:16.855 --> 00:23:19.316
My father and I didn't have a very good relationship

514
00:23:19.316 --> 00:23:23.406
as an infant or as a child.

515
00:23:25.583 --> 00:23:27.644
He couldn't relate to me.

516
00:23:28.195 --> 00:23:32.181
His only ability was on a physical level,

517
00:23:32.604 --> 00:23:35.805
which means that there were a lot of beatings that happened,

518
00:23:35.805 --> 00:23:38.069
and there's evidence of 36 broken bones

519
00:23:38.069 --> 00:23:42.127
that I got between the ages of three and 13.

520
00:23:42.377 --> 00:23:47.148
Later, I endured a great deal of therapy

521
00:23:47.148 --> 00:23:50.231
trying to find the ability to forgive him.

522
00:23:50.515 --> 00:23:53.360
One of the commandments of the religious belief

523
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.844
that I hold very dear is that I am

524
00:23:55.844 --> 00:23:57.922
to honor my mother and father,

525
00:23:57.922 --> 00:24:00.253
and how do you honor some raging beast

526
00:24:00.253 --> 00:24:03.146
that broke your bones?

527
00:24:03.767 --> 00:24:08.767
I eventually, not in therapy, eventually I found

528
00:24:09.333 --> 00:24:11.504
the ability first to forgive myself

529
00:24:11.504 --> 00:24:13.861
and to forgive him and everybody else.

530
00:24:13.861 --> 00:24:15.266
And then I wanted to meet the man

531
00:24:15.266 --> 00:24:16.741
that everyone else knew.

532
00:24:16.741 --> 00:24:18.749
See, the only people that didn't like my father

533
00:24:18.749 --> 00:24:20.212
were me and my mother.

534
00:24:20.212 --> 00:24:21.953
I mean, he was a wonderful man.

535
00:24:21.953 --> 00:24:23.103
He was a community leader,

536
00:24:23.103 --> 00:24:25.785
he was this fantastic human being

537
00:24:25.785 --> 00:24:28.060
until he came home and closed the door

538
00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.839
and he became this raging monster.

539
00:24:31.053 --> 00:24:32.214
Well, I wanted to meet the man

540
00:24:32.214 --> 00:24:34.188
that everybody else knew and loved.

541
00:24:34.188 --> 00:24:35.465
And every time I would get close,

542
00:24:35.465 --> 00:24:36.231
he would run away.

543
00:24:36.231 --> 00:24:38.890
He wouldn't let me meet him.

544
00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:42.036
So I don't know what kind of feelings

545
00:24:42.036 --> 00:24:43.069
he would have had.

546
00:24:43.069 --> 00:24:45.426
I never had a conversation with him.

547
00:24:48.374 --> 00:24:49.846
I never...

548
00:24:49.846 --> 00:24:52.330
I don't know if I ever called him daddy.

549
00:24:53.914 --> 00:24:58.914
It was my karma to be who I was in that role

550
00:24:59.116 --> 00:25:02.758
and it's his karma to be on the other side of that.

551
00:25:02.758 --> 00:25:05.263
And I think both of us filled whatever

552
00:25:05.263 --> 00:25:08.395
our karmic requirements were very well.

553
00:25:08.395 --> 00:25:11.638
<v Voiceover>Painful as it was, it was a gift.</v>

554
00:25:11.638 --> 00:25:15.833
<v ->And I found my own ability to forgive the two of us.</v>

555
00:25:15.833 --> 00:25:18.480
Yet, he went to his grave with the inability

556
00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.988
to even look for it.

557
00:25:21.748 --> 00:25:25.405
From that perspective, I don't know what that was.

558
00:25:27.082 --> 00:25:30.333
In addition to that, my father would have seen

559
00:25:33.717 --> 00:25:36.759
the time of being successful financially

560
00:25:36.759 --> 00:25:40.427
as being more important than

561
00:25:40.427 --> 00:25:43.434
my being successful on a different level

562
00:25:43.434 --> 00:25:48.085
that has very little do with finances.

563
00:25:49.701 --> 00:25:51.036
<v Voiceover>What about your mother?</v>

564
00:25:51.036 --> 00:25:52.893
<v ->My mother was quite different.</v>

565
00:25:52.893 --> 00:25:54.577
We had our center open and operating

566
00:25:54.577 --> 00:25:57.212
for about four years upstairs

567
00:25:57.212 --> 00:25:59.778
and a parent asked me what my mother

568
00:25:59.778 --> 00:26:02.251
though about all this, and I said, I don't know.

569
00:26:02.251 --> 00:26:04.352
I haven't even told her I'm doing it.

570
00:26:04.352 --> 00:26:06.593
And Dr. Ali overheard me saying that

571
00:26:06.593 --> 00:26:08.056
and she came out and she says,

572
00:26:08.056 --> 00:26:10.027
"You haven't told your mother?

573
00:26:10.027 --> 00:26:12.059
"Go in right now, you call her right this minute

574
00:26:12.059 --> 00:26:13.289
"and you tell her."

575
00:26:13.289 --> 00:26:15.426
And I said, well I know exactly what she's going to say.

576
00:26:15.426 --> 00:26:17.829
And Fatima said, it doesn't matter what she says.

577
00:26:17.829 --> 00:26:19.292
You have to go in there, you have to call her,

578
00:26:19.292 --> 00:26:20.929
you have to tell her.

579
00:26:20.929 --> 00:26:23.367
So, I did what I was told, I went in and I called her

580
00:26:23.367 --> 00:26:25.410
and I told her and she said

581
00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:28.278
exactly, word-for-word what I thought she was gonna say.

582
00:26:28.278 --> 00:26:28.975
<v Voiceover>Which was?</v>

583
00:26:28.975 --> 00:26:30.437
<v ->"Oh Ronny, what do you want to have</v>

584
00:26:30.437 --> 00:26:33.053
"anything to do with people like that for?"

585
00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.172
<v Voiceover>Wow.</v>

586
00:26:35.172 --> 00:26:37.552
<v ->I said, mom, because I am a people like that.</v>

587
00:26:37.552 --> 00:26:40.132
And he says, "Oh no Ronny, you're perfect."

588
00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.119
And that was her denial.

589
00:26:43.119 --> 00:26:45.379
I mean, that was her denial all along.

590
00:26:45.379 --> 00:26:47.258
<v Voiceover>And there are millions of people</v>

591
00:26:47.258 --> 00:26:49.765
who are parenting that are living in that denial.

592
00:26:49.765 --> 00:26:52.971
<v ->For me, my mother was an angel.</v>

593
00:26:52.971 --> 00:26:56.952
I mean, for my brother, she was a typical mother.

594
00:26:58.768 --> 00:27:00.579
She had expectations for him.

595
00:27:00.579 --> 00:27:04.373
My mother had absolutely no expectations for me at all.

596
00:27:04.373 --> 00:27:07.647
She didn't put any requirements

597
00:27:07.647 --> 00:27:10.352
or restrictions or anything in my way

598
00:27:10.352 --> 00:27:13.417
and every little bit that I got was, for her,

599
00:27:13.417 --> 00:27:15.888
just wonderful.

600
00:27:15.888 --> 00:27:17.223
I say she was an angel.

601
00:27:17.223 --> 00:27:20.174
There were a couple of things that she did that...

602
00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:25.602
My older brother would spend days working on me

603
00:27:25.602 --> 00:27:27.947
to get me to make a sound.

604
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.377
And then, I would make that sound in front of my mother

605
00:27:31.377 --> 00:27:33.293
and she'd wash my mouth out with soap.

606
00:27:33.293 --> 00:27:35.139
And I never understood it, but it has

607
00:27:35.139 --> 00:27:36.947
made me dislike cilantro.

608
00:27:36.947 --> 00:27:38.050
(chuckling)

609
00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:38.747
<v Voiceover>You and me both.</v>

610
00:27:38.747 --> 00:27:40.012
It tastes like soap.

611
00:27:40.012 --> 00:27:42.075
<v ->Tastes just like soap.</v>

612
00:27:42.075 --> 00:27:43.939
So uh...

613
00:27:46.058 --> 00:27:51.058
But for me, because of the characteritics

614
00:27:51.421 --> 00:27:53.894
that I had earlier of being right in people's faces

615
00:27:53.894 --> 00:27:57.470
and staring, I knew all of,

616
00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:59.096
everybody's facial features.

617
00:27:59.096 --> 00:28:00.291
You know, I knew the colors of their eyes.

618
00:28:00.291 --> 00:28:03.101
But I couldn't ever remember

619
00:28:03.101 --> 00:28:05.159
the color of my mother's eyes.

620
00:28:05.443 --> 00:28:06.732
When I would see images,

621
00:28:06.732 --> 00:28:09.147
when I would remember her face,

622
00:28:09.147 --> 00:28:12.746
I would just see the sparkle and the glow,

623
00:28:12.746 --> 00:28:15.509
but I couldn't see the color until the day she died.

624
00:28:15.509 --> 00:28:17.921
The day he died and that sparkle, that glow was gone,

625
00:28:17.921 --> 00:28:19.215
then I could see what color her eyes were.

626
00:28:19.215 --> 00:28:21.119
But it's amazing.

627
00:28:21.119 --> 00:28:23.696
I don't know if it was psychological on my part

628
00:28:23.696 --> 00:28:25.763
or if it was reality.

629
00:28:25.763 --> 00:28:27.029
<v Voiceover>Maybe it was an expanded awareness</v>

630
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:28.526
where just were seeing the essence

631
00:28:28.526 --> 00:28:30.361
of who she is.

632
00:28:30.361 --> 00:28:33.240
<v ->She was a pretty wonderful woman for me.</v>

633
00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:37.106
So many people would have been willing

634
00:28:37.106 --> 00:28:40.136
to have me taken away, especially

635
00:28:40.136 --> 00:28:42.447
right around the ages of seven and eight,

636
00:28:42.447 --> 00:28:45.813
it was especially bad because I was a biter.

637
00:28:45.813 --> 00:28:50.481
And around the age of eight is when

638
00:28:50.481 --> 00:28:51.920
you can bite good enough that you can

639
00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.952
bite pieces off.

640
00:28:53.952 --> 00:28:58.097
So, that was a a rather hard time I think for her.

641
00:28:58.097 --> 00:28:59.525
That and the very beginning.

642
00:28:59.525 --> 00:29:02.427
I was born at the beginning of the second world war,

643
00:29:02.427 --> 00:29:05.771
and she couldn't hold me or cuddle me

644
00:29:05.771 --> 00:29:07.930
and she tried to breastfeed me

645
00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:09.742
and I would just scream.

646
00:29:09.742 --> 00:29:13.213
They figured out a way to lay me on a pillow

647
00:29:13.213 --> 00:29:15.013
and then she would lay next to me

648
00:29:15.013 --> 00:29:16.383
and not touch me and I would eat.

649
00:29:16.383 --> 00:29:18.577
She said that only lasted for a couple of weeks

650
00:29:18.577 --> 00:29:20.411
and then I was screaming again.

651
00:29:20.411 --> 00:29:24.080
But my mom on a ranch in Texas,

652
00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.926
out in the middle of nowhere, so she didn't really

653
00:29:25.926 --> 00:29:27.888
have an education.

654
00:29:27.888 --> 00:29:32.822
And she knew how to care for orphan lambs and cows,

655
00:29:32.822 --> 00:29:37.130
and we couldn't get the rubber nipples for the bottles,

656
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:41.561
so she made nipples out of leather finger gloves.

657
00:29:42.432 --> 00:29:44.232
The finger from a leather glove.

658
00:29:44.232 --> 00:29:46.542
And to this day, I like the taste of wet leather.

659
00:29:46.542 --> 00:29:49.097
(chuckling)

660
00:29:50.018 --> 00:29:51.332
<v Voiceover>What an absolutely...</v>

661
00:29:51.332 --> 00:29:53.352
It sounds like she was, even though in denial,

662
00:29:53.352 --> 00:29:56.278
an amazing woman, and what an amazing

663
00:29:56.278 --> 00:29:57.999
life you've led.

664
00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.719
I'm most anxious to see how your life

665
00:30:01.719 --> 00:30:03.588
is going to impact all of these

666
00:30:03.588 --> 00:30:06.491
brilliant little ones that are coming down the pike now.

667
00:30:06.491 --> 00:30:07.362
<v ->Thank you very much.</v>

668
00:30:07.362 --> 00:30:10.563
I look forward to it too.

669
00:30:11.413 --> 00:30:15.573
I have the good fortune of having seen a little bit of it.

670
00:30:16.333 --> 00:30:17.949
And I know that

671
00:30:20.072 --> 00:30:23.129
it is my purpose for being alive.

672
00:30:23.645 --> 00:30:25.085
And I have to do this otherwise

673
00:30:25.085 --> 00:30:27.020
there's no justification for breathing.

674
00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.171
So, I will do it.

675
00:30:29.951 --> 00:30:30.485
<v Voiceover>Thank you.</v>

676
00:30:30.485 --> 00:30:31.769
<v ->Thank you.</v>

677
00:30:34.386 --> 00:30:35.954
<v ->To learn more about Ron Davis'</v>
