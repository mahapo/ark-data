00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:04.998
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:15.853 line:15% 
<v ->Burt Goldman considers himself a lucky man.</v>

3
00:00:15.853 --> 00:00:18.701 line:15% 
Unlike many, he recognized his path early in life

4
00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:20.237 line:15% 
after an encounter with a mystic

5
00:00:20.237 --> 00:00:22.509 line:15% 
while serving with the military in Korea.

6
00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.834 line:15% 
This meeting led to a lifelong commitment

7
00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:28.183 line:15% 
of understanding the essence of conscious intentions

8
00:00:28.183 --> 00:00:30.594 line:15% 
as he studied with Yogananda as a young man,

9
00:00:30.594 --> 00:00:32.748 line:15% 
became the top Silva Method instructor

10
00:00:32.748 --> 00:00:34.476 line:15% 
and later, struck out on his own

11
00:00:34.476 --> 00:00:36.332 line:15% 
to share his secrets of life.

12
00:00:36.332 --> 00:00:38.497 line:15% 
His method, called quantum jumping,

13
00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:41.494 line:15% 
is designed for manifesting our greatest potentials;

14
00:00:41.494 --> 00:00:43.942 line:15% 
his life is living proof of it.

15
00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:49.008 line:15% 
(upbeat music)

16
00:00:53.632 --> 00:00:55.403 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>We are in your home,</v>

17
00:00:55.403 --> 00:00:58.208 line:15% 
surrounded by all this absolutely beautiful artwork;

18
00:00:58.208 --> 00:01:02.080 line:15% 
this fresh, alive, colorful, spontaneous artwork

19
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.013 line:15% 
that you started creating at the age of 80,

20
00:01:05.013 --> 00:01:06.911 line:15% 
or 78, right, on your painting?

21
00:01:06.911 --> 00:01:08.321 line:15% 
<v ->I was 78 when I painted,</v>

22
00:01:08.321 --> 00:01:10.325 line:15% 
the first time I picked up a paintbrush.

23
00:01:10.325 --> 00:01:12.831 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>78, and then you started doing photography,</v>

24
00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:13.930 line:15% 
which actually, these--

25
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.156 line:15% 
<v ->No, photography came first.</v>

26
00:01:15.156 --> 00:01:16.340 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Oh, photography came first?</v>

27
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.263 line:15% 
You do an amazing job of both.

28
00:01:19.263 --> 00:01:21.289 line:15% 
I mean, this is really quite fascinating,

29
00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.401 line:15% 
and you ended up in museums even.

30
00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:26.654 line:15% 
Even though you say you had no ability

31
00:01:26.654 --> 00:01:28.468 line:15% 
in either one up to this point in your life.

32
00:01:28.468 --> 00:01:29.492 line:15% 
<v Burt>None.</v>

33
00:01:29.492 --> 00:01:31.177 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Zippo.</v>
<v Burt>Zippo.</v>

34
00:01:31.177 --> 00:01:32.435 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>And the reason we're talking to you is,</v>

35
00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:34.526 line:15% 
we're going to find out what you tapped into

36
00:01:34.526 --> 00:01:36.595 line:15% 
to allow this expression to come forward,

37
00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:38.078 line:15% 
but first, I'd like to go backward.

38
00:01:38.078 --> 00:01:41.189 line:15% 
I'd like to go back to your past and the days of,

39
00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.091 line:15% 
well, you were in the military in Korea,

40
00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:45.021 line:15% 
so this must have been during the Korean War, I assume?

41
00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:46.877 line:15% 
<v ->No, no, actually, when I was in Korea,</v>

42
00:01:46.877 --> 00:01:48.346 line:15% 
no one ever heard the name.

43
00:01:48.346 --> 00:01:49.988 line:15% 
I had no idea where Korea was,

44
00:01:49.988 --> 00:01:53.316 line:15% 
and neither did any of the 10,000 other GIs who were

45
00:01:53.316 --> 00:01:54.669 line:15% 
on the boat with me.

46
00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:55.908 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Really?</v>

47
00:01:55.908 --> 00:01:59.183 line:15% 
<v ->We had no idea where Korea, this was in 1946.</v>

48
00:01:59.183 --> 00:02:00.932 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Oh, okay, so it was a few years prior.</v>

49
00:02:00.932 --> 00:02:02.457 line:15% 
<v ->Long before the Korean War.</v>

50
00:02:02.457 --> 00:02:04.707 line:15% 
<v Burt>Not that long--</v>
<v Voiceover>A few years.</v>

51
00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:06.062 line:15% 
<v ->But before.</v>

52
00:02:06.062 --> 00:02:09.974 line:15% 
And Korea had, we had just liberated Korea.

53
00:02:09.974 --> 00:02:12.641 line:15% 
Actually, I was one of those guys who were waiting

54
00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:15.655 line:15% 
for the invasion of Japan,

55
00:02:15.655 --> 00:02:18.346 line:15% 
which, thankfully we didn't do.

56
00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:21.414 line:15% 
Because if we had, chances are, I wouldn't be

57
00:02:21.414 --> 00:02:23.644 line:15% 
here right now talking to you.

58
00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:28.219 line:15% 
The war ended, and then I shipped to Korea,

59
00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:31.942 line:15% 
and I spent some time there,

60
00:02:31.942 --> 00:02:34.726 line:15% 
and a very good friend of mine happened to be Korean;

61
00:02:34.726 --> 00:02:36.492 line:15% 
American, an American GI.

62
00:02:36.492 --> 00:02:37.495 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>An American Korean over there,</v>

63
00:02:37.495 --> 00:02:39.767 line:15% 
a GI over there with you in Korea, okay.

64
00:02:41.457 --> 00:02:45.153 line:15% 
<v ->That's when I was in Korea, but that was in 1946.</v>

65
00:02:45.153 --> 00:02:46.060 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>'46, okay.</v>

66
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.588 line:15% 
So, you're there, and something happened, though.

67
00:02:48.588 --> 00:02:50.278 line:15% 
You didn't necessarily have the journey

68
00:02:50.278 --> 00:02:51.606 line:15% 
you thought you were taking.

69
00:02:51.606 --> 00:02:53.633 line:15% 
A different journey began in Korea for you.

70
00:02:53.633 --> 00:02:55.435 line:15% 
<v ->Well, the journey began,</v>

71
00:02:55.435 --> 00:02:57.302 line:15% 
now at the time, I was like 19,

72
00:02:57.302 --> 00:03:01.782 line:15% 
and like most 19 year olds, especially in a foreign place,

73
00:03:03.852 --> 00:03:07.563 line:15% 
excited about everything, but not knowing anything,

74
00:03:07.563 --> 00:03:08.858 line:15% 
totally ignorant.

75
00:03:10.128 --> 00:03:13.213 line:15% 
My friend, his name was Kim,

76
00:03:13.213 --> 00:03:17.191 line:15% 
and that's how I addressed him,

77
00:03:17.191 --> 00:03:20.946 line:15% 
and Kim and I would travel through the town.

78
00:03:20.946 --> 00:03:23.644 line:15% 
We were at a place called, well,

79
00:03:23.644 --> 00:03:25.852 line:15% 
we were right on the 38th parallel.

80
00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:28.124 line:15% 
Yung Dung Po, I think comes to name,

81
00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:30.769 line:15% 
but that might have been the place where we landed,

82
00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.574 line:15% 
I'm not sure, but we were just outside of Seoul,

83
00:03:33.574 --> 00:03:35.206 line:15% 
and most of the streets were dirt,

84
00:03:35.206 --> 00:03:39.526 line:15% 
and we were in an old school that the Japanese

85
00:03:39.526 --> 00:03:43.195 line:15% 
had used as barracks; before that it was a Korean school.

86
00:03:43.195 --> 00:03:45.979 line:15% 
That's where I was stationed, and we used to take walks

87
00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:50.501 line:15% 
through the town, and everything was unique, and it was new.

88
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:53.339 line:15% 
For somebody who had never left the United States,

89
00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:57.445 line:15% 
never left, I was born in Brooklyn, but then went to L.A.,

90
00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:00.165 line:15% 
and never left L.A. after that.

91
00:04:00.165 --> 00:04:02.117 line:15% 
It was something.

92
00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:05.316 line:15% 
Well, we wound up in this particular party's home

93
00:04:06.066 --> 00:04:10.771 line:15% 
that my friend Kim had met,

94
00:04:11.343 --> 00:04:14.063 line:15% 
and their name was also Kim.

95
00:04:14.063 --> 00:04:17.422 line:15% 
That's not unusual, Kim is a very common name in Korea.

96
00:04:17.422 --> 00:04:19.909 line:15% 
He would sit and talk to them,

97
00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:21.552 line:15% 
and I would just look around the house,

98
00:04:23.092 --> 00:04:25.765 line:15% 
not touching anything, but they had an organ there.

99
00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:28.634 line:15% 
One day, when he was talking to them,

100
00:04:28.634 --> 00:04:30.437 line:15% 
I was wandering around the backyard,

101
00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:32.133 line:15% 
and finally, I walked in, I got bored,

102
00:04:32.133 --> 00:04:35.343 line:15% 
and I sat down at the organ and I picked out

103
00:04:35.343 --> 00:04:39.678 line:15% 
Auld Lang Syne, one of the only tunes that I knew.

104
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.366 line:15% 
(hums "Auld Lang Syne") That one.

105
00:04:44.366 --> 00:04:48.431 line:15% 
Well, the two Kims jumped up

106
00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:50.893 line:15% 
and were grinning at me,

107
00:04:50.893 --> 00:04:53.976 line:15% 
and my friend Kim was looking at them and looking at me,

108
00:04:53.976 --> 00:04:55.650 line:15% 
and I'm looking at him, "What's going on?"

109
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.783 line:15% 
Well, it turned out that at the time,

110
00:04:57.783 --> 00:05:02.263 line:15% 
Auld Lang Syne, the tune was, not the words of course,

111
00:05:02.263 --> 00:05:05.794 line:15% 
but the tune was the national anthem of Korea.

112
00:05:05.794 --> 00:05:07.767 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>What are the odds of that?</v>

113
00:05:07.767 --> 00:05:11.969 line:15% 
<v ->A jillion to one, that was the only song I knew.</v>

114
00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:15.436 line:15% 
And then we became great friends.

115
00:05:15.436 --> 00:05:18.337 line:15% 
All of a sudden, I was part of the family, too.

116
00:05:18.337 --> 00:05:22.880 line:15% 
We used to go there, whenever we had time off,

117
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.880 line:15% 
we'd run over to the Kims', and one day I was there,

118
00:05:27.883 --> 00:05:32.384 line:15% 
and I had a headache, and I told my friend Kim,

119
00:05:32.384 --> 00:05:34.517 line:15% 
I said, "Let's go."

120
00:05:34.517 --> 00:05:35.744 line:15% 
He said, "What's the problem?"

121
00:05:35.744 --> 00:05:38.442 line:15% 
I said, "I've got a terrible headache."

122
00:05:38.442 --> 00:05:42.527 line:15% 
So he tells mystic Kim, we'll call him mystic Kim

123
00:05:42.527 --> 00:05:44.895 line:15% 
so you can tell, and my friend Kim.

124
00:05:44.895 --> 00:05:47.455 line:15% 
He tells mystic Kim that I've got a headache,

125
00:05:47.455 --> 00:05:50.527 line:15% 
so mystic Kim says something and he walks over to me,

126
00:05:50.527 --> 00:05:53.684 line:15% 
and he does something like this around my head.

127
00:05:53.684 --> 00:05:56.329 line:15% 
And almost magically, the headache disappeared.

128
00:05:56.329 --> 00:05:59.049 line:15% 
I said, "What did he do?"

129
00:05:59.049 --> 00:06:01.950 line:15% 
And he started explaining.

130
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.289 line:15% 
I said, "What is that, tell me more about that."

131
00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.491 line:15% 
After that, our conversations all became metaphysical,

132
00:06:09.491 --> 00:06:12.093 line:15% 
through the translation of my friend.

133
00:06:12.093 --> 00:06:13.949 line:15% 
I got kind of interested, and,

134
00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:17.473 line:15% 
long story, I don't want to,

135
00:06:17.473 --> 00:06:20.209 line:15% 
this story could take all day, so,

136
00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:23.794 line:15% 
the next thing I knew, I was in Hawaii,

137
00:06:23.794 --> 00:06:25.725 line:15% 
I was sent to Hawaii.

138
00:06:26.971 --> 00:06:31.251 line:15% 
In Hawaii, now this is in 1946.

139
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:33.145 line:15% 
Hawaii was different.

140
00:06:33.145 --> 00:06:35.203 line:15% 
I was stationed at Schofield Barracks,

141
00:06:35.203 --> 00:06:37.209 line:15% 
which is still there, by the way,

142
00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:41.038 line:15% 
and we used to take nice long walks in the pineapple fields,

143
00:06:41.038 --> 00:06:43.448 line:15% 
and one day, I met somebody who was called a Huna,

144
00:06:43.448 --> 00:06:45.027 line:15% 
I didn't know what a Huna was.

145
00:06:46.917 --> 00:06:50.305 line:15% 
The conversation was similar to the ones

146
00:06:50.305 --> 00:06:53.537 line:15% 
that I had with mystic Kim, through a translator,

147
00:06:53.537 --> 00:06:56.841 line:15% 
and I got a little bit more interested in it.

148
00:06:56.841 --> 00:06:59.860 line:15% 
That was, kind of started me on the journey.

149
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.358 line:15% 
It was a seed that was planted, but it was just there.

150
00:07:03.358 --> 00:07:05.502 line:15% 
I paid no attention to it.

151
00:07:05.502 --> 00:07:09.294 line:15% 
Ultimately, got out of the army,

152
00:07:09.294 --> 00:07:11.854 line:15% 
and went back, was discharged,

153
00:07:11.854 --> 00:07:15.918 line:15% 
went back to Los Angeles, and a friend of mine,

154
00:07:15.918 --> 00:07:20.219 line:15% 
Ben Denoff, who at the time was a concert violinist,

155
00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:22.406 line:15% 
he was a child prodigy, actually,

156
00:07:22.406 --> 00:07:24.742 line:15% 
but when I knew him, he wasn't a prodigy anymore,

157
00:07:24.742 --> 00:07:28.208 line:15% 
he kind of lost it, but he was a concert violinist,

158
00:07:28.208 --> 00:07:30.437 line:15% 
and he was playing for the studios,

159
00:07:30.437 --> 00:07:32.613 line:15% 
and he was involved with meditation.

160
00:07:32.613 --> 00:07:33.872 line:15% 
I didn't know what meditation was,

161
00:07:33.872 --> 00:07:35.770 line:15% 
I mean, I'd heard about it, but I really didn't

162
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.074 line:15% 
know too much about it.

163
00:07:38.074 --> 00:07:40.655 line:15% 
He said, "I'd like you to meet my guru."

164
00:07:40.655 --> 00:07:43.642 line:15% 
I said, "Your guru, you've got a guru?"

165
00:07:43.642 --> 00:07:46.411 line:15% 
He said, "Yeah, you ever hear of Paramahansa Yogananda?"

166
00:07:46.411 --> 00:07:47.904 line:15% 
I said, "No."

167
00:07:47.904 --> 00:07:50.176 line:15% 
He said, "Well, you gotta come."

168
00:07:50.176 --> 00:07:51.936 line:15% 
I said, "Where is it?"

169
00:07:51.936 --> 00:07:54.144 line:15% 
He says, "Eagle Rock."

170
00:07:54.144 --> 00:07:56.213 line:15% 
I didn't even know where Eagle Rock was;

171
00:07:56.213 --> 00:07:59.743 line:15% 
it's by Washington, okay, let's go.

172
00:07:59.743 --> 00:08:02.571 line:15% 
And I met Paramahansa Yogananda,

173
00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:04.842 line:15% 
and was very, very impressed.

174
00:08:04.842 --> 00:08:09.493 line:15% 
I thought, "Well, let me look into this.

175
00:08:09.493 --> 00:08:13.877 line:15% 
"It goes along with what I learned in Korea and Hawaii."

176
00:08:13.877 --> 00:08:17.108 line:15% 
I learned how to meditate, and I took to it.

177
00:08:17.108 --> 00:08:18.986 line:15% 
I enjoyed meditation,

178
00:08:18.986 --> 00:08:23.092 line:15% 
and I was totally taken by Paramahansa Yogananda,

179
00:08:23.092 --> 00:08:25.994 line:15% 
I mean, to be in his presence was like being

180
00:08:25.994 --> 00:08:30.617 line:15% 
in the presence of a, of a super human being.

181
00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:33.844 line:15% 
I never felt that way in the presence of any other person

182
00:08:33.844 --> 00:08:37.443 line:15% 
I'd ever met in my life, before or since.

183
00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:41.300 line:15% 
I was kind of,

184
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.383 line:15% 
you might say an apprentice monk at the time.

185
00:08:44.383 --> 00:08:48.724 line:15% 
I was going to become, join the,

186
00:08:48.724 --> 00:08:50.420 line:15% 
I was already in the organization,

187
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.169
the Self-Realization Organization,

188
00:08:52.169 --> 00:08:56.233 line:15% 
and I was going to join it, and become,

189
00:08:56.233 --> 00:09:00.873 line:15% 
dedicate my life to meditation and,

190
00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:04.307 line:15% 
as some of my friends in the organization were doing.

191
00:09:04.307 --> 00:09:07.517 line:15% 
One of my friends would meditate two hours a day.

192
00:09:07.517 --> 00:09:09.256 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>And now, mind you,</v>

193
00:09:09.256 --> 00:09:11.229 line:15% 
you're still only, what, 19, 20, 21?

194
00:09:11.229 --> 00:09:13.064 line:15% 
<v ->At this time, I was about 21.</v>

195
00:09:13.064 --> 00:09:14.525 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>21, okay.</v>
<v Burt>21.</v>

196
00:09:14.525 --> 00:09:16.573 line:15% 
And I'd just gotten married.

197
00:09:18.283 --> 00:09:22.153 line:15% 
Then my wife became pregnant, and now I'm concerned.

198
00:09:24.508 --> 00:09:25.671 line:15% 
Do I want a family?

199
00:09:25.671 --> 00:09:27.346 line:15% 
Well, I've already got a family, I've got a wife--

200
00:09:27.346 --> 00:09:28.455 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>You've got one on the way.</v>

201
00:09:28.455 --> 00:09:33.455 line:15% 
<v ->And one on the way, so Yogananda had a big meeting</v>

202
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.977 line:15% 
with about 100 of us at Mt. Washington.

203
00:09:38.587 --> 00:09:42.549 line:15% 
My wife and Ben's wife were friends,

204
00:09:42.549 --> 00:09:46.538 line:15% 
and they stayed together, and Ben and I went

205
00:09:46.538 --> 00:09:51.538 line:15% 
to Mt. Washington to sit at the feet of the master.

206
00:09:52.628 --> 00:09:55.060 line:15% 
We get there at eight o'clock.

207
00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:59.124 line:15% 
Swamis, they don't know too much from time.

208
00:09:59.124 --> 00:10:00.681 line:15% 
They don't really care about time.

209
00:10:00.681 --> 00:10:01.587 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Well, they spend a lot of time</v>

210
00:10:01.587 --> 00:10:03.582 line:15% 
in the other dimensions in meditation.

211
00:10:03.582 --> 00:10:04.414 line:15% 
(laughter)

212
00:10:04.414 --> 00:10:05.577 line:15% 
<v ->Really.</v>

213
00:10:05.577 --> 00:10:08.414 line:15% 
So, we're there eight o'clock, nine o'clock,

214
00:10:08.414 --> 00:10:11.592 line:15% 
ten o'clock, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock!

215
00:10:11.592 --> 00:10:13.981 line:15% 
Pretty soon, it's two o'clock in the morning.

216
00:10:13.981 --> 00:10:15.657 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Oh, he was really tardy!</v>

217
00:10:16.607 --> 00:10:18.787
(claps hands together)

218
00:10:18.787 --> 00:10:22.434 line:15% 
<v ->The master walks in, Yogananda-gi walks in.</v>

219
00:10:22.434 --> 00:10:25.762 line:15% 
Nobody left; there were over 100 people there,

220
00:10:25.762 --> 00:10:28.269 line:15% 
not one person left, two o'clock in the morning.

221
00:10:28.269 --> 00:10:30.839 line:15% 
We were all anointed,

222
00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:33.559 line:15% 
and I spoke with him personally for a bit,

223
00:10:33.559 --> 00:10:38.559 line:15% 
and he kind of anointed me with sandalwood.

224
00:10:39.809 --> 00:10:42.945 line:15% 
I go back home, and it's now four o'clock in the morning,

225
00:10:42.945 --> 00:10:46.379 line:15% 
and my wife, I don't have to tell you how she feels now:

226
00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:48.907 line:15% 
"You got to make a choice here."

227
00:10:48.907 --> 00:10:52.022 line:15% 
I thought, "Yeah, I really do have to make a choice.

228
00:10:52.022 --> 00:10:53.878 line:15% 
"Something's got to happen.

229
00:10:53.878 --> 00:10:57.547 line:15% 
"Do I want to leave my family and become a monk?

230
00:10:57.547 --> 00:11:01.002 line:15% 
"I can't leave my family, I'm just having a baby!"

231
00:11:01.002 --> 00:11:05.536 line:15% 
So I left the organization, but I was still involved.

232
00:11:07.916 --> 00:11:12.458 line:15% 
Then, this was in the early '50s, late '40s, early '50s,

233
00:11:13.338 --> 00:11:18.068 line:15% 
and then Yogananda left this world in a spectacular way,

234
00:11:20.348 --> 00:11:22.793 line:15% 
that you can probably read about, I won't go into that--

235
00:11:22.793 --> 00:11:23.945 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Google it.</v>

236
00:11:23.945 --> 00:11:26.782 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah, you can Google the end, his demise,</v>

237
00:11:26.782 --> 00:11:27.945 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>The Yogananda's death, yes.</v>

238
00:11:27.945 --> 00:11:29.450 line:15% 
<v ->It's worth Googling, actually.</v>

239
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:33.122 line:15% 
But I kept the meditation part of it.

240
00:11:33.122 --> 00:11:35.234 line:15% 
I knew about meditation, you know.

241
00:11:35.234 --> 00:11:37.548 line:15% 
I had been meditating the whole time I was there.

242
00:11:37.548 --> 00:11:39.735 line:15% 
And I still visited the Lake Shrine,

243
00:11:39.735 --> 00:11:44.631 line:15% 
which is in the Pacific Palisades section of Los Angeles,

244
00:11:44.631 --> 00:11:46.657 line:15% 
which is to this day,

245
00:11:46.657 --> 00:11:48.630 line:15% 
the calmest place I know of on the planet.

246
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.676 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>I've never been,</v>

247
00:11:49.676 --> 00:11:51.446 line:15% 
and I've heard so many people talk about it.

248
00:11:51.446 --> 00:11:52.854 line:15% 
I've got to go there.

249
00:11:52.854 --> 00:11:55.873 line:15% 
<v ->If you get back towards Los Angeles, you should stop.</v>

250
00:11:55.873 --> 00:11:57.110 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>What is the name of the shrine?</v>

251
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:58.571 line:15% 
<v ->The Lake Shrine.</v>

252
00:11:58.571 --> 00:11:59.712 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Lake Shrine, okay.</v>

253
00:11:59.712 --> 00:12:04.192 line:15% 
<v ->It's off Sunset Blvd, just before you get to Malibu.</v>

254
00:12:04.192 --> 00:12:05.792 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

255
00:12:05.792 --> 00:12:07.584 line:15% 
<v ->In Pacific, everybody there would</v>

256
00:12:07.584 --> 00:12:09.162 line:15% 
be able to direct you.

257
00:12:09.162 --> 00:12:13.418 line:15% 
Some of Gandhi's ashes are there, as well,

258
00:12:13.418 --> 00:12:15.135 line:15% 
not that you're going to visit Gandhi's ashes,

259
00:12:15.135 --> 00:12:16.917 line:15% 
but they're there.

260
00:12:16.917 --> 00:12:20.127 line:15% 
At any rate, I started meditating after that,

261
00:12:20.127 --> 00:12:23.743 line:15% 
and then I started teaching.

262
00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.929 line:15% 
Ben and I started something.

263
00:12:25.929 --> 00:12:29.139 line:15% 
We had both left the organization

264
00:12:29.139 --> 00:12:31.720 line:15% 
after Yogananda had died,

265
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.549 line:15% 
had left, whatever, and we started some,

266
00:12:35.549 --> 00:12:40.306 line:15% 
Ben had a terrible case of stage fright,

267
00:12:40.306 --> 00:12:43.815 line:15% 
and he wanted to know if I knew anything about

268
00:12:43.815 --> 00:12:45.884 line:15% 
how to get rid of it, and I said,

269
00:12:45.884 --> 00:12:47.719 line:15% 
"Yeah, you know, I've learned a couple of things."

270
00:12:47.719 --> 00:12:50.259 line:15% 
I'd been involved with hypnosis by then.

271
00:12:50.989 --> 00:12:54.855 line:15% 
So I showed him a few things to do,

272
00:12:54.855 --> 00:12:59.548 line:15% 
and he said, "I know a lot of people.

273
00:12:59.548 --> 00:13:01.222 line:15% 
"We can sell this."

274
00:13:01.222 --> 00:13:03.985 line:15% 
I said, "Sell what?"

275
00:13:03.985 --> 00:13:05.841 line:15% 
He said, "What you just did!"

276
00:13:05.841 --> 00:13:07.739 line:15% 
I said, "Well, I didn't do anything."

277
00:13:07.739 --> 00:13:09.019 line:15% 
He said, "Yeah, you did, you showed me

278
00:13:09.019 --> 00:13:10.161 line:15% 
"how to get rid of stage fright.

279
00:13:10.161 --> 00:13:11.345 line:15% 
"Can you write it down?"

280
00:13:11.345 --> 00:13:12.592 line:15% 
I said, "Yeah, I can write it."

281
00:13:12.592 --> 00:13:15.174 line:15% 
So I wrote a little pamphlet, and we called it

282
00:13:15.174 --> 00:13:19.519 line:15% 
Mental Dynamics: The Key to Nerve Control.

283
00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:21.770 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Now, what year was this?</v>

284
00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.650 line:15% 
<v ->This was in 1951.</v>

285
00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:26.740 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>1951, okay.</v>
<v Burt>1951.</v>

286
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.876 line:15% 
Now, what do we do with it?

287
00:13:29.876 --> 00:13:31.124 line:15% 
We're both kids!

288
00:13:32.994 --> 00:13:36.052 line:15% 
I mean a 21 year old today is not a kid,

289
00:13:36.052 --> 00:13:37.961 line:15% 
but then, it was a different world.

290
00:13:37.961 --> 00:13:40.329 line:15% 
We were, even though I had been in the army,

291
00:13:40.329 --> 00:13:42.953 line:15% 
I had been all over Asia there,

292
00:13:42.953 --> 00:13:46.760 line:15% 
I'd been in Kwajalein, Okinawa and Tokyo,

293
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.571 line:15% 
but we were still ignorant about a lot of things.

294
00:13:51.571 --> 00:13:53.395 line:15% 
So, what do, how do we sell it?

295
00:13:53.395 --> 00:13:57.512 line:15% 
We put an ad in Popular Science Magazine

296
00:13:57.512 --> 00:14:00.701 line:15% 
and Popular Mechanics and we're selling

297
00:14:00.701 --> 00:14:03.741 line:15% 
the key to nerve control for $10,

298
00:14:03.741 --> 00:14:05.554 line:15% 
which was a lot of money, then.

299
00:14:05.554 --> 00:14:09.340 line:15% 
The first order we get is from New Zealand,

300
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.823 line:15% 
or someplace like that.

301
00:14:10.823 --> 00:14:12.636 line:15% 
Well, boy were we thrilled.

302
00:14:12.636 --> 00:14:15.484 line:15% 
Oh, we got an order from outside the United States!

303
00:14:17.494 --> 00:14:21.851 line:15% 
We kept it up for a few months,

304
00:14:21.851 --> 00:14:26.449 line:15% 
and then we'd do something else, and we left it.

305
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:28.780 line:15% 
Then, years later, I heard

306
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:33.780 line:15% 
about Silva Mind Control,

307
00:14:34.352 --> 00:14:36.560 line:15% 
and I thought, "Mind control,

308
00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.811 line:15% 
"that's similar to nerve control."

309
00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:40.667 line:15% 
"I wonder what that's all about?"

310
00:14:40.667 --> 00:14:45.637 line:15% 
So I went to a lecture by a Silva instructor,

311
00:14:45.637 --> 00:14:49.007 line:15% 
and I heard him talk, and I said, "That's interesting."

312
00:14:49.007 --> 00:14:51.429 line:15% 
Is it meditation, well, no, it's not.

313
00:14:51.429 --> 00:14:54.842 line:15% 
Well, let me say, one thing leads to another, and I,

314
00:14:54.842 --> 00:14:58.628 line:15% 
I took the course, and I recognized everything in the course

315
00:14:58.628 --> 00:15:03.311 line:15% 
that I had learned before, and that I was actually teaching.

316
00:15:03.311 --> 00:15:07.033 line:15% 
A lot of the stuff came out of Rosicrucianism stuff

317
00:15:07.033 --> 00:15:09.092 line:15% 
that I was familiar with also.

318
00:15:09.092 --> 00:15:13.565 line:15% 
I'm leaving 95% out of the story, obviously--

319
00:15:14.345 --> 00:15:16.367 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Or we would need 12 hours of tape.</v>

320
00:15:16.367 --> 00:15:20.798 line:15% 
<v ->You'd need 12 hours just to get out of Korea!</v>

321
00:15:21.166 --> 00:15:23.428 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>But, just maybe drop a little bit in</v>

322
00:15:23.428 --> 00:15:24.814 line:15% 
on the Rosicrucianism studies.

323
00:15:24.814 --> 00:15:26.329 line:15% 
Where'd you pick that up?

324
00:15:26.329 --> 00:15:29.784 line:15% 
<v ->Well, that was all by mail, that was in the '50s.</v>

325
00:15:29.784 --> 00:15:31.480 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>In the '50s, okay.</v>

326
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.659 line:15% 
<v ->I was a hypnotist also, at that time.</v>

327
00:15:34.659 --> 00:15:36.429 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Okay, and so now you've bumped into</v>

328
00:15:36.429 --> 00:15:37.629 line:15% 
Silva Mind Control.

329
00:15:37.629 --> 00:15:42.168 line:15% 
<v ->Now I bumped into Silva, and I took the course,</v>

330
00:15:42.168 --> 00:15:45.858 line:15% 
and I'm thinking, "I know more than this guy."

331
00:15:45.858 --> 00:15:48.919 line:15% 
So I joined the organization,

332
00:15:48.919 --> 00:15:52.706 line:15% 
and at the time, I was also a hot shot salesman,

333
00:15:52.706 --> 00:15:55.031 line:15% 
and I said, "This is not..."

334
00:15:55.031 --> 00:15:56.812 line:15% 
I called a friend of mine, I said,

335
00:15:56.812 --> 00:15:58.444 line:15% 
"You've got to get into this Silva."

336
00:15:58.444 --> 00:15:59.927 line:15% 
He says, "Why?"

337
00:15:59.927 --> 00:16:02.988 line:15% 
I said, "Because whatever you say about it is true!

338
00:16:02.988 --> 00:16:05.804 line:15% 
"You can't lie, you can't exaggerate."

339
00:16:05.804 --> 00:16:09.889 line:15% 
So he comes to one of the seminars, and he says,

340
00:16:09.889 --> 00:16:12.395 line:15% 
"Can you back up all that stuff?"

341
00:16:12.395 --> 00:16:14.976 line:15% 
I said, "Yeah, look at all these testimonials."

342
00:16:14.976 --> 00:16:16.598 line:15% 
Anyway, one thing leads to another,

343
00:16:16.598 --> 00:16:21.451 line:15% 
and about six months after I joined the organization

344
00:16:21.451 --> 00:16:23.328 line:15% 
they've got like 1,000 instructors,

345
00:16:23.328 --> 00:16:26.261 line:15% 
and guess who's their top instructor?

346
00:16:26.261 --> 00:16:27.840 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>I'm guessing it'd be you.</v>

347
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.738 line:15% 
(laughter)

348
00:16:29.738 --> 00:16:33.364 line:15% 
<v ->Everybody's got classes of five and ten,</v>

349
00:16:33.364 --> 00:16:37.236 line:15% 
and I've got classes of 150 and 200.

350
00:16:37.236 --> 00:16:39.444 line:15% 
As a matter of fact, the hotel that I was using,

351
00:16:39.444 --> 00:16:42.740 line:15% 
the Holiday Inn in Van Nuys, which doesn't exist anymore

352
00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.524 line:15% 
because of the Northridge earthquake,

353
00:16:46.874 --> 00:16:51.454 line:15% 
it only held 200, so I had to shun people away,

354
00:16:51.454 --> 00:16:54.611 line:15% 
and I was doing classes twice a month.

355
00:16:54.611 --> 00:16:57.534 line:15% 
At any rate, I worked with Silva for awhile,

356
00:16:57.534 --> 00:17:01.117 line:15% 
and Jose asked me to write a book,

357
00:17:01.117 --> 00:17:02.973 line:15% 
or I told him I was going to write a book

358
00:17:02.973 --> 00:17:05.405 line:15% 
with a friend of mine called Better and Better,

359
00:17:05.405 --> 00:17:07.848 line:15% 
which was about the Silva class which we did,

360
00:17:07.848 --> 00:17:10.450 line:15% 
and that's when I discovered I could write.

361
00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:11.495 line:15% 
I said, "Wow."

362
00:17:11.495 --> 00:17:14.855 line:15% 
Now, where I got writing from is an interesting aside,

363
00:17:14.855 --> 00:17:17.970 line:15% 
if you'll allow it.

364
00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:18.940 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Please!</v>

365
00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:23.940 line:15% 
<v ->A friend of mine, a guy named Willy Lee, Chinese guy,</v>

366
00:17:25.584 --> 00:17:28.582 line:15% 
not that it matters whether he's Chinese or not,

367
00:17:28.582 --> 00:17:33.582 line:15% 
he had a wrought iron furniture,

368
00:17:33.739 --> 00:17:36.538 line:15% 
outdoor furniture place

369
00:17:36.538 --> 00:17:39.083 line:15% 
in a large building, a 20,000 square foot building,

370
00:17:39.083 --> 00:17:41.152 line:15% 
and I was visiting him one day,

371
00:17:41.152 --> 00:17:42.795 line:15% 
and I'm sitting in his office.

372
00:17:42.795 --> 00:17:47.648 line:15% 
Now, his building is the big box with an office.

373
00:17:47.648 --> 00:17:51.392 line:15% 
That's it, but it's big, 20,000 square feet.

374
00:17:51.392 --> 00:17:54.474 line:15% 
And we're sitting, and we're talking, and I said,

375
00:17:54.474 --> 00:17:56.266 line:15% 
"How much rent do you pay here?"

376
00:17:56.266 --> 00:17:58.335 line:15% 
And he said, "Oh, I don't pay rent."

377
00:17:58.335 --> 00:17:59.978 line:15% 
He said, "I own the building."

378
00:17:59.978 --> 00:18:01.066 line:15% 
I said, "Oh, you own the building?"

379
00:18:01.066 --> 00:18:02.047 line:15% 
He says, "Yeah."

380
00:18:02.047 --> 00:18:02.932 line:15% 
I said, "You bought it?"

381
00:18:02.932 --> 00:18:04.116 line:15% 
He says, "No, I built it."

382
00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:05.577 line:15% 
"Oh," I says. "You had it built?"

383
00:18:05.577 --> 00:18:07.220 line:15% 
He says, "No, I built it."

384
00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.756 line:15% 
"I know, but you had it built."

385
00:18:08.756 --> 00:18:11.358 line:15% 
"No, no, no, no, I built it."

386
00:18:11.358 --> 00:18:12.841 line:15% 
I said, "What do you mean you built it.

387
00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:14.974 line:15% 
"You didn't build it, you hired people."

388
00:18:14.974 --> 00:18:19.038 line:15% 
"Damn it," he says. "Burt, don't you understand English?

389
00:18:19.038 --> 00:18:20.968 line:15% 
"I built it!"

390
00:18:20.968 --> 00:18:22.568 line:15% 
I says, "Yeah, but you,"

391
00:18:22.568 --> 00:18:25.128 line:15% 
He says, "You see the pile of bricks?"

392
00:18:25.128 --> 00:18:26.984 line:15% 
There was a little pile of bricks in the corner.

393
00:18:26.984 --> 00:18:27.891 line:15% 
I said, "Yeah."

394
00:18:27.891 --> 00:18:29.747 line:15% 
He says, "Get to 'em."

395
00:18:29.747 --> 00:18:33.416 line:15% 
So I get to the bricks, I said, "What now?"

396
00:18:33.416 --> 00:18:35.335 line:15% 
He says, "Put one on top of the other."

397
00:18:35.335 --> 00:18:38.151 line:15% 
So I put one on top of the other, and I look at him.

398
00:18:38.151 --> 00:18:40.658 line:15% 
He says, "That's all I did.

399
00:18:40.658 --> 00:18:42.258 line:15% 
"You're looking at the whole thing,

400
00:18:42.258 --> 00:18:44.231 line:15% 
"this building is just one brick at a time.

401
00:18:44.231 --> 00:18:45.863 line:15% 
"I built it."

402
00:18:45.863 --> 00:18:47.975 line:15% 
I said, "You actually built this whole building?"

403
00:18:47.975 --> 00:18:50.823 line:15% 
"I did the brick work, I did the cement work,

404
00:18:50.823 --> 00:18:53.916 line:15% 
"I did the electrical work, and I did the plumbing.

405
00:18:53.916 --> 00:18:57.030 line:15% 
"The only thing I didn't do was the roof."

406
00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.259 line:15% 
He says, "I did everything else."

407
00:18:59.259 --> 00:19:04.010 line:15% 
Well, I never forgot that story,

408
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.890 line:15% 
and when I started writing,

409
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:11.679 line:15% 
I started writing and I told my friend Ove Sehested,

410
00:19:11.679 --> 00:19:13.396 line:15% 
who wrote the book Better and Better with me,

411
00:19:13.396 --> 00:19:15.316 line:15% 
"You know, I'm not a writer."

412
00:19:15.316 --> 00:19:17.716 line:15% 
And then I started thinking,

413
00:19:19.186 --> 00:19:23.817 line:15% 
"Wait a minute, I can write a sentence.

414
00:19:23.817 --> 00:19:25.284 line:15% 
"Anybody can write a sentence."

415
00:19:25.284 --> 00:19:27.353 line:15% 
And then I thought of Willy Lee.

416
00:19:27.353 --> 00:19:29.507 line:15% 
What is a book?

417
00:19:29.507 --> 00:19:32.088 line:15% 
A book is a bunch of chapters.

418
00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:33.550 line:15% 
What's a chapter?

419
00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:35.192 line:15% 
A bunch of paragraphs.

420
00:19:35.192 --> 00:19:36.749 line:15% 
What's a paragraph?

421
00:19:36.749 --> 00:19:40.163 line:15% 
A couple of sentences, can you write a sentence?

422
00:19:40.163 --> 00:19:42.509 line:15% 
Sure, if you can write a sentence, you can write a book,

423
00:19:42.509 --> 00:19:45.880 line:15% 
all you have to do is keep writing it and change it.

424
00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.831 line:15% 
<v ->[Voiceover and Burt] One brick at a time, yeah.</v>

425
00:19:48.831 --> 00:19:53.687 line:15% 
<v ->So that's when I started writing, through that Willy Lee.</v>

426
00:19:54.697 --> 00:19:56.294 line:15% 
One other thing, and then we'll leave,

427
00:19:56.294 --> 00:19:57.833 line:15% 
has absolutely nothing to do with anything.

428
00:19:57.833 --> 00:19:59.152 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Okay, go for it.</v>

429
00:19:59.152 --> 00:20:00.713 line:15% 
<v ->Another time I was over at Willy's, he says,</v>

430
00:20:00.713 --> 00:20:04.265 line:15% 
"Come on, I've got a mouse, and I'm going to catch it."

431
00:20:04.265 --> 00:20:06.216 line:15% 
I said, "Well, where is he?"

432
00:20:06.216 --> 00:20:08.115 line:15% 
He said, "I don't know, but I'm going to find out."

433
00:20:08.115 --> 00:20:10.483 line:15% 
I said, "How do you find out where a mouse lives?"

434
00:20:10.483 --> 00:20:12.808 line:15% 
He says, "Come by in the morning, I'll show you."

435
00:20:12.808 --> 00:20:15.709 line:15% 
I come by in the morning, I meet him outside of his office.

436
00:20:15.709 --> 00:20:18.354 line:15% 
He's on Curacao Street in East L.A.,

437
00:20:18.354 --> 00:20:21.906 line:15% 
and he says, "Okay, look."

438
00:20:21.906 --> 00:20:24.583 line:15% 
He opens up the door, and he had spread flour

439
00:20:24.583 --> 00:20:27.975 line:15% 
over the entire floor, and you could see mouse tracks

440
00:20:27.975 --> 00:20:30.316 line:15% 
going to a spot.

441
00:20:30.316 --> 00:20:32.391 line:15% 
He says, "That's where the mouse lives."

442
00:20:32.391 --> 00:20:33.333 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>These are very practical</v>

443
00:20:33.333 --> 00:20:35.445 line:15% 
bits of information you're giving us here.

444
00:20:35.445 --> 00:20:36.724 line:15% 
(laughter)

445
00:20:36.724 --> 00:20:39.348 line:15% 
<v ->How to catch a mouse: spread flour.</v>

446
00:20:39.348 --> 00:20:41.343 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>You can write a book on that one.</v>

447
00:20:43.073 --> 00:20:47.732 line:15% 
<v ->Anyway, then I worked with Silva until 1980, actually,</v>

448
00:20:49.112 --> 00:20:50.793 line:15% 
and then I kind of,

449
00:20:50.793 --> 00:20:53.416 line:15% 
I don't want to do the same thing

450
00:20:53.416 --> 00:20:55.922 line:15% 
over and over again, which is what I was doing there,

451
00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:58.386 line:15% 
even though I was bringing a lot of my own stuff in.

452
00:21:01.216 --> 00:21:05.010 line:15% 
I started something called Super Mind,

453
00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:09.368 line:15% 
and I went over to Jose, and I said, "Jose,"

454
00:21:09.368 --> 00:21:11.761 line:15% 
and Chief, we used to call him chief, I said,

455
00:21:11.761 --> 00:21:15.053 line:15% 
"Chief, I've got something a little different.

456
00:21:15.053 --> 00:21:18.508 line:15% 
"It's called Super Mind, and I'd like to teach it

457
00:21:18.508 --> 00:21:21.207 line:15% 
"to your instructors and your people."

458
00:21:21.207 --> 00:21:22.508 line:15% 
He said, "Well, tell me about it."

459
00:21:22.508 --> 00:21:24.065 line:15% 
So I did, and we had a meeting

460
00:21:24.065 --> 00:21:26.177 line:15% 
with him and a few other people there,

461
00:21:26.177 --> 00:21:30.651 line:15% 
and he said, "Okay, you can do it for my people."

462
00:21:31.606 --> 00:21:33.835 line:15% 
So I did, so I started teaching Super Mind,

463
00:21:33.835 --> 00:21:38.571 line:15% 
which is a combination of hypnosis, what I had learned,

464
00:21:40.611 --> 00:21:42.368 line:15% 
the Huna stuff that I knew,

465
00:21:42.368 --> 00:21:46.571 line:15% 
and it was a melange of different material,

466
00:21:46.571 --> 00:21:49.749 line:15% 
but it took off like a shot, everybody loved it,

467
00:21:49.749 --> 00:21:53.098 line:15% 
and wherever I went, there were three, 400 people.

468
00:21:53.098 --> 00:21:57.098 line:15% 
I went to Greece once, and the room held 500 people,

469
00:21:57.098 --> 00:21:59.423 line:15% 
and 1,200 showed up!

470
00:21:59.423 --> 00:22:00.490 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Oh, my god!</v>

471
00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.015 line:15% 
<v ->You can't even imagine what was going</v>

472
00:22:02.015 --> 00:22:04.692 line:15% 
on in Athens; they had to call the police!

473
00:22:04.692 --> 00:22:05.972 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>It's interesting because the early '80's</v>

474
00:22:05.972 --> 00:22:08.361 line:15% 
was really a time, it was an explosive time

475
00:22:08.361 --> 00:22:11.753 line:15% 
for what's now becoming a little more mainstream

476
00:22:11.753 --> 00:22:14.345 line:15% 
in terms of understanding there's more to the mind.

477
00:22:14.345 --> 00:22:17.897 line:15% 
The human potential movement had really started taking root.

478
00:22:17.897 --> 00:22:19.883 line:15% 
<v ->Yes, the '80s, that's when EST came out,</v>

479
00:22:19.883 --> 00:22:24.436 line:15% 
that's when NLP started,

480
00:22:24.837 --> 00:22:26.299 line:15% 
Van Lauren Griffin,

481
00:22:27.349 --> 00:22:31.454 line:15% 
Bandler, Richard Bandler, and well, whoever.

482
00:22:32.974 --> 00:22:35.120 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Grindler.</v>
<v Burt>Grindler, thank you.</v>

483
00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.107 line:15% 
<v ->I know it like I know my own name:</v>

484
00:22:38.107 --> 00:22:40.763 line:15% 
sometimes it slips out because I use a lot of NLP

485
00:22:40.763 --> 00:22:42.917 line:15% 
in my material.

486
00:22:42.917 --> 00:22:46.704 line:15% 
At any rate, I started teaching Super Mind,

487
00:22:46.704 --> 00:22:49.434 line:15% 
and then I also,

488
00:22:49.434 --> 00:22:52.581 line:15% 
I knew that Jose had, at one time,

489
00:22:52.581 --> 00:22:55.450 line:15% 
been a hypnotist, and I had been a hypnotist,

490
00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:57.381 line:15% 
so I thought, "Let me bring in hypnotism

491
00:22:57.381 --> 00:22:59.311 line:15% 
"into this organization."

492
00:22:59.311 --> 00:23:01.839 line:15% 
So I started something called Hypnovision,

493
00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:05.316 line:15% 
and I was training people to be hypnotists,

494
00:23:05.316 --> 00:23:08.665 line:15% 
and that was the first time that Jose had let

495
00:23:08.665 --> 00:23:11.289 line:15% 
somebody from outside the organization

496
00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:13.145 line:15% 
in with something like that.

497
00:23:13.145 --> 00:23:16.889 line:15% 
I kept going, jumping from one thing to another,

498
00:23:16.889 --> 00:23:21.272 line:15% 
and then the '90s came around,

499
00:23:21.272 --> 00:23:24.984 line:15% 
and I just kept on bringing in new stuff.

500
00:23:28.638 --> 00:23:33.638 line:15% 
As we evolved,

501
00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:39.460 line:15% 
so to speak, I kept learning by teaching.

502
00:23:39.735 --> 00:23:42.690 line:15% 
You know, the teacher learns also,

503
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:45.847 line:15% 
and I was learning so much,

504
00:23:45.847 --> 00:23:49.730 line:15% 
and then I bumped into quantum mechanics.

505
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.532 line:15% 
Now, I don't know anything about

506
00:23:51.532 --> 00:23:53.740 line:15% 
quantum physics or quantum mechanics.

507
00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.577 line:15% 
It all started when I did a lecture

508
00:24:00.587 --> 00:24:04.128 line:15% 
for Edgar Mitchell, the astronaut.

509
00:24:04.128 --> 00:24:07.635 line:15% 
He has an organization in Petaluma, up north,

510
00:24:07.635 --> 00:24:11.070 line:15% 
and I was asked to lecture before

511
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:14.205 line:15% 
him and the rest of the group,

512
00:24:14.205 --> 00:24:15.859 line:15% 
and I'm very impressed by him, you know.

513
00:24:15.859 --> 00:24:17.203 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yes, lovely man.</v>

514
00:24:17.203 --> 00:24:20.018 line:15% 
<v ->Oh, wonderful, one of the sweetest people.</v>

515
00:24:20.018 --> 00:24:22.173 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>He sure is, yes, I've met him.</v>

516
00:24:22.173 --> 00:24:23.399 line:15% 
<v ->Good.</v>

517
00:24:24.419 --> 00:24:29.415 line:15% 
I kind of got into this quantum physics business,

518
00:24:29.415 --> 00:24:34.272 line:15% 
and some of the physicists believe

519
00:24:34.272 --> 00:24:37.226 line:15% 
in an infinity of universes.

520
00:24:38.536 --> 00:24:43.302 line:15% 
So I started studying infinity, that's like--

521
00:24:43.302 --> 00:24:45.887 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>How do you do that?</v>

522
00:24:45.887 --> 00:24:47.818 line:15% 
<v ->That's what I was about to say:</v>

523
00:24:47.818 --> 00:24:50.548 line:15% 
that's like an ant studying Shakespeare.

524
00:24:50.548 --> 00:24:52.038 line:15% 
(laughter)

525
00:24:52.038 --> 00:24:56.532 line:15% 
I mean, you can't, you can't even imagine infinity,

526
00:24:56.532 --> 00:24:59.279 line:15% 
anymore than you can imagine eternity.

527
00:24:59.279 --> 00:25:00.719 line:15% 
You can't.

528
00:25:00.719 --> 00:25:02.394 line:15% 
You know, people think after they die,

529
00:25:02.394 --> 00:25:03.641 line:15% 
they're going to blow on a cloud,

530
00:25:03.641 --> 00:25:05.295 line:15% 
or they're going to have a nice lovely,

531
00:25:05.295 --> 00:25:07.876 line:15% 
well, fine, I believe that, too, but not on a cloud.

532
00:25:07.876 --> 00:25:12.441 line:15% 
But think about doing the same thing for 100 years,

533
00:25:12.441 --> 00:25:17.441 line:15% 
1,000 years, 100,000 years, a million years!

534
00:25:18.648 --> 00:25:19.839 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>There was an interesting movie</v>

535
00:25:19.839 --> 00:25:23.946 line:15% 
called After Life made by a Japanese independent film crew

536
00:25:23.946 --> 00:25:26.943 line:15% 
that, essentially, that's exactly what they did:

537
00:25:26.943 --> 00:25:28.756 line:15% 
you had to choose the moment

538
00:25:28.756 --> 00:25:31.049 line:15% 
that you most loved in your life,

539
00:25:31.049 --> 00:25:32.927 line:15% 
that was it, forever.

540
00:25:32.927 --> 00:25:35.764 line:15% 
<v ->It would be the worst moment of your life.</v>

541
00:25:35.764 --> 00:25:37.364 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Oh, absolutely.</v>

542
00:25:37.364 --> 00:25:39.198 line:15% 
So going from that, yes.

543
00:25:39.198 --> 00:25:43.454 line:15% 
<v ->So I realized that it's impossible to understand,</v>

544
00:25:43.454 --> 00:25:45.587 line:15% 
but can we make use of it?

545
00:25:45.587 --> 00:25:47.603 line:15% 
See, I like to make use of things.

546
00:25:47.603 --> 00:25:49.022 line:15% 
Everything that I've ever learned,

547
00:25:49.022 --> 00:25:51.528 line:15% 
it has to be useful, and one of the reasons

548
00:25:51.528 --> 00:25:54.312 line:15% 
I was always so very popular as an instructor

549
00:25:54.312 --> 00:25:55.848 line:15% 
is because everything that I taught

550
00:25:55.848 --> 00:25:58.077 line:15% 
was simple and easy to use.

551
00:25:58.077 --> 00:26:00.872 line:15% 
It had to be useful, had to be useful.

552
00:26:00.872 --> 00:26:02.002 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>It had to be effective.</v>

553
00:26:02.002 --> 00:26:03.975 line:15% 
<v ->And effective, yes.</v>

554
00:26:03.975 --> 00:26:07.644 line:15% 
Turned into a resource that other people could use.

555
00:26:07.644 --> 00:26:11.527 line:15% 
Never mind what I can do, can you do it?

556
00:26:11.527 --> 00:26:12.913 line:15% 
And if I can do it, you can do it.

557
00:26:12.913 --> 00:26:15.313 line:15% 
I'm just a plain, ordinary kid from Brooklyn.

558
00:26:15.313 --> 00:26:17.884 line:15% 
Well, I'm not a kid anymore, but I'm still from Brooklyn.

559
00:26:17.884 --> 00:26:19.910 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>With a massive amount</v>

560
00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:22.364 line:15% 
of amassed knowledge over time.

561
00:26:22.364 --> 00:26:24.987 line:15% 
<v ->With some knowledge, exactly.</v>

562
00:26:24.987 --> 00:26:28.592 line:15% 
So this infinity intrigued me.

563
00:26:28.592 --> 00:26:33.563 line:15% 
Now, if it's true infinity, it's endless.

564
00:26:33.563 --> 00:26:36.645 line:15% 
There's no definition of infinity,

565
00:26:36.645 --> 00:26:39.408 line:15% 
and so I've come up with my own definition:

566
00:26:39.408 --> 00:26:43.109 line:15% 
one more, that's infinity.

567
00:26:43.109 --> 00:26:45.871 line:15% 
Whatever you can conceive of, one more.

568
00:26:45.871 --> 00:26:48.559 line:15% 
20 million, one more.

569
00:26:48.559 --> 00:26:51.002 line:15% 
One more, or one more 20 million?

570
00:26:51.002 --> 00:26:55.225 line:15% 
Whatever, one more; it's endless.

571
00:26:55.225 --> 00:26:59.097 line:15% 
That being the case, there are an endless number

572
00:26:59.097 --> 00:27:01.678 line:15% 
of universes and dimensions.

573
00:27:01.678 --> 00:27:03.865 line:15% 
A lot of physicists believe that.

574
00:27:03.865 --> 00:27:05.529 line:15% 
They can't tap into them.

575
00:27:05.529 --> 00:27:08.718 line:15% 
<v  Voiceover>They can validate they exist,</v>

576
00:27:08.718 --> 00:27:13.240 line:15% 
even if they don't know what can be done within them.

577
00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.864 line:15% 
<v ->Exactly, now a lot of them believe,</v>

578
00:27:15.864 --> 00:27:20.141 line:15% 
the ones that believe in infinity,

579
00:27:20.141 --> 00:27:23.810 line:15% 
that in one of those universes, as an example,

580
00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:26.711 line:15% 
using us here, I'm sitting in your chair,

581
00:27:26.711 --> 00:27:29.197 line:15% 
and you're sitting here, and I'm interviewing you.

582
00:27:29.197 --> 00:27:31.885 line:15% 
In another one, you are the Queen of England.

583
00:27:31.885 --> 00:27:33.676 line:15% 
In another one, you're homeless.

584
00:27:33.676 --> 00:27:37.804 line:15% 
In another one, the year is 3038.

585
00:27:37.804 --> 00:27:39.383 line:15% 
In another one, it's prehistoric.

586
00:27:39.383 --> 00:27:42.081 line:15% 
Whatever you can conceive, is.

587
00:27:42.081 --> 00:27:45.377 line:15% 
In an infinite universe, there is no future,

588
00:27:45.377 --> 00:27:48.001 line:15% 
there is no past, everything is now.

589
00:27:48.001 --> 00:27:53.001 line:15% 
Everything is happening right now, if it's infinity.

590
00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:57.728 line:15% 
Now also, you have a duplicate self,

591
00:27:57.728 --> 00:28:00.032 line:15% 
what is called a doppelgänger.

592
00:28:00.032 --> 00:28:03.904 line:15% 
Doppelgänger is a German word, it means, "double walker."

593
00:28:03.904 --> 00:28:06.805 line:15% 
What it is, is a twin self.

594
00:28:06.805 --> 00:28:10.015 line:15% 
That twin self of yours, who is the Queen of England,

595
00:28:10.015 --> 00:28:14.143 line:15% 
is in fact the Queen of England in that particular dimension

596
00:28:14.143 --> 00:28:15.882 line:15% 
the homeless one is also homeless.

597
00:28:15.882 --> 00:28:18.004 line:15% 
Whatever you can imagine is.

598
00:28:18.004 --> 00:28:19.903 line:15% 
That explains a lot.

599
00:28:19.903 --> 00:28:23.647 line:15% 
Now, God is also infinite,

600
00:28:23.647 --> 00:28:26.057 line:15% 
meaning that God is everywhere,

601
00:28:26.057 --> 00:28:29.353 line:15% 
in everything; God is all.

602
00:28:30.973 --> 00:28:33.790 line:15% 
I like the expression,

603
00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:38.130 line:15% 
when God said, "I am that I am."

604
00:28:38.899 --> 00:28:42.557 line:15% 
What if we put a comma in there and say,

605
00:28:42.557 --> 00:28:46.855 line:15% 
"I am that, I am."

606
00:28:46.855 --> 00:28:51.855 line:15% 
I am that, that, that, that, everything, everything.

607
00:28:52.146 --> 00:28:57.146 line:15% 
Infinity means, literally whatever you can imagine is.

608
00:28:57.276 --> 00:29:02.276 line:15% 
Now that's not my concept, that's a concept of

609
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.782 line:15% 
the physicists, many of the quantum physicists.

610
00:29:07.782 --> 00:29:09.979 line:15% 
Not all of them, but a great many of them.

611
00:29:09.979 --> 00:29:11.814 line:15% 
All of them smarter than me.

612
00:29:11.814 --> 00:29:13.979 line:15% 
What does that mean now?

613
00:29:13.979 --> 00:29:16.016 line:15% 
But what they don't tell you is,

614
00:29:16.016 --> 00:29:19.227 line:15% 
how to tap into that, and that's what I worked on.

615
00:29:19.227 --> 00:29:21.221 line:15% 
They work on the physical part;

616
00:29:21.221 --> 00:29:24.506 line:15% 
that's what physics is, physics is the physical.

617
00:29:24.506 --> 00:29:26.757 line:15% 
I work on the metaphysical.

618
00:29:26.757 --> 00:29:28.037 line:15% 
What is metaphysical?

619
00:29:28.037 --> 00:29:29.989 line:15% 
Well, meta means beyond, so we're going

620
00:29:29.989 --> 00:29:32.772 line:15% 
beyond physics, now, to tap into it.

621
00:29:32.772 --> 00:29:33.903 line:15% 
"I wonder," I thought.

622
00:29:33.903 --> 00:29:36.559 line:15% 
"Could I tap into a doppelgänger of mine

623
00:29:36.559 --> 00:29:38.340 line:15% 
"who is something else?"

624
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.057 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Now, did this come about,</v>

625
00:29:40.057 --> 00:29:42.735 line:15% 
again, just kind of looking at where you were,

626
00:29:42.735 --> 00:29:44.132 line:15% 
is this something you had already,

627
00:29:44.132 --> 00:29:46.009 line:15% 
inherently been tapping into from

628
00:29:46.009 --> 00:29:48.142 line:15% 
your early days in meditation, or did this concept

629
00:29:48.142 --> 00:29:52.718 line:15% 
really become full bloom in your 50s, by this time?

630
00:29:54.008 --> 00:29:59.008 line:15% 
<v ->When I was teaching Super Mind,</v>

631
00:30:01.777 --> 00:30:05.230 line:15% 
I was playing golf during that time,

632
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:07.598 line:15% 
I was playing gold with some friends,

633
00:30:07.598 --> 00:30:10.648 line:15% 
and I didn't get to play golf that often,

634
00:30:10.648 --> 00:30:14.168 line:15% 
and I was playing, and it was a hot day.

635
00:30:14.168 --> 00:30:19.096 line:15% 
Usually I'll go 110,

636
00:30:19.096 --> 00:30:21.560 line:15% 
if I broke 100 it was a miracle

637
00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.855 line:15% 
playing 18 holes, and it was a hot day,

638
00:30:24.855 --> 00:30:27.714 line:15% 
and I'm sitting there and I'm thinking while we're waiting

639
00:30:29.274 --> 00:30:33.867 line:15% 
to get to the first tee, I'm sitting and I'm meditating.

640
00:30:33.867 --> 00:30:36.310 line:15% 
Now, when you meditate, generally,

641
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:37.856 line:15% 
you're not thinking of anything,

642
00:30:37.856 --> 00:30:40.064 line:15% 
but it's impossible to think of nothing.

643
00:30:40.064 --> 00:30:41.525 line:15% 
You have to think of something.

644
00:30:41.525 --> 00:30:46.525 line:15% 
So usually, you think of your mantra, which I use Om.

645
00:30:46.688 --> 00:30:50.837 line:15% 
I'm sitting and meditating on Om,

646
00:30:50.837 --> 00:30:54.868 line:15% 
and I'm thinking, "Gee, if only I could be a good golfer,

647
00:30:54.868 --> 00:30:56.746 line:15% 
"just for today."

648
00:30:59.106 --> 00:31:04.106 line:15% 
And then I'm thinking of another golfer, and I said,

649
00:31:05.129 --> 00:31:07.081 line:15% 
"I know what I'm going to do.

650
00:31:07.081 --> 00:31:10.910 line:15% 
"I'm going to take that golfer and slip his body over mine."

651
00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:12.883 line:15% 
Now, I don't know why I thought of that.

652
00:31:12.883 --> 00:31:16.435 line:15% 
This came to me in a meditation.

653
00:31:16.435 --> 00:31:21.341 line:15% 
The golfer I'm thinking of is a golfer named Tony Lema,

654
00:31:21.341 --> 00:31:22.707 line:15% 
goes back a long time.

655
00:31:22.707 --> 00:31:23.848 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>I remember Tony Lema.</v>

656
00:31:23.848 --> 00:31:26.056 line:15% 
<v ->He died some years ago.</v>

657
00:31:26.056 --> 00:31:31.056 line:15% 
We go to the first tee, and I slip Tony's body over my own

658
00:31:31.325 --> 00:31:35.229 line:15% 
and I said, "Okay, Tony, you hit the ball."

659
00:31:35.229 --> 00:31:38.012 line:15% 
And I'm standing, the whole time I'm thinking,

660
00:31:38.012 --> 00:31:39.986 line:15% 
"This is foolish, but I'll give it a try."

661
00:31:39.986 --> 00:31:43.143 line:15% 
And boy, I took a shot, and it went up like a

662
00:31:43.143 --> 00:31:44.348 line:15% 
(laughter)

663
00:31:44.348 --> 00:31:47.046 line:15% 
like it was on a string.

664
00:31:47.046 --> 00:31:48.902 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Shocked yourself and your companions.</v>

665
00:31:48.902 --> 00:31:51.729 line:15% 
<v ->"Wow, what a shot! Boy, that was lucky!"</v>

666
00:31:51.729 --> 00:31:54.747 line:15% 
Well, you know, even 100 handicap,

667
00:31:54.747 --> 00:31:56.817 line:15% 
if there was such a thing, once in a while,

668
00:31:56.817 --> 00:31:58.950 line:15% 
you're going to get off a good shot.

669
00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:03.950 line:15% 
Well, the first nine, I went around at par, 36,

670
00:32:04.667 --> 00:32:07.429 line:15% 
which is impossible, not possible.

671
00:32:07.429 --> 00:32:08.773 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>That's professional level.</v>

672
00:32:08.773 --> 00:32:10.842 line:15% 
<v ->And my friends are looking at me,</v>

673
00:32:10.842 --> 00:32:12.741 line:15% 
"What's going on?"

674
00:32:12.741 --> 00:32:16.111 line:15% 
I don't know, I've got to test something.

675
00:32:16.111 --> 00:32:21.111 line:15% 
So I'm standing now, close my eyes, like meditation,

676
00:32:21.263 --> 00:32:22.933 line:15% 
I said, "Okay, Tony, you can leave."

677
00:32:22.933 --> 00:32:25.408 line:15% 
And I like, threw him away.

678
00:32:25.408 --> 00:32:28.992 line:15% 
The second nine, I think I had about a 70.

679
00:32:28.992 --> 00:32:31.669 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Back to normal, and worse.</v>

680
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:34.079 line:15% 
<v ->Back to my 100!</v>

681
00:32:34.079 --> 00:32:36.820 line:15% 
Well, that was the first time I did anything like that.

682
00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:41.044 line:15% 
I started thinking, "I got to investigate this."

683
00:32:41.044 --> 00:32:42.463 line:15% 
Now I had never heard of,

684
00:32:42.463 --> 00:32:44.927 line:15% 
this is before quantum jumping came about,

685
00:32:44.927 --> 00:32:46.964 line:15% 
this is before I knew anything

686
00:32:46.964 --> 00:32:48.852 line:15% 
about quantum physics or anything,

687
00:32:48.852 --> 00:32:53.852 line:15% 
but I felt something happen, I tapped into something.

688
00:32:54.163 --> 00:32:57.182 line:15% 
I started doing that,

689
00:32:57.182 --> 00:32:59.486 line:15% 
and started teaching other people to do that,

690
00:32:59.486 --> 00:33:03.656 line:15% 
to put the body of another person on and get that energy,

691
00:33:03.656 --> 00:33:07.656 line:15% 
and in the meantime, investigating all that.

692
00:33:07.656 --> 00:33:10.536 line:15% 
Then, when quantum mechanics came about,

693
00:33:10.536 --> 00:33:13.501 line:15% 
(coughs) excuse me,

694
00:33:13.501 --> 00:33:17.889 line:15% 
no, before that, let me back up a bit.

695
00:33:18.247 --> 00:33:22.055 line:15% 
I'm teaching a class in San Diego.

696
00:33:24.405 --> 00:33:28.412 line:15% 
It was a class in creativity,

697
00:33:28.412 --> 00:33:30.737 line:15% 
I used to do classes in creativity.

698
00:33:30.737 --> 00:33:34.566 line:15% 
It was a two weekend class, and now,

699
00:33:34.566 --> 00:33:37.265 line:15% 
I drive in, so I'm staying at a hotel,

700
00:33:37.265 --> 00:33:40.123 line:15% 
and on the second day, somebody says,

701
00:33:40.123 --> 00:33:41.307 line:15% 
"You know, this is interesting,

702
00:33:41.307 --> 00:33:45.596 line:15% 
"but why don't you prove it with yourself?"

703
00:33:45.596 --> 00:33:50.482 line:15% 
I says, "I am creative, I created."

704
00:33:50.482 --> 00:33:52.754 line:15% 
"Yeah, but you just created that to make money."

705
00:33:52.754 --> 00:33:54.983 line:15% 
I said, "No, no, I don't do this for that reason.

706
00:33:54.983 --> 00:33:58.098 line:15% 
"Primarily, I do it to teach people, that's my life."

707
00:33:58.098 --> 00:34:00.465 line:15% 
"Well, be creative at something."

708
00:34:00.465 --> 00:34:02.716 line:15% 
I said, "Well, I don't know, you tell me

709
00:34:02.716 --> 00:34:05.222 line:15% 
"what you want me to be creative at."

710
00:34:05.222 --> 00:34:07.398 line:15% 
"Somebody says, "Play the violin."

711
00:34:07.398 --> 00:34:09.286 line:15% 
I says, "No, no, it can't be that

712
00:34:09.286 --> 00:34:12.027 line:15% 
"because the dexterity is left-brained.

713
00:34:12.027 --> 00:34:14.395 line:15% 
"It's got to be something right-brained

714
00:34:14.395 --> 00:34:17.894 line:15% 
"that doesn't take all that dexterity."

715
00:34:17.894 --> 00:34:21.285 line:15% 
So one thing led to another, and somebody says photography.

716
00:34:21.285 --> 00:34:23.451 line:15% 
I said, "Well, no, I don't know anything about a camera."

717
00:34:23.451 --> 00:34:25.232 line:15% 
"You don't have to know anything about a camera.

718
00:34:25.232 --> 00:34:28.560 line:15% 
"Cameras today, you just point it and shoot."

719
00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.437 line:15% 
This is before digital, by the way.

720
00:34:30.437 --> 00:34:34.223 line:15% 
So, I said, all right, I'll take a shot at it.

721
00:34:35.633 --> 00:34:40.154 line:15% 
So, I go into a meditative state that night,

722
00:34:40.154 --> 00:34:45.154 line:15% 
and I'm thinking of this Tony Lema and golfing,

723
00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:49.156 line:15% 
and I'm thinking, "Is there a great photographer

724
00:34:49.156 --> 00:34:51.204 line:15% 
"that I could emulate?"

725
00:34:51.204 --> 00:34:53.891 line:15% 
Not me, I didn't know anything about quantum jumping

726
00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:55.225 line:15% 
at this point,

727
00:34:55.225 --> 00:34:59.843 line:15% 
and I thought, "There's got to be a great photographer.

728
00:34:59.843 --> 00:35:02.371 line:15% 
"What if I was a great photographer."

729
00:35:02.371 --> 00:35:05.859 line:15% 
I'm meditating, and all of a sudden,

730
00:35:05.859 --> 00:35:09.805 line:15% 
I get an impression of a guy with an old-fashioned camera

731
00:35:09.805 --> 00:35:13.304 line:15% 
with the black hood, the velvet over his head.

732
00:35:13.304 --> 00:35:18.304 line:15% 
And I says, "Hey, I think you're me!"

733
00:35:19.255 --> 00:35:21.388 line:15% 
And I'm talking to myself, and I'm thinking,

734
00:35:21.388 --> 00:35:23.266 line:15% 
"Am I going nuts here, or what?"

735
00:35:23.266 --> 00:35:26.220 line:15% 
I says, "Can you give me some advice

736
00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.417 line:15% 
"on being a photographer?"

737
00:35:29.767 --> 00:35:33.601 line:15% 
I hear, "Take a lot of pictures."

738
00:35:33.601 --> 00:35:36.011 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Well, yeah.</v>

739
00:35:36.011 --> 00:35:38.966 line:15% 
<v ->"Take a lot of pictures, anything else?"</v>

740
00:35:40.866 --> 00:35:43.385 line:15% 
"Take a lot of pictures."

741
00:35:43.385 --> 00:35:48.121 line:15% 
Okay, I'm thinking, I'll take a lot of pictures,

742
00:35:48.121 --> 00:35:51.328 line:15% 
maybe one of them will come out.

743
00:35:51.328 --> 00:35:54.648 line:15% 
So I take a lot of pictures, nothing.

744
00:35:54.648 --> 00:35:57.581 line:15% 
Now, this is like Monday, Tuesday,

745
00:35:57.581 --> 00:36:00.461 line:15% 
I've got till the next weekend to come up with some.

746
00:36:00.461 --> 00:36:01.645 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>To become a genius.</v>

747
00:36:01.645 --> 00:36:03.266 line:15% 
(laughter)

748
00:36:04.216 --> 00:36:08.212 line:15% 
So I go back to the same guy.

749
00:36:08.212 --> 00:36:11.463 line:15% 
I'm quantum jumping, but I don't know it,

750
00:36:11.463 --> 00:36:13.095 line:15% 
I don't realize it.

751
00:36:13.095 --> 00:36:15.719 line:15% 
I see the same guy with his hood, and I say,

752
00:36:15.719 --> 00:36:18.620 line:15% 
"Hey, I took a lot of pictures, but none of them were good!"

753
00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.732 line:15% 
"Plant yourself."

754
00:36:20.732 --> 00:36:22.172 line:15% 
"I beg your pardon?"

755
00:36:22.172 --> 00:36:24.124 line:15% 
"Plant yourself."

756
00:36:24.124 --> 00:36:27.302 line:15% 
"Plant myself, what does that mean?"

757
00:36:27.302 --> 00:36:30.182 line:15% 
And I see he goes like this, go away.

758
00:36:30.182 --> 00:36:34.939 line:15% 
So far, I've got take a lot of pictures, and plant yourself.

759
00:36:34.939 --> 00:36:37.286 line:15% 
Seven words.

760
00:36:39.076 --> 00:36:40.753 line:15% 
Well, that didn't work.

761
00:36:40.753 --> 00:36:43.729 line:15% 
In the meantime, I bought a camera, and I got film.

762
00:36:46.819 --> 00:36:51.078 line:15% 
I'm going back to San Diego.

763
00:36:51.078 --> 00:36:55.142 line:15% 
So I go back to San Diego Saturday morning.

764
00:36:55.142 --> 00:36:58.480 line:15% 
This is the second weekend.

765
00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:04.613 line:15% 
It's early, so I go to the marina to take some pictures,

766
00:37:04.613 --> 00:37:08.613 line:15% 
just to be doing something before I check into my hotel.

767
00:37:08.613 --> 00:37:10.394 line:15% 
I drove in early.

768
00:37:10.394 --> 00:37:14.437 line:15% 
So I go to the marina, and I'm crawling around on some rocks

769
00:37:15.497 --> 00:37:18.724 line:15% 
not crawling, I'm walking around on some rocks,

770
00:37:18.724 --> 00:37:22.106 line:15% 
and they're slippery, so I take my feet,

771
00:37:22.106 --> 00:37:27.106 line:15% 
and I slam them down to "plant myself,"

772
00:37:27.311 --> 00:37:29.145 line:15% 
without realizing it, so I won't slip.

773
00:37:29.145 --> 00:37:34.032 line:15% 
When I put my feet down, I realize,

774
00:37:34.842 --> 00:37:38.190 line:15% 
"Gee, I wonder if that's what was meant, plant yourself."

775
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:41.155 line:15% 
So now, I'm standing in one spot, and I got my camera,

776
00:37:41.155 --> 00:37:43.480 line:15% 
and now, I'm taking a lot of pictures,

777
00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:48.003 line:15% 
planted, without moving, and I take a lot of pictures.

778
00:37:49.943 --> 00:37:54.943 line:15% 
I have them developed, I put them into a 1-hour photography

779
00:37:55.452 --> 00:37:58.811 line:15% 
place that they used to have, and I pick it up,

780
00:37:58.811 --> 00:38:02.704 line:15% 
and that night, I'm laying them all out

781
00:38:02.704 --> 00:38:04.870 line:15% 
on my bed at the hotel,

782
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:08.912 line:15% 
and instead of having 105 or 110 pictures,

783
00:38:08.912 --> 00:38:12.069 line:15% 
I see it's like a jigsaw puzzle, it's one picture.

784
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:15.312 line:15% 
And it's the most amazing picture I'd ever seen!

785
00:38:15.312 --> 00:38:16.570 line:15% 
I says, "Wow!"

786
00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:21.570 line:15% 
So I go out and I buy a foam core board and some glue,

787
00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:25.786 line:15% 
and I'm spending, I'm working until about

788
00:38:25.786 --> 00:38:29.455 line:15% 
one o'clock in the morning gluing the picture together,

789
00:38:29.455 --> 00:38:32.356 line:15% 
and I took it to the class the next day,

790
00:38:32.356 --> 00:38:34.724 line:15% 
and I made a big production out of it,

791
00:38:34.724 --> 00:38:37.369 line:15% 
I walk in with the back of the thing, and I said,

792
00:38:37.369 --> 00:38:41.070 line:15% 
"Okay, this is how I was creative with photography."

793
00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:44.270 line:15% 
I flip it around, and it was just,

794
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:46.339 line:15% 
I mean, they went wild when they saw the pictures.

795
00:38:46.339 --> 00:38:48.472 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>It was, I've seen it, it's wonderful.</v>

796
00:38:48.472 --> 00:38:50.232 line:15% 
<v ->That was the first one.</v>

797
00:38:50.232 --> 00:38:52.771 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>It's amazing, it's a totally different</v>

798
00:38:52.771 --> 00:38:54.765 line:15% 
view of photography.

799
00:38:54.765 --> 00:38:57.922 line:15% 
<v ->Totally, and that was the first time I did it.</v>

800
00:38:57.922 --> 00:39:01.335 line:15% 
Since then, I've taken, well they're all over the place now,

801
00:39:01.335 --> 00:39:02.637 line:15% 
as you see.

802
00:39:02.637 --> 00:39:04.215 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>I love this work.</v>

803
00:39:04.215 --> 00:39:06.540 line:15% 
So obviously, this came out of somewhere else.

804
00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:08.876 line:15% 
This was not previously being done.

805
00:39:08.876 --> 00:39:11.756 line:15% 
<v ->No, no, well, after that, I discovered</v>

806
00:39:11.756 --> 00:39:15.009 line:15% 
that David Hockney was doing something similar.

807
00:39:15.009 --> 00:39:17.121 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Okay, but you weren't aware of it when--</v>

808
00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:19.425 line:15% 
<v ->And Andy Warhol did something similar.</v>

809
00:39:19.425 --> 00:39:22.091 line:15% 
I wasn't aware of any of this at the time.

810
00:39:22.091 --> 00:39:24.225 line:15% 
They were doing something similar, but not the same.

811
00:39:24.225 --> 00:39:26.848 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>So this came from the guy with the black--</v>

812
00:39:26.848 --> 00:39:28.758 line:15% 
<v ->That came from the "plant yourself," yeah.</v>

813
00:39:28.758 --> 00:39:33.728 line:15% 
Later on, when I started developing quantum jumping,

814
00:39:33.728 --> 00:39:38.728 line:15% 
I started thinking, well I had to jump into another universe

815
00:39:38.741 --> 00:39:43.381 line:15% 
because whatever it is that I want, somebody is doing it,

816
00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:46.453 line:15% 
and that somebody is me in another universe.

817
00:39:46.453 --> 00:39:48.724 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about that, that leap or that jump</v>

818
00:39:48.724 --> 00:39:52.788 line:15% 
you took from going to Tony Lema

819
00:39:52.788 --> 00:39:55.369 line:15% 
or the photographer, hooded photographer,

820
00:39:55.369 --> 00:39:57.204 line:15% 
to this understanding.

821
00:39:57.204 --> 00:39:59.892 line:15% 
What happened in that gap there?

822
00:39:59.892 --> 00:40:04.892 line:15% 
<v ->I went on teaching different things--</v>

823
00:40:06.797 --> 00:40:08.094 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>I mean, not so much what you're doing,</v>

824
00:40:08.094 --> 00:40:10.184 line:15% 
but in your consciousness, what shifted

825
00:40:10.184 --> 00:40:11.827 line:15% 
to take you into the awareness

826
00:40:11.827 --> 00:40:14.291 line:15% 
you weren't calling in Tony Lema, but you were

827
00:40:14.291 --> 00:40:17.448 line:15% 
calling in some other dimensional aspect of you?

828
00:40:17.448 --> 00:40:21.608 line:15% 
<v ->That's when I started my study of infinity,</v>

829
00:40:21.608 --> 00:40:25.085 line:15% 
to study the impossible,

830
00:40:25.085 --> 00:40:27.826 line:15% 
my attempt at studying, let us say.

831
00:40:27.826 --> 00:40:32.826 line:15% 
I just got the idea that whatever you can conceive, is.

832
00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:37.180 line:15% 
Whatever; somewhere.

833
00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.486 line:15% 
But we can't, it's like we're in a bubble universe,

834
00:40:40.486 --> 00:40:45.361 line:15% 
as some of the physicists believe.

835
00:40:45.361 --> 00:40:47.931 line:15% 
We're in a bubble universe, and right next to us

836
00:40:47.931 --> 00:40:49.350 line:15% 
is another bubble universe with

837
00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:52.230 line:15% 
the me or you that you want to be,

838
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:54.384 line:15% 
but you can't get out of the bubble.

839
00:40:54.384 --> 00:40:56.475 line:15% 
How can you get out of your bubble, you can't.

840
00:40:56.475 --> 00:40:58.939 line:15% 
The only way you can do it is mentally.

841
00:40:58.939 --> 00:41:01.669 line:15% 
Mentally, there are no bounds.

842
00:41:01.669 --> 00:41:04.752 line:15% 
Mentally, I can be on the other side of the moon right now,

843
00:41:04.752 --> 00:41:06.586 line:15% 
all I got to do is think,

844
00:41:06.586 --> 00:41:09.679 line:15% 
"Well, it's kind of lonely back here, come back."

845
00:41:09.679 --> 00:41:11.717 line:15% 
You can do anything mentally,

846
00:41:11.717 --> 00:41:16.717 line:15% 
and so, maybe I can tap into something mentally, I thought.

847
00:41:17.434 --> 00:41:20.827 line:15% 
So I said, "Let me visit some doppelgängers."

848
00:41:20.827 --> 00:41:23.127 line:15% 
And I went into a meditative state.

849
00:41:23.127 --> 00:41:25.618 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Explain what a doppelgänger is again?</v>

850
00:41:25.618 --> 00:41:30.008 line:15% 
<v ->Doppelgänger is a twin self in another dimension.</v>

851
00:41:31.078 --> 00:41:35.112 line:15% 
That's the way I look at a doppelgänger.

852
00:41:35.112 --> 00:41:37.928 line:15% 
A twin self, you might say.

853
00:41:37.928 --> 00:41:41.032 line:15% 
Mentally, I can do that right now.

854
00:41:41.032 --> 00:41:44.050 line:15% 
I can tap into, and as I'm talking to you,

855
00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:47.837 line:15% 
I can be riding a race car, flying a kite,

856
00:41:50.217 --> 00:41:53.415 line:15% 
conducting an orchestra, whatever.

857
00:41:53.415 --> 00:41:57.764 line:15% 
Now, can you bring that information,

858
00:41:57.764 --> 00:42:00.878 line:15% 
let's say you visit a doppelgänger in another universe

859
00:42:00.878 --> 00:42:05.878 line:15% 
who is a trumpet player, a tap dancer, a photog, whatever.

860
00:42:05.934 --> 00:42:10.188 line:15% 
Can you bring that talent

861
00:42:10.188 --> 00:42:13.324 line:15% 
back to this dimension with you?

862
00:42:13.324 --> 00:42:16.577 line:15% 
Obviously, if you could do that,

863
00:42:16.577 --> 00:42:19.617 line:15% 
everybody would be everything.

864
00:42:19.617 --> 00:42:22.870 line:15% 
So there are bounds, we can't do that.

865
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:26.080 line:15% 
But what we can do is,

866
00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.903 line:15% 
bring back the rhythm, the energy.

867
00:42:28.903 --> 00:42:30.897 line:15% 
Let me explain that.

868
00:42:30.897 --> 00:42:33.276 line:15% 
Everybody has a particular rhythm.

869
00:42:33.276 --> 00:42:35.452 line:15% 
Every place has a particular rhythm.

870
00:42:35.452 --> 00:42:39.985 line:15% 
Every culture has a particular rhythm.

871
00:42:39.985 --> 00:42:44.985 line:15% 
That rhythm is an energy force.

872
00:42:46.928 --> 00:42:51.312 line:15% 
That rhythm is what makes a Van Gogh a Van Gogh,

873
00:42:51.312 --> 00:42:56.312 line:15% 
a Picasso a Picasso, a Van Doran a Van Doran,

874
00:42:57.231 --> 00:43:00.527 line:15% 
a Hawking a Hawking, whatever.

875
00:43:00.527 --> 00:43:05.527 line:15% 
There's a certain rhythm and energy that it's like--

876
00:43:05.914 --> 00:43:09.935 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Is it fair to call it a vibrational effect?</v>

877
00:43:09.935 --> 00:43:12.815 line:15% 
<v ->Well, that's what I was about to get into.</v>

878
00:43:12.815 --> 00:43:16.153 line:15% 
Super Mind, another seminar that I teach,

879
00:43:16.153 --> 00:43:21.153 line:15% 
is based on seven principles.

880
00:43:22.051 --> 00:43:25.326 line:15% 
One of those principles is the principle of vibration.

881
00:43:25.326 --> 00:43:27.512 line:15% 
Another is the principle of rhythm.

882
00:43:27.512 --> 00:43:29.880 line:15% 
Another is the principle of polarity.

883
00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.333 line:15% 
All of these things have an effect.

884
00:43:32.333 --> 00:43:34.562 line:15% 
Now, as an example of principle,

885
00:43:37.882 --> 00:43:41.442 line:15% 
of vibrations, it simply states that all things

886
00:43:41.442 --> 00:43:45.068 line:15% 
are in constant, never ending motion.

887
00:43:45.068 --> 00:43:48.524 line:15% 
All things, a piece of lead, the universe,

888
00:43:48.524 --> 00:43:53.524 line:15% 
all meaning all, constantly vibrating, always moving.

889
00:43:53.655 --> 00:43:55.521 line:15% 
You can see that at the molecular level,

890
00:43:55.521 --> 00:43:59.020 line:15% 
at the subatomic, there's always something moving,

891
00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:02.806 line:15% 
molecules, atoms, moving.

892
00:44:02.806 --> 00:44:07.806 line:15% 
So whatever the movement, that motion, that vibration is

893
00:44:08.448 --> 00:44:11.819 line:15% 
will always manifest to the same degree.

894
00:44:11.819 --> 00:44:14.091 line:15% 
That sounds a little bit like gobbledegook,

895
00:44:14.091 --> 00:44:17.088 line:15% 
so let me explain:

896
00:44:17.088 --> 00:44:19.637 line:15% 
the easiest way to explain is in music.

897
00:44:19.637 --> 00:44:22.773 line:15% 
On the physical scale, the note A,

898
00:44:22.773 --> 00:44:25.791 line:15% 
the first note of the musical scale, A, or Ah,

899
00:44:25.791 --> 00:44:28.863 line:15% 
vibrates at a particular octave,

900
00:44:28.863 --> 00:44:31.743 line:15% 
vibrates 880 times a second.

901
00:44:31.743 --> 00:44:35.263 line:15% 
That's A; that's science; that's physics.

902
00:44:35.263 --> 00:44:38.196 line:15% 
If I could move my finger 880 times a second,

903
00:44:38.196 --> 00:44:42.772 line:15% 
you'd hear a hum, it would be a perfect A, okay.

904
00:44:42.772 --> 00:44:45.342 line:15% 
That we know.

905
00:44:45.342 --> 00:44:47.763 line:15% 
Now, when you're sick, when you have a headache,

906
00:44:47.763 --> 00:44:49.800 line:15% 
when you have a whatever,

907
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:53.075 line:15% 
your vibrations are off, that's all.

908
00:44:53.075 --> 00:44:55.123 line:15% 
Now, let me get back to the A and show you

909
00:44:55.123 --> 00:44:58.621 line:15% 
how and why your vibrations are off.

910
00:44:58.621 --> 00:45:02.429 line:15% 
That 880 is a perfect A.

911
00:45:02.429 --> 00:45:05.703 line:15% 
That's accurate, now I'm guessing.

912
00:45:05.703 --> 00:45:10.375 line:15% 
Let's say you slowed it down to 870,

913
00:45:10.375 --> 00:45:13.042 line:15% 
and you had a guitar, and you're listening,

914
00:45:13.042 --> 00:45:15.506 line:15% 
and you say, "The guitar doesn't sound right.

915
00:45:15.506 --> 00:45:20.103 line:15% 
"It's a little off, you'd better tighten your string."

916
00:45:20.103 --> 00:45:23.910 line:15% 
You might say the guitar had a cold.

917
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:25.510 line:15% 
Vibrations are off a little bit.

918
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:27.323 line:15% 
Let's loosen the string a little more

919
00:45:27.323 --> 00:45:29.851 line:15% 
so it's vibrating at 860.

920
00:45:29.851 --> 00:45:32.155 line:15% 
Pneumonia.

921
00:45:32.155 --> 00:45:34.800 line:15% 
It's still recognizable as an A,

922
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:38.075 line:15% 
but it doesn't sound right.

923
00:45:38.075 --> 00:45:43.075 line:15% 
Loosen it a little more, 850, blang, it died.

924
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:46.320 line:15% 
The vibrations got so far off that the A died.

925
00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.781 line:15% 
Now, you can resurrect an A,

926
00:45:47.781 --> 00:45:49.989 line:15% 
just tighten the string back to 880.

927
00:45:49.989 --> 00:45:52.143 line:15% 
As it is with the guitar string,

928
00:45:52.143 --> 00:45:55.631 line:15% 
so it is with your left shoulder, or any part of your body.

929
00:45:55.631 --> 00:45:58.873 line:15% 
If you have a problem with your left shoulder, basically,

930
00:45:58.873 --> 00:46:02.383 line:15% 
at one particular level, the vibratory level,

931
00:46:02.383 --> 00:46:05.284 line:15% 
it simply means that your vibrations are off.

932
00:46:05.284 --> 00:46:09.838 line:15% 
All that a healer does is raise the vibrations

933
00:46:09.838 --> 00:46:11.161 line:15% 
back to the level.

934
00:46:11.161 --> 00:46:14.435 line:15% 
I've been teaching people healing for many, many years,

935
00:46:14.435 --> 00:46:16.451 line:15% 
decades, actually.

936
00:46:16.451 --> 00:46:19.267 line:15% 
In one of the YouTube things, you'll see me

937
00:46:19.267 --> 00:46:23.437 line:15% 
heal 30 people, boom, just like that, one after the other.

938
00:46:23.437 --> 00:46:26.690 line:15% 
All I'm really doing is just raising my vibration

939
00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:30.690 line:15% 
to the healthy level and transmuting it,

940
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:34.839 line:15% 
or sending it off, exporting it, if you will,

941
00:46:34.839 --> 00:46:39.628 line:15% 
to the recipient and raising their vibrations

942
00:46:39.628 --> 00:46:41.548 line:15% 
to where they're healed.

943
00:46:41.548 --> 00:46:45.036 line:15% 
Now, I've just explained life itself.

944
00:46:45.036 --> 00:46:47.777 line:15% 
All things are involved with this energy.

945
00:46:47.777 --> 00:46:50.956 line:15% 
Now, getting back to the quantum jumping,

946
00:46:50.956 --> 00:46:54.859 line:15% 
when you go to a foreign place,

947
00:46:54.859 --> 00:46:59.520 line:15% 
foreign being out of this dimension, really foreign now,

948
00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:03.029 line:15% 
you're recognizing some things because you're

949
00:47:03.029 --> 00:47:08.029 line:15% 
recognizing yourself as a great artist, let's say,

950
00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:12.106 line:15% 
which is the latest jump that I took, as an artist.

951
00:47:14.896 --> 00:47:18.644 line:15% 
I was 78 when I took this particular jump.

952
00:47:18.644 --> 00:47:20.575 line:15% 
I'm kind of jumping ahead of the story here,

953
00:47:20.575 --> 00:47:22.196 line:15% 
but it's all linked together.

954
00:47:22.196 --> 00:47:24.564 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Time and space are immaterial.</v>

955
00:47:24.564 --> 00:47:26.324 line:15% 
(laughter)

956
00:47:26.324 --> 00:47:31.324 line:15% 
<v ->I knew, I'm always experimenting with myself,</v>

957
00:47:32.062 --> 00:47:34.707 line:15% 
and I knew I couldn't paint.

958
00:47:34.707 --> 00:47:37.193 line:15% 
I knew I wasn't an artist, and drawing,

959
00:47:37.193 --> 00:47:38.729 line:15% 
totally beyond me.

960
00:47:38.729 --> 00:47:43.729 line:15% 
I draw a stick figure, like so, that's my drawing art.

961
00:47:44.371 --> 00:47:48.607 line:15% 
I said, "I wonder if I can become an artist by doing this?"

962
00:47:48.607 --> 00:47:50.527 line:15% 
So, let's see.

963
00:47:50.527 --> 00:47:54.427 line:15% 
So I jumped into a me that was an artist,

964
00:47:54.427 --> 00:47:56.048 line:15% 
that was a great artist.

965
00:47:56.048 --> 00:47:58.949 line:15% 
Now, I can't bring back his ability.

966
00:48:00.429 --> 00:48:04.058 line:15% 
But what I can bring back is his rhythm,

967
00:48:04.058 --> 00:48:05.776 line:15% 
that's what I wanted.

968
00:48:05.776 --> 00:48:09.019 line:15% 
I wanted the rhythm to motivate me.

969
00:48:09.019 --> 00:48:13.776 line:15% 
So I got into another me who was an artist,

970
00:48:13.776 --> 00:48:16.859 line:15% 
and this is five years ago, by the way,

971
00:48:16.859 --> 00:48:19.162 line:15% 
this is fairly recent,

972
00:48:19.162 --> 00:48:23.525 line:15% 
and I went out and I bought some brushes and some paint,

973
00:48:23.525 --> 00:48:25.733 line:15% 
and I started painting.

974
00:48:25.733 --> 00:48:27.727 line:15% 
When I look at those paintings now,

975
00:48:27.727 --> 00:48:30.212 line:15% 
I'm almost embarrassed by them,

976
00:48:30.212 --> 00:48:31.748 line:15% 
but they were paintings.

977
00:48:31.748 --> 00:48:34.596 line:15% 
They were recognizable as flowers,

978
00:48:34.596 --> 00:48:36.825 line:15% 
I started painting flowers.

979
00:48:36.825 --> 00:48:40.868 line:15% 
What that rhythm gave me, what that energy gave me

980
00:48:40.868 --> 00:48:43.982 line:15% 
was the motivation to do it in the first place.

981
00:48:43.982 --> 00:48:46.275 line:15% 
Otherwise, I'd never even thought about it.

982
00:48:46.275 --> 00:48:48.899 line:15% 
So I did it, and I was lousy.

983
00:48:48.899 --> 00:48:51.598 line:15% 
But I was painting.

984
00:48:51.598 --> 00:48:54.360 line:15% 
I didn't consider myself an artist.

985
00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.099 line:15% 
I started painting,

986
00:48:57.699 --> 00:49:01.400 line:15% 
and when I first started painting,

987
00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:07.759 line:15% 
I painted for six months.

988
00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:13.269 line:15% 
I painted 110 canvases in six months.

989
00:49:13.269 --> 00:49:14.752 line:15% 
I couldn't stop painting.

990
00:49:14.752 --> 00:49:17.887 line:15% 
I had gotten the rhythm of this artist.

991
00:49:17.887 --> 00:49:21.748 line:15% 
I'd never read a book on it, and I didn't want to.

992
00:49:21.748 --> 00:49:23.604 line:15% 
I didn't want to take lessons.

993
00:49:23.604 --> 00:49:25.929 line:15% 
I felt that, if I had any natural ability,

994
00:49:25.929 --> 00:49:27.785 line:15% 
that would take away from it.

995
00:49:27.785 --> 00:49:30.335 line:15% 
So to this day, I've never taken a lesson.

996
00:49:30.335 --> 00:49:31.561 line:15% 
I don't know how to mix paint.

997
00:49:31.561 --> 00:49:34.836 line:15% 
I just mix it till I get the right color, and slap it on.

998
00:49:34.836 --> 00:49:36.787 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>It had very much an impressionistic</v>

999
00:49:36.787 --> 00:49:37.811 line:15% 
kind of air to it, yes.

1000
00:49:37.811 --> 00:49:39.806 line:15% 
<v ->That's exactly what I'm looking for.</v>

1001
00:49:39.806 --> 00:49:44.478 line:15% 
I want, if I want an exact replica, I'll take a photograph.

1002
00:49:44.478 --> 00:49:47.336 line:15% 
I want the impression.

1003
00:49:47.336 --> 00:49:49.651 line:15% 
So when you see some of my work there,

1004
00:49:49.651 --> 00:49:52.115 line:15% 
that's an impression of the forest.

1005
00:49:52.115 --> 00:49:53.373 line:15% 
That's what I want.

1006
00:49:53.373 --> 00:49:56.594 line:15% 
I want to elicit an emotion out of you.

1007
00:49:56.594 --> 00:49:58.269 line:15% 
Now, what is an emotion?

1008
00:49:58.269 --> 00:50:00.381 line:15% 
I like to define things so people

1009
00:50:00.381 --> 00:50:02.215 line:15% 
understand what I'm talking about.

1010
00:50:02.215 --> 00:50:06.204 line:15% 
An emotion is any thought that has like or dislike to it.

1011
00:50:06.204 --> 00:50:07.698 line:15% 
I don't care if you like my stuff,

1012
00:50:07.698 --> 00:50:09.041 line:15% 
or if you dislike my stuff--

1013
00:50:09.041 --> 00:50:10.321 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>It's almost like repulsion or attraction,</v>

1014
00:50:10.321 --> 00:50:11.335 line:15% 
it's a feeling.

1015
00:50:11.335 --> 00:50:13.009 line:15% 
<v ->Exactly, that's an emotion.</v>

1016
00:50:13.009 --> 00:50:16.977 line:15% 
As long as I elicit an emotion, I've succeeded.

1017
00:50:16.977 --> 00:50:20.817 line:15% 
Now, if you're neutral about my stuff, that's no good.

1018
00:50:20.817 --> 00:50:22.182 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>It doesn't have the energy.</v>

1019
00:50:22.182 --> 00:50:24.742 line:15% 
<v ->I'd rather you hated it than you were neutral about it.</v>

1020
00:50:24.742 --> 00:50:27.195 line:15% 
Because, if you hate it, there's something about it

1021
00:50:27.195 --> 00:50:30.267 line:15% 
you don't like, so I'm bringing something out in you.

1022
00:50:30.267 --> 00:50:31.771 line:15% 
But most people don't hate my stuff,

1023
00:50:31.771 --> 00:50:33.488 line:15% 
most people like my stuff.

1024
00:50:33.488 --> 00:50:35.163 line:15% 
Now I've started to paint,

1025
00:50:35.163 --> 00:50:38.138 line:15% 
now, finally, after five years,

1026
00:50:38.138 --> 00:50:42.991 line:15% 
I feel like an artist, and now my works are selling.

1027
00:50:42.991 --> 00:50:47.119 line:15% 
I'm asking as much as $12,000 for one of my paintings.

1028
00:50:47.119 --> 00:50:49.487 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Well, that's fabulous.</v>

1029
00:50:49.487 --> 00:50:53.572 line:15% 
This is actually the life's journey of an artist.

1030
00:50:53.572 --> 00:50:56.804 line:15% 
This is the same as it happens for any other artist, too.

1031
00:50:56.804 --> 00:50:59.332 line:15% 
It doesn't pop, they don't pop in one day,

1032
00:50:59.332 --> 00:51:01.284 line:15% 
don't practice, that's it, don't do one or two pieces,

1033
00:51:01.284 --> 00:51:03.022 line:15% 
one-hit wonders, and are out of there,

1034
00:51:03.022 --> 00:51:05.465 line:15% 
like you, hundreds and hundreds of canvases,

1035
00:51:05.465 --> 00:51:06.830 line:15% 
so this is that journey.

1036
00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:10.382 line:15% 
Let's go back now, to before you put that suit on,

1037
00:51:10.382 --> 00:51:13.528 line:15% 
exactly, as I'm listening to you,

1038
00:51:13.528 --> 00:51:15.971 line:15% 
it seems like what's happening is you are,

1039
00:51:15.971 --> 00:51:20.802 line:15% 
you're personalizing the vast multidimensional

1040
00:51:20.802 --> 00:51:22.381 line:15% 
fields of potential.

1041
00:51:22.381 --> 00:51:24.045 line:15% 
<v ->Yes.</v>

1042
00:51:24.045 --> 00:51:25.485 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Everything is possible.</v>

1043
00:51:25.485 --> 00:51:30.485 line:15% 
Any one of us is capable of, really anything, really.

1044
00:51:30.551 --> 00:51:32.706 line:15% 
To go into the fullest potential.

1045
00:51:32.706 --> 00:51:35.500 line:15% 
What you're talking about is putting your face on it,

1046
00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:37.559 line:15% 
personalizing that fully realized

1047
00:51:37.559 --> 00:51:41.281 line:15% 
or fully potential-ized, whatever the word is,

1048
00:51:41.281 --> 00:51:43.926 line:15% 
being out there who does that thing you desire

1049
00:51:43.926 --> 00:51:45.601 line:15% 
to be or do, right?

1050
00:51:45.601 --> 00:51:50.018 line:15% 
<v ->Yes, I believe that anybody,</v>

1051
00:51:50.018 --> 00:51:52.500 line:15% 
everybody has these talents,

1052
00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:56.428 line:15% 
if you will, hidden within them, buried within them,

1053
00:51:56.428 --> 00:51:58.399 line:15% 
some more than others.

1054
00:51:58.399 --> 00:52:02.272 line:15% 
It's true, just as some people are more,

1055
00:52:03.682 --> 00:52:07.317 line:15% 
let's say are stronger in one sense than another.

1056
00:52:08.167 --> 00:52:11.027 line:15% 
We have five senses.

1057
00:52:11.027 --> 00:52:14.344 line:15% 
A Michelangelo comes along very seldom.

1058
00:52:14.344 --> 00:52:17.501 line:15% 
Michelangelo is very strong in the kinetic sense,

1059
00:52:17.501 --> 00:52:20.078 line:15% 
in the tactile sense,

1060
00:52:20.078 --> 00:52:23.569 line:15% 
and also in the visualization sense.

1061
00:52:23.569 --> 00:52:27.111 line:15% 
He was asked once, "How do you do a David?"

1062
00:52:27.111 --> 00:52:28.665 line:15% 
He said, "Well, it's easy.

1063
00:52:28.665 --> 00:52:31.171 line:15% 
"I just see him in the block, and I chip away the excess."

1064
00:52:31.171 --> 00:52:32.238 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>I know, it's amazing,</v>

1065
00:52:32.238 --> 00:52:34.979 line:15% 
and David just radiates beauty, it's so beautiful.

1066
00:52:34.979 --> 00:52:36.813 line:15% 
That's right, he sees it.

1067
00:52:36.813 --> 00:52:39.437 line:15% 
<v ->Whereas a normal person can go from one to ten,</v>

1068
00:52:39.437 --> 00:52:41.922 line:15% 
let's say, in the visual sense,

1069
00:52:41.922 --> 00:52:44.898 line:15% 
a Michelangelo is beyond that, he's,

1070
00:52:44.898 --> 00:52:48.258 line:15% 
on a scale of one to ten, he's 100.

1071
00:52:48.258 --> 00:52:50.701 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Let's say the people that would come,</v>

1072
00:52:50.701 --> 00:52:53.111 line:15% 
the people that would do the quantum jumping course,

1073
00:52:53.111 --> 00:52:55.532 line:15% 
for example, most people are looking to be

1074
00:52:55.532 --> 00:53:00.033 line:15% 
the best they can be at their jobs, at their relationships,

1075
00:53:00.033 --> 00:53:02.796 line:15% 
maybe as an artist, they're not necessarily

1076
00:53:02.796 --> 00:53:05.718 line:15% 
looking to be a Michelangelo, per se,

1077
00:53:05.718 --> 00:53:08.950 line:15% 
but they can, what do you see when people

1078
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:11.019 line:15% 
use the methods that you've created

1079
00:53:11.019 --> 00:53:13.611 line:15% 
and offer in the quantum jumping course?

1080
00:53:13.611 --> 00:53:15.499 line:15% 
What do you see by way of progress,

1081
00:53:15.499 --> 00:53:17.984 line:15% 
and over what period of time with the people?

1082
00:53:17.984 --> 00:53:20.533 line:15% 
<v ->I believe that the, people ask me often</v>

1083
00:53:20.533 --> 00:53:24.064 line:15% 
about that, what value?

1084
00:53:24.064 --> 00:53:29.064 line:15% 
The big value is in attitude because attitude is everything.

1085
00:53:29.354 --> 00:53:34.260 line:15% 
Attitude is what gives you longevity, good health,

1086
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:37.674 line:15% 
and also is what kills you and gives you poor health.

1087
00:53:37.674 --> 00:53:39.572 line:15% 
Attitude is everything.

1088
00:53:39.572 --> 00:53:42.335 line:15% 
Relationships is very important,

1089
00:53:42.335 --> 00:53:45.054 line:15% 
but most people don't know what a relationship is.

1090
00:53:45.054 --> 00:53:48.702 line:15% 
All a relationship is, is a mutual filling of needs.

1091
00:53:48.702 --> 00:53:51.017 line:15% 
If you get two people that are filling each other's needs,

1092
00:53:51.017 --> 00:53:53.481 line:15% 
you got a good relationship.

1093
00:53:53.481 --> 00:53:57.086 line:15% 
So when a person wants to enhance their relationship,

1094
00:53:57.086 --> 00:54:00.930 line:15% 
you don't ask, "How can I enhance my relationship."

1095
00:54:00.930 --> 00:54:05.271 line:15% 
Because that's an abstraction that can't be answered.

1096
00:54:05.271 --> 00:54:09.057 line:15% 
You ask, "How can I fill your important needs,

1097
00:54:09.057 --> 00:54:10.604 line:15% 
"and how can you fill mine?"

1098
00:54:10.604 --> 00:54:14.412 line:15% 
People have a conversation on the wrong subject,

1099
00:54:14.412 --> 00:54:17.110 line:15% 
with regard to relationships.

1100
00:54:17.110 --> 00:54:20.246 line:15% 
Now, the value of quantum jumping is,

1101
00:54:20.246 --> 00:54:23.360 line:15% 
once again, as I say, to bring back

1102
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:28.427 line:15% 
the vibration, the energy or the rhythm,

1103
00:54:28.427 --> 00:54:29.632 line:15% 
I like to use the word rhythm

1104
00:54:29.632 --> 00:54:31.627 line:15% 
because that's what it truly is.

1105
00:54:31.627 --> 00:54:33.994 line:15% 
We're in the desert, now.

1106
00:54:33.994 --> 00:54:36.810 line:15% 
This has a different rhythm than the mountains.

1107
00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:39.573 line:15% 
You feel it, you could be blindfolded and come here--

1108
00:54:39.573 --> 00:54:40.330 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>And certainly different</v>

1109
00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:41.770 line:15% 
than New York City or Brooklyn.

1110
00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:44.842 line:15% 
<v ->Brooklyn, New York, I love to go to New York,</v>

1111
00:54:44.842 --> 00:54:47.530 line:15% 
but I love to leave it, also.

1112
00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:49.418 line:15% 
I can't take it more than three or four days,

1113
00:54:49.418 --> 00:54:52.383 line:15% 
even though I was born there.

1114
00:54:52.383 --> 00:54:55.817 line:15% 
I like the rhythm, people ask me,

1115
00:54:55.817 --> 00:54:58.558 line:15% 
"Why do you live in Rancho Mirage?"

1116
00:54:58.558 --> 00:55:01.182 line:15% 
They asked Frank Sinatra that same question,

1117
00:55:01.182 --> 00:55:04.115 line:15% 
and he said, "Because I like to breathe."

1118
00:55:04.115 --> 00:55:05.758 line:15% 
He likes the air out here.

1119
00:55:05.758 --> 00:55:07.806 line:15% 
I like the rhythm of the place.

1120
00:55:07.806 --> 00:55:09.406 line:15% 
I like it here in the summer, it's hot,

1121
00:55:09.406 --> 00:55:14.406 line:15% 
but it's a quiet, easy, easy rhythm.

1122
00:55:14.537 --> 00:55:16.008 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>So you're slotting into</v>

1123
00:55:16.008 --> 00:55:18.344 line:15% 
a comfortable rhythm here.

1124
00:55:18.344 --> 00:55:21.085 line:15% 
When we're quantum jumping,

1125
00:55:21.085 --> 00:55:22.760 line:15% 
just take us into a little,

1126
00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:24.339 line:15% 
because we've only got a few minutes left.

1127
00:55:24.339 --> 00:55:25.683 line:15% 
I've had so much fun talking with you,

1128
00:55:25.683 --> 00:55:28.498 line:15% 
I forgot to ask you some of the other questions.

1129
00:55:28.498 --> 00:55:33.498 line:15% 
Let's go into, now, the practical application

1130
00:55:34.023 --> 00:55:36.946 line:15% 
of quantum jumping, and what a person

1131
00:55:36.946 --> 00:55:38.962 line:15% 
would expect out of that.

1132
00:55:40.652 --> 00:55:45.265 line:15% 
<v ->The practical is that you attempt things</v>

1133
00:55:45.265 --> 00:55:48.230 line:15% 
that you would not ordinarily do.

1134
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:49.926 line:15% 
You're motivated to do things

1135
00:55:49.926 --> 00:55:52.529 line:15% 
that you would not ordinarily do.

1136
00:55:52.529 --> 00:55:56.731 line:15% 
I talk about art, but not everybody's interested in art.

1137
00:55:56.731 --> 00:55:59.238 line:15% 
I wasn't, but I am now, of course.

1138
00:55:59.238 --> 00:56:01.403 line:15% 
You may be,

1139
00:56:01.403 --> 00:56:05.947 line:15% 
you may want to get out of what you're doing.

1140
00:56:05.947 --> 00:56:10.714 line:15% 
You may be working for someone else, let's say,

1141
00:56:10.714 --> 00:56:13.680 line:15% 
as an employee, and you want to be an employer.

1142
00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:15.002 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Also, right now, a lot of people</v>

1143
00:56:15.002 --> 00:56:17.114 line:15% 
have lost their jobs, so let's just say you want to,

1144
00:56:17.114 --> 00:56:19.556 line:15% 
this is your opportunity, you're unemployed, maybe,

1145
00:56:19.556 --> 00:56:21.370 line:15% 
you have a chance to shift your life,

1146
00:56:21.370 --> 00:56:23.482 line:15% 
and choose to do something that might be

1147
00:56:23.482 --> 00:56:25.433 line:15% 
more in harmony with what you truly are.

1148
00:56:25.433 --> 00:56:29.892 line:15% 
<v ->Exactly, this takes, you might say,</v>

1149
00:56:29.892 --> 00:56:31.769 line:15% 
takes the limitations away from you.

1150
00:56:31.769 --> 00:56:35.108 line:15% 
Most people feel limited in some area of their lives.

1151
00:56:35.108 --> 00:56:37.454 line:15% 
I'm a good example of that:

1152
00:56:37.454 --> 00:56:40.846 line:15% 
I started a whole new field at age,

1153
00:56:40.846 --> 00:56:44.558 line:15% 
when I was 80, I decided to go into the internet.

1154
00:56:46.068 --> 00:56:48.611 line:15% 
Now, 80 is not a time to learn the internet.

1155
00:56:48.611 --> 00:56:50.701 line:15% 
This is a kids' thing.

1156
00:56:50.701 --> 00:56:53.208 line:15% 
You've got to be eight, maybe, to start.

1157
00:56:53.208 --> 00:56:56.088 line:15% 
No, I know quite a bit about the internet now,

1158
00:56:56.088 --> 00:56:57.922 line:15% 
as a matter of fact, the next thing I'll be working on

1159
00:56:57.922 --> 00:57:02.050 line:15% 
is a new app for the iPad and the iPhone.

1160
00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:04.375 line:15% 
That's my next project.

1161
00:57:04.375 --> 00:57:06.690 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>This is coming from your doppelgänger?</v>

1162
00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:09.292 line:15% 
<v ->All this is coming from getting the rhythm</v>

1163
00:57:09.292 --> 00:57:11.319 line:15% 
of somebody who's already doing this.

1164
00:57:11.319 --> 00:57:14.796 line:15% 
Because my doppelgänger is an app expert.

1165
00:57:14.796 --> 00:57:15.820 line:15% 
(laughter)

1166
00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:17.537 line:15% 
And an internet expert.

1167
00:57:17.537 --> 00:57:21.526 line:15% 
I also have other people working with me,

1168
00:57:21.526 --> 00:57:25.504 line:15% 
because once you get the motivation to do things,

1169
00:57:25.504 --> 00:57:28.587 line:15% 
you find different avenues to different roads

1170
00:57:28.587 --> 00:57:30.837 line:15% 
to get to the goal that you're looking for.

1171
00:57:30.837 --> 00:57:32.213 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>So essentially,</v>

1172
00:57:32.213 --> 00:57:34.741 line:15% 
what the quantum jumping does,

1173
00:57:34.741 --> 00:57:37.440 line:15% 
what I'm hearing you say is, A number one,

1174
00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:40.383 line:15% 
you can move past former limitations.

1175
00:57:40.383 --> 00:57:45.215 line:15% 
And you can truly, in a very practical, simple way,

1176
00:57:45.215 --> 00:57:47.487 line:15% 
start employing these techniques?

1177
00:57:47.487 --> 00:57:52.223 line:15% 
<v ->You can start employing the techniques immediately.</v>

1178
00:57:52.223 --> 00:57:53.343 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Immediately.</v>

1179
00:57:53.343 --> 00:57:55.454 line:15% 
<v ->This is not something that you work at for</v>

1180
00:57:55.454 --> 00:57:56.958 line:15% 
<v Burt>ten years.</v>
<v Voiceover>That's good.</v>

1181
00:57:56.958 --> 00:57:59.102 line:15% 
<v ->Not that you can't work at it for ten years,</v>

1182
00:57:59.102 --> 00:58:01.929 line:15% 
you continually improve.

1183
00:58:01.929 --> 00:58:02.835 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>What's it do to the,</v>

1184
00:58:02.835 --> 00:58:04.787 line:15% 
just the sheer fun factor of your life?

1185
00:58:04.787 --> 00:58:08.616 line:15% 
To just know that you're not a limited human being anymore

1186
00:58:08.616 --> 00:58:10.270 line:15% 
in your own mind?

1187
00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:13.587 line:15% 
<v ->It opens up everything for you.</v>

1188
00:58:13.587 --> 00:58:15.976 line:15% 
But, then again, you discover that

1189
00:58:15.976 --> 00:58:18.696 line:15% 
you're not interested in the things you formerly loved.

1190
00:58:18.696 --> 00:58:20.317 line:15% 
I live at a golf course.

1191
00:58:20.317 --> 00:58:23.175 line:15% 
There's the first tee out that window over there.

1192
00:58:23.175 --> 00:58:25.287 line:15% 
I haven't played golf in two years.

1193
00:58:25.287 --> 00:58:26.589 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Because you're a painter.</v>

1194
00:58:26.589 --> 00:58:29.191 line:15% 
<v ->It's not that, golf takes five hours.</v>

1195
00:58:29.191 --> 00:58:30.887 line:15% 
I don't have five hours to spare!

1196
00:58:30.887 --> 00:58:32.732 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>You're working too hard!</v>

1197
00:58:32.732 --> 00:58:34.801 line:15% 
<v ->I want to put it into something else.</v>

1198
00:58:34.801 --> 00:58:36.380 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>All I can say, Burt,</v>

1199
00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:39.420 line:15% 
is that you are a living, breathing example

1200
00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:42.246 line:15% 
of your discoveries throughout your lifetime.

1201
00:58:42.246 --> 00:58:44.849 line:15% 
I mean, here you are, people watching are going to say,

1202
00:58:44.849 --> 00:58:47.590 line:15% 
"Come on, what product does he use on his hair?"

1203
00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:49.776 line:15% 
That's your real hair, this is your real skin,

1204
00:58:49.776 --> 00:58:52.486 line:15% 
this is your real life, you're 82 years old,

1205
00:58:52.486 --> 00:58:54.768 line:15% 
and you have the energy, inventiveness,

1206
00:58:54.768 --> 00:58:58.640 line:15% 
creativity and fun of somebody a quarter your age.

1207
00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:02.704 line:15% 
<v ->And I'm looking forward to 2011 and 2012</v>

1208
00:59:02.704 --> 00:59:04.421 line:15% 
when I'm going to come up with some new stuff.

1209
00:59:04.421 --> 00:59:05.370 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>There you go.</v>

1210
00:59:05.370 --> 00:59:07.951 line:15% 
Well, I have not taken the course, yet,

1211
00:59:07.951 --> 00:59:10.415 line:15% 
so I actually can't wait to give it a try.

1212
00:59:10.415 --> 00:59:13.583 line:15%
