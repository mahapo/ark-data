00:00:00.426 --> 00:00:02.384
<v ->Have you ever sustained a shock in your life</v>

2
00:00:02.384 --> 00:00:04.570
from which you feel you never fully recovered?

3
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.914
Perhaps a car accident,

4
00:00:05.914 --> 00:00:07.653
the death of a friend or a pet,

5
00:00:07.653 --> 00:00:09.284
or a serious injury.

6
00:00:09.284 --> 00:00:12.303
Jill Kuykendall's life work is helping people recover

7
00:00:12.303 --> 00:00:14.041
those lost parts of themselves

8
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:17.039
with an ancient practice called soul retrieval.

9
00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.406
In her former career, she was a physical therapist

10
00:00:19.406 --> 00:00:21.284
who worked with the most fragile of us,

11
00:00:21.284 --> 00:00:23.396
people getting out of bed for the first time

12
00:00:23.396 --> 00:00:25.347
after surgery or an accident.

13
00:00:25.347 --> 00:00:27.811
One day her life changed when she began seeing

14
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:30.288
another force surrounding them.

15
00:00:30.288 --> 00:00:34.030
Today she facilitates one beautiful reunion after another.

16
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.797
Let's start at the beginning of your discovery

17
00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:48.994
of the whole soul retrieval process,

18
00:00:48.994 --> 00:00:52.834
going back to the times when you were a physical therapist.

19
00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:55.576
What is the chronology of events that occurred

20
00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:57.399
that brought you to where you are now?

21
00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.492
<v ->I sometimes describe that as walking backwards</v>

22
00:01:00.492 --> 00:01:03.116
through the back door of this work

23
00:01:03.116 --> 00:01:05.354
in that I was very busy.

24
00:01:05.354 --> 00:01:07.421
I was working full time as an

25
00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:09.065
in hospital physical therapist,

26
00:01:09.065 --> 00:01:10.497
so I was working with a lot of people

27
00:01:10.497 --> 00:01:13.408
in critical care situations,

28
00:01:13.408 --> 00:01:17.280
and being that it was very scientific

29
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.157
and I was responsible for a lot

30
00:01:19.157 --> 00:01:22.550
of data feedback on how patients are,

31
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.426
I wasn't really thinking about these things,

32
00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:28.767
and yet long ago during an internship in physical therapy,

33
00:01:28.767 --> 00:01:31.846
I was lucky enough to work with a European therapist

34
00:01:31.846 --> 00:01:34.644
who oriented me towards understanding the

35
00:01:34.644 --> 00:01:37.899
more personal or trans-personal aspects

36
00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.637
of a person as they're recovering,

37
00:01:40.637 --> 00:01:42.407
and it led me enough to understand

38
00:01:42.407 --> 00:01:45.496
that the state of the soul is often revealed

39
00:01:45.496 --> 00:01:49.277
by the breath and by their ability

40
00:01:49.277 --> 00:01:53.735
to experience joy and happiness even during trying times,

41
00:01:53.735 --> 00:01:56.277
so she really bridged me into knowing

42
00:01:56.277 --> 00:01:59.503
that that's something I should take with me wherever I work,

43
00:01:59.503 --> 00:02:03.207
so I'm working in a hospital, ICUs.

44
00:02:03.207 --> 00:02:06.599
Intensive Care Units were places I spent a lot of time,

45
00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:09.830
as well as being called upon by medical staff

46
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.908
to come and help somebody get out of bed for the first time

47
00:02:12.908 --> 00:02:17.202
after a major surgery or being in bed in a prolonged way,

48
00:02:17.202 --> 00:02:18.933
or even after a major accident.

49
00:02:18.933 --> 00:02:21.360
That's why people are in the hospital.

50
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.817
And getting out of bed is something I take for granted,

51
00:02:23.817 --> 00:02:27.757
and yet in that moment in which you really can't do it,

52
00:02:27.757 --> 00:02:29.927
it is helpful to have somebody there

53
00:02:29.927 --> 00:02:33.156
who will deal with IV lines and oxygen

54
00:02:33.156 --> 00:02:36.473
and all of these things that make it more nerve-racking.

55
00:02:36.473 --> 00:02:39.076
So I would be called in as one of many therapists

56
00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:42.522
to assist this person to come to the edge of the bed,

57
00:02:42.522 --> 00:02:45.755
stand up, get their bearings, take a few steps,

58
00:02:45.755 --> 00:02:47.556
and then generally stay up in a chair

59
00:02:47.556 --> 00:02:49.287
for maybe just fifteen minutes.

60
00:02:49.287 --> 00:02:51.024
This is how you get started.

61
00:02:51.024 --> 00:02:53.945
Getting out of that bed is your way of going home.

62
00:02:53.945 --> 00:02:57.411
I would walk in and had very little time.

63
00:02:57.411 --> 00:03:01.217
I had 22 minutes to review a chart,

64
00:03:01.217 --> 00:03:04.662
talk to a nurse, get in, establish trust,

65
00:03:04.662 --> 00:03:07.949
set the situation up, assist the patient, get it done,

66
00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:10.435
and then basically get back to that chart and chart it,

67
00:03:10.435 --> 00:03:12.233
and then I'm on to the next patient.

68
00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:13.520
<v Voiceover>22 minutes?</v>
<v ->22 minutes.</v>

69
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.174
<v Voiceover>Seven minutes to accomplish the first part,</v>

70
00:03:15.174 --> 00:03:17.003
15 to get them to set up, and then one minute

71
00:03:17.003 --> 00:03:18.530
to chart it, and out you go.
<v ->Right.</v>

72
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.213
<v Voiceover>Wow.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

73
00:03:20.213 --> 00:03:23.388
The whole time, establishing real genuine trust

74
00:03:23.388 --> 00:03:25.214
in connection with this person.

75
00:03:25.214 --> 00:03:26.817
<v Voiceover>That was the first seven minutes.</v>

76
00:03:26.817 --> 00:03:27.911
(both laugh)

77
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:29.964
<v ->I would find that I would walk in,</v>

78
00:03:29.964 --> 00:03:32.864
and my natural tendency was

79
00:03:32.864 --> 00:03:35.904
to basically honor them

80
00:03:35.904 --> 00:03:38.948
and introduce myself and call them by name

81
00:03:38.948 --> 00:03:41.550
and let them know that they're in the middle of this event

82
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.897
and yet the doctor has declared it time

83
00:03:43.897 --> 00:03:46.638
for them to get out of bed and start moving,

84
00:03:46.638 --> 00:03:50.667
and many of them, the bed had become the safe zone.

85
00:03:51.387 --> 00:03:54.947
This is asking a lot of them, to leave the safe zone.

86
00:03:54.947 --> 00:03:56.824
Said, "We're gonna take it one step at a time,

87
00:03:56.824 --> 00:03:58.338
"and any time you need to break it up,

88
00:03:58.338 --> 00:03:59.548
"we'll break it up, and we'll only go

89
00:03:59.548 --> 00:04:01.716
"as far as you can and what you say."

90
00:04:01.716 --> 00:04:04.667
I started to emphasize "what you're ready for".

91
00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:06.690
"We'll do what you're truly ready for,

92
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.568
"but we don't even know what that is until we try."

93
00:04:09.568 --> 00:04:11.500
There were times where it was very slow,

94
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.010
just rolling to the side,

95
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.707
getting them to sit up on the side of the bed,

96
00:04:14.707 --> 00:04:16.406
and that's usually a time when things

97
00:04:16.406 --> 00:04:18.635
like blood pressure will woo, take a dive.

98
00:04:18.635 --> 00:04:20.960
So I always knew to have them stop there

99
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.781
while everything came back,

100
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:24.446
and I could see all the monitors.

101
00:04:24.446 --> 00:04:26.506
I could see that heart rate, blood pressure,

102
00:04:26.506 --> 00:04:29.325
oxygen saturation, everything had to maintain

103
00:04:29.325 --> 00:04:32.216
in order to take the next step.

104
00:04:32.216 --> 00:04:34.489
Here they are sitting on the side of the bed.

105
00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:37.407
Sometimes I'd be standing next to them with a hand on them.

106
00:04:37.407 --> 00:04:39.256
Sometimes they'd have me sit next to them,

107
00:04:39.256 --> 00:04:41.112
give them a little more support,

108
00:04:41.112 --> 00:04:44.756
and I've done this, you know, day after day for years,

109
00:04:44.756 --> 00:04:47.842
and all of a sudden, that one particular day,

110
00:04:47.842 --> 00:04:50.879
I see something going on in the room.

111
00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.935
It's like hot air above asphalt, you know.

112
00:04:53.935 --> 00:04:55.174
I mean, it was like, "What?"

113
00:04:55.174 --> 00:04:56.838
I'm thinking the lights, something in the hallway.

114
00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:58.359
<v Voiceover>Like that wavy kind of pattern?</v>

115
00:04:58.359 --> 00:04:59.610
<v ->That wavy thing.
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

116
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.049
<v ->But it was more subtle than the intense heat off asphalt,</v>

117
00:05:02.049 --> 00:05:04.332
so I'm looking in the hall to see

118
00:05:04.332 --> 00:05:05.772
if something's reflecting out,

119
00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:08.236
and I then assume that it's me.

120
00:05:08.236 --> 00:05:10.828
Burn out is happening right before ... (both laugh)

121
00:05:10.828 --> 00:05:12.363
<v Voiceover>Hallucinations!</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

122
00:05:12.363 --> 00:05:15.851
And yet I noticed that it started to shift and change

123
00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:18.744
and coalesce around this individual

124
00:05:18.744 --> 00:05:21.148
and then literally merge with him,

125
00:05:21.148 --> 00:05:23.908
and this just took my breath away

126
00:05:23.908 --> 00:05:26.756
except I was in the middle of being of service to somebody,

127
00:05:26.756 --> 00:05:29.316
so I thought, "This is not the time for me

128
00:05:29.316 --> 00:05:31.099
"to try and figure this out."

129
00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:32.910
And you know, inevitably, within a minute or two

130
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.935
of this person saying, "I'm too anxious. I can't do this."

131
00:05:36.935 --> 00:05:38.734
You know, "I'm not ready."

132
00:05:38.734 --> 00:05:40.837
There would be this deep sigh,

133
00:05:40.837 --> 00:05:43.886
and they'd say, "You know, I think I can do this."

134
00:05:43.886 --> 00:05:45.187
<v Voiceover>Hm.</v>

135
00:05:45.187 --> 00:05:47.663
That's how it began, and what I was seeing,

136
00:05:47.663 --> 00:05:50.850
without even trying to develop this ability,

137
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.277
was I was seeing an aspect of this person's life essence

138
00:05:55.277 --> 00:05:58.552
that had separated from them but had not dissociated.

139
00:05:58.552 --> 00:06:00.920
It had stayed relatively close,

140
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.402
and given the right opportunity

141
00:06:03.402 --> 00:06:05.933
to make a very life-affirming gesture,

142
00:06:05.933 --> 00:06:08.397
from going from the horizontal to the vertical

143
00:06:08.397 --> 00:06:10.924
in a way in which they're being honored,

144
00:06:10.924 --> 00:06:12.860
encouraged to be more powerful,

145
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.643
there's a little harmony being restored there.

146
00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:20.257
It came back to them, as it should.

147
00:06:20.257 --> 00:06:22.145
It's not meant to be missing.

148
00:06:22.145 --> 00:06:23.585
It's an adaptive mechanism

149
00:06:23.585 --> 00:06:25.643
when a portion of our life essence leaves

150
00:06:25.643 --> 00:06:28.662
in order to narrow us down so we can simply cope,

151
00:06:28.662 --> 00:06:30.825
and in some cases, survive.

152
00:06:30.825 --> 00:06:33.261
Hospitals are a pretty intense environment,

153
00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:35.712
and we go through a lot of experiences there

154
00:06:35.712 --> 00:06:38.260
that are challenging to our life essence,

155
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.845
so I had no clue though, when I first saw this,

156
00:06:41.845 --> 00:06:44.395
and then I started to see it with other people,

157
00:06:44.395 --> 00:06:47.562
and as I would use my own time

158
00:06:47.562 --> 00:06:49.578
to call up friends who did energy work,

159
00:06:49.578 --> 00:06:51.253
I'd say, "This is what I'm observing.

160
00:06:51.253 --> 00:06:52.383
"What do you think it is?"

161
00:06:52.383 --> 00:06:54.218
They were somewhat descriptive,

162
00:06:54.218 --> 00:06:57.775
but it wasn't until my husband Hank Wesselman walks

163
00:06:57.775 --> 00:06:59.305
by as I'm on the phone,

164
00:06:59.305 --> 00:07:01.759
overhears a bit of what I'm talking about,

165
00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:03.413
and then indicates to me

166
00:07:03.413 --> 00:07:05.889
that he thinks he knows what's going on.

167
00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:07.670
As an anthropologist and someone

168
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.835
who's done some shamanic work training,

169
00:07:09.835 --> 00:07:12.267
he said, "I think you are facilitating a kind

170
00:07:12.267 --> 00:07:15.187
"of spontaneous return of this life essence,

171
00:07:15.187 --> 00:07:18.087
"and it's now referred to as soul retrieval."

172
00:07:18.607 --> 00:07:20.493
And I thought, "My goodness."

173
00:07:20.493 --> 00:07:23.587
This goes right back to my original understanding,

174
00:07:23.587 --> 00:07:26.403
side by side with medicine from this European therapist

175
00:07:26.403 --> 00:07:28.974
who said, "The soul's reality will always be showing

176
00:07:28.974 --> 00:07:31.021
"up when you work with people."

177
00:07:31.021 --> 00:07:32.248
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm.</v>

178
00:07:32.248 --> 00:07:35.032
<v ->So I said, "Let's see what this means."</v>

179
00:07:35.032 --> 00:07:37.009
I got into some of the literature,

180
00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:39.068
ethnographic literature as well as

181
00:07:39.068 --> 00:07:40.690
some of the things that had been written

182
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.255
like Sandra Ingerman's book on soul retrieval,

183
00:07:43.255 --> 00:07:44.930
and I said, "Well, my goodness.

184
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.190
"I know how to shamanicly journey.

185
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.626
"Maybe those situations where the readiness is there

186
00:07:50.626 --> 00:07:52.663
"but the dissociation has occurred,

187
00:07:52.663 --> 00:07:54.753
"maybe I can use my journey skills

188
00:07:54.753 --> 00:07:56.844
"to go and connect with aspects

189
00:07:56.844 --> 00:07:59.841
"of a person's life essence and bridge it back."

190
00:07:59.841 --> 00:08:01.633
So it started very slowly.

191
00:08:01.633 --> 00:08:03.862
It was about six months of observation in the hospital,

192
00:08:03.862 --> 00:08:06.315
some conversation, reading about it,

193
00:08:06.315 --> 00:08:07.414
learning more about it,

194
00:08:07.414 --> 00:08:09.035
and I would say within a year's period of time,

195
00:08:09.035 --> 00:08:11.840
I had shifted enough to turn to a few friends

196
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.867
and say, "You know, I can journey on your behalf

197
00:08:14.867 --> 00:08:16.368
"to see if I can help you with something

198
00:08:16.368 --> 00:08:18.765
"that you've been missing."

199
00:08:18.765 --> 00:08:21.735
They all were very happy for me to do that,

200
00:08:21.735 --> 00:08:23.508
and I figured, "Well, that was interesting.

201
00:08:23.508 --> 00:08:26.057
"Now what else can I pay attention to?"

202
00:08:26.057 --> 00:08:28.660
Well then they started sharing,

203
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.964
and phone calls started to come in

204
00:08:30.964 --> 00:08:32.521
of people I had never even met.

205
00:08:32.521 --> 00:08:35.037
"Would you be willing to journey on my behalf?"

206
00:08:35.037 --> 00:08:38.178
And I thought, "Well, okay."

207
00:08:38.178 --> 00:08:40.173
I figured, "How long could this last?

208
00:08:40.173 --> 00:08:41.357
"Maybe six months?"

209
00:08:41.357 --> 00:08:44.194
By then I had moved into my own consulting work

210
00:08:44.194 --> 00:08:45.815
in terms of independent living,

211
00:08:45.815 --> 00:08:48.549
especially for elders in the Sacramento area,

212
00:08:48.549 --> 00:08:50.860
and before I knew it there were more calls

213
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.652
for me to do soul retrieval journeys

214
00:08:52.652 --> 00:08:55.297
than there was to do home visits and so forth,

215
00:08:55.297 --> 00:08:57.292
and I stepped back and I said,

216
00:08:57.292 --> 00:08:59.777
"20 years of working in rehab has taught me so much,

217
00:08:59.777 --> 00:09:01.477
"and it's brought me to this point.

218
00:09:01.477 --> 00:09:02.894
"What do I do?"

219
00:09:02.894 --> 00:09:05.156
And my own inner guidance and my own journey work

220
00:09:05.156 --> 00:09:09.077
to discover what I am being led into said,

221
00:09:09.077 --> 00:09:12.362
"Let go of the rehab. Open yourself to this."

222
00:09:12.362 --> 00:09:16.799
And as long as people ask, I'll be of service.

223
00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:19.103
<v Voiceover>It's such a beautiful</v>

224
00:09:19.103 --> 00:09:21.324
and really organic story

225
00:09:21.324 --> 00:09:22.888
of your beginnings,
<v ->Yeah. (laughs)</v>

226
00:09:22.888 --> 00:09:24.325
and how wonderful that Hank was there

227
00:09:24.325 --> 00:09:26.057
to basically guide you and say,

228
00:09:26.057 --> 00:09:27.547
"Hey, this is what's going on."

229
00:09:27.547 --> 00:09:29.432
to refine your process.

230
00:09:29.432 --> 00:09:31.822
Let's get into it now.

231
00:09:31.822 --> 00:09:34.075
Now, so this is what you do,

232
00:09:34.075 --> 00:09:36.496
and you help people guide portions of their soul

233
00:09:36.496 --> 00:09:38.534
back to themselves.
<v ->Right.</v>

234
00:09:38.534 --> 00:09:40.976
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about how we</v>

235
00:09:40.976 --> 00:09:43.995
become disassociated from pieces or portions

236
00:09:43.995 --> 00:09:46.480
of the soul force to begin with.

237
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.247
<v ->Yeah, well, I'll define this life essence or the soul</v>

238
00:09:51.247 --> 00:09:53.477
in just very pragmatic terms.

239
00:09:53.477 --> 00:09:55.983
I do not create, first, a religious overlay about it,

240
00:09:55.983 --> 00:09:59.098
but it's the energetic portion of you

241
00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:02.052
that's very much oriented towards your wellness

242
00:10:02.052 --> 00:10:06.318
and being alive, and yet it has a certain imprint

243
00:10:06.318 --> 00:10:08.196
on it that's specific to you,

244
00:10:08.196 --> 00:10:11.528
and it has to do with your own personal,

245
00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:14.979
supernatural nature that's imbuing this life force.

246
00:10:14.979 --> 00:10:17.496
In other words, there's one very specific to you,

247
00:10:17.496 --> 00:10:20.675
very specific to me, and mine can only serve me.

248
00:10:20.675 --> 00:10:22.691
It can't really serve you.

249
00:10:22.691 --> 00:10:26.104
So when I talk about a person's life essence,

250
00:10:26.104 --> 00:10:29.058
I'm talking about that energetic field

251
00:10:29.058 --> 00:10:30.914
that's really their thumbprint,

252
00:10:30.914 --> 00:10:33.442
and when they have experiences

253
00:10:33.442 --> 00:10:37.293
which are in any way considered traumatic and overwhelming,

254
00:10:37.293 --> 00:10:39.340
whether it's outwardly evident,

255
00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.292
or maybe it's an inward process

256
00:10:41.292 --> 00:10:43.980
where it's their own perceptual experience

257
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.569
that something traumatic is happening

258
00:10:45.569 --> 00:10:48.588
although nobody else would perceive it in the moment,

259
00:10:48.588 --> 00:10:51.638
you can in fact precipitate your own soul loss

260
00:10:51.638 --> 00:10:53.654
because now you have something you need to cope with,

261
00:10:53.654 --> 00:10:55.446
based on your own perceptions.

262
00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:57.537
And a part of that essence,

263
00:10:57.537 --> 00:11:00.224
which is really oriented to being connected,

264
00:11:00.224 --> 00:11:01.824
will step out.

265
00:11:01.824 --> 00:11:04.267
It will actually achieve a separate state

266
00:11:04.267 --> 00:11:08.277
to bring you down into a narrowed place in order to cope.

267
00:11:08.277 --> 00:11:11.189
This is a good thing. This is an adaptive mechanism.

268
00:11:11.189 --> 00:11:12.618
<v Voiceover>It's kind of like the body kicking in</v>

269
00:11:12.618 --> 00:11:14.314
only the survival mechanisms.

270
00:11:14.314 --> 00:11:15.733
<v ->It is.
<v Voiceover>Mmhmm.</v>

271
00:11:15.733 --> 00:11:16.874
<v ->Just like if you were to cut yourself,</v>

272
00:11:16.874 --> 00:11:18.197
you have a clotting factor.

273
00:11:18.197 --> 00:11:20.074
<v Voiceover>Right, and all your energy goes there.</v>

274
00:11:20.074 --> 00:11:23.579
<v ->Yeah, this is an adaptive mecha-, so it's ...</v>

275
00:11:23.579 --> 00:11:25.131
When people go, "Soul loss is terrible."

276
00:11:25.131 --> 00:11:26.743
I go, "No, it's not." (laughs)

277
00:11:26.743 --> 00:11:28.546
<v Voiceover>It's an adaptation to help, yeah.</v>

278
00:11:28.546 --> 00:11:31.766
<v ->Ultimately, it's not, but we've just unfortunately,</v>

279
00:11:31.766 --> 00:11:35.511
are dealing with times in which it no longer stays close.

280
00:11:35.511 --> 00:11:38.487
What I'm talking about is the rhythm is that it leaves

281
00:11:38.487 --> 00:11:40.791
and it narrows you down to cope

282
00:11:40.791 --> 00:11:44.566
with the idea that the rhythm is the trauma has passed.

283
00:11:44.566 --> 00:11:48.865
Now it's time to return to a more harmonious state.

284
00:11:48.865 --> 00:11:50.795
You're going to, you know,

285
00:11:50.795 --> 00:11:53.142
and I'm thinking of an example of somebody

286
00:11:53.142 --> 00:11:56.843
who had soul loss as a child that was a combination

287
00:11:56.843 --> 00:11:59.392
of falling off the top of a jungle gym,

288
00:11:59.392 --> 00:12:02.368
hitting the ground just as the school,

289
00:12:02.368 --> 00:12:05.920
the recess bell rang, and air knocked out,

290
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.266
all the kids are running away,

291
00:12:08.266 --> 00:12:11.605
and unable to move, get up, scream, or anything.

292
00:12:11.605 --> 00:12:14.242
<v Voiceover>Oh, wow, a convergence of a lot</v>

293
00:12:14.242 --> 00:12:16.120
of events in one moment.
<v ->Exactly.</v>

294
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.935
In this child's mind, they thought they were dying,

295
00:12:18.935 --> 00:12:21.068
and nobody was going to help them.

296
00:12:21.068 --> 00:12:23.264
A few minutes later the teacher did come

297
00:12:23.264 --> 00:12:26.507
and assist getting the child back in the classroom

298
00:12:26.507 --> 00:12:27.990
and was sensitive enough to say,

299
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.731
"I know where a nice, quiet place would be for you

300
00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:33.238
"just to kind of gather yourself."

301
00:12:33.238 --> 00:12:37.515
And set up a little chair in the little coat collection area

302
00:12:37.515 --> 00:12:39.648
where all the lunch boxes, (both laugh)

303
00:12:39.648 --> 00:12:41.696
and let that child collect herself

304
00:12:41.696 --> 00:12:44.042
and then at her own pace come back

305
00:12:44.042 --> 00:12:46.218
to her desk and join in,

306
00:12:46.218 --> 00:12:48.885
and at the end of the day,

307
00:12:48.885 --> 00:12:52.724
went home, surrounded herself with her precious things,

308
00:12:52.724 --> 00:12:54.388
you know, her stuffed animals,

309
00:12:54.388 --> 00:12:56.511
maintained kind of a quiet day.

310
00:12:56.511 --> 00:12:58.825
The mother was informed of what had happened

311
00:12:58.825 --> 00:13:01.407
and everything seemed to be fine physically.

312
00:13:01.407 --> 00:13:03.753
Then of course went to sleep that night,

313
00:13:03.753 --> 00:13:05.844
and throughout the rest of the day,

314
00:13:05.844 --> 00:13:07.113
there were these little touches

315
00:13:07.113 --> 00:13:09.802
in which there was a re-harmonizing that went on.

316
00:13:09.802 --> 00:13:12.472
Whatever she needed to do to restore herself,

317
00:13:12.472 --> 00:13:15.255
and then of course the sleeping at night is a time

318
00:13:15.255 --> 00:13:17.623
in which there's a lot of body restoration,

319
00:13:17.623 --> 00:13:21.089
and as I understand, there's a lot of soul return,

320
00:13:21.089 --> 00:13:24.342
based on those soul parts that haven't left.

321
00:13:24.342 --> 00:13:26.657
Now too often, we have experiences

322
00:13:26.657 --> 00:13:29.025
in which we just have to keep going

323
00:13:29.025 --> 00:13:30.816
and things are not re-harmonized.

324
00:13:30.816 --> 00:13:33.318
Maybe that what precipitated the soul loss

325
00:13:33.318 --> 00:13:34.852
is a chronic thing.

326
00:13:34.852 --> 00:13:35.867
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

327
00:13:35.867 --> 00:13:37.188
<v ->And that soul part cannot get back.</v>

328
00:13:37.188 --> 00:13:38.275
It cannot get back.

329
00:13:38.275 --> 00:13:40.652
It cannot because of the agitated state,

330
00:13:40.652 --> 00:13:44.074
or the shift in the energetic state of that life essence,

331
00:13:44.074 --> 00:13:47.049
and so it dissociates.

332
00:13:47.049 --> 00:13:49.534
Now this is where I ask my psychology friends,

333
00:13:49.534 --> 00:13:51.849
"Where does it dissociate?"

334
00:13:51.849 --> 00:13:53.961
And it's not within their field to operate

335
00:13:53.961 --> 00:13:57.097
with that kind of consideration.

336
00:13:57.097 --> 00:13:58.281
<v Voiceover>Sure.</v>

337
00:13:58.281 --> 00:14:00.392
<v ->But when you go back into the ethnographic literature,</v>

338
00:14:00.392 --> 00:14:03.638
you'll realize that consistently around the world,

339
00:14:03.638 --> 00:14:06.013
the shamans that were the healers

340
00:14:06.013 --> 00:14:09.714
for tribes and groups of people actually did understand

341
00:14:09.714 --> 00:14:12.445
that there is this other level of reality

342
00:14:12.445 --> 00:14:14.653
that they simply slip into

343
00:14:14.653 --> 00:14:16.647
that's outside our time and space,

344
00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:21.042
and it has it's own cosmological, geographical locations,

345
00:14:21.042 --> 00:14:23.132
which again are consistently agreed upon,

346
00:14:23.132 --> 00:14:25.617
and these soul parts,

347
00:14:25.617 --> 00:14:27.569
these pieces of a person's life essence,

348
00:14:27.569 --> 00:14:31.100
will actually end up in one of these locations.

349
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.785
<v Voiceover>I wanted to ask a couple questions</v>

350
00:14:32.785 --> 00:14:35.460
at this point, before we go further.

351
00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.056
How does, you're talking about the unique thumbprint

352
00:14:39.056 --> 00:14:41.285
that is us energetically that surrounds the body.

353
00:14:41.285 --> 00:14:43.418
How does this differ from, or does it differ from,

354
00:14:43.418 --> 00:14:46.795
the more extended view of the auric field?

355
00:14:48.065 --> 00:14:50.020
<v ->Well, I'm not sure that I know</v>

356
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:52.271
what the extended view of the auric field is. (laughs)

357
00:14:52.271 --> 00:14:53.860
<v Voiceover>Well, I mean all the subtle bodies.</v>

358
00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.204
For example, all the subtle bodies

359
00:14:55.204 --> 00:14:58.169
that would constitute one's individual auric field,

360
00:14:58.169 --> 00:15:00.494
with all of the carried forward information

361
00:15:00.494 --> 00:15:03.187
that lies in our unique thumbprint.

362
00:15:03.187 --> 00:15:05.752
<v ->Right. I guess I should really call it a breath-print.</v>

363
00:15:05.752 --> 00:15:06.488
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

364
00:15:06.488 --> 00:15:07.886
<v ->Because it's the part of the soul,</v>

365
00:15:07.886 --> 00:15:11.000
the immortal part of our soul that really seeds itself

366
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.507
when we take in our first breath when we're born.

367
00:15:13.507 --> 00:15:14.999
<v Voiceover>Okay, okay.</v>

368
00:15:14.999 --> 00:15:17.592
<v ->However that translates then into the aura,</v>

369
00:15:17.592 --> 00:15:20.941
or the developing aura, somebody else can speak about that,

370
00:15:20.941 --> 00:15:24.589
but there is an aspect of our soul that's immortal,

371
00:15:24.589 --> 00:15:27.511
and through my own observations,

372
00:15:27.511 --> 00:15:29.666
and then again going back into the literature,

373
00:15:29.666 --> 00:15:31.319
low and behold,

374
00:15:31.319 --> 00:15:34.807
it seems as if the indigenous people have understood

375
00:15:34.807 --> 00:15:37.793
for a long time that our soul is not a singularity.

376
00:15:37.793 --> 00:15:40.769
It's actually a composite, to keep it simple,

377
00:15:40.769 --> 00:15:43.318
of three souls that comes together

378
00:15:43.318 --> 00:15:46.251
to constitute the entirety of the soul.

379
00:15:46.251 --> 00:15:49.035
One of those souls is our immortal soul,

380
00:15:49.035 --> 00:15:51.616
the other two are generated through the mortal life

381
00:15:51.616 --> 00:15:53.301
that we're living at this time,

382
00:15:53.301 --> 00:15:55.979
and so it's that seeding of the immortal soul

383
00:15:55.979 --> 00:15:57.898
that creates that breath-print

384
00:15:57.898 --> 00:16:00.245
into your energetic field that,

385
00:16:00.245 --> 00:16:02.645
in other words, creates your Regina-ness.

386
00:16:02.645 --> 00:16:04.537
<v Voiceover>Mmhmm. (laughs)</v>
<v ->My Jill-ness. (laughs)</v>

387
00:16:04.537 --> 00:16:06.079
<v Voiceover>Jill-ness, right.</v>

388
00:16:06.079 --> 00:16:09.802
<v ->So in that sense, we can claim it.</v>

389
00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:12.560
As part of our birthright, we can claim that

390
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.298
as part of who we are.

391
00:16:14.298 --> 00:16:15.808
<v Regina>Mmhmm, okay.</v>

392
00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:19.400
Is this something that most people experience

393
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.299
within their lifetime, and give us some of the ways

394
00:16:22.299 --> 00:16:25.761
in which this is inspired from childbirth forward.

395
00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:30.240
<v ->Okay, yes, in fact, I think it is part of being human</v>

396
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.256
that we have this experience

397
00:16:32.256 --> 00:16:34.443
such that it is an adaptive mechanism.

398
00:16:34.443 --> 00:16:36.224
It's part of our survival,

399
00:16:36.224 --> 00:16:38.848
and in the past,

400
00:16:38.848 --> 00:16:42.730
in tribal societies it was very common for the wellbeing

401
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.706
of the group to be benefitted by making sure

402
00:16:45.706 --> 00:16:48.373
that people were soulfully intact

403
00:16:48.373 --> 00:16:49.695
and if they had soul loss,

404
00:16:49.695 --> 00:16:51.764
there was definitely something done

405
00:16:51.764 --> 00:16:54.058
at the level of community ceremony

406
00:16:54.058 --> 00:16:56.127
within three days of the soul loss.

407
00:16:56.127 --> 00:16:59.103
Now I hear that given our Western society way of being

408
00:16:59.103 --> 00:17:01.673
in the world, which we tend to have great wounding

409
00:17:01.673 --> 00:17:04.041
from birth on, or even before birth

410
00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:06.643
such that, well, we're always trying

411
00:17:06.643 --> 00:17:09.993
to work that out in therapy many, many years later.

412
00:17:09.993 --> 00:17:14.078
Sometimes it is a matter of just simply allowing the reunion

413
00:17:14.078 --> 00:17:16.140
of the life essence to come back

414
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:19.131
and then live at that level.

415
00:17:19.131 --> 00:17:21.117
<v Regina>Easier said than done?</v>

416
00:17:21.117 --> 00:17:23.219
<v ->Easier said than done, except in children.</v>

417
00:17:23.219 --> 00:17:24.536
<v Regina>Right. (Jill laughs)</v>

418
00:17:24.536 --> 00:17:26.515
Right, they instinctively know
<v ->Right.</v>

419
00:17:26.515 --> 00:17:27.963
<v Regina>when it's time to take a little break</v>

420
00:17:27.963 --> 00:17:29.225
<v ->That's right.
<v Regina>and time to party.</v>

421
00:17:29.225 --> 00:17:30.409
<v ->Exactly.
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

422
00:17:30.409 --> 00:17:32.706
Now for others, I will say that,

423
00:17:32.706 --> 00:17:34.540
I would say the better percentage,

424
00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.205
I don't know the numbers.

425
00:17:37.205 --> 00:17:40.054
I don't sit at outside cafes watching people go by

426
00:17:40.054 --> 00:17:42.326
and going, "Oh my goodness. Oh you better come over here."

427
00:17:42.326 --> 00:17:44.044
I mean, this is not what I do. (both laugh)

428
00:17:44.044 --> 00:17:44.758
<v Regina>Right.</v>

429
00:17:44.758 --> 00:17:47.019
<v ->You know, the standard by which I do</v>

430
00:17:47.019 --> 00:17:48.811
this work is based upon people asking,

431
00:17:48.811 --> 00:17:51.243
so in terms of the people that come to me,

432
00:17:51.243 --> 00:17:53.782
it's 100%. (laughs)
<v Regina>Sure. (laughs)</v>

433
00:17:53.782 --> 00:17:56.352
<v ->But I will say that most people who say,</v>

434
00:17:56.352 --> 00:17:58.475
"You do an interesting work, I hear.

435
00:17:58.475 --> 00:18:00.277
"What is it that you do?"

436
00:18:00.277 --> 00:18:02.602
I have have found it's very beneficial

437
00:18:02.602 --> 00:18:05.525
to respond by asking questions,

438
00:18:05.525 --> 00:18:07.946
by drawing people into their own reflection.

439
00:18:07.946 --> 00:18:10.517
I'll say, "Have you ever had an experience

440
00:18:10.517 --> 00:18:14.516
"in which you feel as if you lost a part of yourself

441
00:18:14.516 --> 00:18:17.750
"and you weren't the same afterwards?"

442
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.391
<v Regina>It can be a death in the family.</v>

443
00:18:19.391 --> 00:18:20.683
It can be a car accident.

444
00:18:20.683 --> 00:18:21.893
<v ->It can be the death of a pet.</v>

445
00:18:21.893 --> 00:18:23.156
<v Regina>I was just going to say</v>

446
00:18:23.156 --> 00:18:25.043
or the death of your little dog or cat.

447
00:18:25.043 --> 00:18:26.574
I experienced that with the death

448
00:18:26.574 --> 00:18:27.687
of a pet recently.

449
00:18:27.687 --> 00:18:29.470
I haven't felt quite the same.

450
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:31.525
<v ->Haven't felt quite the same.
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

451
00:18:31.525 --> 00:18:33.969
<v ->Immediately people go, "Oh, yeah."</v>

452
00:18:33.969 --> 00:18:36.228
Then I'll say, "Did you ever think you

453
00:18:36.228 --> 00:18:38.671
"could get that part of yourself back?"

454
00:18:38.671 --> 00:18:40.996
And the consistency of,

455
00:18:40.996 --> 00:18:43.844
"Really? That's possible?"

456
00:18:43.844 --> 00:18:46.724
And I'll go, "That's what I do."

457
00:18:46.724 --> 00:18:49.166
Rather than trying to explain it in a way

458
00:18:49.166 --> 00:18:51.417
that's intellectually satisfying for people

459
00:18:51.417 --> 00:18:53.017
with Western-shaped minds,

460
00:18:53.017 --> 00:18:55.320
this is actually a healing technique.

461
00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.774
It's one of the oldest that was based

462
00:18:57.774 --> 00:19:00.792
upon a very indigenous-shaped mind and heart,

463
00:19:00.792 --> 00:19:04.461
and so doing this work is sometimes going beyond

464
00:19:04.461 --> 00:19:07.042
what we can mentally comprehend.

465
00:19:07.042 --> 00:19:09.197
I think back to when I was in medical school.

466
00:19:09.197 --> 00:19:11.927
The closest we got to describing anything

467
00:19:11.927 --> 00:19:14.775
that sounded similar to person dealing

468
00:19:14.775 --> 00:19:18.327
with soul loss is they've lost the will to live.

469
00:19:18.327 --> 00:19:19.586
<v Regina>Right.</v>

470
00:19:19.586 --> 00:19:22.647
<v ->That's about it, and in terms of failure to thrive,</v>

471
00:19:22.647 --> 00:19:25.207
we do have medical codes for infants and elders

472
00:19:25.207 --> 00:19:27.222
because there are physiological indicators

473
00:19:27.222 --> 00:19:30.966
of failure to thrive for those age brackets,

474
00:19:30.966 --> 00:19:33.291
but what about the rest of us?

475
00:19:33.291 --> 00:19:35.606
So there's a large percentage of the population

476
00:19:35.606 --> 00:19:36.705
that I would say definitely,

477
00:19:36.705 --> 00:19:38.352
and there's certain patterns of loss

478
00:19:38.352 --> 00:19:41.516
that you do this work long enough you go, "Aha".

479
00:19:41.516 --> 00:19:42.683
This is part of what

480
00:19:42.683 --> 00:19:44.518
our society is consistently dealing with.

481
00:19:44.518 --> 00:19:45.663
<v Regina>Let's talk about that.</v>

482
00:19:45.663 --> 00:19:46.842
Let's talk about patterns of loss.

483
00:19:46.842 --> 00:19:49.370
Let's start with the most vulnerable situation,

484
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:52.069
a baby that appears to be physically normal

485
00:19:52.069 --> 00:19:54.991
but somehow there's not the will to survive

486
00:19:54.991 --> 00:19:57.295
and may end up dying through SIDS

487
00:19:57.295 --> 00:19:59.269
or something very early on.

488
00:19:59.269 --> 00:20:02.489
Have you seen anything regarding this subject?

489
00:20:02.489 --> 00:20:04.953
For example, about a newly incarnated soul

490
00:20:04.953 --> 00:20:06.862
into a baby's body?

491
00:20:06.862 --> 00:20:07.988
<v ->Yeah.</v>

492
00:20:07.988 --> 00:20:11.772
It can, just in putting out the possibilities,

493
00:20:11.772 --> 00:20:16.441
it can be that that child had a kind of contract

494
00:20:16.441 --> 00:20:19.887
in which they weren't meant to live very long anyway.

495
00:20:19.887 --> 00:20:22.418
Let me just put that out there.

496
00:20:22.418 --> 00:20:25.101
It's important to honor a life's contract,

497
00:20:25.101 --> 00:20:27.213
no matter how long a child lives,

498
00:20:27.213 --> 00:20:30.039
even if it's a miscarriage.

499
00:20:30.039 --> 00:20:33.175
I have had personal experience of that

500
00:20:33.175 --> 00:20:35.426
in which I've benefitted a great deal

501
00:20:35.426 --> 00:20:37.889
at my own level of healing and recovery of a soul part

502
00:20:37.889 --> 00:20:39.351
as a result of a miscarriage

503
00:20:39.351 --> 00:20:41.537
by meeting with the spirit of that baby,

504
00:20:41.537 --> 00:20:44.524
in which the baby said, "I wasn't meant to be born.

505
00:20:44.524 --> 00:20:47.975
"I was just meant to have a certain energetic association

506
00:20:47.975 --> 00:20:49.074
<v Regina>I'm getting chills.</v>

507
00:20:49.074 --> 00:20:50.301
<v ->"and then go back out again."</v>

508
00:20:50.301 --> 00:20:51.015
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

509
00:20:51.015 --> 00:20:53.698
<v ->So I want to order every life contract.</v>

510
00:20:53.698 --> 00:20:57.292
At the same time, it is possible that soul loss occurred

511
00:20:57.292 --> 00:21:00.918
during the pregnancy for this child.

512
00:21:00.918 --> 00:21:03.585
Soul loss may have occurred during the birth,

513
00:21:03.585 --> 00:21:06.401
and it certainly can occur any time after birth

514
00:21:06.401 --> 00:21:07.702
in that first year,

515
00:21:07.702 --> 00:21:10.624
which is still a kind of mortality issue period,

516
00:21:10.624 --> 00:21:14.473
and there's stages in which incarnation is occurring,

517
00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:19.140
and the birth soul loss is very classic

518
00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.273
in terms of a core loss.

519
00:21:21.273 --> 00:21:23.694
As we know, there's a history of the challenge

520
00:21:23.694 --> 00:21:27.033
of the hospital environment and birthing rights,

521
00:21:27.033 --> 00:21:31.427
and birthing centers have increased over the last 25 years.

522
00:21:31.427 --> 00:21:35.011
There are also issues of the nature

523
00:21:35.011 --> 00:21:37.402
of the dynamic within the family,

524
00:21:37.402 --> 00:21:40.388
the psychological reality of the parents,

525
00:21:40.388 --> 00:21:42.500
the economic reality.

526
00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.292
There are all these things that are in the air

527
00:21:44.292 --> 00:21:46.212
or in the mood or in the emotions,

528
00:21:46.212 --> 00:21:49.539
especially of the mother, that can be felt by the child,

529
00:21:49.539 --> 00:21:52.558
who doesn't have the kind of filtering system

530
00:21:52.558 --> 00:21:55.662
that you develop once you are here

531
00:21:55.662 --> 00:21:59.288
and living the life in a body,

532
00:21:59.288 --> 00:22:01.539
so there are perceptual challenges.

533
00:22:01.539 --> 00:22:04.024
There may even be metabolic challenges

534
00:22:04.024 --> 00:22:06.274
that create soul loss, all for the sake

535
00:22:06.274 --> 00:22:08.958
that the child will experience that soul loss

536
00:22:08.958 --> 00:22:12.918
in order to be born, and in order to remain alive.

537
00:22:12.918 --> 00:22:16.331
In that one sense, it's serving a very important purpose,

538
00:22:16.331 --> 00:22:20.278
and yet, to lose a core soul part at the time of birth

539
00:22:20.278 --> 00:22:23.232
or before or following, this is important

540
00:22:23.232 --> 00:22:26.384
that this reunion be facilitated.

541
00:22:26.384 --> 00:22:30.624
There is a lot of that influence

542
00:22:30.624 --> 00:22:32.534
of that loss that will

543
00:22:32.534 --> 00:22:35.180
in fact predict or possibly set

544
00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:38.100
up a continuing loss pattern

545
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.290
later on in life, and this is

546
00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:43.588
where it's not just the individual loss incidences,

547
00:22:43.588 --> 00:22:46.359
but you start to see a pattern in a person's life

548
00:22:46.359 --> 00:22:49.217
in which there is a sequence of losses based

549
00:22:49.217 --> 00:22:52.529
upon that pattern showing up again.

550
00:22:52.529 --> 00:22:55.797
<v Regina>Don't we also choose our relationships</v>

551
00:22:55.797 --> 00:22:59.522
in a sense to reflect that which we're either looking for

552
00:22:59.522 --> 00:23:01.196
or have lost?
<v ->Sure.</v>

553
00:23:01.196 --> 00:23:02.722
<v Regina>Can you talk about that a bit</v>

554
00:23:02.722 --> 00:23:04.748
and how you've seen this play itself out?

555
00:23:04.748 --> 00:23:05.793
<v ->I have.</v>

556
00:23:05.793 --> 00:23:10.476
I've seen individuals come in with almost the same script,

557
00:23:10.476 --> 00:23:12.580
and being born into a family

558
00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.689
in which my childhood didn't last very long

559
00:23:14.689 --> 00:23:16.673
because I had to take care of the parents.

560
00:23:16.673 --> 00:23:19.789
I had to raise them rather than they raising me.

561
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:23.125
There's also the soul loss that will occur

562
00:23:23.125 --> 00:23:27.370
in which there is oftentimes some kind

563
00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:30.016
of inadequate bonding with a parent,

564
00:23:30.016 --> 00:23:32.650
maybe even the gender of the baby is not acceptable

565
00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:36.319
to one of the parents, and then that same sex parent,

566
00:23:36.319 --> 00:23:40.404
as it shows up in other relationships,

567
00:23:40.404 --> 00:23:44.191
will have an impact and trigger other kinds of losses

568
00:23:44.191 --> 00:23:46.271
based upon the same kind of attitude.

569
00:23:46.271 --> 00:23:48.500
Say a woman born a girl not a boy.

570
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.892
The father objects. He's been expecting a boy.

571
00:23:51.892 --> 00:23:53.974
There's vast disappointment there.

572
00:23:53.974 --> 00:23:55.603
He kind of backs off.

573
00:23:55.603 --> 00:23:58.110
He's hand's off, doesn't know what to do with a little girl.

574
00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.456
You can see that then with teachers

575
00:24:00.456 --> 00:24:02.014
and employers and boyfriends.

576
00:24:02.014 --> 00:24:03.891
<v Regina>It keeps showing up, the same cycle.</v>

577
00:24:03.891 --> 00:24:05.235
<v ->It keeps showing up in which it just,</v>

578
00:24:05.235 --> 00:24:07.187
the pattern cycles into these relationships,

579
00:24:07.187 --> 00:24:10.280
and it may be that the soul loss occurred

580
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.106
because her male boss fired her,

581
00:24:13.106 --> 00:24:15.474
and yet when the journey occurs,

582
00:24:15.474 --> 00:24:17.287
we discover there was something

583
00:24:17.287 --> 00:24:18.567
that occurred at her birth,

584
00:24:18.567 --> 00:24:21.426
and what can you do as a newborn about your gender?

585
00:24:21.426 --> 00:24:24.092
Nothing, so a part of you will leave

586
00:24:24.092 --> 00:24:28.316
in order to survive that situation

587
00:24:28.316 --> 00:24:31.078
that's going on around you, that's being projected at you

588
00:24:31.078 --> 00:24:33.798
or not made available to you in a bonding way.

589
00:24:33.798 --> 00:24:36.635
It is interesting when you do go and look back

590
00:24:36.635 --> 00:24:38.609
at the patterns in a person's life

591
00:24:38.609 --> 00:24:42.598
and realize, "Aha, I see. It actually began here

592
00:24:42.598 --> 00:24:46.800
and not just when the employment issue showed up."

593
00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.328
<v Regina>Can you give us a couple more examples?</v>

594
00:24:49.328 --> 00:24:52.347
Just everybody loves to hear stories

595
00:24:52.347 --> 00:24:54.096
so we can relate to ourselves,

596
00:24:54.096 --> 00:24:57.778
and that have been particularly profound to you.

597
00:24:58.477 --> 00:25:02.804
<v ->Yes, I've done over 3, 000 soul retrievals,</v>

598
00:25:02.804 --> 00:25:05.836
and I do keep case studies on each one,

599
00:25:05.836 --> 00:25:07.265
and the way in which it unfolds,

600
00:25:07.265 --> 00:25:10.764
it allows me to stay connected to the story,

601
00:25:10.764 --> 00:25:13.793
and yet, there is a process at the end of the session

602
00:25:13.793 --> 00:25:17.204
in which I'm literally lifted out of the direct experience,

603
00:25:17.204 --> 00:25:20.212
and I'm not afforded a lot of recall of all the details.

604
00:25:20.212 --> 00:25:21.132
<v Regina>I understand.</v>

605
00:25:21.132 --> 00:25:23.820
<v ->And that creates confidentiality for the person,</v>

606
00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.108
but I have had some extraordinary incidents.

607
00:25:28.108 --> 00:25:31.220
Just to give a little of a preliminary of this is

608
00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:34.036
that I was approached by a mother

609
00:25:34.036 --> 00:25:36.020
and her 19 year old daughter,

610
00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.540
and she was a single mom, had raised this girl.

611
00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:39.904
They were very close.

612
00:25:39.904 --> 00:25:41.760
Their closeness was now getting in the way

613
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.344
of the daughter moving on and being her own person,

614
00:25:45.344 --> 00:25:47.904
and they felt as if there was some soul loss

615
00:25:47.904 --> 00:25:50.700
that had gone on during their troubled past,

616
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.619
and as well as the absence of the father

617
00:25:53.619 --> 00:25:55.603
and emotional neediness,

618
00:25:55.603 --> 00:26:00.603
and they really wanted to both experience retrieval.

619
00:26:00.787 --> 00:26:03.328
Those session occurred,

620
00:26:03.328 --> 00:26:05.971
and they're very happy with where they proceeded,

621
00:26:05.971 --> 00:26:07.339
but I want to tell you something interesting

622
00:26:07.339 --> 00:26:09.683
that occurred in the preliminary phase

623
00:26:09.683 --> 00:26:11.795
because I just don't stop, drop,

624
00:26:11.795 --> 00:26:13.331
and go and get a soul part.

625
00:26:13.331 --> 00:26:16.211
I actually first shift and make connection

626
00:26:16.211 --> 00:26:18.496
with the local nature spirits,

627
00:26:18.496 --> 00:26:19.584
and there are many more of them

628
00:26:19.584 --> 00:26:21.011
than they are manifested,

629
00:26:21.011 --> 00:26:23.147
although we live in this extraordinary place being

630
00:26:23.147 --> 00:26:26.560
that it has, well, it's the second largest urban forrest

631
00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:27.967
on the planet.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

632
00:26:27.967 --> 00:26:31.787
<v ->I'm lucky in that I draw upon the tree spirits</v>

633
00:26:31.787 --> 00:26:34.559
and the plant and animal spirits, and along with that,

634
00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:38.090
there is a small cluster of Native American spirits

635
00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:41.014
that come up from a creek area not far from my office

636
00:26:41.014 --> 00:26:43.485
when they hear the drumming begin,

637
00:26:43.485 --> 00:26:45.341
and they contribute by making a circle

638
00:26:45.341 --> 00:26:47.325
around me and the person,

639
00:26:47.325 --> 00:26:50.485
walls and asphalt have disappeared in my visionary state.

640
00:26:50.485 --> 00:26:54.069
They look to enhance, in a preliminary way,

641
00:26:54.069 --> 00:26:57.269
just the setting in which I'm doing this work,

642
00:26:57.269 --> 00:27:01.533
the sacredness of this, the enhanced sense of support,

643
00:27:01.533 --> 00:27:04.501
and they will in fact focus their energy on the person,

644
00:27:04.501 --> 00:27:06.973
and extend to them sometimes either a prayer

645
00:27:06.973 --> 00:27:10.877
or a chant or a gift, and all of this is the protocol

646
00:27:10.877 --> 00:27:13.417
that leads then into doing the retrieval.

647
00:27:13.417 --> 00:27:16.445
When the young woman came, the daughter came,

648
00:27:16.445 --> 00:27:18.064
and we had our chance to share,

649
00:27:18.064 --> 00:27:19.899
I'm at this point in the journey,

650
00:27:19.899 --> 00:27:22.480
the preliminary phase when the Native Americans come,

651
00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.019
and they bring a one person canoe,

652
00:27:25.019 --> 00:27:27.555
and they put it right next to her.

653
00:27:27.555 --> 00:27:30.351
Immediately I think, "Ah, this is the invitation

654
00:27:30.351 --> 00:27:32.688
"for her to get in her own canoe."

655
00:27:32.688 --> 00:27:36.189
"Symbolic as it is now, and begin her own journey."

656
00:27:36.189 --> 00:27:37.597
But they weren't done.

657
00:27:37.597 --> 00:27:41.628
They started filling the canoe with yams. (Regina laughs)

658
00:27:41.628 --> 00:27:44.808
Now, this is very typical of seeing something

659
00:27:44.808 --> 00:27:47.472
in a journey in which it's very symbolic.

660
00:27:47.472 --> 00:27:50.076
You don't know what it means,

661
00:27:50.076 --> 00:27:53.552
and so you just allow your observation to hold onto it.

662
00:27:53.552 --> 00:27:55.984
When the canoe was fully filled,

663
00:27:55.984 --> 00:27:58.460
they stopped and they maintained their composure,

664
00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.336
and I went right into the journey.

665
00:28:00.336 --> 00:28:03.644
What I shared with her about the journey afterwards,

666
00:28:03.644 --> 00:28:05.775
I said, " Let me start with how it began."

667
00:28:05.775 --> 00:28:08.207
And I told her about the canoe and the yams.

668
00:28:08.207 --> 00:28:10.108
I said, "Boy, I don't know what that's about.

669
00:28:10.108 --> 00:28:13.696
"I sure hope you like yams." and she started to cry.

670
00:28:13.766 --> 00:28:16.799
I said, "You don't like yams?" (both laugh)

671
00:28:16.799 --> 00:28:18.911
She said, "You would not have known this,

672
00:28:18.911 --> 00:28:21.107
"but when my mother and I are in public

673
00:28:21.107 --> 00:28:23.430
"and we're either saying goodbye to each other

674
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:27.224
"or we're greeting each other, we say, 'yams'."

675
00:28:28.166 --> 00:28:29.912
I said, "You do?"

676
00:28:29.982 --> 00:28:33.019
She said, "Yes. It stands for you are my sunshine."

677
00:28:33.019 --> 00:28:35.077
<v Regina>Aw.</v>

678
00:28:35.147 --> 00:28:36.979
<v ->This is to indicate to you that the work</v>

679
00:28:36.979 --> 00:28:38.987
that's done is in response to the person

680
00:28:38.987 --> 00:28:40.895
and not necessarily something that I pull out.

681
00:28:40.895 --> 00:28:42.292
<v Regina>Sorry.</v>

682
00:28:42.292 --> 00:28:43.469
<v ->We're back to our ... (laughs)</v>

683
00:28:43.469 --> 00:28:44.877
<v Regina>We're gonna have to ...</v>

684
00:28:44.877 --> 00:28:48.691
<v ->That sounds like a British breakfast. (all laugh)</v>

685
00:28:51.469 --> 00:28:53.286
<v Voiceover>The nightmare of every editor. (Jill laughs)</v>

686
00:28:53.286 --> 00:28:54.855
"Oh, it's okay. We can fix it in post.

687
00:28:54.855 --> 00:28:57.876
"Oh god, I can't believe she said that." (laughs)

688
00:28:57.882 --> 00:28:59.610
<v ->I did an interview at the Santa Fe conference</v>

689
00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:02.234
very much like this, and it was just about,

690
00:29:02.234 --> 00:29:05.031
you know, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet,

691
00:29:05.031 --> 00:29:08.322
and they started, and one of the crew's cellphone went off.

692
00:29:08.322 --> 00:29:11.606
<v Regina>Oh, that's the worst, when you do it to yourself.</v>

693
00:29:11.606 --> 00:29:14.762
Okay, well, while it's quiet, let's go ahead and pick it up.

694
00:29:14.762 --> 00:29:16.578
Can you give us an idea of a couple

695
00:29:16.578 --> 00:29:20.482
of the more profound experiences you've had with clients?

696
00:29:20.482 --> 00:29:25.465
<v ->Yes, and there's a wide variety to draw from,</v>

697
00:29:26.434 --> 00:29:30.571
including aspects of the journey experience

698
00:29:30.571 --> 00:29:32.383
that are part of the protocol

699
00:29:32.383 --> 00:29:35.897
before even getting into the retrieval part.

700
00:29:36.119 --> 00:29:38.187
It's important to know that things are done

701
00:29:38.187 --> 00:29:41.023
with stage dependency, if you will,

702
00:29:41.023 --> 00:29:44.991
and my spirits are very gracious and supportive of me,

703
00:29:44.991 --> 00:29:47.871
and yet they do ask that I take the time

704
00:29:47.871 --> 00:29:51.051
to first connect with the local nature spirits

705
00:29:51.051 --> 00:29:54.847
that are around me in the area in which I do this work,

706
00:29:54.847 --> 00:29:58.199
and I'm blessed to be in the Sacramento Valley area doing it

707
00:29:58.199 --> 00:30:00.183
because we have such a plethora

708
00:30:00.183 --> 00:30:03.018
of tree and plant and animal spirits.

709
00:30:03.018 --> 00:30:05.791
It is the second largest urban forrest in the world,

710
00:30:05.791 --> 00:30:09.034
second to Paris, and so even just looking out the window,

711
00:30:09.034 --> 00:30:11.466
you can identify a lot of tress, but guess what,

712
00:30:11.466 --> 00:30:14.391
there's a lot more tree spirits than there are manifested

713
00:30:14.391 --> 00:30:15.902
when you call to them,

714
00:30:15.902 --> 00:30:20.106
so it is a huge gathering of beautiful nature energy

715
00:30:20.106 --> 00:30:23.479
which supplies the power to do this work,

716
00:30:23.479 --> 00:30:27.678
and oftentimes there's a certain degree of something unique

717
00:30:27.678 --> 00:30:31.006
in that demonstration where it could be a certain tree

718
00:30:31.006 --> 00:30:34.142
or plant is featured or an aspect of the plants

719
00:30:34.142 --> 00:30:36.535
or animals are featured.

720
00:30:36.535 --> 00:30:38.474
There's also different times of day

721
00:30:38.474 --> 00:30:40.694
than the time of day I'm doing the journey,

722
00:30:40.694 --> 00:30:42.186
a different weather condition,

723
00:30:42.186 --> 00:30:43.382
even a different season.

724
00:30:43.382 --> 00:30:45.622
All of these things are asking me to notice.

725
00:30:45.622 --> 00:30:47.242
"Be observant, Jill."

726
00:30:47.242 --> 00:30:49.822
Which I do, and I'm more than glad to relay any

727
00:30:49.822 --> 00:30:51.786
of the uniqueness of the setting

728
00:30:51.786 --> 00:30:54.666
once I'm sharing the journey outcome.

729
00:30:54.666 --> 00:30:56.926
This one particular journey I did

730
00:30:56.926 --> 00:30:59.190
for a mother and a daughter

731
00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:02.390
actually it was gonna be two separate journeys to help them

732
00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:04.899
in the individualization process of the daughter.

733
00:31:04.899 --> 00:31:06.031
They were so close,

734
00:31:06.031 --> 00:31:08.739
having been a single mom and just the two of them,

735
00:31:08.739 --> 00:31:11.171
it was very hard for her now to make choices

736
00:31:11.171 --> 00:31:14.031
about creating a life for herself.

737
00:31:14.031 --> 00:31:16.315
So having looked back on a lot of the hardship,

738
00:31:16.315 --> 00:31:18.747
the emotional challenges, they knew that part

739
00:31:18.747 --> 00:31:19.855
of their healing would be for both

740
00:31:19.855 --> 00:31:22.095
of them to have soul retrieval.

741
00:31:22.095 --> 00:31:23.971
When the daughter came to me

742
00:31:23.971 --> 00:31:25.827
and I stepped into the journey,

743
00:31:25.827 --> 00:31:28.155
I called to the nature spirits and they came,

744
00:31:28.155 --> 00:31:30.735
and they were immediately supportive

745
00:31:30.735 --> 00:31:33.723
of all that we were doing, and then I also noticed

746
00:31:33.723 --> 00:31:37.051
that a group of Native American spirits that reside,

747
00:31:37.051 --> 00:31:40.462
I don't wanna say haunt, but they reside in the dream aspect

748
00:31:40.462 --> 00:31:43.451
of a creek area that's just a few blocks from my office,

749
00:31:43.451 --> 00:31:46.331
and they come and create a very supportive circle

750
00:31:46.331 --> 00:31:47.799
around us as well.

751
00:31:47.799 --> 00:31:49.851
Now when they came for this young woman,

752
00:31:49.851 --> 00:31:52.707
they brought a one person canoe,

753
00:31:52.707 --> 00:31:56.034
and in my mind's eye, it was like, "How symbolic."

754
00:31:56.034 --> 00:31:58.274
Again, this is all done in the visionary state,

755
00:31:58.274 --> 00:32:01.410
and this is the realm of symbol and imagery and metaphor.

756
00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:04.315
This is not about psyching this out,

757
00:32:04.315 --> 00:32:06.619
so I'm willing to look at any of the visuals

758
00:32:06.619 --> 00:32:09.691
that they're giving me as pure symbolism,

759
00:32:09.691 --> 00:32:12.034
and they brought this one person canoe.

760
00:32:12.034 --> 00:32:15.259
Quite symbolic of a person going off on their own adventure,

761
00:32:15.259 --> 00:32:17.858
going off to establish their own life,

762
00:32:17.858 --> 00:32:20.354
and yet what surprised me was they began

763
00:32:20.354 --> 00:32:24.986
to put into the canoe yams, and at first I thought,

764
00:32:24.986 --> 00:32:27.906
"This is odd, but here they go."

765
00:32:27.906 --> 00:32:30.254
And they continued to fill this canoe

766
00:32:30.254 --> 00:32:32.430
with yams right up to the top,

767
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:35.994
maybe room for her, but it was just mounded with yams,

768
00:32:35.994 --> 00:32:38.874
and still no clear understanding on my part,

769
00:32:38.874 --> 00:32:42.221
but my job in dong this work is to be very clear

770
00:32:42.221 --> 00:32:45.613
about what I'm observing so that I can articulate it

771
00:32:45.613 --> 00:32:47.834
and language it appropriately,

772
00:32:47.834 --> 00:32:50.178
and as I finished the journey

773
00:32:50.178 --> 00:32:52.058
and completed the soul retrieval,

774
00:32:52.058 --> 00:32:55.130
I started to share about the local nature spirits

775
00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:57.370
and the Native Americans and the fact they brought her

776
00:32:57.370 --> 00:32:59.949
this canoe and yet, what's with the yams?

777
00:32:59.949 --> 00:33:02.042
I even said, "I hope you like yams

778
00:33:02.042 --> 00:33:04.730
"because it looks as if you got a lot of them."

779
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:06.989
And when I indicated to her that

780
00:33:06.989 --> 00:33:09.185
that was very specifically pointed out to me

781
00:33:09.185 --> 00:33:11.766
that these were yams, she started to cry

782
00:33:11.766 --> 00:33:14.262
because there was a code between she and her mother.

783
00:33:14.262 --> 00:33:16.161
When they were in public and they wanted

784
00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:18.465
to express great affection for each other

785
00:33:18.465 --> 00:33:20.150
without embarrassing each other,

786
00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:21.837
whether they were meeting or parting,

787
00:33:21.837 --> 00:33:23.949
they would use the code word "YAMS",

788
00:33:23.949 --> 00:33:25.997
and it stands for you are my sunshine.

789
00:33:25.997 --> 00:33:27.425
<v Regina>Aw, aw.</v>

790
00:33:27.425 --> 00:33:28.981
<v ->Now, I didn't know this.</v>

791
00:33:28.981 --> 00:33:31.821
It's a pure gift on the part of the spirits

792
00:33:31.821 --> 00:33:35.553
to let her know that in any effort to individuate

793
00:33:35.553 --> 00:33:38.336
and move into her own life that she's going with plenty

794
00:33:38.336 --> 00:33:40.877
of you are my sunshine from mom. (both laugh)

795
00:33:40.877 --> 00:33:42.221
<v Regina>The connection's still there.</v>

796
00:33:42.221 --> 00:33:43.885
<v ->It's still there in heaps,</v>

797
00:33:43.885 --> 00:33:48.591
and I mention this because it is important

798
00:33:48.725 --> 00:33:53.652
in doing this work that you honor the great truth

799
00:33:53.652 --> 00:33:56.788
that's coming for the benefit of this individual

800
00:33:56.788 --> 00:33:58.349
and not necessarily something

801
00:33:58.349 --> 00:34:00.033
that I'm trying to make happen.

802
00:34:00.033 --> 00:34:00.909
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

803
00:34:00.909 --> 00:34:02.785
<v ->My willingness to speak about these things</v>

804
00:34:02.785 --> 00:34:05.748
that I don't fully understand is part of the magic

805
00:34:05.748 --> 00:34:09.140
because it creates a validation moment for that person.

806
00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:10.996
<v Regina>And it takes courage on your part to say,</v>

807
00:34:10.996 --> 00:34:13.708
"Well, you know, the canoe's full of yams."

808
00:34:13.708 --> 00:34:14.369
<v ->Yes.</v>

809
00:34:14.369 --> 00:34:16.820
<v Regina>And feel foolish not knowing what</v>

810
00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.209
this is about at times too.

811
00:34:18.209 --> 00:34:20.276
<v ->I have often said to people,</v>

812
00:34:20.276 --> 00:34:22.604
"My language is going to get a little flowery.

813
00:34:22.604 --> 00:34:25.953
"It's gonna be like I'm reporting from your fairytale."

814
00:34:25.953 --> 00:34:26.956
(both laugh)

815
00:34:26.956 --> 00:34:28.001
I'll give them a little warning

816
00:34:28.001 --> 00:34:29.876
that it may start to sound like that,

817
00:34:29.876 --> 00:34:32.289
and one of the ways in which I got comfortable languaging

818
00:34:32.289 --> 00:34:35.232
these things was by reading fairytales out loud,

819
00:34:35.232 --> 00:34:38.156
as I did to my children when they were little, and so

820
00:34:38.156 --> 00:34:41.356
after while, you realize that the support is not gonna end

821
00:34:41.356 --> 00:34:42.420
at what I'm seeing.

822
00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:45.324
It's gonna continue so that I'm able to language

823
00:34:45.324 --> 00:34:47.904
this experience in a way in which whatever needs

824
00:34:47.904 --> 00:34:52.172
to truly be transferred is transferred in that way,

825
00:34:52.172 --> 00:34:55.948
and I'm not trying to make it reasonable or understandable

826
00:34:55.948 --> 00:34:57.651
in the way in which I'm talking about it.

827
00:34:57.651 --> 00:35:01.914
<v Regina>How did it end with the girl and her mother?</v>

828
00:35:02.643 --> 00:35:03.756
How did they ...

829
00:35:03.756 --> 00:35:05.292
<v ->They both were very honoring</v>

830
00:35:05.292 --> 00:35:06.848
of the soul parts they got back.

831
00:35:06.848 --> 00:35:09.856
They had actually swapped soul parts.

832
00:35:09.856 --> 00:35:11.776
The mother had a soul part of her daughter.

833
00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:13.760
The daughter had a soul part of her mother,

834
00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.083
and they did a ritual to return the soul part

835
00:35:16.083 --> 00:35:17.427
to each other.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

836
00:35:17.427 --> 00:35:19.264
<v ->In doing so, it really does allow</v>

837
00:35:19.264 --> 00:35:21.395
for a more complete individuation

838
00:35:21.395 --> 00:35:24.960
in which the girl's boundary and the mother's boundary

839
00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.603
could even continue to mature,

840
00:35:27.603 --> 00:35:29.412
and they could meet each other at the boundary

841
00:35:29.412 --> 00:35:31.564
with still a heart-to-heart connection.

842
00:35:31.564 --> 00:35:34.276
I don't think the girl moved far, far away,

843
00:35:34.276 --> 00:35:37.476
but I mean, it was more than 10 miles from mom,

844
00:35:37.476 --> 00:35:40.568
and in doing so, they were able to move their relationship

845
00:35:40.568 --> 00:35:44.536
to a whole new plateau of knowing each other as women,

846
00:35:44.536 --> 00:35:47.480
and continue to be of, I think,

847
00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.336
great value to each other.

848
00:35:49.336 --> 00:35:51.468
But it's a maturing up process.

849
00:35:51.468 --> 00:35:53.348
I've often said, "You know, when you claim

850
00:35:53.348 --> 00:35:55.180
"what's rightfully yours to claim,

851
00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.999
"so much more is possible."

852
00:35:56.999 --> 00:36:00.027
And when you maintain a sense of a mutual connection,

853
00:36:00.027 --> 00:36:02.291
whether it's with your mother or your daughter,

854
00:36:02.291 --> 00:36:04.743
or with the spirits that are here to serve us, you're

855
00:36:04.743 --> 00:36:08.538
creating a real medium for magic to flow.

856
00:36:08.538 --> 00:36:11.674
So calling yourself back, releasing what belongs to

857
00:36:11.674 --> 00:36:14.643
somebody else, is actually of great service in bringing

858
00:36:14.643 --> 00:36:18.663
a lot of promise as to what is possible.

859
00:36:18.663 --> 00:36:21.155
<v Regina>Assuming not everybody can find somebody</v>

860
00:36:21.155 --> 00:36:25.066
like you, to have this private experience, although, we're

861
00:36:25.066 --> 00:36:27.074
going to give your contact info so I hope you're ready

862
00:36:27.074 --> 00:36:30.678
for a little bit of action there if you have time, how can

863
00:36:30.678 --> 00:36:34.211
one facilitate this for themselves, or can they?

864
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:37.673
<v ->This has always been an important consideration</v>

865
00:36:37.673 --> 00:36:42.673
of mine, I tend to choose work, which really is about

866
00:36:43.286 --> 00:36:45.859
eliminating my work.

867
00:36:46.678 --> 00:36:51.049
So as I began to recognize the potential here, of

868
00:36:51.049 --> 00:36:54.270
being of service, then I realized in yet really, the care

869
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:57.495
and the nurturing of our soul is our own primary

870
00:36:57.495 --> 00:37:00.024
responsibility.

871
00:37:00.139 --> 00:37:03.895
So first thing, is I let people know it's possible.

872
00:37:03.895 --> 00:37:06.199
I let people know that there is this phenomenon of

873
00:37:06.199 --> 00:37:11.019
soul loss and that you can, in fact, call yourself back.

874
00:37:11.019 --> 00:37:14.390
It's easiest to do during the time that's more acute,

875
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:18.614
or in the earlier beginning phase of soul loss, before

876
00:37:18.614 --> 00:37:21.828
things have had a chance to dissociate.

877
00:37:22.365 --> 00:37:25.397
What I have experienced, and again, it's not about

878
00:37:25.397 --> 00:37:27.613
never having soul loss again.

879
00:37:27.613 --> 00:37:30.282
It's really accepting it as an adaptive mechanism

880
00:37:30.282 --> 00:37:32.393
and noticing when I have it.

881
00:37:32.393 --> 00:37:35.009
I encourage people who come to me, and groups

882
00:37:35.009 --> 00:37:38.421
that I talk to, notice when you have it and validate

883
00:37:38.421 --> 00:37:42.197
the fact that it's occurred, and such that even if there

884
00:37:42.197 --> 00:37:46.317
is, like the sudden loss of a family member or a pet,

885
00:37:46.317 --> 00:37:49.153
there is that odd feeling throughout the day as you're

886
00:37:49.153 --> 00:37:52.180
having to deal and to talk with people, and cope

887
00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:55.937
with your emotional swings, before you go to bed at night,

888
00:37:55.937 --> 00:37:59.918
before you step into the dream world, call yourself back.

889
00:38:00.244 --> 00:38:01.613
<v Regina>Interesting, I have a friend that does that</v>

890
00:38:01.613 --> 00:38:03.892
every morning upon awakening, as well.

891
00:38:03.892 --> 00:38:06.516
<v ->Yes, and I would encourage that, too, because there</v>

892
00:38:06.516 --> 00:38:09.204
are times in which, sometimes we just want to stay

893
00:38:09.204 --> 00:38:11.916
out in that dream world and not come all the way back in

894
00:38:11.916 --> 00:38:14.113
as we awaken in the morning.

895
00:38:14.113 --> 00:38:19.113
So this becomes part of personal, self care of the soul.

896
00:38:20.705 --> 00:38:22.388
<v Regina>Makes total sense.</v>

897
00:38:22.388 --> 00:38:25.396
<v ->Absolutely, and again, I come from a physical rehab</v>

898
00:38:25.396 --> 00:38:28.064
background where it's really about being very practical,

899
00:38:28.064 --> 00:38:32.628
keeping things ethical, and simple, and affording people

900
00:38:32.628 --> 00:38:35.232
much more of their own personal empowerment.

901
00:38:35.232 --> 00:38:37.748
Now, there is something called dissociation.

902
00:38:37.748 --> 00:38:41.184
At first, I thought it is this disconnect in which these

903
00:38:41.184 --> 00:38:45.196
soul parts really do leave this time, space, energetic

904
00:38:45.196 --> 00:38:48.544
continuum, and they're outside of time.

905
00:38:48.544 --> 00:38:51.596
Well, we just have to create that reconnection, and low

906
00:38:51.596 --> 00:38:53.388
and behold, they'll come back.

907
00:38:53.388 --> 00:38:56.076
But, I had somebody come to me, and then more than one

908
00:38:56.076 --> 00:38:59.424
person said "Why aren't they looking for me"?

909
00:38:59.424 --> 00:39:02.112
And I thought good question.

910
00:39:02.112 --> 00:39:04.883
So I actually will meet with my heeling team, and

911
00:39:04.883 --> 00:39:08.812
further these discussions by asking these questions.

912
00:39:08.812 --> 00:39:11.840
Something that I learned, again, makes sense now,

913
00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.784
is that not only are they disconnected, but they're

914
00:39:14.784 --> 00:39:18.771
outside of time where there isn't a sense of the past,

915
00:39:18.771 --> 00:39:21.120
and it's just that now.

916
00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:24.595
So it isn't like needing to remember anything.

917
00:39:24.595 --> 00:39:25.643
<v Regina>Or find it's way back.</v>

918
00:39:25.643 --> 00:39:26.880
<v ->Or find it's way back.</v>

919
00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.888
Many soul parts are in a location in the spirit world,

920
00:39:29.888 --> 00:39:32.339
in which they're getting exactly what they needed at

921
00:39:32.339 --> 00:39:33.771
the time they left.

922
00:39:33.771 --> 00:39:36.479
So if you're very young, in a disempowered time of

923
00:39:36.479 --> 00:39:39.699
your life, and you really were in a situation where you

924
00:39:39.699 --> 00:39:41.727
needed more power, more support, and probably

925
00:39:41.727 --> 00:39:43.775
more protection.

926
00:39:43.775 --> 00:39:47.551
There's a good reason to dissociate and go into

927
00:39:47.551 --> 00:39:50.239
the lower world of dream, which is the great dreaming

928
00:39:50.239 --> 00:39:53.675
of nature, and also the location where you're gonna

929
00:39:53.675 --> 00:39:56.761
experience power, support, and protection.

930
00:39:56.914 --> 00:40:00.075
Now, what helps is when you establish the reconnection

931
00:40:00.075 --> 00:40:05.075
to the soul part, that soul part can begin to remember

932
00:40:05.151 --> 00:40:09.906
it's source, that individual, and so if in fact,

933
00:40:09.906 --> 00:40:14.090
there is not a practitioner that you wanna work with,

934
00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:16.970
and there are reasons to work with a practitioner,

935
00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:20.490
it's still possible, by first establishing a connection

936
00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:23.071
between yourself and that soul part.

937
00:40:23.071 --> 00:40:27.594
It does mean going into a sincere hurt, and

938
00:40:27.594 --> 00:40:32.223
express that desire to reconnect with that soul part

939
00:40:32.223 --> 00:40:34.719
that left, or all of your soul parts.

940
00:40:34.719 --> 00:40:37.662
Doing so means that you've got to be very truthful,

941
00:40:37.662 --> 00:40:40.862
contacting your inner source of wisdom and truth, and

942
00:40:40.862 --> 00:40:43.530
have it support and express your need.

943
00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:46.410
And it means taking a look at what's not working

944
00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:48.498
in your life, big or small.

945
00:40:48.498 --> 00:40:51.402
Also, look back over your life, what are the patterns

946
00:40:51.402 --> 00:40:52.766
that don't serve you?

947
00:40:52.766 --> 00:40:55.858
Sometimes you'll see it behaviorally, or in a relationship

948
00:40:55.858 --> 00:40:58.801
style, or in your own mood, or attitude,

949
00:40:58.801 --> 00:41:00.417
whatever it might be...

950
00:41:00.417 --> 00:41:01.470
<v Regina>Or in physical issues.</v>

951
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:04.584
<v ->Physical issues, and then understand that there may</v>

952
00:41:04.584 --> 00:41:08.403
be soul loss that corresponds to that, and look to

953
00:41:08.403 --> 00:41:10.408
reconnect to those soul parts.

954
00:41:10.408 --> 00:41:15.315
And in doing so, you're inviting a reversal of the

955
00:41:15.315 --> 00:41:18.771
dissociation by first, by making the connection.

956
00:41:18.771 --> 00:41:22.395
Now, we are not really meant to do everything alone.

957
00:41:22.395 --> 00:41:26.515
So even if there's not a practitioner in your community,

958
00:41:26.515 --> 00:41:30.247
you can begin to foster relationship with spirit helpers,

959
00:41:30.247 --> 00:41:35.003
spirit guides, and call upon them to enter in such

960
00:41:35.003 --> 00:41:38.291
a way that they assist in the soul part coming back.

961
00:41:38.291 --> 00:41:42.279
Just knowing they can come back is a big step.

962
00:41:42.279 --> 00:41:45.819
And the fact that you can be very proactive about this

963
00:41:45.819 --> 00:41:48.935
is another big step, but you do have to establish a

964
00:41:48.935 --> 00:41:51.578
certain degree of relationship, even if it's just with

965
00:41:51.578 --> 00:41:54.842
the soul part cause what are relating to?

966
00:41:54.842 --> 00:41:57.447
An aspect of yourself that hasn't been available

967
00:41:57.447 --> 00:42:00.666
to you in a long time and it does require a certain

968
00:42:00.666 --> 00:42:03.847
degree of extending yourself in order for it to be

969
00:42:03.847 --> 00:42:06.017
reunited with you.

970
00:42:08.371 --> 00:42:10.439
<v ->If this subject is of interest to you, you might</v>

971
00:42:10.439 --> 00:42:13.042
also enjoy the interview we did with Jill's husband,

972
00:42:13.042 --> 00:42:16.050
Hank Wesselman, as a shaman and anthropologist,

973
00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:19.143
he's experienced the world of spirit in all it's forms

974
00:42:19.143 --> 00:42:21.618
and has a fascinating story to tell.

975
00:42:21.618 --> 00:42:23.922
In Hank's second interview, we speak specifically

976
00:42:23.922 --> 00:42:25.586
about soul retrieval.

977
00:42:25.586 --> 00:42:29.140
Until next time, thanks for watching.
