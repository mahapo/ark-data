00:00:00.372 --> 00:00:05.229
(gentle music)

2
00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:15.198
<v ->If you could have a user's guide to your brain</v>

3
00:00:15.198 --> 00:00:16.510
would you use it?

4
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.135
Rick Hanson, Neurophysiologist, and author of Buddha's Brain

5
00:00:20.135 --> 00:00:21.875
has written just such a guide.

6
00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:24.338
It explains in simple and compassionate terms

7
00:00:24.338 --> 00:00:26.493
how our brains are naturally wired,

8
00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:28.253
and some of the simple things we can do

9
00:00:28.253 --> 00:00:30.738
to begin programming them from negativity

10
00:00:30.738 --> 00:00:32.617
to peace and contentment.

11
00:00:32.617 --> 00:00:35.180
And, we can all do it.

12
00:00:42.097 --> 00:00:43.932
Before I even begin the interview,

13
00:00:43.932 --> 00:00:46.172
I wanted to tell you just a wee story

14
00:00:46.172 --> 00:00:47.676
that happened the other day

15
00:00:47.676 --> 00:00:50.717
while I was researching your book for this interview,

16
00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.209
which was perfect timing.

17
00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:53.936
It had to do with my son and his girlfriend,

18
00:00:53.936 --> 00:00:56.273
and they were looking over some problematic elements

19
00:00:56.273 --> 00:00:59.451
as young entrepreneurs, and some stuck attitudes,

20
00:00:59.451 --> 00:01:03.174
and she said, "I just have to snap out of it, don't I?"

21
00:01:03.174 --> 00:01:06.448
And I said, "Ah, ah-ha, I'm reading this book,

22
00:01:06.448 --> 00:01:08.047
"easier said than done.

23
00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:11.152
"Sometimes we can't just snap out of it

24
00:01:11.152 --> 00:01:13.371
"because there's a lot going on

25
00:01:13.371 --> 00:01:15.653
"in this programmed behavior of ours."

26
00:01:15.653 --> 00:01:20.653
So, your background in neurophysiology,

27
00:01:20.891 --> 00:01:25.210
as well as with a long tradition of meditation.

28
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.908
You bring the two worlds together in a really beautiful way.

29
00:01:27.908 --> 00:01:31.054
This is a wonderful user's manual for the brain.

30
00:01:31.054 --> 00:01:33.303
<v ->Plus I've been a therapist for a long time.</v>

31
00:01:33.303 --> 00:01:34.977
And a dad and a husband.

32
00:01:34.977 --> 00:01:36.534
<v Regina>Oh, that's it, that's where it comes from.</v>

33
00:01:36.534 --> 00:01:37.740
<v ->That's the real training--</v>

34
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.846
<v Regina>That's the training. (laughing)</v>

35
00:01:38.846 --> 00:01:40.911
<v ->Have a long-term marriage with young adult kids.</v>

36
00:01:40.911 --> 00:01:42.234
<v Regina>So tell us a little background</v>

37
00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:45.241
about why you decided to write the book Buddha's Brain.

38
00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:46.883
'Cause people are really relating to it.

39
00:01:46.883 --> 00:01:48.531
<v ->Yeah, thank you.</v>

40
00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:51.960
I've always been interested in what would make people happy.

41
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.626
I mean, I was selfishly interested, I wanted to be happy.

42
00:01:54.626 --> 00:01:55.725
Broadly defined happy,

43
00:01:55.725 --> 00:01:58.040
not like go to Disneyland for one day happy,

44
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.237
but deeply contented in a way

45
00:02:00.237 --> 00:02:01.901
that was relatively unshakable.

46
00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:03.703
I mean, that would respond to situations,

47
00:02:03.703 --> 00:02:05.493
but had a core to it

48
00:02:05.493 --> 00:02:09.696
that felt fulfilled and grounded and clear.

49
00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:12.000
So then the question becomes how to actually do that.

50
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.823
So I engaged a lot of inquiries around it,

51
00:02:13.823 --> 00:02:17.121
and increasingly, the whole idea of putting together

52
00:02:17.121 --> 00:02:20.983
modern brain science, which is historically unprecedented,

53
00:02:20.983 --> 00:02:24.423
the explosion of information in that realm.

54
00:02:24.423 --> 00:02:26.568
Put that together with positive psychology,

55
00:02:26.568 --> 00:02:28.915
which has been 100 years old at least,

56
00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:30.938
certainly the last 30 to 40,

57
00:02:30.938 --> 00:02:33.200
and then put that together with thousands of years

58
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.800
of contemplative practice.

59
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.860
People hard-core training the mind.

60
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.037
They didn't have EEG's, they didn't know microscopes,

61
00:02:40.037 --> 00:02:41.412
they didn't have MRI's,

62
00:02:41.412 --> 00:02:43.780
but they knew they could do certain things

63
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.513
to activate these very reliable and profound states

64
00:02:47.513 --> 00:02:51.652
of well-being, love, and wisdom.

65
00:02:51.652 --> 00:02:55.172
What neuroscience can do is to reverse engineer.

66
00:02:55.172 --> 00:02:56.910
In other words, if you can start to understand

67
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.054
what's happening inside the brains of people

68
00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:00.899
when they're in a peak performance mode,

69
00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:01.968
or when they're really happy,

70
00:03:01.968 --> 00:03:04.676
or when they're working through some upset,

71
00:03:04.676 --> 00:03:06.874
or when they're snapping out of something, right?

72
00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:08.272
If you can understand what's going on

73
00:03:08.272 --> 00:03:10.053
in their brain when they're doing that,

74
00:03:10.053 --> 00:03:11.749
then you can work backwards and think,

75
00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:13.711
"Hmm, how can I use my mind?"

76
00:03:13.711 --> 00:03:14.574
Not drugs.

77
00:03:14.574 --> 00:03:18.852
"How can I use my mind alone to stimulate and strengthen

78
00:03:18.852 --> 00:03:21.314
"those underlying neural states that promote

79
00:03:21.314 --> 00:03:24.067
"the mental states I really care about?"

80
00:03:24.067 --> 00:03:26.606
And if you start learning how to do that,

81
00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:30.030
then you get the operating manual to the black box,

82
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.056
you know?
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

83
00:03:31.056 --> 00:03:33.113
<v Rick>The three pounds of tofu right between the ears</v>

84
00:03:33.113 --> 00:03:36.152
where it's all going on.

85
00:03:36.627 --> 00:03:38.610
Whatever is other than the transcendental,

86
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.870
that's a whole other matter.

87
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.885
But whatever's not transcendental

88
00:03:41.885 --> 00:03:43.944
it's produced inside the nervous system

89
00:03:43.944 --> 00:03:45.608
in terms of conscious experience,

90
00:03:45.608 --> 00:03:47.472
or unconscious experiences.

91
00:03:47.472 --> 00:03:48.806
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

92
00:03:48.806 --> 00:03:53.806
Let's talk about your definition of the difference between

93
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.461
the mind and the brain,

94
00:03:55.461 --> 00:04:00.165
and how the two are actually inextricably intertwined.

95
00:04:00.165 --> 00:04:03.493
<v ->Right, it's a fairly, I would say, conventional notion.</v>

96
00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:04.901
It's not radical.

97
00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:06.437
It's the idea that the brain is embedded

98
00:04:06.437 --> 00:04:07.460
in the nervous system.

99
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.453
So when I talk about the brain,

100
00:04:08.453 --> 00:04:10.436
I'm really talking about the nervous system,

101
00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:11.812
which is embedded in the body,

102
00:04:11.812 --> 00:04:13.337
intertwining with all these other systems,

103
00:04:13.337 --> 00:04:15.194
the immune system, the reproductive systems,

104
00:04:15.194 --> 00:04:16.495
all those systems.

105
00:04:16.495 --> 00:04:18.692
And then it's embedded in nature altogether,

106
00:04:18.692 --> 00:04:20.579
and in culture, across time.

107
00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.537
So in that broad, interdependent, interconnected view,

108
00:04:24.537 --> 00:04:26.435
which is very consistent with modern science

109
00:04:26.435 --> 00:04:30.241
both in terms of quantum physics, and deep ecology,

110
00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:32.835
as well as the post-modern view of culture.

111
00:04:32.835 --> 00:04:35.340
Inside all of that, this system,

112
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.962
now I'll just talk about the brain,

113
00:04:36.962 --> 00:04:38.423
moves information around.

114
00:04:38.423 --> 00:04:40.077
In other words, it sends signals.

115
00:04:40.077 --> 00:04:42.060
So the brain moves information around

116
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.237
like your heart moves blood around.

117
00:04:44.237 --> 00:04:46.741
And each little bit of information

118
00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:49.344
conveys meaning in some way.

119
00:04:49.344 --> 00:04:51.956
Now most of those meanings are at a very, very basic level,

120
00:04:51.956 --> 00:04:54.773
like tracking the amount of blood flow

121
00:04:54.773 --> 00:04:57.130
in the lower intestine, or something like that.

122
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.172
But layered up, increasingly higher and higher up,

123
00:05:01.172 --> 00:05:03.647
which also maps to how the brain evolved

124
00:05:03.647 --> 00:05:06.985
over evolutionary time, you know, 600 million years,

125
00:05:06.985 --> 00:05:10.472
roughly, of the evolution of the nervous system.

126
00:05:11.292 --> 00:05:13.757
At the higher levels, the brain is moving

127
00:05:13.757 --> 00:05:15.356
so much information around

128
00:05:15.356 --> 00:05:17.778
at such a sophisticated and integrated way,

129
00:05:17.778 --> 00:05:19.217
that we can actually have a sense

130
00:05:19.217 --> 00:05:21.876
of understanding each other right here and now.

131
00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:25.284
The net of it is that the mind, as I define it,

132
00:05:25.284 --> 00:05:28.206
is the flow of information through the nervous system.

133
00:05:28.206 --> 00:05:31.001
Most of that information is forever unconscious,

134
00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:34.040
but the two are intertwined, mind and brain,

135
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.101
in that as the brain changes, the mind changes.

136
00:05:37.101 --> 00:05:38.359
<v Regina>Yeah, let's talk about that,</v>

137
00:05:38.359 --> 00:05:41.260
how the mind also changes the brain.

138
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.260
<v ->Right, well, for example, just as information flows</v>

139
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.455
through the nervous system,

140
00:05:46.455 --> 00:05:48.042
'cause that's what the mind is,

141
00:05:48.042 --> 00:05:51.436
what that does is literally change the brain

142
00:05:51.436 --> 00:05:52.481
in a variety of ways.

143
00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:55.670
For example, parts of the brain that are more active

144
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.342
have more blood flow.

145
00:05:57.342 --> 00:06:00.137
Synapses that fire, or neurons that fire frequently

146
00:06:00.137 --> 00:06:02.675
become more sensitive to simulation.

147
00:06:02.675 --> 00:06:04.275
There's a famous saying in neurology,

148
00:06:04.275 --> 00:06:07.095
"Neurons that fire together wire together."

149
00:06:07.095 --> 00:06:09.073
It's pretty mechanical at a basic level.

150
00:06:09.073 --> 00:06:11.973
In other words, the more neurons that are firing,

151
00:06:11.973 --> 00:06:13.606
and the longer they're firing,

152
00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:15.504
and the more intensively they're firing,

153
00:06:15.504 --> 00:06:19.097
the better they get in terms of wiring together.

154
00:06:19.097 --> 00:06:21.571
Lots of really fun studies show this sort of thing.

155
00:06:21.571 --> 00:06:24.590
One of my favorite are taxi cab drivers in London.

156
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.070
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

157
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.395
<v ->They have to memorize the twisty, turny streets there.</v>

158
00:06:27.395 --> 00:06:29.325
They're hippocampus, a part of the brain

159
00:06:29.325 --> 00:06:32.206
that's involved in visual-spacial memory, is thicker.

160
00:06:32.206 --> 00:06:35.832
Literally, measurably thicker at the end of their training

161
00:06:35.832 --> 00:06:37.632
than it was at the beginning of their training,

162
00:06:37.632 --> 00:06:41.771
because all that mental activity of memorizing streets,

163
00:06:41.771 --> 00:06:44.715
has actually forged new neural structures.

164
00:06:44.715 --> 00:06:46.997
Now, a lot of us are not gonna drive a cab in London,

165
00:06:46.997 --> 00:06:48.928
so bringing it more to home,

166
00:06:48.928 --> 00:06:51.724
interesting studies of long-term meditators.

167
00:06:51.724 --> 00:06:56.649
For example, it looks very clear that two parts

168
00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:59.091
of the brain in particular get measurably thicker,

169
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:02.387
and strengthened, as it were, by frequent use.

170
00:07:02.387 --> 00:07:04.190
One part is called the insula,

171
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.490
that's a part of the brain that tracks

172
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.048
the internal state of the body,

173
00:07:07.048 --> 00:07:09.149
which kind of makes sense if you're following your breath,

174
00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:11.229
you're doing some kind of contemplative practice,

175
00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:13.448
you're gonna build out that part of your brain.

176
00:07:13.448 --> 00:07:17.448
The insula, though, also, really importantly, does empathy.

177
00:07:17.448 --> 00:07:19.773
It is a huge component of empathy,

178
00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:21.907
which is the simulation or tracking,

179
00:07:21.907 --> 00:07:24.604
or resonance with, the emotions of other people.

180
00:07:24.604 --> 00:07:27.455
We have these three, more or less, systems in the brain

181
00:07:27.455 --> 00:07:29.695
that track either the actions of other people,

182
00:07:29.695 --> 00:07:31.336
or the emotions of other people,

183
00:07:31.336 --> 00:07:33.641
or the thought processes of other people,

184
00:07:33.641 --> 00:07:34.996
all are really important,

185
00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:37.054
but obviously empathy is really central.

186
00:07:37.054 --> 00:07:39.748
So the way the insula works is that

187
00:07:39.748 --> 00:07:42.440
if I'm having emotion, particularly a primary emotion,

188
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.249
like sadness, or fear, or happiness,

189
00:07:46.239 --> 00:07:48.199
a lot of neurons light up there.

190
00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:51.665
When I watch you, let's say, having a similar emotion,

191
00:07:51.665 --> 00:07:54.118
some fraction of those same neurons light up

192
00:07:54.118 --> 00:07:56.220
in my insula as well.

193
00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.259
So I literally feel something from the inside out--

194
00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:00.443
<v Regina>Highly relational.</v>

195
00:08:00.443 --> 00:08:01.926
<v ->Of what it might be like to be you.</v>

196
00:08:01.926 --> 00:08:02.747
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>
<v Rick>Yeah.</v>

197
00:08:02.747 --> 00:08:05.478
So if by paying attention to your internal experience,

198
00:08:05.478 --> 00:08:08.623
which is a seemingly ephemeral, immaterial,

199
00:08:08.623 --> 00:08:12.136
mental activity, actually changes neural structure,

200
00:08:12.136 --> 00:08:14.290
that helps me be more in touch with myself

201
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:15.911
as well as more in touch with you.

202
00:08:15.911 --> 00:08:18.216
<v Regina>So interestingly when, say, for example,</v>

203
00:08:18.216 --> 00:08:21.191
you're taking a group of people,

204
00:08:21.191 --> 00:08:23.591
say a group of practicing Tibetan Buddhists,

205
00:08:23.591 --> 00:08:24.892
who are accustomed to meditating

206
00:08:24.892 --> 00:08:26.994
and spending time in meditation,

207
00:08:26.994 --> 00:08:29.648
that empathy that might be shown, say,

208
00:08:29.648 --> 00:08:31.149
en masse through that group then

209
00:08:31.149 --> 00:08:34.090
isn't necessarily one of a moral decision.

210
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:37.951
This has actually become hardwired

211
00:08:37.951 --> 00:08:40.874
as the stimulus to the insula, right?

212
00:08:40.874 --> 00:08:44.080
Or the development of the insula occurs?

213
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.327
<v ->Yes, we have these capabilities as human beings</v>

214
00:08:48.327 --> 00:08:50.607
to be deeply empathic.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

215
00:08:50.607 --> 00:08:53.427
<v Rick>There is a normal variation in terms of how</v>

216
00:08:53.427 --> 00:08:55.741
capable a person is, and then, of course,

217
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:57.705
there's a question of how they develop it.

218
00:08:57.705 --> 00:08:59.464
Then there are other complexities,

219
00:08:59.464 --> 00:09:03.346
because people who can be deeply empathic with us

220
00:09:03.346 --> 00:09:07.623
can also be viciously exploitive and dehumanizing to them.

221
00:09:07.623 --> 00:09:08.679
You see it all over the world.

222
00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:10.045
<v Regina>Right, so it's a hard wiring thing,</v>

223
00:09:10.045 --> 00:09:12.389
it's not necessarily a moral issue.

224
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:15.489
<v ->At that level, whether one uses those empathic capacities</v>

225
00:09:15.489 --> 00:09:17.346
to transcend the us, them distinction,

226
00:09:17.346 --> 00:09:19.766
which is big, a couple chapters in my book are about that,

227
00:09:19.766 --> 00:09:22.146
because I think that's a critical issue in the world today.

228
00:09:22.146 --> 00:09:24.512
We've got caveman brains in the 21st century

229
00:09:24.512 --> 00:09:25.804
armed with nuclear weapons.

230
00:09:25.804 --> 00:09:26.347
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

231
00:09:26.347 --> 00:09:27.744
<v ->You know, we really need to work on this</v>

232
00:09:27.744 --> 00:09:28.865
us, them dichotomy,

233
00:09:28.865 --> 00:09:31.628
because as soon as you mark that distinction

234
00:09:31.628 --> 00:09:33.388
between us and them,

235
00:09:33.388 --> 00:09:35.871
you immediately start activating fearful aggression.

236
00:09:35.871 --> 00:09:37.770
It starts warming up those circuits.

237
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.949
They don't necessarily take action yet,

238
00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:42.272
but they're getting primed.

239
00:09:42.272 --> 00:09:46.090
And then as soon as you start to feel threatened via them,

240
00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:49.685
the wolf of hate gets up and starts snarling and biting.

241
00:09:49.685 --> 00:09:50.624
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

242
00:09:50.624 --> 00:09:53.041
<v ->So the point here is that there is</v>

243
00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:56.582
an intertwining necessity to have both the capacity

244
00:09:56.582 --> 00:09:58.267
to resonate with other people,

245
00:09:58.267 --> 00:10:00.166
as well as the moral intention.

246
00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:03.451
<v Regina>Which is, that's the desirable combination.</v>

247
00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:05.082
But it's interesting what you just mentioned

248
00:10:05.082 --> 00:10:05.905
about the empathy.

249
00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:10.082
For example, excuse me. (coughing)

250
00:10:11.162 --> 00:10:13.722
Go ahead, anyone else need to cough? (laughing)

251
00:10:13.722 --> 00:10:15.728
It's our little cough break.

252
00:10:15.728 --> 00:10:18.771
Okay, so what you were just speaking about,

253
00:10:18.771 --> 00:10:20.252
might this be an example of it?

254
00:10:20.252 --> 00:10:22.312
If you have someone who is an empath

255
00:10:22.312 --> 00:10:24.349
and understands what motivates the feelings

256
00:10:24.349 --> 00:10:25.991
of themselves and others,

257
00:10:25.991 --> 00:10:29.533
say to skew that and use it in a very highly manipulative,

258
00:10:29.533 --> 00:10:31.133
say marketing campaign,

259
00:10:31.133 --> 00:10:33.373
that might not be for the highest and best good,

260
00:10:33.373 --> 00:10:37.974
that would be, as you say, nuclear weapons in the brain.

261
00:10:38.574 --> 00:10:39.991
<v ->Exactly right, exactly right.</v>

262
00:10:39.991 --> 00:10:41.363
There's no, it's interesting,

263
00:10:42.483 --> 00:10:44.261
the book's titled Buddha's Brain.

264
00:10:44.851 --> 00:10:48.620
In some ways it's an investigation of Buddhism

265
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.130
in terms of evolutionary neuropsychology.

266
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.734
In other words, grounding this ancient tradition of wisdom

267
00:10:54.734 --> 00:10:58.677
that began 2,500 years ago in terms of

268
00:10:58.677 --> 00:11:00.553
what modern science has to say,

269
00:11:00.553 --> 00:11:03.711
which, very interestingly, does not disagree

270
00:11:03.711 --> 00:11:06.675
with Buddhist psychology in any fundamental particular.

271
00:11:06.675 --> 00:11:07.839
<v Regina>Right.</v>

272
00:11:07.839 --> 00:11:09.684
<v ->Buddhist cosmology is sort of outside the frame</v>

273
00:11:09.684 --> 00:11:12.520
of western science, western science can't say either way,

274
00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.764
they're just outside their frame.

275
00:11:13.764 --> 00:11:16.288
But in terms of how the mind actually works,

276
00:11:16.288 --> 00:11:17.782
and what leads to suffering,

277
00:11:17.782 --> 00:11:19.947
or what leads to freedom from suffering,

278
00:11:19.947 --> 00:11:22.923
modern science, modern neuropsychology,

279
00:11:22.923 --> 00:11:26.006
and Buddhist contemplative psychology

280
00:11:26.006 --> 00:11:28.224
just fit together like hand and glove.

281
00:11:28.224 --> 00:11:31.243
So in that psychology it's interesting that

282
00:11:31.243 --> 00:11:33.579
there are these three pillars of practice in Buddhism:

283
00:11:33.579 --> 00:11:35.433
Virtue, mindfulness, and wisdom.

284
00:11:35.433 --> 00:11:37.797
Mindfulness is sometimes translated to concentration,

285
00:11:37.797 --> 00:11:39.845
being able to study and absorb the mind.

286
00:11:39.845 --> 00:11:42.203
It's very interesting that there's no replacement

287
00:11:42.203 --> 00:11:44.037
for one of those three pillars of practice.

288
00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:45.317
It's a three-legged stool.

289
00:11:45.317 --> 00:11:47.225
You can't have just mindfulness and wisdom,

290
00:11:47.225 --> 00:11:48.644
you also need virtue.

291
00:11:48.644 --> 00:11:51.045
You also need a moral intelligence

292
00:11:51.045 --> 00:11:53.944
of valuing, of being principled, and being restrained.

293
00:11:53.944 --> 00:11:57.364
And it's interesting that those three functions correspond

294
00:11:57.364 --> 00:12:01.352
to, very closely, actually, to three fundamental functions

295
00:12:01.352 --> 00:12:03.719
of the nervous system, right?

296
00:12:03.719 --> 00:12:06.055
To regulate, that sounds like virtue.

297
00:12:06.055 --> 00:12:09.052
To learn, that sounds like where we place our attention

298
00:12:09.052 --> 00:12:10.458
in terms of mindfulness.

299
00:12:10.458 --> 00:12:12.934
And to select, which sounds like wisdom,

300
00:12:12.934 --> 00:12:16.091
which boils down to, essentially, giving up lesser rewards

301
00:12:16.091 --> 00:12:17.457
for greater ones.

302
00:12:17.457 --> 00:12:20.710
<v Regina>Right, and not necessarily immediate rewards.</v>

303
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:21.658
<v ->Right, exactly right.</v>

304
00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:23.291
<v Regina>Where that's a different portion of the brain.</v>

305
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:24.745
<v ->Yeah, seeing of the big picture.</v>

306
00:12:24.745 --> 00:12:26.420
<v Regina>Yes. (laughing)</v>
<v Rick>Exactly right.</v>

307
00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.902
<v Rick>But it's so marvelous</v>
<v Regina>It is!</v>

308
00:12:27.902 --> 00:12:31.561
<v Rick>to see that these voices speaking to us</v>

309
00:12:31.561 --> 00:12:36.074
from the dusty plains of northern India 2,500 years ago,

310
00:12:36.074 --> 00:12:39.548
and along the way people in all cultures around the world

311
00:12:39.548 --> 00:12:44.326
actually are resonant with, and consistent with,

312
00:12:44.326 --> 00:12:48.266
and confirmed by the most sophisticated discoveries

313
00:12:48.266 --> 00:12:50.725
of the last few years of modern science.

314
00:12:51.355 --> 00:12:52.539
<v Regina>And one place you take it</v>

315
00:12:52.539 --> 00:12:55.408
that I find very interesting is that you're saying,

316
00:12:55.408 --> 00:12:57.968
and this again has to be from your exploration

317
00:12:57.968 --> 00:12:59.420
in all of these disciplines,

318
00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.363
including Buddhism and meditation,

319
00:13:02.363 --> 00:13:06.086
is that, you're saying that our innate nature,

320
00:13:06.086 --> 00:13:08.527
if we can quiet these systems and put them in balance,

321
00:13:08.527 --> 00:13:13.286
that the innate nature of humanity is goodness and love.

322
00:13:13.286 --> 00:13:14.845
<v ->Absolutely true.</v>

323
00:13:17.241 --> 00:13:19.458
I talk about it as the five C's.

324
00:13:20.058 --> 00:13:22.977
I think through evolution, and just simply thinking

325
00:13:22.977 --> 00:13:25.697
in terms purely of the body and psychology,

326
00:13:25.697 --> 00:13:28.555
without resorting to anything religious, if you will,

327
00:13:28.555 --> 00:13:31.457
that humans are conscious,

328
00:13:31.457 --> 00:13:33.483
it's really hard to make a brain unconscious.

329
00:13:33.483 --> 00:13:36.704
You have to hit it hard, you have to knock it out,

330
00:13:36.704 --> 00:13:38.080
even when we're sleeping there's a lot

331
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.637
of conscious activity going on.

332
00:13:39.637 --> 00:13:41.675
As you know, if you're suddenly awakened, you know,

333
00:13:41.675 --> 00:13:43.797
you can recall the last few seconds, at least,

334
00:13:43.797 --> 00:13:45.342
of conscious activity.

335
00:13:45.342 --> 00:13:49.119
Second, we're calm, the resting state, our home base,

336
00:13:49.119 --> 00:13:51.498
is activation of what's called

337
00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:53.397
the parasympathetic nervous system.

338
00:13:53.397 --> 00:13:55.302
In other words, when we're not angry,

339
00:13:55.302 --> 00:13:57.262
or upset, or hungry, or in pain,

340
00:13:57.262 --> 00:13:59.906
or chemically disturbed, there's a calm.

341
00:13:59.906 --> 00:14:01.875
Third, we're contented.

342
00:14:01.875 --> 00:14:04.297
The basic resting state people default to

343
00:14:04.297 --> 00:14:06.098
is mild sense of contentment.

344
00:14:06.098 --> 00:14:09.237
You know, which mild being a very wonderful sense,

345
00:14:09.237 --> 00:14:10.663
of kind of ease of mind.

346
00:14:10.663 --> 00:14:11.966
Fourth, we're caring.

347
00:14:11.966 --> 00:14:13.982
We evolved to be very caring.

348
00:14:13.982 --> 00:14:16.852
Arguably, the development of caringness,

349
00:14:16.852 --> 00:14:18.855
and the skills that enable it,

350
00:14:18.855 --> 00:14:20.678
are what drove the evolution of the brain

351
00:14:20.678 --> 00:14:22.417
over the last hundred million years,

352
00:14:22.417 --> 00:14:24.753
literally in three steps, I can talk about that in a moment,

353
00:14:24.753 --> 00:14:28.316
but three steps in terms of vertebrate evolution,

354
00:14:28.316 --> 00:14:30.876
then primates, then humans, so caring.

355
00:14:30.876 --> 00:14:33.424
And then last, we're creative, we're very generative.

356
00:14:33.424 --> 00:14:35.856
There's a generativity in the nervous system.

357
00:14:35.856 --> 00:14:38.502
That's our home base, that is our home base.

358
00:14:38.502 --> 00:14:39.376
But the problem is--

359
00:14:39.376 --> 00:14:40.102
<v Regina>Yeah, I was gonna say,</v>

360
00:14:40.102 --> 00:14:41.157
my next question is
<v Rick>To evolve,</v>

361
00:14:41.157 --> 00:14:43.940
<v Rick>we are able to be driven from home</v>

362
00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:48.016
at the snap of a twig, or the cough of a leopard nearby.

363
00:14:48.016 --> 00:14:51.354
<v Regina>And we tend to, now, in this time,</v>

364
00:14:51.354 --> 00:14:54.575
for a variety of reasons, many people are stuck

365
00:14:54.575 --> 00:14:57.402
in this sympathetic nervous system overdrive.

366
00:14:57.402 --> 00:14:58.138
<v ->Right.</v>

367
00:14:58.138 --> 00:15:00.036
<v Regina>And so we can't recognize a lot of those</v>

368
00:15:00.036 --> 00:15:04.196
native, or inherent, traits, day in and day out

369
00:15:04.196 --> 00:15:06.339
that you just spoke about.

370
00:15:06.339 --> 00:15:08.079
Let's talk about how that happens.

371
00:15:08.079 --> 00:15:09.902
Let's talk about the nervous system a little bit,

372
00:15:09.902 --> 00:15:11.876
how we get stuck in that overdrive,

373
00:15:11.876 --> 00:15:14.340
and basically suppress the parasympathetic nervous system,

374
00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.711
and what the implications of that are.

375
00:15:17.593 --> 00:15:20.238
<v ->We evolved to handle bursts of stress,</v>

376
00:15:20.238 --> 00:15:21.560
and there's a place for them.

377
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.014
And we evolved to handle bursts of excitement,

378
00:15:24.014 --> 00:15:26.179
there's a place for those too.

379
00:15:26.179 --> 00:15:30.879
We did not evolve to have chronic, medium-grade stress,

380
00:15:30.879 --> 00:15:35.134
which is the lot of most people in the modern world.

381
00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:36.872
The result of that, as you well know,

382
00:15:36.872 --> 00:15:41.872
is, basically is toxic to both the body and the mind.

383
00:15:42.779 --> 00:15:45.423
In other words, chronic stress wears on the immune system,

384
00:15:45.423 --> 00:15:48.676
the gastrointestinal system, the cardiovascular system,

385
00:15:48.676 --> 00:15:52.268
it's depressing, and so forth.

386
00:15:52.838 --> 00:15:53.945
Part of the problem, though,

387
00:15:53.945 --> 00:15:56.805
is that the sympathetic nervous system evolved

388
00:15:56.805 --> 00:16:00.442
to go into gear immediately, because that's what we need

389
00:16:00.442 --> 00:16:03.332
to run away from that leopard, you know, in the bushes.

390
00:16:03.332 --> 00:16:05.933
Or to chase after that opportunity that we suddenly see,

391
00:16:05.933 --> 00:16:07.621
some prey we can go eat,

392
00:16:07.621 --> 00:16:09.946
and bring home to our family, if you will.

393
00:16:09.946 --> 00:16:11.888
On the other hand, the sympathetic nervous system

394
00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:14.789
wears off really, really slowly, because what it does is,

395
00:16:14.789 --> 00:16:17.670
it intertwines with the endocrine system, the hormones,

396
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.834
which lead to stress hormone releases,

397
00:16:19.834 --> 00:16:21.370
like adrenaline and cortisol.

398
00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.535
They take a long time to metabolize.

399
00:16:23.535 --> 00:16:25.050
Have you ever had the experience where you thought

400
00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:28.298
something awful was going to happen, or had happened,

401
00:16:28.298 --> 00:16:30.816
and then you discovered that it was really all fine?

402
00:16:30.816 --> 00:16:34.240
And yet your body's still rattled three, four hours later?

403
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.682
That's the result of, you know, the residues

404
00:16:36.682 --> 00:16:39.403
of the sympathetic release is still in the blood stream.

405
00:16:39.403 --> 00:16:41.846
So the net of it is that we are in a state

406
00:16:41.846 --> 00:16:43.702
of chronic sympathetic overload.

407
00:16:43.702 --> 00:16:46.228
And also this is a culture that's addicted on stimulation.

408
00:16:46.228 --> 00:16:46.624
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

409
00:16:46.624 --> 00:16:48.006
<v ->It's kind of an ADD culture.</v>

410
00:16:48.006 --> 00:16:50.277
It's kind of funny, my kids will watch a movie

411
00:16:50.277 --> 00:16:52.913
that was made in the '70's or the '80's,

412
00:16:52.913 --> 00:16:54.352
not that long ago.
<v Regina>Boring!</v>

413
00:16:54.352 --> 00:16:55.877
<v Rick>Exactly! It's too slow!</v>

414
00:16:55.877 --> 00:16:56.517
<v Regina>Too slow.</v>

415
00:16:56.517 --> 00:16:58.555
<v ->Where as my dad, who's very sharp,</v>

416
00:16:58.555 --> 00:17:01.434
retired college professor, 91, still really sharp,

417
00:17:01.434 --> 00:17:04.154
he can't watch a modern movie 'cause it's just too fast.

418
00:17:04.154 --> 00:17:06.213
There are cuts every two to three seconds.

419
00:17:06.213 --> 00:17:08.592
But that's what we get habituated to.

420
00:17:08.592 --> 00:17:10.874
I think of it as a kind of trance, you know?

421
00:17:10.874 --> 00:17:14.468
I think that we're in a paranoid trance these days.

422
00:17:14.468 --> 00:17:18.629
We're very threat sensitive as humans

423
00:17:18.629 --> 00:17:20.666
at the top of the food chain.

424
00:17:20.666 --> 00:17:23.618
Our ancestors that were all mellow, and trusted everyone,

425
00:17:23.618 --> 00:17:25.378
(scratching) they got the chop.

426
00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:28.702
But our ancestors that were nervous, and cranky,

427
00:17:28.702 --> 00:17:31.998
anxious and cranky, they passed on a lot of gene copies,

428
00:17:31.998 --> 00:17:34.903
and we're walking around as those gene copies today.

429
00:17:34.903 --> 00:17:37.966
So understanding how we're hardwired to be paranoid

430
00:17:37.966 --> 00:17:39.182
in the first place,

431
00:17:39.182 --> 00:17:41.859
and then we live in a world where, with modern media,

432
00:17:41.859 --> 00:17:44.395
and being also in sympathetic overdrive,

433
00:17:44.395 --> 00:17:46.348
and then manipulated by governmental forces

434
00:17:46.348 --> 00:17:49.995
that jack up the threat profile to then have

435
00:17:49.995 --> 00:17:53.014
a willing and subordinate populous.

436
00:17:53.584 --> 00:17:57.885
That results in, of course, a lot of ongoing,

437
00:17:57.885 --> 00:18:01.498
low-grade fear, fear of the future, fear of the world,

438
00:18:01.498 --> 00:18:04.623
fear of threat level orange any time you go to an airport,

439
00:18:04.623 --> 00:18:07.322
even though the threat on that day at that airport

440
00:18:07.322 --> 00:18:09.943
is probably bright green, actually.

441
00:18:10.523 --> 00:18:13.225
That leads us also to treat other people badly,

442
00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:14.569
'cause as soon as we feel threatened,

443
00:18:14.569 --> 00:18:16.969
we're very ready to get very reactive.

444
00:18:16.969 --> 00:18:20.190
So for me the corrective is to understand it.

445
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:22.665
I mean, the book I wrote is mostly practical tools,

446
00:18:22.665 --> 00:18:24.244
because that's what I'm really interested in.

447
00:18:24.244 --> 00:18:26.249
I'm a methods guy, I synthesize things,

448
00:18:26.249 --> 00:18:26.985
and I apply them--

449
00:18:26.985 --> 00:18:29.790
<v Regina>And the thing is, it's very approachable</v>

450
00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:31.187
for anybody.
<v Rick>Oh, thank you.</v>

451
00:18:31.187 --> 00:18:32.510
<v Regina>You've written it in a way that,</v>

452
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:34.782
it's very easy to digest and take on

453
00:18:34.782 --> 00:18:36.989
if you wish to go this direction, yes?

454
00:18:36.989 --> 00:18:38.630
<v ->Yeah, I think if you get something clearly</v>

455
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:40.230
you can explain it clearly.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

456
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:41.648
<v Rick>And so if you're not explaining it clearly,</v>

457
00:18:41.648 --> 00:18:43.526
there's a decent chance you don't get it clearly.

458
00:18:43.526 --> 00:18:44.901
So I try to get it clearly

459
00:18:44.901 --> 00:18:46.309
and then I can explain it clearly.

460
00:18:46.309 --> 00:18:48.763
But the take away point is that if we're in

461
00:18:48.763 --> 00:18:51.141
this paranoid trance much of the time,

462
00:18:51.141 --> 00:18:55.002
it's really useful to put in correction factors.

463
00:18:55.002 --> 00:18:57.423
To calm the body down with various practices

464
00:18:57.423 --> 00:18:59.293
that activate the parasympathetic nervous system

465
00:18:59.293 --> 00:19:00.754
and settle us down.

466
00:19:00.754 --> 00:19:03.196
To tap into feelings of being strong,

467
00:19:03.196 --> 00:19:05.458
which help you feel safer.

468
00:19:05.458 --> 00:19:09.158
To realize that you are safe, do the cognitive work.

469
00:19:09.158 --> 00:19:11.633
And then especially to connect with other people

470
00:19:11.633 --> 00:19:13.895
in this empathic and resonant way.

471
00:19:13.895 --> 00:19:17.115
All of those things lower the paranoia,

472
00:19:17.115 --> 00:19:19.313
wake us up from this nightmare

473
00:19:19.313 --> 00:19:20.933
of being threatened all the time,

474
00:19:20.933 --> 00:19:23.398
and then help us take much better care of ourselves

475
00:19:23.398 --> 00:19:24.496
and other people.

476
00:19:24.496 --> 00:19:25.798
<v Regina>And these are practices,</v>

477
00:19:25.798 --> 00:19:28.571
and you lay each one of these out in the book,

478
00:19:28.571 --> 00:19:31.813
I think, again, in a very simple to understand way.

479
00:19:31.813 --> 00:19:34.821
But, let's go back just a moment,

480
00:19:34.821 --> 00:19:37.861
before we start talking about some of these exercises

481
00:19:37.861 --> 00:19:39.961
we can work with, and back to what I was saying

482
00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:42.778
in the very beginning where my son's girlfriend, Stephanie,

483
00:19:42.778 --> 00:19:46.095
is saying, "I know, I just need to snap out of it."

484
00:19:46.095 --> 00:19:49.721
Let's talk about why that is easier said than done.

485
00:19:49.721 --> 00:19:51.673
Why is it we can't just make our mind up?

486
00:19:51.673 --> 00:19:54.310
"I am not going to behave that way anymore, that's it."

487
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:55.897
But then we disappoint ourselves

488
00:19:55.897 --> 00:19:59.212
maybe minutes or hours later.

489
00:19:59.982 --> 00:20:02.375
<v ->Well a couple things on that, it's interesting,</v>

490
00:20:02.375 --> 00:20:04.541
I've been a therapist for a really long time,

491
00:20:04.541 --> 00:20:06.940
and it's had two big effects.

492
00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.223
One is that it's made me a lot more compassionate,

493
00:20:09.223 --> 00:20:11.377
to really appreciate the forces that are bearing down

494
00:20:11.377 --> 00:20:13.574
on people and at work in their lives.

495
00:20:13.574 --> 00:20:17.383
I think about the quote, unquote, "10,000 causes upstream."

496
00:20:17.383 --> 00:20:18.950
And that's, by the way, a really useful way

497
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:20.989
to deal with a difficult person,

498
00:20:20.989 --> 00:20:22.291
to just kind of be aware,

499
00:20:22.291 --> 00:20:24.530
or think about some of the 10,000 causes

500
00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:26.139
that are leading them to bump into you

501
00:20:26.139 --> 00:20:27.932
right here and right now.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

502
00:20:27.932 --> 00:20:28.666
<v Rick>The other thing it's made me</v>

503
00:20:28.666 --> 00:20:30.817
is much more tough-minded.

504
00:20:30.817 --> 00:20:32.105
You know, the joke about how many therapists

505
00:20:32.105 --> 00:20:33.705
it takes to change a light bulb?

506
00:20:33.705 --> 00:20:35.005
<v Regina>I don't think I've heard that one.</v>

507
00:20:35.005 --> 00:20:36.083
<v ->Only one.</v>

508
00:20:36.083 --> 00:20:36.777
<v Regina>Only one? (laughing)</v>

509
00:20:36.777 --> 00:20:38.205
<v ->But the light bulb has to want to change.</v>

510
00:20:38.205 --> 00:20:38.878
<v Regina>There you go.</v>

511
00:20:38.878 --> 00:20:39.560
<v ->That's good.</v>

512
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.244
It's lame, but profound.
<v Regina>It can't be stuck.</v>

513
00:20:41.244 --> 00:20:42.600
<v Rick>And so I see a lot of people</v>

514
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.883
who don't snap out of it 'cause deep down

515
00:20:44.883 --> 00:20:47.699
they don't want to snap out of it, first off.

516
00:20:47.699 --> 00:20:48.520
So number one--

517
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.214
<v Regina>Is that because they're physically,</v>

518
00:20:50.214 --> 00:20:52.869
neurologically, addicted to that pattern?

519
00:20:52.869 --> 00:20:54.683
<v ->It could be, it could also be that it's rewarding</v>

520
00:20:54.683 --> 00:20:56.068
for them or honestly,

521
00:20:56.068 --> 00:20:57.252
the deep level.
<v Regina>In a negative way.</v>

522
00:20:57.252 --> 00:20:58.947
<v Rick>They could be afraid of what will come their way</v>

523
00:20:58.947 --> 00:21:00.515
if they do snap out of it.

524
00:21:00.515 --> 00:21:02.802
There are a lot of reasons, and many of them are completely

525
00:21:02.802 --> 00:21:04.374
below the water line.

526
00:21:04.374 --> 00:21:07.456
But I think one part is to definitely, you know,

527
00:21:07.456 --> 00:21:09.569
think about what is your true intention.

528
00:21:09.569 --> 00:21:11.553
Now, more to your question though,

529
00:21:11.553 --> 00:21:13.334
what are the tendencies that keep drawing us

530
00:21:13.334 --> 00:21:14.529
in a certain direction?

531
00:21:14.529 --> 00:21:17.429
You're absolutely right, I mean, they're very embedded

532
00:21:17.429 --> 00:21:19.051
in the nervous system.

533
00:21:19.051 --> 00:21:21.129
Learning has occurred.

534
00:21:21.129 --> 00:21:24.264
People get upset as a way to cope,

535
00:21:24.264 --> 00:21:29.264
so if they're not, if they let go of that way of coping,

536
00:21:29.458 --> 00:21:32.212
they better replace it with another way of coping.

537
00:21:32.212 --> 00:21:34.999
I find, for myself, I do this kind of little,

538
00:21:34.999 --> 00:21:37.057
mini first-aid thing, which is actually not in the book,

539
00:21:37.057 --> 00:21:39.731
so this is a special super-duper tip.

540
00:21:40.741 --> 00:21:43.578
Pause, before you do anything, pause.

541
00:21:44.168 --> 00:21:47.485
How often do we make mistakes by not saying something

542
00:21:47.485 --> 00:21:50.553
versus how often do we make mistakes by saying something

543
00:21:50.553 --> 00:21:51.939
and regretting it later?
<v Regina>Very true.</v>

544
00:21:51.939 --> 00:21:55.215
<v Rick>Okay, second, have compassion for your suffering.</v>

545
00:21:55.215 --> 00:21:58.372
Like right then and there, your son's girlfriend,

546
00:21:58.372 --> 00:22:00.237
to start with self-compassion.

547
00:22:00.237 --> 00:22:02.179
There's a lot of research these days

548
00:22:02.179 --> 00:22:04.174
about the power of self-compassion,

549
00:22:04.174 --> 00:22:05.550
which is something I include in the book,

550
00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:09.038
and how to activate it in neurologically clever ways,

551
00:22:09.038 --> 00:22:10.691
because a lot of people have a hard time

552
00:22:10.691 --> 00:22:12.516
being compassionate for themselves.

553
00:22:12.516 --> 00:22:14.733
One of the tricks is to bring to mind

554
00:22:14.733 --> 00:22:16.152
the felt sense of being with someone

555
00:22:16.152 --> 00:22:17.709
who really cares about you.

556
00:22:17.709 --> 00:22:18.669
It could be a pet,

557
00:22:18.669 --> 00:22:20.674
it could be someone who's no longer alive,

558
00:22:20.674 --> 00:22:22.594
it could be a spirit, whatever it is,

559
00:22:22.594 --> 00:22:24.077
it could be your mate these days.

560
00:22:24.077 --> 00:22:25.271
To bring that to mind really can

561
00:22:25.271 --> 00:22:27.212
take you to self-compassion.

562
00:22:27.212 --> 00:22:29.772
The third thing is to get on your own side.

563
00:22:29.772 --> 00:22:32.428
That again is something where I've gotten more tough-minded.

564
00:22:32.428 --> 00:22:34.593
I see a lot of people who are not on their own side,

565
00:22:34.593 --> 00:22:36.556
and if you're not gonna be on your own side,

566
00:22:36.556 --> 00:22:37.814
who's gonna be on your side?

567
00:22:37.814 --> 00:22:38.870
<v Regina>Again, all these messages that your--</v>

568
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:39.948
<v ->The Rabbi hello quote.</v>

569
00:22:39.948 --> 00:22:41.974
<v Regina>You're flawed, you're a flawed human being.</v>

570
00:22:41.974 --> 00:22:43.969
This is, again, the manipulation that's occurring

571
00:22:43.969 --> 00:22:46.499
from the outside perpetually.

572
00:22:46.499 --> 00:22:47.299
<v ->I know.</v>

573
00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:48.739
<v Regina>From all systems, you're flawed,</v>

574
00:22:48.739 --> 00:22:50.724
you're not enough.
<v Rick>That's right.</v>

575
00:22:50.724 --> 00:22:52.030
But if you get on your own side,

576
00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.550
you start recognizing those,

577
00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:56.312
and you start having the capacity to separate

578
00:22:56.312 --> 00:22:58.038
and distance from, that's where mindfulness

579
00:22:58.038 --> 00:22:59.734
is really, really useful.

580
00:22:59.734 --> 00:23:02.294
To separate from those thoughts.

581
00:23:02.294 --> 00:23:04.575
Then increasingly you look at them literally

582
00:23:04.575 --> 00:23:08.672
as almost invaders, or afflictions, upon yourself,

583
00:23:08.672 --> 00:23:13.005
that it's not good for me to have the thought that

584
00:23:13.005 --> 00:23:15.902
I am not allowed to snap out of it, right?

585
00:23:15.902 --> 00:23:18.163
And because, but if I'm not on my own side,

586
00:23:18.163 --> 00:23:22.803
which usually needs a foundation of compassion and pausing,

587
00:23:22.803 --> 00:23:25.501
if I'm not on my own side it won't mean anything to me,

588
00:23:25.501 --> 00:23:28.060
it won't matter to me, that I'm now recognizing that

589
00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.183
that thought is bad for me.

590
00:23:30.183 --> 00:23:31.720
So I've got to be on my own side.

591
00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.120
And then, make a plan, take action.

592
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.882
<v Regina>Yet there is another factor embedded</v>

593
00:23:36.882 --> 00:23:38.407
within all of this that you write about,

594
00:23:38.407 --> 00:23:41.606
which is very simple to grasp, and that is,

595
00:23:41.606 --> 00:23:44.060
basically bad news sticks like Teflon,

596
00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.567
the negative sticks like Teflon to the brain.

597
00:23:46.567 --> 00:23:49.564
And the positive slides, I mean, like Velcro,

598
00:23:49.564 --> 00:23:50.663
negative and Velcro,
<v Rick>There you go.</v>

599
00:23:50.663 --> 00:23:51.761
<v Regina>and then the good news</v>

600
00:23:51.761 --> 00:23:53.724
kind of slips off like Teflon.

601
00:23:53.724 --> 00:23:57.265
What is it in us that makes that the natural hierarchy

602
00:23:57.265 --> 00:24:00.241
that we more quickly attune to the negative

603
00:24:00.241 --> 00:24:02.454
than the positive?
<v Rick>Right.</v>

604
00:24:03.504 --> 00:24:04.723
<v Rick>One of the most interesting part of the book</v>

605
00:24:04.723 --> 00:24:06.909
for me to write was why do we suffer?

606
00:24:06.909 --> 00:24:08.903
So, if you think about it, it's a pretty important question,

607
00:24:08.903 --> 00:24:10.323
why do we actually suffer?

608
00:24:10.323 --> 00:24:15.048
And how is it that we evolved to suffer, in effect?

609
00:24:15.048 --> 00:24:17.789
And one of the considerations there is to realize

610
00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:20.488
that we have these three fundamental systems, basically,

611
00:24:20.488 --> 00:24:22.610
in the brain that direct us.

612
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:24.487
One is to approach the pleasant.

613
00:24:24.487 --> 00:24:27.992
The second one is to avoid the unpleasant.

614
00:24:27.992 --> 00:24:32.656
And the third one is to affiliate, or attach, to loved ones.

615
00:24:32.656 --> 00:24:36.538
Crocodiles, snakes, and sharks have the first two systems.

616
00:24:36.538 --> 00:24:38.992
Only birds, and mammals, and especially primates,

617
00:24:38.992 --> 00:24:41.508
and especially humans, have that third system,

618
00:24:41.508 --> 00:24:43.194
which is about attachment.

619
00:24:43.194 --> 00:24:44.816
In terms of the first two, though,

620
00:24:44.816 --> 00:24:46.010
if we just think about it,

621
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:48.271
and they get used in the service of attachment,

622
00:24:48.271 --> 00:24:50.031
you know, we want to approach carrots

623
00:24:50.031 --> 00:24:51.673
and dodge sticks, right?

624
00:24:51.673 --> 00:24:52.931
Both are important.

625
00:24:52.931 --> 00:24:54.596
The thing, though, is in evolution,

626
00:24:54.596 --> 00:24:56.452
if you miss a carrot today,

627
00:24:56.452 --> 00:24:58.969
you'll probably have a chance at a carrot tomorrow.

628
00:24:58.969 --> 00:25:02.596
Fail to dodge that stick today, whap!

629
00:25:02.596 --> 00:25:04.749
You know, no chance at a carrot tomorrow.

630
00:25:04.749 --> 00:25:06.553
So we have evolved what's called in science

631
00:25:06.553 --> 00:25:08.089
a negativity bias.

632
00:25:08.089 --> 00:25:12.247
The brain is biased toward looking for negative information,

633
00:25:12.247 --> 00:25:15.950
reacting to it, storing it, and then retrieving it

634
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:19.023
at the drop of a hat, you know, or the crack of a twig.

635
00:25:19.663 --> 00:25:21.910
Therefore it is, as you said quoting me,

636
00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:24.353
it's like Velcro for negative experiences,

637
00:25:24.353 --> 00:25:25.868
but Teflon for positive ones.

638
00:25:25.868 --> 00:25:27.936
We can remember positive experiences,

639
00:25:27.936 --> 00:25:30.273
and when I say remember, key point here,

640
00:25:30.273 --> 00:25:33.014
it's not so much the explicit, what's called explicit memory

641
00:25:33.014 --> 00:25:35.712
for a specific recollections of events,

642
00:25:35.712 --> 00:25:37.728
but rather the lived residue,

643
00:25:37.728 --> 00:25:41.291
the slow sifting down into us of the residue

644
00:25:41.291 --> 00:25:43.753
of experience in implicit memory.

645
00:25:43.753 --> 00:25:45.518
That's where the action really is,

646
00:25:45.518 --> 00:25:48.701
particularly in terms of mood, resilience,

647
00:25:48.701 --> 00:25:52.679
optimism, confidence, happiness, sense of ourselves,

648
00:25:52.679 --> 00:25:54.642
you know, learned reactions to the world,

649
00:25:54.642 --> 00:25:55.964
that's what we really care about.

650
00:25:55.964 --> 00:25:57.703
That's all implicit memory.

651
00:25:57.703 --> 00:25:59.538
Well, as we go through life, you know,

652
00:25:59.538 --> 00:26:02.843
99 good things happen, they go right through the sieve.

653
00:26:02.843 --> 00:26:06.460
One bad thing happens (clicking) it's caught and tracked.

654
00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:09.617
And what you then have is a gradual tilting over time

655
00:26:09.617 --> 00:26:12.220
toward the negative in implicit memory.

656
00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.798
The way to remedy that, number one,

657
00:26:13.798 --> 00:26:15.899
is to appreciate the power of it,

658
00:26:15.899 --> 00:26:18.961
and to realize, in a sense, you know,

659
00:26:18.961 --> 00:26:20.496
I sleep with the enemy every night

660
00:26:20.496 --> 00:26:21.617
between my ears.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

661
00:26:21.617 --> 00:26:22.874
<v Regina>We're hardwired, we're hardwired toward it.</v>

662
00:26:22.874 --> 00:26:23.760
<v ->Yeah, we're hardwired to do it,</v>

663
00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:24.933
that's where compassion comes in,

664
00:26:24.933 --> 00:26:27.397
that's one of those 10,000 causes upstream and all the rest.

665
00:26:27.397 --> 00:26:29.136
But then, take up arms against it,

666
00:26:29.136 --> 00:26:30.693
take up arms against our oppressors.

667
00:26:30.693 --> 00:26:32.933
In other words, be on our own side,

668
00:26:32.933 --> 00:26:34.394
be a hammer, not a nail,

669
00:26:34.394 --> 00:26:36.698
that's a critically important thing for people in life,

670
00:26:36.698 --> 00:26:38.373
and that's, for me, one of the really great things

671
00:26:38.373 --> 00:26:41.359
about this book, the idea that you can be, at cause,

672
00:26:41.359 --> 00:26:43.599
you can be a cue ball instead of an eight ball

673
00:26:43.599 --> 00:26:46.827
inside your own head, literally over time.

674
00:26:46.827 --> 00:26:48.802
Anyway, if you're on your own side,

675
00:26:48.802 --> 00:26:52.940
go, to remedy this tilt, actively, whoop,

676
00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:54.562
look for positive experiences,

677
00:26:54.562 --> 00:26:56.482
which'll just level the playing field.

678
00:26:56.482 --> 00:26:59.586
So, three, four, five times a day,

679
00:26:59.586 --> 00:27:02.700
sense something positive, look for a positive fact,

680
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:04.705
let it become a positive experience,

681
00:27:04.705 --> 00:27:07.127
then take 20 to 30 seconds with it

682
00:27:07.127 --> 00:27:10.507
so you really take time for those neurons to fire together,

683
00:27:10.507 --> 00:27:12.822
so they start really, really wiring together,

684
00:27:12.822 --> 00:27:14.582
and then let it fill your whole body.

685
00:27:14.582 --> 00:27:16.246
Let it be as intense as possible,

686
00:27:16.246 --> 00:27:17.526
it could be very private and secret,

687
00:27:17.526 --> 00:27:19.062
you're having a wonderful moment

688
00:27:19.062 --> 00:27:20.502
in the middle of this business meeting,

689
00:27:20.502 --> 00:27:22.923
or driving, or talking with some person,

690
00:27:22.923 --> 00:27:25.866
and then sense and intend that it's really sinking into you,

691
00:27:25.866 --> 00:27:28.245
that it's slowly getting woven in to the fabric

692
00:27:28.245 --> 00:27:29.877
of the brain and the self.

693
00:27:29.877 --> 00:27:31.765
<v Regina>I love that part of your book, by the way.</v>

694
00:27:31.765 --> 00:27:32.405
<v ->Thank you.</v>

695
00:27:32.405 --> 00:27:33.397
<v Regina>That was really lovely,</v>

696
00:27:33.397 --> 00:27:35.945
because how often do we actually take time?

697
00:27:35.945 --> 00:27:38.239
Normally something pleasant or nice happens,

698
00:27:38.239 --> 00:27:39.765
and we say, "Oh, that was nice,

699
00:27:39.765 --> 00:27:41.394
"now let me see what I have to do next."

700
00:27:41.394 --> 00:27:42.034
<v ->Exactly right.</v>

701
00:27:42.034 --> 00:27:42.983
<v Regina>We blow right by it,</v>

702
00:27:42.983 --> 00:27:44.957
and we don't ever tend to hard wire those events

703
00:27:44.957 --> 00:27:47.218
into our emotional, mental structures.

704
00:27:47.218 --> 00:27:49.234
<v ->Yeah, we're not on our own side.</v>

705
00:27:49.234 --> 00:27:52.114
Right in that little moment, if we were on our own side,

706
00:27:52.114 --> 00:27:54.822
we'd say, "Whew, this feels good.

707
00:27:54.822 --> 00:27:57.735
"It's not a million dollar moment, but it feels good.

708
00:27:57.735 --> 00:27:59.332
"Why don't I hang out with it for more than three seconds?"

709
00:27:59.332 --> 00:28:00.666
<v Regina>Yeah, but if you have a whole lot of $5,</v>

710
00:28:00.666 --> 00:28:02.497
or $10, or $20 moments,

711
00:28:02.497 --> 00:28:04.459
that is going to overall shift the balance

712
00:28:04.459 --> 00:28:06.699
within your reaction to life, isn't it?

713
00:28:06.699 --> 00:28:08.565
<v ->Absolutely, I'm gonna borrow that line,</v>

714
00:28:08.565 --> 00:28:09.962
that's a great line, thank you very much.

715
00:28:09.962 --> 00:28:10.560
(laughing)

716
00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.085
A lot of $5, and $10, and $20 moments.

717
00:28:12.085 --> 00:28:13.375
Exactly right.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

718
00:28:13.375 --> 00:28:13.941
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

719
00:28:13.941 --> 00:28:15.563
<v ->And you literally, if you do this, you know,</v>

720
00:28:15.563 --> 00:28:17.780
a half a dozen times a day,

721
00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.232
within a few weeks you'll feel different.

722
00:28:19.232 --> 00:28:21.013
Within a few years you'll be really different.

723
00:28:21.013 --> 00:28:23.232
It's also a great way to heal major things

724
00:28:23.232 --> 00:28:24.715
that were missing when you grew up.

725
00:28:24.715 --> 00:28:28.277
Or, you know, very painful experiences that you've had.

726
00:28:28.277 --> 00:28:31.114
The sense that this current, positive experience

727
00:28:31.114 --> 00:28:35.497
is sinking down into, balming and soothing those old places

728
00:28:35.497 --> 00:28:38.495
that are hurt and abraded and bruised and wounded,

729
00:28:38.495 --> 00:28:41.492
or where there was a deficit,

730
00:28:41.492 --> 00:28:43.636
they didn't get enough of what they needed,

731
00:28:43.636 --> 00:28:45.354
so that over time you gradually

732
00:28:45.354 --> 00:28:47.156
fill that hole in your heart.

733
00:28:47.156 --> 00:28:50.569
And that is a fundamental way to transform yourself

734
00:28:50.569 --> 00:28:52.713
that's grounded in neuroscience.

735
00:28:52.713 --> 00:28:56.116
And you can experience, in daily life, and you've earned it,

736
00:28:56.116 --> 00:28:58.130
'cause you've earned those good experiences, you know?

737
00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.211
You set the table, you put the food on the plate,

738
00:29:00.211 --> 00:29:03.187
bring a big spoon.
<v Regina>Yes, there you go.</v>

739
00:29:03.187 --> 00:29:04.690
<v Regina>Now, what about the opposite?</v>

740
00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:08.285
What if you walk into a situation that is aggressive?

741
00:29:08.285 --> 00:29:11.101
Now, we don't have the leopard on our tail,

742
00:29:11.101 --> 00:29:12.466
but say it's a business meeting.

743
00:29:12.466 --> 00:29:12.968
<v ->Sure.</v>

744
00:29:12.968 --> 00:29:13.682
<v Regina>And you walk in,</v>

745
00:29:13.682 --> 00:29:15.208
and there's an air of aggression,

746
00:29:15.208 --> 00:29:17.767
and people are at odds with each other,

747
00:29:17.767 --> 00:29:19.602
how do you manage your energy

748
00:29:19.602 --> 00:29:22.247
so you don't keep reinforcing those fear circuits

749
00:29:22.247 --> 00:29:25.042
in the midst of that environment?

750
00:29:25.042 --> 00:29:26.619
<v ->Right, that's a great question.</v>

751
00:29:26.619 --> 00:29:29.308
And let's be clear, you know the two mistakes

752
00:29:29.308 --> 00:29:30.363
people can make in life.

753
00:29:30.363 --> 00:29:33.404
One is they think there's no tiger,

754
00:29:33.404 --> 00:29:34.684
but there really is one.

755
00:29:34.684 --> 00:29:35.408
In other words, for example,

756
00:29:35.408 --> 00:29:37.861
they miss that it's an aggressive and tough situation

757
00:29:37.861 --> 00:29:40.347
they're walking into, or the deck is stacked against them,

758
00:29:40.347 --> 00:29:43.205
or people really don't have their best interest at heart.

759
00:29:43.205 --> 00:29:45.403
Or they're gonna pull out a gun momentarily.

760
00:29:45.403 --> 00:29:46.762
You know, there are real tigers in the world.

761
00:29:46.762 --> 00:29:47.344
<v Regina>Right.</v>

762
00:29:47.344 --> 00:29:48.985
<v ->We gotta really deal with those real tigers.</v>

763
00:29:48.985 --> 00:29:50.105
Then there's the other mistake, though,

764
00:29:50.105 --> 00:29:51.650
where you think there's a tiger there,

765
00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:55.129
and you act accordingly, but there really was no tiger.

766
00:29:55.129 --> 00:29:57.229
Or it was a paper tiger, or a painted tiger,

767
00:29:57.229 --> 00:29:59.288
or a chained tiger, or a stuffed tiger,

768
00:29:59.288 --> 00:30:01.848
or a baby tiger, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

769
00:30:01.848 --> 00:30:04.685
So that's the mistake we usually make.

770
00:30:04.685 --> 00:30:07.170
Now that's said, let's say there's a real tiger here.

771
00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.624
There's a real tough situation you're dealing with.

772
00:30:09.624 --> 00:30:13.026
One, recognize how that reactivates you, you know?

773
00:30:13.026 --> 00:30:16.204
It's literally like we're so, most of the aggression

774
00:30:16.204 --> 00:30:18.850
that we experienced in evolution was social aggression.

775
00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:20.610
In other words, we evolved on these bands

776
00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:23.402
that were very hierarchical, dominance hierarchies,

777
00:30:23.402 --> 00:30:25.322
and a lot of the aggression was internal

778
00:30:25.322 --> 00:30:27.018
or with other bands.

779
00:30:27.018 --> 00:30:30.164
It's interesting that it's estimated that roughly

780
00:30:30.164 --> 00:30:35.164
one man in 100 died in the 20th century due to war, alright?

781
00:30:36.617 --> 00:30:39.625
And that's considered an incredibly lethal century.

782
00:30:39.625 --> 00:30:43.005
The best estimates of hunter, gatherer cultures and groups,

783
00:30:43.005 --> 00:30:45.342
which are what humans evolved in,

784
00:30:45.342 --> 00:30:47.677
is that roughly one in eight men died.

785
00:30:47.677 --> 00:30:49.870
In other words, 15%, 15 times more men died--

786
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:50.940
<v Regina>A violent death, yeah.</v>

787
00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.540
<v ->A violent death because there's a lot of aggression there.</v>

788
00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:56.142
So appreciate how it is reactivating.

789
00:30:56.142 --> 00:30:58.083
Second, get on your own side.

790
00:30:58.083 --> 00:31:00.846
Third, access a felt sense of strength.

791
00:31:00.846 --> 00:31:02.083
You know, that's so important

792
00:31:02.083 --> 00:31:04.023
to tap into muscle memory, literally.

793
00:31:04.023 --> 00:31:05.250
I'll do a little thing where I'll sit up

794
00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:06.445
a little straighter.

795
00:31:06.445 --> 00:31:08.705
Or I'll squint my eyes a little,

796
00:31:08.705 --> 00:31:10.487
or I'll call up a memory of rock climbing,

797
00:31:10.487 --> 00:31:11.830
I've done a lot of rock climbing

798
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.185
and a lot of wilderness activities.

799
00:31:13.185 --> 00:31:16.204
Or I'll call up a memory of really being for my kids

800
00:31:16.204 --> 00:31:19.703
in some, you know, messy situation in grade school.

801
00:31:20.393 --> 00:31:23.857
That will then draw up, literally, that implicit memory.

802
00:31:23.857 --> 00:31:26.556
It'll light up the circuits of implicit memory

803
00:31:26.556 --> 00:31:28.530
that'll help me feel stronger.

804
00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:30.610
Another is to look over at that other person

805
00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:32.251
and see their suffering.

806
00:31:32.251 --> 00:31:36.390
That is a paradoxically powerful way to feel more powerful,

807
00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:37.615
in a sense, over here,

808
00:31:37.615 --> 00:31:39.771
to see the ways that they're suffering over there.

809
00:31:39.771 --> 00:31:41.232
Doesn't mean you're waiving your rights,

810
00:31:41.232 --> 00:31:42.801
doesn't mean you agree with them.

811
00:31:42.801 --> 00:31:44.724
It doesn't mean you don't think they should be locked up

812
00:31:44.724 --> 00:31:47.291
for a long time, or whatever, right?

813
00:31:47.291 --> 00:31:47.632
<v Regina>Yes. (laughing)</v>

814
00:31:47.632 --> 00:31:50.117
<v ->But you're not so reactived when you see their suffering.</v>

815
00:31:50.117 --> 00:31:51.662
And then you can act more skillfully.

816
00:31:51.662 --> 00:31:52.538
<v Regina>That thing you just said,</v>

817
00:31:52.538 --> 00:31:53.967
it also struck me in your book,

818
00:31:53.967 --> 00:31:55.300
and I thought that was really good,

819
00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.603
because it has to do with our reactive side,

820
00:31:57.603 --> 00:31:58.914
our defensive side, and so forth,

821
00:31:58.914 --> 00:32:03.914
and that is to take a breath, don't say anything,

822
00:32:04.089 --> 00:32:06.445
manage your energies, make a commitment to the things

823
00:32:06.445 --> 00:32:09.314
you were just talking about to bring a sense of strength in,

824
00:32:09.314 --> 00:32:12.365
of balance in, and recognize on,

825
00:32:12.365 --> 00:32:14.413
'cause this bumps up against ego

826
00:32:14.413 --> 00:32:18.380
that you're not waiving your rights because you choose

827
00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:20.407
to be empathetic in that moment.

828
00:32:20.407 --> 00:32:23.468
A lot of people feel, as I think you're implying there,

829
00:32:23.468 --> 00:32:26.730
that if we're to show our empathy,

830
00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:28.407
we're going to be now, we've waived our right,

831
00:32:28.407 --> 00:32:30.006
we're going to be taken advantage of.

832
00:32:30.006 --> 00:32:31.286
<v ->That's right.</v>

833
00:32:31.286 --> 00:32:32.044
<v Regina>Not true?</v>

834
00:32:32.044 --> 00:32:32.747
<v ->Not true at all.</v>

835
00:32:32.747 --> 00:32:34.444
It's funny, that's why I wrote actually a chapter

836
00:32:34.444 --> 00:32:36.427
on compassion and assertiveness,

837
00:32:36.427 --> 00:32:38.005
and the idea of putting them together, to me,

838
00:32:38.005 --> 00:32:39.147
is really interesting.

839
00:32:39.147 --> 00:32:40.289
And of course, that's the bread and butter

840
00:32:40.289 --> 00:32:41.909
of a therapist, especially
<v Regina>Let's talk about</v>

841
00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:43.061
a couple's counselor
<v Regina>that because</v>

842
00:32:43.061 --> 00:32:44.053
<v Regina>you dealt with a lot of this</v>

843
00:32:44.053 --> 00:32:48.405
within the hierarchy of your meditation group, right?

844
00:32:48.405 --> 00:32:50.868
The foundation you were working with, I think it is.

845
00:32:50.868 --> 00:32:51.550
<v ->Oh, I see.</v>

846
00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:53.449
<v Regina>And you were using that as an example</v>

847
00:32:53.449 --> 00:32:55.967
in the book at board meetings, and so forth,

848
00:32:55.967 --> 00:33:00.767
how people communicated in this both empathetic

849
00:33:00.767 --> 00:33:02.388
and also assertive way.

850
00:33:02.388 --> 00:33:04.564
Can you give us an example of what that looks like

851
00:33:04.564 --> 00:33:05.983
in its ideal form.

852
00:33:05.983 --> 00:33:09.052
<v ->Right, well in that situation I was commenting on</v>

853
00:33:09.052 --> 00:33:12.488
being on the board of a very large meditation center

854
00:33:12.488 --> 00:33:14.855
for many years, and observing the teachers there.

855
00:33:14.855 --> 00:33:17.373
Particularly when I was a newbie just trying to suss out

856
00:33:17.373 --> 00:33:19.207
what's up, what's going on here.

857
00:33:19.207 --> 00:33:23.549
And I would see them be very calm, very at ease,

858
00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:26.086
very peaceful, very tracking, very present,

859
00:33:26.086 --> 00:33:28.551
not as a fake, not like that New Age stare, you know,

860
00:33:28.551 --> 00:33:29.511
this is what these people do,

861
00:33:29.511 --> 00:33:30.651
it's the real deal.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

862
00:33:30.651 --> 00:33:32.551
<v Rick>On the other hand, when it came time to speak,</v>

863
00:33:32.551 --> 00:33:35.013
clunk, they said what needed to be said.

864
00:33:35.013 --> 00:33:38.203
It was like a stone dropping into a pond, kathunk.

865
00:33:38.203 --> 00:33:39.696
And then they let it go.

866
00:33:39.696 --> 00:33:41.499
They just said it and they moved on.

867
00:33:41.499 --> 00:33:43.866
And that was a great model for me of this culmination

868
00:33:43.866 --> 00:33:46.224
that had great power behind it,

869
00:33:46.224 --> 00:33:47.387
because I have a business background.

870
00:33:47.387 --> 00:33:50.383
I've done a lot of tough, business type situations,

871
00:33:50.383 --> 00:33:54.148
and to watch people not posture, not bluster,

872
00:33:54.148 --> 00:33:55.450
not throw their chest out,

873
00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:58.105
but actually communicate with great dignity and presence,

874
00:33:58.105 --> 00:34:01.422
that actually had more impact than a lot of chest thumping.

875
00:34:01.422 --> 00:34:03.567
That was the thing that I saw there.

876
00:34:03.567 --> 00:34:06.628
With people in general, it's interesting that

877
00:34:06.628 --> 00:34:09.380
to be compassionate, truly, with other people,

878
00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.884
and not feel like a doormat,

879
00:34:10.884 --> 00:34:12.825
or that they're just gonna overrun you,

880
00:34:12.825 --> 00:34:15.640
or you're gonna get used up, and depleted,

881
00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:16.804
and wrung out, and, you know,

882
00:34:16.804 --> 00:34:18.744
my dad had grown up on a ranch in North Dakota.

883
00:34:18.744 --> 00:34:21.414
Before he became a zoologist he had a phrase,

884
00:34:21.414 --> 00:34:22.993
"Rid hard and put up wet."

885
00:34:22.993 --> 00:34:23.771
You know what I mean? (laughing)

886
00:34:23.771 --> 00:34:25.296
<v Regina>Yes, I know, I heard it was rode hard</v>

887
00:34:25.296 --> 00:34:26.951
and put up wet, but yeah, there you go.

888
00:34:26.951 --> 00:34:28.062
<v ->There you go, that's right.</v>

889
00:34:28.062 --> 00:34:29.417
(both laughing)

890
00:34:29.417 --> 00:34:33.126
So the point is, to not feel like we've been

891
00:34:33.126 --> 00:34:35.176
ridden hard and put up wet,

892
00:34:35.176 --> 00:34:37.118
we've got to be able to stand up for ourselves.

893
00:34:37.118 --> 00:34:38.420
But you know, it's the old line,

894
00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.018
fences make for good neighbors.

895
00:34:40.018 --> 00:34:42.611
In other words, if we hold boundaries,

896
00:34:42.611 --> 00:34:44.039
and take care of our own interests,

897
00:34:44.039 --> 00:34:44.957
then we're much more able to

898
00:34:44.957 --> 00:34:46.654
be compassionate with other people.

899
00:34:46.654 --> 00:34:49.853
On the other hand, if we're compassionate for other people,

900
00:34:49.853 --> 00:34:52.199
we avoid needless contentiousness,

901
00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:54.835
and we don't have to exhaust ourselves

902
00:34:54.835 --> 00:34:56.998
tilting at windmills and fighting all kinds of battles

903
00:34:56.998 --> 00:34:58.535
that we don't really need to fight.

904
00:34:58.535 --> 00:35:00.433
So in that sense, the other side is true,

905
00:35:00.433 --> 00:35:03.474
the compassion, and related capacities like empathy,

906
00:35:03.474 --> 00:35:06.257
and kindness, and goodwill for the other people

907
00:35:06.257 --> 00:35:09.289
that, you know, where you're happy that they're happy.

908
00:35:09.289 --> 00:35:11.579
All those capacities support, you know,

909
00:35:11.579 --> 00:35:13.723
being assertive in appropriate ways.

910
00:35:13.723 --> 00:35:15.055
<v Regina>And let's take the fake it</v>

911
00:35:15.055 --> 00:35:16.154
'til you make it stance.

912
00:35:16.154 --> 00:35:18.138
If you don't quite have the disciplines down yet

913
00:35:18.138 --> 00:35:21.742
there are things you can do, even by way of body languaging,

914
00:35:21.742 --> 00:35:24.900
body position, facial expression, and so forth,

915
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:29.177
that can trigger chemicals to essentially guide you

916
00:35:29.177 --> 00:35:30.221
into those feelings,

917
00:35:30.221 --> 00:35:32.035
from what I was picking up in your book.

918
00:35:32.035 --> 00:35:35.822
<v ->Oh, yeah, more than anything I'm interested in</v>

919
00:35:35.822 --> 00:35:38.115
what can real people do in real life, you know,

920
00:35:38.115 --> 00:35:39.147
three minutes a day.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

921
00:35:39.147 --> 00:35:41.558
<v Rick>You know, in the real stuff, especially when,</v>

922
00:35:41.558 --> 00:35:44.385
it's easy to be calm and mellow, right,

923
00:35:44.385 --> 00:35:45.687
when you're sitting on a beach with a drink

924
00:35:45.687 --> 00:35:47.703
that's got an umbrella sticking out of it.

925
00:35:47.703 --> 00:35:51.145
But to be present, and take care of business,

926
00:35:51.145 --> 00:35:53.684
in a business situation, or raising a family,

927
00:35:53.684 --> 00:35:55.167
I've written a lot about raising families,

928
00:35:55.167 --> 00:35:56.744
I know that world very well.

929
00:35:56.744 --> 00:35:59.304
Or in a tricky conversation with a loved one,

930
00:35:59.304 --> 00:36:01.064
or you're dealing with an aging parent,

931
00:36:01.064 --> 00:36:02.750
you're trying to grapple with what to do there,

932
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:03.869
and so forth.

933
00:36:03.869 --> 00:36:06.184
To be able to draw on certain skills.

934
00:36:06.184 --> 00:36:07.881
You know, the brain is the ultimate tool,

935
00:36:07.881 --> 00:36:10.547
and what I wanted to offer was, basically,

936
00:36:10.547 --> 00:36:13.683
a toolbox of tools for the ultimate tool, right?

937
00:36:13.683 --> 00:36:15.443
And that's what we really have there.

938
00:36:15.443 --> 00:36:19.723
Now, in relationships, to do what you're getting at there,

939
00:36:19.723 --> 00:36:21.521
there are a number of things to do.

940
00:36:21.521 --> 00:36:25.564
For one, frankly, is to just relax the body,

941
00:36:25.564 --> 00:36:28.508
because when the body's relaxed it's hard to feel anxious.

942
00:36:28.508 --> 00:36:29.628
You know, when we're not feeling anxious,

943
00:36:29.628 --> 00:36:31.708
we're gonna open to the other person

944
00:36:31.708 --> 00:36:33.787
and get so much more information.

945
00:36:33.787 --> 00:36:37.125
Even on a sales call, not being afraid of your prospects,

946
00:36:37.125 --> 00:36:39.227
or your customers, but relaxing,

947
00:36:39.227 --> 00:36:40.976
so that you can be present with them,

948
00:36:40.976 --> 00:36:43.855
so you can see what they really need to close the deal.

949
00:36:43.855 --> 00:36:45.466
<v Regina>It's like take a breath first, right?</v>

950
00:36:45.466 --> 00:36:47.749
<v ->Yeah, exhale especially, exhaling activates</v>

951
00:36:47.749 --> 00:36:50.586
the parasympathetic wing of the nervous system, technically.

952
00:36:50.586 --> 00:36:51.492
<v Regina>Long exhalation.</v>

953
00:36:51.492 --> 00:36:53.092
<v ->Yeah, focus on the exhalation.</v>

954
00:36:53.092 --> 00:36:55.193
The inhalation activates the parasympathetic,

955
00:36:55.193 --> 00:36:57.872
that's why the heart speeds up a little bit when we inhale,

956
00:36:57.872 --> 00:36:59.492
and slows down a little bit when we exhale.

957
00:36:59.492 --> 00:37:01.946
<v Regina>Sympathetic inhale, and parasympathetic exhale.</v>

958
00:37:01.946 --> 00:37:03.269
<v ->Yeah, that's right.</v>

959
00:37:03.269 --> 00:37:05.668
So really focus on exhaling.

960
00:37:05.668 --> 00:37:07.812
Another little trick with people to feel safer,

961
00:37:07.812 --> 00:37:10.105
touch your lips, do it unobtrusively.

962
00:37:10.105 --> 00:37:11.929
<v Regina>People do do that a lot, unconsciously,</v>

963
00:37:11.929 --> 00:37:12.931
in meetings and such.

964
00:37:12.931 --> 00:37:15.811
What is this doing, these little spots along here?

965
00:37:15.811 --> 00:37:18.073
<v ->Sometimes they do it because it's body language,</v>

966
00:37:18.073 --> 00:37:19.289
they're muzzling themselves,

967
00:37:19.289 --> 00:37:21.165
or holding back something they want to say.

968
00:37:21.165 --> 00:37:23.245
But doing this is quite soothing, actually,

969
00:37:23.245 --> 00:37:26.286
because a lot of parasympathetic nerve endings innervate,

970
00:37:26.286 --> 00:37:28.728
they flow into the lips.

971
00:37:28.728 --> 00:37:30.328
Because the parasympathetic nervous system

972
00:37:30.328 --> 00:37:31.917
is the so-called rest and digest wing

973
00:37:31.917 --> 00:37:33.036
of the nervous system.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

974
00:37:33.036 --> 00:37:35.534
<v Rick>So there's a lot of digesting that begins,</v>

975
00:37:35.534 --> 00:37:37.113
you know, at the lips as well.

976
00:37:37.113 --> 00:37:39.311
<v Regina>Okay, so touching the lips,</v>

977
00:37:39.311 --> 00:37:40.792
I see people do this in meetings.

978
00:37:40.792 --> 00:37:42.818
This is something that isn't just a nervous tic,

979
00:37:42.818 --> 00:37:45.188
there's actually, perhaps, a reason behind this.

980
00:37:45.188 --> 00:37:47.298
<v ->Well sometimes they're doing it because it's body language</v>

981
00:37:47.298 --> 00:37:48.651
that they're trying to muzzle themselves,

982
00:37:48.651 --> 00:37:49.707
or hold something back,

983
00:37:49.707 --> 00:37:51.852
but it's also a wonderful way to soothe yourself.

984
00:37:51.852 --> 00:37:54.273
For example, people who work with horses

985
00:37:54.273 --> 00:37:56.247
that are really upset will often touch them

986
00:37:56.247 --> 00:37:57.334
around the mouth.

987
00:37:57.334 --> 00:37:58.828
Or if you're working with young children,

988
00:37:58.828 --> 00:37:59.894
it's very soothing.

989
00:37:59.894 --> 00:38:02.709
Or, I'll admit it on video here,

990
00:38:02.709 --> 00:38:04.288
that sometimes to go to sleep,

991
00:38:04.288 --> 00:38:06.005
I'll put a knuckle next to my lip.

992
00:38:06.005 --> 00:38:07.051
I don't such my thumb,

993
00:38:07.051 --> 00:38:08.747
but I'll just put a little knuckle there,

994
00:38:08.747 --> 00:38:10.347
and that'll be soothing,

995
00:38:10.347 --> 00:38:12.393
as well as bringing up lots of associations.

996
00:38:12.393 --> 00:38:14.570
But we're talking also about how to activate

997
00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:17.225
that quality of compassion for other people.

998
00:38:17.225 --> 00:38:20.244
Another powerful one is to look people in the eyes.

999
00:38:20.244 --> 00:38:23.070
Most parts of the brain do many, many things,

1000
00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:25.546
but there are a few parts of the brain

1001
00:38:25.546 --> 00:38:29.961
that pretty much just do one very narrow function.

1002
00:38:29.961 --> 00:38:31.191
We evolved that part of the brain

1003
00:38:31.191 --> 00:38:32.214
to do that narrow functioning,

1004
00:38:32.214 --> 00:38:34.455
'cause that narrow function was incredibly important.

1005
00:38:34.455 --> 00:38:36.971
There's a part of the brain called the fusiform gyrus

1006
00:38:36.971 --> 00:38:39.276
that just tracks facial expressions.

1007
00:38:39.276 --> 00:38:41.856
<v Regina>Ah, to see whether they're safe or accepted--</v>

1008
00:38:41.856 --> 00:38:44.298
<v ->Yeah, 'cause they're so informative.</v>

1009
00:38:44.298 --> 00:38:46.497
So much information is conveyed by the face,

1010
00:38:46.497 --> 00:38:49.291
especially around the muscles around the eyes and the mouth.

1011
00:38:49.291 --> 00:38:51.103
So if you want to tune in to another person,

1012
00:38:51.103 --> 00:38:54.783
and also, potentially, activate more kindness for them,

1013
00:38:54.783 --> 00:38:55.764
look at their eyes.

1014
00:38:55.764 --> 00:38:59.125
Another thing I do, I track the being behind the eyes.

1015
00:38:59.125 --> 00:39:01.417
In other words, I have a sense that I'm with someone

1016
00:39:01.417 --> 00:39:04.318
behind the eyes, and I just sense their suffering.

1017
00:39:04.318 --> 00:39:06.538
It's not like I'm patronizing them, or feeling superior,

1018
00:39:06.538 --> 00:39:08.223
because I know I'm suffering over here,

1019
00:39:08.223 --> 00:39:09.755
but I just track the small ways,

1020
00:39:09.755 --> 00:39:11.717
I mean, not gross horrible suffering,

1021
00:39:11.717 --> 00:39:14.138
I mean the subtle forms of suffering

1022
00:39:14.138 --> 00:39:15.343
that really matter to us.

1023
00:39:15.343 --> 00:39:17.722
Like feeling strained, or stressed,

1024
00:39:17.722 --> 00:39:19.717
or a little worried about something,

1025
00:39:19.717 --> 00:39:23.182
or threatened, or grappling with aging,

1026
00:39:23.182 --> 00:39:24.142
et cetera, et cetera.

1027
00:39:24.142 --> 00:39:27.055
That alone tends to, you know, activate kindness.

1028
00:39:27.055 --> 00:39:28.482
Then the last thing, one real fast note,

1029
00:39:28.482 --> 00:39:30.799
I recognize that it's my self-interest.

1030
00:39:30.799 --> 00:39:33.128
It's in my self-interest to be kind to other people.

1031
00:39:33.128 --> 00:39:34.397
It's enlightened self-interest

1032
00:39:34.397 --> 00:39:36.456
to not take things so personally,

1033
00:39:36.456 --> 00:39:38.056
not worry so much about me,

1034
00:39:38.056 --> 00:39:40.572
be really focused on how to be useful to them,

1035
00:39:40.572 --> 00:39:41.949
how to be helpful to them.

1036
00:39:41.949 --> 00:39:46.055
That, you know, pardoxical sense is my best strategy

1037
00:39:46.055 --> 00:39:47.527
of self-interest,

1038
00:39:47.527 --> 00:39:49.670
to not worry so much about my self interest.

1039
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:53.005
<v Regina>Yeah, absolutely, no, I understand that.</v>

1040
00:39:53.005 --> 00:39:54.639
Now, you said something a moment ago

1041
00:39:54.639 --> 00:39:56.377
that this was a bit of an aside,

1042
00:39:56.377 --> 00:39:57.860
so just skip right over and say,

1043
00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:59.535
"I don't know, we don't need to talk about that."

1044
00:39:59.535 --> 00:40:01.454
But this whole notion of reading faces,

1045
00:40:01.454 --> 00:40:03.939
one of the things I've read that comes up often

1046
00:40:03.939 --> 00:40:07.480
with people who are autistic, or labeled as autistic,

1047
00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:12.480
is there's an inability to be able to have that function.

1048
00:40:12.792 --> 00:40:14.573
<v ->That's correct, they're just really poor</v>

1049
00:40:14.573 --> 00:40:18.114
at picking up social cues, including the subtle information

1050
00:40:18.114 --> 00:40:22.093
that's conveyed in ways that a typical person

1051
00:40:22.093 --> 00:40:23.853
is very comfortable with receiving,

1052
00:40:23.853 --> 00:40:25.592
that's conveyed through facial expression.

1053
00:40:25.592 --> 00:40:27.138
<v Regina>So that portion of the brain is simply</v>

1054
00:40:27.138 --> 00:40:28.344
not firing properly?

1055
00:40:28.344 --> 00:40:30.423
<v ->Correct, or it's flooded by other things.</v>

1056
00:40:30.423 --> 00:40:31.244
I mean, one of the things with--

1057
00:40:31.244 --> 00:40:32.403
<v Regina>Overwhelmed, yeah.</v>

1058
00:40:32.403 --> 00:40:34.848
<v ->That happens with people on the autistic spectrum</v>

1059
00:40:34.848 --> 00:40:38.848
is there's, very often they're just flooded

1060
00:40:38.848 --> 00:40:41.003
with stimulation.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1061
00:40:41.003 --> 00:40:43.285
<v Rick>So then it's hard to track something like the brain</v>

1062
00:40:43.285 --> 00:40:45.738
because it's like a signal lost in a sea of noise.

1063
00:40:45.738 --> 00:40:46.538
<v Regina>Right, and it's--</v>

1064
00:40:46.538 --> 00:40:47.926
<v ->Track the face is what I meant to say.</v>

1065
00:40:47.926 --> 00:40:50.112
<v Regina>Yeah, it's because it's a relatively subtle</v>

1066
00:40:50.112 --> 00:40:51.582
set of signals compared to what else

1067
00:40:51.582 --> 00:40:53.278
they might be perceiving at that time.

1068
00:40:53.278 --> 00:40:54.601
That was just an aside, another thing--

1069
00:40:54.601 --> 00:40:56.766
<v ->Or their face is so intense.</v>

1070
00:40:56.766 --> 00:40:59.038
In other words, the eyes are so intense,

1071
00:40:59.038 --> 00:41:01.737
it's just, it's like they need to put on sunglasses,

1072
00:41:01.737 --> 00:41:03.561
in effect, because the lights are so bright.

1073
00:41:03.561 --> 00:41:05.023
<v Regina>Oh, interesting.</v>

1074
00:41:05.023 --> 00:41:08.464
<v ->Very often, in couples, typically it's the man</v>

1075
00:41:08.464 --> 00:41:11.706
about which this could be said, not necessarily,

1076
00:41:11.706 --> 00:41:14.939
but basically she's wanting more emotional contact

1077
00:41:14.939 --> 00:41:17.445
and presence, she's wanting more supplies

1078
00:41:17.445 --> 00:41:19.142
coming across the table here,

1079
00:41:19.142 --> 00:41:22.885
and she sees him as sort of inert, and kind of cold,

1080
00:41:22.885 --> 00:41:24.187
and not that caring.

1081
00:41:24.187 --> 00:41:26.598
The truth is, he cares so much about her,

1082
00:41:26.598 --> 00:41:27.941
that any little thing that happens

1083
00:41:27.941 --> 00:41:29.359
just kind of floods him,

1084
00:41:29.359 --> 00:41:33.956
so he distances to preserve some capacity to stay connected.

1085
00:41:33.956 --> 00:41:34.746
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>

1086
00:41:34.746 --> 00:41:35.705
<v ->It's a very interesting way--</v>

1087
00:41:35.705 --> 00:41:37.359
<v Regina>That's very much misunderstood.</v>

1088
00:41:37.359 --> 00:41:39.418
<v ->Yeah, totally, and it's a nice way to understand it,</v>

1089
00:41:39.418 --> 00:41:41.881
if it's true, obviously, and he's not just a brick

1090
00:41:41.881 --> 00:41:43.557
and hating on her.
<v Regina>Right, right.</v>

1091
00:41:43.557 --> 00:41:45.401
<v Rick>Whatever, you know, but you gotta track</v>

1092
00:41:45.401 --> 00:41:46.197
which tiger is it,
<v Regina>But you should know</v>

1093
00:41:46.197 --> 00:41:46.939
the real one or the fake one.
<v Regina>at some point</v>

1094
00:41:46.939 --> 00:41:48.097
<v Regina>whether you're married to a brick or not.</v>

1095
00:41:48.097 --> 00:41:49.163
<v ->That's right, that's right.
<v Regina>Yeah, right.</v>

1096
00:41:49.163 --> 00:41:51.638
<v Rick>Very often it's because he's flooded,</v>

1097
00:41:51.638 --> 00:41:53.536
so if he can then, paradoxically,

1098
00:41:53.536 --> 00:41:55.317
you know, fences make for good neighbors.

1099
00:41:55.317 --> 00:41:58.761
They have more capacity to stay centered in himself,

1100
00:41:58.761 --> 00:42:00.041
then he's more able to be present

1101
00:42:00.041 --> 00:42:01.503
and leaning forward for her.

1102
00:42:01.503 --> 00:42:02.463
<v Regina>Very interesting.</v>

1103
00:42:02.463 --> 00:42:03.465
<v ->But I did hear too, by the way,</v>

1104
00:42:03.465 --> 00:42:06.550
is a good thing in relationships is to lean forward.

1105
00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:08.935
'Cause that immediately starts activating

1106
00:42:08.935 --> 00:42:09.948
all kinds of signals internally.

1107
00:42:09.948 --> 00:42:10.972
<v Regina>I'm here, I'm not nonchalant,</v>

1108
00:42:10.972 --> 00:42:11.954
I'm not disconnected.
<v Rick>Yeah, not just</v>

1109
00:42:11.954 --> 00:42:14.385
<v Rick>the message it sends, but internally in here,</v>

1110
00:42:14.385 --> 00:42:17.548
it just moves us into that social mode.

1111
00:42:17.548 --> 00:42:19.249
<v Regina>Nurturing.</v>
<v Rick>Good stuff.</v>

1112
00:42:19.249 --> 00:42:20.146
<v Regina>That's kind of a natural place</v>

1113
00:42:20.146 --> 00:42:20.933
to go to from there,

1114
00:42:20.933 --> 00:42:23.000
and there was something I thought was kind of cute.

1115
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.890
You were writing about science is showing

1116
00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:28.525
that the nurturer is actually the one

1117
00:42:28.525 --> 00:42:32.066
that is receiving more stress release, believe it or not,

1118
00:42:32.066 --> 00:42:33.890
than the person being nurtured.

1119
00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:35.726
You say you tried to pull that on your wife

1120
00:42:35.726 --> 00:42:37.123
as to why it's so good she should give you

1121
00:42:37.123 --> 00:42:38.466
more back scratches?
<v Rick>That's right.</v>

1122
00:42:38.466 --> 00:42:39.149
(Regina laughing)

1123
00:42:39.149 --> 00:42:40.302
<v Rick>Aw, you really read my book carefully.</v>

1124
00:42:40.302 --> 00:42:40.874
<v Regina>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Rick>That's great.</v>

1125
00:42:40.874 --> 00:42:42.316
<v Regina>I read your book, uh-huh.</v>

1126
00:42:42.316 --> 00:42:44.598
And she's not buying it, but nonetheless,

1127
00:42:44.598 --> 00:42:46.178
let's talk about that, right?

1128
00:42:46.178 --> 00:42:49.132
<v ->(laughing) Well that was a riff off of studies</v>

1129
00:42:49.132 --> 00:42:51.670
that show that, you know, related to what I said earlier

1130
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:54.092
how, you know, love, broadly defined,

1131
00:42:54.092 --> 00:42:56.555
has really driven, more than any other force,

1132
00:42:56.555 --> 00:42:59.733
any other factor, love has driven the evolution of the brain

1133
00:42:59.733 --> 00:43:01.948
over the last hundred million years.

1134
00:43:02.858 --> 00:43:05.991
One of the main bursts of that has been in primate groups,

1135
00:43:05.991 --> 00:43:07.614
and than human evolution.

1136
00:43:07.614 --> 00:43:11.136
Just to kind of mark it in time, the oldest stone tools

1137
00:43:11.136 --> 00:43:14.154
are about 2.5, 2.7 million years old.

1138
00:43:14.154 --> 00:43:17.333
Those folks had brains 1/3 of our size, but,

1139
00:43:17.333 --> 00:43:18.516
the brain has tripled, in other words,

1140
00:43:18.516 --> 00:43:20.213
over the last three million years.

1141
00:43:20.213 --> 00:43:21.737
But they could make stone tools.

1142
00:43:21.737 --> 00:43:24.151
I can't make a stone tool.

1143
00:43:24.151 --> 00:43:25.393
It's not easy to make a stone tool,

1144
00:43:25.393 --> 00:43:27.013
but they were smart enough to make a stone tool.

1145
00:43:27.013 --> 00:43:27.867
<v Regina>You probably wouldn't know how</v>

1146
00:43:27.867 --> 00:43:29.052
to track the animal, either.

1147
00:43:29.052 --> 00:43:30.864
<v ->No, I'd be really hungry, really bad.</v>

1148
00:43:30.864 --> 00:43:32.064
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1149
00:43:32.064 --> 00:43:33.903
<v ->You know, nobody wants therapy on the Serengeti,</v>

1150
00:43:33.903 --> 00:43:35.086
so I'd be out of luck.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1151
00:43:35.086 --> 00:43:36.784
<v Regina>And you wouldn't know which herbs to choose.</v>

1152
00:43:36.784 --> 00:43:38.676
You might poison yourself.
<v Rick>No, I'd just, no.</v>

1153
00:43:38.676 --> 00:43:39.701
<v Regina>Probably wouldn't be around very long.</v>

1154
00:43:39.701 --> 00:43:41.002
<v ->I'm in trouble, big trouble.</v>

1155
00:43:41.002 --> 00:43:46.002
No, so, let's see, as we evolved, you know,

1156
00:43:46.623 --> 00:43:48.660
in this last three million years,

1157
00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:51.637
the 2/3 of the brain, basically, that's been added

1158
00:43:51.637 --> 00:43:54.954
is largely devoted to social, emotional capabilities.

1159
00:43:54.954 --> 00:43:59.434
Language processing, emotional signals, empathy skills,

1160
00:43:59.434 --> 00:44:01.353
cooperative planning abilities,

1161
00:44:01.353 --> 00:44:02.879
being able to foresee the future,

1162
00:44:02.879 --> 00:44:05.501
reflect on the past in a social frame.

1163
00:44:05.501 --> 00:44:09.278
That's been driven by the reproductive benefits,

1164
00:44:09.278 --> 00:44:12.115
as it's called, that's the real engine of evolution.

1165
00:44:12.115 --> 00:44:15.100
That increase of the brain has been driven, in large part,

1166
00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.533
because the functions that it serves

1167
00:44:17.533 --> 00:44:19.432
were so critical to survival.

1168
00:44:19.432 --> 00:44:22.941
What are the functions that those new layers, and levels,

1169
00:44:22.941 --> 00:44:26.375
and parts of the brain do?

1170
00:44:26.375 --> 00:44:27.836
What are their functions?

1171
00:44:27.836 --> 00:44:29.575
They're social, emotional functions.

1172
00:44:29.575 --> 00:44:32.220
So in that context, I reported in the book,

1173
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:34.310
on a study that was done in primates

1174
00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:36.338
where they observed how much time they spent

1175
00:44:36.338 --> 00:44:38.051
grooming each other.

1176
00:44:38.051 --> 00:44:39.909
A typical primate band, very often,

1177
00:44:39.909 --> 00:44:42.315
will spend about 1/6th of its waking hours

1178
00:44:42.315 --> 00:44:44.728
scratching other people, looking for bugs, I mean,

1179
00:44:44.728 --> 00:44:46.113
that's a protein source.
<v Regina>Yeah, like 18%</v>

1180
00:44:46.113 --> 00:44:48.387
<v Regina>of their day nit-picking.</v>

1181
00:44:48.387 --> 00:44:50.322
<v ->Nit-picking, you know.</v>

1182
00:44:50.322 --> 00:44:52.661
<v ->That's not how we mean nit-picking.</v>

1183
00:44:52.661 --> 00:44:54.026
Humans have, yeah.
<v Rick>Yeah.</v>

1184
00:44:54.026 --> 00:44:55.583
<v Rick>Real little bugs.</v>

1185
00:44:55.583 --> 00:44:56.842
<v Regina>Picking bugs off of each other.</v>

1186
00:44:56.842 --> 00:44:57.919
<v ->Real little nits, real little nits.</v>

1187
00:44:57.919 --> 00:44:59.518
Yeah, and other things, scratching each other and stuff.

1188
00:44:59.518 --> 00:45:01.801
The interesting thing is that, in one study,

1189
00:45:01.801 --> 00:45:04.529
they actually anesthetized, I think it's Macaque monkeys,

1190
00:45:04.529 --> 00:45:06.471
or some primate species.

1191
00:45:06.471 --> 00:45:08.252
They anesthetized them afterward,

1192
00:45:08.252 --> 00:45:10.876
and then tracked levels of stress hormones

1193
00:45:10.876 --> 00:45:12.187
in the bodies of the people

1194
00:45:12.187 --> 00:45:14.790
who are getting groomed, the groomees,

1195
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:17.831
versus the people who are doing the grooming, the groomers.

1196
00:45:17.831 --> 00:45:19.889
And they found that the groomees actually had

1197
00:45:19.889 --> 00:45:23.536
more stress hormones than the groomers.

1198
00:45:23.536 --> 00:45:24.890
In other words, the groomers were getting

1199
00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:27.535
a stress-relief benefit from doing all the back scratching

1200
00:45:27.535 --> 00:45:28.987
and nit-picking, and bug eating.

1201
00:45:28.987 --> 00:45:29.894
<v Regina>I was thinking about that</v>

1202
00:45:29.894 --> 00:45:31.109
as I was reading your book,

1203
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.994
that really makes sense,

1204
00:45:31.994 --> 00:45:34.693
because if you're the one that is putting that energy out,

1205
00:45:34.693 --> 00:45:36.912
and oftentimes maybe giving someone a foot rub,

1206
00:45:36.912 --> 00:45:41.912
or what not, there is a kind of grace and rhythmic element

1207
00:45:41.988 --> 00:45:43.752
to doing something like that.

1208
00:45:43.752 --> 00:45:45.751
You're taking yourself into that,

1209
00:45:45.751 --> 00:45:50.751
more of a parasympathetic relaxed frame of mind.

1210
00:45:51.042 --> 00:45:51.632
<v ->Yes.</v>

1211
00:45:51.632 --> 00:45:53.020
<v Regina>A nervous system response.</v>

1212
00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:55.154
<v ->Yeah, exactly, it's calming and soothing.</v>

1213
00:45:55.154 --> 00:45:57.735
Interestingly, it's also emotionally very rewarding.

1214
00:45:57.735 --> 00:46:00.635
Like another study, I believe I mentioned,

1215
00:46:00.635 --> 00:46:02.982
tracked people who, in an experiment,

1216
00:46:02.982 --> 00:46:05.168
were given some amount of money, fairly modest,

1217
00:46:05.168 --> 00:46:07.025
but like $10 or $20,

1218
00:46:07.025 --> 00:46:08.785
and then they can keep it for themselves,

1219
00:46:08.785 --> 00:46:10.790
or they could give it to charity.

1220
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:13.328
And they were in the scanner when they made the decision,

1221
00:46:13.328 --> 00:46:15.525
give it to charity or keep it for themselves,

1222
00:46:15.525 --> 00:46:17.243
and they got much more activation

1223
00:46:17.243 --> 00:46:18.864
in the reward centers of the brain

1224
00:46:18.864 --> 00:46:19.930
when they gave it to charity.

1225
00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:20.847
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

1226
00:46:20.847 --> 00:46:21.603
<v ->Isn't that interesting?</v>

1227
00:46:21.603 --> 00:46:23.726
<v Regina>It is interesting, but it also shows us</v>

1228
00:46:23.726 --> 00:46:25.827
that we are innately good,

1229
00:46:25.827 --> 00:46:28.259
and that we have come a long way already

1230
00:46:28.259 --> 00:46:30.222
in our evolution.
<v Rick>Totally true.</v>

1231
00:46:30.222 --> 00:46:32.899
<v Regina>I mean, we beat ourselves up for the negativity,</v>

1232
00:46:32.899 --> 00:46:35.406
the kind of, you know, the cons we try to put over

1233
00:46:35.406 --> 00:46:37.379
on each other, you know, throughout humanity

1234
00:46:37.379 --> 00:46:41.144
via whether it's politics, even religion, education,

1235
00:46:41.144 --> 00:46:44.059
but when you scratch it all away,

1236
00:46:44.059 --> 00:46:47.115
you just talked about that little experiment

1237
00:46:47.115 --> 00:46:48.638
really says it, doesn't it?

1238
00:46:48.638 --> 00:46:50.431
<v ->It totally does, I mean, you just see it</v>

1239
00:46:50.431 --> 00:46:53.610
all over the place that human beings,

1240
00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:57.918
it's sort of like dark clouds, storm clouds in the sky.

1241
00:46:57.918 --> 00:47:00.074
If there are storm clouds in the sky

1242
00:47:00.074 --> 00:47:01.834
that's what our eye goes to, right?

1243
00:47:01.834 --> 00:47:04.532
That becomes the figure, and the sky is the ground.

1244
00:47:04.532 --> 00:47:09.375
In the same way, you know, most of the sky

1245
00:47:09.375 --> 00:47:13.076
of human relationships is cooperative, caring,

1246
00:47:13.076 --> 00:47:15.016
altruistic cooperation.

1247
00:47:15.016 --> 00:47:17.993
We notice the drums of war, right?

1248
00:47:17.993 --> 00:47:20.531
Because we evolved to pay a lot of attention to anger,

1249
00:47:20.531 --> 00:47:23.516
because it's a really important social signal, and threat.

1250
00:47:23.516 --> 00:47:27.229
But really, we are losing sight of this vast sky

1251
00:47:27.229 --> 00:47:30.973
of exactly what you've said, of fundamental human nature,

1252
00:47:30.973 --> 00:47:33.395
and fundamentally how people operate,

1253
00:47:33.395 --> 00:47:35.591
and fundamentally the forces that have driven us,

1254
00:47:35.591 --> 00:47:37.533
you know, gotten us to this point.

1255
00:47:37.533 --> 00:47:39.954
People often underestimate how harsh,

1256
00:47:39.954 --> 00:47:40.838
just like you were teasing me

1257
00:47:40.838 --> 00:47:42.877
about not being able to find food.

1258
00:47:42.877 --> 00:47:46.054
You're right, those are harsh environments,

1259
00:47:46.054 --> 00:47:49.414
and the bands that had the best teamwork

1260
00:47:49.414 --> 00:47:52.252
out competed the other bands for scarce resources.

1261
00:47:52.252 --> 00:47:54.192
And they're the ones who passed on their genes.

1262
00:47:54.192 --> 00:47:58.736
And we're the inheritors of this incredible gift to us.

1263
00:47:58.736 --> 00:48:01.456
That's one thing that I often think about, gratitude.

1264
00:48:01.456 --> 00:48:04.218
How we, on the day we were conceived,

1265
00:48:04.218 --> 00:48:08.208
we were given this extraordinary instruction set

1266
00:48:08.208 --> 00:48:11.344
for building this amazing three pounds

1267
00:48:11.344 --> 00:48:12.506
right between the ears,

1268
00:48:12.506 --> 00:48:15.547
which is the most complex object known to science,

1269
00:48:15.547 --> 00:48:17.402
with all these amazing capabilities.

1270
00:48:17.402 --> 00:48:18.820
That was just handed to us,

1271
00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:21.466
including all of our tendencies toward cooperation,

1272
00:48:21.466 --> 00:48:24.398
toward contentment, toward, you know, calm,

1273
00:48:24.398 --> 00:48:26.106
creativity, all those five C's.

1274
00:48:26.106 --> 00:48:28.259
Consciousness, and all the rest of that.

1275
00:48:28.259 --> 00:48:29.166
Fantastic!
<v Regina>Really, I mean,</v>

1276
00:48:29.166 --> 00:48:29.838
<v Regina>it's amazing, we know--</v>

1277
00:48:29.838 --> 00:48:31.641
<v ->It just makes me happy to think about it,</v>

1278
00:48:31.641 --> 00:48:33.220
and then it makes me want to be responsible

1279
00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:35.224
for using it well.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1280
00:48:35.224 --> 00:48:36.920
<v Rick>And help other people do the same thing.</v>

1281
00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.577
<v Regina>Well let's, before we wrap up this conversation,</v>

1282
00:48:39.577 --> 00:48:40.963
let's talk about one more area,

1283
00:48:40.963 --> 00:48:42.798
and you just brought this up,

1284
00:48:42.798 --> 00:48:45.965
and that's the notion of expanding the category

1285
00:48:45.965 --> 00:48:49.230
or notion of us.
<v Rick>Yeah.</v>

1286
00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:52.178
<v Rick>Well, in the world right now,</v>

1287
00:48:52.178 --> 00:48:53.928
we really, really need this.

1288
00:48:53.928 --> 00:48:56.227
In other words, when we were evolving,

1289
00:48:56.227 --> 00:48:59.425
us was my band of 5,200 people like me,

1290
00:48:59.425 --> 00:49:02.549
and everybody else was a them, pretty much.

1291
00:49:03.299 --> 00:49:06.793
Yet, now we're in a world where we're so interdependent.

1292
00:49:06.793 --> 00:49:08.969
Whereas I was listening to the radio earlier,

1293
00:49:08.969 --> 00:49:10.867
carbon released into the atmosphere

1294
00:49:10.867 --> 00:49:12.691
knows no national boundaries.

1295
00:49:12.691 --> 00:49:14.430
In other words, the whole planet is heating,

1296
00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:16.051
potentially catastrophically.

1297
00:49:16.051 --> 00:49:18.590
Most people really, truly do not understand

1298
00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:21.671
how close to the edge of catastrophic

1299
00:49:21.671 --> 00:49:24.809
runaway dynamics this planet really is.

1300
00:49:24.809 --> 00:49:25.928
Scientists understand it,

1301
00:49:25.928 --> 00:49:27.825
and they're talking about it all the time,

1302
00:49:27.825 --> 00:49:31.444
but many other people don't really understand that.

1303
00:49:31.444 --> 00:49:33.636
We really need, if we're gonna survive,

1304
00:49:33.636 --> 00:49:36.175
we're gonna survive, but if we're gonna flourish,

1305
00:49:36.175 --> 00:49:37.883
if we're gonna flourish as a species.

1306
00:49:37.883 --> 00:49:40.633
If our children and grandchildren are gonna have a world

1307
00:49:40.633 --> 00:49:44.037
that's livable, let alone a world that could be the world

1308
00:49:44.037 --> 00:49:46.959
that we could have, actually.

1309
00:49:46.959 --> 00:49:49.138
We are gonna have to become much more skillful

1310
00:49:49.138 --> 00:49:50.333
with our own brains.

1311
00:49:50.333 --> 00:49:51.357
Because it's our brain.

1312
00:49:51.357 --> 00:49:53.554
It's the caveman brain with nuclear weapons

1313
00:49:53.554 --> 00:49:56.542
that's ready to attack and exploit them

1314
00:49:56.542 --> 00:49:57.874
at the drop of a hat.

1315
00:49:57.874 --> 00:49:59.697
We have that inside our head.

1316
00:49:59.697 --> 00:50:02.567
I think part of the truth is to,

1317
00:50:02.567 --> 00:50:04.764
no matter how much psychology we have in our background,

1318
00:50:04.764 --> 00:50:06.663
no matter how many hours in the classroom we've clocked,

1319
00:50:06.663 --> 00:50:08.407
no matter how much, you know,

1320
00:50:08.407 --> 00:50:10.231
whatever it is that we've done,

1321
00:50:10.231 --> 00:50:13.214
we still have that capacity inside us.

1322
00:50:13.214 --> 00:50:15.635
If we don't regulate the wolf of hate,

1323
00:50:15.635 --> 00:50:17.512
so-called inside our own head,

1324
00:50:17.512 --> 00:50:22.512
and feed, and serve, and encourage the wolf of love,

1325
00:50:22.941 --> 00:50:26.173
you know, we'll have a world that'll be

1326
00:50:26.173 --> 00:50:27.901
in a very, very bad place.

1327
00:50:27.901 --> 00:50:30.460
<v Regina>So we have to begin seeing all of us as us.</v>

1328
00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:31.516
<v ->Yeah, exactly right.</v>

1329
00:50:31.516 --> 00:50:33.436
That's how I close the chapter there, as you know.

1330
00:50:33.436 --> 00:50:34.001
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1331
00:50:34.001 --> 00:50:36.241
<v ->To really see the whole world as us.</v>

1332
00:50:36.241 --> 00:50:38.993
Obviously we have to, you know, family's quarrel, squabble,

1333
00:50:38.993 --> 00:50:41.372
it's okay, but we don't have to pull out the guns

1334
00:50:41.372 --> 00:50:43.740
and put them away.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1335
00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:45.297
<v Regina>And let's finish on one note,</v>

1336
00:50:45.297 --> 00:50:47.174
because you referred to it a couple of times,

1337
00:50:47.174 --> 00:50:50.289
and it's a very sweet Native American story,

1338
00:50:50.289 --> 00:50:52.731
and that is about the wolf of hate

1339
00:50:52.731 --> 00:50:53.712
and the wolf of love.

1340
00:50:53.712 --> 00:50:54.694
Can you tell that story?

1341
00:50:54.694 --> 00:50:55.515
<v ->Oh, thank you.</v>

1342
00:50:55.515 --> 00:50:58.597
It touches my heart every single time I think about it.

1343
00:50:58.597 --> 00:51:01.067
It was told to me that a Native American elder,

1344
00:51:01.067 --> 00:51:04.495
a grandmother, was asked toward the end of her life

1345
00:51:04.495 --> 00:51:07.696
how she had become so wise, and so well-liked.

1346
00:51:07.696 --> 00:51:09.029
Everybody consulted with her,

1347
00:51:09.029 --> 00:51:10.960
they wanted her to come to all their parties,

1348
00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:14.725
she was just, really, a very admirable, admirable person

1349
00:51:14.725 --> 00:51:17.424
who had contributed so much to so many people

1350
00:51:17.424 --> 00:51:19.525
that they were very grateful for.

1351
00:51:19.525 --> 00:51:20.741
And so they asked her,

1352
00:51:20.741 --> 00:51:21.931
"Grandmother, how did you do it?

1353
00:51:21.931 --> 00:51:23.531
"How did you become who you are?"

1354
00:51:23.531 --> 00:51:27.968
She said, "Well, I know that in my heart are two wolves.

1355
00:51:27.968 --> 00:51:30.410
"One of love, and one of hate,

1356
00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:34.623
"and that everything depends on which one I feed each day."

1357
00:51:34.623 --> 00:51:37.504
<v Regina>Hmm, that says it, that's how we start</v>

1358
00:51:37.504 --> 00:51:40.810
reframing things and kind of fixing our own

1359
00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:42.804
suffering and pain in life, isn't it?

1360
00:51:42.804 --> 00:51:45.790
<v ->And one of the nice takeaways here as well</v>

1361
00:51:45.790 --> 00:51:48.510
is that little things really add up over time.

1362
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:50.185
If you just restrain the wolf of hate

1363
00:51:50.185 --> 00:51:52.190
a little bit more each day,

1364
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:54.163
and feed it less and less,

1365
00:51:54.163 --> 00:51:56.787
and if you just start nourishing the wolf of love

1366
00:51:56.787 --> 00:51:58.302
more and more each day,

1367
00:51:58.302 --> 00:52:00.585
and encouraging it to go out and play,

1368
00:52:00.585 --> 00:52:03.742
and to take some chances, and to really take in the good

1369
00:52:03.742 --> 00:52:06.568
when the chances you take turn out well.

1370
00:52:06.568 --> 00:52:09.149
If you just do that gradually over time,

1371
00:52:09.149 --> 00:52:10.621
you're firing those neurons,

1372
00:52:10.621 --> 00:52:13.042
therefore you're wiring those neurons,

1373
00:52:13.042 --> 00:52:15.645
you're creating more wholesome tendencies.

1374
00:52:15.645 --> 00:52:17.341
The Buddha saying is that,

1375
00:52:17.341 --> 00:52:19.922
"The mind takes the shape of what it rests upon."

1376
00:52:19.922 --> 00:52:23.143
If you increasingly rest the mind upon themes of love,

1377
00:52:23.143 --> 00:52:24.679
and you build up the inner strength,

1378
00:52:24.679 --> 00:52:27.367
and the assertiveness that enables you to sustain that,

1379
00:52:27.367 --> 00:52:29.928
then you build those capacities inside yourself.

1380
00:52:29.928 --> 00:52:32.060
You start creating wonderful, positive cycles

1381
00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:34.801
outside of you that nourish them further,

1382
00:52:34.801 --> 00:52:37.126
and you, you know, lead increasingly

1383
00:52:37.126 --> 00:52:39.985
in a direction where you feel happier, you feel more loving,

1384
00:52:39.985 --> 00:52:42.582
and you're more able to make this world a better place.

1385
00:52:42.582 --> 00:52:44.043
<v Regina>Well that's the best advice we can get,</v>

1386
00:52:44.043 --> 00:52:45.225
and just lest we think,

1387
00:52:45.225 --> 00:52:47.679
"Well, I'm normally very happy, I'm very positive,

1388
00:52:47.679 --> 00:52:51.018
"I don't really feed that wolf of hate."

1389
00:52:51.018 --> 00:52:52.180
You brought something up in your book

1390
00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:55.497
that was very simple, direct, and poignant,

1391
00:52:55.497 --> 00:52:58.377
and that is, you're embarrassed to admit

1392
00:52:58.377 --> 00:53:01.182
how much satisfaction you and most people get

1393
00:53:01.182 --> 00:53:04.020
watching a film to see the bad guy get it

1394
00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:05.321
in the end.
<v Rick>You betcha.</v>

1395
00:53:05.321 --> 00:53:06.483
Kill them in the end.
<v Rick>Mm-hmm.</v>

1396
00:53:06.483 --> 00:53:07.464
<v Regina>And that is</v>

1397
00:53:07.464 --> 00:53:09.001
the wolf of hate.
<v Rick>Wolf of hate.</v>

1398
00:53:09.001 --> 00:53:09.544
<v Rick>Yeah.</v>

1399
00:53:09.544 --> 00:53:11.198
<v Regina>So even to that degree,</v>

1400
00:53:11.198 --> 00:53:12.584
we have to be very diligent

1401
00:53:12.584 --> 00:53:14.344
about what we're nurturing, don't we?

1402
00:53:14.344 --> 00:53:15.943
<v ->That's correct, and understand that.</v>

1403
00:53:15.943 --> 00:53:18.865
I think a lot of people activate the wolf of hate

1404
00:53:18.865 --> 00:53:20.304
towards their wolf of hate.

1405
00:53:20.304 --> 00:53:22.524
In other words, they feel guilty about being aggressive,

1406
00:53:22.524 --> 00:53:24.945
or assertive, or angry sometimes.

1407
00:53:24.945 --> 00:53:26.991
Or they try to kill the wolf of hate inside,

1408
00:53:26.991 --> 00:53:29.649
but the act of killing feeds the wolf of hate,

1409
00:53:29.649 --> 00:53:30.993
so you can't do it.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1410
00:53:30.993 --> 00:53:33.755
<v Rick>The thing to do is to be aware of that,</v>

1411
00:53:33.755 --> 00:53:36.731
understand it, hold it with spaciousness,

1412
00:53:36.731 --> 00:53:38.555
and not act it out.

1413
00:53:38.555 --> 00:53:41.637
And in that moment, you're starving the wolf of hate.

1414
00:53:41.637 --> 00:53:42.512
And instead,
<v Regina>And then we can</v>

1415
00:53:42.512 --> 00:53:44.069
feed the wolf of love.
<v Regina>just feed, yes.</v>

1416
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:46.553
<v Regina>Well, can't end it any better than that.</v>

1417
00:53:46.553 --> 00:53:48.068
Rick, thank you so much
<v Rick>Oh, thank you.</v>

1418
00:53:48.068 --> 00:53:49.434
<v Regina>for taking the time to be with us.</v>

1419
00:53:49.434 --> 00:53:52.250
This is really a wonderful, as I said before,

1420
00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:54.853
handbook to our own brains and our own,

1421
00:53:54.853 --> 00:53:57.391
our own sense of peace and well being.

1422
00:53:57.391 --> 00:53:59.528
Beautifully done, thank you..
<v Rick>Thank you.</v>

1423
00:54:00.078 --> 00:54:01.615
<v ->You can pick up a copy of Buddha's Brain</v>

1424
00:54:01.615 --> 00:54:04.089
through Amazon or any other major bookseller.

1425
00:54:04.089 --> 00:54:05.497
It's a worthwhile journey.

1426
00:54:05.497 --> 00:54:07.854
Meanwhile, to hear other fascinating information

1427
