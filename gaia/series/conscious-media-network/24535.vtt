00:00:00.335 --> 00:00:02.939
<v ->I became interested in Dawson Church after reading</v>

2
00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.991
an article he wrote, called Personal Disarmament.

3
00:00:05.991 --> 00:00:08.259
It seems that if there were ever a time to disarm,

4
00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:10.639
it would be now, and not just for governments,

5
00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.123
but for individuals.

6
00:00:12.123 --> 00:00:13.887
According to Dawson, the key is to do

7
00:00:13.887 --> 00:00:17.023
whatever is necessary to interrupt the auto-programmed

8
00:00:17.023 --> 00:00:19.263
response we each have when our

9
00:00:19.263 --> 00:00:20.999
sensitivities are pushed.

10
00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:23.827
In the end, he says, it's up to every individual to take

11
00:00:23.827 --> 00:00:26.963
responsibility for diffusing our own hot buttons

12
00:00:26.963 --> 00:00:30.349
before this can reflect out to the world at large.

13
00:00:31.413 --> 00:00:33.219 line:15% 
(light orchestral music)

14
00:00:38.682 --> 00:00:40.531
You wrote a wonderful piece of work called,

15
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:43.667
Personal Disarmament and it is such an important

16
00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:46.130
subject of the day on many levels.

17
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.819
Globally and personally and everything in between.

18
00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:50.947
And when you set up this article,

19
00:00:50.947 --> 00:00:53.467
you started talking about two distinct types

20
00:00:53.467 --> 00:00:57.022
of people and one is the protester the other

21
00:00:57.022 --> 00:01:00.719
is the mystic, and let's start out there and why

22
00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.000
you began with those two kind of classic types

23
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.250
of individuals.

24
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.490
<v ->Well the mystic, of course, is at the pinnacle of</v>

25
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.039
every religion, and every religion has its mystics,

26
00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:11.894
and these are people who are focused on the interior

27
00:01:11.894 --> 00:01:14.751
life, they often withdraw from the world.

28
00:01:14.751 --> 00:01:17.550
They are people who have an intense focus on

29
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.022
embodying their scripture, and the protester

30
00:01:21.022 --> 00:01:23.402
on the other hand is somebody who has an intense

31
00:01:23.402 --> 00:01:26.875
focus on the outer world, and righting injustices and

32
00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:29.647
making changes in the outer world.

33
00:01:29.647 --> 00:01:31.831
And it seems at first glance as though there's very little

34
00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:34.491
for the mystic to talk to the protester about,

35
00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:36.450
and vice versa, so the activist, somebody who is

36
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.719
advocating for change in the outer world,

37
00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.603
is the opposite of the spectrum,

38
00:01:41.603 --> 00:01:44.010
and yet it turns out that,

39
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.119
these aren't so far apart after all.

40
00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.227
That as we produce genuine internal change

41
00:01:50.227 --> 00:01:52.607
within ourselves, it affects the outer world,

42
00:01:52.607 --> 00:01:54.007
in all kinds of ways.

43
00:01:54.007 --> 00:01:56.387
For example, the quality of our interactions

44
00:01:56.387 --> 00:01:59.327
with each other as we, for instance,

45
00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:03.742
are triggered, as our stress response is aroused,

46
00:02:04.902 --> 00:02:08.264
if we have some tools to release that

47
00:02:08.264 --> 00:02:11.932
and to calm ourselves, then suddenly the quality

48
00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:14.648
of our relationships, with our spouses,

49
00:02:14.648 --> 00:02:17.000
with our children, with our parents,

50
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.416
with our coworkers, with chance people we meet.

51
00:02:20.416 --> 00:02:23.300
How often have you maybe in your life,

52
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.660
had somebody just smile at you you didn't know?

53
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.592
And it changed your whole day.

54
00:02:28.592 --> 00:02:30.272
There's a wonderful story in one of my books about

55
00:02:30.272 --> 00:02:34.472
a guy who was at the end of his tether,

56
00:02:34.472 --> 00:02:38.952
and he was actually taking a walk to the

57
00:02:38.952 --> 00:02:41.958
plant to kill himself, and as he was walking

58
00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.978
along the sidewalk, he got to an intersection

59
00:02:44.978 --> 00:02:49.258
and he stopped at the intersection for a red light,

60
00:02:49.258 --> 00:02:53.687
and a woman in a car looked at him and held his eyes

61
00:02:53.687 --> 00:02:57.635
and smiled, and he changed his mind about killing himself.

62
00:02:57.635 --> 00:03:01.947
These chance interactions, as we learn to shift ourselves,

63
00:03:01.947 --> 00:03:04.019
can make an enormous difference in the world,

64
00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.791
so I no longer believe that there's a huge tension,

65
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:09.787
and that either you change yourself or you change the world,

66
00:03:09.787 --> 00:03:12.895
I now believe that by working on these inner change events,

67
00:03:12.895 --> 00:03:16.156
you indeed can have an enormous impact on society

68
00:03:16.156 --> 00:03:19.846
and you have no idea what that impact might be.

69
00:03:19.846 --> 00:03:23.686
I remember I have a daughter who's 30 years old now,

70
00:03:23.686 --> 00:03:26.507
and you ask kids what they did during the day,

71
00:03:26.507 --> 00:03:28.457
and they say, "nothing."

72
00:03:28.457 --> 00:03:31.966
And so one day after school I said to her,

73
00:03:31.966 --> 00:03:35.387
and she was 12 at the time, "Angela, what happened

74
00:03:35.387 --> 00:03:37.457
"today at school, what was your day like?"

75
00:03:37.457 --> 00:03:39.976
And she said, "nothing, nothing happened,"

76
00:03:39.976 --> 00:03:42.257
so I said, "Well Darling, do you know that

77
00:03:42.257 --> 00:03:45.916
"when I saw you in the kitchen this morning, before

78
00:03:45.916 --> 00:03:48.766
"you went to school, you threw your arms around me

79
00:03:48.766 --> 00:03:50.836
"and said how much you love me, and my whole

80
00:03:50.836 --> 00:03:52.516
"day was better because of that,"

81
00:03:52.516 --> 00:03:55.726
And she said, "oh yeah, I talked to Katie today,"

82
00:03:55.726 --> 00:03:58.576
And she went on to recount how she'd helped one

83
00:03:58.576 --> 00:04:00.467
friend of hers that day,

84
00:04:00.467 --> 00:04:02.956
and I said, "you know, Darling, you might have helped

85
00:04:02.956 --> 00:04:06.436
"12 people today through that, and I might have

86
00:04:06.436 --> 00:04:09.167
"helped 12 people have a better day as a result

87
00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:12.316
"of you shifting me this morning in the kitchen,

88
00:04:12.316 --> 00:04:15.167
"so you might, 12 times 12 have helped

89
00:04:15.167 --> 00:04:17.806
"and shifted 144 people at 12 years old

90
00:04:17.806 --> 00:04:20.997
"with no money." (laughs)

91
00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.089
Now that's influence, and so that's how,

92
00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:25.909
as we learn to live happy, unstressed,

93
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:28.251
relaxed lives, in tune with ourselves,

94
00:04:28.251 --> 00:04:31.371
we can have enormous influence on the world around us.

95
00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:33.499
<v Regina>And yet we are all fighting ourselves,</v>

96
00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:35.989
any little demons and outside voices that we may

97
00:04:35.989 --> 00:04:38.959
take offense to, for example, or actually only a reflection

98
00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:42.441
of our internal voice, is that partially true?

99
00:04:42.441 --> 00:04:45.529
And this is also patterned in our psychology,

100
00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:47.961
in our brains, through our neural nets, and how

101
00:04:47.961 --> 00:04:50.721
do we go about, let's talk about that for a moment,

102
00:04:50.721 --> 00:04:53.929
how we lay these programs down and I would love

103
00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:56.209
to follow up with how we go ahead and start

104
00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:58.279
breaking apart those programs.

105
00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:59.869
<v ->Yes, and unfortunately, those programs are very,</v>

106
00:04:59.869 --> 00:05:03.949
very, very difficult to change, and people will

107
00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.531
go for a retreat in a zen monastery,

108
00:05:06.531 --> 00:05:08.061
or a Christian monastery,

109
00:05:08.061 --> 00:05:10.461
and maybe be apart from the world for a week,

110
00:05:10.461 --> 00:05:12.711
be with a great saint and have some sort

111
00:05:12.711 --> 00:05:14.209
of shifting experience,

112
00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:16.789
but then go back, and the moment they get back

113
00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.909
to their office or their spouse or their child,

114
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:22.309
they're right back in their old patterns again,

115
00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:24.801
and these are very, very hard patterns to change.

116
00:05:24.801 --> 00:05:26.682
They're ingrained in our biochemistry,

117
00:05:26.682 --> 00:05:27.636
and it's like,

118
00:05:27.636 --> 00:05:32.016
if you like your coffee

119
00:05:32.016 --> 00:05:36.216
with say, four ounces of cream,

120
00:05:36.216 --> 00:05:38.225
and two scoops of sugar.

121
00:05:38.225 --> 00:05:41.038
If someone hands you a cup of coffee with six scoops

122
00:05:41.038 --> 00:05:43.500
of sugar and 12 ounces of cream,

123
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.030
you take one sip and you know right away

124
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.148
something's wrong.

125
00:05:47.148 --> 00:05:48.748
Our internal biochemistry is like this.

126
00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:51.756
It's layed down early in life, and so we all marvel

127
00:05:51.756 --> 00:05:54.380
at the person who stays in an abusive relationship.

128
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.028
And yet they get out of the relationship and they

129
00:05:58.028 --> 00:06:01.006
find another abuser, right away,

130
00:06:01.006 --> 00:06:02.828
or they become another abuser right away.

131
00:06:02.828 --> 00:06:05.102
Because they're used to the internal

132
00:06:05.102 --> 00:06:08.078
biochemistry of that, and if they try a healthy

133
00:06:08.078 --> 00:06:11.182
relationship, it's like sipping the wrong cup of coffee,

134
00:06:11.182 --> 00:06:13.388
so their internal biochemistry, they're wired

135
00:06:13.388 --> 00:06:16.910
both neurologically and biochemically to respond

136
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.652
to those types of situations, and a healthy

137
00:06:20.652 --> 00:06:24.588
experience actually literally feels wrong in their cells.

138
00:06:24.588 --> 00:06:27.756
<v Regina>It's not their experience.</v>

139
00:06:27.756 --> 00:06:29.486
It's not their resonance.

140
00:06:29.486 --> 00:06:31.020
<v ->It's not</v>

141
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Regina>And you use an example of if you are sending</v>

142
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.734
out a specific resonance it's no difference than a bell

143
00:06:34.734 --> 00:06:36.716
ringing that starts resonating through the other bells.

144
00:06:36.716 --> 00:06:38.444
<v ->Yes, absolutely, yeah.</v>

145
00:06:38.444 --> 00:06:41.606
And it's hard to change that note if we use that note

146
00:06:41.606 --> 00:06:45.030
our whole lives, we have this pattern laid out

147
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.206
early in our lives and we tend to repeat

148
00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:48.614
it over and over and over again,

149
00:06:48.614 --> 00:06:50.376
and if we interrupt it every once in awhile,

150
00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:53.222
with say, and enlightened experience, or reading

151
00:06:53.222 --> 00:06:55.942
a marvelous book, or a piece of music that shifts us,

152
00:06:55.942 --> 00:06:58.118
these are very temporary experiences, and we

153
00:06:58.118 --> 00:07:00.454
revert right back to the old biochemistry.

154
00:07:00.454 --> 00:07:03.174
So what I look for is therapies, and there are

155
00:07:03.174 --> 00:07:05.862
very, very, very few nowadays that can make

156
00:07:05.862 --> 00:07:08.038
permanent alterations in that biochemical baseline,

157
00:07:08.038 --> 00:07:10.822
I call it, that can permanently change your taste

158
00:07:10.822 --> 00:07:12.646
of the mix of coffee.

159
00:07:12.646 --> 00:07:14.982
<v Regina>Yes (laughs) and you actually quoted</v>

160
00:07:14.982 --> 00:07:16.646
Eckhart Tolle, I like this quote, it says,

161
00:07:16.646 --> 00:07:19.014
"we should be at least as interested

162
00:07:19.014 --> 00:07:21.446
"in our reactions as in the person

163
00:07:21.446 --> 00:07:25.030
"who created that reaction," right?

164
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.246
<v ->(laughs)</v>

165
00:07:26.246 --> 00:07:28.198
<v Regina>The incidents that created that reaction</v>

166
00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:29.798
now that's some wisdom and that's where you're

167
00:07:29.798 --> 00:07:31.814
coming from, that's what you're working with.

168
00:07:31.814 --> 00:07:35.078
How do we throw the brakes on,

169
00:07:35.078 --> 00:07:37.350
in that moment when someone has just hit

170
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.334
your hot button, how do we throw the brakes

171
00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:41.734
on long enough to actually have a chance of

172
00:07:41.734 --> 00:07:44.518
affecting a genuine shift?

173
00:07:44.518 --> 00:07:48.006
<v ->Well, the first thing is just to throw the brakes on.</v>

174
00:07:48.006 --> 00:07:51.590
If there's anything you can do to throw the brakes on,

175
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.240
do it, because in that moment when we feel urgently,

176
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.934
as if we have to act that way,

177
00:07:56.934 --> 00:07:58.150
there's no other option,

178
00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.462
we have to say this thing,

179
00:07:59.462 --> 00:08:00.806
we feel this pressing urgency,

180
00:08:00.806 --> 00:08:03.430
this is the stress response, biochemically driving us,

181
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.086
and we are incapable at that point of anything

182
00:08:06.086 --> 00:08:07.910
like intelligent action usually.

183
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.406
We're being governed by our fight or flight response,

184
00:08:10.406 --> 00:08:13.254
and as long as we're in the grip of that biochemistry

185
00:08:13.254 --> 00:08:15.046
it's quite hard to do anything,

186
00:08:15.046 --> 00:08:18.502
but if you pause for just a few minutes,

187
00:08:18.502 --> 00:08:21.062
all the cortisol your body's produced,

188
00:08:21.062 --> 00:08:23.654
the stress chemistry of cortisol, adrenaline

189
00:08:23.654 --> 00:08:25.254
and so on,

190
00:08:25.254 --> 00:08:26.822
that gets reabsorbed, those molecules are broken

191
00:08:26.822 --> 00:08:28.870
down and reabsorbed, so example if you say,

192
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.136
have an argument with somebody and you walk

193
00:08:32.136 --> 00:08:34.406
out of the office or walk out of the house,

194
00:08:34.406 --> 00:08:36.710
within 10, 20 minutes, you feel calm, that's because

195
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:40.456
your cortisol's being reabsorbed and being put to

196
00:08:40.456 --> 00:08:43.782
some good use, so if you can first stop yourself

197
00:08:43.782 --> 00:08:46.662
in any way, shape or form, walk out of the situation,

198
00:08:46.662 --> 00:08:49.894
do something to not say that word,

199
00:08:49.894 --> 00:08:51.910
or not respond the same way,

200
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.670
immediately you're ahead, so that's

201
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:57.382
half the battle is just don't say that thing

202
00:08:57.382 --> 00:09:00.006
that feels so urgent to you and in fact that urgency

203
00:09:00.006 --> 00:09:03.494
is a signal to you that your stress response is engaged,

204
00:09:03.494 --> 00:09:06.470
and when your stress response is engaged, your whole

205
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.646
cognitive function gets shut down,

206
00:09:08.646 --> 00:09:10.886
so you aren't thinking clearly and you're not in

207
00:09:10.886 --> 00:09:13.670
a position to offer anything of value to your spouse

208
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.134
or your coworker, or your child or your parent,

209
00:09:16.134 --> 00:09:18.886
so it's important to interrupt that pattern in some way,

210
00:09:18.886 --> 00:09:21.094
just stopping is the first thing.

211
00:09:21.094 --> 00:09:22.662
And then there are therapies.

212
00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:24.774
I'm working with several right now.

213
00:09:24.774 --> 00:09:27.558
Broadly, they're called energy psychology,

214
00:09:27.558 --> 00:09:30.886
and what they do, is they seem to have the effect

215
00:09:30.886 --> 00:09:34.022
of very, very quickly draining that emotional intensity

216
00:09:34.022 --> 00:09:35.479
behind the issue.

217
00:09:35.479 --> 00:09:38.071
One study we're doing right now is with Iraq veterans,

218
00:09:38.071 --> 00:09:40.247
people coming back from Iraq with post-traumatic

219
00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:42.743
stress syndrom, PTSD, and these people who

220
00:09:42.743 --> 00:09:46.615
often have witnessed some horrendous event,

221
00:09:46.615 --> 00:09:48.791
like civilians being killed,

222
00:09:48.791 --> 00:09:50.999
or the humvee in front of them being blown up

223
00:09:50.999 --> 00:09:52.631
with their friends inside,

224
00:09:52.631 --> 00:09:55.191
people with severe stress, which again,

225
00:09:55.191 --> 00:09:56.823
they repeat over and over and over again

226
00:09:56.823 --> 00:09:58.903
in their mind, and as they repeat it,

227
00:09:58.903 --> 00:10:01.367
we human beings can produce the stress response

228
00:10:01.367 --> 00:10:03.799
not based on the humvee blowing up in front of us

229
00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:07.799
two years ago, but thinking about that same experience

230
00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:11.191
over and over and over again, so we have elevated cortisol,

231
00:10:11.191 --> 00:10:14.967
so we become used to this oversecretion of cortisol,

232
00:10:14.967 --> 00:10:18.775
and we have this repetitive stress event in our body.

233
00:10:18.775 --> 00:10:21.975
And so to interrupt that is tough,

234
00:10:21.975 --> 00:10:25.815
so experimenting now with these veterans to see if

235
00:10:25.815 --> 00:10:28.023
we interrupt that stress event,

236
00:10:28.023 --> 00:10:30.327
in their mental processes,

237
00:10:30.327 --> 00:10:32.759
the bad things still happen but at least

238
00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:34.807
they've had all the stress attached to it,

239
00:10:34.807 --> 00:10:37.207
so draining that emotional intensity away from

240
00:10:37.207 --> 00:10:40.151
the experience doesn't negate the experience,

241
00:10:40.151 --> 00:10:42.487
but at least you don't have that same stress response,

242
00:10:42.487 --> 00:10:45.719
which is causing all these bad effects in your body.

243
00:10:45.719 --> 00:10:49.911
<v Regina>Let's take that out now into the family.</v>

244
00:10:49.911 --> 00:10:54.103
So one of these veterans comes home,

245
00:10:54.103 --> 00:10:56.247
he's reliving this event,

246
00:10:56.247 --> 00:10:58.967
now let's look at how that then begins having

247
00:10:58.967 --> 00:11:01.495
a ripple effect throughout family life,

248
00:11:01.495 --> 00:11:03.735
throughout society, and that's,

249
00:11:03.735 --> 00:11:05.751
since you brought it up we can use this.

250
00:11:05.751 --> 00:11:07.767
<v ->Hundreds of thousands of veterans came back</v>

251
00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:10.167
from Vietnam and America as a whole did

252
00:11:10.167 --> 00:11:11.863
very little to reabsorb them,

253
00:11:11.863 --> 00:11:14.775
in fact people spat on them in the street sometimes.

254
00:11:14.775 --> 00:11:17.399
And so as a society we did almost nothing to

255
00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:19.927
reintegrate them back into society.

256
00:11:19.927 --> 00:11:23.031
Now we'll have 150,000 or perhaps all told,

257
00:11:23.031 --> 00:11:26.519
maybe 400,000 people having cycled through Iraq,

258
00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:28.919
what do we do with these people?

259
00:11:28.919 --> 00:11:30.967
Many of whom will have pain,

260
00:11:30.967 --> 00:11:32.983
will have post-traumatic stress and so on.

261
00:11:32.983 --> 00:11:35.703
We have to, as a society, develop far better tools

262
00:11:35.703 --> 00:11:38.359
for doing this, that's why we are studying them.

263
00:11:38.359 --> 00:11:41.527
But if we can teach them to deal with that stress event

264
00:11:41.527 --> 00:11:45.271
that happened way back when, then they're much less

265
00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:48.727
likely to express that in the form of domestic violence,

266
00:11:48.727 --> 00:11:51.479
violence toward their kids, or dissociation or other things.

267
00:11:51.479 --> 00:11:53.399
So it's really important we start to treat those

268
00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:56.087
and develop a plan to treat this soon,

269
00:11:56.087 --> 00:11:58.519
and so what we're doing with these veterans

270
00:11:58.519 --> 00:12:00.745
is a technique called emotional freedom techniques,

271
00:12:00.745 --> 00:12:02.345
or EFT.

272
00:12:02.345 --> 00:12:05.065
And EFT just by using some very

273
00:12:05.065 --> 00:12:08.945
natural stress reduction gestures in an organized fashion,

274
00:12:08.945 --> 00:12:12.705
within a few seconds we find we can alter this

275
00:12:12.705 --> 00:12:14.545
cortisol balance in the body,

276
00:12:14.545 --> 00:12:17.265
and without any sort of thought or psychotherapy

277
00:12:17.265 --> 00:12:20.145
or medication or surgery, very, very quickly the

278
00:12:20.145 --> 00:12:22.465
stress response is released and eventually

279
00:12:22.465 --> 00:12:24.905
the person comes back to a base line of function.

280
00:12:24.905 --> 00:12:26.865
<v Regina>Yes, we interviews a man named</v>

281
00:12:26.865 --> 00:12:29.425
Phillip Montrose who has a couple

282
00:12:29.425 --> 00:12:32.585
of books out on EFT also, so I would refer

283
00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.785
our viewers at this point to also watch

284
00:12:34.785 --> 00:12:36.745
that interview, because he breaks down

285
00:12:36.745 --> 00:12:38.465
what you do, how it's done,

286
00:12:38.465 --> 00:12:40.185
and the technical elements of it.

287
00:12:40.185 --> 00:12:41.745
<v ->Does he show it on the video?</v>

288
00:12:41.745 --> 00:12:44.065
Does he as actually so you what to do? Good.

289
00:12:44.065 --> 00:12:46.345
<v Regina>Yes, he does, he shows you what to do.</v>

290
00:12:46.345 --> 00:12:48.105
So let's talk about--

291
00:12:48.105 --> 00:12:49.905
<v ->Let me just have one more word about that.</v>

292
00:12:49.905 --> 00:12:51.705
The basis of EFT is a series of

293
00:12:51.705 --> 00:12:54.425
points of our bodies which people touch naturally

294
00:12:54.425 --> 00:12:57.711
so if we're startled we might go (rapid inhale).

295
00:12:57.711 --> 00:13:00.271
Or you know, people if they're

296
00:13:00.271 --> 00:13:02.391
worried they might go like this.

297
00:13:02.391 --> 00:13:04.191
Or if they're startled, yes, right.

298
00:13:04.191 --> 00:13:06.711
Or, this sort of thing,

299
00:13:06.711 --> 00:13:08.511
and it turns out that these points, these points,

300
00:13:08.511 --> 00:13:11.231
these points, these points and these points

301
00:13:11.231 --> 00:13:14.831
are ones we naturally touch when we're under stress

302
00:13:14.831 --> 00:13:17.111
and think nothing of it, but it turns out,

303
00:13:17.111 --> 00:13:19.231
if we touch them and breathe,

304
00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:21.351
or tap them, or in some way move them

305
00:13:21.351 --> 00:13:25.591
physically in an organized way, suddenly

306
00:13:25.591 --> 00:13:28.631
the stress, the whole feeling of stress goes away.

307
00:13:28.631 --> 00:13:31.591
And it's quite amazing, if you're used to long courses

308
00:13:31.591 --> 00:13:34.191
of therapy, to just be able to touch a few of these

309
00:13:34.191 --> 00:13:36.111
natural stress reduction points and have

310
00:13:36.111 --> 00:13:38.511
your stress quickly dissipate.

311
00:13:38.511 --> 00:13:40.311
But it does indeed do so.

312
00:13:40.311 --> 00:13:42.391
<v Regina>It does and you actually are aware of,</v>

313
00:13:42.391 --> 00:13:44.991
or involved with other studies going on where this

314
00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:47.471
is actually being incorporated.

315
00:13:47.471 --> 00:13:49.431
<v ->Pain, yes.</v>

316
00:13:49.431 --> 00:13:51.471
<v Regina>can you talk about some of the studies</v>

317
00:13:51.471 --> 00:13:53.391
that are going on and also it's potential

318
00:13:53.391 --> 00:13:54.991
use in Britain right now?

319
00:13:54.991 --> 00:13:56.791
<v ->Yes, Britain, unlike the US,</v>

320
00:13:56.791 --> 00:13:58.911
Britain has a nationalized, nation wide

321
00:13:58.911 --> 00:14:01.271
health service run by the government,

322
00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:03.751
and it also operates at about half the cost

323
00:14:03.751 --> 00:14:06.069
of the American one, and insures everybody.

324
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:09.951
Right now there are two trials under way,

325
00:14:09.951 --> 00:14:12.951
or planned, in the national health service

326
00:14:12.951 --> 00:14:16.071
in England, for using EFT with elderly patients

327
00:14:16.071 --> 00:14:17.591
with pain patients.

328
00:14:17.591 --> 00:14:22.591
And what we're doing also with Kaiser Permanente

329
00:14:22.631 --> 00:14:26.191
one of the Kaiser hospitals in Ohio,

330
00:14:26.191 --> 00:14:28.031
is a study on pain.

331
00:14:28.031 --> 00:14:29.911
So we're taking people who can't be helped by,

332
00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:32.191
chronic pain patients who, basically the medical

333
00:14:32.191 --> 00:14:34.191
profession throws up their hands and can't

334
00:14:34.191 --> 00:14:36.831
help them anymore, trying EFT with them.

335
00:14:36.831 --> 00:14:39.671
And it turns out that we aren't working on the pain so much,

336
00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:42.191
but we're working on the underlying emotional

337
00:14:42.191 --> 00:14:44.751
causes below the pain, 'cause guess what,

338
00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:48.791
if you have pain, the chances are very, very good that

339
00:14:48.791 --> 00:14:50.791
something happening emotionally in your life,

340
00:14:50.791 --> 00:14:53.831
or that did happen earlier which is causing that pain,

341
00:14:53.831 --> 00:14:55.631
or resulting in that pain, for example,

342
00:14:55.631 --> 00:15:00.151
Kaiser did this study of 17,400 adults

343
00:15:00.151 --> 00:15:04.031
in the US and they looked at the correlation

344
00:15:04.031 --> 00:15:07.271
between adult diseases, cancer, hypertension,

345
00:15:07.271 --> 00:15:10.751
bone fractures, heart disease, looked at the relationship

346
00:15:10.751 --> 00:15:14.983
of all these diseases to early childhood wounding,

347
00:15:14.983 --> 00:15:19.421
emotional trauma and it found a striking correlation

348
00:15:19.421 --> 00:15:22.181
between people having early childhood trauma

349
00:15:22.181 --> 00:15:25.661
and a whole host of diseases as adults.

350
00:15:25.661 --> 00:15:28.543
If you had significantly high levels of these

351
00:15:28.543 --> 00:15:30.743
childhood negative experiences.

352
00:15:30.743 --> 00:15:33.263
For example, you are 30 times more likely

353
00:15:33.263 --> 00:15:36.021
to commit suicide, or attempt suicide if you're a man

354
00:15:36.021 --> 00:15:39.821
you're 4,600 times as likely to be an intravenous

355
00:15:39.821 --> 00:15:43.901
drug user, but across the board, bone fractures,

356
00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:46.941
diabetes, high correlation with early childhood stress.

357
00:15:46.941 --> 00:15:49.503
So it's important that we take these traumas,

358
00:15:49.503 --> 00:15:51.583
and teach people the tools, simple tools like

359
00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:53.821
these natural stress-reduction gestures

360
00:15:53.821 --> 00:15:56.141
to help them release these things and not be

361
00:15:56.141 --> 00:15:58.543
carrying around this load of suffering which may

362
00:15:58.543 --> 00:16:01.621
result in pain or all kinds of symptoms later on

363
00:16:01.621 --> 00:16:03.383
down the road.

364
00:16:03.383 --> 00:16:05.063
<v Regina>And a lot of people attribute this to,</v>

365
00:16:05.063 --> 00:16:06.703
well it's genetic.

366
00:16:06.703 --> 00:16:08.223
Hey my mother had the same thing,

367
00:16:08.223 --> 00:16:09.983
her hips were bad to and on and on.

368
00:16:09.983 --> 00:16:12.061
Another person you're along side,

369
00:16:12.061 --> 00:16:13.861
on the side is Bruce Lipton,

370
00:16:13.861 --> 00:16:16.063
and Bruce of course talks about a lot of this

371
00:16:16.063 --> 00:16:18.103
in Biology of Belief, but you also have done an

372
00:16:18.103 --> 00:16:20.341
awful lot of work dealing with

373
00:16:20.341 --> 00:16:23.423
the soul's nature, even before infancy,

374
00:16:23.423 --> 00:16:26.261
even in utero, haven't you done some of that work?

375
00:16:26.261 --> 00:16:28.103
<v ->Yes I have, I wrote a book called,</v>

376
00:16:28.103 --> 00:16:30.101
Communing with the Spirit of Your Unborn Child,

377
00:16:30.101 --> 00:16:32.503
and parenting really begins at that level,

378
00:16:32.503 --> 00:16:34.703
and I'm such a strong believer in the spiritual

379
00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:36.461
aspects of health and disease,

380
00:16:36.461 --> 00:16:39.463
because if we are just focusing on our body,

381
00:16:39.463 --> 00:16:44.181
the whole of current microbiology focuses

382
00:16:44.181 --> 00:16:46.423
on molecular targets,

383
00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:48.781
we're looking for a molecule to knock out

384
00:16:48.781 --> 00:16:50.823
or affect another molecule,

385
00:16:50.823 --> 00:16:52.543
but we don't function that way as people,

386
00:16:52.543 --> 00:16:54.141
we function as systems,

387
00:16:54.141 --> 00:16:55.983
so if you can reduce the stress on the whole system,

388
00:16:55.983 --> 00:16:58.223
or a subsystem of the human body,

389
00:16:58.223 --> 00:17:00.383
you can be affecting thousands or even

390
00:17:00.383 --> 00:17:02.423
hundreds of thousands of different substances

391
00:17:02.423 --> 00:17:04.583
at the same time, so we need

392
00:17:04.583 --> 00:17:06.821
to look broadly at how to bring spirit and soul

393
00:17:06.821 --> 00:17:08.981
how do we bring love into our lives?

394
00:17:08.981 --> 00:17:10.863
Bring forgiveness in?

395
00:17:10.863 --> 00:17:12.941
You can bring forgiveness in and change

396
00:17:12.941 --> 00:17:14.983
your biochemistry and change 20,000 proteins

397
00:17:14.983 --> 00:17:17.663
at the same time, rather than that molecular target,

398
00:17:17.663 --> 00:17:19.821
so our whole research forcus as a society is

399
00:17:19.821 --> 00:17:21.463
very limited.

400
00:17:21.463 --> 00:17:23.901
I love modern medicine, and biochemical

401
00:17:23.901 --> 00:17:25.663
medicine has many wonderful benefits for us,

402
00:17:25.663 --> 00:17:28.823
but if we are just focusing on those limited

403
00:17:28.823 --> 00:17:31.263
bits of our functioning, and ignoring the way we

404
00:17:31.263 --> 00:17:33.183
feel as human beings, then we're missing

405
00:17:33.183 --> 00:17:35.261
a big part of the picture, so bringing in spirituality

406
00:17:35.261 --> 00:17:39.611
love, altruism, altruism has huge health effects.

407
00:17:39.611 --> 00:17:42.131
Social connection has big health effects.

408
00:17:42.131 --> 00:17:44.659
Visualization, meditation, prayer.

409
00:17:44.659 --> 00:17:47.301
All of these things have what I call, epigenetic

410
00:17:47.301 --> 00:17:50.899
medical effects, because again, they are affecting our

411
00:17:50.899 --> 00:17:54.419
genes, they're sending signals to our genes that have

412
00:17:54.419 --> 00:17:57.979
various kinds of effects at the level of the gene.

413
00:17:57.979 --> 00:18:00.059
So they're outside of the gene,

414
00:18:00.059 --> 00:18:01.619
but they're affecting the gene.

415
00:18:01.619 --> 00:18:03.061
<v Regina>They're affecting the gene.</v>

416
00:18:03.061 --> 00:18:05.179
Can you go a little bit more into the work you did

417
00:18:05.179 --> 00:18:07.021
with the unborn children?

418
00:18:07.021 --> 00:18:11.249
<v ->Yes, well, I define parenting,</v>

419
00:18:11.249 --> 00:18:15.781
as the parents job is to connect with the soul

420
00:18:15.781 --> 00:18:18.861
of the child and to allow that soul to express

421
00:18:18.861 --> 00:18:22.181
fully through the child's heart, mind and body,

422
00:18:22.181 --> 00:18:24.941
that's my parenting definition and when you parent

423
00:18:24.941 --> 00:18:27.979
as though your job is to make that connection

424
00:18:27.979 --> 00:18:31.259
with the soul of this being, and then let that soul

425
00:18:31.259 --> 00:18:33.779
flow into expression,

426
00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:36.139
with unconditional love, no criticism,

427
00:18:36.139 --> 00:18:38.939
just acceptance of that soul, it's remarkable

428
00:18:38.939 --> 00:18:43.259
how that soul can blossom in that child's heart

429
00:18:43.259 --> 00:18:45.341
and mind and body.

430
00:18:45.341 --> 00:18:47.899
<v Regina>What are some personal observations</v>

431
00:18:47.899 --> 00:18:50.301
you've made where this is done properly?

432
00:18:50.301 --> 00:18:52.421
Do you have any kind of anecdotal stories?

433
00:18:52.421 --> 00:18:54.179
We love stories.

434
00:18:54.179 --> 00:18:55.659
<v ->Yes, many.</v>

435
00:18:55.659 --> 00:18:57.741
One thing I do, whenever I see a newborn baby,

436
00:18:57.741 --> 00:19:00.541
I look at that baby, you know that babies are

437
00:19:00.541 --> 00:19:03.219
sort of unfocused, babies look around like this,

438
00:19:03.219 --> 00:19:06.099
but if someone looks at them,

439
00:19:06.099 --> 00:19:08.901
and there's someone saying, "Hey, the world's a safe place."

440
00:19:08.901 --> 00:19:12.261
"It's full of love", and you shine that through your eyes,

441
00:19:12.261 --> 00:19:14.179
you'll see the baby like, open its eyes

442
00:19:14.179 --> 00:19:16.259
and look full startled, and may it'll smile,

443
00:19:16.259 --> 00:19:18.859
it will hold your eyes,

444
00:19:18.859 --> 00:19:23.859
so we can communicate that with children

445
00:19:24.059 --> 00:19:26.821
very readily and I find that with my own kids,

446
00:19:26.821 --> 00:19:29.819
I have three children and it's been an amazing

447
00:19:29.819 --> 00:19:33.899
voyage of discovery to be able to when I was sometimes

448
00:19:33.899 --> 00:19:37.819
unable to figure out, for example, my son with homework

449
00:19:37.819 --> 00:19:39.899
when he was about seven or eight,

450
00:19:39.899 --> 00:19:43.139
could not focus on his homework,

451
00:19:43.139 --> 00:19:45.779
nothing worked, rewards didn't work,

452
00:19:45.779 --> 00:19:47.221
punishment didn't work,

453
00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:49.419
he was a very distractable kid and nothing would

454
00:19:49.419 --> 00:19:52.219
help him focus, and so at my wit's end, I just sat there

455
00:19:52.219 --> 00:19:54.341
and did what we call in transpersonal psychology,

456
00:19:54.341 --> 00:19:56.541
you just focus on your soul,

457
00:19:56.541 --> 00:19:59.539
the other person's soul and you do thats of loops

458
00:19:59.539 --> 00:20:02.099
so rather than this level loop, you're going up there

459
00:20:02.099 --> 00:20:04.901
into the other person's soul, and asking the other

460
00:20:04.901 --> 00:20:08.261
person's soul, at a level far beyond the abilties

461
00:20:08.261 --> 00:20:11.141
of your own mind, "what's going on here?"

462
00:20:11.141 --> 00:20:14.661
And the message I got was, sit with him while

463
00:20:14.661 --> 00:20:16.619
he does his homework.

464
00:20:16.619 --> 00:20:19.101
And I thought, that's ridiculous, I'll waste my time

465
00:20:19.101 --> 00:20:21.299
as well as his if I sit with him,

466
00:20:21.299 --> 00:20:23.979
it doesn't make any sense to sit at the table with

467
00:20:23.979 --> 00:20:26.139
him as he does his homework.

468
00:20:26.139 --> 00:20:28.539
So then okay, I'll sit with him.

469
00:20:28.539 --> 00:20:31.901
And I just, we just sit down there, and be

470
00:20:31.901 --> 00:20:34.221
with him while he did his homework,

471
00:20:34.221 --> 00:20:37.059
and for whatever reason, it worked.

472
00:20:37.059 --> 00:20:40.139
Now this happened over and over again in parenting

473
00:20:40.139 --> 00:20:42.941
for me when I was at my wit's end,

474
00:20:42.941 --> 00:20:45.021
I couldn't think of any solutions as

475
00:20:45.021 --> 00:20:48.701
I'm a bright guy, sometimes and I could not

476
00:20:48.701 --> 00:20:50.539
figure things out.

477
00:20:50.539 --> 00:20:52.299
But just to be able to have a heart connection and a soul

478
00:20:52.299 --> 00:20:54.221
connection with a child.

479
00:20:54.221 --> 00:20:56.019
(mumbles) a child's misbehaving.

480
00:20:56.019 --> 00:20:58.019
Sometimes just sending a beam of heart energy

481
00:20:58.019 --> 00:21:00.621
and love to them and they straighten out

482
00:21:00.621 --> 00:21:02.699
without anything else being required,

483
00:21:02.699 --> 00:21:05.259
so if you have the resources of your heart,

484
00:21:05.259 --> 00:21:07.661
your soul your spirit, the child's spirit,

485
00:21:07.661 --> 00:21:10.421
you have an array of resources far beyond

486
00:21:10.421 --> 00:21:13.099
that of any parenting book you could ever read.

487
00:21:13.099 --> 00:21:15.741
I would invite any parent to give this a try.

488
00:21:15.741 --> 00:21:18.339
Just try connecting with the soul of the child,

489
00:21:18.339 --> 00:21:20.341
if the child's misbehaving,

490
00:21:20.341 --> 00:21:22.459
if the child's obstreperous,

491
00:21:22.459 --> 00:21:25.019
if you're having a hard time disciplining the child,

492
00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:27.341
again just focus on this heart connection and you

493
00:21:27.341 --> 00:21:29.179
might find messages.

494
00:21:29.179 --> 00:21:31.021
For example, one woman I talked to when I

495
00:21:31.021 --> 00:21:33.819
was writing this book, was a vegetarian

496
00:21:33.819 --> 00:21:36.981
and she tuned into her child's soul and felt the strong

497
00:21:36.981 --> 00:21:39.499
sense that she should be eating meat

498
00:21:39.499 --> 00:21:42.261
during the pregnancy, and it turned out that was

499
00:21:42.261 --> 00:21:44.499
the perfect thing to do,

500
00:21:44.499 --> 00:21:46.339
but if she had been just following her belief

501
00:21:46.339 --> 00:21:48.901
system, she wouldn't have done that.

502
00:21:48.901 --> 00:21:51.221
So you get access to a whole range of information

503
00:21:51.221 --> 00:21:53.861
intuitively this way, you don't have access to otherwise.

504
00:21:53.861 --> 00:21:56.581
<v Regina>And this is really the starting point</v>

505
00:21:56.581 --> 00:21:59.301
at how we begin to heal our societies, we start

506
00:21:59.301 --> 00:22:01.661
in the home, so let's take what we originally

507
00:22:01.661 --> 00:22:03.661
began with in terms of,

508
00:22:03.661 --> 00:22:05.779
you're now with your child and you and your child

509
00:22:05.779 --> 00:22:07.779
may not be on the same page, may not be on the

510
00:22:07.779 --> 00:22:09.739
same resonance and you have some acting out

511
00:22:09.739 --> 00:22:11.581
going on, on the part of the child.

512
00:22:11.581 --> 00:22:13.859
What about helping that child learn

513
00:22:13.859 --> 00:22:15.981
some of those same techniques you're

514
00:22:15.981 --> 00:22:17.739
talking about, maybe not EFT,

515
00:22:17.739 --> 00:22:20.059
but maybe just stopping and breathing

516
00:22:20.059 --> 00:22:22.181
or counting to 10, as you and

517
00:22:22.181 --> 00:22:24.219
Thomas Jefferson suggest

518
00:22:24.219 --> 00:22:26.141
(laughter)

519
00:22:26.141 --> 00:22:28.739
<v ->I think he said count to 100 if that doesn't work.</v>

520
00:22:28.739 --> 00:22:32.219
<v Regina>So would you say that it's never too early</v>

521
00:22:32.219 --> 00:22:35.899
to begin working with our children and learning

522
00:22:35.899 --> 00:22:38.899
how to find their own flashipoints and deal with them?

523
00:22:38.899 --> 00:22:41.421
Or is that something you really would wait and work

524
00:22:41.421 --> 00:22:43.539
on in yourself and maybe wait 'til a more

525
00:22:43.539 --> 00:22:45.421
mature time in life?

526
00:22:45.421 --> 00:22:48.021
<v ->I think you always start by</v>

527
00:22:48.021 --> 00:22:49.901
working on yourself, I have to say

528
00:22:49.901 --> 00:22:52.259
I believe it's in couple work,

529
00:22:52.259 --> 00:22:54.341
in social work, and work with children,

530
00:22:54.341 --> 00:22:56.299
parents, whatever.

531
00:22:56.299 --> 00:22:58.539
If you yourself are triggered,

532
00:22:58.539 --> 00:23:00.859
your ability, even neurologically to hear

533
00:23:00.859 --> 00:23:03.861
your best ideas, your highest wisdom,

534
00:23:03.861 --> 00:23:06.021
is severely impaired.

535
00:23:06.021 --> 00:23:08.979
So until you've been able to relax, then you're

536
00:23:08.979 --> 00:23:11.619
almost completely unable to deal with a child

537
00:23:11.619 --> 00:23:13.499
or any stress in your life.

538
00:23:13.499 --> 00:23:15.419
So the first thing to do, for example,

539
00:23:15.419 --> 00:23:17.139
I was married for 10 years, I used to joke that

540
00:23:17.139 --> 00:23:19.981
after I had a fight with my wife,

541
00:23:19.981 --> 00:23:22.499
I would realize pretty quickly that it was

542
00:23:22.499 --> 00:23:24.339
about 5% my fault, I knew it was 95% her fault,

543
00:23:24.339 --> 00:23:26.261
it was 5% my fault.

544
00:23:26.261 --> 00:23:30.221
After about two hours, I would realize, you know it

545
00:23:30.221 --> 00:23:32.459
was about 50/50, it was about 50% my fault,

546
00:23:32.459 --> 00:23:34.619
and about half her fault.

547
00:23:34.619 --> 00:23:38.539
By the next day I would realize it was about 95% my fault,

548
00:23:38.539 --> 00:23:41.819
and all she'd done was trigger some old wound

549
00:23:41.819 --> 00:23:45.341
or pattern in me that had resulted in this thing.

550
00:23:45.341 --> 00:23:49.499
So changing her is something I cannot do, but

551
00:23:49.499 --> 00:23:52.219
changing myself is something I can do,

552
00:23:52.219 --> 00:23:54.859
and if we're able to deactivate our own trigger,

553
00:23:54.859 --> 00:23:56.821
suddenly we can see clearly.

554
00:23:56.821 --> 00:23:59.541
Oh, you know, maybe I'll let that behavior of

555
00:23:59.541 --> 00:24:02.499
my child's go, it's not with the candle,

556
00:24:02.499 --> 00:24:05.261
but maybe I will pay attention to this one,

557
00:24:05.261 --> 00:24:07.259
this one has to straighten out,

558
00:24:07.259 --> 00:24:10.019
but don't treat every one with the same intensity,

559
00:24:10.019 --> 00:24:12.141
you can't make that sort of evaluation while

560
00:24:12.141 --> 00:24:14.019
you yourself are stressed.

561
00:24:14.019 --> 00:24:15.821
So I have people do EFT or another one,

562
00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:17.701
a wonderful one is called Tapas

563
00:24:17.701 --> 00:24:19.461
Acupuncture Technique, TAT.

564
00:24:19.461 --> 00:24:21.219
TAT works great.

565
00:24:21.219 --> 00:24:23.499
There are a whole bunch of these in my books,

566
00:24:23.499 --> 00:24:25.619
and on my website, so if you look at any of these

567
00:24:25.619 --> 00:24:27.899
techniques, they can help you de-stress,

568
00:24:27.899 --> 00:24:30.301
and once you're de-stressed, you can deal

569
00:24:30.301 --> 00:24:31.981
with your partner.

570
00:24:31.981 --> 00:24:34.221
Your partner may never change, your husband

571
00:24:34.221 --> 00:24:36.381
or your wife, may always be the same and have

572
00:24:36.381 --> 00:24:38.459
the same annoying characteristics,

573
00:24:38.459 --> 00:24:40.299
and you probably cannot change them,

574
00:24:40.299 --> 00:24:41.941
but you sure can change yourself,

575
00:24:41.941 --> 00:24:43.859
and once you do that, you can see what you can do

576
00:24:43.859 --> 00:24:46.021
creatively in the situation in the marriage,

577
00:24:46.021 --> 00:24:47.899
and in the child raising situation and to be

578
00:24:47.899 --> 00:24:49.859
really effective.

579
00:24:49.859 --> 00:24:51.499
<v Regina>And you also wrote,</v>

580
00:24:51.499 --> 00:24:53.341
which is something I like that continues this out

581
00:24:53.341 --> 00:24:55.659
into society at large and there was a comment in there.

582
00:24:55.659 --> 00:24:58.859
The collective reactivity of a nation of individually

583
00:24:58.859 --> 00:25:03.059
reactive people is very dangerous to the world.

584
00:25:03.059 --> 00:25:06.779
And let's look at the United States, and examples

585
00:25:06.779 --> 00:25:10.591
of countries that,

586
00:25:10.591 --> 00:25:13.141
can reasonably be said to be dangerous to the world

587
00:25:13.141 --> 00:25:14.821
and this point in time,

588
00:25:14.821 --> 00:25:16.581
and the US is one of them,

589
00:25:16.581 --> 00:25:18.221
we're taking on a very aggressive role at this time.

590
00:25:18.221 --> 00:25:20.341
And we are also looking at great polarization,

591
00:25:20.341 --> 00:25:22.739
really high reactivity within the population,

592
00:25:22.739 --> 00:25:24.901
within the media as opposed to say, Tibet.

593
00:25:24.901 --> 00:25:29.021
<v ->Yes, which responded passively</v>

594
00:25:29.021 --> 00:25:31.501
to the Chinese invasion in 1915,

595
00:25:31.501 --> 00:25:35.779
and another example, a really sad example

596
00:25:35.779 --> 00:25:38.541
is the war, that Israel fought with Hezbollah,

597
00:25:38.541 --> 00:25:42.259
last year where they, you know,

598
00:25:42.259 --> 00:25:44.299
Hezbollah (mumbles) soldiers,

599
00:25:44.299 --> 00:25:46.261
then Israel attacked into Lebanon,

600
00:25:46.261 --> 00:25:48.381
killed about two or three thousand Lebanese

601
00:25:48.381 --> 00:25:50.699
civilians, Hezbollah kept firing missiles back.

602
00:25:50.699 --> 00:25:53.501
And my prayer is that at some point,

603
00:25:53.501 --> 00:25:57.261
we can, rather than, again these national aggressions

604
00:25:57.261 --> 00:26:02.261
and hatreds, and the Bosnia situation, these are individual

605
00:26:02.461 --> 00:26:04.699
ones, writ large.

606
00:26:04.699 --> 00:26:06.981
These are individual projections that turn out to have

607
00:26:06.981 --> 00:26:10.141
terrible effects unless they're checked,

608
00:26:10.141 --> 00:26:12.461
and at some point, we as a world,

609
00:26:12.461 --> 00:26:15.779
clearly, absolutely must learn to release these,

610
00:26:15.779 --> 00:26:17.501
and we can.

611
00:26:17.501 --> 00:26:19.941
I'll give you an example from Kosovo.

612
00:26:19.941 --> 00:26:23.139
When the Serbian army was rampaging through Kosovo,

613
00:26:23.139 --> 00:26:25.181
killing many civilians,

614
00:26:25.181 --> 00:26:28.539
there was one village in which they separated the men

615
00:26:28.539 --> 00:26:32.059
and the boys from the women and the girls,

616
00:26:32.059 --> 00:26:34.819
they rounded them up into three locations,

617
00:26:34.819 --> 00:26:37.179
there was no single building big enough

618
00:26:37.179 --> 00:26:39.139
for all the men, so they round them up

619
00:26:39.139 --> 00:26:41.139
into three different locations,

620
00:26:41.139 --> 00:26:42.819
and they machine gun them all down,

621
00:26:42.819 --> 00:26:44.939
they just slaughtered them all.

622
00:26:44.939 --> 00:26:47.699
It so happened that there was one survivor

623
00:26:47.699 --> 00:26:50.699
in each of those cases who was in the middle

624
00:26:50.699 --> 00:26:53.501
of the group, and this one man had survived,

625
00:26:53.501 --> 00:26:55.461
so there were three men who'd survived

626
00:26:55.461 --> 00:26:57.221
this terrible massacre,

627
00:26:57.221 --> 00:27:01.101
and later on after this, a team of researchers

628
00:27:01.101 --> 00:27:05.461
went to Kosovo to work with some of these

629
00:27:05.461 --> 00:27:07.859
massacre survivors and they were doing these

630
00:27:07.859 --> 00:27:10.499
energy psychology techniques,

631
00:27:10.499 --> 00:27:12.941
these aren't just for your marriage or for your parenting.

632
00:27:12.941 --> 00:27:16.299
They've been used with people with severe traumas,

633
00:27:16.299 --> 00:27:19.261
they've been used in Rwanda with survivors

634
00:27:19.261 --> 00:27:21.539
in the massacres there.

635
00:27:21.539 --> 00:27:24.419
And so they had to work with this one man who survived,

636
00:27:24.419 --> 00:27:27.419
they had to work on the sound of the gunfire,

637
00:27:27.419 --> 00:27:30.021
the screams of his dying companions,

638
00:27:30.021 --> 00:27:32.299
they had to work on the color

639
00:27:32.299 --> 00:27:34.501
of the Serbian Army uniforms,

640
00:27:34.501 --> 00:27:37.259
they had to work on (mumbles) bit by bit by bit,

641
00:27:37.259 --> 00:27:39.099
but that man,

642
00:27:39.099 --> 00:27:41.101
in a one year follow-up was found to have

643
00:27:41.101 --> 00:27:43.021
substantially recovered.

644
00:27:43.021 --> 00:27:45.181
He still had the terrible memories, but they werent

645
00:27:45.181 --> 00:27:49.059
they weren't at that high level of producing cortisol

646
00:27:49.059 --> 00:27:51.021
in his body every single day,

647
00:27:51.021 --> 00:27:52.739
as he would re-live them.

648
00:27:52.739 --> 00:27:55.341
So these sorts of techniques, if we, say,

649
00:27:55.341 --> 00:27:57.581
could send teams of peacekeepers into potential

650
00:27:57.581 --> 00:27:59.939
conflict zones, could have a huge effect,

651
00:27:59.939 --> 00:28:02.621
and I'm hoping that in a future time,

652
00:28:02.621 --> 00:28:05.179
say when three Israeli soldiers are kidnapped

653
00:28:05.179 --> 00:28:07.181
on the border of Lebanon,

654
00:28:07.181 --> 00:28:09.141
we would have teams of peacekeepers go in

655
00:28:09.141 --> 00:28:11.021
beforehand, work on people,

656
00:28:11.021 --> 00:28:12.659
help them release their stress,

657
00:28:12.659 --> 00:28:15.139
and so suddenly these national hatreds couldn't

658
00:28:15.139 --> 00:28:17.739
suddenly become conflagrations that kill

659
00:28:17.739 --> 00:28:20.339
thousands of innocent people.

660
00:28:20.339 --> 00:28:22.261
<v Regina>So again, it's back to us,</v>

661
00:28:22.261 --> 00:28:24.699
back to us as individuals, our families, collectively,

662
00:28:24.699 --> 00:28:28.341
as societies, we have to begin looking at our own

663
00:28:28.341 --> 00:28:30.339
trigger points

664
00:28:30.339 --> 00:28:32.099
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

665
00:28:32.099 --> 00:28:34.659
<v Regina>And this goes really even into John Hagelin's</v>

666
00:28:34.659 --> 00:28:38.139
work, you're looking at diffusing the reactivity,

667
00:28:38.139 --> 00:28:41.821
which is huge, it's huge, like you say,

668
00:28:41.821 --> 00:28:44.299
you can feel great in a seminar,

669
00:28:44.299 --> 00:28:46.499
like this lovely seminar all week long,

670
00:28:46.499 --> 00:28:48.219
and then you go home, and you get in a fight

671
00:28:48.219 --> 00:28:50.139
with your sweetie or whatever,

672
00:28:50.139 --> 00:28:51.979
and it's all back to square one.

673
00:28:51.979 --> 00:28:53.941
So what you're adding to this picture

674
00:28:53.941 --> 00:28:55.939
is absolutely essential.

675
00:28:55.939 --> 00:28:57.861
And as John Hagelin and a lot of those

676
00:28:57.861 --> 00:28:59.941
experiments have shown,

677
00:28:59.941 --> 00:29:01.421
that when you have people that have

678
00:29:01.421 --> 00:29:03.339
peace in their hearts,

679
00:29:03.339 --> 00:29:05.179
and of course this extends out into the field,

680
00:29:05.179 --> 00:29:06.939
and you talk about it even in the paper,

681
00:29:06.939 --> 00:29:08.781
the Personal Disarmament,

682
00:29:08.781 --> 00:29:11.419
about the tipping point, so to speak,

683
00:29:11.419 --> 00:29:13.619
Like you say, it doesn't take 51% of the people

684
00:29:13.619 --> 00:29:16.139
to have diffused their hot buttons.

685
00:29:16.139 --> 00:29:19.139
Would you continue on that a bit.

686
00:29:19.139 --> 00:29:21.339
<v ->Yes, it takes only a small amount of people</v>

687
00:29:21.339 --> 00:29:23.739
before radical social change occurs.

688
00:29:23.739 --> 00:29:27.821
The example I give as well there is that when I

689
00:29:27.821 --> 00:29:29.619
first came to the US 30 years ago,

690
00:29:29.619 --> 00:29:31.779
the Soviet Union and the US were poised,

691
00:29:31.779 --> 00:29:34.459
on the brink of nuclear war.

692
00:29:34.459 --> 00:29:37.339
Yuri Andropov, head of the polit bureau,

693
00:29:37.339 --> 00:29:39.739
and Ronald Reagan were,

694
00:29:39.739 --> 00:29:42.221
I mean they were bitter enemies.

695
00:29:42.221 --> 00:29:44.499
Andropov cut,

696
00:29:44.499 --> 00:29:46.541
most of us have a phone line in our home,

697
00:29:46.541 --> 00:29:49.101
and we also have an internet connection,

698
00:29:49.101 --> 00:29:50.861
we have two phone lines,

699
00:29:50.861 --> 00:29:54.461
Andropov cut all the phone lines between the USSR

700
00:29:54.461 --> 00:29:57.299
and the USA except for two, there were two

701
00:29:57.299 --> 00:29:59.859
lines available between the two countries,

702
00:29:59.859 --> 00:30:01.821
cut most communication,

703
00:30:01.821 --> 00:30:03.701
cut most cultural contacts,

704
00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:05.379
so we had these two beligerent people,

705
00:30:05.379 --> 00:30:07.339
they couldn't even talk to each other.

706
00:30:07.339 --> 00:30:09.141
Terrible situation,

707
00:30:09.141 --> 00:30:12.021
and I watched as the whole society went

708
00:30:12.021 --> 00:30:14.581
from this terrible state of threat and

709
00:30:14.581 --> 00:30:18.261
mutually assured destruction to I felt as though

710
00:30:18.261 --> 00:30:21.299
we decided not to blow ourselves up at that moment.

711
00:30:21.299 --> 00:30:24.979
It took a few people marching, protesting,

712
00:30:24.979 --> 00:30:27.581
offering alternatives.

713
00:30:27.581 --> 00:30:30.059
It took people, I actually flew with a team,

714
00:30:30.059 --> 00:30:32.781
a medical team, to Russia, we just wanted

715
00:30:32.781 --> 00:30:34.419
to talk to people, (mumbles),

716
00:30:34.419 --> 00:30:36.739
there are no official contacts going on,

717
00:30:36.739 --> 00:30:38.219
we will fly out there,

718
00:30:38.219 --> 00:30:39.861
we will meet with the neurosurgeons,

719
00:30:39.861 --> 00:30:41.581
we will meet with doctors,

720
00:30:41.581 --> 00:30:43.219
we will form person-to-person contacts

721
00:30:43.219 --> 00:30:45.019
to build these bridges,

722
00:30:45.019 --> 00:30:46.541
and guess what, after about 10 years,

723
00:30:46.541 --> 00:30:48.141
the Soviet Union had begun to crumble

724
00:30:48.141 --> 00:30:50.379
partly as a result of huge social mind change,

725
00:30:50.379 --> 00:30:53.621
so these huge mind changes do occur,

726
00:30:53.621 --> 00:30:56.141
and it is possible for society.

727
00:30:56.141 --> 00:30:59.181
England, Great Britain, used to,

728
00:30:59.181 --> 00:31:00.979
Brittania rules the way, you know.

729
00:31:00.979 --> 00:31:02.459
We used to think of ourselves as

730
00:31:02.459 --> 00:31:04.699
masters of the universe, but now I think

731
00:31:04.699 --> 00:31:08.139
most people look at some of the

732
00:31:08.139 --> 00:31:11.341
valuable things we do, and can see a big

733
00:31:11.341 --> 00:31:14.299
shift in social consciousness, and awareness.

734
00:31:14.299 --> 00:31:16.941
I think these shifts are possible,

735
00:31:16.941 --> 00:31:19.941
when they're boiling, they tend to not

736
00:31:19.941 --> 00:31:22.019
be that visible, and then suddenly

737
00:31:22.019 --> 00:31:23.939
they crystalize out and catalyze out.

738
00:31:23.939 --> 00:31:26.299
A society like Sweden used to be a warlike

739
00:31:26.299 --> 00:31:28.901
society, now it's regarded as one of the most

740
00:31:28.901 --> 00:31:31.259
pacifist societies and democratic societies

741
00:31:31.259 --> 00:31:33.101
in the world, so it's possible even for people

742
00:31:33.101 --> 00:31:35.419
who have, with good child rearing,

743
00:31:35.419 --> 00:31:37.741
when you start to raise your child without

744
00:31:37.741 --> 00:31:40.139
punishment, without arbitrary education.

745
00:31:40.139 --> 00:31:44.179
When a society shifts, suddenly, that society becomes,

746
00:31:44.179 --> 00:31:46.619
as if I am at peace, I'm not a threat to you,

747
00:31:46.619 --> 00:31:49.421
whereas if I'm all riled up, I am a threat to you.

748
00:31:49.421 --> 00:31:53.261
If a society itself has been able to shift its

749
00:31:53.261 --> 00:31:55.459
emotional balance point,

750
00:31:55.459 --> 00:31:57.501
then suddenly it no longer is a threat to those around it,

751
00:31:57.501 --> 00:32:00.499
so on a global scale it's possible for this to happen.

752
00:32:00.499 --> 00:32:04.059
And it's not just possible it's essential,

753
00:32:04.059 --> 00:32:06.419
it's absolutely essential we reach this point

754
00:32:06.419 --> 00:32:08.499
which is absolutely critical it happen,

755
00:32:08.499 --> 00:32:10.421
and it happen very very soon.

756
00:32:10.421 --> 00:32:13.179
So I think no one doubts that we're in a make or break

757
00:32:13.179 --> 00:32:15.819
century, we're at a make or break time

758
00:32:15.819 --> 00:32:19.379
in human history, and I've had the

759
00:32:19.379 --> 00:32:22.699
whimsical thought of applying to the EPA to put

760
00:32:22.699 --> 00:32:25.661
homo sapiens on the endangered species act

761
00:32:25.661 --> 00:32:27.939
because it's pretty clear, unless we do something.

762
00:32:27.939 --> 00:32:30.301
(laughs)

763
00:32:30.301 --> 00:32:32.421
We're history.

764
