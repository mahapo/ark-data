00:00:00.504 --> 00:00:03.606
<v ->Boris Fritz's background is in nanotechnology,</v>

2
00:00:03.606 --> 00:00:05.807
including technologies that you might only read about

3
00:00:05.807 --> 00:00:07.320
in science fiction.

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.028
But to understand this technology

5
00:00:09.028 --> 00:00:11.628
requires a deep understanding of energy.

6
00:00:11.628 --> 00:00:14.562
Boris's path to the understanding of subtle nuances

7
00:00:14.562 --> 00:00:17.090
of energies goes back four decades,

8
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.278
when he began yoga and meditation.

9
00:00:19.278 --> 00:00:21.306
This passion took him deep into the studies

10
00:00:21.306 --> 00:00:24.358
of the Yugas, or great cycles of history.

11
00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:27.413
Cycles that raise our consciousness as a species.

12
00:00:28.742 --> 00:00:33.499
(Eastern flute music)

13
00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:39.340
As people go through Sunday school,

14
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.600
in the Christian tradition for example,

15
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.392
and look at the notion of miracles,

16
00:00:46.392 --> 00:00:48.856
a lot of it seems to be relegated to just that,

17
00:00:48.856 --> 00:00:51.113
seemingly impossible events

18
00:00:51.113 --> 00:00:53.173
that have taken place historically,

19
00:00:53.173 --> 00:00:55.873
that maybe are myth in a lot of cases.

20
00:00:55.873 --> 00:00:58.371
But what you're saying in your study of the Yugas,

21
00:00:58.371 --> 00:01:00.942
and let's talk about that for a moment first,

22
00:01:00.942 --> 00:01:04.014
the Yuga cycles that occur,

23
00:01:04.014 --> 00:01:06.147
is that it's actually something based

24
00:01:06.147 --> 00:01:09.412
quite matter-of-factly in reality.

25
00:01:09.412 --> 00:01:11.927
So let's talk, please tell us about the Yugas,

26
00:01:11.927 --> 00:01:14.202
and the cycles of learning, just briefly

27
00:01:14.202 --> 00:01:16.687
before we get into some specifics.

28
00:01:16.687 --> 00:01:21.175
<v ->Ok, the Yuga is basically, Yuga means cycle,</v>

29
00:01:21.175 --> 00:01:23.949
and we're talking about a 24,000 cycle,

30
00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:27.021
based on the procession of the equinox.

31
00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:31.192
And ancient civilizations, in fact,

32
00:01:31.192 --> 00:01:34.867
some 30 ancient civilizations all agree

33
00:01:34.867 --> 00:01:37.139
that the ages of man are related

34
00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:40.350
to this 24,000 year cycle.

35
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.667
And what's interesting is that,

36
00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:46.899
a lot of that information has been put together

37
00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.283
by Giorgio de Santillana,

38
00:01:51.423 --> 00:01:52.599
wrote a book,

39
00:01:55.396 --> 00:01:56.828
and he was a professor

40
00:01:56.828 --> 00:02:00.790
of history of science at MIT.

41
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.557
<v Woman>Mm-hmm, very prestigious.</v>

42
00:02:02.557 --> 00:02:06.056
<v ->And so, the book was called Hamlet's Mill.</v>

43
00:02:06.056 --> 00:02:10.031
And so, it's very recognized that someone like that,

44
00:02:10.031 --> 00:02:12.118
of that stature, would talk about

45
00:02:12.118 --> 00:02:14.274
these ancient civilizations all agreeing

46
00:02:14.274 --> 00:02:17.079
on this kind of subject, so the idea is that

47
00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.637
we should take this seriously

48
00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:21.349
if all these ancient civilizations agreed

49
00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.722
that this cycle was happening,

50
00:02:25.722 --> 00:02:30.405
and that if affected how we evolved,

51
00:02:30.405 --> 00:02:33.896
24,000 years, that is 12,000 years upward,

52
00:02:33.896 --> 00:02:35.549
12,000 years downward.

53
00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.056
And it's not like a cycle like this,

54
00:02:38.056 --> 00:02:40.584
but it's really like a spiral because,

55
00:02:40.584 --> 00:02:44.541
in ancient India, the history there,

56
00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:47.048
they have retained much of this knowledge,

57
00:02:47.048 --> 00:02:49.451
more than anywhere else.

58
00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:51.826
And so the beauty of it is that--

59
00:02:51.826 --> 00:02:52.725
<v Woman>To the very description--</v>

60
00:02:52.725 --> 00:02:55.466
<v ->They're really cycles within cycles,</v>

61
00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:59.018
and the only cycle that makes sense to us is a smaller one,

62
00:02:59.018 --> 00:03:02.517
the 24,000 year cycle, where we can actually see things,

63
00:03:02.517 --> 00:03:03.909
through history.

64
00:03:04.822 --> 00:03:09.003
And also, interestingly, Plato speaks about these cycles,

65
00:03:09.003 --> 00:03:12.311
that's how most people know about the Golden Age,

66
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:15.143
they've heard of the Silver, the Bronze, and the Iron Age,

67
00:03:15.143 --> 00:03:16.627
that comes through Plato,

68
00:03:16.627 --> 00:03:20.392
and that's equivalent to the cycles in India,

69
00:03:20.392 --> 00:03:24.040
and all these other civilizations.

70
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.568
<v Woman>And Plato's writings</v>

71
00:03:26.568 --> 00:03:30.718
on the lost civilization, that is known as Atlantis now,

72
00:03:30.718 --> 00:03:31.521
for example.

73
00:03:31.521 --> 00:03:32.605
<v ->Right, he talk about Atlantis, and he also talks</v>

74
00:03:32.605 --> 00:03:34.813
about the ages and that Atlantis was happening

75
00:03:34.813 --> 00:03:36.843
during the Golden Age.

76
00:03:36.843 --> 00:03:39.815
And also, when he spoke with the priests,

77
00:03:39.815 --> 00:03:42.817
the Egyptian priests where he got this knowledge,

78
00:03:42.817 --> 00:03:46.838
the Egyptians told him, and I'll try to sort of quote it,

79
00:03:46.838 --> 00:03:49.765
but the Egyptian priests told him

80
00:03:49.765 --> 00:03:52.481
that you Greeks are like children,

81
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:56.076
you have completely forgotten the higher ages,

82
00:03:56.076 --> 00:03:57.356
you don't know what it was like,

83
00:03:57.356 --> 00:03:59.628
and how many cycles we've been through,

84
00:03:59.628 --> 00:04:02.113
and that how we have to go again

85
00:04:02.113 --> 00:04:04.182
through a lower cycle,

86
00:04:04.182 --> 00:04:06.983
and begin all over again like children.

87
00:04:08.034 --> 00:04:10.816
So they had that knowledge still,

88
00:04:10.816 --> 00:04:13.757
and that's what you're going to get towards, I know,

89
00:04:13.757 --> 00:04:14.747
with the Egyptians.

90
00:04:14.747 --> 00:04:16.507
<v Woman>That's, yes, absolutely.</v>

91
00:04:16.507 --> 00:04:18.826
<v ->But, I should also mention a little bit</v>

92
00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:20.639
of what were some of these ages like,

93
00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.049
and what did we see in them.

94
00:04:23.049 --> 00:04:24.759
How are they characterized?

95
00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.743
And as I mentioned in ancient Vedic texts,

96
00:04:27.743 --> 00:04:30.538
or Indian texts, there's a lot of information

97
00:04:30.538 --> 00:04:33.695
that they've retained, that make us understand

98
00:04:33.695 --> 00:04:36.522
what all this means.

99
00:04:36.522 --> 00:04:41.279
And one of the ones I like to talk about is,

100
00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:45.220
the four illusions that cover the infinity of God,

101
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.663
that they speak about in Ancient India,

102
00:04:47.663 --> 00:04:51.215
which refer to these four ages.

103
00:04:51.215 --> 00:04:54.308
You have the four ages going up, the four ages going down.

104
00:04:54.308 --> 00:04:57.038
So what happens in the Dark Age,

105
00:04:57.038 --> 00:04:59.939
what is the most that you can attain in the Dark Age?

106
00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:04.259
Well, I'm only talking about this one Vedic key,

107
00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.958
in this instant, of those four ideas

108
00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.560
that cover the infinity of God.

109
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.554
And they're illusions, and they're really the four ideas

110
00:05:13.554 --> 00:05:17.735
that really give rise to creation, give rise to duality.

111
00:05:17.735 --> 00:05:20.493
And they're basically the atom,

112
00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:25.982
space, time, and vibration.

113
00:05:25.982 --> 00:05:28.552
And out of that, all creation comes.

114
00:05:28.552 --> 00:05:29.491
<v Woman>Yes, mm-hmm.</v>

115
00:05:29.491 --> 00:05:32.094
<v ->And any one of those interrelates with the others,</v>

116
00:05:32.094 --> 00:05:35.082
but, in terms of understanding the four ages,

117
00:05:35.082 --> 00:05:39.339
the idea is that in the Iron Age,

118
00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:43.616
you have what's called on with the atom,

119
00:05:43.616 --> 00:05:47.765
but what it means is, solidity.

120
00:05:47.765 --> 00:05:51.317
The material existence, that people are only aware

121
00:05:51.317 --> 00:05:54.644
of their bodies and not aware of the inner forces

122
00:05:54.644 --> 00:05:56.404
that come in the higher ages.

123
00:05:56.404 --> 00:06:00.447
So the most that people can do in the Iron Age,

124
00:06:00.447 --> 00:06:03.783
is understand architecture

125
00:06:03.783 --> 00:06:06.620
and mechanistic kind of things.

126
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.151
Like they can have fairly complex mechanistic processes,

127
00:06:10.151 --> 00:06:12.309
but that's it.

128
00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:13.652
<v Woman>At this point would you go ahead</v>

129
00:06:13.652 --> 00:06:15.346
and put that in context to where we are

130
00:06:15.346 --> 00:06:16.441
at this cycle in history?

131
00:06:16.441 --> 00:06:19.905
<v ->Right, the downgoing Dark Age</v>

132
00:06:19.905 --> 00:06:24.905
from 700 BC, down to 500 AD,

133
00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:27.145
and 500 AD was the rock bottom

134
00:06:27.145 --> 00:06:29.769
of that whole 24,000 year cycle.

135
00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:33.150
And then we started to go in the ascending Dark Age,

136
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.702
from 500 to about 1600.

137
00:06:36.702 --> 00:06:39.358
There's a transition there, 15 to 1600,

138
00:06:39.358 --> 00:06:40.958
where a lot of things started happening--

139
00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:41.726
<v Woman>Renaissance, yeah.</v>

140
00:06:41.726 --> 00:06:45.256
<v ->A lot of energy, and Columbus discovering America,</v>

141
00:06:45.256 --> 00:06:47.432
and Magellan going around the globe

142
00:06:47.432 --> 00:06:50.472
21 years after that.

143
00:06:50.472 --> 00:06:52.460
You have the Renaissance, you have science,

144
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.066
all these things starting to happen,

145
00:06:55.066 --> 00:06:58.190
along with the transition into the Bronze Age

146
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.706
there from 17 to 1900.

147
00:07:00.706 --> 00:07:05.580
And then once you hit 1900, you're really in the Bronze Age

148
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:06.744
of this concept.

149
00:07:06.744 --> 00:07:07.767
<v Woman>And what are the characteristics</v>

150
00:07:07.767 --> 00:07:08.792
of the Bronze Age?

151
00:07:08.792 --> 00:07:11.832
<v ->Right, and that is where we go from</v>

152
00:07:11.832 --> 00:07:16.643
the materialistic aspect, we go to space.

153
00:07:16.643 --> 00:07:19.011
I mentioned space as being the second one,

154
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:21.144
and what that means is, first of all,

155
00:07:21.144 --> 00:07:25.506
we begin to realize, that the solidity of this world,

156
00:07:25.506 --> 00:07:29.506
is a illusion, that really it's mostly space.

157
00:07:29.506 --> 00:07:31.660
The atom, once we begin to see it,

158
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.678
is almost nothing but space,

159
00:07:33.678 --> 00:07:36.259
and what there is of solidity, really,

160
00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:38.648
like my hand going through this,

161
00:07:38.648 --> 00:07:42.851
it doesn't go through this chair, not because of solidity,

162
00:07:42.851 --> 00:07:46.168
but because of electromagnetic vibration.

163
00:07:46.168 --> 00:07:48.450
You know, the electrons are interacting,

164
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.885
they're repelling each other, and so there is no solidity.

165
00:07:51.885 --> 00:07:54.333
So we're in the state of space, and not only that,

166
00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:56.514
but what it means is that,

167
00:07:56.514 --> 00:07:58.574
in terms of the Vedic seer and things,

168
00:07:58.574 --> 00:08:00.568
the way we understand things,

169
00:08:00.568 --> 00:08:04.941
is that space also refers to the idea that,

170
00:08:07.261 --> 00:08:10.462
in terms of distance, overcoming distance,

171
00:08:10.462 --> 00:08:13.758
and so the telegraph, then we have the telephone,

172
00:08:13.758 --> 00:08:17.703
finally we can see far away with the television--

173
00:08:17.703 --> 00:08:18.408
<v Woman>Hubble.</v>

174
00:08:18.408 --> 00:08:20.088
<v ->And then we have space travel,</v>

175
00:08:20.088 --> 00:08:24.222
and what happens next is, by the end of this age,

176
00:08:24.222 --> 00:08:27.308
supposedly, according to this plan,

177
00:08:27.308 --> 00:08:29.644
we will reach the stars.

178
00:08:29.644 --> 00:08:32.267
So that's what's going to happen in this age,

179
00:08:32.267 --> 00:08:37.100
and then we progress to the next age, the silver age,

180
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.354
and in that age, we conquer time.

181
00:08:40.354 --> 00:08:42.445
So that's very hard for us to understand,

182
00:08:42.445 --> 00:08:46.391
but that's also the age, according to this whole way

183
00:08:46.391 --> 00:08:49.613
that the ancient Indian seers see it,

184
00:08:49.613 --> 00:08:52.354
is also the age of telepathy,

185
00:08:52.354 --> 00:08:56.373
the age of communicating directly with each other

186
00:08:56.373 --> 00:08:59.832
on a deeper level, where we go beyond mind.

187
00:08:59.832 --> 00:09:03.611
And that's really the age of wizards and sorcerers,

188
00:09:03.611 --> 00:09:05.021
as you could see it.

189
00:09:06.208 --> 00:09:09.666
And then from there, you go to the highest age,

190
00:09:09.666 --> 00:09:12.567
which is the Golden Age, where people

191
00:09:12.567 --> 00:09:14.520
have direct experience of God

192
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.592
and they understand vibration as the om,

193
00:09:17.592 --> 00:09:19.256
as it's called, in this case,

194
00:09:19.256 --> 00:09:23.234
but they understand the whole creation of God.

195
00:09:23.234 --> 00:09:27.106
And now, there's also levels beyond that,

196
00:09:27.106 --> 00:09:30.892
in terms of the yogic view, that reflects all of this,

197
00:09:30.892 --> 00:09:32.930
and I have no time to get into that.

198
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.593
But then when we go back to the understanding

199
00:09:36.593 --> 00:09:39.214
in the Silver Age,

200
00:09:39.214 --> 00:09:42.515
the depth of understanding between people,

201
00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:46.393
and the incredible mental powers,

202
00:09:46.393 --> 00:09:49.337
and as I said, people like wizards, you know.

203
00:09:49.337 --> 00:09:52.527
We go from there, the Egyptians retained

204
00:09:52.527 --> 00:09:54.660
much of that understanding.

205
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.784
<v Woman>Yes, and I'm going to just</v>

206
00:09:56.784 --> 00:09:58.899
inject one little thing here,

207
00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:00.865
and then just keep you on that same track,

208
00:10:00.865 --> 00:10:03.087
'cause we're getting now where we wanna start

209
00:10:03.087 --> 00:10:05.314
going into the meat of it, and that is,

210
00:10:05.314 --> 00:10:08.546
the interesting thing is, as we are as a people now,

211
00:10:08.546 --> 00:10:11.095
because our vision has become very physical,

212
00:10:11.095 --> 00:10:14.977
and very linear, we think of the Bronze Age, for example,

213
00:10:14.977 --> 00:10:18.412
most people will hear this and think, ah, the past,

214
00:10:18.412 --> 00:10:19.297
only the past.

215
00:10:19.297 --> 00:10:22.401
It's not well understood, certainly in Western tradition,

216
00:10:22.401 --> 00:10:25.633
this is a wheel or a circle, as you say.

217
00:10:25.633 --> 00:10:29.654
A cycle, cyclical nature of evolution

218
00:10:29.654 --> 00:10:31.414
and devolution, as it were.

219
00:10:31.414 --> 00:10:35.179
So the Bronze Age was, and the Bronze Age is again,

220
00:10:35.179 --> 00:10:37.664
and you're saying now, we are in that circular part

221
00:10:37.664 --> 00:10:40.355
of the wheel and the coming up of the Bronze Age,

222
00:10:40.355 --> 00:10:42.689
rather than the passing down through the Bronze Age.

223
00:10:42.689 --> 00:10:45.165
And my question in this is,

224
00:10:45.165 --> 00:10:49.494
and before we launch into these other

225
00:10:49.494 --> 00:10:52.267
modalities of being back then,

226
00:10:52.267 --> 00:10:56.577
when you're coming out of this materialistic or Iron Age,

227
00:10:56.577 --> 00:10:58.924
does there become a fear of immortality

228
00:10:58.924 --> 00:11:01.964
because you recognize nothing but the physical world?

229
00:11:01.964 --> 00:11:04.406
A fear or mortality, I should say.

230
00:11:04.406 --> 00:11:06.379
Because it seems that that's, we have a major crisis

231
00:11:06.379 --> 00:11:10.507
going on as a species, and our fear of our own mortality.

232
00:11:10.507 --> 00:11:12.491
And clinging to the physical world

233
00:11:12.491 --> 00:11:14.363
to validate that we are.

234
00:11:14.363 --> 00:11:17.068
We shop, therefore we are, you know?

235
00:11:17.068 --> 00:11:19.276
What's going on with that portion

236
00:11:19.276 --> 00:11:20.289
of where we are right now,

237
00:11:20.289 --> 00:11:21.985
and then we're gonna pop back.

238
00:11:21.985 --> 00:11:25.407
<v ->Yeah, well what happens right now is that,</v>

239
00:11:25.407 --> 00:11:27.467
since we are rising out of the Dark Age,

240
00:11:27.467 --> 00:11:31.963
which is the age of slavery to the senses,

241
00:11:31.963 --> 00:11:34.268
that's also why you have slavery ending,

242
00:11:34.268 --> 00:11:36.783
in terms of an institution.

243
00:11:36.783 --> 00:11:40.499
Like, in 1832 you have the American colonies

244
00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:43.830
and the English colonies stopping slavery,

245
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:48.830
you have the 23 million serfs freed in 1861,

246
00:11:49.183 --> 00:11:52.585
in Russia, and Lincoln freeing the slaves.

247
00:11:52.585 --> 00:11:56.436
And you know, then in 1910,

248
00:11:56.436 --> 00:11:59.945
China bans slavery.

249
00:11:59.945 --> 00:12:04.115
So there are different levels of understanding this,

250
00:12:04.115 --> 00:12:09.115
but we are going into this age of energy,

251
00:12:09.203 --> 00:12:11.637
that's another part of the Vedic keys,

252
00:12:11.637 --> 00:12:13.236
it's our time, the time to cover,

253
00:12:13.236 --> 00:12:16.809
but you go from sloth, from tamas,

254
00:12:16.809 --> 00:12:18.815
to rajas, which is energy.

255
00:12:18.815 --> 00:12:21.577
So you have this huge influx of energy coming in

256
00:12:21.577 --> 00:12:24.777
in our age, and the problem is,

257
00:12:24.777 --> 00:12:28.723
we're still holding onto these dogmatic,

258
00:12:28.723 --> 00:12:33.139
fundamentalist, simplistic ideas

259
00:12:33.139 --> 00:12:37.171
of the Dark Age, and we don't want to let go,

260
00:12:37.171 --> 00:12:38.920
but all this energy's coming in.

261
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.376
So it's like stirring up mud, and you can't see clearly

262
00:12:42.376 --> 00:12:45.906
because you're in this sense of mudness,

263
00:12:45.906 --> 00:12:49.159
and so people, like they drink coffee,

264
00:12:49.159 --> 00:12:50.823
when they can't feel the energy,

265
00:12:50.823 --> 00:12:54.919
they're trying to live in this energy world,

266
00:12:54.919 --> 00:12:56.444
that's just driving them crazy,

267
00:12:56.444 --> 00:12:59.324
because they can't adapt to this higher frequency,

268
00:12:59.324 --> 00:13:01.809
'cause we're still holding onto these other things.

269
00:13:01.809 --> 00:13:03.644
So people can get very violent,

270
00:13:03.644 --> 00:13:06.301
because they want things the way they used to be.

271
00:13:06.301 --> 00:13:09.180
Kinda quietly live on the way we were going.

272
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.806
You know, it's good enough for me,

273
00:13:11.806 --> 00:13:13.523
and I don't want anything new,

274
00:13:13.523 --> 00:13:15.528
and let me go, you know?

275
00:13:15.528 --> 00:13:19.816
And you can see a lot of that in fundamentalist Islam,

276
00:13:19.816 --> 00:13:22.216
unfortunately, whereas there are other,

277
00:13:22.216 --> 00:13:24.818
wonderful people in Islam as well, the Sufis.

278
00:13:24.818 --> 00:13:26.600
<v Woman>It's all forms of fundamentalism, really.</v>

279
00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.249
<v ->So it's happening all over the world--</v>

280
00:13:28.249 --> 00:13:28.889
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

281
00:13:28.889 --> 00:13:30.932
<v ->And so people feel this threat,</v>

282
00:13:30.932 --> 00:13:35.462
because their status quo is no longer acceptable.

283
00:13:35.462 --> 00:13:38.961
Just like Marxism is materialistic,

284
00:13:41.868 --> 00:13:43.318
atheism.

285
00:13:43.318 --> 00:13:46.877
And that kind of idea doesn't work anymore.

286
00:13:46.877 --> 00:13:50.034
Because people now are looking to interconnect

287
00:13:50.034 --> 00:13:52.426
with the universe, they're not just this

288
00:13:52.426 --> 00:13:55.986
little existentialist self that's completely on its own.

289
00:13:55.986 --> 00:13:59.239
We are now interconnecting, and that's the other thing,

290
00:13:59.239 --> 00:14:03.047
is 18 million people in the US alone today

291
00:14:03.047 --> 00:14:05.596
are practicing some form of yoga or meditation

292
00:14:05.596 --> 00:14:07.388
on a regular basis.

293
00:14:07.388 --> 00:14:11.612
When I started with yoga over 40 years ago,

294
00:14:11.612 --> 00:14:13.169
I was a loner.

295
00:14:13.169 --> 00:14:15.164
Hardly anyone understood that.

296
00:14:15.164 --> 00:14:18.321
In just 40 years, you can see the transformation,

297
00:14:18.321 --> 00:14:20.945
and in the higher ages, everyone meditates.

298
00:14:20.945 --> 00:14:25.595
Because we interconnect with nature,

299
00:14:25.595 --> 00:14:30.331
with our environment, on a deeper spiritual level.

300
00:14:30.331 --> 00:14:33.308
And therefore, it's no longer the good and evil

301
00:14:33.308 --> 00:14:37.771
kind of focus, it's really more a focus on,

302
00:14:39.665 --> 00:14:44.006
nature, and on our inner communion with God,

303
00:14:44.006 --> 00:14:46.417
and we want a personal experience of God,

304
00:14:46.417 --> 00:14:49.115
rather than just to be told to believe this, or that,

305
00:14:49.115 --> 00:14:51.345
in a dogmatic way.

306
00:14:51.345 --> 00:14:53.040
<v Woman>So that pretty much explains where we are</v>

307
00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.566
right now and what's pushing our buttons

308
00:14:54.566 --> 00:14:55.984
and why the fear.

309
00:14:55.984 --> 00:14:56.615
<v ->Right.</v>

310
00:14:56.615 --> 00:14:57.830
<v Woman>And so, let's go back now.</v>

311
00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.867
Before you were talking about the higher ages,

312
00:14:59.867 --> 00:15:02.864
the ages that we assign to the, the ages of wizards,

313
00:15:02.864 --> 00:15:03.846
for example.

314
00:15:03.846 --> 00:15:06.160
And let's go into Biblical texts that we know of

315
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.368
and some of those examples, and what you're saying

316
00:15:08.368 --> 00:15:10.395
was actually going on there.

317
00:15:10.395 --> 00:15:11.116
<v ->Right.</v>

318
00:15:12.155 --> 00:15:15.602
At that time, the best way to see some of that,

319
00:15:15.602 --> 00:15:18.012
is when you go to some of the Indian scriptures,

320
00:15:18.012 --> 00:15:20.636
and also go to the Old Testament.

321
00:15:20.636 --> 00:15:22.850
And in one case,

322
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:26.085
in the old Indian scriptures,

323
00:15:26.085 --> 00:15:29.422
they talk about people who had all these powers

324
00:15:29.422 --> 00:15:31.022
that are internalized.

325
00:15:31.022 --> 00:15:33.880
Like right now, we're developing technology,

326
00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.715
in the Bronze Age and eventually

327
00:15:35.715 --> 00:15:37.411
there's going to be an inner technology

328
00:15:37.411 --> 00:15:39.363
in the next Silver Age.

329
00:15:39.363 --> 00:15:41.826
And that kind of technology is the powers

330
00:15:41.826 --> 00:15:45.890
of the soul that we unleash from meditation.

331
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:49.303
And the same thing in the previous Silver Age,

332
00:15:49.303 --> 00:15:52.300
that ended around 3100 BC.

333
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.606
It lasted 3600 years, so it's somewhere

334
00:15:55.606 --> 00:16:00.339
around 7000 to 3100 BC.

335
00:16:00.339 --> 00:16:03.518
And in that Silver Age,

336
00:16:03.518 --> 00:16:08.157
people had tremendous mental powers,

337
00:16:08.157 --> 00:16:11.688
they had tremendous depth of understanding,

338
00:16:11.688 --> 00:16:14.903
and meditation, but there are always bad people

339
00:16:14.903 --> 00:16:16.819
in every age, you know, so there were different--

340
00:16:16.819 --> 00:16:17.726
<v Woman>And always brilliant,</v>

341
00:16:17.726 --> 00:16:18.750
wonderful people in every age.

342
00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:21.075
<v ->Right, yeah, and so, but more good people,</v>

343
00:16:21.075 --> 00:16:22.889
as you go higher.

344
00:16:22.889 --> 00:16:25.971
And so in this case,

345
00:16:25.971 --> 00:16:28.766
the Indian scriptures talk about,

346
00:16:28.766 --> 00:16:32.339
back in the Ramayana, ancient Hindu epic,

347
00:16:32.339 --> 00:16:36.126
talk about how the guru of Rama,

348
00:16:36.126 --> 00:16:38.872
the hero of the epic,

349
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:44.606
he gives them these four powers,

350
00:16:44.606 --> 00:16:47.273
to overcome his enemies.

351
00:16:47.273 --> 00:16:49.822
And what they are, he actually internalizes

352
00:16:49.822 --> 00:16:54.619
these type of potent entities into his inner being,

353
00:16:54.619 --> 00:16:57.434
and these become weapons to be used.

354
00:16:57.434 --> 00:17:00.773
And so these are, like you would think of wizards.

355
00:17:00.773 --> 00:17:02.906
<v Woman>Right, almost like psychic weaponry.</v>

356
00:17:02.906 --> 00:17:05.327
<v ->Right, they're very potent at something</v>

357
00:17:05.327 --> 00:17:07.855
we don't really understand at all.

358
00:17:07.855 --> 00:17:12.452
And, now when you come down into the last Bronze Age,

359
00:17:12.452 --> 00:17:15.113
and you look at Moses and Aaron,

360
00:17:15.113 --> 00:17:20.113
Moses was raised by Pharaoh like a stepson,

361
00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:23.695
and he was trained by the Egyptian priests

362
00:17:23.695 --> 00:17:26.361
in all this higher knowledge that they had kept

363
00:17:26.361 --> 00:17:28.009
from the Silver Age.

364
00:17:29.103 --> 00:17:30.703
So they were some of the last people

365
00:17:30.703 --> 00:17:33.540
that could still do this kind of magic,

366
00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.324
which seems strange to us now.

367
00:17:36.324 --> 00:17:39.300
Of course, anyone right now, if we showed people

368
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.169
our cell phones and that we can talk anywhere,

369
00:17:42.169 --> 00:17:43.641
to people around the world,

370
00:17:43.641 --> 00:17:47.705
so 100, 200 years ago, it'd be magic to them.

371
00:17:47.705 --> 00:17:48.494
So anyway--

372
00:17:48.494 --> 00:17:49.881
<v Woman>But to part the sea, for example.</v>

373
00:17:49.881 --> 00:17:52.213
<v ->Right, and so,</v>

374
00:17:52.213 --> 00:17:55.339
when Moses met with Pharaoh

375
00:17:55.339 --> 00:17:57.226
to let the Israelites go,

376
00:17:57.226 --> 00:17:59.963
and Pharaoh didn't want that to happen,

377
00:18:01.514 --> 00:18:03.990
Moses had to struggle with the priests there,

378
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:06.635
with the Egyptian priests, and one of the things a staff,

379
00:18:06.635 --> 00:18:08.000
like we know about magic wands,

380
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.349
well his staff, he threw it down and it turned into a snake.

381
00:18:11.349 --> 00:18:13.834
And then the Egyptian priests turned their staffs

382
00:18:13.834 --> 00:18:15.530
into snakes, and they battled,

383
00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:18.656
and of course Moses being a realized soul,

384
00:18:18.656 --> 00:18:20.822
won that encounter.

385
00:18:20.822 --> 00:18:23.147
And then some of the other things

386
00:18:23.147 --> 00:18:26.603
where he used his wand to turn the Nile River

387
00:18:26.603 --> 00:18:29.259
into blood, these are all things that,

388
00:18:29.259 --> 00:18:31.093
they actually had those kind of powers

389
00:18:31.093 --> 00:18:33.365
in those days, and we tend to think,

390
00:18:33.365 --> 00:18:34.475
oh this is just maybe stories--

391
00:18:34.475 --> 00:18:36.044
<v Woman>These are just metaphors or so, yes.</v>

392
00:18:36.044 --> 00:18:39.457
<v ->But we forget that things were different</v>

393
00:18:39.457 --> 00:18:42.592
in different time zones, and we begin to see

394
00:18:42.592 --> 00:18:44.608
that happening right now, when we see

395
00:18:44.608 --> 00:18:46.603
the incredible advance of technology

396
00:18:46.603 --> 00:18:48.811
in the last hundred years.

397
00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:51.926
So, again what people thought,

398
00:18:51.926 --> 00:18:54.592
that we think is normal, is like magic to people

399
00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:56.171
a couple hundred years ago,

400
00:18:56.171 --> 00:18:59.285
and what's it going to be like very soon?

401
00:18:59.285 --> 00:19:01.099
<v Woman>How do you see this,</v>

402
00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:05.280
in terms of the very personal human element of it?

403
00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.157
In every age you have the brilliant ones,

404
00:19:07.157 --> 00:19:09.013
in every age you have those who are,

405
00:19:09.013 --> 00:19:12.874
perhaps have lower intentions rather than higher intentions.

406
00:19:12.874 --> 00:19:15.562
And where we sit now, it almost seems as though,

407
00:19:15.562 --> 00:19:17.887
we're sitting on the verge of understanding things

408
00:19:17.887 --> 00:19:20.532
that may not have normally been available,

409
00:19:20.532 --> 00:19:22.879
except in Silver or Golden ages,

410
00:19:22.879 --> 00:19:26.485
but many people seem to be going beyond our age,

411
00:19:26.485 --> 00:19:29.332
and beyond, and cross lines of consciousness.

412
00:19:29.332 --> 00:19:31.476
How do you see this whole phenomena,

413
00:19:31.476 --> 00:19:34.356
of our human expansion, right now?

414
00:19:34.356 --> 00:19:35.188
<v ->That's really--</v>

415
00:19:35.188 --> 00:19:36.159
<v Woman>Even though we're in a lower part of--</v>

416
00:19:36.159 --> 00:19:36.949
<v ->The perfect question, because--</v>

417
00:19:36.949 --> 00:19:38.026
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

418
00:19:38.026 --> 00:19:40.970
<v ->What's happening is that in every age,</v>

419
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:45.940
there come people, spiritual guides,

420
00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.526
that in a sense God sends to us,

421
00:19:49.526 --> 00:19:52.738
that will bring us to the next age,

422
00:19:52.738 --> 00:19:55.148
so that now that we are in the Bronze Age,

423
00:19:55.148 --> 00:19:57.196
the religion for this age,

424
00:19:57.196 --> 00:20:01.004
has to be to bring us to the Silver Age.

425
00:20:01.004 --> 00:20:03.815
And so we are being given those type of,

426
00:20:06.904 --> 00:20:10.423
messages, for instance,

427
00:20:10.423 --> 00:20:12.664
what this conference was about,

428
00:20:12.664 --> 00:20:14.293
on ancient knowledge,

429
00:20:14.293 --> 00:20:17.868
and especially on the Yugas,

430
00:20:17.868 --> 00:20:20.737
all comes from Swami Yukteswar,

431
00:20:20.737 --> 00:20:23.926
who first really clarified and talked about it,

432
00:20:23.926 --> 00:20:27.113
and he was the guru of Paramahansa Yogananda,

433
00:20:27.113 --> 00:20:29.785
who wrote Autobiography of a Yogi.

434
00:20:29.785 --> 00:20:34.785
And now, he knew what was going on

435
00:20:34.894 --> 00:20:37.636
in terms of the ages, and that's one of the reasons why

436
00:20:37.636 --> 00:20:39.865
he sent Paramahansa Yogananda to the west

437
00:20:39.865 --> 00:20:42.703
and to the world, to bring again the science

438
00:20:42.703 --> 00:20:45.561
of Kriya Yoga, which was a method or a technique

439
00:20:45.561 --> 00:20:47.716
that was used in the higher ages.

440
00:20:47.716 --> 00:20:50.180
I found it in some of the old Taoist texts,

441
00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:52.347
I found it in Tibetan Buddhism.

442
00:20:52.347 --> 00:20:54.182
<v Woman>What's the hallmark of that practice?</v>

443
00:20:54.182 --> 00:20:56.599
<v ->That technique really has to do with</v>

444
00:20:56.599 --> 00:21:00.870
circulating the light, in the spine and brain,

445
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:03.408
to open up the channel to God,

446
00:21:03.408 --> 00:21:06.391
so you can have a direct experience of God.

447
00:21:06.391 --> 00:21:10.870
And when that, the reason that technique is being taught,

448
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.217
is to bring us to the next age.

449
00:21:13.217 --> 00:21:18.166
He also gave the energization exercises,

450
00:21:18.166 --> 00:21:21.899
which, in a way is like recharging a battery,

451
00:21:21.899 --> 00:21:26.059
and it acclimatizes us to the energy of this age.

452
00:21:26.059 --> 00:21:27.798
So he gave us something for this age,

453
00:21:27.798 --> 00:21:30.097
with the energization exercises.

454
00:21:30.097 --> 00:21:32.857
They're a form of, almost like Tai Chi,

455
00:21:32.857 --> 00:21:37.586
and they last about 15 minutes, you do them twice a day.

456
00:21:37.586 --> 00:21:40.903
But they bring your whole body into attunement,

457
00:21:40.903 --> 00:21:42.876
through tension relaxation,

458
00:21:42.876 --> 00:21:46.289
and working with the prana, with the energy.

459
00:21:46.289 --> 00:21:49.031
And that's the thing, as I mentioned before,

460
00:21:49.031 --> 00:21:51.121
people are going crazy with this energy

461
00:21:51.121 --> 00:21:54.225
that's come into the world, how do you handle it?

462
00:21:54.225 --> 00:21:56.156
And this is one way you do that.

463
00:21:56.156 --> 00:21:56.915
<v Woman>And what is the name</v>

464
00:21:56.915 --> 00:21:58.403
of that particular practice?

465
00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:02.709
<v ->That would be the recharging exercises,</v>

466
00:22:02.709 --> 00:22:03.859
or energizing exercises.

467
00:22:03.859 --> 00:22:05.008
<v Woman>Ok.</v>

468
00:22:05.927 --> 00:22:09.549
<v ->And that's all part of self-realization fellowship,</v>

469
00:22:09.549 --> 00:22:11.757
they have the lessons that take you

470
00:22:11.757 --> 00:22:14.749
three and a half years through all these different things.

471
00:22:14.749 --> 00:22:17.697
And there are many paths that all take you

472
00:22:17.697 --> 00:22:19.212
to this next level.

473
00:22:19.212 --> 00:22:21.441
And the beauty of it is now that we've gone

474
00:22:21.441 --> 00:22:25.782
from the Dark Age of dogma and literal interpretation

475
00:22:25.782 --> 00:22:28.310
of scriptures, we're to the point where

476
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:30.752
people are no longer happy with being told

477
00:22:30.752 --> 00:22:34.422
what to believe, they want the personal experience of God.

478
00:22:34.422 --> 00:22:37.441
And so, now everyone is looking

479
00:22:37.441 --> 00:22:39.254
to practice these kind of things,

480
00:22:39.254 --> 00:22:41.995
to take them to the next level.

481
00:22:41.995 --> 00:22:43.478
<v Woman>And technology, even,</v>

482
00:22:43.478 --> 00:22:46.838
is being developed to be able to incorporate

483
00:22:48.115 --> 00:22:52.507
a connection between our minds, and light,

484
00:22:52.507 --> 00:22:55.952
and color, and sound, and helping bring about

485
00:22:55.952 --> 00:22:58.736
the remembrance of those vibratory frequencies,

486
00:22:58.736 --> 00:23:01.776
and the path to enlightenment.

487
00:23:01.776 --> 00:23:04.720
So we have hard core people in the world

488
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.280
of engineering and physics that are even grounding this

489
00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.669
into literal physical technologies,

490
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:12.847
as well as, you say, practices being remembered again.

491
00:23:12.847 --> 00:23:15.151
How do you see this playing itself out,

492
00:23:15.151 --> 00:23:18.543
for those who are, well,

493
00:23:18.543 --> 00:23:20.260
let's talk about those who are on the leading edge,

494
00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.607
who are already now starting to usher

495
00:23:22.607 --> 00:23:24.996
our way into the Silver Age.

496
00:23:24.996 --> 00:23:26.000
Just what you were saying.

497
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.920
<v ->Well, a lot of it begins with physics,</v>

498
00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.477
going into quantum physics,

499
00:23:29.477 --> 00:23:33.435
going to the holographic kind of approach.

500
00:23:33.435 --> 00:23:35.099
And then medicine had to follow,

501
00:23:35.099 --> 00:23:38.448
so now you have energy and medicine starting up,

502
00:23:38.448 --> 00:23:40.795
and now for the first time also,

503
00:23:40.795 --> 00:23:44.581
you have people recognizing acupuncture again,

504
00:23:44.581 --> 00:23:47.599
which is energy medicine from the higher ages,

505
00:23:47.599 --> 00:23:49.423
that was preserved.

506
00:23:49.423 --> 00:23:53.028
And also Tai Chi, people weren't practicing Tai Chi

507
00:23:53.028 --> 00:23:55.652
except in China, but now you see them practicing

508
00:23:55.652 --> 00:23:57.274
in parks all over.

509
00:23:57.274 --> 00:23:59.524
So, this sort of approach is coming,

510
00:23:59.524 --> 00:24:02.713
but what we see more and more, in terms of science,

511
00:24:02.713 --> 00:24:07.396
is the interplay of pranic energies, or chi,

512
00:24:07.396 --> 00:24:12.396
with electricity, magnetism, the forces of creation.

513
00:24:13.582 --> 00:24:15.758
And so we come to a deeper understanding,

514
00:24:15.758 --> 00:24:19.662
and we also begin to be able to do things

515
00:24:19.662 --> 00:24:23.171
that gradually advance us, and that also enhance things.

516
00:24:23.171 --> 00:24:27.279
Like I would think that the staff, or magic wand

517
00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:29.647
of a magician in the Silver Age, you know,

518
00:24:29.647 --> 00:24:33.903
probably has some sort of science behind it,

519
00:24:33.903 --> 00:24:36.268
of focusing the energy through that wand.

520
00:24:36.268 --> 00:24:37.177
<v Woman>So it's said, yes.</v>

521
00:24:37.177 --> 00:24:38.399
<v ->Those sort of things, but of course,</v>

522
00:24:38.399 --> 00:24:41.461
on a deeper level the wand represents the spine,

523
00:24:41.461 --> 00:24:44.458
and the chakras, and the spine and all the powers there.

524
00:24:44.458 --> 00:24:47.851
So depending on what level is the intention

525
00:24:47.851 --> 00:24:50.466
of what you're reading in the scriptures.

526
00:24:50.466 --> 00:24:52.351
But as we go on,

527
00:24:52.351 --> 00:24:55.818
we get from the Bronze to the Silver Age,

528
00:24:55.818 --> 00:24:59.785
which is like, we've got 2000 years to go in the Bronze Age.

529
00:24:59.785 --> 00:25:04.148
And at that point, more and more we get

530
00:25:04.148 --> 00:25:06.829
to the energy control,

531
00:25:06.829 --> 00:25:11.302
as opposed to technology.

532
00:25:11.302 --> 00:25:14.907
Technology will begin to become less and less,

533
00:25:14.907 --> 00:25:16.528
and mental control,

534
00:25:16.528 --> 00:25:20.672
the control of the powers of the soul will come out,

535
00:25:20.672 --> 00:25:24.320
and then be more primary in the Silver Age,

536
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.080
but there'll be a combination.

537
00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.331
And gradually when you get to the Golden Age,

538
00:25:28.331 --> 00:25:32.416
people have everything they need from the power of the soul,

539
00:25:32.416 --> 00:25:35.178
so they can live very simply, live in nature.

540
00:25:35.178 --> 00:25:37.621
If you have everything, if you don't need clothes,

541
00:25:37.621 --> 00:25:40.682
if you don't, if you have complete control,

542
00:25:40.682 --> 00:25:43.701
all this technology becomes unnecessary.

543
00:25:43.701 --> 00:25:45.514
And so sometimes, you know, we judge people,

544
00:25:45.514 --> 00:25:48.628
oh, they're primitive, 'cause they don't have technology.

545
00:25:48.628 --> 00:25:51.732
Well, if they have this deeper state,

546
00:25:51.732 --> 00:25:53.801
then they're way beyond technology.

547
00:25:53.801 --> 00:25:55.220
But there's a difference.

548
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.638
You know, a big difference.

549
00:25:56.638 --> 00:26:00.545
You can think of just a primitive person living,

550
00:26:00.545 --> 00:26:05.269
a hunting gathering culture, but actually those people,

551
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:07.402
they have their shamans and things

552
00:26:07.402 --> 00:26:10.026
who are very advanced themselves.

553
00:26:10.026 --> 00:26:12.636
So it's hard to make judgements.

554
00:26:13.852 --> 00:26:17.996
But the point is, once you have gone through these stages

555
00:26:17.996 --> 00:26:20.364
and reached that highest stage,

556
00:26:20.364 --> 00:26:24.662
then people actually are able to live in complete harmony

557
00:26:24.662 --> 00:26:27.009
with everything around them.

558
00:26:27.009 --> 00:26:28.214
<v Woman>And that's what we're striving,</v>

559
00:26:28.214 --> 00:26:29.805
even if we don't know it, that is what we're

560
00:26:29.805 --> 00:26:33.261
internally seeking, that's why we've become restless,

561
00:26:33.261 --> 00:26:36.300
and we've become distrustful

562
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.996
of all the systems, the religions,

563
00:26:37.996 --> 00:26:39.852
the politicians, and so forth.

564
00:26:39.852 --> 00:26:42.124
This is a very natural type of backlash

565
00:26:42.124 --> 00:26:45.986
in order to force our birth into the new way.

566
00:26:45.986 --> 00:26:47.759
And it's interesting what you just talked about,

567
00:26:47.759 --> 00:26:49.497
because oftentimes when people are saying,

568
00:26:49.497 --> 00:26:51.129
well if there were such advanced civilizations,

569
00:26:51.129 --> 00:26:52.708
why don't we find those artifacts?

570
00:26:52.708 --> 00:26:55.268
But as you say, in the most advanced civilizations,

571
00:26:55.268 --> 00:26:59.278
the artifacts are less necessary.

572
00:26:59.278 --> 00:27:01.486
<v ->Yeah we're in a transition now,</v>

573
00:27:01.486 --> 00:27:03.971
because it's only during this shorter transition

574
00:27:03.971 --> 00:27:07.203
of a few hundred years of the Industrial Revolution,

575
00:27:07.203 --> 00:27:09.801
that you have all this waste.

576
00:27:09.801 --> 00:27:11.102
<v Woman>Yes, that's the problem.</v>

577
00:27:11.102 --> 00:27:12.656
<v ->Now to give you an idea of what's happening,</v>

578
00:27:12.656 --> 00:27:15.116
one of my friends, 'cause I'm active

579
00:27:15.116 --> 00:27:17.136
in the field of nanotechnology,

580
00:27:17.136 --> 00:27:18.919
and one of the pioneers,

581
00:27:20.204 --> 00:27:23.308
formerly a professor at Rutgers University, Josh Hall,

582
00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:25.399
wrote the book Nanofutures.

583
00:27:25.399 --> 00:27:29.344
And he told me about his idea

584
00:27:29.344 --> 00:27:33.688
of what's coming next, and we call them foglets.

585
00:27:33.688 --> 00:27:37.379
And this idea is if you imagine a television screen,

586
00:27:37.379 --> 00:27:40.120
you see the pixels, they're so fine, they're so small,

587
00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.528
that you get a perfect picture,

588
00:27:41.528 --> 00:27:43.107
you don't know there are pixels.

589
00:27:43.107 --> 00:27:46.413
Now imagine these pixels being even 1/10,

590
00:27:46.413 --> 00:27:49.671
or 1/100 of that size, so that it's really perfect,

591
00:27:49.671 --> 00:27:52.199
but they're not two-dimensional pixels,

592
00:27:52.199 --> 00:27:55.270
they're voxels, they're three-dimensional.

593
00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:57.212
And we're going to call them foglets.

594
00:27:57.212 --> 00:28:00.508
And these little foglets have eight little arms

595
00:28:00.508 --> 00:28:02.824
that come out of them that hook together

596
00:28:02.824 --> 00:28:04.410
with other foglets.

597
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:08.054
And they are pre-programmed for different strength,

598
00:28:08.054 --> 00:28:11.798
so if they're on your floor, in the future,

599
00:28:11.798 --> 00:28:13.995
in 50, 100 years from now,

600
00:28:13.995 --> 00:28:17.742
that's going to be one of the technologies we're seeing.

601
00:28:17.742 --> 00:28:19.030
Now when they're on your floor,

602
00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:21.814
they can have the consistency of a soft carpet,

603
00:28:21.814 --> 00:28:24.353
or they have can have a consistency of a hardwood floor.

604
00:28:24.353 --> 00:28:26.784
Or anything, it could be like a metal floor,

605
00:28:26.784 --> 00:28:29.430
depending on what you program it to be.

606
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:34.101
But now, let's say in your house, you wake up,

607
00:28:34.101 --> 00:28:36.373
now your bed is made of foglets.

608
00:28:36.373 --> 00:28:38.997
So you say, oh, ok, it's daytime,

609
00:28:38.997 --> 00:28:41.386
I want my room to be my living room now.

610
00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:44.385
So all of a sudden the foglets in your bed dissolve,

611
00:28:44.385 --> 00:28:47.745
and re-form as a couch, chair, table,

612
00:28:47.745 --> 00:28:49.761
whatever you want and you have programmed

613
00:28:49.761 --> 00:28:51.041
for your living room.

614
00:28:51.041 --> 00:28:52.108
<v Woman>And what is the mechanism</v>

615
00:28:52.108 --> 00:28:53.643
for the programming?

616
00:28:53.643 --> 00:28:57.121
<v ->The program, I mean software,</v>

617
00:28:57.121 --> 00:29:00.450
that runs it, and that all the foglets,

618
00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:04.802
they have tiny, brain in there that corresponds.

619
00:29:05.799 --> 00:29:07.208
They only have to follow the program,

620
00:29:07.208 --> 00:29:09.086
they don't have to contain the program themselves.

621
00:29:09.086 --> 00:29:10.058
<v Woman>Whereas in the Golden Age,</v>

622
00:29:10.058 --> 00:29:11.413
it would be pure intention.

623
00:29:11.413 --> 00:29:12.576
<v ->Right, it would be pure intention.</v>

624
00:29:12.576 --> 00:29:13.248
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

625
00:29:13.248 --> 00:29:15.968
<v ->But now, when these things form like that,</v>

626
00:29:15.968 --> 00:29:19.861
let's say a friend of yours calls you, from Brazil.

627
00:29:19.861 --> 00:29:23.861
And immediately, if you want to pretend

628
00:29:23.861 --> 00:29:27.370
that you're in his place, then automatically,

629
00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:31.392
your whole room will re-form, all the foglets will re-form,

630
00:29:31.392 --> 00:29:34.800
to his furniture in his room, and look like his room.

631
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.605
And he will form out of foglets,

632
00:29:37.605 --> 00:29:39.354
and so you can go up, shake his hand,

633
00:29:39.354 --> 00:29:42.341
his hand will be soft like a real hand,

634
00:29:42.341 --> 00:29:45.647
and you can talk to him, you can sit down on his couch,

635
00:29:45.647 --> 00:29:48.826
even though you're still in your living room.

636
00:29:48.826 --> 00:29:52.537
But the amazing thing is, this isn't virtual reality,

637
00:29:52.537 --> 00:29:55.140
because it's not, you're not some kind of headset

638
00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.725
that's pretending in a virtual world,

639
00:29:58.725 --> 00:30:00.090
this is in the real world.

640
00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:01.999
You're actually sitting on this couch,

641
00:30:01.999 --> 00:30:05.253
which is conforming to your friend's couch in Brazil.

642
00:30:05.253 --> 00:30:08.293
<v Woman>So it's like a holographic reality</v>

643
00:30:08.293 --> 00:30:09.456
but with density to it.

644
00:30:09.456 --> 00:30:10.362
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>

645
00:30:10.362 --> 00:30:11.376
<v Woman>And you're saying this is--</v>

646
00:30:11.376 --> 00:30:13.233
<v ->So even the person feels real to you.</v>

647
00:30:13.233 --> 00:30:16.113
And so you wonder what's real, what's not real.

648
00:30:16.113 --> 00:30:20.646
But now my real point is, once you're done with this,

649
00:30:20.646 --> 00:30:22.480
everything can dissolve back down,

650
00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.006
and your house can dissolve.

651
00:30:24.006 --> 00:30:26.651
You go on vacation, you can dissolve your house,

652
00:30:26.651 --> 00:30:29.200
say, and have a nice little park there.

653
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.579
And when you come back, you pick a program

654
00:30:31.579 --> 00:30:34.155
of what house you want, and it re-forms.

655
00:30:34.155 --> 00:30:35.926
<v Woman>How far down the pipe do you see this being,</v>

656
00:30:35.926 --> 00:30:38.628
this technology being utilized?

657
00:30:39.633 --> 00:30:40.663
How far along are you?

658
00:30:40.663 --> 00:30:41.847
<v ->We're going to see some of this</v>

659
00:30:41.847 --> 00:30:45.513
in the next 20, 30 years, small versions of it,

660
00:30:45.513 --> 00:30:47.604
and gradually, like what you'll see is like,

661
00:30:47.604 --> 00:30:49.438
when you're walking through your house,

662
00:30:49.438 --> 00:30:52.713
your television screen will follow you along the walls,

663
00:30:52.713 --> 00:30:57.235
as pixels or holograms or foglets,

664
00:30:57.235 --> 00:31:02.184
and it keeps going, more complex.

665
00:31:02.184 --> 00:31:04.040
Like the other thing that's going to happen,

666
00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.173
is you're going to have the nanosuit,

667
00:31:06.173 --> 00:31:10.034
the nanotechnology suit, which is only like a micron thick,

668
00:31:10.034 --> 00:31:12.402
and so it's so thin that you don't even know

669
00:31:12.402 --> 00:31:15.111
you're wearing it, it's completely invisible to you,

670
00:31:15.111 --> 00:31:16.466
but it has all this machinery,

671
00:31:16.466 --> 00:31:18.940
that completely controls the temperature.

672
00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:22.386
So you can be in the Arctic, walking, what seems like naked,

673
00:31:22.386 --> 00:31:23.751
and never feel the cold.

674
00:31:23.751 --> 00:31:26.588
You can be in the Sahara desert, won't bother you.

675
00:31:26.588 --> 00:31:29.553
Then you'll have the equivalent of conversion

676
00:31:29.553 --> 00:31:32.060
of water into oxygen, for you,

677
00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:34.801
so you can just walk into the ocean, under the ocean,

678
00:31:34.801 --> 00:31:37.201
and you don't need a suit.

679
00:31:37.201 --> 00:31:40.049
And all this kind of thing is on its way,

680
00:31:40.049 --> 00:31:43.302
we know some of the basic technology.

681
00:31:43.302 --> 00:31:46.203
So what happens in the higher ages?

682
00:31:46.203 --> 00:31:48.251
There won't be any waste.

683
00:31:48.251 --> 00:31:50.779
Everything just, when it's used, will reform

684
00:31:50.779 --> 00:31:52.848
into whatever else you want.

685
00:31:52.848 --> 00:31:56.655
So in that sense we're lucky we have the Pyramids left to us

686
00:31:56.655 --> 00:31:59.258
as something we can see from higher ages.

687
00:31:59.258 --> 00:32:01.903
And of course these people were aware of the lower ages,

688
00:32:01.903 --> 00:32:03.759
so they left us things.

689
00:32:03.759 --> 00:32:07.428
But primarily are things that we can't hurt ourselves with.

690
00:32:07.428 --> 00:32:08.453
<v Woman>Right, exactly.</v>

691
00:32:08.453 --> 00:32:09.061
<v ->Yeah.</v>

692
00:32:09.061 --> 00:32:09.947
<v Woman>And final thoughts on this?</v>

693
00:32:09.947 --> 00:32:12.080
This is absolutely fascinating, and it makes

694
00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:15.238
the notion of our evolution not frightening at all,

695
00:32:15.238 --> 00:32:17.765
but very inviting.

696
00:32:17.765 --> 00:32:18.512
<v ->That's true.</v>

697
00:32:18.512 --> 00:32:19.260
<v Woman>Because I think a lot of people are,</v>

698
00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.233
obviously a lot of people are frightened right now,

699
00:32:21.233 --> 00:32:23.644
and need a hand extended out,

700
00:32:23.644 --> 00:32:25.873
to move in the next direction.

701
00:32:25.873 --> 00:32:26.577
<v ->Yeah.</v>

702
00:32:26.577 --> 00:32:29.340
Well, what's happening, too, is right now is we're,

703
00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:33.403
even though we've entered the Bronze Age in this cycle,

704
00:32:33.403 --> 00:32:36.798
and things are going to look a lot better,

705
00:32:36.798 --> 00:32:38.456
one of the problems is that,

706
00:32:39.844 --> 00:32:42.099
there's, as I said, cycles within cycles,

707
00:32:42.099 --> 00:32:43.934
so if you look at a mini cycle,

708
00:32:43.934 --> 00:32:46.163
a subcycle of this Bronze Age,

709
00:32:46.163 --> 00:32:51.163
we're in the Dark Age portion, which is only 100 years.

710
00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:54.248
But we still have this century,

711
00:32:54.248 --> 00:32:58.423
to kind of get out of all this problem that we're seeing,

712
00:32:58.423 --> 00:33:02.120
all this mixed up mud, that's churning with all this energy.

713
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.928
So, even though we may feel like things are terrible

714
00:33:05.928 --> 00:33:09.458
right now, when you look at the overall picture

715
00:33:09.458 --> 00:33:11.154
and you understand, look at,

716
00:33:11.154 --> 00:33:13.127
just what's happened with technology,

717
00:33:13.127 --> 00:33:15.218
the depth, understanding of man,

718
00:33:15.218 --> 00:33:18.354
how it has changed to be able to comprehend

719
00:33:18.354 --> 00:33:20.935
quantum mechanics and all these kind of things

720
00:33:20.935 --> 00:33:23.537
in the last 100 years.

721
00:33:23.537 --> 00:33:25.713
That this is going to keep going,

722
00:33:25.713 --> 00:33:27.409
this is not going to change.

723
00:33:27.409 --> 00:33:29.500
The time wasn't right before though,

724
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:32.540
because people tried doing things like printing presses,

725
00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:37.275
in China and even in Europe in the 12th century,

726
00:33:37.275 --> 00:33:40.551
but it wasn't time yet, the transition period hadn't come.

727
00:33:40.551 --> 00:33:43.942
So everything has its proper time.

728
00:33:43.942 --> 00:33:46.449
And so, we are going to see changes,

729
00:33:46.449 --> 00:33:49.585
and I know with 2012, people are worried,

730
00:33:49.585 --> 00:33:52.187
and again there, I mean that's an alignment

731
00:33:52.187 --> 00:33:54.321
with the center of the galaxy,

732
00:33:54.321 --> 00:33:57.179
and I don't know what kind of implications it has,

733
00:33:57.179 --> 00:34:01.361
but we are going to see changes,

734
00:34:01.361 --> 00:34:04.929
and things have to work themselves out,

735
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.626
but we're going to be out of that.

736
00:34:08.626 --> 00:34:10.524
It's safe to say it, for me right now,

737
00:34:10.524 --> 00:34:13.415
within the end of this century, 'cause I won't be around.

738
00:34:13.415 --> 00:34:14.460
(laughter)

739
00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.955
But, anyway, that's sort of how things are looking.

740
00:34:15.955 --> 00:34:17.626
<v Woman>That's still good news.</v>

741
00:34:17.626 --> 00:34:18.526
Good news for humanity.

742
00:34:18.526 --> 00:34:20.275
<v ->Things are definitely positive for the future,</v>

743
00:34:20.275 --> 00:34:24.539
but we may have some hiccups in the immediate future.

744
00:34:25.476 --> 00:34:26.657
<v Woman>Very true.</v>

745
00:34:26.657 --> 00:34:27.958
Thank you so much for your time,

746
00:34:27.958 --> 00:34:29.793
and I'm glad, because we met last year,

747
00:34:29.793 --> 00:34:32.119
and I'm so glad we finally got to catch you this year.

748
00:34:32.119 --> 00:34:33.698
<v ->I know, yeah, it's wonderful.</v>

749
00:34:33.698 --> 00:34:34.595
<v Woman>It's a pleasure, thank you Boris.</v>

750
00:34:34.595 --> 00:34:35.433
<v ->Thank you.</v>

751
00:34:36.811 --> 00:34:38.928
<v ->For those of you interested in these great cycles</v>

752
00:34:38.928 --> 00:34:41.925
of consciousness, you will likely also enjoy our interviews

753
00:34:41.925 --> 00:34:44.431
with John Major Jenkins, Walter Cruttenden,

754
00:34:44.431 --> 00:34:46.053
and John Anthony West.

755
00:34:46.053 --> 00:34:48.671
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
