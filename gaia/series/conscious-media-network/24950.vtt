00:00:00.768 --> 00:00:03.788
<v ->How many times have you wondered or even researched</v>

2
00:00:03.788 --> 00:00:06.526
into whether or not you've had past lives?

3
00:00:06.526 --> 00:00:09.106
Paul Von Ward is taking the subject head on with

4
00:00:09.106 --> 00:00:11.366
his newest book "The Soul Genome",

5
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.766
science looks at reincarnation.

6
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.786
As a former theologian and psychologist,

7
00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:18.266
Paul found that the most essential issues surrounding

8
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:21.246
mankind were not being answered by these models.

9
00:00:21.246 --> 00:00:23.826
He finally asked the big question.

10
00:00:23.826 --> 00:00:26.306
How would we live our lives if we knew that we are

11
00:00:26.306 --> 00:00:28.546
the ones who will inherit the Earth, as our own

12
00:00:28.546 --> 00:00:31.827
grandchildren, great grandchildren and so forth?

13
00:00:31.827 --> 00:00:34.636 line:15% 
(music)

14
00:00:41.482 --> 00:00:45.002
<v Woman>I find it interesting that while many cultures</v>

15
00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:49.742
throughout history have held in regard, and have really,

16
00:00:49.742 --> 00:00:51.702
it's woven into the framework of their understanding

17
00:00:51.702 --> 00:00:53.822
of life, the notion of reincarnation.

18
00:00:53.822 --> 00:00:56.122
The western world, which is causing the greatest

19
00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:59.500
amount of damage at this point in time, on the planet

20
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.880
itself, is the part of the world that's least likely to

21
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.620
buy into this notion that would create a

22
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.160
sense of greater personal responsibility.

23
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
It's interesting conundrum we have here and

24
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.460
thank God you're doing the kind of work you're doing.

25
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.980
Let's start out with how you ended up with your education

26
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.640
and background in the area of looking for the scientific

27
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.460
case for reincarnation.

28
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.460
<v ->Well, I think my growth and development in this direction</v>

29
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.840
is a response to the question you asked

30
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.700
because I, in my research for other books and so

31
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.276
and I've always taken sort of an academic, historical,

32
00:01:42.276 --> 00:01:45.396
philosophical perspective, you know, to the subject

33
00:01:45.396 --> 00:01:49.394
and waxed philosophically and wisely on these issues.

34
00:01:49.394 --> 00:01:53.994
And I got started in this research on reincarnation for

35
00:01:53.994 --> 00:01:57.154
the book in the same way.

36
00:01:57.154 --> 00:01:59.094
I talked to the publisher about it and we were going

37
00:01:59.094 --> 00:02:01.274
to look at the history of things, and belief systems,

38
00:02:01.274 --> 00:02:03.834
and philosophy and all of that sort of thing.

39
00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:06.514
And I started, and then I thought, well now wait a minute.

40
00:02:06.514 --> 00:02:10.174
As I got halfway through the writing of the first draft,

41
00:02:10.174 --> 00:02:13.154
I thought, I'm saying the same things

42
00:02:13.154 --> 00:02:15.812
that other people have said.

43
00:02:15.812 --> 00:02:18.711
It's been written in many languages.

44
00:02:18.711 --> 00:02:20.551
It hasn't had an impact on the world that

45
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:22.991
we can see as constructive.

46
00:02:22.991 --> 00:02:26.331
And I'm involved now in researching this book.

47
00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:29.331
I'm meeting mystical groups.

48
00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:33.831
I'm meeting psychical groups, therapists who are

49
00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:36.811
talking about reincarnation from their perspective.

50
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:40.371
And it seems to have a little bit of impact on the

51
00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:43.871
individual at a moment of discussion or recognition

52
00:02:43.871 --> 00:02:46.631
of a possible past lifetime, but then they go about

53
00:02:46.631 --> 00:02:48.851
their lives the same way.

54
00:02:48.851 --> 00:02:53.851
So, my question is, if this is real, if reincatnation

55
00:02:54.311 --> 00:02:59.311
is a real part of the cosmology of this universe,

56
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:01.792
it ought to be something more substantive.

57
00:03:01.792 --> 00:03:06.491
It ought to be something that's more rooted in who

58
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:10.151
we really are and influences who we really are.

59
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:13.751
And if that's the case, we ought to be able to prove it

60
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:15.211
to other people.

61
00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:17.931
Not that I just had a mystical experience and I know I'm

62
00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:22.031
the reincarnation of Mr. X two centuries ago

63
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:24.989
or my spirit guide said to me that I'm the reincatnation

64
00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.509
of so-and-so and I feel so good about it.

65
00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:29.909
But I don't change what I'm doing.

66
00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.869
So I said, let's try to look at this question, and I

67
00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:38.209
switched the whole approach to the research for the book.

68
00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.209
Let's look at cases that only have imperical evidence.

69
00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:48.409
That is, there's information about the proposed link between

70
00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:53.509
a present lifetime and the alleged previous lifetime.

71
00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:57.807
And deal only with things that I can write about, I can take

72
00:03:57.807 --> 00:04:01.667
pictures of, I can measure, that I show to other people in

73
00:04:01.667 --> 00:04:05.107
my book or in presentations, that they too can then

74
00:04:05.107 --> 00:04:07.745
go look at it and they can go test it.

75
00:04:07.745 --> 00:04:08.851
And they can say Paul, you didn't

76
00:04:08.851 --> 00:04:11.911
interpret that correctly or, Paul, you didn't measure

77
00:04:11.911 --> 00:04:16.871
that physical resemblance very well.

78
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:18.845
Your technique is no good.

79
00:04:18.845 --> 00:04:21.375
It's not valid.

80
00:04:21.375 --> 00:04:24.923
Then we can have a dialogue and I can say,

81
00:04:24.923 --> 00:04:25.663
Oh, wait a minute.

82
00:04:25.663 --> 00:04:27.619
This is the way I approached the evidence.

83
00:04:27.619 --> 00:04:29.259
This is what I've collected.

84
00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.019
This is how I've interpreted it.

85
00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:34.769
Would you take the same material and reinterpret

86
00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:36.519
it from your point of view if you think I've done it

87
00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:40.951
incorrectly and let's look at it as a scientific process

88
00:04:40.951 --> 00:04:45.311
which has to be replicated by another person, has

89
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:48.791
to be observed and evaluated by independent person.

90
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:53.791
And to see how close their conclusions are to mine.

91
00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:58.151
I thought, if we could get to that level of discussion about

92
00:04:58.151 --> 00:05:03.151
reincarnation, it might make enough impact that it would

93
00:05:03.652 --> 00:05:08.181
really change the behavior of the individuals involved.

94
00:05:08.181 --> 00:05:11.421
It might really change the psychological state,

95
00:05:11.421 --> 00:05:14.301
the world view of people.

96
00:05:14.301 --> 00:05:18.061
So I said, let's test that out. Let's see.

97
00:05:18.061 --> 00:05:20.591
So I was involved with a number of groups who are looking

98
00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:23.011
at reincarnation, but looking at it from what I considered

99
00:05:23.011 --> 00:05:25.071
to be a very narrow perspective.

100
00:05:25.071 --> 00:05:27.791
They've either had a psychic input of information.

101
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:32.791
They've had a therapeutic dream or a past life regression

102
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:35.971
and it's given them a label.

103
00:05:35.971 --> 00:05:39.861
And I am the reincarnation of the Joan of Arc.

104
00:05:39.861 --> 00:05:42.061
They feel good about it.

105
00:05:42.061 --> 00:05:44.972
I'm the reincarnation of a soldier who had his head

106
00:05:44.972 --> 00:05:49.972
chopped off and I'm no longer afraid of being cut at my

107
00:05:50.452 --> 00:05:54.272
throat because no I recognize that was a traumatic

108
00:05:54.272 --> 00:05:57.891
experience from the past, but nothing else changes.

109
00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:02.891
Because people would get a clue to a potential lifetime

110
00:06:03.452 --> 00:06:08.452
in the past and accept it without any validation, without

111
00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:12.851
any corroboration from other sources or from other material.

112
00:06:12.851 --> 00:06:15.492
And I thought, maybe that's the reason it's not making a

113
00:06:15.492 --> 00:06:19.111
difference because it is not robust enough.

114
00:06:19.111 --> 00:06:21.412
<v Woman>It would seem then at that point, if someone</v>

115
00:06:21.412 --> 00:06:24.123
were to be given a glimpse of something that has some

116
00:06:24.123 --> 00:06:26.284
truth in it, for example.

117
00:06:26.284 --> 00:06:29.403
If it's revealed, even in those little snippets without any

118
00:06:29.403 --> 00:06:32.563
further evaluation, wouldn't it still be incumbent upon

119
00:06:32.563 --> 00:06:35.284
a person to maybe delve into it a little bit more and

120
00:06:35.284 --> 00:06:37.904
understand why have I been shown this?

121
00:06:37.904 --> 00:06:39.425
Or why has this been revealed?

122
00:06:39.425 --> 00:06:42.465
What is the responsibility now in knowing this?

123
00:06:42.465 --> 00:06:46.144
<v ->Well, people do talk about it in those terms.</v>

124
00:06:46.144 --> 00:06:51.144
Well, gee I have a responsibility to live a life that

125
00:06:52.464 --> 00:06:57.122
St. Thomas would have lived, but, you see, that's

126
00:06:57.122 --> 00:06:59.942
at a level of abstraction.

127
00:06:59.942 --> 00:07:04.102
That doesn't change people at the fundamental

128
00:07:04.102 --> 00:07:06.522
level of personality.

129
00:07:06.522 --> 00:07:09.982
So anyone who's looked at developmental theory in

130
00:07:09.982 --> 00:07:13.742
psychology, which has been my area of focus in psychology

131
00:07:13.742 --> 00:07:17.442
is to try to understand how do we individuate and

132
00:07:17.442 --> 00:07:21.662
differentiate into the unique individuals that we are.

133
00:07:21.662 --> 00:07:24.862
Because simple explanations don't account for the complexity

134
00:07:24.862 --> 00:07:28.478
of the humans that we have become.

135
00:07:28.478 --> 00:07:33.478
So I felt that if change is really going to happen

136
00:07:35.258 --> 00:07:39.218
at a level of interiority, if we want to use that term,

137
00:07:39.218 --> 00:07:43.918
at the inner sense of self, then you've got to have a

138
00:07:43.918 --> 00:07:48.828
psychological process of what I call,

139
00:07:48.828 --> 00:07:52.116
realistic, validatible learning.

140
00:07:52.116 --> 00:07:55.716
I remember working with Chris Argyris at Harvard

141
00:07:55.716 --> 00:08:00.096
about 30 years ago, and his point was learning theory.

142
00:08:00.096 --> 00:08:02.596
And he and I were going to work together in some thing

143
00:08:02.596 --> 00:08:05.075
in some things in the state department later on

144
00:08:05.075 --> 00:08:07.915
to try and improve professional change.

145
00:08:07.915 --> 00:08:09.654
And professional change means changing

146
00:08:09.654 --> 00:08:11.775
the kind of person you are.

147
00:08:11.775 --> 00:08:16.595
His theory was you don't have that kind of fundamental

148
00:08:16.595 --> 00:08:20.875
change, learning to be a new and different kind of person,

149
00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:24.695
unless there is a profound realization that your basic

150
00:08:24.695 --> 00:08:28.874
assumptions are wrong.

151
00:08:28.874 --> 00:08:32.253
Then you've got to say, I recognize that my

152
00:08:32.253 --> 00:08:36.793
assumptions have been wrong about subject X, Y, or Z.

153
00:08:36.793 --> 00:08:40.693
I've got to learn what is a better explanation.

154
00:08:40.693 --> 00:08:44.613
I've got to learn why I made a mistake.

155
00:08:44.613 --> 00:08:48.673
So I've taken that mentality, which came out of a totally

156
00:08:48.673 --> 00:08:52.333
different part of my life and career, and said we ought

157
00:08:52.333 --> 00:08:54.551
to apply that to reincarnation research.

158
00:08:54.551 --> 00:08:55.411
<v Woman>That makes sense.</v>

159
00:08:55.411 --> 00:09:00.411
Now, did I understand correctly, were you in the world of,

160
00:09:00.792 --> 00:09:02.351
were you a minister at one time?

161
00:09:02.351 --> 00:09:05.831
<v ->Well, I started out my early career in graduate school</v>

162
00:09:05.831 --> 00:09:07.931
I was studying clinical psychology.

163
00:09:07.931 --> 00:09:09.191
I was an ordained minster.

164
00:09:09.191 --> 00:09:11.711
I had a small church outside of Tallahassee, Florida

165
00:09:11.711 --> 00:09:13.991
where I was at Florida State University.

166
00:09:13.991 --> 00:09:18.391
And I was going to be a psychological counselor

167
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.211
from a religious orientation.

168
00:09:20.211 --> 00:09:21.951
<v Woman>So it's interesting because neither one of these</v>

169
00:09:21.951 --> 00:09:25.411
would support a future research in reincarnation.

170
00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:26.645
<v ->Absolutely not. (woman laughs)</v>

171
00:09:26.645 --> 00:09:28.685
<v Woman>So you had to look at what wasn't working,</v>

172
00:09:28.685 --> 00:09:31.565
which of your suppositions weren't working in showing

173
00:09:31.565 --> 00:09:33.515
you the entire truth.

174
00:09:33.515 --> 00:09:37.123
<v ->Well, first of all, the whole discipline of psychology</v>

175
00:09:37.123 --> 00:09:40.863
in the 1960s, '70s, '80s, '90s and up to the present,

176
00:09:40.863 --> 00:09:45.863
has no plausible developmental theory to explain

177
00:09:47.883 --> 00:09:52.463
the uniqueness and the differentiation of human

178
00:09:52.463 --> 00:09:56.003
personalities as we experience it in our own lives and

179
00:09:56.003 --> 00:09:59.513
as we observe in other people.

180
00:09:59.513 --> 00:10:03.541
I really spent a lot of time, while I was doing other things

181
00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:06.921
I mean, the ministering, counseling and in the Navy

182
00:10:06.921 --> 00:10:09.421
and the diplomatic service and so on.

183
00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:14.061
I was always involved in those professional roles with

184
00:10:14.061 --> 00:10:17.141
sort of another eye up here, saying

185
00:10:17.141 --> 00:10:20.661
why is the situation the way it is?

186
00:10:20.661 --> 00:10:23.841
Why are people behaving the way they behave?

187
00:10:23.841 --> 00:10:28.661
And so my work at Harvard in the mid '70s with

188
00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:31.241
psychologists David McClelland and Christ Argyris,

189
00:10:31.241 --> 00:10:34.521
that I mentioned earlier, was also driven by that urge

190
00:10:34.521 --> 00:10:36.321
to understand.

191
00:10:36.321 --> 00:10:40.679
But people respond in unique ways

192
00:10:40.679 --> 00:10:42.459
that cannot be explained by their

193
00:10:42.459 --> 00:10:47.039
family environment, by their early childhood culture.

194
00:10:47.039 --> 00:10:49.759
They make decisions, they know who they are, they define

195
00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:53.519
themselves at a very precocious level.

196
00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:56.779
And I'm not talking about just prodigies who are doing

197
00:10:56.779 --> 00:11:01.739
symphonies at age eight as Mozart did or becoming

198
00:11:01.739 --> 00:11:06.739
mathematical geniuses as people have at age nine.

199
00:11:06.819 --> 00:11:10.237
I'm talking about all of us.

200
00:11:10.237 --> 00:11:15.237
We have those kinds of, what I call, precocity.

201
00:11:15.277 --> 00:11:17.497
We are precocious.

202
00:11:17.497 --> 00:11:22.177
We know things at early ages that we haven't learned,

203
00:11:22.177 --> 00:11:24.691
no one has talked to us about, we haven't read about them,

204
00:11:24.691 --> 00:11:26.031
we haven't been exposed to them,

205
00:11:26.031 --> 00:11:27.631
but we have beliefs in them.

206
00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:31.551
Research going on a Yale University right now,

207
00:11:31.551 --> 00:11:35.969
people are looking at children who hold beliefs in the

208
00:11:35.969 --> 00:11:39.569
multi-dimensionality of the universe, who hold beliefs

209
00:11:39.569 --> 00:11:43.407
about the transcendent nature of consciousness at very

210
00:11:43.407 --> 00:11:45.687
young ages and they resist adults telling

211
00:11:45.687 --> 00:11:48.087
them that it's wrong.

212
00:11:48.087 --> 00:11:51.527
Now, where does that strength of conviction come from?

213
00:11:51.527 --> 00:11:53.187
<v Woman>Yes. That's a wonderful case in point.</v>

214
00:11:53.187 --> 00:11:56.537
<v ->The developmental theories that I studied in psychology</v>

215
00:11:56.537 --> 00:11:58.843
did not explain it.

216
00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:03.843
The theologies of the western religions did not explain it

217
00:12:04.823 --> 00:12:08.603
because there you're supposed to be the servant of a God's

218
00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:11.703
blueprint for your individual life and you have only one

219
00:12:11.703 --> 00:12:15.103
choice to make which is to accept the path to salvation

220
00:12:15.103 --> 00:12:20.103
that your particular church puts forth.

221
00:12:20.963 --> 00:12:24.514
There's no room in that theology for individual

222
00:12:24.514 --> 00:12:29.514
self-differentiation, for free will, for self-control and

223
00:12:30.394 --> 00:12:35.314
direction, self-actualization as Carl Rogers would call it.

224
00:12:36.184 --> 00:12:39.044
No theories were explaining that.

225
00:12:39.044 --> 00:12:42.164
So when I began to, as I started out, in answer to your

226
00:12:42.164 --> 00:12:45.604
first question, doing this research on this book,

227
00:12:45.604 --> 00:12:50.604
I picked up a lot of the individually researched and best

228
00:12:50.814 --> 00:12:55.814
cases where people had documented very well the

229
00:12:58.974 --> 00:13:03.974
full picture, the full measure of a past life, and described

230
00:13:04.174 --> 00:13:08.834
their own present life in terms of cognitive ways of

231
00:13:08.834 --> 00:13:13.834
thought, analysis, thinking, emotional patterns and styles

232
00:13:14.944 --> 00:13:18.464
of behavior, inner personal ways of dealing with the

233
00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:20.684
world and universe and other people.

234
00:13:20.684 --> 00:13:23.924
In other words, they had talked about all of this data

235
00:13:23.924 --> 00:13:28.504
not in my terms as a psychologist looking at it and putting

236
00:13:28.504 --> 00:13:33.504
these labels on it, but in terms of the raw data.

237
00:13:34.524 --> 00:13:39.524
The point of intuition that I mentioned to in some of our

238
00:13:39.824 --> 00:13:43.984
earlier, private conversations, the book, although it's a

239
00:13:43.984 --> 00:13:48.984
very scientific approach to testing this data, I think it's

240
00:13:49.604 --> 00:13:54.604
like all innovations in technology and in scientific

241
00:13:55.165 --> 00:13:59.104
concepts and research, the first moment is sort of

242
00:13:59.104 --> 00:14:02.184
an ah-ha moment of intuition.

243
00:14:02.184 --> 00:14:04.784
When I looked at all of that raw data in these dozens

244
00:14:04.784 --> 00:14:09.784
of cases, and I saw that each one of them was in its own way

245
00:14:11.044 --> 00:14:15.224
painting a picture that was a picture of a whole being,

246
00:14:15.224 --> 00:14:19.344
not just some ethereal concept, not just a name,

247
00:14:19.344 --> 00:14:24.344
not just a historical reputation, but a robust person.

248
00:14:25.624 --> 00:14:28.544
So I said, wow.

249
00:14:28.544 --> 00:14:31.724
If this is what reincarnation does, if reincarnation

250
00:14:31.724 --> 00:14:36.644
involves the totality of a being, not that it is an

251
00:14:36.644 --> 00:14:41.644
identical thing, but that if the legacy of past lives,

252
00:14:41.804 --> 00:14:45.445
that gets somehow transmitted into our current lifetime,

253
00:14:45.445 --> 00:14:49.424
if it has that kind of influence on all aspects of

254
00:14:49.424 --> 00:14:54.424
who we are, then it is a robust natural process that

255
00:14:56.324 --> 00:15:00.924
affects all humans, it's a part of our legacy.

256
00:15:00.924 --> 00:15:04.904
Then, I had to admit to myself that it wasn't a new idea

257
00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:09.904
to me, but Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, before Darwin,

258
00:15:10.104 --> 00:15:14.764
had the notion that in the process of evolution,

259
00:15:14.764 --> 00:15:18.124
more than just these physical characteristics that

260
00:15:18.124 --> 00:15:20.764
Darwin focused on were involved.

261
00:15:20.764 --> 00:15:24.264
Well, Darwin won the publicity battle.

262
00:15:24.264 --> 00:15:26.824
Lamarck got cast aside.

263
00:15:26.824 --> 00:15:31.824
But in effect, what I'm reviving here is not a new idea

264
00:15:31.884 --> 00:15:36.884
but it is a more extensive elaboration, a more structurally

265
00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:44.104
defined concept than Lamarck was playing with.

266
00:15:44.884 --> 00:15:48.145
So I said, all right, if this is what's involved in

267
00:15:48.145 --> 00:15:52.204
reincarnation, the totality of our being physically,

268
00:15:52.204 --> 00:15:55.564
cognitively, emotionally, inner personally, in terms

269
00:15:55.564 --> 00:15:58.204
of our creative directions and so on.

270
00:15:58.204 --> 00:16:02.004
I got all excited about it, as I express it here.

271
00:16:02.004 --> 00:16:06.044
I said, let's try to test that hypothesis.

272
00:16:06.044 --> 00:16:09.584
Because if it's real, we ought to be able to test it.

273
00:16:09.584 --> 00:16:12.855
So, I took all these cases and started, as I mentioned

274
00:16:12.855 --> 00:16:15.135
in one of the presentation that, Regina, you and I

275
00:16:15.135 --> 00:16:19.435
had participated in.

276
00:16:19.435 --> 00:16:22.935
I used, I'm an old fashioned guy, you know, I'm from

277
00:16:22.935 --> 00:16:25.735
the '50s and '60s and technology is-

278
00:16:25.735 --> 00:16:28.396
I'm a troglodyte in modern technology.

279
00:16:28.396 --> 00:16:31.795
But I thought in terms of the old overhead projector

280
00:16:31.795 --> 00:16:34.995
and the way we'd put things together with a template

281
00:16:34.995 --> 00:16:39.266
and, you know, if I wanted to show a whole schema to an

282
00:16:39.266 --> 00:16:41.946
audience, I would have a piece of it on one and a piece

283
00:16:41.946 --> 00:16:44.946
on the other and I would lay the pieces on top,

284
00:16:44.946 --> 00:16:46.686
and at the end they'd see the whole picture of what

285
00:16:46.686 --> 00:16:48.326
I was trying to show.

286
00:16:48.326 --> 00:16:49.566
Well, that's what happened in terms

287
00:16:49.566 --> 00:16:52.026
of the reincarnation research.

288
00:16:52.026 --> 00:16:56.646
One case, I'd look at it and it had these areas of data.

289
00:16:56.646 --> 00:16:58.426
Another one had these areas of data.

290
00:16:58.426 --> 00:17:01.086
Little bit different, different terminology,

291
00:17:01.086 --> 00:17:03.226
different perspectives.

292
00:17:03.226 --> 00:17:08.226
But looking at it from a generic kind of classification

293
00:17:08.966 --> 00:17:12.046
perspective, which is what psychologists do when they

294
00:17:12.046 --> 00:17:16.086
try to develop personality tests and IQ tests and all that.

295
00:17:16.086 --> 00:17:17.906
We try to look for patterns in the underlying

296
00:17:17.906 --> 00:17:20.006
structures of thing.

297
00:17:20.006 --> 00:17:25.006
And to me, and to my eyes, it was a very solid structure.

298
00:17:27.586 --> 00:17:31.206
So I said, okay, what are the components of it?

299
00:17:31.206 --> 00:17:32.826
At that time I didn't know.

300
00:17:32.826 --> 00:17:37.266
And that's when this intuition came, I said, we've

301
00:17:37.266 --> 00:17:42.266
got a mental part, the way of thinking, analysis, critical

302
00:17:42.627 --> 00:17:45.326
thinking, are intuitive.

303
00:17:45.326 --> 00:17:49.346
You see, we fall somewhere on that spectrum, everybody does.

304
00:17:49.346 --> 00:17:52.307
But the past life that I'm looking at in this case, and the

305
00:17:52.307 --> 00:17:54.996
present life has the same pattern.

306
00:17:54.996 --> 00:17:56.096
<v Woman>Let's talk about that.</v>

307
00:17:56.096 --> 00:17:59.066
Let's get into a couple of specifics that have either

308
00:17:59.066 --> 00:18:01.586
previously been recorded in books by other people

309
00:18:01.586 --> 00:18:04.506
that you consider to be, as you say, among the most robust

310
00:18:04.506 --> 00:18:08.256
cases, so you can give examples side-by-side of exactly

311
00:18:08.256 --> 00:18:10.136
what you're talking about.

312
00:18:10.136 --> 00:18:12.136
I mean, you can go with the confederate soldier,

313
00:18:12.136 --> 00:18:13.596
or whoever you wish.

314
00:18:13.596 --> 00:18:16.596
<v ->Well, that's a good case because this book and</v>

315
00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:20.756
Jeff Keene is the author of the book, and it's his own case.

316
00:18:20.756 --> 00:18:23.776
He discovered through an emotional experience on one of

317
00:18:23.776 --> 00:18:27.996
the battlefields of the Civil War, where he had an emotional

318
00:18:27.996 --> 00:18:30.847
experience that he could not explain in any other way.

319
00:18:30.847 --> 00:18:35.306
And was told by a friend that might have some past life

320
00:18:35.306 --> 00:18:37.526
implications for you.

321
00:18:37.526 --> 00:18:41.806
He sort of tried to see what that meant and he didn't really

322
00:18:41.806 --> 00:18:46.806
have a lead until he saw a picture of a confederate soldier

323
00:18:50.017 --> 00:18:53.437
and he held it up and he said, "I recognize that guy.

324
00:18:53.437 --> 00:18:56.357
"I shave his face in the morning."

325
00:18:56.357 --> 00:19:00.317
So, you know, this really got his attention.

326
00:19:00.317 --> 00:19:01.937
<v Woman>Did he have a lot of physical characteristics?</v>

327
00:19:01.937 --> 00:19:04.357
<v ->The physical characteristics, and I have done, as I</v>

328
00:19:04.357 --> 00:19:06.437
mentioned in the book, I have taken his -

329
00:19:06.437 --> 00:19:10.617
he wrote a book, he developed all this raw data, stories

330
00:19:10.617 --> 00:19:14.597
anecdotes about how he has similar experiences,

331
00:19:14.597 --> 00:19:18.017
similar attitudes and so on to this confederate soldier

332
00:19:18.017 --> 00:19:21.457
who became a general in the confederate army.

333
00:19:21.457 --> 00:19:25.177
But Jeff was looking at it just as an ordinary human being

334
00:19:25.177 --> 00:19:26.957
saying I see all these similarities.

335
00:19:26.957 --> 00:19:29.817
And he has them all mixed up in the book and so forth.

336
00:19:29.817 --> 00:19:31.037
Well, I took his book.

337
00:19:31.037 --> 00:19:34.577
That's when I did, he's one of the templates.

338
00:19:34.577 --> 00:19:38.177
His areas of evidence filled in this part of the picture.

339
00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:41.277
So you had the physical features that were very similar,

340
00:19:41.277 --> 00:19:45.337
not just the facial geometry, which some people have looked

341
00:19:45.337 --> 00:19:48.597
at in their research and I was looking at.

342
00:19:48.597 --> 00:19:51.637
But also the body type, and the hair and ear and hand

343
00:19:51.637 --> 00:19:55.037
proportions and those kinds of features that have been

344
00:19:55.037 --> 00:19:59.558
shown by metric science to be the more genetically stable

345
00:19:59.558 --> 00:20:03.677
parts of our physical features.

346
00:20:03.677 --> 00:20:07.517
He not only had that, but then I started asking, okay

347
00:20:07.517 --> 00:20:10.837
if there's a way of thinking here, let me read some of the

348
00:20:10.837 --> 00:20:15.157
material that Jeff wrote in his book about the way he thinks

349
00:20:15.157 --> 00:20:20.157
and the way John Gordon, the confederate guy thought

350
00:20:21.097 --> 00:20:24.497
because I had quotes from history books of his writing

351
00:20:24.497 --> 00:20:26.827
and his comments and so forth.

352
00:20:26.827 --> 00:20:29.952
And because of the work I'd done in this Harvard research,

353
00:20:29.952 --> 00:20:34.952
looking at speeches of politicians, and the articles of

354
00:20:34.972 --> 00:20:39.692
ministers, and cases of lawyers and so on,

355
00:20:39.692 --> 00:20:42.812
to infer what their

356
00:20:42.812 --> 00:20:43.812
<v Woman>Mindset, right.</v>

357
00:20:43.812 --> 00:20:46.492
<v ->Approach to thinking was and the mindsets were.</v>

358
00:20:46.492 --> 00:20:50.952
I used the same approach to look at Jeff Keene, the current

359
00:20:50.952 --> 00:20:55.272
living retired fireman in Connecticut with a long dead

360
00:20:55.272 --> 00:20:57.052
confederate general.

361
00:20:57.052 --> 00:20:58.832
The patterns were the same.

362
00:20:58.832 --> 00:21:01.372
I said, let me look at the emotions.

363
00:21:01.372 --> 00:21:04.772
Are these guys, do they have the same sort of emotional

364
00:21:04.772 --> 00:21:08.042
reaction to similar circumstances?

365
00:21:09.232 --> 00:21:14.232
Read some of Gordon's letters, how he talked about battle,

366
00:21:15.654 --> 00:21:19.684
losing his comrades in the war, I mean, the trauma

367
00:21:19.684 --> 00:21:23.045
and how he was balancing his personal feelings with

368
00:21:23.045 --> 00:21:27.344
his sense of duty as the leader.

369
00:21:27.344 --> 00:21:32.344
Look at some of the things that Jeff Keene had written

370
00:21:32.505 --> 00:21:37.195
about his men being in a burning house,

371
00:21:37.195 --> 00:21:39.903
subjecting themselves to danger.

372
00:21:39.903 --> 00:21:42.743
He as the assistant chief having to stand back

373
00:21:42.743 --> 00:21:44.643
and direct this.

374
00:21:44.643 --> 00:21:48.783
These are his buddies in there in danger.

375
00:21:48.783 --> 00:21:52.123
The same patterns were coming through.

376
00:21:52.941 --> 00:21:55.181
Then I looked and said, well how about

377
00:21:55.181 --> 00:21:57.281
the careers of these guys.

378
00:21:57.281 --> 00:22:01.281
Obviously they were both, you know, in structured

379
00:22:01.281 --> 00:22:05.161
hierarchical organizations, the military, the army,

380
00:22:05.161 --> 00:22:09.551
the airforce, the firefighting department.

381
00:22:10.691 --> 00:22:15.691
These were psychologically the kind of structures

382
00:22:17.331 --> 00:22:22.331
that a particular kind of personality needs.

383
00:22:22.851 --> 00:22:25.051
Another hit. Another match.

384
00:22:25.051 --> 00:22:28.271
And it goes on in that particular case.

385
00:22:28.271 --> 00:22:33.271
Not only when they finish their duties as authoritarian,

386
00:22:34.011 --> 00:22:39.011
structure oriented, military careers,

387
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:44.330
they have a sense of service to the citizenry.

388
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:48.050
Get involved in education and public service.

389
00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:53.050
Gordon in politics. Jeff Keene in education and so on.

390
00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:55.450
Well, that's only one case.

391
00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:56.960
Take Peter Teekamp.

392
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.800
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

393
00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.730
<v ->And Paul Gauguin.</v>

394
00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:59.691
<v Woman>Yes, that was interesting.</v>

395
00:22:59.691 --> 00:23:03.844
<v ->Now, Peter's case started on his own with people</v>

396
00:23:03.844 --> 00:23:07.664
just saying to him, you remind me of Paul Gauguin,

397
00:23:07.664 --> 00:23:11.804
and he just brushed it off for a decade or so.

398
00:23:11.804 --> 00:23:14.464
Three different significant people said that to him.

399
00:23:14.464 --> 00:23:17.604
And then as he got into his research, looking more carefully

400
00:23:17.604 --> 00:23:21.324
and closely at Paul Gauguin's paintings, he discovered

401
00:23:21.324 --> 00:23:22.944
something in those paintings that other

402
00:23:22.944 --> 00:23:24.984
art critics had never noticed.

403
00:23:24.984 --> 00:23:29.984
Tiny faces hidden away in small parts of the paintings.

404
00:23:30.704 --> 00:23:34.264
Well, now that discovery was significant enough in itself,

405
00:23:34.264 --> 00:23:37.764
but Peter Teekamp did the same thing.

406
00:23:37.764 --> 00:23:40.404
And had been doing it all of his life,

407
00:23:40.404 --> 00:23:42.744
and that got his attention.

408
00:23:42.744 --> 00:23:44.002
Why am I doing that?

409
00:23:44.002 --> 00:23:44.964
<v Woman>As an artist.</v>

410
00:23:44.964 --> 00:23:45.854
<v ->As an artist.</v>

411
00:23:45.854 --> 00:23:46.776
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

412
00:23:46.776 --> 00:23:48.736
<v ->And I find that this guy</v>

413
00:23:48.736 --> 00:23:50.296
<v Woman>Was doing the same thing.</v>

414
00:23:50.296 --> 00:23:52.312
<v ->Doing the same thing 150 years ago.</v>

415
00:23:52.312 --> 00:23:53.492
<v Woman>Right.</v>

416
00:23:53.492 --> 00:23:57.252
<v ->And so then he began to explore and study more</v>

417
00:23:57.252 --> 00:24:01.512
and begin to feel that maybe there was a combination

418
00:24:01.512 --> 00:24:04.472
of factors that might suggest he ought to look at it

419
00:24:04.472 --> 00:24:05.772
more seriously.

420
00:24:05.772 --> 00:24:10.772
So he met Michele Moshay who now, it turns out,

421
00:24:12.608 --> 00:24:17.608
as other researchers have evaluated it, as Peter and Michele

422
00:24:18.343 --> 00:24:21.683
have evaluated it, and as now I have finally done with

423
00:24:21.683 --> 00:24:26.123
my multi-factored package.

424
00:24:26.123 --> 00:24:30.443
They are, if anybody today is reincarnated as

425
00:24:30.443 --> 00:24:34.081
Mette Gauguin and Paul Gauguin,

426
00:24:34.081 --> 00:24:37.501
it's Michele Moshay and Peter Teekamp.

427
00:24:37.501 --> 00:24:39.561
Now, you notice I said that carefully.

428
00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:43.682
I'm not declaring one hundred percent certitude that

429
00:24:43.682 --> 00:24:47.521
this is the reincarnation of the same soul that was in

430
00:24:47.521 --> 00:24:52.521
Paul and the same soul that was evolved in Mette Gauguin.

431
00:24:54.141 --> 00:24:59.041
But I'm suggesting that when you have that kind of body of

432
00:24:59.041 --> 00:25:04.041
correspondences, it's hard to say.

433
00:25:05.239 --> 00:25:09.949
It is sort of foolish to say, oh, that's just by accident.

434
00:25:09.949 --> 00:25:14.610
You happen to find two people that resemble each other

435
00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:18.090
this closely by chance.

436
00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:20.770
So, doing that with a number of cases.

437
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.490
So I took some of those cases that had already been

438
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:26.400
published and I wanted to take it through the next step.

439
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.808
And these people like Jeff Keene and Peter and Mette and

440
00:25:30.808 --> 00:25:33.786
a few other people who were willing to let their

441
00:25:33.786 --> 00:25:37.106
books be used, let their material be used

442
00:25:37.106 --> 00:25:40.686
and who were willing to go the next step to engage

443
00:25:40.686 --> 00:25:45.046
themselves in the psychological process of evaluation.

444
00:25:45.046 --> 00:25:47.926
So we had interviews. I had their material.

445
00:25:47.926 --> 00:25:49.506
They let me have their writings.

446
00:25:49.506 --> 00:25:53.566
They let me have any of their private information.

447
00:25:53.566 --> 00:25:56.286
They went through a rigorous psychological interview

448
00:25:56.286 --> 00:26:00.526
where I was looking for the clues of these various profiles.

449
00:26:00.526 --> 00:26:05.526
And I tried out my evaluations on them and in most

450
00:26:06.626 --> 00:26:10.906
instances, this is not boasting about my perspicacity

451
00:26:10.906 --> 00:26:14.126
as a analyst, but in most cases they agreed.

452
00:26:14.126 --> 00:26:18.666
"Paul, yeah, that fits me."

453
00:26:18.666 --> 00:26:23.226
And I say, do you know what also fits, Paul Gauguin.

454
00:26:23.226 --> 00:26:28.226
It also fits Mette Gad Gauguin.

455
00:26:28.226 --> 00:26:33.006
So they say, "Wow."

456
00:26:33.006 --> 00:26:36.086
What's happened, and the feedback I've gotten from

457
00:26:36.086 --> 00:26:39.566
people, after going through this process of, not only,

458
00:26:39.566 --> 00:26:42.606
thinking of themselves in terms of a name, in terms of

459
00:26:42.606 --> 00:26:45.646
maybe being an artist and he was an artist, or in terms

460
00:26:45.646 --> 00:26:50.536
of some spiritual concept of that soul is now in me.

461
00:26:52.606 --> 00:26:55.724
They used terms like, and I have a wonderful email

462
00:26:55.724 --> 00:27:00.724
from Michele on this saying, "I've never felt so complete,

463
00:27:01.184 --> 00:27:04.904
"and whole, and confident of this case that we've been

464
00:27:04.904 --> 00:27:09.904
"working on for the last fifteen plus years.

465
00:27:10.164 --> 00:27:13.244
"This has changed my life."

466
00:27:13.244 --> 00:27:14.844
<v Woman>In what ways are you finding that it</v>

467
00:27:14.844 --> 00:27:17.124
changes people's lives?

468
00:27:17.124 --> 00:27:21.184
To have this kind of moving closer to certainty?

469
00:27:21.184 --> 00:27:24.704
<v ->Moving closer to certainty in all of these areas,</v>

470
00:27:24.704 --> 00:27:27.564
I mean, they take it seriously.

471
00:27:27.564 --> 00:27:31.924
They now look at their own decisions, they look at their

472
00:27:31.924 --> 00:27:36.904
own life choices as they're making them now, in the

473
00:27:36.904 --> 00:27:41.904
context of an evolving personality that they understand

474
00:27:42.404 --> 00:27:45.524
some of their roots in the past, and they understand

475
00:27:45.524 --> 00:27:48.804
some of the implications of that legacy in the early

476
00:27:48.804 --> 00:27:50.664
years of this life.

477
00:27:50.664 --> 00:27:54.504
And Peter is a wonderful example because he's had his own

478
00:27:54.504 --> 00:27:57.644
suicidal episodes, just as Paul Gauguin did.

479
00:27:57.644 --> 00:28:00.424
He's had his own family breakup, his own alienation

480
00:28:00.424 --> 00:28:03.824
from his children, as Paul Gauguin did.

481
00:28:03.824 --> 00:28:08.824
But now that he is aware of this legacy and its impact

482
00:28:10.804 --> 00:28:15.804
and his ability to make some choices, he is changing.

483
00:28:16.184 --> 00:28:20.484
He is now reintegrating his children into his life.

484
00:28:20.484 --> 00:28:25.184
He is now thinking in terms of a responsibility, if this is

485
00:28:25.184 --> 00:28:30.184
what that life in the past contributed to the way I started

486
00:28:30.484 --> 00:28:35.484
this life, I'm thinking of what my legacy is going to be

487
00:28:35.564 --> 00:28:40.564
in the person who is animated by this same psychoplasm

488
00:28:41.264 --> 00:28:44.704
or soul genome that has animated me.

489
00:28:44.704 --> 00:28:47.324
And I have some choices to make and I can make

490
00:28:47.324 --> 00:28:51.164
different decisions, I can go in different directions.

491
00:28:51.164 --> 00:28:56.164
And it is, when you go through this process of owning

492
00:28:58.884 --> 00:29:03.884
at a visceral level this legacy,

493
00:29:05.538 --> 00:29:10.538
you are a very weird, dead soul if you can't have

494
00:29:14.894 --> 00:29:18.812
a sense of some self-responsibility for the next step.

495
00:29:18.812 --> 00:29:22.712
And I say that because there are no weird, dead soul.

496
00:29:22.712 --> 00:29:26.572
I mean, we are conscious beings,

497
00:29:26.572 --> 00:29:31.572
consciously evolving beings, and once you own that,

498
00:29:31.992 --> 00:29:36.992
you can't help but see the implications.

499
00:29:37.092 --> 00:29:40.532
This is what karma, see when I was first writing the book

500
00:29:40.532 --> 00:29:44.652
in the first direction before I changed directions,

501
00:29:44.652 --> 00:29:47.812
I was talking about karma and more spiritual,

502
00:29:47.812 --> 00:29:52.812
oriental terms, you know, this notion of well,

503
00:29:53.992 --> 00:29:56.852
it's something that the universe imposes on us and

504
00:29:56.852 --> 00:29:59.752
sort of sets it up and we work it out and there's nothing

505
00:29:59.752 --> 00:30:01.092
much we can do about it.

506
00:30:01.092 --> 00:30:03.332
We either work it off or we don't.

507
00:30:03.332 --> 00:30:08.332
Well, I'm sorry to say to the people who feel that way that

508
00:30:08.532 --> 00:30:13.532
that's not the way the evidence seems to suggest it works.

509
00:30:13.712 --> 00:30:18.712
The evidence suggests it works, that you have a legacy

510
00:30:18.932 --> 00:30:23.672
and it influences your behavior, as it came to you,

511
00:30:23.672 --> 00:30:27.552
and it influences you in that direction until you make

512
00:30:27.552 --> 00:30:30.352
conscious choices to change it.

513
00:30:30.352 --> 00:30:32.932
That's the insight.

514
00:30:32.932 --> 00:30:37.932
What's interesting to me is using this western scientific

515
00:30:38.532 --> 00:30:43.532
quote model that I'm using, it has revealed the fragility,

516
00:30:45.372 --> 00:30:50.372
the ethereality, the lack of force in power of these

517
00:30:50.652 --> 00:30:54.752
more ethereal traditions because they'd been

518
00:30:54.752 --> 00:30:57.072
comfort giving, you see.

519
00:30:57.072 --> 00:30:59.612
They make us feel good because we don't have any

520
00:30:59.612 --> 00:31:01.950
responsibility, you see.

521
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:05.108
It's sort of at this level that we don't have any

522
00:31:05.108 --> 00:31:08.128
control over, but when you get to the nitty gritty

523
00:31:08.128 --> 00:31:12.968
of looking at reincarnation as a real phenomenon

524
00:31:12.968 --> 00:31:16.348
it effects not only the way I look, but the way I'm going

525
00:31:16.348 --> 00:31:19.948
to make decisions about the people I'm going to be

526
00:31:19.948 --> 00:31:24.948
in love with, partner with, marry, work with, fight against.

527
00:31:25.568 --> 00:31:29.406
The choices that I make are going to be influenced by this

528
00:31:29.406 --> 00:31:32.886
legacy and I have to make conscious decisions to overcome

529
00:31:32.886 --> 00:31:34.666
that influence.

530
00:31:34.666 --> 00:31:38.166
Then, you know, you can't escape the responsibility

531
00:31:38.166 --> 00:31:41.666
for the original meaning of karma, which if you go back

532
00:31:41.666 --> 00:31:45.512
to the earliest definitions of the word karma, it was a very

533
00:31:45.512 --> 00:31:50.512
simple, natural tradition, the effects of one's actions.

534
00:31:51.598 --> 00:31:55.178
That's as clear as it can be.

535
00:31:55.178 --> 00:31:58.678
So Peter Teekamp says, yeah I've been behaving like a

536
00:31:58.678 --> 00:32:03.458
blank, because I came with that legacy and I didn't

537
00:32:03.458 --> 00:32:06.358
realize it was pushing me.

538
00:32:06.358 --> 00:32:11.358
I gave into those inclinations that I was born with,

539
00:32:13.879 --> 00:32:18.879
but boy now I see that I can change.

540
00:32:19.038 --> 00:32:20.178
I can make a difference.

541
00:32:20.178 --> 00:32:23.638
I don't want to live with that legacy anymore.

542
00:32:23.638 --> 00:32:28.098
It's the kind of thing that a person has who goes through

543
00:32:28.098 --> 00:32:33.098
an authentic therapeutic process of dealing with the

544
00:32:34.158 --> 00:32:37.538
consequences of one's behavior.

545
00:32:37.538 --> 00:32:42.538
Where this behavior could have been either in a

546
00:32:43.236 --> 00:32:46.406
previous life or in the present life.

547
00:32:46.406 --> 00:32:49.206
As you know the whole past life therapy movement

548
00:32:49.206 --> 00:32:53.787
that's been very widespread in the last few decades

549
00:32:53.787 --> 00:32:58.787
really grew out of Freud and his colleagues understandings

550
00:32:59.626 --> 00:33:04.626
of the power of buried trauma in childhood

551
00:33:04.867 --> 00:33:07.587
on a present life.

552
00:33:07.587 --> 00:33:12.587
If the concept that I'm describing works in reincarnation,

553
00:33:13.606 --> 00:33:18.606
which is this integral, singular corpus of a personality.

554
00:33:19.946 --> 00:33:23.127
Then if there's trauma in a past life,

555
00:33:23.127 --> 00:33:26.106
obviously, it comes forward.

556
00:33:26.106 --> 00:33:29.386
And if it hasn't been dealt with in the past life,

557
00:33:29.386 --> 00:33:31.596
it's going to have to be dealt with at some time

558
00:33:31.596 --> 00:33:33.516
in a future lifetime.

559
00:33:33.516 --> 00:33:37.877
And so sometimes it will burst out on its own and cause

560
00:33:37.877 --> 00:33:41.215
difficulties for us that are extreme enough that we're

561
00:33:41.215 --> 00:33:44.055
forced to take action, we're forced to undergo therapeutic

562
00:33:44.055 --> 00:33:47.855
experiences, or self-healing experiences of some kind

563
00:33:47.855 --> 00:33:49.395
or the other.

564
00:33:49.395 --> 00:33:52.435
And if we don't do it this lifetime, it's going to be

565
00:33:52.435 --> 00:33:56.015
part of our legacy that we pass on.

566
00:33:56.015 --> 00:33:58.455
I think one of the interesting things about people now

567
00:33:58.455 --> 00:34:01.795
volunteering to do past life regression and setting

568
00:34:01.795 --> 00:34:06.795
themselves up to quote suffer this traumatic experience

569
00:34:06.955 --> 00:34:10.215
of uncovering lifetimes that have

570
00:34:10.215 --> 00:34:12.795
very negative consequences.

571
00:34:12.795 --> 00:34:17.755
This is speeding up the process of conscious evolution.

572
00:34:17.755 --> 00:34:22.755
In other words, the whole past life therapy movement

573
00:34:23.155 --> 00:34:27.755
is becoming, or has become, and will become more effective

574
00:34:27.755 --> 00:34:30.933
as people understand the greater

575
00:34:30.933 --> 00:34:34.593
impact of what we're talking about.

576
00:34:34.593 --> 00:34:39.593
This is like a whole generation of people consciously

577
00:34:39.673 --> 00:34:44.673
volunteering to undergo some of the self-healing of

578
00:34:46.033 --> 00:34:51.028
past behaviors with consequences that are effecting

579
00:34:51.028 --> 00:34:53.128
society today.

580
00:34:53.128 --> 00:34:54.908
It means it doesn't have to be pushed off

581
00:34:54.908 --> 00:34:57.168
to future lifetimes.

582
00:34:57.168 --> 00:34:59.028
<v Woman>That's ultimate self-responsibility.</v>

583
00:34:59.028 --> 00:35:00.888
<v ->It's ultimate self-responsibility.</v>

584
00:35:00.888 --> 00:35:03.888
And I wouldn't go so far as to say everybody ought to

585
00:35:03.888 --> 00:35:08.168
get into the process and begin to explore their past lives

586
00:35:08.168 --> 00:35:11.748
because some people aren't ready for it yet.

587
00:35:11.748 --> 00:35:16.748
And if you do it too early, before the person has the

588
00:35:17.268 --> 00:35:22.268
experience and either the support system to really

589
00:35:22.488 --> 00:35:24.328
make the changes.

590
00:35:24.328 --> 00:35:29.328
That's why I like the therapeutic processes that take

591
00:35:29.388 --> 00:35:32.328
a considerable amount of time to work through because

592
00:35:32.328 --> 00:35:37.288
then there's a time for an evolutionary process.

593
00:35:37.288 --> 00:35:38.648
<v Woman>Integration of all of that.</v>

594
00:35:38.648 --> 00:35:42.048
<v ->Integration of all of these factors and support from</v>

595
00:35:42.048 --> 00:35:44.608
your therapist, from other people in the group that

596
00:35:44.608 --> 00:35:46.188
you might be working with.

597
00:35:46.188 --> 00:35:50.948
So I'm very disappointed when I hear friends talk about

598
00:35:50.948 --> 00:35:53.326
Oh, I just went to this person and this person wiped away

599
00:35:53.326 --> 00:35:57.444
my karmic debt and I don't have to worry about it anymore.

600
00:35:57.444 --> 00:35:59.564
And I say, come see me in a month.

601
00:35:59.564 --> 00:36:02.642
And in a month they are having the same problems

602
00:36:02.642 --> 00:36:04.782
they had before.

603
00:36:04.782 --> 00:36:09.782
So those are the extremes between an immediate fix.

604
00:36:10.582 --> 00:36:14.862
That sort of thing, in terms of past life karmic healing

605
00:36:14.862 --> 00:36:16.982
is no different than the supernatural religion that

606
00:36:16.982 --> 00:36:19.902
says come and believe in the Lord Jesus, accept him

607
00:36:19.902 --> 00:36:22.742
by his name and you will be saved for eternity.

608
00:36:22.742 --> 00:36:24.542
In other words, it's a magical moment that somebody

609
00:36:24.542 --> 00:36:26.242
else can do for you.

610
00:36:26.242 --> 00:36:29.062
And I'm suggesting that reincarnation is not a

611
00:36:29.062 --> 00:36:30.942
magical moment that somebody can do for you,

612
00:36:30.942 --> 00:36:34.102
it's something that you are involved in as an individual

613
00:36:34.102 --> 00:36:38.502
and you need to go through it in a very serious and

614
00:36:39.892 --> 00:36:42.392
self-responsible manner.

615
00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:45.094
<v Woman>And it has huge implications for, not only,</v>

616
00:36:45.094 --> 00:36:49.374
our own progressive soul or psychoplasm progression

617
00:36:49.374 --> 00:36:52.914
individually, but collectively, and how we interact not

618
00:36:52.914 --> 00:36:56.492
just with each other, but even the earth and all of the

619
00:36:56.492 --> 00:36:59.532
bounty of resources that we've been trashing so badly.

620
00:36:59.532 --> 00:37:01.332
<v ->Absolutely. Well, it effects everything we do.</v>

621
00:37:01.332 --> 00:37:03.112
<v Woman>Well, like the notion, what if we're the ones</v>

622
00:37:03.112 --> 00:37:04.430
that inherit the earth?

623
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:07.389
<v ->Yes. We now say, oh, our children and grandchildren</v>

624
00:37:07.389 --> 00:37:08.789
will inherit the earth.

625
00:37:08.789 --> 00:37:10.949
Well, we are those children and grandchildren,

626
00:37:10.949 --> 00:37:13.149
coming around again.

627
00:37:13.149 --> 00:37:17.129
So if we don't take action to make some progress now,

628
00:37:17.129 --> 00:37:19.389
we're going to be faced with the consequences.

629
00:37:19.389 --> 00:37:20.889
That's karma.

630
00:37:20.889 --> 00:37:25.889
In other words, not being willing to take action to resolve

631
00:37:25.889 --> 00:37:29.249
the negative consequences, the negative influence of

632
00:37:29.249 --> 00:37:34.249
your current behaviors on the future is loading that

633
00:37:34.249 --> 00:37:36.349
down the road of other generations.

634
00:37:36.349 --> 00:37:37.369
<v Woman>That same burden's going to land</v>

635
00:37:37.369 --> 00:37:38.349
right on your shoulders again.

636
00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:39.929
<v ->On your shoulders again.</v>

637
00:37:39.929 --> 00:37:44.369
So, you know, I don't want to make too much

638
00:37:44.369 --> 00:37:45.409
out of my work.

639
00:37:45.409 --> 00:37:46.489
<v Woman>You don't want to preach.</v>

640
00:37:46.489 --> 00:37:49.429
<v ->I stopped preaching a long time ago.</v>

641
00:37:49.429 --> 00:37:52.249
And I don't want to make more out of it

642
00:37:52.249 --> 00:37:54.249
because this is a pilot study.

643
00:37:54.249 --> 00:37:56.049
It is an experiment, as you know.

644
00:37:56.049 --> 00:37:57.729
It's an ongoing experiment.

645
00:37:57.729 --> 00:38:00.489
We have a website where people can come on and read

646
00:38:00.489 --> 00:38:05.489
about the process and look at some cases in progress.

647
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:08.009
They can look at some cases that we've already written

648
00:38:08.009 --> 00:38:11.129
up and see if it triggers anything in their own lives

649
00:38:11.129 --> 00:38:12.569
in their own experiences.

650
00:38:12.569 --> 00:38:14.329
<v Woman>And this is called reincarnation experiment?</v>

651
00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:14.869
<v ->.org</v>

652
00:38:14.869 --> 00:38:15.569
<v Woman>.org</v>

653
00:38:15.569 --> 00:38:15.930
<v ->Yeah.</v>

654
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.439
<v Woman>So if anyone, if this is lighting your jets</v>

655
00:38:18.439 --> 00:38:21.899
and you feel like there's something that's been there

656
00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:24.979
in the background, something in the operating system

657
00:38:24.979 --> 00:38:28.139
that you can kind of feel but don't know what it is yet,

658
00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:29.939
then maybe this is a really good place for people to plug

659
00:38:29.939 --> 00:38:31.719
in and become part of this experiment.

660
00:38:31.719 --> 00:38:32.960
<v ->Become part of the process.</v>

661
00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.960
What we're emphasizing, when I say we, I'm primarily

662
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.459
responsible for getting this together and a lot of people

663
00:38:41.459 --> 00:38:43.699
have made contributions to the book in their own personal

664
00:38:43.699 --> 00:38:46.780
cases and so forth, but I have to take responsibility

665
00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.259
for the final product of the book because, you know,

666
00:38:49.259 --> 00:38:53.200
I edited the final version and so on.

667
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:58.200
But what I and people who are buying into this sort of

668
00:38:59.159 --> 00:39:03.479
approach, I think what we're inviting people to do is to

669
00:39:03.479 --> 00:39:07.139
take this as an individual self-discovery project.

670
00:39:07.139 --> 00:39:10.059
It doesn't matter that you don't know that you might

671
00:39:10.059 --> 00:39:12.339
have a connection with a particular past lifetime,

672
00:39:12.339 --> 00:39:13.999
that will come later on.

673
00:39:13.999 --> 00:39:16.039
Because what you do is you begin to look at yourself

674
00:39:16.039 --> 00:39:17.540
in a different way.

675
00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:22.299
You begin to say how am I thinking about these issues

676
00:39:22.299 --> 00:39:23.519
that I'm facing?

677
00:39:23.519 --> 00:39:25.559
What approach am I bringing?

678
00:39:25.559 --> 00:39:29.099
How do I normally react to stress and challenge?

679
00:39:29.099 --> 00:39:31.899
What is my emotional stance?

680
00:39:31.899 --> 00:39:36.399
If I haven't changed it much in this lifetime, that must

681
00:39:36.399 --> 00:39:38.579
be the legacy I've brought forward,

682
00:39:38.579 --> 00:39:40.739
which is pretty deeply rooted.

683
00:39:40.739 --> 00:39:43.059
And if I'm going to make some changes, I've got to

684
00:39:43.059 --> 00:39:47.699
do something that requires serious work and involvement.

685
00:39:47.699 --> 00:39:48.059
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

686
00:39:48.059 --> 00:39:49.639
<v ->There's no magic bullet for this.</v>

687
00:39:49.639 --> 00:39:52.559
I mean, it's part of the evolution,

688
00:39:52.559 --> 00:39:54.579
when we talk about the evolution and my dear friend

689
00:39:54.579 --> 00:39:59.119
Barbara Marx Hubbard and I, she is way off out there

690
00:39:59.119 --> 00:40:02.400
in the future looking at things at a general level.

691
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.640
And I'm here saying, we've got to look at conscious

692
00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.039
evolution on a today level.

693
00:40:08.039 --> 00:40:09.619
We're involved in its individuals and

694
00:40:09.619 --> 00:40:11.799
we compliment each other.

695
00:40:11.799 --> 00:40:14.719
So when we have these conversations, it's wonderful

696
00:40:14.719 --> 00:40:19.719
because she's showing the potential that's out there

697
00:40:19.739 --> 00:40:21.539
and I'm saying, yes.

698
00:40:21.539 --> 00:40:24.280
And let's do our job today and do our homework

699
00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:29.280
and do our self work today, so that future will evolve.

700
00:40:29.939 --> 00:40:34.780
It won't evolve unless we begin to take this responsibility.

701
00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:39.780
And that's why I left the supernatural religions and the

702
00:40:40.039 --> 00:40:45.039
theology of western religions early on in my intellectual

703
00:40:45.519 --> 00:40:50.179
and psychological development because it absolved

704
00:40:50.179 --> 00:40:54.899
people of responsibility for who they really were.

705
00:40:54.899 --> 00:40:59.240
Now, many theologians from that perspective will disagree.

706
00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:03.717
They say, oh, no. We teach and preach responsibility,

707
00:41:03.717 --> 00:41:06.937
social responsibility, and love thy neighbor and

708
00:41:06.937 --> 00:41:11.677
all of these behavioral admonitions.

709
00:41:11.677 --> 00:41:16.677
But those are only admonitions and the driving force

710
00:41:16.877 --> 00:41:20.917
is not really to do those things, it's to fix your vision

711
00:41:20.917 --> 00:41:25.917
on that projected afterlife, which you know if you believe

712
00:41:26.597 --> 00:41:28.657
in that supernatural way of belief.

713
00:41:28.657 --> 00:41:33.477
Whether you are an Islamic suicide bomber or you are

714
00:41:33.477 --> 00:41:38.477
a Christian zealot, the same dynamic is at work

715
00:41:39.837 --> 00:41:43.837
because you know that what you're doing is going to be

716
00:41:43.837 --> 00:41:47.677
all right in the end because you have done it in the name

717
00:41:47.677 --> 00:41:51.577
of your particular religious belief system.

718
00:41:51.577 --> 00:41:56.577
What that does, even those who preach liberation theology

719
00:41:56.957 --> 00:42:01.277
and social conscious Christianity and those kinds of

720
00:42:01.277 --> 00:42:06.277
systems of thought, if they look a little more deeply,

721
00:42:06.597 --> 00:42:09.517
they will realize that the underbelly of their

722
00:42:09.517 --> 00:42:13.437
belief systems lies elsewhere.

723
00:42:13.437 --> 00:42:18.417
And lies in salvation being at another level than ones

724
00:42:18.417 --> 00:42:23.137
own actions and own behavior and self-responsibility.

725
00:42:23.137 --> 00:42:25.435
And it's sort of ironic because when you read some of the

726
00:42:25.435 --> 00:42:29.075
words that are attributed to Jesus, we're not quite sure

727
00:42:29.075 --> 00:42:31.955
what he said, but some that are attributed to him

728
00:42:31.955 --> 00:42:34.735
are exactly what I'm saying now.

729
00:42:34.735 --> 00:42:36.655
You know, heaven is within you.

730
00:42:36.655 --> 00:42:40.915
You change yourself, you take the responsibliity

731
00:42:40.915 --> 00:42:44.153
and you're responsible.

732
00:42:44.153 --> 00:42:45.653
<v Woman>Absolutely.</v>

733
00:42:45.653 --> 00:42:47.293
<v ->I'm not responsible.</v>

734
00:42:47.293 --> 00:42:51.753
The creator is not responsible.

735
00:42:51.753 --> 00:42:52.873
It's in your hands.

736
00:42:52.873 --> 00:42:56.453
But what's happened over the last 2000 years in Judeaism

737
00:42:56.453 --> 00:42:59.953
and Christianity and Islam and Mormonism and a lot

738
00:42:59.953 --> 00:43:03.733
of other new age cults that are very supernaturalistic

739
00:43:03.733 --> 00:43:06.793
in their orientation because they place the power

740
00:43:06.793 --> 00:43:11.753
at this divine, elevated level.

741
00:43:11.753 --> 00:43:15.073
I think we got a good bit of good advice from other beings.

742
00:43:15.073 --> 00:43:16.793
In one of my earlier books, as you might know

743
00:43:16.793 --> 00:43:18.233
"Gods, Genes and Consciousness"

744
00:43:18.233 --> 00:43:20.033
I talked about these advanced beings.

745
00:43:20.033 --> 00:43:22.773
We do get good advice from other sources.

746
00:43:22.773 --> 00:43:24.113
<v Woman>Too bad we don't follow it.</v>

747
00:43:24.113 --> 00:43:25.853
<v ->Well, it's too bad that we don't follow it because</v>

748
00:43:25.853 --> 00:43:28.093
what we do is we take their good advice, and I've been

749
00:43:28.093 --> 00:43:29.993
in some groups, and I'm in some right now

750
00:43:29.993 --> 00:43:32.993
who are receiving messages from various masters

751
00:43:32.993 --> 00:43:35.233
and various advanced beings.

752
00:43:35.233 --> 00:43:39.511
And what happens is they all generally say,

753
00:43:39.511 --> 00:43:41.471
I'm giving you this information and

754
00:43:41.471 --> 00:43:43.221
you've got to do something about it.

755
00:43:43.221 --> 00:43:46.625
But what the human reaction is, oh, I am blessed

756
00:43:46.625 --> 00:43:48.205
to have this information.

757
00:43:48.205 --> 00:43:50.163
I'm getting the attention of this advanced being

758
00:43:50.163 --> 00:43:52.363
and therefore I must be chosen.

759
00:43:52.363 --> 00:43:54.583
Therefore I must be, by definition doing the right

760
00:43:54.583 --> 00:43:56.563
thing the way I am, so I don't have to change.

761
00:43:56.563 --> 00:43:58.043
(laughs)

762
00:43:58.043 --> 00:43:59.563
You see what I mean?

763
00:43:59.563 --> 00:44:00.193
<v Woman>Yes, I do.</v>

764
00:44:00.193 --> 00:44:05.193
<v ->And what people don't realize is that buying into that</v>

765
00:44:07.019 --> 00:44:11.519
notion that you are already somehow part of that special

766
00:44:11.519 --> 00:44:16.519
group and therefore you are already chosen,

767
00:44:16.539 --> 00:44:18.659
like the early Presbyterians said we are all,

768
00:44:18.659 --> 00:44:21.500
in this church, the select.

769
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:24.339
We have been selected by God to be in this group.

770
00:44:24.339 --> 00:44:27.079
So this group who's receiving channel material from

771
00:44:27.079 --> 00:44:32.079
some AB name Mr. X or Ms. Y or they X, Y, Z, a group

772
00:44:35.399 --> 00:44:39.219
of spirit guides because we have been chosen and

773
00:44:39.219 --> 00:44:43.359
picked out by them, that means we're on the right track.

774
00:44:43.359 --> 00:44:48.359
And that causes us not to question our own assumptions,

775
00:44:49.839 --> 00:44:54.079
our own choices and saying what are we

776
00:44:54.079 --> 00:44:56.659
doing in this picture?

777
00:44:56.659 --> 00:44:58.579
What contribution are we making?

778
00:44:58.579 --> 00:45:00.539
What role are we playing?

779
00:45:00.539 --> 00:45:04.199
Unless you get to that level as an individual, going back

780
00:45:04.199 --> 00:45:08.179
to Chris Argyris' learning theory at the graduate school

781
00:45:08.179 --> 00:45:10.119
of education at Harvard.

782
00:45:10.119 --> 00:45:13.759
Unless you face up to the fact that the assumptions that

783
00:45:13.759 --> 00:45:17.099
you've been living with about the nature of reality

784
00:45:17.099 --> 00:45:22.099
don't quite measure up, you're not going to change.

785
00:45:22.937 --> 00:45:25.137
Sorry, I got on my sermon mode there.

786
00:45:25.137 --> 00:45:28.397
<v Woman>It's very, no. Very true words.</v>

787
00:45:28.397 --> 00:45:32.157
And, again, people can join in this experiment

788
00:45:32.157 --> 00:45:34.117
through the website.

789
00:45:34.117 --> 00:45:37.017
Also the book, I like a lot of the visuals you have because

790
00:45:37.017 --> 00:45:38.277
this really drives it home.

791
00:45:38.277 --> 00:45:39.553
Some of the cases you were just talking about.

792
00:45:39.553 --> 00:45:40.073
<v ->Right.</v>

793
00:45:40.073 --> 00:45:42.593
<v Woman>Looking at the biometrics of the face overlays</v>

794
00:45:42.593 --> 00:45:44.993
is quite interesting and that's a scientific case

795
00:45:44.993 --> 00:45:46.333
for reincarnation.

796
00:45:46.333 --> 00:45:48.733
Very important work that you're doing at this time.

797
00:45:48.733 --> 00:45:51.973
Self-responsibility, I'm with you, that's where it's at.

798
00:45:51.973 --> 00:45:53.813
So thank you so much for your time.

799
00:45:53.813 --> 00:45:56.213
<v ->It's a pleasure. Thank you for listening.</v>

800
00:45:57.791 --> 00:46:00.451
<v ->If you've had some strong suspicious about your own</v>

801
00:46:00.451 --> 00:46:03.051
past or that of another, please contact Paul at

802
00:46:03.051 --> 00:46:05.451
reincarnationexperiment.org.

803
00:46:05.451 --> 00:46:08.031
This is an ongoing project that is approached in a

804
00:46:08.031 --> 00:46:10.971
rigorous, scientific manner and may provide clues

805
00:46:10.971 --> 00:46:13.591
as to some of your long unanswered questions.

806
00:46:13.591 --> 00:46:16.051
For more on Paul's work, pick up a copy of his book,

807
00:46:16.051 --> 00:46:17.611
"The Soul Genome."

808
00:46:17.611 --> 00:46:20.271
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
