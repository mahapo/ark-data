1
00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:02.728
<v ->When most of us become ill, we either</v>

2
00:00:02.728 --> 00:00:05.409
blame our bodies or others for our plight.

3
00:00:05.409 --> 00:00:07.309
But Peter Fairfield says that illness

4
00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:09.690
is an invitation to make friends with our bodies

5
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.350
and that there are spiritual benefits to illness.

6
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.509
Though Peter had profound questions

7
00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.990
around the nature of reality from a very early age,

8
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.789
his path to greater understanding of the healing process

9
00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.970
began when, by a series of serendipitous events,

10
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.589
Peter was invited to study under the protective wing

11
00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.063
of a high order lama in Nepal.

12
00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:33.083
(calming music)

13
00:00:37.373 --> 00:00:40.150
Your journey started as a child,

14
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.690
your experiences with, as I understand,

15
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.610
healing with your hands but not knowing

16
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.104
that's what you were doing?

17
00:00:46.104 --> 00:00:47.885
<v ->It actually started a little before that.</v>

18
00:00:47.885 --> 00:00:50.285
Somebody told me about the idea of infinity.

19
00:00:50.285 --> 00:00:51.684
I couldn't figure that out.

20
00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.824
Something never began, never end.

21
00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:55.524
I thought about that.

22
00:00:55.524 --> 00:00:57.060
Then one day I decided I was gonna try to go

23
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.880
where that place was, and I had no context.

24
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.840
My friends, I couldn't talk to them about it.

25
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.921
I didn't even know this was an odd thing,

26
00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:05.740
so I would occasionally close my eyes

27
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.380
and try to go someplace that never began or ended.

28
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.041
I don't really know how long it took,

29
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:13.820
but after some months, one day I got there,

30
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.140
and I went "Oh, is that what that is?"

31
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.700
And then I kind of forgot about it,

32
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.221
but somehow that experience of infinity,

33
00:01:21.221 --> 00:01:23.903
of, what I later would describe as non-duality,

34
00:01:23.903 --> 00:01:26.983
kind of dropped into me and became a part of me,

35
00:01:26.983 --> 00:01:28.983
and whenever I would see that word infinity,

36
00:01:28.983 --> 00:01:31.343
or I would get this concept of something that was just

37
00:01:31.343 --> 00:01:33.622
endless, and infinite, and good at the same time,

38
00:01:33.622 --> 00:01:35.803
I would know that there was something for me.

39
00:01:35.803 --> 00:01:37.362
Shortly after that, whenever I would see somebody

40
00:01:37.362 --> 00:01:39.602
in pain, or hurting, or uncomfortable,

41
00:01:39.602 --> 00:01:41.322
I would just want to put my hands on them.

42
00:01:41.322 --> 00:01:43.562
I didn't realize that this was some kind of healing.

43
00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:45.901
And, quite a few times, they felt a lot better.

44
00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:47.641
And it didn't even dawn on me that I was

45
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:49.661
actually doing anything other than just offering--

46
00:01:49.661 --> 00:01:50.691
<v ->Being nice.</v>

47
00:01:50.691 --> 00:01:52.340
<v ->care and assistance.</v>

48
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.441
And, of course, I went through the playing doctor stage

49
00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:57.261
which was transformative in my interest in healing,

50
00:01:57.261 --> 00:01:58.580
but that's a whole other show, I think.

51
00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.380
<v ->(laughs) Right.</v>

52
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.960
<v ->Probably a different channel.</v>

53
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.720
So, I didn't really have any ideas

54
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.180
of what being a healer would be like

55
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.980
other than being like a regular medical doctor,

56
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.619
and that didn't seem interesting to me at all.

57
00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.420
And around 15, I started to realize that there was

58
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.219
something I was looking for.

59
00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:17.499
I'm sure many of your listeners have experienced

60
00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:19.499
that kind of gnawing sensation that

61
00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:21.639
something's missing, something important,

62
00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.339
something meaningful, something that is believable,

63
00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:26.659
and yet, transcendent, and we didn't even

64
00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.539
have that word at the time.

65
00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:31.059
So, I started to look in philosophy and it wasn't there,

66
00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:33.298
I looked in music, and it was sort of there,

67
00:02:33.298 --> 00:02:35.259
but it wasn't really there.

68
00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:37.459
I tried drug, sex, and rock and roll hoping

69
00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.449
that would be it, but it really wasn't it.

70
00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:40.728
<v ->But for moments at a time, perhaps?</v>

71
00:02:40.728 --> 00:02:42.919
<v ->A lot of good moments.</v>

72
00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:46.109
The late-sixties were fun, but in the midst of that,

73
00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.429
I began to discover Asia, Asian philosophy.

74
00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:51.069
My dad was actually born in China.

75
00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.349
My grandparents were missionaries there

76
00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.709
and started a college way back in 1910

77
00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.088
or something that's still going in China.

78
00:02:57.088 --> 00:02:59.068
So, I thought I was being rebellious,

79
00:02:59.068 --> 00:03:01.488
but really, it sort of fit the genetic momentum

80
00:03:01.488 --> 00:03:04.428
in a certain weird way, and then I began

81
00:03:04.428 --> 00:03:06.747
to learn meditation when I was 18.

82
00:03:06.747 --> 00:03:09.888
And we had to stop smoking marijuana

83
00:03:09.888 --> 00:03:12.667
to take the TM thing, which was big,

84
00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:14.408
so that was like a whole other dimension,

85
00:03:14.408 --> 00:03:17.188
but it was interesting, the guy that taught me my mantra

86
00:03:17.188 --> 00:03:20.848
had a blue blazer and a red tie, and I thought to myself,

87
00:03:20.848 --> 00:03:23.328
"Well, here I am. I'm taking the transition

88
00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:25.248
from this ancient wisdom from this

89
00:03:25.248 --> 00:03:28.647
very straight-looking guy in a preppy outfit."

90
00:03:28.647 --> 00:03:29.407
<v ->Right.</v>

91
00:03:29.407 --> 00:03:31.847
<v ->But, somehow, that lineage passed to me,</v>

92
00:03:31.847 --> 00:03:34.087
and I began to practice meditating,

93
00:03:34.087 --> 00:03:36.047
and although I wouldn't do it all the time--

94
00:03:36.047 --> 00:03:37.928
I would have years where I lived in ashrams

95
00:03:37.928 --> 00:03:39.687
and spiritual communities and then I'd come

96
00:03:39.687 --> 00:03:42.047
back out into the world, and I learned

97
00:03:42.047 --> 00:03:43.908
various kinds of healing.

98
00:03:43.908 --> 00:03:46.227
I began to study acupuncture in my early 20s,

99
00:03:46.227 --> 00:03:49.287
and it became very important to me.

100
00:03:49.287 --> 00:03:50.947
<v ->And you spent a good amount of time in Asia</v>

101
00:03:50.947 --> 00:03:53.267
studying, as you said, you alluded to a moment ago,

102
00:03:53.267 --> 00:03:54.687
many different healing modalities.

103
00:03:54.687 --> 00:03:56.107
Can you go a little bit more into your time

104
00:03:56.107 --> 00:03:57.746
in Tibet and Nepal?

105
00:03:57.746 --> 00:03:59.287
<v ->Okay, that actually came later.</v>

106
00:03:59.287 --> 00:04:01.926
I didn't really go there until I was 35.

107
00:04:01.926 --> 00:04:04.026
And one day I woke up and said,

108
00:04:04.026 --> 00:04:05.686
"You know, my family's been to Asia,

109
00:04:05.686 --> 00:04:07.666
I practice Asian medicine, I teach it.

110
00:04:07.666 --> 00:04:09.285
I have to go to China."

111
00:04:09.285 --> 00:04:12.046
<v ->Oh, maybe we should jump back a little bit, 20 to 35.</v>

112
00:04:12.046 --> 00:04:13.086
How did you--

113
00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:16.906
you said you became certified at that point in acupuncture

114
00:04:16.906 --> 00:04:18.062
which you'd been doing many years.

115
00:04:18.062 --> 00:04:20.642
<v ->Yes, I started doing healing in my early 20s,</v>

116
00:04:20.642 --> 00:04:22.742
and I did body work, I went to acupuncture school,

117
00:04:22.742 --> 00:04:25.102
I lived with a Taoist priest in the mountains

118
00:04:25.102 --> 00:04:28.042
of Malibu of all places, and was sort of immersed

119
00:04:28.042 --> 00:04:30.262
in learning energetic medicine and

120
00:04:30.262 --> 00:04:32.342
getting deeper into meditative experiences,

121
00:04:32.342 --> 00:04:34.922
and also beginning to trust perceptions

122
00:04:34.922 --> 00:04:37.681
that were sort of out of the material.

123
00:04:37.681 --> 00:04:42.081
So, that brought me to a strong interest in the physiology.

124
00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:44.779
What was happening in the Asian medical systems,

125
00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:46.779
because the West didn't really have good models.

126
00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:50.619
I'd worked in regular hospitals and psychiatric hospitals

127
00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:53.479
and regular hospitals and I just didn't see the people

128
00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.239
that really knew what they were talking about.

129
00:04:55.239 --> 00:04:57.539
They were getting medicines and administering care,

130
00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.999
but the people, their soul wasn't getting better,

131
00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.479
their hearts weren't opening.

132
00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.098
You know, perhaps some of the symptoms

133
00:05:03.098 --> 00:05:05.778
were being abated, but the essence of them

134
00:05:05.778 --> 00:05:07.198
as a person wasn't being brought out

135
00:05:07.198 --> 00:05:09.638
and I, somehow, had an intuition that

136
00:05:09.638 --> 00:05:11.678
that's what we needed to find.

137
00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:13.357
That's what interested me about Chinese medicine;

138
00:05:13.357 --> 00:05:17.018
it had a sense of the soul and the spirit of transcendence.

139
00:05:17.018 --> 00:05:18.966
This was sort of lost in mainland China

140
00:05:18.966 --> 00:05:20.638
because, in communism, the state evolves,

141
00:05:20.638 --> 00:05:22.079
the person doesn't.

142
00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:23.598
So, much of the magic and the transcendent

143
00:05:23.598 --> 00:05:26.237
part of Chinese medicine and that whole interaction

144
00:05:26.237 --> 00:05:29.718
between spiritual physiology and medical work

145
00:05:29.718 --> 00:05:33.108
got lost and became very Westernized.

146
00:05:33.108 --> 00:05:35.117
But there were lineages that were kept alive in China

147
00:05:35.117 --> 00:05:37.176
that I later got to study with and, of course,

148
00:05:37.176 --> 00:05:39.657
in Taiwan and also some in the United States

149
00:05:39.657 --> 00:05:42.516
were teaching in the California area at that time.

150
00:05:42.516 --> 00:05:43.897
<v ->And you were practicing acupuncture</v>

151
00:05:43.897 --> 00:05:46.276
during this entire journey, so to speak?

152
00:05:46.276 --> 00:05:50.087
<v ->I began practicing probably</v>

153
00:05:50.087 --> 00:05:52.906
in my mid to late 20s.

154
00:05:52.906 --> 00:05:54.276
I was actually practicing before I went

155
00:05:54.276 --> 00:05:55.376
to acupuncture school.

156
00:05:55.376 --> 00:05:57.216
I had worked at UCLA at the pain control unit,

157
00:05:57.216 --> 00:05:59.196
and I had been doing body work,

158
00:05:59.196 --> 00:06:01.316
and the guys there just go "Here's some needles.

159
00:06:01.316 --> 00:06:02.215
Go try it."

160
00:06:02.215 --> 00:06:03.854
So, they showed me how to do it,

161
00:06:03.854 --> 00:06:06.754
and I could already feel the points,

162
00:06:06.754 --> 00:06:08.654
and I could sense them and I could

163
00:06:08.654 --> 00:06:10.854
kind of feel the points that I wanted to do,

164
00:06:10.854 --> 00:06:12.674
and so I began to experiment myself,

165
00:06:12.674 --> 00:06:14.834
and I didn't die, I didn't spurt blood anywhere.

166
00:06:14.834 --> 00:06:17.075
So, I began to try it on selected patients that

167
00:06:17.075 --> 00:06:19.474
they knew that I didn't really know that,

168
00:06:19.474 --> 00:06:21.774
and I started to see some miraculous results.

169
00:06:21.774 --> 00:06:23.754
It was easier, quicker.

170
00:06:23.754 --> 00:06:25.394
My hands didn't ache when I got up in the morning,

171
00:06:25.394 --> 00:06:26.573
because sometimes we'd do very long

172
00:06:26.573 --> 00:06:27.773
body work sessions.

173
00:06:27.773 --> 00:06:29.929
So, I saw there was something here.

174
00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:32.889
And they had a very rich theoretical tradition

175
00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:34.450
that, again, brought in the spiritual

176
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.689
and where the spiritual met the physical

177
00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:38.649
through the aspect of physiology.

178
00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:40.749
That was very important to me.

179
00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:43.330
<v ->So, at what point did you--</v>

180
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.729
you say you were 35 years old when you

181
00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:48.789
finally decided to go and live throughout Asia for a while.

182
00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:50.567
Can we talk about that part of your journey

183
00:06:50.567 --> 00:06:51.885
and your discoveries?

184
00:06:51.885 --> 00:06:52.785
<v ->Yeah, it was interesting.</v>

185
00:06:52.785 --> 00:06:54.265
I decided to go to Asia.

186
00:06:54.265 --> 00:06:56.346
I was practicing up in the wine country in Sonoma,

187
00:06:56.346 --> 00:06:57.884
gave up my practice, then I went to Monterey

188
00:06:57.884 --> 00:06:59.781
for the summer to study Chinese,

189
00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:01.361
and I'd been interested in Tibetan things,

190
00:07:01.361 --> 00:07:02.929
I'd done retreats and studied with teachers,

191
00:07:02.929 --> 00:07:04.084
but I never made a commitment.

192
00:07:04.084 --> 00:07:05.883
And I'd either sold or given everything away,

193
00:07:05.883 --> 00:07:07.324
or put a few things in storage,

194
00:07:07.324 --> 00:07:08.281
and in this house I rented,

195
00:07:08.281 --> 00:07:10.422
there was a stack of books on Tibetan Buddhism.

196
00:07:10.422 --> 00:07:12.801
So, I would study Chinese eight, ten hours a day,

197
00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:14.881
and just for relief, I would start reading these books

198
00:07:14.881 --> 00:07:16.621
on Tibetan Buddhism.

199
00:07:16.621 --> 00:07:18.781
It was a very rarified situation for me.

200
00:07:18.781 --> 00:07:20.761
I found myself making prayers,

201
00:07:20.761 --> 00:07:23.061
just take me to the next level, wherever it is.

202
00:07:23.061 --> 00:07:25.920
And one day I was meditating, and I saw a face.

203
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.300
A face appeared to me.

204
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.241
And turned sideways and disappeared.

205
00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:30.739
The next day I got a letter saying

206
00:07:30.739 --> 00:07:33.499
all my plans to go to Shanghai were up in the air,

207
00:07:33.499 --> 00:07:35.639
so I decided I'd go to Taiwan.

208
00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:37.298
I went to Taiwan, my first day there,

209
00:07:37.298 --> 00:07:38.898
I got up, went to the Palace Museum,

210
00:07:38.898 --> 00:07:40.778
and two Tibetan lamas walked down the stairs

211
00:07:40.778 --> 00:07:43.079
just as I exited the taxi.

212
00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:44.519
I didn't even know who they were,

213
00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:46.578
but they put this bug in me, I got to find some lamas.

214
00:07:46.578 --> 00:07:49.076
So, about six weeks later, I was in Kaohsiung,

215
00:07:49.076 --> 00:07:51.097
Southern Taiwan, and I got a call from

216
00:07:51.097 --> 00:07:53.677
this old Chinese lama that had studied

217
00:07:53.677 --> 00:07:55.157
in Tibet for many years.

218
00:07:55.157 --> 00:07:58.737
"You want to meet some lamas? I'll be at your house.

219
00:07:58.737 --> 00:08:00.516
Where do you live? Oh."

220
00:08:00.516 --> 00:08:02.456
Five minutes later, he pulled up in a taxi

221
00:08:02.456 --> 00:08:03.816
in front of this place I was staying,

222
00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:05.576
took me two blocks away.

223
00:08:05.576 --> 00:08:07.697
When I walked in the house, and in Taiwan

224
00:08:07.697 --> 00:08:10.077
the first floor is kind of like a garage,

225
00:08:10.077 --> 00:08:13.217
there was a picture on a desk and I thought,

226
00:08:13.217 --> 00:08:15.237
"Wow. That looks like the face I saw."

227
00:08:15.237 --> 00:08:16.778
But it had glasses and a ceremonial headdress.

228
00:08:16.778 --> 00:08:18.508
and I said, "No, no, no. They all look alike."

229
00:08:18.508 --> 00:08:19.968
I just didn't want to go there.

230
00:08:19.968 --> 00:08:21.388
But we went upstairs, we went into the room

231
00:08:21.388 --> 00:08:23.049
where one of these lamas from Nepal was,

232
00:08:23.049 --> 00:08:25.408
a Tibetan lama, and on the table was the exact face

233
00:08:25.408 --> 00:08:27.188
that I had seen in this vision.

234
00:08:27.188 --> 00:08:28.948
Well, I had already set up this thing to study

235
00:08:28.948 --> 00:08:31.048
at the brand new Chinese medical hospital

236
00:08:31.048 --> 00:08:32.928
in Kaohsiung, I'd been on Chinese television,

237
00:08:32.928 --> 00:08:34.748
and he said, "Oh."

238
00:08:34.748 --> 00:08:36.009
I said, "I know this person."

239
00:08:36.009 --> 00:08:37.848
And he said well do you want to come with us,

240
00:08:37.848 --> 00:08:39.308
so I said okay.

241
00:08:39.308 --> 00:08:41.368
'Cause I knew that if I didn't go, I'd always wonder.

242
00:08:41.368 --> 00:08:43.128
So, ten days later with a plane full of

243
00:08:43.128 --> 00:08:47.308
Taiwanese Tibetan tourists, that all knew the story,

244
00:08:47.308 --> 00:08:50.688
we went to Nepal, and I met my teacher

245
00:08:50.688 --> 00:08:52.929
with all them kind of looking over,

246
00:08:52.929 --> 00:08:55.468
and that was the beginning of that,

247
00:08:55.468 --> 00:08:57.026
and he turned out to be

248
00:08:57.026 --> 00:09:00.743
a profoundly accomplished lama.

249
00:09:00.743 --> 00:09:03.403
He had done over 40 years of solitary retreat.

250
00:09:03.403 --> 00:09:05.643
He'd never accepted a Westerner before,

251
00:09:05.643 --> 00:09:06.903
and he gave me a room next to his

252
00:09:06.903 --> 00:09:08.883
in this small little monastery that he had,

253
00:09:08.883 --> 00:09:10.423
even though he was a very high lama.

254
00:09:10.423 --> 00:09:13.923
And so, that was the beginning.

255
00:09:13.923 --> 00:09:16.724
And about three weeks later, I finally said

256
00:09:16.724 --> 00:09:18.818
well, Rinpoche, how about some teachings?

257
00:09:18.818 --> 00:09:21.098
So, finally he said okay.

258
00:09:21.098 --> 00:09:23.236
So, I went there and I got this transmission,

259
00:09:23.236 --> 00:09:24.977
and at the end, I was really in my ego

260
00:09:24.977 --> 00:09:27.757
and really in my head 'cause I had seen this teacher

261
00:09:27.757 --> 00:09:30.930
in a dream, and I said, "Rinpoche,

262
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:32.171
I'm kind of an advanced meditator,

263
00:09:32.171 --> 00:09:33.710
how about something really advanced

264
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.630
'cause I know I'm ready for that."

265
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:38.470
My private parts cringe as I say this today.

266
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.870
So, he turned away for a moment, and he said,

267
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.130
"Well, what is the nature of mind?"

268
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.211
And I thought to myself, "Oh, I know that."

269
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:47.151
But you don't know the nature of mind, you know?

270
00:09:47.151 --> 00:09:48.529
So, when I turned back he had no head.

271
00:09:48.529 --> 00:09:51.169
There was this big black hole where his head was.

272
00:09:51.169 --> 00:09:53.269
And that was the beginning of my training.

273
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:54.548
<v ->I bet.</v>

274
00:09:54.548 --> 00:09:56.108
<v ->That was the beginning of my realization</v>

275
00:09:56.108 --> 00:09:59.508
of where you can go and where I wasn't.

276
00:09:59.508 --> 00:10:01.969
And once you establish that,

277
00:10:01.969 --> 00:10:03.227
then your ability to heal changes

278
00:10:03.227 --> 00:10:05.787
because you're not healing from myself as Peter.

279
00:10:05.787 --> 00:10:07.646
You began to realize that there's this

280
00:10:07.646 --> 00:10:09.765
whole transcendent world that's beyond

281
00:10:09.765 --> 00:10:12.385
our conceptual mind, beyond what we thought.

282
00:10:12.385 --> 00:10:13.825
Now I had done energy work before

283
00:10:13.825 --> 00:10:15.865
and I'd had intuitions about things,

284
00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:18.185
but this was different.

285
00:10:18.185 --> 00:10:20.986
And so, for the next two years, I treated most

286
00:10:20.986 --> 00:10:23.975
of the high lamas in the Nyingma and Kagyu tradition.

287
00:10:23.975 --> 00:10:27.214
And this was profound experience that

288
00:10:27.214 --> 00:10:29.374
I didn't really even understand at the time.

289
00:10:29.374 --> 00:10:31.955
In Chinese medicine when you take the pulse,

290
00:10:31.955 --> 00:10:33.554
you can feel what's going on.

291
00:10:33.554 --> 00:10:35.014
In simplest, you can feel the organs

292
00:10:35.014 --> 00:10:36.274
and you learn to feel the emotions,

293
00:10:36.274 --> 00:10:37.854
and then you can begin to feel the karmic

294
00:10:37.854 --> 00:10:40.454
predicament as your view gets bigger.

295
00:10:40.454 --> 00:10:42.634
When I first took my teacher's pulse,

296
00:10:42.634 --> 00:10:45.632
there was a quality that I couldn't even get at all.

297
00:10:45.632 --> 00:10:48.833
I couldn't even relate to it, and I thought

298
00:10:48.833 --> 00:10:50.172
I was good at the pulse.

299
00:10:50.172 --> 00:10:51.550
And over the next 10 years, I would feel

300
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.890
that quality in various lamas' pulses--

301
00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.188
I'm gonna skip ahead but then

302
00:10:55.188 --> 00:10:56.587
I'll come back and tie it together.

303
00:10:56.587 --> 00:10:58.886
And about 10, 12 years later,

304
00:10:58.886 --> 00:11:00.286
there was this great lama that had come

305
00:11:00.286 --> 00:11:02.266
to the San Francisco area to teach,

306
00:11:02.266 --> 00:11:03.645
and he just filled the whole room with light.

307
00:11:03.645 --> 00:11:05.184
The translator had no idea what he said,

308
00:11:05.184 --> 00:11:07.604
but everybody just got zapped in this altered state.

309
00:11:07.604 --> 00:11:10.504
And I went to his house, and he said,

310
00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:11.603
"You're my student."

311
00:11:11.603 --> 00:11:12.960
And he put his hand on me and just this

312
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.480
streaming energy went through my body

313
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.181
and he said, "Here, take my pulse."

314
00:11:16.181 --> 00:11:20.000
And I took his pulse, and I understood enlightenment.

315
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.980
All the teachings came into line,

316
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.461
I understood the momentum and what it meant,

317
00:11:24.461 --> 00:11:26.280
I understood that, from the inside out,

318
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.141
that we all are enlightened, and it's the

319
00:11:28.141 --> 00:11:30.921
occlusion of our concepts, the occlusion of our fears

320
00:11:30.921 --> 00:11:35.080
and desires, and familial momentum of our family,

321
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.960
and all the contextual stuff from our culture,

322
00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.540
that that occluded it.

323
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.340
But there was this fundamental place of being,

324
00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.900
and everything I've done really from that moment,

325
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.641
is to reengineer what healing was

326
00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:49.561
based on the model of enlightenment,

327
00:11:49.561 --> 00:11:51.841
based on the model of purity of being,

328
00:11:51.841 --> 00:11:53.620
that we're trying to let come through

329
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.521
that there is nothing to get, nothing to have,

330
00:11:55.521 --> 00:11:56.781
nothing to do.

331
00:11:56.781 --> 00:11:59.581
It's just allow this to be experienced through it.

332
00:11:59.581 --> 00:12:03.401
So, that's really, since then, I've worked to integrate

333
00:12:03.401 --> 00:12:06.121
what that meant, to bring that through and,

334
00:12:06.121 --> 00:12:08.440
from the time I met my teacher to that time,

335
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.501
I had studied in China with Taoists,

336
00:12:10.501 --> 00:12:12.541
and done retreats, and done long retreats

337
00:12:12.541 --> 00:12:14.580
in the Himalayas, both in Tibet and up

338
00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:15.901
just south of Mount Everest up in

339
00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:20.461
a little cabin just south of Lukla, kind of all alone,

340
00:12:20.461 --> 00:12:22.321
which was some of the most profound

341
00:12:22.321 --> 00:12:24.101
and, in a way, happiest times of my life,

342
00:12:24.101 --> 00:12:26.121
because it's just pure experience of being,

343
00:12:26.121 --> 00:12:28.479
nothing's pulling you away from that.

344
00:12:28.479 --> 00:12:31.120
So, when I do healing now, it's that sense of

345
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.620
that timeless quality of infinity that I got

346
00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.780
when I was a little boy, that sense of what

347
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.900
enlightenment was from the pulse of this lama,

348
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.900
the energy that I realized that I had gotten

349
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.000
through the whole time from all these great teachers.

350
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.180
Me as a fly on the wall, trying to help them

351
00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.400
through simple physical things when they were really,

352
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.249
many of them were really at an incredibly

353
00:12:50.249 --> 00:12:52.170
high level of accomplishment.

354
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:56.009
So, it was a very amazing opportunity for me.

355
00:12:56.009 --> 00:12:57.750
<v ->What a story.</v>

356
00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:58.889
And it's real.

357
00:12:58.889 --> 00:12:59.969
<v ->And it's real.</v>

358
00:12:59.969 --> 00:13:01.614
<v ->Not fictionalized.</v>

359
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:06.179
Would this be an appropriate time--

360
00:13:06.179 --> 00:13:10.109
let me ask you to jump into the specific subject

361
00:13:10.109 --> 00:13:13.017
that I want to talk to you about, which is

362
00:13:13.017 --> 00:13:14.617
the spiritual benefits of illness

363
00:13:14.617 --> 00:13:15.957
which you're talking about--

364
00:13:15.957 --> 00:13:18.158
<v ->Well, it's a funny title because</v>

365
00:13:18.158 --> 00:13:19.517
they actually made me call it--

366
00:13:19.517 --> 00:13:22.407
but, that's what the truth is.

367
00:13:22.407 --> 00:13:23.845
And I've worked in hospitals for years,

368
00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:26.385
I probably treated 60 or 70 thousand people

369
00:13:26.385 --> 00:13:29.365
as an acupuncturist and healer in various ways.

370
00:13:29.365 --> 00:13:31.863
And in the end, it just becomes pattern recognition.

371
00:13:31.863 --> 00:13:34.003
But what you see, is that most of the things

372
00:13:34.003 --> 00:13:38.763
that we call disease is the body trying to get better.

373
00:13:38.763 --> 00:13:40.824
Fever: body's trying to get better.

374
00:13:40.824 --> 00:13:42.364
Pain: it's a message.

375
00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:45.583
Vomiting, pooping, things coming out.

376
00:13:45.583 --> 00:13:50.083
Hysteria, spasm, all these things are a sign

377
00:13:50.083 --> 00:13:51.643
that the body is trying to move from

378
00:13:51.643 --> 00:13:54.183
a stuck state to an unstuck state,

379
00:13:54.183 --> 00:13:55.763
where this enlightened energy is saying

380
00:13:55.763 --> 00:13:57.103
hey, we're alive.

381
00:13:57.103 --> 00:13:58.983
We don't need to be conceptually contained

382
00:13:58.983 --> 00:14:02.443
within the hallmarks of suppressed physiology,

383
00:14:02.443 --> 00:14:05.303
but really we can live, and most of the things

384
00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:09.063
that we call disease, are actually that process.

385
00:14:09.063 --> 00:14:10.443
So, we've turned it around.

386
00:14:10.443 --> 00:14:12.302
That's why I like to come from the enlightenment model,

387
00:14:12.302 --> 00:14:15.141
because there is a sense all of us have this Buddha nature,

388
00:14:15.141 --> 00:14:16.821
all of us have this Christ consciousness,

389
00:14:16.821 --> 00:14:19.001
it's innate, it's the basis of life,

390
00:14:19.001 --> 00:14:20.722
that is what I experienced in that

391
00:14:20.722 --> 00:14:22.542
moment of infinity at eight or nine,

392
00:14:22.542 --> 00:14:24.541
that is what I experienced in the pulse.

393
00:14:24.541 --> 00:14:26.221
And when we all take a deep breath,

394
00:14:26.221 --> 00:14:29.021
after we have sex, after we're too tired to fight it,

395
00:14:29.021 --> 00:14:30.622
there's a moment of clarity and, all of a sudden,

396
00:14:30.622 --> 00:14:32.501
everything let's go and we experience

397
00:14:32.501 --> 00:14:33.941
that infinity of being.

398
00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:36.341
Seeing something beautiful, loving our child,

399
00:14:36.341 --> 00:14:39.381
feeling totally safe for a moment,

400
00:14:39.381 --> 00:14:41.781
this non-duality of infinite being that's

401
00:14:41.781 --> 00:14:46.322
love and pleasure, but without attachment, exists.

402
00:14:46.322 --> 00:14:49.688
If you can walk and breathe, you have that inside you.

403
00:14:51.418 --> 00:14:53.178
<v ->What happens when a person receives,</v>

404
00:14:53.178 --> 00:14:56.779
in the Western model, versus the Eastern model,

405
00:14:56.779 --> 00:14:59.218
when a person receives the news that there's

406
00:14:59.218 --> 00:15:01.358
something in their body that is potentially

407
00:15:01.358 --> 00:15:02.718
life-threatening.

408
00:15:02.718 --> 00:15:04.538
<v ->First thing, we go to fear.</v>

409
00:15:04.538 --> 00:15:07.978
We go to fear, we switch from a relaxed mode

410
00:15:07.978 --> 00:15:10.198
to sympathetic mode, which means survival.

411
00:15:10.198 --> 00:15:11.558
Energy goes in the head, arms and legs,

412
00:15:11.558 --> 00:15:14.318
it stops the healing mode, it stops the whole sense

413
00:15:14.318 --> 00:15:16.218
of the immune system from functioning,

414
00:15:16.218 --> 00:15:18.718
it's the opposite of where we want to go.

415
00:15:18.718 --> 00:15:20.018
In Chinese medicine, we study the organs,

416
00:15:20.018 --> 00:15:22.238
we see each of the organs has a personality.

417
00:15:22.238 --> 00:15:24.938
Like the heart really has to do with the spirit.

418
00:15:24.938 --> 00:15:29.138
If you talk about the physiology of enlightenment,

419
00:15:29.138 --> 00:15:33.258
and again, enlightenment is a non-linear quantum feel

420
00:15:33.258 --> 00:15:34.899
that all things exist, but I'm gonna talk about

421
00:15:34.899 --> 00:15:37.318
in a very linear way, just a piece of it,

422
00:15:37.318 --> 00:15:39.578
so you get an idea of how this progression goes.

423
00:15:39.578 --> 00:15:42.338
But if you look at the energy system, the chakras

424
00:15:42.338 --> 00:15:43.938
and how that moves into the heart,

425
00:15:43.938 --> 00:15:45.656
what we find is there's an infinite realm

426
00:15:45.656 --> 00:15:47.476
of frequencies that come down through

427
00:15:47.476 --> 00:15:49.136
the crown chakra, through the central channel,

428
00:15:49.136 --> 00:15:50.656
comes into the heart.

429
00:15:50.656 --> 00:15:52.476
Into the heart, there are two little electrical nodes

430
00:15:52.476 --> 00:15:55.316
that vibrate and homeopathically imprint

431
00:15:55.316 --> 00:15:57.856
the nature of our soul's experience onto the blood

432
00:15:57.856 --> 00:15:59.956
and that gets taken through the body.

433
00:15:59.956 --> 00:16:02.134
We have another part in the lower abdomen

434
00:16:02.134 --> 00:16:03.434
called the dantian.

435
00:16:03.434 --> 00:16:05.454
It's an energy transformative process,

436
00:16:05.454 --> 00:16:07.794
part of the Asian system, and the momentum

437
00:16:07.794 --> 00:16:10.654
of our ancestor's gets carried through the kidneys,

438
00:16:10.654 --> 00:16:12.734
into the central channel it kind of comes up.

439
00:16:12.734 --> 00:16:15.934
So, the wisdom of our ancestors on the earth plane

440
00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:18.449
meets the wisdom of our spiritual heritage

441
00:16:18.449 --> 00:16:20.789
that comes down and they meet in the central channel,

442
00:16:20.789 --> 00:16:22.675
the Sushumna, Chong Mai, depending on

443
00:16:22.675 --> 00:16:24.234
what system you're talking about.

444
00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:26.094
So, you have this sense of momentum.

445
00:16:26.094 --> 00:16:27.774
So, you take someone with heart disease,

446
00:16:27.774 --> 00:16:29.814
when we deny our heart, we deny our love,

447
00:16:29.814 --> 00:16:31.434
we deny our spiritual history,

448
00:16:31.434 --> 00:16:34.293
when we deny what we know is true,

449
00:16:34.293 --> 00:16:36.213
and proper microphone functioning,

450
00:16:36.213 --> 00:16:38.734
is keeping my hands away from my chest here.

451
00:16:38.734 --> 00:16:40.473
<v ->Little tap there.
<v ->Thanks for reminding me.</v>

452
00:16:40.473 --> 00:16:42.490
What we find is people that deny that

453
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.450
have heart disease.

454
00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:47.050
People that are so mental--

455
00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:48.729
A lot of patients say, "Well, I love."

456
00:16:48.729 --> 00:16:50.770
Yes, but you don't feel it in your chest.

457
00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.350
You don't feel it in the love organ,

458
00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:53.450
which is the heart.

459
00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.855
When you open and feel safe to love someone,

460
00:16:55.855 --> 00:16:58.795
you actually feel that love right here, it's real.

461
00:16:58.795 --> 00:17:01.475
Valentine's Day is actually saying something.

462
00:17:01.475 --> 00:17:02.895
It's reminding you to hear--

463
00:17:02.895 --> 00:17:04.895
heart disease is the process of denying

464
00:17:04.895 --> 00:17:06.854
the experience of our heart.

465
00:17:06.854 --> 00:17:08.535
It's denying the experience of our heart.

466
00:17:08.535 --> 00:17:10.235
When we have kidney disease, you can think of it

467
00:17:10.235 --> 00:17:13.194
in terms of denying the genetic momentum

468
00:17:13.194 --> 00:17:15.234
of our ancestor's, the right kidney has to do

469
00:17:15.234 --> 00:17:16.595
with bonding issues with the dad,

470
00:17:16.595 --> 00:17:19.575
left kidney has to do with bonding issues with the mother.

471
00:17:19.575 --> 00:17:20.590
Take the gallbladder.

472
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:22.350
I'm just giving you an idea of how this

473
00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:23.486
organ wisdom can happen.

474
00:17:23.486 --> 00:17:25.145
Gallbladder is a yang organ.

475
00:17:25.145 --> 00:17:26.766
All your yang organs, your intestines,

476
00:17:26.766 --> 00:17:29.246
your stomach, urinary bladder,

477
00:17:29.246 --> 00:17:31.622
have impure fluids, and your yin organs

478
00:17:31.622 --> 00:17:34.342
have pure fluids, but the gallbladder is a yang organ.

479
00:17:34.342 --> 00:17:36.542
It's a bag with a pure fluid bile,

480
00:17:36.542 --> 00:17:37.552
which is a brilliant, beautiful

481
00:17:37.552 --> 00:17:39.507
turquoise in its natural state.

482
00:17:39.507 --> 00:17:41.667
So, the body uses the gallbladder to understand

483
00:17:41.667 --> 00:17:43.388
what balance is in the world.

484
00:17:43.388 --> 00:17:45.747
When we make a decision, the body uses

485
00:17:45.747 --> 00:17:46.963
the touchstone of the gallbladder,

486
00:17:46.963 --> 00:17:48.723
to yang or influence balance.

487
00:17:48.723 --> 00:17:51.663
Is this a balanced situation?

488
00:17:51.663 --> 00:17:53.903
When we're taught to deny the truth

489
00:17:53.903 --> 00:17:55.803
of how we see our family or the world,

490
00:17:55.803 --> 00:17:59.582
we calibrate the gallbladder to levels of untruth

491
00:17:59.582 --> 00:18:02.422
by putting stones and gravel in it so that we

492
00:18:02.422 --> 00:18:03.723
calibrate it to the untruth that

493
00:18:03.723 --> 00:18:06.063
we're taught to see as true.

494
00:18:06.063 --> 00:18:08.763
So, gallbladder disease is actually, in most cases,

495
00:18:08.763 --> 00:18:11.162
the up-leveling of the gallbladder,

496
00:18:11.162 --> 00:18:14.583
of the stones trying to pass with the resistance

497
00:18:14.583 --> 00:18:16.903
to seeing the new reality.

498
00:18:16.903 --> 00:18:18.182
So, things we call gallbladder disease

499
00:18:18.182 --> 00:18:20.762
is actually an attempt of the gallbladder to get better.

500
00:18:20.762 --> 00:18:22.443
Passing a kidney stone means we don't need

501
00:18:22.443 --> 00:18:24.082
the blockage in the kidneys anymore.

502
00:18:24.082 --> 00:18:25.982
The kidneys are trying to up-level

503
00:18:25.982 --> 00:18:27.820
to a higher level of frequency.

504
00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.300
And so forth, and on and on and on.

505
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.081
So, those are just a few examples

506
00:18:32.081 --> 00:18:34.660
of the signs of illness are really

507
00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:38.141
the signs of transformation, development,

508
00:18:38.141 --> 00:18:40.361
and, I don't know how much time we have

509
00:18:40.361 --> 00:18:42.540
to fit all this in, but there are seasonal influences,

510
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.220
different organs have different seasonal things happening.

511
00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.000
Diseases in the summer, they have to do with

512
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
opening or transcendence,

513
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.760
maybe issues of the heart not working correctly.

514
00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.040
The heart is the time of the summer,

515
00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.200
summer's the heart time.

516
00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.860
So, you can calibrate certain changes

517
00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.783
in the organs of seasonal influences

518
00:19:02.783 --> 00:19:05.044
that are nourishing or suppressing the organs.

519
00:19:05.044 --> 00:19:08.424
There's this whole database of information

520
00:19:08.424 --> 00:19:10.783
that's happening, and all you have to do

521
00:19:10.783 --> 00:19:13.143
is observe it, we all know it.

522
00:19:13.143 --> 00:19:15.304
Late summer is the time of the spleen,

523
00:19:15.304 --> 00:19:17.483
which is neither growing nor not growing.

524
00:19:17.483 --> 00:19:19.323
That there's timeless quality, we go to the beach

525
00:19:19.323 --> 00:19:20.624
in the late summer, August.

526
00:19:20.624 --> 00:19:22.941
Time stops for a while.

527
00:19:22.941 --> 00:19:24.542
That's the quality.

528
00:19:24.542 --> 00:19:27.682
That's the quality of the earth element of the body.

529
00:19:27.682 --> 00:19:29.182
I'm jumping around, but these are--

530
00:19:29.182 --> 00:19:30.902
<v ->No, no, you're not actually--</v>

531
00:19:30.902 --> 00:19:33.581
<v ->These are some examples of that.</v>

532
00:19:33.581 --> 00:19:36.281
Now, there's two very interesting systems.

533
00:19:36.281 --> 00:19:38.381
And the Chinese system, there's a system

534
00:19:38.381 --> 00:19:39.740
called the Six Divisions where you look at

535
00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.280
how things come from the surface

536
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.880
to deeper and deeper and deeper levels.

537
00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.218
The deepest level is the Shao Yin layer.

538
00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:47.735
That's the level when the heart

539
00:19:47.735 --> 00:19:49.614
and the kidneys actually meet.

540
00:19:49.614 --> 00:19:53.534
And that's the beginning of this real spiritual experience,

541
00:19:53.534 --> 00:19:56.095
because you've integrated the physical

542
00:19:56.095 --> 00:19:58.935
with the spiritual at the Shao Yin layer.

543
00:19:58.935 --> 00:20:00.674
Now, it's interesting, a couple years ago

544
00:20:00.674 --> 00:20:03.035
I actually came here to give a talk in another conference,

545
00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:06.534
and I saw an ad for chili con carne

546
00:20:06.534 --> 00:20:09.515
in a paper somewhere, and I realized that carne means meet,

547
00:20:09.515 --> 00:20:12.415
and incarnate means meet, and I realized

548
00:20:12.415 --> 00:20:14.234
that our fundamental spiritual predicament

549
00:20:14.234 --> 00:20:16.074
is to be in the meat.

550
00:20:16.074 --> 00:20:18.215
It's to take all of our spiritual perceptions,

551
00:20:18.215 --> 00:20:20.815
bring it into the body, and body it to earth,

552
00:20:20.815 --> 00:20:23.275
and that's the purpose of being here,

553
00:20:23.275 --> 00:20:25.674
to bring the spiritual into the physical.

554
00:20:25.674 --> 00:20:27.074
And then later, once we get that done,

555
00:20:27.074 --> 00:20:29.454
then we can take the physical back into the spiritual.

556
00:20:29.454 --> 00:20:31.234
From the Christian tradition, you could say

557
00:20:31.234 --> 00:20:34.534
this is how God experiences the creation.

558
00:20:34.534 --> 00:20:36.875
From the Buddhist traditions, it's the integration

559
00:20:36.875 --> 00:20:41.274
into the present, as we breathe, as we learn

560
00:20:41.274 --> 00:20:42.805
to be in the present, as we switch from

561
00:20:42.805 --> 00:20:45.014
sympathetic to parasympathetic,

562
00:20:45.014 --> 00:20:47.394
and we integrate the present into our physiology,

563
00:20:47.394 --> 00:20:49.355
healing happens.

564
00:20:49.355 --> 00:20:51.735
So, it's very interesting how these systems work.

565
00:20:51.735 --> 00:20:54.355
Now, in Germany, in the middle of the last century,

566
00:20:54.355 --> 00:20:57.294
there was a really brilliant physician named Reckeweg,

567
00:20:57.294 --> 00:20:58.835
who looked at--

568
00:20:58.835 --> 00:21:01.215
he was a homeopath and he had developed these formulas

569
00:21:01.215 --> 00:21:03.574
that kind of condensed homeopathic formulas

570
00:21:03.574 --> 00:21:05.915
that he looked at six levels of suppression

571
00:21:05.915 --> 00:21:07.715
of the disease, and this is very important

572
00:21:07.715 --> 00:21:08.954
for what we're talking about.

573
00:21:08.954 --> 00:21:11.274
The first level has to do with normal things.

574
00:21:11.274 --> 00:21:14.914
We spit, we poop, we pee, we sweat,

575
00:21:14.914 --> 00:21:17.154
we have menstruation, we have ejaculation,

576
00:21:17.154 --> 00:21:18.855
we have earwax that comes out,

577
00:21:18.855 --> 00:21:20.114
all the normal things come out,

578
00:21:20.114 --> 00:21:22.094
and these take the toxins out of the body.

579
00:21:22.094 --> 00:21:24.834
When we sweat, chill comes off the shoulders.

580
00:21:24.834 --> 00:21:28.515
A lot of things that we call getting a cold

581
00:21:28.515 --> 00:21:30.835
is actually external cold occluding

582
00:21:30.835 --> 00:21:35.136
the small meridians in the head,

583
00:21:35.136 --> 00:21:38.236
you get chills, fever, runny nose,

584
00:21:38.236 --> 00:21:39.851
these are all signs of invasion by wind.

585
00:21:39.851 --> 00:21:41.431
You sweat, it goes away.

586
00:21:41.431 --> 00:21:43.451
Now, if we don't poop 'cause we're busy,

587
00:21:43.451 --> 00:21:44.971
we don't pee 'cause we're busy,

588
00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:46.791
we don't sweat because we don't want to smell bad

589
00:21:46.791 --> 00:21:49.051
for our date, or all the other things that we hold in.

590
00:21:49.051 --> 00:21:51.051
We hold our emotions in, we hold our tears in,

591
00:21:51.051 --> 00:21:53.851
then the body will create a fever.

592
00:21:53.851 --> 00:21:55.251
When you get a fever, then you sweat,

593
00:21:55.251 --> 00:21:57.107
then you pee or poop, whatever.

594
00:21:57.107 --> 00:21:59.167
Your wife will say, "What are you doing?"

595
00:21:59.167 --> 00:22:00.707
A really great analogy of this is

596
00:22:00.707 --> 00:22:02.667
say we have a hallway in our house,

597
00:22:02.667 --> 00:22:05.022
and I put a bag of laundry or garbage

598
00:22:05.022 --> 00:22:06.883
in the middle of that hallway.

599
00:22:06.883 --> 00:22:09.241
Well, normally you walk by, you take it outside.

600
00:22:09.241 --> 00:22:11.382
So, that would be the first stage, the healthy stage.

601
00:22:11.382 --> 00:22:13.221
The second stage is the inflammation stage,

602
00:22:13.221 --> 00:22:14.921
your wife or whoever lives with you says,

603
00:22:14.921 --> 00:22:16.661
"Get that damn garbage out of the hall."

604
00:22:16.661 --> 00:22:18.282
So, that's the inflammation stage.

605
00:22:18.282 --> 00:22:19.762
The body tries to create inflammation

606
00:22:19.762 --> 00:22:22.561
to further the detox.

607
00:22:22.561 --> 00:22:24.581
So then, if that doesn't happen,

608
00:22:24.581 --> 00:22:26.661
what happens is you push it away.

609
00:22:26.661 --> 00:22:28.462
You push the garbage to the side of the hall,

610
00:22:28.462 --> 00:22:30.021
and you begin to walk by it and it becomes

611
00:22:30.021 --> 00:22:32.541
less important, but the toxicity is there.

612
00:22:32.541 --> 00:22:33.961
Well, those are the first three levels.

613
00:22:33.961 --> 00:22:35.841
Normal release, inflammation, and then

614
00:22:35.841 --> 00:22:37.082
we put things aside.

615
00:22:37.082 --> 00:22:39.602
But once that switches to the fourth level,

616
00:22:39.602 --> 00:22:41.022
then it becomes deeper and deeper,

617
00:22:41.022 --> 00:22:43.841
more deeply impregnated into the system.

618
00:22:43.841 --> 00:22:46.541
We put it inside the closet so we don't see it,

619
00:22:46.541 --> 00:22:49.601
but there's still this biological process of the decay

620
00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:51.842
happening with the toxicity in the closet.

621
00:22:51.842 --> 00:22:53.921
And gradually, the fifth stage is when

622
00:22:53.921 --> 00:22:56.041
the body puts things over that.

623
00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:57.926
And the sixth stage is whenever biological

624
00:22:57.926 --> 00:23:01.565
activities happen, that garbage begins to grow on its own.

625
00:23:01.565 --> 00:23:03.705
This is where cancer, stroke,

626
00:23:03.705 --> 00:23:06.565
heart attack, emphysema, these are the end stages.

627
00:23:06.565 --> 00:23:08.465
Schizophrenia, these are the end stages

628
00:23:08.465 --> 00:23:10.606
of the suppressive pattern that all happens

629
00:23:10.606 --> 00:23:13.365
because we didn't spit, or poop, or pee,

630
00:23:13.365 --> 00:23:15.306
or cry, or ask for what we want.

631
00:23:15.306 --> 00:23:16.365
<v ->The life flow.</v>

632
00:23:16.365 --> 00:23:17.484
<v ->Life flow, yeah.</v>

633
00:23:17.484 --> 00:23:20.285
So, that's the thing that creates cancer.

634
00:23:20.285 --> 00:23:22.545
That's the thing that creates these end-stages diseases.

635
00:23:22.545 --> 00:23:24.445
So, yet we want to have a war on cancer,

636
00:23:24.445 --> 00:23:26.524
we want to have a war on the garbage in the closet.

637
00:23:26.524 --> 00:23:28.144
You could poison them more.

638
00:23:28.144 --> 00:23:29.605
What happens is you alienate it

639
00:23:29.605 --> 00:23:32.125
from the system even farther.

640
00:23:32.125 --> 00:23:33.664
So, we can see that we have this suppression

641
00:23:33.664 --> 00:23:35.764
into the closet, into the biological process

642
00:23:35.764 --> 00:23:38.265
that creates cancer, all these end-stages diseases.

643
00:23:38.265 --> 00:23:39.465
So, now what happens?

644
00:23:39.465 --> 00:23:41.504
We get some vitality, we take a month off work,

645
00:23:41.504 --> 00:23:43.384
we have our house, we decide to clean house.

646
00:23:43.384 --> 00:23:44.921
We go into the closets and the garage

647
00:23:44.921 --> 00:23:45.999
and clean all this stuff out.

648
00:23:45.999 --> 00:23:47.459
"Oh look, there's garbage there."

649
00:23:47.459 --> 00:23:49.359
So, rather than putting more poison on it to kill it,

650
00:23:49.359 --> 00:23:51.160
we say, "Oh," let's open the door,

651
00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.560
let's clean the closet, let's take this outside

652
00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.020
through the hall, it smells pretty bad,

653
00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.077
we better put it in something, take it outside.

654
00:23:57.077 --> 00:23:59.016
We better rinse the closet out,

655
00:23:59.016 --> 00:24:01.597
we better air the house out, then all of a sudden

656
00:24:01.597 --> 00:24:03.537
we have healing.

657
00:24:03.537 --> 00:24:05.337
It's the end-stage.

658
00:24:05.337 --> 00:24:07.996
A friend of mine, a Taoist teacher,

659
00:24:07.996 --> 00:24:09.937
he thinks that the tumor is actually

660
00:24:09.937 --> 00:24:13.313
a protection against what he calls biolifes

661
00:24:13.313 --> 00:24:15.831
which is a nanobacteria that's even smaller

662
00:24:15.831 --> 00:24:17.511
that he sees in his reality.

663
00:24:17.511 --> 00:24:19.471
So, there's all kinds of ways to think about it.

664
00:24:19.471 --> 00:24:21.052
But the fundamental thing is with these

665
00:24:21.052 --> 00:24:23.332
end diseases that are the problem with our culture,

666
00:24:23.332 --> 00:24:25.191
our culture doesn't want symptoms,

667
00:24:25.191 --> 00:24:26.991
our culture doesn't want to hear emotions,

668
00:24:26.991 --> 00:24:28.671
our culture doesn't really want to hear

669
00:24:28.671 --> 00:24:30.651
the truth about how we think and how we feel.

670
00:24:30.651 --> 00:24:32.592
Our culture just wants to make things quiet,

671
00:24:32.592 --> 00:24:34.371
make things nice, and in that process,

672
00:24:34.371 --> 00:24:35.691
we don't poop when we have to,

673
00:24:35.691 --> 00:24:36.972
we don't pee when we have to,

674
00:24:36.972 --> 00:24:38.392
we don't say the truth when we have to,

675
00:24:38.392 --> 00:24:40.691
we don't sweat, we don't cough,

676
00:24:40.691 --> 00:24:42.151
we don't spit or whatever it is,

677
00:24:42.151 --> 00:24:45.212
then this stuff goes deeper and deeper and deeper.

678
00:24:45.212 --> 00:24:47.251
<v ->And then you get into the Western model of medicine</v>

679
00:24:47.251 --> 00:24:48.571
once it goes too deep.

680
00:24:48.571 --> 00:24:51.591
<v ->Yeah, but the concept of,</v>

681
00:24:51.591 --> 00:24:53.832
"Oh, you have a fever. Take an aspirin."

682
00:24:53.832 --> 00:24:54.911
"Oh, you're coughing.

683
00:24:54.911 --> 00:24:56.631
Take something to take the cough away."

684
00:24:56.631 --> 00:24:58.551
When coughing wants to bring stuff out of the lungs,

685
00:24:58.551 --> 00:25:00.771
or it shows that the throat is dry,

686
00:25:00.771 --> 00:25:02.431
indefficiency or excess heat.

687
00:25:02.431 --> 00:25:03.932
We can go into either of that.

688
00:25:03.932 --> 00:25:05.412
The whole emotional thing is like

689
00:25:05.412 --> 00:25:07.051
this whole idea of depression.

690
00:25:07.051 --> 00:25:10.051
Depression is, we can say is, suppression.

691
00:25:10.051 --> 00:25:14.392
When I hold my feelings in, I don't function well.

692
00:25:14.392 --> 00:25:17.111
If I'm holding my anger, my hurt in,

693
00:25:17.111 --> 00:25:18.621
all of the sudden there's a big part of me

694
00:25:18.621 --> 00:25:20.672
that's holding in, I have no vitality,

695
00:25:20.672 --> 00:25:22.170
I have no passion, it's not okay

696
00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:23.369
because it's all holding this ball

697
00:25:23.369 --> 00:25:24.809
of hurt inside me.

698
00:25:24.809 --> 00:25:25.608
I'm depressed.

699
00:25:25.608 --> 00:25:27.178
So, give me something to depress me more

700
00:25:27.178 --> 00:25:28.828
so I don't feel it.

701
00:25:29.564 --> 00:25:31.704
You said I'm going to vote republican.

702
00:25:31.704 --> 00:25:32.844
(laughs)

703
00:25:32.844 --> 00:25:35.404
<v ->Is that how you have so many republicans?</v>

704
00:25:35.404 --> 00:25:37.244
<v ->Actually, we need good republicans,</v>

705
00:25:37.244 --> 00:25:38.604
we need good everybody right now.

706
00:25:38.604 --> 00:25:40.904
I shouldn't really polarize it like that.

707
00:25:42.784 --> 00:25:46.197
<v ->Now, going deeper into the contrast of</v>

708
00:25:46.197 --> 00:25:47.797
how we can pull ourselves out.

709
00:25:47.797 --> 00:25:49.458
If most of the people watching this

710
00:25:49.458 --> 00:25:51.178
are in Western cultures, they're working

711
00:25:51.178 --> 00:25:53.297
on a Western medical model, how do we

712
00:25:53.297 --> 00:25:55.458
begin participating in our own healing,

713
00:25:55.458 --> 00:25:57.377
in spite of a system that may not be

714
00:25:57.377 --> 00:25:59.697
helping that much, and pull ourselves out?

715
00:25:59.697 --> 00:26:01.697
<v ->Well, we have to ask ourselves the basic question:</v>

716
00:26:01.697 --> 00:26:03.157
what makes me feel good?

717
00:26:03.157 --> 00:26:04.677
What do I like?

718
00:26:04.677 --> 00:26:06.197
What am I drawn to?

719
00:26:06.197 --> 00:26:07.657
What makes me feel bad?

720
00:26:07.657 --> 00:26:10.777
Who in my life am I around that I don't feel good with?

721
00:26:10.777 --> 00:26:13.777
I mean that's the most important question.

722
00:26:13.777 --> 00:26:15.337
How many times do you start a talk and you say,

723
00:26:15.337 --> 00:26:16.537
"Okay, everybody get comfortable."

724
00:26:16.537 --> 00:26:17.557
Half the audience moves.

725
00:26:17.557 --> 00:26:20.077
Why weren't you comfortable before?

726
00:26:20.077 --> 00:26:22.357
We have a right to be happy.

727
00:26:22.357 --> 00:26:23.997
We have a right to feel good.

728
00:26:23.997 --> 00:26:25.237
We have a right to have people around us

729
00:26:25.237 --> 00:26:27.609
that love us, support us, acknowledge us,

730
00:26:27.609 --> 00:26:30.629
help us to be who we are, and then we reciprocate.

731
00:26:30.629 --> 00:26:32.269
If we're in a life that doesn't support that,

732
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:34.169
you have to ask yourself, "Why am I here?

733
00:26:34.169 --> 00:26:36.769
What am I accomplishing? Why do I have to be unhappy?

734
00:26:36.769 --> 00:26:38.109
Why do I have to be in pain?"

735
00:26:38.109 --> 00:26:39.749
And the answer is, you don't.

736
00:26:39.749 --> 00:26:41.229
And you may not be able to change it

737
00:26:41.229 --> 00:26:43.285
in one day, or two days, or a week, even a year,

738
00:26:43.285 --> 00:26:45.245
but by knowing you have a right to be happy,

739
00:26:45.245 --> 00:26:46.665
you have a right to feel good,

740
00:26:46.665 --> 00:26:48.685
and you can identify I don't feel good in my work,

741
00:26:48.685 --> 00:26:50.325
I don't feel good in my relationship.

742
00:26:50.325 --> 00:26:53.205
I can change my work, I can fix my relationship.

743
00:26:53.205 --> 00:26:55.945
Maybe my husband or my wife needs to heal also,

744
00:26:55.945 --> 00:26:58.105
or maybe we're just not the right combination together,

745
00:26:58.105 --> 00:26:59.405
whatever.

746
00:26:59.405 --> 00:27:01.544
We have a right to start where we are.

747
00:27:01.544 --> 00:27:03.865
Now, if you look at the Buddhist model,

748
00:27:03.865 --> 00:27:04.985
it's very interesting.

749
00:27:04.985 --> 00:27:06.945
They have the Hinayana, Mahayana, Vajrayana,

750
00:27:06.945 --> 00:27:08.305
you don't have to remember those names,

751
00:27:08.305 --> 00:27:11.055
but the first level is, I'm gonna sit still,

752
00:27:11.055 --> 00:27:12.655
I'm gonna learn to be with myself,

753
00:27:12.655 --> 00:27:15.071
I'm gonna learn to be calm and face everything

754
00:27:15.071 --> 00:27:17.411
inside me that keeps me from being calm,

755
00:27:17.411 --> 00:27:19.551
keeps me from being comfortable with myself,

756
00:27:19.551 --> 00:27:20.811
I'm gonna be coherent.

757
00:27:20.811 --> 00:27:23.171
Like Siddhartha said, "I can think, I can fast, I can wait."

758
00:27:23.171 --> 00:27:26.391
That's the beginning Buddhist model.

759
00:27:26.391 --> 00:27:28.611
Getting myself in mind, getting myself clear,

760
00:27:28.611 --> 00:27:30.071
healing myself.

761
00:27:30.071 --> 00:27:31.551
The second level, the Mahayana level,

762
00:27:31.551 --> 00:27:34.211
is a path of the great compassion, the great vehicle.

763
00:27:34.211 --> 00:27:36.191
I can be selfless, but it's a selfless

764
00:27:36.191 --> 00:27:38.371
predicated on a healed self.

765
00:27:38.371 --> 00:27:40.312
If I've giving myself away and I'm not healed,

766
00:27:40.312 --> 00:27:44.351
I'm giving a faulty present, I'm not giving a whole gift.

767
00:27:44.351 --> 00:27:46.631
So, once we heal ourselves and become clear,

768
00:27:46.631 --> 00:27:49.311
then we can be selfless, the self becomes unimportant

769
00:27:49.311 --> 00:27:51.331
because there's nothing left to heal here.

770
00:27:51.331 --> 00:27:54.670
We learn of being selfless, and in service, and all that,

771
00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:56.931
And the third stage is, once I feel clear

772
00:27:56.931 --> 00:27:59.711
in the contraction, once I feel clear in the expansion,

773
00:27:59.711 --> 00:28:02.291
which is selfless, then I can become clear in the dance

774
00:28:02.291 --> 00:28:05.491
of the spiritual warrior, which is the Vajrayana path,

775
00:28:05.491 --> 00:28:08.391
because I'm whole, I'm compassionate,

776
00:28:08.391 --> 00:28:09.991
I'm not holding onto myself,

777
00:28:09.991 --> 00:28:11.211
I'm not holding onto the selfless.

778
00:28:11.211 --> 00:28:14.131
Therefore, when I have enlightened spiritual action

779
00:28:14.131 --> 00:28:16.331
as a spiritual warrior, I have enlightened activity

780
00:28:16.331 --> 00:28:19.231
because it's not reactive, it's expressive from

781
00:28:19.231 --> 00:28:21.731
my Buddha nature or my Christ consciousness,

782
00:28:21.731 --> 00:28:23.231
and that's the difference.

783
00:28:23.231 --> 00:28:25.391
So, if we take a healing model, the first thing is

784
00:28:25.391 --> 00:28:28.831
to find out, I hurt, I'm unhappy.

785
00:28:28.831 --> 00:28:32.391
It's okay not to hurt, and it's okay to be happy.

786
00:28:32.391 --> 00:28:34.011
Start there.

787
00:28:34.011 --> 00:28:36.411
Most of us in our culture, we give ourselves away.

788
00:28:36.411 --> 00:28:39.091
We take care of ourselves, we don't listen to ourselves,

789
00:28:39.091 --> 00:28:40.691
we're trying to heal others and, in a way,

790
00:28:40.691 --> 00:28:42.591
we're not really serving them or us.

791
00:28:42.591 --> 00:28:45.048
<v ->And we even give our two week vacations away.</v>

792
00:28:45.048 --> 00:28:47.177
<v ->Yeah, in Germany they get six weeks.</v>

793
00:28:47.177 --> 00:28:50.322
I'm sure Cheney gets nine weeks, whatever.

794
00:28:50.322 --> 00:28:52.325
<v ->But it's a sign of an ill culture that doesn't value this.</v>

795
00:28:52.325 --> 00:28:53.676
<v ->It's the sign of an ill culture</v>

796
00:28:53.676 --> 00:28:57.035
and we don't acknowledge the family.

797
00:28:57.035 --> 00:28:59.289
Many cultures in the world, they know who they were,

798
00:28:59.289 --> 00:29:01.029
they know where there land is.

799
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:03.729
Twenty years ago, we didn't have Thai food.

800
00:29:03.729 --> 00:29:07.409
Twenty years ago, we didn't have the religions that we have.

801
00:29:07.409 --> 00:29:10.209
Twenty years ago, we probably lived somewhere else.

802
00:29:10.209 --> 00:29:11.269
Our culture's in flux.

803
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:13.649
Now, this is a good thing, because it allows us

804
00:29:13.649 --> 00:29:16.329
to break the patterns, to open up

805
00:29:16.329 --> 00:29:18.809
to new possibilities, and when the dust settles,

806
00:29:18.809 --> 00:29:20.890
we'll find new paradigms that allow us

807
00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:22.889
to live in ways that we want to live

808
00:29:22.889 --> 00:29:25.969
and feel better as humans, because through the wars,

809
00:29:25.969 --> 00:29:27.509
through the corporate mentality,

810
00:29:27.509 --> 00:29:30.549
through the difficulties that have created the changes

811
00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:32.269
in this country and the world--

812
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:35.189
we're going from an isolated, small, village culture

813
00:29:35.189 --> 00:29:37.629
to a global culture, we're not there yet.

814
00:29:37.629 --> 00:29:39.469
We're experimenting, we're getting new ideas,

815
00:29:39.469 --> 00:29:41.149
things are opening and releasing.

816
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:42.609
The old is kind of falling away.

817
00:29:42.609 --> 00:29:44.869
I mean, the corporate mentality isn't working.

818
00:29:44.869 --> 00:29:46.569
Even they're looking at green possibilities

819
00:29:46.569 --> 00:29:48.189
'cause that's what works.

820
00:29:48.189 --> 00:29:50.449
So, in the midst of all this chaos and unsettlement,

821
00:29:50.449 --> 00:29:52.409
people begin to find themselves,

822
00:29:52.409 --> 00:29:55.389
they begin to find others that feel right with them,

823
00:29:55.389 --> 00:29:57.629
we begin to have new kind of communities,

824
00:29:57.629 --> 00:30:00.409
we get a sense that we can feel whole,

825
00:30:00.409 --> 00:30:02.650
we can solve the problems, we can bring this

826
00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:05.009
enlightened nature to function in the world

827
00:30:05.009 --> 00:30:07.529
in a really healthy and happy way.

828
00:30:07.529 --> 00:30:08.749
And that's the fundamental healing,

829
00:30:08.749 --> 00:30:13.029
and in that milieu, we don't have schizophrenia,

830
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:14.669
because the personality doesn't have to

831
00:30:14.669 --> 00:30:15.989
break through something obstructed

832
00:30:15.989 --> 00:30:17.369
to find a new way.

833
00:30:17.369 --> 00:30:19.589
We don't necessarily have these end-stages diseases

834
00:30:19.589 --> 00:30:22.109
because we've gotten to be ourself and be in our truth,

835
00:30:22.109 --> 00:30:23.989
and all the way along the way,

836
00:30:23.989 --> 00:30:25.849
we don't get there most of the time.

837
00:30:25.849 --> 00:30:27.149
<v ->And we really need to start with the way</v>

838
00:30:27.149 --> 00:30:28.449
we raise our children.

839
00:30:28.449 --> 00:30:29.608
<v ->Oh, absolutely.</v>

840
00:30:29.608 --> 00:30:30.909
<v ->Get 'em off to the right place.</v>

841
00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:33.209
<v ->If I don't know myself, how can I be myself</v>

842
00:30:33.209 --> 00:30:34.509
with my child?

843
00:30:34.509 --> 00:30:37.629
If I don't feel safe and experience love and vulnerability,

844
00:30:37.629 --> 00:30:41.229
how can I have love and vulnerability with my child?

845
00:30:41.229 --> 00:30:43.149
I spent about 10 years looking at the energetics

846
00:30:43.149 --> 00:30:46.769
of wounding, bonding, and intimacy.

847
00:30:46.769 --> 00:30:48.069
What I discovered--

848
00:30:48.069 --> 00:30:49.509
'cause when my first marriage broke down,

849
00:30:49.509 --> 00:30:51.588
I looked at the physiology of all these

850
00:30:51.588 --> 00:30:53.589
different relationship systems trying to

851
00:30:53.589 --> 00:30:55.789
understand what I couldn't hold.

852
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:58.130
It was like trying to hold water in your hand.

853
00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:59.589
I couldn't hold it.

854
00:30:59.589 --> 00:31:02.179
What I looked at was,

855
00:31:02.179 --> 00:31:04.029
energetically, we have--

856
00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:05.749
just like a magnet, North and South Pole--

857
00:31:05.749 --> 00:31:07.709
we have a North and South Pole in our body.

858
00:31:07.709 --> 00:31:09.409
Our spine you can say is the North Pole,

859
00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:11.409
up the front is the South Pole,

860
00:31:11.409 --> 00:31:13.589
yin and yang polarities in the body.

861
00:31:13.589 --> 00:31:16.509
When we have a healthy, happy, integrated

862
00:31:16.509 --> 00:31:18.889
well-bonded family, we have a full polarity

863
00:31:18.889 --> 00:31:20.329
on the front and back.

864
00:31:20.329 --> 00:31:21.849
When we have a bonding issue with our

865
00:31:21.849 --> 00:31:24.009
opposite sex parent, little boy with mom,

866
00:31:24.009 --> 00:31:26.069
little girl with a dad, we switch to the spine

867
00:31:26.069 --> 00:31:28.769
and we become more cerebral, more defended,

868
00:31:28.769 --> 00:31:32.989
less connected internally, we become a red state.

869
00:31:32.989 --> 00:31:34.669
That would be the characteristic of that.

870
00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:36.889
But when we have a same-sex bonding issue,

871
00:31:36.889 --> 00:31:38.828
little boy with his dad, little girl with his mom,

872
00:31:38.828 --> 00:31:41.349
we go away from the spine toward the front,

873
00:31:41.349 --> 00:31:43.469
we become more touch-feely, we become more

874
00:31:43.469 --> 00:31:45.148
feeling-centered, more intuitive,

875
00:31:45.148 --> 00:31:47.885
but it's harder to get that out in the world.

876
00:31:47.885 --> 00:31:49.845
We become a blue state.

877
00:31:49.845 --> 00:31:51.685
Obviously this is just a characterization,

878
00:31:51.685 --> 00:31:54.145
but that's the concept.

879
00:31:54.145 --> 00:31:58.125
So, what I realized was that when we do

880
00:31:58.125 --> 00:32:00.645
meditative practices, Qigong practices

881
00:32:00.645 --> 00:32:03.065
to begin to open these polarities,

882
00:32:03.065 --> 00:32:07.005
it shifts the whole paradigm of how we are in the family.

883
00:32:07.005 --> 00:32:10.065
This is the physiological basis of lack of bonding,

884
00:32:10.065 --> 00:32:13.115
lack of being present for our children.

885
00:32:13.115 --> 00:32:15.265
And bonding happens in physical, emotional,

886
00:32:15.265 --> 00:32:18.545
mental, and spiritual levels, so a parent has to be there,

887
00:32:18.545 --> 00:32:20.385
that's probably a whole other tape,

888
00:32:20.385 --> 00:32:22.785
but there is a physiology that I figured out to all this.

889
00:32:22.785 --> 00:32:26.405
So, it's very interesting, it's not out there.

890
00:32:26.405 --> 00:32:28.505
There's really pieces of the puzzle

891
00:32:28.505 --> 00:32:30.205
that you can identify that are missing

892
00:32:30.205 --> 00:32:32.245
or shifted and you can re-shift them,

893
00:32:32.245 --> 00:32:34.485
and then very positive things happen.

894
00:32:34.485 --> 00:32:36.845
<v ->Well, we'll have to do a part two on that one day.</v>

895
00:32:36.845 --> 00:32:38.095
<v ->Yeah, I'd like to do that.</v>

896
00:32:38.095 --> 00:32:39.295
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

897
00:32:39.295 --> 00:32:44.226
So, to summarize, the dance between

898
00:32:44.226 --> 00:32:46.725
the East and the West, and what

899
00:32:46.725 --> 00:32:49.225
one may have to teach the other,

900
00:32:49.225 --> 00:32:51.305
or is this one way?

901
00:32:51.305 --> 00:32:52.485
<v ->No, it's not one way.</v>

902
00:32:52.485 --> 00:32:54.145
It's like the blind man and the elephant.

903
00:32:54.145 --> 00:32:56.905
I see a tree, or I see a mountain, or I feel a snake.

904
00:32:56.905 --> 00:32:59.965
It's the same; it's all part of the same body.

905
00:32:59.965 --> 00:33:01.624
And it's not just the Western physiology

906
00:33:01.624 --> 00:33:04.505
and Eastern model, there is higher energy levels,

907
00:33:04.505 --> 00:33:06.885
and there's deeper levels, but it's all part

908
00:33:06.885 --> 00:33:08.365
of the same human.

909
00:33:08.365 --> 00:33:11.185
And the more we include all the different aspects

910
00:33:11.185 --> 00:33:12.485
that we can know and discover,

911
00:33:12.485 --> 00:33:13.785
then the bigger picture we get.

912
00:33:13.785 --> 00:33:15.265
When you really put the Eastern model

913
00:33:15.265 --> 00:33:18.826
with the Western model, you have a model of psychology.

914
00:33:18.826 --> 00:33:20.725
you have a model that we can understand

915
00:33:20.725 --> 00:33:24.125
better ways to do education, better ways to do law,

916
00:33:24.125 --> 00:33:25.485
better ways to do healing,

917
00:33:25.485 --> 00:33:27.046
better ways to construct community,

918
00:33:27.046 --> 00:33:28.445
better ways to do architecture,

919
00:33:28.445 --> 00:33:30.205
because we understand the needs

920
00:33:30.205 --> 00:33:33.185
and the foibles that makes us human,

921
00:33:33.185 --> 00:33:34.825
and that's what I find so positive,

922
00:33:34.825 --> 00:33:36.825
and so amazing.

923
00:33:36.825 --> 00:33:37.925
The world is a miracle.

924
00:33:37.925 --> 00:33:39.165
We forget that,

925
00:33:39.165 --> 00:33:42.925
but when you look what's here, we are a miracle.

926
00:33:42.925 --> 00:33:45.285
We live that every day, and when we think

927
00:33:45.285 --> 00:33:46.985
our world is mundane or boring,

928
00:33:46.985 --> 00:33:49.365
it means we've lost the conception of ourself,

929
00:33:49.365 --> 00:33:53.625
we've lost the feeling of life and creation

930
00:33:53.625 --> 00:33:56.045
and our Buddha nature inside ourselves,

931
00:33:56.045 --> 00:33:58.485
and that's the main disease, and the main

932
00:33:58.485 --> 00:34:00.427
healing is discovering it again.

933
00:34:02.777 --> 00:34:04.257
<v ->Peter Fairfield has also worked with</v>

934
00:34:04.257 --> 00:34:06.757
Harry Oldfield's technology and watch

935
00:34:06.757 --> 00:34:09.560
the auric fields of his clients shift in real time

936
00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.660
as a result of his hands-on care.

937
00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:13.461
