00:00:00.705 --> 00:00:02.727
<v ->It's hard to believe that something as simple as</v>

2
00:00:02.727 --> 00:00:04.475
stating what you're worried about while

3
00:00:04.475 --> 00:00:06.497
tapping on a few acupuncture points

4
00:00:06.497 --> 00:00:09.014
can have a profound impact on how that issue

5
00:00:09.014 --> 00:00:11.163
impacts your life, but it can.

6
00:00:11.163 --> 00:00:12.941
Philip Mountrose and his wife Jane

7
00:00:12.941 --> 00:00:15.071
have co-authored several books and CDs

8
00:00:15.071 --> 00:00:17.082
on a healing modality known as

9
00:00:17.082 --> 00:00:19.104
"The Emotional Freedom Technique."

10
00:00:19.104 --> 00:00:20.853
The reason we did this interview is because

11
00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:23.818
it is the most often-requested subject by our viewers.

12
00:00:23.818 --> 00:00:26.153
Millions of people have been helped by this simple,

13
00:00:26.153 --> 00:00:28.669
profound, and free technology.

14
00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:30.708
What I found interesting is that it goes against

15
00:00:30.708 --> 00:00:32.981
what some healers feel is the proper way

16
00:00:32.981 --> 00:00:35.039
to use affirmations.

17
00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:37.423
(gentle music)

18
00:00:43.631 --> 00:00:46.672
<v Voiceover>Give us a thumbnail sketch of what EFT is.</v>

19
00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:48.870
The reason I contacted you is because so many of our

20
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.282
viewers have requested that we do an interview

21
00:00:51.282 --> 00:00:53.686
regarding EFT, so some of the people are familiar

22
00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:55.697
with it, some have never heard of it before,

23
00:00:55.697 --> 00:00:58.561
so on behalf of all of us, what is it?

24
00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:01.898
<v ->EFT stand for Emotional Freedom Techniques,</v>

25
00:01:01.898 --> 00:01:03.750
which seems to be a good name for it,

26
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.474
because it does have a lot to do with being

27
00:01:05.474 --> 00:01:08.165
emotional and connecting with your emotions

28
00:01:08.165 --> 00:01:12.440
and becoming freer, and it's a technique that's a very

29
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.577
simple, easy to do technique, we can show it in a couple

30
00:01:15.577 --> 00:01:19.616
minutes, easy intervention, remarkable things can happen

31
00:01:19.616 --> 00:01:23.484
from doing this little acupressure tapping technique,

32
00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:27.750
I just demonstrated four of the points, that's ...

33
00:01:28.117 --> 00:01:30.252
A child can do it, and children have done it with

34
00:01:30.252 --> 00:01:34.319
successful results, so it's an acupressure,

35
00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:36.414
not an acupuncture, there's no needles, there's

36
00:01:36.414 --> 00:01:40.688
just fingers, a tapping technique combined with

37
00:01:40.688 --> 00:01:45.477
affirmations for clearing virtually anything.

38
00:01:46.103 --> 00:01:50.673
It could be psychological, emotional, sometimes physical,

39
00:01:50.673 --> 00:01:54.599
and of course, as people know, those are connected,

40
00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:58.547
in fact they're often very connected, and if people

41
00:01:58.547 --> 00:02:01.117
just do EFT for physical things, sometimes remarkable

42
00:02:01.117 --> 00:02:04.080
things happen, but you want to go deeper

43
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.281
if you want to get the emotional, psychological,

44
00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:10.357
spiritual core of issues, and you can use EFT for that

45
00:02:10.357 --> 00:02:11.417
as well.

46
00:02:11.417 --> 00:02:13.585
<v Voiceover>Now, I've seen you speak and do a little</v>

47
00:02:13.585 --> 00:02:16.027
demonstration to the audience, and you're right,

48
00:02:16.027 --> 00:02:18.564
it does seem like it's very direct, very simple,

49
00:02:18.564 --> 00:02:22.498
but I think what myself and others will be

50
00:02:22.498 --> 00:02:26.004
interested in here is, how is it possible that something

51
00:02:26.004 --> 00:02:28.838
that simple, working with intention and acupuncture

52
00:02:28.838 --> 00:02:30.474
meridians go so deep?

53
00:02:30.474 --> 00:02:33.280
Can you tell us a bit of the science background,

54
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.949
and then science behind it?

55
00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:38.335
<v ->A bit of the background, it's based on the ancient</v>

56
00:02:38.335 --> 00:02:41.529
eastern Meridian System, this twelve circuits that

57
00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:43.941
go through your body, and these tapping points,

58
00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:48.150
the seven major tapping points in EFT are related to

59
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.231
the organs and meridians by certain names,

60
00:02:51.231 --> 00:02:53.962
your gall bladder and your bladder meridian,

61
00:02:53.962 --> 00:02:58.186
and your stomach meridian, and these are key points

62
00:02:58.844 --> 00:03:03.363
that get congested with stress, and

63
00:03:03.363 --> 00:03:06.244
blockages on all levels, namely spiritual,

64
00:03:06.244 --> 00:03:08.454
mental, emotional, physical.

65
00:03:08.953 --> 00:03:12.601
So when you have something that bothers you,

66
00:03:12.601 --> 00:03:15.208
it affects your thoughts,

67
00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:18.965
affects your emotions, and stresses your body,

68
00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:21.014
and these key points are where there's

69
00:03:21.014 --> 00:03:23.109
congestion, like freeways coming together,

70
00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.506
are major intersections, blockages, that jam up,

71
00:03:28.024 --> 00:03:31.428
and by tapping the points with the intent of releasing

72
00:03:31.428 --> 00:03:34.384
the specific blockage, for instance, if you're angry at

73
00:03:34.384 --> 00:03:36.962
your boyfriend because of how he criticized you,

74
00:03:36.962 --> 00:03:39.178
that's a specific, and the more specific you get,

75
00:03:39.178 --> 00:03:40.432
usually the better.

76
00:03:40.432 --> 00:03:44.193
"Because he criticized me for the way I made the meal."

77
00:03:44.193 --> 00:03:48.430
That's real specific yesterday, and that specific blockage,

78
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.754
which generalizes and related to other things,

79
00:03:50.754 --> 00:03:54.213
is contained within your system, your system being

80
00:03:54.213 --> 00:03:56.245
all the levels of your system.

81
00:03:57.736 --> 00:04:01.747
Again, psychological, mental, emotional, spiritual,

82
00:04:01.747 --> 00:04:04.581
and you free these up by tapping and releasing the

83
00:04:04.581 --> 00:04:07.079
energy in them, and it's not totally understood,

84
00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.211
of course, science ...

85
00:04:08.211 --> 00:04:09.398
<v Voiceover>Because you're working with quantum science</v>

86
00:04:09.398 --> 00:04:11.157
in the end, where everything is.

87
00:04:11.157 --> 00:04:14.520
<v ->And if you ask scientists, "Why are things happening</v>

88
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.597
"the way they are?", doctors, they don't really know

89
00:04:16.597 --> 00:04:18.865
the bottom line either about a lot of it because,

90
00:04:18.865 --> 00:04:21.819
if it all comes down to energy, you get to a certain

91
00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:25.083
logical, logistical point, and science is useful,

92
00:04:25.083 --> 00:04:27.525
and then you go beyond that and you're in

93
00:04:27.525 --> 00:04:30.845
uncharted territory, but it works, that's why it's so

94
00:04:30.845 --> 00:04:32.855
popular and why millions of people around the world

95
00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:34.753
have used it successfully.

96
00:04:34.753 --> 00:04:37.693
<v Voiceover>Can we talk about the person that founded</v>

97
00:04:37.693 --> 00:04:40.258
this technique, his name, Gary Craig,

98
00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:42.366
and can you talk about him a little bit?

99
00:04:42.366 --> 00:04:44.356
Is that true, did he originate this,

100
00:04:44.356 --> 00:04:46.011
or did he popularize it?

101
00:04:46.011 --> 00:04:49.037
<v ->Well, let's just go one step before who taught</v>

102
00:04:49.037 --> 00:04:53.061
Gary Craig, it was a man named Roger Callahan,

103
00:04:53.061 --> 00:04:56.395
therapist, still a man alive today, older man,

104
00:04:56.395 --> 00:05:00.116
he was, pioneering therapist, knew that the

105
00:05:00.116 --> 00:05:02.943
meridian somehow affected the energy,

106
00:05:02.943 --> 00:05:06.958
and with a client who had a water phobia, fear of water,

107
00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.604
he said, "Let me try something.",

108
00:05:08.604 --> 00:05:11.344
tapped this point, it's a stomach meridian point

109
00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:13.805
because you would become nauseous when

110
00:05:13.805 --> 00:05:16.137
thinking about her water phobia.

111
00:05:16.778 --> 00:05:21.357
And so, lo and behold, this actually cured her

112
00:05:21.357 --> 00:05:25.031
phobia permanently, by tapping this one point.

113
00:05:25.031 --> 00:05:28.023
I consider it a miracle, and more cosmically,

114
00:05:28.023 --> 00:05:30.896
we were ready for this amazing technology

115
00:05:30.896 --> 00:05:32.824
to come into existence.

116
00:05:32.824 --> 00:05:35.650
Now, it's not always as simple as tapping one point.

117
00:05:36.514 --> 00:05:39.272
Roger Callahan then developed protocols,

118
00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:41.733
a series of tapping points, these ...

119
00:05:42.433 --> 00:05:44.705
basically, these seven points particularly,

120
00:05:44.705 --> 00:05:48.391
these key acupressure points, and he would work with

121
00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:50.594
addictions, and depressions, and many thing that had

122
00:05:50.594 --> 00:05:54.716
remarkable results so much, in fact, that he became

123
00:05:54.716 --> 00:05:57.420
bankrupt at a certain point, because he would go through ...

124
00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.082
or virtually bankrupt, because he would go through his

125
00:05:59.082 --> 00:06:01.889
clients so quickly, because he was so successful.

126
00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:02.973
<v Voiceover>(laughs)</v>

127
00:06:02.973 --> 00:06:05.432
<v ->Ironically, in a way, the more successful you are</v>

128
00:06:05.432 --> 00:06:07.755
in this culture with healing ...

129
00:06:07.755 --> 00:06:09.093
<v Voiceover>The less money you make.</v>

130
00:06:09.093 --> 00:06:10.702
<v ->Well then, you know, the person isn't with you</v>

131
00:06:10.702 --> 00:06:12.171
for six months or a year.

132
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:13.640
<v voiceover>Right, as it should be.</v>

133
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.105
<v ->As it should be.
<v Voiceover>As it should be.</v>

134
00:06:15.105 --> 00:06:16.528
<v ->And that's the way it should be, however,</v>

135
00:06:16.528 --> 00:06:19.023
he was quite entrepreneurial, he started charging

136
00:06:19.023 --> 00:06:21.342
people quite a large sum of money for these

137
00:06:21.342 --> 00:06:24.299
weekend seminars, what he called it, Thought Field,

138
00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:26.985
TFT, Thought Field Therapy, and one of his students

139
00:06:26.985 --> 00:06:28.696
who took his ten thousand dollar weekend was

140
00:06:28.696 --> 00:06:32.993
Gary Craig, an engineer, and Gary Craig figured that

141
00:06:32.993 --> 00:06:36.995
he could systematize, and simplify, and get an

142
00:06:36.995 --> 00:06:39.985
universal overhaul technique of Roger Callahan's

143
00:06:39.985 --> 00:06:44.454
various tapping techniques, and the essence boiled down

144
00:06:44.454 --> 00:06:47.008
to seven pressure points, some of which I've

145
00:06:47.008 --> 00:06:49.787
just showed you again, and ...

146
00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:52.089
and an affirmation.

147
00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:54.277
Instead of having different points for different problems,

148
00:06:54.277 --> 00:06:57.287
which, although simple, it's a little more confusing to

149
00:06:57.287 --> 00:07:01.579
figure out which series, which protocols for which problems,

150
00:07:01.579 --> 00:07:06.067
so just do seven points, tap 'em all for any problem,

151
00:07:06.067 --> 00:07:08.480
Gary Craig said, called it Emotional Freedom Techinques,

152
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.792
EFT, and then you don't have to figure out which points,

153
00:07:13.186 --> 00:07:15.526
if you maybe only had to tap two or three, you see,

154
00:07:15.526 --> 00:07:18.127
but to tap seven points, it makes it easier.

155
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.243
And this was around, Gary Craig was around 1990s

156
00:07:22.243 --> 00:07:25.403
that he came out, the early 1990s,

157
00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:27.902
Roger Callahan just early 1980s, we're talking about

158
00:07:27.902 --> 00:07:30.839
something that's very new, very revolutionary

159
00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:34.273
for what people thought was possible, and now a

160
00:07:34.273 --> 00:07:37.500
proliferation of energy therapies, as this is called,

161
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.877
energy healing, but if you haven't heard about it,

162
00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:42.779
it almost sounds too good to be true because it's

163
00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:45.995
so simple and yet so effective, and so many people have had

164
00:07:45.995 --> 00:07:49.323
incredible results from phobias, weight problems,

165
00:07:49.323 --> 00:07:53.717
pain, insomnia, improving performance,

166
00:07:54.197 --> 00:07:55.903
the list goes on and on.

167
00:07:57.351 --> 00:07:59.624
<v Voiceover>Maybe this would be an appropriate time,</v>

168
00:07:59.624 --> 00:08:01.476
before we get into other questions about it,

169
00:08:01.476 --> 00:08:05.767
to give people a little idea of what it looks like,

170
00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:09.592
and how you might utilize it, so maybe take the

171
00:08:09.592 --> 00:08:11.651
example you gave of someone being upset because

172
00:08:11.651 --> 00:08:14.521
their boyfirend criticized them, let's stick with that one

173
00:08:14.521 --> 00:08:17.556
for any women watching here that have boyfriends that

174
00:08:17.556 --> 00:08:21.352
criticize them, and we'll do it the way you would do it

175
00:08:21.352 --> 00:08:24.205
in real life, the way you would demonstrate it,

176
00:08:24.205 --> 00:08:26.019
the way you would do it if you were practicing it.

177
00:08:26.019 --> 00:08:28.506
<v ->Sure, and let me take it from an example of a</v>

178
00:08:28.506 --> 00:08:30.601
case history of a woman that I helped with this,

179
00:08:30.601 --> 00:08:33.498
and she was annoyed at her boyfriend because he

180
00:08:33.498 --> 00:08:35.955
wasn't environmentally sensitive.

181
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.634
<v Voiceover>Okay, I can appreciate that. (laughing)</v>

182
00:08:38.634 --> 00:08:40.925
<v ->(laughing) Lot of people, heads are nodding watching this.</v>

183
00:08:40.925 --> 00:08:44.453
So, you start off with an affirmation, and there's

184
00:08:44.453 --> 00:08:47.834
a couple places where you can rub or tap,

185
00:08:47.834 --> 00:08:50.556
one is called a karate chop point, which is right here

186
00:08:50.556 --> 00:08:54.032
at the heel of the hand, another one is a point

187
00:08:54.032 --> 00:08:56.600
a few inches down and out from the collarbone,

188
00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.108
and out towards your shoulder, either or both sides,

189
00:09:01.108 --> 00:09:03.239
and you find a little tender, sore spot,

190
00:09:03.239 --> 00:09:05.919
and you rub that in a circle, or you're

191
00:09:05.919 --> 00:09:07.768
chopping, your karate chop point,

192
00:09:07.768 --> 00:09:09.739
and you say an affirmation, in this case,

193
00:09:09.739 --> 00:09:11.312
the woman said, "Even though I was annoyed

194
00:09:11.312 --> 00:09:14.296
"at the way my boyfriend didn't recycle, I can still

195
00:09:14.296 --> 00:09:16.021
"love and accept myself."

196
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:18.115
That's what we call the basic setup affirmation

197
00:09:18.115 --> 00:09:20.912
where you start, and coming up with an affirmation

198
00:09:20.912 --> 00:09:24.652
can be very helpful to get it specific, okay so ...

199
00:09:24.652 --> 00:09:26.638
<v Voiceover>I'm noticing these aren't the exact points</v>

200
00:09:26.638 --> 00:09:29.136
that you show in your seven.

201
00:09:29.136 --> 00:09:30.725
<v ->Yeah, this is a different point.</v>

202
00:09:30.725 --> 00:09:32.674
We have where there's a collarbone point we're

203
00:09:32.674 --> 00:09:34.545
gonna tap in just a minute, but this is actually

204
00:09:34.545 --> 00:09:37.834
a different, a lymph node spot, so you get a little

205
00:09:37.834 --> 00:09:40.979
extra healing just by doing this, too, and the intent

206
00:09:40.979 --> 00:09:45.013
is very important as well, so she's

207
00:09:45.013 --> 00:09:47.305
remembering that time he didn't recycle, okay.

208
00:09:47.305 --> 00:09:50.588
So you say it three times, that's the classic way,

209
00:09:50.588 --> 00:09:53.562
generally out loud if you can, just to focus.

210
00:09:53.562 --> 00:09:54.942
<v Voiceover>Okay, so she would say...?</v>

211
00:09:54.942 --> 00:09:57.474
<v ->" Even though I was annoyed at the way my boyfriend</v>

212
00:09:57.474 --> 00:09:59.933
"didn't recycle, I can still love and accept myself,

213
00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:02.588
"even though I was annoyed at the way my boyfriend

214
00:10:02.588 --> 00:10:04.684
"didn't recycle, I can still love and accept myself."

215
00:10:04.684 --> 00:10:07.097
You can vary it, "Even though I was really annoyed,

216
00:10:07.097 --> 00:10:10.341
"and couldn't stand the way my boyfriend was insensitive,

217
00:10:10.341 --> 00:10:12.154
I can still love and accept myself."

218
00:10:12.154 --> 00:10:14.654
This isn't set in stone, you kinda get a feeling.

219
00:10:14.654 --> 00:10:15.644
<v Voiceover>So now you've been rubbing that</v>

220
00:10:15.644 --> 00:10:17.058
particular lymph node point.

221
00:10:17.058 --> 00:10:18.749
<v ->Okay, and you did it three times, this is the</v>

222
00:10:18.749 --> 00:10:21.407
classic way to do it, it's not fixed.

223
00:10:21.407 --> 00:10:24.153
Okay, and then you'd start tapping the seven points

224
00:10:24.555 --> 00:10:28.109
with a reminder phrase, a reminder phrase being

225
00:10:28.109 --> 00:10:30.626
this issue or this annoyance, and by the way,

226
00:10:30.626 --> 00:10:34.480
before you do that, it's good to measure the intensity

227
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.198
of the issue, that's sometimes called a SUDS,

228
00:10:37.198 --> 00:10:41.398
or Standard Unit of Distress-Level Self-Assessment.

229
00:10:42.075 --> 00:10:43.341
<v Voiceover>And how do you do that?</v>

230
00:10:43.341 --> 00:10:45.315
<v ->Between one and ten, ten is total,</v>

231
00:10:45.315 --> 00:10:48.037
you'd say, "What is it?", and she said it was about six,

232
00:10:48.037 --> 00:10:51.300
my memory serves me, this annoyance was six out of ten,

233
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.151
and people tend to know it, even if they don't,

234
00:10:53.151 --> 00:10:55.289
they just guess it, they know this.

235
00:10:55.289 --> 00:10:58.347
Okay, so then you tap the seven points, saying the

236
00:10:58.347 --> 00:11:00.321
reminder phrase, you don't have to go through the

237
00:11:00.321 --> 00:11:02.884
long affirmation, you say, "This annoyance..."

238
00:11:02.884 --> 00:11:06.270
and we're tapping the first point by the eyebrow,

239
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.410
sort of the beginning of the eyebrow,

240
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:09.190
you may feel sensitivity,

241
00:11:10.122 --> 00:11:13.158
and then the temple point,

242
00:11:14.459 --> 00:11:17.173
and then under the eyes, these are all correlated

243
00:11:17.173 --> 00:11:19.015
to key acupressure points.
<v Voiceover>now is she</v>

244
00:11:19.015 --> 00:11:21.073
holding a thought at this time, or is she ...

245
00:11:21.073 --> 00:11:24.831
<v ->Each time you say this annoyance, this annoyance,</v>

246
00:11:24.831 --> 00:11:28.238
this annoyance, this annoyance, this is the lower chin,

247
00:11:28.238 --> 00:11:30.174
not the crease or the bottom, right below it,

248
00:11:30.174 --> 00:11:33.231
you'll feel kind of sensitive, and then the collarbone,

249
00:11:33.231 --> 00:11:36.055
there's a bone like a collar underneath your neck,

250
00:11:36.055 --> 00:11:38.722
and there's little ridges underneath that,

251
00:11:38.722 --> 00:11:41.021
there's some little indentations there that might be

252
00:11:41.021 --> 00:11:44.445
tender too, kidney point, kidney meridian point.

253
00:11:44.445 --> 00:11:46.941
Okay, so you're tapping that and saying, "This annoyance,"

254
00:11:46.941 --> 00:11:48.989
and the last point is sort of under the arm

255
00:11:48.989 --> 00:11:53.684
four or five inches, it can be sensitive if you touch it,

256
00:11:53.684 --> 00:11:55.629
but usually you tap with your whole hand,

257
00:11:55.629 --> 00:11:58.971
so you're gonna find it, and you say, "This annoyance."

258
00:11:58.971 --> 00:12:02.396
Obviously that just took a few seconds, could take ...

259
00:12:02.396 --> 00:12:04.230
<v Voiceover>You just say, "This annoyance., nothing else?</v>

260
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.027
<v ->Nothing else, the reason why you say, "This annoyance,"</v>

261
00:12:06.027 --> 00:12:09.066
is you're still focusing on clearing, you're giving your

262
00:12:09.066 --> 00:12:12.124
mind, body the message that you want to clear this,

263
00:12:13.342 --> 00:12:16.101
and it's like clearing the traffic,

264
00:12:16.101 --> 00:12:18.889
you're saying, "We're clearing this convergence

265
00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:21.930
"of major freeways, everyone move here, here, here.",

266
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.288
we're focusing on the task at hand.

267
00:12:24.288 --> 00:12:26.560
Okay, and after you do that, that's one round of the

268
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.999
basic EFT general overhaul standard sequence,

269
00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:36.024
you assess again, and she looked at, she assessed,

270
00:12:36.024 --> 00:12:37.548
and she said, "Hmmm, it's about four now."

271
00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:40.947
So went from six to four, that's about a 30% decrease,

272
00:12:40.947 --> 00:12:43.529
that's good, just one round of tapping in this example.

273
00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:45.795
Sometimes it'll go away in one round, sometimes

274
00:12:45.795 --> 00:12:48.679
amazing, huge things can go away in one round.

275
00:12:48.679 --> 00:12:52.391
Gary calls it "one minute wonders", but that's not

276
00:12:52.391 --> 00:12:54.749
necessarily typical, but it may only take two or three

277
00:12:54.749 --> 00:12:56.546
or four rounds, too.

278
00:12:56.546 --> 00:12:59.615
Okay, now you check back and see if something else

279
00:12:59.615 --> 00:13:02.918
has risen, from this issue.

280
00:13:02.918 --> 00:13:05.153
In other words, is she still simply annoyed

281
00:13:05.153 --> 00:13:08.642
at her boyfriend, and yeah, okay, so if she was,

282
00:13:08.642 --> 00:13:10.672
she can say the affirmation, "Even thought I have some

283
00:13:10.672 --> 00:13:14.056
"remaining annoyance, I still love and accept myself."

284
00:13:14.056 --> 00:13:16.834
or just start tapping and saying, "Remaining annoyance,"

285
00:13:16.834 --> 00:13:19.435
I'm doing the seven points, "Remaining annoyance,

286
00:13:19.435 --> 00:13:21.668
"remaining annoyance, remaining annoyance,"

287
00:13:21.668 --> 00:13:24.109
and it looks kind of strange, "Remaining annoyance,"

288
00:13:24.109 --> 00:13:26.570
"Remaining annoyance, remaining annoyance,"

289
00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.037
and take a deep breath.

290
00:13:28.037 --> 00:13:30.359
Okay, so it went down another two points for her,

291
00:13:30.359 --> 00:13:32.485
so it's down just to two out of six.

292
00:13:33.257 --> 00:13:38.102
And then sometimes you have a little bit,

293
00:13:38.102 --> 00:13:40.484
it may be hard to completely get rid of it in some

294
00:13:40.484 --> 00:13:42.579
people's cases, and that's because there might be

295
00:13:42.579 --> 00:13:45.547
what's called psychological reversal, PR,

296
00:13:45.547 --> 00:13:47.247
psychological reversal.

297
00:13:47.905 --> 00:13:52.073
That's a kind of an underlying, sabotaging belief, in our

298
00:13:52.661 --> 00:13:54.841
emotions, our "Getting Through To Your Emotions" books,

299
00:13:54.841 --> 00:13:59.240
we have a list of common sabotaging beliefs about a problem.

300
00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.073
<v Voiceover>Let's give an example of what might be</v>

301
00:14:01.073 --> 00:14:02.745
underlying that in her case.

302
00:14:02.745 --> 00:14:04.775
<v ->Well, in her case, it was she didn't believe</v>

303
00:14:04.775 --> 00:14:07.638
she could actually get rid of the problem that easily.

304
00:14:07.638 --> 00:14:09.819
<v Voiceover>Uh-huh (affirmative)-, which is a common...</v>

305
00:14:09.819 --> 00:14:10.979
<v ->Common problem.
<v Voiceover>problem in this</v>

306
00:14:10.979 --> 00:14:14.377
culture, which the left brain says, "Eh,

307
00:14:14.377 --> 00:14:15.751
"I can't believe it."

308
00:14:15.751 --> 00:14:17.497
<v ->"I can't believe it.", because if you're not familiar</v>

309
00:14:17.497 --> 00:14:21.006
with these kind of profound, sometimes incredibly

310
00:14:21.006 --> 00:14:23.223
rapid transformational healing techniques that

311
00:14:23.223 --> 00:14:25.993
virtually anyone can do, you might say,

312
00:14:25.993 --> 00:14:29.676
"Well, traditionally it doesn't seem feasible.", you know?

313
00:14:29.676 --> 00:14:31.613
It's like Roger Callahan working with the lady with

314
00:14:31.613 --> 00:14:34.717
the water phobia for a year, and then tapping point

315
00:14:34.717 --> 00:14:37.083
and it's gone, that doesn't sound possible.

316
00:14:37.601 --> 00:14:42.228
So that's a sabotaging belief, or, "I don't want to,

317
00:14:42.228 --> 00:14:44.334
"there's something in me that doesn't really want to.",

318
00:14:44.334 --> 00:14:47.073
or, "I'm not willing to get rid of the problem.",

319
00:14:47.073 --> 00:14:49.411
or, "It's not safe to get rid of the problem.", there's

320
00:14:49.411 --> 00:14:52.745
a series of possibles, there's sort of a checklist

321
00:14:52.745 --> 00:14:56.542
in our books of sabotaging beliefs that you could be

322
00:14:56.542 --> 00:14:58.094
holding onto.

323
00:14:58.094 --> 00:14:59.823
So then you change the affirmation,

324
00:14:59.823 --> 00:15:01.519
remember the affirmation, "Even though I was annoyed

325
00:15:01.519 --> 00:15:03.109
"at my boyfriend"?

326
00:15:03.109 --> 00:15:06.215
You change it to, in her case,

327
00:15:06.215 --> 00:15:07.889
"Even though I don't think it's possible to get rid

328
00:15:07.889 --> 00:15:10.631
"of this problem so easily, I can still love and accept

329
00:15:10.631 --> 00:15:13.456
myself, even though I don't think it's possible.",

330
00:15:13.456 --> 00:15:14.868
because that's another thing ...

331
00:15:14.868 --> 00:15:16.178
<v Voiceover>I would think that would accompany,</v>

332
00:15:16.178 --> 00:15:20.021
be underlying a lot of people's fears, anxieties,

333
00:15:20.021 --> 00:15:21.538
anger, et cetera.

334
00:15:21.538 --> 00:15:25.417
<v ->Absolutely, and after doing this, this belief, or just</v>

335
00:15:25.417 --> 00:15:29.382
saying, "this belief", or "this issue", or, "this problem,"

336
00:15:31.149 --> 00:15:32.701
and then she was fine.

337
00:15:32.701 --> 00:15:34.188
How do you know you're fine?

338
00:15:34.188 --> 00:15:36.200
Well, you're fine when it's neutral,

339
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.391
when it's a non-issue, so ...

340
00:15:39.391 --> 00:15:40.475
<v Voiceover>Has no charge left.</v>

341
00:15:40.475 --> 00:15:41.657
<v ->It has no charge.</v>

342
00:15:42.652 --> 00:15:45.748
Gary Craig and I work with people like post-traumatic

343
00:15:45.748 --> 00:15:48.648
stress, for instance, this can work remarkably well

344
00:15:48.648 --> 00:15:51.922
when, again, all else seems to not do much,

345
00:15:53.315 --> 00:15:56.616
and this Vietnam veteran that I work with,

346
00:15:56.616 --> 00:15:58.225
just thinking back to this case,

347
00:15:58.225 --> 00:16:00.450
and after an hour, there were three different

348
00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.593
post-traumatic stress strains that we cleared,

349
00:16:03.593 --> 00:16:05.933
and the different aspects, the different parts,

350
00:16:05.933 --> 00:16:09.363
because they may go to different, related issues

351
00:16:10.019 --> 00:16:13.565
in different emotional problems related to the one

352
00:16:13.565 --> 00:16:16.148
issue, kind of like peeling the layers of the onion,

353
00:16:16.148 --> 00:16:21.108
deeper ones, and he felt neutral to the same things,

354
00:16:22.146 --> 00:16:24.402
so if you ask him the same, "And when you think about

355
00:16:24.402 --> 00:16:26.851
"that incident in Vietnam, how are you now?"

356
00:16:26.851 --> 00:16:28.298
and you go, "I'm fine."

357
00:16:28.957 --> 00:16:31.034
whereas an hour ago, "I'm very stressed

358
00:16:31.034 --> 00:16:34.399
"and it's very disturbing to me.", because the subconscious

359
00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:37.824
mind is living in a timeless place,

360
00:16:37.824 --> 00:16:40.142
as you may know, so therefore,

361
00:16:40.142 --> 00:16:42.015
it's the same for him in that part that

362
00:16:42.015 --> 00:16:46.187
was in Vietnam 40 years ago as it is today,

363
00:16:47.156 --> 00:16:48.065
it hasn't changed.

364
00:16:48.065 --> 00:16:50.334
<v Voiceover>Right, hasn't changed, I understand,</v>

365
00:16:50.334 --> 00:16:52.670
and that's true of all of us with all of our trauma,

366
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:53.719
from birth forward.

367
00:16:53.719 --> 00:16:57.245
<v ->Yeah, anything, so the neuroscience has shown</v>

368
00:16:57.245 --> 00:16:59.941
that the brain reacts the same way as if it's still

369
00:16:59.941 --> 00:17:03.942
happening, so anywhere where your life isn't working,

370
00:17:04.422 --> 00:17:08.695
EFT is a wonderful tool to start an intervention because,

371
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:11.537
unless you're lucky enough to grow out of it,

372
00:17:11.537 --> 00:17:14.446
it's gonna just stay there, stuck, repressed, and it

373
00:17:14.446 --> 00:17:17.526
could even get worse, and it could go into physical things.

374
00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.821
<v Voiceover>One thing I'm curious about is, in a lot</v>

375
00:17:22.821 --> 00:17:26.450
of the different modalities of self-improvement and

376
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:30.167
healing, when it comes to affirmations,

377
00:17:30.167 --> 00:17:33.328
some schools will say, "You never speak of the problem,

378
00:17:33.328 --> 00:17:36.377
you only speak of the end result, the solution,

379
00:17:36.377 --> 00:17:37.987
and you focus on that."

380
00:17:37.987 --> 00:17:42.298
Here, you're saying to very much bring alive the problem,

381
00:17:42.533 --> 00:17:44.289
can you talk to that for a moment?

382
00:17:44.289 --> 00:17:47.715
<v ->Sure, a good analogy would be, say you have a room</v>

383
00:17:47.715 --> 00:17:50.939
in your house that you'd like to renovate, you'd like to

384
00:17:50.939 --> 00:17:53.332
make it prettier, you'd like to fix up your garage,

385
00:17:53.332 --> 00:17:55.513
that might be (chuckles) a lot of people can relate to it.

386
00:17:55.513 --> 00:17:59.047
So let's say that we just make this room incredibly

387
00:17:59.047 --> 00:18:01.996
beautiful, bring in all the furniture, furnishings you want

388
00:18:01.996 --> 00:18:04.549
and everything, but we don't clean out all the junk.

389
00:18:06.376 --> 00:18:07.581
<v Voiceover>Makes total sense.</v>

390
00:18:07.581 --> 00:18:11.929
<v ->So that's what just sometimes ... I think it's sometimes</v>

391
00:18:11.929 --> 00:18:15.660
a weakness or a blind spot of some New Age approaches

392
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.543
to things where you're just bringing in the light,

393
00:18:17.543 --> 00:18:19.760
and I don't have any inner child problems, and everything

394
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:24.140
is fine, and it doesn't seem to bear out in reality,

395
00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:28.278
it doesn't seem to actually be accurate reality check

396
00:18:28.278 --> 00:18:30.481
for the spiritual path, because part of it is

397
00:18:30.481 --> 00:18:34.783
learning those things, and teaching us things.

398
00:18:34.783 --> 00:18:36.915
<v Voiceover>We did an interview with Hale Dwoskin</v>

399
00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:40.023
of the Sedona Method recently, and he was saying

400
00:18:40.023 --> 00:18:42.923
the exact same thing, you really do have to confront

401
00:18:42.923 --> 00:18:45.538
and deal with the stuff that's in the closet.

402
00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:47.225
<v ->Right, yeah.</v>

403
00:18:47.225 --> 00:18:48.054
<v Voiceover>Before you can start laying any</v>

404
00:18:48.054 --> 00:18:49.347
kind of new foundation.

405
00:18:49.347 --> 00:18:52.310
<v ->Sure, you really need to do both, and that's where,</v>

406
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.813
when my wife and I, who is my partner, Jane,

407
00:18:56.172 --> 00:19:00.776
we realized many decades ago that the spiritual growth,

408
00:19:00.776 --> 00:19:02.764
it was integral to do the healing.

409
00:19:03.769 --> 00:19:05.274
We were at (mumbles) School, and

410
00:19:05.274 --> 00:19:07.471
you would observe negative emotions.

411
00:19:07.471 --> 00:19:09.696
Now, observing negative emotion is good, but not doing

412
00:19:09.696 --> 00:19:12.436
anything to clear them just basically represses them,

413
00:19:12.436 --> 00:19:14.160
and so we had a lot of repressed emotions,

414
00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.009
and people around us, because you were observing

415
00:19:16.009 --> 00:19:17.962
all these things, and you didn't know what to do with it.

416
00:19:17.962 --> 00:19:20.646
It's like a hot potato, just hold it and let it get hot

417
00:19:20.646 --> 00:19:23.882
and burn, and just (mumbles), so it just comes out,

418
00:19:24.568 --> 00:19:28.085
and that stuff stays with you until you do something,

419
00:19:28.085 --> 00:19:31.190
and EFT is one of the most amazing interventions

420
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:34.026
that we have discovered, that has come into

421
00:19:34.683 --> 00:19:39.117
mankind's access, so the reason why it's so popular

422
00:19:39.117 --> 00:19:42.229
is because it works well, and it's very easy.

423
00:19:42.229 --> 00:19:44.763
Men even like it, it's sort of like carpentry work,

424
00:19:44.763 --> 00:19:47.241
just hammering these little points, so it appeals to

425
00:19:47.241 --> 00:19:49.257
the male brain, and the left brain too.

426
00:19:49.257 --> 00:19:50.651
<v Voiceover>Well, it doesn't require a person to go</v>

427
00:19:50.651 --> 00:19:53.076
into an endless meditation that may be

428
00:19:53.076 --> 00:19:54.584
difficult for them to access.

429
00:19:54.584 --> 00:19:56.196
<v ->Correct.</v>

430
00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:57.635
<v Voiceover>It's very direct.</v>

431
00:19:57.635 --> 00:20:00.609
Now, the actual technique, which you showed us in

432
00:20:00.609 --> 00:20:03.491
a couple of minutes (laughing), people can ...

433
00:20:03.491 --> 00:20:06.362
you can find them online with step-by-steps,

434
00:20:06.362 --> 00:20:09.888
and it does seem to be very accessible, very simple.

435
00:20:09.888 --> 00:20:12.734
However, you've written a couple of beautiful books

436
00:20:12.734 --> 00:20:16.683
about EFT, what are you filling the pages with there?

437
00:20:16.683 --> 00:20:19.911
<v ->Right, so what we shared with the viewers is something</v>

438
00:20:19.911 --> 00:20:22.621
that wouldn't take many pages, and you could find it

439
00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:25.380
online or in our books, that's a small part of the books,

440
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.300
just the basic techniques, and there's a lot of

441
00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.824
little subtleties and things keep being discovered,

442
00:20:29.824 --> 00:20:32.404
so people who really would like to learn more about it,

443
00:20:32.404 --> 00:20:36.232
it's well worth studying some of the subtleties and details.

444
00:20:36.232 --> 00:20:39.921
However, to go deeper, which is really our goal,

445
00:20:39.921 --> 00:20:42.539
my wife and I, our goal of helping people fulfill their

446
00:20:42.539 --> 00:20:46.363
potential, requires more depth.

447
00:20:48.196 --> 00:20:52.965
So for instance, one of the techniques in our

448
00:20:54.476 --> 00:20:56.710
"Getting Through To Your Emotions" DVD Two,

449
00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:00.237
the second one, a woman has clutter in her closet,

450
00:21:00.237 --> 00:21:01.828
which many many many people have clutter,

451
00:21:01.828 --> 00:21:04.308
that's a common problem, and it's more than just the

452
00:21:04.308 --> 00:21:07.553
external, of course, there's internal things related,

453
00:21:07.553 --> 00:21:09.704
and we did one of our deeper techniques that we

454
00:21:09.704 --> 00:21:11.167
share in our first book, the

455
00:21:11.167 --> 00:21:13.035
"Getting Through To Your Emotions" book, it's called

456
00:21:13.035 --> 00:21:15.254
"The Breakthrough Process", to break through to

457
00:21:15.254 --> 00:21:18.640
a deeper level, so you combine these deeper guided

458
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.595
visualizations, simple but very elegant, direct,

459
00:21:21.595 --> 00:21:26.242
going deeper in a very soulful, precise way,

460
00:21:27.022 --> 00:21:28.898
accompanying the person's needs,

461
00:21:29.431 --> 00:21:32.069
and she cleared out some emotions from childhood,

462
00:21:32.069 --> 00:21:34.727
some sadness, some things that were repressed,

463
00:21:35.197 --> 00:21:37.447
some things that were stuck from a long time ago,

464
00:21:37.447 --> 00:21:39.525
emotionally, that got represented

465
00:21:39.525 --> 00:21:44.473
externally in her cluttered closet, so after the

466
00:21:44.473 --> 00:21:48.974
video taping of the process in the DVD Two, now,

467
00:21:49.417 --> 00:21:51.317
we asked Carol a few weeks later, "Well Carol,

468
00:21:51.317 --> 00:21:53.066
"how's it going, how's your closet?" and so forth,

469
00:21:53.066 --> 00:21:56.264
she said, "Great, I cleaned out my closet and

470
00:21:56.264 --> 00:21:57.589
"I got a divorce."

471
00:21:57.589 --> 00:21:59.617
<v Voiceover>Oh, goodness, yeah you had better watch</v>

472
00:21:59.617 --> 00:22:01.714
what you ask for, right?

473
00:22:01.714 --> 00:22:03.447
<v ->So we're not saying it's always going to be that</v>

474
00:22:03.447 --> 00:22:07.179
radical, but what it is, it helps you go to the deeper

475
00:22:07.179 --> 00:22:11.350
cores of your life, which, if you really want to progress

476
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:14.453
after a certain point, you have to go further, you have

477
00:22:14.453 --> 00:22:16.726
to embrace yourself at a deeper level.

478
00:22:16.726 --> 00:22:20.493
<v Voiceover>So this really requires a)courage,</v>

479
00:22:20.493 --> 00:22:25.245
and b)a dedication to the pursuit of your own continued

480
00:22:25.245 --> 00:22:26.942
progress and refinement over your life

481
00:22:26.942 --> 00:22:29.402
if you really wanna delve more deeply into this,

482
00:22:29.402 --> 00:22:30.991
is that just what you do in your books?

483
00:22:30.991 --> 00:22:33.313
<v ->Right, in another one of our books,</v>

484
00:22:33.313 --> 00:22:35.076
"Getting Through To Your Soul", which has another

485
00:22:35.076 --> 00:22:37.782
powerful technique called "Spiritual Kinesiology",

486
00:22:37.782 --> 00:22:41.123
just as powerful as EFT, but we talk about, in that book,

487
00:22:41.123 --> 00:22:44.125
the spiritual activations where people grow on the

488
00:22:44.125 --> 00:22:46.900
spiritual path, the ways of defining that, and at a

489
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.850
certain point, people want to become more empowered,

490
00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:52.863
and that becomes their leading drive, some people

491
00:22:52.863 --> 00:22:54.908
watching that, and this is a wonderful way, EFT,

492
00:22:54.908 --> 00:22:57.528
to empower yourself, to find different ways to see,

493
00:22:57.528 --> 00:23:00.878
externally, how your life can fall into place more,

494
00:23:00.878 --> 00:23:04.075
how you can accomplish more, maybe achieve

495
00:23:04.075 --> 00:23:05.832
certain goals more.

496
00:23:06.223 --> 00:23:09.261
After that, it starts to go deeper within,

497
00:23:09.261 --> 00:23:11.441
and you want to find out the areas of yourself

498
00:23:11.441 --> 00:23:13.696
that aren't working, and no longer is tolerable

499
00:23:13.696 --> 00:23:16.108
to ignore, or repress, or deny certain, say,

500
00:23:16.108 --> 00:23:18.689
inner child issues or things that cause you to

501
00:23:18.689 --> 00:23:21.897
act out, act out like a little child,

502
00:23:22.347 --> 00:23:27.245
angry, sad, et cetera, and that deeper embracing

503
00:23:27.245 --> 00:23:30.240
would drive someone to want to clear that,

504
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.371
and the great thing is EFT is such a wonderful tool,

505
00:23:32.371 --> 00:23:34.066
combined with the Getting Through technique,

506
00:23:34.066 --> 00:23:35.794
it's those deeper techniques we write about

507
00:23:35.794 --> 00:23:39.660
in our books, and the CD is very good for self-healing

508
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.892
yourself, the Getting Through Your Motion CD,

509
00:23:41.892 --> 00:23:45.699
so you can just play it, we call it a therapist in the box,

510
00:23:45.699 --> 00:23:47.952
where you just are guided to go deeper, and then at

511
00:23:47.952 --> 00:23:50.412
a certain point when you know deeply what's going on,

512
00:23:50.412 --> 00:23:53.659
then you do the EFT, because the key is not so much ...

513
00:23:53.659 --> 00:23:56.904
the tapping is very easy, understanding the specific,

514
00:23:56.904 --> 00:23:59.768
deep issues can be a little more ...

515
00:23:59.768 --> 00:24:02.794
take a little more probing.

516
00:24:03.507 --> 00:24:05.432
<v Voiceover>Speaking of which, a lot</v>

517
00:24:05.432 --> 00:24:07.452
of these issues for people are painful,

518
00:24:07.452 --> 00:24:10.359
now if you're supposed to be bringing

519
00:24:10.359 --> 00:24:13.536
these feelings forth with clarity as you're

520
00:24:13.536 --> 00:24:17.383
doing this technique, what happens with people

521
00:24:17.383 --> 00:24:19.411
in terms of avoidance, because they don't necessarily

522
00:24:19.411 --> 00:24:22.268
want to go back and feel those things

523
00:24:22.268 --> 00:24:23.702
that they're trying to clear?

524
00:24:23.702 --> 00:24:27.413
<v ->Right, and it seems to be that EFT naturally brings</v>

525
00:24:27.413 --> 00:24:31.203
them up, so say, if a person is saying, "I'm feeling

526
00:24:31.203 --> 00:24:32.980
"kind of strange right now.", just say, "Even though

527
00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:36.583
"I'm feeling kinda strange," and just go through that,

528
00:24:36.583 --> 00:24:38.914
"Even though I'm not sure where this is going."

529
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:41.442
Whatever is on your mind, "Even though I'm afraid

530
00:24:41.442 --> 00:24:43.517
"to find out about this, even though I'm becoming

531
00:24:43.517 --> 00:24:45.608
"very uncomfortable even looking at this,

532
00:24:45.608 --> 00:24:47.442
"I can still love and accept myself."

533
00:24:47.442 --> 00:24:50.166
So whatever comes up, these aspects,

534
00:24:51.001 --> 00:24:54.228
tap on them, and the reason why we have the deeper

535
00:24:54.228 --> 00:24:58.064
Getting Through techniques, it's a very specific road map

536
00:24:58.064 --> 00:25:00.637
to finding out precisely what's going on,

537
00:25:00.637 --> 00:25:03.049
and one of the ones we call "the Holistic Process",

538
00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:07.763
and you map what's going on physically, emotionally,

539
00:25:07.763 --> 00:25:10.755
mentally, spiritually, let me just give you an example,

540
00:25:10.755 --> 00:25:12.941
and this is about buffering things, and men may

541
00:25:12.941 --> 00:25:14.776
have more problem going deeper than women,

542
00:25:14.776 --> 00:25:18.265
just as a general term, not always, because men don't

543
00:25:18.265 --> 00:25:19.751
want to wear their heart on their sleeves,

544
00:25:19.751 --> 00:25:21.865
and they're programmed, especially in the United States,

545
00:25:21.865 --> 00:25:24.868
to be sort of warrior culture type things,

546
00:25:24.868 --> 00:25:26.401
women to a degree, too.

547
00:25:26.401 --> 00:25:29.926
Okay, so the fellow is concerned about confronting

548
00:25:29.926 --> 00:25:34.351
his boss about some issue that he had with the company.

549
00:25:34.351 --> 00:25:38.382
So that was the issue, so on the physical level,

550
00:25:38.382 --> 00:25:41.919
he feels a tension in his third chakra, in his gut,

551
00:25:42.315 --> 00:25:45.037
so that's the physical, it's a holistic process.

552
00:25:45.037 --> 00:25:46.710
Now, what's he feeling emotionally?

553
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:48.302
We say the next question you would ask,

554
00:25:48.302 --> 00:25:49.476
"Well, what's that like emotionally?"

555
00:25:49.476 --> 00:25:52.497
Well, there's some concern, there's some worry,

556
00:25:52.497 --> 00:25:53.474
there's some apprehension.

557
00:25:53.474 --> 00:25:55.268
Okay, so there's some emotion.

558
00:25:55.268 --> 00:25:56.184
<v Voiceover>Fear.</v>

559
00:25:56.184 --> 00:26:00.664
<v ->Fear, and then the third level is the belief,</v>

560
00:26:00.664 --> 00:26:03.951
connected below that is a belief about the world.

561
00:26:03.951 --> 00:26:06.869
Well, what's it like when you're feeling stressed about

562
00:26:06.869 --> 00:26:10.994
talking to your female boss, and

563
00:26:10.994 --> 00:26:13.856
you have that worry, fear, apprehension,

564
00:26:13.856 --> 00:26:15.371
what's the world like?

565
00:26:15.371 --> 00:26:17.783
What do you believe, what's it look like from that place?

566
00:26:17.783 --> 00:26:21.161
Not your entire being, but just when you're in that place.

567
00:26:21.161 --> 00:26:25.612
And Lou said, "Well, it seems like a very limited place.

568
00:26:25.612 --> 00:26:28.984
"It seems like a place that I can't succeed.

569
00:26:28.984 --> 00:26:31.550
"It seems like a place that problems are going to happen,

570
00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:33.760
"It seems very boxed-in and limiting."

571
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:37.056
And the deeper level, the fourth level, is the judgment

572
00:26:37.056 --> 00:26:39.756
level, and this is where it's often very protected.

573
00:26:40.273 --> 00:26:44.699
So at that deeper level, he went into what we call

574
00:26:44.699 --> 00:26:47.059
a buffer, that this is a little roadblock,

575
00:26:47.059 --> 00:26:49.430
a little deviation, sometimes people don't want to

576
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:52.525
feel quite that deeply to respond to your question,

577
00:26:52.892 --> 00:26:55.789
and he popped out of the process, and he said,

578
00:26:55.789 --> 00:26:58.185
"Everything is fine, I can handle it."

579
00:26:58.782 --> 00:27:00.888
Sounds like a good, manly thing to say.

580
00:27:00.888 --> 00:27:02.650
"Right, I can handle that."

581
00:27:03.448 --> 00:27:05.508
True, yes, you can, but we're trying to heal

582
00:27:05.508 --> 00:27:07.968
the wounded part, that's the process of this,

583
00:27:07.968 --> 00:27:11.883
so looking at it deeper, he felt like he might

584
00:27:11.883 --> 00:27:14.660
be a failure, that something's wrong with him.

585
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.796
So what I want the listeners to get right now, to ...

586
00:27:20.958 --> 00:27:23.680
what's the word, defuse so this isn't such a problem,

587
00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.813
this idea of shame, wherever your life isn't working,

588
00:27:27.813 --> 00:27:31.212
there's usually a lot of shame and judgment, maybe always.

589
00:27:32.025 --> 00:27:33.254
<v Voiceover>And that's why it's necessary</v>

590
00:27:33.254 --> 00:27:34.669
to go through that part.

591
00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:37.232
<v ->It might, it might be necessary to go that deep,</v>

592
00:27:37.232 --> 00:27:41.253
just to totally get it and heal it, it's like the child's

593
00:27:41.253 --> 00:27:43.105
crying and wounded in the corner, and is feeling

594
00:27:43.105 --> 00:27:46.485
terrible and like it's no good, you have to go there

595
00:27:46.485 --> 00:27:49.049
and embrace the child, and really love the child,

596
00:27:49.049 --> 00:27:51.559
and go maybe the whole distance.

597
00:27:51.559 --> 00:27:53.090
We're not talking about much time if you follow

598
00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:55.866
this holistic process, it's just written out in the

599
00:27:55.866 --> 00:27:58.364
books and the CD, so just follow, listen to the CD,

600
00:27:58.364 --> 00:27:59.866
and it'll ask you the questions.

601
00:28:00.505 --> 00:28:02.953
Or watch it in the DVD, how to do it.

602
00:28:02.953 --> 00:28:06.407
So at that point, he could just say whatever affirmation

603
00:28:06.407 --> 00:28:09.063
fit that, "Even though I feel like I might be a failure,

604
00:28:09.063 --> 00:28:11.857
even though I'm afraid to confront my boss,"

605
00:28:11.857 --> 00:28:15.020
whatever, but he knows now deeply what it is in the core.

606
00:28:15.519 --> 00:28:18.413
So at that point, he can really clear deeply,

607
00:28:18.413 --> 00:28:20.228
instead of just doing the EFT and saying, "Even though

608
00:28:20.228 --> 00:28:22.708
"I have this fear to confront my boss."

609
00:28:22.708 --> 00:28:24.278
and that's why a lot of people who read our

610
00:28:24.278 --> 00:28:25.411
books and stuff say, "Gee whiz,

611
00:28:25.411 --> 00:28:28.248
"I've tried EFT and it doesn't work.", but they

612
00:28:28.248 --> 00:28:30.387
haven't done the deeper Getting Through techniques,

613
00:28:30.387 --> 00:28:32.416
so they come to us individually for a phone session

614
00:28:32.416 --> 00:28:35.803
or whatever to really get at the core issues.

615
00:28:35.803 --> 00:28:37.673
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm (Affirmative)-, walk them through it.</v>

616
00:28:37.673 --> 00:28:40.174
<v ->But they can do it a lot of times just on the CD</v>

617
00:28:40.174 --> 00:28:42.652
or reading the steps in the book, just follow along,

618
00:28:42.652 --> 00:28:44.794
that's why, partly, we wrote it.

619
00:28:44.794 --> 00:28:46.628
<v Voiceover>How much of the fear that people are</v>

620
00:28:46.628 --> 00:28:49.346
experiencing, because I assume there's basically

621
00:28:49.346 --> 00:28:51.160
love and there's fear that, when you're getting

622
00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.322
underneath everything, you got just a couple of

623
00:28:53.322 --> 00:28:55.211
really, really powerful forces going on,

624
00:28:55.211 --> 00:28:57.989
so let's say that a lot of this has to do with fear

625
00:28:57.989 --> 00:29:01.533
on some level, even anger has to do with fear.

626
00:29:01.533 --> 00:29:06.393
How is the fear of change, meaning, "I've come here,

627
00:29:06.393 --> 00:29:08.624
"Yes, I'd like to get a little bit of help because I don't

628
00:29:08.624 --> 00:29:10.037
wanna feel this way any more.",

629
00:29:10.037 --> 00:29:13.467
but what percentage of ... how often do you see

630
00:29:13.467 --> 00:29:16.116
that yes, people want to change as long as it's easy,

631
00:29:16.116 --> 00:29:18.771
and it's quick, it's not too uncomfortable,

632
00:29:18.771 --> 00:29:20.396
and it's not major?

633
00:29:20.396 --> 00:29:23.258
What happens when it turns out all of your feelings

634
00:29:23.258 --> 00:29:26.885
are predicated on something, as you say, much deeper?

635
00:29:27.627 --> 00:29:29.710
<v ->Well, it's really easy if you have</v>

636
00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:32.853
the right vehicle and the right context.

637
00:29:32.853 --> 00:29:35.548
So if someone came to me, or really read our books

638
00:29:35.548 --> 00:29:38.523
or things, and wanted to go deeper, it's all there.

639
00:29:38.523 --> 00:29:41.040
There's a roadmap of easy and elegantly,

640
00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.312
and there's ways of getting support not only from

641
00:29:43.312 --> 00:29:45.165
the materials, but they could go into, visually,

642
00:29:45.165 --> 00:29:47.194
the people or talk to people who know EFT, it's

643
00:29:47.194 --> 00:29:50.027
so widespread, so there are support networks

644
00:29:50.027 --> 00:29:51.652
on a lot of different levels.

645
00:29:52.366 --> 00:29:56.483
So, I think the challenge is, previously,

646
00:29:56.483 --> 00:29:58.115
"What would I do? How would I do it?

647
00:29:58.115 --> 00:30:00.931
"How would I get help? What am I going to find?"

648
00:30:00.931 --> 00:30:03.190
If someone says, "Well, here's a roadmap,

649
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:04.706
"here are guides to help you."

650
00:30:04.706 --> 00:30:06.973
and it's completely reasonable, in fact, your life will

651
00:30:06.973 --> 00:30:10.883
work a lot better without all these fears cracking you down,

652
00:30:10.883 --> 00:30:13.141
there's a lot of incentive to go further.

653
00:30:13.141 --> 00:30:14.844
<v Voiceover>I agree with that, but then, like the woman</v>

654
00:30:14.844 --> 00:30:17.061
who cleared the clutter and got rid of a husband too,

655
00:30:17.061 --> 00:30:19.418
you have to be ready for the repercussions of really

656
00:30:19.418 --> 00:30:21.497
opening the Pandora's Box.

657
00:30:21.497 --> 00:30:24.047
<v ->Well, it could be opening ...</v>

658
00:30:24.047 --> 00:30:27.226
Opening the Pandora's Box is like saying the shadow.

659
00:30:27.226 --> 00:30:31.593
The shadow is already operating, so it's really shining

660
00:30:31.593 --> 00:30:33.469
light on what's really happening, and where

661
00:30:33.469 --> 00:30:35.683
your life isn't working, so going back to the

662
00:30:35.683 --> 00:30:38.339
all the shame-faced stuff that, where our life

663
00:30:38.339 --> 00:30:41.772
doesn't work, it's already there, and once you're

664
00:30:41.772 --> 00:30:45.089
at that spiritual place, you want to go further.

665
00:30:45.089 --> 00:30:46.543
If you don't want to go further, you're not even

666
00:30:46.543 --> 00:30:48.219
probably watching this.

667
00:30:49.314 --> 00:30:50.355
<v Voiceover>This is very true.</v>

668
00:30:50.355 --> 00:30:52.643
<v ->This is going to be of very cursory interest</v>

669
00:30:52.643 --> 00:30:55.628
to the person, but if you really want to go deeper,

670
00:30:55.628 --> 00:30:56.676
here are tools, and here are the path,

671
00:30:56.676 --> 00:30:59.590
and at a certain point it's almost hard not to,

672
00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:02.697
so it's a natural place, and this is a great way to do it.

673
00:31:02.697 --> 00:31:06.616
<v Voiceover>And that is very true, I think most everybody</v>

674
00:31:06.616 --> 00:31:08.944
watching this interview shares one thing in common,

675
00:31:08.944 --> 00:31:12.012
if they've arrived at our site, they're probably ready for

676
00:31:12.012 --> 00:31:14.582
a shift in thinking or change, and this certainly sounds

677
00:31:14.582 --> 00:31:17.043
like a profound vehicle in which to

678
00:31:17.043 --> 00:31:19.504
start stimulating that kind of change in your life.

679
00:31:19.504 --> 00:31:21.497
Is there any kind of final thought you want to

680
00:31:21.497 --> 00:31:23.920
share with us in wrapping up, or a story that's

681
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.539
particularly special to you before

682
00:31:27.539 --> 00:31:29.400
we sign off here?

683
00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:33.890
<v ->Well, I think I feel really blessed that we came across</v>

684
00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:36.336
the EFT, it was kind of miraculous, the things that've

685
00:31:36.336 --> 00:31:38.796
come our way by following your deeper purpose,

686
00:31:38.796 --> 00:31:41.189
which is really our purpose to help people follow

687
00:31:41.189 --> 00:31:44.510
their deeper purpose, and to have that

688
00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:48.085
have a vehicle like EFT to clear things is really

689
00:31:48.085 --> 00:31:50.218
a miracle, a blessing for everyone that

690
00:31:50.218 --> 00:31:52.723
anyone can do it, children have gotten remarkable

691
00:31:52.723 --> 00:31:55.848
results, too, so the whole face of the world will change,

692
00:31:55.848 --> 00:31:59.757
because if we want change, if peace indeed is the way,

693
00:31:59.757 --> 00:32:02.185
we need to start inside, as we know,

694
00:32:02.185 --> 00:32:03.530
so how do you start inside?

695
00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:06.363
Well, this is one of the best ways you can start within

696
00:32:06.363 --> 00:32:09.740
easily, inexpensively,

697
00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.610
very effectively, so it's well worth,

698
00:32:13.967 --> 00:32:16.760
I think, investing any time or effort into it, because the

699
00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.761
results are pretty extraordinary, as virtually millions

700
00:32:19.761 --> 00:32:22.449
of people around the world now know.

701
00:32:22.449 --> 00:32:23.484
