00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.806
<v ->Maori elderwoman Rose Pere brings people to their knees</v>

2
00:00:03.806 --> 00:00:06.706
and to their feet in applause when she speaks her truth.

3
00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:08.326
She has been bestowed many honors

4
00:00:08.326 --> 00:00:10.008
from cultures around the world,

5
00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:11.508
including from the Queen of England

6
00:00:11.508 --> 00:00:13.728
and as an awe-inspiring representative

7
00:00:13.728 --> 00:00:16.037
of the indigenous people of New Zealand.

8
00:00:16.037 --> 00:00:17.877
It has been her life's mission to preserve

9
00:00:17.877 --> 00:00:20.457
and perpetuate the wisdom of the Maori way

10
00:00:20.457 --> 00:00:22.817
and their uniquely respectful relationship

11
00:00:22.817 --> 00:00:24.337
to all living things.

12
00:00:24.337 --> 00:00:27.097
One trait that she says is prized among their people

13
00:00:27.097 --> 00:00:30.417
is their historical ability to use sight and intuition

14
00:00:30.417 --> 00:00:32.527
to navigate through life.

15
00:00:41.457 --> 00:00:43.077
I listened to you this morning and I found it

16
00:00:43.077 --> 00:00:45.497
absolutely amazing that here this,

17
00:00:45.497 --> 00:00:49.427
what are you, maybe five feet tall,

18
00:00:49.427 --> 00:00:51.617
this woman stands up before this group,

19
00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:54.337
not even on the stage and scared

20
00:00:54.337 --> 00:00:56.437
the begeezus out of everybody.

21
00:00:56.437 --> 00:00:58.097
(laughter)

22
00:00:58.097 --> 00:01:00.997
What is it that people are so afraid of hearing

23
00:01:00.997 --> 00:01:03.767
one woman speak her complete truth?

24
00:01:04.857 --> 00:01:08.237
<v ->Well I guess it depends on what the one's</v>

25
00:01:08.237 --> 00:01:10.577
cultural background is.

26
00:01:10.577 --> 00:01:15.117
For us, the Maori, we are a warrior race of people.

27
00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:20.117
And we stand up and we make sure that people

28
00:01:20.717 --> 00:01:25.337
understand and know exactly what we are all about.

29
00:01:25.337 --> 00:01:30.337
We do not pretend to be anything else but ourselves

30
00:01:30.357 --> 00:01:35.357
because for us, we are miracles in expression.

31
00:01:36.037 --> 00:01:39.557
We have both the divine in us as well as

32
00:01:39.557 --> 00:01:42.935
the beautiful human side of us.

33
00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:46.455
And so when I stand up, I stand up,

34
00:01:46.455 --> 00:01:48.275
and I stand up tall.

35
00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:50.955
<v Regina>Boy do you, and it actually,</v>

36
00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:52.935
I noticed myself and other people in the room,

37
00:01:52.935 --> 00:01:55.875
just your doing that, something permeated the room

38
00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:59.475
that actually brings tears to our eyes

39
00:01:59.475 --> 00:02:01.695
because we're so afraid of standing up

40
00:02:01.695 --> 00:02:04.215
and being who we are, myself included.

41
00:02:04.215 --> 00:02:05.275
<v ->No we're not.</v>

42
00:02:05.275 --> 00:02:08.415
For us, we're fearless people.

43
00:02:08.415 --> 00:02:13.415
We only can afford to have fear for 20 seconds.

44
00:02:13.515 --> 00:02:16.095
After that, you must have complete control

45
00:02:16.095 --> 00:02:18.775
over your situation, and it doesn't matter

46
00:02:18.775 --> 00:02:22.335
what sort of situation you find yourself in.

47
00:02:22.335 --> 00:02:24.815
You have to be fearless.

48
00:02:24.815 --> 00:02:27.535
You also need to understand that the Maori,

49
00:02:27.535 --> 00:02:30.395
we are the fastest ghostbusters on the planet.

50
00:02:30.395 --> 00:02:31.275
(laughter)

51
00:02:31.275 --> 00:02:31.915
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>

52
00:02:31.915 --> 00:02:35.115
<v ->And other people ask us to clear negative energy,</v>

53
00:02:35.115 --> 00:02:37.955
we're the fastest at doing that,

54
00:02:37.955 --> 00:02:41.695
and that is because we don't waste time meditating.

55
00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:44.515
We don't waste time praying because we're

56
00:02:44.515 --> 00:02:48.095
gods and goddesses anyway, and we go straight into it.

57
00:02:48.095 --> 00:02:49.495
<v Regina>So do you just, you just</v>

58
00:02:49.495 --> 00:02:54.495
<v ->We attack the energy and we tell it to go, finished.</v>

59
00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:56.495
There's no nonsense.

60
00:02:56.495 --> 00:02:57.595
<v Regina>And there's also an element,</v>

61
00:02:57.595 --> 00:02:59.095
even though you don't go into meditation,

62
00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:02.415
with yourself, for example, you're also a seer.

63
00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:03.755
<v ->That's right.</v>

64
00:03:03.755 --> 00:03:06.155
<v Regina>And so how does this element</v>

65
00:03:06.155 --> 00:03:07.875
come into the people, the Maori people?

66
00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:12.295
<v ->When you say a seer, for us it's just natural.</v>

67
00:03:12.295 --> 00:03:16.435
It is natural for us to have a second sight.

68
00:03:16.435 --> 00:03:19.575
It is natural for us to have intuitive intelligence

69
00:03:19.575 --> 00:03:21.775
at a very high level.

70
00:03:21.775 --> 00:03:25.295
King Farouk, during the second world war,

71
00:03:25.295 --> 00:03:28.215
got the Maori battalion to guard his palace

72
00:03:28.215 --> 00:03:33.215
because he maintained that we had intuitive intelligence

73
00:03:33.675 --> 00:03:35.435
at a very high level,

74
00:03:35.435 --> 00:03:38.395
that his own people had lost it.

75
00:03:38.395 --> 00:03:40.475
And that's what I'm talking about.

76
00:03:40.475 --> 00:03:42.955
The whole of humanity has this,

77
00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:46.555
but it's being repressed in some cultures.

78
00:03:46.555 --> 00:03:48.735
It has been repressed, and when you think about

79
00:03:48.735 --> 00:03:53.735
17 million women being exterminated at the stake

80
00:03:53.995 --> 00:03:58.055
during the Inquisition, it is no wonder

81
00:03:58.055 --> 00:03:59.815
some people are fearful.

82
00:03:59.815 --> 00:04:00.575
<v Regina>I see this.</v>

83
00:04:00.575 --> 00:04:02.955
<v ->But not for us, the Maori, no.</v>

84
00:04:02.955 --> 00:04:04.095
<v Regina>This is very true.</v>

85
00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:06.155
I see this in a lot of powerful women.

86
00:04:06.155 --> 00:04:07.455
I've interviewed many powerful women,

87
00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:11.355
but even inside, there's still this remnant of fear

88
00:04:11.355 --> 00:04:14.395
that if you come out and say what you really mean

89
00:04:14.395 --> 00:04:16.035
and be really who you truly are,

90
00:04:16.035 --> 00:04:18.075
that there's some repercussion.

91
00:04:18.075 --> 00:04:21.455
<v ->Well I'm telling you that I can only afford</v>

92
00:04:21.455 --> 00:04:23.295
to have fear for 20 seconds.

93
00:04:23.295 --> 00:04:25.355
After that, it's either you or me mate,

94
00:04:25.355 --> 00:04:26.615
and it's not going to be me.

95
00:04:26.615 --> 00:04:27.255
(laughter)

96
00:04:27.255 --> 00:04:30.915
<v Regina>I can tell it's not going to be you.</v>

97
00:04:30.915 --> 00:04:33.995
Let's talk about what happened to your people

98
00:04:33.995 --> 00:04:37.295
in your own life when the missionaries came

99
00:04:37.295 --> 00:04:38.535
with all their great knowledge.

100
00:04:38.535 --> 00:04:39.815
<v ->God bless them.</v>

101
00:04:39.815 --> 00:04:41.935
God bless them, you know?

102
00:04:43.685 --> 00:04:46.895
When the Europeans first came down to us,

103
00:04:46.895 --> 00:04:50.615
we knew that a lot of them came from the part

104
00:04:50.615 --> 00:04:54.575
of our mother that is the heart chakra.

105
00:04:54.575 --> 00:04:56.895
Therefore, we embraced them.

106
00:04:56.895 --> 00:05:01.895
They assumed that they were talking about S-U-N, Rah.

107
00:05:03.275 --> 00:05:05.655
The other thing is that they realized that the missionaries

108
00:05:05.655 --> 00:05:09.475
were not speaking about the divine mother.

109
00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:14.475
They only spoke about the Father, the child, or the Son,

110
00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:16.815
and the Holy Ghost.

111
00:05:16.815 --> 00:05:21.275
So our people have hidden mother energy

112
00:05:21.275 --> 00:05:25.455
from the missionaries, we project a Christian

113
00:05:25.455 --> 00:05:28.935
or Roman Catholic image, whatever up front,

114
00:05:28.935 --> 00:05:33.935
but we practice our own religion, rituals.

115
00:05:34.735 --> 00:05:37.075
And that is how we have been able to retain

116
00:05:37.075 --> 00:05:39.815
our own power and our own energy

117
00:05:39.815 --> 00:05:42.655
because we've kept people off the ancient path

118
00:05:42.655 --> 00:05:47.655
that we have trodden, that has special signposts.

119
00:05:47.835 --> 00:05:49.475
<v Regina>What was your own experience</v>

120
00:05:49.475 --> 00:05:51.735
starting at a young age when they came?

121
00:05:51.735 --> 00:05:53.735
How did this impact your life?

122
00:05:53.735 --> 00:05:58.735
<v ->Well the first thing I struck with western thinking</v>

123
00:05:59.535 --> 00:06:04.535
was that there was no respect for our family

124
00:06:04.715 --> 00:06:07.015
such as the animals.

125
00:06:07.015 --> 00:06:09.735
They spoke about filthy pigs.

126
00:06:09.735 --> 00:06:14.735
We would never describe an animal as being filthy, ever.

127
00:06:15.795 --> 00:06:20.795
They spoke about terrible days.

128
00:06:21.035 --> 00:06:24.075
We don't know what that means.

129
00:06:24.075 --> 00:06:25.755
Every day is perfect.

130
00:06:25.755 --> 00:06:28.995
Every day is precious.

131
00:06:28.995 --> 00:06:32.335
For us, the miracle is called "hatinotanga"

132
00:06:32.335 --> 00:06:35.493
which means an absolute treasure.

133
00:06:35.493 --> 00:06:38.933
So that if someone comes to join you at the table,

134
00:06:38.933 --> 00:06:43.933
like a bee or a fly, that in itself is an absolute treasure.

135
00:06:46.513 --> 00:06:49.052
Therefore, that is a miracle.

136
00:06:49.052 --> 00:06:51.013
That's how we see it.

137
00:06:51.013 --> 00:06:53.532
We do not separate ourselves from the oneness

138
00:06:53.532 --> 00:06:55.673
of everything that exists.

139
00:06:55.673 --> 00:06:57.813
We are lucky to be here under the trees.

140
00:06:57.813 --> 00:07:01.393
I'm so pleased because they are very special

141
00:07:01.393 --> 00:07:04.293
relations to us.

142
00:07:04.293 --> 00:07:09.293
They have done breathing for so long for humanity,

143
00:07:09.692 --> 00:07:11.673
and do we appreciate it?

144
00:07:11.673 --> 00:07:16.673
No, we cut down huge forests, huge forests.

145
00:07:16.893 --> 00:07:18.653
How can we do that?

146
00:07:18.653 --> 00:07:21.212
How can we be so stupid?

147
00:07:21.212 --> 00:07:23.653
<v Regina>I don't know.</v>

148
00:07:23.653 --> 00:07:27.333
<v ->In my world, we have care of all the birds.</v>

149
00:07:27.333 --> 00:07:29.673
We replenish the bird numbers by

150
00:07:29.673 --> 00:07:31.772
keeping down the snakes and weasels,

151
00:07:31.772 --> 00:07:35.772
which were introduced into our country.

152
00:07:35.772 --> 00:07:39.993
We replenish, and we also regenerate.

153
00:07:39.993 --> 00:07:42.039
Okay, hold on, a little mite.

154
00:07:43.348 --> 00:07:45.149
<v Regina>A little insect coming to visit.</v>

155
00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:46.649
<v ->That's right.</v>

156
00:07:46.649 --> 00:07:49.327
Uh "kiorakuay".

157
00:07:49.327 --> 00:07:52.233
We also, it doesn't matter what we're talking about.

158
00:07:52.233 --> 00:07:54.713
We are one with the universe.

159
00:07:54.713 --> 00:07:57.353
We are one with everything that exists.

160
00:07:57.353 --> 00:08:00.513
And so we take good care of people,

161
00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:04.913
but certainly everything else that we have

162
00:08:04.913 --> 00:08:07.293
because we're all related.

163
00:08:07.293 --> 00:08:09.773
<v Regina>What is your personal lineage</v>

164
00:08:09.773 --> 00:08:11.833
within all of this, with your ancestors,

165
00:08:11.833 --> 00:08:14.351
and your place in society now?

166
00:08:14.351 --> 00:08:17.271
<v ->My lineage, I come from ancient lines.</v>

167
00:08:17.271 --> 00:08:21.851
I can go back over 220 generations,

168
00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:25.651
back to when ancient Hawaiki was one whole continent

169
00:08:25.651 --> 00:08:28.411
which is over 12,000 years ago.

170
00:08:28.411 --> 00:08:31.271
We have idiots who have said how can you do that?

171
00:08:31.271 --> 00:08:35.071
I said we can, and that is what you need to realize,

172
00:08:35.071 --> 00:08:38.411
that the Maori were well known for being able

173
00:08:38.411 --> 00:08:40.051
to trace our ancestry back.

174
00:08:40.051 --> 00:08:43.671
We are one of the few peoples in the world who can do that.

175
00:08:43.671 --> 00:08:46.851
We can recite 5,000 names off.

176
00:08:46.851 --> 00:08:49.671
How many people can do that?

177
00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:55.492
So I come from an ancient line of people.

178
00:08:55.492 --> 00:08:59.612
A people who have always linked in with

179
00:08:59.612 --> 00:09:02.952
the central sun, the divine spot.

180
00:09:02.952 --> 00:09:07.952
A people who have always seen the divine in ourselves,

181
00:09:09.272 --> 00:09:12.006
and that's how we see other people.

182
00:09:12.006 --> 00:09:14.006
We see other people as all esteemed.

183
00:09:14.006 --> 00:09:16.006
It doesn't matter what culture they come from,

184
00:09:16.006 --> 00:09:18.466
what country they come from.

185
00:09:18.466 --> 00:09:23.346
We see them as all esteemed people as the living breath

186
00:09:23.346 --> 00:09:26.746
from the central sun, the divine spot.

187
00:09:26.746 --> 00:09:31.746
Our word Ra, ranatira, ordinary meaning is team person.

188
00:09:33.566 --> 00:09:37.666
Sacred meaning Ra, we begin with the sun,

189
00:09:37.666 --> 00:09:41.724
nati, living breath, and we end with Ra.

190
00:09:41.724 --> 00:09:44.604
Ranatira.

191
00:09:44.604 --> 00:09:46.644
That's how we are.

192
00:09:46.644 --> 00:09:49.404
A very ancient people.

193
00:09:49.404 --> 00:09:52.624
So when our aboriginal brothers and sisters

194
00:09:52.624 --> 00:09:56.924
say to us they are the most ancient of the peoples,

195
00:09:56.924 --> 00:10:01.924
we say to them hush, hush, we are all ancient beings.

196
00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:07.504
I will say to you, my aboriginal brothers and sisters,

197
00:10:07.504 --> 00:10:12.304
I chose to be an Aborigine before the white man came.

198
00:10:13.794 --> 00:10:17.424
<v Regina>And not to harp, not to belabor the point,</v>

199
00:10:17.424 --> 00:10:19.344
but when the white man did come,

200
00:10:19.344 --> 00:10:23.044
how, in your own personal experience,

201
00:10:23.044 --> 00:10:25.744
your family's experience, your people's experience,

202
00:10:25.744 --> 00:10:27.304
how did this affect your lives?

203
00:10:27.304 --> 00:10:29.514
<v ->We, the Maori, didn't put up with any nonsense.</v>

204
00:10:31.754 --> 00:10:35.684
For me and our family, we've always withstood any,

205
00:10:35.684 --> 00:10:40.004
and so there's a great respect for us as a people.

206
00:10:40.004 --> 00:10:43.044
Our white brothers and sisters love us.

207
00:10:43.044 --> 00:10:44.564
We can squabble.

208
00:10:44.564 --> 00:10:47.284
We can bicker, but at the end of the day,

209
00:10:47.284 --> 00:10:52.284
we are one family with unique members within the family.

210
00:10:54.364 --> 00:10:58.304
So it's not as if they can trick, no they don't do that.

211
00:10:58.304 --> 00:11:01.084
You know that the Maori, our language is the

212
00:11:01.084 --> 00:11:03.004
official language of New Zealand.

213
00:11:03.004 --> 00:11:04.344
<v Regina>That's amazing, wonderful.</v>

214
00:11:04.344 --> 00:11:05.684
<v ->Where else would you get that?</v>

215
00:11:05.684 --> 00:11:08.264
So what does it tell people?

216
00:11:08.264 --> 00:11:12.704
It tells people that as a race of people,

217
00:11:12.704 --> 00:11:17.064
we have never, people have never been able to swallow us up.

218
00:11:17.064 --> 00:11:22.064
No because we've always protected our own interests.

219
00:11:22.884 --> 00:11:26.624
The other thing is that we can see a lot more

220
00:11:26.624 --> 00:11:29.144
than what people think.

221
00:11:29.144 --> 00:11:32.104
And so for us, people who have chosen to be

222
00:11:32.104 --> 00:11:35.844
white New Zealanders today, they are special people

223
00:11:35.844 --> 00:11:39.124
because they've chosen to come in at the right time.

224
00:11:39.124 --> 00:11:40.944
<v Regina>Why do you say the right time?</v>

225
00:11:40.944 --> 00:11:45.944
<v ->Because of the mother energy coming back in full force.</v>

226
00:11:46.324 --> 00:11:51.324
All the portals have opened up in terms of mother energy.

227
00:11:52.464 --> 00:11:56.564
I will say to pakeha New Zealanders, white New Zealanders.

228
00:11:56.564 --> 00:11:59.682
you have chosen the right time to come back in

229
00:11:59.682 --> 00:12:03.742
as a New Zealander.

230
00:12:03.742 --> 00:12:06.742
<v Regina>You come to, here we're in Boulder, Colorado,</v>

231
00:12:06.742 --> 00:12:10.042
at an energy healing conference and you are probably

232
00:12:10.042 --> 00:12:12.682
the most esteemed guest here at the invitation

233
00:12:12.682 --> 00:12:14.682
of the organizers.

234
00:12:14.682 --> 00:12:18.342
You receive a standing ovation each time you speak.

235
00:12:18.342 --> 00:12:20.342
You bring a power that people aren't accustomed

236
00:12:20.342 --> 00:12:23.082
to being around personally, a personal power.

237
00:12:23.082 --> 00:12:27.242
You bring this to us, but I would like to know also

238
00:12:27.242 --> 00:12:29.622
well, two things, first how do you experience it

239
00:12:29.622 --> 00:12:32.542
when you come in to the United States,

240
00:12:32.542 --> 00:12:36.383
into this kind of space and land and people,

241
00:12:36.383 --> 00:12:38.782
with everything, no holds barred.

242
00:12:38.782 --> 00:12:39.962
What happens to you?

243
00:12:39.962 --> 00:12:41.222
What do you feel?

244
00:12:43.182 --> 00:12:46.062
<v ->I must say that when I came in,</v>

245
00:12:46.062 --> 00:12:50.662
on a spiritual level, I was embraced by the eagle.

246
00:12:50.662 --> 00:12:55.002
I was embraced by the first nations people of this land.

247
00:12:55.002 --> 00:13:00.002
That, well it enables me, and it reinforces

248
00:13:00.002 --> 00:13:02.682
the reason why I'm here,

249
00:13:02.682 --> 00:13:07.662
which is to remind people that we're all divine beings,

250
00:13:07.662 --> 00:13:12.662
that no one is more superior or more divine than another,

251
00:13:13.302 --> 00:13:18.302
and that it is time for us to remember how important it is

252
00:13:18.662 --> 00:13:23.102
to love each other unconditionally,

253
00:13:23.102 --> 00:13:27.312
and not to come in with powertization and control

254
00:13:27.312 --> 00:13:31.042
over food, fuel, and water.

255
00:13:31.042 --> 00:13:35.262
No, not only that.

256
00:13:35.262 --> 00:13:40.262
People in the United States need to link in to our mother,

257
00:13:40.802 --> 00:13:42.562
(Maori term)

258
00:13:42.562 --> 00:13:47.302
because we all have that energy within us.

259
00:13:47.302 --> 00:13:50.862
We had to remember how to do it sometimes,

260
00:13:50.862 --> 00:13:52.742
how to touch her.

261
00:13:52.742 --> 00:13:57.062
We massage her when we do posture dances.

262
00:13:57.062 --> 00:14:01.082
when we stand on her (Maori chant),

263
00:14:01.082 --> 00:14:06.082
but we're massaging her with our feet, not with sprigs.

264
00:14:07.482 --> 00:14:08.442
<v Regina>Beautiful.</v>

265
00:14:08.442 --> 00:14:13.202
<v ->But massaging her with our bare feet, for our mother.</v>

266
00:14:13.202 --> 00:14:15.042
<v Regina>And she feeds us through our feet.</v>

267
00:14:15.042 --> 00:14:17.302
<v ->Of course she does.</v>

268
00:14:17.302 --> 00:14:21.902
And we link into her as our mother.

269
00:14:21.902 --> 00:14:24.022
That's on a physical level.

270
00:14:24.022 --> 00:14:27.422
On a spiritual level, we have a divine mother,

271
00:14:27.422 --> 00:14:30.382
and I'm not speaking about Mary.

272
00:14:30.382 --> 00:14:33.462
I'm speaking about divine mother from

273
00:14:33.462 --> 00:14:37.002
the central sun, divine spot.

274
00:14:37.002 --> 00:14:39.022
<v Regina>What is your observation when you look at,</v>

275
00:14:39.022 --> 00:14:40.902
when you say I'm not speaking of Mary,

276
00:14:40.902 --> 00:14:44.942
I'm speaking of our divine mother, our sustenance,

277
00:14:44.942 --> 00:14:47.882
as you look around the world with your vision,

278
00:14:47.882 --> 00:14:51.462
what do you see the formal religions having

279
00:14:51.462 --> 00:14:54.230
contributed to our planet?

280
00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:01.320
<v ->Well religions, look at the battles for goodness sake,</v>

281
00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.120
and a lot of them are religious battles.

282
00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.480
And it's very sad.

283
00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.440
All I can feel for other families across the world.

284
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.580
I have said to our brothers and sisters in Israel,

285
00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.520
you, the Palestinians, and the Israelis,

286
00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.580
you both come from Abraham, what's going on here?

287
00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:29.420
You see, our people, we do not have a word for enemy.

288
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:34.720
The closest we have to that word is "hehoalidi",

289
00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:40.160
which means quarrelsome friend, but only for a time.

290
00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.560
So that was the Germans and we fought

291
00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.900
against them in two world wars.

292
00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.400
They are still family.

293
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.520
And when our retired servicemen go across

294
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:55.440
overseas, to cry over sometimes the dead

295
00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.680
that we have left in Europe, in Galipoli,

296
00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.200
they also cry for the German dead,

297
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.200
and they remember the mothers of those soldiers.

298
00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:12.020
When I went on a nature tour through Germany,

299
00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:17.020
look it was packed because they knew a Maori was coming.

300
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:24.680
We are a legend in the middle East, through Europe, Germany,

301
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Italy, because the Maori has always been straight up.

302
00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:35.240
What the Maori battalion said to the German army was

303
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.660
if you hear us doing our war dance,

304
00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.920
you know, and if you got any guts,

305
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.040
you will know that we have run out of ammunition

306
00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:48.400
and you should come in at us with your bayonets.

307
00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.640
An understanding between two races of people.

308
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.640
So that for me, all we're trying to say is no, we are one.

309
00:16:58.680 --> 00:16:59.760
<v Regina>The most important message.</v>

310
00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.620
<v ->We are one.</v>

311
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.620
No question about it.

312
00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:07.220
We have cultural cloaks that we celebrate and enjoy.

313
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:11.480
I respect all other cultures and I enjoy the patterns,

314
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.460
the designs, and the sharing, but I'm very proud

315
00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:19.180
of the cultural cloak that I wear right now.

316
00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:23.640
But on a spiritual level, we are all one, all of us.

317
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.620
So religion, what does that actually mean,

318
00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:32.620
because for me, we are spirits having a physical journey.

319
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.940
And we link in, there's no question about it.

320
00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:40.420
We are immortal.

321
00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:44.280
We are immortal, you know, we don't die.

322
00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.240
<v Regina>And in a sense, on a physical level,</v>

323
00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.020
there was a time back where someone in your situation

324
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:52.300
could have been facing their own mortality, so to speak.

325
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.640
This was many years ago, you had to deal with

326
00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:59.260
your own internal challenge, having developed a brain tumor.

327
00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.180
You say this was 20 years ago.

328
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.340
<v ->I had a brain tumor, that's right,</v>

329
00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.880
but I told you that I brought it on myself.

330
00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.840
<v Regina>Right, and that's interesting.</v>

331
00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.320
<v ->Because I transgressed on a spiritual level.</v>

332
00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.120
<v Regina>Can you talk about that</v>

333
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.360
so we can understand how you...

334
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:16.360
<v ->In my world, there's no such thing as disease or illness.</v>

335
00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:22.100
There is only cleansing, and you have to find out why

336
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.420
you have to have a particular type of cleansing.

337
00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:28.876
So as I said, when I had the brain tumor,

338
00:18:28.876 --> 00:18:30.436
I thought that's a big one Rose.

339
00:18:30.436 --> 00:18:32.976
You've transgressed in a big way.

340
00:18:32.976 --> 00:18:35.717
And you had better get it right.

341
00:18:35.717 --> 00:18:40.216
Otherwise, you're not going to get rid of it.

342
00:18:40.216 --> 00:18:44.916
And now you will go out and have to come back again.

343
00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:49.876
So for me, there were two areas that I looked at.

344
00:18:49.876 --> 00:18:52.036
Committing suicide in my previous life,

345
00:18:52.036 --> 00:18:54.856
which I knew I did not do,

346
00:18:54.856 --> 00:18:57.116
and the second one was arrogance.

347
00:18:57.116 --> 00:19:02.116
It was the arrogance that bought me the brain tumor.

348
00:19:03.096 --> 00:19:06.516
Once I worked that out, the goddess of the surgeons

349
00:19:06.516 --> 00:19:11.516
saying that I had such a small chance, if any,

350
00:19:12.316 --> 00:19:15.816
of getting through it, I just laughed

351
00:19:15.816 --> 00:19:20.816
because in my world, we link in with eight dimensions.

352
00:19:21.576 --> 00:19:25.816
That's why we have the symbol of the octopus.

353
00:19:25.816 --> 00:19:28.556
And so for me, only one quarter of one

354
00:19:28.556 --> 00:19:31.856
of those tentacles was having trouble.

355
00:19:31.856 --> 00:19:36.756
The other seven and three quarters were at full power.

356
00:19:36.756 --> 00:19:40.996
And so I could heal myself, but I had to have

357
00:19:40.996 --> 00:19:45.596
a surgeon to take the tumor out.

358
00:19:45.596 --> 00:19:48.716
I got that guidance.

359
00:19:48.716 --> 00:19:50.556
So I held his hands.

360
00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:54.136
I also held the hands of the Indian doctor

361
00:19:54.136 --> 00:19:55.816
who had to do the anesthetics.

362
00:19:57.946 --> 00:19:59.306
That's fine.

363
00:19:59.916 --> 00:20:02.116
<v Regina>And in the Maori tradition,</v>

364
00:20:02.116 --> 00:20:04.196
we're at an energy healing conference.

365
00:20:04.196 --> 00:20:07.536
In the Maori tradition, how would you go about

366
00:20:07.536 --> 00:20:10.836
healing a member of your family or extended family?

367
00:20:10.836 --> 00:20:12.476
Do you heal from within?

368
00:20:12.476 --> 00:20:16.836
Is it self generated or do you assist each other in healing?

369
00:20:16.836 --> 00:20:20.776
<v ->The people have the ability to heal themselves.</v>

370
00:20:20.776 --> 00:20:23.496
They had to believe that.

371
00:20:23.496 --> 00:20:26.616
If I had listened to the surgeon,

372
00:20:26.616 --> 00:20:30.556
as I said, I wouldn't have lived.

373
00:20:32.306 --> 00:20:35.576
So what we're saying to people is look,

374
00:20:35.576 --> 00:20:40.576
there is a lot more to you than having a medical doctor

375
00:20:41.176 --> 00:20:44.336
tell you that you have a terminal cancer

376
00:20:44.336 --> 00:20:46.776
or terminal disease.

377
00:20:46.776 --> 00:20:49.176
The mind is very powerful.

378
00:20:49.176 --> 00:20:54.176
If you believe that then you will die, no question about it.

379
00:20:54.396 --> 00:20:59.396
But if you believe that you have learnt a lesson,

380
00:20:59.516 --> 00:21:03.216
and you thank that entity, we call them entities,

381
00:21:03.216 --> 00:21:08.176
for coming in, then you can move forward.

382
00:21:08.176 --> 00:21:09.816
<v Regina>It's interesting because as you speak,</v>

383
00:21:09.816 --> 00:21:13.156
you have the effect on people of helping them understand,

384
00:21:13.156 --> 00:21:15.096
on one hand how little we know,

385
00:21:15.096 --> 00:21:18.476
but on another, what a vast amount of knowledge

386
00:21:18.476 --> 00:21:23.476
we each possess, and it's that incongruency in the middle

387
00:21:23.516 --> 00:21:27.476
there that somehow the western world needs to bridge.

388
00:21:27.476 --> 00:21:30.516
<v ->Part of the problem with the western world is props,</v>

389
00:21:30.516 --> 00:21:31.776
so help me.

390
00:21:31.776 --> 00:21:32.416
<v Regina>Is what?</v>

391
00:21:32.416 --> 00:21:33.676
<v ->Props.</v>

392
00:21:33.676 --> 00:21:34.916
You know, you gotta have props.

393
00:21:34.916 --> 00:21:38.036
Look at the fact that you had a computer break down.

394
00:21:38.036 --> 00:21:43.036
So help me all your United Airlines were out of commission.

395
00:21:43.256 --> 00:21:48.256
That's unbelievable that a huge country like this

396
00:21:48.934 --> 00:21:53.114
could move into chaos and turmoil

397
00:21:53.114 --> 00:21:57.194
through the loss of computer energy.

398
00:21:57.194 --> 00:22:01.254
I mean, it's just beyond me

399
00:22:01.254 --> 00:22:04.854
because for me, we're tuned in.

400
00:22:04.854 --> 00:22:09.854
We're tuned into the entire, all universes, all galaxies.

401
00:22:10.874 --> 00:22:15.394
And so at home, we lead a very simple lifestyle.

402
00:22:15.394 --> 00:22:19.174
We do not believe in too many props.

403
00:22:19.174 --> 00:22:22.354
We believe that the greatest instrument is yourself

404
00:22:22.354 --> 00:22:27.314
and that's where you start.

405
00:22:27.314 --> 00:22:30.834
Not having a whole lot of props.

406
00:22:30.834 --> 00:22:33.994
And I have noticed that some people

407
00:22:33.994 --> 00:22:37.594
bless them, they come into our context

408
00:22:37.594 --> 00:22:40.254
where life is very simple.

409
00:22:40.254 --> 00:22:44.954
We do not have all the modern electrical appliances,

410
00:22:44.954 --> 00:22:47.694
and they just had to get on with it.

411
00:22:47.694 --> 00:22:51.294
Sometimes they had to use an open fire.

412
00:22:51.294 --> 00:22:55.074
We had two white American men who came in

413
00:22:55.074 --> 00:22:58.094
to tell us, the Maori, our family,

414
00:22:58.094 --> 00:23:03.094
he wanted us to be able to preserve food for 30 years

415
00:23:04.234 --> 00:23:07.894
and be able to handle famine and all this stuff.

416
00:23:07.894 --> 00:23:11.274
Ah yeah, and they told us they were taught

417
00:23:11.274 --> 00:23:14.694
by our brothers and sisters, the first nations people

418
00:23:14.694 --> 00:23:18.054
from this country oh yeah.

419
00:23:18.054 --> 00:23:22.054
One day, I got 50 visitors while they were with me,

420
00:23:22.054 --> 00:23:23.494
and we had a power cut.

421
00:23:23.494 --> 00:23:25.214
There was no electricity.

422
00:23:25.214 --> 00:23:27.794
So I said to them well you two have told me

423
00:23:27.794 --> 00:23:30.974
how practical, how you can handle things,

424
00:23:30.974 --> 00:23:32.034
get on with it.

425
00:23:32.034 --> 00:23:34.174
You have 50 people to cook for,

426
00:23:34.174 --> 00:23:36.674
and we want lunch at one o'clock.

427
00:23:36.674 --> 00:23:38.214
(laughter)

428
00:23:38.214 --> 00:23:40.834
They were struggling even to get the fire going.

429
00:23:40.834 --> 00:23:44.294
<v Regina>I would like to have seen that one.</v>

430
00:23:44.294 --> 00:23:49.294
<v ->And I said to them, we wouldn't dare insult the universe.</v>

431
00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:52.454
It's a universe of abundance.

432
00:23:52.454 --> 00:23:54.334
We don't turn around and say well universe,

433
00:23:54.334 --> 00:23:56.194
we can't trust you.

434
00:23:56.194 --> 00:23:59.434
We had to preserve food for 30 years.

435
00:23:59.434 --> 00:24:01.474
We're seasonal.

436
00:24:01.474 --> 00:24:03.574
We work in with the seasons, and

437
00:24:03.574 --> 00:24:08.574
we thank, we thank everything for the way it helps us out.

438
00:24:09.814 --> 00:24:11.934
That's what I'm talking about.

439
00:24:11.934 --> 00:24:15.234
The western world is too reliant.

440
00:24:15.234 --> 00:24:20.234
Take away, what would happen here if we had your power cut?

441
00:24:20.494 --> 00:24:22.634
What would happen to the states if we had

442
00:24:22.634 --> 00:24:25.274
power cuts right through this country?

443
00:24:25.274 --> 00:24:27.714
<v Regina>Everything stops.</v>

444
00:24:27.714 --> 00:24:29.994
<v ->And then what?</v>

445
00:24:29.994 --> 00:24:34.994
So in my world, no, we are still hunters.

446
00:24:35.414 --> 00:24:39.614
And we still know how to survive in terms of

447
00:24:39.614 --> 00:24:43.814
the natural world, the natural environment.

448
00:24:43.814 --> 00:24:45.614
<v Regina>A moment ago, you were talking about</v>

449
00:24:45.614 --> 00:24:47.214
your connection with all things.

450
00:24:47.214 --> 00:24:49.714
You were talking with galaxies beyond.

451
00:24:49.714 --> 00:24:53.334
Do your people, do you communicate also

452
00:24:53.334 --> 00:24:55.374
with beings that are from other galaxies?

453
00:24:55.374 --> 00:24:57.014
<v ->We do, we do.</v>

454
00:24:57.014 --> 00:24:57.794
<v Regina>Can you talk a little bit about this?</v>

455
00:24:57.794 --> 00:25:00.474
<v ->We link into Sirius.</v>

456
00:25:00.474 --> 00:25:04.034
We link into the North Star.

457
00:25:04.034 --> 00:25:08.234
Pleiades, I'm trying to remember the English names.

458
00:25:08.234 --> 00:25:12.594
My first language is Maori.

459
00:25:12.594 --> 00:25:16.314
Jupiter, Venus, Mars.

460
00:25:16.314 --> 00:25:17.894
We link into all of those.

461
00:25:17.894 --> 00:25:20.674
<v Regina>What do you hear these days or in this lifetime?</v>

462
00:25:20.674 --> 00:25:23.054
What is the information streaming through

463
00:25:23.054 --> 00:25:24.274
from other places to us?

464
00:25:24.274 --> 00:25:26.434
<v ->We're getting a lot of support from those other planets.</v>

465
00:25:26.434 --> 00:25:29.014
I can assure you of that.

466
00:25:29.014 --> 00:25:33.914
In terms of trying to conserve what's left.

467
00:25:33.914 --> 00:25:38.354
In terms of people remembering the oneness

468
00:25:38.354 --> 00:25:42.414
and being able to link into that consciousness.

469
00:25:42.414 --> 00:25:45.994
We have support, and that's how we work.

470
00:25:45.994 --> 00:25:50.074
There's no limit, no limit whatsoever.

471
00:25:50.074 --> 00:25:51.114
<v Regina>It seems that a lot of people</v>

472
00:25:51.114 --> 00:25:55.074
at this conference, this is a lot of previously known

473
00:25:55.074 --> 00:25:57.474
knowledge that's being remembered

474
00:25:57.474 --> 00:26:00.864
as much as being created or invented.

475
00:26:00.871 --> 00:26:02.631
Are we getting assistance from other places

476
00:26:02.631 --> 00:26:04.911
in helping us remember these technologies that exist?

477
00:26:04.911 --> 00:26:09.171
<v ->Well we had a good session today with Freddy, is it?</v>

478
00:26:09.171 --> 00:26:10.051
<v Regina>Oh fabulous.</v>

479
00:26:10.051 --> 00:26:15.051
<v ->What he was talking about, well it's not new to us.</v>

480
00:26:16.491 --> 00:26:21.491
Even all the patterns, for us, mathematics is

481
00:26:23.251 --> 00:26:28.251
the study of all possible patterns, including empty sets.

482
00:26:30.241 --> 00:26:33.651
We can construct things without, in one place,

483
00:26:33.651 --> 00:26:37.451
and then carry it to another and just set it all up.

484
00:26:37.451 --> 00:26:40.291
Without any instruments.

485
00:26:40.291 --> 00:26:42.851
<v Regina>What are some of your most sacred</v>

486
00:26:42.851 --> 00:26:46.611
geometrical forms that you work with in your culture,

487
00:26:46.611 --> 00:26:50.651
for either healing or for remembering or communication?

488
00:26:50.651 --> 00:26:54.811
<v ->Healing is, we work with the DNA in people.</v>

489
00:26:54.811 --> 00:26:57.431
The DNA, for us, is the blue and red,

490
00:26:57.431 --> 00:26:59.011
and you've got spirals, haven't you?

491
00:26:59.011 --> 00:27:00.291
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

492
00:27:00.291 --> 00:27:03.451
<v ->So we work with that because that is what</v>

493
00:27:03.451 --> 00:27:08.451
we have in common with the whole of humanity

494
00:27:08.591 --> 00:27:13.591
is that our Maori word for a human being is "tanata".

495
00:27:15.091 --> 00:27:19.491
The first part of the word, ta, stands for ta mocho,

496
00:27:19.491 --> 00:27:22.151
which means the DNA.

497
00:27:22.151 --> 00:27:26.791
The second part, na is the bris, from the source.

498
00:27:26.791 --> 00:27:31.791
The last ta stands for taiya, which means I am a hologram.

499
00:27:38.551 --> 00:27:42.611
So those patterns, and if you look at a lot of our patterns,

500
00:27:42.611 --> 00:27:46.252
you can see, you know in my headgear,

501
00:27:46.252 --> 00:27:49.692
you see even New Zealand has a coda pattern,

502
00:27:49.692 --> 00:27:54.692
a shape like that for in front.

503
00:27:54.772 --> 00:27:57.612
So for us, we are more than family.

504
00:27:57.612 --> 00:28:00.672
If you look at meeting houses, communal houses,

505
00:28:00.672 --> 00:28:05.092
you will see a lot of the patterns he was talking about.

506
00:28:05.092 --> 00:28:08.512
You will see it, look at my sweet Addy,

507
00:28:08.512 --> 00:28:09.732
he's sick and tired of all this.

508
00:28:09.732 --> 00:28:11.272
Scuse me darling.

509
00:28:11.272 --> 00:28:12.752
Oh no, you haven't got your belt.

510
00:28:12.752 --> 00:28:17.411
His kind of a belt, it's woven.

511
00:28:17.411 --> 00:28:20.811
It has a lot of the patterns that we saw today.

512
00:28:20.811 --> 00:28:22.351
So for our people,

513
00:28:22.351 --> 00:28:23.611
<v Regina>It's always been there.</v>

514
00:28:23.611 --> 00:28:25.871
<v ->we were being a literate people,</v>

515
00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:28.511
we were told we were illiterate,

516
00:28:28.511 --> 00:28:29.791
and I've had to say to people,

517
00:28:29.791 --> 00:28:33.011
do you know what literate really means?

518
00:28:33.011 --> 00:28:35.931
Can you read nature?

519
00:28:35.931 --> 00:28:39.931
Can you read what we say to you in the house?

520
00:28:39.931 --> 00:28:42.911
No you can't.

521
00:28:42.911 --> 00:28:45.971
We can work yours out just like this,

522
00:28:45.971 --> 00:28:49.331
just knowing the patterns.

523
00:28:51.881 --> 00:28:54.731
For me, I learned about the western world,

524
00:28:54.731 --> 00:28:57.011
it was no problem.

525
00:28:57.011 --> 00:29:01.131
I could do things just through my mind,

526
00:29:01.131 --> 00:29:03.871
and run circles around the teachers

527
00:29:03.871 --> 00:29:07.471
because the teachers were all white, most of them,

528
00:29:07.471 --> 00:29:10.711
left brained, for God's sake.

529
00:29:10.711 --> 00:29:13.731
We're whole brained for learning people.

530
00:29:13.731 --> 00:29:14.971
We work with the whole brain.

531
00:29:14.971 --> 00:29:16.309
We always have.

532
00:29:16.309 --> 00:29:19.949
All our posture dances help us with whole brain learning.

533
00:29:19.949 --> 00:29:24.109
So that we can move into the super consciousness.

534
00:29:24.109 --> 00:29:28.409
So our teachers, if we wanted to please them,

535
00:29:28.409 --> 00:29:31.169
we would move in on the left brain.

536
00:29:31.169 --> 00:29:35.729
If we wanted to really get them raving mad,

537
00:29:35.729 --> 00:29:37.847
we would move in on the right.

538
00:29:37.847 --> 00:29:40.107
They couldn't handle it.

539
00:29:40.107 --> 00:29:42.307
<v Regina>How did that express itself with them?</v>

540
00:29:42.307 --> 00:29:44.507
<v ->Well what does it tell the western world?</v>

541
00:29:44.507 --> 00:29:46.547
Get into gear.

542
00:29:46.547 --> 00:29:49.647
Whole brain learning is a part of us.

543
00:29:49.647 --> 00:29:51.177
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

544
00:29:52.357 --> 00:29:56.087
What is happening with the Maori today?

545
00:29:56.087 --> 00:29:57.767
Who succeeds you?

546
00:29:57.767 --> 00:30:00.807
You're from a long line of people who know and see.

547
00:30:00.807 --> 00:30:03.367
<v ->Oh no, that won't be a problem, you know.</v>

548
00:30:03.367 --> 00:30:04.507
<v Regina>The traditions or...</v>

549
00:30:04.507 --> 00:30:07.627
<v ->No, it won't be a problem, it goes down in a way.</v>

550
00:30:07.627 --> 00:30:09.367
It's in the genes.

551
00:30:09.367 --> 00:30:10.507
<v Regina>So it really doesn't matter if</v>

552
00:30:10.507 --> 00:30:13.107
the outside look changes?

553
00:30:13.107 --> 00:30:14.907
It's still a part of you?

554
00:30:14.907 --> 00:30:16.747
<v ->It's still, I mean no one in it,</v>

555
00:30:16.747 --> 00:30:18.787
most people in our country,

556
00:30:18.787 --> 00:30:20.667
when I was in the department of education,

557
00:30:20.667 --> 00:30:22.787
I had a very senior position.

558
00:30:22.787 --> 00:30:26.227
None of them knew that I was a "tahuna",

559
00:30:26.227 --> 00:30:31.027
wasn't their business, right?

560
00:30:31.027 --> 00:30:35.087
But I knew their world and I knew it inside out.

561
00:30:35.087 --> 00:30:37.567
And I'm one of the few people in New Zealand

562
00:30:37.567 --> 00:30:39.807
who has represented our country

563
00:30:39.807 --> 00:30:44.807
at conferences for teachers of English, internationally.

564
00:30:45.287 --> 00:30:47.967
I've had my white brothers and sisters say,

565
00:30:47.967 --> 00:30:50.027
for God's sake Rose, how come you're going?

566
00:30:50.027 --> 00:30:51.747
And I said obviously my English is

567
00:30:51.747 --> 00:30:54.287
completely superior to yours.

568
00:30:54.287 --> 00:30:55.707
(laughter)

569
00:30:55.707 --> 00:30:57.567
And it is my second language.

570
00:30:57.567 --> 00:31:01.287
<v Regina>Rose, you've been bestowed a lot of honors.</v>

571
00:31:01.287 --> 00:31:02.447
<v ->I have.</v>

572
00:31:02.447 --> 00:31:03.907
I deserve them.

573
00:31:03.907 --> 00:31:07.207
I deserve them for sure because it's been a hard job.

574
00:31:07.207 --> 00:31:10.727
It has been a hard job working with left-brained people.

575
00:31:10.727 --> 00:31:12.147
It really has.

576
00:31:12.147 --> 00:31:13.847
Hard job.

577
00:31:13.847 --> 00:31:18.407
I started in 1956, a group of us Maori people,

578
00:31:18.407 --> 00:31:20.987
working with the system of New Zealand

579
00:31:20.987 --> 00:31:23.147
in terms of education.

580
00:31:23.147 --> 00:31:27.467
We finally got through by the year 1974,

581
00:31:27.467 --> 00:31:30.047
and then Maori became accepted

582
00:31:30.047 --> 00:31:33.467
as part and parcel of New Zealand.

583
00:31:33.467 --> 00:31:35.167
<v Regina>If you can talk to mothers now</v>

584
00:31:35.167 --> 00:31:38.807
in the western world, you've seen how we raise our children.

585
00:31:38.807 --> 00:31:41.267
You've seen what the education system is like.

586
00:31:41.267 --> 00:31:43.187
You have a mother watching right now

587
00:31:43.187 --> 00:31:46.067
with a little child, an infant.

588
00:31:46.067 --> 00:31:50.427
What information can you pass on to them?

589
00:31:50.427 --> 00:31:54.067
<v ->The child is a learner and a teacher.</v>

590
00:31:54.067 --> 00:31:56.287
The child comes in with insight,

591
00:31:56.287 --> 00:31:58.667
everything from the other side.

592
00:31:58.667 --> 00:32:01.685
By the time they're eight in the western world,

593
00:32:01.685 --> 00:32:03.845
that's repressed in them.

594
00:32:03.845 --> 00:32:06.045
You get parents that say to children,

595
00:32:06.045 --> 00:32:08.505
yes I used to be like that darling.

596
00:32:08.505 --> 00:32:11.305
I used to have little friends too.

597
00:32:11.305 --> 00:32:15.605
The child knows about the little friends and can see them.

598
00:32:17.495 --> 00:32:20.965
And so they're ridiculing to a certain extent.

599
00:32:20.965 --> 00:32:23.465
Something that is a natural, vital part.

600
00:32:23.465 --> 00:32:24.845
<v Regina>Patronizing them, yes.</v>

601
00:32:24.845 --> 00:32:29.245
<v ->And in New Zealand, we let our children go</v>

602
00:32:29.245 --> 00:32:32.205
because they learn from firsthand experience.

603
00:32:32.205 --> 00:32:35.545
We also treat them as our equals.

604
00:32:35.545 --> 00:32:38.025
We do not speak down.

605
00:32:38.025 --> 00:32:40.905
The other thing is that we learn from them.

606
00:32:40.905 --> 00:32:44.305
For example, I taught my grandparents' generation

607
00:32:44.305 --> 00:32:45.825
how to rock and roll.

608
00:32:45.825 --> 00:32:47.445
(laughter)

609
00:32:47.445 --> 00:32:51.465
And they taught me the Charleston.

610
00:32:51.465 --> 00:32:56.165
So I mean, in my culture, the generations learn

611
00:32:56.165 --> 00:33:01.165
from each other and we have intergenerational teaching.

612
00:33:01.425 --> 00:33:04.685
At home, our grandchildren live with us,

613
00:33:04.685 --> 00:33:08.925
and our children, and we also have great grandchildren.

614
00:33:08.925 --> 00:33:11.745
So that what we're transmitting,

615
00:33:11.745 --> 00:33:13.525
we are the first teachers.

616
00:33:13.525 --> 00:33:17.225
The grandparents are the first teachers in my culture

617
00:33:17.225 --> 00:33:20.945
because the parents are busy making a living,

618
00:33:20.945 --> 00:33:24.145
building up the economic base.

619
00:33:24.145 --> 00:33:27.645
And we have all the patience in the world

620
00:33:27.645 --> 00:33:29.965
with our grandchildren.

621
00:33:29.965 --> 00:33:31.345
<v Regina>It seems so important because</v>

622
00:33:31.345 --> 00:33:35.385
here, the family has been so fragmented,

623
00:33:35.385 --> 00:33:40.145
and it seems through sheer economic impetus alone,

624
00:33:40.145 --> 00:33:41.625
it's going to be necessary for people

625
00:33:41.625 --> 00:33:43.445
to begin coming back together again,

626
00:33:43.445 --> 00:33:46.365
which I think is fabulous.

627
00:33:46.365 --> 00:33:48.365
Why do we think we should toss our children out

628
00:33:48.365 --> 00:33:52.205
at the age of 18 and we have our own little house,

629
00:33:52.205 --> 00:33:53.885
each person has their own little house,

630
00:33:53.885 --> 00:33:56.425
or individuals, their own little condiminium

631
00:33:56.425 --> 00:33:57.865
separate from each other.

632
00:33:57.865 --> 00:33:59.605
It doesn't make sense that we live like this.

633
00:33:59.605 --> 00:34:01.925
<v ->That is a constant battle for us in New Zealand,</v>

634
00:34:01.925 --> 00:34:03.885
the Maori, because we're used to

635
00:34:03.885 --> 00:34:08.825
family oriented situations and living,

636
00:34:08.825 --> 00:34:13.185
and they are forever trying to separate the genders,

637
00:34:13.185 --> 00:34:17.205
forever trying to separate the generations,

638
00:34:17.205 --> 00:34:22.085
by trying to come across our entire way of thinking.

639
00:34:22.085 --> 00:34:25.065
And I've said to our people, no, we can not afford

640
00:34:25.065 --> 00:34:30.005
to follow in their footsteps because for us,

641
00:34:30.005 --> 00:34:35.005
we have to remember that we link in to the cosmos,

642
00:34:37.482 --> 00:34:41.301
that we link into, that there's no limit to our thinking,

643
00:34:41.301 --> 00:34:43.941
and our children, they are treasures.

644
00:34:43.941 --> 00:34:45.619
They are miracles.

645
00:34:45.619 --> 00:34:49.619
"Hatinotanga", absolute treasures.

646
00:34:49.619 --> 00:34:53.539
And so they have the right to be true to themselves.

647
00:34:53.539 --> 00:34:56.709
They are not possessions.

648
00:34:58.879 --> 00:35:03.879
They are divine beings that have a right

649
00:35:04.605 --> 00:35:06.875
to be true to themselves.

650
00:35:06.875 --> 00:35:09.441
(thunder)

651
00:35:09.441 --> 00:35:10.861
<v Regina>Confirmation.</v>

652
00:35:10.861 --> 00:35:11.721
<v ->You see that?</v>

653
00:35:11.721 --> 00:35:12.821
<v Regina>The first thunder.</v>

654
00:35:12.821 --> 00:35:13.561
<v ->You see that?</v>

655
00:35:13.561 --> 00:35:16.321
<v Regina>Yes, that is perfect.</v>

656
00:35:16.321 --> 00:35:17.201
<v ->You see that.</v>

657
00:35:17.201 --> 00:35:18.881
<v Regina>And every one of us has that right.</v>

658
00:35:18.881 --> 00:35:22.001
<v ->You see that we have that right.</v>

659
00:35:22.001 --> 00:35:24.821
My grandson, he's 27 and one of them,

660
00:35:24.821 --> 00:35:28.181
he's driving me crazy, but it's not my journey,

661
00:35:28.181 --> 00:35:29.721
it is his.

662
00:35:29.721 --> 00:35:31.981
And I have to respect that.

663
00:35:31.981 --> 00:35:34.621
You see, I'm one of those people that has spoken out

664
00:35:34.621 --> 00:35:39.621
against genetic engineering, against in vitro fertilization,

665
00:35:39.641 --> 00:35:43.481
and I remember someone saying that you know,

666
00:35:43.481 --> 00:35:45.921
the sexual act can be so clumsy,

667
00:35:45.921 --> 00:35:48.441
and I said oh is that right?

668
00:35:48.441 --> 00:35:51.141
So you would prefer to have a woman

669
00:35:51.141 --> 00:35:54.721
drinking wine in one room at the hospital

670
00:35:54.721 --> 00:35:59.181
surrounded by parts that look like penises?

671
00:35:59.181 --> 00:36:01.781
And then you have a man in another room

672
00:36:01.781 --> 00:36:06.781
reading a Penthouse magazine and you dare say to me

673
00:36:07.621 --> 00:36:12.401
that a natural relationship is clumsy?

674
00:36:12.401 --> 00:36:15.701
(laughter)

675
00:36:15.701 --> 00:36:20.241
And do you have Maori donor fathers?

676
00:36:20.241 --> 00:36:24.061
Oh no, they didn't in New Zealand.

677
00:36:24.061 --> 00:36:26.201
I said do you have Jewish donor fathers?

678
00:36:26.201 --> 00:36:27.621
Nope.

679
00:36:27.621 --> 00:36:29.961
I said that's very interesting.

680
00:36:29.961 --> 00:36:33.481
So all of the donor fathers are Caucasian, are they?

681
00:36:33.481 --> 00:36:38.421
Said, oh yes, well we have the IQ and all this and all that,

682
00:36:38.421 --> 00:36:40.261
and I said oh is that right.

683
00:36:40.261 --> 00:36:42.521
So if two people meet in the future,

684
00:36:42.521 --> 00:36:47.341
they say I hope your donor father's not number 17

685
00:36:47.341 --> 00:36:49.161
because that's mine, you know?

686
00:36:49.161 --> 00:36:51.201
(laughter)

687
00:36:51.201 --> 00:36:56.201
For me, a Maori, that believes in the sacredness

688
00:36:58.201 --> 00:37:02.601
of the union of the mother and father energies,

689
00:37:02.601 --> 00:37:05.401
and we are linked into that.

690
00:37:05.401 --> 00:37:09.801
Joe and I, he is my right, I am his left.

691
00:37:09.801 --> 00:37:13.341
That's just beyond...

692
00:37:13.341 --> 00:37:17.721
And for me, in the Maori culture,

693
00:37:17.721 --> 00:37:19.881
genealogy is important, not saying

694
00:37:19.881 --> 00:37:22.741
number 17 is my donor father.

695
00:37:22.741 --> 00:37:27.741
It is meant to say my mother is so-and-so,

696
00:37:30.161 --> 00:37:32.561
that my father is so-and-so, then being able

697
00:37:32.561 --> 00:37:35.583
to go back in with the generations.

698
00:37:35.583 --> 00:37:38.763
Very important, our genealogy is important.

699
00:37:38.763 --> 00:37:40.983
That's why I can sit here.

700
00:37:40.983 --> 00:37:45.083
I can stand up with confidence because I know who I am.

701
00:37:45.083 --> 00:37:49.883
I know from whence I came and I know where I'm going.

702
00:37:49.883 --> 00:37:52.183
How many people know that?

703
00:37:52.183 --> 00:37:54.143
<v Regina>Not many.</v>

704
00:37:54.143 --> 00:37:56.163
Not many in the west.

705
00:37:56.163 --> 00:38:00.163
<v ->It is not enough to say go under father number 17,</v>

706
00:38:00.163 --> 00:38:05.163
IQ 160, no.

707
00:38:05.563 --> 00:38:07.643
In fact you had a situation here in the States

708
00:38:07.643 --> 00:38:10.823
where the donor father was ugly ass,

709
00:38:10.823 --> 00:38:13.543
and a lot of the children ended up looking like that.

710
00:38:13.543 --> 00:38:16.203
Well, right.

711
00:38:16.203 --> 00:38:17.983
<v Regina>Well again, it's trying to put value</v>

712
00:38:17.983 --> 00:38:20.983
on all the externals instead of the whole.

713
00:38:20.983 --> 00:38:23.063
<v ->And what I've found out, a lot of people,</v>

714
00:38:23.063 --> 00:38:24.943
the reason why they have that old,

715
00:38:24.943 --> 00:38:26.303
they have to have a child is because

716
00:38:26.303 --> 00:38:29.363
they see them as a possession.

717
00:38:29.363 --> 00:38:30.163
Possession.

718
00:38:30.163 --> 00:38:31.083
<v Regina>Just like a nice car.</v>

719
00:38:31.083 --> 00:38:34.063
Something else to round out the picture of life.

720
00:38:34.063 --> 00:38:36.943
<v ->You see, we had lesbians who attended the conference</v>

721
00:38:36.943 --> 00:38:41.204
where I spoke out against in vitro fertilization.

722
00:38:41.204 --> 00:38:45.343
And they said to me, these were Maori lesbians, okay?

723
00:38:45.343 --> 00:38:48.103
They said well we really want children.

724
00:38:48.103 --> 00:38:51.463
I said get on to your tribal brothers.

725
00:38:51.463 --> 00:38:56.043
At least you will know their genealogy.

726
00:38:56.043 --> 00:38:57.763
And it's happened.

727
00:38:57.763 --> 00:38:59.243
I said don't go there.

728
00:38:59.243 --> 00:39:01.943
Don't even consider it.

729
00:39:01.943 --> 00:39:04.843
It is alien.

730
00:39:04.843 --> 00:39:09.843
For example, Jesus, I saw him smash these tubes.

731
00:39:09.843 --> 00:39:12.103
I said to him, the only time I ever read

732
00:39:12.103 --> 00:39:16.543
about you losing your temper was in the temple.

733
00:39:16.543 --> 00:39:21.543
It was his anger against in vitro fertilization.

734
00:39:23.103 --> 00:39:26.203
Now people might say good God, who is this woman?

735
00:39:26.203 --> 00:39:28.703
Too bad people.

736
00:39:28.703 --> 00:39:31.623
I've seen Jesus and I know him.

737
00:39:31.623 --> 00:39:34.523
The other thing is, he loves me for myself.

738
00:39:34.523 --> 00:39:37.983
He has never told me to be any different.

739
00:39:37.983 --> 00:39:39.203
Never.

740
00:39:39.203 --> 00:39:44.144
All I know from him is love, unconditional love.

741
00:39:44.144 --> 00:39:48.423
Not telling me to change or to be any different.

742
00:39:48.423 --> 00:39:51.703
And so for me, when I have so-called Christians

743
00:39:51.703 --> 00:39:53.123
who talk to me, I say to them,

744
00:39:53.123 --> 00:39:55.863
do you really know what you're talking about?

745
00:39:55.863 --> 00:39:59.944
Are you really practicing unconditional love?

746
00:39:59.944 --> 00:40:04.944
Are you really promoting what Jesus was all about?

747
00:40:06.103 --> 00:40:08.443
A challenge.

748
00:40:08.443 --> 00:40:10.183
<v Regina>It is a challenge, and on the subject</v>

749
00:40:10.183 --> 00:40:13.483
of this about the judgement that we have of each other,

750
00:40:13.483 --> 00:40:15.883
and putting on ourselves as well,

751
00:40:15.883 --> 00:40:18.003
as I asked a moment ago for you to please speak

752
00:40:18.003 --> 00:40:20.643
to a mother regarding a child,

753
00:40:20.643 --> 00:40:22.683
what about the mother herself?

754
00:40:22.683 --> 00:40:25.883
In the western world, in America in particular,

755
00:40:25.883 --> 00:40:29.023
the women are so full of self-loathing

756
00:40:29.023 --> 00:40:32.543
because maybe they age,

757
00:40:32.543 --> 00:40:35.583
maybe they gain 10 or 20 or 30 pounds.

758
00:40:35.583 --> 00:40:37.503
<v ->Oh look, we love ourselves, you see.</v>

759
00:40:37.503 --> 00:40:38.963
That's how we are.

760
00:40:38.963 --> 00:40:40.463
We just love ourselves.

761
00:40:40.463 --> 00:40:42.443
I said Joe's a lucky man because

762
00:40:42.443 --> 00:40:44.263
he's got interests over the years with

763
00:40:44.263 --> 00:40:45.743
me putting on weight, you know.

764
00:40:45.743 --> 00:40:46.443
(laughter)

765
00:40:46.443 --> 00:40:47.583
<v Regina>Interest in the bank.</v>

766
00:40:47.583 --> 00:40:48.583
<v ->Of course.</v>

767
00:40:48.583 --> 00:40:51.223
Now for us, we're perfect.

768
00:40:51.223 --> 00:40:53.003
We don't want to be like anyone else.

769
00:40:53.003 --> 00:40:57.043
And it's tragic when people think like that.

770
00:40:57.043 --> 00:41:01.843
And say, oh, I mean that's alien to me

771
00:41:01.843 --> 00:41:05.123
that people want to change themselves

772
00:41:05.123 --> 00:41:06.303
to look like someone else.

773
00:41:06.303 --> 00:41:09.243
I don't understand this sort of thinking.

774
00:41:09.243 --> 00:41:13.423
For example, I had a pakeha woman

775
00:41:13.423 --> 00:41:16.763
in New Zealand say to me in education,

776
00:41:16.763 --> 00:41:19.923
Rose, you must never light your own cigarette.

777
00:41:19.923 --> 00:41:24.343
You will lose 75% of your sex appeal,

778
00:41:24.343 --> 00:41:26.783
and men, you know, all this.

779
00:41:26.783 --> 00:41:29.183
I said who told you that rubbish?

780
00:41:29.183 --> 00:41:32.663
You either have sex appeal or you don't.

781
00:41:32.663 --> 00:41:34.103
I can assure you.

782
00:41:34.103 --> 00:41:37.883
And one of the biggest occupational hazards I have

783
00:41:37.883 --> 00:41:41.223
is keeping pakeha men the hell out of my space.

784
00:41:41.223 --> 00:41:42.623
(laughter)

785
00:41:42.623 --> 00:41:44.423
Why do they take to me?

786
00:41:44.423 --> 00:41:47.743
Because I am true to myself.

787
00:41:47.743 --> 00:41:49.803
And I've said this to pakeha women.

788
00:41:49.803 --> 00:41:53.463
They fell in love with a woman who was true to herself.

789
00:41:53.463 --> 00:41:55.523
What's happened to you?

790
00:41:55.523 --> 00:42:00.083
You have followed the dictates of your society.

791
00:42:00.083 --> 00:42:03.843
Where you're supposed to be behind your husband,

792
00:42:03.843 --> 00:42:06.823
you're regarded as a subordinate.

793
00:42:06.823 --> 00:42:09.783
When the missionaries came, they couldn't stand

794
00:42:09.783 --> 00:42:13.543
the fact that we had women who were in

795
00:42:13.543 --> 00:42:16.863
positions of sovereign power.

796
00:42:16.863 --> 00:42:19.163
They couldn't.

797
00:42:19.163 --> 00:42:23.003
And they couldn't handle women in terms of

798
00:42:23.003 --> 00:42:25.843
having some say in control.

799
00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:28.023
<v Regina>Yes, which brings me to</v>

800
00:42:28.023 --> 00:42:30.683
one of my last questions just because

801
00:42:30.683 --> 00:42:33.403
I think we may be close to running out of tape here,

802
00:42:33.403 --> 00:42:36.683
and that is, you've spoken to the child.

803
00:42:36.683 --> 00:42:38.483
You've spoken to the woman.

804
00:42:38.483 --> 00:42:40.283
What do you have to say to the men

805
00:42:40.283 --> 00:42:43.243
because in the west, the men are as confused as the women

806
00:42:43.243 --> 00:42:46.023
trying to be something they're not.

807
00:42:46.023 --> 00:42:47.233
<v ->The men...</v>

808
00:42:49.523 --> 00:42:50.603
all of us are perfect.

809
00:42:50.603 --> 00:42:52.743
We are beautiful beings.

810
00:42:52.743 --> 00:42:55.823
For me, and if you have two people

811
00:42:55.823 --> 00:42:57.583
from the same gender going together,

812
00:42:57.583 --> 00:43:00.583
we don't, we have nothing to say about that.

813
00:43:00.583 --> 00:43:03.583
As far as we're concerned, they're still part of our family.

814
00:43:03.583 --> 00:43:06.423
And it's the same with men and women.

815
00:43:06.423 --> 00:43:08.983
As far as we're concerned, we are one unit.

816
00:43:08.983 --> 00:43:10.683
We go together.

817
00:43:10.683 --> 00:43:13.983
We're having trouble in New Zealand

818
00:43:13.983 --> 00:43:17.263
because I've had men wanting me to facilitate

819
00:43:17.263 --> 00:43:22.263
conferences for them because they feel they've got sin

820
00:43:22.343 --> 00:43:26.943
about the number of men that are in prisons,

821
00:43:26.943 --> 00:43:30.043
the number of men that are in psych units,

822
00:43:30.043 --> 00:43:32.663
and so we have to work on these things.

823
00:43:32.663 --> 00:43:37.663
They are concerned about the violence in homes.

824
00:43:37.943 --> 00:43:41.563
And so what we're doing is we're working on the liver

825
00:43:41.563 --> 00:43:46.203
of men, going right back as long as humanity has existed

826
00:43:46.203 --> 00:43:49.703
to heal the liver of men.

827
00:43:49.703 --> 00:43:52.043
It doesn't matter what culture we're talking about.

828
00:43:52.043 --> 00:43:55.403
In a woman, it's to heal the spleen

829
00:43:55.403 --> 00:44:00.403
and also the sacred seed of power, which is the womb.

830
00:44:01.123 --> 00:44:06.123
Now for Maori women, no, we are seen as

831
00:44:06.383 --> 00:44:07.943
a very powerful energy.

832
00:44:07.943 --> 00:44:10.103
The mother energy is very very important.

833
00:44:10.103 --> 00:44:11.999
So is the father energy.

834
00:44:11.999 --> 00:44:14.379
We don't compete with each other.

835
00:44:14.379 --> 00:44:16.679
We complement each other,

836
00:44:16.679 --> 00:44:19.059
and a lot of our native birds,

837
00:44:19.059 --> 00:44:22.019
they stay with one partner for life.

838
00:44:22.019 --> 00:44:25.695
And if one partner dies, the other one dies

839
00:44:25.695 --> 00:44:27.995
because they work together,

840
00:44:27.995 --> 00:44:30.295
and so for Joe and I, in terms of our marriage,

841
00:44:30.295 --> 00:44:35.295
47 years, we liken ourselves to the birds.

842
00:44:37.135 --> 00:44:39.975
They stay with the one partner

843
00:44:39.975 --> 00:44:41.975
on the whole.

844
00:44:41.975 --> 00:44:45.895
But it doesn't mean that we condemn other people

845
00:44:45.895 --> 00:44:48.615
who may have had different partners.

846
00:44:48.615 --> 00:44:52.115
That doesn't, in fact, a lot of people,

847
00:44:52.115 --> 00:44:55.575
our solo mothers and fathers come to visit us

848
00:44:55.575 --> 00:45:00.495
because they want their children to identify with the role,

849
00:45:00.495 --> 00:45:04.895
the model that we are.

850
00:45:04.895 --> 00:45:07.515
Well you've seen, some of you would have seen the fact

851
00:45:07.515 --> 00:45:10.055
that there is no way that I could have done

852
00:45:10.055 --> 00:45:14.455
my sharing yesterday without Joe.

853
00:45:14.455 --> 00:45:16.375
He had to come on the stage.

854
00:45:16.375 --> 00:45:18.135
That is how we are.

855
00:45:18.135 --> 00:45:20.015
He's my esteemed partner.

856
00:45:20.015 --> 00:45:21.755
I am his.

857
00:45:21.755 --> 00:45:25.115
And so there for us, that's what we're trying to say

858
00:45:25.115 --> 00:45:26.755
to our young people because they're getting

859
00:45:26.755 --> 00:45:29.055
caught up in western thinking.

860
00:45:29.055 --> 00:45:32.875
We're saying to them think very very carefully

861
00:45:32.875 --> 00:45:37.875
because men, I said, you are sacred.

862
00:45:38.055 --> 00:45:40.855
For example, you take vagina.

863
00:45:40.855 --> 00:45:43.975
Vagina means a sheath for a sword,

864
00:45:43.975 --> 00:45:47.635
so I said to Joe, in the western world,

865
00:45:47.635 --> 00:45:49.575
they talk about a vagina.

866
00:45:49.575 --> 00:45:52.055
I have a sheath for your sword Joe.

867
00:45:52.055 --> 00:45:57.055
Now, in my world, we refer to that as tara.

868
00:45:57.125 --> 00:46:02.125
Ta is the DNA, ra from the single sun, the divine spot.

869
00:46:02.346 --> 00:46:06.126
So that the vagina is symbolic of

870
00:46:06.126 --> 00:46:09.766
the single sun, the divine spot.

871
00:46:09.766 --> 00:46:14.466
That's how divine the mother is.

872
00:46:14.466 --> 00:46:16.426
Huge difference, huh?

873
00:46:16.426 --> 00:46:17.387
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

874
00:46:17.387 --> 00:46:21.566
<v ->The men, for their testicles, raho.</v>

875
00:46:21.566 --> 00:46:24.926
Ho is the the vibration of the divine father,

876
00:46:24.926 --> 00:46:28.286
from the single sun, the divine spot.

877
00:46:28.286 --> 00:46:30.486
Sacred, sacred.

878
00:46:30.486 --> 00:46:32.126
Our heads are sacred.

879
00:46:32.126 --> 00:46:34.586
The genital region is sacred

880
00:46:34.586 --> 00:46:36.966
for both men and women.

881
00:46:36.966 --> 00:46:38.986
Both men and women.

882
00:46:38.986 --> 00:46:40.486
<v Regina>What does it do to us as a people</v>

883
00:46:40.486 --> 00:46:42.946
when that may be exploited?

884
00:46:42.946 --> 00:46:45.186
<v ->Well we all know that.</v>

885
00:46:45.186 --> 00:46:47.466
We know what happens.

886
00:46:47.466 --> 00:46:52.466
Now for us, your whole body is sacred,

887
00:46:53.326 --> 00:46:57.086
particularly your head and your genital region.

888
00:46:57.086 --> 00:47:00.806
It's not the central station, it's a temple.

889
00:47:00.806 --> 00:47:03.766
(laughter)

890
00:47:03.766 --> 00:47:07.406
Sacred, absolutely sacred.

891
00:47:07.406 --> 00:47:09.046
So that's what I have to say to the men.

892
00:47:09.046 --> 00:47:11.346
No, you are sacred.

893
00:47:11.346 --> 00:47:14.986
The penis, our word for that is uria.

894
00:47:14.986 --> 00:47:17.567
It means the vibration of earth mother

895
00:47:17.567 --> 00:47:20.146
and the vibration of the heavens.

896
00:47:20.146 --> 00:47:22.566
That's what that links into.

897
00:47:22.566 --> 00:47:24.626
What else can I say?

898
00:47:24.626 --> 00:47:27.206
That's how we see our men.

899
00:47:27.206 --> 00:47:30.386
And our men see us in the same way.

900
00:47:30.386 --> 00:47:31.706
<v Regina>So much more at home.</v>

901
00:47:31.706 --> 00:47:36.706
<v ->We link into the divine spot.</v>

902
00:47:37.106 --> 00:47:39.346
<v Regina>Any final messages for everybody?</v>

903
00:47:39.346 --> 00:47:43.049
Not men, not women, not children, all of us.

904
00:47:43.049 --> 00:47:45.089
<v ->All of us, we are one.</v>

905
00:47:45.089 --> 00:47:46.789
We are a beautiful family of people

906
00:47:46.789 --> 00:47:48.649
right across the world.

907
00:47:48.649 --> 00:47:51.749
All we have to do is to remember that.

908
00:47:51.749 --> 00:47:55.869
And to celebrate all our different cultures

909
00:47:55.869 --> 00:47:58.469
with our beautiful cloaks.

910
00:47:58.469 --> 00:48:01.309
But on a spiritual level, we are one family.

911
00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:04.129
We are all esteemed people.

912
00:48:04.129 --> 00:48:08.189
Not one of us has more divine right than another,

913
00:48:08.189 --> 00:48:11.029
and we all come from the central sun,

914
00:48:11.029 --> 00:48:12.329
the divine spot.

915
00:48:12.329 --> 00:48:14.189
(Maori words)

916
00:48:14.189 --> 00:48:15.889
Much love.

917
00:48:18.129 --> 00:48:20.109
<v Regina>Would you be okay with singing</v>

918
00:48:20.109 --> 00:48:22.569
your little song that you guided us through?

919
00:48:22.569 --> 00:48:25.309
It's so sweet about, the little one at the end

920
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:27.729
of the last talk about our perfection,

921
00:48:27.729 --> 00:48:28.989
about our being perfect.

922
00:48:28.989 --> 00:48:32.129
Just a little song to finish.

923
00:48:32.129 --> 00:48:33.489
<v ->The other thing is that we believe in</v>

924
00:48:33.489 --> 00:48:36.489
loving ourselves to the nth degree,

925
00:48:36.489 --> 00:48:38.729
and so we see ourselves as perfect,

926
00:48:38.729 --> 00:48:41.509
and one of the songs we always sing,

927
00:48:41.509 --> 00:48:43.089
so that other people can understand

928
00:48:43.089 --> 00:48:46.189
what we're trying to say is this one.

929
00:48:46.189 --> 00:48:50.629
♫ Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble

930
00:48:50.629 --> 00:48:54.929
♫ When you're perfect in every way

931
00:48:54.929 --> 00:48:58.489
♫ I can't wait to look in the mirror

932
00:48:58.489 --> 00:49:02.249
♫ I get better looking each day

933
00:49:02.249 --> 00:49:06.769
♫ To know me is to love me

934
00:49:06.769 --> 00:49:10.829
♫ I must be one beautiful being

935
00:49:10.829 --> 00:49:15.427
♫ Oh Lord it's hard to be humble

936
00:49:15.427 --> 00:49:18.707
♫ I'm doing the best that I can

937
00:49:18.707 --> 00:49:21.307
(laughter)

938
00:49:21.307 --> 00:49:25.107
<v Regina>Oh, on that note, I can't thank you enough,</v>

939
00:49:25.107 --> 00:49:27.207
and to know you is to love you.

940
00:49:27.207 --> 00:49:29.497
Thank you.

941
00:49:30.907 --> 00:49:32.707
I must say that I was somewhat intimidated

942
00:49:32.707 --> 00:49:34.587
to sit with Rose as she has a way of looking

943
00:49:34.587 --> 00:49:36.447
right through you, but in the end,

944
00:49:36.447 --> 00:49:38.567
I felt as though I were basking in her warmth

945
00:49:38.567 --> 00:49:40.587
and strength, and shared a beautiful moment

946
00:49:40.587 --> 00:49:42.167
with she and her husband Joe

947
00:49:42.167 --> 00:49:44.347
when they greeted me in the traditional Maori way

948
00:49:44.347 --> 00:49:47.067
by pressing foreheads together in connection.

949
00:49:47.067 --> 00:49:49.267
They then dubbed me an official Kiwi.

950
00:49:49.267 --> 00:49:51.307
I treasure that brief time together.

951
00:49:51.307 --> 00:49:53.697
Until next time, thanks for watching.
