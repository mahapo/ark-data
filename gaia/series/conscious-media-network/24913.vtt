00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.391
<v ->The work of Robert Tennyson Stevens</v>

2
00:00:02.391 --> 00:00:05.331
brings new dimension to term "wordsmith."

3
00:00:05.331 --> 00:00:07.491
With the friendly nudging of a college professor,

4
00:00:07.491 --> 00:00:09.991
Robert delved into the language of the Hopi.

5
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:12.571
This simple decision changed his life.

6
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:15.191
He learned that the Hopi have no word for "now."

7
00:00:15.191 --> 00:00:15.931
Why?

8
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:17.131
Because they always live in

9
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:19.671
and express themselves from the present,

10
00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:22.671
which brings about the power of full manifestation.

11
00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:25.215
Robert says this is what is needed now.

12
00:00:25.215 --> 00:00:27.387
(soothing music)

13
00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:36.781
<v Woman>Back in 1968,</v>

14
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:39.461
you were a business and marketing student.

15
00:00:39.461 --> 00:00:39.983
<v ->Yes.</v>

16
00:00:39.983 --> 00:00:42.503
<v Woman>And then things took an abrupt turn.</v>

17
00:00:42.503 --> 00:00:44.043
Can you tell us what happened?

18
00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.343
<v ->Yes, I can.</v>

19
00:00:45.343 --> 00:00:47.883
A beautiful professor, Bryce Zender,

20
00:00:47.883 --> 00:00:50.123
noticed that I looked different than the rest of the folks

21
00:00:50.123 --> 00:00:52.339
in the marketing and business department.

22
00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:53.539
I had long hair at the time.

23
00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.919
1968, Vietnam was happening.

24
00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:57.739
And he asked, "Hey, would you like to do

25
00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.049
"an independent study? I give everybody A's.

26
00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:01.591
"And I'm happy to give you an A."

27
00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:03.531
And I said, "Well, yes. I'll do it."

28
00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:06.351
And I picked the Hopi Indians 'cause I read a lot

29
00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:08.091
about the Hopi Indians and loved--

30
00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:09.651
It was a new belief system for me,

31
00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:12.671
a new way to live peace instead of war.

32
00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:14.671
And so, I went to him and said,

33
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:16.231
"I'm ready to do a study.

34
00:01:16.231 --> 00:01:18.635
"I'd like to study, or do a syllabus and a study,

35
00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:19.775
"on the Hopi."

36
00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:21.515
And he said, "Cool."

37
00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:22.997
"Study their language."

38
00:01:22.997 --> 00:01:24.197
Now that didn't sound fun to me.

39
00:01:24.197 --> 00:01:25.177
I knew their prophecies.

40
00:01:25.177 --> 00:01:26.957
I mean, I'd studied all about it.

41
00:01:26.957 --> 00:01:29.777
And he said, "No, I'd like you to study their language."

42
00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:32.237
So I studied the work of Benjamin Lee Whorf,

43
00:01:32.237 --> 00:01:35.129
who wrote a book called "Language, Thought and Reality."

44
00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:36.669
He studied four primary cultures,

45
00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:38.141
one of which was Hopi.

46
00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:41.201
And my world literally transformed.

47
00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:43.581
I was in a metamorphosis for months

48
00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:45.461
and months and months.

49
00:01:45.461 --> 00:01:48.441
Because of some basic languaging tenets.

50
00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.321
What Whorf's work was about is

51
00:01:50.321 --> 00:01:53.901
language shapes thought, which shapes reality.

52
00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:57.551
And for me, I just read "Be Here Now" by Ram Das

53
00:01:57.551 --> 00:01:59.945
so being here now was the deal.

54
00:01:59.945 --> 00:02:03.005
And then I found a culture, a language,

55
00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:05.045
which had a reality, a consciousness,

56
00:02:05.045 --> 00:02:08.245
where now is so existent,

57
00:02:08.245 --> 00:02:09.425
they didn't have to use the word "now"

58
00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:10.865
to get back to now.

59
00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:12.805
They're so present here, they couldn't get--

60
00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:15.605
In other words, the rock wasn't over there for them.

61
00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:17.459
<v Woman>You didn't need the word "now" because you</v>

62
00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.599
were already in the now.
<v ->Right.</v>

63
00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.175
<v ->And the rock wasn't separate from them, you know?</v>

64
00:02:20.175 --> 00:02:22.985
The earth is one with them so...

65
00:02:22.985 --> 00:02:24.636
Long story short, it changed--

66
00:02:24.636 --> 00:02:26.416
I began to wake up to

67
00:02:26.416 --> 00:02:29.136
Wait a minute, my own thoughts, my own beliefs,

68
00:02:29.136 --> 00:02:31.776
the words I'm using and hearing and listening to

69
00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:34.056
in my spiritual life, in my practical life,

70
00:02:34.056 --> 00:02:37.146
in my natural healing life, etc.

71
00:02:37.146 --> 00:02:38.767
There's a code going on here,

72
00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:39.527
for me.

73
00:02:39.527 --> 00:02:41.548
There is a glitch.

74
00:02:41.548 --> 00:02:42.528
Because if I'm--

75
00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:46.007
If my language is all about separation and--

76
00:02:46.007 --> 00:02:47.547
or others, in time and future past,

77
00:02:47.547 --> 00:02:49.887
which is where all stress is,

78
00:02:49.887 --> 00:02:53.138
and if now is the only time where my "I am" is,

79
00:02:53.138 --> 00:02:55.697
where God is, where my healed state is--

80
00:02:55.697 --> 00:02:57.438
well, it started a lot for me.

81
00:02:57.438 --> 00:02:59.418
It was a big, big, big upgrade for me.

82
00:02:59.418 --> 00:03:01.058
<v Woman>Well, and you were ahead of the curve</v>

83
00:03:01.058 --> 00:03:02.898
because these are subjects that are coming

84
00:03:02.898 --> 00:03:04.038
into prominence now.

85
00:03:04.038 --> 00:03:06.078
But you have a good 30-year jump start.

86
00:03:06.078 --> 00:03:06.978
<v ->(chuckles) Yes.</v>

87
00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:09.138
<v Woman>35-year jump start on it.</v>

88
00:03:09.138 --> 00:03:13.220
So how did this lead then to the work you're doing now?

89
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.572
<v ->I'm passionate about natural health</v>

90
00:03:16.572 --> 00:03:17.472
so that was part--

91
00:03:17.472 --> 00:03:18.832
one of the spokes of the wheel.

92
00:03:18.832 --> 00:03:21.112
I'm passionate about herbology, homeopathy,

93
00:03:21.112 --> 00:03:23.032
hydrotherapy, acupressure,

94
00:03:23.032 --> 00:03:25.372
a system of healing developed by Dr. John Ray called

95
00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:27.032
Body Electronics.

96
00:03:27.032 --> 00:03:28.492
I began to work with people

97
00:03:28.492 --> 00:03:31.272
and began to hear their languaging of--

98
00:03:31.272 --> 00:03:32.514
in other words, I would say, "Why are you here?"

99
00:03:32.514 --> 00:03:34.014
And every single person knew exactly

100
00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:35.374
what was wrong with them.

101
00:03:35.374 --> 00:03:36.974
Their words were defining

102
00:03:36.974 --> 00:03:39.334
and agreeing with their limitation.

103
00:03:39.334 --> 00:03:41.494
They didn't know what their heal state was.

104
00:03:41.494 --> 00:03:43.174
When I say, "What is your goal?"

105
00:03:43.174 --> 00:03:45.154
"To not feel this."

106
00:03:45.154 --> 00:03:46.214
"To get rid of that."

107
00:03:46.214 --> 00:03:48.174
In other words, none of those answers

108
00:03:48.174 --> 00:03:49.395
were their heal state.

109
00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:50.354
To feel happy.

110
00:03:50.354 --> 00:03:51.634
To feel healthy.

111
00:03:51.634 --> 00:03:53.654
To feel, you know, relaxed, calm.

112
00:03:53.654 --> 00:03:55.094
To have my body work well.

113
00:03:55.094 --> 00:03:57.114
My intestines work well, whatever.

114
00:03:57.114 --> 00:03:59.238
They were always stating what isn't, what couldn't.

115
00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:00.058
And I began to,

116
00:04:00.058 --> 00:04:03.248
Ah, wait a minute, you know, you're--

117
00:04:03.248 --> 00:04:06.529
I realize now, in consciousness, they were using

118
00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:08.349
what I call the Babel Virus,

119
00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.149
which got them sick,

120
00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:13.869
to attempt to get not sick.

121
00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:16.789
And we are beings of "what is" instead of "what isn't."

122
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.409
So you know, at some point, I woke up

123
00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:20.669
to a languaging--

124
00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.289
the bottom line is, instead of going,

125
00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.109
attempting to heal them from outside in,

126
00:04:25.109 --> 00:04:26.509
we get to change our tongue.

127
00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:29.389
The bottom line is consciousness.

128
00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:30.750
<v Woman>And we're a culture,</v>

129
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.001
and in fact, we're a planet that speaks,

130
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:35.821
oftentimes, in the negative,

131
00:04:35.821 --> 00:04:39.111
in terms of what is not happening or what--

132
00:04:39.111 --> 00:04:40.803
By virtue of saying, "We would like to have"

133
00:04:40.803 --> 00:04:42.323
means "We do not have", right?

134
00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:43.083
<v ->Yes. Yes.</v>

135
00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:45.705
<v Woman>And so this is a virus.</v>

136
00:04:45.705 --> 00:04:47.025
<v ->That's exactly what I call it.</v>

137
00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:47.846
It's a Babel Virus.

138
00:04:47.846 --> 00:04:50.266
When left untreated, it will result in disease or death.

139
00:04:50.266 --> 00:04:51.686
Disease, death.

140
00:04:51.686 --> 00:04:53.206
I mean, if somebody says, "I want love.

141
00:04:53.206 --> 00:04:55.417
"I want love. I want love."

142
00:04:55.417 --> 00:04:57.637
Want means to desire without having.

143
00:04:57.637 --> 00:04:59.377
It means to lack.

144
00:04:59.377 --> 00:05:00.117
So even if we--

145
00:05:00.117 --> 00:05:01.937
like somebody says, "I wanna get married."

146
00:05:01.937 --> 00:05:02.857
And they finally get married.

147
00:05:02.857 --> 00:05:05.417
They're still in want of union.

148
00:05:05.417 --> 00:05:07.017
They're in want of the consciousness

149
00:05:07.017 --> 00:05:09.697
or experience of union or marriage.

150
00:05:09.697 --> 00:05:11.677
So "I am married" is totally different than

151
00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:13.537
"I want to be married" or "I want your love"

152
00:05:13.537 --> 00:05:15.097
or "I want you to want me" or "I need--", you know.

153
00:05:15.097 --> 00:05:17.137
The songs that we've all sung in the past,

154
00:05:17.137 --> 00:05:20.998
which were really just babble, and rebooting.

155
00:05:20.998 --> 00:05:23.078
<v Woman>And born out of separation.</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

156
00:05:23.078 --> 00:05:23.908
<v Woman>Loneliness.</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

157
00:05:23.908 --> 00:05:26.367
<v Woman>Country blues, type of thing.</v>
<v ->Yes. Yes.</v>

158
00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:29.048
<v Woman>We have so many areas we need to hop into</v>

159
00:05:29.048 --> 00:05:31.208
but just a little light one on,

160
00:05:31.208 --> 00:05:33.008
is that why it's called babbling?

161
00:05:33.008 --> 00:05:34.161
<v Woman>To babble?</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

162
00:05:34.161 --> 00:05:34.983
<v ->Well, that's my take.</v>

163
00:05:34.983 --> 00:05:36.543
Babylon. I mean, look at the word--

164
00:05:36.543 --> 00:05:38.043
Babylon and Babel, it has like--

165
00:05:38.043 --> 00:05:38.903
Babylon--

166
00:05:38.903 --> 00:05:40.643
I have fun or fun-netics, so to speak--

167
00:05:40.643 --> 00:05:41.484
<v Woman>(laughs)</v>

168
00:05:41.484 --> 00:05:42.624
<v ->with languaging.</v>

169
00:05:42.624 --> 00:05:45.184
And to babble is to state really what isn't,

170
00:05:45.184 --> 00:05:46.704
and the Babel Virus, the language of

171
00:05:46.704 --> 00:05:49.121
want, need, can't, try, etc.

172
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:50.762
is the language of what isn't.

173
00:05:50.762 --> 00:05:52.262
It's the language of separation.

174
00:05:52.262 --> 00:05:53.962
It's the language of struggle,

175
00:05:53.962 --> 00:05:56.622
which is impossible to "I am that I am."

176
00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:59.102
<v Woman>So let's be really linear for just a moment.</v>

177
00:05:59.102 --> 00:06:00.263
<v ->Sure.</v>

178
00:06:00.263 --> 00:06:01.344
<v Woman>Give us the words,</v>

179
00:06:01.344 --> 00:06:03.004
plain and clearly,

180
00:06:03.004 --> 00:06:04.304
that do not serve us,

181
00:06:04.304 --> 00:06:06.484
that most of us are using all day long.

182
00:06:06.484 --> 00:06:07.724
<v ->I call this the domain--</v>

183
00:06:07.724 --> 00:06:10.124
I have 11 domains of self-sabotage,

184
00:06:10.124 --> 00:06:12.285
where they group together in certain frequencies.

185
00:06:12.285 --> 00:06:14.465
One is the Domain of Limitation and No Choice.

186
00:06:14.465 --> 00:06:17.605
Like "I want", "I can't", "I need."

187
00:06:17.605 --> 00:06:19.345
There's a Domain of Co-dependence.

188
00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:22.265
"I'll feel good if you feel good."

189
00:06:22.265 --> 00:06:24.667
There's a Domain of Outcome Almost,

190
00:06:24.667 --> 00:06:27.087
where my goal is happiness.

191
00:06:27.087 --> 00:06:27.887
Where is happiness?

192
00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:30.089
How? What? With who? In what way?

193
00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:32.669
So "I want", "I should", "I can't", "I need",

194
00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.029
"I try", "I hope that I"--

195
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:36.669
"I hope" isn't bad, it's just--

196
00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:38.319
As an example, "Honey, will you marry me?"

197
00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:39.269
"I hope so."

198
00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:41.469
It's not a good answer.
<v Woman>Right.</v>

199
00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:45.108
<v ->Any language, which seems politically correct</v>

200
00:06:45.108 --> 00:06:48.408
and yet doesn't connect with our outcome,

201
00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:49.848
is what I call the language of Babel,

202
00:06:49.848 --> 00:06:51.628
or the language of separation.

203
00:06:51.628 --> 00:06:53.068
I call it the Domains of Limitation

204
00:06:53.068 --> 00:06:55.328
or Domains of Self-sabotage.

205
00:06:55.328 --> 00:06:58.387
Then there's a wake-up, a reboot possible,

206
00:06:58.387 --> 00:07:00.328
which is being connected

207
00:07:00.328 --> 00:07:02.448
so a lot of people say their goal is

208
00:07:02.448 --> 00:07:04.128
you know, "Bob, what's your goal?"

209
00:07:04.128 --> 00:07:05.248
"Happiness."

210
00:07:05.248 --> 00:07:07.288
Happiness is a topic.

211
00:07:07.288 --> 00:07:10.448
If I say, "My goal is my happiness."

212
00:07:10.448 --> 00:07:13.428
Now I've started to make a new creation.

213
00:07:13.428 --> 00:07:14.968
Happiness is just a word.

214
00:07:14.968 --> 00:07:16.428
So we get to be in the picture.

215
00:07:16.428 --> 00:07:18.208
A lot of people say," My goal is money."

216
00:07:18.208 --> 00:07:19.268
Or "the money."

217
00:07:19.268 --> 00:07:21.688
And upgrade that we have in conscious languaging is

218
00:07:21.688 --> 00:07:22.828
"my money."

219
00:07:22.828 --> 00:07:24.348
I mean, it's so wonderful to have people go from

220
00:07:24.348 --> 00:07:26.078
"the money" to "my money."

221
00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:28.580
"The planet" to "our planet."

222
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.320
I mean, what would--

223
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.840
<v Woman>You can feel it.</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

224
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.935
<v Woman>You can feel it in your body.</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

225
00:07:31.935 --> 00:07:33.785
<v Woman>Even when I'm listening to you,</v>

226
00:07:33.785 --> 00:07:35.668
the differentiation between the two is huge,

227
00:07:35.668 --> 00:07:37.128
<v ->Yes.
<v Woman>in terms of how I experience</v>

228
00:07:37.128 --> 00:07:39.029
your saying those words.
<v ->Yes.</v>

229
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:40.358
And it is huge to the individual.

230
00:07:40.358 --> 00:07:42.009
I mean, sometimes what I say,

231
00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:43.849
especially when I train my trainers,

232
00:07:43.849 --> 00:07:47.149
is I say, "Most likely, you're gonna discover one word

233
00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:50.930
"that you've been using automatically and unconsciously,

234
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.652
"that when you catch the word--"

235
00:07:52.652 --> 00:07:53.752
Frequently, it's the word "that."

236
00:07:53.752 --> 00:07:55.633
It's interesting I just said "that you catch"--

237
00:07:55.633 --> 00:07:57.134
"When you catch the word and upgrade it,

238
00:07:57.134 --> 00:07:58.973
"your entire life will change."

239
00:07:58.973 --> 00:08:01.258
And then I say, "Your job is to find your one word

240
00:08:01.258 --> 00:08:02.958
"in class, while we're all together."

241
00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.918
And people, right away, find their one word.

242
00:08:04.918 --> 00:08:07.198
And when they shift the word consciously,

243
00:08:07.198 --> 00:08:09.878
instead of saying "that life", they say "my life,"

244
00:08:09.878 --> 00:08:13.298
as an example, they start to have

245
00:08:13.298 --> 00:08:15.461
their "my life" experience.

246
00:08:16.782 --> 00:08:19.562
<v Woman>And what percentage, would you say,</v>

247
00:08:19.562 --> 00:08:23.082
of the people you've encountered in your lifetime

248
00:08:23.082 --> 00:08:25.702
are subject to these kinds of thoughts

249
00:08:25.702 --> 00:08:26.722
that aren't serving them?

250
00:08:26.722 --> 00:08:29.552
<v ->100%, including myself.</v>

251
00:08:29.552 --> 00:08:32.613
And what I find, the now portion of this is

252
00:08:32.613 --> 00:08:35.413
as we move upscale as a humanity,

253
00:08:35.413 --> 00:08:38.654
Babel is getting louder and louder and louder.

254
00:08:38.654 --> 00:08:42.254
I mean, the simple conversations of "I want to"

255
00:08:42.254 --> 00:08:43.454
and "I can't" and "I need."

256
00:08:43.454 --> 00:08:45.714
It literally--

257
00:08:45.714 --> 00:08:46.494
The way I say it is,

258
00:08:46.494 --> 00:08:47.515
If I'm going 200 miles an hour,

259
00:08:47.515 --> 00:08:49.395
it's essential I put my attention on the road

260
00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:50.575
and where I'm going.

261
00:08:50.575 --> 00:08:52.315
So if our languaging is about,

262
00:08:52.315 --> 00:08:53.215
let's get rid of--

263
00:08:53.215 --> 00:08:54.915
let's not do, let's not be upset, let's--

264
00:08:54.915 --> 00:08:56.015
That's what isn't.

265
00:08:56.015 --> 00:08:57.175
And we go right off course again.

266
00:08:57.175 --> 00:09:00.035
Having a language of first-person personal,

267
00:09:00.035 --> 00:09:02.295
conscious creative, outcome-oriented,

268
00:09:02.295 --> 00:09:05.035
at the speed and rate we're moving,

269
00:09:05.035 --> 00:09:08.095
at the quality of connection going on,

270
00:09:08.095 --> 00:09:09.255
through our internet,

271
00:09:09.255 --> 00:09:12.055
through our mobile communications systems.

272
00:09:12.055 --> 00:09:13.515
The amount of our world,

273
00:09:13.515 --> 00:09:16.015
which is waking up to technology and communication,

274
00:09:16.015 --> 00:09:18.495
I believe it's essential to thrive,

275
00:09:18.495 --> 00:09:20.215
actually to exist, to make it,

276
00:09:20.215 --> 00:09:22.435
we move from a domain of separation,

277
00:09:22.435 --> 00:09:24.135
of limitation and struggle and lacking

278
00:09:24.135 --> 00:09:26.836
you and me, and God is outside of us,

279
00:09:26.836 --> 00:09:28.675
and our supply is outside of us,

280
00:09:28.675 --> 00:09:31.195
to a language system, a belief system,

281
00:09:31.195 --> 00:09:34.695
an ability to communicated of "I am that I am."

282
00:09:34.695 --> 00:09:35.875
My love is here.

283
00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:38.035
My Creator is within me, etc.

284
00:09:38.035 --> 00:09:39.375
That's why it's so important right now.

285
00:09:39.375 --> 00:09:40.885
<v Woman>And people are tired</v>

286
00:09:40.885 --> 00:09:42.386
of the feelings of separation.

287
00:09:42.386 --> 00:09:44.406
I mean, in short, I think we're all fed up

288
00:09:44.406 --> 00:09:46.706
with feeling separate, feeling alienated,

289
00:09:46.706 --> 00:09:48.686
feeling them against us.

290
00:09:48.686 --> 00:09:50.166
It's not working.

291
00:09:50.166 --> 00:09:53.846
We can't really prosper going that direction anymore.

292
00:09:53.846 --> 00:09:54.876
<v ->That's correct.</v>

293
00:09:54.876 --> 00:09:58.307
<v Woman>So I would like to take the languaging</v>

294
00:09:58.307 --> 00:10:00.987
into another area that a lot of people

295
00:10:00.987 --> 00:10:03.627
have been working on for decades now,

296
00:10:03.627 --> 00:10:06.887
since a lot of meditation books came into print,

297
00:10:06.887 --> 00:10:09.007
which is visioning,

298
00:10:09.007 --> 00:10:12.067
imagining, whatever you wish to call it,

299
00:10:12.067 --> 00:10:14.187
a better future for ourselves,

300
00:10:14.187 --> 00:10:15.987
and a practice of doing this,

301
00:10:15.987 --> 00:10:17.987
which seems to be--

302
00:10:17.987 --> 00:10:20.768
it seems to fall short in most cases.

303
00:10:20.768 --> 00:10:23.387
Can you tell us what real imagining of a--

304
00:10:23.387 --> 00:10:26.587
of who we are and what we desire is?

305
00:10:26.587 --> 00:10:28.127
Versus what we've been doing.

306
00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:29.427
<v ->I'll share with you my path.</v>

307
00:10:29.427 --> 00:10:32.107
I'd discovered my languaging peace

308
00:10:32.107 --> 00:10:33.768
and being specific, etc.

309
00:10:33.768 --> 00:10:36.427
and it worked half the time, for me.

310
00:10:36.427 --> 00:10:38.449
And the people I worked with, half the time.

311
00:10:38.449 --> 00:10:39.849
Then I read the work of Neville

312
00:10:39.849 --> 00:10:41.029
who wrote a number of books,

313
00:10:41.029 --> 00:10:42.249
"Seedtime and Harvest,"

314
00:10:42.249 --> 00:10:43.909
"Your Faith is Your Fortune", etc.

315
00:10:43.909 --> 00:10:46.490
And in a nutshell, Neville says to imagine

316
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.709
from the wish fulfilled,

317
00:10:48.709 --> 00:10:50.689
not of it, toward it or about it,

318
00:10:50.689 --> 00:10:51.651
which is the capstone.

319
00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.071
I mean, I already had everything in place

320
00:10:53.071 --> 00:10:56.331
except for this one state of imagining from

321
00:10:56.331 --> 00:10:57.701
instead of toward so I--

322
00:10:57.701 --> 00:10:59.133
<v Woman>So really simply...</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

323
00:10:59.133 --> 00:11:00.306
<v Woman>Tell us what that was like in your head</v>

324
00:11:00.306 --> 00:11:02.006
and what you transformed it into.

325
00:11:02.006 --> 00:11:03.045
<v ->Well, what I realized--</v>

326
00:11:03.045 --> 00:11:05.086
I'll give you a couple of examples.

327
00:11:05.086 --> 00:11:07.106
If my goal, if I was imagining

328
00:11:07.106 --> 00:11:09.826
having an amount of money,

329
00:11:09.826 --> 00:11:12.586
I would still be at getting the money,

330
00:11:12.586 --> 00:11:13.525
even though I have my money,

331
00:11:13.525 --> 00:11:14.626
that was fine.

332
00:11:14.626 --> 00:11:16.166
What Neville said wasn't

333
00:11:16.166 --> 00:11:17.166
"have the money."

334
00:11:17.166 --> 00:11:20.846
He said imagine from having the money.

335
00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:22.206
And what I realize, for me, is...

336
00:11:22.206 --> 00:11:25.166
Oh, oh, my subconscious gets

337
00:11:25.166 --> 00:11:27.746
where I'm imagining from,

338
00:11:27.746 --> 00:11:29.746
when I'm imagining from.

339
00:11:29.746 --> 00:11:32.606
So my subconscious is not bound by space or time.

340
00:11:32.606 --> 00:11:33.986
So I had the languaging,

341
00:11:33.986 --> 00:11:35.766
instead "I want money," "I have money"

342
00:11:35.766 --> 00:11:37.986
but I didn't prove I have my money

343
00:11:37.986 --> 00:11:41.006
by using my will and my creativity to imagine,

344
00:11:41.006 --> 00:11:43.866
to trust enough, to actually go forth

345
00:11:43.866 --> 00:11:45.906
from my desired state,

346
00:11:45.906 --> 00:11:47.046
instead of figuring out

347
00:11:47.046 --> 00:11:49.386
how my desired state is gonna happen.

348
00:11:49.386 --> 00:11:52.736
So the subtle shift for me is--

349
00:11:52.736 --> 00:11:54.489
I found my beloved wife when, you know,

350
00:11:54.489 --> 00:11:56.209
I was looking, looking, looking for,

351
00:11:56.209 --> 00:11:57.429
which means I don't have,

352
00:11:57.429 --> 00:11:59.389
my beloved and I finally just said,

353
00:11:59.389 --> 00:12:01.489
I found a statement in my own heart,

354
00:12:01.489 --> 00:12:03.249
it's already in our own heart.

355
00:12:03.249 --> 00:12:07.029
And I said, "I am my life of love. I am my love life."

356
00:12:07.029 --> 00:12:09.209
And 10 days later, we were engaged.

357
00:12:09.209 --> 00:12:09.803
<v Woman>(chuckles)</v>

358
00:12:09.803 --> 00:12:12.483
<v ->Now I shifted from "I am my perfect partner."</v>

359
00:12:12.483 --> 00:12:14.123
'Cause I didn't know what perfect meant.

360
00:12:14.123 --> 00:12:15.443
I didn't have an idea for that.

361
00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:16.603
To what my heart said,

362
00:12:16.603 --> 00:12:18.023
"I am my love life, my life of love."

363
00:12:18.023 --> 00:12:19.437
Boom. And I had her.

364
00:12:19.437 --> 00:12:20.957
We were already together.

365
00:12:20.957 --> 00:12:23.877
There is a state of consciousness,

366
00:12:23.877 --> 00:12:25.237
which we can enter,

367
00:12:25.237 --> 00:12:28.537
where we already have what we desire.

368
00:12:28.537 --> 00:12:30.997
And I have it in a system

369
00:12:30.997 --> 00:12:32.137
to share with my planet.

370
00:12:32.137 --> 00:12:34.587
I do it all day long.

371
00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:37.201
<v Woman>So we're in that state,</v>

372
00:12:37.201 --> 00:12:41.121
where we are, we're experiencing that which,

373
00:12:41.121 --> 00:12:44.141
quote we have desired, but we're now experiencing

374
00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:46.179
and coming from that state.

375
00:12:46.179 --> 00:12:48.379
How do you do the practical shift?

376
00:12:48.379 --> 00:12:51.019
And I think this dogs a lot of people.

377
00:12:51.019 --> 00:12:54.199
How do you do the practical shift of being there

378
00:12:54.199 --> 00:12:59.199
and then coming into the 3D world and you sit down.

379
00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.149
You have to write your checks out.

380
00:13:01.149 --> 00:13:03.761
Maybe you don't have enough to cover them

381
00:13:03.761 --> 00:13:05.781
or whatever the problem is.

382
00:13:05.781 --> 00:13:07.061
<v ->The first thing I do is,</v>

383
00:13:07.061 --> 00:13:08.841
you said it perfectly, is most people--

384
00:13:08.841 --> 00:13:10.541
how do I be there?

385
00:13:10.541 --> 00:13:12.661
Which means that there is not here.

386
00:13:12.661 --> 00:13:13.921
That's part of the languaging peace.

387
00:13:13.921 --> 00:13:16.122
So I mean, I have a lot of coaching.

388
00:13:16.122 --> 00:13:18.742
One is A is current reality, in my system.

389
00:13:18.742 --> 00:13:22.242
Sub-A is avoided or suppressed current reality.

390
00:13:22.242 --> 00:13:26.902
Any goal set from outside of now will be off course.

391
00:13:26.902 --> 00:13:28.042
A-B is process.

392
00:13:28.042 --> 00:13:30.302
B is the outcome, which is what I had

393
00:13:30.302 --> 00:13:32.042
before I met the Neville work.

394
00:13:32.042 --> 00:13:33.382
B is the outcome.

395
00:13:33.382 --> 00:13:34.482
The key is--

396
00:13:34.482 --> 00:13:36.103
If I'm going to do my world,

397
00:13:36.103 --> 00:13:38.183
having my dream fulfilled

398
00:13:38.183 --> 00:13:41.824
by imagining from my outcome.

399
00:13:41.824 --> 00:13:44.104
From B, my goal, I imagine from it.

400
00:13:44.104 --> 00:13:45.684
I say, beyond B.

401
00:13:45.684 --> 00:13:47.674
Oh, I feel, I have, I relax, I experience--

402
00:13:47.674 --> 00:13:49.234
<v Woman>Let's say you are. You're there--</v>

403
00:13:49.234 --> 00:13:50.695
<v ->No, but this is more than just "are."</v>

404
00:13:50.695 --> 00:13:51.755
This is the trick.

405
00:13:51.755 --> 00:13:53.715
"I am here" is B.

406
00:13:53.715 --> 00:13:56.775
So when I am imagining from "I am it already."

407
00:13:56.775 --> 00:13:59.335
I wake up, my new world,

408
00:13:59.335 --> 00:14:00.755
I've experienced, and all of sudden,

409
00:14:00.755 --> 00:14:02.675
what will happen is there's a signal--

410
00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:03.936
Spirit breathes us.

411
00:14:03.936 --> 00:14:05.176
We take an automatic deep breath,

412
00:14:05.176 --> 00:14:06.585
or actually Spirit does it for us.

413
00:14:06.585 --> 00:14:08.487
It's not a taking, it's (exhale)

414
00:14:08.487 --> 00:14:10.131
and I breathe deep and I imagine from it.

415
00:14:10.131 --> 00:14:13.411
I'm relaxed, I'm comfortable, I go out a year or two.

416
00:14:13.411 --> 00:14:14.531
Then I ask myself,

417
00:14:14.531 --> 00:14:15.551
and this is a part of the system,

418
00:14:15.551 --> 00:14:17.011
What was the very first thing I did

419
00:14:17.011 --> 00:14:18.931
to give myself my new B?

420
00:14:18.931 --> 00:14:20.393
Which has become my current reality.

421
00:14:20.393 --> 00:14:21.753
"Oh, I called Aunt Martha."

422
00:14:21.753 --> 00:14:23.093
"I wrote a check."

423
00:14:23.093 --> 00:14:24.593
"I mowed the lawn."

424
00:14:24.593 --> 00:14:25.293
And those--

425
00:14:25.293 --> 00:14:27.753
I can actually tell myself

426
00:14:27.753 --> 00:14:29.673
what I did even though it hasn't been done yet

427
00:14:29.673 --> 00:14:31.073
except in my imagination,

428
00:14:31.073 --> 00:14:33.393
to get this and then I have my list of things to do.

429
00:14:33.393 --> 00:14:34.303
It's probably four, five, six--

430
00:14:34.303 --> 00:14:35.307
<v Woman>And that becomes your list.</v>

431
00:14:35.307 --> 00:14:38.309
<v ->And I go do those things in good faith,</v>

432
00:14:38.309 --> 00:14:41.079
they brought me my outcome and they do.

433
00:14:41.079 --> 00:14:44.601
<v Woman>So faith is really the missing piece.</v>

434
00:14:44.601 --> 00:14:45.961
<v ->Yes.</v>

435
00:14:45.961 --> 00:14:47.201
<v Woman>It has been the missing piece.</v>

436
00:14:47.201 --> 00:14:48.701
<v ->Yes.</v>

437
00:14:48.701 --> 00:14:51.425
Faith, grace, they're the same thing.

438
00:14:51.425 --> 00:14:53.565
<v Woman>How do you take a person</v>

439
00:14:53.565 --> 00:14:57.085
who is lacking faith and really wants to do this,

440
00:14:57.085 --> 00:14:59.505
really, really is going--

441
00:14:59.505 --> 00:15:00.325
<v ->Committed...</v>

442
00:15:00.325 --> 00:15:03.305
<v Woman>has committed to doing this.</v>

443
00:15:03.305 --> 00:15:05.245
What are the first triggers that happen?

444
00:15:05.245 --> 00:15:08.345
That inspire them to allow themselves to have faith?

445
00:15:08.345 --> 00:15:11.685
<v ->What I've found is there's a way to ask a question,</v>

446
00:15:11.685 --> 00:15:13.545
which elicits a healing response.

447
00:15:13.545 --> 00:15:16.185
It's the real magic of what I've found,

448
00:15:16.185 --> 00:15:17.045
I'll just put it this way.

449
00:15:17.045 --> 00:15:18.175
I know it already existed.

450
00:15:18.175 --> 00:15:19.237
I found it.

451
00:15:19.237 --> 00:15:20.417
So if somebody comes in

452
00:15:20.417 --> 00:15:22.097
and they don't have enough faith to get their outcome,

453
00:15:22.097 --> 00:15:23.477
and it's, you know, whatever it is,

454
00:15:23.477 --> 00:15:25.117
"dis-pair", which means not paired,

455
00:15:25.117 --> 00:15:27.757
you know, belief, where I've tried everything,

456
00:15:27.757 --> 00:15:29.117
which means their subconscious says,

457
00:15:29.117 --> 00:15:31.461
Okay, if they say I can't and I can prove it,

458
00:15:31.461 --> 00:15:33.061
their subconscious says, "Okay."

459
00:15:33.061 --> 00:15:34.321
So I say, "Well, now..."

460
00:15:34.321 --> 00:15:36.331
I don't go fix that glitch in them. I say--

461
00:15:36.331 --> 00:15:38.893
I ask them a question where it's already fixed.

462
00:15:38.893 --> 00:15:41.373
I say that now that you have faith,

463
00:15:41.373 --> 00:15:42.893
I didn't go get 'em faith,

464
00:15:42.893 --> 00:15:45.693
I say, I just go further in their consciousness,

465
00:15:45.693 --> 00:15:47.853
in their moment of now extended.

466
00:15:47.853 --> 00:15:49.673
Now that you have faith,

467
00:15:49.673 --> 00:15:50.972
and you're trusting,

468
00:15:50.972 --> 00:15:52.813
what's new and different in your world?

469
00:15:52.813 --> 00:15:54.753
Now that might be too big of a question.

470
00:15:54.753 --> 00:15:57.519
So you say, alright, imagine you've had faith for a year.

471
00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:59.679
If they're not readily able to do it,

472
00:15:59.679 --> 00:16:01.259
two years, three years, five years,

473
00:16:01.259 --> 00:16:02.819
sometimes it's 10 years.

474
00:16:02.819 --> 00:16:04.841
Oh, and that big breath happens.

475
00:16:04.841 --> 00:16:06.505
I now know Spirit just said yes.

476
00:16:06.505 --> 00:16:08.245
Somehow their whole being just said yes.

477
00:16:08.245 --> 00:16:10.325
Well, I'm relaxed, I'm comfortable.

478
00:16:10.325 --> 00:16:11.365
You know, they all--

479
00:16:11.365 --> 00:16:14.147
they enter a new set of consciousness.

480
00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:15.807
If the time goes out 10 years,

481
00:16:15.807 --> 00:16:17.407
or five or three or whatever it is,

482
00:16:17.407 --> 00:16:19.387
I go this distance because

483
00:16:19.387 --> 00:16:21.167
now their intellect doesn't have to figure

484
00:16:21.167 --> 00:16:22.769
they have to do something.

485
00:16:22.769 --> 00:16:24.069
I just shifted,

486
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:25.909
by asking them a question,

487
00:16:25.909 --> 00:16:29.149
shifted their consciousness to already having faith.

488
00:16:29.149 --> 00:16:30.749
And then they go embody faith.

489
00:16:30.749 --> 00:16:32.489
Now, I'm relaxed, I'm comfortable,

490
00:16:32.489 --> 00:16:34.529
I'm doing what I love to do, whatever it is.

491
00:16:34.529 --> 00:16:36.109
I don't go back and fix it yet,

492
00:16:36.109 --> 00:16:36.909
I go further.

493
00:16:36.909 --> 00:16:38.409
Well, now go forward.

494
00:16:38.409 --> 00:16:39.211
Now it's been another year,

495
00:16:39.211 --> 00:16:40.131
what's new and different?

496
00:16:40.131 --> 00:16:41.633
Pretty soon they begin to discover,

497
00:16:41.633 --> 00:16:43.753
they turn the lights on in their consciousness,

498
00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:46.293
of what their full-of-faith life is.

499
00:16:46.293 --> 00:16:47.633
The further they go,

500
00:16:47.633 --> 00:16:50.693
all of the fear states and doubt states,

501
00:16:50.693 --> 00:16:52.673
and confusion states they had before,

502
00:16:52.673 --> 00:16:53.613
starts to heal.

503
00:16:53.613 --> 00:16:55.113
They get emotional

504
00:16:55.113 --> 00:16:56.653
as they go forward.

505
00:16:56.653 --> 00:16:58.673
They move forward and forward and forward.

506
00:16:58.673 --> 00:17:01.693
I haven't gone to fix these specifically,

507
00:17:01.693 --> 00:17:02.563
you know, we're just--

508
00:17:02.563 --> 00:17:05.189
imagine quote, unquote, forward in their now,

509
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:08.570
they will take the energy trapped in their stuck-ness

510
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:09.653
stored in their body,

511
00:17:09.653 --> 00:17:11.433
and it will come to the surface.

512
00:17:11.433 --> 00:17:14.173
So it's much easier than going back and fixing the glitch.

513
00:17:14.173 --> 00:17:17.333
I go forward to where the glitch is fixed

514
00:17:17.333 --> 00:17:18.613
and then from there--

515
00:17:18.613 --> 00:17:19.953
<v Woman>The new energetics are created there.</v>

516
00:17:19.953 --> 00:17:20.853
<v ->Yes.</v>

517
00:17:20.853 --> 00:17:23.633
And they withdraw and as I grab the energy,

518
00:17:23.633 --> 00:17:25.393
we can't get rid of energy

519
00:17:25.393 --> 00:17:27.453
so we're not gonna get rid of doubt.

520
00:17:27.453 --> 00:17:29.333
We're gonna actually transform doubt.

521
00:17:29.333 --> 00:17:30.373
It's energy.

522
00:17:30.373 --> 00:17:31.853
We can re-claim it.

523
00:17:31.853 --> 00:17:33.133
And send it forward.

524
00:17:33.133 --> 00:17:35.513
<v Woman>So you can go back from that point.</v>

525
00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:37.813
Now you are in faith,

526
00:17:37.813 --> 00:17:41.763
you are embodying faith.

527
00:17:41.763 --> 00:17:44.184
You can look back, as you said, a little bit earlier,

528
00:17:44.184 --> 00:17:45.824
at the elements of how--

529
00:17:45.824 --> 00:17:46.504
<v ->Yep.</v>

530
00:17:46.504 --> 00:17:48.824
<v Woman>you reached the place you are.</v>

531
00:17:48.824 --> 00:17:49.724
<v ->Yeah.</v>

532
00:17:49.724 --> 00:17:50.318
<v Woman>I see.</v>

533
00:17:50.318 --> 00:17:52.558
<v ->And it's a list of what did I do to get there--</v>

534
00:17:52.558 --> 00:17:53.978
<v Woman>What did I do to get here.</v>

535
00:17:53.978 --> 00:17:55.203
What did I do to get here.

536
00:17:55.203 --> 00:17:57.383
<v ->And the miracle for me is, like in neurolinguistics,</v>

537
00:17:57.383 --> 00:17:59.492
if we look left, it's a memory, if we look right--

538
00:17:59.492 --> 00:18:01.272
when I coach people, I teach this all in my classes,

539
00:18:01.272 --> 00:18:02.762
to do it with each other.

540
00:18:02.762 --> 00:18:03.702
When a person says,

541
00:18:03.702 --> 00:18:04.752
"What was the first thing you did?"

542
00:18:04.752 --> 00:18:05.985
"Well, I--" and they'll look left.

543
00:18:05.985 --> 00:18:07.025
They'll remember something.

544
00:18:07.025 --> 00:18:09.165
They won't create it, they'll remember what they did.

545
00:18:09.165 --> 00:18:11.525
So it changes our neurology.

546
00:18:11.525 --> 00:18:15.495
It's a fact already, which is so powerful.

547
00:18:15.495 --> 00:18:17.797
<v Woman>And it's not just word.</v>

548
00:18:17.797 --> 00:18:19.757
It's also other elements of our life,

549
00:18:19.757 --> 00:18:23.017
that feed into this and help support

550
00:18:23.017 --> 00:18:25.077
our being now, here now,

551
00:18:25.077 --> 00:18:25.977
<v ->Yes. Yes.</v>

552
00:18:25.977 --> 00:18:27.817
<v Woman>in our desired state.</v>

553
00:18:27.817 --> 00:18:28.940
Can you talk about some

554
00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.780
of the other supportive elements of our lives?

555
00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.240
<v ->Well, for me, I work with nutrition</v>

556
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.642
as it relates to consciousness.

557
00:18:34.642 --> 00:18:37.142
I work with our emotion as it turns into motion.

558
00:18:37.142 --> 00:18:38.202
When I say body--

559
00:18:38.202 --> 00:18:39.183
Feeling is the bottom line.

560
00:18:39.183 --> 00:18:41.502
What we feel deeply is what exists.

561
00:18:41.502 --> 00:18:43.902
So if I think about a new goal,

562
00:18:43.902 --> 00:18:45.602
I'm only thinking about it.

563
00:18:45.602 --> 00:18:47.722
If I imagine getting to the goal,

564
00:18:47.722 --> 00:18:49.182
I'm just up to it.

565
00:18:49.182 --> 00:18:53.002
If I eat, receive, enjoy my goal,

566
00:18:53.002 --> 00:18:56.162
I have it yet I'm still connected to what I don't have.

567
00:18:56.162 --> 00:18:59.582
If I imagine from it, now I've shifted my reality.

568
00:18:59.582 --> 00:19:01.742
Imagining from my new goal and my imagination,

569
00:19:01.742 --> 00:19:03.562
I feel new.

570
00:19:03.562 --> 00:19:06.432
So I use 16 senses, you know?

571
00:19:06.432 --> 00:19:08.576
Sense, sound, taste, smell, touch,

572
00:19:08.576 --> 00:19:10.498
motion, direction, there's a lot to it.

573
00:19:10.498 --> 00:19:13.458
And sometimes, if somebody can see it and hear it,

574
00:19:13.458 --> 00:19:14.518
that's great.

575
00:19:14.518 --> 00:19:17.719
And when they add maybe, smell it, you know?

576
00:19:17.719 --> 00:19:19.219
One more sense, all of a sudden,

577
00:19:19.219 --> 00:19:21.499
it actually happens and they're in their great--

578
00:19:21.499 --> 00:19:22.999
they're weeping usually.

579
00:19:22.999 --> 00:19:25.319
Or some shift happens in their body.

580
00:19:25.319 --> 00:19:26.659
Their body chemistry changes.

581
00:19:26.659 --> 00:19:28.639
If we were to do live cell analysis,

582
00:19:28.639 --> 00:19:30.059
like looking at the blood,

583
00:19:30.059 --> 00:19:31.918
their blood will change, before and after.

584
00:19:31.918 --> 00:19:33.679
The iris of the eye will change frequently,

585
00:19:33.679 --> 00:19:34.941
the sclera of their eye.

586
00:19:34.941 --> 00:19:37.381
Their DNA potentially is shifting,

587
00:19:37.381 --> 00:19:40.141
if our iris changes, which I study,

588
00:19:40.141 --> 00:19:41.901
if our iris changes its structure,

589
00:19:41.901 --> 00:19:43.501
I know we change somethin'.

590
00:19:43.501 --> 00:19:45.281
We change some belief system,

591
00:19:45.281 --> 00:19:47.961
even genetic, and we can change it.

592
00:19:47.961 --> 00:19:49.641
You know, we're just an energy system.

593
00:19:49.641 --> 00:19:51.341
We are not bound by our history.

594
00:19:51.341 --> 00:19:52.181
<v Woman>And these are choices.</v>

595
00:19:52.181 --> 00:19:53.341
Every word is a choice.

596
00:19:53.341 --> 00:19:53.861
<v ->Yes.</v>

597
00:19:53.861 --> 00:19:56.221
<v Woman>It's just that we're so programmed already.</v>

598
00:19:56.221 --> 00:19:57.911
We have to know--

599
00:19:57.911 --> 00:19:58.853
transcend.

600
00:19:58.853 --> 00:19:59.813
<v ->Yes. Time to wake up.</v>

601
00:19:59.813 --> 00:20:00.533
<v Woman>Time to wake up</v>

602
00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:02.177
and transcend our choice of words

603
00:20:02.177 --> 00:20:04.577
and we were talking before we started taping,

604
00:20:04.577 --> 00:20:07.157
and I noticed some emotions coming up as we were--

605
00:20:07.157 --> 00:20:08.337
you were asking me questions,

606
00:20:08.337 --> 00:20:10.137
showing me how this system works

607
00:20:10.137 --> 00:20:11.997
on a more personal level.

608
00:20:11.997 --> 00:20:15.917
And you asked me about my goal.

609
00:20:15.917 --> 00:20:19.077
Where I'm very clear on what I'm here to do

610
00:20:19.077 --> 00:20:22.697
but I start hedging and putting separation

611
00:20:22.697 --> 00:20:25.757
through my words between what I know I am versus

612
00:20:25.757 --> 00:20:29.261
what I'm trying to tell you I would like to be, for example.

613
00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:33.723
What is this false modesty, this guilt, this whatever

614
00:20:33.723 --> 00:20:35.803
that has really been,

615
00:20:35.803 --> 00:20:37.463
that has permeated us?

616
00:20:37.463 --> 00:20:39.523
I know some of it comes from religion,

617
00:20:39.523 --> 00:20:40.843
comes from parents and whatnot,

618
00:20:40.843 --> 00:20:43.523
but at large, what have we done to ourselves?

619
00:20:43.523 --> 00:20:44.443
<v ->Yeah, that's a big--</v>

620
00:20:44.443 --> 00:20:46.395
that's a beautiful question.

621
00:20:48.145 --> 00:20:48.769
Here's my take on it.

622
00:20:48.769 --> 00:20:52.109
By believing in separation,

623
00:20:52.109 --> 00:20:54.309
by, you know, my God is outside of me

624
00:20:54.309 --> 00:20:55.489
and I have to go somewhere to get it,

625
00:20:55.489 --> 00:20:57.189
or my money's outside of me, I have to go get it,

626
00:20:57.189 --> 00:20:58.189
that kind of stuff.

627
00:20:58.189 --> 00:21:01.309
Pretty soon, we begin to realize who we are.

628
00:21:01.309 --> 00:21:04.508
And yet, sometimes those around us aren't comfortable

629
00:21:04.508 --> 00:21:07.899
with our genius, our power, our creativity, our confidence.

630
00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:09.353
I remember the time and the space,

631
00:21:09.353 --> 00:21:11.193
the moment I gave up some of my genius

632
00:21:11.193 --> 00:21:13.683
just to be comfortable, to be on the playground

633
00:21:13.683 --> 00:21:15.285
in middle school.

634
00:21:15.285 --> 00:21:17.445
And I've asked many, many people the same thing

635
00:21:17.445 --> 00:21:18.465
and they remember.

636
00:21:18.465 --> 00:21:19.845
They gave something up.

637
00:21:19.845 --> 00:21:23.165
At some point, we as a humanity, or as an individual,

638
00:21:23.165 --> 00:21:26.465
or as a collective, whatever we are, go

639
00:21:26.465 --> 00:21:28.045
"Are we gonna worry--

640
00:21:28.045 --> 00:21:30.425
"Find our lowest common denominator?

641
00:21:30.425 --> 00:21:33.125
Or are we gonna be our highest common denominator?"

642
00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:35.405
Do I need to make those around me comfortable

643
00:21:35.405 --> 00:21:38.625
by belittling, or by being politically correct?

644
00:21:38.625 --> 00:21:40.745
Or, that's serving outside,

645
00:21:40.745 --> 00:21:43.105
if I serve my own heart,

646
00:21:43.105 --> 00:21:46.025
will the love within my own heart bless everyone.

647
00:21:46.025 --> 00:21:47.285
My experience, yes.

648
00:21:47.285 --> 00:21:49.665
It's the only true win-win,

649
00:21:49.665 --> 00:21:52.085
is by me winning as well as empowering win.

650
00:21:52.085 --> 00:21:53.705
It's called love, is my take.

651
00:21:53.705 --> 00:21:56.205
<v Woman>So we have to stop</v>

652
00:21:56.205 --> 00:21:58.025
keeping ourselves small from--

653
00:21:58.025 --> 00:22:01.615
and hidden from our own truth of what we have,

654
00:22:01.615 --> 00:22:03.131
<v ->And in languaging,
<v Woman>what we are.</v>

655
00:22:03.131 --> 00:22:05.072
instead of "we have to stop,"

656
00:22:05.072 --> 00:22:09.691
I say, "Let's start serving love and our one-ness again."

657
00:22:09.691 --> 00:22:11.412
To have to stop is just like--

658
00:22:11.412 --> 00:22:12.292
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

659
00:22:12.292 --> 00:22:13.812
<v ->We're beings of what is.</v>

660
00:22:13.812 --> 00:22:15.812
Conscious language is a language of what is,

661
00:22:15.812 --> 00:22:17.711
and when we tell kids, "Stop doing that."

662
00:22:17.711 --> 00:22:18.472
They'll go do it.

663
00:22:18.472 --> 00:22:19.091
"Don't come in late."

664
00:22:19.091 --> 00:22:20.505
"How late? Is three too late?"

665
00:22:20.505 --> 00:22:21.945
And then, you know, I did that all the time.

666
00:22:21.945 --> 00:22:23.346
I'd come in too late.

667
00:22:23.346 --> 00:22:24.526
And yet, if somebody says,

668
00:22:24.526 --> 00:22:27.026
"Please be home on time to keep our family agreements."

669
00:22:27.026 --> 00:22:28.546
Ooo, okay.

670
00:22:28.546 --> 00:22:29.846
It's different.

671
00:22:29.846 --> 00:22:30.866
<v Woman>Rather than "Don't you be late."</v>

672
00:22:30.866 --> 00:22:31.625
<v ->That's right.</v>

673
00:22:31.625 --> 00:22:32.446
<v Woman>Hmm-mm.</v>

674
00:22:32.446 --> 00:22:33.566
<v ->Or don't think about pink elephants</v>

675
00:22:33.566 --> 00:22:35.878
with purple polka dots, which we immediately do.

676
00:22:35.878 --> 00:22:38.078
<v Woman>So "don't" and "isn't" would be</v>

677
00:22:38.078 --> 00:22:40.807
a couple of the words that are off the list immediately.

678
00:22:40.807 --> 00:22:42.010
<v ->That's right. Yes.</v>

679
00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:43.482
Yeah, like isn't, wouldn't, couldn't, shouldn't, didn't,

680
00:22:43.482 --> 00:22:45.342
are is not, would not, could not, should--

681
00:22:45.342 --> 00:22:47.362
so "Is not this a beautiful day?"

682
00:22:47.362 --> 00:22:49.021
is a what we're saying when we say,

683
00:22:49.021 --> 00:22:50.562
"Isn't this a beautiful day?"

684
00:22:50.562 --> 00:22:51.562
Let's say what is.

685
00:22:51.562 --> 00:22:52.941
"It is a beautiful day."

686
00:22:52.941 --> 00:22:54.582
Let's get into the language of what is,

687
00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:56.242
which is the language of now,

688
00:22:56.242 --> 00:22:57.762
which is the language of God.

689
00:22:57.762 --> 00:22:59.102
<v Woman>So it changes it from a question</v>

690
00:22:59.102 --> 00:23:00.312
to a statement.

691
00:23:00.312 --> 00:23:03.041
Don't we make the--

692
00:23:03.041 --> 00:23:04.742
Don't we make that conversion ourselves,

693
00:23:04.742 --> 00:23:07.582
taking what would be a direct statement into a question,

694
00:23:07.582 --> 00:23:10.542
again, just to be polite, to be modest,

695
00:23:10.542 --> 00:23:12.902
to feel as though we're engaging someone else?

696
00:23:12.902 --> 00:23:15.841
"Isn't it a lovely day?" versus "It's a lovely day."

697
00:23:15.841 --> 00:23:17.302
<v ->Or even saying, "Is it a lovely day?"</v>

698
00:23:17.302 --> 00:23:18.382
Go direct and--

699
00:23:18.382 --> 00:23:19.662
a lot of people, when they learn languaging,

700
00:23:19.662 --> 00:23:21.742
say, "Whoa, this is really direct."

701
00:23:21.742 --> 00:23:22.442
Okay.

702
00:23:22.442 --> 00:23:23.295
<v Woman>Very direct.</v>

703
00:23:23.295 --> 00:23:24.075
<v ->Let's be direct.</v>

704
00:23:24.075 --> 00:23:25.975
<v Woman>We're not comfortable with being that direct.</v>

705
00:23:25.975 --> 00:23:26.675
<v ->In the past.</v>

706
00:23:26.675 --> 00:23:28.575
I choose to be comfortable being direct.

707
00:23:28.575 --> 00:23:30.484
I mean, just for a statement of outcome.

708
00:23:30.484 --> 00:23:32.166
You know, the idea to need

709
00:23:32.166 --> 00:23:35.306
to keep everybody comfortable doesn't work anyway.

710
00:23:35.306 --> 00:23:38.696
<v Woman>It's true because we're not comfortable ourselves.</v>

711
00:23:38.696 --> 00:23:41.613
<v ->There's only one true comfort and it's within us.</v>

712
00:23:43.563 --> 00:23:45.435
<v Woman>There are other things you do as well.</v>

713
00:23:45.435 --> 00:23:46.995
One of them is essential oils.

714
00:23:46.995 --> 00:23:51.195
To help support, staying in this presence,

715
00:23:51.195 --> 00:23:53.215
this impeccable presence.

716
00:23:53.215 --> 00:23:54.415
Can you talk a little bit about

717
00:23:54.415 --> 00:23:56.795
how essential oils play into this?

718
00:23:56.795 --> 00:23:57.875
<v ->Yeah, actually--
<v Woman>It would seem</v>

719
00:23:57.875 --> 00:23:59.888
somewhat incongruous but it's not.

720
00:23:59.888 --> 00:24:02.479
<v ->Well, it's all frequency.</v>

721
00:24:02.479 --> 00:24:06.494
Way back in, boy, 70's,

722
00:24:06.494 --> 00:24:09.114
in the early 70's, mid-70's, I started a company

723
00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:11.054
called Back to Eden, to honor Jethro Kloss

724
00:24:11.054 --> 00:24:13.174
who wrote the book "Back to Eden" about herbs.

725
00:24:13.174 --> 00:24:16.454
And I started carrying all the essential oils I could get.

726
00:24:16.454 --> 00:24:17.734
And I studied with a woman

727
00:24:17.734 --> 00:24:21.234
by the name of Marion Jager who used essential oils,

728
00:24:21.234 --> 00:24:23.094
pure ones, to help in,

729
00:24:23.094 --> 00:24:25.854
like a limited belief system, when I studied with her,

730
00:24:25.854 --> 00:24:27.794
a limited thought form, she would call them,

731
00:24:27.794 --> 00:24:29.693
have a negative vortex.

732
00:24:29.693 --> 00:24:32.834
Essential oils, the blood of the plant, natural,

733
00:24:32.834 --> 00:24:34.674
have a positive vortex.

734
00:24:34.674 --> 00:24:37.934
So she was able to find certain types of frequencies,

735
00:24:37.934 --> 00:24:41.604
negative frequencies, apply oil to them, and--

736
00:24:41.604 --> 00:24:44.035
like peppermint, as an example in her system,

737
00:24:44.035 --> 00:24:47.195
was the dominant type and wintergreen was for those

738
00:24:47.195 --> 00:24:49.115
who had fear of being dominated.

739
00:24:49.115 --> 00:24:50.455
And she would demonstrate this all day long.

740
00:24:50.455 --> 00:24:52.055
A couple would come in, one's dominant,

741
00:24:52.055 --> 00:24:53.695
one has fear of being dominated.

742
00:24:53.695 --> 00:24:55.854
She would put peppermint oil on the dominant one.

743
00:24:55.854 --> 00:24:57.435
Wintergreen on the back of the neck.

744
00:24:57.435 --> 00:24:59.115
Peppermint here for the dominant one.

745
00:24:59.115 --> 00:25:01.235
Wintergreen on the back of the neck

746
00:25:01.235 --> 00:25:02.775
for the fear of being dominated

747
00:25:02.775 --> 00:25:05.355
and all of a sudden, the roles will reverse.

748
00:25:05.355 --> 00:25:07.268
<v Woman>Seriously?</v>
<v ->Really, and I just--</v>

749
00:25:07.268 --> 00:25:08.780
I know, from my experience,

750
00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.682
that energy, the vortex of the energy of negative

751
00:25:11.682 --> 00:25:13.694
for the dominant turned positive.

752
00:25:13.694 --> 00:25:14.504
Cool 'em off.

753
00:25:14.504 --> 00:25:15.446
I mean, they'd be going "Aw-ah."

754
00:25:15.446 --> 00:25:16.926
'Cause they would change their energy

755
00:25:16.926 --> 00:25:18.606
and the fear of being dominated,

756
00:25:18.606 --> 00:25:20.146
back of the neck for that person,

757
00:25:20.146 --> 00:25:21.846
they'd start to have courage and confidence.

758
00:25:21.846 --> 00:25:25.206
So you know, there's a whole system of beautiful oils,

759
00:25:25.206 --> 00:25:27.426
blood of the plant, you know, it's been said,

760
00:25:27.426 --> 00:25:30.006
when a man is low on faith, feed him herbs.

761
00:25:30.006 --> 00:25:32.566
So you know, herbs and essential oils,

762
00:25:32.566 --> 00:25:33.786
that's the blood of the plant,

763
00:25:33.786 --> 00:25:36.126
it's the highest frequency within the plant.

764
00:25:36.126 --> 00:25:38.386
And right now, it's time to restore

765
00:25:38.386 --> 00:25:41.886
faith, trust, security, assured-ness, hope,

766
00:25:41.886 --> 00:25:44.426
honor, valor, that kind of stuff.

767
00:25:44.426 --> 00:25:46.326
So you know, that's the beauty of having--

768
00:25:46.326 --> 00:25:48.376
<v Woman>Is this absolute?</v>

769
00:25:48.376 --> 00:25:52.268
In particular, I've used essential oils for years for--

770
00:25:52.268 --> 00:25:53.320
to make myself--

771
00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.960
lift my spirits up,

772
00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.856
or to get rid of a sour stomach or whatever.

773
00:25:59.856 --> 00:26:02.128
But are you saying when you use peppermint,

774
00:26:02.128 --> 00:26:03.588
for example, on your forehead,

775
00:26:03.588 --> 00:26:06.388
that this is an absolute with most human beings,

776
00:26:06.388 --> 00:26:08.448
in terms of their reaction to it.

777
00:26:08.448 --> 00:26:10.428
<v ->Well, or action.
<v Woman>Or their action.</v>

778
00:26:10.428 --> 00:26:12.348
<v ->I don't work in the world of absolute.</v>

779
00:26:12.348 --> 00:26:14.958
I just say that it can benefit many and try it, you know,

780
00:26:14.958 --> 00:26:16.834
"prove all things and hold fast to that which is good."

781
00:26:16.834 --> 00:26:18.524
<v Woman>But by and large,</v>
<v ->By and large, yes.</v>

782
00:26:18.524 --> 00:26:20.030
<v Woman>these principles apply and you've seen this--</v>

783
00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:21.262
<v ->Yes, very much so.
<v Woman>in your own practice.</v>

784
00:26:21.262 --> 00:26:23.625
<v ->Yeah, in fact, every couple hours, in my events, I'll--</v>

785
00:26:23.625 --> 00:26:25.785
I usually pass out peppermint. People--

786
00:26:25.785 --> 00:26:26.779
After a while, they're going--

787
00:26:26.779 --> 00:26:27.979
You know, 'cause they know it.

788
00:26:27.979 --> 00:26:28.759
It works.

789
00:26:28.759 --> 00:26:31.359
It clears, or it wakes up, or inspires.

790
00:26:31.359 --> 00:26:34.959
<v Woman>Yes, I love peppermint and wintergreen both.</v>

791
00:26:34.959 --> 00:26:37.179
Going along into the subject of fear

792
00:26:37.179 --> 00:26:39.599
because I think most people must find their way to you

793
00:26:39.599 --> 00:26:41.339
because there's something in their being

794
00:26:41.339 --> 00:26:42.879
that they're fearful of,

795
00:26:42.879 --> 00:26:44.539
whether it's not to have a--

796
00:26:44.539 --> 00:26:46.659
to not have the relationship they want,

797
00:26:46.659 --> 00:26:51.319
or to be in fear about a family dynamic, or finances.

798
00:26:51.319 --> 00:26:52.879
But the way you put it is,

799
00:26:52.879 --> 00:26:55.779
fear is faith returning.

800
00:26:55.779 --> 00:26:56.739
What does that mean?

801
00:26:56.739 --> 00:27:00.019
<v ->Well, in my discovery, as people would move upscale,</v>

802
00:27:00.019 --> 00:27:04.299
I woke up to this notion that every emotion,

803
00:27:04.299 --> 00:27:07.319
I'm gonna call it, against love,

804
00:27:07.319 --> 00:27:09.101
you know, like there's only one true motion in life

805
00:27:09.101 --> 00:27:09.841
and that's love.

806
00:27:09.841 --> 00:27:12.721
Everything else is an emotion, that's my view of it.

807
00:27:12.721 --> 00:27:15.221
So fear, when we have fear,

808
00:27:15.221 --> 00:27:18.921
we actually have faith that got suppressed.

809
00:27:18.921 --> 00:27:20.041
If we have anger,

810
00:27:20.041 --> 00:27:23.131
we have action, authority and loving,

811
00:27:23.131 --> 00:27:25.003
let's say, forgiveness, suppressed.

812
00:27:25.003 --> 00:27:28.083
So somebody's in a state of fear, as an example,

813
00:27:28.083 --> 00:27:31.123
that's really the frequency of courage, confidence, faith,

814
00:27:31.123 --> 00:27:32.963
assured-ness, trust, etc.

815
00:27:32.963 --> 00:27:37.963
So if I'm with somebody about their emotion,

816
00:27:37.963 --> 00:27:40.283
usually it's, if somebody says, "I'm terrified."

817
00:27:40.283 --> 00:27:42.203
I say, "Are you feeling it or avoiding it?"

818
00:27:42.203 --> 00:27:43.883
Ultimately, they'll say, "I'm either hating it,

819
00:27:43.883 --> 00:27:45.263
"avoiding it or trying to get rid of it."

820
00:27:45.263 --> 00:27:46.845
Which means they're not feeling it.

821
00:27:46.845 --> 00:27:48.965
So when we get present with something

822
00:27:48.965 --> 00:27:52.685
being made of God, spirit of light and love,

823
00:27:52.685 --> 00:27:53.915
when we touch our fear,

824
00:27:53.915 --> 00:27:56.735
all of a sudden, our fear loses its power.

825
00:27:56.735 --> 00:27:58.971
When we know what our fear turns into,

826
00:27:58.971 --> 00:28:00.451
it's like replacement therapy.

827
00:28:00.451 --> 00:28:03.031
When we know our fear actually is our courage

828
00:28:03.031 --> 00:28:04.771
or faith or trust returning,

829
00:28:04.771 --> 00:28:08.011
we can touch it with love, announcing,

830
00:28:08.011 --> 00:28:09.771
we take authority over the energy

831
00:28:09.771 --> 00:28:11.291
and turn it into something.

832
00:28:11.291 --> 00:28:13.111
So now, it's like an akito move.

833
00:28:13.111 --> 00:28:15.871
People feel, I remember calling a person,

834
00:28:15.871 --> 00:28:17.531
one time, somebody had done a training,

835
00:28:17.531 --> 00:28:18.581
I said, "Hey, how're doing?"

836
00:28:18.581 --> 00:28:22.885
He goes, "I have massive courage returning."

837
00:28:22.885 --> 00:28:24.275
Which means he was actually

838
00:28:24.275 --> 00:28:25.985
experiencing terror in his life

839
00:28:25.985 --> 00:28:27.356
<v Woman>(chuckles)</v>
<v ->or he knew what it was.</v>

840
00:28:27.356 --> 00:28:29.496
So the beauty of understanding what

841
00:28:29.496 --> 00:28:31.856
like grief turns into joy.

842
00:28:31.856 --> 00:28:32.736
Once we know that, we know,

843
00:28:32.736 --> 00:28:34.076
"Oh, if I've got a lot of grief up,

844
00:28:34.076 --> 00:28:34.996
"I'm really--

845
00:28:34.996 --> 00:28:36.676
"it's pushing up because joy is attempting

846
00:28:36.676 --> 00:28:38.751
"to get back into my life."

847
00:28:38.751 --> 00:28:41.851
<v Woman>So we can look at it almost in reverse.</v>

848
00:28:41.851 --> 00:28:44.491
If we have fear, this means that we have courage

849
00:28:44.491 --> 00:28:46.775
that's returning to our life.
<v ->Yes, and to claim it.</v>

850
00:28:46.775 --> 00:28:48.475
<v Woman>And if we have not enough,</v>

851
00:28:48.475 --> 00:28:49.675
that means abundances--

852
00:28:49.675 --> 00:28:50.315
<v ->Exactly.</v>

853
00:28:50.315 --> 00:28:51.355
<v Woman>popping up.</v>

854
00:28:51.355 --> 00:28:54.375
That's attempting to, or it is returning to our life.

855
00:28:54.375 --> 00:28:55.555
<v ->I'll give you an example.</v>

856
00:28:55.555 --> 00:28:56.675
I learned this when--

857
00:28:56.675 --> 00:28:58.375
Scripture says, "Our greatest weakness

858
00:28:58.375 --> 00:29:00.115
"shall be our greatest strength."

859
00:29:00.115 --> 00:29:01.315
I'll tell you my story.

860
00:29:01.315 --> 00:29:03.345
I used to terrified to speak in public.

861
00:29:03.345 --> 00:29:04.845
Terrified. Phobic.

862
00:29:04.845 --> 00:29:06.767
I would get cement in my mouth.

863
00:29:06.767 --> 00:29:07.367
And look--

864
00:29:07.367 --> 00:29:08.287
I do it now.

865
00:29:08.287 --> 00:29:09.687
But I also thought back further,

866
00:29:09.687 --> 00:29:11.927
when I was born, I was born tongue-tied.

867
00:29:11.927 --> 00:29:13.547
Well, my tongue was actually attached

868
00:29:13.547 --> 00:29:15.007
so I wouldn't be able to talk.

869
00:29:15.007 --> 00:29:17.247
And it got cut free and you know, at birth.

870
00:29:17.247 --> 00:29:20.667
Well, I came to cut tongues free.

871
00:29:20.667 --> 00:29:21.947
Each person has--

872
00:29:21.947 --> 00:29:22.567
whatever their--

873
00:29:22.567 --> 00:29:24.259
If we can find our weakness,

874
00:29:24.259 --> 00:29:26.619
it's waiting to turn into our strength,

875
00:29:26.619 --> 00:29:28.299
It's getting us stronger

876
00:29:28.299 --> 00:29:30.379
to become magnificent about us.

877
00:29:30.379 --> 00:29:31.619
Somebody's been terrified in their life.

878
00:29:31.619 --> 00:29:32.399
When they get over it,

879
00:29:32.399 --> 00:29:34.779
their love, their confidence, their compassion,

880
00:29:34.779 --> 00:29:37.351
and their courage, is--

881
00:29:37.351 --> 00:29:38.093
we get it.

882
00:29:38.093 --> 00:29:39.493
Just by being in their presence.

883
00:29:39.493 --> 00:29:41.019
So you know, the more we understand

884
00:29:41.019 --> 00:29:44.079
energy is just here, waiting for us to bring it love,

885
00:29:44.079 --> 00:29:45.699
and turn it into a miracle.

886
00:29:45.699 --> 00:29:46.439
Now that's--

887
00:29:46.439 --> 00:29:47.279
<v Woman>Heal it.</v>

888
00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:48.339
<v ->Yes.</v>

889
00:29:48.339 --> 00:29:49.241
<v Woman>My weakness would be</v>

890
00:29:49.241 --> 00:29:51.531
my endocrine system, in this lifetime.

891
00:29:51.531 --> 00:29:52.203
<v ->Which is feelings.</v>

892
00:29:52.203 --> 00:29:53.623
<v Woman>Which is feelings.</v>

893
00:29:53.623 --> 00:29:56.383
And you talk about this at length, don't you?

894
00:29:56.383 --> 00:29:56.943
<v ->Yes, I do.</v>

895
00:29:56.943 --> 00:29:57.763
I have a whole--

896
00:29:57.763 --> 00:29:59.805
<v Woman>So how does our endocrine system--</v>

897
00:29:59.805 --> 00:30:01.965
I was reading about this in one of your articles.

898
00:30:01.965 --> 00:30:05.665
How does that feed into the process of being here now?

899
00:30:05.665 --> 00:30:07.545
<v ->Well, even when we speak about imagination,</v>

900
00:30:07.545 --> 00:30:09.725
what I find is, our entire endocrine system

901
00:30:09.725 --> 00:30:12.147
gets to be working, to imagine really,

902
00:30:12.147 --> 00:30:13.207
to functionally imagine.

903
00:30:13.207 --> 00:30:14.287
So much of my work is,

904
00:30:14.287 --> 00:30:16.167
how do we get our endocrine system working?

905
00:30:16.167 --> 00:30:18.127
Pineal is enthusiasm.

906
00:30:18.127 --> 00:30:19.401
Pituitary is pain.

907
00:30:19.401 --> 00:30:22.441
Thyroid and parathyroid is anger.

908
00:30:22.441 --> 00:30:25.851
Thymus, heart is fear.

909
00:30:25.851 --> 00:30:27.563
Pancreas and adrenal is grief.

910
00:30:27.563 --> 00:30:29.463
A spleen, even though it's part of the endocrine system,

911
00:30:29.463 --> 00:30:30.363
is apathy.

912
00:30:30.363 --> 00:30:31.663
"I can't", "it's hard."

913
00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:34.183
Reproductive system is unconsciousness.

914
00:30:34.183 --> 00:30:35.303
In the downward.

915
00:30:35.303 --> 00:30:37.824
So when we go from unconsciousness, apathy, grief,

916
00:30:37.824 --> 00:30:39.503
fear, anger, pain, enthusiasm,

917
00:30:39.503 --> 00:30:42.303
we're also activating our entire endocrine system,

918
00:30:42.303 --> 00:30:44.643
our vortex system.

919
00:30:44.643 --> 00:30:46.403
And so, we as beings of light

920
00:30:46.403 --> 00:30:48.523
with different frequencies in our body,

921
00:30:48.523 --> 00:30:50.803
get to move from the creative power through

922
00:30:50.803 --> 00:30:51.885
into "I can",

923
00:30:51.885 --> 00:30:55.145
into joy and specificity,

924
00:30:55.145 --> 00:30:57.785
into courage, which fear is into courage,

925
00:30:57.785 --> 00:31:01.445
and into forgiveness and authority and loving action,

926
00:31:01.445 --> 00:31:05.505
into intuition, pain turns into intuition,

927
00:31:05.505 --> 00:31:07.145
and then entheos, enthusiasm,

928
00:31:07.145 --> 00:31:08.689
(mumbles), pineal.

929
00:31:08.689 --> 00:31:11.549
So there's this whole frequency in our body,

930
00:31:11.549 --> 00:31:12.609
a divine electronics,

931
00:31:12.609 --> 00:31:14.549
which we can find where we are

932
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:16.869
and then go back to that replacement process.

933
00:31:16.869 --> 00:31:18.689
If we have thymus as an issue,

934
00:31:18.689 --> 00:31:20.649
or heart stuff as an issue,

935
00:31:20.649 --> 00:31:22.929
we know love and courage are

936
00:31:22.929 --> 00:31:25.969
being asked of our great spirit within us.

937
00:31:25.969 --> 00:31:28.349
So it's an amazing blueprint we can follow

938
00:31:28.349 --> 00:31:30.249
and track and have guidelines

939
00:31:30.249 --> 00:31:31.989
to move upscale into.

940
00:31:31.989 --> 00:31:33.689
<v Woman>Even the eyes are a blueprint, you say.</v>

941
00:31:33.689 --> 00:31:35.169
<v ->Well, and that shows our whole being.</v>

942
00:31:35.169 --> 00:31:36.929
So again, I do this thing,

943
00:31:36.929 --> 00:31:40.469
it's a form of iridology, sclerology and pupil tonus,

944
00:31:40.469 --> 00:31:42.749
which I call Bio-Optic Holography,

945
00:31:42.749 --> 00:31:44.389
my version of those things.

946
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:46.630
And when I read somebody's eyes, I read--

947
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:48.009
translate their body into thought, word,

948
00:31:48.009 --> 00:31:49.529
emotional patterns,

949
00:31:49.529 --> 00:31:50.949
engage them so they understand it.

950
00:31:50.949 --> 00:31:53.009
"Oh, yes, I felt this way, yes, oh yes."

951
00:31:53.009 --> 00:31:55.869
And then stay with them as they begin to find

952
00:31:55.869 --> 00:31:57.794
their strength returning.

953
00:31:57.794 --> 00:32:01.093
Literally their mission in life can be revealed

954
00:32:01.093 --> 00:32:01.735
through our eyes.

955
00:32:01.735 --> 00:32:02.955
I believe we all know that anyway.

956
00:32:02.955 --> 00:32:04.015
I mean, when we make eye contact,

957
00:32:04.015 --> 00:32:06.455
we know everything there is to know about each other.

958
00:32:06.455 --> 00:32:09.376
So, might as well get onto this thing so--

959
00:32:09.376 --> 00:32:11.155
<v Woman>You have an incredible power</v>

960
00:32:11.155 --> 00:32:12.575
of observation that you've developed

961
00:32:12.575 --> 00:32:14.133
because you're looking at body language,

962
00:32:14.133 --> 00:32:17.173
you're listening to every word a person says,

963
00:32:17.173 --> 00:32:19.593
you can intuit from their endocrine system,

964
00:32:19.593 --> 00:32:20.793
you're looking in their eyes,

965
00:32:20.793 --> 00:32:22.733
so you're saying who we are

966
00:32:22.733 --> 00:32:24.553
is written in every aspect of our being

967
00:32:24.553 --> 00:32:25.183
<v ->Yep.</v>

968
00:32:25.183 --> 00:32:26.728
<v Woman>and we're not that hard to read.</v>

969
00:32:26.728 --> 00:32:27.288
<v ->No.</v>

970
00:32:27.288 --> 00:32:28.368
<v Woman>If you know how to do it.</v>

971
00:32:28.368 --> 00:32:29.372
<v ->Yeah, so most of us get it anyway,</v>

972
00:32:29.372 --> 00:32:31.012
it's just like, nice to know what's up.

973
00:32:31.012 --> 00:32:32.612
I mean, whether it's our ear, our fingertips,

974
00:32:32.612 --> 00:32:36.812
or the microcosm and the macrocosm are connected,

975
00:32:36.812 --> 00:32:38.672
mirroring each other.

976
00:32:38.672 --> 00:32:42.012
<v Woman>Would you mind giving us a success story?</v>

977
00:32:42.012 --> 00:32:44.132
Something that really touched your heart,

978
00:32:44.132 --> 00:32:45.912
in terms of somebody that you've worked with,

979
00:32:45.912 --> 00:32:48.012
which was somebody who may have been

980
00:32:48.012 --> 00:32:50.672
in a desperate state and what they were able to do

981
00:32:50.672 --> 00:32:53.392
by being vigilant with this process.

982
00:32:53.392 --> 00:32:54.394
<v ->Oh, I have lots and lots and lots.</v>

983
00:32:54.394 --> 00:32:55.838
<v Woman>Yes, just pick one or two,</v>

984
00:32:55.838 --> 00:32:56.958
<v Woman>most people love hearing--</v>
<v ->Sure.</v>

985
00:32:56.958 --> 00:32:57.748
<v Woman>I love hearing these stories.</v>

986
00:32:57.748 --> 00:32:59.304
<v ->Just yesterday, we had,</v>

987
00:32:59.304 --> 00:33:01.708
in fact, this is gonna be part of our DVD set

988
00:33:01.708 --> 00:33:03.488
on Sacred Body Language Translation.

989
00:33:03.488 --> 00:33:05.608
A young man stood up to demonstrate,

990
00:33:05.608 --> 00:33:07.628
you know, and find out what his body was saying,

991
00:33:07.628 --> 00:33:09.848
and he had an issue with not feeling confident

992
00:33:09.848 --> 00:33:11.208
and approval from his brother.

993
00:33:11.208 --> 00:33:12.528
Major, major deal in his life.

994
00:33:12.528 --> 00:33:13.688
15 years young.

995
00:33:13.688 --> 00:33:14.768
Beautiful soul.

996
00:33:14.768 --> 00:33:17.708
And by just staying with him until he made a choice

997
00:33:17.708 --> 00:33:18.508
and then he--

998
00:33:18.508 --> 00:33:20.888
his brother had been challenged

999
00:33:20.888 --> 00:33:22.568
with alcohol and drugs and--

1000
00:33:22.568 --> 00:33:24.248
older brother, and hadn't been home,

1001
00:33:24.248 --> 00:33:26.588
and hadn't seen him and yet he's waiting for approval

1002
00:33:26.588 --> 00:33:28.642
from his brother and realized, you know,

1003
00:33:28.642 --> 00:33:30.462
it comes from within and then he realized,

1004
00:33:30.462 --> 00:33:32.262
I can heal my brother with my love,

1005
00:33:32.262 --> 00:33:34.522
and I heal my brother with my love.

1006
00:33:34.522 --> 00:33:37.422
Whew, it's emotional.

1007
00:33:37.422 --> 00:33:40.874
Next day, next morning, his brother shows up.

1008
00:33:40.874 --> 00:33:42.694
"I'm ready to get healed."

1009
00:33:42.694 --> 00:33:46.914
Now that 15 year old boy found his heart,

1010
00:33:46.914 --> 00:33:49.054
spoke it in conscious language,

1011
00:33:49.054 --> 00:33:53.874
and had his brother miraculously ask for help.

1012
00:33:53.874 --> 00:33:55.928
I worked with him the next day after that.

1013
00:33:55.928 --> 00:33:56.888
Miracles happen.

1014
00:33:56.888 --> 00:33:59.348
We're just miracles waiting to happen,

1015
00:33:59.348 --> 00:34:00.628
Moment to moment to moment.

1016
00:34:00.628 --> 00:34:03.768
And so, instead of focusing on what's wrong,

1017
00:34:03.768 --> 00:34:05.388
or what he doesn't have, this young man,

1018
00:34:05.388 --> 00:34:07.028
he claimed what he chose,

1019
00:34:07.028 --> 00:34:09.068
I'm healing my brother with my love.

1020
00:34:09.068 --> 00:34:10.098
And he had it (finger snap) within,

1021
00:34:10.098 --> 00:34:11.180
usually it's within 24 hours.

1022
00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.820
I mean, who knows, whatever time.

1023
00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:15.840
And yet, we can do anything.

1024
00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.840
I just, as a coach, get to be willing

1025
00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.680
to feel right along with him.

1026
00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:20.520
Because it's powerful.

1027
00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.400
<v Woman>Yes, it is powerful.</v>

1028
00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:27.140
And a 15 year old person, on one level,

1029
00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:28.822
has experienced so little in life,

1030
00:34:28.822 --> 00:34:31.542
you might say, it's even easier to absorb

1031
00:34:31.542 --> 00:34:33.422
some of these new ideas and thoughts.

1032
00:34:33.422 --> 00:34:35.942
What about a success story from someone

1033
00:34:35.942 --> 00:34:40.302
who has been in the trenches for a long time.

1034
00:34:40.302 --> 00:34:42.242
<v ->In my experience,</v>

1035
00:34:42.242 --> 00:34:44.194
everybody I work with has a success story.

1036
00:34:44.194 --> 00:34:46.256
I mean, so, when I take somebody--

1037
00:34:46.256 --> 00:34:47.236
I'll give you one example.

1038
00:34:47.236 --> 00:34:51.096
There's a woman who was 65, as I remember.

1039
00:34:51.096 --> 00:34:53.776
She was taking one of my conscious language courses,

1040
00:34:53.776 --> 00:34:56.036
and she stood up and didn't what she was saying.

1041
00:34:56.036 --> 00:34:57.036
She said, "I know I want--

1042
00:34:57.036 --> 00:34:59.336
"I've been wanting my husband for 40 years--"

1043
00:34:59.336 --> 00:35:02.096
to do something, whatever it was, I chose to remember,

1044
00:35:02.096 --> 00:35:04.996
and you know, I just played back, "wanting him"?

1045
00:35:04.996 --> 00:35:08.274
And she goes, "Oh! I have been wanting him."

1046
00:35:08.274 --> 00:35:09.154
So she just said, "Well--"

1047
00:35:09.154 --> 00:35:09.974
And she just made--

1048
00:35:09.974 --> 00:35:11.114
"I am empowering him--"

1049
00:35:11.114 --> 00:35:13.454
Whatever, she made new choice.

1050
00:35:13.454 --> 00:35:14.714
That was the third day of the class,

1051
00:35:14.714 --> 00:35:15.774
it was a four-day class.

1052
00:35:15.774 --> 00:35:18.614
She came in the next morning, a new woman.

1053
00:35:18.614 --> 00:35:21.096
And she got up there, same kind of emotion I'm expressing,

1054
00:35:21.096 --> 00:35:26.096
and said, "He had already done, by the time I got home,

1055
00:35:26.456 --> 00:35:29.376
"what I'd been wanting him to do for 40 years."

1056
00:35:29.376 --> 00:35:33.256
She changed her consciousness of her partner.

1057
00:35:33.256 --> 00:35:34.056
<v Woman>So how would you have</v>

1058
00:35:34.056 --> 00:35:34.930
changed that language?

1059
00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:37.110
<v ->She just went from "I want" to "I see him doing it"</v>

1060
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:39.050
or "I claim he does it" or "I--"

1061
00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:40.432
Whatever, she made a shift in language

1062
00:35:40.432 --> 00:35:41.892
and I'll give you another real simple one.

1063
00:35:41.892 --> 00:35:43.972
A woman I know, a professional, had

1064
00:35:43.972 --> 00:35:46.192
at that point, a three year old child,

1065
00:35:46.192 --> 00:35:48.452
she was making revenue for their family.

1066
00:35:48.452 --> 00:35:50.392
Her husband who was in real estate was making,

1067
00:35:50.392 --> 00:35:53.712
you know, like $10,000 a year,

1068
00:35:53.712 --> 00:35:55.032
and she was resentful.

1069
00:35:55.032 --> 00:35:56.572
She realized, "Well, I'm resenting him."

1070
00:35:56.572 --> 00:35:58.292
So she just changed her mind.

1071
00:35:58.292 --> 00:36:00.832
She imagined herself retired,

1072
00:36:00.832 --> 00:36:02.152
taking care of her daughter,

1073
00:36:02.152 --> 00:36:03.852
as a professional, a physician,

1074
00:36:03.852 --> 00:36:05.512
and she imagined--

1075
00:36:05.512 --> 00:36:06.492
she made an agreement,

1076
00:36:06.492 --> 00:36:08.732
and could feel her husband successful.

1077
00:36:08.732 --> 00:36:10.892
From that moment on, every six months,

1078
00:36:10.892 --> 00:36:13.632
he brought in a $160,000 every six months.

1079
00:36:13.632 --> 00:36:14.532
She retired.

1080
00:36:14.532 --> 00:36:16.372
And he didn't change anything.

1081
00:36:16.372 --> 00:36:18.752
She changed her agreement

1082
00:36:18.752 --> 00:36:21.312
about her life and her beloved husband.

1083
00:36:21.312 --> 00:36:23.212
And he flourished.

1084
00:36:23.212 --> 00:36:25.452
<v Woman>So how does that work in quantum field?</v>

1085
00:36:25.452 --> 00:36:28.212
You change your perceptions.

1086
00:36:28.212 --> 00:36:29.473
<v ->The perception around us.</v>

1087
00:36:29.473 --> 00:36:33.132
Yeah, our inner speech becomes our outer reality.

1088
00:36:33.132 --> 00:36:34.192
You know, as a man, as a woman,

1089
00:36:34.192 --> 00:36:36.172
thinketh, in our heart, a big deal,

1090
00:36:36.172 --> 00:36:37.392
so are we.

1091
00:36:37.392 --> 00:36:38.852
And it gets to be in our heart,

1092
00:36:38.852 --> 00:36:40.512
our own heart, our own feelings,

1093
00:36:40.512 --> 00:36:43.772
our own joy, our own thriving.

1094
00:36:43.772 --> 00:36:48.372
(soothing music)

1095
00:36:48.372 --> 00:36:49.245
<v ->Incredible work.</v>

1096
00:36:49.245 --> 00:36:51.145
Another of our speakers that is in alignment

1097
00:36:51.145 --> 00:36:53.985
with the conscious use of our words and our thoughts

1098
00:36:53.985 --> 00:36:55.745
is Dr. John Demartini.

1099
00:36:55.745 --> 00:36:57.465
I use the work of both of these men

1100
00:36:57.465 --> 00:37:00.445
to put myself by on track when I become clouded.

1101
00:37:00.445 --> 00:37:03.165
Until next time, thanks for watching.

1102
00:37:03.165 --> 00:37:07.546
(soothing music)
