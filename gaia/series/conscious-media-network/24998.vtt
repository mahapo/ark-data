00:00:00.431 --> 00:00:03.871
<v ->Stanislov Grof began his career in psychotherapy</v>

2
00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:06.951
at the end of the Nazi occupation of Czechoslavakia.

3
00:00:06.951 --> 00:00:08.911
Do not adjust your computer screen.

4
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:11.111
Yes, he looks like a much younger man.

5
00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:13.231
A testament to living his truth.

6
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:16.071
In his work, exploring altered states of consciousness,

7
00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:18.651
he came to see how ludicrous the traditional

8
00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:21.251
medical understanding of these non-ordinary

9
00:00:21.251 --> 00:00:22.971
states of consciousness were.

10
00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:26.270
For example, in today's lexicon of pathology

11
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.471
Buddha would be labeled schizophrenic

12
00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:29.510
or at least borderline

13
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.311
and St. John of the Cross a hereditary degenerative.

14
00:00:33.311 --> 00:00:35.511
His journey into expanded awareness

15
00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:37.791
began as a medical student volunteering

16
00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:40.311
for a new drug called LSD.

17
00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:42.821
(peaceful music)

18
00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:52.511
<v Voiceover>Let's start, not at the beginning,</v>

19
00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:53.810
but at your beginning,

20
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.810
which is your background was in psychoanalysis,

21
00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:02.111
Freudian psychoanalysis.

22
00:01:02.111 --> 00:01:04.091
What were you finding that was lacking

23
00:01:04.091 --> 00:01:06.930
that threw you onto this incredible path?

24
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.990
<v ->I went to medicine with the expressed goal</v>

25
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.850
to become a psychoanalyst.

26
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.920
My original plan was really to work in animated movies.

27
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.619
When I was finishing what in the states

28
00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.489
would be high school,

29
00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:27.070
I had an interview and I was supposed to start working

30
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.240
in the film studios in Prague.

31
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.370
Just at that time a friend of mine came

32
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.230
and handed me a book

33
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.360
which was Freud's Introductory Lectures

34
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.810
to Psychoanalysis.

35
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.770
I didn't know very much about Freud.

36
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.230
You have to imagine this was after the six years

37
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.210
of the Nazi occupation where everything

38
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.850
that was related to psychoanalysis was burned.

39
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.979
<v Voiceover>This was in Czechoslavakia.</v>

40
00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.460
<v ->Yeah. All these books were burned in the streets.</v>

41
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.390
Three years after the war,

42
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.910
the libraries were trying to get the books back.

43
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.489
Then the communists came and Freud was again indexed.

44
00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:09.780
You had to be a Marxist writing a critique of Freud

45
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.780
to get access to Freudian books.

46
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.550
All I knew about Freud

47
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.430
was what they told us in classes of Philosophy,

48
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.630
which was that he was a pansexualist.

49
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.690
He was trying to explain everything

50
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.680
from symbolism of dreams

51
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.990
through symptoms of neurosis

52
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.729
to religion and art from repressed sexuality.

53
00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:39.690
I was kind of marginally interested to start with

54
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.629
and I started reading the book.

55
00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.749
I got myself into this really kind of feverish state.

56
00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:49.900
I got so excited by Freud's logic,

57
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.969
I couldn't go to sleep.

58
00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.550
I read through the night and within two days

59
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.200
I decided I would let the animated movies go

60
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.677
and go to study medicine to become a psychoanalyst.

61
00:03:02.677 --> 00:03:03.618
<v Voiceover>Where did you start running</v>

62
00:03:03.618 --> 00:03:04.708
into your first roadblocks

63
00:03:04.708 --> 00:03:08.658
once you gained this knowledge and practice?

64
00:03:08.658 --> 00:03:12.778
Once you got through school and you started practicing,

65
00:03:12.778 --> 00:03:14.228
where did you start seeing your first limitations

66
00:03:14.228 --> 00:03:15.348
or roadblocks?

67
00:03:15.348 --> 00:03:18.938
<v ->The problem initially for me was the conflict</v>

68
00:03:18.938 --> 00:03:22.118
between the theory of psychoanalysis

69
00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:23.998
which seemed to explain everything.

70
00:03:23.998 --> 00:03:25.728
My analyst used to say,

71
00:03:25.728 --> 00:03:27.618
"There's nothing in the psyche

72
00:03:27.618 --> 00:03:29.558
"that psychoanalysis cannot explain.

73
00:03:29.558 --> 00:03:32.328
"There are only things that it has not explained yet,

74
00:03:32.328 --> 00:03:35.058
"because there were not the right persons

75
00:03:35.058 --> 00:03:37.978
"giving the free associations."

76
00:03:37.978 --> 00:03:40.818
I had difficulties understanding how a system

77
00:03:40.818 --> 00:03:43.698
that seems to be able to explain everything

78
00:03:43.698 --> 00:03:48.438
cannot offer more effective therapeutic techniques.

79
00:03:48.438 --> 00:03:51.838
I realized there were very narrow

80
00:03:51.838 --> 00:03:55.358
sort of criteria for indications.

81
00:03:55.358 --> 00:03:57.218
You had to meet very special criteria

82
00:03:57.218 --> 00:04:00.678
to be considered a good candidate.

83
00:04:00.678 --> 00:04:03.198
Even if you were considered a good candidate,

84
00:04:03.198 --> 00:04:06.758
you had to commit yourself an enormous amount of time.

85
00:04:06.758 --> 00:04:10.098
My analysis was three times a week, seven years.

86
00:04:10.098 --> 00:04:12.598
<v Voiceover>Has to be a faster way.</v>

87
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.870
<v ->I had great difficulties because I had to study medicine</v>

88
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.570
to become a Freudian analyst.

89
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.160
You have to have a medical background in Europe.

90
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.030
If you study medicine,

91
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.510
you find out that if you really understand a problem

92
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.290
then you should be able to do something

93
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.770
pretty dramatic about it or if you cannot

94
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.969
you can understand your failures.

95
00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:39.750
Like with cancer or with AIDS,

96
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.590
we have a pretty good idea as to where the problem is,

97
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.370
what we have to change for us.

98
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.710
You know, why we are ineffective.

99
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.569
Whereas here suddenly there was like a full understanding

100
00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.630
of a problem and you can do so little

101
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.150
over such a long period of time.

102
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.110
It just didn't make any sense to me.

103
00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.140
<v Voiceover>Hopscotching forward just a little bit,</v>

104
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.330
and not that much forward.

105
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.838
Enter the subject of

106
00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:08.558
backing into in essence psychedelic drugs

107
00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:12.898
and using this for clinical research among medical faculty.

108
00:05:12.898 --> 00:05:15.138
Can you explain how psychedelic drugs

109
00:05:15.138 --> 00:05:18.538
entered this whole arena in your life?

110
00:05:18.538 --> 00:05:21.557
<v ->To me, this was initially completely unrelated</v>

111
00:05:21.557 --> 00:05:24.148
to my interest in psychoanalysis.

112
00:05:24.148 --> 00:05:27.068
I was working at the

113
00:05:27.068 --> 00:05:29.938
Psychiatry Department of the School of Medicine

114
00:05:29.938 --> 00:05:31.378
in Prague.

115
00:05:31.378 --> 00:05:33.918
We were just finishing a large study of Mellaril,

116
00:05:33.918 --> 00:05:35.458
one of the early tranquilizers.

117
00:05:35.458 --> 00:05:39.418
That came from Saunders Pharmaceutical Companies.

118
00:05:39.418 --> 00:05:42.798
They were sending us samples of various substances

119
00:05:42.798 --> 00:05:44.378
that they produced.

120
00:05:44.378 --> 00:05:47.118
As part of this, they sent us a sample,

121
00:05:47.118 --> 00:05:49.068
big sample of LSD,

122
00:05:49.068 --> 00:05:51.737
asking us would we like to work with it

123
00:05:51.737 --> 00:05:56.198
and let them know if there was any legitimate use for it.

124
00:05:56.198 --> 00:05:59.417
They suggested in their letter two uses.

125
00:05:59.417 --> 00:06:01.998
One was maybe this substance could be used

126
00:06:01.998 --> 00:06:04.718
as a model psychosis.

127
00:06:04.718 --> 00:06:06.658
There seemed to be some similarities

128
00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:10.217
between the experiences of people on LSD

129
00:06:10.217 --> 00:06:15.217
and the symptoms of naturally occurring psychosis.

130
00:06:15.477 --> 00:06:16.957
This would be a model.

131
00:06:16.957 --> 00:06:19.378
You could give it to so-called normal people,

132
00:06:19.378 --> 00:06:22.238
do all kinds of testing before, during and after,

133
00:06:22.238 --> 00:06:24.957
and get some insight as to what's happening

134
00:06:24.957 --> 00:06:28.837
biologically, biochemically, physiologically

135
00:06:28.837 --> 00:06:32.798
in the body of people at the time when they have these

136
00:06:32.798 --> 00:06:35.298
very unusual experiences.

137
00:06:35.298 --> 00:06:36.818
<v Voiceover>This was their idea</v>

138
00:06:36.818 --> 00:06:38.448
how it might be properly utilized.

139
00:06:38.448 --> 00:06:39.102
<v ->Yes.</v>

140
00:06:39.102 --> 00:06:41.213
<v Voiceover>What actually ended up happening with it</v>

141
00:06:41.213 --> 00:06:43.403
and how did this affect your life?

142
00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:48.073
<v ->There was a second little note which was there</v>

143
00:06:48.073 --> 00:06:52.793
which really became a critical element in my life.

144
00:06:52.793 --> 00:06:54.923
Where they said maybe this could be used

145
00:06:54.923 --> 00:06:58.493
as a kind of unconventional training tool.

146
00:06:58.493 --> 00:07:01.312
Psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, students

147
00:07:01.312 --> 00:07:04.853
could spend a few hours in the world of their patients.

148
00:07:04.853 --> 00:07:05.973
<v Voiceover>In other words,</v>

149
00:07:05.973 --> 00:07:06.942
if the practitioners ...

150
00:07:06.942 --> 00:07:08.063
<v ->For learning purposes.</v>

151
00:07:08.063 --> 00:07:08.738
<v Voiceover>In the medical community</v>

152
00:07:08.738 --> 00:07:11.257
took the LSD and started experiencing it,

153
00:07:11.257 --> 00:07:12.257
they would be able to relate

154
00:07:12.257 --> 00:07:13.478
to their patients better, right?

155
00:07:13.478 --> 00:07:15.238
<v ->Yes. Understand them better.</v>

156
00:07:15.238 --> 00:07:17.607
Be able to treat them more effectively.

157
00:07:17.607 --> 00:07:18.787
<v Voiceover>Did you end up being</v>

158
00:07:18.787 --> 00:07:19.988
one of the people that ...

159
00:07:19.988 --> 00:07:22.298
<v ->Yes. I became one of the early volunteers</v>

160
00:07:22.298 --> 00:07:25.067
and I had an experience that changed my life,

161
00:07:25.067 --> 00:07:28.477
professionally as well as personally.

162
00:07:28.477 --> 00:07:30.117
<v Voiceover>What happened?</v>

163
00:07:31.667 --> 00:07:35.107
<v ->This was an actual situation where I had to agree,</v>

164
00:07:35.107 --> 00:07:38.967
besides doing the LSD, to have the EEG taken

165
00:07:38.967 --> 00:07:40.507
before, during and after,

166
00:07:40.507 --> 00:07:43.487
and also do something that was called

167
00:07:43.487 --> 00:07:45.897
driving the brainwaves.

168
00:07:45.897 --> 00:07:47.587
Which was basically, in my case,

169
00:07:47.587 --> 00:07:52.377
exposure to powerful stroboscopic light.

170
00:07:52.377 --> 00:07:55.087
When the light came on at the time

171
00:07:55.087 --> 00:08:00.087
and I was peaking on LSD,

172
00:08:00.967 --> 00:08:04.617
I saw this light of incredible intensity.

173
00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:07.327
I lost the connection with my body.

174
00:08:07.327 --> 00:08:10.007
I lost the connection with Prague,

175
00:08:10.007 --> 00:08:12.297
with the planet.

176
00:08:12.297 --> 00:08:14.307
I had a sense that my consciousness

177
00:08:14.307 --> 00:08:16.607
just became all there was.

178
00:08:16.607 --> 00:08:20.207
Powerful, powerful cosmic mystical experience.

179
00:08:20.207 --> 00:08:22.517
I came down from that experience

180
00:08:22.517 --> 00:08:24.157
with a sense that

181
00:08:24.157 --> 00:08:26.007
that's by far the most interesting thing

182
00:08:26.007 --> 00:08:28.547
that you can do when you're a psychiatrist.

183
00:08:28.547 --> 00:08:31.947
For about 50 years since that time,

184
00:08:31.947 --> 00:08:34.927
I have really professionally done very little,

185
00:08:34.927 --> 00:08:37.027
except things that in one way or another

186
00:08:37.027 --> 00:08:39.217
were related to these states.

187
00:08:39.217 --> 00:08:41.197
Became my passion.

188
00:08:41.197 --> 00:08:45.287
<v Voiceover>In that 50 years,</v>

189
00:08:45.287 --> 00:08:47.427
your discovery ...

190
00:08:47.427 --> 00:08:49.867
Can you explain what your discovery has been

191
00:08:49.867 --> 00:08:52.547
in terms of the understanding of

192
00:08:52.547 --> 00:08:54.507
and also the value of

193
00:08:54.507 --> 00:08:57.007
having had these mystical experiences.

194
00:08:57.007 --> 00:09:00.727
Whether they're induced by a psychedelic drug

195
00:09:00.727 --> 00:09:03.407
or whether they're induced by a shamanistic practice

196
00:09:03.407 --> 00:09:04.697
or meditation.

197
00:09:04.697 --> 00:09:06.847
What is this that we're now bumping up against

198
00:09:06.847 --> 00:09:09.737
at this point in our human evolution?

199
00:09:09.737 --> 00:09:13.847
<v ->We have, in traditional psychiatry, psychology,</v>

200
00:09:13.847 --> 00:09:18.457
we have the idea that these experiences are

201
00:09:18.457 --> 00:09:20.767
what's called altered states of consciousness.

202
00:09:20.767 --> 00:09:23.237
Which means inauthentic,

203
00:09:23.237 --> 00:09:25.887
sort of distorted

204
00:09:25.887 --> 00:09:28.507
due to some kind of toxic influences.

205
00:09:28.507 --> 00:09:31.668
These are experiences produced by the brain

206
00:09:31.668 --> 00:09:34.647
under certain abnormal circumstances,

207
00:09:34.647 --> 00:09:37.207
and they have no relevance.

208
00:09:37.207 --> 00:09:38.137
They are not healing.

209
00:09:38.137 --> 00:09:39.167
They are not transformative.

210
00:09:39.167 --> 00:09:40.407
They are not evolutionary.

211
00:09:40.407 --> 00:09:41.767
<v Voiceover>They're just abnormalities.</v>

212
00:09:41.767 --> 00:09:42.547
<v ->Abnormalities.</v>

213
00:09:42.547 --> 00:09:44.687
<v Voiceover>Maybe you're even labeled psychotic</v>

214
00:09:44.687 --> 00:09:45.897
if you have these and speak of them.

215
00:09:45.897 --> 00:09:46.462
<v ->Yeah, definitely.</v>

216
00:09:46.462 --> 00:09:50.003
<v ->Any non-ordinary state with the exception of a dream,</v>

217
00:09:50.003 --> 00:09:51.344
a dream which is not,

218
00:09:51.344 --> 00:09:52.404
I would have to say,

219
00:09:52.404 --> 00:09:55.803
which is not associated with anxiety

220
00:09:55.803 --> 00:09:58.083
and it doesn't repeat too frequently.

221
00:09:58.083 --> 00:10:01.243
Because then, even dream is seen as pathological.

222
00:10:01.243 --> 00:10:03.933
But you can have the ordinary variety

223
00:10:03.933 --> 00:10:06.133
without getting a diagnosis.

224
00:10:06.133 --> 00:10:09.323
But any other non-ordinary state of consciousness

225
00:10:09.323 --> 00:10:11.323
would be seen as pathological.

226
00:10:11.323 --> 00:10:12.783
<v Voiceover>It's a diagnosis then.</v>

227
00:10:12.783 --> 00:10:14.363
<v ->There is no distinction between</v>

228
00:10:14.363 --> 00:10:15.963
a mystical or spiritual experience

229
00:10:15.963 --> 00:10:17.203
on the one hand,

230
00:10:17.203 --> 00:10:19.164
and a psychotic experience.

231
00:10:19.164 --> 00:10:22.403
Meaning symptom of mental disease,

232
00:10:22.403 --> 00:10:23.863
serious mental disease.

233
00:10:23.863 --> 00:10:25.003
<v Voiceover>After your experience,</v>

234
00:10:25.003 --> 00:10:26.743
this must have caused you some trouble

235
00:10:26.743 --> 00:10:30.743
to realize that that is the commonly held

236
00:10:30.743 --> 00:10:33.503
notion about all experiences.

237
00:10:33.503 --> 00:10:34.583
They're all in the same basket.

238
00:10:34.583 --> 00:10:35.414
<v ->Yes. There was no ...</v>

239
00:10:35.414 --> 00:10:36.946
<v Voiceover>Being a nutcase, so to speak.</v>

240
00:10:36.946 --> 00:10:38.626
<v ->Yeah. Working with these experiences</v>

241
00:10:38.626 --> 00:10:40.387
for a number of years,

242
00:10:40.387 --> 00:10:43.547
it became absolutely obvious to me that these are,

243
00:10:43.547 --> 00:10:46.786
if anything those are super normal experiences

244
00:10:46.786 --> 00:10:48.947
that are not altered states.

245
00:10:48.947 --> 00:10:50.627
They are not distortions

246
00:10:50.627 --> 00:10:52.626
of what the world is like

247
00:10:52.626 --> 00:10:54.047
or what we are like,

248
00:10:54.047 --> 00:10:56.147
but that they kind of show certain

249
00:10:56.147 --> 00:10:59.766
additional dimensions of us

250
00:10:59.766 --> 00:11:01.866
as human beings

251
00:11:01.866 --> 00:11:04.246
and additional dimensions of reality

252
00:11:04.246 --> 00:11:06.586
which are not available

253
00:11:06.586 --> 00:11:08.347
in the ordinary state of consciousness.

254
00:11:08.347 --> 00:11:10.386
They are complimentary.

255
00:11:10.386 --> 00:11:12.566
Mystics, when they have a mystical experience,

256
00:11:12.566 --> 00:11:14.226
they don't have the sense

257
00:11:14.226 --> 00:11:16.026
that they experienced some kind of a distortion

258
00:11:16.026 --> 00:11:17.707
of how things are.

259
00:11:17.707 --> 00:11:18.766
On the contrary,

260
00:11:18.766 --> 00:11:23.306
they experience a sense that now they really

261
00:11:23.306 --> 00:11:25.147
have some profound understanding

262
00:11:25.147 --> 00:11:27.026
of what existence is about.

263
00:11:27.026 --> 00:11:28.807
They get a piece which they were missing

264
00:11:28.807 --> 00:11:29.966
up to that point.

265
00:11:29.966 --> 00:11:33.047
The every day and the non-ordinary

266
00:11:33.047 --> 00:11:34.567
of what I call holotropic,

267
00:11:34.567 --> 00:11:37.247
which is a certain important subcategory

268
00:11:37.247 --> 00:11:38.986
of non-ordinary experiences,

269
00:11:38.986 --> 00:11:41.427
those are complimentary.

270
00:11:41.427 --> 00:11:43.106
Each of them gives you a perspective

271
00:11:43.106 --> 00:11:45.517
on a different sector

272
00:11:45.517 --> 00:11:49.336
or aspect of reality.

273
00:11:49.336 --> 00:11:51.766
<v Voiceover>Very simply,</v>

274
00:11:51.766 --> 00:11:53.087
in your mind now,

275
00:11:53.087 --> 00:11:55.267
before we go to ways of being able to help

276
00:11:55.267 --> 00:11:59.716
facilitate these other states of consciousness.

277
00:11:59.716 --> 00:12:02.256
Talk therapy.

278
00:12:02.256 --> 00:12:03.610
What's it good for really?

279
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:04.475
When you get down to it,

280
00:12:04.475 --> 00:12:05.845
what's talk therapy do?

281
00:12:05.845 --> 00:12:06.387
<v ->Talk therapy,</v>

282
00:12:06.387 --> 00:12:07.647
the way I see it now,

283
00:12:07.647 --> 00:12:10.067
is still good, for example,

284
00:12:10.067 --> 00:12:11.927
when you work with couples

285
00:12:11.927 --> 00:12:14.696
and you need somebody who's a little more objective,

286
00:12:14.696 --> 00:12:19.167
who sort of gives each of those partners feedback

287
00:12:19.167 --> 00:12:23.947
as to the different loops that people get caught in

288
00:12:23.947 --> 00:12:25.727
or family therapy

289
00:12:25.727 --> 00:12:28.320
where you're dealing with the whole system.

290
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.869
<v Voiceover>Almost like a mediator in part.</v>

291
00:12:30.869 --> 00:12:31.875
<v ->Even in that case,</v>

292
00:12:31.875 --> 00:12:35.676
I would today use some kind of deep experiential work

293
00:12:35.676 --> 00:12:37.356
individually with the partners.

294
00:12:37.356 --> 00:12:40.116
Then you can use verbal therapy

295
00:12:40.116 --> 00:12:42.135
when you're working specifically

296
00:12:42.135 --> 00:12:46.246
on the distortion of the interaction between them.

297
00:12:46.246 --> 00:12:49.345
The idea

298
00:12:49.345 --> 00:12:51.771
of working through,

299
00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.691
let's say some serious problems,

300
00:12:53.691 --> 00:12:57.991
like the idea that you could work through asthma,

301
00:12:57.991 --> 00:13:01.651
just talking about it is just not very realistic.

302
00:13:01.651 --> 00:13:03.192
<v Voiceover>Let's use asthma then.</v>

303
00:13:03.192 --> 00:13:05.991
As an example of how,

304
00:13:05.991 --> 00:13:07.811
in your mind now through your experience

305
00:13:07.811 --> 00:13:08.831
and what you've developed,

306
00:13:08.831 --> 00:13:09.752
how would you work through

307
00:13:09.752 --> 00:13:10.591
something like asthma.

308
00:13:10.591 --> 00:13:11.594
How many layers

309
00:13:11.594 --> 00:13:14.714
might be underneath that condition?

310
00:13:14.714 --> 00:13:16.434
<v ->What we do.</v>

311
00:13:16.434 --> 00:13:18.014
We cannot use psychedelics now.

312
00:13:18.014 --> 00:13:20.074
I don't have the legal framework,

313
00:13:20.074 --> 00:13:22.754
but we work with holotropic breath work.

314
00:13:22.754 --> 00:13:26.184
<v Voiceover>Tell me a little bit about the breath.</v>

315
00:13:26.184 --> 00:13:28.554
<v ->You work basically in such a way</v>

316
00:13:28.554 --> 00:13:31.154
that you are in a reclining position

317
00:13:31.154 --> 00:13:32.934
on a mattress with

318
00:13:32.934 --> 00:13:35.854
eye shades or with your eyes closed.

319
00:13:35.854 --> 00:13:38.454
There is a sudden kind of introduction

320
00:13:38.454 --> 00:13:40.595
which involves relaxation of the body,

321
00:13:40.595 --> 00:13:42.934
bringing yourself into the present moment.

322
00:13:42.934 --> 00:13:44.015
Then at a certain point,

323
00:13:44.015 --> 00:13:46.074
you start breathing a little faster,

324
00:13:46.074 --> 00:13:47.514
deeper than usual,

325
00:13:47.514 --> 00:13:49.874
tying the inhalation and the exhalation

326
00:13:49.874 --> 00:13:52.274
into a kind of circle of breath.

327
00:13:52.274 --> 00:13:56.294
Then we start playing powerful music,

328
00:13:56.294 --> 00:13:59.054
usually music that's drawn from

329
00:13:59.054 --> 00:14:01.594
some of the ethnic traditions.

330
00:14:01.594 --> 00:14:03.874
From cultures that

331
00:14:03.874 --> 00:14:06.574
are using music to change consciousness.

332
00:14:06.574 --> 00:14:08.834
<v Voiceover>Kind of training the brain?</v>

333
00:14:08.834 --> 00:14:11.134
<v ->Yeah. Let's say the different</v>

334
00:14:11.134 --> 00:14:12.594
African cultures

335
00:14:12.594 --> 00:14:14.654
or some other non-Western cultures

336
00:14:14.654 --> 00:14:16.434
developed drumming rhythms

337
00:14:16.434 --> 00:14:20.134
that can very powerfully change the brain functioning

338
00:14:20.134 --> 00:14:22.334
and use a trans state.

339
00:14:22.334 --> 00:14:26.034
Or we play Tibetan ritual music

340
00:14:26.034 --> 00:14:28.874
or Sufi music,

341
00:14:28.874 --> 00:14:31.574
also some good contemporary music,

342
00:14:31.574 --> 00:14:34.254
particularly one that's inspired by

343
00:14:34.254 --> 00:14:36.394
these spiritual or ethnic

344
00:14:36.394 --> 00:14:38.884
traditions.

345
00:14:38.884 --> 00:14:39.964
<v Voiceover>Before you continue this,</v>

346
00:14:39.964 --> 00:14:41.884
just to interject something.

347
00:14:41.884 --> 00:14:43.673
The breath has always been

348
00:14:43.673 --> 00:14:45.949
considered a pathway into enlightenment

349
00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:48.729
in many ancient cultures hasn't it?

350
00:14:48.729 --> 00:14:50.749
<v ->In many ancient cultures,</v>

351
00:14:50.749 --> 00:14:54.809
you see breath somehow touches on many different levels.

352
00:14:54.809 --> 00:14:56.070
It's the physical level.

353
00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.289
It's the air that you breathe.

354
00:14:58.289 --> 00:15:00.969
A very important physiological function.

355
00:15:00.969 --> 00:15:03.289
You couldn't live without breathing.

356
00:15:03.289 --> 00:15:06.989
But it's also connecting then you with the psyche

357
00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:10.409
and through the psyche to the spirit.

358
00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:12.849
In many, many cultures

359
00:15:12.849 --> 00:15:16.130
linguistically, there is a deep connection

360
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.809
between breath and spirit.

361
00:15:18.809 --> 00:15:20.749
Like if you have terms like

362
00:15:20.749 --> 00:15:23.289
Pluma, in the Gnostic tradition,

363
00:15:23.289 --> 00:15:24.369
means breath

364
00:15:24.369 --> 00:15:26.219
but also the cosmic essence

365
00:15:26.219 --> 00:15:31.219
or Prana in the Indian culture

366
00:15:31.589 --> 00:15:35.050
or Ki in the Japanese culture,

367
00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.809
Chi in the Chinese culture,

368
00:15:37.809 --> 00:15:40.509
Ruach in the Hebrew tradition.

369
00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:41.409
<v Voiceover>Here we are a culture</v>

370
00:15:41.409 --> 00:15:43.519
that barely even breathes

371
00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:45.029
in the United States.

372
00:15:45.029 --> 00:15:46.119
<v ->True.</v>

373
00:15:46.119 --> 00:15:47.609
<v  Voiceover>How do you do ...</v>

374
00:15:47.609 --> 00:15:49.650
How does this work then as you continue

375
00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.989
sharing with us about the breath work?

376
00:15:51.989 --> 00:15:54.430
Your brain has been entrained to some of the

377
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.989
more mystical kinds of music and sound.

378
00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:58.929
Then what occurs?

379
00:15:58.929 --> 00:16:01.629
<v ->You go into what I call a holotropic state,</v>

380
00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:05.289
which is a certain important

381
00:16:05.289 --> 00:16:09.309
subgroup of what we call non-ordinary state.

382
00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:11.429
The things that happen to Shamans

383
00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:13.669
as part of the initiatory crisis

384
00:16:13.669 --> 00:16:16.149
or that they induce in their clients

385
00:16:16.149 --> 00:16:17.609
when they are healing them.

386
00:16:17.609 --> 00:16:19.589
Things that happen in rites of passage

387
00:16:19.589 --> 00:16:21.210
of various native cultures.

388
00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:23.530
Things that were happening to

389
00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.789
the initiates in the ancient mysteries.

390
00:16:25.789 --> 00:16:28.009
The states that are experienced by Yogi's,

391
00:16:28.009 --> 00:16:28.890
by Buddhists,

392
00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:30.189
by Dalit's,

393
00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:31.509
by Sufi's,

394
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:32.489
by Christian mystics,

395
00:16:32.489 --> 00:16:34.229
by the Cabalist's,

396
00:16:34.229 --> 00:16:36.389
Hasidic Jews and so on.

397
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:37.052
It's a non-ordinary ...

398
00:16:37.052 --> 00:16:38.042
<v Voiceover>All of them, by the way,</v>

399
00:16:38.042 --> 00:16:39.602
would have been deemed psychotic

400
00:16:39.602 --> 00:16:40.220
had they gone to ...

401
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.940
<v ->Oh, sure.</v>

402
00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.260
It's not would have been.

403
00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.420
We have, in modern psychiatric literature actually,

404
00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.160
a lot of books and articles

405
00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.470
discussing what would be the best diagnosis.

406
00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:55.460
Ramakrishna was

407
00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.400
a schizophrenic.

408
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:03.100
St. John of the Cross was hereditary degenerative.

409
00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.700
<v Voiceover>Was Buddhists delusional or</v>

410
00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.100
Buddha delusional?

411
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.940
<v ->Sure. He had hallucinations from it,</v>

412
00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.260
so he would be schizophrenic

413
00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.500
or if he happened to function,

414
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:18.050
he would be called borderline.

415
00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.210
There is even a paper by Franz Alexander,

416
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:22.070
who is one of the Founders of

417
00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:23.920
psychosomatic medicine,

418
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.600
where meditation is pathologized.

419
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.000
It's a paper called, "Buddhist training

420
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.180
is artificial catatonia.

421
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.450
Unbelievable approach.

422
00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.170
It pathologizes the whole,

423
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:41.650
not only ritual and spiritual history of humanity

424
00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:45.980
where great religions were started by schizophrenics,

425
00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.070
but also the cultural history

426
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.830
because religion played an enormous role

427
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.770
in human history.

428
00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:57.040
The idea how experiences of schizophrenics

429
00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.340
caused by some kind of unknown brain pathology

430
00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.330
could have ultimately led to building of

431
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.340
cathedrals, gothic cathedrals

432
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.260
or Muslim Mosque's

433
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.160
or Hindu temples.

434
00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.170
That they would inspire great composers,

435
00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:13.780
great artists,

436
00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.360
A lot of people relatively normal

437
00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.960
would give up their personal life

438
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.720
and pursue the ideas of Buddha or ...

439
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.460
<v Voiceover>Basically, we don't want</v>

440
00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:25.520
to take a pill for it.

441
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.460
That's for sure.

442
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.740
How do we go deeper into it

443
00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.120
to help work our way through some of our

444
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.920
living, breathing, every day issues?

445
00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.230
<v ->As I mentioned,</v>

446
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:35.740
the breathing and the music

447
00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.120
induces this non-ordinary state.

448
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.780
Once you are in it,

449
00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.480
those states function as a kind of inner radar

450
00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.280
that things that are in your unconscious

451
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.920
that have a sufficient emotional charge

452
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.260
and they're also close enough to the surface

453
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.880
that they are available

454
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.840
for us to synch,

455
00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.310
they start surfacing.

456
00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:00.040
The content of the unconscious

457
00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.270
starts surfacing into your consciousness

458
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:05.200
and becomes your experience.

459
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.180
The problems, the symptoms,

460
00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.750
get consumed.

461
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.690
They are transformed into a

462
00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:12.640
stream of experiences.

463
00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.620
<v Voiceover>This might look nothing like anything</v>

464
00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:15.840
you would have ever pegged to be

465
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.830
at the root of a problem.

466
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.530
<v ->It's usually very different</v>

467
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:23.480
from what you would think about intellectually

468
00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.760
or what a particular school of therapy

469
00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.900
would tell you

470
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:32.630
that you would choose for your therapy.

471
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:33.289
(peaceful music)

472
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.540
<v Voiceover>A global search</v>

473
00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:38.900
for the truth behind consciousness

474
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.900
is becoming apparent everywhere I go.

475
00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.360
In another of our interviews,

476
00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.960
the respected Science Journalist,

477
00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.200
Graham Hancock,

478
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.260
shares his amazing journey into the

479
00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.080
Brazilian Shamonic world

480
00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.680
where he partakes of Ayahuasca

481
00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.060
Until next time,

482
00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.440
thanks for watching.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.790
