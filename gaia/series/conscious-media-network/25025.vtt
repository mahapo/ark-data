(fast electronic music)

2
00:00:12.634 --> 00:00:14.242
<v ->Brian O'Leary has seen more than just</v>

3
00:00:14.242 --> 00:00:16.012
about any civilian when it comes

4
00:00:16.012 --> 00:00:19.707
to the world of free energy, or zero-point energy devices.

5
00:00:19.707 --> 00:00:23.181
As an idealistic young PhD in space sciences,

6
00:00:23.181 --> 00:00:25.854
he was slated to go to Mars on a NASA mission

7
00:00:25.854 --> 00:00:29.118
when the Vietnam War shifted the US' priorities.

8
00:00:29.118 --> 00:00:30.958
Instead, he became a professor,

9
00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.658
teaching at Cornell alongside Carl Sagan

10
00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:35.930
and later at Princeton in the Physics Department.

11
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.225
Ultimately, his broad curiosity

12
00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:40.403
about future technologies in space

13
00:00:40.403 --> 00:00:42.019
brought him to the understanding

14
00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:44.972
that only through free and clean energy

15
00:00:44.972 --> 00:00:47.341
can we progress as a global species.

16
00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:49.414
The rub has been that vested interests

17
00:00:49.414 --> 00:00:52.423
have thwarted this progress at every turn.

18
00:00:52.423 --> 00:00:55.130
(steady rhythmic electronic music)

19
00:01:00.942 --> 00:01:03.048
I'm very happy to be sitting here with you.

20
00:01:03.048 --> 00:01:05.122
I met you the first time about 10 years ago,

21
00:01:05.122 --> 00:01:07.728
but I've known of your work for many years prior to that.

22
00:01:07.728 --> 00:01:11.971
And you have been, you've had a very illustrious career,

23
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:16.071
but you've been almost, hmm.

24
00:01:16.071 --> 00:01:19.236
You have to, by now, be almost somewhat

25
00:01:19.236 --> 00:01:21.247
of a brokenhearted dreamer to have gone

26
00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:23.103
through as much as you've gone through

27
00:01:23.103 --> 00:01:25.116
to end up where we are today,

28
00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:29.514
which is well, practically speaking,

29
00:01:29.514 --> 00:01:30.919
not very far advanced of where we were

30
00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:32.292
when you started this whole dance.

31
00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:33.073
(laughter)

32
00:01:33.073 --> 00:01:35.859
And so, I would love it, in your book,

33
00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:38.618
you wrote a letter to the younger generation,

34
00:01:38.618 --> 00:01:41.319
which has a lot to do with apologies and regrets

35
00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.734
for our generations.

36
00:01:43.734 --> 00:01:46.591
And maybe you can start there.

37
00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:50.836
What propelled you to begin with,

38
00:01:50.836 --> 00:01:53.175
through to now, and the things

39
00:01:53.175 --> 00:01:55.212
that have basically caused you,

40
00:01:55.212 --> 00:01:57.075
forced you to write this letter of apology

41
00:01:57.075 --> 00:01:59.056
to my son's generation?

42
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.919
<v ->Well, yes I just turned 70,</v>

43
00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:07.506
so I feel like now it is time to pass on

44
00:02:07.506 --> 00:02:10.682
some of the knowledge that I've gained.

45
00:02:10.682 --> 00:02:13.991
And it does appear to be a difficult road,

46
00:02:13.991 --> 00:02:16.567
but actually it isn't that hard

47
00:02:16.567 --> 00:02:19.095
when I reflect on the fact.

48
00:02:19.095 --> 00:02:21.264
There's a famous I. F. Stone quote is

49
00:02:21.264 --> 00:02:23.204
that "if you expect the see the final results

50
00:02:23.204 --> 00:02:26.435
"of your work, you haven't asked a big enough question."

51
00:02:26.435 --> 00:02:27.400
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

52
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.444
<v ->And the questions that we're asking now,</v>

53
00:02:30.444 --> 00:02:34.243
if we look at the big picture, are really important.

54
00:02:34.243 --> 00:02:36.709
And although they may not impact me

55
00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.923
in this body, at this time,

56
00:02:38.923 --> 00:02:41.419
they will impact future generations.

57
00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.862
So, it's very important that the future generations know

58
00:02:44.862 --> 00:02:48.331
what some of us have learned

59
00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:50.552
in our long lifetimes.

60
00:02:50.552 --> 00:02:54.434
And so, my own path was,

61
00:02:54.434 --> 00:02:56.842
I had this passionate desire

62
00:02:56.842 --> 00:03:00.277
ever since I was a little kid to explore space.

63
00:03:00.277 --> 00:03:04.415
So, I was very keen on reading any and every book

64
00:03:04.415 --> 00:03:07.812
about rocketry, books by Wernher von Braun,

65
00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:10.073
car, Arthur C. Clarke.

66
00:03:10.073 --> 00:03:13.257
I was convinced that there would be a space program.

67
00:03:13.257 --> 00:03:14.416
Indeed, there was.

68
00:03:14.416 --> 00:03:17.994
In fact, the space program happened so fast

69
00:03:17.994 --> 00:03:21.166
that I turned out to be almost too young

70
00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:23.287
to go to the moon, not too old,

71
00:03:23.287 --> 00:03:25.300
even though people thought I was crazy

72
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.772
when I was kid that I wanted to go to the moon or to Mars.

73
00:03:28.772 --> 00:03:32.137
But, in fact, the space program happened very quickly.

74
00:03:32.137 --> 00:03:36.393
It also, the vital part of the space program ended quickly.

75
00:03:37.644 --> 00:03:40.909
I was appointed to go to Mars as an astronaut,

76
00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.644
and then they cut the program because of Vietnam.

77
00:03:44.644 --> 00:03:48.518
So then, I became a major war protester,

78
00:03:48.518 --> 00:03:50.323
March on Washington,

79
00:03:50.323 --> 00:03:54.533
I became a professor at Cornell with Carl Sagan,

80
00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:58.605
and got involved in planetary exploration for a while

81
00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:00.430
through the use of robots.

82
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.925
That was a lot of fun.

83
00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:04.534
And at that time, you see,

84
00:04:04.534 --> 00:04:06.472
I hadn't become an environmentalist.

85
00:04:06.472 --> 00:04:10.473
I hadn't returned my focus onto the Earth.

86
00:04:10.473 --> 00:04:12.907
And it was only much later when I

87
00:04:12.907 --> 00:04:15.218
started to have my own epiphany

88
00:04:15.218 --> 00:04:17.789
and I left the mainstream.

89
00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.822
I began to realize that the environmental problems

90
00:04:22.822 --> 00:04:24.724
we have on the Earth are far greater

91
00:04:24.724 --> 00:04:28.282
than what virtually anybody has acknowledged.

92
00:04:29.061 --> 00:04:31.967
And the problems are so huge

93
00:04:31.967 --> 00:04:36.025
that my whole life has been around seeking solutions.

94
00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:40.338
But, my whole life, the second half of my life.

95
00:04:40.338 --> 00:04:41.878
<v Voiceover>Right, I understand.</v>

96
00:04:41.878 --> 00:04:44.272
And so, what was, if you can go ahead

97
00:04:44.272 --> 00:04:46.232
and characterize what you passed on

98
00:04:46.232 --> 00:04:49.282
in that letter of apology to the youth.

99
00:04:49.282 --> 00:04:51.128
What are the key points?

100
00:04:52.013 --> 00:04:53.423
<v ->Well, the key points of the letter.</v>

101
00:04:53.423 --> 00:04:55.258
The key points of what I'm about,

102
00:04:55.258 --> 00:04:57.552
the apology is that our generation

103
00:04:57.552 --> 00:04:59.693
has been very irresponsible.

104
00:04:59.693 --> 00:05:03.932
We have brought in leaders that have

105
00:05:03.932 --> 00:05:06.256
basically been puppets.

106
00:05:06.256 --> 00:05:10.640
That in the public domain, whether it's

107
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.731
the scientific community, the media,

108
00:05:13.731 --> 00:05:16.802
the institutions that have been established

109
00:05:19.802 --> 00:05:21.674
ostensibly for the public good.

110
00:05:21.674 --> 00:05:23.413
None of them has delivered.

111
00:05:23.413 --> 00:05:27.294
And that the word sustainability has become almost a joke.

112
00:05:28.188 --> 00:05:30.861
That the Earth, as we know it,

113
00:05:30.861 --> 00:05:33.289
is going downhill very fast.

114
00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:38.060
That the people that claim sustainability

115
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.628
and use excuses that they're doing their part

116
00:05:42.628 --> 00:05:44.172
is sort of like a tiny fraction

117
00:05:44.172 --> 00:05:46.340
of what's really going to be necessary.

118
00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.963
And that we're gonna have to look

119
00:05:47.963 --> 00:05:51.068
at very, very basic change.

120
00:05:51.068 --> 00:05:54.452
We're gonna have to rely more on consciousness

121
00:05:54.452 --> 00:05:56.044
as the ground of all being

122
00:05:56.044 --> 00:05:59.241
rather than reductionistic Western science.

123
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:03.937
And science itself is in a big crisis.

124
00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.466
There's a belief system that we sometimes call scientism

125
00:06:09.466 --> 00:06:13.536
which is a basically a religion that says

126
00:06:13.536 --> 00:06:17.093
anything and everything that we know about

127
00:06:17.093 --> 00:06:20.244
can be proven or disproven in the laboratory.

128
00:06:20.244 --> 00:06:22.211
And that's certainly not true.
<v Voiceover>Not true.</v>

129
00:06:22.211 --> 00:06:26.550
<v ->And in terms of my own growth, personal growth,</v>

130
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.852
around 1979, when I was on the faculty

131
00:06:30.852 --> 00:06:33.756
at Princeton University in the Physics Department,

132
00:06:33.756 --> 00:06:35.953
I went to a Lifespring training.

133
00:06:35.953 --> 00:06:38.228
I had a remote viewing experience.

134
00:06:38.228 --> 00:06:42.393
I was able to tune into a person that I didn't know,

135
00:06:42.393 --> 00:06:46.505
and I had it very accurately described.

136
00:06:46.505 --> 00:06:49.601
And that was the first of what was

137
00:06:49.601 --> 00:06:53.377
to be many experiences I had

138
00:06:53.377 --> 00:06:57.136
that violated the rules and regulations of Western science

139
00:06:57.136 --> 00:06:58.813
such as we knew them.

140
00:06:58.813 --> 00:07:02.439
So that I then had a near-death experience

141
00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:03.609
in an auto accident.

142
00:07:03.609 --> 00:07:05.941
I lifted out of my body.

143
00:07:05.941 --> 00:07:07.754
Around that time, I had no idea

144
00:07:07.754 --> 00:07:09.723
that these things were possible.

145
00:07:09.723 --> 00:07:12.089
So, I was a good subject.

146
00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:13.792
I had a healing experience,

147
00:07:13.792 --> 00:07:15.865
and all of these experiences then

148
00:07:15.865 --> 00:07:18.703
led me to ask the question,

149
00:07:18.703 --> 00:07:21.122
well, are many of these phenomena

150
00:07:21.122 --> 00:07:24.226
that lie outside the box of Western science,

151
00:07:24.226 --> 00:07:26.975
are these susceptible to scientific inquiry

152
00:07:26.975 --> 00:07:29.078
using scientific methods?

153
00:07:29.078 --> 00:07:30.981
And I found that they were.

154
00:07:30.981 --> 00:07:34.118
And then, that began my exploration.

155
00:07:34.118 --> 00:07:38.145
And I pretty much had to leave Princeton at that point which

156
00:07:38.145 --> 00:07:40.357
I'm glad I did.
<v Voiceover>Not surprisingly.</v>

157
00:07:40.357 --> 00:07:42.969
<v ->Which I'm glad I did in retrospect.</v>

158
00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:46.654
<v Voiceover>John Mack, for example,</v>

159
00:07:46.654 --> 00:07:49.711
you know, when he went outside the box.

160
00:07:49.711 --> 00:07:53.338
He had a clinical psychology at Harvard.

161
00:07:53.338 --> 00:07:55.260
When he went outside the box,

162
00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.893
it was only minutes before they tried

163
00:07:57.893 --> 00:07:59.941
to strip him of his tenure and so forth.

164
00:07:59.941 --> 00:08:01.904
And we know anybody who knows a little bit

165
00:08:01.904 --> 00:08:05.748
about that particular movement, abductees, UFOs,

166
00:08:05.748 --> 00:08:07.749
and consciousness and such,

167
00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:09.404
can look up Dr. John Mack.

168
00:08:09.404 --> 00:08:11.311
But, you could very easily have slipped

169
00:08:11.311 --> 00:08:13.855
into a very uncomfortable circumstance.

170
00:08:13.855 --> 00:08:16.928
<v ->That's right, and so in a way I think</v>

171
00:08:16.928 --> 00:08:20.267
I'm glad I left before that came down on me.

172
00:08:21.207 --> 00:08:22.758
Little did I realize at the time

173
00:08:22.758 --> 00:08:26.193
that over in the Engineering Quadrangle at Princeton,

174
00:08:26.193 --> 00:08:30.137
Robert Jahn was doing his experiments in the PEAR labs.

175
00:08:30.137 --> 00:08:33.234
These were experiments in consciousness research

176
00:08:33.234 --> 00:08:35.245
where operators in he lab were able

177
00:08:35.245 --> 00:08:38.658
to influence the result of random event generators.

178
00:08:39.667 --> 00:08:42.200
These are little digital coin flips

179
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.813
that basically could be influenced

180
00:08:44.813 --> 00:08:46.889
though human intention.

181
00:08:46.889 --> 00:08:49.606
And that everybody had their own psychic signature

182
00:08:49.606 --> 00:08:52.410
even people that weren't psychically gifted.

183
00:08:53.348 --> 00:08:55.564
And while he was doing those experiments,

184
00:08:55.564 --> 00:08:57.265
they tried to run him out of Princeton.

185
00:08:57.265 --> 00:08:59.003
<v Voiceover>Right, and at the same time,</v>

186
00:08:59.003 --> 00:09:00.673
this was when Russell Targ and others

187
00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:02.571
were working on very similar experiments

188
00:09:02.571 --> 00:09:06.994
at other facilities, and under funding by the CIA

189
00:09:06.994 --> 00:09:09.505
because this was very valuable technology.

190
00:09:09.505 --> 00:09:10.575
<v ->Right, the CIA knows</v>

191
00:09:10.575 --> 00:09:11.779
what's going on.
<v Voiceover>Sure, they do.</v>

192
00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:15.986
<v ->But, the rest of us seem to be divided and ruled</v>

193
00:09:15.986 --> 00:09:20.121
by these malevolent sinister forces,

194
00:09:20.121 --> 00:09:21.724
and that's something which I grew

195
00:09:21.724 --> 00:09:23.758
to appreciate more and more,

196
00:09:23.758 --> 00:09:26.797
commenently with my own exploration

197
00:09:26.797 --> 00:09:28.964
of the phenomena of consciousness.

198
00:09:28.964 --> 00:09:30.967
<v Voiceover>So, let's talk about that a little bit</v>

199
00:09:30.967 --> 00:09:32.933
because this takes us into some of the regrets

200
00:09:32.933 --> 00:09:35.330
of your generation, my generation,

201
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:39.229
into what we're handing down into my son's generation.

202
00:09:39.229 --> 00:09:42.179
And this has to do with the fact

203
00:09:42.179 --> 00:09:46.465
that non-polluting freely available energy sources

204
00:09:46.465 --> 00:09:48.138
have been not only conceived of,

205
00:09:48.138 --> 00:09:52.319
but born out through various devices

206
00:09:52.319 --> 00:09:54.923
that have been created all over the world

207
00:09:54.923 --> 00:09:57.061
for really decades now.

208
00:09:57.061 --> 00:09:58.893
It's not a totally new phenomenon

209
00:09:58.893 --> 00:10:01.351
that the prototypes of these devices exist.

210
00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:02.220
We all know that.

211
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.530
That should be common knowledge.

212
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.358
In fact, we'll show something on YouTube in a little bit.

213
00:10:06.358 --> 00:10:08.758
It's so common, you can go to YouTube and find this.

214
00:10:08.758 --> 00:10:11.570
Yet, none of this has really made it

215
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.409
to the light of day.

216
00:10:13.409 --> 00:10:17.243
And this becomes so murky because you're

217
00:10:17.243 --> 00:10:21.567
getting into governmental, as you say, industry,

218
00:10:22.551 --> 00:10:26.507
the more private secret hidden factions of the government.

219
00:10:27.149 --> 00:10:31.862
Intelligence communties, UFO phenomena.

220
00:10:31.862 --> 00:10:34.666
It all seems to come together as soon

221
00:10:34.666 --> 00:10:37.764
as you start talking about freely available

222
00:10:37.764 --> 00:10:40.159
or zero-point energy.

223
00:10:40.159 --> 00:10:43.406
<v ->Yes, you know, it took me a long time</v>

224
00:10:43.406 --> 00:10:47.795
to, even I resisted addressing the question of free energy

225
00:10:47.795 --> 00:10:51.026
or zero-point energy or vacuum energy

226
00:10:51.026 --> 00:10:55.214
or any of the more esoteric sounding energy sources

227
00:10:55.214 --> 00:10:58.242
which have been out there and researched

228
00:10:58.242 --> 00:10:59.565
for quite a while.

229
00:10:59.565 --> 00:11:03.491
And so, I finally decided to address that question

230
00:11:03.491 --> 00:11:07.360
in the early 1990s, late 1980s.

231
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.385
I traveled the world.

232
00:11:08.385 --> 00:11:12.603
I visited many of the most promising inventors

233
00:11:12.603 --> 00:11:15.169
and researchers, and found that there

234
00:11:15.169 --> 00:11:17.807
are devices of all kinds out there

235
00:11:17.807 --> 00:11:21.477
that are not at the practical stage,

236
00:11:21.477 --> 00:11:24.546
as practical devices that we can use.

237
00:11:24.546 --> 00:11:27.447
It's like there are a lot of Wright brothers out there

238
00:11:27.447 --> 00:11:29.720
testing out and proving the concept,

239
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.886
but that we haven't gone through the critical step yet

240
00:11:32.886 --> 00:11:37.158
of actually developing a real device

241
00:11:37.158 --> 00:11:39.264
that people can generally use.

242
00:11:39.264 --> 00:11:41.965
<v Voiceover>That's very inexpensive and accessible to all?</v>

243
00:11:41.965 --> 00:11:45.466
<v ->Exactly, and I am fully confident,</v>

244
00:11:45.466 --> 00:11:48.604
by the way that any one or some of these technologies

245
00:11:48.604 --> 00:11:50.925
can be implemented if we had the will,

246
00:11:50.925 --> 00:11:52.940
if we have the courage.

247
00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.900
Then, we can move ahead into this.

248
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.616
And I also feel that this option,

249
00:11:59.616 --> 00:12:02.309
the option of so-called free energy,

250
00:12:02.309 --> 00:12:05.789
is the only option available to us now

251
00:12:05.789 --> 00:12:09.112
that makes any sense in meeting even a fraction

252
00:12:09.112 --> 00:12:12.481
of the total energy demand of the world.

253
00:12:13.196 --> 00:12:15.490
So, we have this two-edged sword now.

254
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:17.859
We have a situation in which there

255
00:12:17.859 --> 00:12:20.839
have been literally hundreds to thousands

256
00:12:20.839 --> 00:12:23.164
of inventors out there that have been divided

257
00:12:23.164 --> 00:12:25.472
and ruled and suppressed.

258
00:12:25.472 --> 00:12:29.013
And we have a concept, whose physics

259
00:12:29.013 --> 00:12:31.372
is gotten much better known.

260
00:12:31.372 --> 00:12:35.298
I've made it a personal study through the years,

261
00:12:35.298 --> 00:12:38.083
over the last three decades actually

262
00:12:38.083 --> 00:12:42.591
to prove to myself that it's experimentally viable

263
00:12:42.591 --> 00:12:45.462
that with a concerted research and development effort,

264
00:12:45.462 --> 00:12:49.127
we can come up with some extraordinary technologies

265
00:12:49.127 --> 00:12:53.062
for clean, cheap, decentralized energy.

266
00:12:53.924 --> 00:12:58.066
And it would just blow the whole energy prices wide open,

267
00:12:58.066 --> 00:13:01.213
and we could solve our principle problem

268
00:13:01.213 --> 00:13:04.510
of sustainability which is that we've

269
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.190
been using very dirty energy.

270
00:13:07.938 --> 00:13:09.545
<v Voiceover>And can I just say something here?</v>

271
00:13:09.545 --> 00:13:13.822
It doesn't matter whether you're for the prevailing agendas

272
00:13:13.822 --> 00:13:15.380
having to do with global warming

273
00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.518
or whether you're not.

274
00:13:16.518 --> 00:13:20.022
The point is, we're using filthy energy.

275
00:13:20.022 --> 00:13:23.808
We're creating huge socioeconomic

276
00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.360
chaos around the planet as a result of trying

277
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.604
to extract and own these resources.

278
00:13:29.604 --> 00:13:31.770
I mean, there's every single reason not

279
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.533
to be dependent on this anymore,

280
00:13:33.533 --> 00:13:35.905
aside from what's going on globally.

281
00:13:35.905 --> 00:13:39.493
And just forget the degradation of the environment.

282
00:13:39.493 --> 00:13:41.084
I mean, that's something that often seems

283
00:13:41.084 --> 00:13:42.844
to get buried now.
<v Brian>Yes.</v>

284
00:13:42.844 --> 00:13:45.821
<v Voiceover>Just to have a very polluted, unclean,</v>

285
00:13:45.821 --> 00:13:49.626
unsustainable environment at ground level.

286
00:13:49.626 --> 00:13:51.319
And I just wanted to say, it doesn't matter

287
00:13:51.319 --> 00:13:53.591
what your feelings are and who's camp you're in

288
00:13:53.591 --> 00:13:55.696
on global warming.
<v Brian>That's right.</v>

289
00:13:55.696 --> 00:13:56.820
<v Voiceover>This extends far beyond that.</v>

290
00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.487
<v ->Yeah, this transcends the global warming</v>

291
00:13:58.487 --> 00:14:00.052
climate change issue.

292
00:14:01.192 --> 00:14:02.437
Issues come and go.

293
00:14:02.437 --> 00:14:03.939
They're like fads.
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

294
00:14:03.939 --> 00:14:08.110
<v ->And I subscribe to the precautionary principle</v>

295
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:11.915
that if there's any chance that the climate change

296
00:14:11.915 --> 00:14:14.631
is as drastic as it appears to be,

297
00:14:15.676 --> 00:14:19.356
based on the analyses of the climate science community,

298
00:14:19.356 --> 00:14:22.383
then we had better very quickly go off

299
00:14:22.383 --> 00:14:25.420
of our addiction to oil and coal

300
00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.823
and any of the fossil fuels.

301
00:14:27.823 --> 00:14:30.865
We should even get off of our addiction to biofuels

302
00:14:30.865 --> 00:14:33.684
which are no great bargain.

303
00:14:33.684 --> 00:14:36.732
In fact, it's been calculated by some people

304
00:14:36.732 --> 00:14:39.611
like David Pimentel at Cornell University,

305
00:14:39.611 --> 00:14:44.035
professor of biology, that if you

306
00:14:44.035 --> 00:14:48.504
had an economy based on ethanol from corn,

307
00:14:48.504 --> 00:14:50.445
you actually would use more hydrocarbons,

308
00:14:50.445 --> 00:14:52.754
more fossil fuels than if you were

309
00:14:52.754 --> 00:14:55.015
to just use the fossil fuels because

310
00:14:55.015 --> 00:14:58.229
of the infrastructure development around that.

311
00:14:58.229 --> 00:15:01.958
And so, in my own world, and I've had years

312
00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.625
and years of history as an energy advisor

313
00:15:04.625 --> 00:15:08.102
to presidential candidates, and as a professor

314
00:15:08.102 --> 00:15:09.940
of energy studies.
<v Voiceover>A lot of time</v>

315
00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.704
in DC where it was happening.
<v Brian>Yes, yes</v>

316
00:15:12.704 --> 00:15:16.812
with Morris Udall when he ran for president in 1975.

317
00:15:17.912 --> 00:15:21.089
So, given my years and years of experience,

318
00:15:21.089 --> 00:15:24.407
I would encourage younger people, for example,

319
00:15:24.407 --> 00:15:25.682
I would love a graduate student

320
00:15:25.682 --> 00:15:30.157
to get his hands around the topic of well, let's honestly

321
00:15:30.157 --> 00:15:34.618
assess all alternative energy sources,

322
00:15:34.618 --> 00:15:38.601
the ones we now have, the ones that we could have,

323
00:15:38.601 --> 00:15:41.468
in a more open world.

324
00:15:41.468 --> 00:15:43.794
And let's just see how they stack up

325
00:15:43.794 --> 00:15:48.477
in terms of their full lifecycle environmental costs.

326
00:15:49.387 --> 00:15:51.115
And what people neglect to do,

327
00:15:51.115 --> 00:15:53.346
they see fragments of it.

328
00:15:53.346 --> 00:15:55.447
And there is a promotional bias,

329
00:15:55.447 --> 00:15:59.788
like you'll hear from in this very, very commercial world,

330
00:15:59.788 --> 00:16:04.622
you'll hear some people propose biofields, others hydrogen.

331
00:16:04.622 --> 00:16:08.062
Others saying, "Oh, we have the answer, fuel cells."

332
00:16:09.032 --> 00:16:11.330
Or somebody else might say solar,

333
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.827
this kind of solar or this kind of wind power,

334
00:16:13.827 --> 00:16:16.931
or this kind of hydropower, or geothermal power.

335
00:16:16.931 --> 00:16:19.006
And the people that talk about these things

336
00:16:19.006 --> 00:16:23.110
usually promote that to the exclusion of other things.

337
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:25.777
And one of the great disappointments I found

338
00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:29.946
in my own analyses is that there's a problem

339
00:16:29.946 --> 00:16:31.842
with each one of them.

340
00:16:31.842 --> 00:16:35.751
I would love to be a solar advocate, and I am.

341
00:16:35.751 --> 00:16:37.127
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about the problem with solar</v>

342
00:16:37.127 --> 00:16:39.814
from what you have been able to ascertain.

343
00:16:39.814 --> 00:16:44.455
<v ->Well, the problem with solar, in terms of it fulfilling</v>

344
00:16:44.455 --> 00:16:46.593
the current energy demand of the world,

345
00:16:46.593 --> 00:16:51.363
or even a fraction of it, is that the materials' costs

346
00:16:51.363 --> 00:16:53.775
and the environmental cost of developing

347
00:16:53.775 --> 00:16:56.129
the materials for solar collectors

348
00:16:56.129 --> 00:16:59.843
for the whole planet is prohibitive.

349
00:16:59.843 --> 00:17:02.915
It's about $20 to $40 trillion dollars,

350
00:17:02.915 --> 00:17:06.121
and the amount of mining of materials

351
00:17:06.121 --> 00:17:09.117
would just ruin the face of the Earth.

352
00:17:09.117 --> 00:17:11.522
You just can't do it.

353
00:17:11.522 --> 00:17:13.294
I wish you could.

354
00:17:13.294 --> 00:17:14.995
I wish we didn't have to go into this--

355
00:17:14.995 --> 00:17:16.399
<v Voiceover>Well, it sounds so clean.</v>

356
00:17:16.399 --> 00:17:18.130
Gather free energy from the sun.

357
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.197
But, you're right, yes the interface between

358
00:17:21.197 --> 00:17:24.741
energetic output and the sun can be very,

359
00:17:24.741 --> 00:17:26.374
as you say costly and damaging

360
00:17:26.374 --> 00:17:28.544
to the environment as well, right?

361
00:17:28.544 --> 00:17:30.379
<v ->That's right, and the same is true of wind power.</v>

362
00:17:30.379 --> 00:17:33.412
The windmills litter the landscape.

363
00:17:33.412 --> 00:17:36.754
You'd have to have literally millions and millions

364
00:17:36.754 --> 00:17:39.978
and millions of them to have any appreciable dent

365
00:17:39.978 --> 00:17:42.056
on the whole energy economy.

366
00:17:42.056 --> 00:17:45.921
And the materials used and the replacement of parts,

367
00:17:45.921 --> 00:17:49.354
the disposal of parts that are no longer useful

368
00:17:49.354 --> 00:17:51.472
becomes a big problem.

369
00:17:51.472 --> 00:17:54.358
All you have to do is see the YouTube video

370
00:17:54.358 --> 00:17:56.103
The Story of Stuff with Annie Leonard.

371
00:17:56.103 --> 00:17:57.163
<v Voiceover>Yes, that's wonderful.</v>

372
00:17:57.163 --> 00:17:59.068
<v ->From cradle to grave, you're dealing</v>

373
00:17:59.068 --> 00:18:03.546
with a very intensive

374
00:18:03.546 --> 00:18:05.778
environmentally damaging system.

375
00:18:05.778 --> 00:18:08.580
And if you're really serious about sustainability,

376
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.288
you're gonna have to look outside the box.

377
00:18:12.288 --> 00:18:15.314
And of course, this is where free energy comes in.

378
00:18:15.314 --> 00:18:19.181
The concepts of free energy are alive and well,

379
00:18:19.181 --> 00:18:22.266
but they must be responsibly implemented.

380
00:18:22.266 --> 00:18:24.467
<v Voiceover>Well, and not just responsibly implemented.</v>

381
00:18:24.467 --> 00:18:27.236
They have to first of all, stop being suppressed.

382
00:18:27.236 --> 00:18:29.574
We're talking about some of the,

383
00:18:29.574 --> 00:18:31.570
you know I've interviewed a lot of people

384
00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:35.512
in what is termed the conspiracy world,

385
00:18:35.512 --> 00:18:38.981
and a lot of their concerns are for very good reason.

386
00:18:38.981 --> 00:18:42.278
You bumped up against it yourself in this arena.

387
00:18:42.278 --> 00:18:44.416
If you wouldn't mind making comment

388
00:18:44.416 --> 00:18:46.256
on a couple of people, for example,

389
00:18:46.256 --> 00:18:48.894
such as your friend, Eugene Mallove.

390
00:18:48.894 --> 00:18:51.322
I would love to know more about that story.

391
00:18:51.322 --> 00:18:52.852
I mean, I've read about him in your book,

392
00:18:52.852 --> 00:18:54.699
and the whole story of cold fusion.

393
00:18:54.699 --> 00:18:57.424
What he put on the line to try to bring truth out.

394
00:18:57.424 --> 00:18:59.824
People need to start understanding

395
00:18:59.824 --> 00:19:01.872
what these people have been up against.

396
00:19:01.872 --> 00:19:05.329
<v ->Yes, yes, I had a bumper sticker for a number of years</v>

397
00:19:05.329 --> 00:19:06.907
that said, the truth will set you free,

398
00:19:06.907 --> 00:19:08.405
but first it will piss you off.

399
00:19:08.405 --> 00:19:09.937
<v Voiceover>(laughs) Or kill you.</v>

400
00:19:09.937 --> 00:19:13.307
<v ->Or kill you, yes it does engender</v>

401
00:19:13.307 --> 00:19:16.049
a great deal of resistance.

402
00:19:16.049 --> 00:19:18.922
Another wonderful quote, Burton Russell,

403
00:19:18.922 --> 00:19:21.514
"The resistance to a new idea increases

404
00:19:21.514 --> 00:19:24.291
"as the square of its importance."

405
00:19:24.291 --> 00:19:27.757
And throughout history, the most important ideas

406
00:19:27.757 --> 00:19:31.056
have been scuttled by the mainstream.

407
00:19:31.056 --> 00:19:34.770
And people don't want it because they

408
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:37.967
unconsciously, especially, but to a degree,

409
00:19:37.967 --> 00:19:41.868
consciously feel that threatens their way of life.

410
00:19:41.868 --> 00:19:43.742
And that certainly is what's going on now.

411
00:19:43.742 --> 00:19:47.875
Here we are talking about a multi-trillion dollar per year

412
00:19:47.875 --> 00:19:51.560
energy economy that's based mostly on oil.

413
00:19:52.214 --> 00:19:55.945
And everywhere in world, we're all addicted to oil.

414
00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:57.023
We all use it.

415
00:19:57.023 --> 00:20:01.177
It's the only show in town, basically, for running our cars.

416
00:20:01.177 --> 00:20:04.050
And the other hydrocarbons, coal, oil

417
00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:07.903
for generating electricity, or nuclear power.

418
00:20:07.903 --> 00:20:11.025
And these are all bad news.

419
00:20:11.025 --> 00:20:14.474
I hate to say it, but the world is being destoyed

420
00:20:14.474 --> 00:20:16.376
by these technologies.

421
00:20:16.376 --> 00:20:18.978
It's really that extreme.

422
00:20:18.978 --> 00:20:23.168
And we don't have to look that far into that question.

423
00:20:24.318 --> 00:20:27.154
Certainly, your viewers, if you wanna know

424
00:20:27.154 --> 00:20:30.227
more about it, the information is out there in spades.

425
00:20:30.227 --> 00:20:32.458
<v Voiceover>You have a load of it on your website.</v>

426
00:20:32.458 --> 00:20:34.362
If you wanna know anything about any technology,

427
00:20:34.362 --> 00:20:36.964
there's almost nothing you can't find on your website.

428
00:20:36.964 --> 00:20:39.057
So, we'll guide people to that in a bit.

429
00:20:39.057 --> 00:20:42.102
But, let's talk about some of the really profound potentials

430
00:20:42.102 --> 00:20:42.904
that have come out.

431
00:20:42.904 --> 00:20:44.005
Let's talk about cold fusion.

432
00:20:44.005 --> 00:20:45.670
Let's talk about Eugene.

433
00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:50.132
<v ->Well, OK, cold fusion, which is a funny term</v>

434
00:20:50.132 --> 00:20:53.376
and it may not actually be the term that sticks.

435
00:20:53.376 --> 00:20:55.609
That's part of the problem is that we,

436
00:20:55.609 --> 00:20:59.579
sometimes we don't even know how to find the words

437
00:20:59.579 --> 00:21:03.114
to describe what we're talking about because it's so new.

438
00:21:03.114 --> 00:21:05.054
But, cold fusion

439
00:21:05.054 --> 00:21:09.968
or low-energy radioactive,

440
00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:13.520
no high energy, low radioactive

441
00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:19.331
induced, chemically induced nuclear reactions

442
00:21:19.331 --> 00:21:23.207
is a very interesting,

443
00:21:23.207 --> 00:21:26.390
almost accidental discovery in 1989

444
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:30.508
by two chemists at the University of Utah,

445
00:21:32.398 --> 00:21:34.619
Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann who discovered

446
00:21:34.619 --> 00:21:38.661
that if you dip a palladium alloy into a solution

447
00:21:38.661 --> 00:21:43.097
of heavy water and you send an electrical current,

448
00:21:44.117 --> 00:21:47.465
then you find that nuclear reactions

449
00:21:47.465 --> 00:21:49.837
might occur on the cathode,

450
00:21:49.837 --> 00:21:53.002
generating an enormous amount of heat energy.

451
00:21:53.002 --> 00:21:56.641
And this experiment has been

452
00:21:56.641 --> 00:22:00.148
replicated many times since then.

453
00:22:00.148 --> 00:22:04.852
And the science writer for MIT, the chief science writer

454
00:22:04.852 --> 00:22:09.098
Eugene Mallove, who himself has a doctorate in the sciences,

455
00:22:11.019 --> 00:22:13.424
discovered that the MIT scientists,

456
00:22:13.424 --> 00:22:15.565
the nuclear physicists that tried

457
00:22:15.565 --> 00:22:18.929
to replicate the results

458
00:22:18.929 --> 00:22:22.767
of Fleischmann and Pons committed fraud

459
00:22:22.767 --> 00:22:27.067
in not really honestly

460
00:22:27.067 --> 00:22:30.240
reporting on their replication.

461
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.940
<v Voiceover>'Cause they were trying to disprove?</v>

462
00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.141
<v ->They were trying to disprove it</v>

463
00:22:33.141 --> 00:22:35.346
because their vested interest

464
00:22:35.346 --> 00:22:40.290
wasn't hot nuclear tokamak fusion reaction

465
00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:42.193
simulating the inside of the sun,

466
00:22:42.193 --> 00:22:45.287
and building these behemoth reactors.

467
00:22:45.287 --> 00:22:47.559
Tens of billions of dollars of tax money

468
00:22:47.559 --> 00:22:49.728
and so forth and so on.

469
00:22:49.728 --> 00:22:53.705
And these people's careers relied on the success,

470
00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:56.402
or potential success of that approach.

471
00:22:56.402 --> 00:22:58.638
And then, here you have a couple of chemists

472
00:22:58.638 --> 00:23:01.911
from the University of Utah coming up

473
00:23:01.911 --> 00:23:05.840
with some results at room temperature

474
00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.119
on a tabletop apparatus.

475
00:23:08.119 --> 00:23:10.912
So, you're dealing with a whole different approach

476
00:23:10.912 --> 00:23:13.988
to the question, and one that raises the hackles

477
00:23:13.988 --> 00:23:16.460
of the vested interest.

478
00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.554
And so, this has happened throughout the history of science.

479
00:23:19.554 --> 00:23:20.630
<v Voiceover>But Eugene was brave enough</v>

480
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.224
to take this on?

481
00:23:23.164 --> 00:23:25.592
<v ->Gene Mallove took it on,</v>

482
00:23:25.592 --> 00:23:30.083
and he told the truth and it was very painful.

483
00:23:30.951 --> 00:23:35.557
He was basically shoved out of MIT for his heresy.

484
00:23:36.395 --> 00:23:38.306
He then went on his own and began

485
00:23:38.306 --> 00:23:40.939
editing Infinity Energy magazine

486
00:23:40.939 --> 00:23:43.853
and became one of the world's foremost spokesmen

487
00:23:43.853 --> 00:23:46.115
for new energy technologies,

488
00:23:46.115 --> 00:23:50.420
and was quite a force in doing that.

489
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:54.091
And in the year '04, he was brutally murdered.

490
00:23:54.091 --> 00:23:56.531
Now, we don't know exactly the motive.

491
00:23:56.531 --> 00:23:59.865
Of course, many of these murders that do take place

492
00:23:59.865 --> 00:24:03.301
of some of the leading researchers in energy,

493
00:24:05.981 --> 00:24:08.474
their death, the cause of their death,

494
00:24:08.474 --> 00:24:11.143
is not necessarily--

495
00:24:11.143 --> 00:24:13.082
<v Voiceover>They don't leave notes.</v>

496
00:24:13.082 --> 00:24:15.110
<v ->They don't leave notes, that's for one thing.</v>

497
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.067
Some of them are--
<v Voiceover>The perpetrator</v>

498
00:24:17.067 --> 00:24:19.853
doesn't leave a note (laughs) compliments of.

499
00:24:19.853 --> 00:24:22.412
<v ->No, and there's almost always a cover story</v>

500
00:24:22.412 --> 00:24:25.486
or another interpretation of the death.

501
00:24:25.486 --> 00:24:26.984
It could be a natural heart attack.

502
00:24:26.984 --> 00:24:30.726
It could be a robbery, as in the case of Mallove.

503
00:24:31.706 --> 00:24:33.381
He was robbed.

504
00:24:33.381 --> 00:24:36.359
Or it could be an apparent suicide without a note.

505
00:24:36.359 --> 00:24:38.462
<v Voiceover>Yes, suiciding people.</v>

506
00:24:38.462 --> 00:24:43.269
<v ->So, there are actually literally dozens of these cases</v>

507
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:47.279
of people that have been violently murdered

508
00:24:47.279 --> 00:24:50.618
or threatened or assaulted.

509
00:24:51.547 --> 00:24:54.992
And so, that's one very big reason

510
00:24:54.992 --> 00:24:58.458
why these technologies have never seen the light of day.

511
00:24:58.458 --> 00:24:59.894
<v Voiceover>And we know others personally</v>

512
00:24:59.894 --> 00:25:00.951
who have been threatened.

513
00:25:00.951 --> 00:25:02.900
They've had their laboratories broken into.

514
00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.802
They've had their devices stolen, smashed.

515
00:25:05.802 --> 00:25:09.539
I mean, I've heard a lot of these stories myself,

516
00:25:09.539 --> 00:25:12.573
and I'm not nearly as deeply involved as what you have been.

517
00:25:12.573 --> 00:25:16.600
So, you've been exposed to a lot of ugly stuff.

518
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.210
Another one that was just heart-raking.

519
00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:21.927
In fact, I remember reading the articles

520
00:25:21.927 --> 00:25:26.080
that had come out after Penn and what

521
00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.683
is the other, his partner's name?

522
00:25:27.683 --> 00:25:29.823
The other one, the two fellas in Utah.

523
00:25:29.823 --> 00:25:30.654
What are their names again?

524
00:25:30.654 --> 00:25:31.415
<v ->Oh, Pons and Fleischmann.</v>

525
00:25:31.415 --> 00:25:32.394
<v Voiceover>Pons and Fleischmann, yes.</v>

526
00:25:32.394 --> 00:25:34.451
I remember reading the articles coming out

527
00:25:34.451 --> 00:25:39.211
basically discrediting what they had done at the time.

528
00:25:39.211 --> 00:25:42.225
So, as a layperson, I just let it go.

529
00:25:42.225 --> 00:25:45.673
Oh well, I guess that was just a load of hot air.

530
00:25:45.673 --> 00:25:49.577
And this is the spinning in the public perception

531
00:25:49.577 --> 00:25:52.506
in someone who reads maybe a casual science magazine

532
00:25:52.506 --> 00:25:54.906
like myself, pretty much puts the end

533
00:25:54.906 --> 00:25:57.781
to any energetic demand or impetus around this.

534
00:25:57.781 --> 00:25:59.414
And this happens repeatedly.

535
00:25:59.414 --> 00:26:02.124
But, let's talk about something that was very exciting.

536
00:26:02.124 --> 00:26:06.358
A couple years ago, in fact we saw it on CNN,

537
00:26:06.358 --> 00:26:10.357
that inventor, again, met a horrible death

538
00:26:10.357 --> 00:26:14.302
as soon as the buzz started around his technology,

539
00:26:14.302 --> 00:26:15.834
and this is was Stanley Meyer.

540
00:26:15.834 --> 00:26:17.800
<v ->Yes, yes.
<v Voiceover>He talked about</v>

541
00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.560
his technology and what happened to him?

542
00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:23.427
<v ->Well, this is a man who had a device</v>

543
00:26:23.427 --> 00:26:26.811
that basically, where you could

544
00:26:26.811 --> 00:26:28.618
run your car in water

545
00:26:28.618 --> 00:26:31.284
and drive it over long distances.

546
00:26:31.284 --> 00:26:34.091
And the kinds of technologies here,

547
00:26:34.091 --> 00:26:36.057
and by the way, they're out there.

548
00:26:36.057 --> 00:26:39.193
They're fairly prevalent, is that you can

549
00:26:39.193 --> 00:26:42.296
manipulate the water molecule in such a way

550
00:26:42.296 --> 00:26:44.966
that you can electroyze the water.

551
00:26:44.966 --> 00:26:48.196
You can divide it into oxygen and hydrogen

552
00:26:48.196 --> 00:26:53.031
much less energetically than the normal electrolysis

553
00:26:53.031 --> 00:26:55.338
of normal H2O.

554
00:26:55.338 --> 00:26:58.577
And in so doing, you get

555
00:26:58.577 --> 00:27:00.609
more energy out of the hydrogen

556
00:27:00.609 --> 00:27:05.432
that you create on demand, than you used it

557
00:27:05.432 --> 00:27:08.290
to electrolyze it in the first place.

558
00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:13.238
So, that is basically a concept of overunity.

559
00:27:14.124 --> 00:27:15.797
All you need is a little bit of water

560
00:27:15.797 --> 00:27:18.902
and you can run your car across the country.

561
00:27:18.902 --> 00:27:20.729
<v Voiceover>I mean, the world was really</v>

562
00:27:20.729 --> 00:27:22.397
getting buzzed about this one.

563
00:27:22.397 --> 00:27:25.273
He'd made is onto mainstream news even.

564
00:27:25.273 --> 00:27:26.804
Other people had been reading about it,

565
00:27:26.804 --> 00:27:29.610
but he pretty quickly, once he came out with this,

566
00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:31.175
he had made it onto mainstream news.

567
00:27:31.175 --> 00:27:35.309
I remember watching a report about him on CNN, right?

568
00:27:35.309 --> 00:27:38.351
And then, within two weeks, he was out of the picture.

569
00:27:38.351 --> 00:27:39.911
<v ->Right, right, yep.</v>

570
00:27:39.911 --> 00:27:42.148
Yeah, he was poisoned.

571
00:27:42.148 --> 00:27:43.455
<v Voiceover>At a restaurant.</v>

572
00:27:43.455 --> 00:27:46.594
<v ->Yes, that is the story, and it's one</v>

573
00:27:46.594 --> 00:27:49.238
of many, many sad stories.

574
00:27:49.238 --> 00:27:50.825
And you know--
<v Voiceover>What happened</v>

575
00:27:50.825 --> 00:27:51.730
to that technology?

576
00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:54.575
What happens when these inventors

577
00:27:54.575 --> 00:27:58.938
are killed or pushed aside or destroyed

578
00:27:58.938 --> 00:28:00.531
in one way or another, then what happens?

579
00:28:00.531 --> 00:28:02.839
<v ->Well, it's different in individual cases,</v>

580
00:28:02.839 --> 00:28:05.834
and in this case, I would say fortunately,

581
00:28:05.834 --> 00:28:07.412
there have been many people

582
00:28:07.412 --> 00:28:09.928
that have been working on these technologies

583
00:28:09.928 --> 00:28:11.380
all over the world.

584
00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:14.711
And sooner or later, it will get out there.

585
00:28:14.711 --> 00:28:19.094
But still, you see a given inventor

586
00:28:19.094 --> 00:28:22.226
who's very successful and can actually

587
00:28:22.226 --> 00:28:23.658
have a working prototype.

588
00:28:23.658 --> 00:28:25.528
Once you get to that stage,

589
00:28:25.528 --> 00:28:27.635
that's where it can become dangerous,

590
00:28:27.635 --> 00:28:29.928
and that's been true throughout the history

591
00:28:29.928 --> 00:28:34.736
of radical energy development

592
00:28:34.736 --> 00:28:36.842
or breakthrough clean energy development.

593
00:28:36.842 --> 00:28:38.072
<v Voiceover>And what is the fear</v>

594
00:28:38.072 --> 00:28:41.773
of those who essentially suppress

595
00:28:41.773 --> 00:28:43.734
or control our technologies.

596
00:28:43.734 --> 00:28:45.582
I mean, we know some of the motivations.

597
00:28:45.582 --> 00:28:48.516
We know, we can understand the greed factor, certainly.

598
00:28:48.516 --> 00:28:49.889
But, what else?

599
00:28:49.889 --> 00:28:51.820
It has to be more than that, right?

600
00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.561
<v ->Well, yes of course there's the greed factor,</v>

601
00:28:55.561 --> 00:28:58.500
and that's transparent.

602
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.930
The fact is that directly challenging

603
00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:05.406
this multi-trillion dollar economy and vested interest is,

604
00:29:05.406 --> 00:29:10.301
is in and of itself, a big threat from their perception.

605
00:29:11.161 --> 00:29:14.284
So, the people in control want to wring

606
00:29:14.284 --> 00:29:18.964
every gallon of oil out of the ground that they can,

607
00:29:19.588 --> 00:29:21.185
can get away with for as long as they

608
00:29:21.185 --> 00:29:23.182
can get away with it, to optimize

609
00:29:23.182 --> 00:29:28.156
their short-term profits per unit time.

610
00:29:28.156 --> 00:29:31.299
That's the kind of what I call a Lapis Pig factor.

611
00:29:31.299 --> 00:29:34.964
It's the optimization of capitalistic gain

612
00:29:34.964 --> 00:29:37.399
in a competitive environment.

613
00:29:37.399 --> 00:29:40.699
But, you're right, it is more than that.

614
00:29:40.699 --> 00:29:42.898
There are control elements.

615
00:29:42.898 --> 00:29:45.412
There are powers behind the throne.

616
00:29:45.412 --> 00:29:48.907
I think we're seeing many symptoms about this,

617
00:29:48.907 --> 00:29:51.278
not only in the area of energy development.

618
00:29:51.278 --> 00:29:55.524
We're seeing it in the military industrial complex,

619
00:29:55.524 --> 00:29:58.820
going to war, the whole financial crisis.

620
00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.498
The financial community and the greed

621
00:30:01.498 --> 00:30:03.292
that's going on there.

622
00:30:03.292 --> 00:30:06.974
It seems to be an ever-further consolidation

623
00:30:06.974 --> 00:30:11.007
of control in which the effects

624
00:30:11.007 --> 00:30:15.379
are as a ridiculous degree of unsustainablity

625
00:30:16.208 --> 00:30:19.508
whether it's the fighting of wars.

626
00:30:19.508 --> 00:30:21.212
Whether it's the implementation

627
00:30:21.212 --> 00:30:26.148
of Monsanto type agriculture

628
00:30:26.859 --> 00:30:30.157
or pharmaceutical overkill.

629
00:30:30.157 --> 00:30:32.594
In all of these areas, there is a great deal

630
00:30:32.594 --> 00:30:37.020
of control that's happening, consolidation of control.

631
00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.659
And this, of course, has happened throughout

632
00:30:38.659 --> 00:30:40.362
the history of the world.

633
00:30:40.362 --> 00:30:42.793
So, Western civilization, such as

634
00:30:42.793 --> 00:30:45.007
we know it now, is crumbing.

635
00:30:45.007 --> 00:30:46.442
It's falling apart.

636
00:30:46.442 --> 00:30:48.503
The empire is falling apart,

637
00:30:49.623 --> 00:30:52.278
but there is good news on the horizon,

638
00:30:52.278 --> 00:30:53.872
and that's the part--
<v Voiceover>There is,</v>

639
00:30:53.872 --> 00:30:57.089
and well, and we're going to spend the last part

640
00:30:57.089 --> 00:30:59.249
of the interview talking about nothing but that.

641
00:30:59.249 --> 00:31:01.589
I just want to kind of still pick through

642
00:31:01.589 --> 00:31:02.847
a few of the little obstacles.

643
00:31:02.847 --> 00:31:04.455
You started, yourself, having encounters

644
00:31:04.455 --> 00:31:06.423
with the intelligence community.

645
00:31:06.423 --> 00:31:09.196
I think it was what 1987 when you

646
00:31:09.196 --> 00:31:11.115
started becoming involved in,

647
00:31:11.115 --> 00:31:13.124
well, it had another name prior to ISIS,

648
00:31:13.124 --> 00:31:15.005
but the Institute for Cooperation in Space

649
00:31:15.005 --> 00:31:17.639
and you were really positioning yourself

650
00:31:17.639 --> 00:31:20.537
against the Star Wars program,

651
00:31:20.537 --> 00:31:22.747
not only creating enemies on the ground,

652
00:31:22.747 --> 00:31:24.947
but let's create 'em in space too.

653
00:31:24.947 --> 00:31:25.980
What do ya think?

654
00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:28.082
Who gets that contract?

655
00:31:28.082 --> 00:31:29.782
<v ->Yeah, yeah, I know.</v>

656
00:31:29.782 --> 00:31:31.842
I've been kind of a thorn in the side

657
00:31:31.842 --> 00:31:34.556
of the military industrial complex.

658
00:31:34.556 --> 00:31:38.425
And I'm basically heeding Eisenhower's warning

659
00:31:38.425 --> 00:31:41.998
when he left office that the military industrial complex

660
00:31:41.998 --> 00:31:44.933
is becoming so powerful, there's very little

661
00:31:44.933 --> 00:31:45.961
you can do about.

662
00:31:45.961 --> 00:31:50.297
It's basically heralding the end of democracy as we know it.

663
00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:55.075
It's consolidating ever-increasing military force,

664
00:31:55.075 --> 00:31:58.975
military power, and lucrative contracts.

665
00:31:58.975 --> 00:32:00.816
And now, of course in the US,

666
00:32:00.816 --> 00:32:04.248
the military budget is higher than it's ever been,

667
00:32:04.248 --> 00:32:08.650
even higher than World War II, adjusted for inflation.

668
00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:13.515
And yet, the people of the US

669
00:32:13.515 --> 00:32:16.293
don't have a chance to speak out about that.

670
00:32:16.293 --> 00:32:17.323
<v Voiceover>No, they have not.</v>

671
00:32:17.323 --> 00:32:18.928
And there have been a few brave souls.

672
00:32:18.928 --> 00:32:21.682
One of them, Congressman Dennis Kucinich,

673
00:32:21.682 --> 00:32:25.269
and I found that a rather interesting journey.

674
00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:27.104
And he's a very different kind of being.

675
00:32:27.104 --> 00:32:27.908
I have met him.

676
00:32:27.908 --> 00:32:30.310
I know you've met him and in fact,

677
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:34.410
I remember what occurred

678
00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:37.267
around his space-based weapons,

679
00:32:37.267 --> 00:32:40.386
the bill he tried to introduce regarding space-based,

680
00:32:40.386 --> 00:32:42.915
banning on space-based weapons.

681
00:32:42.915 --> 00:32:44.945
And the compromises and such that

682
00:32:44.945 --> 00:32:46.097
were occurring at that time.

683
00:32:46.097 --> 00:32:47.288
Again, like I said in the beginning,

684
00:32:47.288 --> 00:32:49.890
this is a complex and murky picture

685
00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:51.260
that we're talking about here.

686
00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:55.130
You had a conglomeration of individuals

687
00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:57.938
that were free energy advocates,

688
00:32:57.938 --> 00:33:00.906
anti-Star Wars advocates, everyone in the same room,

689
00:33:00.906 --> 00:33:03.743
and Kucinich was really trying to carry

690
00:33:03.743 --> 00:33:05.815
some of this forward.

691
00:33:05.815 --> 00:33:07.375
But the bill was compromised because

692
00:33:07.375 --> 00:33:10.449
he tagged on something regarding chemtrails.

693
00:33:10.449 --> 00:33:13.277
And I was there, actually, at his,

694
00:33:13.277 --> 00:33:15.441
right after he had removed that

695
00:33:15.441 --> 00:33:19.295
from the language of that bill.

696
00:33:19.295 --> 00:33:21.462
And it was when he announced his run

697
00:33:21.462 --> 00:33:23.195
for president the first time,

698
00:33:23.195 --> 00:33:25.492
that someone said, "Why did you do that?"

699
00:33:25.492 --> 00:33:28.138
And very practically and briefly he said,

700
00:33:28.138 --> 00:33:31.000
"Look, it's simple.

701
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.899
"I can't, I can't do it.

702
00:33:32.899 --> 00:33:35.680
"The whole thing goes down if I don't take that out."

703
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.376
I think the whole thing went down anyway, didn't it?

704
00:33:37.376 --> 00:33:39.745
But, the point is that's when I met you.

705
00:33:39.745 --> 00:33:42.748
You were in and around all of these things going on.

706
00:33:42.748 --> 00:33:45.588
What was happening at this very tenuous time

707
00:33:45.588 --> 00:33:48.238
when a few good souls really were

708
00:33:48.238 --> 00:33:50.360
trying to make some public inroads?

709
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.594
This was around 9/11, by the way.

710
00:33:52.594 --> 00:33:53.886
<v ->Yeah, I know.</v>

711
00:33:53.886 --> 00:33:57.228
There were a lot of things going on around that time,

712
00:33:57.228 --> 00:34:00.066
and I've done some work with Dennis

713
00:34:00.066 --> 00:34:02.061
and he's a very good man.

714
00:34:02.061 --> 00:34:03.447
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

715
00:34:05.167 --> 00:34:07.775
<v ->He had asked me to work with him in legislation</v>

716
00:34:07.775 --> 00:34:10.140
for the provision of research and development

717
00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:13.041
on new energy technologies.

718
00:34:13.041 --> 00:34:16.577
And so often, when something gets sabotaged,

719
00:34:16.577 --> 00:34:18.487
it's not necessarily sabotaged

720
00:34:18.487 --> 00:34:22.406
by the powers that be, the elitists.

721
00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:26.562
Sometimes, it's sabotaged just by the individuals

722
00:34:26.562 --> 00:34:30.045
who are allies and who

723
00:34:32.025 --> 00:34:33.663
don't know really what they're doing

724
00:34:33.663 --> 00:34:35.621
or how the system works.

725
00:34:35.621 --> 00:34:38.306
So, sometimes things get sabotaged

726
00:34:38.306 --> 00:34:41.566
just by the people with good intentions.

727
00:34:42.656 --> 00:34:44.139
So, it's a very complex thing.

728
00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:47.000
There are many gates you have to go through

729
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.620
in order to make something politically viable in the US.

730
00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:54.886
And I have found it very frustrating

731
00:34:54.886 --> 00:34:59.289
because the new energy research and development bill

732
00:34:59.289 --> 00:35:03.357
was basically killed as a result of the egos

733
00:35:03.357 --> 00:35:06.578
of some of the people that were promoting the bill.

734
00:35:07.498 --> 00:35:09.334
<v Voiceover>Now, isn't that amazing?</v>

735
00:35:09.334 --> 00:35:11.535
<v ->Yeah, yeah it's, so many people</v>

736
00:35:11.535 --> 00:35:13.375
are into their careers.

737
00:35:13.375 --> 00:35:16.834
And fortunately, at this very ripe old age of mine,

738
00:35:18.074 --> 00:35:20.118
all my work in these areas is voluntary,

739
00:35:20.118 --> 00:35:24.721
so I don't have any ox to gore or vested interest to defend

740
00:35:24.721 --> 00:35:26.871
or career to build.

741
00:35:26.871 --> 00:35:31.351
But, in Washington, appearances can become so important.

742
00:35:31.351 --> 00:35:35.190
And so, the political part of my career

743
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:37.419
has become a lot more global

744
00:35:37.419 --> 00:35:39.760
and a lot more focused on some

745
00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:44.267
of the issues that we face in South America and Ecuador.

746
00:35:44.267 --> 00:35:46.774
saving the rain forest so forth.

747
00:35:46.774 --> 00:35:49.744
Which I find a great deal more attractable now

748
00:35:49.744 --> 00:35:52.276
because the whole US political system,

749
00:35:52.276 --> 00:35:54.571
it seems like just about everybody,

750
00:35:54.571 --> 00:35:57.086
except for Kucinich, is bought out.

751
00:35:57.086 --> 00:35:58.987
<v Voiceover>And even he had that little plane ride</v>

752
00:35:58.987 --> 00:36:00.654
with Obama recently.
<v Brian>Obama, yes.</v>

753
00:36:00.654 --> 00:36:02.783
<v Voiceover>And that made my heart very sad.</v>

754
00:36:02.783 --> 00:36:04.578
I can't imagine what was said to him

755
00:36:04.578 --> 00:36:06.925
and what it took to make him buckle,

756
00:36:06.925 --> 00:36:08.387
but that was a sad day.

757
00:36:08.387 --> 00:36:11.597
<v ->It was a sad day, but you're probably</v>

758
00:36:11.597 --> 00:36:15.263
also aware that the pressures

759
00:36:15.263 --> 00:36:16.337
on these guys--

760
00:36:16.337 --> 00:36:17.988
<v Voiceover>Oh, no doubt.</v>
<v ->Absolutely enormous.</v>

761
00:36:17.988 --> 00:36:20.141
And they're like puppets.

762
00:36:22.811 --> 00:36:24.244
And you don't know what's really going on

763
00:36:24.244 --> 00:36:26.368
behind the scenes with Obama whether somebody

764
00:36:26.368 --> 00:36:27.949
is almost literally--
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

765
00:36:27.949 --> 00:36:29.186
<v ->Pointing a gun to his head</v>

766
00:36:29.186 --> 00:36:32.489
and saying, "Do this, do this, don't do this."

767
00:36:32.489 --> 00:36:36.315
I have a feeling that he has to walk a very narrow path

768
00:36:37.365 --> 00:36:38.352
or else he's out.
<v Voiceover>I believe</v>

769
00:36:38.352 --> 00:36:40.956
that's true, yeah, I believe that is true.

770
00:36:40.956 --> 00:36:42.156
<v ->And this has probably been true</v>

771
00:36:42.156 --> 00:36:46.471
since the time of JFK who did have the courage

772
00:36:47.421 --> 00:36:50.173
to stand up and go for some truths

773
00:36:50.173 --> 00:36:51.373
that were very painful.
<v Voiceover>Oh, they went</v>

774
00:36:51.373 --> 00:36:52.904
after the Federal Reserve.

775
00:36:52.904 --> 00:36:54.920
He really tried to create disclosure

776
00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.806
regarding military suppressed information

777
00:36:57.806 --> 00:36:59.115
regarding ET contact.

778
00:36:59.115 --> 00:37:00.067
He went for it.

779
00:37:00.067 --> 00:37:02.448
<v ->And he wanted to, in his words,</v>

780
00:37:02.448 --> 00:37:04.450
"splinter the CIA into a million pieces".

781
00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:05.283
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

782
00:37:05.283 --> 00:37:08.519
<v ->And that really got their dander up</v>

783
00:37:08.519 --> 00:37:10.925
and of course, they ended his life.

784
00:37:10.925 --> 00:37:12.223
<v Voiceover>So, it's been a dangerous place</v>

785
00:37:12.223 --> 00:37:14.419
for a president to be since those times.

786
00:37:14.419 --> 00:37:17.298
<v ->Yes, yes, and so the president</v>

787
00:37:17.298 --> 00:37:18.903
really has no power.

788
00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:20.536
The people have no power.

789
00:37:20.536 --> 00:37:22.902
Congress is bought out, and that's the kind

790
00:37:22.902 --> 00:37:25.053
of system we're dealing with here.

791
00:37:25.053 --> 00:37:26.941
<v Voiceover>And at the same time,</v>

792
00:37:26.941 --> 00:37:29.910
we have this incredible awakening

793
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:31.679
of mass consciousness occurring

794
00:37:31.679 --> 00:37:35.481
which really is exponentially growing by the minute.

795
00:37:35.481 --> 00:37:38.486
I mean, you can even see it, we can even see it

796
00:37:38.486 --> 00:37:40.675
just from the interaction of ourselves

797
00:37:40.675 --> 00:37:43.327
at Conscious Media Network and the public-at-large

798
00:37:43.327 --> 00:37:44.918
around the world.

799
00:37:44.918 --> 00:37:48.195
People are waking, they are smelling the coffee

800
00:37:48.195 --> 00:37:50.398
in that something is not right around here.

801
00:37:50.398 --> 00:37:52.888
So, that part, I think, most, not most

802
00:37:52.888 --> 00:37:54.995
but a good percentage of people have.

803
00:37:54.995 --> 00:37:57.742
But, now this next leap is

804
00:37:58.569 --> 00:38:02.910
creating the conscious community-at-large

805
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:06.849
that has essentially enough creative juice

806
00:38:06.849 --> 00:38:08.881
to be able to bring some of these things

807
00:38:08.881 --> 00:38:11.751
into reality, in spite of living

808
00:38:11.751 --> 00:38:14.258
within a fairly corrupt system,

809
00:38:14.258 --> 00:38:15.156
and that's globally.

810
00:38:15.156 --> 00:38:16.124
That's not just the US.

811
00:38:16.124 --> 00:38:17.351
That's globally.

812
00:38:17.351 --> 00:38:18.658
It might be a little more manageable

813
00:38:18.658 --> 00:38:21.030
in a smaller country, but the corruption

814
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:22.822
seems to be pervasive.

815
00:38:22.822 --> 00:38:23.700
Where's there's power,

816
00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.165
you have corruption.
<v Brian>Exactly.</v>

817
00:38:25.165 --> 00:38:27.299
<v Voiceover>So, how do you, 'cause you're also</v>

818
00:38:27.299 --> 00:38:29.936
very in your own heart, very much

819
00:38:29.936 --> 00:38:34.664
a very conscious and deeply spiritual being.

820
00:38:34.664 --> 00:38:37.941
And so, how do we bring about a spiritual transformation

821
00:38:37.941 --> 00:38:42.213
that can really bring in on its heels then

822
00:38:42.213 --> 00:38:46.351
these solutions to start soothing the woes

823
00:38:46.351 --> 00:38:48.680
of the planet environmentally?

824
00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:53.018
<v ->Well, first of all, obviously there's the recognition</v>

825
00:38:53.018 --> 00:38:55.150
that the path we're going on,

826
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:57.725
if we keep going in the direction we're going.

827
00:38:57.725 --> 00:39:00.929
And if we don't manage

828
00:39:00.929 --> 00:39:03.873
to relieve the oppression

829
00:39:03.873 --> 00:39:08.820
that's now happening, then we're not gonna make it.

830
00:39:09.609 --> 00:39:11.381
I really believe that.

831
00:39:11.381 --> 00:39:16.341
One can only project into the future the path

832
00:39:16.341 --> 00:39:20.288
that we're now taking and how it's just not gonna work.

833
00:39:20.288 --> 00:39:21.144
That's the bad news.

834
00:39:21.144 --> 00:39:22.891
The good news is that more and more people

835
00:39:22.891 --> 00:39:24.780
are awakening.

836
00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.419
There is a nonlinear effect there.

837
00:39:27.419 --> 00:39:29.631
There are experiments in consciousness

838
00:39:29.631 --> 00:39:34.608
and this was really my path during the 1980s into the '90s.

839
00:39:37.281 --> 00:39:40.376
It was a time of intense metaphysical exploration,

840
00:39:40.376 --> 00:39:42.970
but also scientific exploration

841
00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:47.007
of questions that had been forbidden to be asked

842
00:39:47.007 --> 00:39:49.472
in Western science that lie outside

843
00:39:49.472 --> 00:39:51.109
of the box of Western science,

844
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:53.652
but nevertheless, are very real.

845
00:39:53.652 --> 00:39:54.921
And some of the experiments

846
00:39:54.921 --> 00:39:58.884
that were first done at Princeton in the laboratories,

847
00:39:58.884 --> 00:40:03.439
the PEAR labs of Robert Jahn and then later Dean Radin,

848
00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:08.025
show that these random event generators

849
00:40:08.025 --> 00:40:12.206
cohere in a nonlinear way when people

850
00:40:12.206 --> 00:40:15.868
such as bonded couples and then larger groups

851
00:40:15.868 --> 00:40:18.209
combine in positive human intention.

852
00:40:18.209 --> 00:40:21.866
They can literally change the material of the world.

853
00:40:21.866 --> 00:40:24.643
And so, the awakening in consciousness

854
00:40:24.643 --> 00:40:27.687
which has been divided and ruled

855
00:40:27.687 --> 00:40:31.458
up until relatively recently, is beginning

856
00:40:31.458 --> 00:40:32.563
to get traction.

857
00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:33.827
I do believe that.

858
00:40:33.827 --> 00:40:37.782
Now, people have talked about this 20 years ago,

859
00:40:38.999 --> 00:40:41.268
but then it was just talk.

860
00:40:41.268 --> 00:40:43.307
Now, I am quite a bit more encouraged,

861
00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:45.036
just like you are.

862
00:40:45.036 --> 00:40:47.174
And I don't know what it is.

863
00:40:47.174 --> 00:40:50.513
It's just some sort of new energy

864
00:40:50.513 --> 00:40:53.072
that has come into me to be able

865
00:40:53.072 --> 00:40:56.550
to, let's say, take this trip, come back to the US,

866
00:40:56.550 --> 00:41:00.387
not feel the fears that I felt.

867
00:41:00.387 --> 00:41:03.959
Maybe even an element of paranoia thrown in.

868
00:41:03.959 --> 00:41:06.191
That that's now lifting.

869
00:41:06.191 --> 00:41:07.188
The cloud is lifting.

870
00:41:07.188 --> 00:41:09.553
The people are getting more friendly.

871
00:41:10.963 --> 00:41:13.112
And those of us that have been

872
00:41:13.112 --> 00:41:15.703
in this movement for a long, long time,

873
00:41:15.703 --> 00:41:18.136
I think are beginning to see the light.

874
00:41:18.136 --> 00:41:21.374
<v Voiceover>And you were, just to backtrack a few seconds.</v>

875
00:41:21.374 --> 00:41:24.214
You hadn't been back to the states for a few years.

876
00:41:24.214 --> 00:41:28.125
You've had your experiences

877
00:41:28.125 --> 00:41:30.877
along the way having to interface, like it or not,

878
00:41:30.877 --> 00:41:34.132
with the intelligence communities and so forth.

879
00:41:35.022 --> 00:41:36.812
What you do is a matter of public record,

880
00:41:36.812 --> 00:41:40.056
and has been perceived as a threat at times

881
00:41:40.056 --> 00:41:41.357
to the vested interests.

882
00:41:41.357 --> 00:41:43.928
So, you're coming back into the country,

883
00:41:43.928 --> 00:41:46.641
not surprisingly, with a little trepidation.

884
00:41:47.437 --> 00:41:48.729
<v ->Well, that's true.</v>

885
00:41:48.729 --> 00:41:51.899
The last time I was here, I saw you in Mount Shasta.

886
00:41:51.899 --> 00:41:55.172
That was about three years ago, maybe four years ago.

887
00:41:55.172 --> 00:42:00.042
And I do see a lightening of energy.

888
00:42:00.042 --> 00:42:02.485
I am sensitive to energies.

889
00:42:02.485 --> 00:42:05.412
And on the one hand, I do see a lot

890
00:42:05.412 --> 00:42:07.452
of people that are dumbing down

891
00:42:07.452 --> 00:42:08.938
and kind of obese

892
00:42:08.938 --> 00:42:13.403
and into consumerism and stuff. (laughs)

893
00:42:14.177 --> 00:42:15.888
But, I also see a lot of people

894
00:42:15.888 --> 00:42:18.958
that are awakening.

895
00:42:18.958 --> 00:42:22.561
It is a very dramatic unfoldment.

896
00:42:22.561 --> 00:42:23.595
<v Voiceover>Well, I wanted you to share it</v>

897
00:42:23.595 --> 00:42:25.074
because for that reason.

898
00:42:25.074 --> 00:42:26.901
It's nice sometimes to get a reflection

899
00:42:26.901 --> 00:42:30.377
when you've been away, and have it reflected back at us.

900
00:42:30.377 --> 00:42:31.767
I thought maybe you would have felt

901
00:42:31.767 --> 00:42:34.740
overwhelmed, you know, with an oppressive energy.

902
00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.010
I didn't know what you would find

903
00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:37.266
when you came back here.

904
00:42:37.266 --> 00:42:40.018
But, such was not the case even at the airport.

905
00:42:40.018 --> 00:42:40.983
<v ->That's right.</v>

906
00:42:40.983 --> 00:42:42.822
Yeah, coming in was a really friendly guy

907
00:42:42.822 --> 00:42:45.083
at Homeland Security

908
00:42:45.083 --> 00:42:48.287
You know, I have to acknowledge that,

909
00:42:48.287 --> 00:42:51.561
that all kinds of people.

910
00:42:51.561 --> 00:42:53.226
I've see my family.

911
00:42:53.226 --> 00:42:56.473
It was a very pleasant, compassionate visit

912
00:42:56.473 --> 00:42:59.938
even though we may not agree politically,

913
00:42:59.938 --> 00:43:02.664
or how to go about doing things.

914
00:43:02.664 --> 00:43:05.146
There was a lot of well-wishing.

915
00:43:05.146 --> 00:43:07.789
And really it's an energetic thing.

916
00:43:07.789 --> 00:43:10.181
I tend to be a very sensitive person,

917
00:43:10.181 --> 00:43:12.378
so I can kind of read energies

918
00:43:12.378 --> 00:43:15.882
and I can see that people,

919
00:43:15.882 --> 00:43:17.491
not only want to change,

920
00:43:17.491 --> 00:43:20.253
but they're feeling more compassionate.

921
00:43:20.253 --> 00:43:23.129
They're feeling more love than they have before.

922
00:43:23.129 --> 00:43:23.967
<v Voiceover>So, there's a new kind</v>

923
00:43:23.967 --> 00:43:26.025
of wind under our wings collectively

924
00:43:26.025 --> 00:43:29.305
that's occurring here, and that we're generating together.

925
00:43:29.305 --> 00:43:31.235
So, on very practical level,

926
00:43:31.235 --> 00:43:33.076
we have to, it always has to come back down

927
00:43:33.076 --> 00:43:36.877
to awareness which starts with some education.

928
00:43:36.877 --> 00:43:37.913
<v ->Absolutely.
<v Voiceover>How do we begin</v>

929
00:43:37.913 --> 00:43:40.484
educating ourselves as to what that potentials are?

930
00:43:40.484 --> 00:43:43.916
How do we, as the masses, know what

931
00:43:43.916 --> 00:43:45.561
to put our support behind even

932
00:43:45.561 --> 00:43:46.706
when most of this information

933
00:43:46.706 --> 00:43:48.179
is relatively suppressed anyway?

934
00:43:48.179 --> 00:43:49.175
You can go on YouTube.

935
00:43:49.175 --> 00:43:49.857
You can find it.

936
00:43:49.857 --> 00:43:51.559
You can go on your site and find it.

937
00:43:51.559 --> 00:43:53.429
So, how do we begin this process

938
00:43:53.429 --> 00:43:56.524
of education so we know who to let go of

939
00:43:56.524 --> 00:43:59.265
and who to support from this point forward?

940
00:43:59.265 --> 00:44:02.431
<v ->Well, I think it's up to the individual.</v>

941
00:44:02.431 --> 00:44:06.065
It's up to all of us to take the responsibility

942
00:44:06.065 --> 00:44:08.303
of finding out what's possible.

943
00:44:08.303 --> 00:44:12.837
What kind of future do you want for us to have?

944
00:44:13.837 --> 00:44:16.118
For example, the free energy technologies.

945
00:44:16.118 --> 00:44:18.783
Yes, that would probably constitute

946
00:44:18.783 --> 00:44:21.512
the biggest revolution in the history of the world.

947
00:44:21.512 --> 00:44:23.287
And immediately followed

948
00:44:23.287 --> 00:44:26.685
by the new science of consciousness

949
00:44:26.685 --> 00:44:30.162
which will allow us to raise our consciousness

950
00:44:30.162 --> 00:44:33.299
which has to be a concombinant process

951
00:44:33.299 --> 00:44:36.667
with the implementation of the new energy.

952
00:44:36.667 --> 00:44:39.241
Because we have to be responsible

953
00:44:39.241 --> 00:44:41.633
for implementing these new technologies.

954
00:44:41.633 --> 00:44:43.940
We can't screw up again.

955
00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:47.545
We can't go the way of nuclear power, for example,

956
00:44:47.545 --> 00:44:51.019
which most of us know would be disasterous

957
00:44:51.019 --> 00:44:54.713
if we were to have a nuclear power society

958
00:44:54.713 --> 00:44:57.991
because of the long-live radioactive waste.

959
00:44:57.991 --> 00:45:00.126
<v Voiceover>Yes, we've seen evidence</v>

960
00:45:00.126 --> 00:45:01.426
of what that brings, yes.
<v Brian>The dangerous</v>

961
00:45:01.426 --> 00:45:04.666
technology, the safety of the power plants and so forth.

962
00:45:04.666 --> 00:45:09.021
So, we have to now embrace

963
00:45:09.021 --> 00:45:13.439
the possibility that we could have totally clean energy.

964
00:45:13.439 --> 00:45:16.865
You could have a 10 kilowatt power pack

965
00:45:16.865 --> 00:45:19.008
you could fit in the palm of your hand

966
00:45:19.008 --> 00:45:21.108
and stick it in your circuit breaker box

967
00:45:21.108 --> 00:45:23.373
or put it under the hood of your car.

968
00:45:23.373 --> 00:45:26.055
Or which could be implemented worldwide

969
00:45:26.055 --> 00:45:30.223
to relieve poverty and to be able to

970
00:45:30.223 --> 00:45:33.355
for example, desalinate and purify water.

971
00:45:33.355 --> 00:45:37.397
You can do all kinds of things with this technology,

972
00:45:37.397 --> 00:45:39.567
but you can also abuse it.

973
00:45:39.567 --> 00:45:41.064
And so, you don't want Dick Cheney

974
00:45:41.064 --> 00:45:44.036
running this one again.
<v Voiceover>No, (laughs) no.</v>

975
00:45:44.036 --> 00:45:47.632
<v ->And so, the problems are more social and political</v>

976
00:45:47.632 --> 00:45:50.302
than they are technical.
<v Voiceover>Practical</v>

977
00:45:50.302 --> 00:45:51.243
and technical, yes.

978
00:45:51.243 --> 00:45:55.510
<v ->Yeah, the technical, I'm convinced</v>

979
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:59.452
the technology is there.
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

980
00:46:00.762 --> 00:46:04.026
<v ->But, the people that do the technology</v>

981
00:46:04.026 --> 00:46:06.083
need to be protected.

982
00:46:06.083 --> 00:46:08.190
They need to be able to be allowed

983
00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:12.418
to do their research and development and supported.

984
00:46:12.418 --> 00:46:17.035
But, right along with that, we need responsible government,

985
00:46:17.035 --> 00:46:21.062
and we don't need economic selfishness anymore.

986
00:46:22.212 --> 00:46:23.643
We don't want somebody to become

987
00:46:23.643 --> 00:46:25.139
the Bill Gates of new energy

988
00:46:25.139 --> 00:46:28.799
and then control the technology.

989
00:46:29.947 --> 00:46:32.151
I think the whole thing ought to be open source.

990
00:46:32.151 --> 00:46:33.109
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

991
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:36.622
<v ->Just put out there for the benefit of everybody.</v>

992
00:46:36.622 --> 00:46:39.827
But, at the same time, I also realize

993
00:46:39.827 --> 00:46:43.731
that we have, it's Prometheus

994
00:46:43.731 --> 00:46:47.495
playing with fire that the human civilization has

995
00:46:47.495 --> 00:46:50.801
to raise its consciousness enough

996
00:46:50.801 --> 00:46:54.564
so that these technologies and the ones to follow

997
00:46:54.564 --> 00:46:57.257
could be responsibly implemented.

998
00:46:57.257 --> 00:47:00.179
<v Voiceover>So, there is no separating consciousness</v>

999
00:47:00.179 --> 00:47:03.052
from our future technologies any longer.

1000
00:47:03.052 --> 00:47:03.968
<v ->There isn't.</v>

1001
00:47:03.968 --> 00:47:07.075
And of course, the new science and technology

1002
00:47:07.075 --> 00:47:11.353
of consciousness is totally different

1003
00:47:11.353 --> 00:47:15.602
from the older science of reductionism, materialism.

1004
00:47:16.832 --> 00:47:20.315
This is where we can, through our intention,

1005
00:47:21.465 --> 00:47:24.293
literally transform the material world.

1006
00:47:24.293 --> 00:47:26.199
We can create energy.

1007
00:47:26.199 --> 00:47:28.474
We can create matter.

1008
00:47:28.474 --> 00:47:30.839
We're very powerful creators,

1009
00:47:30.839 --> 00:47:34.336
but when I use the word we,

1010
00:47:34.336 --> 00:47:36.367
I mean all of humanity.

1011
00:47:37.208 --> 00:47:41.857
We can't afford anymore to have people

1012
00:47:41.857 --> 00:47:45.556
try to consolidate their power evermore

1013
00:47:45.556 --> 00:47:47.985
and control us.
<v Voiceover>Yes,</v>

1014
00:47:47.985 --> 00:47:52.197
decentralization is critical in terms of energy now.

1015
00:47:52.197 --> 00:47:54.284
<v ->Exactly.
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1016
00:47:54.284 --> 00:47:56.669
And so, we're talking about, in the end,

1017
00:47:56.669 --> 00:47:59.176
and it seems like it doesn't really matter

1018
00:47:59.176 --> 00:48:02.798
what the subject is or who I'm talking with anymore,

1019
00:48:02.798 --> 00:48:04.276
it's really simple.

1020
00:48:04.276 --> 00:48:07.111
We need to get out of the fear model

1021
00:48:07.111 --> 00:48:09.486
and the pointing fingers model and the they model,

1022
00:48:09.486 --> 00:48:14.045
into taking our power back in every sense of the word.

1023
00:48:14.045 --> 00:48:18.856
And as you say, taking the power back gently.

1024
00:48:18.856 --> 00:48:21.995
Moving forward gently in this, what is a revolution

1025
00:48:21.995 --> 00:48:24.464
as your book states.

1026
00:48:24.464 --> 00:48:26.894
This is revolution, but we can't do it

1027
00:48:26.894 --> 00:48:30.265
in the old way of revolution.
<v Brian>No, no.</v>

1028
00:48:30.265 --> 00:48:33.041
And so, that's the daunting task

1029
00:48:33.041 --> 00:48:38.037
that's before us which is that we need a revolution,

1030
00:48:38.037 --> 00:48:42.359
but the revolution should be non-violent,

1031
00:48:43.248 --> 00:48:46.939
and it needs to be for the benefit of everybody.

1032
00:48:48.013 --> 00:48:51.150
And humanity has never done this before,

1033
00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:55.455
but the good news again is that

1034
00:48:55.455 --> 00:48:59.100
the phenomena of consciousness, of oneness,

1035
00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:02.802
of our interconnectivity, of love and compassion

1036
00:49:02.802 --> 00:49:06.907
for all creation, of the mandate

1037
00:49:06.907 --> 00:49:11.343
to be in balance with nature and one another

1038
00:49:11.343 --> 00:49:13.841
could never be clearer to more of us.

1039
00:49:14.727 --> 00:49:19.171
And getting beyond the rhetoric of change.

1040
00:49:20.055 --> 00:49:22.351
Now, we need a whole new rhetoric

1041
00:49:22.351 --> 00:49:25.656
and consummation of that which

1042
00:49:25.656 --> 00:49:27.188
is whole new social structures,

1043
00:49:27.188 --> 00:49:29.231
whole new government structures.

1044
00:49:29.231 --> 00:49:31.433
A relocalization effort.

1045
00:49:31.433 --> 00:49:33.856
And first and foremost,

1046
00:49:33.856 --> 00:49:36.521
peace, sustainability and justice.

1047
00:49:37.601 --> 00:49:40.353
These are high principles,

1048
00:49:40.353 --> 00:49:44.404
and they need to be developed as soon as possible.

1049
00:49:44.404 --> 00:49:47.410
<v Voiceover>We need to develop them individually,</v>

1050
00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:50.751
internally, so that we even begin to express

1051
00:49:50.751 --> 00:49:55.652
this in a larger sense.
<v Brian>Yes, yes, yeah,</v>

1052
00:49:55.652 --> 00:49:57.627
and that's a daunting task.

1053
00:49:57.627 --> 00:50:02.559
It's not take a lot of quote work

1054
00:50:02.559 --> 00:50:04.292
in terms of time consumption.

1055
00:50:04.292 --> 00:50:07.315
It has to take a whole new perspective,

1056
00:50:07.315 --> 00:50:11.390
a whole new change internally, each of us,

1057
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:15.640
to be responsible for our part in the whole picture.

1058
00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.278
<v Voiceover>And we are, in part, responsible</v>

1059
00:50:17.278 --> 00:50:19.647
for this by turning a blind eye,

1060
00:50:19.647 --> 00:50:22.052
by not choosing to know more,

1061
00:50:22.052 --> 00:50:25.614
by not following up on a titillating page 14 article

1062
00:50:25.614 --> 00:50:28.111
about some new breakthrough.

1063
00:50:28.111 --> 00:50:29.515
That's on us.

1064
00:50:29.515 --> 00:50:32.074
We're not demanding any better of the situation.

1065
00:50:32.074 --> 00:50:32.921
We have not been

1066
00:50:32.921 --> 00:50:34.763
demanding any better.
<v Brian>That's right.</v>

1067
00:50:34.763 --> 00:50:36.697
Yeah, we've allowed, you know,

1068
00:50:36.697 --> 00:50:39.259
when I talk about the suppression of a new energy

1069
00:50:39.259 --> 00:50:42.971
or any kind of new

1070
00:50:42.971 --> 00:50:45.263
breakthrough situation,

1071
00:50:45.263 --> 00:50:48.970
I list a lot of factors.

1072
00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:51.282
The scientists are doing the suppressing.

1073
00:50:51.282 --> 00:50:52.746
Environmentalists, people that call

1074
00:50:52.746 --> 00:50:55.800
themselves environmentalists, they are too.

1075
00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:59.045
They're not really embracing the solutions.

1076
00:50:59.045 --> 00:51:01.294
They're great at stating the problems.

1077
00:51:02.088 --> 00:51:04.380
<v Voiceover>Activism often focuses more</v>

1078
00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:05.828
on the problem than the solution

1079
00:51:05.828 --> 00:51:06.927
is an issue, yeah.
<v Brian>Exactly.</v>

1080
00:51:06.927 --> 00:51:09.663
Yeah, and so, scientists, environmentalists,

1081
00:51:09.663 --> 00:51:11.658
the progressives.

1082
00:51:11.658 --> 00:51:13.829
I know a lot of wonderful progressive people,

1083
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:17.203
and boy do they, is their critique articulate.

1084
00:51:17.203 --> 00:51:20.432
But, they don't really understand the solutions.

1085
00:51:20.432 --> 00:51:22.470
They don't get to the solutions.

1086
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:24.242
They don't, even some of them,

1087
00:51:24.242 --> 00:51:27.817
the brighter of them, friends of mine,

1088
00:51:27.817 --> 00:51:30.407
can't really see beyond that.

1089
00:51:30.407 --> 00:51:31.939
Or they're maybe afraid.

1090
00:51:31.939 --> 00:51:34.445
There is this unconscious fear

1091
00:51:34.445 --> 00:51:36.619
of embracing the possibility.

1092
00:51:36.619 --> 00:51:39.894
I'd like to, as part of the educational process,

1093
00:51:39.894 --> 00:51:41.857
I'd like to stimulate debate.

1094
00:51:41.857 --> 00:51:45.397
I'd like to talk with people that would prefer

1095
00:51:45.397 --> 00:51:49.129
not to see new energy happen.

1096
00:51:50.369 --> 00:51:53.239
You know, for maybe very good reasons

1097
00:51:53.239 --> 00:51:57.529
like bigger power saws, people with personal helicopters.

1098
00:51:58.376 --> 00:52:01.683
You know, and bigger weapons.

1099
00:52:01.683 --> 00:52:04.053
All of those things could happen,

1100
00:52:04.053 --> 00:52:05.850
and so this requires a level

1101
00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:08.380
of personal and collective integrity

1102
00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.345
that has never happened before.

1103
00:52:10.345 --> 00:52:12.358
<v Voiceover>But, I like you have faith.</v>

1104
00:52:12.358 --> 00:52:14.896
I have faith that something, there is something new.

1105
00:52:14.896 --> 00:52:15.928
I can feel it.

1106
00:52:15.928 --> 00:52:18.711
There is a rejuvenation that's occurring

1107
00:52:18.711 --> 00:52:22.135
on almost a cellular level that I think

1108
00:52:22.135 --> 00:52:24.072
is going to carry us forward into this.

1109
00:52:24.072 --> 00:52:26.275
There's no doubt it's going to go this way, in my mind.

1110
00:52:26.275 --> 00:52:27.067
No doubt.

1111
00:52:27.067 --> 00:52:29.567
It's just a matter of how soon?

1112
00:52:29.567 --> 00:52:31.821
And how chaotic or bumpy the ride might get

1113
00:52:31.821 --> 00:52:32.870
between here and there?

1114
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:34.737
But, we will end up there.

1115
00:52:34.737 --> 00:52:35.971
<v ->Well, we need all the help</v>

1116
00:52:35.971 --> 00:52:37.313
<v ->we can get.
<v Voiceover>We do, we do.</v>

1117
00:52:37.313 --> 00:52:38.917
<v ->And we are getting help.</v>

1118
00:52:38.917 --> 00:52:40.789
I think we're getting help from off-planet.

1119
00:52:40.789 --> 00:52:42.513
<v Voiceover>I believe it.</v>

1120
00:52:42.513 --> 00:52:45.737
<v ->And I think we also can ask for the help.</v>

1121
00:52:46.612 --> 00:52:48.185
We need to be willing to receive it.

1122
00:52:48.185 --> 00:52:52.317
We need to get away from this consciousness

1123
00:52:52.317 --> 00:52:55.662
of dumbing down and allowing

1124
00:52:55.662 --> 00:52:57.965
the negativity to unfold,

1125
00:52:57.965 --> 00:53:00.677
and take the lead.

1126
00:53:00.677 --> 00:53:03.642
And bring as many people with us

1127
00:53:03.642 --> 00:53:06.607
as we can, especially younger people.

1128
00:53:06.607 --> 00:53:09.350
So, that's why the education is so important

1129
00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:11.520
because I'm not gonna be on this planet

1130
00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:14.951
a whole lot longer, unless of course I am.

1131
00:53:14.951 --> 00:53:17.657
<v Voiceover>(laughs) Unless you are.</v>

1132
00:53:17.657 --> 00:53:20.473
<v ->And so, it's their--
<v Voiceover>They need</v>

1133
00:53:20.473 --> 00:53:21.941
to pick it up now.
<v Brian>Their heritage.</v>

1134
00:53:21.941 --> 00:53:23.490
<v Voiceover>Pick it up with the new consciousness</v>

1135
00:53:23.490 --> 00:53:25.565
that they're already moving into and possess.

1136
00:53:27.095 --> 00:53:29.733
Now, for you, you're going back Vilcabamba

1137
00:53:29.733 --> 00:53:33.610
before too long, and your beautiful home Monte Suenos?

1138
00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:35.678
<v ->Monte Suenos, mountain dreams.</v>

1139
00:53:35.678 --> 00:53:38.874
<v Voiceover>Monte Suenos in Vilcabamba, Ecuador.</v>

1140
00:53:38.874 --> 00:53:41.078
And you've seen that country through a lot

1141
00:53:41.078 --> 00:53:42.738
of change as well.

1142
00:53:42.738 --> 00:53:44.081
You've seen what's happened,

1143
00:53:44.081 --> 00:53:45.947
well in more recent times anyway.

1144
00:53:45.947 --> 00:53:49.588
And so, it's a little scaled down a little bit smaller,

1145
00:53:49.588 --> 00:53:51.321
a little more manageable and change happens

1146
00:53:51.321 --> 00:53:52.845
a little more quickly.

1147
00:53:52.845 --> 00:53:55.826
Are you learning a fair amount from the experience

1148
00:53:55.826 --> 00:53:57.856
of living outside the US and experience it?

1149
00:53:57.856 --> 00:54:01.022
<v ->Oh yes, we love it there because we,</v>

1150
00:54:01.022 --> 00:54:03.800
well first of all, we're retirement age.

1151
00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.888
We wanted affordable retirement.

1152
00:54:05.888 --> 00:54:07.732
We wanted to get out of the kind

1153
00:54:07.732 --> 00:54:09.698
of stressful environment.

1154
00:54:09.698 --> 00:54:12.069
And it's very unstressful there.

1155
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:13.693
We're up in the Andes.

1156
00:54:13.693 --> 00:54:17.513
The weather's perfect and Meredith and I

1157
00:54:17.513 --> 00:54:21.643
quite unexpectedly created an eco-retreat conference center

1158
00:54:21.643 --> 00:54:25.919
and B and B service, which we're very gladly

1159
00:54:25.919 --> 00:54:29.650
as Ma and Pa, conducting these days,

1160
00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:31.557
kind of in a low-keyed way.

1161
00:54:31.557 --> 00:54:35.068
And people love it because it's really

1162
00:54:35.068 --> 00:54:37.103
getting away from it all
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1163
00:54:37.103 --> 00:54:39.940
<v ->And yet, we still are tuned into the internet.</v>

1164
00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:42.273
We can take nature hikes.

1165
00:54:42.273 --> 00:54:45.878
The scenery is fantastic.

1166
00:54:45.878 --> 00:54:48.935
The air is clean, no chemtrails,

1167
00:54:48.935 --> 00:54:51.946
and you know, as soon as I get there,

1168
00:54:51.946 --> 00:54:54.820
I wonder, my gosh, I went to all these cities.

1169
00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:57.391
I went on this tour and now I'm back.

1170
00:54:57.391 --> 00:55:01.196
It's sort of like two lifetimes that are so separate.

1171
00:55:01.196 --> 00:55:04.052
But, there is magic going on there.

1172
00:55:04.052 --> 00:55:07.595
That's the good news that in consciousness,

1173
00:55:07.595 --> 00:55:10.290
we know that what we've been able

1174
00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:14.867
to do to create this place is right on target

1175
00:55:14.867 --> 00:55:18.246
because the universe is cooperating with us in ways that we

1176
00:55:18.246 --> 00:55:20.602
have never, never felt before.
<v Voiceover>So, you're in</v>

1177
00:55:20.602 --> 00:55:21.415
the right place.

1178
00:55:21.415 --> 00:55:23.479
My son was there and met you there

1179
00:55:23.479 --> 00:55:26.453
a few years ago and reported back

1180
00:55:26.453 --> 00:55:29.300
that it was just a splendid energy.

1181
00:55:30.687 --> 00:55:32.425
<v ->And that was, and he visited before</v>

1182
00:55:32.425 --> 00:55:34.792
we even created the place.
<v Voiceover>That's right.</v>

1183
00:55:34.792 --> 00:55:38.867
<v ->Our place now is kind of magnificent,</v>

1184
00:55:38.867 --> 00:55:42.829
artistic environment on a mountainside

1185
00:55:42.829 --> 00:55:44.368
in a lush tropical garden.

1186
00:55:44.368 --> 00:55:45.601
<v Voiceover>Ah, to dream.</v>

1187
00:55:45.601 --> 00:55:48.003
OK, so one day I'm hoping that Scott and I

1188
00:55:48.003 --> 00:55:50.408
can make our way down and just chill out

1189
00:55:50.408 --> 00:55:53.811
and have some enlivening creative discussion

1190
00:55:53.811 --> 00:55:54.882
along the way as well.

1191
00:55:54.882 --> 00:55:56.245
We'll see how that works out.

1192
00:55:56.245 --> 00:55:58.345
<v ->Yeah, yeah, well you're warmly welcome.</v>

1193
00:55:58.345 --> 00:56:00.186
<v ->Thank you and thank you for spending time</v>

1194
00:56:00.186 --> 00:56:01.103
with us today.

1195
00:56:01.103 --> 00:56:02.391
I really appreciate it, Brian.

1196
00:56:02.391 --> 00:56:03.386
<v ->My pleasure.</v>

1197
00:56:03.386 --> 00:56:05.301
(flowing instrumental music)

1198
00:56:05.301 --> 00:56:07.407
<v ->For a more detailed account of Brian's journey</v>

1199
00:56:07.407 --> 00:56:09.518
in this world and his call to action,

1200
00:56:09.518 --> 00:56:12.468
you can buy his book The Energy Solution Revolution

1201
00:56:12.468 --> 00:56:14.559
at Amazon and other book sellers.

1202
00:56:14.559 --> 00:56:16.750
To dig deeper, you'll find a treasure trove

1203
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:19.212
of information and links on his website

1204
00:56:19.212 --> 00:56:21.008
at brianoleary.com.

1205
00:56:21.008 --> 00:56:22.575
For another interview on the topic

1206
00:56:22.575 --> 00:56:24.588
of alternative technologies, you might also

1207
00:56:24.588 --> 00:56:27.178
be interested in our interview with Tom Valone.

1208
00:56:27.178 --> 00:56:30.033
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
