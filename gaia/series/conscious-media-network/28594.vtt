00:00:00.556 --> 00:00:03.158
<v ->Dr. Lee Lipsenthal has dedicated his career</v>

2
00:00:03.158 --> 00:00:05.462
to assisting other doctors and nurses

3
00:00:05.462 --> 00:00:08.860
to find their sanity in the insane world of medicine.

4
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.207
With the strong belief that the majority of doctors

5
00:00:11.207 --> 00:00:13.617
enter the field for altruistic reasons,

6
00:00:13.617 --> 00:00:15.580
he says the odds start stacking up

7
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.543
against their happiness and well-being

8
00:00:17.543 --> 00:00:20.225
by the time they graduate from medical school.

9
00:00:22.748 --> 00:00:27.748
(gentle music)

10
00:00:29.372 --> 00:00:31.100
<v Regina>What intrigued me about your work</v>

11
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.676
is that you're the person that's trying to bring

12
00:00:33.676 --> 00:00:36.663
the sanity and the heart back to the medical profession,

13
00:00:36.663 --> 00:00:38.860
and you would know this because you're an MD yourself,

14
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.202
and you've worked in some really interesting institutions

15
00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:43.975
in the past, such as the Heartmath Institute

16
00:00:43.975 --> 00:00:46.237
with Dean Ornish, and so forth.

17
00:00:46.237 --> 00:00:49.053
So, let's talk about where medicine is today,

18
00:00:49.053 --> 00:00:50.375
because by a lot of our viewers

19
00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:52.786
it's really being demonized now.

20
00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:55.858
<v ->Well, I understand why they demonize it,</v>

21
00:00:55.858 --> 00:00:57.692
because the experience is not good.

22
00:00:57.692 --> 00:00:59.292
The system is a mess,

23
00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:02.132
and just getting into the system is difficult,

24
00:01:02.132 --> 00:01:04.953
you know, like in any situation,

25
00:01:04.953 --> 00:01:06.596
with the voicemails, you know,

26
00:01:06.596 --> 00:01:09.262
the trains are trying to get into an appointment,

27
00:01:09.262 --> 00:01:10.401
people are overscheduled,

28
00:01:10.401 --> 00:01:13.487
so I understand the demonization of it.

29
00:01:13.487 --> 00:01:15.961
The practitioners themselves are in no way demons.

30
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:19.140
They really are truly trying to do a good job.

31
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.934
Some do well, some don't, but they're still trying.

32
00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:23.321
The heart is there, the presence is there,

33
00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:26.030
the intention is there to do a good job,

34
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.764
and demonizing just has no value anymore.

35
00:01:29.764 --> 00:01:31.265
For the average person,

36
00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:34.529
the person listening to this conversation today,

37
00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:37.515
I would say, find a physician that you can resonate with.

38
00:01:37.515 --> 00:01:39.649
Find a practitioner that you can resonate with,

39
00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.227
and work with that person.

40
00:01:41.227 --> 00:01:42.736
It's like any other environment.

41
00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:44.110
If you go to a shop to purchase something

42
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.993
and you don't like the people there, don't go back.

43
00:01:45.993 --> 00:01:46.960
<v Regina>Yeah, very true.</v>

44
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.901
<v ->I mean, it reallly is that simple.</v>

45
00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:49.906
<v Regina>Well, let's talk first of all,</v>

46
00:01:49.906 --> 00:01:53.128
I think it's nice to establish some kind of understanding.

47
00:01:53.128 --> 00:01:55.453
It's always good to walk in someone else's shoes.

48
00:01:55.453 --> 00:02:00.018
So let's talk about what people in the medical profession

49
00:02:00.018 --> 00:02:01.618
are up against these days,

50
00:02:01.618 --> 00:02:03.943
because everything I hear from younger doctors

51
00:02:03.943 --> 00:02:06.674
versus doctors who practiced 50 years ago

52
00:02:06.674 --> 00:02:07.655
and made house calls,

53
00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:08.871
it's a really different world,

54
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:10.749
there are a lot of different pressures.

55
00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:12.797
Give us a profile of what it's like

56
00:02:12.797 --> 00:02:15.357
to go through medical school, get out,

57
00:02:15.357 --> 00:02:18.706
and start a practice or go into an HMO now.

58
00:02:18.706 --> 00:02:21.692
<v ->So I'm going to paint you a very broad picture of that.</v>

59
00:02:21.692 --> 00:02:23.890
The first piece, getting into practice,

60
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.890
the average medical school graduate has a $180,000 debt.

61
00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:31.069
They're, generally speaking, in their late 20s

62
00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.234
by the time they finish their training, or early 30s.

63
00:02:34.234 --> 00:02:35.749
With that significant debt,

64
00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:38.607
they've never had really good employment,

65
00:02:38.607 --> 00:02:42.127
their residency programs pay them minimum wage, in essence,

66
00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:44.794
for roughly a 70-hour week.

67
00:02:44.794 --> 00:02:46.607
So they have this huge amount of debt

68
00:02:46.607 --> 00:02:47.972
at a time when they're generally trying

69
00:02:47.972 --> 00:02:50.916
to build a family and have a life.

70
00:02:50.916 --> 00:02:53.007
So their financial pressures are huge

71
00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:54.799
coming out of their training.

72
00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.042
In addition to that, the performance pressures are huge.

73
00:02:58.042 --> 00:02:59.878
Physicians today are measured,

74
00:02:59.878 --> 00:03:02.608
there's a term called "pay for performance."

75
00:03:02.608 --> 00:03:05.723
You're actually measured by your clinical outcomes,

76
00:03:05.723 --> 00:03:08.091
which sounds good at a basic level,

77
00:03:08.091 --> 00:03:12.443
but can you imagine if a car repair person was measured

78
00:03:12.443 --> 00:03:14.448
for the quality of the work they did,

79
00:03:14.448 --> 00:03:16.994
not for having just done the job?

80
00:03:16.994 --> 00:03:19.248
Now, again, some of your listeners

81
00:03:19.248 --> 00:03:20.997
may be offended by that statement,

82
00:03:20.997 --> 00:03:23.365
because doctors are not repairing cars,

83
00:03:23.365 --> 00:03:25.520
but we're working in a gray zone,

84
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.397
where you often don't know what's going on.

85
00:03:27.397 --> 00:03:29.496
You have an inkling of what the diagnosis might be

86
00:03:29.496 --> 00:03:31.002
or what the treatment might be,

87
00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:33.180
or there may be 10 or 20 different potential treatments

88
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.460
for any health cause.

89
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.086
So the decision process is not just black and white,

90
00:03:38.086 --> 00:03:41.527
and yet you're judged on that basis, okay?

91
00:03:41.527 --> 00:03:44.514
So you have that, you have the financial pressures,

92
00:03:44.514 --> 00:03:46.291
the pressures of generally starting a family

93
00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:48.146
when you're first getting out,

94
00:03:48.146 --> 00:03:50.173
and then you're stuck in most environments

95
00:03:50.173 --> 00:03:52.910
wth anywhere from a 10 to 15 minute office visit,

96
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.665
which no physician would find appropriate or reasonable.

97
00:03:56.665 --> 00:03:59.673
It's the pressure of the employer in that case,

98
00:03:59.673 --> 00:04:02.969
because frankly, most docs are now employed,

99
00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:04.367
the pressure of the employer

100
00:04:04.367 --> 00:04:06.671
to "crank 'em out," if you will.

101
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:08.463
So the new physician coming into practice

102
00:04:08.463 --> 00:04:12.196
is faced with a plethora of stresses and pressures,

103
00:04:12.196 --> 00:04:14.628
and it's very, very difficult for them to get started.

104
00:04:14.628 --> 00:04:16.441
<v Regina>Let's pick up on a thread you were talking about</v>

105
00:04:16.441 --> 00:04:19.407
a moment ago that they're actually paid for performance,

106
00:04:19.407 --> 00:04:20.921
which is a highly subjective thing,

107
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:22.564
and also, wouldn't that,

108
00:04:22.564 --> 00:04:25.444
because you only have 10 or 15 minutes with the patient,

109
00:04:25.444 --> 00:04:27.300
wouldn't that have to start showing itself

110
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.142
as the relief of the symptoms, almost?

111
00:04:32.142 --> 00:04:34.425
<v ->Well, it shows itself as the relief of the symptoms,</v>

112
00:04:34.425 --> 00:04:35.856
but that's not really true.

113
00:04:35.856 --> 00:04:37.925
In the environments that use paper performance,

114
00:04:37.925 --> 00:04:39.909
the highly-managed environments,

115
00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:42.898
it's more about the numbers.

116
00:04:42.898 --> 00:04:44.455
How low is the cholesterol?

117
00:04:44.455 --> 00:04:47.463
How well-controlled is the diabetes?

118
00:04:47.463 --> 00:04:50.868
Not how the patient experienced the visit, okay?

119
00:04:50.868 --> 00:04:51.731
Whereas if you look at

120
00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:54.762
actual patient satisfaction with their visits,

121
00:04:54.762 --> 00:04:56.648
it's a relationship-based experience.

122
00:04:56.648 --> 00:04:57.565
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

123
00:04:57.565 --> 00:04:59.896
<v ->So it's, "How did I like this person?"</v>

124
00:04:59.896 --> 00:05:01.326
"Did I learn from this person?"

125
00:05:01.326 --> 00:05:04.035
"Do I feel motivated to make change in my life

126
00:05:04.035 --> 00:05:07.560
because of this person that I was with, this physician?"

127
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.224
So paper performance and the physician-patient relationship

128
00:05:11.224 --> 00:05:13.506
sometimes are actually at odds.

129
00:05:13.506 --> 00:05:14.659
<v Regina>Yeah, that makes total sense.</v>

130
00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:16.328
I mean, you can give someone a drug

131
00:05:16.328 --> 00:05:20.190
and bring a particular stat theyr'e looking for down,

132
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.259
but that doesn't mean you've got a relationship

133
00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:23.999
and maybe even a healthy lifestyle shift

134
00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:24.989
with the patient, right?

135
00:05:24.989 --> 00:05:26.516
<v ->Right, so the end product for the patient</v>

136
00:05:26.516 --> 00:05:28.671
may be in fact something that's not desirable.

137
00:05:28.671 --> 00:05:29.653
There's an interesting study

138
00:05:29.653 --> 00:05:31.359
just very recently in the past few months

139
00:05:31.359 --> 00:05:34.111
looking at diabetic control in that kind of model,

140
00:05:34.111 --> 00:05:36.308
and the people who were very tightly-controlled

141
00:05:36.308 --> 00:05:39.700
actually did not live longer and had more complications

142
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.791
from their diabetes in the long run.

143
00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:43.445
So these numbers that we use

144
00:05:43.445 --> 00:05:45.323
may not even be appropriate numbers.

145
00:05:45.323 --> 00:05:49.739
They're just general numbers based on populations.

146
00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:52.725
So for the individual, they may actually have no relevance.

147
00:05:52.725 --> 00:05:55.605
So the physician is up against all of these issues.

148
00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:58.869
How they're measured, the time pressures,

149
00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:01.664
the performance pressures,

150
00:06:01.664 --> 00:06:04.225
and it makes it a very difficult situation

151
00:06:04.225 --> 00:06:06.763
to develop a real relationship with an individual.

152
00:06:06.763 --> 00:06:08.282
<v Regina>Absolutely, well what's happening,</v>

153
00:06:08.282 --> 00:06:11.624
even taking it further back to the decision-making process?

154
00:06:11.624 --> 00:06:12.706
Are there still a lot of people

155
00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:15.095
lining up for this out of naivety

156
00:06:15.095 --> 00:06:16.749
and not knowing what the reality of their job

157
00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:18.498
as a medical doctor is going to be?

158
00:06:18.498 --> 00:06:20.269
Is it still desirable?

159
00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:21.755
<v ->The answer is yes and no.</v>

160
00:06:21.755 --> 00:06:23.214
The people that are coming to med school now

161
00:06:23.214 --> 00:06:25.147
are a very different group

162
00:06:25.147 --> 00:06:28.520
than the people who came to medicine before.

163
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.412
In 1960s, let's say, 1970s,

164
00:06:31.412 --> 00:06:35.907
medicine was a high-money, prestigious thing.

165
00:06:35.907 --> 00:06:40.351
I was struck by a young Indian student who came to me

166
00:06:40.351 --> 00:06:42.293
embarrassed that he wanted to go to med school,

167
00:06:42.293 --> 00:06:44.722
because both of his parents wanted him to be engineers.

168
00:06:44.722 --> 00:06:45.571
<v Regina>Uh-huh.</v>

169
00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:47.205
<v ->You wouldn't have seen that 30 years ago.</v>

170
00:06:47.205 --> 00:06:47.957
<v Regina>Right.</v>

171
00:06:47.957 --> 00:06:49.286
<v ->So medicine doesn't have the prestige</v>

172
00:06:49.286 --> 00:06:51.249
that it used to have.

173
00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:54.513
So the person who's dedicated or driven to go into medicine

174
00:06:54.513 --> 00:06:56.944
in many ways is truly a caregiver,

175
00:06:56.944 --> 00:06:58.514
and I'm actually frankly delighted by that.

176
00:06:58.514 --> 00:06:59.288
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

177
00:06:59.288 --> 00:07:00.246
<v ->They're not there for the money.</v>

178
00:07:00.246 --> 00:07:02.124
If you went into medicine to make money, good luck.

179
00:07:02.124 --> 00:07:03.841
It's a foolish endeavor.

180
00:07:03.841 --> 00:07:04.974
<v Regina>No, and really, that's true.</v>

181
00:07:04.974 --> 00:07:05.948
It's just not happening anymore.

182
00:07:05.948 --> 00:07:07.774
<v ->Oh, it's just not happening that way anymore.</v>

183
00:07:07.774 --> 00:07:08.585
<v Regina>Really.</v>

184
00:07:08.585 --> 00:07:10.996
<v ->Whereas you really need to enter for the passion,</v>

185
00:07:10.996 --> 00:07:13.556
the desire to take care of other people,

186
00:07:13.556 --> 00:07:15.186
the desire to take care of people

187
00:07:15.186 --> 00:07:18.236
either in a population or a one-on-one basis.

188
00:07:18.236 --> 00:07:20.391
The desire to do non-profit work

189
00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:23.612
is a big driver for many young medical students today.

190
00:07:23.612 --> 00:07:27.026
And again, what this does for me is it gives me great hope,

191
00:07:27.026 --> 00:07:29.453
because the type of person who's going into medicine today

192
00:07:29.453 --> 00:07:32.056
is truly going into medicine for healthy reasons,

193
00:07:32.056 --> 00:07:34.125
for service reasons,

194
00:07:34.125 --> 00:07:37.368
because, with $180,000 debt after your training

195
00:07:37.368 --> 00:07:39.416
and an average income, let's say for a pediatrician,

196
00:07:39.416 --> 00:07:43.042
of $130,000 a year, it ain't easy.

197
00:07:43.042 --> 00:07:44.313
<v Regina>Not after eight years of schooling,</v>

198
00:07:44.313 --> 00:07:45.418
with that big debt you're carrying,

199
00:07:45.418 --> 00:07:47.552
and also, there are people who don't even

200
00:07:47.552 --> 00:07:48.832
make it through the experience.

201
00:07:48.832 --> 00:07:50.726
I was reading one of your newsletters recently

202
00:07:50.726 --> 00:07:52.006
and you were talking,

203
00:07:52.006 --> 00:07:53.840
because you're talking to healthcare professionals

204
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.590
about how to find balance in their own lives

205
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.680
because their lives are so out of balance

206
00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.088
with these pressures.

207
00:07:59.088 --> 00:08:01.157
And you were talking about the most at-risk people

208
00:08:01.157 --> 00:08:05.376
being young women, female residents,

209
00:08:05.376 --> 00:08:07.655
where you're even talking suicides,

210
00:08:07.655 --> 00:08:10.030
because they can't balance family.

211
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.244
<v ->Mm-hmm, the highest suicide rate, unfortunately,</v>

212
00:08:12.244 --> 00:08:15.572
in medicine, is women between the age 35 and 40,

213
00:08:15.572 --> 00:08:20.137
and the setup for that is the huge financial pressure,

214
00:08:20.137 --> 00:08:23.571
the pressure from the medical system for high performance,

215
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:26.409
the internal pressure, if they are parents,

216
00:08:26.409 --> 00:08:30.526
to be a good parent, a complete parent, if you will,

217
00:08:30.526 --> 00:08:34.169
and because of the busyness of a medical life,

218
00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:37.071
it's really impossible to be a complete parent

219
00:08:37.071 --> 00:08:38.863
and to be a doctor that meets

220
00:08:38.863 --> 00:08:41.785
the standard of being the doctor.

221
00:08:41.785 --> 00:08:45.902
Now, 80-90% of physicians are perfectionists,

222
00:08:45.902 --> 00:08:48.313
and if you give that impossible task to a perfectionist,

223
00:08:48.313 --> 00:08:49.230
the outcome is going to be

224
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.908
anxiety, frustration, and depression.

225
00:08:51.908 --> 00:08:54.383
And for that reason, it's why women

226
00:08:54.383 --> 00:08:56.218
have the highest suicide rates.

227
00:08:56.218 --> 00:08:58.905
Men, it's a little bit less, because the social pressures

228
00:08:58.905 --> 00:09:02.779
about parenthood are less for men than they are for women.

229
00:09:02.779 --> 00:09:03.825
And again, that's why you see

230
00:09:03.825 --> 00:09:07.530
such a disturbing suicide rate in that population.

231
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.350
<v Regina>You were talking a moment ago</v>

232
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.970
about the new doctor, the young person

233
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.560
going into medicine today,

234
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.928
and let's talk about that and how it interfaces

235
00:09:17.928 --> 00:09:21.066
with what has been called alternative medicine.

236
00:09:21.066 --> 00:09:23.924
What kind of trends are you seeing away from just,

237
00:09:23.924 --> 00:09:27.231
"It's out of the textbook, I'm not looking at anything else,

238
00:09:27.231 --> 00:09:30.282
I'm doing what I'm told to do," to what you're seeing,

239
00:09:30.282 --> 00:09:31.753
what are you seeing now?

240
00:09:31.753 --> 00:09:33.908
<v ->Well, the beauty and the nice thing</v>

241
00:09:33.908 --> 00:09:36.340
and the thrilling thing for me

242
00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.426
is that alternative medicine is a term

243
00:09:38.426 --> 00:09:40.687
that happened 20+ years ago,

244
00:09:40.687 --> 00:09:43.648
when it really was an "us versus them."

245
00:09:43.648 --> 00:09:47.082
The "us," in my case, I actually have been a bridge,

246
00:09:47.082 --> 00:09:50.112
so I don't know that I was ever on either side,

247
00:09:50.112 --> 00:09:51.754
but you know, I was teaching yoga

248
00:09:51.754 --> 00:09:53.951
to heart patients 30 years ago.

249
00:09:53.951 --> 00:09:56.962
That was an "us versus them" scenario.

250
00:09:56.962 --> 00:09:58.825
<v Regina>And you were a young MD at that time.</v>

251
00:09:58.825 --> 00:10:00.346
<v ->Yeah, and you know, I was just in practice,</v>

252
00:10:00.346 --> 00:10:03.290
but telling them to meditate, to do yoga,

253
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.509
to eat vegetarian diets, these sort of things,

254
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:08.732
which was very outside the box then; today it's mainstream.

255
00:10:08.732 --> 00:10:09.792
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

256
00:10:09.792 --> 00:10:11.854
That's a significant shift.

257
00:10:11.854 --> 00:10:14.535
One of the reasons I stopped doing research in that area

258
00:10:14.535 --> 00:10:18.226
was because I was exercising, watching a baseball game,

259
00:10:18.226 --> 00:10:20.956
and an advertisement came on for the local fitness center,

260
00:10:20.956 --> 00:10:22.770
the Mountain Fitness Center,

261
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.095
yoga classes for heart patients.

262
00:10:25.095 --> 00:10:26.268
And I knew at that point,

263
00:10:26.268 --> 00:10:28.060
I didn't need to research that anymore.

264
00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.087
It was just being done.

265
00:10:30.087 --> 00:10:33.074
So what's happened in the last 20 or 30 years

266
00:10:33.074 --> 00:10:34.844
is we've moved from a scenario

267
00:10:34.844 --> 00:10:37.490
where these things that once were alternative

268
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.602
are now very often mainstream.

269
00:10:39.602 --> 00:10:41.074
Yoga's a good example of that.

270
00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:43.633
Meditation is a very good example of that.

271
00:10:43.633 --> 00:10:46.215
Acupuncture is a very good example of that.

272
00:10:46.215 --> 00:10:49.095
That these things are offered in most communities nowadays.

273
00:10:49.095 --> 00:10:52.807
So, there really isn't an "us or them" mentality anymore.

274
00:10:52.807 --> 00:10:54.855
The beauty of today's medical student,

275
00:10:54.855 --> 00:10:56.777
they want to know what works for their patient.

276
00:10:56.777 --> 00:10:57.415
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

277
00:10:57.415 --> 00:10:59.114
<v ->They don't care where it came from.</v>

278
00:10:59.114 --> 00:11:00.656
Whether it came from Asia,

279
00:11:00.656 --> 00:11:02.107
whether it came from South America,

280
00:11:02.107 --> 00:11:03.643
whether it came from New York,

281
00:11:03.643 --> 00:11:06.245
they don't care, as long as it works for their patient.

282
00:11:06.245 --> 00:11:08.555
So in many ways, to the medical student,

283
00:11:08.555 --> 00:11:11.982
the 25-year-old of today, there is no "alternative."

284
00:11:11.982 --> 00:11:13.966
It's just healthcare.

285
00:11:13.966 --> 00:11:16.675
<v Regina>How does that move</v>

286
00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:20.622
with the dictates of the hospital and hospital protocol

287
00:11:20.622 --> 00:11:23.672
and, as we all know, the pharmaceutical links

288
00:11:23.672 --> 00:11:26.211
to the hospitals, to the continuing education

289
00:11:26.211 --> 00:11:27.491
of MDs and so forth,

290
00:11:27.491 --> 00:11:30.584
how does Big Pharma fit in with a 25-year-old

291
00:11:30.584 --> 00:11:32.398
who wants to do what works for their patient

292
00:11:32.398 --> 00:11:34.083
and it may not mean drug therapy.

293
00:11:34.083 --> 00:11:35.832
<v ->I will raise a very simple point.</v>

294
00:11:35.832 --> 00:11:37.603
What percent, and I don't know the exact number,

295
00:11:37.603 --> 00:11:41.549
but what percent of Big Pharma owns companies

296
00:11:41.549 --> 00:11:46.549
that make "alternative medicine" herbal products?

297
00:11:46.549 --> 00:11:47.371
<v Regina>(mumbles)</v>

298
00:11:47.371 --> 00:11:48.427
<v ->Right, supplements.</v>

299
00:11:48.427 --> 00:11:49.021
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

300
00:11:49.021 --> 00:11:49.707
<v ->Okay, it's huge.</v>

301
00:11:49.707 --> 00:11:50.561
<v Regina>It's huge now.</v>

302
00:11:50.561 --> 00:11:51.371
<v ->It's huge.</v>

303
00:11:51.371 --> 00:11:54.737
I would say that, if not all, 99%.

304
00:11:54.737 --> 00:11:57.254
So that world has changed as well.

305
00:11:57.254 --> 00:12:00.710
It's not prescribed, per se, but it's used.

306
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:02.801
And if you look at the statistical data,

307
00:12:02.801 --> 00:12:04.337
more than half of Americans use

308
00:12:04.337 --> 00:12:07.430
"alternative products" these days.

309
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.585
So, it is becoming big business,

310
00:12:09.585 --> 00:12:11.185
and I'm not an anti-capitalist.

311
00:12:11.185 --> 00:12:14.918
I think that it's reasonable to have a big business,

312
00:12:14.918 --> 00:12:16.262
if it's doing good work.

313
00:12:16.262 --> 00:12:18.139
<v Regina>Well, I mean, in truth,</v>

314
00:12:18.139 --> 00:12:20.038
now we get into some areas that are interesting

315
00:12:20.038 --> 00:12:22.555
because there appear to be conflicts in here,

316
00:12:22.555 --> 00:12:26.651
which is that big pharmaceutical companies, as you say,

317
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:31.303
have purchased a lot of mom and pop and large

318
00:12:31.303 --> 00:12:33.949
natural food and supplement companies.

319
00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:35.347
<v ->Right.</v>

320
00:12:35.347 --> 00:12:36.883
<v Regina>So they're obviously looking</v>

321
00:12:36.883 --> 00:12:38.312
to expand their market share,

322
00:12:38.312 --> 00:12:40.031
because maybe they see the writing on the wall,

323
00:12:40.031 --> 00:12:41.610
but on the other hand, the push

324
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:45.236
for the use of pharmaceuticals from kindergarten on

325
00:12:45.236 --> 00:12:48.820
is probably more pervasive than ever.

326
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.550
Where do you see this,

327
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.759
where do you see it now and where do you see it going,

328
00:12:53.759 --> 00:12:55.384
because there's conflict here,

329
00:12:55.384 --> 00:12:58.307
it's giving two distinctly different messages to the people

330
00:12:58.307 --> 00:12:59.885
and trying to cash in both ways.

331
00:12:59.885 --> 00:13:02.125
<v ->Well, I would say that it truly becomes</v>

332
00:13:02.125 --> 00:13:04.984
up to the American public where it goes.

333
00:13:04.984 --> 00:13:07.565
If the American public keeps buying into the

334
00:13:07.565 --> 00:13:10.573
"Give me the pill and make these symptoms go away" model,

335
00:13:10.573 --> 00:13:11.810
then those Big Pharma companies

336
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.680
producing pharmaceutical drugs for ten-year-olds

337
00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.944
are gonna succeed in that mission.

338
00:13:17.944 --> 00:13:21.144
If America says, "No, we don't wanna do that anymore.

339
00:13:21.144 --> 00:13:23.465
I don't want my kid on an anti-depressant

340
00:13:23.465 --> 00:13:25.876
or something against ADD,"

341
00:13:25.876 --> 00:13:30.740
that, " I really wanna work in healthy ways with my family,"

342
00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.425
then the Big Pharma doesn't do that,

343
00:13:32.425 --> 00:13:35.476
they'll move more naturally into herbal products, etc.

344
00:13:35.476 --> 00:13:36.469
<v Regina>They'll go where the money is.</v>

345
00:13:36.469 --> 00:13:37.570
<v ->They'll go where the money is.</v>

346
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.554
So it really becomes our choice.

347
00:13:39.554 --> 00:13:44.157
So what I encourage your listeners, your viewers to do,

348
00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:46.418
is to really make a conscious choice

349
00:13:46.418 --> 00:13:48.402
about how they want to be treated.

350
00:13:48.402 --> 00:13:50.492
Do they wanna walk into a physician's office

351
00:13:50.492 --> 00:13:53.287
and just get a piece of paper written with a pill,

352
00:13:53.287 --> 00:13:57.874
and they can go do that and get treated that way,

353
00:13:57.874 --> 00:13:59.789
or do they want to make conscious decisions?

354
00:13:59.789 --> 00:14:02.157
So they wanna go on the web, do they wanna find resources,

355
00:14:02.157 --> 00:14:05.186
do they wanna learn and be an educated consumer?

356
00:14:05.186 --> 00:14:07.597
And I really encourage your folks to do that,

357
00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:09.730
to be the educated consumer,

358
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:13.271
and then go to their physician with concise questions.

359
00:14:13.271 --> 00:14:14.551
Not the laundry list,

360
00:14:14.551 --> 00:14:16.535
because in a 15-minute office visit,

361
00:14:16.535 --> 00:14:18.030
20 questions can't work.

362
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:18.829
<v Regina>Right.</v>

363
00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:20.109
<v ->But what are the prime questions</v>

364
00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:21.901
that you have for your clinician?

365
00:14:21.901 --> 00:14:22.861
And then to be educated

366
00:14:22.861 --> 00:14:25.015
about who you ask those questions to.

367
00:14:25.015 --> 00:14:27.758
If I go to a surgeon, and I'm asking questions

368
00:14:27.758 --> 00:14:31.532
about herbal therapy for a non-surgical situation,

369
00:14:31.532 --> 00:14:32.989
it' s not gonna work.

370
00:14:32.989 --> 00:14:34.627
<v Regina>Right, go to the appropriate person.</v>

371
00:14:34.627 --> 00:14:37.027
<v ->Go to the appropriate person to ask the question.</v>

372
00:14:37.027 --> 00:14:38.264
Now, how do you do that?

373
00:14:38.264 --> 00:14:39.715
It's sometimes difficult.

374
00:14:39.715 --> 00:14:41.976
Ask your friends.

375
00:14:41.976 --> 00:14:46.023
Who in the community offers services that appeal to me?

376
00:14:46.023 --> 00:14:47.508
Okay?

377
00:14:47.508 --> 00:14:50.485
Look at the holisticboard.org, which is the

378
00:14:50.485 --> 00:14:53.019
American Board of Integrative Holistic Medicine.

379
00:14:53.019 --> 00:14:55.260
They have 1100 docs trained

380
00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.672
throughout the U.S. in this arena.

381
00:14:57.672 --> 00:14:59.577
So, look at holisticboard.org

382
00:14:59.577 --> 00:15:01.110
and see if there are docs in your area.

383
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.983
<v Regina>Holistic...</v>

384
00:15:01.983 --> 00:15:02.590
<v ->Board.</v>

385
00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:03.140
<v Regina>Board, okay.</v>

386
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:03.749
<v ->.org.</v>

387
00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:04.232
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

388
00:15:04.232 --> 00:15:05.149
<v ->Okay.</v>

389
00:15:05.149 --> 00:15:07.091
See if there are docs trained in this area.

390
00:15:07.091 --> 00:15:08.755
Contact the University of Arizona

391
00:15:08.755 --> 00:15:10.697
Program for Integrative Medicine.

392
00:15:10.697 --> 00:15:12.872
They have 500 fellows (laughs)

393
00:15:12.872 --> 00:15:15.070
that have been trained in integrative medicine.

394
00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:16.414
Find out who in your neighborhood

395
00:15:16.414 --> 00:15:17.540
delivers that service as well.

396
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.863
<v Regina>What about naturopaths?</v>

397
00:15:18.863 --> 00:15:20.996
<v ->Naturopaths, fantastic.</v>

398
00:15:20.996 --> 00:15:24.132
There's huge variants in state-to-state regulations

399
00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:25.775
around naturopathy.

400
00:15:25.775 --> 00:15:27.033
We're very lucky, in California,

401
00:15:27.033 --> 00:15:29.508
that they're actually given full licensure at this point.

402
00:15:29.508 --> 00:15:33.390
It's in a trial phase, but it's going well.

403
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.652
Naturopaths, there's two levels of naturopathy,

404
00:15:35.652 --> 00:15:37.102
there's the four-year naturopaths

405
00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:38.800
and the two-year trained naturopaths.

406
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.740
I do think there's a qualitative difference between the two.

407
00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.193
Personal preference, and I hope to offend no one,

408
00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:45.869
but I think I would choose someone

409
00:15:45.869 --> 00:15:47.490
who's gone through the four-year training

410
00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:50.968
from a Bastyr University or one of the four-year colleges.

411
00:15:50.968 --> 00:15:52.781
But naturopaths look at nutrition.

412
00:15:52.781 --> 00:15:54.594
They look at lifestyle.

413
00:15:54.594 --> 00:15:56.599
They look at health education.

414
00:15:56.599 --> 00:15:58.391
And that's their primary mission,

415
00:15:58.391 --> 00:16:00.300
and I really encourage that.

416
00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.059
Osteopathy.

417
00:16:01.059 --> 00:16:02.125
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

418
00:16:02.125 --> 00:16:03.086
<v ->Fantastic.</v>

419
00:16:03.086 --> 00:16:04.366
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

420
00:16:04.366 --> 00:16:05.854
<v ->Don't go to an osteopath,</v>

421
00:16:05.854 --> 00:16:07.476
again, if this is your preference,

422
00:16:07.476 --> 00:16:09.694
don't go to an osteopath who just wants to be an MD

423
00:16:09.694 --> 00:16:11.604
but happened to go to a DO school.

424
00:16:11.604 --> 00:16:14.100
Go to an osteopath who knows manual therapy.

425
00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.233
Manual therapy is a fantastic treatment

426
00:16:16.233 --> 00:16:19.945
for many, many structural issues and other health issues.

427
00:16:19.945 --> 00:16:21.033
There are great osteopaths

428
00:16:21.033 --> 00:16:23.678
who do fantastic work with manual therapy.

429
00:16:23.678 --> 00:16:25.044
They're out there, they're well-trained.

430
00:16:25.044 --> 00:16:27.177
Every one of them had it in school;

431
00:16:27.177 --> 00:16:28.756
whether they bring it into their practice or not

432
00:16:28.756 --> 00:16:30.569
is a personal choice for them.

433
00:16:30.569 --> 00:16:33.406
So, osteopaths, naturopaths,

434
00:16:33.406 --> 00:16:36.350
very, very useful.

435
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:39.934
There are clinicians out there that I am concerned about,

436
00:16:39.934 --> 00:16:42.731
mostly based on the individual, not their training.

437
00:16:42.731 --> 00:16:43.425
<v Regina>Right.</v>

438
00:16:43.425 --> 00:16:43.944
<v ->Okay.</v>

439
00:16:43.944 --> 00:16:45.928
There are very sparsely-trained people

440
00:16:45.928 --> 00:16:47.826
that do phenomenal work. (laughs)

441
00:16:47.826 --> 00:16:50.344
And there are people who have incredible training

442
00:16:50.344 --> 00:16:53.086
who do terrible work, and that includes some MDs and DOs.

443
00:16:53.086 --> 00:16:53.747
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

444
00:16:53.747 --> 00:16:57.575
<v ->So, really, it's finding the individual who you can trust</v>

445
00:16:57.575 --> 00:16:59.132
through your family recommendations,

446
00:16:59.132 --> 00:17:00.561
recommendations of friends,

447
00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:02.413
and then your personal experience with the individual.

448
00:17:02.413 --> 00:17:03.714
<v Regina>So it really comes down to,</v>

449
00:17:03.714 --> 00:17:04.866
like everything else in life,

450
00:17:04.866 --> 00:17:06.894
you have to take a high degree of personal responsibility

451
00:17:06.894 --> 00:17:08.367
if you're going to enlist the support

452
00:17:08.367 --> 00:17:09.604
of any other human being

453
00:17:09.604 --> 00:17:13.500
to help you with your health and the health of your family.

454
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.782
<v ->And Regina, I will amplify that many, many times.</v>

455
00:17:15.782 --> 00:17:18.521
It takes a high degree of responsibility to be healthy.

456
00:17:18.521 --> 00:17:19.127
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

457
00:17:19.127 --> 00:17:21.265
<v ->You can't be lazy about health.</v>

458
00:17:21.265 --> 00:17:22.161
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

459
00:17:22.161 --> 00:17:24.770
<v ->Okay, if you expect someone to write you a pill,</v>

460
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:27.351
give you a script, give you an herb,

461
00:17:27.351 --> 00:17:29.399
stick needles in your acupuncture points,

462
00:17:29.399 --> 00:17:32.279
and you're gonna get better, good luck.

463
00:17:32.279 --> 00:17:35.798
And I say that with a bit of a dogmatic stance,

464
00:17:35.798 --> 00:17:37.108
because you really do need

465
00:17:37.108 --> 00:17:39.275
to take responsibility for your health,

466
00:17:39.275 --> 00:17:41.835
that you need to eat well, you need to exercise well,

467
00:17:41.835 --> 00:17:43.350
you need to have love in your life

468
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.440
and relationships in your life that work.

469
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.573
And if you have trouble with that, as many people do,

470
00:17:47.573 --> 00:17:49.707
work with a therapist to learn how to do those things.

471
00:17:49.707 --> 00:17:52.125
These are learnable skills, if you will.

472
00:17:52.125 --> 00:17:53.606
But take the responsiblity.

473
00:17:53.606 --> 00:17:56.187
The individual responsibility is so important.

474
00:17:56.187 --> 00:17:58.477
The day of the guru doc

475
00:17:58.477 --> 00:18:00.669
who tells you everything you need to do,

476
00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:03.463
is dead, because it doesn't work.

477
00:18:03.463 --> 00:18:06.279
The day of individual responsibility for the patient

478
00:18:06.279 --> 00:18:07.922
is alive and growing,

479
00:18:07.922 --> 00:18:10.503
and I really can't say that loudly enough.

480
00:18:10.503 --> 00:18:11.570
<v Regina>I couldn't agree more</v>

481
00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:12.679
with everything you just said

482
00:18:12.679 --> 00:18:14.898
and you've given us a wonderful directory

483
00:18:14.898 --> 00:18:18.119
of different types of practitioners to find,

484
00:18:18.119 --> 00:18:19.005
to work with.

485
00:18:19.005 --> 00:18:20.349
But what happens to a person

486
00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:22.248
that's more or less with an HMO,

487
00:18:22.248 --> 00:18:25.128
their work is paying for it, they're stuck,

488
00:18:25.128 --> 00:18:27.538
and they cannot seem to find

489
00:18:27.538 --> 00:18:29.799
the kind of people that are open to new ideas.

490
00:18:29.799 --> 00:18:31.378
What do you do?

491
00:18:31.378 --> 00:18:34.237
<v ->Well, from a financial perspective they are stuck.</v>

492
00:18:34.237 --> 00:18:35.239
If you really can't afford

493
00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:36.839
to go outside of that existing system

494
00:18:36.839 --> 00:18:37.885
and that's the only system

495
00:18:37.885 --> 00:18:39.883
that's available to you financially,

496
00:18:39.883 --> 00:18:41.414
honestly you are stuck.

497
00:18:41.414 --> 00:18:43.739
However, you're not stuck as far as your own

498
00:18:43.739 --> 00:18:47.462
personal responsibility, your own lifestyle choices.

499
00:18:47.462 --> 00:18:50.001
Practicing yoga or meditation is cheap,

500
00:18:50.001 --> 00:18:51.474
and free (laughs) for many.

501
00:18:51.474 --> 00:18:53.370
<v Regina>That's right, absolutely.</v>

502
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:57.453
<v ->Exercising is free, going out for a walk is free.</v>

503
00:18:57.453 --> 00:19:00.995
Choosing vegetables over pork is free, (laughs), okay?

504
00:19:00.995 --> 00:19:02.296
So, even though you may be stuck

505
00:19:02.296 --> 00:19:04.664
from a medical delivery perspective,

506
00:19:04.664 --> 00:19:07.352
you're not stuck from a personal perspective.

507
00:19:07.352 --> 00:19:09.864
The other beauty that exists today

508
00:19:09.864 --> 00:19:11.673
that didn't exist 10 or 15 years ago

509
00:19:11.673 --> 00:19:13.683
is there's so much good information on the web.

510
00:19:13.683 --> 00:19:14.634
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

511
00:19:14.634 --> 00:19:16.348
<v ->You can go to a good web source</v>

512
00:19:16.348 --> 00:19:19.121
and learn about your health issues or concerns,

513
00:19:19.121 --> 00:19:21.596
and then take proactive lifestyle measures

514
00:19:21.596 --> 00:19:25.436
in that direction without ever having to see a practitioner.

515
00:19:25.436 --> 00:19:27.697
So there's so many good resources,

516
00:19:27.697 --> 00:19:29.788
but if you are stuck in that way,

517
00:19:29.788 --> 00:19:32.497
you really are challenged to do the work yourself.

518
00:19:32.497 --> 00:19:34.630
<v Regina>And, as you were saying earlier,</v>

519
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:37.361
at least there's hope for the future as these young people

520
00:19:37.361 --> 00:19:39.857
that are totally demanding and embracing

521
00:19:39.857 --> 00:19:43.441
new health practices, new healing practices.

522
00:19:43.441 --> 00:19:44.908
As they start becoming more mature

523
00:19:44.908 --> 00:19:47.916
and the real backbone of these HMOs in the future,

524
00:19:47.916 --> 00:19:49.238
they're going to probably

525
00:19:49.238 --> 00:19:51.244
have more available to them, right?

526
00:19:51.244 --> 00:19:52.353
<v ->Right, there' s question that</v>

527
00:19:52.353 --> 00:19:55.510
as the new doc goes into the system,

528
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:57.980
and especially I'm very optimistic about the Gen Y doc,

529
00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.516
even though they're not quite there yet,

530
00:19:59.516 --> 00:20:02.140
you know the people that are under 25 now?

531
00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.721
They're very open and very service-based,

532
00:20:04.721 --> 00:20:06.172
and it's beautiful to watch.

533
00:20:06.172 --> 00:20:07.707
They're also very technically-savvy,

534
00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:09.755
so they're gonna access information.

535
00:20:09.755 --> 00:20:11.995
But in addition to that, I wanna make another point.

536
00:20:11.995 --> 00:20:14.641
The healthcare of the future is not gonna be based

537
00:20:14.641 --> 00:20:18.054
on the one-and-one physicial-patient visit.

538
00:20:18.054 --> 00:20:21.019
And the reason I say that, it's too expensive.

539
00:20:21.019 --> 00:20:23.174
And the population is growing at a rate

540
00:20:23.174 --> 00:20:24.603
where that's not affordable,

541
00:20:24.603 --> 00:20:26.587
because number of doctors is not growing

542
00:20:26.587 --> 00:20:28.273
at an equivalent rate.

543
00:20:28.273 --> 00:20:29.808
So it becomes impossible to make that

544
00:20:29.808 --> 00:20:31.366
the basis of healthcare.

545
00:20:31.366 --> 00:20:32.539
If you look at some of the models

546
00:20:32.539 --> 00:20:35.526
of "disease management for large populations,"

547
00:20:35.526 --> 00:20:38.555
nurse case management, health coaching,

548
00:20:38.555 --> 00:20:41.234
these things actually become extraordinarily effective.

549
00:20:41.234 --> 00:20:44.157
And the educated health consumer, if you will,

550
00:20:44.157 --> 00:20:46.653
who can go online, read, and learn,

551
00:20:46.653 --> 00:20:50.130
and be wise walking into any of those visits,

552
00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:51.602
does so much better than the person

553
00:20:51.602 --> 00:20:53.159
who just blindly walks in and says,

554
00:20:53.159 --> 00:20:54.333
"What should I do, doc?"

555
00:20:54.333 --> 00:20:56.743
and that's the end of the conversation.

556
00:20:56.743 --> 00:20:59.047
So, it's gonna change.

557
00:20:59.047 --> 00:21:01.010
We're not gonna be one-to-one,

558
00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:03.741
doc-patient visits in the future,

559
00:21:03.741 --> 00:21:06.725
mostly because it's not affordable for the mass population.

560
00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:08.082
<v Regina>Right.</v>

561
00:21:08.082 --> 00:21:11.049
<v ->And frankly, that may be better, because that creates</v>

562
00:21:11.049 --> 00:21:13.203
a paternalistic viewpoint towards the patient,

563
00:21:13.203 --> 00:21:14.603
"I'm the doctor, I know the answer.

564
00:21:14.603 --> 00:21:16.187
You're the patient, you're supposed to listen to me."

565
00:21:16.187 --> 00:21:17.044
<v Regina>That's right.</v>

566
00:21:17.044 --> 00:21:18.230
<v ->I don't think that's healthy anyhow.</v>

567
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.470
So, I think we may be moving in a better direction,

568
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.542
it's just not gonna be what it looked like 20 years ago.

569
00:21:23.542 --> 00:21:26.102
<v Regina>So when you have nurses groups</v>

570
00:21:26.102 --> 00:21:27.745
that you work with and consult,

571
00:21:27.745 --> 00:21:30.807
and you have also doctors you work with,

572
00:21:30.807 --> 00:21:32.023
what are you hearing,

573
00:21:32.023 --> 00:21:34.412
now going back to put ourselves in their shoes,

574
00:21:34.412 --> 00:21:36.737
what is the largest complaint you're hearing

575
00:21:36.737 --> 00:21:39.980
from each group, both the nurses and the doctors?

576
00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.582
<v ->Two words, overwhelm and burnout.</v>

577
00:21:42.582 --> 00:21:44.258
Overwhelm, in that the patient volumes

578
00:21:44.258 --> 00:21:45.858
are just far too great.

579
00:21:45.858 --> 00:21:48.781
The average physician today sees about 25 patients a day,

580
00:21:48.781 --> 00:21:51.730
in average 15-minutes office visits.

581
00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.810
Generally speaking, by about 11:30 in the morning,

582
00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:55.107
they're burnt out, okay?

583
00:21:55.107 --> 00:21:55.917
<v Regina>You don't wanna make</v>

584
00:21:55.917 --> 00:21:56.953
an afternoon appointment, then.

585
00:21:56.953 --> 00:21:57.589
<v ->Right, right.</v>

586
00:21:57.589 --> 00:21:59.360
Honestly, yeah, if you're going to make an appointment,

587
00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.877
about 9am is about the right time (laughs).

588
00:22:01.877 --> 00:22:02.922
<v Regina>(laughs)</v>

589
00:22:02.922 --> 00:22:05.580
<v ->After they've had their coffee, before they're toast.</v>

590
00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:06.945
(laughs)

591
00:22:06.945 --> 00:22:10.764
So, morning appointments are good things.

592
00:22:10.764 --> 00:22:14.040
That's one piece, average burnout for physicians,

593
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:14.976
with the question,

594
00:22:14.976 --> 00:22:16.448
"Have you experienced burnout in the past year?"

595
00:22:16.448 --> 00:22:20.940
about 67%, for nurses about 72%.

596
00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.097
There's a significant per-capita shortage

597
00:22:23.097 --> 00:22:26.553
of both nurses and physicians in some environments,

598
00:22:26.553 --> 00:22:28.857
most environments these days.

599
00:22:28.857 --> 00:22:31.097
Specialists, not so much in the big cities.

600
00:22:31.097 --> 00:22:32.846
There's actually kind of a dearth,

601
00:22:32.846 --> 00:22:34.296
or I'm sorry, an overflow

602
00:22:34.296 --> 00:22:37.603
of specialists in most environments.

603
00:22:37.603 --> 00:22:38.862
But finding a primary care doc

604
00:22:38.862 --> 00:22:40.632
is actually becoming more and more difficult,

605
00:22:40.632 --> 00:22:42.488
because people going to primary care medicine

606
00:22:42.488 --> 00:22:46.328
has dropped significantly, especially family medicine.

607
00:22:46.328 --> 00:22:47.578
That's then.

608
00:22:47.578 --> 00:22:48.378
<v Regina>Right.</v>

609
00:22:48.378 --> 00:22:49.557
<v ->Now what we're seeing,</v>

610
00:22:49.557 --> 00:22:52.053
and this is especially true with the current administration,

611
00:22:52.053 --> 00:22:53.952
is that primary care is going to be featured

612
00:22:53.952 --> 00:22:55.322
in the new model of medicine.

613
00:22:55.322 --> 00:22:56.090
<v Regina>Uh-huh.</v>

614
00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:57.925
<v ->Okay, that the the first visit is going to be</v>

615
00:22:57.925 --> 00:22:59.546
a primary care visit.

616
00:22:59.546 --> 00:23:01.350
This is gonna make primary care medicine

617
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:04.198
much more attractive to the practitioner.

618
00:23:04.198 --> 00:23:06.162
It's gonna be much more of what it should be,

619
00:23:06.162 --> 00:23:09.169
which is the diagnostition, the screening.

620
00:23:09.169 --> 00:23:11.217
But then moving that person to, say,

621
00:23:11.217 --> 00:23:13.649
a nurse case manager, a nutritionist,

622
00:23:13.649 --> 00:23:15.377
someone who can educate the person,

623
00:23:15.377 --> 00:23:18.363
work with them, frankly at a lower cost per visit,

624
00:23:18.363 --> 00:23:20.507
to move them into a healthier lifestyle.

625
00:23:20.507 --> 00:23:21.636
<v Regina>It makes sense.</v>

626
00:23:21.636 --> 00:23:22.312
<v ->Mm-hmm.</v>

627
00:23:22.312 --> 00:23:23.780
<v Regina>Kaiser Permanente, for example,</v>

628
00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.549
seems to be a hybridization of a lot of these things.

629
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:29.323
Everybody is assigned a primary care physician

630
00:23:29.323 --> 00:23:32.139
and here you go online now at Kaiser Permanente,

631
00:23:32.139 --> 00:23:35.211
and they'll have the profiles and pictures

632
00:23:35.211 --> 00:23:38.475
and hobbies and philosophies

633
00:23:38.475 --> 00:23:41.304
of all of the different doctors to choose from,

634
00:23:41.304 --> 00:23:44.122
so a person can feel as though they're having some say

635
00:23:44.122 --> 00:23:45.796
over the kind of person they wanna meet with,

636
00:23:45.796 --> 00:23:47.083
and I suppose if you didn't like them,

637
00:23:47.083 --> 00:23:48.279
you would move on, right?

638
00:23:48.279 --> 00:23:48.997
<v ->Sure.</v>

639
00:23:48.997 --> 00:23:50.575
<v Regina>Find the next person until you find</v>

640
00:23:50.575 --> 00:23:52.963
one that you feel is a fit and will hear you out.

641
00:23:52.963 --> 00:23:55.815
<v ->I'll again, really emphasize this.</v>

642
00:23:55.815 --> 00:23:57.073
Kaiser, to me, is the model

643
00:23:57.073 --> 00:23:59.676
of future medicine in this country.

644
00:23:59.676 --> 00:24:01.894
20 or 30 years ago, Kaiser was looked down upon

645
00:24:01.894 --> 00:24:05.436
because it was the default mechanism

646
00:24:05.436 --> 00:24:08.586
for large insurers or large employers.

647
00:24:08.586 --> 00:24:12.248
The physicians who went to Kaiser 30 years or so ago,

648
00:24:12.248 --> 00:24:13.507
did it because they just didn't

649
00:24:13.507 --> 00:24:15.155
want to be in a general practice.

650
00:24:15.155 --> 00:24:16.649
Now, the new generation,

651
00:24:16.649 --> 00:24:18.825
the best docs are going to Kaiser.

652
00:24:18.825 --> 00:24:21.086
It's phenomenal to see.

653
00:24:21.086 --> 00:24:23.710
In addition to that, Kaiser has support structure

654
00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:25.672
around those physicians that's massive,

655
00:24:25.672 --> 00:24:27.827
as you are alluding to.

656
00:24:27.827 --> 00:24:30.472
By the way, for your viewers,

657
00:24:30.472 --> 00:24:33.331
Kaiser's health educational website

658
00:24:33.331 --> 00:24:35.422
is available free to anybody.

659
00:24:35.422 --> 00:24:37.086
I believe you go to kp.org,

660
00:24:37.086 --> 00:24:38.207
but I'm not 100% sure about that.

661
00:24:38.207 --> 00:24:40.276
<v Regina>Yes, I think it is kp.org.</v>

662
00:24:40.276 --> 00:24:42.486
<v ->And they have an incredible network</v>

663
00:24:42.486 --> 00:24:46.262
of information, video, educational materials for managing

664
00:24:46.262 --> 00:24:48.873
things like high blood pressure or diabetes.

665
00:24:48.873 --> 00:24:50.174
It's available to the general public.

666
00:24:50.174 --> 00:24:52.948
Kaiser's been wonderfully generous in doing that.

667
00:24:52.948 --> 00:24:55.379
In addition to that, Kaiser has nutritionists

668
00:24:55.379 --> 00:24:58.195
and exercise physiologists, therapists,

669
00:24:58.195 --> 00:25:00.073
that are available to their patients,

670
00:25:00.073 --> 00:25:02.206
to provide the full plethora of care.

671
00:25:02.206 --> 00:25:03.699
And in addition to that,

672
00:25:03.699 --> 00:25:05.747
those caregivers actually work well together

673
00:25:05.747 --> 00:25:07.667
and communicate well together.

674
00:25:07.667 --> 00:25:09.779
It's phenomenal to watch.

675
00:25:09.779 --> 00:25:11.593
The great things about Kaiser today

676
00:25:11.593 --> 00:25:14.511
is that your physician is actually available by email.

677
00:25:14.511 --> 00:25:16.047
You can email your doc with a question,

678
00:25:16.047 --> 00:25:18.692
your doc will respond with that question.

679
00:25:18.692 --> 00:25:21.871
It's those quick, in-the-moment questions

680
00:25:21.871 --> 00:25:23.146
that have a lot more value,

681
00:25:23.146 --> 00:25:24.741
and frankly, save office visits.

682
00:25:24.741 --> 00:25:27.600
So it's cost-effective to do it that way.

683
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.840
The other piece about Kaiser that I absolutely love,

684
00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.670
my background is in cardiovascular prevention,

685
00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:33.632
heart disease prevention,

686
00:25:33.632 --> 00:25:36.337
if you look at their heart-disease prevention statistics,

687
00:25:36.337 --> 00:25:37.937
they're about twice as good

688
00:25:37.937 --> 00:25:39.625
as any other system in this country.

689
00:25:39.625 --> 00:25:40.616
So when you look

690
00:25:40.616 --> 00:25:43.060
at population-based health management,

691
00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:46.175
they are by and large the best.

692
00:25:46.175 --> 00:25:49.438
So, it may sound, and I'm not an employee of Kaiser,

693
00:25:49.438 --> 00:25:51.636
I'm not being paid for these statements,

694
00:25:51.636 --> 00:25:52.349
and I do get to work

695
00:25:52.349 --> 00:25:54.760
with every health company or group in this country.

696
00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.394
<v Regina>It's good to know that there's a model</v>

697
00:25:56.394 --> 00:25:58.279
that you see holds some value for our future.

698
00:25:58.279 --> 00:25:59.333
<v ->It's truly effective,</v>

699
00:25:59.333 --> 00:26:01.717
and because it's what's called an integrated model,

700
00:26:01.717 --> 00:26:04.142
not integrative, but an integrated model,

701
00:26:04.142 --> 00:26:06.622
meaning that the clinicians from all different walks,

702
00:26:06.622 --> 00:26:07.966
from all different trainings,

703
00:26:07.966 --> 00:26:09.630
communicate well with each other,

704
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:11.982
that they are integrated in their care of delivery,

705
00:26:11.982 --> 00:26:13.561
as opposed to integrative,

706
00:26:13.561 --> 00:26:15.395
which is more the alternative medicine.

707
00:26:15.395 --> 00:26:16.888
And in some Kaiser environments,

708
00:26:16.888 --> 00:26:19.726
that's actually available now as well.

709
00:26:19.726 --> 00:26:21.752
So there's a nice model for that

710
00:26:21.752 --> 00:26:24.056
growing within the Kaiser system.

711
00:26:24.056 --> 00:26:26.799
<v Regina>Any final comments, both to help us</v>

712
00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:29.700
have more compassion for the medical industry

713
00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.791
and to give people hope

714
00:26:31.791 --> 00:26:34.884
that really, the medical industry isn't dead,

715
00:26:34.884 --> 00:26:36.740
maybe just this incarnation,

716
00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.937
that is too closely-linked, perhaps,

717
00:26:38.937 --> 00:26:42.606
to the current pharmaceutical model that might be dead,

718
00:26:42.606 --> 00:26:46.170
or not offering as much as it could to us.

719
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:49.280
<v ->First, the answer to the first part of the question,</v>

720
00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.477
physicians are good people.

721
00:26:51.477 --> 00:26:53.269
They're good-hearted.

722
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:57.757
99.9% of them go into medicine because they want to serve.

723
00:26:57.757 --> 00:26:59.257
Okay?

724
00:26:59.257 --> 00:27:01.981
The other 0.1% go in because they love science,

725
00:27:01.981 --> 00:27:03.731
which is not a bad thing either, you know,

726
00:27:03.731 --> 00:27:07.278
it serves the population in general.

727
00:27:07.278 --> 00:27:08.942
They are struggling and suffering

728
00:27:08.942 --> 00:27:11.652
because of the existing system of medicine,

729
00:27:11.652 --> 00:27:12.995
and they're struggling and suffering

730
00:27:12.995 --> 00:27:15.768
because of the personality that's attracted to medicine:

731
00:27:15.768 --> 00:27:20.043
perfectionist, obsessive-compulsive, driven, Type A.

732
00:27:20.043 --> 00:27:22.027
So in many ways, they're really good people

733
00:27:22.027 --> 00:27:24.139
who are just struggling.

734
00:27:24.139 --> 00:27:26.614
This is why I've dedicated my life's work

735
00:27:26.614 --> 00:27:30.347
to help them through those struggles.

736
00:27:30.347 --> 00:27:32.993
So, have empathy, have compassion for them.

737
00:27:32.993 --> 00:27:35.121
They really are good people, they're just trying.

738
00:27:35.121 --> 00:27:38.444
And some are quirky, you know, as in any profession.

739
00:27:38.444 --> 00:27:40.599
In addition to that, my hopefulness

740
00:27:40.599 --> 00:27:44.311
in looking at the new generation of physicians coming out

741
00:27:44.311 --> 00:27:46.551
is phenomenal, I love them.

742
00:27:46.551 --> 00:27:49.969
They're sweet, wonderful, dedicated, excited.

743
00:27:49.969 --> 00:27:51.875
They know they're gonna have huge debt,

744
00:27:51.875 --> 00:27:53.560
and they're willing to struggle with that

745
00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.654
to do good work for a community.

746
00:27:56.654 --> 00:27:58.808
So I'm delighted there.

747
00:27:58.808 --> 00:28:02.307
And then on top of that, there is no "alternative" anymore.

748
00:28:02.307 --> 00:28:04.227
It's just medicine.

749
00:28:04.227 --> 00:28:07.704
And whatever we can do to help the population do better,

750
00:28:07.704 --> 00:28:10.285
whatever we can do to help the individual

751
00:28:10.285 --> 00:28:12.461
have a better life, a healthier life,

752
00:28:12.461 --> 00:28:14.589
however we can improve their vitality,

753
00:28:14.589 --> 00:28:15.835
that's really the mission.

754
00:28:15.835 --> 00:28:17.222
If I can diverge just for a second,

755
00:28:17.222 --> 00:28:18.715
my wife, who's also a physician,

756
00:28:18.715 --> 00:28:19.995
once told me over dinner

757
00:28:19.995 --> 00:28:21.949
that the two healthiest people in her practice

758
00:28:21.949 --> 00:28:24.579
are two women who are dying of cancer.

759
00:28:24.579 --> 00:28:26.435
And when I start to look at that statement,

760
00:28:26.435 --> 00:28:28.120
to me that's a beautiful statement.

761
00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.104
And in many ways, as a researcher,

762
00:28:30.104 --> 00:28:33.176
I'm very interested in studying what that means.

763
00:28:33.176 --> 00:28:34.032
What is health?

764
00:28:34.032 --> 00:28:35.398
What's vitality?

765
00:28:35.398 --> 00:28:38.417
These are the questions that are starting to be asked.

766
00:28:38.417 --> 00:28:41.020
And I'm gonna be ridiculousy simple about this,

767
00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:44.070
in this statement, but I really, truly believe it.

768
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:48.059
About a year ago, I woke up, because of my wife's statement,

769
00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:50.982
to this concept of happiness medicine,

770
00:28:50.982 --> 00:28:53.030
because when people are happy in their lives,

771
00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:54.502
they smoke less.

772
00:28:54.502 --> 00:28:56.017
When people are happy in their lives,

773
00:28:56.017 --> 00:28:57.425
they're more physically active.

774
00:28:57.425 --> 00:28:58.939
When people are happy in their lives,

775
00:28:58.939 --> 00:29:01.521
they connect and relate to other people better.

776
00:29:01.521 --> 00:29:03.590
They eat more healthfully.

777
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:05.361
So what's happiness,

778
00:29:05.361 --> 00:29:06.832
and how does that relate to health?

779
00:29:06.832 --> 00:29:09.051
And this is just a very personal mission of mine.

780
00:29:09.051 --> 00:29:10.438
I'm really interested in researching,

781
00:29:10.438 --> 00:29:12.528
studying that question.

782
00:29:12.528 --> 00:29:14.752
And although I'll be nonspecific about this,

783
00:29:14.752 --> 00:29:15.836
a very good friend of mine

784
00:29:15.836 --> 00:29:17.415
at the National Institute of Health

785
00:29:17.415 --> 00:29:19.612
is very interested in researching that question,

786
00:29:19.612 --> 00:29:22.513
the concept of happiness and "What is health?"

787
00:29:22.513 --> 00:29:25.009
as opposed to, "How do we treat disease?"

788
00:29:25.009 --> 00:29:27.057
Because my view of medicine in the future

789
00:29:27.057 --> 00:29:30.364
is that the goal is gonna be happiness and vitality,

790
00:29:30.364 --> 00:29:32.860
not treatment of health disorders.

791
00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:36.188
And to me, that's a beautiful way to do medicine,

792
00:29:36.188 --> 00:29:39.409
that we shift the paradigm to well-being,

793
00:29:39.409 --> 00:29:41.372
we shift the paradigm to happiness.

794
00:29:41.372 --> 00:29:43.377
And we manage diseases when they show up,

795
00:29:43.377 --> 00:29:45.147
but it's not the main goal,

796
00:29:45.147 --> 00:29:48.838
it's not the main interest of the physician or the patient.

797
00:29:48.838 --> 00:29:50.097
<v Regina>Beautifully stated,</v>

798
00:29:50.097 --> 00:29:53.531
and I hope that a lot of people feel a renewed,

799
00:29:53.531 --> 00:29:56.866
at least respect, for what the medical doctor is up against

800
00:29:56.866 --> 00:29:59.234
and what our future potentials are

801
00:29:59.234 --> 00:30:00.749
and take on the responsibility

802
00:30:00.749 --> 00:30:02.926
that you've said is ours to begin with.

803
00:30:02.926 --> 00:30:04.655
I very much appreciate you taking the time

804
00:30:04.655 --> 00:30:06.239
to explain all of this to us.

805
00:30:06.239 --> 00:30:08.047
<v ->Yeah, and Regina, I really appreciate</v>

806
00:30:08.047 --> 00:30:09.177
the work that you do,

807
00:30:09.177 --> 00:30:12.422
and I appreciate those who are listening, watching this,

808
00:30:12.422 --> 00:30:15.409
because these are people who are interested in health.

809
00:30:15.409 --> 00:30:17.542
And the best thing for a physician is to sit

810
00:30:17.542 --> 00:30:20.304
across from someone who's interested in their own health.

811
00:30:21.324 --> 00:30:22.650
<v ->If you're in the field of medicine</v>

812
00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:24.613
and feel that you need some support,

813
00:30:24.613 --> 00:30:26.597
please visit Dr. Lipsenthal's website

814
00:30:26.597 --> 00:30:29.370
at findingbalanceprograms.com.

815
00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:30.522
For the rest of us,

816
00:30:30.522 --> 00:30:32.783
perhaps this interview sparked some compassion

817
00:30:32.783 --> 00:30:35.045
for a highly-stressed group of people.

818
00:30:35.045 --> 00:30:38.373
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

819
00:30:40.003 --> 00:30:45.003
(gentle music)
