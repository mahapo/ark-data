00:00:01.151 --> 00:00:03.790
<v ->Robert Bauval has his feet in two worlds:</v>

2
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.029
in the west in the modern work of academia, and in Egypt,

3
00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.095
where he has spent nearly half of his fascinating life.

4
00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:12.135
Robert's work on the dating of the Sphinx

5
00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:14.099
has been featured in a number of documentaries

6
00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.401
and news programs, shocking the world with his findings

7
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:19.741
as to its truer age, which may reach back

8
00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:23.060
to 11,500 BC or even more.

9
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.709
But his passion is in understanding the connection

10
00:00:25.709 --> 00:00:28.356
between the cosmos and this mystical site

11
00:00:28.356 --> 00:00:30.910
for a deeper understanding of what the ancients knew

12
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.884
to be mankind's destiny.

13
00:00:32.884 --> 00:00:34.857
To share this knowledge, he takes city dwellers

14
00:00:34.857 --> 00:00:39.193
to Egypt to, among other things, witness the desert sunrise.

15
00:00:40.155 --> 00:00:42.944 line:15%

16
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:49.173
<v Woman>One of the comments you made</v>

17
00:00:49.173 --> 00:00:51.378
in your talk a little while ago

18
00:00:51.378 --> 00:00:53.271
was about the fact that modern man

19
00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:55.268
has completely forgotten about

20
00:00:55.268 --> 00:00:57.149
at least 50% of our environment,

21
00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.517
which is what is above our heads.

22
00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:03.209
We've become completely disconnected from

23
00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:06.622
that sense of continuity and also the patterns

24
00:01:06.622 --> 00:01:10.732
of civilizations rising and falling and so forth.

25
00:01:10.732 --> 00:01:12.160
So, I wanted to jump in at that point

26
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.577
and talk about where we--

27
00:01:15.577 --> 00:01:19.173
first of all, why this is not a good thing to have forgotten

28
00:01:19.173 --> 00:01:21.634
and then where we were with your work,

29
00:01:21.634 --> 00:01:23.840
some of the societies, some of the newest work

30
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.976
you've done in Sirius Rising, and then

31
00:01:25.976 --> 00:01:28.472
start taking the conversation forward to now.

32
00:01:28.472 --> 00:01:30.945
First of all, what's up with our having forgotten

33
00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:34.040
everything above our heads and our connection to it?

34
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.853
<v ->I think perhaps the term "forgotten"</v>

35
00:01:37.853 --> 00:01:40.302
is not quite accurate.

36
00:01:43.272 --> 00:01:46.989
We today, I mean us living human beings,

37
00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.877
have to be caught in a time frame,

38
00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:54.589
which is the 20th and 21st century.

39
00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:57.940
We process within that culture.

40
00:01:59.738 --> 00:02:04.478
We believe that we are

41
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.744
living in the reality

42
00:02:08.757 --> 00:02:11.538
that is our reality, whereas in fact,

43
00:02:11.538 --> 00:02:13.802
we could have been born at any time.

44
00:02:14.957 --> 00:02:16.931
We could have been born at the time

45
00:02:16.931 --> 00:02:17.987
of the ancient Egyptians,

46
00:02:17.987 --> 00:02:20.770
we could have been born in prehistoric times,

47
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.198
or we could be born in the future.

48
00:02:23.966 --> 00:02:27.722
We respond to and we process within our own time frame.

49
00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:30.555
The question is, which is the right response?

50
00:02:30.607 --> 00:02:32.639
How are we supposed to behave,

51
00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.335
and what are we supposed to do on this planet?

52
00:02:36.145 --> 00:02:37.951
Why this planet?

53
00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:41.475
We could even argue that not only we're born

54
00:02:41.475 --> 00:02:45.228
in a certain time frame, but we're born in specific place.

55
00:02:47.363 --> 00:02:49.967
We could have been born somewhere entirely different.

56
00:02:49.967 --> 00:02:53.076
We're here for presumably a reason.

57
00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:56.113
The way I see it is that

58
00:02:56.373 --> 00:03:00.847
we're on this planet to understand

59
00:03:02.017 --> 00:03:06.037
its role in the cosmic family.

60
00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:10.094
For all we know, and this is

61
00:03:10.094 --> 00:03:11.794
perhaps the most exciting thing,

62
00:03:11.794 --> 00:03:13.510
for all we know, we're the only

63
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.474
conscious entity in this cosmos,

64
00:03:17.474 --> 00:03:19.050
which I believe we're not,

65
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.209
but for all we know we might be,

66
00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.870
and we have a tremendous responsibility.

67
00:03:26.697 --> 00:03:29.068
We are matter become conscious.

68
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.585
We are conscious stars, if you like.

69
00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:36.651
We come from the stars, it's a physical reality,

70
00:03:37.037 --> 00:03:38.976
and we've become conscious.

71
00:03:40.044 --> 00:03:42.024
What do we do with this consciousness?

72
00:03:42.598 --> 00:03:47.598
Do we restrain it, and live within

73
00:03:47.835 --> 00:03:51.685
the cultural ethos that we exist?

74
00:03:51.685 --> 00:03:55.589
Or do we step out of it and realign ourselves

75
00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:59.914
with the true purpose of our existence here?

76
00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:02.632
The question is, what is this?

77
00:04:02.632 --> 00:04:05.238
I think the first thing that I feel,

78
00:04:05.238 --> 00:04:09.112
that we all ought to do, is to attempt to reconnect.

79
00:04:09.707 --> 00:04:11.646
For example, I take tours in Egypt

80
00:04:11.646 --> 00:04:15.530
as a side line to my writing,

81
00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:17.944
and something very odd happens.

82
00:04:17.944 --> 00:04:21.085
I get people from all over walks of life,

83
00:04:21.085 --> 00:04:23.586
accountants, bankers,

84
00:04:24.286 --> 00:04:28.135
searchers, teachers, from everywhere.

85
00:04:28.756 --> 00:04:32.332
What strikes me is that as I take them around Egypt--

86
00:04:32.332 --> 00:04:36.494
Egypt has a wonderful context--is that

87
00:04:37.524 --> 00:04:41.847
much of its population live in

88
00:04:42.777 --> 00:04:45.218
what we would call a primitive condition.

89
00:04:45.445 --> 00:04:47.547
I mean if you travel around outside Cairo,

90
00:04:47.547 --> 00:04:50.345
you find people living in a manner

91
00:04:50.345 --> 00:04:54.101
that has been unchanged for thousands of years.

92
00:04:54.385 --> 00:04:55.738
Very close to the--

93
00:04:55.813 --> 00:04:56.939
<v Woman>And you were born in Egypt</v>

94
00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:58.146
You know Egypt well.
<v ->I was born in Egypt, yes.</v>

95
00:04:58.146 --> 00:04:59.496
<v Woman>You have a foot in both worlds.</v>

96
00:04:59.496 --> 00:05:02.419
<v ->Yes, well I suppose I have the advantage of having lived--</v>

97
00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:03.662
I'm 60 years old, and I've lived

98
00:05:03.662 --> 00:05:06.019
literally half my life in the west

99
00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:09.914
and half my life in the east, and particularly Egypt.

100
00:05:10.303 --> 00:05:13.245
Collectively, I've spent 35 years in Egypt.

101
00:05:14.805 --> 00:05:18.393
In Egypt, especially if you live outside the cities,

102
00:05:19.213 --> 00:05:22.725
you are constantly

103
00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:28.799
integrated in the activity of nature.

104
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.799
You rise with sunrise, you see the sunset.

105
00:05:34.623 --> 00:05:36.358
Particularly the neurotic people,

106
00:05:36.358 --> 00:05:39.271
you're very conscious of, for example, directions.

107
00:05:39.271 --> 00:05:41.742
Nine floors from north to south.

108
00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.543
It's inbred in you; you know where

109
00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:45.810
North is, East is, and West is.

110
00:05:46.531 --> 00:05:48.580
You know where the sun will rise.

111
00:05:48.876 --> 00:05:50.524
You know where it will set.

112
00:05:50.524 --> 00:05:52.156
You know which stars are going to appear.

113
00:05:52.173 --> 00:05:56.939
You're literally exposed

114
00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:59.797
to the natural context around you.

115
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:02.734
Now when I find these people who come over,

116
00:06:03.018 --> 00:06:06.565
as amazing as it may sound, city people--

117
00:06:07.442 --> 00:06:10.536
I get a lot of them from London, from Rome--

118
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.165
some of them, as odd as it may seem,

119
00:06:13.165 --> 00:06:14.646
have never seen the sun rise.

120
00:06:14.906 --> 00:06:17.199
<v Woman>Now that is amazing.</v>

121
00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:21.362
<v ->What happens once we tour, and I take them gently around</v>

122
00:06:22.212 --> 00:06:23.835
a place I take them very often

123
00:06:23.835 --> 00:06:26.163
to experience this is an oasis.

124
00:06:26.702 --> 00:06:29.106
An oasis is something very special

125
00:06:29.106 --> 00:06:31.579
because it's a kind of microcosm,

126
00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:33.750
it's a little world.

127
00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:37.771
There is one particular which there is of Siwa

128
00:06:38.111 --> 00:06:40.651
which has a very special temple,

129
00:06:40.651 --> 00:06:43.246
it's the oracle temple of Alexander the Great.

130
00:06:43.661 --> 00:06:45.898
It was a very, very important

131
00:06:45.898 --> 00:06:48.581
spiritual place in ancient times.

132
00:06:48.581 --> 00:06:49.695
Alexander the Great went there

133
00:06:49.695 --> 00:06:52.798
to check his divinity, for example.

134
00:06:53.096 --> 00:06:55.448
The temple still exists; it's on a mound.

135
00:06:55.802 --> 00:06:58.822
As you go on that mound, you literally see

136
00:06:58.822 --> 00:07:02.286
the world in a miniature form.

137
00:07:02.744 --> 00:07:06.609
The oasis is circular, you see its limits,

138
00:07:06.609 --> 00:07:09.153
you know the directions, you're very, very

139
00:07:09.153 --> 00:07:13.304
aware of the environment you're in.

140
00:07:14.154 --> 00:07:18.694
And I take them there an hour or so before dawn,

141
00:07:19.264 --> 00:07:21.733
and I sit them on the mound,

142
00:07:22.296 --> 00:07:24.265
and tell them to wait for sunrise.

143
00:07:24.803 --> 00:07:25.999
<v Woman>We had to stop down</v>

144
00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:28.040
because it's so cold you had to put your jacket on.

145
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.286
<v ->Yeah, I'm freezing.</v>

146
00:07:29.286 --> 00:07:31.409
<v Woman>Okay, let's pick up with that.</v>

147
00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:36.077
<v ->Well, as they sit there and do what they think</v>

148
00:07:36.077 --> 00:07:38.050
is normal to do, they chit-chat among each other

149
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.351
and speak about what they're going to have

150
00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:41.410
for lunch or whatever,

151
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.609
and then I stop them, abruptly.

152
00:07:44.707 --> 00:07:48.062
"Could you all keep quiet?"

153
00:07:49.945 --> 00:07:51.704
They listen to me.

154
00:07:51.896 --> 00:07:54.927
And I said, "Just listen, listen what's gonna happen

155
00:07:54.927 --> 00:07:56.651
"and just feel what's gonna happen."

156
00:07:57.353 --> 00:08:00.999
And what happens there, and happens in similar conditions,

157
00:08:00.999 --> 00:08:05.462
is that, you can feel it, there's a shift.

158
00:08:06.002 --> 00:08:08.971
The palm trees begin to rustle.

159
00:08:11.209 --> 00:08:14.441
Certain creatures begin to make noises.

160
00:08:14.441 --> 00:08:17.355
We hear the cockerel

161
00:08:18.835 --> 00:08:22.059
chanting, donkeys begin to bray.

162
00:08:22.236 --> 00:08:25.914
It's as if they're responding to the change.

163
00:08:25.914 --> 00:08:27.997
They're actually, what I call,

164
00:08:27.997 --> 00:08:30.151
speaking the silent language of nature.

165
00:08:30.818 --> 00:08:32.449
They're talking to each other.

166
00:08:34.033 --> 00:08:39.033
Falcons appear, and at the moment of sunrise,

167
00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:42.766
there's a kind of natural orchestra.

168
00:08:42.766 --> 00:08:46.781
You hear the braying, and the cockerel singing,

169
00:08:47.751 --> 00:08:50.735
and falcons getting excited.

170
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:53.643
And what falcons do at dawn,

171
00:08:53.643 --> 00:08:57.306
they literally fly against the sun.

172
00:08:57.318 --> 00:08:58.624
<v Woman>Oh, is that right?</v>

173
00:08:58.624 --> 00:08:59.761
<v ->They literally fly against it,</v>

174
00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:02.364
and they open their wings,

175
00:09:02.364 --> 00:09:07.105
as if greeting, speaking to the sun.

176
00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.537
Some animals do not exist there anymore,

177
00:09:09.537 --> 00:09:11.499
but for example, when there were baboons,

178
00:09:11.499 --> 00:09:14.309
Egyptians were very reverent to the baboons.

179
00:09:14.659 --> 00:09:16.282
Why?

180
00:09:16.282 --> 00:09:19.080
Because they start chattering when the sun rise,

181
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.111
and they rush to the riverside, to the Nile,

182
00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:24.653
and they raise their hands by the falcons,

183
00:09:24.653 --> 00:09:28.717
and they seem to be speaking some language,

184
00:09:28.717 --> 00:09:33.541
which to me is the language of nature.

185
00:09:33.541 --> 00:09:37.147
We can speak it, too, if we try.

186
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.295
What we call literate man

187
00:09:41.295 --> 00:09:45.815
has only been literate man for the last 6-7,000 years.

188
00:09:45.815 --> 00:09:48.779
For millions, perhaps billions, of years,

189
00:09:48.779 --> 00:09:50.246
we spoke the language of nature.

190
00:09:50.246 --> 00:09:54.191
We understood the subtleties of nature.

191
00:09:54.911 --> 00:09:59.404
We could sense what animals

192
00:10:00.192 --> 00:10:02.459
were saying, in a sense.

193
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:05.718
It's a language that is silent.

194
00:10:06.833 --> 00:10:11.361
It's very strange, and very, very inspiring

195
00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:15.332
to see human beings who are still in this context

196
00:10:15.332 --> 00:10:18.958
The Bedouin, for example, in the desert, he'll sense,

197
00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:23.041
he'll tell you there's a falcon

198
00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:26.796
behind a tree, he senses it.

199
00:10:26.796 --> 00:10:30.759
I did a lot of trapping when I was a young kid in Egypt,

200
00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:32.422
and I learned from the Bedouins,

201
00:10:32.422 --> 00:10:35.194
they walk in the desert and tell you, "Dig here.

202
00:10:35.194 --> 00:10:38.598
"You're going to find a certain cockroach

203
00:10:38.598 --> 00:10:42.581
"which you can use as bait," and you find it.

204
00:10:43.335 --> 00:10:46.453
What is it that gets them to that?

205
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.163
It's this--
<v ->-[Woman] You made</v>

206
00:10:48.163 --> 00:10:50.278
a comment, in fact, that I was intrigued with,

207
00:10:50.278 --> 00:10:52.542
that fits perfectly right in this part.

208
00:10:52.542 --> 00:10:55.073
What you were saying, the Einsteins

209
00:10:55.073 --> 00:10:58.208
and the Newtons and such of our known history

210
00:10:58.208 --> 00:11:01.284
have always been, that genius has always existed,

211
00:11:01.284 --> 00:11:03.455
but before we had the scientific method

212
00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:05.382
in modern times and technology,

213
00:11:05.382 --> 00:11:08.977
it was applied to the internal technologies, as it were.

214
00:11:08.977 --> 00:11:13.463
<v ->And we come to this term that I call magic.</v>

215
00:11:14.062 --> 00:11:15.769
I don't mean pulling rabbits out of hats

216
00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:17.023
and things like that.
<v Woman>No,</v>

217
00:11:17.023 --> 00:11:18.033
real magic.

218
00:11:18.033 --> 00:11:22.926
<v ->The magic of once you understand</v>

219
00:11:22.926 --> 00:11:26.267
and study and observe nature around you,

220
00:11:27.507 --> 00:11:30.638
and I really mean in a very intense way.

221
00:11:30.638 --> 00:11:35.638
For example, a neophyte of the temples in Egypt

222
00:11:35.747 --> 00:11:37.754
will be given a task.

223
00:11:38.174 --> 00:11:42.363
You're going to study the hieroglyph

224
00:11:42.363 --> 00:11:46.298
that is a bird

225
00:11:46.298 --> 00:11:50.231
or a crocodile or a falcon.

226
00:11:50.231 --> 00:11:53.135
Now, we want you to go out there

227
00:11:53.135 --> 00:11:57.794
and observe that creature.

228
00:11:58.174 --> 00:12:01.419
Don't come back until you know everything it does.

229
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.576
How it eats, how it sleeps, how it

230
00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:11.768
hunts, how it behaves with other creatues,

231
00:12:11.768 --> 00:12:13.291
how it multiplies.

232
00:12:13.291 --> 00:12:16.165
Everything, everything that you can know,

233
00:12:17.018 --> 00:12:20.275
so that when you know it, you know

234
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.971
to its depth either

235
00:12:24.971 --> 00:12:29.406
this creature or this thing or the sun or the stars

236
00:12:29.406 --> 00:12:33.092
or whatever is being studied, by observation.

237
00:12:33.666 --> 00:12:35.803
We have all the capacity to observe

238
00:12:35.803 --> 00:12:39.081
not just with our eyes, but with our senses,

239
00:12:39.081 --> 00:12:43.824
to feel, to touch, so that we know everything.

240
00:12:43.824 --> 00:12:48.824
How it feels, how it smells,

241
00:12:49.292 --> 00:12:51.953
and then we can say we know this thing.

242
00:12:51.964 --> 00:12:53.728
I know it.

243
00:12:53.728 --> 00:12:54.657
<v Woman>That's knowledge.</v>

244
00:12:54.657 --> 00:12:58.300
<v ->Well, that is knowledge that will become magic</v>

245
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.462
because when you know the thing,

246
00:13:00.462 --> 00:13:02.610
then when you speak of the thing,

247
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.838
you're speaking what the Egyptians call the words of power.

248
00:13:05.838 --> 00:13:08.810
When you say the words of the thing or the creature

249
00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.248
that you have studied, then you utter it

250
00:13:11.248 --> 00:13:14.278
with such power that others can

251
00:13:14.278 --> 00:13:17.218
get the full depth of the message.

252
00:13:18.551 --> 00:13:20.843
To me, that is

253
00:13:23.193 --> 00:13:26.220
social man, conscious man

254
00:13:27.895 --> 00:13:32.895
living in full harmony with his environment.

255
00:13:34.199 --> 00:13:36.483
Then we become something else.

256
00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:40.515
We become literally, we expose

257
00:13:40.515 --> 00:13:44.220
and exploit our magical capacities.

258
00:13:44.636 --> 00:13:47.144
What I mean by that is that

259
00:13:47.144 --> 00:13:52.144
we forget that we are the product

260
00:13:52.554 --> 00:13:54.191
of billions of years of evolution

261
00:13:54.191 --> 00:13:58.557
on this planet alone, let alone the billions of years

262
00:13:58.557 --> 00:14:00.287
before this planet was formed.

263
00:14:00.287 --> 00:14:03.930
We are the fruit,

264
00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.590
we're a magical creation.

265
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.323
And yet, we're not using these capacities.

266
00:14:10.504 --> 00:14:11.410
<v Woman>But the evidence is</v>

267
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.173
that we, once upon a time, have used these capacities

268
00:14:14.173 --> 00:14:16.240
in the past.
<v ->We have them.</v>

269
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.014
The question is that we're caught in a time frame

270
00:14:19.014 --> 00:14:23.700
that does not demand us to use them.

271
00:14:24.281 --> 00:14:27.560
There is a wonderful story, for example of,

272
00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:31.919
again, this Hermetic text of the gods of wisdom

273
00:14:31.919 --> 00:14:35.025
represented by Hermes, thought to the ancient Egyptians,

274
00:14:35.025 --> 00:14:36.325
who comes to Pharaoh and says,

275
00:14:36.325 --> 00:14:38.101
"I brought another gift for you.

276
00:14:38.101 --> 00:14:40.098
"I brought the gift of astronomy

277
00:14:40.098 --> 00:14:41.689
"and the knowledge of the stars,

278
00:14:41.689 --> 00:14:44.638
"and the knowledge of architecture,

279
00:14:44.638 --> 00:14:47.203
"and husbandry and agriculture,

280
00:14:47.203 --> 00:14:49.603
"but I've got something really good for you now."

281
00:14:49.607 --> 00:14:50.570
And he says, "What is it?"

282
00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:54.768
And he says, "Well, I brought you the knowledge of writing."

283
00:14:55.498 --> 00:14:57.945
And the king says, "What is it?"

284
00:14:57.945 --> 00:15:01.515
And he says, "Well, let me show you,"

285
00:15:01.515 --> 00:15:04.328
and takes a pallet and says, "Say something"

286
00:15:04.328 --> 00:15:07.463
and scribbles it down in hieroglyphic language

287
00:15:07.463 --> 00:15:10.696
and says, "Your words are here."

288
00:15:10.696 --> 00:15:11.939
He says, "How?"

289
00:15:11.939 --> 00:15:16.297
He says, "Well, I'll tell them.

290
00:15:16.297 --> 00:15:19.215
"It says what you says, no?

291
00:15:19.215 --> 00:15:20.172
"And I'll bring my assistant,

292
00:15:20.172 --> 00:15:22.379
"and he'll tell you exactly the same thing.

293
00:15:22.379 --> 00:15:24.444
"I mean this is fantastic;

294
00:15:24.444 --> 00:15:28.024
we can record what you say,

295
00:15:28.024 --> 00:15:29.623
"and we can record what you do,

296
00:15:29.623 --> 00:15:33.126
"and we can record anything we want."

297
00:15:33.806 --> 00:15:38.668
And he expects the king to say, "Wow! This is the best."

298
00:15:38.978 --> 00:15:42.175
And the king says,

299
00:15:42.755 --> 00:15:45.031
"God of wisdom, thank you

300
00:15:45.031 --> 00:15:46.029
"for all the gifts you brought me,

301
00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:49.234
"but I'm not sure about this one.

302
00:15:49.234 --> 00:15:53.756
"I don't think I want that."

303
00:15:53.756 --> 00:15:55.445
And he says, "Why? Why?"

304
00:15:55.445 --> 00:16:00.445
And he says, "Because men will lose

305
00:16:01.413 --> 00:16:06.092
"their ability to memorize.

306
00:16:06.092 --> 00:16:10.765
"The greatest gift that our creator's given us is memory."

307
00:16:11.153 --> 00:16:16.153
Memory, we hold inside everything we see,

308
00:16:16.668 --> 00:16:20.697
everything we sense, and if we externalize it,

309
00:16:20.697 --> 00:16:23.205
they won't use that capacity.

310
00:16:23.205 --> 00:16:26.444
We have a wonderful

311
00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:28.844
brain that stores,

312
00:16:28.844 --> 00:16:31.948
I mean, as I'm looking at you now,

313
00:16:31.948 --> 00:16:34.234
I'm not just recording what I see,

314
00:16:34.234 --> 00:16:38.314
but I'm recording the wind,

315
00:16:38.314 --> 00:16:40.914
the temperature, the hues.

316
00:16:40.914 --> 00:16:45.704
Thousands of effects and sensations are being in me.

317
00:16:46.144 --> 00:16:48.468
And as they're stored in there,

318
00:16:48.468 --> 00:16:50.128
and I learn how to externalize them,

319
00:16:50.128 --> 00:16:52.439
bring them back to surface,

320
00:16:52.439 --> 00:16:56.796
not only I can remember properly, not just by reading.

321
00:16:57.106 --> 00:17:01.314
I remember and bring back the event

322
00:17:01.314 --> 00:17:05.163
in my mind, but with other memories

323
00:17:05.163 --> 00:17:09.812
as they integrate and react with each other.

324
00:17:09.812 --> 00:17:13.321
They create unique ideas. They create.

325
00:17:13.321 --> 00:17:18.321
Without using that capacity, men will become lazy.

326
00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:21.588
<v Woman>So the king was a wise man?</v>

327
00:17:21.588 --> 00:17:25.244
<v ->The king was wiser than the god of wisdom.</v>

328
00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:28.430
Unfortunately, we did take writing.

329
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.079
If you really think about it, we're now at the stage

330
00:17:30.079 --> 00:17:33.361
where even writing has become archaic.

331
00:17:34.005 --> 00:17:37.369
We discharge all our capacities of memory

332
00:17:38.319 --> 00:17:40.481
and even our thinking into

333
00:17:40.481 --> 00:17:42.954
even much more powerful memory devices:

334
00:17:42.954 --> 00:17:46.304
computers, cell phones.

335
00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.562
<v Woman>But in this process,</v>

336
00:17:48.562 --> 00:17:50.584
we have cut ourselves off,

337
00:17:51.017 --> 00:17:55.298
to a tragic degree, from life.

338
00:17:55.298 --> 00:17:57.199
From each other, from nature.
<v ->Well, we're not choosing</v>

339
00:17:57.199 --> 00:18:00.085
our capacities, we are capable

340
00:18:00.085 --> 00:18:03.684
of understanding nature through our senses.

341
00:18:04.305 --> 00:18:05.907
<v Woman>What is the net effect of this,</v>

342
00:18:05.907 --> 00:18:07.052
as you see it?
<v ->The effect is</v>

343
00:18:07.052 --> 00:18:08.802
that we're detaching ourselves from nature,

344
00:18:08.802 --> 00:18:10.917
which is a very dangerous thing.

345
00:18:11.045 --> 00:18:13.344
The more we detach ourselves, the less respect

346
00:18:13.344 --> 00:18:17.176
we have for it, the less respect we have for others,

347
00:18:17.176 --> 00:18:19.538
and we isolate ourselves.

348
00:18:19.915 --> 00:18:21.740
We might as well not be on this planet.

349
00:18:21.982 --> 00:18:23.526
I mean, there are some people living on this planet

350
00:18:23.526 --> 00:18:25.964
who are so detached from it,

351
00:18:25.964 --> 00:18:29.012
living in ghettos and apartments.

352
00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:34.162
There are kids who have never seen cows.

353
00:18:34.162 --> 00:18:35.429
There are kids who have never seen

354
00:18:35.429 --> 00:18:38.339
the stars because light pollution.

355
00:18:38.339 --> 00:18:41.393
There are people who never witness

356
00:18:43.523 --> 00:18:45.929
a sunrise or a sunset like we were saying,

357
00:18:46.178 --> 00:18:48.546
have no idea how the stars move.

358
00:18:48.546 --> 00:18:50.439
They're detached from their environment.

359
00:18:50.439 --> 00:18:53.017
They're detached from the place

360
00:18:53.017 --> 00:18:55.327
which we are meant to be to understand it

361
00:18:55.327 --> 00:18:57.209
and know what we're here for.

362
00:18:57.209 --> 00:19:00.261
We're drifting; you might as well take me,

363
00:19:00.261 --> 00:19:02.687
or me, because I'm reconnecting,

364
00:19:02.687 --> 00:19:04.231
but you may as well take some human beings

365
00:19:04.231 --> 00:19:05.764
and place them on different parts of the cosmos,

366
00:19:05.764 --> 00:19:07.563
and it wouldn't make a difference.

367
00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:09.927
And yet, they're here for a reason.

368
00:19:09.927 --> 00:19:13.028
<v Woman>You've spent your life</v>

369
00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:15.844
trying to decipher, for example,

370
00:19:15.844 --> 00:19:19.780
the alignments of the great edifices, the Great Pyramid,

371
00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.649
against constellations, and you're renowned

372
00:19:21.649 --> 00:19:24.053
for the work you've done for original thinking,

373
00:19:24.053 --> 00:19:25.922
for almost heresy in some circles

374
00:19:25.922 --> 00:19:29.876
because you go against traditional, historical

375
00:19:29.876 --> 00:19:32.597
belief systems about Egypt and the cultures.

376
00:19:32.597 --> 00:19:37.137
And really, it's feeling to me like what's driving you

377
00:19:37.137 --> 00:19:41.073
is this desire to help people understand

378
00:19:41.073 --> 00:19:45.045
there are cycles of knowledge that have been

379
00:19:45.045 --> 00:19:46.641
and have been set aside and lost,

380
00:19:46.641 --> 00:19:48.046
and we have to regain them.

381
00:19:48.046 --> 00:19:49.790
Is this correct?

382
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.731
<v ->The way I see ancient Egypt, I see it as a model,</v>

383
00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:56.219
as the best model that we have available.

384
00:19:56.219 --> 00:19:59.644
We've tried models, we've tried monarchies,

385
00:19:59.644 --> 00:20:02.489
we've tried dictatorships, we've tried socialism,

386
00:20:02.489 --> 00:20:05.527
we've tried democracy, and they're not working.

387
00:20:06.123 --> 00:20:09.551
We need a model that works, and the model that works

388
00:20:09.551 --> 00:20:11.909
is a culture that has

389
00:20:14.689 --> 00:20:19.022
developed it's social, cultural behavior with nature.

390
00:20:19.771 --> 00:20:22.406
The Egyptians were acutely aware

391
00:20:22.406 --> 00:20:24.186
of their natural environments.

392
00:20:25.308 --> 00:20:29.754
They lived in accordance with the cycles of nature.

393
00:20:29.754 --> 00:20:31.184
<v Woman>Including the cosmos.</v>

394
00:20:31.184 --> 00:20:33.627
<v ->More particularly because they believed</v>

395
00:20:33.627 --> 00:20:37.221
that what was happening above was

396
00:20:37.221 --> 00:20:39.746
affecting their existence below.

397
00:20:40.321 --> 00:20:41.633
Which is correct.

398
00:20:41.633 --> 00:20:42.596
<v Woman>It would guide them,</v>

399
00:20:42.596 --> 00:20:44.714
as one talk with your newest work.

400
00:20:44.714 --> 00:20:46.265
In the cattle people, it would guide them

401
00:20:46.265 --> 00:20:48.576
to the understanding of when the rains would come,

402
00:20:48.576 --> 00:20:50.735
when the rains would recede, when they should start moving,

403
00:20:50.735 --> 00:20:52.674
when they should start flowing back.

404
00:20:52.674 --> 00:20:54.720
I mean, valuable information.

405
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:55.814
<v ->If I put you in the desert now,</v>

406
00:20:55.814 --> 00:20:57.293
you wouldn't know what to do.
<v Woman>No.</v>

407
00:20:57.293 --> 00:21:00.855
<v ->Whereas you put a person who was</v>

408
00:21:00.855 --> 00:21:04.888
initiated and experienced and learned and observed

409
00:21:04.888 --> 00:21:07.465
what was happening, he would know exactly what to do.

410
00:21:07.465 --> 00:21:10.347
I mean, I've been with Bedouins in Saudi Arabia,

411
00:21:13.147 --> 00:21:15.304
in an environment that is,

412
00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:17.968
that I really wouldn't know what to do.

413
00:21:17.968 --> 00:21:19.698
I wouldn't know which direction to go,

414
00:21:19.698 --> 00:21:23.085
I wouldn't know where to find water, these people know.

415
00:21:23.085 --> 00:21:26.090
And they know because they have studied and observed

416
00:21:26.339 --> 00:21:29.062
and integrated themselves with their environment.

417
00:21:29.346 --> 00:21:30.716
They're part of it.

418
00:21:30.716 --> 00:21:31.877
<v Woman>If our lives are disturbed,</v>

419
00:21:31.877 --> 00:21:34.478
our technological lives that we've laid out for ourselves

420
00:21:34.478 --> 00:21:35.848
where we're dependent on computers

421
00:21:35.848 --> 00:21:39.451
and supermarkets and freeways, were to come to pass

422
00:21:39.451 --> 00:21:42.159
for whatever cataclysmic reason or beyond,

423
00:21:42.159 --> 00:21:43.928
we would not be the ones that would be likely

424
00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:46.265
to survive very well, now would we?

425
00:21:46.265 --> 00:21:49.933
<v ->Well, yeah, but more troubling in all this</v>

426
00:21:49.933 --> 00:21:53.630
is that we're handing over

427
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:56.266
our capacities to machines.

428
00:21:56.266 --> 00:21:58.176
That's what it boils down to.

429
00:22:01.819 --> 00:22:03.884
If there are such thing as the gods,

430
00:22:03.884 --> 00:22:07.696
they must be extremely disappointed

431
00:22:07.696 --> 00:22:11.333
that having provided us

432
00:22:11.333 --> 00:22:13.443
with all these capacities we're

433
00:22:13.443 --> 00:22:14.408
not using them--
<v Woman>And the written word,</v>

434
00:22:14.408 --> 00:22:17.489
and the history passed down as well.

435
00:22:19.673 --> 00:22:22.911
<v ->It's a bit like, I see people driving Porsches</v>

436
00:22:22.911 --> 00:22:26.500
and Maseratis, whatever, in this particular area here,

437
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.370
and they're driving it to run by the newspapers

438
00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:31.225
or take their kids to school.

439
00:22:31.225 --> 00:22:35.996
The machine that they have is

440
00:22:35.996 --> 00:22:40.849
totally used without its full capacities.

441
00:22:41.514 --> 00:22:44.486
It's like people buy a digital camera today

442
00:22:44.486 --> 00:22:46.657
with 16 billion pixel whatever

443
00:22:46.657 --> 00:22:49.809
and all sorts of snapshots.

444
00:22:50.616 --> 00:22:53.333
Or you buy a computer that can

445
00:22:53.333 --> 00:22:56.102
perform all sorts of tasks just to write emails.

446
00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.232
Well, in a sense, we're the same.

447
00:22:58.232 --> 00:23:01.901
We have an amazing portfolio of capacities,

448
00:23:01.901 --> 00:23:04.176
and it is by using those capacities

449
00:23:04.176 --> 00:23:08.478
that we develop our internal selves

450
00:23:08.478 --> 00:23:11.540
and understand our presence and our existence better.

451
00:23:11.996 --> 00:23:16.732
We're not, and therefore, we're simply existing

452
00:23:16.732 --> 00:23:19.316
in a very low-capacity level.

453
00:23:19.316 --> 00:23:21.532
<v Woman>So turning to the</v>

454
00:23:21.532 --> 00:23:24.622
understandings of the Egyptian past, for example,

455
00:23:24.622 --> 00:23:26.723
and the knowledge that has been left for us,

456
00:23:26.723 --> 00:23:29.004
are you saying that this might be a way

457
00:23:29.004 --> 00:23:31.926
to find ourselves back to the future, so to speak?

458
00:23:32.125 --> 00:23:35.709
<v ->Yeah, I believe, one of things that I'm very interested</v>

459
00:23:35.709 --> 00:23:38.174
is not merely to find which small differences

460
00:23:38.174 --> 00:23:40.258
align to which star and so forth.

461
00:23:41.506 --> 00:23:45.667
I'm interested in how

462
00:23:47.644 --> 00:23:50.410
a civilization survived,

463
00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:54.117
in harmony with itself,

464
00:23:54.117 --> 00:23:55.747
with its environment

465
00:23:55.747 --> 00:23:59.625
for 3,000 years until we came and spoiled it.

466
00:24:00.659 --> 00:24:04.021
We have a model that worked, that's what I'm saying,

467
00:24:04.021 --> 00:24:07.406
and we should study it, we should understand why it did so.

468
00:24:07.406 --> 00:24:12.406
And it isn't just the ability to integrate

469
00:24:12.838 --> 00:24:15.476
and live in accordance with the natural environment.

470
00:24:15.476 --> 00:24:17.946
It developed a form of consciousness,

471
00:24:17.946 --> 00:24:22.010
an amazing respect because of its awareness

472
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:25.509
and its dependency, interdependency of its environment.

473
00:24:25.527 --> 00:24:29.176
For example, it would have been utterly

474
00:24:29.176 --> 00:24:33.260
unthinkable, sacrilege, for the ancient Egyptians

475
00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:36.687
to build a dam on the Nile, which we have done.

476
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.056
By doing that, in order to have

477
00:24:40.056 --> 00:24:43.136
cheaper energy and so forth,

478
00:24:43.136 --> 00:24:47.598
we've disturbed an ecology that

479
00:24:47.598 --> 00:24:50.730
had been in perfect harmony

480
00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:52.981
and people live in perfect harmony with it.

481
00:24:52.981 --> 00:24:57.981
We disturb the cycles of agriculture.

482
00:24:58.189 --> 00:25:01.026
We no longer have natural fertilizers coming from the flood.

483
00:25:01.026 --> 00:25:04.382
We disturbed the ecology of the fauna.

484
00:25:04.382 --> 00:25:07.269
We disturbed even the ecology of the nearby Mediterranean,

485
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:10.598
which depended on the plankton from the flood of the Nile.

486
00:25:11.548 --> 00:25:15.542
We tampered with nature, we tampered with the powers to be.

487
00:25:15.542 --> 00:25:18.621
Writing's about this: the pharaoh would,

488
00:25:18.621 --> 00:25:20.914
on his crown, on his coronation day,

489
00:25:20.914 --> 00:25:23.901
would take an oath, and he would

490
00:25:24.141 --> 00:25:29.141
the oath would include not to change what he called

491
00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:33.436
the Law of Maat, which we translate as the cosmic order.

492
00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:37.888
In short, he was not to tamper with anything

493
00:25:37.888 --> 00:25:41.788
that was nature orientated.

494
00:25:41.801 --> 00:25:45.224
Not to change the course of the Nile, not to

495
00:25:45.224 --> 00:25:49.372
move hills or whatever.

496
00:25:50.104 --> 00:25:52.611
The other is that he was not going to change the calendar,

497
00:25:52.611 --> 00:25:56.244
what we call the calendar, which to them was

498
00:25:56.244 --> 00:26:00.626
the machine of cosmic cycles, the cosmic order.

499
00:26:01.711 --> 00:26:03.482
This is very interesting because

500
00:26:04.842 --> 00:26:08.537
we live in a environment that is cyclical:

501
00:26:11.427 --> 00:26:16.168
vegetation, life, tides, floods,

502
00:26:16.168 --> 00:26:19.468
all these are cyclical and they're

503
00:26:19.468 --> 00:26:23.599
purely the result of the way this planet moves.

504
00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:27.594
Planet rotates on its axis, it goes around the sun

505
00:26:27.594 --> 00:26:29.707
in a cycle, and it has this wobble

506
00:26:29.707 --> 00:26:30.776
which we call procession.

507
00:26:30.776 --> 00:26:34.184
Because of this, we're in a cyclical environment,

508
00:26:34.514 --> 00:26:37.043
and things return back to the point of origin.

509
00:26:37.521 --> 00:26:42.504
So by not altering a calendrical system,

510
00:26:42.904 --> 00:26:46.113
they believe that the order always return

511
00:26:46.113 --> 00:26:50.233
back to its point of origin, whereas we

512
00:26:50.233 --> 00:26:54.170
form calendars, and by doing so we created

513
00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:57.862
what depression were on in the near time frame,

514
00:26:57.862 --> 00:27:00.717
we're moving forward to god-knows-where,

515
00:27:00.717 --> 00:27:02.069
which isn't true.
<v Woman>Rather than</v>

516
00:27:02.069 --> 00:27:03.833
circular.
<v ->Rather than circular</v>

517
00:27:03.833 --> 00:27:05.675
And the result is that we have created

518
00:27:05.675 --> 00:27:08.725
this notion of progress, that we're going ahead

519
00:27:08.725 --> 00:27:11.772
and we have to change things and we have to order things

520
00:27:11.772 --> 00:27:14.625
to quote-unquote "get better."

521
00:27:14.974 --> 00:27:18.341
But the result of this is that

522
00:27:18.341 --> 00:27:21.801
to get better as we perceive it, to improve things,

523
00:27:21.801 --> 00:27:26.503
to make machines faster, to have cell phones that are more--

524
00:27:26.503 --> 00:27:27.641
<v Woman>More ring tones.</v>

525
00:27:27.641 --> 00:27:29.389
<v ->More ring tones, whatever.</v>

526
00:27:31.221 --> 00:27:35.505
We grow all this from our natural environment.

527
00:27:35.505 --> 00:27:37.409
For every cell phone that you have,

528
00:27:37.409 --> 00:27:40.868
it is taken literally from the earth

529
00:27:40.868 --> 00:27:42.942
to make the thing.

530
00:27:44.724 --> 00:27:49.306
We're eating up our planet, in simple terms.

531
00:27:49.306 --> 00:27:51.829
Whereas by thinking in cyclical terms

532
00:27:51.829 --> 00:27:54.667
where we are not moving ahead, we're staying

533
00:27:54.667 --> 00:27:57.704
within a cycle, and our job is

534
00:27:57.704 --> 00:28:00.002
to stay in harmony with that cycle.

535
00:28:00.002 --> 00:28:01.500
Which is true, that's what we are.

536
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:05.169
We're cyclical creatures, we live, we get bored, we die.

537
00:28:05.169 --> 00:28:07.142
We hope to get reborn again, we don't know.

538
00:28:07.142 --> 00:28:10.579
But we are in that cyclical world.

539
00:28:10.579 --> 00:28:15.579
Then our mental process is geared

540
00:28:15.581 --> 00:28:19.758
to think this way, and we let things be.

541
00:28:20.335 --> 00:28:21.992
<v Woman>You're at a point where</v>

542
00:28:21.992 --> 00:28:23.455
you're tired of trying to create dialogue

543
00:28:23.455 --> 00:28:26.609
with the classic Egyptologists; they're not listening.

544
00:28:26.609 --> 00:28:28.496
The world of science, classic science,

545
00:28:28.496 --> 00:28:31.077
isn't listening, and you're ready to...?

546
00:28:31.171 --> 00:28:32.657
<v ->Well, there's a problem.</v>

547
00:28:32.657 --> 00:28:35.698
The problem is that, in particular with Egyptology,

548
00:28:35.698 --> 00:28:37.870
is that they have formulated their views

549
00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:42.805
on what ancient Egypt is, and it's so ingrained

550
00:28:46.975 --> 00:28:51.240
in their profession that literally

551
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:54.801
it's so hard to alter anything that is established.

552
00:28:55.122 --> 00:28:57.441
Like I was saying in the conference,

553
00:28:57.441 --> 00:28:59.255
it's taken months to decide whether

554
00:28:59.255 --> 00:29:01.394
to call something a door or not.

555
00:29:01.394 --> 00:29:03.594
<v Woman>So you can't function in that field,</v>

556
00:29:03.594 --> 00:29:05.464
you're trying to make some progress here.

557
00:29:05.464 --> 00:29:06.972
<v ->Well, we've gotta move.</v>

558
00:29:06.972 --> 00:29:09.806
For example, one of the things that has

559
00:29:09.806 --> 00:29:12.988
been a sore point for the last 30 or 40 years is

560
00:29:12.988 --> 00:29:15.631
the so-called star shafts in the Great Pyramid.

561
00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:19.976
Now, I would say that it took about 30 years

562
00:29:19.976 --> 00:29:22.077
to finally get Egyptologists, or at least

563
00:29:22.077 --> 00:29:24.016
a great part of Egyptologists to

564
00:29:24.016 --> 00:29:26.658
recognize them as star shafts.

565
00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:31.354
But even then we still have a hardcore

566
00:29:31.354 --> 00:29:32.991
who keeps on insisting that they're

567
00:29:32.991 --> 00:29:35.255
ventilation and so forth.

568
00:29:35.255 --> 00:29:37.670
The entry that I was mentioning earlier,

569
00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:41.826
there's an encyclopedia being prepared in archeoastronomy.

570
00:29:41.826 --> 00:29:43.363
It's the very first of its kind.

571
00:29:43.363 --> 00:29:44.462
<v Woman>Explain that again.</v>

572
00:29:44.462 --> 00:29:46.527
I think we were off camera when you were talking about it.

573
00:29:48.817 --> 00:29:51.148
<v ->The Supreme Council of Antiquities</v>

574
00:29:51.148 --> 00:29:55.084
has commissioned an encyclopedia of archeoastronomy,

575
00:29:55.084 --> 00:29:56.687
one of the commissions.

576
00:29:57.167 --> 00:29:58.919
I think it's going to be published

577
00:29:58.919 --> 00:30:01.760
by the American University Press in Cairo.

578
00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:08.095
They have contacted various archeoastronomers--

579
00:30:08.095 --> 00:30:10.569
there isn't that many in the world, by the way;

580
00:30:10.569 --> 00:30:12.813
it's a new science--

581
00:30:12.813 --> 00:30:17.762
to put entries specifically on Egypt.

582
00:30:17.762 --> 00:30:21.767
One of these experts

583
00:30:21.767 --> 00:30:24.163
is a professor of archeoastronomy.

584
00:30:24.163 --> 00:30:26.151
He founded the first chair of archeoastronomy

585
00:30:26.151 --> 00:30:31.046
in Italy, and he chose the star religion of ancient Egypt,

586
00:30:32.126 --> 00:30:35.967
and mostly it will be about my work.

587
00:30:35.967 --> 00:30:39.523
But he's finally taking a stance of saying,

588
00:30:39.523 --> 00:30:43.029
as far as he's concerned, the star shafts are proven,

589
00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:45.968
those shafts are proven to be star-aligned shafts.

590
00:30:45.968 --> 00:30:47.902
That's it, proven, stop discussion.

591
00:30:47.902 --> 00:30:49.701
<v Woman>The ventilation story is over.</v>

592
00:30:49.701 --> 00:30:51.745
<v ->Finito, we're tired of it.</v>

593
00:30:51.745 --> 00:30:53.807
It doesn't work, we're going to put it aside.

594
00:30:54.297 --> 00:30:57.550
It's like this door that has become a world event.

595
00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:00.139
Everybody's aware that there are doors

596
00:31:00.139 --> 00:31:03.656
at the end of these shafts in the Great Pyramid.

597
00:31:04.886 --> 00:31:07.159
The discovery of this is almost from 1993.

598
00:31:07.159 --> 00:31:09.156
I know personally the discoverer.

599
00:31:09.156 --> 00:31:10.984
<v Woman>15 years ago.</v>

600
00:31:10.984 --> 00:31:14.094
<v ->14 years ago, to be exact.</v>

601
00:31:14.094 --> 00:31:17.261
Rudolf Gantenbrink, who discovered these doors,

602
00:31:17.261 --> 00:31:20.751
was ready to open them within a week.

603
00:31:20.751 --> 00:31:23.699
We have the technology, there's no problem at all.

604
00:31:23.704 --> 00:31:25.915
And yet, 14 years down the line,

605
00:31:25.915 --> 00:31:28.173
and they're still talking about when and if

606
00:31:28.173 --> 00:31:29.706
they're gonna open them.

607
00:31:29.706 --> 00:31:31.960
This is ridiculous; we can't move.

608
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.386
We're caught in a sort of catatonic

609
00:31:35.386 --> 00:31:37.466
condition here.

610
00:31:38.372 --> 00:31:42.510
I'm taking the matter out of the Egyptological hands.

611
00:31:43.248 --> 00:31:45.164
We're dealing with astronomical monuments,

612
00:31:45.164 --> 00:31:47.393
we're dealing with astronomical texts,

613
00:31:47.393 --> 00:31:49.581
we're dealing with astronomical religion.

614
00:31:49.668 --> 00:31:51.381
We need astronomers.

615
00:31:51.398 --> 00:31:53.498
I'm telling the Egyptologists, enough.

616
00:31:53.499 --> 00:31:55.566
You've had your go, we're bringing in

617
00:31:55.566 --> 00:31:57.133
the big guns in astronomy.

618
00:31:57.133 --> 00:32:01.609
And I'm talking Professor Archie Roy at Glasgow University,

619
00:32:01.609 --> 00:32:05.185
finally these people are coming around

620
00:32:05.185 --> 00:32:07.884
who have moved from classical astronomy

621
00:32:07.884 --> 00:32:10.450
to archeoastronomy, and they realize

622
00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:12.959
that they're the people who have to do it.

623
00:32:12.959 --> 00:32:15.245
When you're dealing with an exact science

624
00:32:15.245 --> 00:32:19.358
like astronomy, an alignment is an alignment.

625
00:32:19.358 --> 00:32:22.234
If you tell an astronomer, there is a temple

626
00:32:22.234 --> 00:32:26.089
or a pyramid, or a road aligned

627
00:32:26.089 --> 00:32:29.149
28 degrees north or east

628
00:32:30.029 --> 00:32:32.188
to the Egyptologists, doesn't mean a thing.

629
00:32:32.507 --> 00:32:33.842
An astronomer immediately knows

630
00:32:33.842 --> 00:32:36.159
that you're talking about the summer solstice, that's it.

631
00:32:36.359 --> 00:32:37.778
<v Woman>The summer solstice, yes.</v>

632
00:32:37.778 --> 00:32:39.276
<v ->We're not going to talk 20 years</v>

633
00:32:39.276 --> 00:32:40.450
to arrive at this conclusion.

634
00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:42.319
<v Woman>So in short, what does this mean?</v>

635
00:32:42.319 --> 00:32:44.583
Say the doors are opened, and this is borne out,

636
00:32:44.583 --> 00:32:47.718
that these are star shafts.

637
00:32:47.718 --> 00:32:50.353
<v ->We got an amazing situation.</v>

638
00:32:50.353 --> 00:32:55.195
We got the most amazing monument in history,

639
00:32:55.195 --> 00:32:59.327
a universal monument, everybody knows the Great Pyramid,

640
00:32:59.327 --> 00:33:02.753
of which we know absolutely nothing.

641
00:33:02.753 --> 00:33:06.143
We're not sure who built it,

642
00:33:06.143 --> 00:33:07.780
we're not sure when it was built,

643
00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:10.088
we're not sure why it was built,

644
00:33:10.088 --> 00:33:11.774
we're not sure how it was built.

645
00:33:11.774 --> 00:33:15.849
It's an amazing monument that has mystified

646
00:33:15.849 --> 00:33:17.989
and intrigued generations upon generations.

647
00:33:17.989 --> 00:33:22.625
And suddenly we find that within it are those little doors,

648
00:33:22.625 --> 00:33:26.308
and it's the $64,000 question.

649
00:33:26.507 --> 00:33:27.690
Not only they're little doors,

650
00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:29.258
but they're put in a very intriguing place,

651
00:33:29.258 --> 00:33:32.944
a most difficult place within the structure.

652
00:33:32.996 --> 00:33:36.735
Must have been hell to build whatever is there.

653
00:33:36.735 --> 00:33:41.735
A chamber, a box, a room; we don't know, but

654
00:33:42.072 --> 00:33:44.764
we must know--
<v Woman>What's behind</v>

655
00:33:44.764 --> 00:33:46.137
those doors.

656
00:33:46.137 --> 00:33:48.240
What would you say in terms of archeoastronomy

657
00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.307
what would you expect to be behind those doors

658
00:33:50.307 --> 00:33:51.938
if they were opened now?

659
00:33:53.116 --> 00:33:55.572
<v ->From nothing to the sky's the limit.</v>

660
00:33:55.729 --> 00:33:56.873
(laughter)

661
00:33:56.994 --> 00:33:59.490
I would not wager to guess
(laughter)

662
00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:02.834
because it's just one of those things that

663
00:34:02.834 --> 00:34:07.834
we may have nothing, and we may have everything.

664
00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:09.359
<v Woman>And it may bear out</v>

665
00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:10.601
that we're part of something much larger,

666
00:34:10.601 --> 00:34:13.126
and we're at a time that is critically important.

667
00:34:13.372 --> 00:34:17.712
<v ->Funny enough, there's a kind of buzz going on</v>

668
00:34:17.712 --> 00:34:20.930
to do with this site, hence why I'm calling this

669
00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:25.620
"Gathering of Souls," which I'll tell you in a minute.

670
00:34:27.259 --> 00:34:28.826
A lot of people are getting together,

671
00:34:28.826 --> 00:34:32.768
a lot of people who feel that there's something happening.

672
00:34:33.366 --> 00:34:35.165
What exactly I don't know, but--

673
00:34:35.165 --> 00:34:37.406
and it's to do with this place.

674
00:34:37.406 --> 00:34:39.937
There's a kind of message there,

675
00:34:39.937 --> 00:34:42.380
and we haven't quite got it.

676
00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:46.612
So I'm creating a message, if you like,

677
00:34:46.612 --> 00:34:50.212
with the festival I'm doing, which may not be

678
00:34:50.212 --> 00:34:53.253
the exact message, but let's give it a go.

679
00:34:59.454 --> 00:35:04.160
Not just our culture, but throughout historical

680
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.825
context of our civiization, we--

681
00:35:08.195 --> 00:35:09.005
(sneeze)

682
00:35:09.005 --> 00:35:09.954
Excuse me.

683
00:35:09.954 --> 00:35:10.791
<v Woman>Bless you.</v>

684
00:35:10.791 --> 00:35:12.503
<v ->Catching one.</v>

685
00:35:13.753 --> 00:35:17.788
We're affected by what I call talismans.

686
00:35:19.396 --> 00:35:22.530
For example, we've been fighting over the last 2,000 years

687
00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:25.890
over a piece of rock on Mount Zion.

688
00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:31.800
Muslims react violently if anything is done

689
00:35:32.155 --> 00:35:35.402
against their icons like the Koran

690
00:35:35.402 --> 00:35:40.249
or the crescent moon or whatever.

691
00:35:41.129 --> 00:35:44.677
We respond to these powerful talismans.

692
00:35:45.205 --> 00:35:49.454
The Great Pyramid is the talisman of this planet.

693
00:35:50.371 --> 00:35:53.401
And if a message is being sent on its behalf,

694
00:35:53.401 --> 00:35:57.065
using it as a talisman, it will be heard worldwide.

695
00:35:57.906 --> 00:36:00.553
People will listen, and this is what I have in mind

696
00:36:00.553 --> 00:36:04.553
is maybe that's what was intended.

697
00:36:06.015 --> 00:36:08.603
It's the only thing that explains the scale, for example.

698
00:36:08.603 --> 00:36:10.448
I mean, it could have been a small pyramid.

699
00:36:10.448 --> 00:36:13.792
But no, they wanted something that you are awed by,

700
00:36:13.792 --> 00:36:17.889
that you really get a kick out of.

701
00:36:18.067 --> 00:36:20.684
<v Woman>So it may be time for us to use that again.</v>

702
00:36:21.131 --> 00:36:24.130
<v ->The same way we use various other icons</v>

703
00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:26.904
in our publicity and marketing world,

704
00:36:26.904 --> 00:36:30.579
this is it, but it has to be used properly,

705
00:36:30.579 --> 00:36:32.824
it has to be used very intentionally, people.

706
00:36:32.824 --> 00:36:35.941
I'm gathering as much as I can of these kind of people,

707
00:36:35.941 --> 00:36:39.290
like Graham Hancock, John West, and a variety of others

708
00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:41.233
to send that message.

709
00:36:41.715 --> 00:36:44.783
We desperately need a message.

710
00:36:45.325 --> 00:36:46.660
We desperately need a message that comes

711
00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.795
from a wise civilization telling us

712
00:36:49.795 --> 00:36:53.029
something important about ourselves.

713
00:36:57.206 --> 00:36:58.540
We've gotta stop what's happening.

714
00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:01.044
I mean, we really have to.

715
00:37:01.044 --> 00:37:04.068
We're causing a huge mess on this planet.

716
00:37:04.068 --> 00:37:05.913
<v Woman>Gone too far.</v>
<v ->We are</v>

717
00:37:05.913 --> 00:37:10.152
in a very, very precarious moment.

718
00:37:10.152 --> 00:37:13.458
We have a clash of civilization building up.

719
00:37:13.458 --> 00:37:17.412
Huge imbalance between east and west.

720
00:37:17.578 --> 00:37:20.958
And we have toys that can cause us a lot of problems.

721
00:37:20.958 --> 00:37:23.112
I'm speaking about nuclear power.

722
00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:26.539
We've got to get

723
00:37:26.539 --> 00:37:30.711
this thing cleared.

724
00:37:30.831 --> 00:37:31.895
We've got to get together and do it,

725
00:37:31.895 --> 00:37:34.466
and it's not our politicians who are doing it.

726
00:37:35.105 --> 00:37:39.432
Like Graham was saying, we are responsible.

727
00:37:39.432 --> 00:37:41.443
Some of us have to do it.

728
00:37:41.444 --> 00:37:43.383
And if it's just sending words,

729
00:37:43.383 --> 00:37:45.718
words have changed the whole world.

730
00:37:47.988 --> 00:37:51.215
In a book that I wrote called Secret Chamber, by the way,

731
00:37:51.215 --> 00:37:53.821
I show how words, just simple words,

732
00:37:53.821 --> 00:37:58.705
the use of words have altered the course of history

733
00:37:59.845 --> 00:38:03.193
and changed the consciousness of the world.

734
00:38:03.376 --> 00:38:04.571
I'm thinking of course of Christ.

735
00:38:04.571 --> 00:38:08.739
I'm thinking of course of Alexander the Great.

736
00:38:08.739 --> 00:38:10.005
I'm thinking of Julius Caesar.

737
00:38:10.005 --> 00:38:10.980
I'm thinking of Napoleon.

738
00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:15.854
I'm thinking of people who have said things with such power

739
00:38:15.854 --> 00:38:17.961
that they've changed the world.

740
00:38:17.961 --> 00:38:20.505
<v Woman>So we need a collective voice now.</v>

741
00:38:20.506 --> 00:38:22.608
A collective voice of wisdom.

742
00:38:22.608 --> 00:38:25.632
<v ->We need to get things in what I call critical mass.</v>

743
00:38:25.632 --> 00:38:27.426
People have to get together.

744
00:38:27.426 --> 00:38:29.202
They're spread all over the world,

745
00:38:29.202 --> 00:38:31.449
they're not getting together.

746
00:38:31.621 --> 00:38:32.871
Yes, there are certainly groups,

747
00:38:32.871 --> 00:38:35.332
but we need a message that brings them together,

748
00:38:35.332 --> 00:38:40.138
and we need a place, and I'm calling the place the Sphinx.

749
00:38:41.432 --> 00:38:42.848
<v Woman>Thank you.</v>

750
00:38:42.848 --> 00:38:44.154
<v ->Pleasure.</v>

751
00:38:45.092 --> 00:38:47.817
<v ->To join Robert on one of his Egyptian field trips</v>

752
00:38:47.817 --> 00:38:50.081
and tune into the secrets of the ancients,

Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

758
00:39:03.966 --> 00:39:07.356
