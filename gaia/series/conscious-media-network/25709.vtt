00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.310 align:middle line:10%
>> I believe that Dr. Judy Wood
is perhaps the most significant

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.400 align:middle line:10%
voice on this, the 10th
anniversary of 9/11.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.670 align:middle line:10%
Her book, "Where
Did the Towers Go?"

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.890 align:middle line:10%
is mind boggling in
its implications.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.640 align:middle line:10%
The hundreds of images
throughout the book

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.860 align:middle line:10%
are surreal, even shocking.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.310 align:middle line:10%
Yet, in the face of the evidence
that the WTC buildings were not

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.060 align:middle line:10%
brought down by either airplanes
or a controlled demolition,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.910 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Wood makes no
attempt to point fingers

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle line:10%
at who or why the
buildings came down.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.770 align:middle line:10%
In fact, this interview
reveals that it

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.440 align:middle line:10%
is a respect for the
technology that likely

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.690 align:middle line:10%
did the catastrophic
damage that propelled

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:44.980 align:middle line:10%
her to write this book.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.600 align:middle line:10%
A book that has
colossal implications.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.370 align:middle line:10%
Let's go to Dr. Wood.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.960 align:middle line:10%
Judy, thanks so
much for being here.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.540 align:middle line:10%
This book, "Where
Did the Towers Go?"

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.050 align:middle line:10%
seems to me to be the single
most comprehensive look at what

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.670 align:middle line:10%
happened on the day of 9/11.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.060 align:middle line:10%
And that's kind of
loaded, and we'll

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.920 align:middle line:10%
get into that in a little bit.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.380 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there are
so many surprises.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.630 align:middle line:10%
I thought I had read a
lot about this event,

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.847 align:middle line:10%
but page after page, I was
shocked by the information

00:01:13.847 --> 00:01:14.680 align:middle line:10%
you were presenting.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.940 align:middle line:10%
And a very timely--

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.220 align:middle line:10%
just a little timely thing
before we get in here

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.960 align:middle line:10%
was with having a week of
news on Hurricane Irene,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.480 align:middle line:10%
which was, what, a Category 1--

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.030 align:middle line:10%
>> It was by two miles an hour.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.080 align:middle line:10%
Two miles an hour.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.650 align:middle line:10%
Dropping down to
a tropical storm.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.480 align:middle line:10%
A week's worth of hysterical
coverage in the media.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.320 align:middle line:10%
However, one of the little known
things I'm just going to toss

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.050 align:middle line:10%
out there right off the top
was, there was a hurricane--

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.820 align:middle line:10%
a massive hurricane--

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.490 align:middle line:10%
much greater-- what
was it, a Category 3,

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.030 align:middle line:10%
I believe, sitting right off
the coast of New York City

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.410 align:middle line:10%
on the day of 9/11.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.140 align:middle line:10%
And I haven't
talked to one person

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.695 align:middle line:10%
that even knew that was there.

00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:54.070 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, you've been
getting a lot of reports on that

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.720 align:middle line:10%
as I understand.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.070 align:middle line:10%
There is a fellow
who e-mailed me.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.200 align:middle line:84%
He, as synchronicity would
have it, he was reading my book

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.660 align:middle line:84%
and had just gotten
to Chapter 18.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.240 align:middle line:84%
This is a college
professor in Vermont

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.700 align:middle line:84%
who had heard all of these
horrendous news reports

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.590 align:middle line:90%
about Hurricane Irene coming.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.150 align:middle line:84%
So he turns to the
start of Chapter 18

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and there was this big
Hurricane Erin picture.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.170 align:middle line:10%
And huh, and he
finished the book

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:10%
and then ordered five more.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was shocked
when I saw that.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.750 align:middle line:10%
But you know what
I was even shocked

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.590 align:middle line:10%
more by was what appeared to be
cleansed weather forecasts that

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.520 align:middle line:10%
were going on just prior to
the buildings going down.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And here, this massive hurricane
sitting right off the coast

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.210 align:middle line:90%
headed right into New York City.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying, well,
it's a lovely day here.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.350 align:middle line:90%
And they even had a little--

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.320 align:middle line:90%
as you show in the book--

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.903 align:middle line:84%
little red arrows
pointing where there

00:02:51.903 --> 00:02:54.700 align:middle line:84%
will be a thunderstorm a
little later on in the day

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.860 align:middle line:90%
or at a tornado kicking up.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.230 align:middle line:10%
And yet, they're
ignoring this huge thing

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.380 align:middle line:10%
that should have been dead
center of their coverage.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.500 align:middle line:10%
And what shocked me-- and I
know you're not a conspiracy

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.870 align:middle line:10%
theorist, and I'm not
asking you to go there--

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.930 align:middle line:10%
how in the world--
why in the world

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.540 align:middle line:10%
would that not be right
up front and center

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.010 align:middle line:10%
of the coverage that day?

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.770 align:middle line:10%
Not just of the weather, but
dominating all of the news?

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.000 align:middle line:10%
And that's just one of so many
anomalous events and stories

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.550 align:middle line:10%
that lead to that
kind of question.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.330 align:middle line:10%
Let's just launch into it.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.550 align:middle line:10%
We can start really going
in the order of your book

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.400 align:middle line:10%
because it's so well laid out.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.920 align:middle line:10%
Your evidence is really--

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle line:10%
it's pointing to something
different than the 9/11 truth

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.280 align:middle line:10%
movement and the architects and
various people that have stated

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.780 align:middle line:10%
that this was a
thermite-based explosion,

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.230 align:middle line:10%
the building had been wired
in advance, and so forth.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.080 align:middle line:10%
And what you're saying
in this is essentially

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.360 align:middle line:10%
it is very different than that.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.647 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about why.

00:03:57.647 --> 00:03:59.230 align:middle line:10%
Where would you like
to start with it?

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.110 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we can get right into
pancakes or whatever you like.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I like to
look at evidence.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.450 align:middle line:10%
Because 9/11 was a
psychological operation.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.600 align:middle line:10%
It was a physical destruction
and psychological destruction.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:10%
It was both.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.140 align:middle line:10%
And the psychological
destruction

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.440 align:middle line:10%
planted seeds out
there to divert people.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.970 align:middle line:84%
If they were not accepting
the official story that

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.820 align:middle line:84%
went out on the media, there was
a backup story being planted.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And it gets people caught
up in arguing about opinions

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.410 align:middle line:90%
and theories and speculations.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's just look at the evidence,
because evidence is unifying.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:10%
And what you've been very, very
careful to do here in the book

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.200 align:middle line:10%
and also in the
media is, you are not

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.750 align:middle line:10%
venturing to say who may have
perpetrated this event, why

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.900 align:middle line:10%
they perpetrated it, or even
how they perpetrated it,

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.900 align:middle line:10%
although you do put some very
strong evidence down here

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.910 align:middle line:10%
as to what happened.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.460 align:middle line:84%
You wanted to stick
with the facts only

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.650 align:middle line:84%
and allow other people
to begin putting

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.880 align:middle line:90%
their own dots together.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.380 align:middle line:90%
Is out my understanding?

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, also, you need to begin
with the evidence to show what

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.920 align:middle line:84%
the crime was you want
to charge somebody for.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.860 align:middle line:10%
If you're going to say,
they did it, what is "it?"

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:20.530 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.480 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And that recent Casey
Anthony trial that was hyped

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.610 align:middle line:84%
in the media, they were
determining all sorts

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.450 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.900 align:middle line:84%
But the next day, a jury
member said it so wonderfully.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.590 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, I don't
know how the child died.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.540 align:middle line:84%
How could I put somebody
on death row for it?

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.700 align:middle line:10%
>> You have to know what the
crime is before you charge

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.720 align:middle line:10%
somebody with it.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:10%
And that's the first step
in any investigation.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.890 align:middle line:10%
So start with the evidence.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, let's first just
give me a little list

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.915 align:middle line:10%
of your credentials because
you're a serious engineer

00:05:56.915 --> 00:05:59.255 align:middle line:10%
in many modalities
of engineering.

00:05:59.255 --> 00:06:00.630 align:middle line:10%
Can you just tell
us a little bit

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.760 align:middle line:10%
so we understand who you are.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I have a bachelor of
science in civil engineering,

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.900 align:middle line:10%
a master's degree in
engineering mechanics,

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.650 align:middle line:10%
which is like applied physics,
and a PhD in materials

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.910 align:middle line:10%
engineering science, with
expertise in image analysis,

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.570 align:middle line:10%
optical methods,
applied mechanics,

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.880 align:middle line:10%
and over 35 years of
experience in this area.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.630 align:middle line:10%
I just wanted to get that up
front so people understand

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.470 align:middle line:10%
this is not a theory.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.710 align:middle line:10%
You're a scientist
through and through,

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.990 align:middle line:10%
and this book is
absolutely amazing in what

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.247 align:middle line:10%
you've compiled.

00:06:34.247 --> 00:06:36.830 align:middle line:10%
I have to tell you, when it came
to the mathematical formulas,

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.992 align:middle line:10%
I kind of went to the next page
and just got the gist of it.

00:06:40.992 --> 00:06:42.950 align:middle line:10%
That's the only part I
didn't hang with you on,

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.330 align:middle line:10%
but I understood the concept
of what you were saying.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:46.130 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.020 align:middle line:10%
So out of the chute,
everyone knows

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.160 align:middle line:10%
what the official story is.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.660 align:middle line:10%
And I think anyone
listening to this

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.340 align:middle line:10%
has already dismissed
that long ago.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.807 align:middle line:10%
But would they probably have not
dismissed is that this was a--

00:06:57.807 --> 00:06:59.390 align:middle line:10%
most people at this
point are thinking

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.930 align:middle line:10%
that this was a controlled
demolition and there were

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.360 align:middle line:10%
explosives used and
many people have

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.040 align:middle line:10%
read or been exposed
to the notion

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.880 align:middle line:10%
that thermite may
have been involved.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.840 align:middle line:10%
And let's start it into
a bit of the science.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:10%
I know we have a lot
to do in an hour here.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.430 align:middle line:10%
But let's start into that.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.840 align:middle line:10%
>> A quick summary is that
the buildings didn't burn up,

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.640 align:middle line:10%
nor did they slam to the ground,
but they turned into dust

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.320 align:middle line:10%
in midair.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.040 align:middle line:10%
How do I know that?

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.330 align:middle line:10%
Because if they
collapsed to the ground,

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.090 align:middle line:10%
you would have a pile of
debris that would correspond

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.880 align:middle line:10%
two 110 story buildings.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.920 align:middle line:10%
That didn't happen.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.350 align:middle line:10%
Lower Manhattan would
have been flooded

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.600 align:middle line:10%
due to a broken bathtub.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.250 align:middle line:10%
The dike that holds
up the Hudson River.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.830 align:middle line:10%
Few people realize that the
towers were built in the Hudson

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:51.800 align:middle line:10%
River, and the bedrock is 70
feet below the water table.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.220 align:middle line:10%
So there's this dike called
the bathtub or slurry wall that

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.320 align:middle line:10%
holds out the Hudson River.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.160 align:middle line:10%
If you crash down two
500,000 ton buildings

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:10%
on to the bathtub, it would
have ruptured and flooded

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.430 align:middle line:10%
the subway tunnels,
the PATH train tunnels.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.720 align:middle line:10%
That didn't happen.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.940 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of fact,
when they took down

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.000 align:middle line:10%
the remains of Building
6, they used a cable

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.330 align:middle line:10%
to pull it down because they
were afraid to use explosives.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.310 align:middle line:10%
And this was a six
story building.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.800 align:middle line:10%
It was just this
little clump left.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.370 align:middle line:10%
And the other way I know
that buildings turned

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.600 align:middle line:10%
to dust, just the simple way,
is that if the buildings had

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.429 align:middle line:10%
collapsed to the ground,
they'd make a thud.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.330 align:middle line:10%
And the seismic signal
that was that was recorded

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:40.250 align:middle line:10%
did not correspond to the
size of the buildings.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:45.440 align:middle line:84%
The seismic signal corresponded
to a 16 story building or a 20

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.030 align:middle line:84%
story building, not
110 story buildings.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
talking about this,

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.310 align:middle line:90%
you call it "dustification."

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:56.650 align:middle line:10%
You're looking at--

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.510 align:middle line:10%
I mean, just the
real basics, you

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.850 align:middle line:10%
would expect at least
for there to at least be,

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.580 align:middle line:10%
as you say that, pancake
effect if there had actually

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.640 align:middle line:10%
been even a controlled
demolition of the building.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.660 align:middle line:90%
There was no pancake.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.020 align:middle line:90%
There were no pancakes.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.882 align:middle line:10%
You'd have a bumpety,
bumpety, bumpety, bump

00:09:12.882 --> 00:09:14.840 align:middle line:10%
and you should have a
stack of stuff left over.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.780 align:middle line:10%
Not only that, if you're
driving this jackhammer bumpety,

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.350 align:middle line:10%
bumpety, bumpety
bump onto bedrock,

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:22.020 align:middle line:10%
the ground should be shaking.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:22.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:23.195 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:09:23.195 --> 00:09:23.995 align:middle line:10%
>> And it wasn't.

00:09:23.995 --> 00:09:26.270 align:middle line:10%
The ground actually--
with that little signal--

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.430 align:middle line:10%
only shook for eight seconds.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.920 align:middle line:10%
It would take 9 and
1/2 seconds in a vacuum

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.510 align:middle line:10%
to drop a bowling
ball off the roof

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.810 align:middle line:10%
and have it hit the pavement.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:34.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.360 align:middle line:10%
At the same time, the building
itself came down in how many

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.810 align:middle line:10%
seconds?

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.810 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't say it came down.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it had
turned into dust.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.170 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.880 align:middle line:10%
>> So if you dustify--

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.620 align:middle line:10%
if you have a new
phenomenon, you

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.240 align:middle line:10%
need a new word to describe it.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:56.480 align:middle line:10%
>> It's unscientific to use
the description of a known

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.940 align:middle line:10%
phenomenon to describe
an unknown phenomenon.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.558 align:middle line:90%
So I say "dustification."

00:10:01.558 --> 00:10:03.350 align:middle line:10%
We've never seen a
building do this before,

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:04.790 align:middle line:10%
so it was a new thing.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:09.740 align:middle line:10%
So if the building dustifies
from the 20th story on up,

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.563 align:middle line:10%
and you're only dropping
the lower 20 stories,

00:10:14.563 --> 00:10:16.480 align:middle line:10%
which is about the size
of the rubble you see,

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.430 align:middle line:10%
which is about the
size the seismic signal

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:10%
you see, and so forth.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.680 align:middle line:10%
And surrounding buildings
didn't have any stab wounds,

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.280 align:middle line:10%
I call it.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.870 align:middle line:10%
A beam stabbing into a building.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Didn't have that above
like the 20th floor.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.780 align:middle line:10%
>> And this is not to
be confused even with

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.250 align:middle line:10%
pulverization.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:38.050 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:38.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Let's talk about that.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:43.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Pulverization is like
grinding something up.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:48.550 align:middle line:10%
You can hammer and hit a
rock against another rock,

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.740 align:middle line:10%
you get big chunks,
little chunks,

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.420 align:middle line:10%
in between sized chunks.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.430 align:middle line:10%
You get a random size.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.790 align:middle line:10%
You don't get nano
sized particles.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.332 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:10:59.332 --> 00:11:01.540 align:middle line:10%
Because a lot of people say,
well, it was pulverized.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.470 align:middle line:10%
No, it wasn't pulverized.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:03.940 align:middle line:10%
You're being very
specific when you

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:08.600 align:middle line:10%
say this building was dustified
or converted to dust rapidly.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.200 align:middle line:10%
Exactly.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.160 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a different process
than what we've seen before.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.530 align:middle line:90%
And it's not vaporization.

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.170 align:middle line:90%
Vaporization implies heat.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And the building
wasn't cooked.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.520 align:middle line:10%
>> And at the same time, you
have recordings of people who

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.990 align:middle line:10%
were standing on the window
sills and who were calling

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:34.750 align:middle line:10%
in on 911 and saying
they were so hot.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.500 align:middle line:84%
They had started taking
clothing off even.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.730 align:middle line:90%
What was going on there?

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:43.780 align:middle line:10%
Take us through to that point
of what you see in the building.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.330 align:middle line:10%


00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:10%
>> I used to swim a lot in the
mornings when I was at Virginia

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.510 align:middle line:10%
Tech, and a fraternity party had
choked her out the night before

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.570 align:middle line:10%
and cranked up the thermostat.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.670 align:middle line:10%
And when we got there,
it was like 93 degrees.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:00.370 align:middle line:10%
They said we could
swim at our own risk.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:01.240 align:middle line:10%
And I started swimming.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.860 align:middle line:10%
Oh, this is great because I
hate getting in cold water.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.450 align:middle line:10%
I got halfway out the
middle of the pool

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.783 align:middle line:10%
and I realized I was in trouble.

00:12:05.783 --> 00:12:06.830 align:middle line:10%
I was overheating.

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:09.040 align:middle line:10%
So I rolled over on my
back just to kind of quit

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.860 align:middle line:10%
making more heat and
somebody threw me a rope.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.730 align:middle line:10%
And I remember wondering, is
it that important to reach over

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:15.730 align:middle line:10%
there and get that rope?

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, your mind wasn't working.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.350 align:middle line:10%
And I remember
also there's a time

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.950 align:middle line:10%
limit how long you can stay
in the sauna, in the hot tub.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:32.740 align:middle line:10%
Now if you're really hot,
you just don't function.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:10%
And these recordings that we
heard like of the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.390 align:middle line:10%
I'm really hot, I'm really
hot, I'm really burning up.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:38.765 align:middle line:10%
I can't breathe,
I can't breathe.

00:12:38.765 --> 00:12:40.960 align:middle line:10%
You never heard her
choking the entire time.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.820 align:middle line:10%
At first I thought
it was a fake call,

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:48.340 align:middle line:10%
but then I realized, no, there's
something else going on here.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.180 align:middle line:10%
For somebody to-- the
conversation in the Air Force

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:56.410 align:middle line:10%
is like five minutes and someone
cannot survive in that kind

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:58.930 align:middle line:10%
of heat that she was
describing for five minutes.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:01.310 align:middle line:10%
So apparently she
was sensing heat.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:02.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:03.930 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about that.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.410 align:middle line:10%
And what happened with--

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.460 align:middle line:10%
another thing I was--

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.440 align:middle line:10%
besides the fact that these
buildings turn to dust,

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.530 align:middle line:10%
so we can go into
all the science,

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.110 align:middle line:10%
but really I would
encourage people

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:15.660 align:middle line:10%
to get a copy of the book.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.890 align:middle line:10%
It explains all
the science right

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:19.960 align:middle line:10%
through from the
very beginning, when

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.220 align:middle line:10%
the buildings were standing.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.077 align:middle line:10%
You take people through
this very nicely.

00:13:23.077 --> 00:13:24.910 align:middle line:10%
We don't have to get
into all of the science

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.950 align:middle line:10%
and equations here on that.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:30.370 align:middle line:10%
Let's just say, these
buildings turned to dust.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:10%
>> I think you're alluding to--

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.580 align:middle line:10%
>> The heat.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.330 align:middle line:10%
>> The jumpers.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:34.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.430 align:middle line:10%
The jumpers and the
heat and the heat

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:39.000 align:middle line:10%
that you said this
building did not burn.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Yet, they keep it kept
saying, I'm so hot.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And then we have these people
hanging from the outside

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.030 align:middle line:90%
of the 105th floor.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:54.940 align:middle line:10%
That's five floors from the
top taking off their clothes.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.190 align:middle line:10%
Or with their
clothes already off.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:58.720 align:middle line:10%
Clothes protect
you from high heat.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.135 align:middle line:10%
They protect you from fire.

00:14:02.135 --> 00:14:04.400 align:middle line:10%
And also, if you need to
take your clothes off,

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.610 align:middle line:10%
why hang from the 105th
floor by hand and a foot

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:10%
to take your clothes off.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:09.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:12.920 align:middle line:10%
So what was going on there?

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.140 align:middle line:10%
Why were they so hot if
you're saying there was

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.780 align:middle line:10%
no fire-- it wasn't about fire?

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:19.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I wasn't
there, so I don't know.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.060 align:middle line:10%
But I can say it's consistent
with something like an energy

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.160 align:middle line:10%
field.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.460 align:middle line:10%
You think of microwaves
used to control crowds.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.810 align:middle line:10%
They make the
crowds run and make

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:32.390 align:middle line:10%
crowds want to just
get away from it

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.650 align:middle line:10%
because it's just very painful.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:39.020 align:middle line:10%
And so like what [INAUDIBLE]
was describing was intense pain.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:39.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:44.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Not thermal heat, but the
sensation to her nerve endings.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Are you saying then--

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.560 align:middle line:10%
because, again, going
back to the building

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.080 align:middle line:10%
without going into all the
science of it right here,

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.830 align:middle line:10%
these buildings pulverized--

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:54.860 align:middle line:10%
they didn't pulverize,
they dustified.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:55.930 align:middle line:10%
They dustified.

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:58.207 align:middle line:10%
These people are
saying, "I'm so hot."

00:14:58.207 --> 00:14:59.540 align:middle line:10%
They're standing out on a ledge.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.270 align:middle line:10%
And what really struck me about
the people portion of this--

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.210 align:middle line:10%
I really couldn't get
it off my mind is that--

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:08.450 align:middle line:10%
and it struck me about
this at the time.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.880 align:middle line:10%
First of all, I was under the
impression for some reason

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.430 align:middle line:10%
that maybe a few dozen
people had jumped.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:19.940 align:middle line:10%
Yet, you're saying, a
massive number of people

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:23.870 align:middle line:10%
jumped, fell, or were
propelled from these ledges.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was the emergency help
on the ground was saying,

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.930 align:middle line:90%
it was raining people.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:33.170 align:middle line:10%
People were falling out of
the air at the rate of one

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.590 align:middle line:10%
every 30 or 40 seconds.

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:38.225 align:middle line:10%
But that's not human
nature to jump.

00:15:38.225 --> 00:15:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Those poor firefighters,
they're trained to save lives.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:43.970 align:middle line:90%
And they felt so helpless.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.470 align:middle line:84%
I think there was
even one that they

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.370 align:middle line:84%
had to watch because he wanted
to go out and catch people.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Feeling helpless has got to
be the worst human experience.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, and just the oddness
of that many people supposedly

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:58.430 align:middle line:10%
jumping.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:02.188 align:middle line:10%
Well, first of all, are you
saying they were jumping--

00:16:02.188 --> 00:16:04.730 align:middle line:10%
because you have some pictures
in there where they didn't all

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:05.930 align:middle line:10%
look like they were jumping.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:08.760 align:middle line:10%
Some of them looked as though
they were caught off guard.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:10%
I'm just putting
this data out there.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.660 align:middle line:10%
It's cumulative data, and
it just keeps you wondering,

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.430 align:middle line:10%
what is going on here.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:middle line:10%
We don't we have to come to a
conclusion with each chapter,

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.700 align:middle line:10%
but we can sum things up
and say, this is not normal.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.090 align:middle line:10%
A fire doesn't cause
people to behave this way.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:30.260 align:middle line:10%
Bombs in the building don't
cause people behave this way.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.570 align:middle line:10%
What they were doing--

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.510 align:middle line:10%
the way they were
behaving or perhaps

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:38.330 align:middle line:10%
the way they were feeling
inside their own skin

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.960 align:middle line:10%
was not anything that is we
would recognize as normal.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.520 align:middle line:10%
Something abnormal
was happening.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.840 align:middle line:10%
And taking it from there, the
emergency workers, firemen,

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.630 align:middle line:10%
and so forth were saying,
when the people landed

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.040 align:middle line:10%
on the ground-- and
this is very bothersome.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.060 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is just really
not a pleasant thought or scene

00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:00.590 align:middle line:10%
in our minds, but the people
didn't just fall and crumble,

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.950 align:middle line:10%
crunch like what normally would
happen at a freefall speed.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:05.690 align:middle line:10%
They were exploding.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:08.480 align:middle line:10%
There were body
parts everywhere.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.349 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:12.109 align:middle line:10%
And that is a very
delicate thing.

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:17.210 align:middle line:10%
I myself endured a
near fatal injury

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:20.119 align:middle line:10%
from being hit by
a vehicle traveling

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:22.880 align:middle line:10%
in excess of 80 miles per hour.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.140 align:middle line:10%
So this is the first time
I think I've said this,

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.190 align:middle line:10%
but I had a real connection with
those jumpers because of that.

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:35.690 align:middle line:90%


00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:39.020 align:middle line:10%
Their freefall speed,
their terminal velocity

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:43.070 align:middle line:10%
can't be much more than
that in street clothes.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:46.600 align:middle line:10%
And you'd know that when you
hit a deer with a vehicle,

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.560 align:middle line:10%
it's busted up.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.080 align:middle line:10%
And there's very little
chance of survival,

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.310 align:middle line:10%
but there is a chance
and it's busted up.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:18:00.230 align:middle line:10%
You don't have a fingernail
over here, a tooth over there,

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:02.180 align:middle line:10%
a rib over here.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.830 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't take things
apart like that.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:06.590 align:middle line:10%
No, it doesn't.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:08.270 align:middle line:10%
And we were talking about it--

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:09.890 align:middle line:10%
I was talking to
Scott about this,

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:14.540 align:middle line:10%
and what we both came
to, of course, is

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.000 align:middle line:10%
it sounded more like a human--

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.970 align:middle line:10%
or when you hear these hard
stories of little children

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:21.890 align:middle line:10%
experimenting and
putting a little animal

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.860 align:middle line:10%
inside a microwave or
something awful like that,

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.640 align:middle line:10%
this sounded really much more
along that line than anything

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.550 align:middle line:10%
that would be a normal
fall and the injuries

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:33.780 align:middle line:10%
or death from a normal fall.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:34.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:35.300 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.310 align:middle line:10%
It was definitely something
different going on there.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.573 align:middle line:10%
It was almost as though
they were being microwaved

00:18:39.573 --> 00:18:41.180 align:middle line:10%
and splattering and blowing--

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:43.520 align:middle line:10%
literally their bodies
pieces blowing apart.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.500 align:middle line:10%
And how many people
are we talking

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.365 align:middle line:10%
about that actually fell,
jumped, or were propelled out

00:18:49.365 --> 00:18:50.165 align:middle line:10%
of the building?

00:18:50.165 --> 00:18:52.870 align:middle line:10%


00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:57.510 align:middle line:10%
>> It estimated from the
firemens' testimonies about

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:04.240 align:middle line:10%
1,200 out of the North Tower
and then add to that the 343

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:12.200 align:middle line:10%
firefighters, you get 1,543.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.730 align:middle line:10%
And that's about as
much DNA samples--

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:19.140 align:middle line:10%
different people approximately--
that were identified.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.740 align:middle line:10%
So that raises another question.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.830 align:middle line:10%
>> And that question is?

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Those on the first or
second or third floor--

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:30.160 align:middle line:10%
firefighters-- or those who
jumped from the building

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.510 align:middle line:10%
or left the building
out the windows

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:36.568 align:middle line:10%
seemed to be the only
samples of DNA that remained.

00:19:36.568 --> 00:19:38.860 align:middle line:10%
>> And I guess you're not
going to speculate as to what

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.115 align:middle line:10%
happened to the rest.

00:19:42.115 --> 00:19:45.160 align:middle line:10%
>> It makes you wonder
about dustification.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes it does.

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.980 align:middle line:10%
And as people are listening
to this right now,

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.770 align:middle line:10%
we've listened to
enough other interviews,

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.570 align:middle line:10%
especially from
those who believe

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:58.210 align:middle line:10%
that this was the result of
a demolition, a controlled

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:01.270 align:middle line:10%
demolition, and one of
the things that comes up

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:04.960 align:middle line:10%
repeatedly is, well, if this
wasn't a controlled demolition,

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.870 align:middle line:10%
then why were all of these
firefighters reporting

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:11.470 align:middle line:10%
hearing a series of explosions,
especially down in the lower

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:13.730 align:middle line:10%
levels?

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, if you're
dustifying a building,

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.250 align:middle line:10%
that means the material
is coming apart.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.850 align:middle line:10%
It's losing its
strength and integrity.

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:24.500 align:middle line:10%
The towers had water tanks
every so many floors.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.000 align:middle line:10%
You can't pump water all the
way directly to the top anyway,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.830 align:middle line:10%
so they pump it to different
holding tanks every so

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.330 align:middle line:10%
many floors.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:32.920 align:middle line:10%
Now imagine what
will happen when

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:38.930 align:middle line:10%
those water tanks start to
dissolve, lose their integrity.

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:40.730 align:middle line:10%
They're going to rupture.

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:45.260 align:middle line:10%
Or an air pressure tank, when
the wall thickness gets so thin

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.180 align:middle line:10%
or loses certain
amount of strength,

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.790 align:middle line:10%
it's going to explode.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:54.230 align:middle line:10%
And actually, there were
firefighters at ground level--

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:57.950 align:middle line:10%
quite a few of
them-- who witnessed

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:59.720 align:middle line:10%
Scott tanks exploding.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.160 align:middle line:10%
>> What is a Scott tank?

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.220 align:middle line:10%
>> They are the air tanks that
the firefighters wear so they

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.740 align:middle line:10%
can breathe good air
while they're in the smoky

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:07.690 align:middle line:10%
environment.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, and they were
exploding as well.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Sitting on the fire
trucks, they were exploding.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:14.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:17.600 align:middle line:10%
Well, again, we're
talking about people

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.200 align:middle line:10%
who almost appear to have
exploded, a building that

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:26.990 align:middle line:10%
has turned to dust, 1,200 people
were driven to either fell

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:29.240 align:middle line:10%
or jump to their death,
which I just I still

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.120 align:middle line:10%
have a hard time getting
my mind around that one.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.040 align:middle line:10%
It's appalling.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.370 align:middle line:10%
I had had no idea it was
that number of people.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:40.070 align:middle line:10%
And now you're talking
about these exploding Scott

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.642 align:middle line:10%
tanks that were sitting
in their trucks.

00:21:42.642 --> 00:21:44.600 align:middle line:10%
Let's take that a little
bit further when we're

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.350 align:middle line:10%
talking about these explosions.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:53.090 align:middle line:10%
There were cars and trucks,
including fire trucks,

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:57.170 align:middle line:10%
that were toasted
and literally taken

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.210 align:middle line:10%
into the air in some cases.

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Now talk about that,
if you would, please.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I refer to them as toasted
cars because they're toast.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:07.370 align:middle line:90%
They're history.

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I can't decide
what happened to them.

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:15.070 align:middle line:10%
Instead of trying to force
them into burned or whatnot,

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:17.180 align:middle line:10%
I just say they're toast.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:21.440 align:middle line:90%
And it seemed to be that cars--

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.960 align:middle line:84%
I started noticing
this pattern--

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.280 align:middle line:84%
there's flipped
cars, but they didn't

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:29.330 align:middle line:84%
seem to be as toasted
as the upright cars.

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And this one particular
picture is a toasted car

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:34.020 align:middle line:84%
and in front of it there's
an upside down car.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.450 align:middle line:84%
It was parked in
the right place.

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:36.890 align:middle line:90%
It's just wheels in the air.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:38.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:38.330 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.290 align:middle line:10%
>> And you wouldn't
think it parked that way.

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:41.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, no.

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:43.710 align:middle line:10%
You wouldn't think it
would park that way.

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:48.540 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a particular quote by
Rene Davila that I liked is you

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:49.920 align:middle line:10%
put big question.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:56.330 align:middle line:10%
He's by supervisors as well,
was your vehicle destroyed.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:57.350 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, it was destroyed.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:58.340 align:middle line:10%
Was it on fire?

00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.140 align:middle line:10%
What?

00:22:59.140 --> 00:22:59.940 align:middle line:10%
Was it on fire?

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:00.740 align:middle line:10%
Fire?

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:01.980 align:middle line:10%
We saw the sucker blow up.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:02.990 align:middle line:10%
We heard a boom.

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:05.600 align:middle line:10%
And not only that,
some of the cars

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.180 align:middle line:10%
that went boom were
seven blocks away.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Now this gets pretty
controversial.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.720 align:middle line:10%
I mean, everything
here is controversial.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.850 align:middle line:10%
>> What do you mean
"controversial?"

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:20.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I mean, it seems
like this would be sort

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.520 align:middle line:10%
of a non-sequitur
scientifically.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.280 align:middle line:10%
Why would cars blow
up or be toast--

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.470 align:middle line:10%
not blow up but be incinerated--

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:30.860 align:middle line:10%
seven blocks away
during this event?

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.020 align:middle line:10%
>> And without burning paper.

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Without burning paper.

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:35.300 align:middle line:10%
How's that?

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.230 align:middle line:10%
How is that possible?

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:39.410 align:middle line:10%
>> That's why I use
"toast" instead of burned

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:41.710 align:middle line:10%
because that's weird.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:43.100 align:middle line:10%
Or I call it weird fires.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.260 align:middle line:10%
I have to have a
different term for it.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:49.490 align:middle line:10%
There's was a firefighter
who was over by FDR Drive

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:52.640 align:middle line:10%
and saw this car go into
spontaneous combustion.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.860 align:middle line:10%
And thinking like, it's got
to be a normal situation.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.275 align:middle line:10%
He's trying to fit what's
happened into that.

00:23:58.275 --> 00:24:00.650 align:middle line:10%
So, well, it must be a fireball
that roll down the street

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:01.650 align:middle line:10%
and hit the car.

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:04.670 align:middle line:10%
He didn't see the fireball,
but how else can you

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:07.340 align:middle line:10%
explain a car going into
spontaneous combustion?

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, yeah.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.040 align:middle line:10%
Exactly.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.320 align:middle line:10%
And why seven blocks
from the scene?

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.070 align:middle line:10%
That makes no sense whatsoever.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:18.140 align:middle line:10%
And yet, this all happened in
roughly the same time frame.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.840 align:middle line:10%
And at the same time, the
people that were there,

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.450 align:middle line:10%
as this was occurring--
speaking of combustion--

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:26.330 align:middle line:10%
a lot of the witnesses
there were saying,

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:29.050 align:middle line:10%
there was this odd sensation.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:31.370 align:middle line:10%
They weren't, as you
say, there wasn't

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:34.940 align:middle line:10%
the kind of seismic activity
that you would have expected.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.720 align:middle line:10%
There wasn't the crunching and
coming down of the building

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.280 align:middle line:10%
sound you would have expected.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.140 align:middle line:10%
But a lot of them had
the sense that they

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.380 align:middle line:10%
had been swept into
the center of a tornado

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:48.670 align:middle line:10%
or some kind of weather event.

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:53.150 align:middle line:10%
>> And there was one EMT who
thought maybe she must have

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:56.840 align:middle line:10%
died because how else was
she floating down the stairs

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.390 align:middle line:10%
but having God pick her up
and carry her down the stairs.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:00.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:01.310 align:middle line:10%
She's floating.

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:02.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:10.310 align:middle line:10%
And there's this one particular
eyewitness was talking about--

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:13.130 align:middle line:10%
he says, I don't remember the
sound of the building hitting

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:13.960 align:middle line:10%
the ground.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:18.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Someone told me that it was
measured on the Richter scale.

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:21.080 align:middle line:10%
I don't know how true that
is, but if the builder was

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.170 align:middle line:10%
hitting the ground hard, how do
I not remember the sound of it?

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:24.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:25.820 align:middle line:10%
I think I have him written down.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.510 align:middle line:10%
Michael Ober I
think was his name.

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:28.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:29.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah he was an EMT.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.250 align:middle line:10%
And again, this feeling.

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:34.880 align:middle line:10%
People were picked up and
they were tossed about

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.320 align:middle line:10%
and they would land 30, 40 feet
from where they had started.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.410 align:middle line:10%
Just picked up and they
landed somewhere else.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:42.780 align:middle line:10%
Cars.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.280 align:middle line:10%
There's a picture you have on
one of the pages of a car that

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.730 align:middle line:10%
had simply been picked
up and it looked

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:52.810 align:middle line:10%
as though it had been placed on
top of a little wooden fence.

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:54.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a very odd picture.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>> That's Hurricane Wilma.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's Hurricane Wilma.

00:25:57.905 --> 00:26:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I was drawing the comparison
with the same type of energy

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.870 align:middle line:90%
fields.

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:02.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:06.250 align:middle line:10%
That same thing where it's
just picked up and set down.

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.860 align:middle line:10%
Which, again, when
you're looking

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.500 align:middle line:10%
at that, if you want to talk
about that for just a second,

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.290 align:middle line:10%
why were you drawing the
comparison between Hurricane

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:16.720 align:middle line:10%
Wilma and the energy
signature of what

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.010 align:middle line:10%
was happening there that day?

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:19.360 align:middle line:10%
What's going on?

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, we started out
talking about hurricanes,

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:28.070 align:middle line:10%
and when I got to looking at the
dust and how the dust went up--

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:30.790 align:middle line:10%
and that was another comment
that Michael Ober had made

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:34.210 align:middle line:10%
is that he thought he
was inside somewhere.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:36.230 align:middle line:10%
Someone said no, you're outside.

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:37.760 align:middle line:10%
It's just dark out.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.330 align:middle line:10%
100% of the sunlight
was blacked out

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:47.200 align:middle line:10%
by this dust that went up for
about half hour afterwards.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.290 align:middle line:10%
It was up and blocking
out the sunlight.

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:53.790 align:middle line:10%
And so I decided to look to see
where it went when it went up.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:56.500 align:middle line:10%
And I looked at some
weather satellite pictures,

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.440 align:middle line:10%
thinking I could get a better
look at this dust going up.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.460 align:middle line:10%
And what's this?

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.180 align:middle line:10%
This hurricane.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.350 align:middle line:10%
It was the first time
I saw the hurricane.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:08.887 align:middle line:10%
And like how weird that we
weren't told about this.

00:27:08.887 --> 00:27:10.720 align:middle line:10%
I don't remember anything
about a hurricane.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.250 align:middle line:10%
Hmm.

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:13.738 align:middle line:10%
And it was a
Category 3 and it was

00:27:13.738 --> 00:27:15.905 align:middle line:10%
headed right to New York
City for four days straight

00:27:15.905 --> 00:27:16.820 align:middle line:10%
in a straight line.

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:17.620 align:middle line:10%
Hmm.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:19.110 align:middle line:10%
I wonder what hurricanes can do.

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.920 align:middle line:10%
So I start looking into that.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.110 align:middle line:10%
And they're like a
giant Tesla coil,

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:27.970 align:middle line:10%
and they produce a
static field around them

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:32.440 align:middle line:10%
and that interferes with
other types of signals.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:37.420 align:middle line:10%
And people who have arthritis,
or other people often

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:40.210 align:middle line:10%
talk about feeling
the weather coming.

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:43.420 align:middle line:10%
They can feel that field
effect ahead of the storm.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:46.570 align:middle line:10%
The same with the reason why
birds leave town or spiders

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:47.440 align:middle line:10%
pack up their webs.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.300 align:middle line:10%
They sense the storm come
because they feel that field

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.270 align:middle line:10%
effect.

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:57.130 align:middle line:10%
And also, in hurricanes, you
have cars sitting on fences,

00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:01.210 align:middle line:10%
and hurricanes are
a big torsion field.

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:05.170 align:middle line:10%
And a smaller, quicker
acting one is like a tornado.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:07.240 align:middle line:10%
So let's look at those too.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:11.740 align:middle line:10%
We remember seeing tornadoes
supposedly lifting up houses,

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:14.260 align:middle line:10%
putting them on
someplace or putting

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:17.290 align:middle line:10%
a car on a telephone pole.

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:19.090 align:middle line:10%
But the car isn't damaged.

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:22.210 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't like it
got tumbled around.

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:26.080 align:middle line:10%
And there's a lot of
evidence-- like the spring,

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.620 align:middle line:10%
that big Joplin tornado, there
is this video of these people

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:32.920 align:middle line:10%
locked in a cooler-- or ran to
the cooler in the convenience

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.230 align:middle line:10%
store for safety.

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:38.110 align:middle line:10%
And you hear everybody
screaming when

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:40.397 align:middle line:10%
the tornado was
tearing the place up,

00:28:40.397 --> 00:28:41.980 align:middle line:10%
but you didn't hear
it whoosh through.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:45.070 align:middle line:10%
So it didn't tear the
walls off of the cooler.

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:47.650 align:middle line:10%
But after it was done
with, everyone said,

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:49.600 align:middle line:10%
well, is that you under me?

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.580 align:middle line:10%
Is that your leg on top of me?

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:54.370 align:middle line:10%
So obviously the people
have been jostled around.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:57.280 align:middle line:10%
And you also saw the
camera flying around.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:01.030 align:middle line:10%
So there wasn't a moving wind
tunnel through that cooler

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:04.780 align:middle line:10%
they're in, but they were
levitated and tumbled around.

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:09.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Now this has to be the
result of some kind of, what,

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:12.220 align:middle line:10%
interference with
electromagnetic fields

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:13.240 align:middle line:10%
or a charge?

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.730 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I'm not a
scientist, but this

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:18.260 align:middle line:10%
is dealing with
electromagnetism, isn't it?

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:19.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:23.255 align:middle line:10%
It turns out, electricity,
magnetism, and gravity

00:29:23.255 --> 00:29:24.055 align:middle line:10%
all interact.

00:29:24.055 --> 00:29:26.790 align:middle line:10%


00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:32.480 align:middle line:10%
So it's possible to effect
gravity with magnetism.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:36.110 align:middle line:10%
And I think we all have the
experienced as youngsters

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:38.750 align:middle line:10%
getting a nail and wrapping
a wire coil around it

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:40.610 align:middle line:10%
and stick it in a
nine volt battery.

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:42.900 align:middle line:10%
It turns the magnet into--

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.050 align:middle line:10%
it turns the electricity
into a magnet.

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:47.690 align:middle line:90%
The nail becomes a magnet.

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Also, we learned
that if you move

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:54.450 align:middle line:84%
a conductor through a magnetic
field, you get electricity.

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:56.320 align:middle line:10%
Which is how Nikola Tesla--

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.340 align:middle line:10%
he discovered
alternating current

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:04.910 align:middle line:10%
and applied it to harnessing the
energy from the Niagara Falls

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:06.740 align:middle line:10%
power plant.

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.710 align:middle line:10%
So we can turn electricity
into magnetism.

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:11.620 align:middle line:10%
We can turn magnetism
into electricity.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:15.950 align:middle line:10%
We can also affect
gravity with magnetism.

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:19.130 align:middle line:10%
>> So just from what we're
talking about so far,

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:23.630 align:middle line:10%
there had to be some kind
of electromagnetics in play.

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:25.430 align:middle line:10%
And you were talking
about tornadoes

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:28.610 align:middle line:10%
and how they have this effect,
where they can pick things up

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:32.810 align:middle line:10%
without harming them through
this gravitational effect

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:35.130 align:middle line:10%
and land them or set
them down somewhere,

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:37.430 align:middle line:10%
but you don't have
dustification with tornadoes.

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:39.780 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there's more
than that at play here.

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:40.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:41.480 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:45.530 align:middle line:10%
You sometimes do or destruction.

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:48.530 align:middle line:10%
And that's just something
that's randomly oriented.

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:51.920 align:middle line:10%
And there are aspects
of the WTC complex

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.775 align:middle line:10%
that reminded me of tornadoes.

00:30:53.775 --> 00:30:55.130 align:middle line:10%
>> How so?

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:59.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Building 4, the main body
of Building 4 disappeared.

00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.870 align:middle line:10%
Turned into dust.

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:00.830 align:middle line:10%
Went away.

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:02.660 align:middle line:10%
And just left the
north wing standing

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.420 align:middle line:10%
or most of the north wing
standing, as though it was

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:08.300 align:middle line:10%
cut off with an X-Acto knife.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.870 align:middle line:10%
And one story below
ground, in that area,

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:15.050 align:middle line:10%
you see some people
walking through the mall.

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:18.020 align:middle line:10%
And then another story below
that, in the parking garage

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:22.560 align:middle line:10%
area, it looks
totally unaffected.

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.590 align:middle line:10%
Totally unaffected.

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:27.530 align:middle line:10%
>> As though it happened
from the ground up.

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:30.060 align:middle line:10%
A few little punch through
the ground here and there,

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:33.520 align:middle line:10%
but where did the main
body of Building 4 go?

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:37.630 align:middle line:10%
And it reminded me so much of
an experience I had as a child

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:39.370 align:middle line:10%
going through
Topeka, Kansas right

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:42.190 align:middle line:10%
after that horrendous
tornado that went through.

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:45.460 align:middle line:10%
You could look into
this apartment building

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.940 align:middle line:10%
that had been sliced in two.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.850 align:middle line:10%
There was a made bed in
there, with magazines

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:52.640 align:middle line:10%
still on the bed,
books on the dresser,

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.000 align:middle line:10%
and clothes hanging the
closet that weren't messed up.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:55.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.390 align:middle line:10%
And your book is
riddled with these kinds

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:01.750 align:middle line:10%
of surreal
photographs, and there

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:04.930 align:middle line:10%
are photographs of cars in
which the back half of the car

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:06.260 align:middle line:10%
looks fine--

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.170 align:middle line:10%
a police car for example.

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:10.330 align:middle line:10%
Half of the lights
are undamaged.

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:13.370 align:middle line:10%
The rest of the car
is completely toasted.

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:14.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:17.130 align:middle line:10%
Even to the point of
eating out the metal.

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:18.630 align:middle line:10%
They don't drive
all junkers around.

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:19.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:20.170 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:20.760 align:middle line:10%
The metal.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:20.950 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:22.060 align:middle line:10%
The metal is eaten out.

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:25.867 align:middle line:10%
And yet, the other half of the
car is intact-- totally intact.

00:32:25.867 --> 00:32:27.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Like it just came
off the showroom floor.

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:28.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly.

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.100 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it doesn't
even have scratches

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:31.630 align:middle line:10%
on the paint it looks like.

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:35.650 align:middle line:10%
>> And plastic police lights
on the top on one side look

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:38.330 align:middle line:10%
untouched and they would
melt pretty easily.

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:39.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:44.140 align:middle line:10%
And again, I mean, what can
cause something like that?

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:47.330 align:middle line:10%
I'm not suggesting that you'd
tell us what did happen,

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:50.560 align:middle line:10%
but I'm saying, what can
cause that kind of thing?

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.435 align:middle line:10%
>> When I see an abrupt change--

00:32:52.435 --> 00:32:55.120 align:middle line:10%


00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.080 align:middle line:10%
well, especially, between the
drivers and the front set door

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.240 align:middle line:10%
and the backseat door, I start
thinking about a rubber gasket

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.660 align:middle line:10%
between the two
that maybe it has

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:07.230 align:middle line:10%
some electrical--
or something that's

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:10.742 align:middle line:10%
sealed from the phenomenon
continuing further.

00:33:10.742 --> 00:33:12.200 align:middle line:10%
But the other side
of it, where has

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.980 align:middle line:10%
that circular spot
it's unaffected,

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.770 align:middle line:10%
that was aha moment for me.

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:19.870 align:middle line:10%
With a background
in interferometry

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:23.230 align:middle line:10%
I know that you can have
one beam or another,

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:26.170 align:middle line:10%
but where they interfere,
you get a different effect.

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:28.420 align:middle line:10%
>> So explain that to us a
little more regarding these

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:29.650 align:middle line:10%
cars.

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:32.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it's kind of
like a contact print with

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.080 align:middle line:10%
a photographic film.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.670 align:middle line:10%
You see an abrupt area--

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:38.320 align:middle line:10%
not shades of gray.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:42.460 align:middle line:10%
So there's something
that caused the toasting,

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:46.270 align:middle line:10%
and then one nanometer over,
it was in pristine condition.

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:47.278 align:middle line:10%
Fires don't do that.

00:33:47.278 --> 00:33:49.945 align:middle line:10%
>> So are you saying there was a
type of interference that would

00:33:49.945 --> 00:33:52.000 align:middle line:10%
occur to change that?

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.440 align:middle line:10%
>> That would
easily explain that.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.440 align:middle line:10%
Some type of interference,
because otherwise,

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.100 align:middle line:10%
you would have a
tapering off effect.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:58.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:33:58.900 --> 00:33:59.160 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:33:59.960 align:middle line:10%
That makes sense.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.970 align:middle line:10%
>> You see cars that
are burned from--

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:05.470 align:middle line:10%
and I'm not going to say burned
from a car fire that we know is

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:06.340 align:middle line:10%
a car fire.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:07.780 align:middle line:10%
You'll see at the
edge of where it

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:13.570 align:middle line:10%
stops burning, toasted area
and charred and less and less,

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:15.580 align:middle line:10%
and then it's pristine.

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:17.120 align:middle line:10%
There's a transition zone.

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:17.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:21.800 align:middle line:10%
>> But to have something abrupt,
it's like photographic masking

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.280 align:middle line:10%
in a way.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.590 align:middle line:10%
Again, I mean, there's
a surreal quality

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:29.860 align:middle line:10%
to that photograph, but also
many, many other photographs.

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:34.840 align:middle line:10%
Another one that was, to me, I
just kept staring at it was--

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:38.409 align:middle line:10%
I think it's Figure
104 in your book

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:44.835 align:middle line:10%
where you have these steel
core columns, which, I guess--

00:34:44.835 --> 00:34:46.210 align:middle line:10%
it looks like
they're vaporizing,

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:48.010 align:middle line:10%
but that's not the
right word, as you say.

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:49.989 align:middle line:10%
It's dustifying.

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:52.570 align:middle line:10%
They're just they're
there and they're solid

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:56.170 align:middle line:10%
and then they start becoming
almost like apparitions

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:57.880 align:middle line:10%
and then they're gone.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.410 align:middle line:10%
In the same shape.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:01.450 align:middle line:10%
>> I would like to point
out something here that

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:05.230 align:middle line:10%
my detractors say,
well, it fell down.

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:06.430 align:middle line:10%
So what if it fell down?

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:08.305 align:middle line:10%
You still need to explain
what happened here.

00:35:08.305 --> 00:35:10.150 align:middle line:10%
Because in the first
image, the building

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.730 align:middle line:10%
is coming apart right
next to it and going down

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:15.430 align:middle line:10%
or going wherever it's
going and it peels away

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:18.340 align:middle line:10%
like peeling a banana and you're
left with these core columns

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:19.420 align:middle line:10%
standing up.

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:20.362 align:middle line:10%
And they're crisp.

00:35:20.362 --> 00:35:21.820 align:middle line:10%
You have blue sky
in the background

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.740 align:middle line:10%
and they have crisp edges.

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.570 align:middle line:10%
And then you see
them getting fuzzy,

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:29.090 align:middle line:10%
and then you see
just fuzz there.

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:30.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Fuzz.

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:32.620 align:middle line:10%
But in the same shape, in
the same place, the fuzz.

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:33.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.710 align:middle line:10%
And my detractors
say, well, it shook up

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:38.530 align:middle line:10%
dust that was resting
on it that it settled

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.540 align:middle line:10%
on it before it
dropped because it's

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.250 align:middle line:10%
so fine it hung in the air.

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:45.903 align:middle line:10%
Well if dust is that so
fine that hung in the air,

00:35:45.903 --> 00:35:47.820 align:middle line:10%
how come you didn't see
it in the first frame?

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:48.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.080 align:middle line:10%
I was going to say,
you wouldn't-- yeah.

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:49.880 align:middle line:10%
Exactly.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:56.790 align:middle line:10%
>> How did it settle instantly
and then hang in the air later?

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:58.710 align:middle line:10%
So this argument
stands regardless

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:00.300 align:middle line:10%
of if you say it fell over.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:04.260 align:middle line:10%
I can't imagine how a 700
foot tall column could

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.950 align:middle line:10%
drop into a hole in the ground.

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:06.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:07.620 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:09.355 align:middle line:10%
There was no evidence for that.

00:36:09.355 --> 00:36:11.730 align:middle line:10%
>> And it didn't tip over
because it would take out a few

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:12.970 align:middle line:10%
blocks worth of buildings.

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:13.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:17.080 align:middle line:10%
So there's no evidence
for it falling down.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:23.140 align:middle line:10%
>> And going into the whole
theory of the controlled

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:26.400 align:middle line:10%
demolition, I mean, we haven't
really talked about any

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.250 align:middle line:10%
of the science.

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:30.130 align:middle line:10%
But you have very specific--

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:33.280 align:middle line:10%
many pages in the book
devoted to why even

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.460 align:middle line:10%
the idea of a
nano-thermite technology

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:40.330 align:middle line:10%
could not have been the source
of bringing down the buildings.

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:44.110 align:middle line:10%
Could you go ahead and explain
in only minimally scientific

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:46.040 align:middle line:10%
terms what that's about?

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.040 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.620 align:middle line:10%
In a way, it's that--

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:55.810 align:middle line:10%
well, I say by thermite,
do you mean powdered

00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:59.050 align:middle line:10%
aluminum and powdered iron rust?

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:00.470 align:middle line:10%
That's what thermite
is typically.

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:01.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:01.880 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.810 align:middle line:10%
>> And I have no doubt that
that was there in the dust

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:06.242 align:middle line:10%
because that's my point.

00:37:06.242 --> 00:37:08.200 align:middle line:10%
The buildings turned to
dust, and the buildings

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.630 align:middle line:10%
were made out of
steel structures

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:12.440 align:middle line:10%
with aluminum cladding.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:16.570 align:middle line:10%
So if that turned to dust
and nano-sized particles,

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:18.340 align:middle line:10%
that's what you'd
have in the dust.

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:23.440 align:middle line:10%
>> And not only that, you were
seeing evidence of very rapid

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:27.795 align:middle line:10%
rusting of certain of the pieces
that would go way beyond any

00:37:27.795 --> 00:37:29.920 align:middle line:10%
kind of rusting process
that would normally happen.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.510 align:middle line:10%
As though it was
rusting on speed.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:33.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:37.720 align:middle line:10%
If you've ever left an iron
skillet in the sink soaking

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:41.230 align:middle line:10%
and you scrubbed it so it's
really clean in one area,

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:45.250 align:middle line:10%
that area pretty soon turns
bright orange from the rust

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:46.630 align:middle line:10%
because it's pure iron.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:48.040 align:middle line:10%
Pure iron will rust.

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:52.720 align:middle line:10%
Steel structures have--
that type of steel has other

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.010 align:middle line:10%
components--

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:57.460 align:middle line:10%
carbon and other
add-ins that enhance

00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:01.480 align:middle line:10%
its structural properties
and enhance its ability

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:06.560 align:middle line:10%
to resist environmental
degradation from rust.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.880 align:middle line:10%
So if this rusts
quickly, that means

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.700 align:middle line:10%
its properties have changed.

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.400 align:middle line:10%
And if it lets go of
these other doodads,

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:20.260 align:middle line:10%
like the iron molecules
separate from the carbon,

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:23.920 align:middle line:10%
like the surface is
partly dissolved,

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.640 align:middle line:10%
that would explain
instant rusting.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:26.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.450 align:middle line:10%
That would explain it.

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:30.520 align:middle line:10%
But what would it take for that
to happen for these molecules

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:31.660 align:middle line:10%
to part?

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Molecular dissociation.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.960 align:middle line:10%
How could that happen?

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Well usually molecules
are attracted to each other

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:40.120 align:middle line:10%
and locked on to each other.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:42.360 align:middle line:10%
And let's say somehow
you could turn a switch

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:46.300 align:middle line:10%
and cause them to do the
reverse, to repel each other.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.540 align:middle line:10%
That is what it looked like was
happening when this building

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:52.750 align:middle line:10%
kind of billowed out into dust.

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:56.120 align:middle line:10%
>> What could cause that?

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:59.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Certain types of
energy fields interfering.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:00.020 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:02.310 align:middle line:10%
Well, we're going to get
to that in a second then

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:03.960 align:middle line:10%
in a little more detail.

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:08.960 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to continue on this
whole area with the steel beams

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:12.560 align:middle line:10%
and the supposed
debris and rusting.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:15.980 align:middle line:10%
But the steel, I think, we all
remember where they said, well,

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.200 align:middle line:10%
all this excess steel--

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.900 align:middle line:10%
steel scrap-- was
shipped to China.

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:25.760 align:middle line:10%
Now, what you're saying here
is that by September 13th

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.610 align:middle line:10%
in the morning--

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:29.570 align:middle line:10%
so that would have
to mean on the 12th--

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:30.530 align:middle line:10%
what?

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:32.405 align:middle line:10%
>> Actually some of
those pictures were taken

00:39:32.405 --> 00:39:34.710 align:middle line:10%
on the 11th, but they weren't
logged in til the 12th.

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:39.830 align:middle line:10%
So just to be extra safe,
I used the caption date.

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:44.130 align:middle line:10%
But if you look at the camera
info data, it's the 11th.

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:44.930 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:45.740 align:middle line:10%
So here we are.

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:48.500 align:middle line:10%
People are literally just
trying to get the dust

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:50.660 align:middle line:10%
off their clothing
and shake their head

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.190 align:middle line:10%
and figure out
what just happened

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:54.320 align:middle line:10%
to me, what just happened
to this city, what

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.700 align:middle line:10%
happened to everybody else.

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, this deal
had already been scooped up

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:02.660 align:middle line:90%
and shipped off to China?

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:06.080 align:middle line:10%
Pretty good cover
story, isn't it?

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it's stupid.

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:10.730 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that's just stupid.

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:13.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Towards the beginning, to get
a lighthearted moment, I'd say,

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.730 align:middle line:10%
oh, where is that steel-- oh,
it's hiding across the street

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:18.770 align:middle line:10%
under that hubcap.

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:20.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the point is,
where was the steel?

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:23.360 align:middle line:10%
I mean how much steel are
we talking about here, A,

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:24.800 align:middle line:10%
that was shipped off to China?

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.130 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.930 align:middle line:10%
How much?

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:28.400 align:middle line:10%
I mean, what did they say
they had managed to accumulate

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.900 align:middle line:10%
and ship to China?

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.120 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm guessing
there's two beams,

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.780 align:middle line:10%
because then they could
say "beams" plural.

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:37.400 align:middle line:10%
It might be lying.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.733 align:middle line:10%
>> The point is, there wasn't
a lot of steel to ship off

00:40:39.733 --> 00:40:40.533 align:middle line:10%
to China.

00:40:40.533 --> 00:40:41.360 align:middle line:10%
But what a story.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.310 align:middle line:10%
Oh, we had our people on it.

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:44.280 align:middle line:10%
We were prepared.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:47.240 align:middle line:10%
We had these massive steel
beams-- lots of them piled up--

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.190 align:middle line:10%
shipped them off to
China within 24 hours

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:50.570 align:middle line:10%
of the building going down.

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:54.135 align:middle line:10%
I mean when I say "stupid," I
mean it's absolutely absurd.

00:40:54.135 --> 00:40:55.010 align:middle line:10%
>> It makes no sense.

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:56.210 align:middle line:10%
>> It makes no sense.

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:57.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly.

00:40:57.230 --> 00:41:01.980 align:middle line:10%
And those columns that
dustified before our very eyes--

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:02.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes?

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The base of those, I believe,
is stairwell B and there are 14

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:09.110 align:middle line:84%
people who survived
in stairwell B.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:12.090 align:middle line:84%
The rest of building dustified
around them and they were left

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:13.040 align:middle line:90%
in stairwell B.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:16.000 align:middle line:10%
>> And when they came out--

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.070 align:middle line:10%
one of the firefighters
looked and said, guys,

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:21.560 align:middle line:10%
there used to be
106 floors above us

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.428 align:middle line:10%
and now I'm seeing sunshine.

00:41:23.428 --> 00:41:24.470 align:middle line:10%
There's nothing above us.

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:26.870 align:middle line:10%
That big building doesn't exist.

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:29.690 align:middle line:10%
They later said, these are
the biggest office buildings

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:33.470 align:middle line:10%
in the world and I didn't see
one desk, one chair, one phone,

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:35.300 align:middle line:10%
nothing.

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:41.140 align:middle line:10%
And yet, there was another
photo there of something

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:43.380 align:middle line:10%
that was showing up
in the debris later.

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:46.680 align:middle line:10%
I can't remember what
building it came from now,

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:50.070 align:middle line:10%
and it was just the
oddest photograph

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:53.790 align:middle line:10%
because it was of a
ball of compressed metal

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:55.750 align:middle line:10%
from the Ben and Jerry's store.

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:56.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:57.970 align:middle line:10%
>> That had little--

00:41:57.970 --> 00:41:58.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:02.550 align:middle line:10%
Like a football they had
intact pieces of $20 bills--

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:05.760 align:middle line:10%
corners of $20-- bills sticking
out of this compressed metal.

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.220 align:middle line:10%
This makes no sense.

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:09.300 align:middle line:10%
>> And colored dividers.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:10.590 align:middle line:10%
>> And colored dividers.

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:11.390 align:middle line:10%
I mean it--

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:15.760 align:middle line:10%
>> It was the only
file cabinet found.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.220 align:middle line:10%
>> I mean, how did they even
know it was a file cabinet?

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:20.530 align:middle line:10%
It looked like a
football of metal.

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:21.490 align:middle line:10%
>> That's true.

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:25.180 align:middle line:10%
And they were able to identify
what store it was from.

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:27.890 align:middle line:10%
And they called up the
store owner, and said,

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:30.450 align:middle line:10%
hey we got your money and
they gave them their money--

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:31.600 align:middle line:10%
his money.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.430 align:middle line:10%
The Ben and Jerry's store owner.

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:36.520 align:middle line:10%
>> You mean the money that was
twisted up inside that football

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:37.320 align:middle line:10%
or was there some--

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:39.100 align:middle line:10%
>> That was weird.

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:40.990 align:middle line:10%
I mean how can that
happen that you

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:44.800 align:middle line:10%
have this densely-compacted
metal with totally intact

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:47.470 align:middle line:10%
pieces of paper sticking out?

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:48.680 align:middle line:10%
>> It didn't burn.

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.480 align:middle line:10%
>> It didn't burn.

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.640 align:middle line:10%
And again, the same thing
happens over and over.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.032 align:middle line:10%
Papers seem to be intact.

00:42:53.032 --> 00:42:54.490 align:middle line:10%
There are papers
floating all over.

00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:56.260 align:middle line:10%
In fact, papers came
down before the dust

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:59.740 align:middle line:10%
came down, and this
whole subject of paper

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:03.430 align:middle line:10%
near cars that had just
been not incinerated.

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:04.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Toasted.

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:05.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Toasted.

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:07.690 align:middle line:10%
These cars that had
been toasted all around

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:10.960 align:middle line:10%
are these flutters of paper that
had landed around these cars

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.310 align:middle line:10%
and yet, they were
totally intact.

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:17.920 align:middle line:10%
>> And there's some images where
you have this orange glowing

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:19.303 align:middle line:10%
piece of material.

00:43:19.303 --> 00:43:21.220 align:middle line:10%
We don't know what it
is, but something orange

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:25.860 align:middle line:10%
and glowing sitting on paper
and the paper's not burning.

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:26.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:27.310 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:28.110 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:30.740 align:middle line:10%
So I mean, we're just
now adding more evidence

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.362 align:middle line:10%
to the weirdness of
this whole thing.

00:43:32.362 --> 00:43:34.820 align:middle line:10%
I'm not asking you to step out
on a limb beyond what you've

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:37.850 align:middle line:10%
already done, which is huge.

00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:42.180 align:middle line:10%
>> What I say about that is, we
do know that hot things glow.

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:42.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:46.760 align:middle line:10%
>> But also not everything
that glows is hot.

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.735 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:43:47.735 --> 00:43:50.360 align:middle line:10%
>> We can compare a fluorescent
light bulb with an incandescent

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.830 align:middle line:10%
light bulb.

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:56.100 align:middle line:10%
There's two different
phenomena going on there.

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.910 align:middle line:10%
Also there's
fireflies that glow.

00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:58.710 align:middle line:10%
>> That's true.

00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:59.510 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:03.970 align:middle line:10%
And so there was this
phenomena that was occurring.

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:07.710 align:middle line:10%
And again, I mean, you
have all these people that

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:09.210 align:middle line:10%
went through this experience.

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:10.700 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we can just--

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:11.500 align:middle line:10%
and we will.

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:13.500 align:middle line:10%
I have more things I want
to ask you about here.

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:18.660 align:middle line:10%
But it's just one surreal, odd
bit of evidence after another.

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.430 align:middle line:10%
None of it stacks
to anything that's

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:23.520 align:middle line:10%
been spoken of up
until this time.

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.080 align:middle line:10%
And you have people--

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:31.320 align:middle line:10%
Tim McGinn, you mentioned--
he said to the people that--

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.750 align:middle line:10%
he was one of the
witnesses said, basically,

00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:36.060 align:middle line:10%
where the F are the towers?

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:37.050 align:middle line:10%
What happened?

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:38.430 align:middle line:10%
Where's the debris?

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:41.640 align:middle line:10%
Everyone was just standing there
as though they were in a daze.

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:42.900 align:middle line:10%
What just happened?

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:43.920 align:middle line:10%
Where's the sound?

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:44.940 align:middle line:10%
Where's the collapse?

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:46.960 align:middle line:10%
Where are the towers?

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.840 align:middle line:10%
>> That's when
they were trapped--

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:51.440 align:middle line:10%
those 14 people were
trapped in the stairwell,

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:54.330 align:middle line:10%
they're on their handy talkies
calling for their buddies

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:56.370 align:middle line:10%
to come rescue them.

00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:57.930 align:middle line:10%
Where are you?

00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:59.070 align:middle line:10%
Stairwell B, Tower 1.

00:44:59.070 --> 00:44:59.870 align:middle line:10%
Where?

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:05.091 align:middle line:10%
Tower 1 stairwell
B. Where's Tower 1?

00:45:05.091 --> 00:45:07.960 align:middle line:10%
They thought these voices
were coming out of nowhere.

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, there's
nothing funny about it.

00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:14.640 align:middle line:10%
But, again, everything about
this is so absurd and extreme.

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.870 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things
that you show in this book

00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:22.140 align:middle line:10%
is when you have a
traditional kind of explosion,

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:23.640 align:middle line:10%
such as the
controlled demolition,

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:27.450 align:middle line:10%
you have a certain kind of
window breakage and so forth.

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:30.870 align:middle line:10%
The signatures of the
glass that was broken

00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:34.140 align:middle line:10%
wasn't anything like a normal
demolition though, was it?

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:35.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, more than that.

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:37.980 align:middle line:10%
Very much different.

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:41.590 align:middle line:10%
Think about this
mental exercise.

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:43.350 align:middle line:10%
Whether it's
pancaking down its own

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:46.140 align:middle line:10%
or you have countercharges
chopping things up

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.870 align:middle line:10%
and the junk's coming
down, whatever the case is,

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:50.730 align:middle line:10%
if that stuff lands
on the ground, squirts

00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:54.600 align:middle line:10%
stuff out the
side, at that time,

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:57.180 align:middle line:10%
if it's taken eight seconds
to come down or 10 seconds

00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:01.140 align:middle line:10%
to come down, by the time
it gets to the ground,

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:05.760 align:middle line:10%
that stuff is squirting out of
there at mach one to mach two.

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.680 align:middle line:10%
And if that stuff
is shooting out,

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:11.640 align:middle line:10%
we're talking about a soda
pop can-- everything becomes

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:14.040 align:middle line:10%
a projectile and pieces of junk.

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.310 align:middle line:10%
And it would be--

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:18.690 align:middle line:10%
all the shrapnel would
be hitting every building

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:19.620 align:middle line:10%
around the complex.

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:20.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:23.550 align:middle line:10%
>> You'd have
pockmarks all over.

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:27.660 align:middle line:10%
Yet, the facade of these
buildings is nearly pristine.

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:29.280 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't have all
this-- it doesn't

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:34.380 align:middle line:10%
look like it was sandblasted or
had a rocket launcher shooting

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:35.610 align:middle line:10%
all sorts of trash at it.

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:38.160 align:middle line:10%


00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:43.120 align:middle line:10%
Except, we have rounded
holes in windows.

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.610 align:middle line:10%
The outer pane, while the
inner pane is still intact.

00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:46.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:48.420 align:middle line:10%
That was bizarre.

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:52.140 align:middle line:10%
>> How do you get a professional
glass cutter to even do that?

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:53.550 align:middle line:10%
I don't think you could.

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:59.100 align:middle line:10%
>> How would an energy
device even do that?

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:04.580 align:middle line:10%
>> As it turns out, longitudinal
energy waves do this.

00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:08.840 align:middle line:10%
I hypothesized how the
mechanics would be.

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:12.150 align:middle line:10%
Imagine if you dropped
a rock in a pond.

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.950 align:middle line:10%
Still pond.

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:15.830 align:middle line:10%
You see the ripples go
outward, because you'd

00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:20.300 align:middle line:10%
displaced the water laterally.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:23.600 align:middle line:10%
It seems to be-- and it
would be the round wakes.

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:29.090 align:middle line:10%
So if you shoot an
energy beam at a window,

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:31.550 align:middle line:10%
you might get the same kind
of thing rippling outward,

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:34.490 align:middle line:10%
like a rock going through water.

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:38.060 align:middle line:10%
When a physical object
like a rock hits a window,

00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:43.730 align:middle line:10%
it bends it and bows out
very instantaneously.

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:47.350 align:middle line:10%
And glass, because it's
a brittle material,

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:49.600 align:middle line:10%
can't handle being
put in tension.

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.000 align:middle line:10%
And when it bows out
from the rock hitting it,

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.350 align:middle line:10%
the opposite side is in
tension and it breaks.

00:47:56.350 --> 00:48:00.025 align:middle line:10%
So what this says is it
breaks the whole window.

00:48:00.025 --> 00:48:01.570 align:middle line:10%
You get cracks
all over the place

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:03.300 align:middle line:10%
in a spiderweb-like pattern.

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:06.920 align:middle line:10%
Anyone whose thrown a
baseball through window.

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:08.470 align:middle line:10%
The window gets trashed.

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:12.140 align:middle line:10%
You don't make round hole
in the middle of a window.

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:15.520 align:middle line:10%
So this is something
else doing that.

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:20.190 align:middle line:10%
And as it turns out, that
can be replicated in the lab

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:22.330 align:middle line:10%
with longitudinal energy waves.

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:23.130 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:25.380 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to
go to that again

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:28.990 align:middle line:10%
in just a little bit once we get
through all the evidence here.

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:33.930 align:middle line:10%
There was another odd little
bit here about some molten steel

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:36.750 align:middle line:10%
and steel toed boots.

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:39.510 align:middle line:10%
But apparently, the flesh
of the person didn't burn.

00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:41.940 align:middle line:10%
Did I understand that correctly?

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:44.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Steel toed boots is
one of the biggest things.

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:45.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Steel toed boots?

00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:46.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Steel toed boots.

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:51.860 align:middle line:10%
Out still on the rubble, it's
still, I believe 1,100 degrees.

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:55.370 align:middle line:10%
The guy's boots just
melt within a few hours.

00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:56.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:57.837 align:middle line:10%
There there's a lot
of stories like this

00:48:57.837 --> 00:49:02.620 align:middle line:10%
that get repeated over and over
again because in that moment,

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:03.550 align:middle line:10%
people have questions.

00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:04.780 align:middle line:10%
They need answers.

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.783 align:middle line:10%
As soon as they're given
answers, they go on.

00:49:06.783 --> 00:49:08.200 align:middle line:10%
They don't stop
to think if that's

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:13.073 align:middle line:10%
a reasonable answer in this
moment of traumatic events.

00:49:13.073 --> 00:49:14.990 align:middle line:10%
And they just repeat
them over and over again,

00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:16.300 align:middle line:10%
and people keep repeating them.

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:19.510 align:middle line:10%
And even the truth
movement, you keep

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:21.640 align:middle line:10%
repeating the story about
steel toed boots were

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:24.040 align:middle line:10%
melting because it was so hot.

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:27.850 align:middle line:10%
Well, if you put
something on your grill

00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:32.830 align:middle line:10%
that hot that's
going to melt steel,

00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:34.990 align:middle line:10%
you're not going to be
surviving through that.

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:middle line:10%
And as I like to say, if
my steel oven is melting,

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.110 align:middle line:10%
the turkey inside is
more than well done.

00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:43.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:46.110 align:middle line:10%
>> But we have no
reports of burnt feet.

00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:47.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:47.280 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.363 align:middle line:10%
That's what I was reading.

00:49:48.363 --> 00:49:50.440 align:middle line:10%
So go ahead.

00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:53.510 align:middle line:10%
>> But what it captures is
something is reminding someone

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:54.310 align:middle line:10%
of this.

00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:57.030 align:middle line:10%
They're describing what's
happening the best they can.

00:49:57.030 --> 00:50:01.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I have a little note
here in the sidelines that

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:02.460 align:middle line:10%
the heat was--

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:04.100 align:middle line:10%
the heat would
normally be, what,

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:07.440 align:middle line:10%
at 1,100 degrees or so to
create the molten steel?

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.730 align:middle line:10%
Did I write that down correctly?

00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:10.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Maybe.

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:15.620 align:middle line:10%
It's like 1,500 centigrade
or 2,800 Fahrenheit.

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:16.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, OK.

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:17.270 align:middle line:10%
All right.

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Way out there.

00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:18.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Way.

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:21.000 align:middle line:10%
>> It's definitely going to
have your turkey overcooked with

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:21.120 align:middle line:10%
that.

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.570 align:middle line:10%
>> You're going to have
your tootsies burned.

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:23.490 align:middle line:10%
That's for sure.

00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:24.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:30.060 align:middle line:10%
And there's no reports of burnt
feet or burned bones or toes

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:33.510 align:middle line:10%
but the boots apparently
were disintegrating.

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:37.217 align:middle line:10%
There's also a story
about the last guy out,

00:50:37.217 --> 00:50:39.300 align:middle line:10%
they knew he just got out
by the skin of his teeth

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:42.940 align:middle line:10%
because his shoes were
blown clear off his feet.

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:44.460 align:middle line:10%
That's what his friend said.

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:45.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Wow.

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:46.770 align:middle line:10%
So here we have--

00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:48.392 align:middle line:10%
I mean, just now
kind of going back

00:50:48.392 --> 00:50:50.100 align:middle line:10%
at some of the things
we've talked about,

00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:51.690 align:middle line:10%
some of these oddities.

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:54.630 align:middle line:10%
We have steel melting
that would normally

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:58.770 align:middle line:10%
melt at very high temperatures
without burning people's feet.

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:02.640 align:middle line:10%
We have windows where a
hole has been blown out

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:06.040 align:middle line:10%
of one pane but
not the other pane.

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:08.850 align:middle line:10%
We have cars that
have been toasted,

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:12.810 align:middle line:10%
and the other half of the car
can be absolutely pristine.

00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:18.000 align:middle line:10%
People who are-- 1,200 of them--
who totally against anything

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.570 align:middle line:10%
in human nature are
jumping or falling

00:51:21.570 --> 00:51:24.870 align:middle line:10%
are on the outside of this
building at 105 floors

00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:28.230 align:middle line:10%
and below jumping or
falling to their deaths,

00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:32.670 align:middle line:10%
but they seem to be almost
microwaved from the inside

00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:35.610 align:middle line:10%
because they're coming
down in body parts.

00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:38.220 align:middle line:10%
That's not normal for freefall.

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:41.452 align:middle line:10%
Big steel beams that
appear in these pictures.

00:51:41.452 --> 00:51:43.410 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it looks to me
like they're dustifying.

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:44.493 align:middle line:10%
We just talked about that.

00:51:44.493 --> 00:51:46.980 align:middle line:10%
They didn't fall over.

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:49.500 align:middle line:10%
Cars that are blowing
up seven blocks--

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.840 align:middle line:10%
or toasting seven blocks away.

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.120 align:middle line:10%
Vehicles blowing up.

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:56.760 align:middle line:10%
All these things going on
that don't make any sense

00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:00.570 align:middle line:10%
whatsoever for any kind
of normal demolition

00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:01.640 align:middle line:10%
that we're talking about.

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:04.200 align:middle line:10%
Now, I want to ask you
about this because you've

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.390 align:middle line:10%
gotten a lot of--

00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:12.450 align:middle line:10%
you've drawn a lot of heat
from the 9/11 Truth Movement

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:14.940 align:middle line:10%
who have bought
into the story this

00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:16.620 align:middle line:10%
was a controlled demolition.

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:20.220 align:middle line:10%
My question is, why
aren't they more--

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:23.260 align:middle line:10%
why do you think they might not
be more open to this evidence

00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:24.060 align:middle line:10%
here?

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:26.580 align:middle line:10%
It seems like everybody's
looking for the truth on this.

00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:29.850 align:middle line:10%
Why is there any resistance
among these professionals

00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:31.700 align:middle line:10%
to look at your work seriously?

00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:34.110 align:middle line:10%
Or are they starting
to do that now?

00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:38.350 align:middle line:10%
>> 9/11 was a
psychological operation,

00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:42.840 align:middle line:10%
including the thermite story,
the bombs in the building story

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:44.490 align:middle line:10%
that were planted there.

00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:48.930 align:middle line:10%
Like, NIST had their
press conference

00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:52.380 align:middle line:10%
talking about the release
of the Building 7 report.

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:56.310 align:middle line:10%
They had this neat
and tidy false choice.

00:52:56.310 --> 00:52:58.740 align:middle line:10%
And in my comments to them--

00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:02.910 align:middle line:10%
I called them on that and
notified them of fraud--

00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:07.140 align:middle line:10%
that they were guilty
of fraud because they

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:12.170 align:middle line:10%
denied the bombs of the building
story by saying it was silent.

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:15.630 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't any loud
noise associated with it

00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:17.460 align:middle line:10%
so it couldn't be
bombs in the building.

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:21.240 align:middle line:10%
But they didn't apply
that to their own story.

00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:23.420 align:middle line:10%
The building came
crashing down, it

00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:27.870 align:middle line:10%
should sound like it was raining
dump trucks, and it was silent.

00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:31.290 align:middle line:10%
So that also
dismisses their story.

00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:34.480 align:middle line:10%
They contradicted
their own story.

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:37.470 align:middle line:10%
>> So you're saying that
story about the thermite

00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:41.940 align:middle line:10%
and the controlled demolition
was also planted to manage

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:43.870 align:middle line:10%
impressions?

00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:44.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Very much.

00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:45.470 align:middle line:10%
Very much.

00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:47.760 align:middle line:10%
Even on that day, we
had Dan Rather saying,

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:50.160 align:middle line:10%
it looks like a
controlled demolition.

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:54.800 align:middle line:10%
There's Van Romero that
afternoon said it was--

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.640 align:middle line:10%
he was sure it was a
controlled demolition.

00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.390 align:middle line:10%
It would only take a
few explosives do it.

00:53:58.390 --> 00:54:00.690 align:middle line:10%
But a week later,
he retracted it.

00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:03.540 align:middle line:10%
And then right after, he got
$85 million in grant money.

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:04.740 align:middle line:10%
So it must be true.

00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:07.650 align:middle line:10%
Turns out, a year
before 9/11, he

00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:11.820 align:middle line:10%
did a short course-- gave a
short course on energy weapons

00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:14.220 align:middle line:10%
at the Directed Energy
Professional Society's

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:15.600 align:middle line:10%
annual meeting.

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.210 align:middle line:10%
So he knew what
he was looking at.

00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:18.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:21.690 align:middle line:10%
>> So it wasn't a mistake
of what he was looking at.

00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:23.760 align:middle line:10%
There's all these Easter
eggs, I call them,

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.740 align:middle line:10%
that we've left out,
like an Easter egg

00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:27.342 align:middle line:10%
hunt for a three-year-old.

00:54:27.342 --> 00:54:28.800 align:middle line:10%
When the three-year-old
finds them,

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:30.990 align:middle line:10%
they think they've really
found something important

00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:34.420 align:middle line:10%
and they hang on to it like
Larry Silverstein's "pull it."

00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:35.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:37.590 align:middle line:10%
I was just going to ask
you that exact question.

00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:40.020 align:middle line:10%
Please tell us more about
that because a lot of people

00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:41.880 align:middle line:10%
saw that in the
film "Loose Change."

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:44.430 align:middle line:10%
I saw it, and it's Larry
Silverstein saying, oh, yeah,

00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:46.825 align:middle line:10%
we had to pull it.

00:54:46.825 --> 00:54:50.090 align:middle line:10%
>> It's sort of silly because
what are they saying that

00:54:50.090 --> 00:54:52.040 align:middle line:10%
firefighters go around
with sticks of dynamite

00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:54.163 align:middle line:10%
in their back
pocket just in case?

00:54:54.163 --> 00:54:56.580 align:middle line:10%
They fight fires with sticks
of dynamite in their pockets?

00:54:56.580 --> 00:55:00.590 align:middle line:10%
>> But why would Larry
Silverstein say that?

00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I said, you know, we've had
such terrible loss of life.

00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:07.510 align:middle line:10%
Maybe the smartest
thing to do is pull it,

00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:09.570 align:middle line:10%
and they made that
decision to pull

00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:13.970 align:middle line:10%
and then we watched
the building collapse.

00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:17.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Who knows if it was something
that was taken out of context

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:21.110 align:middle line:10%
or if he was putting out the
Easter egg or what it was,

00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:22.640 align:middle line:10%
but it makes no sense.

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:23.450 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:26.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Because fire departments
are not in the business

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:27.740 align:middle line:10%
of controlled demolition.

00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:30.050 align:middle line:10%
Plus, if you don't
know what the story is,

00:55:30.050 --> 00:55:31.970 align:middle line:10%
you can't size up the event.

00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:34.370 align:middle line:10%
You don't know where the
damage is in the building.

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:36.705 align:middle line:10%
If you're going to chuck
in that piece of dynamite,

00:55:36.705 --> 00:55:38.330 align:middle line:10%
lodge it in there,
where do you put it?

00:55:38.330 --> 00:55:39.788 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, well, not
only that, I mean,

00:55:39.788 --> 00:55:42.230 align:middle line:10%
if it were a traditional
controlled demolition,

00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:46.130 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't it have taken weeks
or even months to prepare?

00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:47.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:51.320 align:middle line:10%
There's so much about it
that doesn't make sense.

00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:53.270 align:middle line:10%
Plus if you had
controlled demolition,

00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:55.550 align:middle line:10%
it breaks buildings into
chunks, and the chunks

00:55:55.550 --> 00:55:57.030 align:middle line:10%
slam to the ground.

00:55:57.030 --> 00:56:00.620 align:middle line:10%
With Building 7, that is
indeed the smoking gun.

00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:04.160 align:middle line:10%
There was essentially
no seismic signature

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.960 align:middle line:10%
of that building's demise.

00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Just a teeny bit-- like a
0.6 on the Richter scale.

00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:14.950 align:middle line:84%
That day, there were quarry
blasts over New Jersey

00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:15.880 align:middle line:90%
and Pennsylvania.

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.860 align:middle line:90%
Those were picked up.

00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:23.720 align:middle line:84%
But the demise of Building 7
didn't make a seismic impact?

00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:26.380 align:middle line:84%
It really stood out
from background noise,

00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and it's six times the potential
energy of the Seattle Kingdome.

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:34.100 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:36.400 align:middle line:10%
And you do a good job of
detailing that in the book.

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.830 align:middle line:10%
>> The Seattle
Kingdome made a 2.3.

00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:39.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:41.880 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:44.270 align:middle line:10%
Again, I mean, none of
this makes any sense.

00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:47.290 align:middle line:10%
What I'm wondering
here is, if you're

00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:51.880 align:middle line:10%
saying that this is part of the
mind control or disinformation

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:53.800 align:middle line:10%
that, like you say,
Dan Rather said,

00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.440 align:middle line:10%
it almost looks like a
controlled demolition.

00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:59.530 align:middle line:10%
If this was starting so
early on, what I don't get

00:56:59.530 --> 00:57:04.840 align:middle line:10%
is how would that support
the supposedly larger agenda

00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:10.030 align:middle line:10%
of creating this fear of the
Islamic world and everything

00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:14.950 align:middle line:10%
that we've gotten into
in the name of 9/11?

00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:19.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, look at how people argue
about opinions about thermite

00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:21.620 align:middle line:10%
or nukes or this or that.

00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:24.400 align:middle line:10%
And you get this
big huge muddle up

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:27.700 align:middle line:10%
and everyone's around
circles arguing.

00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:33.340 align:middle line:10%
It's really destroyed
people's ability to reason.

00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:36.230 align:middle line:10%
As you've seen in this book,
it's right in front of us.

00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:37.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:37.830 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:39.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Why don't people see it?

00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:43.600 align:middle line:10%
Because it was such a strong
psychological operation.

00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:47.390 align:middle line:10%
It destroyed people's
ability to know what's real

00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:48.190 align:middle line:10%
and what's not.

00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:50.880 align:middle line:10%


00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:53.050 align:middle line:10%
And they want to know
what the truth is,

00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:56.380 align:middle line:10%
and they run to this
truth movement business.

00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:58.630 align:middle line:10%
But as I point out,
do you think those

00:57:58.630 --> 00:58:02.190 align:middle line:10%
who pulled off 9/11 just
forgot to plan a cover up?

00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:02.990 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:04.500 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:06.410 align:middle line:10%
>> So what would it look like?

00:58:06.410 --> 00:58:07.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:58:07.210 --> 00:58:08.410 align:middle line:10%
Very true.

00:58:08.410 --> 00:58:11.560 align:middle line:10%
Well, now let's get
into the meat of what

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:14.350 align:middle line:10%
you're talking about here.

00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:16.302 align:middle line:10%
All of these anomalies--

00:58:16.302 --> 00:58:18.010 align:middle line:10%
and every single thing
we've talked about

00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:20.950 align:middle line:10%
is an anomaly, if you're
looking at the official story

00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:22.730 align:middle line:10%
or the controlled
demolition story.

00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:24.160 align:middle line:10%
Everything is anomalous.

00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:25.770 align:middle line:10%
It would make no sense.

00:58:25.770 --> 00:58:27.520 align:middle line:10%
But it does make sense
when you're talking

00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:30.760 align:middle line:10%
about directed energy weapons.

00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:34.300 align:middle line:10%
And you go into
Tesla's technology

00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:35.650 align:middle line:10%
a fair amount in here.

00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:40.210 align:middle line:10%
Can you begin-- just, again,
without being so scientific

00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:43.600 align:middle line:10%
that you're going to lose
the non-scientists among us,

00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.310 align:middle line:10%
you begin to talk over--

00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:47.990 align:middle line:10%
can you begin, at a
layperson's level,

00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:50.560 align:middle line:10%
talking about the
Tesla technology

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:54.700 align:middle line:10%
and what exactly could
have caused this weird kind

00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:56.290 align:middle line:10%
of damage across the board?

00:58:56.290 --> 00:59:01.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, first of all, not
knowing with this weapon was--

00:59:01.690 --> 00:59:03.310 align:middle line:10%
it's not a kinetic
energy weapon,

00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:05.890 align:middle line:10%
like a bomb or bullet
or something that throws

00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:08.860 align:middle line:10%
something and hits something.

00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:12.280 align:middle line:10%
Like if you throw a brick
at someone and hit them,

00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:15.520 align:middle line:10%
that's a kinetic energy weapon.

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:19.750 align:middle line:10%
A directed energy weapon as
is energy that's been directed

00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:21.310 align:middle line:10%
and was used as a weapon.

00:59:21.310 --> 00:59:23.380 align:middle line:10%
A very general category.

00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:25.850 align:middle line:10%
I don't know how else
to categorize it.

00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:30.350 align:middle line:10%
And, sure, there are lasers
and other things like that.

00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:32.300 align:middle line:10%
That's not what
I'm talking about.

00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:35.950 align:middle line:10%
I'm talking about an energy
field and field effects that

00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:36.890 align:middle line:10%
happen in a field.

00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:39.640 align:middle line:10%
And obviously the
energy was directed

00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:43.900 align:middle line:10%
because it is pretty precise
as to how it acted that day.

00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:49.730 align:middle line:10%
And it wasn't a random
orientation of energy.

00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:52.190 align:middle line:10%
Kinetic energy weapons
involve heat-- an expansion

00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:56.450 align:middle line:10%
of heat and sound waves.

00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:58.451 align:middle line:10%
Made things go boom.

00:59:58.451 --> 01:00:01.280 align:middle line:10%
>> That didn't happen, but it
was something that right before

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:05.240 align:middle line:10%
your eyes, you saw those
steel columns dustify.

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.880 align:middle line:10%
You didn't see anything hit it.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:14.660 align:middle line:10%
And that's the signature
there too of energy weapons

01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:16.020 align:middle line:10%
affecting it.

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:18.020 align:middle line:10%
But when I was
looking at the data--

01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:20.120 align:middle line:10%
and I believe in you look
at the data long enough,

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.170 align:middle line:10%
it'll tell you what happened.

01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:23.330 align:middle line:10%
If you don't know what
happened, just keep looking.

01:00:23.330 --> 01:00:26.630 align:middle line:10%
And I kept tabulating all the
different characteristics,

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:28.760 align:middle line:10%
and I'd give them
whatever names came

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.970 align:middle line:10%
to mind as unique descriptions.

01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:32.970 align:middle line:10%
Like "fuzz balls."

01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:36.170 align:middle line:10%
We didn't talk much about that.

01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:39.230 align:middle line:10%
The columns as they're
falling turned to dust.

01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:43.100 align:middle line:10%
That dust lands and you have
clear blue sky behind it.

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:46.500 align:middle line:10%
And then that dust starts
breaking down and rising up.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:49.030 align:middle line:10%
So we know the dust
continued breaking down.

01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:51.590 align:middle line:10%
And at first, it was kicked
up around people's feet,

01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:53.180 align:middle line:10%
and I called those fuzz balls.

01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:58.070 align:middle line:10%
And then after a while, you
notice it's rising on its own.

01:00:58.070 --> 01:00:59.030 align:middle line:10%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:01.670 align:middle line:10%
>> As in anti-gavitational?

01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:05.540 align:middle line:10%
>> As it being so fine
that it just floats up.

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:06.380 align:middle line:10%
>> I see.

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:06.650 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:07.580 align:middle line:10%
No mass.

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:08.500 align:middle line:10%
Very little mass.

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.450 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

01:01:10.450 --> 01:01:15.230 align:middle line:10%
>> And also, the dust rollout,
when the dust rollout first

01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:20.000 align:middle line:10%
occurred, it comes to an abrupt
stop at a particular street.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.730 align:middle line:10%
When the South Tower
first went, it rolled out

01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:25.070 align:middle line:10%
to the north up to one street.

01:01:25.070 --> 01:01:27.350 align:middle line:10%
And then when the North
Tower when, it rolled up one

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:28.430 align:middle line:10%
block further.

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:30.640 align:middle line:10%
The towers are one block
apart from each other.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, that's bizarre.

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:35.690 align:middle line:10%
So there was somehow a
controlled extension of this?

01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:40.120 align:middle line:10%
Or was it natural to the dynamic
of whatever destroyed it?

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:40.920 align:middle line:10%
>> The latter.

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:43.337 align:middle line:10%
I think it is natural to the
dynamic of what destroyed it.

01:01:43.337 --> 01:01:45.330 align:middle line:10%
If it's breaking down
at a certain rate--

01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:48.110 align:middle line:10%
you can get a rock and throw it
pretty far, but how far can you

01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:50.110 align:middle line:10%
throw flour?

01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:51.122 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

01:01:51.122 --> 01:01:53.330 align:middle line:10%
>> And so if this is breaking
down at a certain rate,

01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:56.330 align:middle line:10%
it gets down to certain size,
then it just quits going

01:01:56.330 --> 01:01:59.550 align:middle line:10%
further and then it just floats.

01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:00.560 align:middle line:10%
Floats with the wind.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:05.070 align:middle line:10%
And there was this amazing video
from Bob and Bri's apartment

01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:07.915 align:middle line:10%
that they took, and you
could see the dust almost

01:02:07.915 --> 01:02:08.790 align:middle line:10%
came to their window.

01:02:08.790 --> 01:02:10.730 align:middle line:10%
It didn't quite
touch their window

01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:14.480 align:middle line:10%
and then started rising
up like yeast bread.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.450 align:middle line:10%
It's just amazing.

01:02:16.450 --> 01:02:19.250 align:middle line:10%
>> So all these different
phenomena that I was

01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:23.180 align:middle line:10%
tabulating, including the
peeling effect on cars.

01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:25.440 align:middle line:10%
Like the split
thickness of the door

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.810 align:middle line:10%
would peel, which these
are not laminated doors,

01:02:28.810 --> 01:02:31.730 align:middle line:10%
so why does it look
like it's delaminating?

01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:33.860 align:middle line:10%
And you just keep
add these things.

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:36.110 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know what it
meant and I didn't force it

01:02:36.110 --> 01:02:40.100 align:middle line:10%
into any particular conclusion.

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:42.290 align:middle line:10%
If somebody takes a
multiple choice test,

01:02:42.290 --> 01:02:44.990 align:middle line:10%
they're forcing things
into a particular slots

01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:46.670 align:middle line:10%
of what they know of.

01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:48.770 align:middle line:10%
Instead, I was letting
the data speak.

01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:53.480 align:middle line:10%
And then one day, I happened
upon a blog of someone.

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:56.750 align:middle line:10%
And my goodness, these
looked like they came

01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:58.080 align:middle line:10%
from the World Trade Center.

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:03.540 align:middle line:10%
But wait, this guy did
it in his own apartment.

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:07.130 align:middle line:10%
He had reproduced all
of the same phenomena

01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:10.490 align:middle line:10%
that I had noticed, including
that split thickness.

01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:14.060 align:middle line:10%
He had a piece of aluminum
that split open, including

01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:16.490 align:middle line:10%
things dustifying, loading up.

01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:19.860 align:middle line:10%
The fumes that rose up--

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:22.870 align:middle line:10%
I don't call it dust because you
don't know exactly what it is.

01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:25.940 align:middle line:10%
Not fuzz balls, but fuzzy
blobs, but something else.

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:28.640 align:middle line:10%
It's just haze
that drifts around.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:31.200 align:middle line:10%
And he actually
had a name for it.

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:34.850 align:middle line:10%
He named it after
somebody-- called it Karl.

01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:37.700 align:middle line:10%
So it was all of
the same phenomenon.

01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:39.670 align:middle line:10%
It was just totally amazing.

01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:42.440 align:middle line:10%
>> And it created this as
a result of experimentation

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.300 align:middle line:10%
in his living room?

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:46.490 align:middle line:10%
>> In his apartment.

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:47.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:48.760 align:middle line:10%
In his apartment?

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:49.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.360 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.030 align:middle line:10%
So a little while ago, when we
were talking about the windows,

01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:55.460 align:middle line:10%
one of the things that you
said could have been involved--

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:59.510 align:middle line:10%
I mean, could be responsible
for such a reaction was

01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:01.700 align:middle line:10%
longitudinal energy
waves, which you

01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:04.620 align:middle line:10%
said can be created
in a lab setting.

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:05.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:07.250 align:middle line:10%
And he had experienced that too.

01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:09.350 align:middle line:10%
Round holes in windows.

01:04:09.350 --> 01:04:12.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Was he working with
longitudinal energy waves?

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:15.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:18.730 align:middle line:10%
He had created-- he was trying
to replicate the work of Nikola

01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:20.080 align:middle line:10%
Tesla.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:23.560 align:middle line:10%
And he first started out
with a big Tesla coil

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:29.550 align:middle line:10%
and then would interfere in
that static field various radio

01:04:29.550 --> 01:04:32.660 align:middle line:10%
frequency signals.

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:34.243 align:middle line:10%
And then started
getting weird effects

01:04:34.243 --> 01:04:35.452 align:middle line:10%
and thought, oh, this is fun.

01:04:35.452 --> 01:04:38.000 align:middle line:10%
Let's see what happens here
and you get something rises up.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.660 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes something
would fly up.

01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:42.550 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes it would tear apart.

01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:47.390 align:middle line:10%
And I've got videos of some of
these experiments on my website

01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:51.830 align:middle line:10%
where you have a metal file
where it cracks in half

01:04:51.830 --> 01:04:53.720 align:middle line:10%
and then one half
of it slides over

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:56.100 align:middle line:10%
relative to the other half.

01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:58.730 align:middle line:10%
And then there's a
piece of steel rod

01:04:58.730 --> 01:05:01.500 align:middle line:10%
that starts doing sit ups.

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:06.800 align:middle line:10%
Steel rods turns into to jello
and jelly starts doing sit ups

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.980 align:middle line:10%
and then snakes around.

01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:11.438 align:middle line:10%
There's another one that's about
two inches in diameter that

01:05:11.438 --> 01:05:12.980 align:middle line:10%
looks almost like
it has a heartbeat.

01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:14.810 align:middle line:10%
You see the shimmer
on the surface of it.

01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:16.760 align:middle line:10%
It's just very liquidy.

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:20.870 align:middle line:10%
And then after turning off the
gizmo, the signals and so forth

01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:23.960 align:middle line:10%
it, it resolidifies.

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:28.990 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes it goes into
spontaneous combustion.

01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:31.850 align:middle line:10%
Doesn't that sound familiar?

01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:34.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes it does.

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:37.420 align:middle line:10%
You talked about John
Hutchison in here.

01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:38.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Yep.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.502 align:middle line:10%
That's who I was
talking about there.

01:05:40.502 --> 01:05:41.302 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

01:05:41.302 --> 01:05:42.140 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:45.740 align:middle line:10%
>> After I found that
blog-- that was his blog--

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:50.560 align:middle line:10%
I got in touch with him and went
to visit him and saw his stuff.

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:54.410 align:middle line:10%
His various samples
and the equipment

01:05:54.410 --> 01:05:56.160 align:middle line:10%
in action and whatnot.

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.460 align:middle line:10%
And it was just really amazing.

01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:02.328 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, now, so I mean,
obviously, John is brilliant.

01:06:02.328 --> 01:06:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who's followed him
through the years, this

01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:05.930 align:middle line:90%
is a brilliant human being.

01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:08.720 align:middle line:10%
So we know that he
understands these principles,

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.500 align:middle line:10%
and he can apparently
recreate this phenomena

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:17.623 align:middle line:10%
with experiments with energy
directed devices and so forth.

01:06:17.623 --> 01:06:19.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Would never use
it as a weapon.

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:22.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Would never use
it as a weapon.

01:06:22.610 --> 01:06:27.260 align:middle line:10%
With knowledge, how-- let's
just say some other parties

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:30.830 align:middle line:10%
have that knowledge and choose
to use that as a weapon,

01:06:30.830 --> 01:06:35.560 align:middle line:10%
how difficult is it
to use as a weapon?

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:41.200 align:middle line:10%
I mean, does it take some
extraordinary kind of materials

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.580 align:middle line:10%
or something to
do this, or is it

01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:44.140 align:middle line:10%
once you understand
the principles,

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:46.930 align:middle line:10%
is it a relatively
simple thing to do?

01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:48.400 align:middle line:10%
>> I think it's
relatively simple,

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:52.840 align:middle line:10%
but you need to have control of
the various components of it.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:56.630 align:middle line:10%
John doesn't write
anything down.

01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:58.700 align:middle line:10%
He's just enjoying
playing with nature,

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:01.390 align:middle line:10%
seeing what nature can
do and experimenting.

01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:07.900 align:middle line:10%
Not to reproduce it for money or
patents or controlling others.

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:09.300 align:middle line:10%
It's just like,
hey, this is fun.

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:10.870 align:middle line:10%
Let's see what this could do.

01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:12.570 align:middle line:10%
And it moves something around.

01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:15.060 align:middle line:10%
You can imagine how fun it
is to watch a piece of steel

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:15.860 align:middle line:10%
do sit ups?

01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:16.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, yeah.

01:07:16.270 --> 01:07:17.980 align:middle line:10%
I mean, he's been
at it for decades.

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:21.760 align:middle line:90%


01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:27.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Actually, the folks in the
Pentagon went to visit his

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.960 align:middle line:10%
place in 1983.

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:32.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Not surprising
for four months.

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:34.180 align:middle line:10%
>> They want to see
what he was up to.

01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, we can assume
that folks in the military

01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:38.370 align:middle line:10%
and the Pentagon have
access to this technology.

01:07:38.370 --> 01:07:39.170 align:middle line:10%
I think--

01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:40.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, yeah.

01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:41.530 align:middle line:10%
>> They certainly have to--

01:07:41.530 --> 01:07:42.770 align:middle line:10%
that's a given.

01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:43.570 align:middle line:10%
But now--

01:07:43.570 --> 01:07:46.330 align:middle line:10%
>> We have people that in
the turn of the century--

01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:47.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:51.180 align:middle line:10%
>> George Piggott, who
has even a patent on it.

01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:53.080 align:middle line:84%
It shows a picture of
a little drawing of him

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:55.510 align:middle line:84%
with his little
bow tie observing

01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:58.220 align:middle line:90%
those levitating steel balls.

01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And Ed Leedskalnin,
who built Coral Castle.

01:08:03.050 --> 01:08:03.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:07.370 align:middle line:10%
>> And it seems he's got the
same technologies and he only

01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:09.080 align:middle line:10%
had a fourth grade education.

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:10.580 align:middle line:10%
Came over from Latvia.

01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:14.120 align:middle line:10%
Get this wheel that spins
around with magnets on it

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:17.630 align:middle line:10%
and cranks it up, and it's
an electrical generator.

01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:22.401 align:middle line:10%
And also would move these
15 ton stones around.

01:08:22.401 --> 01:08:24.350 align:middle line:10%
Stones approximately
the size of the ones

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:27.740 align:middle line:10%
used to build the Great Pyramid.

01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:32.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I mean as kind
of a political agenda,

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:37.250 align:middle line:10%
we're really very quick and
happy to hang responsibility

01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:40.620 align:middle line:10%
on certain people, certain
groups, certain individuals.

01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:45.050 align:middle line:10%
But in reality, is it fair to
say that any number of parties

01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:48.658 align:middle line:10%
could have access to this
kind of directed energy?

01:08:48.658 --> 01:08:50.450 align:middle line:10%
No, we have to call it
a weapon, because it

01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:53.420 align:middle line:10%
was used in a violent
manner, as a weapon.

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:56.090 align:middle line:10%
Is this something that
any of the parties

01:08:56.090 --> 01:09:00.710 align:middle line:10%
that have been
accused or who have

01:09:00.710 --> 01:09:03.740 align:middle line:10%
been thought to be
possibly responsible could

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:05.240 align:middle line:10%
have this technology?

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:08.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I try to stay away
from the blaming before you know

01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:09.660 align:middle line:10%
what happened.

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:12.170 align:middle line:10%
So I was not listening to what
others were pointing fingers

01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:12.970 align:middle line:10%
at.

01:09:12.970 --> 01:09:16.760 align:middle line:10%
But one thing is clear
that anyone could do this,

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:20.810 align:middle line:10%
and revenge doesn't keep
it from happening again.

01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:23.870 align:middle line:10%
Revenge-- you hear the
phrase, "an eye for an eye

01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:25.310 align:middle line:10%
leaves the whole world blind."

01:09:25.310 --> 01:09:26.359 align:middle line:10%
I think that's very true.

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:29.120 align:middle line:10%
Revenge is not going to keep
this from happening again.

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:29.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely not.

01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:31.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Knowing about it--

01:09:31.090 --> 01:09:34.229 align:middle line:10%
if everyone knows about
it, that's better.

01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:37.310 align:middle line:10%
>> How could that keep
it from happening again?

01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:39.439 align:middle line:10%
>> If people know
about this technology,

01:09:39.439 --> 01:09:40.700 align:middle line:10%
they can use it for good.

01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:45.800 align:middle line:10%
I think that's why Nikola Tesla
did not want to release this

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.950 align:middle line:10%
because he could provide
free energy to the world,

01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:52.100 align:middle line:10%
but he was afraid it would
be used for evil purposes.

01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:53.810 align:middle line:10%
Well, already been
there, done that.

01:09:53.810 --> 01:09:55.490 align:middle line:10%
Don't have that risk anymore.

01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:57.050 align:middle line:10%
Let's use it for good.

01:09:57.050 --> 01:10:00.950 align:middle line:10%
Another aspect of this is,
it's free energy technology.

01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:01.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:04.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Right now, if somebody
develops free energy technology

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:07.170 align:middle line:10%
in their basement
all by themselves,

01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:11.210 align:middle line:10%
they usually end up getting
suicided or car wreck something

01:10:11.210 --> 01:10:12.500 align:middle line:10%
happens to them.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.660 align:middle line:10%
One by one, people
can't develop it.

01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:17.180 align:middle line:10%
But if everyone
knows about this,

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:19.520 align:middle line:10%
everyone witnessed
what happened that day.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.530 align:middle line:10%
You look at the cover
of my book and there's

01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:23.630 align:middle line:10%
no denying what happened.

01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:24.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Free energy
technology does exist.

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:30.500 align:middle line:10%
If that is known
wide enough, everyone

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:33.200 align:middle line:10%
can develop it out in the open.

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:38.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Is that really part of your
impetus for having gone to this

01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:39.680 align:middle line:10%
much trouble to write this book?

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:41.845 align:middle line:10%
I mean other than the
fact you wanted answers.

01:10:41.845 --> 01:10:43.970 align:middle line:10%
From the first minute, you
knew something was wrong

01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:47.480 align:middle line:10%
when you saw this on the
news on September 11th.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:50.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Also, whatever did
this can be used for good.

01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:53.605 align:middle line:10%
That was the motivating
thing behind it is--

01:10:53.605 --> 01:10:55.910 align:middle line:10%
and if we stick our
head in the sand,

01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:58.640 align:middle line:10%
that's giving permission for
whoever did the bad thing

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:01.460 align:middle line:10%
about it to do it again.

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:04.490 align:middle line:10%
Another aspect that came
to mind along the way

01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:09.860 align:middle line:10%
was, it's also quite patriotic
to be doing what I'm doing.

01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:10.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:13.265 align:middle line:10%
>> Because I'm
defending our country.

01:11:13.265 --> 01:11:15.860 align:middle line:10%


01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:18.080 align:middle line:10%
Entertain this scenario--
if you're one of four

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:22.192 align:middle line:10%
or five people who wanted to
take over the United States,

01:11:22.192 --> 01:11:23.650 align:middle line:10%
you don't just go
in the front door

01:11:23.650 --> 01:11:26.680 align:middle line:10%
because the US military
would come get you.

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:29.860 align:middle line:10%
When you do, you have
access to a gizmo like this,

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:33.910 align:middle line:10%
you turn the towers
to dust and then you

01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:35.770 align:middle line:10%
start a truth movement.

01:11:35.770 --> 01:11:37.380 align:middle line:10%
Just play along
with the scenario.

01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:39.910 align:middle line:10%
And you turn these
well-meaning individuals,

01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:41.890 align:middle line:10%
you turn them against
their own government,

01:11:41.890 --> 01:11:44.500 align:middle line:10%
have them destroy their
country from within.

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:48.022 align:middle line:10%
Have them hate their
governments so badly that when--

01:11:48.022 --> 01:11:49.980 align:middle line:10%
they want any government
but the one they have.

01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:54.650 align:middle line:10%
So you walk in and they
welcome me with open arms.

01:11:54.650 --> 01:11:57.830 align:middle line:10%
And that looks like
what's going on.

01:11:57.830 --> 01:12:00.290 align:middle line:10%
We don't know what
entity, where.

01:12:00.290 --> 01:12:02.840 align:middle line:10%


01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:05.670 align:middle line:10%
Sure, we know who covered it up.

01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:08.350 align:middle line:10%
And if you want to know whose
technology it is, go ask them.

01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:11.750 align:middle line:10%
And that's what I tried to do
with my federal qui tam case.

01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:15.440 align:middle line:10%
But they put a stop
to it, but the judges

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:18.040 align:middle line:10%
respected me enough that
they put in the footnote

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:21.670 align:middle line:10%
they were ignoring the
law to dismiss my case.

01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:24.970 align:middle line:10%
That was respectful, and I
respect them for that too.

01:12:24.970 --> 01:12:26.030 align:middle line:10%
That's integrity.

01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:30.230 align:middle line:10%
It's like everyone has
got a gun to their head

01:12:30.230 --> 01:12:34.622 align:middle line:10%
or is blackmailed
or held hostage.

01:12:34.622 --> 01:12:35.580 align:middle line:10%
>> It would seem-- yes.

01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:37.060 align:middle line:10%
It does seem that way.

01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:38.910 align:middle line:10%
And to get any kind
of clarity on it

01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:41.290 align:middle line:10%
seems virtually impossible.

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:45.770 align:middle line:10%
>> From some entity like that
that is being controlled.

01:12:45.770 --> 01:12:46.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:47.370 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

01:12:47.370 --> 01:12:50.580 align:middle line:10%
>> And I somehow managed to
survive getting my book out.

01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:53.775 align:middle line:10%
Now I'm pretty safe because
doing me in would give

01:12:53.775 --> 01:12:54.900 align:middle line:10%
more attention to the book.

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:57.653 align:middle line:10%


01:12:57.653 --> 01:12:59.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you have a lot of
interested parties with this

01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:00.090 align:middle line:10%
book?

01:13:00.090 --> 01:13:02.910 align:middle line:10%
I mean, people that are maybe
positioned in places that could

01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:04.215 align:middle line:10%
benefit from knowing this?

01:13:04.215 --> 01:13:06.090 align:middle line:10%
I mean, everyone can
benefit from knowing it.

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:09.390 align:middle line:10%
But you know what I'm saying.

01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:12.720 align:middle line:10%
>> I've had various
people contacting me,

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:16.357 align:middle line:10%
and they're not in the truth
movement or anything like that.

01:13:16.357 --> 01:13:17.940 align:middle line:10%
It's people outside
the truth movement

01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:21.300 align:middle line:10%
that respect me greatly.

01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:24.000 align:middle line:10%
It's like they didn't want
to stick their neck out

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.890 align:middle line:10%
and they're glad somebody did.

01:13:26.890 --> 01:13:30.430 align:middle line:10%
And I also felt I was
in the best position

01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:31.940 align:middle line:10%
not having family--

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:32.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:34.990 align:middle line:10%
>> If you have a family,
your decisions are different.

01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:36.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:39.190 align:middle line:10%
>> And so I felt there was
more responsibility on me to do

01:13:39.190 --> 01:13:40.210 align:middle line:10%
this.

01:13:40.210 --> 01:13:42.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Well that's very clear
thinking and also it's very

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:44.350 align:middle line:10%
courageous thinking.

01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:48.820 align:middle line:10%
And we probably-- I
need to just tell people

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:50.630 align:middle line:10%
you've got to get a
copy of this book.

01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:52.840 align:middle line:10%
If you want to see all this
for yourself, there are--

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:55.000 align:middle line:10%
I mean it looks like
almost thousands of images.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.708 align:middle line:10%
I don't know how many
images are in here.

01:13:56.708 --> 01:13:58.450 align:middle line:10%
I didn't count, but a lot.

01:13:58.450 --> 01:14:01.840 align:middle line:10%
And graphs, charts
of every kind.

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:04.060 align:middle line:10%
Like you say, it's staring
you right in the face.

01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:05.740 align:middle line:10%
Anyone that reads
this can never see

01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:09.460 align:middle line:10%
the event of that morning in
the same way again, which does

01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:10.780 align:middle line:10%
bring up the bigger issues.

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:14.110 align:middle line:10%
And I hear a kind of almost
like girlish excitement

01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:17.670 align:middle line:10%
in your voice on one level
that you blasted through this.

01:14:17.670 --> 01:14:21.850 align:middle line:10%
You've got it out there
and you are an optimist.

01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:24.460 align:middle line:10%
This isn't about
taking anyone down.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:27.370 align:middle line:10%
This is about saying,
let's just show the world

01:14:27.370 --> 01:14:28.870 align:middle line:10%
the horrors of what it can do.

01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:31.120 align:middle line:10%
We'll show the world
the good that it can do.

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:34.640 align:middle line:10%
And that's what I really hear in
your voice as you said earlier.

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:35.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Thanks.

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:35.780 align:middle line:10%
Thanks.

01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:37.270 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, that is the intention.

01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:42.520 align:middle line:10%
Revenge doesn't help
anyone except those

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.880 align:middle line:10%
who are trying to control us.

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:50.690 align:middle line:10%
Well, on that note, we won't
go into Hurricane Erin and any

01:14:50.690 --> 01:14:51.940 align:middle line:10%
of the other phenomena around.

01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:53.357 align:middle line:10%
We'd gone through
so much already.

01:14:53.357 --> 01:14:55.870 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure people's
heads are spinning.

01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:57.790 align:middle line:10%
I want to thank you
so much for your time

01:14:57.790 --> 01:15:00.610 align:middle line:10%
and for having taken
the time and the energy

01:15:00.610 --> 01:15:03.040 align:middle line:10%
to have written
this amazing book,

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.460 align:middle line:10%
"Where Did the Towers Go?"

01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:07.190 align:middle line:10%
So, on that note, Judy,
thank you so much.

01:15:07.190 --> 01:15:09.860 align:middle line:10%
I wish you the very best in
getting the word out there.

01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:14.830 align:middle line:10%
And also, I wish us
all the good fortune

01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:19.510 align:middle line:10%
that this energy source will be
revealed for the good of all.

01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:22.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Keep in mind--
truth is unifying.

01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:23.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes it is.

01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:24.220 align:middle line:10%
It is indeed.

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:25.610 align:middle line:10%
Judy, thank you so much.

01:15:25.610 --> 01:15:26.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Thanks.

01:15:26.410 --> 01:15:27.618 align:middle line:90%
Thanks so much for having me.

01:15:27.618 --> 01:15:29.750 align:middle line:90%

We all need a reality check on
