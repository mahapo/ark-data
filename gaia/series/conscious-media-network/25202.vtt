(gentle music)

2
00:00:20.331 --> 00:00:22.791
<v ->Some of us watch old movies to be taken back to a time</v>

3
00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:24.671
when life was more gentle and simple

4
00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:26.413
and people were more direct.

5
00:00:26.413 --> 00:00:28.891
Others of us know people who, just sitting with them,

6
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:31.491
bring grace into our lives.

7
00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:33.531
Adele Seronde is one such woman.

8
00:00:33.531 --> 00:00:35.851
Raised by a well-educated and artistic family

9
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:37.871
who had a passion for gardening,

10
00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.851
Adele has spent her life dedicated to assisting humanity

11
00:00:40.851 --> 00:00:42.811
to keep our connection with the earth,

12
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:44.251
beginning with childhood.

13
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:46.291
She has always been an original thinker

14
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:49.251
who insists that once we lose our connection with nature,

15
00:00:49.251 --> 00:00:51.491
we lose our connection with self.

16
00:00:51.491 --> 00:00:53.531
She keeps her connection through poetry,

17
00:00:53.531 --> 00:00:54.771
art, and gardening.

18
00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:57.071
Nearing 90 years of age, I was lucky enough

19
00:00:57.071 --> 00:00:59.711
to spend time with her in Sedona recently,

20
00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:02.011
where she has been a community and environmental activist

21
00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:05.371
for many years.

22
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:08.451
Adele, you've written an absolutely beautiful book

23
00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:11.471
based on the own richness of your experience

24
00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:14.611
and your life, and whether you're talking about it

25
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:17.491
literally or metaphorically, you're talking about

26
00:01:17.491 --> 00:01:20.531
each and every one of our own sacred gardens

27
00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:22.131
<v ->That's true.</v>

28
00:01:22.131 --> 00:01:23.131
<v ->which we must be responsible for participating in</v>

29
00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:26.251
and appreciating and creating ourselves.

30
00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:29.131
Can we go back in your life?

31
00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:30.131
<v ->Certainly</v>

32
00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:34.111
<v ->When you were young, your life was like some of the books</v>

33
00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:37.891
and biographies and autobiographies I've read about,

34
00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:41.471
this kind of elegance that existed in the 20's.

35
00:01:41.471 --> 00:01:42.971
<v ->Another time.</v>

36
00:01:42.971 --> 00:01:46.231
<v ->Another time, born into a family where your father</v>

37
00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:49.711
had a really wonderful path in life.

38
00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:54.711
You were born with artistry and gardens and all of this.

39
00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:56.271
<v ->I was very lucky.</v>

40
00:01:56.271 --> 00:01:59.271
<v ->You were, there was a grace and elegance to that time</v>

41
00:01:59.271 --> 00:02:00.212
<v ->Yes.</v>

42
00:02:00.212 --> 00:02:01.212
<v ->that disappeared.</v>

43
00:02:01.212 --> 00:02:02.871
<v ->No, it's true.</v>

44
00:02:02.871 --> 00:02:07.291
And people on my father's side were all artists

45
00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:09.711
for seven generations up and down

46
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:12.671
because my grandchildren are now too,

47
00:02:12.671 --> 00:02:14.491
and I'm right in the middle.

48
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:17.651
But it's something that we inherited,

49
00:02:17.651 --> 00:02:21.831
not only the doing of, but I think the loving,

50
00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:26.411
the joy that comes out of painting or weaving

51
00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:28.231
or any of the arts.

52
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:29.291
<v ->And your art is so beautiful.</v>

53
00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:33.471
There's an innocence and freshness to your art.

54
00:02:33.471 --> 00:02:33.991
<v ->Thank you.</v>

55
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:36.811
<v ->And that's well demonstrated in the book.</v>

56
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:39.171
You have a lot of photographs of beautiful gardens,

57
00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:41.411
but also your own artwork and representations,

58
00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:43.731
which have a lot of spirit behind them.

59
00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:45.771
And let's talk about that, you,

60
00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:49.531
I mean if, we have different paths we can take

61
00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:51.151
and I want to go into the garden part,

62
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:53.931
but just to touch on it.

63
00:02:53.931 --> 00:02:58.571
In the education process now, even when I was a child,

64
00:02:58.571 --> 00:03:01.631
everyone had a chance to do art.

65
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:02.431
<v ->Yes exactly.</v>

66
00:03:02.431 --> 00:03:03.431
<v ->You had your art classes,</v>

67
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:06.631
your music classes, even dance classes, gone.

68
00:03:06.631 --> 00:03:09.771
All been cut out of the curriculum in favor of

69
00:03:09.771 --> 00:03:13.951
really, just kind of the most bare bones curriculum

70
00:03:13.951 --> 00:03:15.971
to create worker bees.

71
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:19.751
<v ->What I've, in one of the interviews that we made</v>

72
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:22.391
for our new book, The Uneducation,

73
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:26.891
with the local principal of one of the schools,

74
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:29.831
she's as horrified as you that they're all gone

75
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:34.611
but what she's done is with the money that comes in,

76
00:03:34.611 --> 00:03:39.591
the $200 from parents, that's tax-free money,

77
00:03:39.591 --> 00:03:42.551
she's able to save up enough so that for one weekend,

78
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:45.491
sometimes two, in the year,

79
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:48.791
she'll have an intensive art festival,

80
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:51.511
and then she's able to pay those teachers

81
00:03:51.511 --> 00:03:53.951
because there's no money in the regular salary,

82
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:57.691
and to have just that, the arts.

83
00:03:57.691 --> 00:04:00.831
They use a theme and they'll do murals.

84
00:04:00.831 --> 00:04:05.491
They'll do dance, poetry, everything, and at least

85
00:04:05.491 --> 00:04:09.011
it gives a sense of the intensity and beauty of art.

86
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:09.811
<v ->Yes.</v>

87
00:04:09.811 --> 00:04:12.011
<v ->She's been able to compensate in that way</v>

88
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:13.271
which I think is brilliant.

89
00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:15.751
<v ->When we're talking about a flow</v>

90
00:04:15.751 --> 00:04:18.131
between the right and left hemispheres of the brain

91
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:21.631
that has been eliminated with the elimination of art.

92
00:04:21.631 --> 00:04:24.771
<v ->And a lifeline for many children.</v>

93
00:04:24.771 --> 00:04:28.611
<v ->A lifeline, absolutely, and so okay, why don't we do this.</v>

94
00:04:28.611 --> 00:04:31.671
Let's start with this book and start talking about

95
00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:34.911
some of your experience and why you wrote this,

96
00:04:34.911 --> 00:04:36.931
and then we're going to flow into your new book

97
00:04:36.931 --> 00:04:39.471
on education because they're equally important subjects.

98
00:04:39.471 --> 00:04:44.331
You received some great inspiration in Glastenbury

99
00:04:44.331 --> 00:04:48.171
at the Challots Well, and I have been there,

100
00:04:48.171 --> 00:04:50.891
and I had a remarkable experience there as well.

101
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:51.451
<v ->Did you?</v>

102
00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:52.451
<v ->Yes, I did.</v>

103
00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:53.371
I took the time

104
00:04:53.371 --> 00:04:54.371
<v ->Can I ask you about yours?</v>

105
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:55.991
<v ->Oh well, I started, I sat down to meditate,</v>

106
00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:59.751
and I was just tuning in to the environment around me,

107
00:04:59.751 --> 00:05:03.191
and I said, "Just show me what it is I need to see."

108
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:06.131
And it was rather profound and austere at the same time,

109
00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:08.491
but it was a series of geometry.

110
00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:09.891
<v ->Oh that's interesting.</v>

111
00:05:09.891 --> 00:05:10.891
<v ->And the intersecting point</v>

112
00:05:10.891 --> 00:05:12.851
of geometry and information coming through.

113
00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:14.531
<v ->Sacred geometry.</v>

114
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:15.531
<v ->Yes, which I wrote down</v>

115
00:05:15.531 --> 00:05:17.851
and I drew out the lines and intersecting points

116
00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:21.191
at the time, and it was quite powerful and unexpected.

117
00:05:21.191 --> 00:05:23.571
That was mine, but let's talk about yours

118
00:05:23.571 --> 00:05:25.031
and what inspired this.

119
00:05:25.031 --> 00:05:29.751
<v ->Well it's interesting because I've been on a,</v>

120
00:05:29.751 --> 00:05:32.211
with a group, a metaphysical group

121
00:05:32.211 --> 00:05:34.931
that was looking at sacred sites,

122
00:05:34.931 --> 00:05:37.111
and we'd come here and we were given the day,

123
00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:38.551
which I was very glad so I could

124
00:05:38.551 --> 00:05:40.951
mosie through the whole garden.

125
00:05:40.951 --> 00:05:44.532
And when I got up to the part where the well is,

126
00:05:44.532 --> 00:05:47.631
and you know that beautiful well cover?

127
00:05:47.631 --> 00:05:48.091
<v ->Yes.</v>

128
00:05:48.091 --> 00:05:52.251
<v ->With the basical Pisces ornament on it.</v>

129
00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:57.251
I just sat down and I began to cry and cry,

130
00:05:58.391 --> 00:06:03.391
and it was as if the whole earth was crying,

131
00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:09.331
and I was basically felt as if

132
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:15.551
the Earth was somehow identified with

133
00:06:15.911 --> 00:06:20.911
the death of Christ in the garden.

134
00:06:21.071 --> 00:06:25.171
And I must have been there a half an hour

135
00:06:25.171 --> 00:06:26.951
not even mindful.

136
00:06:26.951 --> 00:06:29.411
And then there was a clearing

137
00:06:29.411 --> 00:06:33.991
and as a wonderful Navajo song

138
00:06:33.991 --> 00:06:38.871
it says in sadness and beauty I wandered.

139
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:42.051
Something, I don't remember the whole of it,

140
00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:44.551
but I felt somehow cleansed,

141
00:06:44.551 --> 00:06:46.871
and I also felt right then and there

142
00:06:46.871 --> 00:06:51.871
gardens are needed for people, needed as a means

143
00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:56.911
of not only the ideas that can be nurtured there,

144
00:06:57.171 --> 00:06:59.831
so you have gardens of the mind,

145
00:06:59.831 --> 00:07:04.671
but the physical activity, the embracing

146
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:09.671
of all the plants, the insects of nature essentially.

147
00:07:10.391 --> 00:07:14.231
And I said, "This is available to everybody."

148
00:07:14.231 --> 00:07:16.411
The whole world can do this.

149
00:07:16.411 --> 00:07:18.231
It's not something that blows

150
00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:22.271
to the rich or the poor, can eventually come.

151
00:07:22.271 --> 00:07:26.251
And I've been born out on that everywhere

152
00:07:26.251 --> 00:07:28.451
I've talked with people,

153
00:07:28.451 --> 00:07:31.291
people who are as poor as I can imagine,

154
00:07:31.291 --> 00:07:33.071
are happy in their gardens.

155
00:07:33.071 --> 00:07:35.211
And I think this is true all over the world.

156
00:07:35.211 --> 00:07:38.791
People, you know, we think money

157
00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:40.811
is at the base of everything here,

158
00:07:40.811 --> 00:07:44.331
which is crazy because your happiness comes

159
00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:47.491
from totally different sides that

160
00:07:47.491 --> 00:07:49.431
has to do with education, too.

161
00:07:49.431 --> 00:07:52.391
<v ->And we as beings, when we're little</v>

162
00:07:52.391 --> 00:07:56.331
and given free reign, we want to be outdoors.,

163
00:07:56.331 --> 00:07:57.571
<v ->Yes.</v>

164
00:07:57.571 --> 00:07:58.691
<v ->We want to roll in the grass..</v>

165
00:07:58.691 --> 00:07:59.471
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

166
00:07:59.471 --> 00:08:00.851
<v ->We want to pull flowers and smell everything,</v>

167
00:08:00.851 --> 00:08:05.551
touch everything, and then as we become

168
00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:08.871
conditioned, and as we get older, we move indoors

169
00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:11.231
and then most people live the rest of their lives

170
00:08:11.231 --> 00:08:13.711
indoors, and it's those rare moments

171
00:08:13.711 --> 00:08:15.851
where we dream about saving enough money

172
00:08:15.851 --> 00:08:18.291
for a vacation so we can go watch a sunset.

173
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:20.491
<v ->Or go to the ocean.</v>

174
00:08:20.491 --> 00:08:22.891
<v ->Right, or go to the ocean, when in reality</v>

175
00:08:22.891 --> 00:08:25.851
none of it's that far out of our grasp.

176
00:08:25.851 --> 00:08:28.852
<v ->No, and I think that in many instances</v>

177
00:08:28.852 --> 00:08:32.071
gardens have been very integral to the growing

178
00:08:32.071 --> 00:08:35.911
and in this city too, and in this country,

179
00:08:35.911 --> 00:08:37.891
that was true with the big parks,

180
00:08:37.891 --> 00:08:41.211
thank God, for instance, for Central Park.

181
00:08:41.211 --> 00:08:42.211
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

182
00:08:42.211 --> 00:08:45.631
<v ->But in terms of every person having</v>

183
00:08:45.631 --> 00:08:50.131
a little backyard, that does not happen here.

184
00:08:50.131 --> 00:08:52.371
Excepting with the Italian populations.

185
00:08:52.371 --> 00:08:57.371
I come from Boston, and it used to amuse me

186
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:01.251
to see that in the north end, where most

187
00:09:01.251 --> 00:09:04.171
of the Italians are, squashed, because

188
00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:05.611
there are no parks.

189
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:09.191
Every single fire escape is covered with..

190
00:09:09.191 --> 00:09:10.271
<v ->Yes, I've been there, yes.</v>

191
00:09:10.271 --> 00:09:11.451
<v ->So you know.</v>

192
00:09:11.451 --> 00:09:14.871
<v ->Yeah, and basil, even tomatoes.</v>

193
00:09:14.871 --> 00:09:18.411
<v ->You can smell and feel, and this</v>

194
00:09:18.411 --> 00:09:20.511
was part of everybody's life.

195
00:09:20.511 --> 00:09:24.811
<v ->Yes, and we're looking at this from a real</v>

196
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:27.051
psycho-spiritual level..

197
00:09:27.051 --> 00:09:27.631
<v ->Yes.</v>

198
00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:30.551
<v ->We can see evidence of what's happened to us.</v>

199
00:09:30.551 --> 00:09:31.231
<v ->Yes.</v>

200
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:33.451
<v ->By disconnecting from the beauty</v>

201
00:09:33.451 --> 00:09:35.951
of the very earth we've chosen to incarnate onto.

202
00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:40.951
<v ->And those are right to education, because to me</v>

203
00:09:41.531 --> 00:09:46.071
the most important part of the renovation of education

204
00:09:46.071 --> 00:09:49.291
is to recognize that nature and the spiritual

205
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:54.291
values of the world are right there for all of us.

206
00:09:56.391 --> 00:09:58.691
And this should be primary,

207
00:09:58.691 --> 00:10:01.091
this should be consideration.

208
00:10:01.091 --> 00:10:03.831
I talked to another teacher here, and she said,

209
00:10:03.831 --> 00:10:05.891
I asked her what do you think is the most

210
00:10:05.891 --> 00:10:08.831
important thing to save in education?

211
00:10:08.831 --> 00:10:11.371
And she said ethics, ethics don't exist

212
00:10:11.371 --> 00:10:14.571
in many places and this is what's the breakdown

213
00:10:14.571 --> 00:10:17.571
of society at every level, and you see it

214
00:10:17.571 --> 00:10:22.431
in our political situation in the same way.

215
00:10:22.431 --> 00:10:27.431
So if we are to renovate education,

216
00:10:27.551 --> 00:10:30.053
it's got to start right there, and I would say

217
00:10:30.053 --> 00:10:33.531
that nature was part of that, the love of nature.

218
00:10:33.531 --> 00:10:36.171
<v ->And you grew up with gardens, I mean this was</v>

219
00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:38.791
a big part of your life to touch the soil,

220
00:10:38.791 --> 00:10:41.371
and you even talk about, it's not just

221
00:10:41.371 --> 00:10:43.451
seeing the beauty, and the planting, and..

222
00:10:43.451 --> 00:10:44.811
<v ->No, it's the doing.</v>

223
00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:48.311
<v ->The humus, but it's also weeding.</v>

224
00:10:48.311 --> 00:10:50.951
<v ->Sure, it's the work.</v>

225
00:10:50.951 --> 00:10:51.331
<v ->It's the work.</v>

226
00:10:51.331 --> 00:10:55.111
<v ->What I saw in Boston, and this was 40 years ago,</v>

227
00:10:55.111 --> 00:10:59.251
they had the old insane asylums,

228
00:10:59.251 --> 00:11:01.711
and those people were all pushed out

229
00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:05.391
onto the street, and the lands were left,

230
00:11:05.391 --> 00:11:10.031
and those people began to do community gardens

231
00:11:10.031 --> 00:11:11.331
all through those.

232
00:11:11.331 --> 00:11:16.331
And Boston was the possibility of gardening,

233
00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:22.711
was made legal by a wonderful, black legislator

234
00:11:23.491 --> 00:11:28.131
named Mel King, and he got the whole legislature

235
00:11:28.131 --> 00:11:33.131
to recognize that these lands were just dump lots.

236
00:11:34.811 --> 00:11:37.711
Could be used for gardens for the indigent,

237
00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:42.151
the handicapped, for the people who were left,

238
00:11:42.151 --> 00:11:45.051
and what he did was very important.

239
00:11:45.051 --> 00:11:50.051
He made the state responsible for them or the city,

240
00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:56.011
but they were protected.

241
00:11:56.011 --> 00:11:57.951
Because what's happened in many cities

242
00:11:57.951 --> 00:12:01.311
as the older people, or the leftovers,

243
00:12:01.311 --> 00:12:03.231
have moved in and made gardens.

244
00:12:03.231 --> 00:12:05.591
Then they developers look and say, hmm,

245
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:08.551
look what's happened to that land, just for me.

246
00:12:08.551 --> 00:12:09.531
<v ->Yeah, yeah, exactly.</v>

247
00:12:09.531 --> 00:12:14.531
<v ->And so it's important wherever gardens are now</v>

248
00:12:16.011 --> 00:12:17.951
is to think of the protection,

249
00:12:17.951 --> 00:12:21.251
how they can be protected for people.

250
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:24.371
<v ->Absolutely, and I don't know if a series of books</v>

251
00:12:24.371 --> 00:12:27.851
called the 'Anastasia Ringing Cedar' series of books

252
00:12:27.851 --> 00:12:30.471
have come into your awareness, but it's a very

253
00:12:30.471 --> 00:12:33.351
interesting series of books out of Russia.

254
00:12:33.351 --> 00:12:35.811
But one of the things they talk about in this

255
00:12:35.811 --> 00:12:40.391
potentially idealized scenario is in prisons

256
00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:44.631
allowing prisoners to take, in this case

257
00:12:44.631 --> 00:12:45.911
this was Siberia..

258
00:12:45.911 --> 00:12:46.691
<v ->Yes</v>

259
00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:48.751
<v ->Creating a different kind of prison system</v>

260
00:12:48.751 --> 00:12:50.551
where each of the prisoners was given

261
00:12:50.551 --> 00:12:52.131
a little plot of land..

262
00:12:52.131 --> 00:12:53.931
<v ->Oh I see, that's wonderful.</v>

263
00:12:53.931 --> 00:12:57.311
<v ->To create their own sense of beauty,</v>

264
00:12:57.311 --> 00:12:58.691
creativity..

265
00:12:58.691 --> 00:12:59.371
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>

266
00:12:59.371 --> 00:13:01.191
<v ->and then they carried this forward</v>

267
00:13:01.191 --> 00:13:03.891
that as this matured, then they're growing

268
00:13:03.891 --> 00:13:07.691
vegetables, and fruits, and then these

269
00:13:07.691 --> 00:13:09.891
fruits and vegetables, besides being used

270
00:13:09.891 --> 00:13:11.811
within the prison to feed healthy food

271
00:13:11.811 --> 00:13:14.211
to the individuals, would then be exported

272
00:13:14.211 --> 00:13:16.271
and paid for by the public.

273
00:13:16.271 --> 00:13:17.291
<v ->Yes, that's wonderful.</v>

274
00:13:17.291 --> 00:13:18.671
You know I've never read that group,

275
00:13:18.671 --> 00:13:20.131
but really, will you write that down?

276
00:13:20.131 --> 00:13:23.751
<v ->I will, it's a very interesting series of books.l</v>

277
00:13:23.751 --> 00:13:25.391
<v ->Oh, yes.</v>

278
00:13:25.391 --> 00:13:27.611
<v ->But that part, many things about gardening</v>

279
00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:29.751
in there, but that really stuck with me

280
00:13:29.751 --> 00:13:32.531
about how humane, and you're talking

281
00:13:32.531 --> 00:13:34.911
about a reformation of the spirit.

282
00:13:34.911 --> 00:13:37.691
<v ->Yes, I can tell you the story that's central</v>

283
00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:42.691
to my book is Lily Aye, a Chinese innovator and visionary

284
00:13:44.431 --> 00:13:48.591
who, she was a professor of art in Philidelphia

285
00:13:48.591 --> 00:13:53.531
but she wanted, not the gallery situation,

286
00:13:53.531 --> 00:13:57.411
but she really wanted to be part of a community.

287
00:13:57.411 --> 00:14:00.951
And she was given, by a dancer friend

288
00:14:00.951 --> 00:14:03.591
an impossible place in the middle

289
00:14:03.591 --> 00:14:08.031
of north Philadelphia, the ghetto,

290
00:14:08.031 --> 00:14:10.871
and she went there and she saw a run-down

291
00:14:10.871 --> 00:14:14.731
place, with graffiti everywhere, and signs

292
00:14:14.731 --> 00:14:18.491
of drugs everywhere, and she came into this

293
00:14:18.491 --> 00:14:23.491
leftover dump lot, and a black man came

294
00:14:26.391 --> 00:14:30.011
up to her and said, why are you here,

295
00:14:30.011 --> 00:14:32.071
what are you going to do?

296
00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:34.451
She said, I want to make a place of beauty.

297
00:14:34.451 --> 00:14:37.491
And he didn't say anything to that.

298
00:14:37.491 --> 00:14:40.311
He could have said you're crazy, go away.

299
00:14:40.311 --> 00:14:42.711
He didn't, he said, I'll get the children.

300
00:14:42.711 --> 00:14:47.631
And that's what gave her life in that place.

301
00:14:47.631 --> 00:14:49.991
And for 15 years she was there and transformed

302
00:14:49.991 --> 00:14:52.492
the people, that entire area..

303
00:14:52.492 --> 00:14:55.191
<v ->Is that where those beautiful mosaics are?</v>

304
00:14:55.191 --> 00:14:55.831
<v ->Exactly</v>

305
00:14:55.831 --> 00:14:56.851
<v ->And it's just gorgeous.</v>

306
00:14:56.851 --> 00:14:59.571
<v ->She was an artist, essentially.</v>

307
00:14:59.571 --> 00:15:02.331
And she used art as the means

308
00:15:02.331 --> 00:15:04.451
of the transformation, and then gardens,

309
00:15:04.451 --> 00:15:08.891
and then working with people, she built a community.

310
00:15:08.891 --> 00:15:11.191
To me, that's the prototype of what could happen

311
00:15:11.191 --> 00:15:13.151
in any city.

312
00:15:13.151 --> 00:15:17.291
In the poor areas, and you know for three years

313
00:15:17.291 --> 00:15:22.291
people wrote about her talents, how she was a

314
00:15:24.731 --> 00:15:27.931
well-known local legend, to the Ford Foundation

315
00:15:27.931 --> 00:15:30.031
for a grant to be able to help.

316
00:15:30.031 --> 00:15:32.271
Three years she was turned down.

317
00:15:32.271 --> 00:15:35.791
And finally, finally she was given a grant

318
00:15:35.791 --> 00:15:37.711
that was big enough so that she could leave

319
00:15:37.711 --> 00:15:42.491
the community and give it its' own backing.

320
00:15:42.491 --> 00:15:45.691
And she'd done enough teaching that the people

321
00:15:45.691 --> 00:15:48.931
knew how to go on and it still exists.

322
00:15:48.931 --> 00:15:53.011
But, I said why do you suppose it took so long?

323
00:15:53.011 --> 00:15:54.791
And she said because nobody believes art

324
00:15:54.791 --> 00:15:56.991
can do anything.

325
00:15:56.991 --> 00:16:00.491
They don't believe art, they don't know that art

326
00:16:00.491 --> 00:16:04.211
is, can be the salvation of the soul.

327
00:16:04.211 --> 00:16:07.631
And it can open up the doors to every part of living.

328
00:16:07.631 --> 00:16:12.631
And, this is why we're doing the book on education,

329
00:16:12.811 --> 00:16:16.031
because when I saw how little people know

330
00:16:16.031 --> 00:16:20.011
about the earth that they're living on, or anything

331
00:16:20.011 --> 00:16:24.011
that's coming from it, or what to do about the arts,

332
00:16:24.011 --> 00:16:25.951
I thought this is where we've got to start, right

333
00:16:25.951 --> 00:16:30.751
at the beginning and it's got be total revolution.

334
00:16:30.751 --> 00:16:31.371
<v ->Yes.</v>

335
00:16:31.371 --> 00:16:33.551
<v ->Bringing the arts back.</v>

336
00:16:33.551 --> 00:16:35.871
And from my point of view, I would bring

337
00:16:35.871 --> 00:16:38.891
the earth as a center of the curriculum.

338
00:16:38.891 --> 00:16:42.672
<v ->On that very note, I just sent my son</v>

339
00:16:42.672 --> 00:16:44.491
to the Waldorf School, and the one in Sacramento,

340
00:16:44.491 --> 00:16:47.431
which has a very large campus.

341
00:16:47.431 --> 00:16:50.771
And having their little fingers in the dirt

342
00:16:50.771 --> 00:16:53.271
was central to the education.

343
00:16:53.271 --> 00:16:55.911
As you well know, and one of the things

344
00:16:55.911 --> 00:17:00.911
that always impressed me is the, kind of the wonder

345
00:17:01.671 --> 00:17:04.511
I would say, that came about through this system where

346
00:17:04.511 --> 00:17:09.291
creativity and nature were put before stuffing data

347
00:17:09.291 --> 00:17:10.871
into the mind.

348
00:17:10.871 --> 00:17:11.451
<v ->Exactly.</v>

349
00:17:11.451 --> 00:17:14.031
<v ->And by the time they were in first grade they</v>

350
00:17:14.031 --> 00:17:16.471
have to plant their crop in the spring,

351
00:17:16.471 --> 00:17:18.931
in the second grade they harvest the wheat,

352
00:17:18.931 --> 00:17:20.691
crush it and make bread..

353
00:17:20.691 --> 00:17:21.771
<v ->They know..</v>

354
00:17:21.771 --> 00:17:22.951
<v ->Yes..</v>

355
00:17:22.951 --> 00:17:24.311
<v ->They know how to live!</v>

356
00:17:24.311 --> 00:17:25.071
<v ->Yes..</v>

357
00:17:25.071 --> 00:17:26.211
<v ->Right at the beginning..</v>

358
00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:28.311
<v ->And they see how the cycles of life,</v>

359
00:17:28.311 --> 00:17:29.391
how food is created even..

360
00:17:29.391 --> 00:17:29.991
<v ->Exactly.</v>

361
00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:32.451
<v ->Let's talk about what happens when</v>

362
00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:35.411
you re-introduce nature and artistry

363
00:17:35.411 --> 00:17:38.111
into the life of a child.

364
00:17:38.111 --> 00:17:40.851
<v ->Well, it's another way of bringing love</v>

365
00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:44.711
into his life and I think some families,

366
00:17:44.711 --> 00:17:47.971
fortunately do have love, a great deal

367
00:17:47.971 --> 00:17:50.111
from their parents, and some don't.

368
00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:54.671
And some children are in need of this,

369
00:17:54.671 --> 00:17:56.991
and what it does is two things.

370
00:17:56.991 --> 00:18:00.411
It brings the love of the actual doing,

371
00:18:00.411 --> 00:18:03.351
of the plants, the curiosity, what are

372
00:18:03.351 --> 00:18:06.551
the insects doing, what birds will come,

373
00:18:06.551 --> 00:18:11.231
about all the different natural things.

374
00:18:11.231 --> 00:18:13.371
And it also, if you're doing it together

375
00:18:13.371 --> 00:18:16.611
with other people, you're working on a project

376
00:18:16.611 --> 00:18:21.071
together, it brings a kind of a love into community.

377
00:18:21.071 --> 00:18:22.971
That to me is one of the most important things

378
00:18:22.971 --> 00:18:25.051
that we need now.

379
00:18:25.051 --> 00:18:27.791
Instead what we have is a breaking down

380
00:18:27.791 --> 00:18:30.571
of all the systems that give that love,

381
00:18:30.571 --> 00:18:34.071
and to a terrible mistrust, people blaming

382
00:18:34.071 --> 00:18:38.191
the teachers, people blaming everybody else.

383
00:18:38.191 --> 00:18:41.071
And for the bad education system.

384
00:18:41.071 --> 00:18:43.371
And it's a combination of all these things.

385
00:18:43.371 --> 00:18:48.371
And they all need to be rethought with love,

386
00:18:48.831 --> 00:18:51.711
going into it from a totally different direction.

387
00:18:51.711 --> 00:18:54.511
And we've time enough to think today

388
00:18:54.511 --> 00:18:56.431
everybody's under such pressure,

389
00:18:56.431 --> 00:18:57.791
push, push, push, push.

390
00:18:57.791 --> 00:19:01.971
Children are pushed like so many pills

391
00:19:01.971 --> 00:19:05.071
in a bottle, and pushed out.

392
00:19:05.071 --> 00:19:05.671
<v ->Yeah.</v>

393
00:19:05.671 --> 00:19:08.211
<v ->Into a way of education which is just as rigid.</v>

394
00:19:08.211 --> 00:19:12.211
There's that, and truthfully, it's a breakdown

395
00:19:12.211 --> 00:19:16.171
of a level of education as it is every other level.

396
00:19:16.171 --> 00:19:20.091
And what we have to do is to say, oh, so this

397
00:19:20.091 --> 00:19:23.291
is the opportunity to rebuild, this is the real time

398
00:19:23.291 --> 00:19:26.791
we need to take that time to rebuild.

399
00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:29.731
And this is it, every level, not only financial,

400
00:19:29.731 --> 00:19:31.431
which is so obvious to everybody,

401
00:19:31.431 --> 00:19:35.731
but at the scientific, the education level,

402
00:19:35.731 --> 00:19:38.331
at the physical level.

403
00:19:38.331 --> 00:19:42.611
You mentioned what the little children could learn,

404
00:19:42.611 --> 00:19:46.471
and how to care of, instead we have a nation

405
00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:49.411
of obesity with the children.

406
00:19:49.411 --> 00:19:52.891
One of the wonderful things that our President's wife

407
00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:56.691
has done is to use that as a major focus

408
00:19:56.691 --> 00:20:01.331
to get people to eat better, to eat properly.

409
00:20:01.331 --> 00:20:04.571
And this is true at every level,

410
00:20:04.571 --> 00:20:09.191
even at the richest level, we depend on so many

411
00:20:09.191 --> 00:20:11.471
fast foods, so much junk.

412
00:20:11.471 --> 00:20:13.111
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

413
00:20:13.111 --> 00:20:16.131
<v ->And that can be changed, and you know,</v>

414
00:20:16.131 --> 00:20:19.191
there are wonderful people, like your Anastasia Croup,

415
00:20:19.191 --> 00:20:23.251
are working all over the country, Adele Davis,

416
00:20:23.251 --> 00:20:25.771
and so on, who are known.

417
00:20:25.771 --> 00:20:29.331
But what it really can do is to give them

418
00:20:29.331 --> 00:20:32.871
the sense of what the earth is, I mean, after all,

419
00:20:32.871 --> 00:20:36.151
everything comes from it, ultimately.

420
00:20:36.151 --> 00:20:41.151
But we're stuck in such a rigid set of ideas

421
00:20:42.031 --> 00:20:45.211
about not only education, but about everything.

422
00:20:45.211 --> 00:20:49.411
And such fear that keeps this rigid, that

423
00:20:49.411 --> 00:20:54.411
basically I keep wondering how does one

424
00:20:56.471 --> 00:21:00.291
reach to this selfishness, how does one reach,

425
00:21:00.291 --> 00:21:03.111
and I realize that, in the end, you may not

426
00:21:03.111 --> 00:21:05.331
change people, but what you have to do is to

427
00:21:05.331 --> 00:21:09.191
believe so strongly what you're doing, yourself

428
00:21:09.191 --> 00:21:14.191
to help, and to try to catalyze it in other people.

429
00:21:14.611 --> 00:21:15.551
<v ->To magnetize it.</v>

430
00:21:15.551 --> 00:21:17.051
<v ->To magnetize it, that's right.</v>

431
00:21:17.051 --> 00:21:20.571
Eventually, it does at some level touch.

432
00:21:20.571 --> 00:21:25.571
<v ->Yes, and, you're looking at an actual shift in values.</v>

433
00:21:25.791 --> 00:21:26.411
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>

434
00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:28.831
<v ->That takes place when you put children,</v>

435
00:21:28.831 --> 00:21:32.291
when you put fingerpaints, in front of them,

436
00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:35.711
or when you put seeds and weeds and bugs,

437
00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:38.191
and furry things in front of them.

438
00:21:38.191 --> 00:21:40.851
Your value system completely changes

439
00:21:40.851 --> 00:21:42.531
rather than sitting in front of the television

440
00:21:42.531 --> 00:21:45.071
and the computer, being this abstract reality.

441
00:21:45.071 --> 00:21:48.831
<v ->Yeah, you know I was thinking one of the questions</v>

442
00:21:48.831 --> 00:21:53.831
that Lane and Kitty made for me, or maybe you did,

443
00:21:54.391 --> 00:21:56.711
was how would you change the ways that

444
00:21:56.711 --> 00:21:58.711
you change education?

445
00:21:58.711 --> 00:22:01.871
And I did a lot of thinking last night.

446
00:22:01.871 --> 00:22:05.091
But basically I've had to do this thinking anyway,

447
00:22:05.091 --> 00:22:08.791
in terms of the next book that we're writing.

448
00:22:08.791 --> 00:22:12.351
But I think I would start right where we've said,

449
00:22:12.351 --> 00:22:15.191
with the spiritual, with the values, the gardens

450
00:22:15.191 --> 00:22:18.731
and the mind, and the sense of nature

451
00:22:18.731 --> 00:22:20.951
and what it can do.

452
00:22:20.951 --> 00:22:24.392
Just going to start right at the beginning.

453
00:22:24.392 --> 00:22:26.771
And then I think I would bring the arts

454
00:22:26.771 --> 00:22:31.771
in immediately in all forms again.

455
00:22:33.171 --> 00:22:35.911
And these are so fundamental to all of life,

456
00:22:35.911 --> 00:22:40.351
all animals and birds have a dance form

457
00:22:40.351 --> 00:22:43.231
of reproducing themselves, you know,

458
00:22:43.231 --> 00:22:47.431
it's an opening to life.

459
00:22:47.431 --> 00:22:51.651
And this should be taught and valued

460
00:22:51.651 --> 00:22:54.611
right at the beginning.

461
00:22:54.611 --> 00:22:59.611
And the curriculum, I think should be

462
00:23:00.071 --> 00:23:04.371
it should be recognized the hardcore,

463
00:23:04.371 --> 00:23:05.871
what we do need to learn,

464
00:23:05.871 --> 00:23:08.651
like the multiplication tables, like spelling,

465
00:23:08.651 --> 00:23:13.091
like learning to read.

466
00:23:13.091 --> 00:23:16.631
But again, the arts should be used as a way

467
00:23:16.631 --> 00:23:21.291
of making these joyful.

468
00:23:21.291 --> 00:23:23.411
And again, it's a matter of the love

469
00:23:23.411 --> 00:23:25.011
that goes into it.

470
00:23:25.011 --> 00:23:26.911
And this is where the whole question of teachers

471
00:23:26.911 --> 00:23:29.431
and the greatest teachers, and the retraining

472
00:23:29.431 --> 00:23:33.671
of teachers is terribly important.

473
00:23:33.671 --> 00:23:36.371
And there is, for instance, in all the reading

474
00:23:36.371 --> 00:23:40.031
I've been doing, the two major readers,

475
00:23:40.031 --> 00:23:42.831
the two major authors I would recommend

476
00:23:42.831 --> 00:23:46.211
to everybody, John Gardner, whose book

477
00:23:46.211 --> 00:23:50.331
on excellence and leadership, and many others.

478
00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:55.231
I think he has died now but his work

479
00:23:55.231 --> 00:23:58.251
will live forever.

480
00:23:58.251 --> 00:23:59.851
And there's a wonderful woman named

481
00:23:59.851 --> 00:24:02.111
Diane Ravitch.

482
00:24:02.111 --> 00:24:03.011
<v ->How do you spell her last name?</v>

483
00:24:03.011 --> 00:24:05.571
<v ->R A V I T C H.</v>

484
00:24:05.571 --> 00:24:06.331
<v ->Okay.</v>

485
00:24:06.331 --> 00:24:09.451
<v ->There are many, many others and many</v>

486
00:24:09.451 --> 00:24:11.651
of them are good, for instance there's a woman

487
00:24:11.651 --> 00:24:16.631
named Wendy Kopf,I think it's K O P F..

488
00:24:16.631 --> 00:24:17.451
<v ->P F, okay.</v>

489
00:24:17.451 --> 00:24:22.351
<v ->who started Teachers for America</v>

490
00:24:22.351 --> 00:24:25.911
and it's an excellent method of teaching

491
00:24:25.911 --> 00:24:30.911
graduate students, a two year training course,

492
00:24:31.191 --> 00:24:34.751
but her goal's very limited.

493
00:24:34.751 --> 00:24:36.671
It's a wonderful goal but it's limited

494
00:24:36.671 --> 00:24:39.831
to essentially getting minority students

495
00:24:39.831 --> 00:24:41.631
to want to go to college, to giving them

496
00:24:41.631 --> 00:24:44.691
the skills to go, and then go.

497
00:24:44.691 --> 00:24:48.131
But it doesn't talk about all the learning

498
00:24:48.131 --> 00:24:50.251
that is needed, all the other subjects

499
00:24:50.251 --> 00:24:55.251
that are needed, or the learning comes in

500
00:24:55.291 --> 00:24:57.551
from all parts of existence.

501
00:24:57.551 --> 00:24:59.891
And you see a great circle,

502
00:24:59.891 --> 00:25:04.891
with the vectoring systems coming

503
00:25:05.571 --> 00:25:08.231
in from many different directions.

504
00:25:08.231 --> 00:25:12.371
Today you can say it's wonderful that these

505
00:25:12.371 --> 00:25:14.331
children go to college, then what's the job

506
00:25:14.331 --> 00:25:16.251
at the end of that?

507
00:25:16.251 --> 00:25:17.931
And often there is no job.

508
00:25:17.931 --> 00:25:18.491
<v ->Right.</v>

509
00:25:18.491 --> 00:25:21.251
<v ->And often, and this is all over the world,</v>

510
00:25:21.251 --> 00:25:24.351
where's the physical jobs, the menial jobs,

511
00:25:24.351 --> 00:25:29.351
done by the servants, or done by the least paid?

512
00:25:29.571 --> 00:25:31.371
Or the least respected.

513
00:25:31.371 --> 00:25:33.111
And they should be the most respected.

514
00:25:33.111 --> 00:25:33.791
<v ->I agree.</v>

515
00:25:33.791 --> 00:25:38.791
<v ->On every single level, rethought that</v>

516
00:25:38.791 --> 00:25:43.791
whole system of living, and recognizeing

517
00:25:44.731 --> 00:25:49.251
that these are the back-ups of life,

518
00:25:49.251 --> 00:25:52.431
they're the, to serve..

519
00:25:52.431 --> 00:25:53.131
<v ->The backbone.</v>

520
00:25:53.131 --> 00:25:54.511
<v ->The backbone, of course.</v>

521
00:25:54.511 --> 00:25:57.711
And this is what we need, too.

522
00:25:57.711 --> 00:26:00.771
We need to make these respectable, and beloved.

523
00:26:00.771 --> 00:26:05.571
It's like that wonderful story of the juggler,

524
00:26:05.571 --> 00:26:07.391
you know, you remember that story?

525
00:26:07.391 --> 00:26:08.011
<v ->No.</v>

526
00:26:08.011 --> 00:26:13.011
<v ->Oh, he comes to amongst others to give his gift</v>

527
00:26:14.931 --> 00:26:19.831
to the church, and throws his balls up and down,

528
00:26:19.831 --> 00:26:22.691
and they all look at him and say, well that's not

529
00:26:22.691 --> 00:26:26.811
a gift that we could use, what can we do with that?

530
00:26:26.811 --> 00:26:30.891
But he said, it's all I have, and then a great ray

531
00:26:30.891 --> 00:26:35.891
comes down through the stained glass,

532
00:26:36.171 --> 00:26:38.671
and lights him up, and they recognize that this

533
00:26:38.671 --> 00:26:40.392
is a gift of God.

534
00:26:40.392 --> 00:26:41.011
<v ->Yes.</v>

535
00:26:41.011 --> 00:26:46.011
<v ->So anything, no matter how menial, can be just that.</v>

536
00:26:46.071 --> 00:26:48.731
<v ->Absolutely, every one of us has these incredible</v>

537
00:26:48.731 --> 00:26:50.271
buried talents..

538
00:26:50.271 --> 00:26:50.951
<v ->Exactly, yes.</v>

539
00:26:50.951 --> 00:26:55.571
<v ->Something that the others will be in wonder over.</v>

540
00:26:55.571 --> 00:27:00.051
And you know it's interesting because the parts

541
00:27:00.051 --> 00:27:01.591
that have been cut out of education,

542
00:27:01.591 --> 00:27:03.611
we've talked about that you're looking at resurrecting

543
00:27:03.611 --> 00:27:05.991
and inspiring the resurrection of, these are all

544
00:27:05.991 --> 00:27:10.991
pure vibrations, and movement, we're talking

545
00:27:11.491 --> 00:27:14.311
about movement, every single one.

546
00:27:14.311 --> 00:27:16.871
Whether it's music, or art, or being in the garden,

547
00:27:16.871 --> 00:27:20.491
sunshine, colors, sound, all of these are the pure

548
00:27:20.491 --> 00:27:23.711
frequencies of life.

549
00:27:23.711 --> 00:27:26.711
No wonder there's such a deadening

550
00:27:26.711 --> 00:27:29.051
of the spirit and heart and mind when you

551
00:27:29.051 --> 00:27:31.511
cut out all the supporting frequencies,

552
00:27:31.511 --> 00:27:32.711
it's left-brain, only.

553
00:27:32.711 --> 00:27:35.231
<v ->In order that you go into a linear direction</v>

554
00:27:35.231 --> 00:27:36.051
this way..

555
00:27:36.051 --> 00:27:36.631
<v ->Yes.</v>

556
00:27:36.631 --> 00:27:38.411
<v ->Instead of in circular, spiral directions,</v>

557
00:27:38.411 --> 00:27:40.351
which include everything.

558
00:27:40.351 --> 00:27:42.811
<v ->Absolutely, and you know one of the things,</v>

559
00:27:42.811 --> 00:27:46.451
I watch Stuart's class, my son is now 29,

560
00:27:46.451 --> 00:27:48.911
and so we're seeing, some of them are now

561
00:27:48.911 --> 00:27:50.751
having children who are now back in the Waldorf

562
00:27:50.751 --> 00:27:53.991
System again, but I've watched that class because

563
00:27:53.991 --> 00:27:55.651
they were very close, and what happened

564
00:27:55.651 --> 00:27:58.331
to them, compared to an ordinary class of 20

565
00:27:58.331 --> 00:27:59.291
or 25, it's a small class.

566
00:27:59.291 --> 00:28:04.291
Almost all of them lived out the genius

567
00:28:05.251 --> 00:28:07.912
that they were starting to show in their own way

568
00:28:07.912 --> 00:28:11.411
at a very early age because they were not shoved

569
00:28:11.411 --> 00:28:14.431
into a little corner and told you're going to, you need

570
00:28:14.431 --> 00:28:16.872
to do this to get a good job, they did what they

571
00:28:16.872 --> 00:28:19.791
wanted to do, and the expression throughout that class

572
00:28:19.791 --> 00:28:23.311
was everything from Economics and the world

573
00:28:23.311 --> 00:28:27.911
of green corporate life, to an opera singer,

574
00:28:27.911 --> 00:28:31.511
at a high level, to everything in between..

575
00:28:31.511 --> 00:28:34.551
<v ->You see, that's what's missing, it's just that.</v>

576
00:28:34.551 --> 00:28:39.531
Part of the book, I should tell you by way of preface,

577
00:28:39.531 --> 00:28:44.431
is that we're going to interview about 20 to 30 people.

578
00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:48.751
Hopefully for the whole strata of professions.

579
00:28:48.751 --> 00:28:53.751
Basically to say what does education section mean to you?

580
00:28:54.171 --> 00:28:56.111
What's really important to learn?

581
00:28:56.111 --> 00:29:00.791
And I'm excited about this because already

582
00:29:00.791 --> 00:29:03.611
the wonderful things that have begun

583
00:29:03.611 --> 00:29:04.931
to come back.

584
00:29:04.931 --> 00:29:09.091
And one of the teachers that we've interviewed

585
00:29:09.091 --> 00:29:13.431
has the senior class at the local school,

586
00:29:13.431 --> 00:29:16.871
and these are the college-oriented kids.

587
00:29:16.871 --> 00:29:20.791
But, I've been told, and you know,

588
00:29:20.791 --> 00:29:22.891
essentially with the gardens, we know

589
00:29:22.891 --> 00:29:24.651
that the little ones love it, but most of the time

590
00:29:24.651 --> 00:29:27.111
that no connection by seniors that think

591
00:29:27.111 --> 00:29:29.191
what the heck?

592
00:29:29.191 --> 00:29:29.611
<v ->Yeah.</v>

593
00:29:29.611 --> 00:29:33.631
<v ->And anyway she started with a garden</v>

594
00:29:33.631 --> 00:29:37.611
with them in the junior high, and they've

595
00:29:37.611 --> 00:29:39.851
had to build it, they've had to build the fence..

596
00:29:39.851 --> 00:29:41.051
<v ->Good.</v>

597
00:29:41.051 --> 00:29:42.491
<v ->They've had to do every single bit of the work.</v>

598
00:29:42.491 --> 00:29:45.231
They've all become entranced with gardens.

599
00:29:45.231 --> 00:29:46.371
<v ->Yes, wonderful!</v>

600
00:29:46.371 --> 00:29:50.871
<v ->So, I said, this is that teacher, and we asked her</v>

601
00:29:50.871 --> 00:29:55.871
what is it that makes you want to teach?

602
00:29:56.091 --> 00:29:58.751
And she said the only thing that I ask first,

603
00:29:58.751 --> 00:30:02.631
is that I be happy, and I have to see

604
00:30:02.631 --> 00:30:07.171
that they are happy, too, and I have

605
00:30:07.171 --> 00:30:08.751
to reach them.

606
00:30:08.751 --> 00:30:10.871
<v ->How profound and simple is that?</v>

607
00:30:10.871 --> 00:30:13.171
A teacher that simply wants to be happy teaching,

608
00:30:13.171 --> 00:30:15.411
and have happy students, that part's been

609
00:30:15.411 --> 00:30:17.931
pretty much annihilated in the system

610
00:30:17.931 --> 00:30:20.671
with tests for scores only..

611
00:30:20.671 --> 00:30:21.831
<v ->Well, the testing..</v>

612
00:30:21.831 --> 00:30:23.791
<v ->No Child Left Behind, every child's left behind.</v>

613
00:30:23.791 --> 00:30:25.231
<v ->Oh, I know, exactly.</v>

614
00:30:25.231 --> 00:30:30.231
Anyway, I think that the whole curriculum has to be

615
00:30:33.531 --> 00:30:35.711
imbued with love again.

616
00:30:35.711 --> 00:30:38.451
There's one writer, his name I've forgotten,

617
00:30:38.451 --> 00:30:40.871
but he wrote a book named, 'Focus'

618
00:30:40.871 --> 00:30:45.271
who says you could do two things immediately.

619
00:30:45.271 --> 00:30:48.671
And that's you make literature, great literature

620
00:30:48.671 --> 00:30:52.511
a part of your immediate English studies,

621
00:30:52.511 --> 00:30:56.051
not the watered down pop that you're given..

622
00:30:56.051 --> 00:30:57.191
<v ->Right.</v>

623
00:30:57.191 --> 00:30:59.031
<v ->And you take bits and pieces, and you make them</v>

624
00:30:59.031 --> 00:31:03.071
think, and you use poetry and you really have them

625
00:31:03.071 --> 00:31:08.071
think and write and discuss, and think of that

626
00:31:09.091 --> 00:31:13.171
for an instance as opposed to what apparently

627
00:31:13.171 --> 00:31:16.751
now is happening in Tempe that they all lean

628
00:31:16.751 --> 00:31:19.151
toward online, and..

629
00:31:19.151 --> 00:31:20.051
<v ->They're doing what online?</v>

630
00:31:20.051 --> 00:31:23.333
<v ->All of the school children have been</v>

631
00:31:23.333 --> 00:31:24.931
taught online..

632
00:31:24.931 --> 00:31:25.551
<v ->Online, yes, yes.</v>

633
00:31:25.551 --> 00:31:27.591
<v ->And somebody asked the teacher when do you</v>

634
00:31:27.591 --> 00:31:29.051
see them, when do you get together?

635
00:31:29.051 --> 00:31:30.631
When they graduate..

636
00:31:30.631 --> 00:31:31.891
<v ->And this is in Tempe, Arizona?</v>

637
00:31:31.891 --> 00:31:33.031
<v ->This is Tempe, Arizona.</v>

638
00:31:33.031 --> 00:31:35.151
And I don't know, I haven't been yet

639
00:31:35.151 --> 00:31:37.772
but I heard this, and I thought, dear God.

640
00:31:37.772 --> 00:31:40.631
Everything that's important about

641
00:31:40.631 --> 00:31:43.051
the interrelationship with people

642
00:31:43.051 --> 00:31:44.771
is being left out.

643
00:31:44.771 --> 00:31:46.251
Why are they doing it?

644
00:31:46.251 --> 00:31:48.231
Because one, it saves money.

645
00:31:48.231 --> 00:31:52.271
Less teachers, one good teacher, anyway..

646
00:31:52.271 --> 00:31:54.671
<v ->Well, you can see the beauty of it if you're</v>

647
00:31:54.671 --> 00:31:56.251
in a very remote part of the world,

648
00:31:56.251 --> 00:31:57.831
and you have no chance of education..

649
00:31:57.831 --> 00:31:58.531
<v ->That's a different thing..</v>

650
00:31:58.531 --> 00:32:00.291
<v ->But now when you're in a densely populated</v>

651
00:32:00.291 --> 00:32:02.031
area where you can easily gather.

652
00:32:02.031 --> 00:32:04.731
<v ->No, exactly, and even in the densely populated,</v>

653
00:32:04.731 --> 00:32:08.611
not densely populated, they could get together

654
00:32:08.611 --> 00:32:09.731
for a conference..

655
00:32:09.731 --> 00:32:10.411
<v ->That's true.</v>

656
00:32:10.411 --> 00:32:11.251
<v ->Which people would get together.</v>

657
00:32:11.251 --> 00:32:14.591
Well, anyway, we haven't gotten to interview

658
00:32:14.591 --> 00:32:15.871
that teacher yet.

659
00:32:15.871 --> 00:32:17.551
<v ->Oh, well that will be an interesting one for you.</v>

660
00:32:17.551 --> 00:32:18.831
<v ->I should say so.</v>

661
00:32:18.831 --> 00:32:23.411
But I think he also said the same thing

662
00:32:23.411 --> 00:32:26.111
about mathematics, that they didn't get to the sources

663
00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:30.951
and the joy of numbers instead of just again

664
00:32:30.951 --> 00:32:33.131
cram, cram, cram, cram, cram, cram.

665
00:32:33.131 --> 00:32:33.771
<v ->Yes.</v>

666
00:32:33.771 --> 00:32:36.051
<v ->People are teaching to the tests now.</v>

667
00:32:36.051 --> 00:32:38.771
They're being forced to, teachers are being

668
00:32:38.771 --> 00:32:41.991
forced to cheat in order not to be fired.

669
00:32:41.991 --> 00:32:43.731
That's terrible.

670
00:32:43.731 --> 00:32:45.651
<v ->No, it's in the state of collapse,</v>

671
00:32:45.651 --> 00:32:47.511
the systems in a state of collapse..

672
00:32:47.511 --> 00:32:48.851
<v ->Yes, it is.</v>

673
00:32:48.851 --> 00:32:50.491
<v ->And another thing that's been lost, and</v>

674
00:32:50.491 --> 00:32:55.391
I see this in your generation is there is a type,

675
00:32:55.391 --> 00:32:59.131
even in the entertainment industry, I'm not saying

676
00:32:59.131 --> 00:33:01.031
this literally, but there's this feeling

677
00:33:01.031 --> 00:33:05.391
of a type of innocence, a more innocent time.

678
00:33:05.391 --> 00:33:06.231
<v ->Yeah.</v>

679
00:33:06.231 --> 00:33:07.691
<v ->And you see it in the very, very early films</v>

680
00:33:07.691 --> 00:33:10.291
out of Hollywood, even early television like,

681
00:33:10.291 --> 00:33:13.731
Hey, Beav, why don't we go down to the soda shop,

682
00:33:13.731 --> 00:33:17.571
shall we ask Pop first, you know it's really

683
00:33:17.571 --> 00:33:20.271
a very different kind of reality where,

684
00:33:20.271 --> 00:33:25.271
and yeah, exactly the thing is that as we've become

685
00:33:25.491 --> 00:33:27.711
disconnected from arts, as we become disconnected

686
00:33:27.711 --> 00:33:31.411
from nature, our ethics have just been trashed..

687
00:33:31.411 --> 00:33:33.211
<v ->Disconnected from everything, we're fragmented.</v>

688
00:33:33.211 --> 00:33:36.131
<v ->We're fragmented, there's been an incredible</v>

689
00:33:36.131 --> 00:33:38.691
loss of innocence, it's not to say all generations haven't

690
00:33:38.691 --> 00:33:41.011
created wars and done stupid, selfish things,

691
00:33:41.011 --> 00:33:46.011
but our expressions have changed, and I very much

692
00:33:47.291 --> 00:33:50.551
admire the sweetness of your generation.

693
00:33:50.551 --> 00:33:52.331
<v ->Well I do, too.</v>

694
00:33:52.331 --> 00:33:53.031
<v ->Yeah.</v>

695
00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:56.611
<v ->I was terribly lucky, and no, it's true</v>

696
00:33:56.611 --> 00:34:01.611
although you know, I remember doing something.

697
00:34:02.431 --> 00:34:07.431
I had a wonderful, wonderful teacher, I don't know,

698
00:34:07.491 --> 00:34:09.311
do you know Christopher Lane?

699
00:34:09.311 --> 00:34:10.091
<v ->No.</v>

700
00:34:10.091 --> 00:34:15.091
<v ->He's a local poet and he was the head</v>

701
00:34:16.051 --> 00:34:19.651
and the buffoon, wonderful head of the Slam Poetry Group..

702
00:34:19.651 --> 00:34:20.591
<v ->Okay, yes..</v>

703
00:34:20.591 --> 00:34:22.711
<v ->And I became so entranced with what</v>

704
00:34:22.711 --> 00:34:25.311
they were doing that I asked him if he would

705
00:34:25.311 --> 00:34:28.711
take me as a student, which he did do.

706
00:34:28.711 --> 00:34:32.451
And we tried, I worked with him for two years,

707
00:34:32.451 --> 00:34:34.411
and he was very, very, very helpful..

708
00:34:34.411 --> 00:34:36.511
<v ->The Slam Poetry Movement..</v>

709
00:34:36.511 --> 00:34:39.751
<v ->Yes, and you know, he was a real poet,</v>

710
00:34:39.751 --> 00:34:44.351
love language and he had none of these he didn't know

711
00:34:44.351 --> 00:34:46.771
who Yates was, he didn't know who Dylan Thomas was,

712
00:34:46.771 --> 00:34:49.811
in other words, none of the kind of background

713
00:34:49.811 --> 00:34:54.511
that I had, so we could actually help each other that way.

714
00:34:54.511 --> 00:34:55.231
<v ->Yes.</v>

715
00:34:55.231 --> 00:34:59.971
<v ->But anyway, I find it at a time with him</v>

716
00:34:59.971 --> 00:35:04.971
as a slam poet and I didn't get beyond the first link

717
00:35:06.651 --> 00:35:09.051
but it was very good training for me, made me see

718
00:35:09.051 --> 00:35:14.051
how great those kids are, they memorize everything.

719
00:35:14.511 --> 00:35:18.171
They spend time, they put their whole lives

720
00:35:18.171 --> 00:35:22.291
into those actions, and I was really thrilled by that.

721
00:35:22.291 --> 00:35:26.771
One little boy, little black boy came up, was also

722
00:35:26.771 --> 00:35:31.771
one of the contestants, at the end, the person who won

723
00:35:34.071 --> 00:35:39.071
then said we're going to, all the others are saying,

724
00:35:39.291 --> 00:35:44.291
oh, do that, the second poem, the encore.

725
00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:46.991
Well it had 50 f's in it.

726
00:35:46.991 --> 00:35:47.691
<v ->Yeah.</v>

727
00:35:47.691 --> 00:35:51.191
<v ->50, and I thought how could you not be bored</v>

728
00:35:51.191 --> 00:35:53.671
to death with all of this screechery..

729
00:35:53.671 --> 00:35:55.351
<v ->Certainly there could be some other words</v>

730
00:35:55.351 --> 00:35:56.531
that might replace it.

731
00:35:56.531 --> 00:35:59.191
<v ->Well, exactly, a variety of words.</v>

732
00:35:59.191 --> 00:36:01.811
But in any case, at the end the same little boy

733
00:36:01.811 --> 00:36:05.151
said, oh, yes, yes, go, go, go, more f's,

734
00:36:05.151 --> 00:36:07.871
and he came up to me and he said, you know,

735
00:36:07.871 --> 00:36:11.211
I loved your work, I hope we see you again.

736
00:36:11.211 --> 00:36:12.491
It was so simple..

737
00:36:12.491 --> 00:36:12.991
<v ->Oh,</v>

738
00:36:12.991 --> 00:36:15.511
<v ->And so sweet, I began to cry.</v>

739
00:36:15.511 --> 00:36:20.511
Yes, the child was wanting this silly language

740
00:36:20.911 --> 00:36:23.911
over and over again, it was just a child,

741
00:36:23.911 --> 00:36:26.311
saying, and really loving.

742
00:36:26.311 --> 00:36:27.791
<v ->That is amazing.</v>

743
00:36:27.791 --> 00:36:28.351
<v ->Yeah, I know.</v>

744
00:36:28.351 --> 00:36:29.991
<v ->It goes to show you what's really there..</v>

745
00:36:29.991 --> 00:36:30.711
<v ->What's really there.</v>

746
00:36:30.711 --> 00:36:31.571
<v ->In the heart.</v>

747
00:36:31.571 --> 00:36:33.331
<v ->Exactly, that's what I had, too.</v>

748
00:36:33.331 --> 00:36:34.531
To realize.

749
00:36:34.531 --> 00:36:39.451
<v ->And so, what is the working title of your</v>

750
00:36:39.451 --> 00:36:40.731
new book, by the way?

751
00:36:40.731 --> 00:36:41.711
Do you have one yet?

752
00:36:41.711 --> 00:36:43.091
<v ->We don't have one yet.</v>

753
00:36:43.091 --> 00:36:44.531
<v ->Okay, we're not that far yet.</v>

754
00:36:44.531 --> 00:36:46.211
But people will be able to find you

755
00:36:46.211 --> 00:36:48.071
through the existing book, right?

756
00:36:48.071 --> 00:36:48.891
<v ->We've got to find one.</v>

757
00:36:48.891 --> 00:36:50.851
<v ->'Our Sacred Garden' is the book that's out now,</v>

758
00:36:50.851 --> 00:36:53.371
and we know that you have this work in progress

759
00:36:53.371 --> 00:36:54.631
that's going on..

760
00:36:54.631 --> 00:36:58.191
<v ->I keep wanting 'Pegasus Afar' but maybe</v>

761
00:36:58.191 --> 00:36:59.471
something different.

762
00:36:59.471 --> 00:37:00.811
<v ->Yeah, so we'll see how that goes,</v>

763
00:37:00.811 --> 00:37:04.031
but I would like you to kind of draw this all together

764
00:37:04.031 --> 00:37:08.971
about what it's going to take, looking at all of it,

765
00:37:08.971 --> 00:37:13.371
multidimensionally to bring these little kids

766
00:37:13.371 --> 00:37:16.132
back into their hearts, to create the new world

767
00:37:16.132 --> 00:37:19.111
that we're all getting glimpses of, we all know it's going

768
00:37:19.111 --> 00:37:20.011
to turn around.

769
00:37:20.011 --> 00:37:23.331
How do you see this being facilitated?

770
00:37:23.331 --> 00:37:28.331
<v ->Well, I think it's strange enough, the electronic</v>

771
00:37:28.611 --> 00:37:32.291
system which I don't know much about,

772
00:37:32.291 --> 00:37:34.691
and the very thing that I didn't think should be

773
00:37:34.691 --> 00:37:37.831
in the schools, of electronically talking.

774
00:37:37.831 --> 00:37:41.891
I think that if you picked the major teachers,

775
00:37:41.891 --> 00:37:43.432
from all over the country, and I think

776
00:37:43.432 --> 00:37:46.911
they're pretty well-known, and you

777
00:37:46.911 --> 00:37:50.331
had a conference with them, as to what

778
00:37:50.331 --> 00:37:53.391
would be the best and clearest and quickest way

779
00:37:53.391 --> 00:37:58.391
to train new teachers, and some way of getting

780
00:37:59.231 --> 00:38:03.931
ones who have great experience, with my age,

781
00:38:03.931 --> 00:38:08.191
the older ones that still have had a real education,

782
00:38:08.191 --> 00:38:10.311
if you were able to get them together and use

783
00:38:10.311 --> 00:38:15.311
the electronics plus somehow weekly conferences,

784
00:38:15.571 --> 00:38:17.891
where people could talk to each other,

785
00:38:17.891 --> 00:38:21.611
that you might be able to renovate the teaching,

786
00:38:21.611 --> 00:38:26.391
teacher teaching, you know, I've never had

787
00:38:26.391 --> 00:38:29.751
that training, so I'd think you'd have to get people

788
00:38:29.751 --> 00:38:32.651
who are well-versed and that like Ravitch,

789
00:38:32.651 --> 00:38:35.531
she would be the exact kind of person

790
00:38:35.531 --> 00:38:39.051
that could bring that together.

791
00:38:39.051 --> 00:38:42.431
I would have this going simultaneously

792
00:38:42.431 --> 00:38:47.431
working at the level of the little children,

793
00:38:47.491 --> 00:38:50.711
in the ways that you already described.

794
00:38:50.711 --> 00:38:54.531
With the nature and the arts.

795
00:38:54.531 --> 00:38:59.531
I'd somehow have your teacher training

796
00:39:00.491 --> 00:39:04.151
include the wisdom at the far ends of every

797
00:39:04.151 --> 00:39:06.391
profession, because those should be brought

798
00:39:06.391 --> 00:39:08.771
into our thinking, they should be part of what

799
00:39:08.771 --> 00:39:10.811
should be stimulating.

800
00:39:10.811 --> 00:39:12.851
The teachers would also, the students

801
00:39:12.851 --> 00:39:14.731
at different levels.

802
00:39:14.731 --> 00:39:19.591
Again, I wish I could remember, but I think

803
00:39:19.591 --> 00:39:21.731
it came out of Harvard that there was a way

804
00:39:21.731 --> 00:39:24.991
of cyclically teaching, so that you had

805
00:39:24.991 --> 00:39:27.231
the things that were happening way out

806
00:39:27.231 --> 00:39:31.571
at the far edge, coming in at a very simple level here.

807
00:39:31.571 --> 00:39:34.331
Another level here, and another level here, do you

808
00:39:34.331 --> 00:39:35.351
see what I'm saying?

809
00:39:35.351 --> 00:39:36.011
<v ->Yes.</v>

810
00:39:36.011 --> 00:39:39.911
<v ->By the time you started the children, for instance,</v>

811
00:39:39.911 --> 00:39:42.311
with the environment, by the time you were

812
00:39:42.311 --> 00:39:44.971
in the eighth grade you would have a real sense

813
00:39:44.971 --> 00:39:46.151
of ecology.

814
00:39:46.151 --> 00:39:46.851
<v ->Yes.</v>

815
00:39:46.851 --> 00:39:48.251
<v ->Of the interrelationships.</v>

816
00:39:48.251 --> 00:39:51.251
There is a teacher right now who's done this.

817
00:39:51.251 --> 00:39:56.251
Whose name is Heather Devich, Devich, D E V I C H.

818
00:39:59.251 --> 00:40:00.691
<v ->Okay..</v>

819
00:40:00.691 --> 00:40:03.951
<v ->And she is the environmental coordinator</v>

820
00:40:03.951 --> 00:40:07.231
for the Mission School in Phoenix.

821
00:40:07.231 --> 00:40:07.751
<v ->Okay.</v>

822
00:40:07.751 --> 00:40:12.751
<v ->Which is a notable Montessori school, and basically</v>

823
00:40:12.991 --> 00:40:16.171
she has done a series of lessons all the way through

824
00:40:16.171 --> 00:40:18.431
right up to the ends.

825
00:40:18.431 --> 00:40:19.211
<v ->Wonderful.</v>

826
00:40:19.211 --> 00:40:21.191
So there's some modeling that has been done..

827
00:40:21.191 --> 00:40:22.271
<v ->It's called Global Seed.</v>

828
00:40:22.271 --> 00:40:23.311
<v ->Okay.</v>

829
00:40:23.311 --> 00:40:25.371
<v ->And that's worth people seeing.</v>

830
00:40:25.371 --> 00:40:26.251
<v ->Alright.</v>

831
00:40:26.251 --> 00:40:29.711
<v ->But basically, this could be done each of the</v>

832
00:40:29.711 --> 00:40:34.512
different curricula.

833
00:40:34.512 --> 00:40:36.051
<v ->But interesting that it sounds almost</v>

834
00:40:36.051 --> 00:40:38.251
like you have, the teachers would have to completely

835
00:40:38.251 --> 00:40:42.371
bypass the state mandates in order to pull this off..

836
00:40:42.371 --> 00:40:44.011
<v ->Well, this is the question, there may be some</v>

837
00:40:44.011 --> 00:40:45.611
good things there, just as there are

838
00:40:45.611 --> 00:40:47.531
in the teacher's union.

839
00:40:47.531 --> 00:40:49.851
So that it would take a great diplomat

840
00:40:49.851 --> 00:40:51.531
to bring this together.

841
00:40:51.531 --> 00:40:52.511
<v ->Indeed.</v>

842
00:40:52.511 --> 00:40:54.771
<v ->Because for years, it was a power situation.</v>

843
00:40:54.771 --> 00:40:59.771
No, you can't do it, you can't be ordained, essentially.

844
00:41:00.431 --> 00:41:02.311
You have to do it this way.

845
00:41:02.311 --> 00:41:06.991
But I have met some teachers in teacher's

846
00:41:06.991 --> 00:41:08.751
colleges who are wonderful.

847
00:41:08.751 --> 00:41:12.291
So I think if you could find a few of those,

848
00:41:12.291 --> 00:41:14.491
I don't know how you do this, quite honestly,

849
00:41:14.491 --> 00:41:17.091
and I'm afraid that so many of the people

850
00:41:17.091 --> 00:41:20.311
who would do it are so stuck in their academic

851
00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:25.051
roles, they're not seeing outside.

852
00:41:25.051 --> 00:41:28.051
So you'd have to get a few of the, perhaps,

853
00:41:28.051 --> 00:41:33.051
great, innovative movie stars or other professionals.

854
00:41:35.691 --> 00:41:40.691
<v ->Or a man, your scientist like Gregg Braden.</v>

855
00:41:43.851 --> 00:41:44.571
<v ->Yes.</v>

856
00:41:44.571 --> 00:41:45.451
<v ->He's a wonderful teacher.</v>

857
00:41:45.451 --> 00:41:50.451
People like that that are outside of the box

858
00:41:51.311 --> 00:41:54.231
and could help with this renovation.

859
00:41:54.231 --> 00:41:58.611
Then I would work on all the different

860
00:41:58.611 --> 00:42:01.531
subjects that they got their sources.

861
00:42:01.531 --> 00:42:04.591
If it's history, go and see what

862
00:42:04.591 --> 00:42:07.891
Thomas Jefferson said, what were the things

863
00:42:07.891 --> 00:42:10.991
that led up to it, who were the people who fought

864
00:42:10.991 --> 00:42:11.991
against it.

865
00:42:11.991 --> 00:42:13.271
And a lot of people did.

866
00:42:13.271 --> 00:42:16.491
How did our Constitution exist, what's happening

867
00:42:16.491 --> 00:42:17.891
today with it?

868
00:42:17.891 --> 00:42:21.411
It's being overlooked, or abused..

869
00:42:21.411 --> 00:42:21.971
<v ->Yes, definitely.</v>

870
00:42:21.971 --> 00:42:25.991
<v ->Or whatever, and this could go on..</v>

871
00:42:25.991 --> 00:42:29.531
<v ->Really learn these things from the roots,</v>

872
00:42:29.531 --> 00:42:31.491
and very practical implications of history..

873
00:42:31.491 --> 00:42:33.171
<v ->Practical education, exactly.</v>

874
00:42:33.171 --> 00:42:36.711
And with enough imaginative things that would now

875
00:42:36.711 --> 00:42:39.231
bring in your whole physical outside.

876
00:42:39.231 --> 00:42:44.231
Not just the gardening, but hikes, adventures.

877
00:42:44.511 --> 00:42:47.431
You know those boats, they're learning boats?

878
00:42:47.431 --> 00:42:51.351
Take the kids out, or horseback rides, whatever.

879
00:42:51.351 --> 00:42:56.351
Ways of physically being taught.

880
00:42:56.531 --> 00:43:01.391
In the countries like China, and Russia,

881
00:43:01.391 --> 00:43:03.571
they use physical exercise as a means

882
00:43:03.571 --> 00:43:05.851
of making people harder, and..

883
00:43:05.851 --> 00:43:06.871
<v ->Yes.</v>

884
00:43:06.871 --> 00:43:08.111
<v ->And we need that.</v>

885
00:43:08.111 --> 00:43:10.831
We don't need to have it pounded down us,

886
00:43:10.831 --> 00:43:13.271
but we need to be able to..

887
00:43:13.271 --> 00:43:15.051
<v ->Be flexible, and resilient and in harmony</v>

888
00:43:15.051 --> 00:43:16.411
with nature and sunshine..

889
00:43:16.411 --> 00:43:16.991
<v ->Exactly.</v>

890
00:43:16.991 --> 00:43:18.191
<v ->And everything, yes.</v>

891
00:43:18.191 --> 00:43:21.891
<v ->But there are enough ways of exercise</v>

892
00:43:21.891 --> 00:43:24.911
so that every child could be part of it.

893
00:43:24.911 --> 00:43:27.551
Not just a football team where he has

894
00:43:27.551 --> 00:43:29.151
to sit on the side because he's not a good

895
00:43:29.151 --> 00:43:31.031
enough player, you know.

896
00:43:31.031 --> 00:43:32.671
<v ->Yes, I understand what you're saying.</v>

897
00:43:32.671 --> 00:43:36.391
<v ->My senses that I would balance the electronic</v>

898
00:43:36.391 --> 00:43:39.731
with the physical, with the mental, with the arts

899
00:43:39.731 --> 00:43:43.651
and I'd have all of those as a part of the new curriculum.

900
00:43:43.651 --> 00:43:44.451
<v ->Yes.</v>

901
00:43:44.451 --> 00:43:47.771
<v ->I would also have moving vans, I mean</v>

902
00:43:47.771 --> 00:43:50.691
the school buses could be teaching vehicles

903
00:43:50.691 --> 00:43:53.691
instead of catch-alls.

904
00:43:53.691 --> 00:43:54.391
<v ->Yes.</v>

905
00:43:54.391 --> 00:43:58.311
<v ->There's a wonderful man who used to go</v>

906
00:43:58.311 --> 00:44:01.411
with his little van, he and his wife every

907
00:44:01.411 --> 00:44:05.392
weekend and take five or six kids out to the dessert.

908
00:44:05.392 --> 00:44:09.651
And he had a mobile, now true history.

909
00:44:09.651 --> 00:44:13.913
There'd be ways that people could sit on a lawn,

910
00:44:13.913 --> 00:44:16.711
or in a comfortable living room, ways of moving

911
00:44:16.711 --> 00:44:17.871
<v ->Yes.</v>

912
00:44:17.871 --> 00:44:21.671
<v ->That are unusual ways to stimulate attention.</v>

913
00:44:21.671 --> 00:44:25.411
There are all kinds of things that can happen,

914
00:44:25.411 --> 00:44:27.271
programs right in the middle of the city

915
00:44:27.271 --> 00:44:28.791
in the worst places.

916
00:44:28.791 --> 00:44:31.731
I know, in London, I've heard, I don't know

917
00:44:31.731 --> 00:44:33.971
whether this is true, it's someplace where there's

918
00:44:33.971 --> 00:44:38.311
a whole farm that has been made with horses,

919
00:44:38.311 --> 00:44:41.551
and cows, and out of a few acres.

920
00:44:41.551 --> 00:44:44.111
That would have been a park, obviously,

921
00:44:44.111 --> 00:44:48.531
but it's become a working farm so the kids

922
00:44:48.531 --> 00:44:49.911
could see.

923
00:44:49.911 --> 00:44:53.211
<v ->Yes, yes all of these ideas</v>

924
00:44:53.211 --> 00:44:56.231
make perfect logical sense, we just have

925
00:44:56.231 --> 00:44:59.871
to find our own, we have to find the logic

926
00:44:59.871 --> 00:45:01.131
in ourselves again.

927
00:45:01.131 --> 00:45:03.251
We've allowed other people to dictate to us,

928
00:45:03.251 --> 00:45:05.131
what's going to be rather than demanding

929
00:45:05.131 --> 00:45:08.031
for our children what they actually need.

930
00:45:08.031 --> 00:45:09.991
So this directive is going to come from parents.

931
00:45:09.991 --> 00:45:11.211
<v ->Also, one more thing.</v>

932
00:45:11.211 --> 00:45:15.211
I would get together, teachers with the parents,

933
00:45:15.211 --> 00:45:18.191
because many of the parents feel they're in the same

934
00:45:18.191 --> 00:45:21.131
bad situation as the children that they weren't taught

935
00:45:21.131 --> 00:45:23.871
so they don't know what to do to teach.

936
00:45:23.871 --> 00:45:28.191
And I would get them in on the process renovation.

937
00:45:28.191 --> 00:45:28.911
<v ->Yes.</v>

938
00:45:28.911 --> 00:45:30.791
<v ->What do you really want for these children.</v>

939
00:45:30.791 --> 00:45:33.891
<v ->And you are an example of your own words,</v>

940
00:45:33.891 --> 00:45:35.971
that you speak here today.

941
00:45:35.971 --> 00:45:38.771
You're a painter, you're a gardener, you're a poet,

942
00:45:38.771 --> 00:45:40.431
Slam Poet..

943
00:45:40.431 --> 00:45:41.251
<v ->Activist.</v>

944
00:45:41.251 --> 00:45:45.311
<v ->And activist, and that has to be your passion,</v>

945
00:45:45.311 --> 00:45:47.831
your passion has to be how you're so lively

946
00:45:47.831 --> 00:45:49.851
and I don't want to talk about age because

947
00:45:49.851 --> 00:45:51.632
it's impolite.

948
00:45:51.632 --> 00:45:53.331
<v ->I'm a great-grandmother as of yesterday.</v>

949
00:45:53.331 --> 00:45:55.511
<v ->A great-great grandmother.</v>

950
00:45:55.511 --> 00:45:56.851
<v ->A great-great grandmother in addition.</v>

951
00:45:56.851 --> 00:45:59.231
And so it sounds like it's your own passion

952
00:45:59.231 --> 00:46:01.491
in life that keeps you so young..

953
00:46:01.491 --> 00:46:03.111
<v ->I've been very lucky.</v>

954
00:46:03.111 --> 00:46:05.831
<v ->And connected, alive, bright, shining.</v>

955
00:46:05.831 --> 00:46:07.171
<v ->Thank you.</v>

956
00:46:07.171 --> 00:46:09.091
<v ->I wanted to thank you for your time, Adele.</v>

957
00:46:09.091 --> 00:46:09.751
<v ->Thank you.</v>

958
00:46:09.751 --> 00:46:12.451
<v ->It's been lovely being with you.</v>

959
00:46:12.451 --> 00:46:14.351
To delve further into Adele's work,

960
00:46:14.351 --> 00:46:16.231
you can pick up a copy of her beautiful book

961
