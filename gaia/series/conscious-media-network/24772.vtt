00:00:00.472 --> 00:00:03.363
<v ->It's not easy being raised by a famous father,</v>

2
00:00:03.363 --> 00:00:05.239
especially one that has been a primary

3
00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:07.787
spiritual inspiration for this generation.

4
00:00:07.787 --> 00:00:10.414
But, Don Miguel Ruiz Jr. has learned,

5
00:00:10.414 --> 00:00:12.871
and continues to learn his father's lessons,

6
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:14.998
and is now teaching the Toltec way

7
00:00:14.998 --> 00:00:16.853
with his brother, Don Jose Ruiz,

8
00:00:16.853 --> 00:00:17.995
and his father.

9
00:00:17.995 --> 00:00:19.986
In "The Four Agreements," "Mastery of Love,"

10
00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:21.419
and "Voice of Knowledge,"

11
00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:23.724
Don Miguel Ruiz Sr. shares the practice

12
00:00:23.724 --> 00:00:27.338
of using life as art, as a blank canvas

13
00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:31.221
that is only for you to use for your creation called life.

14
00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:37.465 line:15% 
(soft music)

15
00:00:41.136 --> 00:00:42.695
<v Voiceover>We were talking off camera,</v>

16
00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:44.786
and, you were saying that

17
00:00:44.786 --> 00:00:46.231
it wasn't always easy for you,

18
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:48.249
you rebelled against the Toltec knowledge

19
00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:50.726
when you were younger, as did your father.

20
00:00:50.726 --> 00:00:51.318
<v ->Yes.</v>

21
00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:52.810
<v Voiceover>When his mother was trying to teach him.</v>

22
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:53.513
<v ->Mhmm.</v>

23
00:00:53.513 --> 00:00:54.692
And grandpa.

24
00:00:54.692 --> 00:00:55.856
<v Voiceover>And grandpa.</v>

25
00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:58.473
And so, let's talk about that a little bit,

26
00:00:58.473 --> 00:01:01.098
what was it that you were being taught,

27
00:01:01.098 --> 00:01:04.046
that your being just fought against initially,

28
00:01:04.046 --> 00:01:05.222
like your father?

29
00:01:05.222 --> 00:01:07.166
<v ->Well, the rebellion really came,</v>

30
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.695
more in the sense that,

31
00:01:08.695 --> 00:01:10.528
you know, when

32
00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:13.539
I had to describe to my friends what my family was,

33
00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.741
and it was interesting because, you know,

34
00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:18.296
going to a private school, and mostly Catholic,

35
00:01:18.296 --> 00:01:20.859
it's kind of hard to describe that.

36
00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:23.193
And, you can say the rebellion came,

37
00:01:23.193 --> 00:01:25.261
was like, "Well I want to be part of the world,

38
00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:28.145
"I want to be excepted by my peers."

39
00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:32.597
And, you know, it just mostly was that,

40
00:01:32.597 --> 00:01:35.993
because, growing up with my family,

41
00:01:35.993 --> 00:01:38.254
you know, it was magic all the time,

42
00:01:38.254 --> 00:01:39.960
you know, it was incredible.

43
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.809
But at the same time, we also were raised

44
00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:45.325
by my father as he was going through his own process.

45
00:01:45.325 --> 00:01:47.320
You know, when my father,

46
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.575
had his accident,

47
00:01:49.575 --> 00:01:52.749
the one he writes in his book about,

48
00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:55.906
I was about three years old.

49
00:01:55.906 --> 00:01:57.268
<v Voiceover>Can you tell us about the accident,</v>

50
00:01:57.268 --> 00:01:58.788
for people who haven't read the book?

51
00:01:58.788 --> 00:02:00.518
<v ->My father suffered an accident,</v>

52
00:02:00.518 --> 00:02:01.556
when he was in college,

53
00:02:01.556 --> 00:02:02.793
he was driving back home,

54
00:02:02.793 --> 00:02:04.326
and he had,

55
00:02:04.326 --> 00:02:06.813
one would call it an out-of-body experience,

56
00:02:06.813 --> 00:02:08.269
or something of the sort.

57
00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.539
He remembers, as before he crashed,

58
00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:14.403
he lifted himself out,

59
00:02:14.403 --> 00:02:16.519
he left his body,

60
00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.921
he took his friends out of the car,

61
00:02:20.921 --> 00:02:23.239
and he was still in the car.

62
00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.495
You know, they took him to the hospital,

63
00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:28.217
he was almost dying,

64
00:02:28.217 --> 00:02:30.069
but he remembered the experience,

65
00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.946
he had no idea how to even explain this,

66
00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:37.465
you know, because he was a medical student,

67
00:02:37.465 --> 00:02:39.234
he was a medical doctor.

68
00:02:39.234 --> 00:02:40.885
That kind of belief

69
00:02:40.885 --> 00:02:43.363
doesn't really go well with this.

70
00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:45.076
So,

71
00:02:45.076 --> 00:02:47.115
he began to

72
00:02:47.115 --> 00:02:49.869
doing this

73
00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:51.721
search for himself and that kind of thing,

74
00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:53.245
what's the answer to this, so,

75
00:02:53.245 --> 00:02:55.711
he went to my grandma, you know,

76
00:02:55.711 --> 00:02:58.733
and he told her what had done,

77
00:02:58.733 --> 00:02:59.564
and she says,

78
00:02:59.564 --> 00:03:01.400
"Well you've got to start training with me."

79
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.637
So,

80
00:03:02.637 --> 00:03:04.005
he began to go

81
00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:06.412
to her sessions every Sunday,

82
00:03:06.412 --> 00:03:09.424
and they would go with something they called dreaming.

83
00:03:09.424 --> 00:03:13.974
And, for three years, every Sunday, they go and meditate

84
00:03:13.974 --> 00:03:16.776
from seven or eight o'clock in the morning

85
00:03:16.776 --> 00:03:19.297
to about three o'clock in the afternoon,

86
00:03:19.297 --> 00:03:21.158
every, for three years.

87
00:03:21.158 --> 00:03:23.460
So, when I was a child,

88
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.480
I grew up during that process.

89
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.120
So for me, I remember

90
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.646
a before and after dad of that.

91
00:03:30.646 --> 00:03:33.409
The way he taught me in the before

92
00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.226
he began his transition period,

93
00:03:36.226 --> 00:03:38.306
and then once he came out,

94
00:03:38.306 --> 00:03:41.334
and he was not Don Miguel Ruiz,

95
00:03:41.334 --> 00:03:43.393
you know, (mumbles).

96
00:03:43.393 --> 00:03:45.899
And I was, around my age of

97
00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:47.928
11 or 12 years old.

98
00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:49.890
<v Voiceover>When he completed the process?</v>

99
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:50.971
<v ->Yeah, when he,</v>

100
00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:52.616
when he started to teach

101
00:03:52.616 --> 00:03:54.391
in the way we know him now.

102
00:03:54.391 --> 00:03:55.015
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

103
00:03:55.015 --> 00:03:56.929
<v ->And, I was 11 or 12 years old,</v>

104
00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:58.849
he used to pay me to go to his classes.

105
00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:59.587
(laughs)

106
00:03:59.587 --> 00:04:01.826
You know, wanting me to teach him,

107
00:04:01.826 --> 00:04:04.282
and like, he was wanting me to get involved,

108
00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:06.549
and I was 11 or 12 years old,

109
00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.729
I was really into my school,

110
00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.587
I was really, I was in sixth grade,

111
00:04:11.587 --> 00:04:14.657
and really, going into my teenage years,

112
00:04:14.657 --> 00:04:17.502
so my dad taught me and I really enjoyed it,

113
00:04:17.502 --> 00:04:19.670
and at the same time I wanted to be part of my friends,

114
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.561
and it was this back and forth

115
00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:23.630
between that.

116
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.831
And, I still went,

117
00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:27.516
I still went to the Teotihuacan,

118
00:04:27.516 --> 00:04:28.781
I still did it but,

119
00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:31.108
having learned all these things,

120
00:04:31.108 --> 00:04:33.569
I also learned how to get out of it.

121
00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:36.011
You know, I used my own word,

122
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:39.831
and you know, the way to justify my own,

123
00:04:39.831 --> 00:04:43.963
judge my own victim, my own parasite,

124
00:04:43.963 --> 00:04:46.718
I knew how to get into that,

125
00:04:46.718 --> 00:04:49.045
and say, "I don't need to do this.

126
00:04:49.045 --> 00:04:50.740
"I will just go through the motions."

127
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.591
And, that was fine, but,

128
00:04:54.591 --> 00:04:56.520
even though I still go to the classes,

129
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.517
even though I still went to the weekend reatreats

130
00:04:58.517 --> 00:05:00.378
and workshops my dad held,

131
00:05:00.378 --> 00:05:02.099
even though my dad wound up,

132
00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.063
he would try and teach me

133
00:05:04.063 --> 00:05:05.780
what we call silent knowledge.

134
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.945
Silent knowledge is basically teaching

135
00:05:07.945 --> 00:05:09.586
and, it's like,

136
00:05:09.586 --> 00:05:11.122
if I wanted to learn how to swim,

137
00:05:11.122 --> 00:05:13.028
he'd just push me into the pool,

138
00:05:13.028 --> 00:05:15.820
and if I didn't know, you have to learn.

139
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.453
And that's how I learned how to swim.

140
00:05:19.453 --> 00:05:21.385
That's how

141
00:05:21.385 --> 00:05:23.504
lots of my family

142
00:05:23.504 --> 00:05:25.381
taught us.

143
00:05:25.381 --> 00:05:27.659
Now, my dad gave me a rule,

144
00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.208
and says, "Okay, you can do all you want,

145
00:05:30.208 --> 00:05:32.575
"but when you finish college,

146
00:05:32.575 --> 00:05:35.206
"when you no longer have to function

147
00:05:35.206 --> 00:05:37.385
"the way you have to function in school,

148
00:05:37.385 --> 00:05:39.849
"I will push you very, very hard.

149
00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:42.930
"And until then, you will translate for your grandma,"

150
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.830
who my grandma couldn't speak a word of English.

151
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.178
So she used to, she was a curandera,

152
00:05:48.178 --> 00:05:51.290
a faith healer, and in her healing sessions,

153
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.407
I would translate her prayers,

154
00:05:54.407 --> 00:05:58.378
her interactions with her people who came to see her,

155
00:05:58.378 --> 00:05:59.844
and I did that for,

156
00:05:59.844 --> 00:06:03.137
since from the age of 13, until about

157
00:06:03.137 --> 00:06:05.284
24 or 25.

158
00:06:05.284 --> 00:06:08.081
<v Voiceover>So you were absorbing a lot of</v>

159
00:06:08.081 --> 00:06:09.635
knowledge, both directly,

160
00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:11.612
and subliminally from your grandmother

161
00:06:11.612 --> 00:06:12.799
at that time, as well.

162
00:06:12.799 --> 00:06:13.629
<v ->Exactly.</v>

163
00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:15.395
<v Voiceover>And let's talk a little bit about this,</v>

164
00:06:15.395 --> 00:06:16.882
you were saying, "My life,

165
00:06:16.882 --> 00:06:18.487
"and our family was magical."

166
00:06:18.487 --> 00:06:20.068
Let's talk about

167
00:06:20.068 --> 00:06:21.763
the Toltec way and your family,

168
00:06:21.763 --> 00:06:24.973
and why, what is it about your life that was magical?

169
00:06:24.973 --> 00:06:27.471
<v ->Well magical, in a sense that,</v>

170
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:31.830
imagine living in a family that doesn't have the same rules

171
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.741
as all your friends.

172
00:06:34.741 --> 00:06:36.965
Imagine growing up in a family where,

173
00:06:36.965 --> 00:06:38.662
I would go and pick up my dad,

174
00:06:38.662 --> 00:06:40.000
and my dad would say,

175
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.504
"All right, are you gonna tell me,

176
00:06:41.504 --> 00:06:43.246
"or should I tell you?"

177
00:06:43.246 --> 00:06:45.123
Something I did when he was away,

178
00:06:45.123 --> 00:06:47.310
one time I actually decided to test him,

179
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.089
and I says, "Okay tell me."

180
00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:51.339
"Well, you did this, this, and that."

181
00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:52.804
"How did you know?"

182
00:06:52.804 --> 00:06:53.582
(laughs)

183
00:06:53.582 --> 00:06:54.728
So, growing up in a place

184
00:06:54.728 --> 00:06:57.524
where you couldn't get away with much, you know,

185
00:06:57.524 --> 00:07:00.084
he knew, and my grandma knew.

186
00:07:00.084 --> 00:07:02.459
Also, with my grandma,

187
00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:04.017
growing up with her beliefs,

188
00:07:04.017 --> 00:07:05.550
with her, like,

189
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.454
she would interact with spirits,

190
00:07:07.454 --> 00:07:09.057
she would interact with, you know,

191
00:07:09.057 --> 00:07:11.328
she would do cleansings, she would do exorcisms,

192
00:07:11.328 --> 00:07:12.334
she would do

193
00:07:12.334 --> 00:07:14.606
all of these wonderful miracles, you know,

194
00:07:14.606 --> 00:07:16.743
people would be very, very sick

195
00:07:16.743 --> 00:07:18.111
and then all of the sudden,

196
00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:19.460
they got cured.

197
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.963
She cured a person who had cancer.

198
00:07:21.963 --> 00:07:22.994
You know, she,

199
00:07:22.994 --> 00:07:24.887
there was a person who was bed-ridden,

200
00:07:24.887 --> 00:07:26.857
and she would go and do her prayers,

201
00:07:26.857 --> 00:07:29.505
do her healings,

202
00:07:29.505 --> 00:07:31.576
and the person, from

203
00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:33.848
being quadriplegic, to being in a wheelchair,

204
00:07:33.848 --> 00:07:37.228
from being in the wheelchair to standing.

205
00:07:37.228 --> 00:07:38.909
And then watching the interaction between

206
00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:41.645
my grandma and my dad,

207
00:07:41.645 --> 00:07:43.702
sometimes it'd be interesting.

208
00:07:43.702 --> 00:07:45.137
You know sometimes,

209
00:07:45.137 --> 00:07:47.901
you walk in to a conversation,

210
00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:51.171
and there was no one around,

211
00:07:51.171 --> 00:07:53.468
but, you know my grandma was,

212
00:07:53.468 --> 00:07:56.592
had something in her system,

213
00:07:56.592 --> 00:07:59.830
like, it was more like,

214
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.224
a different being.

215
00:08:01.224 --> 00:08:03.113
Like, you know when you do a meditation

216
00:08:03.113 --> 00:08:05.149
and all of the sudden you start talking

217
00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:08.406
in a different person, completely.

218
00:08:08.406 --> 00:08:10.030
And my dad would be talking to her,

219
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.840
and it would be an interesting interaction.

220
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.012
And then all of the sudden,

221
00:08:14.012 --> 00:08:15.356
you know, also the people who

222
00:08:15.356 --> 00:08:17.674
came in to see my grandma were very interesting.

223
00:08:17.674 --> 00:08:21.415
Like Angel Debbie, I met her.

224
00:08:21.415 --> 00:08:24.274
City Gyaan, all of these people

225
00:08:24.274 --> 00:08:26.161
who just came into our lives,

226
00:08:26.161 --> 00:08:29.122
you know, yogis and Buddhists who came into,

227
00:08:29.122 --> 00:08:30.393
you know there was actually Buddhists

228
00:08:30.393 --> 00:08:33.105
who wanted to take me to their temple and my dad said no.

229
00:08:33.105 --> 00:08:34.936
And, it's interesting.

230
00:08:34.936 --> 00:08:36.371
<v Voiceover>It was a magical life.</v>

231
00:08:36.371 --> 00:08:37.296
<v ->It was magical,</v>

232
00:08:37.296 --> 00:08:39.528
and it was one of the things that,

233
00:08:39.528 --> 00:08:41.721
you know, for the longest time it was really hard

234
00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:45.808
to separate between my high school friends

235
00:08:45.808 --> 00:08:47.960
and my junior high school friends,

236
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.858
and my life.

237
00:08:48.858 --> 00:08:49.902
You know, Jose

238
00:08:49.902 --> 00:08:51.529
did something very similar.

239
00:08:51.529 --> 00:08:52.500
<v Voiceover>Jose, your brother.</v>

240
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.319
<v ->My brother, Don Jose.</v>

241
00:08:53.319 --> 00:08:55.297
Don Jose

242
00:08:55.297 --> 00:08:57.677
was in his own rebellion as well.

243
00:08:57.677 --> 00:09:00.172
And, one time he,

244
00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:03.603
my dad sent them to India,

245
00:09:03.603 --> 00:09:06.319
and when my brother came back from India,

246
00:09:06.319 --> 00:09:08.869
you know, he began to do,

247
00:09:08.869 --> 00:09:10.404
people would ask him to talk,

248
00:09:10.404 --> 00:09:12.443
and he'd start talking, he'd be in parties.

249
00:09:12.443 --> 00:09:13.798
You know, one time, like,

250
00:09:13.798 --> 00:09:14.861
someone was

251
00:09:14.861 --> 00:09:17.486
throwing a teenage party and someone was very, very drunk,

252
00:09:17.486 --> 00:09:18.592
and asked my brother,

253
00:09:18.592 --> 00:09:22.319
"Hey, teach us something you've learned in India."

254
00:09:22.319 --> 00:09:23.533
And he says, "Okay,

255
00:09:23.533 --> 00:09:27.704
"I'll teach you this mantra this yogi taught me."

256
00:09:27.704 --> 00:09:29.427
So he sang to a bunch of,

257
00:09:29.427 --> 00:09:31.939
a group of people, and they're all heavy metal guys,

258
00:09:31.939 --> 00:09:33.592
so they're very long hair

259
00:09:33.592 --> 00:09:36.185
and have tattoos and piercings.

260
00:09:36.185 --> 00:09:37.522
And, you know,

261
00:09:37.522 --> 00:09:39.843
my brother started doing his chant,

262
00:09:39.843 --> 00:09:42.093
something very similar and they,

263
00:09:42.093 --> 00:09:44.202
I don't remember it.

264
00:09:44.202 --> 00:09:47.932
But, these people who've never meditated

265
00:09:47.932 --> 00:09:49.157
in their life,

266
00:09:49.157 --> 00:09:51.422
never sat in the lotus position,

267
00:09:51.422 --> 00:09:55.769
never could stand still for more than ten minutes,

268
00:09:55.769 --> 00:09:58.214
did it for 45 minutes.

269
00:09:58.214 --> 00:10:00.791
There he was, my brother chanting away,

270
00:10:00.791 --> 00:10:02.569
everyone all of the sudden,

271
00:10:02.569 --> 00:10:05.568
once they knew the words, they began to chant,

272
00:10:05.568 --> 00:10:07.761
and they began to do that.

273
00:10:07.761 --> 00:10:09.203
And at the end of it,

274
00:10:09.203 --> 00:10:10.640
that friend who was really drunk

275
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.119
who had instigated this,

276
00:10:12.119 --> 00:10:14.325
says, "Jose, what have you done?

277
00:10:14.325 --> 00:10:16.633
"I'm no longer drunk!

278
00:10:16.633 --> 00:10:17.998
"What did you do to me?"

279
00:10:17.998 --> 00:10:19.767
And he says, "I didn't do anything,

280
00:10:19.767 --> 00:10:21.529
"we just did this."

281
00:10:21.529 --> 00:10:22.600
<v Voiceover>That's wonderful.</v>

282
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.356
<v ->So now, my brother does that now,</v>

283
00:10:24.356 --> 00:10:27.005
it's like I see my brothers doing what magic

284
00:10:27.005 --> 00:10:29.737
my dad did.

285
00:10:29.737 --> 00:10:32.829
And the most powerful thing I ever seen my dad do,

286
00:10:32.829 --> 00:10:35.620
was, he was in

287
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.192
Peru,

288
00:10:37.192 --> 00:10:40.980
in the Inca, in the Machu Picchu,

289
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.878
and he says, "Do you want me to see me

290
00:10:44.878 --> 00:10:47.102
"bring the fog?"

291
00:10:47.102 --> 00:10:48.712
And all of the sudden,

292
00:10:48.712 --> 00:10:50.121
he says, "It'll be,

293
00:10:50.121 --> 00:10:53.578
"in a few minutes, you won't be able to see your nose."

294
00:10:53.578 --> 00:10:56.490
In a few minutes the fog came,

295
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.911
and it was completely surrounding Machu Picchu.

296
00:10:59.911 --> 00:11:02.420
And my dad says, "Do you want to see it

297
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:06.181
"disappear and be a clear sky?"

298
00:11:06.181 --> 00:11:08.538
In a few minutes the fog passed,

299
00:11:08.538 --> 00:11:12.575
beautiful, clear sky.

300
00:11:12.575 --> 00:11:15.369
<v Voiceover>So, who are the Toltec?</v>

301
00:11:15.369 --> 00:11:17.090
What is the Toltec way?

302
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.930
<v ->The Toltec,</v>

303
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.150
in our family, in our tradition,

304
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.842
because the way our family teaches us

305
00:11:24.842 --> 00:11:28.366
is passed from generation after generation.

306
00:11:28.366 --> 00:11:30.527
So by our family's definition,

307
00:11:30.527 --> 00:11:32.691
a Toltec is an artist.

308
00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:35.038
A Toltec existed with the Aztecs,

309
00:11:35.038 --> 00:11:36.326
with the Olmecs,

310
00:11:36.326 --> 00:11:37.835
with everyone,

311
00:11:37.835 --> 00:11:39.863
every civilization had Toltecs.

312
00:11:39.863 --> 00:11:42.041
And they're just called artists.

313
00:11:42.041 --> 00:11:44.333
<v Voiceover>But not art in the usual sense.</v>

314
00:11:44.333 --> 00:11:45.933
<v ->Art in the usual sense, yes.</v>

315
00:11:45.933 --> 00:11:46.930
<v Voiceover>But beyond?</v>

316
00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:47.688
<v ->Yes.</v>

317
00:11:47.688 --> 00:11:49.147
Basically the whole,

318
00:11:49.147 --> 00:11:51.429
the art was our art,

319
00:11:51.429 --> 00:11:52.773
life was our art.

320
00:11:52.773 --> 00:11:55.441
Our Toltecs are the military,

321
00:11:55.441 --> 00:11:57.708
our Toltec were the priest.

322
00:11:57.708 --> 00:11:59.289
Toltec were everyone

323
00:11:59.289 --> 00:12:01.918
who began to learn.

324
00:12:01.918 --> 00:12:05.009
That's how we know it in our tradition.

325
00:12:05.009 --> 00:12:06.487
And,

326
00:12:06.487 --> 00:12:08.028
in archaeology,

327
00:12:08.028 --> 00:12:09.854
you can say that there's a civilization

328
00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:12.360
that existed in Tula, in Teotihuacan,

329
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.544
that the Toltec were here.

330
00:12:15.544 --> 00:12:17.248
But according to our traditions,

331
00:12:17.248 --> 00:12:19.509
and based on our traditions,

332
00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:23.468
it comes from the word, "artist."

333
00:12:23.468 --> 00:12:25.544
So, whether or not like that's,

334
00:12:25.544 --> 00:12:27.075
that's how we know it.

335
00:12:27.075 --> 00:12:28.931
<v Voiceover>But it's living life with a higher</v>

336
00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:31.990
level of artistry, of creating one's own life.

337
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.965
<v ->Yes.</v>

338
00:12:32.965 --> 00:12:35.307
It, in order to be a Toltec,

339
00:12:35.307 --> 00:12:38.053
first thing you have to do is learn

340
00:12:38.053 --> 00:12:39.820
the mastery of awareness,

341
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.492
to be aware, one that we are dreaming,

342
00:12:42.492 --> 00:12:44.473
but also be aware of our word,

343
00:12:44.473 --> 00:12:47.930
of our actions, of why we do this, why.

344
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:49.916
Once we are aware,

345
00:12:49.916 --> 00:12:52.735
we do the mastery of transformation,

346
00:12:52.735 --> 00:12:54.401
which is changing our dream,

347
00:12:54.401 --> 00:12:55.683
changing our lifestyle,

348
00:12:55.683 --> 00:12:57.808
changing so that

349
00:12:57.808 --> 00:13:01.568
we create the last mastery, which is the mastery of love,

350
00:13:01.568 --> 00:13:05.194
which is to being in love, 24/7, all the time,

351
00:13:05.194 --> 00:13:07.245
a whole life is love.

352
00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:08.540
Even as a warrior,

353
00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.741
even as a priest,

354
00:13:10.741 --> 00:13:12.858
even as the architect,

355
00:13:12.858 --> 00:13:16.083
even as anything we desire to be,

356
00:13:16.083 --> 00:13:19.637
and that's how our family,

357
00:13:19.637 --> 00:13:22.495
we know what a Toltec is, an artist.

358
00:13:22.495 --> 00:13:26.060
Our whole life is a white canvas.

359
00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.517
We can erase it, recreate it,

360
00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:33.256
and there's something in our canvas that we do not like,

361
00:13:33.256 --> 00:13:34.603
we erase it,

362
00:13:34.603 --> 00:13:36.287
and we start anew.

363
00:13:36.287 --> 00:13:37.282
<v Voiceover>You don't carry it,</v>

364
00:13:37.282 --> 00:13:38.430
you don't beat yourself up,

365
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:39.490
let's talk about

366
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.971
some of the exercises, you mentioned one today,

367
00:13:41.971 --> 00:13:44.195
that your father used to have you and your brother do,

368
00:13:44.195 --> 00:13:46.264
which was to imagine yourself,

369
00:13:46.264 --> 00:13:47.783
running with your eyes closed

370
00:13:47.783 --> 00:13:50.127
in a meditation, running, just running,

371
00:13:50.127 --> 00:13:51.425
completely focused,

372
00:13:51.425 --> 00:13:53.160
for hours at a time.

373
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.250
Most people can't do that for one minute at a time.

374
00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:56.803
<v ->No, well,</v>

375
00:13:56.803 --> 00:13:59.066
that started when my grandma taught him,

376
00:13:59.066 --> 00:14:00.462
my dad that.

377
00:14:00.462 --> 00:14:03.339
Imagine having that exercise

378
00:14:03.339 --> 00:14:06.141
for every Sunday,

379
00:14:06.141 --> 00:14:09.046
every day, from eight o'clock in the morning,

380
00:14:09.046 --> 00:14:10.261
until about three o'clock,

381
00:14:10.261 --> 00:14:11.115
or seven o'clock,

382
00:14:11.115 --> 00:14:12.000
depending on the day.

383
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.592
<v Voiceover>The same exercise?</v>

384
00:14:12.592 --> 00:14:13.372
<v ->Yeah, sometimes.</v>

385
00:14:13.372 --> 00:14:14.297
<v Voiceover>She would have him do that for--</v>

386
00:14:14.297 --> 00:14:16.199
<v ->Or something very similar, you know,</v>

387
00:14:16.199 --> 00:14:18.025
but the whole point of it

388
00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:20.948
is that, you learn, one,

389
00:14:20.948 --> 00:14:23.204
what discipline is.

390
00:14:23.204 --> 00:14:25.431
Because our attention is everywhere,

391
00:14:25.431 --> 00:14:26.803
you know, just like a child,

392
00:14:26.803 --> 00:14:28.388
our attention, we're hooked,

393
00:14:28.388 --> 00:14:30.564
by everything, constantly.

394
00:14:30.564 --> 00:14:32.447
And if you ever close your eyes,

395
00:14:32.447 --> 00:14:33.706
and just be still,

396
00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:35.588
and you try to do a chant,

397
00:14:35.588 --> 00:14:37.176
like an om,

398
00:14:37.176 --> 00:14:40.201
it takes a while for our whole attention to get into the om,

399
00:14:40.201 --> 00:14:42.103
that's the whole purpose of an om.

400
00:14:42.103 --> 00:14:43.527
When we go into that om,

401
00:14:43.527 --> 00:14:47.068
it hooks our attention, it just puts it right there.

402
00:14:47.068 --> 00:14:49.263
It makes it so easy.

403
00:14:49.263 --> 00:14:50.972
So when the exercise,

404
00:14:50.972 --> 00:14:52.994
when we do the running on the beach,

405
00:14:52.994 --> 00:14:54.994
it's the equivalent of an om,

406
00:14:54.994 --> 00:14:58.071
but it's harder, because one, you're not chanting,

407
00:14:58.071 --> 00:15:00.721
one, you're not making a physical exercise,

408
00:15:00.721 --> 00:15:03.662
it's all in our mind, in our imagination.

409
00:15:03.662 --> 00:15:07.319
You can't move a muscle, you can't scratch your nose.

410
00:15:07.319 --> 00:15:09.890
And you have to do it.

411
00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:11.723
<v Voiceover>And what was the purpose of this exercise,</v>

412
00:15:11.723 --> 00:15:15.006
in terms of gaining that mental power, or will,

413
00:15:15.006 --> 00:15:18.258
the ability to use your will over your mind?

414
00:15:18.258 --> 00:15:20.516
<v ->The power of the will,</v>

415
00:15:20.516 --> 00:15:22.919
we can say our will is our word,

416
00:15:22.919 --> 00:15:26.334
our will is what manifests life,

417
00:15:26.334 --> 00:15:28.369
what we do, when we do it,

418
00:15:28.369 --> 00:15:30.942
action, reaction.

419
00:15:30.942 --> 00:15:34.289
That is the force by which we create.

420
00:15:34.289 --> 00:15:37.420
If our will is strong, we can stay focused,

421
00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:40.837
we can manifest anything,

422
00:15:40.837 --> 00:15:43.187
if it's not strong, if our will's not strong,

423
00:15:43.187 --> 00:15:46.004
we'll be tempted to give into

424
00:15:46.004 --> 00:15:47.794
our, "I'll do it later,"

425
00:15:47.794 --> 00:15:50.519
or, I remember doing this,

426
00:15:50.519 --> 00:15:52.305
I'll scratch my nose and,

427
00:15:52.305 --> 00:15:56.542
anything that keeps us away from what we have to do.

428
00:15:56.542 --> 00:15:57.978
And in this sense, our,

429
00:15:57.978 --> 00:16:00.273
what we wanted to do is learn

430
00:16:00.273 --> 00:16:03.315
to have that discipline to transform.

431
00:16:03.315 --> 00:16:04.602
To be able

432
00:16:04.602 --> 00:16:06.408
to have the discipline

433
00:16:06.408 --> 00:16:09.828
to transform that white canvas,

434
00:16:09.828 --> 00:16:11.947
and create our art.

435
00:16:11.947 --> 00:16:13.851
Because it's so easy to give into

436
00:16:13.851 --> 00:16:16.196
the temptation of our judgement.

437
00:16:16.196 --> 00:16:18.749
It's so easy to give into temptation of our,

438
00:16:18.749 --> 00:16:20.955
our victim, our parasite.

439
00:16:20.955 --> 00:16:24.212
It's very easy to give in to our hate,

440
00:16:24.212 --> 00:16:27.763
to our envy, to our judgements, to our

441
00:16:27.763 --> 00:16:31.469
jealousy, to any, to our insecurities,

442
00:16:31.469 --> 00:16:35.493
or any of the stories that goes against us.

443
00:16:35.493 --> 00:16:38.489
It's the easiest thing.

444
00:16:38.489 --> 00:16:40.889
The easiest thing in a romance,

445
00:16:40.889 --> 00:16:43.456
in a relationship with romance,

446
00:16:43.456 --> 00:16:46.461
is to go negative, to go into our wound,

447
00:16:46.461 --> 00:16:48.432
to judge, to victimize,

448
00:16:48.432 --> 00:16:51.063
to be very negative.

449
00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:54.867
It's only, and it's easy

450
00:16:54.867 --> 00:16:57.305
because that's the way we learned it.

451
00:16:57.305 --> 00:16:59.724
<v Voiceover>And you talk about this a great deal,</v>

452
00:16:59.724 --> 00:17:01.123
about how we learn.

453
00:17:01.123 --> 00:17:02.883
And this is important to that,

454
00:17:02.883 --> 00:17:04.976
because we start learning through words.

455
00:17:04.976 --> 00:17:06.641
We start as a blank canvas.

456
00:17:06.641 --> 00:17:07.399
<v ->Yes.</v>

457
00:17:07.399 --> 00:17:09.782
<v Voiceover>In essence, I mean depending on if you</v>

458
00:17:09.782 --> 00:17:11.830
talk about what your bring from another lifetime,

459
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:13.926
or whatnot but essentially as a baby,

460
00:17:13.926 --> 00:17:16.261
we are a relatively blank canvas.

461
00:17:16.261 --> 00:17:17.118
<v ->Exactly.</v>

462
00:17:17.118 --> 00:17:18.680
<v Voiceover>You have to learn to have those wounds</v>

463
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.218
before you can have that judgement of the person

464
00:17:21.218 --> 00:17:24.344
that you're involved with in a love affair, for example,

465
00:17:24.344 --> 00:17:24.952
right?

466
00:17:24.952 --> 00:17:26.831
<v ->Yes, we have to be domesticated.</v>

467
00:17:26.831 --> 00:17:27.509
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

468
00:17:27.509 --> 00:17:28.448
<v ->In other words,</v>

469
00:17:28.448 --> 00:17:29.243
you can say,

470
00:17:29.243 --> 00:17:31.654
you need to learn how to function

471
00:17:31.654 --> 00:17:35.009
in this society, in this dream.

472
00:17:35.009 --> 00:17:36.038
You know, but,

473
00:17:36.038 --> 00:17:39.375
each one of us grows up in a family

474
00:17:39.375 --> 00:17:42.720
with a set belief system with set rules,

475
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.116
and we are domesticated to that.

476
00:17:46.116 --> 00:17:48.229
Then, we learn to function

477
00:17:48.229 --> 00:17:50.110
in the society our family lives in,

478
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.502
you know, the community,

479
00:17:51.502 --> 00:17:53.931
and we learn to live in that community.

480
00:17:53.931 --> 00:17:56.093
And, when we learn that community,

481
00:17:56.093 --> 00:17:58.686
we being to function and be

482
00:17:58.686 --> 00:18:01.621
either productive in that community, or not be productive.

483
00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:05.259
You know, the community itself has its rules.

484
00:18:05.259 --> 00:18:06.954
The family has its rules.

485
00:18:06.954 --> 00:18:09.116
So in order to function with them,

486
00:18:09.116 --> 00:18:11.067
we need to know those rules.

487
00:18:11.067 --> 00:18:13.086
Language is one of them.

488
00:18:13.086 --> 00:18:14.460
Without language, there's no

489
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.939
form of communicating between you and I.

490
00:18:16.939 --> 00:18:18.121
If not language,

491
00:18:18.121 --> 00:18:19.816
I would make gestures to you,

492
00:18:19.816 --> 00:18:22.845
and hopefully you would understand what I'm trying to say,

493
00:18:22.845 --> 00:18:23.417
you know?

494
00:18:23.417 --> 00:18:24.177
<v Voiceover>And at the same time,</v>

495
00:18:24.177 --> 00:18:25.674
it's the very thing that divides us.

496
00:18:25.674 --> 00:18:26.261
<v ->Exactly.</v>

497
00:18:26.261 --> 00:18:26.762
<v Voiceover>Because we each have</v>

498
00:18:26.762 --> 00:18:28.231
very different understandings of

499
00:18:28.231 --> 00:18:30.537
any and all words.

500
00:18:30.537 --> 00:18:32.597
<v ->Yet at the same time,</v>

501
00:18:32.597 --> 00:18:33.774
our biggest mistake is

502
00:18:33.774 --> 00:18:35.142
believing that everyone else believes

503
00:18:35.142 --> 00:18:36.326
the same thing we believe.

504
00:18:36.326 --> 00:18:37.435
<v Voiceover>Right, right.</v>

505
00:18:37.435 --> 00:18:39.210
<v ->You know, it's,</v>

506
00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:40.743
we domesticate ourselves,

507
00:18:40.743 --> 00:18:44.374
we grow up in a society, and we believe.

508
00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:47.475
And the reason why we believe is because we love.

509
00:18:47.475 --> 00:18:49.552
Why would I doubt my dad?

510
00:18:49.552 --> 00:18:50.774
Why would I doubt my mom?

511
00:18:50.774 --> 00:18:52.455
Why would I doubt my family?

512
00:18:52.455 --> 00:18:54.747
Why would I doubt my priest or my preacher,

513
00:18:54.747 --> 00:18:57.188
or my,

514
00:18:57.188 --> 00:18:59.996
whatever term it is.

515
00:18:59.996 --> 00:19:01.722
Our teachers,

516
00:19:01.722 --> 00:19:04.163
our president,

517
00:19:04.163 --> 00:19:05.998
why would I doubt them?

518
00:19:05.998 --> 00:19:07.209
You know, when we're children,

519
00:19:07.209 --> 00:19:08.292
we're innocent,

520
00:19:08.292 --> 00:19:10.821
and we're innocent because we believe

521
00:19:10.821 --> 00:19:14.333
anything the people we love say.

522
00:19:14.333 --> 00:19:16.358
<v Voiceover>Yet your father taught you</v>

523
00:19:16.358 --> 00:19:18.116
some basic rules you lived by,

524
00:19:18.116 --> 00:19:19.608
which was, one was,

525
00:19:19.608 --> 00:19:21.055
don't believe me.

526
00:19:21.055 --> 00:19:22.482
<v ->Mhmm, which is the easy one.</v>

527
00:19:22.482 --> 00:19:23.485
<v Voiceover>But learn to listen.</v>

528
00:19:23.485 --> 00:19:25.020
Don't believe yourself.

529
00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:25.966
<v ->Which was very difficult.</v>

530
00:19:25.966 --> 00:19:26.804
<v Voiceover>But learn to listen.</v>

531
00:19:26.804 --> 00:19:28.618
Don't believe anyone else,

532
00:19:28.618 --> 00:19:29.845
but learn to listen.

533
00:19:29.845 --> 00:19:32.245
What did that mean in your life?

534
00:19:32.245 --> 00:19:34.310
Don't believe the words of others,

535
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.500
even yourself, but learn to listen?

536
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.221
<v ->To be skeptical,</v>

537
00:19:38.221 --> 00:19:40.879
is to really

538
00:19:40.879 --> 00:19:42.680
be aware

539
00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.566
that every one is talking from their point of view.

540
00:19:45.566 --> 00:19:46.845
It has nothing to do with me,

541
00:19:46.845 --> 00:19:48.996
even someone who loves me,

542
00:19:48.996 --> 00:19:51.657
their love has nothing to do with me,

543
00:19:51.657 --> 00:19:53.606
absolutely nothing.

544
00:19:53.606 --> 00:19:56.753
They love me, because they see something about,

545
00:19:56.753 --> 00:19:59.520
in me that they love about themselves.

546
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.410
And that's actually something very fearful

547
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.891
for some of us who

548
00:20:03.891 --> 00:20:05.252
doesn't understand that.

549
00:20:05.252 --> 00:20:06.126
You know, it's just like,

550
00:20:06.126 --> 00:20:07.087
what do you mean?

551
00:20:07.087 --> 00:20:09.546
That means you're not loving me for who I am?

552
00:20:09.546 --> 00:20:12.748
That fear comes up, it's like, wait a minute,

553
00:20:12.748 --> 00:20:14.829
I thought it was about me.

554
00:20:14.829 --> 00:20:16.921
I thought...

555
00:20:16.921 --> 00:20:19.232
And that's what the natural reaction is,

556
00:20:19.232 --> 00:20:21.393
when we put our personal importance,

557
00:20:21.393 --> 00:20:24.959
when we put our love outside of ourselves.

558
00:20:24.959 --> 00:20:28.588
We always think that someone's gonna take it away.

559
00:20:28.588 --> 00:20:31.066
And because we have a fear that someone's gonna take it away

560
00:20:31.066 --> 00:20:33.815
we cling to it.

561
00:20:33.815 --> 00:20:34.945
And the problem is,

562
00:20:34.945 --> 00:20:37.545
that we make the mistake of not realizing

563
00:20:37.545 --> 00:20:41.046
that the only person taking that away is me.

564
00:20:41.046 --> 00:20:42.595
Because when someone leaves us,

565
00:20:42.595 --> 00:20:44.610
when someone, when we have a break-up,

566
00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.955
when someone breaks up with us,

567
00:20:46.955 --> 00:20:49.510
it is me who's taking the love away,

568
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:50.965
not that person.

569
00:20:50.965 --> 00:20:52.696
Yet it looks like it because

570
00:20:52.696 --> 00:20:56.119
that person was validating something about me.

571
00:20:56.119 --> 00:20:57.685
<v Voiceover>Yes, and this gets into</v>

572
00:20:57.685 --> 00:20:59.841
a big fear that most human beings have,

573
00:20:59.841 --> 00:21:01.636
which in the Toltec way,

574
00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:04.507
you address from a very early age, which is,

575
00:21:04.507 --> 00:21:05.930
we come into the world alone,

576
00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.544
we experience life, essentially alone,

577
00:21:08.544 --> 00:21:10.221
and die alone, it doesn't mean

578
00:21:10.221 --> 00:21:12.191
that we don't have parallel characters,

579
00:21:12.191 --> 00:21:13.623
we're having our experiences with,

580
00:21:13.623 --> 00:21:15.797
but what is the essential difference,

581
00:21:15.797 --> 00:21:19.299
for you personally, in having been raised this way,

582
00:21:19.299 --> 00:21:22.225
to understand this is your journey,

583
00:21:22.225 --> 00:21:24.452
you're alone,

584
00:21:24.452 --> 00:21:27.902
what did that mean for you?

585
00:21:27.902 --> 00:21:29.627
<v ->The first time I realized this,</v>

586
00:21:29.627 --> 00:21:32.603
it meant a lot of fear.

587
00:21:32.603 --> 00:21:33.569
It was,

588
00:21:33.569 --> 00:21:35.339
I would say the most,

589
00:21:35.339 --> 00:21:37.124
the most fear I've ever had,

590
00:21:37.124 --> 00:21:40.928
to realize that I was alone.

591
00:21:40.928 --> 00:21:42.675
And when I realized that,

592
00:21:42.675 --> 00:21:43.977
I realized that

593
00:21:43.977 --> 00:21:46.055
all my fears in relationships,

594
00:21:46.055 --> 00:21:47.471
all my fears

595
00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:49.172
in the way I handle myself,

596
00:21:49.172 --> 00:21:52.092
in the projection of who I am,

597
00:21:52.092 --> 00:21:53.980
even the persona that I created,

598
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.313
was all based on fear.

599
00:21:55.313 --> 00:21:57.780
Everything I did

600
00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:02.203
was for the fear of not being accepted.

601
00:22:02.203 --> 00:22:05.046
And acceptance, the reward of being accepted

602
00:22:05.046 --> 00:22:06.480
is that I won't be alone,

603
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.562
I have company.

604
00:22:07.562 --> 00:22:09.482
There'll be people around me.

605
00:22:09.482 --> 00:22:11.373
It's just like when we were growing up,

606
00:22:11.373 --> 00:22:13.447
when were taught

607
00:22:13.447 --> 00:22:15.989
with reward and punishment.

608
00:22:15.989 --> 00:22:17.834
I did something right, "Yay!"

609
00:22:17.834 --> 00:22:20.413
I did something wrong, "No, try again."

610
00:22:20.413 --> 00:22:22.110
You know, we never stop doing that.

611
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:23.823
I never stopped doing that.

612
00:22:23.823 --> 00:22:25.032
<v Voiceover>How did you,</v>

613
00:22:25.032 --> 00:22:27.766
what did you do with the knowledge you have,

614
00:22:27.766 --> 00:22:30.940
to begin taking this notion on-board and accepting it,

615
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.801
and where did it take you?

616
00:22:33.801 --> 00:22:35.741
<v ->Well when I realized this,</v>

617
00:22:35.741 --> 00:22:37.406
you can say,

618
00:22:37.406 --> 00:22:39.316
it was the first time I picked up

619
00:22:39.316 --> 00:22:42.462
the book of "The Four Agreements" for the very first time,

620
00:22:42.462 --> 00:22:44.166
under this point of view.

621
00:22:44.166 --> 00:22:45.445
<v Voiceover>And when you read it,</v>

622
00:22:45.445 --> 00:22:47.089
what was different when you read it this time?

623
00:22:47.089 --> 00:22:49.727
Which, I think this is one of the most essential books

624
00:22:49.727 --> 00:22:50.873
for every human being,

625
00:22:50.873 --> 00:22:52.171
that's ever been written.

626
00:22:52.171 --> 00:22:55.577
<v ->You see, before this moment in time,</v>

627
00:22:55.577 --> 00:22:58.115
that book was my dad talking to me.

628
00:22:58.115 --> 00:23:00.216
And like any child,

629
00:23:00.216 --> 00:23:01.686
dad's talking to me,

630
00:23:01.686 --> 00:23:05.811
it's my dad telling me what to do.

631
00:23:05.811 --> 00:23:08.489
And after that moment,

632
00:23:08.489 --> 00:23:11.671
I saw it for the work of art that it is.

633
00:23:11.671 --> 00:23:13.402
Because all of the sudden,

634
00:23:13.402 --> 00:23:14.968
in realizing my fears,

635
00:23:14.968 --> 00:23:16.509
in realizing

636
00:23:16.509 --> 00:23:21.509
that I wasn't authentic with myself,

637
00:23:21.547 --> 00:23:25.138
I was completely vulnerable.

638
00:23:25.138 --> 00:23:26.031
You can say,

639
00:23:26.031 --> 00:23:29.037
it was the most naked I ever was.

640
00:23:29.037 --> 00:23:30.754
And it was the moment where

641
00:23:30.754 --> 00:23:33.302
anyone could see me.

642
00:23:33.302 --> 00:23:35.855
And I used everything

643
00:23:35.855 --> 00:23:38.485
to shield me from it.

644
00:23:38.485 --> 00:23:40.195
My disguise,

645
00:23:40.195 --> 00:23:43.017
my personal importance, the way I dressed,

646
00:23:43.017 --> 00:23:44.603
the music I listened to.

647
00:23:44.603 --> 00:23:46.489
Because even, I even listened to music

648
00:23:46.489 --> 00:23:48.980
not because I liked it, but because it was acceptable.

649
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:49.933
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

650
00:23:49.933 --> 00:23:51.272
<v ->And when I relaized</v>

651
00:23:51.272 --> 00:23:54.934
that I was doing this to myself,

652
00:23:54.934 --> 00:23:57.858
well, I had one choice.

653
00:23:57.858 --> 00:24:00.172
Well, two.

654
00:24:00.172 --> 00:24:03.364
I continue being like this,

655
00:24:03.364 --> 00:24:05.782
or I can say, "Stop,

656
00:24:05.782 --> 00:24:08.226
"I want to change."

657
00:24:08.226 --> 00:24:09.582
And as we can say,

658
00:24:09.582 --> 00:24:10.662
when that moment happened,

659
00:24:10.662 --> 00:24:12.652
it came from that moment where

660
00:24:12.652 --> 00:24:16.275
the hurt, the heartbreak was so tough,

661
00:24:16.275 --> 00:24:18.081
and the heartbreak was not,

662
00:24:18.081 --> 00:24:20.997
you know, the catalyst might have been a breakup,

663
00:24:20.997 --> 00:24:24.308
or a song,

664
00:24:24.308 --> 00:24:28.853
but the end result was the truth.

665
00:24:28.853 --> 00:24:30.772
And just like a great teacher

666
00:24:30.772 --> 00:24:32.551
many, many years ago says,

667
00:24:32.551 --> 00:24:35.780
"The truth will set you free."

668
00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:39.445
Well, I was alone.

669
00:24:39.445 --> 00:24:42.984
Isn't that wonderful?

670
00:24:42.984 --> 00:24:44.605
Isn't that wonderful?

671
00:24:44.605 --> 00:24:46.773
All of the sudden, I realized

672
00:24:46.773 --> 00:24:50.794
that there is no such thing as the one,

673
00:24:50.794 --> 00:24:55.082
but if there is, that one is me.

674
00:24:55.082 --> 00:24:57.289
Because from the moment I am born,

675
00:24:57.289 --> 00:24:59.317
to the moment I die,

676
00:24:59.317 --> 00:25:01.725
I am with me.

677
00:25:01.725 --> 00:25:04.904
So the best relationship I'll ever have

678
00:25:04.904 --> 00:25:07.666
is the one with me.

679
00:25:07.666 --> 00:25:11.082
And how wonderful it is that I'm alone,

680
00:25:11.082 --> 00:25:13.949
because whenever someone comes up to me,

681
00:25:13.949 --> 00:25:16.771
I get to share that with them.

682
00:25:16.771 --> 00:25:19.535
I get to share that love,

683
00:25:19.535 --> 00:25:20.859
and all of the sudden,

684
00:25:20.859 --> 00:25:23.815
it doesn't matter whether or not they say yes or no,

685
00:25:23.815 --> 00:25:26.000
it doesn't matter if they accept me,

686
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.181
it doesn't matter if they reject me,

687
00:25:28.181 --> 00:25:30.142
it doesn't matter.

688
00:25:30.142 --> 00:25:31.477
If I say I love you and says,

689
00:25:31.477 --> 00:25:32.989
"Oh, get lost creep."

690
00:25:32.989 --> 00:25:34.122
Well, thanks.

691
00:25:34.122 --> 00:25:36.166
Bye, thank you so much.

692
00:25:36.166 --> 00:25:37.137
<v Voiceover>That's a big part of it,</v>

693
00:25:37.137 --> 00:25:38.421
not taking things personally,

694
00:25:38.421 --> 00:25:39.858
which, of course, is part of the four agreements,

695
00:25:39.858 --> 00:25:42.601
but this is embodied in what you're talking about.

696
00:25:42.601 --> 00:25:43.818
<v ->You see,</v>

697
00:25:43.818 --> 00:25:45.065
that's the whole point.

698
00:25:45.065 --> 00:25:47.122
Before that moment I realized that,

699
00:25:47.122 --> 00:25:51.124
I really thought that everything was because of me.

700
00:25:51.124 --> 00:25:54.547
People behave badly because of me.

701
00:25:54.547 --> 00:25:56.538
Or they rejected or accepted,

702
00:25:56.538 --> 00:25:59.085
and, to a certain degree, you can say, "Yeah,"

703
00:25:59.085 --> 00:26:01.867
from a point of view, "yeah they didn't like you,

704
00:26:01.867 --> 00:26:04.260
"they didn't accept this way, they don't,"

705
00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.525
and all of the sudden realize,

706
00:26:05.525 --> 00:26:07.792
"Yes, that is the truth."

707
00:26:07.792 --> 00:26:10.235
But, it's all based on their belief system.

708
00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:11.972
They're rejecting me from their point of view,

709
00:26:11.972 --> 00:26:13.998
they're rejecting me from that,

710
00:26:13.998 --> 00:26:15.951
they're accepting me from that.

711
00:26:15.951 --> 00:26:20.168
Yet for me,

712
00:26:20.168 --> 00:26:21.397
I realized that

713
00:26:21.397 --> 00:26:25.097
I was the one whose opinion mattered the most.

714
00:26:25.097 --> 00:26:26.733
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

715
00:26:26.733 --> 00:26:29.298
<v ->And just having that love, it was just easy.</v>

716
00:26:29.298 --> 00:26:31.336
After that, learning,

717
00:26:31.336 --> 00:26:33.748
you can say that's when I really began to teach

718
00:26:33.748 --> 00:26:36.322
and learn again from my father, from my grandma,

719
00:26:36.322 --> 00:26:37.720
from every one of those people.

720
00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.909
<v Voiceover>Once you were set free.</v>

721
00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:40.515
<v ->Once I</v>

722
00:26:40.515 --> 00:26:43.995
began to listen to them.

723
00:26:43.995 --> 00:26:44.884
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

724
00:26:44.884 --> 00:26:45.994
<v ->Because before that,</v>

725
00:26:45.994 --> 00:26:48.215
it was my dad talking, it was my grandma talking,

726
00:26:48.215 --> 00:26:50.243
it was my dad's apprentices talking to me,

727
00:26:50.243 --> 00:26:52.165
because my dad's apprentices taught me,

728
00:26:52.165 --> 00:26:53.463
Gini Gentry taught me,

729
00:26:53.463 --> 00:26:56.556
Barbara Emrys, now,

730
00:26:56.556 --> 00:26:59.002
used to be Miller, now it's Emrys,

731
00:26:59.002 --> 00:27:01.228
Gary van Warmerdam taught me.

732
00:27:01.228 --> 00:27:02.868
Allan Hardman taught me.

733
00:27:02.868 --> 00:27:05.091
Don Jose Ruiz taught me.

734
00:27:05.091 --> 00:27:07.480
My brother, Jose Leo taught me,

735
00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.552
and now my wife and my children are teaching me.

736
00:27:10.552 --> 00:27:11.714
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

737
00:27:11.714 --> 00:27:13.770
<v ->And whenever I go and teach,</v>

738
00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:15.088
and do a class,

739
00:27:15.088 --> 00:27:17.285
the class is teaching me.

740
00:27:17.285 --> 00:27:20.425
I'm saying what I know,

741
00:27:20.425 --> 00:27:23.790
but it's the class that's teaching me.

742
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:26.248
<v Voiceover>So when you're empty in this way,</v>

743
00:27:26.248 --> 00:27:27.880
when you've learned to get,

744
00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.350
in essence, past yourself,

745
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:31.509
into this place of

746
00:27:31.509 --> 00:27:33.832
you creating your own canvas,

747
00:27:33.832 --> 00:27:35.449
alone and your journey,

748
00:27:35.449 --> 00:27:36.596
not alone,

749
00:27:36.596 --> 00:27:38.394
and not lonely, but singular,

750
00:27:38.394 --> 00:27:39.795
in your own journey,

751
00:27:39.795 --> 00:27:42.459
it really does make it possible to

752
00:27:42.459 --> 00:27:43.644
see and listen

753
00:27:43.644 --> 00:27:45.545
in a whole new way, doesn't it?

754
00:27:45.545 --> 00:27:46.761
<v ->Yeah.</v>

755
00:27:46.761 --> 00:27:47.923
It allows you to listen.

756
00:27:47.923 --> 00:27:49.024
<v Voiceover>Because you're not trying to protect</v>

757
00:27:49.024 --> 00:27:49.818
who you are and what you are,

758
00:27:49.818 --> 00:27:50.749
the story of who you are,

759
00:27:50.749 --> 00:27:52.682
that's gone, right?

760
00:27:52.682 --> 00:27:53.669
<v ->Yeah.</v>

761
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:54.748
And I think,

762
00:27:54.748 --> 00:27:55.487
and that's

763
00:27:55.487 --> 00:27:58.369
a very key, important thing.

764
00:27:58.369 --> 00:27:59.399
Because,

765
00:27:59.399 --> 00:28:01.418
just like my dad's agreement,

766
00:28:01.418 --> 00:28:02.327
always do your best,

767
00:28:02.327 --> 00:28:04.840
there are days when you'll be able to do your best,

768
00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.257
and there are days when your best is very little.

769
00:28:07.257 --> 00:28:08.536
And same thing with that you described,

770
00:28:08.536 --> 00:28:10.544
there are days when the temptation

771
00:28:10.544 --> 00:28:13.812
to take it personal will be strong.

772
00:28:13.812 --> 00:28:16.335
There are days when my ego will be talking.

773
00:28:16.335 --> 00:28:18.880
There are days when my impatience is ready.

774
00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.653
And the important thing,

775
00:28:22.653 --> 00:28:25.639
the difference between

776
00:28:25.639 --> 00:28:26.781
now and then,

777
00:28:26.781 --> 00:28:29.408
is that then, I would judge myself

778
00:28:29.408 --> 00:28:30.899
for those actions,

779
00:28:30.899 --> 00:28:33.381
now, whenever those happens, I accept it.

780
00:28:33.381 --> 00:28:35.717
That's the way it is.

781
00:28:35.717 --> 00:28:37.284
I am that way.

782
00:28:37.284 --> 00:28:38.634
I am impatient.

783
00:28:38.634 --> 00:28:39.913
I am judgmental.

784
00:28:39.913 --> 00:28:41.010
I am,

785
00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:43.454
and there are days when I am not.

786
00:28:43.454 --> 00:28:45.160
That's the difference, because

787
00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.361
when you have forgiveness,

788
00:28:46.361 --> 00:28:50.279
when you allow yourself to go through life

789
00:28:50.279 --> 00:28:52.120
there are days when the,

790
00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.811
when life puts you all the way down,

791
00:28:54.811 --> 00:28:57.573
and there are days when life puts you all the way up,

792
00:28:57.573 --> 00:28:58.989
and until the day I die,

793
00:28:58.989 --> 00:29:01.065
I'm 32 years old now,

794
00:29:01.065 --> 00:29:02.613
until the day I die,

795
00:29:02.613 --> 00:29:05.418
there will be days where I'm gonna be very tempted

796
00:29:05.418 --> 00:29:07.994
and there'll be days when I'm not tempted at all.

797
00:29:07.994 --> 00:29:10.243
And that's the beauty of it.

798
00:29:10.243 --> 00:29:12.530
You know, I remember once telling

799
00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:14.938
a teacher, or a student,

800
00:29:14.938 --> 00:29:18.362
or someone who went to one of the power journeys,

801
00:29:18.362 --> 00:29:21.407
and he made a great realization,

802
00:29:21.407 --> 00:29:22.735
and I says, "Great.

803
00:29:22.735 --> 00:29:25.908
"Now you get to reconstruct it and do it again."

804
00:29:25.908 --> 00:29:27.368
He says, "What do you mean?"

805
00:29:27.368 --> 00:29:29.936
"Well you have to go back, and re-do it.

806
00:29:29.936 --> 00:29:31.437
"You have to recreate the dream,

807
00:29:31.437 --> 00:29:33.581
"you have to recreate the belief system,

808
00:29:33.581 --> 00:29:35.303
"you have to recreate it."

809
00:29:35.303 --> 00:29:37.329
And he says, "Why?"

810
00:29:37.329 --> 00:29:39.763
"Well you have to function in the world."

811
00:29:39.763 --> 00:29:41.499
"No! I succeeded!"

812
00:29:41.499 --> 00:29:44.714
The thing about it son,

813
00:29:44.714 --> 00:29:48.520
is that you succeeded now,

814
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.644
but you have to do it again and again.

815
00:29:52.644 --> 00:29:55.947
You see, it's easy here in Teotihuacan,

816
00:29:55.947 --> 00:29:58.352
but when you go back to your world--

817
00:29:58.352 --> 00:29:59.341
<v Voiceover>Cincinnati.</v>

818
00:29:59.341 --> 00:30:00.557
<v ->It's going to be difficult,</v>

819
00:30:00.557 --> 00:30:03.239
because everyone remembers you the way you were,

820
00:30:03.239 --> 00:30:05.752
and everyone's expecting you to behave

821
00:30:05.752 --> 00:30:07.211
the way you behaved.

822
00:30:07.211 --> 00:30:09.990
And when you change, and you try to express that,

823
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:12.073
they won't believe you.

824
00:30:12.073 --> 00:30:13.578
<v Voiceover>And they don't want you to be</v>

825
00:30:13.578 --> 00:30:15.010
any different than they know you.

826
00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:15.651
<v ->No,</v>

827
00:30:15.651 --> 00:30:18.038
but here's the most important part,

828
00:30:18.038 --> 00:30:20.736
you'll remember this moment,

829
00:30:20.736 --> 00:30:21.996
and when you go back home,

830
00:30:21.996 --> 00:30:23.245
you'll say, "I used to be,

831
00:30:23.245 --> 00:30:25.581
"I was like this, I reached nirvana,

832
00:30:25.581 --> 00:30:29.314
"I reached this high level of spiritual knowledge.

833
00:30:29.314 --> 00:30:31.079
"I was able to reach that."

834
00:30:31.079 --> 00:30:33.098
And we think, just by remembering it,

835
00:30:33.098 --> 00:30:34.360
it'll be automatic now,

836
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.584
it'll always be the same,

837
00:30:35.584 --> 00:30:37.361
you won't have to put any work.

838
00:30:37.361 --> 00:30:40.701
That's the same mistake I made when I was a little kid.

839
00:30:40.701 --> 00:30:43.903
I am my father's son.

840
00:30:43.903 --> 00:30:45.570
It's easy, I don't have to do

841
00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:48.614
what the rest of these people are doing.

842
00:30:48.614 --> 00:30:49.433
Wrong!

843
00:30:49.433 --> 00:30:50.119
(laughs)

844
00:30:50.119 --> 00:30:51.373
I have to do it, too.

845
00:30:51.373 --> 00:30:52.580
<v Voiceover>Just like he had to do it.</v>

846
00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:53.302
<v ->Yeah.</v>

847
00:30:53.302 --> 00:30:54.556
And we do it over again.

848
00:30:54.556 --> 00:30:56.233
And even if you accomplished

849
00:30:56.233 --> 00:30:58.714
a certain level of understanding,

850
00:30:58.714 --> 00:31:00.615
well, tomorrow's gonna be the next day,

851
00:31:00.615 --> 00:31:01.962
and we might forget,

852
00:31:01.962 --> 00:31:04.169
so we have to do it over again, and over again,

853
00:31:04.169 --> 00:31:06.238
to the point where it's easy.

854
00:31:06.238 --> 00:31:07.405
<v Voiceover>Right, and this is the thing,</v>

855
00:31:07.405 --> 00:31:08.758
the diligence, and I think that,

856
00:31:08.758 --> 00:31:10.190
in each of the books,

857
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:13.548
that's one of the messages I find that comes

858
00:31:13.548 --> 00:31:15.255
through very clearly.

859
00:31:15.255 --> 00:31:17.357
Like you say, you can't assume

860
00:31:17.357 --> 00:31:19.163
that it's just going to be automatic

861
00:31:19.163 --> 00:31:20.674
because you feel it once.

862
00:31:20.674 --> 00:31:21.993
This whole notion

863
00:31:21.993 --> 00:31:24.607
of using your will and repetition,

864
00:31:24.607 --> 00:31:26.604
and practicing,

865
00:31:26.604 --> 00:31:27.895
that is the journey,

866
00:31:27.895 --> 00:31:29.800
on everything, it's just like mastering

867
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.421
any other art in life,

868
00:31:31.421 --> 00:31:34.156
to master the emotions, maybe even more so.

869
00:31:34.156 --> 00:31:34.973
<v ->Exactly.</v>

870
00:31:34.973 --> 00:31:37.083
It's like, like Chopra said in his book,

871
00:31:37.083 --> 00:31:41.322
"Seven Spiritual Laws of Success,"

872
00:31:41.322 --> 00:31:43.263
you do it for a little bit,

873
00:31:43.263 --> 00:31:45.810
you know, for the next two hours I will

874
00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:47.436
practice being

875
00:31:47.436 --> 00:31:50.301
impeccable with my word.

876
00:31:50.301 --> 00:31:51.718
For the next three hours,

877
00:31:51.718 --> 00:31:53.811
I'll practice being,

878
00:31:53.811 --> 00:31:55.904
not taking things personal.

879
00:31:55.904 --> 00:31:58.713
For the next day I'll practice

880
00:31:58.713 --> 00:32:01.978
abundance, happiness.

881
00:32:01.978 --> 00:32:04.946
And little by little, for more you more,

882
00:32:04.946 --> 00:32:08.041
the greater you'll become.

883
00:32:08.041 --> 00:32:09.435
You know, like my dad says,

884
00:32:09.435 --> 00:32:11.290
"Practice makes the master."

885
00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:12.881
<v Voiceover>Yes, and you were saying,</v>

886
00:32:12.881 --> 00:32:13.670
oh I'm sorry go ahead.

887
00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:14.311
<v ->Oh, go for it.</v>

888
00:32:14.311 --> 00:32:15.509
<v Voiceover>No, go ahead.</v>

889
00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:16.101
<v ->No, it's okay.</v>

890
00:32:16.101 --> 00:32:16.722
<v Voiceover>(laughs)</v>

891
00:32:16.722 --> 00:32:18.096
You were saying earlier,

892
00:32:18.096 --> 00:32:20.579
and in fact you talked about this in your class earlier,

893
00:32:20.579 --> 00:32:23.655
that you're the one you're waiting for,

894
00:32:23.655 --> 00:32:25.254
it's not anybody externally,

895
00:32:25.254 --> 00:32:26.976
in terms of everyone waiting for

896
00:32:26.976 --> 00:32:29.124
the big love, the big whatever.

897
00:32:29.124 --> 00:32:30.480
But actually,

898
00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.402
we're the ones

899
00:32:31.402 --> 00:32:32.938
that we're waiting for

900
00:32:32.938 --> 00:32:34.216
and need to integrate with,

901
00:32:34.216 --> 00:32:36.055
and so the notion of

902
00:32:36.055 --> 00:32:38.408
judging ourselves very harshly,

903
00:32:38.408 --> 00:32:40.243
or self-hatred takes on

904
00:32:40.243 --> 00:32:44.699
a much more dynamic meaning.

905
00:32:44.699 --> 00:32:45.954
<v ->It's going against yourself,</v>

906
00:32:45.954 --> 00:32:46.948
it's a sin.

907
00:32:46.948 --> 00:32:47.650
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

908
00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:49.137
<v ->From that point of view.</v>

909
00:32:49.137 --> 00:32:49.816
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

910
00:32:49.816 --> 00:32:51.998
And yet most people judge themselves very harshly.

911
00:32:51.998 --> 00:32:53.601
How did, what did you learn

912
00:32:53.601 --> 00:32:55.056
along your journey about this,

913
00:32:55.056 --> 00:32:56.867
judging oneself harshly?

914
00:32:56.867 --> 00:32:59.342
<v ->Well, when we judge ourself harshly it's because,</v>

915
00:32:59.342 --> 00:33:00.731
we have a belief system.

916
00:33:00.731 --> 00:33:01.960
We have points of views,

917
00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.815
we have a book of law.

918
00:33:04.815 --> 00:33:07.992
And by this book of law we judge others,

919
00:33:07.992 --> 00:33:10.444
we judge what's acceptable, what's not acceptable,

920
00:33:10.444 --> 00:33:12.285
what's cool, what's uncool,

921
00:33:12.285 --> 00:33:14.338
what's hip, what's not hip,

922
00:33:14.338 --> 00:33:17.521
what's appropriate, what is not appropriate,

923
00:33:17.521 --> 00:33:20.295
what's good Christian, what's not good Christian,

924
00:33:20.295 --> 00:33:23.085
what's good Muslim, what's not good Muslim,

925
00:33:23.085 --> 00:33:27.104
what's good Christian, but not good Buddhist,

926
00:33:27.104 --> 00:33:29.100
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,

927
00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.592
we create a belief system about ourselves.

928
00:33:32.592 --> 00:33:36.203
You see, all the information we've ever learned,

929
00:33:36.203 --> 00:33:37.805
we use it on ourselves,

930
00:33:37.805 --> 00:33:40.427
both the positive and the negative.

931
00:33:40.427 --> 00:33:42.015
You know,

932
00:33:42.015 --> 00:33:46.355
we create the persona that is me.

933
00:33:46.355 --> 00:33:49.823
I created Miguel Ruiz Jr.

934
00:33:49.823 --> 00:33:54.092
He is my creation.

935
00:33:54.092 --> 00:33:56.690
And, before,

936
00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:59.211
my creation came with a lot of judgement,

937
00:33:59.211 --> 00:34:02.487
and a lot of victim and a lot of yes,

938
00:34:02.487 --> 00:34:06.234
I'm doing something right when I'm following the rules,

939
00:34:06.234 --> 00:34:08.325
when I'm doing something that I don't agree with,

940
00:34:08.325 --> 00:34:10.507
I'm going to judge myself.

941
00:34:10.507 --> 00:34:13.242
When I'm dressed the way I shouldn't be dressed,

942
00:34:13.242 --> 00:34:15.440
I'm going to criticize myself.

943
00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.426
I did it,

944
00:34:16.426 --> 00:34:17.806
if I put my attention

945
00:34:17.806 --> 00:34:21.872
and my personal importance on how many women

946
00:34:21.872 --> 00:34:23.218
I can attract,

947
00:34:23.218 --> 00:34:25.414
and I didn't get that woman

948
00:34:25.414 --> 00:34:26.780
to be attracted by me,

949
00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.935
I'm going to judge myself really hard.

950
00:34:29.935 --> 00:34:32.962
If I really put my importance in that,

951
00:34:32.962 --> 00:34:34.730
then I mold myself to that,

952
00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:36.753
"Okay, if I want to attract women,

953
00:34:36.753 --> 00:34:38.767
"I have to be this, this, this, and that,

954
00:34:38.767 --> 00:34:41.109
"and shift here, shift there, do this, do that."

955
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:43.439
And, if I don't do it,

956
00:34:43.439 --> 00:34:45.950
well, I'm the stupid one.

957
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:48.198
And I can be really harsh on myself.

958
00:34:49.984 --> 00:34:51.363
The minute

959
00:34:51.363 --> 00:34:53.912
you no longer base your personal importance

960
00:34:53.912 --> 00:34:57.449
on whether or not I'm attractive to a woman,

961
00:34:57.449 --> 00:34:59.484
and who cares if I'm attractive,

962
00:34:59.484 --> 00:35:02.026
everything shifts.

963
00:35:02.026 --> 00:35:03.460
Everything shifts.

964
00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:04.378
<v Voiceover>When you're not looking</v>

965
00:35:04.378 --> 00:35:05.501
for that external approval?

966
00:35:05.501 --> 00:35:06.716
<v ->Exactly.</v>

967
00:35:06.716 --> 00:35:09.626
But that external approval,

968
00:35:09.626 --> 00:35:13.147
I'm actually using that approval to validate me.

969
00:35:13.147 --> 00:35:13.745
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

970
00:35:13.745 --> 00:35:15.015
<v ->You see, I use,</v>

971
00:35:15.015 --> 00:35:16.782
I can use peoples' words,

972
00:35:16.782 --> 00:35:19.455
to go against or in my favor.

973
00:35:19.455 --> 00:35:21.933
And most often than not,

974
00:35:21.933 --> 00:35:23.438
whenever someone,

975
00:35:23.438 --> 00:35:25.691
if someone were to call me stupid,

976
00:35:25.691 --> 00:35:27.183
and I believed them,

977
00:35:27.183 --> 00:35:29.529
I'm using their words against me.

978
00:35:29.529 --> 00:35:32.374
Even though it sounds like that person's saying it to me.

979
00:35:32.374 --> 00:35:33.276
<v Voiceover>You have to buy it.</v>

980
00:35:33.276 --> 00:35:34.619
<v ->I have to buy it.</v>

981
00:35:34.619 --> 00:35:36.544
And if I don't buy it, I don't buy it,

982
00:35:36.544 --> 00:35:38.246
nothing happens, you know.

983
00:35:38.246 --> 00:35:40.411
If this person,

984
00:35:40.411 --> 00:35:42.134
who I don't really consider is that important to me

985
00:35:42.134 --> 00:35:43.177
calls me stupid,

986
00:35:43.177 --> 00:35:44.785
it doesn't even matter anything.

987
00:35:44.785 --> 00:35:46.386
But if it's someone who I really care for,

988
00:35:46.386 --> 00:35:48.396
and calls me stupid, then it's gonna be.

989
00:35:48.396 --> 00:35:52.860
So it's an interesting paradigm in that sense.

990
00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:53.994
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

991
00:35:53.994 --> 00:35:54.544
<v ->But,</v>

992
00:35:54.544 --> 00:35:56.545
it comes to the point where,

993
00:35:56.545 --> 00:36:00.112
when I changed my beliefs about myself,

994
00:36:00.112 --> 00:36:01.609
I will change my belief system,

995
00:36:01.609 --> 00:36:03.919
what's acceptable and what's not acceptable,

996
00:36:03.919 --> 00:36:05.030
and all of the sudden,

997
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:07.389
re-direct that focus.

998
00:36:07.389 --> 00:36:09.724
Everything changes.

999
00:36:09.724 --> 00:36:10.572
Even if,

1000
00:36:10.572 --> 00:36:13.554
even if I'm not taking this path,

1001
00:36:13.554 --> 00:36:15.013
of the Toltec path,

1002
00:36:15.013 --> 00:36:16.008
even if I'm

1003
00:36:16.008 --> 00:36:17.071
shifting,

1004
00:36:17.071 --> 00:36:19.055
we're always changing.

1005
00:36:19.055 --> 00:36:21.350
Our direction, our focus, our belief

1006
00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:23.615
always changes.

1007
00:36:23.615 --> 00:36:24.938
Now it's maybe not for women,

1008
00:36:24.938 --> 00:36:26.894
now it's maybe for political movement.

1009
00:36:26.894 --> 00:36:28.854
If it's not for political movement,

1010
00:36:28.854 --> 00:36:30.027
it's for a religious movement,

1011
00:36:30.027 --> 00:36:32.215
if it's not a religious movement it's for fashion,

1012
00:36:32.215 --> 00:36:33.799
for fashion for music,

1013
00:36:33.799 --> 00:36:36.002
and so on and so forth it can never stop.

1014
00:36:36.002 --> 00:36:39.083
It's infinite.

1015
00:36:39.083 --> 00:36:41.664
But in the end if you learn to satisfy yourself

1016
00:36:41.664 --> 00:36:44.440
and say yes,

1017
00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.582
and just really learn to enjoy.

1018
00:36:47.582 --> 00:36:48.494
<v Voiceover>It's your life.</v>

1019
00:36:48.494 --> 00:36:50.718
<v ->Just to enjoy.</v>

1020
00:36:50.718 --> 00:36:53.627
Then everything is perfect.

1021
00:36:53.627 --> 00:36:55.605
<v Voiceover>Now, you have little children yourself.</v>

1022
00:36:55.605 --> 00:36:56.432
<v ->Yes.</v>

1023
00:36:56.432 --> 00:36:58.002
<v Voiceover>And so,</v>

1024
00:36:58.002 --> 00:37:01.406
how are you, in some ways,

1025
00:37:01.406 --> 00:37:04.230
repeating what your father brought to your life?

1026
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:05.158
(laughs)

1027
00:37:05.158 --> 00:37:06.662
<v ->Well first, I have to domesticate.</v>

1028
00:37:06.662 --> 00:37:09.243
I, some years ago,

1029
00:37:09.243 --> 00:37:12.500
someone was asking me,

1030
00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:15.050
"Why don't we domesticate our children?"

1031
00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:16.582
And I said, "Of course we do.

1032
00:37:16.582 --> 00:37:18.422
"Of course we have to.

1033
00:37:18.422 --> 00:37:21.707
"Otherwise they won't be able to function in this world."

1034
00:37:21.707 --> 00:37:22.598
<v Voiceover>When you say domesticate,</v>

1035
00:37:22.598 --> 00:37:23.547
you mean teach them

1036
00:37:23.547 --> 00:37:24.437
the normal sorts of things

1037
00:37:24.437 --> 00:37:25.807
in the normal sorts of ways?

1038
00:37:25.807 --> 00:37:29.051
<v ->The thing that's like, whether we want to or not,</v>

1039
00:37:29.051 --> 00:37:30.881
we will domesticate our child.

1040
00:37:30.881 --> 00:37:33.434
Even if we say we are not going to domesticate them,

1041
00:37:33.434 --> 00:37:34.975
we are domesticating them,

1042
00:37:34.975 --> 00:37:36.794
because we're teaching them a belief system.

1043
00:37:36.794 --> 00:37:37.853
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1044
00:37:37.853 --> 00:37:39.752
<v ->And the belief system is not to domesticate them,</v>

1045
00:37:39.752 --> 00:37:40.341
okay.

1046
00:37:40.341 --> 00:37:42.656
So they're gonna domesticate them in different ways.

1047
00:37:42.656 --> 00:37:45.265
Because, as a child,

1048
00:37:45.265 --> 00:37:49.083
children get

1049
00:37:49.083 --> 00:37:50.389
their attentions will always

1050
00:37:50.389 --> 00:37:52.566
be hooked by everything they see.

1051
00:37:52.566 --> 00:37:53.836
If it's not gonna be me,

1052
00:37:53.836 --> 00:37:56.086
it's going to be someone else,

1053
00:37:56.086 --> 00:37:57.169
but they will learn.

1054
00:37:57.169 --> 00:37:58.091
<v Voiceover>Because they're here to learn,</v>

1055
00:37:58.091 --> 00:37:58.986
and they're learning.

1056
00:37:58.986 --> 00:37:59.695
<v ->Of course.</v>

1057
00:37:59.695 --> 00:38:01.740
<v Voiceover>But are you bringing through some of the</v>

1058
00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:04.529
family magic for your children?

1059
00:38:04.529 --> 00:38:05.169
<v ->Of course.</v>

1060
00:38:05.169 --> 00:38:06.868
Well you know, it's one of those things that,

1061
00:38:06.868 --> 00:38:08.875
I can't predict the future,

1062
00:38:08.875 --> 00:38:10.138
but I do know that,

1063
00:38:10.138 --> 00:38:12.705
you know, the way I learned,

1064
00:38:12.705 --> 00:38:14.132
the way I lived my childhood

1065
00:38:14.132 --> 00:38:16.156
could never be recreated.

1066
00:38:16.156 --> 00:38:19.393
It's special for those years,

1067
00:38:19.393 --> 00:38:21.073
where my grandma was around,

1068
00:38:21.073 --> 00:38:23.519
and my dad was around.

1069
00:38:23.519 --> 00:38:24.610
When my children grow up,

1070
00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:28.035
I have no idea how long my dad will be around,

1071
00:38:28.035 --> 00:38:30.560
and whether he'll see me or Jose

1072
00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.280
as often as I saw my parents,

1073
00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.915
but I will enjoy him as much as I can.

1074
00:38:36.915 --> 00:38:38.572
<v Voiceover>What's the most important thing you feel,</v>

1075
00:38:38.572 --> 00:38:39.917
as a parent,

1076
00:38:39.917 --> 00:38:42.408
that you can pass onto your children now?

1077
00:38:42.408 --> 00:38:44.566
<v ->My love.</v>

1078
00:38:44.566 --> 00:38:46.270
Absolutely my love.

1079
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:49.609
And, learning to be authentic.

1080
00:38:49.609 --> 00:38:51.383
But the problem in this,

1081
00:38:51.383 --> 00:38:53.982
is that once they reach

1082
00:38:53.982 --> 00:38:56.124
that stage where they want to be accepted,

1083
00:38:56.124 --> 00:38:57.802
not by me or my wife,

1084
00:38:57.802 --> 00:38:59.497
but by their peers,

1085
00:38:59.497 --> 00:39:01.170
it'll be interesting.

1086
00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:02.578
And,

1087
00:39:02.578 --> 00:39:04.664
that's when I have to learn to let go,

1088
00:39:04.664 --> 00:39:06.314
like any parent.

1089
00:39:06.314 --> 00:39:08.060
They have to learn to let go,

1090
00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:08.972
of course,

1091
00:39:08.972 --> 00:39:10.696
I have to be ready,

1092
00:39:10.696 --> 00:39:12.567
of course there has to be rules in the home,

1093
00:39:12.567 --> 00:39:15.933
of course they have to follow

1094
00:39:15.933 --> 00:39:18.140
a guideline.

1095
00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:20.775
But outside of that,

1096
00:39:20.775 --> 00:39:21.991
I have to learn

1097
00:39:21.991 --> 00:39:23.726
that they are going to learn

1098
00:39:23.726 --> 00:39:25.828
from their friends.

1099
00:39:25.828 --> 00:39:27.604
And the only thing I

1100
00:39:27.604 --> 00:39:28.903
want to do,

1101
00:39:28.903 --> 00:39:31.164
is to teach them to learn,

1102
00:39:31.164 --> 00:39:32.592
don't believe me,

1103
00:39:32.592 --> 00:39:33.748
don't believe yourself,

1104
00:39:33.748 --> 00:39:35.013
and don't believe them,

1105
00:39:35.013 --> 00:39:37.465
but learn to listen.

1106
00:39:37.465 --> 00:39:39.505
If I can get that,

1107
00:39:39.505 --> 00:39:41.512
that would be great.

1108
00:39:41.512 --> 00:39:44.473
But, like any dance,

1109
00:39:44.473 --> 00:39:46.749
it takes two to tango.

1110
00:39:46.749 --> 00:39:49.077
And so it requires my son

1111
00:39:49.077 --> 00:39:52.887
to believe, or to listen.

1112
00:39:52.887 --> 00:39:54.165
Or you can say,

1113
00:39:54.165 --> 00:39:55.366
to be willing.

1114
00:39:55.366 --> 00:39:58.280
And my daughter, too, of course.

1115
00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.145
And that's gonna be interesting,

1116
00:39:59.145 --> 00:40:02.042
because she's the first girl in my family for a long time.

1117
00:40:02.042 --> 00:40:02.978
(laughs)

1118
00:40:02.978 --> 00:40:04.705
<v Voiceover>I'm sure she's going to have</v>

1119
00:40:04.705 --> 00:40:07.185
a very special life and on that note,

1120
00:40:07.185 --> 00:40:09.402
thank you so much for taking the time,

1121
00:40:09.402 --> 00:40:10.694
I know that you, your

1122
00:40:10.694 --> 00:40:12.487
voice was already a little bit hoarse

1123
00:40:12.487 --> 00:40:14.069
from having taught this afternoon,

1124
00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:16.177
and I appreciate the time that you've given us.

1125
00:40:16.177 --> 00:40:16.994
<v ->Oh no worries, I'm,</v>

1126
00:40:16.994 --> 00:40:18.152
I'm very thankful for this opportunity.

1127
00:40:18.152 --> 00:40:19.685
<v Voiceover>Well, people were very affected by you,</v>

1128
00:40:19.685 --> 00:40:22.220
you have a very beautiful countenance and,

1129
00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:25.337
it's born out of the fact you've actually been living this,

1130
00:40:25.337 --> 00:40:26.484
these aren't just words,

1131
00:40:26.484 --> 00:40:27.838
it's not just your father's work,

1132
00:40:27.838 --> 00:40:30.180
you and your father teach together now.

1133
00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:30.781
<v ->Yes.</v>

1134
00:40:30.781 --> 00:40:32.293
<v Voiceover>And you're carrying the knowledge forward.</v>

1135
00:40:32.293 --> 00:40:32.970
<v ->Yes.</v>

1136
00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:33.859
<v Voiceover>You are this generation,</v>

1137
00:40:33.859 --> 00:40:35.094
and I'm sure your little girl and boy

1138
00:40:35.094 --> 00:40:36.179
will be doing the same work.

1139
00:40:36.179 --> 00:40:37.443
<v ->Thank you, thank you.</v>

1140
00:40:37.443 --> 00:40:39.303
And my brother, Jose,

1141
00:40:39.303 --> 00:40:41.313
my brother, Leo, and myself

1142
00:40:41.313 --> 00:40:45.040
will do our best this little girl and this little boy.

1143
00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.030
<v Voiceover>Carry this forward,</v>

1144
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:47.121
in the family together.

1145
00:40:47.121 --> 00:40:47.831
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1146
00:40:47.831 --> 00:40:48.960
Because it's not gonna end.

1147
00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.127
(soft music)

1148
00:40:51.127 --> 00:40:52.816
<v ->For more of the Ruiz family's work,</v>

1149
00:40:52.816 --> 00:40:55.441
go to their website at MiguelRuiz.com,

1150
00:40:55.441 --> 00:40:57.515
and find a list of the classes being taught

1151
00:40:57.515 --> 00:40:59.166
by the elder and younger men,

1152
00:40:59.166 --> 00:41:01.633
as well as journey's to Mexico's Toltec site,

1153
00:41:01.633 --> 00:41:03.691
and Ruiz Sr.'s books.

1154
00:41:03.691 --> 00:41:04.707
Until next time,

1155
00:41:04.707 --> 00:41:06.724
thank you for watching CMN.

1156
00:41:06.724 --> 00:41:11.717
