00:00:02.337 --> 00:00:04.310
<v ->Jean Shinoda Bolen is telling the world</v>

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.476
that it's time for the women to gather

3
00:00:06.476 --> 00:00:09.729
in an effort to begin genuine global peace dialogue.

4
00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:11.425
With women at the table,

5
00:00:11.425 --> 00:00:14.443
healing and healthy compromise are possible.

6
00:00:14.443 --> 00:00:16.555
This is, in part, because the female brain

7
00:00:16.555 --> 00:00:18.336
is wired more for diplomacy

8
00:00:18.336 --> 00:00:21.195
and moving between creative and logical processes,

9
00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:23.541
which is required in finding solutions.

10
00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:25.092
As a professor of psychiatry

11
00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:27.342
at the University of San Francisco,

12
00:00:27.342 --> 00:00:30.382
her prestigious career as a feminine cultural leader

13
00:00:30.382 --> 00:00:32.398
has inspired many women to begin

14
00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:34.744
gathering in circles around the world,

15
00:00:34.744 --> 00:00:36.238
and to make their presence known

16
00:00:36.238 --> 00:00:38.157
in political arenas and board rooms

17
00:00:38.157 --> 00:00:40.579
to create a more compassionate and mature

18
00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.109
species through conscious parenting.

19
00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:47.828 line:15% 
(peaceful music)

20
00:00:48.164 --> 00:00:51.586
<v Voiceover>Let's go back in time into Grecian history</v>

21
00:00:51.586 --> 00:00:53.508
to something that we know, really,

22
00:00:53.508 --> 00:00:56.185
very little about called the Eleusinian Mystery.

23
00:00:56.185 --> 00:00:59.620
Having a background in mythology and psychology

24
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.870
and understanding the roots of mythology

25
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.886
and their affect on today's world,

26
00:01:03.886 --> 00:01:06.653
can you tell us a little bit about that?

27
00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.627
<v ->Imagine, for 2,500 years,</v>

28
00:01:11.677 --> 00:01:15.428
the mystery religion, from which the word mystic comes,

29
00:01:15.428 --> 00:01:20.072
was a trinity of the feminine,

30
00:01:20.327 --> 00:01:22.958
and it was the same story as the Easter story.

31
00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.296
That the divine daughter was abducted

32
00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:30.667
into the realm of death, and came back.

33
00:01:31.537 --> 00:01:36.390
The spiritual experience of the initiates

34
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.993
was that they shared the journey of the divine daughter,

35
00:01:38.993 --> 00:01:41.958
and did not have to fear death.

36
00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.166
<v Voiceover>Interesting, this was personified</v>

37
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:45.627
by Persephone, right?

38
00:01:45.627 --> 00:01:49.093
<v ->Right, Persephone, who returns in the spring, abducted;</v>

39
00:01:49.093 --> 00:01:52.667
it's that annual celebratory experience of

40
00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:55.056
winter followed by spring,

41
00:01:55.056 --> 00:01:59.631
and the whole pattern of the planet

42
00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:03.060
being something that we live out ourselves.

43
00:02:03.418 --> 00:02:06.202
So, there was an overlap between Christianity

44
00:02:06.202 --> 00:02:08.644
and the Eleusinian mysteries that,

45
00:02:08.644 --> 00:02:13.644
like, one or two of the church fathers were initiates

46
00:02:15.247 --> 00:02:17.774
because the Eleusinian mysteries did not end

47
00:02:17.774 --> 00:02:22.056
until it was destroyed by the Visigoth in 340 AD.

48
00:02:22.256 --> 00:02:27.256
So there was an overlap, and it was interesting that

49
00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:31.215
at a time when mythology was patriarchal,

50
00:02:31.215 --> 00:02:33.466
that is, Zeus ruled over everything,

51
00:02:33.466 --> 00:02:38.466
the spiritual experience of the Greek people involved

52
00:02:39.407 --> 00:02:44.407
the goddess of the grey and the great mother for Greece,

53
00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:47.769
which was Demeter,

54
00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.014
and her abducted daughter, Persephone.

55
00:02:52.014 --> 00:02:56.579
In the story, there's also a key figure called Hecate,

56
00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.429
so it was a trinity of maiden, mother, crone.

57
00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:02.914
<v Voiceover>Maiden, mother and crone.</v>

58
00:03:02.914 --> 00:03:05.378
So, that was the trinity prior to

59
00:03:05.378 --> 00:03:08.226
the introduction of Christianity.

60
00:03:08.226 --> 00:03:11.021
<v ->It absolutely was; there was a time when</v>

61
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:15.127
people worshipped and revered the great goddess.

62
00:03:15.127 --> 00:03:17.495
<v Voiceover>For the life-giving properties,</v>

63
00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:19.820
obviously, and the cycle of renewal.

64
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.395
<v ->Right, birth-giving, nurturing,</v>

65
00:03:23.175 --> 00:03:26.540
womb and tomb, actually, because we,

66
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.140
everything emerges out of the earth,

67
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.872
then goes back to earth.

68
00:03:29.872 --> 00:03:33.616
<v Voiceover>So, where have we come,</v>

69
00:03:33.616 --> 00:03:38.616
from the time when these mythological remembrances,

70
00:03:39.003 --> 00:03:43.760
passed down traditions had a very large impact on society,

71
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.842
to, let's just jump forward a couple thousand years

72
00:03:46.842 --> 00:03:48.453
to where we are right now.

73
00:03:48.453 --> 00:03:50.564
We'll just kind of get to it.

74
00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:53.860
What has happened to us as a species by

75
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.075
no longer having these same types

76
00:03:57.075 --> 00:03:59.940
of nurturing traditions, oral traditions?

77
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.597
<v ->Well, we've completely lost balance</v>

78
00:04:01.597 --> 00:04:03.336
between masculine and feminine.

79
00:04:03.336 --> 00:04:06.194
The feminine, the divine feminine, the sacred feminine,

80
00:04:06.194 --> 00:04:11.194
the idea that women are carriers of divinity as well as men,

81
00:04:11.346 --> 00:04:14.450
got totally suppressed, and stories such as

82
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.616
the grail that got hidden in the underworld,

83
00:04:17.616 --> 00:04:18.938
well, hidden in the forest,

84
00:04:18.938 --> 00:04:22.053
is a metaphor for the hidden feminine

85
00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:24.495
that could heal the patriarchy,

86
00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:26.234
which is a wounded future king.

87
00:04:26.234 --> 00:04:28.497
So, we've arrived at a time in history

88
00:04:28.497 --> 00:04:32.292
where there could be a turning point.

89
00:04:32.292 --> 00:04:34.521
If we continue in the direction we're going,

90
00:04:34.521 --> 00:04:36.398
we will use up the planet,

91
00:04:36.398 --> 00:04:40.821
and the opportunity to evolve and to become

92
00:04:41.551 --> 00:04:46.008
who we are actually capable of becoming as human beings

93
00:04:46.008 --> 00:04:47.608
will be lost.

94
00:04:47.608 --> 00:04:50.371
I think we have, maybe only a window of opportunity

95
00:04:50.371 --> 00:04:53.763
of several decades in which the feminine

96
00:04:53.763 --> 00:04:57.607
could actually come into the world and make a difference.

97
00:04:57.978 --> 00:05:00.506
The reason I say that is because

98
00:05:00.506 --> 00:05:02.554
there is a generation of women

99
00:05:02.554 --> 00:05:05.221
that has never existed before on this planet.

100
00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:07.236
<v Voiceover>Could you elaborate on that?</v>

101
00:05:07.236 --> 00:05:10.543
<v ->Well, ever since the late '60's and '70's,</v>

102
00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:14.809
we've had, first of all, in numbers in the United States,

103
00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:17.039
it's a baby boomer generation.

104
00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:20.132
So, at this present time, women over 50,

105
00:05:20.132 --> 00:05:23.054
who have been educated, who have had

106
00:05:23.054 --> 00:05:25.283
positions of responsibility, who've had choices

107
00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:28.323
about birth control, who have chosen

108
00:05:28.323 --> 00:05:30.552
what spiritual traditions they might follow,

109
00:05:30.552 --> 00:05:34.520
and who have networked, loved, cared for each other,

110
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.059
and for the first time, had a sense

111
00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:39.426
that to be a woman is a good thing.

112
00:05:39.426 --> 00:05:42.797
Here we are with all the fundamentalists

113
00:05:42.797 --> 00:05:47.202
of the patriarchal religions wanting us to go back to--

114
00:05:47.202 --> 00:05:49.133
<v Voiceover>Barefoot and pregnant.</v>

115
00:05:49.133 --> 00:05:51.362
<v ->Or burka-ized, or something like that.</v>

116
00:05:51.362 --> 00:05:52.524
(laughter)

117
00:05:52.524 --> 00:05:55.095
So, the influence that we can have

118
00:05:55.095 --> 00:05:58.977
will exist only for the next couple of decades.

119
00:05:58.977 --> 00:06:02.806
And, I'm personally feeling

120
00:06:02.806 --> 00:06:06.358
myself and others as being, sort of message carriers.

121
00:06:06.358 --> 00:06:09.963
Urgent Message From Mother is talking about

122
00:06:09.963 --> 00:06:12.907
mother earth, the maternal instinct, the sacred feminine,

123
00:06:12.907 --> 00:06:16.693
that is recognizing that it is women

124
00:06:16.693 --> 00:06:18.944
that could make a difference and change the world.

125
00:06:18.944 --> 00:06:21.706
That it's not up to the men, but it's up to women

126
00:06:21.706 --> 00:06:24.917
to bring the feminine principle into balance.

127
00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:27.462
<v Voiceover>And yet, there is so much</v>

128
00:06:27.462 --> 00:06:31.216
conflicting pressure on society.

129
00:06:31.216 --> 00:06:33.616
Some things that just pop to mind,

130
00:06:33.616 --> 00:06:36.240
and I know this could become tangential here,

131
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.371
but that's okay,

132
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:41.648
is that women now, as a result of some of,

133
00:06:41.648 --> 00:06:44.154
as you say, the freedoms and educations and such

134
00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:45.573
that we have now,

135
00:06:45.573 --> 00:06:47.407
there's another thing running along side it,

136
00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:51.471
i.e. Lara Croft, and that is that women are now

137
00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:54.554
participating much more in, say, violent acts,

138
00:06:54.554 --> 00:06:56.036
and being arrested much more

139
00:06:56.036 --> 00:06:57.476
than they ever were in history,

140
00:06:57.476 --> 00:06:59.801
in this area of trying to find the power.

141
00:06:59.801 --> 00:07:01.636
Also, at the same time, you have women

142
00:07:01.636 --> 00:07:05.817
that are 13 years old starving themselves

143
00:07:05.817 --> 00:07:10.817
trying to be some ideal that doesn't exist in nature.

144
00:07:11.064 --> 00:07:12.366
(laughter)

145
00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:15.363
And so then you have the self-loathing of women

146
00:07:15.363 --> 00:07:18.211
that go along with that: body imagery, all these

147
00:07:18.211 --> 00:07:21.027
conflicting things happening at this incredible time,

148
00:07:21.027 --> 00:07:23.554
can you just comment on all this a bit?

149
00:07:23.554 --> 00:07:27.362
<v ->Well, there's always been a layer of self-loathing</v>

150
00:07:27.362 --> 00:07:32.362
because to be a woman is to be an inferior human being

151
00:07:32.567 --> 00:07:35.788
in the way of old tradition.

152
00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:39.457
So, that's, the form it takes may be different now,

153
00:07:39.457 --> 00:07:43.596
but the sort of depreciation of one's own gender

154
00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:48.097
has been ever since patriarchy, basically.

155
00:07:50.537 --> 00:07:53.441
When women were not allowed to be educated,

156
00:07:53.441 --> 00:07:55.883
didn't vote, didn't do a number of things,

157
00:07:55.883 --> 00:07:58.571
they, obviously, appeared to be inferior.

158
00:07:58.571 --> 00:08:03.571
So, the inferior, feeling inferior is nothing new.

159
00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:06.823
Now, what is new is that the emergence,

160
00:08:06.823 --> 00:08:09.586
one, of women with a sister archetype,

161
00:08:09.586 --> 00:08:11.761
the bonding, the feminist movement.

162
00:08:11.761 --> 00:08:16.188
The sense of the positive element of the maternal

163
00:08:17.398 --> 00:08:21.223
so that what we have now

164
00:08:21.223 --> 00:08:23.964
is not all women or all men,

165
00:08:23.964 --> 00:08:26.844
we're, there's an individuality among the gender,

166
00:08:26.844 --> 00:08:30.076
for one thing, so that, though I'm talking about

167
00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:33.393
it's up to women, it's up to men and women

168
00:08:33.393 --> 00:08:36.742
that have a bond to the feminine principle,

169
00:08:36.742 --> 00:08:40.667
and therefore feel an interdependency of life,

170
00:08:40.667 --> 00:08:43.441
and a realization that unless we

171
00:08:43.441 --> 00:08:45.499
tap into that interdependency and look out

172
00:08:45.499 --> 00:08:48.240
for the planet, for each other,

173
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.357
that the inevitable war that will be a

174
00:08:52.357 --> 00:08:55.536
nuclear winter disaster, or we'll just use up the planet,

175
00:08:55.536 --> 00:08:59.045
and with nuclear warming and with overpopulation,

176
00:08:59.045 --> 00:09:02.170
we'll just do in our resources, so there's all of that

177
00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:06.469
going on, clearly, that we are at a time when

178
00:09:06.469 --> 00:09:09.092
the tipping point experience could happen.

179
00:09:09.092 --> 00:09:13.369
Now, because you and I have been through

180
00:09:13.369 --> 00:09:15.065
the women's movement experience

181
00:09:15.065 --> 00:09:16.665
and seen the influence,

182
00:09:16.665 --> 00:09:18.756
well, it was just women meeting together

183
00:09:18.756 --> 00:09:20.889
in small consciousness raising groups.

184
00:09:20.889 --> 00:09:23.929
It wasn't a orchestrated from the tops thing at all.

185
00:09:23.929 --> 00:09:27.043
It had to do with tapping into,

186
00:09:27.043 --> 00:09:29.294
we can either call it the morphic field phenomenon,

187
00:09:29.294 --> 00:09:33.773
or we can look at Malcolm Gladwell and look at tipping point

188
00:09:33.773 --> 00:09:36.397
but when a critical mass of people change

189
00:09:36.397 --> 00:09:38.563
how they think, how they feel,

190
00:09:38.563 --> 00:09:42.178
what was either repressed or unthinkable

191
00:09:42.178 --> 00:09:45.293
or condemned from the pulpit becomes the new norm.

192
00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:48.845
And that happens amazingly rapidly

193
00:09:48.845 --> 00:09:50.860
when the tipping point occurs.

194
00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:51.863
There was that saying,

195
00:09:51.863 --> 00:09:53.516
"There's nothing so powerful as an idea

196
00:09:53.516 --> 00:09:54.807
"whose time has come."

197
00:09:54.807 --> 00:09:56.204
<v Jean>It's true.</v>
<v Voiceover>Has it come?</v>

198
00:09:56.204 --> 00:09:58.359
<v ->Not yet, but it's moving.</v>

199
00:09:58.359 --> 00:09:59.843
<v Voiceover>I'm not seeing it because the women</v>

200
00:09:59.843 --> 00:10:02.041
in Congress are acting a lot like the men in a lot of cases.

201
00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:03.182
<v ->Well, they have to.</v>

202
00:10:03.182 --> 00:10:04.270
<v Voiceover>That's true.</v>
<v Jean>Up until,</v>

203
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.873
they have to until there is a critical number,

204
00:10:06.873 --> 00:10:11.011
and the United Nations number would be

205
00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:13.539
that you have to have at least 30% of the Parliament

206
00:10:13.539 --> 00:10:18.531
women before women start to voice and stand for,

207
00:10:18.531 --> 00:10:23.218
like, education and maternal care and things like that.

208
00:10:23.701 --> 00:10:25.808
Up until that point, women have to

209
00:10:25.808 --> 00:10:28.485
look and be on the committees that have power,

210
00:10:28.485 --> 00:10:30.991
so they're, in order to be respected.

211
00:10:30.991 --> 00:10:32.357
<v Voiceover>They have to play ball just to be there.</v>

212
00:10:32.357 --> 00:10:34.884
<v ->Right, so we have something,</v>

213
00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:39.475
as I recall, we have something like 14% of our Congress,

214
00:10:39.475 --> 00:10:43.123
Senators and House, women.

215
00:10:43.123 --> 00:10:45.896
There are at least 16 countries where women

216
00:10:45.896 --> 00:10:49.885
do have over 30%, and one of the,

217
00:10:49.885 --> 00:10:52.392
the one that has more than any other

218
00:10:52.392 --> 00:10:55.698
<v Jean>is Rwanda.</v>
<v Voiceover>Interesting.</v>

219
00:10:55.698 --> 00:11:00.033
<v ->43% women, and it's women together.</v>

220
00:11:00.295 --> 00:11:03.985
Now, after 800,000 people were massacred

221
00:11:03.985 --> 00:11:06.524
in a short period of time,

222
00:11:06.524 --> 00:11:10.662
and there were orphanages just filled with children,

223
00:11:10.662 --> 00:11:12.656
it was women getting together,

224
00:11:12.656 --> 00:11:14.777
reconciling with the situation,

225
00:11:14.777 --> 00:11:17.433
and deciding out of their maternal instinct

226
00:11:17.433 --> 00:11:21.433
that they needed to adopt with no consideration

227
00:11:21.433 --> 00:11:24.003
whether they were Tutsi children or Hutu children.

228
00:11:24.003 --> 00:11:25.240
<v Voiceover>That's so beautiful.</v>

229
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.368
<v ->And so, it had to do with what women,</v>

230
00:11:29.368 --> 00:11:32.035
as a gender have physiologically,

231
00:11:32.035 --> 00:11:36.024
and that is, one, an ability to

232
00:11:37.705 --> 00:11:41.139
physiologically be the more empathic gender,

233
00:11:41.139 --> 00:11:45.363
has to do with how, when stress occurs,

234
00:11:45.363 --> 00:11:48.915
men, as a gender, go to flight or fight,

235
00:11:48.915 --> 00:11:50.846
and ever since the research that was done

236
00:11:50.846 --> 00:11:55.272
at UCLA in 1991, we know that women tend,

237
00:11:55.272 --> 00:11:58.898
when stressed, to want to talk to the other women

238
00:11:58.898 --> 00:12:01.682
closest to them, and that when they do,

239
00:12:01.682 --> 00:12:03.335
the stress level goes down,

240
00:12:03.335 --> 00:12:05.351
and the maternal bonding hormone,

241
00:12:05.351 --> 00:12:07.538
called Oxytocin, goes up.

242
00:12:07.538 --> 00:12:11.015
So essentially, if there's ever to be peace

243
00:12:11.015 --> 00:12:12.647
negotiated well in this world,

244
00:12:12.647 --> 00:12:14.737
women have to be at the table.

245
00:12:14.737 --> 00:12:17.244
And the United Nations has recognized it.

246
00:12:17.244 --> 00:12:22.244
That with UN resolution 1325, which is referred to as,

247
00:12:23.654 --> 00:12:26.022
"the women, peace and security resolution."

248
00:12:26.022 --> 00:12:29.435
It says wherever conflict is in the works,

249
00:12:29.435 --> 00:12:33.008
or happening or after, women need to be involved,

250
00:12:33.008 --> 00:12:36.859
and we don't impose it on the major conflicts.

251
00:12:36.859 --> 00:12:39.418
I mean, you look at the Middle East,

252
00:12:39.418 --> 00:12:42.522
you don't see women involved in the peace process.

253
00:12:42.522 --> 00:12:45.381
But, when it's imposed, it's interesting,

254
00:12:45.381 --> 00:12:47.493
because it was imposed on Sierra Leone,

255
00:12:47.493 --> 00:12:51.460
and I was at the commission on the status of women

256
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.828
when the women from that area were commenting

257
00:12:53.828 --> 00:12:55.581
about what it was like.

258
00:12:56.461 --> 00:12:59.385
One of the war lords was just incensed.

259
00:12:59.385 --> 00:13:01.220
He said, "What do we need the women for.

260
00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.773
"You know what they would do; they would just compromise."

261
00:13:03.773 --> 00:13:06.233
And, we all went, "Duh!"

262
00:13:06.233 --> 00:13:07.513
(laughter)

263
00:13:07.513 --> 00:13:09.881
How else can we make peace?

264
00:13:09.881 --> 00:13:11.320
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

265
00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.222
<v ->Yet, if compromise is considered weakness,</v>

266
00:13:14.222 --> 00:13:19.222
and you've got testosterone and adrenaline,

267
00:13:19.277 --> 00:13:21.393
and you've got alpha males at the top

268
00:13:21.393 --> 00:13:23.953
feeling that if there's any compromise,

269
00:13:23.953 --> 00:13:25.767
it's a loss of face, and it's a loss--

270
00:13:25.767 --> 00:13:27.761
<v Voiceover>A matter of pride.</v>

271
00:13:27.761 --> 00:13:29.734
<v ->That's no way to negotiate peace.</v>

272
00:13:29.734 --> 00:13:32.102
<v Voiceover>Right, there is little room for pride</v>

273
00:13:32.102 --> 00:13:35.419
in that sense, at the peace table.

274
00:13:35.419 --> 00:13:37.254
<v ->And, we need to look after the so-called</v>

275
00:13:37.254 --> 00:13:39.024
collateral damage, which happens to be

276
00:13:39.024 --> 00:13:40.902
women and children, usually.

277
00:13:40.902 --> 00:13:44.688
And who better to represent women and children,

278
00:13:44.688 --> 00:13:47.568
but women who care about women and children.

279
00:13:47.568 --> 00:13:48.869
<v Voiceover>Right, I mean this is really,</v>

280
00:13:48.869 --> 00:13:50.704
this is fundamental to the process.

281
00:13:50.704 --> 00:13:53.391
It's also fundamental, from what I have understood

282
00:13:53.391 --> 00:13:57.715
from one particular clinical study on the subject of

283
00:13:57.715 --> 00:13:59.773
brain chemistry and the production of

284
00:13:59.773 --> 00:14:02.056
the feel-good chemical, serotonin, in the brain,

285
00:14:02.056 --> 00:14:04.530
that classically speaking, and it doesn't matter

286
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.922
which country we're from, women have roughly

287
00:14:07.922 --> 00:14:12.625
10 to 12 points lower an amount of percentage points

288
00:14:12.625 --> 00:14:15.932
of serotonin in their lives, which also has to do with

289
00:14:15.932 --> 00:14:19.228
comfort eating, which, those carbohydrates create

290
00:14:19.228 --> 00:14:22.203
the flow of serotonin, the creation of serotonin,

291
00:14:22.203 --> 00:14:25.382
to feel better, and so it seems to me,

292
00:14:25.382 --> 00:14:27.846
on a really fundamental level, we have to,

293
00:14:27.846 --> 00:14:30.021
in this process, find ways, as women

294
00:14:30.021 --> 00:14:32.485
to begin bringing that sense of empowerment

295
00:14:32.485 --> 00:14:35.408
up to where we can simply function normally,

296
00:14:35.408 --> 00:14:38.661
even on just an equal brain chemistry level.

297
00:14:38.661 --> 00:14:40.144
Do you know what I mean?

298
00:14:40.144 --> 00:14:43.557
<v ->Well, actually, women have more fibers</v>

299
00:14:43.557 --> 00:14:45.114
between the right and left brain

300
00:14:45.114 --> 00:14:46.607
than men as a gender do as adults.

301
00:14:46.607 --> 00:14:47.599
<v Voiceover>Yes, I've read that.</v>

302
00:14:47.599 --> 00:14:51.428
<v ->But, if women, especially maternal women</v>

303
00:14:51.428 --> 00:14:56.428
were able to have children raised differently,

304
00:14:56.452 --> 00:14:59.022
then boys would grow up differently as well,

305
00:14:59.022 --> 00:15:01.529
and that would make a tremendous difference.

306
00:15:01.529 --> 00:15:03.225
<v Voiceover>So, how do you see childrearing</v>

307
00:15:03.225 --> 00:15:05.987
in this age where we have to reach that tipping point

308
00:15:05.987 --> 00:15:08.078
when women are part of the work force,

309
00:15:08.078 --> 00:15:11.214
and at the same time, there are other women

310
00:15:11.214 --> 00:15:13.859
who are also there in daycare to help raise children.

311
00:15:13.859 --> 00:15:15.885
How do you see that?

312
00:15:15.885 --> 00:15:17.816
<v ->Well, first of all, I really,</v>

313
00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:21.197
I think from the very beginning that women

314
00:15:21.197 --> 00:15:23.682
need to have reproductive choice.

315
00:15:23.682 --> 00:15:27.981
That not all women are biologically excited about,

316
00:15:27.981 --> 00:15:30.562
well, not all women are naturally maternal, for one thing.

317
00:15:30.562 --> 00:15:32.418
<v Voiceover>Yes, that's very true.</v>

318
00:15:32.418 --> 00:15:34.231
<v ->And, lots of women are.</v>

319
00:15:34.231 --> 00:15:38.753
And, to have, whenever women

320
00:15:38.753 --> 00:15:43.137
have the right to reproduction, a choice,

321
00:15:43.137 --> 00:15:45.462
the population of the planet would,

322
00:15:45.462 --> 00:15:47.787
first of all, we'd affect the population of the planet

323
00:15:47.787 --> 00:15:51.318
because what happens is that women have fewer children,

324
00:15:51.318 --> 00:15:53.430
and they're healthier, and the women are healthier,

325
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:55.637
and people are happier, and all of that.

326
00:15:55.637 --> 00:15:56.587
<v Voiceover>And less stress.</v>

327
00:15:56.587 --> 00:15:57.909
<v ->And less stress.</v>

328
00:15:57.909 --> 00:16:02.250
And so, I think that there is something to be said for,

329
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.144
well, for one thing, I think there's

330
00:16:07.144 --> 00:16:11.741
a need to bring more joy into the life of everybody,

331
00:16:11.741 --> 00:16:13.266
and I think that children these days

332
00:16:13.266 --> 00:16:17.959
are being overly scheduled, and overly competitive,

333
00:16:17.959 --> 00:16:20.626
and overly afraid, at least in this country,

334
00:16:20.626 --> 00:16:24.881
and it's amazing how many, the percentage

335
00:16:24.881 --> 00:16:27.761
of children now that have learning disabilities.

336
00:16:27.761 --> 00:16:31.430
We're not doing something well.

337
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:32.657
<v Voiceover>Well, number one,</v>

338
00:16:32.657 --> 00:16:34.353
they have no fresh-air playtime,

339
00:16:34.353 --> 00:16:37.446
you know, scheduled with one lesson after another,

340
00:16:37.446 --> 00:16:40.347
and then, you know, go on to your gymnastics lesson.

341
00:16:40.347 --> 00:16:42.342
I couldn't agree more with you.

342
00:16:42.342 --> 00:16:45.360
<v ->Remember, there was a book title, years ago,</v>

343
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.200
it was: What Did You Do? Nothing.

344
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.311
Where Did You Go? Nothing.

345
00:16:50.311 --> 00:16:53.681
It was basically about a kid being free

346
00:16:53.681 --> 00:16:57.350
and safe enough to spend an afternoon after school

347
00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:02.350
doing nothing productive, but being out in nature,

348
00:17:02.833 --> 00:17:05.478
and being with friends and hanging out.

349
00:17:07.138 --> 00:17:08.944
<v Voiceover>That's what my youth was like!</v>

350
00:17:08.944 --> 00:17:11.927
(laughter)

351
00:17:11.927 --> 00:17:16.858
<v ->And somehow, there's an acceleration</v>

352
00:17:16.858 --> 00:17:19.380
of stress all around.

353
00:17:20.238 --> 00:17:22.072
<v Voiceover>And this demand for more,</v>

354
00:17:22.072 --> 00:17:24.184
for more doing-ness.

355
00:17:24.184 --> 00:17:27.800
<v ->Well, it also has to do with a political system</v>

356
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.125
and a religious system that is getting

357
00:17:30.125 --> 00:17:32.866
increasingly driven by fear.

358
00:17:32.866 --> 00:17:34.861
<v Voiceover>Right, big point.</v>

359
00:17:34.861 --> 00:17:38.967
<v ->You know, the basis of all the major religions,</v>

360
00:17:38.967 --> 00:17:43.967
in its greater evolution has been towards love:

361
00:17:44.311 --> 00:17:47.372
love one another, forgive each other, etc.

362
00:17:47.372 --> 00:17:51.671
Well, somehow, that message is getting totally reconfigured.

363
00:17:55.041 --> 00:17:57.974
And whenever you start to respond out of fear,

364
00:17:57.974 --> 00:18:00.502
as a country or as a human being,

365
00:18:00.502 --> 00:18:05.210
you become smaller in the soul level.

366
00:18:06.262 --> 00:18:11.262
I think that the possibility for people to start,

367
00:18:11.573 --> 00:18:15.829
first of all, meeting one another in depth.

368
00:18:15.829 --> 00:18:17.237
One of the things I've been doing is

369
00:18:17.237 --> 00:18:20.842
feeling like I seed circle to the spiritual center,

370
00:18:20.842 --> 00:18:24.394
that in our busy lives, when do we have time

371
00:18:24.394 --> 00:18:29.226
to really meet deeply, and include silence as part of it?

372
00:18:29.226 --> 00:18:33.641
I mean, if you have four or five friends, good friends,

373
00:18:33.641 --> 00:18:38.185
how do you spend any quality time with each other?

374
00:18:38.185 --> 00:18:40.212
But if, every other week or something,

375
00:18:40.212 --> 00:18:42.385
you meet for a couple of hours together

376
00:18:42.385 --> 00:18:44.774
and you check in and you know what's

377
00:18:44.774 --> 00:18:46.448
happening with each other,

378
00:18:46.448 --> 00:18:49.115
and there's a space for meditation or prayer,

379
00:18:49.115 --> 00:18:51.067
and you can also keep up with each other

380
00:18:51.067 --> 00:18:54.064
on internet now, men and women

381
00:18:54.064 --> 00:18:57.520
are meeting in circles that have the sacred dimension,

382
00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.632
and they're deepening, which is that the soul

383
00:18:59.632 --> 00:19:01.840
is expanding and trusting more,

384
00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.840
and it is a form that goes back, pre-patriarchal,

385
00:19:07.642 --> 00:19:10.479
it goes to summer camp around campfires.

386
00:19:10.479 --> 00:19:13.241
It is, it doesn't cost anything,

387
00:19:13.241 --> 00:19:16.356
you don't need a paid facilitator to do it,

388
00:19:16.356 --> 00:19:19.054
and there is a wisdom that comes out in it.

389
00:19:19.054 --> 00:19:21.241
One of the things that I'm really feeling

390
00:19:21.241 --> 00:19:24.739
and having fun doing is exactly that,

391
00:19:24.739 --> 00:19:26.905
is seeding the idea of circles.

392
00:19:26.905 --> 00:19:28.483
So I wrote The Millionth Circle,

393
00:19:28.483 --> 00:19:30.616
with the notion that the millionth circle

394
00:19:30.616 --> 00:19:33.006
would be like the hundredth monkey metaphor,

395
00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:35.032
that it was the tipping point:

396
00:19:35.032 --> 00:19:37.144
that when enough people have had the experience

397
00:19:37.144 --> 00:19:40.621
of spiritual connectedness with one another,

398
00:19:40.621 --> 00:19:45.621
communication at a depth level, and trust, that

399
00:19:46.007 --> 00:19:51.007
that could tip the field, and so,

400
00:19:51.031 --> 00:19:53.164
instead of being fear driven, it might be possible

401
00:19:53.164 --> 00:19:55.468
for people to say, "Wait a minute.

402
00:19:55.468 --> 00:19:57.644
"We need to have a balance of men and women,

403
00:19:57.644 --> 00:19:59.751
"male and female.

404
00:19:59.751 --> 00:20:02.294
"We need to not be so afraid of each other.

405
00:20:02.294 --> 00:20:05.313
"We need to have a sense of that

406
00:20:05.313 --> 00:20:08.587
"spirituality unites humanity."

407
00:20:08.587 --> 00:20:11.051
There's something archetypal about us as humans,

408
00:20:11.051 --> 00:20:14.155
that from the time people made

409
00:20:14.155 --> 00:20:18.229
those amazing paintings in caves 48,000 years ago,

410
00:20:18.229 --> 00:20:21.344
we've had an ability to have awe.

411
00:20:21.344 --> 00:20:24.853
This makes us different, probably, than other

412
00:20:24.853 --> 00:20:28.074
living elements on this planet.

413
00:20:28.074 --> 00:20:31.530
And the whole notion that we were given the choice

414
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:36.530
to know good and evil means that we are responsible,

415
00:20:36.596 --> 00:20:41.289
like no other species, for how we evolve and what we do.

416
00:20:41.289 --> 00:20:42.889
<v Voiceover>And what's happened lately, it seems,</v>

417
00:20:42.889 --> 00:20:45.790
is we've, well, throughout history is, we blur those lines.

418
00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.372
We redefine what good and evil is: us against them.

419
00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:50.270
Xenophobic thinking.

420
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:53.822
<v ->We project, all of us have good and evil in us.</v>

421
00:20:53.822 --> 00:20:57.907
And, often the decision about whether we

422
00:20:57.907 --> 00:21:00.584
love or forgive or act out of fear

423
00:21:00.584 --> 00:21:03.272
has to do with projecting our negativity

424
00:21:03.272 --> 00:21:05.970
onto the enemy, which is the other.

425
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.456
It doesn't work.

426
00:21:08.456 --> 00:21:10.120
<v Voiceover>No, it doesn't work, and this problem,</v>

427
00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.821
I mean, as we're speaking primarily about women,

428
00:21:13.821 --> 00:21:17.852
but the problem of fear is extended so deeply into society,

429
00:21:17.852 --> 00:21:20.850
and I was reading an article recently about

430
00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:23.292
a trend in Japan, which is quite interesting,

431
00:21:23.292 --> 00:21:25.543
where they have young men, primarily men,

432
00:21:25.543 --> 00:21:27.697
who are shutting themselves in and refuse

433
00:21:27.697 --> 00:21:30.556
to come out of their rooms because they can't deal

434
00:21:30.556 --> 00:21:34.801
with the load of responsibilities that lie ahead for them.

435
00:21:34.801 --> 00:21:37.712
So they, they're shut-ins.

436
00:21:37.712 --> 00:21:42.587
And they're actually engaging the services of young women

437
00:21:42.587 --> 00:21:46.139
to try to start a conversation with them on the internet,

438
00:21:46.139 --> 00:21:48.645
or anything to re-engage them into life again,

439
00:21:48.645 --> 00:21:50.362
and come out of isolation,

440
00:21:50.362 --> 00:21:53.423
and it takes a lot of tender care

441
00:21:53.423 --> 00:21:55.589
to draw someone out in this situation.

442
00:21:55.589 --> 00:21:57.487
That country has the highest percentage,

443
00:21:57.487 --> 00:21:59.258
but other countries are experiencing this, too,

444
00:21:59.258 --> 00:22:01.572
where their men are frightened to even try

445
00:22:01.572 --> 00:22:04.804
to get out there in this harsh world and make their way.

446
00:22:04.804 --> 00:22:06.959
<v ->We're also talking about people that are depressed.</v>

447
00:22:06.959 --> 00:22:08.175
<v Voiceover>Very depressed, yes.</v>

448
00:22:08.175 --> 00:22:13.175
<v ->We're looking at how addictions are being used</v>

449
00:22:13.529 --> 00:22:17.059
to numb feelings, and basically,

450
00:22:17.059 --> 00:22:19.086
one of the major movements of our time

451
00:22:19.086 --> 00:22:23.730
is the recovery movement, because it's,

452
00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:28.036
with gambling being the latest addiction of many.

453
00:22:28.036 --> 00:22:31.386
What addictions do is shut you down:

454
00:22:31.386 --> 00:22:33.028
you don't know what you feel,

455
00:22:33.028 --> 00:22:36.953
you are benumbed, and it allows you to then

456
00:22:36.953 --> 00:22:39.833
just sort of march.

457
00:22:39.833 --> 00:22:44.782
What's really lost is the sense of meaning

458
00:22:44.782 --> 00:22:48.078
and of joy, and of any kind of depth,

459
00:22:48.078 --> 00:22:51.498
and the number of people

460
00:22:51.498 --> 00:22:55.722
who then repress what they feel

461
00:22:57.352 --> 00:22:59.753
and also the number of people who have

462
00:22:59.753 --> 00:23:02.932
been traumatized in this world is enormous.

463
00:23:02.932 --> 00:23:07.932
There's something about the fragility

464
00:23:08.824 --> 00:23:13.704
and the amazing power to survive that exists in children.

465
00:23:19.194 --> 00:23:21.986
People, when they're little, are traumatized by

466
00:23:21.986 --> 00:23:26.497
things that then affect them into adulthood,

467
00:23:26.497 --> 00:23:29.142
and there's something about a culture

468
00:23:29.142 --> 00:23:31.020
that doesn't look after the children.

469
00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.460
Now, this is what I'm talking about when I think

470
00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.507
Urgent Message From Mother is,

471
00:23:34.507 --> 00:23:38.209
first of all, look after the children.

472
00:23:38.209 --> 00:23:41.760
See that children are not incested and traumatized.

473
00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.331
See that they get decent healthcare.

474
00:23:44.331 --> 00:23:47.659
Let them be educated and not bullied.

475
00:23:47.659 --> 00:23:51.192
You will have people,

476
00:23:51.192 --> 00:23:53.538
from small people to big people

477
00:23:53.538 --> 00:23:55.373
growing up differently,

478
00:23:55.373 --> 00:23:59.415
and so much of what is oppressive about men in power

479
00:23:59.415 --> 00:24:01.900
comes from growing up in a culture

480
00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.004
where they learned very early that

481
00:24:05.004 --> 00:24:07.820
you're either on top or you're on the bottom.

482
00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.857
<v Voiceover>Right, that is true.</v>

483
00:24:09.857 --> 00:24:11.212
And now, women are beginning to

484
00:24:11.212 --> 00:24:12.929
buy into it and feel the same.

485
00:24:12.929 --> 00:24:15.500
<v ->Absolutely, and what happens is you</v>

486
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.963
lose your capacity to empathize.

487
00:24:17.963 --> 00:24:20.075
So then you have, as we're having

488
00:24:20.075 --> 00:24:24.235
this greater and greater difference

489
00:24:24.235 --> 00:24:25.931
between the haves and the haves-not,

490
00:24:25.931 --> 00:24:28.139
and the have-nots are viewed by the haves

491
00:24:28.139 --> 00:24:30.187
as somehow not like them.

492
00:24:30.187 --> 00:24:31.211
<v Voiceover>And wouldn't that be</v>

493
00:24:31.211 --> 00:24:32.832
why the rise in gambling?

494
00:24:32.832 --> 00:24:34.432
As people fear having less,

495
00:24:34.432 --> 00:24:35.829
they're willing to take greater

496
00:24:35.829 --> 00:24:38.634
and more crazy risks to have?

497
00:24:38.634 --> 00:24:40.863
<v ->And it's also a high when you are winning.</v>

498
00:24:40.863 --> 00:24:42.581
<v Voiceover>Yes, right, high when you're winning,</v>

499
00:24:42.581 --> 00:24:44.020
but usually, you're losing,

500
00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.674
but there's a feeling as though

501
00:24:45.674 --> 00:24:48.084
there's not enough, and the risk is worth it.

502
00:24:48.084 --> 00:24:50.217
Then it numbs you out even further.

503
00:24:50.217 --> 00:24:52.340
<v ->That's true, that's for sure.</v>

504
00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.492
<v Voiceover>It's kind of crazy.</v>

505
00:24:53.492 --> 00:24:55.284
But let's look at value systems within

506
00:24:55.284 --> 00:24:58.462
the subject you're most passionate about right now,

507
00:24:58.462 --> 00:25:00.830
which is calling the women together

508
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:04.019
because of the urgent message from mother earth

509
00:25:04.019 --> 00:25:05.736
for us to help heal the earth.

510
00:25:05.736 --> 00:25:08.030
What are some of the values that have to change,

511
00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:11.443
societally across the board, throughout all cultures?

512
00:25:11.443 --> 00:25:13.469
<v ->First, that we're all related to one another,</v>

513
00:25:13.469 --> 00:25:15.042
and that what,

514
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:20.248
that it matters what happens on the other side of the world

515
00:25:20.248 --> 00:25:22.691
to the rainforests or to the people,

516
00:25:22.691 --> 00:25:26.008
that if you don't care for other people's children,

517
00:25:26.008 --> 00:25:29.308
it's going to come back to you.

518
00:25:30.349 --> 00:25:32.252
Excuse me.

519
00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:40.321
And, it seems so obvious

520
00:25:40.321 --> 00:25:45.015
that we should be spending our considerable

521
00:25:45.015 --> 00:25:48.396
riches and budget on better things

522
00:25:48.396 --> 00:25:52.769
than the military industrial greed complex.

523
00:25:52.769 --> 00:25:54.113
<v Voiceover>Amen.</v>

524
00:25:54.113 --> 00:25:56.299
(laughter)

525
00:25:56.299 --> 00:26:01.070
<v ->Yet, the priorities are just all messed up.</v>

526
00:26:01.641 --> 00:26:05.929
I think there is something to be said for,

527
00:26:05.929 --> 00:26:08.328
like EMILY's List said that

528
00:26:11.118 --> 00:26:16.118
it is a political pact that supports

529
00:26:16.691 --> 00:26:20.178
democratic women who are running for things.

530
00:26:20.178 --> 00:26:23.921
I think that, while some women can certainly be

531
00:26:23.921 --> 00:26:26.940
as power oriented as men are supposed to be,

532
00:26:31.206 --> 00:26:35.921
actually what's interesting is that the leaders

533
00:26:35.921 --> 00:26:39.291
who carry the feminine principle,

534
00:26:39.291 --> 00:26:41.307
which is about interconnectedness

535
00:26:41.307 --> 00:26:43.451
and about looking after the vulnerable,

536
00:26:43.451 --> 00:26:47.323
have been notable men.

537
00:26:47.323 --> 00:26:49.690
Nelson Mandela, who comes out of being in prison

538
00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:51.664
and could play avenge really well,

539
00:26:51.664 --> 00:26:52.944
he could have turned the ANC

540
00:26:52.944 --> 00:26:55.695
on all of the whites in South Africa.

541
00:26:55.695 --> 00:26:59.343
He could have created a devastation, and he didn't.

542
00:26:59.343 --> 00:27:02.703
The Dalai Lama, carrier of compassion.

543
00:27:02.703 --> 00:27:06.585
There's something about the combination

544
00:27:06.585 --> 00:27:10.852
of men who have stepped out of the pattern of hierarchy,

545
00:27:10.852 --> 00:27:14.180
and women whose maternal instinct

546
00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.473
and concern for the children

547
00:27:16.473 --> 00:27:19.651
makes them aware that it doesn't really matter

548
00:27:19.651 --> 00:27:23.694
if it's my son or daughter, or yours,

549
00:27:23.694 --> 00:27:26.947
we're going to be equally devastated

550
00:27:26.947 --> 00:27:28.941
if they're killed in a stupid war.

551
00:27:28.941 --> 00:27:30.477
<v Voiceover>That's right.</v>

552
00:27:30.477 --> 00:27:32.984
<v ->The initial Mother's Day proclamation</v>

553
00:27:32.984 --> 00:27:37.367
was to bring the mothers of the world together for peace.

554
00:27:38.577 --> 00:27:42.678
<v Voiceover>At this time, where we're marching</v>

555
00:27:42.678 --> 00:27:44.368
toward the tipping point,

556
00:27:44.368 --> 00:27:45.669
<v ->Hopefully.</v>

557
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:47.024
<v Voiceover>And these beautiful and gentle men</v>

558
00:27:47.024 --> 00:27:49.946
are assisting in this process by encouraging this

559
00:27:49.946 --> 00:27:53.915
sense of community, often,

560
00:27:53.915 --> 00:27:57.935
a greater polarization also seems to occur at that time

561
00:27:57.935 --> 00:28:00.405
to try to squelch change because the species

562
00:28:00.405 --> 00:28:02.816
seems to resist change.

563
00:28:02.816 --> 00:28:05.354
<v ->It's been interesting, very interesting historically,</v>

564
00:28:05.354 --> 00:28:09.205
that just before things change, there is a real repression.

565
00:28:09.205 --> 00:28:11.338
It's like hand wrestling, you know.

566
00:28:11.338 --> 00:28:15.754
It's like this, and then there's a real push,

567
00:28:15.754 --> 00:28:17.823
and then it tips, and when it tips,

568
00:28:17.823 --> 00:28:20.329
it's like there's a new era.

569
00:28:20.329 --> 00:28:25.044
That we go from the age of faith,

570
00:28:25.044 --> 00:28:27.828
as it got more and more corrupted, into the Reformation,

571
00:28:27.828 --> 00:28:31.678
or we went from the Medieval Times to the Renaissance.

572
00:28:31.678 --> 00:28:33.982
There's a point in which

573
00:28:33.982 --> 00:28:36.136
something is rising up to the grassroots,

574
00:28:36.136 --> 00:28:38.227
and then it tips.

575
00:28:38.227 --> 00:28:39.848
<v Voiceover>Where are we in that continuum,</v>

576
00:28:39.848 --> 00:28:41.661
because it seems like we're experiencing

577
00:28:41.661 --> 00:28:45.469
a bit of the repression right now, attempted repression?

578
00:28:45.469 --> 00:28:47.912
<v ->Well, the fundamentalists of all of the major religions</v>

579
00:28:47.912 --> 00:28:51.442
have the apparent upper hand,

580
00:28:51.442 --> 00:28:56.442
but there's an awful lot of energy in the others

581
00:28:57.479 --> 00:29:01.095
who are saying, "Wait a minute, this was not the message

582
00:29:01.095 --> 00:29:03.953
"of our religion."

583
00:29:03.953 --> 00:29:08.953
And, the grassroots are usually quite quiet

584
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:13.819
until there reaches a point where something shifts it.

585
00:29:13.819 --> 00:29:15.355
<v Voiceover>How do you perceive</v>

586
00:29:15.355 --> 00:29:16.891
that shifting point right now,

587
00:29:16.891 --> 00:29:19.739
with the apparent repression on one hand,

588
00:29:19.739 --> 00:29:23.088
and yet, the quiet masses that are not sleeping,

589
00:29:23.088 --> 00:29:24.528
that are waking up?

590
00:29:24.528 --> 00:29:27.077
<v ->Because I'm one of the message carriers,</v>

591
00:29:27.077 --> 00:29:30.725
and when I articulate that it's up to women

592
00:29:30.725 --> 00:29:34.373
in great numbers, and we're 52% of the world's population,

593
00:29:36.023 --> 00:29:39.294
and I get a sense that I'm putting words

594
00:29:39.294 --> 00:29:42.077
to the feeling that is emerging in the psyche of people,

595
00:29:42.077 --> 00:29:45.213
I get a feeling that the morphic field is active,

596
00:29:45.213 --> 00:29:47.645
and that very close to the surface,

597
00:29:47.645 --> 00:29:49.896
coming at individuals, because that's how it works.

598
00:29:49.896 --> 00:29:51.965
You think you have an original idea,

599
00:29:51.965 --> 00:29:54.610
but, and it is original to you,

600
00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:56.797
but it so happens that the collective psyche

601
00:29:56.797 --> 00:30:00.882
is rising with the same idea,

602
00:30:00.882 --> 00:30:04.039
and so, you give it, I give it a different form

603
00:30:04.039 --> 00:30:05.948
that's uniquely our own form,

604
00:30:05.948 --> 00:30:08.966
and it comes to us as an original idea.

605
00:30:08.966 --> 00:30:10.513
But then, we look around and we say,

606
00:30:10.513 --> 00:30:12.241
<v Voiceover>It's everywhere!</v>

607
00:30:12.241 --> 00:30:14.001
<v ->It is really coming up everywhere!</v>

608
00:30:14.001 --> 00:30:15.419
<v Voiceover>Very true, and there have been</v>

609
00:30:15.419 --> 00:30:17.734
clinical experiments proving the power of the masses,

610
00:30:17.734 --> 00:30:20.118
and the correctness of decisions that are made

611
00:30:20.118 --> 00:30:22.603
when it genuinely comes from the mass consciousness.

612
00:30:22.603 --> 00:30:24.043
So you're seeing that we are

613
00:30:24.043 --> 00:30:26.347
getting toward that tipping point?

614
00:30:26.347 --> 00:30:27.989
<v ->I'm thinking we are.</v>

615
00:30:27.989 --> 00:30:31.594
<v Voiceover>Just give us, in your opinion,</v>

616
00:30:31.594 --> 00:30:34.559
a few things that need to be done now;

617
00:30:34.559 --> 00:30:37.493
the sense of the urgent message from mother earth,

618
00:30:37.493 --> 00:30:41.066
that need to happen now among people of the planet,

619
00:30:41.066 --> 00:30:44.042
women and men, in order to facilitate

620
00:30:44.042 --> 00:30:47.561
this tipping point and this, hopefully, saving grace.

621
00:30:47.561 --> 00:30:50.836
<v ->Well, first of all, one of the things</v>

622
00:30:50.836 --> 00:30:54.462
that could really help it to move even faster

623
00:30:54.462 --> 00:30:58.878
is if there would be a fifth United Nations

624
00:30:58.878 --> 00:31:00.872
Women World conference.

625
00:31:00.872 --> 00:31:03.656
The last one was in Beijing in 1995.

626
00:31:03.656 --> 00:31:06.045
There were 50,000 people who went to this

627
00:31:06.045 --> 00:31:08.552
conference in Beijing.

628
00:31:08.552 --> 00:31:10.248
It was hard to get to and all of that,

629
00:31:10.248 --> 00:31:12.808
and out of it came a document called,

630
00:31:12.808 --> 00:31:14.269
"the platform for action,"

631
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:19.015
which, if implemented, would bring women and men

632
00:31:19.015 --> 00:31:22.034
into a balanced kind of conscious society

633
00:31:22.034 --> 00:31:25.948
in that it would raise and overcome

634
00:31:25.948 --> 00:31:29.617
the oppression that women, globally, are experiencing.

635
00:31:29.617 --> 00:31:33.062
So, we thought back in those days

636
00:31:33.062 --> 00:31:35.388
that since there had been four in a row,

637
00:31:35.388 --> 00:31:38.097
that by 2005--

638
00:31:38.097 --> 00:31:40.305
<v Voiceover>Might have been another one.</v>

639
00:31:40.305 --> 00:31:41.137
(laughter)

640
00:31:41.137 --> 00:31:42.907
<v ->And then, for me to find out with others</v>

641
00:31:42.907 --> 00:31:45.926
that it's not happening; it's not gonna happen

642
00:31:45.926 --> 00:31:48.315
unless there's enough grassroots energy

643
00:31:48.315 --> 00:31:50.821
to influence our respective countries,

644
00:31:50.821 --> 00:31:53.125
and to influence the United Nations to have one,

645
00:31:53.125 --> 00:31:57.349
and it would be the first one since the internet and emails.

646
00:31:57.349 --> 00:32:01.338
Can you imagine how it could be to have 300,000 women--

647
00:32:01.338 --> 00:32:02.597
<v Voiceover>That could gain some traction.</v>

648
00:32:02.597 --> 00:32:05.732
<v ->Coming to a conference in a place like Canada for example?</v>

649
00:32:05.732 --> 00:32:07.450
Which happens to be a place that I'm

650
00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:10.441
energizingly trying to involve.

651
00:32:12.115 --> 00:32:17.115
To have those websites up and emails going beforehand,

652
00:32:18.841 --> 00:32:21.369
meeting, getting inspired, learning from each other

653
00:32:21.369 --> 00:32:22.904
what's possible, who does what,

654
00:32:22.904 --> 00:32:24.344
because basically, it's always,

655
00:32:24.344 --> 00:32:27.619
"Well, if he or she could do that, I could do that, too."

656
00:32:27.619 --> 00:32:29.304
You know, this is possible.

657
00:32:29.304 --> 00:32:32.440
And then, you get mentors and you get inspired,

658
00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.181
and then you get follow-ups afterwards with emails.

659
00:32:35.181 --> 00:32:38.082
Can you imagine how fast something would move?

660
00:32:38.082 --> 00:32:40.941
So I'm out there thinking that this is something

661
00:32:42.881 --> 00:32:44.684
that needs to be done.

662
00:32:44.684 --> 00:32:49.122
And I'm thinking that that would be easy enough,

663
00:32:49.122 --> 00:32:51.031
that shouldn't take too much.

664
00:32:51.031 --> 00:32:54.273
You can go on the internet and download a petition

665
00:32:54.273 --> 00:32:59.273
on www, 5wwc.org, for example.

666
00:33:02.177 --> 00:33:05.945
And then, there are all of the connections

667
00:33:05.945 --> 00:33:08.260
that are happening between and among circles.

668
00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:13.260
On the interface side, there's United Religious Initiative,

669
00:33:13.582 --> 00:33:18.200
there's The Millionth Circle, there's GatherTheWomen.org.

670
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:23.320
Again, this is speaking to there is something rising

671
00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:27.821
in that direction, so I think that is a very good sign.

672
00:33:27.821 --> 00:33:31.789
I think that, hopefully, the elections in the next

673
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:36.789
congressional elections will show that the American people

674
00:33:36.834 --> 00:33:40.311
are no longer going along with war as an answer.

675
00:33:40.311 --> 00:33:41.964
<v Jean>We'll see.</v>
<v Voiceover>Let's hope.</v>

676
00:33:41.964 --> 00:33:43.628
<v ->Let's hope, let's see.</v>

677
00:33:43.628 --> 00:33:46.902
And then, the signs, because right now,

678
00:33:46.902 --> 00:33:51.457
it's more like an intuitive read of what is happening.

679
00:33:51.457 --> 00:33:53.366
<v Voiceover>But you have your ear to the ground,</v>

680
00:33:53.366 --> 00:33:54.731
you're out there.

681
00:33:54.731 --> 00:33:56.960
<v ->And it feels good.</v>

682
00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:01.952
I'm also trying to recruit people, but women especially,

683
00:34:01.952 --> 00:34:06.389
and people in their retirement age, we retire earlier.

684
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:11.389
At 55, well, you might have 40 good years left!

685
00:34:11.616 --> 00:34:13.258
What are you going to do after, you know,

686
00:34:13.258 --> 00:34:15.509
you've already done the traveling to this or that,

687
00:34:15.509 --> 00:34:18.484
and you've meditated long enough.

688
00:34:18.484 --> 00:34:21.919
How about doing something to make a difference now

689
00:34:21.919 --> 00:34:24.617
because it's meaningful and fun?

690
00:34:24.617 --> 00:34:29.044
I have been exporting an idea that really has been

691
00:34:29.044 --> 00:34:33.022
my own notion about what keeps me moving,

692
00:34:33.022 --> 00:34:35.219
because I'm invited to do a number of things,

693
00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:38.174
and how do I decide?

694
00:34:38.174 --> 00:34:42.675
I started to think, well, one, I obviously have to be

695
00:34:42.675 --> 00:34:47.187
open to having the energy to do a next thing,

696
00:34:47.187 --> 00:34:51.709
but given that, I have three criteria.

697
00:34:51.709 --> 00:34:54.493
One is, is it meaningful?

698
00:34:54.493 --> 00:34:58.098
Well, a great many things that we are offered

699
00:34:58.098 --> 00:35:00.583
as possibilities fit that description.

700
00:35:00.583 --> 00:35:02.759
The second is, is it fun?

701
00:35:02.759 --> 00:35:04.924
And fun has to do with the people

702
00:35:04.924 --> 00:35:08.241
that do this thing that you might join.

703
00:35:08.241 --> 00:35:12.348
People that you can laugh with,

704
00:35:12.348 --> 00:35:14.257
people that you can be honest with,

705
00:35:14.257 --> 00:35:17.691
people that it feels like together you do more

706
00:35:17.691 --> 00:35:20.038
than if you did by yourself.

707
00:35:20.038 --> 00:35:23.056
The third criteria has to do with,

708
00:35:23.056 --> 00:35:26.608
is this whole undertaking motivated by love?

709
00:35:26.608 --> 00:35:29.296
It includes outraged love,

710
00:35:29.296 --> 00:35:31.781
because you can be outraged becuase you love the planet,

711
00:35:31.781 --> 00:35:33.598
or you love children, or you love trees,

712
00:35:33.598 --> 00:35:36.105
and you're watching what's being done

713
00:35:36.105 --> 00:35:39.827
and though there is an outraged energy,

714
00:35:39.827 --> 00:35:41.470
it's not done out of hate, it's out of--

715
00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:42.776
<v Voiceover>Passion.</v>

716
00:35:42.776 --> 00:35:45.075
<v ->It's out of the love for whatever it is</v>

717
00:35:45.075 --> 00:35:47.048
that you want to save.

718
00:35:47.048 --> 00:35:48.093
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

719
00:35:48.093 --> 00:35:53.085
<v ->I think if people would take these three criteria to heart</v>

720
00:35:53.085 --> 00:35:57.981
with the notion that, if you're still here,

721
00:35:57.981 --> 00:36:01.554
life has prepared you, with all your resources

722
00:36:01.554 --> 00:36:05.244
and your intelligence and the ability to look at your life

723
00:36:05.244 --> 00:36:10.244
and say, "Compared to 95% of people on this planet,

724
00:36:10.364 --> 00:36:13.873
"I've really been given a lot.

725
00:36:13.873 --> 00:36:17.052
"Might it now be time to give back?"

726
00:36:17.052 --> 00:36:20.859
When you start giving back, it's a great energy!

727
00:36:20.859 --> 00:36:23.718
There's something that has come out, for example,

728
00:36:23.718 --> 00:36:26.320
with the people who go into long term remissions

729
00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.080
with cancer that could have killed them,

730
00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.128
or should have killed them, statistically,

731
00:36:30.128 --> 00:36:35.128
and invariably, part of what they're doing is altruistic.

732
00:36:35.749 --> 00:36:38.373
It is in some way giving back.

733
00:36:38.373 --> 00:36:41.061
It is being an activist in some personal way,

734
00:36:41.061 --> 00:36:43.567
in which they're getting a lot of juice

735
00:36:43.567 --> 00:36:45.679
out of helping some other people.

736
00:36:45.679 --> 00:36:47.930
<v Voiceover>Dr. Lorraine Day, who we also interviewed,</v>

737
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:49.903
said that's a really critical part in healing.

738
00:36:49.903 --> 00:36:51.535
<v ->I'm sure it is.</v>

739
00:36:51.535 --> 00:36:54.361
Again, it's meaningful,

740
00:36:54.361 --> 00:36:55.876
(laughter)

741
00:36:55.876 --> 00:36:57.337
<v ->[Voiceover and Jean] Meaningful, fun,</v>

742
00:36:57.337 --> 00:36:58.756
and motivated by love.

743
00:36:58.756 --> 00:37:01.166
<v Voiceover>That sounds like a perfect criteria</v>

744
00:37:01.166 --> 00:37:02.766
for almost anything we do in life,

745
00:37:02.766 --> 00:37:06.318
and certainly helping the earth recover itself

746
00:37:06.318 --> 00:37:08.110
has got to be the best--

747
00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:10.414
<v ->Well see, the other thing is that only you can say</v>

748
00:37:10.414 --> 00:37:12.451
what these three things are.

749
00:37:12.451 --> 00:37:14.755
It's not other people saying it's meaningful.

750
00:37:14.755 --> 00:37:17.378
You're saying, "This is meaningful to me."

751
00:37:17.378 --> 00:37:22.274
Nobody can define who and what you do

752
00:37:22.274 --> 00:37:24.973
being fun, except yourself.

753
00:37:24.973 --> 00:37:29.282
And, whether or not you're motivated to do something

754
00:37:29.282 --> 00:37:31.906
because you love what you're doing or helping,

755
00:37:31.906 --> 00:37:36.906
again, it's all part of the authentic being that you are,

756
00:37:36.951 --> 00:37:39.041
and this is where I bring in

757
00:37:39.041 --> 00:37:41.782
the second half of life work as a Jungian analyst,

758
00:37:41.782 --> 00:37:44.897
is it's, Jung called it individuation.

759
00:37:44.897 --> 00:37:49.897
But it has to do with being the person that you could be

760
00:37:50.283 --> 00:37:52.790
based on the difficulties and the talents

761
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:54.997
that you have gone through in the first half of life,

762
00:37:54.997 --> 00:37:56.523
the lessons you've learned,

763
00:37:56.523 --> 00:38:00.352
and now it's time to really have an individual life.

764
00:38:00.352 --> 00:38:04.469
We try to meet the expectations of family and culture

765
00:38:04.469 --> 00:38:05.973
in the first half of life.

766
00:38:05.973 --> 00:38:08.714
It has to do, usually, with relationship and career,

767
00:38:08.714 --> 00:38:12.628
and we either succeed or we don't to meet the

768
00:38:12.628 --> 00:38:16.756
general sense of this is what a competent adult manages.

769
00:38:16.756 --> 00:38:18.388
Then what?

770
00:38:18.388 --> 00:38:22.142
The next part of life is about us individually,

771
00:38:22.142 --> 00:38:24.137
what we came to do.

772
00:38:24.137 --> 00:38:28.233
I have thought so often about how everybody says

773
00:38:28.233 --> 00:38:30.803
and feels that they have a soul.

774
00:38:30.803 --> 00:38:33.128
Well, it's very curious, then.

775
00:38:33.128 --> 00:38:35.635
Because if we all have a sense of having a soul,

776
00:38:35.635 --> 00:38:40.115
then we're spiritual beings who've come into this

777
00:38:40.115 --> 00:38:43.250
strange experience called human life.

778
00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:44.573
(laughter)

779
00:38:44.573 --> 00:38:49.245
So, to reframe it, we're spiritual beings on a human path,

780
00:38:49.245 --> 00:38:50.845
rather than human beings who may

781
00:38:50.845 --> 00:38:53.564
or may not be on a spiritual path, okay?

782
00:38:53.564 --> 00:38:58.564
Then, there is, well, there must be something

783
00:38:58.951 --> 00:39:03.951
about an immortal soul that in this human experience

784
00:39:05.169 --> 00:39:09.809
can grow or not, or experience things or not,

785
00:39:09.809 --> 00:39:13.355
that even an immortal soul does not.

786
00:39:13.969 --> 00:39:16.315
I think it's about vulnerability and love,

787
00:39:16.315 --> 00:39:18.288
and it's about choices we make.

788
00:39:20.998 --> 00:39:24.069
Only we can determine such things as,

789
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:27.791
and often, only as we're living life,

790
00:39:27.791 --> 00:39:29.668
what did we really come to do?

791
00:39:29.668 --> 00:39:30.895
<v Voiceover>The big question,</v>

792
00:39:30.895 --> 00:39:33.199
it's a question in many of us, now.

793
00:39:33.199 --> 00:39:35.865
<v ->Who did we really, or what did we really come to love?</v>

794
00:39:35.865 --> 00:39:37.838
And what are we here for?

795
00:39:40.718 --> 00:39:43.481
When you're doing something with your life

796
00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:48.481
that feels real and is using your life,

797
00:39:49.262 --> 00:39:51.544
what you knew through your suffering,

798
00:39:51.544 --> 00:39:53.379
and what you knew through your talents,

799
00:39:53.379 --> 00:39:57.112
your whole self is present, doing what you're doing,

800
00:39:57.112 --> 00:39:59.202
and it is quite delicious.

801
00:39:59.202 --> 00:40:04.202
I really think that, instead of so many of the things

802
00:40:04.567 --> 00:40:07.565
that people think is going to make them happy

803
00:40:07.565 --> 00:40:10.135
when they retire, that everybody should do that

804
00:40:10.135 --> 00:40:13.186
for a little while, but then they should heed a call

805
00:40:13.186 --> 00:40:14.988
to really make a difference.

806
00:40:14.988 --> 00:40:19.585
Because I think that if we're here and of this generation

807
00:40:19.585 --> 00:40:21.729
that could make a difference to this planet,

808
00:40:21.729 --> 00:40:25.275
that there's a purpose that we happen to be here right now.

809
00:40:25.718 --> 00:40:29.538 line:15% 
(peaceful music)

810
00:40:29.538 --> 00:40:32.983 line:15% 
<v ->I didn't even really know what a women's circle was.</v>

811
00:40:32.983 --> 00:40:35.116
I just knew I wanted to bring women together,

812
00:40:35.116 --> 00:40:37.495
and if we did it in the container of a circle,

813
00:40:37.495 --> 00:40:41.441
that somehow, it would be a magical formula,

814
00:40:41.441 --> 00:40:43.905
and indeed, it did serve to be so.

815
00:40:43.905 --> 00:40:45.462
A lot of the women in that first circle

816
00:40:45.462 --> 00:40:48.108
set their intention for their dream lives,

817
00:40:48.108 --> 00:40:50.454
and the things that have unfolded.

818
00:40:50.454 --> 00:40:51.798
It was amazing.

819
00:40:51.798 --> 00:40:53.771
Soon after I did that first circle,

820
00:40:53.771 --> 00:40:56.118
all of a sudden, people started giving me these books

821
00:40:56.118 --> 00:40:58.027
that were about creating women's circles,

822
00:40:58.027 --> 00:40:59.467
and The Millionth Circle,

823
00:40:59.467 --> 00:41:03.531
and creating women's spirituality circles,

824
00:41:03.531 --> 00:41:06.154
and all of these books, and I looked to see

825
00:41:06.154 --> 00:41:07.594
when they were published,

826
00:41:07.594 --> 00:41:10.464
and it was the same year that I got the nudge

827
00:41:10.464 --> 00:41:12.447
to start my own women's circle.

828
00:41:12.447 --> 00:41:14.346
It was at that time I realized,

829
00:41:14.346 --> 00:41:16.202
"Oh my god, I believe that I'm,

830
00:41:16.202 --> 00:41:18.708
"I know I'm a part of something much bigger

831
00:41:18.708 --> 00:41:21.130
"than I can even imagine."

832
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:22.473
<v Voiceover>When you come together,</v>

833
00:41:22.473 --> 00:41:25.492
is it for purpose, or is it really

834
00:41:25.492 --> 00:41:28.969
to go into a quiet space and see what reveals itself?

835
00:41:28.969 --> 00:41:30.484
<v ->Good question.</v>

836
00:41:30.484 --> 00:41:32.382
There's a lot of different types of circles.

837
00:41:32.382 --> 00:41:36.265
Usually when I'm introducing what women's circles are about

838
00:41:36.265 --> 00:41:40.350
I say there's sewing circles, and Bible study groups,

839
00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:43.251
and book groups and all of that,

840
00:41:43.251 --> 00:41:45.640
and they're done, conducted in a circle,

841
00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.592
and one person is speaking at a time,

842
00:41:47.592 --> 00:41:50.920
that's one of the principles of circling.

843
00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.938
So, there's a lot of different types,

844
00:41:53.938 --> 00:41:57.042
but what really drew me was to almost do

845
00:41:57.042 --> 00:41:59.719
like a prayer circle, in a way,

846
00:41:59.719 --> 00:42:02.876
just create a space, a sacred space,

847
00:42:02.876 --> 00:42:05.756
where women could be still for a moment,

848
00:42:05.756 --> 00:42:07.985
and be still with each other.

849
00:42:07.985 --> 00:42:09.606
Have a collective,

850
00:42:09.606 --> 00:42:12.529
that where two or more are gathered feeling

851
00:42:12.529 --> 00:42:15.153
and power happen.

852
00:42:15.153 --> 00:42:18.011
There's always a first feasting,

853
00:42:18.011 --> 00:42:19.729
and I think that's very important

854
00:42:19.729 --> 00:42:22.790
for women to be fed with each other,

855
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:24.699
so I always feel like the circle kind of starts

856
00:42:24.699 --> 00:42:26.704
during that feasting time,

857
00:42:26.704 --> 00:42:29.541
and then the calling of the circle,

858
00:42:29.541 --> 00:42:32.698
which can be done with a beautiful tone,

859
00:42:32.698 --> 00:42:34.789
or just starting music.

860
00:42:34.789 --> 00:42:37.007
I use these Tibetan bells, and it's amazing

861
00:42:37.007 --> 00:42:39.749
how that seems to get everyone's attention

862
00:42:39.749 --> 00:42:41.327
and give them that sense of

863
00:42:41.327 --> 00:42:43.727
something really special's about to happen,

864
00:42:43.727 --> 00:42:45.626
and everyone gets quiet.

865
00:42:45.626 --> 00:42:46.884
Then, what I've been doing,

866
00:42:46.884 --> 00:42:49.369
what I call the sphere-circle formula,

867
00:42:49.369 --> 00:42:50.831
is exactly what I've been talking about:

868
00:42:50.831 --> 00:42:53.006
first the feasting, then the calling of the circle,

869
00:42:53.006 --> 00:42:57.657
and then, I create kind of a guided meditation,

870
00:42:57.657 --> 00:43:00.675
creating the actual container of the circle

871
00:43:00.675 --> 00:43:04.739
with a light that comes out of everyone's heart

872
00:43:04.739 --> 00:43:07.619
that streams around and connects everyone's arms.

873
00:43:07.619 --> 00:43:09.954
I don't really have people holding hands,

874
00:43:09.954 --> 00:43:13.357
it's more just having our hands placed out,

875
00:43:13.357 --> 00:43:16.621
and everyone who's experienced it really has,

876
00:43:16.621 --> 00:43:19.639
the feedback has been that they really feel that light

877
00:43:19.639 --> 00:43:23.597
coming around and that container being created.

878
00:43:23.597 --> 00:43:25.196
<v Voiceover>How many people do you normally</v>

879
00:43:25.196 --> 00:43:26.540
have in a circle?

880
00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.258
<v ->Well, it depends.</v>

881
00:43:28.258 --> 00:43:31.969
I have had for seven years an ongoing group

882
00:43:31.969 --> 00:43:34.551
of personal friends, select friends,

883
00:43:34.551 --> 00:43:37.590
which is really highly suggested in doing a circle,

884
00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:42.590
is to really be discerning about who you invite in

885
00:43:42.699 --> 00:43:45.696
because the safe space is very important,

886
00:43:45.696 --> 00:43:49.504
so I would say about 10 to 12 to 15

887
00:43:49.504 --> 00:43:51.125
was kind of the average.

888
00:43:51.125 --> 00:43:52.917
Then when I did my larger circle,

889
00:43:52.917 --> 00:43:54.560
because I found that there were so many women

890
00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:58.346
that wanted this and I wanted to provide that space

891
00:43:58.346 --> 00:44:01.898
so I did ongoing monthly circles that were open,

892
00:44:01.898 --> 00:44:05.087
but I still kind of screened people before they came in,

893
00:44:05.087 --> 00:44:08.010
and that would be up to, the largest circle

894
00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:10.495
was 48 women, but in general,

895
00:44:10.495 --> 00:44:12.863
it would be around 20, 20 women.

896
00:44:12.863 --> 00:44:17.342
The sharing, it's one of the important things

897
00:44:17.342 --> 00:44:19.924
in a circle is for each woman's voice

898
00:44:19.924 --> 00:44:21.566
to somehow be heard.

899
00:44:21.566 --> 00:44:24.745
With this beginning opening ritual that I created,

900
00:44:24.745 --> 00:44:28.414
I call it the candle lighting affirming ritual,

901
00:44:28.414 --> 00:44:31.603
each woman, one at a time, lights a candle saying,

902
00:44:31.603 --> 00:44:35.219
"I am the," and then you use some kind of adjective

903
00:44:35.219 --> 00:44:38.451
to describe who you are, such as prosperous,

904
00:44:38.451 --> 00:44:43.325
succulent, calm, confident, free-flowing Deborah,

905
00:44:43.325 --> 00:44:46.066
and then the whole circle will say,

906
00:44:46.066 --> 00:44:48.114
"We hold that for you, Deborah."

907
00:44:48.114 --> 00:44:50.855
And then the next woman lights her candle off of me,

908
00:44:50.855 --> 00:44:53.362
and it goes around, and there's just,

909
00:44:53.362 --> 00:44:55.409
some women start crying because of

910
00:44:55.409 --> 00:44:58.897
the moving experience of just holding light

911
00:44:58.897 --> 00:45:02.748
and being listened to and being able to say the, "I am."

912
00:45:02.748 --> 00:45:06.022
It's very powerful, and to have that held for you

913
00:45:06.022 --> 00:45:08.860
with all these open hearts.

914
00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:12.155
<v Voiceover>Your circles no longer contain just women.</v>

915
00:45:12.155 --> 00:45:13.339
Is that correct?

916
00:45:13.339 --> 00:45:14.267
I mean, you have your girlfriends,

917
00:45:14.267 --> 00:45:16.379
but aren't you expanding the circles

918
00:45:16.379 --> 00:45:20.624
to include men, which I think is really essential.

919
00:45:20.624 --> 00:45:25.019
<v ->Yes, I've found that this formula works for all people,</v>

920
00:45:25.019 --> 00:45:28.293
and the circle principles are important for

921
00:45:28.293 --> 00:45:30.362
all people to experience.

922
00:45:30.362 --> 00:45:35.023
The idea of being heard and being in sacred space,

923
00:45:35.023 --> 00:45:39.364
and having non-judgement, especially of yourself,

924
00:45:39.364 --> 00:45:42.831
and the speaking one at a time,

925
00:45:42.831 --> 00:45:47.831
and feeling like whatever you're saying in the circle

926
00:45:48.185 --> 00:45:50.585
is going to stay in the circle.

927
00:45:50.585 --> 00:45:52.558
These are all really important principles

928
00:45:52.558 --> 00:45:54.574
that men are craving, too.

929
00:45:54.574 --> 00:45:56.921
So, I have, I think it's important for women

930
00:45:56.921 --> 00:46:00.216
to still gather solely as women,

931
00:46:00.216 --> 00:46:03.533
however, especially now, expanding into

932
00:46:03.533 --> 00:46:06.371
the inclusion of men and letting them

933
00:46:06.371 --> 00:46:09.197
express their more feminine side,

934
00:46:09.197 --> 00:46:12.898
and encourage that in the sharing of the heart.

935
00:46:12.898 --> 00:46:14.103
<v Voiceover>And encourage the principles</v>

936
00:46:14.103 --> 00:46:16.493
that are classically identified as feminine,

937
00:46:16.493 --> 00:46:18.999
such as nurturing and compassion and caring,

938
00:46:18.999 --> 00:46:21.602
and finding consensus and so forth,

939
00:46:21.602 --> 00:46:24.183
those are the essential elements that are needed

940
00:46:24.183 --> 00:46:28.684
to heal the state we're in politically, ecologically, etc.

941
00:46:28.684 --> 00:46:32.492
It does seem logical that men and women come together

942
00:46:32.492 --> 00:46:35.435
because it is about interconnectedness of all, isn't it?

943
00:46:35.435 --> 00:46:36.417
<v ->Very much.</v>

944
00:46:36.417 --> 00:46:39.339
That's one of my monikers for my magazine,

945
00:46:39.339 --> 00:46:42.720
Spheres Circles Publication is, it's all about connecting

946
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.920
for the benefit of all, and I truly believe,

947
00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.683
and there's been a lot of scientific proof of,

948
00:46:48.683 --> 00:46:50.357
when people come together,

949
00:46:50.357 --> 00:46:55.050
then sending out an energy that is of a positive nature,

950
00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:57.322
and when we come together in circles,

951
00:46:57.322 --> 00:47:00.202
what I've phrased happens is

952
00:47:00.202 --> 00:47:02.708
we create, like pockets of peace,

953
00:47:02.708 --> 00:47:04.660
whether it's just with a single girlfriend

954
00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:08.116
or if you're sitting around a dinner table.

955
00:47:08.116 --> 00:47:10.815
You'll notice the energy shift if it goes from

956
00:47:10.815 --> 00:47:13.780
people just blabbing and having separate conversations

957
00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:17.033
to all of a sudden, bringing it into a single conversation

958
00:47:17.033 --> 00:47:19.475
where one person is speaking at a time.

959
00:47:19.475 --> 00:47:22.046
All of a sudden, there is a sense of sacredness

960
00:47:22.046 --> 00:47:24.904
that is there and people feel like they

961
00:47:24.904 --> 00:47:27.155
don't want to leave that space.

962
00:47:27.155 --> 00:47:29.182
<v Voiceover>We really,</v>

963
00:47:30.252 --> 00:47:32.765
bringing women together so we can express ourselves

964
00:47:32.765 --> 00:47:36.829
and our frustrations even at times,

965
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:40.359
really, the time for getting together and just bitching

966
00:47:40.359 --> 00:47:43.634
is past, this is not something that's really

967
00:47:43.634 --> 00:47:46.204
valuable or needed any more in that sense.

968
00:47:46.204 --> 00:47:48.305
To express how you feel honestly,

969
00:47:48.305 --> 00:47:51.804
but in a much more open context toward healing,

970
00:47:51.804 --> 00:47:54.940
and openness and understanding rather than

971
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:58.011
coming together with your girlfriends and complaining;

972
00:47:58.011 --> 00:48:00.678
complaining about your husband, this sort of thing,

973
00:48:00.678 --> 00:48:01.979
or your kids--

974
00:48:01.979 --> 00:48:04.326
<v ->And that's where creating that sacred space</v>

975
00:48:04.326 --> 00:48:06.640
feeling in a circle is so important

976
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:09.317
because it's almost like you would feel strange

977
00:48:09.317 --> 00:48:12.261
talking in that way in that particular space

978
00:48:12.261 --> 00:48:14.192
when it's created properly.

979
00:48:14.192 --> 00:48:15.216
<v Voiceover>Very true.</v>

980
00:48:15.216 --> 00:48:17.925
Really important to do this; very important at this time,

981
00:48:17.925 --> 00:48:20.719
as both you and Jean have discussed.

982
00:48:20.719 --> 00:48:23.311
How do you go about starting a circle?

983
00:48:23.311 --> 00:48:26.052
<v ->Well, the first thing you want to do is</v>

984
00:48:26.052 --> 00:48:29.188
decide who you would want to share that space with.

985
00:48:29.188 --> 00:48:31.193
That's very important.

986
00:48:31.193 --> 00:48:35.748
So just putting out the word and setting the guidelines for,

987
00:48:35.748 --> 00:48:38.510
I always have on every invitation,

988
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:41.337
whether it's for an event or for the women that have been

989
00:48:41.337 --> 00:48:43.395
coming for seven years, a reminder of what

990
00:48:43.395 --> 00:48:45.464
the guidelines of the circle are,

991
00:48:45.464 --> 00:48:48.707
and really honoring coming on time,

992
00:48:48.707 --> 00:48:50.893
and not getting up and leaving,

993
00:48:50.893 --> 00:48:53.795
and really committing to being present

994
00:48:53.795 --> 00:48:56.738
for that block of time.

995
00:48:56.738 --> 00:48:59.202
The first circle I ever experienced

996
00:48:59.202 --> 00:49:01.410
had been together for nine years,

997
00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:03.959
and these women let no one else in that circle,

998
00:49:03.959 --> 00:49:08.706
and they did not even begin speaking until they felt like it

999
00:49:08.706 --> 00:49:11.372
and I was invited in, and I remember that night

1000
00:49:11.372 --> 00:49:14.625
sitting there and there was, like this long pause,

1001
00:49:14.625 --> 00:49:16.406
and I was tired to begin with, and I thought,

1002
00:49:16.406 --> 00:49:18.636
"Oh my god, this is going to be a long night."

1003
00:49:18.636 --> 00:49:20.865
Finally, I just relaxed into it,

1004
00:49:20.865 --> 00:49:22.913
and all of a sudden a woman lit a candle,

1005
00:49:22.913 --> 00:49:24.630
and she just started talking,

1006
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:27.435
and sometimes she was crying, and sometimes she was laughing

1007
00:49:27.435 --> 00:49:29.686
and I found myself with tears

1008
00:49:29.686 --> 00:49:31.456
streaming down my face with her

1009
00:49:31.456 --> 00:49:34.123
and I found myself laughing with her,

1010
00:49:34.123 --> 00:49:36.331
and all of a sudden, I got that feeling

1011
00:49:36.331 --> 00:49:39.861
of the golden thread that connects us all

1012
00:49:39.861 --> 00:49:43.829
and a sense of being each of these women,

1013
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:46.197
and I felt energized by that.

1014
00:49:46.197 --> 00:49:49.546
It's really important, one of the things

1015
00:49:49.546 --> 00:49:51.498
I learned about that particular circle

1016
00:49:51.498 --> 00:49:54.004
was the benefit of being with women

1017
00:49:54.004 --> 00:49:57.599
that you felt so safe with, and that you could share with.

1018
00:49:57.599 --> 00:50:00.692
I've been doing these open circles strictly so that

1019
00:50:00.692 --> 00:50:03.774
people could experience this particular formula

1020
00:50:03.774 --> 00:50:06.611
and see how easy it is to start your own circle

1021
00:50:06.611 --> 00:50:09.001
and hopefully encourage other circles,

1022
00:50:09.001 --> 00:50:12.339
and also to provide that space on a regular basis

1023
00:50:12.339 --> 00:50:14.366
that women knew would just be there.

1024
00:50:14.366 --> 00:50:17.192
Jean always, and The Millionth Circle

1025
00:50:17.192 --> 00:50:19.656
and their guidance on creating circles

1026
00:50:19.656 --> 00:50:23.976
always suggests never having a single facilitator in circle

1027
00:50:23.976 --> 00:50:26.482
because the idea of the circle is,

1028
00:50:26.482 --> 00:50:29.106
there is no leader, no head.

1029
00:50:29.106 --> 00:50:31.612
But what I've found in Los Angeles

1030
00:50:31.612 --> 00:50:33.682
was that the women, especially the ones

1031
00:50:33.682 --> 00:50:36.469
that had to lead all the time for their work

1032
00:50:36.469 --> 00:50:38.249
or in their organizations,

1033
00:50:38.249 --> 00:50:40.783
were so happy to come and be able to just

1034
00:50:40.783 --> 00:50:44.036
kick back and know that things would be taken care of.

1035
00:50:44.036 --> 00:50:49.036
Yes, how it is important for whoever is facilitating

1036
00:50:49.774 --> 00:50:54.734
to let their egos behind because the idea of the circle

1037
00:50:54.734 --> 00:50:59.734
and being in the circumference of a circle container

1038
00:51:00.728 --> 00:51:05.400
is that there is no leader, and there is no intimidation.

1039
00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:08.600
It's really important to have a certain type of temperament

1040
00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:13.314
if you are going to be strictly the facilitator for a circle

1041
00:51:13.314 --> 00:51:16.098
or if you're just doing it for an evening.

1042
00:51:16.098 --> 00:51:18.903
There's certain guidelines for facilitating circles

1043
00:51:18.903 --> 00:51:20.599
that are very important.

1044
00:51:20.599 --> 00:51:21.676
<v Voiceover>I would think you would have to be</v>

1045
00:51:21.676 --> 00:51:26.082
fairly confident in your ability to hold energy and give

1046
00:51:26.082 --> 00:51:28.801
a little bit of instruction or guidance anyway, right?

1047
00:51:28.801 --> 00:51:30.540
<v ->Yeah, to be sensitive to what's happening</v>

1048
00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:32.257
with the energy of the circle.

1049
00:51:32.257 --> 00:51:34.977
Sometimes, someone does go into story

1050
00:51:34.977 --> 00:51:37.921
and you find that it's very important that,

1051
00:51:37.921 --> 00:51:41.291
for everyone, that it is completed,

1052
00:51:41.291 --> 00:51:43.819
and you don't want to interrupt that.

1053
00:51:43.819 --> 00:51:48.213
Or if a woman's crying, in circle,

1054
00:51:48.213 --> 00:51:50.859
it's very important for the women

1055
00:51:50.859 --> 00:51:55.859
to be guided not to hold back their nurturing quality

1056
00:51:56.149 --> 00:51:58.538
of wanting to immediately pull out a Kleenex

1057
00:51:58.538 --> 00:52:00.607
and hand it to the woman.

1058
00:52:00.607 --> 00:52:04.650
You want to allow someone to feel safe

1059
00:52:04.650 --> 00:52:07.594
to let, you know, whatever's coming out come out.

1060
00:52:07.594 --> 00:52:09.172
<v Voiceover>To complete itself.</v>

1061
00:52:09.172 --> 00:52:11.007
So really, it's quite simple.

1062
00:52:11.007 --> 00:52:13.567
It's a matter of desire and intention

1063
00:52:13.567 --> 00:52:15.956
and creating the space.

1064
00:52:15.956 --> 00:52:18.004
<v ->Yes, and the important word, too,</v>

1065
00:52:18.004 --> 00:52:19.881
we find is willingness.

1066
00:52:19.881 --> 00:52:22.067
The willingness to show up.

1067
00:52:22.067 --> 00:52:24.201
<v Voiceover>And you have a wonderful publication</v>

1068
00:52:24.201 --> 00:52:26.408
that you've created in support to all of this

1069
00:52:26.408 --> 00:52:29.608
and, really, to augment your endeavors called Spheres?

1070
00:52:29.608 --> 00:52:31.955
<v ->Yes, Spheres Circles, it started out as</v>

1071
00:52:31.955 --> 00:52:33.971
<v ->[Voiceover and Deborah] Spheres Women's Circles,</v>

1072
00:52:33.971 --> 00:52:37.597
<v ->Which, my website is still sphereswomenscircles.com.</v>

1073
00:52:37.597 --> 00:52:42.450
However, I found after doing the magazine for five years

1074
00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:45.629
that it felt very important to include men,

1075
00:52:45.629 --> 00:52:49.319
so it's become a one of a kind yin yang style magazine,

1076
00:52:49.319 --> 00:52:51.602
in which you flip over the cover and it's men,

1077
00:52:51.602 --> 00:52:54.567
and my husband is actually involved now, and that's been--

1078
00:52:54.567 --> 00:52:55.985
<v Voiceover>Oh, and he writes beautifully.</v>

1079
00:52:55.985 --> 00:52:57.148
<v ->Very symbolic thing.</v>

1080
00:52:57.148 --> 00:52:58.908
<v Voiceover>Yes, it is, it's a wonderful publication,</v>

1081
00:52:58.908 --> 00:53:00.913
and I'd encourage anybody watching,

1082
00:53:00.913 --> 00:53:04.134
they can get a copy of it through your website

1083
00:53:04.134 --> 00:53:06.555
or subscribe to it, right?

1084
00:53:06.555 --> 00:53:08.731
<v ->Yes, they can request a complimentary issue,</v>

1085
00:53:08.731 --> 00:53:10.448
and, or subscribe.

1086
00:53:10.448 --> 00:53:13.819
Well, what I have always said was how

1087
00:53:13.819 --> 00:53:18.010
being in circle has really helped me be

1088
00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:23.098
accepting of my own femininity,

1089
00:53:23.098 --> 00:53:26.554
and that was a tough thing growing up

1090
00:53:26.554 --> 00:53:28.943
in the times that we all did,

1091
00:53:28.943 --> 00:53:32.730
many of us women, with bringing out our masculine

1092
00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:35.908
more and more, and trying to be the super woman,

1093
00:53:35.908 --> 00:53:37.348
and handling it all.

1094
00:53:37.348 --> 00:53:39.396
So to just honor more and more

1095
00:53:39.396 --> 00:53:43.022
the feminine qualities of the nurturing,

1096
00:53:43.022 --> 00:53:47.171
of the listening, of the being a container and holding space

1097
00:53:47.171 --> 00:53:49.955
and how important that is to bring that

1098
00:53:49.955 --> 00:53:52.253
into all aspects of our lives.

1099
00:53:52.888 --> 00:53:55.000
<v ->If you enjoyed Jean's wisdom in this interview,</v>

1100
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.674
just click on some of the links below

1101
00:53:56.674 --> 00:53:58.135
to purchase one of her books.

1102
00:53:58.135 --> 00:54:00.226
No doubt, women can no longer afford

1103
00:54:00.226 --> 00:54:02.594
to bow to the status quo and keep their

1104
00:54:02.594 --> 00:54:06.177
talents, unique skills and contributions under a bushel.

1105
00:54:06.177 --> 00:54:08.332
If we don't come out now, when the world

1106
00:54:08.332 --> 00:54:10.977
is in desperate need of healing, then when?

1107
00:54:10.977 --> 00:54:13.275
Until next time, thanks for watching.

1108
00:54:14.134 --> 00:54:18.896
