00:00:00.124 --> 00:00:04.806 line:15% 
(gentle, melodic music)

2
00:00:19.549 --> 00:00:21.575
<v ->Get ready to be absolutely charmed</v>

3
00:00:21.575 --> 00:00:24.753
by a young man affectionately called Dougee.

4
00:00:24.753 --> 00:00:27.206
In 2005, Doug was a computer programmer

5
00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:29.115
living in Washington, DC.

6
00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:32.348
Like many of us kept asking if that's all there was to life.

7
00:00:32.348 --> 00:00:33.947
Where's the joy in all of it?

8
00:00:33.947 --> 00:00:35.900
The answer came for him when he was invited

9
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.491
to participate in what is called deeksha,

10
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:40.154
which is the transference of energy

11
00:00:40.154 --> 00:00:41.926
through an adept's eyes or hands

12
00:00:41.926 --> 00:00:43.345
into another person's field

13
00:00:43.345 --> 00:00:45.562
to help them expand their consciousness.

14
00:00:45.562 --> 00:00:48.004
For the first time he felt unbridled joy,

15
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:50.682
and decided then and there that this was his life's work.

16
00:00:50.682 --> 00:00:52.410
His journey took him to India

17
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.851
where he studied for years with

18
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:56.431
the master of deeksha, Sri Bhagavan.

19
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.437
Much to Doug's surprise he was chosen

20
00:00:58.437 --> 00:01:00.346
from among thousands to become

21
00:01:00.346 --> 00:01:03.066
one of a handful of people to administer deeksha

22
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:05.961
to individuals and groups around the world.

23
00:01:07.983 --> 00:01:09.732
It's so nice to meet you, Doug.

24
00:01:09.732 --> 00:01:13.487
This is something I've been curious about for a while,

25
00:01:13.487 --> 00:01:17.145
because I had run into your friend who has brought you here,

26
00:01:17.145 --> 00:01:19.365
an associate of yours in the deeksha,

27
00:01:20.908 --> 00:01:24.698
I wouldn't say movement, in this tradition.

28
00:01:24.698 --> 00:01:26.582
My son and I had met her in India,

29
00:01:26.582 --> 00:01:28.141
and Stuart had gone through this and said,

30
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:29.954
"Wow, this is a pretty profound experience."

31
00:01:29.954 --> 00:01:31.842
Then I start hearing about it elsewhere,

32
00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:34.338
and ultimately a few years ago

33
00:01:34.338 --> 00:01:36.983
a man who had created a type of very advanced

34
00:01:36.983 --> 00:01:39.745
neuro-feedback technology called Brain State,

35
00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:42.321
had apparently put some of the people

36
00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:46.013
who had undergone the deeksha on the machine,

37
00:01:46.013 --> 00:01:49.905
and their brain scored out at a really high

38
00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:53.308
fluid, balanced, harmonious level,

39
00:01:53.308 --> 00:01:54.587
which, I don't know,

40
00:01:54.587 --> 00:01:56.123
it's almost like it really boosts

41
00:01:56.123 --> 00:01:58.206
alpha and gamma or something.

42
00:01:59.576 --> 00:02:02.381
And so now I'm curious enough about it that you're here,

43
00:02:02.381 --> 00:02:03.831
and I'm thankful for that.

44
00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:06.249
And let's talk a little bit about what deeksha is,

45
00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:07.594
how it originated,

46
00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:10.718
and the man who originated it, and everything.

47
00:02:10.718 --> 00:02:11.819
<v ->Yep, totally.</v>

48
00:02:12.848 --> 00:02:14.284
One thing that should be known is

49
00:02:14.284 --> 00:02:17.381
deeksha's actually nothing so new.

50
00:02:17.381 --> 00:02:19.980
In very, very ancient cultures

51
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.292
it was always understood somebody

52
00:02:21.292 --> 00:02:24.117
who was very passionate to grow in consciousness,

53
00:02:24.117 --> 00:02:25.259
or to awaken.

54
00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:28.160
I guess in modern day terms we'd say seeking enlightenment.

55
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.237
They would actually go off

56
00:02:29.237 --> 00:02:31.755
and they'd find somebody who was matured or flowered

57
00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:33.610
in that state of consciousness.

58
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.351
The way that was understood in the very ancient cultures was

59
00:02:36.351 --> 00:02:38.791
the states of consciousness can actually transfer.

60
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:40.595
And you can figure that out any day of the week

61
00:02:40.595 --> 00:02:41.831
at your work environments.

62
00:02:41.831 --> 00:02:43.580
Go sit next to somebody who's in a bad mood,

63
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.679
you're not feeling so good.

64
00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:46.204
Go sit next to somebody who's in a good mood,

65
00:02:46.204 --> 00:02:47.888
you're feeling great.

66
00:02:47.888 --> 00:02:49.124
These great masters,

67
00:02:49.124 --> 00:02:51.961
what they would do is they would be in such a flowered state

68
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:54.180
that when the disciple or seeker's

69
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.971
spirituality would be ready,

70
00:02:55.971 --> 00:02:58.489
they would then move into a very high awakened state

71
00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.014
and transfer the state.

72
00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:01.251
That transference of the state

73
00:03:01.251 --> 00:03:02.894
was referred to as deeksha,

74
00:03:02.894 --> 00:03:04.483
which would then literally turn on

75
00:03:04.483 --> 00:03:06.392
the spiritual energies in an individual,

76
00:03:06.392 --> 00:03:08.259
which actually is what they call the kundalini,

77
00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:10.008
that spinal spiritual energy.

78
00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:11.288
It would turn it on,

79
00:03:11.288 --> 00:03:13.037
and it would be the master's job

80
00:03:13.037 --> 00:03:15.128
to make sure it starts flowing properly,

81
00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:16.407
which would elevate that seeker's

82
00:03:16.407 --> 00:03:18.541
state of consciousness in the higher states.

83
00:03:18.541 --> 00:03:20.653
It would eventually lead to a shift in the brain, actually.

84
00:03:20.653 --> 00:03:22.700
Actually changes in the brain have to happen,

85
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.597
where it would be actually a physiological,

86
00:03:24.597 --> 00:03:26.378
irreversible change would shift.

87
00:03:26.378 --> 00:03:28.842
And suddenly that sense of separate existence,

88
00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:31.338
the me and the not me, dissolves.

89
00:03:31.338 --> 00:03:33.044
So that was how it was done in the ancient time periods

90
00:03:33.044 --> 00:03:34.878
this thing called deeksha.

91
00:03:34.878 --> 00:03:38.142
The only downfall in the ancient time periods was

92
00:03:38.142 --> 00:03:40.564
to go see a master was very difficult,

93
00:03:40.564 --> 00:03:41.961
and if the master even would give it to you

94
00:03:41.961 --> 00:03:43.729
was another, bigger question.

95
00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:44.781
And he would probably only give it to

96
00:03:44.781 --> 00:03:47.224
a handful of people who were very serious.

97
00:03:47.224 --> 00:03:48.706
So it wasn't readily available,

98
00:03:48.706 --> 00:03:50.285
and was always very specific.

99
00:03:50.285 --> 00:03:51.895
That's the problem.

100
00:03:51.895 --> 00:03:53.602
The time period we're in right now,

101
00:03:53.602 --> 00:03:56.439
the entire species is needing a shift in consciousness,

102
00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:57.740
that's what's going on.

103
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.162
It's we see very clearly that all the technology

104
00:04:00.162 --> 00:04:02.456
on our planet, and the genius of humanity,

105
00:04:02.456 --> 00:04:05.793
is all intact to make us persevere,

106
00:04:05.793 --> 00:04:08.129
and to live on this planet in a very harmonious way.

107
00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.889
What's missing is a state of consciousness,

108
00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.004
to where a person actually feels connected

109
00:04:13.004 --> 00:04:14.689
and in love with other people.

110
00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:16.555
Right now we feel very isolated from each other,

111
00:04:16.555 --> 00:04:18.592
and we're sort of in competition to each other.

112
00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:19.787
It's a state of consciousness,

113
00:04:19.787 --> 00:04:21.632
it's a change in the brain that has to happen.

114
00:04:21.632 --> 00:04:23.136
<v Woman>Is it a little bit also</v>

115
00:04:23.136 --> 00:04:26.251
it has to be a change societally

116
00:04:26.251 --> 00:04:29.067
and in a paradigm

117
00:04:29.067 --> 00:04:32.225
in that we've been a very competitive type of environment

118
00:04:32.225 --> 00:04:33.760
up until this point in time.

119
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.495
<v ->Yes.</v>

120
00:04:34.495 --> 00:04:35.880
<v Woman>And I think people,</v>

121
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.810
they're seeing examples around them

122
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.698
of just the quirkiest businesses

123
00:04:39.698 --> 00:04:41.021
that are popping up, for example,

124
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:44.188
like a restaurant that says there is no price.

125
00:04:44.188 --> 00:04:46.828
You just leave what you think it was worth.

126
00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.263
Simple examples like that,

127
00:04:48.263 --> 00:04:51.772
but that's really more about this communal openness,

128
00:04:51.772 --> 00:04:53.830
and sharing, and coming to a higher state

129
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.838
that's not driven by fear.

130
00:04:55.838 --> 00:04:56.709
<v ->Very true.</v>

131
00:04:56.709 --> 00:04:58.521
Let us say we take a person,

132
00:04:58.521 --> 00:05:00.313
and we take a person who's in fear,

133
00:05:00.313 --> 00:05:02.297
we take a person who feels isolated,

134
00:05:02.297 --> 00:05:04.067
we take a person who's in a mode

135
00:05:04.067 --> 00:05:06.082
of trying a security of survival,

136
00:05:06.082 --> 00:05:08.804
so they're all the time only caring about themselves.

137
00:05:08.804 --> 00:05:10.307
If you take that person

138
00:05:10.307 --> 00:05:11.587
and you put them through any kind of

139
00:05:11.587 --> 00:05:13.432
very intense spiritual process,

140
00:05:13.432 --> 00:05:15.502
which actually awakens the energetic body

141
00:05:15.502 --> 00:05:17.293
and actually brings up the kundalini,

142
00:05:17.293 --> 00:05:19.363
as the kundalini is rising and moving up,

143
00:05:19.363 --> 00:05:21.826
very literally they'll start experiencing

144
00:05:21.826 --> 00:05:23.245
unconditional love,

145
00:05:23.245 --> 00:05:24.460
the move from the state of fear

146
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.167
to a sense of deep peace.

147
00:05:26.167 --> 00:05:28.364
As they're experiencing another person

148
00:05:28.364 --> 00:05:30.252
they'll feel very connected to them.

149
00:05:30.252 --> 00:05:31.511
Their mind won't be chattering,

150
00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:33.015
labeling everything they're experiencing,

151
00:05:33.015 --> 00:05:34.402
they'll be very quiet.

152
00:05:34.402 --> 00:05:35.618
So then you take that person

153
00:05:35.618 --> 00:05:38.518
who was only causing very big problems in society,

154
00:05:38.518 --> 00:05:40.737
coming from now this state of consciousness,

155
00:05:40.737 --> 00:05:42.571
their outlook on how they would deal with society

156
00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:44.962
would be 180 degrees different.

157
00:05:44.962 --> 00:05:46.390
So that's why when we see people

158
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.683
making those kinds of businesses you're speaking of,

159
00:05:48.683 --> 00:05:49.984
if you took them and somehow measure

160
00:05:49.984 --> 00:05:51.691
what state of consciousness they're in,

161
00:05:51.691 --> 00:05:52.725
you'd realize they're actually

162
00:05:52.725 --> 00:05:54.144
in a different state of consciousness

163
00:05:54.144 --> 00:05:57.034
compared to somebody like a very shrewd businessman

164
00:05:57.034 --> 00:05:59.893
who's only out there to service themself,

165
00:05:59.893 --> 00:06:01.098
but nobody else.

166
00:06:01.098 --> 00:06:03.167
You would see it's a different state of consciousness.

167
00:06:03.167 --> 00:06:04.586
So it's states of consciousness.

168
00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:07.068
<v Woman>I'm sorry, go ahead.</v>

169
00:06:07.068 --> 00:06:10.012
<v ->With deeksha, I was just gonna finish the deeksha thing.</v>

170
00:06:10.012 --> 00:06:11.965
The thing is in this time period

171
00:06:11.965 --> 00:06:13.713
is that the species is ready to evolve,

172
00:06:13.713 --> 00:06:14.896
that's the whole thing.

173
00:06:14.896 --> 00:06:17.532
And it's very clear. We're all connected globally.

174
00:06:17.532 --> 00:06:18.918
What's missing is kinda we're running on

175
00:06:18.918 --> 00:06:21.190
this old paradigm of the separation.

176
00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:25.251
So where before you had to go see one person

177
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:26.787
to give this deeksha to you,

178
00:06:26.787 --> 00:06:28.440
and hopefully that would help you,

179
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.795
what's happened is basically there's

180
00:06:29.795 --> 00:06:32.760
a phenomenon on the planet where deeksha is here,

181
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.819
but it's here in such a huge way

182
00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:37.049
that anybody can actually give it,

183
00:06:37.049 --> 00:06:38.776
and anybody can actually receive it.

184
00:06:38.776 --> 00:06:42.253
You don't have to go find yourself travelling, et cetera.

185
00:06:42.253 --> 00:06:44.706
So that's what unique about Oneness University is,

186
00:06:44.706 --> 00:06:45.933
it's a place where you can actually go

187
00:06:45.933 --> 00:06:47.416
and receive this deeksha,

188
00:06:47.416 --> 00:06:49.367
and not only that but you actually get empowered

189
00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:51.660
to where you can actually give this deeksha.

190
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.060
So you literally take anybody from any faith,

191
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.311
they all can give deeksha through their own faiths.

192
00:06:56.311 --> 00:06:58.123
It's not that they have to

193
00:06:58.123 --> 00:06:59.767
do it in any specific way.

194
00:06:59.767 --> 00:07:01.345
So all we care about is

195
00:07:01.345 --> 00:07:02.977
the people have the initiation

196
00:07:02.977 --> 00:07:05.293
or the process of awakening started in them.

197
00:07:05.293 --> 00:07:07.426
Doesn't matter which belief system they're on,

198
00:07:07.426 --> 00:07:08.993
path they're on, nothing like that,

199
00:07:08.993 --> 00:07:10.711
because it's all very physiological.

200
00:07:12.093 --> 00:07:14.185
<v Woman>And how long does this,</v>

201
00:07:14.185 --> 00:07:17.192
say if a person, the someone you talked about a moment ago,

202
00:07:17.192 --> 00:07:19.059
someone who is living in kind of

203
00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:22.063
a defensive position in fear for their own survival,

204
00:07:22.063 --> 00:07:24.550
which collapses you in on yourself, more or less,

205
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.374
and I'm sure you must see a lot of people

206
00:07:26.374 --> 00:07:29.179
like this because it's a painful state to be in,

207
00:07:29.179 --> 00:07:31.920
and no one really wants to feel like that anymore.

208
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.616
So when they come and they go through

209
00:07:33.616 --> 00:07:36.966
this process of deeksha,

210
00:07:36.966 --> 00:07:39.482
how long does that generally last with them?

211
00:07:39.482 --> 00:07:41.605
Is it something that has to be

212
00:07:41.605 --> 00:07:45.111
constantly reinforced,

213
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:47.287
or is it a one shot deal,

214
00:07:47.287 --> 00:07:48.588
or is it different for everyone?

215
00:07:48.588 --> 00:07:51.202
<v ->I can honestly say it's vastly different for everyone.</v>

216
00:07:51.202 --> 00:07:55.446
We've had cases where literally indigenous farmers

217
00:07:55.446 --> 00:07:58.475
in the nearby villages from where the Oneness University is,

218
00:07:58.475 --> 00:08:00.032
we actually have video footage of this,

219
00:08:00.032 --> 00:08:02.230
they literally came and had one deeksha,

220
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.776
and six hours later they had

221
00:08:03.776 --> 00:08:05.440
literally become an awakened being.

222
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.411
And I'm not saying awakening

223
00:08:06.411 --> 00:08:07.797
that they feel like they're in a good state,

224
00:08:07.797 --> 00:08:10.357
I'm talking about the actual shift that Buddha had

225
00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:13.279
where the sense of self is irreversibly gone.

226
00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:16.170
So they're an actual enlightened being, one deeksha.

227
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.407
So we've seen that,

228
00:08:17.407 --> 00:08:20.191
where people with not such a strong mind,

229
00:08:20.191 --> 00:08:22.570
it happens extremely, extremely fast.

230
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.863
<v Woman>That makes sense. The receptivity is there.</v>

231
00:08:24.863 --> 00:08:26.164
<v ->Exactly.</v>

232
00:08:26.164 --> 00:08:28.137
The problem with the western cultures is

233
00:08:28.137 --> 00:08:30.249
we have thicker minds, in a sense.

234
00:08:30.249 --> 00:08:31.401
We have so many layers

235
00:08:31.401 --> 00:08:33.616
of what we consider to be ourselves.

236
00:08:33.616 --> 00:08:35.775
So we've noticed with deeksha

237
00:08:35.775 --> 00:08:38.697
that it's people who keep receiving it,

238
00:08:38.697 --> 00:08:40.852
it keeps pushing them, and pushing them, and pushing them.

239
00:08:40.852 --> 00:08:42.291
The one thing we have noticed is

240
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:44.062
anybody who starts taking deeksha,

241
00:08:44.062 --> 00:08:46.333
we've noticed that it can be a journey,

242
00:08:46.333 --> 00:08:47.741
an up and down kind of journey,

243
00:08:47.741 --> 00:08:49.565
because the engines are getting kicked on,

244
00:08:49.565 --> 00:08:51.336
and it's sort of an up and down journey.

245
00:08:51.336 --> 00:08:53.854
But when they go back down to a lower state,

246
00:08:53.854 --> 00:08:56.231
it's not necessarily the state they initially were in.

247
00:08:56.231 --> 00:08:58.727
There's a big flowering that takes place, actually.

248
00:08:58.727 --> 00:09:00.925
Now the whole purpose of deeksha actually is

249
00:09:00.925 --> 00:09:03.442
as we increase the phenomenon this year,

250
00:09:03.442 --> 00:09:04.698
Sri Amma and Sri Bhagavan are actually

251
00:09:04.698 --> 00:09:05.882
increasing the whole phenomenon

252
00:09:05.882 --> 00:09:07.365
in a very, very big way,

253
00:09:07.365 --> 00:09:09.839
is that eventually it would just only be one deeksha

254
00:09:09.839 --> 00:09:11.855
that would basically cause an irreversible shift

255
00:09:11.855 --> 00:09:13.198
in a huge way.

256
00:09:13.198 --> 00:09:14.052
But we've noticed people

257
00:09:14.052 --> 00:09:16.120
who take deeksha over and over again,

258
00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.935
like in their communities and things like that,

259
00:09:17.935 --> 00:09:19.556
they keep on going deeper and deeper.

260
00:09:19.556 --> 00:09:21.124
That's what we've noticed.

261
00:09:21.124 --> 00:09:22.159
<v Woman>And you were talking about</v>

262
00:09:22.159 --> 00:09:23.342
the farmers a moment ago.

263
00:09:23.342 --> 00:09:24.942
One thing that strikes me about that

264
00:09:24.942 --> 00:09:26.137
is you're talking about people

265
00:09:26.137 --> 00:09:29.524
who are very much in harmony with natural law.

266
00:09:29.524 --> 00:09:31.311
And so they have the influences of nature

267
00:09:31.311 --> 00:09:33.560
already running through their systems,

268
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.630
which quiets the mind to begin with.

269
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:39.438
So how does nature, and natural law,

270
00:09:39.438 --> 00:09:40.728
factor into this?

271
00:09:40.728 --> 00:09:42.993
<v ->Yeah, we've noticed that when a person's</v>

272
00:09:42.993 --> 00:09:44.803
immersed deeply in society,

273
00:09:44.803 --> 00:09:48.270
and under all the stress and pressures of civilization,

274
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.381
it adds to so many layers of protectionism,

275
00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:52.174
and survival, and security.

276
00:09:52.174 --> 00:09:54.550
You take a guy who's just living out onto a farmland

277
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.578
with nothing much to do but just grow some grain,

278
00:09:56.578 --> 00:09:59.447
and live his life, there's a tremendous peace,

279
00:09:59.447 --> 00:10:01.228
and a sense of just living that's happening,

280
00:10:01.228 --> 00:10:02.881
a beingness that's very natural with him.

281
00:10:02.881 --> 00:10:04.162
He could have been born that way

282
00:10:04.162 --> 00:10:06.230
because his family was from the same farm.

283
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.692
There was never that kind of stress.

284
00:10:07.692 --> 00:10:09.132
That's why a person who's in nature,

285
00:10:09.132 --> 00:10:11.041
and who's just kind of just living and being,

286
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:12.225
it's very easy to put them into

287
00:10:12.225 --> 00:10:13.729
much higher states of consciousness.

288
00:10:13.729 --> 00:10:14.902
<v Woman>Yes, that makes sense.</v>

289
00:10:14.902 --> 00:10:16.747
Well, now I want to find out about

290
00:10:16.747 --> 00:10:21.483
your journey in a moment, and you live in India, right?

291
00:10:21.483 --> 00:10:24.395
You live there at the Oneness University,

292
00:10:24.395 --> 00:10:27.445
which, what a stunning facility that is,

293
00:10:27.445 --> 00:10:28.778
and we're going to talk about that

294
00:10:28.778 --> 00:10:30.912
because in and of itself that's a story.

295
00:10:30.912 --> 00:10:35.327
So let's start first with talking about Sri Bhagavan,

296
00:10:35.327 --> 00:10:38.222
and how this came about in this way,

297
00:10:38.222 --> 00:10:40.766
and then we'll go into your personal story.

298
00:10:40.766 --> 00:10:41.842
<v ->Sure.</v>

299
00:10:41.842 --> 00:10:45.255
Basically the best way to describe Sri Bhagavan

300
00:10:45.255 --> 00:10:48.541
is there's beings that basically when they're born

301
00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:50.226
simply know why they're here.

302
00:10:50.226 --> 00:10:51.890
And we've seen them throughout our societies,

303
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.674
they're like very driven beings

304
00:10:54.674 --> 00:10:56.583
in a very specific direction.

305
00:10:56.583 --> 00:10:58.374
Strangely with Sri Bhagavan was

306
00:10:58.374 --> 00:10:59.879
when he was a child,

307
00:10:59.879 --> 00:11:01.041
he wouldn't actually be playing

308
00:11:01.041 --> 00:11:02.354
so much with other kids or anything,

309
00:11:02.354 --> 00:11:04.412
he would actually sit very quietly.

310
00:11:04.412 --> 00:11:05.969
And when he was asked at a certain age,

311
00:11:05.969 --> 00:11:07.676
maybe seven or eight years old,

312
00:11:07.676 --> 00:11:08.838
his father used to ask him,

313
00:11:08.838 --> 00:11:10.012
"What are you here to do?"

314
00:11:10.012 --> 00:11:11.942
"What do you plan to do when you get older?"

315
00:11:11.942 --> 00:11:14.092
<v Woman>Which is not an unusual question in India.</v>

316
00:11:14.092 --> 00:11:14.974
<v ->No.</v>

317
00:11:14.974 --> 00:11:16.043
That's like parents were all the time

318
00:11:16.043 --> 00:11:17.185
saying, "What do you want to be when you get older,"

319
00:11:17.185 --> 00:11:18.463
and pushing him in that direction.

320
00:11:18.463 --> 00:11:20.832
So Sri Bhagavan would very literally explain,

321
00:11:20.832 --> 00:11:23.530
"The species is about to go through a transformation.

322
00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:24.917
"I'm here to help with this,

323
00:11:24.917 --> 00:11:26.623
"I'll be doing it when I'm a little bit older."

324
00:11:26.623 --> 00:11:27.509
<v Woman>When he was seven?</v>

325
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:28.363
<v ->Seven years old.</v>

326
00:11:28.363 --> 00:11:31.274
<v Woman>Okay, so he was clear. He was very clear.</v>

327
00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:34.357
<v ->So if you, mystically speaking,</v>

328
00:11:34.357 --> 00:11:36.020
this is what Sri Bhagavan would describe,

329
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.325
he'd say when he was around three years old

330
00:11:38.325 --> 00:11:39.540
there was an orb of light

331
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.290
that came and sat in front of him.

332
00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.051
It didn't leave until he was 24 years old.

333
00:11:44.051 --> 00:11:45.737
It was this orb of light.

334
00:11:45.737 --> 00:11:47.220
And there was some kind of mantra

335
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.436
that was just going on,

336
00:11:48.436 --> 00:11:50.451
being chanted constantly in his head,

337
00:11:50.451 --> 00:11:52.436
moving into the orb.

338
00:11:52.436 --> 00:11:54.942
He says he doesn't know anything about it at that age,

339
00:11:54.942 --> 00:11:56.744
he didn't understand it at that point.

340
00:11:56.744 --> 00:11:59.059
But he knew it was a part of the phenomenon

341
00:11:59.059 --> 00:12:01.483
that he's a part of to help the species.

342
00:12:02.619 --> 00:12:04.368
As he grew and matured more and more,

343
00:12:04.368 --> 00:12:05.584
and he flowered more and more

344
00:12:05.584 --> 00:12:07.835
of understanding why he's here on the planet,

345
00:12:07.835 --> 00:12:09.541
what's needed for humanity,

346
00:12:09.541 --> 00:12:11.899
he realized what needs to happen is

347
00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:15.418
the gift of awakening has to be given to the species,

348
00:12:15.418 --> 00:12:17.061
just like in the ancient times.

349
00:12:17.061 --> 00:12:19.280
It's not that we can really send everyone an email

350
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.370
and say, "Hey, everyone, just become awakened."

351
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.726
And it doesn't work like that, it has to be given.

352
00:12:23.726 --> 00:12:26.404
So in 1989, Sri Bhagavan,

353
00:12:26.404 --> 00:12:29.134
he founded a small boarding public school.

354
00:12:29.134 --> 00:12:30.563
That's where kids would come and live.

355
00:12:30.563 --> 00:12:32.569
And him and his wife Sri Amma,

356
00:12:32.569 --> 00:12:33.977
they basically would teach kids,

357
00:12:33.977 --> 00:12:35.151
and it was a very unique school.

358
00:12:35.151 --> 00:12:37.208
It was a school not based on any kind of competition.

359
00:12:37.208 --> 00:12:39.993
The kids decided all the rules of the school.

360
00:12:39.993 --> 00:12:41.657
So the kids were actually put as leaders,

361
00:12:41.657 --> 00:12:42.830
it was very cool.

362
00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.817
At the school in 1989 what happened was

363
00:12:45.817 --> 00:12:48.483
that golden ball that was in front of Sri Bhagavan

364
00:12:48.483 --> 00:12:50.734
for those 21 years or so,

365
00:12:50.734 --> 00:12:54.028
started descending into all the children in the school.

366
00:12:54.028 --> 00:12:55.287
Very literally, in fact.

367
00:12:55.287 --> 00:12:56.387
I know many of children

368
00:12:56.387 --> 00:12:58.168
because they're the guides at the university,

369
00:12:58.168 --> 00:13:00.749
and they would describe it in detail what happened.

370
00:13:00.749 --> 00:13:02.541
All these kids who knew nothing much

371
00:13:02.541 --> 00:13:04.022
about spirituality at all

372
00:13:04.022 --> 00:13:06.445
started having vastly mystical experiences.

373
00:13:06.445 --> 00:13:07.660
Not that Sri Bhagavan suddenly said,

374
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.751
"Hey, everyone, we're gonna practice spirituality,"

375
00:13:09.751 --> 00:13:11.170
nothing like that at all.

376
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.931
Very literally the orbs would descend into the children,

377
00:13:13.931 --> 00:13:16.054
who what their god was from their family,

378
00:13:16.054 --> 00:13:17.448
because in India you know there's so many

379
00:13:17.448 --> 00:13:19.411
various ideas of god.

380
00:13:19.411 --> 00:13:21.083
They would literally see their divine.

381
00:13:21.083 --> 00:13:22.075
And they would see their divine,

382
00:13:22.075 --> 00:13:23.217
it would speak to them,

383
00:13:23.217 --> 00:13:25.860
and it take them on astral journeys,

384
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.011
it would talk to them about things,

385
00:13:27.011 --> 00:13:28.110
it could be healing other kids,

386
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:29.229
all sorts of things.

387
00:13:29.229 --> 00:13:31.256
One of the guys I know who was a student there

388
00:13:31.256 --> 00:13:33.251
would say that no one would ever wear glasses,

389
00:13:33.251 --> 00:13:34.434
because all the kids would just walk up

390
00:13:34.434 --> 00:13:36.034
and be healing each other.

391
00:13:36.034 --> 00:13:37.624
This was going on in a big way.

392
00:13:37.624 --> 00:13:38.721
It started actually spreading

393
00:13:38.721 --> 00:13:40.610
beyond the boundaries of the school.

394
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:42.594
It was not that it was like,

395
00:13:42.594 --> 00:13:44.811
"We're a spiritual school and this is what we're doing."

396
00:13:44.811 --> 00:13:48.534
It was a phenomenon spontaneously happening.

397
00:13:48.534 --> 00:13:50.764
That was the phenomenon of deeksha.

398
00:13:50.764 --> 00:13:53.344
So in 1989 this thing started spreading like crazy.

399
00:13:53.344 --> 00:13:55.862
It spread so fast and so strong,

400
00:13:55.862 --> 00:13:58.122
and people had such big awakening experiences

401
00:13:58.122 --> 00:14:00.513
that very literally the authorities got involved

402
00:14:00.513 --> 00:14:02.401
and tried to shut the whole thing down.

403
00:14:02.401 --> 00:14:05.611
So Bhagavan said, "It's not time, humanity's not ready yet."

404
00:14:05.611 --> 00:14:07.286
And he withdrew the phenomenon,

405
00:14:07.286 --> 00:14:09.439
because you can say Sri Bhagavan

406
00:14:09.439 --> 00:14:11.146
very much could just simply,

407
00:14:11.146 --> 00:14:12.543
he'd say he's in control of the phenomenon,

408
00:14:12.543 --> 00:14:13.579
that's one way to say it.

409
00:14:13.579 --> 00:14:15.188
<v Woman>He can either hold the field in,</v>

410
00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:16.128
or express it.

411
00:14:16.128 --> 00:14:17.034
<v ->Exactly.</v>

412
00:14:17.034 --> 00:14:19.189
So very literally he withdrew the phenomenon

413
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:20.628
to certain degree.

414
00:14:20.628 --> 00:14:22.986
And he said, "Let us be a school, a spiritual school.

415
00:14:22.986 --> 00:14:24.149
"And we'll release the phenomenon

416
00:14:24.149 --> 00:14:25.737
"in more of a controlled manner."

417
00:14:25.737 --> 00:14:27.273
And so basically that's what's been going on

418
00:14:27.273 --> 00:14:29.183
with Oneness University for the last 20 years.

419
00:14:29.183 --> 00:14:31.709
The whole heart of what we do is

420
00:14:31.709 --> 00:14:34.633
we help people see where they're at in consciousness.

421
00:14:34.633 --> 00:14:36.500
We help them see the conflicted mind.

422
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.068
Then we give the deeksha

423
00:14:38.068 --> 00:14:39.956
to help basically awaken the body,

424
00:14:39.956 --> 00:14:41.396
to make it move past the mind.

425
00:14:41.396 --> 00:14:42.558
That's the whole thing.

426
00:14:42.558 --> 00:14:44.733
So basically we're the person you go see

427
00:14:44.733 --> 00:14:45.928
to give you the deeksha,

428
00:14:45.928 --> 00:14:47.186
that's what we're doing at large.

429
00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:49.256
We're basically you come here where they blast you,

430
00:14:49.256 --> 00:14:51.250
you move into a state.

431
00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:54.396
Now this year onwards is very literally where

432
00:14:54.396 --> 00:14:55.944
Bhagavan is once again

433
00:14:55.944 --> 00:14:57.629
is just simply releasing the phenomenon

434
00:14:57.629 --> 00:14:58.952
across the whole planet.

435
00:14:58.952 --> 00:15:00.938
No more being any kind of boundaries or boxes.

436
00:15:00.938 --> 00:15:01.888
<v Woman>Wonderful.</v>

437
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.736
And you, how did you become involved in all this?

438
00:15:06.736 --> 00:15:07.995
When did you hear about it?

439
00:15:07.995 --> 00:15:10.726
We had a little chat off-camera prior to this,

440
00:15:10.726 --> 00:15:13.754
and you've been studying many different

441
00:15:13.754 --> 00:15:16.347
streams of information through the years.

442
00:15:16.347 --> 00:15:19.504
And at one point obviously you came in connection with this,

443
00:15:19.504 --> 00:15:21.370
and you've now really devoted yourself

444
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.134
to helping spread this phenomenon.

445
00:15:24.134 --> 00:15:24.965
<v ->Yeah.</v>

446
00:15:26.053 --> 00:15:28.303
I was just a computer person from Washington, DC.

447
00:15:28.303 --> 00:15:29.828
I don't come from any religious background,

448
00:15:29.828 --> 00:15:31.674
spiritual background, nothing like that at all.

449
00:15:31.674 --> 00:15:33.402
Not even much of an educational background

450
00:15:33.402 --> 00:15:34.640
besides public school.

451
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.207
I just got caught onto computers,

452
00:15:36.207 --> 00:15:37.775
I lucked out and got a nice job,

453
00:15:37.775 --> 00:15:39.322
and then from there just kind of

454
00:15:39.322 --> 00:15:40.983
followed whatever passions came my way.

455
00:15:42.354 --> 00:15:43.656
My coworker happened to be

456
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.574
a Tibetan kind of monk person.

457
00:15:46.574 --> 00:15:48.663
He's a very talented computer person,

458
00:15:48.663 --> 00:15:51.468
and he started showing me basic meditation.

459
00:15:51.468 --> 00:15:52.909
I started doing it all,

460
00:15:52.909 --> 00:15:54.765
and him and I were really passionate

461
00:15:54.765 --> 00:15:56.748
about becoming awakened at that point.

462
00:15:56.748 --> 00:15:59.191
But I found that no matter how hard I'd try,

463
00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:00.716
I didn't really seem to make it happen.

464
00:16:00.716 --> 00:16:02.359
I'm an American so I'm thinking

465
00:16:02.359 --> 00:16:04.609
you just do it once or twice, and it should all work.

466
00:16:06.579 --> 00:16:07.933
<v Woman>Don't wanna do the input.</v>

467
00:16:07.933 --> 00:16:08.826
<v ->Exactly.</v>

468
00:16:08.826 --> 00:16:09.734
I didn't realize people have been on

469
00:16:09.734 --> 00:16:10.959
this spiritual path for 30 years,

470
00:16:10.959 --> 00:16:11.888
I literally though, "Hey, man,

471
00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:14.419
"I did this for three weeks, where's my awakening?"

472
00:16:14.419 --> 00:16:16.013
So I started searching on the internet

473
00:16:16.013 --> 00:16:18.817
because I was getting sort of bored

474
00:16:18.817 --> 00:16:19.960
of the sense that I'm sitting here trying,

475
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.398
it's not happening.

476
00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:22.977
I came across a video on the internet

477
00:16:22.977 --> 00:16:24.429
where a woman was in India,

478
00:16:24.429 --> 00:16:27.147
and she was just absolutely in tears, this woman.

479
00:16:27.147 --> 00:16:28.588
It was an older lady, and she was crying,

480
00:16:28.588 --> 00:16:29.659
and you could tell she was

481
00:16:29.659 --> 00:16:30.967
in some kind of state of consciousness.

482
00:16:30.967 --> 00:16:32.439
She says, "I've been on this spiritual path

483
00:16:32.439 --> 00:16:36.298
"for 35 years and I've tried everything you can think of.

484
00:16:36.298 --> 00:16:38.149
"I'm here, it's the year 2004,

485
00:16:38.149 --> 00:16:40.282
"and there's some festival going on

486
00:16:40.282 --> 00:16:41.380
"where spiritual masters

487
00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.493
"from all across the lands have gathered.

488
00:16:43.493 --> 00:16:45.018
"There's some monk here

489
00:16:45.018 --> 00:16:47.802
"on behalf of Sri Bhagavan from Oneness University

490
00:16:47.802 --> 00:16:49.806
"giving some rare energy transfer

491
00:16:49.806 --> 00:16:51.514
"for awakening called Deeksha.

492
00:16:51.514 --> 00:16:55.342
"I never, ever thought awakening could be given,

493
00:16:55.342 --> 00:16:57.049
"but they gave me the deeksha,

494
00:16:57.049 --> 00:16:59.022
"and it's now been one week's time,

495
00:16:59.022 --> 00:17:01.913
"and I am in the most vastest state of consciousness

496
00:17:01.913 --> 00:17:03.069
"I have ever experienced

497
00:17:03.069 --> 00:17:04.995
"in my entire journey of 35 years."

498
00:17:04.995 --> 00:17:07.470
And she literally started describing the state she was in.

499
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:09.113
And I was sold.

500
00:17:09.113 --> 00:17:10.776
First of all, I wasn't sold, I was thinking,

501
00:17:10.776 --> 00:17:13.848
"If this is real I definitely want this one."

502
00:17:13.848 --> 00:17:17.420
So I very reluctantly went and started researching

503
00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.391
as much as I could to make sure

504
00:17:18.391 --> 00:17:19.533
this wasn't anything strange,

505
00:17:19.533 --> 00:17:21.709
or I'm getting myself involved in anything, or whatever.

506
00:17:21.709 --> 00:17:23.713
And I just went and received a deeksha.

507
00:17:23.713 --> 00:17:25.122
And I can tell you this much,

508
00:17:25.122 --> 00:17:27.522
I always thought spirituality was mystical experience this,

509
00:17:27.522 --> 00:17:29.346
mystical experience that.

510
00:17:29.346 --> 00:17:30.956
That day when I received a deeksha,

511
00:17:30.956 --> 00:17:32.555
for the first time in my life

512
00:17:32.555 --> 00:17:34.935
I actually just felt love for myself

513
00:17:34.935 --> 00:17:36.107
and for anybody else.

514
00:17:36.107 --> 00:17:37.676
I was just in love.

515
00:17:37.676 --> 00:17:39.703
<v Woman>That's beautiful.</v>

516
00:17:39.703 --> 00:17:41.291
And this was how long ago now?

517
00:17:41.291 --> 00:17:42.348
<v ->2005.</v>

518
00:17:42.348 --> 00:17:44.118
<v Woman>2005.</v>

519
00:17:44.118 --> 00:17:46.326
You know, as I'm listening to you,

520
00:17:46.326 --> 00:17:48.647
something's bubbling up, I'm thinking about this,

521
00:17:48.647 --> 00:17:49.979
and I'm going to go back to that

522
00:17:49.979 --> 00:17:53.596
original comment at the top of the interview

523
00:17:53.596 --> 00:17:55.942
about the Brain State technology.

524
00:17:55.942 --> 00:17:59.292
Which is it's working on a neuro-biological level as well.

525
00:18:03.065 --> 00:18:05.102
Essentially when people finish with that

526
00:18:05.102 --> 00:18:07.685
it's a very similar kind of thing you're talking about.

527
00:18:07.685 --> 00:18:09.838
But it's an expensive technology,

528
00:18:09.838 --> 00:18:11.598
to try to find someone to do it,

529
00:18:11.598 --> 00:18:13.699
and go through the process it takes time,

530
00:18:13.699 --> 00:18:15.214
it takes a lot of money.

531
00:18:15.214 --> 00:18:18.574
But essentially this common phenomena

532
00:18:18.574 --> 00:18:21.631
of freeing a person from this

533
00:18:21.631 --> 00:18:23.945
low level anxiety and fear,

534
00:18:23.945 --> 00:18:25.631
it just seems to dissipate.

535
00:18:25.631 --> 00:18:27.743
So there's something happening

536
00:18:27.743 --> 00:18:30.302
on a neuro-biological level with that

537
00:18:30.302 --> 00:18:32.030
that sounds very similar.

538
00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.739
This energy transference is accomplishing

539
00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:36.563
the same thing in minutes

540
00:18:36.563 --> 00:18:39.326
without having to go through all the rest of it,

541
00:18:39.326 --> 00:18:40.744
including the expense.

542
00:18:40.744 --> 00:18:41.619
<v ->Totally.</v>

543
00:18:41.619 --> 00:18:43.028
Sri Bhagavan actually explained once,

544
00:18:43.028 --> 00:18:45.704
he said humanity would actually develop

545
00:18:45.704 --> 00:18:48.125
in probably the next 50 to 100 years

546
00:18:48.125 --> 00:18:50.258
with the technological abilities

547
00:18:50.258 --> 00:18:52.349
to cause a shift to the brain.

548
00:18:52.349 --> 00:18:53.853
It would catch onto this,

549
00:18:53.853 --> 00:18:56.050
but we're at such a critical moment right now

550
00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:57.680
that the shift has to happen now.

551
00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.631
<v Woman>Yeah, that's excellent.</v>

552
00:18:58.631 --> 00:19:00.911
<v ->That's exactly where Bhagavan's stance is.</v>

553
00:19:00.911 --> 00:19:03.279
When we say awakening has to be given,

554
00:19:03.279 --> 00:19:05.615
if you wanna, we can take it one more level,

555
00:19:05.615 --> 00:19:07.279
it's very simple to look at.

556
00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:09.327
Is when it says it's to be given,

557
00:19:09.327 --> 00:19:11.119
it actually means it's the divine consciousness

558
00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:12.260
that gives it.

559
00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.777
Everyone would say, "Well, what about Buddha, maybe?"

560
00:19:14.777 --> 00:19:16.036
If you actually look at Buddha

561
00:19:16.036 --> 00:19:17.806
he didn't achieve it on his own.

562
00:19:17.806 --> 00:19:19.769
He got all the way to the door,

563
00:19:19.769 --> 00:19:23.651
and he actually was literally couldn't make it.

564
00:19:23.651 --> 00:19:25.742
And only then did the divine energy

565
00:19:25.742 --> 00:19:28.792
or divine intelligence cause the big shift inside of him.

566
00:19:28.792 --> 00:19:30.829
That was the one thing that was very understood

567
00:19:30.829 --> 00:19:33.261
is that a seeker can get to the door,

568
00:19:33.261 --> 00:19:34.669
but it has to be a higher intelligence

569
00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:37.486
has to step in and do something about it, et cetera.

570
00:19:37.486 --> 00:19:38.541
So that's why when you're talking about

571
00:19:38.541 --> 00:19:40.674
changes in the brain, bringing up the kundalini,

572
00:19:40.674 --> 00:19:42.082
opening up the energy centers,

573
00:19:42.082 --> 00:19:43.629
the whole balance of the body,

574
00:19:43.629 --> 00:19:45.388
the different sheaths of your body called koshas,

575
00:19:45.388 --> 00:19:46.615
all these kind of things.

576
00:19:46.615 --> 00:19:48.770
It takes an extraordinary kind of intelligence

577
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.297
outside of our intellectualism.

578
00:19:51.297 --> 00:19:52.791
<v Woman>Yeah, intellect won't take you there.</v>

579
00:19:52.791 --> 00:19:53.685
<v ->Exactly.</v>

580
00:19:53.685 --> 00:19:56.204
So technology is trying to catch onto this,

581
00:19:56.204 --> 00:19:57.589
but it may take a little bit more time

582
00:19:57.589 --> 00:19:59.340
for it to have the perfection of

583
00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.396
knowing how to exactly to do it.

584
00:20:00.396 --> 00:20:01.409
<v Woman>Well, it's so elegant</v>

585
00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:03.233
that you can simply remove the technology

586
00:20:03.233 --> 00:20:04.490
and have it within the aura

587
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:06.102
and intention of the person

588
00:20:06.102 --> 00:20:08.436
who's choosing to share it with another.

589
00:20:08.436 --> 00:20:09.632
So much more efficient.

590
00:20:09.632 --> 00:20:10.447
And as you say,

591
00:20:10.447 --> 00:20:11.396
if you're trying to do it quickly

592
00:20:11.396 --> 00:20:13.391
this is the way it has to be done.

593
00:20:13.391 --> 00:20:15.993
Okay, so I don't want to interrupt your part,

594
00:20:15.993 --> 00:20:17.348
so you heard this experience,

595
00:20:17.348 --> 00:20:18.692
you said, "I've gotta find out about it."

596
00:20:18.692 --> 00:20:20.910
So how did it continue from there,

597
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.118
because now you do this all over.

598
00:20:23.118 --> 00:20:23.895
<v ->Yeah.</v>

599
00:20:23.895 --> 00:20:26.755
So basically I had this experience

600
00:20:26.755 --> 00:20:28.652
where I was just feeling love.

601
00:20:28.652 --> 00:20:31.512
It took me literally my car at the train

602
00:20:31.512 --> 00:20:33.666
at the end of work was literally

603
00:20:33.666 --> 00:20:35.702
like a five minute walk away.

604
00:20:35.702 --> 00:20:37.858
It took me 45 minutes to get to my car.

605
00:20:37.858 --> 00:20:39.788
I was walking, I was touching leaves,

606
00:20:39.788 --> 00:20:41.083
I was looking at the sky.

607
00:20:42.434 --> 00:20:46.382
I was happy for the first time in my life, really happy.

608
00:20:46.382 --> 00:20:49.963
And it was a peak experience, so it faded off over time.

609
00:20:49.963 --> 00:20:52.032
But it was such a glimpse of the fact

610
00:20:52.032 --> 00:20:54.165
that they're not kidding when they say unconditional love.

611
00:20:54.165 --> 00:20:57.284
It's real, it was a state, and it has to be given.

612
00:20:57.284 --> 00:20:58.694
It was to happen to you.

613
00:20:58.694 --> 00:21:01.884
So I said, "Okay, this is cool."

614
00:21:01.884 --> 00:21:04.368
Now there was another man who was a young man

615
00:21:04.368 --> 00:21:05.883
who was about my age,

616
00:21:05.883 --> 00:21:07.387
and there were some rumors passing around

617
00:21:07.387 --> 00:21:09.094
that he had moved into a very, very

618
00:21:09.094 --> 00:21:11.236
high awakened state through this process.

619
00:21:12.447 --> 00:21:13.609
I immediately signed up to go to India

620
00:21:13.609 --> 00:21:16.489
to try this 21-day process, it was 21 days back then.

621
00:21:16.489 --> 00:21:18.448
So I went over the 21-day process

622
00:21:18.448 --> 00:21:20.953
and this man was there, this young kid.

623
00:21:20.953 --> 00:21:22.864
And he was in this very high awakened state,

624
00:21:22.864 --> 00:21:25.296
and he actually stayed there to become a Oneness guide,

625
00:21:25.296 --> 00:21:26.681
or a teacher there.

626
00:21:26.681 --> 00:21:29.562
And so when I saw somebody my age from my country

627
00:21:29.562 --> 00:21:30.906
in this kind of state of consciousness,

628
00:21:30.906 --> 00:21:31.983
I'm not kidding, it's not like he was,

629
00:21:31.983 --> 00:21:33.285
"Oh, I'm in a good state."

630
00:21:33.285 --> 00:21:35.929
No, if you read about with saints and sages,

631
00:21:35.929 --> 00:21:37.388
and these vast states of consciousness.

632
00:21:37.388 --> 00:21:38.731
<v Woman>Light pouring out of his eyes.</v>

633
00:21:38.731 --> 00:21:41.046
<v ->Being able to move into meditation</v>

634
00:21:41.046 --> 00:21:43.946
to where you're like in a extraordinarily deep state,

635
00:21:43.946 --> 00:21:47.862
not like trying to meditate, an actual hardcore state.

636
00:21:47.862 --> 00:21:50.151
When I saw that, and I saw the authenticity of that,

637
00:21:50.151 --> 00:21:52.111
I literally said to myself,

638
00:21:52.111 --> 00:21:54.693
"There may be a thousand paths out there,

639
00:21:54.693 --> 00:21:56.325
"but this is definitely one of them

640
00:21:56.325 --> 00:21:58.575
"that does actually truly deliver

641
00:21:58.575 --> 00:22:00.016
"what it says it delivers."

642
00:22:00.016 --> 00:22:01.381
Because they're not kidding.

643
00:22:01.381 --> 00:22:03.289
They are here to give the state of awakening

644
00:22:03.289 --> 00:22:04.857
and god-realization to people.

645
00:22:04.857 --> 00:22:06.073
And they can do it.

646
00:22:06.073 --> 00:22:07.482
And when I looked at all the monks

647
00:22:07.482 --> 00:22:09.283
they were in these similar states.

648
00:22:09.283 --> 00:22:10.851
These kids are all my age.

649
00:22:10.851 --> 00:22:13.572
I was 25 back then, all of them are 25, 26 years old,

650
00:22:13.572 --> 00:22:15.300
and they were flowered human beings.

651
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.830
So I'm like, "Okay, there's probably many of them,

652
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:20.601
"but this is one that actually does it."

653
00:22:20.601 --> 00:22:22.308
So I just immediately started pursuing it,

654
00:22:22.308 --> 00:22:23.341
because I was inspired by seeing

655
00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:25.454
somebody from my own country, my own age.

656
00:22:25.454 --> 00:22:27.608
And I pursued it with everything I got.

657
00:22:27.608 --> 00:22:30.702
And at a certain point I just realized,

658
00:22:30.702 --> 00:22:32.279
I wanna live here and do this full time.

659
00:22:32.279 --> 00:22:34.232
This is the greatest thing I've ever come across.

660
00:22:34.232 --> 00:22:37.603
And becoming happy was my first priority.

661
00:22:37.603 --> 00:22:39.437
Because really, when it all comes down to it,

662
00:22:39.437 --> 00:22:40.407
why are we doing anything?

663
00:22:40.407 --> 00:22:41.527
We wanna actually become happy,

664
00:22:41.527 --> 00:22:43.351
and become very complete inside.

665
00:22:43.351 --> 00:22:45.271
So I put my full focus on the whole thing.

666
00:22:45.271 --> 00:22:46.488
And I was very, very grateful.

667
00:22:46.488 --> 00:22:48.641
The university saw my passion, and they said,

668
00:22:48.641 --> 00:22:50.668
"Please stay here and just help us out for a year or two."

669
00:22:50.668 --> 00:22:51.745
And I did that.

670
00:22:51.745 --> 00:22:53.356
And after a while I stressed my interest

671
00:22:53.356 --> 00:22:55.041
that I really would like to become a Oneness guide,

672
00:22:55.041 --> 00:22:56.300
that means everything to me.

673
00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.105
And they said, "Yes, please, welcome to this."

674
00:22:59.105 --> 00:23:00.876
And so I've been doing it ever since.

675
00:23:00.876 --> 00:23:02.763
And it's cool, I can tell you this much.

676
00:23:02.763 --> 00:23:04.364
Mother Teresa said the coolest quote

677
00:23:04.364 --> 00:23:06.981
that I can really agree to now at this point.

678
00:23:06.981 --> 00:23:10.386
She said, "A life not lived in service

679
00:23:10.386 --> 00:23:12.616
"is a life not truly lived at all."

680
00:23:12.616 --> 00:23:14.163
And I totally agree with that.

681
00:23:14.163 --> 00:23:16.499
It's to actually live a life where

682
00:23:16.499 --> 00:23:19.347
your whole passion is trying to help to live for a vision

683
00:23:19.347 --> 00:23:20.808
is the coolest thing.

684
00:23:20.808 --> 00:23:22.696
And so that's why I really appreciated

685
00:23:22.696 --> 00:23:23.932
being at the Oneness University,

686
00:23:23.932 --> 00:23:26.130
because not only are you growing spiritually

687
00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:28.828
and really flowering as a human being,

688
00:23:28.828 --> 00:23:30.333
but your whole focus is actually

689
00:23:30.333 --> 00:23:32.061
doing something greater than yourself.

690
00:23:32.061 --> 00:23:33.687
That's really cool.

691
00:23:33.687 --> 00:23:34.479
<v Woman>And that is,</v>

692
00:23:34.479 --> 00:23:37.379
it seems that your generation,

693
00:23:37.379 --> 00:23:40.769
your age and younger really seem to

694
00:23:40.769 --> 00:23:45.171
almost have been born into that new paradigm of thinking

695
00:23:45.171 --> 00:23:47.932
much more so than, say, my generation,

696
00:23:47.932 --> 00:23:49.959
or my father's generation.

697
00:23:49.959 --> 00:23:53.192
And so looking at it for a moment from that perspective,

698
00:23:53.192 --> 00:23:56.263
you see every kind of person coming through in India

699
00:23:56.263 --> 00:23:57.842
to the Oneness University.

700
00:23:57.842 --> 00:23:59.750
You travel all over the United States

701
00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:03.473
and elsewhere, and you share this experience with people.

702
00:24:03.473 --> 00:24:06.642
What do you notice in terms of the receptivity

703
00:24:06.642 --> 00:24:09.467
in the young versus the middle-aged, the old?

704
00:24:10.897 --> 00:24:12.612
Can you even look at it that way,

705
00:24:12.612 --> 00:24:14.745
or is it so individual?

706
00:24:14.745 --> 00:24:16.707
<v ->First of all, it's definitely so individual.</v>

707
00:24:18.496 --> 00:24:21.183
One thing I could tell you is statistically speaking,

708
00:24:21.183 --> 00:24:24.824
it seems to be 70% women

709
00:24:24.824 --> 00:24:27.492
of 40 and on up.

710
00:24:27.492 --> 00:24:29.155
That seems to be the core group.

711
00:24:29.155 --> 00:24:31.513
And then the youthful generation

712
00:24:31.513 --> 00:24:33.423
definitely comes in a big way, too.

713
00:24:34.655 --> 00:24:36.341
It's just it's such a big mixed bag,

714
00:24:36.341 --> 00:24:37.524
that's the best way to say it.

715
00:24:37.524 --> 00:24:38.452
<v Woman>Yeah.</v>

716
00:24:38.452 --> 00:24:40.852
<v ->But each country also has its own dynamic as well.</v>

717
00:24:40.852 --> 00:24:42.421
<v Woman>Yes, I would think so.</v>

718
00:24:42.421 --> 00:24:45.054
And so really the last on board

719
00:24:45.054 --> 00:24:47.679
are the ones who have maybe a little more challenge

720
00:24:47.679 --> 00:24:49.546
with finding their way there to begin with,

721
00:24:49.546 --> 00:24:54.056
might be the western male, older western male oftentimes.

722
00:24:54.056 --> 00:24:54.867
<v ->That's true.</v>

723
00:24:54.867 --> 00:24:55.849
<v Woman>They're kinda locked down</v>

724
00:24:55.849 --> 00:24:57.385
into what they're trying to do.

725
00:24:57.385 --> 00:24:58.260
<v ->In the USA, at least,</v>

726
00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.443
I don't know if this is global or not,

727
00:24:59.443 --> 00:25:00.861
but you had the '60s.

728
00:25:00.861 --> 00:25:02.728
And the '60s onwards spawned

729
00:25:02.728 --> 00:25:05.310
an entire generation of spiritual seekers.

730
00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:08.925
So I would have to say that core group is still around,

731
00:25:08.925 --> 00:25:12.094
and that definitely comprised of many people who come,

732
00:25:12.094 --> 00:25:14.214
is these seeking their whole life saying,

733
00:25:14.214 --> 00:25:15.794
"Look, I've seen it done to all these other people,

734
00:25:15.794 --> 00:25:17.096
"I want it done to me."

735
00:25:17.096 --> 00:25:18.013
So you have that,

736
00:25:18.013 --> 00:25:20.303
which is a really bedrock of spirituality

737
00:25:20.303 --> 00:25:24.112
is the people who've been around for 20 or 30 years.

738
00:25:24.112 --> 00:25:27.589
But the upcoming generations is there too.

739
00:25:27.589 --> 00:25:28.944
And you can really see it.

740
00:25:30.634 --> 00:25:32.485
A lot of young kids are now coming, young, young kids.

741
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:34.676
The questions they ask

742
00:25:34.676 --> 00:25:36.660
and the insights they have are profound.

743
00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.592
<v Woman>To me this is so exciting.</v>

744
00:25:38.592 --> 00:25:40.618
With the various people that I interview

745
00:25:40.618 --> 00:25:43.945
the one thing that probably thrills me more than anything

746
00:25:43.945 --> 00:25:45.939
is the younger generations,

747
00:25:45.939 --> 00:25:48.115
right down to little kids right now.

748
00:25:48.115 --> 00:25:50.324
Because that is our future.

749
00:25:50.324 --> 00:25:52.212
And the way I view life,

750
00:25:52.212 --> 00:25:55.614
we keep coming back around, that is us,

751
00:25:55.614 --> 00:25:57.661
that is our future quite literally,

752
00:25:57.661 --> 00:25:59.305
not just the planet's future.

753
00:25:59.305 --> 00:26:02.024
And to see this flowering of consciousness in them

754
00:26:02.024 --> 00:26:03.731
shows us it's here now.

755
00:26:03.731 --> 00:26:05.406
<v ->It's here, that's very true.</v>

756
00:26:05.406 --> 00:26:09.405
<v Woman>And so this place that you live</v>

757
00:26:09.405 --> 00:26:12.999
is one of the most stunning buildings,

758
00:26:12.999 --> 00:26:16.171
temples, universities I have ever seen.

759
00:26:16.171 --> 00:26:17.927
I really do want to take the time

760
00:26:17.927 --> 00:26:19.549
and go there at some point.

761
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:21.170
And had I known it was right there,

762
00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:23.345
and had really understood the implications of it

763
00:26:23.345 --> 00:26:26.129
when Stuart and I were in India a few years ago,

764
00:26:26.129 --> 00:26:27.165
I would have stopped by.

765
00:26:27.165 --> 00:26:29.319
I had an incredible experience

766
00:26:29.319 --> 00:26:31.335
at the Sri Aurobindo community there

767
00:26:31.335 --> 00:26:32.593
at the Matru Mandir,

768
00:26:32.593 --> 00:26:34.726
the giant golden sphere there,

769
00:26:34.726 --> 00:26:38.831
which was, the state of consciousness you can go to

770
00:26:38.831 --> 00:26:41.722
within minutes there was so profound.

771
00:26:41.722 --> 00:26:44.869
It's been my most preferred experience

772
00:26:44.869 --> 00:26:46.352
in a dwelling thus far.

773
00:26:46.352 --> 00:26:50.511
However, let's talk about this Oneness University.

774
00:26:50.511 --> 00:26:54.106
This is much more complex in the architecture.

775
00:26:54.106 --> 00:26:55.781
And you and I were talking off-camera

776
00:26:55.781 --> 00:26:57.807
about what this architecture represents,

777
00:26:57.807 --> 00:26:59.759
if we could look at it from a bird's eye point of view.

778
00:26:59.759 --> 00:27:00.815
So let's talk about it.

779
00:27:00.815 --> 00:27:01.808
<v ->Sure.</v>

780
00:27:01.808 --> 00:27:04.186
The one thing about this work

781
00:27:04.186 --> 00:27:07.374
is basically this work was never really about

782
00:27:08.471 --> 00:27:09.973
the intellect of a human being.

783
00:27:09.973 --> 00:27:12.481
It wasn't like, "Let's think about what we can do,

784
00:27:12.481 --> 00:27:14.851
"and let's think of good ideas," things like that.

785
00:27:14.851 --> 00:27:17.590
I can honestly say this whole, entire work that's happening

786
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:19.478
is something that's literally been revealed

787
00:27:19.478 --> 00:27:21.727
in a very literal way, actually.

788
00:27:21.727 --> 00:27:24.276
Even if how you see we operate the university,

789
00:27:24.276 --> 00:27:26.186
we're extremely spontaneous.

790
00:27:26.186 --> 00:27:28.075
We're only just feeling what feels right,

791
00:27:28.075 --> 00:27:30.037
and it just all happens very spontaneously.

792
00:27:30.037 --> 00:27:31.444
It's very unique.

793
00:27:31.444 --> 00:27:32.746
It's not like western things

794
00:27:32.746 --> 00:27:33.941
where you have a board meeting

795
00:27:33.941 --> 00:27:35.444
and decide what you're gonna do for the next six months,

796
00:27:35.444 --> 00:27:37.599
and lay out an intellectual plan.

797
00:27:37.599 --> 00:27:39.060
How this thing has happened was,

798
00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.258
in this phenomenon, 1989,

799
00:27:41.258 --> 00:27:42.740
was that so many people moved into

800
00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.446
such vast states of consciousness,

801
00:27:44.446 --> 00:27:48.873
I mean, big states, they were becoming quite big mystics.

802
00:27:48.873 --> 00:27:50.238
When you move into these very high states

803
00:27:50.238 --> 00:27:52.591
you can very easily see things mystically,

804
00:27:52.591 --> 00:27:54.185
and a lot of times what you call the divine

805
00:27:54.185 --> 00:27:55.536
or cosmic consciousness

806
00:27:55.536 --> 00:27:57.733
would show you of things to come.

807
00:27:57.733 --> 00:27:59.482
Literally thousands of people,

808
00:27:59.482 --> 00:28:01.040
and very literally thousands,

809
00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.237
kept on writing to us over and over,

810
00:28:03.237 --> 00:28:05.881
sharing the visions of what they're seeing is gonna happen

811
00:28:05.881 --> 00:28:08.239
for the next 10 years, 15 years, 20 years,

812
00:28:08.239 --> 00:28:10.671
even up to 100 years ahead.

813
00:28:10.671 --> 00:28:13.092
So we had literally the experiences

814
00:28:13.092 --> 00:28:14.690
from so many people,

815
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:16.922
and guess what, they all overlapped.

816
00:28:16.922 --> 00:28:18.968
They're all almost similar experiences.

817
00:28:18.968 --> 00:28:20.473
It's like a timeline was presented to us

818
00:28:20.473 --> 00:28:22.723
way back when, very literally.

819
00:28:22.723 --> 00:28:25.028
And what many, many people were saying was

820
00:28:25.028 --> 00:28:28.494
there's some kind of meditational hall or structure

821
00:28:28.494 --> 00:28:31.000
that causes transformation to the species,

822
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.209
and they see thousands and thousands

823
00:28:33.209 --> 00:28:35.203
of actual enlightened beings

824
00:28:35.203 --> 00:28:37.197
sitting in what they call samadhi,

825
00:28:37.197 --> 00:28:40.441
or extraordinarily deep state of consciousness,

826
00:28:40.441 --> 00:28:41.581
sitting in it.

827
00:28:41.581 --> 00:28:44.759
And that that was powering the deeksha phenomenon

828
00:28:44.759 --> 00:28:46.381
of deeksha givers across the planet.

829
00:28:46.381 --> 00:28:47.617
This was seen in visions,

830
00:28:47.617 --> 00:28:49.912
this was all things that was seen.

831
00:28:49.912 --> 00:28:51.842
So people were drawing sketches of the temple

832
00:28:51.842 --> 00:28:53.292
all across the planet.

833
00:28:53.292 --> 00:28:54.583
We never even thought of any kind of concept

834
00:28:54.583 --> 00:28:56.620
to build a temple, nothing like that at all.

835
00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.572
It was that people saw this,

836
00:28:58.572 --> 00:29:00.130
and they kept on saying this.

837
00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:01.804
Even when we consulted with an architect

838
00:29:01.804 --> 00:29:04.631
who was the top Vastu architect of India,

839
00:29:04.631 --> 00:29:06.060
we consulted with him,

840
00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.086
he for some reason was able to sketch

841
00:29:08.086 --> 00:29:09.772
the whole thing in less than a week's time.

842
00:29:09.772 --> 00:29:10.977
He said he just flew through it.

843
00:29:10.977 --> 00:29:12.012
<v Woman>That's amazing.</v>

844
00:29:12.012 --> 00:29:13.003
<v ->Yeah, it was very strange.</v>

845
00:29:13.003 --> 00:29:13.760
<v Woman>Very strange.</v>

846
00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:14.486
<v ->Exactly.</v>

847
00:29:14.486 --> 00:29:17.568
So many, many people when they saw the temple

848
00:29:17.568 --> 00:29:20.267
would go into very emotional states because they say,

849
00:29:20.267 --> 00:29:22.891
"I have been seeing this in my meditations

850
00:29:22.891 --> 00:29:25.429
"for 20 years now, 30 years now."

851
00:29:25.429 --> 00:29:28.085
So it was something that you could just simply say

852
00:29:28.085 --> 00:29:31.050
was a part of how the universe or the divine

853
00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:32.618
is expressing this phenomena.

854
00:29:32.618 --> 00:29:33.962
That's the best way to say it.

855
00:29:33.962 --> 00:29:34.975
Because it was never a concept,

856
00:29:34.975 --> 00:29:36.565
it was never like, "Oh, let's build a meditation hall,"

857
00:29:36.565 --> 00:29:37.599
nothing like that.

858
00:29:37.599 --> 00:29:40.607
It was just told over and over, this is to happen.

859
00:29:40.607 --> 00:29:42.385
And the meditation hall itself

860
00:29:42.385 --> 00:29:43.708
was all built off of donations.

861
00:29:43.708 --> 00:29:45.393
People just simply said,

862
00:29:45.393 --> 00:29:46.673
"We have to help humanity."

863
00:29:46.673 --> 00:29:48.241
And they all, thousands and thousands of people,

864
00:29:48.241 --> 00:29:49.829
just donated whatever they had,

865
00:29:49.829 --> 00:29:51.536
money that they could spare,

866
00:29:51.536 --> 00:29:53.158
and they built a temple from that.

867
00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:55.984
<v Woman>Was it contracted by the local workers,</v>

868
00:29:55.984 --> 00:29:58.247
or did some of them also donate their time?

869
00:29:59.714 --> 00:30:02.404
The complexity of this structure is just amazing.

870
00:30:02.404 --> 00:30:03.364
<v ->Yeah, it is amazing.</v>

871
00:30:03.364 --> 00:30:04.889
<v Woman>I mean, you think it would have cost</v>

872
00:30:04.889 --> 00:30:08.015
$50 million to build such a facility.

873
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:11.403
<v ->Because of the uniqueness of how this was built</v>

874
00:30:11.403 --> 00:30:13.216
it had to have been done in a professional way.

875
00:30:15.083 --> 00:30:16.891
We were fortunate enough to come across

876
00:30:16.891 --> 00:30:18.032
the top architect,

877
00:30:18.032 --> 00:30:19.248
and I believe he was the architect

878
00:30:19.248 --> 00:30:21.424
for Sri Aurobindo's design as well.

879
00:30:21.424 --> 00:30:22.843
I believe it was the same architect.

880
00:30:22.843 --> 00:30:24.955
So he was one of the most famous guys in India

881
00:30:24.955 --> 00:30:26.852
as far as Vasta architecture.

882
00:30:26.852 --> 00:30:30.906
So basically he had his own company

883
00:30:30.906 --> 00:30:32.613
that would actually build it, et cetera.

884
00:30:32.613 --> 00:30:33.935
So the strange thing about it, though,

885
00:30:33.935 --> 00:30:36.111
was it normally takes 15 years to build something like that.

886
00:30:36.111 --> 00:30:38.831
The whole thing finished in eight or nine years.

887
00:30:38.831 --> 00:30:41.338
It was very strange, the whole circumstances.

888
00:30:42.809 --> 00:30:45.487
The whole vision of the work's really simple, actually.

889
00:30:45.487 --> 00:30:49.369
There was an ancient prophecy by a Buddhist saint,

890
00:30:49.369 --> 00:30:51.236
I think literally a thousand years ago.

891
00:30:51.236 --> 00:30:53.571
He was in a very high state, so he was a mystic.

892
00:30:53.571 --> 00:30:55.406
He was able to see things that were going to come.

893
00:30:55.406 --> 00:30:59.897
He said, actually, "When big iron birds fly in the sky,

894
00:30:59.897 --> 00:31:03.556
"man achieves awakening in under three minutes."

895
00:31:03.556 --> 00:31:05.988
Now the one thing that many, many people have seen

896
00:31:05.988 --> 00:31:08.656
is that there's a shift that's about to happen

897
00:31:08.656 --> 00:31:11.130
that meets what's called critical mass.

898
00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:12.922
There's enough awakened people on the planet

899
00:31:12.922 --> 00:31:15.418
that you could then transfer the state to another person

900
00:31:15.418 --> 00:31:16.654
just like that.

901
00:31:16.654 --> 00:31:18.809
And it causes the actual shift in the brain.

902
00:31:18.809 --> 00:31:20.654
So what's happening is

903
00:31:20.654 --> 00:31:22.552
all the work we've done for the last 20 years

904
00:31:22.552 --> 00:31:23.843
has been preparation.

905
00:31:23.843 --> 00:31:26.575
We've just been preparing the groundwork,

906
00:31:26.575 --> 00:31:28.440
sort of like a farmer would prepare a field.

907
00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.741
We've been preparing the soil

908
00:31:29.741 --> 00:31:31.545
because the rains were coming.

909
00:31:31.545 --> 00:31:34.104
The phenomenon by Amma and Bhagavan are releasing,

910
00:31:34.104 --> 00:31:36.440
are releasing in a very, very big way now.

911
00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.490
And it's pushing the critical mass numbers as we speak.

912
00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.218
The whole, entire vision was to create

913
00:31:41.218 --> 00:31:44.610
0.001% of the species to make them awakened.

914
00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:47.603
That makes a chain reaction to happen to the whole species,

915
00:31:47.603 --> 00:31:49.335
because one awakened person

916
00:31:49.335 --> 00:31:51.298
affects 100,000 people.

917
00:31:51.298 --> 00:31:53.111
So all you need is 70,000 people

918
00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:54.732
to affect 7 billion.

919
00:31:54.732 --> 00:31:55.735
<v Woman>But from what I'm seeing</v>

920
00:31:55.735 --> 00:31:58.188
just of the little flags on the map

921
00:31:58.188 --> 00:32:00.951
of the locations in India alone,

922
00:32:00.951 --> 00:32:04.171
you're talking about many millions.

923
00:32:04.171 --> 00:32:06.539
<v ->Yeah. Basically, exactly.</v>

924
00:32:06.539 --> 00:32:08.428
If you disperse

925
00:32:08.428 --> 00:32:10.912
there's something called phase transition.

926
00:32:10.912 --> 00:32:13.781
Basically if you take water and you put it in the freezer,

927
00:32:13.781 --> 00:32:15.630
the water, when it's turning to ice,

928
00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:17.966
it doesn't slowly turn to ice at all, actually.

929
00:32:17.966 --> 00:32:19.810
Little teeny pockets of particles

930
00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:21.624
start happening, of crystals.

931
00:32:21.624 --> 00:32:24.140
And then spontaneously when critical masses happen

932
00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:25.666
the whole thing becomes ice.

933
00:32:25.666 --> 00:32:27.594
Same thing with actually changing

934
00:32:27.594 --> 00:32:29.282
consciousness in the whole species.

935
00:32:29.282 --> 00:32:31.478
You just take about 70,000 people,

936
00:32:31.478 --> 00:32:32.908
and they actually have to become awakened.

937
00:32:32.908 --> 00:32:34.816
They have to actually be an awakened being.

938
00:32:34.816 --> 00:32:37.334
But basically when they're dispersed across the planet,

939
00:32:37.334 --> 00:32:39.222
it starts a chain reaction.

940
00:32:39.222 --> 00:32:41.580
The whole purpose of the Oneness Temple

941
00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.019
was that a portion,

942
00:32:43.019 --> 00:32:45.943
about 7000 of those people just rotating in and out,

943
00:32:45.943 --> 00:32:47.200
would be in the meditation.

944
00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.320
These are actual awakened people,

945
00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.824
not just somebody coming to meditate,

946
00:32:49.824 --> 00:32:51.233
actual awakened people.

947
00:32:51.233 --> 00:32:53.526
That creates a battery pack.

948
00:32:53.526 --> 00:32:55.562
Then if you're somebody like Amma and Bhagavan,

949
00:32:55.562 --> 00:32:57.307
you have the ability to take that

950
00:32:57.307 --> 00:32:58.864
and push it through the 70,000

951
00:32:58.864 --> 00:33:00.347
that's across the planet.

952
00:33:00.347 --> 00:33:02.832
So when they go to give the deeksha,

953
00:33:02.832 --> 00:33:05.264
it could easily cause a shift in under three minutes.

954
00:33:05.264 --> 00:33:06.181
That's why Bhagavan says

955
00:33:06.181 --> 00:33:07.973
we should respect this man's prophecy.

956
00:33:07.973 --> 00:33:09.455
We should make it come true.

957
00:33:09.455 --> 00:33:13.040
So the whole goal for this time period, basically,

958
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.066
is that everyone has spoken about

959
00:33:15.066 --> 00:33:16.837
a great awakening happening to the species,

960
00:33:16.837 --> 00:33:18.073
and there's so many organizations,

961
00:33:18.073 --> 00:33:19.661
so many great masters, so many great beings,

962
00:33:19.661 --> 00:33:21.326
all pushing towards the same thing.

963
00:33:21.326 --> 00:33:22.947
It's building the critical mass.

964
00:33:22.947 --> 00:33:25.570
We should be seeing this year onwards

965
00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:27.951
awakening being very spontaneously happening.

966
00:33:27.951 --> 00:33:29.699
And that's what the whole world of deeksha is.

967
00:33:29.699 --> 00:33:31.629
It's supposed to not have any boundaries.

968
00:33:31.629 --> 00:33:33.315
A person just simply is in a good state,

969
00:33:33.315 --> 00:33:34.232
they transfer it,

970
00:33:34.232 --> 00:33:35.716
the person pops into a good state,

971
00:33:35.716 --> 00:33:38.392
they transfer it, and so on, so forth.

972
00:33:38.392 --> 00:33:41.218
<v Woman>So how available is this globally?</v>

973
00:33:41.218 --> 00:33:43.640
Obviously it's saturated throughout India,

974
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.794
but what about the other countries?

975
00:33:45.794 --> 00:33:47.757
<v ->It's basically very popular</v>

976
00:33:47.757 --> 00:33:50.040
in almost every single country in the whole planet.

977
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.416
There's most likely around 80,000 to 100,000

978
00:33:53.416 --> 00:33:56.488
deeksha givers all across the whole planet,

979
00:33:56.488 --> 00:33:59.698
and there's about 4000 people who can make deeksha givers,

980
00:33:59.698 --> 00:34:01.180
we call them Oneness trainers.

981
00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.060
So very literally anywhere you are in the whole planet

982
00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:05.607
you could very easily find somebody

983
00:34:05.607 --> 00:34:07.197
pretty much right down your street,

984
00:34:07.197 --> 00:34:09.041
and they could make you a deeksha giver.

985
00:34:09.041 --> 00:34:09.938
And then you could just walk around

986
00:34:09.938 --> 00:34:12.434
giving deeksha to anybody you want, very literally.

987
00:34:12.434 --> 00:34:15.100
<v Woman>And so that can happen in your own neighborhood,</v>

988
00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.915
you don't have to go away for three weeks to India.

989
00:34:17.915 --> 00:34:21.734
However, I want to experience that building,

990
00:34:21.734 --> 00:34:23.654
I wanna experience that temple.

991
00:34:26.074 --> 00:34:27.483
Is it complete now?

992
00:34:27.483 --> 00:34:30.969
<v ->Yeah, I'd say it's 99% complete. Just small polishes.</v>

993
00:34:30.969 --> 00:34:32.858
<v Woman>I was reading that it is</v>

994
00:34:32.858 --> 00:34:36.558
the largest structure of its kind

995
00:34:36.558 --> 00:34:40.558
with no supporting internal pillars in Asia.

996
00:34:40.558 --> 00:34:42.170
<v ->Yep, exactly.</v>

997
00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.568
<v Woman>That's kind of Rudolf Steinerian,</v>

998
00:34:44.568 --> 00:34:48.959
the homes that he'd built, his personal home.

999
00:34:48.959 --> 00:34:51.236
Again, everyone was just marveling

1000
00:34:51.236 --> 00:34:53.060
at the fact that there was no apparent means

1001
00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.683
of internal support for this gigantic structure.

1002
00:34:55.683 --> 00:34:57.144
And this is what you're looking at here.

1003
00:34:57.144 --> 00:34:57.838
<v ->Exactly.</v>

1004
00:34:57.838 --> 00:34:59.277
And the whole purpose of that

1005
00:34:59.277 --> 00:35:01.677
is basically to where you can have

1006
00:35:01.677 --> 00:35:03.842
thousands of people all sitting in meditation,

1007
00:35:03.842 --> 00:35:05.879
and the energy would be totally

1008
00:35:05.879 --> 00:35:07.810
locked in together conducive.

1009
00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:09.377
Because think about this.

1010
00:35:09.377 --> 00:35:10.936
We all go visit,

1011
00:35:10.936 --> 00:35:13.176
any time there's an awakened being to America,

1012
00:35:13.176 --> 00:35:15.553
we all go and visit and get the blessings from them.

1013
00:35:15.553 --> 00:35:18.573
Could you imagine going to a temple

1014
00:35:18.573 --> 00:35:21.686
and seeing 4000 of those kinds of beings

1015
00:35:21.686 --> 00:35:24.139
sitting in the deepest states of meditation.

1016
00:35:24.139 --> 00:35:25.099
Like, you couldn't imagine that.

1017
00:35:25.099 --> 00:35:26.177
In fact I don't know any place

1018
00:35:26.177 --> 00:35:27.595
that exists like that, per se.

1019
00:35:27.595 --> 00:35:28.471
Maybe there is, I don't know.

1020
00:35:28.471 --> 00:35:29.526
<v Woman>Sounds like Heaven to me.</v>

1021
00:35:29.526 --> 00:35:30.263
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>

1022
00:35:30.263 --> 00:35:31.659
It's a hardcore kinda thing.

1023
00:35:31.659 --> 00:35:33.493
So that's what the whole structure is built for.

1024
00:35:33.493 --> 00:35:34.346
A lot of people see it,

1025
00:35:34.346 --> 00:35:35.925
they don't understand the whole purpose of it.

1026
00:35:35.925 --> 00:35:37.471
It's actually just for that.

1027
00:35:37.471 --> 00:35:38.955
<v Woman>And when you're looking at it,</v>

1028
00:35:38.955 --> 00:35:40.726
and when people look at this picture,

1029
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.505
you were explaining that the architect

1030
00:35:43.505 --> 00:35:46.386
built it so that it was this sacred yantra

1031
00:35:46.386 --> 00:35:48.945
built three-dimensionally.

1032
00:35:48.945 --> 00:35:50.940
And that's why such unique features.

1033
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.135
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>

1034
00:35:52.135 --> 00:35:54.471
<v Woman>So the sacred geometry is embedded,</v>

1035
00:35:54.471 --> 00:35:56.934
obviously for the expansion of consciousness.

1036
00:35:56.934 --> 00:36:01.479
<v ->It even has literally a moat of water that goes around it.</v>

1037
00:36:01.479 --> 00:36:04.955
In fact, the architect, because of his studying in Vastu,

1038
00:36:04.955 --> 00:36:06.725
was explaining that when you literally

1039
00:36:06.725 --> 00:36:08.048
surround something by water,

1040
00:36:08.048 --> 00:36:12.922
it breaks off the interfering energies or frequencies.

1041
00:36:12.922 --> 00:36:15.056
So the way it's built,

1042
00:36:15.056 --> 00:36:17.711
if you ever had a chance to speak with the architect,

1043
00:36:17.711 --> 00:36:19.301
it's built in such a way

1044
00:36:19.301 --> 00:36:20.539
that what's supposed to happen,

1045
00:36:20.539 --> 00:36:23.098
how we have our campus set up for the near future, actually,

1046
00:36:23.098 --> 00:36:26.596
and if you come in a couple months, or six months right now,

1047
00:36:26.596 --> 00:36:28.751
you would actually see what I'm about to speak to you about.

1048
00:36:28.751 --> 00:36:31.557
Very literally thousands of people all day long

1049
00:36:31.557 --> 00:36:34.617
would be walking and literally walking up the steps.

1050
00:36:34.617 --> 00:36:37.529
As they walk up each spiral of the steps and walk around,

1051
00:36:37.529 --> 00:36:40.047
it activates a different chakra, actually.

1052
00:36:40.047 --> 00:36:42.319
The whole thing is built to actually turn on

1053
00:36:42.319 --> 00:36:43.641
the whole entire engine.

1054
00:36:43.641 --> 00:36:44.835
You get up to the top floor,

1055
00:36:44.835 --> 00:36:45.668
and you just would walk around

1056
00:36:45.668 --> 00:36:47.193
the top floor maybe three times,

1057
00:36:47.193 --> 00:36:50.262
and you'd walk all the way back down and leave.

1058
00:36:50.262 --> 00:36:51.454
When you have thousands of people

1059
00:36:51.454 --> 00:36:53.876
who are in these very high states meditating,

1060
00:36:53.876 --> 00:36:57.226
most likely a mass of irreversible shift in conscious

1061
00:36:57.226 --> 00:36:59.060
would happen just by doing that.

1062
00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.548
And that was what was seen in so many visions from people,

1063
00:37:02.548 --> 00:37:04.606
was that they saw there was this temple,

1064
00:37:04.606 --> 00:37:07.005
and millions of people all day long were going there,

1065
00:37:07.005 --> 00:37:09.213
and they were actually becoming awakened beings.

1066
00:37:09.213 --> 00:37:11.773
So that's actually our whole preparation for the temple was

1067
00:37:11.773 --> 00:37:13.096
we've had to prepare everything,

1068
00:37:13.096 --> 00:37:16.242
because we know as soon as the green light goes on

1069
00:37:16.242 --> 00:37:17.502
we have to be ready for the fact

1070
00:37:17.502 --> 00:37:19.112
that many people would come

1071
00:37:19.112 --> 00:37:20.734
literally to have this experience.

1072
00:37:20.734 --> 00:37:22.568
So that's actually the whole...

1073
00:37:22.568 --> 00:37:24.754
<v Woman>It almost sounds like a generator.</v>

1074
00:37:24.754 --> 00:37:26.236
<v ->It's a generator. That's exactly what it is.</v>

1075
00:37:26.236 --> 00:37:27.300
<v Woman>I mean, I can feel it</v>

1076
00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.121
when you're talking about it.

1077
00:37:29.121 --> 00:37:31.030
<v ->And it sits on the ley lines of our planet.</v>

1078
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:32.150
You should actually understand this,

1079
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:34.837
it was actually built in a very specific land,

1080
00:37:34.837 --> 00:37:37.760
in a very specific position to literally react.

1081
00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.659
And its purpose is actually to be around

1082
00:37:39.659 --> 00:37:41.366
for the next thousand years.

1083
00:37:41.366 --> 00:37:44.224
When you have beings like Amma and Bhagvan,

1084
00:37:44.224 --> 00:37:45.569
they're what you call avatars.

1085
00:37:45.569 --> 00:37:47.233
But when you have beings like that,

1086
00:37:47.233 --> 00:37:48.736
they don't look at small things.

1087
00:37:48.736 --> 00:37:50.177
They're actually looking at a species,

1088
00:37:50.177 --> 00:37:52.500
and they're concerned about it flowering and sustaining

1089
00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.975
in harmony with this planet's surroundings.

1090
00:37:54.975 --> 00:37:56.640
So they actually look long-term.

1091
00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:57.803
The whole purpose of the structure

1092
00:37:57.803 --> 00:37:59.851
is this would be maintained with its purpose

1093
00:37:59.851 --> 00:38:01.268
of people meditating in it

1094
00:38:01.268 --> 00:38:03.445
for the next thousand years or so.

1095
00:38:03.445 --> 00:38:06.004
And the reason why, very literally the reason why,

1096
00:38:06.004 --> 00:38:09.791
is that any time throughout our next thousand years,

1097
00:38:09.791 --> 00:38:11.530
any society that starts dipping

1098
00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:13.832
in lower states of consciousness from some tragedy,

1099
00:38:13.832 --> 00:38:16.351
something, lower energies, who knows.

1100
00:38:16.351 --> 00:38:18.335
Because you have a structure like that

1101
00:38:18.335 --> 00:38:19.582
on the ley lines of the planet,

1102
00:38:19.582 --> 00:38:22.239
it creates such a field that literally within

1103
00:38:22.239 --> 00:38:25.203
that lifetime or generation of that society,

1104
00:38:25.203 --> 00:38:26.609
they would naturally raise that back

1105
00:38:26.609 --> 00:38:28.165
into high states of consciousness.

1106
00:38:28.165 --> 00:38:30.161
So it's a fail safe to make sure the species

1107
00:38:30.161 --> 00:38:32.336
doesn't dip into lower states.

1108
00:38:32.336 --> 00:38:34.469
<v Woman>What a beautiful vision,</v>

1109
00:38:34.469 --> 00:38:36.496
and stunning accomplishment.

1110
00:38:36.496 --> 00:38:37.914
<v ->It's cool, it's definitely cool.</v>

1111
00:38:37.914 --> 00:38:39.224
When you go there you feel it.

1112
00:38:40.404 --> 00:38:41.822
<v Woman>You can feel it looking at the pictures</v>

1113
00:38:41.822 --> 00:38:43.753
and just sitting with you as you're explaining it,

1114
00:38:43.753 --> 00:38:45.684
you can feel it.

1115
00:38:45.684 --> 00:38:47.432
And so this is your life now.

1116
00:38:47.432 --> 00:38:48.957
<v ->Yeah, it's what I do full time.</v>

1117
00:38:48.957 --> 00:38:50.334
<v Woman>Well, you look pretty darn happy.</v>

1118
00:38:50.334 --> 00:38:51.698
<v ->It's a lot of fun.</v>

1119
00:38:51.698 --> 00:38:53.725
<v Woman>You were looking for happiness, you found it.</v>

1120
00:38:53.725 --> 00:38:56.914
And how is it living in India at the facility now?

1121
00:38:56.914 --> 00:38:59.496
As coming from the east coast?

1122
00:38:59.496 --> 00:39:00.775
<v ->Yeah, I'd have to definitely say</v>

1123
00:39:00.775 --> 00:39:02.077
there was an adjustment period

1124
00:39:02.077 --> 00:39:05.308
of the precision and how we all

1125
00:39:05.308 --> 00:39:07.238
base everything on time here.

1126
00:39:07.238 --> 00:39:10.066
Everything is by the minute, exact and precise.

1127
00:39:10.066 --> 00:39:12.667
So in India it's quite different.

1128
00:39:12.667 --> 00:39:14.631
Everything sorta happens spontaneously.

1129
00:39:14.631 --> 00:39:16.306
It's a very vast different thing.

1130
00:39:16.306 --> 00:39:18.801
Once I got through that, once that kinda broke in me,

1131
00:39:18.801 --> 00:39:20.263
which was pretty much the greatest blessing

1132
00:39:20.263 --> 00:39:21.499
if that ever breaks in a person,

1133
00:39:21.499 --> 00:39:23.536
because they can really take any situation.

1134
00:39:23.536 --> 00:39:25.244
I love it, absolutely love India.

1135
00:39:25.244 --> 00:39:28.420
And it's home now, so it's fantastic.

1136
00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:29.981
And I'm a person,

1137
00:39:31.565 --> 00:39:33.964
the growth in consciousness is a very endless thing.

1138
00:39:33.964 --> 00:39:35.565
I'm a person who's very naturally

1139
00:39:35.565 --> 00:39:39.297
somebody who is very passionate to continue to grow.

1140
00:39:39.297 --> 00:39:41.228
So being there, just being at the campus,

1141
00:39:41.228 --> 00:39:44.385
because it has such energy, the phenomenon's there,

1142
00:39:44.385 --> 00:39:46.977
and you have so many monks in such vastly high states,

1143
00:39:46.977 --> 00:39:48.588
and you have Sri Amma and Bhagavan there.

1144
00:39:48.588 --> 00:39:51.468
There's such energies there that even just living there,

1145
00:39:51.468 --> 00:39:53.141
it's a constant deep process

1146
00:39:53.141 --> 00:39:55.126
of deepening, and growing, and flowering.

1147
00:39:55.126 --> 00:39:56.224
So since I'm somebody

1148
00:39:56.224 --> 00:39:59.349
who's very focused on spiritual growth,

1149
00:39:59.349 --> 00:40:00.854
living there is actually a privilege to me.

1150
00:40:00.854 --> 00:40:03.509
I don't actually look at it like I'm just living there,

1151
00:40:03.509 --> 00:40:04.380
I'm actually really grateful

1152
00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:06.364
any chance I have to live there.

1153
00:40:06.364 --> 00:40:08.136
Because you're just constantly flowering and growing.

1154
00:40:08.136 --> 00:40:10.225
It's fantastic. That's all I can say.

1155
00:40:10.225 --> 00:40:11.953
<v Woman>Have you gone back to DC?</v>

1156
00:40:11.953 --> 00:40:12.732
<v ->Yes.</v>

1157
00:40:12.732 --> 00:40:13.820
<v Woman>How was that for you?</v>

1158
00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:14.877
<v ->It was wonderful.</v>

1159
00:40:14.877 --> 00:40:18.045
I tell you it was so neat is this,

1160
00:40:19.728 --> 00:40:21.314
every time I come back home

1161
00:40:21.314 --> 00:40:24.011
I find that I have more and more respect, and reverence,

1162
00:40:24.011 --> 00:40:25.376
and sacredness, and gratitude

1163
00:40:25.376 --> 00:40:27.346
towards my family and my friends.

1164
00:40:27.346 --> 00:40:29.265
I see them in such a different light.

1165
00:40:29.265 --> 00:40:32.093
It's new and neat, because spirituality,

1166
00:40:32.093 --> 00:40:33.213
so many people have some concept

1167
00:40:33.213 --> 00:40:34.780
that it's about escaping life,

1168
00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.359
it's about just being in some mystical state

1169
00:40:36.359 --> 00:40:37.414
but it's not.

1170
00:40:37.414 --> 00:40:39.474
It's about actually flowering as a human being.

1171
00:40:39.474 --> 00:40:42.418
It's about actually appreciating, and respecting,

1172
00:40:42.418 --> 00:40:44.422
and healing all your relationships.

1173
00:40:44.422 --> 00:40:46.524
It's about actually becoming a real person,

1174
00:40:46.524 --> 00:40:48.103
and owning up to what's really going on

1175
00:40:48.103 --> 00:40:50.117
with yourself and others.

1176
00:40:50.117 --> 00:40:52.027
I've noticed that my relationships

1177
00:40:52.027 --> 00:40:53.446
with my mom and my dad,

1178
00:40:53.446 --> 00:40:54.705
I'm like best friends with them now.

1179
00:40:54.705 --> 00:40:56.243
I never was like that, per se.

1180
00:40:57.806 --> 00:40:59.790
I really value all my friends and things like that.

1181
00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:01.177
Every time I come home,

1182
00:41:01.177 --> 00:41:04.723
to see things in a new light like this is so cool.

1183
00:41:04.723 --> 00:41:06.445
So it's really neat.

1184
00:41:06.445 --> 00:41:08.173
<v Woman>So any final thoughts?</v>

1185
00:41:08.173 --> 00:41:09.941
Anything you'd like to share with us

1186
00:41:09.941 --> 00:41:11.959
before we sign off here?

1187
00:41:11.959 --> 00:41:14.636
<v ->So this year what's happening,</v>

1188
00:41:14.636 --> 00:41:16.653
the reason why I'm traveling in 2012,

1189
00:41:16.653 --> 00:41:19.884
is that Sri Bhagavan is increasing this deeksha phenomenon

1190
00:41:19.884 --> 00:41:21.527
in a really, really big way.

1191
00:41:21.527 --> 00:41:23.554
And basically there are gonna be people

1192
00:41:23.554 --> 00:41:25.472
all across the planet doing something called

1193
00:41:25.472 --> 00:41:27.297
the Oneness meditation.

1194
00:41:27.297 --> 00:41:28.535
It's a form of deeksha.

1195
00:41:28.535 --> 00:41:30.507
Normally deeksha's a hands-on thing,

1196
00:41:30.507 --> 00:41:31.627
but it's a form of deeksha

1197
00:41:31.627 --> 00:41:33.291
that's given through the eyes.

1198
00:41:33.291 --> 00:41:35.019
It's a very, very powerful kind of thing.

1199
00:41:35.019 --> 00:41:36.523
Amma and Bhagavan are returning

1200
00:41:36.523 --> 00:41:38.315
to what happened in 1989.

1201
00:41:38.315 --> 00:41:39.751
They're sort of increasing it to where

1202
00:41:39.751 --> 00:41:43.079
a person's literally transmitting that experience.

1203
00:41:43.079 --> 00:41:46.418
So if you go to onenessmeditation.org,

1204
00:41:46.418 --> 00:41:47.452
I'm able to plug that?

1205
00:41:47.452 --> 00:41:48.599
<v Woman>Yeah, absolutely.</v>

1206
00:41:48.599 --> 00:41:51.241
<v ->So if you go to onenessmeditation.org,</v>

1207
00:41:51.241 --> 00:41:54.208
you'll be seeing a list of people all across the planet,

1208
00:41:54.208 --> 00:41:55.488
these are Oneness trainers,

1209
00:41:55.488 --> 00:41:58.207
who are able to actually give this Oneness meditation.

1210
00:41:58.207 --> 00:41:59.327
And I just highly suggest

1211
00:41:59.327 --> 00:42:01.514
if you're spiritual or interested in

1212
00:42:01.514 --> 00:42:03.326
any kind of growth in consciousness,

1213
00:42:03.326 --> 00:42:04.895
or just to become a happy person,

1214
00:42:04.895 --> 00:42:06.047
just go attend it.

1215
00:42:06.047 --> 00:42:07.412
All these things are free.

1216
00:42:07.412 --> 00:42:08.895
The Oneness meditation's totally free.

1217
00:42:08.895 --> 00:42:09.951
You just find out where it is,

1218
00:42:09.951 --> 00:42:11.091
you show up at the event,

1219
00:42:11.091 --> 00:42:13.107
and you just stare at the person in the eyes.

1220
00:42:13.107 --> 00:42:14.569
So as I travel around USA and Canada

1221
00:42:14.569 --> 00:42:15.956
I would also be doing this,

1222
00:42:15.956 --> 00:42:17.929
and there's many people who are gonna be doing this.

1223
00:42:17.929 --> 00:42:20.468
But it's you have a chance to really experience

1224
00:42:20.468 --> 00:42:22.643
a very, very powerful deeksha.

1225
00:42:22.643 --> 00:42:25.203
And it could very literally make you move into

1226
00:42:25.203 --> 00:42:27.293
very irreversible states of consciousness.

1227
00:42:27.293 --> 00:42:28.881
You can become a very happy human being,

1228
00:42:28.881 --> 00:42:30.280
that's the best way to say it.

1229
00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:33.021
And once the engine of spirituality starts in a big way,

1230
00:42:33.021 --> 00:42:35.293
it's an endless automatic process.

1231
00:42:35.293 --> 00:42:37.617
One shouldn't think you either make it or you don't,

1232
00:42:37.617 --> 00:42:39.377
it's more like when it kicks on,

1233
00:42:39.377 --> 00:42:41.777
every day it happens automatically.

1234
00:42:41.777 --> 00:42:43.773
So that whole purpose of the Oneness meditation

1235
00:42:43.773 --> 00:42:46.471
is to kind of turn on that engine.

1236
00:42:46.471 --> 00:42:49.116
<v Woman>Fabulous, and a neighborhood near us.</v>

1237
00:42:49.116 --> 00:42:50.694
<v ->Yes, very literally.</v>

1238
00:42:50.694 --> 00:42:51.931
<v Woman>Oh, very good.</v>

1239
00:42:51.931 --> 00:42:53.138
Thank you so much for your time

1240
00:42:53.138 --> 00:42:55.024
as you're passing through this part of the world,

1241
00:42:55.024 --> 00:42:55.964
because I know you're flying out

1242
00:42:55.964 --> 00:42:58.331
to other parts of America in a couple days.

1243
00:42:58.331 --> 00:43:01.221
And thank you for taking the time with us. Beautiful.

1244
00:43:01.221 --> 00:43:02.012
<v ->Namaste.</v>

1245
00:43:02.012 --> 00:43:03.144
<v Woman>Namaste.</v>

1246
00:43:04.622 --> 00:43:06.489
To connect with a deeksha group near you,

1247
00:43:06.489 --> 00:43:10.903
you can go to their site at diksha.com.

1248
00:43:10.903 --> 00:43:13.400
It features a worldwide directory of trainers

1249
00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.032
so you can receive the energy,

1250
00:43:15.032 --> 00:43:17.036
and also learn to share it with others.

1251
00:43:17.036 --> 00:43:18.465
If you have the opportunity

1252
00:43:18.465 --> 00:43:20.269
it's truly a sublime experience

1253
00:43:20.269 --> 00:43:22.060
to sit with Dougee when he goes into

1254
00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:23.948
his high state of consciousness.

1255
00:43:23.948 --> 00:43:26.832
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
