00:00:03.952 --> 00:00:15.652 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.652 --> 00:00:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're like me, many
of you have been following

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.490 align:middle line:84%
the evolution of Gregg Braden's
work for the last two decades.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.200 align:middle line:84%
As he scours the
globe and reaches

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.680 align:middle line:84%
into both obvious and obscure
scientific data, as well

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.440 align:middle line:84%
as indigenous wisdom,
his story broadens.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.950 align:middle line:84%
In his newest book, Deep Truth,
Gregg ventures into areas

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.560 align:middle line:84%
that are very threatening to
the established scientific

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.580 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Namely, that modern
civilization is

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.750 align:middle line:84%
far older than is
taught in our schools,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.370 align:middle line:84%
that the behavior
of people is not

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.540 align:middle line:84%
the primary factor
in global warming,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.760 align:middle line:84%
and that nature is hardwired for
peace, not competition and war.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Once again, Gregg
enthusiastically

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.160 align:middle line:84%
shares his vision of where
humanity is headed in this,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.390 align:middle line:90%
our latest conversation.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Gregg, fabulous to
see you, as always.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>> It is really good to see you.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm absolutely
thrilled to be here.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.850 align:middle line:90%
This year, this is 2012.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:07.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.899 align:middle line:84%
>> We're in the first six
weeks, the first seven weeks

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:11.584 align:middle line:84%
of the year 2012,
with our audience.

00:01:11.584 --> 00:01:13.750 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time I've
been with you this year.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.470 align:middle line:84%
We have a brand-new
book, brand-new material.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.050 align:middle line:84%
I've got so much
I'd love to share.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Deep Truth.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Deep Truth.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>> You want to share
some deep truths,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.840 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
title of the book.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.370 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.411 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it is the title.

00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:25.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of the first
questions that people ask,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.570 align:middle line:84%
or one of the first
things I learned

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:84%
when I released the
book and people asked--

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.666 align:middle line:84%
in October of 2011, that's
when the book was released,

00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:36.040 align:middle line:84%
one of the first
things I learned

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.470 align:middle line:84%
is that truth means different
things to different people.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Truth is a bit of
a charged word.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Some people thought it was
presumptuous of me to write

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.910 align:middle line:90%
a book entitled Deep Truth.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, how can I
say this is the truth?

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.339 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to begin,
if we could, just

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:51.880 align:middle line:84%
share a little bit
with our listeners

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.600 align:middle line:84%
about where that
title even came from.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.430 align:middle line:84%
This book was unique for me in
that I generally choose a title

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.510 align:middle line:84%
and then write the book
directed toward the title.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.332 align:middle line:84%
This book was almost
complete before I

00:02:06.332 --> 00:02:07.540 align:middle line:90%
knew what the title would be.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.400 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know exactly
what the title

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.230 align:middle line:90%
was going to be for this book.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was in a
bibliographical research piece,

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.930 align:middle line:90%
bibliography of Niels Bohr--

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.140 align:middle line:84%
20th century physicist,
colleague, and friend of Albert

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Einstein-- that I discovered
the title of the book.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.000 align:middle line:84%
The two of them were
having a conversation,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.950 align:middle line:84%
in the mid-20th century,
about the nature of truth.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And in this case,
their conversation,

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.660 align:middle line:90%
it was scientific truth.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.180 align:middle line:90%
And this was 1940s.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.140 align:middle line:84%
It was like every week,
a new research paper

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.030 align:middle line:84%
was being published
redefining what

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.820 align:middle line:84%
we thought we knew about
the world of physics

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.900 align:middle line:90%
and the laws of nature.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was the comment
that Niels Bohr made

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.794 align:middle line:84%
to Albert Einstein that it just
resonated with me so quickly,

00:02:54.794 --> 00:02:55.960 align:middle line:90%
and I'm just going to share.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a direct quote.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Niels Bohr said, "It is the
hallmark of any deep truth

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.490 align:middle line:84%
that its negation is
also a deep truth."

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.570 align:middle line:90%
End of quote.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.240 align:middle line:90%
And I thought about that.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I
thought, how profound.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.310 align:middle line:84%
So what he was saying is
when new discoveries overturn

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.610 align:middle line:84%
the discoveries that we used
to think describe the deepest

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.610 align:middle line:84%
truths of our existence, then
the new discoveries themselves

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.200 align:middle line:90%
become the new deep truths.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.330 align:middle line:84%
I said, that is precisely
where we find ourselves

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.130 align:middle line:90%
in the world today.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.350 align:middle line:84%
That's the title of my
new book, Deep Truth.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And you go for every one
of these issues that are being

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.710 align:middle line:90%
overturned as we speak.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there are so many
new discoveries that--

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.000 align:middle line:84%
peer-reviewed
scientific discoveries.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:84%
The book is not
based on speculation.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.530 align:middle line:84%
It's not Gregg-ism
or my opinions

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.050 align:middle line:90%
or new thoughts or new age.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.309 align:middle line:84%
It is based upon
peer-reviewed scientific fact.

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And I did that
intentionally, Regina,

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.140 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted this book
to represent the deepest

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.570 align:middle line:84%
truth of what we now understand
about our relationship

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.820 align:middle line:90%
to ourselves and the world.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And we have an audience
that I call the choir.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And I love the choir,
because the choir

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.681 align:middle line:84%
has supported me, my work,
for almost 30 years now.

00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:13.930 align:middle line:84%
We're coming up on 30 years
that I've shared this work

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.130 align:middle line:90%
in one form or another.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And have really worked
from a grassroots level

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.980 align:middle line:84%
to help us get the
work out there.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:84%
But what I know is this-- where
we find ourselves in the world

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.130 align:middle line:84%
today, while the grassroots
comes from the bottom up,

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.720 align:middle line:84%
we must work within the existing
power structures from the top

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.040 align:middle line:84%
down if we are truly going to
bring about the kind of change,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.620 align:middle line:84%
the degree, the
magnitude of change

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.530 align:middle line:84%
that we're all talking about
in a very brief period of time.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.070 align:middle line:84%
We must work within
existing power structures

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.870 align:middle line:84%
rather than trying
to do an end run

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.090 align:middle line:84%
or circumvent those
power structures.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to do
that in the Western world

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.250 align:middle line:84%
is to share the discoveries
in a language that

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.010 align:middle line:90%
is respected and trusted.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.726 align:middle line:84%
And in the West, that language
is the language of science.

00:04:59.726 --> 00:05:01.600 align:middle line:84%
If I were to go into an
indigenous-- and I've

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.400 align:middle line:90%
done this.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.790 align:middle line:84%
When I go into the monasteries
of Tibet and to Egypt,

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.360 align:middle line:84%
for example, and I talk
to the monks or the nuns

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.100 align:middle line:84%
about new scientific
discoveries,

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.990 align:middle line:84%
the first thing
they do is giggle,

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.700 align:middle line:84%
because it's
unimportant to them.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.050 align:middle line:90%
Who needs the discoveries?

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.490 align:middle line:90%
They live the principles.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.930 align:middle line:84%
But in the Western world,
because our choices

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.110 align:middle line:90%
are impacting the whole world--

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.790 align:middle line:84%
very, very few
places in the world

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.330 align:middle line:84%
that the choices that we're
making now of how we deal,

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.450 align:middle line:84%
adapt to climate change or
confront climate change, how

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.560 align:middle line:84%
we deal with new diseases,
how we deal with the inability

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.930 align:middle line:84%
to grow the food to support
the global populations,

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.340 align:middle line:84%
disappearing of fresh water,
the disparity between wealth

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.620 align:middle line:84%
and poverty, the
growing disparity,

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.470 align:middle line:84%
the growing disparity between
illiteracy and education--

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.780 align:middle line:84%
these are just the tip of the
iceberg of the kinds of crises

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.370 align:middle line:84%
the best minds of
our time tell us

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.620 align:middle line:90%
that we are facing right now.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.660 align:middle line:84%
They say it's not
our imagination,

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.840 align:middle line:84%
that this generation,
this time in history,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.290 align:middle line:84%
we are, in fact,
facing the greatest

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.960 align:middle line:84%
number and the greatest
magnitude of crises

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.860 align:middle line:84%
ever to face a single
generation in 5,000 years

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.030 align:middle line:90%
of recorded human history.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And they're telling
us that we've

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.990 align:middle line:84%
got, in some cases, less than
two years, less than 24 months,

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.080 align:middle line:84%
to change the way we think to
address some of the crises.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And even less than that when
it comes to the big war that's

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.600 align:middle line:90%
looming over the Middle East.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.210 align:middle line:90%
I think we all sense that.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Or when it comes to the collapse
of a global economic system.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.900 align:middle line:84%
We have less than two years
to figure those things out.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.960 align:middle line:84%
The same people that
tell us of the crises

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.090 align:middle line:84%
are telling us that they exist
because of a way of thinking,

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.810 align:middle line:84%
that the crises are
the out-picturing

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.376 align:middle line:84%
of a way of thinking
and a way of living

00:06:46.376 --> 00:06:47.500 align:middle line:90%
that's led to those crises.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So if we try to solve them
through the same thinking that

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.170 align:middle line:84%
created them, we know
where that's going to lead.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.230 align:middle line:84%
So the book describes
new discoveries.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.530 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that
there are a series

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.050 align:middle line:84%
of new scientific
discoveries that

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.010 align:middle line:84%
overturn the deepest truths
that we held of our past.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.230 align:middle line:84%
The new discoveries now
become the new deep truths.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.760 align:middle line:90%
That's the good news.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.600 align:middle line:84%
The flip side is that there is
a reluctance and, in some cases,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.880 align:middle line:84%
an outright resistance
to share this information

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.740 align:middle line:90%
in the mainstream.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.800 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by that
is mainstream media,

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.070 align:middle line:84%
mainstream documentaries,
mainstream television,

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.640 align:middle line:84%
mainstream classrooms,
mainstream textbooks.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.719 align:middle line:84%
A reluctance, in some cases
an outright resistance--

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:36.010 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to be very
clear with our listeners here.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.310 align:middle line:84%
When I talk about the classroom,
it's not the teacher's fault.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.080 align:middle line:84%
In the United
States of America--

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.600 align:middle line:84%
because I know people view
this beyond our borders.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.970 align:middle line:84%
But in the United
States of America,

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:50.380 align:middle line:84%
every teacher is bound by a
covenant within the specific

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.580 align:middle line:84%
state where they teach that
determines what can and cannot

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.920 align:middle line:84%
be shared publicly in the
classroom if it's a publicly

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.550 align:middle line:90%
funded classroom.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And every state is
a little different,

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and some of the states,
there are common themes,

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.210 align:middle line:84%
such as the teaching of what can
and cannot be shared regarding

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.840 align:middle line:84%
human evolution is one of
the places where this--

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.570 align:middle line:84%
or climate change,
this comes up a lot.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.470 align:middle line:84%
So the good news is that new
discoveries have shown us

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.660 align:middle line:84%
where the thinking
of the past can

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:24.700 align:middle line:84%
be revised to reflect a deeper
reality, a deeper truth.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.090 align:middle line:84%
The flip side is that
mainstream's not getting that.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.660 align:middle line:84%
So I chose five of
those principles

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.720 align:middle line:84%
that I call false assumptions
of science, five that I think

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.419 align:middle line:84%
have had perhaps
the greatest impact

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:38.860 align:middle line:84%
on our lives and
our world today,

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.600 align:middle line:84%
and I described those five
in the new book Deep Truth,

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.210 align:middle line:84%
subtitle Igniting the Memory of
our Origin, History, Destiny,

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:47.830 align:middle line:90%
and Fate.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And in this book, I mean,
you're talking about all

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.780 align:middle line:84%
the most essential
issues to humanity.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.560 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about the
sustainability of our host,

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.960 align:middle line:90%
our mother, the Earth itself.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.530 align:middle line:84%
But you're also talking
about the species,

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:08.220 align:middle line:84%
to reflecting on ourselves
in a different way now.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Darwinian theory of
evolution isn't working anymore.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Darwin's part of it.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:20.500 align:middle line:84%
The key for me of the many new
discoveries that have been made

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.980 align:middle line:84%
and are made-- peer-reviewed
scientific discoveries that

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.100 align:middle line:84%
completely changed the way
we've been led to think about

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.110 align:middle line:84%
our relationship to our
bodies, our relationship

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.360 align:middle line:84%
to the physical world, our
relationship to the Earth,

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.150 align:middle line:84%
our relationship to
history, to the past,

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.720 align:middle line:84%
civilizations the past,
of the many discoveries--

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.780 align:middle line:84%
I chose five that I think are,
perhaps, having the greatest

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.920 align:middle line:84%
impact on the crises
that we have today.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And the thinking that can make
the greatest amount of change

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.670 align:middle line:84%
in the least amount of time
regarding those crises.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:57.040 align:middle line:84%
So what it really boiled down
to, Regina, was simply this--

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.740 align:middle line:84%
the best minds of our
time are telling us,

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.840 align:middle line:84%
in no uncertain
terms, that we're

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.780 align:middle line:84%
facing the greatest crises
of our very existence,

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.397 align:middle line:90%
our survival.

00:10:06.397 --> 00:10:07.480 align:middle line:90%
They're telling us to act.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.620 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, you've
got to do something.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.220 align:middle line:90%
We've got to act quickly.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.250 align:middle line:90%
So my question is this, how?

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:17.050 align:middle line:84%
How can we possibly make
the greatest choices

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.860 align:middle line:84%
of our future and our survival
until we answer the deepest

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.230 align:middle line:90%
truths of our existence?

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.491 align:middle line:90%
And the reason for that--

00:10:24.491 --> 00:10:25.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going
invite our listeners.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.448 align:middle line:84%
If you've never
thought about this,

00:10:27.448 --> 00:10:30.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to invite you just to
think about this for a moment.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.040 align:middle line:84%
The way we answer
a single question

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.830 align:middle line:84%
is at the root of every
choice that we're ever

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:37.000 align:middle line:90%
going to make in our lives.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.360 align:middle line:84%
It's the core of every
decision that we will ever

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.220 align:middle line:84%
make as individuals,
in our personal lives,

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.170 align:middle line:90%
collectively, globally.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.970 align:middle line:84%
It's every crisis
that we've ever faced,

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:49.090 align:middle line:90%
the way we address the crisis.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.820 align:middle line:84%
As different as those things
sound from one another,

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.620 align:middle line:84%
the way we answer
a single question

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.810 align:middle line:84%
determines how we
approach those answers.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.350 align:middle line:90%
And the question is simply this.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:02.610 align:middle line:84%
For an individual, we ask
the question, who am I?

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:07.680 align:middle line:84%
For a civilization, for
a planet, who are we?

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>> In the Western world, those
answers largely have been

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.530 align:middle line:84%
offered and, consciously
or subconsciously,

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.500 align:middle line:84%
we have embraced the teachings
of science for the last 150

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.410 align:middle line:84%
We may not consciously
know that's what we say.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.560 align:middle line:84%
It's just we repeat
the stories so often

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.080 align:middle line:84%
about where people come
from and how we got here

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.100 align:middle line:84%
and how old civilization is
and climate change and all

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.540 align:middle line:90%
those things.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:38.406 align:middle line:84%
So what I began to
understand was just that,

00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:40.740 align:middle line:84%
that the deepest
truths, what we believe

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.100 align:middle line:84%
to be the deepest truths,
are the result of what

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.690 align:middle line:90%
someone else has told us.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:47.910 align:middle line:84%
The scientific community
and the new discoveries

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.070 align:middle line:84%
are telling us a lot
of what's taught today

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.570 align:middle line:90%
is simply no longer scientific.

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:52.665 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:11:52.665 --> 00:11:53.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:53.465 --> 00:11:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And because of the reluctance
to share new discoveries,

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.670 align:middle line:84%
what we're teaching in our
classroom is, by definition,

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:middle line:90%
no longer science.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.950 align:middle line:84%
So we have a whole
generation of young people

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.550 align:middle line:84%
that are about to dedicate
their entire lives to solving

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.100 align:middle line:84%
some of the deepest
mysteries of human existence.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And they're being required
to answer those questions

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.830 align:middle line:84%
within the boundaries, the
context, of what we now

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.360 align:middle line:90%
know is false science.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.731 align:middle line:84%
They're not being given
the full toolbox to do it.

00:12:23.731 --> 00:12:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So that would be
important any time.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.480 align:middle line:84%
It's really important
now because of where

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.080 align:middle line:84%
we find ourselves in the
history of our world.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:90%
So this is the context.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.124 align:middle line:90%
We are, in fact, facing the--

00:12:34.124 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>> I have a question--

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.081 align:middle line:84%
>> --greatest number and
magnitude of crises ever

00:12:37.081 --> 00:12:38.910 align:middle line:90%
to face recorded human history.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Absolutely, and this refusal
to budge within the scientific

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and academic communities
to allow a little new light

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.900 align:middle line:84%
and information to shine on in,
obviously, there comes a point,

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.630 align:middle line:84%
and we talked about
this last time,

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.900 align:middle line:84%
where people of the planet are
going to have to say, look,

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.869 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to choose
another kind of authority.

00:12:59.869 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to choose
my own authority,

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.900 align:middle line:84%
my own understanding,
my instincts.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And I will weave
in the information

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.890 align:middle line:84%
I choose to, because
the authorities aren't

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.890 align:middle line:90%
leveling with us anymore.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.560 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the young
people feel it.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:12.360 align:middle line:90%
They get it.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.160 align:middle line:90%
They know it.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>> They do, and what
you're saying is true.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm even amazed,
knowing what I know,

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:24.210 align:middle line:84%
how deeply ingrained, in
the unconscious level,

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:25.532 align:middle line:90%
many of these principles are.

00:13:25.532 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle line:84%
So maybe the best
thing to do here, let's

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.244 align:middle line:84%
identify five principles,
zero in on a couple that

00:13:31.244 --> 00:13:32.910 align:middle line:84%
are having the greatest
impact, and that

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:34.962 align:middle line:90%
will give a perfect example.

00:13:34.962 --> 00:13:37.170 align:middle line:84%
People say to me, you know,
Gregg, what you're saying

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:37.970 align:middle line:90%
might be true.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:39.330 align:middle line:90%
Why is it important?

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.860 align:middle line:84%
What difference could it
possibly make in our lives?

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And if we do this, it
might answer that question.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go for it.

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you OK if
we do it that way?

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>> We can go from the top to
the bottom or bottom to the top.

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:52.352 align:middle line:84%
Because you know your
material better than anybody,

00:13:52.352 --> 00:13:54.810 align:middle line:84%
which of the five deep truths
would you like to start with?

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me identify the truths,
and then I'm going to zero in.

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:00.896 align:middle line:84%
The last one, identify,
would be the first one

00:14:00.896 --> 00:14:01.770 align:middle line:90%
that I'll talk about.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:03.353 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the one I
would choose, too,

00:14:03.353 --> 00:14:04.290 align:middle line:90%
so let's go for it.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are many false
assumptions of science.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.430 align:middle line:90%
I've chosen five for the book.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.220 align:middle line:84%
So let me just share
with our listeners

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.140 align:middle line:84%
the five false
assumptions that are still

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:16.990 align:middle line:84%
being taught as fact in
classrooms and textbooks today.

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:84%
The first one is a
Darwinian assumption

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.670 align:middle line:90%
of the nature of our existence.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.330 align:middle line:84%
It's being taught
in the classroom

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.200 align:middle line:84%
that evolution explains life
in general and human life

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.700 align:middle line:90%
specifically.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.710 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
the data no longer

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:35.440 align:middle line:84%
supports that idea, that
theory, on the one hand.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.960 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
if there is even

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.570 align:middle line:84%
a mention of alternative
or competing theories,

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.800 align:middle line:84%
there are teachers in
the United States--

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.160 align:middle line:84%
elementary, middle school,
and college professors

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.380 align:middle line:84%
are losing their jobs
because they even

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:53.130 align:middle line:84%
mention the fact that there
may be alternative theories.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And the thinking is the
alternative theories revolve

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.440 align:middle line:84%
around religion, and that's
where the problem comes in.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:00.135 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not about religion.

00:15:00.135 --> 00:15:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Deep problem.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Big problem.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.460 align:middle line:90%
So this is deep truth.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Or the false
assumption, number one,

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:10.260 align:middle line:84%
is that evolution explains life,
evolution explains human life.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.420 align:middle line:84%
False assumption number
two is about how long we've

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.074 align:middle line:90%
been here in civilization.

00:15:14.074 --> 00:15:15.990 align:middle line:84%
When I was in school,
when you were in school,

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.460 align:middle line:84%
most of our-- let's
see, how old are we?

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.530 align:middle line:84%
We're all within 50 years
of one another, right?

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I think so.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:21.348 align:middle line:90%
Probably just a couple.

00:15:21.348 --> 00:15:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>> We're all about the same age,
within 50 years one another.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.960 align:middle line:84%
When I was in school back
in the '60s and '70s, most

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.390 align:middle line:84%
of our viewers, and if you
have children in school today,

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:33.180 align:middle line:84%
we're being taught that
civilization is about 5,000

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.070 align:middle line:90%
years old, that it began--

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.490 align:middle line:90%
advanced civilization.

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:39.930 align:middle line:84%
That civilization
as we know it began

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:44.370 align:middle line:84%
in the area of ancient
Mesopotamia, Sumeria,

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.200 align:middle line:90%
and that it's a one-time deal.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.130 align:middle line:90%
It's linear.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:50.250 align:middle line:84%
It's developed from primitive
to the sophistication

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:51.597 align:middle line:90%
of what we see today.

00:15:51.597 --> 00:15:53.430 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, the
data doesn't support it.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:56.520 align:middle line:84%
The data, peer-reviewed
scientific discoveries

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:01.470 align:middle line:84%
published in relatively
obscure journals,

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:03.720 align:middle line:84%
are telling us very
clearly that civilization,

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.340 align:middle line:84%
advanced civilization,
is at least--

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.290 align:middle line:84%
at least-- twice as old as
what we've been led to believe.

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And the implications for that
will be clear in just a moment.

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:12.480 align:middle line:90%
That's number two.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.810 align:middle line:90%
Number three regards physics.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.540 align:middle line:84%
We're being taught that
consciousness is somehow

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.310 align:middle line:84%
separate from our
physical world.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:22.830 align:middle line:84%
The problem is the
new discoveries,

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.310 align:middle line:84%
supported by brilliant
minds such as Professor John

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Wheeler, Princeton University,
a colleague of Einstein--

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.580 align:middle line:90%
I think he died in 2008--

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.920 align:middle line:84%
are very clearly telling us
that the reason we've not

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.840 align:middle line:84%
been able to unify
the field of physics

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.370 align:middle line:84%
is because consciousness was
written out of the equations.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And when we put
consciousness back

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:49.035 align:middle line:84%
in, the stuff that underlies
all physical existence, then

00:16:49.035 --> 00:16:50.910 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden, the
equations begin to work.

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.800 align:middle line:84%
So number three, we're being
taught that consciousness is

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.050 align:middle line:90%
separate from physical matter.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:57.560 align:middle line:84%
Number four is related
to number three

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.020 align:middle line:84%
in that the space between
physical things is empty.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.520 align:middle line:84%
We now know there is no
empty space in the universe.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.940 align:middle line:84%
There is a form of energy
that exists everywhere.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:84%
However, it is a
form of energy that

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:13.440 align:middle line:84%
doesn't behave the way
we have expected energy

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.599 align:middle line:84%
to behave in the
past, which means

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:18.990 align:middle line:84%
that the equipment that we've
used to look for the energy

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:20.400 align:middle line:90%
didn't see it.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Because the equipment is
designed to look for things

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.260 align:middle line:84%
like magnetic fields
and electrical fields.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.190 align:middle line:84%
This energy doesn't
work that way.

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:28.680 align:middle line:84%
So we know there
is no empty space.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.480 align:middle line:90%
That's number four.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And number five
is the last, but I

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.210 align:middle line:84%
think it may be one
of the most critical,

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:36.030 align:middle line:90%
is another Darwinian assumption.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Charles Darwin said, in 1859,
from his personal observations,

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.922 align:middle line:84%
he said that nature is
built upon a model--

00:17:44.922 --> 00:17:46.380 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
use his language--

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.620 align:middle line:84%
that he called survival of
the strongest it was later

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.440 align:middle line:84%
interpreted as survival
of the fittest.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is that
the data absolutely

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.614 align:middle line:90%
does not support that.

00:17:56.614 --> 00:17:57.780 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to begin there.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.020 align:middle line:90%
Are you OK?

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Can I zero in on that one first,
and it'll actually lead us--

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>> There's where I'd
like you to begin.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:01.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes, please.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:02.706 align:middle line:90%
>> --into some others.

00:18:02.706 --> 00:18:05.700 align:middle line:84%
People have said to me, in
audiences all over the world--

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:09.780 align:middle line:84%
I released this book
in October of 2011.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.900 align:middle line:84%
I shared the information
in other countries

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.210 align:middle line:84%
long before the
book was released.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And people said, well, Gregg,
OK, we get what you're saying.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.286 align:middle line:90%
New discoveries are important.

00:18:21.286 --> 00:18:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Probably we should
talk about it,

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.420 align:middle line:84%
but what difference
does it make now?

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Darwin introduced
that stuff in 1859.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.520 align:middle line:90%
Here we are in 2011, 2012.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.730 align:middle line:90%
Why is it important?

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why, just a
little bit of background here.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:39.030 align:middle line:84%
1859, Charles Darwin wrote
or published his first book.

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.420 align:middle line:84%
It was titled On the
Origin of Species

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:45.160 align:middle line:90%
by Means of Natural Selection.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.665 align:middle line:84%
It was based on research
that he'd done in the 1830s.

00:18:48.665 --> 00:18:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason
this is important

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.340 align:middle line:84%
is because before his
book was published,

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:57.050 align:middle line:84%
the big questions of life were
answered largely by the church,

00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.640 align:middle line:84%
by the Catholic Church,
religious communities,

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.440 align:middle line:90%
spiritual communities.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.750 align:middle line:84%
So Charles Darwin was
the first scientist

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:07.140 align:middle line:84%
that took a stab at
scientifically addressing

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:10.420 align:middle line:84%
our relationship to
the world and answering

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.419 align:middle line:90%
the big question who are we.

00:19:13.419 --> 00:19:14.710 align:middle line:90%
And I want to be clear on this.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.320 align:middle line:90%
I was trained as a scientist.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.712 align:middle line:90%
I think science is good.

00:19:17.712 --> 00:19:19.170 align:middle line:84%
I believe in the
scientific method.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I think our lives are certainly
better because of science,

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.580 align:middle line:90%
in some respects.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.710 align:middle line:84%
Science does not
have all the answers.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:27.900 align:middle line:90%
Science is a young language.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a young way of looking
and thinking of our world.

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.760 align:middle line:90%
It's only about 300 years old.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.810 align:middle line:84%
So I think Darwin was probably
a pretty good scientist.

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.550 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, here's
where he made his mistake.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:41.430 align:middle line:90%
Here's where Darwin went wrong.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Charles Darwin took
observations that he

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:48.600 align:middle line:84%
made for some forms of life
in some parts of the world,

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.370 align:middle line:84%
and he tried to apply them
to all life everywhere,

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.260 align:middle line:90%
including human life.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.571 align:middle line:84%
And the data simply
doesn't support it.

00:19:55.571 --> 00:19:56.820 align:middle line:90%
So here's what I mean by that.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:01.410 align:middle line:84%
He would go into nature,
and he would see examples

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:05.120 align:middle line:90%
of birds, two siblings--

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:05.920 align:middle line:90%
same species.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.760 align:middle line:84%
They were siblings in
a nest, young birds.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Another bird of another species
would come into that nest,

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and the two that were there
originally would immediately

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:19.320 align:middle line:84%
eject the bird from the nest
because it was different.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Or he saw colonies
of larger ants

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.850 align:middle line:84%
capturing smaller
colonies of ants

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:28.110 align:middle line:90%
and making slaves out of them.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.160 align:middle line:90%
They didn't kill them.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.410 align:middle line:84%
They enslaved them to
do their work for them.

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Darwin, in his way
of thinking, he

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.960 align:middle line:84%
believed that when
he saw these things,

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.040 align:middle line:90%
little examples in nature.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.130 align:middle line:84%
He believed they were
small expressions

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:44.090 align:middle line:84%
of a general law that
applies to everybody,

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.630 align:middle line:90%
and we've heard this law before.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:49.770 align:middle line:84%
The law is multiply,
vary, let the strongest

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:51.880 align:middle line:90%
live and the weakest die.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Let the strongest live
and the weakest die.

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:57.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
dangerous way of thinking.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:59.110 align:middle line:90%
1859.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Because it was the
first scientific attempt

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.950 align:middle line:84%
to describe our
relationship to the world,

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:09.370 align:middle line:84%
his idea was embraced quickly
without a lot of investigation.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:11.380 align:middle line:84%
People just accepted
it as science,

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.150 align:middle line:90%
so it was embraced quickly.

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:17.700 align:middle line:84%
It became very deeply entrenched
in the emerging modern world.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And Regina, it's so much
a part of our lives today.

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us, our
listeners, no matter

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.400 align:middle line:84%
how conscious we believe
we are and how much

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.670 align:middle line:84%
work we've done with ourselves,
subconsciously, this idea

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.790 align:middle line:84%
is so ingrained
into the way that we

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:37.240 align:middle line:84%
have been taught to live,
to think, the systems

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.420 align:middle line:84%
that we've grown to
rely upon for our lives.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.380 align:middle line:84%
We've been taught that
it's a dog-eat-dog world,

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.490 align:middle line:84%
that if we don't go
out there and fight,

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:48.730 align:middle line:84%
the world's going to
just roll right over us.

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Corporations are
based on this idea

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.470 align:middle line:90%
of survival of the strongest.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.620 align:middle line:84%
The global economy,
that's collapsing

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.680 align:middle line:84%
as we have this
conversation right now,

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.690 align:middle line:84%
it is based on survival
of the strongest.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And the way we solve many of our
problems in the 20th century,

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.530 align:middle line:84%
a time that historians tell
us was the bloodiest century

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:11.890 align:middle line:84%
in all of recorded human
history, is based on this idea

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:15.490 align:middle line:84%
that there's a pie,
one pie, and that we've

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:19.690 align:middle line:84%
got to fight for the
biggest slice of that pie.

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:23.260 align:middle line:84%
The problem with all of this is
the new discoveries very, very

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:27.730 align:middle line:84%
clearly are telling us that
while competition does happen

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:30.880 align:middle line:84%
in some circumstances,
and we've all seen it,

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.240 align:middle line:84%
it's not the rule that
nature is based upon.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Over 400 peer-reviewed
studies were

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.590 align:middle line:84%
done late 1990s, early
2000s asking one question,

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.340 align:middle line:84%
and they all came up
with the same answer.

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:48.760 align:middle line:84%
The question is, what is the
optimum amount of competition

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:49.780 align:middle line:90%
in any environment?

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are
scientists that rarely

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.700 align:middle line:84%
use broad, sweeping
statements, but they do.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And what the
scientific paper said,

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:58.690 align:middle line:84%
the optimum amount
of competition in any

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:02.050 align:middle line:84%
environment-- in the
classroom, in the workplace,

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:03.220 align:middle line:90%
on the playing field--

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.560 align:middle line:90%
is zero.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:09.530 align:middle line:84%
That competition always,
always, always is destructive.

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:11.950 align:middle line:84%
It's detrimental to the
individual and the community.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Cooperation and
mutual aid is the rule

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.800 align:middle line:90%
that nature is based upon.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Very prestigious journals like
New Scientist, April 2008--

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Michael Le Page wrote
a beautiful article.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And what he said, and I'll
quote this as best I can,

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:31.570 align:middle line:84%
he said, what we
see in nature is not

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.250 align:middle line:90%
every animal out for itself.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:37.900 align:middle line:84%
We see cooperation, he said,
is an incredibly successful

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.160 align:middle line:90%
strategy for survival.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.640 align:middle line:84%
When cooperation breaks down,
the results can be disastrous.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.910 align:middle line:84%
That's the end of the
quote, so I remembered it.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And now, you and Bruce
Lipton have done a lot of work

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:49.050 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well he's my
dear friend, brother.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.340 align:middle line:84%
We traveled through Europe
in a train together.

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:52.400 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.090 align:middle line:90%
You're brothers.

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:53.930 align:middle line:90%
You love each other.

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm just looking
at that from that lens,

00:23:56.350 --> 00:24:01.120 align:middle line:84%
which is going down
to a cellular level,

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:05.020 align:middle line:84%
imagine what would happen
if we applied that theory

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.132 align:middle line:84%
on a cellular level
in the human body.

00:24:07.132 --> 00:24:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>> You're about four
sentences-- you're a woman ahead

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.140 align:middle line:90%
of your time.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.760 align:middle line:84%
You're four sentences
ahead of me.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Because what people
say is, what do you mean

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:14.779 align:middle line:90%
by cooperation?

00:24:14.779 --> 00:24:15.820 align:middle line:90%
Here's a perfect example.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Anyone watching this, we think
that we're individual bodies,

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.130 align:middle line:90%
and Bruce tells us--

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:23.350 align:middle line:84%
my dear brother,
Bruce Lipton, tells us

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:25.810 align:middle line:84%
in his book, The
Biology of Belief,

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:27.790 align:middle line:84%
that our body is not
really an individual,

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:30.600 align:middle line:84%
that we're a community of
about 50 trillion cells.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And the community
is only possible

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:34.810 align:middle line:84%
because of the cooperation of
those cells working together.

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:37.390 align:middle line:84%
When the cells no
longer work together

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:40.000 align:middle line:84%
is what we call illness,
disease, and death.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.540 align:middle line:84%
So at the most fundamental
level of the lives of all

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:47.320 align:middle line:84%
of our viewers, we have a
personal first-hand experience

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:53.939 align:middle line:84%
of how important cooperation
is in our lives, in the world.

00:24:53.939 --> 00:24:55.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make
a distinction here.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:59.410 align:middle line:84%
So people say what
about capitalism

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:02.620 align:middle line:84%
and the role of cooperation
in capitalism or competition

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:03.940 align:middle line:90%
in capitalism?

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.754 align:middle line:10%
The kind of competition that
Darwin was talking about

00:25:06.754 --> 00:25:08.170 align:middle line:10%
and that we're
talking about here,

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:13.170 align:middle line:10%
it's not like a friendly game
of chess or a game of baseball.

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:15.260 align:middle line:90%
This is violent competition.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to make a distinction.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Especially in the
classroom, we're

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:22.230 align:middle line:84%
taught that competition is
good for our young people.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:23.515 align:middle line:90%
Well, it may be.

00:25:23.515 --> 00:25:25.660 align:middle line:84%
It depends on how
it's implemented.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.975 align:middle line:84%
What happens more often
than not in our classroom

00:25:27.975 --> 00:25:29.830 align:middle line:84%
is young people
are taught to get

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:33.880 align:middle line:84%
the right answer on the test
any way they can, at any cost.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Or to score the point on the
playing field any way they can.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's less about their
personal excellence

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:47.530 align:middle line:84%
and more about exploiting the
weakness of the other person.

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:50.080 align:middle line:84%
This is a subtle and it's
a powerful difference.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.930 align:middle line:84%
When competition is about
exploiting and capitalizing

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:54.940 align:middle line:84%
on the weakness
of another, that's

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:84%
different than
competition based on us

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.867 align:middle line:84%
being the best that we can,
doing the best job we can,

00:26:02.867 --> 00:26:04.450 align:middle line:84%
creating the best
product that we can.

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:05.020 align:middle line:90%
It's subtle--

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for making
that distinction.

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>> --but it's powerful.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very important.

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a very powerful
distinction.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>> We're watching what's
happening economically

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.420 align:middle line:90%
as a result of that mindset.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so people say, what
impact could that possibly have

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:19.390 align:middle line:90%
on the world?

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to go
back to the context.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.993 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this would be
important at any time.

00:26:22.993 --> 00:26:25.300 align:middle line:84%
It's really important now
because of the context.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:26.860 align:middle line:84%
We're living a time
of the greatest

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:31.150 align:middle line:84%
crises of 5,000 years of
recorded human history, when

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:32.960 align:middle line:84%
the best minds of
our time tell us

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.050 align:middle line:84%
we've got to think
differently quickly

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:37.450 align:middle line:84%
or nothing else is
going to matter.

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:40.300 align:middle line:84%
One of the fundamental
differences, our civilization,

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.670 align:middle line:84%
our business model,
our economic model

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.550 align:middle line:84%
is based upon survival
of the strongest.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And if we want to see
where the consequences

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.880 align:middle line:84%
of a false assumption
can lead, we

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.379 align:middle line:84%
need look no further
than the crises

00:26:54.379 --> 00:26:55.420 align:middle line:90%
that are facing us today.

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:58.090 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge war looming
over the Middle East right now.

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:00.490 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
pushing for that war,

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:03.620 align:middle line:84%
because they believe that
war's good for the economy.

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:04.420 align:middle line:90%
So that's--

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:07.397 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just such a
sick, sick mindset.

00:27:07.397 --> 00:27:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a way of thinking,
because it worked in the 20th

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:12.760 align:middle line:90%
century in some people's minds.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:16.989 align:middle line:84%
>> Corporations are not based
on what's good for people.

00:27:16.989 --> 00:27:19.030 align:middle line:84%
They're based on what's
good for the corporation,

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:23.064 align:middle line:84%
for the bottom line,
for the dollar.

00:27:23.064 --> 00:27:23.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a personal story.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:26.290 align:middle line:84%
I experienced this
in the 1970s myself.

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:29.810 align:middle line:84%
I worked, I was a
computer geologist

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:34.500 align:middle line:84%
for Philips Petroleum back
in the 1970s energy crisis.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.880 align:middle line:84%
It was a healthy company at
that time, very diversified.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.785 align:middle line:84%
And I personally
witnessed this idea

00:27:40.785 --> 00:27:43.090 align:middle line:84%
of survival of
the strongest when

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:44.560 align:middle line:84%
an individual with
a lot of money

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:48.220 align:middle line:84%
came in and attempted
to buy Philips.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.260 align:middle line:90%
A healthy, strong company.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.857 align:middle line:90%
Employed a lot of people.

00:27:51.857 --> 00:27:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Did a lot of good
things in the world.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Not just oil and gas, but they
were minerals and plastics

00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:00.420 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of things,
domestically, foreignly,

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.200 align:middle line:90%
or foreign soil.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.490 align:middle line:90%
This person came in.

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:06.790 align:middle line:84%
It was called a corporate raider
was the term that was used.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And tried to take his
personal money to buy Philips,

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:14.290 align:middle line:84%
break it into smaller
segments, smaller companies

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:18.600 align:middle line:84%
that could be sold off at
a profit to the investors.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.110 align:middle line:90%
Put a lot of people out of work.

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Destroyed a healthy company,
a family-owned company.

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Been around almost 100 years.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.490 align:middle line:84%
It was a really
nasty thing to see,

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:30.520 align:middle line:84%
based on the survival
of the strongest.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Philips was able to fight him
off by selling off so much

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.184 align:middle line:84%
of their company there
wasn't much left,

00:28:35.184 --> 00:28:36.850 align:middle line:84%
and it was never the
same company again.

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:38.530 align:middle line:90%
They sold off their minerals.

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:40.750 align:middle line:84%
They sold off their
North Sea oil platforms.

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:43.310 align:middle line:84%
They sold off their
plastics division.

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.315 align:middle line:84%
But it was about this idea
of survival of the strongest.

00:28:46.315 --> 00:28:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>> It's like vultures.

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>> It was at that time, and
it's the result of a way

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.260 align:middle line:90%
of thinking.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So here we are, right now, the
early years, the 21st century.

00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:00.610 align:middle line:84%
We are living the last year
of a rare and mysterious cycle

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:06.130 align:middle line:84%
of time, a 5,125-year-long cycle
our ancestors called the Great

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:07.900 align:middle line:90%
World Age.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.690 align:middle line:84%
They knew that the cycle was
coming, because it always does,

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:17.560 align:middle line:84%
every 5,125 years, because
Earth's location in space

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:20.230 align:middle line:90%
changes on a rhythmic basis.

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:22.420 align:middle line:84%
That location, they
knew, would change

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:25.780 align:middle line:84%
the way we live on Earth,
the way we live in our lives.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Earth's location as
it changes in space,

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:31.240 align:middle line:90%
it changes the climate.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.710 align:middle line:90%
It changes the weather patterns.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:35.960 align:middle line:84%
It changes the way we're
able to grow our food,

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.355 align:middle line:84%
the way we're able
to share resources.

00:29:39.355 --> 00:29:42.130 align:middle line:90%
It happens every 5,000 years.

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And that change is what triggers
within us the ways of dealing

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:51.940 align:middle line:84%
with problems, and it tells us
what works and what doesn't.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Our thinking of competition
and survival of the strongest,

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:58.180 align:middle line:84%
if we try to address
this great change

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.220 align:middle line:84%
through that way
of thinking, we're

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.870 align:middle line:90%
already seeing where it leads.

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:04.600 align:middle line:84%
Because it's leading to the
collapse of ways of life

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.150 align:middle line:84%
that we have grown to
cherish in the past.

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:11.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's an opportunity to
change that way of thinking.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And the new discoveries give
us a good reason to do so,

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.580 align:middle line:84%
except they're not being
shared on a public--

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:17.380 align:middle line:90%
>> No, they're not.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.300 align:middle line:90%
And here, at the same time--

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>> --mainstream level.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>> --as all of
this is happening,

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:25.270 align:middle line:84%
the squeeze is happening, and
the fittest here economically--

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:27.530 align:middle line:84%
who aren't doing so well,
by the way, right now.

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:29.777 align:middle line:84%
A handful of people have
made out all right on this.

00:30:29.777 --> 00:30:30.610 align:middle line:90%
But what's happened?

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:33.160 align:middle line:84%
It's come at the expense of
virtually everything else.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:37.549 align:middle line:84%
What has happened to the poet,
to the artist, to the musician?

00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:39.340 align:middle line:84%
When you start looking
into the things that

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:43.720 align:middle line:84%
make life an expression, that's
the first thing squeezed out

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:47.590 align:middle line:84%
in favor of the most
functional types of positions

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:50.890 align:middle line:90%
that only serve that machine.

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.330 align:middle line:90%
And so we're at that point now.

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>> We are.

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And again, I think this
ties back into what you're--

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.760 align:middle line:84%
you know Michael Cremo, as
well, Forbidden Archeology.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I know him very well.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.940 align:middle line:90%
I just shared a panel with him.

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, you did.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And I spent a week with him
in 1996 in Boulder, Colorado,

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.604 align:middle line:90%
at a closed-door conference.

00:31:06.604 --> 00:31:08.020 align:middle line:84%
He's a brilliant
man, amazing man.

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>> He's a brilliant
man, and one of the--

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>> And a brother.

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>> And a brother.

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:12.634 align:middle line:90%
He's another of your brothers.

00:31:12.634 --> 00:31:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And I've interviewed
your brother.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:17.260 align:middle line:84%
I think he's a he's
an incredible man.

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.676 align:middle line:84%
And what he's
saying about this--

00:31:18.676 --> 00:31:20.800 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to take
you back into the theory

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:25.150 align:middle line:84%
of evolution and back into what
we are, what has inspired us--

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:27.970 align:middle line:84%
is that the theory of
evolution has become

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:31.600 align:middle line:84%
institutionalized because it
actually serves another larger

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.370 align:middle line:90%
kind of agenda.

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>> It's habit.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>> It's habit.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot of money
invested in supporting that

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:37.520 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you bet.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And it also keeps people limited
in our perceptions of self

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.860 align:middle line:90%
and our own capabilities.

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's not helping things.

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>> It can, but this is where
I think we have an opportunity

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:52.084 align:middle line:84%
to really rethink the way
we think about ourselves

00:31:52.084 --> 00:31:53.500 align:middle line:84%
and our relationship
to the Earth.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.432 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people out there
saying we made a lot of mistakes

00:31:56.432 --> 00:31:57.640 align:middle line:90%
and really screwed things up.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe that at all.

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.130 align:middle line:90%
What I believe is this.

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:02.470 align:middle line:84%
I think we're in a
huge learning curve.

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think the choices
that we made as individuals

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.560 align:middle line:84%
and as a civilization
in the past

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.210 align:middle line:84%
have been based on what
we knew at the time.

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And we made choices
based on what we knew.

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's all
we can ask of ourselves.

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Now we have the opportunity
to make new choices,

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.140 align:middle line:84%
and new information is
out there to inform us.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And where the problem comes in
is when that information is not

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:26.860 align:middle line:90%
shared.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.244 align:middle line:90%
Evolution is one example.

00:32:29.244 --> 00:32:30.160 align:middle line:90%
So now, let's go back.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.720 align:middle line:84%
I've just shared-- now, this
is one deep truth, number five,

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:37.257 align:middle line:84%
that nature is based upon
survival of the strongest.

00:32:37.257 --> 00:32:38.840 align:middle line:84%
We now know that's
a false assumption.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:42.430 align:middle line:84%
It's based on mutual
aid and cooperation.

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:46.620 align:middle line:84%
While competition can happen in
response to certain situations,

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:48.890 align:middle line:90%
it's not the rule of nature.

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm to pop up
to deep truth number

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:53.050 align:middle line:90%
two about civilization itself.

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:54.758 align:middle line:84%
This is where it gets
really interesting,

00:32:54.758 --> 00:32:57.410 align:middle line:90%
and context so important.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:00.060 align:middle line:84%
We're taught that 5,000 years
is the age of civilization.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:01.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a one-time deal.

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And I remember studying
my history books.

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And here's like 5,000 years
ago was Ancient Sumeria.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:09.989 align:middle line:84%
Egypt is more recent
and Rome and Greece.

00:33:09.989 --> 00:33:11.530 align:middle line:84%
All things I thought
were so ancient,

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:13.750 align:middle line:90%
they're actually more recent.

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:16.487 align:middle line:84%
And I remember asking
our professors,

00:33:16.487 --> 00:33:17.570 align:middle line:90%
what happened before that?

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And they said it's
like nothing was going.

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:21.977 align:middle line:84%
On Nobody here,
nothing was happening.

00:33:21.977 --> 00:33:24.310 align:middle line:84%
The archaeological evidence
doesn't support that at all.

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:26.674 align:middle line:84%
Peer-reviewed archaeological
evidence-- now,

00:33:26.674 --> 00:33:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I've had the opportunity
to personally document some

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.580 align:middle line:90%
of these sites myself--

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:34.120 align:middle line:84%
are now pushing the age
of advanced civilization

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:38.020 align:middle line:84%
back into the last ice age,
the end of the last ice age.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, as a former geologist,
what I can say to our listeners

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:44.380 align:middle line:84%
is the ice age ended
about 12,000 years ago.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.630 align:middle line:84%
After that, there
was 4,000 years

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:47.860 align:middle line:90%
of what's called a bad storm.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:48.670 align:middle line:90%
Really bad storm.

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:51.160 align:middle line:90%
It lasted 4,000 years.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's at the
end of the ice age

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:56.200 align:middle line:84%
and during the bad storm
when the temperatures rose.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.230 align:middle line:90%
There was a lot of rain.

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:58.030 align:middle line:90%
The ice melted.

00:33:58.030 --> 00:33:58.900 align:middle line:90%
The sea levels rose.

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:04.210 align:middle line:84%
That's when this last cycle
of civilization formed.

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:07.330 align:middle line:84%
So now, we have places--
the oldest site right now

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:08.889 align:middle line:90%
is called Gobekli Tepe.

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:11.110 align:middle line:90%
It's in Turkey.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:13.282 align:middle line:84%
Archaeologists have
not even excavated

00:34:13.282 --> 00:34:15.865 align:middle line:84%
to the bottom of the site, and
they're already dating this now

00:34:15.865 --> 00:34:17.920 align:middle line:90%
at 13,500 years old.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.199 align:middle line:84%
That's over twice as
old as what we've been

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:21.969 align:middle line:90%
led to believe in the past.

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:25.389 align:middle line:84%
Other sites, Catal Hoyuk,
another site in Turkey,

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:27.370 align:middle line:90%
8,000 to 9,000 years old.

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:32.679 align:middle line:84%
Off the coast of India,
under 120 feet of water,

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:37.639 align:middle line:84%
there is a site that is five
miles long, two miles wide.

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:41.562 align:middle line:90%
It is under 120 feet of water.

00:34:41.562 --> 00:34:44.020 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, it's a sign that
one of two things happened.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.603 align:middle line:84%
Either the site was
built under water,

00:34:45.603 --> 00:34:47.949 align:middle line:84%
which could happen
but isn't likely,

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:50.590 align:middle line:84%
or it was built near
the water, and when

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:55.449 align:middle line:84%
the climate changed and the sea
levels rose, it was submerged.

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So these are pre-ice
age in some cases?

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>> These are all right at
the edge of the ice age.

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:02.047 align:middle line:90%
The ice age is 12,000 years.

00:35:02.047 --> 00:35:03.880 align:middle line:84%
So some of these are
right back at-- they're

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.490 align:middle line:84%
dating now 13,500,
right around in there.

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:09.010 align:middle line:84%
But they haven't gotten to
the bottom of these yet.

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I personally
documented northern Peru.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.010 align:middle line:90%
There's a site called Caral.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:16.114 align:middle line:90%
Caral, Peru.

00:35:16.114 --> 00:35:17.530 align:middle line:84%
We don't know who
built this site.

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:19.810 align:middle line:84%
It's a 150-acre
site, five pyramids,

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:23.260 align:middle line:90%
two huge circular plazas.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.980 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where
they came from.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:26.230 align:middle line:90%
We don't know where they went.

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:27.550 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:31.330 align:middle line:84%
The day I was there is when the
laboratories-- the university

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:34.930 align:middle line:84%
called my translator with
the dating for the site.

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:37.760 align:middle line:84%
The day I was there is when
the dates were revealed.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.580 align:middle line:84%
We're taught that civilization
began 5,000 years ago.

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:41.830 align:middle line:90%
That's when Caral ended.

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:44.110 align:middle line:84%
It ended when we're
told that civilization

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:48.680 align:middle line:84%
began and dates back at least
2,000 years older than that.

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:49.480 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.390 align:middle line:90%
And there are other sites.

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:52.720 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I'm sharing
this, if it were one site,

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.400 align:middle line:90%
it could be an anomaly.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Now what's happening
is the anomalies

00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.270 align:middle line:84%
are telling a new story, and
the story is simply this.

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:02.090 align:middle line:84%
The 5,000 years that
we've been taught

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:04.710 align:middle line:84%
is the history of the
whole world forever,

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.710 align:middle line:84%
it's not the history of
the whole world forever.

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:10.850 align:middle line:84%
It's the history of the most
recent 5,000-year cycle based

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:13.670 align:middle line:90%
on Earth's alignment in space.

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And before that, there was
another 5,000-year cycle that

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:19.910 align:middle line:84%
almost universally indigenous
traditions refer to.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:22.754 align:middle line:84%
They call it the Golden
Age or the Age of Peace.

00:36:22.754 --> 00:36:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And there were
cycles before that.

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:25.296 align:middle line:90%
>> Before that, yes.

00:36:25.296 --> 00:36:26.795 align:middle line:84%
>> I cannot say
that scientifically.

00:36:26.795 --> 00:36:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Scientifically, it
cannot be verified,

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.240 align:middle line:90%
but it's been in the lore--

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>> It has.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>> --of every indigenous culture
that they've gone on back

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:34.070 align:middle line:90%
throughout.

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>> At least four cycles,
each cycle 5,000 years long.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.010 align:middle line:84%
At least four of
those in the past.

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:41.810 align:middle line:84%
We can scientifically
validate two of them.

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:45.470 align:middle line:84%
As a geologist, we can
validate the characteristics

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:46.599 align:middle line:90%
of the four cycles.

00:36:46.599 --> 00:36:48.140 align:middle line:84%
But here's why I'm
even sharing this.

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:50.000 align:middle line:84%
This is where it gets
really interesting.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.110 align:middle line:84%
There is a through line
that links all of these

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:57.990 align:middle line:84%
pre-5,000-year cycles
together, civilizations,

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:00.110 align:middle line:90%
and it simply is this.

00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:02.390 align:middle line:84%
In every one of
those sites, there's

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:04.540 align:middle line:90%
no evidence of any weapons.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.880 align:middle line:84%
There's no evidence
of large-scale war.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:12.920 align:middle line:10%
There are no walls surrounding
the homes or the cities

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.710 align:middle line:10%
to protect them
as we find today.

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:16.340 align:middle line:84%
There are no moats
surrounding them.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.290 align:middle line:84%
There are no mass
burials that you

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:21.140 align:middle line:84%
would expect after large-scale
war, no mutilated bodies.

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:25.014 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's true of the
Gulf of Khambhat in India.

00:37:25.014 --> 00:37:26.430 align:middle line:84%
That's true of the
sites in Egypt.

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:28.680 align:middle line:84%
That's true of
the sites in Peru.

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.680 align:middle line:84%
It's true of the
sites in Turkey,

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.170 align:middle line:84%
as well as those through
the Ukraine and Europe

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:34.249 align:middle line:90%
that we're finding.

00:37:34.249 --> 00:37:35.540 align:middle line:90%
One of two things is happening.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Either those things exist
and they haven't been found

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.990 align:middle line:90%
or they're non-existent.

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:45.520 align:middle line:84%
To me, if the
weapons were there,

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.270 align:middle line:84%
if there were evidence
of large-scale war,

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:48.860 align:middle line:84%
I think, in at
least one site, we

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.580 align:middle line:84%
would have found some
shred of evidence.

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that we have
not is leading historians

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:58.940 align:middle line:84%
and archaeologists to rewrite
portions of the history books

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.129 align:middle line:90%
in peer-reviewed articles.

00:38:00.129 --> 00:38:01.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not being shared
in our schools,

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:03.320 align:middle line:90%
but what they're saying is this.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.060 align:middle line:84%
What they're saying
is it appears now

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:08.720 align:middle line:84%
that war is not human nature,
that it's not our nature

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.570 align:middle line:84%
to fight one another
and destroy one another.

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:15.080 align:middle line:84%
That war appears to be a
habit, a very bad habit, that

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:18.380 align:middle line:90%
began about 5,000 years ago.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, during the time
that we say civilization began.

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.890 align:middle line:84%
But before that time,
there's no evidence

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:26.150 align:middle line:90%
of any large-scale war.

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And it suggests that
if war is a habit that

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:31.040 align:middle line:84%
was learned 5,000
years ago, then

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.200 align:middle line:84%
it's a habit that
we can unlearn.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:38.330 align:middle line:84%
The crises of today may force
us to come to that realization,

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:41.630 align:middle line:84%
because the purpose of
war is now obsolete.

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:46.360 align:middle line:84%
The idea that there is someone
that is clearly a winner,

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.741 align:middle line:84%
there's a loser, you know
when the war is over--

00:38:49.741 --> 00:38:51.990 align:middle line:84%
the wars we're looking at
today are not about borders.

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:53.014 align:middle line:90%
They're about ideas.

00:38:53.014 --> 00:38:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think almost every
mother has always known war is

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:57.455 align:middle line:90%
obsolete.

00:38:57.455 --> 00:38:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, and it certainly is now.

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:02.940 align:middle line:84%
So now, we put this into the
context of these deep truths,

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not surprised that
we find no evidence of war,

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:10.340 align:middle line:84%
because it is not in our
deepest nature, survival

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:11.270 align:middle line:90%
of the strongest.

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:14.750 align:middle line:84%
We are, essentially,
a cooperative species.

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:15.770 align:middle line:90%
We can compete.

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:18.200 align:middle line:84%
We can kill each other
and blow one another up,

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.390 align:middle line:84%
we know that, under
certain conditions.

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Where this gets really
even more interesting

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:27.140 align:middle line:84%
is the researchers have found
three conditions, Regina,

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:32.600 align:middle line:84%
they say, under
which we will betray

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:37.310 align:middle line:84%
our truest nature of
cooperation and survival

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:39.710 align:middle line:90%
or cooperation and mutual aid.

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:40.550 align:middle line:90%
Three conditions.

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:44.930 align:middle line:84%
If one or some combination of
these three conditions exist.

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Number one, when we feel
personally threatened,

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:49.430 align:middle line:90%
we can become violent.

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Number two, when we feel that
our families are threatened.

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:56.247 align:middle line:84%
Number three, when we feel that
our way of life is threatened.

00:39:56.247 --> 00:39:57.830 align:middle line:84%
You look at the hot
spots in the world

00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:00.830 align:middle line:84%
today, especially in the
Middle East and Africa,

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:03.979 align:middle line:84%
and not only one of
those but, in many cases,

00:40:03.979 --> 00:40:05.270 align:middle line:90%
all three of those are present.

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:08.310 align:middle line:84%
People feel their lives,
their way of life,

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:10.817 align:middle line:84%
their families are being
threatened right now.

00:40:10.817 --> 00:40:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying it's
right, wrong, good, or bad.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.441 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying at some
point, ultimately,

00:40:14.441 --> 00:40:16.579 align:middle line:84%
if you really want to get
to the bottom of this,

00:40:16.579 --> 00:40:18.120 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have
to address those.

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:22.640 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
useful to know that--

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:26.844 align:middle line:84%
to me, it feels different to
know that war and conflict is

00:40:26.844 --> 00:40:27.760 align:middle line:90%
not our truest nature.

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:31.370 align:middle line:84%
There is a history
book that is used

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:33.597 align:middle line:84%
as a textbook in many
mainstream classrooms today,

00:40:33.597 --> 00:40:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and the first page
of the history book

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:39.110 align:middle line:84%
actually says, quote,
"War is like commerce.

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:41.830 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
all humans do."

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:43.455 align:middle line:84%
So they lead us to
believe that it's

00:40:43.455 --> 00:40:44.790 align:middle line:90%
as natural as night and day.

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:47.800 align:middle line:84%
So we have a generation
of young people--

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.462 align:middle line:84%
war looks very sexy on the
commercials on the television.

00:40:50.462 --> 00:40:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>> They're doing some
feature-length films on it that

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:54.253 align:middle line:84%
are being released,
I think, in March.

00:40:54.253 --> 00:40:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I look them and I
think if I didn't know how it

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:00.710 align:middle line:84%
was being used, that would
be cool a very cool thing.

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:02.234 align:middle line:90%
High tech, very cool.

00:41:02.234 --> 00:41:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Young people are
being conditioned

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:06.470 align:middle line:84%
to believe you've got
to go out and fight

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:08.090 align:middle line:90%
for your piece of the pie.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And you start it
from the early age,

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.820 align:middle line:84%
and you start it
in the classroom

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:11.410 align:middle line:90%
with the kid next to you.

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>> You start it on video
games with little kids.

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>> They do.

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:14.930 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:17.120 align:middle line:90%
So now, again, context.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Here we are, the last year
of a 5,125-year cycle.

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Earth's position in
space has changed,

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:26.420 align:middle line:84%
changes the
conditions that we've

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:27.800 align:middle line:90%
learned to live with on Earth.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.330 align:middle line:90%
And it's forcing us now--

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:31.030 align:middle line:90%
it's forcing our hand.

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:33.350 align:middle line:84%
It's forcing us
to change the way

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:35.942 align:middle line:84%
that we have lived
in the past, the way

00:41:35.942 --> 00:41:38.150 align:middle line:84%
that we solve our problems,
the way we grow our food,

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:41.690 align:middle line:84%
the way we share our resources,
the way we share medicines.

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:44.550 align:middle line:84%
The question is this, and
we're answering it right now,

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:51.880 align:middle line:84%
will we choose cooperation
or competition?

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.140 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a much
more basic question.

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:55.850 align:middle line:84%
I think we're asking
will we choose love,

00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:57.624 align:middle line:90%
or will we choose fear?

00:41:57.624 --> 00:41:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the answer
to that, because we're

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:00.810 align:middle line:90%
making the choice right now.

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:02.490 align:middle line:84%
But I'm encouraged
by what I'm seeing.

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:05.040 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to get
very close to a big war

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:05.840 align:middle line:90%
in the Middle East.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:07.842 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
going to happen.

00:42:07.842 --> 00:42:09.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm encouraged by what
I see behind the scenes.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:14.120 align:middle line:84%
I think the crises are
forcing us to work together

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.340 align:middle line:84%
in ways that we've
never had to, personally

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:19.120 align:middle line:84%
and on a global level,
because we need to now.

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I think what will happen
is when the crises subside,

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:27.024 align:middle line:84%
because we now already
are working together,

00:42:27.024 --> 00:42:28.190 align:middle line:90%
we'll keep working together.

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:30.273 align:middle line:84%
Because we'll find that
we're better people and we

00:42:30.273 --> 00:42:31.590 align:middle line:90%
have a better world.

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, some of the
most beautiful prophecies

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.430 align:middle line:84%
of our ancestors will be
fulfilled, of a new world where

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:39.890 align:middle line:90%
people work together.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:42.300 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying that
we lose our culture

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.310 align:middle line:90%
or our individuality.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:46.100 align:middle line:84%
I think we're always
going to have our culture,

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:47.630 align:middle line:90%
our music, our food.

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:50.965 align:middle line:84%
But I think on a global
level, people-- people ask me,

00:42:50.965 --> 00:42:52.340 align:middle line:84%
they asked me at
this conference,

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.770 align:middle line:84%
are we moving toward
a global government?

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And I say, how would you
know when it happens?

00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:59.750 align:middle line:90%
How would you define that?

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:01.940 align:middle line:90%
We already have global commerce.

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:04.400 align:middle line:84%
We're moving toward a
global financial system.

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:07.550 align:middle line:90%
We've got 24/7 trading.

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:09.330 align:middle line:90%
We've got global security.

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:12.020 align:middle line:84%
We've got global trade
of global resources.

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.690 align:middle line:84%
We're sharing global
medicines, deployment of troops

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:18.050 align:middle line:90%
to help with global crises.

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:19.550 align:middle line:84%
What would have
to happen for you

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:24.230 align:middle line:84%
to say that we have or we
don't have a global government?

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And so then the next
question is people say, well,

00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:28.030 align:middle line:90%
is it a good thing?

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:29.030 align:middle line:90%
And I can't answer that.

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:30.863 align:middle line:84%
I say, I don't know the
answer, because it's

00:43:30.863 --> 00:43:33.050 align:middle line:84%
all about how it
would be implemented.

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:38.420 align:middle line:84%
If we'll learn, as a
planet, to share the things

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:41.930 align:middle line:84%
that every human needs every day
of their lives to be healthy,

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:44.630 align:middle line:90%
vital, thriving humans--

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:48.960 align:middle line:84%
fresh water, clean food,
medicines, and the opportunity

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.440 align:middle line:90%
to create a better life.

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And that is shared
equally, but we still

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.400 align:middle line:84%
retain our culture and our food
and our art and rock and roll

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.500 align:middle line:84%
music and all that stuff,
it can be very cool.

00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:01.160 align:middle line:84%
If globalization is pushed
to a deeper level out

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:06.260 align:middle line:84%
of greed and competition, it
could be a really ugly way

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:07.120 align:middle line:90%
to go.

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And Gregg, is there a
possibility that we're looking

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:13.817 align:middle line:84%
at a potential for both kinds
of outcomes in some way?

00:44:13.817 --> 00:44:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Because you know the
polarization of thought

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:16.450 align:middle line:90%
that's going on.

00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:18.800 align:middle line:84%
There are beautiful things
being given birth to.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>> There are.

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:20.619 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people
that are shifting

00:44:20.619 --> 00:44:21.650 align:middle line:90%
in their consciousness.

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:23.219 align:middle line:84%
Conversely, you
have, I don't know

00:44:23.219 --> 00:44:25.010 align:middle line:84%
if you would say, equal
proportions or not.

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:26.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the percentages.

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>> So, about equal proportions--

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Others going the
other direction.

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:29.453 align:middle line:90%
>> Here's I know, is this.

00:44:29.453 --> 00:44:31.490 align:middle line:84%
When I worked in the
defense industry,

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:35.090 align:middle line:84%
I worked with NASA pretty
closely, and what I found--

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:37.654 align:middle line:84%
listeners know this--
is when you launch

00:44:37.654 --> 00:44:39.320 align:middle line:84%
a rocket or a missile
from Earth and you

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:46.130 align:middle line:84%
go to the moon or Mars,
an angle, a little shift

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:49.946 align:middle line:84%
in the trajectory here on Earth
from where it leaves Earth--

00:44:49.946 --> 00:44:51.320 align:middle line:84%
by the time it
gets to where it's

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.140 align:middle line:84%
going, that little shift
makes a huge difference.

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, indeed.

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a beautiful analogy for
where we're going right now.

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:01.740 align:middle line:84%
We are on a planetary trajectory
based on a way of thinking,

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.200 align:middle line:90%
false assumptions of science.

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Little shifts that we
make in our personal lives

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:11.000 align:middle line:84%
translate into huge
changes in a relatively

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.570 align:middle line:90%
short period of time.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And this idea of cooperation
versus competition, I

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:16.580 align:middle line:90%
think it's the place to begin.

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And looking at it from
a spiritual point of view

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:23.359 align:middle line:84%
in overlay to this,
in the Isaiah Effect,

00:45:23.359 --> 00:45:25.650 align:middle line:84%
which I read when it came
out, and we've talked about--

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:26.570 align:middle line:90%
>> You read my book.

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:26.840 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course I've read--

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:28.640 align:middle line:84%
I think I've read
all your books.

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And with the Isaiah Effect,
we're looking at the notion

00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:36.770 align:middle line:84%
that a certain percentage
equals a tipping point.

00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:39.440 align:middle line:10%
But you were speaking
of a certain percentage

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.890 align:middle line:10%
and tipping point of people who
are elevating their thinking

00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:44.900 align:middle line:10%
and their intention and
their understanding.

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.182 align:middle line:90%
>> You know, in the old days--

00:45:46.182 --> 00:45:47.640 align:middle line:84%
and this was that
book was written,

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.394 align:middle line:84%
the Isaiah Effect
was written, in 1998.

00:45:49.394 --> 00:45:50.435 align:middle line:90%
It was published in 2000.

00:45:50.435 --> 00:45:54.020 align:middle line:10%
It based on studies that were
done in the '80s and the '90s,

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:55.470 align:middle line:10%
where the scientists
were thinking

00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:59.000 align:middle line:10%
in a linear fashion, that took
a certain number of people

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.530 align:middle line:10%
that we would call
the hundredth monkey

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:03.550 align:middle line:10%
idea to tip these scales.

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, scientists are telling us
quantum understandings tell us

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.800 align:middle line:84%
it's not about the
numbers of people,

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.465 align:middle line:90%
but it's about the quality--

00:46:10.465 --> 00:46:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>> That's where
I was going next.

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>> --of the experience that
relatively few people actually

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:15.690 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so that was going
to be the extension.

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:22.530 align:middle line:84%
You have this, and then
now, the quality of love,

00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:24.120 align:middle line:90%
the quality of--

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:27.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't like hope as in a
term of something that's

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:30.480 align:middle line:84%
to be aspired to, but genuine
feeling in your being,

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:34.170 align:middle line:84%
in your cells, that we're on
the turn for the better, fueled

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:37.350 align:middle line:84%
by love, is such a high
frequency that, in the end,

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:40.660 align:middle line:84%
is this what you're saying,
that frequency essentially

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:41.460 align:middle line:90%
will dominate?

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>> What I think is
happening is this.

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.290 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the world
that we've known in the past

00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:47.800 align:middle line:90%
is gone.

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And for those who are
clinging to a way of life that

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:56.286 align:middle line:84%
no longer exists and are
working to get back to that,

00:46:56.286 --> 00:46:57.660 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
the ones that are

00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:01.260 align:middle line:84%
having the greatest struggle,
the greatest suffering.

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.360 align:middle line:84%
So the world of
the past is gone.

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:06.450 align:middle line:84%
We cannot go back to it,
because it no longer exists.

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:08.170 align:middle line:84%
We're moving
forward with change.

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:08.970 align:middle line:90%
That is a fact.

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:09.870 align:middle line:90%
Are we going to stop it?

00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:10.670 align:middle line:90%
Probably not.

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:11.730 align:middle line:90%
That's a fact.

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:13.500 align:middle line:90%
Can we direct the change?

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:14.490 align:middle line:90%
I believe we can.

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Can we soften the
impact of how that

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.250 align:middle line:84%
change lands in our personal
and our collective lives?

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:22.289 align:middle line:84%
The evidence suggests
that we can, strongly.

00:47:22.289 --> 00:47:24.330 align:middle line:84%
So let me just say this
briefly, and I don't know

00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:26.414 align:middle line:84%
how we're doing on
our time here, but--

00:47:26.414 --> 00:47:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>> We've got about 10.

00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:32.800 align:middle line:90%
Let me share a story.

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:37.770 align:middle line:84%
I was in Australia over
9/11 and couldn't get back

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:39.000 align:middle line:90%
in my own country.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.440 align:middle line:90%
Planes weren't flying.

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And when they did, I came back,
and just a few days later, I

00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:48.770 align:middle line:84%
was actually in Paris,
France, right after 9/11.

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was with an
audience of 3,500 people.

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And there was one man in the
audience, a Frenchman, who

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:55.170 align:middle line:90%
was very angry about something.

00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:56.711 align:middle line:84%
Security came in,
and they were going

00:47:56.711 --> 00:47:58.860 align:middle line:90%
to kick him out of the venue.

00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:00.450 align:middle line:84%
I believe there
are no accidents.

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:01.855 align:middle line:90%
So I said, don't kick him out.

00:48:01.855 --> 00:48:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I said, if you want
to ask him to stand

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.900 align:middle line:90%
in the hall for three minutes.

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Ask him just to
wait in the hall.

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And while he was gone
in those three minutes,

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:16.280 align:middle line:84%
the 3,499 people now left
in the 3,500-seat audience,

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:21.060 align:middle line:84%
we went through an exercise
creating what's called

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:23.650 align:middle line:84%
coherence between the
heart and the brain.

00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:26.640 align:middle line:84%
It is scientifically
proven to be

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:28.680 align:middle line:84%
the core of some of
our most spiritual

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:30.810 align:middle line:90%
and ancient traditions.

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:33.780 align:middle line:84%
It's about setting up
communication between the heart

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:37.500 align:middle line:84%
and the brain of a very
low frequency, 0.10 hertz.

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:40.740 align:middle line:90%
Heart-brain coherence.

00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:41.710 align:middle line:90%
It's very easy to do.

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:42.190 align:middle line:90%
It's based on--

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:43.356 align:middle line:90%
>> Heart Math works on this.

00:48:43.356 --> 00:48:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>> It's what we
do in our hearts,

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.520 align:middle line:84%
and it's based on studies,
now scientifically proven,

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:50.070 align:middle line:84%
through the Institute
of Heart Math.

00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:51.245 align:middle line:90%
I think Howard Martin--

00:48:51.245 --> 00:48:53.050 align:middle line:84%
I believe you've
interviewed Howard Martin.

00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>> No, we have not
gotten together yet.

00:48:54.810 --> 00:48:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, he's a dear brother,
colleague, and friend.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Please put in a word.

00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And the person that can make
that happen is in the room with

00:48:59.490 --> 00:48:59.960 align:middle line:90%
us now.

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:00.413 align:middle line:90%
>> Is you.

00:49:00.413 --> 00:49:01.560 align:middle line:90%
Would you please?

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:02.500 align:middle line:90%
>> We will.

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I've done Heart--

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:03.890 align:middle line:90%
I have done that.

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:05.765 align:middle line:84%
>> He's here this week,
and I'd like for you,

00:49:05.765 --> 00:49:06.900 align:middle line:90%
if you can talk to him.

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:08.490 align:middle line:90%
Here's the key.

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Coherence is easy to achieve,
and it is measurable.

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And when we establish
heart-brain coherence

00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:19.830 align:middle line:84%
based upon experiences
that are taught in some

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:24.720 align:middle line:84%
are most cherished and ancient
spiritual traditions, what

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.250 align:middle line:90%
we do is we set up a field.

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:29.940 align:middle line:84%
We couple the magnetic
field of the human heart

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:32.340 align:middle line:84%
with the magnetic
field of the Earth that

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:33.750 align:middle line:90%
connects and sustains all life.

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So it is a marriage
of us with this field.

00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:42.690 align:middle line:84%
So in this room, ballroom in
Paris, I invited the group

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:45.030 align:middle line:84%
and shared with them
very simple instructions

00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:47.252 align:middle line:84%
to set up a coherent
field in the room.

00:49:47.252 --> 00:49:48.210 align:middle line:90%
And you can measure it.

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:50.180 align:middle line:90%
We know it was actually there.

00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Then, we invited the
Frenchman to come back in,

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.130 align:middle line:90%
gave him a microphone.

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Through the translator,
because my French is terrible,

00:49:56.130 --> 00:49:59.035 align:middle line:84%
I asked him, I said, tell
us what your experience is.

00:49:59.035 --> 00:49:59.910 align:middle line:90%
What are you feeling?

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And he had the strangest
look on his face.

00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And he said, through
the translator,

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:06.490 align:middle line:84%
he said, in my mind,
I know why I'm angry.

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:08.430 align:middle line:84%
He says, but I can't
feel the anger.

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:11.180 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't access the emotion.

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not surprised,
because in a coherent field,

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:18.690 align:middle line:84%
the emotion of anger and
hate and jealousy and rage

00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:21.690 align:middle line:84%
that fuels competition,
that is no longer present.

00:50:21.690 --> 00:50:23.954 align:middle line:84%
You can think about it,
but you can't feel it.

00:50:23.954 --> 00:50:26.370 align:middle line:84%
The reason I'm sharing that
story is because what happened

00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:28.080 align:middle line:84%
in that room with
that man can happen

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:30.300 align:middle line:90%
on a planet between nations.

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:34.200 align:middle line:84%
It's really hard for
a leader of any nation

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:37.590 align:middle line:84%
to declare war on their neighbor
when you're not feeling it.

00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:40.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can talk to
your Joint Chiefs of Staff,

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:43.590 align:middle line:84%
and you can say, hey, guys,
I'm just not feeling it.

00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:49.050 align:middle line:84%
It's really hard to declare
a violent competition

00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:50.550 align:middle line:90%
of any kind.

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And this, I think, is one of
the greatest hopes in our world

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:55.820 align:middle line:84%
today, because there
is no them and us

00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:56.750 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to this field.

00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:57.550 align:middle line:90%
There's a we.

00:50:57.550 --> 00:51:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Every CEO of every corporation,
every leader of every nation,

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:03.860 align:middle line:84%
every blade of grass, every
hamster, every goldfish,

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:07.790 align:middle line:84%
every dog, every cat is
linked to this field.

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:10.520 align:middle line:84%
The question is, what
do we-- because we're

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:13.310 align:middle line:84%
linked to it every day,
what do we feed the field?

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:15.829 align:middle line:84%
What do we have to nurture
and nourish this field with?

00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where it gets
really tricky, Regina.

00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:20.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm being careful about this.

00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:22.940 align:middle line:84%
People ask me if I was
supporting the Occupy Movement

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:25.580 align:middle line:90%
as it existed in the early days.

00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And I said to them,
very honestly,

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:30.410 align:middle line:90%
the system is definitely broken.

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:33.790 align:middle line:90%
We definitely need a new system.

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:37.610 align:middle line:84%
I am all about, and will always
work for, positive change,

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:41.390 align:middle line:84%
but you will never see me
fight against or protest

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:44.990 align:middle line:84%
against something
for this very reason.

00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:46.880 align:middle line:90%
There's a field out there.

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:49.340 align:middle line:84%
The field doesn't
know the specifics.

00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:51.650 align:middle line:84%
It gets the general
patterns of energy.

00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:54.470 align:middle line:84%
When we're protesting against
something, what we're doing

00:51:54.470 --> 00:52:00.620 align:middle line:84%
is causing a very incohesive
disruption in this field that

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:03.020 align:middle line:90%
agitates and upsets people.

00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:06.140 align:middle line:84%
So I will work to create
a field of coherence

00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:07.910 align:middle line:90%
toward positive change.

00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:10.010 align:middle line:84%
I would never tear
down something

00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:12.830 align:middle line:84%
that is already existing,
because from my perspective,

00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:15.170 align:middle line:84%
my understanding and what
I know now to be true,

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:17.850 align:middle line:84%
it actually defeats
the very purpose

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:20.210 align:middle line:84%
and actually supports
the conditions

00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:22.742 align:middle line:90%
that we would like to change.

00:52:22.742 --> 00:52:24.450 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if I
said that OK or not.

00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>> No, no, that was, to
me, that was perfectly put.

00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:30.050 align:middle line:90%
And that is at the crux of it.

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Because we're all now having
to take in so much information,

00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:35.270 align:middle line:84%
evaluate, look at
what doesn't work.

00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:38.055 align:middle line:84%
And naturally, it attracts
anger in a lot of people--

00:52:38.055 --> 00:52:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I understand that.

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:40.596 align:middle line:84%
>> --when you find
you've been deceived.

00:52:40.596 --> 00:52:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I understand that.

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Your resources have
been misallocated.

00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:45.800 align:middle line:90%
People get upset about it.

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.660 align:middle line:90%
But still, the temptation--

00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:50.570 align:middle line:84%
I know the temptation is there
to want to lash out and indulge

00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:51.437 align:middle line:90%
in these feelings.

00:52:51.437 --> 00:52:52.520 align:middle line:90%
It's not helping anything.

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Now that we know the
relationships when we create

00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:57.150 align:middle line:90%
those kinds of emotions--

00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:58.940 align:middle line:84%
just, you can think
of it this way.

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:02.150 align:middle line:84%
When the tsunami happened in
Japan or the nuclear meltdown

00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:05.810 align:middle line:84%
or the stock market
collapses, there

00:53:05.810 --> 00:53:09.860 align:middle line:84%
is a wave, a shockwave,
that goes through the field

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:10.740 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And we all feel that
in one way or another.

00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Coherence can offset
that a little bit

00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:18.020 align:middle line:84%
and maybe help even out
some of those rough edges.

00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:21.860 align:middle line:84%
When people are protesting
against something

00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:24.020 align:middle line:84%
that they don't
believe in, the field

00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:29.210 align:middle line:84%
doesn't make a distinction
between their beliefs and--

00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:32.570 align:middle line:84%
all the field knows is there is
an agitation from their protest

00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:34.440 align:middle line:84%
that's now being put
out into the field.

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:39.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is where if we're really
conscious of our relationship

00:53:39.110 --> 00:53:43.550 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth and to one
another and if we really

00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:46.550 align:middle line:84%
understand these principles,
this is what's different now.

00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Relatively few people can
anchor a very powerful field

00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:54.320 align:middle line:84%
of coherence that smooths out
some of those rough edges.

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think when it
comes down to making

00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:59.480 align:middle line:84%
those choices, somebody
sitting in a room

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:01.150 align:middle line:84%
halfway around the
world saying, are we

00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:04.970 align:middle line:90%
going to go to war or not?

00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:08.510 align:middle line:84%
It's really hard
to go to war when,

00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:10.850 align:middle line:84%
in the field of
coherence, you're

00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:18.584 align:middle line:84%
feeling the desire for
peace and cooperation.

00:54:18.584 --> 00:54:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the
studies have shown.

00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:22.020 align:middle line:84%
In the presence of
coherence, we're

00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:26.460 align:middle line:84%
much less violent, much
more willing to cooperate,

00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:28.110 align:middle line:90%
much less warlike.

00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:29.670 align:middle line:90%
Plus, it's healthy for us.

00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:30.490 align:middle line:90%
It's good for us.

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a personal choice.

00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:33.960 align:middle line:90%
Coherence, individual coherence.

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:35.520 align:middle line:84%
It strengthens
our immune system.

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Kicks those anti-aging
hormones in--

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:38.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm 600 years old.

00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Don't look a day
over 500, right?

00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:41.380 align:middle line:90%
Not a day over.

00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:43.032 align:middle line:90%
I'd have pegged you for 480.

00:54:43.032 --> 00:54:44.328 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:54:44.328 --> 00:54:45.900 align:middle line:90%
It's good for us personally.

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And now we're
understanding what is

00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:50.420 align:middle line:84%
good for us personally
extends beyond our bodies

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:53.700 align:middle line:84%
and, collectively, is good
for our world, as well.

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:57.000 align:middle line:84%
So I think as we bring
all-- and we've only

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.790 align:middle line:84%
gone through a few
of the deep truths.

00:54:58.790 --> 00:55:01.300 align:middle line:84%
There's so much more, and I
know I have, as you can see,

00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:02.700 align:middle line:90%
a list that's filled here--

00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so question number two.

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>> --this entire page.

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.720 align:middle line:90%
No, we don't--

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:05.553 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm just kidding.

00:55:05.553 --> 00:55:06.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm just kidding.

00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>> We do not have time.

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.640 align:middle line:84%
However, people that
are watching this

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:10.470 align:middle line:84%
do have time to pick
up the book and then

00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:11.595 align:middle line:90%
go ahead and read the rest.

00:55:11.595 --> 00:55:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for that.

00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:15.810 align:middle line:84%
So I think the thing
that people ask me--

00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:17.460 align:middle line:90%
this is now 2012.

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And our office was
inundated the first couple

00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:24.850 align:middle line:84%
of days of the year, Gregg
2012, what's your message?

00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:26.490 align:middle line:90%
What can you say?

00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think it all comes down,
there's a question that we all

00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:33.030 align:middle line:84%
ask ourselves every day, and a
little shift in this question,

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:34.660 align:middle line:84%
I think, is the
key to everything

00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:36.660 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about here.

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:39.390 align:middle line:84%
The question is simply
this, how can we

00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:44.310 align:middle line:84%
make the shift from the
question what can I get

00:55:44.310 --> 00:55:46.151 align:middle line:90%
from the world that exists--

00:55:46.151 --> 00:55:48.400 align:middle line:84%
that's the question we've
been asking for a long time.

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.910 align:middle line:84%
If we can shift from
that into asking,

00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:54.330 align:middle line:84%
what can I give to the
world that's emerging?

00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:59.280 align:middle line:84%
The way we answer that very
subtle question opens the door

00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:03.540 align:middle line:84%
to the possibilities of
career, jobs, opportunities,

00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:07.540 align:middle line:84%
cooperation that maybe we've
never even thought of before.

00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:09.660 align:middle line:84%
What can I give to the
world that's emerging,

00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:11.659 align:middle line:84%
rather than what can I
get from the world that's

00:56:11.659 --> 00:56:12.540 align:middle line:90%
already out there?

00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And I look forward to
exploring that answer with you,

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:16.230 align:middle line:90%
with our listeners.

00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Come back in 2013, and
we'll talk about 2012, OK?

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>> We seem to meet
each other once a year,

00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and thank you very much
for closing on that note.

00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:24.160 align:middle line:90%

Gregg is very clear that
we need to take a deep look

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:40.780 align:middle line:84%
into our history and evolve
our thinking if we're
