00:00:01.274 --> 00:00:03.282 line:15% 
<v ->As we continue our exploration of money</v>

2
00:00:03.282 --> 00:00:05.574 line:15% 
and the economy, we speak with Ellen Brown,

3
00:00:05.574 --> 00:00:07.594 line:15% 
author of the book, and website,

4
00:00:07.594 --> 00:00:09.046 line:15% 
Web of Debt.

5
00:00:09.046 --> 00:00:10.656 line:15% 
Ellen writes extensively on the history

6
00:00:10.656 --> 00:00:12.656 line:15% 
of money and what needs to be done to break

7
00:00:12.656 --> 00:00:14.836 line:15% 
the cartel that is known as the Federal Reserve

8
00:00:14.836 --> 00:00:16.666 line:15% 
Banking System.

9
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.835 line:15% 
She gives a compact history lesson on money here,

10
00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:20.935 line:15% 
reaching back to the days of Benjamin Franklin

11
00:00:20.935 --> 00:00:23.315 line:15% 
in early America, where he was instrumental

12
00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:25.855 line:15% 
in setting up a public bank in Pennsylvania,

13
00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:28.685 line:15% 
that sounds much like what we need today.

14
00:00:36.458 --> 00:00:38.658 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>So I don't think it's a surprise to anybody</v>

15
00:00:38.658 --> 00:00:40.918 line:15% 
that we have some severe economic woes

16
00:00:40.918 --> 00:00:43.518 line:15% 
running in the background of our lives here,

17
00:00:43.518 --> 00:00:45.518 line:15% 
certainly in America, but in much of the west

18
00:00:45.518 --> 00:00:47.958 line:15% 
and even trickling out to all corners

19
00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.638 line:15% 
of the planet right now.

20
00:00:49.638 --> 00:00:52.558 line:15% 
And the presentation that you gave yesterday,

21
00:00:52.558 --> 00:00:54.158 line:15% 
what I love, we've talked to you before

22
00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:56.978 line:15% 
on my radio show, but what I really love about

23
00:00:56.978 --> 00:01:01.038 line:15% 
this is your detailing of how this crazy

24
00:01:01.038 --> 00:01:04.078 line:15% 
unsustainable system was foisted upon

25
00:01:04.078 --> 00:01:05.238 line:15% 
the people to begin with.

26
00:01:05.238 --> 00:01:08.038 line:15% 
So if you don't mind, Ellen, let's go back

27
00:01:08.038 --> 00:01:11.218 line:15% 
to the 17th century and how this thing

28
00:01:11.218 --> 00:01:13.858 line:15% 
known as fractionalized reserve banking

29
00:01:13.858 --> 00:01:18.148 line:15% 
began and what the danger in this is to us now.

30
00:01:18.839 --> 00:01:21.959 line:15% 
<v ->Before the 17th century, it was the sovereign</v>

31
00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:24.199 line:15% 
right of the king or queen to create money.

32
00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:26.839 line:15% 
No one, no individual could do it.

33
00:01:26.839 --> 00:01:29.319 line:15% 
And then in 1666 there was the passage

34
00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.350 line:15% 
of the Coinage Act which allowed private

35
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.360 line:15% 
coinage of money.

36
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.280 line:15% 
So the goldsmiths were coining, making coins

37
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.400 line:15% 
for people, and people would leave their

38
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.760 line:15% 
money with the goldsmiths for safekeeping,

39
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.620 line:15% 
but they didn't necessarily want to carry,

40
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.220 line:15% 
they didn't want to carry this heavy gold around,

41
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.091 line:15% 
and so the goldsmiths would give them these

42
00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:50.641 line:15% 
little paper receipts, called bank notes.

43
00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:52.421 line:15% 
When they became banks, they called them

44
00:01:52.421 --> 00:01:53.801 line:15% 
bank notes.

45
00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:55.581 line:15% 
And meanwhile, other people would want

46
00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:57.078 line:15% 
to borrow those receipts,

47
00:01:57.078 --> 00:01:58.969 line:15% 
or they'd want to borrow gold, but they didn't want

48
00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:00.948 line:15% 
to carry the gold around either because

49
00:02:00.948 --> 00:02:03.578 line:15% 
it's heavy, it was dangerous, people might rob you.

50
00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:06.059 line:15% 
So everybody preferred trading in these little

51
00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:07.490 line:15% 
paper receipts.

52
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.740 line:15% 
So, the goldsmiths would then give them these

53
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.840 line:15% 
receipts which were supposedly redeemable

54
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.580 line:15% 
in gold, and they quickly discovered that they

55
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.840 line:15% 
could lend 10 times as many notes, up to

56
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.740 line:15% 
10 times as many notes as they actually had

57
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.700 line:15% 
gold because most people only came

58
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.420 line:15% 
for their gold 10 percent of the time, and

59
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.180 line:15% 
therefore, basically, 90 percent of these

60
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.060 line:15% 
notes were counterfeit.

61
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.652 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>So in essence, only they could</v>

62
00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:34.614 line:15% 
count on the fact that at any given time

63
00:02:34.614 --> 00:02:36.594 line:15% 
only 10 percent of the money would be

64
00:02:36.594 --> 00:02:40.114 line:15% 
called in, the gold coins would be called in.

65
00:02:40.114 --> 00:02:42.307 line:15% 
<v ->Right, that people would actually come for their gold.</v>

66
00:02:42.307 --> 00:02:44.417 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>This is very dishonest.</v>

67
00:02:44.417 --> 00:02:47.209 line:15% 
<v ->And that is the same system we have today.</v>

68
00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.899 line:15% 
10 percent fractional reserve system, where

69
00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:53.379 line:15% 
technically you're supposed to have 10 percent

70
00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.709 line:15% 
in the bank for backing however much you lend.

71
00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:03.213 line:15% 
So banks, actually create 90 percent of their

72
00:03:03.213 --> 00:03:05.073 line:15% 
loans on their books.

73
00:03:05.073 --> 00:03:07.233 line:15% 
Well, actually they create 100 percent of their

74
00:03:07.233 --> 00:03:08.655 line:15% 
loans on their books, because they take in your

75
00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:11.075 line:15% 
deposit, they don't lend out your deposit.

76
00:03:11.075 --> 00:03:13.175 line:15% 
You never go into your bank and they say,

77
00:03:13.175 --> 00:03:14.215 line:15% 
"I'm sorry."

78
00:03:14.215 --> 00:03:15.578 line:15% 
You know, you ask for your money and they say,

79
00:03:15.578 --> 00:03:17.599 line:15% 
"I'm sorry, we just lent that to Mr. Smith,

80
00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.580 line:15% 
"and you can have it back in 30 years."

81
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.260 line:15% 
You always can get your money.

82
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.960 line:15% 
Your money stays in the bank.

83
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.840 line:15% 
They're using that as the base, or the reserves

84
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.840 line:15% 
against which they issue 90 percent of their

85
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.083 line:15% 
deposits and then the loans they create become

86
00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:39.063 line:15% 
a deposit which then increases their deposit base

87
00:03:39.063 --> 00:03:41.223 line:15% 
so they can lend 90 percent of that and 90

88
00:03:41.223 --> 00:03:42.503 line:15% 
percent of that.

89
00:03:42.503 --> 00:03:45.823 line:15% 
In the end, you've got 10 dollars of deposits,

90
00:03:45.823 --> 00:03:48.103 line:15% 
can support 100 dollars in loans.

91
00:03:49.075 --> 00:03:50.265 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>So this has been going on since the</v>

92
00:03:50.265 --> 00:03:52.036 line:15% 
17th century?

93
00:03:52.036 --> 00:03:53.536 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah.</v>

94
00:03:53.592 --> 00:03:57.136 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>And where, what are the</v>

95
00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:59.096 line:15% 
implications in the mess that we're seeing

96
00:03:59.096 --> 00:04:01.156 line:15% 
today of this kind of banking?

97
00:04:01.156 --> 00:04:02.716 line:15% 
What has actually occurred by way

98
00:04:02.716 --> 00:04:05.326 line:15% 
of even more extreme abuses?

99
00:04:05.326 --> 00:04:06.857 line:15% 
'Cause this system is set up for abuses,

100
00:04:06.857 --> 00:04:10.361 line:15% 
to begin with because it's very dishonest

101
00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:12.762 line:15% 
system at it's core.

102
00:04:12.762 --> 00:04:15.129 line:15% 
Unsustainable for sure.

103
00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.929 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah.</v>

104
00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:20.222 line:15% 
So, because the banks, the banks actually

105
00:04:20.222 --> 00:04:22.582 line:15% 
got around this fractional reserve requirement

106
00:04:22.582 --> 00:04:24.862 line:15% 
which was set by the Federal Reserve,

107
00:04:24.862 --> 00:04:27.082 line:15% 
and so another organization called the

108
00:04:27.082 --> 00:04:30.033 line:15% 
Bank for International Settlements, a private,

109
00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:31.863 line:15% 
the private head of the private central banking

110
00:04:31.863 --> 00:04:34.223 line:15% 
system in Basel, Switzerland, came out

111
00:04:34.223 --> 00:04:37.763 line:15% 
with these capital requirements which said,

112
00:04:37.763 --> 00:04:39.843 line:15% 
they're very complicated, but it's like,

113
00:04:39.843 --> 00:04:42.303 line:15% 
they're risk weighted, and there's, you need

114
00:04:42.303 --> 00:04:44.423 line:15% 
like four percent tier one capital and eight

115
00:04:44.423 --> 00:04:47.203 line:15% 
percent tier one plus tier two capital,

116
00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:49.643 line:15% 
but basically the bottom line is that the bank

117
00:04:49.643 --> 00:04:51.143 line:15% 
for international settlements was saying

118
00:04:51.143 --> 00:04:53.223 line:15% 
you need to have some real capital here

119
00:04:53.223 --> 00:04:56.033 line:15% 
against which you create your loans.

120
00:04:56.563 --> 00:05:00.843 line:15% 
So, places like Japan did it that way

121
00:05:00.843 --> 00:05:05.503 line:15% 
and the Japanese banks when the Basel One

122
00:05:05.503 --> 00:05:08.123 line:15% 
accords came out in 1988, the Japanese

123
00:05:08.123 --> 00:05:11.643 line:15% 
banks were crushed by this new capital requirement,

124
00:05:11.643 --> 00:05:13.803 line:15% 
but the US, the Wall Street banks

125
00:05:13.803 --> 00:05:15.455 line:15% 
which were like the international banks

126
00:05:15.455 --> 00:05:17.200 line:15% 
are international banks,

127
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.620 line:15% 
got around it by selling off their loans

128
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.109 line:15% 
to investors.

129
00:05:22.109 --> 00:05:23.449 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>So this was truly an unfair</v>

130
00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.889 line:15% 
advantage, in a sense, over the Japanese

131
00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.559 line:15% 
banks who were trying to comply at that time.

132
00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.669 line:15% 
<v ->Right, actually I'm not sure why</v>

133
00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.649 line:15% 
the Japanese banks didn't do the same thing

134
00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:35.189 line:15% 
our banks did, but anyway, that's what

135
00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:36.129 line:15% 
our banks did.

136
00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:38.969 line:15% 
Was that they securitized their loans.

137
00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:43.469 line:15% 
So, that's why they got into all this subprime,

138
00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:46.069 line:15% 
'cause who cares whether they're risky loans

139
00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:48.249 line:15% 
if you're gonna sell them off to investors.

140
00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:50.069 line:15% 
So you don't have them on your books anymore

141
00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:51.942 line:15% 
you're no longer responsible for them.

142
00:05:51.942 --> 00:05:55.873 line:15% 
So they separated, it used to be, it was your

143
00:05:55.873 --> 00:05:59.140 line:15% 
bank that held your loan for 30 years,

144
00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.120 line:15% 
of course the bank would make sure that you

145
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.760 line:15% 
were gonna pay it back and they only made

146
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.960 line:15% 
responsible loans.

147
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.460 line:15% 
But once they figured out that they could

148
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.641 line:15% 
just get rid of these loans, they would make

149
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:10.020 line:15% 
a loan to anybody that walked in the door.

150
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.400 line:15% 
Because they got all these fees and commissions

151
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.340 line:15% 
and bonuses.

152
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.460 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>And that's where they were really</v>

153
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.211 line:15% 
making their money, then they sell all of the package

154
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:19.786 line:15% 
of loans off, they off them to some other entity,

155
00:06:19.786 --> 00:06:21.357 line:15% 
mortgage entity or something.

156
00:06:21.847 --> 00:06:24.628 line:15% 
<v ->Right, and ultimately they'd be sold to</v>

157
00:06:24.628 --> 00:06:25.868 line:15% 
a pool of investors.

158
00:06:25.868 --> 00:06:28.808 line:15% 
So if you get the investors to buy, they wrap

159
00:06:28.808 --> 00:06:31.208 line:15% 
them, they said, don't worry there may be some

160
00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:33.869 line:15% 
dodgy collateral in here, but we've sold off

161
00:06:33.869 --> 00:06:36.429 line:15% 
the risk to this other set of investors, and these

162
00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:39.749 line:15% 
are the derivatives, where they sold

163
00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:43.051 line:15% 
credit default swaps off to usually hedge funds.

164
00:06:43.051 --> 00:06:44.512 line:15% 
But what nobody checked to see

165
00:06:44.512 --> 00:06:46.764 line:15% 
was whether the hedge funds really had the money.

166
00:06:46.764 --> 00:06:48.254 line:15% 
I mean they're all just gambling.

167
00:06:48.254 --> 00:06:50.134 line:15% 
So the hedge funds are gambling that

168
00:06:50.134 --> 00:06:52.734 line:15% 
they're not going to have widespread default.

169
00:06:52.734 --> 00:06:54.374 line:15% 
And if they do, they think, "Oh well,

170
00:06:54.374 --> 00:06:55.914 line:15% 
we'll just go bankrupt."

171
00:06:55.914 --> 00:06:58.168 line:15% 
And you know, they'll step away from the corporate veil so

172
00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:00.208 line:15% 
they'll get to keep their winnings for the

173
00:07:00.208 --> 00:07:01.888 line:15% 
previous seven or eight years.

174
00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:03.319 line:15% 
I mean, that's what did happen.

175
00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:03.769 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

176
00:07:03.769 --> 00:07:06.091 line:15% 
<v ->That when the two Bear Stearns hedge funds</v>

177
00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:08.431 line:15% 
collapsed in the summer of 2007, that was

178
00:07:08.431 --> 00:07:11.911 line:15% 
the beginning of the end of this whole system,

179
00:07:11.911 --> 00:07:13.971 line:15% 
but up till then they'd made a lot of money.

180
00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:16.111 line:15% 
And nobody's gone to jail, I mean they all

181
00:07:16.111 --> 00:07:17.971 line:15% 
went home with their money and they said,

182
00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:19.391 line:15% 
"OK, you're right, we don't have the money,

183
00:07:19.391 --> 00:07:20.881 line:15% 
"we're bankrupt."

184
00:07:21.391 --> 00:07:23.111 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>I don't know if this is a fair thing</v>

185
00:07:23.111 --> 00:07:25.311 line:15% 
to ask, but percentage wise, from your

186
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:27.331 line:15% 
knowledge and research, what would you guess

187
00:07:27.331 --> 00:07:29.531 line:15% 
are the actual percentage of some of the

188
00:07:29.531 --> 00:07:31.971 line:15% 
dodgy stuff that was in those portfolios

189
00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:33.741 line:15% 
that were offed?

190
00:07:34.611 --> 00:07:37.731 line:15% 
<v ->I don't know, but I did see a very interesting</v>

191
00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:39.951 line:15% 
thing about how they did it in tranches.

192
00:07:39.951 --> 00:07:40.703 line:15% 
Have you seen that?

193
00:07:40.703 --> 00:07:41.571 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Uh huh.</v>

194
00:07:41.571 --> 00:07:44.071 line:15% 
<v ->Where, say you have, in theory you have</v>

195
00:07:44.071 --> 00:07:46.831 line:15% 
your triple A investments, which is, you've

196
00:07:46.831 --> 00:07:51.231 line:15% 
got this whole pool of home loans, and some

197
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:52.891 line:15% 
of them will go into default.

198
00:07:52.891 --> 00:07:54.811 line:15% 
I mean, like all of them, pretty much

199
00:07:54.811 --> 00:07:57.391 line:15% 
all of them were risky loans.

200
00:07:57.391 --> 00:07:59.731 line:15% 
But only a few of them would go into

201
00:07:59.731 --> 00:08:03.411 line:15% 
default, of course, there's only statistical odds.

202
00:08:03.411 --> 00:08:05.811 line:15% 
So the theory was that the triple A's were

203
00:08:05.811 --> 00:08:09.571 line:15% 
all the, that the triple B's, the riskiest

204
00:08:09.571 --> 00:08:11.591 line:15% 
investments, they would get the ones that

205
00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:13.911 line:15% 
went into default first.

206
00:08:13.911 --> 00:08:16.171 line:15% 
That's one reason they had a paper trail

207
00:08:16.171 --> 00:08:18.771 line:15% 
problem because nobody really knew which

208
00:08:18.771 --> 00:08:21.891 line:15% 
homes belonged to which investors until

209
00:08:21.891 --> 00:08:22.723 line:15% 
they defaulted.

210
00:08:22.723 --> 00:08:23.586 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

211
00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:24.750 line:15% 
<v ->So then when they defaulted,</v>

212
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.943 line:15% 
the triple B people got the bad home loans,

213
00:08:26.943 --> 00:08:29.923 line:15% 
and supposedly these triple A's would never

214
00:08:29.923 --> 00:08:30.903 line:15% 
go into default.

215
00:08:30.903 --> 00:08:33.523 line:15% 
But of course what happened was they all,

216
00:08:33.523 --> 00:08:37.173 line:15% 
the whole thing was infected.

217
00:08:37.663 --> 00:08:40.103 line:15% 
And then also, when people no longer

218
00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:42.203 line:15% 
trusted those credit default swaps to

219
00:08:42.203 --> 00:08:44.263 line:15% 
protect them against risk, the buyers

220
00:08:44.263 --> 00:08:45.943 line:15% 
just quit buying.

221
00:08:45.943 --> 00:08:47.503 line:15% 
So that whole, it was called the

222
00:08:47.503 --> 00:08:49.283 line:15% 
shadow lenders, that whole secondary

223
00:08:49.283 --> 00:08:52.163 line:15% 
market for home loans has gone away.

224
00:08:52.163 --> 00:08:54.363 line:15% 
And that's why we've had a huge credit freeze

225
00:08:54.363 --> 00:08:57.233 line:15% 
and a huge depression, or recession.

226
00:08:57.783 --> 00:09:00.783 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>So it's a multi-tiered problem, but</v>

227
00:09:00.783 --> 00:09:03.863 line:15% 
certainly something, one of the aspects of that

228
00:09:03.863 --> 00:09:07.834 line:15% 
is that we can't get credit as we could even a year ago.

229
00:09:07.834 --> 00:09:10.160 line:15% 
So, this is a big issue in terms of starting

230
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.830 line:15% 
to freeze down the economy.

231
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.550 line:15% 
And then secondly, because of the loans

232
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.510 line:15% 
that were being made that are now called

233
00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.837 line:15% 
toxic assets, those loans are never going

234
00:09:18.837 --> 00:09:19.657 line:15% 
to be paid off.

235
00:09:19.657 --> 00:09:21.417 line:15% 
Those are in default.

236
00:09:21.417 --> 00:09:25.877 line:15% 
Thirdly, we're not really seeing, we haven't

237
00:09:25.877 --> 00:09:28.837 line:15% 
really begun to see the full effects of this,

238
00:09:28.837 --> 00:09:31.917 line:15% 
because is my understanding, it's my understanding

239
00:09:31.917 --> 00:09:34.257 line:15% 
that where once when a house went

240
00:09:34.257 --> 00:09:35.597 line:15% 
into foreclosure, for example,

241
00:09:35.597 --> 00:09:37.917 line:15% 
it had to be on the books after 90 days.

242
00:09:37.917 --> 00:09:40.277 line:15% 
And as I understand it, that has been

243
00:09:40.277 --> 00:09:42.037 line:15% 
extended to a couple of years now.

244
00:09:42.037 --> 00:09:44.257 line:15% 
So we're not really seeing what's even on the books.

245
00:09:44.257 --> 00:09:47.477 line:15% 
Because the institutions would be almost

246
00:09:47.477 --> 00:09:49.319 line:15% 
in a position of failure over night.

247
00:09:49.319 --> 00:09:50.000 line:15% 
<v ->Exactly.</v>

248
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.760 line:15% 
That's why they're not foreclosing on these

249
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.480 line:15% 
homes that they should foreclose on,

250
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.780 line:15% 
because you notice they're reporting

251
00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:56.880 line:15% 
that they're profitable.

252
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.480 line:15% 
Well they would not be profitable if they had

253
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.390 line:15% 
to report all their real losses.

254
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.720 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>OK, so we're certainly being</v>

255
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.700 line:15% 
kept in the dark there.

256
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.300 line:15% 
However, the good news is that, and there are others,

257
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.650 line:15% 
oh gosh I've forgotten which of the legislators

258
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.580 line:15% 
on Capitol Hill, she's even in Michael Moore's movie,

259
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.600 line:15% 
famous for saying--

260
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.560 line:15% 
<v ->Is it Marcy Kaptur?</v>

261
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.100 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

262
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.762 line:15% 
Become a squatter in your own home.

263
00:10:18.762 --> 00:10:21.062 line:15% 
So, from a people point of view, if you've gotten

264
00:10:21.062 --> 00:10:23.482 line:15% 
yourself into a position where you've lost your job

265
00:10:23.482 --> 00:10:25.652 line:15% 
and you can't pay, you can certainly,

266
00:10:25.652 --> 00:10:27.462 line:15% 
probably comfortably stay in your home

267
00:10:27.462 --> 00:10:29.262 line:15% 
for a while before anyone's going to really

268
00:10:29.262 --> 00:10:30.782 line:15% 
come and take it away from you.

269
00:10:30.782 --> 00:10:31.482 line:15% 
Right?

270
00:10:31.482 --> 00:10:35.403 line:15% 
<v ->And justifiably because they really did,</v>

271
00:10:35.403 --> 00:10:36.903 line:15% 
there really was a scam going on.

272
00:10:36.903 --> 00:10:37.783 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

273
00:10:37.783 --> 00:10:39.704 line:15% 
<v ->So, these people, many of them have good</v>

274
00:10:39.704 --> 00:10:41.344 line:15% 
defenses to foreclosure.

275
00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:46.897 line:15% 
Usually, what do you call it, fraudulent...

276
00:10:47.805 --> 00:10:50.338 line:15% 
What am I thinking of, oh, predatory lending.

277
00:10:50.338 --> 00:10:51.678 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Oh, predatory lending.</v>

278
00:10:51.678 --> 00:10:53.108 line:15% 
<v ->Where the people that negotiate</v>

279
00:10:53.108 --> 00:10:55.848 line:15% 
with you tell you that it's one thing

280
00:10:55.848 --> 00:10:59.418 line:15% 
and then later you find out that it's something else.

281
00:10:59.419 --> 00:11:01.129 line:15% 
You know, they didn't tell you that it was

282
00:11:01.129 --> 00:11:04.861 line:15% 
gonna reset in six months or two years or whatever.

283
00:11:04.861 --> 00:11:05.822 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

284
00:11:05.822 --> 00:11:07.584 line:15% 
<v ->And of course they can say, "Well, you should have</v>

285
00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:08.626 line:15% 
"read the thing."

286
00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:11.006 line:15% 
But people just don't, I mean, you've seen those

287
00:11:11.006 --> 00:11:12.946 line:15% 
real estate contracts, they're so complicated.

288
00:11:12.946 --> 00:11:14.086 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>30-40 pages long.</v>

289
00:11:14.086 --> 00:11:15.966 line:15% 
<v ->And you trust the guy that, I mean you feel</v>

290
00:11:15.966 --> 00:11:18.467 line:15% 
like a fool if you say, "Oh, well wait, I wanna

291
00:11:18.467 --> 00:11:20.439 line:15% 
"read it, no I wanna read every word."

292
00:11:20.439 --> 00:11:22.060 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>I'll be back in two weeks, after I read it.</v>

293
00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.873 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah, so you just say: "OK, what does it say?"</v>

294
00:11:23.873 --> 00:11:25.469 line:15% 
And the guy says: "Well, it says this and this"

295
00:11:25.469 --> 00:11:26.449 line:15% 
and you say "OK".

296
00:11:26.449 --> 00:11:30.912 line:15% 
But so, now if you try to raise that defense,

297
00:11:30.912 --> 00:11:35.312 line:15% 
they say, these have all been sold off to investors,

298
00:11:35.312 --> 00:11:37.972 line:15% 
the investors are, there's a trustee in charge,

299
00:11:37.972 --> 00:11:40.785 line:15% 
while there is this thing called the mortgage electronic...

300
00:11:42.986 --> 00:11:45.436 line:15% 
Mortgage Electronic Registry Services

301
00:11:45.436 --> 00:11:47.218 line:15% 
which is a private company

302
00:11:47.218 --> 00:11:50.558 line:15% 
and 60 million homes,

303
00:11:50.558 --> 00:11:54.498 line:15% 
60 million mortgages are now held in the name of MERS,

304
00:11:54.498 --> 00:11:58.618 line:15% 
this MERS, Mortgage Electronic Registry Services.

305
00:11:58.618 --> 00:12:01.878 line:15% 
More and more cases are coming down saying that

306
00:12:01.878 --> 00:12:04.858 line:15% 
they do not have title, I mean they do not have standing

307
00:12:04.858 --> 00:12:08.038 line:15% 
to foreclose, they are just an agent and they don't have

308
00:12:08.038 --> 00:12:08.878 line:15% 
the proper standing.

309
00:12:08.878 --> 00:12:11.778 line:15% 
What they've done is separate the deed of trust

310
00:12:11.778 --> 00:12:14.173 line:15% 
from the mortgage which is the promise to pay

311
00:12:14.173 --> 00:12:15.176 line:15% 
or the right to--

312
00:12:15.176 --> 00:12:16.167 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

313
00:12:17.777 --> 00:12:19.768 line:15% 
<v ->They don't have standing to foreclose on your home,</v>

314
00:12:19.768 --> 00:12:21.908 line:15% 
they don't have a signed piece of paper that has

315
00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:23.828 line:15% 
your name on it and their name on it

316
00:12:23.828 --> 00:12:26.728 line:15% 
which is what you have to have under basic contract law

317
00:12:26.728 --> 00:12:29.108 line:15% 
to foreclose on real estate.

318
00:12:29.828 --> 00:12:32.691 line:15% 
There have been cases of people that have left their

319
00:12:32.691 --> 00:12:35.311 line:15% 
homes, their foreclosure has gone through

320
00:12:35.311 --> 00:12:36.951 line:15% 
and somebody else comes along

321
00:12:36.951 --> 00:12:39.033 line:15% 
and tries to foreclose and tries to collect

322
00:12:39.033 --> 00:12:41.853 line:15% 
a deficiency judgment 'cause you really don't know

323
00:12:41.853 --> 00:12:43.604 line:15% 
who owned that property.

324
00:12:43.604 --> 00:12:47.966 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Now, my understanding is you can order up</v>

325
00:12:47.966 --> 00:12:52.966 line:15% 
what is called mortgage forensics report which goes through

326
00:12:53.284 --> 00:12:58.284 line:15% 
and starts tracking, actually if that paper even exists.

327
00:12:59.095 --> 00:13:01.005 line:15% 
Like you say, often times it doesn't exist at all,

328
00:13:01.005 --> 00:13:03.585 line:15% 
it's been sold and resold and resold, those papers,

329
00:13:03.585 --> 00:13:06.225 line:15% 
those original documents that you would need,

330
00:13:06.225 --> 00:13:09.185 line:15% 
promise to pay along with deed of trust don't exist

331
00:13:09.185 --> 00:13:12.285 line:15% 
in which case what is the legal standing of an individual

332
00:13:12.285 --> 00:13:14.875 line:15% 
if that document cannot be produced?

333
00:13:15.265 --> 00:13:18.405 line:15% 
<v ->It depends, different courts are holding different ways,</v>

334
00:13:18.405 --> 00:13:22.025 line:15% 
but you have a very good shot at finding a favorable judge

335
00:13:22.025 --> 00:13:24.745 line:15% 
who will agree with you, that they have not complied

336
00:13:24.745 --> 00:13:26.445 line:15% 
with the law here.

337
00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:28.569 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Then what happens, do you just stay</v>

338
00:13:28.569 --> 00:13:30.459 line:15% 
in your home happily ever after?

339
00:13:30.459 --> 00:13:32.859 line:15% 
<v ->Well, that seems unlikely that they are going to let</v>

340
00:13:32.859 --> 00:13:34.859 line:15% 
60 million home-owners stay in their homes

341
00:13:34.859 --> 00:13:37.159 line:15% 
without paying, so you know they are going to have

342
00:13:37.159 --> 00:13:39.759 line:15% 
to make some adjustment, but that's Marcy Kaptur's point,

343
00:13:39.759 --> 00:13:42.499 line:15% 
is that we need some leverage here and we've got it.

344
00:13:42.499 --> 00:13:44.839 line:15% 
If you start staying in your homes, that's going to give us

345
00:13:44.839 --> 00:13:47.479 line:15% 
some leverage, when they see 60 million people

346
00:13:47.479 --> 00:13:51.759 line:15% 
who are saying "Prove it up" or at least make some

347
00:13:51.759 --> 00:13:54.679 line:15% 
concession to 'cause they are not working it out,

348
00:13:54.679 --> 00:13:57.119 line:15% 
the banks are not working it out with the home-owners

349
00:13:57.119 --> 00:13:59.529 line:15% 
like they are supposed to be.

350
00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.880 line:15% 
In fact, they can't work it out, and if they try

351
00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.880 line:15% 
to work it out, then they don't actually have

352
00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.560 line:15% 
title anymore, so it's the investors,

353
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.480 line:15% 
so they would have to make a deal with the investors,

354
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.300 line:15% 
well, their investors are going to say "No, the deal was

355
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:16.710 line:15% 
"you pay us X and we're not gonna agree to Y or whatever."

356
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.440 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>The message is, if you are dealing with</v>

357
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.640 line:15% 
the situation where your home is being foreclosed upon,

358
00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.740 line:15% 
maybe slow things down, don't panic,

359
00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.260 line:15% 
start looking into this paper trail

360
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.760 line:15% 
and see what your options are

361
00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.941 line:15% 
and I'm sure that there is going to be some kind

362
00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:33.201 line:15% 
of collective legislation or something that will

363
00:14:33.201 --> 00:14:34.311 line:15% 
come along.

364
00:14:34.311 --> 00:14:36.041 line:15% 
<v ->Right, that's what I'm particularly interested in,</v>

365
00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:38.516 line:15% 
is this, with the leverage we can get out of this.

366
00:14:38.516 --> 00:14:39.777
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

367
00:14:39.777 --> 00:14:41.047 line:15% 
That if everybody knows,

368
00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:42.927 line:15% 
see, most people don't know and so they see

369
00:14:42.927 --> 00:14:45.127 line:15% 
this foreclosure notice and they just pack their bags

370
00:14:45.127 --> 00:14:46.887 line:15% 
and move on and they think "Well, I don't have the money

371
00:14:46.887 --> 00:14:49.767 line:15% 
"and I cannot afford an attorney."

372
00:14:51.418 --> 00:14:52.888 line:15% 
And they are out of there, first of all,

373
00:14:52.888 --> 00:14:56.788 line:15% 
the property goes to ruin, it's not good for the neighbors,

374
00:14:56.788 --> 00:14:58.203 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Brings down the value of the neighborhood.</v>

375
00:14:58.203 --> 00:15:00.255 line:15% 
<v ->It's not good for anyone, yeah, for them to leave</v>

376
00:15:00.255 --> 00:15:04.341 line:15% 
and it's a lot harder to get your property back once you've,

377
00:15:04.341 --> 00:15:06.824 line:15% 
after the foreclosure is over than if you raised

378
00:15:06.824 --> 00:15:08.684 line:15% 
that defense at the time.

379
00:15:08.684 --> 00:15:10.924 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Comes back to the possession as nine tenths</v>

380
00:15:10.924 --> 00:15:13.574 line:15% 
of the law that still does hold some weight.

381
00:15:14.895 --> 00:15:17.765 line:15% 
Thank you for helping clarify this situation about these

382
00:15:17.765 --> 00:15:20.505 line:15% 
mortgages because I know even people,

383
00:15:20.505 --> 00:15:22.705 line:15% 
that some of our viewers that are watching this right now

384
00:15:22.705 --> 00:15:24.586 line:15% 
may be dealing with this kind of situation

385
00:15:24.586 --> 00:15:28.956 line:15% 
and that's helpful to calm it down and put a little bit

386
00:15:28.956 --> 00:15:31.018 line:15% 
of rational thinking over the top of it.

387
00:15:31.018 --> 00:15:32.688
<v Voiceover>So, meanwhile, yes, please--</v>

388
00:15:32.688 --> 00:15:36.176 line:15% 
<v ->There is also a potential lawsuit here from the investors</v>

389
00:15:36.176 --> 00:15:38.656 line:15% 
because they too, it's not just the home-owners

390
00:15:38.656 --> 00:15:41.256 line:15% 
who have been put in a compromised position,

391
00:15:41.256 --> 00:15:44.196 line:15% 
but look at the investors, they were sold bill of goods,

392
00:15:44.196 --> 00:15:47.696 line:15% 
so they can get together and there have been

393
00:15:47.696 --> 00:15:50.916 line:15% 
class action lawsuits, but the more they are aware

394
00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:53.376 line:15% 
of this possibility that it was actually a fraud

395
00:15:53.376 --> 00:15:56.176 line:15% 
on part of the banks, I think they should turn around

396
00:15:56.176 --> 00:15:59.846 line:15% 
and sue those Wall Street banks that setup those deals.

397
00:16:01.676 --> 00:16:04.277 line:15% 
This would be Goldman Sachs is largely responsible,

398
00:16:04.277 --> 00:16:06.737 line:15% 
and you know, these big, how are we going to bring down--

399
00:16:06.737 --> 00:16:07.915 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Like that's gonna happen,</v>

400
00:16:07.915 --> 00:16:10.543 line:15% 
they are still totally at the helm in the government.

401
00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:13.188 line:15% 
<v ->How are we going to bring them down,</v>

402
00:16:13.188 --> 00:16:15.348 line:15% 
we need some kind--

403
00:16:15.348 --> 00:16:16.506 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yeah, there needs to be some kind</v>

404
00:16:16.506 --> 00:16:19.686 line:15% 
of legislation, it is interesting because it seems

405
00:16:19.686 --> 00:16:22.786 line:15% 
like Goldman Sachs is a revolving door towards

406
00:16:22.786 --> 00:16:27.090 line:15% 
a governmental position, i.e. Geithner and others,

407
00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:28.286 line:15% 
Falsom, there you go.

408
00:16:28.286 --> 00:16:33.069 line:15% 
OK, let's move back into the rest of the...

409
00:16:35.139 --> 00:16:37.879 line:15% 
The rest of the issues of the banking industry right now,

410
00:16:37.879 --> 00:16:41.239 line:15% 
I know you've been working pretty fast and furiously

411
00:16:41.239 --> 00:16:44.139 line:15% 
on an alternative to what's going on right now,

412
00:16:44.139 --> 00:16:46.819 line:15% 
but let's talk about the problem of what is going on

413
00:16:46.819 --> 00:16:50.019 line:15% 
and what kinds of banks are at risk right now

414
00:16:50.019 --> 00:16:53.459 line:15% 
and which kinds of banks are a little bit better bet

415
00:16:53.459 --> 00:16:55.279 line:15% 
if you are going to be banking with someone,

416
00:16:55.279 --> 00:16:57.969 line:15% 
some entity that exists right now.

417
00:17:01.719 --> 00:17:06.619 line:15% 
<v ->It's good if you can find a secured community bank,</v>

418
00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:09.019 line:15% 
that would be good, but some communities,

419
00:17:09.019 --> 00:17:12.949 line:15% 
California lost 200 banks this year

420
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:14.699 line:15% 
and the problem is they don't tell you before

421
00:17:14.699 --> 00:17:15.919 line:15% 
they close their doors.

422
00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:17.439 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>No, no, it's very interesting.</v>

423
00:17:17.439 --> 00:17:18.500 line:15% 
<v ->You want to go carefully into it,</v>

424
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.080 line:15% 
but ideally, at least in theory, if your local credit unions

425
00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.840 line:15% 
and your local community banks are less likely

426
00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.200 line:15% 
to be involved in all this Wall Street stuff,

427
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.280 line:15% 
but of course, in truth, probably nobody is more secure

428
00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:36.000 line:15% 
than J.P Morgan or Chase because they own the government.

429
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.225 line:15% 
In truth, they are probably as secure as you can get,

430
00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:41.675 line:15% 
but I wouldn't want to recommend that.

431
00:17:41.675 --> 00:17:45.268 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>I know what you mean, I heard the same thing,</v>

432
00:17:45.268 --> 00:17:46.765 line:15% 
but thank you for clarifying that.

433
00:17:48.288 --> 00:17:50.519 line:15% 
<v ->I certainly favor community banks,</v>

434
00:17:50.519 --> 00:17:52.569 line:15% 
but you do want to look into it to make sure,

435
00:17:52.569 --> 00:17:55.784 line:15% 
if you can find one of those lists of banks

436
00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:58.044 line:15% 
in jeopardy, make sure your bank is not on it

437
00:17:58.044 --> 00:17:59.824 line:15% 
before you put a lot of money into it

438
00:17:59.824 --> 00:18:01.884 line:15% 
and diversify, it's always good to have it in several

439
00:18:01.884 --> 00:18:03.284 line:15% 
different banks.

440
00:18:03.284 --> 00:18:05.364 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about some of the banks that really</v>

441
00:18:05.364 --> 00:18:10.234 line:15% 
are in trouble right now, some of the larger institutions

442
00:18:10.234 --> 00:18:11.935 line:15% 
because most of us probably have our money

443
00:18:11.935 --> 00:18:13.855 line:15% 
with the larger institutions.

444
00:18:15.145 --> 00:18:18.435 line:15% 
<v ->I don't actually know which ones,</v>

445
00:18:18.435 --> 00:18:21.187 line:15% 
I haven't looked into that, I know my own small community

446
00:18:21.187 --> 00:18:25.107 line:15% 
bank which I love, I read this article and it said

447
00:18:25.107 --> 00:18:28.727 line:15% 
"The FDIC is bankrupt and therefore you may not be able

448
00:18:28.727 --> 00:18:32.230 line:15% 
"to count on them covering your 250,000 dollar..."

449
00:18:34.967 --> 00:18:37.486 line:15% 
"Up to 250,000 dollars in deposits."

450
00:18:37.486 --> 00:18:39.356 line:15% 
You better look and make sure that your bank

451
00:18:39.356 --> 00:18:41.046 line:15% 
isn't on this list.

452
00:18:41.046 --> 00:18:44.396 line:15% 
They had this informal list attached to this article,

453
00:18:44.396 --> 00:18:47.686 line:15% 
so I looked and sure enough there was my bank.

454
00:18:48.016 --> 00:18:49.576 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yeah, that's a disappointment.</v>

455
00:18:51.456 --> 00:18:53.217 line:15% 
<v ->But I keep going in there and I say "How are things?"</v>

456
00:18:53.217 --> 00:18:55.427 line:15% 
And they say "Oh, fine, we're doing fine."

457
00:18:55.707 --> 00:18:57.604 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Haven't been laid off yet.</v>

458
00:18:57.604 --> 00:18:59.716 line:15% 
It's a very interesting thing that happens,

459
00:18:59.716 --> 00:19:03.077 line:15% 
I was listening to NPR one day on a drive somewhere

460
00:19:03.077 --> 00:19:07.037 line:15% 
and they were interviewing a person that deals with

461
00:19:07.037 --> 00:19:11.307 line:15% 
takeovers of closings of banks and takeovers of banks.

462
00:19:11.747 --> 00:19:16.747 line:15% 
It's something that's a very radical, almost violent

463
00:19:17.237 --> 00:19:20.997 line:15% 
operation, that they come in and these banks are

464
00:19:20.997 --> 00:19:25.197 line:15% 
sequestered usually on a Friday afternoon,

465
00:19:25.197 --> 00:19:27.917 line:15% 
everybody is out, new team in,

466
00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:30.717 line:15% 
maybe new signage is already up by Monday,

467
00:19:30.717 --> 00:19:33.157 line:15% 
it happens very, very quickly, so there is no

468
00:19:33.157 --> 00:19:36.710 line:15% 
advance warning if this is going to happen

469
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:38.848 line:15% 
to even the people in the bank.

470
00:19:39.048 --> 00:19:40.788 line:15% 
Often the managers don't even know

471
00:19:40.788 --> 00:19:42.178 line:15% 
that this is going to happen,

472
00:19:42.178 --> 00:19:45.778 line:15% 
so it's not as though they can try to give you a little wink

473
00:19:45.778 --> 00:19:49.148 line:15% 
and "I wouldn't put that check in here today."

474
00:19:49.408 --> 00:19:52.228 line:15% 
They can't do that because they don't know.

475
00:19:53.178 --> 00:19:55.713 line:15% 
<v ->In most cases you will be covered by FDIC,</v>

476
00:19:55.713 --> 00:19:59.353 line:15% 
in the event that they just switched over like you say,

477
00:19:59.353 --> 00:20:01.213 line:15% 
but there is something like Northern Rock,

478
00:20:01.213 --> 00:20:04.245 line:15% 
there are cases where people have just lost their money.

479
00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:05.475 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yeah, yeah.</v>

480
00:20:05.475 --> 00:20:09.295 line:15% 
So, you're looking at this from a solution's point of view,

481
00:20:09.295 --> 00:20:12.540 line:15% 
the way the system exists right now is not working

482
00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.540 line:15% 
in the way that it's being implemented, but you are saying

483
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.880 line:15% 
there are elements of the banking system and even

484
00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.180 line:15% 
fractionalized reserve banking that can work if

485
00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.940 line:15% 
run through a little different lens.

486
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.000 line:15% 
Let's talk about some of your vision now

487
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.550 line:15% 
and focus on that.

488
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.680 line:15% 
<v ->Fractional reserve banking, at first you look at it</v>

489
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.960 line:15% 
and you go "That's a fraud."

490
00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.200 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>It does seem like it.</v>

491
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.881 line:15% 
<v ->We're being taken advantage of here, that's not fair</v>

492
00:20:34.881 --> 00:20:37.361 line:15% 
and then the more you look at it, you go,

493
00:20:37.361 --> 00:20:39.021 line:15% 
"Hey, we could do that."

494
00:20:39.021 --> 00:20:42.921 line:15% 
We, the people, if it were a public bank,

495
00:20:42.921 --> 00:20:44.601 line:15% 
it would be perfectly legitimate,

496
00:20:44.601 --> 00:20:45.701 line:15% 
it would be perfectly sound,

497
00:20:45.701 --> 00:20:49.821 line:15% 
mathematically sustainable because

498
00:20:49.821 --> 00:20:52.881 line:15% 
first of all, let's say if it's particularly on a federal

499
00:20:52.881 --> 00:20:56.942 line:15% 
level, all our money today consists of nothing but

500
00:20:56.942 --> 00:20:59.382 line:15% 
the full faith in credit of the United States.

501
00:20:59.382 --> 00:21:02.382 line:15% 
If you are the United States, you can issue credit

502
00:21:02.382 --> 00:21:07.162 line:15% 
without any sort of reserves or capital because

503
00:21:07.162 --> 00:21:09.842 line:15% 
what's the point of having reserves or credit

504
00:21:09.842 --> 00:21:10.962 line:15% 
of your own credit.

505
00:21:10.962 --> 00:21:15.182 line:15% 
You're just acknowledging that the person is a good

506
00:21:15.182 --> 00:21:18.753 line:15% 
credit risk and you're giving a loan.

507
00:21:20.123 --> 00:21:23.334 line:15% 
You are monetizing the person's own promise to repay.

508
00:21:23.879 --> 00:21:26.919 line:15% 
So, if you were a community, publicly owned bank,

509
00:21:26.919 --> 00:21:30.139 line:15% 
your function would be to make sure that this person

510
00:21:30.139 --> 00:21:32.079 line:15% 
was actually credit-worthy and that they were going

511
00:21:32.079 --> 00:21:34.319 line:15% 
to pay it back and if they were, you would give them

512
00:21:34.319 --> 00:21:36.999 line:15% 
the credit, it wouldn't matter what you had on the way

513
00:21:36.999 --> 00:21:38.039 line:15% 
of reserves, etc.

514
00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:40.359 line:15% 
You don't have to find a pot of gold over here

515
00:21:40.359 --> 00:21:43.759 line:15% 
in order for the community to trust the person

516
00:21:43.759 --> 00:21:46.039 line:15% 
with their goods and services long enough

517
00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:48.859 line:15% 
for the person to build whatever it is he wants to build

518
00:21:48.859 --> 00:21:53.029 line:15% 
or however he proposes to pay this project back.

519
00:21:53.779 --> 00:21:57.179 line:15% 
If you have publicly owned banks, but even assuming

520
00:21:57.179 --> 00:21:59.179 line:15% 
you want to comply with the capital primer,

521
00:21:59.179 --> 00:22:02.239 line:15% 
which is a good idea, so people don't freak out.

522
00:22:02.239 --> 00:22:05.219 line:15% 
California, this is my favorite idea, would be for

523
00:22:05.219 --> 00:22:08.109 line:15% 
California to form its own bank.

524
00:22:08.469 --> 00:22:10.199 line:15% 
There is one state in the country that already

525
00:22:10.199 --> 00:22:12.859 line:15% 
has its own bank, the Bank of North Dakota,

526
00:22:12.859 --> 00:22:15.159 line:15% 
it is one of only two states that are able to meet

527
00:22:15.159 --> 00:22:17.819 line:15% 
their budgets or will be by next year.

528
00:22:17.819 --> 00:22:20.459 line:15% 
The other is Montana and the chart where I saw that,

529
00:22:20.459 --> 00:22:23.019 line:15% 
they listed Montana as an oil state, but they said

530
00:22:23.019 --> 00:22:25.779 line:15% 
nothing about North Dakota, what's in North Dakota?

531
00:22:25.779 --> 00:22:28.239 line:15% 
Nothing, so why are they doing so well?

532
00:22:28.239 --> 00:22:29.859 line:15% 
Because they have their own credit machine,

533
00:22:29.859 --> 00:22:32.279 line:15% 
they have escape to the credit crisis that everybody

534
00:22:32.279 --> 00:22:33.799 line:15% 
else is in.

535
00:22:33.799 --> 00:22:35.839 line:15% 
And in North Dakota, the way they do it,

536
00:22:35.839 --> 00:22:36.879 line:15% 
I just read this recently...

537
00:22:39.329 --> 00:22:42.057 line:15% 
It's the State of North Dakota doing business

538
00:22:42.057 --> 00:22:43.917 line:15% 
as the Bank of North Dakota,

539
00:22:43.917 --> 00:22:45.357 line:15% 
in other words, it's a DBA,

540
00:22:45.357 --> 00:22:48.957 line:15% 
that means that all of the assets of the state

541
00:22:48.957 --> 00:22:51.327 line:15% 
are the assets of the bank.

542
00:22:51.417 --> 00:22:53.933 line:15% 
When the regulator comes around or when you are trying

543
00:22:53.933 --> 00:22:56.259 line:15% 
to get your charter and you say...

544
00:22:57.889 --> 00:23:01.369 line:15% 
"California has 200 billion dollars worth

545
00:23:01.369 --> 00:23:03.919 line:15% 
"of just real estate owned by the state."

546
00:23:04.139 --> 00:23:07.049 line:15% 
I don't mean in that state, but owned by the state,

547
00:23:07.049 --> 00:23:11.029 line:15% 
actual property, plus there is like 62 billion

548
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:15.299 line:15% 
invested in various, money invested.

549
00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:18.309 line:15% 
So, we have funds, and we have a lot of assets

550
00:23:18.309 --> 00:23:21.199 line:15% 
plus your revenues which you get every year.

551
00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:25.477 line:15% 
If you actually did the fractional reserve thing

552
00:23:25.477 --> 00:23:28.307 line:15% 
as a public bank, just say that 200 billion

553
00:23:28.307 --> 00:23:32.617 line:15% 
of real estate could be leveraged into 2 trillion in loans.

554
00:23:32.797 --> 00:23:35.827 line:15% 
Many people, different bankers will challenge me on that,

555
00:23:35.827 --> 00:23:37.773 line:15% 
and say: "That's not the way it's done."

556
00:23:37.773 --> 00:23:40.043 line:15% 
But that is the way it's done, if you look carefully,

557
00:23:40.043 --> 00:23:45.043 line:15% 
that's all they pay attention to, when the regulator comes

558
00:23:45.263 --> 00:23:50.263 line:15% 
around, or when they have to submit these reports.

559
00:23:50.583 --> 00:23:52.817 line:15% 
I think it's every three months they have to submit

560
00:23:52.817 --> 00:23:54.155 line:15% 
a report to the regulator showing

561
00:23:54.155 --> 00:23:57.795 line:15% 
that they met their capital requirement, that's when they

562
00:23:57.795 --> 00:24:01.755 line:15% 
look and they say: "OK, you have to have eight dollars

563
00:24:01.755 --> 00:24:04.055 line:15% 
"of capital for a 100 dollars in loans."

564
00:24:04.055 --> 00:24:05.489 line:15% 
And they say: "We've done that."

565
00:24:05.489 --> 00:24:07.789 line:15% 
Or if they haven't done it, they sell off some loans

566
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:10.079 line:15% 
to some other bank and maybe buy them back later.

567
00:24:10.429 --> 00:24:13.469 line:15% 
Or they borrow some reserves from the money

568
00:24:13.469 --> 00:24:18.433 line:15% 
markets or from the Fed, but they just shift it around.

569
00:24:19.441 --> 00:24:23.351 line:15% 
Nobody checks, when a borrower walks into a bank,

570
00:24:23.351 --> 00:24:25.611 line:15% 
I asked two bankers this and they confirmed,

571
00:24:25.611 --> 00:24:28.461 line:15% 
if you're a loan officer and a borrower walks into a bank

572
00:24:28.461 --> 00:24:29.891 line:15% 
and they want a certain amount of loan,

573
00:24:29.891 --> 00:24:31.951 line:15% 
do you check to see what you have in deposit here

574
00:24:31.951 --> 00:24:34.411 line:15% 
to make sure that you are only lending 90 percent of that?

575
00:24:34.411 --> 00:24:35.531 line:15% 
He said "No".

576
00:24:37.179 --> 00:24:40.439 line:15% 
Somebody gives you a loan limit, it's a huge loan limit,

577
00:24:40.439 --> 00:24:43.819 line:15% 
a big number and you can't make loans beyond that,

578
00:24:43.819 --> 00:24:47.359 line:15% 
and I said "What if 10 loan officers make the same,

579
00:24:47.359 --> 00:24:49.639 line:15% 
"hit the max at the same time?"

580
00:24:49.639 --> 00:24:52.329 line:15% 
That's all right, no problem, so nobody is really.

581
00:24:52.329 --> 00:24:54.440 line:15% 
Everybody assumes that somebody else

582
00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.320 line:15% 
is watching, but I haven't been able to find

583
00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.960 line:15% 
that one person that checks, except every three months

584
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.520 line:15% 
when they have to report what they've got,

585
00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.560 line:15% 
and then they check and if they don't have it,

586
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.092 line:15% 
they fiddle with the books until they do have it.

587
00:25:09.472 --> 00:25:12.192 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>This is a completely faith-based system.</v>

588
00:25:12.432 --> 00:25:15.362 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah, so if we, the public, if we could do the same thing</v>

589
00:25:15.362 --> 00:25:18.162 line:15% 
and we could create credit for all those things

590
00:25:18.162 --> 00:25:21.422 line:15% 
we need, we could build, we could fund education,

591
00:25:21.422 --> 00:25:25.922 line:15% 
we could fund healthcare and we could build

592
00:25:25.922 --> 00:25:29.132 line:15% 
alternative energy projects, transportation.

593
00:25:29.132 --> 00:25:32.046 line:15% 
Those are the ideals, the ones that actually pay money back.

594
00:25:32.776 --> 00:25:35.536 line:15% 
Let's say you were building a mag-train,

595
00:25:35.536 --> 00:25:37.936 line:15% 
what are they called, a mag-train, those really fast trains.

596
00:25:37.936 --> 00:25:40.300 line:15% 
They go from L.A. to San Francisco, let's say that was

597
00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:41.500 line:15% 
your project.

598
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:42.760 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>A type of bullet train.</v>

599
00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:43.278 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah.</v>

600
00:25:43.278 --> 00:25:45.909 line:15% 
You would set that, you would monetize it,

601
00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:47.959 line:15% 
in other words, you'd say, this train is going to cost,

602
00:25:47.959 --> 00:25:50.919 line:15% 
I have no idea what a train costs, buy you'd write that

603
00:25:50.919 --> 00:25:54.879 line:15% 
sum up on one side of your books and then as if it were

604
00:25:54.879 --> 00:25:57.619 line:15% 
a completed project, you're going to monetize the thing.

605
00:25:57.619 --> 00:25:59.939 line:15% 
Then you pay your workers and materials out of that

606
00:25:59.939 --> 00:26:04.139 line:15% 
and you pay the loan off out of the profits

607
00:26:04.139 --> 00:26:05.679 line:15% 
made from the thing.

608
00:26:05.679 --> 00:26:07.819 line:15% 
Since you're your own back, you're going to get

609
00:26:07.819 --> 00:26:09.552 line:15% 
the interest back.

610
00:26:09.552 --> 00:26:13.473 line:15% 
And interest, on average

611
00:26:13.473 --> 00:26:14.934 line:15% 
for all government projects

612
00:26:14.934 --> 00:26:18.314 line:15% 
adds up to 50 percent of the cost of the project,

613
00:26:18.314 --> 00:26:20.914 line:15% 
so you would cut the cost of your project in half

614
00:26:20.914 --> 00:26:23.244 line:15% 
right there just by saving the interest.

615
00:26:23.604 --> 00:26:25.794 line:15% 
Just to make everything look fair, if other banks

616
00:26:25.794 --> 00:26:29.114 line:15% 
will say: "Not fair", you can say "We're charging

617
00:26:29.114 --> 00:26:30.745 line:15% 
"five percent interest."

618
00:26:30.745 --> 00:26:32.485 line:15% 
Of course we get to keep the interest.

619
00:26:32.485 --> 00:26:34.085 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>We get to keep it, right.</v>

620
00:26:34.345 --> 00:26:37.255 line:15% 
It seems very sane, it seems like a very sane idea

621
00:26:37.255 --> 00:26:39.895 line:15% 
and if you look to North Dakota, it has proved

622
00:26:39.895 --> 00:26:42.555 line:15% 
to be a very sustainable model for that state.

623
00:26:42.555 --> 00:26:43.555 line:15% 
<v ->90 years.</v>

624
00:26:43.555 --> 00:26:46.235 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>90 years, but then you look at the fact</v>

625
00:26:46.235 --> 00:26:50.735 line:15% 
that California is the eight largest economy in the world

626
00:26:50.735 --> 00:26:53.735 line:15% 
and you think "How do we even get our minds around

627
00:26:53.735 --> 00:26:56.405 line:15% 
"doing this on such a large scale?"

628
00:26:56.535 --> 00:26:59.895 line:15% 
How does one get their mind around that,

629
00:26:59.895 --> 00:27:02.985 line:15% 
how does it begin, how does that play out?

630
00:27:03.675 --> 00:27:07.335 line:15% 
<v ->It would be wonderful if California took the lead</v>

631
00:27:07.335 --> 00:27:10.255 line:15% 
because we're California, we take the lead

632
00:27:10.255 --> 00:27:13.115 line:15% 
in everything, we're creative thinkers,

633
00:27:13.115 --> 00:27:15.375 line:15% 
but it seems more likely that maybe,

634
00:27:15.375 --> 00:27:17.515 line:15% 
for instance, Miami-Dade County is looking at

635
00:27:17.515 --> 00:27:20.075 line:15% 
forming their own bank.

636
00:27:20.075 --> 00:27:23.355 line:15% 
That's just a county, although it's population is actually

637
00:27:23.355 --> 00:27:25.775 line:15% 
three times the population of North Dakota,

638
00:27:25.775 --> 00:27:29.655 line:15% 
so if they did it, it would be a very dramatic model

639
00:27:29.655 --> 00:27:31.945 line:15% 
if it worked, but somebody like that.

640
00:27:32.375 --> 00:27:35.955 line:15% 
It would just be easier to get a consensus among your

641
00:27:35.955 --> 00:27:37.935 line:15% 
legislators you can see we're going to have

642
00:27:37.935 --> 00:27:39.395 line:15% 
an uphill battle.

643
00:27:39.395 --> 00:27:41.215 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Because of the lobbying, let's</v>

644
00:27:41.215 --> 00:27:43.405 line:15% 
talk about lobbying on Capitol Hill.

645
00:27:43.835 --> 00:27:46.435 line:15% 
<v ->Capitol Hill I think is the worst,</v>

646
00:27:46.435 --> 00:27:50.335 line:15% 
that's one reason I'm more in favor of going

647
00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:54.965 line:15% 
for a state or a county than into Congress

648
00:27:54.965 --> 00:27:57.995 line:15% 
because Congress is bought and paid for by the banks,

649
00:27:57.995 --> 00:28:00.245 line:15% 
but it's because they have the power to create money.

650
00:28:00.715 --> 00:28:02.655 line:15% 
If we want to get Congress back, we've got to get

651
00:28:02.655 --> 00:28:04.225 line:15% 
that power back.

652
00:28:05.295 --> 00:28:08.795 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>This was foreseen from the beginning,</v>

653
00:28:08.795 --> 00:28:10.835 line:15% 
certainly from the beginning of this country.

654
00:28:10.835 --> 00:28:12.695 line:15% 
If you care to share a little bit of history

655
00:28:12.695 --> 00:28:16.915 line:15% 
about what was going to become Alexander Hamilton,

656
00:28:16.915 --> 00:28:19.535 line:15% 
how we ended up in this position, maybe

657
00:28:19.535 --> 00:28:22.495 line:15% 
famous comments from Thomas Jefferson,

658
00:28:22.495 --> 00:28:25.435 line:15% 
just tell us what happened in that period of time

659
00:28:25.435 --> 00:28:28.835 line:15% 
that would lead us to at least have an inkling

660
00:28:28.835 --> 00:28:31.685 line:15% 
that something like this crisis would happen down the road.

661
00:28:33.075 --> 00:28:35.595 line:15% 
<v ->For a hundred years before the Revolution,</v>

662
00:28:35.595 --> 00:28:40.196 line:15% 
we had our own system

663
00:28:40.196 --> 00:28:42.376 line:15% 
that was competing with the bank notes

664
00:28:42.376 --> 00:28:44.036 line:15% 
system of the bank of England

665
00:28:44.036 --> 00:28:46.606 line:15% 
which setup this private central bank system.

666
00:28:47.636 --> 00:28:51.106 line:15% 
Where the provinces issued money publicly.

667
00:28:51.436 --> 00:28:55.136 line:15% 
It's publicly issued money versus privately issued money

668
00:28:55.136 --> 00:28:58.286 line:15% 
and it worked really well for that hundred years.

669
00:28:59.276 --> 00:29:01.336 line:15% 
Some of them worked better than others,

670
00:29:01.336 --> 00:29:03.416 line:15% 
but it worked really well in Pennsylvania which is the model

671
00:29:03.416 --> 00:29:04.416 line:15% 
we should go back to.

672
00:29:04.416 --> 00:29:06.796 line:15% 
That was Benjamin Franklin's colony, he is called the father

673
00:29:06.796 --> 00:29:11.250 line:15% 
of paper money, he raved about how this was why

674
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.420 line:15% 
there was so much abundance in the colonies

675
00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:16.080 line:15% 
when in England they were already struggling with these

676
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.230 line:15% 
industrial revolution-type conditions.

677
00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.760 line:15% 
In Pennsylvania what they did, in some of the colonies

678
00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.860 line:15% 
they just printed money, printed money and printed money

679
00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.220 line:15% 
and that was inflationary so that wasn't such a great idea,

680
00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.250 line:15% 
but in Pennsylvania, the province owned the bank.

681
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.620 line:15% 
Before they setup this bank, nobody wanted to go

682
00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:38.320 line:15% 
to Pennsylvania because there was no money there

683
00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.300 line:15% 
and they had to borrow from the British bankers

684
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.040 line:15% 
at eight percent interest, borrow gold

685
00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.540 line:15% 
and even then, there weren't that many,

686
00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:47.860 line:15% 
even at eight percent it was hard to do,

687
00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.510 line:15% 
to get money.

688
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.800 line:15% 
So, Benjamin Franklin didn't actually originate the system,

689
00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:57.090 line:15% 
it was the province of Pennsylvania, but they had

690
00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:59.185 line:15% 
setup a bank so they would lend money

691
00:29:59.185 --> 00:30:00.908 line:15% 
to the farmers and then the money

692
00:30:00.908 --> 00:30:02.548 line:15% 
would come to the province,

693
00:30:02.548 --> 00:30:05.088 line:15% 
so they would lend the same money over and over again

694
00:30:05.088 --> 00:30:07.388 line:15% 
and then to cover the interest so you didn't have this

695
00:30:07.388 --> 00:30:09.568 line:15% 
sort of parasitic pyramid scheme like we have

696
00:30:09.568 --> 00:30:12.908 line:15% 
with private interest, they issued a little extra

697
00:30:12.908 --> 00:30:15.388 line:15% 
and spent it on government needs

698
00:30:15.388 --> 00:30:18.348 line:15% 
so then you would have enough money out there

699
00:30:18.348 --> 00:30:19.948 line:15% 
to pay principle and interest.

700
00:30:19.948 --> 00:30:22.768 line:15% 
So, then you never had to increase the money supply.

701
00:30:22.768 --> 00:30:26.588 line:15% 
During the time they had that system, they paid no taxes,

702
00:30:26.588 --> 00:30:28.948 line:15% 
they had no government debt and the prices

703
00:30:28.948 --> 00:30:31.098 line:15% 
did not inflate, it was a perfect system.

704
00:30:31.768 --> 00:30:34.148 line:15% 
But then, and that according to Benjamin Franklin,

705
00:30:34.148 --> 00:30:36.908 line:15% 
that was a major reason we fought the revolution

706
00:30:36.908 --> 00:30:40.428 line:15% 
was that King George took away the power of the colonists

707
00:30:40.428 --> 00:30:45.269 line:15% 
to print new issues of money, that's what the order was

708
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:48.419 line:15% 
and they did it for a reason.

709
00:30:49.169 --> 00:30:52.389 line:15% 
Merchants were complaining because they were dealing with

710
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:55.329 line:15% 
13 different currencies, they didn't know

711
00:30:55.329 --> 00:30:57.529 line:15% 
what the value of these different things were

712
00:30:57.529 --> 00:31:00.089 line:15% 
and some of them weren't sustainably done,

713
00:31:00.089 --> 00:31:01.469 line:15% 
they were deflating.

714
00:31:01.469 --> 00:31:02.549 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Right, right.</v>

715
00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:04.769 line:15% 
<v ->There was some logic to it, but that meant</v>

716
00:31:04.769 --> 00:31:07.269 line:15% 
that we had to borrow gold from the British bankers

717
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:09.229 line:15% 
in order to pay our taxes, so that's what the

718
00:31:09.229 --> 00:31:12.589 line:15% 
taxation without representation thing was all about,

719
00:31:12.589 --> 00:31:14.209 line:15% 
not just that we were being taxed,

720
00:31:14.209 --> 00:31:17.429 line:15% 
but we were being taxed in a currency we were not allowed

721
00:31:17.429 --> 00:31:19.849 line:15% 
to create and we had no control over.

722
00:31:19.849 --> 00:31:23.209 line:15% 
The farmers were losing their farms, there is general

723
00:31:23.209 --> 00:31:27.009 line:15% 
rebellion and they just went back to their old system

724
00:31:27.009 --> 00:31:29.189 line:15% 
which was considered an act of rebellion and we had

725
00:31:29.189 --> 00:31:33.189 line:15% 
the revolution which we won issuing paper receipts

726
00:31:33.189 --> 00:31:35.761 line:15% 
which is a remarkable thing, it never had been done before,

727
00:31:35.761 --> 00:31:39.031 line:15% 
to win a war just with these paper receipts without

728
00:31:39.031 --> 00:31:41.171 line:15% 
actually having what was called real money then,

729
00:31:41.171 --> 00:31:43.202 line:15% 
like gold and silver.

730
00:31:43.202 --> 00:31:46.452 line:15% 
But we lost the ability to create our own money,

731
00:31:46.452 --> 00:31:50.174 line:15% 
because, that's kind of a long story,

732
00:31:50.174 --> 00:31:54.894 line:15% 
the British were heavily counterfeiting this currency

733
00:31:54.894 --> 00:31:56.574 line:15% 
as a matter of war policy.

734
00:31:56.574 --> 00:31:58.734 line:15% 
Actually, Napoleon did the same thing--

735
00:31:58.734 --> 00:32:01.054 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Flooding our markets with it.</v>

736
00:32:01.054 --> 00:32:04.314 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah, they were the ones that were printing too much.</v>

737
00:32:04.314 --> 00:32:06.584 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Subterfuge going on there, yes.</v>

738
00:32:07.334 --> 00:32:09.794 line:15% 
<v ->So that devalued the currency, plus it had to compete</v>

739
00:32:09.794 --> 00:32:12.254 line:15% 
with the other currencies which were more stable,

740
00:32:12.254 --> 00:32:15.934 line:15% 
so by the end of the war it had completely collapsed

741
00:32:15.934 --> 00:32:19.254 line:15% 
and the founding fathers were so suspicious of it

742
00:32:19.254 --> 00:32:21.914 line:15% 
that they couldn't agree whether to put it in

743
00:32:21.914 --> 00:32:22.974 line:15% 
the constitution or not.

744
00:32:22.974 --> 00:32:24.534 line:15% 
I guess there were actually riots outside

745
00:32:24.534 --> 00:32:27.154 line:15% 
the constitutional convention, so they had to do something

746
00:32:27.154 --> 00:32:29.564 line:15% 
fast, the soldiers wanted their money, etc.

747
00:32:29.794 --> 00:32:33.574 line:15% 
So, they said, they were kind of vague

748
00:32:33.574 --> 00:32:35.394 line:15% 
about who had the power to create money,

749
00:32:35.394 --> 00:32:37.465 line:15% 
they said Congress will have the power to coin money,

750
00:32:37.465 --> 00:32:39.354 line:15% 
that's all it says in the constitution.

751
00:32:39.744 --> 00:32:42.564 line:15% 
Meanwhile, they got out of there

752
00:32:42.564 --> 00:32:46.624 line:15% 
and the first treasure secretary, Alexander Hamilton

753
00:32:46.624 --> 00:32:49.364 line:15% 
was stuck with all these war debts and no money

754
00:32:49.364 --> 00:32:52.304 line:15% 
to pay them with so he resorted to the rules

755
00:32:52.304 --> 00:32:56.044 line:15% 
used in England, which was to setup the first U.S. bank

756
00:32:56.044 --> 00:32:58.484 line:15% 
which was actually privately owned.

757
00:32:59.616 --> 00:33:01.339 line:15% 
They put the government's gold into it,

758
00:33:01.339 --> 00:33:05.259 line:15% 
what gold they had and then they could create 10 times

759
00:33:05.259 --> 00:33:08.200 line:15% 
that sum in bank notes, lend them to the government

760
00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.400 line:15% 
and so now there was plenty of money to pay off their debts,

761
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.260 line:15% 
it was a ruse, but it worked and everybody trusted

762
00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:15.640 line:15% 
these bank notes more than they would've trusted

763
00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.360 line:15% 
their government-issued money because

764
00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.250 line:15% 
it was supposedly backed by gold.

765
00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:21.140 line:15% 
But the problem was it put us in debt

766
00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.752 line:15% 
to these private bankers pretending to have money,

767
00:33:23.752 --> 00:33:26.162 line:15% 
Benjamin Franklin called them "Bold and bankrupt

768
00:33:26.162 --> 00:33:28.552 line:15% 
"adventurers just pretending to have money."

769
00:33:28.862 --> 00:33:31.782 line:15% 
At first, he didn't get it either and at first

770
00:33:31.782 --> 00:33:34.402 line:15% 
he blamed the paper money, and then later,

771
00:33:34.402 --> 00:33:37.012 line:15% 
he realized that they had been taken.

772
00:33:39.282 --> 00:33:43.082 line:15% 
I think it was 1813, he said in a letter

773
00:33:43.082 --> 00:33:47.962 line:15% 
that he thought that bankers were more dangerous

774
00:33:47.962 --> 00:33:52.603 line:15% 
than standing armies and that the issuing power

775
00:33:52.603 --> 00:33:55.043 line:15% 
should be returned to the people, to whom it belonged,

776
00:33:55.043 --> 00:33:57.723 line:15% 
in other words, he thought the government should be

777
00:33:57.723 --> 00:33:59.753 line:15% 
issuing the money, but that's not what happened.

778
00:34:00.743 --> 00:34:03.403 line:15% 
The bankers got in control and we had

779
00:34:03.403 --> 00:34:07.573 line:15% 
our Federal Reserve System setup formally in 1913,

780
00:34:07.573 --> 00:34:11.803 line:15% 
giving a private central bank, privately owned by

781
00:34:11.803 --> 00:34:15.643 line:15% 
many banks the power to issue money and lend it

782
00:34:15.643 --> 00:34:18.593 line:15% 
to our government and lend it to the other banks.

783
00:34:20.743 --> 00:34:22.363 line:15% 
That's where we are today.

784
00:34:22.363 --> 00:34:25.193 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Federal Reserve, do we need it?</v>

785
00:34:25.663 --> 00:34:27.923 line:15% 
<v ->It's actually a useful thing to have a central bank,</v>

786
00:34:27.923 --> 00:34:31.443 line:15% 
I know there is two possibilities, we certainly

787
00:34:31.443 --> 00:34:33.983 line:15% 
don't need it as a private central bank,

788
00:34:33.983 --> 00:34:35.883 line:15% 
either we should nationalize it, which is what

789
00:34:35.883 --> 00:34:38.303 line:15% 
I would favor just because it's handy to have

790
00:34:38.303 --> 00:34:41.423 line:15% 
your own bank which then you can deal with

791
00:34:41.423 --> 00:34:44.473 line:15% 
other central banks and issue your currency and stuff.

792
00:34:44.843 --> 00:34:49.213 line:15% 
Or abolish it and have the treasury issue the money.

793
00:34:50.063 --> 00:34:52.073 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>The U.S. treasury issue the money, yes.</v>

794
00:34:52.363 --> 00:34:57.363 line:15% 
What do you see right now as our greatest hope rather

795
00:34:57.583 --> 00:34:59.643 line:15% 
than obstacle, we see all the obstacles,

796
00:34:59.643 --> 00:35:01.043 line:15% 
what's the greatest hope we can do,

797
00:35:01.043 --> 00:35:03.513 line:15% 
how can we participate in this process?

798
00:35:03.663 --> 00:35:06.503 line:15% 
<v ->Although it seems like a quite difficult</v>

799
00:35:06.503 --> 00:35:09.984 line:15% 
and dangerous time, it is our opportunity

800
00:35:09.984 --> 00:35:13.023 line:15% 
because the old has to fall apart before

801
00:35:13.023 --> 00:35:14.525 line:15% 
you can put in something new.

802
00:35:14.525 --> 00:35:16.825 line:15% 
We knew when Milton Friedman who I don't necessarily

803
00:35:16.825 --> 00:35:19.406 line:15% 
agree with in general, but he said back when somebody

804
00:35:19.406 --> 00:35:21.606 line:15% 
proposed a hundred percent reserve solution,

805
00:35:21.606 --> 00:35:23.147 line:15% 
he said: "Well, that's a good idea, but it's

806
00:35:23.147 --> 00:35:24.927 line:15% 
"not going to happen as long as the economy

807
00:35:24.927 --> 00:35:26.807 line:15% 
"is rolling along."

808
00:35:26.807 --> 00:35:29.707 line:15% 
But when everything collapses like in the 30s,

809
00:35:29.707 --> 00:35:32.527 line:15% 
that's when all these alternative proposals start to look

810
00:35:32.527 --> 00:35:35.247 line:15% 
pretty good, so it is our opportunity,

811
00:35:35.247 --> 00:35:40.247 line:15% 
but we have to snatch it fast because there is a sort

812
00:35:40.347 --> 00:35:45.010 line:15% 
of police state scenario that is shaping up in the meantime

813
00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:48.410 line:15% 
or global central bank that is private

814
00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:50.710 line:15% 
that would force us to borrow like everybody else

815
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:52.608 line:15% 
from this private global central bank.

816
00:35:52.608 --> 00:35:53.638 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>How do we begin doing this,</v>

817
00:35:53.638 --> 00:35:55.658 line:15% 
where do we begin applying the pressure

818
00:35:55.658 --> 00:35:59.338 line:15% 
or demanding to set down for a dialogue

819
00:35:59.338 --> 00:36:02.208 line:15% 
to create better solutions?

820
00:36:03.418 --> 00:36:05.458 line:15% 
<v ->We do need to get organized and the first thing</v>

821
00:36:05.458 --> 00:36:07.698 line:15% 
is to understand what the problem is.

822
00:36:07.698 --> 00:36:11.358 line:15% 
That's what I'm trying to do, put the information out there

823
00:36:11.358 --> 00:36:15.078 line:15% 
and then we could form, I think a political action committee

824
00:36:15.078 --> 00:36:17.918 line:15% 
would be a good idea or you can form,

825
00:36:17.918 --> 00:36:20.965 line:15% 
somebody just wrote to me wanting to form a lobby,

826
00:36:20.965 --> 00:36:24.365 line:15% 
a home-owners lobby, I think that's a great idea,

827
00:36:24.365 --> 00:36:27.475 line:15% 
but anything we can do to get organized.

828
00:36:28.285 --> 00:36:30.585 line:15% 
We need an aggressive movement and we've

829
00:36:30.585 --> 00:36:34.145 line:15% 
obviously seen that we can't just rely on voting

830
00:36:34.145 --> 00:36:37.339 line:15% 
the right leader and that they'll take care of everything.

831
00:36:37.339 --> 00:36:38.389 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Should we let those leaders know</v>

832
00:36:38.389 --> 00:36:40.489 line:15% 
that we're very unhappy with what has transpired

833
00:36:40.489 --> 00:36:42.969 line:15% 
and this is no longer sustainable in our eyes,

834
00:36:42.969 --> 00:36:44.869 line:15% 
you still need to make noise even if they are not

835
00:36:44.869 --> 00:36:46.689 line:15% 
going to effectively do anything, right?

836
00:36:46.689 --> 00:36:47.389 line:15% 
<v ->Right.</v>

837
00:36:48.121 --> 00:36:52.131 line:15% 
It's planning these ideas, we don't have to bail out

838
00:36:52.131 --> 00:36:55.051 line:15% 
these bankrupt banks, they are crooks,

839
00:36:55.051 --> 00:36:58.171 line:15% 
that we have an alternative, we can setup our own credit

840
00:36:58.171 --> 00:37:01.141 line:15% 
system, we can do exactly what they are doing

841
00:37:01.141 --> 00:37:02.253 line:15% 
much better.

842
00:37:02.253 --> 00:37:04.193 line:15% 
We've got the assets, we've got the capital,

843
00:37:04.193 --> 00:37:06.833 line:15% 
we've got the reserves, we can put all our own money

844
00:37:06.833 --> 00:37:07.813 line:15% 
in our own bank.

845
00:37:07.813 --> 00:37:09.293 line:15% 
That's what they do in North Dakota,

846
00:37:09.293 --> 00:37:12.553 line:15% 
by law all of the state's revenues go into the bank

847
00:37:12.553 --> 00:37:15.513 line:15% 
of North Dakota, so there is their huge deposit base

848
00:37:15.513 --> 00:37:18.653 line:15% 
which then they can leverage into many times

849
00:37:18.653 --> 00:37:20.075 line:15% 
that sum of loans.

850
00:37:20.075 --> 00:37:22.375 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>For people that want to follow up on this</v>

851
00:37:22.375 --> 00:37:23.935 line:15% 
and take it a little bit further,

852
00:37:23.935 --> 00:37:26.165 line:15% 
they can go to your website, is that correct?

853
00:37:26.255 --> 00:37:29.415 line:15% 
<v ->That's "Web of debt dot com" and I have many,</v>
