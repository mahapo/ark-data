00:00:00.847 --> 00:00:02.383
<v ->From the age of about five,</v>

2
00:00:02.383 --> 00:00:05.679
Mark Phillips was watched, tested, and ultimately recruited

3
00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:07.354
to become part of The Company

4
00:00:07.354 --> 00:00:10.329
which is known to the rest of us as the CIA.

5
00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:13.433
He had astonishingly quick advances in the business world

6
00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:16.250
all because, he says, he didn't ask questions.

7
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.382
In fact, he was so in the dark that he didn't even know

8
00:00:18.382 --> 00:00:20.195
who his real employer was until he was

9
00:00:20.195 --> 00:00:21.955
about 31 years of age.

10
00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.726
This is about the time when a young woman

11
00:00:23.726 --> 00:00:26.691
who he thought was a prostitute came to his attention

12
00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:28.152
through a business colleague.

13
00:00:28.152 --> 00:00:31.363
When he learned she was an MK-ULTRA mind control victim

14
00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:35.448
he decided to risk it all to save Cathy O'Brien.

(ethereal music)

16
00:00:44.674 --> 00:00:46.764
This story is one that

17
00:00:47.844 --> 00:00:49.861
most likely our viewers have never heard anything

18
00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:51.322
the likes of before.

19
00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:55.014
It's very difficult to listen to aspects of it

20
00:00:55.014 --> 00:00:58.383
and it is very, profoundly uplifting

21
00:00:58.383 --> 00:01:01.636
to see what can happen in the presence of a genuine

22
00:01:01.636 --> 00:01:03.908
and a loving presence.

23
00:01:03.908 --> 00:01:06.201
With the desire and love and connections

24
00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:09.668
and technology, etc. to bring a human being back

25
00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:13.124
from the brink of not even knowing who they were in essence.

26
00:01:13.124 --> 00:01:17.230
And this starts, both of you have your own beginning

27
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.182
but let's start with yours.

28
00:01:19.182 --> 00:01:24.131
How your life took shape from a very young age.

29
00:01:25.341 --> 00:01:29.401
<v ->I really believe it began at age six</v>

30
00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:32.280
when my mother fell off of a horse

31
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.466
that she and I were riding

32
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:37.186
and the horse stepped into her brain.

33
00:01:37.186 --> 00:01:42.186
At that point in my life I just wanted to do something

34
00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:46.328
for her, I wanted to get her help.

35
00:01:46.328 --> 00:01:49.325
She survived the accident, it left her

36
00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:51.969
severely mentally impaired.

37
00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.660
She lost her ability to smell and taste.

38
00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.567
She thought through her emotions rather than her logic.

39
00:02:00.567 --> 00:02:03.393
She was extraordinarily difficult for most people

40
00:02:03.393 --> 00:02:06.106
to deal with.

41
00:02:06.688 --> 00:02:11.688
It was not a good, healthy situation for a child.

42
00:02:12.405 --> 00:02:15.168
I had an abusive father who-

43
00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:17.674
I was raised in a wealthy family and

44
00:02:17.674 --> 00:02:22.674
my father was physically and psychologically abusive

45
00:02:22.901 --> 00:02:27.028
and it left me with a speech impairment.

46
00:02:27.028 --> 00:02:29.428
Which, at that point in time-

47
00:02:29.428 --> 00:02:32.585
I was born May the 17th, 1943 so

48
00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:37.108
this was in the mid forties when they really didn't know

49
00:02:37.108 --> 00:02:38.900
why I couldn't talk.

50
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.385
All of a sudden, I was quite the talker up until

51
00:02:41.385 --> 00:02:44.190
I was about six and rather than take me

52
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.211
to a psychologist or a psychiatrist to be analyzed

53
00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:51.571
they just assumed that I didn't A, want to talk

54
00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:56.571
or B, had some sort of mental impairment.

55
00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.330
So, in essence, it was because I felt

56
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.901
I could no longer express myself.

57
00:03:03.901 --> 00:03:07.623
Going through school and being unable to talk,

58
00:03:07.623 --> 00:03:11.538
I could mutter a few words but beyond that-

59
00:03:11.538 --> 00:03:14.673
I had a grandmother, my mother's mother that I could

60
00:03:14.673 --> 00:03:17.767
speak with and she was about the only person

61
00:03:17.767 --> 00:03:21.437
aside from going out into the forest and talking to trees.

62
00:03:21.437 --> 00:03:25.403
I couldn't sing but I found out that I could sing words.

63
00:03:27.463 --> 00:03:31.291
It gave me the impetus to want to become

64
00:03:31.291 --> 00:03:33.680
not necessarily a brain surgeon

65
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.888
but someone who works with the mind.

66
00:03:35.888 --> 00:03:38.885
And I had this at the forefront of my own mind.

67
00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:39.760
<v ->Even at a young age.</v>

68
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.254
<v ->Even from that young age.</v>

69
00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:43.920
I wanted to become a scientist.

70
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.280
I had opportunities in school to excel in certain areas

71
00:03:53.096 --> 00:03:56.489
that would ensure that I could become a scientist

72
00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.976
in these areas and I remember the disappointment

73
00:03:59.976 --> 00:04:02.642
when I failed so miserably at chemistry

74
00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:05.426
and I was such a horrible mathematician

75
00:04:05.426 --> 00:04:10.323
and they discovered that I was dyslexic, severely dyslexic.

76
00:04:10.323 --> 00:04:13.340
As a result, of course those dreams

77
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.220
of becoming a mind scientist were dashed.

78
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.166
Well, moving forward in my life,

79
00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:25.659
I had the displeasure of becoming drafted

80
00:04:26.596 --> 00:04:28.548
for the Vietnam War.

81
00:04:28.548 --> 00:04:31.961
I moved, cleverly moved, my draft ward around the country

82
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:35.310
and the last place to call was Alabama.

83
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.232
I'm a native Tennessean.

84
00:04:38.232 --> 00:04:40.344
And I moved my draft ward to Alabama

85
00:04:40.344 --> 00:04:43.715
and had moved to Atlanta and had applied

86
00:04:43.715 --> 00:04:46.637
for a number of jobs, I was going to school at night,

87
00:04:47.867 --> 00:04:49.894
going to college at night and

88
00:04:49.894 --> 00:04:53.243
was actually driving a forklift for the pipe company

89
00:04:53.243 --> 00:04:55.888
to support myself and

90
00:04:55.888 --> 00:04:59.462
my draft ward called me or sent me a letter,

91
00:04:59.462 --> 00:05:02.437
told me to report to Montgomery, Alabama,

92
00:05:02.437 --> 00:05:04.945
the Air Force base there, which I did.

93
00:05:04.945 --> 00:05:06.865
And I thought, "Well this is the end of the world

94
00:05:06.865 --> 00:05:07.941
"as I know it."

95
00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:11.599
And I got a doctor to write an excuse

96
00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:15.503
saying that I had all kinds of problems

97
00:05:15.503 --> 00:05:20.503
from alcoholism to speech impairment to

98
00:05:21.444 --> 00:05:23.428
all these things I didn't even drink.

99
00:05:23.428 --> 00:05:26.283
My father was an alcoholic, I was scared of it.

100
00:05:26.283 --> 00:05:28.768
Nevertheless he wrote all these things and I thought,

101
00:05:28.768 --> 00:05:30.603
"Well this might save me."

102
00:05:30.603 --> 00:05:34.229
So I turned that in and when they called my name-

103
00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:38.485
By the way, my real name is Marquart

104
00:05:38.485 --> 00:05:42.506
and when they call my name they call it as Margaret

105
00:05:42.506 --> 00:05:45.215
and I got to hear about 7,000 young men

106
00:05:45.215 --> 00:05:48.511
just scream in laughter.

107
00:05:48.511 --> 00:05:49.578
<v ->Yeah, Margaret.</v>

108
00:05:49.578 --> 00:05:50.441
<v ->Yes.</v>

109
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:53.161
So I stepped up and they called me up

110
00:05:53.161 --> 00:05:58.014
and rather than send me through all the physical stuff

111
00:05:58.014 --> 00:06:02.697
they sent me directly into a closed room area

112
00:06:02.697 --> 00:06:06.163
that was in the back of this enormous hanger

113
00:06:06.163 --> 00:06:09.151
that we were all bunked in together with.

114
00:06:10.181 --> 00:06:11.948
And when I went in there, there were a number

115
00:06:11.948 --> 00:06:15.107
of military brass sitting around a very large table

116
00:06:15.107 --> 00:06:17.783
and there were also some men in suits there.

117
00:06:17.783 --> 00:06:21.729
The guys in suits were very friendly towards me.

118
00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:25.462
<v ->And this is what happened with most draftees?</v>

119
00:06:25.462 --> 00:06:27.553
<v ->I don't know, I really don't know.</v>

120
00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:30.390
I've heard different stories from different guys.

121
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.750
But I found out a lot of information there.

122
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.090
Right there on the spot.

123
00:06:37.047 --> 00:06:41.205
They said, one of the military brass said,

124
00:06:41.205 --> 00:06:42.688
"We understand that you do not want to fight

125
00:06:42.688 --> 00:06:45.130
in this man's army because you're a coward."

126
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.799
Or something to that effect, it was I think a little more

127
00:06:50.299 --> 00:06:52.149
I think there were a couple of cuss words used.

128
00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:55.466
The guy was really angry looking at me.

129
00:06:57.096 --> 00:07:00.328
He said, "We don't know why,

130
00:07:00.335 --> 00:07:03.279
"these gentlemen here would like to talk with you

131
00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:07.113
"about serving your country in another way."

132
00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:11.731
And I'm thinking whoa.

133
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:13.774
What could I do?

134
00:07:13.774 --> 00:07:16.730
So they call me over and they said,

135
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.395
they introduced themselves, they showed me

136
00:07:19.395 --> 00:07:21.923
Department of Defense credentials

137
00:07:21.923 --> 00:07:26.755
much like an FBI guy flashes his credentials.

138
00:07:26.755 --> 00:07:31.373
They said DOD and then under it, it said DID,

139
00:07:31.373 --> 00:07:34.114
Defense Intelligence Agency.

140
00:07:34.114 --> 00:07:36.674
Believe it or not, I did not even know

141
00:07:36.674 --> 00:07:40.130
what the intelligence community was.

142
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.703
I had heard of the CIA, I had never heard of anything else.

143
00:07:43.703 --> 00:07:48.257
I'd heard of the KGB from newspaper articles.

144
00:07:48.257 --> 00:07:51.533
Never about any sort of intelligence community.

145
00:07:51.533 --> 00:07:53.622
Well at that point they said, "We have been

146
00:07:53.622 --> 00:07:55.521
"monitoring you since-"

147
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:59.361
I think he said the fourth or fifth grade, grade school.

148
00:07:59.361 --> 00:08:01.579
He said, "All children in public schools

149
00:08:01.579 --> 00:08:05.995
"and most private schools, they are subjected to

150
00:08:05.995 --> 00:08:08.523
"psychological testing and IQ testing

151
00:08:08.523 --> 00:08:13.523
"at least three times before grade 12."

152
00:08:13.672 --> 00:08:15.564
(coughs) Pardon me.

153
00:08:15.805 --> 00:08:17.779
At that point in time he said,

154
00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:21.788
"We believe you would be a great candidate

155
00:08:21.788 --> 00:08:24.956
"for working within the intelligence community."

156
00:08:24.956 --> 00:08:28.712
And I'm thinking, this guy thinks I'm that intelligent?

157
00:08:28.712 --> 00:08:33.696
I was equating intelligence with the word intelligent.

158
00:08:33.894 --> 00:08:36.913
Well he said, "We will call you.

159
00:08:36.913 --> 00:08:40.665
He said, "You collect your things, get on the bus,

160
00:08:40.665 --> 00:08:43.331
"go back to Atlanta," he said, "and you can expect

161
00:08:43.331 --> 00:08:45.581
"a contact from us."

162
00:08:45.581 --> 00:08:48.248
Well I went back to Atlanta and I got a phone call

163
00:08:48.248 --> 00:08:51.106
within a few short days afterwards.

164
00:08:51.106 --> 00:08:56.106
I had applied as a sales engineer for the Ampex Corporation.

165
00:08:57.834 --> 00:08:59.552
<v ->Can you talk a little bit about Ampex?</v>

166
00:08:59.552 --> 00:09:00.202
<v ->Yeah.</v>

167
00:09:00.202 --> 00:09:05.202
Ampex was a military industrial provider, a huge one.

168
00:09:08.469 --> 00:09:11.754
They basically invented magnetic tape or

169
00:09:11.754 --> 00:09:16.000
not the theory, that was actually done in Nazi Germany

170
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.734
but they invented the whole idea of magnetic tape.

171
00:09:20.734 --> 00:09:21.662
<v ->For recording.</v>

172
00:09:21.662 --> 00:09:24.021
<v ->For recording both video and audio.</v>

173
00:09:24.021 --> 00:09:28.425
They also invented at that time the instant replay.

174
00:09:28.425 --> 00:09:29.704
<v ->Okay.</v>

175
00:09:29.704 --> 00:09:31.379
<v ->Which really put them on the map.</v>

176
00:09:31.379 --> 00:09:36.379
Well their industrial lines were selling larger,

177
00:09:37.811 --> 00:09:42.472
selling to studios, recording studios, television studios,

178
00:09:42.472 --> 00:09:46.183
and to military operations for instrumentation tape

179
00:09:46.183 --> 00:09:47.879
and computer tape.

180
00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:50.088
<v ->And you were to be a sales person?</v>

181
00:09:50.088 --> 00:09:51.570
<v ->That was my understanding.</v>

182
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.522
I was gonna be a sales representative.

183
00:09:53.522 --> 00:09:58.236
And then they upped the ante and said a sales engineer.

184
00:09:58.236 --> 00:10:01.565
They said I was gonna have to go through engineering school

185
00:10:01.565 --> 00:10:06.565
at Georgia Tech at night and my blood just turned ice cold

186
00:10:06.758 --> 00:10:09.574
because I knew that required math.

187
00:10:09.574 --> 00:10:11.195
<v ->And you were still dyslexic?</v>

188
00:10:11.195 --> 00:10:12.987
<v ->Yes, and at that point in time there were over</v>

189
00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:17.987
200 applicants and I stand to be corrected on that,

190
00:10:18.181 --> 00:10:19.899
it might be double that number,

191
00:10:19.899 --> 00:10:22.875
but there were over 200 applicants for that job

192
00:10:22.875 --> 00:10:26.746
because with that job you got an automatic deferment

193
00:10:26.746 --> 00:10:29.914
and that was another reason I'd applied for it.

194
00:10:29.914 --> 00:10:32.902
It was published in the newspaper that way.

195
00:10:34.067 --> 00:10:36.532
So when they call me up they said we'd like

196
00:10:36.532 --> 00:10:38.643
you to come in for the second interview.

197
00:10:38.643 --> 00:10:40.820
So I went in for the second interview and then that's when

198
00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:44.626
they told me I needed to see the company psychologist

199
00:10:44.626 --> 00:10:48.263
and psychiatrist and undergo some testing.

200
00:10:48.263 --> 00:10:52.562
Well I was pressed for time.

201
00:10:52.562 --> 00:10:56.572
It was embarrassing because I couldn't afford to lose my job

202
00:10:56.572 --> 00:11:01.521
running the forklift and I didn't want to fail my courses

203
00:11:01.521 --> 00:11:05.190
that I was taking at night in school.

204
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:08.070
So I was most uncomfortable with the whole ordeal

205
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.343
because I knew I was gonna fail.

206
00:11:10.343 --> 00:11:13.179
When I went for the first interview,

207
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:18.406
the psychologist was an incredibly nice man.

208
00:11:18.406 --> 00:11:21.840
He gave me a lot of tests and then he cued me in.

209
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.349
He said, "You'll be working for the intelligence community."

210
00:11:25.349 --> 00:11:26.757
I said, "What is that?"

211
00:11:26.757 --> 00:11:29.658
And he said, "It's like the CIA."

212
00:11:29.658 --> 00:11:32.357
He said, "You'll be working for the Department of Defense

213
00:11:32.357 --> 00:11:35.930
"and you need a top secret clearance.

214
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.183
"It will start out as a secret clearance of a certain level

215
00:11:39.183 --> 00:11:41.967
"and then it will be elevated as time goes on

216
00:11:41.967 --> 00:11:45.828
"and your exposure to various projects."

217
00:11:45.828 --> 00:11:47.844
I said, "Well what am I gonna be doing?"

218
00:11:47.844 --> 00:11:49.657
First thing in my mind was I guess they want me

219
00:11:49.657 --> 00:11:51.929
to haul around radioactive material.

220
00:11:51.929 --> 00:11:54.553
I mean I really had no self confidence

221
00:11:54.553 --> 00:11:55.855
at that point in my life.

222
00:11:55.855 --> 00:11:57.219
<v ->Well sure, you were very young.</v>

223
00:11:57.219 --> 00:12:00.334
<v ->I was very young and very frightened.</v>

224
00:12:02.164 --> 00:12:06.424
At that point, they brought me into,

225
00:12:06.424 --> 00:12:10.136
they told me they said fine and this guy, he said,

226
00:12:10.136 --> 00:12:13.154
"Now you're gonna be interviewed by a psychiatrist."

227
00:12:13.154 --> 00:12:16.727
He said, "Never, ever lie."

228
00:12:16.727 --> 00:12:21.164
He said, "Whatever you do," he said, "Don't ever

229
00:12:21.164 --> 00:12:22.625
"lie about anything.

230
00:12:22.625 --> 00:12:24.300
"Don't embellish anything.

231
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.849
"If you don't know the answer, tell him."

232
00:12:26.849 --> 00:12:28.524
I said, "Well I'm gonna fail because

233
00:12:28.524 --> 00:12:30.220
"my math skills are so horrible."

234
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.471
He said, "We know that."

235
00:12:32.471 --> 00:12:34.859
I said, "Well (coughs) I'm supposed to go

236
00:12:34.859 --> 00:12:36.118
"to engineering school."

237
00:12:36.118 --> 00:12:37.857
He said, "You're only supposed to go there

238
00:12:37.857 --> 00:12:39.392
"to learn terms."

239
00:12:39.392 --> 00:12:41.248
He said, "You gotta fit in."

240
00:12:41.248 --> 00:12:42.891
He said, "You don't have to be an engineer."

241
00:12:42.891 --> 00:12:45.867
He said, "You're gonna be learning a lot of things."

242
00:12:45.867 --> 00:12:48.821
He said, "What they want you to do is

243
00:12:48.821 --> 00:12:51.690
"they want you to learn how to speak clearly.

244
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:55.295
"They want you to learn how to become the role,

245
00:12:55.295 --> 00:12:58.730
"whatever's necessary and they want you to do this

246
00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.516
"in secret while working for the Ampex Corporation."

247
00:13:02.516 --> 00:13:04.586
And he said, "And your tenure at the Ampex Corporation

248
00:13:04.586 --> 00:13:07.412
"may last a year, may last two years, it may last five,

249
00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:09.759
"it may last six months and they may move you

250
00:13:09.759 --> 00:13:12.425
"into another position with another company."

251
00:13:12.425 --> 00:13:14.825
Well they did, many companies.

252
00:13:16.945 --> 00:13:21.630
The point was, this testing went on for months

253
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:24.552
and months and months until finally one day,

254
00:13:24.552 --> 00:13:28.158
out of sheer frustration I told them, I said,

255
00:13:28.158 --> 00:13:30.824
"If I take one more day off from my job

256
00:13:30.824 --> 00:13:32.477
"I'm gonna lose it."

257
00:13:32.477 --> 00:13:35.165
And they said, "You mean you're not receiving

258
00:13:35.165 --> 00:13:37.042
"any paychecks for this?"

259
00:13:37.042 --> 00:13:39.111
I said, "No."

260
00:13:39.111 --> 00:13:41.341
Because I still hadn't been hired.

261
00:13:41.341 --> 00:13:45.543
And so they sent me a check for three months pay

262
00:13:45.543 --> 00:13:49.788
at more money in that three months than I would've made

263
00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:53.276
in two years working with the pipe thing.

264
00:13:53.276 --> 00:13:58.276
So I retired as a pipe guy and decided that I could make it.

265
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.142
Even if they didn't hire me, I could find another job.

266
00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:04.464
<v ->Right.</v>

267
00:14:04.464 --> 00:14:06.096
<v ->On what they paid me.</v>

268
00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:08.902
Well the fact of the matter was they hired me.

269
00:14:10.201 --> 00:14:15.201
After they hired me, I had some incredible opportunities.

270
00:14:16.024 --> 00:14:20.281
The first thing, and this is all D classified,

271
00:14:20.281 --> 00:14:23.181
the first thing that they assigned me to was

272
00:14:23.181 --> 00:14:27.192
the Emory University campus there in Atlanta, Georgia.

273
00:14:27.192 --> 00:14:32.192
They were buying a lot of our product for research purposes

274
00:14:32.258 --> 00:14:35.788
at the communicable disease center, the CDC,

275
00:14:35.788 --> 00:14:38.060
which is right there on their campus.

276
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.501
They also had the Yerkes Primate Center right on that campus

277
00:14:42.501 --> 00:14:45.988
and they also had, and I'll use the term

278
00:14:45.988 --> 00:14:47.076
and it's not correct.

279
00:14:47.076 --> 00:14:49.700
I don't know what the name of the project was there.

280
00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.945
But it was basically what is known as the MK-ULTRA project

281
00:14:53.945 --> 00:14:57.433
which is the government's now declassified term

282
00:14:57.433 --> 00:14:59.566
for mind control research.

283
00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:01.476
And this mind control research was for

284
00:15:01.476 --> 00:15:04.867
behavioral modification on monkeys and apes

285
00:15:04.867 --> 00:15:06.329
and this sort of thing.

286
00:15:06.329 --> 00:15:09.720
Because the Russians had lost a spacecraft,

287
00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.267
they had lost some astronauts,

288
00:15:11.267 --> 00:15:13.688
and NASA was deathly afraid they were gonna have

289
00:15:13.688 --> 00:15:14.989
the same thing.

290
00:15:14.989 --> 00:15:19.245
So they thought well, we better have a backup plan.

291
00:15:19.245 --> 00:15:21.634
So we're gonna teach these monkeys and apes how to

292
00:15:21.634 --> 00:15:23.426
operate a rocket ship.

293
00:15:23.426 --> 00:15:26.370
<v ->Just one question for clarification at this point.</v>

294
00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:28.002
When you were going through the battery

295
00:15:28.002 --> 00:15:30.989
of psychological and psychiatric testing,

296
00:15:32.089 --> 00:15:35.227
once it was all past, you can see patterns now

297
00:15:35.227 --> 00:15:37.658
in terms of what were they looking for in you?

298
00:15:37.658 --> 00:15:39.888
<v ->They were looking to see-</v>

299
00:15:39.888 --> 00:15:41.679
I mean, this is my impression.

300
00:15:41.679 --> 00:15:42.491
<v ->Yes.</v>

301
00:15:42.491 --> 00:15:46.063
<v ->Only (coughs) excuse me, my throat.</v>

302
00:15:46.063 --> 00:15:48.580
They were looking to see if I had the integrity

303
00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.852
to keep secrets.

304
00:15:50.852 --> 00:15:53.540
They knew that I had spent so many years

305
00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:57.188
living inside my own head and keeping secrets

306
00:15:57.188 --> 00:16:00.718
and that I had learned by sheer observation

307
00:16:00.718 --> 00:16:04.431
that by keeping secrets, people's feelings were saved

308
00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:07.640
and embarrassing situations were avoided.

309
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.147
And so I had learned to keep secrets

310
00:16:10.147 --> 00:16:13.816
kind of as a knee-jerk response to a problem

311
00:16:13.816 --> 00:16:17.645
that I was quickly overcoming because I was being given

312
00:16:17.645 --> 00:16:22.645
speech therapy, I was being given public communications-

313
00:16:22.915 --> 00:16:24.866
<v ->But that pattern, that psychiatric pattern in you</v>

314
00:16:24.866 --> 00:16:25.954
had already been set?

315
00:16:25.954 --> 00:16:26.957
<v ->Yes, indeed it had.</v>

316
00:16:26.957 --> 00:16:29.484
<v ->So secrets were part of your internal makeup</v>

317
00:16:29.484 --> 00:16:31.832
and they were looking to see how deep and reliable

318
00:16:31.832 --> 00:16:33.708
this part of your makeup was.

319
00:16:33.708 --> 00:16:36.641
So now you're, okay, I just wanted that clarification.

320
00:16:36.641 --> 00:16:39.489
So now you, MK-ULTRA.

321
00:16:39.489 --> 00:16:44.489
<v ->Well at this point I was able to watch monkeys</v>

322
00:16:44.833 --> 00:16:48.640
and higher apes to be trained to do various jobs.

323
00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.891
Learn American Sign Language,

324
00:16:52.991 --> 00:16:55.841
develop extraordinary communication skills,

325
00:16:55.841 --> 00:16:58.709
things that I had never dreamed these apes

326
00:16:58.709 --> 00:17:00.661
were capable of doing.

327
00:17:00.661 --> 00:17:02.664
And I even developed friendships among

328
00:17:02.664 --> 00:17:04.296
the people that worked there.

329
00:17:04.296 --> 00:17:07.058
And my job was more of a bag man.

330
00:17:07.058 --> 00:17:11.933
I was operating only as the fellow who took the film,

331
00:17:11.933 --> 00:17:16.933
the file tapes, video tapes, and they went into a red bag

332
00:17:16.988 --> 00:17:19.292
and they were sealed and I took them back

333
00:17:19.292 --> 00:17:22.961
to Fort George Meade, Maryland where they were analyzed.

334
00:17:22.961 --> 00:17:25.094
Where they went from there, I don't know.

335
00:17:25.094 --> 00:17:27.046
That was my job.

336
00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:29.350
I mean I just sat there and made sure

337
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:32.710
that the tape that came out of the cameras

338
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:36.294
went into that bag and there were no other copies made.

339
00:17:36.294 --> 00:17:40.816
And there were other things that I did like

340
00:17:40.816 --> 00:17:43.632
I went over phone records of people

341
00:17:43.632 --> 00:17:45.072
that worked in these places.

342
00:17:45.072 --> 00:17:48.986
I made sure that in some cases their cars were bugged,

343
00:17:48.986 --> 00:17:51.408
and their houses were bugged, and these sort of things.

344
00:17:51.408 --> 00:17:54.053
Although I didn't have to do the physical bugging,

345
00:17:54.053 --> 00:17:57.786
I had to review the conversations that they were having

346
00:17:57.786 --> 00:17:59.812
in their everyday lives to make sure they weren't

347
00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:01.967
talking about what they were involved with.

348
00:18:01.967 --> 00:18:04.313
<v ->Now, did this all seem pretty normal to you?</v>

349
00:18:04.313 --> 00:18:05.892
You were still a very young man.

350
00:18:05.892 --> 00:18:08.398
<v ->Yes, but I also learned that, or at least felt like,</v>

351
00:18:08.398 --> 00:18:11.492
that this was a defense department issue

352
00:18:11.492 --> 00:18:14.574
and that I was doing my job as a

353
00:18:14.574 --> 00:18:18.776
"soldier working on American soil for the benefit

354
00:18:18.776 --> 00:18:20.782
"of all Americans."

355
00:18:20.782 --> 00:18:25.782
And I was convinced, totally convinced at that point in time

356
00:18:25.912 --> 00:18:30.509
that some of the forecasts that I'd heard (coughs)

357
00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:34.360
about behavioral modification being the wave of the future

358
00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.071
that we could essentially empty out our prisons

359
00:18:38.071 --> 00:18:40.727
and mental institutions because the next step

360
00:18:40.727 --> 00:18:42.787
from working with primates is

361
00:18:42.787 --> 00:18:46.081
I went into the mental institutions, both state and federal.

362
00:18:46.081 --> 00:18:48.759
And I went into state and federal prisons

363
00:18:48.759 --> 00:18:51.724
where people were, honest to God, volunteers.

364
00:18:51.724 --> 00:18:55.073
There was no torture or anything like that done.

365
00:18:55.073 --> 00:18:58.582
It was more in terms of drugs, using

366
00:18:59.722 --> 00:19:03.332
experimental hypnosis, it was doing some

367
00:19:03.332 --> 00:19:08.332
brain wave training, it was very mild electric shock.

368
00:19:08.996 --> 00:19:12.014
I mean, much lighter than a nine volt battery,

369
00:19:12.014 --> 00:19:13.475
you could barely feel it.

370
00:19:13.475 --> 00:19:14.990
Stuff like that that would stimulate

371
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:17.166
various regions of the brain.

372
00:19:17.166 --> 00:19:20.728
And I went from that sort of research on these people-

373
00:19:20.728 --> 00:19:25.112
I mean, we're talking about incorrigible people who

374
00:19:25.112 --> 00:19:30.112
could not even function in a padded cell

375
00:19:31.128 --> 00:19:32.494
without hurting themselves.

376
00:19:32.494 --> 00:19:35.586
<v ->So you were genuinely doing something that you felt</v>

377
00:19:35.586 --> 00:19:37.421
was going to make a difference to the world?

378
00:19:37.421 --> 00:19:38.978
<v ->Yeah, indeed.</v>

379
00:19:38.978 --> 00:19:42.019
And then I had befriended so many of these scientists

380
00:19:42.019 --> 00:19:44.844
and had learned so much that they actually started

381
00:19:44.844 --> 00:19:47.885
allowing me to do parts of interviews

382
00:19:47.885 --> 00:19:49.794
with some of the people.

383
00:19:52.214 --> 00:19:53.302
Frankly, I was happy.

384
00:19:53.302 --> 00:19:55.297
This was one of the best jobs that I ever had

385
00:19:55.297 --> 00:19:57.622
and could imagine having in my whole life.

386
00:19:57.622 --> 00:20:00.385
All while I'm thinking that I'm gonna learn something

387
00:20:00.385 --> 00:20:03.520
I can help my mother with and make her

388
00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.467
more independent and less dependent upon me

389
00:20:07.467 --> 00:20:11.876
because I was having to support her and take care of her.

390
00:20:12.181 --> 00:20:14.870
Her father was alive at that time but she was

391
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:15.967
really having to take care of him

392
00:20:15.967 --> 00:20:17.941
and she couldn't even take care of herself.

393
00:20:17.941 --> 00:20:19.126
<v ->Alcoholism?</v>

394
00:20:19.126 --> 00:20:20.394
<v ->No, her father.</v>

395
00:20:20.394 --> 00:20:21.578
She had divorced my father.

396
00:20:21.578 --> 00:20:24.388
<v ->Gotchya, gotchya.</v>

397
00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:28.201
<v ->So when I moved away from the prisons-</v>

398
00:20:29.731 --> 00:20:32.052
And by the way I went from Ampex,

399
00:20:32.052 --> 00:20:36.094
they moved me to the Codman Shurtleff division

400
00:20:36.094 --> 00:20:38.003
of Johnson &amp; Johnson.

401
00:20:38.003 --> 00:20:42.395
The Codman Shurtleff division is the medical instruments

402
00:20:42.395 --> 00:20:46.117
division for surgeries.

403
00:20:46.117 --> 00:20:50.267
I am not one to want to look at blood product.

404
00:20:50.267 --> 00:20:53.082
I am not one to want to watch surgery.

405
00:20:54.062 --> 00:20:57.210
I have even difficulties watching my own finger

406
00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:59.119
or hand being sewn up.

407
00:20:59.119 --> 00:21:01.487
I don't like that sort of thing.

408
00:21:01.487 --> 00:21:04.549
And I was subjected to brain surgeries.

409
00:21:05.629 --> 00:21:09.103
That was the shortest lived job, assignment,

410
00:21:09.103 --> 00:21:12.091
that I had because I fainted (laughs).

411
00:21:12.091 --> 00:21:13.775
<v ->That'll take care of it (laughs).</v>

412
00:21:13.775 --> 00:21:16.004
<v ->A young man was brought in and he had been injured</v>

413
00:21:16.004 --> 00:21:19.076
in a football accident and I happened to be

414
00:21:19.076 --> 00:21:21.283
in that particular hospital at the time

415
00:21:21.283 --> 00:21:23.950
and the doctors that I happened to work with

416
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:27.917
who had clearance said, "We've got cameras in there,

417
00:21:27.917 --> 00:21:29.965
"let's go in there and let's film this thing.

418
00:21:29.965 --> 00:21:31.661
"We're gonna put a (mumbles)"

419
00:21:31.661 --> 00:21:35.670
that's a drill bit in the kid's head, relieve the pressure,

420
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.112
and see what we can do.

421
00:21:37.112 --> 00:21:40.365
In the meantime, we'll see how much brain damage is there

422
00:21:40.365 --> 00:21:43.383
and we'll do a dia study real quick

423
00:21:43.383 --> 00:21:46.189
and we'll get it all on video and you can ship it back

424
00:21:46.189 --> 00:21:49.281
and it'll be something of a little bonus.

425
00:21:49.281 --> 00:21:51.745
He said it'll look good for everybody.

426
00:21:51.745 --> 00:21:53.367
Well I went in there, they put the (mumbles)

427
00:21:53.367 --> 00:21:56.246
in his head and it was so much pressure in there

428
00:21:56.246 --> 00:21:59.180
it exploded and his brains came out of his head.

429
00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.129
<v ->Okay.</v>

430
00:22:00.129 --> 00:22:01.686
<v ->So that was all I could take.</v>

431
00:22:01.686 --> 00:22:04.214
I passed out and when I passed out,

432
00:22:04.214 --> 00:22:08.096
being a 200-odd pound guy, six feet tall,

433
00:22:08.096 --> 00:22:12.160
I made a big mess and fell over a whole lot of stuff.

434
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.621
I mean I wasn't one of these that crumpled,

435
00:22:13.621 --> 00:22:15.147
I just went down.

436
00:22:15.147 --> 00:22:16.288
<v ->So that wasn't your gig.</v>

437
00:22:16.288 --> 00:22:17.216
<v ->No.</v>

438
00:22:17.216 --> 00:22:19.520
So I got away from that very quickly.

439
00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.301
I called my boss and I said, "Look,

440
00:22:21.301 --> 00:22:22.719
"can't do it."

441
00:22:22.719 --> 00:22:24.235
He said, "I already know."

442
00:22:24.235 --> 00:22:26.527
He said, "What can you do?"

443
00:22:26.527 --> 00:22:28.991
I said, "Well, I liked the job that I had."

444
00:22:28.991 --> 00:22:33.140
And he said, "Well, that job is gone.

445
00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.191
"And I think it's important you know why that job is gone."

446
00:22:36.191 --> 00:22:39.721
Ampex Corporation was a California corporation.

447
00:22:39.721 --> 00:22:42.825
At the time, the president and the

448
00:22:43.945 --> 00:22:48.702
founder of it, Alexander M. Poniatoff, a Russian scientist,

449
00:22:48.702 --> 00:22:52.840
but I can't recall the president's name.

450
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:57.620
They went up against a fellow by the name of Ronald Reagan,

451
00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.264
who happened to be governor of California at that time.

452
00:23:00.264 --> 00:23:03.773
Ronald Reagan was attempting to float a bill

453
00:23:05.983 --> 00:23:09.531
that the state tax would pay for

454
00:23:09.531 --> 00:23:14.531
that would in essence allow the state run prisons

455
00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:18.948
to torture prisoners into a submissive state

456
00:23:18.948 --> 00:23:21.710
to where they could control their minds.

457
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:25.966
And Ampex had the only, they had a lot of the equipment.

458
00:23:25.966 --> 00:23:28.654
They, along with the General Medical Corporation

459
00:23:28.654 --> 00:23:33.582
really were in a position to say yes or no.

460
00:23:33.582 --> 00:23:36.441
In one sense, in another sense they had no say.

461
00:23:36.441 --> 00:23:38.478
And the president of Ampex said no,

462
00:23:38.478 --> 00:23:40.430
we're not involved with this

463
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:42.914
and lost a campaign against the governor.

464
00:23:42.914 --> 00:23:45.635
Not knowing that Ronald Reagan was hand-picked

465
00:23:45.635 --> 00:23:48.535
for the presidency later on, many years down the road.

466
00:23:48.535 --> 00:23:49.559
<v ->Right.</v>

467
00:23:49.559 --> 00:23:52.738
<v ->You realize these people work 25 years in most cases</v>

468
00:23:52.738 --> 00:23:55.959
ahead of what the average individual knows.

469
00:23:55.959 --> 00:23:59.169
And the stuff that I was seeing that was being done,

470
00:23:59.169 --> 00:24:02.422
much of it still hasn't surfaced

471
00:24:03.832 --> 00:24:06.650
as far as through, into the general public.

472
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:10.458
<v ->So that job is gone with Ampex.</v>

473
00:24:10.458 --> 00:24:11.919
<v ->Yeah, the job is gone with Ampex.</v>

474
00:24:11.919 --> 00:24:14.244
Ampex was completely destroyed overnight

475
00:24:14.244 --> 00:24:15.780
as a military industrial supplier.

476
00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.009
20 some-odd thousand people were let go.

477
00:24:18.009 --> 00:24:19.888
I was the only one left in the office.

478
00:24:19.888 --> 00:24:22.788
That's when I got transferred to Codman Shurtleff.

479
00:24:22.788 --> 00:24:27.300
That job lasted, it took them longer to train me

480
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.646
to be able to communicate with these doctors

481
00:24:29.646 --> 00:24:31.843
than the job lasted.

482
00:24:31.843 --> 00:24:34.958
It took them I think four months to train me

483
00:24:34.958 --> 00:24:37.997
and the job lasted three months.

484
00:24:37.997 --> 00:24:41.412
So in a little over half a year I was done with that one.

485
00:24:41.412 --> 00:24:43.480
And they said, "Well what would you like to do?"

486
00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.082
I said, "I'm a pilot.

487
00:24:46.082 --> 00:24:48.173
"How about something in the glamor business?"

488
00:24:48.173 --> 00:24:51.533
Then they offered me a job with Revlon of all places.

489
00:24:51.533 --> 00:24:55.021
And I thought, "No."

490
00:24:55.021 --> 00:24:58.434
<v ->This is still part of the intelligence industry?</v>

491
00:24:58.434 --> 00:25:00.482
So they were putting you with Revlon?

492
00:25:00.482 --> 00:25:03.639
<v ->The intelligence community is in every facet of industry.</v>

493
00:25:03.639 --> 00:25:06.145
<v ->But Revlon just is kind of throwing me a bit here.</v>

494
00:25:06.145 --> 00:25:07.116
I wouldn't have expected that.

495
00:25:07.116 --> 00:25:08.598
<v ->That's an easy one for me to understand</v>

496
00:25:08.598 --> 00:25:12.555
but nevertheless I turned the job down because

497
00:25:12.555 --> 00:25:14.571
I had done some male modeling

498
00:25:14.571 --> 00:25:17.984
of Western clothes and things to supplement my income

499
00:25:17.984 --> 00:25:20.885
way back before I ever got involved in this.

500
00:25:22.255 --> 00:25:24.288
So that didn't appeal to me in the least

501
00:25:24.288 --> 00:25:26.816
because of people being so phony.

502
00:25:26.816 --> 00:25:27.701
<v ->But give me an idea.</v>

503
00:25:27.701 --> 00:25:29.675
Why would you have intelligence in Revlon?

504
00:25:29.675 --> 00:25:31.211
I mean just, I'm naive.

505
00:25:31.211 --> 00:25:32.639
<v ->It's an international corporation.</v>

506
00:25:32.639 --> 00:25:34.198
<v ->Okay so just by virtue of-</v>

507
00:25:34.198 --> 00:25:36.916
<v ->Yeah, it's like Coca-Cola was the first one in.</v>

508
00:25:36.916 --> 00:25:39.263
Coca-Cola probably has more CIA officers

509
00:25:40.723 --> 00:25:43.380
involved in their overseas operations than

510
00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.002
any other corporation in the world.

511
00:25:45.002 --> 00:25:45.609
<v ->Okay.</v>

512
00:25:45.609 --> 00:25:48.276
<v ->McDonald's the same way and the list goes on.</v>

513
00:25:48.276 --> 00:25:50.026
Revlon is a huge one.

514
00:25:50.026 --> 00:25:51.273
<v ->Okay.</v>

515
00:25:51.273 --> 00:25:53.875
<v ->The long and short of it was that they said,</v>

516
00:25:53.875 --> 00:25:56.010
"Well, you're a pilot."

517
00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:58.430
I said, "Yes I am, I have my own airplane."

518
00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:02.771
They said, "Well how about aviation?"

519
00:26:02.771 --> 00:26:06.227
I said, "That's absolutely wonderful."

520
00:26:06.227 --> 00:26:07.901
So they said we're gonna move you back

521
00:26:07.901 --> 00:26:11.432
to your original home, Nashville, Tennessee.

522
00:26:11.432 --> 00:26:15.581
I thought, "Why in the world would they move me there?"

523
00:26:15.581 --> 00:26:20.253
So they said, "You just go back home, take a nice rest,

524
00:26:20.253 --> 00:26:23.964
"wait'll you hear from us, and we'll send you a job offer."

525
00:26:23.964 --> 00:26:25.361
They said, "You go out for an interview,

526
00:26:25.361 --> 00:26:27.473
"act like you want the job,

527
00:26:27.473 --> 00:26:29.255
"and take whatever they offer you."

528
00:26:29.255 --> 00:26:30.652
And he said, "And the pay will be

529
00:26:30.652 --> 00:26:32.764
"the same as you're getting."

530
00:26:32.764 --> 00:26:35.110
I said, "Okay," I did.

531
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:39.410
I received a call from, at that time he was

532
00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:44.262
a senior vice president for Capitol International Airways.

533
00:26:44.262 --> 00:26:47.227
They were based in an old air force base.

534
00:26:47.227 --> 00:26:51.109
Their home office was really at JFK.

535
00:26:52.049 --> 00:26:54.897
That's where most of their aircraft were based out of.

536
00:26:54.897 --> 00:26:56.987
However, they did all their service and maintenance

537
00:26:56.987 --> 00:26:59.194
in Smyrna, Tennessee.

538
00:26:59.194 --> 00:27:02.682
It's a little tiny town just outside of Nashville.

539
00:27:02.682 --> 00:27:06.468
And there's a defunct air force base housed there.

540
00:27:06.468 --> 00:27:11.468
Their operations where they fix their airplanes

541
00:27:12.015 --> 00:27:14.958
and they were flying jumbo jets.

542
00:27:14.958 --> 00:27:19.958
I went in and the guy looked me over and he said,

543
00:27:20.121 --> 00:27:21.561
"What can you do?"

544
00:27:21.561 --> 00:27:24.323
I said, "What do you want me to do?"

545
00:27:24.323 --> 00:27:29.323
And I said, "I've worked as vice president in sales-"

546
00:27:30.637 --> 00:27:32.472
I skipped over-

547
00:27:32.472 --> 00:27:35.353
"Vice president in charge of sales and marketing

548
00:27:35.353 --> 00:27:40.055
"for a medical group, laser systems and electronics."

549
00:27:40.055 --> 00:27:43.842
I said, "I was a regional director,

550
00:27:43.842 --> 00:27:46.502
"sales and marketing director for Codman Shurtleff,

551
00:27:46.502 --> 00:27:47.899
"short-lived."

552
00:27:47.899 --> 00:27:49.755
And I said, "And I worked for the Ampex Corporation."

553
00:27:49.755 --> 00:27:51.611
And he said, "We know all this."

554
00:27:51.611 --> 00:27:53.819
He said, "What can you do for us?"

555
00:27:53.819 --> 00:27:55.344
I said, "I don't really know, I don't know

556
00:27:55.344 --> 00:27:57.669
"what you have to offer.

557
00:27:57.669 --> 00:28:00.389
"Whatever it is, I will do my best."

558
00:28:02.089 --> 00:28:05.391
I said, "What do you do?"

559
00:28:05.391 --> 00:28:09.167
And he told me, I said, "I'd like to do what you do.

560
00:28:09.167 --> 00:28:10.521
"I want your job."

561
00:28:10.521 --> 00:28:11.513
<v ->You said that?</v>

562
00:28:11.513 --> 00:28:12.612
<v ->Yeah.</v>

563
00:28:12.612 --> 00:28:13.700
(interviewer laughs)

564
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:14.809
He did the same thing.

565
00:28:14.809 --> 00:28:16.345
He laughed at me.

566
00:28:16.345 --> 00:28:17.604
<v ->I bet.</v>

567
00:28:17.604 --> 00:28:19.438
<v ->He said, "Well you can sure have it</v>

568
00:28:19.438 --> 00:28:20.643
"because I don't want it."

569
00:28:20.643 --> 00:28:21.550
<v ->Whoa.</v>

570
00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:23.449
<v ->I said, "That's a good thing."</v>

571
00:28:23.449 --> 00:28:25.774
Nevertheless they hired me.

572
00:28:26.864 --> 00:28:31.864
That was my, the first time, we had 26 offices worldwide

573
00:28:32.046 --> 00:28:34.179
and that was the first time that I ever heard

574
00:28:34.179 --> 00:28:36.994
those letters, CIA-

575
00:28:36.994 --> 00:28:38.776
Of course the company's name was CIA.

576
00:28:38.776 --> 00:28:40.269
<v ->Right.</v>

577
00:28:40.269 --> 00:28:43.405
<v ->And it was the largest supplemental in the world</v>

578
00:28:43.405 --> 00:28:46.253
at that time and Jimmy Carter deregulated

579
00:28:46.253 --> 00:28:48.535
the supplemental airlines.

580
00:28:48.535 --> 00:28:49.804
<v ->They collapsed.</v>

581
00:28:49.804 --> 00:28:52.109
<v ->And it collapsed and was sold to the Saudis.</v>

582
00:28:52.109 --> 00:28:53.452
<v ->I remember that, mm-hmm.</v>

583
00:28:56.082 --> 00:28:58.817
<v ->I moved to another carrier in Alaska</v>

584
00:28:58.817 --> 00:29:01.857
run by the acting president of Capitol.

585
00:29:01.857 --> 00:29:04.129
And they brought me up there and I found out

586
00:29:04.129 --> 00:29:07.105
that I was working in another CIA operation.

587
00:29:07.105 --> 00:29:09.536
And I kept hearing, you know, you work for CIA,

588
00:29:09.536 --> 00:29:11.254
you work for the CIA.

589
00:29:11.254 --> 00:29:13.440
And when I got to Alaska, someone told me,

590
00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.392
that I trusted very much, he said,

591
00:29:15.392 --> 00:29:18.357
"You know we are all working for CIA."

592
00:29:18.357 --> 00:29:20.288
I said, "Capitol has nothing to do-"

593
00:29:20.288 --> 00:29:22.282
He said, "Capitol?"

594
00:29:22.282 --> 00:29:24.191
He said, "You really don't know, do you?"

595
00:29:24.191 --> 00:29:25.397
<v ->How old were you by this time?</v>

596
00:29:25.397 --> 00:29:28.725
<v ->I'm ashamed to tell you, I'm very ashamed to tell you.</v>

597
00:29:28.725 --> 00:29:30.474
I was about 31 years old.

598
00:29:30.474 --> 00:29:31.679
<v ->And you still didn't know?</v>

599
00:29:31.679 --> 00:29:32.884
<v ->No, ma'am, I did not.</v>

600
00:29:32.884 --> 00:29:34.026
<v ->Amazing.</v>

601
00:29:34.026 --> 00:29:35.433
<v ->It's that compartmentalized.</v>

602
00:29:35.433 --> 00:29:36.318
<v ->Yes.</v>

603
00:29:36.318 --> 00:29:39.392
<v ->And the fact that I didn't ask questions</v>

604
00:29:39.392 --> 00:29:41.054
was the reason that I rose to the top.

605
00:29:41.054 --> 00:29:42.121
<v ->Right.</v>

606
00:29:42.121 --> 00:29:43.797
<v ->And that was how I was an executive</v>

607
00:29:43.797 --> 00:29:48.190
for most all of my working career, life.

608
00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:52.755
Well, when I found out,

609
00:29:52.755 --> 00:29:55.016
I decided that I didn't want any part of it

610
00:29:55.016 --> 00:29:56.616
and then I found out what they were doing

611
00:29:56.616 --> 00:30:01.299
to the Native Indians, Eskimos up there and importing-

612
00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:04.968
You know during the Indians, when the United States

613
00:30:04.968 --> 00:30:09.778
were taking over the American Native Indians,

614
00:30:09.778 --> 00:30:13.266
they gave them those blankets that were infected with

615
00:30:13.266 --> 00:30:14.652
small pox.

616
00:30:14.652 --> 00:30:18.417
Well, they did something very similar in Alaska.

617
00:30:18.417 --> 00:30:23.417
They introduced drugs and alcohol to

618
00:30:23.942 --> 00:30:27.729
Native Alaskans who are highly allergic to it

619
00:30:27.729 --> 00:30:29.190
and it killed them.

620
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:32.326
And then they told them they couldn't whale hunt anymore,

621
00:30:32.326 --> 00:30:35.622
they moved in Greenpeace and a few other organizations

622
00:30:35.622 --> 00:30:38.619
that would limit their ability to eat

623
00:30:38.619 --> 00:30:40.539
and they couldn't hunt whales anymore.

624
00:30:40.539 --> 00:30:43.046
So we sent them chicken.

625
00:30:43.046 --> 00:30:46.021
Chicken rots in their stomach and they develop

626
00:30:46.021 --> 00:30:50.181
some kind of horrific disease or problem and they die.

627
00:30:50.181 --> 00:30:54.127
So we were killing them with alcohol, chicken, and cocaine.

628
00:30:54.127 --> 00:30:56.421
And when I found this out,

629
00:30:58.301 --> 00:31:00.036
I found it out quite by accident.

630
00:31:00.036 --> 00:31:03.161
I was looking for some records in my boss's cabinet

631
00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:07.204
and I ran across them, some highly classified paperwork.

632
00:31:07.204 --> 00:31:09.849
And when I questioned him about it,

633
00:31:09.849 --> 00:31:11.427
he looked at me and he said,

634
00:31:11.427 --> 00:31:15.523
"Our company, our world, our lives runs on oil."

635
00:31:15.523 --> 00:31:18.169
He said, "That's what they're sitting on."

636
00:31:18.169 --> 00:31:21.208
I said, "Well, why can't we just pay them for it

637
00:31:21.208 --> 00:31:25.059
"with money that doesn't really mean anything anyway?

638
00:31:25.059 --> 00:31:26.850
"Why do we have to kill them?"

639
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:31.850
And he said, "That's not for you or me to determine."

640
00:31:32.098 --> 00:31:35.277
And that's when I said, "I can't take it anymore."

641
00:31:35.277 --> 00:31:38.135
I didn't tell him on the spot, I was too much of a coward.

642
00:31:38.135 --> 00:31:41.645
I just packed up and disappeared and left him a note.

643
00:31:41.645 --> 00:31:44.609
Well, you don't do that.

644
00:31:45.359 --> 00:31:50.353
I wound up with something that,

645
00:31:50.353 --> 00:31:53.061
I wound up wandering around in an avocado grove

646
00:31:53.061 --> 00:31:58.061
in South Florida, naked and with a brain fever.

647
00:32:01.149 --> 00:32:02.522
It was horrible.

648
00:32:04.112 --> 00:32:07.632
I talked with a friend of mine who was still active

649
00:32:07.632 --> 00:32:09.583
in the intelligence community.

650
00:32:09.583 --> 00:32:11.535
He put me in touch with a local doctor.

651
00:32:11.535 --> 00:32:15.321
That local doctor found a Pulitzer Prize,

652
00:32:15.321 --> 00:32:19.406
later Pulitzer Prize winner at Vanderbilt University

653
00:32:19.406 --> 00:32:22.030
in Nashville and here I go back to Nashville again.

654
00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:25.998
And they gave me a series of Interferon shots

655
00:32:25.998 --> 00:32:28.163
and they were quite expensive at that time,

656
00:32:28.163 --> 00:32:29.710
they may still be, I don't know.

657
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:33.101
He told me they were $60,000 I think was the figure

658
00:32:33.101 --> 00:32:35.384
and I took three of them and it cured me.

659
00:32:35.384 --> 00:32:37.162
He said, "But don't ever donate blood

660
00:32:37.162 --> 00:32:38.602
"to anybody."

661
00:32:38.602 --> 00:32:41.995
Well, he said, "Your bloodstream looks like a garbage can."

662
00:32:41.995 --> 00:32:43.807
I said, "Well, am I gonna die from this?"

663
00:32:43.807 --> 00:32:48.032
He says, "No," he said, "But I don't know what it was,

664
00:32:48.032 --> 00:32:51.274
"still don't know what it was and this didn't happen,

665
00:32:51.274 --> 00:32:55.849
"you were never here," he said, "and please, whatever you do

666
00:32:55.849 --> 00:33:00.849
"don't ever, ever, ever do what you did again.

667
00:33:00.915 --> 00:33:02.867
"Whatever it was and I don't want to know."

668
00:33:03.657 --> 00:33:04.908
<v ->You didn't know either.</v>

669
00:33:04.908 --> 00:33:07.297
<v ->I couldn't do it again because you can't quite but once.</v>

670
00:33:07.297 --> 00:33:08.183
<v ->Right.</v>

671
00:33:08.183 --> 00:33:10.924
<v ->And so I quite and I opened up a small antique business</v>

672
00:33:10.924 --> 00:33:12.684
and I was successful.

673
00:33:12.684 --> 00:33:17.003
My name stayed in the papers because I was also

674
00:33:17.003 --> 00:33:21.089
doing some work for the government under

675
00:33:21.089 --> 00:33:24.320
Donna Tuttle, who was Under Secretary of Travel and Tourism

676
00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:27.968
and I was doing marketing campaigns for

677
00:33:27.968 --> 00:33:30.219
the Southeastern part of the United States,

678
00:33:30.219 --> 00:33:34.166
working with various tour attraction places

679
00:33:34.166 --> 00:33:37.557
and companies that provided attractions.

680
00:33:37.557 --> 00:33:39.734
<v ->So you retained some of your contacts?</v>

681
00:33:39.734 --> 00:33:40.832
<v ->Oh yeah I mean.</v>

682
00:33:40.832 --> 00:33:42.410
<v ->Right, and so you were doing fine</v>

683
00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:43.967
in the business community as long as you

684
00:33:43.967 --> 00:33:45.663
kept your nose clean and didn't make waves.

685
00:33:45.663 --> 00:33:47.167
<v ->Yeah, I didn't make any noise, nothing.</v>

686
00:33:47.167 --> 00:33:47.860
<v ->Right.</v>

687
00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:48.959
<v ->I was fine.</v>

688
00:33:48.959 --> 00:33:53.364
And then in 1987 I was approached by

689
00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:58.364
a childhood friend that I'd long since gotten away from.

690
00:33:58.803 --> 00:34:02.793
Matter of fact, I hadn't even seen him since high school.

691
00:34:02.793 --> 00:34:07.038
He said he knew a fellow that had been seeing my name

692
00:34:07.038 --> 00:34:10.270
in the paper and all my success stories with Capitol

693
00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:13.171
and some of the other things I was involved with.

694
00:34:13.171 --> 00:34:16.306
He said, "He's got an idea that you might be interested in.

695
00:34:16.306 --> 00:34:18.633
"He's a country music entertainer."

696
00:34:18.633 --> 00:34:23.633
And I was thinking, I don't like country music for one thing

697
00:34:23.688 --> 00:34:27.196
and I'm thinking oh God, you know, this sounds like

698
00:34:27.196 --> 00:34:29.565
smacks of something I used to have to do

699
00:34:29.565 --> 00:34:31.975
when I'd fake till you make it type thing.

700
00:34:31.975 --> 00:34:35.921
I thought oh Lord, I can't fake liking country music.

701
00:34:35.921 --> 00:34:37.297
And I don't know anything about it anyway.

702
00:34:37.297 --> 00:34:38.716
(interviewer laughs)

703
00:34:38.716 --> 00:34:42.982
But nevertheless I met with this guy and

704
00:34:42.982 --> 00:34:47.982
I found him to be corrupt to say the least.

705
00:34:49.371 --> 00:34:52.155
I found him to be dishonest, potentially,

706
00:34:52.155 --> 00:34:56.101
and most likely a sociopath because I could see that he

707
00:34:56.101 --> 00:34:58.075
believed in his own stuff.

708
00:34:58.075 --> 00:35:01.370
But his idea was wonderful.

709
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:05.135
He wanted to set up a joint venture deal

710
00:35:05.135 --> 00:35:07.643
with People's Republic of China to manufacture

711
00:35:07.643 --> 00:35:12.239
these giant capacitor banks for their mining industry

712
00:35:12.239 --> 00:35:13.913
because they were having to shut it down and

713
00:35:13.913 --> 00:35:15.983
since they'd opened up to the West,

714
00:35:15.983 --> 00:35:17.764
they weren't ready for the energy crisis

715
00:35:17.764 --> 00:35:20.804
that they were enduring so they had to do something

716
00:35:20.804 --> 00:35:24.473
and that was one of the first efforts to show

717
00:35:24.473 --> 00:35:27.566
that here, we're doing something to conserve energy.

718
00:35:27.566 --> 00:35:30.862
So they were gonna use these giant capacitors to help

719
00:35:30.862 --> 00:35:33.486
stop the power factor lows.

720
00:35:33.486 --> 00:35:35.832
These mines and the glass companies and the

721
00:35:35.832 --> 00:35:38.061
steel manufacturing companies were creating

722
00:35:38.061 --> 00:35:40.902
every time they started up or shut down.

723
00:35:42.923 --> 00:35:47.923
I succeeded and I had a Hong Kong business partner

724
00:35:49.014 --> 00:35:53.516
over there who was an arms dealer, a huge arms dealer.

725
00:35:53.516 --> 00:35:55.285
Own shipping lines.

726
00:35:55.285 --> 00:35:57.003
Matter of fact, one of his ships was blown up

727
00:35:57.003 --> 00:36:00.554
while I was with him in Thailand by the Americans.

728
00:36:00.554 --> 00:36:05.554
They were supposedly delivering missiles to Libya.

729
00:36:10.899 --> 00:36:14.079
This guy was a, I know this sounds incredible,

730
00:36:14.079 --> 00:36:16.213
I really liked him.

731
00:36:16.213 --> 00:36:17.535
I had a lot of respect for him.

732
00:36:17.535 --> 00:36:20.095
He was a great businessman, he was a basically very nice guy

733
00:36:20.095 --> 00:36:21.790
I just didn't like what he did for a living.

734
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:23.689
He was extraordinarily successful.

735
00:36:23.689 --> 00:36:25.918
But on the flip side of the coin, I had worked with some

736
00:36:25.918 --> 00:36:28.243
probably the worst people on the planet

737
00:36:28.243 --> 00:36:32.191
and I liked many of them because I overlooked

738
00:36:32.191 --> 00:36:34.952
everything in their lives I didn't want to know,

739
00:36:34.952 --> 00:36:37.341
I overlooked everything in their lives just to see

740
00:36:37.341 --> 00:36:41.128
what they were doing from a scientific standpoint

741
00:36:41.128 --> 00:36:45.683
that would better life on this planet for mankind.

742
00:36:47.633 --> 00:36:49.778
I've never been a fan of the drug companies

743
00:36:49.778 --> 00:36:51.752
and I could see that what they were gonna do

744
00:36:51.752 --> 00:36:53.671
was gonna really put a dent in

745
00:36:53.671 --> 00:36:55.624
the drug companies' pocketbook.

746
00:36:55.624 --> 00:36:59.666
This is going back to the days of the medical stuff.

747
00:36:59.666 --> 00:37:02.310
So I was seeing that what he was doing

748
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:06.097
would help the environment, would help the Chinese,

749
00:37:06.097 --> 00:37:07.601
would help everybody.

750
00:37:07.601 --> 00:37:09.670
I'm not taking into mind and consideration

751
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:12.316
that the Chinese people weren't being paid much.

752
00:37:12.316 --> 00:37:14.662
It wasn't gonna help their way of living,

753
00:37:14.662 --> 00:37:16.849
it was gonna pollute their land, you know.

754
00:37:16.849 --> 00:37:21.510
I wasn't looking far enough, I was only looking right there,

755
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:23.482
just like I always have.

756
00:37:23.482 --> 00:37:26.618
<v ->Kind of simple and altruistic motivation</v>

757
00:37:26.618 --> 00:37:29.178
in certain senses throughout from one gig to the next.

758
00:37:29.178 --> 00:37:31.887
<v ->Very compartmentalized mentality.</v>

759
00:37:31.887 --> 00:37:36.186
And I maintained that compartmentalized mentality

760
00:37:36.186 --> 00:37:39.833
until we actually opened up our plant,

761
00:37:39.833 --> 00:37:42.735
our first plant in the Shenzhen Province

762
00:37:42.735 --> 00:37:45.359
which is in Southern China.

763
00:37:45.359 --> 00:37:47.374
It's the industrial zone.

764
00:37:47.374 --> 00:37:49.817
And at the ribbon cutting ceremony when

765
00:37:49.817 --> 00:37:51.630
the mayor was there and the,

766
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:54.947
actually the Under Secretary for the Chinese

767
00:37:54.947 --> 00:37:56.942
Department of Defense was there.

768
00:37:56.942 --> 00:38:01.942
I mean this was a humongous shindig with probably,

769
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:06.530
probably a thousand people there in attendance.

770
00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:09.230
Big banquet, I mean it was an enormous thing.

771
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:11.383
And the government was actually footing the bill

772
00:38:11.383 --> 00:38:12.567
for the banquet (laughs).

773
00:38:12.567 --> 00:38:14.146
That wasn't coming out of my pocket.

774
00:38:14.146 --> 00:38:17.890
And I was really pleased with it, with the whole thing

775
00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:20.855
and that was at that point when I was brought over,

776
00:38:20.855 --> 00:38:24.322
I was standing there with my interpreter and we were talking

777
00:38:24.322 --> 00:38:28.641
with some dignitaries, I don't recall who they were.

778
00:38:30.321 --> 00:38:32.951
One of them was an engineer I liked very much

779
00:38:32.951 --> 00:38:35.809
and another one was an engineer from somewhere else

780
00:38:35.809 --> 00:38:38.635
and they were gonna be working either with us

781
00:38:38.635 --> 00:38:40.844
or for us, I wasn't sure.

782
00:38:40.844 --> 00:38:44.469
And then all of a sudden, my interpreter,

783
00:38:44.469 --> 00:38:46.667
my Hong Kong business partner who had

784
00:38:46.667 --> 00:38:48.693
become my close friend,

785
00:38:48.693 --> 00:38:50.986
everybody kind of moved away

786
00:38:50.986 --> 00:38:54.005
and this fellow in a suit approached me,

787
00:38:54.005 --> 00:38:55.679
he had a little briefcase,

788
00:38:55.679 --> 00:38:57.930
and he approached me and he said,

789
00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:00.276
in pretty good English he said,

790
00:39:00.276 --> 00:39:02.762
"I'd like to have a word with you, Mr. Phillips.

791
00:39:02.762 --> 00:39:04.265
"I'd like to speak with you privately,"

792
00:39:04.265 --> 00:39:06.196
I think is what he said exactly.

793
00:39:06.196 --> 00:39:10.238
And I told him, "Sure."

794
00:39:10.238 --> 00:39:12.926
And I'm looking around and seeing, everybody is just

795
00:39:12.926 --> 00:39:15.625
walking away from me, oh man, this is a setup.

796
00:39:15.625 --> 00:39:17.129
This is bad.

797
00:39:17.129 --> 00:39:19.667
And I had no clue what was gonna come down.

798
00:39:19.667 --> 00:39:22.056
And we just take a few steps away

799
00:39:22.056 --> 00:39:25.375
and he opens up his briefcase and pulls out this folder

800
00:39:25.375 --> 00:39:28.488
and the first thing he starts showing me is a picture

801
00:39:28.488 --> 00:39:33.384
of Alex Houston having sex with a young boy.

802
00:39:39.924 --> 00:39:41.671
Anybody could make pictures, okay.

803
00:39:41.671 --> 00:39:43.389
Anybody can make pictures.

804
00:39:43.389 --> 00:39:46.172
<v ->Explain who Alex Houston is again for us.</v>

805
00:39:46.172 --> 00:39:48.145
<v ->Alex Houston was my business partner.</v>

806
00:39:48.145 --> 00:39:49.447
<v ->Okay, because you hadn't mentioned his name before.</v>

807
00:39:49.447 --> 00:39:50.887
<v ->I was president of the corporation.</v>

808
00:39:50.887 --> 00:39:52.305
Alex Houston was vice president.

809
00:39:52.305 --> 00:39:56.230
It was his idea, he was the entertainer from Nashville

810
00:39:56.230 --> 00:40:00.891
and he was the one that initiated this whole thing.

811
00:40:00.891 --> 00:40:03.632
But I had all the state department contacts

812
00:40:03.632 --> 00:40:05.371
and I'm the one who set it up.

813
00:40:05.371 --> 00:40:08.560
<v ->So now this man showed you this picture.</v>

814
00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.269
<v ->He showed me the picture and I wasn't impressed.</v>

815
00:40:11.269 --> 00:40:14.406
I said, "Pictures are pictures, you know."

816
00:40:14.406 --> 00:40:16.730
He said, "You don't think this is bad?"

817
00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:19.887
He said, "This is punishable by death in China.

818
00:40:19.887 --> 00:40:22.831
"Your business partner cannot come here."

819
00:40:22.831 --> 00:40:26.831
And then he flipped the next page and I saw some things

820
00:40:26.831 --> 00:40:30.169
looked like bank account transactions

821
00:40:30.169 --> 00:40:35.169
in the Cayman Islands and Switzerland and other countries,

822
00:40:36.206 --> 00:40:37.252
he was flipping through them.

823
00:40:37.252 --> 00:40:41.155
And then he got to where the money shot was.

824
00:40:41.155 --> 00:40:45.146
He showed me my classified files.

825
00:40:45.146 --> 00:40:48.931
The files on me that they'd been maintaining since 1952.

826
00:40:48.931 --> 00:40:52.813
The interviews that were done by the Department of Defense

827
00:40:52.813 --> 00:40:55.021
when I finally got my first clearance

828
00:40:55.021 --> 00:40:58.658
and they were interviewing my neighbors from, as a child,

829
00:40:58.658 --> 00:41:00.034
and my schoolteachers.

830
00:41:00.034 --> 00:41:04.119
And all the stuff was in there and they look like originals.

831
00:41:04.119 --> 00:41:05.069
Not copies.

832
00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:08.578
Because originals have got little colored stamps on them.

833
00:41:08.578 --> 00:41:11.010
Everybody that reads it has to sign off.

834
00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:15.404
All these files were highly classified.

835
00:41:15.404 --> 00:41:18.838
And then he began to show me other things

836
00:41:18.838 --> 00:41:20.556
about Alex Houston.

837
00:41:20.556 --> 00:41:22.134
And then he went into detail, he said,

838
00:41:22.134 --> 00:41:27.134
"Mr. Houston is involved in child and adult prostitution.

839
00:41:27.894 --> 00:41:31.360
"He is involved in child and adult pornography.

840
00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.603
"He is involved in illicit or street drugs,"

841
00:41:34.603 --> 00:41:36.437
or however he termed it.

842
00:41:36.437 --> 00:41:41.429
Importation into the United States and other places.

843
00:41:41.429 --> 00:41:44.405
And he said, "Mr. Houston works for the CIA

844
00:41:44.405 --> 00:41:46.335
"and Mr. Houston has contacts-"

845
00:41:46.335 --> 00:41:50.655
Oh he said, "And this goes all the way to the White House."

846
00:41:50.655 --> 00:41:53.204
He said, "We don't need an international incident.

847
00:41:53.204 --> 00:41:55.945
"We just want a clean joint venture company.

848
00:41:55.945 --> 00:41:58.921
"You are welcome to remain as president.

849
00:41:58.921 --> 00:42:02.004
"You must buy Mr. Houston out and get him

850
00:42:02.004 --> 00:42:03.860
"out of this business."

851
00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.142
Well my first thought was they wanted my stock

852
00:42:06.142 --> 00:42:10.686
because at this point, waiting this late,

853
00:42:10.686 --> 00:42:12.680
the tab was gonna go skyrocketing up

854
00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.568
for what I was gonna have to buy Houston out for

855
00:42:14.568 --> 00:42:16.445
and I just simply wasn't gonna take every dime I had

856
00:42:16.445 --> 00:42:18.557
in the bank, which at that time was a little over

857
00:42:18.557 --> 00:42:23.229
$2 million, and donate it to buying Alex Houston

858
00:42:23.229 --> 00:42:24.851
out of business that I didn't even know

859
00:42:24.851 --> 00:42:26.269
was it going to succeed or not.

860
00:42:26.269 --> 00:42:30.003
I thought oh Lord, they've set me up for sure.

861
00:42:30.003 --> 00:42:31.655
And they said, "Oh and by the way,

862
00:42:31.655 --> 00:42:35.388
"whatever amount of money it takes, we'll foot it

863
00:42:35.388 --> 00:42:38.460
"and we'll have our lawyers meet with you

864
00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:41.916
"and we'll provide you lawyers in Tennessee

865
00:42:41.916 --> 00:42:44.870
"and we'll bring Houston in, get him signed out

866
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:48.934
"of the company, give him his payoff for the company."

867
00:42:48.934 --> 00:42:50.395
I said, "Well, you know, actually," I said,

868
00:42:50.395 --> 00:42:52.828
"I can get Mr. Houston out pretty cheap."

869
00:42:52.828 --> 00:42:56.081
I said, "In our by-laws it says if either one of us

870
00:42:56.081 --> 00:42:57.702
"is stealing from the company it's grounds for

871
00:42:57.702 --> 00:43:02.702
"immediate termination and the value of the stock held

872
00:43:04.485 --> 00:43:06.992
"was gonna be a set value."

873
00:43:06.992 --> 00:43:09.178
Which in this case was $25,000.

874
00:43:09.178 --> 00:43:12.934
So I had caught Alex Houston stealing.

875
00:43:12.934 --> 00:43:17.114
I told you, he would do anything, nothing.

876
00:43:17.114 --> 00:43:19.930
And it was little stuff but he was stealing.

877
00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:21.455
<v ->So it wasn't hard to get that, yeah.</v>

878
00:43:21.455 --> 00:43:23.855
<v ->No, but when I caught him stealing little stuff</v>

879
00:43:23.855 --> 00:43:26.661
and then I listened in on some of his conversations

880
00:43:26.661 --> 00:43:28.676
with some of our distributors and how he was

881
00:43:28.676 --> 00:43:29.957
handling the billing.

882
00:43:29.957 --> 00:43:32.793
Just weasel, a grand here, a grand there, I'm thinking,

883
00:43:32.793 --> 00:43:35.502
"This guy is a sleaze-bag."

884
00:43:36.862 --> 00:43:39.971
But this was before I knew this stuff from the Chinese.

885
00:43:39.971 --> 00:43:40.899
<v ->Right.</v>

886
00:43:40.899 --> 00:43:42.200
<v ->Well the Chinese told me, they said,</v>

887
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.304
"He has a woman, young woman and a child

888
00:43:45.304 --> 00:43:47.309
"in his charge."

889
00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:51.576
And I'm thinking the only woman I've seen was one time

890
00:43:51.576 --> 00:43:56.247
this (laughs) bimbo picked him up at the airport

891
00:43:56.247 --> 00:43:59.213
that looked like a prostitute and

892
00:43:59.213 --> 00:44:02.114
she acted like she didn't have a brain in her head

893
00:44:02.114 --> 00:44:05.837
and she was very, very trashily dressed.

894
00:44:05.837 --> 00:44:07.575
I was not impressed.

895
00:44:07.575 --> 00:44:09.878
Beautiful girl but, my God,

896
00:44:09.878 --> 00:44:12.684
I didn't want anybody to see me there close to him.

897
00:44:12.684 --> 00:44:16.331
She remembers to this day that I literally ran

898
00:44:16.331 --> 00:44:18.347
in front of both of them because I didn't want-

899
00:44:18.347 --> 00:44:21.504
I knew everybody in the city and I certainly didn't want

900
00:44:21.504 --> 00:44:23.456
anybody seeing me with her.

901
00:44:23.456 --> 00:44:28.456
So when I got back, I got them out and

902
00:44:30.048 --> 00:44:31.840
I failed to mention one thing.

903
00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:35.178
He said the words "mind control."

904
00:44:35.178 --> 00:44:39.551
He said this young woman and this child in his charge,

905
00:44:39.551 --> 00:44:43.466
their minds had been manipulated and/or they were

906
00:44:43.466 --> 00:44:45.140
under his control.

907
00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:46.772
Well I knew he was a stage hypnotist

908
00:44:46.772 --> 00:44:48.608
and I knew a little bit about hypnosis

909
00:44:48.608 --> 00:44:50.463
and I knew a little bit about drugs

910
00:44:50.463 --> 00:44:54.334
and when he said CIA, mind control, drugs,

911
00:44:54.334 --> 00:44:57.235
and all this stuff and I'm thinking all these years I worked

912
00:44:57.235 --> 00:44:59.859
for the betterment of mankind and here

913
00:44:59.859 --> 00:45:03.720
somebody's using it for prostituting a woman

914
00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.206
who's been tortured apparently out of her mind

915
00:45:06.206 --> 00:45:08.125
and a little bitty child?

916
00:45:08.125 --> 00:45:10.472
You know, this is what they're doing with the research

917
00:45:10.472 --> 00:45:14.418
that we did in earnest to clean out our mental institutions

918
00:45:14.418 --> 00:45:19.418
and our prisons?

919
00:45:19.549 --> 00:45:21.661
And now we've got more people in prison than ever before

920
00:45:21.661 --> 00:45:23.154
in history?

921
00:45:23.154 --> 00:45:25.106
And our mental institutions overflowed so much that

922
00:45:25.106 --> 00:45:27.730
Reagan turned everybody out

923
00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:29.927
just so they'd die on the streets?

924
00:45:29.927 --> 00:45:33.788
I'm thinking my God, you know, I gotta do something.

925
00:45:33.788 --> 00:45:36.786
So, I contacted some of the psychiatrists

926
00:45:36.786 --> 00:45:40.678
that I'd worked with and they said no,

927
00:45:40.678 --> 00:45:42.235
we can't do anything.

928
00:45:42.235 --> 00:45:43.718
I said, "That's impossible."

929
00:45:43.718 --> 00:45:47.248
And he said, "Our families would be dead in five minutes."

930
00:45:47.248 --> 00:45:49.020
<v ->If you tried to intervene on behalf-</v>

931
00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:50.640
<v ->He said, "You can't do this."</v>

932
00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.891
I said, "Well I'm not in the company anymore."

933
00:45:52.891 --> 00:45:54.428
I said, "I can do anything I want to."

934
00:45:54.428 --> 00:45:56.122
They said, "You can't."

935
00:45:56.122 --> 00:45:57.744
I said, "Yes I can."

936
00:45:57.744 --> 00:46:02.181
So then I inquired as to how I could get them out.

937
00:46:02.181 --> 00:46:03.439
<v ->The woman and child?</v>

938
00:46:03.439 --> 00:46:06.916
<v ->Yeah, I was told who her owner was</v>

939
00:46:06.916 --> 00:46:10.095
and I was told it's Senator Robert C. Byrd

940
00:46:10.095 --> 00:46:12.261
from West Virginia was their owner.

941
00:46:12.261 --> 00:46:17.261
By the way, Robert Byrd was put into office, let's see,

942
00:46:17.902 --> 00:46:21.635
five years before Cathy O'Brien, the young woman,

943
00:46:21.635 --> 00:46:23.289
was even born.

944
00:46:23.289 --> 00:46:24.889
He's still in office.

945
00:46:24.889 --> 00:46:27.886
And, by the way, the Ku Klux Klan put him in office

946
00:46:27.886 --> 00:46:29.816
as a matter of public record.

947
00:46:29.816 --> 00:46:30.831
<v ->Right.</v>

948
00:46:30.831 --> 00:46:35.480
<v ->Well, when I found out how to get them out</v>

949
00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:40.480
I waited until Alex Houston had gone to Boys Town

950
00:46:40.984 --> 00:46:42.626
to entertain himself.

951
00:46:43.974 --> 00:46:48.549
And once I found out about Boys Town and him being there,

952
00:46:48.549 --> 00:46:53.549
I used that opportunity to trigger Cathy O'Brien out.

953
00:46:54.118 --> 00:46:57.487
I had to let the phone ring a number of times.

954
00:46:57.487 --> 00:46:59.877
Hang up, call back, ring a number of times,

955
00:46:59.877 --> 00:47:02.288
hang up, call back, then she would answer.

956
00:47:02.288 --> 00:47:06.543
And I told her exactly where to meet Mark Phillips,

957
00:47:06.543 --> 00:47:07.588
I didn't say me.

958
00:47:07.588 --> 00:47:09.442
<v ->How did you know to do that?</v>

959
00:47:09.442 --> 00:47:13.590
<v ->I knew people who worked in, around,</v>

960
00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:16.055
I mean Cathy O'Brien is not an isolated case

961
00:47:16.055 --> 00:47:18.209
by any stretch of the imagination

962
00:47:18.209 --> 00:47:19.947
and these people are not real creative.

963
00:47:19.947 --> 00:47:22.064
They use the same themes, same programming

964
00:47:22.064 --> 00:47:23.322
over and over again.

965
00:47:23.322 --> 00:47:25.317
So they told me what to ask her

966
00:47:25.317 --> 00:47:27.899
and tell her I was the voice of God.

967
00:47:27.899 --> 00:47:32.899
And I had to go into her house where-

968
00:47:33.999 --> 00:47:38.999
She was, one of her covers was she used

969
00:47:39.556 --> 00:47:42.852
the Christian religion as a cover.

970
00:47:42.852 --> 00:47:44.910
(laughs) It was such a contradiction.

971
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:46.863
Looked like the cheapest prostitute you ever saw

972
00:47:46.863 --> 00:47:49.658
and you know, and this stupid grin on her face all the time

973
00:47:49.658 --> 00:47:52.462
and always talking about Jesus this, Jesus that.

974
00:47:52.462 --> 00:47:55.854
And it was my job to go in and break the spine on her bible

975
00:47:55.854 --> 00:48:00.854
to Psalms 31:31 I think or something, I'm not sure.

976
00:48:03.235 --> 00:48:04.835
<v ->That's what you were instructed to do?</v>

977
00:48:04.835 --> 00:48:05.507
<v ->Yeah.</v>

978
00:48:05.507 --> 00:48:09.314
Because it says when you first open it,

979
00:48:10.884 --> 00:48:13.432
you know the ribbon and I highlighted it,

980
00:48:13.432 --> 00:48:15.683
it says, the first three words or four words,

981
00:48:15.683 --> 00:48:18.135
"Mark, the perfect man." (laughs)

982
00:48:18.135 --> 00:48:19.253
<v ->Okay.</v>

983
00:48:19.253 --> 00:48:21.503
<v ->I mean this is how the CIA works.</v>

984
00:48:21.503 --> 00:48:24.404
<v ->Yeah, I mean in some ways it almost sounds</v>

985
00:48:24.404 --> 00:48:27.349
kind of drama filled and sophomoric but

986
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:30.260
this is serious business, serious business.

987
00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:31.626
<v ->Very serious.</v>

988
00:48:31.626 --> 00:48:34.843
So I met her and I got them out and

989
00:48:34.843 --> 00:48:37.196
without frightening them too much.

990
00:48:37.196 --> 00:48:41.921
I nevertheless let them know they were in safe hands now,

991
00:48:41.921 --> 00:48:44.865
that they were not to have any contact with Alex Houston

992
00:48:44.865 --> 00:48:48.097
or anyone else at that time, that I was

993
00:48:48.097 --> 00:48:51.810
going to take care of them and-

994
00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:53.644
Actually all I was doing was I wanted to get them

995
00:48:53.644 --> 00:48:56.726
out of there before Alex Houston got back.

996
00:48:56.726 --> 00:48:59.488
And believe it or not, the right hand never knew

997
00:48:59.488 --> 00:49:02.304
what the left hand was doing because Alex Houston called me

998
00:49:02.304 --> 00:49:06.112
and he asked me, "Have you seen or heard from Cathy?"

999
00:49:06.112 --> 00:49:08.128
And I said, "Why?"

1000
00:49:08.128 --> 00:49:13.128
And he said, famous line, he said, "She's done left.

1001
00:49:15.348 --> 00:49:19.157
"And stole even my VCR."

1002
00:49:19.157 --> 00:49:21.248
I mean I'm going oh my God, this guy's worried

1003
00:49:21.248 --> 00:49:23.455
about a VCR.

1004
00:49:23.455 --> 00:49:26.494
Well I had no clue of anything.

1005
00:49:26.494 --> 00:49:28.329
She didn't take anything really.

1006
00:49:28.329 --> 00:49:33.329
I had told her to sit down and remember what-

1007
00:49:34.413 --> 00:49:37.214
He had a huge antique safe and I said,

1008
00:49:37.214 --> 00:49:39.208
"I want you to sit down in front of that safe

1009
00:49:39.208 --> 00:49:42.856
"and remember each number that he dialed it to

1010
00:49:42.856 --> 00:49:45.033
"and I want you to do the same thing

1011
00:49:45.033 --> 00:49:46.334
"because I want you to open that safe

1012
00:49:46.334 --> 00:49:48.466
"and take everything out of there."

1013
00:49:48.466 --> 00:49:51.006
Because I thought, I wasn't looking for money,

1014
00:49:51.006 --> 00:49:53.063
what I was looking for were records.

1015
00:49:53.063 --> 00:49:55.688
And she did it and I got the records

1016
00:49:55.688 --> 00:49:58.364
and I took them to friends with US Customs

1017
00:49:58.364 --> 00:50:00.456
and it went all the way to William von Raab

1018
00:50:00.456 --> 00:50:04.071
who, by the way, resigned his position publicly

1019
00:50:04.071 --> 00:50:07.537
when he said, "I can no longer fight my own government

1020
00:50:07.537 --> 00:50:09.852
"in this so-called war on drugs."

1021
00:50:09.852 --> 00:50:13.297
And I had other friends inside of Customs

1022
00:50:13.297 --> 00:50:15.431
that were very helpful.

1023
00:50:15.431 --> 00:50:17.959
US Customs Enforcement, for one.

1024
00:50:17.959 --> 00:50:21.052
I didn't have any friends inside the FBI.

1025
00:50:21.052 --> 00:50:24.923
We never had a lot of respect for them

1026
00:50:24.923 --> 00:50:26.971
for a lot of reasons.

1027
00:50:26.971 --> 00:50:31.291
<v ->So now Cathy is out, she's out of there,</v>

1028
00:50:31.291 --> 00:50:33.233
she and her daughter are out of there or are they in there?

1029
00:50:33.233 --> 00:50:34.767
<v ->(laughs) I don't know what to do with them.</v>

1030
00:50:34.767 --> 00:50:36.186
<v ->Yeah, so you have them,</v>

1031
00:50:36.186 --> 00:50:38.671
you literally have them in your possession.

1032
00:50:38.671 --> 00:50:40.644
<v ->I'm searching the planet to get help</v>

1033
00:50:40.644 --> 00:50:43.894
for this woman and her child.

1034
00:50:43.894 --> 00:50:46.335
<v ->Your plan only extended as far as getting her out.</v>

1035
00:50:46.335 --> 00:50:47.805
You didn't know what you were going to do-

1036
00:50:47.805 --> 00:50:48.787
<v ->I didn't want anything to do with them,</v>

1037
00:50:48.787 --> 00:50:49.969
I didn't even like them.

1038
00:50:49.969 --> 00:50:51.313
All I wanted to do was get them out of there

1039
00:50:51.313 --> 00:50:52.359
and get them some help.

1040
00:50:52.359 --> 00:50:53.895
That's it, the end.

1041
00:50:53.895 --> 00:50:55.357
And I couldn't.

1042
00:50:55.357 --> 00:50:59.089
And it's like getting on the back of a tiger,

1043
00:50:59.089 --> 00:51:00.443
I didn't know what to do.

1044
00:51:00.443 --> 00:51:04.274
And then, I think one of the things that made the decision

1045
00:51:04.274 --> 00:51:09.274
for me that I had no backdoors, no way to run,

1046
00:51:09.287 --> 00:51:13.030
nowhere to hide was when all of a sudden

1047
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:15.557
everything that I had worked for and saved

1048
00:51:15.557 --> 00:51:18.160
and paid taxes on my entire life,

1049
00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:22.502
which was a little $2.2 million plus that I had in the bank

1050
00:51:22.502 --> 00:51:23.919
evaporated.

1051
00:51:23.919 --> 00:51:28.187
And when I hired a lawyer to find out where it was

1052
00:51:28.187 --> 00:51:30.458
they said the FBI had it under investigation

1053
00:51:30.458 --> 00:51:33.274
and it was outside their jurisdiction because it had moved

1054
00:51:33.274 --> 00:51:35.641
into a national security issue.

1055
00:51:35.641 --> 00:51:36.473
<v ->Okay.</v>

1056
00:51:36.473 --> 00:51:40.260
<v ->And I'm going, "What does my money</v>

1057
00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:42.308
"have to do with a national security issue?"

1058
00:51:42.308 --> 00:51:44.739
And then all of a sudden I find out I've got death threats

1059
00:51:44.739 --> 00:51:45.977
being placed against me.

1060
00:51:45.977 --> 00:51:49.240
Well, when the CIA threatens your life,

1061
00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:52.451
you don't have anything to worry about, ever.

1062
00:51:52.451 --> 00:51:55.566
It's when they don't say a word that you're in trouble.

1063
00:51:55.566 --> 00:51:58.605
It's when they don't harrass you or don't do anything.

1064
00:51:58.605 --> 00:52:01.038
You're a dead guy walking because

1065
00:52:01.038 --> 00:52:03.800
that's the shot you never hear.

1066
00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:07.351
All I heard were threats and all these idle things

1067
00:52:07.351 --> 00:52:09.612
and so I had searched the world over,

1068
00:52:09.612 --> 00:52:12.183
literally, trying to get them help and couldn't.

1069
00:52:12.183 --> 00:52:16.780
And I took them to Alaska where I had friends

1070
00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:20.310
and where everybody was photographed going in and going out.

1071
00:52:20.310 --> 00:52:24.002
There's only two ways in, well three.

1072
00:52:25.382 --> 00:52:29.495
We went there and I pulled all the information together

1073
00:52:29.495 --> 00:52:33.227
from Alex Houston's safe and presented it to Customs,

1074
00:52:33.227 --> 00:52:36.576
presented it to other members of federal law enforcement,

1075
00:52:36.576 --> 00:52:39.318
they investigated it, found out it was true.

1076
00:52:39.318 --> 00:52:42.869
Said hey, this is a shadow government thing.

1077
00:52:42.869 --> 00:52:43.978
He said, "You know about this."

1078
00:52:43.978 --> 00:52:45.120
I said, "Yes, I do."

1079
00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.626
<v ->And this was in relationship to Cathy and her daughter?</v>

1080
00:52:47.626 --> 00:52:48.373
<v ->Yes.</v>

1081
00:52:48.373 --> 00:52:48.970
<v ->Okay.</v>

1082
00:52:48.970 --> 00:52:51.946
<v ->In the meantime, the CIA, or I think</v>

1083
00:52:51.946 --> 00:52:53.706
members of the CIA-

1084
00:52:53.706 --> 00:52:57.258
I was given access to some doctors and they

1085
00:52:57.258 --> 00:53:00.276
literally walked me through a process

1086
00:53:00.276 --> 00:53:03.253
by which Cathy O'Brien recovered.

1087
00:53:03.253 --> 00:53:07.198
And during her recovery, it took nine months

1088
00:53:07.198 --> 00:53:10.430
and at the end of nine months, she never changed again.

1089
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:14.398
She's just been a person, her core personality came together

1090
00:53:14.398 --> 00:53:19.037
and her daughter, unfortunately her abuse was different.

1091
00:53:19.037 --> 00:53:21.544
Even though it was less of it,

1092
00:53:21.544 --> 00:53:24.201
her daughter's abuse was different and unfortunately

1093
00:53:24.201 --> 00:53:29.201
her daughter did not respond to a psychological approach.

1094
00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.445
<v ->And now, I mean?</v>

1095
00:53:32.445 --> 00:53:36.945
<v ->Her daughter is in desperate need of recovery.</v>

1096
00:53:36.945 --> 00:53:39.155
Her daughter lives on welfare.

1097
00:53:39.155 --> 00:53:41.660
Her daughter lives in a nearby state.

1098
00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:44.337
She still could die of respiratory arrest

1099
00:53:44.337 --> 00:53:47.473
by being around her mother for extended periods of time.

1100
00:53:47.473 --> 00:53:50.534
There's any number of problems that come up

1101
00:53:50.534 --> 00:53:55.174
because of that programming that has never been broken.

1102
00:53:55.174 --> 00:53:58.331
<v ->But thank God at least you were able to</v>

1103
00:53:58.331 --> 00:54:00.560
find the proper help for Cathy

1104
00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.120
whose story is unbelievable.

1105
00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:05.488
We're hearing parallel stories here.

1106
00:54:05.488 --> 00:54:07.952
We've heard your story about what brought you

1107
00:54:07.952 --> 00:54:11.313
to this junction in your life where you were to meet her

1108
00:54:11.313 --> 00:54:13.935
and I thank you very much for that.

1109
00:54:13.935 --> 00:54:16.186
And then we're going to continue this story

1110
00:54:16.186 --> 00:54:18.565
by talking to Cathy now.

1111
00:54:18.565 --> 00:54:20.100
<v ->Thank you very much for this opportunity.</v>

1112
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:21.441
<v ->Thank you very much.</v>

1113
00:54:22.331 --> 00:54:24.111
From here you'll want to watch the full interview

1114
00:54:24.111 --> 00:54:26.735
with Cathy O'Brien, now Mark's wife.

1115
00:54:26.735 --> 00:54:28.335
This is a very challenging journey

1116
00:54:28.335 --> 00:54:30.030
but one that brings a powerful message

1117
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:31.546
of survival and hope.

1118
00:54:31.546 --> 00:54:33.604
