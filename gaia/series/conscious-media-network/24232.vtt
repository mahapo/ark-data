00:00:00.628 --> 00:00:03.028
<v ->Hollis Polk is an unusual mixture</v>

2
00:00:03.028 --> 00:00:05.928
of left brain practicality, with an advanced degree

3
00:00:05.928 --> 00:00:08.068
in business and economics from Harvard,

4
00:00:08.068 --> 00:00:10.208
and right brain clairvoyance.

5
00:00:10.208 --> 00:00:11.988
She uses the mixture of the two

6
00:00:11.988 --> 00:00:14.268
to assist people to reach their highest goals

7
00:00:14.268 --> 00:00:16.748
as a business and personal consultant.

8
00:00:16.748 --> 00:00:19.408
Being well connected in the world of business trends

9
00:00:19.408 --> 00:00:21.908
at high levels, I thought it might be interesting

10
00:00:21.908 --> 00:00:23.688
to have Hollis take an intuitive look

11
00:00:23.688 --> 00:00:27.368
at world economics to see where we are in the larger picture

12
00:00:27.368 --> 00:00:28.568
and where we're heading.

13
00:00:28.568 --> 00:00:29.708
She's a little camera shy,

14
00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:31.828
but she has some valuable information to share

15
00:00:31.828 --> 00:00:33.388
about our economic future

16
00:00:33.388 --> 00:00:36.858
as it was given to her from her intuitive guides.

00:00:37.288 --> 00:00:41.028 line:15% 
(relaxing music)

18
00:00:41.028 --> 00:00:41.866 line:15% 
<v Regina>Being a person who,</v>

19
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:45.356 line:15% 
you have your Harvard MBA, you're clearly

20
00:00:45.356 --> 00:00:48.504
well endowed in the left side of the brain,

21
00:00:48.504 --> 00:00:50.504
in the analytical and linear part,

22
00:00:50.504 --> 00:00:52.784
an engineer to boot.

23
00:00:52.784 --> 00:00:55.864
So how did you end up going into this

24
00:00:55.864 --> 00:00:58.444
arena where you have such a highly developed

25
00:00:58.444 --> 00:01:01.534
right side of the brain, or intuitive faculty?

26
00:01:01.864 --> 00:01:04.674
<v ->So the short answer is I got sick.</v>

27
00:01:05.644 --> 00:01:10.644
Back in 1982, as a pretty young person,

28
00:01:10.784 --> 00:01:12.464
I came down with what is today called

29
00:01:12.464 --> 00:01:14.584
Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome,

30
00:01:14.584 --> 00:01:16.384
but at the time did not have a name.

31
00:01:16.384 --> 00:01:18.104
I was very lucky.

32
00:01:18.104 --> 00:01:20.384
I got sent immediately to a professor

33
00:01:20.384 --> 00:01:22.504
at UC San Francisco med school

34
00:01:22.504 --> 00:01:26.284
who took a history of me, did all the exams,

35
00:01:26.284 --> 00:01:29.024
and sat me down and said, I got good news,

36
00:01:29.024 --> 00:01:31.664
and I got news, and I got bad news.

37
00:01:31.664 --> 00:01:33.324
So the news is, you really are sick,

38
00:01:33.324 --> 00:01:35.464
you're not making it up.

39
00:01:35.464 --> 00:01:38.184
The good news is it's not going to kill you.

40
00:01:38.184 --> 00:01:40.944
The bad news is we don't know what it is,

41
00:01:40.944 --> 00:01:43.084
and we don't know how to help you,

42
00:01:43.084 --> 00:01:45.914
so go home, do the best you can.

43
00:01:46.364 --> 00:01:49.324
It turned out that the one thing that seemed to help me

44
00:01:49.324 --> 00:01:51.764
was doing psychic readings for people.

45
00:01:51.764 --> 00:01:54.304
Now today, with the benefit of a lot of reading

46
00:01:54.304 --> 00:01:55.744
and hindsight, I think what it was

47
00:01:55.744 --> 00:01:58.364
was that I had to get into a meditative state

48
00:01:58.364 --> 00:02:00.944
and meditation helps all kinds of things,

49
00:02:00.944 --> 00:02:03.364
your immune system, everything from

50
00:02:03.364 --> 00:02:04.804
heart rate and blood pressure,

51
00:02:04.804 --> 00:02:06.454
but anyway...

52
00:02:07.484 --> 00:02:08.502
<v Regina>You say you just started</v>

53
00:02:08.502 --> 00:02:09.582
doing psychic readings.

54
00:02:09.582 --> 00:02:11.102
Did you already have that ability,

55
00:02:11.102 --> 00:02:12.702
and had you already been doing it,

56
00:02:12.702 --> 00:02:17.322
or was it further enhanced by this process

57
00:02:17.322 --> 00:02:18.902
you were going through and healing,

58
00:02:18.902 --> 00:02:21.772
or did it kind of spring up unknown to you?

59
00:02:23.762 --> 00:02:25.882
<v ->I think I had it.</v>

60
00:02:25.882 --> 00:02:29.382
I had had it turned off as a small child by my mother

61
00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:32.262
who it scared very much,

62
00:02:32.262 --> 00:02:34.522
and I went without it for a long time,

63
00:02:34.522 --> 00:02:36.582
which I think is why I needed the certainty

64
00:02:36.582 --> 00:02:38.542
of all the left brain stuff.

65
00:02:38.542 --> 00:02:43.412
Let's be analytical, let's understand things that way.

66
00:02:44.082 --> 00:02:48.322
Through some friends, I got introduced to

67
00:02:49.952 --> 00:02:53.840
channeling, and the Ouija board, and all that stuff,

68
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.430
and it all came back.

69
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.080
And I needed to do it to get healthy,

70
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.300
and I did take classes, that helped.

71
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.360
And then it's just practice like anything else.

72
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.800
The more you do it, the better you get,

73
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.840
and by now, I've done a lot of it.

74
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Regina>Did you also get information</v>

75
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.160
during this process about your own healing?

76
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.640
<v ->Absolutely.
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

77
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.920
<v ->I mean, and there was this straight biological feedback</v>

78
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.080
of I would have a terrible sore throat,

79
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.560
I would be exhausted, I would go into meditation,

80
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.040
or I would do a reading for somebody,

81
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.040
and 20 minutes later, my throat would be better,

82
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.500
my temperature would be normal,

83
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.380
and I would feel like I could go on for

84
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.680
at least another few hours.

85
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.260
And believe me, if you've ever had

86
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.380
mononucleosis or, God forbid, Chronic Fatigue,

87
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.550
a few hours is a big deal.

88
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Regina>Do you know now what it was</v>

89
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.180
that was transpiring during those readings

90
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.310
that lifted your energy?

91
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.110
<v ->I don't know specifically.</v>

92
00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.240
<v Regina>Just running that connection...</v>

93
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.500
<v ->I think, actually, that I got sick</v>

94
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.620
so that I would have the opening,

95
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.130
so that I would do what I am supposed to do here.

96
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.300
<v Regina>That makes sense.</v>

97
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.340
That is actually, in this uncommon world,

98
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.140
a common story.
<v ->It is.</v>

99
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.513
<v Regina>Alright, so you started doing your readings,</v>

100
00:04:14.513 --> 00:04:16.733
and then as time went on, it sounds like

101
00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:18.413
one of the loves you've developed

102
00:04:18.413 --> 00:04:22.533
was to be able to read for, using your economic background,

103
00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:24.893
to read for businesses and see the health,

104
00:04:24.893 --> 00:04:28.393
state of wellness of people's businesses and on.

105
00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:32.433
And you also have looked on a larger scale

106
00:04:32.433 --> 00:04:34.773
into economic systems, which is what we're going

107
00:04:34.773 --> 00:04:36.713
to talk about today.

108
00:04:36.713 --> 00:04:40.473
So, because we're in, it seems

109
00:04:40.473 --> 00:04:43.133
like a pretty interesting time on a lot of levels,

110
00:04:43.133 --> 00:04:48.073
including potentials, economically in the future,

111
00:04:49.713 --> 00:04:51.293
first of all, we want to know,

112
00:04:51.293 --> 00:04:53.593
I asked you these questions on paper a few days ago,

113
00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:55.373
I want the viewers to know this,

114
00:04:55.373 --> 00:04:58.253
so that you could properly go into an altered state

115
00:04:58.253 --> 00:04:59.533
and bring back the answers,

116
00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:00.993
so I'm going to ask you the same questions

117
00:05:00.993 --> 00:05:03.393
because you already have that information.

118
00:05:03.393 --> 00:05:05.493
So we're going to start it with an overview

119
00:05:05.493 --> 00:05:07.873
of the financial times that we're entering right now,

120
00:05:07.873 --> 00:05:10.853
and what came up when that question was asked

121
00:05:10.853 --> 00:05:13.023
to you via your husband?

122
00:05:13.773 --> 00:05:16.283
<v ->Well obviously, interesting times.</v>

123
00:05:16.513 --> 00:05:18.343
Unstable times.

124
00:05:19.393 --> 00:05:21.753
Times when we are all being asked

125
00:05:21.753 --> 00:05:24.933
to bring from within what's important.

126
00:05:24.933 --> 00:05:27.273
Time to connect to other people,

127
00:05:27.273 --> 00:05:30.533
to rely on all the resources that we have.

128
00:05:30.533 --> 00:05:35.533
Our intelligence, our love, any skills that we have.

129
00:05:36.193 --> 00:05:38.043
Time to fall back on those.

130
00:05:38.973 --> 00:05:40.893
<v Regina>And a redistribution</v>

131
00:05:40.893 --> 00:05:44.163
of the flow of finances and wealth?

132
00:05:44.193 --> 00:05:47.176
<v ->Well the guides seem to think that</v>

133
00:05:47.176 --> 00:05:49.076
that will happen.

134
00:05:49.076 --> 00:05:51.316
The question is, does it happen gently

135
00:05:51.316 --> 00:05:55.826
or does it happen through a catastrophe of some sort?

136
00:05:57.136 --> 00:06:01.476
<v Regina>So in that, does that kind of explain</v>

137
00:06:01.476 --> 00:06:05.576
why what you were given was that we need to

138
00:06:05.576 --> 00:06:07.896
start developing, and honoring, and utilizing

139
00:06:07.896 --> 00:06:10.476
all of our talents, skills, abilities,

140
00:06:10.476 --> 00:06:12.516
to open up all our awareness?

141
00:06:12.516 --> 00:06:17.006
How does that feed into what you're talking about?

142
00:06:17.336 --> 00:06:20.456
<v ->When times are uncertain,</v>

143
00:06:20.456 --> 00:06:25.456
when, let's say, a currency is devalued,

144
00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:30.214
or doesn't exist at all,

145
00:06:30.214 --> 00:06:32.134
well what do you have?

146
00:06:32.134 --> 00:06:34.594
You have yourself, your health,

147
00:06:34.594 --> 00:06:37.734
your centeredness, your balance, your grace,

148
00:06:37.734 --> 00:06:41.514
and the physical things and the people around you.

149
00:06:41.514 --> 00:06:42.454
That's what you have.

150
00:06:42.454 --> 00:06:46.474
And you have to learn to do with that.

151
00:06:46.474 --> 00:06:48.874
To make a life from that.

152
00:06:48.874 --> 00:06:53.074
And the way society is structured today is kind of,

153
00:06:54.032 --> 00:06:57.102
he who dies with the most toys wins.

154
00:06:58.272 --> 00:07:01.410
And in the future, it's he who lives the most

155
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.190
satisfying life with the most satisfying connections

156
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.060
wins every day.

157
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.650
<v Regina>And so we're starting to feel the pressure</v>

158
00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.890
right now that things are changing.

159
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.650
And it's catapulting some people onto this path of discovery

160
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.210
other people are going into more fear.

161
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.890
Which brings me to the next question,

162
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.410
which is, what had been the contributing factors

163
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.170
leading up to the situation we're finding ourselves

164
00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.780
entering now?

165
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.310
<v ->Well the two main things, really,</v>

166
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.300
are materialism and greed.

167
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:40.030
We've spent centuries getting away from spiritual values

168
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.810
to emphasize only the material.

169
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.420
And there's been a lot of good in that.

170
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.650
Scientific progress has come from having

171
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.510
material values, and all of our lives have benefited.

172
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.628
It's just that the pendulum has gone too far

173
00:07:54.628 --> 00:07:56.598
in one direction.

174
00:07:56.988 --> 00:07:59.588
That has led to unbridled greed.

175
00:07:59.588 --> 00:08:03.448
I mean, witness 8.8 billion dollars missing in Iraq.

176
00:08:03.448 --> 00:08:05.748
Billion dollars.
<v Regina>Billion, right.</v>

177
00:08:05.748 --> 00:08:09.628
Not an oversight in the books. (laughs)

178
00:08:09.628 --> 00:08:13.078
<v ->Exactly. Billions of dollars.</v>

179
00:08:13.078 --> 00:08:14.548
And what would cause that?

180
00:08:14.588 --> 00:08:16.866
Greed, greed, greed, and greed.

181
00:08:16.953 --> 00:08:20.254
And the attitude that I have mine,

182
00:08:20.254 --> 00:08:23.323
who cares about you?

183
00:08:23.453 --> 00:08:25.684
And that is going to have to change.

184
00:08:26.493 --> 00:08:28.133
It has to be much more about

185
00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:32.463
if none of us is okay, if we're not all okay.

186
00:08:32.873 --> 00:08:35.643
<v Regina>And you see that becoming a prominent feature?</v>

187
00:08:36.073 --> 00:08:37.193
<v ->Yes.</v>

188
00:08:37.193 --> 00:08:39.294
<v Regina>Down the road, then, is it basically</v>

189
00:08:39.294 --> 00:08:42.114
a rising tide floats all ships?

190
00:08:42.114 --> 00:08:43.893
<v ->Yes, and must.</v>

191
00:08:43.893 --> 00:08:45.433
Because think about it.

192
00:08:45.433 --> 00:08:50.433
If most people have no healthcare,

193
00:08:50.833 --> 00:08:55.833
and some wildly, I need the word,

194
00:08:58.793 --> 00:09:02.853
infectious disease comes about,

195
00:09:02.853 --> 00:09:04.793
well the amount of money you have

196
00:09:04.793 --> 00:09:07.234
is not going to help you,

197
00:09:07.234 --> 00:09:09.674
and it's going to become very clear

198
00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:12.773
that we need to take care of everybody,

199
00:09:12.773 --> 00:09:15.343
or everybody is at risk.

200
00:09:16.013 --> 00:09:18.073
<v Regina>That's a very good example.</v>

201
00:09:18.073 --> 00:09:20.494
So the last few years have been,

202
00:09:20.494 --> 00:09:23.694
sort of the glory days.

203
00:09:23.694 --> 00:09:25.914
Some even liken it to the last hoorah

204
00:09:25.914 --> 00:09:28.533
before the downfall of the Roman Empire.

205
00:09:28.533 --> 00:09:33.013
A lot of us have over-borrowed as a culture,

206
00:09:33.013 --> 00:09:35.493
cheap interest rates, etcetera,

207
00:09:35.493 --> 00:09:37.613
and we've gotten ourselves into very large

208
00:09:37.613 --> 00:09:40.373
debt positions as a culture.

209
00:09:40.373 --> 00:09:43.803
How is that going to play itself out?

210
00:09:45.993 --> 00:09:48.053
<v ->It's not good.</v>

211
00:09:49.413 --> 00:09:51.453
Get out of debt as fast as you can.

212
00:09:51.453 --> 00:09:54.193
That's really the message.

213
00:09:54.193 --> 00:09:57.234
Having assets, having a positive net worth,

214
00:09:57.234 --> 00:10:01.153
and having and valuing your own self as an asset,

215
00:10:01.153 --> 00:10:04.393
in your health, and again, your relationships,

216
00:10:04.393 --> 00:10:06.394
your neighborhood.

217
00:10:06.394 --> 00:10:10.093
People need to be taking care of things communally,

218
00:10:10.093 --> 00:10:11.783
as a group.

219
00:10:11.994 --> 00:10:15.294
As a group we can get together and garden,

220
00:10:15.294 --> 00:10:19.014
take care of our elders, take care of our children,

221
00:10:19.014 --> 00:10:22.014
cook, build things that we need,

222
00:10:22.014 --> 00:10:25.443
and we need to get to know our neighbors.

223
00:10:26.293 --> 00:10:28.333
<v Regina>You have some connections,</v>

224
00:10:28.333 --> 00:10:30.073
I'm deviating for a moment,

225
00:10:30.073 --> 00:10:32.813
you have connections in the world of finance,

226
00:10:32.813 --> 00:10:35.533
people who have been bestselling authors in this world,

227
00:10:35.533 --> 00:10:37.433
giving financial advice, etcetera.

228
00:10:37.433 --> 00:10:39.054
You're still in contact with them.

229
00:10:39.054 --> 00:10:40.473
Others who have been in this world

230
00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.254
who are also intuitive.

231
00:10:42.254 --> 00:10:45.024
What is the collective picture you're getting?

232
00:10:45.613 --> 00:10:49.523
<v ->You know, it's really interesting.</v>

233
00:10:49.674 --> 00:10:54.674
The collective picture is one of concern,

234
00:10:54.933 --> 00:10:57.183
but not alarm.

235
00:11:00.223 --> 00:11:01.633
I've asked a number of people

236
00:11:01.633 --> 00:11:03.413
who are quite knowledgeable

237
00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:05.934
what they think will happen, given the concern,

238
00:11:05.934 --> 00:11:08.373
because I personally have thought

239
00:11:08.373 --> 00:11:12.393
that the way out was inflation,

240
00:11:12.393 --> 00:11:16.603
and pretty big inflation.

241
00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:19.133
Which would, to me, mean,

242
00:11:19.133 --> 00:11:22.553
have an asset position, or have a net asset position,

243
00:11:22.553 --> 00:11:24.813
because assets will go up with inflation,

244
00:11:24.813 --> 00:11:28.513
cash is useless, and debt is worth less

245
00:11:28.513 --> 00:11:31.023
because it's denominated in dollars.

246
00:11:31.033 --> 00:11:32.253
<v Regina>So in other words, housing for example.</v>

247
00:11:32.253 --> 00:11:34.014
<v ->Housing is a good investment in that...</v>

248
00:11:34.014 --> 00:11:36.623
<v Regina>Inflationary cycle, yeah.</v>

249
00:11:37.773 --> 00:11:39.934
<v ->But these people who are really knowledgeable</v>

250
00:11:39.934 --> 00:11:42.643
don't see it, so we'll find out.

251
00:11:42.933 --> 00:11:44.263
<v Regina>What do they see?</v>

252
00:11:45.073 --> 00:11:46.543
<v ->They don't know.</v>

253
00:11:46.593 --> 00:11:51.033
All they see is it's questionable.

254
00:11:51.033 --> 00:11:53.353
And I don't know why they're not seeing down the road

255
00:11:53.353 --> 00:11:57.234
to the end game, but they're not.

256
00:11:57.234 --> 00:11:59.773
I mean this is me personally, not my guides,

257
00:11:59.773 --> 00:12:03.613
but I look at the amount of money the United States

258
00:12:03.613 --> 00:12:04.953
has borrowed.

259
00:12:04.953 --> 00:12:06.654
<v Regina>We're up to that magic number now,</v>

260
00:12:06.654 --> 00:12:09.173
that 8.2 trillion dollar limit

261
00:12:09.173 --> 00:12:11.373
where we're supposed to be starting into

262
00:12:11.373 --> 00:12:13.873
economic decline, in essence.

263
00:12:13.873 --> 00:12:15.993
Our credit isn't very good globally.

264
00:12:15.993 --> 00:12:17.873
<v ->But you know what they say?</v>

265
00:12:17.873 --> 00:12:20.433
If you owe the bank a thousand dollars

266
00:12:20.433 --> 00:12:22.373
and you can't pay it, you're in trouble.

267
00:12:22.373 --> 00:12:23.813
But if you owe the bank ten million dollars

268
00:12:23.813 --> 00:12:25.534
or a hundred million dollars and you can't pay it,

269
00:12:25.534 --> 00:12:27.713
they're in trouble.

270
00:12:27.713 --> 00:12:30.834
And I think there's some of that going on,

271
00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:34.973
because if we go under, where's China?

272
00:12:34.973 --> 00:12:38.213
They're growing their economy based on exports

273
00:12:38.213 --> 00:12:40.333
to the United States.

274
00:12:40.333 --> 00:12:44.203
So it actually serves them for some time into the future.

275
00:12:44.214 --> 00:12:46.413
<v Regina>And they hold a fair amount of our notes in debt.</v>

276
00:12:46.413 --> 00:12:48.934
<v ->Absolutely. Same for Saudi Arabia.</v>

277
00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:51.873
They hold our debt, because without our markets,

278
00:12:51.873 --> 00:12:55.294
where would their people be?

279
00:12:55.294 --> 00:12:57.470
It's a worldwide phenomenon.

280
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:59.529
It's not just about America.

281
00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:02.269
And what my guides have said is that,

282
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:04.149
probably within about 25 years,

283
00:13:04.149 --> 00:13:06.429
there will be, in one way or another,

284
00:13:06.429 --> 00:13:11.429
a massive restructuring of all the economies,

285
00:13:12.209 --> 00:13:15.209
going from the wealthiest to the poorest.

286
00:13:15.209 --> 00:13:20.209
That there would be pipelines of underutilized assets.

287
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.949
Now what that means, I don't know specifically.

288
00:13:23.949 --> 00:13:28.949
What comes to mind is the freecycle.org websites.

289
00:13:30.049 --> 00:13:31.470
Do you know about those?

290
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.189
<v Regina>No, I don't, freecycle.org?</v>

291
00:13:33.189 --> 00:13:36.089
<v ->Freecycle, F-R-E-E-C-Y-C-L-E.org.</v>

292
00:13:36.089 --> 00:13:41.089
It was set up originally, I think somewhere in Arizona,

293
00:13:42.219 --> 00:13:45.269
to keep things out of landfills.

294
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:48.289
And you go to this freecycle.org website,

295
00:13:48.289 --> 00:13:51.569
and then you click on your location and find the nearest one

296
00:13:51.569 --> 00:13:55.889
and it's a way for communities to, in effect,

297
00:13:55.889 --> 00:13:56.889
spread the wealth.

298
00:13:56.889 --> 00:13:58.929
If somebody has something they don't need,

299
00:13:58.929 --> 00:14:02.809
they post it on the website as offered.

300
00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:05.919
White dishwasher, and somebody will take it.

301
00:14:06.149 --> 00:14:07.889
<v Regina>So this is between communities,</v>

302
00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:09.070
or within a community?

303
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.889
<v ->It's within a community,</v>

304
00:14:10.889 --> 00:14:13.150
but how do you define the community?

305
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:15.369
So there's one for, say, Citrus Heights,

306
00:14:15.369 --> 00:14:19.329
but then on the peninsula, there's one for about four towns.

307
00:14:19.329 --> 00:14:21.549
And there are, I'm sure, areas of the country

308
00:14:21.549 --> 00:14:22.669
where there isn't one yet,

309
00:14:22.669 --> 00:14:24.429
and it's, I'm sure, quite easy to do it.

310
00:14:24.429 --> 00:14:26.509
They're growing incredibly fast.

311
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:27.969
<v Regina>Freecycle, that's a fabulous idea.</v>

312
00:14:27.969 --> 00:14:29.249
<v ->Freecycle. It's the best.</v>

313
00:14:29.249 --> 00:14:30.729
<v Regina>So it keeps it out of the landfills,</v>

314
00:14:30.729 --> 00:14:34.829
basically keeps resources moving

315
00:14:34.829 --> 00:14:37.290
and being revitalized and valued.

316
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:38.609
<v ->To the people who really need them.</v>

317
00:14:38.609 --> 00:14:40.989
<v Regina>Right, excellent idea.</v>

318
00:14:40.989 --> 00:14:44.829
<v ->So that's one example of pipelines of resources...</v>

319
00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:46.549
<v Regina>Underutilized resources.</v>

320
00:14:46.549 --> 00:14:49.339
What are some other examples of that?

321
00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:53.349
<v ->I'm thinking of Second Harvest,</v>

322
00:14:53.349 --> 00:14:55.589
or the people who glean out in the fields.

323
00:14:55.589 --> 00:14:58.169
<v Regina>Right, Senior Gleaners.</v>

324
00:14:58.169 --> 00:15:01.469
So creating the maximum usage

325
00:15:01.469 --> 00:15:04.309
of all of the Earth's resources.

326
00:15:04.309 --> 00:15:06.949
And what about people resources?

327
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:09.149
<v ->Same thing.</v>

328
00:15:09.839 --> 00:15:12.709
I think the the Gray Panthers around here

329
00:15:12.709 --> 00:15:15.725
does work for people, sometimes for free,

330
00:15:15.725 --> 00:15:17.665
sometimes for pay, depending on whether

331
00:15:17.665 --> 00:15:19.455
you can afford to pay or not.

332
00:15:20.026 --> 00:15:24.365
<v Regina>Right, everywhere from little fix-it jobs to...</v>

333
00:15:24.365 --> 00:15:27.985
<v ->To Christmas in April, or whatever that's called.</v>

334
00:15:27.985 --> 00:15:29.895
It's got a different name now.

335
00:15:33.526 --> 00:15:35.525
<v Regina>Yeah, well I get the drift</v>

336
00:15:35.525 --> 00:15:36.785
of what you're talking about.

337
00:15:36.785 --> 00:15:38.345
<v ->They do major makeovers of properties</v>

338
00:15:38.345 --> 00:15:42.355
for public institutions, or people who can't afford to.

339
00:15:42.585 --> 00:15:46.066
<v Regina>So in essence, if we're going to</v>

340
00:15:46.066 --> 00:15:50.640
insulate ourselves from the huge bumps,

341
00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.381
it seems that it requires a preemptive

342
00:15:53.381 --> 00:15:55.761
shift in consciousness.

343
00:15:55.761 --> 00:15:57.800
And so how do you look at what we can do

344
00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.100
to start structuring that?

345
00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.781
I think you just hit on it a moment ago

346
00:16:00.781 --> 00:16:03.300
with groups like freecycle, services like this,

347
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.560
but beyond that even.

348
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.101
<v ->Well I would say it starts actually in oneself.</v>

349
00:16:09.101 --> 00:16:11.401
It starts in your heart.

350
00:16:11.401 --> 00:16:14.900
Feeling love in your heart, feeling love for another person,

351
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.540
feeling love for a tree, or the sky,

352
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.220
or the air that you breathe.

353
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.720
Blessing every breath that you take

354
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.200
because without it you wouldn't be living.

355
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.640
And the more that you can be in appreciation

356
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.900
and gratitude for life,

357
00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.200
the more that you begin to reach out to other people

358
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.360
and have the bonds that will carry you through,

359
00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.211
will carry all of us through the future.

360
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.336
<v Regina>That's very well spoken.</v>

361
00:16:41.336 --> 00:16:44.916
And also, on a very simple level,

362
00:16:44.916 --> 00:16:48.636
just to be able to see the value in everything around us,

363
00:16:48.636 --> 00:16:50.037
and how it fits into the picture,

364
00:16:50.037 --> 00:16:53.296
and how we need to provide custodianship

365
00:16:53.296 --> 00:16:56.406
for each of these elements of our lives.

366
00:16:56.957 --> 00:16:58.496
<v ->So what my guides said was,</v>

367
00:16:58.496 --> 00:17:03.496
see the universe in a grain of sand and in each other.

368
00:17:04.556 --> 00:17:06.457
The whole concept of Namaste,

369
00:17:06.457 --> 00:17:11.327
I salute the God in you, that's it right there.

370
00:17:11.936 --> 00:17:14.036
And if we would just do that regularly,

371
00:17:14.036 --> 00:17:16.276
our communities would change,

372
00:17:16.276 --> 00:17:18.816
our relationship to the Earth would change.

373
00:17:18.816 --> 00:17:20.597
<v Regina>Doing this with trees, and flowers,</v>

374
00:17:20.597 --> 00:17:23.516
and animals, and insects...

375
00:17:23.516 --> 00:17:25.756
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

376
00:17:25.756 --> 00:17:30.756
<v Regina>So what are the hidden opportunities,</v>

377
00:17:32.256 --> 00:17:36.056
maybe hidden now, but in the future more revealed.

378
00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:38.976
What are the opportunities in seeing a massive

379
00:17:38.976 --> 00:17:42.286
restructuring of the wealth of the planet?

380
00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:45.976
<v ->When you ask it that way,</v>

381
00:17:45.976 --> 00:17:49.406
what comes to me is just peace.

382
00:17:50.176 --> 00:17:52.676
Peace in my heart.

383
00:17:52.676 --> 00:17:56.687
Peace in my home, peace in all the world.

384
00:17:56.876 --> 00:17:58.756
That's really the main thing.

385
00:17:58.756 --> 00:18:01.036
I know when you asked the question originally,

386
00:18:01.036 --> 00:18:02.596
you were asking about investments.

387
00:18:02.596 --> 00:18:04.717
<v Regina>Right, and now I'm broadening it.</v>

388
00:18:04.717 --> 00:18:07.177
<v ->So if I were to answer it that way, I would say,</v>

389
00:18:07.177 --> 00:18:10.177
or my guides said, basically any technology

390
00:18:10.177 --> 00:18:12.536
that enables you to do more with less,

391
00:18:12.536 --> 00:18:17.136
or that enables you to use alternative energy for something,

392
00:18:17.136 --> 00:18:19.587
any of those.

393
00:18:19.716 --> 00:18:23.266
I think that, what I'm getting now, is the problem with that

394
00:18:23.266 --> 00:18:27.951
is that those are not, in many cases, major investments.

395
00:18:27.951 --> 00:18:31.651
You can make a solar oven with some cardboard,

396
00:18:31.651 --> 00:18:35.012
and some tin foil, and a sheet of glass.

397
00:18:35.012 --> 00:18:37.612
Which you can probably get on freecycle.

398
00:18:37.612 --> 00:18:41.212
So it's not, they're not all money making opportunities,

399
00:18:41.212 --> 00:18:43.512
but that doesn't mean they're not opportunities.

400
00:18:43.512 --> 00:18:45.971
<v Regina>Yes, and actually, when I was</v>

401
00:18:45.971 --> 00:18:48.112
constructing that question, it was broad,

402
00:18:48.112 --> 00:18:52.232
and I did mean in terms of the humanity of it,

403
00:18:52.232 --> 00:18:53.752
and not just the investment of it,

404
00:18:53.752 --> 00:18:57.232
so that might be why you got that answer.

405
00:18:57.232 --> 00:19:00.151
Because it seems to me, any time there's stress,

406
00:19:00.151 --> 00:19:01.971
any time there's challenge,

407
00:19:01.971 --> 00:19:04.392
there's always a silver lining to it.

408
00:19:04.392 --> 00:19:06.401
<v ->Always.</v>

409
00:19:06.611 --> 00:19:08.731
<v Regina>And so to you, the silver lining is</v>

410
00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:11.071
the expansion of consciousness and awareness.

411
00:19:11.071 --> 00:19:12.411
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

412
00:19:12.411 --> 00:19:14.812
And because we can actually create a paradise

413
00:19:14.812 --> 00:19:17.671
here on Earth, if we would just focus on our hearts

414
00:19:17.671 --> 00:19:20.751
and listen to our intuitive guidance.

415
00:19:20.751 --> 00:19:25.751
Everybody has it, and if you just hear yours,

416
00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:29.111
then life will get better for you, and your home,

417
00:19:29.111 --> 00:19:31.691
your community, your planet, everything.

418
00:19:31.691 --> 00:19:33.031
<v Regina>And if we stop trying to compete,</v>

419
00:19:33.031 --> 00:19:35.391
and stop trying to win at the expense of

420
00:19:35.391 --> 00:19:39.952
another human being, i.e., he who has the most toys wins,

421
00:19:39.952 --> 00:19:43.391
well that by virtue creates competition,

422
00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:46.012
meaning there's a winner and a loser,

423
00:19:46.012 --> 00:19:49.131
which is the antithesis of peace.

424
00:19:49.131 --> 00:19:50.491
<v ->Exactly.</v>

425
00:19:50.491 --> 00:19:52.651
And so the opportunities going forward

426
00:19:52.651 --> 00:19:57.191
are also about being responsible.

427
00:19:57.191 --> 00:20:00.112
First, completely for yourself, your own integrity,

428
00:20:00.112 --> 00:20:02.911
your actions, keeping your word.

429
00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:05.192
Trust, being able to trust yourself,

430
00:20:05.192 --> 00:20:08.092
finding other people you can trust.

431
00:20:08.092 --> 00:20:11.251
And then, being responsible

432
00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:13.971
for the larger Earth.

433
00:20:13.971 --> 00:20:15.811
Maybe you look at that as your community,

434
00:20:15.811 --> 00:20:18.691
maybe you look at that as the Earth in general,

435
00:20:18.691 --> 00:20:22.052
but that stewardship, that connection

436
00:20:22.052 --> 00:20:26.851
to all that is, is incredibly rewarding.

437
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:30.622
I mean, what better investment could you make, really?

438
00:20:31.071 --> 00:20:33.371
<v Regina>And the timeframe that you're talking about,</v>

439
00:20:33.371 --> 00:20:36.492
again, this is not imminent, although there will be

440
00:20:36.492 --> 00:20:40.192
imminent shifts in economies around the world.

441
00:20:40.192 --> 00:20:42.871
Can you talk about that a little,

442
00:20:42.871 --> 00:20:45.451
and a little more short term view, even,

443
00:20:45.451 --> 00:20:48.291
as to some of the indicators of what may be coming?

444
00:20:48.291 --> 00:20:50.111
And you may not be able to, because like you said,

445
00:20:50.111 --> 00:20:54.151
your hit on it is inflation, where some of your friends

446
00:20:54.151 --> 00:20:56.842
in the field do not get that same hit.

447
00:20:58.191 --> 00:21:00.331
<v ->Well one of the possiblilties</v>

448
00:21:00.331 --> 00:21:04.392
is more and more Earth catastrophes,

449
00:21:04.392 --> 00:21:09.392
and so you can look at the tsunami as one indicator,

450
00:21:11.231 --> 00:21:13.912
you can look at Katrina as another.

451
00:21:13.912 --> 00:21:16.151
To me, that's a really clear one,

452
00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:19.831
because we could have saved each other,

453
00:21:19.831 --> 00:21:21.311
and we didn't.

454
00:21:21.311 --> 00:21:25.891
The tsunami, guess what, there was no time, really.

455
00:21:25.891 --> 00:21:29.271
But we could have saved New Orleans.

456
00:21:29.271 --> 00:21:31.751
We could, if it's appropriate, rebuild New Orleans,

457
00:21:31.751 --> 00:21:33.691
but it isn't happening.

458
00:21:33.691 --> 00:21:37.411
And that's indicator number one.

459
00:21:37.411 --> 00:21:40.651
And that sort of thing, over time,

460
00:21:40.651 --> 00:21:42.992
will happen more and more.

461
00:21:42.992 --> 00:21:47.251
That's one way that it could sort of devolve.

462
00:21:47.251 --> 00:21:51.372
Each one of those massive movements of people

463
00:21:51.372 --> 00:21:53.331
is an opportunity.

464
00:21:53.331 --> 00:21:56.991
It's an opportunity to create new communities.

465
00:21:56.991 --> 00:22:01.991
Take new blood, new energy into your community.

466
00:22:02.011 --> 00:22:04.861
So it can be a really good thing.

467
00:22:06.991 --> 00:22:09.331
<v Regina>So, going back to the line of questioning</v>

468
00:22:09.331 --> 00:22:14.131
I put with you a few days ago to meditate on,

469
00:22:14.131 --> 00:22:17.551
is one of this is how to best structure our lives

470
00:22:17.551 --> 00:22:21.941
then to ride these sorts of events out better.

471
00:22:23.591 --> 00:22:27.972
<v ->Well again, you know,</v>

472
00:22:27.972 --> 00:22:32.972
cultivating self, your home, your neighborhood,

473
00:22:33.331 --> 00:22:36.391
they kept saying over and over, your neighborhood,

474
00:22:36.391 --> 00:22:39.931
your neighbors, and working together

475
00:22:39.931 --> 00:22:41.851
where you already are.

476
00:22:41.851 --> 00:22:43.551
That you've been attracted to where you live

477
00:22:43.551 --> 00:22:45.092
for a reason.

478
00:22:45.092 --> 00:22:47.231
These things are not random.

479
00:22:47.231 --> 00:22:52.231
And using your neighborhood as the place to start.

480
00:22:52.692 --> 00:22:56.281
If there's a change you want to see, start at home.

481
00:22:58.451 --> 00:23:02.051
<v Regina>We've spent the last 50 years</v>

482
00:23:02.051 --> 00:23:04.491
trying to separate from our families.

483
00:23:04.491 --> 00:23:05.951
Trying to go out on our own.

484
00:23:05.951 --> 00:23:08.851
To each man and woman, their own condo

485
00:23:08.851 --> 00:23:10.582
or apartment.

486
00:23:10.631 --> 00:23:12.552
Until you finally get married and maybe you'll share it

487
00:23:12.552 --> 00:23:14.231
with a child or two.

488
00:23:14.231 --> 00:23:17.192
So it's really been much more about separation

489
00:23:17.192 --> 00:23:19.051
in recent decades.

490
00:23:19.051 --> 00:23:21.432
So what we're looking at is going back to

491
00:23:21.432 --> 00:23:23.191
what has historically thrived,

492
00:23:23.191 --> 00:23:28.191
which is extended family, on many levels.

493
00:23:28.291 --> 00:23:29.871
<v ->On many levels.</v>

494
00:23:29.871 --> 00:23:30.931
<v Regina>I don't mean necessarily blood.</v>

495
00:23:30.931 --> 00:23:32.611
<v ->Exactly, yes. I would say extended family,</v>

496
00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:34.751
but not necessarily blood, yes.

497
00:23:34.751 --> 00:23:36.771
That's exactly what I would say.

498
00:23:36.771 --> 00:23:38.411
<v Regina>So it might be that,</v>

499
00:23:38.411 --> 00:23:39.712
if you have a family of four

500
00:23:39.712 --> 00:23:42.072
living in a house with four bedrooms,

501
00:23:42.072 --> 00:23:46.341
maybe you have a sister, or brother-in-law, or friends,

502
00:23:46.341 --> 00:23:49.116
that you might want to consolidate your resources

503
00:23:49.116 --> 00:23:51.596
and perhaps larger groups of people

504
00:23:51.596 --> 00:23:54.716
will be living together in the future again?

505
00:23:54.716 --> 00:23:58.156
<v ->It may be, and there's a whole co-housing movement,</v>

506
00:23:58.156 --> 00:24:00.956
which is having smaller individual units

507
00:24:00.956 --> 00:24:02.816
and more common space.

508
00:24:02.816 --> 00:24:04.596
Some of those things are being built new,

509
00:24:04.596 --> 00:24:07.537
but some of them are just about taking down the fences

510
00:24:07.537 --> 00:24:12.216
between yards and using that as common garden space,

511
00:24:12.216 --> 00:24:17.116
and having communal dinners, and having an actual community,

512
00:24:17.116 --> 00:24:20.607
rather than, you know, I'm in my own little box.

513
00:24:20.897 --> 00:24:24.076
<v Regina>And so there is an upliftment in this sharing.</v>

514
00:24:24.076 --> 00:24:26.776
<v ->Absolutely. Every day is a chance</v>

515
00:24:26.776 --> 00:24:30.597
to connect and give and feel that grace

516
00:24:30.597 --> 00:24:32.847
that comes from giving.

517
00:24:34.456 --> 00:24:37.276
<v Regina>You were saying,</v>

518
00:24:37.276 --> 00:24:39.801
what happened is, I asked you a set of questions,

519
00:24:39.801 --> 00:24:42.062
but then you also had another set of questions

520
00:24:42.062 --> 00:24:47.062
from another person that were very specific,

521
00:24:47.381 --> 00:24:51.612
and I don't know if you want to get into those or not.

522
00:24:51.881 --> 00:24:54.001
<v ->We can try, I mean,</v>

523
00:24:54.001 --> 00:24:55.161
you're gonna edit the tape anyway,

524
00:24:55.161 --> 00:24:56.301
so if nothing happens...

525
00:24:56.301 --> 00:24:57.881
<v Regina>Well usually we don't edit much, actually,</v>

526
00:24:57.881 --> 00:24:59.702
but we can go ahead and go for it here.

527
00:24:59.702 --> 00:25:00.781
<v ->Well let's just see what comes through,</v>

528
00:25:00.781 --> 00:25:02.601
and I'll just ask my guides to tell me

529
00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:04.361
what the answers are.

530
00:25:04.361 --> 00:25:05.911
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

531
00:25:07.481 --> 00:25:10.082
This first question here is the whole subject of

532
00:25:10.082 --> 00:25:13.622
illegal immigrants coming into the country.

533
00:25:13.622 --> 00:25:17.182
Is this something that is good for the country

534
00:25:17.182 --> 00:25:19.603
and beneficial, or is it something that's a drain?

535
00:25:19.603 --> 00:25:21.502
So did you get an answer to that one?

536
00:25:21.502 --> 00:25:23.583
<v ->You know, I didn't, but what I'm getting now</v>

537
00:25:23.583 --> 00:25:25.462
is it's actually a good thing.

538
00:25:25.462 --> 00:25:27.022
<v Regina>That's what I get.</v>

539
00:25:27.022 --> 00:25:32.022
<v ->It's about bringing new life, new perspectives,</v>

540
00:25:32.523 --> 00:25:34.002
new energy.

541
00:25:34.002 --> 00:25:35.223
<v Regina>People who are highly motivated</v>

542
00:25:35.223 --> 00:25:36.482
to be in this new place.

543
00:25:36.482 --> 00:25:39.402
<v ->Right, and again, about sharing.</v>

544
00:25:39.402 --> 00:25:42.782
They are sharing their talents and their energies,

545
00:25:42.782 --> 00:25:46.703
and we need to be open to that and welcome that,

546
00:25:46.703 --> 00:25:50.242
and use it, see it as a gift,

547
00:25:50.242 --> 00:25:54.752
because they are giving us gifts in many ways.

548
00:25:56.583 --> 00:25:57.862
<v Regina>What about this one,</v>

549
00:25:57.862 --> 00:26:01.242
the annual cost for the veterans benefits

550
00:26:01.242 --> 00:26:02.502
due to live out their lives.

551
00:26:02.502 --> 00:26:03.723
Now these are getting kind of...

552
00:26:03.723 --> 00:26:06.762
<v ->Huge, way beyond what we can do</v>

553
00:26:06.762 --> 00:26:09.703
in our current system. Huge.

554
00:26:09.703 --> 00:26:12.302
I mean, that's what I'm hearing.

555
00:26:12.302 --> 00:26:15.202
Beyond what we can imagine,

556
00:26:15.202 --> 00:26:17.823
and those are not just financial costs,

557
00:26:17.823 --> 00:26:20.083
they're the costs in time and energy

558
00:26:20.083 --> 00:26:22.682
of everybody that has to deal with these people

559
00:26:22.682 --> 00:26:25.122
who have come back ruined.

560
00:26:25.122 --> 00:26:26.643
I would say more than wounded.

561
00:26:26.643 --> 00:26:28.502
<v Regina>Ruined.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

562
00:26:28.502 --> 00:26:30.422
Because we are all gonna have to deal with

563
00:26:30.422 --> 00:26:32.382
the crazy person on the street

564
00:26:32.382 --> 00:26:35.082
who lost his mind from, I don't know what

565
00:26:35.082 --> 00:26:36.142
they're calling it today,

566
00:26:36.142 --> 00:26:37.442
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,

567
00:26:37.442 --> 00:26:40.492
but seeing one too many people murdered.

568
00:26:41.142 --> 00:26:42.642
We are all gonna have to deal with that.

569
00:26:42.642 --> 00:26:46.342
It's gonna be on all our doorsteps.

570
00:26:46.342 --> 00:26:48.202
It's a huge cost, and one that nobody

571
00:26:48.202 --> 00:26:51.093
actually wants to acknowledge right now.

572
00:26:54.082 --> 00:26:57.982
And again, it's an opportunity for all of us

573
00:26:57.982 --> 00:27:01.972
to react with love when we see that person.

574
00:27:01.982 --> 00:27:03.482
<v Regina>Well isn't it also an opportunity</v>

575
00:27:03.482 --> 00:27:05.862
to maybe use a little bit of foresight

576
00:27:05.862 --> 00:27:09.582
before we send people into these situations?

577
00:27:09.582 --> 00:27:12.977
What do your guides say about that? (chuckles)

578
00:27:12.977 --> 00:27:15.398
I don't want to get into a big political discussion here.

579
00:27:15.398 --> 00:27:17.337
<v ->What they have told me to do</v>

580
00:27:17.337 --> 00:27:22.238
is a particular meditation to ask for

581
00:27:22.238 --> 00:27:24.617
the hearts and minds of those in power

582
00:27:24.617 --> 00:27:27.157
to be turned toward the good,

583
00:27:27.157 --> 00:27:29.477
or else they need to leave.

584
00:27:29.477 --> 00:27:31.578
They have two options, and that's the meditation

585
00:27:31.578 --> 00:27:32.537
that I've been asked to do.

586
00:27:32.537 --> 00:27:34.397
I've been asked to do it for the White House,

587
00:27:34.397 --> 00:27:36.557
the Congress, and the Supreme Court.

588
00:27:36.557 --> 00:27:41.557
So anybody else who'd like to do that, please.

589
00:27:42.927 --> 00:27:46.803
<v Regina>Well now, those who don't wish to</v>

590
00:27:46.803 --> 00:27:48.683
necessarily become part of the solution

591
00:27:48.683 --> 00:27:51.854
are not going to voluntarily leave.

592
00:27:51.863 --> 00:27:53.883
<v ->Well they're not going to voluntarily leave</v>

593
00:27:53.883 --> 00:27:56.283
in a conscious way,

594
00:27:56.283 --> 00:27:58.723
but that doesn't mean they're not going to leave.

595
00:27:58.723 --> 00:28:02.344
My guides told me that all the people that died on 9/11

596
00:28:02.344 --> 00:28:07.223
were actually martyrs, and they were martyrs for peace.

597
00:28:07.223 --> 00:28:10.563
That was their message, that was their gift.

598
00:28:10.563 --> 00:28:15.563
And other people will die because it's time to go.

599
00:28:17.343 --> 00:28:21.204
That doesn't mean it'll be conscious.

600
00:28:21.204 --> 00:28:23.263
I won't use specific names here,

601
00:28:23.263 --> 00:28:26.913
but I'm sorely tempted, yeah.

602
00:28:27.123 --> 00:28:28.103
<v Regina>Well the universe does have</v>

603
00:28:28.103 --> 00:28:32.663
an interesting way of creating balance and harmony,

604
00:28:32.663 --> 00:28:34.984
in that sense, correct?
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

605
00:28:34.984 --> 00:28:38.223
<v Regina>And this is very desperately needed</v>

606
00:28:38.223 --> 00:28:42.584
at this time, with a lot of loss of life,

607
00:28:42.584 --> 00:28:47.083
a lot of loss of resources, and as you say, globally.

608
00:28:47.083 --> 00:28:49.144
So in all of this, would you say

609
00:28:49.144 --> 00:28:54.144
because, like it or not, we're a global community,

610
00:28:54.484 --> 00:28:57.523
we're already too interdependent at this time,

611
00:28:57.523 --> 00:29:00.163
do you think that that might be the saving grace

612
00:29:00.163 --> 00:29:04.163
in terms of any economic upheaval and turmoil

613
00:29:04.163 --> 00:29:06.683
that might lie ahead?

614
00:29:06.683 --> 00:29:10.123
<v ->If everybody realizes that it is.</v>

615
00:29:10.123 --> 00:29:11.064
I don't know that everybody...

616
00:29:11.064 --> 00:29:12.004
<v Regina>Please explain.</v>

617
00:29:12.004 --> 00:29:17.004
<v ->If you know that you're connected to that person in Alaska</v>

618
00:29:19.103 --> 00:29:21.283
that you're connected to that person in Africa

619
00:29:21.283 --> 00:29:25.473
who's dying of AIDS, then you'll do something.

620
00:29:25.783 --> 00:29:27.523
I don't know what, and that's up to you,

621
00:29:27.523 --> 00:29:30.023
and for each person it'll be different,

622
00:29:30.023 --> 00:29:32.903
but if you know it, if you feel it in your heart,

623
00:29:32.903 --> 00:29:34.063
you'll do something different,

624
00:29:34.063 --> 00:29:36.183
and that is a saving grace.

625
00:29:36.183 --> 00:29:38.803
But there are a lot of people who

626
00:29:38.803 --> 00:29:43.109
for many reasons don't acknowledge it.

627
00:29:43.109 --> 00:29:44.668
Maybe they live in such a small world

628
00:29:44.668 --> 00:29:46.849
that they don't know it,

629
00:29:46.849 --> 00:29:49.909
or if they know it, maybe they choose to ignore it.

630
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:53.168
The kind of materialist worldview is like,

631
00:29:53.168 --> 00:29:57.708
I'm alright Jack, and eh, screw you, basically.

632
00:29:57.708 --> 00:29:59.428
<v Regina>Sorry about that guy down the street.</v>

633
00:29:59.428 --> 00:30:04.428
<v ->Yeah, and as that changes, everything will change.</v>

634
00:30:04.468 --> 00:30:06.468
And it needs to change, because if it doesn't change,

635
00:30:06.468 --> 00:30:07.988
what my guides have said is,

636
00:30:07.988 --> 00:30:10.309
in the second half of the 21st century,

637
00:30:10.309 --> 00:30:14.288
there will be a pretty big die off of humans.

638
00:30:14.288 --> 00:30:16.409
We'll be leaving massively.

639
00:30:16.409 --> 00:30:19.458
Billions of people will die and choose not to come back.

640
00:30:21.059 --> 00:30:24.168
<v Regina>And this is through a variety of means.</v>

641
00:30:24.168 --> 00:30:27.568
<v ->It can be anything, it can be famine, pestilence,</v>

642
00:30:27.568 --> 00:30:31.518
catastrophes, or a combination of the above.

643
00:30:32.128 --> 00:30:33.989
<v Regina>And then just going back to my last question,</v>

644
00:30:33.989 --> 00:30:37.509
on a purely economic level, as you say,

645
00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:41.129
we're all in this together now globally, economically.

646
00:30:41.129 --> 00:30:45.128
How is the European Union and how is this tied in,

647
00:30:45.128 --> 00:30:47.528
and how are they functioning in and of themselves

648
00:30:47.528 --> 00:30:49.448
at this time?

649
00:30:49.448 --> 00:30:50.848
<v ->This is really interesting.</v>

650
00:30:50.848 --> 00:30:52.369
Well what I'm getting is that,

651
00:30:52.369 --> 00:30:54.468
even though it's called the European Union,

652
00:30:54.468 --> 00:30:56.518
it is anything but.

653
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:58.308
They're not functioning as one.

654
00:30:58.308 --> 00:31:02.548
They're trying, but it's not working yet.

655
00:31:02.548 --> 00:31:06.118
The gears are not meshing.

656
00:31:06.168 --> 00:31:08.959
That is both good and bad.

657
00:31:10.379 --> 00:31:11.788
It's bad because it would be better

658
00:31:11.788 --> 00:31:12.906
if everything were in harmony,

659
00:31:12.906 --> 00:31:15.306
but it's good because

660
00:31:15.306 --> 00:31:19.406
it's slowing down the rush to a solution

661
00:31:19.406 --> 00:31:21.566
which might be the wrong solution.

662
00:31:21.566 --> 00:31:24.306
And in taking time for the gears to mesh,

663
00:31:24.306 --> 00:31:28.246
consensus reality will win out.

664
00:31:28.246 --> 00:31:32.367
And the middle way, which is the way that

665
00:31:32.367 --> 00:31:35.567
the largest group of people tend to go,

666
00:31:35.567 --> 00:31:37.306
is usually the best way.

667
00:31:37.306 --> 00:31:40.047
There is, in fact, wisdom in numbers.

668
00:31:41.197 --> 00:31:42.866
I don't know if you have read this,

669
00:31:42.866 --> 00:31:45.546
but there has been some research,

670
00:31:45.546 --> 00:31:48.266
and it started with people guessing

671
00:31:48.266 --> 00:31:50.826
the weight of a cow at a county fair,

672
00:31:50.826 --> 00:31:53.106
where the average of all the guesses

673
00:31:53.106 --> 00:31:56.666
was actually just about right on.

674
00:31:56.666 --> 00:31:58.286
Where any one guess, they could be

675
00:31:58.286 --> 00:32:00.226
hugely high, hugely low.

676
00:32:00.226 --> 00:32:02.526
There is wisdom in numbers.

677
00:32:02.526 --> 00:32:05.666
So if the vast majority of the populous wants one thing,

678
00:32:05.666 --> 00:32:08.726
then that probably is the right thing.

679
00:32:08.726 --> 00:32:13.286
And I hate to get political, but what's been wrong here

680
00:32:13.286 --> 00:32:15.527
is the vast majority wants to go one way,

681
00:32:15.527 --> 00:32:17.406
and the process has been so hijacked

682
00:32:17.406 --> 00:32:18.826
that it isn't going in the direction

683
00:32:18.826 --> 00:32:20.627
of the will of the people.

684
00:32:20.627 --> 00:32:22.526
And that's really the problem.

685
00:32:22.526 --> 00:32:24.436
The problem is not the will of the people.

686
00:32:24.587 --> 00:32:26.066
<v Regina>So the saving grace in all of this</v>

687
00:32:26.066 --> 00:32:30.306
is coming more from an outside global influence,

688
00:32:30.306 --> 00:32:31.347
would you say?

689
00:32:31.347 --> 00:32:33.406
Slowing us down because of the interdependence

690
00:32:33.406 --> 00:32:36.546
of each of these economies now?

691
00:32:36.546 --> 00:32:39.706
<v ->Now that you say it that way, yeah, actually.</v>

692
00:32:39.706 --> 00:32:41.326
<v Regina>That is the saving grace, yeah.</v>

693
00:32:41.326 --> 00:32:45.376
That's kind of emerging as a portrait here.

694
00:32:45.826 --> 00:32:48.166
What other final kinds of observations

695
00:32:48.166 --> 00:32:50.256
and comments do you have?

696
00:32:50.266 --> 00:32:53.027
<v ->Well the one thing I'm hearing to talk about</v>

697
00:32:53.027 --> 00:32:54.406
because we haven't yet, and it was something

698
00:32:54.406 --> 00:32:55.806
that was channeled that's actually really important

699
00:32:55.806 --> 00:32:58.206
is the role of interest in all this.

700
00:32:58.206 --> 00:32:59.706
<v Regina>Interest, you mean as in interest rates?</v>

701
00:32:59.706 --> 00:33:01.086
<v ->Financial interest, yeah, interest rates.</v>

702
00:33:01.086 --> 00:33:03.086
<v Regina>Oh okay, yes, let's talk about that.</v>

703
00:33:03.086 --> 00:33:04.166
<v ->Actually that's one of the main things</v>

704
00:33:04.166 --> 00:33:05.826
that's wrong with society,

705
00:33:05.826 --> 00:33:07.426
because when you think about it,

706
00:33:07.426 --> 00:33:10.376
people talk about interest as the time value of money.

707
00:33:11.066 --> 00:33:14.136
Well that's a made up idea.

708
00:33:15.047 --> 00:33:18.526
And if we didn't have it, there would be less inflation.

709
00:33:18.526 --> 00:33:21.846
It's kind of like interest and inflation go together.

710
00:33:21.846 --> 00:33:24.007
You kind of can't have one without the other.

711
00:33:24.007 --> 00:33:25.667
I mean I suppose you could have inflation without interest,

712
00:33:25.667 --> 00:33:29.206
but interest almost creates the need for inflation.

713
00:33:29.206 --> 00:33:32.146
And if a dollar a year from now is the same

714
00:33:32.146 --> 00:33:35.066
as a dollar today, then interest wouldn't exist.

715
00:33:35.066 --> 00:33:36.566
<v Regina>So what about the notion of</v>

716
00:33:36.566 --> 00:33:39.026
structuring our banking system in a different way,

717
00:33:39.026 --> 00:33:41.386
perhaps decentralizing banking,

718
00:33:41.386 --> 00:33:44.346
and even some interesting concepts around

719
00:33:44.346 --> 00:33:47.506
community banking, starting your own bank

720
00:33:47.506 --> 00:33:48.426
have come up.

721
00:33:48.426 --> 00:33:50.496
What are some of your thoughts?

722
00:33:50.496 --> 00:33:52.686
<v ->One of the most interesting thinkers around this</v>

723
00:33:52.686 --> 00:33:54.906
that I've heard is actually Catherine Austin Fitts,

724
00:33:54.906 --> 00:33:58.487
who suggests get your money out of the money center banks

725
00:33:58.487 --> 00:34:01.706
for quite a number of reasons, and I agree with her.

726
00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:06.706
And one of the ways that I am doing it myself is

727
00:34:08.146 --> 00:34:12.486
have people you know, actual people,

728
00:34:12.486 --> 00:34:14.486
buy your mortgages.

729
00:34:14.486 --> 00:34:17.526
So that every month when you're paying interest,

730
00:34:17.526 --> 00:34:21.726
you're paying a person and not a corporation.

731
00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:24.287
Because you don't know what they're doing with your money,

732
00:34:24.287 --> 00:34:25.946
and you know what your friend is doing with your money,

733
00:34:25.946 --> 00:34:27.646
or your relative.

734
00:34:27.646 --> 00:34:29.026
<v Regina>It makes sense.</v>

735
00:34:29.026 --> 00:34:29.866
<v ->It makes total sense.</v>

736
00:34:29.866 --> 00:34:30.846
<v Regina>And how could this make sense</v>

737
00:34:30.846 --> 00:34:35.846
to have a community mortgage bank?

738
00:34:36.646 --> 00:34:39.406
I mean how would you begin structuring,

739
00:34:39.406 --> 00:34:42.346
anyone from what I understand can basically start a bank.

740
00:34:42.346 --> 00:34:44.546
<v ->Yeah, you need money to lend.</v>

741
00:34:44.546 --> 00:34:45.806
That's all.

742
00:34:45.806 --> 00:34:47.006
<v Regina>As long as you have money,</v>

743
00:34:47.006 --> 00:34:48.226
you can start a bank.

744
00:34:48.226 --> 00:34:50.766
<v ->So you could probably get a bunch of people together,</v>

745
00:34:50.766 --> 00:34:53.106
each of whom had some cash,

746
00:34:53.106 --> 00:34:57.027
and they'd have shares in a mortgage or a pool of mortgages.

747
00:34:57.027 --> 00:34:59.486
And they could sit down once a month

748
00:34:59.486 --> 00:35:01.846
and evaluate the appliacations they had

749
00:35:01.846 --> 00:35:05.106
and pick whatever they had for the money they had.

750
00:35:05.106 --> 00:35:06.826
It would be probably a little more cumbersome

751
00:35:06.826 --> 00:35:09.686
for the borrower than going to a standard bank,

752
00:35:09.686 --> 00:35:12.087
but you know, if you're refinancing,

753
00:35:12.087 --> 00:35:13.806
it might make really good sense.

754
00:35:13.806 --> 00:35:17.467
And think about it, if you're paying your friend

755
00:35:17.467 --> 00:35:20.207
six percent on a mortgage instead of paying a bank,

756
00:35:20.207 --> 00:35:22.146
well that six percent is about three percent more

757
00:35:22.146 --> 00:35:24.787
than they're gonna get on interest in a savings account.

758
00:35:24.787 --> 00:35:25.866
<v Regina>That's true.</v>

759
00:35:25.866 --> 00:35:28.066
<v ->So it's better for them, definitely.</v>

760
00:35:28.066 --> 00:35:29.587
And you're not supporting a system

761
00:35:29.587 --> 00:35:31.907
that you don't necessarily buy into.

762
00:35:31.907 --> 00:35:33.866
<v Regina>So what happens when you're looking at</v>

763
00:35:33.866 --> 00:35:35.567
the borrowing power of a bank,

764
00:35:35.567 --> 00:35:39.066
where they can borrow at a 12 to 1 ratio to their assets.

765
00:35:39.066 --> 00:35:40.967
That system would have to go bye-bye,

766
00:35:40.967 --> 00:35:42.867
and we'd have to have real money, right?

767
00:35:42.867 --> 00:35:45.146
<v ->Right. (laughs)</v>

768
00:35:45.146 --> 00:35:47.426
Real money.

769
00:35:48.946 --> 00:35:51.146
But this is insulating yourself in case

770
00:35:51.146 --> 00:35:53.386
the bigger system breaks down.

771
00:35:53.386 --> 00:35:55.496
It really is.

772
00:35:55.567 --> 00:36:00.466
Because if I owe you for my house,

773
00:36:00.466 --> 00:36:03.386
well I'm gonna pay you, and I don't care

774
00:36:03.386 --> 00:36:05.287
what happens to Citibank.

775
00:36:05.287 --> 00:36:09.537
If they go insolvent, it doesn't matter.

776
00:36:09.546 --> 00:36:12.526
And actually, more importantly for you,

777
00:36:12.526 --> 00:36:15.026
if you pull your money out of Citibank

778
00:36:15.026 --> 00:36:16.767
and put it in my house,

779
00:36:16.767 --> 00:36:19.346
if I don't pay you, you've got a house.

780
00:36:19.346 --> 00:36:21.146
If Citibank goes belly up,

781
00:36:21.146 --> 00:36:22.706
you're in trouble.

782
00:36:22.706 --> 00:36:24.966
<v Regina>What happens?</v>

783
00:36:24.966 --> 00:36:28.166
<v ->Theoretically, our accounts are all insured</v>

784
00:36:28.166 --> 00:36:29.766
up to $100,000.

785
00:36:29.766 --> 00:36:31.326
For each account, there are some complicated rules

786
00:36:31.326 --> 00:36:33.006
around that.

787
00:36:33.006 --> 00:36:34.386
<v Regina>What's the truth of that?</v>

788
00:36:34.386 --> 00:36:36.626
<v ->What is that worth, anyway?</v>

789
00:36:36.626 --> 00:36:39.326
If money goes away, what's that worth?

790
00:36:39.326 --> 00:36:41.466
My house has a worth.

791
00:36:41.466 --> 00:36:44.847
I don't know what, but it's something,

792
00:36:44.847 --> 00:36:46.626
because people always have to have places to live.

793
00:36:46.626 --> 00:36:48.547
<v Regina>So going back again to hard assets.</v>

794
00:36:48.547 --> 00:36:51.716
<v ->Hard assets. People always have to have a place to live.</v>

795
00:36:52.606 --> 00:36:54.406
<v ->As for investments, Hollis says that</v>

796
00:36:54.406 --> 00:36:56.706
investing in any technology that helps us

797
00:36:56.706 --> 00:36:58.306
to do more with less

798
00:36:58.306 --> 00:36:59.726
is a good place to begin.

799
00:36:59.726 --> 00:37:01.826
And as she says, personally, I feel that this

800
00:37:01.826 --> 00:37:03.986
upcoming correction, if you will,

801
00:37:03.986 --> 00:37:06.626
is a golden opportunity for us to begin to foster

802
00:37:06.626 --> 00:37:09.286
more caring and interconnective relationships

803
00:37:09.286 --> 00:37:12.646
with one another, something that has sadly been lost.

804
00:37:12.646 --> 00:37:15.647
In short, less can indeed be more.

805
00:37:15.647 --> 00:37:18.536
Until next time, thanks for watching.

806
00:37:19.066 --> 00:37:23.296
(peaceful piano music)
