(intro music)

2
00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:09.382
<v ->I had the pleasure of meeting up with former</v>

3
00:00:09.382 --> 00:00:12.042
Command Sargent Major Robert Dean, once again.

4
00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:14.502
To get his perspective on the dynamics playing out

5
00:00:14.502 --> 00:00:18.423
between off planet cultures, the US military and ourselves.

6
00:00:18.423 --> 00:00:21.283
In this conversation he speaks of what's really behind

7
00:00:21.283 --> 00:00:23.423
the shut down of the shuttle program.

8
00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:26.853
His life in this strange arena and his hope for Humankind.

9
00:00:30.648 --> 00:00:32.810
So good to sit with you again, Rob.

10
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:33.731
<v ->My pleasure.</v>

11
00:00:33.731 --> 00:00:36.612
<v ->I just love you and I think everybody that watches you,</v>

12
00:00:36.612 --> 00:00:38.052
you sooth the soul.

13
00:00:38.052 --> 00:00:40.572
And yet you've been in a world that has been a very

14
00:00:40.572 --> 00:00:43.594
harsh world, a harsh realities.

15
00:00:43.594 --> 00:00:46.454
You've been privy to things most people would be frightened

16
00:00:46.454 --> 00:00:48.414
to the bones to about

17
00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:51.913
and yet here we sit, in this beautiful place

18
00:00:51.913 --> 00:00:56.074
and you have come through to still find hope

19
00:00:56.074 --> 00:00:59.086
and your heart is still very light.

20
00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:02.319
What is it? What is it with you?

21
00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:04.119
What has been that part of the journey

22
00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.850
to bridge those worlds?

23
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.443
<v ->I wish I had a simple answer for you.</v>

24
00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:10.952
<v ->Give us a complicated one.
<v Robert>I don't. I don't.</v>

25
00:01:10.952 --> 00:01:14.368
<v ->I find myself at this point in my life looking back,</v>

26
00:01:14.368 --> 00:01:17.919
reviewing where I've been, the things I've experienced.

27
00:01:19.398 --> 00:01:23.500
I find that kind of overwhelming sometimes I look back,

28
00:01:24.032 --> 00:01:25.966
Why in the world am I still here?

29
00:01:26.936 --> 00:01:29.096
I'm amazed that I've survived some

30
00:01:29.096 --> 00:01:30.627
of the things that I've been through.

31
00:01:30.978 --> 00:01:32.488
<v ->You've been through wars.</v>

32
00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.719
<v ->We'll I consider three wars, you know?</v>

33
00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.779
Korea, I look at the Cold War as a war

34
00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:43.460
because it wasn't as cold as people think.

35
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.352
We lost a lot of good people during the Cold War

36
00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:50.433
and then Vietnam, Southeast Asia.

37
00:01:51.982 --> 00:01:53.486
I've been to hell and back.

38
00:01:53.486 --> 00:01:54.546
(chuckles)

39
00:01:54.546 --> 00:01:57.766
Like the famous Audie Murphy movie, you know?

40
00:01:57.766 --> 00:01:59.386
And yeah I look back and wonder,

41
00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:01.778
how in the hell have I really survived?

42
00:02:03.407 --> 00:02:05.508
Well the answer simply is this,

43
00:02:05.508 --> 00:02:08.668
that I was finally was able after many years

44
00:02:08.668 --> 00:02:13.307
to reach inside and touch myself, my immortal soul.

45
00:02:13.307 --> 00:02:16.528
Find out who I am, what I am

46
00:02:16.528 --> 00:02:20.328
and I learned over the years that this (mumbles)

47
00:02:20.328 --> 00:02:23.179
on plant Earth is just a brief moment in time.

48
00:02:25.067 --> 00:02:27.068
I've lived many lives,

49
00:02:27.068 --> 00:02:30.219
I've been through a thousand wars

50
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.480
and I've learned a lesson or two along the way.

51
00:02:37.311 --> 00:02:40.050
I may have shared with you before, I went through a series

52
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.462
of past life regression some years ago

53
00:02:43.694 --> 00:02:45.406
and that was an eye opener.

54
00:02:48.247 --> 00:02:52.458
<v ->What was it that really shocked you in that experience</v>

55
00:02:52.458 --> 00:02:53.808
to begin with?

56
00:02:55.195 --> 00:02:58.723
<v ->Well it confirmed suspicions I had most of my life.</v>

57
00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:00.727
<v ->Do you care to share?</v>

58
00:03:00.727 --> 00:03:04.447
<v ->I had found over the years that there were certain places</v>

59
00:03:04.447 --> 00:03:09.116
on the planet that struck me as being familiar.

60
00:03:10.282 --> 00:03:12.783
First time I ever went to London I felt like

61
00:03:12.783 --> 00:03:14.721
I was coming home.

62
00:03:14.721 --> 00:03:16.719
I knew the city.

63
00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:19.199
I knew where everything was, I felt comfortable,

64
00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.479
I'd come home.

65
00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:22.788
Well that was my first visit to London in this life

66
00:03:23.675 --> 00:03:25.555
and I was to find out in a regression

67
00:03:25.555 --> 00:03:30.416
that I had been in London before and lived a life there.

68
00:03:33.836 --> 00:03:37.380
It was a confirmation of suspicions I'd had for many years.

69
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.060
I had this overwhelming interest in ancient Etruria,

70
00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:46.848
the Tuscan's always interested me

71
00:03:46.848 --> 00:03:48.688
and I could never quite figure out,

72
00:03:48.688 --> 00:03:51.948
it wasn't just a curiosity, it was almost,

73
00:03:51.948 --> 00:03:54.477
I was driven to find out,
<v Regina>Like a compulsion.</v>

74
00:03:54.477 --> 00:03:56.360
<v ->Yeah! A compulsion and a,</v>

75
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.100
I'd see Etruscan art and Etruscan artifacts

76
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.230
and I studied and gathered every book

77
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.339
I could find on the Etruscan's.

78
00:04:09.283 --> 00:04:12.534
I was kind of curious, why am I so overwhelmed with that?

79
00:04:12.534 --> 00:04:14.873
And then in the regression period,

80
00:04:14.873 --> 00:04:17.114
when I went through this series.

81
00:04:17.114 --> 00:04:20.294
I found out I had lived a very

82
00:04:20.294 --> 00:04:22.344
exciting life in Etruria.

83
00:04:22.344 --> 00:04:25.404
Around 525 roughly 550 B.C.

84
00:04:25.404 --> 00:04:27.174
<v ->What was your line of work or endeavor?</v>

85
00:04:27.174 --> 00:04:29.423
<v ->I was a lucomone.</v>

86
00:04:30.163 --> 00:04:31.704
<v ->I don't know this work.
<v Robert>I was a,</v>

87
00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:33.304
reader of signs,

88
00:04:33.304 --> 00:04:35.654
I was a, sorta a priest.

89
00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:42.040
lucomone in ancient Etruria was something like a priest.

90
00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.760
He was regarded almost like royalty

91
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.450
and a,

92
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.662
<v ->Well and that really does speak to your countenance,</v>

93
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:55.202
in this lifetime as well

94
00:04:56.492 --> 00:05:00.341
and yet, I get that you probably been a warrior.

95
00:05:01.032 --> 00:05:02.803
<v ->Into several lives, yeah.</v>

96
00:05:03.853 --> 00:05:06.032
We discovered in the regressions,

97
00:05:06.032 --> 00:05:07.684
well I went through a whole series of them.

98
00:05:08.336 --> 00:05:10.366
That I had been a Knights Templar.

99
00:05:10.976 --> 00:05:12.684
<v ->I could see that.
<v Robert>I died in the late</v>

100
00:05:12.684 --> 00:05:14.223
1187.

101
00:05:15.008 --> 00:05:17.888
In a terrible battle at a place they referred

102
00:05:17.888 --> 00:05:20.468
to as the Horns of Hattin.

103
00:05:20.468 --> 00:05:22.848
Where Selahedine,

104
00:05:22.848 --> 00:05:26.998
your probably from your history know him Saladin.

105
00:05:28.447 --> 00:05:30.557
He was a Kurd.

106
00:05:30.557 --> 00:05:33.757
He was probably the finest general the Muslim army's had

107
00:05:33.757 --> 00:05:35.497
in those days

108
00:05:35.497 --> 00:05:38.537
and he defeated the Christian army's at 1187

109
00:05:38.537 --> 00:05:42.579
at a spot called the Horns of Hattin.

110
00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:45.469
Which is not too far, just a few miles from,

111
00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:50.169
the Lake of Galilee, in norther Israel.

112
00:05:53.403 --> 00:05:55.263
I'd always had a interested in that

113
00:05:55.263 --> 00:05:57.154
particular period of time.

114
00:05:58.244 --> 00:06:00.774
When I was in Germany I was compelled

115
00:06:01.645 --> 00:06:03.925
to build a ancient weapons collection.

116
00:06:05.045 --> 00:06:08.165
Oh I was driven and I spent money I shouldn't have spent,

117
00:06:08.165 --> 00:06:12.476
buying authentic ancient broadswords,

118
00:06:12.476 --> 00:06:13.977
pikes and spears

119
00:06:13.977 --> 00:06:15.157
and such things.

120
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.101
Drove my first wife crazy literally, you know?

121
00:06:18.101 --> 00:06:21.782
I was in Germany for over five years

122
00:06:21.782 --> 00:06:25.155
and I built this collection of ancient medieval weapons

123
00:06:26.325 --> 00:06:28.726
and that was strange and I thought that,

124
00:06:28.726 --> 00:06:31.746
this was long before my regression series.

125
00:06:31.746 --> 00:06:35.177
Why am I doing this? Why am I compelled?

126
00:06:35.177 --> 00:06:38.540
I'd got to an antique store and I would find an authentic

127
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.183
broadsword from the 10th, 12th century.

128
00:06:42.183 --> 00:06:43.566
I had to have it

129
00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:46.451
<v ->That's your sign.
<v Robert>I fount out,</v>

130
00:06:46.451 --> 00:06:47.813
in the regressions why

131
00:06:47.813 --> 00:06:49.797
I was doing this sort of thing.

132
00:06:49.797 --> 00:06:50.678
<v ->Yeah.</v>

133
00:06:50.678 --> 00:06:54.258
<v ->I'd lived that life, I had carried those weapons, you see.</v>

134
00:06:54.258 --> 00:06:55.809
I'd been a warrior

135
00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.502
and it past life regression,

136
00:07:01.182 --> 00:07:02.581
I will tell you honestly,

137
00:07:02.581 --> 00:07:04.432
I don't know if you've ever experienced this.

138
00:07:04.432 --> 00:07:05.682
<v ->I have done many.</v>

139
00:07:05.682 --> 00:07:08.242
<v ->Well it's a double edge sword, honey</v>

140
00:07:08.242 --> 00:07:10.362
because when I first got into it,

141
00:07:10.362 --> 00:07:14.591
I had no idea what I was really getting involved with.

142
00:07:16.245 --> 00:07:18.265
Well as I went through this whole series

143
00:07:18.265 --> 00:07:21.594
and I go into detail, I found many lives.

144
00:07:22.966 --> 00:07:27.215
I had been a High Priest in Ur in about 3000 B.C.

145
00:07:27.866 --> 00:07:30.635
That's where I met my present wife, first time.

146
00:07:31.567 --> 00:07:35.177
<v ->In Ur and look what's happened to Ur. Goodness.</v>

147
00:07:35.177 --> 00:07:37.128
<v ->Ur of the Chaldees they used to refer</v>

148
00:07:37.128 --> 00:07:38.918
to it's in Mesopotamian.

149
00:07:38.918 --> 00:07:40.197
It's in modern Iraq.

150
00:07:41.317 --> 00:07:44.976
<v ->It's an ancient rune now and there's a ruin of a,</v>

151
00:07:44.976 --> 00:07:47.634
<v ->They built a huge military installation around it</v>

152
00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:48.914
and quarantined it off.

153
00:07:48.914 --> 00:07:50.474
<v ->Oh it was one of the major cities</v>

154
00:07:50.474 --> 00:07:52.573
during the Sumerian period.

155
00:07:52.573 --> 00:07:53.357
<v ->Oh yes.</v>

156
00:07:53.357 --> 00:07:54.636
Terrible what happened.
<v Robert>It was established</v>

157
00:07:54.636 --> 00:07:55.958
by the Anarky.

158
00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.180
<v ->There you go.</v>

159
00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.400
<v ->It was Abraham's home,</v>

160
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.000
now you know who I refer to as Abraham?

161
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.921
<v ->Yes I do.</v>

162
00:08:02.921 --> 00:08:05.246
<v ->Abraham, that's where he came from.</v>

163
00:08:06.316 --> 00:08:08.845
I was there, lived a full life.

164
00:08:10.395 --> 00:08:13.165
Vividly remember my death in that life.

165
00:08:13.796 --> 00:08:15.516
You see, you've experienced this

166
00:08:15.516 --> 00:08:17.215
so you know what I'm talking about,

167
00:08:17.215 --> 00:08:20.286
you don't simply remember you literally relive.

168
00:08:21.395 --> 00:08:24.557
<v ->You relived and the interesting thing I found about it is,</v>

169
00:08:24.557 --> 00:08:28.198
people have, if they haven't done this journey,

170
00:08:28.198 --> 00:08:30.818
have a misconception that when you go back

171
00:08:30.818 --> 00:08:33.737
you suddenly know everything about that time.

172
00:08:33.737 --> 00:08:35.117
You only know what you knew

173
00:08:35.117 --> 00:08:37.188
because you're going back and reliving.

174
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.561
You have no more knowledge or access to knowledge

175
00:08:40.561 --> 00:08:42.340
than you did in that moment.

176
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.242
Which is fascinating cause you're still bring through

177
00:08:44.242 --> 00:08:45.872
your perspective of that time.

178
00:08:46.882 --> 00:08:49.924
<v ->Well you're a really wise young women, you're really a,</v>

179
00:08:49.924 --> 00:08:51.544
you've learned a few lessons along the way.

180
00:08:51.544 --> 00:08:53.924
<v ->I've been dabbling in that for a long time,</v>

181
00:08:53.924 --> 00:08:55.424
I find it fascinating.

182
00:08:55.424 --> 00:08:57.165
<v ->That's why I feel comfortable with you.</v>

183
00:08:57.165 --> 00:08:58.164
<v ->Possibly, yes.</v>

184
00:08:58.164 --> 00:08:59.363
<v ->You're an old soul.</v>

185
00:08:59.363 --> 00:09:01.334
<v ->Yes, yes I'm an old soul.</v>

186
00:09:01.334 --> 00:09:04.986
and so what's interesting to me, about you and what you said

187
00:09:04.986 --> 00:09:08.867
is perfectly consistent with the nature of my desire

188
00:09:08.867 --> 00:09:10.846
to have this conversation with you.

189
00:09:10.846 --> 00:09:13.267
Is these, you keep bring up, you have the warrior

190
00:09:13.267 --> 00:09:15.247
and the priest. The warrior and the Priest.

191
00:09:15.247 --> 00:09:18.298
You have this great spiritual wisdom

192
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.233
and at the same time this power of the warrior

193
00:09:24.653 --> 00:09:28.245
and it seems like in the last few years

194
00:09:28.245 --> 00:09:30.758
you've been called upon from within,

195
00:09:31.727 --> 00:09:34.418
to really merge those aspects of yourself.

196
00:09:38.848 --> 00:09:41.560
<v ->Well I've been on a journey of revelation literally.</v>

197
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.502
Come to terms with who am I? What am I?

198
00:09:47.113 --> 00:09:50.093
Why the hell am I here? What am I doing here,

199
00:09:50.093 --> 00:09:52.923
at this particular time and this particular place.

200
00:09:53.712 --> 00:09:55.075
How did I get involved with what I've

201
00:09:55.075 --> 00:09:57.146
been doing in the last 20 years?

202
00:09:58.455 --> 00:10:01.098
And I looked back for a while and I thought,

203
00:10:01.098 --> 00:10:02.557
"this is strange."

204
00:10:02.557 --> 00:10:06.537
Why do I feel compelled to do what I'm doing now?

205
00:10:08.848 --> 00:10:11.081
And then I found out that I was

206
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:14.180
apparently on a mission of some kind.

207
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.131
We were discussing the past lives

208
00:10:19.131 --> 00:10:21.370
and I needed to tell you that

209
00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.140
I had to end the whole series

210
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.213
and I had to end the sessions

211
00:10:25.213 --> 00:10:27.292
because I discovered a life I was

212
00:10:27.292 --> 00:10:29.883
totally unprepared to discover.

213
00:10:31.281 --> 00:10:34.892
I found out that I lived in Galilee 2000 years ago

214
00:10:36.543 --> 00:10:38.962
and I had become a good friend of a Jewish rabbi

215
00:10:38.962 --> 00:10:40.652
by the name of Yeshua

216
00:10:41.963 --> 00:10:43.562
and when that began to come out

217
00:10:43.562 --> 00:10:47.383
and this emotional experience what I went through

218
00:10:47.383 --> 00:10:49.783
and it was literally overwhelming.

219
00:10:49.783 --> 00:10:51.913
I was totally unprepared for it.

220
00:10:52.963 --> 00:10:55.555
There had always been that nagging suspicion in me,

221
00:10:56.224 --> 00:10:57.765
<v ->That you'd been there in these times.</v>

222
00:10:57.765 --> 00:11:00.985
<v ->That I'd been there and I'd done that and I knew him.</v>

223
00:11:00.985 --> 00:11:03.888
But I didn't realize the impact of it

224
00:11:03.888 --> 00:11:07.607
because in the regression it'd come pouring out of me

225
00:11:07.607 --> 00:11:09.660
in a level of emotion.

226
00:11:10.151 --> 00:11:11.892
It literally was overwhelming.

227
00:11:11.892 --> 00:11:13.972
<v ->And it had to have been because those were</v>

228
00:11:13.972 --> 00:11:16.823
the emotions experienced in the day.

229
00:11:16.823 --> 00:11:20.024
<v ->I lived them, I experienced them. It was my life.</v>

230
00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:24.286
And I learned that not only were he and I good friends

231
00:11:25.595 --> 00:11:28.125
but I followed him for 10 years

232
00:11:30.015 --> 00:11:31.926
and I learned some things that

233
00:11:33.197 --> 00:11:35.236
my Christian fundamentalist friends

234
00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:37.446
simply are refusing to accept.

235
00:11:37.446 --> 00:11:41.388
I learned things about the reality of that period and time.

236
00:11:42.019 --> 00:11:44.938
That the church will never talk about.

237
00:11:44.938 --> 00:11:46.242
<v ->Do you care to share?</v>

238
00:11:46.242 --> 00:11:49.902
<v ->Well to give you small example, you know,</v>

239
00:11:51.202 --> 00:11:52.553
the church?

240
00:11:52.553 --> 00:11:55.823
The Catholic church, the Christian church,

241
00:11:55.823 --> 00:11:57.703
Whatever you wanna describe it.

242
00:11:58.892 --> 00:12:02.844
They have this illusion, I don't know where they got this,

243
00:12:03.535 --> 00:12:06.353
cock and bull story they try to tell to people.

244
00:12:06.353 --> 00:12:10.054
About he was a poor peasant, carpenter,

245
00:12:10.054 --> 00:12:11.954
the son of a carpenter.

246
00:12:11.954 --> 00:12:14.096
All that Yaky yak yak stuff.

247
00:12:14.096 --> 00:12:16.239
Well that is totally untrue.

248
00:12:16.239 --> 00:12:18.681
He was born into a wealthy family,

249
00:12:18.681 --> 00:12:20.871
a powerful family at the time.

250
00:12:22.802 --> 00:12:26.871
The man Yeshua, which the Christian's call Jesus, was a,

251
00:12:27.922 --> 00:12:29.523
probably at that particular time.

252
00:12:29.523 --> 00:12:31.962
Was probably the most intellectual and the most well

253
00:12:31.962 --> 00:12:36.172
educated person in the Mediterranean world at that time.

254
00:12:37.063 --> 00:12:39.923
His education had been unbelievable.

255
00:12:39.923 --> 00:12:42.103
He'd traveled expensively.

256
00:12:42.103 --> 00:12:44.143
As I said he came from a wealthy family,

257
00:12:44.143 --> 00:12:48.043
he had an uncle who was involved in the tin trade.

258
00:12:48.043 --> 00:12:50.963
Who had a contract with the Romans

259
00:12:50.963 --> 00:12:52.714
and they made (mumbles) money.

260
00:12:53.164 --> 00:12:56.405
<v ->Now you saw this first hand, however, I need to say here</v>

261
00:12:56.405 --> 00:13:00.065
that the work of Lawrence Gardner and others have gone back

262
00:13:00.065 --> 00:13:01.745
have documented a lot of that.

263
00:13:01.745 --> 00:13:03.607
<v ->Lawrence Gardner has told the truth.</v>

264
00:13:03.607 --> 00:13:06.028
<v ->Yes I very much admire his work</v>

265
00:13:06.028 --> 00:13:07.668
<v ->I have every book he ever wrote.</v>

266
00:13:10.316 --> 00:13:12.896
His work would certain justify

267
00:13:12.896 --> 00:13:15.056
or it would validate what you're saying.

268
00:13:15.056 --> 00:13:17.457
<v ->Well you see I never had a chance to sit down</v>

269
00:13:17.457 --> 00:13:19.017
and discuss this with Lawrence.

270
00:13:19.017 --> 00:13:20.018
<v ->I see.</v>

271
00:13:20.018 --> 00:13:22.877
<v ->Because I know he was remembering memories</v>

272
00:13:22.877 --> 00:13:24.647
of another life himself.

273
00:13:25.677 --> 00:13:29.058
Which lead him into the path that he followed in his life.

274
00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:31.379
Oh he's on of the great scholars of our time.

275
00:13:31.379 --> 00:13:32.808
<v ->Yes he was.</v>

276
00:13:34.528 --> 00:13:38.403
<v ->Now my life with Yushua was literally overwhelming.</v>

277
00:13:38.403 --> 00:13:40.023
I found out that I had been a

278
00:13:40.023 --> 00:13:43.177
Greek businessman at that time.

279
00:13:44.127 --> 00:13:46.479
I came from a rather wealthy family

280
00:13:47.309 --> 00:13:49.209
and I came from a family

281
00:13:49.209 --> 00:13:52.439
of successful businessmen and scholars.

282
00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:54.929
And I was attracted to him

283
00:13:54.929 --> 00:13:56.661
because of the things he was saying

284
00:13:57.792 --> 00:14:00.084
and I had been raised in the Greek tradition

285
00:14:01.673 --> 00:14:02.953
and I felt some of the things

286
00:14:02.953 --> 00:14:05.736
he said rang a bell and made sense.

287
00:14:07.015 --> 00:14:08.976
And so I kind of attacked myself to him

288
00:14:08.976 --> 00:14:10.646
and followed him for 10 years.

289
00:14:13.246 --> 00:14:15.608
<v ->And why did that frighten you, or not frighten you</v>

290
00:14:15.608 --> 00:14:17.678
but overwhelm you enough that,

291
00:14:17.678 --> 00:14:20.239
is it that you had seen all you needed to see?

292
00:14:20.239 --> 00:14:22.058
Or it was so emotionally overpowering

293
00:14:22.058 --> 00:14:25.243
that you did not want to continue on this path?

294
00:14:25.243 --> 00:14:28.956
<v ->I was not only a companion of his,</v>

295
00:14:30.447 --> 00:14:34.647
we were good friends, I say to people he was my best friend

296
00:14:34.647 --> 00:14:36.596
and he still is my best friend.

297
00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:38.186
<v ->That's wonderful.</v>

298
00:14:38.186 --> 00:14:42.537
<v ->But I was present at the trial,</v>

299
00:14:44.006 --> 00:14:45.956
I was present at the crucifixion.

300
00:14:47.866 --> 00:14:50.276
I was present at the resurrection

301
00:14:51.286 --> 00:14:53.555
and I was present at the ascension.

302
00:14:55.347 --> 00:14:59.297
And let me tell you, the emotion impact of those memories,

303
00:15:00.847 --> 00:15:05.057
when they began flooding deep up out of your inner soul.

304
00:15:06.466 --> 00:15:08.456
Literally overwhelms you

305
00:15:09.526 --> 00:15:12.106
and for many years I could not even discuss it

306
00:15:12.106 --> 00:15:14.036
without breaking down into tears

307
00:15:14.826 --> 00:15:16.535
and sobbing like a baby.

308
00:15:18.438 --> 00:15:21.357
It still touches me and as you have learned

309
00:15:21.357 --> 00:15:23.098
from your own experience,

310
00:15:23.098 --> 00:15:25.117
you don't just remember you relive.

311
00:15:25.117 --> 00:15:26.247
<v ->Yes.</v>

312
00:15:26.247 --> 00:15:28.127
<v ->And the emotion is in there</v>

313
00:15:28.127 --> 00:15:31.757
and of course a lot of my modern scientific friends,

314
00:15:32.962 --> 00:15:35.052
poo poo, you know? Poppycock.

315
00:15:35.052 --> 00:15:37.164
They can't accept that sort of thing.

316
00:15:37.164 --> 00:15:39.831
Because here you are, your born, you live, you die

317
00:15:39.831 --> 00:15:41.995
and that's the end of it, you see

318
00:15:41.995 --> 00:15:43.966
and they say if you have the memories

319
00:15:43.966 --> 00:15:45.622
were are they coming from?

320
00:15:46.492 --> 00:15:50.639
And I try to say "I don't know how to talk to you about that

321
00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:53.900
"because you don't believe in the reality of the human soul"

322
00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.938
And they don't, the modern materialist minded people

323
00:15:57.938 --> 00:16:02.043
simply can not accept that the human being has a soul.

324
00:16:02.043 --> 00:16:06.612
An immortal component that is eternal and infinite

325
00:16:07.834 --> 00:16:11.860
and I say "Look, this is a temporary container

326
00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:14.239
"that we're living in and we're using it."

327
00:16:14.874 --> 00:16:17.687
Now the body dies, the brain dies

328
00:16:17.687 --> 00:16:19.676
but that's not the end of a life.

329
00:16:21.357 --> 00:16:25.163
The memory and the emotion is in the soul.

330
00:16:25.163 --> 00:16:27.530
<v ->Absolutely and it stays with it.</v>

331
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:28.447
<v ->Forever.</v>

332
00:16:28.447 --> 00:16:29.789
<v ->Forever.</v>

333
00:16:29.789 --> 00:16:33.202
Now you say, your friends in the modern world of science

334
00:16:33.202 --> 00:16:36.956
don't grok that, however, my question would be,

335
00:16:36.956 --> 00:16:40.679
what about the world that you were in for so many years,

336
00:16:40.679 --> 00:16:44.763
in the military, where you have people who have to be,

337
00:16:44.763 --> 00:16:48.070
willing to put their lives on the line for their position

338
00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.494
that they've taken or they've made a valor oath to.

339
00:16:51.494 --> 00:16:53.403
Do you find it's the same there? Or is there,

340
00:16:53.403 --> 00:16:55.963
have you ever found there's a level of kind of,

341
00:16:57.393 --> 00:17:00.639
even unspoken, maybe mystical understanding between

342
00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:03.064
warriors and soldiers that have done this repeatedly?

343
00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:04.094
<v ->Of course, yes.</v>

344
00:17:05.049 --> 00:17:08.951
I think perhaps in some way I was drawn into the military

345
00:17:08.951 --> 00:17:12.257
because I had lived a warrior in many other previous lives.

346
00:17:12.257 --> 00:17:13.719
I had been a Roman soldier.

347
00:17:13.719 --> 00:17:15.425
<v ->Yes. I would guess that.</v>

348
00:17:16.605 --> 00:17:20.127
And so do you find it, was there some unspoken understanding

349
00:17:20.127 --> 00:17:22.281
between you and some of your comrades through the years?

350
00:17:22.281 --> 00:17:23.764
<v ->Oh there was a spiritual connection.</v>

351
00:17:23.764 --> 00:17:25.385
<v ->Yes, that's what I'm getting to.</v>

352
00:17:25.385 --> 00:17:26.264
<v ->You got it</v>

353
00:17:27.197 --> 00:17:30.909
and it's powerful and it pours up from God knows where,

354
00:17:30.909 --> 00:17:32.589
no pun intended there but,

355
00:17:33.449 --> 00:17:36.025
it pours up from deep within your soul memory

356
00:17:36.777 --> 00:17:39.791
and yeah you, it's like at this conference here.

357
00:17:40.596 --> 00:17:42.771
I've been wandering around,

358
00:17:42.771 --> 00:17:45.694
looking at people I've never met in this life.

359
00:17:45.694 --> 00:17:47.938
Knowing them as old friends.

360
00:17:48.744 --> 00:17:51.377
Recognizing them and they recognize me

361
00:17:51.377 --> 00:17:55.061
and sometimes we walk up throw our arms around each other

362
00:17:55.932 --> 00:17:58.778
and you know, it's kind of, it's childish

363
00:17:58.778 --> 00:18:00.154
but kind of overwhelming.

364
00:18:00.154 --> 00:18:01.296
<v ->It's blissful.</v>

365
00:18:01.296 --> 00:18:02.214
<v ->It's wonderful, yeah.</v>

366
00:18:02.214 --> 00:18:06.701
<v ->It is. Okay, I thank you for sharing that.</v>

367
00:18:06.701 --> 00:18:09.304
I've always wondered because I don't really,

368
00:18:09.304 --> 00:18:10.989
on a deep personal level

369
00:18:10.989 --> 00:18:13.325
and going back in lifetimes in the past,

370
00:18:13.325 --> 00:18:15.533
there was only one time I saw, a very long time ago,

371
00:18:15.533 --> 00:18:17.079
were I was a foot soldier

372
00:18:17.079 --> 00:18:19.458
but mostly it's been female incarnations.

373
00:18:19.458 --> 00:18:23.159
So I don't understand that bond between soldiers and men

374
00:18:23.159 --> 00:18:26.327
but I would have to imagine, from what you've said,

375
00:18:26.327 --> 00:18:29.644
from what I've heard others say, it has to exist.

376
00:18:29.644 --> 00:18:32.672
You go into the military for a reason it certainly is not

377
00:18:32.672 --> 00:18:35.371
because of the political agendas of the day.

378
00:18:35.371 --> 00:18:37.589
It has to be something embedded much deeper within

379
00:18:38.363 --> 00:18:39.290
and so I,

380
00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:41.100
<v ->Well faith, whatever that is,</v>

381
00:18:41.821 --> 00:18:44.545
has an interesting way of playing with our lives.

382
00:18:46.151 --> 00:18:48.178
I joined the military in 1950

383
00:18:48.178 --> 00:18:51.464
because I'd been in two college for two years.

384
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.586
My dad was a railroader, we didn't have any money.

385
00:18:54.586 --> 00:18:58.183
I was born in '29, I grew up in the Depression.

386
00:18:59.331 --> 00:19:02.847
But when I was 18 I,

387
00:19:03.907 --> 00:19:06.354
went off to the University of Indiana

388
00:19:07.224 --> 00:19:10.595
for a couple of years and after the second year,

389
00:19:10.595 --> 00:19:13.874
Daddy and I, we didn't have anymore money.

390
00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:17.400
So being a smart young man, a smart ass young man,

391
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.757
I said "I know how to deal with this,

392
00:19:19.757 --> 00:19:24.427
"I will simply enlist in the army and avoid being drafted"

393
00:19:24.427 --> 00:19:27.808
because in those days if you weren't married

394
00:19:27.808 --> 00:19:31.748
or enrolled in a university, you were eligible for the draft.

395
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.962
So I didn't' want to get drafted

396
00:19:33.962 --> 00:19:37.667
because when they pluck you out, they send you where ever.

397
00:19:38.473 --> 00:19:39.977
I thought "Well I'm going to enlist

398
00:19:39.977 --> 00:19:43.146
"and go off to offices candidate school."

399
00:19:43.146 --> 00:19:46.634
Get myself a commission, serve my two years or three years

400
00:19:46.634 --> 00:19:47.668
or whatever

401
00:19:47.668 --> 00:19:51.831
and maybe go back to school and under GI Bill, you see.

402
00:19:51.831 --> 00:19:52.649
Oh I was smart,

403
00:19:52.649 --> 00:19:53.341
<v ->that was a nice illusion.</v>

404
00:19:53.341 --> 00:19:56.882
<v ->I was a smart young man, yeah what an illusion that was.</v>

405
00:19:56.882 --> 00:19:58.525
I enlisted in the army in April

406
00:19:58.525 --> 00:20:01.248
and I was an OCS for six months

407
00:20:02.139 --> 00:20:05.454
and while I was an OCS being trained to be a

408
00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:07.954
Second Lieutenant Infantry Officer,

409
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.626
the North Koreans invaded South Korea in June of 1950

410
00:20:13.837 --> 00:20:16.077
and the next damn thing I know I'm in the front lines

411
00:20:16.077 --> 00:20:17.965
of Korea being shot at by a bunch

412
00:20:17.965 --> 00:20:20.525
of pissed off Chinese and North Koreans.

413
00:20:20.525 --> 00:20:23.259
I was leading an infantry combat platoon.

414
00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:26.602
As a 21 year old Second Lieutenant,

415
00:20:26.602 --> 00:20:28.901
Shave-tail is the term used to be

416
00:20:29.973 --> 00:20:33.882
and I thought "How the hell did I get here?"

417
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.554
<v ->Well you may had been a soldier before,</v>

418
00:20:36.554 --> 00:20:37.856
<v ->I don't like this I'm not a killer,</v>

419
00:20:37.856 --> 00:20:39.765
I don't wanna shoot anybody

420
00:20:39.765 --> 00:20:43.919
and what am I don't in the middle of a damn war in 1951?

421
00:20:45.738 --> 00:20:48.564
Later, looking back after a lot of reflection,

422
00:20:48.564 --> 00:20:51.351
I understood how I got there, why I was there

423
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.985
and how that all happened.

424
00:20:55.912 --> 00:20:59.041
Oh but that's just another tiny chapter in my life.

425
00:21:01.137 --> 00:21:02.898
<v ->Because of our last interview I'm going</v>

426
00:21:02.898 --> 00:21:05.159
to refer people to that so they can get an idea

427
00:21:05.159 --> 00:21:07.655
of some of what you've been working with,

428
00:21:07.655 --> 00:21:09.809
through your career and because we're here at a

429
00:21:09.809 --> 00:21:13.447
and this is a term you hate UFO, let's say an IFO,

430
00:21:13.447 --> 00:21:15.215
an Identified Flying Object.

431
00:21:15.215 --> 00:21:16.410
(chuckles)

432
00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.294
<v ->I dislike the term.</v>

433
00:21:18.294 --> 00:21:19.936
<v ->Yeah I get it because we've identified</v>

434
00:21:19.936 --> 00:21:21.129
them for many, many years.

435
00:21:21.129 --> 00:21:23.390
<v ->Well there are no such things as UFO's.</v>

436
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:25.900
I'm not a Ufologist and I never have been.

437
00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:28.999
If you've ever heard my presentations,

438
00:21:31.009 --> 00:21:35.547
I admit to being trained as an intelligence analyst.

439
00:21:36.481 --> 00:21:39.288
and one of my great heroes was Charles Fort.

440
00:21:39.949 --> 00:21:42.702
Which I referred to in my presentation yesterday.

441
00:21:44.425 --> 00:21:47.555
He was a supreme intelligence analyst

442
00:21:48.542 --> 00:21:51.793
and when you're trained to do that you collect data,

443
00:21:51.793 --> 00:21:55.705
you collect facts, information.

444
00:21:56.393 --> 00:21:59.534
You weigh, you sift, you evaluate, you analyze.

445
00:22:00.564 --> 00:22:02.153
And you put it all together and you're trying

446
00:22:02.153 --> 00:22:04.695
to come up with a picture of some kind,

447
00:22:04.695 --> 00:22:07.417
which it's what we did and it's what I've done in my life

448
00:22:08.628 --> 00:22:09.908
and that's why I quoted

449
00:22:09.908 --> 00:22:11.280
Charles Fort yesterday in my presentation.

450
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.805
<v ->Yes, I wrote that down.</v>

451
00:22:12.805 --> 00:22:15.120
"I think we're property." It's very interesting.

452
00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.208
<v ->Yes, he was pretty close to it.</v>

453
00:22:17.938 --> 00:22:19.400
<v ->Yeah, well share that because that's where I want</v>

454
00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.371
to go with the conversation.

455
00:22:20.371 --> 00:22:23.113
<v ->Let me tell you something, we're not property,</v>

456
00:22:24.593 --> 00:22:25.979
we're a hell of a lot more than that.

457
00:22:25.979 --> 00:22:27.007
<v ->Yes we are.</v>

458
00:22:28.016 --> 00:22:29.211
<v ->The conclusion I have reached,</v>

459
00:22:29.211 --> 00:22:32.447
I supposed the closest I could come to is,

460
00:22:33.701 --> 00:22:37.097
saying we are involved in what I would call a,

461
00:22:41.445 --> 00:22:43.048
a trusty ship.

462
00:22:45.144 --> 00:22:47.463
We are under trusty ship.

463
00:22:48.193 --> 00:22:50.289
The planet, the species, the race,

464
00:22:51.543 --> 00:22:55.899
we're being monitored by a group of trusties, so to speak.

465
00:22:56.821 --> 00:22:58.868
We're being nurtured, we're being encouraged,

466
00:22:58.868 --> 00:23:02.723
we're being assisted and we're being guided

467
00:23:04.403 --> 00:23:07.836
to help the human race through this painful,

468
00:23:07.836 --> 00:23:10.603
painful transition we're in right now

469
00:23:11.591 --> 00:23:12.871
and you've heard me before

470
00:23:12.871 --> 00:23:16.316
but I consider it not merely a transitory transition.

471
00:23:17.666 --> 00:23:20.965
It's a transcendent transformation into a new species

472
00:23:20.965 --> 00:23:22.907
and into a new race.

473
00:23:22.907 --> 00:23:23.891
<v ->Yes.</v>

474
00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:28.200
<v ->And we have some good friends in high places.</v>

475
00:23:28.963 --> 00:23:31.924
That are assisting us and have from the very beginning.

476
00:23:31.924 --> 00:23:34.213
<v ->And from what you've told me before in our conversation</v>

477
00:23:34.213 --> 00:23:36.079
out in the field here privately yesterday,

478
00:23:36.079 --> 00:23:38.184
we have some good friends now in low places.

479
00:23:38.947 --> 00:23:39.713
<v ->Well.</v>

480
00:23:39.713 --> 00:23:42.377
(both laughs)

481
00:23:42.377 --> 00:23:44.691
<v ->I'm speaking of course of the underground bases</v>

482
00:23:44.691 --> 00:23:45.948
and what's been going on.
<v Robert>people say,</v>

483
00:23:45.948 --> 00:23:47.697
"Who are they?" you know?

484
00:23:47.697 --> 00:23:49.999
Oh when are they going to land?

485
00:23:49.999 --> 00:23:52.079
And I think "Oh my God!"

486
00:23:52.079 --> 00:23:53.294
<v ->If you only knew.</v>

487
00:23:53.294 --> 00:23:54.856
<v ->Yeah, if they only knew.</v>

488
00:23:55.683 --> 00:23:58.776
<v ->Tell us, tell the viewer about</v>

489
00:23:58.776 --> 00:24:01.702
what you were telling me yesterday, about the nature,

490
00:24:02.614 --> 00:24:04.203
the types of beings that are

491
00:24:04.203 --> 00:24:06.315
working on these underground bases

492
00:24:06.315 --> 00:24:09.776
and some of the directive that's come in of late.

493
00:24:11.296 --> 00:24:12.672
<v ->Well we're dealing with</v>

494
00:24:12.672 --> 00:24:15.546
intelligence's from different planets.

495
00:24:16.491 --> 00:24:18.101
We're dealing with advanced

496
00:24:18.101 --> 00:24:22.103
intelligence from different star systems, different galaxy's

497
00:24:23.112 --> 00:24:26.186
and in '76 when I retired the army had learned

498
00:24:27.888 --> 00:24:29.333
a tremendous shock to them.

499
00:24:30.106 --> 00:24:32.585
We're dealing with intelligence's from other dimensions.

500
00:24:32.585 --> 00:24:33.421
<v ->Yes.</v>

501
00:24:34.451 --> 00:24:36.744
<v ->That are popping into our reality here</v>

502
00:24:36.744 --> 00:24:39.536
from another time and another place

503
00:24:39.536 --> 00:24:42.386
and let me tell you, back in those years,

504
00:24:42.386 --> 00:24:45.663
the realization of that to a lot of people was overwhelming.

505
00:24:47.568 --> 00:24:49.189
Interplanetary, interstellar,

506
00:24:49.189 --> 00:24:51.231
intergalactic that's all a given.

507
00:24:52.442 --> 00:24:55.482
But when you have to face a reality that you're dealing with

508
00:24:55.482 --> 00:24:57.338
advanced intelligence's that are

509
00:24:57.338 --> 00:25:00.644
coming from other dimensions and back in those days, honey,

510
00:25:00.644 --> 00:25:02.927
they didn't even know what the hell another dimension was.

511
00:25:02.927 --> 00:25:04.857
<v ->Exactly, it wasn't part of our thinking.</v>

512
00:25:04.857 --> 00:25:07.471
<v ->No it wasn't part of the scientific idea at all.</v>

513
00:25:07.471 --> 00:25:11.195
Even today you have scientists who have a problem with it

514
00:25:12.588 --> 00:25:17.286
and I have developed a very powerful impatience

515
00:25:18.078 --> 00:25:20.834
with so called mainstream establishment science.

516
00:25:22.109 --> 00:25:24.699
You know, I've spoken at several universities,

517
00:25:24.699 --> 00:25:26.453
I've been invited to speak

518
00:25:27.366 --> 00:25:29.136
and I've encountered the faculties

519
00:25:29.136 --> 00:25:30.884
at some of these universities.

520
00:25:30.884 --> 00:25:32.729
Some years back I spoke at the

521
00:25:32.729 --> 00:25:34.994
University of Arizona in Tucson.

522
00:25:35.716 --> 00:25:37.896
I was invited by a professor who was a friend.

523
00:25:39.043 --> 00:25:40.541
He set up this lecture,

524
00:25:41.347 --> 00:25:43.033
<v ->Not Gary.</v>

525
00:25:43.033 --> 00:25:44.632
<v ->Not Gary, no I know Gary Schwartz,</v>

526
00:25:44.632 --> 00:25:46.744
he's a beautiful, beautiful man.

527
00:25:46.744 --> 00:25:48.536
<v ->Okay, just wondering. So someone else.</v>

528
00:25:48.536 --> 00:25:51.341
<v ->Anyhow, my friend set me up here</v>

529
00:25:51.341 --> 00:25:53.340
and invited me as a guest speaker.

530
00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.258
The auditorium was packed, literally,

531
00:25:56.258 --> 00:25:59.612
there were 1600, 1800 kids there

532
00:26:00.545 --> 00:26:01.623
and I spoke for two hours

533
00:26:01.623 --> 00:26:03.697
and showed them photographs and pictures.

534
00:26:04.365 --> 00:26:05.559
And shared information that I

535
00:26:05.559 --> 00:26:07.652
shared with everybody, literally.

536
00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.407
The kids loved it, they literally loved what I was saying.

537
00:26:12.407 --> 00:26:13.789
They wanted to know more.

538
00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:16.153
I jokingly refer back to it,

539
00:26:16.153 --> 00:26:18.845
the faculty wanted to burn me at the stake.

540
00:26:20.345 --> 00:26:21.315
<v ->I think they wanted to burn</v>

541
00:26:21.315 --> 00:26:22.659
Gary at the stake a few times too.

542
00:26:22.659 --> 00:26:23.835
<v ->Oh yeah.</v>

543
00:26:25.185 --> 00:26:26.060
<v ->Understandably,</v>

544
00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.118
I mean you're pushing against everything that

545
00:26:28.118 --> 00:26:29.558
is considered true.
<v Robert>you're shaking the</v>

546
00:26:29.558 --> 00:26:31.632
foundations of their whole life.

547
00:26:32.705 --> 00:26:35.796
Anyhow, I spoke every time I was invited

548
00:26:35.796 --> 00:26:39.703
and I found that the younger generation was wide open to it.

549
00:26:40.894 --> 00:26:44.851
But it was the old dyed in the wool, hard nosed old farts

550
00:26:44.851 --> 00:26:48.840
who refused to open their minds to accept anything.

551
00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.303
<v ->So then I assume you were speaking about the notion</v>

552
00:26:52.303 --> 00:26:57.261
of multidimensional entities beings working with us,

553
00:26:57.261 --> 00:26:59.170
is this part of what you were speaking to them about?

554
00:26:59.170 --> 00:26:59.904
<v ->Yeah.</v>

555
00:26:59.904 --> 00:27:02.293
<v ->And so let's continue down that road then,</v>

556
00:27:02.293 --> 00:27:05.589
about what they're doing here and I mean,

557
00:27:05.589 --> 00:27:09.108
because we've heard Phil Snider's work, I mean, certainly

558
00:27:09.108 --> 00:27:13.758
and from the late 1990's and others who have talked about

559
00:27:13.758 --> 00:27:17.852
underground bases and firestorms, you know,

560
00:27:17.852 --> 00:27:21.039
horrible things, lots of deaths and greys.

561
00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:24.066
But that's not exactly what you're talking about here is it?

562
00:27:24.066 --> 00:27:25.595
<v ->No that's not it.</v>

563
00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.961
What I try to stress,

564
00:27:27.961 --> 00:27:31.018
which I feel is the most important thing is,

565
00:27:31.018 --> 00:27:33.476
the spiritual component of it all

566
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:36.564
and there is a tremendous spiritual

567
00:27:36.564 --> 00:27:38.314
component to this entire thing.

568
00:27:38.314 --> 00:27:39.129
<v ->Yes.</v>

569
00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:41.527
<v ->And I learned,</v>

570
00:27:42.739 --> 00:27:45.471
things that I was not prepared for myself.

571
00:27:46.661 --> 00:27:49.466
As I told Kerry Cassidy once during an interview, I said,

572
00:27:49.466 --> 00:27:52.879
"You know, I went through a process of growth

573
00:27:52.879 --> 00:27:56.403
"and development myself that was almost overwhelming to me."

574
00:27:57.209 --> 00:27:58.895
I jokingly said that I went through a period

575
00:27:58.895 --> 00:28:02.228
of time where I began to think that I was losing my mind

576
00:28:04.153 --> 00:28:06.265
and then the second faze of this development

577
00:28:06.265 --> 00:28:09.139
was that I became convinced that I had lost my mind

578
00:28:10.468 --> 00:28:13.899
and I told Kerry that I was now at stage three where,

579
00:28:14.681 --> 00:28:17.649
I'm sane, the rest of the world is nuts, you know?

580
00:28:17.649 --> 00:28:18.364
<v ->Yeah.</v>

581
00:28:18.364 --> 00:28:20.372
<v ->And that's where I'm at now in stage three.</v>

582
00:28:21.338 --> 00:28:23.396
<v ->But you've been privy to a lot of information</v>

583
00:28:23.396 --> 00:28:25.415
that the rest of the world hasn't been privy to.

584
00:28:26.723 --> 00:28:30.108
<v ->Regina, I damn near died.</v>

585
00:28:31.096 --> 00:28:36.086
The period of revolution, the period of evolution,

586
00:28:36.086 --> 00:28:39.054
the period of growth, discovery, that I went through.

587
00:28:40.308 --> 00:28:44.393
Was almost more than I could deal with and I said the series

588
00:28:44.393 --> 00:28:47.644
of past life regressions was an Earth changing,

589
00:28:47.644 --> 00:28:49.452
life changing experience.

590
00:28:50.321 --> 00:28:54.076
But being confronted with the reality of them,

591
00:28:54.076 --> 00:28:57.257
who they are, where they're from, why they're here.

592
00:28:58.351 --> 00:29:00.644
I found that rather difficult to grasp

593
00:29:00.644 --> 00:29:03.692
and I was forced to grasp it.

594
00:29:03.692 --> 00:29:05.543
Cause I was immersed in the middle of it

595
00:29:06.754 --> 00:29:08.919
and I may have shared this with you before

596
00:29:08.919 --> 00:29:12.950
but I began to go through a period of time where I

597
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:16.687
began to have face to face confrontation with some of them.

598
00:29:17.899 --> 00:29:19.723
They would come up to me after a conference

599
00:29:19.723 --> 00:29:21.455
and introduce themselves.

600
00:29:22.592 --> 00:29:25.226
<v ->Let's bring up another element here,</v>

601
00:29:25.226 --> 00:29:28.566
of your background and that is remote viewing as well.

602
00:29:28.566 --> 00:29:30.551
So you had opened yourself to be able

603
00:29:30.551 --> 00:29:33.217
to see with other eyes, by this time.

604
00:29:33.217 --> 00:29:34.679
<v ->Well I think you know,</v>

605
00:29:34.679 --> 00:29:37.242
I walked away from this so called community.

606
00:29:38.175 --> 00:29:40.223
As I said, I've never been Ufologist.

607
00:29:40.223 --> 00:29:41.570
I hate the term UFO.

608
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.065
I don't like the term alien, that's not appropriate.

609
00:29:46.065 --> 00:29:46.848
<v ->No.</v>

610
00:29:47.995 --> 00:29:50.014
<v ->And I don't even like the term ET.</v>

611
00:29:51.535 --> 00:29:54.974
Cause they're so fundamental so primitive, you know?

612
00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:59.358
I was confronted with the reality of infinite life.

613
00:30:00.452 --> 00:30:03.163
An infinite universe filled with intelligence.

614
00:30:04.214 --> 00:30:06.672
A spiritual world, a spiritual universe

615
00:30:08.726 --> 00:30:10.774
and that's when I began to realize that

616
00:30:10.774 --> 00:30:13.200
I had been on a spiritual journey myself

617
00:30:14.272 --> 00:30:16.341
and when I began to have face to face

618
00:30:16.341 --> 00:30:17.935
meetings with some of them.

619
00:30:18.965 --> 00:30:21.123
And then I began to be picked up and taken

620
00:30:22.153 --> 00:30:23.731
and I've said this before to many

621
00:30:23.731 --> 00:30:27.149
of my old traditional friends think I'm a nutcase.

622
00:30:28.104 --> 00:30:29.427
But I've been aboard the ships

623
00:30:30.927 --> 00:30:35.927
and the thing that I shared just last February with Camelot.

624
00:30:37.143 --> 00:30:38.385
That I was taken,

625
00:30:39.639 --> 00:30:43.675
I think around the year of 2003 somewhere in that period.

626
00:30:45.367 --> 00:30:47.328
I was taken to some place

627
00:30:48.902 --> 00:30:50.986
and I was kept six weeks

628
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.835
and then I was brought back five,

629
00:30:55.835 --> 00:30:57.883
10 minutes after I had been taken.

630
00:30:57.883 --> 00:30:58.783
<v ->Yes.</v>

631
00:31:00.282 --> 00:31:03.205
<v ->And I saw that to people and they scratch their heads</v>

632
00:31:03.205 --> 00:31:06.383
and they look at me, you've lost it you old fart,

633
00:31:06.383 --> 00:31:08.175
you've gone over the edge you see.

634
00:31:08.175 --> 00:31:10.266
<v ->Well you went over the edge of the time space continuum.</v>

635
00:31:10.266 --> 00:31:13.092
<v ->Oh my God, you know and coming face to face with,</v>

636
00:31:14.532 --> 00:31:18.299
trying to confront a reality of how we understand time.

637
00:31:18.299 --> 00:31:19.531
<v ->Tell us what you learned,</v>

638
00:31:19.531 --> 00:31:22.782
<v ->Time is not at all what</v>

639
00:31:22.782 --> 00:31:24.766
we human beings think it is.

640
00:31:24.766 --> 00:31:25.606
<v ->Right.</v>

641
00:31:25.606 --> 00:31:27.812
<v ->You know, we live in a three dimensional,</v>

642
00:31:27.812 --> 00:31:29.284
materialistic world

643
00:31:30.188 --> 00:31:32.333
and we have our clocks on our wrists

644
00:31:32.333 --> 00:31:35.299
and we have a 24 hour day

645
00:31:35.299 --> 00:31:38.669
and 12 months in a year and all blah blah blah blah blah.

646
00:31:38.669 --> 00:31:40.551
That is not the reality.

647
00:31:42.028 --> 00:31:44.571
The reality is so far beyond that,

648
00:31:44.571 --> 00:31:46.487
when you're out there there is no time

649
00:31:47.581 --> 00:31:50.652
and then you confront the reality that yesterday, today

650
00:31:50.652 --> 00:31:53.921
and tomorrow is all the same.

651
00:31:55.772 --> 00:31:59.520
The reality is that there is a infinite now.

652
00:32:00.621 --> 00:32:03.810
<v ->And that is hard for the left side of our brains to--</v>

653
00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:06.123
<v ->Regina, I'm still having to come to terms with that.</v>

654
00:32:07.173 --> 00:32:09.127
<v ->Well what else did you learn when you were</v>

655
00:32:09.127 --> 00:32:11.052
in this experience, what were you shown?

656
00:32:11.052 --> 00:32:12.071
What did you see?

657
00:32:12.071 --> 00:32:13.079
<v ->They took me somewhere</v>

658
00:32:13.079 --> 00:32:14.711
and people say where did they take you?

659
00:32:14.711 --> 00:32:16.559
Did they take you to their planet?

660
00:32:18.805 --> 00:32:20.523
I don't know where I was.

661
00:32:21.472 --> 00:32:23.381
I know that they kept me for six weeks

662
00:32:23.381 --> 00:32:25.535
and I found the interesting thing to me,

663
00:32:25.535 --> 00:32:28.240
they were as interested in me as I was in them.

664
00:32:29.142 --> 00:32:31.009
I kept asking them questions,

665
00:32:31.009 --> 00:32:34.111
oh I was, I just couldn't get enough.

666
00:32:34.111 --> 00:32:36.545
I wanted to know everything

667
00:32:37.511 --> 00:32:40.071
and they were interested in me as a human being

668
00:32:40.071 --> 00:32:43.933
or as a spiritual being inside this temporary human body

669
00:32:44.984 --> 00:32:47.409
and then I found out later that the human,

670
00:32:48.524 --> 00:32:50.907
as we understand ourselves as humans.

671
00:32:52.097 --> 00:32:55.478
We are a unique, rare

672
00:32:55.478 --> 00:33:00.239
and special biological entity.

673
00:33:01.963 --> 00:33:04.789
That the human genome in the universe

674
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:08.815
is regarded as a treasure because it's so unique.

675
00:33:09.952 --> 00:33:12.532
The human genome that each and everyone of us are wearing

676
00:33:12.532 --> 00:33:16.063
and carrying around with us now, temporarily.

677
00:33:17.155 --> 00:33:20.551
Is kind of a special one, it is a blend apparently

678
00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:25.894
of parts and pieces and factors of,

679
00:33:27.703 --> 00:33:30.918
interstellar, inter-time genome.

680
00:33:31.948 --> 00:33:34.752
We are a blend of so many different species

681
00:33:34.752 --> 00:33:35.960
and different races.

682
00:33:36.918 --> 00:33:38.986
Which is why they consider us quite unique

683
00:33:38.986 --> 00:33:42.036
and kind of interesting and that's why they're trying

684
00:33:42.036 --> 00:33:44.153
to help us survive as a species.

685
00:33:45.225 --> 00:33:47.540
Now I'm not that interested in my reality

686
00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:50.260
as a member of a species at the moment

687
00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:51.721
because I know that I'm an immortal,

688
00:33:51.721 --> 00:33:53.677
eternal, spiritual being.

689
00:33:54.526 --> 00:33:56.907
But I happen to be living in this container,

690
00:33:57.991 --> 00:33:59.311
per a short period of time.

691
00:33:59.311 --> 00:34:02.684
I've been here 82 year in this particular run through

692
00:34:03.799 --> 00:34:06.402
and I'll be honest with you, Regina, I'm getting to a point

693
00:34:06.402 --> 00:34:08.646
where I'm kind of home sick.

694
00:34:09.655 --> 00:34:11.526
I'm looking forward to getting out of here.

695
00:34:12.459 --> 00:34:13.941
<v ->Out of the restriction.</v>

696
00:34:13.941 --> 00:34:16.586
<v ->Well this old carcass that I'm living in,</v>

697
00:34:16.586 --> 00:34:20.218
this container that I'm temporarily immersed in

698
00:34:20.218 --> 00:34:21.843
is falling apart on me.

699
00:34:22.791 --> 00:34:24.819
My knees are shot, my hearing is gone.

700
00:34:24.819 --> 00:34:27.788
I've been told recently that I'm losing my eye sight.

701
00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.770
Ah, you know, I'm breaking down

702
00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:32.833
and that's a natural process.

703
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:37.430
This human body is not designed to live forever.

704
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:40.088
Although I have learned that that is a capability,

705
00:34:40.088 --> 00:34:41.731
that's a possibility.

706
00:34:41.731 --> 00:34:43.661
I found that some of the Ananoky

707
00:34:43.661 --> 00:34:45.446
and I use that term generically

708
00:34:46.401 --> 00:34:48.310
As you know the old Sumerian it means,

709
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:50.485
merely those who came down from above.

710
00:34:50.485 --> 00:34:52.920
Those who from Heaven to Earth came.

711
00:34:54.036 --> 00:34:56.723
Well I use that term generically but,

712
00:34:57.633 --> 00:34:59.343
it applies to one particular group that

713
00:34:59.343 --> 00:35:02.334
had a hand in our genetic manipulation.

714
00:35:03.343 --> 00:35:05.766
They help re-engineer our genome,

715
00:35:06.838 --> 00:35:08.464
200 thousand years ago.

716
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:10.477
According to Zachariah,

717
00:35:11.444 --> 00:35:13.272
300 thousand years ago.

718
00:35:15.529 --> 00:35:18.088
But the manipulation of the human genome

719
00:35:18.088 --> 00:35:20.972
has been going on since the beginning.

720
00:35:20.972 --> 00:35:24.264
When this creature, this animal we call human being,

721
00:35:24.264 --> 00:35:25.933
came down out of the trees.

722
00:35:28.626 --> 00:35:31.069
People say, well who are we originally?

723
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:34.090
Well the closest I can come to is there's an old,

724
00:35:35.344 --> 00:35:38.420
old creature they referred to as Australopithecus

725
00:35:39.472 --> 00:35:42.098
and that's what they found when they first came here

726
00:35:42.925 --> 00:35:46.023
and they started to manipulate and engineer the genome.

727
00:35:46.913 --> 00:35:50.511
And they created human, what is, what do we call ourselves?

728
00:35:50.511 --> 00:35:51.888
Homosapien or Sapien?

729
00:35:51.888 --> 00:35:52.631
<v ->Yes.</v>

730
00:35:52.631 --> 00:35:56.214
<v ->Well for some of them there's a lot more Sapien's there,</v>

731
00:35:57.914 --> 00:35:59.704
add three or four Sapien's to it.

732
00:35:59.704 --> 00:36:02.466
<v ->Yes and so we've been engineered and worked through</v>

733
00:36:02.466 --> 00:36:05.910
and you say we're still being worked on.

734
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:07.659
<v ->The process is still underway.</v>

735
00:36:07.659 --> 00:36:08.534
<v ->Can you talk about,</v>

736
00:36:08.534 --> 00:36:11.680
<v ->Biologically and physically the human genome</v>

737
00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.283
is still under manipulation and development

738
00:36:15.153 --> 00:36:17.552
and when I speak publicly to people

739
00:36:17.552 --> 00:36:19.219
and I say "My God you guys are

740
00:36:19.219 --> 00:36:21.429
"living in an incredible time."

741
00:36:21.429 --> 00:36:24.473
If you realize not only how unique and special you were.

742
00:36:24.473 --> 00:36:29.096
As a biological creature, beyond the spiritual component.

743
00:36:30.488 --> 00:36:32.796
You would take a lot more pride in who you are.

744
00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.853
<v ->Absolutely. As one dear friend of mine said</v>

745
00:36:35.853 --> 00:36:38.904
"You'd lean over and kiss yourself on the shoulder."

746
00:36:38.904 --> 00:36:42.168
<v ->Yes. You would pat your cheeks and say, you know,</v>

747
00:36:42.168 --> 00:36:43.672
"oh you're pretty special"

748
00:36:43.672 --> 00:36:45.372
You're unique.

749
00:36:45.372 --> 00:36:47.217
<v ->We're unique and so,</v>

750
00:36:47.217 --> 00:36:48.357
do you wanna go ahead

751
00:36:48.357 --> 00:36:50.309
and light up and I'll ask a question while you light up,

752
00:36:50.309 --> 00:36:53.701
<v ->Well I was gonna refer to my grandmother, beautiful,</v>

753
00:36:53.701 --> 00:36:55.663
beautiful, very great soul.

754
00:36:56.516 --> 00:36:58.869
She used to tell me as a little tike she said,

755
00:36:58.869 --> 00:37:01.945
"If we could only see ourselves as others see us."

756
00:37:02.868 --> 00:37:05.428
Well I've broadened that concept to a bit

757
00:37:05.428 --> 00:37:08.361
where I say if we could only see ourselves

758
00:37:08.361 --> 00:37:10.498
as The Others, see us

759
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.679
and that was part of the shock of my revelation as it were.

760
00:37:16.338 --> 00:37:19.905
I began to see the human species as they see us

761
00:37:21.394 --> 00:37:24.547
and as an extraterrestrial scientist

762
00:37:24.547 --> 00:37:25.784
said to a friend of mine,

763
00:37:25.784 --> 00:37:27.630
a retired navy physicist,

764
00:37:29.108 --> 00:37:32.052
well that's a story I put out on the interview

765
00:37:32.052 --> 00:37:33.912
with Kerry sometime back.

766
00:37:34.558 --> 00:37:36.619
During my sons retirement party,

767
00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:42.054
we were all there at this big festival

768
00:37:42.054 --> 00:37:45.509
this celebration, my son was retiring after 30 years

769
00:37:45.509 --> 00:37:47.381
as a full captain in the navy

770
00:37:48.133 --> 00:37:50.224
and there were several admirals and a couple of generals

771
00:37:50.224 --> 00:37:52.154
and a bunch of scientists.

772
00:37:52.154 --> 00:37:53.983
Guys he'd served with over the years

773
00:37:55.141 --> 00:37:56.666
and during the party I'm standing

774
00:37:56.666 --> 00:37:59.113
around mingling with the group

775
00:38:00.696 --> 00:38:02.763
and this retired commander come over

776
00:38:02.763 --> 00:38:04.292
and he elbowed me.

777
00:38:05.151 --> 00:38:06.969
He says "I know you, I know you."

778
00:38:07.657 --> 00:38:09.769
and I said "Sure I'm Eric's dad."

779
00:38:09.769 --> 00:38:11.293
He says "No, no, no, I know you.

780
00:38:11.293 --> 00:38:14.749
"You're that loud mouth command sergeant major retired

781
00:38:14.749 --> 00:38:16.776
"whos speaking out on this subject,

782
00:38:16.776 --> 00:38:18.258
blah blah blah blah blah."

783
00:38:18.258 --> 00:38:19.538
I says "Yeah that's me."

784
00:38:19.538 --> 00:38:20.477
(chuckles)

785
00:38:20.477 --> 00:38:23.036
He says "I have a short story to share with you"

786
00:38:24.028 --> 00:38:25.569
and he says "You're one of the few people

787
00:38:25.569 --> 00:38:26.943
"I can talk to about this."

788
00:38:26.943 --> 00:38:30.012
He says "I spent five years working at an underground

789
00:38:30.012 --> 00:38:33.163
"federal facility not far out of Las Vegas."

790
00:38:34.193 --> 00:38:38.388
and he says "My specialty is a plasma fusion physics."

791
00:38:40.144 --> 00:38:44.390
and he says "I had the privilege with working closely

792
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:46.095
"with two of those guys."

793
00:38:47.189 --> 00:38:49.487
and he says "That was quite and experience."

794
00:38:50.623 --> 00:38:53.818
He said "As I was preparing to retire and leave."

795
00:38:53.818 --> 00:38:57.293
he says "I said to this one chap that I'd gotten to know,"

796
00:38:58.728 --> 00:39:00.456
They were huge, they looked like us,

797
00:39:00.456 --> 00:39:02.514
they just as human looking as we are.

798
00:39:02.514 --> 00:39:06.792
and he said "Before I leave, tell me what you guys

799
00:39:06.792 --> 00:39:08.940
"really think of human beings."

800
00:39:10.781 --> 00:39:14.263
And this one fellow said "Well since you asked.

801
00:39:15.975 --> 00:39:18.460
"We look upon the human species at the moment

802
00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:21.967
as a primitive, savage and dangerous group of animals."

803
00:39:24.404 --> 00:39:28.199
and this chap said "I hope that's not offensive to you

804
00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:31.169
"but that's how we look at the entire race."

805
00:39:32.178 --> 00:39:34.194
and the retired navy scientist says

806
00:39:34.194 --> 00:39:38.151
"Well I can't argue with that. I have the same opinion.

807
00:39:38.151 --> 00:39:40.587
"We are primitive, savage and dangerous animals.

808
00:39:41.681 --> 00:39:44.160
"I mean my God we're still going to war.

809
00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.681
"We're war like, we're a species that

810
00:39:45.681 --> 00:39:48.126
"has not evolved as far enough yet."

811
00:39:48.126 --> 00:39:50.014
And he says "I couldn't fight with,

812
00:39:50.014 --> 00:39:51.570
"I couldn't argue with him."

813
00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:54.650
And then the other chap from out there

814
00:39:55.881 --> 00:39:58.269
looked in and he says "You also smell bad."

815
00:39:58.269 --> 00:39:59.549
<v ->You smell bad.</v>

816
00:39:59.549 --> 00:40:01.885
<v ->He says "You humans stink."</v>

817
00:40:01.885 --> 00:40:03.837
(both laugh)

818
00:40:03.837 --> 00:40:06.299
The navy commander says "I thought that was hilarious."

819
00:40:06.299 --> 00:40:07.111
He says,

820
00:40:07.111 --> 00:40:07.783
(sniffs)

821
00:40:07.783 --> 00:40:09.404
I took my shower this morning

822
00:40:10.644 --> 00:40:13.996
and the fellow says "No, no, no, no, it's not that.

823
00:40:15.047 --> 00:40:18.218
"You have what we call an oricstench,

824
00:40:19.322 --> 00:40:21.381
"the nature of your condition,

825
00:40:21.381 --> 00:40:23.977
"the nature of your physical development,

826
00:40:23.977 --> 00:40:26.748
"your evolution, as animals,

827
00:40:27.798 --> 00:40:31.659
is that you have this aura about you

828
00:40:32.711 --> 00:40:36.288
"that we find somewhat offensive.

829
00:40:38.098 --> 00:40:41.760
"It involves the nature of your aura."

830
00:40:44.418 --> 00:40:45.415
The commander says

831
00:40:45.415 --> 00:40:49.013
"That gave me a number of years of thought."

832
00:40:50.288 --> 00:40:51.877
Anyhow that's one of the little things

833
00:40:51.877 --> 00:40:54.277
that was shared with me over the years.

834
00:40:54.277 --> 00:40:56.949
<v ->But at the same time you say, from other reflections,</v>

835
00:40:56.949 --> 00:41:00.141
that this species is so precious to so many.

836
00:41:01.065 --> 00:41:04.408
<v ->Well, we are a puzzle to many of them.</v>

837
00:41:05.662 --> 00:41:07.368
You know there are intelligence's

838
00:41:07.368 --> 00:41:08.914
out there that don't like us at all.

839
00:41:08.914 --> 00:41:09.547
<v ->Yes.</v>

840
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:12.635
<v ->You know, you and I would go off maybe</v>

841
00:41:12.635 --> 00:41:16.468
or the average person might go off to New Guinea

842
00:41:17.594 --> 00:41:19.962
and you would look upon the natives over there that,

843
00:41:20.949 --> 00:41:24.003
just a year or two out of cannibalism.

844
00:41:24.991 --> 00:41:26.997
And they run around in the jungles and their naked,

845
00:41:28.007 --> 00:41:30.570
they have these little wars and these clan fights

846
00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:33.123
and they eat each other.

847
00:41:33.123 --> 00:41:34.541
Well they used to at least,

848
00:41:35.295 --> 00:41:37.160
I'm told that they stopped doing that now.

849
00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.532
Although I don't believe that entirely.

850
00:41:42.312 --> 00:41:44.925
My God we are a primitive species

851
00:41:44.925 --> 00:41:47.936
and yet we are unique and we are treasured,

852
00:41:47.936 --> 00:41:50.212
we are special and we are rare.

853
00:41:51.242 --> 00:41:53.915
<v ->And we have this deep schism within our the psyche</v>

854
00:41:53.915 --> 00:41:57.375
because of the lack of integration between that much finer,

855
00:41:58.245 --> 00:42:01.903
more beautiful everlasting aspect of self

856
00:42:01.903 --> 00:42:04.730
and the animal portion, with the animal mind

857
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:07.145
and the animal emotions.

858
00:42:07.145 --> 00:42:10.009
I mean it's really the schism that creates

859
00:42:10.009 --> 00:42:12.676
the issues in the aura that smells so bad.

860
00:42:12.676 --> 00:42:13.465
(laughs)

861
00:42:13.465 --> 00:42:16.068
To other species, it's not the nature of who we are,

862
00:42:16.068 --> 00:42:18.001
our essence, at our essence at all.

863
00:42:18.914 --> 00:42:20.026
<v ->That's right.</v>

864
00:42:20.026 --> 00:42:21.125
<v ->And you've seen that.</v>

865
00:42:21.994 --> 00:42:24.524
<v ->I've felt that, I've lived that.</v>

866
00:42:25.789 --> 00:42:28.190
<v ->And so I think one of the things I'm kind</v>

867
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:31.464
of nudging you towards is because in our last interview

868
00:42:31.464 --> 00:42:35.603
we did speak about some of these under mountain,

869
00:42:35.603 --> 00:42:38.001
underwater, some of these deep facilities that are

870
00:42:38.001 --> 00:42:40.710
inhabited by other species and have been for a very,

871
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:42.129
very long time on this planet.

872
00:42:42.129 --> 00:42:44.764
But you said there's a change in the plan

873
00:42:44.764 --> 00:42:46.453
in the way this is being worked.

874
00:42:48.624 --> 00:42:51.840
<v ->Well let me tell you what's been shared with me.</v>

875
00:42:53.744 --> 00:42:57.045
I've been told and I believe it, it makes sense.

876
00:42:58.149 --> 00:43:02.282
There is a spiritual hierarchy out there

877
00:43:03.333 --> 00:43:04.639
in the universe

878
00:43:06.629 --> 00:43:10.201
and the analogy that I've been given

879
00:43:10.201 --> 00:43:12.987
and the analogy that makes sense to me is that

880
00:43:13.974 --> 00:43:16.470
and it's kind of amusing but you look at the pyramid

881
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:18.223
that appears on the dollar bill.

882
00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:21.753
This unfinished pyramid.

883
00:43:22.588 --> 00:43:24.363
<v ->Separated capstone.</v>

884
00:43:24.363 --> 00:43:26.654
<v ->And there's no top to it like it's unfinished</v>

885
00:43:27.534 --> 00:43:30.720
and then there's this symbol of an eye on the top of it.

886
00:43:31.666 --> 00:43:34.267
Apparently that is a very accurate description

887
00:43:34.267 --> 00:43:38.176
of the existing hierarchy out there in time and space.

888
00:43:39.366 --> 00:43:43.093
Now you have all these different levels of life.

889
00:43:44.528 --> 00:43:47.019
A variety of biological forms

890
00:43:47.909 --> 00:43:49.981
and that's almost infinite apparently.

891
00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:54.691
And we find that the human species at the moment

892
00:43:54.691 --> 00:43:57.660
is about the third or fourth level up from the bottom.

893
00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:00.293
That's where we are now

894
00:44:01.505 --> 00:44:05.232
and then six or eight levels above that you the Anamoki

895
00:44:05.974 --> 00:44:08.980
and six or eight levels above that you have an other group

896
00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:11.602
of species and races out there.

897
00:44:11.602 --> 00:44:14.242
But the higher you get in this so called pyramid,

898
00:44:15.271 --> 00:44:18.514
the higher the spiritual development apparently is

899
00:44:18.514 --> 00:44:22.002
and at the very top of this hierarchy.

900
00:44:22.002 --> 00:44:25.115
You have intelligence's out there that

901
00:44:25.115 --> 00:44:28.716
are almost purely spiritual in nature

902
00:44:30.087 --> 00:44:31.776
and they have power.

903
00:44:32.626 --> 00:44:34.102
They have infinite power

904
00:44:35.675 --> 00:44:39.086
and apparently the lower levels,

905
00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.499
I refer to generically the Anonoki.

906
00:44:43.913 --> 00:44:47.252
Got themselves into a bind, the got into a little trouble

907
00:44:47.252 --> 00:44:52.079
because over the centuries, eons of time, they were faulted

908
00:44:52.079 --> 00:44:54.557
for the fact that they got involved in our

909
00:44:54.557 --> 00:44:58.426
biological development for the wrong reasons

910
00:44:58.426 --> 00:44:59.664
and you know the Anonoki

911
00:44:59.664 --> 00:45:01.763
and Zachariah lays it out so beautifully.

912
00:45:01.763 --> 00:45:04.601
<v ->Yeah so Michael Telinger going with that further.</v>

913
00:45:04.601 --> 00:45:07.651
<v ->Christian O'Brien, who's no longer with us,</v>

914
00:45:07.651 --> 00:45:12.377
brilliant British scientist, researcher.

915
00:45:12.377 --> 00:45:16.196
Who could translate Cuneiform as well as Zachariah did.

916
00:45:16.196 --> 00:45:19.474
Wrote this beautiful book called The Genius of the Few

917
00:45:20.589 --> 00:45:23.644
and he wrote another one call The Shining Ones.

918
00:45:24.568 --> 00:45:26.509
Well apparently you see, back,

919
00:45:27.519 --> 00:45:29.589
The Anonaki in this generic sense,

920
00:45:30.523 --> 00:45:33.843
involved themselves with us biologically and genetically.

921
00:45:34.628 --> 00:45:35.620
For selfish reasons,

922
00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.432
they really wanted a slave race back,

923
00:45:40.441 --> 00:45:42.173
way the hell back in time

924
00:45:42.937 --> 00:45:45.027
and Michael Telinger touches upon this,

925
00:45:46.127 --> 00:45:48.454
which is some of the reasons the work that

926
00:45:48.454 --> 00:45:49.819
he's done is beautiful.

927
00:45:49.819 --> 00:45:51.579
<v ->And the human beings,</v>

928
00:45:51.579 --> 00:45:54.306
the beings at that time were ripe for exploitation.

929
00:45:54.306 --> 00:45:57.944
<v ->Well we were a species that was very primitive,</v>

930
00:45:57.944 --> 00:46:02.092
I mean primitive and they genetically bumped us up

931
00:46:02.092 --> 00:46:05.119
for selfish reasons to become workers.

932
00:46:05.119 --> 00:46:07.412
I always loved the term Lulus.

933
00:46:07.412 --> 00:46:08.916
<v ->Yeah, lulus, worker bees.</v>

934
00:46:08.916 --> 00:46:10.420
<v ->The human worker, yes.</v>

935
00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:14.670
And they used us as working animals for centuries

936
00:46:15.785 --> 00:46:19.090
and you know our history we tended to deify them,

937
00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:22.319
they were a form of life somewhat human like we are

938
00:46:22.319 --> 00:46:24.026
for God's sake. They were selfish,

939
00:46:24.026 --> 00:46:25.594
they had their own little agendas

940
00:46:25.594 --> 00:46:28.918
and they were hungry for gold.

941
00:46:28.918 --> 00:46:31.043
For a verity of reasons and it wasn't

942
00:46:31.043 --> 00:46:34.434
because it was a pure, pretty, yellow metal.

943
00:46:34.434 --> 00:46:35.831
<v ->Right, it wasn't for jewelry.</v>

944
00:46:35.831 --> 00:46:36.947
<v ->No, no, no, no.</v>

945
00:46:37.804 --> 00:46:40.436
Now we've learned that what they were doing is

946
00:46:40.436 --> 00:46:42.943
that they were transmuting it into what we call,

947
00:46:44.403 --> 00:46:45.506
what's the word, Ormus.

948
00:46:45.506 --> 00:46:46.786
<v ->The white gold, yeah.</v>

949
00:46:46.786 --> 00:46:48.512
<v ->The white powdered gold.</v>

950
00:46:48.512 --> 00:46:50.384
Which they ingested

951
00:46:50.384 --> 00:46:52.623
and now we have learned the power of that.

952
00:46:53.717 --> 00:46:55.288
Oh my God, if you,

953
00:46:55.288 --> 00:46:56.759
<v ->I've delved into that quite a bit.</v>

954
00:46:56.759 --> 00:46:59.478
<v ->Well if you ingest Ormus it literally can</v>

955
00:46:59.478 --> 00:47:02.441
regenerate your genome to a point where,

956
00:47:02.441 --> 00:47:06.092
not only can it extend your life almost infinity

957
00:47:07.154 --> 00:47:09.829
and some of them live apparently thousands of years,

958
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:11.418
healthfully.

959
00:47:11.418 --> 00:47:13.218
They don't get sick, they don't die.

960
00:47:14.333 --> 00:47:16.904
<v ->But it has to be used with a proper understanding</v>

961
00:47:16.904 --> 00:47:19.805
and consciousness or that's not necessarily the effect.

962
00:47:19.805 --> 00:47:21.127
<v ->Well you've done your homework.</v>

963
00:47:21.127 --> 00:47:25.723
<v ->Yeah and so the Anonoki had come,</v>

964
00:47:26.507 --> 00:47:28.374
in order to exploit the resources

965
00:47:28.374 --> 00:47:31.222
and also to bump up the intelligence

966
00:47:31.222 --> 00:47:33.399
and the capability of the existing beings

967
00:47:33.399 --> 00:47:35.648
to exploit them as workers

968
00:47:35.648 --> 00:47:39.509
and I think what you're leading to here is

969
00:47:39.509 --> 00:47:43.682
maybe there were some amends to make.

970
00:47:46.237 --> 00:47:50.855
<v ->Apparently intelligence is at the higher level,</v>

971
00:47:50.855 --> 00:47:53.719
at the highest level of hierarchy.

972
00:47:55.388 --> 00:47:56.743
Have become interested

973
00:47:56.743 --> 00:47:59.489
and now have interceded into this process.

974
00:48:00.359 --> 00:48:03.333
And they've come down on the lower levels of intelligence,

975
00:48:03.333 --> 00:48:06.595
particularly the Anonoki and I use it again generically.

976
00:48:06.595 --> 00:48:07.779
<v ->Almost as you would ET.</v>

977
00:48:07.779 --> 00:48:09.124
<v ->Yeah and they have said</v>

978
00:48:10.133 --> 00:48:11.251
"Get your act together,

979
00:48:11.251 --> 00:48:13.406
"you made a lot of mistakes along the way.

980
00:48:13.406 --> 00:48:15.582
"Now you're going to have to straighten things out

981
00:48:15.582 --> 00:48:17.185
"and you're going to have to participate.

982
00:48:18.161 --> 00:48:21.649
"In helping develop this species in this animal form

983
00:48:21.649 --> 00:48:23.686
"into a higher level, you're gonna have

984
00:48:23.686 --> 00:48:26.462
"to make amends for some of your mistakes in the past."

985
00:48:27.492 --> 00:48:31.647
And apparently they've come down with almost infinite power

986
00:48:32.494 --> 00:48:34.642
and said "This is the way it's going to be."

987
00:48:35.896 --> 00:48:37.294
<v ->The other ones are saying this,</v>

988
00:48:37.294 --> 00:48:40.803
<v ->Yes the higher levels of this hierarchy have come down</v>

989
00:48:40.803 --> 00:48:43.107
and said now get your act together

990
00:48:43.107 --> 00:48:45.790
"and correct the mistakes you've made in the past.

991
00:48:46.744 --> 00:48:50.235
"You're not going to be able to continue to use this species

992
00:48:51.553 --> 00:48:54.842
"in a selfish way. They're not here to serve you."

993
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:58.319
and that's when this program developed.

994
00:48:59.307 --> 00:49:03.189
Where we've got at least a half a dozen different groups

995
00:49:03.189 --> 00:49:05.146
now working together.

996
00:49:06.378 --> 00:49:07.616
To work and help,

997
00:49:07.616 --> 00:49:11.321
to help make that transition that we're undergoing.

998
00:49:12.309 --> 00:49:14.873
This transcendent transformation I call it.

999
00:49:16.191 --> 00:49:19.225
Into a much higher spiritual form

1000
00:49:20.212 --> 00:49:21.673
and they're working together

1001
00:49:21.673 --> 00:49:23.009
and they're all over the damn place.

1002
00:49:24.039 --> 00:49:25.884
Our remote viewers have discovered,

1003
00:49:25.884 --> 00:49:29.781
well years ago that there were four major installations.

1004
00:49:29.781 --> 00:49:32.010
Now I have learned that there are at least six.

1005
00:49:32.933 --> 00:49:34.991
<v ->And these are all underground or under the sea or?</v>

1006
00:49:36.931 --> 00:49:38.533
<v ->You can say underground, yes.</v>

1007
00:49:38.533 --> 00:49:41.381
Because they do have major underground

1008
00:49:41.381 --> 00:49:43.293
facilities all over the planet.

1009
00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:47.026
There's one inside Mount Hayes in Alaska.

1010
00:49:48.141 --> 00:49:49.985
There's one inside of the mountain

1011
00:49:49.985 --> 00:49:52.100
in the Pyrenees, Monte Perdido

1012
00:49:53.333 --> 00:49:56.834
and that installation has been there for God knows how long.

1013
00:49:57.768 --> 00:50:00.016
There's one underground in the middle of Australia,

1014
00:50:00.016 --> 00:50:01.706
near Pine Gap.

1015
00:50:01.706 --> 00:50:04.805
Interestingly enough, coincidentally enough right next

1016
00:50:04.805 --> 00:50:07.888
to one of the largest national security

1017
00:50:07.888 --> 00:50:10.106
agency facilities on the planet.

1018
00:50:10.106 --> 00:50:11.408
<v ->Eh, coincidence.</v>

1019
00:50:11.408 --> 00:50:12.873
<v ->Pine Gap</v>

1020
00:50:13.679 --> 00:50:16.133
and the ET's, I've accept that term,

1021
00:50:16.133 --> 00:50:18.581
use it in a generic sense.

1022
00:50:19.514 --> 00:50:21.315
Have a vast facility underground

1023
00:50:21.315 --> 00:50:23.452
there in the middle of Australia.

1024
00:50:24.184 --> 00:50:26.786
<v ->Did you say that there's also one that's been,</v>

1025
00:50:28.866 --> 00:50:31.557
discovered as it were in Zimbabwe?

1026
00:50:32.672 --> 00:50:35.075
<v ->Under Zimbabwe, of all places.</v>

1027
00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:38.666
I don't know Robert Mugabe has any idea

1028
00:50:38.666 --> 00:50:40.574
of what's underground in his country.

1029
00:50:40.574 --> 00:50:43.987
<v ->However listening to Michael's work, Michael Telinger,</v>

1030
00:50:43.987 --> 00:50:47.317
he believes that was the home of Inky.

1031
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:49.856
So it makes some sense here.

1032
00:50:51.259 --> 00:50:52.522
<v ->Michael,</v>

1033
00:50:57.692 --> 00:51:00.026
you have to be patient with a cigar smoker.

1034
00:51:00.026 --> 00:51:02.207
<v ->We're patient, take your time.</v>

1035
00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:05.972
<v ->Michael thinks he's discovered Inky's home.</v>

1036
00:51:05.972 --> 00:51:06.636
<v ->Yes.</v>

1037
00:51:06.636 --> 00:51:10.639
<v ->He said its Great Zimbabwe, that incredible rune there,</v>

1038
00:51:11.754 --> 00:51:13.305
which is quite impressive.

1039
00:51:14.047 --> 00:51:16.629
Now that may have been one of Inky's homes I'm sure,

1040
00:51:16.629 --> 00:51:19.010
Inky had a home where ever he wanted to have one.

1041
00:51:21.842 --> 00:51:24.402
Regine, Inky might st ill be with us, you know?

1042
00:51:25.882 --> 00:51:27.403
And that's kind of hard to swallow too.

1043
00:51:33.115 --> 00:51:35.193
<v ->Through remote viewing and otherwise,</v>

1044
00:51:35.193 --> 00:51:37.669
evidence of these bases that there are other species

1045
00:51:37.669 --> 00:51:41.027
that have been living here since the beginning really

1046
00:51:41.027 --> 00:51:43.815
and now you're saying that there has been a directive,

1047
00:51:44.983 --> 00:51:47.554
within the spiritual realms that these beings are to now

1048
00:51:47.554 --> 00:51:52.123
assist us rather than resist and try to obstruct our,

1049
00:51:54.049 --> 00:51:54.998
transformation?

1050
00:51:54.998 --> 00:51:55.830
<v ->Exactly.</v>

1051
00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:59.723
<v ->That's beautiful. Is that the thing that gives you hope?</v>

1052
00:51:59.723 --> 00:52:02.083
Because when you were speaking yesterday

1053
00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:04.480
and I've seen you before,

1054
00:52:05.457 --> 00:52:07.345
your speaking is some of the phenomena

1055
00:52:07.345 --> 00:52:08.475
that we've been exposed to,

1056
00:52:08.475 --> 00:52:10.715
which in in of itself is fascinating.

1057
00:52:10.715 --> 00:52:13.883
In fact I would suggest that anybody who can get

1058
00:52:13.883 --> 00:52:16.345
to a James's site, the East Eddie site,

1059
00:52:16.345 --> 00:52:20.310
if they have the recording of your talk yesterday,

1060
00:52:20.310 --> 00:52:21.590
your presentation yesterday

1061
00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:23.745
they should definitely try to pick up a copy.

1062
00:52:23.745 --> 00:52:27.010
To get the backstory on a lot of this in terms

1063
00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:29.067
of what you know, what you've been exposed to.

1064
00:52:29.067 --> 00:52:30.400
<v ->I'm going to have to get a copy of that</v>

1065
00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:31.947
to find out what I said yesterday.

1066
00:52:31.947 --> 00:52:33.024
<v ->You will.</v>

1067
00:52:33.024 --> 00:52:34.987
<v ->And I say this to people and they chuckle</v>

1068
00:52:34.987 --> 00:52:36.547
and I say I'm serious you know?

1069
00:52:37.641 --> 00:52:40.914
I have to get a copy of a tape and look back.

1070
00:52:40.914 --> 00:52:41.844
Did I say that?

1071
00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:44.252
<v ->You said that, I'd tell you you said that.</v>

1072
00:52:44.252 --> 00:52:45.310
<v ->Because when I'm up there,</v>

1073
00:52:46.319 --> 00:52:50.067
I told people and I confess, I tend to ramble,

1074
00:52:50.692 --> 00:52:51.866
I have a whole bunch of notes

1075
00:52:51.866 --> 00:52:53.945
and I never get through all of them.

1076
00:52:53.945 --> 00:52:55.598
<v ->I didn't see you look at them.</v>

1077
00:52:56.361 --> 00:52:57.517
<v ->Yeah I've got notes,</v>

1078
00:52:57.517 --> 00:52:58.893
I could have gone for another two hours.

1079
00:52:58.893 --> 00:53:00.663
<v ->I have notes on everything you said right</v>

1080
00:53:00.663 --> 00:53:02.274
<v ->Well shame on you.
<v Regina>It was very,</v>

1081
00:53:02.274 --> 00:53:04.524
intriguing, it was very interesting

1082
00:53:04.524 --> 00:53:06.743
and you gave us kind of the hard cold facts

1083
00:53:06.743 --> 00:53:08.385
of what's going on about the,

1084
00:53:08.385 --> 00:53:10.071
more of the explortation of the species

1085
00:53:10.071 --> 00:53:12.897
but the reality is and I know we have just a

1086
00:53:12.897 --> 00:53:15.662
few minutes left here in this conversation.

1087
00:53:16.404 --> 00:53:17.865
You've come out of this with hope

1088
00:53:17.865 --> 00:53:19.413
and that's what I'd like you to wrap this,

1089
00:53:19.413 --> 00:53:22.377
<v ->Well once I really began to understand, honey,</v>

1090
00:53:22.377 --> 00:53:25.218
that there is the physical process unfolding.

1091
00:53:26.333 --> 00:53:29.196
The biological development taking place.

1092
00:53:29.895 --> 00:53:32.992
There is a species in transit

1093
00:53:34.139 --> 00:53:36.629
but that's only this much.

1094
00:53:38.064 --> 00:53:42.176
The real story, the great story, the beautiful story is,

1095
00:53:42.854 --> 00:53:44.405
the spiritual thing you see.

1096
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:48.760
It's not the biological thing, it's not the temporary human

1097
00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:52.242
form that we take here when we incarnate here.

1098
00:53:53.112 --> 00:53:56.630
It's the growth and the development of the immortal self,

1099
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:57.468
the spirit

1100
00:53:58.684 --> 00:54:01.671
and once I began to realize that.

1101
00:54:01.671 --> 00:54:04.683
That I have lived thousands and thousands of years,

1102
00:54:05.607 --> 00:54:08.206
I reincarnated and had many hundreds

1103
00:54:08.206 --> 00:54:10.576
of thousands of lives on this planet.

1104
00:54:11.339 --> 00:54:14.199
I learned that I had also incarnated and lived thousands

1105
00:54:14.199 --> 00:54:19.148
of lives on other planets, in other star systems

1106
00:54:19.148 --> 00:54:20.893
and in other dimensions.

1107
00:54:20.893 --> 00:54:23.625
And when I began to come to the term that,

1108
00:54:23.625 --> 00:54:26.070
that I am an infinite and immortal being

1109
00:54:27.057 --> 00:54:28.678
and the universe is my home,

1110
00:54:28.678 --> 00:54:30.612
this planet is not my home.

1111
00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:33.311
The universe is my home.

1112
00:54:34.159 --> 00:54:37.231
My God, you reach a point where you,

1113
00:54:39.921 --> 00:54:42.100
you don't fear anything anymore.

1114
00:54:43.161 --> 00:54:44.330
There's no death.

1115
00:54:45.924 --> 00:54:47.230
I have no fear.

1116
00:54:48.409 --> 00:54:51.129
I'm looking forward to transitioning out

1117
00:54:51.129 --> 00:54:53.774
of this form within a year or two.

1118
00:54:53.774 --> 00:54:55.843
Whenever, whenever I finished

1119
00:54:55.843 --> 00:54:57.661
whatever the hell I came to do.

1120
00:54:58.958 --> 00:55:01.336
Yeah, I've reached a point where the only

1121
00:55:01.336 --> 00:55:04.349
thing that matters to me anymore is the spiritual issue.

1122
00:55:06.328 --> 00:55:07.960
I wanna learn, I wanna grow,

1123
00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:10.439
I want to contribute, I want to,

1124
00:55:11.597 --> 00:55:14.253
become a value not only to my species,

1125
00:55:14.253 --> 00:55:16.944
temporarily here on this tiny planet

1126
00:55:17.814 --> 00:55:20.866
but I'm interested in my position

1127
00:55:20.866 --> 00:55:23.916
as a member,

1128
00:55:23.916 --> 00:55:27.270
of that infinite form of spiritual life out there

1129
00:55:28.097 --> 00:55:30.604
and then yeah, you've reached a point, I've reached a point

1130
00:55:30.604 --> 00:55:33.944
where I have no fear and I have nothing but hope.

1131
00:55:33.944 --> 00:55:38.277
And I try to say people, you get rid of the fear

1132
00:55:39.307 --> 00:55:42.112
because this group of humans that

1133
00:55:42.112 --> 00:55:43.936
are running the power thing here.

1134
00:55:43.936 --> 00:55:46.629
What do they call it? The powers that be?

1135
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.342
And they're not as powerful as they think they are.

1136
00:55:51.531 --> 00:55:53.280
They're nuisances but a,

1137
00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:54.916
that will pass.

1138
00:55:56.597 --> 00:55:59.394
I have hope yes and I want to leave that with people

1139
00:55:59.394 --> 00:56:00.791
when I talk to them.

1140
00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:03.799
Try to step out of that fear.

1141
00:56:04.498 --> 00:56:06.455
Don't let them manipulate you.

1142
00:56:08.644 --> 00:56:11.770
Don't allow them to make you run around scared, hiding.

1143
00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:13.061
<v ->Don't give them that power.</v>

1144
00:56:13.061 --> 00:56:15.517
<v ->Don't give them that power, you got it honey.</v>

1145
00:56:17.869 --> 00:56:20.652
So yeah I leave people with a feeling of hope, I hope.

1146
00:56:20.652 --> 00:56:21.420
(chuckles)

1147
00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:23.125
No pun intended.

1148
00:56:23.126 --> 00:56:23.819
<v ->Indeed.</v>

1149
00:56:23.819 --> 00:56:26.320
<v ->Yeah, there is nothing to fear.</v>

1150
00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.459
That you are an infinite immortal being

1151
00:56:28.459 --> 00:56:31.467
and you're going through a period

1152
00:56:31.467 --> 00:56:33.765
transition here as a human being.

1153
00:56:34.357 --> 00:56:36.811
And it's painful, it's awkward and difficult

1154
00:56:36.811 --> 00:56:40.655
but beyond that,there's nothing but,

1155
00:56:42.602 --> 00:56:47.203
And I'm trying not, not trying to be humorous here

1156
00:56:48.938 --> 00:56:50.981
but all there is is God.

1157
00:56:52.351 --> 00:56:55.097
And people say "What the hell are you really talking about?"

1158
00:56:56.575 --> 00:57:00.788
and I says "Well it's not easy to try to define God."

1159
00:57:02.288 --> 00:57:06.381
and I tell them I've discovered in my short time here,

1160
00:57:07.731 --> 00:57:09.325
in my travels,

1161
00:57:10.622 --> 00:57:13.631
not just in this life, not this particular place

1162
00:57:13.631 --> 00:57:16.237
but my travels.

1163
00:57:17.139 --> 00:57:19.443
Other times, other places, other worlds, other lives.

1164
00:57:21.463 --> 00:57:22.752
There is a,

1165
00:57:25.222 --> 00:57:28.426
there is a vast conscious intelligence

1166
00:57:29.435 --> 00:57:32.074
that literally permeates the universe.

1167
00:57:33.413 --> 00:57:35.525
Now this conscious intelligence

1168
00:57:35.525 --> 00:57:38.335
is predominately spiritual.

1169
00:57:39.674 --> 00:57:40.639
It has,

1170
00:57:41.402 --> 00:57:44.099
It's a creative power, it's a creative force,

1171
00:57:46.569 --> 00:57:49.728
It generates love, compassion,

1172
00:57:53.563 --> 00:57:57.290
patience, tenderness and love.

1173
00:57:58.928 --> 00:58:01.824
This conscious intelligence is infinite

1174
00:58:03.867 --> 00:58:08.666
and we are literally immersed in an ocean

1175
00:58:08.666 --> 00:58:11.563
of this conscious intelligence.

1176
00:58:13.242 --> 00:58:16.537
And that's about as close to a definition as I can come to

1177
00:58:16.537 --> 00:58:18.548
of what I think of as God.

1178
00:58:19.524 --> 00:58:20.948
<v ->Well that's pretty wonderful.</v>

1179
00:58:21.594 --> 00:58:24.623
<v ->Well I found it to be so when I reached that point.</v>

1180
00:58:24.623 --> 00:58:28.089
Which is why I am at a point in my life temporarily,

1181
00:58:28.089 --> 00:58:29.915
that I fear nothing

1182
00:58:31.723 --> 00:58:33.680
and I try to leave that with people.

1183
00:58:35.158 --> 00:58:36.421
Don't be afraid.

1184
00:58:37.088 --> 00:58:38.874
Find out who and what you are,

1185
00:58:39.456 --> 00:58:40.597
as old Yogananda said

1186
00:58:40.597 --> 00:58:42.757
"Look within and find that self."

1187
00:58:43.809 --> 00:58:47.327
And I also like to refer to that inscription above

1188
00:58:47.327 --> 00:58:50.703
the temple entrance at Delfy.

1189
00:58:52.244 --> 00:58:54.276
Man know thy self.

1190
00:58:56.095 --> 00:58:57.790
And as yogananda tried to point out

1191
00:58:57.790 --> 00:59:00.735
that was Hindu concept of the self,

1192
00:59:00.735 --> 00:59:02.745
was the immortal at man.

1193
00:59:04.553 --> 00:59:07.704
The infinite being that we really are

1194
00:59:08.915 --> 00:59:10.776
and when you get to that point

1195
00:59:11.454 --> 00:59:15.405
and I've reached it, I have no fear at all.

1196
00:59:16.392 --> 00:59:20.994
Matter of fact there is a level of bliss and joy in me now.

1197
00:59:21.918 --> 00:59:24.317
You might find it hard to find once and a while

1198
00:59:24.317 --> 00:59:27.026
I'm sipping my bourbon and puffing my big cigars

1199
00:59:27.026 --> 00:59:30.578
but I have a feeling within that is just,

1200
00:59:30.578 --> 00:59:34.418
overwhelmingly joyous and blissful and peaceful.

1201
00:59:35.688 --> 00:59:37.072
<v ->It shows.</v>

1202
00:59:37.072 --> 00:59:38.507
<v ->And I try to share that.</v>

1203
00:59:39.356 --> 00:59:41.190
<v ->People feel that in you and I think that's why</v>

1204
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:45.190
there's such deep respect for what you've been through

1205
00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:47.613
and for the words you share with people.

1206
00:59:47.613 --> 00:59:50.214
And on that I think we probably

1207
00:59:50.214 --> 00:59:52.909
have just seconds of tape left here.

1208
00:59:52.909 --> 00:59:54.875
I wanna thank you so much for taking time,

1209
00:59:54.875 --> 00:59:56.314
I know it's been a hectic weekend.

1210
00:59:56.314 --> 00:59:58.610
<v ->Regina, thank you honey, it's been my pleasure.</v>

1211
00:59:59.395 --> 01:00:01.283
It's always a joy to chat with you

1212
01:00:01.283 --> 01:00:03.367
and thank you for being patient.

1213
01:00:04.292 --> 01:00:06.811
Because I'm at a point where I find,

1214
01:00:06.811 --> 01:00:09.078
find words are simply not sufficient

1215
01:00:09.078 --> 01:00:10.544
to what I want to express.

1216
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:13.685
<v ->Well you shared them with us in a very elegant fashion</v>

1217
01:00:13.685 --> 01:00:15.168
and thank you so much.

1218
01:00:15.924 --> 01:00:17.590
<v ->Words just don't do it.</v>

1219
01:00:17.590 --> 01:00:18.933
<v ->They don't!</v>

1220
01:00:18.933 --> 01:00:20.695
<v ->But I give it a try</v>

1221
01:00:20.695 --> 01:00:23.728
and people apparently respond positively.

1222
01:00:24.736 --> 01:00:26.309
And to me that's very gratifying,

1223
01:00:27.275 --> 01:00:29.451
to have people come up and give me hugs and kisses

1224
01:00:29.451 --> 01:00:31.157
and shake my hand and say thank you

1225
01:00:31.157 --> 01:00:32.683
and I think "For what?"

1226
01:00:34.123 --> 01:00:34.746
Cause I'm not,

1227
01:00:34.746 --> 01:00:37.844
I haven't told you anything that you don't already know.

1228
01:00:39.546 --> 01:00:41.925
I touch them and I say

1229
01:00:41.925 --> 01:00:45.563
"All I have done is remind you of who you are

1230
01:00:45.563 --> 01:00:50.093
"and what you are, that I have given you anything

1231
01:00:50.093 --> 01:00:51.942
"that you don't already have."

1232
01:00:53.123 --> 01:00:55.479
And I refer to the old Hindu tradition

1233
01:00:55.479 --> 01:00:57.409
where the Guru would come up and,

1234
01:00:57.409 --> 01:01:00.311
Knock the young student in the forehead,

1235
01:01:00.311 --> 01:01:02.127
right between his third eye

1236
01:01:03.029 --> 01:01:04.644
and he wakes up!

1237
01:01:05.087 --> 01:01:07.850
Well when I touch people and they speak to me

1238
01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:09.240
and I say "Wake up!"

1239
01:01:11.402 --> 01:01:13.113
Man know thy self.

1240
01:01:17.481 --> 01:01:18.985
<v ->If you enjoyed this conversation,</v>

1241
01:01:18.985 --> 01:01:21.118
you might also enjoy my first interview with Bob,

1242
01:01:21.118 --> 01:01:22.825
which you can find on this site.

1243
01:01:22.825 --> 01:01:24.692
His information is complimented by the work of

1244
01:01:24.692 --> 01:01:26.868
James Gililand and Alfred Weber,

1245
01:01:26.868 --> 01:01:29.406
both of whom I've interview on a couple of occasions.

1246
01:01:29.406 --> 01:01:31.359
You can find all these interviews here,

1247
01:01:31.359 --> 01:01:33.588
until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
