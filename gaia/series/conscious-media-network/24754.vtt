00:00:01.005 --> 00:00:02.583
<v ->While many of us spend our time</v>

2
00:00:02.583 --> 00:00:05.472
digging to the depths of one subject after another,

3
00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:07.445
putting they mysteries of life together,

4
00:00:07.445 --> 00:00:10.561
it's often the most simple and obvious aspects of our lives

5
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:13.456
that trip us up, like human relationships.

6
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.129
This is Benig Mauger's territory.

7
00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.686
Suffering from a broken heart,

8
00:00:17.686 --> 00:00:19.638
she corralled her energy and talents

9
00:00:19.638 --> 00:00:24.022
as a union psychotherapist to produce a lovely guide to love

10
00:00:24.022 --> 00:00:26.251
called Love in the Time of a Broken Heart.

11
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:29.269
This book speaks of the universal search for love

12
00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.708
and the beauty of what happens when love breaks down.

13
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.207 line:15% 
(inspirational music)

14
00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:40.767
<v Voiceover>If there's a single person watching this</v>

15
00:00:40.767 --> 00:00:43.508
that has not experienced a broken heart

16
00:00:43.508 --> 00:00:46.015
at one time or another and what it takes us through,

17
00:00:46.015 --> 00:00:49.375
and you very carefully delineate

18
00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:52.233
the experience of having a broken heart,

19
00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:54.974
and it really takes us to the mat, as they say.

20
00:00:54.974 --> 00:00:58.857
And, let's start with what sets us up

21
00:00:58.857 --> 00:01:00.832
for the broken heart to begin with?

22
00:01:00.832 --> 00:01:02.986
And looking at early childhood patterns

23
00:01:02.986 --> 00:01:05.166
or familial patterns, for example.

24
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.409
<v ->Hmm, well I think that, as you say,</v>

25
00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.375
most of us will have, at some stage in our lives,

26
00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:11.932
will experience a broken heart,

27
00:01:11.932 --> 00:01:14.176
and, as you know from reading the book, it's...

28
00:01:14.226 --> 00:01:16.806
I see it as not a bad thing, It's a transformational thing.

29
00:01:16.806 --> 00:01:17.517
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

30
00:01:18.427 --> 00:01:21.470
I think that important thing here is

31
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.192
that we do repeat patterns.

32
00:01:24.782 --> 00:01:29.751
We repeat patterns that are kind of familiar.

33
00:01:30.088 --> 00:01:34.270
We also have, as women, we have an animus,

34
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.096
which is based on our image of our fathers,

35
00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:38.515
and men have an anima,

36
00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:41.666
which is based on their relationship with their mothers.

37
00:01:41.907 --> 00:01:45.058
So, being the first male and female in our lives,

38
00:01:45.203 --> 00:01:49.213
and they create, uh...

39
00:01:49.213 --> 00:01:54.092
they create the inner images of the masculine and feminine.

40
00:01:54.162 --> 00:01:57.735
So when we go out there, and we're attracted to

41
00:01:57.735 --> 00:02:01.852
partners of the opposite sex, in this case, then,

42
00:02:01.852 --> 00:02:05.067
usually, we are projecting onto these partners,

43
00:02:05.782 --> 00:02:07.802
something that needs healing in ours...

44
00:02:07.802 --> 00:02:09.673
Something that we feel we haven't got.

45
00:02:09.893 --> 00:02:11.375
'Cause you know yourself, when you fall in love

46
00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:13.796
you fall in love with something in the other person,

47
00:02:13.796 --> 00:02:18.361
quality in the other person, that you feel attracted to,

48
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:21.220
and when we do that, we're usually repeating patterns,

49
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.219
and we're also healing emotional wounds from childhood,

50
00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.413
though we don't know it.

51
00:02:25.413 --> 00:02:26.266
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm.</v>

52
00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:28.336
Let's look at a couple of common, or classical,

53
00:02:28.336 --> 00:02:31.951
examples of how, as, let's start with the women,

54
00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:35.439
how we would project, essentially,

55
00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.199
our native relationship with our father,

56
00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:38.458
onto another partner,

57
00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.666
and then, ultimately, lead ourselves to this

58
00:02:40.666 --> 00:02:42.937
place of devastation in some cases.

59
00:02:42.937 --> 00:02:45.188
<v ->Yeah, ok, well, let's say that we have an exp...</v>

60
00:02:45.188 --> 00:02:47.076
and it might not always be fathers, either.

61
00:02:47.076 --> 00:02:50.432
Let's say we have an experience of abandonment

62
00:02:50.586 --> 00:02:51.855
at some point.

63
00:02:51.855 --> 00:02:55.109
And it could be that we were separated at birth

64
00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:56.997
from our mothers,

65
00:02:56.997 --> 00:03:00.465
or we could feel that our fathers were never there for us,

66
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:02.745
and we have this hunger to relate

67
00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:04.766
to the masculine in some way.

68
00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.610
Then we will generally choose, unconsciously,

69
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.295
'cause it's the power of the unconscious,

70
00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:13.987
(stammers) a partner who will be destined,

71
00:03:13.987 --> 00:03:18.022
at some level, to betray us, to repeat the pattern,

72
00:03:18.167 --> 00:03:20.582
because the psyche always seeks healing,

73
00:03:20.983 --> 00:03:23.905
and it does that through bringing in

74
00:03:23.905 --> 00:03:26.743
relationships and events into our lives

75
00:03:26.743 --> 00:03:29.403
to give us the opportunity to heal the first wound.

76
00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:30.966
<v Voiceover>And when you say, "betray us,"</v>

77
00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:34.153
that doesn't necessarily mean literally abandon us,

78
00:03:34.153 --> 00:03:35.497
although it could lead to that.

79
00:03:35.497 --> 00:03:36.500
Mm-hmm
<v Voiceover>It could</v>

80
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.705
mean betrayal on a number of levels.

81
00:03:37.705 --> 00:03:39.262
Let's take the abandonment issue and play that out.

82
00:03:39.262 --> 00:03:40.404
What are some of the ways in which

83
00:03:40.404 --> 00:03:42.281
the betrayals can show itself that will

84
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:44.926
push those same buttons without a literal abandonment?

85
00:03:44.926 --> 00:03:49.064
<v ->Ok, well, (stammers) we might feel</v>

86
00:03:49.064 --> 00:03:51.117
that we're not getting enough love.

87
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.096
You never tell me you love me,

88
00:03:53.096 --> 00:03:55.048
or I don't feel that you really love me,

89
00:03:55.048 --> 00:03:56.147
and the more...

90
00:03:56.147 --> 00:03:58.101
or, every time the man goes out,

91
00:03:58.551 --> 00:04:00.204
did you meet someone else?

92
00:04:00.228 --> 00:04:03.897
You know, we have a fear, so we create these situations

93
00:04:03.897 --> 00:04:06.734
because that pushes the person away, doesn't it?

94
00:04:06.734 --> 00:04:07.822
The more you want something,

95
00:04:07.822 --> 00:04:09.123
the more the other person's going to move.

96
00:04:09.123 --> 00:04:10.254
It's like a dance,

97
00:04:10.254 --> 00:04:11.278
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm</v>
<v Benig>you know.</v>

98
00:04:12.108 --> 00:04:16.871
And, ultimately, we may say, we may push the person away.

99
00:04:16.996 --> 00:04:18.692
Because of our fear of abandonment.

100
00:04:18.692 --> 00:04:21.337
Because we're recreating it, do you know?

101
00:04:21.337 --> 00:04:22.307
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.</v>

102
00:04:22.307 --> 00:04:23.961
<v ->But it could take several stages, of course,</v>

103
00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:25.187
'cause the person might get fed up

104
00:04:25.187 --> 00:04:26.510
and say, "Listen, I don't want to stay with you,

105
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.672
"you're so insecure."
<v Voiceover>And it's a</v>

106
00:04:27.672 --> 00:04:28.739
self-fulfilling prophecy,

107
00:04:28.739 --> 00:04:29.897
they'll abandon you
<v Benig>Yeah, yeah,</v>

108
00:04:29.897 --> 00:04:31.286
That's right, exactly.
<v Voiceover>Of course.</v>

109
00:04:31.286 --> 00:04:31.905
Yes.

110
00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:33.611
Now, when you're writing the book,

111
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:37.612
you're a great, I wouldn't say fan,

112
00:04:37.612 --> 00:04:41.420
you use union psychology at the base of all of this,

113
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.260
and so you also use archetypal characters and such

114
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.948
that we can relate to in the journey, right?

115
00:04:47.948 --> 00:04:50.294
And we're talking about the Aphrodite character,

116
00:04:50.294 --> 00:04:51.638
and the Psyche character.
<v Benig>Yes.</v>

117
00:04:51.638 --> 00:04:53.494
<v Voiceover>And let's talk about that for a moment,</v>

118
00:04:53.494 --> 00:04:55.009
the basic archetypes.

119
00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:56.491
Because you say we need to...

120
00:04:56.491 --> 00:04:58.539
and your book is wonderful, it's an actual workbook,

121
00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.416
where you can go through and identify

122
00:05:00.416 --> 00:05:03.872
all of these particular constituents of your own life,

123
00:05:03.872 --> 00:05:07.776
be it family, and your own patterns of thought,

124
00:05:07.776 --> 00:05:09.450
and your own archetype and so forth.

125
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.837
Let's start with the archetype.

126
00:05:10.837 --> 00:05:13.770
Which are the primary archetypes you're looking at?

127
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.202
<v ->Well, uh, with, (stammers) as we...</v>

128
00:05:16.202 --> 00:05:18.506
We have many archetypal influences in our lives,

129
00:05:18.506 --> 00:05:19.732
but there are four,

130
00:05:19.732 --> 00:05:22.378
and Carolyn Myss was the first person to talk about this.

131
00:05:22.378 --> 00:05:24.468
There are four basic archetypes

132
00:05:24.468 --> 00:05:26.281
that live with us and walk with us.

133
00:05:26.281 --> 00:05:30.324
There's the inner child, which most people know about.

134
00:05:30.324 --> 00:05:33.065
There's the inner saboteur,

135
00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:35.966
the inner prostitute, which is not as bad as it sounds,

136
00:05:35.966 --> 00:05:37.339
by the way, 'cause, as you know,

137
00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:38.813
at the end of the book there's a beautiful...

138
00:05:38.813 --> 00:05:40.117
There's a lot of stories in the book.

139
00:05:40.117 --> 00:05:40.984
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

140
00:05:40.984 --> 00:05:44.332
<v ->And theres the inner, umm, what's the...</v>

141
00:05:44.332 --> 00:05:45.602
the inner victim.

142
00:05:45.602 --> 00:05:48.929
So, the inner child is very active.

143
00:05:48.929 --> 00:05:51.276
When, in love relationships, often,

144
00:05:51.276 --> 00:05:53.825
if it's a wounded inner child that we have.

145
00:05:53.825 --> 00:05:58.825
And what happens is that it recreates...

146
00:05:59.212 --> 00:06:01.835
That energy within us will emerge,

147
00:06:01.835 --> 00:06:04.673
or will become awakened in situations

148
00:06:04.673 --> 00:06:06.038
of close relationships.

149
00:06:06.038 --> 00:06:08.171
Relationships offer us the greatest opportunity

150
00:06:08.171 --> 00:06:09.568
for spiritual growth.

151
00:06:09.568 --> 00:06:10.495
<v Voicover>Mm-hmm,</v>
<v Benig>They really do.</v>

152
00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:11.261
<v Voicover>absolutely.</v>

153
00:06:11.261 --> 00:06:13.189
<v ->And with each relationship, we grow.</v>

154
00:06:13.293 --> 00:06:16.727
You know, I have also had two divorces,

155
00:06:16.727 --> 00:06:19.810
so I know a bit about relationships,

156
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.415
and what happens and what you project onto them.

157
00:06:24.205 --> 00:06:26.696
The saboteur part of us will...

158
00:06:26.696 --> 00:06:29.043
is the bit that will be self-destructive,

159
00:06:29.043 --> 00:06:31.272
and will do the pushing away or

160
00:06:31.272 --> 00:06:33.309
will create situations with the partner,

161
00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:35.496
will feel, (gasps) you know, I don't know what to do.

162
00:06:35.496 --> 00:06:37.032
Now, it happens on both sides,

163
00:06:37.032 --> 00:06:38.045
not just on one side.

164
00:06:38.045 --> 00:06:40.114
So what the book does is kind of

165
00:06:40.114 --> 00:06:42.109
give you a chance to look in there

166
00:06:42.109 --> 00:06:44.061
and do a bit of inner soul work.

167
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:47.452
About, well, what am I, what am I bringing to this?

168
00:06:47.452 --> 00:06:51.751
You know, like my father, (stammers) myself, I...

169
00:06:51.751 --> 00:06:54.806
The book is very, is very...

170
00:06:55.228 --> 00:06:57.414
It's probably my most personal book, as well,

171
00:06:57.414 --> 00:06:59.964
so I use myself also, and my own experience.

172
00:06:59.964 --> 00:07:01.515
But my father was a very...

173
00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:04.829
Is, God bless him, he's still with us, he's 97.

174
00:07:04.829 --> 00:07:09.829
So, um, but he was very gifted, intellectually.

175
00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:13.746
He was a man of writing, a man of ideas,

176
00:07:13.746 --> 00:07:15.858
but not so good emotionally connecting.

177
00:07:15.858 --> 00:07:17.927
So what, let's say I would have chosen partners

178
00:07:17.927 --> 00:07:20.097
that I would have been attracted to their minds.

179
00:07:20.572 --> 00:07:22.774
But, at the same time, I would have missed something.

180
00:07:23.398 --> 00:07:24.241
You know?

181
00:07:24.241 --> 00:07:28.166
So the saboteur in a situation like that

182
00:07:28.166 --> 00:07:32.149
will kind of recreate that situation.

183
00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:35.686
And then we might attract someone into our lives

184
00:07:35.686 --> 00:07:38.565
that wants to make a commitment to us,

185
00:07:38.565 --> 00:07:40.635
but the part of us that feels unworthy,

186
00:07:40.635 --> 00:07:42.885
and we don't even know that we feel that sometimes,

187
00:07:42.885 --> 00:07:44.575
will push that person away.

188
00:07:44.583 --> 00:07:45.921
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm.</v>

189
00:07:46.673 --> 00:07:50.300
So when we look at these patterns of behavior,

190
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.198
and, again, I'm coming from the feminine lens.

191
00:07:52.198 --> 00:07:53.457
Because we're both women,

192
00:07:53.457 --> 00:07:54.588
it's kind of an easy place to go

193
00:07:54.588 --> 00:07:55.590
in a half an hour interview,

194
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.659
but these principles apply to men as well.

195
00:07:57.659 --> 00:07:58.449
<v ->Yes.</v>

196
00:07:58.449 --> 00:07:59.675
<v Voiceover>But looking at the notion</v>

197
00:07:59.675 --> 00:08:03.579
that we're to be completely self-sufficient

198
00:08:03.579 --> 00:08:06.064
and independent, that's what the times call for,

199
00:08:06.064 --> 00:08:09.307
and yet, at the same time, be completely present

200
00:08:09.307 --> 00:08:12.208
and open to deep connection.

201
00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:15.813
This creates a lot of mixed signals to people today.

202
00:08:15.813 --> 00:08:17.509
<v ->I think it does, and the reason is</v>

203
00:08:17.509 --> 00:08:20.058
because we have yet to establish a model

204
00:08:20.058 --> 00:08:22.559
which combines vulnerability with strength.

205
00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:23.802
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

206
00:08:23.802 --> 00:08:24.655
<v ->You know?</v>

207
00:08:24.655 --> 00:08:27.770
So that, uh, it's at one level, as you say,

208
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.116
we're taught to be self-reliant

209
00:08:30.116 --> 00:08:31.759
and not to depend on anyone,

210
00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:34.734
but at another level, we're not in our hearts,

211
00:08:34.734 --> 00:08:36.100
we're not in our vulnerabilities.

212
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.404
So what it takes, really, is

213
00:08:38.404 --> 00:08:41.125
the willingness to go the distance.

214
00:08:41.125 --> 00:08:42.628
The willingness to endure,

215
00:08:42.628 --> 00:08:46.996
and the willingness to do the inner work.

216
00:08:47.396 --> 00:08:48.271
You know.
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

217
00:08:48.271 --> 00:08:49.743
Because there is a tendency, I think,

218
00:08:49.743 --> 00:08:51.151
and I think you'll agree with me,

219
00:08:51.151 --> 00:08:54.009
in our modern society, in the west, particularly,

220
00:08:54.009 --> 00:08:56.420
to kind of have instant gratification.

221
00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.913
Ok, if that doesn't work right,

222
00:08:57.913 --> 00:08:59.630
I'll go on, I'll get someone else, you know.

223
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.525
I mean, you know, you're not who I thought you were.

224
00:09:02.649 --> 00:09:04.782
So that's it, I'm going to go out and find this person.

225
00:09:04.782 --> 00:09:06.340
But it doesn't work like that.

226
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.620
<v Voiceover>Because don't you end up</v>

227
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.033
confronting yourself again, and the same issues again?

228
00:09:11.033 --> 00:09:14.440
<v ->Exactly, unless you're willing to look within,</v>

229
00:09:14.606 --> 00:09:15.859
and to...

230
00:09:16.217 --> 00:09:18.585
And, in fact, as you know, the book is called

231
00:09:18.585 --> 00:09:20.067
Love in the Time of Broken Hearts,

232
00:09:20.067 --> 00:09:23.107
so it's dealing with what happens

233
00:09:23.107 --> 00:09:25.710
when the relationship breaks down and you're alone.

234
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:28.398
But you've been given a huge opportunity

235
00:09:28.398 --> 00:09:30.002
to come back to yourself.

236
00:09:30.115 --> 00:09:32.771
<v Voiceover>As you say, a broken heart actually can,</v>

237
00:09:32.771 --> 00:09:35.394
if we choose to be conscious through this experience,

238
00:09:35.394 --> 00:09:37.506
can lead us to the greatest wholeness

239
00:09:37.506 --> 00:09:38.872
within.
<v Benig>Absolutely.</v>

240
00:09:38.872 --> 00:09:40.109
Absolutely, yes.

241
00:09:40.109 --> 00:09:41.378
<v Voiceover>And along this journey,</v>

242
00:09:41.378 --> 00:09:42.701
you say there, again, there are things

243
00:09:42.701 --> 00:09:44.653
we have to identify in order to be able to

244
00:09:44.653 --> 00:09:46.210
find our way back to wholeness and...

245
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.770
What do you mean by identifying patterns

246
00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.244
and identifying your story?

247
00:09:51.244 --> 00:09:54.353
<v ->Ok, well, that's something that's, um...</v>

248
00:09:54.753 --> 00:09:56.865
It emerged as I was writing the book.

249
00:09:57.735 --> 00:10:01.168
In terms of a new (stammers)...

250
00:10:01.168 --> 00:10:03.536
work that needs to be continued a little bit.

251
00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:08.464
But, basically, we create our own birth myth.

252
00:10:08.464 --> 00:10:09.754
We create our own story.

253
00:10:09.754 --> 00:10:11.365
We are born with,

254
00:10:11.365 --> 00:10:13.381
because of the archetypal predispositions,

255
00:10:13.381 --> 00:10:17.460
we are born with preexisting kind of...

256
00:10:17.999 --> 00:10:22.041
We are predisposed to experience life in a particular way.

257
00:10:22.041 --> 00:10:23.919
<v Voiceover>Do you mean, again, as in these archetypes,</v>

258
00:10:23.919 --> 00:10:24.942
<v ->Yes, I do.
<v Voiceover>like a victim,</v>

259
00:10:24.942 --> 00:10:26.500
as the victim or what, and saboteur?

260
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.196
<v ->Well, also the family history.</v>

261
00:10:28.196 --> 00:10:29.358
<v Voiceover>And the family history, yes.</v>

262
00:10:29.358 --> 00:10:30.681
<v ->You see, that's the vital thing.</v>

263
00:10:30.681 --> 00:10:31.609
Because the mother...

264
00:10:31.609 --> 00:10:32.974
When you're mother's womb,

265
00:10:32.974 --> 00:10:35.022
you are picking up all the fa...

266
00:10:35.022 --> 00:10:36.664
You've got all the history of the family,

267
00:10:36.664 --> 00:10:38.947
the history of how women are in the family,

268
00:10:38.947 --> 00:10:41.155
any of the wounds that are there,

269
00:10:41.685 --> 00:10:43.591
the interaction between mother and father,

270
00:10:43.591 --> 00:10:44.658
all of that.

271
00:10:44.658 --> 00:10:49.443
So, um, so you come in and you may...

272
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:51.870
I tell you how you find out,

273
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.331
because people will say, "Well, how do I know?

274
00:10:53.331 --> 00:10:55.422
"How do you find out your story?"

275
00:10:55.422 --> 00:10:59.368
If you find that you resonate with a particular story,

276
00:10:59.368 --> 00:11:03.080
like Cinderella or, in my case, it was The Little Mermaid,

277
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.568
or Rapunzel, and there are lots of male ones as well,

278
00:11:06.568 --> 00:11:09.330
then that will give you a clue.

279
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.741
If it resonates with you when you were a child

280
00:11:11.741 --> 00:11:13.063
and you loved it,

281
00:11:13.063 --> 00:11:15.960
it will give you a clue as to what

282
00:11:16.617 --> 00:11:21.282
archetypal energy you're living out,

283
00:11:21.662 --> 00:11:23.027
and if you believe...

284
00:11:23.027 --> 00:11:25.347
See, while we're employed in our story,

285
00:11:25.652 --> 00:11:28.574
we're not open to the transcendent power of love

286
00:11:28.574 --> 00:11:30.505
because it's employed by the story.

287
00:11:30.505 --> 00:11:33.214
So, for example, and in the book it's...

288
00:11:33.214 --> 00:11:34.494
there's a lot of stories,

289
00:11:34.494 --> 00:11:37.194
I identified with the Little Mermaid.

290
00:11:37.194 --> 00:11:38.421
<v Voiceover>I was just going to ask,</v>

291
00:11:38.421 --> 00:11:39.498
"What does that mean?"

292
00:11:39.498 --> 00:11:40.703
<v ->And, The Little Mermaid, as you know,</v>

293
00:11:40.703 --> 00:11:42.282
is the story of impossible love.

294
00:11:42.282 --> 00:11:44.650
I mean, she falls in love with the prince,

295
00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:46.250
but she (stammers)

296
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:47.508
the message there is,

297
00:11:47.508 --> 00:11:49.737
you can't get this without giving in,

298
00:11:49.737 --> 00:11:52.073
giving up your most precious possession,

299
00:11:52.073 --> 00:11:53.289
your voice.

300
00:11:53.289 --> 00:11:56.489
So at a deep psychological level,

301
00:11:56.489 --> 00:12:00.201
it's about the failure, in this case,

302
00:12:00.201 --> 00:12:03.571
or the need to emerge from the maternal,

303
00:12:04.591 --> 00:12:05.807
from childhood.

304
00:12:05.807 --> 00:12:06.628
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

305
00:12:06.628 --> 00:12:10.937
<v ->Because, in fairy stories, the man,</v>

306
00:12:10.937 --> 00:12:12.847
the prince, has to find the princess,

307
00:12:12.847 --> 00:12:15.492
the king has to find the queen, etcetera, etcetera,

308
00:12:15.492 --> 00:12:17.657
and they represent our counterpart.

309
00:12:17.657 --> 00:12:19.438
Like the prince in The Little Mermaid

310
00:12:19.438 --> 00:12:21.806
is her inner man, which will in...

311
00:12:21.806 --> 00:12:23.225
her inner...

312
00:12:23.225 --> 00:12:25.912
other half, which will enable her to come to wholeness

313
00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:27.898
and emerge an adult woman.

314
00:12:27.898 --> 00:12:28.687
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

315
00:12:28.687 --> 00:12:29.380
<v ->Do you see?</v>

316
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.127
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

317
00:12:30.127 --> 00:12:32.260
<v ->So, in The Little Mermaid, it's terribly sad</v>

318
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.287
and, you know, it's so...

319
00:12:34.287 --> 00:12:36.025
If you identify with that,

320
00:12:36.025 --> 00:12:39.952
then maybe you are thinking that love is impossible,

321
00:12:39.952 --> 00:12:41.733
and I'll never find it.

322
00:12:41.733 --> 00:12:42.853
<v Voiceover>And you think that</v>

323
00:12:42.853 --> 00:12:43.962
you had a lot of that in you?

324
00:12:43.962 --> 00:12:45.893
<v ->I, definitely, most definitely,</v>

325
00:12:45.893 --> 00:12:47.098
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v Benig>absolutely.</v>

326
00:12:47.098 --> 00:12:48.378
<v Voiceover>What about Sleeping Beauty?</v>

327
00:12:48.378 --> 00:12:50.906
<v ->Sleeping Beauty is another one, she...</v>

328
00:12:50.906 --> 00:12:51.791
Is that yours?

329
00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:52.857
(Benig laughs)
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

330
00:12:52.857 --> 00:12:54.180
I really loved that,
<v Benig>Yes.</v>

331
00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.855
<v Voiceover>I identified with Sleeping Beauty.</v>

332
00:12:55.855 --> 00:12:57.870
<v Benig>Well, the Sleeping, the Sleeping Beauty,</v>

333
00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:59.684
also is...

334
00:12:59.684 --> 00:13:02.100
she's waiting for...

335
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:04.911
She's unconscious.

336
00:13:04.911 --> 00:13:08.529
So she's waiting for the prince to wake her up.

337
00:13:08.529 --> 00:13:09.414
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

338
00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:11.387
<v ->So she's not, um...</v>

339
00:13:11.387 --> 00:13:13.735
There's a tendency, with the Sleeping Beauty,

340
00:13:13.735 --> 00:13:15.357
not to actually do the work.

341
00:13:15.357 --> 00:13:16.445
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm.</v>

342
00:13:16.445 --> 00:13:18.877
She wants to remain, she remains unconscious.

343
00:13:18.877 --> 00:13:20.669
There's also more, it's more complicated there,

344
00:13:20.669 --> 00:13:22.802
because there's also the witch,

345
00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:23.591
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

346
00:13:23.591 --> 00:13:25.309
<v ->who would represent the negative feminine.</v>

347
00:13:25.309 --> 00:13:26.130
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

348
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:27.282
<v ->You know, or the devouring mother.</v>

349
00:13:27.282 --> 00:13:28.423
Same in Snow White,

350
00:13:28.423 --> 00:13:30.396
there's the stepmother and there's the jealousy.

351
00:13:30.396 --> 00:13:31.655
That's the huge thing,

352
00:13:31.655 --> 00:13:33.511
jealousy between mothers and daughters.

353
00:13:33.511 --> 00:13:35.185
And so there's...

354
00:13:35.185 --> 00:13:38.993
All the stories have very rich (stammers)

355
00:13:38.993 --> 00:13:43.494
very rich material to look at.

356
00:13:43.494 --> 00:13:44.934
And sometimes people identify,

357
00:13:44.934 --> 00:13:46.374
not with the even fairy story,

358
00:13:46.374 --> 00:13:49.019
but just with certain film stars or...

359
00:13:49.019 --> 00:13:49.830
Excuse me.

360
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:50.736
<v Voiceover>In certain roles,</v>

361
00:13:50.736 --> 00:13:51.718
certain film roles,
<v Benig>Yes.</v>

362
00:13:51.718 --> 00:13:53.104
<v Voiceover>characters in books and</v>

363
00:13:53.104 --> 00:13:54.448
novels and films.
<v Benig>Yes.</v>

364
00:13:54.448 --> 00:13:55.131
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

365
00:13:55.131 --> 00:13:56.912
<v ->And from an archetypal perspective,</v>

366
00:13:56.912 --> 00:13:59.681
if you identify with the goddess Aphrodite,

367
00:14:00.007 --> 00:14:02.215
you would be identified with beauty

368
00:14:02.215 --> 00:14:04.679
and you would be very taken up by

369
00:14:04.679 --> 00:14:06.716
things to do with physical beauty

370
00:14:06.716 --> 00:14:08.828
and romance and sexuality,

371
00:14:08.828 --> 00:14:11.505
and you might identify with Marilyn Monroe or,

372
00:14:11.505 --> 00:14:13.681
you know, whoever it is.

373
00:14:14.861 --> 00:14:17.471
And it's fun, because, you know, it's normal,

374
00:14:17.471 --> 00:14:18.954
and we all do it.

375
00:14:18.954 --> 00:14:20.042
(Benig laughs)
<v Voiceover>Yes, yes.</v>

376
00:14:20.042 --> 00:14:23.295
But you say that in beginning to understand

377
00:14:23.295 --> 00:14:25.684
these characters that we're attracted to,

378
00:14:25.684 --> 00:14:28.084
we can start seeing our own vulnerabilities

379
00:14:28.084 --> 00:14:30.772
and the holes in our own development and learning.

380
00:14:30.772 --> 00:14:32.883
<v ->Yeah, in the book, when I...</v>

381
00:14:32.883 --> 00:14:34.441
in the chapters that deal with that,

382
00:14:34.441 --> 00:14:36.158
at the end of the chapter, I say,

383
00:14:37.178 --> 00:14:39.252
"So what story are you living out of?

384
00:14:39.252 --> 00:14:43.454
"Begin, take a piece of paper and begin the story.

385
00:14:43.454 --> 00:14:45.214
"Once upon a time there was..."

386
00:14:45.214 --> 00:14:46.932
You know, a little boy, a little girl, whatever.

387
00:14:46.932 --> 00:14:50.462
And it means that you're dialoging with your inner soul,

388
00:14:50.462 --> 00:14:52.318
And it means that you're dialoging with your unconscious.

389
00:14:52.318 --> 00:14:53.992
<v Voiceover>Yes, and that's extremely effective.</v>

390
00:14:53.992 --> 00:14:54.643
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

391
00:14:54.643 --> 00:14:55.550
<v Voiceover>To look back on that,</v>

392
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.640
if one's really in a truly open and reflective place,

393
00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.936
and to see these myths that we're still holding onto.

394
00:15:00.936 --> 00:15:03.304
For example, if we have not done the work, yes.

395
00:15:03.304 --> 00:15:04.925
<v ->Yeah, and it's not about, you know,</v>

396
00:15:04.925 --> 00:15:07.410
it's not about getting rid of these things.

397
00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:09.799
It's more about becoming conscious of them.

398
00:15:09.799 --> 00:15:11.549
Like, there'll probably be a part of me

399
00:15:11.549 --> 00:15:14.098
that'll always be a bit of a little mermaid, really.

400
00:15:14.098 --> 00:15:18.631
But, at the same time, I think I've, you know,

401
00:15:18.631 --> 00:15:21.457
I think I probably occasionally wear the fins.

402
00:15:21.457 --> 00:15:23.996
But I would not be...

403
00:15:23.996 --> 00:15:25.457
go the whole distance now,

404
00:15:25.457 --> 00:15:27.473
because, you know, it's not going to work out.

405
00:15:27.473 --> 00:15:29.265
<v Voiceover>Right, right, right, exactly.</v>

406
00:15:29.265 --> 00:15:30.513
So, you, no...

407
00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:32.603
But it's also about, actually,

408
00:15:32.603 --> 00:15:34.715
I know this sounds a bit corny and and things,

409
00:15:34.715 --> 00:15:37.808
but it's also about, when you have enough self love,

410
00:15:37.808 --> 00:15:40.059
when you come to that place of wholeness,

411
00:15:40.059 --> 00:15:44.581
you will naturally attract somebody who's equally

412
00:15:44.581 --> 00:15:47.322
at the same place as you, you know?

413
00:15:47.322 --> 00:15:51.408
Because you won't be playing out the old patterns again.

414
00:15:51.408 --> 00:15:53.061
<v Voiceover>Right, the charge isn't there,</v>

415
00:15:53.061 --> 00:15:55.962
the need for attracting the opposite charge,

416
00:15:55.962 --> 00:15:57.796
so to speak, too, as a mirror.

417
00:15:57.796 --> 00:16:01.114
<v ->As a mirror, but the thing that's important is while,</v>

418
00:16:01.114 --> 00:16:03.002
(clears throat) and I think you'd agree with me there,

419
00:16:03.952 --> 00:16:06.480
is that there's great power, as a therapist I know this,

420
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.456
there's great power in emotional wounds.

421
00:16:09.456 --> 00:16:11.589
Great healing power in emotional wounds,

422
00:16:11.589 --> 00:16:13.349
'cause everybody wants to heal.

423
00:16:13.349 --> 00:16:14.629
<v Voiceover>And, you know, there is a phenomenon</v>

424
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:16.740
that I've noticed in going through life

425
00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.066
from the time I was young with the first broken heart,

426
00:16:19.066 --> 00:16:20.996
that whenever I had a broken heart,

427
00:16:20.996 --> 00:16:23.951
I noticed that when I would emerge out into the world,

428
00:16:23.951 --> 00:16:27.065
say, after an evening of being in tears,

429
00:16:27.065 --> 00:16:28.644
or in a fitful sleep,

430
00:16:28.644 --> 00:16:29.870
I'd go out into the world,

431
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.846
I noticed that my being was so opened.

432
00:16:32.846 --> 00:16:33.699
<v ->Yes.</v>

433
00:16:33.699 --> 00:16:35.769
<v Voiceover>So sensitive and alive,</v>

434
00:16:35.769 --> 00:16:37.443
and I thought, isn't that interesting,

435
00:16:37.443 --> 00:16:38.734
that the...

436
00:16:38.734 --> 00:16:42.040
in this kind of drama, in this kind of pain,

437
00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.104
colors are brighter, I can feel everybody's feelings,

438
00:16:46.104 --> 00:16:48.098
everything is just more alive,

439
00:16:48.098 --> 00:16:50.232
I'm more sensitive to everything.

440
00:16:50.232 --> 00:16:54.210
And is there a place in what you teach

441
00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.961
for us to be able to maintain that kind of

442
00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.797
open sensitivity without having...

443
00:17:01.797 --> 00:17:04.591
being in the midst of that kind of pain?

444
00:17:04.591 --> 00:17:08.740
<v ->Yes, I think what you're talking about is boundaries,</v>

445
00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.204
really, and that's where...

446
00:17:11.204 --> 00:17:12.740
and that's another book, the earlier book,

447
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.180
that's where the father comes in.

448
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:17.892
If we have a good sense of boundaries within us,

449
00:17:17.892 --> 00:17:20.633
personal boundaries, which we get from father,

450
00:17:20.633 --> 00:17:21.796
you know, the sense of...

451
00:17:21.796 --> 00:17:26.318
then we can know, we can protect

452
00:17:26.318 --> 00:17:27.918
the vulnerable part of us.

453
00:17:27.918 --> 00:17:30.360
Because the masculine takes the feminine

454
00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.166
out into the world because he loves her,

455
00:17:33.166 --> 00:17:34.606
so he protects her.

456
00:17:34.606 --> 00:17:37.645
And it means that we can be in that open place,

457
00:17:37.645 --> 00:17:39.732
but we can also be minding ourselves.

458
00:17:40.303 --> 00:17:42.180
<v Voiceover>It's quite a dance, a very artful dance.</v>

459
00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.855
<v ->It is, but, you know, it's beautiful.</v>

460
00:17:43.855 --> 00:17:45.337
And, in fact, you know,

461
00:17:45.337 --> 00:17:47.684
obviously we've had a discussion before, off camera,

462
00:17:47.684 --> 00:17:49.326
about the tango.

463
00:17:49.326 --> 00:17:51.182
But the tango, it offers the opportunity,

464
00:17:51.182 --> 00:17:54.851
it's a perfect dance of love and the inner marriage,

465
00:17:54.851 --> 00:17:56.067
and balance.
<v Voiceover>It definitely is</v>

466
00:17:56.067 --> 00:17:57.966
<v Benig>Yes.</v>
<v Voiceover>but we both have</v>

467
00:17:57.966 --> 00:17:59.918
a passion for Argentine tango, yes.

468
00:17:59.918 --> 00:18:03.235
<v ->But, so, that is the challenge, I think, for us.</v>

469
00:18:03.235 --> 00:18:05.123
Which is probably, you know, one of the reasons

470
00:18:05.123 --> 00:18:06.861
why I've been speaking at this conference

471
00:18:06.861 --> 00:18:07.928
about consciousness.

472
00:18:07.928 --> 00:18:10.573
Because that is what we need to be able to...

473
00:18:10.573 --> 00:18:12.365
where we need to be able to be.

474
00:18:12.365 --> 00:18:15.266
To stay in the heart, but to fe...

475
00:18:15.266 --> 00:18:16.962
to protect ourselves, also.

476
00:18:16.962 --> 00:18:19.138
And protection doesn't mean shutting down.

477
00:18:19.331 --> 00:18:20.472
<v Voiceover>Right, and that's a mistake</v>

478
00:18:20.472 --> 00:18:21.635
a lot of people make.

479
00:18:21.635 --> 00:18:23.768
<v ->I know, and that's the message in the book,</v>

480
00:18:23.768 --> 00:18:25.347
that don't shut do...

481
00:18:25.347 --> 00:18:27.181
In fact, once you've had your heart opened

482
00:18:27.181 --> 00:18:29.347
and really experienced heartbreak,

483
00:18:29.347 --> 00:18:31.501
you will find that it's hard to shut down.

484
00:18:31.501 --> 00:18:33.570
You know that, in fact, you know,

485
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.288
there is a tendency to try and do it,

486
00:18:35.288 --> 00:18:37.559
but if your heart has really been opened,

487
00:18:38.739 --> 00:18:42.019
the hope is that you will always be able to go back there

488
00:18:42.019 --> 00:18:44.291
and, if you do the work, be able to

489
00:18:44.291 --> 00:18:45.753
protect yourself at the same time.

490
00:18:45.753 --> 00:18:47.032
<v Voiceover>And speaking of the work,</v>

491
00:18:47.032 --> 00:18:48.003
we want to...

492
00:18:48.003 --> 00:18:51.118
I would like to finish this interview with

493
00:18:51.118 --> 00:18:54.179
the tasks you talk about toward the end of the book,

494
00:18:54.179 --> 00:18:56.067
which are mythological in nature,

495
00:18:56.067 --> 00:18:58.498
and you're talking about Psyche at this point,

496
00:18:58.498 --> 00:19:00.216
and her journey, but...

497
00:19:00.216 --> 00:19:02.263
Let's talk about task one: Sorting Seeds.

498
00:19:02.263 --> 00:19:03.789
I want to go through the four of them,

499
00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:06.978
just very briefly, so we can see what is...

500
00:19:06.978 --> 00:19:11.340
what our charge is in this expansion of consciousness

501
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.804
to find our place to this place where we're strong

502
00:19:13.804 --> 00:19:17.772
yet able to really exude the sensitive and the feminine

503
00:19:17.772 --> 00:19:18.956
and not lost that.

504
00:19:18.956 --> 00:19:19.862
<v ->Yes.</v>

505
00:19:19.862 --> 00:19:22.836
Well, in the book I've used the story of Amour and Psyche,

506
00:19:22.836 --> 00:19:25.289
and Psyche, of course, has to go through all these tasks

507
00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:26.867
when she loses Amour,

508
00:19:26.867 --> 00:19:29.071
in order to get back to him again.

509
00:19:29.408 --> 00:19:32.127
So, the sorting of the seeds, um...

510
00:19:32.127 --> 00:19:34.399
I won't have time to give the whole mythology

511
00:19:34.399 --> 00:19:35.423
of it,
<v Voiceover>No, just</v>

512
00:19:35.423 --> 00:19:36.724
very briefly, essence of it.
<v Benig>Yes, very briefly.</v>

513
00:19:36.724 --> 00:19:39.347
Well, it means, basically it means

514
00:19:39.347 --> 00:19:44.347
having to stand back and look at your patterns, basically.

515
00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.983
Look at all the things that are going on.

516
00:19:46.983 --> 00:19:49.127
Ok, is this me, is this him?

517
00:19:50.157 --> 00:19:54.449
What am I putting into this situation that is mine,

518
00:19:54.449 --> 00:19:55.979
that I need to look at?

519
00:19:56.561 --> 00:19:59.814
Am I behaving as an abandoned child?

520
00:19:59.814 --> 00:20:00.976
Did I push him away?

521
00:20:00.976 --> 00:20:04.368
This kind of thing, so it's about sorting,

522
00:20:04.368 --> 00:20:07.365
sorting things, sorting, going inside and doing--

523
00:20:07.365 --> 00:20:08.528
<v Voiceover>Taking stock, yeah.</v>

524
00:20:08.528 --> 00:20:11.472
<v ->Taking stock, sorting out, looking at the patterns within.</v>

525
00:20:11.472 --> 00:20:12.560
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm.</v>

526
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.584
<v ->That's what the sorting of the seeds is,</v>

527
00:20:13.584 --> 00:20:15.098
'cause they each go into their own pile,

528
00:20:15.098 --> 00:20:15.973
as you know.

529
00:20:15.973 --> 00:20:17.295
<v Voiceover>Right, and then tasks, too--</v>

530
00:20:17.295 --> 00:20:18.554
<v ->I'm sorry, before I go on to task two,</v>

531
00:20:18.554 --> 00:20:22.735
and she is helped, of course, by ants, loads of ants,

532
00:20:22.735 --> 00:20:25.214
and they represent our intuition.

533
00:20:25.615 --> 00:20:27.791
Our inner voice that we often don't listen to.

534
00:20:27.791 --> 00:20:28.697
<v Voiceover>And the ants come</v>

535
00:20:28.697 --> 00:20:29.764
and they help her sort through,

536
00:20:29.764 --> 00:20:30.671
carry the seeds.
<v Benig>They help her</v>

537
00:20:30.671 --> 00:20:32.025
sort through,
<v Voiceover>go pile to pile.</v>

538
00:20:32.025 --> 00:20:33.038
<v Benig>Cause she couldn't do it on her own, yes.</v>

539
00:20:33.038 --> 00:20:34.180
<v Voiceover>Yes, so she is receiving</v>

540
00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.364
the intuitive assistance.

541
00:20:35.364 --> 00:20:36.036
<v ->Yes.</v>

542
00:20:36.036 --> 00:20:38.457
<v Voiceover>Task two, Acquiring Some Golden Fleece.</v>

543
00:20:38.457 --> 00:20:40.377
<v ->Now, that's an interesting one,</v>

544
00:20:40.377 --> 00:20:42.819
because it, basically, the...

545
00:20:42.819 --> 00:20:45.112
To get the Golden Fleece she has to

546
00:20:45.112 --> 00:20:48.600
get them from these very fierce solar rams,

547
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.064
which would damage her and trample over her.

548
00:20:51.064 --> 00:20:54.008
So it's symbolic, and, as you know, she does it,

549
00:20:54.008 --> 00:20:55.586
but, again, she's helped.

550
00:20:56.706 --> 00:20:59.028
She does it at night, when the rams are asleep,

551
00:20:59.028 --> 00:21:04.028
so she gets the wool from the briars they brushed against.

552
00:21:04.062 --> 00:21:07.646
And this symbolizes the taking of one's power,

553
00:21:07.646 --> 00:21:09.246
but indirectly.

554
00:21:09.246 --> 00:21:11.635
Not doing it, woof, straight out.

555
00:21:11.635 --> 00:21:13.630
It's about negotiating power,

556
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:15.144
negotiating your own personal power

557
00:21:15.144 --> 00:21:16.819
and I don't mean power over.

558
00:21:16.819 --> 00:21:18.600
I mean your own assertion.

559
00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.523
Without knowing when to do it,

560
00:21:21.523 --> 00:21:23.613
and not putting yourself in the firing line,

561
00:21:23.613 --> 00:21:25.874
where you won't, you know, you'll be trampled,

562
00:21:25.874 --> 00:21:29.396
but doing it indirectly, in a way that will service you.

563
00:21:29.396 --> 00:21:30.463
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

564
00:21:30.463 --> 00:21:31.189
<v ->And--</v>

565
00:21:31.189 --> 00:21:32.746
<v Voiceover>Somewhere a feminine essence of power.</v>

566
00:21:32.746 --> 00:21:34.602
<v ->Very much feminine and, in fact,</v>

567
00:21:34.602 --> 00:21:37.204
because it's a myth about a woman,

568
00:21:37.204 --> 00:21:42.025
it's very much connected with feminine psychology.

569
00:21:42.025 --> 00:21:46.534
But it's something which, for women, is a tricky issue.

570
00:21:46.752 --> 00:21:47.872
<v Voiceover>Yes,</v>
<v Benig>Power.</v>

571
00:21:47.872 --> 00:21:48.917
<v Voiceover>Yes, it is.</v>

572
00:21:48.917 --> 00:21:49.887
<v ->It's seen in the world.</v>

573
00:21:49.887 --> 00:21:51.626
<v Voiceover>It's something we usually give away.</v>

574
00:21:51.626 --> 00:21:55.156
<v ->Yeah, because of a lot of the ways that we might be seen,</v>

575
00:21:55.156 --> 00:21:56.778
you know, as an animus woman,

576
00:21:56.778 --> 00:21:58.921
or, you know, a masculine-type woman,

577
00:21:58.921 --> 00:22:00.084
and we...

578
00:22:00.084 --> 00:22:02.793
It's not an easy thing, to find the balance.

579
00:22:02.793 --> 00:22:03.679
<v Voiceover>No, it isn't.</v>

580
00:22:03.679 --> 00:22:06.814
Ok, task three, Filling the Golden Flask.

581
00:22:06.814 --> 00:22:09.182
<v ->Yeah, now, the Golden Flask, again,</v>

582
00:22:09.182 --> 00:22:11.966
now the eagle comes to her aid.

583
00:22:13.276 --> 00:22:15.947
That is about gaining perspective.

584
00:22:15.947 --> 00:22:18.795
And again, it's to do with incorporating

585
00:22:18.795 --> 00:22:20.235
what comes from father.

586
00:22:20.235 --> 00:22:22.634
It's the ability to look at the bigger picture.

587
00:22:22.956 --> 00:22:25.772
Because she has to collect water from the very top,

588
00:22:25.772 --> 00:22:26.785
right down that goes in,

589
00:22:26.785 --> 00:22:28.481
the river that goes down, right through.

590
00:22:28.481 --> 00:22:30.081
It's the circle of life.

591
00:22:30.081 --> 00:22:32.993
So it's the ability and the eagle represents

592
00:22:33.983 --> 00:22:38.508
the aspect that enables us to see things

593
00:22:38.508 --> 00:22:40.652
form a higher perspective.

594
00:22:40.652 --> 00:22:42.529
So it's contact with our higher self.

595
00:22:42.529 --> 00:22:43.393
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm.</v>

596
00:22:43.393 --> 00:22:44.716
<v ->Really, with your higher self.</v>

597
00:22:44.716 --> 00:22:45.686
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

598
00:22:45.686 --> 00:22:48.726
<v ->And the ability to get, gain a perspective,</v>

599
00:22:48.726 --> 00:22:50.774
so you're not lost in the emotions.

600
00:22:50.774 --> 00:22:52.118
And of course we're lost in the emotions,

601
00:22:52.118 --> 00:22:53.814
we'er basket cases some of the time.

602
00:22:53.814 --> 00:22:57.664
For a while, until we learn to take the distance.

603
00:22:57.664 --> 00:22:58.550
<v Voiceover>Yes,</v>

604
00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.971
Now, how about task four: Learning to Say No.

605
00:23:00.971 --> 00:23:02.517
This is a really big one and you...

606
00:23:02.517 --> 00:23:03.776
we have a little time and you can

607
00:23:03.776 --> 00:23:06.400
spend a little time on this, Learning to Say No.

608
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.600
<v ->Yeah, and it's, it's, it is a big one.</v>

609
00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.686
Learning to say no, but, you see,

610
00:23:11.686 --> 00:23:14.790
she has to go into the Underworld in the fourth task,

611
00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.947
and on the way into the Underworld,

612
00:23:17.947 --> 00:23:21.687
which, basically, is symbolic of letting go of the ego,

613
00:23:22.002 --> 00:23:25.511
you know, of just letting go and being there.

614
00:23:25.511 --> 00:23:27.623
And on the way into the Underworld,

615
00:23:27.623 --> 00:23:30.283
she's going to be asked for help from people,

616
00:23:30.918 --> 00:23:33.265
helpless people, and she needs...

617
00:23:33.265 --> 00:23:37.051
she's been told she has to refuse to help them,

618
00:23:37.051 --> 00:23:38.491
and to say, "No."

619
00:23:38.491 --> 00:23:41.232
And the power of saying no four times

620
00:23:41.232 --> 00:23:44.155
means she exercises the power of choice.

621
00:23:44.155 --> 00:23:47.216
So, again, as you say, it sometimes can be

622
00:23:47.216 --> 00:23:50.469
hard to-to say no, as-as women,

623
00:23:50.469 --> 00:23:52.538
a lot of us, and I have children, and, you know,

624
00:23:52.538 --> 00:23:54.629
a lot of us are conditioned to...

625
00:23:54.629 --> 00:23:58.458
and we feel it, you know, to listen to the needs of others,

626
00:23:58.458 --> 00:24:01.103
to attend to others needs rather than our own.

627
00:24:01.103 --> 00:24:03.940
And this is the task of being discerning,

628
00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.980
and being able to say no to others

629
00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:10.571
when it means we might be compromising ourselves.

630
00:24:10.571 --> 00:24:12.986
And in love relationships, that's a huge thing.

631
00:24:13.365 --> 00:24:15.658
'Cause so many of us travel down the wrong roads

632
00:24:15.658 --> 00:24:16.885
looking for love,

633
00:24:16.885 --> 00:24:20.505
and we might compromise ourselves in an attempt to get it.

634
00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:22.186
Are we stay with the person

635
00:24:22.186 --> 00:24:23.899
because we just want to be loved?

636
00:24:24.246 --> 00:24:28.048
So if we say no, it means we're looking after ourselves.

637
00:24:28.587 --> 00:24:30.166
<v Voiceover>So in this journey,</v>

638
00:24:30.166 --> 00:24:33.472
we interviewed someone else a couple of days ago

639
00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:36.021
on the Secrets of Letting Go.

640
00:24:36.021 --> 00:24:39.669
In this journey, and the journey you've personally taken,

641
00:24:40.689 --> 00:24:43.654
what is it that you feel we essentially need

642
00:24:43.654 --> 00:24:46.353
to be prepared to let go of in order to be able to

643
00:24:46.353 --> 00:24:49.877
give birth to this more mature version of ourselves?

644
00:24:50.619 --> 00:24:51.782
<v ->That's quite complex.</v>

645
00:24:51.782 --> 00:24:56.240
But we have to basically let go of our sense of immortality,

646
00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.960
and I don't mean that literally, I mean the ego.

647
00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.114
The journey that we think we want,

648
00:25:01.114 --> 00:25:03.766
we have to be able to let go of what we think we want

649
00:25:04.423 --> 00:25:08.060
to allow what needs to emerge to come through.

650
00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.393
Do you know what I mean?

651
00:25:09.393 --> 00:25:10.204
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

652
00:25:10.204 --> 00:25:11.014
<v ->Yes.</v>

653
00:25:11.014 --> 00:25:14.385
We also have to be able to say no to

654
00:25:14.385 --> 00:25:16.102
some of our instinctual...

655
00:25:16.102 --> 00:25:19.654
to some of our drives, you know.

656
00:25:19.654 --> 00:25:22.438
Because if we learn to do that,

657
00:25:22.438 --> 00:25:25.851
then we are in communion with ourselves.

658
00:25:25.851 --> 00:25:27.643
With our souls, with the part of us,

659
00:25:27.643 --> 00:25:29.189
the deeper part of ourselves.

660
00:25:29.189 --> 00:25:31.280
You know, to say no to the impulse

661
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:35.440
to get involved with somebody when we know it's not right,

662
00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.279
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

663
00:25:36.279 --> 00:25:38.989
<v ->you know, and that we will end up getting hurt.</v>

664
00:25:38.989 --> 00:25:40.642
As I say, it's not--

665
00:25:40.642 --> 00:25:42.220
<v Voiceover>And when we know we're not ready.</v>

666
00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.223
I mean,
<v Benig>Yes.</v>

667
00:25:43.223 --> 00:25:44.215
<v Voiceover>it could be a timing thing,</v>

668
00:25:44.215 --> 00:25:46.007
it can be a personality thing, whatever, you know.

669
00:25:46.007 --> 00:25:48.771
<v ->Or that it will, in some way, you know, damage us.</v>

670
00:25:48.771 --> 00:25:50.606
And it's not about closing down

671
00:25:50.606 --> 00:25:52.107
and not going out there again,

672
00:25:52.585 --> 00:25:54.148
but it's about knowing yourself.

673
00:25:54.148 --> 00:25:55.257
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

674
00:25:55.257 --> 00:26:00.257
<v ->So letting go of a lot of preconceptions,</v>

675
00:26:00.302 --> 00:26:03.267
a lot of ideas that we might have

676
00:26:03.267 --> 00:26:04.334
about what we really want,

677
00:26:04.334 --> 00:26:06.009
I need this, I need that.

678
00:26:06.009 --> 00:26:08.707
Forget it, in a way, and rest for a bit,

679
00:26:08.707 --> 00:26:10.307
and come to your center.

680
00:26:10.307 --> 00:26:12.237
Because when you come to your center,

681
00:26:12.237 --> 00:26:13.955
you encounter the still point,

682
00:26:13.955 --> 00:26:15.337
and in the still point...

683
00:26:15.695 --> 00:26:18.223
There's a beautiful saying, beautiful,

684
00:26:18.223 --> 00:26:21.284
and I have it on my website, it's,

685
00:26:21.984 --> 00:26:25.846
"It is said that what you are seeking is also seeing you.

686
00:26:26.246 --> 00:26:29.045
"So if you sit still, it will come to you."

687
00:26:29.211 --> 00:26:30.587
<v Voiceover>Ah, that's very beautiful.</v>

688
00:26:30.587 --> 00:26:31.441
<v ->Yes.</v>

689
00:26:31.441 --> 00:26:33.883
<v Voiceover>And what's wonderful about this book is</v>

690
00:26:33.883 --> 00:26:36.806
it's not a dry read, it's not a psychological

691
00:26:36.806 --> 00:26:37.712
perspective
<v Benig>No.</v>

692
00:26:37.712 --> 00:26:38.917
<v Voiceover>or profile of all of this.</v>

693
00:26:38.917 --> 00:26:40.752
You actually set out to write a novel

694
00:26:40.752 --> 00:26:43.397
and you went to the Sierra Madre, as I understand,

695
00:26:43.397 --> 00:26:45.520
in Spain, you went to the mountains for a little while?

696
00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.789
<v ->I went to the Sierra Nevada</v>

697
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:47.792
for a little while.
<v Voiceover>Sierra Nevada,</v>

698
00:26:47.792 --> 00:26:48.645
yes.
<v Benig>and then</v>

699
00:26:48.645 --> 00:26:49.967
I finished it in Ireland, where I come from.

700
00:26:49.967 --> 00:26:51.503
Which is also in the middle of the country.

701
00:26:51.503 --> 00:26:52.879
<v Voiceover>So you really went on this journey of</v>

702
00:26:52.879 --> 00:26:56.004
having to look at the discipline required to write this book

703
00:26:56.004 --> 00:26:58.052
and, at the same time, finding that

704
00:26:58.052 --> 00:26:59.396
you weren't ready on certain days.

705
00:26:59.396 --> 00:27:00.996
You couldn't do the task, and you had to

706
00:27:00.996 --> 00:27:01.999
let go.
<v Benig>You read that bit?</v>

707
00:27:01.999 --> 00:27:02.905
<v Voiceover>Oh, yeah.</v>

708
00:27:02.905 --> 00:27:04.783
And that you had to, yourself, learn to

709
00:27:04.783 --> 00:27:07.204
honor what was really going on in you,

710
00:27:07.204 --> 00:27:09.710
even though you had your own self-imposed deadline.

711
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:12.003
And so this really was for you a journey of

712
00:27:12.003 --> 00:27:15.161
learning to honor yourself completely as well,

713
00:27:15.161 --> 00:27:18.179
and you share beautiful stories in a novel style

714
00:27:18.179 --> 00:27:20.291
about other people's experience

715
00:27:20.291 --> 00:27:22.040
that help us see ourselves in this.

716
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.525
So my compliments to you.

717
00:27:24.525 --> 00:27:25.528
You've done a
<v Benig>Thank you.</v>

718
00:27:25.528 --> 00:27:28.237
<v Voiceover>beautiful job of writing a very readable book</v>

719
00:27:28.237 --> 00:27:30.445
that allows anyone access to the knowledge,

720
00:27:30.445 --> 00:27:33.325
and to be able to do the work along with it.

721
00:27:33.325 --> 00:27:34.487
<v ->Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.</v>

722
00:27:34.487 --> 00:27:35.437
<v Voiceover>It's very nicely done.</v>

723
00:27:35.437 --> 00:27:37.383
Any final thoughts before we go?

724
00:27:38.018 --> 00:27:39.479
<v ->No, I think that, if anything,</v>

725
00:27:39.479 --> 00:27:41.132
and I said in the beginning of the book,

726
00:27:41.132 --> 00:27:43.682
in the introduction, that it is a message of hope.

727
00:27:43.682 --> 00:27:47.628
In terms of a huge thing that's happening

728
00:27:47.628 --> 00:27:48.972
in the modern world.

729
00:27:48.972 --> 00:27:51.713
People have had broken hearts since the beginning of time.

730
00:27:51.713 --> 00:27:54.412
Since love, you know, love has always existed.

731
00:27:54.412 --> 00:27:56.875
But there is, at the moment, I think,

732
00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:58.499
a great fear of relationship.

733
00:27:58.499 --> 00:27:59.405
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

734
00:27:59.405 --> 00:28:00.612
And of the heart.

735
00:28:00.612 --> 00:28:03.214
And so it is really a message of hope

736
00:28:03.214 --> 00:28:06.787
and it's (stammers) it's wonderful.

737
00:28:06.787 --> 00:28:07.790
<v Voiceover>Yes, it is,</v>

738
00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:08.995
it genuinely is,
<v Benig>Yes.</v>

739
00:28:08.995 --> 00:28:10.296
<v Voiceover>and you can</v>
<v Benig>Thank you.</v>

740
00:28:10.296 --> 00:28:11.662
<v Voiceover>find yourself at the bottom of all of it.</v>

741
00:28:11.662 --> 00:28:12.845
That's the gift.

742
00:28:12.845 --> 00:28:13.688
Thank you.

743
00:28:13.688 --> 00:28:15.122
<v ->Thank you, also.</v>

744
00:28:16.888 --> 00:28:18.285
<v ->I hope you enjoyed the interview.</v>

745
00:28:18.285 --> 00:28:20.162
