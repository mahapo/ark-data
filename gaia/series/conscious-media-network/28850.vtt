<v ->According to Dr. David Spiegel denial is not</v>

00:00:03.815 --> 00:00:06.055 line:15% 
an effective strategy for dealing with health issues.

3
00:00:06.055 --> 00:00:07.518 line:15% 
He's the medical director

4
00:00:07.518 --> 00:00:09.139 line:15% 
of the Center for Integrated Medicine

5
00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:11.399 line:15% 
at Stanford University School of Medicine.

6
00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:14.120 line:15% 
His education on the mind/body connection

7
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.658 line:15% 
and cancer came crashing down in front of him

8
00:00:16.658 --> 00:00:18.406 line:15% 
while interfacing with a patient.

9
00:00:18.406 --> 00:00:20.455 line:15% 
This is when he learned that the patients

10
00:00:20.455 --> 00:00:21.894 line:15% 
have much to teach the doctor.

11
00:00:21.894 --> 00:00:25.052 line:15% 
Dr. Spiegel has turned out to be a wonderful student

12
00:00:25.052 --> 00:00:27.014 line:15% 
and has furthered the research into the

13
00:00:27.014 --> 00:00:29.904 line:15% 
stress indicators that foretell the development of cancer.

14
00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:32.304 line:15% 
(soft music)

15
00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:40.760 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>I was watching your presentation</v>

16
00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:43.543 line:15% 
a little while ago and one of the big questions that came up

17
00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:45.406 line:15% 
is can happiness emerge from sadness

18
00:00:45.406 --> 00:00:48.103 line:15% 
and the point of your discussion is suppression of sadness

19
00:00:48.103 --> 00:00:50.833 line:15% 
will actually prevent happiness, thus that question

20
00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:52.050 line:15% 
and you've worked with

21
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.460 line:15% 
some people who were very sad.

22
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.063 line:15% 
People who had learned that they've had a diagnosis

23
00:00:57.063 --> 00:00:59.303 line:15% 
that was probably going to prove to be fatal

24
00:00:59.303 --> 00:01:00.700 line:15% 
sooner than later

25
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.700 line:15% 
and with your incredible background in academia

26
00:01:06.673 --> 00:01:07.655 line:15% 
and also in medicine,

27
00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:09.723 line:15% 
you were able to do some studies

28
00:01:09.723 --> 00:01:11.344 line:15% 
that have proved to be really profound.

29
00:01:11.344 --> 00:01:14.032 line:15% 
So let's just launch in and tell us why you first

30
00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:15.739 line:15% 
started doing these studies

31
00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:18.395 line:15% 
looking at mind/body and what you found emerging.

32
00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:21.914 line:15% 
<v ->Well it actually began when I was in college.</v>

33
00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:23.664 line:15% 
I was a philosophy major in college

34
00:01:23.664 --> 00:01:26.874 line:15% 
and I started out thinking I'd be a psychology major

35
00:01:26.874 --> 00:01:28.580 line:15% 
and I took this great psych course

36
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.866 line:15% 
and the professor who was a reconstructed

37
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.306 line:15% 
Shakspearean actor and a great lecturer

38
00:01:33.306 --> 00:01:36.943 line:15% 
would compellingly present each psychological

39
00:01:36.943 --> 00:01:39.097 line:15% 
theory and that week I was really into that one.

40
00:01:39.097 --> 00:01:41.679 line:15% 
You know it was Freud or Adler or Jung or somebody else

41
00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:44.014 line:15% 
and the next week I got completely into the next one.

42
00:01:44.014 --> 00:01:46.756 line:15% 
Suddenly I realized there was no ground for internally

43
00:01:46.756 --> 00:01:48.281 line:15% 
they were all consistent but there was no ground for

44
00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:49.710 line:15% 
choosing one over the other.

45
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.472 line:15% 
So I became a philosophy major and I loved reading

46
00:01:52.472 --> 00:01:55.033 line:15% 
continental philosophy particular existential

47
00:01:55.033 --> 00:01:59.032 line:15% 
and one of the premises of existential philosophy

48
00:01:59.032 --> 00:02:01.101 line:15% 
is that you don't really live authentically until you face

49
00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:03.032 line:15% 
the contingency of life.

50
00:02:03.032 --> 00:02:05.080 line:15% 
You're own risk of non-being

51
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.277 line:15% 
and then you start to comprehend what being

52
00:02:07.277 --> 00:02:09.250 line:15% 
and freedom and choice is really all about.

53
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.410 line:15% 
So, years later I then went to medical school.

54
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.732 line:15% 
I met a physician.

55
00:02:14.732 --> 00:02:16.364 line:15% 
I decided I wanted to be a real physician

56
00:02:16.364 --> 00:02:18.104 line:15% 
and actually know a few facts

57
00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:19.224 line:15% 
rather than just how to think

58
00:02:19.224 --> 00:02:22.657 line:15% 
and I was recruited to Stanford by Irv Yalom,

59
00:02:22.657 --> 00:02:24.705 line:15% 
who has been a wonderful mentor

60
00:02:24.705 --> 00:02:25.953 line:15% 
and friend for many years.

61
00:02:25.953 --> 00:02:27.510 line:15% 
Who has a wonderful new book called

62
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.163 line:15% 
"Staring at the Sun" about facing death.

63
00:02:29.163 --> 00:02:31.073 line:15% 
And he said, look,

64
00:02:31.073 --> 00:02:34.283 line:15% 
you know he's the world's authority on group therapy

65
00:02:34.283 --> 00:02:36.471 line:15% 
and he said I want to start a group of people

66
00:02:36.471 --> 00:02:37.707 line:15% 
who are facing their own death

67
00:02:37.707 --> 00:02:41.249 line:15% 
because I think if the existential philosophers

68
00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:42.613 line:15% 
and the ancient Greeks are right,

69
00:02:42.613 --> 00:02:46.613 line:15% 
you can actually create a period of growth

70
00:02:46.613 --> 00:02:49.173 line:15% 
rather than decline as you're facing your own mortality

71
00:02:49.173 --> 00:02:50.773 line:15% 
and that's what I want to see if we can do.

72
00:02:50.773 --> 00:02:52.213 line:15% 
So he called me up

73
00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:53.962 line:15% 
when I was a starting assistant professor

74
00:02:53.962 --> 00:02:55.999 line:15% 
and said would you like to co-lead a group

75
00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:57.300 line:15% 
of dying patients with me

76
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.634 line:15% 
and when the world's authority on group therapy

77
00:02:58.634 --> 00:02:59.915 line:15% 
invites you to co-lead a group,

78
00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:01.546 line:15% 
you know you think a second and a half

79
00:03:01.546 --> 00:03:02.537 line:15% 
and you say yes.

80
00:03:02.537 --> 00:03:03.860 line:15% 
So I did."

81
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.831 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

82
00:03:04.831 --> 00:03:06.601 line:15% 
<v ->And that was the first cancer support group that I ran</v>

83
00:03:06.601 --> 00:03:07.797 line:15% 
and co-led with Irv.

84
00:03:07.797 --> 00:03:08.777 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Now how long ago was this?</v>

85
00:03:08.777 --> 00:03:10.133 line:15% 
<v ->This was like 1976.</v>

86
00:03:10.133 --> 00:03:11.028 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

87
00:03:11.028 --> 00:03:11.988 line:15% 
<v ->A long time ago.</v>

88
00:03:11.988 --> 00:03:13.757 line:15% 
And at the time we were warned

89
00:03:13.757 --> 00:03:15.443 line:15% 
that we were going to be doing terrible harm

90
00:03:15.443 --> 00:03:17.203 line:15% 
to these women.

91
00:03:17.203 --> 00:03:18.057 line:15% 
That they would watch one another die.

92
00:03:18.057 --> 00:03:19.603 line:15% 
You know the median survival was two years

93
00:03:19.603 --> 00:03:20.883 line:15% 
with metastatic breast cancer.

94
00:03:20.883 --> 00:03:22.079 line:15% 
And we'd demoralize them

95
00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.521 line:15% 
and at first I was very nervous about that.

96
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:25.779 line:15% 
I'm just starting out my career.

97
00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:27.443 line:15% 
I'm going to wind up demoralizing

98
00:03:27.443 --> 00:03:28.499 line:15% 
a bunch of cancer patients.

99
00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:31.368 line:15% 
And you know we were psychiatrists,

100
00:03:31.368 --> 00:03:32.957 line:15% 
they weren't even my patients.

101
00:03:32.957 --> 00:03:34.397 line:15% 
You know they were cancer patients.

102
00:03:34.397 --> 00:03:36.647 line:15% 
But then it began to dawn on me

103
00:03:36.647 --> 00:03:37.746 line:15% 
as i listened to them

104
00:03:37.746 --> 00:03:39.837 line:15% 
that death was not a novel concept

105
00:03:39.837 --> 00:03:42.194 line:15% 
that it didn't take somebody else dying to figure out

106
00:03:42.194 --> 00:03:43.378 line:15% 
that they might die from cancer.

107
00:03:43.378 --> 00:03:46.417 line:15% 
And that they were really growing from their ability

108
00:03:46.417 --> 00:03:47.985 line:15% 
to face the death.

109
00:03:47.985 --> 00:03:49.180 line:15% 
That they could look at it.

110
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.609 line:15% 
That they could be of help to one another.

111
00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.988 line:15% 
That they could understand what it felt like

112
00:03:52.988 --> 00:03:56.027 line:15% 
from the other side in a sense.

113
00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:57.819 line:15% 
One woman in one of the groups

114
00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.212 line:15% 
was saying to a new member,

115
00:04:01.212 --> 00:04:04.059 line:15% 
a delightful, warm, vivacious woman who was very sick,

116
00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:05.051 line:15% 
who joined the group.

117
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:06.064 line:15% 
She said you know I just realized something,

118
00:04:06.064 --> 00:04:07.612 line:15% 
I'm keeping my distance from you.

119
00:04:07.612 --> 00:04:09.051 line:15% 
I don't want to get too close

120
00:04:09.051 --> 00:04:10.715 line:15% 
because I'm protecting myself.

121
00:04:10.715 --> 00:04:11.536 line:15% 
I know you're going to die soon

122
00:04:11.536 --> 00:04:13.040 line:15% 
and I'll stop that.

123
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.779 line:15% 
I'm changing it but I now understand

124
00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:16.773 line:15% 
how my friends and family are dealing with me.

125
00:04:16.773 --> 00:04:18.640 line:15% 
That they're keeping their distance from me.

126
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.207 line:15% 
So you get to see it from both sides,

127
00:04:20.207 --> 00:04:21.914 line:15% 
not just the one who by identification

128
00:04:21.914 --> 00:04:23.684 line:15% 
is also going to die of the same illness

129
00:04:23.684 --> 00:04:26.427 line:15% 
but from the point of view of other human beings

130
00:04:26.427 --> 00:04:28.048 line:15% 
who are interacting with you.

131
00:04:28.048 --> 00:04:29.860 line:15% 
So I found it a very powerful thing

132
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.217 line:15% 
and that people really grew and learned

133
00:04:32.217 --> 00:04:33.945 line:15% 
and made life decisions

134
00:04:33.945 --> 00:04:36.686 line:15% 
and just were open and direct with one another

135
00:04:36.686 --> 00:04:40.099 line:15% 
and you know we had some of these groups

136
00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:42.147 line:15% 
that ran for ten years, once a week

137
00:04:42.147 --> 00:04:44.868 line:15% 
and I had women say this

138
00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:46.318 line:15% 
is the least superficial thing I do in my life.

139
00:04:46.318 --> 00:04:49.197 line:15% 
And so it struck me that there's something there

140
00:04:49.197 --> 00:04:51.043 line:15% 
that was worth pursuing

141
00:04:51.043 --> 00:04:52.472 line:15% 
but it was really not about,

142
00:04:52.472 --> 00:04:54.904 line:15% 
it certainly wasn't about extending life.

143
00:04:54.904 --> 00:04:57.389 line:15% 
It was hopefully about making quality of life better.

144
00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.842 line:15% 
But also about the idea that it could

145
00:04:59.842 --> 00:05:00.674 line:15% 
be a period of growth.

146
00:05:00.674 --> 00:05:01.697 line:15% 
That you could learn things

147
00:05:01.697 --> 00:05:03.864 line:15% 
that made a real difference in your life

148
00:05:03.864 --> 00:05:06.775 line:15% 
when you and others confronted your death.

149
00:05:06.775 --> 00:05:09.783 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>So as a meta-physician, as you say,</v>

150
00:05:09.783 --> 00:05:12.343 line:15% 
I love that. I've never heard that term before.

151
00:05:12.343 --> 00:05:13.431 line:15% 
That's great.

152
00:05:13.431 --> 00:05:16.546 line:15% 
As a meta-physician, would you say these woman

153
00:05:16.546 --> 00:05:18.742 line:15% 
really became your teachers through the years

154
00:05:18.742 --> 00:05:21.174 line:15% 
and your observations of them really became

155
00:05:21.174 --> 00:05:23.435 line:15% 
the basis for how you structured your studies

156
00:05:23.435 --> 00:05:25.078 line:15% 
of the future and so forth?

157
00:05:25.078 --> 00:05:26.177 line:15% 
<v ->Yes.</v>

158
00:05:26.177 --> 00:05:28.246 line:15% 
You know, I learned a tremendous amount from them.

159
00:05:28.246 --> 00:05:29.568 line:15% 
And in many literal ways, they did.

160
00:05:29.568 --> 00:05:31.254 line:15% 
I mean I was at one group

161
00:05:31.254 --> 00:05:35.318 line:15% 
that met the afternoon of the wake of my best friend

162
00:05:35.318 --> 00:05:36.821 line:15% 
who died of a glioblastoma

163
00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:38.730 line:15% 
and I was no good to them at that point.

164
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.480 line:15% 
They were very helpful to me at that meeting

165
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.325 line:15% 
and sort of comforted me with my own grief.

166
00:05:42.325 --> 00:05:44.394 line:15% 
And they taught me a great deal

167
00:05:44.394 --> 00:05:46.975 line:15% 
about valuing what matters in life.

168
00:05:46.975 --> 00:05:48.586 line:15% 
You know, about not taking the sort of,

169
00:05:48.586 --> 00:05:51.509 line:15% 
you know political infighting in academia too seriously.

170
00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:53.236 line:15% 
And recognizing what really matters.

171
00:05:53.236 --> 00:05:56.041 line:15% 
You know valuing time with your family and friends.

172
00:05:56.041 --> 00:05:58.846 line:15% 
But at the same time, you know,

173
00:05:58.846 --> 00:06:02.174 line:15% 
they would challenge me sometimes.

174
00:06:02.174 --> 00:06:03.497 line:15% 
They'd say what are you doing?

175
00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:04.147 line:15% 
You don't have cancer.

176
00:06:04.147 --> 00:06:04.755 line:15% 
You're a man.

177
00:06:04.755 --> 00:06:06.015 line:15% 
What do you understand about all this?

178
00:06:06.015 --> 00:06:08.350 line:15% 
And my ticket of admission was

179
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.533 line:15% 
knowing something about groups

180
00:06:09.533 --> 00:06:10.344 line:15% 
and group psychotherapy

181
00:06:10.344 --> 00:06:12.499 line:15% 
and how to use the group experience in the most

182
00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:15.912 line:15% 
productive way so that when a woman says, you know,

183
00:06:15.912 --> 00:06:16.766 line:15% 
my husband's clueless.

184
00:06:16.766 --> 00:06:17.597 line:15% 
He doesn't help me, you know

185
00:06:17.597 --> 00:06:20.478 line:15% 
and why he is he just not more useful.

186
00:06:20.478 --> 00:06:21.736 line:15% 
And I would say, well you know

187
00:06:21.736 --> 00:06:22.738 line:15% 
if I were you're husband right now

188
00:06:22.738 --> 00:06:24.744 line:15% 
I wouldn't know what you wanted either.

189
00:06:24.744 --> 00:06:25.576 line:15% 
What do you want?

190
00:06:25.576 --> 00:06:27.452 line:15% 
Because people often express their desires

191
00:06:27.452 --> 00:06:28.583 line:15% 
in very ambivalent ways.

192
00:06:28.583 --> 00:06:29.907 line:15% 
They don't want to have to need anything.

193
00:06:29.907 --> 00:06:32.445 line:15% 
So then they get angry when they don't get it.

194
00:06:32.445 --> 00:06:36.039 line:15% 
So my job is to be an expert in doing group therapy

195
00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:37.201 line:15% 
and helping people understand

196
00:06:37.201 --> 00:06:40.327 line:15% 
how to use their own process to learn.

197
00:06:40.327 --> 00:06:42.076 line:15% 
So it wasn't, it was two ways.

198
00:06:42.076 --> 00:06:43.942 line:15% 
You know, they were teaching me a lot

199
00:06:43.942 --> 00:06:45.852 line:15% 
about life with cancer and I was teaching them a lot

200
00:06:45.852 --> 00:06:48.678 line:15% 
about how to negotiate with one another

201
00:06:48.678 --> 00:06:50.705 line:15% 
and with other people in the world as well.

202
00:06:50.705 --> 00:06:52.294 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>To really communicate your needs</v>

203
00:06:52.294 --> 00:06:53.659 line:15% 
and desires both.

204
00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:54.736 line:15% 
<v ->That's exactly right.</v>

205
00:06:54.736 --> 00:06:56.923 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>At a time when you really need people</v>

206
00:06:56.923 --> 00:06:58.799 line:15% 
to listen, what about denial?

207
00:06:58.799 --> 00:07:02.268 line:15% 
Because that's a tract that many people take

208
00:07:02.268 --> 00:07:04.709 line:15% 
thinking well, if I don't give it power or attention

209
00:07:04.709 --> 00:07:06.458 line:15% 
it's not going to get the better of me.

210
00:07:06.458 --> 00:07:08.975 line:15% 
But isn't there something always behind you?

211
00:07:08.975 --> 00:07:11.066 line:15% 
You're kind of looking over your shoulder that way?"

212
00:07:11.066 --> 00:07:11.781 line:15% 
<v ->You are. I</v>

213
00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:12.911 line:15% 
I think denial is a big mistake.

214
00:07:12.911 --> 00:07:15.108 line:15% 
And as I said earlier, if we haven't learned

215
00:07:15.108 --> 00:07:16.954 line:15% 
in the last eight years that denial is a bad thing.

216
00:07:16.954 --> 00:07:18.298 line:15% 
(laughter)

217
00:07:18.298 --> 00:07:20.025 line:15% 
<v ->We'll never learn it.</v>

218
00:07:20.025 --> 00:07:22.448 line:15% 
You know as one example of that,

219
00:07:22.448 --> 00:07:24.378 line:15% 
You know there is this whole sort of

220
00:07:24.378 --> 00:07:26.692 line:15% 
pop psychology idea that, you know,

221
00:07:26.692 --> 00:07:28.377 line:15% 
you get cancer because you have some

222
00:07:28.377 --> 00:07:29.977 line:15% 
unmet emotional need for it.

223
00:07:29.977 --> 00:07:31.929 line:15% 
You know, it's the bane of my existence t

224
00:07:31.929 --> 00:07:33.518 line:15% 
that my last name is one letter different

225
00:07:33.518 --> 00:07:35.043 line:15% 
from a very well known Yale surgeon

226
00:07:35.043 --> 00:07:36.974 line:15% 
who writes that you get cancer because

227
00:07:36.974 --> 00:07:38.552 line:15% 
of some unmet psychological need.

228
00:07:38.552 --> 00:07:39.672 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Talking about Bernie by any chance?</v>

229
00:07:39.672 --> 00:07:40.525 line:15% 
<v ->I'm talking about Bernie.</v>

230
00:07:40.525 --> 00:07:41.379 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Bernie Seigel.</v>

231
00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:42.573 line:15% 
<v ->And that's just not true.</v>

232
00:07:42.573 --> 00:07:44.023 line:15% 
There is no evidence for it.

233
00:07:44.023 --> 00:07:45.506 line:15% 
And all it does is make people feel guilty.

234
00:07:45.506 --> 00:07:46.701 line:15% 
It's bad enough to have cancer.

235
00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:49.261 line:15% 
Now you're supposed to blame yourself for having cancer.

236
00:07:49.261 --> 00:07:51.703 line:15% 
One of my patients actually was at a retreat

237
00:07:51.703 --> 00:07:53.421 line:15% 
one of these sort of New Age retreats

238
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:55.597 line:15% 
that we have a lot of around here in California

239
00:07:55.597 --> 00:07:58.380 line:15% 
and she got a message from her doctor

240
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.195 line:15% 
that she'd had a bad new bone scan

241
00:08:00.195 --> 00:08:01.900 line:15% 
and had a whole bunch of matastasis

242
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:02.753 line:15% 
and was very upset

243
00:08:02.753 --> 00:08:04.865 line:15% 
and so she's getting in her car to drive back home

244
00:08:04.865 --> 00:08:05.741 line:15% 
and deal with it.

245
00:08:05.741 --> 00:08:07.948 line:15% 
And some guy from the retreat

246
00:08:07.948 --> 00:08:08.992 line:15% 
sticks his head in the window

247
00:08:08.992 --> 00:08:11.670 line:15% 
and says, "You caused your cancer, you can cure it."

248
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.943 line:15% 
And she said well I tried to roll the window up

249
00:08:13.943 --> 00:08:16.021 line:15% 
on his head, but we were all...

250
00:08:16.021 --> 00:08:17.355 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Not a good, timing was bad.</v>

251
00:08:17.355 --> 00:08:18.902 line:15% 
<v ->Bad. And I said well good idea.</v>

252
00:08:18.902 --> 00:08:19.894 line:15% 
You know, go for it.

253
00:08:19.894 --> 00:08:22.784 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>I mean the second part of that though,</v>

254
00:08:22.784 --> 00:08:24.127 line:15% 
the second part of that statement

255
00:08:24.127 --> 00:08:27.125 line:15% 
is not necessarily defeatist in nature

256
00:08:27.125 --> 00:08:29.056 line:15% 
and you can do something about it.

257
00:08:29.056 --> 00:08:30.965 line:15% 
<v ->Well you can do something but you can't cure it.</v>

258
00:08:30.965 --> 00:08:32.640 line:15% 
That is, I'll tell you something.

259
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.954 line:15% 
I did my original survival study

260
00:08:34.954 --> 00:08:37.162 line:15% 
because of the Simonton

261
00:08:37.162 --> 00:08:39.178 line:15% 
you know, guided imagery for cancer stuff

262
00:08:39.178 --> 00:08:40.075 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

263
00:08:40.075 --> 00:08:40.639 line:15% 
<v ->That was in the 80's.</v>

264
00:08:40.639 --> 00:08:42.507 line:15% 
So we did the original studies in the 1970's.

265
00:08:42.507 --> 00:08:44.585 line:15% 
It was strictly about, you know

266
00:08:44.585 --> 00:08:46.121 line:15% 
growth, personal growth

267
00:08:46.121 --> 00:08:48.019 line:15% 
and reducing anxiety and depression.

268
00:08:48.019 --> 00:08:49.641 line:15% 
And we found that we published papers

269
00:08:49.641 --> 00:08:50.985 line:15% 
in the early 80's about that.

270
00:08:50.985 --> 00:08:52.510 line:15% 
And then there were all these people

271
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.271 line:15% 
being told wish away your cancer.

272
00:08:54.271 --> 00:08:56.158 line:15% 
So you just picture your white cells

273
00:08:56.158 --> 00:08:56.916 line:15% 
killing your cancer cells.

274
00:08:56.916 --> 00:09:00.691 line:15% 
And Simonton called Getting Well Again

275
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:02.334 line:15% 
The evidence for that book

276
00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:03.859 line:15% 
was in the introductory chapter.

277
00:09:03.859 --> 00:09:06.952 line:15% 
Said that people who came to the Simonton ranch

278
00:09:06.952 --> 00:09:10.836 line:15% 
lived twice as long as the same kinds of diseases

279
00:09:10.836 --> 00:09:13.202 line:15% 
who hadn't come to the ranch

280
00:09:13.202 --> 00:09:14.813 line:15% 
and therefore he was extending survival.

281
00:09:14.813 --> 00:09:17.511 line:15% 
And I thought, well that's ridiculous.

282
00:09:17.511 --> 00:09:18.386 line:15% 
You know, that's bogus.

283
00:09:18.386 --> 00:09:19.591 line:15% 
Because obviously the kind of people

284
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:22.204 line:15% 
who have the energy, knowledge and money

285
00:09:22.204 --> 00:09:25.340 line:15% 
to go travel to the ranch are not typical

286
00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.123 line:15% 
of people with that kind of disease.

287
00:09:28.123 --> 00:09:29.681 line:15% 
So it's obvious patient selection.

288
00:09:29.681 --> 00:09:30.684 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>That's true too. Yeah.</v>

289
00:09:30.684 --> 00:09:31.858 line:15% 
<v ->And there were no randomized trials.</v>

290
00:09:31.858 --> 00:09:33.926 line:15% 
Stephanie Matthews Simonton tried to do a small

291
00:09:33.926 --> 00:09:35.900 line:15% 
randomized trial, nothing much came of it.

292
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.766 line:15% 
So, I thought it's unfair to people

293
00:09:37.766 --> 00:09:39.699 line:15% 
that you're telling them

294
00:09:39.732 --> 00:09:40.973 line:15% 
that they can cure their cancer

295
00:09:40.973 --> 00:09:41.912 line:15% 
when they can't.

296
00:09:41.912 --> 00:09:43.047 line:15% 
And even in our intervention

297
00:09:43.047 --> 00:09:44.690 line:15% 
we're not telling them.

298
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.077 line:15% 
We're teaching them how to live better

299
00:09:46.077 --> 00:09:47.602 line:15% 
and maybe they'll live longer

300
00:09:47.602 --> 00:09:49.063 line:15% 
but it's not by denying it.

301
00:09:49.063 --> 00:09:50.258 line:15% 
It's not by wishing it away.

302
00:09:50.258 --> 00:09:50.994 line:15% 
It's by facing it.

303
00:09:50.994 --> 00:09:52.988 line:15% 
By dealing with the stress of the disease better.

304
00:09:52.988 --> 00:09:55.377 line:15% 
Not by telling them if you just do the right things

305
00:09:55.377 --> 00:09:57.063 line:15% 
you're going to cure yourself of breast cancer.

306
00:09:57.063 --> 00:09:59.548 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yet at the same time the survival rates</v>

307
00:09:59.548 --> 00:10:01.660 line:15% 
among those who were treated in this way

308
00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:05.702 line:15% 
in this metaphyscianal way actually had

309
00:10:05.702 --> 00:10:08.710 line:15% 
they did experience an increase

310
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.214 line:15% 
not only in the quality of life

311
00:10:10.214 --> 00:10:12.368 line:15% 
but also in the span of their life

312
00:10:12.368 --> 00:10:13.670 line:15% 
in some of these studies, right?"

313
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:14.374 line:15% 
<v ->Well you're right.</v>

314
00:10:14.374 --> 00:10:16.955 line:15% 
In our study much to our surprise,

315
00:10:16.955 --> 00:10:19.984 line:15% 
the treatment group lived significantly longer

316
00:10:19.984 --> 00:10:22.032 line:15% 
on average 18 months longer than the control group.

317
00:10:22.032 --> 00:10:25.573 line:15% 
Now all but three of them died of breast cancer eventually.

318
00:10:25.573 --> 00:10:26.565 line:15% 
So they didn't cure themselves

319
00:10:26.565 --> 00:10:28.197 line:15% 
but they clearly had a better outcome.

320
00:10:28.197 --> 00:10:30.023 line:15% 
There was actually a scene

321
00:10:30.023 --> 00:10:31.364 line:15% 
toward the end of Thirty Something

322
00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:32.474 line:15% 
that I remember

323
00:10:32.474 --> 00:10:35.407 line:15% 
where one of the heroines in the show

324
00:10:35.407 --> 00:10:36.762 line:15% 
got breast cancer

325
00:10:36.762 --> 00:10:39.407 line:15% 
and her husband is desperately trying to cheer her up

326
00:10:39.407 --> 00:10:41.764 line:15% 
and he says, "You know there's a study that shows

327
00:10:41.764 --> 00:10:43.225 line:15% 
that woman randomized through group therapy

328
00:10:43.225 --> 00:10:44.014 line:15% 
live longer.

329
00:10:44.014 --> 00:10:44.846 line:15% 
Join a support group.

330
00:10:44.846 --> 00:10:47.267 line:15% 
And she yells him in the car.

331
00:10:47.267 --> 00:10:48.995 line:15% 
I'm interested listening to this.

332
00:10:48.995 --> 00:10:51.235 line:15% 
She yells at him, "That's not the point."

333
00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:54.136 line:15% 
She said, "The point is they all died.

334
00:10:54.136 --> 00:10:55.619 line:15% 
They may have lived longer but they..."

335
00:10:55.619 --> 00:10:56.920 line:15% 
Actually it wasn't quite right,

336
00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.968 line:15% 
but the idea was not incorrect.

337
00:10:58.968 --> 00:11:03.032 line:15% 
So the point is you can do a lot to help yourself.

338
00:11:03.032 --> 00:11:04.216 line:15% 
You can do a lot to live better

339
00:11:04.216 --> 00:11:05.816 line:15% 
and you might help yourself live longer.

340
00:11:05.816 --> 00:11:08.354 line:15% 
But you're not curing cancer.

341
00:11:08.354 --> 00:11:10.433 line:15% 
You're helping your body deal better

342
00:11:10.433 --> 00:11:12.567 line:15% 
with whatever the cancer is doing.

343
00:11:12.567 --> 00:11:13.378 line:15% 
And that's a good thing.

344
00:11:13.378 --> 00:11:15.308 line:15% 
So, I don't want, you know

345
00:11:15.308 --> 00:11:16.642 line:15% 
I don't want to claim too little

346
00:11:16.642 --> 00:11:18.391 line:15% 
but I don't want to claim too much either

347
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:19.148 line:15% 
for what we did.

348
00:11:19.148 --> 00:11:20.183 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Well you're a realist.</v>

349
00:11:20.183 --> 00:11:21.420 line:15% 
Like you say, you're a realist.

350
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.593 line:15% 
You're dealing with what is

351
00:11:22.593 --> 00:11:23.468 line:15% 
<v ->Right.</v>

352
00:11:23.468 --> 00:11:24.385 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>And you want to help people</v>

353
00:11:24.385 --> 00:11:26.401 line:15% 
straight up deal with what is

354
00:11:26.401 --> 00:11:30.582 line:15% 
and then take the beauty or blessings in the situation.

355
00:11:30.582 --> 00:11:32.470 line:15% 
It sounds more like that's your focus.

356
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:33.345 line:15% 
<v ->Right.</v>

357
00:11:33.345 --> 00:11:36.032 line:15% 
<v ->And the main thing that's really different</v>

358
00:11:36.032 --> 00:11:38.806 line:15% 
from the what was prevalent in pop psychology

359
00:11:38.806 --> 00:11:42.411 line:15% 
is this was not by cultivating optimism

360
00:11:42.411 --> 00:11:43.914 line:15% 
or saying put on a happy face

361
00:11:43.914 --> 00:11:45.354 line:15% 
or laugh your way through the illness.

362
00:11:45.354 --> 00:11:46.528 line:15% 
I mean I knew Norman Cousins.

363
00:11:46.528 --> 00:11:48.725 line:15% 
I really liked him but that's not the point.

364
00:11:48.725 --> 00:11:51.039 line:15% 
The point here is, face what you've got to face.

365
00:11:51.039 --> 00:11:52.458 line:15% 
You know, deal with it

366
00:11:52.458 --> 00:11:53.951 line:15% 
and then find the beauty

367
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:55.690 line:15% 
and the richness of your life

368
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.973 line:15% 
knowing that you're dealing with that stuff

369
00:11:57.973 --> 00:12:01.140 line:15% 
and avoiding it actually hinders your doing that.

370
00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.986 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yes, because you really need to go</v>

371
00:12:02.986 --> 00:12:05.140 line:15% 
through that veil no matter how thick it is,

372
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.057 line:15% 
of tears.

373
00:12:06.057 --> 00:12:09.225 line:15% 
You were saying earlier to be able to cleanse

374
00:12:09.225 --> 00:12:11.785 line:15% 
and calm the being and the mind and the emotions

375
00:12:11.785 --> 00:12:13.086 line:15% 
enough just to be still enough

376
00:12:13.086 --> 00:12:15.379 line:15% 
to look at where the opportunity is

377
00:12:15.379 --> 00:12:16.275 line:15% 
through clearer eyes.

378
00:12:16.275 --> 00:12:17.672 line:15% 
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

379
00:12:17.672 --> 00:12:20.136 line:15% 
If you're wasting all your emotional energy

380
00:12:20.136 --> 00:12:22.921 line:15% 
fending off, you know, the hordes at the gates

381
00:12:22.921 --> 00:12:25.012 line:15% 
that are reminding you that you've got a

382
00:12:25.012 --> 00:12:25.981 line:15% 
life threatening illness,

383
00:12:25.981 --> 00:12:26.781 line:15% 
of course we all do.

384
00:12:26.781 --> 00:12:27.912 line:15% 
I mean, you know,

385
00:12:27.912 --> 00:12:29.096 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>We're born, therefore you die.</v>

386
00:12:29.096 --> 00:12:30.536 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah, yeah, right.</v>

387
00:12:30.536 --> 00:12:33.319 line:15% 
But if you're investing yourself in that

388
00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:34.866 line:15% 
and then trying not to get upset

389
00:12:34.866 --> 00:12:37.384 line:15% 
or being optimistic because people think

390
00:12:37.384 --> 00:12:38.195 line:15% 
that if you're not.

391
00:12:38.195 --> 00:12:40.551 line:15% 
You know, a lot of this is frankly people

392
00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:41.522 line:15% 
are taking care of themselves.

393
00:12:41.522 --> 00:12:43.111 line:15% 
You know, don't get upset about your cancer

394
00:12:43.111 --> 00:12:44.252 line:15% 
because I don't want to deal with it.

395
00:12:44.252 --> 00:12:45.404 line:15% 
That's what it's really about.

396
00:12:45.404 --> 00:12:47.537 line:15% 
And if you can be genuine about it

397
00:12:47.537 --> 00:12:48.999 line:15% 
and say "Look, if you can't deal with it,

398
00:12:48.999 --> 00:12:50.790 line:15% 
sorry that's too bad for you,

399
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.582 line:15% 
but I have to deal with it so I will."

400
00:12:52.582 --> 00:12:54.994 line:15% 
To me that's a much better way of dealing with it

401
00:12:54.994 --> 00:12:57.073 line:15% 
and then you allow yourself to move beyond it.

402
00:12:57.073 --> 00:12:58.203 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Because then you're going into</v>

403
00:12:58.203 --> 00:12:59.014 line:15% 
zones of authenticity.

404
00:12:59.014 --> 00:13:00.988 line:15% 
However that chose itself in a person's life.

405
00:13:00.988 --> 00:13:02.288 line:15% 
<v ->That's right.</v>

406
00:13:02.288 --> 00:13:04.422 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>And you say that one of the things</v>

407
00:13:04.422 --> 00:13:07.312 line:15% 
that obviously has helped tremendously in the study

408
00:13:07.312 --> 00:13:10.171 line:15% 
is the whole essence of connection with other people.

409
00:13:10.171 --> 00:13:11.674 line:15% 
<v ->Right.</v>

410
00:13:11.674 --> 00:13:13.745 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>That this connection is really essential</v>

411
00:13:13.745 --> 00:13:16.933 line:15% 
for human beings for our own levels,

412
00:13:16.933 --> 00:13:18.767 line:15% 
well even people who don't have cancer,

413
00:13:18.767 --> 00:13:21.797 line:15% 
didn't you do a study showing at one point

414
00:13:21.797 --> 00:13:22.874 line:15% 
that people who do not have

415
00:13:22.874 --> 00:13:24.292 line:15% 
the same connectivity with each other

416
00:13:24.292 --> 00:13:26.266 line:15% 
tend to suffer from larger degrees

417
00:13:26.266 --> 00:13:27.461 line:15% 
of depression anyway.

418
00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:29.732 line:15% 
So this connectivity helps across the board.

419
00:13:29.732 --> 00:13:30.447 line:15% 
Doesn't it?

420
00:13:30.447 --> 00:13:31.481 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah, sure.</v>

421
00:13:31.481 --> 00:13:32.537 line:15% 
I mean there are a whole bunch of studies.

422
00:13:32.537 --> 00:13:34.020 line:15% 
Most of them have been done by other people

423
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.726 line:15% 
but they make a very clear point.

424
00:13:35.726 --> 00:13:38.233 line:15% 
Human beings are much more like ants than eagles.

425
00:13:38.233 --> 00:13:41.070 line:15% 
You know, we are much more social creatures

426
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:44.035 line:15% 
that live and die on our ability to interact

427
00:13:44.035 --> 00:13:44.686 line:15% 
with one another

428
00:13:44.686 --> 00:13:46.616 line:15% 
and for whom much of our happiness comes

429
00:13:46.616 --> 00:13:48.696 line:15% 
from interaction with others

430
00:13:48.696 --> 00:13:52.141 line:15% 
then these sort of solo brave creatures

431
00:13:52.141 --> 00:13:55.277 line:15% 
that fly around and do whatever we want by ourselves

432
00:13:55.277 --> 00:13:57.592 line:15% 
and the sad thing is that

433
00:13:57.592 --> 00:13:59.054 line:15% 
when you need social connection more,

434
00:13:59.054 --> 00:14:01.901 line:15% 
when you're sick we often get less of it.

435
00:14:01.901 --> 00:14:02.829 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

436
00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:06.018 line:15% 
<v ->Because people freak out and oh my god cancer you know</v>

437
00:14:06.018 --> 00:14:06.818 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>What do I say to them?</v>

438
00:14:06.818 --> 00:14:08.236 line:15% 
<v ->What do I say you know</v>

439
00:14:08.236 --> 00:14:09.601 line:15% 
or they're afraid to mention the C word, you know.

440
00:14:09.601 --> 00:14:11.831 line:15% 
Like, somebody who has metastatic breast cancer

441
00:14:11.831 --> 00:14:13.399 line:15% 
isn't thinking about cancer every day.

442
00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:14.614 line:15% 
I mean come on, you know.

443
00:14:14.614 --> 00:14:17.014 line:15% 
But people are afraid of dealing with it for themselves.

444
00:14:17.014 --> 00:14:17.889 line:15% 
They're awkward.

445
00:14:17.889 --> 00:14:18.902 line:15% 
They just don't know what to say

446
00:14:18.902 --> 00:14:21.057 line:15% 
and so at at time when you need support more

447
00:14:21.057 --> 00:14:22.699 line:15% 
you often get less of it.

448
00:14:22.699 --> 00:14:24.609 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yeah, and you've also noticed that</v>

449
00:14:24.609 --> 00:14:27.456 line:15% 
when people do take on these new sets of values

450
00:14:27.456 --> 00:14:29.568 line:15% 
because they're in this new situation

451
00:14:29.568 --> 00:14:32.128 line:15% 
that often times it's reaching out

452
00:14:32.128 --> 00:14:33.227 line:15% 
and helping another person

453
00:14:33.227 --> 00:14:35.253 line:15% 
that is maybe the difference

454
00:14:35.253 --> 00:14:36.500 line:15% 
in the quality of their life.

455
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.941 line:15% 
<v ->Well that's exactly right.</v>

456
00:14:37.941 --> 00:14:39.829 line:15% 
Your feeling competent

457
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:43.327 line:15% 
in dealing with a terrible situation

458
00:14:43.327 --> 00:14:46.591 line:15% 
and something genuinely good has come of it

459
00:14:46.591 --> 00:14:49.556 line:15% 
and that is that your'e now learning things

460
00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:52.607 line:15% 
that can help other people coping with the same illness.

461
00:14:52.607 --> 00:14:53.770 line:15% 
And you see that time and again.

462
00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:56.404 line:15% 
You know, Mothers Against Drunk Drivers

463
00:14:56.404 --> 00:14:57.865 line:15% 
you know, mothers who have lost

464
00:14:57.865 --> 00:14:59.817 line:15% 
their children to drunk drivers turn around

465
00:14:59.817 --> 00:15:02.174 line:15% 
and devote much of their lives to try

466
00:15:02.174 --> 00:15:04.105 line:15% 
and at least use it as a way that other people

467
00:15:04.105 --> 00:15:05.364 line:15% 
won't go through the same thing.

468
00:15:05.364 --> 00:15:07.859 line:15% 
The Brady family, after Jim Brady was shot,

469
00:15:07.859 --> 00:15:08.862 line:15% 
handgun control.

470
00:15:08.862 --> 00:15:11.016 line:15% 
Time and again you see people

471
00:15:11.016 --> 00:15:14.163 line:15% 
turning this tragedy in their life into something

472
00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:15.688 line:15% 
that they can use to help something else.

473
00:15:15.688 --> 00:15:17.619 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>And we're here at the happiness conference</v>

474
00:15:17.619 --> 00:15:21.927 line:15% 
and many people in the panels are discussing this

475
00:15:21.927 --> 00:15:23.207 line:15% 
or saying what is happiness

476
00:15:23.207 --> 00:15:25.032 line:15% 
and often they're coming up with the fact

477
00:15:25.032 --> 00:15:27.933
that it is having a life that they consider to be meaninful.

478
00:15:27.933 --> 00:15:28.893 line:15% 
<v ->Right.</v>

479
00:15:28.893 --> 00:15:30.471 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>So could this very tragedy be the very thing</v>

480
00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:32.284 line:15% 
then that is giving that life

481
00:15:32.284 --> 00:15:33.276 line:15% 
the meaning they've been seeking?

482
00:15:33.276 --> 00:15:35.048 line:15% 
<v ->I think that's absolutely right.</v>

483
00:15:35.048 --> 00:15:36.168 line:15% 
That if you don't run from it,

484
00:15:36.168 --> 00:15:38.012 line:15% 
if you don't deny it, if you deal with it,

485
00:15:38.012 --> 00:15:39.335 line:15% 
that, you know, because happy

486
00:15:39.335 --> 00:15:40.699 line:15% 
and you know American, you know,

487
00:15:40.699 --> 00:15:42.460 line:15% 
life, liberty and you know

488
00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:43.558 line:15% 
in France it's interesting.

489
00:15:43.558 --> 00:15:46.278 line:15% 
The motto is Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite.

490
00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:48.273 line:15% 
Liberty, Eqality, Fraternity.

491
00:15:48.273 --> 00:15:49.062 line:15% 
Relationships.

492
00:15:49.062 --> 00:15:50.427 line:15% 
In America it became Life, Liberty

493
00:15:50.427 --> 00:15:51.120 line:15% 
and the pursuit of Happiness.

494
00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.904 line:15% 
And I think, unfortunately,

495
00:15:53.904 --> 00:15:55.547 line:15% 
the more your pursue happiness,

496
00:15:55.547 --> 00:15:56.336 line:15% 
the more it alludes you

497
00:15:56.336 --> 00:16:00.336 line:15% 
and happiness is not an end, it's a means.

498
00:16:00.336 --> 00:16:02.513 line:15% 
That if you are doing things that are meaningful

499
00:16:02.513 --> 00:16:05.221 line:15% 
in life, you will find happiness.

500
00:16:05.221 --> 00:16:06.416 line:15% 
Or happiness will find you.

501
00:16:06.416 --> 00:16:08.015 line:15% 
If you're running around looking for it,

502
00:16:08.015 --> 00:16:10.010 line:15% 
It's going to keep alluding you.

503
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:13.284 line:15% 
And we're just so product and goal oriented,

504
00:16:13.284 --> 00:16:14.949 line:15% 
you know, I'm going to determine to be happy,

505
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:17.849 line:15% 
and to me that's a recipe for emptiness and misery.

506
00:16:17.849 --> 00:16:19.236 line:15% 
It's just not going to happen.

507
00:16:19.236 --> 00:16:21.412 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>There was one other area</v>

508
00:16:21.412 --> 00:16:22.405 line:15% 
I wanted to talk to you about.

509
00:16:22.405 --> 00:16:25.476 line:15% 
About the set up for disease and stress

510
00:16:25.476 --> 00:16:26.606 line:15% 
and depression and so forth

511
00:16:26.606 --> 00:16:27.865 line:15% 
because there's another study that you did

512
00:16:27.865 --> 00:16:30.329 line:15% 
and because you're speaking specifically about

513
00:16:30.329 --> 00:16:31.993 line:15% 
cortisol I wanted to ask you that.

514
00:16:31.993 --> 00:16:35.182 line:15% 
You did their studies looking at what happens

515
00:16:35.182 --> 00:16:37.134 line:15% 
<v ->Right.</v>

516
00:16:37.134 --> 00:16:38.168 line:15% 
<v ->[Voiceover} with cortisol levels with varying.</v>

517
00:16:38.168 --> 00:16:39.587 line:15% 
Can you just give us a brief of what happened

518
00:16:39.587 --> 00:16:40.547 line:15% 
in that study, what you discovered?

519
00:16:40.547 --> 00:16:41.379 line:15% 
<v ->Sure.</v>

520
00:16:41.379 --> 00:16:43.821 line:15% 
The main idea is that one of the things about stress

521
00:16:43.821 --> 00:16:46.584 line:15% 
is that we have these stress response systems

522
00:16:46.584 --> 00:16:48.120 line:15% 
and one of the primary ones

523
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.925 line:15% 
is a hormone in the blood called cortisol

524
00:16:50.925 --> 00:16:53.101 line:15% 
that basically is there to increase blood sugar

525
00:16:53.101 --> 00:16:54.519 line:15% 
to get you ready to fight or flee.

526
00:16:54.519 --> 00:16:56.439 line:15% 
So your brain is working.

527
00:16:56.439 --> 00:16:57.676 line:15% 
Your muscles are ready to go.

528
00:16:57.676 --> 00:17:01.004 line:15% 
And obviously if you have the cortisol

529
00:17:01.004 --> 00:17:02.689 line:15% 
turned on all the time it would be like

530
00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:04.503 line:15% 
racing the engine in your car or all the time.

531
00:17:04.503 --> 00:17:06.508 line:15% 
When you needed the gas you wouldn't have it.

532
00:17:06.508 --> 00:17:09.718 line:15% 
So, we need a system that quickly

533
00:17:09.718 --> 00:17:11.446 line:15% 
turns itself on when you're stressed

534
00:17:11.446 --> 00:17:13.516 line:15% 
but then turns itself off when you're not.

535
00:17:13.516 --> 00:17:16.266 line:15% 
Now, one of the things that happens with people

536
00:17:16.266 --> 00:17:17.579 line:15% 
who are depressed

537
00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.168 line:15% 
or who have post-traumatic stress disorder is

538
00:17:19.168 --> 00:17:22.463 line:15% 
that their cortisol regulation is out of wack.

539
00:17:22.463 --> 00:17:24.512 line:15% 
And so they'll have cort on all the time.

540
00:17:24.512 --> 00:17:27.722 line:15% 
Typically for example, waking up is a daily stress task

541
00:17:27.722 --> 00:17:29.770 line:15% 
and our cortisol levels are four times

542
00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:32.373 line:15% 
as high in the morning as they are in the evening normally

543
00:17:32.373 --> 00:17:34.218 line:15% 
and you've go to do that to get your body

544
00:17:34.218 --> 00:17:35.583 line:15% 
ready to deal with the day.

545
00:17:35.583 --> 00:17:38.367 line:15% 
But we found that a substantial portion,

546
00:17:38.367 --> 00:17:41.375 line:15% 
about two thirds of or metastatic breast cancer patients

547
00:17:41.375 --> 00:17:42.815 line:15% 
had these abnormal cort patterns.

548
00:17:42.815 --> 00:17:44.319 line:15% 
Where instead of being high in the morning

549
00:17:44.319 --> 00:17:45.108 line:15% 
and going down in the evening,

550
00:17:45.108 --> 00:17:46.207 line:15% 
it was high throughout the day

551
00:17:46.207 --> 00:17:47.647 line:15% 
or would start low and actually increase.

552
00:17:47.647 --> 00:17:50.313 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Doesn't this defeat the immune system?</v>

553
00:17:50.313 --> 00:17:51.657 line:15% 
<v ->Well, that's a good point.</v>

554
00:17:51.657 --> 00:17:56.201 line:15% 
So glucocorticoids are potently immunosuppressive.

555
00:17:56.201 --> 00:17:58.686 line:15% 
That's why we use them to treat autoimmune disease,

556
00:17:58.686 --> 00:17:59.795 line:15% 
like arthritis for example.

557
00:17:59.795 --> 00:18:01.768 line:15% 
Very powerful way of suppressing immunity.

558
00:18:01.768 --> 00:18:04.638 line:15% 
The immune story with cancer is complicated.

559
00:18:04.638 --> 00:18:08.297 line:15% 
But there are certain cells like natural killer cells

560
00:18:08.297 --> 00:18:10.706 line:15% 
that are lower in women

561
00:18:10.706 --> 00:18:12.434 line:15% 
who have these abnormal cortisol patterns

562
00:18:12.434 --> 00:18:16.093 line:15% 
that also do in fact help the body to fight cancer.

563
00:18:16.093 --> 00:18:18.674 line:15% 
To identify and fight transformed and dying cells.

564
00:18:18.674 --> 00:18:21.820 line:15% 
And so what we found was that the women

565
00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.794 line:15% 
who has the more abnormal cortisol patterns

566
00:18:23.794 --> 00:18:26.289 line:15% 
actually died significantly sooner

567
00:18:26.289 --> 00:18:27.793 line:15% 
than the ones who had normal patterns,

568
00:18:27.793 --> 00:18:30.299 line:15% 
independent of all the other risk factors we know about.

569
00:18:30.299 --> 00:18:34.502 line:15% 
And the psychologist who was the first author

570
00:18:34.502 --> 00:18:36.753 line:15% 
on that paper is now at the University of Louisville.

571
00:18:36.753 --> 00:18:39.195 line:15% 
Sandy Ceftin has just found that the same is true

572
00:18:39.195 --> 00:18:40.006 line:15% 
for lung cancer.

573
00:18:40.006 --> 00:18:42.651 line:15% 
So, and there is another group

574
00:18:42.651 --> 00:18:43.504 line:15% 
that has found it for GI cancer.

575
00:18:43.504 --> 00:18:46.938 line:15% 
So it seems pretty clear that this disrupted stress hormone

576
00:18:46.938 --> 00:18:51.216 line:15% 
pattern is indicative of the body's having difficulty

577
00:18:51.216 --> 00:18:54.042 line:15% 
fighting off the cancer and you'll die sooner

578
00:18:54.042 --> 00:18:55.654 line:15% 
if you have the abnormal patterns.

579
00:18:55.654 --> 00:18:56.826 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Do you have any recommendations</v>

580
00:18:56.826 --> 00:18:59.023 line:15% 
then as to from your point of view

581
00:18:59.023 --> 00:19:01.882 line:15% 
how one starts dealing with those levels of cortisol?

582
00:19:01.882 --> 00:19:04.239 line:15% 
<v ->Well for starters, do what my grandmother said,</v>

583
00:19:04.239 --> 00:19:06.618 line:15% 
you know, eat well, sleep well and get plenty of exercise.

584
00:19:06.618 --> 00:19:09.711 line:15% 
I think we burn it at both ends most of the time anyway.

585
00:19:09.711 --> 00:19:13.221 line:15% 
And when you have cancer you got even more stuff

586
00:19:13.221 --> 00:19:14.649 line:15% 
to deal with, you know.

587
00:19:14.649 --> 00:19:18.041 line:15% 
Insurance paperwork and making your appointments

588
00:19:18.041 --> 00:19:20.067 line:15% 
and getting your treatments and trying to do your job

589
00:19:20.067 --> 00:19:21.657 line:15% 
and care for your family and whatever.

590
00:19:21.657 --> 00:19:24.376 line:15% 
So I think, you know and many of my cancer patients

591
00:19:24.376 --> 00:19:26.083 line:15% 
are like human shock absorbers.

592
00:19:26.083 --> 00:19:27.672 line:15% 
You know, they just take on anything.

593
00:19:27.672 --> 00:19:32.237 line:15% 
And cancer, you know, is one way of telling your

594
00:19:32.237 --> 00:19:33.197 line:15% 
that your body has its limits

595
00:19:33.197 --> 00:19:34.638 line:15% 
and so respect those limits.

596
00:19:34.638 --> 00:19:35.554 line:15% 
Get the help you need

597
00:19:35.554 --> 00:19:38.413 line:15% 
and also deal with the stressors of the disease head on

598
00:19:38.413 --> 00:19:41.463 line:15% 
and get the emotional support you need in doing it.

599
00:19:41.463 --> 00:19:42.317 line:15% 
And so I think all of those things together

600
00:19:42.317 --> 00:19:44.226 line:15% 
are better ways of coping with that stress

601
00:19:44.226 --> 00:19:47.094 line:15% 
and hopefully helping your body cope better

602
00:19:47.094 --> 00:19:48.514 line:15% 
with the effects of that stress.

603
00:19:48.514 --> 00:19:50.135 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>You ended your talk today with</v>

604
00:19:50.135 --> 00:19:52.856
hope, healing and happiness in big letters.

605
00:19:52.856 --> 00:19:53.708 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah.</v>

606
00:19:53.708 --> 00:19:54.689 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>So everything capitalized.</v>

607
00:19:54.689 --> 00:19:55.436 line:15% 
Any final comments?

608
00:19:55.436 --> 00:19:58.305 line:15% 
<v ->Well, I just think that hope, healing and happiness</v>

609
00:19:58.305 --> 00:19:59.243 line:15% 
can go together.

610
00:19:59.243 --> 00:20:02.710 line:15% 
That the goal is to prepare for the best,

611
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:04.950 line:15% 
prepare for the worst but hope for the best.

612
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:09.131 line:15% 
That people who are facing even life threatening illnesses

613
00:20:09.131 --> 00:20:11.200 line:15% 
like cancer can lead very meaningful lives.

614
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:11.915 line:15% 
Rich lives.

615
00:20:11.915 --> 00:20:13.216 line:15% 
They can help other people

616
00:20:13.216 --> 00:20:16.875 line:15% 
and that's what, you know, life is all about anyway.

617
00:20:16.875 --> 00:20:18.965 line:15% 
So I think when you have illnesses like cancer,

618
00:20:18.965 --> 00:20:22.241 line:15% 
you kind of do that in a more intense way

619
00:20:22.241 --> 00:20:24.821 line:15% 
but that can be a very exciting period of life too.

620
00:20:24.821 --> 00:20:26.687 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Thank you for your time.</v>

621
00:20:26.687 --> 00:20:27.583 line:15% 
<v ->You're welcome.</v>

622
00:20:27.583 --> 00:20:31.519 line:15% 
<v ->To delve further into the link between cancer</v>

623
00:20:31.519 --> 00:20:33.087 line:15% 
and our emotions, you may also

624
00:20:33.087 --> 00:20:34.996 line:15% 
want to take at look at our interviews

625
00:20:34.996 --> 00:20:35.967 line:15% 
with Dr. Lorraine Day.

626
00:20:35.967 --> 00:20:38.590 line:15% 
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
