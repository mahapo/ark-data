00:00:00.607 --> 00:00:03.741
<v ->You may recognize this man's face from the documentary</v>

2
00:00:03.741 --> 00:00:05.684
What the Bleep Do We Know!?

3
00:00:05.684 --> 00:00:07.476
He is physicist Amit Goswami.

4
00:00:07.476 --> 00:00:09.034
In our interview with Dr. Goswami

5
00:00:09.034 --> 00:00:11.230
we discuss everything from what God is

6
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.929
to why our civilization has been stalled out

7
00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.787
in its evolution for the past 2,700 years,

8
00:00:16.787 --> 00:00:18.483
to the modern interpretation

9
00:00:18.483 --> 00:00:20.936
of the Tibetan Book of the Dead, and reincarnation.

10
00:00:20.936 --> 00:00:24.638
All of which is featured in his book, Physics of the Soul.

11
00:00:24.638 --> 00:00:27.805
And he also explains that we cannot evolve as a species

12
00:00:27.805 --> 00:00:30.259
until we move away from negative emotions

13
00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.210
toward a life ordered by happiness rather than pleasure.

14
00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:44.775
<v Voiceover>I like a the description you gave</v>

15
00:00:44.775 --> 00:00:47.153
in your lecture I heard just a little while ago

16
00:00:47.153 --> 00:00:48.775
about what God is.

17
00:00:48.775 --> 00:00:50.875
If you can say it again for everybody,

18
00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:52.369
that would be wonderful

19
00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:54.876
and that's going to be our starting place.

20
00:00:54.876 --> 00:00:56.624
<v ->Well, we start with something</v>

21
00:00:56.624 --> 00:00:58.225
that is very easy to understand,

22
00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:01.414
we start with the idea that there is an interconnectedness

23
00:01:01.414 --> 00:01:04.219
in consciousness between all sunshine beings,

24
00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:08.100
especially us, human beings, and God,

25
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.319
our non-local consciousness,

26
00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:13.537
as we call it more objectively,

27
00:01:13.537 --> 00:01:15.734
is that inteconnectedness.

28
00:01:15.734 --> 00:01:18.215
This is the easiest thing to remember.

29
00:01:18.215 --> 00:01:21.442
But if the tendency develops that the interconnectedness

30
00:01:21.442 --> 00:01:24.985
is within space, then a part that tendency.

31
00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:28.803
It is the interconnectedness that transcends space and time,

32
00:01:28.803 --> 00:01:32.344
is that transcendental interconnectedness,

33
00:01:32.344 --> 00:01:35.086
which we in quantum physics call non-local,

34
00:01:35.086 --> 00:01:38.456
a signal less interconnected that does not require

35
00:01:38.456 --> 00:01:40.920
any signals, energy carrying signal

36
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.842
to the space and time for communication.

37
00:01:46.332 --> 00:01:50.239
This is the most important and most visual aspect

38
00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:53.066
of the new definition of God

39
00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:55.742
that is coming out of quantum physics,

40
00:01:55.742 --> 00:01:59.284
but even more evocatively,

41
00:01:59.284 --> 00:02:02.443
in quantum physics we look at objects

42
00:02:02.443 --> 00:02:04.843
as quantum possibilities,

43
00:02:04.843 --> 00:02:07.264
and a little bit of thinking shows us

44
00:02:07.264 --> 00:02:09.622
that these are quantum possibilities

45
00:02:09.622 --> 00:02:12.223
within this non-local consciousness

46
00:02:12.223 --> 00:02:16.079
for consciousness to choose from.

47
00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.064
So, in this way we have been looking

48
00:02:20.064 --> 00:02:22.510
for God's causation,

49
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.601
causal power for a long time,

50
00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:28.020
how is it exactly that God influences the world.

51
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.497
Now we know that how that influence occurs

52
00:02:31.497 --> 00:02:34.697
is through this downward causation,

53
00:02:34.697 --> 00:02:38.494
the choice from quantum possibilities.

54
00:02:38.494 --> 00:02:42.515
It is God that chooses the actual eventum experience

55
00:02:42.515 --> 00:02:45.366
from quantum possibilities.

56
00:02:46.054 --> 00:02:47.515
<v Voiceover>Let's take that on</v>

57
00:02:47.515 --> 00:02:51.042
to an individuated soul level,

58
00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:55.500
where we have this field of quantum possibilities,

59
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.293
and let's say, if you will take us on a quantum,

60
00:02:59.293 --> 00:03:02.930
a non-local quantum soul journey

61
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.777
through the experience of earth life

62
00:03:05.777 --> 00:03:08.433
from the initial stage,

63
00:03:08.433 --> 00:03:10.492
which means there must be a choice,

64
00:03:10.492 --> 00:03:13.617
as in individuated soul to incarnate

65
00:03:13.617 --> 00:03:15.857
or into a continue incarnating soul,

66
00:03:15.857 --> 00:03:18.246
obviously we're going to have patterns that come with that

67
00:03:18.246 --> 00:03:19.793
and preferences and such,

68
00:03:19.793 --> 00:03:22.289
if we're talking reincarnation, for example.

69
00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:25.019
So let's just isolate it to one life

70
00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.341
where we have a soul

71
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:29.879
with these possibilities

72
00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.087
to be collapsed or chosen

73
00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:34.284
that's going to create an incarnation

74
00:03:34.284 --> 00:03:35.874
and the beginning of the connection

75
00:03:35.874 --> 00:03:37.495
with the fetus even,

76
00:03:37.495 --> 00:03:40.140
and the experiments that Helen Wambach

77
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.804
conducted regarding this,

78
00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:44.225
I found that very interesting.

79
00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:46.209
<v ->You are asking, in other words,</v>

80
00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.512
a modern version of Tibetan Book of the Dead,

81
00:03:48.512 --> 00:03:50.497
which takes us through these bardos of life

82
00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:53.686
and bardos of death gateways, passageways.

83
00:03:53.686 --> 00:03:56.779
Surprisingly, quantum physics helps us

84
00:03:56.779 --> 00:04:00.234
to construct such a picture.

85
00:04:00.234 --> 00:04:02.549
So, at birth...

86
00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.885
But birth here is a little bit tricky,

87
00:04:04.885 --> 00:04:07.711
because what happens to the fetus,

88
00:04:07.711 --> 00:04:11.381
the embryo that we are born as,

89
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:14.186
that is just a single cell birth.

90
00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:18.090
So, single cells don't carry much of what

91
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.257
is in the previous incarnation.

92
00:04:21.257 --> 00:04:24.788
So there is not much ongoing continuity as of yet.

93
00:04:24.788 --> 00:04:27.860
But as this single cell forms multiple cells

94
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.667
and progresses a few more weeks

95
00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:35.933
and the fetus starts forming with organs,

96
00:04:35.933 --> 00:04:40.559
gradually the vital components of the soul

97
00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:45.768
start manifesting, start being represented.

98
00:04:45.768 --> 00:04:50.183
The mental components of the soul do not manifest

99
00:04:50.183 --> 00:04:54.375
until probably the 14th or the 16th week

100
00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:57.094
with the formation of the brain.

101
00:04:57.094 --> 00:04:59.195
At that point only you can really say

102
00:04:59.195 --> 00:05:02.011
that the soul has started,

103
00:05:02.011 --> 00:05:04.923
the soul that is continuing through

104
00:05:04.923 --> 00:05:08.411
birth, death, rebirth cycle,

105
00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:11.778
that soul has fully manifested

106
00:05:11.778 --> 00:05:13.667
in this fetus.

107
00:05:13.667 --> 00:05:15.053
<v Voiceover>And that's interesting</v>

108
00:05:15.053 --> 00:05:18.040
because there's been of course the both age-old

109
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.264
and continuing argument as to when life begins,

110
00:05:22.264 --> 00:05:25.697
an individual conscious life begins.

111
00:05:25.697 --> 00:05:27.948
And in the experiment you wrote about

112
00:05:27.948 --> 00:05:31.265
with Helen Wambach in the Past Life Regressions

113
00:05:31.265 --> 00:05:34.818
many of the participants of the regressions were Christian,

114
00:05:34.818 --> 00:05:37.504
some were devout Catholics.

115
00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:40.811
The consensus seemed to come in around the sixth month mark,

116
00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:44.587
is where the soul really started having the true connection

117
00:05:44.587 --> 00:05:48.128
with the physical in uterine body.

118
00:05:48.128 --> 00:05:50.026
<v ->And that could be understood,</v>

119
00:05:50.026 --> 00:05:51.713
because until the fourth month,

120
00:05:51.713 --> 00:05:53.697
the brain doesn't event develop.

121
00:05:53.697 --> 00:05:56.179
Until the sixth month really

122
00:05:56.179 --> 00:05:58.979
the full fledged developmental process

123
00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.785
of what we call a human being,

124
00:06:01.785 --> 00:06:05.713
a human species, a definite percent of human species,

125
00:06:05.713 --> 00:06:08.767
that doesn't show up until about the sixth month.

126
00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:12.094
So I think that is very good verification

127
00:06:12.094 --> 00:06:15.987
of when really we can say the human life begins.

128
00:06:15.987 --> 00:06:19.240
Life begins no doubt, the single cell is also alive

129
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.138
and certainly life begins there,

130
00:06:21.138 --> 00:06:24.309
but the soul has not entered it yet,

131
00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:28.133
whereas soul begins entering a bit later,

132
00:06:28.133 --> 00:06:30.875
maybe one week, two weeks, three weeks,

133
00:06:30.875 --> 00:06:32.933
whatever we say, gradually.

134
00:06:32.933 --> 00:06:36.666
Some of the morphogenetic fields that are involved

135
00:06:36.666 --> 00:06:38.703
in the vital part of the soul,

136
00:06:38.703 --> 00:06:40.773
that takes place in a few weeks

137
00:06:40.773 --> 00:06:44.349
going to all the way to 16th week

138
00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:47.800
when the even the mental part starts coming in.

139
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.760
But full-fledged,

140
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.197
complete soul

141
00:06:54.197 --> 00:06:57.172
can be said to manifest

142
00:06:57.172 --> 00:06:59.305
only about 6 months,

143
00:06:59.305 --> 00:07:02.377
I think that's a good number to think of.

144
00:07:02.377 --> 00:07:04.201
<v Voiceover>Then what happens in the actual</v>

145
00:07:04.201 --> 00:07:06.323
birth process from there?

146
00:07:06.323 --> 00:07:09.085
<v ->So, the actual birth process is indeed,</v>

147
00:07:09.085 --> 00:07:11.625
there is an impact on many people

148
00:07:11.625 --> 00:07:14.814
like Stan Grof talk about the birth-canal experience

149
00:07:14.814 --> 00:07:17.086
as a traumatic change,

150
00:07:17.086 --> 00:07:19.955
and there is a good reason to think

151
00:07:19.955 --> 00:07:21.555
that it is a traumatic change,

152
00:07:21.555 --> 00:07:24.882
because the first birth is taking place in the uterus.

153
00:07:24.882 --> 00:07:28.114
So, it is a very different environment

154
00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:30.375
than again going to the birth canal

155
00:07:30.375 --> 00:07:34.257
and having birth in air,

156
00:07:35.617 --> 00:07:37.477
which is separate from mother's womb,

157
00:07:37.477 --> 00:07:39.568
that is a very, very difficult process

158
00:07:39.568 --> 00:07:42.052
that the fetus goes through.

159
00:07:43.644 --> 00:07:44.982
<v Voiceover>What proffers breath</v>

160
00:07:44.982 --> 00:07:47.339
that, for example, once you've made your appearance

161
00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:49.515
into the world and the first breath happens,

162
00:07:49.515 --> 00:07:53.579
what's happening with that non-local aspect of self?

163
00:07:53.579 --> 00:07:56.000
<v ->I think the first birth is very interesting</v>

164
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.306
from the non-local point of view,

165
00:07:58.306 --> 00:07:59.786
because here was the fetus

166
00:07:59.786 --> 00:08:01.885
when there was no division

167
00:08:01.885 --> 00:08:04.306
with the consciousness of the mother.

168
00:08:04.306 --> 00:08:06.376
It was definitely, you know, both of them

169
00:08:06.376 --> 00:08:08.960
lived literally in a symbiosis,

170
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.222
two lives in one life.

171
00:08:13.222 --> 00:08:16.006
And all of a sudden that connection is severed.

172
00:08:16.006 --> 00:08:19.142
So again, life begins pretty justifiably

173
00:08:19.142 --> 00:08:20.944
with that first breath,

174
00:08:20.944 --> 00:08:22.634
that is also completely justified

175
00:08:22.634 --> 00:08:26.458
because that's when individual life,

176
00:08:26.458 --> 00:08:29.711
separate from the mother, begins.

177
00:08:29.711 --> 00:08:32.985
So, we are not wrong in saying that is the birth time,

178
00:08:32.985 --> 00:08:35.705
the birth astrologically that is very significant

179
00:08:35.705 --> 00:08:37.496
and all that is correct,

180
00:08:37.496 --> 00:08:39.427
because that indeed is the beginning

181
00:08:39.427 --> 00:08:42.801
of the individual journey of the soul.

182
00:08:43.564 --> 00:08:45.804
<v Voiceover>When you start watching</v>

183
00:08:45.804 --> 00:08:47.755
the child develop,

184
00:08:47.755 --> 00:08:50.907
you start seeing propensities of behavior,

185
00:08:51.734 --> 00:08:53.703
you can even have twins,

186
00:08:53.703 --> 00:08:55.418
the exact same stimuli,

187
00:08:55.418 --> 00:08:58.169
same environment, same nurture,

188
00:08:58.169 --> 00:09:00.767
very, very different paths of progression.

189
00:09:00.767 --> 00:09:03.530
Can you talk about this and its imprint

190
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.559
and patterns that are brought through

191
00:09:06.559 --> 00:09:09.731
with a non-local aspect of self or the soul?

192
00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.903
<v ->This is very interesting because what happens</v>

193
00:09:12.903 --> 00:09:15.500
is definitely, if we watch

194
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.272
child development,

195
00:09:18.272 --> 00:09:19.734
one thing is very clear,

196
00:09:19.734 --> 00:09:22.571
no child is born or hardly any child,

197
00:09:22.571 --> 00:09:25.259
there is past differences here,

198
00:09:25.259 --> 00:09:28.427
but the majority of children certainly are not born

199
00:09:28.427 --> 00:09:30.987
as what is called Tabula Rasa,

200
00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:33.013
it's not an empty slate,

201
00:09:33.013 --> 00:09:36.394
it's certainly can be a very full sledge

202
00:09:36.394 --> 00:09:39.010
in some cases like Mozart,

203
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.864
but it's at least substantially full

204
00:09:43.864 --> 00:09:46.584
for most children

205
00:09:46.584 --> 00:09:49.795
that grow up so very quickly they have abilities

206
00:09:49.795 --> 00:09:53.634
that would take years if they would be learning

207
00:09:53.634 --> 00:09:56.461
from scratch to develop.

208
00:09:56.461 --> 00:09:59.250
So, that itself shows

209
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.810
that there must be propensities

210
00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.687
that are being reincarnated.

211
00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:07.855
In fact, that is one of the best evidence of reincarnation,

212
00:10:07.855 --> 00:10:10.542
that we come with propensities

213
00:10:10.542 --> 00:10:13.549
that one could not have been learned in this life.

214
00:10:13.549 --> 00:10:16.217
People show propensities all the time

215
00:10:16.217 --> 00:10:19.363
where there was no such learning process

216
00:10:19.363 --> 00:10:22.007
that went in this life,

217
00:10:22.007 --> 00:10:24.142
but nevertheless they had that capacity,

218
00:10:24.142 --> 00:10:25.741
where did it come from?

219
00:10:25.741 --> 00:10:28.035
See, it must have come from past life,

220
00:10:28.035 --> 00:10:29.701
because some people of course say just

221
00:10:29.701 --> 00:10:31.764
that genes cause everything,

222
00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:33.896
but that is such a preposterous notion

223
00:10:33.896 --> 00:10:35.667
that we don't even need to go very much into it.

224
00:10:35.667 --> 00:10:38.269
Genes are basically instruction for making proteins,

225
00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:42.024
they're not even responsible for building forms

226
00:10:42.024 --> 00:10:44.945
in the formal organs.

227
00:10:44.945 --> 00:10:46.673
<v Voiceover>This is where, for example,</v>

228
00:10:46.673 --> 00:10:49.030
Bruce Lipton's work, Biology of Belief,

229
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.834
as one example of what's actually

230
00:10:51.834 --> 00:10:54.864
forming, creating formation of our characteristics

231
00:10:54.864 --> 00:10:57.114
and such in life.

232
00:10:57.114 --> 00:11:00.815
<v ->Exactly, and even before Bruce--</v>

233
00:11:00.815 --> 00:11:02.574
<v Voiceover>Rupert Sheldrake, yes,</v>

234
00:11:02.574 --> 00:11:04.955
and his morphogenetic fields' work.

235
00:11:04.955 --> 00:11:06.502
One thing you've written

236
00:11:06.502 --> 00:11:08.347
and I really underlined it in your book

237
00:11:08.347 --> 00:11:09.914
Physics of the Soul,

238
00:11:09.914 --> 00:11:11.558
if found quite interesting because its starts getting

239
00:11:11.558 --> 00:11:15.397
into now how much is predetermined versus choice.

240
00:11:15.397 --> 00:11:17.755
And you show some wonderful little drawings

241
00:11:17.755 --> 00:11:20.944
of the karmic wheel: birth-death, birth-death,

242
00:11:20.944 --> 00:11:23.642
birth-death, karma in, karma out,

243
00:11:23.642 --> 00:11:26.874
"karma-cola," I think you called it at one point.

244
00:11:26.874 --> 00:11:30.575
And you wrote a sentence that caught me, which said,

245
00:11:30.575 --> 00:11:33.935
''The greater burden of memory and the greater

246
00:11:33.935 --> 00:11:36.825
''the burden of memory in playback,

247
00:11:36.825 --> 00:11:40.472
''essentially the less freedom of choice we have."

248
00:11:40.472 --> 00:11:42.852
Can you please expand on that,

249
00:11:42.852 --> 00:11:45.475
because that really rings true.

250
00:11:45.475 --> 00:11:48.600
<v ->Yes it is true and what is very interesting</v>

251
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.137
is that burden is avoided

252
00:11:52.137 --> 00:11:54.324
when we reincarnate,

253
00:11:54.324 --> 00:11:57.194
with a trick that has been verified

254
00:11:57.194 --> 00:11:59.754
by some of the data,

255
00:11:59.754 --> 00:12:02.418
by some of the past life regression therapists.

256
00:12:02.418 --> 00:12:05.303
So, the idea is that we develop propensities.

257
00:12:07.243 --> 00:12:10.443
As we develop propensities, patterns of habit,

258
00:12:10.443 --> 00:12:12.917
patterns of habit can become quite heavy,

259
00:12:12.917 --> 00:12:15.626
we become conditioned in a way

260
00:12:15.626 --> 00:12:19.573
that is supportive sometimes for creative work,

261
00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:22.293
but sometimes also quite destructive

262
00:12:22.293 --> 00:12:24.875
of the creative tendencies.

263
00:12:25.735 --> 00:12:29.242
For example, contradictory tendencies,

264
00:12:29.803 --> 00:12:32.064
contradictory belief systems.

265
00:12:32.064 --> 00:12:34.036
If we are too knowledgeable,

266
00:12:34.036 --> 00:12:36.244
it's bound to happen,

267
00:12:36.244 --> 00:12:40.523
because we do not always

268
00:12:41.363 --> 00:12:44.323
develop in an equarant fashion,

269
00:12:44.323 --> 00:12:46.382
specially in the spiritual directions,

270
00:12:46.382 --> 00:12:49.954
we have all kinds of beliefs that are not always compatible.

271
00:12:49.954 --> 00:12:51.907
For example, like we have a belief

272
00:12:51.907 --> 00:12:54.648
that outer creativity is good for me,

273
00:12:54.648 --> 00:12:57.315
mode of creativity meaning creativity in the world,

274
00:12:57.315 --> 00:12:59.853
creativity where one does a definite product.

275
00:12:59.853 --> 00:13:03.272
At the same time I'm attracted to the idea

276
00:13:03.272 --> 00:13:07.572
that we should be spending time

277
00:13:07.572 --> 00:13:09.929
peacefully with ourselves

278
00:13:09.929 --> 00:13:13.940
and not engaging with the outer world.

279
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.737
Beliefs can often be contradictory.

280
00:13:17.737 --> 00:13:19.091
What is happening now

281
00:13:19.091 --> 00:13:21.310
is that we're at a full understanding of spirituality,

282
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:24.862
we find that spirituality consists of both directions.

283
00:13:24.862 --> 00:13:27.912
So this incompatibility, which has flagged

284
00:13:27.912 --> 00:13:30.269
spiritual people for millennia

285
00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:31.890
is finally going away.

286
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.746
Now, what we find is that there are

287
00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:35.602
two directions for spirituality,

288
00:13:35.602 --> 00:13:37.943
and both are important, both are complimentary.

289
00:13:37.943 --> 00:13:40.105
One is personal, we reincarnate

290
00:13:40.105 --> 00:13:42.326
from one life to another, to another

291
00:13:42.326 --> 00:13:46.726
to enrich the personal repertoire of expertise

292
00:13:46.726 --> 00:13:49.374
and knowledge and understanding.

293
00:13:49.374 --> 00:13:51.400
That is one direction of evolution.

294
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.694
But there is also a social direction of evolution,

295
00:13:53.694 --> 00:13:55.646
which is evolution itself,

296
00:13:55.646 --> 00:13:58.312
we evolve as a society, as a spices.

297
00:13:58.312 --> 00:14:01.436
And human beings are still evolving

298
00:14:01.436 --> 00:14:03.856
in the mental direction,

299
00:14:03.856 --> 00:14:05.948
although the biological evolution

300
00:14:05.948 --> 00:14:08.902
of the human being is complete with the brain,

301
00:14:08.902 --> 00:14:13.115
but better and better representations of the mind

302
00:14:13.115 --> 00:14:15.888
can be made in the brain

303
00:14:15.888 --> 00:14:18.949
and this is the direction of future evolution.

304
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:21.083
So what has happened is that we now understand

305
00:14:21.083 --> 00:14:23.713
that both kind of belief systems are important.

306
00:14:26.433 --> 00:14:29.838
But it happens, there are many other contradictions

307
00:14:29.838 --> 00:14:32.056
in our growing up,

308
00:14:32.056 --> 00:14:34.286
and that causes the problem of burden.

309
00:14:34.286 --> 00:14:36.952
It becomes a burden because they become a barrier

310
00:14:36.952 --> 00:14:39.672
to farther our creativity.

311
00:14:39.672 --> 00:14:41.922
So how to give it away?

312
00:14:41.922 --> 00:14:44.344
It's very nice that when we incarnate

313
00:14:44.344 --> 00:14:47.735
we don't bring all of our propensities from past life,

314
00:14:47.735 --> 00:14:51.053
we bring only a portion of them.

315
00:14:51.053 --> 00:14:54.114
<v Voiceover>Yes, and even within an incarnation</v>

316
00:14:54.114 --> 00:14:57.046
there must be ways for us to begin contending

317
00:14:57.046 --> 00:14:59.393
with the carry forward of that burden.

318
00:14:59.393 --> 00:15:00.919
One thing you talk about is the difference

319
00:15:00.919 --> 00:15:04.310
between this kind of active creativity

320
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.060
you spoke of a moment ago

321
00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.724
and fundamental creativity, for example,

322
00:15:07.724 --> 00:15:09.601
the ability to reach up and access

323
00:15:09.601 --> 00:15:12.608
into original types of thought,

324
00:15:12.608 --> 00:15:15.894
truly original types of thought and theories.

325
00:15:15.894 --> 00:15:18.874
How do we break free

326
00:15:18.874 --> 00:15:21.988
of the kind of perpetual motion,

327
00:15:21.988 --> 00:15:24.771
that wheel of karma we talked about,

328
00:15:24.771 --> 00:15:28.431
to a higher range of access of information or knowledge

329
00:15:28.431 --> 00:15:30.190
so that we can start creating

330
00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:32.473
on a fundamentally creative level

331
00:15:32.473 --> 00:15:34.456
our own lives and futures?

332
00:15:34.456 --> 00:15:37.389
<v ->Takes a while, because what happens initially,</v>

333
00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:39.545
of course, the tendencies to be burdened

334
00:15:39.545 --> 00:15:42.627
by this conditioning and forget about creativity.

335
00:15:42.627 --> 00:15:46.011
So those are the first few

336
00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:49.179
reincarnations for most people.

337
00:15:49.179 --> 00:15:53.445
Then we learn to graduate to our situation or creativity,

338
00:15:53.445 --> 00:15:55.354
we're not happy with conditioning,

339
00:15:55.354 --> 00:15:57.615
we get bored with the condition of life.

340
00:15:57.615 --> 00:15:59.951
So now we are empire building

341
00:15:59.951 --> 00:16:02.607
and this is so enticing that this goes out

342
00:16:02.607 --> 00:16:05.636
for many incarnations for most people.

343
00:16:05.636 --> 00:16:09.615
And then gradually we get bored with that also,

344
00:16:09.615 --> 00:16:13.412
and then the idea of fundamental creativity comes to us.

345
00:16:13.412 --> 00:16:16.324
Once we start engaging in fundamental creativity

346
00:16:16.324 --> 00:16:19.001
this is purifying by itself.

347
00:16:19.001 --> 00:16:22.819
What happens is that we lose interest,

348
00:16:22.819 --> 00:16:26.584
we become less and less interested in empire building,

349
00:16:26.584 --> 00:16:29.261
building more and more creative enterprise

350
00:16:29.261 --> 00:16:32.088
on one fundamental idea that we may have.

351
00:16:32.088 --> 00:16:35.192
But still sometimes one gets into it

352
00:16:35.192 --> 00:16:38.466
and difficult to get out of it because one feels a duty.

353
00:16:38.466 --> 00:16:42.199
I mean in a way my present work

354
00:16:42.199 --> 00:16:44.087
is a good example of it,

355
00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:47.607
because it started with a very great notion

356
00:16:47.607 --> 00:16:49.900
that consciousness is the ground of being

357
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.916
and science can be build within it.

358
00:16:51.916 --> 00:16:53.803
But to build such a science

359
00:16:53.803 --> 00:16:55.755
is largely a situational creativity,

360
00:16:55.755 --> 00:16:57.579
not fundamental creativity,

361
00:16:57.579 --> 00:17:00.246
although occasionally there is fundamental creativity

362
00:17:00.246 --> 00:17:02.272
involved with it also.

363
00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:05.013
But I feel it's my duty to do it.

364
00:17:05.013 --> 00:17:07.520
<v Voiceover>So you yourself are giving to it</v>

365
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.685
at the freedom to totally break free?

366
00:17:09.685 --> 00:17:12.714
<v ->No, no, part of my mind wants to get</v>

367
00:17:12.714 --> 00:17:16.458
into engaging to the fundamental level of conscious self

368
00:17:17.438 --> 00:17:19.972
of how to, for example,

369
00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:22.643
become a total loving being,

370
00:17:22.643 --> 00:17:25.155
unconditional love, and I continue to do that research

371
00:17:25.155 --> 00:17:29.294
at a personal and scientific level,

372
00:17:29.294 --> 00:17:33.464
but the focus is also on the external work,

373
00:17:33.464 --> 00:17:36.249
developing this new science, new paradigm.

374
00:17:38.159 --> 00:17:40.970
That just gives you an example of how hard it is.

375
00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:44.352
Because we develop this sense of duty,

376
00:17:44.352 --> 00:17:47.818
we bring that from our past life, I think.

377
00:17:47.818 --> 00:17:50.281
Indians call it Dharma.

378
00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:52.435
<v Voiceover>Can you talk about dharma with the little d</v>

379
00:17:52.435 --> 00:17:54.506
and Dharma with the big D?

380
00:17:54.506 --> 00:17:56.031
<v ->Oh, Dharma with the big D just means</v>

381
00:17:56.031 --> 00:17:57.555
consciousness as a whole,

382
00:17:57.555 --> 00:17:59.262
the best translation known

383
00:17:59.262 --> 00:18:01.128
to the western audience is dough,

384
00:18:01.128 --> 00:18:02.653
dough is Dharma,

385
00:18:02.653 --> 00:18:05.661
Sanskrit name with capital D, Dharma.

386
00:18:05.661 --> 00:18:07.837
But then there's little d dharma,

387
00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:10.024
which is a little more obscure,

388
00:18:10.024 --> 00:18:11.346
there is references to it

389
00:18:11.346 --> 00:18:13.725
in The Bhagavad Gita and other treatises,

390
00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:15.549
what is this dharma?

391
00:18:15.549 --> 00:18:17.223
It is said in the The Bhagavad Gita

392
00:18:17.223 --> 00:18:19.613
that one must pursue one's one dharma

393
00:18:19.613 --> 00:18:22.866
and definitely not adapt to somebody else's dharma,

394
00:18:22.866 --> 00:18:25.671
which is extremely dangerous.

395
00:18:25.671 --> 00:18:28.999
Of course, today we find so may people

396
00:18:28.999 --> 00:18:31.036
pursuing other people's dharma,

397
00:18:31.036 --> 00:18:33.734
you know, most of our learnings come from other people,

398
00:18:33.734 --> 00:18:36.476
this is such a shame, we don't even recognize

399
00:18:36.476 --> 00:18:39.643
that the strong belief to which we create so many troubles,

400
00:18:39.643 --> 00:18:42.779
so much trouble in the world actually other people's belief

401
00:18:42.779 --> 00:18:45.382
that we have taken on from them,

402
00:18:45.382 --> 00:18:48.095
it's not our original belief.

403
00:18:48.095 --> 00:18:51.861
So, anyway, this not following

404
00:18:51.861 --> 00:18:53.995
one personal's dharma

405
00:18:53.995 --> 00:18:56.245
is a dangerous thing,

406
00:18:56.245 --> 00:18:58.912
and today much of the social chaos that is being created

407
00:18:58.912 --> 00:19:02.593
is because more and more people

408
00:19:02.593 --> 00:19:04.385
are falling into the trap

409
00:19:04.385 --> 00:19:06.539
of following somebody else's dharma.

410
00:19:06.539 --> 00:19:08.139
Some charismatic leader comes

411
00:19:08.139 --> 00:19:10.720
and then converts a whole bunch of people

412
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.973
to follow his ko-ran-kor dharma,

413
00:19:13.973 --> 00:19:16.330
whereas these people's personal dharma

414
00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.485
would have taken them elsewhere.

415
00:19:18.485 --> 00:19:20.394
<v Voiceover>But how do we quiet ourselves</v>

416
00:19:20.394 --> 00:19:23.807
in the midst of all of this to be able as a being,

417
00:19:26.367 --> 00:19:28.298
whether it's time to have times of reflection

418
00:19:28.298 --> 00:19:30.186
or be still or quiet enough,

419
00:19:30.186 --> 00:19:32.340
to connect with our individual dharma

420
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:36.116
when we have this societal, familial, etc. conditioning

421
00:19:36.116 --> 00:19:39.081
that sucked us into the karma wheel to begin with?

422
00:19:39.081 --> 00:19:41.544
<v ->This is difficult, obviously one has to distinguish</v>

423
00:19:41.544 --> 00:19:44.361
between what is called bliss or happiness

424
00:19:44.361 --> 00:19:46.067
and what is called pleasure.

425
00:19:46.067 --> 00:19:48.243
There is a lot of pleasure in pleasing somebody,

426
00:19:48.243 --> 00:19:50.781
being in power, dominating others,

427
00:19:50.781 --> 00:19:53.490
even though, it is a mo-rut do-mi-nus,

428
00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.251
and ultimately I don't have power

429
00:19:55.251 --> 00:19:56.712
but I get a little bit of power

430
00:19:56.712 --> 00:19:59.260
by being associated with somebody powerful.

431
00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.608
This is pleasure, this the brain circuits

432
00:20:01.608 --> 00:20:03.197
that give us pleasure,

433
00:20:03.197 --> 00:20:04.637
but it is conditioned.

434
00:20:04.637 --> 00:20:08.253
Eventually the attraction to pleasure must give a way,

435
00:20:08.253 --> 00:20:10.535
give a way to something which is more fundamental,

436
00:20:10.535 --> 00:20:13.052
which is more lasting,

437
00:20:13.052 --> 00:20:14.674
and that is what we call happiness.

438
00:20:14.674 --> 00:20:17.276
Happiness is the connection with the whole.

439
00:20:17.276 --> 00:20:19.292
Happiness is connected with healing,

440
00:20:19.292 --> 00:20:21.297
wholeness, being healthy.

441
00:20:21.297 --> 00:20:24.859
Being happy is being healthy, being wholly.

442
00:20:24.859 --> 00:20:27.601
Those three are intimately connected.

443
00:20:27.601 --> 00:20:30.681
We don't even recognize it when we are searching power,

444
00:20:30.681 --> 00:20:33.002
when we are searching to dominate others

445
00:20:33.002 --> 00:20:35.338
and because of that we are submitting our own dharma,

446
00:20:35.338 --> 00:20:37.321
our own propensities and tendencies

447
00:20:37.321 --> 00:20:39.177
to somebody else's dharma,

448
00:20:39.177 --> 00:20:42.708
to somebody else's agenda and destiny.

449
00:20:44.128 --> 00:20:46.760
So, that is the first distinction we have to achieve.

450
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.203
<v Voiceover>Which is a break that's almost enslavement</v>

451
00:20:49.203 --> 00:20:52.274
to the unhealthy aspect of ego, for lack of a better word.

452
00:20:52.274 --> 00:20:54.002
<v ->For lack of a better word</v>

453
00:20:54.002 --> 00:20:56.477
and because it is pleasurable.

454
00:20:56.477 --> 00:20:59.751
But pleasure invariably, used too much without moderation,

455
00:20:59.751 --> 00:21:02.407
brings pain eventually.

456
00:21:02.407 --> 00:21:05.415
We learn that too late in life

457
00:21:05.415 --> 00:21:08.284
and by that time our propensities

458
00:21:08.284 --> 00:21:10.961
have become very pleasure-oriented,

459
00:21:10.961 --> 00:21:13.382
we have not satisfied our dharma,

460
00:21:13.382 --> 00:21:17.040
we may not even know what we came here for,

461
00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.347
what we wanted to really to do.

462
00:21:20.347 --> 00:21:23.984
So at that step, as soon as you become aware

463
00:21:23.984 --> 00:21:26.182
that I'm not really happy,

464
00:21:26.182 --> 00:21:29.083
in spite of lots of pleasurable activities in my life,

465
00:21:29.083 --> 00:21:31.131
I'm really not happy.

466
00:21:31.131 --> 00:21:34.266
That is the time for every good person to think,

467
00:21:34.266 --> 00:21:38.064
"Okay, let's turn to happiness, what will make me happy?"

468
00:21:38.064 --> 00:21:40.282
This is very important, this is most important

469
00:21:40.282 --> 00:21:42.055
in the soul's journey.

470
00:21:42.055 --> 00:21:43.667
<v Voiceover>Now, is that the beginning then,</v>

471
00:21:43.667 --> 00:21:45.688
would you say, of a) the discovery

472
00:21:45.688 --> 00:21:48.012
to dharma with a little "d," personal dharma,

473
00:21:48.012 --> 00:21:51.671
but also to what you refer to as liberation?

474
00:21:51.671 --> 00:21:54.210
<v ->That is the beginning of the journey towards liberation,</v>

475
00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:56.183
at that point we become interested

476
00:21:56.183 --> 00:21:58.018
in what I call "inner creativity,"

477
00:21:58.018 --> 00:22:00.822
at that point we want to change ourselves.

478
00:22:00.822 --> 00:22:03.435
We have been living one way,

479
00:22:03.435 --> 00:22:05.366
we are not satisfied with that anymore,

480
00:22:05.366 --> 00:22:08.699
we want to live in such a way that fulfillment

481
00:22:08.699 --> 00:22:12.524
comes in terms of wholeness and healing,

482
00:22:13.462 --> 00:22:16.337
separate of these tendencies that I had.

483
00:22:16.337 --> 00:22:18.374
Because any time I am just listening

484
00:22:18.374 --> 00:22:20.485
to my brain circuit and conditioning,

485
00:22:20.485 --> 00:22:22.257
I'm also being separate from the whole,

486
00:22:22.257 --> 00:22:23.984
I'm not using my creativity,

487
00:22:23.984 --> 00:22:26.278
I'm not using God's downward causation

488
00:22:26.278 --> 00:22:28.432
or my free will at all.

489
00:22:28.432 --> 00:22:31.579
Instead, I have surrendered my free will not to God,

490
00:22:31.579 --> 00:22:34.928
but to a living human being,

491
00:22:34.928 --> 00:22:38.810
which is, as I said earlier, dangerous.

492
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:43.055
Dangerous to me and also dangerous for other people also,

493
00:22:43.055 --> 00:22:45.977
because if this is done en masse,

494
00:22:45.977 --> 00:22:48.952
then obviously the movement

495
00:22:48.952 --> 00:22:52.125
of consciousness is not being served.

496
00:22:52.814 --> 00:22:54.947
Now, does that mean this is outside of consciousness?

497
00:22:54.947 --> 00:22:58.637
No, consciousness handles it, but it generally

498
00:22:59.837 --> 00:23:03.308
makes the evolution of consciousness stagnant.

499
00:23:03.308 --> 00:23:06.849
We're not growing anymore as an evolving species.

500
00:23:06.849 --> 00:23:10.358
And this is what is responsible

501
00:23:10.358 --> 00:23:13.003
for some of our social calamities today,

502
00:23:13.003 --> 00:23:16.074
you know, global warming, terrorism,

503
00:23:16.074 --> 00:23:19.296
the breakdown of democracy and capitalism.

504
00:23:19.296 --> 00:23:22.677
All this can be expressed very largely

505
00:23:22.677 --> 00:23:26.693
to this lack of following

506
00:23:26.693 --> 00:23:28.623
personal dharma

507
00:23:28.623 --> 00:23:31.044
on the part of many, many people.

508
00:23:31.044 --> 00:23:33.316
<v Voiceover>And this is, when you look at it en masse,</v>

509
00:23:33.316 --> 00:23:36.388
moving away from the personal development for a moment too,

510
00:23:36.388 --> 00:23:39.487
en masse as a civilization,

511
00:23:39.487 --> 00:23:41.621
you say of the four areas

512
00:23:41.621 --> 00:23:45.013
of development that are commonly recognized

513
00:23:45.013 --> 00:23:46.856
as a census to the feelings

514
00:23:46.856 --> 00:23:50.034
to the mental into the intuitive,

515
00:23:50.034 --> 00:23:51.901
we're stuck in the mental,

516
00:23:51.901 --> 00:23:54.397
and this is an area where we get hung up in this,

517
00:23:54.397 --> 00:23:57.789
this mass karmic wheel as well, isn't it?

518
00:23:57.789 --> 00:24:01.735
Because we're thinking we're finding pleasure,

519
00:24:01.735 --> 00:24:03.687
we're destructing ourselves,

520
00:24:03.687 --> 00:24:05.415
but we're not really plugging in, are we?

521
00:24:05.415 --> 00:24:07.356
<v ->We are not plugging in, we are not recognizing</v>

522
00:24:07.356 --> 00:24:09.510
that this is not the evolutionary movement.

523
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:11.665
Evolutionary movement always takes us

524
00:24:11.665 --> 00:24:14.552
towards greater facility

525
00:24:14.552 --> 00:24:16.922
for what we are doing here,

526
00:24:16.922 --> 00:24:18.722
like processing meaning.

527
00:24:18.722 --> 00:24:22.744
But if the meaning of life, if that is defined so narrowly

528
00:24:22.744 --> 00:24:26.359
as to establish certain creeds and certain beliefs,

529
00:24:26.359 --> 00:24:29.206
without even knowing what those beliefs

530
00:24:29.206 --> 00:24:31.351
mean to me personally,

531
00:24:31.351 --> 00:24:33.751
I'm so detest, so much of a follower

532
00:24:33.751 --> 00:24:35.820
of other people's creed and beliefs,

533
00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.423
that I don't even know what is the origin

534
00:24:38.423 --> 00:24:42.307
of my personal attachment to these beliefs.

535
00:24:42.307 --> 00:24:46.141
So it is a long way from here to there

536
00:24:46.141 --> 00:24:48.765
where everybody becomes aware

537
00:24:48.765 --> 00:24:52.018
of their personal little "d" dharma

538
00:24:52.018 --> 00:24:55.506
and starts acting accordingly,

539
00:24:55.506 --> 00:24:57.746
starts acting with creativity,

540
00:24:57.746 --> 00:24:59.346
that is the first thing,

541
00:24:59.346 --> 00:25:02.055
and then eventually turns to inner creativity.

542
00:25:02.055 --> 00:25:05.095
<v Voiceover>And you, this is something you're working</v>

543
00:25:05.095 --> 00:25:08.935
on a number of different levels right now,

544
00:25:08.935 --> 00:25:12.657
and that is a shift in the morphogenic field

545
00:25:12.657 --> 00:25:15.846
toward an opening of the love centers

546
00:25:15.846 --> 00:25:18.651
of our minds to begin,

547
00:25:20.111 --> 00:25:23.920
is it fair in the parlance of quantum physics

548
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.885
to use the word "entrainment" in this?

549
00:25:26.885 --> 00:25:30.437
To as we individually find our own way

550
00:25:31.917 --> 00:25:34.329
through our dharma, recognizing our dharma,

551
00:25:34.329 --> 00:25:36.174
living our lives in that way,

552
00:25:36.174 --> 00:25:40.300
begin moving into these areas of love and healing that

553
00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:44.852
that begins entraining the larger field to the same,

554
00:25:44.852 --> 00:25:47.209
I mean isn't this a great hope that you're holding out

555
00:25:47.209 --> 00:25:49.343
for society at this time?

556
00:25:49.343 --> 00:25:53.406
<v ->Yes, I have such a hope based on a theory</v>

557
00:25:53.406 --> 00:25:56.532
that started with some ideas of Rupert Sheldrake,

558
00:25:56.532 --> 00:26:00.841
went through a mythological skima of hundred monkeys

559
00:26:00.841 --> 00:26:03.592
generalist effort was under the idea

560
00:26:03.592 --> 00:26:06.334
that if hundred monkeys could learn a trait,

561
00:26:06.334 --> 00:26:08.168
the trait becomes universally established

562
00:26:08.168 --> 00:26:11.069
in all of this monkey species.

563
00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:13.810
Which never really quite happened

564
00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:16.680
in an experimental evidentiary way,

565
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.975
but nevertheless it is a nice myth.

566
00:26:19.975 --> 00:26:23.261
And the idea is that, if enough of us

567
00:26:23.261 --> 00:26:24.967
become aware of our dharma

568
00:26:24.967 --> 00:26:26.759
and start developing through inner creativity

569
00:26:26.759 --> 00:26:30.652
these love circuits, that you're referred to, in our brain,

570
00:26:30.652 --> 00:26:33.212
then we'll be able to balance the negative tendencies

571
00:26:33.212 --> 00:26:35.654
that today affect everyone.

572
00:26:35.654 --> 00:26:39.397
Largely because of our misleading metaphysics

573
00:26:39.397 --> 00:26:42.278
that materialist science has given us,

574
00:26:42.278 --> 00:26:43.942
namely everything is patterned,

575
00:26:43.942 --> 00:26:47.536
there is no causation other than material causation.

576
00:26:47.536 --> 00:26:50.568
That largely because of how

577
00:26:50.568 --> 00:26:52.986
that corrupts our political leader,

578
00:26:52.986 --> 00:26:56.154
how we have a tendency to submit

579
00:26:56.154 --> 00:26:58.265
to somebody charismatic,

580
00:26:58.265 --> 00:27:01.721
submit our own will to that person's will.

581
00:27:01.721 --> 00:27:04.846
All of these things have contributed to a situation

582
00:27:04.846 --> 00:27:07.246
where we are very stuck

583
00:27:07.246 --> 00:27:10.478
with a perversion of the rational process.

584
00:27:10.478 --> 00:27:13.550
Rational process is fine as is,

585
00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:17.758
except that it's easily perverted into following

586
00:27:18.563 --> 00:27:22.286
our negative emotional instinctual tendencies.

587
00:27:22.286 --> 00:27:25.379
What happens is that we start justifying

588
00:27:25.379 --> 00:27:29.101
our behavior when the behavior is clearly clouded

589
00:27:29.101 --> 00:27:31.864
by our negative emotions.

590
00:27:31.864 --> 00:27:34.029
It is not really rational behavior,

591
00:27:34.029 --> 00:27:35.736
but the rationality comes later to justify

592
00:27:35.736 --> 00:27:37.549
whatever crazy insane behavior

593
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:40.578
that we were subjected to

594
00:27:40.578 --> 00:27:42.914
during that period where we are

595
00:27:42.914 --> 00:27:45.250
under that negative emotion.

596
00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:47.223
It's really literally too.

597
00:27:47.223 --> 00:27:48.866
Some leaders of our country, for example,

598
00:27:48.866 --> 00:27:52.801
became very angry when 9/11 took place, justifiably.

599
00:27:52.801 --> 00:27:56.512
It was a very violent, very callous,

600
00:27:56.512 --> 00:27:59.644
extremely evil

601
00:28:01.503 --> 00:28:03.023
happening.

602
00:28:03.381 --> 00:28:05.935
And the immediate reaction

603
00:28:05.935 --> 00:28:08.473
was one of intense anger,

604
00:28:08.473 --> 00:28:11.311
and, of course, fear also in addition.

605
00:28:11.311 --> 00:28:13.572
But to act from that anger and fear

606
00:28:13.572 --> 00:28:16.825
is everything that the human being

607
00:28:16.825 --> 00:28:19.363
is not supposed to do.

608
00:28:19.363 --> 00:28:21.774
You're not supposed to act from this spite place

609
00:28:21.774 --> 00:28:24.824
of anger and fear because our rational judgement

610
00:28:24.824 --> 00:28:27.544
is clouded under those negative emotions.

611
00:28:27.544 --> 00:28:30.295
What happened, however, is that people acted

612
00:28:30.295 --> 00:28:33.363
from this place of negative emotions

613
00:28:33.363 --> 00:28:37.181
and then started a huge number of justifications,

614
00:28:37.181 --> 00:28:40.232
irrational justification of these acts,

615
00:28:40.232 --> 00:28:43.933
which were not really up to par

616
00:28:43.933 --> 00:28:45.660
for the rational mind,

617
00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.793
rational mind should not act that way--

618
00:28:47.793 --> 00:28:49.533
<v Voiceover>And this kept mass karma going</v>

619
00:28:49.533 --> 00:28:50.877
in a very wrong direction--

620
00:28:50.877 --> 00:28:54.375
<v ->This is the mass karma going in terms of all of humanity,</v>

621
00:28:54.375 --> 00:28:58.215
perhaps that, perhaps it is just an aberration

622
00:28:58.215 --> 00:29:01.675
because we have some

623
00:29:01.675 --> 00:29:04.331
sort of evolutionary down

624
00:29:04.331 --> 00:29:07.040
caused by this, you know, pendulum always swings

625
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.131
one way too much.

626
00:29:09.131 --> 00:29:10.731
So, we needed the materialist science

627
00:29:10.731 --> 00:29:12.405
in order to give us quantum physics,

628
00:29:12.405 --> 00:29:13.984
in order to give us scientific methods

629
00:29:13.984 --> 00:29:15.307
to analyze creativity,

630
00:29:15.307 --> 00:29:17.258
in order to give us so many things

631
00:29:17.258 --> 00:29:20.341
that we really need for future movement of evolution,

632
00:29:20.341 --> 00:29:22.645
but the pendulum swings one way too much,

633
00:29:22.645 --> 00:29:25.525
so we became believers in scientific materialism.

634
00:29:25.525 --> 00:29:27.561
That was not necessary.

635
00:29:27.561 --> 00:29:30.666
We could have given up materialism 40-50 years ago,

636
00:29:30.666 --> 00:29:33.534
because the death sentence was already signed

637
00:29:33.534 --> 00:29:35.199
by quantum physics itself,

638
00:29:35.199 --> 00:29:37.854
and that is 75 years old, more than that.

639
00:29:37.854 --> 00:29:39.401
But we didn't give up.

640
00:29:39.401 --> 00:29:41.108
Instead, we've made it stronger

641
00:29:41.108 --> 00:29:43.326
and we've made it almost compulsory

642
00:29:43.326 --> 00:29:45.491
even succeeded, almost succeeded,

643
00:29:45.491 --> 00:29:47.546
except for the last two decades

644
00:29:47.546 --> 00:29:50.715
when the evidence started coming in

645
00:29:50.715 --> 00:29:53.062
in a rapid way

646
00:29:53.062 --> 00:29:55.418
and a theory was available,

647
00:29:55.418 --> 00:29:58.363
we could have become totally materialistic.

648
00:29:58.363 --> 00:30:00.816
But now, of course, substantial number of scientists

649
00:30:00.816 --> 00:30:02.970
and substantial number of researchers

650
00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.306
are finding evidence for the contrary.

651
00:30:05.306 --> 00:30:07.161
So, I don't think it will happen,

652
00:30:07.161 --> 00:30:09.146
paradigm will shift.

653
00:30:09.146 --> 00:30:10.777
<v Voiceover>But it's taken a while.</v>

654
00:30:10.777 --> 00:30:13.028
As I was listening in your lecture a little while ago,

655
00:30:13.028 --> 00:30:14.714
you were talking about the seeds,

656
00:30:14.714 --> 00:30:16.281
the fact that seeds had been sown

657
00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:19.761
for the newer consciousness 2,700 years ago.

658
00:30:19.761 --> 00:30:22.830
And we seem to be stalled out.

659
00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:24.452
<v ->Yes, we have stalled out.</v>

660
00:30:24.452 --> 00:30:26.349
The sages were very clear,

661
00:30:26.349 --> 00:30:27.832
ethics was discovered

662
00:30:27.832 --> 00:30:29.560
in several different parts of the globe

663
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.097
by Moses, by Jesus,

664
00:30:32.097 --> 00:30:34.454
by Socrates and Plato,

665
00:30:34.454 --> 00:30:38.326
by Buddha and preachers of the boi-na-shalts.

666
00:30:40.166 --> 00:30:43.411
So, why haven't we pursued that?

667
00:30:43.411 --> 00:30:46.773
The number of people, proportionately speaking,

668
00:30:46.773 --> 00:30:50.406
that were "enlightened" in those days

669
00:30:50.406 --> 00:30:53.275
has not changed today.

670
00:30:53.275 --> 00:30:55.974
If you take proportionate number percentage,

671
00:30:55.974 --> 00:30:58.395
then it's roughly the same percentage that remains

672
00:30:58.395 --> 00:31:00.870
that becomes enlightened today.

673
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:03.653
And this is what it should not be

674
00:31:03.653 --> 00:31:05.808
if evolution is going on.

675
00:31:05.808 --> 00:31:07.920
So, evolution is stalled.

676
00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.872
<v Voiceover>Do you have any idea why?</v>

677
00:31:09.872 --> 00:31:11.951
<v ->I think it is these instinctual circuits,</v>

678
00:31:11.951 --> 00:31:14.586
we did not incorporate that

679
00:31:14.586 --> 00:31:17.637
in the stage of mental evolution.

680
00:31:17.637 --> 00:31:20.175
Mental evolution is not developing the rational mind,

681
00:31:20.175 --> 00:31:22.490
but we never incorporated

682
00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:25.700
how to deal with negative emotions.

683
00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.125
Negative emotions have to be balanced

684
00:31:28.125 --> 00:31:30.049
with positive emotions.

685
00:31:30.049 --> 00:31:32.833
We came to the new stage too soon.

686
00:31:32.833 --> 00:31:35.532
We should have developed brain circuits

687
00:31:35.532 --> 00:31:38.983
of positive emotions long ago.

688
00:31:38.983 --> 00:31:43.129
We didn't, we moved into the rational mind,

689
00:31:43.129 --> 00:31:47.542
which, of course, is logical, is step-by-step,

690
00:31:47.993 --> 00:31:50.435
and therefore antithetical

691
00:31:50.435 --> 00:31:54.224
to that illogical nature of healing,

692
00:31:54.224 --> 00:31:56.749
and rational mind could not handle it.

693
00:31:56.749 --> 00:31:58.401
To handle it, rational mind

694
00:31:58.401 --> 00:32:00.546
has to surrender to the supra-mental.

695
00:32:00.546 --> 00:32:02.647
So, although our spiritual teachers told us

696
00:32:02.647 --> 00:32:04.716
to surrender to the supra-mental,

697
00:32:04.716 --> 00:32:08.599
our rational mind, more and more it understood science

698
00:32:08.599 --> 00:32:10.871
and understood how to handle

699
00:32:10.871 --> 00:32:14.625
the natural phenomenon outside of us,

700
00:32:14.625 --> 00:32:16.844
more and more it became daring,

701
00:32:16.844 --> 00:32:20.524
daring enough to defy the supra-mental.

702
00:32:20.524 --> 00:32:22.316
And that grew

703
00:32:22.316 --> 00:32:25.874
a kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy

704
00:32:25.874 --> 00:32:28.449
of making the rational mind supreme

705
00:32:28.449 --> 00:32:30.743
and yet slave to the negative emotions.

706
00:32:30.743 --> 00:32:32.812
<v Voiceover>Again, might this be a function of pleasure?</v>

707
00:32:32.812 --> 00:32:34.198
<v ->Yeah, it is.</v>

708
00:32:34.198 --> 00:32:35.820
<v Voiceover>Lack of wisdom, function of pleasure?</v>

709
00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.038
<v ->Lack of wisdom coming from being</v>

710
00:32:38.038 --> 00:32:40.619
too attached to pleasure and pain, the emotions.

711
00:32:40.619 --> 00:32:44.096
We are attached to those negative emotions,

712
00:32:44.096 --> 00:32:45.835
we are attached to pleasure.

713
00:32:45.835 --> 00:32:47.787
We are attached to pleasure even forgetting

714
00:32:47.787 --> 00:32:49.845
that pleasure eventually brings pain.

715
00:32:49.845 --> 00:32:52.363
We are ready to even forget that,

716
00:32:52.363 --> 00:32:56.021
but retain our attachment to pleasure.

717
00:32:56.021 --> 00:32:59.349
And that attachment has to be given up

718
00:32:59.349 --> 00:33:02.698
and in favor of happiness.

719
00:33:02.698 --> 00:33:05.183
But at the same time,

720
00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:08.714
we can do certain things

721
00:33:08.714 --> 00:33:11.967
and evolutionary consciousness takes care of these things

722
00:33:11.967 --> 00:33:14.260
somewhat automatically, fortunately.

723
00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:17.406
So, one or few changes and right thinking begins.

724
00:33:17.406 --> 00:33:20.745
As we think right, as we're thinking

725
00:33:20.745 --> 00:33:22.899
of self-consciousness as a ground of being

726
00:33:22.899 --> 00:33:25.331
and we have non-local interconnectedness,

727
00:33:25.331 --> 00:33:28.022
naturally we are attracted

728
00:33:28.022 --> 00:33:29.938
towards the positive emotions.

729
00:33:29.938 --> 00:33:32.881
Because if you and I are interconnected

730
00:33:32.881 --> 00:33:35.889
and I can be conscious with you,

731
00:33:35.889 --> 00:33:37.734
obviously that is more fun

732
00:33:37.734 --> 00:33:41.040
than just being conscious

733
00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.931
with being with myself,

734
00:33:43.931 --> 00:33:46.331
conscious with myself.

735
00:33:46.331 --> 00:33:49.744
So, this discovery of relationship is a great thing.

736
00:33:49.744 --> 00:33:51.610
And that is happening.

737
00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:54.416
Today while in the relationship arena,

738
00:33:54.416 --> 00:33:57.498
we have a chance of truly developing non-local relationship

739
00:33:57.498 --> 00:33:59.610
with not only one person,

740
00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:02.052
but with the large number of people.

741
00:34:02.052 --> 00:34:05.444
We have a real chance, opportunity

742
00:34:05.444 --> 00:34:08.271
of developing group consciousness like never before.

743
00:34:08.271 --> 00:34:11.279
<v Voiceover>So we're breaking out of our own isolation?</v>

744
00:34:11.279 --> 00:34:13.913
<v ->We are breaking out of that individual isolation</v>

745
00:34:13.913 --> 00:34:15.908
that we are glorifying in our culture.

746
00:34:15.908 --> 00:34:18.670
Even 50 years ago it was

747
00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:21.273
all glorification of rugged individual.

748
00:34:21.273 --> 00:34:23.000
But today we are not,

749
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.072
thanks to feminism, thanks to many

750
00:34:26.072 --> 00:34:28.641
other developments in our culture,

751
00:34:28.641 --> 00:34:32.129
we do not glorify this rugged individual image

752
00:34:32.129 --> 00:34:34.026
as much anymore.

753
00:34:34.026 --> 00:34:37.013
Instead, what we now glorify is that,

754
00:34:37.013 --> 00:34:40.384
you know, internet friendships, groups,

755
00:34:41.804 --> 00:34:43.923
movement to gather--

756
00:34:43.923 --> 00:34:45.950
<v Voiceover>Connectedness.</v>

757
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:47.518
<v ->Connectedness, connectedness.</v>

758
00:34:47.518 --> 00:34:49.022
<v Voiceover>So, let's go back and apply</v>

759
00:34:49.022 --> 00:34:50.302
what we've just been talking about

760
00:34:50.302 --> 00:34:53.715
to a personal journey of the soul going

761
00:34:53.715 --> 00:34:55.891
through this incarnation, the karmic wheel.

762
00:34:55.891 --> 00:34:58.045
Let's say we've been able to break out

763
00:34:58.045 --> 00:35:00.646
of some of the conditioning

764
00:35:00.646 --> 00:35:05.054
that has accrued over multiple lifetimes.

765
00:35:05.054 --> 00:35:07.023
And we're going to take an example of a life

766
00:35:07.023 --> 00:35:09.156
who's jumping off the karmic wheel

767
00:35:09.156 --> 00:35:11.471
prior to leaving this life and going

768
00:35:11.471 --> 00:35:13.316
through the passage of death.

769
00:35:13.316 --> 00:35:16.505
What is that like for that soul,

770
00:35:16.505 --> 00:35:17.668
can you talk about that

771
00:35:17.668 --> 00:35:19.438
breaking free of the karmic wheel?

772
00:35:21.998 --> 00:35:23.467
<v ->Okay, I'll go through with it,</v>

773
00:35:23.467 --> 00:35:25.642
because that is part of the Tibetan Book of the Dead

774
00:35:25.642 --> 00:35:27.509
and, of course, part of our image.

775
00:35:27.509 --> 00:35:30.560
This breaking free has been a major part

776
00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.993
of spiritual traditions for a very long time.

777
00:35:33.993 --> 00:35:37.386
So, the first bardo after death

778
00:35:37.386 --> 00:35:39.391
is supposed to be that breaking free,

779
00:35:39.391 --> 00:35:42.196
if I can die consciously.

780
00:35:42.196 --> 00:35:44.148
If I can immediately take charge

781
00:35:44.148 --> 00:35:46.079
of the fact that the moment of death

782
00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:47.945
is such a liberating moment,

783
00:35:47.945 --> 00:35:50.003
that if I'm or were in that moment,

784
00:35:50.003 --> 00:35:53.416
I come to touch with God as is,

785
00:35:54.916 --> 00:35:58.792
my primary processing awareness.

786
00:35:58.792 --> 00:36:01.629
<v Voiceover>One question, I want to inter-check here,</v>

787
00:36:01.629 --> 00:36:04.583
is it possible to break out of the karmic wheel

788
00:36:04.583 --> 00:36:07.357
while you're living in the incarnation

789
00:36:07.357 --> 00:36:09.276
prior to going through the death experience?

790
00:36:09.276 --> 00:36:10.610
<v ->It is possible.</v>

791
00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:13.170
It is possible and this is called

792
00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:16.402
a complicated Sanskrit term, ni-fi-cul-pa-sa-ma-dre,

793
00:36:16.402 --> 00:36:18.816
in the Hindu tradition,

794
00:36:18.816 --> 00:36:20.986
also called

795
00:36:20.986 --> 00:36:24.175
"liberated while living."

796
00:36:24.865 --> 00:36:27.033
So, that concept is there,

797
00:36:27.033 --> 00:36:29.390
but I also warn you,

798
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:30.879
very few people,

799
00:36:30.879 --> 00:36:34.055
probably countable on our fingers,

800
00:36:34.055 --> 00:36:36.189
Jesus, Buddha, a couple of names

801
00:36:36.189 --> 00:36:38.078
that immediately come to mind,

802
00:36:38.078 --> 00:36:40.758
but not too many names of that ilk.

803
00:36:41.958 --> 00:36:43.419
<v Voiceover>So, mostly this happens,</v>

804
00:36:43.419 --> 00:36:46.907
the liberation occurs at the point of the transition?

805
00:36:46.907 --> 00:36:50.950
<v ->That is a much easier contention,</v>

806
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:52.337
because all you have to do,

807
00:36:52.337 --> 00:36:54.716
well, it's quite difficult, of course,

808
00:36:54.716 --> 00:36:56.848
but still the chances are that you are conscious

809
00:36:56.848 --> 00:36:58.758
at the moment of death,

810
00:36:58.758 --> 00:37:00.816
and that moment is a very non-local moment.

811
00:37:00.816 --> 00:37:02.929
There's much evidence in favor of it.

812
00:37:02.929 --> 00:37:06.075
People report that when some people die,

813
00:37:06.075 --> 00:37:08.367
with such lucidity occurs,

814
00:37:08.367 --> 00:37:09.872
like a lighted being,

815
00:37:09.872 --> 00:37:12.047
like the room becomes full of peace,

816
00:37:12.047 --> 00:37:14.852
and like a lighted being is passing away.

817
00:37:14.852 --> 00:37:17.028
So the understanding is that those beings

818
00:37:17.028 --> 00:37:20.259
are literally experiencing

819
00:37:20.259 --> 00:37:23.706
a liberated oneness of consciousness.

820
00:37:24.526 --> 00:37:27.159
Tibetans call it seeing the clear light,

821
00:37:27.159 --> 00:37:29.066
clear light of consciousness.

822
00:37:29.066 --> 00:37:31.989
So, if the soul recognizes it,

823
00:37:31.989 --> 00:37:34.976
Tibetan Book of the Dead says that soul is liberated.

824
00:37:34.976 --> 00:37:36.949
In the modern version we say that,

825
00:37:36.949 --> 00:37:40.342
well, if the readiness is there then that's it,

826
00:37:40.342 --> 00:37:43.177
this becomes the final death

827
00:37:43.177 --> 00:37:47.299
and there is no more journey of incarnation.

828
00:37:47.878 --> 00:37:51.291
Reincarnation will stop, liberation has taken place.

829
00:37:51.291 --> 00:37:53.586
Now, if the soul doesn't recognize,

830
00:37:53.586 --> 00:37:55.430
in quantum physics to talking about this

831
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:58.524
a little bit risky,

832
00:37:58.524 --> 00:38:00.774
because you have to recognize something.

833
00:38:00.774 --> 00:38:03.628
No longer is there any brain

834
00:38:03.628 --> 00:38:07.531
to manifest possibilities into actual events.

835
00:38:07.531 --> 00:38:10.133
<v Voiceover>This is a big point I wanted to bring up too,</v>

836
00:38:10.133 --> 00:38:11.989
because many people think,

837
00:38:11.989 --> 00:38:14.325
"Oh, this is a harsh place, I can't wait to go

838
00:38:14.325 --> 00:38:17.781
"into the afterlife into my heavenly existence,

839
00:38:17.781 --> 00:38:20.298
"where then everything will be revealed to me

840
00:38:20.298 --> 00:38:22.591
"and I will know and I can create."

841
00:38:22.591 --> 00:38:24.319
You're saying, not true,

842
00:38:24.319 --> 00:38:26.327
certainly not from the quantum view.

843
00:38:26.327 --> 00:38:27.969
<v ->There is no subject-object spirit</v>

844
00:38:27.969 --> 00:38:29.505
or is no manifest consciousness.

845
00:38:29.505 --> 00:38:31.255
There is only possibilities.

846
00:38:31.255 --> 00:38:33.089
<v Voiceover>And can you talk about,</v>

847
00:38:33.089 --> 00:38:35.186
bring that down to just a really simple analogy

848
00:38:35.186 --> 00:38:36.988
that there are only possibilities but nothing

849
00:38:36.988 --> 00:38:40.156
to structure it into an event or a reality.

850
00:38:40.156 --> 00:38:42.556
<v ->It's very difficult to find an analogy for it,</v>

851
00:38:42.556 --> 00:38:45.201
because all analogy will be in terms of manifestation,

852
00:38:45.201 --> 00:38:47.654
so will only create more confusion.

853
00:38:47.654 --> 00:38:49.243
So let's just keep it that way,

854
00:38:49.243 --> 00:38:51.195
that we become beings of possibility.

855
00:38:51.195 --> 00:38:52.955
But all is not lost,

856
00:38:52.955 --> 00:38:55.110
because there is another moment of manifestation,

857
00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:57.616
which is the moment of next birth.

858
00:38:57.616 --> 00:39:00.539
So, things can go on in possibility,

859
00:39:00.539 --> 00:39:03.213
but these possibilities

860
00:39:03.213 --> 00:39:07.053
when they finally manifest

861
00:39:07.053 --> 00:39:09.090
at the moment of birth,

862
00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:12.013
a whole chain of possibilities in the soul's journey

863
00:39:12.013 --> 00:39:13.943
can manifest at that time.

864
00:39:13.943 --> 00:39:16.364
This is the good news.

865
00:39:16.364 --> 00:39:19.819
It is now an experimental fact

866
00:39:19.819 --> 00:39:22.817
that our choice can be delayed.

867
00:39:22.817 --> 00:39:26.187
We choose now, but that may determine something

868
00:39:26.187 --> 00:39:28.810
that was supposed to happen before,

869
00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:31.285
but actually not so in quantum physics.

870
00:39:31.285 --> 00:39:34.197
There remain possibilities before.

871
00:39:34.197 --> 00:39:36.874
So what Tibetans describe as Bardos,

872
00:39:36.874 --> 00:39:40.596
they're possible bardos,

873
00:39:40.596 --> 00:39:44.794
and only manifested at the moment of the next birth.

874
00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:49.013
So, bardo number four is that seeing pure light.

875
00:39:49.013 --> 00:39:51.636
If that happens, next part will never take place

876
00:39:51.636 --> 00:39:53.599
and that is completely compatible.

877
00:39:53.599 --> 00:39:56.767
In the next bardo, Tibetans call it fifth bardo,

878
00:39:56.767 --> 00:39:59.209
they call it the seeing the dim light.

879
00:39:59.209 --> 00:40:02.727
So, if you recognize it and still choose

880
00:40:02.727 --> 00:40:05.694
the no-reincarnation-liberation path,

881
00:40:05.694 --> 00:40:07.582
you are liberated again,

882
00:40:07.582 --> 00:40:11.464
so no manifestation in the next birth,

883
00:40:11.464 --> 00:40:13.832
completely compatible.

884
00:40:13.832 --> 00:40:16.008
And then if you have not recognized,

885
00:40:16.008 --> 00:40:18.248
then you just take birth.

886
00:40:18.248 --> 00:40:20.827
But in that process that describes some

887
00:40:20.827 --> 00:40:25.512
very interesting scenarios that occur

888
00:40:26.297 --> 00:40:27.822
and those are the scenarios

889
00:40:27.822 --> 00:40:30.136
that people sometimes able to remember

890
00:40:30.136 --> 00:40:34.066
as part of their past life memory,

891
00:40:34.066 --> 00:40:38.026
scenarios of heaven, hell that we live through

892
00:40:38.026 --> 00:40:40.763
in possibilities, supposedly.

893
00:40:40.763 --> 00:40:44.133
But when the final moment of birth

894
00:40:44.133 --> 00:40:46.148
takes place with manifestation

895
00:40:46.148 --> 00:40:49.519
some of these possibilities will actually manifest

896
00:40:49.519 --> 00:40:53.434
as memory of experiences that took place.

897
00:40:53.434 --> 00:40:56.847
This is why this mythology is developed,

898
00:40:56.847 --> 00:40:59.204
that we go to heaven, or we go to hell,

899
00:40:59.204 --> 00:41:00.836
or we go to realms,

900
00:41:00.836 --> 00:41:03.044
they are actual experiences,

901
00:41:03.044 --> 00:41:05.508
very much like in near-death experience

902
00:41:05.508 --> 00:41:08.025
people have the same kind of thing.

903
00:41:08.025 --> 00:41:09.689
Things develop in possibility,

904
00:41:09.689 --> 00:41:12.110
but when we come back to our body

905
00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:15.828
and are revived by the doctor, by the surgeon,

906
00:41:15.828 --> 00:41:19.608
then that one event of manifestation

907
00:41:19.608 --> 00:41:21.757
actually manifests,

908
00:41:21.757 --> 00:41:24.723
events go into an entire causal chain.

909
00:41:24.723 --> 00:41:27.571
And so, there in our memory we remember

910
00:41:27.571 --> 00:41:29.683
that we had encounters with heavenly beings,

911
00:41:29.683 --> 00:41:31.709
encounters with dead relatives,

912
00:41:31.709 --> 00:41:34.088
we had out-of-the-body experiences,

913
00:41:34.088 --> 00:41:36.872
but they are not really experiences

914
00:41:38.822 --> 00:41:42.110
when we were "dead."

915
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:45.808
The experience is actually taking place retroactively,

916
00:41:45.808 --> 00:41:47.355
going backward in time,

917
00:41:47.355 --> 00:41:49.487
when you come to life once more.

918
00:41:49.487 --> 00:41:51.823
So, the same thing happens in the death also,

919
00:41:51.823 --> 00:41:54.468
we are coming to life once more at the next birth

920
00:41:54.468 --> 00:41:57.327
in another body, that's the only difference.

921
00:41:57.327 --> 00:42:00.602
<v Voiceover>Yes, but you have also said</v>

922
00:42:01.472 --> 00:42:03.608
and I may be getting this wrong,

923
00:42:03.608 --> 00:42:05.496
might be splitting hairs here,

924
00:42:05.496 --> 00:42:08.547
that often when we are receiving these insights

925
00:42:08.547 --> 00:42:11.874
or flashes of creativity, intuition and so forth,

926
00:42:11.874 --> 00:42:15.189
that that may also be a non-local

927
00:42:15.189 --> 00:42:17.876
past version of ourselves

928
00:42:17.876 --> 00:42:19.541
communicating with ourselves,

929
00:42:19.541 --> 00:42:22.143
because, again, non-locality is beyond time and space.

930
00:42:22.143 --> 00:42:24.255
So, we may be communicating something

931
00:42:24.255 --> 00:42:26.229
from our past incarnations--

932
00:42:26.229 --> 00:42:28.830
<v ->Yes, very well taken,</v>

933
00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:31.431
so, we can never distinguish

934
00:42:31.431 --> 00:42:33.724
which of our actions

935
00:42:35.114 --> 00:42:38.276
is being caused by in impetus from the past

936
00:42:38.276 --> 00:42:40.687
or impetus from the future.

937
00:42:40.687 --> 00:42:42.478
So this tolls it farther marker agenda

938
00:42:42.478 --> 00:42:45.710
where we analyze our experiences.

939
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:48.793
It's not easy because there is non-linearity

940
00:42:48.793 --> 00:42:51.193
of time that interferes.

941
00:42:51.193 --> 00:42:54.403
<v Voiceover>But if we develop these love circuits,</v>

942
00:42:54.403 --> 00:42:56.941
as you say, I mean it really comes down to this,

943
00:42:56.941 --> 00:42:59.864
if we develop these love circuits

944
00:42:59.864 --> 00:43:02.453
and we start moving into the next area

945
00:43:02.453 --> 00:43:04.883
of the intuitive aspect,

946
00:43:04.883 --> 00:43:06.888
we're going to find our way correctly

947
00:43:06.888 --> 00:43:09.310
regardless of messages coming from the past,

948
00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:11.704
the future, or wherever, aren't we?

949
00:43:11.704 --> 00:43:15.097
<v ->Absolutely, but there is a saying in spiritual traditions,</v>

950
00:43:15.097 --> 00:43:17.518
which is that "After the fact,

951
00:43:17.518 --> 00:43:19.954
"everything that happens is good."

952
00:43:22.194 --> 00:43:23.774
But after the fact,

953
00:43:23.774 --> 00:43:25.437
before the fact we must try,

954
00:43:25.437 --> 00:43:27.005
we must continue trying

955
00:43:27.005 --> 00:43:29.022
not to justify what we are going to do,

956
00:43:29.022 --> 00:43:31.943
but be open and try to do the best we can.

957
00:43:31.943 --> 00:43:34.802
<v Voiceover>If you would give an example,</v>

958
00:43:34.802 --> 00:43:38.504
I think, that's concrete here how we en masse

959
00:43:38.504 --> 00:43:41.713
and individually could have reacted to 9/11,

960
00:43:41.713 --> 00:43:44.157
had we already started moving into our future

961
00:43:44.157 --> 00:43:47.100
evolutionary development into the more intuitive,

962
00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:50.726
the love, the beauty, ethics and goodness.

963
00:43:51.776 --> 00:43:54.383
How would we have responded to that?

964
00:43:54.383 --> 00:43:56.826
<v ->Well, we certainly would not have responded,</v>

965
00:43:56.826 --> 00:44:00.527
certainly caused war in our responses.

966
00:44:01.957 --> 00:44:04.983
Even the war with Al-Qaeda,

967
00:44:04.983 --> 00:44:07.864
which was necessary perhaps,

968
00:44:07.864 --> 00:44:11.010
but certain channels were not even used.

969
00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:13.591
The channels of especially the government of Pakistan

970
00:44:13.591 --> 00:44:16.375
certainly should have been used.

971
00:44:16.375 --> 00:44:18.209
Pakistan should have been involved

972
00:44:18.209 --> 00:44:19.586
at much more intimate level,

973
00:44:19.586 --> 00:44:21.026
and that perhaps opened

974
00:44:21.026 --> 00:44:22.839
a communication channel to the Al-Qaeda.

975
00:44:22.839 --> 00:44:25.697
This principle that people are guided by

976
00:44:25.697 --> 00:44:28.887
as a guiding principle that I don't talk to any terrorists,

977
00:44:28.887 --> 00:44:31.308
this is a principle that sounds good,

978
00:44:31.308 --> 00:44:33.665
but in effect we have always talked to terrorists,

979
00:44:33.665 --> 00:44:35.574
we have always done that.

980
00:44:35.574 --> 00:44:37.729
<v Voiceover>Yes, nothing new here,</v>

981
00:44:37.729 --> 00:44:39.317
we've created a lot of them.

982
00:44:39.317 --> 00:44:42.058
<v ->Who is Stalin but the greatest terrorist</v>

983
00:44:42.058 --> 00:44:44.714
that ever lived on Earth,

984
00:44:44.714 --> 00:44:46.783
20 million people he created,

985
00:44:46.783 --> 00:44:49.183
and we have not only talked to that terrorist,

986
00:44:49.183 --> 00:44:51.092
we have taken his corporation in terms

987
00:44:51.092 --> 00:44:53.879
of fighting war with that terrorist (mumbles)

988
00:44:54.859 --> 00:44:57.424
So, we have done it all the time.

989
00:44:57.424 --> 00:44:59.599
<v Voiceover>This brings up a good point,</v>

990
00:44:59.599 --> 00:45:02.437
are we en masse, you can say because we haven't

991
00:45:02.437 --> 00:45:04.836
fully developed in this direction,

992
00:45:04.836 --> 00:45:06.500
are we being manipulated

993
00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:09.615
by maybe more negative

994
00:45:09.615 --> 00:45:11.507
types of entities,

995
00:45:11.507 --> 00:45:13.822
or are we co-creating this whole thing?

996
00:45:13.822 --> 00:45:16.061
<v ->Co-creation is a word</v>

997
00:45:16.061 --> 00:45:18.397
which should not be used frivolously.

998
00:45:18.397 --> 00:45:20.797
Ultimately we have the responsibility,

999
00:45:20.797 --> 00:45:22.760
because, of course, movement of consciousness

1000
00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.370
is a holistic consciousness

1001
00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:25.650
and one can take the view

1002
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:27.965
that everything is movement of consciousness

1003
00:45:27.965 --> 00:45:30.546
and ultimately that view is correct,

1004
00:45:30.546 --> 00:45:32.274
but immediately speaking,

1005
00:45:32.274 --> 00:45:34.119
the causation can be established,

1006
00:45:34.119 --> 00:45:36.380
things can be because of our creativity,

1007
00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.407
things can be because of our conditioning.

1008
00:45:38.407 --> 00:45:40.721
When our conditioning takes over,

1009
00:45:40.721 --> 00:45:42.897
then basically we have detached ourselves

1010
00:45:42.897 --> 00:45:44.444
from God, from divinity,

1011
00:45:44.444 --> 00:45:45.926
because there is no room

1012
00:45:45.926 --> 00:45:48.486
for downward causation changing anything.

1013
00:45:48.486 --> 00:45:50.715
Of course, that never can completely happen,

1014
00:45:50.715 --> 00:45:52.934
because we never completely can do that,

1015
00:45:52.934 --> 00:45:54.619
so eventually changes come about.

1016
00:45:54.619 --> 00:45:58.362
But when we have such conditioned,

1017
00:46:00.002 --> 00:46:03.311
conditioning take over, such as the tendency

1018
00:46:03.311 --> 00:46:05.753
for negative emotions to dominate us,

1019
00:46:05.753 --> 00:46:07.513
we shouldn't blame God for it,

1020
00:46:07.513 --> 00:46:11.097
because we are doing it sort of being detached from God,

1021
00:46:11.097 --> 00:46:13.571
not the other way round.

1022
00:46:13.571 --> 00:46:17.023
Nor should we take collective blame

1023
00:46:17.023 --> 00:46:20.556
in a cavalier way.

1024
00:46:20.556 --> 00:46:23.233
I think that would be too much,

1025
00:46:23.233 --> 00:46:24.652
that's not necessary.

1026
00:46:24.652 --> 00:46:26.199
Instead, let's just recognize

1027
00:46:26.199 --> 00:46:29.004
that because of these conditionings

1028
00:46:29.004 --> 00:46:31.679
sometimes drastic, evil

1029
00:46:31.679 --> 00:46:34.237
comes about in the world

1030
00:46:34.237 --> 00:46:36.840
and without our being aware,

1031
00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:38.856
a large number of people surrender

1032
00:46:38.856 --> 00:46:42.514
to the will of this evil charismatic leaders

1033
00:46:42.514 --> 00:46:45.171
and that caused atrocities.

1034
00:46:45.171 --> 00:46:47.911
That has happened over and over, many times.

1035
00:46:47.911 --> 00:46:51.058
The atrocities happen in the mental age

1036
00:46:51.058 --> 00:46:54.823
of evolution especially because one can use

1037
00:46:54.823 --> 00:46:57.768
the rational mind to give justifications

1038
00:46:57.768 --> 00:47:00.369
for even atrocious actions.

1039
00:47:00.369 --> 00:47:02.077
Witness the justifications of Iraqi word

1040
00:47:02.077 --> 00:47:04.455
that has been given so much,

1041
00:47:04.455 --> 00:47:06.406
and still being given.

1042
00:47:06.406 --> 00:47:08.678
Witness the justification for global warming

1043
00:47:08.678 --> 00:47:11.195
that is being given and so much

1044
00:47:11.195 --> 00:47:13.292
by the businesses, industries

1045
00:47:13.292 --> 00:47:15.628
that need to pollute.

1046
00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:20.587
This is the perverted use of rationality.

1047
00:47:22.112 --> 00:47:26.171
But we can't use rationality in a rational way,

1048
00:47:26.171 --> 00:47:30.091
because we are tired by these negative emotions.

1049
00:47:30.091 --> 00:47:34.421
In the first case because of this charisma or egotism,

1050
00:47:34.421 --> 00:47:36.864
megalomania, whatever you want to call it.

1051
00:47:36.864 --> 00:47:40.298
In the second case because of the greed of the industry.

1052
00:47:40.298 --> 00:47:43.486
These are all negative emotions.

1053
00:47:43.486 --> 00:47:46.122
Negative emotions cloud our judgement.

1054
00:47:46.122 --> 00:47:48.849
Until we have collectively

1055
00:47:48.849 --> 00:47:50.844
balanced these negative emotions

1056
00:47:50.844 --> 00:47:52.828
with positive energies of love,

1057
00:47:52.828 --> 00:47:55.163
we cannot be fully rational.

1058
00:47:55.163 --> 00:47:57.137
And only when we are fully rational en masse

1059
00:47:57.137 --> 00:48:00.955
then only we can move to the next stage of evolution,

1060
00:48:00.955 --> 00:48:02.974
which is the intuitive mind.

1061
00:48:02.974 --> 00:48:04.537
<v Voiceover>And you're working on this,</v>

1062
00:48:04.537 --> 00:48:06.425
you're doing your part,

1063
00:48:06.425 --> 00:48:08.516
you're arranging some interesting things

1064
00:48:08.516 --> 00:48:10.820
that are going to be forth coming

1065
00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:12.953
in another few to several months,

1066
00:48:12.953 --> 00:48:15.513
part of it's called Quantum Activism.

1067
00:48:15.513 --> 00:48:17.337
Can you talk about what your general,

1068
00:48:17.337 --> 00:48:19.982
I know the particulars may not be worked out this moment,

1069
00:48:19.982 --> 00:48:21.730
but what is the general concept?--

1070
00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:24.494
<v ->The general concept of Quantum Activism is very simple.</v>

1071
00:48:24.494 --> 00:48:27.352
Quantum physics has give us some wonderful principles:

1072
00:48:27.352 --> 00:48:30.744
non-locality, working together, collectively,

1073
00:48:30.744 --> 00:48:34.040
developing that interconnectedness, discontinuity.

1074
00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.247
Recognize that discontinuous changes

1075
00:48:36.247 --> 00:48:38.263
take place all the time in our lives.

1076
00:48:38.263 --> 00:48:41.335
We have done it quite often in our childhood.

1077
00:48:41.335 --> 00:48:42.775
And why not do it again?--

1078
00:48:42.775 --> 00:48:45.602
<v Voiceover>Any leaps of development with no connecting--</v>

1079
00:48:45.602 --> 00:48:48.933
<v ->Quantum leaps of development in our own life.</v>

1080
00:48:48.933 --> 00:48:51.834
So, take charge of those things.

1081
00:48:51.834 --> 00:48:54.416
And it is hard one, is tangled hierarchy,

1082
00:48:54.416 --> 00:48:56.314
instead of simple hierarchy,

1083
00:48:56.314 --> 00:48:57.760
we still continue

1084
00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.853
in spite of sexism, racism,

1085
00:49:00.853 --> 00:49:04.244
all these things coming to forefront or our consciousness

1086
00:49:04.244 --> 00:49:07.882
and somewhat resolved today in favor of more unification.

1087
00:49:07.882 --> 00:49:11.583
We still have the tendency of developing hierarchies

1088
00:49:11.583 --> 00:49:14.217
where we want to dominate another person.

1089
00:49:14.217 --> 00:49:15.849
Instead, if we learned to live

1090
00:49:15.849 --> 00:49:18.344
in tangled hierarchical relationship,

1091
00:49:18.344 --> 00:49:22.116
the causal hierarchy will always be as necessary.

1092
00:49:23.566 --> 00:49:27.704
So, there would be not many fixed causal relationships,

1093
00:49:27.704 --> 00:49:29.634
one-way causal relationships,

1094
00:49:29.634 --> 00:49:31.906
but all of our causal relationships

1095
00:49:31.906 --> 00:49:33.538
will become two-way.

1096
00:49:33.538 --> 00:49:37.399
If we used this quantum principle in our life,

1097
00:49:37.399 --> 00:49:40.237
then our personal life will be transformed.

1098
00:49:40.237 --> 00:49:42.124
But we must also simultaneously

1099
00:49:42.124 --> 00:49:44.727
learn to use them collectively.

1100
00:49:44.727 --> 00:49:47.823
We have not done this collective aspect

1101
00:49:47.823 --> 00:49:51.665
of using principle transformation very much in the past.

1102
00:49:51.665 --> 00:49:54.966
This is the new thing that has to happen.

1103
00:49:54.966 --> 00:49:56.331
<v Voiceover>And this is something</v>

1104
00:49:56.331 --> 00:49:58.099
you are going to participate in bringing about?

1105
00:49:58.099 --> 00:50:00.937
<v ->This is something that I feel,</v>

1106
00:50:00.937 --> 00:50:03.454
because of my grounding in quantum principles,

1107
00:50:03.454 --> 00:50:06.961
I feel that is very essential to bring in

1108
00:50:06.961 --> 00:50:09.140
the next step of our evolution,

1109
00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:10.863
the intuitive mind.

1110
00:50:10.863 --> 00:50:12.740
<v Voiceover>Well, we will be awaiting that</v>

1111
00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:14.095
and everybody watching this

1112
00:50:14.095 --> 00:50:16.207
will be following your site as it comes along

1113
00:50:16.207 --> 00:50:18.265
and participating where we can,

1114
00:50:18.265 --> 00:50:19.696
I'm very sure.

1115
00:50:19.696 --> 00:50:20.774
Thank you so much

1116
00:50:20.774 --> 00:50:23.501
for taking the time to be with us.

1117
00:50:27.091 --> 00:50:29.566
<v ->For a greater understanding of Dr. Goswami's work</v>

1118
00:50:29.566 --> 00:50:31.582
regarding the integration of physics

1119
00:50:31.582 --> 00:50:33.960
and the journey of the soul via reincarnation,

1120
00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:35.965
I highly recommend you read his book,

1121
00:50:35.965 --> 00:50:37.269
Physics of the Soul.

1122
00:50:37.269 --> 00:50:38.518
Until next time,

1123
00:50:38.518 --> 00:50:40.862
thanks for watching CMN.
