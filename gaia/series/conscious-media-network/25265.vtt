00:00:05.199 --> 00:00:10.199
(slow music)

2
00:00:11.748 --> 00:00:13.486
<v ->Had you ever wondered about beginners luck,</v>

3
00:00:13.486 --> 00:00:15.481
why its so easy the first time

4
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.415
but gets progressively worse as we try to

5
00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:18.577
repeat the task.

6
00:00:18.577 --> 00:00:20.529
Professor Jonathan Schooler had become

7
00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.385
a bit of a rockstar in the world of science

8
00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:24.966
in his work concerning language and memory,

9
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.886
when he discovered something disturbing,

10
00:00:26.886 --> 00:00:29.606
something he calls the Decline Affect,

11
00:00:29.606 --> 00:00:31.857
or what we might casually call the phenomena

12
00:00:31.857 --> 00:00:33.275
of beginners luck.

13
00:00:33.275 --> 00:00:36.309
We spoke about it at the IONS conference in San Francisco.

14
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.093
Jonathan this is a little bit complex to talk about,

15
00:00:41.093 --> 00:00:44.464
you're a scientist and you have been studying

16
00:00:44.464 --> 00:00:46.096
this phenomena for a while.

17
00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:48.997
I assume because its dogging you,

18
00:00:48.997 --> 00:00:51.962
its been dogging you, the thing called the Decline Affect.

19
00:00:51.962 --> 00:00:54.245
So could you give us a little bit of background,

20
00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:57.370
prior to launching into the studies that the Decline Affect,

21
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.506
were you were noticing and why it was frustrating you?

22
00:01:00.506 --> 00:01:03.897
<v ->Sure, Well, as a graduate student,</v>

23
00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.478
I discovered a phenomenon that I was really excited about.

24
00:01:06.478 --> 00:01:08.196
Its a very simple phenomenon really.

25
00:01:08.196 --> 00:01:12.697
We had individuals view videotape of a bank robbery

26
00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:14.627
and then some people described it

27
00:01:14.627 --> 00:01:16.131
in as much detail as possible

28
00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:18.339
and others engaged in some unrelated tasks,

29
00:01:18.339 --> 00:01:21.571
such as naming states and then we gave them a lineup

30
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:23.075
and the simple question was,

31
00:01:23.075 --> 00:01:25.539
"Whats the effect of describing the appearance,

32
00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.237
"of a previously seen face on people's ability

33
00:01:28.237 --> 00:01:29.090
"to recognise it",

34
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.712
and you might think that this would be helpful,

35
00:01:30.712 --> 00:01:34.509
its after all verbal rehearsal but interestingly

36
00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.133
we found that describing a face actually interfered

37
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:39.874
with people's later ability to recognise it

38
00:01:39.874 --> 00:01:42.285
and this basic effect I was able to replicate

39
00:01:42.285 --> 00:01:45.047
a number of times and this was my dissertation

40
00:01:45.047 --> 00:01:46.818
and I got published in a good journal

41
00:01:46.818 --> 00:01:47.906
and I was really excited.

42
00:01:47.906 --> 00:01:50.348
I thought this is just going to be a cake walk,

43
00:01:50.348 --> 00:01:51.553
lets do this again and agian,

44
00:01:51.553 --> 00:01:54.807
all sorts of different ways and I was able to get the effect

45
00:01:54.807 --> 00:01:56.822
subsequently but never to the same degree

46
00:01:56.822 --> 00:01:58.913
and in fact the more times I tried to get it

47
00:01:58.913 --> 00:02:01.438
the smaller the affect was and so here it was

48
00:02:01.438 --> 00:02:03.868
this really exciting affect and I just sort of watched it

49
00:02:03.868 --> 00:02:06.545
gradually shrink down.

50
00:02:06.545 --> 00:02:10.395
<v Voiceover>Yeah and so that brought about</v>

51
00:02:10.395 --> 00:02:12.411
another question that you had to,

52
00:02:12.411 --> 00:02:14.555
I guess you couldn't be satisfied with

53
00:02:14.555 --> 00:02:16.987
continuing then until you answered the next question

54
00:02:16.987 --> 00:02:18.405
and you've been trying to answer that question

55
00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:19.664
for how long now?

56
00:02:19.664 --> 00:02:24.112
<v ->Well I actually, after that I like first just sort of</v>

57
00:02:24.112 --> 00:02:25.488
ignored it a little bit and I thought

58
00:02:25.488 --> 00:02:26.927
well I will just try other areas

59
00:02:26.927 --> 00:02:29.850
and so I tried it in colour and I tried it

60
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.877
with taste, all sorts of different things were

61
00:02:31.877 --> 00:02:34.287
people describe it and then look at the effect

62
00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:37.210
of describing versus not and in each one of these cases

63
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.065
when I first tried a new domain it would work

64
00:02:39.065 --> 00:02:41.135
great and then that would go away

65
00:02:41.135 --> 00:02:43.481
and it was on of these hard things to really sort of

66
00:02:43.481 --> 00:02:45.198
come to terms with the fact that somehow

67
00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:47.385
everything I was trying was working

68
00:02:47.385 --> 00:02:51.171
and then and then not working but eventually

69
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:54.094
I started becoming interested in that fact.

70
00:02:54.094 --> 00:02:56.526
In the fact that there was something weird going on here

71
00:02:56.526 --> 00:02:59.971
with the effects that I were getting were going down.

72
00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:01.059
<v Voiceover>And its very predictable</v>

73
00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:02.403
when you showed your graphs yesterday,

74
00:03:02.403 --> 00:03:04.589
this is pretty much a constant throughout

75
00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:06.904
all of these different studies you were running.

76
00:03:06.904 --> 00:03:09.762
<v ->Thats right. I saw the same sort of pattern</v>

77
00:03:09.762 --> 00:03:11.597
in a number of different studies

78
00:03:11.597 --> 00:03:14.018
and then I started looking into

79
00:03:14.018 --> 00:03:16.823
really different areas and at the same time that I

80
00:03:16.823 --> 00:03:19.426
did that I found out that some of these areas

81
00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:24.183
also had observed this same Decline Affect that a dog made.

82
00:03:24.183 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Voiceover>And this is interesting.</v>

83
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.873
We're going to some really practical, recognisable

84
00:03:27.873 --> 00:03:30.262
areas that this also applies to

85
00:03:30.262 --> 00:03:32.406
and I think for most people watching this

86
00:03:32.406 --> 00:03:34.977
and certainly for myself, the whole thing about

87
00:03:34.977 --> 00:03:38.784
beginner's luck and I, I mean I know what

88
00:03:38.784 --> 00:03:40.619
my own perceptions are about it.

89
00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:42.507
Just kind of watching what happened to

90
00:03:42.507 --> 00:03:45.525
my body, my emotions and my mind

91
00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:47.893
during this process of decline

92
00:03:47.893 --> 00:03:50.677
and that would have to do with most things.

93
00:03:50.677 --> 00:03:52.714
I mean certainly most sports for example,

94
00:03:52.714 --> 00:03:56.597
dancing, I could always do things pretty well

95
00:03:56.597 --> 00:03:59.263
right off the bat, sometimes really really well,

96
00:03:59.263 --> 00:04:03.519
the first time out and so you have sort of an

97
00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.327
attitude toward that or a concept of

98
00:04:07.327 --> 00:04:10.665
what your abilities are based on that

99
00:04:10.665 --> 00:04:13.310
and then you try it again and it doesn't go

100
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.934
quite as well and then I noticed a cascade

101
00:04:15.934 --> 00:04:19.123
of affects going on through my body, my mind

102
00:04:19.123 --> 00:04:21.630
and my emotions which now we are talking consciousness.

103
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.451
Right? So lets talk about that area of,

104
00:04:26.451 --> 00:04:27.613
what are some of the,

105
00:04:27.613 --> 00:04:31.421
as you have studied, what have you ruled out

106
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:34.610
and what is still very much open to question

107
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.815
<v ->Well.</v>

108
00:04:35.815 --> 00:04:37.511
<v Voiceover>Cause this is a science and consciousness</v>

109
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:38.461
type of conference.

110
00:04:38.461 --> 00:04:40.572
<v ->Sure. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I wish I could say</v>

111
00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:45.308
that I ruled out more, I think that although researchers

112
00:04:45.308 --> 00:04:48.881
have observed of the Decline Affect, in across a number

113
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:51.249
of different domains, there really hasn't been

114
00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:53.873
a targeted effort to try to understand and

115
00:04:53.873 --> 00:04:56.689
in particularly across domains and so really

116
00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:59.611
what we have much more of is a whole variety

117
00:04:59.611 --> 00:05:01.211
of different things that it could be

118
00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:04.678
and much less of specifically it can't be this,

119
00:05:04.678 --> 00:05:06.651
or it can't be that, so unfortunately,

120
00:05:06.651 --> 00:05:10.992
we just don't know what can be ruled out.

121
00:05:10.992 --> 00:05:12.773
Theres only one thing that I think can be ruled out

122
00:05:12.773 --> 00:05:14.170
and thats ignoring it

123
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.120
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

124
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.656
<v ->I think that thats the one thing that</v>

125
00:05:16.656 --> 00:05:19.045
has been happening where people just sort of pretend

126
00:05:19.045 --> 00:05:22.085
its not there and I think that can be ruled out

127
00:05:22.085 --> 00:05:25.572
but less than that, I think we have to really

128
00:05:25.572 --> 00:05:26.874
just face up to the fact that theres this

129
00:05:26.874 --> 00:05:28.649
really peculiar phenomenon going on,

130
00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:31.199
where affect sizes seem to get smaller

131
00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.756
when you replicate the studies.

132
00:05:32.756 --> 00:05:33.705
<v Voiceover>And didn't you do</v>

133
00:05:33.705 --> 00:05:36.894
a conventional look at it, in terms of

134
00:05:36.894 --> 00:05:38.881
knocking out some of the obvious testing factors

135
00:05:38.881 --> 00:05:39.809
and so forth

136
00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:40.342
<v ->Sure</v>

137
00:05:40.342 --> 00:05:41.551
<v Voiceover>So you are finding that by and large</v>

138
00:05:41.551 --> 00:05:43.161
those didn't seem to be what was

139
00:05:43.161 --> 00:05:44.569
<v ->Well I wouldn't say that.</v>

140
00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.268
What i would say is that no single one of those

141
00:05:47.268 --> 00:05:52.268
explanations alone is sufficient to explain this.

142
00:05:52.494 --> 00:05:55.512
So I'm not ready yet to necessarily state that

143
00:05:55.512 --> 00:05:57.507
it requires an unconventional account,

144
00:05:57.507 --> 00:05:59.341
but what I can say is that theres no

145
00:05:59.341 --> 00:06:03.523
single explanation, no single conventional explanation

146
00:06:03.523 --> 00:06:06.168
that seems to be sufficient to explain it

147
00:06:06.168 --> 00:06:07.864
and I can tell you about some of those.

148
00:06:07.864 --> 00:06:11.276
<v Voiceover>Okay, lets talk about some of the</v>

149
00:06:11.276 --> 00:06:13.453
because of the nature of the audience

150
00:06:13.453 --> 00:06:14.199
<v ->Sure</v>

151
00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.938
<v Voiceover>some of the potential subtle affects</v>

152
00:06:15.938 --> 00:06:19.116
like say for me, what I was just handling there.

153
00:06:19.116 --> 00:06:19.863
<v ->Sure</v>

154
00:06:19.863 --> 00:06:21.996
<v Voiceover>So first of all theres attachment to outcome,</v>

155
00:06:21.996 --> 00:06:24.300
then you don't get your attachment to outcome

156
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.038
and there can come frustration,

157
00:06:26.038 --> 00:06:29.110
there can even come fear of failure at some point.

158
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.702
Obvious things start happening which,

159
00:06:31.702 --> 00:06:35.115
looking at the experiments we were doing yesterday

160
00:06:35.115 --> 00:06:37.206
and some of Dean Raiden's also

161
00:06:37.206 --> 00:06:37.952
<v ->Sure</v>

162
00:06:37.952 --> 00:06:39.627
<v Voiceover>has to be affecting this,</v>

163
00:06:39.627 --> 00:06:41.760
I mean you would think it has to be

164
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.309
these feelings and the morphogenic field,

165
00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:45.291
whatever you want to call it,

166
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:46.613
I think you had dinner with Rupert.

167
00:06:46.613 --> 00:06:47.221
<v ->I did, yeah.</v>

168
00:06:47.221 --> 00:06:49.296
<v Voiceover>And chatted with him yesterday,</v>

169
00:06:49.296 --> 00:06:51.146
I was wondering, I would love to been a fly on the wall

170
00:06:51.146 --> 00:06:54.261
and see how this was all weaving together between all of you

171
00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:58.719
but how just going in that wild realm would you perceive it

172
00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:00.596
having been involved with this for so long.

173
00:07:00.596 --> 00:07:04.105
<v ->Sure, so and again I,</v>

174
00:07:04.105 --> 00:07:06.217
I come from a perspective where I

175
00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:10.508
am not quite as able to just jump on the band wagon

176
00:07:10.508 --> 00:07:12.791
and necessarily embrace these perspectives

177
00:07:12.791 --> 00:07:14.945
and I have to sort of throw that caveat out there

178
00:07:14.945 --> 00:07:15.852
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

179
00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:17.132
<v ->But when I put that hat on</v>

180
00:07:17.132 --> 00:07:19.563
and I sort of go with my gut about

181
00:07:19.563 --> 00:07:21.313
what it feels like is going on,

182
00:07:21.313 --> 00:07:23.979
are there two sort of general kinds of things,

183
00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:25.697
that seem like they may be going on here.

184
00:07:25.697 --> 00:07:30.176
One is that when you first do a study,

185
00:07:30.176 --> 00:07:32.344
you are so excited about the idea that

186
00:07:32.344 --> 00:07:33.881
theres sort of a, everything is open and it just

187
00:07:33.881 --> 00:07:36.345
really feels promising and you do it

188
00:07:36.345 --> 00:07:38.852
and it works exactly the way you had hoped

189
00:07:38.852 --> 00:07:41.337
and so theres just sort of a fulfilment of that expectation

190
00:07:41.337 --> 00:07:43.278
and then you do it a few more times,

191
00:07:43.278 --> 00:07:44.889
you get a little bit more complacent,

192
00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:46.808
you start to sort of take it for granted

193
00:07:46.808 --> 00:07:49.454
and something about that sort of,

194
00:07:49.454 --> 00:07:51.384
now taking it for granted, you sort of

195
00:07:51.384 --> 00:07:54.616
habituated to it, its not quite as exciting as it was before

196
00:07:54.616 --> 00:07:58.861
and perhaps this, the enthusiasm that the experimenter

197
00:07:58.861 --> 00:08:02.274
is having is somehow translating into the

198
00:08:02.274 --> 00:08:05.058
way in which the affect is actually manifesting itself,

199
00:08:05.058 --> 00:08:08.332
that there is some sort of para-psychological manner,

200
00:08:08.332 --> 00:08:11.767
in which the experimenter is influencing the outcome.

201
00:08:11.767 --> 00:08:14.113
It certainly feels that way.

202
00:08:14.113 --> 00:08:15.927
<v Voiceover>That would make sense from</v>

203
00:08:15.927 --> 00:08:17.996
your point of view, its repetition of anything.

204
00:08:17.996 --> 00:08:20.385
<v ->Thats right, its like, I coined the term</v>

205
00:08:20.385 --> 00:08:22.827
cosmic habituation, somehow when you're just

206
00:08:22.827 --> 00:08:25.056
do it again the universe and you sort of

207
00:08:25.056 --> 00:08:27.371
can jointly get bored.

208
00:08:27.371 --> 00:08:29.440
When I talked to Rupert Cheldrik about this,

209
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.278
he also suggested that what was happening is

210
00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:34.709
you put the idea out there and other people go,

211
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:37.099
"Hmmm that doesn't sound right"

212
00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:40.074
and so theres a skepticism among others

213
00:08:40.074 --> 00:08:43.328
and it maybe that somehow the skepticism

214
00:08:43.328 --> 00:08:46.506
among others perhaps even influencing you as well,

215
00:08:46.506 --> 00:08:50.388
has this sort of affect of dampening the power,

216
00:08:50.388 --> 00:08:53.151
the fact, so he was suggesting, to actually do a study

217
00:08:53.151 --> 00:08:58.151
where you increase the skepticism about a phenomenon

218
00:08:58.348 --> 00:09:00.913
and then examine whether that facilitates

219
00:09:00.913 --> 00:09:03.451
or speeds up the Decline Affect.

220
00:09:03.451 --> 00:09:05.883
<v Voiceover>Yeah that would certainly make sense.</v>

221
00:09:05.883 --> 00:09:08.582
When you were talking a moment ago

222
00:09:08.582 --> 00:09:12.688
about this cosmic habituation or cosmic boredom,

223
00:09:12.688 --> 00:09:15.888
I'm looking at that now and it brings up bubbles,

224
00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:17.497
all kinds of questions bubble up

225
00:09:17.497 --> 00:09:19.749
because this has a very practical implication

226
00:09:19.749 --> 00:09:21.370
in our lives across the board.

227
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:26.370
With our, many of us have the inability

228
00:09:26.437 --> 00:09:31.437
to sustain a really energised interest in anything

229
00:09:31.844 --> 00:09:35.609
for a long period of time and maybe that even

230
00:09:35.609 --> 00:09:39.086
goes against the grain of the cosmic functioning.

231
00:09:39.086 --> 00:09:42.244
Is there something about new and impulsive

232
00:09:42.244 --> 00:09:46.777
and refreshing that is native to life perhaps?

233
00:09:46.777 --> 00:09:48.078
Thats in this equation.

234
00:09:48.078 --> 00:09:50.627
<v ->Well, I thinks thats the kind of thing that</v>

235
00:09:50.627 --> 00:09:53.742
I find myself, at least on some days,

236
00:09:53.742 --> 00:09:58.178
leaning towards, I think there maybe someway in which

237
00:09:58.178 --> 00:10:02.210
beginners luck is somehow just in the fabric of

238
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:06.950
the cosmos, that if we set off in some sort of promising

239
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.830
direction, that when we first try something new

240
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.315
and its promising, somehow the universe affords

241
00:10:12.315 --> 00:10:16.422
opportunities that may not be there subsequently

242
00:10:16.422 --> 00:10:20.123
and I have to say I found myself,

243
00:10:20.123 --> 00:10:24.560
my decisions influenced under these circumstances.

244
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.490
So, for example, lot of times if you

245
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.573
see an opportunity, you move to a new town

246
00:10:29.573 --> 00:10:32.485
and you see a house and you, it just seems spectacular

247
00:10:32.485 --> 00:10:34.778
you think "Oh, this would be too impulsive

248
00:10:34.778 --> 00:10:37.007
"to buy this right away, surely there will be lots of other,

249
00:10:37.007 --> 00:10:39.055
"you know just as good"

250
00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:42.212
and I have to tell you, the last house I bought,

251
00:10:42.212 --> 00:10:45.604
I looked at a few houses but it was like the third house

252
00:10:45.604 --> 00:10:47.801
and I was like "No, I don't believe that,

253
00:10:47.801 --> 00:10:50.308
"I don't believe that its just gonna be, you know

254
00:10:50.308 --> 00:10:52.910
"one of many many others that I'll see"

255
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:56.089
It felt like this was another one of these examples

256
00:10:56.089 --> 00:10:58.062
of the first time, beginners luck and I was,

257
00:10:58.062 --> 00:11:00.227
I bought the house, you know

258
00:11:00.227 --> 00:11:01.646
and I was influenced by

259
00:11:01.646 --> 00:11:02.595
<v Voiceover>You didn't do a study?</v>

260
00:11:02.595 --> 00:11:04.920
<v ->I didn't do a study and it was a big decision</v>

261
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.149
and admittedly the market went down

262
00:11:07.149 --> 00:11:09.005
but this still was the most spectacular house

263
00:11:09.005 --> 00:11:13.389
and I have never once regretted that decision

264
00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:16.343
and I think that being aware of that fact,

265
00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:18.007
being aware that these are the possibility

266
00:11:18.007 --> 00:11:20.098
that when you first encounter a new situation,

267
00:11:20.098 --> 00:11:22.941
there maybe opportunities there that you just can't

268
00:11:22.941 --> 00:11:25.533
count on repeating themselves and that may just be

269
00:11:25.533 --> 00:11:28.744
sort of the way life is, that somebody keep in mind

270
00:11:28.744 --> 00:11:31.250
and its certainly consistent with this research.

271
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.269
<v Voiceover>We absolutely and that to me where it</v>

272
00:11:34.269 --> 00:11:35.868
gets really juicy because we all know,

273
00:11:35.868 --> 00:11:38.194
we've all felt it and its almost as though

274
00:11:38.194 --> 00:11:41.767
theres an imperative on a cosmic scale

275
00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:44.903
that we continue to move forward,

276
00:11:44.903 --> 00:11:47.804
grow, be open to change, whatever you want to call it,

277
00:11:47.804 --> 00:11:50.268
it seems thats a nature of life.

278
00:11:50.268 --> 00:11:53.777
<v ->Yeah, theres something about first experiences</v>

279
00:11:53.777 --> 00:11:58.256
that seem fundamentally profound that we should be looking

280
00:11:58.256 --> 00:12:01.413
for these first experiences in different situations

281
00:12:01.413 --> 00:12:05.168
and we need to really appreciate the oppurtunities

282
00:12:05.168 --> 00:12:07.866
that those first experiences may provide

283
00:12:07.866 --> 00:12:10.554
and recognise that these maybe really unique.

284
00:12:10.554 --> 00:12:13.370
<v Voiceover>And yet at the same time,</v>

285
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:16.453
you know, part of me is hearing you saying,

286
00:12:16.453 --> 00:12:19.130
yeah but then aren't we just kind of adrenaline junkies,

287
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.330
this is very different then being an adrenaline junkie

288
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:26.041
and this, the distinction should be made at this point,

289
00:12:26.041 --> 00:12:28.782
just looking for new input, new everything,

290
00:12:28.782 --> 00:12:33.518
consuming, using and exploiting for the sake of getting

291
00:12:33.518 --> 00:12:36.355
a rush, an adrenaline rush, an ego rush,

292
00:12:36.355 --> 00:12:38.446
thats not what we are talking about here.

293
00:12:38.446 --> 00:12:41.784
<v ->Well, I mean, the key thing here is that</v>

294
00:12:41.784 --> 00:12:44.621
when one finds oneself in these circumstances,

295
00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:49.357
that you can expect certain kinds of oppurtunities

296
00:12:49.357 --> 00:12:52.952
potentially present themselves but that doesn't mean

297
00:12:52.952 --> 00:12:55.746
that one wants to just go willy nilly,

298
00:12:55.746 --> 00:12:58.594
that there has to be constraints on the kinds of

299
00:12:58.594 --> 00:13:00.386
new experience ones going to look for

300
00:13:00.386 --> 00:13:02.892
and one might well also expect if one

301
00:13:02.892 --> 00:13:05.868
goes in sort of dangerous directions that there could be

302
00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:10.868
really disturbing, you know, you could have things going

303
00:13:12.108 --> 00:13:15.521
extra bad and that will sort of set you,

304
00:13:15.521 --> 00:13:17.867
I've had probably some of those experience too,

305
00:13:17.867 --> 00:13:19.894
I've done something a little marginal

306
00:13:19.894 --> 00:13:21.931
and it well really really bad and

307
00:13:21.931 --> 00:13:24.576
I was like, "Oh, Okay, I get it"

308
00:13:24.576 --> 00:13:27.019
Thats right, so it kind of straightens you out both ways.

309
00:13:27.019 --> 00:13:32.019
When I take this sort of spiritual perspective

310
00:13:34.261 --> 00:13:36.842
on these kinds of phenomenon and imagine

311
00:13:36.842 --> 00:13:38.762
what they might mean and again I have to

312
00:13:38.762 --> 00:13:40.949
put on my scientific hat for a second and still say

313
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:44.543
only some of the time am I able to do that.

314
00:13:44.543 --> 00:13:47.519
But when I do that it feels like when one is going in a

315
00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:50.356
good direction and they try something new

316
00:13:50.356 --> 00:13:53.161
that the universe really opens up

317
00:13:53.161 --> 00:13:56.478
but if you go in a dangerous direction

318
00:13:56.478 --> 00:13:58.132
its going to be exactly the opposite.

319
00:13:58.132 --> 00:14:01.150
It seems as if its in directions that are

320
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:05.160
sort of promising so there does seem to be something

321
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.974
to this verbal over shadowing affect,

322
00:14:06.974 --> 00:14:10.088
its just nowhere near as big as when I first discovered it.

323
00:14:10.088 --> 00:14:12.776
The universe was like, "Yeah, go in this direction"

324
00:14:12.776 --> 00:14:15.240
but just recognise that its not going to be

325
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.170
this easy all the way through.

326
00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:21.159
The alchemist, the beautiful allegorical tale

327
00:14:21.159 --> 00:14:23.346
has this as one of its central themes,

328
00:14:23.346 --> 00:14:28.220
where the boy goes in an important direction

329
00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:32.028
and at first gets some really really positive oppurtunities

330
00:14:32.028 --> 00:14:35.441
and sort of says "Yes" you know "Go after it, do this"

331
00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:38.481
but then runs into lot of difficulties so it somehow,

332
00:14:38.481 --> 00:14:40.828
when you're going in a good direction,

333
00:14:40.828 --> 00:14:43.334
you get sort of this opening up intitally

334
00:14:43.334 --> 00:14:46.544
but you can't count on it carrying on that way

335
00:14:46.544 --> 00:14:50.235
and in fact what that means is that

336
00:14:50.235 --> 00:14:52.229
you probably want to continue going in that way

337
00:14:52.229 --> 00:14:54.602
and not necessarily just try another way and

338
00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:56.341
another way and another way and I think theres,

339
00:14:56.341 --> 00:14:59.967
if one pursues this sort of perspective

340
00:14:59.967 --> 00:15:03.711
that this might suggest, it says that when you get something

341
00:15:03.711 --> 00:15:06.559
that opens up in a promising way, that tells you

342
00:15:06.559 --> 00:15:09.460
its a good direction to go in but don't count on it

343
00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.159
being as easy from there on in.

344
00:15:12.159 --> 00:15:15.156
<v Voiceover>Yes its almost as though its a, an invitation</v>

345
00:15:15.156 --> 00:15:15.988
<v ->Yes.</v>

346
00:15:15.988 --> 00:15:18.153
<v Voiceover>Theres a little voice, theres your invite,</v>

347
00:15:18.153 --> 00:15:20.073
just like when you bought your house,

348
00:15:20.073 --> 00:15:22.355
thats your, you loved that house and thats how I buy

349
00:15:22.355 --> 00:15:25.160
all my life I bought houses like that and it will

350
00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.667
seem crazy, people say, "Aren't you going to look around

351
00:15:27.667 --> 00:15:28.499
"a little more",

352
00:15:28.499 --> 00:15:29.992
but something in me will just say,

353
00:15:29.992 --> 00:15:31.549
you know, I heard about this place,

354
00:15:31.549 --> 00:15:34.792
I just have to take a peek and I have a physiological

355
00:15:34.792 --> 00:15:38.205
response to that, every time its very cosistent

356
00:15:38.205 --> 00:15:40.178
and I've never gone wrong.

357
00:15:40.178 --> 00:15:42.912
I've always loved the places that I have either bought

358
00:15:42.912 --> 00:15:45.355
or in times passed, rented even.

359
00:15:45.355 --> 00:15:47.136
That first impulse, but you are right.

360
00:15:47.136 --> 00:15:49.258
Just because you go in there doesn't mean

361
00:15:49.258 --> 00:15:50.442
things aren't going to breakdown,

362
00:15:50.442 --> 00:15:51.925
you are not going to have to make repairs

363
00:15:51.925 --> 00:15:53.066
<v ->Right, Right.</v>

364
00:15:53.066 --> 00:15:54.314
<v Voiceover>But you're in the right place,</v>

365
00:15:54.314 --> 00:15:55.594
you're on the right road, the right path.

366
00:15:55.594 --> 00:15:59.007
Lets extend this Decline Affect out to a couple of other

367
00:15:59.007 --> 00:16:01.631
areas that I thought were interesting

368
00:16:01.631 --> 00:16:05.716
because, in my mind I was perceiving it in a certain way

369
00:16:05.716 --> 00:16:08.383
but I want to know how you're perceiving it

370
00:16:08.383 --> 00:16:12.905
and that is, when we are looking at drug treatments even.

371
00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:16.478
Studies have been done where certain drugs,

372
00:16:16.478 --> 00:16:18.921
and these are classes of drugs that are pretty common.

373
00:16:18.921 --> 00:16:21.587
We have cholesterol, beta blocker, glaucoma

374
00:16:21.587 --> 00:16:23.336
and even anti psychotic drugs,

375
00:16:23.336 --> 00:16:28.336
we don't need to name brands but in each of these cases

376
00:16:28.445 --> 00:16:31.602
this Decline affect has also taken place,

377
00:16:31.602 --> 00:16:33.832
even on a physiological level.

378
00:16:33.832 --> 00:16:35.752
Whats up with that?

379
00:16:35.752 --> 00:16:40.509
<v ->Well again its important not to dismiss</v>

380
00:16:40.509 --> 00:16:44.274
the more conventional kinds of explanations

381
00:16:44.274 --> 00:16:46.801
so I can't emphasise enough that well,

382
00:16:46.801 --> 00:16:48.753
I personally am open to an idea that

383
00:16:48.753 --> 00:16:53.702
there really is some sort of energy thing going on here

384
00:16:53.702 --> 00:16:56.049
and certain affordances that the universe provides,

385
00:16:56.049 --> 00:16:59.014
that there maybe also some very basic kinds of

386
00:16:59.014 --> 00:17:01.809
conventional things so one possibility is that

387
00:17:01.809 --> 00:17:06.809
when researchers first do studies they just get lucky,

388
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.856
they just you know, you don't bring a drug to market unless

389
00:17:11.856 --> 00:17:14.970
you've gotten some very promising thing so when they

390
00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:19.066
first do the study theres an exaggeration in its affect size

391
00:17:19.066 --> 00:17:22.981
just due to random chance and so when you run the studies

392
00:17:22.981 --> 00:17:25.242
again, the replications, they're just are not as good

393
00:17:25.242 --> 00:17:28.698
because in effect you got lucky the first time.

394
00:17:28.698 --> 00:17:31.993
<v Voiceover>Yeah, what about the potential of even,</v>

395
00:17:31.993 --> 00:17:34.127
I mean we've heard about this from some of the very very

396
00:17:34.127 --> 00:17:36.942
you know, the largest drug manufacturers,

397
00:17:36.942 --> 00:17:40.195
that theres even sometimes corrupted studies to begin with,

398
00:17:40.195 --> 00:17:42.137
so have to allow for corrupted studies,

399
00:17:42.137 --> 00:17:43.950
where there is a little benefit in there

400
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:45.070
for having a certain finding.

401
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.712
So lets rule that out right off

402
00:17:46.712 --> 00:17:48.014
because we know that does exist.

403
00:17:48.014 --> 00:17:50.243
But you're saying where theres been legitimate

404
00:17:50.243 --> 00:17:51.245
research done.

405
00:17:51.245 --> 00:17:54.744
<v ->Right legitimate research and they did everything</v>

406
00:17:54.744 --> 00:17:57.677
right or reasonably right but just sometime

407
00:17:57.677 --> 00:18:00.045
you're gonna get, you're always gonna get some random

408
00:18:00.045 --> 00:18:02.061
noise that also is associated with whatever

409
00:18:02.061 --> 00:18:04.429
your two conditions are, theres always random noise in

410
00:18:04.429 --> 00:18:07.543
studies that involve drugs or anything of that sort

411
00:18:07.543 --> 00:18:10.146
and that noise can work either for you

412
00:18:10.146 --> 00:18:13.164
or against you and in sometimes its gonna work

413
00:18:13.164 --> 00:18:15.649
in the favour of a difference between the drug

414
00:18:15.649 --> 00:18:20.012
and the placebo and thats going to create an exaggeration.

415
00:18:20.012 --> 00:18:23.723
Another possibility is changes in people's expectations.

416
00:18:23.723 --> 00:18:28.438
People may have either increased belief in the drug,

417
00:18:28.438 --> 00:18:30.016
or a decrease belief in the drug,

418
00:18:30.016 --> 00:18:32.064
they may have heard about other people who had

419
00:18:32.064 --> 00:18:34.805
good affects or bad affects of it and now its gonna

420
00:18:34.805 --> 00:18:38.560
then change the belief set of people who are taking it

421
00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.608
and they are not going to be as naive about it

422
00:18:40.608 --> 00:18:43.534
and so changes in actually understanding about

423
00:18:43.534 --> 00:18:46.649
what the drug may or may not do could change its overall

424
00:18:46.649 --> 00:18:49.742
efficacy and the difference between it and the placebo.

425
00:18:49.742 --> 00:18:51.224
<v Voiceover>Yeah that makes sense.</v>

426
00:18:51.224 --> 00:18:55.661
It also, this is just kind of on a, again a biological

427
00:18:55.661 --> 00:18:58.819
feeling level, when we first take a drug its normally

428
00:18:58.819 --> 00:19:01.389
the stimulate the body into an opposite reaction

429
00:19:01.389 --> 00:19:05.133
and it would seems over time the body may just become

430
00:19:05.133 --> 00:19:09.591
habituated or even inresonance energetically with the drug

431
00:19:09.591 --> 00:19:12.002
to the extent that its just part of the normal fabric,

432
00:19:12.002 --> 00:19:14.839
its not shocking the system into the effect anymore.

433
00:19:14.839 --> 00:19:18.039
<v ->Well and that would certainly be the case for when you</v>

434
00:19:18.039 --> 00:19:21.942
see declines in individuals response to the drug.

435
00:19:21.942 --> 00:19:24.566
A lot of these studies are with different populations

436
00:19:24.566 --> 00:19:26.561
and thats on the things that make it so interesting,

437
00:19:26.561 --> 00:19:28.651
its just that, theres one group and then

438
00:19:28.651 --> 00:19:29.931
you do it with a different group

439
00:19:29.931 --> 00:19:31.670
and that group is not showing the same response

440
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.995
as the first group did and then the third group

441
00:19:33.995 --> 00:19:35.595
is showing even a lesser response,

442
00:19:35.595 --> 00:19:38.475
so its actually across populations you see this,

443
00:19:38.475 --> 00:19:42.794
Decline Affect which makes it that much more remarkable

444
00:19:42.794 --> 00:19:44.847
because its harder to explain and then yeah,

445
00:19:44.847 --> 00:19:47.194
after a while people are just getting used to whatever

446
00:19:47.194 --> 00:19:48.164
the drug is

447
00:19:48.164 --> 00:19:50.703
<v Voiceover>Another area is medical intervention.</v>

448
00:19:50.703 --> 00:19:51.556
<v ->Yeah</v>

449
00:19:51.556 --> 00:19:53.135
<v Voiceover>So maybe you could talk about that</v>

450
00:19:53.135 --> 00:19:54.628
a little bit, what was noticed there?

451
00:19:54.628 --> 00:19:56.996
<v ->Well, in this study what was done is,</v>

452
00:19:56.996 --> 00:20:01.166
they looked at most cited intervention studies

453
00:20:01.166 --> 00:20:05.443
that the drugs as well as other types of interventions

454
00:20:05.443 --> 00:20:08.227
and they looked to see to what percentage of that

455
00:20:08.227 --> 00:20:13.227
replicated and 40% of the most cited studies

456
00:20:13.571 --> 00:20:16.099
either were contra-indicated, that is,

457
00:20:16.099 --> 00:20:18.488
whatever it was actually worked in reverse,

458
00:20:18.488 --> 00:20:22.210
it was non-effective or less effective than the

459
00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.439
initial reported study.

460
00:20:24.439 --> 00:20:28.194
40%, so its a really dramatic proportion are showing

461
00:20:28.194 --> 00:20:30.028
something that would be very akin to what

462
00:20:30.028 --> 00:20:31.607
I'm calling the Decline Affect.

463
00:20:31.607 --> 00:20:34.796
<v Voiceover>And then the third one that you were talking</v>

464
00:20:34.796 --> 00:20:37.047
about yesterday is even meta analysis

465
00:20:37.047 --> 00:20:38.860
in the world of biology.

466
00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.014
<v ->Yeah. And you might think that if you were just</v>

467
00:20:41.014 --> 00:20:45.825
looking at, you know, animals were theres no expectation,

468
00:20:45.825 --> 00:20:48.673
you would think that you would just be very consistent

469
00:20:48.673 --> 00:20:51.510
affects but what this study did was to look at the

470
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:55.104
relationship between variables, you know,

471
00:20:55.104 --> 00:20:56.875
number of different biological studies

472
00:20:56.875 --> 00:21:00.405
and what a meta analysis is already looking at a

473
00:21:00.405 --> 00:21:02.560
number of different studies, so this was actually a

474
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.653
meta analysis of meta analysis, so hundred

475
00:21:05.653 --> 00:21:09.717
and hundred of studies were included in this analysis

476
00:21:09.717 --> 00:21:11.434
and basically what happened was is that,

477
00:21:11.434 --> 00:21:15.380
all the findings that were reported in subsequent years,

478
00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:19.049
were smaller than they were in the initial reports

479
00:21:19.049 --> 00:21:22.686
and again this gradual Decline, so you know,

480
00:21:22.686 --> 00:21:25.433
just very striking the same thing that I have seen

481
00:21:25.433 --> 00:21:27.065
in my lab in a number of different domains

482
00:21:27.065 --> 00:21:30.360
has also been observed in all these other areas.

483
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.728
Now theres certain other areas that don't seem to see it.

484
00:21:32.728 --> 00:21:36.184
We don't see in physics, as far as I know,

485
00:21:36.184 --> 00:21:38.328
there maybe some exceptions but you know,

486
00:21:38.328 --> 00:21:41.624
ball still roll down inclines the same rate that they did

487
00:21:41.624 --> 00:21:43.458
when Galileo was doing it, so theres some things

488
00:21:43.458 --> 00:21:47.149
that stay constant but in a whole variety of different

489
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:49.794
domains we see this peculiar shrinkage

490
00:21:49.794 --> 00:21:51.532
in the magnitude of affect.

491
00:21:51.532 --> 00:21:53.186
<v Voiceover>Now does this work in your</v>

492
00:21:53.186 --> 00:21:56.087
presenting with Dean Raiden, also with Derrel

493
00:21:56.087 --> 00:21:57.665
who is doing the physic experiments

494
00:21:57.665 --> 00:21:59.681
which the crowd participated in,

495
00:21:59.681 --> 00:22:01.334
which was quite interesting,

496
00:22:01.334 --> 00:22:06.334
in the experiments that preceded your presentation

497
00:22:06.998 --> 00:22:10.091
yesterday, you had people staring at a screen

498
00:22:10.091 --> 00:22:12.918
that had two little boxes on it

499
00:22:12.918 --> 00:22:15.957
and you had to allow yourself to very naturally be

500
00:22:15.957 --> 00:22:19.072
drawn to the box you thought that the image was going

501
00:22:19.072 --> 00:22:21.877
to appear in, you had right or left that was it,

502
00:22:21.877 --> 00:22:24.992
and it was Dean Raiden's work were observation

503
00:22:24.992 --> 00:22:26.570
affects outcomes.

504
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:29.866
Now in the Decline Affect how does all of this

505
00:22:29.866 --> 00:22:32.682
potentially blend together.

506
00:22:32.682 --> 00:22:35.626
<v ->Well one prediction that it makes is a</v>

507
00:22:35.626 --> 00:22:37.929
slightly disheartening one, which is that when

508
00:22:37.929 --> 00:22:40.575
other researchers or even when they set out

509
00:22:40.575 --> 00:22:42.132
to try to replicate these studies,

510
00:22:42.132 --> 00:22:43.540
that they are going to have a harder time of it,

511
00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.676
that its going to be less possible to get the effect

512
00:22:46.676 --> 00:22:50.761
as they observed so strongly in their initial studies

513
00:22:50.761 --> 00:22:55.705
and the intriguing interpretation is that it doesn't mean

514
00:22:55.705 --> 00:22:58.328
that their studies were wrong initially but that somehow

515
00:22:58.328 --> 00:23:01.208
they were subject to this Decline Affect so that

516
00:23:01.208 --> 00:23:06.208
real affects just dwindle in magnitude with time

517
00:23:06.499 --> 00:23:09.282
and this of course is very difficult to sell

518
00:23:09.282 --> 00:23:12.279
when you tell a skeptic, "Oh well the reason you can't

519
00:23:12.279 --> 00:23:15.789
"replicate my study is because its time

520
00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:17.058
"but it was really there"

521
00:23:17.058 --> 00:23:21.015
you know thats a tough sell but on the other hand

522
00:23:21.015 --> 00:23:22.753
we don't really understand whats

523
00:23:22.753 --> 00:23:24.119
going on with the Decline Affect

524
00:23:24.119 --> 00:23:29.068
and so to dismiss that as an account is really

525
00:23:29.068 --> 00:23:30.764
not appropriate either.

526
00:23:30.764 --> 00:23:33.483
The really interesting thing is that what,

527
00:23:33.483 --> 00:23:38.483
for example, Dean Raiden, he never totally

528
00:23:38.614 --> 00:23:40.768
replicates his study, he is always trying different things

529
00:23:40.768 --> 00:23:45.032
and Derrel Bem, what he did was not to mime at

530
00:23:45.032 --> 00:23:48.392
same experiments mime conceptually related experiments

531
00:23:48.392 --> 00:23:51.528
but each one somewhat different and so what people really

532
00:23:51.528 --> 00:23:55.175
I think need to do is to go out and try variations

533
00:23:55.175 --> 00:23:57.799
on these experiments and see if they can get

534
00:23:57.799 --> 00:24:01.394
those to work and so the discouraging prediction

535
00:24:01.394 --> 00:24:03.228
is that if you try to do a perfect replication,

536
00:24:03.228 --> 00:24:05.340
its not going to work so well but if you do

537
00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:09.596
a conceptual replication, a variation on it, thats novel,

538
00:24:09.596 --> 00:24:12.736
that that should produce very powerful effects initially

539
00:24:12.736 --> 00:24:15.659
and I hope that open minded people will go out there

540
00:24:15.659 --> 00:24:17.867
and try something new for themselves

541
00:24:17.867 --> 00:24:19.936
which is what I did, we tried a variation

542
00:24:19.936 --> 00:24:24.789
on Derell's paradigm and we got a very powerful affect.

543
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:28.063
It did Decline but we got a really good affect

544
00:24:28.063 --> 00:24:30.357
and then watched it gradually go away too.

545
00:24:30.357 --> 00:24:32.148
<v Voiceover>Well yesterday I think you got a</v>

546
00:24:32.148 --> 00:24:34.239
pretty positive one, certainly well more,

547
00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:36.809
well over half the people in the room

548
00:24:36.809 --> 00:24:39.924
got over half of the images correct

549
00:24:39.924 --> 00:24:41.620
and thats kind of what they're looking for,

550
00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:45.385
as what 53% right in there that 3% differential

551
00:24:45.385 --> 00:24:47.913
is actually significant when you're studying in

552
00:24:47.913 --> 00:24:50.793
para-psychology fields of consciousness.

553
00:24:50.793 --> 00:24:52.371
<v ->But he did say that that was the first time</v>

554
00:24:52.371 --> 00:24:55.432
that he'd ever tried that, this study in this kind of

555
00:24:55.432 --> 00:24:58.387
context in a group context so I would predict,

556
00:24:58.387 --> 00:25:02.056
that if he were to try to do that same demonstration

557
00:25:02.056 --> 00:25:04.029
version of the study to a new group

558
00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:05.693
its not gonna work as well,

559
00:25:05.693 --> 00:25:08.114
so I would say what he got was the first hit

560
00:25:08.114 --> 00:25:11.922
of a new version of his paradigm that worked really well,

561
00:25:11.922 --> 00:25:13.682
now hes gonna go do it again thinking,

562
00:25:13.682 --> 00:25:14.940
"Wow, this really works well"

563
00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:18.076
and next time you're not gonna see so many hands go up.

564
00:25:18.076 --> 00:25:19.047
That would be my prediction.

565
00:25:19.047 --> 00:25:19.815
<v Voiceover>I should find out,</v>

566
00:25:19.815 --> 00:25:20.903
aren't you guys doing this in a

567
00:25:20.903 --> 00:25:21.927
<v ->Thats right yeah, come back</v>

568
00:25:21.927 --> 00:25:22.993
<v Voiceover>Doing this in another hour</v>

569
00:25:22.993 --> 00:25:26.033
<v ->Come back, we got a prediction, you watch</v>

570
00:25:26.033 --> 00:25:27.825
<v Voiceover>I think there should be decline in</v>

571
00:25:27.825 --> 00:25:28.966
<v ->Theres gonna be a decline</v>

572
00:25:28.966 --> 00:25:31.046
<v Voiceover>Now I know this kind of free association</v>

573
00:25:31.046 --> 00:25:36.046
here but does Dean Raiden's work were the affect

574
00:25:36.208 --> 00:25:39.227
of the observer on the outcome have anything.

575
00:25:39.227 --> 00:25:40.987
Do you think that might be tied into this?

576
00:25:40.987 --> 00:25:45.987
<v ->Again, when I put all my open minded,</v>

577
00:25:47.237 --> 00:25:49.157
when I put my open minded hat on,

578
00:25:49.157 --> 00:25:54.127
I and I should say I do wear my open minded hat in public

579
00:25:54.127 --> 00:25:59.127
so I mentioned this in a commentary that wrote In Nature

580
00:25:59.172 --> 00:26:02.833
which is the sort of the premiere mainstream journal

581
00:26:02.833 --> 00:26:06.502
and I mentioned the possibility that one interpretation

582
00:26:06.502 --> 00:26:09.872
of the Decline Affect is very akin to the

583
00:26:09.872 --> 00:26:12.912
Hizenburg uncertainty, where the active observation,

584
00:26:12.912 --> 00:26:15.077
in this case the active scientific observation

585
00:26:15.077 --> 00:26:17.808
of a phenomenon might somehow change the

586
00:26:17.808 --> 00:26:18.928
phenomenon itself.

587
00:26:18.928 --> 00:26:20.826
Now this is a, if you really think through

588
00:26:20.826 --> 00:26:22.853
what I'm saying here, its a really radical idea.

589
00:26:22.853 --> 00:26:23.685
<v Voiceover>Absolutely</v>

590
00:26:23.685 --> 00:26:24.922
<v ->Because what its suggesting is that</v>

591
00:26:24.922 --> 00:26:28.698
again tentatively, just as one possible variety,

592
00:26:28.698 --> 00:26:31.140
out of a set of possibilities, its suggesting that

593
00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.743
the act of observing phenomenon might actually

594
00:26:33.743 --> 00:26:36.665
change the rules of nature in some way.

595
00:26:36.665 --> 00:26:40.260
That the rules of nature may not be immutable

596
00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.382
as is always assumed and that through

597
00:26:42.382 --> 00:26:45.070
the process of observation we may actually shape

598
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:48.622
and change whats actually going on.

599
00:26:48.622 --> 00:26:50.574
<v Voiceover>Which I find fascinating</v>

600
00:26:50.574 --> 00:26:52.664
and then this is where we morph over

601
00:26:52.664 --> 00:26:55.640
into Rupert Cheldrik's morphogenic field work

602
00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.509
because as he talks about in various simple

603
00:26:58.509 --> 00:27:01.250
and often replicate it, I will be curious to know about his

604
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.904
Decline Affect in his studies.

605
00:27:02.904 --> 00:27:06.754
The notion of a person watching the back of another

606
00:27:06.754 --> 00:27:10.636
head to observe or look at or focus your attention

607
00:27:10.636 --> 00:27:12.375
on the back of someone else's head

608
00:27:12.375 --> 00:27:15.415
specifically more often then not, a personal

609
00:27:15.415 --> 00:27:18.193
react and turn around, I watched that on the street today,

610
00:27:18.193 --> 00:27:19.489
as a matter of fact, just thinking about it

611
00:27:19.489 --> 00:27:21.761
and its amazing, you can just glance at someone

612
00:27:21.761 --> 00:27:25.878
its amazing how often the other person is being glanced at

613
00:27:25.878 --> 00:27:28.897
from behind or automatically just turns to the ground,

614
00:27:28.897 --> 00:27:31.766
theres something that appears to be very powerful

615
00:27:31.766 --> 00:27:36.203
about the focussed consciousness that seems to come from

616
00:27:36.203 --> 00:27:39.275
observation, very powerful

617
00:27:39.275 --> 00:27:41.589
<v ->Yeah, the funny thing about that phenomenon</v>

618
00:27:41.589 --> 00:27:43.189
is that we even kind of know what it feels like,

619
00:27:43.189 --> 00:27:45.472
this sort of a feeling on the back of your neck,

620
00:27:45.472 --> 00:27:48.234
that we think we experience when someone's

621
00:27:48.234 --> 00:27:51.743
looking at us and the research on that is really

622
00:27:51.743 --> 00:27:54.708
pretty compelling.

623
00:27:54.708 --> 00:27:59.327
Rupert tells me that hes not seen a Decline Affect

624
00:27:59.327 --> 00:28:02.974
with that particular paradigm which I find interesting

625
00:28:02.974 --> 00:28:07.081
but he has seen Decline Affects with some other paradigms

626
00:28:07.081 --> 00:28:09.171
and his accounting of it is that,

627
00:28:09.171 --> 00:28:12.542
when he has paradigms in which there is say

628
00:28:12.542 --> 00:28:15.326
one right answer and a number of wrong answers

629
00:28:15.326 --> 00:28:17.491
that what happens is that people get discouraged

630
00:28:17.491 --> 00:28:21.853
and its the discouraged experience that leads to the

631
00:28:21.853 --> 00:28:24.946
Decline Affect and so hes now changed his paradigms

632
00:28:24.946 --> 00:28:28.466
to have a one right and one wrong to increase the

633
00:28:28.466 --> 00:28:31.303
proportion of time that induviduals can be right

634
00:28:31.303 --> 00:28:34.439
and with the speculation that that would lead to

635
00:28:34.439 --> 00:28:37.660
a smaller Decline affect in his paradigms.

636
00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.079
<v Voiceover>That makes sense and thats that more</v>

637
00:28:39.079 --> 00:28:41.841
reflex the little experiment done yesterday,

638
00:28:41.841 --> 00:28:43.441
they have the right or the left,

639
00:28:43.441 --> 00:28:45.532
you know, choose now, boom boom, you have to choose

640
00:28:45.532 --> 00:28:48.417
and that makes sense and thats exactly when we first

641
00:28:48.417 --> 00:28:50.785
started talking what I was feeling about this

642
00:28:50.785 --> 00:28:53.110
beginners luck and the Decline Affect,

643
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:55.542
is there is this feeling that happens naturally

644
00:28:55.542 --> 00:28:59.051
over being discouraged, thats very the emotional field

645
00:28:59.051 --> 00:29:02.069
that has to have a very powerful affect on the larger field.

646
00:29:02.069 --> 00:29:06.592
<v ->It certainly might, I think thats an interesting</v>

647
00:29:06.592 --> 00:29:10.357
accounting, I still also think that theres a possibility

648
00:29:10.357 --> 00:29:13.258
that there maybe some sort of inverse to this

649
00:29:13.258 --> 00:29:15.882
morphogenic field idea where he argues that

650
00:29:15.882 --> 00:29:19.178
when sort of things get on to the

651
00:29:19.178 --> 00:29:22.036
global consciousness stage, the affects get larger

652
00:29:22.036 --> 00:29:24.596
and there maybe some other way, some inverse of that

653
00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:26.377
where under some circumstances,

654
00:29:26.377 --> 00:29:28.905
when things get on that stage affects get

655
00:29:28.905 --> 00:29:31.742
smaller, that the Decline Affect maybe some

656
00:29:31.742 --> 00:29:35.785
peculiar inverse of morphogenic field type

657
00:29:35.785 --> 00:29:37.342
of phenomenon that we just sort of need to

658
00:29:37.342 --> 00:29:40.478
better understand when the one kind of situation applies

659
00:29:40.478 --> 00:29:42.216
and when the other applies and

660
00:29:42.216 --> 00:29:44.680
the many situations in which neither may apply.

661
00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.091
<v Voiceover>I find all of it fascinating and</v>

662
00:29:47.091 --> 00:29:49.106
I don't find it intimidating at all.

663
00:29:49.106 --> 00:29:51.250
Makes sense to me because on some visceral level

664
00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:55.655
I can also feel it and see the energy moving in that way.

665
00:29:55.655 --> 00:29:58.631
Any final thoughts on this as far as what you're finding

666
00:29:58.631 --> 00:30:02.938
exciting about, what maybe bumping into here in the future?

667
00:30:02.938 --> 00:30:06.543
<v ->Well I think that what this calls for</v>

668
00:30:06.543 --> 00:30:11.396
is a mixture of two, what might seem to be

669
00:30:11.396 --> 00:30:13.646
really really different instincts.

670
00:30:13.646 --> 00:30:16.665
One instinct is for open mindedness

671
00:30:16.665 --> 00:30:19.054
and to really sort of embrace some of the radical

672
00:30:19.054 --> 00:30:21.817
ideas that we've been talking about here

673
00:30:21.817 --> 00:30:24.515
but the other instinct which is often times

674
00:30:24.515 --> 00:30:26.766
treated as really being the opposite of that,

675
00:30:26.766 --> 00:30:30.552
but I think go hand in hand is to be very very rigourous

676
00:30:30.552 --> 00:30:34.776
and in fact to insist that science show a level of rigour

677
00:30:34.776 --> 00:30:37.634
across domains that it doesn't currently show.

678
00:30:37.634 --> 00:30:38.936
Let me explain what I mean by that.

679
00:30:38.936 --> 00:30:42.210
Currently the only scientific findings that

680
00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:44.247
are made available to the public record

681
00:30:44.247 --> 00:30:46.103
are those that go through this very

682
00:30:46.103 --> 00:30:48.492
convoluted publication process.

683
00:30:48.492 --> 00:30:51.287
Lots of data, lots of results, lots of conditions

684
00:30:51.287 --> 00:30:54.465
never make it into the public record.

685
00:30:54.465 --> 00:30:57.622
And thats the way scientific method is done

686
00:30:57.622 --> 00:31:00.268
and what this means is that we don't know

687
00:31:00.268 --> 00:31:01.569
when we have a published result,

688
00:31:01.569 --> 00:31:03.563
we don't know how that fits into the larger body

689
00:31:03.563 --> 00:31:05.633
of collected data, so its very hard to know

690
00:31:05.633 --> 00:31:08.331
how these big initial affects,

691
00:31:08.331 --> 00:31:10.070
how many studies didn't work?

692
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:11.158
<v Voiceover>Yeah, prominent it is, yeah.</v>

693
00:31:11.158 --> 00:31:12.757
<v ->How many? We just don't know,</v>

694
00:31:12.757 --> 00:31:14.901
so what we really need to do is,

695
00:31:14.901 --> 00:31:16.565
we don't know when researchers did it

696
00:31:16.565 --> 00:31:18.517
what are the things did they try or not try.

697
00:31:18.517 --> 00:31:20.960
What I think we need to do is change how

698
00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.650
science is done to basically how scientists log

699
00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:27.530
ahead of time, what it is that they are planning to do

700
00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:31.594
in some open source database and then after they collect

701
00:31:31.594 --> 00:31:34.004
the data, after they've gone through the publication process

702
00:31:34.004 --> 00:31:37.396
theres been an appropriate period to get the work published,

703
00:31:37.396 --> 00:31:39.582
no matter what, its made available,

704
00:31:39.582 --> 00:31:43.667
so that we have a more transparency in the scientific

705
00:31:43.667 --> 00:31:46.750
process and I think its only by introducing that level of

706
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:49.118
transparency that we will be really be able to understand

707
00:31:49.118 --> 00:31:51.027
the nature of the Decline Affect

708
00:31:51.027 --> 00:31:54.163
and what I think may happen is that when we introduce

709
00:31:54.163 --> 00:31:57.853
this greater level of transparency, we may see that a lot of

710
00:31:57.853 --> 00:32:00.104
the conventional explanations which at present

711
00:32:00.104 --> 00:32:02.546
still need seriously kept on the table,

712
00:32:02.546 --> 00:32:05.906
are insufficient and that it maybe that actually

713
00:32:05.906 --> 00:32:08.434
through greater rigour that we may come to

714
00:32:08.434 --> 00:32:11.527
appreciate some of the more subtle energy processes

715
00:32:11.527 --> 00:32:12.850
that could be involved.

716
00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:13.991
<v Voiceover>That makes total sense</v>

717
00:32:13.991 --> 00:32:15.868
and besides that it sounds more,

718
00:32:15.868 --> 00:32:18.908
almost more democratic and more representative

719
00:32:18.908 --> 00:32:20.348
in terms of results.

720
00:32:20.348 --> 00:32:23.185
Its not just a certain elite name or two that

721
00:32:23.185 --> 00:32:25.969
are published and thats the end of the story.

722
00:32:25.969 --> 00:32:28.433
That may, what you say makes a lot of sense.

723
00:32:28.433 --> 00:32:30.747
Its very inviting.

724
00:32:30.747 --> 00:32:34.235
<v ->And I think its doable and that it would have to,</v>

725
00:32:34.235 --> 00:32:37.296
you still have to have rigour and you would have to

726
00:32:37.296 --> 00:32:39.205
make sure that theres documentation of

727
00:32:39.205 --> 00:32:42.064
how the study was done so it wouldn't mean

728
00:32:42.064 --> 00:32:43.450
that you could just sort of willy nilly report

729
00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:46.704
anything but it would provide a way of

730
00:32:46.704 --> 00:32:50.198
introducing a level of transparency to the scientific

731
00:32:50.198 --> 00:32:52.982
process thats not currently available

732
00:32:52.982 --> 00:32:55.648
and who knows what remarkable aspects

733
00:32:55.648 --> 00:32:57.931
about nature we might discover as a result.

734
00:32:57.931 --> 00:33:00.107
<v Voiceover>Thank you so much</v>

735
00:33:00.107 --> 00:33:02.080
<v ->Its my pleasure</v>

736
00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.914
<v ->For more on this kind of</v>
