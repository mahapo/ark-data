00:00:00.831 --> 00:00:03.511
ï»¿- Steven Ross calls himself a librarian.

2
00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:06.672
In truth, he carries a vast wealth of esoteric knowledge

3
00:00:06.672 --> 00:00:08.833
that he's groomed throughout his lifetime.

4
00:00:08.833 --> 00:00:10.133
In pursuit of the truth,

5
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.753
he established the World Research Foundation

6
00:00:12.753 --> 00:00:14.633
which is dedicated to helping others

7
00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:16.953
find knowledge regarding health and healing.

8
00:00:16.953 --> 00:00:18.653
From ancient Thomson alchemy

9
00:00:18.653 --> 00:00:21.373
to the latest breakthroughs in healing technologies,

10
00:00:21.373 --> 00:00:24.553
you can find an array of information on any known disease

11
00:00:24.553 --> 00:00:27.193
and the cures that have been used throughout history.

12
00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.753
Above and beyond this, however,

13
00:00:28.753 --> 00:00:30.913
Steven is a Renaissance man

14
00:00:30.913 --> 00:00:33.753
who lives his life true to his guiding principle

15
00:00:33.753 --> 00:00:35.653
which he calls LEFL,

16
00:00:35.653 --> 00:00:39.373
the most elevated of truths is that a beauty and balance.

17
00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:42.194
Here Steven speaks on the essence of feminine beauty

18
00:00:42.194 --> 00:00:45.264
and its eccentric value to our lives.

19
00:00:54.694 --> 00:00:58.094
You are known for having gathered some of the most

20
00:00:58.094 --> 00:01:02.374
beautiful obscure and profound information in the world

21
00:01:02.374 --> 00:01:04.754
through the World Research Foundation.

22
00:01:04.754 --> 00:01:06.915
But at the foundation of your own being

23
00:01:06.915 --> 00:01:09.895
and your own life is something intrinsically

24
00:01:09.895 --> 00:01:13.135
much more essential to you, is that fair to say?

25
00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:14.075
<v ->It's very fair.</v>

26
00:01:14.075 --> 00:01:15.975
<v Voiceover>And that is beauty</v>

27
00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:20.975
which is one of those missing links that modern culture

28
00:01:21.717 --> 00:01:23.437
seems to have forgotten about

29
00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:26.017
and you seemed to have completely exemplified

30
00:01:26.017 --> 00:01:28.917
in this extraordinary room we're sitting in.

31
00:01:28.917 --> 00:01:30.997
<v ->Thank you and I believe</v>

32
00:01:30.997 --> 00:01:34.157
very strongly in the aspects of beauty.

33
00:01:34.157 --> 00:01:37.478
Perhaps it's because this is a room patterned after

34
00:01:37.478 --> 00:01:39.598
the Renaissance period,

35
00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:42.500
the rooms were called studio lows.

36
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.120
And this studio low that I've created,

37
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.303
the main function is to immerse somebody into beautiful.

38
00:01:50.303 --> 00:01:52.943
The ancients very well knew

39
00:01:52.943 --> 00:01:56.223
that whatever you surround yourself with,

40
00:01:56.223 --> 00:01:58.463
that you will eventually become.

41
00:01:58.463 --> 00:02:03.463
And so the ancient Greeks in their cities did not allow

42
00:02:04.363 --> 00:02:06.823
this coordinate notes in their music,

43
00:02:06.823 --> 00:02:10.549
they didn't have buildings that have had outlandish colors.

44
00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.189
They believe that if you surround yourself with rhythm,

45
00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.109
harmony, line and beauty,

46
00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:19.429
that you will eventually become that.

47
00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:22.529
And although I have the background in athletics,

48
00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:24.989
in sports, in science,

49
00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.629
when I became interested in philosophy,

50
00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.829
the main aspect that really grabbed me, Regina,

51
00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.409
was this whole concept of beauty.

52
00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.769
But, underneath it all

53
00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.830
and throughout our conversation,

54
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.630
my main emphasis has been on a four-letter word.

55
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.490
And that four-letter word and this philosophy

56
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.187
that I have tried to espouse and live is called LEFL.

57
00:02:49.187 --> 00:02:50.167
<v Voiceover>LEFL?</v>

58
00:02:50.167 --> 00:02:54.027
<v ->LEFL, L-E-F-L.</v>

59
00:02:54.027 --> 00:02:55.851
And it stands for

60
00:02:55.851 --> 00:03:00.402
Laughter Excitement Fun and Love.

61
00:03:01.452 --> 00:03:04.252
<v Voiceover>That's the golden</v>

62
00:03:04.252 --> 00:03:06.112
formula, for life.

63
00:03:06.112 --> 00:03:08.692
<v ->For me it's the golden formula, LEFL.</v>

64
00:03:08.692 --> 00:03:10.912
And when I do my counseling work

65
00:03:10.912 --> 00:03:14.772
or let's call it sharing with thousands of people

66
00:03:14.772 --> 00:03:17.232
over this last 30 some years,

67
00:03:17.232 --> 00:03:20.232
actually it's a little scary for me, 35 years,

68
00:03:20.232 --> 00:03:23.092
what I do is I check their LEFL meter.

69
00:03:23.092 --> 00:03:25.252
How is their LEFL meter doing?

70
00:03:25.252 --> 00:03:26.732
And I have found

71
00:03:26.732 --> 00:03:28.372
that the people that who have come

72
00:03:28.372 --> 00:03:30.652
into World Research Foundation

73
00:03:30.652 --> 00:03:32.272
who I have worked with,

74
00:03:32.272 --> 00:03:37.172
they are devoid in one or all of those categories

75
00:03:37.172 --> 00:03:38.652
and they have a problem.

76
00:03:38.652 --> 00:03:42.692
Because you see, when you have laughter,

77
00:03:42.692 --> 00:03:46.692
excitement, fun, and love in your life,

78
00:03:46.692 --> 00:03:50.932
there is no room for illness or disease or health problems.

79
00:03:50.932 --> 00:03:54.592
And it's not been unusual for us to recommend

80
00:03:54.592 --> 00:03:57.392
to the people who come to see us

81
00:03:57.392 --> 00:04:01.772
something that will juice up or replenish

82
00:04:01.772 --> 00:04:04.652
one of those areas, so it's LEFL.

83
00:04:04.652 --> 00:04:07.002
<v Voiceover>LEFL, okay I--</v>

84
00:04:07.002 --> 00:04:08.727
<v ->You heard it here. this is where it starts.</v>

85
00:04:08.727 --> 00:04:09.827
<v Voiceover>We heard it here</v>

86
00:04:09.827 --> 00:04:12.087
and I couldn't agree more with you.

87
00:04:12.087 --> 00:04:16.147
And where is beauty in the equation, in the LEFL equation?

88
00:04:16.147 --> 00:04:17.326
<v ->It's all beauty,</v>

89
00:04:17.326 --> 00:04:20.687
because beauty to a beholder

90
00:04:20.687 --> 00:04:24.715
is something where the line or proportion is pleasing.

91
00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:26.585
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

92
00:04:26.585 --> 00:04:29.925
<v ->So, beauty maybe relative from person to person,</v>

93
00:04:29.925 --> 00:04:33.142
however, it's not relative to an individual

94
00:04:33.142 --> 00:04:35.183
from this standpoint.

95
00:04:35.183 --> 00:04:40.063
Something, someone, an object nature is beautiful to you

96
00:04:40.063 --> 00:04:42.642
because it speaks to you.

97
00:04:42.642 --> 00:04:47.023
There is a rhythm, a harmony, a balance

98
00:04:47.023 --> 00:04:49.943
that makes it beautiful for you.

99
00:04:49.943 --> 00:04:52.243
Now for somebody else, perhaps,

100
00:04:52.243 --> 00:04:54.583
they don't see the lines the same way,

101
00:04:54.583 --> 00:04:56.083
it doesn't hit them

102
00:04:56.083 --> 00:05:00.263
so they don't feel that beauty from that object,

103
00:05:00.263 --> 00:05:03.663
but they do have something that is beautiful for them.

104
00:05:03.663 --> 00:05:06.843
So when you have laughter,

105
00:05:06.843 --> 00:05:10.282
excitement, fun and love,

106
00:05:10.282 --> 00:05:12.863
you are in beauty,

107
00:05:12.863 --> 00:05:14.483
of beauty,

108
00:05:14.483 --> 00:05:16.263
you are walking in beauty,

109
00:05:16.263 --> 00:05:18.522
and you are living in beauty.

110
00:05:18.522 --> 00:05:19.523
<v Voiceover>And then you have</v>

111
00:05:19.523 --> 00:05:22.362
the external vibrational factors of beauty as well

112
00:05:22.362 --> 00:05:24.243
such as what we're surrounded with here

113
00:05:24.243 --> 00:05:27.583
and you have had in this extraordinary space you've created,

114
00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:29.942
I'd like to find out

115
00:05:29.942 --> 00:05:31.902
the genesis if this creation.

116
00:05:31.902 --> 00:05:33.443
But also, we've turned the music down

117
00:05:33.443 --> 00:05:36.783
which you have had running 24/7 for, how long?

118
00:05:36.783 --> 00:05:38.142
<v ->Three and a half years.</v>

119
00:05:38.142 --> 00:05:39.923
<v Voiceover>Three and a half years and thank you so much</v>

120
00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:43.843
just for our editing purposes that you turned it down for us

121
00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:46.903
just a little bit a little while here.

122
00:05:46.903 --> 00:05:49.399
<v ->It has had an intent in the room.</v>

123
00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:54.212
The intent is the classical masters of all time.

124
00:05:54.212 --> 00:05:56.892
I had music playing during the construction.

125
00:05:56.892 --> 00:06:01.092
In fact, I had a patio garden here

126
00:06:01.092 --> 00:06:05.311
that I took down and lot of my neighbors are going,

127
00:06:05.311 --> 00:06:07.072
"He's mad, he's gotta be crazy.

128
00:06:07.072 --> 00:06:08.492
"What is he doing?"

129
00:06:08.492 --> 00:06:12.252
And I wanted to create this beautiful room

130
00:06:12.252 --> 00:06:15.791
so music played during the construction period.

131
00:06:15.791 --> 00:06:18.612
Music played all the time

132
00:06:18.612 --> 00:06:20.831
and so the intent of this room

133
00:06:20.831 --> 00:06:22.552
which I'm not the first to do this

134
00:06:22.552 --> 00:06:25.652
because the ancients knew very well about this,

135
00:06:25.652 --> 00:06:29.812
the music has permeated this entire space

136
00:06:29.812 --> 00:06:34.812
on a continuing basis on a random play CD

137
00:06:35.332 --> 00:06:39.409
that has, in this particular room, 200 CDs that just

138
00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:41.470
randomly played the classics.

139
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.250
But the initial impulse for me came

140
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.030
when I was flying back from my office in Stuttgart, Germany.

141
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.730
It was about a month and a half before 9/11

142
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.967
and I kept it in this impulse, there is beauty.

143
00:06:55.967 --> 00:06:57.528
Donât forget the beauty of the world,

144
00:06:57.528 --> 00:06:59.866
don't forget love.

145
00:06:59.866 --> 00:07:03.526
And I was kind of thinking to myself,

146
00:07:03.526 --> 00:07:05.366
what are these thoughts I'm having?

147
00:07:05.366 --> 00:07:08.386
And then the entire room came to me.

148
00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:12.226
I saw this picture of this room as it is

149
00:07:12.226 --> 00:07:14.486
as you are seeing it

150
00:07:14.486 --> 00:07:16.745
with specific pictures in it

151
00:07:16.745 --> 00:07:19.145
that have specific meaning.

152
00:07:19.145 --> 00:07:22.486
And as soon as I returned home,

153
00:07:22.486 --> 00:07:24.906
I didn't let any time said,

154
00:07:24.906 --> 00:07:29.185
I just start tearing down my old patio.

155
00:07:29.185 --> 00:07:34.185
But then I soon figured out from 9/11 what the reason was.

156
00:07:34.826 --> 00:07:38.826
The whole world had embraced

157
00:07:38.826 --> 00:07:42.926
heartache, bitterness, anger,

158
00:07:42.926 --> 00:07:45.746
terror, everything had changed.

159
00:07:45.746 --> 00:07:49.746
And as you know, the world has changed dramatically

160
00:07:49.746 --> 00:07:53.466
and continues to change virtually every day.

161
00:07:53.466 --> 00:07:57.326
Beauty, love should not be forgotten

162
00:07:57.326 --> 00:08:01.145
because to me, those will always be the keys.

163
00:08:01.145 --> 00:08:03.956
Those are the keys to bring us back to

164
00:08:03.956 --> 00:08:07.044
greater awareness and to greater balance.

165
00:08:07.044 --> 00:08:09.544
<v Voiceover>So do you think it's the chicken or egg then?</v>

166
00:08:09.544 --> 00:08:10.924
When you look around

167
00:08:10.924 --> 00:08:15.481
and a lot of what is perpetuated as artwork or fashion

168
00:08:15.481 --> 00:08:18.662
or beauty is actually

169
00:08:18.662 --> 00:08:20.322
one could argue in the eye of the beholder

170
00:08:20.322 --> 00:08:22.481
to someone it may be beautiful but often,

171
00:08:22.481 --> 00:08:27.481
it is really a symmetrical discordant, drab or whatever,

172
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.357
what does this, is that a reflection of us

173
00:08:32.357 --> 00:08:34.378
or are we responding to it, or?

174
00:08:34.378 --> 00:08:36.777
<v ->Regina, it's a great question.</v>

175
00:08:36.777 --> 00:08:40.837
The answer to any question like that are the results.

176
00:08:40.837 --> 00:08:43.977
If somebody tells you that they walk in beauty

177
00:08:43.977 --> 00:08:45.997
and every place that they step

178
00:08:45.997 --> 00:08:48.225
dug doo doo remains.

179
00:08:48.225 --> 00:08:49.806
They're not really walking in beauty,

180
00:08:49.806 --> 00:08:52.046
they're talking a good story.

181
00:08:52.046 --> 00:08:53.706
So, when somebody says

182
00:08:53.706 --> 00:08:58.346
that they are working in great beauty but

183
00:08:58.346 --> 00:09:00.087
everything come in out of that,

184
00:09:00.087 --> 00:09:03.987
the vibrations when people look is disharmony,

185
00:09:03.987 --> 00:09:06.167
then just by strict definition,

186
00:09:06.167 --> 00:09:07.747
that is really not beautiful.

187
00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:10.847
So yes, it may be relative to a person

188
00:09:10.847 --> 00:09:13.507
but if we're looking at the end results

189
00:09:13.507 --> 00:09:16.747
as some kind of measuring stick.

190
00:09:16.747 --> 00:09:17.767
Over the years,

191
00:09:17.767 --> 00:09:19.907
many people have come into world Research Foundation

192
00:09:19.907 --> 00:09:23.148
telling me they have the greatest things since slice bread,

193
00:09:23.148 --> 00:09:24.888
I have the great philosophy,

194
00:09:24.888 --> 00:09:27.328
I'm in tune with divinity,

195
00:09:27.328 --> 00:09:29.268
I'm in tune with the creator.

196
00:09:29.268 --> 00:09:31.848
And I look at them and they're bouncing off the walls,

197
00:09:31.848 --> 00:09:33.708
they can't look me in the eye,

198
00:09:33.708 --> 00:09:36.528
they're nervous, they're flinching.

199
00:09:36.528 --> 00:09:38.528
I ask myself,

200
00:09:38.528 --> 00:09:40.968
is that the keys to the kingdom?

201
00:09:40.968 --> 00:09:44.388
Is this the secret of life that this person's sharing?

202
00:09:44.388 --> 00:09:48.388
So, the criteria to me is the walk.

203
00:09:48.388 --> 00:09:52.828
Beauty is what is happening to that person.

204
00:09:52.828 --> 00:09:55.288
Are they living a balance life?

205
00:09:55.288 --> 00:09:58.408
Do they feel harmony?

206
00:09:58.408 --> 00:10:00.388
What are they projecting out?

207
00:10:00.388 --> 00:10:02.588
And of course, this brings us into a wider

208
00:10:02.588 --> 00:10:07.228
and probably way of the intent maybe of our sharing today

209
00:10:07.228 --> 00:10:09.308
but too often,

210
00:10:09.308 --> 00:10:12.368
people get involved in particular,

211
00:10:12.368 --> 00:10:15.148
what they will consider a philosophy,

212
00:10:15.148 --> 00:10:19.508
and yet their life becomes tremendously out of balance.

213
00:10:19.508 --> 00:10:21.594
And then they turn around and wonder.

214
00:10:21.594 --> 00:10:24.015
They'll say to me if I meet someone,

215
00:10:24.015 --> 00:10:25.495
"I can't believe it.

216
00:10:25.495 --> 00:10:27.916
"I'm following all these spiritual precepts

217
00:10:27.916 --> 00:10:30.636
"and yet I don't have a pot to piss in

218
00:10:30.636 --> 00:10:32.136
"and I don't have any money,

219
00:10:32.136 --> 00:10:35.558
"and why isn't God supporting me when I'm helping people?"

220
00:10:35.558 --> 00:10:37.458
It's very simple,

221
00:10:37.458 --> 00:10:40.598
they are on their own little tension,

222
00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:44.518
they have cut them self-off from the great streams of energy

223
00:10:44.518 --> 00:10:47.998
that permeate all of existence.

224
00:10:47.998 --> 00:10:51.478
Plato talked about the archetypes,

225
00:10:51.478 --> 00:10:53.618
the ideal state.

226
00:10:53.618 --> 00:10:56.318
This was reiterated over history many times

227
00:10:56.318 --> 00:10:59.858
but probably the greatest practitioner, I believe

228
00:10:59.858 --> 00:11:03.418
was Paracelsus who lived in the late 14,

229
00:11:03.418 --> 00:11:05.018
early 1500's.

230
00:11:05.018 --> 00:11:07.939
He spoke of the great fonts

231
00:11:07.939 --> 00:11:11.102
of energy and love the archetypes

232
00:11:11.102 --> 00:11:14.502
that are continuously available.

233
00:11:14.502 --> 00:11:17.242
When we align ourselves with these,

234
00:11:17.242 --> 00:11:19.782
we are in perfect balance and harmony.

235
00:11:19.782 --> 00:11:23.303
And he believed that a person could live for great

236
00:11:23.303 --> 00:11:25.963
hundreds and hundreds of years of time,

237
00:11:25.963 --> 00:11:28.763
when you are connected to the source,

238
00:11:28.763 --> 00:11:31.123
when you are one with that source

239
00:11:31.123 --> 00:11:32.983
and you have nothing,

240
00:11:32.983 --> 00:11:34.563
no detriment,

241
00:11:34.563 --> 00:11:37.303
no shutting off of that creative flow,

242
00:11:37.303 --> 00:11:39.363
you can go on forever.

243
00:11:39.363 --> 00:11:40.943
What do we do?

244
00:11:40.943 --> 00:11:43.263
We cut ourselves off.

245
00:11:43.263 --> 00:11:45.383
Remember this,

246
00:11:45.383 --> 00:11:48.363
nature never abandons us,

247
00:11:48.363 --> 00:11:50.383
we abandon nature.

248
00:11:50.383 --> 00:11:51.303
<v Voiceover>Very true,</v>

249
00:11:51.303 --> 00:11:53.683
and talk about some other ways in which we cut ourselves off

250
00:11:53.683 --> 00:11:56.823
because I think most people are guilty of one or all.

251
00:11:56.823 --> 00:11:58.163
<v ->Exactly.</v>

252
00:11:58.163 --> 00:12:00.483
And so, when we look at this concept

253
00:12:00.483 --> 00:12:04.363
of aligning ourselves with the beautiful.

254
00:12:04.363 --> 00:12:09.363
And I used this LEFL philosophy to kind of

255
00:12:09.583 --> 00:12:14.103
reintegrate somebody back into the basics of life.

256
00:12:14.103 --> 00:12:18.586
We have over technological ourselves,

257
00:12:18.586 --> 00:12:20.272
we'll say technology--
<v Voiceover>Technological.</v>

258
00:12:20.272 --> 00:12:21.672
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>

259
00:12:21.672 --> 00:12:25.479
Because we think that this makes us more clever.

260
00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:27.339
We think that we're so far advanced

261
00:12:27.339 --> 00:12:29.859
because we have little tools,

262
00:12:29.859 --> 00:12:33.379
but there's perhaps more people unhappy in life.

263
00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:36.799
And so, I can honestly tell you,

264
00:12:36.799 --> 00:12:38.821
I'm 57 years old,

265
00:12:38.821 --> 00:12:43.551
that I have totally enjoyed my life.

266
00:12:43.551 --> 00:12:45.522
A lot of people will claim that

267
00:12:45.522 --> 00:12:49.603
I have a magical life which I feel I do

268
00:12:49.603 --> 00:12:53.703
and I believe the reason is, from great laughter,

269
00:12:53.703 --> 00:12:55.783
excitement, fun

270
00:12:55.783 --> 00:12:59.223
and just loving what life has to offer

271
00:12:59.223 --> 00:13:03.923
not attempting to bend life to fit me

272
00:13:03.923 --> 00:13:07.203
but becoming in resonance with those things that

273
00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:09.143
are around me

274
00:13:09.143 --> 00:13:11.003
and enjoying them.

275
00:13:11.003 --> 00:13:14.283
People talk about the philosophy from the creator, God,

276
00:13:14.283 --> 00:13:17.083
whatever makes people feel comfortable,

277
00:13:17.083 --> 00:13:18.983
to me, it isn't a book

278
00:13:18.983 --> 00:13:22.223
and it's not a scripture, it is nature.

279
00:13:22.223 --> 00:13:25.503
Very few, if you even look at the most hardened criminal

280
00:13:25.503 --> 00:13:27.123
walking the planet,

281
00:13:27.123 --> 00:13:29.423
would go to my local area here,

282
00:13:29.423 --> 00:13:32.424
Bell Rock, or look at the Grand Canyon and go,

283
00:13:32.424 --> 00:13:34.004
"That sucks!"

284
00:13:34.004 --> 00:13:35.404
They just don't do that.

285
00:13:35.404 --> 00:13:36.204
You don't--

286
00:13:36.204 --> 00:13:38.267
<v Voiceover>It's true, you can't say that about this area.</v>

287
00:13:38.267 --> 00:13:39.407
<v ->You just don't say that.</v>

288
00:13:39.407 --> 00:13:40.867
So, even though someone may,

289
00:13:40.867 --> 00:13:43.047
who is a real hardened type

290
00:13:43.047 --> 00:13:45.227
may not go out and go,

291
00:13:45.227 --> 00:13:49.027
be real, "Oh, my gosh, it's so wonderful."

292
00:13:49.027 --> 00:13:50.627
They still would be in odd.

293
00:13:50.627 --> 00:13:51.867
<v Voiceover>There's a resonance.</v>

294
00:13:51.867 --> 00:13:52.807
A recognition.

295
00:13:52.807 --> 00:13:56.867
<v ->Yes, to me, this nature</v>

296
00:13:56.867 --> 00:13:58.947
is the garment of the deity,

297
00:13:58.947 --> 00:14:00.987
the garment of the creator.

298
00:14:00.987 --> 00:14:04.307
And it's available to all of us all the time.

299
00:14:04.307 --> 00:14:05.467
<v Voiceover>So, how do we,</v>

300
00:14:05.467 --> 00:14:07.527
how do we go about cutting ourselves off

301
00:14:07.527 --> 00:14:11.107
from all of these, the LEFL factors?

302
00:14:11.107 --> 00:14:14.667
<v ->The LEFL factor, because we,</v>

303
00:14:14.667 --> 00:14:18.108
we'll use an analogy by Paracelsus.

304
00:14:18.108 --> 00:14:21.368
Paracelsus made this discovery about vibrations

305
00:14:21.368 --> 00:14:23.888
and replenishing the stream

306
00:14:23.888 --> 00:14:27.508
because in his day, I believe it was around 1512,

307
00:14:27.508 --> 00:14:30.748
they came across a man who had locked himself

308
00:14:30.748 --> 00:14:33.408
in a room in his house

309
00:14:33.408 --> 00:14:36.388
and he closed all the windows,

310
00:14:36.388 --> 00:14:37.848
closed all the doors

311
00:14:37.848 --> 00:14:42.848
and apparently was sealed enough that he died.

312
00:14:42.868 --> 00:14:44.828
And when they went in there,

313
00:14:44.828 --> 00:14:47.308
they were trying to figure out, well,

314
00:14:47.308 --> 00:14:48.188
why did he die,

315
00:14:48.188 --> 00:14:49.908
why did he expire?

316
00:14:49.908 --> 00:14:52.505
And Paracelsus observed and understood

317
00:14:52.505 --> 00:14:54.625
that there was a greater symbol here.

318
00:14:54.625 --> 00:14:57.965
When we shut ourselves off,

319
00:14:57.965 --> 00:15:01.505
when we go into dogma,

320
00:15:01.505 --> 00:15:03.325
we constrict.

321
00:15:03.325 --> 00:15:05.485
And how do we get this?

322
00:15:05.485 --> 00:15:08.865
By having close minded attitudes.

323
00:15:08.865 --> 00:15:11.245
By becoming dogmatic,

324
00:15:11.245 --> 00:15:13.005
we close ourselves off

325
00:15:13.005 --> 00:15:15.803
from the tremendous flows

326
00:15:15.803 --> 00:15:18.463
of love, beauty, energy,

327
00:15:18.463 --> 00:15:20.163
even, I'm gonna use the power

328
00:15:20.163 --> 00:15:22.641
but not what people would normally use it.

329
00:15:22.641 --> 00:15:24.961
It is our vitalic energy,

330
00:15:24.961 --> 00:15:29.404
this power, this energy which is with us all the time.

331
00:15:29.404 --> 00:15:30.964
It permeates this planet,

332
00:15:30.964 --> 00:15:33.004
the cosmos, all existence.

333
00:15:33.004 --> 00:15:36.685
We close it off when we dogmatically

334
00:15:36.685 --> 00:15:38.786
go into some activity,

335
00:15:38.786 --> 00:15:41.766
when we shut ourselves off from other people,

336
00:15:41.766 --> 00:15:44.269
when we close our religious belief

337
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:46.989
to not allow anything else,

338
00:15:46.989 --> 00:15:50.769
political, whatever terms you wanna use.

339
00:15:50.769 --> 00:15:54.089
Again, we have abandoned

340
00:15:54.089 --> 00:15:58.589
the fonts of energy, they never abandoned us.

341
00:15:58.589 --> 00:15:59.896
<v Voiceover>And this happens when someone</v>

342
00:15:59.896 --> 00:16:02.496
with the best of intentions is looking for a new,

343
00:16:02.496 --> 00:16:04.196
as you say, philosophy

344
00:16:04.196 --> 00:16:06.596
or maybe a new healing modality

345
00:16:06.596 --> 00:16:10.116
to become involved with or attach to or whatever,

346
00:16:10.116 --> 00:16:11.556
toward whatever end,

347
00:16:11.556 --> 00:16:13.976
but in doing so, these are often

348
00:16:13.976 --> 00:16:16.796
really, almost requiring deprivation

349
00:16:16.796 --> 00:16:18.256
in the way they're going about it.

350
00:16:18.256 --> 00:16:19.736
<v ->You are exactly right</v>

351
00:16:19.736 --> 00:16:23.076
because anything that stifles,

352
00:16:23.076 --> 00:16:26.697
excuse me, that cuts off, that hampers,

353
00:16:26.697 --> 00:16:28.777
immediately stifles those flows.

354
00:16:28.777 --> 00:16:33.297
Now, there is something called righteous indignation.

355
00:16:33.297 --> 00:16:35.277
There is an aspect that says

356
00:16:35.277 --> 00:16:38.138
there are natural laws of the universe

357
00:16:38.138 --> 00:16:41.718
and they are going to fulfill themselves no matter what.

358
00:16:41.718 --> 00:16:44.778
And this is the point I'm trying to make,

359
00:16:44.778 --> 00:16:48.098
you can be somebody helping people

360
00:16:48.098 --> 00:16:49.958
during the worst calamity,

361
00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.658
you can be rescuing people,

362
00:16:51.658 --> 00:16:54.918
working, doing things through the highest of beauty,

363
00:16:54.918 --> 00:16:57.078
the highest spiritual precept,

364
00:16:57.078 --> 00:16:59.118
and then you eat some garbage food

365
00:16:59.118 --> 00:17:01.738
that really isn't good for you, guess what?

366
00:17:01.738 --> 00:17:03.538
You're gonna become ill.

367
00:17:03.538 --> 00:17:06.858
So, even though you were doing an activity

368
00:17:06.858 --> 00:17:08.778
that was spiritual,

369
00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:12.058
you are breaking another law that also exist

370
00:17:12.058 --> 00:17:14.858
and so this brings us into the whole concept

371
00:17:14.858 --> 00:17:18.318
that the Greeks came up with which was,

372
00:17:18.318 --> 00:17:22.858
the one, the good, and the beautiful.

373
00:17:22.858 --> 00:17:25.360
The one which is it's all one,

374
00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:30.360
the good meant that all laws work consistently.

375
00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:34.660
It isn't one morning that you do one activity

376
00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.860
and God says, "Oh, you're a great spiritual being."

377
00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.040
And then you do the same activity the next day

378
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.580
and you get blown out of the water or reprimanded

379
00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.820
or hit by a lightning volt.

380
00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.420
They believe that the world was good.

381
00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.300
Even if that activity ended up bad for somebody,

382
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.120
the Greeks believed it was good because

383
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.100
cause and effect is consistent in this universe,

384
00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.920
and the beauty, the one good beautiful,

385
00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:04.360
the beautiful is line harmony proportion.

386
00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:09.360
So when we follow as closely as possible

387
00:18:09.581 --> 00:18:11.441
natural laws,

388
00:18:11.441 --> 00:18:14.601
we are then in tune with the great,

389
00:18:14.601 --> 00:18:16.901
fonts of energy,

390
00:18:16.901 --> 00:18:21.901
the flows that replenish and bait us in this energy

391
00:18:22.481 --> 00:18:24.411
which keeps us going,

392
00:18:24.411 --> 00:18:25.871
and keeps us healthy,

393
00:18:25.871 --> 00:18:26.931
and keeps us loving,

394
00:18:26.931 --> 00:18:28.611
and keeps us beautiful.

395
00:18:28.611 --> 00:18:31.291
Any listener, anybody who is watching this show,

396
00:18:31.291 --> 00:18:34.931
it doesn't take much imagination for them to realize

397
00:18:34.931 --> 00:18:38.891
what areas they have cut themselves off from.

398
00:18:38.891 --> 00:18:41.451
<v Voiceover>This is very true.</v>

399
00:18:41.451 --> 00:18:43.191
There are couple of ways to go.

400
00:18:43.191 --> 00:18:45.431
I want to ask you about

401
00:18:45.431 --> 00:18:47.532
your perception of something

402
00:18:47.532 --> 00:18:52.531
starting in the 1960's in particular with women.

403
00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:55.691
Things started changing in many levels,

404
00:18:55.691 --> 00:18:58.151
but one of them was fashion.

405
00:18:58.151 --> 00:19:01.828
So now, what the man wore, the woman could wear

406
00:19:01.828 --> 00:19:05.188
and so, this has been perpetuated even to this day.

407
00:19:05.188 --> 00:19:06.508
So, you both go out,

408
00:19:06.508 --> 00:19:08.028
you both have your blank tank on,

409
00:19:08.028 --> 00:19:10.868
you have your cowboy boots and you have your jeans.

410
00:19:10.868 --> 00:19:13.968
What has this done, in your opinion,

411
00:19:13.968 --> 00:19:18.268
to the essence of femininity and the loveliness

412
00:19:18.268 --> 00:19:21.288
of a certain amount of polarization between the sexes?

413
00:19:21.288 --> 00:19:23.528
<v ->Regina, we didn't discuss this before</v>

414
00:19:23.528 --> 00:19:26.408
but I wanna thank you for asking this question

415
00:19:26.408 --> 00:19:30.288
because I have often talked with people about

416
00:19:30.288 --> 00:19:31.328
what I'm gonna share.

417
00:19:31.328 --> 00:19:33.668
And I believe very strongly

418
00:19:33.668 --> 00:19:37.268
the divine feminine of this universe

419
00:19:37.268 --> 00:19:39.808
has created the beauty,

420
00:19:39.808 --> 00:19:44.808
the love, the harmony, not the masculine side.

421
00:19:45.209 --> 00:19:49.028
The great poets, musicians,

422
00:19:49.028 --> 00:19:51.808
philosophers that,

423
00:19:51.808 --> 00:19:53.045
that have brought beauty in the world

424
00:19:53.045 --> 00:19:54.605
whether they are men and women,

425
00:19:54.605 --> 00:19:58.825
it came from the feminine side of the being

426
00:19:58.825 --> 00:20:03.025
not the male masculine side.

427
00:20:03.025 --> 00:20:06.525
And so when we look at intuition,

428
00:20:06.525 --> 00:20:08.825
healing, perception,

429
00:20:08.825 --> 00:20:13.185
that comes from the feminine side of the nature.

430
00:20:13.185 --> 00:20:17.482
And to answer your question for,

431
00:20:17.482 --> 00:20:19.579
for women to abandon

432
00:20:19.579 --> 00:20:23.206
and not understand who they are

433
00:20:24.956 --> 00:20:28.816
is bringing the race down in the opposite direction

434
00:20:28.816 --> 00:20:30.316
that it could be going

435
00:20:30.316 --> 00:20:34.377
because the male does not produce beauty,

436
00:20:34.377 --> 00:20:36.256
the male does not produce art.

437
00:20:36.256 --> 00:20:38.833
And we're talking about the masculine energy,

438
00:20:38.833 --> 00:20:43.213
because of course males do, but it's that feminine side

439
00:20:43.213 --> 00:20:46.453
that does not mean that somebody is effeminate

440
00:20:46.453 --> 00:20:47.873
or that they're gay.

441
00:20:47.873 --> 00:20:51.677
It just means that this is the creative, beautiful side.

442
00:20:53.167 --> 00:20:56.727
Our civilization with its emphasis on sports,

443
00:20:56.727 --> 00:20:58.647
and you know my background,

444
00:20:58.647 --> 00:21:00.427
I have a strong athletic background,

445
00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:02.167
I know all about sports.

446
00:21:02.167 --> 00:21:04.967
But when we have people

447
00:21:04.967 --> 00:21:06.747
pushing their children,

448
00:21:06.747 --> 00:21:11.687
the girls into being the next great golfer

449
00:21:11.687 --> 00:21:16.288
rather than the piano, the violin, music,

450
00:21:16.288 --> 00:21:20.547
the race is not going to its highest and best direction.

451
00:21:20.547 --> 00:21:21.867
And that's the words I used,

452
00:21:21.867 --> 00:21:23.487
there is no right or wrong,

453
00:21:23.487 --> 00:21:25.688
it is, what is the highest and best.

454
00:21:25.688 --> 00:21:28.067
So, this whole concept

455
00:21:28.067 --> 00:21:31.887
where the woman is not appreciated

456
00:21:31.887 --> 00:21:34.787
is a shame, it's a travesty.

457
00:21:34.787 --> 00:21:37.347
But you can go back to Pythagoras

458
00:21:37.347 --> 00:21:40.849
and his academy in Crotone in 550 B.C.

459
00:21:40.849 --> 00:21:43.069
He had an incredible academy

460
00:21:43.069 --> 00:21:44.949
where women were equals

461
00:21:44.949 --> 00:21:47.350
where he knew and they realized

462
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.934
his school was perhaps the only school going back

463
00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:52.934
thousands of years to the present time

464
00:21:52.934 --> 00:21:56.914
where a woman was on the same status with men,

465
00:21:56.914 --> 00:21:59.197
that they were honored and revered.

466
00:21:59.197 --> 00:22:01.117
And the great teacher, Hypatia,

467
00:22:01.117 --> 00:22:05.637
who was the head librarian of the Library of Alexandria

468
00:22:05.637 --> 00:22:08.597
right before it was burned down,

469
00:22:08.597 --> 00:22:12.937
a woman of exquisite beauty and intellect.

470
00:22:12.937 --> 00:22:15.817
And even going into Isabella d'Este

471
00:22:15.817 --> 00:22:19.297
who is my patron for this room,

472
00:22:19.297 --> 00:22:22.317
the grand lady of the Renaissance

473
00:22:22.317 --> 00:22:25.817
who could sing, dance, write poetry,

474
00:22:25.817 --> 00:22:27.917
she was strong when she had to be

475
00:22:27.917 --> 00:22:32.377
but she had all of the beauty exuding from her constantly,

476
00:22:32.377 --> 00:22:34.437
we don't wanna lose that.

477
00:22:34.437 --> 00:22:38.357
And we are losing that with your question.

478
00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:43.017
Fighting for equality should have remained at the equal,

479
00:22:43.017 --> 00:22:45.077
getting equal compensation

480
00:22:45.077 --> 00:22:46.977
and being recognized

481
00:22:46.977 --> 00:22:48.817
but not becoming a man,

482
00:22:48.817 --> 00:22:53.697
because more men need to push the other side

483
00:22:53.697 --> 00:22:56.397
so there's a little bit more gentleness in the world.

484
00:22:56.397 --> 00:22:57.779
<v Voiceover>I couldn't agree more</v>

485
00:22:57.779 --> 00:22:58.639
and there is the--

486
00:22:58.639 --> 00:22:59.659
<v ->And I didn't give you a chance</v>

487
00:22:59.659 --> 00:23:00.862
to even talk during that--

488
00:23:00.862 --> 00:23:02.722
<v Voiceover>No, no, I asked your opinion.</v>

489
00:23:02.722 --> 00:23:07.722
And there is a rise in violence among girls and women,

490
00:23:09.102 --> 00:23:10.142
teenage girls.

491
00:23:10.142 --> 00:23:13.719
and when you see this in the movies, for example,

492
00:23:13.719 --> 00:23:17.683
it's cool to be tough to be able to kick butt,

493
00:23:17.683 --> 00:23:21.185
Laura Croft or something else, it doesn't matter.

494
00:23:21.185 --> 00:23:22.305
<v ->Right.</v>

495
00:23:22.305 --> 00:23:24.285
<v Voiceover>This, would you say,</v>

496
00:23:24.285 --> 00:23:27.149
and I don't wanna get too conspiratorial on this,

497
00:23:27.149 --> 00:23:29.107
is there anything

498
00:23:29.107 --> 00:23:32.227
that's being intentionally orchestrated here or is this,

499
00:23:32.227 --> 00:23:33.967
what this is a reflection of?

500
00:23:33.967 --> 00:23:38.967
<v ->I think it's a reflection of when you go into a pond,</v>

501
00:23:38.967 --> 00:23:41.967
if you look at a pond and the pond has

502
00:23:41.967 --> 00:23:46.687
a flow of freshwater that permeates it,

503
00:23:46.687 --> 00:23:48.307
everything is fresh,

504
00:23:48.307 --> 00:23:49.947
everything is beautiful,

505
00:23:49.947 --> 00:23:51.147
everything grows,

506
00:23:51.147 --> 00:23:52.907
and the water is nice.

507
00:23:52.907 --> 00:23:56.367
When the pond is cut off from inflows,

508
00:23:56.367 --> 00:23:58.807
it begins to stagnate,

509
00:23:58.807 --> 00:24:01.807
putrefy, stink.

510
00:24:01.807 --> 00:24:03.127
What have we done here?

511
00:24:03.127 --> 00:24:05.807
No, I don't necessarily think it's a conspiracy.

512
00:24:05.807 --> 00:24:10.687
I believe that the culture has managed to close itself off

513
00:24:10.687 --> 00:24:12.507
because of its tastes.

514
00:24:12.507 --> 00:24:16.827
It tends to have changed its entire taste and belief

515
00:24:16.827 --> 00:24:18.807
of what is important.

516
00:24:18.807 --> 00:24:21.687
And that when a race started doing that,

517
00:24:21.687 --> 00:24:22.987
when they're competing,

518
00:24:22.987 --> 00:24:26.547
they're competitive for financial resources

519
00:24:26.547 --> 00:24:28.607
to have what the other person has,

520
00:24:28.607 --> 00:24:32.187
to be like the other person, that is the problem.

521
00:24:32.187 --> 00:24:36.407
So, we might say, if there's a conspiracy,

522
00:24:36.407 --> 00:24:39.707
I don't feel this much as I feel a close mindedness

523
00:24:39.707 --> 00:24:43.907
that people tend to get closed in a box

524
00:24:43.907 --> 00:24:46.067
and then that box is fed by the people

525
00:24:46.067 --> 00:24:47.867
who have the authority thinking,

526
00:24:47.867 --> 00:24:48.887
well, this is what they want

527
00:24:48.887 --> 00:24:50.847
so let's keep giving it to them.

528
00:24:50.847 --> 00:24:53.709
So if we're the media, let's just keep feeding it.

529
00:24:53.709 --> 00:24:55.049
This is what they want,

530
00:24:55.049 --> 00:24:56.689
so let's feed it to them

531
00:24:56.689 --> 00:25:00.849
until somebody decides to change it.

532
00:25:00.849 --> 00:25:04.209
Until Jonathan Livingston Seagull decides to do that

533
00:25:04.209 --> 00:25:08.129
right turn at high speed and change

534
00:25:08.129 --> 00:25:10.469
but this is why we have great philosophers

535
00:25:10.469 --> 00:25:12.649
throughout the ages

536
00:25:12.649 --> 00:25:17.649
who constantly restate universal truth.

537
00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:21.809
So, no, I am not convinced that there's a conspiracy

538
00:25:21.809 --> 00:25:24.169
because of my philosophy of life.

539
00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:27.759
I believe life is a school room,

540
00:25:27.759 --> 00:25:31.529
and in that school room, you have various grades.

541
00:25:31.529 --> 00:25:33.209
Let's take an elementary school,

542
00:25:33.209 --> 00:25:36.009
first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth.

543
00:25:36.009 --> 00:25:37.969
It's great.

544
00:25:37.969 --> 00:25:40.669
And I believe when people graduate,

545
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:42.749
because they have greater awareness,

546
00:25:42.749 --> 00:25:47.029
they go on to another school room in the cosmos.

547
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:49.049
My analogy means this,

548
00:25:49.049 --> 00:25:51.849
you never look at an elementary school and say,

549
00:25:51.849 --> 00:25:55.069
it should be a university, it's not.

550
00:25:55.069 --> 00:25:59.369
And the people who have the great awareness,

551
00:25:59.369 --> 00:26:00.869
they go on, they graduate,

552
00:26:00.869 --> 00:26:02.589
they don't stay around forever.

553
00:26:02.589 --> 00:26:05.409
And you have knew little kids who come into school

554
00:26:05.409 --> 00:26:07.410
pulling the pigtails at the girls

555
00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:09.010
and defacing the walls,

556
00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:11.270
and not paying attention,

557
00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.510
and then they will evolve.

558
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:16.170
And they will expand and they will grow,

559
00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:17.550
and they will graduate

560
00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:20.790
and there are constantly new classes that come in.

561
00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:24.341
I am not one of these people who believe that overnight,

562
00:26:25.771 --> 00:26:29.231
the whole cosmos changes with the indigo children.

563
00:26:29.231 --> 00:26:31.031
I may be bucking the thigh at here,

564
00:26:31.031 --> 00:26:33.851
but I'm sorry, the universe doesn't work like that.

565
00:26:33.851 --> 00:26:36.791
It doesn't instantaneously award people

566
00:26:36.791 --> 00:26:39.151
because of the time element.

567
00:26:39.151 --> 00:26:41.051
It is a growth,

568
00:26:41.051 --> 00:26:43.032
it is an expansion,

569
00:26:43.032 --> 00:26:45.192
it is us becoming

570
00:26:45.192 --> 00:26:47.204
and understanding that we are gods.

571
00:26:48.214 --> 00:26:51.114
And we must learn and demonstrate

572
00:26:51.114 --> 00:26:54.654
our ability to manage creative energy.

573
00:26:54.654 --> 00:26:57.394
It all boils down to this,

574
00:26:57.394 --> 00:27:00.394
we are not in the likeness of the creator or God

575
00:27:00.394 --> 00:27:02.735
in our physical appearance,

576
00:27:02.735 --> 00:27:05.435
but in the ability to create.

577
00:27:05.435 --> 00:27:07.495
And this is a school room

578
00:27:07.495 --> 00:27:11.015
where we learn about creativity.

579
00:27:11.015 --> 00:27:12.955
<v Voiceover>In fact, Jean Shinoda Bolen</v>

580
00:27:12.955 --> 00:27:15.495
who is also on our side

581
00:27:15.495 --> 00:27:18.275
has written a book, I think it's called

582
00:27:18.275 --> 00:27:21.673
the Goddesses in Every Woman and Gods in Every Man.

583
00:27:21.673 --> 00:27:24.213
And I think it's addressing this type of

584
00:27:24.213 --> 00:27:28.872
constant to classical archetypal information

585
00:27:28.872 --> 00:27:30.533
to begin reconnecting with it

586
00:27:30.533 --> 00:27:32.712
because we have become so fractured.

587
00:27:34.931 --> 00:27:38.410
<v ->I think that is the direction we must go but, again,</v>

588
00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:43.410
this is where I interject my very inexpensive LEFL therapy.

589
00:27:43.471 --> 00:27:45.628
Yeah, laughter, excitement,

590
00:27:45.628 --> 00:27:46.688
fun and love

591
00:27:46.688 --> 00:27:48.209
and you don't have to pay a lot of money

592
00:27:48.209 --> 00:27:49.549
and deep counseling

593
00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:52.009
because there's two schools of thought.

594
00:27:52.009 --> 00:27:54.269
I tend to follow the school that

595
00:27:54.269 --> 00:27:55.347
you don't muck around

596
00:27:55.347 --> 00:27:57.225
and keep scratching it something endlessly

597
00:27:57.225 --> 00:27:59.125
until it gets all infected

598
00:27:59.125 --> 00:28:01.965
and you don't have to muck around in these problems,

599
00:28:01.965 --> 00:28:04.884
amd these vibrations since somebody has had in the past

600
00:28:04.884 --> 00:28:07.605
because that isn't necessarily

601
00:28:07.605 --> 00:28:09.345
going to lead them to anything

602
00:28:09.345 --> 00:28:12.265
but putting them right back in that vibration.

603
00:28:12.265 --> 00:28:13.504
It is a vibration.

604
00:28:13.504 --> 00:28:15.084
Even in healing.

605
00:28:15.084 --> 00:28:19.584
The personal healing work that I do, that I'm involved in,

606
00:28:19.584 --> 00:28:24.584
I never look at what the person's difficulty is.

607
00:28:24.884 --> 00:28:29.884
I only seek to see that person in perfection.

608
00:28:31.202 --> 00:28:32.143
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about that</v>

609
00:28:32.143 --> 00:28:34.043
and talk about your healing a bit.

610
00:28:34.043 --> 00:28:36.802
<v ->Well, I speak a little bit about it but not too much</v>

611
00:28:36.802 --> 00:28:38.082
other than to say

612
00:28:38.082 --> 00:28:41.942
we've been involved with it for 35 years

613
00:28:41.942 --> 00:28:46.800
with people who've had a multitude of health problems

614
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.441
that are, the severest that there is,

615
00:28:49.441 --> 00:28:52.011
whether they are cancer and

616
00:28:52.011 --> 00:28:55.658
tumors and inoperable problems.

617
00:28:55.658 --> 00:28:57.577
What we have found is

618
00:28:57.577 --> 00:29:00.097
that you do not have to change your name,

619
00:29:00.097 --> 00:29:03.357
you do not have to have a degree,

620
00:29:03.357 --> 00:29:06.718
you just must have a desire

621
00:29:06.718 --> 00:29:10.197
and an intent to help another person.

622
00:29:10.197 --> 00:29:12.738
And we have demonstrated this, although,

623
00:29:12.738 --> 00:29:15.083
again, this is not the intent but you've asked,

624
00:29:15.083 --> 00:29:18.763
but my sharing in this area is to try to

625
00:29:18.763 --> 00:29:22.523
allow people to understand that all things are possible.

626
00:29:22.523 --> 00:29:25.783
Now, I have been blessed with parchments and scrolls

627
00:29:25.783 --> 00:29:29.263
and old book that I've studied for

628
00:29:29.263 --> 00:29:32.063
basically my entire adult life.

629
00:29:32.063 --> 00:29:34.603
And what I have learned is that there,

630
00:29:34.603 --> 00:29:37.824
again, is a multitude of approaches

631
00:29:37.824 --> 00:29:40.304
but the biggest key is love.

632
00:29:40.304 --> 00:29:43.404
And when you have love for another person,

633
00:29:43.404 --> 00:29:45.344
and you have that desire,

634
00:29:45.344 --> 00:29:49.104
that vibratory rate is so profound

635
00:29:49.104 --> 00:29:52.344
that it sweeps over a person,

636
00:29:52.344 --> 00:29:53.925
I'm not gonna say like a tsunami,

637
00:29:53.925 --> 00:29:56.785
I'm gonna say like a gentle loving breeze.

638
00:29:56.785 --> 00:30:00.245
And when a person feels that you love them,

639
00:30:00.245 --> 00:30:03.625
instantaneous healings have occurred.

640
00:30:03.625 --> 00:30:06.005
So, I will tell you that we have worked with people

641
00:30:06.005 --> 00:30:08.685
with inoperable brain cancer tumors,

642
00:30:08.685 --> 00:30:10.265
breast cancer tumors,

643
00:30:10.265 --> 00:30:12.265
people in comas,

644
00:30:12.265 --> 00:30:14.645
and they have had spontaneous remissions.

645
00:30:14.645 --> 00:30:16.885
But I'm not soliciting to people,

646
00:30:16.885 --> 00:30:20.565
I'm trying to empower you and the audience

647
00:30:20.565 --> 00:30:22.245
who we are,

648
00:30:22.245 --> 00:30:23.805
who we can be

649
00:30:23.805 --> 00:30:25.905
but not to go to some weekend course

650
00:30:25.905 --> 00:30:28.385
for a hundreds and thousands of dollars.

651
00:30:28.385 --> 00:30:30.325
I believe in our simple approach,

652
00:30:30.325 --> 00:30:32.645
you can laugh all your way to success.

653
00:30:32.645 --> 00:30:35.185
You can laugh all your way to great beauty,

654
00:30:35.185 --> 00:30:36.987
resources and healing.

655
00:30:36.987 --> 00:30:38.487
(chuckling)

656
00:30:38.487 --> 00:30:40.267
<v Voiceover>Well, yes, clearly</v>

657
00:30:40.267 --> 00:30:43.767
you have a strong history in all of these areas

658
00:30:43.767 --> 00:30:45.928
and I wouldn't doubt for one moment.

659
00:30:45.928 --> 00:30:47.548
I like the LEFL,

660
00:30:47.548 --> 00:30:48.748
I like the LEFL formula.

661
00:30:48.748 --> 00:30:51.688
<v ->Yes, it's very easy and quick and it's another,</v>

662
00:30:51.688 --> 00:30:53.008
it's another four-letter word

663
00:30:53.008 --> 00:30:55.128
to put out another vibration.

664
00:30:55.128 --> 00:30:56.588
When we talk about vibrations,

665
00:30:56.588 --> 00:30:59.588
there is nothing more powerful

666
00:30:59.588 --> 00:31:01.428
and important in the universe.

667
00:31:01.428 --> 00:31:03.148
Everything is vibratory,

668
00:31:03.148 --> 00:31:05.769
everything is bipolar in our existence

669
00:31:05.769 --> 00:31:07.629
but the vibration is everything.

670
00:31:07.629 --> 00:31:10.185
And when we were talking about the healing,

671
00:31:10.185 --> 00:31:12.242
again, there is a school that

672
00:31:12.242 --> 00:31:15.602
if you are thinking about that person's tumor

673
00:31:15.602 --> 00:31:18.002
or that person with a problem,

674
00:31:18.002 --> 00:31:20.642
you are reinforcing that whole aspect

675
00:31:20.642 --> 00:31:24.582
but, if you can conceive of this,

676
00:31:24.582 --> 00:31:27.562
if a person can place themselves

677
00:31:27.562 --> 00:31:30.123
in the following state

678
00:31:30.123 --> 00:31:33.323
where they can imagine a person

679
00:31:33.323 --> 00:31:35.762
in complete perfection

680
00:31:35.762 --> 00:31:39.389
at the time they were sparked into existence--

681
00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:41.740
<v Voiceover>That's the key.</v>

682
00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:42.840
<v ->That is the key.</v>

683
00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.359
The archetypal, Regina.

684
00:31:46.359 --> 00:31:50.840
The archetypal perfect person.

685
00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.519
Not now,

686
00:31:52.519 --> 00:31:56.179
not thinking of anything at this time,

687
00:31:56.179 --> 00:31:59.679
but at that perfected moment,

688
00:31:59.679 --> 00:32:02.439
that spontaneous spark,

689
00:32:02.439 --> 00:32:05.119
when that the spirit soul,

690
00:32:05.119 --> 00:32:09.454
whatever terms someone's used will spark into

691
00:32:09.454 --> 00:32:11.206
perfected state.

692
00:32:12.016 --> 00:32:14.736
Now, I'm making something very simplistic,

693
00:32:14.736 --> 00:32:16.659
that some may think is difficult but I want it to be--

694
00:32:16.659 --> 00:32:17.641
<v Voiceover>It's very profound.</v>

695
00:32:17.641 --> 00:32:21.561
<v ->Well, hopefully, it'll get people thinking that</v>

696
00:32:21.561 --> 00:32:24.301
that is just another approach.

697
00:32:24.301 --> 00:32:27.161
All approaches has seem to work from

698
00:32:27.161 --> 00:32:28.681
a multitude of activities.

699
00:32:28.681 --> 00:32:33.241
Now, there is a book that is not considered a sacred text

700
00:32:33.241 --> 00:32:35.621
but it is a very interesting book called

701
00:32:35.621 --> 00:32:39.561
The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ,

702
00:32:39.561 --> 00:32:42.961
written by a man named Levi in the 1800's.

703
00:32:42.961 --> 00:32:44.941
I'm only mentioning it because

704
00:32:44.941 --> 00:32:47.901
it has a very interesting section in it

705
00:32:47.901 --> 00:32:52.341
talking about the time of Jesus and purporting

706
00:32:52.341 --> 00:32:54.081
some of his activities.

707
00:32:54.081 --> 00:32:57.142
But let's look at a story that's in there

708
00:32:57.142 --> 00:33:01.422
which talks about a fellow who was a drunk in the town.

709
00:33:01.422 --> 00:33:03.282
And he was so drunk

710
00:33:03.282 --> 00:33:05.482
and spent so much money on his drinking

711
00:33:05.482 --> 00:33:09.082
that he didn't really cloth and feed his family.

712
00:33:09.082 --> 00:33:10.782
But he really didn't see it

713
00:33:10.782 --> 00:33:13.502
because he was in drunken stupor all the time

714
00:33:13.502 --> 00:33:18.502
and he just forgot about his family members.

715
00:33:18.982 --> 00:33:22.742
Well, there was a big fire in the town

716
00:33:22.742 --> 00:33:25.802
and many people lost their homes

717
00:33:25.802 --> 00:33:29.142
and Jesus came to this man.

718
00:33:29.142 --> 00:33:31.242
Now Jesus had been asked about,

719
00:33:31.242 --> 00:33:33.322
can you help this man?

720
00:33:33.322 --> 00:33:36.122
And he hadn't done anything before this time.

721
00:33:36.122 --> 00:33:38.922
But now a fire had decimated the place,

722
00:33:38.922 --> 00:33:40.262
he was a carpenter,

723
00:33:40.262 --> 00:33:42.202
this man was a carpenter,

724
00:33:42.202 --> 00:33:43.562
and he said to the man,

725
00:33:43.562 --> 00:33:46.002
"Brother, can you come with me?"

726
00:33:46.002 --> 00:33:49.003
So, they walked out and saw some of the burnt houses

727
00:33:49.003 --> 00:33:53.403
and he said, "We're both carpenters,

728
00:33:53.403 --> 00:33:55.083
"let's get to work."

729
00:33:55.083 --> 00:33:58.543
So, they rolled up their sleeves and they started working.

730
00:33:58.543 --> 00:34:01.523
And long behold after day of work,

731
00:34:01.523 --> 00:34:04.063
the man returned to his home

732
00:34:04.063 --> 00:34:07.963
and he saw his wife and kids and the hovel

733
00:34:07.963 --> 00:34:09.983
that his home had become.

734
00:34:09.983 --> 00:34:13.683
And with great feeling, he made a vow at that moment.

735
00:34:13.683 --> 00:34:16.363
What is the purpose of my story?

736
00:34:16.363 --> 00:34:20.644
At no time, did anybody attacked his drinking.

737
00:34:20.644 --> 00:34:23.984
At no time, was it brought up that he should stop.

738
00:34:23.984 --> 00:34:26.584
But, it was supplemented with another activity

739
00:34:26.584 --> 00:34:29.644
that allowed him to come to his senses.

740
00:34:29.644 --> 00:34:32.345
And it reminds me of a story I'm being told to share.

741
00:34:32.345 --> 00:34:35.290
I'm only laughing because of the way it popped into my mind

742
00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:39.070
talking about our own viewpoints.

743
00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:41.310
The story goes that Aristotle was walking

744
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:44.610
on the banks of the Mediterranean

745
00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:47.810
and he was looking at the universe.

746
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:51.210
And he looked in the distance and he saw a figure running

747
00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:54.930
from the water to the shore.

748
00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:57.230
And as he got closer, the man had a bucket

749
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:59.830
and he was dipping the bucket in the Mediterranean

750
00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:02.501
going over and pouring the water into a hole.

751
00:35:03.791 --> 00:35:05.571
And when he got up to the man,

752
00:35:05.571 --> 00:35:09.631
he realized that it was the village mad man and he goes,

753
00:35:09.631 --> 00:35:11.071
what are you doing?

754
00:35:11.071 --> 00:35:11.931
And the man said,

755
00:35:11.931 --> 00:35:15.671
"Well, I'm going to empty all of this water

756
00:35:15.671 --> 00:35:19.802
"out of here, so I can see that blue green bottom."

757
00:35:20.852 --> 00:35:23.152
So, Aristotle looks into him and says,

758
00:35:23.152 --> 00:35:25.032
"How are you gonna get

759
00:35:25.032 --> 00:35:28.352
"all of that water into that little hole?"

760
00:35:28.352 --> 00:35:30.312
And the man scratched his head,

761
00:35:30.312 --> 00:35:31.612
he thought a second, he says,

762
00:35:31.612 --> 00:35:35.232
"Great philosopher, what are you doing today?"

763
00:35:35.232 --> 00:35:37.452
Aristotle says,

764
00:35:37.452 --> 00:35:39.692
"I'm contemplating the universe."

765
00:35:39.692 --> 00:35:41.712
And the man says, "How are you gonna get all of that

766
00:35:41.712 --> 00:35:43.094
"in that little head of yours?"

767
00:35:43.094 --> 00:35:46.734
(laughing)

768
00:35:46.734 --> 00:35:47.994
Everything is relative.

769
00:35:47.994 --> 00:35:49.854
<v Voiceover>Everything is relative.</v>

770
00:35:49.854 --> 00:35:51.234
<v ->Everything is relative.</v>

771
00:35:51.234 --> 00:35:53.154
Everybody asked their,

772
00:35:53.154 --> 00:35:55.174
I didn't make it up and I'm sorry

773
00:35:55.174 --> 00:35:57.774
because I'd read it years and years ago

774
00:35:57.774 --> 00:35:59.054
in somebody's book

775
00:35:59.054 --> 00:36:01.954
so I certainly have not taken credit but it's great story.

776
00:36:01.954 --> 00:36:03.074
<v Voiceover>It's a great story.</v>

777
00:36:03.074 --> 00:36:05.855
And speaking, let's talk about kids for a minute, okay?

778
00:36:05.855 --> 00:36:08.455
Because I think a lot of this starts getting down and down--

779
00:36:08.455 --> 00:36:09.355
<v ->Because I'm childish,</v>

780
00:36:09.355 --> 00:36:10.738
is this why you've brought this up or?

781
00:36:10.738 --> 00:36:11.762
<v Voiceover>I didn't wanna say that but--</v>

782
00:36:11.762 --> 00:36:13.153
(laughing)

783
00:36:15.283 --> 00:36:16.783
A lot of these happens in you,

784
00:36:16.783 --> 00:36:18.523
so by the time we reach adulthood,

785
00:36:18.523 --> 00:36:20.384
we're already pretty much stamped out

786
00:36:20.384 --> 00:36:22.764
on the LEFLameter

787
00:36:23.784 --> 00:36:27.685
<v ->Yes, but this is the great admonition of a</v>

788
00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:30.585
tremendous healer and creator,

789
00:36:30.585 --> 00:36:32.965
and prophet in the western world,

790
00:36:32.965 --> 00:36:36.325
you must become as a child.

791
00:36:36.325 --> 00:36:37.405
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

792
00:36:37.405 --> 00:36:40.065
So, as a child,

793
00:36:40.065 --> 00:36:43.925
one of the things that seems to happen a lot with children

794
00:36:43.925 --> 00:36:46.985
and I think this is worldwide, it's not culture specific

795
00:36:46.985 --> 00:36:47.785
<v ->Right.</v>

796
00:36:47.785 --> 00:36:48.865
<v Voiceover>A child is having</v>

797
00:36:48.865 --> 00:36:51.005
their wonderful flights of fancy,

798
00:36:51.005 --> 00:36:54.405
or not, they may be simply open into experiencing things

799
00:36:54.405 --> 00:36:57.525
that we are no longer capable of seeing and experiencing

800
00:36:57.525 --> 00:36:59.445
and I'm gonna go with that and a lot of it.

801
00:36:59.445 --> 00:37:01.625
So they are experiencing this world,

802
00:37:01.625 --> 00:37:03.606
and whether it's imaginary

803
00:37:03.606 --> 00:37:04.686
and they have their friends,

804
00:37:04.686 --> 00:37:06.106
and they have their stories,

805
00:37:06.106 --> 00:37:07.026
they're excited,

806
00:37:07.026 --> 00:37:07.986
they're enthused,

807
00:37:07.986 --> 00:37:08.926
they're laughing,

808
00:37:08.926 --> 00:37:11.266
they've got a high level factor happening

809
00:37:11.266 --> 00:37:12.247
and then the parents--

810
00:37:12.247 --> 00:37:14.272
<v ->They must be Aquariuses.</v>

811
00:37:14.272 --> 00:37:16.114
It's my birth sign, but yes, go ahead.

812
00:37:16.114 --> 00:37:18.637
<v Voiceover>And the parents come and go splat.</v>

813
00:37:18.637 --> 00:37:20.897
Oh, you,

814
00:37:20.897 --> 00:37:22.757
you're just making that up

815
00:37:22.757 --> 00:37:24.477
and this kind of thing.

816
00:37:24.477 --> 00:37:27.498
So, can we talk about the spirit from the child--

817
00:37:27.498 --> 00:37:29.238
<v ->Well, you see in the,</v>

818
00:37:29.238 --> 00:37:31.179
at the not too distant past

819
00:37:31.179 --> 00:37:35.379
before the advent of television,

820
00:37:35.379 --> 00:37:38.159
imagination was very highly priced

821
00:37:38.159 --> 00:37:41.799
because the old radio programs were radio

822
00:37:41.799 --> 00:37:43.920
and you had it created in your mind.

823
00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:47.640
And so, you didn't have people going and condemning

824
00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.480
or putting down other people because

825
00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:54.300
imagination was something that was very important.

826
00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:57.300
This is another example of this closed box,

827
00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:58.340
not a conspiracy

828
00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:01.100
but just how we have taken our creativity

829
00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.060
down a blind alley

830
00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.820
but, that's why we're in school.

831
00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.280
If we were so wise,

832
00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.880
and we had angel's wings,

833
00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.600
we wouldn't be down here.

834
00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.200
We are down here to learn.

835
00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.440
We are to learn that when we close things up,

836
00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:15.760
when we take the children

837
00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.400
and stop the imagination, that--

838
00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.102
<v Voiceover>When they cut out our programs from school.</v>

839
00:38:20.102 --> 00:38:24.505
<v ->Yes, and again, chasing after to be the best golfer,</v>

840
00:38:24.505 --> 00:38:26.265
the best tennis player,

841
00:38:26.265 --> 00:38:28.885
the best jock, whether it's woman or male

842
00:38:28.885 --> 00:38:30.485
as opposed to the art.

843
00:38:30.485 --> 00:38:32.665
My mom,

844
00:38:32.665 --> 00:38:36.726
before I built this room, was telling about how in New York,

845
00:38:36.726 --> 00:38:39.186
her uncles all played musical instruments

846
00:38:39.186 --> 00:38:41.626
and it wasn't unusual that once a week,

847
00:38:41.626 --> 00:38:43.866
usually Saturday, Sunday night,

848
00:38:43.866 --> 00:38:46.426
they all got together and played music,

849
00:38:46.426 --> 00:38:47.646
they played instruments.

850
00:38:47.646 --> 00:38:49.886
This was before television.

851
00:38:49.886 --> 00:38:54.326
This was right at the early days of the radio

852
00:38:54.326 --> 00:38:56.426
and so what has happened is

853
00:38:56.426 --> 00:39:00.266
we have created a culture that relies on

854
00:39:00.266 --> 00:39:05.106
an outside venue to entertain us

855
00:39:05.106 --> 00:39:07.846
and then anything that we get internally

856
00:39:07.846 --> 00:39:10.506
is discounted as either not relevant

857
00:39:10.506 --> 00:39:13.246
or we're not smart enough.

858
00:39:13.246 --> 00:39:16.746
Now, this brings up another point about

859
00:39:16.746 --> 00:39:20.186
what the ancients thought about imagination.

860
00:39:20.186 --> 00:39:25.046
Imagination is the most important gift

861
00:39:25.046 --> 00:39:28.857
that the creator or God has given to us.

862
00:39:30.227 --> 00:39:34.327
That is one of the magical keys for all

863
00:39:34.327 --> 00:39:36.467
work on this plan.

864
00:39:36.467 --> 00:39:37.487
<v Voiceover>This room,</v>

865
00:39:37.487 --> 00:39:38.627
your imagination.

866
00:39:38.627 --> 00:39:40.067
<v ->It is because</v>

867
00:39:40.067 --> 00:39:43.847
what the ancients called fantasy

868
00:39:43.847 --> 00:39:47.987
was the made up things that were either silly

869
00:39:47.987 --> 00:39:51.427
or didn't make any sense or with somebody's

870
00:39:51.427 --> 00:39:54.510
just random idle chatter

871
00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:58.070
but imagination was highly priced.

872
00:39:58.070 --> 00:39:59.770
Paracelsus said,

873
00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:04.030
"The three keys for all manifestation on this earth plan."

874
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:06.990
The magical keys that the prophets,

875
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:11.050
that the apostles used, three things:

876
00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:15.021
imagination, faith, and will.

877
00:40:16.411 --> 00:40:18.411
And I have those written in the World Research

878
00:40:18.411 --> 00:40:20.051
when everybody gets there

879
00:40:20.051 --> 00:40:23.091
because first, you must be able to imagine it.

880
00:40:23.091 --> 00:40:28.091
You must have the total understanding that it will happen.

881
00:40:28.391 --> 00:40:31.451
Not believe, but you know it will happen

882
00:40:31.451 --> 00:40:36.331
and the will to continue on until you see it manifest.

883
00:40:36.331 --> 00:40:39.411
And this is why the admonition of the great

884
00:40:39.411 --> 00:40:41.631
healer 2,000 years ago

885
00:40:41.631 --> 00:40:44.391
was He gave thanks before it happened.

886
00:40:44.391 --> 00:40:46.451
Before He rose Lazarus,

887
00:40:46.451 --> 00:40:48.555
He gave thanks that it was done.

888
00:40:48.555 --> 00:40:52.355
People discount the keys

889
00:40:52.355 --> 00:40:55.395
and they're losing valuable gifts that are given to us

890
00:40:55.395 --> 00:40:59.635
that are the answers to some of our situations.

891
00:40:59.635 --> 00:41:03.295
Acknowledging that it is already done,

892
00:41:03.295 --> 00:41:04.426
it's done.

893
00:41:05.616 --> 00:41:08.376
And people just don't understand that.

894
00:41:08.376 --> 00:41:12.536
So, when you must first imagine what you wish to achieve,

895
00:41:12.536 --> 00:41:15.236
the knowledge that it is done,

896
00:41:15.236 --> 00:41:18.316
you just have not seen it in material form.

897
00:41:18.316 --> 00:41:19.776
It has been handed down

898
00:41:19.776 --> 00:41:21.616
and I'm a librarian so I can tell you

899
00:41:21.616 --> 00:41:24.576
it's been restated and restated and restated

900
00:41:24.576 --> 00:41:27.276
thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

901
00:41:27.276 --> 00:41:30.636
I'm not taking anything away from our modern writers,

902
00:41:30.636 --> 00:41:32.016
but it's not new.

903
00:41:32.016 --> 00:41:33.037
Every time somebody comes out,

904
00:41:33.037 --> 00:41:34.797
I kinda laugh a little bit

905
00:41:34.797 --> 00:41:36.197
because it's like,

906
00:41:36.197 --> 00:41:38.126
"Oh, they've got the greatest things and slice bread--

907
00:41:38.126 --> 00:41:39.147
<v Voiceover>Were you one of the few people</v>

908
00:41:39.147 --> 00:41:41.747
that has a frame of reference for that

909
00:41:41.747 --> 00:41:43.927
being a modest librarian?

910
00:41:43.927 --> 00:41:46.787
<v ->A modest, a quite librarian who</v>

911
00:41:46.787 --> 00:41:48.807
who sees this over and over.

912
00:41:48.807 --> 00:41:52.087
It reminds me to interject to story that

913
00:41:52.087 --> 00:41:56.407
I flew, not I, but World Research flew Bjorn,

914
00:41:56.407 --> 00:42:00.249
Doctor Bjorn Nordenstrom from Sweden

915
00:42:00.249 --> 00:42:03.469
in 1986 to the United States

916
00:42:03.469 --> 00:42:05.589
for one of our World Congresses.

917
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:07.609
Now, Doctor Nordenstrom

918
00:42:07.609 --> 00:42:11.089
was the past chairman of the Noble Assembly,

919
00:42:11.089 --> 00:42:12.809
Nobel Laureates in Medicine,

920
00:42:12.809 --> 00:42:14.992
discovery of needle biopsy.

921
00:42:14.992 --> 00:42:18.112
He was in the cover of Discover magazine,

922
00:42:18.112 --> 00:42:21.912
he's made the biomedical discovery of the century.

923
00:42:21.912 --> 00:42:25.232
The inside the body is an electrical universe

924
00:42:25.232 --> 00:42:28.272
that turns on and off during the healing process,

925
00:42:28.272 --> 00:42:29.652
during sickness

926
00:42:29.652 --> 00:42:33.652
His system shrinking female breast cancer tumors

927
00:42:33.652 --> 00:42:35.852
was phenomenal.

928
00:42:35.852 --> 00:42:37.573
When I brought him out the news program,

929
00:42:37.573 --> 00:42:40.213
2020 interviewed him.

930
00:42:40.213 --> 00:42:42.314
Hospitals were asking for him to talk,

931
00:42:42.314 --> 00:42:43.934
he was in great demand.

932
00:42:43.934 --> 00:42:45.654
Well,

933
00:42:45.654 --> 00:42:48.674
he made a presentation of his book to us

934
00:42:48.674 --> 00:42:50.174
at World Research.

935
00:42:50.174 --> 00:42:52.934
And we made a very pomp ceremony,

936
00:42:52.934 --> 00:42:56.796
the signed book went on the shelf in electricity.

937
00:42:56.796 --> 00:42:59.476
We placed the book in.

938
00:42:59.476 --> 00:43:03.036
And right next to it was this little tiny book called

939
00:43:03.036 --> 00:43:06.796
The Application of Electricity as a Therapeutic Agent.

940
00:43:06.796 --> 00:43:09.116
Nordenstrom pulls it out,

941
00:43:09.116 --> 00:43:10.696
opens it up,

942
00:43:10.696 --> 00:43:12.336
it says cancer.

943
00:43:12.336 --> 00:43:15.936
In that book, a doctor shrank

944
00:43:15.936 --> 00:43:20.936
a woman's breast cancer tumor in 1877.

945
00:43:22.737 --> 00:43:24.537
<v Voiceover>That was humbling.</v>

946
00:43:24.537 --> 00:43:25.997
<v ->That was very humbling.</v>

947
00:43:25.997 --> 00:43:28.637
So we keep reinventing the wheel.

948
00:43:28.637 --> 00:43:30.157
<v Voiceover>It's all of there for us already.</v>

949
00:43:30.157 --> 00:43:31.097
<v ->Always there.</v>

950
00:43:31.097 --> 00:43:34.659
You and I spoke a little before when we said,

951
00:43:34.659 --> 00:43:37.039
my commentary on a lot of these groups

952
00:43:37.039 --> 00:43:39.019
raising constant money

953
00:43:39.019 --> 00:43:41.319
for cancer, for this, for that

954
00:43:41.319 --> 00:43:43.619
for half of dozen thing,

955
00:43:43.619 --> 00:43:46.399
the answer is right around the corner.

956
00:43:46.399 --> 00:43:48.310
We already have the answers.

957
00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:52.620
The answers have been with us a very, very long time.

958
00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:55.440
It is where we chose to search.

959
00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:58.740
If I was to drop you on an unknown continent

960
00:43:58.740 --> 00:43:59.780
and said to you,

961
00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:04.540
Regina, I want you to examine this whole continent,

962
00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:07.420
but you can only go south.

963
00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:11.120
You can only find a pharmaceutical answer.

964
00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:14.700
You can only find a this answer.

965
00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:16.260
You would never know what's there.

966
00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:17.120
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

967
00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.580
<v ->And so,</v>

968
00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:23.340
all of this is getting back to what your question was.

969
00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:26.360
We have locked ourselves in boxes,

970
00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.200
our thought processes,

971
00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.900
our investigation,

972
00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:33.600
what we conceived because of what we've been told.

973
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.600
<v Voiceover>Our educational system only furthers that.</v>

974
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:37.680
<v ->Yes.</v>

975
00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:41.980
It doesn't allow somebody to really be unique.

976
00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:44.280
It is a program that you have to do this.

977
00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.560
And I always marveled at the stories,

978
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.578
I wasn't brilliant enough to ever go to this

979
00:44:48.578 --> 00:44:52.537
but this people who turn into blue book of college

980
00:44:52.537 --> 00:44:53.575
and they have the answer

981
00:44:53.575 --> 00:44:55.835
but they didn't know how to do it,

982
00:44:55.835 --> 00:44:56.935
and they couldn't explain it,

983
00:44:56.935 --> 00:44:58.651
so they ended up getting the--

984
00:44:58.651 --> 00:45:00.489
They got a failed grade or somebody

985
00:45:00.489 --> 00:45:03.989
starts accusing them of cheating, they're just people

986
00:45:03.989 --> 00:45:06.828
who look at something.

987
00:45:06.828 --> 00:45:08.629
We also shared a little bit.

988
00:45:08.629 --> 00:45:10.569
And your viewers are probably gonna be saying,

989
00:45:10.569 --> 00:45:12.547
these people shared a lot off camera,

990
00:45:12.547 --> 00:45:14.424
but we spoke about Goethe,

991
00:45:14.424 --> 00:45:15.285
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

992
00:45:15.285 --> 00:45:19.638
<v ->Goethe who was, or as American would say, Goethe</v>

993
00:45:19.638 --> 00:45:21.239
but Goethe--

994
00:45:21.239 --> 00:45:21.997
<v Voiceover>Oh, I went to,</v>

995
00:45:21.997 --> 00:45:23.656
my junior high school had that name

996
00:45:23.656 --> 00:45:25.077
and we called it Goethe.

997
00:45:25.077 --> 00:45:26.457
<v ->Goethe?</v>

998
00:45:26.457 --> 00:45:30.001
Well, mister G-O-E-T-H-E was,

999
00:45:30.001 --> 00:45:32.962
he was an incredible person because

1000
00:45:32.962 --> 00:45:35.342
when he was asked the question about

1001
00:45:35.342 --> 00:45:37.562
why he did not speak much about God,

1002
00:45:37.562 --> 00:45:40.022
was it because he didn't believe in God,

1003
00:45:40.022 --> 00:45:42.322
his answer was,

1004
00:45:42.322 --> 00:45:44.002
"No, it isn't,

1005
00:45:44.002 --> 00:45:46.042
"that is not the reason why I don't discuss it,

1006
00:45:46.042 --> 00:45:48.722
"but I cannot really get into a subject

1007
00:45:48.722 --> 00:45:51.982
"where I don't have enough information to really

1008
00:45:51.982 --> 00:45:56.662
"form a legitimate decision about it.

1009
00:45:56.662 --> 00:45:59.402
"I really don't have enough information

1010
00:45:59.402 --> 00:46:03.242
"of personal investigation to do this."

1011
00:46:03.242 --> 00:46:06.202
And of course in the ancient hermetic writings

1012
00:46:06.202 --> 00:46:10.582
supposedly when Hermes Trismegistus, the great Hermes

1013
00:46:10.582 --> 00:46:13.002
was asked to speak of God,

1014
00:46:13.002 --> 00:46:16.482
he put his finger on his lips

1015
00:46:16.482 --> 00:46:18.922
because the finite

1016
00:46:18.922 --> 00:46:21.766
can never completely define the infinite.

1017
00:46:21.766 --> 00:46:26.766
And so when we have people who are defining the deity

1018
00:46:27.886 --> 00:46:29.946
based on their parlance

1019
00:46:29.946 --> 00:46:31.326
this is shutting them off

1020
00:46:31.326 --> 00:46:33.686
from the great streams of the cosmos.

1021
00:46:33.686 --> 00:46:36.766
And you see, everything always fits in.

1022
00:46:36.766 --> 00:46:39.047
These streams enclosing the doors,

1023
00:46:39.047 --> 00:46:42.187
and taking our young children

1024
00:46:42.187 --> 00:46:45.168
and defining them and putting them in little boxes,

1025
00:46:45.168 --> 00:46:47.888
they're never allowed to expand naturally.

1026
00:46:47.888 --> 00:46:52.228
You take a plant, a seed, and place it in the ground

1027
00:46:52.228 --> 00:46:54.388
and there's only three inch clearance

1028
00:46:54.388 --> 00:46:57.148
before there's a solid ceiling,

1029
00:46:57.148 --> 00:47:00.288
that plant will never grow to full expression.

1030
00:47:00.288 --> 00:47:02.808
<v Voiceover>Perfectly put, and when you take a child</v>

1031
00:47:02.808 --> 00:47:07.748
and you fill all of its after school time with one activity,

1032
00:47:07.748 --> 00:47:11.048
striving towards some sort of excellence after another,

1033
00:47:11.048 --> 00:47:12.668
there is no time for imagination,

1034
00:47:12.668 --> 00:47:14.948
there's no time for creation,

1035
00:47:14.948 --> 00:47:16.848
there's no time to laugh,

1036
00:47:16.848 --> 00:47:18.108
or to play,

1037
00:47:18.108 --> 00:47:19.189
to LEFL.

1038
00:47:19.189 --> 00:47:23.229
<v ->The LEFLing has somehow is disintegrating.</v>

1039
00:47:23.229 --> 00:47:24.849
And even when I've asked people

1040
00:47:24.849 --> 00:47:27.749
when I'm counseling with them and I'll go,

1041
00:47:27.749 --> 00:47:29.869
what makes you laugh?

1042
00:47:29.869 --> 00:47:32.431
And I have somebody blankly look at me like,

1043
00:47:32.431 --> 00:47:35.271
"I, I, I, I don't know."

1044
00:47:35.271 --> 00:47:38.195
And I say, "Well, when was the last time you laughed?"

1045
00:47:38.195 --> 00:47:40.135
The more ill the person is,

1046
00:47:40.135 --> 00:47:43.835
the longer the time between fun, laughter,

1047
00:47:43.835 --> 00:47:45.235
excitement, fun, and love,

1048
00:47:45.235 --> 00:47:46.395
they just don't have it.

1049
00:47:46.395 --> 00:47:47.415
I've seen this again,

1050
00:47:47.415 --> 00:47:48.895
I've worked with thousands and thousands

1051
00:47:48.895 --> 00:47:50.215
of people over the years.

1052
00:47:50.215 --> 00:47:54.255
That LEFL, LEFLameter is so, that's good,

1053
00:47:54.255 --> 00:47:58.855
is so devoid that they don't know what to do.

1054
00:47:58.855 --> 00:48:00.775
So, people have heard

1055
00:48:00.775 --> 00:48:02.795
or people have been recommended to me

1056
00:48:02.795 --> 00:48:05.657
and they come and they're waiting for some

1057
00:48:05.657 --> 00:48:09.697
traumatic solution that I'm gonna give them

1058
00:48:09.697 --> 00:48:10.937
and I look at them and I'll go,

1059
00:48:10.937 --> 00:48:12.917
they'll say, "Steve, what can I do?

1060
00:48:12.917 --> 00:48:14.759
"How can I pull myself out?

1061
00:48:14.759 --> 00:48:17.819
"How can I cure myself?" and I'll go,

1062
00:48:17.819 --> 00:48:20.142
"You need to miniature golf."

1063
00:48:20.142 --> 00:48:21.902
And they go, "What?"

1064
00:48:21.902 --> 00:48:24.463
Miniature golf or some people call it putt putt, they'll go,

1065
00:48:24.463 --> 00:48:25.443
"No, no, seriously."

1066
00:48:25.443 --> 00:48:27.343
I go, "I'm being serious."

1067
00:48:27.343 --> 00:48:32.343
"When was the last time that you are able to do something

1068
00:48:32.663 --> 00:48:34.043
"where you had fun?

1069
00:48:34.043 --> 00:48:35.323
"That you laughed?

1070
00:48:35.323 --> 00:48:37.103
"That you enjoyed it?"

1071
00:48:37.103 --> 00:48:37.963
And then they'll tell me,

1072
00:48:37.963 --> 00:48:39.323
"Why, you know I work for pleasure."

1073
00:48:39.323 --> 00:48:42.976
I say, "Excuse me, this is part of your difficulty."

1074
00:48:42.976 --> 00:48:46.567
We're talking a full expression.

1075
00:48:47.577 --> 00:48:51.077
So, we don't need to have complicated solutions.

1076
00:48:51.077 --> 00:48:53.517
In fact, it was my good buddy Paracelsus

1077
00:48:53.517 --> 00:48:55.777
in the 15th hundred who said,

1078
00:48:55.777 --> 00:48:59.697
"The longer the answer to a difficulty,

1079
00:48:59.697 --> 00:49:02.537
"the more screwed up the speaker is,

1080
00:49:02.537 --> 00:49:05.140
"and the further away they are for the truth

1081
00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:08.180
"because it just isn't that difficult

1082
00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:10.840
"and they must wanna hear themselves speak."

1083
00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:13.240
And he was great because

1084
00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.360
everything he did was so clever.

1085
00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:20.360
As a youth, Paracelsus watched a dog in the house

1086
00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:22.580
who'd been ill,

1087
00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:25.260
get up during the party and start walking.

1088
00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:26.940
So, he was a young kid

1089
00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:28.960
and he wasn't interested in what the party was,

1090
00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:30.340
so he followed the dog.

1091
00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.480
And the doggie walked and

1092
00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:34.721
walked through the forest and passed different flowers

1093
00:49:34.721 --> 00:49:37.642
and would sniff and then walk on and finally stop

1094
00:49:37.642 --> 00:49:41.773
and started nibbling on a particular plant or grass.

1095
00:49:43.023 --> 00:49:44.863
Closed its eyes, woke up

1096
00:49:44.863 --> 00:49:47.163
and was as good as new.

1097
00:49:47.163 --> 00:49:50.663
And Paracelsus looked to that and said,

1098
00:49:50.663 --> 00:49:53.443
There is no doggie doctor,

1099
00:49:53.443 --> 00:49:56.323
how was this animal--

1100
00:49:56.323 --> 00:49:58.523
And then he understood instinct

1101
00:49:58.523 --> 00:50:01.763
and then he reasoned, wait a minute,

1102
00:50:01.763 --> 00:50:04.023
we as human beings have this.

1103
00:50:04.023 --> 00:50:05.643
What is going on here?

1104
00:50:05.643 --> 00:50:08.223
Why are we not able?

1105
00:50:08.223 --> 00:50:10.005
Because we have been closed off

1106
00:50:10.005 --> 00:50:12.425
from our own innate abilities.

1107
00:50:12.425 --> 00:50:15.785
We have listened to what other people have to say.

1108
00:50:15.785 --> 00:50:19.825
We have lost that instinct which by the way

1109
00:50:19.825 --> 00:50:22.605
is really intuition.

1110
00:50:22.605 --> 00:50:25.885
Instinct in animals is instinct,

1111
00:50:25.885 --> 00:50:29.245
in human beings is called intuition.

1112
00:50:29.245 --> 00:50:32.485
And that intuition, when we get back to it

1113
00:50:32.485 --> 00:50:36.025
will lead us to the more enlightened areas

1114
00:50:36.025 --> 00:50:37.325
that we need to be in.

1115
00:50:37.325 --> 00:50:39.605
<v Voiceover>Including drawing more beauty into our lives.</v>

1116
00:50:39.605 --> 00:50:41.885
<v ->Always, and you can never, Regina,</v>

1117
00:50:41.885 --> 00:50:43.525
never can have enough beauty.

1118
00:50:43.525 --> 00:50:46.085
Now, I tried to create a room

1119
00:50:46.085 --> 00:50:48.225
that somebody can immerse himself

1120
00:50:48.225 --> 00:50:51.205
but I would encourage people to have

1121
00:50:51.205 --> 00:50:53.345
a place of beauty,

1122
00:50:53.345 --> 00:50:55.205
a seed of beauty,

1123
00:50:55.205 --> 00:50:56.485
anything that's beautiful

1124
00:50:56.485 --> 00:50:58.585
that they can keep around themselves

1125
00:50:58.585 --> 00:51:03.585
because that vibration will permeate your entire being.

1126
00:51:04.485 --> 00:51:06.405
It is about beauty.

1127
00:51:06.405 --> 00:51:07.885
Live in beauty,

1128
00:51:07.885 --> 00:51:09.225
walk in beauty,

1129
00:51:09.225 --> 00:51:10.656
and you will be beauty.

1130
00:51:12.086 --> 00:51:14.137
<v Voiceover>I could not agree more.</v>

1131
00:51:15.027 --> 00:51:17.587
And thank you so much for inviting us into this

1132
00:51:17.587 --> 00:51:20.067
magical space that you have created,

1133
00:51:20.067 --> 00:51:22.127
this magical space and beauty,

1134
00:51:22.127 --> 00:51:23.287
and LEFL.

1135
00:51:23.287 --> 00:51:26.029
<v ->LEFL, I'm happy that you're here</v>

1136
00:51:26.029 --> 00:51:27.749
and I'm very pleased again

1137
00:51:27.749 --> 00:51:30.309
that you would do a program like this

1138
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:34.469
because LEFL is so easy,

1139
00:51:34.469 --> 00:51:35.969
so inexpensive,

1140
00:51:35.969 --> 00:51:37.769
and so profound.

1141
00:51:37.769 --> 00:51:39.570
<v Voiceover>Thank you, thank you.</v>

1142
00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:40.702
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1143
00:51:42.012 --> 00:51:44.152
<v ->I hope you enjoyed this thought-provoking look</v>

1144
00:51:44.152 --> 00:51:45.470
at the subject of beauty.

1145
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:46.610
