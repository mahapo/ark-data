00:00:00.771 --> 00:00:03.611
ï»¿- Tim Freke had an awakening at the age of 12,

2
00:00:03.611 --> 00:00:06.092
the kind that one reads about in spiritual tomes.

3
00:00:06.092 --> 00:00:08.212
He spent the rest of his life trying to understand

4
00:00:08.212 --> 00:00:11.012
how all of us can reach this level of connection

5
00:00:11.012 --> 00:00:14.472
with our most primal and refined other part of self.

6
00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:16.914
Known today as a stand-up philosopher and author

7
00:00:16.914 --> 00:00:19.014
of several books including "Lucid Living",

8
00:00:19.014 --> 00:00:21.814
Tim speaks with me about embracing all of our parts

9
00:00:21.814 --> 00:00:24.214
in the journey back to our true selves.

10
00:00:24.214 --> 00:00:28.845 line:15% 
(upbeat lively music)

11
00:00:31.675 --> 00:00:34.315
The journey didn't begin yesterday for you.

12
00:00:34.315 --> 00:00:37.655
For you, as I recall, you were around nine years old

13
00:00:37.655 --> 00:00:40.755
there was something that occurred in your life at that time

14
00:00:40.755 --> 00:00:44.255
that spun you into a new level of contemplation.

15
00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:46.035
<v ->I was a little bit older, I was about 12.</v>

16
00:00:46.035 --> 00:00:47.377
<v Voiceover>12, okay.</v>

17
00:00:47.377 --> 00:00:50.778
<v ->And it always seemed strange.</v>

18
00:00:50.778 --> 00:00:55.778
Life has always seemed strange to me, it still does.

19
00:00:55.988 --> 00:00:59.258
Just profoundly mysterious that it is,

20
00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:00.758
this is here, that we don't know what it is,

21
00:01:00.758 --> 00:01:02.598
that we're thrown in to this life.

22
00:01:02.598 --> 00:01:05.718
And even as a kid, well especially perhaps as a kid,

23
00:01:05.718 --> 00:01:07.798
and being surrounded by all these grown-ups

24
00:01:07.798 --> 00:01:10.359
who were walking around as if they knew what life is.

25
00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:13.559
It seemed hysterically funny and also very troubling.

26
00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:17.179
You know, the teachers, my parents, everyone.

27
00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:20.099
No one seemed to be asking the big questions.

28
00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:21.439
It was like they entered into some sort

29
00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.279
of mutual conspiracy, whereby everyone had agreed

30
00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:26.219
not to mention the elephant in the room,

31
00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.379
and the elephant is nobody knows what this is.

32
00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:33.579
And I used to sit on this hill above this sleepy hometown

33
00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.399
where I grew up, just thinking about, "What is life,

34
00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:37.879
"what is suffering, what is death?"

35
00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:38.679
<v Voiceover>And you were 12?</v>

36
00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:40.219
<v ->Twelve, yeah.</v>

37
00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.123
And one day something just happened,

38
00:01:43.232 --> 00:01:45.432
where it felt like the top of my head came off

39
00:01:45.432 --> 00:01:46.992
and the sky came pouring in.

40
00:01:46.992 --> 00:01:49.992
It was like I stepped in to a secret garden, something,

41
00:01:49.992 --> 00:01:53.092
just the transformation of consciousness.

42
00:01:53.092 --> 00:01:56.392
And there was this oneness and this love;

43
00:01:56.392 --> 00:01:58.433
that was the thing which I noticed the most

44
00:01:58.433 --> 00:01:59.972
and which made the biggest impression.

45
00:01:59.972 --> 00:02:02.512
Tim was utterly, utterly loved 'cause the universe

46
00:02:02.512 --> 00:02:04.752
was just permeated with love.

47
00:02:04.752 --> 00:02:07.852
And in some way that I couldn't possibly comprehend

48
00:02:07.852 --> 00:02:09.592
I was the love loving Tim

49
00:02:09.592 --> 00:02:12.092
as much as I was Tim being loved.

50
00:02:12.092 --> 00:02:16.348
<v Voiceover>So you were aware of the larger aspect</v>

51
00:02:16.348 --> 00:02:19.548
of your being, the greater, the finer aspect of your being

52
00:02:19.548 --> 00:02:23.008
even then by knowing that somehow Tim was loving Tim?

53
00:02:24.338 --> 00:02:25.206
<v ->I mean, looking back.</v>

54
00:02:25.206 --> 00:02:25.963
<v Voiceover>Yeah, yeah.</v>

55
00:02:25.963 --> 00:02:28.144
<v ->That's what happened.</v>

56
00:02:28.144 --> 00:02:32.262
I mean, something I write about and do a lot with people

57
00:02:32.262 --> 00:02:34.322
was just to come in to the mystery.

58
00:02:34.322 --> 00:02:35.062
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

59
00:02:35.062 --> 00:02:37.402
<v ->Just when we step out of the story of who we are</v>

60
00:02:37.402 --> 00:02:38.701
and what life is.

61
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:43.562
And just become conscious of this breathtaking mystery

62
00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:46.541
of this moment - that it is.

63
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:49.045
<v Voiceover>And yet most of us walk right past it.</v>

64
00:02:49.045 --> 00:02:50.925
We don't even see the moments of our lives.

65
00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:53.665
<v ->Isn't that interesting, where like we're so unconscious</v>

66
00:02:53.665 --> 00:02:56.465
that we don't even notice the most obvious thing

67
00:02:56.465 --> 00:02:58.365
which is we don't know what this is.

68
00:02:58.365 --> 00:02:59.105
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

69
00:02:59.105 --> 00:03:00.545
<v ->And if we don't notice the most obvious thing,</v>

70
00:03:00.545 --> 00:03:01.825
what else don't we notice?

71
00:03:01.825 --> 00:03:02.605
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

72
00:03:02.605 --> 00:03:05.065
<v ->And that becomes an exciting thing for me because,</v>

73
00:03:05.065 --> 00:03:06.265
"Okay, well let's explore that.

74
00:03:06.265 --> 00:03:08.085
"Let's dive into the mystery.

75
00:03:08.085 --> 00:03:10.485
"Let's not know for a moment."

76
00:03:10.485 --> 00:03:12.985
<v Voiceover>Yes, and at the same time what's interesting,</v>

77
00:03:12.985 --> 00:03:15.045
you spoke about this, as though all the adults

78
00:03:15.045 --> 00:03:17.305
seem to know what life was about.

79
00:03:17.305 --> 00:03:19.485
There was this collective agreement

80
00:03:19.485 --> 00:03:21.585
that they somehow knew something

81
00:03:21.585 --> 00:03:22.525
even though those questions

82
00:03:22.525 --> 00:03:23.485
weren't even being asked.

83
00:03:23.485 --> 00:03:25.525
And that just brings to mind one thing

84
00:03:25.525 --> 00:03:28.405
that is kind of interesting because if you take it

85
00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:30.165
to what appears to be the top

86
00:03:30.165 --> 00:03:33.505
of the socioeconomic food chain in the West,

87
00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:36.625
you're looking at say Fortune 500 executives,

88
00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:39.025
that's who people look at on the news and say,

89
00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:41.265
"Oh, now that person knows what's going on.

90
00:03:41.265 --> 00:03:43.485
"Look what they've developed in their lives," right?

91
00:03:43.485 --> 00:03:46.065
It's purely material, but nonetheless.

92
00:03:46.065 --> 00:03:47.665
One of the things I found very interesting

93
00:03:47.665 --> 00:03:50.285
is a number of years ago, there was a survey

94
00:03:50.285 --> 00:03:52.585
that was done with Fortune 500 CEOs

95
00:03:52.585 --> 00:03:54.945
and what was the one thing they fear the most?

96
00:03:54.945 --> 00:03:57.385
The one thing they fear the most is that sooner or later

97
00:03:57.385 --> 00:04:00.405
they were going to be revealed for the fraud

98
00:04:00.405 --> 00:04:02.005
that they truly were.

99
00:04:02.005 --> 00:04:03.865
Isn't that amazing?

100
00:04:03.865 --> 00:04:05.506
<v ->And I find that all the time,</v>

101
00:04:05.506 --> 00:04:06.786
I think we're all like that.

102
00:04:06.786 --> 00:04:07.541
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

103
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:08.620
<v ->'Cause we're all pretending.</v>

104
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.361
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

105
00:04:09.361 --> 00:04:11.540
<v ->We're pretending we know who we are and what this is.</v>

106
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.540
And honestly, I don't think anyone knows what this is.

107
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.320
Not even someone living in a cave in Swami,

108
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.880
Bananarama, or up in the Himalayas.

109
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.860
Nobody knows what this is.

110
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.150
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

111
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.799
<v ->It is by its nature a mystery.</v>

112
00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:28.969
It is something which is out to know it.

113
00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:30.738
You can't know it as an object.

114
00:04:30.738 --> 00:04:31.538
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

115
00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:33.158
<v ->You have to just be one with it to know it.</v>

116
00:04:33.158 --> 00:04:36.479
And that's a change of consciousness, not at set of ideas.

117
00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:37.795
<v Voiceover>And you really do something,</v>

118
00:04:37.795 --> 00:04:40.154
what drew me to your work which is quite interesting,

119
00:04:40.154 --> 00:04:41.733
you have this wonderful little book,

120
00:04:41.733 --> 00:04:43.773
it's as you say a one-hour read

121
00:04:43.773 --> 00:04:46.173
through consciousness and awareness,

122
00:04:46.173 --> 00:04:48.783
and it's called "Lucid Living".

123
00:04:48.783 --> 00:04:52.471
When you explain this you start with the explanation

124
00:04:52.471 --> 00:04:55.191
of lucid dreaming because this is more something

125
00:04:55.191 --> 00:04:56.791
that people can relate to.

126
00:04:56.791 --> 00:05:00.311
Can we back engineer it, going through the dream state?

127
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:02.991
<v ->Well, what fascinates me is that we enter this state</v>

128
00:05:02.991 --> 00:05:04.572
of dreaming everyday.

129
00:05:04.572 --> 00:05:06.192
And it's pretty strange, this world is old

130
00:05:06.192 --> 00:05:07.331
on a regular basis.

131
00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:08.696
<v Voiceover>And we accept that as a mystery.</v>

132
00:05:08.696 --> 00:05:10.056
<v ->And we just go along with it.</v>

133
00:05:10.056 --> 00:05:10.876
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

134
00:05:10.876 --> 00:05:12.597
<v ->Hey, I'm gonna lie down.</v>

135
00:05:12.597 --> 00:05:13.437
This is gonna go.

136
00:05:13.437 --> 00:05:14.317
I won't be Tim.

137
00:05:14.317 --> 00:05:16.617
Whoa, I'll be catapulted into another world

138
00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:18.177
and different things will happen.

139
00:05:18.177 --> 00:05:19.517
And then I'll disappear altogether

140
00:05:19.517 --> 00:05:21.677
and there'll be this presence in which I am

141
00:05:21.677 --> 00:05:23.157
but I don't know that I am.

142
00:05:23.157 --> 00:05:24.457
And then, hoof, Tim will be back.

143
00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:26.418
And I think nothing of it (laughs).

144
00:05:26.418 --> 00:05:27.291
<v Voiceover>Isn't it amazing?</v>

145
00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:28.511
We're totally comfortable within

146
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:33.191
except this bizarre other mysterious element of our lives.

147
00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:35.429
<v ->But when we do dream we're lost in it,</v>

148
00:05:35.429 --> 00:05:37.409
we think we are who we appear to be in the dream.

149
00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:38.709
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

150
00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:41.187
<v ->If you dream lucidly, if you dream consciously,</v>

151
00:05:41.187 --> 00:05:42.766
it puts you in this very interesting place

152
00:05:42.766 --> 00:05:45.527
where you realize you have two natures

153
00:05:45.527 --> 00:05:47.803
or there's a polarity to your nature.

154
00:05:47.803 --> 00:05:48.821
On the one hand you're the person

155
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:51.501
you used to be in the dream,

156
00:05:51.501 --> 00:05:54.841
but actually you're what, you're the dreamer,

157
00:05:54.841 --> 00:05:56.341
you're the awareness within which

158
00:05:56.341 --> 00:05:58.155
the whole dream is arising.

159
00:05:58.155 --> 00:06:00.914
And there's no separation between what you are

160
00:06:00.914 --> 00:06:03.575
and the whole dream; you are the dream.

161
00:06:03.575 --> 00:06:06.475
You're experiencing it by being one small fragment

162
00:06:06.475 --> 00:06:10.475
of the dream, but you're actually the whole dream.

163
00:06:10.475 --> 00:06:12.475
Now, my exploration of the mystery of the moment

164
00:06:12.475 --> 00:06:16.615
has led me to see that this is the same now.

165
00:06:16.615 --> 00:06:19.735
It's a different arc of the same thing

166
00:06:19.735 --> 00:06:21.875
that life is also like a dream.

167
00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:23.315
<v Voiceover>It has to be.</v>

168
00:06:23.315 --> 00:06:26.075
<v ->And we become lost to them.</v>

169
00:06:26.075 --> 00:06:29.375
We're so unconscious we don't even notice it's mysterious.

170
00:06:29.375 --> 00:06:32.195
But actually become more conscious you recognize here

171
00:06:32.195 --> 00:06:35.192
there's a polarity to your identity.

172
00:06:35.192 --> 00:06:37.690
On the one hand there's the person you appear to be

173
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.448
in this dream, in this flow of colors and shapes and sounds

174
00:06:41.448 --> 00:06:45.088
and then there's what you are; the presence of awareness

175
00:06:45.088 --> 00:06:47.084
within which the whole dream is arising.

176
00:06:47.084 --> 00:06:49.864
This vast spacious emptiness within which everything,

177
00:06:49.864 --> 00:06:53.944
and there's no separation between what we are

178
00:06:53.944 --> 00:06:55.584
and what this is.

179
00:06:55.584 --> 00:06:58.204
So here, you and I are separate individuals

180
00:06:58.204 --> 00:06:59.980
and that's what's so funny.

181
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:00.840
It's so great.

182
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.020
We're different.

183
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.580
But here, there's one of us, dreaming itself

184
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.820
to be everything and everyone.

185
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.640
And when we meet as one and separate there's this love

186
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.020
that I experienced when I was 12 years old

187
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.180
because love is how oneness feels and you love someone

188
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.140
it's because you're not just separate.

189
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.238
<v Voiceover>It's this unity.</v>

190
00:07:20.238 --> 00:07:23.714
<v ->There's this unity and this feeling of connection</v>

191
00:07:23.714 --> 00:07:25.594
is what we call love.

192
00:07:25.594 --> 00:07:28.234
So for me, ultimately, it's about love.

193
00:07:28.234 --> 00:07:30.454
And that love arises when we're not just lost

194
00:07:30.454 --> 00:07:31.874
in the separateness.

195
00:07:31.874 --> 00:07:33.494
We don't need to reject the separateness,

196
00:07:33.494 --> 00:07:34.954
the dreams are not going anywhere.

197
00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:36.894
I'm still Tim, just a guy.

198
00:07:36.894 --> 00:07:39.734
This little vulnerable spec which would come and go.

199
00:07:39.734 --> 00:07:44.734
I'm attached, I care, I have my family, I'm human

200
00:07:44.834 --> 00:07:48.254
and yet as well there's this vast spaciousness.

201
00:07:48.254 --> 00:07:51.074
And I don't have to reject my humanity

202
00:07:51.074 --> 00:07:53.474
to discover my divinity, if you will.

203
00:07:53.474 --> 00:07:56.474
<v Voiceover>But did you know that all along,</v>

204
00:07:56.474 --> 00:07:58.554
or is this something that you ultimately

205
00:07:58.554 --> 00:08:00.834
had to mature into the awareness of?

206
00:08:00.834 --> 00:08:03.714
Because it seems like, for a lot of people

207
00:08:03.714 --> 00:08:07.214
the journey has been, they'll have a moment

208
00:08:07.214 --> 00:08:12.214
of lucidity such as yours at 12 which catapults people

209
00:08:12.934 --> 00:08:16.234
on to becoming the nothingness.

210
00:08:16.234 --> 00:08:20.414
And shedding yourself of human characteristics and traits

211
00:08:20.414 --> 00:08:23.954
and attachments and all these sorts of things,

212
00:08:23.954 --> 00:08:27.294
and that seems to be the actual destination

213
00:08:27.294 --> 00:08:30.374
many people aspire to then from that moment.

214
00:08:30.374 --> 00:08:31.134
<v ->Yes.</v>

215
00:08:31.134 --> 00:08:32.214
<v Voiceover>But what happened with you--</v>

216
00:08:32.214 --> 00:08:33.172
<v ->It was the same.</v>

217
00:08:33.172 --> 00:08:36.172
For me I've had a very archetypal journey.

218
00:08:36.172 --> 00:08:38.270
I came out and the whole world, whoa,

219
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.608
and I was back here.

220
00:08:39.608 --> 00:08:40.348
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

221
00:08:40.348 --> 00:08:41.507
<v ->And then there's this longing.</v>

222
00:08:41.507 --> 00:08:43.567
"Oh my God, I want that love and oneness again.

223
00:08:43.567 --> 00:08:44.608
"Where can I find it?"

224
00:08:44.608 --> 00:08:49.168
And I played with every form of philosophy in practice

225
00:08:49.168 --> 00:08:50.888
and drugs and everything I could do

226
00:08:50.888 --> 00:08:52.408
to transform consciousness and I found

227
00:08:52.408 --> 00:08:53.668
that it happened again and again,

228
00:08:53.668 --> 00:08:55.688
and I've lose it again and I'd find it again.

229
00:08:55.688 --> 00:08:59.628
And my life was like ooh, ahh, ooh, ahh, ooh, ahh.

230
00:08:59.628 --> 00:09:02.288
And what that can lead to quite naturally is,

231
00:09:02.288 --> 00:09:03.428
"Oh this is the problem.

232
00:09:03.428 --> 00:09:04.428
"Tim is the problem.

233
00:09:04.428 --> 00:09:08.508
"I've got to get rid of this so I can experience this."

234
00:09:08.508 --> 00:09:10.548
And a lot of spirituality teaches that.

235
00:09:10.548 --> 00:09:11.188
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

236
00:09:11.188 --> 00:09:12.505
<v ->So that's what I thought I had to do.</v>

237
00:09:12.505 --> 00:09:14.226
<v Voiceover>How are you impractical if you're still</v>

238
00:09:14.226 --> 00:09:16.365
embodied here though?

239
00:09:16.365 --> 00:09:18.205
<v ->What's happened to me now is having made</v>

240
00:09:18.205 --> 00:09:21.505
this convoluted journey through the labyrinth

241
00:09:21.505 --> 00:09:23.985
I feel kinda back to where I was when I started,

242
00:09:23.985 --> 00:09:26.486
only this time I know what it is.

243
00:09:26.486 --> 00:09:27.865
When I was 12 I didn't know what it was.

244
00:09:27.865 --> 00:09:31.285
Now I know what it is, I have a way of understanding

245
00:09:31.285 --> 00:09:33.725
and it just seems natural to me now.

246
00:09:33.725 --> 00:09:35.905
And it's not about getting rid of everything,

247
00:09:35.905 --> 00:09:39.765
it's about noticing something else as well

248
00:09:39.765 --> 00:09:41.744
that there's this polarity, it's not either/or,

249
00:09:41.744 --> 00:09:45.603
it's both/and, that we are this presence, this oneness.

250
00:09:45.603 --> 00:09:47.224
That's a reality.

251
00:09:47.224 --> 00:09:48.364
And to be conscious of it

252
00:09:48.364 --> 00:09:50.604
is the most beautiful thing in the world.

253
00:09:50.604 --> 00:09:51.803
But this isn't going anywhere.

254
00:09:51.803 --> 00:09:54.763
And not only do we not have to get rid of anything,

255
00:09:54.763 --> 00:09:58.304
actually I feel the opposite, this is very precious.

256
00:09:58.304 --> 00:10:00.883
Because the love brings us back in

257
00:10:00.883 --> 00:10:03.744
and that's where we can really engage

258
00:10:03.744 --> 00:10:05.183
with this dream of love.

259
00:10:05.183 --> 00:10:06.201
'Cause it's incredible really.

260
00:10:06.201 --> 00:10:08.801
Actually there's a line in one of the Gnostic Gospels

261
00:10:08.801 --> 00:10:11.402
which I really love, I think it's in the Gospel of Philip,

262
00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:12.769
written along in the Gnostics.

263
00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:17.178
And it says, "Those who are free because of gnosis,"

264
00:10:17.178 --> 00:10:19.999
and it's knowledge, it's knowing you are free,

265
00:10:19.999 --> 00:10:23.492
remember that, liberation it is.

266
00:10:23.492 --> 00:10:25.492
But those who are free because of gnosis

267
00:10:25.492 --> 00:10:28.553
become slaves because of love.

268
00:10:28.553 --> 00:10:31.253
And the love pulls you back in to the world

269
00:10:31.253 --> 00:10:34.312
of this and that, the duality of joy and suffering

270
00:10:34.312 --> 00:10:38.092
so that you can really celebrate the joy

271
00:10:38.092 --> 00:10:39.872
and ameliorate the suffering.

272
00:10:39.872 --> 00:10:42.452
You want to engage with that so that my humanity,

273
00:10:42.452 --> 00:10:44.209
the irony for me is I travel around the world

274
00:10:44.209 --> 00:10:46.289
talking about waking up to oneness,

275
00:10:46.289 --> 00:10:48.449
but what I really want is people to engage

276
00:10:48.449 --> 00:10:49.249
with the separateness.

277
00:10:49.249 --> 00:10:50.514
<v Voiceover>I know, I was going to bring that up</v>

278
00:10:50.514 --> 00:10:51.914
because I found that ironic.

279
00:10:51.914 --> 00:10:54.314
Because you are speaking at the Science and Nonduality--

280
00:10:54.314 --> 00:10:55.355
<v ->I know.</v>

281
00:10:55.355 --> 00:10:58.015
<v Voiceover>Conference and you say, essentially,</v>

282
00:10:58.015 --> 00:11:00.335
without going into the physics of it all

283
00:11:00.335 --> 00:11:02.355
and the quantum field of it,

284
00:11:02.355 --> 00:11:05.895
you can't even have that recognition unless you are

285
00:11:05.895 --> 00:11:08.475
distinctly dual in nature.

286
00:11:08.475 --> 00:11:09.255
<v ->Exactly.</v>

287
00:11:09.255 --> 00:11:10.475
<v Voiceover>Because you have to have this reflection</v>

288
00:11:10.475 --> 00:11:12.855
to be able to bounce off at the other awareness.

289
00:11:12.855 --> 00:11:15.295
<v ->And awareness in itself is unconscious.</v>

290
00:11:15.295 --> 00:11:16.135
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

291
00:11:16.135 --> 00:11:17.097
<v ->That's where we go every night.</v>

292
00:11:17.097 --> 00:11:17.737
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

293
00:11:17.737 --> 00:11:18.897
<v ->That's where we go.</v>

294
00:11:18.897 --> 00:11:21.615
And it's all one, so we don't know what it is.

295
00:11:21.615 --> 00:11:23.315
And people say to me, "Oh Tim, Tim,

296
00:11:23.315 --> 00:11:24.235
"I wanna be one with everything."

297
00:11:24.235 --> 00:11:26.273
And I just go, "Okay, great, go to sleep."

298
00:11:26.273 --> 00:11:28.133
<v Voiceover>(laughs) Very true.</v>

299
00:11:28.133 --> 00:11:30.373
<v ->Because what we want is to be consciously one</v>

300
00:11:30.373 --> 00:11:31.853
with everything.

301
00:11:31.853 --> 00:11:34.353
But to be conscious is to be separate,

302
00:11:34.353 --> 00:11:35.773
that's what arises in the morning.

303
00:11:35.773 --> 00:11:36.931
Separateness.

304
00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:37.891
What happens?

305
00:11:37.891 --> 00:11:38.931
Subject and object, this and that,

306
00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:42.821
this chair, table, this, head, everything gets,

307
00:11:42.821 --> 00:11:44.549
and we're conscious.

308
00:11:44.549 --> 00:11:46.289
But we'd only get lost in the conscious,

309
00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:47.709
in the separateness.

310
00:11:47.709 --> 00:11:49.189
<v Voiceover>Because that can often lead to a type</v>

311
00:11:49.189 --> 00:11:50.985
of contraction energetically.

312
00:11:50.985 --> 00:11:53.605
Versus in the dream state you go out,

313
00:11:53.605 --> 00:11:56.225
you refresh yourself, your body rejuvenates itself

314
00:11:56.225 --> 00:11:58.205
as you're part of this field of oneness

315
00:11:58.205 --> 00:12:00.345
and play yourself out however you choose,

316
00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:02.505
there are no barriers or boundaries.

317
00:12:02.505 --> 00:12:06.405
You come back in, come crashing, tinglingly crashing back

318
00:12:06.405 --> 00:12:10.105
into the body upon waking in the morning

319
00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:13.205
and then there seems to often be a type of contraction

320
00:12:13.205 --> 00:12:15.145
that occurs after the sleep state.

321
00:12:15.145 --> 00:12:17.825
<v ->Yeah, that's when we get lost in the separateness.</v>

322
00:12:17.825 --> 00:12:19.325
When I call this lucid living,

323
00:12:19.325 --> 00:12:20.825
this state-like lucid dreaming,

324
00:12:20.825 --> 00:12:22.125
it's when you got the both act.

325
00:12:22.125 --> 00:12:22.965
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

326
00:12:22.965 --> 00:12:25.348
<v ->So the journey, if you like, seems to be</v>

327
00:12:25.348 --> 00:12:27.308
from unconsciousness oneness

328
00:12:27.308 --> 00:12:29.368
through conscious separateness

329
00:12:29.368 --> 00:12:30.648
to conscious oneness.

330
00:12:30.648 --> 00:12:32.128
And conscious oneness is separate

331
00:12:32.128 --> 00:12:34.828
and not separate at the same time.

332
00:12:34.828 --> 00:12:36.929
<v Voiceover>And also being aware you're the dreamer.</v>

333
00:12:36.929 --> 00:12:39.111
<v ->Yeah, so you're aware you're the dreamer</v>

334
00:12:39.111 --> 00:12:40.333
but only through appearance,

335
00:12:40.333 --> 00:12:42.513
be this tiny small fragment called Tim.

336
00:12:42.513 --> 00:12:43.813
<v Voiceover>Yes, yes.</v>

337
00:12:43.813 --> 00:12:46.213
You mentioned this a moment ago.

338
00:12:46.213 --> 00:12:50.733
You've written books and articles and quite a lot

339
00:12:50.733 --> 00:12:53.794
on as you say the Gnostic wisdoms,

340
00:12:53.794 --> 00:12:57.275
one was as I recall Mystery of Jesus.

341
00:12:57.275 --> 00:12:58.155
<v ->Jesus Mysteries.</v>

342
00:12:58.155 --> 00:12:59.055
<v Voiceover>Jesus Mysteries.</v>

343
00:12:59.055 --> 00:13:01.812
Also on the Sufi Way.

344
00:13:01.812 --> 00:13:05.125
And so you've studied the various mystical religions--

345
00:13:05.125 --> 00:13:08.168
<v ->I must have written on every single major tradition.</v>

346
00:13:08.168 --> 00:13:09.388
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

347
00:13:09.388 --> 00:13:12.142
So there had to have been

348
00:13:12.142 --> 00:13:15.222
an emergent theme for you that came out of all of them.

349
00:13:15.222 --> 00:13:18.123
Can you articulate what started rising

350
00:13:18.123 --> 00:13:20.783
from your vast studies?

351
00:13:20.783 --> 00:13:22.483
<v ->I was compelled to investigate them all</v>

352
00:13:22.483 --> 00:13:24.183
because I was looking to understand

353
00:13:24.183 --> 00:13:25.803
what was happening to me.

354
00:13:25.803 --> 00:13:27.483
And what I found was there is really,

355
00:13:27.483 --> 00:13:30.453
there is what get called a perennial philosophy,

356
00:13:30.453 --> 00:13:33.181
and it's that there is fundamentally one of us,

357
00:13:33.181 --> 00:13:35.600
that there is one awareness within

358
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.240
which everything is arising.

359
00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.160
And that the recognition of that oneness

360
00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.701
is the experience of compassion, of love.

361
00:13:41.701 --> 00:13:44.820
And that's essentially it; it's as simple as that.

362
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:45.941
And then all these different people,

363
00:13:45.941 --> 00:13:48.097
put it in different languages at different times,

364
00:13:48.097 --> 00:13:50.317
because they're literally speaking different languages

365
00:13:50.317 --> 00:13:53.057
at different times, different cultures.

366
00:13:53.057 --> 00:13:54.837
And that's when it became important to me to say,

367
00:13:54.837 --> 00:13:57.117
"Well how can we say it now

368
00:13:57.117 --> 00:13:59.177
"so that we're not stuck in the past?"

369
00:14:01.737 --> 00:14:03.078
It has been like with music.

370
00:14:03.078 --> 00:14:05.137
If you listen to Beethoven now,

371
00:14:05.137 --> 00:14:06.737
it sounds very conservatory.

372
00:14:06.737 --> 00:14:09.557
People wearing suits, it's so classic with music.

373
00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:10.637
But of course when Beethoven wrote

374
00:14:10.637 --> 00:14:13.797
it was revolutionary, just shocking.

375
00:14:13.797 --> 00:14:15.397
And it happens like that with everything.

376
00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:17.117
So a lot of the spirituality of the past

377
00:14:17.117 --> 00:14:18.757
which was at the time revolutionary

378
00:14:18.757 --> 00:14:21.457
and will wake you up has lost that edge

379
00:14:21.457 --> 00:14:23.818
because it's just been harassed

380
00:14:23.818 --> 00:14:26.658
and we don't understand the words properly anymore,

381
00:14:26.658 --> 00:14:28.578
and it sounds, "Oh."

382
00:14:28.578 --> 00:14:30.837
And so we need to keep reinventing it,

383
00:14:30.837 --> 00:14:33.037
reinventing the way we talk about it.

384
00:14:33.037 --> 00:14:35.058
So my question to philosophers,

385
00:14:35.058 --> 00:14:38.697
"How can I say this so clearly and so simply

386
00:14:38.697 --> 00:14:40.357
"that people go, "Oh my God I've got it."

387
00:14:40.357 --> 00:14:41.796
And my favorite thing, and I have a lot,

388
00:14:41.796 --> 00:14:43.316
it's when people say, "You've just said

389
00:14:43.316 --> 00:14:45.136
"what I've been trying to say."

390
00:14:45.136 --> 00:14:46.576
And that's what I'm experiencing.

391
00:14:46.576 --> 00:14:49.336
And here at this nonduality conference,

392
00:14:49.336 --> 00:14:52.076
coming in and going, "Look guys, we don't wanna,

393
00:14:52.076 --> 00:14:53.416
"let's celebrate the separateness.

394
00:14:53.416 --> 00:14:55.475
"It's not an error.

395
00:14:55.475 --> 00:14:57.796
"It's the foundation from which we can experience

396
00:14:57.796 --> 00:14:59.115
"the oneness."

397
00:14:59.115 --> 00:15:02.716
Has had the most fantastic reception.

398
00:15:02.716 --> 00:15:04.855
It's like a relief, that's my sense.

399
00:15:04.855 --> 00:15:07.155
People were going, "Yeah, that's right.

400
00:15:07.155 --> 00:15:08.236
"That's right."

401
00:15:08.236 --> 00:15:09.235
<v Voiceover>Oh, people very much resonated</v>

402
00:15:09.235 --> 00:15:10.011
to what you were saying yesterday.

403
00:15:10.011 --> 00:15:12.861
I was in the audience, yes.

404
00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:13.768
<v ->We know this.</v>

405
00:15:13.768 --> 00:15:16.209
And the problem is we get a voice inside of us.

406
00:15:16.209 --> 00:15:18.748
When you hear, "Oh get rid of the ego,"

407
00:15:18.748 --> 00:15:21.929
or, "Not be attached," or, "Deny your humanity."

408
00:15:21.929 --> 00:15:23.969
Some voice inside goes, "No, no, no."

409
00:15:23.969 --> 00:15:25.649
And we go, "Oh, that's the enemy.

410
00:15:25.649 --> 00:15:27.289
"That voice, that's my ego, I got to get rid of it."

411
00:15:27.289 --> 00:15:29.508
And it's not, it's wisdom.

412
00:15:29.508 --> 00:15:32.749
That voice which we think is the enemy is actually wisdom

413
00:15:32.749 --> 00:15:36.529
going, "Don't get rid of this, you need this.

414
00:15:36.529 --> 00:15:38.767
"You just want this as well."

415
00:15:38.767 --> 00:15:39.572
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

416
00:15:39.572 --> 00:15:40.992
<v ->And we end up fighting ourself.</v>

417
00:15:40.992 --> 00:15:43.052
We end up in a civil war with ourself.

418
00:15:43.052 --> 00:15:45.932
And like all war, civil war is completely pointless.

419
00:15:45.932 --> 00:15:47.272
It leads nowhere.

420
00:15:47.272 --> 00:15:48.312
<v Voiceover>It is indeed.</v>

421
00:15:48.312 --> 00:15:51.852
And it seems as though what you just said

422
00:15:51.852 --> 00:15:54.433
to even attempt, which is feudal,

423
00:15:54.433 --> 00:15:57.993
to attempt to release that aspect that we call ego,

424
00:15:57.993 --> 00:16:00.953
which I think is a very much misunderstood term

425
00:16:00.953 --> 00:16:03.012
to begin with.

426
00:16:03.012 --> 00:16:04.849
Basically, we need to be ready to let go

427
00:16:04.849 --> 00:16:07.709
of this physical experience at the same time.

428
00:16:07.709 --> 00:16:08.470
<v ->Yes.</v>

429
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:09.549
<v Voiceover>I mean, it's hand in hand.</v>

430
00:16:09.549 --> 00:16:13.153
That is the accumulation of the,

431
00:16:13.153 --> 00:16:15.493
if you want to call it a total experience

432
00:16:15.493 --> 00:16:18.535
of lifetime after lifetime, is what is indicated

433
00:16:18.535 --> 00:16:19.755
in what we call the ego,

434
00:16:19.755 --> 00:16:22.776
it's our understanding of oneness.

435
00:16:22.776 --> 00:16:25.839
<v ->For me, the key idea is polarity,</v>

436
00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:29.056
I've said it a few times, but what is a polarity?

437
00:16:29.056 --> 00:16:32.756
A polarity is opposites which coexist.

438
00:16:32.756 --> 00:16:34.296
Left is the opposite of right.

439
00:16:34.296 --> 00:16:36.008
But you can't have left without right.

440
00:16:36.008 --> 00:16:37.567
They're opposites which coexist.

441
00:16:37.567 --> 00:16:40.308
They're two and one at the same time.

442
00:16:40.308 --> 00:16:41.107
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

443
00:16:41.107 --> 00:16:43.344
<v ->And this is two and one at the same time.</v>

444
00:16:43.344 --> 00:16:45.325
And we don't have to prejudice one over the other

445
00:16:45.325 --> 00:16:46.944
because they're the same thing.

446
00:16:46.944 --> 00:16:50.105
In the Buddhist tradition, Samsara is Nirvana,

447
00:16:50.105 --> 00:16:53.315
Nirvana is Samsara, it's the final place you end up.

448
00:16:53.315 --> 00:16:54.404
These are the same thing.

449
00:16:54.404 --> 00:16:55.985
The emptiness is the fullness.

450
00:16:55.985 --> 00:16:59.225
The dreamer is the dream, the dream is the dreamer.

451
00:16:59.225 --> 00:17:03.203
And so nonduality becomes actually both/and

452
00:17:03.203 --> 00:17:04.803
not either/or.

453
00:17:04.803 --> 00:17:08.003
But an awful lot of nonduality gets stuck in either/or.

454
00:17:08.003 --> 00:17:09.782
It's either one or it's not.

455
00:17:09.782 --> 00:17:10.743
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

456
00:17:10.743 --> 00:17:12.863
<v ->But it's one expressing itself as many</v>

457
00:17:12.863 --> 00:17:15.182
which is both, clearly.

458
00:17:15.182 --> 00:17:16.000
Isn't it?

459
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.599
It's absolutely clear that this is all separate.

460
00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:20.599
But come back here and it's crystal clear

461
00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:23.039
that it's also a one.

462
00:17:23.039 --> 00:17:24.980
So we don't have to choose between these,

463
00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.620
and attempting to choose will make life very difficult.

464
00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:28.440
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

465
00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.416
<v ->Because you spend your whole time trying</v>

466
00:17:29.416 --> 00:17:31.476
to get rid of something you could never get rid of.

467
00:17:31.476 --> 00:17:33.036
So you're constantly striving to arrive

468
00:17:33.036 --> 00:17:36.174
at your own enlightenment that you could never reach.

469
00:17:36.174 --> 00:17:39.773
Rather than just seeing the majesty of our predicament.

470
00:17:39.773 --> 00:17:44.073
There's what we are which is perfect, and expansive,

471
00:17:44.073 --> 00:17:47.393
and loving, and then there's this limited expression

472
00:17:47.393 --> 00:17:51.453
which is vulnerable and poignant and caught in a world

473
00:17:51.453 --> 00:17:54.514
of joy and suffering, beauty and cruelty,

474
00:17:54.514 --> 00:17:57.334
life and death, all of those polarities

475
00:17:57.334 --> 00:18:00.371
and we dance our way through those polarities.

476
00:18:00.371 --> 00:18:01.331
<v Voiceover>Very true.</v>

477
00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:02.952
And there've been the work of a few people

478
00:18:02.952 --> 00:18:05.298
that come to mind when you're saying that.

479
00:18:07.928 --> 00:18:10.649
This notion that to be in the flesh,

480
00:18:10.649 --> 00:18:12.988
to be in this third degree of density,

481
00:18:12.988 --> 00:18:16.809
I mean I look at it as a multidimensional life experience.

482
00:18:16.809 --> 00:18:19.449
And to be in this third degree density

483
00:18:19.449 --> 00:18:23.168
is the ignorant part, it's the troublesome part

484
00:18:23.168 --> 00:18:27.289
of the whole thing, it's the Tim factor, right?

485
00:18:27.289 --> 00:18:30.188
Or the Regina factor, whomever factor.

486
00:18:30.188 --> 00:18:33.288
Amit Goswami who was also here a couple of days ago,

487
00:18:33.288 --> 00:18:36.188
I think even yesterday, and one of his more recent books,

488
00:18:36.188 --> 00:18:40.609
"Physics of the Soul" is saying, yes, but it's through

489
00:18:40.609 --> 00:18:44.619
this physicality, this third dimensional density

490
00:18:44.619 --> 00:18:48.742
and reality that we can actually begin to apply

491
00:18:48.742 --> 00:18:52.663
and you put into effect the things that we know,

492
00:18:52.663 --> 00:18:55.102
we learn, we feel, we believe and we think.

493
00:18:55.102 --> 00:18:57.303
These other finer densities, these awareness,

494
00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:59.842
are really more fields to potential as it were

495
00:18:59.842 --> 00:19:02.317
but this is where it plays out.

496
00:19:02.317 --> 00:19:05.112
<v ->And it's very pleasurable as well, isn't it?</v>

497
00:19:06.722 --> 00:19:08.529
"Oh, it's kinda good here."

498
00:19:08.529 --> 00:19:10.329
If once you can relax into it

499
00:19:10.329 --> 00:19:12.770
and enter into it just to breath is just

500
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.150
the most fabulously pleasurable experience.

501
00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:15.989
<v Voiceover>It really is.</v>

502
00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:18.647
Just breathing, just looking at a sunrise or a sunset.

503
00:19:18.647 --> 00:19:21.643
However, when you listen to a lot of people;

504
00:19:21.643 --> 00:19:24.184
many, many people that I ran into say,

505
00:19:24.184 --> 00:19:26.484
"I hope this is the last time for me."

506
00:19:26.484 --> 00:19:27.743
<v ->I did.</v>

507
00:19:27.743 --> 00:19:29.376
<v Voiceover>I know, I've never understood that.</v>

508
00:19:29.376 --> 00:19:30.417
<v ->Oh I had it, I do.</v>

509
00:19:30.417 --> 00:19:32.726
I had it in my twenties.

510
00:19:32.726 --> 00:19:35.813
I felt so alienated at one point and it was like,

511
00:19:35.813 --> 00:19:37.794
and the world is mad as well as beautiful, isn't it?

512
00:19:37.794 --> 00:19:38.941
I mean, I still feel that.

513
00:19:38.941 --> 00:19:41.039
It's completely crazy, full of mad people

514
00:19:41.039 --> 00:19:42.199
doing mad things.

515
00:19:42.199 --> 00:19:43.839
And you say, "God, get me out of here."

516
00:19:43.839 --> 00:19:45.917
"This is the wrong place."

517
00:19:45.917 --> 00:19:47.808
And the suffering is horrendous.

518
00:19:47.808 --> 00:19:48.994
I hate suffering.

519
00:19:48.994 --> 00:19:50.994
I hate it myself, I hate seeing it in others.

520
00:19:50.994 --> 00:19:52.071
When you see all of that and you just think,

521
00:19:52.071 --> 00:19:53.871
"Get me out of here."

522
00:19:53.871 --> 00:19:55.631
But the irony for me is that what's happened

523
00:19:55.631 --> 00:19:56.688
in my attempt to get out of here

524
00:19:56.688 --> 00:19:58.989
I've fallen in love with love.

525
00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:00.352
<v Voiceover>See, now that's beautiful.</v>

526
00:20:00.352 --> 00:20:03.692
And I'm wondering if, I don't mean to be divisive

527
00:20:03.692 --> 00:20:08.332
and dualistic in this particular perspective.

528
00:20:08.332 --> 00:20:11.352
But I'm wondering often if that might,

529
00:20:11.352 --> 00:20:12.772
there might be more of a burden

530
00:20:12.772 --> 00:20:17.134
on the male aspect of ourselves

531
00:20:17.134 --> 00:20:18.734
that creates this,

532
00:20:18.734 --> 00:20:21.074
this unique kind of suffering.

533
00:20:21.074 --> 00:20:23.514
I don't hear this often from women saying,

534
00:20:23.514 --> 00:20:25.454
"Oh, I can't wait to get out of here."

535
00:20:25.454 --> 00:20:27.665
<v ->Well if you look at it archetypally and of course</v>

536
00:20:27.665 --> 00:20:28.917
you know these are archetypes--

537
00:20:28.917 --> 00:20:30.737
<v Voiceover>So if we can look at the male/female--</v>

538
00:20:30.737 --> 00:20:31.837
<v ->If you look at it archetypally,</v>

539
00:20:31.837 --> 00:20:34.155
I mean, if I go back to the ancient world

540
00:20:34.155 --> 00:20:37.395
where they talked about everything in terms of archetypes:

541
00:20:37.395 --> 00:20:39.055
of god and goddess

542
00:20:39.055 --> 00:20:41.153
then this story which I've been expressing

543
00:20:41.153 --> 00:20:43.911
in the Modern Indian would be there is God

544
00:20:43.911 --> 00:20:46.391
who is the great mystery, the big maj,

545
00:20:46.391 --> 00:20:49.062
the awareness within which everything is arising.

546
00:20:49.062 --> 00:20:53.902
But to know itself, it dreams the dream of life,

547
00:20:53.902 --> 00:20:57.283
and the dream of life is the feminine, it's the goddess.

548
00:20:57.283 --> 00:20:59.143
This is her, everything, every taste,

549
00:20:59.143 --> 00:21:03.946
every form, every thought, everything,

550
00:21:03.946 --> 00:21:07.876
the whole richness, the color, the particularity is her.

551
00:21:11.766 --> 00:21:13.686
It's like God looks in a mirror and sees himself

552
00:21:13.686 --> 00:21:17.066
as his opposite, so the essence becomes the forms.

553
00:21:17.066 --> 00:21:20.426
And what's happened is that we've had a long period

554
00:21:20.426 --> 00:21:23.347
of spirituality being dominated by men

555
00:21:23.347 --> 00:21:24.827
who've gone or get rid of the feminine.

556
00:21:24.827 --> 00:21:26.207
If you wanna get back to the essence

557
00:21:26.207 --> 00:21:30.047
get rid of pleasure, sex, children,

558
00:21:30.047 --> 00:21:32.237
the enjoyment, the forms.

559
00:21:33.247 --> 00:21:35.168
Get rid of this illusion.

560
00:21:35.168 --> 00:21:36.209
<v Voiceover>And stay as a clean,</v>

561
00:21:36.209 --> 00:21:38.149
pure field of potential, I suppose.

562
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:40.350
<v ->And all of that is archetypally male.</v>

563
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:42.510
Live up a mansion, in a cave,

564
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.271
or with a whole lot of other guys.

565
00:21:44.271 --> 00:21:45.431
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

566
00:21:45.431 --> 00:21:49.991
<v ->And what's happened is with science, actually,</v>

567
00:21:49.991 --> 00:21:51.631
which is often seen as a very male thing,

568
00:21:51.631 --> 00:21:53.911
but again archetypally what's happened in science

569
00:21:53.911 --> 00:21:55.152
is that human beings have gone,

570
00:21:55.152 --> 00:21:57.412
you know what let's listen to her,

571
00:21:57.412 --> 00:21:59.792
let's look at the forms, let's ask mother nature

572
00:21:59.792 --> 00:22:02.852
the way she works, let's stop reading about it in a book

573
00:22:02.852 --> 00:22:05.632
and actually see the way it actually is.

574
00:22:05.632 --> 00:22:08.992
So in a way it's a rediscovery of the goddess,

575
00:22:08.992 --> 00:22:11.813
the feminine, and from that come this whole new world

576
00:22:11.813 --> 00:22:15.013
in which now you and I are loving this experience

577
00:22:15.013 --> 00:22:17.153
where we're eating the best.

578
00:22:17.153 --> 00:22:20.533
We've made life much better through doing this.

579
00:22:20.533 --> 00:22:23.113
And now we're in a position, I think, where we're going,

580
00:22:23.113 --> 00:22:24.254
"Do you know what?

581
00:22:24.254 --> 00:22:25.994
"Do we want to get rid of this

582
00:22:25.994 --> 00:22:30.114
"or do we want to be free to be in this?"

583
00:22:30.114 --> 00:22:32.374
And what the awakening does now, I think,

584
00:22:32.374 --> 00:22:34.594
can free us to embrace both the essence,

585
00:22:34.594 --> 00:22:36.554
the male archetype, and the appearance,

586
00:22:36.554 --> 00:22:37.994
the female archetype.

587
00:22:37.994 --> 00:22:40.514
And actually love the appearances.

588
00:22:40.514 --> 00:22:43.894
And what is so beautiful about this big love

589
00:22:43.894 --> 00:22:47.235
is it can embrace the joy and the suffering, both.

590
00:22:47.235 --> 00:22:48.996
It's not likely.

591
00:22:48.996 --> 00:22:51.736
Some of it's likeable, some of it's horrible,

592
00:22:51.736 --> 00:22:53.536
but this love can hold both.

593
00:22:53.536 --> 00:22:55.344
It's big enough to take the heart break

594
00:22:55.344 --> 00:22:57.086
as well as the ecstasy.

595
00:22:57.086 --> 00:22:58.227
<v Voiceover>So how do you see this</v>

596
00:22:58.227 --> 00:22:59.427
in the context of where we are,

597
00:22:59.427 --> 00:23:00.987
Science and Nonduality?

598
00:23:00.987 --> 00:23:02.847
We're at a Science and Nonduality Conference.

599
00:23:02.847 --> 00:23:04.487
<v ->I think what's happening is that,</v>

600
00:23:04.487 --> 00:23:06.448
again it's a polarity.

601
00:23:06.448 --> 00:23:09.389
What I love about scientists is that they're human beings

602
00:23:09.389 --> 00:23:12.649
and very meticulously have gone out into the appearances

603
00:23:12.649 --> 00:23:15.169
and go, "What is this?"

604
00:23:15.169 --> 00:23:16.749
And then they go, "Well it looks like this,

605
00:23:16.749 --> 00:23:18.109
"but what is it really?"

606
00:23:18.109 --> 00:23:19.649
And they've looked really, really closely and go on,

607
00:23:19.649 --> 00:23:21.849
"Hey guys, it's not there.

608
00:23:21.849 --> 00:23:22.870
"It's all just kind of--

609
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:23.391
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

610
00:23:23.391 --> 00:23:24.633
that's more what you hear than anything.

611
00:23:24.633 --> 00:23:26.973
If you go into the deep physics of it

612
00:23:26.973 --> 00:23:28.714
in the various lectures we've looked

613
00:23:28.714 --> 00:23:30.054
and it's not there.

614
00:23:30.054 --> 00:23:31.215
<v ->Oh it's true.</v>

615
00:23:31.215 --> 00:23:34.135
Most people think science is materialism.

616
00:23:34.135 --> 00:23:37.767
Science has disproved materialism 100 years ago, more.

617
00:23:37.767 --> 00:23:38.806
That's gone.

618
00:23:38.806 --> 00:23:39.446
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

619
00:23:39.446 --> 00:23:42.342
<v ->Scientists are doing, or physics is at least.</v>

620
00:23:42.342 --> 00:23:43.442
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

621
00:23:43.442 --> 00:23:45.898
<v ->Other scientists are trailing behind a bit</v>

622
00:23:45.898 --> 00:23:47.256
but physics on the cutting edge--

623
00:23:47.256 --> 00:23:48.956
<v Voiceover>I mean, this really is what's proving out</v>

624
00:23:48.956 --> 00:23:51.339
the very thing that you're speaking about.

625
00:23:51.339 --> 00:23:53.940
<v ->So they've done that objectively.</v>

626
00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:58.181
What Gnostics, mystics, explorers of consciousness do

627
00:23:58.181 --> 00:24:01.281
is they go, "Who am I?"

628
00:24:01.281 --> 00:24:02.721
And the scientists go, "What is this?"

629
00:24:02.721 --> 00:24:03.681
And they go, "Who am I?"

630
00:24:03.681 --> 00:24:06.181
And they're coming back into the subject,

631
00:24:06.181 --> 00:24:07.921
"Am I what I think I am?"

632
00:24:07.921 --> 00:24:10.321
"Oh my God no, I'm the whole thing.

633
00:24:10.321 --> 00:24:11.781
"I think nothing's what I thought it was.

634
00:24:11.781 --> 00:24:13.721
"It doesn't really exist."

635
00:24:13.721 --> 00:24:17.242
And you hear the same conclusion from these two

636
00:24:17.242 --> 00:24:18.763
completely opposite perspectives.

637
00:24:18.763 --> 00:24:19.803
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

638
00:24:19.803 --> 00:24:21.104
<v ->And again, if I go back to my studies</v>

639
00:24:21.104 --> 00:24:24.464
in the ancient world, there was a time when these two

640
00:24:24.464 --> 00:24:26.884
were not distinguished; they were the same thing,

641
00:24:26.884 --> 00:24:28.904
the scientists and the Gnostics were the same thing.

642
00:24:28.904 --> 00:24:32.244
What I love, Gnostic is Greek for knower,

643
00:24:32.244 --> 00:24:34.425
and scientist is Latin for knower.

644
00:24:34.425 --> 00:24:35.885
<v Voiceover>There you go.</v>

645
00:24:35.885 --> 00:24:38.285
<v ->They're studying the gnosis, the knowledge;</v>

646
00:24:38.285 --> 00:24:40.386
the science is science, the knowledge.

647
00:24:40.386 --> 00:24:42.166
These are the same things.

648
00:24:42.166 --> 00:24:45.606
And they're really just the two complementary perspectives

649
00:24:45.606 --> 00:24:47.426
on this moment.

650
00:24:47.426 --> 00:24:49.067
<v Voiceover>And it is encouraging to see</v>

651
00:24:49.067 --> 00:24:51.207
for the first time at this conference in particular,

652
00:24:51.207 --> 00:24:52.667
I think this is the only one I've been to

653
00:24:52.667 --> 00:24:54.887
where it seems to be more male dominant

654
00:24:54.887 --> 00:24:57.487
in the attendees than female.

655
00:24:57.487 --> 00:24:59.007
Ten years ago, 15 years ago,

656
00:24:59.007 --> 00:25:01.267
when these kinds of conferences began

657
00:25:01.267 --> 00:25:03.367
you would see a male head or two in the room,

658
00:25:03.367 --> 00:25:06.328
it was mostly female attendees.

659
00:25:06.328 --> 00:25:11.200
<v ->What I love about the stuff I do is,</v>

660
00:25:12.608 --> 00:25:15.180
always, there's equal men and women.

661
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:20.490
Everything, whether evenings, days, weekends.

662
00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:23.590
And I think it's because we need to address

663
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:25.320
the head and the heart.

664
00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:31.370
We need the clarity of the thought and that can open up

665
00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:34.450
this experience of oneness and love,

666
00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:36.210
so that we can end up just dissolving

667
00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:38.350
into this love together and going,

668
00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:41.190
"I don't know what's going on, but I love it."

669
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:42.070
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

670
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:44.850
<v ->But to arrive there you have to be able to also go,</v>

671
00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:47.810
"No, we don't need," again don't reject the rational mind.

672
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:49.175
If you don't think you won't be enlightened,

673
00:25:49.175 --> 00:25:50.975
you'll be stupid

674
00:25:50.975 --> 00:25:51.616
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

675
00:25:51.616 --> 00:25:54.536
<v ->Let's think and feel, let's intuit as well,</v>

676
00:25:54.536 --> 00:25:58.096
let's be all that we are and that seems obvious to me.

677
00:25:58.096 --> 00:25:59.836
Look, we're all of this let's just consciously be

678
00:25:59.836 --> 00:26:00.996
what we are.

679
00:26:00.996 --> 00:26:02.336
<v Voiceover>There's no one keeping score.</v>

680
00:26:02.336 --> 00:26:03.997
I mean, I think that we all have this sense,

681
00:26:03.997 --> 00:26:06.278
someone's keeping score of our lives on some level.

682
00:26:06.278 --> 00:26:07.298
<v ->"Have you done well, Tim?"</v>

683
00:26:07.298 --> 00:26:09.338
"Oh disappointing, disappointing."

684
00:26:09.338 --> 00:26:11.498
<v Voiceover>A lot of disappointings over there, eh?</v>

685
00:26:11.498 --> 00:26:14.458
Let's talk about the experience of what you do.

686
00:26:14.458 --> 00:26:17.939
Because I've heard you speaking about

687
00:26:17.939 --> 00:26:20.359
how you perceive life.

688
00:26:20.359 --> 00:26:23.819
But when someone comes to a workshop with you for example,

689
00:26:23.819 --> 00:26:25.759
how do you impart the experience?

690
00:26:25.759 --> 00:26:26.840
So you can give just a little taste.

691
00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:27.940
<v ->Experience?</v>

692
00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:32.330
What I'm doing is so simple it can sound like nothing.

693
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.280
I was just on a day in San Francisco yesterday,

694
00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.281
every single person went through to the Big Love

695
00:26:38.281 --> 00:26:39.561
without exception.

696
00:26:39.561 --> 00:26:40.502
<v Voiceover>Every person went where?</v>

697
00:26:40.502 --> 00:26:41.763
<v ->To the Big Love, to the one oneness</v>

698
00:26:41.763 --> 00:26:43.144
and the Big Love.

699
00:26:43.144 --> 00:26:47.905
And that's not an opinion because it's embodied.

700
00:26:47.905 --> 00:26:50.905
They know it, 'cause it's in you.

701
00:26:50.905 --> 00:26:53.125
You just can't miss it, you feel it

702
00:26:53.125 --> 00:26:55.025
and you feel it with the others there.

703
00:26:55.025 --> 00:26:59.480
And my method is to clarify things as briefly

704
00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.920
and as clearly as I can with ideas.

705
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.340
And then to do very simple things,

706
00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:06.360
like I will get people to sit, become conscious

707
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.119
of the moment, the richness of their experience,

708
00:27:09.119 --> 00:27:11.520
really into it, really into it.

709
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.480
See how amazing it is to feel, and think, and listen,

710
00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.540
and then to become conscious

711
00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:18.920
of what's witnessing all of that.

712
00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.598
And then as you do that you become conscious

713
00:27:20.598 --> 00:27:23.678
of this oceanic presence of awareness.

714
00:27:24.674 --> 00:27:27.394
And then from there, to just open their eyes

715
00:27:27.394 --> 00:27:29.214
and do what we're doing, to just look in the eyes

716
00:27:29.214 --> 00:27:31.654
of another person.

717
00:27:31.654 --> 00:27:34.154
And when you look in somebody eyes you go,

718
00:27:34.154 --> 00:27:36.790
"I can see a beautiful face,

719
00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:38.900
"but I can't see awareness."

720
00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:42.450
I can look through that eye, literally that whole,

721
00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:43.970
and what am I connecting with?

722
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:46.908
So I am this presence of awareness, this mystery

723
00:27:46.908 --> 00:27:49.428
connecting through the forms

724
00:27:49.428 --> 00:27:50.986
with the presence of awareness.

725
00:27:50.986 --> 00:27:51.826
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

726
00:27:51.826 --> 00:27:55.446
<v ->If you're conscious enough as you do that,</v>

727
00:27:55.446 --> 00:27:58.526
suddenly you're one and two at the same time.

728
00:27:58.526 --> 00:27:59.544
And that's awesome.

729
00:27:59.544 --> 00:28:01.464
And you can do that through listening

730
00:28:01.464 --> 00:28:03.784
and through just touching fingers,

731
00:28:03.784 --> 00:28:05.424
and you can do it collectively together

732
00:28:05.424 --> 00:28:06.862
or you can do it with one person

733
00:28:06.862 --> 00:28:09.242
and it's utilizing things we're doing all the time:

734
00:28:09.242 --> 00:28:11.842
we look at people all the time, we listen all the time,

735
00:28:11.842 --> 00:28:13.462
we touch all the time.

736
00:28:13.462 --> 00:28:15.022
But to do it without consciousness

737
00:28:15.022 --> 00:28:16.952
suddenly it wakes you up.

738
00:28:18.222 --> 00:28:22.078
<v Voiceover>What kind of effects has it had on people,</v>

739
00:28:22.078 --> 00:28:24.458
at least as you've been able to keep tabs

740
00:28:24.458 --> 00:28:27.638
through the years, what kind of lasting effects

741
00:28:27.638 --> 00:28:29.318
does this experience have?

742
00:28:29.318 --> 00:28:31.558
<v ->It's been a real privilege now to see people</v>

743
00:28:31.558 --> 00:28:35.438
who have been touching along this with me,

744
00:28:35.438 --> 00:28:38.058
but when I say that don't be misled.

745
00:28:39.816 --> 00:28:41.636
It's not about me.

746
00:28:41.636 --> 00:28:44.276
It's more like what I see with people that I travel with

747
00:28:44.276 --> 00:28:46.012
it's like an explorer's club.

748
00:28:46.012 --> 00:28:47.986
My job is to be like a (mumbles).

749
00:28:47.986 --> 00:28:51.566
I do this, I don't know why I do this, but I do this.

750
00:28:51.566 --> 00:28:54.366
And I know that if I enter deeply into this place

751
00:28:54.366 --> 00:28:57.146
people around me start entering into it too

752
00:28:57.146 --> 00:28:58.462
and that's great.

753
00:28:58.462 --> 00:28:59.762
And that's my role.

754
00:28:59.762 --> 00:29:01.762
There's nothing special about that whatsoever,

755
00:29:01.762 --> 00:29:03.002
it's just my role.

756
00:29:03.002 --> 00:29:04.802
And people do it themselves

757
00:29:04.802 --> 00:29:05.982
when they're exploring themselves,

758
00:29:05.982 --> 00:29:08.902
but as they do it lives are transformed.

759
00:29:08.902 --> 00:29:12.602
I mean, I'm a very lucky person because I get to witness

760
00:29:12.602 --> 00:29:15.562
and I get a lot of appreciation for that

761
00:29:15.562 --> 00:29:18.402
and I appreciate that appreciation

762
00:29:18.402 --> 00:29:21.932
that people's lives can be so profoundly changed.

763
00:29:23.976 --> 00:29:25.976
'Cause there's a place to go where you witness

764
00:29:25.976 --> 00:29:28.576
oneness and love, and that's the only thing

765
00:29:28.576 --> 00:29:30.416
which can fill the hole.

766
00:29:30.416 --> 00:29:32.134
<v Voiceover>And you don't try to avoid,</v>

767
00:29:32.134 --> 00:29:34.734
as we talked about it a little bit ago,

768
00:29:34.734 --> 00:29:39.734
you don't try to avoid or put a qualitative type of lens

769
00:29:40.234 --> 00:29:44.792
on the experience you have as you said yesterday,

770
00:29:44.792 --> 00:29:46.832
or perhaps the day before now,

771
00:29:46.832 --> 00:29:48.692
you want to feel your heart break.

772
00:29:48.692 --> 00:29:49.010
<v ->Yes.</v>

773
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:50.228
<v Voiceover>This isn't about not feeling.</v>

774
00:29:50.228 --> 00:29:52.908
Many, many people seem to flee to the world

775
00:29:52.908 --> 00:29:55.808
of metaphysics and spirituality

776
00:29:55.808 --> 00:29:57.588
so that the pain isn't there anymore.

777
00:29:57.588 --> 00:30:01.828
<v ->Yes, I mean for me, right now as we're speaking,</v>

778
00:30:01.828 --> 00:30:03.588
my father is dying.

779
00:30:03.588 --> 00:30:07.018
And I very nearly didn't come to this conference.

780
00:30:08.388 --> 00:30:11.498
I made the decision that I would, encouraged by mother.

781
00:30:13.448 --> 00:30:17.078
But he's lying in a bed, he can move his left hand,

782
00:30:18.008 --> 00:30:21.408
nothing else, and he is very distressed,

783
00:30:21.408 --> 00:30:22.428
and he's calling out for help,

784
00:30:22.428 --> 00:30:23.648
and he doesn't know where he is.

785
00:30:26.286 --> 00:30:29.526
Now I don't want to be in the position

786
00:30:29.526 --> 00:30:31.646
where that doesn't move me,

787
00:30:31.646 --> 00:30:34.256
because if that happens I have lost my humanity.

788
00:30:35.704 --> 00:30:37.034
I hate it.

789
00:30:38.284 --> 00:30:41.494
I hate that he's suffering and it makes me suffer.

790
00:30:42.344 --> 00:30:44.824
But the loss would be worse,

791
00:30:44.824 --> 00:30:46.944
because what I don't want is numbness.

792
00:30:46.944 --> 00:30:50.124
I want to feel and be human,

793
00:30:50.124 --> 00:30:52.144
but I don't wanna be overwhelmed by that.

794
00:30:52.144 --> 00:30:54.084
And if I just come into my separateness

795
00:30:54.084 --> 00:30:55.964
it is overwhelming, I can't bear it.

796
00:30:55.964 --> 00:30:57.564
It's too much for me.

797
00:30:57.564 --> 00:30:59.124
Just my father suffering that the knowledge

798
00:30:59.124 --> 00:31:01.664
that he's just one person amongst millions of people

799
00:31:01.664 --> 00:31:03.294
who are suffering right now.

800
00:31:05.704 --> 00:31:08.504
And yet if I come back to that big space

801
00:31:08.504 --> 00:31:11.544
what I am, what we really are,

802
00:31:11.544 --> 00:31:14.042
that can only bear (mumbles).

803
00:31:14.042 --> 00:31:15.746
It's holding all of it within it.

804
00:31:16.716 --> 00:31:20.236
And there's a fundamental okayness

805
00:31:20.236 --> 00:31:21.916
even when it's not okay.

806
00:31:24.272 --> 00:31:25.672
There's poignancy.

807
00:31:25.672 --> 00:31:29.012
I see that this love celebrates when it's good

808
00:31:29.012 --> 00:31:30.312
which you actually appreciate it

809
00:31:30.312 --> 00:31:34.586
which (mumbles) and it brings this poignancy

810
00:31:34.586 --> 00:31:37.166
to when it's terrible.

811
00:31:37.166 --> 00:31:40.526
There is also that love and that meeting,

812
00:31:40.526 --> 00:31:43.724
and it's bittersweet.

813
00:31:43.724 --> 00:31:46.924
And for me to let go of that,

814
00:31:46.924 --> 00:31:50.464
which I thought to not be attached,

815
00:31:50.464 --> 00:31:52.514
what, to not be attached?

816
00:31:53.404 --> 00:31:55.104
But is it either/or, is it a choice,

817
00:31:55.104 --> 00:31:56.604
or can it be both/and?

818
00:31:56.604 --> 00:32:00.364
Here, I'm not attached, never could be, never will be.

819
00:32:00.364 --> 00:32:03.714
Just like in a dream, it's okay, it doesn't matter.

820
00:32:04.684 --> 00:32:06.304
Here it matters.

821
00:32:06.304 --> 00:32:07.525
<v Voiceover>Is it fair to say then that the</v>

822
00:32:07.525 --> 00:32:11.505
art of lucid living is to be able to expand out

823
00:32:11.505 --> 00:32:13.765
into that oneness awareness,

824
00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:18.625
and to be able, simultaneously, or to at least be able

825
00:32:18.625 --> 00:32:21.785
to easily traverse between the two;

826
00:32:21.785 --> 00:32:23.865
be fully engaged in the human experience?

827
00:32:23.865 --> 00:32:25.965
<v ->Yeah, beautiful point, beautiful.</v>

828
00:32:25.965 --> 00:32:28.405
'Cause for me the great paradox is being

829
00:32:28.405 --> 00:32:31.985
the more I come out, the more I can come in.

830
00:32:31.985 --> 00:32:35.045
Because actually, I think we can spend an awful lot

831
00:32:35.045 --> 00:32:36.765
of our lives, I know I have,

832
00:32:36.765 --> 00:32:39.307
being too frightened to come in.

833
00:32:39.307 --> 00:32:42.547
But when there's this knowledge of what the Gnostics

834
00:32:42.547 --> 00:32:46.168
call your unbornness; what we are can't ever die

835
00:32:46.168 --> 00:32:51.168
is never born, the dreamer outside the dream,

836
00:32:51.289 --> 00:32:54.149
then I'm free to enter in, to actually engage

837
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:56.529
with the richness of the drama,

838
00:32:56.529 --> 00:33:00.469
to play my little part in this vast pageant,

839
00:33:00.469 --> 00:33:04.909
and to be beat him, to try that out.

840
00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:07.489
And more than anything I wanna see us do that

841
00:33:07.489 --> 00:33:10.249
as individuals, to know that who we are,

842
00:33:10.249 --> 00:33:13.029
to find the oneness, experience the love,

843
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:16.185
and then to really commit to being who we happen to be

844
00:33:16.185 --> 00:33:19.356
and to play some part in waking us up collectively.

845
00:33:20.486 --> 00:33:23.006
<v Voiceover>To revel in a role, revel in our passions.</v>

846
00:33:23.006 --> 00:33:24.086
<v ->Whatever it is.</v>

847
00:33:24.086 --> 00:33:26.626
It can be something which seem small,

848
00:33:26.626 --> 00:33:27.866
it can be just a child.

849
00:33:27.866 --> 00:33:28.224
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

850
00:33:28.224 --> 00:33:28.984
<v ->Just.</v>

851
00:33:28.984 --> 00:33:29.505
<v Voiceover>Yeah, just.</v>

852
00:33:29.505 --> 00:33:30.725
<v ->Because it's huge, isn't it?</v>

853
00:33:30.725 --> 00:33:31.406
What could be bigger?

854
00:33:31.406 --> 00:33:32.597
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

855
00:33:34.748 --> 00:33:38.468
<v ->I mean, when you reach lots and lots of people</v>

856
00:33:38.468 --> 00:33:41.168
through books and film and things like that

857
00:33:41.168 --> 00:33:46.150
you compare to what the effects they have on your child.

858
00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:47.110
It's nothing.

859
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:48.210
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

860
00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:48.950
<v ->It's nothing.</v>

861
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:50.551
<v Voiceover>Ditto, I will say that's true.</v>

862
00:33:50.551 --> 00:33:52.554
<v ->So whatever we're doing, I have this thing,</v>

863
00:33:52.554 --> 00:33:55.254
we can be ambassadors for oneness.

864
00:33:55.254 --> 00:33:56.654
There's the state of oneness

865
00:33:56.654 --> 00:33:57.855
and we're an ambassador for it.

866
00:33:57.855 --> 00:33:58.615
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

867
00:33:58.615 --> 00:34:03.275
<v ->And if that sounds too grand, being an ambassador,</v>

868
00:34:03.275 --> 00:34:04.835
you can be a secret agent for love.

869
00:34:04.835 --> 00:34:06.455
(laughter)

870
00:34:06.455 --> 00:34:08.055
And no one will know you're doing it,

871
00:34:08.055 --> 00:34:09.475
apart from other secret agents.

872
00:34:09.475 --> 00:34:12.535
You'll go, "You're a secret agent for love, right?"

873
00:34:12.535 --> 00:34:13.717
And there's a lot of those.

874
00:34:13.717 --> 00:34:14.477
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

875
00:34:14.477 --> 00:34:17.177
<v ->We need a lot of those.</v>

876
00:34:17.177 --> 00:34:18.667
<v Voiceover>Any final thoughts?</v>

877
00:34:20.697 --> 00:34:21.977
(clears throat)

878
00:34:21.977 --> 00:34:25.677
<v ->Well, I think the journey is taking me to this place</v>

879
00:34:25.677 --> 00:34:29.457
where I finally, it's been a hard journey,

880
00:34:29.457 --> 00:34:32.067
I really conclusively know that I know nothing.

881
00:34:33.678 --> 00:34:36.498
For a long time I thought I probably knew nothing,

882
00:34:36.498 --> 00:34:40.418
now I know I know nothing and I'm pleased about that.

883
00:34:40.418 --> 00:34:41.318
<v Voiceover>Is it freeing?</v>

884
00:34:41.318 --> 00:34:42.339
<v ->It is.</v>

885
00:34:42.339 --> 00:34:45.559
There is this mystery, and then I have a story,

886
00:34:45.559 --> 00:34:46.719
and we need that.

887
00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:48.319
I have to have that.

888
00:34:48.319 --> 00:34:52.060
If I don't have that I can't live 'cause this is a story.

889
00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.420
The most obvious thing about life, isn't it,

890
00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:57.020
the most obvious thing is not that it's made up of atoms,

891
00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:59.661
the most obvious thing is the story.

892
00:34:59.661 --> 00:35:01.121
That's really obvious.

893
00:35:01.121 --> 00:35:01.543
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

894
00:35:01.543 --> 00:35:03.023
<v ->It's clearly that.</v>

895
00:35:03.023 --> 00:35:05.103
When you go like, "The universe is atoms,"

896
00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:06.423
it's like looking at a movie and going,

897
00:35:06.423 --> 00:35:07.364
"It's just pixels."

898
00:35:07.364 --> 00:35:09.244
It's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it's a story

899
00:35:09.244 --> 00:35:11.594
"first and foremost," and this is a story.

900
00:35:12.724 --> 00:35:14.684
And what we bring to the story,

901
00:35:14.684 --> 00:35:17.344
we don't know what those story is,

902
00:35:17.344 --> 00:35:19.624
we bring our story, and we can share it with each other.

903
00:35:19.624 --> 00:35:21.904
And when we can meet in the humility

904
00:35:21.904 --> 00:35:25.284
and the authenticity of going,

905
00:35:25.284 --> 00:35:27.304
"Wow, I don't know what this is.

906
00:35:27.304 --> 00:35:29.764
"This is what I found, what have you found?"

907
00:35:29.764 --> 00:35:33.694
And share it as equal explorers of the mystery.

908
00:35:34.584 --> 00:35:35.774
I love that.

909
00:35:37.084 --> 00:35:39.304
It'd be really grateful to do that with you today.

910
00:35:39.304 --> 00:35:40.444
<v Voiceover>As have I.</v>

911
00:35:40.444 --> 00:35:41.824
Thank you so much for your time.

912
00:35:41.824 --> 00:35:44.144
I know you're about to bustle off somewhere,

913
00:35:44.144 --> 00:35:46.404
and I really appreciate spending the time with you.

914
00:35:46.404 --> 00:35:48.364
I very much enjoy the chat yesterday,

915
00:35:48.364 --> 00:35:51.984
and that's what drove me to harness you,

916
00:35:51.984 --> 00:35:54.104
well to tackle you (laughs),

917
00:35:54.104 --> 00:35:55.804
to see if we can sit together.

918
00:35:55.804 --> 00:35:57.524
Thank you so much for your time, Tim.

919
00:35:57.524 --> 00:35:58.624
<v ->Thank you.</v>

920
00:35:58.624 --> 00:36:01.124
(upbeat lively music)

921
00:36:01.124 --> 00:36:03.024
<v ->To connect with Tim and one of his workshops,</v>

922
00:36:03.024 --> 00:36:06.204
you can visit his website at timothyfreke.com,

923
00:36:06.204 --> 00:36:08.804
and that's spelled F-R-E-K-E.

924
00:36:08.804 --> 00:36:10.444
And you can purchase all of his books

925
00:36:10.444 --> 00:36:12.704
at Amazon or other major book sellers.

926
00:36:12.704 --> 00:36:15.264
Meanwhile, another philosopher you might enjoy,

927
00:36:15.264 --> 00:36:18.104
if you're not already familiar with him, is Peter Russell.

928
00:36:18.104 --> 00:36:20.744
We have a couple of interviews with Peter on this site.

929
00:36:20.744 --> 00:36:21.764
Until next time.

930
00:36:21.764 --> 00:36:23.314
Thanks for watching CMN.
