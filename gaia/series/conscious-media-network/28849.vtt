(light percussion music)

2
00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:09.382
<v Voiceover>In our last interview,</v>

3
00:00:09.382 --> 00:00:12.201
you kind of dropped a little bombshell on us

4
00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:14.274
that had come through recently from Kirael

5
00:00:14.274 --> 00:00:17.932
about the fact that we have more than one aspect

6
00:00:17.932 --> 00:00:21.675
that's living incarnated at a given time,

7
00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:23.299
and that when this shift happens,

8
00:00:23.299 --> 00:00:24.891
we are going to have a consolidation

9
00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:26.841
of consciousness into one vehicle.

10
00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:28.054
I think, is that a proper way to put it?

11
00:00:28.054 --> 00:00:29.346
<v ->That's fair, yes.</v>

12
00:00:29.346 --> 00:00:32.760
<v Voiceover>That the other aspects of ourself,</v>

13
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.615
those other bodies will poof, somehow go away.

14
00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:40.193
I know that you and I and everybody is gonna have a hard--

15
00:00:40.193 --> 00:00:42.003
We'll be able to think about that forever

16
00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:43.255
to get our minds around it.

17
00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:46.872
So now, let's go ahead and move on

18
00:00:46.872 --> 00:00:50.307
to all of the preparation that's happening even now.

19
00:00:50.307 --> 00:00:53.041
I'm noticing a large amount of energy shifting

20
00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:55.012
in terms of consciousness, personally.

21
00:00:55.962 --> 00:00:57.803
A mild state of euphoria.

22
00:00:58.473 --> 00:01:00.302
Interesting physical sensations.

23
00:01:00.302 --> 00:01:00.932
<v ->Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:00.932 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Voiceover>What is this preparatory stage</v>

25
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.240
that's happening right now,

26
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.040
and I want to go into the photon energy as well.

27
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.365
<v ->Let's face it.</v>

28
00:01:09.365 --> 00:01:12.569
Anybody that's listened to my interview so far

29
00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:13.965
has wanted to come back.

30
00:01:13.965 --> 00:01:17.590
They're already gonna start to understand what I'm saying.

31
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.484
They're gonna believe not what I'm saying,

32
00:01:20.484 --> 00:01:22.592
but they're gonna believe what they have to believe.

33
00:01:22.592 --> 00:01:26.470
For instance, when you talk about the mild euphoria,

34
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.788
this whole journey is our brain is expanding.

35
00:01:29.278 --> 00:01:31.060
Every day.

36
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.491
Some people can--

37
00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:33.651
You know, this whole thing about

38
00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:34.981
where did I leave my car keys,

39
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:36.649
or where did I park my car,

40
00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.853
that's all stuff that you've been brought up to believe in.

41
00:01:39.853 --> 00:01:41.493
If you don't believe in it,

42
00:01:41.493 --> 00:01:43.385
then you've got to believe the other side of it.

43
00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:44.499
You know where your car is.

44
00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:45.913
Just go out there and get it.

45
00:01:45.913 --> 00:01:48.542
You know where your keys are because you put it there.

46
00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:49.980
This whole journey is about,

47
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.154
this whole thing with my brain,

48
00:01:52.154 --> 00:01:53.906
my brain, your brain, everybody's brain,

49
00:01:53.906 --> 00:01:55.495
but not just a brain,

50
00:01:55.495 --> 00:01:58.982
how about your midriff and things like this.

51
00:01:58.982 --> 00:02:00.779
<v Voiceover>Oh, big changes.</v>
<v ->That's right.</v>

52
00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:03.903
It's absolutely perfect and that's what I'm trying

53
00:02:03.903 --> 00:02:06.138
to get people to get with me right now,

54
00:02:06.138 --> 00:02:09.084
is if they just get positive,

55
00:02:09.084 --> 00:02:11.053
get to a positive mode.

56
00:02:11.053 --> 00:02:12.916
I'm not trying to sell you a positive seminar

57
00:02:12.916 --> 00:02:14.111
because I don't have a seminar,

58
00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:17.127
but the positive is the--

59
00:02:17.127 --> 00:02:19.792
You've only got two choices, negative or positive, right,

60
00:02:19.792 --> 00:02:21.349
because we live in a duality.

61
00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.513
<v Voiceover>Yeah we can flow with it</v>

62
00:02:22.513 --> 00:02:24.017
and thrive through the process

63
00:02:24.017 --> 00:02:26.227
or fight it and whatever comes from that.

64
00:02:26.227 --> 00:02:27.777
<v ->That's right.</v>

65
00:02:27.777 --> 00:02:29.404
That's the whole thing is that most people

66
00:02:29.404 --> 00:02:30.664
are gonna go to the negative.

67
00:02:30.664 --> 00:02:34.362
If you get a little twinge in your shoulder today,

68
00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:36.908
and you're just like, "Oh what is that?"

69
00:02:37.788 --> 00:02:39.972
"Oh God, I better go to the doctor," or whatever.

70
00:02:39.972 --> 00:02:41.527
I don't go see the doctor.

71
00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:44.271
I should more than I do but I'll tell you this,

72
00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:47.234
I know that for me, it's something that I've got to do

73
00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:50.536
to get my body prepared for this shift.

74
00:02:52.026 --> 00:02:53.599
I'm not even sure I'm gonna be there,

75
00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.148
but I'm gonna prepare for it just in case,

76
00:02:56.148 --> 00:02:57.100
this whole journey,

77
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.078
because this whole thing is preparing the body.

78
00:03:00.078 --> 00:03:04.017
Let's suppose that you use,

79
00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.385
you're much higher than 10% brain.

80
00:03:06.385 --> 00:03:07.542
You just know this.

81
00:03:07.542 --> 00:03:10.256
I can tell you, you're probably 18 - 20%.

82
00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:11.494
Somewhere in that neighborhood.

83
00:03:11.494 --> 00:03:12.358
It may be even more.

84
00:03:13.448 --> 00:03:16.360
I don't know, but you know what I'm saying.

85
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.247
This whole journey is about

86
00:03:18.247 --> 00:03:20.130
what are you gonna do with this brain power?

87
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.653
So if you're gonna sit back

88
00:03:22.653 --> 00:03:26.639
and you're gonna cry, boo, boo hoo,

89
00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.380
that's not gonna be the answer for anybody

90
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.025
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

91
00:03:29.025 --> 00:03:30.982
<v ->Nobody's gonna win from that answer,</v>

92
00:03:30.982 --> 00:03:32.387
but if you get something

93
00:03:32.387 --> 00:03:36.274
and you want to really get into what you've just gotten,

94
00:03:36.274 --> 00:03:37.742
this is what you gotta get.

95
00:03:37.742 --> 00:03:40.007
You gotta get to it right now because the whole journey

96
00:03:40.007 --> 00:03:42.041
is about what you and I are gonna do

97
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:44.537
with what we've got right now.

98
00:03:44.537 --> 00:03:48.487
If you're just aiming at what you're gonna get,

99
00:03:48.487 --> 00:03:50.029
you're never gonna get there,

100
00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:51.772
because you know, that's always out there.

101
00:03:51.772 --> 00:03:54.143
What you've got is what you do right now.

102
00:03:54.143 --> 00:03:56.275
In the now is what you've gotta get with,

103
00:03:56.275 --> 00:03:59.041
and that's right what you've got to get for everything.

104
00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:00.511
It doesn't fail.

105
00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:02.239
It never fails you.
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

106
00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.765
There is a huge explosion

107
00:04:05.765 --> 00:04:08.897
of cosmic energy, momentum that is occurring.

108
00:04:08.897 --> 00:04:11.364
I definitely am feeling that

109
00:04:11.364 --> 00:04:14.940
and the greater mind is just so available.

110
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.066
<v ->I talk about this thing called photon energy.</v>

111
00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:21.460
In fact, if they want, they can go into

112
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.232
the site right now and they can see it on there.

113
00:04:24.232 --> 00:04:27.314
There's a photon chart Master Kirael gives us every month.

114
00:04:27.314 --> 00:04:29.024
This whole journey is about,

115
00:04:29.024 --> 00:04:30.805
what you gotta hear me say is

116
00:04:30.805 --> 00:04:33.841
what you feel right now as the sunshine on your head,

117
00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:35.731
it may not be just sunshine.

118
00:04:35.731 --> 00:04:37.771
It may be this photon that we're experiencing,

119
00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:38.383
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

120
00:04:38.383 --> 00:04:40.186
because there's so much within the earth plane.

121
00:04:40.996 --> 00:04:43.865
Gregg Braden told about this 20 years ago.

122
00:04:43.865 --> 00:04:47.472
He talked about this flow of energy coming.

123
00:04:47.472 --> 00:04:49.523
Master Kirael was talking to him for 20 years.

124
00:04:50.753 --> 00:04:52.311
It's always gonna be there,

125
00:04:52.311 --> 00:04:54.824
but right now it's actually palatable to us.

126
00:04:54.824 --> 00:04:56.106
You can actually feel it.

127
00:04:56.106 --> 00:04:58.871
You walk and you feel something on your face.

128
00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:00.030
There's nothing there,

129
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.694
but that's what you're getting right now.

130
00:05:01.694 --> 00:05:02.386
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

131
00:05:03.507 --> 00:05:06.534
The top of the head extremely.

132
00:05:08.254 --> 00:05:09.336
Next time you get something,

133
00:05:09.336 --> 00:05:12.014
see which side it's coming in, right or left side,

134
00:05:12.014 --> 00:05:13.408
because if it's the right side,

135
00:05:13.408 --> 00:05:16.167
it's gonna be more or less like the right brain,

136
00:05:17.477 --> 00:05:19.138
but the left side is gonna get in there

137
00:05:19.138 --> 00:05:20.757
and figure out what it is.

138
00:05:20.757 --> 00:05:23.172
It's really fascinating because I think you're gonna find

139
00:05:23.172 --> 00:05:25.145
more of your stuff is gonna be on the right side

140
00:05:25.145 --> 00:05:27.029
because this is what it's all gonna come to anyway.

141
00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:28.906
Eventually it's gonna all through the right side.

142
00:05:28.906 --> 00:05:30.202
<v Voiceover>I do feel a lot on the right side.</v>

143
00:05:30.202 --> 00:05:32.502
Almost like fingers touching my head a lot of the time,

144
00:05:32.502 --> 00:05:33.778
<v ->Yeah.
<v Voiceover>and all of it.</v>

145
00:05:33.778 --> 00:05:34.859
I'm used to it.

146
00:05:34.859 --> 00:05:37.216
It's been a lot of years, but it's more so now.

147
00:05:37.216 --> 00:05:38.076
<v ->The photon energy.</v>

148
00:05:38.076 --> 00:05:39.908
<v Voiceover>Just the information of every kind</v>

149
00:05:39.908 --> 00:05:42.649
is so effortlessly available is the main thing.

150
00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:46.614
Again, like I said, I think if people understand

151
00:05:46.614 --> 00:05:48.421
that this is all a natural part of it,

152
00:05:48.421 --> 00:05:49.918
then there's nothing to fight.

153
00:05:49.918 --> 00:05:50.747
<v ->That's right</v>

154
00:05:50.747 --> 00:05:52.770
<v Voiceover>For me, it actually,</v>

155
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.112
this last blast that started opening

156
00:05:55.112 --> 00:05:57.990
brought nausea, just mild nausea.

157
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.611
My stomach was weird and it was hard to kind of settle down.

158
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:04.798
Yet, overlaying it, this openness in clarity

159
00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:06.812
in the mind was heightened,

160
00:06:06.812 --> 00:06:10.642
as well as these feelings of euphoria, mild euphoria.

161
00:06:10.642 --> 00:06:13.169
So it's just riding through each part

162
00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:14.986
and witnessing it and not attaching,

163
00:06:14.986 --> 00:06:16.943
because it's going to change again and again, right?

164
00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:18.338
<v ->That's exactly right.</v>

165
00:06:18.338 --> 00:06:22.687
You're talking about being upset in that area.

166
00:06:22.687 --> 00:06:26.239
That whole area right here to here is so powerful

167
00:06:26.239 --> 00:06:28.236
because that's our center of gravity.

168
00:06:28.236 --> 00:06:28.756
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

169
00:06:28.756 --> 00:06:31.244
<v ->Everything on this planet is based around this center.</v>

170
00:06:31.244 --> 00:06:32.641
We've got all this stuff at the top,

171
00:06:32.641 --> 00:06:35.778
but our legs, our little legs are just drawing down.

172
00:06:35.778 --> 00:06:38.580
The whole journey is about what's gonna happen right here.

173
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.818
Our whole body, you have to hear what I'm saying.

174
00:06:40.818 --> 00:06:42.955
<v Voiceover>It's happening in the whole abdomen,</v>

175
00:06:42.955 --> 00:06:44.020
the whole center.

176
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.883
<v ->That's the center of everything.</v>

177
00:06:45.883 --> 00:06:47.069
It's gonna be squished down

178
00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:49.036
and pushed apart and pulled apart.

179
00:06:49.036 --> 00:06:50.289
You're gonna have to get through some pains.

180
00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:52.014
I'm sorry to say but it's alright

181
00:06:52.014 --> 00:06:53.587
because you don't want to lose sleep over it

182
00:06:53.587 --> 00:06:56.245
because it's just gonna be that way.

183
00:06:56.245 --> 00:06:58.532
You just gotta be ok with your nausea or whatever.

184
00:06:58.532 --> 00:06:59.165
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

185
00:06:59.165 --> 00:07:00.341
<v ->It's gonna go away eventually</v>

186
00:07:00.341 --> 00:07:01.853
when you get it all settled out.

187
00:07:01.853 --> 00:07:03.774
You're gonna think what was that all about now?

188
00:07:03.774 --> 00:07:05.377
What difference does it make because it's gone.

189
00:07:05.377 --> 00:07:05.975
<v Voiceover>It doesn't matter.</v>

190
00:07:05.975 --> 00:07:07.341
It was just part of the process.

191
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:08.168
<v ->That's right.</v>

192
00:07:08.168 --> 00:07:09.953
<v Voiceover>So let's talk about photon energy.</v>

193
00:07:09.953 --> 00:07:11.514
When you say photon energy,

194
00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:14.743
is it fair for me to assume that you're talking about,

195
00:07:14.743 --> 00:07:16.945
in eastern traditions what's called prana?

196
00:07:16.945 --> 00:07:17.764
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

197
00:07:17.764 --> 00:07:18.881
<v Voiceover>Ok because I see that</v>

198
00:07:18.881 --> 00:07:20.633
in the morning sometimes, depending on the light.

199
00:07:20.633 --> 00:07:23.381
I thought we wouldn't be able to see anything.

200
00:07:23.381 --> 00:07:24.829
it would be a whiteout if we were all

201
00:07:24.829 --> 00:07:26.280
looking at the prana all the time.

202
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.383
<v ->That's right, that's right.</v>

203
00:07:27.383 --> 00:07:28.736
<v Voiceover>So let's talk about how we</v>

204
00:07:28.736 --> 00:07:30.759
actively use the photon pranic energy.

205
00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:33.464
<v ->Well, I teach something called Signature Cell Healing,</v>

206
00:07:33.464 --> 00:07:37.259
which I'm very proud of because I have a very--

207
00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:40.648
It's a two day seminar, but I'm not trying to sell it.

208
00:07:40.648 --> 00:07:41.564
I'm just telling you.

209
00:07:41.564 --> 00:07:43.399
It's well taught and it's always

210
00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:45.227
going to be based on pranic energy.

211
00:07:45.227 --> 00:07:47.261
The photon energy is gonna be there.

212
00:07:47.261 --> 00:07:49.546
It's always how you're gonna breathe.

213
00:07:49.546 --> 00:07:51.895
Remember what I told you when we did the first interview,

214
00:07:51.895 --> 00:07:55.120
I told you that Master Kuro said, "Breathe laddy, breathe."

215
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.906
<v Voiceover>You breathed life back into yourself'.</v>

216
00:07:56.906 --> 00:07:58.492
You breathed yourself back into your body.

217
00:07:58.492 --> 00:07:59.490
<v ->Exactly.</v>

218
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.764
I didn't feel any breathe when I was up to here.

219
00:08:01.764 --> 00:08:04.679
I didn't notice if I was breathing or not.

220
00:08:04.679 --> 00:08:06.936
I think I was because I wasn't dead.

221
00:08:06.936 --> 00:08:08.499
I was a little bluish, but not blue.

222
00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:11.289
My breathing, this whole journey

223
00:08:11.289 --> 00:08:12.845
right down to the pineal gland

224
00:08:14.455 --> 00:08:17.089
into the thymus and then down to the bone marrows,

225
00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:20.078
everything, all of this energy brought back into my body.

226
00:08:20.078 --> 00:08:23.320
That's why I took such a short recovery time

227
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.894
to get out of this whole journey.

228
00:08:25.644 --> 00:08:27.758
If I didn't have that at that time,

229
00:08:27.758 --> 00:08:29.869
if I just breathe,

230
00:08:31.239 --> 00:08:32.849
you know what I'm saying, that's not gonna work.

231
00:08:32.849 --> 00:08:34.567
You have to breathe deeply.

232
00:08:34.567 --> 00:08:36.093
When you breathe deeply,

233
00:08:36.093 --> 00:08:39.828
first thing, you talk about mild,

234
00:08:41.478 --> 00:08:43.195
feeling that your--
<v Voiceover>Euphoria.</v>

235
00:08:43.195 --> 00:08:44.913
<v ->Thank you, bless you.</v>

236
00:08:44.913 --> 00:08:46.777
Understand this whole journey,

237
00:08:46.777 --> 00:08:48.273
people that over breathe,

238
00:08:48.273 --> 00:08:50.039
and they don't breathe into their body,

239
00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:51.910
then it stays in the head, right.

240
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.502
All that photon energy is only gonna stop in your brain,

241
00:08:54.502 --> 00:08:56.732
and you're not breaking it down in yourself.

242
00:08:56.732 --> 00:08:59.214
That's where you feel that euphoria,

243
00:08:59.214 --> 00:09:02.151
but that's the perfect thing because what you do now

244
00:09:02.151 --> 00:09:04.304
is you pull it from there down through,

245
00:09:04.304 --> 00:09:06.164
and you feel this upset stomach.

246
00:09:06.164 --> 00:09:07.513
Bring it down through here

247
00:09:07.513 --> 00:09:08.862
and bring it right into this upset stomach,

248
00:09:08.862 --> 00:09:11.647
and just immediately watch it go away.

249
00:09:11.647 --> 00:09:13.360
That's all you gotta do is a couple of things

250
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.957
like that right there and you know what you're doing,

251
00:09:15.957 --> 00:09:16.732
and that's the perfect--

252
00:09:16.732 --> 00:09:18.189
<v Voiceover>This is really important information</v>

253
00:09:18.189 --> 00:09:21.974
for everybody that's feeling these sensations already,

254
00:09:21.974 --> 00:09:23.580
and everybody will.

255
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.092
<v ->Oh Yeah.</v>

256
00:09:24.092 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Voiceover>It will show in whatever way,</v>

257
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.220
but this is really important information

258
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.449
to use this energy to, what would you say?

259
00:09:30.449 --> 00:09:32.482
It's almost like, well energize.

260
00:09:32.482 --> 00:09:32.964
<v ->It is.</v>

261
00:09:32.964 --> 00:09:36.980
<v Voiceover>To energize, to infuse with life force.</v>

262
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.332
<v ->So, if you have 50 million people listening</v>

263
00:09:40.332 --> 00:09:42.444
to this thing right now, you gotta know

264
00:09:42.444 --> 00:09:45.613
that 10 million of them, that may be high.

265
00:09:45.613 --> 00:09:47.386
Maybe 5 million are gonna try it.

266
00:09:47.386 --> 00:09:49.132
The other 45 million are gonna go,

267
00:09:49.132 --> 00:09:50.102
"Don't bother with this stuff."

268
00:09:50.102 --> 00:09:51.539
"This guy's crazy."

269
00:09:51.539 --> 00:09:54.246
That's ok because 5 million is all I'm looking for.

270
00:09:54.246 --> 00:09:56.237
You know, because this thing right now,

271
00:09:56.237 --> 00:10:00.111
if you do it right now and you catch that feeling,

272
00:10:00.111 --> 00:10:02.002
and you bring it down through you,

273
00:10:02.002 --> 00:10:05.215
and you breeze it right into this journey,

274
00:10:05.215 --> 00:10:06.677
right where you're feeling upset,

275
00:10:06.677 --> 00:10:08.413
you'll feel the energies go,

276
00:10:08.413 --> 00:10:10.233
it just goes out.
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

277
00:10:10.233 --> 00:10:13.683
<v ->Gone, and you gotta do that once or twice and you're sold.</v>

278
00:10:13.683 --> 00:10:14.771
<v Voiceover>You can do this</v>

279
00:10:14.771 --> 00:10:16.767
for healing really anything within.

280
00:10:16.767 --> 00:10:17.738
<v ->Oh yes.</v>

281
00:10:17.738 --> 00:10:20.818
<v Voiceover>In fact, I was listening to, or reading,</v>

282
00:10:20.818 --> 00:10:22.870
I can't remember now, on your site.

283
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:26.375
I thought this was such a trip talking about

284
00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:28.330
how you can direct the energy

285
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.300
for healing others as well, of course.

286
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.015
Same thing, down through the arm and hand, projecting it,

287
00:10:33.705 --> 00:10:35.888
but how you can do this with your fuel tank.

288
00:10:35.888 --> 00:10:36.658
<v ->Yeah.</v>

289
00:10:36.658 --> 00:10:37.772
<v Voiceover>This was amazing.</v>

290
00:10:37.772 --> 00:10:39.014
Can you talk about that for a minute?

291
00:10:39.014 --> 00:10:42.036
This is one of those fun little bits in this interview.

292
00:10:42.036 --> 00:10:42.992
<v ->I'll tell you this.</v>

293
00:10:42.992 --> 00:10:44.606
This fuel tank we're talking about

294
00:10:44.606 --> 00:10:47.502
is the pranic energy that all of us have,

295
00:10:47.502 --> 00:10:50.307
that it's already in us without even knowing it.

296
00:10:50.307 --> 00:10:53.514
Just walking outside the store right now,

297
00:10:53.514 --> 00:10:55.502
Energy is gonna go right into you.

298
00:10:55.502 --> 00:10:57.427
If you don't want it, it's just gonna get there.

299
00:10:57.427 --> 00:10:59.521
It begins in this fuel tank,

300
00:10:59.521 --> 00:11:02.776
but you can get into this energy by going through

301
00:11:02.776 --> 00:11:04.549
my system, coming out

302
00:11:06.459 --> 00:11:07.959
down my arms, down to my hands,

303
00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:10.512
and get into your Pati and go right there

304
00:11:10.512 --> 00:11:14.735
and ignite that fuel system right before your eyes.

305
00:11:14.735 --> 00:11:17.548
Everybody knows this is possible, right.

306
00:11:17.548 --> 00:11:19.735
<v Voiceover>Yes, now I was talking quite literally.</v>

307
00:11:19.735 --> 00:11:21.517
There was a bit from Kirael.

308
00:11:21.517 --> 00:11:22.811
You may or may not even remember it,

309
00:11:22.811 --> 00:11:24.741
where Kirael is talking about,

310
00:11:25.491 --> 00:11:28.845
he said you can actually get better gas mileage in your car.

311
00:11:28.845 --> 00:11:29.759
<v ->Oh yes.</v>

312
00:11:30.239 --> 00:11:31.951
<v Voiceover>While you're filling the tank,</v>

313
00:11:31.951 --> 00:11:34.228
running the prana through you and infusing it

314
00:11:34.228 --> 00:11:36.324
into the tank with the gasoline as it's filling,

315
00:11:36.324 --> 00:11:38.142
and that you actually get--

316
00:11:39.242 --> 00:11:40.751
<v ->Yeah, that's right.</v>

317
00:11:40.751 --> 00:11:43.972
It's so perfect because with all these gas prices.

318
00:11:43.972 --> 00:11:46.825
$5 a gallon in Hawaii, right,
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

319
00:11:46.825 --> 00:11:48.351
<v ->which is just outrageous.</v>

320
00:11:48.351 --> 00:11:50.300
He said if you're gonna stand there,

321
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.678
you gotta hold the thing anyway.

322
00:11:51.678 --> 00:11:55.307
Why don't you run the energy down into your thymus,

323
00:11:55.307 --> 00:11:59.684
back down your arm and right into the nozzle.

324
00:11:59.684 --> 00:12:02.243
I'm thinking, well what the heck.

325
00:12:02.243 --> 00:12:05.306
He never lied, right, so I stand there,

326
00:12:05.306 --> 00:12:07.807
and I swear to God I could feel the energy

327
00:12:07.807 --> 00:12:09.656
coming out of my hand, going into the tank,

328
00:12:09.656 --> 00:12:12.736
and it's like the fuel tank was actually glowing.

329
00:12:12.736 --> 00:12:13.714
It was really glowing.

330
00:12:13.714 --> 00:12:14.825
<v Voiceover>Did you get better mileage?</v>

331
00:12:14.825 --> 00:12:15.659
<v ->Oh yes.</v>

332
00:12:15.659 --> 00:12:17.504
<v Voiceover>Ok, alright, you already have us sold.</v>

333
00:12:17.504 --> 00:12:18.592
We'll all give that a try.

334
00:12:18.592 --> 00:12:19.762
Anyone who can run energy,

335
00:12:19.762 --> 00:12:21.509
let's try it next time we fill up.

336
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:22.290
<v ->That's right.</v>

337
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.052
<v Voiceover>It's good all the way around.</v>

338
00:12:24.052 --> 00:12:25.988
<v ->It's so simple because all you gotta do</v>

339
00:12:25.988 --> 00:12:27.367
is you gotta breathe it in

340
00:12:29.767 --> 00:12:31.110
right down your arm,
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

341
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.288
<v ->and right into the tank.
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

342
00:12:32.288 --> 00:12:34.304
<v ->It works. It's so perfect.</v>

343
00:12:34.304 --> 00:12:36.398
<v Voiceover>I think it's, again, I said this earlier,</v>

344
00:12:36.398 --> 00:12:38.179
but it's important for people to know that

345
00:12:38.179 --> 00:12:40.330
if you can train your eyes to see it,

346
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:44.184
it's unfathomable how much energy

347
00:12:44.184 --> 00:12:47.510
is piercing down from the cosmos through us

348
00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.705
and every living thing on this planet at all times.

349
00:12:49.705 --> 00:12:52.415
I used to love watching it on morning walks.

350
00:12:52.415 --> 00:12:55.168
It was just sheets, almost like sleet, hail,

351
00:12:55.168 --> 00:12:57.790
just sheets of energy pouring into the earth.

352
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:01.262
So it's very, very real in just imagining that.

353
00:13:02.472 --> 00:13:05.070
One of the things that you wrote about--

354
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:05.945
Thank you for that.

355
00:13:05.945 --> 00:13:07.706
I wanted to get into the photon energy.

356
00:13:07.706 --> 00:13:10.121
One of the things that I read on your site

357
00:13:10.121 --> 00:13:13.067
that Kirael has talked about is also

358
00:13:13.067 --> 00:13:15.612
the resurrection of the feminine energy,

359
00:13:15.612 --> 00:13:17.552
and it's place in all of this.

360
00:13:17.552 --> 00:13:18.872
Can you please talk about that?

361
00:13:18.872 --> 00:13:20.451
<v ->Yeah, I'd be glad to because,</v>

362
00:13:20.451 --> 00:13:23.099
and I'm gonna talk about something that may feel

363
00:13:23.099 --> 00:13:26.120
a little uneasy on this whole journey.

364
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.211
I have a group of people, they're called the Goddess Lights,

365
00:13:29.211 --> 00:13:33.086
Silver Wings, or Goddess Light and they're at the church.

366
00:13:33.086 --> 00:13:35.486
They go around country.

367
00:13:38.036 --> 00:13:40.043
This is gonna throw your audience off a little bit,

368
00:13:40.043 --> 00:13:42.703
but there's a place that we know as the Maria.

369
00:13:42.703 --> 00:13:44.234
<v Voiceover>The Maria, yes.</v>
<v ->The Maria, right.</v>

370
00:13:45.511 --> 00:13:47.904
This whole journey was 50,000 years ago.

371
00:13:47.904 --> 00:13:49.191
So what do we know about 50,000 years ago.

372
00:13:49.191 --> 00:13:51.345
Master Kirael will tell you or Kryon

373
00:13:51.345 --> 00:13:52.898
or somebody's telling you,

374
00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:54.279
but they're all saying the same thing,

375
00:13:54.279 --> 00:13:55.684
so this might be something about it.

376
00:13:57.054 --> 00:13:59.514
This whole journey was at the end of that time,

377
00:13:59.514 --> 00:14:01.719
this Goddess Light, which was really,

378
00:14:01.719 --> 00:14:04.344
it was matriotical, matriotic

379
00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:07.787
because their whole journey was about fairness

380
00:14:07.787 --> 00:14:11.679
and everything ran on counsels.

381
00:14:11.679 --> 00:14:12.878
They didn't have a president.

382
00:14:12.878 --> 00:14:15.397
They had a queen, but not that type of queen.

383
00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:17.832
This whole journey was run on counsels,

384
00:14:17.832 --> 00:14:21.210
and the matriotic, the point of this whole journey

385
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.675
was Goddess theme, but what they--

386
00:14:23.675 --> 00:14:25.945
This is gonna sound crazy, but here it comes.

387
00:14:25.945 --> 00:14:29.188
At the end of the Maria, the beautiful energies

388
00:14:29.188 --> 00:14:31.538
that were supposed to be a third-dimensional journey

389
00:14:31.538 --> 00:14:33.637
had gotten already fourth dimensional.

390
00:14:33.637 --> 00:14:36.208
The Creator made decisions or whatever

391
00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:39.888
that this is supposed to be a third-dimensional reality.

392
00:14:39.888 --> 00:14:42.947
So, He took this Goddess Light,

393
00:14:42.947 --> 00:14:45.473
and I guess He drew them all together,

394
00:14:46.453 --> 00:14:48.095
and He actually told them they had to go

395
00:14:48.095 --> 00:14:51.697
and actually put these hooks into the matrix energy.

396
00:14:51.697 --> 00:14:54.207
What's this matrix energy we're talking about?

397
00:14:54.977 --> 00:14:57.453
What we're all doing right now is the matrix energy, right.

398
00:14:57.453 --> 00:15:00.888
They went out around the world, literally around the world,

399
00:15:00.888 --> 00:15:04.738
and they actually drove this energy into the matrix

400
00:15:05.978 --> 00:15:09.228
and hooked the matrix to it, and there it was.

401
00:15:09.228 --> 00:15:11.789
It's been that way for like 50,000 years.

402
00:15:13.699 --> 00:15:16.235
I'm saying, this is a little hard for you to grasp.

403
00:15:16.235 --> 00:15:17.446
<v Voiceover>No, I understand the matrix.</v>

404
00:15:17.446 --> 00:15:20.011
I understand that, but what are you saying,

405
00:15:20.011 --> 00:15:22.925
what was the purpose of the feminine energy

406
00:15:22.925 --> 00:15:25.743
hooking into the matrix, again?

407
00:15:25.743 --> 00:15:29.945
<v ->They actually had to hook this matrix down to this planet</v>

408
00:15:29.945 --> 00:15:31.780
because we had already gone into a fourth dimension.

409
00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:32.794
<v Voiceover>Oh I see, because we were</v>

410
00:15:32.794 --> 00:15:34.542
moving into another frequency.
<v ->Right, right.</v>

411
00:15:34.542 --> 00:15:37.284
The God Creator said, "No, I want this to be"

412
00:15:37.284 --> 00:15:38.788
"a third-dimensional energy."

413
00:15:38.788 --> 00:15:39.949
It's all about yin and yang,

414
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:43.018
the front, the back, the boy, girl, up, down.

415
00:15:43.018 --> 00:15:44.344
<v Voiceover>Yup.</v>
<v ->Everything has an opposite.</v>

416
00:15:44.344 --> 00:15:47.115
So that's what the matrix is all about, right.

417
00:15:47.115 --> 00:15:48.771
So they went around the world

418
00:15:48.771 --> 00:15:51.505
and they just went into places like Patty's been to.

419
00:15:51.505 --> 00:15:56.018
My wife's been to places like Japan and Machu Picchu,

420
00:15:56.018 --> 00:15:58.863
and just every place around the world.

421
00:15:58.863 --> 00:16:01.182
Russia, she's done it, and so on and so forth.

422
00:16:02.042 --> 00:16:04.473
Their whole journey is about going out there

423
00:16:04.473 --> 00:16:06.641
and now removing these hooks again.

424
00:16:06.641 --> 00:16:09.518
So what they went in and put in 50,000 years ago,

425
00:16:09.518 --> 00:16:11.272
somebody's gotta go pull them out now.

426
00:16:11.272 --> 00:16:13.505
So they're really striving.

427
00:16:13.505 --> 00:16:15.174
This whole journey is so powerful.

428
00:16:15.174 --> 00:16:17.529
I'm just as proud of it as I could be

429
00:16:17.529 --> 00:16:20.521
because it is matriotical, but I understand this,

430
00:16:20.521 --> 00:16:22.914
and I'm not talking about me, male, you, female.

431
00:16:23.474 --> 00:16:26.213
The female energy is X chromosome.

432
00:16:26.213 --> 00:16:29.431
X Chromosome, Y for males.

433
00:16:30.761 --> 00:16:32.773
That's just gotta tell you something.

434
00:16:32.773 --> 00:16:34.986
The four bodies, one, two, three, four.

435
00:16:34.986 --> 00:16:36.455
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->That's perfect.</v>

436
00:16:36.455 --> 00:16:37.769
That's what I'm saying.

437
00:16:37.769 --> 00:16:40.308
I say this to you because thank God, you're a female,

438
00:16:40.308 --> 00:16:43.148
but this whole journey is about you're the female

439
00:16:43.148 --> 00:16:45.067
and you know what you're doing.

440
00:16:45.067 --> 00:16:48.093
You know it beyond your wildest expectation.

441
00:16:48.093 --> 00:16:49.783
That's what I've gotta depend on.

442
00:16:49.783 --> 00:16:52.935
I've gotta depend on you to be there for us,

443
00:16:52.935 --> 00:16:55.233
and that's our turn, your turn.

444
00:16:55.233 --> 00:16:57.570
The thing that you've gotta understand,

445
00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:01.103
the female has been put down for a very long time.

446
00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:02.240
You know it and I know it.

447
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.809
I'm not trying to make it bad or good or anything.

448
00:17:04.809 --> 00:17:06.185
It's just what happened.

449
00:17:08.015 --> 00:17:09.755
They are now coming alive.

450
00:17:09.755 --> 00:17:11.364
They're becoming so alert.

451
00:17:11.974 --> 00:17:13.746
You're in charge of your interview.

452
00:17:13.746 --> 00:17:14.340
You know that.

453
00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:16.495
You're in charge, no question about it,

454
00:17:16.495 --> 00:17:20.039
but this whole journey is because you know what's going on.

455
00:17:22.269 --> 00:17:23.309
At some point, you're gonna have to

456
00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:25.201
let this X thing come out a little bit stronger.

457
00:17:25.201 --> 00:17:27.681
You're Goddess Weave, or your Goddess Light,

458
00:17:27.681 --> 00:17:29.515
or whatever you wanna call yourself

459
00:17:29.515 --> 00:17:31.106
is gonna be so powerful.

460
00:17:31.106 --> 00:17:33.205
So you have this little thing going in your stomach.

461
00:17:33.205 --> 00:17:35.681
That's just perfect for what we're talking about,

462
00:17:35.681 --> 00:17:36.968
the great shift.

463
00:17:36.968 --> 00:17:39.599
I'd like to think it's gonna be 2012, but I don't know.

464
00:17:39.599 --> 00:17:41.813
It could be 2018 for all I can tell you,

465
00:17:41.813 --> 00:17:45.668
but the sooner the better because I just wanna get it on.

466
00:17:45.668 --> 00:17:47.048
You know, let's just do this thing, right,

467
00:17:47.048 --> 00:17:48.800
because I wanna get to this fourth light

468
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.368
right here on this planet.
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

469
00:17:50.368 --> 00:17:51.230
<v ->Right here.</v>

470
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.896
<v Voiceover>Our DNA is having to</v>

471
00:17:54.976 --> 00:17:56.768
go through some extreme stretches

472
00:17:56.768 --> 00:17:58.080
in order to prepare for this.

473
00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.603
Can you talk about the DNA changes?

474
00:17:59.603 --> 00:18:01.601
<v ->Yeah, I can tell you this and again,</v>

475
00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:06.781
just hear what I'm saying and then you do

476
00:18:06.781 --> 00:18:08.037
what you wanna do with it.

477
00:18:08.037 --> 00:18:11.691
Understand that most you females,

478
00:18:12.741 --> 00:18:13.786
you're really not separate.

479
00:18:13.786 --> 00:18:17.559
You're the notch that we're trying to groove into, right.

480
00:18:18.539 --> 00:18:21.437
That's a terrible thing to say, but it's really the truth.

481
00:18:21.437 --> 00:18:23.077
This whole journey is about

482
00:18:23.077 --> 00:18:27.021
your DNA is already four strands.

483
00:18:27.021 --> 00:18:30.123
You're not just a two-strand DNA that you think you are.

484
00:18:30.123 --> 00:18:33.221
You know you're not because you're feeling things,

485
00:18:33.221 --> 00:18:34.939
like you said, when you're doing your walk,

486
00:18:34.939 --> 00:18:37.124
your morning walks, what are you seeing?

487
00:18:37.124 --> 00:18:37.715
<v Voiceover>Pranan.</v>

488
00:18:37.715 --> 00:18:39.966
<v ->Nobody else is seeing it, but you're seeing it.</v>

489
00:18:39.966 --> 00:18:41.612
My wife sees it, where she's going out

490
00:18:41.612 --> 00:18:42.896
doing these hook removals.

491
00:18:42.896 --> 00:18:44.078
They did one in

492
00:18:48.278 --> 00:18:49.118
Niagra Falls.

493
00:18:49.118 --> 00:18:50.293
Niagra Falls in New York.

494
00:18:50.293 --> 00:18:53.186
They went into Niagra Falls and did this hook removal.

495
00:18:53.186 --> 00:18:55.577
They had to go under the water to get this thing.

496
00:18:55.577 --> 00:18:57.987
Literally, their minds go into there,

497
00:18:57.987 --> 00:19:01.010
but this whole journey is about the DNA strands.

498
00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:04.272
I can show you right now that anybody

499
00:19:04.272 --> 00:19:05.253
that's gonna listen to this thing

500
00:19:05.253 --> 00:19:07.580
for any interest at all,

501
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.284
they're gonna get anything from this thing,

502
00:19:09.284 --> 00:19:11.479
they can check into their own energies right now.

503
00:19:11.479 --> 00:19:15.484
They can see the two strands that people can't see anymore.

504
00:19:15.484 --> 00:19:16.932
The doctors can't see them.

505
00:19:16.932 --> 00:19:18.955
No they can, but they're not gonna admit it, right.

506
00:19:18.955 --> 00:19:21.647
You really can't because they're already,

507
00:19:21.647 --> 00:19:23.508
now we're going to six strands.

508
00:19:23.508 --> 00:19:25.833
We haven't even gotten the four straightened up

509
00:19:25.833 --> 00:19:27.095
and we're gonna go to six strands.

510
00:19:27.095 --> 00:19:29.018
So what I'm saying to you is this DNA thing

511
00:19:29.018 --> 00:19:31.285
is happening so quickly and so powerfully

512
00:19:31.285 --> 00:19:33.947
that it's gonna happen so automatically,

513
00:19:33.947 --> 00:19:36.238
that people are gonna be caught way off guard

514
00:19:36.238 --> 00:19:37.382
on this whole journey.

515
00:19:37.382 --> 00:19:38.158
That's the truth.

516
00:19:38.158 --> 00:19:38.951
I tell you this.

517
00:19:38.951 --> 00:19:40.668
That's the one thing I can tell you right now.

518
00:19:40.668 --> 00:19:42.070
They're gonna be caught off guard

519
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:43.909
because they'll have never heard this interview

520
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:45.237
and they're just gonna go to the doctor,

521
00:19:45.237 --> 00:19:47.712
and the doctor will say, "What is that?"

522
00:19:47.712 --> 00:19:49.752
You know, the four strands of DNA.

523
00:19:49.752 --> 00:19:50.987
What am I gonna do with this,

524
00:19:50.987 --> 00:19:53.087
because it's not what this body is made for.

525
00:19:53.857 --> 00:19:56.519
Is it? Might be, might be.

526
00:19:56.519 --> 00:20:00.124
<v Voiceover>Well when you've got 95% "junk DNA,"</v>

527
00:20:00.124 --> 00:20:01.467
that can't be right.

528
00:20:01.467 --> 00:20:02.926
<v ->That's right, that's right.</v>

529
00:20:02.926 --> 00:20:06.220
<v Voiceover>So we're simply firing up aspects</v>

530
00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.119
that have been dormant, very rapidly.

531
00:20:09.119 --> 00:20:10.631
How does the sun play into this?

532
00:20:10.631 --> 00:20:12.663
<v ->The sun is actually,</v>

533
00:20:12.663 --> 00:20:16.693
the sun, it does play.

534
00:20:16.693 --> 00:20:19.724
You turn back in time, for instance,

535
00:20:19.724 --> 00:20:22.511
and I'm not an authority but I just know this.

536
00:20:24.271 --> 00:20:26.292
Jesus Christ came onto this earth plane,

537
00:20:26.292 --> 00:20:27.866
whether you wanna believe it or not.

538
00:20:27.866 --> 00:20:29.653
Somebody was there doing something,

539
00:20:29.653 --> 00:20:31.427
because we're talking about 2,000 years.

540
00:20:31.427 --> 00:20:32.843
We're still talking about him.

541
00:20:32.843 --> 00:20:34.306
He was doing something powerful.

542
00:20:34.306 --> 00:20:36.262
Well, that's the truth.

543
00:20:36.262 --> 00:20:40.731
He died at a very short age, a young age.

544
00:20:40.731 --> 00:20:42.748
If you really look at history,

545
00:20:42.748 --> 00:20:45.484
you recognize that Christ consciousness.

546
00:20:45.484 --> 00:20:47.146
Was He born Christ?

547
00:20:47.146 --> 00:20:48.952
No, He wasn't born Christ.

548
00:20:48.952 --> 00:20:50.360
He got Christed.

549
00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.816
Forgive me, my lack of words, but he got Christed

550
00:20:52.816 --> 00:20:56.883
in this journey with a guy named John the Baptist.

551
00:20:58.033 --> 00:21:00.529
The Goddess when into this state,

552
00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:03.963
put a circle around him and did this whole journey.

553
00:21:03.963 --> 00:21:05.149
Here's what he says.

554
00:21:05.699 --> 00:21:09.960
This is the water and the Goddess put this band

555
00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:14.723
of photon energy 2000 years ago, my God.

556
00:21:17.463 --> 00:21:20.409
John the Baptist, he would dunk him and stand him up, right.

557
00:21:20.409 --> 00:21:23.286
With Jesus, what he did is he dunked Him and brought Him up,

558
00:21:23.286 --> 00:21:24.914
and brought Him right here,

559
00:21:24.914 --> 00:21:27.739
so just His nose, His face was out of the water,

560
00:21:27.739 --> 00:21:29.246
and He got all this photon energy.

561
00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:31.029
This is why He glowed.

562
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:34.420
He literally glowed because He was so filled with energy.

563
00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:38.531
So He walks out of this journey and just a matter

564
00:21:38.531 --> 00:21:40.259
of a couple years later He's dead.

565
00:21:40.259 --> 00:21:43.058
Well, it says He's dead, but that's all stories.

566
00:21:43.058 --> 00:21:46.678
You have to understand Christianity died

567
00:21:46.678 --> 00:21:49.278
with Jesus for 300 years.

568
00:21:49.278 --> 00:21:51.863
You can go and people, go check it out.

569
00:21:51.863 --> 00:21:53.900
There's nothing in the books that says anything

570
00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.640
about anything that can prove

571
00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.966
anything happened for 300 years.

572
00:21:58.966 --> 00:22:01.294
<v Voicever>Yes, I'm familiar with that.</v>

573
00:22:01.294 --> 00:22:02.927
<v ->The Catholic Church.</v>

574
00:22:02.927 --> 00:22:04.528
<v Voiceover>Constantine.</v>

575
00:22:04.528 --> 00:22:06.238
<v ->That's right, they brought it all back.</v>

576
00:22:06.238 --> 00:22:08.178
They lit it up and it went on again.

577
00:22:09.538 --> 00:22:12.361
We're still talking about this man, 2,000 years.

578
00:22:12.361 --> 00:22:13.602
It's a powerful guy.

579
00:22:14.462 --> 00:22:15.875
He has also an X-chromosome.

580
00:22:16.895 --> 00:22:17.870
<v Voiceover>X-chromosome.</v>

581
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:19.406
<v ->Yes, he didn't have a father.</v>

582
00:22:19.406 --> 00:22:20.481
<v Voiceover>Yeah, yeah.</v>
<v ->He had a mother.</v>

583
00:22:20.481 --> 00:22:22.201
<v Voiceover>I see what you're saying, yeah.</v>

584
00:22:23.291 --> 00:22:24.612
Well I will say one thing.

585
00:22:24.612 --> 00:22:26.690
I've been to John the Baptist's hang out.

586
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:27.408
<v ->Oh really?</v>

587
00:22:27.408 --> 00:22:29.270
<v Voiceover>To the cave where he supposedly</v>

588
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:32.013
did his deep work and meditations,

589
00:22:32.013 --> 00:22:34.237
and the wells right next to it and so forth.

590
00:22:35.097 --> 00:22:37.670
I had the most mind-blowing experience of my life in there.

591
00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:39.211
Totally unexpectedly, of course.

592
00:22:39.211 --> 00:22:40.087
<v ->Oh my God.
<v Voiceover>I was just</v>

593
00:22:40.087 --> 00:22:41.697
sitting down to check out the energies

594
00:22:41.697 --> 00:22:45.023
and there was a show of unbelievable proportions.

595
00:22:46.013 --> 00:22:48.842
Some kind of initiation I will probably not understand

596
00:22:48.842 --> 00:22:50.538
until I'm out of the physical.

597
00:22:50.538 --> 00:22:52.079
So, power JuJu.

598
00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:53.844
Powerful JuJu there.

599
00:22:53.844 --> 00:22:56.884
(laughs)

600
00:22:56.884 --> 00:22:59.433
<v ->Sometimes I hear myself talking about this stuff</v>

601
00:22:59.433 --> 00:23:01.009
and think, did I really say that?

602
00:23:01.009 --> 00:23:02.062
I did, didnt I.

603
00:23:02.062 --> 00:23:04.326
It's really embarrassing because I believe

604
00:23:04.326 --> 00:23:05.669
everything I've told you.

605
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:07.490
Everything I've told you has been my truth.

606
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.586
I don't profess for anybody to figure it

607
00:23:10.586 --> 00:23:12.620
or understand it or even wanna believe it,

608
00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.350
but I know it's truth.

609
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:15.409
That's what I know.

610
00:23:15.409 --> 00:23:17.922
<v Voiceover>Yes, and you have</v>

611
00:23:17.922 --> 00:23:20.288
thousands and thousands upon thousands of people

612
00:23:20.288 --> 00:23:22.004
that listen to you and come to see you speak

613
00:23:22.004 --> 00:23:23.467
around the globe.

614
00:23:26.047 --> 00:23:28.407
So we've talked about the photon energy.

615
00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:30.846
We've talked about the DNA and the sunshine.

616
00:23:30.846 --> 00:23:32.249
Let's get a little bit denser.

617
00:23:32.739 --> 00:23:35.602
The way we're feeding our physical bodies

618
00:23:36.092 --> 00:23:38.836
has to change in order to be able

619
00:23:38.836 --> 00:23:41.287
to make this leap in refinement.

620
00:23:41.287 --> 00:23:42.350
<v ->That's right.</v>

621
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:43.281
<v Voiceover>Can you talk about that?</v>

622
00:23:43.281 --> 00:23:44.861
Kirael has gone on about that a bit.

623
00:23:44.861 --> 00:23:47.298
<v ->Yeah, in fact he's not real happy with me right now</v>

624
00:23:47.298 --> 00:23:48.744
because I'm a little overweight,

625
00:23:49.974 --> 00:23:53.383
but I understand it because I'm too busy

626
00:23:54.133 --> 00:23:55.318
doing something else.

627
00:23:55.318 --> 00:23:58.168
Wrong, I just gotta get hold of my journey,

628
00:23:58.168 --> 00:24:00.223
because you've got to have a body,

629
00:24:00.223 --> 00:24:01.658
and I don't say this to anybody out there

630
00:24:01.658 --> 00:24:05.027
that's suffering weight problems.

631
00:24:05.027 --> 00:24:07.089
There's so many people that are really suffering

632
00:24:07.089 --> 00:24:08.425
from weight problems right now,

633
00:24:08.425 --> 00:24:10.030
but I want you to hear me say this.

634
00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:12.184
When you're ready to change,

635
00:24:12.184 --> 00:24:13.611
you're gonna change just like that.

636
00:24:13.611 --> 00:24:14.527
Just boink.

637
00:24:14.527 --> 00:24:16.019
<v Voiceover>We need to talk about that.</v>

638
00:24:16.019 --> 00:24:17.983
We need to talk about that very thing.

639
00:24:17.983 --> 00:24:20.919
That fascinated me most, reading your site.

640
00:24:20.919 --> 00:24:24.445
Let's talk about that, and then go into the food,

641
00:24:24.445 --> 00:24:25.724
since you're already there.

642
00:24:25.724 --> 00:24:26.624
<v ->Alright.</v>

643
00:24:26.624 --> 00:24:28.055
<v Voiceover>You were saying that</v>

644
00:24:28.055 --> 00:24:32.065
do not talk about change.

645
00:24:32.065 --> 00:24:34.087
Do not talk about new endeavors

646
00:24:34.087 --> 00:24:36.838
until you are absolutely prepared to begin.

647
00:24:36.838 --> 00:24:38.177
<v ->That's right.
<v Voiceover>Why is that?</v>

648
00:24:38.177 --> 00:24:40.095
Talk about the energetic dynamic of this.

649
00:24:40.095 --> 00:24:41.435
<v ->That's it right there.</v>

650
00:24:41.435 --> 00:24:43.389
It's in the dynamics because you've got

651
00:24:43.389 --> 00:24:45.467
this whole journey going on right now.

652
00:24:45.467 --> 00:24:46.937
You have to understand this whole journey

653
00:24:48.417 --> 00:24:50.327
is about what you're gonna feel.

654
00:24:50.327 --> 00:24:52.923
You're gonna feel it and if you're doing something about it,

655
00:24:52.923 --> 00:24:54.270
then you're gonna get a good feeling.

656
00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:57.587
If you're not gonna do it, you're gonna feel worse,

657
00:24:57.587 --> 00:25:00.655
and it's gonna continually get worse and worse and worse.

658
00:25:00.655 --> 00:25:02.232
<v Voiceover>But what is this about the commitment,</v>

659
00:25:02.232 --> 00:25:03.860
rather than saying, oh I'm going to start,

660
00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:04.760
I'm going to the gym,

661
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.229
I'm going to start going to the gym.

662
00:25:06.229 --> 00:25:07.195
<v ->Everybody says that.</v>

663
00:25:07.195 --> 00:25:08.749
<v Voiceover>Yeah, they do, and then they don't do it.</v>

664
00:25:08.749 --> 00:25:11.419
What does this set up inside when we say it and don't do it?

665
00:25:11.419 --> 00:25:14.099
<v ->It's sets up you pushing yourself</v>

666
00:25:14.099 --> 00:25:16.124
back away in the shift, basically.

667
00:25:16.124 --> 00:25:17.929
Every time you're gonna say--

668
00:25:17.929 --> 00:25:20.274
Because I tell you, don't talk about it

669
00:25:20.274 --> 00:25:21.722
until you really wanna do it,

670
00:25:21.722 --> 00:25:24.489
because if you're gonna set it up and you're gonna say

671
00:25:24.489 --> 00:25:26.710
go to the gym, and you go once or twice,

672
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:29.761
and then you don't go back, you're actually defaulting.

673
00:25:29.761 --> 00:25:31.404
You're whole body is defaulted.

674
00:25:31.404 --> 00:25:33.411
It's tried to go with you.

675
00:25:33.411 --> 00:25:34.724
It's tried to go to the gym.

676
00:25:36.324 --> 00:25:38.276
You're gonna work too hard, or whatever.

677
00:25:38.276 --> 00:25:40.008
You're not gonna enjoy it, whatever,

678
00:25:40.008 --> 00:25:41.246
you're just not gonna do it,

679
00:25:41.246 --> 00:25:43.149
but that defaults this whole system,

680
00:25:43.149 --> 00:25:44.847
this body system, right.

681
00:25:46.497 --> 00:25:49.160
In the first interview we talked about the 6 billion people.

682
00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:52.016
You gotta understand, this whole thing has gotta be prepared

683
00:25:52.016 --> 00:25:54.136
to make this great shift in consciousness.

684
00:25:54.136 --> 00:25:56.961
I'm not saying about something happening

685
00:25:56.961 --> 00:25:59.687
that's gonna boom down on your or anything

686
00:25:59.687 --> 00:26:01.076
but it could be that bad.

687
00:26:01.076 --> 00:26:04.495
Understand this whole thing, if you're gonna do something

688
00:26:04.495 --> 00:26:06.069
and you're gonna back away from it,

689
00:26:06.069 --> 00:26:07.989
you're gonna default this whole journey.

690
00:26:07.989 --> 00:26:10.917
Defaulting simply means you're defaulting

691
00:26:10.917 --> 00:26:13.399
and you're gonna go back a huge step.

692
00:26:13.399 --> 00:26:15.005
<v Voiceover>So no false starts.</v>

693
00:26:15.005 --> 00:26:16.776
Do it or don't do it.
<v ->That's right.</v>

694
00:26:17.746 --> 00:26:19.560
Think about it, think you're gonna do it,

695
00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.691
but don't put yourself in that program.

696
00:26:21.691 --> 00:26:24.769
Don't start the program until you know you're gonna do it.

697
00:26:24.769 --> 00:26:27.190
You gotta know because if you don't,

698
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:30.075
you're gonna pay a certain price for everything.

699
00:26:31.215 --> 00:26:33.153
I don't like to talk about this too much

700
00:26:33.153 --> 00:26:34.634
because it's a little frightening,

701
00:26:34.634 --> 00:26:36.229
but if you're gonna do these things,

702
00:26:36.229 --> 00:26:39.569
and you're gonna pay a price, a serious price.

703
00:26:39.569 --> 00:26:42.239
You can get sick or anything.

704
00:26:42.239 --> 00:26:45.842
If you start these journeys and you don't keep them going,

705
00:26:45.842 --> 00:26:48.572
you're faulting, and you're gonna default,

706
00:26:48.572 --> 00:26:50.266
and you're gonna fault backwards.

707
00:26:50.266 --> 00:26:52.621
If you're body has come up this far,

708
00:26:52.621 --> 00:26:54.999
and you fault back to here, that's where it's at.

709
00:26:55.509 --> 00:26:57.747
So you gotta be prepared for this really quickly.

710
00:26:57.747 --> 00:26:58.719
<v Voiceover>Ok.</v>

711
00:26:58.719 --> 00:27:00.223
Be prepared running now.

712
00:27:00.223 --> 00:27:01.445
So just do what I say.

713
00:27:01.445 --> 00:27:04.005
Don't start until you know you're gonna do it.

714
00:27:04.005 --> 00:27:05.424
Then you're gonna do it.

715
00:27:05.424 --> 00:27:06.999
<v Voiceover>Ok, now let's go to the food.</v>

716
00:27:06.999 --> 00:27:07.693
<v ->Ok.</v>

717
00:27:07.693 --> 00:27:09.318
<v Voiceover>We need to change what we're doing.</v>

718
00:27:09.318 --> 00:27:10.395
<v ->You do need to.</v>

719
00:27:10.395 --> 00:27:13.253
You need to, and I have a good friend.

720
00:27:13.253 --> 00:27:16.992
His name is Rob and he doesn't really love my journey

721
00:27:16.992 --> 00:27:21.525
because I told him that Pastor Kirael said that,

722
00:27:21.525 --> 00:27:25.507
for instance, the persons that are not gonna go

723
00:27:25.507 --> 00:27:28.037
through this shift are non-evolving animals,

724
00:27:28.037 --> 00:27:30.091
and one of those is a cow,

725
00:27:30.091 --> 00:27:32.298
which means he's not gonna have his hamburgers.

726
00:27:33.288 --> 00:27:36.022
He really got upset, really upset.

727
00:27:36.022 --> 00:27:37.164
He said, "I'm not going through"

728
00:27:37.164 --> 00:27:38.285
"this shift without hamburgers."

729
00:27:38.285 --> 00:27:39.958
I said, you know, it's alright,

730
00:27:39.958 --> 00:27:41.464
because you know as well as I do,

731
00:27:41.464 --> 00:27:43.093
there's certain things we should be eating,

732
00:27:43.093 --> 00:27:44.749
and certain things we shouldn't be doing.

733
00:27:44.749 --> 00:27:47.397
The whole journey is, when you get to this point,

734
00:27:47.397 --> 00:27:49.933
I'm not trying to make everybody a vegetarian.

735
00:27:49.933 --> 00:27:50.822
I'm really not.

736
00:27:50.822 --> 00:27:52.884
I'm just telling you that the closer

737
00:27:52.884 --> 00:27:54.352
you can come to vegetarian,

738
00:27:54.352 --> 00:27:56.015
then the better you're gonna feel.

739
00:27:56.015 --> 00:27:59.470
If you feel better, then you're gonna look better.

740
00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:02.361
If you look better, you're gonna do something better.

741
00:28:02.361 --> 00:28:04.959
So this whole thing becomes a cycle of understanding,

742
00:28:04.959 --> 00:28:06.498
and it starts with your food.

743
00:28:06.498 --> 00:28:07.853
You're intake of food.

744
00:28:07.853 --> 00:28:09.782
So, what I'm saying to everybody

745
00:28:09.782 --> 00:28:11.756
is find something in the vegetables

746
00:28:11.756 --> 00:28:14.053
that you really like and go with them.

747
00:28:14.053 --> 00:28:14.753
Eat them everyday.

748
00:28:14.753 --> 00:28:16.108
<v Voiceover>When you're talking, again,</v>

749
00:28:16.108 --> 00:28:18.426
direct contact with the sun, photo nutrients.

750
00:28:18.426 --> 00:28:19.309
<v ->That's right.</v>

751
00:28:19.735 --> 00:28:21.703
<v Voiceover>These vital nutrients actually.</v>

752
00:28:21.703 --> 00:28:24.527
These vital nutrients are much finer

753
00:28:24.527 --> 00:28:27.423
than virtually anything else we put into our body.

754
00:28:27.423 --> 00:28:29.670
These things that are alive with color, right?

755
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:30.388
<v ->That's right.</v>

756
00:28:30.388 --> 00:28:31.984
So, what Master Kirael said,

757
00:28:31.984 --> 00:28:34.333
he said that everybody's gonna go through

758
00:28:34.333 --> 00:28:36.211
this shift that needs to be there.

759
00:28:37.681 --> 00:28:38.714
Look at like a--

760
00:28:38.714 --> 00:28:40.410
I hate to say it but the cockroach

761
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:42.037
is gonna make it through the shift.

762
00:28:42.037 --> 00:28:42.858
Bummer, right?

763
00:28:42.858 --> 00:28:43.539
<v Voiceover>Highly adaptable.</v>

764
00:28:43.539 --> 00:28:45.271
<v ->Yeah, I know, they're really--</v>

765
00:28:47.741 --> 00:28:49.903
But a cow, a loving cow,

766
00:28:49.903 --> 00:28:50.968
well it's not really a loving cow,

767
00:28:50.968 --> 00:28:53.490
but a nice cow is just gonna walk around

768
00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.403
because he's not evolving.

769
00:28:55.403 --> 00:28:56.065
He's not doing anything.

770
00:28:56.065 --> 00:28:58.186
He just gives a little milk, he gives a little hamburger

771
00:28:58.186 --> 00:28:59.881
and that's it, you know, that's the end of it.

772
00:29:01.541 --> 00:29:04.208
Master Kirael says that it doesn't happen that rate.

773
00:29:04.778 --> 00:29:06.971
This energy is not gonna go through the shift.

774
00:29:07.431 --> 00:29:10.569
Bummer as it may sound but that's where it is.

775
00:29:10.569 --> 00:29:12.579
So, what I'm saying to everybody is that

776
00:29:12.579 --> 00:29:16.011
if they'd start, again, if they're willing to start,

777
00:29:16.011 --> 00:29:18.330
and keep going, because this whole journey is about

778
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:23.121
what you're gonna do to satiate your own energies.

779
00:29:23.121 --> 00:29:25.445
This whole journey is about what you can,

780
00:29:25.445 --> 00:29:28.135
as I said, find something in the vegetable line

781
00:29:28.135 --> 00:29:29.317
that you can really like.

782
00:29:29.317 --> 00:29:31.939
Broccoli or whatever, and you can get behind it.

783
00:29:31.939 --> 00:29:33.461
Then eat it as much as you can,

784
00:29:34.001 --> 00:29:36.087
because what will happen, I pray,

785
00:29:36.087 --> 00:29:38.466
that we'll all get caught up to this whole journey,

786
00:29:38.466 --> 00:29:40.824
and we'll stop with the eating as much meat

787
00:29:40.824 --> 00:29:42.095
as we have in the past,

788
00:29:42.095 --> 00:29:44.127
and we just really get into the veg--

789
00:29:44.127 --> 00:29:47.712
Because, as you said, the light, the sunlight

790
00:29:47.712 --> 00:29:50.191
that grows this thing that we're supposed

791
00:29:50.191 --> 00:29:51.963
to be eating to begin with

792
00:29:51.963 --> 00:29:56.089
until our cave men came in.

793
00:29:56.759 --> 00:29:58.347
That's the JuJu right there.

794
00:29:58.347 --> 00:29:59.795
That's my stroke energy.

795
00:30:00.775 --> 00:30:02.964
The cave men came in and they decided

796
00:30:02.964 --> 00:30:04.477
to kill something and eat it.

797
00:30:04.477 --> 00:30:07.670
That's wrong, but that's what we've done.

798
00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.388
What you get is the sunlight.

799
00:30:10.388 --> 00:30:12.095
The sun is such a beautiful--

800
00:30:12.095 --> 00:30:13.539
<v Voiceover>I get that, I get that.</v>

801
00:30:13.539 --> 00:30:16.198
<v ->It comes and you're eating it, you just feel better.</v>

802
00:30:16.198 --> 00:30:18.076
You just feel better right there on the spot.

803
00:30:18.076 --> 00:30:19.922
So, that's the journey, right.

804
00:30:21.232 --> 00:30:23.075
<v Voiceover>So living in harmony with earth</v>

805
00:30:23.075 --> 00:30:26.055
as earth shifts back into the fourth-dimensional fields,

806
00:30:26.055 --> 00:30:27.880
which is well under way,

807
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.016
and we want to stay with and in harmony with that.

808
00:30:31.016 --> 00:30:34.256
Any other final thoughts about our own interaction

809
00:30:34.256 --> 00:30:36.699
with the earth itself as she makes her transition?

810
00:30:36.699 --> 00:30:39.178
<v ->Well let me say this and this is kind of a cute thing</v>

811
00:30:39.178 --> 00:30:41.519
because everybody kind of likes this, I don't know why,

812
00:30:41.519 --> 00:30:44.445
but Master Kirael said one time, 20 years ago,

813
00:30:44.445 --> 00:30:47.296
he said after the three days of darkness

814
00:30:47.296 --> 00:30:49.925
when you've all gotten up and you're shaking yourself off,

815
00:30:49.925 --> 00:30:52.705
and you realize, my God, I've made it through this shift,

816
00:30:52.705 --> 00:30:55.343
what you're gonna do is you're gonna jump in the air,

817
00:30:55.343 --> 00:30:57.990
and it's gonna take you forever to get back to the ground.

818
00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:00.556
You know, I laughed, but it's really true

819
00:31:00.556 --> 00:31:02.555
because in that three days,

820
00:31:02.555 --> 00:31:05.045
what happened to me in my three days

821
00:31:05.045 --> 00:31:09.045
has really began to make sense to me now,

822
00:31:09.045 --> 00:31:10.266
but what I'm saying to you,

823
00:31:10.266 --> 00:31:12.263
these people that float up into the air

824
00:31:12.263 --> 00:31:14.013
and then slowly come down--

825
00:31:14.013 --> 00:31:15.044
<v Voiceover>It's a density shift.</v>

826
00:31:15.044 --> 00:31:17.985
<v ->That's right because the mitochondria in the body,</v>

827
00:31:17.985 --> 00:31:20.907
the cells, is already growing right now.

828
00:31:20.907 --> 00:31:24.865
If it's not getting attacked by free radicals

829
00:31:24.865 --> 00:31:26.347
and things like these.
<v Voiceover>Toxins.</v>

830
00:31:26.347 --> 00:31:30.022
<v ->Toxins, because it's gonna get in there</v>

831
00:31:30.022 --> 00:31:31.787
and they're gonna get bigger.

832
00:31:31.787 --> 00:31:33.871
You know, I say it's gonna be this big,

833
00:31:33.871 --> 00:31:35.471
it's gonna be that big, but you know what I'm saying.

834
00:31:35.471 --> 00:31:37.023
It's so tiny you can't see it,

835
00:31:37.023 --> 00:31:39.329
but 70 trillion of them, you can feel it.

836
00:31:39.329 --> 00:31:41.639
That's what I'm trying to say to everybody.

837
00:31:41.639 --> 00:31:43.681
Just do it as right as you can.

838
00:31:43.681 --> 00:31:45.324
Don't beat up yourself.

839
00:31:45.324 --> 00:31:46.722
Please don't beat yourself up.

840
00:31:46.722 --> 00:31:48.411
You know, you're a beautiful lady

841
00:31:48.411 --> 00:31:49.885
and everything is going well for you,

842
00:31:49.885 --> 00:31:52.371
and that's beautiful,

843
00:31:52.371 --> 00:31:55.932
but the guy who's 200 pounds

844
00:31:55.932 --> 00:32:00.733
on a five foot frame and he's just a rolly polly,

845
00:32:00.733 --> 00:32:03.471
he's feeling bad when he hears this thing right here

846
00:32:03.471 --> 00:32:05.847
because I'm saying that he's got problems.

847
00:32:05.847 --> 00:32:07.926
You don't have a problem my friend.

848
00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:09.807
If you want it, you don't have to.

849
00:32:09.807 --> 00:32:11.493
You just gotta make your changes.

850
00:32:11.493 --> 00:32:16.216
Just do them slowly and be prepared

851
00:32:16.216 --> 00:32:18.475
to celebrate everything you've done.

852
00:32:18.475 --> 00:32:21.471
Celebrate everything you've done in a heartbeat

853
00:32:21.471 --> 00:32:23.541
because this is what this whole journey is about.

854
00:32:23.541 --> 00:32:27.426
If you can celebrate, if you lose an ounce next week,

855
00:32:27.426 --> 00:32:28.508
not a whole pound,

856
00:32:28.508 --> 00:32:32.139
if you look there and you're six ounces lighter,

857
00:32:32.139 --> 00:32:36.323
half a pound lighter, whatever, celebrate it.

858
00:32:36.323 --> 00:32:37.928
Tell everybody.

859
00:32:37.928 --> 00:32:40.529
Tell everybody you dropped a half a pound,

860
00:32:40.529 --> 00:32:41.994
and I'm feeling good.

861
00:32:41.994 --> 00:32:45.290
I'm telling you serious, because what you're gonna do

862
00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.386
is you're gonna microfy it, this whole journey

863
00:32:47.386 --> 00:32:51.489
is gonna be macroformed into this head,

864
00:32:51.489 --> 00:32:53.008
and you're gonna think--

865
00:32:53.008 --> 00:32:55.607
The people say, "That's very good."

866
00:32:55.607 --> 00:32:57.989
"You lost a half a pound (scoffs),"

867
00:32:57.989 --> 00:33:00.130
but they're not gonna say that for you.

868
00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:01.507
They're gonna say, "Oh that's really good,"

869
00:33:01.507 --> 00:33:03.829
and you hear it and you're gonna take it

870
00:33:03.829 --> 00:33:05.742
and you're gonna go run with it again.

871
00:33:05.742 --> 00:33:07.688
You'll run it again and again and again,

872
00:33:07.688 --> 00:33:10.380
and within just a matter of pure time,

873
00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:11.721
you're just gonna look at yourself

874
00:33:11.721 --> 00:33:12.985
in the mirror and say oh my God.

875
00:33:12.985 --> 00:33:16.038
I've lost 50 pounds and I didn't do anything.

876
00:33:16.038 --> 00:33:17.263
I didn't do anything.

877
00:33:17.263 --> 00:33:19.373
I just lost 50 pounds.

878
00:33:19.373 --> 00:33:20.839
It's that simple.

879
00:33:20.839 --> 00:33:22.073
It is that simple.

880
00:33:22.073 --> 00:33:24.588
I'm not trying to put my friends out of business,

881
00:33:24.588 --> 00:33:27.096
that have their health farms and everything,

882
00:33:27.766 --> 00:33:29.760
but it really is just that simple.

883
00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.066
So, that's what I'd offer and I thank you for your time.

884
00:33:33.066 --> 00:33:34.931
It's been really a pleasure for me.

885
00:33:34.931 --> 00:33:37.263
<v Voiceover>It's been a total pleasure for me.</v>

886
00:33:37.263 --> 00:33:38.492
A wild ride.

887
00:33:38.492 --> 00:33:39.641
<v ->A wild ride.</v>

888
00:33:39.641 --> 00:33:40.657
<v Voiceover>Thank you so much,</v>

889
00:33:40.657 --> 00:33:41.587
<v ->God bless you.
<v Voiceover>Kahu.</v>

890
00:33:41.587 --> 00:33:42.657
<v ->Thank you.</v>
