00:00:00.245 --> 00:00:02.005
<v ->For those of you who watched our last interview</v>

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:03.745
with Michael Horn, you will certainly want

3
00:00:03.745 --> 00:00:05.265
to follow up with this one.

4
00:00:05.265 --> 00:00:07.925
Michael is the English liaison for the enigmatic

5
00:00:07.925 --> 00:00:10.265
and profound works of Billy Meier.

6
00:00:10.265 --> 00:00:12.345
In this second part of our conversation,

7
00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:14.445
Michael delves into the more controversial

8
00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:17.445
and challenging subjects that require an open mind

9
00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:19.685
and genuine spirit of inquiry.

10
00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:21.560
In the end, one should only accept

11
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.380
what feels true in our own hearts.

12
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.910 line:15% 
(relaxing spiritual music)

13
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.400
<v Regina>We're going to pick up our conversation</v>

14
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.720
with the actual life lessons, so to speak,

15
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.060
that have come through to Billy Meier

16
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.280
through the decades,

17
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.380
that we would be wise to start paying attention to now

18
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.140
because we're in dicey times.

19
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.740
Everything, as it appears now, looks like it might

20
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.220
get dicier before it gets more pleasant again.

21
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.220
So, that said, let's talk about,

22
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.140
we have to talk about the population on the planet.

23
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.920
I know they're really big on that.

24
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.600
Let's just launch into the notion

25
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.160
of the fact that this, according to the Plejarens,

26
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.820
planet is overpopulated.

27
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.920
<v ->Hugely.</v>

28
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.940
Now, they claim for a planet this size,

29
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.960
sustainability, and abundance, and prosperity

30
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.480
would be, if the population of the planet was

31
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.920
a half a billion.

32
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.820
So we're going, wait a minute, we almost have

33
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.380
that many people in this country,

34
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.670
and maybe put in Canada, and what have you.

35
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.440
It's a hot issue for a lot of people for various reasons.

36
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.080
Probably mainly because religions have used overpopulation,

37
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.940
just go forth and multiply, multiply, multiply,

38
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.320
as a means of enriching themselves and their coffers

39
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.200
with no regard for the consequences to people

40
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.620
who then find themselves with many children

41
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.700
who they're unable to support, etecetera.

42
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.480
We all could reason our way through this

43
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.280
if we would reason.

44
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.960
The intensity of overpopulation

45
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.500
accounts for the majority of problems of the planet.

46
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.260
Whereas, if we were not overpopulated and more reasonable,

47
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.940
which would be enhanced and encouraged

48
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.260
by our not being on top of each other constantly

49
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.880
with this friction and the friction on our world,

50
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.500
our society, our environment,

51
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.700
we could solve, we could even prevent

52
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.040
many problems from arising,

53
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.960
because we wouldn't be in this consumption madness,

54
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.020
we wouldn't be burning the very synovial fluid of the planet

55
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.360
for fuel.

56
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.030
Darkening our skies, polluting our air,

57
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.870
and imbalancing our tectonic plate structure

58
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.610
so that the forthcoming mega quakes, volcanic eruptions,

59
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.430
and as Meier puts it, disappearance of

60
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.990
whole parts of continents and sinking of islands,

61
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.390
would have been avoided.

62
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.170
But we, in our know-it-all-ism,

63
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.570
decide we will wrench the last drop of anything

64
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.710
out of the planet and ignore logic and reason.

65
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.090
Now, people who say, see they want to kill everybody off,

66
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.990
they misunderstand.

67
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.030
There's no prescription here for killing people off.

68
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.370
We're doing that to ourselves.

69
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.530
<v Regina>But, the reason I thought,</v>

70
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.470
I debated whether to bring that up now or later

71
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.370
because this gets into some really complex stuff.

72
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.470
You start looking at a lot of other evidence that exists,

73
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.190
you start looking at more in the conspiratorial,

74
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.270
I don't like that word, but on the other side,

75
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.070
on the other side where you're looking at doctrines

76
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.490
toward world depopulation that have surfaced.

77
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.030
You're talking about some well-known players

78
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.590
that have been involved in this and continue to be.

79
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.010
It's said that the reason they're targeting

80
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.690
that half a billion number is because of

81
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.445
what the Plejarens have said.

82
00:03:42.445 --> 00:03:44.725
I don't think that's true because it came before that,

83
00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:46.285
but nonetheless, you're talking about some

84
00:03:46.285 --> 00:03:48.545
rather nefarious plans for reducing the population

85
00:03:48.545 --> 00:03:50.445
of the planet that do exist.

86
00:03:50.445 --> 00:03:53.125
<v ->Or allegedly exist.</v>

87
00:03:53.125 --> 00:03:54.425
Now let's use an idea here,

88
00:03:54.425 --> 00:03:56.785
because people sometimes mix a lot of things together.

89
00:03:56.785 --> 00:04:00.785
Let's remember that Hitler was a vegetarian.

90
00:04:00.785 --> 00:04:04.145
So all the vegetarians today, if we take

91
00:04:04.145 --> 00:04:06.005
the kind of thinking that a lot of people want

92
00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:08.105
to mix and match,

93
00:04:08.105 --> 00:04:10.165
if you're a vegetarian, you probably endorse

94
00:04:10.165 --> 00:04:11.185
the ideas of Hitler.

95
00:04:11.185 --> 00:04:12.860
Well of course those are nonsensical things.

96
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.560
There are people that, let's just say,

97
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.220
that there are nefarious plans, or at least beliefs

98
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.580
that there are nefarious plans

99
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.800
to rid the planet of all but a half a billion people,

100
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.920
somehow magically in a pristine manner

101
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.120
so that the ruling elite or whatever have it that way.

102
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.080
Of course, wouldn't make them efficient slavemasters

103
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.680
over masses of people that they're also alleged to be.

104
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.600
Here's the idea.

105
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.980
There are means of reducing population

106
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.600
and increasing population, according to the Plejaren,

107
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.980
that are accord with natural law.

108
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.640
And there are means of reducing the planet's population

109
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.655
that will be the result of a violation of natural law.

110
00:04:53.655 --> 00:04:55.695
<v Regina>Okay, that's a good distinction,</v>

111
00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:57.935
and it would be maybe,

112
00:04:57.935 --> 00:05:00.055
well it's not up for you to have to explain

113
00:05:00.055 --> 00:05:01.855
what all these other interests may or may not

114
00:05:01.855 --> 00:05:03.215
have in mind, or...

115
00:05:03.215 --> 00:05:04.695
<v ->If they're even real or not.</v>

116
00:05:04.695 --> 00:05:05.955
<v Regina>If they're real or if they're not,</v>

117
00:05:05.955 --> 00:05:08.635
I'm not trying to put you in that hot seat,

118
00:05:08.635 --> 00:05:11.095
but the point is that same number

119
00:05:11.095 --> 00:05:13.675
keeps coming up, no matter which way I go,

120
00:05:13.675 --> 00:05:15.355
the same number keeps coming up,

121
00:05:15.355 --> 00:05:17.575
so who knows if it's kind of bastardized information

122
00:05:17.575 --> 00:05:18.855
that's been passed on,

123
00:05:18.855 --> 00:05:20.355
who knows if there are actually,

124
00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:23.135
are a number of plans, I don't know,

125
00:05:23.135 --> 00:05:25.115
and they wouldn't be within nature,

126
00:05:25.115 --> 00:05:27.225
they would be against nature,

127
00:05:27.225 --> 00:05:29.255
and I do believe that.

128
00:05:29.255 --> 00:05:31.455
Now, the second question,

129
00:05:31.455 --> 00:05:32.575
I just wanted to put that on the table

130
00:05:32.575 --> 00:05:34.415
because a lot of our viewers will automatically

131
00:05:34.415 --> 00:05:36.285
red flag goes up, yeah.

132
00:05:36.285 --> 00:05:39.750
Now, this next question is

133
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.750
would the planet be able to sustain

134
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.790
a healthy state with this number of people

135
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.410
that we currently have, for example,

136
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.710
if we understood the laws of nature,

137
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.050
if we had clean energy sources,

138
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.810
and we understand how to grow food again,

139
00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.970
and, you hear what I'm saying?

140
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:01.970
<v ->Sure, sure.</v>

141
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.230
My understanding is this.

142
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.210
The answer may be still no,

143
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.250
because of the sheer numbers of people,

144
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.550
the way in which diseases are spread

145
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.450
through immigration, tourism, and other factors,

146
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.210
the overexposure of everything,

147
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.150
the overcultivation of the land

148
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.630
to try to feed these masses of people,

149
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.510
as well as, of course, the faulty distribution

150
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.130
that doesn't make it available where it could be.

151
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.090
We simply have too many people

152
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.090
and for natural comfort, we create psychic disturbances

153
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.910
through the concentrated living that we do in cities,

154
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.330
as well as the physical overbuilding

155
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.730
of masses like big cities and dams

156
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.710
that contribute to the danger of these earthquakes

157
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.190
and things that occur, or are coming.

158
00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:01.190
We would be wise to allow and assist,

159
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.210
through natural means, and I don't mean

160
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.490
any form of euthanasia, just letting,

161
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.550
for instance, this is a hot button,

162
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.505
the Plejaren information claimed that,

163
00:07:10.505 --> 00:07:13.785
in many cases, when people are in these horrible famines

164
00:07:13.785 --> 00:07:16.415
like they've been in some parts of Africa or Asia,

165
00:07:16.415 --> 00:07:19.525
to come rushing in with all this food and aid

166
00:07:19.525 --> 00:07:21.465
is actually anti-humane.

167
00:07:21.465 --> 00:07:23.445
Where people have stripped their land

168
00:07:23.445 --> 00:07:25.625
of their forests and their trees and the rest of it,

169
00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:27.265
where they've burned their trees for fireweood

170
00:07:27.265 --> 00:07:29.365
and now they're dying because they haven't been able

171
00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:32.325
to grow food, the Plejaren is saying,

172
00:07:32.325 --> 00:07:35.245
make people comfortable, but allow them

173
00:07:35.245 --> 00:07:40.245
to depopulate themselves, certainly to a level

174
00:07:40.605 --> 00:07:45.605
where they can sustain and begin to come back up.

175
00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:48.865
Otherwise, we have all the charities

176
00:07:48.865 --> 00:07:52.725
with their dubious benefit in many cases,

177
00:07:52.725 --> 00:07:55.665
some benefit of course, are pumping millions

178
00:07:55.665 --> 00:07:57.705
or at least extracting millions of dollars

179
00:07:57.705 --> 00:07:59.325
and sending stuff.

180
00:07:59.325 --> 00:08:01.465
We haven't solved poverty and starvation,

181
00:08:01.465 --> 00:08:05.465
because we have a false humaneness in place.

182
00:08:05.465 --> 00:08:07.420
We talk about this thing of illegal immigration,

183
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.820
which is nothing personal against anybody,

184
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.560
it simply means there's a mechanism in place

185
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.360
that when people who have not solved their own problems

186
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.200
rush into other countries to take advantage

187
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.140
of the benefits that those people have worked hard to build

188
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.340
they cannot help but degrade that society.

189
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.580
In many cases, we can see in our own state

190
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.020
of California, the places start to bankrupt

191
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.980
the very systems, educationally and medically,

192
00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.900
that the people who have paid into them

193
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.400
are entitled to use.

194
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.560
Then you get polarized because people who don't know better

195
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.040
in many cases, then become the scapegoats.

196
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.520
Some of them become criminals.

197
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.560
It's such a complex thing because we don't understand

198
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.160
the way you help people is you help them to help themselves

199
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.760
as above, so below, to bring themselves up to the levels

200
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.740
of prosperity, education, everything else, health and all,

201
00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.820
that they would aspire to have for themselves,

202
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.000
and in the process, you have to confront things

203
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.880
like the Catholic Church in South America, Mexico,

204
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.880
and other places, which keeps people barefoot,

205
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.620
and pregnant, and happy, so that the coffers can be filled,

206
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.220
and people can have to struggle with these

207
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.800
ever expanding families.

208
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.800
So overpopulation, it's here because we have thoughtlessly

209
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.000
not only allowed, but encouraged.

210
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.660
We don't understand the balance of nature.

211
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:27.100
You reintroduce, the Plejaren have a means of reintroducing

212
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.440
more births into a population when it needs it

213
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.660
through an alphabetical, staggered means.

214
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.020
That's explained in the Meier material as well.

215
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.300
We're far from being even able, for the most part,

216
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.760
to have the common sense to look at this information.

217
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.060
<v Regina>Yes, but it is, in a sense,</v>

218
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:49.060
it's obvious in that, again, if we can depersonalize

219
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.960
the notion of our own survival.

220
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.960
As you were saying, when you have continents

221
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.700
that have been stripped dry and exploited

222
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.200
every which way by outsiders and insiders alike,

223
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.720
so that they're no longer able to support life,

224
00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.540
well it's not a good idea to keep introducting

225
00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.300
populations into these areas.

226
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.200
I do understand what you're saying there.

227
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.080
On one hand, we don't want a monochromatic

228
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.980
sort of species, so to speak,

229
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.360
but on the other hand, how do you logically deal with this?

230
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.160
And I'm just saying, I do understand this,

231
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.260
because if we come around and around,

232
00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.020
this is just another incarnation.

233
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:29.420
We're living at a time where we're watching the effects

234
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.500
come to full fruition of our past beliefs and behaviors

235
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.420
and so forth.

236
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.720
Now we have to deal with them.

237
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.940
A lot of people are going to die. We're all going to die.

238
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.015
So we have to get over that.

239
00:10:39.015 --> 00:10:40.815
I mean, yes, if someone we love dies,

240
00:10:40.815 --> 00:10:42.155
it's horrible, we mourn.

241
00:10:42.155 --> 00:10:45.315
If we die, we're either pissed off

242
00:10:45.315 --> 00:10:46.855
or we're mourning that as well,

243
00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:48.975
but it's okay, we'll be back.

244
00:10:48.975 --> 00:10:51.675
<v ->I've got a saying about that, reincarnation.</v>

245
00:10:51.675 --> 00:10:55.035
Don't worry about dying, you'll live through it.

246
00:10:55.035 --> 00:10:56.355
And then a friend of mind added,

247
00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:59.395
so make the world a better place to come back to.

248
00:10:59.395 --> 00:11:04.395
<v Regina>Exactly, and personally I'm on that page.</v>

249
00:11:04.815 --> 00:11:08.935
So we do have to stop sentimentalizing a lot of this

250
00:11:08.935 --> 00:11:11.215
and deal with the problems, because we are going to

251
00:11:11.215 --> 00:11:13.515
inherit the Earth, right?

252
00:11:13.515 --> 00:11:15.335
Or at least I believe we're going to inherit the Earth.

253
00:11:15.335 --> 00:11:19.115
<v ->Well, it's speculative, but let's act as if we're going to</v>

254
00:11:19.115 --> 00:11:21.835
and then we won't leave it a mess for the next generation,

255
00:11:21.835 --> 00:11:22.915
whoever that may be.

256
00:11:22.915 --> 00:11:24.775
<v Regina>Yes, so we have to</v>

257
00:11:24.775 --> 00:11:29.135
desentimentalize our attachment to virtually everything

258
00:11:29.135 --> 00:11:31.375
in the view of the larger picture,

259
00:11:31.375 --> 00:11:33.935
which is we've got to get our planet healthy again,

260
00:11:33.935 --> 00:11:35.575
and we've got to get the species healthy again,

261
00:11:35.575 --> 00:11:39.195
so there I can understand, until we're much wiser

262
00:11:39.195 --> 00:11:43.095
in how to care for ourselves and how not to treat the Earth

263
00:11:43.095 --> 00:11:45.555
so that we can have a plentiful environment,

264
00:11:45.555 --> 00:11:48.815
that letting our population reduce itself

265
00:11:48.815 --> 00:11:50.555
would probably not be a bad idea.

266
00:11:50.555 --> 00:11:53.095
We don't need interference from anyone to help us with that.

267
00:11:53.095 --> 00:11:55.615
First of all, we're becoming infertile

268
00:11:55.615 --> 00:11:57.655
through all of the toxins and so forth.

269
00:11:57.655 --> 00:11:59.935
<v ->That's nature's way of saying no, no, no.</v>

270
00:11:59.935 --> 00:12:00.915
<v Regina>That's right, and that's</v>

271
00:12:00.915 --> 00:12:02.315
going to play it's own hand in it.

272
00:12:02.315 --> 00:12:05.695
Is there anything else on a more illuminated level, per se,

273
00:12:05.695 --> 00:12:09.414
that the Plejarens had to say about allowing our Earth

274
00:12:09.414 --> 00:12:12.174
to go to a more manageable population,

275
00:12:12.174 --> 00:12:14.914
that's within natural laws, not within violence

276
00:12:14.914 --> 00:12:17.094
and usuriousness, and greed?

277
00:12:17.094 --> 00:12:19.074
<v ->You know, um...</v>

278
00:12:19.074 --> 00:12:21.794
<v Regina>Besides to just stop having a lot of kids.</v>

279
00:12:21.794 --> 00:12:24.354
<v ->Well you know, basically,</v>

280
00:12:24.354 --> 00:12:27.854
if you're overpopulated, reduce your population,

281
00:12:27.854 --> 00:12:30.654
stop, they say stop births.

282
00:12:30.654 --> 00:12:31.954
I mean basically they're saying,

283
00:12:31.954 --> 00:12:33.334
you should stop your births.

284
00:12:33.334 --> 00:12:34.834
Now a lot of people say, we don't have enough

285
00:12:34.834 --> 00:12:36.494
of this group here or that group there or anything else.

286
00:12:36.494 --> 00:12:39.134
Well, maybe in some areas, you need a few more people,

287
00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:41.614
but for the most part, we don't.

288
00:12:41.614 --> 00:12:45.594
We need to, if we focused on taking care of each other,

289
00:12:45.594 --> 00:12:50.594
health became, not a fanaticism, but a reasonable priority,

290
00:12:50.974 --> 00:12:54.494
because it's an investment in the prosperity of the society.

291
00:12:54.494 --> 00:12:59.494
If we had the basic common sense, let alone wisdom,

292
00:13:00.434 --> 00:13:03.334
to say that spending billions and trillions of dollars

293
00:13:03.334 --> 00:13:07.354
to kill people because we want to possess their resources

294
00:13:07.354 --> 00:13:09.274
or we don't like what they believe, or what have you,

295
00:13:09.274 --> 00:13:14.274
is not quite as wise as, having good defense, first off,

296
00:13:14.654 --> 00:13:16.714
take care of ourselves, but to put those resources

297
00:13:16.714 --> 00:13:19.474
back into becoming the best, healthiest, happiest

298
00:13:19.474 --> 00:13:20.834
human beings we can be,

299
00:13:20.834 --> 00:13:23.994
and become the shining example that the propagandists

300
00:13:23.994 --> 00:13:27.194
would like to think we are hated for being,

301
00:13:27.194 --> 00:13:29.574
which is not the case.

302
00:13:29.574 --> 00:13:30.714
We are not hated for our freedom,

303
00:13:30.714 --> 00:13:33.594
we are hated for interfering with other people's freedoms.

304
00:13:33.594 --> 00:13:35.674
Any thinking person sees that.

305
00:13:35.674 --> 00:13:37.394
And even some of those non-thinking people

306
00:13:37.394 --> 00:13:42.394
are now having to reconsider in the face of current events

307
00:13:42.554 --> 00:13:45.374
recorded in this moment, we know we're in trouble.

308
00:13:45.374 --> 00:13:48.874
We are entering an age of knowledge

309
00:13:48.874 --> 00:13:53.054
and leaving behind the age of beliefs.

310
00:13:53.054 --> 00:13:56.094
So all of the things that we can look at,

311
00:13:56.094 --> 00:13:57.734
we must look past our beliefs,

312
00:13:57.734 --> 00:13:59.674
when you said, personally,

313
00:13:59.674 --> 00:14:03.734
and this will lead us to the idea of how to think

314
00:14:03.734 --> 00:14:06.934
and what we're being told is truly our quote, unquote,

315
00:14:06.934 --> 00:14:10.154
"salvation," which comes from us and nobody else.

316
00:14:10.154 --> 00:14:11.954
<v Regina>Right, for our innate knowledge.</v>

317
00:14:11.954 --> 00:14:16.954
Let's go into the notion of non-judgment,

318
00:14:17.074 --> 00:14:20.614
cause and effect, a couple of broad subjects, yes.

319
00:14:20.614 --> 00:14:22.794
<v ->Non-judgment is a mistake.</v>

320
00:14:22.794 --> 00:14:24.674
That's a New Age idea.

321
00:14:24.674 --> 00:14:27.714
It came out of Christianity, perhaps,

322
00:14:27.714 --> 00:14:30.034
where the teachings of Emmanuel,

323
00:14:30.034 --> 00:14:33.389
who we falsely called Jesus, were themselves falsified.

324
00:14:33.389 --> 00:14:35.829
When the original admonition was not,

325
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:37.609
"Judge not, lest ye be judged,"

326
00:14:37.609 --> 00:14:42.049
it was, "Judge not falsely, lest ye be judged."

327
00:14:42.049 --> 00:14:44.329
<v Regina>That sounds to me like discernment.</v>

328
00:14:44.329 --> 00:14:46.669
Discernment is different than judgment.

329
00:14:46.669 --> 00:14:49.569
<v ->Well, I don't know, I think we all make judgments.</v>

330
00:14:49.569 --> 00:14:50.969
We judge a thing a certain way,

331
00:14:50.969 --> 00:14:53.929
and judgment in itself is a word that we use

332
00:14:53.929 --> 00:14:57.629
to decide, or to judge a thing.

333
00:14:57.629 --> 00:14:59.469
It isn't that it's a bad thing in itself.

334
00:14:59.469 --> 00:15:02.909
We may make wrong judgments,

335
00:15:02.909 --> 00:15:06.249
but we also may judge accurately.

336
00:15:06.249 --> 00:15:07.509
<v Regina>So you're just saying the falseness</v>

337
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:09.609
is the element that needs to be eliminated.

338
00:15:09.609 --> 00:15:12.309
<v ->Yeah, we mustn't, see this whole notion,</v>

339
00:15:12.309 --> 00:15:16.049
and if you look politically, we're liberals, let's say,

340
00:15:16.049 --> 00:15:17.619
and there's conservatives.

341
00:15:17.619 --> 00:15:19.969
Conservatives fault liberals.

342
00:15:19.969 --> 00:15:22.169
We tend to see the liberals as being,

343
00:15:22.169 --> 00:15:24.269
we're nonjudgmental.

344
00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:25.989
That's a dangerous place to be.

345
00:15:25.989 --> 00:15:28.689
And you may be falsely judgmental over here.

346
00:15:28.689 --> 00:15:32.149
So what we're encouraged to look at here is,

347
00:15:32.149 --> 00:15:37.149
use thinking, rationality, reason to form your judgments.

348
00:15:38.729 --> 00:15:42.929
Don't reject judgment or make your judgments

349
00:15:42.929 --> 00:15:46.509
on the basis of beliefs, that's foolishness.

350
00:15:46.509 --> 00:15:49.179
But go ahead and judge, discern.

351
00:15:49.179 --> 00:15:52.529
They are very clear and harsh in their language.

352
00:15:52.529 --> 00:15:54.169
They judge us quite harshly.

353
00:15:54.169 --> 00:15:56.009
<v Regina>Yes, I've noticed that in the language.</v>

354
00:15:56.009 --> 00:15:57.929
<v ->Because they say the truth cannot be told</v>

355
00:15:57.929 --> 00:15:59.469
in flowery words.

356
00:15:59.469 --> 00:16:01.229
We can have a nice discussion about this

357
00:16:01.229 --> 00:16:04.349
and present information, representing as accurately

358
00:16:04.349 --> 00:16:06.769
as possible, the facts as I know them in the case.

359
00:16:06.769 --> 00:16:10.949
But they are saying, you people lie to yourselves so badly.

360
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:13.809
I was talking to Billy about three, four years ago,

361
00:16:13.809 --> 00:16:16.469
and I said, I think that the Plejaren didn't understand us,

362
00:16:16.469 --> 00:16:18.449
because I'm familiar with a lot of this

363
00:16:18.449 --> 00:16:19.749
English language stuff,

364
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:21.669
and they are misperceiving some things here.

365
00:16:21.669 --> 00:16:23.609
But he says that's the truth of the matter.

366
00:16:23.609 --> 00:16:27.049
Unfortunately, he said, they did not,

367
00:16:27.049 --> 00:16:29.269
first of all he said they were not allowed

368
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:32.729
to look into us individually too deeply.

369
00:16:32.729 --> 00:16:35.789
For a long time, this was to not invade our free will

370
00:16:35.789 --> 00:16:37.089
and our privacy.

371
00:16:37.089 --> 00:16:39.989
And though they should have known better, perhaps,

372
00:16:39.989 --> 00:16:43.389
they were surprised at the degree of lying

373
00:16:43.389 --> 00:16:48.389
that we engage in with ourselves as well as each other.

374
00:16:49.349 --> 00:16:50.989
And they were stunned that,

375
00:16:50.989 --> 00:16:55.849
because to them, lying is not only wrong, it's illogical.

376
00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:58.509
Why? Well, when you lie,

377
00:16:58.509 --> 00:17:02.469
you don't change the facts, you compound

378
00:17:02.469 --> 00:17:05.249
the negativity of the consequences

379
00:17:05.249 --> 00:17:08.309
of when that little ball of cause and effect comes back.

380
00:17:08.309 --> 00:17:09.889
<v Regina>That's where we're going next.</v>

381
00:17:09.889 --> 00:17:12.829
That leads to cause and effect.

382
00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:17.189
So if you're going to deceive yourself,

383
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:19.569
let's forget about deceiving others,

384
00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:21.269
if you're going to deceive yourself, you're right,

385
00:17:21.269 --> 00:17:22.829
you've really muddled it,

386
00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:26.249
for getting any clear reflection of the process

387
00:17:26.249 --> 00:17:27.829
of cause and effect.

388
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:29.429
And cause and effect is really big here

389
00:17:29.429 --> 00:17:31.209
which is part of self-responsibility,

390
00:17:31.209 --> 00:17:34.709
so let's now move right into what the Plejarens say

391
00:17:34.709 --> 00:17:35.729
about cause and effect,

392
00:17:35.729 --> 00:17:37.609
which often is confused with karma.

393
00:17:37.609 --> 00:17:40.669
Sometimes the words are loosely woven together.

394
00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:42.569
<v ->They're not big on what we consider karma,</v>

395
00:17:42.569 --> 00:17:44.729
but let's go to the cause and effect.

396
00:17:44.729 --> 00:17:46.909
Cause and effect is actually big everywhere

397
00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:49.809
because it's a universal law of operation.

398
00:17:49.809 --> 00:17:51.689
And it's a dumb law.

399
00:17:51.689 --> 00:17:54.349
It doesn't care whether you're an American,

400
00:17:54.349 --> 00:17:58.209
or you're a Russian, Israeli, Chinese, Vietnamese.

401
00:17:58.209 --> 00:18:02.649
It is an equal opportunity offender if you violate.

402
00:18:02.649 --> 00:18:06.429
And of course, we are meant to learn through our mistakes,

403
00:18:06.429 --> 00:18:07.729
so we're going to make mistakes,

404
00:18:07.729 --> 00:18:10.329
and it doesn't mean that we need blame ourselves,

405
00:18:10.329 --> 00:18:13.409
excessively anyhow, for all the stumbling and bumbling

406
00:18:13.409 --> 00:18:16.089
that we do, and the fact that the pendulum,

407
00:18:16.089 --> 00:18:17.689
or the wrecking ball, occasionally comes back

408
00:18:17.689 --> 00:18:18.969
and cleans our clock.

409
00:18:18.969 --> 00:18:20.929
However, the way it's coming back on us now,

410
00:18:20.929 --> 00:18:22.429
and particularly in the United States,

411
00:18:22.429 --> 00:18:25.189
as well as other countries, but I'm concerned here.

412
00:18:25.189 --> 00:18:27.549
We will, and we are beginning to see

413
00:18:27.549 --> 00:18:29.449
the wrecking ball come through.

414
00:18:29.449 --> 00:18:32.989
We still can prevent or mitigate, soften some of the blows,

415
00:18:32.989 --> 00:18:35.909
but some is not alterable at this point,

416
00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:38.069
because we've gone past the point of no return

417
00:18:38.069 --> 00:18:41.069
where the prophecy turns into prediction.

418
00:18:41.069 --> 00:18:42.489
So with cause and effect,

419
00:18:42.489 --> 00:18:46.029
we are made familiar with it such as

420
00:18:46.029 --> 00:18:48.469
what you send out comes back.

421
00:18:48.469 --> 00:18:52.009
As you sew, thus shall you reap.

422
00:18:52.009 --> 00:18:54.249
Even the one, as a person thinketh in their heart,

423
00:18:54.249 --> 00:18:56.579
so they become.

424
00:18:58.409 --> 00:19:00.009
There are these very permutations

425
00:19:00.009 --> 00:19:01.429
of the law of cause and effect.

426
00:19:01.429 --> 00:19:05.369
Do unto others as you'd have them do unto you.

427
00:19:05.369 --> 00:19:06.869
Some people say, do unto others

428
00:19:06.869 --> 00:19:09.809
as you would like to be done unto yourself, whatever.

429
00:19:09.809 --> 00:19:12.249
The point is that everything we do,

430
00:19:12.249 --> 00:19:14.969
every thought, every feeling, and every action

431
00:19:14.969 --> 00:19:18.089
are causal on some level, and have an effect.

432
00:19:18.089 --> 00:19:20.709
Some are quite minor, let's say.

433
00:19:20.709 --> 00:19:22.569
Some we kinda catch on in time,

434
00:19:22.569 --> 00:19:24.269
and we make course corrections.

435
00:19:24.269 --> 00:19:27.249
And some produce cataclysmic results.

436
00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:29.609
Some causes we have nothing to do with,

437
00:19:29.609 --> 00:19:31.909
like a meteor coming from the depths of space,

438
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:33.889
let's just say, has an effect.

439
00:19:33.889 --> 00:19:37.889
But we, once we can perceive the incoming,

440
00:19:37.889 --> 00:19:41.449
inbound object, we might take some causal action ourself

441
00:19:41.449 --> 00:19:44.529
to try to alter that if we can intercept

442
00:19:44.529 --> 00:19:45.889
and intercede in time.

443
00:19:45.889 --> 00:19:50.250
So cause and effect leads us to a lot of places,

444
00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:52.369
so that when we say that every thought,

445
00:19:52.369 --> 00:19:55.869
every feeling, and every action has its effect,

446
00:19:55.869 --> 00:20:00.149
we are, within ourselves, responsible for every thought,

447
00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:02.409
and every feeling, and every action we take.

448
00:20:02.409 --> 00:20:04.549
We all are going to make mistakes until

449
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:08.529
billions of years from now in the course of this evolution,

450
00:20:08.529 --> 00:20:12.229
but we've been given a simple key in the Meier material,

451
00:20:12.229 --> 00:20:15.649
and in a sense it's not even unique to the Meier material.

452
00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:18.149
In many ways we've been told and taught these things

453
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:20.869
through various traditions of meditation, what have you.

454
00:20:20.869 --> 00:20:22.649
Some of which may have had their origins

455
00:20:22.649 --> 00:20:24.489
with extraterrestrials, it doesn't matter.

456
00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:27.309
If it's good and useful, if it's a tool you use it,

457
00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:29.309
and it doesn't always have to be connected

458
00:20:29.309 --> 00:20:31.189
to extraterrestrials and UFOs.

459
00:20:31.189 --> 00:20:32.324
What are we gonna do with that?

460
00:20:32.324 --> 00:20:36.224
But here is what this part of the teaching is.

461
00:20:36.224 --> 00:20:40.384
Monitor your thoughts 24 hours a day.

462
00:20:40.384 --> 00:20:43.784
Now they are not proponents of positive thinking.

463
00:20:43.784 --> 00:20:47.344
They're proponents of neutral positive thinking,

464
00:20:47.344 --> 00:20:50.124
meaning in order to be in reality,

465
00:20:50.124 --> 00:20:52.784
and to create the preferred realities,

466
00:20:52.784 --> 00:20:55.204
we have to know what is.

467
00:20:55.204 --> 00:20:57.644
Which also means we have to know what's going on

468
00:20:57.644 --> 00:20:59.104
inside our heads.

469
00:20:59.104 --> 00:21:01.244
What are those tapes, and those loops,

470
00:21:01.244 --> 00:21:03.004
and those images, and those impulses,

471
00:21:03.004 --> 00:21:06.824
and those things buried in our subnoxious minds

472
00:21:06.824 --> 00:21:08.024
and the rest of it?

473
00:21:08.024 --> 00:21:10.784
Well, by being attentive to that,

474
00:21:10.784 --> 00:21:13.684
and knowing our motivation, we start to,

475
00:21:13.684 --> 00:21:16.944
person, man, human, know thyself.

476
00:21:16.944 --> 00:21:19.504
That is the first and most important thing.

477
00:21:19.504 --> 00:21:22.944
So as we observe each thought,

478
00:21:22.944 --> 00:21:25.579
we have the opportunity,

479
00:21:25.579 --> 00:21:27.659
and actually the responsibility

480
00:21:27.659 --> 00:21:29.474
to determine whether we will continue

481
00:21:29.474 --> 00:21:33.794
to perpetuate those thoughts.

482
00:21:33.794 --> 00:21:38.294
Or if we are going to modify, alter, eliminate, replace.

483
00:21:38.294 --> 00:21:41.014
But first we have to become aware of

484
00:21:41.014 --> 00:21:43.794
the elephant in the room, which is in the head.

485
00:21:43.794 --> 00:21:45.974
I'm a novice at this, we all are.

486
00:21:45.974 --> 00:21:48.434
As we become aware of what we're thinking,

487
00:21:48.434 --> 00:21:52.274
the next step is this idea of choice.

488
00:21:52.274 --> 00:21:57.274
I have a DVD that's out called Standing in Spirit.

489
00:21:58.874 --> 00:22:01.254
This was a technique that I developed,

490
00:22:01.254 --> 00:22:04.334
that came upon me about 1990,

491
00:22:04.334 --> 00:22:07.434
and Meier and FIGU have said,

492
00:22:07.434 --> 00:22:09.854
please teach this at the end of each workshop

493
00:22:09.854 --> 00:22:12.034
because it's a means of doing

494
00:22:12.034 --> 00:22:14.094
what we are encouraging people to do.

495
00:22:14.094 --> 00:22:16.594
Because it's also a means of identifying

496
00:22:16.594 --> 00:22:21.194
the emotional content which so colors each of us,

497
00:22:21.194 --> 00:22:24.254
which prejudices us, affects us, paralyzes us,

498
00:22:24.254 --> 00:22:25.694
enrages us, etcetera,

499
00:22:25.694 --> 00:22:29.614
and to consciously, in a conscious means,

500
00:22:29.614 --> 00:22:33.874
and in a safe means, identify our own content

501
00:22:33.874 --> 00:22:36.534
through observation, and through a process,

502
00:22:36.534 --> 00:22:39.294
a simple, non-mystical process,

503
00:22:39.294 --> 00:22:44.294
begin to discharge and, what's the best way of putting it,

504
00:22:44.894 --> 00:22:48.654
eliminate, to the best possible degree,

505
00:22:48.654 --> 00:22:52.514
dissipate these charges that have been lingering

506
00:22:52.514 --> 00:22:56.774
and lurking within us from very early parts of our life

507
00:22:56.774 --> 00:23:01.534
that we have then made immortal unconsciously

508
00:23:01.534 --> 00:23:03.454
as protective defense mechanisms,

509
00:23:03.454 --> 00:23:06.814
and this has led to our neurotic behavior,

510
00:23:06.814 --> 00:23:09.874
to our psychotic behavior in many cases,

511
00:23:09.874 --> 00:23:12.994
and we are the embodiment of a lot of dysfunction.

512
00:23:12.994 --> 00:23:15.594
It's not to shame ourselves,

513
00:23:15.594 --> 00:23:19.694
it's simply, the opportunity comes thought by thought,

514
00:23:19.694 --> 00:23:22.694
breath by breath, to begin to become aware

515
00:23:22.694 --> 00:23:25.254
and to change these mechanisms.

516
00:23:25.254 --> 00:23:29.434
By doing so, we start to resonate in, let's just call,

517
00:23:29.434 --> 00:23:33.754
psychically, emotionally, intellectually clearer ways,

518
00:23:33.754 --> 00:23:38.520
which then has a way of attracting us to others

519
00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.720
and others to us who are on their own pursuit.

520
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.020
Doesn't have to be all about this particular teaching here,

521
00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.460
as good as I think it is,

522
00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:49.300
but others who are focused on wanting to find the truth.

523
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.260
Not belief, truth and knowledge, wisdom, understanding.

524
00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.920
Not belief.

525
00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:57.780
So we then start to connect up a matrix

526
00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:00.580
of like-intended, like-minded in some ways,

527
00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.020
but like-intended, like-focused people.

528
00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.260
We're not simply sitting around

529
00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.740
looking longingly into each other's eyes

530
00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:10.300
and trying to figure out if they were tied together

531
00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:14.940
in China in 600 A.D., but rather

532
00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.400
focusing in the same direction.

533
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:22.060
Because unlike our politically, religiously oriented world,

534
00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.920
which is all advantage oriented,

535
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.100
especially politics, and religion too,

536
00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.780
politics is not the art of the possible,

537
00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.700
it's the art of advantage wherein we slug each other

538
00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.380
over the head to gain advantage over each other,

539
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.380
and through this compromise,

540
00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.700
set in motion the law of cause and effect

541
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.880
which guarantees that we will receive

542
00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.500
the opposite of any good intention

543
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.740
because there will be always disadvantaged parties

544
00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.600
who will then also have to try to climb over the bodies

545
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.580
and make the compromises and sell off

546
00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:54.520
and gain the advantages to reclaim, etcetera.

547
00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:58.680
So when we find what are the genuine operating principles

548
00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.520
of life and of human life,

549
00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.860
as I think are abundantly contained within the Plejaren

550
00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.360
and Meier information, we can say,

551
00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.600
let's look at that principle as it's expressed

552
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.160
and reason through it and see if it's got

553
00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.420
an upside and a downside,

554
00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.100
if it seems to be a viable, valuable, worthwhile

555
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.880
goal to aspire to.

556
00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.620
Okay, now if we're going to aspire to it,

557
00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.340
we don't trade off advantage to get there.

558
00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.800
We may not agree on every step of getting there, too.

559
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.800
No, it's better to do it this way, it's better that...

560
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.740
But we're not seeking advantage over each other.

561
00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:34.360
We are seeking to have the helping hand to get there.

562
00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.260
Those who are in power, according to the Meier material,

563
00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.000
have the obligation not to lord it over,

564
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.240
there's a reason we use that word, lording it over,

565
00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:47.760
and lord became passed into royalty from religious,

566
00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.140
follows the steps,

567
00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:53.020
but rather to help others.

568
00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:56.300
Not to enable them in the way in which

569
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.960
we've made that word a negative,

570
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.740
but to enable them, in a positive sense,

571
00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:05.060
to find the mechanisms, the tools,

572
00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:07.520
and to find within themselves,

573
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.000
resources to use the tools to climb

574
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.160
this ladder together, if you will, and many ladders,

575
00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.660
towards attaining the goals of these principles,

576
00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:21.420
which are prosperity, peace, love, understanding,

577
00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.040
knowledge, wisdom, fellowship, abundance,

578
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.000
all the things that politics and religion promise

579
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.720
but are guaranteed to not deliver,

580
00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.220
except to a select few.

581
00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.440
<v Regina>Right.</v>

582
00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:38.440
Well, dare we even go into what this is going to yield us

583
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.060
from having done it the old way.

584
00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.800
You alluded to this earlier,

585
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.820
that a lot of what has been prophecied

586
00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:49.400
about this period in time is now going to come to pass

587
00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.080
because we didn't wake up, we didn't listen,

588
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.040
we didn't take positive action in terms of cause and effect.

589
00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.200
Dare we talk about some of what's expected

590
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:02.680
according to the Plejarens, here and elsewhere.

591
00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.980
<v ->Sure, well let's look at it a little bit generally,</v>

592
00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.240
as far back as the 50s at least,

593
00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.460
when Meier was being tutored both by Sfath and Asket.

594
00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.840
He was told, and his conversations with Asket

595
00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.320
about this were published,

596
00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:19.140
specifically about fundamentalism in its religious form,

597
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:22.600
and they also talk about the barbarity of the secular world.

598
00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.900
It's not about that only religion brings us,

599
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:29.180
but during this time, it would be the religious factions

600
00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.980
which would build the bonfire of irrational hatred,

601
00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.540
murder, and destruction to such an insane degree,

602
00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.640
that the danger that the entire world is incinerated

603
00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.560
would rest, to a large degree, on the influences overtly

604
00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.580
and covertly, of these religions and fundamentalist

605
00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.720
aspects of the religions.

606
00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:51.020
That this is before our very eyes,

607
00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.840
should be apparent to anybody.

608
00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.600
There was recently, recent to the time we're doing this now,

609
00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.640
there was a terrible event in Israel,

610
00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.660
where a degenerate, deranged,

611
00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:06.300
obviously barely human individual

612
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.920
came into an Israeli seminar

613
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:11.800
and slew a good number of children.

614
00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.800
Now the press hasn't been able to utter the word children,

615
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.000
they refer to them just as people, bad enough.

616
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.320
But these were primarily children,

617
00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.340
I think the oldest being 15, from what I recall.

618
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.720
He mowed them down and injured many others

619
00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:27.580
because he was addicted to, apart from any genuine gripes

620
00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:29.880
he may have with the Israelis,

621
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.360
and there are plenty to be had by the Palestinians,

622
00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:35.340
this religious fervor, this feeling that there was

623
00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:39.340
some god that authorizes this kind of slaughter.

624
00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:42.780
On the other hand, you have the innocent children, clearly,

625
00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.200
who were clutching their bibles when they were slain,

626
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.840
these are religious believers.

627
00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.900
Now this is the uncomfortable part for a few people.

628
00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:53.000
Children, or anybody, clutching bibles,

629
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.700
who supposedly are in close communion

630
00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.440
of the god of their choice,

631
00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.740
who some people say are the same gods

632
00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.320
of all the religions anyhow,

633
00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.680
nonetheless couldn't get the protection or the attention

634
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.060
of the god that they're probably in the process

635
00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.540
of praying to.

636
00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:07.980
So when people start to get the irrationality

637
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:09.940
of the mumbo jumbo of the religions,

638
00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:12.800
pardon me, but I don't care what you think about that,

639
00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.280
that you are repeating things and you are believing

640
00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.000
because it's in a book, therefore it's true,

641
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.440
and that's your sole authority,

642
00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.780
but the evidence of life shows

643
00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:23.000
that one irrational person can slay another

644
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.460
without any protection from a god

645
00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.200
because he can say that the god told him to do it,

646
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.020
vice versa, and we have this going on

647
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:29.580
for countless centuries.

648
00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.840
This is what is bringing us this insanity

649
00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.670
on the levels where the religions and fundamentalism

650
00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:36.990
are to be found.

651
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:40.430
The Israelis have conducted their own horrific brutality

652
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:44.230
and as warned since the time of Emmanuel,

653
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.390
and repeated in the Meier material,

654
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:49.850
because the land of Israel was taken illegitimately

655
00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:51.710
from its rightful owners,

656
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:55.090
when Emmanuel excoriated the scribes and Pharisees

657
00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:58.870
for the thievery, plundering, murder, and arson

658
00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:01.830
that enabled them to take the land from those people,

659
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:05.410
he was excoriating them that they needed to redress this,

660
00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:07.710
because otherwise, in the future times, he said

661
00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:12.070
not only would you lose gain and ultimately lose these lands

662
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:14.190
but there would come a prophet in 500 years

663
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:16.471
called Mohammed who will give your people no peace

664
00:30:16.471 --> 00:30:20.550
until the end of time, unless your own distant descendants

665
00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:22.870
who will make conciliatory and honest peace

666
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:25.230
with the descendants of the rightful owners,

667
00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:29.050
or you both will come to an inglorious end.

668
00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:30.410
We see that...

669
00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:31.670
<v Regina>In the news everyday.</v>

670
00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:32.850
<v ->In the news everyday.</v>

671
00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:36.050
So this has nothing to do with nonsense about being

672
00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:41.050
anti this religion, or antisemitic, or anti-Islamic,

673
00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:42.630
or anti-Christian.

674
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:45.930
All of these things are cultic belief systems.

675
00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:49.270
You may be a wonderful person that holds these beliefs,

676
00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:53.650
but it comes time now that either you want to search for

677
00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:57.990
and embrace truth as it supersedes any and all beliefs.

678
00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:01.410
And if truth is to be found in your religions, fine.

679
00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:03.110
And where it isn't to be found,

680
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:07.550
you must now find and embrace truth,

681
00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:11.290
and recognize that the creation, that which created,

682
00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:13.490
however you want to call it, all life,

683
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:16.610
has never had a chosen people, an only begotten son,

684
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:20.090
a solitary prophet, has never sent brother against brother,

685
00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:22.430
has never promised endless numbers of virgins

686
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.440
for slaying people, and doesn't take sides

687
00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.280
in football games either.

688
00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:30.220
This is primitive behavior, that's the age of belief.

689
00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.740
We either emerge and walk out of this together,

690
00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:38.520
or we will be picking up, those who can survive the mess,

691
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.340
will be embracing each other just for the joy of seeing

692
00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.260
a radioactive being walking around

693
00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:46.040
that looks as miserable as he or she does,

694
00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:49.140
and begging and pleading what can we do

695
00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.160
to rebuild a race of human beings

696
00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:55.240
who never again embrace irrationality as we have done it.

697
00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:59.080
Religiously, secularly, or any other way.

698
00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.400
<v Regina>What about economically?</v>

699
00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.060
<v ->Economically, but at the root of many economics,</v>

700
00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:08.060
again, you can find irrational secular

701
00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:09.820
and religious thinking.

702
00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.320
The Plejaren are said to use a system

703
00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.900
very different from ours.

704
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.240
And it's not that, maybe different societies

705
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.500
don't evolve through money and what have you,

706
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:22.420
but what they do is they do have a card kind of a system,

707
00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.860
a system of contribution to the society.

708
00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:28.680
Each person must give, certainly each adult person,

709
00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.720
must give two hours of their time to work.

710
00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.801
Give their time into the various areas

711
00:32:34.801 --> 00:32:38.420
of their societal development and benefit.

712
00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.020
Everything from the sciences to agriculture, whatever.

713
00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:42.420
It's open to them, and they can partake

714
00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:44.140
of many different means of doing this.

715
00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:45.320
<v Regina>Two hours per what?</v>

716
00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.900
<v ->Day, per day.</v>

717
00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:51.450
They are at the level where they only need that two hours.

718
00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:53.980
They claim that the average human

719
00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:57.020
needs to actually work ten hours a day, in some form.

720
00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.320
That doesn't mean hard labor, but work in many forms,

721
00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:04.120
in order to help prepare them as a physical vehicle as well,

722
00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:07.940
for being able to receive and advance

723
00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:09.900
in their spiritual development.

724
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.480
It's a whole other area,

725
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.380
but the two hour a day thing is interesting

726
00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:16.520
because as I understand it to work,

727
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:21.520
they are then allowed to have, basically whatever they need.

728
00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.820
Technology, spaceships, whatever.

729
00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:27.940
But they have a great freedom with a very rigid structure

730
00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.600
the way I sense it.

731
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.740
Yes, you can do all this and you can partake,

732
00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.500
but you must give these things,

733
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.160
there are rules for the way we behave in this society.

734
00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.180
You must contribute here.

735
00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:39.900
There are very strict rules of conduct.

736
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.800
There are things that would blow our minds

737
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.620
in terms of what they allow, I'm sure.

738
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.980
They have, for instance, super high agriculture

739
00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:50.820
where they don't even have to have

740
00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.460
anything touch the ground that is fertilized and seeded.

741
00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:55.720
They do it with robotic devices that float above,

742
00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:59.560
and they use genetic engineering abundantly, people.

743
00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.520
Because every element of science is a double-edged sword,

744
00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.880
so get off this thing that genetic engineering is bad.

745
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:07.240
Improper use of it is bad.

746
00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.560
We will eventually get off of meat, for the vegetarians,

747
00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.420
if we will only allow genetic engineering,

748
00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.360
as some if it is now breaking through,

749
00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.820
to do what Meier said the Plejaren do,

750
00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.070
we talked about this long ago, culture the meat,

751
00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:22.595
they can grow it like we make cheese or tofu.

752
00:34:22.595 --> 00:34:24.935
They grow meat, and they make it to their satisfaction

753
00:34:24.935 --> 00:34:27.335
and flavor because that protein structure,

754
00:34:27.335 --> 00:34:29.515
that whole structure contains

755
00:34:29.515 --> 00:34:31.775
enormously beneficial nutrients,

756
00:34:31.775 --> 00:34:33.515
which is why the majority of humankind

757
00:34:33.515 --> 00:34:35.315
has never been vegetarian.

758
00:34:35.315 --> 00:34:37.235
As nice as it is to be vegetarian,

759
00:34:37.235 --> 00:34:38.995
and as all the more practical as it may be

760
00:34:38.995 --> 00:34:42.095
during these times, we still benefit if we could only

761
00:34:42.095 --> 00:34:45.215
get these sources that don't require the consumption,

762
00:34:45.215 --> 00:34:48.155
inhumane, and pollution, and everything else.

763
00:34:48.155 --> 00:34:52.655
But to go back to it, they also work in their own gardens.

764
00:34:52.655 --> 00:34:53.975
They work with their hands.

765
00:34:53.975 --> 00:34:56.655
<v Regina>This is coming up very strongly</v>

766
00:34:56.655 --> 00:34:59.035
for me personally, but for many people,

767
00:34:59.035 --> 00:35:01.475
that we need to become reconnected with the land

768
00:35:01.475 --> 00:35:03.675
and take responsibility for our food sources.

769
00:35:03.675 --> 00:35:05.975
<v ->Big time, because with the greed of things</v>

770
00:35:05.975 --> 00:35:07.455
like Monsanto and the corporations

771
00:35:07.455 --> 00:35:09.355
that have also sterilized seeds...

772
00:35:09.355 --> 00:35:11.855
The suicidal mechanisms that are done

773
00:35:11.855 --> 00:35:15.555
to wring the last dollar out of the hands and banks

774
00:35:15.555 --> 00:35:19.295
of anybody, the last ounce of sense as well,

775
00:35:19.295 --> 00:35:23.495
to sterilize your seeds, to pollute as we do,

776
00:35:23.495 --> 00:35:25.995
and this polluted thinking,

777
00:35:25.995 --> 00:35:28.135
you know what, in a strange sense,

778
00:35:28.135 --> 00:35:30.895
it's part of the necessary negativity of this world

779
00:35:30.895 --> 00:35:35.895
to the point, to the degree that until we can get over

780
00:35:36.235 --> 00:35:39.995
the idea that we have to be unreasonably negative,

781
00:35:39.995 --> 00:35:43.555
selfish, greedy, and power hungry in our evolution,

782
00:35:43.555 --> 00:35:48.295
instead of embracing wisdom, generosity, abundance.

783
00:35:48.295 --> 00:35:50.235
How many people will ever use their

784
00:35:50.235 --> 00:35:52.695
24 million dollar bonuses or salaries,

785
00:35:52.695 --> 00:35:55.135
how much food will you stuff through your body?

786
00:35:55.135 --> 00:35:58.615
I know that many good people in this country

787
00:35:58.615 --> 00:36:02.695
are trying to stuff huge amounts of food into their bodies

788
00:36:02.695 --> 00:36:04.535
and they will then trod off to casinos

789
00:36:04.535 --> 00:36:07.575
and put their life savings into machines with no payout.

790
00:36:07.575 --> 00:36:09.355
I mean, we have irrational behavior

791
00:36:09.355 --> 00:36:11.855
at every level of our civilization.

792
00:36:11.855 --> 00:36:14.995
When do we wake up more en masse

793
00:36:14.995 --> 00:36:18.675
and say I think we need a course correction?

794
00:36:18.675 --> 00:36:21.395
So we start by observing our thoughts.

795
00:36:21.395 --> 00:36:23.795
What is the thing that we crave in the moment?

796
00:36:23.795 --> 00:36:25.750
Who do we hate? What do we believe in?

797
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:29.510
And then we start to process this inner consciousness

798
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:31.530
through contemplation, meditation, whatever,

799
00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:33.870
and we start to grow.

800
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:35.830
<v Regina>And this is the beginning of self-responsibility</v>

801
00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:40.270
and this is a really big one as Billy Meier's papers

802
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:42.030
from the Plejarens say.

803
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:46.714
No one is coming to save us, yet you have the Plejarens

804
00:36:46.714 --> 00:36:49.134
giving information to help us save ourselves,

805
00:36:49.134 --> 00:36:51.954
and maybe other sources that are also

806
00:36:51.954 --> 00:36:54.534
giving universal wisdoms to help us save ourselves.

807
00:36:54.534 --> 00:36:56.014
<v ->Teachings.
<v Regina>Teachings.</v>

808
00:36:56.014 --> 00:36:59.274
So we're given information to help us save ourselves.

809
00:36:59.274 --> 00:37:03.074
So this self-responsibility seems to me

810
00:37:03.074 --> 00:37:05.574
it has to go from our thoughts to our actions

811
00:37:05.574 --> 00:37:07.374
to every single thing we do in our life.

812
00:37:07.374 --> 00:37:09.154
We're responsible for the outcome.

813
00:37:09.154 --> 00:37:12.154
<v ->Absolutely, and that's why this antithetical</v>

814
00:37:12.154 --> 00:37:14.254
to a cult of any form.

815
00:37:14.254 --> 00:37:17.514
So people who have tried to defame Meier and FIGU

816
00:37:17.514 --> 00:37:20.134
and the case, and cult members, why do...

817
00:37:20.134 --> 00:37:22.834
First of all, there's no belief system.

818
00:37:22.834 --> 00:37:26.195
There are teachings, and you're free to peruse them

819
00:37:26.195 --> 00:37:27.794
and to vet them and the rest,

820
00:37:27.794 --> 00:37:31.854
and to try to find a way to embody them or not.

821
00:37:31.854 --> 00:37:36.014
And self-responsibility is not a cult.

822
00:37:36.014 --> 00:37:39.494
Self-responsibility is the essence of your freedom,

823
00:37:39.494 --> 00:37:41.654
and my freedom, and everybody's freedom.

824
00:37:41.654 --> 00:37:44.314
And that is the antithesis of what any,

825
00:37:44.314 --> 00:37:46.274
quote, unquote "powers that be" want.

826
00:37:46.274 --> 00:37:48.694
Because we are still in the primitive times

827
00:37:48.694 --> 00:37:51.854
of domination and power and greed

828
00:37:51.854 --> 00:37:54.634
where you have little Darth Vader vice presidents

829
00:37:54.634 --> 00:37:57.494
running around while their hearts are on verge of exploding,

830
00:37:57.494 --> 00:38:01.254
trying to make deals to extract yet the last drop of oil

831
00:38:01.254 --> 00:38:02.834
out of some place.

832
00:38:02.834 --> 00:38:05.654
This is a reflection, you know people have said

833
00:38:05.654 --> 00:38:07.754
that our current president at this time, President Bush

834
00:38:07.754 --> 00:38:10.794
is a stupid man or imbecile, and I say while that may

835
00:38:10.794 --> 00:38:13.114
or may not be, the really stupid people are the ones

836
00:38:13.114 --> 00:38:15.034
that have put him in power and support him,

837
00:38:15.034 --> 00:38:17.754
so that is the us of our country.

838
00:38:17.754 --> 00:38:19.374
I may not be a supporter of these things,

839
00:38:19.374 --> 00:38:22.574
but I cannot separate myself in a certain way

840
00:38:22.574 --> 00:38:24.174
from the mass here.

841
00:38:24.174 --> 00:38:26.234
If the wrecking ball comes back through this country

842
00:38:26.234 --> 00:38:29.874
and I'm living here, I'm a bowling pin here too.

843
00:38:29.874 --> 00:38:32.634
So we have to each think of ourselves that way.

844
00:38:32.634 --> 00:38:35.934
My feeling is this, and this is how I experience my life,

845
00:38:35.934 --> 00:38:39.494
there are many people, and I've met few people

846
00:38:39.494 --> 00:38:42.854
that I don't find a commonality of humanness with,

847
00:38:42.854 --> 00:38:44.554
in a person to person means.

848
00:38:44.554 --> 00:38:46.334
It doesn't mean there aren't times in which

849
00:38:46.334 --> 00:38:48.614
I either view them as part of a mass

850
00:38:48.614 --> 00:38:51.054
or have contempt for their behavior and vice versa,

851
00:38:51.054 --> 00:38:52.834
I'm sure all view that way.

852
00:38:52.834 --> 00:38:55.094
We have the opportunity now

853
00:38:55.094 --> 00:38:57.374
to take responsibility individually.

854
00:38:57.374 --> 00:38:59.954
We'll become far less quote, unquote "judgmental,"

855
00:38:59.954 --> 00:39:01.574
certainly falsely of each other

856
00:39:01.574 --> 00:39:04.354
when we get this is the first job,

857
00:39:04.354 --> 00:39:05.874
and we can feel that everybody else

858
00:39:05.874 --> 00:39:07.694
is trying to take that responsibility.

859
00:39:07.694 --> 00:39:09.774
<v Regina>Yes, absolutely.</v>

860
00:39:09.774 --> 00:39:11.584
Final question.

861
00:39:12.554 --> 00:39:15.574
Purpose. What do the Plejarens say

862
00:39:15.574 --> 00:39:18.054
is the purpose of each of these incarnations

863
00:39:18.054 --> 00:39:19.994
of our lives as individuals?

864
00:39:19.994 --> 00:39:22.234
<v ->I think Billy even said in the film,</v>

865
00:39:22.234 --> 00:39:26.394
the purpose of life is the evolution of consciousness.

866
00:39:26.394 --> 00:39:29.334
And that's from the microcosm to the macrocosm.

867
00:39:29.334 --> 00:39:32.654
This creation, this universe too, has evolution.

868
00:39:32.654 --> 00:39:36.134
It's not perfect, and is always perfecting itself.

869
00:39:36.134 --> 00:39:39.834
As far as for us, it's the evolution of consciousness,

870
00:39:39.834 --> 00:39:43.074
to be conscious, to work with consciousness,

871
00:39:43.074 --> 00:39:45.594
and all that that means now

872
00:39:45.594 --> 00:39:46.754
and will mean to us in the future

873
00:39:46.754 --> 00:39:49.954
as we develop other senses that they claim

874
00:39:49.954 --> 00:39:52.234
the humans are heir to, and we can become

875
00:39:52.234 --> 00:39:54.174
a little more fully human.

876
00:39:54.174 --> 00:39:56.054
When we can civilize ourselves

877
00:39:56.054 --> 00:39:58.274
and not maintain the aggressive beasts

878
00:39:58.274 --> 00:40:01.134
that we are too easily prone to becoming,

879
00:40:01.134 --> 00:40:03.054
and the place from which we enact.

880
00:40:03.054 --> 00:40:05.074
So the evolution of consciousness,

881
00:40:05.074 --> 00:40:06.534
that's an exciting idea.

882
00:40:06.534 --> 00:40:09.534
It means that in time, practically nothing

883
00:40:09.534 --> 00:40:12.854
is withheld from us because we can use this

884
00:40:12.854 --> 00:40:14.474
phenomenal thing within.

885
00:40:14.474 --> 00:40:17.554
I warn people against, there was a film called

886
00:40:17.554 --> 00:40:20.254
Invasion of the Body Snatchers, the pod people,

887
00:40:20.254 --> 00:40:22.014
The Invasion of the Pod People.

888
00:40:22.014 --> 00:40:25.134
Today we have a new generation of pod people.

889
00:40:25.134 --> 00:40:26.654
They're the iPod people.

890
00:40:26.654 --> 00:40:27.894
Generically what I mean is

891
00:40:27.894 --> 00:40:29.934
people who choose one form or another,

892
00:40:29.934 --> 00:40:33.554
whether it's solely through having

893
00:40:33.554 --> 00:40:35.714
the beads in their head that they're inputting

894
00:40:35.714 --> 00:40:38.074
whatever noise and nonsense and who knows what else

895
00:40:38.074 --> 00:40:39.794
into their head, and there are some beautiful things too,

896
00:40:39.794 --> 00:40:42.354
but compulsively, constantly in that mode,

897
00:40:42.354 --> 00:40:44.654
or constantly on the cell phone and texting,

898
00:40:44.654 --> 00:40:46.594
or playing video games or anything else,

899
00:40:46.594 --> 00:40:48.454
all of which, if done homeopathically,

900
00:40:48.454 --> 00:40:51.034
are probably just part of our technological evolution,

901
00:40:51.034 --> 00:40:53.754
but those people that give themselves over to that

902
00:40:53.754 --> 00:40:56.634
are the ones that are becoming disconnected

903
00:40:56.634 --> 00:40:59.374
and easily manipulated so that the coming attempts

904
00:40:59.374 --> 00:41:03.514
to biochip each and every one of you,

905
00:41:03.514 --> 00:41:06.214
each and every one of you to be controllled

906
00:41:06.214 --> 00:41:07.954
through the already existing satellite

907
00:41:07.954 --> 00:41:10.294
and computer systems set up for this purpose,

908
00:41:10.294 --> 00:41:11.874
that you'll be far more willing

909
00:41:11.874 --> 00:41:13.634
to march your little butts forward

910
00:41:13.634 --> 00:41:16.034
and get your chips pumped into your body

911
00:41:16.034 --> 00:41:17.114
for that purpose.

912
00:41:17.114 --> 00:41:19.414
So if you are a self-responsible person

913
00:41:19.414 --> 00:41:21.914
who is not turning over all of your available time

914
00:41:21.914 --> 00:41:24.374
to these electronic distractions,

915
00:41:24.374 --> 00:41:26.895
to the latest sports events, or whatever else,

916
00:41:26.895 --> 00:41:30.534
but are taking more time, as the Plejaren say,

917
00:41:30.534 --> 00:41:33.654
observe nature to understand the laws of creation,

918
00:41:33.654 --> 00:41:37.974
and begin to see the creation in everyone and everything,

919
00:41:37.974 --> 00:41:40.994
and that is part of the evolution of consciousness.

920
00:41:40.994 --> 00:41:45.234
This isn't my thinking alone, I resonate with it

921
00:41:45.234 --> 00:41:47.294
because the little bit that I've been able

922
00:41:47.294 --> 00:41:49.434
to start doing consciously in the time

923
00:41:49.434 --> 00:41:51.514
that I've been exposed to this Meier material,

924
00:41:51.514 --> 00:41:53.434
is the reward in itself.

925
00:41:53.434 --> 00:41:55.494
And to be able to just be a person

926
00:41:55.494 --> 00:41:57.954
saying to other people, wake up,

927
00:41:57.954 --> 00:41:59.454
however you want to do it,

928
00:41:59.454 --> 00:42:02.934
this is one available source where if you really want

929
00:42:02.934 --> 00:42:05.334
what we talk about in this country, freedom,

930
00:42:05.334 --> 00:42:08.374
stop giving it up to all these outside sources,

931
00:42:08.374 --> 00:42:13.074
and take back control and power over your own life.

932
00:42:13.074 --> 00:42:16.084
