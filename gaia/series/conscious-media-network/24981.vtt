1
00:00:00.718 --> 00:00:02.487
<v ->Stephen Bassett is mad as hell,</v>

2
00:00:02.487 --> 00:00:04.865
and he's not taking it anymore.

3
00:00:04.865 --> 00:00:07.898
He says the game of hiding the presence of extraterrestrial

4
00:00:07.898 --> 00:00:10.214
presence here on Earth has to end,

5
00:00:10.214 --> 00:00:12.714
that it's time for full disclosure.

6
00:00:12.714 --> 00:00:15.034
I met Stephen at perhaps one of the most profound events

7
00:00:15.034 --> 00:00:18.934
of my life, in Washington D.C. at the National Press Club

8
00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:21.574
where approximately two dozen former military and

9
00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:25.755
civilian officers disclosed their personal experiences

10
00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:28.075
relating to visitations by what we call

11
00:00:28.075 --> 00:00:29.895
extraterrestrial beings.

12
00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:32.510
Stephen, along with millions of us, want to know

13
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.620
what the agenda is.

14
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.230
<v Regina>Stephen, last time I saw you was at one of the</v>

15
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.450
most extraordinary events I have ever witnessed

16
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.870
in my entire life, which was in May of 2001

17
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.530
at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.

18
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.639
at the Disclosure Event, and my guess is that only

19
00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:56.792
a fraction of a percentage of the people watching

20
00:00:56.792 --> 00:01:00.012
this interview now have even heard of this event.

21
00:01:00.012 --> 00:01:02.112
<v ->Sadly I think you're right.</v>

22
00:01:02.112 --> 00:01:05.832
The Disclosure Project Press Conference May 9, 2001

23
00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:09.232
National Press Club was potentially a major

24
00:01:09.232 --> 00:01:11.432
event in history.

25
00:01:11.432 --> 00:01:13.132
I was there, as you were.

26
00:01:13.132 --> 00:01:16.192
I helped to set it up with the Press Club, and so forth.

27
00:01:16.192 --> 00:01:18.973
In other words, I assisted Steven Greer's Disclosure Project

28
00:01:18.973 --> 00:01:20.993
to the extent that I could.

29
00:01:23.623 --> 00:01:28.424
And to quickly recap, they presented to an audience of 200,

30
00:01:28.424 --> 00:01:31.244
which included 100 press and 17 camera crews.

31
00:01:31.244 --> 00:01:33.104
<v Regina>And press from all over the world, by the way.</v>

32
00:01:33.104 --> 00:01:34.484
<v ->International and national, yeah.</v>

33
00:01:34.484 --> 00:01:36.044
It was the largest press club conference held

34
00:01:36.044 --> 00:01:37.424
at the Press Club in memory.

35
00:01:37.424 --> 00:01:39.244
No one could recall one larger.

36
00:01:39.244 --> 00:01:43.164
They presented the distillation of his witness work,

37
00:01:43.164 --> 00:01:46.145
about 120 hours of testimony,

38
00:01:46.145 --> 00:01:49.685
or was it 220 hours of testimony from about

39
00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:51.965
a hundred and some witnesses was distilled to a

40
00:01:51.965 --> 00:01:56.965
four-hour greatest hits tape, and I think 75 witnesses.

41
00:01:57.165 --> 00:01:58.586
And they presented that along with about

42
00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:00.977
21 witnesses onsite.

43
00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:05.227
Ran through their very brief capsule of their personal

44
00:02:05.227 --> 00:02:07.627
experience and who they were.

45
00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:11.447
And the intent was simple, to try to create a credibility

46
00:02:13.447 --> 00:02:16.386
jump to take it to another level so the press could be

47
00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:19.346
freed up from this trance that they've been in.

48
00:02:19.346 --> 00:02:22.286
They've bought into a government propaganda move,

49
00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:23.566
which has happened before.

50
00:02:23.566 --> 00:02:25.246
I mean, there's nothing unusual about that.

51
00:02:25.246 --> 00:02:26.946
The press have been fooled before.

52
00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:28.486
<v Regina>I used to be a member of the press--</v>

53
00:02:28.486 --> 00:02:29.408
<v ->Yeah, they're fooled.
as a matter of fact,

54
00:02:29.408 --> 00:02:31.248
and as a news anchor I was not allowed to mention

55
00:02:31.248 --> 00:02:32.088
this issue ever.

56
00:02:32.088 --> 00:02:33.068
<v ->And not in America.</v>

57
00:02:33.068 --> 00:02:35.348
I think German press got kinda fooled in 1930's,

58
00:02:35.348 --> 00:02:38.568
and the British press were fooled over colonization,

59
00:02:38.568 --> 00:02:39.548
a lot of other things.

60
00:02:39.548 --> 00:02:41.448
I mean, the press get fooled, and they bought into it,

61
00:02:41.448 --> 00:02:44.849
and this attempts to move above that.

62
00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.249
And of course it was held in Washington,

63
00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.769
so you're talking about the political press.

64
00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.269
So the event was important.

65
00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.329
The testimony was powerful.

66
00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.329
In fact, just as an aside, a tape of the four-hour

67
00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.630
condensed tape was delivered through a contact of mine

68
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.809
directly to Ted Koppel at Nightline, who I and others

69
00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:06.909
had been approaching on this issue for nearly 10 years,

70
00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.509
but would not do it.
<v Regina>Touch it.</v>

71
00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.581
To his unfortunate, I think he will regret that.

72
00:03:14.581 --> 00:03:19.581
In any event, somebody from ABC got back to me, ABC News,

73
00:03:20.581 --> 00:03:23.621
that night and said, OK, we will start vetting six of your

74
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:27.761
best witnesses for further perhaps interviews and so forth.

75
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:30.281
Wonderful, and I assumed that similar things were happening

76
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:33.981
at other networks, and perhaps CNN and so forth.

77
00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:37.742
And the stage was set.

78
00:03:37.742 --> 00:03:39.882
If these witnesses started getting significant prime time

79
00:03:39.882 --> 00:03:44.202
interview face time on these shows, some of them are so good

80
00:03:44.202 --> 00:03:46.662
that I just can't believe the press wouldn't have

81
00:03:46.662 --> 00:03:48.322
broken rank.

82
00:03:48.322 --> 00:03:50.202
And then just four months later

83
00:03:50.202 --> 00:03:54.022
the alleged Saudi Arabian flying circus came to town.

84
00:03:54.022 --> 00:03:56.162
<v Regina>Right, nine eleven, and the entire issue died.</v>

85
00:03:56.162 --> 00:03:57.762
<v ->Along with a thousand other issues.</v>

86
00:03:57.762 --> 00:04:00.082
<v Regina>Many other issues, but that issue died.</v>

87
00:04:00.082 --> 00:04:03.902
<v ->Yeah, and the follow up ended, and as a result</v>

88
00:04:03.902 --> 00:04:06.113
though there was coverage, there was a substantial

89
00:04:06.113 --> 00:04:08.913
internet presence there.

90
00:04:08.913 --> 00:04:11.253
It was broadcast live, and hits were pouring in by the

91
00:04:11.253 --> 00:04:12.593
hundreds of thousands.

92
00:04:12.593 --> 00:04:16.413
Its a big world, and so five years later I'm sure that

93
00:04:16.413 --> 00:04:20.453
maybe one in 500 people, maybe even one in a thousand

94
00:04:20.453 --> 00:04:22.453
you could meet on the street would know what you're

95
00:04:22.453 --> 00:04:25.093
talking about when you talk about May 9th, 2001.

96
00:04:25.093 --> 00:04:26.013
<v Regina>If that.</v>

97
00:04:26.013 --> 00:04:28.244
<v ->Your viewers should go to the</v>

98
00:04:28.244 --> 00:04:30.904
disclosureproject.org website.

99
00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:34.144
They have the media coverage, and the media coverage

100
00:04:34.144 --> 00:04:35.964
was not too bad.

101
00:04:35.964 --> 00:04:40.144
There was, in fact, a lot, and there were

102
00:04:40.144 --> 00:04:41.344
a number of news articles.

103
00:04:41.344 --> 00:04:43.336
It was covered on a number of stations.

104
00:04:45.126 --> 00:04:47.346
The Washington Post in particular--

105
00:04:47.346 --> 00:04:48.506
<v Regina>I remember the Post.</v>

106
00:04:48.506 --> 00:04:51.406
definitely did a, no the Times did a good piece,

107
00:04:51.406 --> 00:04:53.426
but the Washington Post,--

108
00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:55.066
<v Regina>Oh, that was that slam piece.</v>

109
00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:56.466
to their utter disgrace--
<v Regina>Yeah, yeah, right.</v>

110
00:04:56.466 --> 00:04:59.306
utter disgrace because I know the situation at the Post,

111
00:04:59.306 --> 00:05:01.026
and I've been following it for a very long time.

112
00:05:01.026 --> 00:05:06.026
A great paper which will have much, much, much to answer.

113
00:05:06.866 --> 00:05:09.406
The extent of their coverage was a humor piece

114
00:05:09.406 --> 00:05:12.606
by Joe Rokenbok, who eventually went on to become

115
00:05:12.606 --> 00:05:16.026
the backup humor columnist for the Washington Magazine

116
00:05:16.026 --> 00:05:18.546
in the newspaper after Dave Barry left.

117
00:05:18.546 --> 00:05:20.726
He did a humor piece on it because he has been the

118
00:05:20.726 --> 00:05:24.246
designated humor guy on the subject for a long time.

119
00:05:24.246 --> 00:05:27.686
He's a smart guy, he has wife, he has kids,

120
00:05:29.036 --> 00:05:32.437
and he ended up either wittingly or unwittingly being put in

121
00:05:32.437 --> 00:05:36.097
the role of being the, along with Howard Kurtz,

122
00:05:36.097 --> 00:05:41.097
the buffer debunkers, to avoid having to deal with real

123
00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:43.436
journalism on this issue.

124
00:05:43.436 --> 00:05:46.036
I hope it was unwitting because if it wasn't, he's got a lot

125
00:05:46.036 --> 00:05:48.856
to answer for, and he's gonna live a long time.

126
00:05:48.856 --> 00:05:52.616
The Post has committed absolute journalistic heresy

127
00:05:52.616 --> 00:05:55.836
on this issue for as long as we can go back to the

128
00:05:55.836 --> 00:05:57.196
beginning of the Post.

129
00:05:57.196 --> 00:05:59.456
I believe the compromise occurs at the publishing level

130
00:05:59.456 --> 00:06:03.576
involving the Grahams and includes the current publisher.

131
00:06:03.576 --> 00:06:08.496
It is the political paper in America, and for as long as

132
00:06:08.496 --> 00:06:11.636
the Washington Post has existed it has deliberately

133
00:06:11.636 --> 00:06:15.096
and intentionally stood down on the work and the research

134
00:06:15.096 --> 00:06:17.236
regarding the extraterrestrial presence,

135
00:06:17.236 --> 00:06:19.036
and has deceived the public.

136
00:06:19.036 --> 00:06:21.216
This is intentional at the high level, not necessarily

137
00:06:21.216 --> 00:06:24.316
at the level of the reporting, the direct reporting.

138
00:06:24.316 --> 00:06:27.996
And I believe that everybody associated with this act

139
00:06:27.996 --> 00:06:31.196
on the part of the Post needs to answer for it either

140
00:06:31.196 --> 00:06:34.636
through their memoirs or through interviews at some point

141
00:06:34.636 --> 00:06:36.476
so that it never happens again.

142
00:06:36.476 --> 00:06:39.176
And I'm happy to debate any member of the Washington Post

143
00:06:39.176 --> 00:06:41.896
editorial board or the publishing board or their

144
00:06:41.896 --> 00:06:45.956
science teams or anything else, debate their role in this,

145
00:06:45.956 --> 00:06:47.996
what they have said and done about this,

146
00:06:47.996 --> 00:06:49.896
and what they allegedly know about this.

147
00:06:49.896 --> 00:06:52.296
Let me also point out that for four years running

148
00:06:52.296 --> 00:06:56.156
I contacted the publishers of the Washington Post

149
00:06:56.156 --> 00:06:59.456
in a very I think reasonable and straightforward way,

150
00:06:59.456 --> 00:07:02.416
offered to arrange meetings with some of the top people

151
00:07:02.416 --> 00:07:06.416
in this field, including astronauts and other witnesses,

152
00:07:06.416 --> 00:07:10.216
to meet privately with the top editors.

153
00:07:10.216 --> 00:07:12.496
The meeting would not be divulged.

154
00:07:12.496 --> 00:07:15.276
It would be off the record so that they could then make

155
00:07:15.276 --> 00:07:18.776
an informed decision about, wow, if these people with this

156
00:07:18.776 --> 00:07:21.116
level of credibility and experience are saying this,

157
00:07:21.116 --> 00:07:23.636
maybe we should do some journalism here.

158
00:07:23.636 --> 00:07:25.636
So the risk would be minimal,

159
00:07:25.636 --> 00:07:28.556
and absolutely was turned down.

160
00:07:28.556 --> 00:07:30.156
Not only was not turned down, there was only one time

161
00:07:30.156 --> 00:07:32.596
that they even responded.

162
00:07:32.596 --> 00:07:37.596
And so let it be known the Post has had dozens and dozens

163
00:07:37.696 --> 00:07:41.396
of opportunities to engage this issue, and has intentionally

164
00:07:41.396 --> 00:07:45.716
and deliberately, and in my opinion unethically,

165
00:07:45.716 --> 00:07:48.929
chosen not to engage this issue because in my opinion

166
00:07:48.929 --> 00:07:52.911
it is in cooperation with the United States government's

167
00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:55.691
military and intelligence complex on this issue,

168
00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:59.571
which raises the question what other major issues

169
00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:04.401
of the day and past days did the Post elect to be in

170
00:08:05.141 --> 00:08:06.639
cooperation with?
<v Regina>To suppress, yes.</v>

171
00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:08.679
And we're talking about, when you were mentioning

172
00:08:08.679 --> 00:08:10.539
astronauts two that come to mind immediately are

173
00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:12.139
Gordon Cooper and Edgar Mitchell.

174
00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:13.329
<v ->For openers.</v>

175
00:08:13.329 --> 00:08:17.260
<v Regina>They've both been very open about their express</v>

176
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.920
understanding that extraterrestrial presence exists, period.

177
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.860
<v ->Oh I mean, let's just cut to the chase.</v>

178
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.400
A gentleman with a PhD in astrophysics from MIT,

179
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.800
who became an astronaut, but not any astronaut because

180
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.800
only the creme de la creme got the moon walk, alright.

181
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.460
It wasn't a lottery.

182
00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.770
Every astronaut would have sold their soul to the devil

183
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.990
to get that, and only the very best got to walk on the moon,

184
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.090
and Edgar Mitchell walked on the moon.

185
00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.230
And for the last seven years, now going back to '97,

186
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:55.228
last nine years he has repeated over and over again,

187
00:08:55.228 --> 00:08:58.588
based on high level sources, there is an extraterrestrial

188
00:08:58.588 --> 00:09:00.188
presence engaging this planet,

189
00:09:00.188 --> 00:09:02.888
and the Roswell events were true, alright?

190
00:09:02.888 --> 00:09:04.508
And that there is a cover up.

191
00:09:04.508 --> 00:09:05.968
Have you seen him on Nightline?

192
00:09:05.968 --> 00:09:07.508
Have you seen him with Dan Rather?

193
00:09:07.508 --> 00:09:10.368
Have you seen him on any major news program

194
00:09:10.368 --> 00:09:11.388
being interviewed?

195
00:09:11.388 --> 00:09:12.208
No.

196
00:09:12.208 --> 00:09:14.482
They are basically saying

197
00:09:14.482 --> 00:09:16.102
read the tabloids.

198
00:09:16.102 --> 00:09:17.562
That's where the truth is.

199
00:09:17.562 --> 00:09:20.082
Edgar Mitchell is not someone to be trusted.

200
00:09:20.082 --> 00:09:22.842
And I say Edgar Mitchell has more integrity than

201
00:09:22.842 --> 00:09:27.122
the entire political core in Washington, D.C.

202
00:09:27.122 --> 00:09:29.082
covering the press, alright?

203
00:09:29.082 --> 00:09:32.222
And they owe him a big apology.

204
00:09:32.222 --> 00:09:34.582
Gordon Cooper, he's a legend.

205
00:09:34.582 --> 00:09:36.442
<v Regina>Right.</v>
<v ->Right, he's a legend.</v>

206
00:09:36.442 --> 00:09:38.402
Goes back a little further.

207
00:09:38.402 --> 00:09:41.422
He came public on what he had seen and heard

208
00:09:41.422 --> 00:09:44.622
during an event that took place, an actual landing event.

209
00:09:44.622 --> 00:09:47.142
He also came forward with his view that UFOs were real,

210
00:09:47.142 --> 00:09:48.342
and so forth.

211
00:09:48.342 --> 00:09:51.042
Let me assure you, both men paid heavily for this.

212
00:09:51.042 --> 00:09:53.162
And while their publicists, I've actually talked to

213
00:09:53.162 --> 00:09:55.602
the publicist of Gordon Cooper, won't say that,

214
00:09:55.602 --> 00:09:57.462
they won't say, "Oh no no no, they haven't paid"

215
00:09:57.462 --> 00:10:01.502
because that doesn't serve what opportunities are there.

216
00:10:01.502 --> 00:10:06.502
Let me assure you that the awards, the opportunities,

217
00:10:07.342 --> 00:10:12.322
the business opportunities and perhaps money to live on,

218
00:10:12.322 --> 00:10:15.103
books and everything else, additional opportunities

219
00:10:15.103 --> 00:10:18.063
for these things that were lost to these gentlemen

220
00:10:18.063 --> 00:10:21.583
because they defied the military intelligence complex,

221
00:10:21.583 --> 00:10:24.003
the secret empire on this issue,

222
00:10:24.003 --> 00:10:26.423
and particularly defied them given their high standing,

223
00:10:26.423 --> 00:10:28.333
is incalculable, right?

224
00:10:28.333 --> 00:10:29.986
I don't believe that Mitchell has gotten

225
00:10:29.986 --> 00:10:31.046
the Medal of Freedom.

226
00:10:31.046 --> 00:10:33.566
If I am mistaken, I hope to be corrected on that,

227
00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:35.026
and I will research it.

228
00:10:35.026 --> 00:10:38.226
I'm not even sure Gordon Cooper got the Medal of Freedom.

229
00:10:38.226 --> 00:10:40.826
Given who they've been giving the Medal of Freedom

230
00:10:40.826 --> 00:10:45.026
to lately, if that's true, it's a disgrace that I don't even

231
00:10:45.026 --> 00:10:46.886
wanna get into 'cause I'll get angry.

232
00:10:46.886 --> 00:10:48.626
<v Regina>Well, I can tell, and I know you're angry,</v>

233
00:10:48.626 --> 00:10:50.306
and a lot of people are angry on this issue,--

234
00:10:50.306 --> 00:10:51.166
<v ->They should be.</v>

235
00:10:51.166 --> 00:10:52.827
and it goes even further than that, and I would like to

236
00:10:52.827 --> 00:10:55.367
get into just a couple of the what I thought were really

237
00:10:55.367 --> 00:10:56.927
some of the incredible testimony.

238
00:10:56.927 --> 00:10:59.547
Just a little bit to give people watching just a taste

239
00:10:59.547 --> 00:11:01.447
of what was going on, and one of them that really

240
00:11:01.447 --> 00:11:05.387
captured me was Captain Robert Salas and what happened

241
00:11:05.387 --> 00:11:07.788
with the nuclear silos.

242
00:11:08.429 --> 00:11:10.129
<v ->Now here's first hand.</v>

243
00:11:10.129 --> 00:11:11.989
Gordon Cooper, for instance, had a little first hand,

244
00:11:11.989 --> 00:11:13.789
and he had some sources.

245
00:11:13.789 --> 00:11:16.289
Edgar Mitchell was primarily from high level sources,

246
00:11:16.289 --> 00:11:18.469
but he's certainly a man to have such sources.

247
00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:23.249
But here's Salas who's just a classic example of a

248
00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:25.729
patriotic American who served in the military,

249
00:11:25.729 --> 00:11:28.709
served well, has gone on to do well in his life.

250
00:11:28.709 --> 00:11:31.729
Does not have a vested interest in quote,

251
00:11:31.729 --> 00:11:34.149
the UFO research arena, and everything else that's gone.

252
00:11:34.149 --> 00:11:36.489
In fact, I think he probably preferred not to be dealing

253
00:11:36.489 --> 00:11:38.089
with it at all.

254
00:11:38.089 --> 00:11:39.249
It's very simple.

255
00:11:39.249 --> 00:11:44.249
He was, I think he was lead officer down in the silo

256
00:11:44.469 --> 00:11:47.729
when a craft came down and hovered directly over the gate.

257
00:11:47.729 --> 00:11:49.569
<v Regina>And it scared the men who were guarding the gate.</v>

258
00:11:49.569 --> 00:11:52.009
<v ->Well, it scared them so much, the only injury occurred</v>

259
00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:54.289
when one guard tried to climb back over the fence

260
00:11:54.289 --> 00:11:55.789
into the compound, not that it would have made

261
00:11:55.789 --> 00:11:56.829
much difference.
<v Regina>Because the UFO was</v>

262
00:11:56.829 --> 00:11:58.369
hovering over the facility.
<v ->He cut himself on the wire.</v>

263
00:11:58.369 --> 00:12:00.829
And so the calls went down into the silo, and he got those.

264
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:03.229
He never actually came up out of there, he couldn't.

265
00:12:03.229 --> 00:12:04.990
This is happening, this is happening, what are we gonna do?

266
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.430
And he's basically saying something to the effect of

267
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.710
do this, do that.

268
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.650
He's limited in what he could do.

269
00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:14.590
So but all hell's breaking loose up there at a SAC base.

270
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.113
And then the missiles started shutting down

271
00:12:17.113 --> 00:12:20.015
one after another, boink, boink, boink, boink.

272
00:12:21.323 --> 00:12:23.145
This doesn't happen very often.

273
00:12:23.145 --> 00:12:26.565
More interestingly, missiles were also being shut down

274
00:12:26.565 --> 00:12:30.364
at other bases up the line, alright?

275
00:12:30.364 --> 00:12:33.104
Now what happens after that?

276
00:12:33.104 --> 00:12:34.504
Eventually he emerges.

277
00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:37.284
He gets the direct testimony from people there.

278
00:12:37.284 --> 00:12:40.364
He has since contacted those people, they're still alive.

279
00:12:40.364 --> 00:12:43.124
If one of our fine news establishments would like to

280
00:12:43.124 --> 00:12:46.144
look into one of the most interesting cases in history

281
00:12:46.144 --> 00:12:48.504
involving a SAC base, these people could be assembled

282
00:12:48.504 --> 00:12:49.584
and interviewed.

283
00:12:49.584 --> 00:12:51.224
If they could take a little time off covering the

284
00:12:51.224 --> 00:12:55.204
Petersen trial or Natalie Holloway's disappearance in Aruba.

285
00:12:55.204 --> 00:12:58.324
You know, the news is now CNN, crime news network,

286
00:12:58.324 --> 00:13:00.724
FNN, fa news network,

287
00:13:00.724 --> 00:13:03.754
and MSNBC, the missing news network.

288
00:13:04.504 --> 00:13:08.384
Ted Turner has virtually said, he actually apologized

289
00:13:08.384 --> 00:13:10.624
to the American people for what's happened to CNN,

290
00:13:10.624 --> 00:13:13.044
that he let it get away from him and turned into

291
00:13:13.044 --> 00:13:14.724
the show that it's become.

292
00:13:14.724 --> 00:13:15.709
Not that there aren't a couple of

293
00:13:15.709 --> 00:13:17.605
good people on these shows.

294
00:13:17.605 --> 00:13:20.029
<v Regina>But just let me interject one thing.</v>

295
00:13:20.029 --> 00:13:25.029
Before Colonel Salas went about his own research

296
00:13:25.111 --> 00:13:27.951
he was visited by special investigations,

297
00:13:27.951 --> 00:13:29.831
and as most of the witnesses were--

298
00:13:29.831 --> 00:13:31.091
<v ->Oh yeah, sure.
they had to sign,

299
00:13:31.091 --> 00:13:32.651
they were under a national security oath,

300
00:13:32.651 --> 00:13:34.671
and they had to sign they would never speak of these events

301
00:13:34.671 --> 00:13:37.971
under threat of, well court martial, imprisonment, whatever.

302
00:13:37.971 --> 00:13:39.411
<v ->And he didn't speak for a long time.</v>

303
00:13:39.411 --> 00:13:41.531
<v Regina>And this was a big risk for any of them to speak.</v>

304
00:13:41.531 --> 00:13:42.951
<v ->Less risk when he finally came out.</v>

305
00:13:42.951 --> 00:13:46.272
I mean, the context of which Bob Salas came out

306
00:13:46.272 --> 00:13:48.792
is way different because the whole thing has changed.

307
00:13:48.792 --> 00:13:51.092
We're heading toward disclosure very soon,

308
00:13:51.092 --> 00:13:54.812
and as we get close to it what the people inside are willing

309
00:13:54.812 --> 00:13:57.052
and not willing to do has dramatically changed.

310
00:13:57.052 --> 00:13:59.932
But let me tell you, if he had made a move to approach

311
00:13:59.932 --> 00:14:04.252
the press on what he knows back in the early '80's,

312
00:14:04.252 --> 00:14:07.032
he might have ended up with a bad fate.

313
00:14:07.032 --> 00:14:07.952
But nevertheless--

314
00:14:07.952 --> 00:14:09.652
<v Regina>And going back to that event, the silos,</v>

315
00:14:09.652 --> 00:14:11.292
boom boom boom, one shut down at a time.

316
00:14:11.292 --> 00:14:14.072
And then after what, 30, 40 seconds they came back.

317
00:14:14.072 --> 00:14:15.032
It was a short time--

318
00:14:15.032 --> 00:14:16.152
<v ->They were to bring them back up.</v>

319
00:14:16.152 --> 00:14:17.332
a minute or two they came right back up.

320
00:14:17.332 --> 00:14:18.172
<v ->And it happened again.</v>

321
00:14:18.172 --> 00:14:21.992
I mean, it happened in the '80s, but the Salas event

322
00:14:21.992 --> 00:14:26.992
was most prominent because he is one of the few that decided

323
00:14:27.316 --> 00:14:30.436
I'm gonna talk about this, and made the effort to go and

324
00:14:30.436 --> 00:14:32.357
reconnect some of the people that were there,

325
00:14:32.357 --> 00:14:35.717
that actually saw it onsite, confirming once again that

326
00:14:35.717 --> 00:14:37.858
this wasn't just sort of a, you know, maybe they brought

327
00:14:37.858 --> 00:14:40.398
a couple cases of beer out to the SAC base, you know,

328
00:14:40.398 --> 00:14:42.258
and got a little high, no no.

329
00:14:42.258 --> 00:14:46.238
But the fact is if the news were to start investigating

330
00:14:46.238 --> 00:14:48.438
the Salas case, you know what would happen?

331
00:14:48.438 --> 00:14:51.378
They would start learning about other events at SAC bases,

332
00:14:51.378 --> 00:14:53.618
and other people like him would come forward if they felt

333
00:14:53.618 --> 00:14:55.178
they had proper cover, and the next thing you know

334
00:14:55.178 --> 00:14:58.618
they might have dozens of people working SAC bases

335
00:14:58.618 --> 00:15:01.578
in the '70s and '80s where our missiles were interfered with

336
00:15:01.578 --> 00:15:03.578
by these craft.

337
00:15:03.578 --> 00:15:05.338
You think that's news?

338
00:15:05.338 --> 00:15:06.458
Is that news?

339
00:15:06.458 --> 00:15:10.118
Will somebody tell me who works for American news

340
00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:12.288
media today what is news?

341
00:15:12.288 --> 00:15:13.938
(Regina laughs)

342
00:15:13.938 --> 00:15:16.758
What does it constitute to be news?

343
00:15:16.758 --> 00:15:19.390
Because I'm starting to not understand it anymore.

344
00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:20.650
It's not clear to me.

345
00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:24.861
I mean, clearly war is news, and any beautiful person gets

346
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:27.271
kidnapped is news.
<v Regina>Paris Hilton is.</v>

347
00:15:27.271 --> 00:15:29.451
And celebrity that commits a crime is news,

348
00:15:29.451 --> 00:15:32.071
but outside of that it's not clear to me what news is.

349
00:15:32.071 --> 00:15:35.323
I would like to brought up to speed.

350
00:15:36.011 --> 00:15:38.033
<v Regina>Well, I think you're sharing that viewpoint</v>

351
00:15:38.033 --> 00:15:39.433
with most everybody watching this,

352
00:15:39.433 --> 00:15:40.613
including myself.
<v ->I hope so.</v>

353
00:15:40.613 --> 00:15:41.515
I hope, I hope.

354
00:15:41.515 --> 00:15:42.735
<v Regina>Meanwhile going back to, I mean this has</v>

355
00:15:42.735 --> 00:15:43.755
a lot of implications.

356
00:15:43.755 --> 00:15:45.455
I'm just gonna stick with that one event for another

357
00:15:45.455 --> 00:15:48.575
second or two because, OK, the craft was there,

358
00:15:48.575 --> 00:15:50.835
the silo shut down, it was very peaceful,

359
00:15:50.835 --> 00:15:52.175
they came right back up again.

360
00:15:52.175 --> 00:15:55.325
Clearly this was simply, it would appear, if one's trying to

361
00:15:55.325 --> 00:15:57.305
second guess what might have happened,

362
00:15:57.305 --> 00:16:01.056
there was some sort of show that this is really,

363
00:16:01.056 --> 00:16:03.176
we're not the only ones that may have control

364
00:16:03.176 --> 00:16:06.176
over this kind of behavior in terms of shooting off

365
00:16:06.176 --> 00:16:07.456
nuclear weapons on the planet.

366
00:16:07.456 --> 00:16:08.399
Who knows what the deal was.

367
00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:09.559
<v ->We're guessing.
<v Regina>We're guessing.</v>

368
00:16:09.559 --> 00:16:10.521
<v ->Yeah, we're guessing.
<v Regina>They shut it down,</v>

369
00:16:10.521 --> 00:16:12.701
they let it back up, they left, there was nobody hurt.

370
00:16:12.701 --> 00:16:16.601
<v ->Was it a, look, your silly nuclear weapons which</v>

371
00:16:16.601 --> 00:16:17.843
you're gonna destroy yourself with,

372
00:16:17.843 --> 00:16:18.763
they're nothing.

373
00:16:18.763 --> 00:16:20.443
Here's what we can do with it.
<v Regina>Exactly.</v>

374
00:16:20.443 --> 00:16:22.083
<v ->Or don't mess with us.</v>

375
00:16:22.083 --> 00:16:24.103
We will do with you as we please.

376
00:16:24.103 --> 00:16:25.883
We can shut your missiles down.

377
00:16:25.883 --> 00:16:27.723
Or here's a little warning.

378
00:16:27.723 --> 00:16:28.863
We don't know.

379
00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:32.203
Obviously if the UFO cover up, or what I call the truth

380
00:16:32.203 --> 00:16:35.263
embargo was over, if the major investigative journalists

381
00:16:35.263 --> 00:16:37.983
in the country were exploring every aspect of it

382
00:16:37.983 --> 00:16:42.423
going back to '47, if all the living witnesses and also

383
00:16:42.423 --> 00:16:45.514
the living people working within the military intelligence

384
00:16:45.514 --> 00:16:48.934
complex going back were now being vetted, we might know.

385
00:16:48.934 --> 00:16:50.534
<v Regina>We might know.</v>
<v ->But we have to guess.</v>

386
00:16:50.534 --> 00:16:52.654
<v Regina>But one thing seems sure is we're not seeing</v>

387
00:16:52.654 --> 00:16:54.794
major shoot outs above ground coming from craft.

388
00:16:54.794 --> 00:16:57.834
It doesn't appear at this moment, just I would rather

389
00:16:57.834 --> 00:17:01.115
go with the thought that

390
00:17:01.115 --> 00:17:04.555
by and large these might be shows of strength,

391
00:17:04.555 --> 00:17:06.756
but these are not violent,

392
00:17:06.756 --> 00:17:10.416
these are not shows of, how shall we say,

393
00:17:10.416 --> 00:17:12.896
these are not aggressive acts per se.

394
00:17:12.896 --> 00:17:15.276
<v ->I would blame no one for going with that,</v>

395
00:17:15.276 --> 00:17:18.196
but it's not a luxury that I have.

396
00:17:18.196 --> 00:17:20.376
The position of Paradigm Research Group, which is the

397
00:17:20.376 --> 00:17:23.756
organization I founded in '96, is this.

398
00:17:23.756 --> 00:17:26.136
Presence of extraterrestrials is a utterly

399
00:17:26.136 --> 00:17:28.076
non-partisan phenomenon.

400
00:17:28.076 --> 00:17:30.577
There is no evidence that they're here for

401
00:17:30.577 --> 00:17:32.217
rich white people.

402
00:17:32.217 --> 00:17:34.437
There's no evidence they're here for the Catholics

403
00:17:34.437 --> 00:17:36.017
or the Muslims.

404
00:17:36.017 --> 00:17:38.017
They're engaging the whole planet.

405
00:17:38.017 --> 00:17:39.837
It is a global phenomenon.

406
00:17:39.837 --> 00:17:43.497
It is not about politics, per se, in that sense,

407
00:17:43.497 --> 00:17:44.717
so it's non-partisan.

408
00:17:44.717 --> 00:17:46.397
I say actually, but it does have political implications,

409
00:17:46.397 --> 00:17:47.997
lord knows, and so--

410
00:17:47.997 --> 00:17:49.257
<v Regina>But the presence is non-political.</v>

411
00:17:49.257 --> 00:17:52.417
<v ->We don't know yet what their intentions are fully.</v>

412
00:17:52.417 --> 00:17:55.217
We don't know what maybe has happened in the past

413
00:17:55.217 --> 00:17:56.617
in terms of arrangements with them.

414
00:17:56.617 --> 00:17:59.237
We have huge amounts of gaps in information.

415
00:17:59.237 --> 00:18:03.297
We don't know, and so given the fact that there is still

416
00:18:03.297 --> 00:18:05.957
evidence that some untold things are happening,

417
00:18:05.957 --> 00:18:08.117
untoward things are happening, particularly when you

418
00:18:08.117 --> 00:18:09.957
get into the abduction phenomena research,

419
00:18:09.957 --> 00:18:13.117
which I have gotten into fairly well as an observer,

420
00:18:13.117 --> 00:18:16.637
not as a researcher, you cannot dismiss that there may be

421
00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:18.177
hostile intentions here.

422
00:18:18.177 --> 00:18:21.247
<v Regina>But even John Mack, who was one of the</v>

423
00:18:21.247 --> 00:18:23.737
preeminent researchers in the area of the abduction

424
00:18:23.737 --> 00:18:27.217
phenomenon, even he came around to saying, you know,

425
00:18:27.217 --> 00:18:30.058
it appears that there is a presence, it does not,

426
00:18:30.058 --> 00:18:33.858
and the people that have these experiences ultimately have

427
00:18:33.858 --> 00:18:38.299
these feeling of oftentimes appreciation,

428
00:18:38.299 --> 00:18:41.119
oftentimes almost a celestial kind of feeling

429
00:18:41.119 --> 00:18:42.399
about the experience.

430
00:18:42.399 --> 00:18:43.879
There are others that may interpret it differently,

431
00:18:43.879 --> 00:18:45.539
and we have to, there's so much to go in there,

432
00:18:45.539 --> 00:18:46.999
we are not even gonna go there.

433
00:18:46.999 --> 00:18:48.979
But I guess what I am saying is--

434
00:18:48.979 --> 00:18:50.999
<v ->He started out that way.
there is something--

435
00:18:50.999 --> 00:18:52.719
<v ->He started out that way, but toward the end he was</v>

436
00:18:52.719 --> 00:18:53.739
going another direction.

437
00:18:53.739 --> 00:18:56.859
<v Regina>Well, everything I read, I viewed it almost</v>

438
00:18:56.859 --> 00:18:58.499
the opposite.
<v ->Toward the end John was</v>

439
00:18:58.499 --> 00:19:02.429
starting to take a more open minded view that the

440
00:19:02.429 --> 00:19:06.430
activities of these extraterrestrials was not necessarily

441
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:09.490
easy to ascribe benignity.

442
00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:14.321
He started out with a very broad minded, open minded

443
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:20.330
approach, very much emphasizing on spirituality,

444
00:19:20.611 --> 00:19:24.431
consciousness expansion, and so forth, that was his camp.

445
00:19:24.431 --> 00:19:26.491
But he received a lot of pressure over the years,

446
00:19:26.491 --> 00:19:30.291
and just before his death he was starting to consider

447
00:19:30.291 --> 00:19:31.851
the possibility that it wasn't--

448
00:19:31.851 --> 00:19:33.191
<v Regina>Pressure over the years is key.</v>

449
00:19:33.191 --> 00:19:35.231
<v ->No, pressure from arguments, counter arguments.</v>

450
00:19:35.231 --> 00:19:36.831
Remember there are other research out there.

451
00:19:36.831 --> 00:19:40.191
The three top researchers were Mack, Hopkins and Jacobs.

452
00:19:40.191 --> 00:19:44.191
And Hopkins and Jacobs were not in Mack's camp, alright?

453
00:19:44.191 --> 00:19:46.591
He was moving toward their camp at the end.

454
00:19:46.591 --> 00:19:49.131
So again, I wanna make it very clear.

455
00:19:49.131 --> 00:19:52.171
I know I have talked to too many abductees.

456
00:19:52.171 --> 00:19:55.071
They are not happy about this, and some of the actions

457
00:19:55.071 --> 00:19:57.371
of these ETs is unacceptable.

458
00:19:57.371 --> 00:20:02.371
And so I cannot take a position yet that it's all good.

459
00:20:03.011 --> 00:20:04.751
Let's party and have disclosure.

460
00:20:04.751 --> 00:20:07.911
My position is we don't know, and if it's bad,

461
00:20:07.911 --> 00:20:09.891
I can make a very powerful case why all of us

462
00:20:09.891 --> 00:20:12.351
need to be informed tomorrow, alright?

463
00:20:12.351 --> 00:20:14.831
If ETs are coming to colonize us, I'd like all six billion

464
00:20:14.831 --> 00:20:16.731
of us to meet them at the gate.

465
00:20:16.731 --> 00:20:19.541
On the other hand, if it's good, if they are trying to

466
00:20:19.541 --> 00:20:22.890
help us avoid a whole series of calamities which we've

467
00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.190
nicely arranged for ourself, well gee,

468
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.110
I'd like to know that so all six billion of us can join

469
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.250
in the productive activity.

470
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:36.250
Right now it's confined to a cabal of elderly white men,

471
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.110
with military and intelligence background,

472
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:43.010
who in a very narrow sense are defining our history

473
00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.831
and making decisions of monumental importance

474
00:20:45.831 --> 00:20:48.331
on the part of the rest of us.

475
00:20:48.331 --> 00:20:50.771
We're talking about 20 or 30 people that are calling

476
00:20:50.771 --> 00:20:55.771
the shots for 5,990,990,980, right?

477
00:21:00.391 --> 00:21:01.851
I don't wanna operate that way.

478
00:21:01.851 --> 00:21:03.871
I don't want the world to operate that way.

479
00:21:03.871 --> 00:21:08.411
The cabalistic cover up truth embargo needs to end,

480
00:21:08.411 --> 00:21:11.031
and all of us need to get involved to get to the bottom.

481
00:21:11.031 --> 00:21:13.643
Are they good, bad, indifferent?

482
00:21:13.643 --> 00:21:15.063
Are there multiple species?

483
00:21:15.063 --> 00:21:19.003
Are three relatively benign species holding the Borg at bay?

484
00:21:19.003 --> 00:21:20.623
What is our future entail?

485
00:21:20.623 --> 00:21:22.623
Because right now we're asleep.

486
00:21:22.623 --> 00:21:24.223
We can't even take care of ourself.

487
00:21:24.223 --> 00:21:25.963
We can't even take care of our own planet.

488
00:21:25.963 --> 00:21:28.683
And so when you wanna talk about, gee, what is the political

489
00:21:28.683 --> 00:21:31.603
alignment in the exo-political world that we need to

490
00:21:31.603 --> 00:21:34.003
know about that may decide whether or not this planet

491
00:21:34.003 --> 00:21:36.623
is going to be a cinder or essentially not even in

492
00:21:36.623 --> 00:21:39.823
our control 30 years from now, right?

493
00:21:39.823 --> 00:21:41.954
Or are we gonna be in alliance with...

494
00:21:42.703 --> 00:21:44.204
Where's that being discussed?

495
00:21:44.204 --> 00:21:45.424
Where is that in the media?

496
00:21:45.424 --> 00:21:49.624
So the issue is not trying to know now

497
00:21:49.624 --> 00:21:51.215
what do they eat for breakfast?

498
00:21:51.215 --> 00:21:52.415
What is their politics?

499
00:21:52.415 --> 00:21:53.615
What planet do they come from?

500
00:21:53.615 --> 00:21:54.855
Are they good, bad, indifferent?

501
00:21:54.855 --> 00:21:56.235
What do they think of Paris Hilton?

502
00:21:56.235 --> 00:21:59.895
The interest is in the embargo so that the issue then

503
00:21:59.895 --> 00:22:04.475
becomes available for discernment by the entire species

504
00:22:04.475 --> 00:22:07.336
of the planet, and not a limited few.

505
00:22:07.336 --> 00:22:09.256
<v Regina>But just to take a little heat out of it,</v>

506
00:22:09.256 --> 00:22:12.196
empirical evidence is with that kind of technology

507
00:22:12.196 --> 00:22:14.516
they could have controlled us to a much larger extent

508
00:22:14.516 --> 00:22:15.996
by now had they chosen to.

509
00:22:15.996 --> 00:22:18.836
Now no one knows how many species, what motives, etc.

510
00:22:18.836 --> 00:22:21.176
But the fact is, we're all doing it to ourselves,

511
00:22:21.176 --> 00:22:24.096
and that's what the real interest here is that

512
00:22:24.096 --> 00:22:27.216
nothing's being done to us from the outside it would appear

513
00:22:27.216 --> 00:22:30.456
as much as what we are dong to ourselves as the

514
00:22:30.456 --> 00:22:32.776
human species, right?

515
00:22:32.776 --> 00:22:34.756
I mean, is it fair enough to say that?

516
00:22:34.756 --> 00:22:36.736
Are we doing more harm to ourselves than any ETs

517
00:22:36.736 --> 00:22:39.228
are doing to us from outside?

518
00:22:41.358 --> 00:22:43.458
<v ->Let me put it this way, you could say that,</v>

519
00:22:43.458 --> 00:22:46.538
but I mean, the point would not be important enough

520
00:22:46.538 --> 00:22:47.538
to the larger picture.

521
00:22:47.538 --> 00:22:49.598
In other words, look.

522
00:22:51.618 --> 00:22:55.619
When a group of scientists take 20,000 rats and run them

523
00:22:55.619 --> 00:22:59.579
through a series of experiments for 20 or 30 years,

524
00:22:59.579 --> 00:23:03.219
the issue is not how much are they torturing the rats,

525
00:23:03.219 --> 00:23:05.959
or do we feed them well, or what are we doing to them?

526
00:23:05.959 --> 00:23:08.939
The issue is there's 20,000 rats who are involved in

527
00:23:08.939 --> 00:23:13.179
an experiment being run by higher beings.

528
00:23:13.179 --> 00:23:15.359
Is that what's happening to us?

529
00:23:15.359 --> 00:23:18.639
So I want to know what is their relationship to us?

530
00:23:18.639 --> 00:23:22.679
And it doesn't necessarily assuage my concern that

531
00:23:22.679 --> 00:23:25.459
they're not personally coming down here and torturing me.

532
00:23:25.459 --> 00:23:28.969
Let me give you an anecdote from just a couple of weeks ago.

533
00:23:29.549 --> 00:23:34.180
At the Laughlin Conference, the UFO Congress that's

534
00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:38.120
run by Teri and Bob Brown, Hopkins and Jacobs,

535
00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.923
the two remaining top researchers in the world since

536
00:23:39.923 --> 00:23:43.643
Mack's untimely death in London, gave a joint presentation

537
00:23:43.643 --> 00:23:45.703
that was striking.

538
00:23:45.703 --> 00:23:48.663
And they each had about half the time,

539
00:23:48.663 --> 00:23:51.743
and they had some slides, and here was the message

540
00:23:51.743 --> 00:23:53.263
that they were giving.

541
00:23:53.263 --> 00:23:58.023
They were saying, and I'm paraphrasing so I apologize to

542
00:23:58.023 --> 00:24:00.845
David and Bud if I've got it slightly wrong,

543
00:24:00.845 --> 00:24:05.585
is that they are getting a whole striking new set of reports

544
00:24:05.585 --> 00:24:08.365
back from abductees that they are interviewing that

545
00:24:08.365 --> 00:24:10.759
they weren't getting a year and a half ago.

546
00:24:10.759 --> 00:24:12.099
<v Regina>Well, just as an example--</v>

547
00:24:12.099 --> 00:24:15.019
<v ->And the nature of these reports is that abductees</v>

548
00:24:15.019 --> 00:24:17.659
are being taken up into craft, and they are being

549
00:24:17.659 --> 00:24:22.659
participating in efforts to show hybrids how to function

550
00:24:24.859 --> 00:24:27.119
down here on the Earth.

551
00:24:27.119 --> 00:24:30.499
How to buy groceries, how to--

552
00:24:30.499 --> 00:24:31.539
<v Regina>Blend.</v>
drive a car.

553
00:24:31.539 --> 00:24:34.239
<v Regina>How to blend in.</v>
<v ->How to blend in, alright?</v>

554
00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:35.919
<v Regina>Yes, right.</v>

555
00:24:35.919 --> 00:24:39.399
<v ->The implication are is that, and they basically said this,</v>

556
00:24:39.399 --> 00:24:41.839
it's possible that we're right on the verge of a major

557
00:24:41.839 --> 00:24:45.392
inculcation of hybrids into the world.

558
00:24:47.339 --> 00:24:48.682
I don't think anybody wants to jump to

559
00:24:48.682 --> 00:24:49.782
conclusions about that.

560
00:24:49.782 --> 00:24:52.142
I think the fact that they're not teaching them how to

561
00:24:52.142 --> 00:24:54.102
commit mass murder is nice to know.

562
00:24:54.102 --> 00:24:59.102
But it's equally a mistake for the intelligent thinking

563
00:25:02.642 --> 00:25:05.702
good kind people of this world, of which there are

564
00:25:05.702 --> 00:25:09.722
not enough, but still a pretty substantial number,

565
00:25:09.722 --> 00:25:12.342
to jump to the conclusions that everything associated

566
00:25:12.342 --> 00:25:16.222
with these beings is just fun and dandy as it is

567
00:25:16.222 --> 00:25:20.562
for the militarists and the intelligence freaks and the

568
00:25:20.562 --> 00:25:23.142
control freaks that pretty much run the United States,

569
00:25:23.142 --> 00:25:25.162
and have for some time, to jump to the conclusion

570
00:25:25.162 --> 00:25:30.162
these entities are absolutely vile, and must be resisted

571
00:25:30.302 --> 00:25:32.242
at all costs, and they're prepared to spend trillions

572
00:25:32.242 --> 00:25:34.822
of dollars on quote, anti-ET weapons.

573
00:25:34.822 --> 00:25:39.602
Both points of view are premature.

574
00:25:39.602 --> 00:25:42.362
<v Regina>But if you look at one, the latter</v>

575
00:25:42.362 --> 00:25:45.002
you just mentioned, you always have to follow the money.

576
00:25:45.002 --> 00:25:48.102
Who stands to gain from creating these anti-ET weapons?

577
00:25:48.102 --> 00:25:50.002
You're always going back to the same thing over and over.

578
00:25:50.002 --> 00:25:52.802
You create enemies, somebody has a lot to gain.

579
00:25:52.802 --> 00:25:54.942
I always look at that one almost number one.

580
00:25:54.942 --> 00:25:58.222
Who stands to gain by creating fear of any kind?

581
00:25:58.222 --> 00:26:01.982
And that doesn't discount the fact that we don't know

582
00:26:01.982 --> 00:26:04.742
who the other beings are that are visiting this planet.

583
00:26:04.742 --> 00:26:08.782
Empirically they don't seem to be creating large events

584
00:26:08.782 --> 00:26:10.962
of any kind we can see in our cities.

585
00:26:10.962 --> 00:26:14.422
Yes, maybe they are being taught how to shop

586
00:26:14.422 --> 00:26:16.737
so they can blend and things like this.

587
00:26:16.737 --> 00:26:21.477
We're not seeing any terror at this moment.

588
00:26:21.477 --> 00:26:24.357
<v ->I can get you in touch with some abductees that will</v>

589
00:26:24.357 --> 00:26:26.662
strongly disagree.
<v Regina>I know there are</v>

590
00:26:26.662 --> 00:26:28.842
some abductee stories about some of the very unpleasant

591
00:26:28.842 --> 00:26:30.942
things that have happened to them in their experience,

592
00:26:30.942 --> 00:26:33.342
during these experiences.

593
00:26:33.342 --> 00:26:35.722
But nonetheless I think what I'm saying is again,

594
00:26:35.722 --> 00:26:36.922
always follow the money.

595
00:26:36.922 --> 00:26:38.082
Who's making the statements?

596
00:26:38.082 --> 00:26:39.322
Where does the fear come from?

597
00:26:39.322 --> 00:26:40.982
Who stands to gain from those contracts that are making

598
00:26:40.982 --> 00:26:43.002
these anti-ET weapons?

599
00:26:43.002 --> 00:26:44.862
It keeps going back to the same people that are

600
00:26:44.862 --> 00:26:46.562
generating the fear.

601
00:26:46.562 --> 00:26:51.562
<v ->This is certainly, the follow the money argument is</v>

602
00:26:51.816 --> 00:26:54.017
very much in vogue.

603
00:26:54.017 --> 00:26:56.097
It does have a rational basis.

604
00:26:56.097 --> 00:26:58.757
It's only one aspect, though.

605
00:26:58.757 --> 00:27:02.828
If I go out tomorrow and have a serious car accident,

606
00:27:03.857 --> 00:27:06.428
the hospital that receives my insurance money

607
00:27:06.428 --> 00:27:07.759
benefits from it.

608
00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:10.519
That doesn't mean that a hospital employee was out there,

609
00:27:10.519 --> 00:27:13.039
you know, driving me off the road.

610
00:27:13.039 --> 00:27:16.219
There is ample evidence of ET presence completely

611
00:27:16.219 --> 00:27:17.899
independent of money--

612
00:27:17.899 --> 00:27:19.599
<v Regina>Right, absolutely.</v>
and completely independent--

613
00:27:19.599 --> 00:27:20.999
of the money interest.
<v Regina>That's true.</v>

614
00:27:20.999 --> 00:27:25.999
<v ->And so while that concern certainly should never</v>

615
00:27:26.899 --> 00:27:29.399
be dismissed, who's benefiting from what,

616
00:27:29.399 --> 00:27:31.459
the overall picture has got to be considered.

617
00:27:31.459 --> 00:27:32.979
That's only one part of it.

618
00:27:32.979 --> 00:27:34.059
<v Regina>And this I agree with.</v>

619
00:27:34.059 --> 00:27:36.159
<v ->Let me make a key point, here is the key point.</v>

620
00:27:36.159 --> 00:27:38.159
This is the message that I'm sending right out

621
00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:39.779
through this camera, OK?

622
00:27:39.779 --> 00:27:42.059
To everyone that's gonna listen to this.

623
00:27:42.059 --> 00:27:45.239
One of my concerns as a political activist on this issue

624
00:27:45.239 --> 00:27:48.659
is that a whole lot of very nice people, good people with

625
00:27:48.659 --> 00:27:52.039
good hearts, right, who wish the ETs well,

626
00:27:52.039 --> 00:27:55.279
they wish the human race well and everybody else,

627
00:27:55.279 --> 00:27:59.679
who are getting interested in this issue,

628
00:27:59.679 --> 00:28:03.579
who are taking this view that, you know,

629
00:28:03.579 --> 00:28:05.019
I think it's all good.

630
00:28:05.019 --> 00:28:08.079
And since it's all good, I'm just gonna kinda sit back,

631
00:28:08.079 --> 00:28:09.779
and it'll all work out.

632
00:28:09.779 --> 00:28:12.679
I don't need to press the press, the media.

633
00:28:12.679 --> 00:28:14.399
I don't need to press the political candidates.

634
00:28:14.399 --> 00:28:15.619
I don't need to cause a fuss.

635
00:28:15.619 --> 00:28:18.659
I don't need to support any activism because it's all good.

636
00:28:18.659 --> 00:28:20.799
And I'll wait for it to all work out.

637
00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:22.019
I think they're makin' a mistake.

638
00:28:22.019 --> 00:28:23.779
<v Regina>OK, now wait a minute, but that is assuming</v>

639
00:28:23.779 --> 00:28:26.799
that we are only driven by fear, not genuine curiosity

640
00:28:26.799 --> 00:28:28.159
and looking for right.

641
00:28:28.159 --> 00:28:30.119
And that I would take exception to.

642
00:28:30.119 --> 00:28:31.880
I don't think most people watching this are

643
00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.160
only driven by fear.

644
00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.660
The fact is that that information has been suppressed

645
00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:39.700
all of these years, and that these incredibly brave

646
00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.760
human beings have come forward and put themselves

647
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.640
on the line to say these experiences have existed.

648
00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.560
Doesn't have to be a fear-based drive for that information

649
00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.240
to be released.
<v ->No, it doesn't, but I can say</v>

650
00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:55.240
from 10 years of experience that a whole lot of

651
00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.880
good people who know about this issue

652
00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.700
and have the resources to engage the political action here

653
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.140
simply are not doing it.

654
00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:08.460
There is not a single person in the good group,

655
00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:13.140
the good, kind, thoughtful, progressive group.

656
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.060
<v Regina>So you're saying fear is a greater drive</v>

657
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.380
to actually get something done.

658
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.100
<v ->I'm saying that they're making a mistake by taking</v>

659
00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:21.680
the view that I'm not gonna be fear driven.

660
00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.600
I think these ETs are good, so therefore I see no need

661
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.200
to challenge the government on this issue.

662
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.300
I see no need to be politically active on this issue.

663
00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.040
<v Regina>I say you do both.</v>
<v ->I'm just gonna stand back.</v>

664
00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.380
<v Regina>The government should definitely be challenged.</v>

665
00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.860
So should the press, and not only that.

666
00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:34.920
<v ->But they're not doing it.</v>

667
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.522
<v Regina>This goes high up, though, in terms of</v>

668
00:29:36.522 --> 00:29:37.982
the challenge, and there are a couple of things

669
00:29:37.982 --> 00:29:40.422
I wanna get to about Philip Corso and all down the road,

670
00:29:40.422 --> 00:29:43.403
but first of all where you are right now in all of this,

671
00:29:43.403 --> 00:29:45.183
this goes deeply into politics.

672
00:29:45.183 --> 00:29:48.963
President Kennedy asked upon his, after inauguration,

673
00:29:48.963 --> 00:29:50.983
so tell me, what is the deal with ETs?

674
00:29:50.983 --> 00:29:53.543
Because it was a hot issue at that time in the '60s.

675
00:29:53.543 --> 00:29:56.703
That information, from my understanding,

676
00:29:56.703 --> 00:29:58.303
and please correct me if I'm wrong in this,

677
00:29:58.303 --> 00:30:01.723
was he was not considered to be in a need-to-know

678
00:30:01.723 --> 00:30:03.063
basis on this.

679
00:30:03.063 --> 00:30:04.983
What happened after that?
<v ->A little bit of evidence.</v>

680
00:30:04.983 --> 00:30:06.523
A little bit of evidence to that.

681
00:30:06.523 --> 00:30:09.903
<v Regina>And Jimmy Carter, and on and on.</v>

682
00:30:09.903 --> 00:30:13.003
<v ->Well, I can give you a very short answer to that.</v>

683
00:30:13.003 --> 00:30:17.703
Grant Cameron and I have co-written a book

684
00:30:17.703 --> 00:30:21.723
that's in extensive draft, long draft,

685
00:30:21.723 --> 00:30:24.704
called U.S. Presidents and the Politics of Disclosure,

686
00:30:24.704 --> 00:30:27.284
which talks about the interaction of this issue

687
00:30:27.284 --> 00:30:30.584
with Presidents going all the way back to Truman.

688
00:30:30.584 --> 00:30:34.344
And so particularly Grant Cameron, alright,

689
00:30:34.344 --> 00:30:36.904
who has a substantial website on the net that can be

690
00:30:36.904 --> 00:30:41.104
Google'd easily, knows a great deal about this issue.

691
00:30:42.334 --> 00:30:45.244
I got a top agent in New York, and that top agent

692
00:30:45.244 --> 00:30:48.444
presented that book, which is loaded with great stuff,

693
00:30:48.444 --> 00:30:50.784
to every major publisher in New York,

694
00:30:50.784 --> 00:30:52.604
and every single one of them turned it down.

695
00:30:52.604 --> 00:30:54.664
And they basically most of them were saying, you know,

696
00:30:54.664 --> 00:30:57.744
this is not a bad book but you know we couldn't do that now.

697
00:30:57.744 --> 00:30:59.764
The fact is that not all Presidents are given

698
00:30:59.764 --> 00:31:01.424
the same amount of information.

699
00:31:01.424 --> 00:31:03.104
As we've gotten closer to the present,

700
00:31:03.104 --> 00:31:05.624
present Democratic Presidents are much more likely

701
00:31:05.624 --> 00:31:07.704
to get less information, OK?

702
00:31:07.704 --> 00:31:09.964
Because the military intelligence community is now

703
00:31:09.964 --> 00:31:12.544
heavily Republican.

704
00:31:12.544 --> 00:31:17.544
Used to be about 12% Republican, eight percent Democrat,

705
00:31:17.764 --> 00:31:19.184
the rest was independent.

706
00:31:19.184 --> 00:31:20.804
Now it's around, and I have to get my figures,

707
00:31:20.804 --> 00:31:24.084
70% Republican, 12% Democratic.

708
00:31:24.084 --> 00:31:27.064
In the last 35 years our military intelligence community

709
00:31:27.064 --> 00:31:30.444
became partisanized, and no one paid attention,

710
00:31:30.444 --> 00:31:32.944
not even our fine upstanding news media.

711
00:31:32.944 --> 00:31:36.724
Meaning we have a Republican military intelligence complex.

712
00:31:36.724 --> 00:31:38.024
Now does that mean they're bad?

713
00:31:38.024 --> 00:31:42.044
No, but it means that they are affiliated.

714
00:31:42.044 --> 00:31:45.624
In the old days the military people,

715
00:31:45.624 --> 00:31:48.404
they registered independent because they felt that

716
00:31:48.404 --> 00:31:50.224
their role was non-partisan.

717
00:31:50.224 --> 00:31:51.906
They're here to defend the country, not just their

718
00:31:51.906 --> 00:31:53.444
Republican or Democratic buddies.

719
00:31:53.444 --> 00:31:55.424
But that's all changed.

720
00:31:55.424 --> 00:31:57.744
Now they're basically heavily registered,

721
00:31:57.744 --> 00:31:59.464
four or five to one Republican.

722
00:31:59.464 --> 00:32:01.924
So does it surprise anybody that since the 1970's

723
00:32:01.924 --> 00:32:03.904
Republican Presidents have been given more information

724
00:32:03.904 --> 00:32:05.184
than Democratic Presidents?

725
00:32:05.184 --> 00:32:06.824
Meaning you know, it's like--

726
00:32:06.824 --> 00:32:08.304
<v Regina>This is true because the only ones that I've</v>

727
00:32:08.304 --> 00:32:10.124
really heard about are the ones that were denied access,

728
00:32:10.124 --> 00:32:11.404
and it's right--
<v ->You got it.</v>

729
00:32:11.404 --> 00:32:12.644
every one of them were Democrats.

730
00:32:12.644 --> 00:32:14.444
<v ->You got it, and of course I could spend, I have a</v>

731
00:32:14.444 --> 00:32:16.984
presentation that goes into the Clinton administration.

732
00:32:16.984 --> 00:32:18.304
It's two and a half hours long.

733
00:32:18.304 --> 00:32:19.564
It'll blow your mind.

734
00:32:19.564 --> 00:32:21.644
<v Regina>Well, can you get into just a little bit of it</v>

735
00:32:21.644 --> 00:32:23.284
right now to find out where we are politically

736
00:32:23.284 --> 00:32:24.884
with this issue and who says of the last

737
00:32:24.884 --> 00:32:26.004
Democratic President.

738
00:32:26.004 --> 00:32:28.604
<v ->Shorthand, in 1993 a sign of the most powerful,</v>

739
00:32:28.604 --> 00:32:30.504
one of the most powerful American families,

740
00:32:30.504 --> 00:32:32.424
the Rockefellers, Lawrence Rockefeller approached

741
00:32:32.424 --> 00:32:34.824
the President through his Office of Science and

742
00:32:34.824 --> 00:32:37.164
Technology Chief, John Gibbons.

743
00:32:37.164 --> 00:32:40.384
Henry Diamond, Lawrence Rockefeller's attorney made

744
00:32:40.384 --> 00:32:41.644
the initial approach,

745
00:32:41.644 --> 00:32:43.284
and Rockefeller's intention was quite clear.

746
00:32:43.284 --> 00:32:47.484
He wanted Bill Clinton to end the UFO cover up.

747
00:32:47.484 --> 00:32:48.604
And they spent three years.

748
00:32:48.604 --> 00:32:50.744
Meetings were held, research papers were put together.

749
00:32:50.744 --> 00:32:52.604
All this was going over at Gibbons' office,

750
00:32:52.604 --> 00:32:55.385
and everybody in the executive at the high end

751
00:32:55.385 --> 00:32:58.105
knew about it, though they've never said so.

752
00:32:58.105 --> 00:32:59.645
Bill Clinton knew about it, Hillary knew about it,

753
00:32:59.645 --> 00:33:02.225
John Podesta, his chief aide on security issues

754
00:33:02.225 --> 00:33:04.799
at the time knew about it, but they didn't get involved

755
00:33:04.799 --> 00:33:07.239
because this was the buffer, in a sense.

756
00:33:07.239 --> 00:33:10.019
And primarily because of the attacks that rained down

757
00:33:10.019 --> 00:33:11.719
on Clinton, which I believe were connected to this

758
00:33:11.719 --> 00:33:15.059
UFO engagement by, the UFO issue engagement by

759
00:33:15.059 --> 00:33:16.359
Lawrence Rockefeller.

760
00:33:16.359 --> 00:33:18.459
That's why they went after Clinton, not because of adultery.

761
00:33:18.459 --> 00:33:19.899
Hell, most of the Republicans in town are

762
00:33:19.899 --> 00:33:21.039
committing adultery.

763
00:33:21.039 --> 00:33:22.159
Not because of some scandal.

764
00:33:22.159 --> 00:33:23.399
<v Regina>Well, you're there, I guess you'd know.</v>

765
00:33:23.399 --> 00:33:26.040
<v ->Yeah, not some kind of scandal like Whitewater.</v>

766
00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.979
Most Republicans would consider Whitewater

767
00:33:27.979 --> 00:33:29.919
a joke as a scandal.

768
00:33:29.919 --> 00:33:31.639
I mean, they don't even get to scandal level

769
00:33:31.639 --> 00:33:33.160
until you get up to 20, 30 million range.

770
00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.160
She you got what?

771
00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.240
A hundred thousand dollars in beef futures?

772
00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.000
It was a joke nobody could understand.

773
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.980
Why was everybody after, why did they come down

774
00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.900
on Clinton so hard, so fast?

775
00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:45.740
Why did they indict Wester Hubbell for everything,

776
00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:46.861
including the sinking of the Maine?

777
00:33:46.861 --> 00:33:48.281
<v Regina>Just to make it clear in one sentence,</v>

778
00:33:48.281 --> 00:33:49.921
why did they you're saying.
<v ->I believe it was because</v>

779
00:33:49.921 --> 00:33:52.321
when they found out that Lawrence Rockefeller was

780
00:33:52.321 --> 00:33:54.581
engaging the administration to become the disclosure

781
00:33:54.581 --> 00:33:57.521
presidency, and he was being received,

782
00:33:57.521 --> 00:33:59.761
the thing was actually, discussions were being held

783
00:33:59.761 --> 00:34:03.421
in the OSTP Office, and that Clinton told Hubbell to go

784
00:34:03.421 --> 00:34:05.783
look into the issue with Justice,

785
00:34:05.783 --> 00:34:08.143
people in the intelligence community decided that

786
00:34:08.143 --> 00:34:10.943
they had to get rid of him by the end of that term.

787
00:34:10.943 --> 00:34:14.783
I believe they opened up files to Mellons, Gaith and others,

788
00:34:14.783 --> 00:34:17.844
and said look, here's all his mistresses, here's the dates

789
00:34:17.844 --> 00:34:19.924
and the times and everything, 'cause they have to vet

790
00:34:19.924 --> 00:34:22.124
every person that gets close to the presidency.

791
00:34:22.124 --> 00:34:24.164
They have files like this, but they're supposed to be

792
00:34:24.164 --> 00:34:27.644
(claps) secured, under no circumstance ever used

793
00:34:27.644 --> 00:34:29.324
in a partisan political way.

794
00:34:29.324 --> 00:34:30.884
They're simply there to protect the national

795
00:34:30.884 --> 00:34:32.124
security interests.

796
00:34:32.124 --> 00:34:34.364
I think those files got opened, and that's what caused

797
00:34:34.364 --> 00:34:35.624
the attacks on Clinton.
<v Regina>Certainly Monica</v>

798
00:34:35.624 --> 00:34:37.364
didn't affect national security.

799
00:34:37.364 --> 00:34:39.924
<v ->Oh she did, oh she did, but not in a way that</v>

800
00:34:39.924 --> 00:34:42.274
would be appropriate.

801
00:34:42.274 --> 00:34:43.977
The real story of the Clinton administration

802
00:34:43.977 --> 00:34:45.037
has not been told,

803
00:34:45.037 --> 00:34:47.137
and one of the reasons it hasn't been told

804
00:34:47.137 --> 00:34:49.517
is because of the extraordinary circumstance in which

805
00:34:49.517 --> 00:34:51.897
you have a President who went through some pretty

806
00:34:51.897 --> 00:34:55.957
amazing things, who could have simply left the office,

807
00:34:55.957 --> 00:34:58.857
written a couple of books and turned the world on its ear.

808
00:34:58.857 --> 00:35:00.597
He just happened to have a wife that plans on

809
00:35:00.597 --> 00:35:02.017
becoming President.

810
00:35:02.017 --> 00:35:03.317
It's a problem, isn't it?
<v Regina>Well, he has some</v>

811
00:35:03.317 --> 00:35:04.957
new best friends, too.

812
00:35:04.957 --> 00:35:08.337
<v ->Well, that may be related to that, but just on that</v>

813
00:35:08.337 --> 00:35:11.697
basis alone no ex-President that I'm aware of in the

814
00:35:11.697 --> 00:35:14.897
modern era, and maybe none in history,

815
00:35:14.897 --> 00:35:19.217
has ever left the office knowing that his wife had

816
00:35:19.217 --> 00:35:22.397
a pretty good shot to be President very soon.

817
00:35:22.397 --> 00:35:25.477
Completely affects what he may or may not say or do.

818
00:35:25.477 --> 00:35:26.297
<v Regina>Right.</v>
<v ->Right?</v>

819
00:35:26.297 --> 00:35:28.657
Why Carter is keeping quiet on this is not clear.

820
00:35:28.657 --> 00:35:30.197
I think Carter was threatened.

821
00:35:30.197 --> 00:35:33.137
I think he was really threatened because what he tried to do

822
00:35:33.137 --> 00:35:38.137
was in the early period, it was in 1977, way too soon.

823
00:35:38.977 --> 00:35:41.517
And so when Carter started up two extraterrestrial studies

824
00:35:41.517 --> 00:35:44.617
out of the White House, the hammer came down on him

825
00:35:44.617 --> 00:35:45.957
just like it did on Bill Clinton.

826
00:35:45.957 --> 00:35:47.957
<v Regina>Because he had had a personal experience,</v>

827
00:35:47.957 --> 00:35:49.517
which is what encouraged him--
<v ->He had a sighting.</v>

828
00:35:49.517 --> 00:35:50.977
He'd had a sighting.

829
00:35:50.977 --> 00:35:52.337
<v ->And he mentioned it in the campaign.</v>

830
00:35:52.337 --> 00:35:53.897
<v Regina>Yes, he did.</v>
<v ->What a radical idea.</v>

831
00:35:53.897 --> 00:35:55.637
He actually said something truthful in the campaign

832
00:35:55.637 --> 00:35:56.877
about something that happened to him.

833
00:35:56.877 --> 00:35:58.977
Got tens of thousands of letters, actually started

834
00:35:58.977 --> 00:36:01.277
two studies, and they came down on Carter

835
00:36:01.277 --> 00:36:02.657
with an iron fist.
<v Regina>Who was the head</v>

836
00:36:02.657 --> 00:36:03.777
of the CIA at that time?

837
00:36:03.777 --> 00:36:05.557
<v ->Well, the first person that basically told him to</v>

838
00:36:05.557 --> 00:36:07.557
go pound sand was George H.W. Bush.

839
00:36:07.557 --> 00:36:08.357
<v Regina>Right.</v>

840
00:36:08.357 --> 00:36:09.697
<v ->He came to Bush and said I'd like to look into</v>

841
00:36:09.697 --> 00:36:10.717
this ET thing.

842
00:36:10.717 --> 00:36:13.257
I think Bush must have just laughed like crazy,

843
00:36:13.257 --> 00:36:14.877
and just said forget it, go see Congress.

844
00:36:14.877 --> 00:36:16.977
Then he went to NASA, and they told him forget it, Jimmy.

845
00:36:16.977 --> 00:36:18.977
There was no respect for Jimmy Carter when he came in,

846
00:36:18.977 --> 00:36:23.137
and he was a military guy, Navy guy, nuclear physicist.

847
00:36:23.137 --> 00:36:25.717
But you know, he was not a Republican,

848
00:36:25.717 --> 00:36:29.206
and he was not considered fit to know the real truth

849
00:36:29.206 --> 00:36:31.386
about things by that little group that knows.

850
00:36:31.386 --> 00:36:32.926
<v Regina>Not on a need to know basis.</v>

851
00:36:32.926 --> 00:36:36.226
<v ->He wasn't able to handle the truth.</v>

852
00:36:36.226 --> 00:36:39.186
This is the politics of the last 40 years,

853
00:36:39.186 --> 00:36:44.186
and it's this screwball, absurd approach that emerged

854
00:36:45.186 --> 00:36:48.617
out of the Cold War and the secret empire that was

855
00:36:48.617 --> 00:36:50.857
being built that's headed to taking the country

856
00:36:50.857 --> 00:36:52.437
over the cliff.

857
00:36:52.437 --> 00:36:55.897
The effect of the secret empire, which was created

858
00:36:55.897 --> 00:36:58.837
for two reasons, one, to defeat the Soviet Union,

859
00:36:58.837 --> 00:37:01.457
which unfortunately we encouraged to become our

860
00:37:01.457 --> 00:37:03.317
vicious enemy after the war, though they didn't need

861
00:37:03.317 --> 00:37:05.437
a lot of encouragement, and they were led by a man who,

862
00:37:05.437 --> 00:37:08.337
if he isn't in hell, hopefully will get there eventually.

863
00:37:08.337 --> 00:37:10.577
And also because they knew ETs were here.

864
00:37:10.577 --> 00:37:12.417
They knew ETs were here as early as the middle 40's.

865
00:37:12.417 --> 00:37:14.437
So they had to deal with those two issues,

866
00:37:14.437 --> 00:37:15.997
and they create this huge secret empire

867
00:37:15.997 --> 00:37:17.397
which became out of control.

868
00:37:17.397 --> 00:37:20.437
It's now massive, OK?

869
00:37:20.437 --> 00:37:24.817
And as a result it's become like a huge gravitational force

870
00:37:24.817 --> 00:37:28.077
that has been warping every other aspect of

871
00:37:28.077 --> 00:37:30.717
American governance, changing the relationships between

872
00:37:30.717 --> 00:37:34.317
the Congress and the DOD and the NSA and the President

873
00:37:34.317 --> 00:37:35.437
and the President and the Congress,

874
00:37:35.437 --> 00:37:38.977
warping the relationships just like a huge dysfunctionality

875
00:37:38.977 --> 00:37:41.817
in the middle of a family warps the relationships between

876
00:37:41.817 --> 00:37:43.497
the husband and the wife and the wife and the daughter

877
00:37:43.497 --> 00:37:45.277
and the son and the father, until the whole family

878
00:37:45.277 --> 00:37:47.417
is screwed up, and they're all in rehab.

879
00:37:47.417 --> 00:37:48.537
That's what's going on.

880
00:37:48.537 --> 00:37:49.717
<v Regina>Well, if we were only in rehab,</v>

881
00:37:49.717 --> 00:37:51.017
that would be a step forward.

882
00:37:51.017 --> 00:37:53.017
<v ->We're going to rehab one way or another.</v>

883
00:37:53.017 --> 00:37:54.297
(both laughing)

884
00:37:54.297 --> 00:37:55.577
<v Regina>But let me bring something up here.</v>

885
00:37:55.577 --> 00:37:59.377
My understanding is that a number of the various

886
00:37:59.377 --> 00:38:03.917
secret or intelligence agencies, was it even the NSA,

887
00:38:03.917 --> 00:38:07.837
a lot of this was actually in response to the various

888
00:38:07.837 --> 00:38:11.077
events that took place in the 1940's regarding UFOs,

889
00:38:11.077 --> 00:38:12.937
including the crash at Roswell.

890
00:38:12.937 --> 00:38:13.917
<v ->Oh, absolutely.</v>

891
00:38:13.917 --> 00:38:15.297
<v Regina>They were in response to that.</v>

892
00:38:15.297 --> 00:38:17.357
Most people don't know this.

893
00:38:17.357 --> 00:38:20.937
<v ->There's a hidden history of the 20th century, alright?</v>

894
00:38:20.937 --> 00:38:23.977
The government said look, we have to just,

895
00:38:23.977 --> 00:38:24.997
and this happened before.

896
00:38:24.997 --> 00:38:26.717
Remember how the Soviets were constantly

897
00:38:26.717 --> 00:38:28.597
airbrushing people out of photos?

898
00:38:28.597 --> 00:38:29.917
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>
<v ->To change history, OK.</v>

899
00:38:29.917 --> 00:38:31.397
We would do the same thing.

900
00:38:31.397 --> 00:38:33.237
Basically they said look, we're gonna create,

901
00:38:33.237 --> 00:38:36.357
there is gonna be a hidden history from 1947 on until

902
00:38:36.357 --> 00:38:39.537
some unspecified date that the public can't know about.

903
00:38:39.537 --> 00:38:41.097
So they're gonna know about this,

904
00:38:41.097 --> 00:38:42.297
but they can't know about this.

905
00:38:42.297 --> 00:38:44.937
And so there is this parallel history that's going on,

906
00:38:44.937 --> 00:38:46.497
and the press laid down on this issue.

907
00:38:46.497 --> 00:38:48.777
They basically said OK, you wanna hide it, we'll hide it.

908
00:38:48.777 --> 00:38:51.057
Now where these deals were struck and who, I don't know,

909
00:38:51.057 --> 00:38:52.717
it doesn't matter, they were definitely struck because

910
00:38:52.717 --> 00:38:54.177
I know plenty of media, I know plenty of,

911
00:38:54.177 --> 00:38:56.917
I like journalism, I respect journalists.

912
00:38:56.917 --> 00:39:00.317
They're critical to our salvation, and so I know that

913
00:39:00.317 --> 00:39:03.977
they're not stupid enough to have been bamboozled about

914
00:39:03.977 --> 00:39:06.317
an entire hidden history of the 20th century.

915
00:39:06.317 --> 00:39:08.265
So there were arrangements made somewhere,

916
00:39:08.265 --> 00:39:09.535
and then it worked out.

917
00:39:09.535 --> 00:39:13.375
That hidden history is that in addition to the Soviet

918
00:39:13.375 --> 00:39:17.775
threat and the Cold War, there was an entire separate

919
00:39:17.775 --> 00:39:20.415
motivation for the creation of the National Security Act,

920
00:39:20.415 --> 00:39:25.415
the CIA, the NSA, underground facilities, bases in the west,

921
00:39:25.415 --> 00:39:28.375
certain kinds of weapon systems, and on and on and on.

922
00:39:28.375 --> 00:39:31.515
But the beauty of it, conveniently so, I think it was just

923
00:39:31.515 --> 00:39:33.655
an accident, I don't think they contrived it,

924
00:39:33.655 --> 00:39:36.495
was that the other history, the Soviet threat and

925
00:39:36.495 --> 00:39:39.475
the Cold War, was the perfect cover for this history.

926
00:39:39.475 --> 00:39:42.521
And so they were able to completely subsume this.

927
00:39:42.521 --> 00:39:46.181
But the problem here, it's like the hidden second body

928
00:39:46.181 --> 00:39:49.493
in a binary star system where they've got a star up there,

929
00:39:49.493 --> 00:39:50.735
and they've got planets going around,

930
00:39:50.735 --> 00:39:53.115
and it don't quite operate right.

931
00:39:53.115 --> 00:39:55.096
And they're going, you know, it doesn't make sense

932
00:39:55.096 --> 00:40:00.096
unless there's a brown dwarf binary star that you can't see

933
00:40:00.576 --> 00:40:03.336
going around the other one, then it all works.

934
00:40:03.336 --> 00:40:08.336
The entire extraterrestrial issue is the hidden binary dwarf

935
00:40:09.082 --> 00:40:14.082
that's been orbiting the reality of the 20th century,

936
00:40:14.442 --> 00:40:17.722
and because it wasn't fully vetted, it wasn't fully

937
00:40:17.722 --> 00:40:22.722
acknowledged, it created these unknown, unexplainable things

938
00:40:24.722 --> 00:40:27.802
that the politicians and the historians and others

939
00:40:27.802 --> 00:40:29.202
couldn't understand.

940
00:40:29.202 --> 00:40:31.582
In other words, this shouldn't be happening

941
00:40:31.582 --> 00:40:33.302
unless there is this, but they didn't know about this,

942
00:40:33.302 --> 00:40:34.402
or they weren't allowed to know about this.

943
00:40:34.402 --> 00:40:35.382
<v Regina>Right, right.</v>

944
00:40:35.382 --> 00:40:36.522
<v ->That's not good.</v>

945
00:40:36.522 --> 00:40:40.662
When you got a planet that's going from 1.5 billion people

946
00:40:40.662 --> 00:40:44.902
in the year 1900 to six billion people in the year 2000

947
00:40:44.902 --> 00:40:47.622
to nine billion people in the years 2050,

948
00:40:47.622 --> 00:40:50.042
when its technology curve is going straight up to the point

949
00:40:50.042 --> 00:40:52.082
where hell, high school kids will have their own

950
00:40:52.082 --> 00:40:54.342
nuclear weapons in ten years,

951
00:40:54.342 --> 00:40:56.842
you can't have a hidden history like that.

952
00:40:56.842 --> 00:40:59.922
If you subtract a history like that, then you've got

953
00:40:59.922 --> 00:41:03.102
something that's going right (claps) over the cliff.

954
00:41:03.102 --> 00:41:06.282
I'm talking destruction of civilization.

955
00:41:06.282 --> 00:41:08.362
I'm talking turnarounds like the United States

956
00:41:08.362 --> 00:41:10.522
becoming second world.

957
00:41:10.522 --> 00:41:12.822
I'm talking massive environmental destruction.

958
00:41:12.822 --> 00:41:15.242
I'm talking about the inability to deal with meteors

959
00:41:15.242 --> 00:41:17.702
coming from space, diseases emerging,

960
00:41:17.702 --> 00:41:18.942
and a thousand other things.

961
00:41:18.942 --> 00:41:21.622
I'm talking about a breakdown in the fundamental ability

962
00:41:21.622 --> 00:41:25.142
of an extremely expanding group of human beings

963
00:41:25.142 --> 00:41:27.442
to deal with the finite realities of their planet

964
00:41:27.442 --> 00:41:30.102
to the point where it all falls apart.

965
00:41:30.102 --> 00:41:33.262
And what you've got is six billion people running around

966
00:41:33.262 --> 00:41:34.904
heavily armed, really angry.

967
00:41:34.904 --> 00:41:37.284
That's where we're going because there's this

968
00:41:37.284 --> 00:41:41.924
dark star, this component of a secret empire

969
00:41:41.924 --> 00:41:44.344
which has been withheld from everybody on the planet

970
00:41:44.344 --> 00:41:47.924
except a limited few that's skewing everything up,

971
00:41:47.924 --> 00:41:49.944
and I use the word skewing

972
00:41:49.944 --> 00:41:52.284
deliberately--
<v Regina>Skewing, yes.</v>

973
00:41:52.284 --> 00:41:55.344
so that we can't make things work.

974
00:41:55.344 --> 00:41:58.164
See the two party problem, the Republicans and

975
00:41:58.164 --> 00:41:59.464
the Democrats are all the same.

976
00:41:59.464 --> 00:42:00.604
Why can't we make that work?

977
00:42:00.604 --> 00:42:01.584
Well, we don't know.

978
00:42:01.584 --> 00:42:02.384
The environmental thing?

979
00:42:02.384 --> 00:42:03.664
Why can't we really deal with the oil issue?

980
00:42:03.664 --> 00:42:04.404
I don't know.

981
00:42:04.404 --> 00:42:06.564
Why didn't we jump on that ozone thing earlier?

982
00:42:06.564 --> 00:42:07.404
I don't know.

983
00:42:07.404 --> 00:42:10.284
Why are we only spending a couple million dollars a year

984
00:42:10.284 --> 00:42:13.565
to deal with the possibility of a meteor impact

985
00:42:13.565 --> 00:42:15.365
which would destroy civilization?

986
00:42:15.365 --> 00:42:20.365
We spend less on trying to detect near Earth objects

987
00:42:20.365 --> 00:42:23.705
than any typical billionaire in this country spends

988
00:42:23.705 --> 00:42:26.145
on their public relations.

989
00:42:26.145 --> 00:42:27.785
Why?

990
00:42:27.785 --> 00:42:30.285
All these answers, nobody has answers for any of this

991
00:42:30.285 --> 00:42:32.525
because they don't know about this.

992
00:42:32.525 --> 00:42:37.485
Now this is why anybody that comes to me and says

993
00:42:37.485 --> 00:42:39.845
ETs are good, and I can't wait for them to get here.

994
00:42:39.845 --> 00:42:40.945
Well, what are you gonna do about getting

995
00:42:40.945 --> 00:42:42.025
the information out?

996
00:42:42.025 --> 00:42:43.165
I can't help.

997
00:42:43.165 --> 00:42:46.405
I'm going you better help because if things go down,

998
00:42:46.405 --> 00:42:48.725
it's not gonna be just the bad people.

999
00:42:48.725 --> 00:42:51.545
A lot of good people are gonna be saying, why me?

1000
00:42:51.545 --> 00:42:55.525
I love, I love, I love, I love life, I love people,

1001
00:42:55.525 --> 00:42:57.985
I'm good, I'm kind, I think the ETs are wonderful.

1002
00:42:57.985 --> 00:43:00.325
Why is my life about to be ruined?

1003
00:43:00.325 --> 00:43:01.865
There were an awful lot of good people in that

1004
00:43:01.865 --> 00:43:04.365
World Trade Center that day sitting there, you know.

1005
00:43:04.365 --> 00:43:06.885
They give to charity, they take care of their kids,

1006
00:43:06.885 --> 00:43:09.785
they're responsible, and they're truth telling,

1007
00:43:09.785 --> 00:43:10.905
and they feel good about themselves,

1008
00:43:10.905 --> 00:43:12.485
and they want America to be a good country.

1009
00:43:12.485 --> 00:43:14.185
Do you think it mattered when that plane

1010
00:43:14.185 --> 00:43:16.025
came through their window?

1011
00:43:16.025 --> 00:43:19.205
We're all headed for serious trouble, and unless everybody

1012
00:43:19.205 --> 00:43:21.065
gets on board and starts taking action,

1013
00:43:21.065 --> 00:43:22.925
they're going to suffer the consequences.

1014
00:43:22.925 --> 00:43:24.545
<v Regina>You're drawing a link between the ET issue</v>

1015
00:43:24.545 --> 00:43:25.765
and the plane going through the window.

1016
00:43:25.765 --> 00:43:27.005
What exactly are you saying?

1017
00:43:27.005 --> 00:43:28.985
I might be obtuse here, but what are you saying?

1018
00:43:28.985 --> 00:43:32.585
<v ->I'm saying that when you spend a half a trillion</v>

1019
00:43:32.585 --> 00:43:36.245
dollars a year, when you build the largest infrastructure

1020
00:43:36.245 --> 00:43:39.307
of security and intelligence the world has ever seen,

1021
00:43:39.307 --> 00:43:41.627
when you've got satellites in space that can monitor

1022
00:43:41.627 --> 00:43:45.568
every communication on the planet that ever goes airborne,

1023
00:43:45.568 --> 00:43:49.729
and you let a bunch of religious fanatics come in and

1024
00:43:49.729 --> 00:43:53.509
attack the Pentagon, and then it's shown that you've made

1025
00:43:53.509 --> 00:43:57.389
so many screw ups in the 10 or 15 years later, alright?

1026
00:43:57.389 --> 00:44:00.289
I'm saying you spent a half a trillion for nothing,

1027
00:44:00.289 --> 00:44:02.189
at best, alright?

1028
00:44:02.189 --> 00:44:05.522
Or worse, as the 911 theorists are now emerging with

1029
00:44:05.522 --> 00:44:08.102
whole counter arguments, there may have been subsets

1030
00:44:08.102 --> 00:44:11.942
of actual venality here, which is saying what?

1031
00:44:11.942 --> 00:44:15.422
What it's saying is that something, as I pointed out,

1032
00:44:15.422 --> 00:44:20.422
is skewing the ability of vast agencies to do their job,

1033
00:44:21.022 --> 00:44:23.202
of intelligence communities to do their job,

1034
00:44:23.202 --> 00:44:26.062
of the military to do its job so that guys with box cutters

1035
00:44:26.062 --> 00:44:30.782
can destroy massive infrastructures and cause us several

1036
00:44:30.782 --> 00:44:32.662
hundred billion dollars in damage and help

1037
00:44:32.662 --> 00:44:35.722
lead us to war supposedly, right?

1038
00:44:35.722 --> 00:44:37.642
It doesn't make sense.

1039
00:44:37.642 --> 00:44:40.442
Just like if you went to a hospital, and you needed to have

1040
00:44:40.442 --> 00:44:45.282
major brain surgery, and they brought in a short order cook

1041
00:44:45.282 --> 00:44:47.562
and said, today we're gonna let the short order cook

1042
00:44:47.562 --> 00:44:49.982
operate on you, you'd wanna know why.

1043
00:44:49.982 --> 00:44:51.962
And we say we can't tell you, because you don't have

1044
00:44:51.962 --> 00:44:53.262
a need to know that.

1045
00:44:53.262 --> 00:44:55.322
And you'd be sitting there going, wow,

1046
00:44:55.322 --> 00:44:57.222
I'm in deep trouble, aren't I?

1047
00:44:57.222 --> 00:44:58.782
When things don't make sense--

1048
00:44:58.782 --> 00:45:00.082
<v Regina>It does seem that we're being run by</v>

1049
00:45:00.082 --> 00:45:01.482
short order cooks, I might say.

1050
00:45:01.482 --> 00:45:03.382
<v ->Yeah, when things don't make sense.</v>

1051
00:45:03.382 --> 00:45:06.722
In other words, Lewis Carroll wrote a great book,

1052
00:45:06.722 --> 00:45:10.442
and it's fun to read, but you don't wanna live it.

1053
00:45:10.442 --> 00:45:12.282
In other words, you just wanna read about

1054
00:45:12.282 --> 00:45:13.642
Alice in Wonderland.

1055
00:45:13.642 --> 00:45:16.062
You don't wanna live Alice in Wonderland,

1056
00:45:16.062 --> 00:45:19.722
'cause we don't live in those times, those pro se times

1057
00:45:19.722 --> 00:45:22.902
in England with those wonderful lawns and the forests

1058
00:45:22.902 --> 00:45:24.782
and following the little rabbit down the hall.

1059
00:45:24.782 --> 00:45:26.582
Uh uh, we don't live in times like that.

1060
00:45:26.582 --> 00:45:29.042
We live in times now when a couple of guys can drive

1061
00:45:29.042 --> 00:45:32.963
a truck into Washington tomorrow and blow it

1062
00:45:32.963 --> 00:45:34.803
to kingdom come.

1063
00:45:34.803 --> 00:45:36.683
And that will move the Capitol to Denver,

1064
00:45:36.683 --> 00:45:39.363
which is why they built the airport there and dug it--

1065
00:45:39.363 --> 00:45:40.503
<v Regina>Down.</v>
down so far because

1066
00:45:40.503 --> 00:45:42.303
the new Capitol is going to be underground.

1067
00:45:42.303 --> 00:45:47.303
You don't want to live in Alice in Wonderland today,

1068
00:45:47.623 --> 00:45:49.243
and we are.

1069
00:45:49.243 --> 00:45:51.623
Alice in Wonderland and the Emperor's New Clothes.

1070
00:45:51.623 --> 00:45:54.423
The government's position is you are so dumb

1071
00:45:54.423 --> 00:45:57.783
that we're gonna tell you WMDs are there when they aren't.

1072
00:45:57.783 --> 00:46:01.023
We're gonna tell you ETs aren't here when they are,

1073
00:46:01.023 --> 00:46:02.463
and you're gonna buy it.

1074
00:46:02.463 --> 00:46:04.163
You're just gonna eat that bologna sandwich

1075
00:46:04.163 --> 00:46:05.903
and wash it down.

1076
00:46:05.903 --> 00:46:07.403
And they actually believe that.

1077
00:46:07.403 --> 00:46:09.803
And by and large that's what's going on.

1078
00:46:09.803 --> 00:46:14.043
Now there is a revolution, there is a force emerging,

1079
00:46:14.043 --> 00:46:16.723
driven by the internet, driven by new money

1080
00:46:16.723 --> 00:46:19.943
to some degree in certain areas, not the ET area yet

1081
00:46:19.943 --> 00:46:21.523
'cause we are an incredibly rich nation.

1082
00:46:21.523 --> 00:46:23.743
We got teenagers worth $20 million dollars.

1083
00:46:23.743 --> 00:46:25.303
That's starting to counter.

1084
00:46:25.303 --> 00:46:26.743
Is it too late?

1085
00:46:26.743 --> 00:46:28.443
History has many examples where people finally go

1086
00:46:28.443 --> 00:46:30.183
(clap) I've had enough of this.

1087
00:46:30.183 --> 00:46:32.143
I'm mad as hell, and I can't take it anymore.

1088
00:46:32.143 --> 00:46:36.803
Like the guy in the FedEx ad, walks out the cave,

1089
00:46:36.803 --> 00:46:38.723
kicks the dinosaur, and then boom!

1090
00:46:38.723 --> 00:46:40.366
Big dinosaur comes down.

1091
00:46:40.366 --> 00:46:41.486
So it is too late?

1092
00:46:41.486 --> 00:46:43.186
We're going out there, we're mad as hell,

1093
00:46:43.186 --> 00:46:44.486
and boom!

1094
00:46:44.486 --> 00:46:47.446
You see, time matters, OK.

1095
00:46:47.446 --> 00:46:52.446
In other words, if the canoe is already gone off the falls,

1096
00:46:52.686 --> 00:46:55.106
and at that point you say, I think we need to start

1097
00:46:55.106 --> 00:46:57.266
paddling in the other direction, you see all that

1098
00:46:57.266 --> 00:46:58.766
good intent isn't going to matter.

1099
00:46:58.766 --> 00:46:59.886
It's too late.

1100
00:46:59.886 --> 00:47:01.006
Is it too late?

1101
00:47:01.006 --> 00:47:06.006
Read the mainstream books on environmental issues

1102
00:47:06.006 --> 00:47:09.286
and the political issues and the terrorist issues.

1103
00:47:09.286 --> 00:47:10.886
Not written by whackos and wingnuts,

1104
00:47:10.886 --> 00:47:13.306
written by people that are trained at Harvard,

1105
00:47:13.306 --> 00:47:16.246
at institutes of politics, and they're talking about

1106
00:47:16.246 --> 00:47:18.706
tipping points in at least four areas of the environment.

1107
00:47:18.706 --> 00:47:19.466
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1108
00:47:19.466 --> 00:47:21.906
<v ->Pick up a Time Magazine where the cover says,</v>

1109
00:47:21.906 --> 00:47:24.526
be afraid, be very afraid.

1110
00:47:24.526 --> 00:47:26.066
Time Magazine.

1111
00:47:26.066 --> 00:47:27.506
I'm not sure we have time.

1112
00:47:27.506 --> 00:47:29.826
It may be it's too late, and we need to just

1113
00:47:29.826 --> 00:47:31.786
steel ourselves for the end.

1114
00:47:31.786 --> 00:47:34.826
On the other hand, I'm not sure we don't have time.

1115
00:47:34.826 --> 00:47:36.286
But I am sure about one thing.

1116
00:47:36.286 --> 00:47:38.646
I'm trying to talk to a lot of people out there that

1117
00:47:38.646 --> 00:47:41.586
have the money and the power to change this tomorrow,

1118
00:47:41.586 --> 00:47:44.286
and they will not act.

1119
00:47:44.286 --> 00:47:47.066
Let's start with Steven Spielberg, who has made

1120
00:47:47.066 --> 00:47:50.546
a billion dollars from the issue of extraterrestrial

1121
00:47:50.546 --> 00:47:54.506
phenomena, and is a legend for trying to influence

1122
00:47:54.506 --> 00:47:58.586
politics with the Shoah Project and with Schindler's List

1123
00:47:58.586 --> 00:48:03.586
and ET and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

1124
00:48:03.886 --> 00:48:05.266
<v Regina>That other series he did for SciFi.</v>

1125
00:48:05.266 --> 00:48:07.006
<v ->When he was confronted by a Hollywood reporter,</v>

1126
00:48:07.006 --> 00:48:09.306
what do you really think about this ET issue?

1127
00:48:09.306 --> 00:48:12.106
This was after the Taken miniseries was broadcast,

1128
00:48:12.106 --> 00:48:13.566
<v Regina>That's right.</v>
<v ->He backed off.</v>

1129
00:48:13.566 --> 00:48:15.686
Is he getting threatening phone calls in the

1130
00:48:15.686 --> 00:48:16.706
middle of the night?

1131
00:48:16.706 --> 00:48:17.946
We know they take place.

1132
00:48:17.946 --> 00:48:19.546
You are worth a billion dollars, you got a beautiful wife

1133
00:48:19.546 --> 00:48:22.906
and five kids, and your life is perfect.

1134
00:48:22.906 --> 00:48:25.206
And you get a call on your private line that nobody

1135
00:48:25.206 --> 00:48:26.826
has the number except your closest friend,

1136
00:48:26.826 --> 00:48:29.466
and somebody with a very military government sounding

1137
00:48:29.466 --> 00:48:33.046
voice says look, make your movies, make your billion,

1138
00:48:33.046 --> 00:48:35.186
enjoy your wife and your kids, but if you're gonna engage

1139
00:48:35.186 --> 00:48:37.486
the ET issue with money or open your mouth,

1140
00:48:37.486 --> 00:48:39.266
we're gonna take you down.

1141
00:48:39.266 --> 00:48:40.366
<v Regina>And it does happen.</v>

1142
00:48:40.366 --> 00:48:44.986
<v ->That's why generally in our society, or in most societies,</v>

1143
00:48:44.986 --> 00:48:47.526
the great changes come from people who don't have

1144
00:48:47.526 --> 00:48:48.686
much to lose.

1145
00:48:48.686 --> 00:48:50.946
It's the people that when they get that phone call,

1146
00:48:50.946 --> 00:48:54.226
they tell the government to go screw itself because

1147
00:48:54.226 --> 00:48:55.626
they don't have anything to lose.

1148
00:48:55.626 --> 00:48:57.986
The trouble is people like that have no money,

1149
00:48:57.986 --> 00:49:02.646
they're limited, they suffer, it's tough, alright?

1150
00:49:02.646 --> 00:49:07.646
So the message is if you want you can be an American, right?

1151
00:49:08.146 --> 00:49:13.146
Being American is pursuing happiness, right?

1152
00:49:13.566 --> 00:49:18.126
Life and liberty, life come next, liberty comes last.

1153
00:49:18.126 --> 00:49:21.846
Americans should be liberty first, right?

1154
00:49:21.846 --> 00:49:24.586
Life second, pursue happiness last.

1155
00:49:24.586 --> 00:49:26.106
We've sort of got it backwards.

1156
00:49:26.106 --> 00:49:27.566
Now I don't wanna pick on Steven Spielberg.

1157
00:49:27.566 --> 00:49:30.046
I pick on a lot of other people, alright?

1158
00:49:30.046 --> 00:49:32.420
But until people who have made hundreds of millions

1159
00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:35.820
of dollars from this issue put some of that money into

1160
00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:38.380
resolving this issue and ending the political impasse,

1161
00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:39.540
and ending this truth embargo,

1162
00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:41.800
all they are is rich and happy.

1163
00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.140
And history will look back and say, wow,

1164
00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:45.540
you could have done something about it,

1165
00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:49.760
and you sat on your butt because you were just too happy.

1166
00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:51.320
It's not gonna go well.

1167
00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:53.580
They're gonna forget about the movies they've made.

1168
00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:56.080
They're gonna forget about their great cars

1169
00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:59.040
and their penthouse apartments, and all they'll remember is

1170
00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:02.380
the people that had the ability to fund and engage

1171
00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:06.260
this issue chose not to do so, and left the fate of

1172
00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.820
the country and the planet in the hands of old

1173
00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:10.732
paradigm militarists.

1174
00:50:11.662 --> 00:50:14.162
Well, I don't wanna have to answer for that.

1175
00:50:14.162 --> 00:50:17.802
I don't have anything, so I have nothing to lose.

1176
00:50:17.802 --> 00:50:19.772
And I'm not afraid of the government, and there's not

1177
00:50:19.772 --> 00:50:21.472
a damn thing they can do to me that concerns me

1178
00:50:21.472 --> 00:50:22.812
in the slightest.

1179
00:50:22.812 --> 00:50:27.012
I need more people like Steven Greer and others who are

1180
00:50:27.012 --> 00:50:29.892
prepared to risk everything on this issue.

1181
00:50:29.892 --> 00:50:31.374
<v Regina>And Steven Greer had a lot to lose.</v>

1182
00:50:31.374 --> 00:50:32.354
<v ->Has risked plenty.</v>

1183
00:50:32.354 --> 00:50:33.854
<v Regina>He had a lot to lose, he had a wife,</v>

1184
00:50:33.854 --> 00:50:35.414
he has four daughters--
<v ->He's been harassed,</v>

1185
00:50:35.414 --> 00:50:37.534
he was a doctor--
<v ->badgered, two melanomas,</v>

1186
00:50:37.534 --> 00:50:39.194
that's right.
<v ->he's gone through hell.</v>

1187
00:50:39.194 --> 00:50:41.594
He had resources because he was wise enough

1188
00:50:41.594 --> 00:50:45.234
to buy Astro real estate early, but he sacrificed plenty.

1189
00:50:45.234 --> 00:50:46.634
I know others that have sacrificed.

1190
00:50:46.634 --> 00:50:48.594
I know people that have lost their life, their marriages,

1191
00:50:48.594 --> 00:50:50.254
their health and their money.

1192
00:50:50.254 --> 00:50:51.234
<v Regina>Trying to reveal this.</v>

1193
00:50:51.234 --> 00:50:53.316
<v ->And others, and I'm not, let me tell you something.</v>

1194
00:50:53.316 --> 00:50:56.916
I'm particularly irritated with people who have

1195
00:50:56.916 --> 00:50:59.576
made money off of the issue.

1196
00:50:59.576 --> 00:51:01.156
In other words, if you make a billion dollars over here

1197
00:51:01.156 --> 00:51:03.236
selling computers or something,

1198
00:51:03.236 --> 00:51:04.837
you may not even know about it.

1199
00:51:04.837 --> 00:51:08.017
But if you've made money off of it, if you've sold tickets

1200
00:51:08.017 --> 00:51:11.857
to these movies on ETs and so forth, and series,

1201
00:51:11.857 --> 00:51:13.337
and you've made science fiction books,

1202
00:51:13.337 --> 00:51:16.197
and you've made money from the interest that's emerging

1203
00:51:16.197 --> 00:51:18.597
naturally out of the fact the ETs are all over the place,

1204
00:51:18.597 --> 00:51:21.077
but when it comes to addressing the issue say,

1205
00:51:21.077 --> 00:51:23.477
well, I'm just here to make money, I don't need to do that.

1206
00:51:23.477 --> 00:51:26.257
But then you try to pass yourself off as being high minded

1207
00:51:26.257 --> 00:51:28.537
and socially conscious and politically engaging,

1208
00:51:28.537 --> 00:51:30.977
but not on this issue, this is too tough.

1209
00:51:30.977 --> 00:51:33.497
<v Regina>Well, it is tough if you have that kind of</v>

1210
00:51:33.497 --> 00:51:36.157
pressure on you, and interestingly, this is not an issue

1211
00:51:36.157 --> 00:51:38.497
that is new, that didn't start in the 1940's.

1212
00:51:38.497 --> 00:51:40.557
History is laden with it.

1213
00:51:40.557 --> 00:51:42.577
Cave drawings have it.
<v ->Oh yeah, sure, yeah.</v>

1214
00:51:42.577 --> 00:51:44.617
<v Regina>Renaissance art has it.</v>

1215
00:51:44.617 --> 00:51:47.977
There's a fabulous website that shows ET art

1216
00:51:47.977 --> 00:51:50.217
throughout history, and some of it's comical

1217
00:51:50.217 --> 00:51:55.217
like the famous one with Mary, the Virgin Mary

1218
00:51:55.237 --> 00:51:57.217
with ETs floating around her head from,

1219
00:51:57.217 --> 00:51:58.357
when was that done?

1220
00:51:58.357 --> 00:51:59.677
Sixteen hundred, something like that.

1221
00:51:59.677 --> 00:52:00.857
<v ->I love that stuff.</v>

1222
00:52:00.857 --> 00:52:03.377
<v Regina>I do, too, but the point is this isn't new.</v>

1223
00:52:03.377 --> 00:52:06.237
It seems as though, because it was represented that

1224
00:52:06.237 --> 00:52:07.517
it was somehow accepted.

1225
00:52:07.517 --> 00:52:09.877
The presence of these other beings was accepted

1226
00:52:09.877 --> 00:52:11.017
throughout history.

1227
00:52:11.017 --> 00:52:13.277
Capsicola, there are many, many legends about

1228
00:52:13.277 --> 00:52:15.917
the beings who came, helped teach about irrigation,

1229
00:52:15.917 --> 00:52:17.297
growing crops, etc.

1230
00:52:17.297 --> 00:52:19.417
They've always been here.

1231
00:52:19.417 --> 00:52:21.997
It's only now that we have the suppression,

1232
00:52:21.997 --> 00:52:24.417
the cover up, and now going in to the anxiety and

1233
00:52:24.417 --> 00:52:29.337
real fears of it is even adding insult to injury on it.

1234
00:52:29.337 --> 00:52:30.937
<v ->Oh, there's always been a cover up.</v>

1235
00:52:30.937 --> 00:52:32.717
ETs have always been here for a long time,

1236
00:52:32.717 --> 00:52:33.837
that's not new.

1237
00:52:33.837 --> 00:52:34.697
There's always been a cover up.

1238
00:52:34.697 --> 00:52:37.117
The church has covered this up absolutely.

1239
00:52:37.117 --> 00:52:38.617
<v Regina>They've tried, the artists still got it out.</v>

1240
00:52:38.617 --> 00:52:40.617
<v ->OK, and in fact, if you wanna read a fascinating book,</v>

1241
00:52:40.617 --> 00:52:44.737
it's a classic written by a man who wrote under a pen name,

1242
00:52:44.737 --> 00:52:48.137
and it's Gods of Eden by William Bramley.

1243
00:52:48.137 --> 00:52:50.357
Powerful book written a good while ago.

1244
00:52:50.357 --> 00:52:55.357
It was written in 1990, 16 years ago, but boy is it strong.

1245
00:52:56.290 --> 00:52:58.391
No, the ET presence is not new.

1246
00:52:58.391 --> 00:52:59.951
Cover up is definitely not new.

1247
00:52:59.951 --> 00:53:02.251
It goes back to ancient times.

1248
00:53:02.251 --> 00:53:07.251
What is new, alright, why are they all over the place?

1249
00:53:07.271 --> 00:53:10.451
Why are we getting all this information now?

1250
00:53:10.451 --> 00:53:13.071
They have the ability to obscure themselves much more.

1251
00:53:13.071 --> 00:53:17.871
Why are they not taking greater efforts to not be seen?

1252
00:53:17.871 --> 00:53:19.311
That's new.

1253
00:53:19.311 --> 00:53:21.291
They're driving some sort of a process.

1254
00:53:21.291 --> 00:53:24.751
And I hope it's the process I think it is.

1255
00:53:24.751 --> 00:53:27.471
I hope they're driving a self disclosure process down here

1256
00:53:27.471 --> 00:53:31.311
so that we can honor our social contracts,

1257
00:53:31.311 --> 00:53:33.191
which is an important concept which more people

1258
00:53:33.191 --> 00:53:34.671
need to know about and learn in school,

1259
00:53:34.671 --> 00:53:36.731
if they're learning anything in school anymore.

1260
00:53:36.731 --> 00:53:39.351
Every nation, the people of every nation of society

1261
00:53:39.351 --> 00:53:41.231
have a social contract with their government,

1262
00:53:41.231 --> 00:53:44.591
and the honoring of that contract is what makes things work.

1263
00:53:44.591 --> 00:53:47.371
And when those contracts get broken, it's not good.

1264
00:53:47.371 --> 00:53:49.271
Somalia, the contract was broken.

1265
00:53:49.271 --> 00:53:50.451
Just go see Blackhawk Down.

1266
00:53:50.451 --> 00:53:52.231
You'll know what I'm talking about.

1267
00:53:52.231 --> 00:53:55.111
Self disclosure honors the contract.

1268
00:53:55.111 --> 00:53:57.871
We take four or five years to absorb the information,

1269
00:53:57.871 --> 00:54:00.611
which is in abundance once the press takes the

1270
00:54:00.611 --> 00:54:02.511
paper bag off their head.

1271
00:54:02.511 --> 00:54:04.371
And by the way, the academia, don't let me let them

1272
00:54:04.371 --> 00:54:05.491
off the hook.

1273
00:54:05.491 --> 00:54:07.211
<v Regina>No no, you don't even have to go there.</v>

1274
00:54:07.211 --> 00:54:08.391
We know about that.

1275
00:54:08.391 --> 00:54:10.451
<v ->Boy would I like to kick some academic butt.</v>

1276
00:54:10.451 --> 00:54:12.531
But the point is that once the paper bags were taken

1277
00:54:12.531 --> 00:54:13.891
off their heads and they come out of the closet

1278
00:54:13.891 --> 00:54:17.311
and all that stuff, there's plenty of information.

1279
00:54:17.311 --> 00:54:22.311
So the issue is what's really new?

1280
00:54:25.692 --> 00:54:29.272
I think what's new is it's bar mitzvah time.

1281
00:54:29.272 --> 00:54:32.172
In other words, the planet is about to come of age,

1282
00:54:32.172 --> 00:54:36.252
and we're going to be acknowledged formally by them,

1283
00:54:36.252 --> 00:54:37.733
and we're gonna acknowledge them formally.

1284
00:54:37.733 --> 00:54:39.753
We're gonna have formal contact, but that needs to happen

1285
00:54:39.753 --> 00:54:41.713
after the self disclosure process.

1286
00:54:41.713 --> 00:54:44.553
If an independent scenario, an independent state scenario

1287
00:54:44.553 --> 00:54:46.213
were to take place where they parked a saucer,

1288
00:54:46.213 --> 00:54:47.993
a mother ship over every city,

1289
00:54:47.993 --> 00:54:50.555
they don't have to destroy anything, but let me tell you,

1290
00:54:50.555 --> 00:54:53.435
breaks every social contract because at that moment

1291
00:54:53.435 --> 00:54:55.335
the people are saying you didn't tell us about

1292
00:54:55.335 --> 00:54:57.615
that mother ship, and it's there now,

1293
00:54:57.615 --> 00:55:00.995
and so consequently my deal with you is over, alright?

1294
00:55:00.995 --> 00:55:01.995
That's bad.

1295
00:55:01.995 --> 00:55:05.475
But on the other hand, if the nations of the world finally

1296
00:55:05.475 --> 00:55:06.775
acknowledge to their citizens, yeah,

1297
00:55:06.775 --> 00:55:08.555
there's extraterrestrials here, and this is what we know,

1298
00:55:08.555 --> 00:55:09.995
and you know, don't panic.

1299
00:55:09.995 --> 00:55:11.775
Then five years later after digesting that

1300
00:55:11.775 --> 00:55:13.335
they show up, it's like--

1301
00:55:13.335 --> 00:55:15.635
<v Regina>Fine, let's talk.</v>
<v ->hey, glad to see ya.</v>

1302
00:55:15.635 --> 00:55:19.855
This I believe is what is happening, but I would never

1303
00:55:19.855 --> 00:55:22.255
tell somebody OK, and therefore this is what

1304
00:55:22.255 --> 00:55:23.315
you need to act on.

1305
00:55:23.315 --> 00:55:25.915
I'm saying this is one possibility, I believe it,

1306
00:55:25.915 --> 00:55:28.715
there are others, pay attention, get involved.

1307
00:55:28.715 --> 00:55:30.275
<v Regina>The point is it should be disclosed.</v>

1308
00:55:30.275 --> 00:55:31.095
<v ->Oh, god.</v>

1309
00:55:31.095 --> 00:55:32.015
<v Regina>It should be disclosed.</v>

1310
00:55:32.015 --> 00:55:32.915
The bottom line is this.

1311
00:55:32.915 --> 00:55:34.335
I agree with you, I think that is the scenario,

1312
00:55:34.335 --> 00:55:36.955
and I agree that it should be disclosed.

1313
00:55:36.955 --> 00:55:39.015
And you are doing everything in your power to see that

1314
00:55:39.015 --> 00:55:42.957
that happens long after the May of 2001 event,

1315
00:55:42.957 --> 00:55:44.555
and I totally applaud you.

1316
00:55:44.555 --> 00:55:46.177
And I know how angry you are because I know

1317
00:55:46.177 --> 00:55:47.877
the obstacles you've been up against,

1318
00:55:47.877 --> 00:55:50.037
which is why I wanted to talk to you today and help

1319
00:55:50.037 --> 00:55:51.577
bring some light to this subject.

1320
00:55:51.577 --> 00:55:53.277
So you go, guy.

1321
00:55:53.277 --> 00:55:54.357
(laughing)

1322
00:55:54.357 --> 00:55:56.337
<v ->Thank you, thank you, and let's talk again because</v>

1323
00:55:56.337 --> 00:55:58.137
you know, I tend to ramble.

1324
00:55:58.137 --> 00:56:00.217
<v Regina>No.</v>
<v ->And I tend to aside--</v>

1325
00:56:00.217 --> 00:56:01.637
<v Regina>But it's interesting.</v>

1326
00:56:01.637 --> 00:56:04.717
and ad lib, and really we have only scratched the surface.

1327
00:56:04.717 --> 00:56:05.897
<v Regina>That's true.</v>

1328
00:56:05.897 --> 00:56:09.297
<v ->The political implications that are involved,</v>

1329
00:56:09.297 --> 00:56:11.517
and the political stuff that's happening now with

1330
00:56:11.517 --> 00:56:13.237
Paul Halyer and so many other things,

1331
00:56:13.237 --> 00:56:14.557
we could spend several more shows.

1332
00:56:14.557 --> 00:56:15.657
So let's do another show.

1333
00:56:15.657 --> 00:56:16.517
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1334
00:56:16.517 --> 00:56:19.077
<v ->Let's make sure that your viewers have at least</v>

1335
00:56:19.077 --> 00:56:21.617
a base understanding of the political process

1336
00:56:21.617 --> 00:56:25.017
which is gonna lead to the disclosure event, right?

1337
00:56:25.017 --> 00:56:26.697
Which will come on 'em fast, right?

1338
00:56:26.697 --> 00:56:28.417
There won't be a lot of pre announcements,

1339
00:56:28.417 --> 00:56:29.977
and there'll be no engraved invitations.

1340
00:56:29.977 --> 00:56:32.378
So that they can make a decision.

1341
00:56:32.378 --> 00:56:34.058
And if you wanna be crass about it,

1342
00:56:34.058 --> 00:56:35.818
let me make it real clear, right?

1343
00:56:35.818 --> 00:56:37.278
Particularly to those people out there that have a

1344
00:56:37.278 --> 00:56:39.498
great deal of wealth that I wish they'd give some to me,

1345
00:56:39.498 --> 00:56:40.898
so I'm gonna give you a tip that could save you

1346
00:56:40.898 --> 00:56:42.118
a lotta money.

1347
00:56:42.118 --> 00:56:43.658
If the government announces the presence of

1348
00:56:43.658 --> 00:56:46.788
extraterrestrials on Monday, you had better be

1349
00:56:46.788 --> 00:56:49.418
short oil and long gold.

1350
00:56:49.418 --> 00:56:52.078
If you are short gold and long oil,

1351
00:56:52.078 --> 00:56:54.638
you're going to lose a lotta money, right.

1352
00:56:54.638 --> 00:56:57.418
All of this is real, it has real consequences.

1353
00:56:57.418 --> 00:56:59.798
We can stand down at our own peril.

1354
00:56:59.798 --> 00:57:02.678
Let's engage it politically, economically,

1355
00:57:02.678 --> 00:57:04.238
socially, spiritually.

1356
00:57:04.238 --> 00:57:05.678
Let's have a good time.

1357
00:57:05.678 --> 00:57:07.478
I guarantee you it's superior to the stuff we're

1358
00:57:07.478 --> 00:57:09.878
engaging right now, alright?

1359
00:57:09.878 --> 00:57:11.988
We can only go up from here.

1360
00:57:15.158 --> 00:57:17.358
<v ->If you'd like to know more about disclosure,</v>

1361
00:57:17.358 --> 00:57:19.998
both in terms of history and what can be done now,

1362
00:57:19.998 --> 00:57:22.478
please go to Stephen's website listed below.

1363
00:57:22.478 --> 00:57:25.398
This is a subject of great importance, and in my opinion,

1364
00:57:25.398 --> 00:57:27.858
our governments have no right to withhold this knowledge

1365
00:57:27.858 --> 00:57:29.738
from us any longer.

1366
00:57:29.738 --> 00:57:32.768
Until next time, thanks for watching.

1367
00:57:34.238 --> 00:57:37.608
(jazzy title music)
