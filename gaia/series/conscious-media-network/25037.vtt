1
00:00:00.786 --> 00:00:02.420
<v ->It's been nearly five years since we've seen</v>

2
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.492
Dolores Cannon, and we wanted to catch up

3
00:00:04.492 --> 00:00:06.931
on the new messages coming through her thousands

4
00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:09.360
of hypnotherapy clients regarding the changes

5
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.196
that are in motion for humanity,

6
00:00:11.196 --> 00:00:13.831
specifically our evolution as a species.

7
00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:15.569
What she's being told is that we have two

8
00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:18.237
distinctly different outcomes ahead depending

9
00:00:18.237 --> 00:00:22.056
on how we choose to develop our own vibrations.

10
00:00:30.616 --> 00:00:32.484
It is so good catching up with you again,

11
00:00:32.484 --> 00:00:34.153
because the story and the work you've done

12
00:00:34.153 --> 00:00:36.822
has progressed quite a lot in the last few years.

13
00:00:36.822 --> 00:00:38.022
You have some new books out,

14
00:00:38.022 --> 00:00:40.392
You've regressed many, many more people.

15
00:00:40.392 --> 00:00:43.895
And what I love about what you're doing is this,

16
00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:48.895
this mosaic of individual experiences that is creating

17
00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:52.303
a larger picture of where we're headed as a species.

18
00:00:52.303 --> 00:00:54.506
And where the Earth is headed itself.

19
00:00:54.506 --> 00:00:57.110
And Dolores, what I'd like to start with is this whole notion

20
00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.277
of first the volunteer souls that have come for this time.

21
00:01:00.277 --> 00:01:02.996
And then start working through the wave one, two,

22
00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:05.350
and three people that have been born their jobs,

23
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.486
and how they're executing it and what their source is.

24
00:01:08.486 --> 00:01:10.622
<v ->Okay, because since we worked together,</v>

25
00:01:10.622 --> 00:01:13.592
I've done a lot more work and gone into a whole different

26
00:01:13.592 --> 00:01:16.328
direction than I was before.

27
00:01:16.328 --> 00:01:19.064
And a lot of it is focusing on the new earth

28
00:01:19.064 --> 00:01:21.506
that we're moving into in these times right now

29
00:01:21.506 --> 00:01:25.237
with the changing of the vibrations and the frequencies.

30
00:01:25.237 --> 00:01:26.705
That everything is different.

31
00:01:26.705 --> 00:01:30.275
This is a very exciting time to be alive.

32
00:01:30.275 --> 00:01:32.944
But that's one thing that people want me to talk about

33
00:01:32.944 --> 00:01:35.680
is the three waves of volunteers.

34
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.383
We get thousands of e-mails now since I've done

35
00:01:38.383 --> 00:01:41.254
Coast to Coast and Project Camelot saying,

36
00:01:41.254 --> 00:01:44.489
I know I am first wave, I am second wave.

37
00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:46.825
They're identifying with it because they said

38
00:01:46.825 --> 00:01:50.128
for the first time it makes sense to them.

39
00:01:50.128 --> 00:01:52.964
Their whole life they have felt something wasn't right.

40
00:01:52.964 --> 00:01:56.401
And now it begins to make sense as we start giving

41
00:01:56.401 --> 00:01:59.438
the oh, what do I want to call, not the symptoms,

42
00:01:59.438 --> 00:02:02.775
but the characteristics of the three waves.

43
00:02:02.775 --> 00:02:04.943
But to know about the three waves,

44
00:02:04.943 --> 00:02:07.812
I'm not going to have time to go back

45
00:02:07.812 --> 00:02:09.313
to the whole beginning,

46
00:02:09.313 --> 00:02:12.717
but it has to do with the ETs and the way they have

47
00:02:12.717 --> 00:02:15.258
watched over the earth since it was created,

48
00:02:15.258 --> 00:02:17.556
because they're the ones that created us.

49
00:02:17.556 --> 00:02:20.959
And the ceding of the planet Earth.

50
00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.428
And they've been there all through Earth's history

51
00:02:23.428 --> 00:02:26.398
watching us and taking care of us.

52
00:02:26.398 --> 00:02:30.202
And whenever something was needed in our timeline,

53
00:02:30.202 --> 00:02:31.670
they would supply it.

54
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.509
Like whenever we needed fire, we learned about agriculture.

55
00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.810
All of this was brought in at those times.

56
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.213
And every time something is supposed to be

57
00:02:41.213 --> 00:02:44.282
in our timeline, a new invention or something,

58
00:02:44.282 --> 00:02:47.819
they help it to get here.

59
00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.654
And in the old days they were thought of

60
00:02:49.654 --> 00:02:51.455
as gods and goddesses because they lived

61
00:02:51.455 --> 00:02:53.391
among the people to teach them

62
00:02:53.391 --> 00:02:55.260
what they were supposed to do.

63
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.763
Now they can't do it, so that whenever something is needed,

64
00:02:58.763 --> 00:03:02.435
a new idea, a new invention, that has to be in our timeline,

65
00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:05.270
it is put into the atmosphere.

66
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.642
And then whoever invents it gets it.

67
00:03:07.642 --> 00:03:09.440
they don't care who does.

68
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.409
And you know there are many people all over the world

69
00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.346
working on the same invention at the same time.

70
00:03:14.346 --> 00:03:17.382
Well, this was going along rather smoothly

71
00:03:17.382 --> 00:03:20.852
because they said a lot of times

72
00:03:20.852 --> 00:03:22.721
they would give us something and we'd turn around

73
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:25.823
and use it for the wrong reason.

74
00:03:25.823 --> 00:03:29.094
And you've got to remember, this was the planet.

75
00:03:29.094 --> 00:03:31.363
They said give this beautiful planet a creature

76
00:03:31.363 --> 00:03:33.965
with intelligence and free will

77
00:03:33.965 --> 00:03:36.403
and see what they do with it.

78
00:03:36.403 --> 00:03:39.104
So that's what they've been allowing us to do, these things.

79
00:03:39.104 --> 00:03:40.171
<v Regina>The grand experiment.</v>

80
00:03:40.171 --> 00:03:42.940
<v ->And the prime directive is the one on Star Trek</v>

81
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.743
of non-interference.

82
00:03:44.743 --> 00:03:46.745
You cannot interfere with the development

83
00:03:46.745 --> 00:03:49.047
of a civilization.

84
00:03:49.047 --> 00:03:52.016
So they've been watching us and observing us.

85
00:03:52.016 --> 00:03:54.319
And every time they would give us something,

86
00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.388
we'd turn it into a weapon or something like that.

87
00:03:57.388 --> 00:04:00.559
And I asked them one time isn't that interference

88
00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:05.063
to give us fire, give us agriculture.

89
00:04:05.063 --> 00:04:07.565
And they said no, because that is a gift

90
00:04:07.565 --> 00:04:11.736
we give you at one time at your point of development.

91
00:04:11.736 --> 00:04:14.939
And then what you do with it is free will.

92
00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.008
If we turn it around and use it negative,

93
00:04:17.008 --> 00:04:19.311
that's our free will to do that.

94
00:04:19.311 --> 00:04:21.112
And I said, well can't you come back and tell them

95
00:04:21.112 --> 00:04:23.148
they're doing it wrong?

96
00:04:23.148 --> 00:04:26.251
They said no, because that is interference.

97
00:04:26.251 --> 00:04:27.918
That's what's not allowed.

98
00:04:27.918 --> 00:04:30.556
So this brings us up to the three waves

99
00:04:30.556 --> 00:04:33.392
because at the end of World War II,

100
00:04:33.392 --> 00:04:36.027
when we dropped the atomic bomb,

101
00:04:36.027 --> 00:04:38.430
really got their attention.

102
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.765
And if you remember, at the end of World War II

103
00:04:40.765 --> 00:04:43.801
is when the big UFO flap began.

104
00:04:43.801 --> 00:04:46.205
<v Regina>Yes, and then the response to it</v>

105
00:04:46.205 --> 00:04:49.808
in 1947, Project Bluebook, all these different responses.

106
00:04:49.808 --> 00:04:51.509
<v ->It started at the end of the war.</v>

107
00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:52.543
<v Regina>Yes, the NSA.</v>

108
00:04:52.543 --> 00:04:55.983
<v ->Because they were observing up until then,</v>

109
00:04:55.983 --> 00:04:56.983
shaking their heads,

110
00:04:56.983 --> 00:04:59.718
here we go through this awful World War II.

111
00:04:59.718 --> 00:05:02.888
But it was like, we still had to let us keep doing

112
00:05:02.888 --> 00:05:04.289
what we were doing.

113
00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.158
But then we dropped the atomic bomb

114
00:05:06.158 --> 00:05:07.625
and they got down here.

115
00:05:07.625 --> 00:05:10.228
They said, we'd better see what these kids are up to

116
00:05:10.228 --> 00:05:13.398
because they should not have had this power yet.

117
00:05:13.398 --> 00:05:16.100
It was not supposed to be given to us until

118
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.172
we could use it in the right way.

119
00:05:18.172 --> 00:05:20.505
It was supposed to be used positive.

120
00:05:20.505 --> 00:05:22.874
Instead, when it was invented it was invented

121
00:05:22.874 --> 00:05:25.443
as negative for a weapon.

122
00:05:25.443 --> 00:05:28.379
It will never have the energy it was supposed to have

123
00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:30.682
because of that.

124
00:05:30.682 --> 00:05:32.249
It was supposed to be positive.

125
00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:34.059
<v Regina>Well, could a positive use have been</v>

126
00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:37.556
the proper use of it for an energy supply, for example?

127
00:05:37.556 --> 00:05:39.592
For nuclear energy supplies around the planet.

128
00:05:39.592 --> 00:05:41.261
<v ->That's what it was supposed to be.</v>

129
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:43.196
But we weren't ready yet to have it,

130
00:05:43.196 --> 00:05:45.333
because they knew what we would do with it.

131
00:05:45.333 --> 00:05:48.733
So we got it too soon.

132
00:05:48.733 --> 00:05:50.802
So that's what they were worried about.

133
00:05:50.802 --> 00:05:53.805
Now with the prime directive, the only time

134
00:05:53.805 --> 00:05:57.108
they could really interfere with a civilization

135
00:05:57.108 --> 00:05:59.210
is if it gets to the point that we're going

136
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.911
to blow up the world.

137
00:06:00.911 --> 00:06:03.247
If that happens they would have to step in.

138
00:06:03.247 --> 00:06:05.319
Because if we were to blow up the world

139
00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:09.120
it would send reverberations not only through our planet,

140
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.156
but through the whole solar system,

141
00:06:11.156 --> 00:06:14.459
through the galaxies, and through the universes.

142
00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:16.594
And it would cause tremendous damage.

143
00:06:16.594 --> 00:06:19.296
So you would think one little planet over here

144
00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:22.000
isolated in this part of the solar system

145
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.201
wouldn't be important.

146
00:06:23.201 --> 00:06:24.870
<v Regina>But we have a multi-dimensional earth,</v>

147
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.505
which is would have also impacted the other,

148
00:06:26.505 --> 00:06:28.242
please take a drink.

149
00:06:28.242 --> 00:06:30.441
It would have also impacted the other dimensions

150
00:06:30.441 --> 00:06:33.411
of Earth, and we don't stop to think about that.

151
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:36.513
So the reverberations would have been felt

152
00:06:36.513 --> 00:06:38.950
wide and far if we had succeeded in this.

153
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.952
<v ->They said it would be as though undeclared war</v>

154
00:06:40.952 --> 00:06:43.255
on the other dimensions,

155
00:06:43.255 --> 00:06:46.056
where their other civilizations are existing.

156
00:06:46.056 --> 00:06:47.726
So, something like that happened,

157
00:06:47.726 --> 00:06:50.061
they would have to come in and stop it.

158
00:06:50.061 --> 00:06:52.163
That's the only way they could.

159
00:06:52.163 --> 00:06:56.835
So, when the atomic war, the atomic bomb began,

160
00:06:56.835 --> 00:06:58.937
they were really upset about it because these kids

161
00:06:58.937 --> 00:07:01.877
are not going to know how to handle this.

162
00:07:01.877 --> 00:07:05.376
And they could very well blow up the world with it

163
00:07:05.376 --> 00:07:08.379
because they don't know what to do with it.

164
00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:12.750
There are councils that are over all of these things.

165
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.386
There are rules and regulations.

166
00:07:14.386 --> 00:07:16.888
Nothing is just by happenstance.

167
00:07:16.888 --> 00:07:20.258
Everything has rules and regulations that are put on it.

168
00:07:20.258 --> 00:07:23.861
So they go back to the council and they're telling them

169
00:07:23.861 --> 00:07:25.663
we don't know what we're going to do.

170
00:07:25.663 --> 00:07:27.932
We can't interfere.

171
00:07:27.932 --> 00:07:30.702
It's like, what are we going to do?

172
00:07:30.702 --> 00:07:33.338
They couldn't just come in and say stop this,

173
00:07:33.338 --> 00:07:35.176
because that's interference.

174
00:07:35.176 --> 00:07:38.677
So they said they had a meeting with the council.

175
00:07:38.677 --> 00:07:42.234
And it was like,

176
00:07:42.234 --> 00:07:45.517
we know we can't interfere from the outside.

177
00:07:45.517 --> 00:07:47.419
They came up with this plan that I consider

178
00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:49.420
to be brilliant.

179
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:54.420
They said what if we influence from the inside?

180
00:07:54.659 --> 00:07:57.295
So that was when they made the call went out

181
00:07:57.295 --> 00:08:00.231
for volunteers to come and help Earth.

182
00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:01.432
<v Regina>So this would have been late 40s,</v>

183
00:08:01.432 --> 00:08:03.935
early 50s then, that the first wave.

184
00:08:03.935 --> 00:08:06.504
<v ->Yes, this is where I tried to put dates and years</v>

185
00:08:06.504 --> 00:08:08.172
on the three waves.

186
00:08:08.172 --> 00:08:11.110
My daughter says I might be a little too strict on it

187
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:12.643
because some people tell me they think

188
00:08:12.643 --> 00:08:17.348
they're overlapping the ages that I've come up with.

189
00:08:17.348 --> 00:08:22.348
But it says to send out for volunteers

190
00:08:22.353 --> 00:08:25.924
(coughing) I'm sorry.

191
00:08:25.924 --> 00:08:28.993
Pure souls that have never been to Earth before

192
00:08:28.993 --> 00:08:30.963
have never been contaminated.

193
00:08:30.963 --> 00:08:33.164
See, most of Earth, the souls of Earth

194
00:08:33.164 --> 00:08:35.033
are contaminated with karma.

195
00:08:35.033 --> 00:08:38.670
Many lives, one after the other after the other

196
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:41.706
contaminating with karma have to repeat it

197
00:08:41.706 --> 00:08:43.474
again and again and we're still not working it out.

198
00:08:43.474 --> 00:08:44.542
<v Regina>Not learning.</v>

199
00:08:44.542 --> 00:08:47.783
<v ->We're caught on the wheel of karma.</v>

200
00:08:47.783 --> 00:08:50.381
They knew we weren't going to be able to do it.

201
00:08:50.381 --> 00:08:52.617
We'd just come through this horrible war.

202
00:08:52.617 --> 00:08:54.352
We couldn't take care of ourselves.

203
00:08:54.352 --> 00:08:56.154
We can't take care of our own lives

204
00:08:56.154 --> 00:08:58.189
because of the repeating of karma.

205
00:08:58.189 --> 00:08:59.557
We couldn't do it.

206
00:08:59.557 --> 00:09:01.925
So the volunteers were asked to come

207
00:09:01.925 --> 00:09:04.695
who had never been on Earth before,

208
00:09:04.695 --> 00:09:06.530
never been in a human body.

209
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.403
They were not contaminated,

210
00:09:08.403 --> 00:09:11.603
they were pure souls who were asked to come.

211
00:09:11.603 --> 00:09:14.538
Now in my work, none of the people I work with

212
00:09:14.538 --> 00:09:16.874
know this consciously.

213
00:09:16.874 --> 00:09:19.143
It's only found out whenever we do the sessions,

214
00:09:19.143 --> 00:09:21.045
it all comes out.

215
00:09:21.045 --> 00:09:23.554
Otherwise, they're just confused, troubled people.

216
00:09:23.554 --> 00:09:26.217
They don't know what they're doing here.

217
00:09:26.217 --> 00:09:30.521
But the first wave, the ones I call the first wave,

218
00:09:30.521 --> 00:09:33.324
had the most problem of all.

219
00:09:33.324 --> 00:09:34.792
They were the way showers,

220
00:09:34.792 --> 00:09:37.395
the beginners that had to come in.

221
00:09:37.395 --> 00:09:42.066
When I do sessions now the only time I have people

222
00:09:42.066 --> 00:09:45.503
going into past lives are those who have karma

223
00:09:45.503 --> 00:09:47.471
to be repaid.

224
00:09:47.471 --> 00:09:49.774
They're not going to past lives anymore.

225
00:09:49.774 --> 00:09:53.612
They're either going back to where they were on spaceships,

226
00:09:53.612 --> 00:09:56.514
they were living on other planets,

227
00:09:56.514 --> 00:09:59.650
living in other dimensions, even living as light beings.

228
00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.619
They were highly evolved.

229
00:10:01.619 --> 00:10:05.289
And they volunteered to come and help the Earth.

230
00:10:05.289 --> 00:10:08.760
Or, they go back to the source.

231
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.362
And I have whole sections in my book describing

232
00:10:11.362 --> 00:10:14.265
what everyone says the source is, God.

233
00:10:14.265 --> 00:10:16.601
They all describe it the same way.

234
00:10:16.601 --> 00:10:18.869
These are souls that have never been in any kind

235
00:10:18.869 --> 00:10:20.671
of a body at all.

236
00:10:20.671 --> 00:10:24.542
Can you imagine how traumatic it would be to come

237
00:10:24.542 --> 00:10:29.542
pure from the source into this world now.

238
00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:33.085
<v Regina>Very disturbing, very challenging.</v>

239
00:10:33.085 --> 00:10:34.485
<v ->Many people have done that.</v>

240
00:10:34.485 --> 00:10:37.256
They go back to the source where they are one with God,

241
00:10:37.256 --> 00:10:39.156
where we all began.

242
00:10:39.156 --> 00:10:41.526
People are always asking me, they say in their session,

243
00:10:41.526 --> 00:10:43.764
I want to know where I'm from.

244
00:10:43.764 --> 00:10:46.331
I say we're all from the same place.

245
00:10:46.331 --> 00:10:48.799
And they want to know what about my home?

246
00:10:48.799 --> 00:10:50.835
I said, it's all the same place.

247
00:10:50.835 --> 00:10:53.375
They think of a home planet or something like that.

248
00:10:53.375 --> 00:10:54.744
That's not what it's about.

249
00:10:54.744 --> 00:10:58.909
It's all us, we all came from the source, from God.

250
00:10:58.909 --> 00:11:01.512
And that's where we all began.

251
00:11:01.512 --> 00:11:04.582
And when they are there it is so full of love

252
00:11:04.582 --> 00:11:07.317
and it's all this togetherness

253
00:11:07.317 --> 00:11:09.224
that they don't want to leave.

254
00:11:09.224 --> 00:11:13.891
So in the sessions I ask them, well why did you leave?

255
00:11:13.891 --> 00:11:15.026
It was so beautiful.

256
00:11:15.026 --> 00:11:16.828
I know they left because I'm talking to a body

257
00:11:16.828 --> 00:11:18.963
that's laying on the bed.

258
00:11:18.963 --> 00:11:20.398
Why did you leave?

259
00:11:20.398 --> 00:11:21.934
And they all say the same thing.

260
00:11:21.934 --> 00:11:24.901
We heard the call.

261
00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:28.407
They heard the call that went out even to the other planets

262
00:11:28.407 --> 00:11:31.476
to the space people, and to the ones who had never

263
00:11:31.476 --> 00:11:33.978
been out from the source.

264
00:11:33.978 --> 00:11:36.247
We heard the call, Earth is in trouble.

265
00:11:36.247 --> 00:11:38.315
Will you go and help?

266
00:11:38.315 --> 00:11:41.886
And many of them describe meetings on the spirit side even

267
00:11:41.886 --> 00:11:44.490
where they're saying who wants to go and help?

268
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:48.025
And I had one woman, said and I raised my hand.

269
00:11:48.025 --> 00:11:50.595
And she said, what was I thinking?

270
00:11:50.595 --> 00:11:51.796
<v Regina>There you go.</v>

271
00:11:51.796 --> 00:11:54.765
So here she is, and here many of them are in this story.

272
00:11:54.765 --> 00:11:57.134
So there are these consistencies you're hearing

273
00:11:57.134 --> 00:11:57.868
from this waves.

274
00:11:57.868 --> 00:11:59.874
<v ->I do thousands and thousands of people.</v>

275
00:11:59.874 --> 00:12:03.041
I mean, you get the same story from so many people

276
00:12:03.041 --> 00:12:06.577
I put this all together like a puzzle, bits and pieces.

277
00:12:06.577 --> 00:12:08.648
So the first wave were the ones that had

278
00:12:08.648 --> 00:12:10.614
the most trouble.

279
00:12:10.614 --> 00:12:14.488
I guess you would say they were in their later 50s.

280
00:12:14.488 --> 00:12:16.554
Some were in their 40s.

281
00:12:16.554 --> 00:12:19.624
But some people say they think that early 60s

282
00:12:19.624 --> 00:12:21.392
would fall into the same pattern.

283
00:12:21.392 --> 00:12:23.361
It probably will because that's about how long ago

284
00:12:23.361 --> 00:12:25.996
that we dropped the bomb.

285
00:12:25.996 --> 00:12:30.200
But these are the ones who don't want to be here.

286
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.369
They're very unhappy.

287
00:12:32.369 --> 00:12:34.406
They have good families, they have jobs,

288
00:12:34.406 --> 00:12:37.509
but they don't want to be here, they don't like it.

289
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:38.909
They want to go home.

290
00:12:38.909 --> 00:12:42.380
They don't know where home is, but they know it's not here.

291
00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.683
They don't like the violence, they don't understand it.

292
00:12:45.683 --> 00:12:49.620
Many of these first wavers have tried to commit suicide

293
00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.256
at different points in their lives to get out of here.

294
00:12:52.256 --> 00:12:53.591
<v Regina>I have a question at this point.</v>

295
00:12:53.591 --> 00:12:56.394
If they came in and they went through the traditional thing

296
00:12:56.394 --> 00:12:58.396
that happens when you incarnate here,

297
00:12:58.396 --> 00:13:01.499
which is essentially a case of amnesia,

298
00:13:01.499 --> 00:13:03.168
and they don't understand consciously

299
00:13:03.168 --> 00:13:04.602
what they're doing here,

300
00:13:04.602 --> 00:13:08.372
what are they functionally doing while they're here

301
00:13:08.372 --> 00:13:10.007
to help shift those frequencies

302
00:13:10.007 --> 00:13:13.778
or further this evolutionary process?

303
00:13:13.778 --> 00:13:17.548
<v ->The first wave are just living like everybody else.</v>

304
00:13:17.548 --> 00:13:21.355
It's the second wave that are doing different things.

305
00:13:21.355 --> 00:13:25.155
But the first wave are the ones who don't want to be here.

306
00:13:25.155 --> 00:13:26.691
And they wanted to commit suicide.

307
00:13:26.691 --> 00:13:28.962
They've had a very hard time.

308
00:13:28.962 --> 00:13:32.096
But the second wave I've found would be

309
00:13:32.096 --> 00:13:36.935
in their 20s, 30s, maybe some over into the 40s.

310
00:13:36.935 --> 00:13:38.970
And when I'm doing them,

311
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:43.808
they are called antennas, generators.

312
00:13:43.808 --> 00:13:47.344
They are here just to generate positive energy

313
00:13:47.344 --> 00:13:49.847
to affect everyone else.

314
00:13:49.847 --> 00:13:50.849
<v Regina>Yes, that makes sense.</v>

315
00:13:50.849 --> 00:13:53.317
My son is in that age group, and he and his friends

316
00:13:53.317 --> 00:13:56.921
are just beautiful beings who really do work

317
00:13:56.921 --> 00:14:00.457
toward generating communal friendships

318
00:14:00.457 --> 00:14:02.694
and supporting each other, non-judgement,

319
00:14:02.694 --> 00:14:03.594
it's beautiful.

320
00:14:03.594 --> 00:14:04.963
<v ->Well, they said those kind of people</v>

321
00:14:04.963 --> 00:14:08.232
can walk through a crowded mall or a store

322
00:14:08.232 --> 00:14:12.002
and their energy will affect anyone that is there,

323
00:14:12.002 --> 00:14:13.070
not consciously.

324
00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:14.774
They don't realize what they're doing.

325
00:14:14.774 --> 00:14:17.441
But their energy is supposed to be generated

326
00:14:17.441 --> 00:14:19.711
to affect other people.

327
00:14:19.711 --> 00:14:22.913
And I had people come and say what's my purpose?

328
00:14:22.913 --> 00:14:25.215
What am I supposed to be doing here?

329
00:14:25.215 --> 00:14:27.184
And the second waves, they'll usually say

330
00:14:27.184 --> 00:14:29.492
you're just to be.

331
00:14:29.492 --> 00:14:31.088
And they don't like that when they wake up,

332
00:14:31.088 --> 00:14:33.461
they say but I wanted to be doing something.

333
00:14:33.461 --> 00:14:35.927
All you're supposed to do is just be

334
00:14:35.927 --> 00:14:39.330
and allow the energy to affect other people.

335
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.966
But the irony of it is that a lot of the second wavers

336
00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:46.103
don't like people and they don't want to be around them.

337
00:14:46.103 --> 00:14:48.105
Their energy bothers them.

338
00:14:48.105 --> 00:14:49.974
But they're supposed to be affecting people,

339
00:14:49.974 --> 00:14:51.476
so they stay home.

340
00:14:51.476 --> 00:14:55.646
So they're not doing what they're supposed to be doing.

341
00:14:55.646 --> 00:14:57.681
A lot of the second wavers, some of the first

342
00:14:57.681 --> 00:15:00.117
and the second do get married.

343
00:15:00.117 --> 00:15:03.787
But a lot of them don't want to because it's just.

344
00:15:03.787 --> 00:15:04.688
<v Regina>It's sticky.</v>

345
00:15:04.688 --> 00:15:07.425
<v ->And the second wave especially,</v>

346
00:15:07.425 --> 00:15:10.227
they don't want to have children because they said

347
00:15:10.227 --> 00:15:13.130
having children creates karma

348
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:14.799
and they don't want to make any more karma.

349
00:15:14.799 --> 00:15:16.706
They want to do what they're supposed to do

350
00:15:16.706 --> 00:15:18.368
and get out of here.

351
00:15:18.368 --> 00:15:19.939
They don't want to be stuck here

352
00:15:19.939 --> 00:15:23.107
because if they create karma they're going to have to stay.

353
00:15:23.107 --> 00:15:24.942
So many of them don't want children

354
00:15:24.942 --> 00:15:27.378
and they work from their home, the second wavers do

355
00:15:27.378 --> 00:15:29.246
so they keep away from people.

356
00:15:29.246 --> 00:15:32.082
But they're very gentle, loving people.

357
00:15:32.082 --> 00:15:36.120
And I asked them one time, well why did the first wave

358
00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.022
have such a hard time?

359
00:15:38.022 --> 00:15:40.591
And they said somebody has to be the beginning.

360
00:15:40.591 --> 00:15:44.162
Somebody has to be the one that creates the path,

361
00:15:44.162 --> 00:15:46.697
the way shower.

362
00:15:46.697 --> 00:15:49.301
And they started and then the others,

363
00:15:49.301 --> 00:15:50.634
the second wave followed.

364
00:15:50.634 --> 00:15:53.037
So they had an easier time.

365
00:15:53.037 --> 00:15:54.205
<v Regina>And that makes sense.</v>

366
00:15:54.205 --> 00:15:55.073
<v ->That's the difference.</v>

367
00:15:55.073 --> 00:15:56.607
<v Regina>And now their children are these little,</v>

368
00:15:56.607 --> 00:15:58.642
amazing little three, four, five, six.

369
00:15:58.642 --> 00:15:59.977
<v ->Well, not theirs.</v>

370
00:15:59.977 --> 00:16:01.412
It's just the third wave.

371
00:16:01.412 --> 00:16:02.646
<v Regina>The third wave, yes.</v>

372
00:16:02.646 --> 00:16:04.915
<v ->Because some of them don't want children.</v>

373
00:16:04.915 --> 00:16:07.052
<v Regina>Right, some of them are born to whomever.</v>

374
00:16:07.052 --> 00:16:09.020
But that next one is really interesting.

375
00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.556
<v ->The third wave are the children.</v>

376
00:16:11.556 --> 00:16:14.925
And some of them now are in their teens.

377
00:16:14.925 --> 00:16:16.560
But these are the hope of the world.

378
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.962
They're the gift of the world.

379
00:16:17.962 --> 00:16:21.164
They're here to really make a difference.

380
00:16:23.934 --> 00:16:26.436
Of course, the last thing these children should be doing,

381
00:16:26.436 --> 00:16:29.306
done is put on medicine, medication.

382
00:16:29.306 --> 00:16:31.942
That's the last thing because they are functioning

383
00:16:31.942 --> 00:16:32.943
at a different level.

384
00:16:32.943 --> 00:16:35.779
They have come in with all of their genetics,

385
00:16:35.779 --> 00:16:37.748
everything is in place.

386
00:16:37.748 --> 00:16:41.154
Because they are a totally new species.

387
00:16:41.154 --> 00:16:44.157
And I've spoke at conferences about the new children

388
00:16:44.157 --> 00:16:46.825
where they're trying to educate the educators.

389
00:16:46.825 --> 00:16:49.259
And they have panels of these kids.

390
00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:51.128
And you know, they're always saying well,

391
00:16:51.128 --> 00:16:53.565
they're disruptive in the classrooms,

392
00:16:53.565 --> 00:16:56.100
that's why they have to put them on the medication.

393
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.670
And they've said at the conferences the reason

394
00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:02.772
is they're disruptive is because they're bored.

395
00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:06.143
They say the teacher would ask them for an answer

396
00:17:06.143 --> 00:17:09.146
to a problem, a math problem or something.

397
00:17:09.146 --> 00:17:10.948
They'd tell them the answer.

398
00:17:10.948 --> 00:17:13.819
The teacher wants to know how did you find the answer?

399
00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:15.919
They said I just know it.

400
00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:17.688
And to them that's not enough.

401
00:17:17.688 --> 00:17:20.591
They want them to explain how they came by it.

402
00:17:20.591 --> 00:17:23.528
So that's very aggravating to one of these children.

403
00:17:23.528 --> 00:17:26.364
And another thing they said they go over and over

404
00:17:26.364 --> 00:17:28.999
and over again the same material

405
00:17:28.999 --> 00:17:31.502
when I got it the first time.

406
00:17:31.502 --> 00:17:33.074
So they're bored.

407
00:17:33.074 --> 00:17:36.006
What I was told to tell people,

408
00:17:36.006 --> 00:17:38.242
the teachers and the parents,

409
00:17:38.242 --> 00:17:41.979
is to give these kids challenges.

410
00:17:41.979 --> 00:17:44.548
When the other kids are doing the other stuff,

411
00:17:44.548 --> 00:17:48.118
take these kids aside, maybe give them a special project.

412
00:17:48.118 --> 00:17:50.121
A paper to write or something different

413
00:17:50.121 --> 00:17:53.190
that will challenge their minds.

414
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.125
And they said even if you just give them,

415
00:17:55.125 --> 00:17:57.594
the younger ones something to tear apart

416
00:17:57.594 --> 00:18:01.531
and put back together again, it's giving them a challenge.

417
00:18:01.531 --> 00:18:02.833
<v Regina>So they can use their creativity</v>

418
00:18:02.833 --> 00:18:03.968
and their knowledge.

419
00:18:03.968 --> 00:18:07.404
<v ->Otherwise, they're sitting around, well I'm bored.</v>

420
00:18:07.404 --> 00:18:09.242
I don't want to do this again.

421
00:18:09.242 --> 00:18:11.075
Give them something different

422
00:18:11.075 --> 00:18:13.377
and that's how they should be treated.

423
00:18:13.377 --> 00:18:15.446
And they have a different way of thinking

424
00:18:15.446 --> 00:18:18.715
because they do grasp everything so quickly.

425
00:18:18.715 --> 00:18:19.917
<v Regina>So what are they being,</v>

426
00:18:19.917 --> 00:18:23.588
they've incarnated specifically for helping guide

427
00:18:23.588 --> 00:18:27.491
humanity, not just technologically but in terms

428
00:18:27.491 --> 00:18:31.797
of science in every which way because of their ability

429
00:18:31.797 --> 00:18:32.929
to retain knowledge?

430
00:18:32.929 --> 00:18:35.035
<v ->Like I said, they're the gift of the world.</v>

431
00:18:35.035 --> 00:18:38.469
NOVA had a special, oh it's been a few years ago now.

432
00:18:38.469 --> 00:18:40.771
where some of these kids were 10 years old

433
00:18:40.771 --> 00:18:42.740
and have already graduated from college.

434
00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.108
And some of these have already formed

435
00:18:45.108 --> 00:18:47.711
their own organizations.

436
00:18:47.711 --> 00:18:50.013
And it's interesting that a lot of the organizations

437
00:18:50.013 --> 00:18:52.516
they have founded have to do

438
00:18:52.516 --> 00:18:54.651
with helping the children of the world.

439
00:18:54.651 --> 00:18:56.387
<v Regina>Yes, I'm aware of that.</v>

440
00:18:56.387 --> 00:18:57.988
<v ->So this is where they are going.</v>

441
00:18:57.988 --> 00:18:59.660
<v Regina>So they're going to be much more</v>

442
00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:04.660
giving the gift of not just creating

443
00:19:05.396 --> 00:19:08.365
conscious community again on the planet.

444
00:19:08.365 --> 00:19:10.667
<v ->Getting it back to what it's supposed to be.</v>

445
00:19:10.667 --> 00:19:12.070
<v Regina>Getting it back to what it's supposed to be.</v>

446
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.303
<v ->Because the rest of them were caught</v>

447
00:19:13.303 --> 00:19:14.471
into the wheel of karma.

448
00:19:14.471 --> 00:19:16.574
They don't know how to solve their own problems,

449
00:19:16.574 --> 00:19:18.676
let alone the world's problems.

450
00:19:18.676 --> 00:19:23.548
These people don't have those basic karmic problems.

451
00:19:23.548 --> 00:19:26.584
So they can just go in a different way.

452
00:19:26.584 --> 00:19:29.353
They're putting the world into this new world,

453
00:19:29.353 --> 00:19:31.455
the new earth, because we're headed toward

454
00:19:31.455 --> 00:19:33.023
a wonderful time.

455
00:19:33.023 --> 00:19:34.724
<v Regina>Yes, that's the good news.</v>

456
00:19:34.724 --> 00:19:37.330
<v ->The technology will be used in a wonderful way.</v>

457
00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.831
Many wonderful things are happening.

458
00:19:39.831 --> 00:19:42.233
So these new children have a part in it.

459
00:19:42.233 --> 00:19:44.535
And the first and second waves have a part,

460
00:19:44.535 --> 00:19:46.570
but they had difficulty.

461
00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:48.325
<v Regina>And so from this point forward</v>

462
00:19:48.325 --> 00:19:50.708
it should become much more harmonious

463
00:19:50.708 --> 00:19:53.211
for the beings that are choosing to incarnate

464
00:19:53.211 --> 00:19:56.414
during this period because as you write about,

465
00:19:56.414 --> 00:20:01.085
this period is going to lead us to essentially

466
00:20:01.085 --> 00:20:03.120
parallel earths in a sense.

467
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.656
And this has been, I've heard about this

468
00:20:05.656 --> 00:20:07.591
even from my guides who has told about this

469
00:20:07.591 --> 00:20:08.791
25 years ago.

470
00:20:08.791 --> 00:20:12.263
And there's just very slight variances in how this occurs.

471
00:20:12.263 --> 00:20:14.732
But let's talk about what this portrait

472
00:20:14.732 --> 00:20:17.367
of consciousness is showing as to how this earth

473
00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:19.836
evolves, and what happens to the one that

474
00:20:19.836 --> 00:20:23.173
is plagued with catastrophe and so forth.

475
00:20:23.173 --> 00:20:25.810
<v ->Well, I've gotten a lot of information about it.</v>

476
00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:29.480
I put it in convoluted two and convoluted three

477
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.081
and I'm still getting information.

478
00:20:31.081 --> 00:20:34.184
I'm getting bits and pieces that I didn't know about before

479
00:20:34.184 --> 00:20:36.954
because I've gotten so much information,

480
00:20:36.954 --> 00:20:39.925
but I keep asking more and more questions.

481
00:20:39.925 --> 00:20:42.776
And they said we can't answer all your questions

482
00:20:42.776 --> 00:20:45.732
because we don't know what's going to happen.

483
00:20:45.732 --> 00:20:48.565
This has never happened before in the history

484
00:20:48.565 --> 00:20:52.336
of a universe that an entire planet will shift

485
00:20:52.336 --> 00:20:54.575
into another dimension.

486
00:20:54.575 --> 00:20:56.540
So we don't know what's going to happen.

487
00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.776
And it's the greatest show on Earth.

488
00:20:58.776 --> 00:21:01.712
All the ETs, the other beings are out there

489
00:21:01.712 --> 00:21:06.250
watching to see are we going to be able to pull it off.

490
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.419
<v Regina>And let's talk about what it is.</v>

491
00:21:08.419 --> 00:21:10.688
What we're headed for.

492
00:21:10.688 --> 00:21:14.358
<v ->Okay, but down through Earth's history</v>

493
00:21:14.358 --> 00:21:18.462
we've had many, many civilizations that have come and gone.

494
00:21:18.462 --> 00:21:21.832
We have reached the peak of what they could do.

495
00:21:21.832 --> 00:21:25.136
And then it was usually because of man's greed and power

496
00:21:25.136 --> 00:21:28.609
they had to be destroyed, and they were brought down again.

497
00:21:28.609 --> 00:21:31.909
And every time, the civilizations had to begin over

498
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:35.145
from the very primitive stage, the very bottom.

499
00:21:35.145 --> 00:21:38.615
And it took so much time to build it up again.

500
00:21:38.615 --> 00:21:40.551
This time they said they don't want

501
00:21:40.551 --> 00:21:42.285
to take the time to do that.

502
00:21:42.285 --> 00:21:44.357
We're losing too much.

503
00:21:44.357 --> 00:21:46.691
And the Earth is a living being.

504
00:21:46.691 --> 00:21:49.727
It is going to go into its next incarnation.

505
00:21:49.727 --> 00:21:51.262
It is evolving.

506
00:21:51.262 --> 00:21:53.830
It's going to go whether we go or not.

507
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.399
It doesn't care if it takes the human race with it

508
00:21:56.399 --> 00:21:59.495
because we're like fleas on a dog.

509
00:21:59.495 --> 00:22:03.174
And it would just as soon we all disappeared.

510
00:22:03.174 --> 00:22:06.910
So that's why it's going to do its thing.

511
00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.113
But if we want to go with it we're going to have

512
00:22:09.113 --> 00:22:11.314
to evolve also.

513
00:22:11.314 --> 00:22:14.051
But because it is moving it is evolving,

514
00:22:14.051 --> 00:22:17.353
and the frequencies and vibrations are changing

515
00:22:17.353 --> 00:22:20.924
as it moves into this other dimension.

516
00:22:20.924 --> 00:22:25.763
And there will be, this is there the variances come in.

517
00:22:25.763 --> 00:22:28.364
The answers are different.

518
00:22:28.364 --> 00:22:30.935
That there will be essentially two Earths.

519
00:22:30.935 --> 00:22:33.570
And one is the old Earth.

520
00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:36.273
And some people say is that a physical Earth or not?

521
00:22:36.273 --> 00:22:38.341
I don't know, but it's a division and a shifting

522
00:22:38.341 --> 00:22:42.012
of the energies as it goes into another dimension.

523
00:22:42.012 --> 00:22:46.283
But the old Earth will still exist with all its negativity.

524
00:22:46.283 --> 00:22:50.621
This is where all the catastrophes will be, the wars,

525
00:22:50.621 --> 00:22:53.327
all of those things because they say those people

526
00:22:53.327 --> 00:22:56.526
will stay with what they have created.

527
00:22:56.526 --> 00:23:00.763
And they have created that type of world.

528
00:23:00.763 --> 00:23:04.368
In order for you to go with the Earth,

529
00:23:04.368 --> 00:23:07.037
you have to change your vibrations and frequencies

530
00:23:07.037 --> 00:23:10.040
to shift also.

531
00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.941
But you can't change your vibrations

532
00:23:11.941 --> 00:23:14.377
and frequencies instantly,

533
00:23:14.377 --> 00:23:16.446
it would destroy the human body.

534
00:23:16.446 --> 00:23:18.849
So the ones that are heavy into negativity

535
00:23:18.849 --> 00:23:22.153
they can't shift that fast.

536
00:23:22.153 --> 00:23:25.355
So by the time they catch up they won't be able to.

537
00:23:25.355 --> 00:23:27.657
Their vibrations and frequencies are so low

538
00:23:27.657 --> 00:23:30.061
they will stay with the old Earth.

539
00:23:30.061 --> 00:23:31.261
But they said that doesn't matter,

540
00:23:31.261 --> 00:23:33.867
they'll get there eventually anyway.

541
00:23:33.867 --> 00:23:37.668
<v Regina>This is exactly what was given to me</v>

542
00:23:37.668 --> 00:23:39.403
back in the mid 80s.

543
00:23:39.403 --> 00:23:41.772
And since then has been reinforced that part of it

544
00:23:41.772 --> 00:23:44.410
will also happen through attrition.

545
00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:48.279
As people die out that are still working on certain lessons

546
00:23:48.279 --> 00:23:50.980
they'll be incarnating into the one Earth.

547
00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.217
And those who have advanced themselves

548
00:23:53.217 --> 00:23:55.619
in their frequencies will be incarnating then

549
00:23:55.619 --> 00:23:58.054
to the other Earth as well, to the other one.

550
00:23:58.054 --> 00:24:01.758
However, this whole thing about living through the process

551
00:24:01.758 --> 00:24:04.020
is really the interesting part.

552
00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.797
<v ->Those whose frequencies can't change at all</v>

553
00:24:06.797 --> 00:24:08.870
will simply leave the planet.

554
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:12.771
They will transition because they can't adjust to it.

555
00:24:12.771 --> 00:24:17.771
Now, it is shifting and moving and now time is speeding up.

556
00:24:18.509 --> 00:24:21.845
I found all of this began about 2003.

557
00:24:21.845 --> 00:24:23.380
That's when it began to be obvious

558
00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:26.082
as the shifting was occurring.

559
00:24:26.082 --> 00:24:28.585
And a lot of people don't really know what's going on.

560
00:24:28.585 --> 00:24:30.386
All they know is something is happening

561
00:24:30.386 --> 00:24:33.257
and they're feeling different about it.

562
00:24:33.257 --> 00:24:38.257
As it shifts, your body has to adjust with it

563
00:24:38.729 --> 00:24:40.764
because your frequencies and vibrations

564
00:24:40.764 --> 00:24:43.700
have to match the Earth's as it moves.

565
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.603
The other ones that are into negativity

566
00:24:45.603 --> 00:24:47.437
will stay where they are.

567
00:24:47.437 --> 00:24:50.207
But if you want to move with the old Earth

568
00:24:50.207 --> 00:24:53.777
you're going to have to change your vibration

569
00:24:53.777 --> 00:24:55.713
and frequencies.

570
00:24:55.713 --> 00:24:59.049
There are a lot of physical things happening right now

571
00:24:59.049 --> 00:25:01.351
that people are noticing.

572
00:25:01.351 --> 00:25:03.286
A lot of them go to the doctor's and they say

573
00:25:03.286 --> 00:25:04.889
there's nothing wrong with them.

574
00:25:04.889 --> 00:25:06.624
This is because as I've said,

575
00:25:06.624 --> 00:25:09.025
you can't change your frequency instantly,

576
00:25:09.025 --> 00:25:10.427
it would destroy the body.

577
00:25:10.427 --> 00:25:13.630
It has to be done gradually.

578
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:17.667
You may notice these symptoms for a few days

579
00:25:17.667 --> 00:25:20.304
and then it will go away for a month or so.

580
00:25:20.304 --> 00:25:22.507
And then you'll notice them again.

581
00:25:22.507 --> 00:25:25.209
And there will just be on and off symptoms.

582
00:25:25.209 --> 00:25:26.610
<v Regina>What are some of the most common symptoms?</v>

583
00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:29.264
<v ->That's what I was going.</v>

584
00:25:29.264 --> 00:25:33.854
Because this is the body adjusting to the frequency.

585
00:25:33.854 --> 00:25:35.389
Some of the most common symptoms

586
00:25:35.389 --> 00:25:39.656
are high blood pressure, heart palpitations,

587
00:25:39.656 --> 00:25:44.656
dizziness, depression, body aches and pains

588
00:25:44.694 --> 00:25:49.694
especially in the joints, nausea, headaches.

589
00:25:50.367 --> 00:25:53.537
But the depression and the dizziness is one

590
00:25:53.537 --> 00:25:55.105
that people talked a lot about.

591
00:25:55.105 --> 00:25:58.474
And also the heart palpitations and the high blood pressure.

592
00:25:58.474 --> 00:25:59.509
And they go to the doctor,

593
00:25:59.509 --> 00:26:01.778
the doctor can't find anything wrong.

594
00:26:01.778 --> 00:26:03.986
Of course they're going to put them on pills anyway.

595
00:26:03.986 --> 00:26:06.190
<v Regina>Oh yeah, you're on Lipitor right after that.</v>

596
00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:07.418
<v ->Oh, all of it.</v>

597
00:26:07.418 --> 00:26:08.318
<v Regina>All of it.</v>

598
00:26:08.318 --> 00:26:10.119
<v ->And they said it doesn't do any good</v>

599
00:26:10.119 --> 00:26:11.621
because it's gone in a few days.

600
00:26:11.621 --> 00:26:12.956
And they say if you know what's happening,

601
00:26:12.956 --> 00:26:14.758
you can ride it out.

602
00:26:14.758 --> 00:26:16.829
But the older people are the ones that are going

603
00:26:16.829 --> 00:26:18.595
to have the hardest time.

604
00:26:18.595 --> 00:26:21.698
Because their body has a lot harder time adjusting

605
00:26:21.698 --> 00:26:23.934
to all of these frequencies.

606
00:26:23.934 --> 00:26:26.636
The children, you don't worry about them.

607
00:26:26.636 --> 00:26:28.138
They're coming in with all of their frequencies

608
00:26:28.138 --> 00:26:30.611
already in place, they're already adjusted.

609
00:26:30.611 --> 00:26:34.244
It's the ones in the middle, the second and third waves,

610
00:26:34.244 --> 00:26:38.214
are the ones that are going to notice this the most.

611
00:26:38.214 --> 00:26:40.116
<v Regina>And this requires,</v>

612
00:26:40.116 --> 00:26:42.785
well it requires dietary change in a lot of cases.

613
00:26:42.785 --> 00:26:44.221
<v ->I was going to get to that, too.</v>

614
00:26:44.221 --> 00:26:46.557
<v Regina>Yeah, okay let's talk about it.</v>

615
00:26:46.557 --> 00:26:49.096
<v ->But you can see the physical symptoms</v>

616
00:26:49.096 --> 00:26:50.343
would be disturbing.

617
00:26:50.343 --> 00:26:52.763
And the doctors don't know what it is.

618
00:26:52.763 --> 00:26:56.098
If you understand, you can ride it out a lot easier.

619
00:26:56.098 --> 00:26:58.969
And I always ask in my lectures does anyone notice

620
00:26:58.969 --> 00:27:00.838
their diets are changing?

621
00:27:00.838 --> 00:27:03.207
And they usually say they do.

622
00:27:03.207 --> 00:27:08.207
In order to move, for your body to evolve to go with this,

623
00:27:08.645 --> 00:27:11.248
you have to change your diet.

624
00:27:11.248 --> 00:27:13.016
You can't eat heavy foods.

625
00:27:13.016 --> 00:27:17.454
Your body has to become lighter so that it can transcend.

626
00:27:17.454 --> 00:27:21.191
Heavy foods will hold it to the Earth and hold it down.

627
00:27:21.191 --> 00:27:25.028
So they said especially stay away from heavy meats.

628
00:27:25.028 --> 00:27:29.432
The best foods to eat are live foods.

629
00:27:29.432 --> 00:27:31.869
These mean fresh fruits and vegetables.

630
00:27:31.869 --> 00:27:33.036
That's the best food.

631
00:27:33.036 --> 00:27:35.472
And if you can get organic, that's the best of all.

632
00:27:35.472 --> 00:27:38.642
You can eat some chicken and meat and fish,

633
00:27:38.642 --> 00:27:43.482
but not the heavy beefs and porks, none of that.

634
00:27:43.482 --> 00:27:48.118
They said to stay away from sugar as much as possible

635
00:27:48.118 --> 00:27:50.420
and drink lots and lots of water.

636
00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.659
The value of water is unbelievable.

637
00:27:53.659 --> 00:27:55.995
They said we have no concept of what that value

638
00:27:55.995 --> 00:27:59.028
of water is for the body.

639
00:27:59.028 --> 00:28:01.097
And after you do this a while, you'll find you won't

640
00:28:01.097 --> 00:28:03.433
even want the sweets anymore.

641
00:28:03.433 --> 00:28:06.036
You will gradually have just evolved away from that.

642
00:28:06.036 --> 00:28:07.704
<v Regina>That's true when you're properly hydrated,</v>

643
00:28:07.704 --> 00:28:09.973
which most of us are chronically dehydrated.

644
00:28:09.973 --> 00:28:12.242
And so you don't know what it feels like

645
00:28:12.242 --> 00:28:14.546
until you force yourself to go on a discipline.

646
00:28:14.546 --> 00:28:16.212
<v ->You go off of Pepsi and Coke.</v>

647
00:28:16.212 --> 00:28:18.081
<v Regina>Yes, you had to go through that.</v>

648
00:28:18.081 --> 00:28:19.850
<v ->Oh, I went through that, because for years</v>

649
00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:21.789
that was all I did.

650
00:28:21.789 --> 00:28:23.520
And they made me get off of it all.

651
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.788
<v Regina>Right, I remember that.</v>

652
00:28:24.788 --> 00:28:27.457
<v ->And now I don't want anything really sweet at all.</v>

653
00:28:27.457 --> 00:28:29.966
Because it does turn you off of that.

654
00:28:29.966 --> 00:28:32.428
But your diets will change.

655
00:28:32.428 --> 00:28:34.898
And they said eventually you are going to see yourself

656
00:28:34.898 --> 00:28:38.535
going into all liquids.

657
00:28:38.535 --> 00:28:40.302
And when I've been on the air and mentioned that

658
00:28:40.302 --> 00:28:41.771
people will call in and say,

659
00:28:41.771 --> 00:28:45.942
I wondered why I've been wanting to eat more smoothies.

660
00:28:45.942 --> 00:28:48.811
<v Regina>Yes, I feel the same way, yes.</v>

661
00:28:48.811 --> 00:28:51.748
I could be perfectly happy just drinking my meals,

662
00:28:51.748 --> 00:28:52.749
except for the occasional...

663
00:28:52.749 --> 00:28:54.684
<v ->Because that's where we're moving, into that part.</v>

664
00:28:54.684 --> 00:28:56.753
<v Regina>Yes, and our digestive systems are going</v>

665
00:28:56.753 --> 00:28:57.855
to be changing in the future, too.

666
00:28:57.855 --> 00:29:00.492
<v ->They are, they are changing now.</v>

667
00:29:00.492 --> 00:29:01.825
<v Regina>Yes, very interesting.</v>

668
00:29:01.825 --> 00:29:05.695
There's something in here that I was going to ask you about

669
00:29:05.695 --> 00:29:07.800
a moment ago.

670
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.134
The other thing which we're about to get into

671
00:29:10.134 --> 00:29:12.836
is the whole notion of what we have to do

672
00:29:12.836 --> 00:29:15.405
on an emotional, psycho-spiritual level as well.

673
00:29:15.405 --> 00:29:17.774
Now, we just talked about what we have to do for the body,

674
00:29:17.774 --> 00:29:21.445
but about the emotions that we perpetuate

675
00:29:21.445 --> 00:29:23.447
that keep creating the karma for ourselves.

676
00:29:23.447 --> 00:29:27.551
Anger, frustration, resentment against others

677
00:29:27.551 --> 00:29:30.854
and so forth, but also fear.

678
00:29:30.854 --> 00:29:33.890
I want to get into that, but I want to ask you something

679
00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:35.925
and I don't know if you're comfortable going there or not.

680
00:29:35.925 --> 00:29:37.361
<v ->Those are two things I've always been told</v>

681
00:29:37.361 --> 00:29:39.196
to cover in my lectures,

682
00:29:39.196 --> 00:29:40.631
so you're touching on them anyway.

683
00:29:40.631 --> 00:29:42.132
<v Regina>We're going to definitely go into them.</v>

684
00:29:42.132 --> 00:29:46.369
And the precursor to the fear is as we're trying

685
00:29:46.369 --> 00:29:49.439
to get through life, we're stumbling into every day

686
00:29:49.439 --> 00:29:52.508
these subliminal and not so subliminal messages.

687
00:29:52.508 --> 00:29:54.877
Media of every kind blaring out,

688
00:29:54.877 --> 00:29:58.314
creating, creating, creating false impressions

689
00:29:58.314 --> 00:30:00.484
of danger and negativity.

690
00:30:00.484 --> 00:30:04.521
Do you beings that work with you share information,

691
00:30:04.521 --> 00:30:06.890
and perhaps some of those that have also been regressed

692
00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:10.727
talk about another force that is trying

693
00:30:10.727 --> 00:30:12.930
to keep humanity asleep?

694
00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:14.665
Or do your beings say we're just doing it

695
00:30:14.665 --> 00:30:17.167
all to ourselves for greed?

696
00:30:17.167 --> 00:30:18.935
<v ->We're all doing it to ourselves, yes.</v>

697
00:30:18.935 --> 00:30:20.738
But this is important because you've touched

698
00:30:20.738 --> 00:30:25.008
on two things that they said you have to do.

699
00:30:25.008 --> 00:30:27.243
Now this first and second waves, like I've said

700
00:30:27.243 --> 00:30:29.750
they don't create karma.

701
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:31.681
They came in with none.

702
00:30:31.681 --> 00:30:36.653
And many of them have like a sheath that is over them

703
00:30:36.653 --> 00:30:39.389
to keep them from accumulating karma

704
00:30:39.389 --> 00:30:41.123
because they don't want to be stuck here.

705
00:30:41.123 --> 00:30:44.561
Now, it's the rest of us who have accumulated karma

706
00:30:44.561 --> 00:30:46.663
over the years.

707
00:30:46.663 --> 00:30:49.399
You can't go to the new Earth until you get rid

708
00:30:49.399 --> 00:30:51.901
of all the old karma.

709
00:30:51.901 --> 00:30:54.303
Because that's what ties you to the wheel of karma

710
00:30:54.303 --> 00:30:55.538
and to the Earth.

711
00:30:55.538 --> 00:30:58.145
You have to keep coming back to repay it.

712
00:30:58.145 --> 00:31:00.667
You can't move on as long as you're stuck

713
00:31:00.667 --> 00:31:03.045
having to repay it.

714
00:31:03.045 --> 00:31:07.751
So what we told people, you've got to let it go.

715
00:31:07.751 --> 00:31:09.953
And I tell my clients this all the time.

716
00:31:09.953 --> 00:31:12.122
This is usually the cause of their illness,

717
00:31:12.122 --> 00:31:13.868
it's the cause of all their problems.

718
00:31:13.868 --> 00:31:16.359
Holding onto all the garbage and the junk

719
00:31:16.359 --> 00:31:19.462
and the baggage that we carry around with us.

720
00:31:19.462 --> 00:31:21.197
<v Regina>Poisons us on every level.</v>

721
00:31:21.197 --> 00:31:23.699
<v ->That's when I say it gets to the point</v>

722
00:31:23.699 --> 00:31:28.605
that it doesn't matter if you were abused as a child.

723
00:31:28.605 --> 00:31:30.607
You got to let it go.

724
00:31:30.607 --> 00:31:32.442
Doesn't matter if your husband beat you up,

725
00:31:32.442 --> 00:31:34.310
you gotta let it go.

726
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:38.482
And people, you have to forgive, you have to release it

727
00:31:38.482 --> 00:31:40.250
or you're not going to go.

728
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:43.286
And I have clients that say I can't forgive them.

729
00:31:43.286 --> 00:31:45.621
You don't know what they did to me.

730
00:31:45.621 --> 00:31:47.495
But as long as they think like that,

731
00:31:47.495 --> 00:31:49.760
they are holding onto karma,

732
00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.828
you're going to have to come back and do it again

733
00:31:51.828 --> 00:31:54.932
with the same people, same circumstances,

734
00:31:54.932 --> 00:31:57.300
only worse next time.

735
00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.736
And they usually say, I don't want to do that.

736
00:31:59.736 --> 00:32:02.305
Well then I said, you'd better get rid of it now.

737
00:32:02.305 --> 00:32:05.975
And it's not easy because we do carry all this baggage

738
00:32:05.975 --> 00:32:07.810
around with us.

739
00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:11.080
And you have to let it go.

740
00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:15.251
You should feel such a wonderful relief when you do.

741
00:32:15.251 --> 00:32:16.118
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

742
00:32:16.118 --> 00:32:18.355
<v ->So I tell people, what you have to do,</v>

743
00:32:18.355 --> 00:32:21.058
even if the person you're angry at and have all

744
00:32:21.058 --> 00:32:23.226
of these bad feelings, even if they have already

745
00:32:23.226 --> 00:32:26.428
left the Earth, if they've died,

746
00:32:26.428 --> 00:32:29.165
you can still release this karma.

747
00:32:29.165 --> 00:32:31.534
You don't have to go to the person and face them

748
00:32:31.534 --> 00:32:33.703
face-to-face, that's very hard to do.

749
00:32:33.703 --> 00:32:36.108
You can do it mentally.

750
00:32:36.108 --> 00:32:39.075
And when you come into this Earth you make contracts

751
00:32:39.075 --> 00:32:40.945
with all of these people that you are going

752
00:32:40.945 --> 00:32:42.846
to try to work these things out.

753
00:32:42.846 --> 00:32:44.380
We get here, it's not that easy

754
00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:47.349
and it doesn't always happen.

755
00:32:47.349 --> 00:32:49.887
We get stuck in the same rut again.

756
00:32:49.887 --> 00:32:53.322
So I tell them, when you're going to do this,

757
00:32:53.322 --> 00:32:58.161
picture yourself tearing up the contract with that person.

758
00:33:00.405 --> 00:33:04.267
Tell them we tried, you do this mentally.

759
00:33:04.267 --> 00:33:08.538
We tried, we really tried, it didn't work.

760
00:33:08.538 --> 00:33:11.040
Let's tear up the contract.

761
00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:15.712
And you see yourself tearing it up and throwing it away.

762
00:33:15.712 --> 00:33:20.383
And you say, I forgive you, I release you,

763
00:33:20.383 --> 00:33:23.721
I let you go.

764
00:33:23.721 --> 00:33:27.656
You go your way, I'll go mine.

765
00:33:27.656 --> 00:33:31.361
We don't have to be connected any more at all.

766
00:33:31.361 --> 00:33:34.430
You've got to mean it, you've got to believe it.

767
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:38.134
And when you do, they have no more hold over you.

768
00:33:38.134 --> 00:33:41.137
They may try, they might try to push your buttons

769
00:33:41.137 --> 00:33:44.974
because they know what buttons to push.

770
00:33:44.974 --> 00:33:48.812
But if you really sincerely release them and let them go

771
00:33:48.812 --> 00:33:50.413
you won't have any more problems.

772
00:33:50.413 --> 00:33:54.383
They'll try, and it won't work because you have changed.

773
00:33:54.383 --> 00:33:57.052
<v Regina>And it seems to me the big part of this</v>

774
00:33:57.052 --> 00:34:00.257
until people can begin to understand that we are

775
00:34:00.257 --> 00:34:05.257
the captain of our souls, and take personal responsibility

776
00:34:06.329 --> 00:34:09.832
for having chosen such a role to subject one's self

777
00:34:09.832 --> 00:34:14.069
to such situations that we have to, in essence,

778
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:15.739
for us to respond to.

779
00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:16.740
We have a choice as to how we respond,

780
00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:17.807
whether we're going to be angry

781
00:34:17.807 --> 00:34:18.908
or whether we're going to forgive.

782
00:34:18.908 --> 00:34:20.947
We have to take responsibility.

783
00:34:20.947 --> 00:34:23.746
Something in our past, that hidden hand of karma

784
00:34:23.746 --> 00:34:26.682
has created the very situation that we're in.

785
00:34:26.682 --> 00:34:28.083
<v ->That's the second thing you have to do</v>

786
00:34:28.083 --> 00:34:31.188
is forgive yourself which is also very hard

787
00:34:31.188 --> 00:34:33.189
because it always takes two people.

788
00:34:33.189 --> 00:34:37.560
And you've had a part in creating the situation.

789
00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.897
So you have to also forgive yourself and you've got

790
00:34:40.897 --> 00:34:42.865
to really mean it.

791
00:34:42.865 --> 00:34:46.169
And when you do, your whole life will change.

792
00:34:46.169 --> 00:34:47.708
And this is the first thing you have to do

793
00:34:47.708 --> 00:34:51.274
if you're going to go with everyone else to the new Earth.

794
00:34:51.274 --> 00:34:55.177
The second thing, you have to let go of fear.

795
00:34:55.177 --> 00:34:58.749
Fear is a very paralyzing emotion.

796
00:34:58.749 --> 00:35:01.752
If you don't understand something, you're afraid of it.

797
00:35:01.752 --> 00:35:05.555
And as long as you have fear, you're held to the old Earth.

798
00:35:05.555 --> 00:35:08.892
Because that's where the fear comes from.

799
00:35:08.892 --> 00:35:11.073
That's why I tell people don't buy into the things

800
00:35:11.073 --> 00:35:13.196
that you see on television.

801
00:35:13.196 --> 00:35:16.265
Don't buy into what you have in the newspapers.

802
00:35:16.265 --> 00:35:18.170
Think for yourself.

803
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:20.436
It's all to generate fear.

804
00:35:20.436 --> 00:35:23.072
The church is just as bad, generate fear.

805
00:35:23.072 --> 00:35:24.640
The government is to generate fear.

806
00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.709
As long as they can generate fear

807
00:35:26.709 --> 00:35:29.345
they will keep you suppressed.

808
00:35:29.345 --> 00:35:34.051
So you don't buy into it, think for yourself.

809
00:35:34.051 --> 00:35:36.820
And if you hear something that doesn't make a lot of sense,

810
00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:39.222
ask a lot of questions.

811
00:35:39.222 --> 00:35:41.924
I always think, well why are they saying this?

812
00:35:41.924 --> 00:35:46.161
Why are they trying to spread this notion?

813
00:35:46.161 --> 00:35:48.999
It's there for a reason, what are they trying to do?

814
00:35:48.999 --> 00:35:53.603
You start asking questions and then make up your own mind.

815
00:35:53.603 --> 00:35:55.738
Then you develop your own truth.

816
00:35:55.738 --> 00:35:59.141
It may not be what I believe or what anyone else believes,

817
00:35:59.141 --> 00:36:01.010
but it is your truth.

818
00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:04.347
Don't give your power away to anyone.

819
00:36:04.347 --> 00:36:06.654
You have to release all of this fear,

820
00:36:06.654 --> 00:36:09.055
then you won't be tied to the new Earth.

821
00:36:09.055 --> 00:36:10.987
So those two things you have to do if you're going

822
00:36:10.987 --> 00:36:13.355
to progress and go with the new Earth

823
00:36:13.355 --> 00:36:16.292
which is going to be glorious and wonderful.

824
00:36:16.292 --> 00:36:20.430
Let go of karma, and let go of fear.

825
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:22.866
<v Regina>So the fear producing mechanisms</v>

826
00:36:22.866 --> 00:36:26.341
on this planet, the beings and the information you've gotten

827
00:36:26.341 --> 00:36:30.973
are simply a manifestation of the collective consciousness

828
00:36:30.973 --> 00:36:32.141
of this planet?

829
00:36:32.141 --> 00:36:32.909
Or is there...

830
00:36:32.909 --> 00:36:34.611
<v ->There are beings that do it on purpose.</v>

831
00:36:34.611 --> 00:36:36.213
<v Regina>Well, that's what I'm asking, yes.</v>

832
00:36:36.213 --> 00:36:38.881
<v ->You know the church, if you want to consider that a being</v>

833
00:36:38.881 --> 00:36:41.317
is doing its thing.

834
00:36:41.317 --> 00:36:43.586
And the government is doing its thing in order

835
00:36:43.586 --> 00:36:45.855
to maintain control.

836
00:36:45.855 --> 00:36:49.628
But we have power of our own that we don't realize.

837
00:36:49.628 --> 00:36:50.794
Are we going to buy into it?

838
00:36:50.794 --> 00:36:53.263
Are we going to

839
00:36:53.263 --> 00:36:56.366
go with it, and then it just creates more and more fear.

840
00:36:56.366 --> 00:36:57.266
<v Regina>Exactly.</v>

841
00:36:57.266 --> 00:36:58.968
<v ->See, you're going to have two worlds,</v>

842
00:36:58.968 --> 00:37:00.903
which world are you going to live in?

843
00:37:00.903 --> 00:37:02.337
<v Regina>You have to choose.</v>

844
00:37:02.337 --> 00:37:04.139
<v ->I tell people it is your choice.</v>

845
00:37:04.139 --> 00:37:06.443
If you want to stay with that world that has all

846
00:37:06.443 --> 00:37:07.844
of that junk happening.

847
00:37:07.844 --> 00:37:09.779
People say, oh what about the economics?

848
00:37:09.779 --> 00:37:11.881
What about all of these horrible things

849
00:37:11.881 --> 00:37:14.083
that are happening to the world, all the catastrophes?

850
00:37:14.083 --> 00:37:16.988
Is that the world you want to live in?

851
00:37:16.988 --> 00:37:19.021
Then you can have it.

852
00:37:19.021 --> 00:37:21.524
Or do you want to live in the positive world?

853
00:37:21.524 --> 00:37:25.195
They are both real, you hear about them on TV all the time.

854
00:37:25.195 --> 00:37:26.595
But is that your world?

855
00:37:26.595 --> 00:37:28.464
Is that where your focus is going to be?

856
00:37:28.464 --> 00:37:31.903
Or are you going to focus on this other world?

857
00:37:31.903 --> 00:37:33.206
You have a choice.

858
00:37:33.206 --> 00:37:34.103
<v Regina>Yes, and in reality</v>

859
00:37:34.103 --> 00:37:36.138
the planet's already divided that way.

860
00:37:36.138 --> 00:37:39.109
In reality, people who are living a very, very heavy,

861
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:42.745
difficult karma-ridden life and not able

862
00:37:42.745 --> 00:37:45.014
to find their way out, suffering from depression,

863
00:37:45.014 --> 00:37:46.382
violence, and so forth,

864
00:37:46.382 --> 00:37:48.552
have no awareness of people that might be living

865
00:37:48.552 --> 00:37:52.087
in exactly the opposite experience and spectrum already.

866
00:37:52.087 --> 00:37:55.291
People are unaware of each other's realities.

867
00:37:55.291 --> 00:37:58.028
This just makes, what you're saying makes it official.

868
00:37:58.028 --> 00:38:00.230
The two worlds are torn apart.

869
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:03.132
So it's very important the people understand

870
00:38:03.132 --> 00:38:05.634
this information and start, number one

871
00:38:05.634 --> 00:38:07.471
this is the planet of choice, free will.

872
00:38:07.471 --> 00:38:10.440
This is an amazing, an amazing experiment.

873
00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.109
So let's talk a little bit about some of the glimpses

874
00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:16.045
you've been shown of the new Earth

875
00:38:16.045 --> 00:38:17.714
before we wrap it up, because I know you have a lecture

876
00:38:17.714 --> 00:38:18.447
in a little bit.

877
00:38:18.447 --> 00:38:20.048
And you've had almost no sleep.

878
00:38:20.048 --> 00:38:22.151
So just give us a little tease

879
00:38:22.151 --> 00:38:23.719
of what the new Earth is about.

880
00:38:23.719 --> 00:38:25.088
And then we'll encourage everyone to pick up

881
00:38:25.088 --> 00:38:27.891
some of your books and attend your lectures.

882
00:38:27.891 --> 00:38:29.425
<v ->This is what I'm going to talk about</v>

883
00:38:29.425 --> 00:38:32.428
tonight in the lecture.

884
00:38:32.428 --> 00:38:36.632
Well, they can't tell us exactly because no one knows.

885
00:38:36.632 --> 00:38:39.001
But it will be where your focus is.

886
00:38:39.001 --> 00:38:41.742
But we're going to take the technology and we're going

887
00:38:41.742 --> 00:38:43.739
to do wonderful things with it.

888
00:38:43.739 --> 00:38:45.375
And we're going to be going into a world

889
00:38:45.375 --> 00:38:47.110
where there won't be any illness

890
00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:49.746
and we can live as long as we want.

891
00:38:49.746 --> 00:38:51.514
At first when you go you will take

892
00:38:51.514 --> 00:38:53.716
your physical body with you.

893
00:38:53.716 --> 00:38:55.117
And then after you've been there a while

894
00:38:55.117 --> 00:38:58.054
you will turn into beings of light.

895
00:38:58.054 --> 00:39:01.257
It's going to be a wonderful, beautiful place.

896
00:39:01.257 --> 00:39:04.627
There's colors, there's things there you can't even imagine.

897
00:39:04.627 --> 00:39:06.429
But it won't happen instantly.

898
00:39:06.429 --> 00:39:08.297
We're in the middle of it right now.

899
00:39:08.297 --> 00:39:10.034
People say when is it going to happen?

900
00:39:10.034 --> 00:39:14.137
It is happening now, but it's a gradual process.

901
00:39:14.137 --> 00:39:17.273
And you won't just wake up one morning on 2012

902
00:39:17.273 --> 00:39:19.141
and say wow, everything is different.

903
00:39:19.141 --> 00:39:21.343
It's very subtle.

904
00:39:21.343 --> 00:39:23.779
You'll begin to notice little changes

905
00:39:23.779 --> 00:39:25.850
and little things that are different.

906
00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:29.486
And then you'll be there.

907
00:39:29.486 --> 00:39:32.388
<v Regina>So, as long as we make a wise choice</v>

908
00:39:32.388 --> 00:39:35.257
and are willing to back it up with some wise action,

909
00:39:35.257 --> 00:39:37.293
it's all going to be good.

910
00:39:37.293 --> 00:39:39.728
<v ->This is a very important time to be alive.</v>

911
00:39:39.728 --> 00:39:41.731
Many exciting things are happening.

912
00:39:41.731 --> 00:39:43.970
<v Regina>Yes, indeed, well thank you so much, Dolores,</v>

913
00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:47.069
for spending some time, especially in a crunching schedule

914
00:39:47.069 --> 00:39:49.205
like this, I don't know how you do it.

915
00:39:49.205 --> 00:39:50.990
Thank you.

916
00:39:52.474 --> 00:39:54.010
To get a better understanding of the genesis

917
00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:55.978
of Dolores' work, you might want to watch

918
00:39:55.978 --> 00:39:57.646
our other interview with her.

919
00:39:57.646 --> 00:39:59.916
In addition, she's written more than two dozen books

920
00:39:59.916 --> 00:40:02.818
which you can find on her website at Ozark Mountain

921
00:40:02.818 --> 00:40:06.089
which is abbreviated to ozarkmt.com.

922
00:40:06.089 --> 00:40:08.974
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
