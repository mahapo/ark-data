00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:15.049
<v ->Have you ever shun the notion of systems of typology</v>

3
00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:17.261
that categorize your personality traits?

4
00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:20.139
Well, I've just learned that that's a type itself.

5
00:00:20.139 --> 00:00:23.033
Dr. David Daniels is a Clinical Professor of Psychiatry

6
00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:24.841
at Stanford Medical School.

7
00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:27.582
And there was a time when he had to hide his interest

8
00:00:27.582 --> 00:00:30.037
in the system of typology known as the enneagram

9
00:00:30.037 --> 00:00:31.381
from his co-workers.

10
00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:33.402
But after studying the incredible potential

11
00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:35.850
of the system of personality typology

12
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.854
he couldn't keep it a secret any longer.

13
00:00:37.854 --> 00:00:39.897
Today, after authoring one of the primary guides

14
00:00:39.897 --> 00:00:42.392
to the subject, the "The Essential Enneagram",

15
00:00:42.392 --> 00:00:44.398
and conducting in-depth studies,

16
00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:46.279
David believes the enneagram is one

17
00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:48.291
of the most powerful tools out there

18
00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:51.527
to help heal our relationship with ourselves and others.

19
00:00:51.527 --> 00:00:52.678
I would agree.

20
00:01:01.024 --> 00:01:03.152
Your degree and background is in psychiatry,

21
00:01:03.152 --> 00:01:07.878
you're a doctor of psychiatry, yet you find yourself

22
00:01:07.878 --> 00:01:11.160
these years later as really an icon in the area

23
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.542
of the enneagram.

24
00:01:12.542 --> 00:01:14.555
Now most people, they've heard of the enneagram

25
00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:17.092
but don't really even understand what the enneagram is

26
00:01:17.092 --> 00:01:20.603
and we'll get into how you ended up on this path.

27
00:01:20.603 --> 00:01:23.108
But first, can you give us kind of some background

28
00:01:23.108 --> 00:01:24.241
on what the enneagram is.

29
00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:27.150
<v ->Yes, the enneagram is nothing mysterious.</v>

30
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.306
An ennea or ennea is just simply Greek for "nine",

31
00:01:30.306 --> 00:01:34.566
so it means it's about nine fundamental personality styles.

32
00:01:37.124 --> 00:01:39.743
As a child, I understood what a decagon was,

33
00:01:39.743 --> 00:01:41.196
meaning a 10-sided figure,

34
00:01:41.196 --> 00:01:43.653
I knew an octagon, an eight-sided figure,

35
00:01:43.653 --> 00:01:46.199
but I never knew what enneagon was for some reason.

36
00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:47.635
I have no idea.

37
00:01:47.635 --> 00:01:50.955
But if the pentagon in the United States had had nine sides

38
00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:53.781
everybody in the United States and most of the world

39
00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:55.651
would naturally know what an enneagon

40
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:57.253
or nine-sided figure was.

41
00:01:57.253 --> 00:01:57.975
<v Voiceover>It makes total sense.</v>

42
00:01:57.975 --> 00:01:59.830
Most people have never heard of that.

43
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.654
<v ->So it's simply nine-sided figure representing</v>

44
00:02:02.654 --> 00:02:06.258
nine personality types with numbers on them, one to nine,

45
00:02:06.258 --> 00:02:09.409
no one type is any better or worse than any other type

46
00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.150
or any more healthy or less healthy.

47
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.778
In fact there is a study, a longitudinal study,

48
00:02:13.778 --> 00:02:16.587
done by Stella Chess and Alexander Thomas

49
00:02:16.587 --> 00:02:19.954
back in the '60s and '70s looking at children.

50
00:02:19.954 --> 00:02:24.095
And they found little children, three to 18 months old,

51
00:02:24.095 --> 00:02:27.501
had nine fundamental personality styles

52
00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:31.402
or fundamental temperaments.

53
00:02:31.402 --> 00:02:34.074
And those temperaments as these children grew into adulthood

54
00:02:34.074 --> 00:02:36.917
all had just as much health,

55
00:02:36.917 --> 00:02:39.828
anyone would be just as healthy as any other one.

56
00:02:39.828 --> 00:02:40.645
So there's no--

57
00:02:40.645 --> 00:02:41.666
<v Voiceover>And do this correlate</v>

58
00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:43.019
to the enneagram typology?

59
00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.943
<v ->Well they didn't have any interest in the enneagram.</v>

60
00:02:44.943 --> 00:02:47.640
I wrote a paper on it when I discovered this.

61
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.817
Our daughter being a developmental psychologist

62
00:02:49.817 --> 00:02:52.408
when I was looking at this work, I said,

63
00:02:52.408 --> 00:02:55.143
"My goodness here's these nine fundamental temperaments,"

64
00:02:55.143 --> 00:02:57.482
and they knew nothing about the enneagram

65
00:02:57.482 --> 00:03:00.063
and the descriptions fit perfectly with the enneagram.

66
00:03:00.063 --> 00:03:01.541
<v Voiceover>Interesting.</v>

67
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:04.647
But now for you, I mean you were in

68
00:03:04.647 --> 00:03:06.645
Stanford University, exactly.

69
00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:08.412
I mean, this could've come easily.

70
00:03:08.412 --> 00:03:13.412
<v ->I hated typologies because in our system typologies</v>

71
00:03:13.696 --> 00:03:16.932
were these terrible personality disorder diagnoses.

72
00:03:18.068 --> 00:03:20.360
I'm, for example, a sixth on the enneagram,

73
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.949
Type 6, the loyal skeptic.

74
00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:24.372
Well, that would be called paranoid personality.

75
00:03:24.372 --> 00:03:26.282
That's not a very nice thing.

76
00:03:26.282 --> 00:03:28.167
And you understand you're a Type 7,

77
00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:31.142
so you'd be the epicure or the positive adventurer

78
00:03:31.142 --> 00:03:35.615
but the negative about that would be you're narcissistic

79
00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:38.082
and you just wanna do what you wanna do.

80
00:03:38.082 --> 00:03:40.209
And the eighth going the around the circle,

81
00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.179
you can start any place of course,

82
00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:44.348
is a big powerful type and they'd be

83
00:03:44.348 --> 00:03:45.829
do what you wanna do in your truth;

84
00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.218
they'd be called sociopaths.

85
00:03:47.218 --> 00:03:49.642
And nine at the top, the go along get along type,

86
00:03:49.642 --> 00:03:52.600
is just the mediator would dig in

87
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.138
and be called passive/aggressive or negativistic.

88
00:03:55.138 --> 00:03:56.897
And then Type 1, the perfectionist,

89
00:03:56.897 --> 00:03:59.479
would be obsessive/compulsive like Scott.

90
00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:02.635
And Type 2, the giver, would be, oh hysterical

91
00:04:02.635 --> 00:04:06.048
or dependent upon people, being dependent upon them

92
00:04:06.048 --> 00:04:07.885
because they're always giving to everybody else

93
00:04:07.885 --> 00:04:10.167
and that makes the dependency.

94
00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:12.628
The Type 3, well for a long time in the United States

95
00:04:12.628 --> 00:04:15.781
didn't have any because workaholism is considered healthy

96
00:04:15.781 --> 00:04:18.316
when you look through our culture filters.

97
00:04:18.316 --> 00:04:22.262
So now workaholism is of course the performer, Type 3,

98
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.759
is now got a diagnosis too.

99
00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.146
Type 4, the romantic that had an idealism

100
00:04:29.146 --> 00:04:30.500
could also be depressed.

101
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.888
And so depressive personality was the romantic.

102
00:04:34.888 --> 00:04:37.754
And then Type 5, the really intellectual

103
00:04:37.754 --> 00:04:40.882
but somewhat withdrawn type would be called schizoid.

104
00:04:40.882 --> 00:04:43.716
So all these personality typologies, I hated it.

105
00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:45.636
<v Voiceover>I can see why psychiatry and enneagram</v>

106
00:04:45.636 --> 00:04:48.430
would make strange bedfellows yet here you are.

107
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.987
So what happened?

108
00:04:49.987 --> 00:04:51.274
What piqued your interest?

109
00:04:51.274 --> 00:04:54.344
<v ->Well it seemed so powerful to me because it's literally</v>

110
00:04:54.344 --> 00:04:57.015
about the way we organize reality,

111
00:04:57.015 --> 00:04:59.120
the patterns that we organize reality.

112
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.718
And I want to tell you about how this fits

113
00:05:00.718 --> 00:05:03.052
with our neurobiology in the moment.

114
00:05:03.052 --> 00:05:06.045
But I had recognized in my own work and working people

115
00:05:06.045 --> 00:05:08.093
that some people couldn't get into their feelings,

116
00:05:08.093 --> 00:05:09.771
and some people couldn't get out of their feelings,

117
00:05:09.771 --> 00:05:11.741
and some people always self-judging,

118
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:13.587
and always critical about things,

119
00:05:13.587 --> 00:05:15.546
and some people, like myself, who were skeptics

120
00:05:15.546 --> 00:05:18.544
or doubting and sometimes had excessive fear,

121
00:05:18.544 --> 00:05:20.897
some people would just go ahead energy.

122
00:05:20.897 --> 00:05:24.906
So I almost had all the types in my own steady,

123
00:05:24.906 --> 00:05:27.681
just from our own intuitive work.

124
00:05:27.681 --> 00:05:29.173
And when I discovered the enneagram,

125
00:05:29.173 --> 00:05:31.837
about these nine fundamental patterns

126
00:05:31.837 --> 00:05:35.084
of the way we organize the world, the way we think,

127
00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:37.219
the way we feel, the way we sense things

128
00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:39.331
and the way we behave in the world

129
00:05:39.331 --> 00:05:43.317
it just seemed like, "Oh here's this remarkable system

130
00:05:43.317 --> 00:05:45.421
"that tells us about how we operate in the world

131
00:05:45.421 --> 00:05:47.392
"according to patterns."

132
00:05:47.392 --> 00:05:50.296
And those patterns own us in the beginning.

133
00:05:50.296 --> 00:05:52.593
And the whole deal is to get some more liberation,

134
00:05:52.593 --> 00:05:54.590
get some freedom to get out of the patterns,

135
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.173
the enneagram is a liberation psychology,

136
00:05:57.173 --> 00:05:59.600
so that I'm not owned and constricted and confined

137
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.481
by my personality type.

138
00:06:01.481 --> 00:06:03.450
<v Voiceover>And most of us are until we die.</v>

139
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:04.748
<v ->And most of us are.</v>

140
00:06:04.748 --> 00:06:07.599
And of course we all have very good qualities

141
00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:10.834
and we have qualities about us that are challenging

142
00:06:10.834 --> 00:06:13.009
about ourselves and to others.

143
00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:16.189
And the whole idea of the enneagram is to become aware

144
00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:17.661
of how these patterns operate

145
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:20.612
so that you can get more liberation.

146
00:06:20.612 --> 00:06:24.783
So remember that the way we organize attention

147
00:06:24.783 --> 00:06:29.252
and energy in those patterns define the behavior

148
00:06:29.252 --> 00:06:30.441
in the life we live in.

149
00:06:30.441 --> 00:06:32.774
If we can become aware of those patterns

150
00:06:32.774 --> 00:06:35.562
it gives us a chance to become more liberated from them,

151
00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:37.476
it takes self-observation to do this.

152
00:06:37.476 --> 00:06:38.874
We'll come back to that.

153
00:06:38.874 --> 00:06:40.552
But it takes self-observation to be able

154
00:06:40.552 --> 00:06:42.436
to see what our patterns are

155
00:06:42.436 --> 00:06:44.433
and then to gain some freedom from it.

156
00:06:44.433 --> 00:06:45.894
So it's huge.

157
00:06:45.894 --> 00:06:48.767
<v Voiceover>And there was a bit of an internal struggle,</v>

158
00:06:48.767 --> 00:06:50.680
but not just internal.

159
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.616
We were talking off camera a bit ago and you said

160
00:06:52.616 --> 00:06:56.180
you were a closet fan of the enneagram

161
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.696
for a long, long time.

162
00:06:57.696 --> 00:06:59.541
Maybe you could tell your peers about it.

163
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:02.861
<v ->For about 18 months until I decided it's so powerful,</v>

164
00:07:02.861 --> 00:07:06.390
so fundamental that it was time to come out of the closet.

165
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.722
Because in psychiatry, this is a system that was both

166
00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:12.890
honored in a spiritual dimension

167
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.054
as well as the personality dimension.

168
00:07:15.054 --> 00:07:18.795
And literally, we work at how we can integrate,

169
00:07:18.795 --> 00:07:22.844
that is interrelate these two differentiated parts,

170
00:07:22.844 --> 00:07:24.963
how do you link these two differentiated things

171
00:07:24.963 --> 00:07:27.338
about a spiritual life on the one hand

172
00:07:27.338 --> 00:07:29.365
and a personality life on the other hand

173
00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:30.922
that bring them together.

174
00:07:30.922 --> 00:07:34.401
Most psychology a few decades ago

175
00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:37.144
was prenegative about the spiritual life,

176
00:07:37.144 --> 00:07:39.684
that's changed of course, but it was like myths,

177
00:07:39.684 --> 00:07:41.735
it was not something you could validate

178
00:07:41.735 --> 00:07:43.576
and lots of the spiritual traditions

179
00:07:43.576 --> 00:07:45.206
sort of negated personality said,

180
00:07:45.206 --> 00:07:47.133
"Get rid of your fault personality."

181
00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:50.318
But this is about how do we integrate these two great ways

182
00:07:50.318 --> 00:07:53.561
of knowing and understanding so that we can live more full,

183
00:07:53.561 --> 00:07:56.261
more realized, more whole lives.

184
00:07:56.261 --> 00:07:57.684
<v Voiceover>Well you can tell, reading your book</v>

185
00:07:57.684 --> 00:08:02.472
and just even thinking about it as a concept

186
00:08:02.472 --> 00:08:04.525
it certainly would do us a world of good

187
00:08:04.525 --> 00:08:06.814
in terms of our interpersonal relationships.

188
00:08:06.814 --> 00:08:09.310
Now this was years ago and you've been on this

189
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.743
for quite a long time and you've done

190
00:08:10.743 --> 00:08:14.779
some very extensive studies over the course of several years

191
00:08:14.779 --> 00:08:17.570
with some of the participants or subjects, is that correct?

192
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.042
<v ->This is true, this is true.</v>

193
00:08:19.042 --> 00:08:22.454
And many people find that this is powerfully life changing,

194
00:08:22.454 --> 00:08:25.487
actually transformative, very liberating.

195
00:08:25.487 --> 00:08:28.057
Because lots of people go, "Well I don't wanna be

196
00:08:28.057 --> 00:08:30.511
"put in a box, I don't wanna be typed."

197
00:08:30.511 --> 00:08:33.428
I go, "Oh my gosh, that's a typology."

198
00:08:33.428 --> 00:08:36.138
There's the people that believe in typing people,

199
00:08:36.138 --> 00:08:38.554
they're the bad people, and the people that don't believe

200
00:08:38.554 --> 00:08:40.808
in typing people, those are the good people;

201
00:08:40.808 --> 00:08:43.217
but that's a typology, there's only two types.

202
00:08:43.217 --> 00:08:44.617
<v Voiceover>I mean, how closely does that align</v>

203
00:08:44.617 --> 00:08:47.317
in people's first reaction to stereotyping?

204
00:08:47.317 --> 00:08:48.308
<v ->The stereotyping.</v>

205
00:08:48.308 --> 00:08:52.021
And of course stereotyping is the bane of human existence,

206
00:08:52.021 --> 00:08:55.049
whether it's about race, or religion, or culture,

207
00:08:55.049 --> 00:08:58.581
or sexual orientation or whatever it is.

208
00:08:58.581 --> 00:09:01.696
It's not just a typology but typologies have a tendency

209
00:09:01.696 --> 00:09:04.484
to devolve into stereotypologies.

210
00:09:04.484 --> 00:09:06.105
So the way we teach the enneagram

211
00:09:06.105 --> 00:09:08.027
is called the narrative tradition

212
00:09:08.027 --> 00:09:10.196
where the type speak for themselves.

213
00:09:10.196 --> 00:09:14.347
They teach us about how they operate and we learn from them.

214
00:09:14.347 --> 00:09:18.108
It's not like, "I'm a teacher describing somebody

215
00:09:18.108 --> 00:09:19.220
"as they are."

216
00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.065
I work with people, I do inquiry, and to elicit,

217
00:09:23.065 --> 00:09:25.745
an understanding in a deeper understanding,

218
00:09:25.745 --> 00:09:28.455
and everybody that works with us is representing themselves

219
00:09:28.455 --> 00:09:30.346
as they are to themselves.

220
00:09:30.346 --> 00:09:32.065
It's a very powerful method.

221
00:09:32.065 --> 00:09:33.867
<v Voiceover>And you say this starts hardwiring</v>

222
00:09:33.867 --> 00:09:38.004
very early in life, this is actually driven to an extent

223
00:09:38.004 --> 00:09:40.096
by our neurological wiring.

224
00:09:40.096 --> 00:09:42.348
Can you talk about what imprints what

225
00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:45.195
and how this becomes so set as personality trait.

226
00:09:45.195 --> 00:09:48.998
<v ->Well we know from the longitudinal studies by Stella Chess</v>

227
00:09:48.998 --> 00:09:51.920
and Alexander Thomas back in the '60s and '70s,

228
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.803
they recognize nine fundamental temperaments

229
00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:57.333
in infants three to 18 months old.

230
00:09:57.333 --> 00:10:00.289
Those nine temperaments articulated perfectly

231
00:10:00.289 --> 00:10:02.905
with the enneagram nine styles.

232
00:10:02.905 --> 00:10:06.100
And they showed that as these children grew into adulthood

233
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.757
no type was any more or less healthy than any other type.

234
00:10:09.757 --> 00:10:12.676
But they're there very early as the environment

235
00:10:12.676 --> 00:10:16.081
and our genetics or temperament interact with each other

236
00:10:16.081 --> 00:10:18.169
right from the beginning of the conception,

237
00:10:18.169 --> 00:10:21.616
so that we form these styles as adaptive strategies

238
00:10:21.616 --> 00:10:24.361
based upon our environmental experience

239
00:10:24.361 --> 00:10:26.809
that we have before we even have explicit memory,

240
00:10:26.809 --> 00:10:28.648
just implicit memory in our bodies,

241
00:10:28.648 --> 00:10:30.749
in our hearts, in our emotions

242
00:10:30.749 --> 00:10:34.036
before we have all these logical stuff in place

243
00:10:34.036 --> 00:10:36.039
as ways of adapting to the world.

244
00:10:36.039 --> 00:10:38.766
So with my strategy, for instance, as a sixth

245
00:10:38.766 --> 00:10:41.306
where you feel like you can't trust in the world,

246
00:10:41.306 --> 00:10:43.261
where you've lost the sense of faith,

247
00:10:43.261 --> 00:10:45.596
where the world is unpredictable and untrustworthy

248
00:10:45.596 --> 00:10:48.455
you wanna seek certainty, you wanna figure it out

249
00:10:48.455 --> 00:10:50.508
and you're gonna look for how things could go wrong

250
00:10:50.508 --> 00:10:52.677
so they won't go wrong and for what,

251
00:10:52.677 --> 00:10:54.638
worst case could come up so that you can keep

252
00:10:54.638 --> 00:10:56.759
the worst case from happening.

253
00:10:58.292 --> 00:10:59.276
<v Voiceover>Talk to us a little bit,</v>

254
00:10:59.276 --> 00:11:00.955
I wanna use an example right here,

255
00:11:00.955 --> 00:11:03.113
not to derail the conversation,

256
00:11:03.113 --> 00:11:06.393
but we're talking off camera about a corporation

257
00:11:06.393 --> 00:11:09.948
that had basically the risk takers, all of the people

258
00:11:09.948 --> 00:11:12.529
at the helm were the charge forward types.

259
00:11:12.529 --> 00:11:13.953
Can you talk about that a little bit?

260
00:11:13.953 --> 00:11:16.079
What happens when you get a group of them--

261
00:11:16.079 --> 00:11:19.389
<v ->This was a wonderful team that was working,</v>

262
00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:22.857
they had 825 retail stores and they were going about

263
00:11:22.857 --> 00:11:25.026
the process of expansion.

264
00:11:25.026 --> 00:11:26.972
They had all assertive, move forward,

265
00:11:26.972 --> 00:11:30.694
go getter types in their executive team.

266
00:11:30.694 --> 00:11:33.119
And they get started on something and then, wow,

267
00:11:33.119 --> 00:11:35.168
they should've stopped and look at what could go wrong

268
00:11:35.168 --> 00:11:36.969
about a mile ago.

269
00:11:36.969 --> 00:11:39.260
And so they have to spend a lot of energy

270
00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.734
on recouping their mistakes.

271
00:11:42.734 --> 00:11:44.826
Well they needed somebody, like myself,

272
00:11:44.826 --> 00:11:46.467
with a more skeptical orientation

273
00:11:46.467 --> 00:11:48.101
that could look at what could go wrong

274
00:11:48.101 --> 00:11:49.495
and not get stuck in it but could look at

275
00:11:49.495 --> 00:11:52.156
what could go wrong so they wouldn't go charging off

276
00:11:52.156 --> 00:11:55.147
without looking, "Was this really a good idea?"

277
00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:57.652
So the solution was not to go out and get a six

278
00:11:57.652 --> 00:12:00.312
or some other type, it was to adopt the function

279
00:12:00.312 --> 00:12:02.608
that was necessary, the skeptical function,

280
00:12:02.608 --> 00:12:04.408
to be able to adopt that in their team.

281
00:12:04.408 --> 00:12:07.071
"Well this could go wrong so we need to look out for that,

282
00:12:07.071 --> 00:12:09.241
"so we don't just go down that pathway."

283
00:12:09.241 --> 00:12:10.391
<v Voiceover>And they were able to adapt.</v>

284
00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:12.472
<v ->They were able to do that and made a huge difference</v>

285
00:12:12.472 --> 00:12:14.117
because they were wonderful people,

286
00:12:14.117 --> 00:12:17.042
very effective in their work, caring about each other.

287
00:12:17.042 --> 00:12:19.913
And when they realized what they were missing

288
00:12:19.913 --> 00:12:22.253
because their patterns didn't allow them to do that

289
00:12:22.253 --> 00:12:25.108
and they corrected that it really helped them.

290
00:12:25.108 --> 00:12:27.032
<v Voiceover>So would you say the process</v>

291
00:12:27.032 --> 00:12:30.244
of having the ability to adapt is even,

292
00:12:30.244 --> 00:12:32.248
part of our own maturation process

293
00:12:32.248 --> 00:12:36.037
no matter which one of the types we fall into?

294
00:12:36.037 --> 00:12:36.912
<v ->That's right.</v>

295
00:12:36.912 --> 00:12:41.912
We need to recognize what's challenging about ourselves

296
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.674
and what gets other people upset and would we get upset

297
00:12:44.674 --> 00:12:47.390
and how would we react to ourselves.

298
00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:50.476
All of us have strengths in our particular patterns

299
00:12:50.476 --> 00:12:53.080
and all of us have challenges or limitations.

300
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.021
And it's the challenges and limitations

301
00:12:55.021 --> 00:12:56.933
that we don't want to have own us.

302
00:12:56.933 --> 00:12:58.077
<v Voiceover>And those are the ones that are developed</v>

303
00:12:58.077 --> 00:13:01.741
very early in life as, basically, skills for contending

304
00:13:01.741 --> 00:13:03.906
with the external world.

305
00:13:03.906 --> 00:13:06.949
<v ->Making a good life, they're adaptive strategies</v>

306
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:09.627
not just coping strategies to have a full

307
00:13:09.627 --> 00:13:11.035
and satisfying life.

308
00:13:11.035 --> 00:13:13.244
And then they turn out to be anachronistic

309
00:13:13.244 --> 00:13:16.098
when we grow up either based upon very early things

310
00:13:16.098 --> 00:13:17.571
and that no longer true.

311
00:13:17.571 --> 00:13:20.263
Like I don't need to worry about not counting on the world,

312
00:13:20.263 --> 00:13:23.030
I can count on myself, I can trust in people

313
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:25.548
and I've worked at reclaiming a kind of sense of faith

314
00:13:25.548 --> 00:13:27.754
that brings back that higher essential quality

315
00:13:27.754 --> 00:13:30.677
to just with myself as an example.

316
00:13:30.677 --> 00:13:33.508
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about the first contact</v>

317
00:13:33.508 --> 00:13:34.498
with the enneagram.

318
00:13:34.498 --> 00:13:36.599
One of the things I've noticed in years past

319
00:13:36.599 --> 00:13:40.413
were people say, "Hey, do you know your enneagram type?"

320
00:13:40.413 --> 00:13:43.362
"No, not really, I'm not really clear on it."

321
00:13:43.362 --> 00:13:47.282
And that's because it's not something that can be quantified

322
00:13:47.282 --> 00:13:50.107
by any data with that kind of certainty.

323
00:13:50.107 --> 00:13:53.704
It's really a process of honesty, self-evaluation,

324
00:13:53.704 --> 00:13:57.873
very frank self-evaluation, and internal knowing.

325
00:13:57.873 --> 00:13:59.697
<v ->Exactly.</v>

326
00:13:59.697 --> 00:14:02.646
Here's something, most typologies

327
00:14:02.646 --> 00:14:05.320
have not had very much predictive value,

328
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.565
if not really been really greatly valued

329
00:14:09.565 --> 00:14:12.001
because they're about external behaviors

330
00:14:12.001 --> 00:14:14.262
and a lot of people with different type share them.

331
00:14:14.262 --> 00:14:17.265
The whole enneagram is about how we organize

332
00:14:17.265 --> 00:14:20.027
internal reality and how that gets expressed.

333
00:14:20.027 --> 00:14:21.259
And what's driving it?

334
00:14:21.259 --> 00:14:23.695
What's the fundamental belief behind it?

335
00:14:23.695 --> 00:14:26.173
And is that belief still valid?

336
00:14:26.173 --> 00:14:28.667
What if I didn't have that belief anymore?

337
00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:31.522
When you get how the internal structure of reality is,

338
00:14:31.522 --> 00:14:34.384
then you get a lot more empowerment to change.

339
00:14:34.384 --> 00:14:36.617
You're not just trying to change an external behavior

340
00:14:36.617 --> 00:14:38.059
which of course you can do.

341
00:14:38.059 --> 00:14:41.215
You have the core values that we all live by

342
00:14:41.215 --> 00:14:43.552
that we can work with.

343
00:14:43.552 --> 00:14:45.944
And there are different set of values for different people,

344
00:14:45.944 --> 00:14:47.445
different set of beliefs about

345
00:14:47.445 --> 00:14:49.827
what's going to be successful.

346
00:14:49.827 --> 00:14:50.997
<v Voiceover>When you work with the enneagram</v>

347
00:14:50.997 --> 00:14:52.601
you don't just work with corporations

348
00:14:52.601 --> 00:14:54.577
you work with individuals, but you also work a lot

349
00:14:54.577 --> 00:14:58.678
in family dynamics a lot between couples?

350
00:14:58.678 --> 00:14:59.630
<v ->Yes, with couples.</v>

351
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.830
<v Voiceover>And do you find it really just incredibly</v>

352
00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:06.105
useful tool in helping that dynamic shift?

353
00:15:06.105 --> 00:15:10.209
<v ->Right, it's hugely useful for one's own effectiveness</v>

354
00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:13.399
and one's own life satisfaction or one's own free energy

355
00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:15.890
in working with just ourselves.

356
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.958
But because our patterns in life is relational

357
00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:23.115
and love is the core of everything

358
00:15:23.115 --> 00:15:26.863
to be able to be free of the pattern, to be more liberated,

359
00:15:26.863 --> 00:15:29.153
to not be so confined and owned by it

360
00:15:29.153 --> 00:15:32.151
makes you a much more wonderful person to live with.

361
00:15:32.151 --> 00:15:34.865
And by my understanding with my relationships

362
00:15:34.865 --> 00:15:37.816
if we're in a closed relationship as a friendship

363
00:15:37.816 --> 00:15:40.632
my understanding your differences, your strengths

364
00:15:40.632 --> 00:15:43.539
and your challenges, I get a lot more freedom

365
00:15:43.539 --> 00:15:45.362
and understanding that you have a different

366
00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:47.972
kind of strategy for coping with life.

367
00:15:47.972 --> 00:15:51.058
We can both help each other to have more fulfilling,

368
00:15:51.058 --> 00:15:53.540
more enriched, more loving relationship.

369
00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.615
<v Voiceover>And the expectation</v>

370
00:15:54.615 --> 00:15:56.646
becomes completely different then.

371
00:15:56.646 --> 00:15:59.802
We don't have such unreal expectations with each other.

372
00:15:59.802 --> 00:16:01.782
<v ->I understand you from the inside out,</v>

373
00:16:01.782 --> 00:16:04.558
and you understand me better and we get more acceptance

374
00:16:04.558 --> 00:16:07.791
and understanding about why we have these differences.

375
00:16:07.791 --> 00:16:10.783
It's not mine are better than yours, they're just different.

376
00:16:10.783 --> 00:16:13.051
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about sort of a,</v>

377
00:16:13.051 --> 00:16:16.469
maybe a fun example you can think of in a relationship,

378
00:16:16.469 --> 00:16:19.419
in an intimate relationship between two people

379
00:16:19.419 --> 00:16:22.102
that you recall that is worth sharing.

380
00:16:23.207 --> 00:16:24.516
I know there are thousands of them.

381
00:16:24.516 --> 00:16:27.311
<v ->Me and my sweetie, we've been together over 50 years now.</v>

382
00:16:27.311 --> 00:16:29.476
And we did quite a bit of different things in work.

383
00:16:29.476 --> 00:16:32.196
When the enneagram came to us over 20 years ago

384
00:16:32.196 --> 00:16:34.344
it was like a huge light bulb went on

385
00:16:34.344 --> 00:16:36.672
because she's a mediator, her style is different,

386
00:16:36.672 --> 00:16:39.662
her pace is slower, she's steady,

387
00:16:39.662 --> 00:16:43.313
she's very outgoing and kindly toward people;

388
00:16:43.313 --> 00:16:46.656
but she had trouble staying referencing to herself

389
00:16:46.656 --> 00:16:49.233
and going like what she wanted and what she valued.

390
00:16:49.233 --> 00:16:50.986
All the while there's somebody in there

391
00:16:50.986 --> 00:16:52.973
and then sometimes you'd get upset

392
00:16:52.973 --> 00:16:55.739
that we weren't doing what she really valued.

393
00:16:55.739 --> 00:16:58.960
And I'm going like, "Well you didn't tell me."

394
00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.411
And I would at times overly question her about things

395
00:17:03.411 --> 00:17:06.032
and I could have my doubting mind come up and go like,

396
00:17:06.032 --> 00:17:09.914
"You don't love me," at times 'cause nobody's 100% loving

397
00:17:09.914 --> 00:17:12.642
and my attention would go to how she wasn't loving.

398
00:17:12.642 --> 00:17:14.317
And then she'd go, "Of course I love you,"

399
00:17:14.317 --> 00:17:16.886
and then we'd have an argument about that.

400
00:17:16.886 --> 00:17:19.826
So my understanding myself that I needed

401
00:17:19.826 --> 00:17:21.879
to see all the ways that she is loving

402
00:17:21.879 --> 00:17:24.408
and not focus on the little ways that she wasn't

403
00:17:24.408 --> 00:17:27.727
made a huge difference in my understanding of her.

404
00:17:27.727 --> 00:17:30.352
And she understood that I could get doubting of things

405
00:17:30.352 --> 00:17:33.470
and I could see all the positive things she was doing

406
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:36.107
even though her pace would be quite a bit slower

407
00:17:36.107 --> 00:17:38.620
and I could help her speak up for herself.

408
00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.151
I could cut back and say, "What's important to you,"

409
00:17:41.151 --> 00:17:44.241
and give her time to reflect on that.

410
00:17:44.241 --> 00:17:46.379
So it changed everything.

411
00:17:46.379 --> 00:17:49.031
<v Voiceover>I can see how profound that would be.</v>

412
00:17:49.031 --> 00:17:52.542
We even did our types to the extent that you can

413
00:17:52.542 --> 00:17:53.754
under short period of time.

414
00:17:53.754 --> 00:17:55.915
It wouldn't be the same as if we were,

415
00:17:55.915 --> 00:17:58.536
had months to really work with it.

416
00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:02.184
But even there I can see the value in understanding

417
00:18:02.184 --> 00:18:05.325
those things about myself or those things about Scott,

418
00:18:05.325 --> 00:18:07.942
especially where the two would have some kind

419
00:18:07.942 --> 00:18:09.534
of conflicting energies.

420
00:18:09.534 --> 00:18:11.006
<v ->Well they could be.</v>

421
00:18:11.006 --> 00:18:14.839
Classically, you as epicure, seven and Scott, I believe,

422
00:18:14.839 --> 00:18:16.759
is a one, perfectionist.

423
00:18:16.759 --> 00:18:20.220
He wants things to be understood and detailed

424
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.517
and follow a conscientious pattern

425
00:18:22.517 --> 00:18:25.578
and you can go like, "Well let's do this, let's do that."

426
00:18:25.578 --> 00:18:28.239
And he can go, "I thought we agreed to do this?

427
00:18:28.239 --> 00:18:29.726
"That was yesterday.

428
00:18:29.726 --> 00:18:32.115
"Well that day it's different," and so it could cause

429
00:18:32.115 --> 00:18:35.044
a certain amount of difficulty and conflict.

430
00:18:35.044 --> 00:18:36.728
And you could go like, "You're being rigid

431
00:18:36.728 --> 00:18:39.882
"and you're being confining.

432
00:18:39.882 --> 00:18:41.710
"Can't you be a little more flexible?"

433
00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:43.816
And he's going, "Can't you keep your agreement?

434
00:18:43.816 --> 00:18:46.173
It's what it seemed like it was supposed to be.

435
00:18:46.173 --> 00:18:47.032
<v Voiceover>You were there.</v>

436
00:18:47.032 --> 00:18:49.759
Did you have a bug in our home when we were arguing?

437
00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:50.649
(laughter)

438
00:18:50.649 --> 00:18:53.174
<v ->There's also all the positive things</v>

439
00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:54.960
that go together from it.

440
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.808
The way that you can bring kind of new life and spirit

441
00:18:57.808 --> 00:19:00.403
in the way he can bring standards and oneness

442
00:19:00.403 --> 00:19:02.182
that are harmoniously going together.

443
00:19:02.182 --> 00:19:03.866
It's lovely.

444
00:19:03.866 --> 00:19:05.176
<v Voiceover>Conscious Media Network, I think,</v>

445
00:19:05.176 --> 00:19:08.280
is a really true reflection of a lot of those traits.

446
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.681
<v ->Exactly.</v>

447
00:19:09.681 --> 00:19:13.242
<v Voiceover>It's delightful to understand.</v>

448
00:19:13.242 --> 00:19:15.485
I found it very useful even at this very early stage

449
00:19:15.485 --> 00:19:17.679
of investigation.

450
00:19:19.226 --> 00:19:20.931
Is there resistance though with people?

451
00:19:20.931 --> 00:19:23.194
Because when you're reading the typologies,

452
00:19:23.194 --> 00:19:27.737
and again this has to be a very honest self-evaluation,

453
00:19:27.737 --> 00:19:29.648
you have all the positive traits listed

454
00:19:29.648 --> 00:19:32.102
of this particular type and we are a combination

455
00:19:32.102 --> 00:19:33.696
of types, right?

456
00:19:33.696 --> 00:19:36.021
Just with primarily one really dominant one.

457
00:19:36.021 --> 00:19:37.764
<v ->There's one fundamental adaptive strategy</v>

458
00:19:37.764 --> 00:19:41.273
but if you had zero of my type and I had zero of yours

459
00:19:41.273 --> 00:19:43.499
we'd be like people from a different planet.

460
00:19:43.499 --> 00:19:46.676
So we all have some of all the types.

461
00:19:46.676 --> 00:19:48.807
And then we have this primary type

462
00:19:48.807 --> 00:19:51.365
that's our adaptive strategy and then usually

463
00:19:51.365 --> 00:19:54.751
another one or two types there's quite a bit of.

464
00:19:54.751 --> 00:19:57.140
<v Voiceover>So what happens when we're reading about,</v>

465
00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.538
we're all happy to read all the positive aspects

466
00:20:00.538 --> 00:20:01.803
or traits of our type.

467
00:20:01.803 --> 00:20:04.037
But when it gets to the negative ones,

468
00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:06.814
do you find that people tend to go into denial a bit?

469
00:20:06.814 --> 00:20:07.952
How do you deal with that?

470
00:20:07.952 --> 00:20:10.381
<v ->Well the way we deal with it we try to concentrate</v>

471
00:20:10.381 --> 00:20:12.738
on the positives first.

472
00:20:12.738 --> 00:20:14.813
(coughs) Excuse me.

473
00:20:15.826 --> 00:20:18.732
We try to deal with the positives first.

474
00:20:18.732 --> 00:20:20.641
The things that are good qualities, our strengths,

475
00:20:20.641 --> 00:20:25.177
we wanna build upon those and amplify that.

476
00:20:25.981 --> 00:20:27.739
But we all have some challenges.

477
00:20:27.739 --> 00:20:29.911
So like the little book on "The Essential Enneagram",

478
00:20:29.911 --> 00:20:33.745
by the way it's a great little book, it's inexpensive,

479
00:20:33.745 --> 00:20:36.735
it's just a little over 100 pages, it's very comprehensive

480
00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:39.463
and it has more of the practices for people to actually--

481
00:20:39.463 --> 00:20:40.158
<v Voiceover>It does.</v>

482
00:20:40.158 --> 00:20:42.113
<v ->Once you've discovered your type what do you do?</v>

483
00:20:42.113 --> 00:20:43.674
You can't just have a little bullet that says,

484
00:20:43.674 --> 00:20:46.448
"Be more thoughtful or be more aggressive,

485
00:20:46.448 --> 00:20:48.551
"or being less aggressive."

486
00:20:48.551 --> 00:20:50.708
There are actual practices that are better represented

487
00:20:50.708 --> 00:20:52.206
in this book than any other book.

488
00:20:52.206 --> 00:20:54.296
<v Voiceover>Absolutely, I mean it's a tiny little book</v>

489
00:20:54.296 --> 00:20:56.505
but there's no wasted ink in it.

490
00:20:56.505 --> 00:20:59.596
And it really would take almost a lifetime of practice

491
00:20:59.596 --> 00:21:02.260
to be able to find ourselves in complete harmony

492
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.144
with ourselves and our world.

493
00:21:04.144 --> 00:21:06.343
I mean, there's that much instructive information.

494
00:21:06.343 --> 00:21:07.513
<v ->When people, like you said,</v>

495
00:21:07.513 --> 00:21:11.002
they don't wanna be put in a box.

496
00:21:11.002 --> 00:21:14.863
And I think, like I said, it is like we're all ready,

497
00:21:14.863 --> 00:21:16.529
if I say I don't wanna be in a box

498
00:21:16.529 --> 00:21:18.415
that's already a typology.

499
00:21:18.415 --> 00:21:20.007
<v Voiceover>I was gonna say, then you got your anarchist</v>

500
00:21:20.007 --> 00:21:21.007
over it, right?

501
00:21:21.007 --> 00:21:23.015
<v ->Well the anarchist, but still the anarchist is,</v>

502
00:21:23.015 --> 00:21:25.580
I don't believe in typologies as a typology

503
00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:28.376
'cause there's people who don't believe in typologies

504
00:21:28.376 --> 00:21:31.029
and the people that do, and that's a very simplistic

505
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:32.827
and primitive typology.

506
00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:35.462
And then I like to say to people,

507
00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:38.357
"I hope you're more or less the same person every morning."

508
00:21:38.357 --> 00:21:40.624
Because if you're radically different all the time

509
00:21:40.624 --> 00:21:43.243
you got a really big grave difficulties.

510
00:21:43.243 --> 00:21:46.711
And of course most of us do recognize our partners,

511
00:21:46.711 --> 00:21:48.862
people in our lives we don't see them for a while

512
00:21:48.862 --> 00:21:52.073
and we still recognize them because we do have

513
00:21:52.073 --> 00:21:54.559
a basic fundamental structure.

514
00:21:54.559 --> 00:21:56.849
<v Voiceover>I mean, you wake up either slow and grumpy</v>

515
00:21:56.849 --> 00:22:00.156
and need a cup of coffee or raring to go.

516
00:22:00.156 --> 00:22:03.073
And so these are our typologies

517
00:22:03.073 --> 00:22:05.789
kinda playing themselves out in a very simple form

518
00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:07.898
from the time we wake up until we go to bed at night.

519
00:22:07.898 --> 00:22:08.924
<v ->Exactly.</v>

520
00:22:08.924 --> 00:22:11.547
And the whole deal about the enneagram is to understand

521
00:22:11.547 --> 00:22:14.369
the box we're in in order to get out of the box.

522
00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:17.210
It's a liberation psychology.

523
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.783
And it's a psychology, as I mentioned, that brings together

524
00:22:19.783 --> 00:22:24.655
both our psychological styles and our essential qualities

525
00:22:24.655 --> 00:22:27.992
and can bring them into integration with each other

526
00:22:27.992 --> 00:22:30.722
and a great deal of freedom and a great deal

527
00:22:30.722 --> 00:22:32.184
of more healthiness.

528
00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:33.339
<v Voiceover>Would you feel comfortable</v>

529
00:22:33.339 --> 00:22:35.069
going through the typologies for people listening

530
00:22:35.069 --> 00:22:37.115
so they can kind of identify themselves a little bit

531
00:22:37.115 --> 00:22:38.205
until we get the book?

532
00:22:38.205 --> 00:22:40.415
<v ->That's right, it's gonna be very brief</v>

533
00:22:40.415 --> 00:22:43.583
and it's a little hard to guess it all at once.

534
00:22:43.583 --> 00:22:44.572
But it's fun.

535
00:22:44.572 --> 00:22:47.326
So I'll go around starting at Type 1,

536
00:22:47.326 --> 00:22:49.389
which Scott recognize as the perfectionist.

537
00:22:49.389 --> 00:22:51.737
And the perfectionist is like in order

538
00:22:51.737 --> 00:22:55.202
to get the three basic needs for love, and for worth

539
00:22:55.202 --> 00:22:58.201
and for security met you have to be good,

540
00:22:58.201 --> 00:23:00.055
and correct and right.

541
00:23:00.055 --> 00:23:02.642
And therefore, you have a really strong inner conscience

542
00:23:02.642 --> 00:23:06.011
and you're conscientious, you can be detail-oriented,

543
00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:09.097
you're self-controlled, you're responsible

544
00:23:09.097 --> 00:23:12.966
and you can also be judgmental and kind of critical

545
00:23:12.966 --> 00:23:16.260
and dug in at times and controlling.

546
00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.804
You don't recognize that necessarily.

547
00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:24.453
That's how you're gonna get this three basic needs met.

548
00:23:24.453 --> 00:23:26.281
And the worst thing that could happen to you

549
00:23:26.281 --> 00:23:29.322
would be that you'd be so wrong, so bad

550
00:23:29.322 --> 00:23:32.289
that nobody would want you and have no worth.

551
00:23:32.289 --> 00:23:33.946
Then moving to Type 2 which leads

552
00:23:33.946 --> 00:23:35.490
with the heart center of intelligence,

553
00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:36.759
we'll come back to that.

554
00:23:36.759 --> 00:23:39.421
That's the little human gear or we call it the giver.

555
00:23:39.421 --> 00:23:42.863
It's like in order to get love, and worth and security

556
00:23:42.863 --> 00:23:44.055
you've just got to reach out

557
00:23:44.055 --> 00:23:45.841
and fulfill everybody else's needs.

558
00:23:45.841 --> 00:23:48.415
Don't pay any attention to your own then get repressed.

559
00:23:48.415 --> 00:23:50.786
You're giving, you're relationship-oriented,

560
00:23:50.786 --> 00:23:53.468
you're supportive, but you can also be intrusive,

561
00:23:53.468 --> 00:23:55.717
and over demanding at times

562
00:23:55.717 --> 00:23:59.322
and kind of hysterical even

563
00:23:59.322 --> 00:24:01.222
when you don't get your own needs met

564
00:24:01.222 --> 00:24:03.298
because they're in there in the background.

565
00:24:03.298 --> 00:24:04.983
<v Voiceover>That's kind of giving to get sometimes</v>

566
00:24:04.983 --> 00:24:05.871
at its worst.

567
00:24:05.871 --> 00:24:07.403
<v ->It's a give to get.</v>

568
00:24:07.403 --> 00:24:08.773
And the worst thing that could happen,

569
00:24:08.773 --> 00:24:11.054
if you can imagine this, is to be useless.

570
00:24:11.054 --> 00:24:12.102
Who'd want you then?

571
00:24:12.102 --> 00:24:14.785
You'd have no value whatsoever.

572
00:24:14.785 --> 00:24:17.638
No one would want you if no one needed you.

573
00:24:17.638 --> 00:24:20.729
Then moving to Type 3 which we call the performance

574
00:24:20.729 --> 00:24:24.237
like love comes through your success, your achievement,

575
00:24:24.237 --> 00:24:26.803
your accomplishment and being recognized for this.

576
00:24:26.803 --> 00:24:29.433
So you're very task-oriented, and you're focused,

577
00:24:29.433 --> 00:24:31.589
and you're efficient, and you get things done,

578
00:24:31.589 --> 00:24:33.833
and you're goal-directed but the other side of it

579
00:24:33.833 --> 00:24:37.294
is you can go too far away from your own heartfelt feelings,

580
00:24:37.294 --> 00:24:42.294
and not see relationship beyond what you do and accomplish.

581
00:24:42.427 --> 00:24:44.720
And the worst thing that could happen there would be,

582
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.538
"What if you couldn't do anything?

583
00:24:46.538 --> 00:24:47.658
You're a little human doer

584
00:24:47.658 --> 00:24:48.972
and now if you couldn't do anything

585
00:24:48.972 --> 00:24:50.351
would be like the end of life.

586
00:24:50.351 --> 00:24:51.945
You have no value.

587
00:24:51.945 --> 00:24:55.438
Then moving to Type 4 which we call the romantic,

588
00:24:55.438 --> 00:24:57.076
some people call it the individualist,

589
00:24:57.076 --> 00:25:00.606
it's like you get love and the other basic needs

590
00:25:00.606 --> 00:25:03.362
from reaching this ultimate ideal

591
00:25:03.362 --> 00:25:04.859
where there's nothing missing,

592
00:25:04.859 --> 00:25:09.121
everything we'd be wonderful, it's a deep feeling.

593
00:25:09.121 --> 00:25:12.043
And it brings this quality of authenticity,

594
00:25:12.043 --> 00:25:14.626
of deep feeling, care about relationship,

595
00:25:14.626 --> 00:25:17.088
but it can also be sort of self-absorbed,

596
00:25:17.088 --> 00:25:21.124
and overly dramatic, and too much feeling orientation,

597
00:25:21.124 --> 00:25:24.323
and feeling like something's missing or lacking

598
00:25:24.323 --> 00:25:25.636
because that's the worst thing.

599
00:25:25.636 --> 00:25:27.973
If I was deficient and lacking who would want me?

600
00:25:27.973 --> 00:25:29.645
Because I'm an ultimate idealist,

601
00:25:29.645 --> 00:25:31.047
I want the ultimate relationship

602
00:25:31.047 --> 00:25:33.451
and I look at what's missing.

603
00:25:33.451 --> 00:25:35.824
And ultimately it'll be, "What if I'm deficient?

604
00:25:35.824 --> 00:25:37.432
"Nobody would want me."

605
00:25:38.539 --> 00:25:41.128
Then moving to Type 5 which leads with the mental centers

606
00:25:41.128 --> 00:25:42.836
the 6 and 7.

607
00:25:42.836 --> 00:25:46.018
Type 5 we call the observer or sometimes called the thinker,

608
00:25:46.018 --> 00:25:48.099
and it's like well in a world that comes in

609
00:25:48.099 --> 00:25:50.438
and intrudes too much it takes too much energy

610
00:25:50.438 --> 00:25:52.361
or doesn't give you enough,

611
00:25:52.361 --> 00:25:54.346
you've got to learn to be self-sufficient.

612
00:25:54.346 --> 00:25:57.132
You got to learn to disconnect and go up into your head

613
00:25:57.132 --> 00:25:59.360
and figure out life for yourself.

614
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.111
Not have too many needs and wants

615
00:26:01.111 --> 00:26:03.215
and not to be intrusive on anyone.

616
00:26:03.215 --> 00:26:05.588
Now the downside of that would be,

617
00:26:05.588 --> 00:26:08.367
well, you'd be too withholding or withdrawn,

618
00:26:08.367 --> 00:26:11.958
or too private and not outreaching enough

619
00:26:11.958 --> 00:26:14.138
that you don't want people to come in and deplete you,

620
00:26:14.138 --> 00:26:15.890
would be the worst thing underneath

621
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.544
It would be what if you got depleted by people?

622
00:26:19.544 --> 00:26:22.426
So that's its strategy is to get independence

623
00:26:22.426 --> 00:26:24.680
and self-sufficiency.

624
00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.694
Six, we've already talked about it a little bit.

625
00:26:26.694 --> 00:26:29.694
It's like you've lost the sense of faith in the world,

626
00:26:29.694 --> 00:26:32.075
in yourself, in your childhood experience,

627
00:26:32.075 --> 00:26:34.140
mine, I certainly corroborated that.

628
00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:37.360
For example, I was allergic to milk as an infant--

629
00:26:38.935 --> 00:26:40.093
I'll back track.

630
00:26:40.093 --> 00:26:42.242
My mother had childbed fever,

631
00:26:42.242 --> 00:26:44.160
before antibiotics she almost died.

632
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.064
You can imagine everybody in the family is fearful.

633
00:26:47.064 --> 00:26:49.713
And then when she came back she couldn't breastfeed

634
00:26:49.713 --> 00:26:52.355
so I was always put on milk, but I was allergic to milk

635
00:26:52.355 --> 00:26:53.758
and didn't grow.

636
00:26:53.758 --> 00:26:56.330
You can't even trust what's gonna come in your mouth.

637
00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:59.185
And I think they're all frightened that I was gonna die.

638
00:26:59.185 --> 00:27:02.225
Until they discovered soybean, I kinda grew

639
00:27:02.225 --> 00:27:03.651
and then I started to flourish

640
00:27:03.651 --> 00:27:06.557
but that wasn't until three to four months of age.

641
00:27:06.557 --> 00:27:08.426
And so then I think everybody was relieved,

642
00:27:08.426 --> 00:27:11.280
it's like I couldn't trust and count on anything

643
00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.871
that would come into my mouth.

644
00:27:12.871 --> 00:27:14.236
Well the world could be predictable.

645
00:27:14.236 --> 00:27:17.665
I think that contributed some to my type.

646
00:27:17.665 --> 00:27:20.853
My father was also a six, genetics are there

647
00:27:20.853 --> 00:27:24.032
and they just conspired together.

648
00:27:24.032 --> 00:27:25.763
So the qualities of better good are

649
00:27:25.763 --> 00:27:27.895
like you yourself are gonna be faithful

650
00:27:27.895 --> 00:27:29.275
and you're gonna be loyal

651
00:27:29.275 --> 00:27:31.067
and you're going to be a good problem solver

652
00:27:31.067 --> 00:27:33.127
and you're gonna see what could go wrong and correct it.

653
00:27:33.127 --> 00:27:35.810
But on the other side of that you can be too doubtful,

654
00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:38.765
too questioning, too suspicious,

655
00:27:38.765 --> 00:27:40.948
too seeing all the things that could go wrong,

656
00:27:40.948 --> 00:27:43.674
be a kind of stick in the mud.

657
00:27:43.674 --> 00:27:48.132
So now moving to Type 7 which is the,

658
00:27:48.132 --> 00:27:50.128
we call it the epicure or the adventurer.

659
00:27:50.128 --> 00:27:52.576
It's like, "Well the way you get security

660
00:27:52.576 --> 00:27:54.499
"is to keep life up and flowing.

661
00:27:54.499 --> 00:27:57.769
"And just have a wonderful attitude about anything can go.

662
00:27:57.769 --> 00:27:59.924
"You can always see the positives."

663
00:27:59.924 --> 00:28:01.282
"You can plan for pleasurable

664
00:28:01.282 --> 00:28:03.622
"positive possibilities all the time."

665
00:28:03.622 --> 00:28:04.745
And it's wonderful.

666
00:28:04.745 --> 00:28:07.029
You're adventurous, you're positive,

667
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:10.166
you can see all the options and opportunities.

668
00:28:10.166 --> 00:28:13.015
On the downside, you can get a little bit self-absorbed

669
00:28:13.015 --> 00:28:16.591
with your own plans and not see what other people

670
00:28:16.591 --> 00:28:20.582
might have and not look at what could go wrong.

671
00:28:20.582 --> 00:28:23.425
The downside, in order to feel joy

672
00:28:23.425 --> 00:28:25.669
you also have to be able to feel sorrow.

673
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:26.950
And if you don't wanna go to sorrow

674
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:29.648
you're limiting yourself, you don't wanna be limited.

675
00:28:29.648 --> 00:28:32.759
The worst thing for the 7 would be to be ultimately limited

676
00:28:32.759 --> 00:28:34.682
so you're the sick into suffering.

677
00:28:34.682 --> 00:28:37.180
You wanna keep life up and if you couldn't do that

678
00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.631
it would be like that would be the horror,

679
00:28:38.631 --> 00:28:41.650
would be the sick and the suffering.

680
00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:43.835
And then 8, we're almost through,

681
00:28:43.835 --> 00:28:46.129
and we're coming back to the types of lead

682
00:28:46.129 --> 00:28:49.408
with the gut center or the body center of intelligence.

683
00:28:49.408 --> 00:28:51.844
The aid, we call it the protector,

684
00:28:51.844 --> 00:28:54.228
sometimes call the asserter and it's like,

685
00:28:54.228 --> 00:28:56.455
"It's a hard tough world

686
00:28:56.455 --> 00:28:58.863
"where people can take advantage of you.

687
00:28:58.863 --> 00:29:01.461
"And you got to use your own big energy

688
00:29:01.461 --> 00:29:04.624
"to not be controlled and to assert your own self."

689
00:29:04.624 --> 00:29:07.932
And you have a big energy, you can be powerful,

690
00:29:07.932 --> 00:29:11.255
you can be direct, pursue your own sense of truth

691
00:29:11.255 --> 00:29:15.954
and justice, you just go for it, it's kinda all or nothing.

692
00:29:15.954 --> 00:29:17.744
Well the downside of that is sometimes

693
00:29:17.744 --> 00:29:19.902
it's like you don't see anybody else's truth

694
00:29:19.902 --> 00:29:23.185
and you have this big energy and you can be over impactful.

695
00:29:23.185 --> 00:29:26.092
And so you need to learn to be able to be

696
00:29:26.092 --> 00:29:28.988
like more spacious, take in other people's truth,

697
00:29:28.988 --> 00:29:31.403
watch for your impactfulness.

698
00:29:31.403 --> 00:29:33.481
So the downside it can be over impactful,

699
00:29:33.481 --> 00:29:37.774
over intrusive to others and you just need

700
00:29:37.774 --> 00:29:39.801
to learn to be able to back off

701
00:29:39.801 --> 00:29:42.725
and to hear other people's point of view.

702
00:29:43.826 --> 00:29:47.381
Now lastly, Type 9, which I mentioned my sweetheart,

703
00:29:47.381 --> 00:29:51.267
the mediator is like, "Well you just got to blend in,

704
00:29:51.267 --> 00:29:52.848
"you just got to go along and get along.

705
00:29:52.848 --> 00:29:55.057
"Don't make a big deal of yourself."

706
00:29:55.057 --> 00:29:56.651
It's a wonderful strategy.

707
00:29:56.651 --> 00:29:58.660
You don't have too big an agenda,

708
00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:03.660
you're very kindly, you're not too demanding,

709
00:30:04.137 --> 00:30:07.429
you're very steady, you're very reliable.

710
00:30:07.429 --> 00:30:09.262
The downside of it can be:

711
00:30:09.262 --> 00:30:10.713
well you can dig in and get stubborn

712
00:30:10.713 --> 00:30:12.529
'cause there's somebody in there,

713
00:30:12.529 --> 00:30:14.409
you can get kind of resistant,

714
00:30:14.409 --> 00:30:17.175
and you don't tell people what you really aren't able

715
00:30:17.175 --> 00:30:19.541
to tell on what you really think, and feel, and need

716
00:30:19.541 --> 00:30:21.899
because you're not paying any attention to that.

717
00:30:21.899 --> 00:30:24.315
So like all the type you have positives

718
00:30:24.315 --> 00:30:26.623
and you have negatives and the whole path

719
00:30:26.623 --> 00:30:29.038
is the path to liberation.

720
00:30:29.038 --> 00:30:30.402
<v Voiceover>Well thank you for that.</v>

721
00:30:30.402 --> 00:30:32.615
I hope everybody had fun listening to this

722
00:30:32.615 --> 00:30:34.481
because they can kinda see a little bit already

723
00:30:34.481 --> 00:30:37.329
of themselves and probably two or three of those.

724
00:30:37.329 --> 00:30:39.728
But let's talk about what happens as you go through life

725
00:30:39.728 --> 00:30:42.717
and say you actually mature and you consciously

726
00:30:42.717 --> 00:30:44.834
start working on the more negative ends

727
00:30:44.834 --> 00:30:47.444
and moving toward the more positive,

728
00:30:47.444 --> 00:30:50.485
maybe even the complementary typologies.

729
00:30:50.485 --> 00:30:54.608
Do you actually shift your basic typology in a lot of time?

730
00:30:54.608 --> 00:30:56.340
<v ->No, that's pretty wired in.</v>

731
00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:59.194
One of the things that's remarkable about the enneagram

732
00:30:59.194 --> 00:31:01.346
it's a life spanned typology.

733
00:31:01.346 --> 00:31:04.374
It isn't like you're this and then you change to this,

734
00:31:04.374 --> 00:31:06.569
and then you change to that.

735
00:31:06.569 --> 00:31:11.011
So that fundamental adaptive strategy is there

736
00:31:11.011 --> 00:31:13.043
but you can get less and less owned by,

737
00:31:13.043 --> 00:31:16.780
more liberated, more free and you can develop within that.

738
00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:19.830
So for instance a six, myself, that can be

739
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:24.830
in a very undeveloped state suspicious, questioning--

740
00:31:24.877 --> 00:31:26.034
<v Voiceover>Even paranoid huh?</v>

741
00:31:26.034 --> 00:31:27.872
<v ->Even paranoid.</v>

742
00:31:27.872 --> 00:31:32.838
Mistrusting, accusatory, always seeing what could go wrong

743
00:31:32.838 --> 00:31:36.204
can develop to very high level of kind of trust,

744
00:31:36.204 --> 00:31:38.449
and faith in self and the others,

745
00:31:38.449 --> 00:31:41.637
believing in all the things that can happen is positive,

746
00:31:41.637 --> 00:31:43.580
see the world in much more positive frame

747
00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:45.755
while still having that ability to be discerning

748
00:31:45.755 --> 00:31:47.575
in solving problems.

749
00:31:47.575 --> 00:31:49.783
So you can have a huge range of development

750
00:31:49.783 --> 00:31:53.199
with inside your type but also it's like,

751
00:31:53.199 --> 00:31:56.460
not just enlarging the box but getting out of the box too

752
00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.699
so that you have more flexibility,

753
00:31:58.699 --> 00:32:02.468
more adaptability and so forth in your life.

754
00:32:02.468 --> 00:32:06.351
<v Voiceover>Does this extend to say corporations,</v>

755
00:32:06.351 --> 00:32:09.495
can a corporation have kind of an overlay,

756
00:32:09.495 --> 00:32:11.366
an enneugram overlay, in their own?

757
00:32:11.366 --> 00:32:12.257
<v ->Definitely.</v>

758
00:32:12.257 --> 00:32:16.050
The leadership of a corporation often reflects

759
00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:20.121
the personality style of its leaders or founders.

760
00:32:21.451 --> 00:32:22.976
And so if you're having a merger

761
00:32:22.976 --> 00:32:24.720
and you got this culture over here and that culture

762
00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.190
that's why lots of times big mergers don't work very well

763
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:28.978
because you have a clash of cultures

764
00:32:28.978 --> 00:32:32.474
based upon the fundamental structure of their leadership.

765
00:32:32.474 --> 00:32:33.850
<v Voiceover>The corporation you were talking about</v>

766
00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:38.691
a while ago which I believe was a retail chain of some kind.

767
00:32:38.691 --> 00:32:42.024
And you were talking about these kind of charge ahead

768
00:32:42.024 --> 00:32:43.904
forces at the top.

769
00:32:43.904 --> 00:32:46.021
I think it was the 3, 7 and 8.

770
00:32:48.523 --> 00:32:50.764
<v ->In other words the performer, the epicure</v>

771
00:32:50.764 --> 00:32:54.224
and the asserter are all positive move ahead.

772
00:32:54.224 --> 00:32:57.974
<v Voiceover>Does that often reflect the type of business,</v>

773
00:32:57.974 --> 00:33:00.438
I mean, for example, if you had

774
00:33:00.438 --> 00:33:03.586
say a financial banking institution

775
00:33:03.586 --> 00:33:05.738
might you find more of an enneugram overlay

776
00:33:05.738 --> 00:33:08.346
that might be more cautious, more of a six, for example?

777
00:33:08.346 --> 00:33:10.732
Do you find it does reflect the type of business at all?

778
00:33:10.732 --> 00:33:13.601
<v ->No, apparently in modern banking in the United States.</v>

779
00:33:13.601 --> 00:33:14.952
<v Voiceover>Yeah, I can see there's a little bit of</v>

780
00:33:14.952 --> 00:33:16.761
risk taking going on.

781
00:33:16.761 --> 00:33:18.402
We'll get into that in a moment.

782
00:33:18.402 --> 00:33:20.737
And that's called greed and I wanna talk to you about that.

783
00:33:20.737 --> 00:33:23.031
But you know what I'm saying--

784
00:33:23.031 --> 00:33:25.670
<v ->I think it depends.</v>

785
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:28.288
In anything, if you were to say it's ultimate research

786
00:33:28.288 --> 00:33:31.460
you're gonna find more of the observer type there

787
00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.484
when you're rested in knowledge and maybe more

788
00:33:33.484 --> 00:33:36.126
generally the people that lead with the mental type,

789
00:33:36.126 --> 00:33:38.622
more conscientious, sort of people like the 1s

790
00:33:38.622 --> 00:33:41.541
that wanna get to the right answer to things and so forth.

791
00:33:41.541 --> 00:33:44.535
But in any one industry you're gonna have all nine types.

792
00:33:44.535 --> 00:33:46.835
You just won't have an even distribution

793
00:33:46.835 --> 00:33:49.788
and the types are pretty evenly distributed.

794
00:33:50.849 --> 00:33:51.974
<v Voiceover>What about greed?</v>

795
00:33:51.974 --> 00:33:55.298
We talked about this, we touched on it off camera.

796
00:33:55.298 --> 00:33:59.692
<v ->Well greed, I believe, we did in fact a presentation</v>

797
00:33:59.692 --> 00:34:04.066
on the enneagram styles and how they're related to greed,

798
00:34:04.066 --> 00:34:06.202
that there's two fundamental things about greed.

799
00:34:06.202 --> 00:34:09.191
One is that there's an inner sense of lack.

800
00:34:09.191 --> 00:34:12.515
When we lose touch with,

801
00:34:12.515 --> 00:34:13.817
when they go into the background

802
00:34:13.817 --> 00:34:16.306
our higher essential qualities our spiritual qualities

803
00:34:16.306 --> 00:34:19.037
whether it's faith, whether it's love, whether it's hope,

804
00:34:19.037 --> 00:34:21.376
whatever the qualities are we're disconnected

805
00:34:21.376 --> 00:34:25.134
from that kind of core sense of being at one with ourselves

806
00:34:25.134 --> 00:34:28.833
and of being in our higher essential self.

807
00:34:28.833 --> 00:34:30.840
I think that's a kinda inner lack that makes us

808
00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.839
go out in the world to try to create something,

809
00:34:32.839 --> 00:34:35.055
to fulfill that, to get that back.

810
00:34:35.055 --> 00:34:36.089
<v Voiceover>To put value in.</v>

811
00:34:36.089 --> 00:34:39.202
<v ->To put value in for that inner sense of lack</v>

812
00:34:39.202 --> 00:34:40.718
that's going on.

813
00:34:40.718 --> 00:34:42.869
Plus, there's this outer sense of deficiency,

814
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:46.597
or outer sense of lack that I think was back in our biology.

815
00:34:46.597 --> 00:34:50.718
When it came out of Africa 50, 75,000 years ago,

816
00:34:50.718 --> 00:34:53.261
so it is like you never get enough,

817
00:34:53.261 --> 00:34:54.900
how can you be assured that you're gonna have

818
00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.675
enough external supply?

819
00:34:56.675 --> 00:34:58.150
So there's like an inner lack

820
00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:00.512
and an external lack psychologically

821
00:35:00.512 --> 00:35:03.365
that can combine together to create greed.

822
00:35:03.365 --> 00:35:05.133
<v Voiceover>i.e. The situation we're now dealing with</v>

823
00:35:05.133 --> 00:35:06.132
on Wall Street.

824
00:35:06.132 --> 00:35:08.437
And it took an incredible lack,

825
00:35:08.437 --> 00:35:10.411
of feeling of an incredible lack

826
00:35:10.411 --> 00:35:11.770
to have created such horrific--

827
00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:13.549
<v ->Incredible lack, the inner deficiency</v>

828
00:35:13.549 --> 00:35:15.655
and the fear of outer deficiency.

829
00:35:15.655 --> 00:35:16.798
<v Voiceover>So really what happened there</v>

830
00:35:16.798 --> 00:35:17.926
was totally fear-based?

831
00:35:17.926 --> 00:35:18.693
<v ->Yes, that's it.</v>

832
00:35:18.693 --> 00:35:20.178
<v Voiceover>It is fear-based when these things happen?</v>

833
00:35:20.178 --> 00:35:21.194
<v ->Ultimately.</v>

834
00:35:21.194 --> 00:35:23.251
Although they may not experience the fear

835
00:35:23.251 --> 00:35:24.753
when you're out there doing it

836
00:35:24.753 --> 00:35:27.552
and you're making your millions of dollars of bonus,

837
00:35:27.552 --> 00:35:30.605
you don't have the fear at that moment.

838
00:35:32.138 --> 00:35:34.009
<v Voiceover>Can you extend this out even further</v>

839
00:35:34.009 --> 00:35:36.257
to cultures or countries?

840
00:35:37.517 --> 00:35:39.996
<v ->Countries do have cultural overlays</v>

841
00:35:39.996 --> 00:35:41.498
and then all the types are there.

842
00:35:41.498 --> 00:35:44.450
And I was in Brazil, we think it's got

843
00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:46.960
a kind of epicurean overlay there,

844
00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:50.106
the sort of basic positive energy that's there.

845
00:35:50.106 --> 00:35:51.698
But underneath were all the types

846
00:35:51.698 --> 00:35:55.133
and we're doing our training, it could very deep

847
00:35:55.133 --> 00:35:57.780
in the high point just bouncing on the surface of life

848
00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.188
but they had an overlay of a kind of epicurean

849
00:36:00.188 --> 00:36:03.057
or adventurer, Type 7.

850
00:36:03.057 --> 00:36:04.931
<v Voiceover>A lot of pleasure seeking in terms</v>

851
00:36:04.931 --> 00:36:06.581
of just the really simplistic.

852
00:36:06.581 --> 00:36:09.763
<v ->In contrast, in Finland, people are much more reserved.</v>

853
00:36:09.763 --> 00:36:14.164
I think the culture could be 5 type, observer type.

854
00:36:14.164 --> 00:36:16.366
People were more contained.

855
00:36:16.366 --> 00:36:19.907
But underneath are all nine of the types out there.

856
00:36:19.907 --> 00:36:21.510
<v Voiceover>What about the US?</v>

857
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:24.592
<v ->Well the US, I believe, has been the performer</v>

858
00:36:24.592 --> 00:36:26.588
or the go-getter or the accomplished.

859
00:36:26.588 --> 00:36:29.244
Just go do it, succeed at any cost.

860
00:36:29.244 --> 00:36:30.685
That's what Wall Street was doing,

861
00:36:30.685 --> 00:36:32.881
that's what our athlete's do.

862
00:36:32.881 --> 00:36:37.881
It's like success, win, compete, get ahead, accomplish, do.

863
00:36:38.306 --> 00:36:41.459
I mean, let's just go do it sort of overlay.

864
00:36:41.459 --> 00:36:43.639
And then more recently, maybe it's been influenced

865
00:36:43.639 --> 00:36:46.838
by a more six-like things since 9/11 at least.

866
00:36:46.838 --> 00:36:50.563
We're more concerned about all the things that could happen,

867
00:36:50.563 --> 00:36:52.438
how the enemies might come in

868
00:36:52.438 --> 00:36:54.666
and we get preoccupied with that.

869
00:36:56.067 --> 00:36:57.958
One thing I wanna come back to though,

870
00:36:57.958 --> 00:36:59.973
and I've alluded to it a little bit,

871
00:36:59.973 --> 00:37:04.089
is how our neurobiology and the enneagram

872
00:37:04.089 --> 00:37:08.970
it's so congruent and it gives validity to the enneagram.

873
00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:11.221
<v Voiceover>And this is kind of spilling over into work</v>

874
00:37:11.221 --> 00:37:12.808
such as Bruce Lipton's.

875
00:37:12.808 --> 00:37:14.647
<v ->Yes, right.</v>

876
00:37:14.647 --> 00:37:19.647
Some of the fundamental work of neurobiology now,

877
00:37:19.902 --> 00:37:23.466
for instance, literally, the neurons operate.

878
00:37:23.466 --> 00:37:28.321
according to the interwoven flow of information and energy.

879
00:37:29.503 --> 00:37:31.538
Literally, the pattern of interwoven flow

880
00:37:31.538 --> 00:37:35.841
of information and energy, the pattern of information

881
00:37:35.841 --> 00:37:37.717
is our habit of mind.

882
00:37:37.717 --> 00:37:41.396
What you see, what you experience, what you don't.

883
00:37:41.396 --> 00:37:44.337
And the energy is kind of the driving emotion underneath it

884
00:37:44.337 --> 00:37:46.864
and that's the way our neurons operate.

885
00:37:46.864 --> 00:37:49.574
So this combination of the driving emotion

886
00:37:49.574 --> 00:37:53.085
underneath our type, like my type of fear underneath it

887
00:37:53.085 --> 00:37:55.378
because you can't trust the world,

888
00:37:55.378 --> 00:37:58.626
how that drives and interconnects with the habit

889
00:37:58.626 --> 00:38:01.371
of attention to form our personality pattern.

890
00:38:01.371 --> 00:38:03.074
That's the way our neurons operate

891
00:38:03.074 --> 00:38:05.023
according to this interwoven pattern

892
00:38:05.023 --> 00:38:07.115
of the flow of information and energy.

893
00:38:07.984 --> 00:38:09.810
<v Voiceover>Neurons that fire together wire together.</v>

894
00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:11.227
<v ->That's another piece.</v>

895
00:38:11.227 --> 00:38:12.678
They fire together and wire together,

896
00:38:12.678 --> 00:38:14.545
also that's the hope.

897
00:38:14.545 --> 00:38:18.496
Because we have neuroplasticity, we can work

898
00:38:18.496 --> 00:38:21.573
at getting new arrangements of neurons firing

899
00:38:21.573 --> 00:38:23.255
and wiring together.

900
00:38:23.255 --> 00:38:26.831
So we don't have to be owned by the pattern in perpetuity.

901
00:38:26.831 --> 00:38:30.008
We can develop and release ourselves from the pattern

902
00:38:30.008 --> 00:38:32.150
and expand the pattern.

903
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:33.464
<v Voiceover>What's interesting in this book too,</v>

904
00:38:33.464 --> 00:38:38.464
as you spoke about a bit ago, is that it really does have

905
00:38:39.126 --> 00:38:42.170
a spiritual overlay to it.

906
00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:44.498
And when you look at each of the typologies

907
00:38:44.498 --> 00:38:49.257
and the various belief systems that we have lost sight of,

908
00:38:49.257 --> 00:38:50.886
I think it even starts out with that,

909
00:38:50.886 --> 00:38:54.887
the belief that I have lost sight of as a particular type.

910
00:38:54.887 --> 00:38:58.945
You're starting with a fairly deep dialogue to begin with

911
00:38:58.945 --> 00:39:00.305
and all the ways true.

912
00:39:00.305 --> 00:39:01.757
<v ->That's the huge wake up call,</v>

913
00:39:01.757 --> 00:39:04.215
I mean, everybody doesn't think like me.

914
00:39:05.629 --> 00:39:09.432
Before we wake up at all it's like, "My way is the way."

915
00:39:09.432 --> 00:39:11.165
Like, "You got a different way?

916
00:39:11.165 --> 00:39:13.082
"I thought you thought just like me."

917
00:39:13.082 --> 00:39:15.014
That's a huge wake up call.

918
00:39:15.014 --> 00:39:16.651
<v Voiceover>And that really is what leads</v>

919
00:39:16.651 --> 00:39:17.997
to most conflict.

920
00:39:17.997 --> 00:39:20.072
And you work a lot with conflict resolution.

921
00:39:20.072 --> 00:39:21.443
<v ->Exactly, exactly.</v>

922
00:39:21.443 --> 00:39:25.744
<v Voiceover>What kind of arenas in which you do this?</v>

923
00:39:25.744 --> 00:39:29.887
<v ->Well conflict can be obviously with relationship,</v>

924
00:39:29.887 --> 00:39:34.647
within families but conflict in extent to countries--

925
00:39:34.647 --> 00:39:35.703
<v Voiceover>That's what I was wondering,</v>

926
00:39:35.703 --> 00:39:37.051
I was working toward.

927
00:39:37.051 --> 00:39:39.195
<v ->I think there's a hope in the future for the enneagram</v>

928
00:39:39.195 --> 00:39:41.904
to bring its knowledge when we understand,

929
00:39:41.904 --> 00:39:45.709
if you're Israeli and I'm Palestinian that underneath

930
00:39:45.709 --> 00:39:48.231
we have these similar type structures that own us,

931
00:39:48.231 --> 00:39:51.695
we could start to work on a greater understanding.

932
00:39:53.301 --> 00:39:55.079
And the enneagram brings, and I'll come back to this

933
00:39:55.079 --> 00:39:57.239
when I talk a little bit about what we call

934
00:39:57.239 --> 00:40:01.342
the universal growth process for self mastery

935
00:40:01.342 --> 00:40:03.744
that we use in the enneagram, as part of the enneagram,

936
00:40:03.744 --> 00:40:05.408
I'll come back to that.

937
00:40:05.408 --> 00:40:08.244
But it can be everything from interpersonal conflict

938
00:40:08.244 --> 00:40:11.987
in relationship all the way to international conflict,

939
00:40:11.987 --> 00:40:13.228
and how we can work with that

940
00:40:13.228 --> 00:40:15.926
and how our personality styles get into that.

941
00:40:15.926 --> 00:40:17.335
<v Voiceover>Well let's go ahead and go into it then.</v>

942
00:40:17.335 --> 00:40:19.410
<v ->Oh I wanna finish the neurobiology a little bit.</v>

943
00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:21.077
I just got two other things here.

944
00:40:21.077 --> 00:40:24.579
One is the brain again is literally a pattern machine,

945
00:40:24.579 --> 00:40:26.633
that's the way our brains operate.

946
00:40:26.633 --> 00:40:29.116
We have what are called invariant representations,

947
00:40:29.116 --> 00:40:31.277
it's a little bit strong term.

948
00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.747
We have one for door knobs.

949
00:40:33.747 --> 00:40:35.884
Imagine in the United States, if you didn't have

950
00:40:35.884 --> 00:40:39.126
a representation for door knobs

951
00:40:39.126 --> 00:40:41.008
you couldn't get around the next day.

952
00:40:41.008 --> 00:40:42.179
You would come to these things

953
00:40:42.179 --> 00:40:43.539
and you wouldn't know what to do.

954
00:40:43.539 --> 00:40:45.509
<v Voiceover>You'll be pulling on them or--</v>

955
00:40:45.509 --> 00:40:48.388
<v ->Now of course these invariant representations</v>

956
00:40:48.388 --> 00:40:50.566
for this category gets changed because there's lots

957
00:40:50.566 --> 00:40:51.879
of different kinds of door knobs.

958
00:40:51.879 --> 00:40:54.410
So we do receive new input that modifies it

959
00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:57.118
but there's always this representation.

960
00:40:57.118 --> 00:40:58.951
Staircases.

961
00:40:58.951 --> 00:41:01.709
Where your stuff is in the kitchen and somebody changed

962
00:41:01.709 --> 00:41:06.044
the drawers all around overnight you'd be really upset.

963
00:41:06.044 --> 00:41:07.023
<v Voiceover>Very upsetting.</v>

964
00:41:07.023 --> 00:41:08.635
<v ->So literally the brain is a pattern machine</v>

965
00:41:08.635 --> 00:41:10.405
and there's more neurons coming down

966
00:41:10.405 --> 00:41:13.970
to regulate the input that's coming up

967
00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:16.472
and there is input coming up itself.

968
00:41:16.472 --> 00:41:18.439
Remember, there's a hundred billion neurons

969
00:41:18.439 --> 00:41:21.668
and lots, lots more dendrites and interconnections

970
00:41:21.668 --> 00:41:23.678
and that's regulating what can come in.

971
00:41:23.678 --> 00:41:26.399
So the brain is a pattern machine.

972
00:41:26.399 --> 00:41:29.015
The third thing I wanna mention,

973
00:41:29.015 --> 00:41:31.219
how the enneagram is validated

974
00:41:31.219 --> 00:41:35.141
is that all mammals: rats, everything

975
00:41:35.141 --> 00:41:38.843
have three basic aversive emotions.

976
00:41:38.843 --> 00:41:42.483
And these emotions, although aversive or positive,

977
00:41:42.483 --> 00:41:45.470
one is fear and the three types that lead

978
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:47.689
with the mental center of intelligence is about fear,

979
00:41:47.689 --> 00:41:49.047
"How do I make a secure world?

980
00:41:49.047 --> 00:41:50.450
"How can I be seen in the world?

981
00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:51.763
"How do I figure it out?"

982
00:41:51.763 --> 00:41:53.210
Five, six and seven.

983
00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:56.206
"How do I figure out the world to make it secure?"

984
00:41:56.206 --> 00:41:57.986
One of the three basic needs.

985
00:41:57.986 --> 00:41:59.929
And fear drives that underneath.

986
00:41:59.929 --> 00:42:02.178
They don't wanna have fear.

987
00:42:02.178 --> 00:42:06.609
The second aversive emotion that all mammals have is anger.

988
00:42:06.609 --> 00:42:09.420
And that's like, "I'm not getting what I want."

989
00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:10.959
<v Voiceover>And which numbers are they?</v>

990
00:42:10.959 --> 00:42:12.760
<v ->That's the 8, 9 and 1.</v>

991
00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.659
They got energy like,

992
00:42:14.659 --> 00:42:15.898
"The world isn't the way it ought to be.

993
00:42:15.898 --> 00:42:17.745
"You're not giving me what I want and I want them.

994
00:42:17.745 --> 00:42:18.724
"I'm angry."

995
00:42:18.724 --> 00:42:21.470
"And I don't wanna be angry but I wanna get what I want.

996
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:23.200
"I wanna be valued in the world.

997
00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.137
"You don't value me?

998
00:42:25.137 --> 00:42:28.630
"The world isn't the way it ought be from my stand point,

999
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:30.382
"I'm gonna get angry.

1000
00:42:30.382 --> 00:42:32.580
"And I don't wanna be angry, but I wanna have worth,

1001
00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.544
"I wanna have what I want."

1002
00:42:34.544 --> 00:42:38.197
And then the last aversive emotion is called panic

1003
00:42:38.197 --> 00:42:40.740
in the mammalian thing,

1004
00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:43.594
or distress when you don't have connection.

1005
00:42:43.594 --> 00:42:45.546
Those are the types 2, 3 and 4

1006
00:42:45.546 --> 00:42:47.391
that lead with the heart center.

1007
00:42:47.391 --> 00:42:49.216
It's so vital to have connection.

1008
00:42:49.216 --> 00:42:51.998
And when I lose connection I have distress,

1009
00:42:51.998 --> 00:42:56.063
I have sadness, and I can even have panic like a little kid

1010
00:42:56.063 --> 00:42:57.997
lost in the department store.

1011
00:42:57.997 --> 00:42:59.666
You see a little four-year-old child

1012
00:42:59.666 --> 00:43:02.192
and they're in panic and distress.

1013
00:43:02.192 --> 00:43:03.640
And so we don't wanna have that.

1014
00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.172
We want connection, we want love in our lives.

1015
00:43:06.172 --> 00:43:08.699
So in order to have love, to have security,

1016
00:43:08.699 --> 00:43:10.741
to get what we want we have these three centers

1017
00:43:10.741 --> 00:43:14.059
of intelligence, and these three emotions,

1018
00:43:14.059 --> 00:43:17.246
aversive emotions, and those three basic needs

1019
00:43:17.246 --> 00:43:19.412
are shared by all the mammals on the planet.

1020
00:43:19.412 --> 00:43:22.020
That gives the enneagram validity.

1021
00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.064
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

1022
00:43:23.064 --> 00:43:25.655
It was going to the universal concept

1023
00:43:25.655 --> 00:43:27.434
you were going to go into a moment ago.

1024
00:43:27.434 --> 00:43:28.942
So we'll get back to that.

1025
00:43:28.942 --> 00:43:31.630
<v ->The enneagram is universal.</v>

1026
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:34.390
The way we teach and the way we feel

1027
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:36.263
that the process of human development

1028
00:43:36.263 --> 00:43:38.320
can best be served is what we call

1029
00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:41.833
the universal growth process for self mastery.

1030
00:43:41.833 --> 00:43:43.845
And it involves four A's.

1031
00:43:43.845 --> 00:43:47.543
And four A's are something that anybody can remember.

1032
00:43:47.543 --> 00:43:51.022
Anybody go into business and people can remember four A's,

1033
00:43:51.022 --> 00:43:54.958
or even teenagers or children can even think of four A's.

1034
00:43:54.958 --> 00:43:57.496
The first A is called awareness.

1035
00:43:57.496 --> 00:43:59.776
And by awareness it means like being able

1036
00:43:59.776 --> 00:44:04.776
to be present, to be grounded, to be receptive.

1037
00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:08.067
And by practicing, whether it's centering prayer

1038
00:44:08.067 --> 00:44:10.822
in the Christian tradition, or whether it's meditation,

1039
00:44:10.822 --> 00:44:13.458
whether breath practice, where you can come down

1040
00:44:13.458 --> 00:44:16.711
and ground yourself from practice, and get more receptive

1041
00:44:16.711 --> 00:44:20.531
and be more grounded that's huge.

1042
00:44:20.531 --> 00:44:25.075
So if I'm receptive to you, if I'm not all full of myself

1043
00:44:25.075 --> 00:44:26.260
you're gonna feel like,

1044
00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:28.535
"Hey, maybe he's pretty empathetic even."

1045
00:44:28.535 --> 00:44:30.973
The second one is called acceptance.

1046
00:44:30.973 --> 00:44:34.501
And by acceptance it simply means non-judment.

1047
00:44:34.501 --> 00:44:36.088
"Yeah, I accept you as you are,"

1048
00:44:36.088 --> 00:44:37.637
now that doesn't mean I agree with you

1049
00:44:37.637 --> 00:44:39.927
or I condone everything or I capitulate,

1050
00:44:39.927 --> 00:44:43.403
but it means that I come with whatever disturbance I have

1051
00:44:43.403 --> 00:44:45.603
without judgment about you.

1052
00:44:45.603 --> 00:44:48.688
I represent assertively what I value with you.

1053
00:44:48.688 --> 00:44:51.063
Now when you combine those two together,

1054
00:44:51.063 --> 00:44:54.852
the first two A's of awareness and acceptance,

1055
00:44:54.852 --> 00:44:58.032
you have truly what we call empathy and compassion

1056
00:44:58.032 --> 00:44:59.219
when people have that.

1057
00:44:59.219 --> 00:45:00.707
And it's huge in our development.

1058
00:45:00.707 --> 00:45:03.852
And it also means being able to be more nonjudgmental

1059
00:45:03.852 --> 00:45:06.470
of myself when I've screwed up.

1060
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:08.474
But I've gone into my habit of mine.

1061
00:45:08.474 --> 00:45:10.488
When I've gotten mistrusting, for instance,

1062
00:45:10.488 --> 00:45:12.672
and I've questioned you overly

1063
00:45:12.672 --> 00:45:16.679
and to go like, and when I get reactive.

1064
00:45:17.747 --> 00:45:19.100
As a six, I'm gonna get reactive

1065
00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:21.553
if I feel I can't count on you, can't trust in you.

1066
00:45:22.656 --> 00:45:25.629
The reactivity needs to be befriended

1067
00:45:25.629 --> 00:45:27.755
because it's telling us about what were identified

1068
00:45:27.755 --> 00:45:29.306
with what we value.

1069
00:45:29.306 --> 00:45:31.673
In order to investigate it, which is the third A

1070
00:45:31.673 --> 00:45:34.448
which is called the action step.

1071
00:45:34.448 --> 00:45:37.028
And the action step is being able to pause.

1072
00:45:37.028 --> 00:45:39.449
I get reactive, I get upset with you or you get upset

1073
00:45:39.449 --> 00:45:41.936
when somebody tries to limit you.

1074
00:45:41.936 --> 00:45:43.723
If Scott's out there and tries to limit you,

1075
00:45:43.723 --> 00:45:46.199
so you're gonna get a little reactive about that.

1076
00:45:46.199 --> 00:45:47.345
<v Voiceover>A little.</v>

1077
00:45:47.345 --> 00:45:49.180
I'd say that's very fair to say.

1078
00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:50.999
<v ->And so to befriend that you can go like,</v>

1079
00:45:50.999 --> 00:45:52.513
"Is this really the big deal?"

1080
00:45:52.513 --> 00:45:55.137
And do that inquiry, so it means to pause,

1081
00:45:55.137 --> 00:45:58.272
do our inquiry, "Is this just my old habit of mine?"

1082
00:45:58.272 --> 00:46:01.125
Life does have its limitations.

1083
00:46:01.125 --> 00:46:02.529
It's just the big one versus the little one.

1084
00:46:02.529 --> 00:46:03.561
As it really anything--

1085
00:46:03.561 --> 00:46:05.008
<v Voiceover>Time to change your battle, so to speak.</v>

1086
00:46:05.008 --> 00:46:05.837
<v ->Can I just let go?</v>

1087
00:46:05.837 --> 00:46:07.209
Which is the third part of action

1088
00:46:07.209 --> 00:46:11.471
is going from the pausing, to the inquiry

1089
00:46:11.471 --> 00:46:13.329
and discernment to the third step

1090
00:46:13.329 --> 00:46:14.914
which is conscious conduct.

1091
00:46:14.914 --> 00:46:16.601
Maybe I can just let go of it.

1092
00:46:16.601 --> 00:46:18.866
Just let it go, it's no big deal.

1093
00:46:18.866 --> 00:46:21.160
Or if there's something else, how can I take action

1094
00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:23.498
that's respectful to my partner,

1095
00:46:23.498 --> 00:46:26.337
the other person and myself?

1096
00:46:26.337 --> 00:46:30.706
So the action is just like pause, befriend the reactivity,

1097
00:46:30.706 --> 00:46:34.608
the defensiveness, the upset, don't act it out,

1098
00:46:34.608 --> 00:46:36.781
do the inquiry process and with practice

1099
00:46:36.781 --> 00:46:39.076
you can get really fast at this and good

1100
00:46:39.076 --> 00:46:40.907
so I can do conscious conduct.

1101
00:46:40.907 --> 00:46:43.686
Go from conscious awareness to conscious conduct,

1102
00:46:43.686 --> 00:46:45.091
that's the third A.

1103
00:46:45.091 --> 00:46:48.944
And the fourth A, this is universal, is adherence.

1104
00:46:49.955 --> 00:46:52.715
Nothing good happens over time without intention,

1105
00:46:52.715 --> 00:46:54.386
without practice.

1106
00:46:54.386 --> 00:46:58.958
And every great world tradition advocates the first A

1107
00:46:58.958 --> 00:47:01.954
of awareness, the second A of acceptance love

1108
00:47:01.954 --> 00:47:05.026
and acceptance and having a practice

1109
00:47:05.026 --> 00:47:07.157
that brings you more present and aware

1110
00:47:07.157 --> 00:47:08.140
and adherence.

1111
00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:09.330
You're supposed to pray every day

1112
00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:11.860
if you're in a Christian tradition.

1113
00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:13.636
And meditate every day.

1114
00:47:13.636 --> 00:47:15.935
And just practice in our lives,

1115
00:47:15.935 --> 00:47:17.957
if I work with my reactivity every day

1116
00:47:17.957 --> 00:47:21.134
I make a commitment to that, things are gonna change.

1117
00:47:21.134 --> 00:47:24.472
The enneagrams give this in the action step.

1118
00:47:24.472 --> 00:47:25.820
It's huge.

1119
00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:27.962
Because it lets me know about all my patterns,

1120
00:47:27.962 --> 00:47:31.448
my reactivity, the things that I value are they correct,

1121
00:47:31.448 --> 00:47:33.141
do I need to have those anymore,

1122
00:47:33.141 --> 00:47:35.133
what if I didn't believe this anymore?

1123
00:47:36.009 --> 00:47:39.369
The enneagram's gift is there.

1124
00:47:39.369 --> 00:47:41.998
And the four A's, anybody can work with the four A's

1125
00:47:41.998 --> 00:47:44.454
and we can get stuck on any one particular one of them.

1126
00:47:44.454 --> 00:47:46.491
<v Voiceover>Well I think you've done a wonderful job</v>

1127
00:47:46.491 --> 00:47:47.224
in this book.

1128
00:47:47.224 --> 00:47:48.971
I've seen a few enneagram books,

1129
00:47:48.971 --> 00:47:53.918
but this one is so clear and comprehensive and direct.

1130
00:47:53.918 --> 00:47:56.821
And like you say it's inexpensive, it's tiny,

1131
00:47:56.821 --> 00:47:58.429
you can get right into it.

1132
00:47:58.429 --> 00:47:59.701
<v ->It's got the practices in it.</v>

1133
00:47:59.701 --> 00:48:01.707
It's got the universal growth process in it.

1134
00:48:01.707 --> 00:48:02.944
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

1135
00:48:02.944 --> 00:48:03.967
Beautifully done.

1136
00:48:03.967 --> 00:48:05.221
<v ->And it's called "The Essential Enneagram".</v>

1137
00:48:05.221 --> 00:48:06.687
<v Voiceover>"The Essential Enneagram".</v>

1138
00:48:06.687 --> 00:48:09.057
<v ->It's just out this year, the new edition.</v>

1139
00:48:09.057 --> 00:48:11.022
<v Voiceover>I just got a copy of the new edition</v>

1140
00:48:11.022 --> 00:48:11.835
as a matter of fact.

1141
00:48:11.835 --> 00:48:15.158
And you also do workshops around the world, right?

1142
00:48:15.158 --> 00:48:16.702
<v ->Lots of workshops and our website is</v>

1143
00:48:16.702 --> 00:48:19.029
enneagramworldwide.com.

1144
00:48:19.029 --> 00:48:22.417
And enneagram is E-N-N-E-A-G-R-A-M,

1145
00:48:22.417 --> 00:48:24.051
enneagramworldwide.com.

1146
00:48:24.051 --> 00:48:25.467
<v Voiceover>And we'll put a nice link to that below</v>

1147
00:48:25.467 --> 00:48:26.920
with some of your books underneath there.

1148
00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:30.556
But I really thank you for taking the time to do this.

1149
00:48:30.556 --> 00:48:32.649
It's a holiday week and we're kinda right up

1150
00:48:32.649 --> 00:48:33.993
against the time that your wife

1151
00:48:33.993 --> 00:48:36.562
would let us intrude on your lives

1152
00:48:36.562 --> 00:48:40.587
and I very much appreciate her, what do you call it,

1153
00:48:40.587 --> 00:48:41.406
get along?

1154
00:48:41.406 --> 00:48:42.462
<v ->Her go along and get along--</v>

1155
00:48:42.462 --> 00:48:44.412
<v Voiceover>Her go along and get along openness.</v>

1156
00:48:44.412 --> 00:48:47.044
<v ->Openness and receptivity, it's a great quality.</v>

1157
00:48:47.044 --> 00:48:48.406
<v Voiceover>It's a wonderful quality.</v>

1158
00:48:48.406 --> 00:48:50.272
And thank you so much for your time

1159
00:48:50.272 --> 00:48:51.022
and your many--

1160
00:48:51.022 --> 00:48:51.398
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1161
00:48:51.398 --> 00:48:53.596
It's been really enjoyable interacting with you

1162
00:48:53.596 --> 00:48:55.257
in this conversation.

1163
00:48:55.257 --> 00:48:56.810
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1164
00:48:58.564 --> 00:49:00.912
To learn more about yourself and the people you love

1165
00:49:00.912 --> 00:49:03.323
you can pick up a copy of "The Essential Enneagram"

1166
00:49:03.323 --> 00:49:05.072
via all major book sellers.

1167
00:49:05.072 --> 00:49:08.002
I found it really useful in understanding loved ones

1168
00:49:08.002 --> 00:49:11.157
and developing deeper compassion for our differences.

1169
00:49:11.157 --> 00:49:12.137
Until next time.

1170
00:49:12.137 --> 00:49:13.696
Thanks for watching CMN.
