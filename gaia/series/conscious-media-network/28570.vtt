00:00:00.986 --> 00:00:03.054
<v ->Bruce Lipton has been dazzling the world</v>

2
00:00:03.054 --> 00:00:05.424
with his work in the biology of belief.

3
00:00:05.424 --> 00:00:07.458
And telling the story of how our beliefs and

4
00:00:07.458 --> 00:00:09.828
environment shape our physical reality,

5
00:00:09.828 --> 00:00:12.431
including the development of our DNA.

6
00:00:12.431 --> 00:00:15.267
Now he has extended the understanding of the rise and fall

7
00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:18.403
of our belief systems to our cultures at large in

8
00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:20.821
his newest book, Spontaneous Evolution.

9
00:00:31.917 --> 00:00:33.251
<v Voiceover>Last time we spoke,</v>

10
00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:34.586
we were getting into the book,

11
00:00:34.586 --> 00:00:36.721
The Biology of Belief and we were talking about

12
00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:40.712
how cells act as parts of community, members of a community

13
00:00:40.712 --> 00:00:44.062
guided by our own consciousness, our own belief systems.

14
00:00:44.062 --> 00:00:45.864
But you've taken this work and you've

15
00:00:45.864 --> 00:00:48.233
expanded it out into a much larger scale,

16
00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:51.102
looking at the evolution of larger systems,

17
00:00:51.102 --> 00:00:53.805
in which each of us is acting like a cell

18
00:00:53.805 --> 00:00:57.742
within the microsystem of the human body and

19
00:00:57.742 --> 00:01:01.513
you're calling it spontaneous evolution in your new book.

20
00:01:01.513 --> 00:01:02.948
And we need to get into...

21
00:01:02.948 --> 00:01:05.950
I'd like to find out from you what had you...

22
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.085
What stimulated the leap from the

23
00:01:08.085 --> 00:01:10.755
body to the larger system of cultures,

24
00:01:10.755 --> 00:01:14.476
and some of the reason for why we need this now.

25
00:01:15.536 --> 00:01:17.795
<v ->Well, there are two interesting and scientific foundations</v>

26
00:01:17.795 --> 00:01:20.598
for extending the work from the biology of belief

27
00:01:20.598 --> 00:01:23.529
about cells and then extending it to people.

28
00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.472
Number one is that we now recognize that nature

29
00:01:27.472 --> 00:01:31.276
is designed, the geometry, the structure of nature

30
00:01:31.276 --> 00:01:35.113
is designed on the basis of what is called fractal geometry.

31
00:01:35.113 --> 00:01:37.182
And fractal geometry is unique geometry,

32
00:01:37.182 --> 00:01:38.650
not the one we learn in school.

33
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.718
The geometry we did learn in school,

34
00:01:40.718 --> 00:01:43.655
called Euclidean geometry, you can't model nature with it.

35
00:01:43.655 --> 00:01:46.891
All those triangles, cones, cubes, and spheres

36
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:48.927
are not what nature really looks like.

37
00:01:48.927 --> 00:01:50.929
But when we were five years old,

38
00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.863
when we were in kindergarten, we made a tree,

39
00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:55.834
we made a Euclidean tree, we had a cylinder for the trunk,

40
00:01:55.834 --> 00:01:59.070
a ball for the top, but obviously, that's not nature-like.

41
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.140
That geometry is not the nature geometry.

42
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.442
We now recognize this new geometry that

43
00:02:04.442 --> 00:02:07.613
really came into our world in 1983,

44
00:02:07.613 --> 00:02:10.115
with the work of Benoit Mandelbrot from IBM,

45
00:02:10.115 --> 00:02:11.550
called fractal geometry.

46
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.451
And it's a different version of geometry,

47
00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:14.419
and it's very exciting.

48
00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:15.754
But here's the fundamental,

49
00:02:15.754 --> 00:02:17.856
key characteristic of this geometry.

50
00:02:17.856 --> 00:02:20.424
Built into the nature of

51
00:02:20.424 --> 00:02:23.061
the mathematics is a reality

52
00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:26.799
that images of the structure repeat themselves

53
00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.069
in a very self similar fashion at any level

54
00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.070
of the organization that you're talking about.

55
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.907
So, if you want to talk about cells, or people,

56
00:02:34.907 --> 00:02:38.810
or civilizations, they're all built on the same geometry.

57
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.879
But the key word for most people to understand is

58
00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.871
that this geometry links an ancient, mystical understanding.

59
00:02:45.871 --> 00:02:48.686
There was a phrase people were familiar with:

60
00:02:48.686 --> 00:02:51.163
as above, so below.

61
00:02:51.163 --> 00:02:53.133
Well, in this new geometry,

62
00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:55.693
that becomes mathematical and scientific, as a reality.

63
00:02:55.693 --> 00:02:58.597
That's why I can study the nature of a cell

64
00:02:58.597 --> 00:03:01.399
and understand the nature of a human because

65
00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:03.602
a human is a fractal image of a cell.

66
00:03:03.602 --> 00:03:05.137
We're made out of cells,

67
00:03:05.137 --> 00:03:07.705
we're just a large version of a cell.

68
00:03:07.705 --> 00:03:11.309
And so that a human body turns not to be a one thing,

69
00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:12.778
as we see it in the mirror,

70
00:03:12.778 --> 00:03:14.312
but what we really understand,

71
00:03:14.312 --> 00:03:16.647
if you could see it with microscopic eyes,

72
00:03:16.647 --> 00:03:17.983
so you can see what it looked like,

73
00:03:17.983 --> 00:03:20.051
you'd recognize that a human body is a

74
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:23.421
community of upwards to 50 trillion cells.

75
00:03:23.421 --> 00:03:27.191
Every cell is essentially a miniature unit

76
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:29.160
because virtually, every cell has every function

77
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.930
that I have in my body, it's already present.

78
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.534
Matter of fact, any function that I do with my body

79
00:03:34.534 --> 00:03:37.502
is only because a cell can do that function

80
00:03:37.502 --> 00:03:38.503
because I'm made out of cells.

81
00:03:38.503 --> 00:03:40.038
<v Voiceover>And we're talking right down to</v>

82
00:03:40.038 --> 00:03:43.942
reacting to emotional and external stressors in life.

83
00:03:43.942 --> 00:03:47.899
<v ->Absolutely, the same responses of cells to their world</v>

84
00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:51.482
are exactly, the same kind of behavior responses

85
00:03:51.482 --> 00:03:53.184
that we have in our own world,

86
00:03:53.184 --> 00:03:54.852
and the world in where we live.

87
00:03:54.852 --> 00:03:56.354
So then it becomes understandable.

88
00:03:56.354 --> 00:04:00.192
This is why, for example, why we work on cells in biology.

89
00:04:00.192 --> 00:04:01.760
Because if we get an understanding

90
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.594
of the nature of the cells,

91
00:04:02.594 --> 00:04:04.429
we can apply that information directly to the

92
00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:07.799
nature of human biology so that we extend this work.

93
00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.501
So, in looking at nature's fractal,

94
00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:14.104
and recognizing that the cell is actually the fundamental...

95
00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:17.275
Recognize that the cell is the

96
00:04:17.275 --> 00:04:20.478
fundamental unit of the human body,

97
00:04:20.478 --> 00:04:22.280
that the human body is actually

98
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.249
built in the image of that cell,

99
00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:25.149
then we start to recognize...

100
00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:28.720
Inside of you right now are 50 trillion citizens.

101
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.723
Each cell is its own sentient being.

102
00:04:31.723 --> 00:04:33.024
When I was culturing these cells,

103
00:04:33.024 --> 00:04:34.526
I'd take them out of the person's body,

104
00:04:34.526 --> 00:04:35.493
put them in a culture dish,

105
00:04:35.493 --> 00:04:38.312
and they had their own life, they didn't need us.

106
00:04:38.312 --> 00:04:40.598
Then all of a sudden, you look back and you say,

107
00:04:40.598 --> 00:04:42.100
here we are in the world today,

108
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.268
with maybe seven billion people,

109
00:04:44.268 --> 00:04:47.172
and we're on the edge of our own survival,

110
00:04:47.172 --> 00:04:50.074
we're pushing our own extermination,

111
00:04:50.074 --> 00:04:52.043
extinction is looming.

112
00:04:52.043 --> 00:04:53.812
And because we can't seem to get along with

113
00:04:53.812 --> 00:04:55.013
seven billion people on the entire

114
00:04:55.013 --> 00:04:56.848
globe of the surface of this Earth,

115
00:04:56.848 --> 00:04:58.182
and then I say, you know what,

116
00:04:58.182 --> 00:05:01.252
inside of your body right now are 50 trillion cells.

117
00:05:01.252 --> 00:05:02.754
They're like miniature humans,

118
00:05:02.754 --> 00:05:04.388
every cell has their own life,

119
00:05:04.388 --> 00:05:07.993
every cell has a job, every cell gets healthcare,

120
00:05:07.993 --> 00:05:11.062
every cell gets protection, they live in a world.

121
00:05:11.062 --> 00:05:13.598
They get paid, actually, for their work.

122
00:05:13.598 --> 00:05:16.333
So, all of a sudden I say, there's a civilization

123
00:05:16.333 --> 00:05:19.137
inside of us that is far more adaptable,

124
00:05:20.907 --> 00:05:23.007
and capable of living in a world than we are.

125
00:05:23.007 --> 00:05:24.208
And look at it this way,

126
00:05:24.208 --> 00:05:25.743
they've been here a million years.

127
00:05:25.743 --> 00:05:29.046
And guess what, when you are happy,

128
00:05:29.046 --> 00:05:32.217
and you are healthy, that means that 50 trillion

129
00:05:32.217 --> 00:05:35.853
citizens in your body are simultaneously

130
00:05:35.853 --> 00:05:37.822
healthy and happy along with you.

131
00:05:37.822 --> 00:05:39.991
Now, imagine if a whole world could

132
00:05:39.991 --> 00:05:41.893
be like a healthy human body.

133
00:05:41.893 --> 00:05:45.596
So, when we take the scientific foundation of fractals,

134
00:05:45.596 --> 00:05:48.098
and apply that to our world,

135
00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:50.068
and we say, look, you want to understand

136
00:05:50.068 --> 00:05:51.737
how to have an economy?

137
00:05:51.737 --> 00:05:54.572
Cells get paid, and it's interesting,

138
00:05:54.572 --> 00:05:57.309
they're not communist in the sense that the skin cell

139
00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:59.577
and the nerve cell gets the same amount of money, man.

140
00:05:59.577 --> 00:06:02.880
The nerve cell makes a lot more money,

141
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.516
but it's job is a much greater job.

142
00:06:05.516 --> 00:06:06.585
A skin cell makes less.

143
00:06:06.585 --> 00:06:09.653
Every cell is paid according to its job.

144
00:06:09.653 --> 00:06:13.604
But basically says this, there's no success in the system

145
00:06:13.604 --> 00:06:17.195
until every cell has gotten its pay,

146
00:06:17.195 --> 00:06:19.331
and every cells has done its job,

147
00:06:19.331 --> 00:06:22.400
and every contributes to the whole of the community.

148
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.502
And then you look inside that community and you figure,

149
00:06:24.502 --> 00:06:26.871
my goodness, how'd they figure all that out?

150
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:29.641
And the answer is as above, so below.

151
00:06:29.641 --> 00:06:32.343
So if we look at the nature of how it works inside,

152
00:06:32.343 --> 00:06:35.814
then we are given evidence through nature,

153
00:06:35.814 --> 00:06:37.515
and through fractal geometry,

154
00:06:37.515 --> 00:06:40.418
of how to do the same thing out here in our world.

155
00:06:40.418 --> 00:06:42.186
And then when you start to look at that,

156
00:06:42.186 --> 00:06:43.855
that's what my work start to extend and go,

157
00:06:43.855 --> 00:06:47.325
wait a minute, we as individual units,

158
00:06:47.325 --> 00:06:51.028
are like cells in a larger

159
00:06:51.028 --> 00:06:53.731
super organism called humanity.

160
00:06:53.731 --> 00:06:56.101
And what this new work that I'm involved with,

161
00:06:56.101 --> 00:06:58.236
spontaneous evolution, is concerned about,

162
00:06:58.236 --> 00:07:01.703
is we're on the threshold of an evolutionary leap.

163
00:07:02.773 --> 00:07:04.608
It's not the evolution of the human,

164
00:07:04.608 --> 00:07:06.243
humans are already evolved.

165
00:07:06.243 --> 00:07:08.145
We're not evolving and changing,

166
00:07:08.145 --> 00:07:10.314
it's the organization of humans

167
00:07:10.314 --> 00:07:11.882
that is evolving and changing.

168
00:07:11.882 --> 00:07:13.317
And in the biosphere,

169
00:07:13.317 --> 00:07:16.855
we talk about humans collectively as an organism,

170
00:07:16.855 --> 00:07:18.289
as a super organism.

171
00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:21.458
So it's civilization that's evolving.

172
00:07:21.458 --> 00:07:23.794
And then, when you put all of these pictures back together,

173
00:07:23.794 --> 00:07:26.496
and you say, wait, if it's all built on fractals,

174
00:07:26.496 --> 00:07:28.967
and it's all built on repetitive patterns,

175
00:07:28.967 --> 00:07:31.536
then the evolution of civilization

176
00:07:31.536 --> 00:07:34.372
would be a fractal image of evolution

177
00:07:34.372 --> 00:07:36.307
that has already been played out before.

178
00:07:36.307 --> 00:07:39.778
So if we could go back in the biosphere to lower levels,

179
00:07:39.778 --> 00:07:43.314
see how the steps of evolution were accomplished,

180
00:07:43.314 --> 00:07:46.617
apply that information to our civilization,

181
00:07:46.617 --> 00:07:48.621
then we can make the necessary jump

182
00:07:48.621 --> 00:07:51.422
that we're being forced to make right now.

183
00:07:51.422 --> 00:07:53.524
<v Voiceover>And this really goes back to belief systems?</v>

184
00:07:54.764 --> 00:07:55.342
<v ->Oh, absolutely.</v>

185
00:07:55.342 --> 00:07:56.260
<v Voiceover>The whole thing is based on</v>

186
00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.696
the belief system of cultures throughout the ages

187
00:07:58.696 --> 00:08:01.065
and what motivated those cultures.

188
00:08:01.065 --> 00:08:04.334
And their religions, and so forth, right?

189
00:08:04.334 --> 00:08:05.836
<v ->Yeah, it's very interesting because,</v>

190
00:08:05.836 --> 00:08:07.738
I'll give you a scientific fact,

191
00:08:07.738 --> 00:08:09.041
the way I see it right now,

192
00:08:09.041 --> 00:08:11.970
and that is civilization as we know it is ending.

193
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:12.644
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

194
00:08:12.644 --> 00:08:15.080
<v ->And that doesn't mean that people are disappearing</v>

195
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.215
and the world disappears and all this.

196
00:08:17.215 --> 00:08:19.384
It just says the way we live in

197
00:08:19.384 --> 00:08:21.786
our world and have been living,

198
00:08:21.786 --> 00:08:24.422
is changing so that order for us to survive,

199
00:08:24.422 --> 00:08:26.791
we must change the way we live on this planet.

200
00:08:26.791 --> 00:08:29.626
And we're being forced into this because there's

201
00:08:29.626 --> 00:08:31.995
just a very obvious thing from the level of science.

202
00:08:31.995 --> 00:08:35.954
Science has recognize that on this planet, in our history,

203
00:08:35.954 --> 00:08:38.269
there have been five times where

204
00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:41.072
biological life essentially got wiped out,

205
00:08:41.072 --> 00:08:42.574
and then started all over again.

206
00:08:42.574 --> 00:08:45.142
These are called mass extinctions.

207
00:08:45.142 --> 00:08:47.979
So there were five previous mass extinctions in our history,

208
00:08:47.979 --> 00:08:49.981
and what's interesting, all of them have been

209
00:08:49.981 --> 00:08:53.151
attributed to extra-terrestial forces such as

210
00:08:53.151 --> 00:08:55.820
a comet, or an ansteroid hiting the planet,

211
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.023
destroying the environment, causing upheaval,

212
00:08:58.023 --> 00:09:01.892
loss of life, and then, a resurgence of all new life forms.

213
00:09:01.892 --> 00:09:04.528
Okay, so we've now established that five times,

214
00:09:04.528 --> 00:09:05.830
this has already occurred.

215
00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:09.500
Here's the freaky part, science now recognizes

216
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.037
we're deep into the sixth mass extinction.

217
00:09:13.037 --> 00:09:14.839
Now, science doesn't say we're

218
00:09:14.839 --> 00:09:16.974
flirting with mass extinction,

219
00:09:16.974 --> 00:09:19.377
it's already recognized we are deep

220
00:09:19.377 --> 00:09:21.779
into the throes of a mass extinction.

221
00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:23.515
Species are disappearing at rates

222
00:09:23.515 --> 00:09:25.883
that have never been seen before.

223
00:09:25.883 --> 00:09:29.754
That our own survival, is now actually a question.

224
00:09:29.754 --> 00:09:31.489
It's not like, well, do you think

225
00:09:31.489 --> 00:09:32.190
we're going to be affected by it?

226
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.758
No, the question now is will we survive this,

227
00:09:34.758 --> 00:09:36.427
from a scientific understanding.

228
00:09:36.427 --> 00:09:38.128
Consider this simple fact,

229
00:09:38.128 --> 00:09:41.465
it is now established by science with 40 years,

230
00:09:41.465 --> 00:09:43.633
the fish that we're familiar with

231
00:09:43.633 --> 00:09:45.602
will be fished out of the ocean.

232
00:09:45.602 --> 00:09:48.707
Okay, that's almost unimaginable to believe that.

233
00:09:50.257 --> 00:09:53.178
Nature is a chain structure, a web structure.

234
00:09:53.178 --> 00:09:56.347
And you start knocking out the pieces, the web underneath,

235
00:09:56.347 --> 00:09:59.150
then the entire web starts to crash.

236
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.285
So yes indeed, science has recognized

237
00:10:01.285 --> 00:10:03.087
we're facing our own extinction.

238
00:10:03.087 --> 00:10:05.890
So that means we have to change the nature of civilization.

239
00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:07.258
But here's the fun part,

240
00:10:07.258 --> 00:10:09.226
this isn't the first time that this has happened.

241
00:10:09.226 --> 00:10:12.563
In Western civilization, we can go back and I can tell you

242
00:10:12.563 --> 00:10:16.134
there have been five different civilizations that have come,

243
00:10:16.134 --> 00:10:19.772
raised up their way of life, and the world lived that way,

244
00:10:19.772 --> 00:10:22.072
then those civilizations have crashed,

245
00:10:22.072 --> 00:10:23.307
and have been replaced by new

246
00:10:23.307 --> 00:10:25.310
civilizations with different ways of life.

247
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.145
This is not like the first time his has happened.

248
00:10:28.145 --> 00:10:29.981
So we could go back,

249
00:10:29.981 --> 00:10:31.582
and if we understand the nature of

250
00:10:31.582 --> 00:10:35.420
how a civilization rises, and then why does it fall,

251
00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.657
then look at these patterns, which are fractal,

252
00:10:38.657 --> 00:10:41.327
then we can say, where are we in this process?

253
00:10:42.477 --> 00:10:43.494
Of course, the most exciting thing is

254
00:10:43.494 --> 00:10:44.595
I don't have to tell you that,

255
00:10:44.595 --> 00:10:46.063
we don't have to tell the audience

256
00:10:46.063 --> 00:10:49.768
we're on the cusp of an evolutionary upheaval.

257
00:10:49.768 --> 00:10:53.104
We're facing it everyday, people can feel it.

258
00:10:53.104 --> 00:10:54.405
And it's very interesting because

259
00:10:54.405 --> 00:10:57.542
it may not be a conscious thing that they feel,

260
00:10:57.542 --> 00:10:59.344
because there's something more profoundly,

261
00:10:59.344 --> 00:11:02.246
deeply biological that's affecting them first.

262
00:11:02.246 --> 00:11:03.982
And it's something that, in biology

263
00:11:03.982 --> 00:11:06.420
we call the biological imperative.

264
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.084
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

265
00:11:07.084 --> 00:11:09.020
<v ->And the biological imperative is an</v>

266
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.655
understanding that science has,

267
00:11:10.655 --> 00:11:12.257
but it hasn't been able to find

268
00:11:12.257 --> 00:11:14.025
the mechanism to account for it.

269
00:11:14.025 --> 00:11:15.426
But here's the understanding,

270
00:11:15.426 --> 00:11:18.963
any organism whose life is threatened,

271
00:11:18.963 --> 00:11:20.565
the organism will take

272
00:11:20.565 --> 00:11:24.468
every action possible to survive.

273
00:11:24.468 --> 00:11:26.037
So it says that somehow rather,

274
00:11:26.037 --> 00:11:29.073
built into an organism is a drive to stay alive.

275
00:11:29.073 --> 00:11:31.242
And when that

276
00:11:31.242 --> 00:11:33.978
staying alive becomes threatened,

277
00:11:33.978 --> 00:11:36.847
then the organism is engaged and activated

278
00:11:36.847 --> 00:11:39.517
to take any action at that point,

279
00:11:39.517 --> 00:11:41.518
to survive whatever the threat

280
00:11:41.518 --> 00:11:43.587
is being imposed upon them.

281
00:11:43.587 --> 00:11:45.757
So basically, most people don't really

282
00:11:45.757 --> 00:11:49.293
see the mechanics of what's going on in the world.

283
00:11:49.293 --> 00:11:52.796
But regardless of that, they're very familiar with this,

284
00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:56.199
that it seems kind of shaky, it's kind of threatening,

285
00:11:56.199 --> 00:11:57.768
they feel it in their gut.

286
00:11:57.768 --> 00:11:59.770
That's the biological imperative that says

287
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:03.540
something's not right and I'm concerned about this.

288
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.810
So it says, yes, the entire population,

289
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.645
even if they're not conscious of it,

290
00:12:07.645 --> 00:12:09.980
is being driven by a biological reality

291
00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.684
that we're on the edge of something that is so

292
00:12:12.684 --> 00:12:15.453
life-changing, and we don't know.

293
00:12:15.453 --> 00:12:16.921
And that's the exciting part, but then...

294
00:12:16.921 --> 00:12:19.357
<v Voiceover>It's exciting to some and to others</v>

295
00:12:19.357 --> 00:12:21.925
who have grabbed a little bit further of the next emotion,

296
00:12:21.925 --> 00:12:23.098
I think would be called fear...

297
00:12:23.098 --> 00:12:24.508
(laughs)

298
00:12:24.508 --> 00:12:26.731
<v ->Well, biological imperative actually induces fear.</v>

299
00:12:26.731 --> 00:12:27.532
<v Voiceover>Yes it does.</v>

300
00:12:27.532 --> 00:12:28.833
Well, this is interesting.

301
00:12:28.833 --> 00:12:31.936
This is going to be a larger part of this conversation

302
00:12:31.936 --> 00:12:34.974
because here you have people going into fear

303
00:12:34.974 --> 00:12:38.768
because they can sense of feel this imperative issue,

304
00:12:38.768 --> 00:12:41.479
and as a result, this creates often in times,

305
00:12:41.479 --> 00:12:43.982
the old paradigm of competition when in fact,

306
00:12:43.982 --> 00:12:46.917
we're moving into a new type of evolutionary pattern,

307
00:12:46.917 --> 00:12:49.052
which actually requires the opposite.

308
00:12:50.262 --> 00:12:52.062
I want to get into where those two bump up

309
00:12:52.062 --> 00:12:53.657
against each other and how it's accomplished.

310
00:12:53.657 --> 00:12:55.058
But can you do me a favor,

311
00:12:55.058 --> 00:12:56.760
because I heard you lecture a while back

312
00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.997
and I love the way you did this little diagram

313
00:12:59.997 --> 00:13:02.132
in terms of belief systems and it says

314
00:13:02.132 --> 00:13:04.935
where we started, the cycles we move through,

315
00:13:04.935 --> 00:13:07.538
and how we're ending right back where we started.

316
00:13:07.538 --> 00:13:10.107
And then you were talking again about animism

317
00:13:10.107 --> 00:13:11.409
and so forth, thing going through.

318
00:13:11.409 --> 00:13:14.246
And then talking about scientific materialism, animism,

319
00:13:14.246 --> 00:13:16.981
could you give just your brief little talk to us--

320
00:13:16.981 --> 00:13:17.815
<v ->The thumbnail sketch.</v>

321
00:13:17.815 --> 00:13:19.483
<v Voiceover>The thumbnail sketch of how</v>

322
00:13:19.483 --> 00:13:21.520
that wheel of life has been...

323
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.655
<v ->Oh, absolutely.</v>

324
00:13:23.655 --> 00:13:26.390
It's very exciting because we can

325
00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.496
go back to the earliest civilizations,

326
00:13:29.706 --> 00:13:32.296
when humanity started to come out of their

327
00:13:32.296 --> 00:13:35.699
animal phase and started to come into a social organization.

328
00:13:35.699 --> 00:13:38.645
It was at that time, at the earliest time,

329
00:13:38.645 --> 00:13:42.073
that the first fundamental questions of our existence arose.

330
00:13:42.073 --> 00:13:43.974
People started to ask the question,

331
00:13:43.974 --> 00:13:47.312
how did we get here and why are we here?

332
00:13:47.312 --> 00:13:50.114
How can we make the best of it while we're here?

333
00:13:50.114 --> 00:13:52.482
Fundamental questions of human life.

334
00:13:52.482 --> 00:13:54.886
Well, we can go back and we'll have to then

335
00:13:54.886 --> 00:13:57.188
recognize that the earliest civilizations...

336
00:13:57.188 --> 00:13:58.789
So let's just work with the

337
00:13:58.789 --> 00:14:00.991
civilization I refer to as animism.

338
00:14:00.991 --> 00:14:03.428
Animism, which is reflected, for example,

339
00:14:03.428 --> 00:14:05.229
in the Native American way of life,

340
00:14:05.229 --> 00:14:08.733
or the Druids in Europe, or the Aborigines in Australia,

341
00:14:08.733 --> 00:14:11.301
these were people who lived in

342
00:14:11.301 --> 00:14:13.270
harmony with their environment.

343
00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:16.474
And they recognized that their world consisted

344
00:14:16.474 --> 00:14:19.158
of two realms, the physical,

345
00:14:19.158 --> 00:14:21.088
tangible, material realm,

346
00:14:21.088 --> 00:14:23.080
but they were also very familiar with the

347
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.116
non-physical realm, an energy, an invisible realm

348
00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:29.119
of influences that were not physical and tangible.

349
00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:31.289
So basically, they looked at their world as

350
00:14:31.289 --> 00:14:32.323
a balance between the two.

351
00:14:32.323 --> 00:14:34.358
So for example if you were Native American,

352
00:14:34.358 --> 00:14:36.560
and you wanted to go on a hunt,

353
00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.030
let's say you want to go hunt for a buffalo,

354
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.498
you know that's the physical thing you were looking for,

355
00:14:41.498 --> 00:14:44.535
but you also recognized there's an invisible relevance

356
00:14:44.535 --> 00:14:47.371
to that buffalo as well, an energy, a spirit to it.

357
00:14:47.371 --> 00:14:48.840
So if you want to go hunt for the buffalo,

358
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:49.974
yes you wanted the physical animal,

359
00:14:49.974 --> 00:14:53.907
but you really had to appeal to its energy and its spirit.

360
00:14:53.907 --> 00:14:57.415
So, in an animistic realm, they saw both worlds

361
00:14:57.415 --> 00:15:00.150
existing simultaneously and not separable.

362
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.884
<v Voiceover>Mhm.</v>

363
00:15:00.884 --> 00:15:03.887
<v ->An animal and its spirit were always connected.</v>

364
00:15:03.887 --> 00:15:06.790
And that you had to recognize both realms

365
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:08.225
to make sense out of the world.

366
00:15:08.225 --> 00:15:09.826
<v Voiceover>And the people and</v>

367
00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:10.728
their spirit were connected.

368
00:15:10.728 --> 00:15:11.728
<v ->Oh everything.</v>

369
00:15:11.728 --> 00:15:12.230
<v Voiceover>Everything.</v>

370
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.566
Yeah, a raindrop, a rabbit, a human,

371
00:15:15.566 --> 00:15:18.536
anything that was tangible and physical,

372
00:15:18.536 --> 00:15:20.972
did have an energetic

373
00:15:20.972 --> 00:15:23.374
complement to it, okay?

374
00:15:23.374 --> 00:15:25.142
And they were always connected.

375
00:15:25.142 --> 00:15:27.745
So, they were very spiritual people but

376
00:15:27.745 --> 00:15:28.913
they were also very material.

377
00:15:28.913 --> 00:15:30.414
They lived in the world.

378
00:15:32.064 --> 00:15:34.785
Basically, the questions that they were

379
00:15:34.785 --> 00:15:36.087
trying to answer were the same questions

380
00:15:36.087 --> 00:15:38.055
that were being asked by humans all over the world.

381
00:15:38.055 --> 00:15:39.656
Same questions, how did we get here

382
00:15:39.656 --> 00:15:41.492
and why are we here, et cetera.

383
00:15:41.492 --> 00:15:44.396
Well, it's interesting because the questions,

384
00:15:44.396 --> 00:15:46.565
these fundamental questions are frequently

385
00:15:46.565 --> 00:15:48.632
referred to as the perennial questions.

386
00:15:48.632 --> 00:15:51.402
They've been asked forever, they're the same questions.

387
00:15:51.402 --> 00:15:54.071
Now, here's a fun part in looking

388
00:15:54.071 --> 00:15:56.140
at the research I got involved with.

389
00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.777
We went through different phases of our civilization.

390
00:15:59.777 --> 00:16:03.480
And I thought, what is that brings up a civilization,

391
00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.084
and what is it that brings it back down

392
00:16:06.084 --> 00:16:07.418
and brings up the next one?

393
00:16:07.418 --> 00:16:09.586
And it turns out that it's very simple.

394
00:16:09.586 --> 00:16:11.088
And it works like this:

395
00:16:11.088 --> 00:16:13.593
a civilization

396
00:16:13.593 --> 00:16:17.227
is based on the beliefs that...

397
00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:19.930
or the answers to the perenial questions.

398
00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.601
Whoever provides answers to those fundamental questions,

399
00:16:23.601 --> 00:16:25.203
how did we get here, why are we here,

400
00:16:25.203 --> 00:16:26.470
how do we make the best of it?

401
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:29.440
If a group buys the answer from

402
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.908
some entity or some organization,

403
00:16:31.908 --> 00:16:34.078
we have a couple of things going on.

404
00:16:34.078 --> 00:16:37.915
Number one, we then make that source our

405
00:16:37.915 --> 00:16:39.750
truth provider for that civilization.

406
00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.452
Whoever we buy the answers from,

407
00:16:41.452 --> 00:16:43.554
we have question about anything else,

408
00:16:43.554 --> 00:16:46.656
we go to them, because they are our truth providers.

409
00:16:46.656 --> 00:16:50.294
Number two, whatever answers they provide,

410
00:16:50.294 --> 00:16:53.363
then we use those as a guide

411
00:16:53.363 --> 00:16:55.233
to shape how we live

412
00:16:55.233 --> 00:16:58.569
with each other and with our relationship to the planet.

413
00:16:58.569 --> 00:17:01.238
And now here's the interesting, fun part,

414
00:17:01.238 --> 00:17:03.473
that what we have seen over the years is that

415
00:17:03.473 --> 00:17:07.474
the answers to the questions change periodically.

416
00:17:07.474 --> 00:17:10.381
And when the answers to the questions change,

417
00:17:10.381 --> 00:17:12.250
new answers come in,

418
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.351
provided by new truth providers,

419
00:17:14.351 --> 00:17:16.621
with new ways of living life.

420
00:17:16.621 --> 00:17:19.289
The old ways then start to crash,

421
00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:21.758
and a new civilization comes up.

422
00:17:21.758 --> 00:17:23.093
It doesn't mean you get rid of everything

423
00:17:23.093 --> 00:17:24.995
from the previous civilization.

424
00:17:24.995 --> 00:17:27.266
You take the stuff that was good,

425
00:17:27.266 --> 00:17:30.300
bring it with you, and then add the new information.

426
00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.137
So we're always taking along the things that work

427
00:17:33.137 --> 00:17:34.472
and adding the new things.

428
00:17:34.472 --> 00:17:36.673
And the things that don't work at the end of civilization,

429
00:17:36.673 --> 00:17:39.743
we let those go and replace them with the new beliefs.

430
00:17:39.743 --> 00:17:41.668
Okay, so...

431
00:17:41.668 --> 00:17:42.914
<v Voiceover>So, then how do get</v>

432
00:17:42.914 --> 00:17:45.583
from animism to what followed?

433
00:17:45.583 --> 00:17:48.485
<v ->Well, let's answer the question as animist did,</v>

434
00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:49.687
why did they live this way?

435
00:17:49.687 --> 00:17:51.221
And the answer to the question is

436
00:17:51.221 --> 00:17:52.557
how did we get here?

437
00:17:52.557 --> 00:17:54.391
And to animists, the answer is essentially

438
00:17:55.531 --> 00:17:57.394
father sky and mother earth.

439
00:17:57.394 --> 00:18:00.731
You might say, oh that sounds really nice and mythological,

440
00:18:00.731 --> 00:18:02.232
and fairytale-like, and it turns out,

441
00:18:02.232 --> 00:18:04.768
no, it's absolutely the most scientifically

442
00:18:04.768 --> 00:18:06.837
accurate assessment of how we got here.

443
00:18:06.837 --> 00:18:09.773
We got here because we are made out of

444
00:18:09.773 --> 00:18:13.344
elements of the earth, the atoms, the physical material.

445
00:18:13.344 --> 00:18:16.380
But that's just inorganic chemistry,

446
00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.516
like earth, and crystals and rocks, and stuff like that.

447
00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:22.653
But when you take the earth, the elements of earth,

448
00:18:22.653 --> 00:18:24.838
and combine it with sunlight,

449
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.958
then you take an element of the earth

450
00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:30.260
and mix it with the energy unit,

451
00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.329
so now you have energized earth,

452
00:18:32.329 --> 00:18:34.731
and this is called organic chemistry,

453
00:18:34.731 --> 00:18:37.568
and it provides the foundation of all living organisms.

454
00:18:37.568 --> 00:18:39.603
So living organisms are made out of

455
00:18:39.603 --> 00:18:41.439
the elements of the earth that have

456
00:18:41.439 --> 00:18:43.808
fused with the energy of the sun.

457
00:18:43.808 --> 00:18:46.210
So they're energized matter,

458
00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.380
we're enlivened matter,

459
00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:51.314
that we are infused with the light from the sun.

460
00:18:51.314 --> 00:18:53.082
This is where our energy comes from.

461
00:18:53.082 --> 00:18:55.653
So as living things, we express

462
00:18:55.653 --> 00:18:58.222
mother earth and father sky, okay?

463
00:18:58.222 --> 00:19:00.591
So that makes total scientific sense.

464
00:19:00.591 --> 00:19:02.358
And then, the next question is then

465
00:19:02.358 --> 00:19:03.660
why are we here?

466
00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.432
Well, they had a great answer, those animists.

467
00:19:07.432 --> 00:19:10.034
They said we're here to tend the garden.

468
00:19:10.034 --> 00:19:12.503
And they knew at that point,

469
00:19:12.503 --> 00:19:16.139
that every organism is part of a community,

470
00:19:16.139 --> 00:19:17.975
that the entire biosphere,

471
00:19:17.975 --> 00:19:20.644
including the humans in that biosphere,

472
00:19:20.644 --> 00:19:23.180
are one entangled, integrated whole.

473
00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.516
And if they learned to live in harmony with each other,

474
00:19:25.516 --> 00:19:28.320
it will prosper and the garden will grow.

475
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.721
So yeah, we're here to tend the garden, great idea.

476
00:19:31.721 --> 00:19:33.523
And how do you do that?

477
00:19:33.523 --> 00:19:36.127
And the answer is learn to live in harmony

478
00:19:36.127 --> 00:19:38.329
with each other and with nature.

479
00:19:38.329 --> 00:19:40.797
So, these sound like wonderful ways of life,

480
00:19:40.797 --> 00:19:43.734
and in fact, many people in this world aspire

481
00:19:43.734 --> 00:19:45.602
to that exact way of life.

482
00:19:45.602 --> 00:19:46.370
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

483
00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:48.772
<v ->But what happened over time was,</v>

484
00:19:48.772 --> 00:19:50.941
we bought into some new beliefs.

485
00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:54.211
And the new beliefs to the next level of evolution changed,

486
00:19:54.211 --> 00:19:56.614
that instead of every physical object having

487
00:19:56.614 --> 00:19:58.715
a spirit entangled with it,

488
00:19:58.715 --> 00:20:00.917
the next level of our culture bought into a belief

489
00:20:00.917 --> 00:20:04.822
that said well, the spirit is separate from the matter.

490
00:20:04.822 --> 00:20:06.791
And that there are gods.

491
00:20:06.791 --> 00:20:08.559
So there's a god of water.

492
00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:10.927
Animists said that every drop of water has a spirit,

493
00:20:10.927 --> 00:20:14.565
but the next level is called polytheism, many gods.

494
00:20:14.565 --> 00:20:18.201
And what that did was take the spirit out of the matter

495
00:20:18.201 --> 00:20:19.302
and make it a separate entity.

496
00:20:19.302 --> 00:20:21.572
So I can talk about, oh, here's matter over here,

497
00:20:21.572 --> 00:20:23.040
and here's spirit over here,

498
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.109
now we can talk about them as separate elements.

499
00:20:25.109 --> 00:20:27.377
Animists, you could never separate them.

500
00:20:27.377 --> 00:20:28.947
Okay, so now what does that mean?

501
00:20:28.947 --> 00:20:30.782
Well, the first thing it means is this,

502
00:20:30.782 --> 00:20:34.218
as humans, we lost our spirit.

503
00:20:34.218 --> 00:20:36.687
There was a spirit of humanity,

504
00:20:36.687 --> 00:20:38.889
but it wasn't in you and me anymore.

505
00:20:38.889 --> 00:20:41.225
We're just like the rocks and the dirt now,

506
00:20:41.225 --> 00:20:42.459
in regard to that.

507
00:20:42.459 --> 00:20:44.928
Then there was an emphasis to say,

508
00:20:44.928 --> 00:20:46.964
well, which realm is more important?

509
00:20:46.964 --> 00:20:50.334
Well, the invisible realm got the knots on that one.

510
00:20:50.334 --> 00:20:51.169
And people started to say,

511
00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:52.503
yes, let's worship the gods.

512
00:20:52.503 --> 00:20:55.773
And the material realm got less value to it

513
00:20:55.773 --> 00:20:57.908
because it was that mystery that

514
00:20:57.908 --> 00:20:59.710
came from the invisible realm.

515
00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.480
And basically, it changed the way we lived on this planet,

516
00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.782
when the truths started to come from

517
00:21:04.782 --> 00:21:08.084
the priests of the polytheistic temples,

518
00:21:08.084 --> 00:21:10.587
we lost our power, our spirit.

519
00:21:10.587 --> 00:21:12.889
We're in a world disconnected from spirit,

520
00:21:12.889 --> 00:21:15.091
but we want to learn to live in harmony with spirit.

521
00:21:15.091 --> 00:21:18.028
So for example, in the Greeks,

522
00:21:18.028 --> 00:21:19.363
their answers to the question,

523
00:21:19.363 --> 00:21:20.931
how did we get here,

524
00:21:20.931 --> 00:21:23.167
and the answers the Greek came up with,

525
00:21:23.167 --> 00:21:25.135
we came from chaos, and you go,

526
00:21:25.135 --> 00:21:26.537
well, that's kind of weird.

527
00:21:26.537 --> 00:21:28.606
And then I say, now, wait a minute,

528
00:21:28.606 --> 00:21:31.207
as scientists and physicists will tell you,

529
00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:33.877
that the physical universe came out of a chaos

530
00:21:33.877 --> 00:21:37.248
of energy one day in a big bang and exploded into reality.

531
00:21:37.248 --> 00:21:40.584
So, the Greeks had an insight to this already as well.

532
00:21:40.584 --> 00:21:41.852
So they weren't wrong,

533
00:21:41.852 --> 00:21:43.721
it was just a new vision on the take.

534
00:21:43.721 --> 00:21:44.521
But then you say, well,

535
00:21:44.521 --> 00:21:45.923
if you came from chaos then what's

536
00:21:45.923 --> 00:21:46.890
our purpose for being here?

537
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.658
Well, they had trouble with the answer to that.

538
00:21:48.658 --> 00:21:50.394
It's like, well, it was chaos.

539
00:21:50.394 --> 00:21:51.161
I don't know why we're here,

540
00:21:51.161 --> 00:21:52.997
we just came out of this chaos.

541
00:21:52.997 --> 00:21:55.765
But they did have an answer for the third question,

542
00:21:55.765 --> 00:21:58.434
the perennial question of how do you make the best of it.

543
00:21:58.434 --> 00:22:01.038
And their answer was, and I like it because it's fun,

544
00:22:01.038 --> 00:22:02.523
don't anger the gods.

545
00:22:04.241 --> 00:22:05.041
What does that mean?

546
00:22:05.041 --> 00:22:06.409
Well, here's the point.

547
00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:08.378
In polytheism, the gods can take on

548
00:22:08.378 --> 00:22:09.980
any different form and shape,

549
00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.250
that the person sitting next to you at a table

550
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.386
could be god, you don't know,

551
00:22:15.386 --> 00:22:17.153
because the gods are always changing.

552
00:22:17.153 --> 00:22:19.357
Well, that means if you don't know who god is,

553
00:22:19.357 --> 00:22:22.727
well then, you better be darn nice to everybody

554
00:22:22.727 --> 00:22:24.428
because you don't know.

555
00:22:24.428 --> 00:22:27.330
So, it really generated a communal understanding,

556
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:28.933
okay, I like everybody because

557
00:22:28.933 --> 00:22:30.968
one of you might be god in here.

558
00:22:30.968 --> 00:22:32.569
<v Voiceover>Don't want the judgement.</v>

559
00:22:32.569 --> 00:22:34.438
<v ->So, we bought that and it was a</v>

560
00:22:34.438 --> 00:22:37.274
period where civilization removed an

561
00:22:37.274 --> 00:22:39.209
emphasis from the material plane,

562
00:22:39.209 --> 00:22:41.444
and started putting a little bit more emphasis

563
00:22:41.444 --> 00:22:43.981
into appeasing and appealing the invisible

564
00:22:43.981 --> 00:22:46.683
forces that apparently were shaping the planet.

565
00:22:46.683 --> 00:22:48.719
And what's very interesting,

566
00:22:48.719 --> 00:22:52.221
every civilization, be it the animists or the polytheist,

567
00:22:52.221 --> 00:22:54.258
or the other ones we're going to talk about,

568
00:22:54.258 --> 00:22:57.627
civilizations are like living organisms.

569
00:22:57.627 --> 00:23:01.197
They arise, they're born, they develop,

570
00:23:01.197 --> 00:23:03.834
they go into a mature, adult stage,

571
00:23:03.834 --> 00:23:06.603
and then at some point, they go into a decline.

572
00:23:06.603 --> 00:23:08.305
And as they go into a decline,

573
00:23:08.305 --> 00:23:10.907
a new civilization will start to come up.

574
00:23:10.907 --> 00:23:12.909
And you say, well, why did they go into a decline?

575
00:23:12.909 --> 00:23:15.045
And here's a fun answer to the question.

576
00:23:16.695 --> 00:23:19.349
Civilizations, like children, start out in a

577
00:23:19.349 --> 00:23:20.751
developmental phase like children.

578
00:23:20.751 --> 00:23:21.952
We try everything.

579
00:23:21.952 --> 00:23:23.720
Let's just try things for the fun of it.

580
00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.156
And then at some point, of course,

581
00:23:25.156 --> 00:23:27.257
with the parental pressures and everything,

582
00:23:27.257 --> 00:23:28.424
we get pushed into a way of,

583
00:23:28.424 --> 00:23:30.326
this is the way life is.

584
00:23:30.326 --> 00:23:33.731
And so as we leave childhood and get into maturity,

585
00:23:33.731 --> 00:23:35.366
we get, what we would say,

586
00:23:35.366 --> 00:23:38.168
rigid beliefs about this is the way life is.

587
00:23:38.168 --> 00:23:40.556
This is the law, it's rigid.

588
00:23:40.556 --> 00:23:42.939
While children are out there pushing the limits,

589
00:23:42.939 --> 00:23:45.141
parents are holding the limits saying,

590
00:23:45.141 --> 00:23:46.810
this is just the way it is.

591
00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:49.846
Well, there's a little problem with rigidity,

592
00:23:49.846 --> 00:23:53.149
and that is nothing in the universe is rigid

593
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:55.551
and stays the same, nothing.

594
00:23:55.551 --> 00:23:57.753
So the concept that you can have a civilization

595
00:23:57.753 --> 00:23:59.724
say we're going to stay exactly

596
00:23:59.724 --> 00:24:02.459
the same way as we are, is like--

597
00:24:02.459 --> 00:24:04.961
<v Voiceover>Creates a lot of resistance, that's for sure.</v>

598
00:24:04.961 --> 00:24:07.431
<v ->And a lot of force to keep the universe from doing that.</v>

599
00:24:07.431 --> 00:24:08.532
So what does it lead to?

600
00:24:08.532 --> 00:24:11.368
It says as civilization mature, then become rigid,

601
00:24:11.368 --> 00:24:12.703
they run and operate for a while,

602
00:24:12.703 --> 00:24:16.938
but then their rigidity creates challenges,

603
00:24:17.978 --> 00:24:19.710
because you're not allowing the bending

604
00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:20.877
and the movement, the evolution.

605
00:24:20.877 --> 00:24:22.980
And the challenges start to build up.

606
00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.716
And when the challenges get to a certain level,

607
00:24:25.716 --> 00:24:28.953
it signals the decline of the old, rigid way of thinking,

608
00:24:28.953 --> 00:24:30.887
and the birth of a bunch of new people,

609
00:24:30.887 --> 00:24:33.623
creative minorities, saying, what other way

610
00:24:33.623 --> 00:24:35.391
can we survive and live in this world?

611
00:24:35.391 --> 00:24:37.093
And generate all new ideas,

612
00:24:37.093 --> 00:24:39.496
and they become the birthing of a new civilization

613
00:24:39.496 --> 00:24:41.264
as the old one declines.

614
00:24:41.264 --> 00:24:42.532
So, what we talk about right now is

615
00:24:42.532 --> 00:24:44.870
we started with animism, spirit and matter,

616
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.736
one and the same, can't separate them.

617
00:24:46.736 --> 00:24:49.138
Go into polytheism, separate spirit,

618
00:24:49.138 --> 00:24:51.842
and get many different gods to it,

619
00:24:51.842 --> 00:24:53.977
and the spirits live on the planet.

620
00:24:53.977 --> 00:24:57.146
So Mount Olympus, it was really some place on the planet,

621
00:24:57.146 --> 00:24:59.216
somewhere, the gods were here.

622
00:25:00.536 --> 00:25:03.085
When polytheism started to fail,

623
00:25:03.085 --> 00:25:05.721
a new civilization started to take over.

624
00:25:05.721 --> 00:25:09.026
And the new civilization is called monotheism,

625
00:25:09.026 --> 00:25:13.013
and monotheism brings all the ideas of spirit from the past,

626
00:25:13.013 --> 00:25:14.864
and different gods, and tried to bring them together

627
00:25:14.864 --> 00:25:16.033
to make a new vision.

628
00:25:16.033 --> 00:25:17.134
So, what's the new vision?

629
00:25:17.134 --> 00:25:19.636
Yes, spirit is separate from the material world,

630
00:25:19.636 --> 00:25:21.071
but now guess what?

631
00:25:21.071 --> 00:25:23.607
Now the spirit's not even on this planet anymore.

632
00:25:23.607 --> 00:25:27.564
Spirit's somewhere else, and it's overriding everything.

633
00:25:27.564 --> 00:25:29.880
And it's only one spirit,

634
00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.014
and it doesn't even exist here anymore.

635
00:25:32.014 --> 00:25:34.951
And then what the belief of the civilization was,

636
00:25:34.951 --> 00:25:37.454
well, how did monotheism answer the questions

637
00:25:37.454 --> 00:25:38.789
that then shape the civilization?

638
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:39.723
And the answer is, well,

639
00:25:39.723 --> 00:25:41.258
we got here through divine intervention,

640
00:25:41.258 --> 00:25:43.026
so God infused us with life.

641
00:25:43.026 --> 00:25:47.109
That's David and Michelangelo picture,

642
00:25:47.109 --> 00:25:48.716
touching

643
00:25:48.716 --> 00:25:50.335
God and finger, stuff like that.

644
00:25:50.335 --> 00:25:51.735
We got infused with life.

645
00:25:51.735 --> 00:25:52.735
You say yeah, but...

646
00:25:54.305 --> 00:25:55.471
why are we here?

647
00:25:55.471 --> 00:25:57.139
And the answer is, well, you know what,

648
00:25:57.139 --> 00:25:59.810
as it turns out, we really don't want to be here.

649
00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:01.845
We really want to be over to that invisible place

650
00:26:01.845 --> 00:26:03.513
where all that spiritual stuff is happening,

651
00:26:03.513 --> 00:26:05.148
but we're not ready to go.

652
00:26:05.148 --> 00:26:07.984
So this is a playground where

653
00:26:07.984 --> 00:26:10.219
we play out plays of morality.

654
00:26:10.219 --> 00:26:11.355
And what was the point?

655
00:26:11.355 --> 00:26:12.823
This was a testing point.

656
00:26:12.823 --> 00:26:15.359
If you do okay on this physical plane,

657
00:26:15.359 --> 00:26:18.462
then you will be allowed to go to the other place.

658
00:26:18.462 --> 00:26:20.864
So the thing is, here's the world that's

659
00:26:20.864 --> 00:26:23.634
based on material and spiritual, and guess what?

660
00:26:23.634 --> 00:26:26.469
We discard the material because

661
00:26:26.469 --> 00:26:28.304
that's the thing that's damned.

662
00:26:28.304 --> 00:26:30.673
If you get trapped in the material realm,

663
00:26:30.673 --> 00:26:33.810
that's keeping you from going to that spiritual realm.

664
00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:35.945
So we separated matter and spirit so much

665
00:26:35.945 --> 00:26:37.547
that spirit doesn't exist here.

666
00:26:37.547 --> 00:26:40.183
And our mission here is only to go there.

667
00:26:40.183 --> 00:26:41.618
So how do you do that?

668
00:26:41.618 --> 00:26:42.618
How do you make the best of it?

669
00:26:42.618 --> 00:26:43.686
And the answer is we live by the

670
00:26:43.686 --> 00:26:46.522
laws of the scripture and the Bible, okay?

671
00:26:46.522 --> 00:26:50.076
So we buy into this, and the world goes pretty good,

672
00:26:51.261 --> 00:26:54.234
under monotheism, except for there's a problem.

673
00:26:54.234 --> 00:26:58.175
And that is, the church, in running this civilization,

674
00:26:58.175 --> 00:27:01.437
claims the concept of absolute knowledge.

675
00:27:01.437 --> 00:27:04.507
Meaning, that their truths are the truths.

676
00:27:04.507 --> 00:27:07.377
And no other truths can question that.

677
00:27:07.377 --> 00:27:10.696
And if you do question that truth, well...

678
00:27:11.882 --> 00:27:13.216
I love it, it's primal example of

679
00:27:13.216 --> 00:27:15.051
what's called the kangaroo court.

680
00:27:15.051 --> 00:27:16.921
In other words, you challenge the church,

681
00:27:16.921 --> 00:27:19.088
and they pull you into the inquisition court,

682
00:27:19.088 --> 00:27:21.324
I don't care who your lawyer is,

683
00:27:21.324 --> 00:27:22.392
<v Voiceover>You lose.</v>

684
00:27:22.392 --> 00:27:24.527
<v ->You're not making it through that court.</v>

685
00:27:24.527 --> 00:27:25.695
And the reason is this,

686
00:27:25.695 --> 00:27:29.666
because, if anything was found to be untrue,

687
00:27:29.666 --> 00:27:33.236
and was proven to be untrue, any simple little fact,

688
00:27:33.236 --> 00:27:37.023
then the concept of absolute knowledge falls out.

689
00:27:38.107 --> 00:27:40.410
So the church protects absolute knowledge by what?

690
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:42.178
Preventing any new knowledge from coming in.

691
00:27:42.178 --> 00:27:43.046
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

692
00:27:43.046 --> 00:27:45.115
<v ->And that was called the inquisition, okay?</v>

693
00:27:45.115 --> 00:27:46.316
So, the church is running this but

694
00:27:46.316 --> 00:27:47.850
here's where the problem comes down.

695
00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:49.118
It's just inevitable.

696
00:27:50.628 --> 00:27:53.457
Knowledge is power, absolute knowledge

697
00:27:53.457 --> 00:27:55.525
is absolute power,

698
00:27:55.525 --> 00:27:58.996
And absolute power absolutely corrupts.

699
00:27:58.996 --> 00:28:01.265
The church lost its mission.

700
00:28:01.265 --> 00:28:02.031
While they were claiming,

701
00:28:02.031 --> 00:28:04.066
let's all go up to the spiritual heaven

702
00:28:04.066 --> 00:28:05.902
and let go of the material plane,

703
00:28:05.902 --> 00:28:06.436
they were the one that were

704
00:28:06.436 --> 00:28:08.671
collecting the most of the material plane.

705
00:28:08.671 --> 00:28:10.541
They were taking the money and all the

706
00:28:10.541 --> 00:28:13.076
proceeds of this material plane

707
00:28:13.076 --> 00:28:14.343
and trading and bartering

708
00:28:14.343 --> 00:28:16.446
that for your ticket to go to the other place.

709
00:28:16.446 --> 00:28:17.180
<v Voiceover>Absolutely corruption.</v>

710
00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.782
<v ->Absolute corruption.</v>

711
00:28:18.782 --> 00:28:22.185
That led people to be a little more skeptical at some point,

712
00:28:22.185 --> 00:28:25.488
and ultimately led to the Protestant Reformation that said

713
00:28:25.488 --> 00:28:28.324
maybe this isn't completely the whole story.

714
00:28:28.324 --> 00:28:31.495
And the Protestants brought back materialism.

715
00:28:31.495 --> 00:28:34.598
Because the church said that matter is damned.

716
00:28:34.598 --> 00:28:37.634
Your connection to matter is keeping you from going there.

717
00:28:37.634 --> 00:28:40.237
And the Protestants brought back materialism and said this:

718
00:28:40.237 --> 00:28:44.107
if God loves you, he will then reward you with matter.

719
00:28:44.107 --> 00:28:47.812
So your success in the material realm

720
00:28:47.812 --> 00:28:51.181
could be considered your success in the spiritual realm

721
00:28:51.181 --> 00:28:52.348
because God is giving you this.

722
00:28:52.348 --> 00:28:55.385
So, we go from monotheism,

723
00:28:55.385 --> 00:28:57.987
which said that matter is damned and

724
00:28:57.987 --> 00:28:59.256
you only want to go to the spiritual world.

725
00:28:59.256 --> 00:29:02.893
Then Protestant, changes that a bit and says

726
00:29:02.893 --> 00:29:05.661
material's not so bad, you can have some of that stuff.

727
00:29:05.661 --> 00:29:07.697
It didn't change civilization because the answers

728
00:29:07.697 --> 00:29:09.465
were, pretty still, the same one,

729
00:29:09.465 --> 00:29:12.802
divine intervention, living out plays moralidly,

730
00:29:12.802 --> 00:29:15.272
living, quoting the scriptures, same.

731
00:29:15.272 --> 00:29:16.773
Civilization didn't change,

732
00:29:16.773 --> 00:29:19.875
but people started questioning the truths.

733
00:29:19.875 --> 00:29:21.945
And the truths were

734
00:29:21.945 --> 00:29:25.349
questioned until 1859.

735
00:29:25.349 --> 00:29:27.684
Because that's when Charles Darwin came in,

736
00:29:27.684 --> 00:29:29.285
with the theory of evolution.

737
00:29:29.285 --> 00:29:30.686
And what was relevant about this?

738
00:29:30.686 --> 00:29:32.958
Well, the world was facing challenges,

739
00:29:32.958 --> 00:29:35.858
the corruption of the church had precipitated.

740
00:29:35.858 --> 00:29:37.861
So that meant civilization was in a state of

741
00:29:37.861 --> 00:29:40.663
turmoil and upheaval, looking for some new answers.

742
00:29:40.663 --> 00:29:42.731
And science came on to the realm

743
00:29:42.731 --> 00:29:44.534
and provided some new answers.

744
00:29:44.534 --> 00:29:46.202
And the first thing that came in

745
00:29:46.202 --> 00:29:49.405
was the concept of genesis.

746
00:29:49.405 --> 00:29:53.109
That vision of God instilling life into us because

747
00:29:53.109 --> 00:29:54.711
Darwin came up with something that the

748
00:29:54.711 --> 00:29:55.879
average person on the street

749
00:29:55.879 --> 00:29:57.680
could so easily comprehend,

750
00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.783
and it didn't seem magic at that point.

751
00:29:59.783 --> 00:30:01.484
He came up with the theory of evolution.

752
00:30:01.484 --> 00:30:03.853
He said two parents mate,

753
00:30:03.853 --> 00:30:05.021
they make a bunch of offsprings,

754
00:30:05.021 --> 00:30:05.789
and ever now and then,

755
00:30:05.789 --> 00:30:07.990
one of the offspring's kind of weird,

756
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:10.127
and moves off in a different direction.

757
00:30:10.127 --> 00:30:11.528
And if you would make those offsprings,

758
00:30:11.528 --> 00:30:13.830
then it would go off further in a different direction.

759
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:17.614
So, the relevance of the people in the 1850's was

760
00:30:17.614 --> 00:30:21.604
pre-television, pre-Gameboy, most people's entertainment

761
00:30:21.604 --> 00:30:24.541
was breeding plants and animals.

762
00:30:24.541 --> 00:30:26.576
So, everyone is familiar.

763
00:30:26.576 --> 00:30:27.477
You take two parents, you breed them,

764
00:30:27.477 --> 00:30:29.178
you get a litter of something,

765
00:30:29.178 --> 00:30:30.647
and you're also familiar with,

766
00:30:30.647 --> 00:30:32.982
every now and then, the weirdo happens.

767
00:30:32.982 --> 00:30:34.851
And so, when Darwin took that image that

768
00:30:34.851 --> 00:30:36.553
everybody was familiar with and said,

769
00:30:36.553 --> 00:30:40.157
so push that weirdo idea a number of generation,

770
00:30:40.157 --> 00:30:42.391
and all of a sudden, a new species come.

771
00:30:42.391 --> 00:30:45.194
Well, everybody said, that had to make more sense

772
00:30:45.194 --> 00:30:48.631
than God created earth in seven days.

773
00:30:48.631 --> 00:30:52.001
And this was the breaking of the back

774
00:30:52.001 --> 00:30:54.604
of the previous civilization monotheism because

775
00:30:54.604 --> 00:30:56.939
new answers started coming in.

776
00:30:56.939 --> 00:30:58.775
And the new answers to the questions

777
00:30:58.775 --> 00:31:01.110
were based on science's view.

778
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.079
And people had more trust in science as

779
00:31:03.079 --> 00:31:05.515
a truth provider than they did the church.

780
00:31:05.515 --> 00:31:08.418
So, in the previous civilization, monotheism,

781
00:31:08.418 --> 00:31:10.253
yes, they answered the perennial questions,

782
00:31:10.253 --> 00:31:12.122
but if you had any question about life,

783
00:31:12.122 --> 00:31:13.190
where would you go?

784
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:14.357
Who was your truth provider?

785
00:31:14.357 --> 00:31:16.125
You go to the priest.

786
00:31:16.125 --> 00:31:19.897
But after science came in with new answers,

787
00:31:19.897 --> 00:31:22.932
and the people as a group started to say,

788
00:31:24.262 --> 00:31:27.203
I accept those, more than the previous generation.

789
00:31:27.203 --> 00:31:29.238
And so what were the answers that science came up with?

790
00:31:29.238 --> 00:31:31.141
Well, how did we get here?

791
00:31:31.141 --> 00:31:34.343
Random mutation, yeah, well I can see that.

792
00:31:34.343 --> 00:31:37.446
I mated plants and animals, that makes a lot of sense.

793
00:31:37.446 --> 00:31:39.515
Why are we here?

794
00:31:39.515 --> 00:31:40.851
Well, there's absolutely no reason.

795
00:31:40.851 --> 00:31:42.952
Why, we're here because it was an accident of genetics.

796
00:31:42.952 --> 00:31:45.121
It was like shaking genetic dice,

797
00:31:45.121 --> 00:31:47.006
it just turned out that way.

798
00:31:49.166 --> 00:31:51.060
Basically, then science put a little caveat,

799
00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.095
we don't know why we're here,

800
00:31:52.095 --> 00:31:54.865
but while we're here, our mission is to reproduce,

801
00:31:54.865 --> 00:31:56.800
because that would the Darwinian drive

802
00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.101
for taking over reproduction.

803
00:31:59.101 --> 00:32:01.437
And then, how do you make the best of it?

804
00:32:03.127 --> 00:32:04.707
This is the killer.

805
00:32:04.707 --> 00:32:06.893
Because science came up with a story,

806
00:32:08.044 --> 00:32:11.346
based on Thomas Malthus that,

807
00:32:11.346 --> 00:32:15.118
animals breed faster than plant life,

808
00:32:15.118 --> 00:32:17.453
so that a farmer growing animals,

809
00:32:17.453 --> 00:32:19.755
the population would double every year.

810
00:32:19.755 --> 00:32:21.691
But a farmer growing corn,

811
00:32:21.691 --> 00:32:24.494
is not going to double the yield of corn every year.

812
00:32:24.494 --> 00:32:25.828
And why is that relevant?

813
00:32:25.828 --> 00:32:27.164
Well, all of a sudden you say, wait,

814
00:32:27.164 --> 00:32:29.832
animals are growing faster than feed,

815
00:32:29.832 --> 00:32:30.800
what does that mean?

816
00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:31.901
That means at some point

817
00:32:31.901 --> 00:32:35.137
there's going to be more animals than feed.

818
00:32:35.137 --> 00:32:38.875
And this Malthusian idea was really the idea

819
00:32:38.875 --> 00:32:42.832
that we're going to run into a struggle for our survival.

820
00:32:42.832 --> 00:32:46.332
Why, because there's going to be more organisms than food.

821
00:32:47.483 --> 00:32:48.284
And so, what does that mean?

822
00:32:48.284 --> 00:32:49.686
Well, it says then if you understand

823
00:32:49.686 --> 00:32:52.655
the nature of civilization, it says then,

824
00:32:52.655 --> 00:32:54.991
inevitably, we're going to breed too many people,

825
00:32:54.991 --> 00:32:56.725
we're going to use up all the food.

826
00:32:56.725 --> 00:32:57.962
There's going to be a fight,

827
00:32:57.962 --> 00:33:00.395
and the survivor will be the fittest.

828
00:33:00.395 --> 00:33:02.432
So then I say, how do you make the best of it?

829
00:33:02.432 --> 00:33:05.669
And the answer is on this planet, well, to be the fittest

830
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:08.237
and you say, in this struggle for survival.

831
00:33:08.237 --> 00:33:11.140
The first premise of the belief system is

832
00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.676
we live in a world that's based on a struggle.

833
00:33:13.676 --> 00:33:15.177
This is a dog eat dog world,

834
00:33:15.177 --> 00:33:16.145
and how are you going to win?

835
00:33:16.145 --> 00:33:17.212
Well, you're going to be the fittest.

836
00:33:17.212 --> 00:33:18.214
Well, how are you going to do that?

837
00:33:18.214 --> 00:33:20.716
Competition, and you're going to compete.

838
00:33:20.716 --> 00:33:22.385
And you're going to beat the other guy.

839
00:33:22.385 --> 00:33:24.754
And if they die, that's okay too because

840
00:33:24.754 --> 00:33:26.655
there's too many of them anyway.

841
00:33:26.655 --> 00:33:29.392
So this whole belief of this dog eat dog world

842
00:33:29.392 --> 00:33:31.395
became a true,

843
00:33:31.395 --> 00:33:34.697
and a cultural template

844
00:33:34.697 --> 00:33:37.100
of which we live by in this world.

845
00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.367
It's very interesting.

846
00:33:38.367 --> 00:33:40.703
Charles Darwin's book was titled

847
00:33:40.703 --> 00:33:42.605
On the Origin of Species.

848
00:33:42.605 --> 00:33:44.440
And he had a subtitle,

849
00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.577
so it was On the Origin of Species or,

850
00:33:47.577 --> 00:33:50.880
The Preservation of the Favored Races

851
00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.598
in the Struggle for Survival.

852
00:33:53.717 --> 00:33:56.954
What sold the book was not on the origin of species.

853
00:33:56.954 --> 00:33:58.888
What sold the book was the subtitle,

854
00:33:58.888 --> 00:34:01.291
and that was why it was intentionally made.

855
00:34:01.291 --> 00:34:04.095
On the Preservation of the Favored Races

856
00:34:04.095 --> 00:34:05.761
in the Struggle for Survival.

857
00:34:05.761 --> 00:34:09.132
This book became a premier for governance

858
00:34:09.132 --> 00:34:10.367
because every government wanted to

859
00:34:10.367 --> 00:34:12.502
take care of its favored race, its own people.

860
00:34:12.502 --> 00:34:13.302
Well, how do you do it?

861
00:34:13.302 --> 00:34:15.572
Well, here's the instruction book of evolution.

862
00:34:15.572 --> 00:34:17.506
Says you got to be the fittest, yeah, how?

863
00:34:17.506 --> 00:34:20.743
Because you have to compete and beat the other people.

864
00:34:20.743 --> 00:34:23.212
So all of sudden it's like, my god,

865
00:34:23.212 --> 00:34:25.815
the previous civilization, monotheism,

866
00:34:25.815 --> 00:34:27.084
how do you make the best of it?

867
00:34:27.084 --> 00:34:29.819
Well, you live by the law of the scripture.

868
00:34:29.819 --> 00:34:32.256
And we say, well now, what about this new civilization,

869
00:34:32.256 --> 00:34:35.157
which is based on scientific understanding,

870
00:34:35.157 --> 00:34:37.593
which is actually called scientific materialism

871
00:34:37.593 --> 00:34:40.062
because it's based on the matter world as

872
00:34:40.062 --> 00:34:42.132
being primal over the invisible world,

873
00:34:42.132 --> 00:34:44.700
an extension of Newtonian physics.

874
00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:45.935
Well, how do you make the best of it?

875
00:34:45.935 --> 00:34:48.940
And the answer is, live by the law of the jungle.

876
00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:49.805
<v Voiceover>You win.</v>

877
00:34:49.805 --> 00:34:52.475
<v ->You win no matter what it takes to win.</v>

878
00:34:52.475 --> 00:34:54.043
So in other words, you could be the fittest

879
00:34:54.043 --> 00:34:56.545
by having a superior brain,

880
00:34:56.545 --> 00:34:58.114
or you can be the fittest by using

881
00:34:58.114 --> 00:35:00.283
an Uzi and wiping out everybody else.

882
00:35:00.283 --> 00:35:02.685
It doesn't matter, science has no morality.

883
00:35:02.685 --> 00:35:05.688
It just says whoever is standing at the end is the winner.

884
00:35:05.688 --> 00:35:07.557
So for the last

885
00:35:07.557 --> 00:35:10.259
150 years,

886
00:35:10.259 --> 00:35:12.896
we've been living in a culture with the premise that

887
00:35:12.896 --> 00:35:15.031
hey, we're disconnected from everything,

888
00:35:15.031 --> 00:35:16.699
we got here by random accident.

889
00:35:16.699 --> 00:35:18.301
We're just here living on the planet,

890
00:35:18.301 --> 00:35:19.569
use whatever you want.

891
00:35:19.569 --> 00:35:23.305
The more matter you have in a material world,

892
00:35:23.305 --> 00:35:25.541
the more successful you are.

893
00:35:25.541 --> 00:35:29.129
And to keep that matter, anything applies.

894
00:35:30.279 --> 00:35:32.614
You can kill people, you can do anything you want,

895
00:35:32.614 --> 00:35:35.585
because you're the top dog, and that's all that matters.

896
00:35:35.585 --> 00:35:38.455
Then you look at the world today and you say,

897
00:35:38.455 --> 00:35:39.722
isn't that interesting?

898
00:35:39.722 --> 00:35:42.324
Our belief systems have manifested this world.

899
00:35:42.324 --> 00:35:44.159
So we talk about our world being violent,

900
00:35:44.159 --> 00:35:46.263
how come it's so violent?

901
00:35:46.263 --> 00:35:49.132
And the answer is, it's because we believe it's violent.

902
00:35:49.132 --> 00:35:53.002
And then we activate on that belief and manifest violence

903
00:35:53.002 --> 00:35:56.071
but accept it as, oh that's scientifically valid,

904
00:35:56.071 --> 00:35:59.308
so we can go kill people, that's okay with us.

905
00:36:01.118 --> 00:36:03.479
Now guess what, we've passed through

906
00:36:03.479 --> 00:36:05.147
each of these civilizations.

907
00:36:05.147 --> 00:36:07.550
And just as the church started to fall because

908
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:09.753
it got corrupt and it didn't meet the system

909
00:36:09.753 --> 00:36:11.754
and created a lot of challenges...

910
00:36:11.754 --> 00:36:13.355
The challenges we face today,

911
00:36:13.355 --> 00:36:15.891
from the extension of scietific materialism,

912
00:36:15.891 --> 00:36:19.227
a science based on the material world as primal,

913
00:36:19.227 --> 00:36:21.298
and the invisible world as negligible

914
00:36:21.298 --> 00:36:23.332
and aren't influencing us at all,

915
00:36:23.332 --> 00:36:26.268
then we live in a world he with the most toys wins.

916
00:36:26.268 --> 00:36:28.605
Let me get the most money that I can get.

917
00:36:28.605 --> 00:36:30.740
Let me get the most land and things.

918
00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.676
So we're out there being the biggest

919
00:36:32.676 --> 00:36:34.710
and the best dogs in the world.

920
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:38.380
And the reality is, this is so completely out of alignment

921
00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:41.016
with the new version of science.

922
00:36:41.016 --> 00:36:43.654
Because science has new answers that

923
00:36:43.654 --> 00:36:47.190
completely conflict with the existing

924
00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.160
the perennial questions and answers.

925
00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.327
And why is that relevant?

926
00:36:52.327 --> 00:36:55.297
Since the answers to the questions shape civilization,

927
00:36:55.297 --> 00:36:57.600
then the new answers are going to shape it

928
00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.935
in a different way then the current answers.

929
00:36:59.935 --> 00:37:01.739
So I say, well, what's the new answers?

930
00:37:01.739 --> 00:37:05.241
The civilization we're moving into is one that...

931
00:37:05.241 --> 00:37:07.242
Number one, how did we get here?

932
00:37:07.242 --> 00:37:10.013
Not random mutations.

933
00:37:10.013 --> 00:37:11.948
Here's how it works.

934
00:37:11.948 --> 00:37:14.650
Nature introduces every new

935
00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:16.652
organism into the environment

936
00:37:16.652 --> 00:37:19.555
as a mechanism of bringing balance and harmony.

937
00:37:19.555 --> 00:37:22.024
But at some point, when we bring in a new organism,

938
00:37:22.024 --> 00:37:24.193
it itself will disrupt the harmony.

939
00:37:24.193 --> 00:37:26.730
So the new organism brought harmony,

940
00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:28.764
then set it out of balance again.

941
00:37:28.764 --> 00:37:30.834
Then nature brings in another organism,

942
00:37:30.834 --> 00:37:32.468
and this has been going on for

943
00:37:32.468 --> 00:37:35.337
a millenia, millions of years.

944
00:37:35.337 --> 00:37:37.005
And where are we?

945
00:37:37.005 --> 00:37:39.108
We're at this point that nature

946
00:37:39.108 --> 00:37:41.877
created an organism, humans,

947
00:37:41.877 --> 00:37:45.381
that could stand at the fulcrum of a seesaw.

948
00:37:45.381 --> 00:37:48.493
Where every other organism was at one end of the seesaw

949
00:37:48.493 --> 00:37:49.686
and it caused the seesaw to move this way,

950
00:37:49.686 --> 00:37:51.454
and then a new organism tried to bring it back,

951
00:37:51.454 --> 00:37:53.857
but it went back up, and the new organism...

952
00:37:53.857 --> 00:37:55.091
And every time you bring it up,

953
00:37:55.091 --> 00:37:57.593
the newer organism gets closer to the fulcrum,

954
00:37:57.593 --> 00:37:58.694
and where are we?

955
00:37:58.694 --> 00:38:02.397
Humans have one foot on each side of the fulcrum.

956
00:38:02.397 --> 00:38:03.800
And what's the relevance to that?

957
00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.169
Because as a single species,

958
00:38:06.169 --> 00:38:09.805
we tilt one way, we tilt the other way,

959
00:38:09.805 --> 00:38:13.275
and the whole of the environment shifts.

960
00:38:13.275 --> 00:38:15.277
And our job was,

961
00:38:15.277 --> 00:38:17.579
as the Native Americans knew,

962
00:38:17.579 --> 00:38:19.882
to bring harmony and live in harmony

963
00:38:19.882 --> 00:38:21.718
with nature and tend this garden.

964
00:38:21.718 --> 00:38:22.786
So guess what?

965
00:38:22.786 --> 00:38:25.454
The new vision says we didn't get here by accident,

966
00:38:25.454 --> 00:38:28.558
we got here through a process of adaptation.

967
00:38:28.558 --> 00:38:31.694
Adaptation what, to keep in balance, okay?

968
00:38:33.484 --> 00:38:34.663
Our first reason for being here is

969
00:38:34.663 --> 00:38:37.700
we were meant to bring balance to

970
00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.769
this civilization and evolution, okay?

971
00:38:41.989 --> 00:38:42.805
Why are we here?

972
00:38:42.805 --> 00:38:43.840
Tend the garden.

973
00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.741
Then you look around and you say,

974
00:38:45.741 --> 00:38:49.011
well, in scoring ourselves in garden tending,

975
00:38:49.011 --> 00:38:51.046
we have really failed, haven't we?

976
00:38:51.046 --> 00:38:52.215
<v Voiceover>Yeah, we haven't done well.</v>

977
00:38:52.215 --> 00:38:54.183
<v ->No, we've destroyed the entire foundation.</v>

978
00:38:54.183 --> 00:38:57.955
That's why the ecosystem as a web and network,

979
00:38:57.955 --> 00:39:01.825
when you punch holes into that, the web will collapse.

980
00:39:01.825 --> 00:39:04.093
Yeah, but we're at the top of the web.

981
00:39:04.093 --> 00:39:05.828
And you say, so what?

982
00:39:07.008 --> 00:39:07.629
As we write in the book,

983
00:39:07.629 --> 00:39:11.067
so what if there are no tigers out in the world anymore?

984
00:39:11.067 --> 00:39:13.236
We can always see them at the zoo.

985
00:39:13.236 --> 00:39:14.670
And the reality is, no.

986
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:16.906
Tigers had a role in the environment.

987
00:39:16.906 --> 00:39:18.140
And when you take them out of the environment,

988
00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:19.908
their role's not being accommodated.

989
00:39:19.908 --> 00:39:22.880
That means then, the environment is now out of balance.

990
00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:26.782
We have to learn to live in balance.

991
00:39:26.782 --> 00:39:27.883
<v Voiceover>So we're severely out of balance.</v>

992
00:39:27.883 --> 00:39:28.583
<v ->Yes.</v>

993
00:39:28.583 --> 00:39:30.720
<v Voiceover>And by bringing that to full circle,</v>

994
00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.589
we can see where we're headed out of pure necessity,

995
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:35.725
and the people they call the forward thinkers,

996
00:39:35.725 --> 00:39:37.960
cultural creatives, whatever you want to call it,

997
00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.396
are already on board with the vision of

998
00:39:40.396 --> 00:39:42.565
going back to restoring balance again.

999
00:39:42.565 --> 00:39:44.900
However, now we're facing

1000
00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:47.036
the letting go of

1001
00:39:47.036 --> 00:39:49.638
the perhaps, even the destruction of many of

1002
00:39:49.638 --> 00:39:51.707
the old systems and ways right now,

1003
00:39:51.707 --> 00:39:54.277
which creates that fear which stimulates our

1004
00:39:54.277 --> 00:39:57.680
current sense of survival of the fittest, and so forth.

1005
00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.181
So how do we begin?

1006
00:39:59.181 --> 00:40:00.849
Now let's talk about how we begin--

1007
00:40:00.849 --> 00:40:03.154
<v ->Well, first of all, first recognize this.</v>

1008
00:40:03.154 --> 00:40:05.321
The institutions that we build in our world,

1009
00:40:05.321 --> 00:40:07.823
the political institution, the economic institution,

1010
00:40:07.823 --> 00:40:10.559
the educational institution, the healthcare institution,

1011
00:40:10.559 --> 00:40:14.163
those institutions are based on scientific materialism.

1012
00:40:14.163 --> 00:40:16.832
The belief that genes control who we are,

1013
00:40:16.832 --> 00:40:18.467
that we're biochemical machines,

1014
00:40:18.467 --> 00:40:19.969
and with enough regulation of the

1015
00:40:19.969 --> 00:40:21.504
chemistry and the machinery,

1016
00:40:21.504 --> 00:40:23.239
then humans can control nature.

1017
00:40:23.239 --> 00:40:25.540
That is the mission statement of modern science.

1018
00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:28.044
It's been that way for 350 years.

1019
00:40:28.044 --> 00:40:30.146
It is to understand nature so that

1020
00:40:30.146 --> 00:40:31.714
we can manipulate and control it.

1021
00:40:31.714 --> 00:40:32.881
That's the vision, right?

1022
00:40:32.881 --> 00:40:34.416
Oh, we don't care what nature does,

1023
00:40:34.416 --> 00:40:36.585
we'll just make what we want.

1024
00:40:36.585 --> 00:40:37.390
And it's sort of like,

1025
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:39.989
you're living independent of nature to do that.

1026
00:40:39.989 --> 00:40:43.458
And the consequences of that are now playing out.

1027
00:40:43.458 --> 00:40:45.561
The fish are dying, the air is polluted,

1028
00:40:45.561 --> 00:40:47.630
the ground's got pharmaceuticals,

1029
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:51.534
so destructive of life, built into that everywhere.

1030
00:40:51.534 --> 00:40:52.602
We've destroyed all these things.

1031
00:40:52.602 --> 00:40:55.871
And you say, well, why aren't we making a revolution then?

1032
00:40:55.871 --> 00:40:58.641
And here comes what you brought up and it says this:

1033
00:40:58.641 --> 00:41:01.778
well, the institutions that are here were built

1034
00:41:01.778 --> 00:41:04.764
on the mission statement of the old belief system.

1035
00:41:05.881 --> 00:41:07.899
And here's, oh god, the unfortunate part.

1036
00:41:09.919 --> 00:41:13.222
Any system, be it the church, be it education,

1037
00:41:13.222 --> 00:41:15.758
be it healthcare, I don't care which one it is.

1038
00:41:15.758 --> 00:41:17.960
An institution starts out with

1039
00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.961
the mission of helping people.

1040
00:41:19.961 --> 00:41:21.583
That's what it's function was.

1041
00:41:21.583 --> 00:41:23.866
But as the mission grows and

1042
00:41:23.866 --> 00:41:26.302
the institution grows bigger,

1043
00:41:26.302 --> 00:41:28.937
there's a transition that has occurred in our world,

1044
00:41:28.937 --> 00:41:31.807
where the institution takes on a life of its own,

1045
00:41:31.807 --> 00:41:33.775
and has its own biological imperative.

1046
00:41:33.775 --> 00:41:34.877
<v Voiceover>To serve itself.</v>

1047
00:41:34.877 --> 00:41:36.078
<v ->To serve itself.</v>

1048
00:41:36.078 --> 00:41:39.014
So, is the healthcare to serve people?

1049
00:41:39.014 --> 00:41:40.983
No, the healthcare is to make money

1050
00:41:40.983 --> 00:41:42.985
for people who invested in healthcare.

1051
00:41:42.985 --> 00:41:46.289
Is education here to serve the student?

1052
00:41:46.289 --> 00:41:49.659
And the answer, as an academician, well, absolutely not.

1053
00:41:49.659 --> 00:41:50.993
It's there to sustain itself.

1054
00:41:50.993 --> 00:41:54.630
They have a budget, they want to be in the black.

1055
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:55.932
So, how do you do that?

1056
00:41:55.932 --> 00:41:58.233
You sell products, you sell yourself out,

1057
00:41:58.233 --> 00:41:59.902
and the mission of what?

1058
00:41:59.902 --> 00:42:02.272
Taking care of the people, that's secondary.

1059
00:42:02.272 --> 00:42:04.340
It's now the mission of being alive

1060
00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:05.641
and taking care of yourself.

1061
00:42:05.641 --> 00:42:08.060
The church starts out, Mother Teresa...

1062
00:42:09.457 --> 00:42:11.680
She was the epitome of what it was about.

1063
00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:14.884
Go out on the street and work with the people

1064
00:42:14.884 --> 00:42:16.652
and uplift their lives.

1065
00:42:16.652 --> 00:42:18.554
And you go, is that the mission of the church?

1066
00:42:18.554 --> 00:42:20.756
And the answer's no, the church is now so big

1067
00:42:20.756 --> 00:42:22.191
its mission is to maintain itself.

1068
00:42:22.191 --> 00:42:25.327
It's got a bank, it's got money everywhere.

1069
00:42:25.327 --> 00:42:27.129
Its mission is to take care of itself.

1070
00:42:27.129 --> 00:42:29.315
The people, oh, that was secondary.

1071
00:42:31.067 --> 00:42:32.401
We live in a world where the institutions

1072
00:42:32.401 --> 00:42:34.469
have taken on their own life.

1073
00:42:34.469 --> 00:42:35.737
And they were built on a premise

1074
00:42:35.737 --> 00:42:38.408
that is no longer real or true.

1075
00:42:38.408 --> 00:42:42.211
And they don't want to die because they're self sustaining.

1076
00:42:42.211 --> 00:42:45.815
So they won't let go even though they're killing us.

1077
00:42:45.815 --> 00:42:47.950
So, the reality is yeah, but,

1078
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:50.185
hey, it's evolution.

1079
00:42:50.185 --> 00:42:53.655
And extinction applies to, not just to the people,

1080
00:42:53.655 --> 00:42:55.991
but to the institutions that the

1081
00:42:55.991 --> 00:42:58.327
people have used to represent them.

1082
00:42:58.327 --> 00:42:59.462
And then you say, well,

1083
00:42:59.462 --> 00:43:00.863
you mean this thing is falling apart?

1084
00:43:00.863 --> 00:43:03.736
And I'm going, well yes,

1085
00:43:03.736 --> 00:43:05.536
because of a simple reason.

1086
00:43:05.536 --> 00:43:07.970
And Einstein said it, I just love it, a simple quote:

1087
00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:10.872
"You can't solve the problems with

1088
00:43:10.872 --> 00:43:13.575
the same thinking that created them."

1089
00:43:13.575 --> 00:43:17.078
The institutions that we now support,

1090
00:43:17.078 --> 00:43:20.899
government, economics, education, healthcare, religion,

1091
00:43:22.318 --> 00:43:24.520
have created the problems.

1092
00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.622
And if we sustain them,

1093
00:43:26.622 --> 00:43:28.690
they're just sustaining the problems.

1094
00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:32.394
The only realistic way out is new institutions.

1095
00:43:32.394 --> 00:43:34.196
Yeah, but how does that happened?

1096
00:43:34.196 --> 00:43:36.699
The old institutions fall.

1097
00:43:36.699 --> 00:43:37.967
So now you say, oh my god,

1098
00:43:37.967 --> 00:43:39.868
that means we have to go through this craziness.

1099
00:43:41.378 --> 00:43:43.072
There's two ways to go through craziness.

1100
00:43:44.472 --> 00:43:45.808
Let's give an earlier example because

1101
00:43:45.808 --> 00:43:48.711
since nature is fractal, I can give you a story

1102
00:43:48.711 --> 00:43:50.612
of a similar story of what we're

1103
00:43:50.612 --> 00:43:52.147
playing through right now,

1104
00:43:52.147 --> 00:43:54.002
that you can understand more simply.

1105
00:43:54.002 --> 00:43:56.818
I said, cells are the equivalent of miniature people,

1106
00:43:56.818 --> 00:43:59.456
so I say, look inside a caterpillar that's growing.

1107
00:43:59.456 --> 00:44:02.192
You got a billion cells in there, and guess what,

1108
00:44:02.192 --> 00:44:04.293
they're like people like us, they're working everyday,

1109
00:44:04.293 --> 00:44:05.928
cells in the digestive system are

1110
00:44:05.928 --> 00:44:07.996
taking the food and breaking it down,

1111
00:44:07.996 --> 00:44:09.815
and making products out of it.

1112
00:44:09.815 --> 00:44:11.235
Cells of the immune system are

1113
00:44:11.235 --> 00:44:13.535
taking their job of protecting the system.

1114
00:44:13.535 --> 00:44:15.638
Respiration systems, making sure

1115
00:44:15.638 --> 00:44:17.407
fresh oxygen is being delivered.

1116
00:44:17.407 --> 00:44:19.241
So, all these cells have jobs,

1117
00:44:19.241 --> 00:44:20.576
and the caterpillar's growing.

1118
00:44:20.576 --> 00:44:22.311
If you were in there, a reporter,

1119
00:44:22.311 --> 00:44:23.746
you'd look around and go yeah,

1120
00:44:23.746 --> 00:44:26.881
the economy's going great guns, it's growing every day,

1121
00:44:26.881 --> 00:44:29.251
everybody's working, full employment.

1122
00:44:29.251 --> 00:44:31.253
This is the kind of thing we love to see.

1123
00:44:31.253 --> 00:44:32.588
How much are we growing every day?

1124
00:44:32.588 --> 00:44:35.991
Some percent, every day, and so the economy's going great.

1125
00:44:35.991 --> 00:44:38.795
You live in that community, it's booming.

1126
00:44:38.795 --> 00:44:42.364
There's a point where the caterpillar reaches a size limit.

1127
00:44:42.364 --> 00:44:46.268
And it stops eating as much, it stops growing as much.

1128
00:44:46.268 --> 00:44:49.438
And that mean less product is coming in,

1129
00:44:49.438 --> 00:44:51.307
less work is required.

1130
00:44:51.307 --> 00:44:53.042
The cells start to recognize,

1131
00:44:53.042 --> 00:44:54.410
well, this thing's slowing down.

1132
00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:55.977
They're laying cells off,

1133
00:44:55.977 --> 00:44:58.281
the digestive system just laid off

1134
00:44:58.281 --> 00:44:59.815
a massive number of workers, why?

1135
00:44:59.815 --> 00:45:01.550
There's no food coming in.

1136
00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:02.917
And you say, well, what are these cells going to do?

1137
00:45:02.917 --> 00:45:05.354
Well, they're all milling around now going,

1138
00:45:05.354 --> 00:45:08.090
wait, this thing's falling apart.

1139
00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:09.592
And the cells are going to get scared.

1140
00:45:09.592 --> 00:45:11.793
Of course, because they live based

1141
00:45:11.793 --> 00:45:14.029
on the civilization of their community.

1142
00:45:14.029 --> 00:45:16.631
And when the caterpillar stops growing,

1143
00:45:16.631 --> 00:45:18.700
the community starts falling apart.

1144
00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:21.369
And so, if you were one of the stomach cells,

1145
00:45:21.369 --> 00:45:22.638
or one of the respiratory cells,

1146
00:45:22.638 --> 00:45:25.908
you'd go, my job security is falling apart.

1147
00:45:25.908 --> 00:45:28.043
Oh my god, we're not going to have enough food,

1148
00:45:28.043 --> 00:45:29.110
what are we going to do?

1149
00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:29.928
And fear...

1150
00:45:30.979 --> 00:45:33.515
But in the midst of this falling apart,

1151
00:45:33.515 --> 00:45:34.850
cells are commiting suicide,

1152
00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:37.519
which is called apoptosis in the biological world.

1153
00:45:37.519 --> 00:45:40.123
And the thing, this structure is falling apart,

1154
00:45:40.123 --> 00:45:43.025
and a lot of people are pulling out their cilia,

1155
00:45:43.025 --> 00:45:45.194
going oh my god, it's the end of the world.

1156
00:45:45.194 --> 00:45:47.930
In among them are other cells that,

1157
00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:50.509
genetically identical to them, no different.

1158
00:45:51.639 --> 00:45:52.868
But they think differently,

1159
00:45:52.868 --> 00:45:56.038
they respond to the signals differently.

1160
00:45:56.038 --> 00:45:59.074
And they have this wonderful name called imaginal cells.

1161
00:45:59.074 --> 00:46:00.642
And what are the imaginal cells?

1162
00:46:00.642 --> 00:46:03.144
They're cells that are saying we can

1163
00:46:03.144 --> 00:46:05.415
create something far better than this.

1164
00:46:05.415 --> 00:46:08.050
And what they do is start to organize the other cells,

1165
00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:11.087
saying look, let's restructure this thing,

1166
00:46:11.087 --> 00:46:11.954
because we can make something

1167
00:46:11.954 --> 00:46:14.356
far better than this caterpillar.

1168
00:46:15.766 --> 00:46:17.393
The imaginal cells start organizing the

1169
00:46:17.393 --> 00:46:20.162
community to create the butterfly.

1170
00:46:20.162 --> 00:46:23.499
So from the destruction of the caterpillar emerges

1171
00:46:23.499 --> 00:46:27.336
the much more advanced evolution of a butterfly.

1172
00:46:29.106 --> 00:46:30.705
What this is relevant is this,

1173
00:46:30.705 --> 00:46:33.408
we're living in a caterpillar world,

1174
00:46:33.408 --> 00:46:36.044
that is trying to emerge into a butterfly.

1175
00:46:36.044 --> 00:46:36.812
Well, how are you going to do that?

1176
00:46:36.812 --> 00:46:39.015
And the answer is the old structures

1177
00:46:39.015 --> 00:46:40.816
feeding the caterpillar are not

1178
00:46:40.816 --> 00:46:43.291
supporting the evidence of a butterfly.

1179
00:46:44.352 --> 00:46:48.122
And therefore, you have two choices in this world right now.

1180
00:46:48.122 --> 00:46:50.993
You can retain your caterpillar status,

1181
00:46:50.993 --> 00:46:53.762
and go, oh my god, the sky is falling,

1182
00:46:53.762 --> 00:46:56.198
and be in fear, and get sick because that

1183
00:46:56.198 --> 00:46:57.966
is what the biology of belief reveals.

1184
00:46:57.966 --> 00:47:01.436
Once you're in fear, it generates illness in the system.

1185
00:47:01.436 --> 00:47:03.606
Or you can say,

1186
00:47:03.606 --> 00:47:05.562
rather than focusing on the

1187
00:47:05.562 --> 00:47:09.178
demise of the butterfly, I'd rather contribute to the

1188
00:47:09.178 --> 00:47:12.574
evolution and development of the new structure.

1189
00:47:12.574 --> 00:47:15.884
The caterpillar is going, I want to build a butterfly.

1190
00:47:15.884 --> 00:47:16.351
Why?

1191
00:47:16.351 --> 00:47:19.087
Because if I become active and positive

1192
00:47:19.087 --> 00:47:20.822
in the process of building the butterfly,

1193
00:47:20.822 --> 00:47:23.225
I'm engaged, I'm working, we're creating the future.

1194
00:47:23.225 --> 00:47:26.361
If I sit there and bemoan the loss of the caterpillar,

1195
00:47:26.361 --> 00:47:27.762
then I'm making myself sick,

1196
00:47:27.762 --> 00:47:29.700
and everything around me, why?

1197
00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:32.677
I'm not contributing to our evolution.

1198
00:47:32.677 --> 00:47:34.803
And so, where are we?

1199
00:47:34.803 --> 00:47:36.572
We're at the demise of the

1200
00:47:36.572 --> 00:47:38.473
caterpillar stage of civilization,

1201
00:47:38.473 --> 00:47:40.675
and the rise of the butterfly.

1202
00:47:40.675 --> 00:47:42.744
The creative minorities are out there,

1203
00:47:42.744 --> 00:47:45.113
creating all new technologies that are

1204
00:47:45.113 --> 00:47:47.582
not going to threaten our existence.

1205
00:47:47.582 --> 00:47:51.153
New forms of energy, new forms of creating health,

1206
00:47:51.153 --> 00:47:54.089
the whole healthcare system, is detritus,

1207
00:47:54.089 --> 00:47:55.591
is the way I look at it, it's dead,

1208
00:47:55.591 --> 00:47:57.893
and killing people on the way down.

1209
00:47:57.893 --> 00:48:00.285
I hate to say it, but it's a simple fact.

1210
00:48:00.285 --> 00:48:00.896
<v Voiceover>True.</v>

1211
00:48:00.896 --> 00:48:03.865
<v ->When you look at the data, iatrogenic illness,</v>

1212
00:48:03.865 --> 00:48:06.934
meaning medicine-related illness, meaning,

1213
00:48:06.934 --> 00:48:08.437
I go to the doctor with a problem A,

1214
00:48:08.437 --> 00:48:12.441
get treated, and die from medical-related illness B.

1215
00:48:12.441 --> 00:48:14.443
Iatrogenic illness is the leading cause

1216
00:48:14.443 --> 00:48:16.145
of death in our civilization.

1217
00:48:16.145 --> 00:48:17.579
Yes we need healthcare reform,

1218
00:48:17.579 --> 00:48:18.915
we need a whole new vision,

1219
00:48:18.915 --> 00:48:21.650
without the institutions that

1220
00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:24.185
have been promoting the old way.

1221
00:48:24.185 --> 00:48:26.921
So when they fall apart, I sit here going,

1222
00:48:26.921 --> 00:48:28.356
okay, cool, why?

1223
00:48:28.356 --> 00:48:32.093
Because now, it's another stumbling block out of the way

1224
00:48:32.093 --> 00:48:35.163
that is preventing us from making our evolution.

1225
00:48:35.163 --> 00:48:37.366
But I have to sit here and tell you the truth,

1226
00:48:37.366 --> 00:48:40.535
will we be successful in this evolution?

1227
00:48:40.535 --> 00:48:42.371
And the answer is hey...

1228
00:48:42.371 --> 00:48:45.374
The answer to that question is not in yet.

1229
00:48:45.374 --> 00:48:47.309
We may or may not make it.

1230
00:48:47.309 --> 00:48:50.412
We're at a pivotal moment of our evolution, right now.

1231
00:48:50.412 --> 00:48:53.816
But this is why I'm excited about the new book.

1232
00:48:53.816 --> 00:48:54.749
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1233
00:48:54.749 --> 00:48:57.619
<v ->Because the new book says up to our history now,</v>

1234
00:48:57.619 --> 00:49:00.588
we've just been passive elements in our civilization.

1235
00:49:00.588 --> 00:49:03.325
Things happen to us, just comes out of the sky.

1236
00:49:03.325 --> 00:49:06.762
Forces unbeknownst to me are controlling my life.

1237
00:49:06.762 --> 00:49:09.464
The new biology turns all this around and reveals,

1238
00:49:09.464 --> 00:49:12.568
my god, we've been powerful people forever,

1239
00:49:12.568 --> 00:49:15.538
except we have been programmed to become powerless.

1240
00:49:15.538 --> 00:49:18.807
We have lost our power during our childhood

1241
00:49:18.807 --> 00:49:21.210
developmental experiences from in utero,

1242
00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:23.445
to the first six years of our lives.

1243
00:49:23.445 --> 00:49:24.446
What's this all about?

1244
00:49:24.446 --> 00:49:25.981
Well, in the biology of belief,

1245
00:49:25.981 --> 00:49:29.951
we talk about the fact that a child is programmed,

1246
00:49:29.951 --> 00:49:31.353
the mind of a child is programmed,

1247
00:49:31.353 --> 00:49:34.322
and the mind controls the genes and the behavior,

1248
00:49:34.322 --> 00:49:37.292
and the mind of a child is programmed by the experiences

1249
00:49:37.292 --> 00:49:40.128
that in utero to the first six years.

1250
00:49:40.128 --> 00:49:42.062
And then I go back and I say,

1251
00:49:42.062 --> 00:49:43.999
although I wrote this very recently,

1252
00:49:43.999 --> 00:49:47.936
this is not a new idea, these are thousand years.

1253
00:49:47.936 --> 00:49:50.506
Thousand years ago, the Jesuits was...

1254
00:49:50.506 --> 00:49:52.841
Today, they still say the same thing:

1255
00:49:52.841 --> 00:49:55.556
you give me the child,

1256
00:49:55.556 --> 00:49:57.846
and I will show you the man.

1257
00:49:57.846 --> 00:49:59.281
Or another way of saying that,

1258
00:49:59.281 --> 00:50:01.682
you give me the child until it's six or seven,

1259
00:50:01.682 --> 00:50:04.836
and it will belong to the church for the rest of its life.

1260
00:50:06.188 --> 00:50:07.222
What are they talking about?

1261
00:50:07.222 --> 00:50:08.890
The biology of belief.

1262
00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:11.794
And what they knew about the biology of belief

1263
00:50:11.794 --> 00:50:15.063
was that the biology

1264
00:50:15.063 --> 00:50:16.598
of belief is that

1265
00:50:16.598 --> 00:50:19.200
our perceptions and beliefs about life

1266
00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.769
control our genetics and our behavior.

1267
00:50:21.769 --> 00:50:25.541
And they knew by giving a child and teaching it

1268
00:50:25.541 --> 00:50:26.942
what perceptions it should have,

1269
00:50:26.942 --> 00:50:28.243
and what beliefs it should have,

1270
00:50:28.243 --> 00:50:30.480
they control the fate of that child.

1271
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:35.089
Do you think this idea just disappeared?

1272
00:50:35.089 --> 00:50:37.353
The Jesuits knew that, and that was nice,

1273
00:50:37.353 --> 00:50:39.347
but we don't care about that.

1274
00:50:39.347 --> 00:50:42.990
This belief has been known about for that long.

1275
00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:45.961
And I'm just going to give a brief summary about

1276
00:50:45.961 --> 00:50:48.029
it right here and go like this,

1277
00:50:48.029 --> 00:50:50.232
if we're creating our lives and creating the world

1278
00:50:50.232 --> 00:50:51.633
as the biology of beliefs says,

1279
00:50:51.633 --> 00:50:53.501
and I say let's go out and do a survey of the entire

1280
00:50:53.501 --> 00:50:56.338
seven billion people on this population on the world,

1281
00:50:56.338 --> 00:50:59.141
and I say, let's do a survey, what do you want?

1282
00:50:59.141 --> 00:51:01.009
And the answers will inevitably come back,

1283
00:51:01.009 --> 00:51:04.436
I want peace, freedom, a job,

1284
00:51:04.436 --> 00:51:07.776
a place to live, some food, that's all I want.

1285
00:51:08.986 --> 00:51:11.987
If 90% or more of the population would

1286
00:51:11.987 --> 00:51:13.388
answer this question that way,

1287
00:51:13.388 --> 00:51:16.091
which I believe it would, makes you think,

1288
00:51:16.091 --> 00:51:17.391
how come the world we live in is

1289
00:51:17.391 --> 00:51:19.744
so filled with crime and violence and guns and

1290
00:51:21.684 --> 00:51:22.964
people ripping off everybody,

1291
00:51:22.964 --> 00:51:24.399
and this is the way of life.

1292
00:51:24.399 --> 00:51:26.334
How did that manifest in the world

1293
00:51:26.334 --> 00:51:27.636
where if we're creating the world,

1294
00:51:27.636 --> 00:51:29.138
and 90% of us want this world.

1295
00:51:29.138 --> 00:51:30.706
And the answer is this,

1296
00:51:30.706 --> 00:51:34.210
because that knowledge of programming

1297
00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:37.680
was always maintained by the people in charge.

1298
00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.949
Be it the church when they were doing it,

1299
00:51:39.949 --> 00:51:42.283
or whoever they passed it to next.

1300
00:51:42.283 --> 00:51:45.487
The concept of if I can program your child,

1301
00:51:45.487 --> 00:51:47.857
I can control that child.

1302
00:51:47.857 --> 00:51:50.291
So it says yeah, 90 plus percent

1303
00:51:50.291 --> 00:51:52.129
of us want peace in this world,

1304
00:51:52.129 --> 00:51:53.961
and we live in a world without peace,

1305
00:51:53.961 --> 00:51:54.896
what does that mean?

1306
00:51:54.896 --> 00:51:58.434
A small percentage of people have manipulated

1307
00:51:58.434 --> 00:52:01.904
the beliefs, programmed the individuals,

1308
00:52:01.904 --> 00:52:04.506
given up our own power,

1309
00:52:04.506 --> 00:52:06.575
and bought their belief system,

1310
00:52:06.575 --> 00:52:09.655
and now manifest and live in their world.

1311
00:52:09.655 --> 00:52:11.513
And what's the evolution about?

1312
00:52:11.513 --> 00:52:13.983
The evolution that's happening right now?

1313
00:52:13.983 --> 00:52:17.253
Is the understanding that we are powerful people,

1314
00:52:17.253 --> 00:52:19.955
and that by rewriting our belief system,

1315
00:52:19.955 --> 00:52:22.224
and understanding who we really are,

1316
00:52:22.224 --> 00:52:25.827
we can empower ourselves.

1317
00:52:25.827 --> 00:52:29.431
And when the population en masse understand this,

1318
00:52:29.431 --> 00:52:31.600
then the beliefs and desires of

1319
00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.537
that population will manifest itself.

1320
00:52:34.537 --> 00:52:36.305
And how will that happen?

1321
00:52:36.305 --> 00:52:39.807
When the small percent that runs the institutions,

1322
00:52:39.807 --> 00:52:43.178
that shape us, lose their power

1323
00:52:43.178 --> 00:52:45.379
as we gain our power,

1324
00:52:45.379 --> 00:52:46.814
that is the evolution.

1325
00:52:46.814 --> 00:52:49.451
So, the most wonderful part is,

1326
00:52:49.451 --> 00:52:51.820
the evolution that is so promising and

1327
00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:53.789
so hopeful is based on us.

1328
00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:56.724
And we have to recover and regain

1329
00:52:56.724 --> 00:52:58.726
who we really are.

1330
00:52:58.726 --> 00:53:00.294
Because when we do that,

1331
00:53:00.294 --> 00:53:02.330
then we manifest the future.

1332
00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:05.167
And I see how beautiful it is, why?

1333
00:53:05.167 --> 00:53:07.469
Because I've traveled through that body,

1334
00:53:07.469 --> 00:53:11.206
with 50 trillion citizens, and saw,

1335
00:53:11.206 --> 00:53:14.442
oh my god, look how they spend money in here.

1336
00:53:14.442 --> 00:53:15.945
Look how they save money in here,

1337
00:53:15.945 --> 00:53:17.379
they do it differently.

1338
00:53:17.379 --> 00:53:19.247
And look how it works, and it says,

1339
00:53:19.247 --> 00:53:22.150
the answers for us

1340
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:24.286
are already worked out.

1341
00:53:24.286 --> 00:53:27.723
Cells have politics, economics, healthcare,

1342
00:53:27.723 --> 00:53:31.593
defense postures, everything that we need.

1343
00:53:31.593 --> 00:53:32.827
And they've done it.

1344
00:53:32.827 --> 00:53:34.529
And all we have to do is say,

1345
00:53:34.529 --> 00:53:36.964
can we follow what you did?

1346
00:53:36.964 --> 00:53:39.784
And the answer is that's what fractals evolution.

1347
00:53:41.803 --> 00:53:43.639
<v ->Bruce is lecturing around the world on</v>

1348
00:53:43.639 --> 00:53:45.607
spontaneous evolution at present,

1349
00:53:45.607 --> 00:53:47.276
so you may be able to hear him live

1350
00:53:47.276 --> 00:53:50.578
if you check into his schedule on his site, BruceLipton.com.

1351
00:53:50.578 --> 00:53:52.246
Meanwhile, you can pick up a copy of

1352
00:53:52.246 --> 00:53:54.984
Spontaneous Evolution at any major book seller.

1353
00:53:54.984 --> 00:53:57.466
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
