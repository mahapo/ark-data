00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>Christine Arena has
been a managing director

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.690 align:middle line:84%
and strategic director
in the business world,

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.630 align:middle line:84%
as well as co-founding
a variety of businesses.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.100 align:middle line:84%
As she observed the various
corporate strategies,

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.910 align:middle line:84%
she began to see an
interesting picture emerge.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Companies that had core values
reflecting a win-win regarding

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.560 align:middle line:84%
profits, people,
and the environment

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.160 align:middle line:90%
seemed to perform best.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.480 align:middle line:84%
She followed up this
observation by interviewing

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.100 align:middle line:84%
company CEOs committed to
high purpose business, which

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.330 align:middle line:84%
became the framework for
her book Cause For Success.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.400 align:middle line:84%
In this interview she
talks about the road

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.510 align:middle line:84%
to becoming a high
purpose company

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.984 align:middle line:84%
and how we, the consumer,
can prompt industry

00:00:36.984 --> 00:00:37.900 align:middle line:90%
toward this direction.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:47.654 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.654 --> 00:00:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>>What inspired you to
put Cause For Success

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.390 align:middle line:84%
together and analyze
these different business

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.310 align:middle line:84%
models of conscious
business practice?

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>It sounds like an
oxymoron to a lot

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.780 align:middle line:90%
of people, conscious business.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.730 align:middle line:84%
I was working for 13
years for corporations,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.490 align:middle line:84%
trying to help them
determine what people needed,

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.580 align:middle line:84%
to help them better market
their products or services,

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.840 align:middle line:90%
as the case may be.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think after
a while of trying

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.170 align:middle line:84%
to unearth these very
superficial needs that people

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.300 align:middle line:84%
had, like the need to be desired
or the need to feel powerful,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.820 align:middle line:84%
I sort of thought, you know,
what about the companies that

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.710 align:middle line:84%
are out there serving really
fundamental human needs,

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.320 align:middle line:84%
like the need to
stop global warming

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.239 align:middle line:84%
or find a cure for cancer
or stop the poverty problem?

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is there are a
lot of companies out there doing

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:84%
that, so I thought I
wanted to write about them.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>>So let's begin
at the beginning

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.160 align:middle line:84%
then and talk about
a couple of examples

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.820 align:middle line:84%
that you were particularly
inspired by that you feature

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.220 align:middle line:90%
in the Cause For Success.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I think the most
notable example in the book,

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.962 align:middle line:84%
there are several, but British
Petroleum is certainly one, BP.

00:01:56.962 --> 00:01:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's a company that's
hugely controversial.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I've been
criticized for putting them

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.270 align:middle line:84%
in the book because
people think,

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.580 align:middle line:90%
well, this is an oil giant.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a company that
releases 80.5 million tons

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.420 align:middle line:84%
of CO2 into the
atmosphere every year.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.700 align:middle line:84%
They reported 20 fatalities
among their work force

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and contractors last year
for on the job accidents.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So they're not a perfect
company with a perfect record.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.970 align:middle line:84%
But they were the
first oil giant

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.320 align:middle line:84%
to admit, when
nobody else would,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.820 align:middle line:84%
that global warming was
a real and serious threat

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and that it was incumbent upon
every company in its category

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.400 align:middle line:90%
to do something about it.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Well now, today, I
mean, the company

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.020 align:middle line:84%
has reduced its CO2
emissions by 10%.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.390 align:middle line:84%
It's become the world's leading
provider of cleaner burning

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:90%
fuels.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.990 align:middle line:84%
It's the second largest producer
of solar panels on the world.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And now, every other oil
giant is following BP's lead.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.220 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, even though
it's not a perfect company,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.420 align:middle line:84%
it's certainly a
leader in this area.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
a distinction that

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.190 align:middle line:90%
needs to be made.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.750 align:middle line:90%
You know what it is?

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.820 align:middle line:84%
I've found that there is
a new form of success,

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.610 align:middle line:84%
and that form of success
is not about perfection.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.500 align:middle line:84%
It's about the
pursuit of perfection.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.530 align:middle line:84%
It's about a continual cycle
of really tough self-evaluation

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.270 align:middle line:90%
and continual self-improvement.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And companies like BP, Hewlett
Packard, The Body Shop,

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Stonyfield Farm, the
Grameen Bank, the companies

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.620 align:middle line:84%
that I feature in this book are
all engaged in that process.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And so it really requires
companies to look themselves

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.747 align:middle line:84%
in the mirror and
assess the real impact

00:03:39.747 --> 00:03:41.330 align:middle line:84%
the whole of their
business activities

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.542 align:middle line:90%
have on the rest of the world.

00:03:43.542 --> 00:03:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And it requires
companies to answer

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.710 align:middle line:84%
a really difficult
question, which

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.070 align:middle line:84%
is, are we fundamentally helping
people or harming people?

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at the end
of the day, that's

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.710 align:middle line:84%
the question that should be
asked by every business leader.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>We didn't say
this right up front,

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.830 align:middle line:84%
which should have been said,
which is Cause For Success is

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.310 align:middle line:84%
about companies who put
their profits second

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.610 align:middle line:90%
and their purpose--

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.630 align:middle line:90%
And you call this high purpose.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.770 align:middle line:84%
--first and ended up coming
in first financially.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>>They did.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:84%
They came in first and
surpassed their competitors

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:21.112 align:middle line:84%
in the marketplace by putting
a social problem first.

00:04:21.112 --> 00:04:22.695 align:middle line:84%
And high purpose
companies are unique.

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:27.280 align:middle line:84%
They're a unique breed
because the litmus test is,

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.420 align:middle line:84%
if you removed the company's
higher purpose or its cause,

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.810 align:middle line:84%
its crusade, whether
it's a social crusade

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.170 align:middle line:84%
or an environmental
crusade, would the company

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.450 align:middle line:84%
continue to compete
as efficiently?

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.830 align:middle line:84%
For high purpose companies,
the answer is no.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.340 align:middle line:84%
If you took the green
aspect away from BP,

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I asked Lord John Brown,
the group chief executive

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.270 align:middle line:84%
of that company what would
happen if we did that.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we would
no longer be BP.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean our whole
growth strategy,

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.930 align:middle line:84%
our distinction
in the marketplace

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.670 align:middle line:84%
is contingent upon our
ability to progress

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.290 align:middle line:84%
in a social and
environmentally friendly way.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's really core
to the company.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's true for a lot more
companies than people think.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.290 align:middle line:84%
People really think that
corporations are evil,

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.900 align:middle line:90%
especially big corporations.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.130 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I have to say that
that's becoming less and less

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:84%
true because society's
putting a lot of pressure

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.220 align:middle line:90%
on companies to act better.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>Before we get into other
specific companies and what

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:33.980 align:middle line:84%
inspired them and what the
net effect ended up becoming,

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.530 align:middle line:84%
how can companies at
this point in time--

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in the oil
industry certainly

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.100 align:middle line:84%
has to know what BP is up to
and how it has benefited them.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.730 align:middle line:84%
--what do you think the
major points of resistance

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.760 align:middle line:84%
are to other companies following
suit at this time, then?

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>You know, it's like what is
the major point of resistance

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.740 align:middle line:90%
to any form of human progress?

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.340 align:middle line:90%
It's fear.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases,
it's laziness.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.400 align:middle line:90%
But fear is a big one.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'll use an example,
a controversial example.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Walmart is an
interesting company

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.756 align:middle line:90%
because it's always in the news.

00:06:09.756 --> 00:06:13.840 align:middle line:84%
It's constantly being criticized
for its negative impact

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.190 align:middle line:84%
on society, for its
treatment of employees,

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.920 align:middle line:84%
for its contribution to the
outsourcing of American jobs

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.400 align:middle line:90%
and an array of problems.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.850 align:middle line:84%
It's also responsible
for some great things.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Realistically, it
employs 10 million people

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.210 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.610 align:middle line:84%
But what's really interesting
is that that company just

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.630 align:middle line:84%
waged a very expensive
advertising campaign designed

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.820 align:middle line:84%
to refute all of the
controversy against it.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who's spoken
out against Walmart

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.610 align:middle line:84%
in the last couple
of years, and granted

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:47.693 align:middle line:90%
there are a lot of people.

00:06:47.693 --> 00:06:49.300 align:middle line:84%
There are 5,000
outstanding lawsuits

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.750 align:middle line:84%
against the company
at this time.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.190 align:middle line:84%
The company characterized
those assaults

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.550 align:middle line:90%
as urban myths, urban legends.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.480 align:middle line:84%
So they really kind
of brushed over

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.850 align:middle line:84%
a lot of those sometimes
substantive comments

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.130 align:middle line:90%
and criticisms.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's very different
if you put that example

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:90%
head to head with the Gap.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.230 align:middle line:84%
That's another company that's
topped anti-sweatshop activists

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:21.010 align:middle line:84%
lists for 20 years
practically, 10 years at least.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.410 align:middle line:84%
That company just released
a really scathing report

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.080 align:middle line:90%
about itself.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.340 align:middle line:84%
It admitted that there
were human rights problems.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.390 align:middle line:90%
There were labor problems.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.440 align:middle line:84%
There were unfair competition
problems or issues

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.980 align:middle line:84%
in its factories
that were negative.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.142 align:middle line:84%
And instead of hiding
that and pretending

00:07:41.142 --> 00:07:43.225 align:middle line:84%
like it was complying with
the law, which it was--

00:07:43.225 --> 00:07:44.820 align:middle line:90%
It was not breaking the law.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.210 align:middle line:90%
--it opened up a can of worms.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And it invited people
to go, wait a minute.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.640 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.340 align:middle line:90%
So they have to progress.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, those are two
very different examples

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.340 align:middle line:84%
of a company that's willing
to look itself in the mirror

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and admit, we're not
perfect, and we're

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.790 align:middle line:84%
going to be honest about this,
and a company that stonewalls

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.150 align:middle line:90%
and does the very opposite.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, one is on a high
purpose path, and one is not.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>And in reality, isn't there
a positive psychological impact

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.650 align:middle line:84%
when a company is
willing to admit

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.590 align:middle line:84%
the error of their
ways, their sins?

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't everybody love a
repentant sinner in life?

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>>They do.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.010 align:middle line:84%
That is a very sexy story,
the idea of rebirth,

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.570 align:middle line:84%
of rejuvenation, of waking
up and seeing the light, so

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.740 align:middle line:84%
to speak, and then
acting in accordance

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.100 align:middle line:84%
with this new perspective,
this new worldview.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.820 align:middle line:90%
That's a very powerful story.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.940 align:middle line:90%
It can rejuvenate a brand.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:49.200 align:middle line:84%
It can rejuvenate employees'
loyalty, better workforce.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.760 align:middle line:84%
It can certainly win
customer affinity,

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.840 align:middle line:84%
and help a company
to better compete.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually a
very positive process.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>>Let's go into some specific
examples of companies

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.980 align:middle line:84%
that have taken a good
long look at themselves,

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.920 align:middle line:84%
and they've confessed, and they
have changed policy procedure,

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.970 align:middle line:84%
whatever, and then look
at where it's taken them.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, a really great
example is a smaller company

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.890 align:middle line:84%
called Green Mountain
Coffee Roasters.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Green Mountain Coffee Roasters
is based in New England.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.930 align:middle line:84%
They're actually an incredibly
fast-- They're a company that's

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.275 align:middle line:84%
growing very quickly, growing
at a rate of about 16%

00:09:24.275 --> 00:09:27.880 align:middle line:84%
a year because,
about 17 years ago,

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:32.120 align:middle line:84%
the CEO of that company,
Bob Stiller, decided, gee,

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.270 align:middle line:90%
we're a gourmet coffee company.

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:37.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go visit the
coffee plantations in Guatemala

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.070 align:middle line:84%
and Mexico that
supply our beans.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.820 align:middle line:90%
So he did.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.210 align:middle line:90%
He got in a plane.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:43.900 align:middle line:84%
He went to visit some
of the plantations

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.540 align:middle line:84%
where his coffee beans
were being supplied.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.300 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, I can't speak today.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And he told me he was shocked
at the level of poverty

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:53.920 align:middle line:90%
and devastation.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.920 align:middle line:84%
He actually got
very emotional when

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.450 align:middle line:90%
he was describing this scenario.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:02.203 align:middle line:84%
He's like, people
do not realize there

00:10:02.203 --> 00:10:03.570 align:middle line:90%
were people were starving.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.390 align:middle line:84%
There were children that
were clearly uneducated,

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.670 align:middle line:84%
unable to be educated,
and not receiving

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:10.974 align:middle line:90%
any sort of healthcare.

00:10:10.974 --> 00:10:12.390 align:middle line:84%
People were living
in the streets.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:16.320 align:middle line:84%
These people, their
culture, their society,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.340 align:middle line:84%
their socioeconomic
structure has deteriorated

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:84%
because they've
been growing coffee

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.210 align:middle line:90%
for centuries, literally.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And many American and
European coffee companies

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.020 align:middle line:84%
refuse to pay them a fair
price for their beans.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:36.080 align:middle line:84%
So what it costs them to produce
coffee is not even paid for.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.000 align:middle line:84%
The price the market's
willing to bear

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.170 align:middle line:84%
does not exceed
the price of labor.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:46.430 align:middle line:84%
So that is causing major
deterioration and catastrophe.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.870 align:middle line:84%
There are millions of people
affected by this problem.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:53.300 align:middle line:84%
So Bob got back on a plane,
went back to his home base

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.270 align:middle line:84%
and told everyone, and
dedicated his company

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.455 align:middle line:84%
to being a leader in
what's called fair trade.

00:10:59.455 --> 00:11:01.760 align:middle line:84%
The fair trade movement
in the United States,

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.600 align:middle line:90%
very progressive.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.430 align:middle line:10%
Consumers should get involved.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.270 align:middle line:10%
It really-- it's about
companies standing up and going,

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:12.010 align:middle line:10%
we're going to pay people a fair
price because this is connected

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:13.700 align:middle line:10%
to so many problems,
human rights

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:10%
problems, political problems.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Bob Stiller told me it's
connected to world peace.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:90%
So this is a huge problem.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, since he's done that, his
coffee quality has increased.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.240 align:middle line:84%
His employees have become
much more loyal and happy,

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.710 align:middle line:90%
as have his consumers.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of the
world's fastest growing,

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.290 align:middle line:84%
well, the nation's fastest
growing coffee companies.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, they're
growing at about 16% a year.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.987 align:middle line:90%
That's extremely fast.

00:11:38.987 --> 00:11:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>And they're inspiring
change within the industry

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.105 align:middle line:84%
for the other coffee
providers as well.

00:11:43.105 --> 00:11:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>I mean, absolutely.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>Doesn't Starbucks even
have fair trade blends?

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:50.514 align:middle line:84%
>>Sure, now Starbucks and
Dunkin' Donuts and Procter

00:11:50.514 --> 00:11:52.180 align:middle line:84%
and Gamble's brands
are looking into it.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.780 align:middle line:90%
So I think there's movement.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.530 align:middle line:90%
But they embraced this.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Bob Stiller and
Green Mountain Coffee

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:01.370 align:middle line:84%
embraced fair
trade 16 years ago.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:02.670 align:middle line:90%
That's a long time ago.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.470 align:middle line:90%
That's before it was en vogue.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.210 align:middle line:84%
That's before anybody
else was doing it.

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And everyone looked at them
and went, you're crazy!

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.590 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Why do you care?

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.909 align:middle line:84%
And how can you
make as much money?

00:12:13.909 --> 00:12:15.450 align:middle line:84%
But he really believed
that he could,

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.970 align:middle line:84%
and he's actually proven
all the critics wrong.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>And I've met him.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm very impressed with
him as a human being.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was a person that
made these changes coming

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:26.360 align:middle line:90%
from heart.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And this heart element seems
to be a big piece that's

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.570 align:middle line:84%
been missing in the
corporate world.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>It really is.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.895 align:middle line:84%
>>Could it be coming more
toward the forefront now?

00:12:35.895 --> 00:12:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>I certainly have never--

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.810 align:middle line:84%
I was flabbergasted, surprised
to talk to people, CEOs

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.970 align:middle line:84%
or chairmen, like Ray Anderson,
the chairman of Interface

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.930 align:middle line:84%
or Bob Stiller or Anita
Roddick from the Body Shop,

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.810 align:middle line:84%
or I mean even Lord
John Brown or Debra

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Dunn from Hewlett
Packard, these people

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:58.560 align:middle line:84%
had a level of fire and
passion about this and heart.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And they expressed that
sort of moral intelligence

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:06.210 align:middle line:84%
and harnessed that in terms
of the way they led companies.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:07.680 align:middle line:90%
It's a new brand of leadership.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's absolutely
changing categories.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.510 align:middle line:84%
It's changing the quality of
life for millions of people.

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>It doesn't have
to be the greatest

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.290 align:middle line:84%
fear of their
board of directors.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>No, in fact their board
of directors are thrilled.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.650 align:middle line:84%
I talked to shareholders
from these companies.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.595 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't be happier
with the results.

00:13:25.595 --> 00:13:26.470 align:middle line:90%
So there you have it.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:31.547 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, let's talk about some
more specifics, such as how

00:13:31.547 --> 00:13:32.380 align:middle line:90%
about The Body Shop?

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.940 align:middle line:84%
This is a company most
everybody's familiar with.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>This is another
company that I got

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:40.610 align:middle line:84%
sort of criticized
for including.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:43.360 align:middle line:84%
The Body Shop is a
controversial company.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
they're controversial

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.880 align:middle line:84%
is that people criticize them
of not putting their money where

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.430 align:middle line:90%
their mouth is.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
they're criticized

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.540 align:middle line:84%
for not putting their
money where their mouth is

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.990 align:middle line:84%
is because when Anita
Roddick founded that company,

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:02.350 align:middle line:84%
she decided to make it a
model for corporate justice.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.050 align:middle line:84%
So what she did,
instead of just creating

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:09.420 align:middle line:84%
a company that behaves well, was
put pressure on other companies

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.149 align:middle line:90%
to behave well.

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And let me tell you, she made
a lot of enemies by doing that.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:17.050 align:middle line:84%
She would go into
Nigeria and protest

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:22.320 align:middle line:84%
the actions of oil and chemical
companies that were operating,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.685 align:middle line:84%
based on human rights and
environmental violations

00:14:25.685 --> 00:14:27.440 align:middle line:90%
and sins against humanity.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.750 align:middle line:84%
She really made those
violations known to the public

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:34.050 align:middle line:84%
at a time when people
weren't really watching

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.770 align:middle line:84%
what corporations were doing
in the third world countries

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:38.292 align:middle line:84%
and developing
nations they entered.

00:14:38.292 --> 00:14:39.500 align:middle line:90%
They weren't really watching.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.580 align:middle line:84%
These companies don't
have the obligation

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.527 align:middle line:84%
to report to shareholders
and the public

00:14:43.527 --> 00:14:45.110 align:middle line:84%
what they're doing
in these countries.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:47.775 align:middle line:90%
So she became very unpopular.

00:14:47.775 --> 00:14:50.070 align:middle line:84%
She made a lot of
friends in high places,

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.980 align:middle line:84%
but made a lot of
enemies in high places.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Since then, the company
had some difficulty,

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that it promised
to do a lot of things.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.470 align:middle line:84%
Then it went public,
and it had difficulty

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.500 align:middle line:84%
delivering on some
of those promises.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.940 align:middle line:84%
However, it succeeded in
delivering on many others.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I focused on what
they've succeeded in doing.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:18.270 align:middle line:84%
They've literally freed
prisoners of conscience.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:23.860 align:middle line:84%
They've helped several prisoners
escape death sentences.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.900 align:middle line:84%
These were prisoners that were
being held in developing areas

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:84%
for protesting against corporate
activities in those areas.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.890 align:middle line:90%
So it's incredible.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.920 align:middle line:84%
So they've done a great deal
for the human rights cause.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.040 align:middle line:84%
They've activated two
million people actually

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.120 align:middle line:84%
through a human rights
campaign they did.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.150 align:middle line:90%
And so it's incredible.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.730 align:middle line:90%
So they've had a huge reach.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.300 align:middle line:84%
They've also really changed
the law on animal testing

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.610 align:middle line:90%
in the UK.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:53.350 align:middle line:84%
They've also done a great
deal for women's rights.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:56.337 align:middle line:84%
They've also done a great deal
for a host of other issues.

00:15:56.337 --> 00:15:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Domestic violence
is something they're

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.940 align:middle line:90%
very focused on right now.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is a company that
has done tremendous things.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.820 align:middle line:84%
But those tremendous
things have been

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.850 align:middle line:90%
overshadowed by controversy.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:10.430 align:middle line:84%
So it was my objective
to go in and go, uhuh.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.590 align:middle line:84%
We're not hearing
the whole story.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:16.110 align:middle line:84%
What we hear is, oh, The Body
Shop, they're controversial.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:17.826 align:middle line:90%
Stay away from them.

00:16:17.826 --> 00:16:18.950 align:middle line:90%
They don't walk their talk.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually there's
evidence that they do.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.800 align:middle line:84%
There's a great deal of
evidence that they do.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to tell their
story, and I'm glad I did.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>>What was her original
mission statement?

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>>Her mission was to, I
think, just sort of turn

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.460 align:middle line:84%
the beauty industry on its
head is what she told me.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.950 align:middle line:84%
She just wanted to absolutely
be the antithesis of how

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:43.040 align:middle line:90%
other cosmetics giants operated.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.520 align:middle line:84%
She just thought,
this is ridiculous.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.820 align:middle line:90%
Women are being--

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean she just saw so
many flaws with the system.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think she's a
great classic example

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:56.890 align:middle line:84%
of an entrepreneur
who is socially minded

00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:01.920 align:middle line:84%
and decides to set up and
almost create a counterculture.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>Yet still recognizing
that the beauty industry

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.760 align:middle line:90%
is not going to go away.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.475 align:middle line:84%
We have these essential
human desires and needs,

00:17:08.475 --> 00:17:12.454 align:middle line:84%
and still in essence
playing to that.

00:17:12.454 --> 00:17:13.079 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:16.069 align:middle line:84%
And they've been
criticized for that too.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:middle line:84%
Some critics go, well, why are
you promoting female perfection

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.619 align:middle line:84%
and beauty and
physical perfection

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:23.470 align:middle line:90%
if you are actually so soulful?

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reality is that
beauty is an element of life,

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and it's an aesthetic that
most people appreciate

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and something that most
women want to feel.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And what is wrong with
catering to that need?

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Just like what is wrong with
BP delivering energy sources

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:42.210 align:middle line:90%
that people desire?

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:46.140 align:middle line:84%
What would people do if we
didn't have petroleum resources

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:46.810 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:48.850 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't be here
because you wouldn't

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:52.360 align:middle line:84%
have been able to get on
the plane or in your car.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Literally, there
would be no lights.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.770 align:middle line:90%
We would have major problems.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So our lives would be
drastically different.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.470 align:middle line:84%
So in every case and
with every industry,

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.900 align:middle line:84%
it is really about
gradual progress.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.290 align:middle line:90%
But it is about the progress.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:10.070 align:middle line:84%
The progress part
has to be emphasized

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.580 align:middle line:84%
because really
business has to change.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>And then, the
other corporations

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.520 align:middle line:84%
that might be teetering
need the inspiration.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.740 align:middle line:84%
They need to see
the success maybe

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:22.300 align:middle line:90%
by others who have led the way.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:27.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the reason I wrote this
book was to nudge fence-sitters

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:29.210 align:middle line:90%
and activate the converted.

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:32.210 align:middle line:84%
It was not to convert
the disbelievers.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.669 align:middle line:84%
My next book is
going to do that.

00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:35.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk
to people who don't

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:38.760 align:middle line:84%
believe in this whole thing
and prove, statistically,

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.250 align:middle line:90%
why it works.

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:43.300 align:middle line:84%
But this book was designed
to activate the converted.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.820 align:middle line:84%
So the people who already
believe, who think, I

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.830 align:middle line:84%
think that this is really
a worthwhile movement,

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:51.990 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not quite sure
what to do about it or how.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Or to nudge the fence-sitters,
who are kind of going, well,

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.630 align:middle line:84%
I think so, but
maybe not, I wanted

00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:84%
to push those
people into action.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.892 align:middle line:84%
And that's why,
frankly, I got to talk

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:04.350 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of these
corporate leaders

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.910 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted to
share their opinions,

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:08.040 align:middle line:90%
their strategies.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.150 align:middle line:84%
They gave me, in some
cases, their business plans,

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.910 align:middle line:84%
confidential,
strategic documents.

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And they enabled
me, they allowed

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.620 align:middle line:84%
me to print those
things because they

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.790 align:middle line:84%
want other companies to
follow in their footsteps.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>Let's talk about
Stonyfield Farms.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>I love that company.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.170 align:middle line:10%
It's my favorite yogurt.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:29.520 align:middle line:10%
Stonyfield Farms is a
terrific yogurt company.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.360 align:middle line:10%
And Gary Hirshberg, the
founder of that organization,

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.300 align:middle line:10%
is the most successful organic
entrepreneur in the world

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.960 align:middle line:10%
because that company was just,
well a couple of years ago,

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.040 align:middle line:10%
partly taken over
by Group Danone.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:10%
But the nature of the
deal that Hirshberg

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.470 align:middle line:10%
struck with Group
Danone enabled him

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:53.060 align:middle line:10%
to stick to his promise of
continuing to use only the best

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.320 align:middle line:10%
ingredients that
promote human health,

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.070 align:middle line:10%
to continue to help
struggling New England dairy

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.720 align:middle line:10%
farmers to survive,
and to pioneer

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.480 align:middle line:10%
environmental stewardship.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And he's stuck with that
after having been taken over

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.570 align:middle line:84%
by a major, publicly
traded company.

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:12.740 align:middle line:90%
That's a hard thing to do.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.580 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
companies I can show you

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.930 align:middle line:84%
where, after the
acquisition, it's

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:21.110 align:middle line:84%
really hard to continue to
deliver on these values.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:22.510 align:middle line:90%
But they've done it.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>>How long can that kind of
oversight last as a rule?

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, like I said, it
had to do with the deal

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.970 align:middle line:90%
that he struck.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:34.370 align:middle line:90%
So he made it a requirement.

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:37.226 align:middle line:84%
He said, you know, we
have to do it this way,

00:20:37.226 --> 00:20:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and we have to continue because
this is what we are about

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.890 align:middle line:84%
as a company, and we
cannot abandon our core.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I would
just turn this away.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.290 align:middle line:90%
I don't want your money.

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:47.940 align:middle line:90%
So that was a requirement.

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:84%
So they are contractually
obligated to let

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:54.760 align:middle line:84%
the company continue to
help versus harm society.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.010 align:middle line:90%
It's really amazing.

00:20:56.010 --> 00:21:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So Stonyfield will continue
to deliver the absolute best

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:03.310 align:middle line:84%
yogurt you can buy, the
absolute best ingredients that

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:05.950 align:middle line:84%
are healthier than
any ingredients

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:08.770 align:middle line:84%
that you can find in
any of the major brands.

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And Gary will
continue to campaign

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.410 align:middle line:84%
and to crusade and to
convince more consumers

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:14.960 align:middle line:90%
to vote at the checkout.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.290 align:middle line:90%
That's a very important thing.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>This brings up a
very large topic.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.370 align:middle line:84%
It's endemic to the natural food
industry now that companies--

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:27.940 align:middle line:90%
I won't name names.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.670 align:middle line:84%
This is not designed to
make anyone look bad.

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.315 align:middle line:90%
>>Let me name names.

00:21:33.315 --> 00:21:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>Large corporations
are taking over

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:40.430 align:middle line:84%
these beautiful little organic
and natural food companies.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>>I know.

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:42.460 align:middle line:90%
It happened to Odwalla.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>And for decades
literally to grow.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, it's
time for our payoff.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.915 align:middle line:84%
We have been working our
tails off for 20 years

00:21:50.915 --> 00:21:52.290 align:middle line:84%
to get this thing
up and running.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.520 align:middle line:84%
It's attracted the
money and attention.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And like you say,
the deal usually

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.320 align:middle line:90%
isn't structured in such a way.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.690 align:middle line:84%
So the consumer is often
duped into thinking

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:05.405 align:middle line:84%
that they are supporting
a natural food company,

00:22:05.405 --> 00:22:10.291 align:middle line:84%
when in fact it might be Disney
Corp. or M&M Mars bars or--

00:22:10.291 --> 00:22:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, there are
a couple of things

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:12.915 align:middle line:90%
that I have say about that.

00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:15.360 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I
think it's terrific

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.290 align:middle line:84%
that M&M Mars Corp.
or Disney owns

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:22.239 align:middle line:84%
a small, little, precious
company because that means

00:22:22.239 --> 00:22:23.780 align:middle line:84%
they're going in
the right direction.

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:25.613 align:middle line:84%
That means they're
investing in a trend that

00:22:25.613 --> 00:22:29.980 align:middle line:84%
is the most important business
trend, I think, in existence.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.260 align:middle line:84%
That is so positive
for this movement.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.950 align:middle line:84%
I hope that that
happens more often.

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Having said that,
it is very typical

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:40.650 align:middle line:84%
that when a company
is taken over,

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:42.910 align:middle line:90%
its senior staff is replaced.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.510 align:middle line:90%
It happened at Ben and Jerry's.

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:46.310 align:middle line:84%
It's happened to a
lot of companies.

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Ben and Jerry's was
taken over by Unilever,

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.260 align:middle line:90%
and Ben Cohen left.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.116 align:middle line:84%
And actually the
CEO was replaced.

00:22:53.116 --> 00:22:54.240 align:middle line:90%
So management was replaced.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.400 align:middle line:84%
So basically what happens
in an acquisition,

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.220 align:middle line:84%
and it's up to the
lawyers, and it's

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.870 align:middle line:84%
up to the owners of the company
to sort of grapple this out.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.340 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes,
you lose control.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
operations change.

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.780 align:middle line:90%
And that's a negative trend.

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:14.490 align:middle line:84%
See, because what these big
corporations don't realize

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:16.100 align:middle line:84%
is that the reason
the company is

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:20.590 align:middle line:84%
so valuable in the first place
and an attractive acquisition

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:23.220 align:middle line:84%
is not just because
of its brand identity.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Its brand identity is driven
by a business philosophy.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you change the
core, the brand image

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:32.780 align:middle line:90%
is gonna catch up.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to see
changes in the marketplace.

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.210 align:middle line:90%
And that's happened.

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:40.800 align:middle line:84%
It's happened with Ben
and Jerry's sort of.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.189 align:middle line:90%
They're doing extremely well.

00:23:42.189 --> 00:23:43.980 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, a lot of
people are going, gee,

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.021 align:middle line:90%
are they going to change?

00:23:45.021 --> 00:23:47.810 align:middle line:90%


00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:53.280 align:middle line:84%
How is Unilever going to
handle the social, the sort

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.130 align:middle line:84%
of soulful aspects
of the company?

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:56.640 align:middle line:90%
Will that go away?

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.242 align:middle line:84%
And so people are
still watching to see

00:23:59.242 --> 00:24:00.950 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen
with that company.

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:02.930 align:middle line:84%
I think it will be very
interesting to watch.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:04.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they've done
a reasonably good job.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.480 align:middle line:90%
I have to tip my hat to them.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And I also have to say that,
when a company like Starbucks,

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.370 align:middle line:90%
a different example.

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Even if Starbucks only offers 5%
of its total coffee assortment

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:22.120 align:middle line:84%
as fair trade, that
makes a huge impact

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.390 align:middle line:90%
because of Starbucks' power.

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:27.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's actually, I think
it's a positive trend, not

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:29.049 align:middle line:84%
a negative trend,
that big business is

00:24:29.049 --> 00:24:30.090 align:middle line:90%
getting involved in this.

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:33.090 align:middle line:84%
I hope more big businesses
get involved in this.

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>>Are you beginning to see
a shift in the philosophy

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.290 align:middle line:84%
where it's not, as
you said earlier, just

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:41.100 align:middle line:84%
to cash in on a
developed brand name,

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.450 align:middle line:84%
but really maybe a
new type of leadership

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:46.330 align:middle line:84%
emerging that's
looking to carry forth

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:50.290 align:middle line:84%
the original soul, the
intent of the company?

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, absolutely.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I think that more companies
are waking up to the fact

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000 align:middle line:84%
that this is more than just a
superficial image-based trend.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it's
criticized, and how

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:03.930 align:middle line:84%
it's characterized
by a lot of people.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:05.890 align:middle line:90%
That's not the case.

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Because what's going on is
in the system of capitalism

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.880 align:middle line:90%
there are two trends.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:15.670 align:middle line:84%
First, you have an
increased demand for--

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And people are
really watching out

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:19.360 align:middle line:84%
for errors of
corporate judgment.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.240 align:middle line:84%
It's becoming a lot harder
to get away with wrongdoing.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.570 align:middle line:90%
And people are demanding more.

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:26.400 align:middle line:84%
When I say people, I mean
shareholders, consumers,

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.090 align:middle line:84%
the press are demanding
more from companies in terms

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:33.550 align:middle line:84%
of integrity, transparency,
responsibility.

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:35.880 align:middle line:84%
They're demanding
a lot more today

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.090 align:middle line:90%
than they did 10 years ago.

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:38.310 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:40.150 align:middle line:84%
That's a demand in
the marketplace.

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:44.580 align:middle line:84%
So supply and demand,
companies have to address that.

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:49.995 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, you have
companies like Stonyfield, HP,

00:25:49.995 --> 00:25:52.570 align:middle line:84%
a huge slew of companies
that are putting

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.620 align:middle line:84%
their values into
action, that are behaving

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:59.410 align:middle line:84%
in an ethical way, that are
transforming their behavior

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:01.900 align:middle line:90%
and profiting from that.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:05.170 align:middle line:84%
They are outperforming their
competitors in the marketplace.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:07.530 align:middle line:84%
So put those two
trends together,

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:08.720 align:middle line:90%
and what does that say?

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.110 align:middle line:90%


00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:16.460 align:middle line:84%
This is not an image-based,
superficial movement.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.172 align:middle line:84%
I mean I really think
this trend has legs.

00:26:19.172 --> 00:26:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>>Tell us the story of HP.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.260 align:middle line:84%
You just brushed past
them a moment ago.

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:24.850 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, HP is interesting.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:27.510 align:middle line:84%
That is a company going through
some major transformation

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:29.210 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:33.060 align:middle line:84%
What people don't know is that
that's a company very heavily

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:37.110 align:middle line:84%
invested in what's
called microcapitalism.

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Microcapitalism is
about going into areas,

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.040 align:middle line:84%
well for HP it's about
going into developing

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.210 align:middle line:84%
areas of the world
and helping to raise

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:50.800 align:middle line:84%
the socioeconomic status of
the people who live there.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.770 align:middle line:84%
So what HP has
done is it's gone,

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:55.820 align:middle line:84%
we're going to help to
close the digital divide.

00:26:55.820 --> 00:27:00.470 align:middle line:84%
The digital divide really
separates the rich people

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:04.490 align:middle line:84%
in society, who have access to
all these great technologies,

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:09.610 align:middle line:84%
from poorer people, who have
no access to any technology.

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So that gap is getting
bigger and bigger

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:14.930 align:middle line:90%
as technology advances.

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:16.910 align:middle line:84%
So they have gone
into these areas,

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:19.910 align:middle line:84%
like Kuppam, India, South
Africa, South America,

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:20.990 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And they have
engineered technology

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:25.440 align:middle line:84%
that meets the needs
of the local people.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.890 align:middle line:84%
They've enabled those people
to join the global economy,

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:32.120 align:middle line:84%
to become entrepreneurs,
to raise themselves

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.240 align:middle line:90%
above the poverty line.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.739 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a charity
program, where

00:27:34.739 --> 00:27:36.060 align:middle line:90%
they are handing out money.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.930 align:middle line:84%
They're giving people the tools
to become self-sufficient.

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:42.940 align:middle line:84%
In doing that, they're
expanding their global presence.

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.650 align:middle line:90%
So that's an interesting case.

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:49.830 align:middle line:84%
It's an aspect of the company's
long term growth strategy.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:53.407 align:middle line:84%
>>The company, I always want
to say ebiza, but it's Eziba.

00:27:53.407 --> 00:27:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>>Eziba.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>I find this interesting.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:58.740 align:middle line:84%
I always look forward
to their little catalogs

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.510 align:middle line:84%
being plopped
through the mailbox.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about Eziba
because that seems

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.430 align:middle line:84%
to have a very high degree
of global connectivity to it.

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:07.590 align:middle line:90%
>>They absolutely do.

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:08.600 align:middle line:90%
I love that company.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.190 align:middle line:90%
They are so sweet and adorable.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:13.399 align:middle line:84%
And I love the founders,
Amber Chand and Dick Sabot,

00:28:13.399 --> 00:28:14.690 align:middle line:90%
who I was lucky enough to meet.

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>Let's talk about this
whole phenomenon of people

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:20.530 align:middle line:84%
shopping from catalogs at
home and perusing the world

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:21.600 align:middle line:90%
at their fingertips.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>They really brought cultures.

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:26.640 align:middle line:84%
What that company
does, first of all,

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.700 align:middle line:84%
is it markets, as
you said, products,

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.710 align:middle line:84%
artisan made products,
that are made

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.930 align:middle line:84%
by some of the poorest
people in the world.

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:42.270 align:middle line:84%
So you can get these wonderful
baskets made by Hindu people

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:46.790 align:middle line:84%
or people from different tribes
or people from remote areas

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:51.010 align:middle line:84%
that just don't have
the ability to sell

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:52.930 align:middle line:84%
their products to a
global marketplace.

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:57.220 align:middle line:84%
So they've created this
virtual global marketplace,

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:01.450 align:middle line:84%
as if you would go into bazaars
if you were in areas of Mexico,

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:05.090 align:middle line:84%
or any area in the world,
Africa, all over the place,

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:06.255 align:middle line:90%
they enable--

00:29:06.255 --> 00:29:07.796 align:middle line:84%
I'm completely
tripping over my words

00:29:07.796 --> 00:29:09.780 align:middle line:84%
right now so you
have to edit the--

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:16.560 align:middle line:84%
--they enable people to shop
from these global bazaars.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they've created
is this global marketplace

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.702 align:middle line:84%
for products made
by the hands of some

00:29:21.702 --> 00:29:23.160 align:middle line:84%
of the poorest
people in the world.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.257 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really
neat idea because they

00:29:26.257 --> 00:29:32.453 align:middle line:84%
are supporting ways of life
and preserving cultures really.

00:29:32.453 --> 00:29:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>How does the notion of
global community figure into--

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Is there a common
thread, I should

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.110 align:middle line:84%
say, with all these
businesses, that

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:42.440 align:middle line:84%
might run through the
notion of global community

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.480 align:middle line:84%
because everything,
certainly every corporation

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.330 align:middle line:90%
has to be looking for expansion.

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>They do.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And global community and
globalization, people

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:54.580 align:middle line:84%
may define those as two
very different things,

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.130 align:middle line:84%
but they're
connected, of course.

00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:02.110 align:middle line:84%
The more companies reach
people from all over the world

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:04.540 align:middle line:84%
and touch people from
all over the world,

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.720 align:middle line:84%
the more it's within
their best interest

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.805 align:middle line:84%
to help people from
all over the world.

00:30:09.805 --> 00:30:11.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's why those two
trends are connected.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.170 align:middle line:90%
It's really interesting.

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:16.760 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, Eziba
operates with the principle

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:20.120 align:middle line:84%
that talent is just as
abundant in the developing

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:23.150 align:middle line:84%
areas of the world as
it is in Silicon Valley.

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And all that's needed to
unleash that potential

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.100 align:middle line:90%
is the right environment.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.860 align:middle line:84%
So that company's
creating the environment,

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:33.360 align:middle line:84%
and people from
all over the world

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.190 align:middle line:84%
are benefiting from that
creation of that environment.

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:38.660 align:middle line:90%
So it's very interesting.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:42.527 align:middle line:84%
Companies need, at this
point, to think globally.

00:30:42.527 --> 00:30:43.360 align:middle line:90%
They have no choice.

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.630 align:middle line:84%
They're already doing
it in a business sense.

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:50.246 align:middle line:84%
But they're also realizing
that the more they harm society

00:30:50.246 --> 00:30:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and the environment
through their activities,

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.730 align:middle line:84%
the more in the long run
they risk harming themselves.

00:30:55.730 --> 00:31:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>So would you say that the
corporate world is really

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:03.500 align:middle line:84%
in a leading edge
position to show us

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:08.400 align:middle line:84%
how global community can be
developed in a healthy way?

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:10.950 align:middle line:90%
And you know what's so ironic?

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Is that the corporate
world is responsible for so

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.870 align:middle line:84%
many of the world's
problems and so much

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:22.200 align:middle line:84%
suffering that goes on
within these very areas.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's so ironic
that they happen

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.900 align:middle line:84%
to be the best positioned
entity to do something

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.550 align:middle line:84%
about that to stop
those problems.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:34.270 align:middle line:84%
I think that corporate America
has a better set of tools,

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:37.250 align:middle line:84%
the capabilities, the
power, the influence

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:39.370 align:middle line:84%
to solve some of
the worst social

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and environmental
problems that exist.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:44.370 align:middle line:84%
I think they're better poised
than any nonprofit group,

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:45.780 align:middle line:90%
any government entity.

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.530 align:middle line:84%
I think when you put the
power of corporate America

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:53.070 align:middle line:84%
behind some of those
trends or to work

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:55.410 align:middle line:84%
for some of those
problems rather you really

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:58.080 align:middle line:90%
see progress a lot faster.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>So, as consumers, what
is our part in seeing

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.789 align:middle line:84%
that this trend
is moved forward?

00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:10.950 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, and I'm
not a perfect consumer.

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:12.910 align:middle line:90%
I totally admit.

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:15.060 align:middle line:90%
We have to open our eyes.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:19.400 align:middle line:84%
We have to realize that
there's a high price that's

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.990 align:middle line:90%
paid for low cost goods.

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:25.730 align:middle line:84%
We have to realize that every
purchase we make actually

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:27.580 align:middle line:90%
does make a difference.

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And we also have to
understand that you

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:32.930 align:middle line:84%
don't have to radically reinvent
your life and become a hippie

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:36.750 align:middle line:84%
and not buy anything
in order to do well.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:40.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you made one
or two different choices.

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:42.810 align:middle line:84%
If you're shopping
for a car, get one

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:44.140 align:middle line:90%
with better gas mileage.

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:44.840 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.710 align:middle line:84%
OK, if it's between
two, pick the one

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:48.060 align:middle line:90%
that gets better gas mileage.

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:51.381 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't started
recycling, start to recycle.

00:32:51.381 --> 00:32:53.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can do little
things in your personal life

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:54.160 align:middle line:90%
that add up.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:58.240 align:middle line:84%
But we do have to be conscious
when we're in the grocery store

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:02.580 align:middle line:84%
and embrace brands that
are embracing this movement

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.210 align:middle line:84%
because that is the
missing element.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:10.830 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have consumers
aware and active,

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:12.002 align:middle line:90%
this won't go anywhere.

00:33:12.002 --> 00:33:12.960 align:middle line:90%
And it really needs to.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>So ultimately,
we have the power.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:15.850 align:middle line:90%
We hold the power.

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Even though people
feel powerless

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:18.980 align:middle line:84%
against the corporate
world at times--

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:19.764 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

00:33:19.764 --> 00:33:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>>--we still hold the power.

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>>That's a myth.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a myth that
the corporate world

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.890 align:middle line:84%
is the most powerful entity
on the face of the earth.

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:27.190 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:29.930 align:middle line:84%
The consumer is by
far because whatever

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:33.250 align:middle line:84%
we say we want they
have to give us.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:34.300 align:middle line:90%
They have to listen.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.460 align:middle line:90%
They have no choice.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:39.010 align:middle line:84%
They rely on us in
order to make money.

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:41.340 align:middle line:84%
So if enough of
us stand together

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:44.730 align:middle line:84%
and say, enough or we're
going to embrace this,

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:48.100 align:middle line:84%
they are gonna follow
like little puppies.

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:49.030 align:middle line:90%
That's the truth.

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:53.570 align:middle line:90%


00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>>Christine's book Cause
For Success is a must

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:59.100 align:middle line:84%
for any business person
looking to blend consciousness

00:33:59.100 --> 00:33:59.997 align:middle line:90%
with profits.

00:33:59.997 --> 00:34:02.080 align:middle line:84%
I think you'll find these
corporate stories deeply

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.010 align:middle line:90%
inspiring.

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:06.332 align:middle line:84%
Check it out at Christine's
website causeforsuccess.com.

00:34:06.332 --> 00:34:09.219 align:middle line:84%
By the way, Christine is
busily working on an expansive

00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:10.500 align:middle line:90%
follow up to this book.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.345 align:middle line:84%
We'll revisit the subject as
she nears her publishing date.

00:34:13.345 --> 00:34:16.304 align:middle line:84%
Until next time,
thanks for watching.
