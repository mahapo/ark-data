00:00:00.786 --> 00:00:02.368
<v ->Eric Pearl did not ask</v>

2
00:00:02.368 --> 00:00:04.126
to become an energy worker.

3
00:00:04.126 --> 00:00:06.126
Like many of the people we've interviewed

4
00:00:06.126 --> 00:00:08.406
his ability to heal through his hands

5
00:00:08.406 --> 00:00:10.106
came spontaneously,

6
00:00:10.106 --> 00:00:11.384
and carried some strange,

7
00:00:11.384 --> 00:00:13.802
and some surprising experiences with it.

8
00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:15.722
As his reputation spread,

9
00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:17.161
Eric was asked to teach

10
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:18.241
what he had learned.

11
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:20.799
Today he spends 40 weeks a year on the road

12
00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:23.489
teaching what he calls "The Reconnection."

13
00:00:33.857 --> 00:00:36.915
So, Eric, yours certainly was no

14
00:00:36.915 --> 00:00:39.211
average life, or childhood.

15
00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:42.013
In fact, when other kids wanted to be

16
00:00:42.013 --> 00:00:44.191
firemen and cowboys and Indians

17
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:45.849
you were playing,

18
00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:47.609
as I recall from your book,

19
00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:49.417
the Oracle of Delphi.

20
00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:52.813
<v ->All right, I wasn't playing the Oracle of Delphi.</v>

21
00:00:54.447 --> 00:00:55.823
I just sort of remember when

22
00:00:55.823 --> 00:00:56.963
I was sitting in school,

23
00:00:56.963 --> 00:00:59.271
and everyone else was having different...

24
00:01:00.203 --> 00:01:03.221
They were, you know, different imagery lifetimes.

25
00:01:03.221 --> 00:01:04.701
For some reason I thought it would be cool

26
00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:07.159
to be the Oracle of Delphi.

27
00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:08.395
The thing was

28
00:01:08.395 --> 00:01:10.691
I didn't know who

29
00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:12.507
the Oracle of Delphi was.

30
00:01:12.507 --> 00:01:14.287
It just sounded like a cool name,

31
00:01:14.287 --> 00:01:15.903
and for some reason

32
00:01:15.903 --> 00:01:18.823
I thought that this person lived in a cave,

33
00:01:18.823 --> 00:01:20.641
and lots of people would come.

34
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:22.959
I remember seeing it in long lines

35
00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:24.659
winding up towards this cave,

36
00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.563
but I had no idea what went on after that.

37
00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:28.533
<v Voiceover>So what was it in you</v>

38
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:30.573
that really was resonating with

39
00:01:30.573 --> 00:01:33.599
the whole notion of, say,

40
00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:36.789
knowledge beyond the ordinary?

41
00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:38.147
Was that a resonance for you

42
00:01:38.147 --> 00:01:39.925
on some level even as a kid?

43
00:01:39.925 --> 00:01:41.723
Were you digging a little bit deeper

44
00:01:41.723 --> 00:01:43.263
than some of the other kids?

45
00:01:43.263 --> 00:01:44.959
<v ->I guess on a child's level</v>

46
00:01:47.457 --> 00:01:49.437
I always asked questions.

47
00:01:49.437 --> 00:01:51.355
I always had questions,

48
00:01:51.355 --> 00:01:54.155
and, fortunately,

49
00:01:55.207 --> 00:01:57.303
I had parents who always

50
00:01:57.303 --> 00:01:59.023
answered my questions,

51
00:01:59.023 --> 00:02:02.791
and to me that's the only way to interact.

52
00:02:03.517 --> 00:02:05.401
Someone has a question.

53
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:07.157
You do your best to answer it,

54
00:02:07.157 --> 00:02:08.217
and to answer it directly,

55
00:02:08.217 --> 00:02:09.963
and answer it completely.

56
00:02:10.617 --> 00:02:12.853
It wasn't until I really got out in the world

57
00:02:12.853 --> 00:02:14.193
to find that a lot of people

58
00:02:14.193 --> 00:02:15.979
totally don't get it.

59
00:02:16.853 --> 00:02:19.637
I remember people saying to me sometimes,

60
00:02:19.637 --> 00:02:21.485
"You have so many questions,"

61
00:02:21.485 --> 00:02:23.485
or, "I don't see why you need

62
00:02:23.485 --> 00:02:26.259
"an answer to this, or an answer to that,"

63
00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:27.777
and I would say,

64
00:02:27.777 --> 00:02:29.421
even in a relationship I had.

65
00:02:30.353 --> 00:02:31.955
"You have all these questions.

66
00:02:31.955 --> 00:02:33.939
"I don't have to answer all of your questions."

67
00:02:34.515 --> 00:02:37.337
And I said, "Yes, actually, you do,

68
00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.293
"by virtue of the fact that I have a question

69
00:02:41.025 --> 00:02:43.371
"is sufficient reason to answer it."

70
00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.059
I know that to some people

71
00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:48.121
that sounds a little

72
00:02:48.891 --> 00:02:52.231
self-righteous, self-imposing, I don't know,

73
00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:55.225
but it really, truly feels that way to me

74
00:02:55.225 --> 00:02:56.870
that that's appropriate.

75
00:02:57.526 --> 00:02:58.661
I'm comfortable with it

76
00:02:58.661 --> 00:03:02.107
because I don't look at it as just from one side.

77
00:03:02.107 --> 00:03:03.946
It's not just by virtue of the fact

78
00:03:03.946 --> 00:03:05.487
that I have a question

79
00:03:05.487 --> 00:03:07.524
then it deserves to be answered.

80
00:03:08.082 --> 00:03:10.534
It's whoever has a question

81
00:03:10.534 --> 00:03:12.534
it deserves to be answered,

82
00:03:12.534 --> 00:03:13.606
and if the people that

83
00:03:13.606 --> 00:03:15.526
you're spending your time with

84
00:03:15.526 --> 00:03:18.976
don't recognize, or feel that

85
00:03:18.976 --> 00:03:21.440
they would go out of their way to honor

86
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.320
whatever type of question that you're asking,

87
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.680
I don't think we're necessarily

88
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.784
hanging with the appropriate supportive people.

89
00:03:27.656 --> 00:03:29.278
<v Voiceover>It's interesting because</v>

90
00:03:29.278 --> 00:03:31.098
we'll get to this a little bit later

91
00:03:31.098 --> 00:03:32.976
as we hopscotch through your life a bit,

92
00:03:32.976 --> 00:03:35.056
and you started doing the work you do now.

93
00:03:35.056 --> 00:03:36.794
At one point you started thinking,

94
00:03:36.794 --> 00:03:39.472
"Okay, I'm asking too many questions.

95
00:03:39.472 --> 00:03:41.372
"I'm not getting the answers I want,"

96
00:03:41.372 --> 00:03:43.372
but to get to that point

97
00:03:43.372 --> 00:03:45.332
you did have to continue asking

98
00:03:45.332 --> 00:03:46.912
an awful lot of questions,

99
00:03:46.912 --> 00:03:48.812
and as you grew up it sounds like you were

100
00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:50.472
not the world's best student

101
00:03:50.472 --> 00:03:52.090
because you were smart, but antsy,

102
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.468
and they weren't giving you what you wanted.

103
00:03:54.468 --> 00:03:55.750
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

104
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.688
<v Voiceover>When did you discover what</v>

105
00:03:56.688 --> 00:03:58.716
you were to become?

106
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.279
<v ->Just to backtrack on what you said.</v>

107
00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:07.988
I never felt I was asking too many questions.

108
00:04:09.758 --> 00:04:11.917
I recognized at a certain point

109
00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:14.297
that answers about certain questions

110
00:04:14.297 --> 00:04:16.197
were not going to be given to me

111
00:04:16.197 --> 00:04:18.296
in the way that I wanted to receive them.

112
00:04:18.296 --> 00:04:20.496
I was not a student.

113
00:04:20.496 --> 00:04:23.236
I was not what you would call a "student."

114
00:04:23.236 --> 00:04:25.214
I didn't open my books,

115
00:04:25.214 --> 00:04:26.574
didn't pay attention.

116
00:04:26.574 --> 00:04:28.654
My mother and father were always

117
00:04:28.654 --> 00:04:30.314
being brought into school

118
00:04:30.314 --> 00:04:31.734
"Eric got another blue slip."

119
00:04:31.734 --> 00:04:33.733
Blue slip means didn't do his homework.

120
00:04:33.733 --> 00:04:34.793
I didn't do my homework.

121
00:04:34.793 --> 00:04:36.173
I had a life, thank you very much,

122
00:04:36.173 --> 00:04:38.313
and school took enough away from my life,

123
00:04:38.313 --> 00:04:40.472
you know, everyday.

124
00:04:40.472 --> 00:04:42.492
The longest five minute period,

125
00:04:42.492 --> 00:04:44.952
I should say the longest three hour period

126
00:04:44.952 --> 00:04:47.029
I ever experienced were the five minutes

127
00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:49.189
between 2:55 and three o'clock everyday

128
00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:50.289
when school would let out.

129
00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.277
I mean it seemed like three hours right there.

130
00:04:53.288 --> 00:04:55.007
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

131
00:04:55.007 --> 00:04:56.876
I just knew I didn't want to be in school.

132
00:04:57.328 --> 00:04:58.906
I went through high school.

133
00:05:00.285 --> 00:05:01.825
I went to undergrad,

134
00:05:01.825 --> 00:05:02.883
went to the University of Miami

135
00:05:02.883 --> 00:05:05.323
for my first year in undergraduate school.

136
00:05:05.323 --> 00:05:06.583
My parents told me

137
00:05:06.583 --> 00:05:07.842
because they knew how much I hated school

138
00:05:07.842 --> 00:05:09.362
that I could take a year off,

139
00:05:09.362 --> 00:05:11.162
and I said "No," because I knew if I did

140
00:05:11.162 --> 00:05:13.182
I would never go back,

141
00:05:13.182 --> 00:05:14.921
so I went, I did my undergrad,

142
00:05:14.921 --> 00:05:16.301
started there for a year,

143
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:17.318
then I went to the Hebrew University

144
00:05:17.318 --> 00:05:18.578
in Jerusalem for a year.

145
00:05:18.578 --> 00:05:20.507
I went to Rutgers for two years.

146
00:05:21.318 --> 00:05:24.517
Liberal Arts, just whatever came along

147
00:05:24.517 --> 00:05:26.137
with no idea of what was happening,

148
00:05:26.137 --> 00:05:28.435
and, finally, after realizing

149
00:05:28.435 --> 00:05:30.830
I did not know what I wanted to do with my life,

150
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.210
I had experienced something called Rolfing

151
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.288
which is a very deep,

152
00:05:34.288 --> 00:05:35.646
muscle manipulative technique.

153
00:05:35.646 --> 00:05:38.102
It brings about physical changes in your body

154
00:05:38.102 --> 00:05:39.402
which also brings about

155
00:05:39.402 --> 00:05:40.882
mental and emotional changes

156
00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:42.182
because let's face it

157
00:05:42.182 --> 00:05:43.922
you can't feel like this,

158
00:05:43.922 --> 00:05:46.102
when you're spending your life like that.

159
00:05:46.102 --> 00:05:47.560
So I thought well this brought about

160
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.060
a lot of great changes for people,

161
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.040
and I sort of practiced what I picked up

162
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.040
from my own sessions,

163
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.320
and worked on other people,

164
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.200
and helped them.

165
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.438
I said, "Maybe I'll become a Rolfer,"

166
00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:57.980
which, of course, did not, shall we say,

167
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.577
excite Jewish parents.

168
00:06:00.577 --> 00:06:01.516
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

169
00:06:01.516 --> 00:06:02.876
It wasn't enough.

170
00:06:02.876 --> 00:06:04.384
It wasn't substantial enough.

171
00:06:04.384 --> 00:06:06.063
<v ->Right, and they said to me,</v>

172
00:06:06.063 --> 00:06:07.334
they weren't gonna stop me from

173
00:06:07.334 --> 00:06:08.185
doing what I wanted to do.

174
00:06:08.185 --> 00:06:09.444
They were probably thrilled I was willing

175
00:06:09.444 --> 00:06:10.950
to do anything at that point.

176
00:06:11.642 --> 00:06:14.740
They said, "Well, a friend of the family

177
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.698
"knows someone who's a chiropractor.

178
00:06:16.698 --> 00:06:18.878
"It's sort of similar in its approach.

179
00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.378
"Why don't you meet this chiropractor,

180
00:06:20.378 --> 00:06:22.238
"and talk about that,

181
00:06:22.238 --> 00:06:24.438
"and if you like it then you can get that as

182
00:06:24.438 --> 00:06:26.678
"a degree to fall back upon,

183
00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:28.024
"if Rolfing doesn't work,"

184
00:06:28.024 --> 00:06:29.504
which is about the most subtle

185
00:06:29.504 --> 00:06:31.398
they'd ever been with me.

186
00:06:31.398 --> 00:06:33.708
So I went to meet this doctor

187
00:06:33.708 --> 00:06:35.736
who showed me this ugly little nerve chart

188
00:06:35.736 --> 00:06:37.376
of the brain, and the spine, and the nerves,

189
00:06:37.376 --> 00:06:38.756
and where they all go to the organs,

190
00:06:38.756 --> 00:06:39.916
and he explained when sickness

191
00:06:39.916 --> 00:06:41.756
happens in the body

192
00:06:41.756 --> 00:06:43.296
it's often because there's

193
00:06:43.296 --> 00:06:45.176
a communication interference between

194
00:06:45.176 --> 00:06:47.876
the brain and those different organs in the body

195
00:06:47.876 --> 00:06:49.076
because the cells turn

196
00:06:49.076 --> 00:06:50.274
themselves over normally,

197
00:06:50.274 --> 00:06:51.834
and as long as the communication is happening

198
00:06:51.834 --> 00:06:54.214
that continues to cycle at a normal level.

199
00:06:54.214 --> 00:06:56.434
If it's not happening there's an interference.

200
00:06:56.434 --> 00:06:57.708
One of the bones is out of place,

201
00:06:57.708 --> 00:06:58.908
so remove it out of place,

202
00:06:58.908 --> 00:06:59.944
get it out of the way,

203
00:06:59.944 --> 00:07:00.922
allow the power that made

204
00:07:00.922 --> 00:07:02.242
the body to heal the body.

205
00:07:02.242 --> 00:07:04.020
I go, "That sounds cool, I'll do it."

206
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.458
So I applied to school,

207
00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:06.938
showed up in school.

208
00:07:06.938 --> 00:07:08.638
The first day we were in a class

209
00:07:08.638 --> 00:07:10.054
with about 86 people.

210
00:07:10.054 --> 00:07:11.334
I'm the last one in the back.

211
00:07:11.334 --> 00:07:12.754
They start with the first one in the front,

212
00:07:12.754 --> 00:07:14.032
and they say, "Why are you here?"

213
00:07:14.032 --> 00:07:14.932
The first one says,

214
00:07:14.932 --> 00:07:17.030
"Well, my father was able to walk again."

215
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.990
The second one had a return to the Olympics,

216
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.730
the third one was in a car accident,

217
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:22.642
and they thought he'd die,

218
00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:23.762
and he regained the use of

219
00:07:23.762 --> 00:07:24.802
his arms, and his brain,

220
00:07:24.802 --> 00:07:26.758
Everyone had some major healing story,

221
00:07:26.758 --> 00:07:28.590
or they had 47 chiropractors in their family,

222
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:29.874
one of the two.

223
00:07:29.874 --> 00:07:32.088
They get to me I'm the second last person.

224
00:07:32.088 --> 00:07:33.486
They said, "And why are you here?"

225
00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:36.264
And I went, "Well, it sounded good."

226
00:07:37.442 --> 00:07:38.642
<v Voiceover>A man with a purpose.</v>

227
00:07:38.642 --> 00:07:40.690
<v ->Because I hadn't even been to a chiropractor.</v>

228
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:42.822
So what was interesting is...

229
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:44.406
This is an interesting route

230
00:07:44.406 --> 00:07:46.350
to take in this conversation.

231
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.464
Because there really is

232
00:07:49.464 --> 00:07:52.378
nothing that happens

233
00:07:52.378 --> 00:07:55.438
that isn't a part of synchronicity.

234
00:07:55.438 --> 00:07:57.138
You just don't always get to notice it

235
00:07:57.138 --> 00:07:59.178
when it's occurring,

236
00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:02.254
so I loved the idea of removing the interference,

237
00:08:02.254 --> 00:08:03.370
getting it out of the way,

238
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.570
allowing the intelligence

239
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:06.746
of the body to heal itself sounded great.

240
00:08:06.746 --> 00:08:09.586
I go to school and they beat it out of you

241
00:08:09.586 --> 00:08:11.038
because they're trying to teach you

242
00:08:11.038 --> 00:08:14.492
how to be "pseudo" medical doctors,

243
00:08:14.492 --> 00:08:15.992
and practitioners,

244
00:08:15.992 --> 00:08:16.708
and you work on this,

245
00:08:16.708 --> 00:08:17.868
and you diagnose that,

246
00:08:17.868 --> 00:08:18.988
and you turn the other around,

247
00:08:18.988 --> 00:08:20.008
and then you need to study this,

248
00:08:20.008 --> 00:08:22.268
and you need to understand how that happens.

249
00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:24.398
By the time I got out of school...

250
00:08:25.446 --> 00:08:26.806
Well, in most chiropractic colleges

251
00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:28.126
there are three different things

252
00:08:28.126 --> 00:08:29.584
to become a chiropractor you need.

253
00:08:29.584 --> 00:08:30.420
You need to know what you need

254
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.360
to get through school successfully.

255
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.428
You need to know what you need to

256
00:08:33.428 --> 00:08:34.668
pass your board successfully,

257
00:08:34.668 --> 00:08:36.228
and you need to know what you need to know

258
00:08:36.228 --> 00:08:37.908
to become a successful doctor,

259
00:08:37.908 --> 00:08:40.000
and there's very little overlap in that.

260
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.756
So, anyway, I ended up going into practice

261
00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:45.436
doing standard, basic chiropractic

262
00:08:45.436 --> 00:08:46.650
adjusting the spine all over,

263
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:47.888
doing physical therapy,

264
00:08:47.888 --> 00:08:50.128
doing this, doing that, doing the other,

265
00:08:50.128 --> 00:08:53.234
all the things that most chiropractors do.

266
00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:56.644
In my ninth year in practice

267
00:08:56.644 --> 00:09:00.396
someone decided to take me to a seminar

268
00:09:00.396 --> 00:09:02.836
where there were some amazing speakers

269
00:09:02.836 --> 00:09:05.776
such as Jim Sigafoose, and a few others,

270
00:09:05.776 --> 00:09:08.072
on the universal laws,

271
00:09:08.072 --> 00:09:10.638
and principles of healing

272
00:09:11.492 --> 00:09:13.828
which is the philosophy of chiropractic

273
00:09:13.828 --> 00:09:15.068
which only about a third

274
00:09:15.068 --> 00:09:16.834
of the chiropractors actually know.

275
00:09:17.668 --> 00:09:18.864
You can usually tell whether you're going

276
00:09:18.864 --> 00:09:19.984
to a good chiropractor or not

277
00:09:19.984 --> 00:09:22.504
because if you see pain in their advertisements

278
00:09:22.504 --> 00:09:25.040
you're most likely in the wrong place.

279
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.156
Anyway, I thought,

280
00:09:27.156 --> 00:09:29.320
"Oh my God this is truth."

281
00:09:30.496 --> 00:09:34.750
I just heard truth

282
00:09:36.986 --> 00:09:39.408
which became a feeling.

283
00:09:39.408 --> 00:09:41.322
I mean I'm hearing that there's a resonance,

284
00:09:41.322 --> 00:09:43.074
there's a vibration.

285
00:09:43.702 --> 00:09:45.468
It was like I woke up.

286
00:09:45.468 --> 00:09:47.254
It was what I heard

287
00:09:48.186 --> 00:09:50.504
when I spoke to that first chiropractor

288
00:09:50.504 --> 00:09:53.416
before I applied to school what I lost,

289
00:09:53.416 --> 00:09:55.784
and what all of a sudden made sense.

290
00:09:58.034 --> 00:10:00.294
I went back to my practice.

291
00:10:00.294 --> 00:10:02.208
I changed the way I did things.

292
00:10:02.208 --> 00:10:04.748
I found a main interference somewhere,

293
00:10:04.748 --> 00:10:06.922
just one, instead of adjusting the whole spine.

294
00:10:06.922 --> 00:10:08.592
I removed the interference,

295
00:10:08.592 --> 00:10:09.582
got it out of the way,

296
00:10:09.582 --> 00:10:12.776
and I watched as the healings rose

297
00:10:13.706 --> 00:10:16.706
because healings have to do not just

298
00:10:16.706 --> 00:10:18.346
with what's physically being done,

299
00:10:18.346 --> 00:10:20.626
but with your consciousness,

300
00:10:20.626 --> 00:10:23.246
with your present moment awareness.

301
00:10:23.246 --> 00:10:25.266
In other words, I could have made

302
00:10:25.266 --> 00:10:27.182
the same physical movement

303
00:10:27.182 --> 00:10:29.902
a week earlier on someone,

304
00:10:29.902 --> 00:10:31.242
and the level of healing that

305
00:10:31.242 --> 00:10:32.602
they would have received

306
00:10:32.602 --> 00:10:34.762
would have not been anywhere near

307
00:10:34.762 --> 00:10:36.410
when I'd come back,

308
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.330
and I decided to wait, to pause,

309
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.650
to feel a connection with that person,

310
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:44.190
and then make that movement,

311
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.020
and somewhere

312
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.320
an equation forms that's different.

313
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.490
Instead of the mechanical chiropractor coming in,

314
00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.218
as person number one,

315
00:10:55.218 --> 00:10:57.378
person number two lying there on the table,

316
00:10:57.378 --> 00:10:58.358
moving the bone,

317
00:10:58.358 --> 00:11:00.058
and then that person functions a little better,

318
00:11:00.058 --> 00:11:02.010
and then chiropractor goes onto someone else.

319
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.910
Suddenly, instead of two,

320
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.256
it becomes the power of three.

321
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.006
You as the practitioner,

322
00:11:09.006 --> 00:11:10.706
the person on the table,

323
00:11:10.706 --> 00:11:12.118
and God, lover, universe.

324
00:11:12.118 --> 00:11:13.418
Pick the word you're happiest with.

325
00:11:13.418 --> 00:11:14.278
I like the God word.

326
00:11:14.278 --> 00:11:16.742
You want another one knock yourself out.

327
00:11:16.742 --> 00:11:18.922
The power of three coming together

328
00:11:18.922 --> 00:11:20.632
to create one brings us

329
00:11:20.632 --> 00:11:22.932
to an entirely new level of healing,

330
00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:24.352
so I discovered that in my

331
00:11:24.352 --> 00:11:26.532
ninth year of practice,

332
00:11:26.532 --> 00:11:28.692
and from that I went to the next level

333
00:11:28.692 --> 00:11:32.272
of some beautifully eclectic chiropractic,

334
00:11:32.272 --> 00:11:34.452
and chiropractic related healing techniques.

335
00:11:34.452 --> 00:11:36.410
One was called alphabiotics.

336
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:37.388
Virgil Chrane brought it out.

337
00:11:37.388 --> 00:11:39.338
Something called a bilateral occipital lift

338
00:11:39.338 --> 00:11:40.598
which synchronizes

339
00:11:40.598 --> 00:11:41.958
the right and left brain hemispheres,

340
00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.094
so suddenly you go from stress states

341
00:11:45.094 --> 00:11:47.350
into a central balance.

342
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.880
If feels, when you receive this,

343
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.600
it feels as if you've entered into

344
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.748
a state of stoned clarity.

345
00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.358
It's that gorgeous stoned state

346
00:11:57.358 --> 00:11:59.050
which, of course, none of us would ever know,

347
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.902
and yet, simultaneously,

348
00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.760
you're stoned clear.

349
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.048
I watched as people's lives would change.

350
00:12:06.048 --> 00:12:07.328
They would come back in and say:

351
00:12:07.328 --> 00:12:09.408
"Gee, everyone at the office has become

352
00:12:09.408 --> 00:12:10.902
"so much more friendly."

353
00:12:10.902 --> 00:12:13.222
They didn't realize that they had changed,

354
00:12:13.222 --> 00:12:14.622
so they were attracting changes in,

355
00:12:14.622 --> 00:12:16.900
and I watched as this happened,

356
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.278
but other things were going on

357
00:12:18.278 --> 00:12:19.516
in my life at the time.

358
00:12:19.516 --> 00:12:21.596
<v Voiceover>That's what I'd like to find out about</v>

359
00:12:21.596 --> 00:12:22.936
because you had some pretty

360
00:12:22.936 --> 00:12:25.396
extraordinary events occurring

361
00:12:25.396 --> 00:12:27.504
as a subplot to all of this.

362
00:12:28.196 --> 00:12:30.094
Among them you started feeling

363
00:12:30.094 --> 00:12:31.494
the presence of other beings.

364
00:12:31.494 --> 00:12:32.694
You were sure you were seeing them

365
00:12:32.694 --> 00:12:34.134
around the corner,

366
00:12:34.134 --> 00:12:35.994
or out of the corner of your eyes,

367
00:12:35.994 --> 00:12:38.634
and that led you to a path of discovery,

368
00:12:38.634 --> 00:12:40.312
as I understand,

369
00:12:40.312 --> 00:12:42.268
in addition to coming in contact with

370
00:12:42.268 --> 00:12:44.128
a whole array of different kinds of

371
00:12:44.128 --> 00:12:46.664
seers, sayers, and healers in Los Angeles,

372
00:12:46.664 --> 00:12:48.344
most of which you didn't put any stock in,

373
00:12:48.344 --> 00:12:50.244
but some things started changing.

374
00:12:50.244 --> 00:12:50.960
Do you want to talk about

375
00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.940
a couple of those events?

376
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.580
<v ->Sure, as you used the term subplots,</v>

377
00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.644
I mean I always had multiple subplots

378
00:12:57.644 --> 00:12:58.996
coming in all around my life.

379
00:12:58.996 --> 00:13:01.954
First of all, one thing I knew was that

380
00:13:04.072 --> 00:13:06.736
people come in, or continue to come in

381
00:13:06.736 --> 00:13:08.044
to see their doctor

382
00:13:08.044 --> 00:13:09.216
depending on whether or not

383
00:13:09.216 --> 00:13:10.808
they like the person at the front desk.

384
00:13:10.808 --> 00:13:12.248
Believe it or not,

385
00:13:12.248 --> 00:13:13.204
that's almost more important

386
00:13:13.204 --> 00:13:14.423
than the quality of your doctor.

387
00:13:14.423 --> 00:13:15.460
You're turned on, or you're turned off

388
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.560
by who answers the phone,

389
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.096
and who greets you.

390
00:13:18.096 --> 00:13:21.104
I always hired colorful personalities

391
00:13:21.104 --> 00:13:22.714
for my front desk.

392
00:13:24.844 --> 00:13:26.124
There was a little bit of turmoil,

393
00:13:26.124 --> 00:13:27.504
and the relationship that I thought

394
00:13:27.504 --> 00:13:29.204
was going to be my lifetime relationship

395
00:13:29.204 --> 00:13:30.928
came to a sudden end.

396
00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:34.758
I had trouble physically putting

397
00:13:34.758 --> 00:13:36.078
one foot in front of the other.

398
00:13:36.078 --> 00:13:36.958
Not an expression.

399
00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.313
I had trouble lifting a foot up,

400
00:13:38.313 --> 00:13:39.534
and putting it down

401
00:13:39.534 --> 00:13:41.454
going from table to table to see my patients

402
00:13:41.454 --> 00:13:44.154
because of the emotional upset

403
00:13:44.154 --> 00:13:45.673
around that situation,

404
00:13:45.673 --> 00:13:47.554
and there were some difficulties

405
00:13:47.554 --> 00:13:51.352
brewing with my colorful interaction of staff.

406
00:13:51.352 --> 00:13:52.732
I could collect colorful people,

407
00:13:52.732 --> 00:13:55.708
but in the blend it was often interesting.

408
00:13:55.708 --> 00:13:58.364
So I wasn't in any frame to do

409
00:13:58.364 --> 00:14:00.844
a really good smoothing out process

410
00:14:00.844 --> 00:14:01.944
so I did what you're told

411
00:14:01.944 --> 00:14:02.922
you're supposed to do in

412
00:14:02.922 --> 00:14:04.382
practice management seminars,

413
00:14:04.382 --> 00:14:06.335
but trust me, you haven't lived

414
00:14:06.335 --> 00:14:07.894
until you've done this one.

415
00:14:07.894 --> 00:14:08.774
<v Voiceover>What was it?</v>

416
00:14:08.774 --> 00:14:10.562
<v ->I let everyone go at once,</v>

417
00:14:11.833 --> 00:14:12.992
so I was answering the phone,

418
00:14:12.992 --> 00:14:14.352
I was adjusting the patients,

419
00:14:14.352 --> 00:14:16.330
filling out the forms,

420
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.730
doing the scheduling,

421
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.510
stamping the envelopes,

422
00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:21.590
chasing the postman.

423
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.909
This lasted for about an hour.

424
00:14:23.909 --> 00:14:25.349
I finally had someone come in,

425
00:14:25.349 --> 00:14:26.929
and help me hire a new group of people,

426
00:14:26.929 --> 00:14:29.324
and in came, of course, following my suit,

427
00:14:29.324 --> 00:14:31.064
this one person I wanted at the front desk

428
00:14:31.064 --> 00:14:33.344
who was both the physical and audible incarnation

429
00:14:33.344 --> 00:14:35.213
of Fran Drescher's "The Nanny."

430
00:14:35.213 --> 00:14:36.733
<v Voiceover>Oh God.</v>

431
00:14:36.733 --> 00:14:38.351
<v ->So, you know, it was a love/hate relationship.</v>

432
00:14:38.351 --> 00:14:39.771
I loved her, the patients hated her.

433
00:14:39.771 --> 00:14:41.011
She was doing little things

434
00:14:41.011 --> 00:14:42.371
I didn't realize at the time such as

435
00:14:42.371 --> 00:14:44.199
borrowing money from them,

436
00:14:45.149 --> 00:14:47.828
but, anyway, you know, one day in her craziness

437
00:14:47.828 --> 00:14:49.560
she said to me,

438
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.980
"You've been under so much stress lately,

439
00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:51.960
"you need to take a day off,

440
00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:52.740
"and go to the beach,"

441
00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.536
which really meant her.

442
00:14:54.536 --> 00:14:55.416
She wanted a day off,

443
00:14:55.416 --> 00:14:56.176
and wanted to go to the beach,

444
00:14:56.176 --> 00:14:56.752
and didn't want to spend

445
00:14:56.752 --> 00:14:58.892
her money on gasoline,

446
00:14:58.892 --> 00:15:01.072
but we went, and while I was there,

447
00:15:01.072 --> 00:15:02.792
she wandered off, came back, and said,

448
00:15:02.792 --> 00:15:04.854
"There's this woman I found reading cards.

449
00:15:05.928 --> 00:15:07.644
"You need to get your cards read by her."

450
00:15:07.644 --> 00:15:09.124
And I'm thinking, "I don't really mind

451
00:15:09.124 --> 00:15:10.840
"having my cards read,

452
00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.860
"but I'd like to go to someone

453
00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:12.960
"who comes with a good solid

454
00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.880
"referral or recommendation,

455
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:15.800
"not someone on a beach

456
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.400
"with folding chairs and a card table,"

457
00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.236
but she pushed and pushed,

458
00:15:18.236 --> 00:15:20.072
and I finally went over,

459
00:15:20.072 --> 00:15:22.572
and the women offered me a reading,

460
00:15:22.572 --> 00:15:23.852
and I let her give me the reading.

461
00:15:23.852 --> 00:15:25.892
It was nothing at all memorable.

462
00:15:25.892 --> 00:15:28.272
Nothing that stands out in my mind

463
00:15:28.272 --> 00:15:31.012
except she started saying to me,

464
00:15:31.012 --> 00:15:32.512
"Being a healer," which I thought she meant

465
00:15:32.512 --> 00:15:34.172
being a chiropractor,

466
00:15:34.172 --> 00:15:35.792
"There's this work that I do

467
00:15:35.792 --> 00:15:37.412
"that you need done."

468
00:15:37.412 --> 00:15:39.952
And so I listened as she explained that

469
00:15:39.952 --> 00:15:41.578
there's a system.

470
00:15:42.032 --> 00:15:43.688
Well, she started to talk about

471
00:15:43.688 --> 00:15:45.388
the meridian lines in our body,

472
00:15:45.388 --> 00:15:46.180
and explained they could be

473
00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.020
much more effective than they are now,

474
00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:48.808
when they used to be,

475
00:15:48.808 --> 00:15:50.048
because they used to be attached to

476
00:15:50.048 --> 00:15:51.788
the ley lines that encircle the planet,

477
00:15:51.788 --> 00:15:53.596
and continue out to the other stars and planets,

478
00:15:53.596 --> 00:15:54.772
and we at a certain point

479
00:15:54.772 --> 00:15:57.432
became disconnected from this system.

480
00:15:57.432 --> 00:15:58.752
She explained that she could do

481
00:15:58.752 --> 00:16:01.252
a certain work that would bring us back

482
00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:02.612
into that system.

483
00:16:02.612 --> 00:16:05.112
We could either slowly evolve into it over time,

484
00:16:05.112 --> 00:16:07.434
or she could do this fast-track work.

485
00:16:08.712 --> 00:16:11.282
So I listened to her, and I finally decided

486
00:16:11.282 --> 00:16:13.562
to let her do that little bit of work with me,

487
00:16:13.562 --> 00:16:15.822
and I did, and I didn't experience anything

488
00:16:15.822 --> 00:16:17.482
that I was aware of at the time.

489
00:16:17.482 --> 00:16:18.922
I went home, I went to sleep,

490
00:16:18.922 --> 00:16:21.300
and an hour later this lamp by my bed

491
00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.460
turned itself on.

492
00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.162
Now I had had this lamp for a good 10 years,

493
00:16:25.162 --> 00:16:26.778
and it hadn't selected any other occasion

494
00:16:26.778 --> 00:16:30.460
to self-ignite, but just the same, there it was.

495
00:16:31.818 --> 00:16:34.230
At the same time while I'm trying to figure out

496
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:36.490
how the lamp turned itself on

497
00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.970
I became acutely aware that there was

498
00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.510
one or more than one person in my home.

499
00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.310
I'm not the type of person who imagines

500
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.770
spirits, or entities, or beings,

501
00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:48.630
and so I didn't even think on that level.

502
00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.270
I thought there was someone,

503
00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.486
you know, someone in my house,

504
00:16:52.486 --> 00:16:54.386
so I got up very bravely with a knife,

505
00:16:54.386 --> 00:16:55.486
a can of pepper spray,

506
00:16:55.486 --> 00:16:57.746
and my Doberman Pinscher,

507
00:16:57.746 --> 00:16:59.342
and went looking,

508
00:16:59.342 --> 00:17:00.438
and after about 20 minutes

509
00:17:00.438 --> 00:17:02.098
I realized several things.

510
00:17:02.098 --> 00:17:04.418
There was someone there,

511
00:17:04.418 --> 00:17:05.754
yet, I could look all night,

512
00:17:05.754 --> 00:17:06.854
and I'd never find them,

513
00:17:06.854 --> 00:17:07.774
and if I didn't get some sleep

514
00:17:07.774 --> 00:17:10.184
I'd be a wreck for my patients the next day,

515
00:17:10.184 --> 00:17:12.176
so don't ask me why I decided

516
00:17:12.176 --> 00:17:13.496
to go back to sleep in my own bed.

517
00:17:13.496 --> 00:17:14.794
You'd think I'd at least go to a neighbors.

518
00:17:14.794 --> 00:17:16.754
I went back to sleep.

519
00:17:16.754 --> 00:17:19.874
Everything seemed normal after that.

520
00:17:19.874 --> 00:17:21.774
I went into work after the weekend.

521
00:17:22.544 --> 00:17:24.610
This is my 12th year in practice.

522
00:17:25.364 --> 00:17:26.836
No one had ever said this to me before,

523
00:17:26.836 --> 00:17:28.596
and on this one day seven different people

524
00:17:28.596 --> 00:17:31.908
insist that after their adjustment

525
00:17:31.908 --> 00:17:33.508
when I'd have them close their eyes,

526
00:17:33.508 --> 00:17:35.080
and rest for a minute

527
00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.360
that they felt someone walk into the room,

528
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.140
stand there, walk around, and run around,

529
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.076
and two of them actually looked me

530
00:17:40.076 --> 00:17:40.896
straight in the eye, and said,

531
00:17:40.896 --> 00:17:42.072
"It felt as if someone was flying

532
00:17:42.072 --> 00:17:43.572
"around the ceiling."

533
00:17:43.572 --> 00:17:44.470
No one in 12 years

534
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:45.910
had ever said that to me before.

535
00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:47.450
Other patients are saying,

536
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.338
"I can feel your hands before you touch me."

537
00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:52.068
I'm going, "Oh yeah, sure you can,

538
00:17:52.068 --> 00:17:54.448
"close your eyes," so they'd close their eyes,

539
00:17:54.448 --> 00:17:55.778
and I'd hold my hand over here,

540
00:17:55.778 --> 00:17:57.336
and they'd say, "Left shoulder, or right ankle,"

541
00:17:57.336 --> 00:17:58.756
so it became a game

542
00:17:58.756 --> 00:18:00.356
because it was my office,

543
00:18:00.356 --> 00:18:02.690
and I could have whatever games that I wanted.

544
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:03.890
As this was happening

545
00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.618
people started reporting

546
00:18:07.568 --> 00:18:09.508
long-term aches and pains

547
00:18:09.508 --> 00:18:10.788
simply vanishing from

548
00:18:10.788 --> 00:18:12.636
that little play that we did.

549
00:18:15.366 --> 00:18:17.126
Others were coming in showing me

550
00:18:17.126 --> 00:18:18.186
medical records saying,

551
00:18:18.186 --> 00:18:19.464
"Look, this tumor is gone,"

552
00:18:19.464 --> 00:18:23.064
or "I regained my color vision

553
00:18:23.064 --> 00:18:25.584
"which was lost because of the diabetes."

554
00:18:25.584 --> 00:18:27.544
So many things were happening,

555
00:18:27.544 --> 00:18:30.124
and saying, "What did you do?"

556
00:18:30.124 --> 00:18:31.840
And I said, "Nothing, and don't tell anyone."

557
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.440
Of course, that went over about as big as

558
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.898
Nancy Reagan just trying to say no,

559
00:18:35.898 --> 00:18:37.698
and people started coming in from everywhere

560
00:18:37.698 --> 00:18:39.176
saying, "I'll have what she had,"

561
00:18:39.176 --> 00:18:41.647
and my people are getting up out of wheelchairs,

562
00:18:41.647 --> 00:18:44.385
not all of them, but some of them.

563
00:18:44.385 --> 00:18:46.956
Enough that it started to bring

564
00:18:46.956 --> 00:18:50.042
attention, notoriety to what was happening.

565
00:18:51.314 --> 00:18:53.020
As word got out

566
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.848
people would say to me, "Teach this."

567
00:18:56.848 --> 00:18:58.768
And I'm going, "Teach it?"

568
00:18:58.768 --> 00:19:00.852
How the heck can you teach it?

569
00:19:01.542 --> 00:19:02.862
No one left me a manual.

570
00:19:02.862 --> 00:19:04.382
I was still trying to understand what it was

571
00:19:04.382 --> 00:19:06.242
because I spoke to that woman

572
00:19:06.242 --> 00:19:07.802
who did that work on me, you know,

573
00:19:07.802 --> 00:19:08.942
because the initial instinct is,

574
00:19:08.942 --> 00:19:11.022
"Oh, well, let's have her do some work on us."

575
00:19:11.022 --> 00:19:12.280
No one ever responded that way

576
00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.420
before or after.

577
00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.400
I spoke to the person who taught her that work,

578
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.122
who supposedly channeled it in, or created it.

579
00:19:20.014 --> 00:19:22.232
Pretty much the consensus was

580
00:19:22.232 --> 00:19:24.872
that that channeling work was a key,

581
00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:26.812
that all the people that that person

582
00:19:26.812 --> 00:19:28.370
taught how to do that work was like

583
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.530
making duplicates of keys,

584
00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:31.930
giving them out to people, and saying,

585
00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:33.350
"Keep trying locks.

586
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.450
"Try the door locks, try the door locks.

587
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:37.630
"Somewhere there's one door

588
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.550
"that's supposed to open."

589
00:19:41.049 --> 00:19:43.329
I guess that lock was in me.

590
00:19:43.329 --> 00:19:45.169
I was the door, I'm not the gift.

591
00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:47.369
The gift is what came through,

592
00:19:47.369 --> 00:19:48.769
but I guess that was it,

593
00:19:48.769 --> 00:19:49.629
so, as a matter of fact,

594
00:19:49.629 --> 00:19:50.549
the woman came back to me

595
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:52.217
to experience this work.

596
00:19:52.948 --> 00:19:55.087
I don't know how you could teach it,

597
00:19:55.087 --> 00:19:56.487
and I said there was no way,

598
00:19:56.487 --> 00:19:59.325
but the patients who had come in to see me

599
00:19:59.325 --> 00:20:00.325
would call and say,

600
00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:01.704
"Well, I just walked into the house

601
00:20:01.704 --> 00:20:02.983
"after my session with you,

602
00:20:02.983 --> 00:20:04.703
"and my lamp, or computer, or television,

603
00:20:04.703 --> 00:20:06.639
"stereo started to turn itself on,

604
00:20:06.639 --> 00:20:09.539
"and then off, and then on, and then off,"

605
00:20:09.539 --> 00:20:11.638
which was actually what my lamp had been doing.

606
00:20:11.638 --> 00:20:14.078
Not on/off, on/off, not flickering.

607
00:20:14.078 --> 00:20:16.118
I mean on for 20 minutes,

608
00:20:16.118 --> 00:20:18.018
then off for 15 or 20,

609
00:20:18.018 --> 00:20:19.674
then suddenly on for 15 or 20,

610
00:20:19.674 --> 00:20:21.434
again, in this pattern.

611
00:20:21.434 --> 00:20:23.074
They felt sensations near their hands.

612
00:20:23.074 --> 00:20:24.628
They'd hold their hands by someone in the family.

613
00:20:24.628 --> 00:20:26.928
The uncle who had the stroke could walk again.

614
00:20:26.928 --> 00:20:28.448
The grandmother regained her speech

615
00:20:28.448 --> 00:20:30.368
after, you know, whatever,

616
00:20:30.368 --> 00:20:32.528
all these little healings started happening,

617
00:20:32.528 --> 00:20:35.048
and we realized that somehow or other

618
00:20:35.048 --> 00:20:37.176
once you interact with this,

619
00:20:37.948 --> 00:20:39.966
and you do have to interact with it,

620
00:20:39.966 --> 00:20:41.542
once you interact with this,

621
00:20:41.542 --> 00:20:44.842
you can begin to carry this work.

622
00:20:44.842 --> 00:20:47.334
It's as if those of us

623
00:20:47.334 --> 00:20:49.320
on the planet right now

624
00:20:50.494 --> 00:20:53.070
the universal clock said,

625
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:55.670
approximately at this time,

626
00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.876
this gift will now be made,

627
00:20:58.986 --> 00:21:00.766
will now be offered to people here,

628
00:21:00.766 --> 00:21:03.376
and they need to be able to receive it.

629
00:21:05.386 --> 00:21:07.020
You know there's a lot of

630
00:21:07.982 --> 00:21:11.058
what I call so, like s-o spiritual one-upmanship.

631
00:21:11.058 --> 00:21:13.430
There's a lot of ego in a lot of different ways,

632
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:15.122
and you will hear certain people go,

633
00:21:15.122 --> 00:21:17.082
"Oh, I was reconnected in a dream,"

634
00:21:17.082 --> 00:21:18.586
or "I owned it,"

635
00:21:18.586 --> 00:21:20.546
and it really doesn't work that way.

636
00:21:20.546 --> 00:21:23.262
You do have to somehow interact with it.

637
00:21:23.262 --> 00:21:25.242
Even in this space of our interview

638
00:21:25.242 --> 00:21:27.662
it's in the room, and you're interacting with it,

639
00:21:27.662 --> 00:21:29.102
and then you begin to carry it.

640
00:21:29.102 --> 00:21:31.694
The teaching is how to utilize it.

641
00:21:31.694 --> 00:21:33.754
In other words, you can instantly gift

642
00:21:33.754 --> 00:21:36.954
an eating utensil to a toddler in a high chair,

643
00:21:36.954 --> 00:21:38.074
but you do spend a little time

644
00:21:38.074 --> 00:21:40.134
teaching them that it's not a drumstick,

645
00:21:40.134 --> 00:21:41.518
and it's not a slingshot,

646
00:21:41.518 --> 00:21:43.308
just a little time in that.

647
00:21:47.114 --> 00:21:48.614
I began by agreeing to take

648
00:21:48.614 --> 00:21:50.454
a group of 25 people,

649
00:21:50.454 --> 00:21:51.614
give them the history of it,

650
00:21:51.614 --> 00:21:53.154
allow them to feel it,

651
00:21:53.154 --> 00:21:55.154
show them how to work with it for a little bit,

652
00:21:55.154 --> 00:21:57.194
which I did, and then I released them out

653
00:21:57.194 --> 00:21:59.350
onto an unsuspecting planet,

654
00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:00.970
and the next thing I know is

655
00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:02.410
we're getting calls from all over

656
00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:03.790
to teach this work.

657
00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.530
It seems that it doesn't matter

658
00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:07.570
at what level you are

659
00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:09.610
when you come into contact with this work

660
00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:12.026
whether you're

661
00:22:12.026 --> 00:22:14.026
a Reiki Three Master,

662
00:22:14.026 --> 00:22:16.606
whether you're in your first level of Shingon,

663
00:22:16.606 --> 00:22:17.986
whether you're a grand master in Shingon,

664
00:22:17.986 --> 00:22:19.606
whether you haven't studied anything.

665
00:22:19.606 --> 00:22:21.266
Once you begin to carry this

666
00:22:21.266 --> 00:22:24.706
everyone moves to this new level with it,

667
00:22:24.706 --> 00:22:27.706
everyone changes, no matter where we are.

668
00:22:27.706 --> 00:22:31.506
It's as if none of our previous background

669
00:22:31.506 --> 00:22:33.326
makes us any better at it.

670
00:22:33.326 --> 00:22:36.046
It just simply changes

671
00:22:36.046 --> 00:22:38.158
the hues in our color, in our perspective

672
00:22:38.158 --> 00:22:40.678
in what we bring into this.

673
00:22:40.678 --> 00:22:43.618
The researchers pretty much

674
00:22:43.618 --> 00:22:46.278
were the first people that said to me

675
00:22:46.278 --> 00:22:49.476
that the reconnective healing

676
00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:52.886
frequency, bandwidth, something like that,

677
00:22:52.886 --> 00:22:55.446
seems to be new here on the planet,

678
00:22:55.446 --> 00:22:57.162
here for the very first time, and I'm thinking,

679
00:22:57.162 --> 00:22:59.542
"How the heck can you say something like that

680
00:22:59.542 --> 00:23:02.518
"especially from a research background?"

681
00:23:02.518 --> 00:23:04.174
And they said, "You really have to only

682
00:23:04.174 --> 00:23:06.280
"understand two basic concepts."

683
00:23:07.354 --> 00:23:09.490
One is, we were all raised being told

684
00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.218
we were three-dimensional beings.

685
00:23:11.878 --> 00:23:13.776
In the year 2000

686
00:23:14.474 --> 00:23:15.734
science formally announced

687
00:23:15.734 --> 00:23:16.778
that we were four-dimensional.

688
00:23:16.778 --> 00:23:18.728
No, we didn't grow a new dimension,

689
00:23:18.728 --> 00:23:20.628
and this really isn't a new idea,

690
00:23:20.628 --> 00:23:23.356
it's just that we weren't taught this.

691
00:23:24.548 --> 00:23:26.386
The fourth dimension is time.

692
00:23:26.386 --> 00:23:28.042
We're height, width, depth, and time.

693
00:23:28.042 --> 00:23:29.242
Einstein had been saying it

694
00:23:29.242 --> 00:23:31.522
since the early part of the last century.

695
00:23:31.522 --> 00:23:32.742
You know how progress moves forward

696
00:23:32.742 --> 00:23:34.722
one funeral at a time, sometimes,

697
00:23:34.722 --> 00:23:36.380
and it took enough people to die,

698
00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.100
and enough new people to come in

699
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.560
until pretty much in the year 2000.

700
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.700
1999 they said we were 3D Plus.

701
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.100
2000, formally, we are four-dimensional.

702
00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.540
We're height, width, depth, and time.

703
00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:48.260
We could see height, we could see width.

704
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.200
We could see depth,

705
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.738
but we couldn't see time,

706
00:23:51.738 --> 00:23:53.818
so it was very difficult for people

707
00:23:53.818 --> 00:23:56.278
to understand and accept.

708
00:23:56.278 --> 00:23:59.036
It sort of would be as if you were 200 years ago,

709
00:23:59.036 --> 00:24:00.074
and someone came in running into

710
00:24:00.074 --> 00:24:03.112
the scientific and maybe art community,

711
00:24:03.112 --> 00:24:05.064
and says, "Hey, guess what, I found these

712
00:24:05.064 --> 00:24:06.040
"two new nifty new colors.

713
00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.680
"I think I'll call them ultraviolet and infrared,"

714
00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.400
and everyone would say,

715
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.300
"Well, that's ridiculous

716
00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.200
"because we can't see them.

717
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.580
"If it's a color you can see it,

718
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:14.860
"so it doesn't exist."

719
00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.240
Of course, it does exist.

720
00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.878
We often have to wait for science

721
00:24:17.878 --> 00:24:19.754
to catch up with the ability

722
00:24:19.754 --> 00:24:22.004
to detect that which is,

723
00:24:22.778 --> 00:24:24.922
and so as that happened.

724
00:24:25.612 --> 00:24:26.610
Go ahead, where do you want to go?

725
00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:27.750
<v Voiceover>Well, I was just thinking</v>

726
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:28.810
as this was happening,

727
00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:30.730
and you were still not even clear yourself

728
00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:33.370
on exactly what was going on.

729
00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.530
You also were symptomatic of sorts,

730
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:36.836
and taking people's energy on,

731
00:24:36.836 --> 00:24:39.936
and started developing blisters,

732
00:24:39.936 --> 00:24:42.396
and bleeding in your hands, and so forth.

733
00:24:42.396 --> 00:24:43.836
How did that enter into it,

734
00:24:43.836 --> 00:24:46.176
and when did you finally learn that

735
00:24:46.176 --> 00:24:48.123
you didn't need to carry that?

736
00:24:50.613 --> 00:24:53.273
<v ->I noticed after, well,</v>

737
00:24:53.273 --> 00:24:55.773
an orthopedist had sent a patient into me

738
00:24:55.773 --> 00:24:58.113
because I wasn't advertising this.

739
00:24:58.113 --> 00:24:59.253
They sent a patient in

740
00:24:59.253 --> 00:25:01.293
because I was a chiropractor,

741
00:25:01.293 --> 00:25:03.453
and the patient was in a car accident.

742
00:25:03.453 --> 00:25:05.193
After about a week and-a-half of working with her

743
00:25:05.193 --> 00:25:07.591
she was doing noticeably better,

744
00:25:07.591 --> 00:25:09.251
but this one day she came in with

745
00:25:09.251 --> 00:25:11.011
an unrelated problem

746
00:25:11.011 --> 00:25:12.771
to the automobile accident.

747
00:25:12.771 --> 00:25:14.251
She had had a bone disease

748
00:25:14.251 --> 00:25:15.651
since she was a young girl,

749
00:25:15.651 --> 00:25:18.291
and osteochondrosis, or an osteochondritis.

750
00:25:18.291 --> 00:25:19.307
There are different names you can call them,

751
00:25:19.307 --> 00:25:21.427
of her knee.

752
00:25:21.427 --> 00:25:23.205
She was now in her 40's,

753
00:25:23.205 --> 00:25:25.025
but it never completely healed.

754
00:25:25.025 --> 00:25:26.783
That's sort of characteristic of

755
00:25:26.783 --> 00:25:29.591
this particular degenerative process.

756
00:25:30.303 --> 00:25:31.761
Every once in a while it would act up,

757
00:25:31.761 --> 00:25:34.101
and nothing gets rid of it,

758
00:25:34.101 --> 00:25:35.601
and I tried everything I could.

759
00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:37.881
I tried massage, and ultrasound,

760
00:25:37.881 --> 00:25:39.581
and heat, and adjusting the joint,

761
00:25:39.581 --> 00:25:40.861
and everything you could think of,

762
00:25:40.861 --> 00:25:42.621
and nothing got rid of it.

763
00:25:42.621 --> 00:25:44.401
Finally, I said to her,

764
00:25:44.401 --> 00:25:46.441
"All right, we've done all these things today.

765
00:25:46.441 --> 00:25:48.021
"Now it's time for you to simply

766
00:25:48.021 --> 00:25:49.401
"just lie down on the table,

767
00:25:49.401 --> 00:25:50.421
"and close your eyes, rest,

768
00:25:50.421 --> 00:25:51.861
"and allow your body to assimilate

769
00:25:51.861 --> 00:25:53.301
"everything we've done,

770
00:25:53.301 --> 00:25:55.861
"and don't open your eyes until I tell you."

771
00:25:55.861 --> 00:25:57.181
Because I didn't want her to see that

772
00:25:57.181 --> 00:25:59.621
I brought my hand down over

773
00:25:59.621 --> 00:26:01.281
that problematic knee.

774
00:26:01.281 --> 00:26:03.421
I had to feel around for a sense

775
00:26:03.421 --> 00:26:05.461
because you could feel certain senses.

776
00:26:05.461 --> 00:26:06.641
It didn't matter.

777
00:26:06.641 --> 00:26:07.981
It's not what you're feeling,

778
00:26:07.981 --> 00:26:10.399
it's that you are feeling something.

779
00:26:10.399 --> 00:26:12.959
We get very lost in the concept of

780
00:26:12.959 --> 00:26:15.739
feeling we need to interpret and explain,

781
00:26:17.317 --> 00:26:19.057
and once we can accept,

782
00:26:19.057 --> 00:26:20.417
and be comfortable with the fact that

783
00:26:20.417 --> 00:26:23.597
we don't know, and we don't have to know,

784
00:26:23.957 --> 00:26:25.347
and in that freedom of not knowing

785
00:26:25.347 --> 00:26:27.297
we get to explore and discover.

786
00:26:28.107 --> 00:26:29.227
Well, that's a whole other issue.

787
00:26:29.227 --> 00:26:30.677
We'll go back to that.

788
00:26:32.027 --> 00:26:35.033
I felt a sense, I played with it for a few minutes,

789
00:26:35.665 --> 00:26:38.043
then I stopped because I didn't want

790
00:26:38.043 --> 00:26:39.203
her to open her eyes, and peek,

791
00:26:39.203 --> 00:26:40.523
and run back to the ortho going,

792
00:26:40.523 --> 00:26:42.427
"You know that crazy chiropractor you sent me to."

793
00:26:43.658 --> 00:26:44.976
And I said, "All right, we're finished now."

794
00:26:44.976 --> 00:26:46.155
And she opened her eyes, and she said

795
00:26:46.155 --> 00:26:47.993
her pain was gone.

796
00:26:47.993 --> 00:26:49.873
Okay, that was good.

797
00:26:49.873 --> 00:26:51.672
We walked out towards the front door,

798
00:26:51.672 --> 00:26:53.192
and my front desk receptionist

799
00:26:53.192 --> 00:26:55.492
almost fell off her stool

800
00:26:55.492 --> 00:26:57.012
because my palm had become covered

801
00:26:57.012 --> 00:26:59.492
with tiny little, millimeter sized blisters.

802
00:26:59.492 --> 00:27:02.252
I don't know, 75, 150, a slew of them,

803
00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:05.530
which instead of lasting blister time

804
00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:07.370
which is what three, four, five, six days

805
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:10.148
they were gone in less than three hours.

806
00:27:10.148 --> 00:27:11.788
So this happened on more than one occasion,

807
00:27:11.788 --> 00:27:14.110
and then, finally,

808
00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.960
my palm bled.

809
00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.226
Not like a stigmata,

810
00:27:19.226 --> 00:27:20.442
more as if you took a pin or needle,

811
00:27:20.442 --> 00:27:21.538
and you accidentally stuck your palm,

812
00:27:21.538 --> 00:27:22.738
that little bit of blood that comes out,

813
00:27:22.738 --> 00:27:23.498
and there it is,

814
00:27:23.498 --> 00:27:24.718
it's not really flowing anywhere,

815
00:27:24.718 --> 00:27:26.547
but blood just the same.

816
00:27:28.137 --> 00:27:30.527
And I watched as these things happened,

817
00:27:31.794 --> 00:27:33.175
because this was just

818
00:27:33.175 --> 00:27:35.534
a month or two into the process.

819
00:27:35.534 --> 00:27:38.214
A few months later I worked on someone

820
00:27:38.214 --> 00:27:40.634
who was in a very advanced state of HIV,

821
00:27:40.634 --> 00:27:42.194
the state that many of us have seen

822
00:27:42.194 --> 00:27:45.094
where the skin is kind of a translucent

823
00:27:45.094 --> 00:27:47.014
grayish, crinkly texture.

824
00:27:47.014 --> 00:27:49.154
He was very thin, in a lot of pain,

825
00:27:49.154 --> 00:27:52.394
weak looking, had an IV drip,

826
00:27:52.394 --> 00:27:54.454
bag of morphine for the pain,

827
00:27:54.454 --> 00:27:56.863
and probably helped his balance a little bit too.

828
00:27:58.274 --> 00:28:00.413
A friend asked because this was at

829
00:28:00.413 --> 00:28:01.473
a holiday dinner party,

830
00:28:01.473 --> 00:28:03.393
a friend asked if I would do a session with him,

831
00:28:03.393 --> 00:28:05.390
and I said, "Sure."

832
00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:07.109
I said, "I'll work with him a little bit

833
00:28:07.109 --> 00:28:09.618
"in one of the bedrooms back there."

834
00:28:11.548 --> 00:28:13.648
He told me that he had

835
00:28:13.648 --> 00:28:15.348
a complication from the HIV

836
00:28:15.348 --> 00:28:18.008
something called CMV, cytomegalovirus,

837
00:28:18.008 --> 00:28:20.867
which had affected one of his eyes,

838
00:28:20.867 --> 00:28:22.605
completely blurred the vision over,

839
00:28:22.605 --> 00:28:25.145
and he was very much afraid, obviously,

840
00:28:25.145 --> 00:28:26.623
that it might affect the other eye,

841
00:28:26.623 --> 00:28:27.623
so would I do a session.

842
00:28:27.623 --> 00:28:29.561
I said, "We'll see what happens,"

843
00:28:29.561 --> 00:28:31.189
so I did a session for a few minutes.

844
00:28:32.319 --> 00:28:34.139
He said his pain was mostly gone.

845
00:28:34.139 --> 00:28:36.579
Well, that was pretty much all I expected at most,

846
00:28:36.579 --> 00:28:37.879
so I left him alone,

847
00:28:37.879 --> 00:28:39.779
and I went out to rejoin the group.

848
00:28:39.779 --> 00:28:41.339
A few minutes later he came out

849
00:28:41.339 --> 00:28:44.497
announcing that he could see perfectly clearly

850
00:28:44.497 --> 00:28:45.817
through both of his eyes.

851
00:28:45.817 --> 00:28:47.765
He was very excited about that, obviously.

852
00:28:47.765 --> 00:28:49.117
I became excited about it

853
00:28:49.117 --> 00:28:51.651
the next day for an entirely different reason

854
00:28:52.301 --> 00:28:54.289
because my eye, my opposite eye,

855
00:28:54.289 --> 00:28:55.449
I don't know why it was always

856
00:28:55.449 --> 00:28:57.637
the opposite side of my body

857
00:28:57.637 --> 00:29:00.375
swelled up about three times its normal size.

858
00:29:01.181 --> 00:29:02.761
I've got to tell you.

859
00:29:02.761 --> 00:29:04.001
<v Voiceover>Not attractive.</v>

860
00:29:04.001 --> 00:29:06.097
<v ->Not attractive.</v>

861
00:29:06.097 --> 00:29:08.797
I didn't really mind the blisters or the blood.

862
00:29:08.797 --> 00:29:11.797
I sort of enjoyed the evidence,

863
00:29:11.797 --> 00:29:14.897
the physical evidence, the drama really,

864
00:29:14.897 --> 00:29:16.977
in a sense of being able to share this

865
00:29:16.977 --> 00:29:18.417
with my friends when I got home.

866
00:29:18.417 --> 00:29:19.213
"Look what happened, look at this."

867
00:29:19.213 --> 00:29:20.533
<v Voiceover>But to have a bulgy eye.</v>

868
00:29:20.533 --> 00:29:22.153
<v ->Yeah, yeah, yeah,</v>

869
00:29:22.153 --> 00:29:24.713
so the eye spooked me

870
00:29:24.713 --> 00:29:25.993
because I was concerned

871
00:29:25.993 --> 00:29:27.073
did I take something on?

872
00:29:27.073 --> 00:29:28.973
Would it leave residuals?

873
00:29:28.973 --> 00:29:30.913
Would it leave period?

874
00:29:30.913 --> 00:29:31.977
And I truly learned the meaning

875
00:29:31.977 --> 00:29:34.843
of the word obsessed for the next 36 hours.

876
00:29:36.169 --> 00:29:38.927
Until, finally, it came to me

877
00:29:40.357 --> 00:29:42.681
that maybe I didn't need to physically

878
00:29:44.511 --> 00:29:48.031
manifest another person's symptoms

879
00:29:49.167 --> 00:29:51.095
for that person to have a healing.

880
00:29:53.145 --> 00:29:55.675
At the moment that I got that

881
00:29:56.681 --> 00:29:59.641
I never had to physically manifest again,

882
00:29:59.641 --> 00:30:01.521
and the healings rose.

883
00:30:01.521 --> 00:30:03.127
Now there's a lot

884
00:30:04.079 --> 00:30:06.217
in these stories

885
00:30:06.217 --> 00:30:07.925
that we're talking about right now.

886
00:30:09.555 --> 00:30:11.235
I'm on the road about 45 weeks a year

887
00:30:11.235 --> 00:30:13.243
doing seminars.

888
00:30:15.453 --> 00:30:16.453
That usually means there's

889
00:30:16.453 --> 00:30:17.673
a Friday evening portion,

890
00:30:17.673 --> 00:30:18.713
and then there's a Saturday,

891
00:30:18.713 --> 00:30:19.613
and Sunday teaching.

892
00:30:19.613 --> 00:30:20.852
Friday evening is open to the public,

893
00:30:20.852 --> 00:30:23.572
and what happens is I go into much more,

894
00:30:23.572 --> 00:30:25.872
it's about three hours of the history,

895
00:30:25.872 --> 00:30:28.312
more of the science behind it,

896
00:30:28.312 --> 00:30:30.052
and we do demonstrations on

897
00:30:30.052 --> 00:30:31.172
audience volunteers,

898
00:30:31.172 --> 00:30:32.852
so you can see how the body physically

899
00:30:32.852 --> 00:30:33.992
responds and moves,

900
00:30:33.992 --> 00:30:35.892
and the changes that go on.

901
00:30:35.892 --> 00:30:38.374
I know that

902
00:30:38.374 --> 00:30:40.274
there is transformation,

903
00:30:40.274 --> 00:30:42.594
and healing in the telling of this story,

904
00:30:42.594 --> 00:30:44.174
and the hearing of this story.

905
00:30:44.174 --> 00:30:45.394
I don't know exactly how.

906
00:30:45.394 --> 00:30:47.434
It's not like I've intended coded words.

907
00:30:47.434 --> 00:30:49.494
I know it happens from the book.

908
00:30:49.494 --> 00:30:50.914
For God's sake the editor at Hay House

909
00:30:50.914 --> 00:30:52.165
would call me all the time going,

910
00:30:52.165 --> 00:30:53.596
"I can't read this book.

911
00:30:53.596 --> 00:30:55.316
"Every time I pick it up my hands are buzzing.

912
00:30:55.316 --> 00:30:56.396
"I don't know how I'm going to

913
00:30:56.396 --> 00:30:57.127
"get through this."

914
00:30:57.127 --> 00:30:59.247
I can't wait to tell her that I've decided

915
00:30:59.247 --> 00:31:00.478
I'm about to write my second book.

916
00:31:00.478 --> 00:31:02.158
That will throw her to no end,

917
00:31:02.158 --> 00:31:03.691
but, anyway,

918
00:31:05.021 --> 00:31:06.921
there are things, and healing,

919
00:31:06.921 --> 00:31:08.561
and transformation, and insights

920
00:31:08.561 --> 00:31:09.961
that come from this story on levels

921
00:31:09.961 --> 00:31:12.279
that I don't truly understand,

922
00:31:12.279 --> 00:31:15.047
but I recognize this one point.

923
00:31:17.455 --> 00:31:19.255
We don't need to physically take something on

924
00:31:19.255 --> 00:31:20.795
for another person to have a healing.

925
00:31:20.795 --> 00:31:23.483
Now this relates to a lot

926
00:31:25.467 --> 00:31:27.927
of I can explain this.

927
00:31:27.927 --> 00:31:30.341
There are certain investment points

928
00:31:30.341 --> 00:31:33.521
in people who consider themselves,

929
00:31:33.521 --> 00:31:36.528
or work to function as healers.

930
00:31:38.638 --> 00:31:39.858
They overlap in different ways,

931
00:31:39.858 --> 00:31:42.978
but one often spins right around this concept

932
00:31:42.978 --> 00:31:45.128
of taking things on.

933
00:31:48.438 --> 00:31:50.298
And you don't have to,

934
00:31:50.298 --> 00:31:51.844
and that's the answer,

935
00:31:52.938 --> 00:31:54.574
but we need to open up this answer,

936
00:31:54.574 --> 00:31:57.414
so that some of us will allow ourselves

937
00:31:57.414 --> 00:31:59.324
to accept that answer.

938
00:32:02.354 --> 00:32:03.794
In bringing this work through

939
00:32:03.794 --> 00:32:06.032
what we are doing is we're bringing in

940
00:32:06.032 --> 00:32:08.092
light and information.

941
00:32:08.092 --> 00:32:09.901
This is not energy healing

942
00:32:11.132 --> 00:32:12.999
in the way

943
00:32:14.009 --> 00:32:16.489
a bad cup of coffee

944
00:32:16.489 --> 00:32:19.129
would not be coffee, you know,

945
00:32:19.129 --> 00:32:20.329
"God, that's not coffee."

946
00:32:20.329 --> 00:32:21.047
I don't know what I'm talking about.

947
00:32:21.047 --> 00:32:22.327
I don't drink coffee, but if I did,

948
00:32:22.327 --> 00:32:23.785
you get the concept.

949
00:32:23.785 --> 00:32:25.955
It's energy healing, and so much more.

950
00:32:28.765 --> 00:32:31.185
What we found in the research,

951
00:32:31.185 --> 00:32:33.565
and in the work with this

952
00:32:33.565 --> 00:32:35.645
is that this carries everything

953
00:32:35.645 --> 00:32:37.105
we've ever had access to

954
00:32:37.105 --> 00:32:38.645
on the planet before,

955
00:32:38.645 --> 00:32:39.805
and runs beyond it.

956
00:32:41.301 --> 00:32:43.641
It includes Reiki, and Jin Shin,

957
00:32:43.641 --> 00:32:45.095
and Qigong, and Mahjong, and Beijing,

958
00:32:45.095 --> 00:32:46.135
and all the other things,

959
00:32:46.135 --> 00:32:47.713
and the ABC, and the DEF techniques,

960
00:32:47.713 --> 00:32:49.073
and whatever we want to call them

961
00:32:49.073 --> 00:32:52.111
because those are parts of energy.

962
00:32:52.111 --> 00:32:53.931
What we've had,

963
00:32:53.931 --> 00:32:54.891
or where we went to before is,

964
00:32:54.891 --> 00:32:57.123
A, we had to recognize we're four-dimensional.

965
00:32:57.123 --> 00:32:58.723
I never went to the second part of that.

966
00:32:58.723 --> 00:32:59.719
Height, width, depth, and time,

967
00:32:59.719 --> 00:33:01.759
and time is the fourth dimension.

968
00:33:01.759 --> 00:33:04.479
The other concept the researchers explained

969
00:33:04.479 --> 00:33:07.419
is time is moving faster,

970
00:33:07.419 --> 00:33:08.639
and that's our lay term,

971
00:33:08.639 --> 00:33:09.995
and that's what's popular.

972
00:33:09.995 --> 00:33:11.455
Gregg Braden talks about it,

973
00:33:11.455 --> 00:33:14.491
calls it the Shift of the Ages.

974
00:33:14.491 --> 00:33:16.979
It's been predicted by the Mayans, the Hopis.

975
00:33:16.979 --> 00:33:20.191
Course in Miracles talks about it, Nostradamus,

976
00:33:20.191 --> 00:33:22.151
all happening around this time

977
00:33:22.151 --> 00:33:23.411
there's a shift in time,

978
00:33:23.411 --> 00:33:24.987
and we talk about it moving faster

979
00:33:24.987 --> 00:33:26.773
because it feels faster,

980
00:33:27.823 --> 00:33:29.489
but it's not faster

981
00:33:30.639 --> 00:33:32.759
because if it were just faster

982
00:33:32.759 --> 00:33:34.239
we'd be getting less done.

983
00:33:34.239 --> 00:33:35.039
"Time went by so quickly

984
00:33:35.039 --> 00:33:36.695
"I couldn't get anything done."

985
00:33:36.695 --> 00:33:38.335
We're getting more done.

986
00:33:38.335 --> 00:33:41.085
What's happening is time is actually expanding.

987
00:33:42.235 --> 00:33:44.055
It feels faster, and yet it's opening up,

988
00:33:44.055 --> 00:33:45.951
and we're accomplishing more,

989
00:33:45.951 --> 00:33:48.411
so if we overlay these two concepts

990
00:33:48.411 --> 00:33:50.531
here we are existing in our little

991
00:33:50.531 --> 00:33:51.851
four-dimensional playground

992
00:33:51.851 --> 00:33:54.255
in a huge multi-dimensional universe,

993
00:33:55.527 --> 00:33:58.405
and yet one side of our playground,

994
00:33:58.405 --> 00:34:01.705
the time side begins to open up and expand,

995
00:34:03.143 --> 00:34:05.271
then what happens to the capacity

996
00:34:05.901 --> 00:34:07.501
in which we play now.

997
00:34:07.501 --> 00:34:09.381
The capacity of our playground opens up,

998
00:34:09.381 --> 00:34:11.661
expands, and we're able to receive more,

999
00:34:11.661 --> 00:34:13.621
so where we might have had

1000
00:34:13.621 --> 00:34:16.181
the "R" for Reiki, and the "J" for Jin Shin,

1001
00:34:16.181 --> 00:34:17.139
and the Q for Qigong,

1002
00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:20.059
all of a sudden the rest of

1003
00:34:20.059 --> 00:34:23.397
the consonants start to come in, and we go,

1004
00:34:23.397 --> 00:34:25.891
"Hmm, now we have the rest of energy healing,

1005
00:34:25.891 --> 00:34:28.279
"but we'll call it consonant healing."

1006
00:34:29.451 --> 00:34:31.817
All of a sudden we discover there are vowels.

1007
00:34:33.807 --> 00:34:34.867
All of a sudden we discover

1008
00:34:34.867 --> 00:34:36.707
there's more to the band.

1009
00:34:36.707 --> 00:34:38.027
We've gone beyond the energy

1010
00:34:38.027 --> 00:34:39.307
that we've had now,

1011
00:34:39.307 --> 00:34:41.027
filled in the rest of what we didn't have,

1012
00:34:41.027 --> 00:34:43.903
gliding into light, and into information,

1013
00:34:43.903 --> 00:34:46.023
which is also fascinating if you look at it

1014
00:34:46.023 --> 00:34:48.551
from the concept of we're entering,

1015
00:34:49.203 --> 00:34:51.541
as many people speak of anyway,

1016
00:34:51.541 --> 00:34:53.741
we're entering the photon belt.

1017
00:34:53.741 --> 00:34:56.041
Now the first time someone said

1018
00:34:56.041 --> 00:34:57.201
the photon belt to me

1019
00:34:57.201 --> 00:34:58.959
I knew as much about the photon belt

1020
00:34:58.959 --> 00:35:02.099
as, I guess, I could boil it all down to

1021
00:35:02.099 --> 00:35:02.915
you probably couldn't get

1022
00:35:02.915 --> 00:35:04.295
a good pair of shoes to match,

1023
00:35:04.295 --> 00:35:05.499
I mean that was about it.

1024
00:35:05.499 --> 00:35:07.459
What is this photon belt?

1025
00:35:07.459 --> 00:35:09.339
Yet as we look at what the photon is

1026
00:35:09.339 --> 00:35:11.445
we recognize that the photon...

1027
00:35:13.435 --> 00:35:14.895
All right, I hesitate to say recognize

1028
00:35:14.895 --> 00:35:17.561
because the level

1029
00:35:18.651 --> 00:35:19.931
that we understand

1030
00:35:19.931 --> 00:35:22.031
through science and physics right now

1031
00:35:22.031 --> 00:35:24.249
feels that the photon is

1032
00:35:24.249 --> 00:35:26.497
the tiniest bundle of light

1033
00:35:27.069 --> 00:35:29.467
that we know of,

1034
00:35:31.603 --> 00:35:34.163
but it's also the tiniest bundle of energy

1035
00:35:34.163 --> 00:35:36.181
that we know of,

1036
00:35:36.181 --> 00:35:37.741
and it's also the tiniest bundle

1037
00:35:37.741 --> 00:35:41.221
of information that we know of,

1038
00:35:41.221 --> 00:35:43.641
and suddenly we find that there's

1039
00:35:43.641 --> 00:35:45.561
this broader, more comprehensive

1040
00:35:45.561 --> 00:35:48.709
form of healing way beyond energy healing,

1041
00:35:49.221 --> 00:35:51.139
way beyond technique,

1042
00:35:51.139 --> 00:35:53.699
and what happens it takes us beyond energy

1043
00:35:53.699 --> 00:35:56.195
in the light information.

1044
00:35:56.195 --> 00:35:58.343
It responds differently.

1045
00:35:59.373 --> 00:36:02.151
Energy healing becomes weaker with distance.

1046
00:36:02.151 --> 00:36:03.311
I'm not talking distance like

1047
00:36:03.311 --> 00:36:04.431
New Jersey to California.

1048
00:36:04.431 --> 00:36:06.531
I'm talking proximal distance.

1049
00:36:06.531 --> 00:36:08.771
As you pull apart energy becomes weaker.

1050
00:36:08.771 --> 00:36:10.511
This becomes stronger.

1051
00:36:10.511 --> 00:36:12.651
It changes on so many different levels.

1052
00:36:12.651 --> 00:36:14.711
It expands, it opens up,

1053
00:36:14.711 --> 00:36:16.831
so this seems to be something new

1054
00:36:16.831 --> 00:36:19.211
that whatever we've had before

1055
00:36:19.211 --> 00:36:21.691
we can feed right into this system,

1056
00:36:21.691 --> 00:36:24.069
and suddenly open up to the rest of it

1057
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:25.407
once we interact.

1058
00:36:25.407 --> 00:36:27.787
<v Voiceover>So this would bring us into</v>

1059
00:36:27.787 --> 00:36:30.267
expanded possibilities for

1060
00:36:30.267 --> 00:36:32.133
remote healing even.

1061
00:36:33.443 --> 00:36:34.743
In particular, remote healing

1062
00:36:34.743 --> 00:36:36.241
you don't have to be in the presence of

1063
00:36:36.241 --> 00:36:38.001
a person in order to help them

1064
00:36:38.001 --> 00:36:40.659
initiate this receiving of light and information.

1065
00:36:40.659 --> 00:36:42.075
<v ->Absolutely,</v>

1066
00:36:42.075 --> 00:36:43.875
what some people refer to as

1067
00:36:43.875 --> 00:36:45.471
long distance healing.

1068
00:36:45.471 --> 00:36:46.511
I keep having to remind them

1069
00:36:46.511 --> 00:36:48.905
that would be AT&amp;T, it's distance healing.

1070
00:36:49.779 --> 00:36:51.259
<v Voiceover>Right, what about</v>

1071
00:36:51.259 --> 00:36:53.175
the whole subject of,

1072
00:36:53.175 --> 00:36:54.571
and you do bring this up in your book,

1073
00:36:54.571 --> 00:36:56.631
the subject of love,

1074
00:36:56.631 --> 00:36:59.871
the vibration, or frequency known as love

1075
00:36:59.871 --> 00:37:01.711
which so often is brought up

1076
00:37:01.711 --> 00:37:03.351
in so many people's work

1077
00:37:03.351 --> 00:37:05.591
that it comes down to love,

1078
00:37:05.591 --> 00:37:08.451
and you, from what I understand,

1079
00:37:08.451 --> 00:37:11.431
would say love isn't exactly,

1080
00:37:11.431 --> 00:37:13.071
you wouldn't put exactly

1081
00:37:13.071 --> 00:37:15.831
the same definition on it that some would.

1082
00:37:15.831 --> 00:37:17.311
Can you talk about that frequency

1083
00:37:17.311 --> 00:37:19.397
a little bit and the way you perceive it.

1084
00:37:23.167 --> 00:37:24.767
<v ->If you speak to someone who has had</v>

1085
00:37:24.767 --> 00:37:26.387
a life after death experience,

1086
00:37:26.387 --> 00:37:28.131
I mean the real one

1087
00:37:28.131 --> 00:37:29.491
where you've gone out,

1088
00:37:29.491 --> 00:37:31.571
you've been presented to the light,

1089
00:37:31.571 --> 00:37:33.391
your life has been laid out,

1090
00:37:33.391 --> 00:37:34.571
you've seen the people around you,

1091
00:37:34.571 --> 00:37:37.071
you gained many of the understandings

1092
00:37:37.071 --> 00:37:38.951
of the universe.

1093
00:37:38.951 --> 00:37:42.569
You'll find that they'll explain to you

1094
00:37:44.075 --> 00:37:46.313
that they can explain to you

1095
00:37:47.115 --> 00:37:49.423
that feeling of what love is,

1096
00:37:49.423 --> 00:37:50.882
but what is isn't

1097
00:37:51.299 --> 00:37:54.191
is that sentimental,

1098
00:37:54.191 --> 00:37:56.558
Hallmark greeting card,

1099
00:37:56.558 --> 00:37:59.253
get a tear, feel someone's pain, love.

1100
00:38:02.123 --> 00:38:04.789
It's beyond sentiment,

1101
00:38:06.533 --> 00:38:08.403
or sadness,

1102
00:38:09.815 --> 00:38:12.131
or feeling someone else in that form

1103
00:38:12.131 --> 00:38:14.671
to something that's all expansive,

1104
00:38:14.671 --> 00:38:17.761
knowing, understanding, welcoming.

1105
00:38:20.251 --> 00:38:22.767
When these healings first started to occur,

1106
00:38:22.767 --> 00:38:24.903
and remember, I had no reading,

1107
00:38:24.903 --> 00:38:26.363
or background understanding of this.

1108
00:38:26.363 --> 00:38:27.443
I went home on a Friday

1109
00:38:27.443 --> 00:38:28.563
thinking I was a chiropractor.

1110
00:38:28.563 --> 00:38:30.423
I came in on a Monday,

1111
00:38:30.423 --> 00:38:31.663
and I was something else.

1112
00:38:31.663 --> 00:38:33.339
It's not as if people haven't all my life

1113
00:38:33.339 --> 00:38:34.419
told me I was something else,

1114
00:38:34.419 --> 00:38:36.265
but this was not what they meant.

1115
00:38:38.151 --> 00:38:39.451
I would adjust my patient,

1116
00:38:39.451 --> 00:38:40.667
and tell them to close their eyes, and relax.

1117
00:38:40.667 --> 00:38:41.807
I would hold my hand by them,

1118
00:38:41.807 --> 00:38:42.907
and all of a sudden their eyes

1119
00:38:42.907 --> 00:38:43.687
would start to move,

1120
00:38:43.687 --> 00:38:45.687
or their fingers, or their feet involuntarily,

1121
00:38:45.687 --> 00:38:48.445
and the muscles were moving in their faces.

1122
00:38:49.595 --> 00:38:51.995
There was a three month period of time

1123
00:38:51.995 --> 00:38:54.471
where they actually would lose consciousness.

1124
00:38:54.471 --> 00:38:56.889
Over 50 different patients

1125
00:38:56.889 --> 00:38:58.829
brought through, and spoke

1126
00:38:58.829 --> 00:39:01.225
these same six phrases verbatim.

1127
00:39:01.225 --> 00:39:02.315
I mean there was a lot of strange stuff happening.

1128
00:39:02.315 --> 00:39:03.325
<v Voiceover>You're talking about spontaneous</v>

1129
00:39:03.325 --> 00:39:05.315
channelings with your clients

1130
00:39:05.315 --> 00:39:07.255
who hadn't done this sort of thing before.

1131
00:39:07.255 --> 00:39:08.195
It frightened them,

1132
00:39:08.195 --> 00:39:10.047
and some of them ran away, right?

1133
00:39:10.047 --> 00:39:11.089
<v ->And others came back.</v>

1134
00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:11.827
<v Voiceover>But they kept giving you</v>

1135
00:39:11.827 --> 00:39:13.487
the same message, different people.

1136
00:39:13.487 --> 00:39:15.593
<v ->The same six phrases consistently.</v>

1137
00:39:15.593 --> 00:39:16.933
<v Voiceover>Would you care to share those?</v>

1138
00:39:16.933 --> 00:39:19.807
<v ->Sure, and that totally leaves</v>

1139
00:39:19.807 --> 00:39:21.267
everyone else without the answer

1140
00:39:21.267 --> 00:39:23.033
to the last question,

1141
00:39:23.903 --> 00:39:25.463
but I can do that,

1142
00:39:25.463 --> 00:39:27.223
especially, because I lost where I was,

1143
00:39:27.223 --> 00:39:28.281
and I can do that.

1144
00:39:28.281 --> 00:39:29.081
<v Voiceover>You were talking about how</v>

1145
00:39:29.081 --> 00:39:31.439
these people as they were in your presence

1146
00:39:31.439 --> 00:39:32.715
at this time started having

1147
00:39:32.715 --> 00:39:34.455
spontaneous experiences.

1148
00:39:34.455 --> 00:39:36.075
<v ->We'll lead it back into the six phrases</v>

1149
00:39:36.075 --> 00:39:37.944
if you just remind me.

1150
00:39:40.052 --> 00:39:41.412
So I figured I better find out

1151
00:39:41.412 --> 00:39:43.170
what's going on here.

1152
00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:44.930
This is some form of healing

1153
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:46.453
healers must understand this.

1154
00:39:46.453 --> 00:39:47.273
I don't know what it is.

1155
00:39:47.273 --> 00:39:48.411
Where do we find healers?

1156
00:39:48.411 --> 00:39:49.831
So quick,

1157
00:39:49.831 --> 00:39:52.237
I went to the health food store

1158
00:39:52.237 --> 00:39:53.731
where I saw they had the magazines,

1159
00:39:53.731 --> 00:39:55.530
The Whole Life this, and The New Earth that,

1160
00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:56.510
and blah, blah, blah,

1161
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:57.630
and I flipped to the back where all

1162
00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:58.850
the healers advertised, you know,

1163
00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:01.370
you've seen those elongated business card size

1164
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:03.030
ads that, you know,

1165
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:04.469
"Come to me, I'm Larry, light worker,"

1166
00:40:04.469 --> 00:40:05.489
and "Charlie Channeler,"

1167
00:40:05.489 --> 00:40:07.409
and "Lou Lou La-La,"

1168
00:40:07.409 --> 00:40:09.369
and whatever, you know, "Rudolph Raindrop,"

1169
00:40:09.369 --> 00:40:10.468
and there are their photographs,

1170
00:40:10.468 --> 00:40:12.348
so I decided to call the ones whose pictures

1171
00:40:12.348 --> 00:40:14.806
made them look the most sane,

1172
00:40:14.806 --> 00:40:16.455
both of them,

1173
00:40:17.246 --> 00:40:18.885
and so, anyway, I called the first person,

1174
00:40:18.885 --> 00:40:20.005
and I tell him what's going on,

1175
00:40:20.005 --> 00:40:20.844
and he said "Well come down.

1176
00:40:20.844 --> 00:40:21.784
"I'll have some people over,

1177
00:40:21.784 --> 00:40:23.204
"you can demonstrate," I said, "Fine,"

1178
00:40:23.204 --> 00:40:25.323
so I drove over to the first place.

1179
00:40:25.323 --> 00:40:26.183
I showed him what it was,

1180
00:40:26.183 --> 00:40:27.063
the people on the table,

1181
00:40:27.063 --> 00:40:28.463
the body started doing the same things

1182
00:40:28.463 --> 00:40:29.863
that were going on in my office,

1183
00:40:29.863 --> 00:40:31.203
and some of them started.

1184
00:40:31.203 --> 00:40:33.379
The little, tiny involuntary muscles

1185
00:40:33.379 --> 00:40:34.639
began to move around the face,

1186
00:40:34.639 --> 00:40:35.539
and the eyes, and the ears,

1187
00:40:35.539 --> 00:40:37.715
things we can't move by intention.

1188
00:40:37.715 --> 00:40:40.135
Some of them began to speak again

1189
00:40:40.135 --> 00:40:42.435
the same phrases without anyone knowing

1190
00:40:42.435 --> 00:40:44.161
what these phrases were.

1191
00:40:48.107 --> 00:40:49.947
I would say, "What do you suggest?"

1192
00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:51.041
They said: "Well, you're using protection,

1193
00:40:51.041 --> 00:40:51.961
"aren't you?" and I thought,

1194
00:40:51.961 --> 00:40:53.355
"Well, that's a little personal,

1195
00:40:53.355 --> 00:40:54.361
"what do you mean?"

1196
00:40:54.361 --> 00:40:55.535
They said: "You have to use protection,"

1197
00:40:55.535 --> 00:40:56.515
and they started telling me

1198
00:40:56.515 --> 00:40:57.673
how I needed to protect myself

1199
00:40:57.673 --> 00:40:59.013
which I won't go into a whole thing here,

1200
00:40:59.013 --> 00:41:00.533
but one person is telling me to

1201
00:41:00.533 --> 00:41:01.669
call him Mother-Father God,

1202
00:41:01.669 --> 00:41:03.127
and so I'm trying to figure out how to do that.

1203
00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:04.805
The next one has me bring in the archangels,

1204
00:41:04.805 --> 00:41:07.441
and someone else wants Sananda,

1205
00:41:07.441 --> 00:41:08.961
and someone else wants Jesus,

1206
00:41:08.961 --> 00:41:10.421
but Sananda is the star name for Jesus,

1207
00:41:10.421 --> 00:41:11.299
but you need both of them.

1208
00:41:11.299 --> 00:41:13.535
I guess it's a Patty Catty thing going on,

1209
00:41:13.535 --> 00:41:15.691
and you know pretty soon

1210
00:41:15.691 --> 00:41:17.409
this one wants you to say the prayer,

1211
00:41:17.409 --> 00:41:18.469
and there's so much ritual,

1212
00:41:18.469 --> 00:41:19.585
and fear going on.

1213
00:41:19.585 --> 00:41:21.163
<v Voiceover>Crystals, candles, water.</v>

1214
00:41:21.163 --> 00:41:22.829
<v ->Oh my God.</v>

1215
00:41:23.559 --> 00:41:25.745
My God, it's like we forget

1216
00:41:27.057 --> 00:41:28.803
that we are truth,

1217
00:41:30.035 --> 00:41:32.763
and in that we vibrated a level of light,

1218
00:41:34.769 --> 00:41:36.991
and anything denser than light

1219
00:41:36.991 --> 00:41:38.609
has nothing to hold onto,

1220
00:41:38.609 --> 00:41:41.689
which includes our health challenges

1221
00:41:42.687 --> 00:41:43.557
which is why we don't need

1222
00:41:43.557 --> 00:41:44.577
to take anything on.

1223
00:41:44.577 --> 00:41:45.936
Lord knows how I got back to that point,

1224
00:41:45.936 --> 00:41:47.195
right now, which is why

1225
00:41:47.195 --> 00:41:48.695
we don't need to take anything on

1226
00:41:48.695 --> 00:41:50.095
because we simply need to remember

1227
00:41:50.095 --> 00:41:51.175
that we are the light,

1228
00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:52.855
and in that memory,

1229
00:41:52.855 --> 00:41:54.015
in that reminder to ourselves

1230
00:41:54.015 --> 00:41:55.435
we don't have to worry about how to.

1231
00:41:55.435 --> 00:41:56.955
We don't have to try to feel it.

1232
00:41:56.955 --> 00:41:58.235
We don't have to go out in the sun.

1233
00:41:58.235 --> 00:42:01.135
We don't need to take homeopathic drops

1234
00:42:01.135 --> 00:42:03.686
that we don't need to do anything but go,

1235
00:42:03.686 --> 00:42:06.386
"Oh yeah, I am the light."

1236
00:42:06.386 --> 00:42:08.086
Because we know who we are.

1237
00:42:08.086 --> 00:42:09.326
We begin to vibrate at that level,

1238
00:42:09.326 --> 00:42:12.186
and, therefore, when we begin to

1239
00:42:12.186 --> 00:42:13.686
interact with another person

1240
00:42:13.686 --> 00:42:16.566
who might come to us for a healing session

1241
00:42:16.566 --> 00:42:19.306
they feel, they are reminded in our presence

1242
00:42:19.306 --> 00:42:21.802
of that light vibration, and they'll say,

1243
00:42:21.802 --> 00:42:24.442
"Oh yeah, I remember who I am, this is me,"

1244
00:42:24.442 --> 00:42:26.668
and they start to vibrate at that level.

1245
00:42:27.438 --> 00:42:28.998
The health challenges that

1246
00:42:28.998 --> 00:42:30.458
are appropriate to do this

1247
00:42:30.458 --> 00:42:33.418
at this point in time in their lives fall away.

1248
00:42:33.418 --> 00:42:35.996
In that process there is no

1249
00:42:35.996 --> 00:42:37.856
taking anything on,

1250
00:42:37.856 --> 00:42:40.712
but what we tend to do is buy into

1251
00:42:40.712 --> 00:42:42.292
the illusions of fear,

1252
00:42:42.292 --> 00:42:43.812
protect yourself from this,

1253
00:42:43.812 --> 00:42:45.052
watch out for that,

1254
00:42:45.052 --> 00:42:46.752
shake off the negative energy.

1255
00:42:46.752 --> 00:42:48.272
Oh can you believe how these people

1256
00:42:48.272 --> 00:42:49.958
get caught up in this?

1257
00:42:50.986 --> 00:42:52.404
One guy that said to me,

1258
00:42:52.404 --> 00:42:53.404
"You're shaking your hands off

1259
00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:54.364
"during the sessions, aren't you?"

1260
00:42:54.364 --> 00:42:55.182
And I said "What do you mean?

1261
00:42:55.182 --> 00:42:57.182
"They're still here, what do you mean?

1262
00:42:57.182 --> 00:42:57.902
"What do you mean?"

1263
00:42:57.902 --> 00:42:58.622
He said "Shake them off,"

1264
00:42:58.622 --> 00:42:59.182
I said, "But what do you mean?"

1265
00:42:59.182 --> 00:42:59.842
He said, "Shake them off."

1266
00:42:59.842 --> 00:43:00.622
I said, "What do you mean?"

1267
00:43:00.622 --> 00:43:01.342
He said, "Shake them off."

1268
00:43:01.342 --> 00:43:03.702
I said, "You mean like this."

1269
00:43:03.702 --> 00:43:05.182
He went, "No, not towards me,"

1270
00:43:05.182 --> 00:43:06.502
and he goes to the back.

1271
00:43:06.502 --> 00:43:08.982
You have to shake them off into a bowl of water,

1272
00:43:08.982 --> 00:43:10.222
but that bowl of water has to be

1273
00:43:10.222 --> 00:43:12.562
large enough so you don't get any on you

1274
00:43:12.562 --> 00:43:14.142
which is the last thing you say to anyone

1275
00:43:14.142 --> 00:43:16.362
whose maybe obsessive/compulsive, right?

1276
00:43:16.362 --> 00:43:17.362
Because I don't care

1277
00:43:17.362 --> 00:43:18.182
how big a bowl you give me.

1278
00:43:18.182 --> 00:43:20.050
I could imagine splashing in, splashing out.

1279
00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:21.378
Anyway, you go up and down

1280
00:43:21.378 --> 00:43:22.338
the body three times,

1281
00:43:22.338 --> 00:43:23.498
you shake the negative energy off,

1282
00:43:23.498 --> 00:43:24.378
the water catches it,

1283
00:43:24.378 --> 00:43:26.158
but it could escape,

1284
00:43:26.158 --> 00:43:28.278
so you have to put salt in it.

1285
00:43:28.278 --> 00:43:30.878
Not any salt, sea salt, medium grade,

1286
00:43:30.878 --> 00:43:32.418
but kosher will do,

1287
00:43:32.418 --> 00:43:33.578
up and down the body three times,

1288
00:43:33.578 --> 00:43:34.378
shake your hands off,

1289
00:43:34.378 --> 00:43:35.058
up and down three times,

1290
00:43:35.058 --> 00:43:35.976
shake your hands off.

1291
00:43:35.976 --> 00:43:37.836
You can use that bowl for up to three people,

1292
00:43:37.836 --> 00:43:39.034
but then its got to be changed,

1293
00:43:39.034 --> 00:43:40.848
oop, but you can't change it.

1294
00:43:40.848 --> 00:43:42.220
<v Voiceover>You have a lot of clients each day too.</v>

1295
00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.664
<v ->Someone else had to.</v>

1296
00:43:43.664 --> 00:43:45.816
So he sent over three different,

1297
00:43:45.816 --> 00:43:48.166
what I call "Moonies" to sit in my office and watch.

1298
00:43:48.166 --> 00:43:49.726
I had like 10 different rooms.

1299
00:43:49.726 --> 00:43:51.104
Any time a given room

1300
00:43:51.104 --> 00:43:52.326
was used for the third time,

1301
00:43:52.326 --> 00:43:53.364
one of them would go in to take out

1302
00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:54.904
the dirty saltwater bowl.

1303
00:43:54.904 --> 00:43:56.760
One of them will have mixed up a fresh one.

1304
00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.120
They do the little dance around each other

1305
00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:00.436
with the clean/dirty water bowl dance,

1306
00:44:00.436 --> 00:44:01.616
and they put the new one in.

1307
00:44:01.616 --> 00:44:03.696
If you think that didn't make my patients nervous

1308
00:44:03.696 --> 00:44:05.532
you have a whole other thing coming.

1309
00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:09.348
What happens is

1310
00:44:09.348 --> 00:44:11.368
we allow ourselves to feel

1311
00:44:11.368 --> 00:44:13.408
that we need some protection

1312
00:44:13.408 --> 00:44:15.396
which then brings about

1313
00:44:16.108 --> 00:44:19.382
for us makes more concrete

1314
00:44:19.382 --> 00:44:21.942
the illusion of fear that we carry

1315
00:44:21.942 --> 00:44:23.522
that there might be evil,

1316
00:44:23.522 --> 00:44:25.042
so then we find a new protection,

1317
00:44:25.042 --> 00:44:26.382
a purple flame,

1318
00:44:26.382 --> 00:44:27.900
and you know there's also a white flame.

1319
00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:30.280
Well there's a gold flame is one better,

1320
00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.660
already this is fear-based.

1321
00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:32.636
Do we add all three?

1322
00:44:32.636 --> 00:44:33.816
Do we put the gold on the inside

1323
00:44:33.816 --> 00:44:35.176
because it's reflective to protect from

1324
00:44:35.176 --> 00:44:37.226
the other two are on the outside?

1325
00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:40.288
And so what happens is

1326
00:44:40.288 --> 00:44:41.628
we create these illusions,

1327
00:44:41.628 --> 00:44:43.908
we make them have to be real,

1328
00:44:43.908 --> 00:44:45.028
and there are some people I'm sure

1329
00:44:45.028 --> 00:44:46.384
who are watching this program right now

1330
00:44:46.384 --> 00:44:48.436
are going "Oh no, but I had this experience,

1331
00:44:48.436 --> 00:44:50.036
"and it was real," and of course,

1332
00:44:50.036 --> 00:44:51.136
we know the old acronym.

1333
00:44:51.136 --> 00:44:53.652
Fear: False Evidence that Appears Real.

1334
00:44:53.652 --> 00:44:55.367
And they go, "Oh, but it definitely was real."

1335
00:44:55.367 --> 00:44:57.143
Of course, you have to think it was real,

1336
00:44:57.143 --> 00:44:59.103
otherwise, it would just be fur.

1337
00:44:59.103 --> 00:45:01.162
It has to appear real to us,

1338
00:45:01.162 --> 00:45:03.479
so we would carry that through,

1339
00:45:03.479 --> 00:45:06.980
and in our fear it drops our vibration,

1340
00:45:07.619 --> 00:45:10.726
so we are not vibrating at that level of light,

1341
00:45:10.726 --> 00:45:14.086
therefore, we're not able to be

1342
00:45:14.086 --> 00:45:16.126
the full reminder to the other person

1343
00:45:16.126 --> 00:45:17.784
to pick it up,

1344
00:45:17.784 --> 00:45:19.372
and in the process

1345
00:45:20.224 --> 00:45:22.464
we end up accepting things on

1346
00:45:22.464 --> 00:45:24.462
whether they're real,

1347
00:45:24.462 --> 00:45:26.262
or whether they're illusory,

1348
00:45:26.262 --> 00:45:28.848
and we have to bring ourselves back up to it.

1349
00:45:29.778 --> 00:45:31.998
The system that feeds into this

1350
00:45:31.998 --> 00:45:34.206
is that so much of it is based on

1351
00:45:34.958 --> 00:45:37.096
external validation.

1352
00:45:37.096 --> 00:45:39.844
We've either been working with

1353
00:45:40.536 --> 00:45:43.642
healing "techniques" which is not

1354
00:45:44.154 --> 00:45:46.252
the being of a full spectrum of healing,

1355
00:45:46.252 --> 00:45:48.392
but the little techniques that have

1356
00:45:48.392 --> 00:45:50.432
weaknesses and frailties, you know,

1357
00:45:50.432 --> 00:45:52.250
don't move more than three inches away

1358
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:54.108
because it gets weaker instead of stronger.

1359
00:45:54.108 --> 00:45:56.048
Take off your jewelry.

1360
00:45:56.048 --> 00:45:57.228
Oh, that's a good one.

1361
00:45:57.228 --> 00:45:58.008
Take off your jewelry,

1362
00:45:58.008 --> 00:45:59.926
especially those cell phone batteries

1363
00:45:59.926 --> 00:46:02.006
might be emitting certain waves

1364
00:46:02.006 --> 00:46:04.062
in that big, giant pendant, remove it,

1365
00:46:04.062 --> 00:46:05.222
and what are we thinking?

1366
00:46:05.222 --> 00:46:06.318
Could you imagine Mother-Father God is

1367
00:46:06.318 --> 00:46:07.758
floating around in a cloud

1368
00:46:07.758 --> 00:46:09.276
somewhere going,

1369
00:46:09.276 --> 00:46:10.888
"Gee, I'd really like that Scott to have a healing,

1370
00:46:10.888 --> 00:46:13.328
"but, tsk-tsk-tsk, that belt,

1371
00:46:14.376 --> 00:46:17.126
"can't get through it, spiritual kryptonite."

1372
00:46:18.036 --> 00:46:19.836
Are we really thinking?

1373
00:46:19.836 --> 00:46:21.496
Some of those techniques

1374
00:46:21.496 --> 00:46:23.432
because when we just worked with energy,

1375
00:46:23.432 --> 00:46:25.612
and energy fragments may have had

1376
00:46:25.612 --> 00:46:28.072
those frailties and weaknesses.

1377
00:46:28.072 --> 00:46:29.872
Some of it's our own perception.

1378
00:46:29.872 --> 00:46:32.112
The fact is when we open up,

1379
00:46:32.112 --> 00:46:34.430
and we bring through source,

1380
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:36.390
God, love, universe source, creator,

1381
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:37.850
whatever word you want to use.

1382
00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:39.888
Some intelligence has trees grow up,

1383
00:46:39.888 --> 00:46:40.766
and roots grow down,

1384
00:46:40.766 --> 00:46:42.306
whatever you want to name it

1385
00:46:42.306 --> 00:46:44.284
we bring that in,

1386
00:46:44.284 --> 00:46:46.932
nothing that's a part of us is a blockage anyway,

1387
00:46:47.584 --> 00:46:49.842
and we will vibrate at that level of light,

1388
00:46:49.842 --> 00:46:51.422
and they'll be nothing for anything

1389
00:46:51.422 --> 00:46:54.138
to take hold of us either.

1390
00:46:54.138 --> 00:46:56.118
If you're afraid to do something,

1391
00:46:56.118 --> 00:46:58.858
my suggestion is for God's sake do it,

1392
00:46:58.858 --> 00:47:01.600
you know, using some intelligence,

1393
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:03.710
you know, we speak about,

1394
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:05.470
"Oh, John Smith, is the bravest person

1395
00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:06.146
"I've ever known,

1396
00:47:06.146 --> 00:47:07.144
"he's not afraid to do anything."

1397
00:47:07.144 --> 00:47:09.204
Then he's not brave

1398
00:47:09.204 --> 00:47:10.264
because you're not brave

1399
00:47:10.264 --> 00:47:12.224
unless you're willing to do the things

1400
00:47:12.224 --> 00:47:14.324
that you are afraid of,

1401
00:47:14.324 --> 00:47:15.684
and so I tell people, I say,

1402
00:47:15.684 --> 00:47:17.080
"You know what,

1403
00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:19.060
"if you're afraid to do something, do it."

1404
00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:19.916
I don't mean if you're afraid to jump off

1405
00:47:19.916 --> 00:47:21.584
an 85 story building, don't do that,

1406
00:47:21.584 --> 00:47:22.624
but let's say you're going to

1407
00:47:22.624 --> 00:47:23.584
a healing seminar,

1408
00:47:23.584 --> 00:47:25.104
you're running out the door, and you go,

1409
00:47:25.104 --> 00:47:26.624
"Oh God, I'm wearing a black shirt.

1410
00:47:26.624 --> 00:47:27.744
"I should go upstairs and put on

1411
00:47:27.744 --> 00:47:28.644
"a healing color."

1412
00:47:28.644 --> 00:47:30.944
Go back up, but don't put on what

1413
00:47:30.944 --> 00:47:32.296
"you" consider a healing color.

1414
00:47:32.296 --> 00:47:33.412
Put on all black, and don't cheat.

1415
00:47:33.412 --> 00:47:35.164
Don't put on purple underwear

1416
00:47:35.164 --> 00:47:35.964
because the worse thing

1417
00:47:35.964 --> 00:47:37.830
could happen is you'll die,

1418
00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:39.604
and then you'll be all right anyhow,

1419
00:47:39.604 --> 00:47:40.804
but if you don't die you'll have

1420
00:47:40.804 --> 00:47:43.162
just walked through one conscious fear,

1421
00:47:43.162 --> 00:47:44.182
and when you see that fear

1422
00:47:44.182 --> 00:47:46.602
for the illusion that it is,

1423
00:47:46.602 --> 00:47:48.062
a thousand and one other fears

1424
00:47:48.062 --> 00:47:49.462
you're not even aware of carrying

1425
00:47:49.462 --> 00:47:50.742
will fall away with it.

1426
00:47:50.742 --> 00:47:53.782
Find one fear a week,

1427
00:47:53.782 --> 00:47:54.842
and walk through it.

1428
00:47:54.842 --> 00:47:55.582
Something little,

1429
00:47:55.582 --> 00:47:56.642
step on the crack in the sidewalk.

1430
00:47:56.642 --> 00:47:57.656
Your mother can't run that fast

1431
00:47:57.656 --> 00:47:59.176
with a broken back anyway.

1432
00:47:59.176 --> 00:48:00.556
See what happens by the end of the year

1433
00:48:00.556 --> 00:48:02.754
we'll have let go of over 52,000 fears.

1434
00:48:02.754 --> 00:48:03.794
They'll be nothing left of us,

1435
00:48:03.794 --> 00:48:06.662
but to be love and light.

1436
00:48:08.372 --> 00:48:09.812
<v Voiceover>Do you mind,</v>

1437
00:48:09.812 --> 00:48:11.790
would this be an appropriate time for you

1438
00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:13.484
to share the six phrases

1439
00:48:13.484 --> 00:48:15.792
because, clearly, some beings

1440
00:48:17.122 --> 00:48:19.142
were trying to get through to you,

1441
00:48:19.142 --> 00:48:20.642
and they were knocking on your door,

1442
00:48:20.642 --> 00:48:21.580
and they finally came through

1443
00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:23.040
your unsuspecting clients,

1444
00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:25.608
and told you the same things over and over.

1445
00:48:26.598 --> 00:48:28.338
I found them interesting,

1446
00:48:28.338 --> 00:48:29.558
so if you wouldn't mind sharing.

1447
00:48:29.558 --> 00:48:31.066
<v ->No, absolutely not.</v>

1448
00:48:33.156 --> 00:48:34.876
The understanding of this is that

1449
00:48:34.876 --> 00:48:37.078
one patient who had been a patient of mine

1450
00:48:37.078 --> 00:48:40.026
for a year and-a-half came in.

1451
00:48:40.656 --> 00:48:42.216
I adjusted him, I told him to close his eyes

1452
00:48:42.216 --> 00:48:43.844
as I had been doing.

1453
00:48:44.734 --> 00:48:46.482
I held my hands by him.

1454
00:48:47.492 --> 00:48:48.872
His mouth began to move.

1455
00:48:48.872 --> 00:48:49.932
His eyes rolled back.

1456
00:48:49.932 --> 00:48:50.932
His tongue moved in a fashion

1457
00:48:50.932 --> 00:48:52.372
that was clearly forming vowels.

1458
00:48:52.372 --> 00:48:53.992
Air came out of his mouth,

1459
00:48:53.992 --> 00:48:55.952
and then condensed itself into

1460
00:48:55.952 --> 00:48:58.952
a very strong, authoritative voice that said,

1461
00:48:58.952 --> 00:49:01.592
"We are here to tell you

1462
00:49:01.592 --> 00:49:04.180
"to continue doing what you are doing.

1463
00:49:05.032 --> 00:49:07.430
"What you are doing is bringing light,

1464
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:10.048
"and information onto the planet,"

1465
00:49:10.048 --> 00:49:11.546
and he said a few other things,

1466
00:49:11.546 --> 00:49:13.502
and then I had to stop

1467
00:49:13.502 --> 00:49:15.668
because I had all my patients waiting for me.

1468
00:49:19.316 --> 00:49:21.716
He explained to me.

1469
00:49:21.716 --> 00:49:24.036
At first he begged to not have him

1470
00:49:24.036 --> 00:49:25.676
carted off to a mental hospital

1471
00:49:25.676 --> 00:49:27.350
when I explained to him that I mean

1472
00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:28.510
I had never seen this before,

1473
00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:30.130
but I had heard of the concept of

1474
00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:32.010
either call it speaking in tongues,

1475
00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:33.148
except the tongue was English,

1476
00:49:33.148 --> 00:49:34.428
or you could call it channeling,

1477
00:49:34.428 --> 00:49:35.748
and the people who call it speaking in tongues

1478
00:49:35.748 --> 00:49:36.668
won't speak to the people

1479
00:49:36.668 --> 00:49:37.548
who call it channeling,

1480
00:49:37.548 --> 00:49:39.068
but that's another thing.

1481
00:49:39.068 --> 00:49:40.914
I've heard of it and it was fascinating.

1482
00:49:41.684 --> 00:49:43.672
He said he had been doing it.

1483
00:49:44.483 --> 00:49:45.682
It had started coming through him

1484
00:49:45.682 --> 00:49:46.902
when he was around 11 or 12,

1485
00:49:46.902 --> 00:49:49.209
and I think he was about in his mid 40's then.

1486
00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:52.235
I thought, "All right, well, it's interesting."

1487
00:49:53.451 --> 00:49:55.027
I didn't give it a lot, a lot of thought

1488
00:49:55.027 --> 00:49:56.883
right at that moment until two days later

1489
00:49:56.883 --> 00:49:59.795
when it happened with three other people

1490
00:49:59.795 --> 00:50:01.795
who had not ever had

1491
00:50:01.795 --> 00:50:03.361
that experience before.

1492
00:50:04.195 --> 00:50:05.963
They said the same two phrases.

1493
00:50:05.963 --> 00:50:06.963
"We're here to tell you

1494
00:50:06.963 --> 00:50:09.159
"to continue doing what you are doing.

1495
00:50:09.159 --> 00:50:11.039
"What you are doing is bringing light,

1496
00:50:11.039 --> 00:50:13.027
"and information onto the planet."

1497
00:50:13.917 --> 00:50:15.917
Then two of them added,

1498
00:50:15.917 --> 00:50:19.907
"What you're doing is reconnecting strands,"

1499
00:50:21.357 --> 00:50:24.435
which I know from a large part of the story

1500
00:50:24.435 --> 00:50:25.555
that we haven't had time,

1501
00:50:25.555 --> 00:50:26.307
and I don't think be able

1502
00:50:26.307 --> 00:50:27.925
to touch on this in this interview,

1503
00:50:27.925 --> 00:50:29.913
this time anyway,

1504
00:50:29.913 --> 00:50:32.051
meant DNA strands.

1505
00:50:32.051 --> 00:50:33.351
One of them said,

1506
00:50:33.351 --> 00:50:35.661
"What you're doing is reconnecting strings."

1507
00:50:38.631 --> 00:50:40.411
Fred, the first person came back in

1508
00:50:40.411 --> 00:50:41.571
the end of that week,

1509
00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:43.031
and was doing automatic writing

1510
00:50:43.031 --> 00:50:44.631
which was a Fred thing, he had done that.

1511
00:50:44.631 --> 00:50:46.051
The other three hadn't, but he had,

1512
00:50:46.051 --> 00:50:47.971
and he wrote as his last sentence,

1513
00:50:47.971 --> 00:50:50.241
"What you're doing is reconnecting strings."

1514
00:50:51.451 --> 00:50:54.351
I thought these were only three phrases

1515
00:50:55.687 --> 00:50:57.227
because in my understanding

1516
00:50:57.227 --> 00:50:58.895
of this experience

1517
00:51:02.065 --> 00:51:04.185
there was this intelligence out there

1518
00:51:04.185 --> 00:51:05.831
somewhere in the universe

1519
00:51:07.561 --> 00:51:09.749
that was communicating

1520
00:51:10.441 --> 00:51:11.619
through my patients

1521
00:51:11.619 --> 00:51:14.939
using them as if they were a radio receiver,

1522
00:51:14.939 --> 00:51:17.679
as if the intelligence was the radio station

1523
00:51:17.679 --> 00:51:19.439
broadcasting the message,

1524
00:51:19.439 --> 00:51:20.599
and it really didn't matter whether

1525
00:51:20.599 --> 00:51:21.837
it was this radio, that radio,

1526
00:51:21.837 --> 00:51:23.037
or the other radio

1527
00:51:23.037 --> 00:51:24.517
because, I mean, the moment

1528
00:51:24.517 --> 00:51:26.117
I brought my hands near these people

1529
00:51:26.117 --> 00:51:27.335
who had never in their lives

1530
00:51:27.335 --> 00:51:29.567
brought through a voice.

1531
00:51:29.567 --> 00:51:32.567
Their voice, their vocal cords came out.

1532
00:51:32.567 --> 00:51:33.987
You could tape record it,

1533
00:51:33.987 --> 00:51:35.747
you could witness it, I mean,

1534
00:51:35.747 --> 00:51:37.847
and spoke these words,

1535
00:51:37.847 --> 00:51:38.727
so my thoughts were,

1536
00:51:38.727 --> 00:51:40.787
"Well, here's this universal intelligence

1537
00:51:40.787 --> 00:51:42.067
"ringing through this message,

1538
00:51:42.067 --> 00:51:44.547
"but having to be limited in its scope

1539
00:51:44.547 --> 00:51:47.407
"of communication by utilizing our

1540
00:51:47.407 --> 00:51:50.587
"three/four-dimensional English language."

1541
00:51:50.587 --> 00:51:53.667
So strings and strands sort of sound alike.

1542
00:51:53.667 --> 00:51:55.427
They give a similar little vision,

1543
00:51:55.427 --> 00:51:57.427
and a little feel, a little word sound.

1544
00:51:57.427 --> 00:51:58.407
I thought it was the same thing.

1545
00:51:58.407 --> 00:52:00.293
It was at least,

1546
00:52:02.123 --> 00:52:04.623
it was at least four years I will say

1547
00:52:04.623 --> 00:52:06.779
before someone said to me in a conversation,

1548
00:52:06.779 --> 00:52:07.659
"Well, haven't you ever heard

1549
00:52:07.659 --> 00:52:09.375
"about string theory?"

1550
00:52:09.375 --> 00:52:11.295
And I said, "What's that?"

1551
00:52:11.295 --> 00:52:13.455
And they explained string theory in basics

1552
00:52:13.455 --> 00:52:15.235
just small enough for this conversation

1553
00:52:15.235 --> 00:52:18.195
meaning simultaneous planes of existence.

1554
00:52:18.195 --> 00:52:20.135
You and I are here having this interview.

1555
00:52:20.135 --> 00:52:22.535
Something else is going on in here.

1556
00:52:22.535 --> 00:52:24.975
Lord knows it is right here in Sedona

1557
00:52:24.975 --> 00:52:25.915
at this very same time

1558
00:52:25.915 --> 00:52:27.375
we don't see them, they don't see us,

1559
00:52:27.375 --> 00:52:28.495
but something might be occurring,

1560
00:52:28.495 --> 00:52:29.153
and we don't see them,

1561
00:52:29.153 --> 00:52:31.579
and they do see us, and I'm thinking,

1562
00:52:32.329 --> 00:52:34.709
"Could anything make much more sense?"

1563
00:52:34.709 --> 00:52:36.589
Because who was it?

1564
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:38.427
Someone had to know

1565
00:52:39.165 --> 00:52:41.007
that at that moment

1566
00:52:41.945 --> 00:52:43.377
this person would be

1567
00:52:43.377 --> 00:52:44.933
lying down on my table.

1568
00:52:44.933 --> 00:52:46.553
I would be in that room.

1569
00:52:46.553 --> 00:52:47.813
It wasn't five minutes earlier

1570
00:52:47.813 --> 00:52:49.273
when I was in another room.

1571
00:52:49.273 --> 00:52:50.553
It wasn't in the middle of the night

1572
00:52:50.553 --> 00:52:52.613
when I was across town in the supermarket.

1573
00:52:52.613 --> 00:52:55.873
It was then at that moment

1574
00:52:55.873 --> 00:52:57.785
to broadcast that message

1575
00:52:57.785 --> 00:52:59.623
in audible form right through us.

1576
00:53:00.345 --> 00:53:02.353
Who was it becomes the question,

1577
00:53:02.353 --> 00:53:03.753
and everyone has an interesting

1578
00:53:03.753 --> 00:53:05.173
kind of an answer,

1579
00:53:05.173 --> 00:53:07.315
but it's always an answer that tends to separate.

1580
00:53:08.053 --> 00:53:09.617
It was this guide, it was those guides,

1581
00:53:09.617 --> 00:53:10.817
it was these angels,

1582
00:53:10.817 --> 00:53:12.671
it was this person watching over.

1583
00:53:14.809 --> 00:53:16.459
It was us.

1584
00:53:17.069 --> 00:53:19.689
I don't mean necessarily,

1585
00:53:19.689 --> 00:53:21.661
and maybe yes,

1586
00:53:21.661 --> 00:53:23.661
us as who we are,

1587
00:53:23.661 --> 00:53:27.091
but I'm speaking if it was us as humanity.

1588
00:53:28.521 --> 00:53:30.381
See I feel that reconnective healing

1589
00:53:30.381 --> 00:53:33.141
is not so much about healing

1590
00:53:33.141 --> 00:53:34.581
as we speak about it,

1591
00:53:34.581 --> 00:53:37.701
but it's our evolution

1592
00:53:37.701 --> 00:53:40.809
in new or fifth dimensional existence.

1593
00:53:40.809 --> 00:53:42.249
<v Voiceover>Which does create</v>

1594
00:53:42.249 --> 00:53:44.069
changes in the DNA,

1595
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:45.509
and that's the part of the story

1596
00:53:45.509 --> 00:53:46.849
that's a big part

1597
00:53:46.849 --> 00:53:48.829
that we can't do in this interview.

1598
00:53:48.829 --> 00:53:49.409
<v ->Right.</v>

1599
00:53:49.409 --> 00:53:50.349
<v Voiceover>But we will pick that up.</v>

1600
00:53:50.349 --> 00:53:52.669
<v ->And/or the other way around,</v>

1601
00:53:52.669 --> 00:53:55.009
but just to condense this

1602
00:53:55.009 --> 00:53:57.489
the fact is the DNA is changing,

1603
00:53:57.489 --> 00:53:59.829
and how that can play is if we simply think of

1604
00:53:59.829 --> 00:54:01.989
we only use less than 10% of our brain

1605
00:54:01.989 --> 00:54:03.509
according to most people.

1606
00:54:03.509 --> 00:54:05.327
What do we think of our brain as hardware?

1607
00:54:05.929 --> 00:54:08.291
What do we think of our DNA software?

1608
00:54:09.021 --> 00:54:10.801
What if we're restructuring the DNA.

1609
00:54:10.801 --> 00:54:12.241
It's like putting a new software program

1610
00:54:12.241 --> 00:54:14.241
into our computer and we get more out of it,

1611
00:54:14.241 --> 00:54:17.073
and that is probably what's opening us up

1612
00:54:17.073 --> 00:54:18.721
to be able now to communicate with

1613
00:54:18.721 --> 00:54:20.571
the next level of human evolution.

1614
00:54:23.441 --> 00:54:25.441
<v ->If you're interested in the multi-dimensional</v>

1615
00:54:25.441 --> 00:54:27.201
aspects of this healing,

1616
00:54:27.201 --> 00:54:29.201
you might also enjoy our interviews with

1617
00:54:29.201 --> 00:54:31.441
Vernon Woolf and Mitchell Gibson

1618
00:54:31.441 --> 00:54:33.641
who also speak about living and healing

1619
00:54:33.641 --> 00:54:36.057
within our multi-dimensional universe.

1620
00:54:36.057 --> 00:54:38.197
Until next time, thanks for watching.

1621
00:54:38.197 --> 00:54:43.187
(upbeat music)
