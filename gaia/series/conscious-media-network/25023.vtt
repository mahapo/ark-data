00:00:00.955 --> 00:00:05.701
(intospective piano music)

2
00:00:12.532 --> 00:00:15.967
<v ->Barbara Marx Hubbard refers to herself as an evolutionary.</v>

3
00:00:15.967 --> 00:00:17.768
Born with a curious mind,

4
00:00:17.768 --> 00:00:20.071
asking even more curious questions,

5
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:23.194
it was not until Barbara was finished with her child rearing

6
00:00:23.194 --> 00:00:24.675
that she expressed her own voice

7
00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:26.879
in the form of conscious evolution.

8
00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:29.087
Her most recent expression is a film titled

9
00:00:29.087 --> 00:00:31.416
Visions of a Universal Humanity.

10
00:00:31.416 --> 00:00:34.486
In our conversation we spoke of the future of humankind

11
00:00:34.486 --> 00:00:37.288
being dependent upon women waking to their purpose,

12
00:00:37.288 --> 00:00:40.761
which will necessitate a new kind of partnership.

13
00:00:41.948 --> 00:00:46.724 line:15% 
(introspective piano and violin music)

14
00:00:49.101 --> 00:00:50.869
<v Regina>Barbara, we finally meet again</v>

15
00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:53.371
after five or six years, I last saw you in Sedona

16
00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:56.341
and you and I have both just emerged from

17
00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:58.843
a very interesting experience,

18
00:00:58.843 --> 00:01:02.478
a shamanic journey into the future

19
00:01:02.478 --> 00:01:04.358
led by Llyn Roberts.

20
00:01:04.358 --> 00:01:06.152
And this has just happened moments ago

21
00:01:06.152 --> 00:01:08.720
and you had a really profound experience there

22
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.522
and we thought we'd just go ahead and catch it right now

23
00:01:10.522 --> 00:01:13.758
before we begin the rest of the talk.

24
00:01:13.758 --> 00:01:17.828
<v ->Well you know, it was from John Perkins' talk,</v>

25
00:01:17.828 --> 00:01:20.131
before Llyn, when he was talking about

26
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:23.001
being an economic hitman at the same time

27
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:26.558
a shamanic being--
<v Regina>Yes, fascinating.</v>

28
00:01:26.558 --> 00:01:28.339
<v Barbara>And how those two came together</v>

29
00:01:28.339 --> 00:01:30.442
in him in that moment.

30
00:01:30.442 --> 00:01:33.053
And they did this very powerful

31
00:01:33.053 --> 00:01:36.359
request for us to go into

32
00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:37.949
50 or 60 years from now,

33
00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:41.920
but going into our sacred space first.

34
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.155
And I went into my sacred space.

35
00:01:44.155 --> 00:01:47.390
And my sacred space is really

36
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.670
a communication hub.

37
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.428
<v Regina>Yes!</v>

38
00:01:50.428 --> 00:01:52.964
<v ->And I know exactly what it is.</v>

39
00:01:52.964 --> 00:01:55.867
If you can visualize a spiral of evolution,

40
00:01:55.867 --> 00:01:57.868
and it goes right up to the present,

41
00:01:57.868 --> 00:02:01.409
this hub is at the current center

42
00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.199
of our turn on the spiral.

43
00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:07.412
It is informed in a sacred way with the inner impulse

44
00:02:07.412 --> 00:02:10.015
of creation that goes through each of us.

45
00:02:10.015 --> 00:02:14.451
And it's a communication hub from that sacred space

46
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:18.890
and it has screens of everything that's working.

47
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.727
They could be on internet now, but you can click on it

48
00:02:22.727 --> 00:02:25.430
and you will see, it's a round room

49
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.399
that is filled with the screens of what's emergent

50
00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:30.702
in health, education, economics.

51
00:02:30.702 --> 00:02:32.938
But it's not just projects.

52
00:02:32.938 --> 00:02:34.739
It's a feeling of sacred space,

53
00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.107
it's already being connected.

54
00:02:37.107 --> 00:02:38.910
And part of the reason it's being connected,

55
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.284
it's the way evolution connects to make whole systems.

56
00:02:43.284 --> 00:02:43.748
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

57
00:02:43.748 --> 00:02:45.583
<v ->Well the very high intelligence has coordinated</v>

58
00:02:45.583 --> 00:02:48.426
the entire universe.

59
00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:50.722
Each of us is 50 trillion cells.

60
00:02:50.722 --> 00:02:52.057
Coordinated!

61
00:02:52.057 --> 00:02:53.692
The planet earth is a living system,

62
00:02:53.692 --> 00:02:56.868
it's coordinated but the function, the mission,

63
00:02:56.868 --> 00:03:00.732
that I am called to is a mission of being

64
00:03:00.732 --> 00:03:03.784
in a coordinating communication hub.

65
00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:06.070
Because it's like the planetary body

66
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.140
needs to have an experience of its own synthesis.

67
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.707
It's not just random activities.

68
00:03:12.707 --> 00:03:16.215
And it needs to have a coherent

69
00:03:16.215 --> 00:03:18.065
microcosm of itself.

70
00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:20.085
And I'm in a communication hub,

71
00:03:20.085 --> 00:03:23.321
and Sidney is next to me, he's my ancient partner,

72
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:25.056
he's like ancient of days.

73
00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:27.959
He's sitting there and we're like some of those pictures

74
00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.196
of those elderly couples. (laughs)

75
00:03:31.196 --> 00:03:34.898
But I'm sort of straight as, like...

76
00:03:34.898 --> 00:03:36.568
Some of those portraits I think,

77
00:03:36.568 --> 00:03:38.413
trying to remember the artist.

78
00:03:38.413 --> 00:03:41.372
With the old-fashioned women of the West when they're--

79
00:03:41.372 --> 00:03:42.279
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

80
00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:45.885
<v ->They're sitting absolutely straight</v>

81
00:03:45.885 --> 00:03:47.378
and Sidney right next to me.

82
00:03:47.378 --> 00:03:48.980
But we're surrounded with this,

83
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.982
it's a very creative media hub.

84
00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:56.721
And as we approach the 2012 experience,

85
00:03:56.721 --> 00:03:59.658
this hub is functioning.

86
00:03:59.658 --> 00:04:02.861
And it's communicating and it's synthesizing,

87
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:06.818
and because of the synergy that it's evoking

88
00:04:07.688 --> 00:04:10.882
throughout the world,

89
00:04:10.882 --> 00:04:15.139
the receptivity of humanity to its own oneness

90
00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.832
is being facilitated,

91
00:04:17.832 --> 00:04:20.512
is being nurtured by this hub.

92
00:04:20.512 --> 00:04:24.749
And as this deep experience of resonance

93
00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:27.419
is communicated out and everything that's working

94
00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.721
is there and you can know it and you can activate it,

95
00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:34.793
the light starts to come from within humanity.

96
00:04:34.793 --> 00:04:36.227
And it's a mystic light,

97
00:04:36.227 --> 00:04:38.262
it's the light that all mystics have seen.

98
00:04:38.262 --> 00:04:39.775
But we become resonant

99
00:04:39.775 --> 00:04:43.535
and we lose our self-conscious separation.

100
00:04:43.535 --> 00:04:46.972
And then we projected 50 to 60 years in the future

101
00:04:46.972 --> 00:04:51.571
with this vision and what I saw was that enough,

102
00:04:51.571 --> 00:04:52.643
that only the people

103
00:04:52.643 --> 00:04:55.780
whose consciousness could have shifted were there!

104
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.981
<v Regina>Exactly, yes.</v>

105
00:04:56.981 --> 00:05:01.052
<v ->And the ones whose consciousness was feeling separate,</v>

106
00:05:01.052 --> 00:05:02.788
were not there.

107
00:05:02.788 --> 00:05:06.624
And because the people whose consciousness

108
00:05:06.624 --> 00:05:09.227
was already there,

109
00:05:09.227 --> 00:05:12.430
the light was being not only lifted among us

110
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.300
but up from us and the light from the beings,

111
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.104
I would call them universal beings already there

112
00:05:19.104 --> 00:05:23.492
in the billions of other planetary systems and galaxies,

113
00:05:24.402 --> 00:05:28.113
and that light between what was coming down to us

114
00:05:28.113 --> 00:05:30.482
and what was coming up through us

115
00:05:30.482 --> 00:05:33.884
was shifting the field of earth so radically

116
00:05:33.884 --> 00:05:37.755
that the 50 to 60 years from now

117
00:05:37.755 --> 00:05:41.859
was not actually imaginable of trying to get

118
00:05:41.859 --> 00:05:44.162
us together in our current state of consciousness.

119
00:05:44.162 --> 00:05:46.130
<v Regina>Yes, I understand what you're saying.</v>

120
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.666
And it's such a different paradigm

121
00:05:47.666 --> 00:05:49.667
that has been created by them.

122
00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:52.309
<v ->It's so different because,</v>

123
00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:54.638
50 to 60 years I will no longer be here

124
00:05:54.638 --> 00:05:56.040
in this physical form.

125
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.015
Most of us who are certainly of the age,

126
00:05:59.015 --> 00:06:01.679
of middle age, probably will not be here.

127
00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:04.916
But the only ones that somehow have made it through

128
00:06:04.916 --> 00:06:09.683
are in a state of whole system, universal consciousness.

129
00:06:09.683 --> 00:06:10.917
<v Regina>Yes!</v>

130
00:06:10.917 --> 00:06:12.289
It's interesting you say that,

131
00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.058
because when I went into the same journey

132
00:06:14.058 --> 00:06:17.896
I was in a little space, it was a beautiful, natural space,

133
00:06:17.896 --> 00:06:19.564
but it was an information hub also

134
00:06:19.564 --> 00:06:21.999
and I was watching screens and--

135
00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:23.154
(laughing)

136
00:06:23.154 --> 00:06:24.682
<v ->Maybe it was the same space! (laughs)</v>

137
00:06:24.682 --> 00:06:26.770
<v Regina>We may have been hooked up already!</v>

138
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.006
I was watching the same thing

139
00:06:28.006 --> 00:06:31.810
and this incredible sense of absolute inter-connectedness

140
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.314
with all beings, everything, all information available,

141
00:06:36.314 --> 00:06:38.449
literally almost as fast as your thought

142
00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:39.791
could conceive of what you needed

143
00:06:39.791 --> 00:06:41.652
to connect, if you were connected.

144
00:06:41.652 --> 00:06:44.121
Also, there were other off-planet species,

145
00:06:44.121 --> 00:06:45.290
whatever you like to call them,

146
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.159
we had already integrated other cultures

147
00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:51.885
in with ours and were using the best of the most

148
00:06:51.885 --> 00:06:56.534
super, very quiet, clean, efficient technologies

149
00:06:56.534 --> 00:06:57.802
that allowed you to be anywhere,

150
00:06:57.802 --> 00:06:59.617
because they weren't grid tied anymore.

151
00:06:59.617 --> 00:07:01.005
But it was a sense of connection

152
00:07:01.005 --> 00:07:03.474
and people living in areas of the earth

153
00:07:03.474 --> 00:07:05.543
where the herbs and the food supplies

154
00:07:05.543 --> 00:07:09.147
actually were compatible with their own system and blood.

155
00:07:09.147 --> 00:07:10.748
And people understood these things

156
00:07:10.748 --> 00:07:13.151
and would be where nature was supporting

157
00:07:13.151 --> 00:07:16.957
their physical health and well being and expansion.

158
00:07:16.957 --> 00:07:19.056
It was very beautiful but it was exactly what you did,

159
00:07:19.056 --> 00:07:22.359
just right there in this incredible hub of information

160
00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:24.161
looking at screens.

161
00:07:24.161 --> 00:07:25.264
<v ->Isn't that funny?</v>

162
00:07:25.264 --> 00:07:27.265
I believe it's a social pattern.

163
00:07:27.265 --> 00:07:27.999
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

164
00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:30.535
<v ->That's not even an original idea,</v>

165
00:07:30.535 --> 00:07:31.870
it's a social archetype.

166
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.060
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

167
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.308
<v ->They're archetypal in human individual consciousness.</v>

168
00:07:37.308 --> 00:07:39.343
There are social archetypes.

169
00:07:39.343 --> 00:07:43.181
And this is an emergent social archetype of social synergy,

170
00:07:43.181 --> 00:07:45.816
social connectivity, and it's necessary

171
00:07:45.816 --> 00:07:48.686
for the planetary organism to awaken

172
00:07:48.686 --> 00:07:50.455
to its own potential.

173
00:07:50.455 --> 00:07:52.824
And I've known that all along

174
00:07:52.824 --> 00:07:56.120
and have had a mission of at least expressing it.

175
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:56.727
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

176
00:07:56.727 --> 00:08:00.431
<v ->But the amazing thing now is we can do it.</v>

177
00:08:00.431 --> 00:08:03.333
And I have in my home, in Santa Barbara, California,

178
00:08:03.333 --> 00:08:07.571
a little tiny inner-monastery for conscious evolution.

179
00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:10.407
It has a graphic of the wheel and the spiral,

180
00:08:10.407 --> 00:08:12.944
and we do evolutionary communion in there,

181
00:08:12.944 --> 00:08:15.480
where we imagine the whole story of the universe,

182
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.945
it comes up right through us and we feel

183
00:08:18.945 --> 00:08:22.857
our own expression joined

184
00:08:22.857 --> 00:08:25.489
with the core of the spiral and each other,

185
00:08:25.489 --> 00:08:28.726
and then we move out into our social functions.

186
00:08:28.726 --> 00:08:30.934
But we never leave the core.

187
00:08:30.934 --> 00:08:31.429
<v Regina>Right.</v>

188
00:08:31.429 --> 00:08:33.332
<v ->And we're in a global communion</v>

189
00:08:33.332 --> 00:08:36.133
of pioneering souls right now.

190
00:08:36.133 --> 00:08:38.396
There are enough people on earth

191
00:08:38.396 --> 00:08:41.639
whose consciousness is already shifting.

192
00:08:41.639 --> 00:08:45.533
But the connectivity of those people

193
00:08:45.533 --> 00:08:49.047
needs this function right now

194
00:08:49.047 --> 00:08:51.349
in order to facilitate the natural.

195
00:08:51.349 --> 00:08:55.352
It's like a baby just being born needs a signal,

196
00:08:55.352 --> 00:08:58.679
it's being born, so breathe! (inhales deeply)

197
00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:02.160
You know the breathing together of an individual newborn

198
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.561
is quite complex.

199
00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:06.663
And if it doesn't (claps) breathe, it has to get spanked,

200
00:09:06.663 --> 00:09:08.166
or it turns blue.

201
00:09:08.166 --> 00:09:11.742
It's like if we don't coordinate our breath right now,

202
00:09:11.742 --> 00:09:14.038
it's more and more painful.

203
00:09:14.038 --> 00:09:16.474
So, that was my experience and it's amazing

204
00:09:16.474 --> 00:09:19.511
that I should just have come for this interview.

205
00:09:19.511 --> 00:09:21.145
<v Regina>It is, cuz that was for,</v>

206
00:09:21.145 --> 00:09:23.614
I was still a little dozy and that was on my mind

207
00:09:23.614 --> 00:09:25.782
when you and I sat down here a few minutes ago,

208
00:09:25.782 --> 00:09:28.252
I was still thinking of my own experience as well.

209
00:09:28.252 --> 00:09:32.372
<v ->So, I walked down the stairs and said to my friend Judith,</v>

210
00:09:32.372 --> 00:09:34.659
"I know why I'm on this interview now."

211
00:09:34.659 --> 00:09:38.158
Because I've noticed an absolute synchronicity of timing.

212
00:09:38.158 --> 00:09:38.863
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

213
00:09:38.863 --> 00:09:40.865
<v ->Like there's no time between events</v>

214
00:09:40.865 --> 00:09:43.101
to think of what's gonna happen.

215
00:09:43.101 --> 00:09:44.836
You just come right in, say it

216
00:09:44.836 --> 00:09:47.397
and whatever's s'posed to happen, will happen.

217
00:09:47.397 --> 00:09:50.060
And that's the way I felt about sitting here with you.

218
00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.162
<v Regina>Well, it couldn't be more true.</v>

219
00:09:52.162 --> 00:09:56.883
And I think, I guess there is no surprise in any of it.

220
00:09:56.883 --> 00:09:58.749
What I'd like to do, if you don't mind,

221
00:09:58.749 --> 00:10:01.152
after this fresh experience,

222
00:10:01.152 --> 00:10:03.421
I don't want to take you back in time at all but,

223
00:10:03.421 --> 00:10:07.687
to go back a little bit into some of your own

224
00:10:07.687 --> 00:10:10.094
earlier life thinking

225
00:10:10.094 --> 00:10:12.029
that took you to where you are right now.

226
00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:13.397
And I'm gonna talk to you about a couple things

227
00:10:13.397 --> 00:10:15.299
because a couple things really touched my heart,

228
00:10:15.299 --> 00:10:18.008
such as Auroville, which is one of my favorite,

229
00:10:18.008 --> 00:10:20.571
the Matrimandir space is probably

230
00:10:20.571 --> 00:10:24.227
the most profound meditation place I've ever been, indoors.

231
00:10:24.227 --> 00:10:26.077
Something was given birth to there.

232
00:10:26.077 --> 00:10:28.012
And these birthing points along the way,

233
00:10:28.012 --> 00:10:30.080
that's what I'd like to talk to you about.

234
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.950
Your journey, your birthing points of consciousness,

235
00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:34.318
and now how it's interfacing

236
00:10:34.318 --> 00:10:36.687
with what you're trying to give birth to in the world.

237
00:10:36.687 --> 00:10:39.729
And also, the woman's journey within this.

238
00:10:39.729 --> 00:10:41.598
<v ->So important.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

239
00:10:41.598 --> 00:10:43.419
<v Barbara>So, important.</v>

240
00:10:43.419 --> 00:10:44.962
<v Regina>Where would you like to begin with this?</v>

241
00:10:44.962 --> 00:10:47.798
We don't wanna be superfluous on anything, let's just--

242
00:10:47.798 --> 00:10:50.319
<v ->No, well you know somewhat,</v>

243
00:10:50.319 --> 00:10:51.775
as I said in my talk today,

244
00:10:51.775 --> 00:10:54.404
I think the trigger for me was when

245
00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:57.751
the United States dropped the atomic bombs on Japan.

246
00:10:57.751 --> 00:10:59.660
Because I had been a happy child.

247
00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:00.751
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

248
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:03.482
<v ->And I was 15 and it suddenly occurred to me</v>

249
00:11:03.482 --> 00:11:05.349
that if we keep on going in this direction

250
00:11:05.349 --> 00:11:07.285
we could destroy everything.

251
00:11:07.285 --> 00:11:10.188
But I thought that we were good.

252
00:11:10.188 --> 00:11:11.722
I thought the Americans were good.

253
00:11:11.722 --> 00:11:13.958
I thought, you know, humans were good.

254
00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:17.939
So I wondered, is there a meaning of all this new power

255
00:11:17.939 --> 00:11:20.331
that science and technology mainly has given us,

256
00:11:20.331 --> 00:11:21.848
that's good?

257
00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:23.928
That could be leading to a future we want?

258
00:11:23.928 --> 00:11:26.504
So, I started to look into it.

259
00:11:26.504 --> 00:11:28.844
And I won't go into the time it took me,

260
00:11:28.844 --> 00:11:30.742
but I tried to join the church,

261
00:11:30.742 --> 00:11:32.610
the Episcopal Church in Scarsdale,

262
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.544
to say is any of this true?

263
00:11:34.544 --> 00:11:35.913
No, they didn't know.

264
00:11:35.913 --> 00:11:38.048
Then I tried it at Bryn Mawr College.

265
00:11:38.048 --> 00:11:40.417
Can you ask a question, the future of humanity,

266
00:11:40.417 --> 00:11:43.360
where are we going, what is each of our vocation?

267
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.922
Couldn't ask the question

268
00:11:44.922 --> 00:11:47.291
because all the disciplines are separate.

269
00:11:47.291 --> 00:11:50.227
Then I met President Eisenhower through my father.

270
00:11:50.227 --> 00:11:53.063
1952, go into the Oval Office.

271
00:11:53.063 --> 00:11:55.459
Mr. President I have a question for you.

272
00:11:55.459 --> 00:11:56.733
Yes, young lady?

273
00:11:56.733 --> 00:11:58.836
I'd like to know, do you know the meaning

274
00:11:58.836 --> 00:12:01.271
of our new power, that's good?

275
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:04.571
Where is the United States going with this power?

276
00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:07.310
It was after the atomic bomb.

277
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:11.815
It was just at the beginning of this huge sense

278
00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:13.918
of our own power.

279
00:12:13.918 --> 00:12:17.221
But I could tell that it could destroy us

280
00:12:17.221 --> 00:12:19.557
and I thought the President might know.

281
00:12:19.557 --> 00:12:22.896
Of course he had no, he said "I have no idea."

282
00:12:22.896 --> 00:12:25.629
So then, I married an artist and I think

283
00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:28.499
my first shift point was when Earl,

284
00:12:28.499 --> 00:12:32.403
my husband that I'd married, said to me

285
00:12:32.403 --> 00:12:35.673
"Until the artist knows the new story,

286
00:12:35.673 --> 00:12:38.742
"And can see an image of humans commensurate

287
00:12:38.742 --> 00:12:41.312
"With our power to shape the future,

288
00:12:41.312 --> 00:12:42.913
"We won't be able to do it."

289
00:12:42.913 --> 00:12:45.165
<v Regina>No wonder you married him.</v>

290
00:12:45.165 --> 00:12:47.064
<v ->I thought, I'm gonna marry him,</v>

291
00:12:47.064 --> 00:12:48.383
it was in my junior year abroad--

292
00:12:48.383 --> 00:12:49.818
<v Regina>That's amazing!</v>
<v Barbara>And I did.</v>

293
00:12:49.818 --> 00:12:52.059
<v Regina>What an amazingly profound statement</v>

294
00:12:52.059 --> 00:12:53.591
for what you were looking for.

295
00:12:53.591 --> 00:12:55.258
Two souls waiting to connect.

296
00:12:55.258 --> 00:12:56.527
<v ->So here's something just to note,</v>

297
00:12:56.527 --> 00:12:58.230
if you have a sense of mission

298
00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:01.482
that's very deep inside you, notice.

299
00:13:01.482 --> 00:13:02.212
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

300
00:13:02.212 --> 00:13:03.834
<v ->If you're getting a signal of somebody</v>

301
00:13:03.834 --> 00:13:05.269
that is part of that mission

302
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:07.171
and you're part of that person's mission.

303
00:13:07.171 --> 00:13:09.273
Because in order to evolve these days

304
00:13:09.273 --> 00:13:12.843
you actually have to have very specific partnerships.

305
00:13:12.843 --> 00:13:13.743
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

306
00:13:13.743 --> 00:13:16.647
<v ->It is not just random networking anymore,</v>

307
00:13:16.647 --> 00:13:18.316
cuz we're in metamorphosis.

308
00:13:18.316 --> 00:13:20.184
But I didn't know that then.

309
00:13:20.184 --> 00:13:22.752
So, when we got married,

310
00:13:22.752 --> 00:13:24.721
I had five children.

311
00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:26.723
Lost the question for some time.

312
00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:28.659
Got depressed.

313
00:13:28.659 --> 00:13:32.560
Began to think that there was something wrong with me.

314
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.099
Because I loved my children, I loved my husband,

315
00:13:36.099 --> 00:13:38.512
I lived in Lakeville, Connecticut.

316
00:13:38.512 --> 00:13:40.638
So, I went to the local psychiatrist.

317
00:13:40.638 --> 00:13:43.974
And as a woman, that I wanted more,

318
00:13:43.974 --> 00:13:45.510
thought more was coming,

319
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.411
I had a greater role to play,

320
00:13:47.411 --> 00:13:51.480
and the analysis was you're neurotic. (laughs)

321
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.783
<v Regina>Because you wanted more</v>

322
00:13:52.783 --> 00:13:55.170
than what the structure was--

323
00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.518
<v ->With five children and a house and a nice husband?</v>

324
00:13:57.521 --> 00:14:00.157
What in the world is wrong with you, Barbara?

325
00:14:00.157 --> 00:14:04.281
So, I then read Abraham Maslow,

326
00:14:04.281 --> 00:14:06.181
that was another point,

327
00:14:06.181 --> 00:14:08.499
Toward a Psychology of Being.

328
00:14:08.499 --> 00:14:12.080
Maslow said when he studied wellness, not sickness,

329
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.306
every fully-functioning, joyful person

330
00:14:15.306 --> 00:14:18.909
had one thing in common, chosen vocation.

331
00:14:18.909 --> 00:14:23.867
Chosen work, they found intrinsically self-rewarding.

332
00:14:23.867 --> 00:14:25.383
And of service.

333
00:14:25.383 --> 00:14:27.851
So, I realized I loved my children,

334
00:14:27.851 --> 00:14:30.454
but motherhood was not my vocation.

335
00:14:30.454 --> 00:14:33.023
that's a really shocking thing in the late 50's.

336
00:14:33.023 --> 00:14:34.224
<v Regina>Yes, yes!</v>

337
00:14:34.224 --> 00:14:35.826
<v ->Early 60's.</v>

338
00:14:35.826 --> 00:14:38.029
But the depression instead of then

339
00:14:38.029 --> 00:14:40.497
being something wrong with me,

340
00:14:40.497 --> 00:14:43.067
was a pressure to express.

341
00:14:43.067 --> 00:14:45.302
That's a very important thing for a woman.

342
00:14:45.302 --> 00:14:47.438
Now we know this much better.

343
00:14:47.438 --> 00:14:49.207
But there's still many women,

344
00:14:49.207 --> 00:14:52.609
who don't fully allow what's inside them

345
00:14:52.609 --> 00:14:54.598
to be fully expressed.

346
00:14:54.598 --> 00:14:58.541
So, I was just seeking how to do that.

347
00:14:58.541 --> 00:15:02.586
And I think the next point in my life that was so important,

348
00:15:02.586 --> 00:15:05.355
was meeting Dr. Jonas Salk.

349
00:15:05.355 --> 00:15:07.424
And I wrote a letter, like I was very bold,

350
00:15:07.424 --> 00:15:09.559
I just would reach out because I now knew

351
00:15:09.559 --> 00:15:11.292
I had to find my vocation.

352
00:15:11.292 --> 00:15:12.529
<v Regina>That's one of the most inspirational</v>

353
00:15:12.529 --> 00:15:13.631
parts of you, by the way,

354
00:15:13.631 --> 00:15:16.167
that you have the nerve to even do these things.

355
00:15:16.167 --> 00:15:19.002
<v ->So, I write to Abraham Maslow, ask him to lunch.</v>

356
00:15:19.002 --> 00:15:21.205
I wrote to Jonas Salk about his theater,

357
00:15:21.205 --> 00:15:23.941
theater of man, I made it up what it should be,

358
00:15:23.941 --> 00:15:26.277
the evolutionary story and so on.

359
00:15:26.277 --> 00:15:29.036
And he called me up one day,

360
00:15:29.036 --> 00:15:30.747
I had just had my fifth child.

361
00:15:30.747 --> 00:15:31.581
I'll never forget it,

362
00:15:31.581 --> 00:15:34.540
it was in the fall of 1964 in New England.

363
00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.522
You know, the beautiful days, and the apple orchard

364
00:15:37.522 --> 00:15:41.292
and all the trees turning yellow and golden.

365
00:15:41.292 --> 00:15:42.860
And the phone rang and he said

366
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.163
"Mrs. Hubbard, this is Jonas Salk.

367
00:15:46.163 --> 00:15:48.432
"I have just read your letter,

368
00:15:48.432 --> 00:15:52.103
"And you have expressed my dream better than I could.

369
00:15:52.103 --> 00:15:55.707
"We are two peas in the same genetic pod.

370
00:15:55.707 --> 00:15:57.441
"Can I take you to lunch?"

371
00:15:57.441 --> 00:15:58.740
<v Regina>Isn't that amazing?</v>

372
00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.544
<v ->Now what happened, this is in the journey</v>

373
00:16:00.544 --> 00:16:04.306
of an evolutionary woman,

374
00:16:04.306 --> 00:16:05.946
evolutionary person,

375
00:16:05.946 --> 00:16:09.138
is I had never met anybody

376
00:16:09.138 --> 00:16:11.348
who had the same coding

377
00:16:11.348 --> 00:16:14.457
of the sense of what's emergent.

378
00:16:14.457 --> 00:16:17.995
It was considered neurotic in the Freudian analysis.

379
00:16:17.995 --> 00:16:21.164
In exurbia you're supposed to be content.

380
00:16:21.164 --> 00:16:23.500
And we were supposed to be content,

381
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.935
and when I wasn't, I felt guilty.

382
00:16:25.935 --> 00:16:27.643
What was wrong with me?

383
00:16:27.643 --> 00:16:29.974
So, he came and took me out to lunch.

384
00:16:29.974 --> 00:16:31.908
And as he was opening the door,

385
00:16:31.908 --> 00:16:35.221
and it was this beautiful fall day,

386
00:16:35.221 --> 00:16:37.281
and he said "This is the garden of Eden."

387
00:16:37.281 --> 00:16:40.581
And I said "Yes, I'm Eve and I'm leaving."

388
00:16:41.351 --> 00:16:44.264
I was going to leave

389
00:16:44.264 --> 00:16:46.334
the role I was in.

390
00:16:46.334 --> 00:16:50.994
I was going to leave the imprint

391
00:16:50.994 --> 00:16:53.264
of my cultural limitations.

392
00:16:53.264 --> 00:16:55.599
But I didn't know what it was.

393
00:16:55.599 --> 00:16:59.006
And when he drove me to New York from Connecticut,

394
00:16:59.006 --> 00:17:00.604
the thing that he did which I think

395
00:17:00.604 --> 00:17:02.373
every evolutionary person needs,

396
00:17:02.373 --> 00:17:04.208
but particularly women,

397
00:17:04.208 --> 00:17:08.264
he said, I told him what was wrong with me.

398
00:17:08.264 --> 00:17:10.842
Desire for the future.

399
00:17:10.842 --> 00:17:12.215
And I thought something great might happen,

400
00:17:12.215 --> 00:17:13.734
and I had something to do about it.

401
00:17:13.734 --> 00:17:14.594
<v Regina>(laughing)</v>

402
00:17:14.594 --> 00:17:17.087
<v ->Oh, oy vey, how sick you must be!</v>

403
00:17:17.087 --> 00:17:20.392
And he said "Barbara, this is not what's wrong about you,

404
00:17:20.392 --> 00:17:23.136
"This is what is right about you.

405
00:17:23.136 --> 00:17:26.779
"You are an evolutionary mutant." (laughs)

406
00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:28.198
<v Regina>Yes, for the time.</v>
<v Barbara>Because in those</v>

407
00:17:28.198 --> 00:17:31.908
<v ->Days before all of this happened,</v>

408
00:17:31.908 --> 00:17:35.372
when a woman had this enormous sense of potentiality,

409
00:17:35.372 --> 00:17:37.841
she thought she was off base--

410
00:17:37.841 --> 00:17:38.508
<v Regina>Delusional.</v>

411
00:17:38.508 --> 00:17:39.844
<v ->Delusional!</v>

412
00:17:39.844 --> 00:17:43.382
So he said "I will introduce you

413
00:17:43.382 --> 00:17:45.162
"To three or four others."

414
00:17:45.162 --> 00:17:47.862
But the key was to be re-cognized.

415
00:17:47.862 --> 00:17:49.519
Recognized.

416
00:17:49.519 --> 00:17:53.819
For the essence of your being as what's emergent,

417
00:17:54.809 --> 00:17:57.929
rather than what's, oh just you know,

418
00:17:57.929 --> 00:18:01.948
your desire to do something or you're self-centered.

419
00:18:01.948 --> 00:18:03.880
No, it wasn't self-centered.

420
00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.302
So, I got totally empowered.

421
00:18:06.302 --> 00:18:10.507
And then I read, the next point was Teilhard de Chardin,

422
00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:13.544
the great Catholic Jesuit paleontologist,

423
00:18:13.544 --> 00:18:16.614
his book Toward a Psychology of Being.

424
00:18:16.614 --> 00:18:19.016
And in that book, this Catholic Jesuit,

425
00:18:19.016 --> 00:18:22.021
who'd never been published by the Church,

426
00:18:22.021 --> 00:18:26.942
experienced the Divine, the God Force, in matter.

427
00:18:26.942 --> 00:18:30.734
He said "Take away God, take away Christ, leave matter."

428
00:18:30.734 --> 00:18:33.964
Because he saw that the universal process of creation

429
00:18:33.964 --> 00:18:36.867
was coming up through energy, through matter,

430
00:18:36.867 --> 00:18:40.604
and he had this law of complexity consciousness.

431
00:18:40.604 --> 00:18:42.419
As systems become more complex,

432
00:18:42.419 --> 00:18:44.888
they jump in consciousness and freedom.

433
00:18:44.888 --> 00:18:47.744
And he saw we were moving towards the noosphere,

434
00:18:47.744 --> 00:18:50.714
connecting center with center, heat with heart.

435
00:18:50.714 --> 00:18:52.383
The thinking layer of earth

436
00:18:52.383 --> 00:18:56.186
made up out of TV, internet, telephones,

437
00:18:56.186 --> 00:18:58.879
communication, consciousness.

438
00:18:58.879 --> 00:19:02.426
And he talked about this great and wonderful event

439
00:19:02.426 --> 00:19:06.163
that would be the connectivity at the center

440
00:19:06.163 --> 00:19:09.849
of the core of our being's en masse.

441
00:19:09.849 --> 00:19:12.168
And that awakened in me

442
00:19:12.168 --> 00:19:16.073
the great thing I thought was coming. (laughs)

443
00:19:16.073 --> 00:19:17.274
<v Regina>You thought it was coming right away?</v>

444
00:19:17.274 --> 00:19:18.275
<v ->No.
<v Regina>Oh.</v>

445
00:19:18.275 --> 00:19:19.743
<v Barbara>I knew, I didn't know when.</v>

446
00:19:19.743 --> 00:19:20.510
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

447
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:21.367
<v ->But when I read</v>

448
00:19:21.367 --> 00:19:24.785
from a scientific, spiritually-based point of view

449
00:19:24.785 --> 00:19:28.275
that earth itself was heading for a time

450
00:19:28.275 --> 00:19:31.488
of massive connectivity through the heart,

451
00:19:31.488 --> 00:19:34.524
and massive intelligence.

452
00:19:34.524 --> 00:19:35.843
So this was really in the--

453
00:19:35.843 --> 00:19:37.737
<v Regina>He was quite a visionary, yes.</v>

454
00:19:37.737 --> 00:19:40.897
<v ->But what I saw, what I felt really,</v>

455
00:19:40.897 --> 00:19:43.834
was that the vision that had motivated me,

456
00:19:43.834 --> 00:19:45.970
that something great wants to happen,

457
00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:47.738
that I'm somehow a part of it,

458
00:19:47.738 --> 00:19:51.569
that everybody's a part of it, got affirmed

459
00:19:51.569 --> 00:19:54.778
by Teilhard's vision of the omega,

460
00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:57.067
the noosphere coming together.

461
00:19:57.067 --> 00:19:59.149
And what happened was that the

462
00:19:59.149 --> 00:20:03.120
internal pressure to evolve and to express

463
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.278
got affirmed

464
00:20:05.278 --> 00:20:08.298
at a spiritual and evolutionary level.

465
00:20:08.298 --> 00:20:11.295
Now there's one thing to go vertical to God,

466
00:20:11.295 --> 00:20:14.464
it's another thing to realize the process of creation

467
00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:16.600
is flowing through all of life.

468
00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.370
And that your desire to evolve,

469
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.305
my desire to express,

470
00:20:21.305 --> 00:20:23.640
was the Divine force in me,

471
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.009
was the universal process of creation.

472
00:20:26.009 --> 00:20:30.281
And when I got that I am the universe evolving,

473
00:20:30.281 --> 00:20:32.522
and so is everybody else,

474
00:20:32.522 --> 00:20:34.522
plus Jonas having affirmed

475
00:20:34.522 --> 00:20:39.456
this psychological need for expression and participation,

476
00:20:39.456 --> 00:20:42.025
I became an evolutionary woman.

477
00:20:42.025 --> 00:20:43.593
<v Regina>And you became one at a time,</v>

478
00:20:43.593 --> 00:20:45.132
you were really--
<v Barbara>Early 60's.</v>

479
00:20:45.132 --> 00:20:47.704
<v Regina>One of the first of this wave, really.</v>

480
00:20:47.704 --> 00:20:48.831
<v ->I was.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

481
00:20:48.831 --> 00:20:50.367
<v Barbara>And another word for it I have is</v>

482
00:20:50.367 --> 00:20:53.470
a feminine co-creator.

483
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:55.729
<v Regina>And this is really important now.</v>

484
00:20:55.729 --> 00:20:58.041
First, if you don't mind hopping next

485
00:20:58.041 --> 00:21:00.937
because I think coming after this was Sri Aurobindo?

486
00:21:00.937 --> 00:21:01.478
<v ->Yes.</v>

487
00:21:01.478 --> 00:21:02.172
<v Regina>And The Mother.</v>

488
00:21:02.172 --> 00:21:02.750
<v ->Yes.</v>

489
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.072
<v Regina>Can you talk a little bit about that</v>

490
00:21:04.072 --> 00:21:06.316
and how that essentially fleshed out

491
00:21:06.316 --> 00:21:08.519
this understanding for you even more.

492
00:21:08.519 --> 00:21:09.586
<v ->Yes.</v>

493
00:21:09.586 --> 00:21:12.723
So, there was Maslow, Toward a Psychology of Being,

494
00:21:12.723 --> 00:21:14.846
everyone has chosen vocation.

495
00:21:14.846 --> 00:21:16.860
You've got to express your life purpose.

496
00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.004
Jonas recognizing

497
00:21:19.004 --> 00:21:22.364
the internal being as good.

498
00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:25.369
The Teilhard de Chardin seeing God in evolution

499
00:21:25.369 --> 00:21:28.270
leading to omega.

500
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:32.663
Then Aurobindo, I don't remember how I found it,

501
00:21:32.663 --> 00:21:36.038
but I found the book The Life Divine,

502
00:21:36.038 --> 00:21:37.908
which is his masterwork.

503
00:21:37.908 --> 00:21:40.084
And he traces what he calls

504
00:21:40.084 --> 00:21:43.421
the supramental intelligence of God,

505
00:21:43.421 --> 00:21:45.578
the consciousness force.

506
00:21:45.578 --> 00:21:50.227
And he thought it was dynamic, purposeful and directional.

507
00:21:50.227 --> 00:21:52.462
That the purpose of evolution

508
00:21:52.462 --> 00:21:55.232
was not to get off the wheel of life,

509
00:21:55.232 --> 00:21:58.268
it was not to dissolve into the one,

510
00:21:58.268 --> 00:22:02.038
but it was for that core of the spiral, as I think of it,

511
00:22:02.038 --> 00:22:04.041
that the consciousness force that came up

512
00:22:04.041 --> 00:22:05.408
through matter and life,

513
00:22:05.408 --> 00:22:08.279
was coming up through the great avatars.

514
00:22:08.279 --> 00:22:10.648
It was coming up through him.

515
00:22:10.648 --> 00:22:14.463
But he and The Mother together,

516
00:22:14.463 --> 00:22:17.540
could hold the space in consciousness.

517
00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.480
(coughs) Excuse me.

518
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.792
He and The Mother together,

519
00:22:21.792 --> 00:22:24.427
this great woman and man together,

520
00:22:24.427 --> 00:22:28.298
could hold the space that what was going to happen

521
00:22:28.298 --> 00:22:32.035
was that the supramental universal intelligence

522
00:22:32.035 --> 00:22:36.072
would incarnate in us as us.

523
00:22:36.072 --> 00:22:38.295
And we would become

524
00:22:38.295 --> 00:22:41.245
the Gnostic Humans.

525
00:22:42.485 --> 00:22:45.048
This is the next stage of human evolution.

526
00:22:45.048 --> 00:22:49.619
And I realized that in my evolutionary intuition

527
00:22:49.619 --> 00:22:52.790
it wasn't just getting to be better like we are.

528
00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:55.725
It wasn't just slightly improving things on earth.

529
00:22:55.725 --> 00:22:57.227
It was new.

530
00:22:57.227 --> 00:22:59.579
And I could see it through Teilhard it was new.

531
00:22:59.579 --> 00:23:02.765
But I got through Aurobindo and The Mother

532
00:23:02.765 --> 00:23:05.998
that the newness was in the person

533
00:23:05.998 --> 00:23:08.505
evolving to, really you might say

534
00:23:08.505 --> 00:23:10.240
the next level or a species.

535
00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.274
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

536
00:23:11.274 --> 00:23:14.378
<v ->And it affirmed in me,</v>

537
00:23:14.378 --> 00:23:18.548
the enormity of that inner mutation

538
00:23:18.548 --> 00:23:22.852
along with the social and scientific and technological

539
00:23:22.852 --> 00:23:24.421
that was the noosphere.

540
00:23:24.421 --> 00:23:28.158
So, I felt that the great Eastern sage,

541
00:23:28.158 --> 00:23:30.763
that he transcended the Eastern culture.

542
00:23:30.763 --> 00:23:31.228
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

543
00:23:31.228 --> 00:23:34.630
<v ->He transcended Hinduism and Buddhism</v>

544
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:38.503
into the evolution of our species.

545
00:23:38.503 --> 00:23:39.436
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

546
00:23:39.436 --> 00:23:41.738
<v ->But you got the person coming out of this,</v>

547
00:23:41.738 --> 00:23:44.041
not the dissolving into the one.

548
00:23:44.041 --> 00:23:48.330
With Teilhard de Chardin you've got the ultra-person,

549
00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:50.377
the Christed person.

550
00:23:50.377 --> 00:23:53.017
Aurobindo and The Mother never even mentioned Christ.

551
00:23:53.017 --> 00:23:54.184
And I could see obviously,

552
00:23:54.184 --> 00:23:57.116
this wasn't a religion, it was a person.

553
00:23:57.116 --> 00:24:00.604
But Aurobindo and The Mother said you can't do this alone,

554
00:24:00.604 --> 00:24:04.473
and it's not just one or two great people doing it.

555
00:24:04.473 --> 00:24:05.963
She built Auroville.

556
00:24:05.963 --> 00:24:06.396
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

557
00:24:06.396 --> 00:24:08.924
<v ->I never have been to Auroville.</v>

558
00:24:08.924 --> 00:24:10.733
But I know about it, I've read about it, I've--

559
00:24:10.733 --> 00:24:12.802
<v Regina>You have to go to the Matrimandir</v>

560
00:24:12.802 --> 00:24:14.815
if only for one meditation.

561
00:24:14.815 --> 00:24:16.039
<v ->I want to do that.</v>

562
00:24:16.039 --> 00:24:17.442
I've been invited there many times,

563
00:24:17.442 --> 00:24:20.344
but I just didn't go yet.

564
00:24:20.344 --> 00:24:23.846
So, Aurobindo

565
00:24:23.846 --> 00:24:27.680
and The Mother, who I think is probably the greatest

566
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.740
feminine co-creator of modern times,

567
00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.965
of any times perhaps.

568
00:24:32.965 --> 00:24:35.294
<v Regina>She embodied an incredible energy.</v>

569
00:24:35.294 --> 00:24:36.660
And message and vision.

570
00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:37.827
<v ->She had it.</v>

571
00:24:37.827 --> 00:24:40.363
And she and Aurobindo together modeled it.

572
00:24:40.363 --> 00:24:44.967
Teilhard was able to evolve that great Christ story,

573
00:24:44.967 --> 00:24:48.605
into the Christification of the earth.

574
00:24:48.605 --> 00:24:53.511
And so then the third or fourth, was Buckminster Fuller.

575
00:24:53.511 --> 00:24:56.512
And he had an experience

576
00:24:56.512 --> 00:25:00.617
that he was actually able to express

577
00:25:00.617 --> 00:25:03.105
that Christ consciousness

578
00:25:03.105 --> 00:25:05.776
by the Design Science Revolution.

579
00:25:05.776 --> 00:25:07.133
And what would that mean?

580
00:25:07.133 --> 00:25:09.293
It means we have the technology,

581
00:25:09.293 --> 00:25:13.750
the resources, the know-how to make of this world

582
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.798
a sustainable,

583
00:25:15.798 --> 00:25:18.738
beautiful place for every human being

584
00:25:18.738 --> 00:25:20.938
as the beginning

585
00:25:20.938 --> 00:25:24.475
of our role as citizens of the cosmos.

586
00:25:24.475 --> 00:25:28.444
And from Bucky I got the Design Science Revolution.

587
00:25:28.444 --> 00:25:30.613
That there is a design in here,

588
00:25:30.613 --> 00:25:32.572
there's a social, scientific,

589
00:25:32.572 --> 00:25:36.032
systemic, synergetic design.

590
00:25:36.032 --> 00:25:40.757
So, between Maslow, Teilhard, Aurobindo and The Mother

591
00:25:40.757 --> 00:25:43.393
and Buckminster Fuller and the,

592
00:25:43.393 --> 00:25:46.463
then I said "Okay, well what's my part in this?"

593
00:25:46.463 --> 00:25:49.466
Because it's one thing to have all these great ideas,

594
00:25:49.466 --> 00:25:53.003
but I knew that without vocation, it wouldn't work.

595
00:25:53.003 --> 00:25:56.421
So, I asked the universe a question

596
00:25:56.421 --> 00:25:58.081
in 1966,

597
00:25:58.081 --> 00:26:01.501
what is our story

598
00:26:01.501 --> 00:26:04.014
that is comparable in importance

599
00:26:04.014 --> 00:26:06.716
to the story of the birth of Christ?

600
00:26:06.716 --> 00:26:09.320
That is to say, the Gospels wrote something down,

601
00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.888
changed the world.

602
00:26:11.888 --> 00:26:12.526
I asked,

603
00:26:12.526 --> 00:26:17.126
what story could humanity express,

604
00:26:17.126 --> 00:26:18.995
mainly through our artists,

605
00:26:18.995 --> 00:26:21.965
that would be able to be so powerful

606
00:26:21.965 --> 00:26:25.187
that it would transform the world,

607
00:26:25.187 --> 00:26:27.670
as the story of the birth of Christ did for its time,

608
00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:30.340
but this is more cuz it's the whole world.

609
00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.676
So, I demanded to know.

610
00:26:32.676 --> 00:26:35.878
And I got shot up into the universe like an astronaut,

611
00:26:35.878 --> 00:26:38.014
I felt the earth as a living system,

612
00:26:38.014 --> 00:26:42.419
I felt it feel the pain, the suffering, the hunger,

613
00:26:42.419 --> 00:26:45.222
the poverty, the war.

614
00:26:45.222 --> 00:26:48.024
And that pain became so great that we stopped,

615
00:26:48.024 --> 00:26:50.927
and then I got a few frames ahead in the movie.

616
00:26:50.927 --> 00:26:54.097
I felt the empathy, I felt the inner voices,

617
00:26:54.097 --> 00:26:57.333
I felt the healing.

618
00:26:57.333 --> 00:26:58.869
And then what happened,

619
00:26:58.869 --> 00:27:01.869
is the synchronization of the social systems,

620
00:27:01.869 --> 00:27:04.373
and that goes to my vision that I had to begin with.

621
00:27:04.373 --> 00:27:05.274
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

622
00:27:05.274 --> 00:27:08.912
<v ->In health, in education, in economics, in media,</v>

623
00:27:08.912 --> 00:27:13.883
in relationships, in environment.

624
00:27:13.883 --> 00:27:18.789
The new systems coordinated in this vision.

625
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:21.658
And we found out exactly what Bucky said,

626
00:27:21.658 --> 00:27:24.194
we have the technology, resources and know-how,

627
00:27:24.194 --> 00:27:26.496
and then we have the consciousness,

628
00:27:26.496 --> 00:27:29.098
the heart, the connectivity.

629
00:27:29.098 --> 00:27:31.268
And the words I heard

630
00:27:31.268 --> 00:27:34.888
is our crisis is a birth.

631
00:27:34.888 --> 00:27:38.975
Our story is the story of the birth

632
00:27:38.975 --> 00:27:41.893
of a universal, co-evolving,

633
00:27:41.893 --> 00:27:44.843
co-creative humanity.

634
00:27:44.843 --> 00:27:49.285
What Christ and all the avatars came to tell us is true.

635
00:27:49.285 --> 00:27:52.322
We are one body, we are whole, we are good,

636
00:27:52.322 --> 00:27:56.526
we are born into a universe filled with life.

637
00:27:56.526 --> 00:28:01.498
Go tell the story of our birth, Barbara.

638
00:28:01.498 --> 00:28:06.336
So I would say I got my vocation, as many people do,

639
00:28:06.336 --> 00:28:09.004
from inspired insights.

640
00:28:09.004 --> 00:28:11.908
It's not just you sit down and you try to plan it out.

641
00:28:11.908 --> 00:28:13.943
You get inspired.

642
00:28:13.943 --> 00:28:15.545
And you ask questions.

643
00:28:15.545 --> 00:28:17.348
And you demand to know

644
00:28:17.348 --> 00:28:21.211
and it'll come, cuz everybody has it.

645
00:28:21.217 --> 00:28:25.121
I got my vocation is to be a storyteller,

646
00:28:25.121 --> 00:28:26.656
and what I'm finding right now

647
00:28:26.656 --> 00:28:30.594
is the story I'm to tell is the story that's happening.

648
00:28:30.594 --> 00:28:32.362
<v Regina>And a masterful storyteller,</v>

649
00:28:32.362 --> 00:28:36.102
and we need to have some of this synthesized for us

650
00:28:36.102 --> 00:28:39.621
while we go through the crisis part as well.

651
00:28:39.621 --> 00:28:41.758
I think most people here at this conference,

652
00:28:41.758 --> 00:28:44.456
each in their own way, can see to the other side,

653
00:28:44.456 --> 00:28:47.066
that's what motivates people on this path.

654
00:28:47.066 --> 00:28:50.547
But there's almost this stepping around the crisis part,

655
00:28:50.547 --> 00:28:54.958
everybody says I yield, I will surrender,

656
00:28:54.958 --> 00:28:56.200
and be part of this

657
00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:00.252
because I've chosen to incarnate to be part of this

658
00:29:00.252 --> 00:29:01.952
until we do give birth to ourselves,

659
00:29:01.952 --> 00:29:03.926
our new selves on the other side.

660
00:29:03.926 --> 00:29:06.563
And I'd like to talk about some of the,

661
00:29:06.563 --> 00:29:08.764
as you said, the old structures need to go away.

662
00:29:08.764 --> 00:29:12.535
The old structures will not be serving us in the future.

663
00:29:12.535 --> 00:29:14.604
So, there has to be a letting go,

664
00:29:14.604 --> 00:29:18.175
a profound letting go, of almost everything familiar.

665
00:29:18.175 --> 00:29:21.550
<v ->This is true, you see all the old structures</v>

666
00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.913
are what built civilization.

667
00:29:23.913 --> 00:29:26.826
Just to give this briefly, before

668
00:29:26.826 --> 00:29:28.851
let's say hundreds of thousands of years,

669
00:29:28.851 --> 00:29:30.520
we were either hunter-gatherers

670
00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.588
and then we became small tribes.

671
00:29:32.588 --> 00:29:35.291
So, we actually were in holistic environments

672
00:29:35.291 --> 00:29:37.126
in the sense that we knew each other

673
00:29:37.126 --> 00:29:39.328
and we had the small group.

674
00:29:39.328 --> 00:29:40.730
Then when we got surplus

675
00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:42.832
of agriculture and other phenomenon,

676
00:29:42.832 --> 00:29:45.869
we started to get a top-down structure,

677
00:29:45.869 --> 00:29:47.337
a pyramid structure.

678
00:29:47.337 --> 00:29:50.340
And you get emperors and kings and priests,

679
00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.642
and for whatever reason this came in,

680
00:29:52.642 --> 00:29:55.245
it was top-down and the people on the bottom

681
00:29:55.245 --> 00:29:57.981
did not know and did not have control,

682
00:29:57.981 --> 00:30:00.851
and the people on the top dominated the whole system.

683
00:30:00.851 --> 00:30:04.687
And it, for better or worse, it built the religions.

684
00:30:04.687 --> 00:30:06.796
It built the governments.

685
00:30:06.796 --> 00:30:09.993
It built even science and democracy.

686
00:30:09.993 --> 00:30:12.062
It was from top down.

687
00:30:12.062 --> 00:30:13.863
It certainly built the global corporations.

688
00:30:13.863 --> 00:30:15.632
It built the nation state.

689
00:30:15.632 --> 00:30:18.844
And suddenly the top-down, pyramidal structure

690
00:30:18.844 --> 00:30:22.039
that's patriarchal, is failing

691
00:30:22.039 --> 00:30:26.812
to respond to the crises like global warming,

692
00:30:26.812 --> 00:30:30.212
financial collapse, resource depletion.

693
00:30:30.212 --> 00:30:34.116
You cannot solve it by doing more of the same.

694
00:30:34.116 --> 00:30:37.446
And the real key here is failure.

695
00:30:37.446 --> 00:30:38.288
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

696
00:30:38.288 --> 00:30:41.921
<v ->It isn't just the religions, the moral precepts,</v>

697
00:30:41.921 --> 00:30:44.728
the people of good will.

698
00:30:44.728 --> 00:30:46.696
We've been around for some time,

699
00:30:46.696 --> 00:30:48.899
but a global crisis that could destroy

700
00:30:48.899 --> 00:30:51.401
our life support system, is new.

701
00:30:51.401 --> 00:30:51.901
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

702
00:30:51.901 --> 00:30:53.770
<v ->And it appears to me,</v>

703
00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:56.307
that the nature of evolution is such

704
00:30:56.307 --> 00:30:59.809
that crisis precedes transformation.

705
00:30:59.809 --> 00:31:02.544
We had humanity,

706
00:31:02.544 --> 00:31:04.614
and John Perkins said it so well today,

707
00:31:04.614 --> 00:31:07.951
has hit for the first time a global crisis

708
00:31:07.951 --> 00:31:09.886
that's to earth life.

709
00:31:09.886 --> 00:31:11.754
It's not even just to humanity,

710
00:31:11.754 --> 00:31:14.357
but humanity's causing it by its growth

711
00:31:14.357 --> 00:31:16.633
and by its success.

712
00:31:17.463 --> 00:31:18.662
<v Regina>Seeming success.</v>

713
00:31:18.662 --> 00:31:21.670
<v ->Well you know--
<v Regina>Paradigm, yes.</v>

714
00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:26.035
<v Barbara>Well, when I graduated from Bryn Mawr College,</v>

715
00:31:26.035 --> 00:31:27.593
there was a lot of well-meaning people,

716
00:31:27.593 --> 00:31:30.206
there were a lot of well-meaning people there.

717
00:31:30.206 --> 00:31:33.543
And the basic thought was, we've solved all our problems.

718
00:31:33.543 --> 00:31:35.878
We didn't know.

719
00:31:35.878 --> 00:31:37.146
Robert Muller, who was

720
00:31:37.146 --> 00:31:39.983
Assistant Secretary General of the UN,

721
00:31:39.983 --> 00:31:42.619
told me that when he tried to have a conference,

722
00:31:42.619 --> 00:31:45.355
I believe it was in the 60's,

723
00:31:45.355 --> 00:31:50.159
on the environment, we did not yet have a word for it.

724
00:31:50.159 --> 00:31:54.197
We didn't really know about the biosphere collectively.

725
00:31:54.197 --> 00:31:55.631
We certainly didn't know

726
00:31:55.631 --> 00:31:58.735
that we were overpopulating or polluting.

727
00:31:58.735 --> 00:32:01.338
And until that signal came out,

728
00:32:01.338 --> 00:32:06.243
through Rachel Carson and others in the early 60's,

729
00:32:06.243 --> 00:32:07.810
we didn't know.

730
00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:10.546
And maybe the truth is

731
00:32:10.546 --> 00:32:12.915
like a baby growing in the womb,

732
00:32:12.915 --> 00:32:16.251
we are self-centered, self-conscious species.

733
00:32:16.251 --> 00:32:18.521
We probably have many faults and we don't know

734
00:32:18.521 --> 00:32:21.191
'til we see another planet go through this,

735
00:32:21.191 --> 00:32:22.925
but the most dangerous time

736
00:32:22.925 --> 00:32:25.761
for any intelligent species is when you hit

737
00:32:25.761 --> 00:32:28.898
your high-tech, over-populating, polluting phase

738
00:32:28.898 --> 00:32:31.000
with this degree of power,

739
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.838
that came from our intelligence, to survive.

740
00:32:35.838 --> 00:32:39.954
And we had our illusions of separateness

741
00:32:39.954 --> 00:32:42.846
was maybe exaggerated for some reason on this planet.

742
00:32:42.846 --> 00:32:46.182
But our success was natural.

743
00:32:46.182 --> 00:32:49.420
And we hit a limit, which began to be felt

744
00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:52.753
in the 60's, 70's, 80's and suddenly

745
00:32:52.753 --> 00:32:55.933
with these crises, including the global warming

746
00:32:55.933 --> 00:32:58.260
and the gulf crisis and other crises,

747
00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.563
the signal is going out to hundreds of millions

748
00:33:00.563 --> 00:33:04.567
of ordinary people, that we may not survive.

749
00:33:04.567 --> 00:33:06.970
That's essential.

750
00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:08.505
If we didn't have that,

751
00:33:08.505 --> 00:33:11.041
all the religions in the world combined,

752
00:33:11.041 --> 00:33:13.910
with the ethic of love your neighbor as yourself,

753
00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:15.444
isn't enough for some reason.

754
00:33:15.444 --> 00:33:17.021
<v Regina>No, I agree.</v>

755
00:33:17.021 --> 00:33:19.282
We're wired to respond to crises,

756
00:33:19.282 --> 00:33:20.783
individually and collectively.

757
00:33:20.783 --> 00:33:23.920
<v ->So let's say evidently,</v>

758
00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:28.258
this is what it's taking to do it.

759
00:33:28.258 --> 00:33:32.725
So, I'm not right now judging all of evolution.

760
00:33:32.725 --> 00:33:35.632
I don't know enough.

761
00:33:35.632 --> 00:33:38.301
But I do know that the signal has gone out,

762
00:33:38.301 --> 00:33:41.705
you can destroy your life support system if you continue.

763
00:33:41.705 --> 00:33:43.506
So, conscious evolution,

764
00:33:43.506 --> 00:33:46.709
which is the revelation that came to me,

765
00:33:46.709 --> 00:33:48.277
not only the story of our birth

766
00:33:48.277 --> 00:33:50.746
but the evolution itself,

767
00:33:50.746 --> 00:33:54.150
was hitting a new stage where it was becoming

768
00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:56.686
conscious in us, through us.

769
00:33:56.686 --> 00:34:00.996
We are evolution, becoming aware we're affecting

770
00:34:00.996 --> 00:34:03.327
our own evolution by everything we do.

771
00:34:03.327 --> 00:34:05.524
This is the wake-up call.

772
00:34:05.524 --> 00:34:06.128
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

773
00:34:06.128 --> 00:34:08.735
<v ->So, all the great mystics and traditions</v>

774
00:34:08.735 --> 00:34:11.601
are waking up to come out of the closet.

775
00:34:11.601 --> 00:34:14.170
The monks and the priests and the shamans

776
00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:15.671
are all out there now.

777
00:34:15.671 --> 00:34:17.813
But you know who's really out there?

778
00:34:17.813 --> 00:34:20.076
The ordinary folks.

779
00:34:20.076 --> 00:34:23.379
The millions of people who seem to be waking to empathy,

780
00:34:23.379 --> 00:34:26.015
to the internal desire, the women,

781
00:34:26.015 --> 00:34:28.552
desiring to express their unique purpose.

782
00:34:28.552 --> 00:34:31.019
They don't have to be a saint or an avatar

783
00:34:31.019 --> 00:34:33.223
to get that you're evolving.

784
00:34:33.223 --> 00:34:36.583
And I think the really...

785
00:34:36.583 --> 00:34:37.351
What is happening,

786
00:34:37.351 --> 00:34:41.406
I call it the evolutionary potential movement,

787
00:34:41.406 --> 00:34:42.931
is growing in every field.

788
00:34:42.931 --> 00:34:45.400
It's not just fixing problems,

789
00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.970
it's realizing new possibilities.

790
00:34:47.970 --> 00:34:49.672
And going back to the vision of this room

791
00:34:49.672 --> 00:34:51.041
with all the screens,

792
00:34:51.041 --> 00:34:54.977
the connectivity of all that creativity.

793
00:34:54.977 --> 00:34:55.545
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

794
00:34:55.545 --> 00:34:59.148
<v ->The non-linear, exponential creativity</v>

795
00:34:59.148 --> 00:35:04.103
of what's already there in itself is enough

796
00:35:04.103 --> 00:35:07.176
to make us aware of the emerging world.

797
00:35:07.176 --> 00:35:07.757
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

798
00:35:07.757 --> 00:35:10.826
<v ->We can survive, Bucky was right.</v>

799
00:35:10.826 --> 00:35:12.161
<v Regina>And you asked a question</v>

800
00:35:12.161 --> 00:35:16.398
in your talk earlier today, the response was interesting.

801
00:35:16.398 --> 00:35:19.302
You said let me see a show of hands,

802
00:35:19.302 --> 00:35:22.806
for all the women in the room who feel that you are,

803
00:35:22.806 --> 00:35:25.508
I don't remember the exact wording but essentially,

804
00:35:25.508 --> 00:35:28.063
you are part of this emerging,

805
00:35:28.063 --> 00:35:30.613
you are embodying or participating in this

806
00:35:30.613 --> 00:35:33.316
conscious evolution in some way.

807
00:35:33.316 --> 00:35:34.884
And I don't remember if you said through art or what,

808
00:35:34.884 --> 00:35:36.052
I don't think that was it,

809
00:35:36.052 --> 00:35:37.153
you can tell us what you said,

810
00:35:37.153 --> 00:35:40.657
but you asked that question and more than half

811
00:35:40.657 --> 00:35:42.793
of the women in the room raised their hand.

812
00:35:42.793 --> 00:35:45.881
Then you asked the exact same question of the men,

813
00:35:45.881 --> 00:35:48.864
do you feel that you're part of this emergence?

814
00:35:48.864 --> 00:35:51.934
And only I think two or three, from where I could see,

815
00:35:51.934 --> 00:35:55.093
only a half a dozen or less men raised their hand.

816
00:35:55.093 --> 00:35:57.373
That was very interesting.

817
00:35:57.373 --> 00:35:59.243
Tell us what that phenomena is.

818
00:35:59.243 --> 00:36:02.625
<v ->Well, I've noticed as a woman and a mother,</v>

819
00:36:02.625 --> 00:36:06.183
is that the shift from procreation

820
00:36:06.183 --> 00:36:07.884
and the yearning to reproduce

821
00:36:07.884 --> 00:36:09.552
and to give birth through your body

822
00:36:09.552 --> 00:36:11.821
and to hold the newborn child

823
00:36:11.821 --> 00:36:14.790
and to nurse it, and love it and give your life for it,

824
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:17.626
that's programmed into our hormones.

825
00:36:17.626 --> 00:36:19.729
When the women got the signal,

826
00:36:19.729 --> 00:36:21.163
not only through the feminist movement

827
00:36:21.163 --> 00:36:22.698
but through the environmental movement

828
00:36:22.698 --> 00:36:23.799
and to the reality

829
00:36:23.799 --> 00:36:27.236
of the planetary overloading of population,

830
00:36:27.236 --> 00:36:29.573
one more doubling, we're out.

831
00:36:29.573 --> 00:36:33.710
Women began to wake up and to evolve.

832
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:35.111
I think of it like this,

833
00:36:35.111 --> 00:36:39.248
the desire for procreation and nurturing of the child

834
00:36:39.248 --> 00:36:42.418
into the desire for self-expression,

835
00:36:42.418 --> 00:36:45.555
and from self-reproduction to self-evolution.

836
00:36:45.555 --> 00:36:47.823
And women started to be awakened

837
00:36:47.823 --> 00:36:50.226
to their own creativity.

838
00:36:50.226 --> 00:36:53.330
To their own inner spiritual creativity.

839
00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:54.930
Not just my profession is,

840
00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:56.899
or how I can get to be equal to men

841
00:36:56.899 --> 00:36:58.934
in a dysfunctional world.

842
00:36:58.934 --> 00:37:01.870
It's not to get to the top of the glass ceiling.

843
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:06.571
It's actually to express, and I felt and asked

844
00:37:07.431 --> 00:37:09.711
that women are giving birth

845
00:37:09.711 --> 00:37:12.583
to the authentic feminine self.

846
00:37:12.583 --> 00:37:17.162
That there's a new phase, particularly for women over 50,

847
00:37:17.162 --> 00:37:20.056
50, 60, 70, I'm 80!

848
00:37:20.056 --> 00:37:23.259
I call it regenopause.

849
00:37:23.259 --> 00:37:24.160
<v Regina>I love that term.</v>

850
00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.697
<v ->The pause where your body is aging,</v>

851
00:37:27.697 --> 00:37:30.365
the whole thing after menopause we're aging and dying,

852
00:37:30.365 --> 00:37:32.502
but actually you're rising.

853
00:37:32.502 --> 00:37:35.071
Because your spirituality, your creativity,

854
00:37:35.071 --> 00:37:37.173
in women over 50!

855
00:37:37.173 --> 00:37:40.744
Women 50 used to be old!

856
00:37:40.744 --> 00:37:42.579
Women over 50, I think of it like this,

857
00:37:42.579 --> 00:37:44.747
the body may be aging but this is going like this

858
00:37:44.747 --> 00:37:48.451
and the body gets confused. (laughs)

859
00:37:48.451 --> 00:37:49.819
<v Regina>And starts re-patterning itself.</v>

860
00:37:49.819 --> 00:37:52.354
<v ->And it starts to re-pattern because look at me,</v>

861
00:37:52.354 --> 00:37:55.547
I actually feel new.

862
00:37:55.547 --> 00:37:56.259
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

863
00:37:56.259 --> 00:38:00.330
<v ->Not aging, or saging, or youthing.</v>

864
00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:01.263
<v Regina>That's a critical distinction--</v>

865
00:38:01.263 --> 00:38:02.531
<v ->But I feel emergent.</v>

866
00:38:02.531 --> 00:38:03.700
<v Regina>Yes, exactly.</v>

867
00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.135
<v ->So, I asked the women</v>

868
00:38:06.135 --> 00:38:08.787
how many of you feel

869
00:38:08.787 --> 00:38:11.227
that something is emerging in you?

870
00:38:11.227 --> 00:38:13.976
And most of them were over 50 in this audience.

871
00:38:13.976 --> 00:38:16.378
That something is emerging in you that's creative

872
00:38:16.378 --> 00:38:20.675
that hasn't yet fully expressed itself.

873
00:38:20.675 --> 00:38:22.652
Everybody, including me.

874
00:38:22.652 --> 00:38:24.420
Why is that?

875
00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:27.590
I think it's because we're designed to give birth,

876
00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:31.026
and we're not gonna give birth to many babies,

877
00:38:31.026 --> 00:38:33.339
and the women over 50,

878
00:38:33.339 --> 00:38:35.164
no more eggs, we are the egg.

879
00:38:35.164 --> 00:38:36.198
<v Regina>Yeah, we are the egg.</v>

880
00:38:36.198 --> 00:38:38.601
<v ->We are the egg and what we're giving birth to</v>

881
00:38:38.601 --> 00:38:41.873
in our authentic feminine self, is the creative self.

882
00:38:41.873 --> 00:38:42.738
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

883
00:38:42.738 --> 00:38:46.235
<v ->And it doesn't wanna create more of the same.</v>

884
00:38:46.235 --> 00:38:48.579
And so the very same unconditional love

885
00:38:48.579 --> 00:38:51.146
that would give a woman the ability

886
00:38:51.146 --> 00:38:52.515
to go through the pain of birth

887
00:38:52.515 --> 00:38:55.284
and love that child no matter what,

888
00:38:55.284 --> 00:38:59.688
gives the feminine a love of the unknown world.

889
00:38:59.688 --> 00:39:03.959
And the willingness to give herself into her vocation,

890
00:39:03.959 --> 00:39:07.496
and I call it vocational arousal.

891
00:39:07.496 --> 00:39:11.601
It's the same thing as sexual arousal at the next level.

892
00:39:11.601 --> 00:39:15.071
<v Regina>Yes and that does make a lot of sense.</v>

893
00:39:15.071 --> 00:39:17.206
I mean, just looking at it from a very basic level

894
00:39:17.206 --> 00:39:18.607
of every woman who's given birth

895
00:39:18.607 --> 00:39:22.713
understanding this sense of high creativity,

896
00:39:22.713 --> 00:39:26.849
unpredictability, an expectation to embrace someone

897
00:39:26.849 --> 00:39:28.150
you've never met before.

898
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:30.252
You don't know what this being's bringing into your world,

899
00:39:30.252 --> 00:39:32.188
but you're totally, you know intuitively

900
00:39:32.188 --> 00:39:34.489
that you're committed to this journey.

901
00:39:34.489 --> 00:39:37.760
And to take that, take the babies out of it, (laughs)

902
00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.161
the hormones out of it,

903
00:39:39.161 --> 00:39:43.199
and still embody that same inner quest

904
00:39:43.199 --> 00:39:44.866
makes perfect sense.

905
00:39:44.866 --> 00:39:47.517
<v ->And this willingness to not know--</v>

906
00:39:47.517 --> 00:39:48.967
<v Regina>Yes!</v>

907
00:39:48.967 --> 00:39:51.008
<v ->Even who you are yet.</v>

908
00:39:51.008 --> 00:39:51.508
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

909
00:39:51.508 --> 00:39:52.944
<v ->And it's so interesting if a woman</v>

910
00:39:52.944 --> 00:39:57.134
60 or 70 years old says to me

911
00:39:58.284 --> 00:40:01.183
"I'm not sure what I'm becoming."

912
00:40:01.183 --> 00:40:03.920
It's one thing, it was bad enough for me to say it at 30,

913
00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:07.723
but 60 or 70, or 80 for that matter,

914
00:40:07.723 --> 00:40:11.694
to be still emergent and not exactly sure.

915
00:40:11.694 --> 00:40:15.527
Now I call this vocational arousal.

916
00:40:15.527 --> 00:40:16.883
Being the life pulse,

917
00:40:16.883 --> 00:40:21.470
the impulse of evolution arising as you, your expression,

918
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:24.774
and you have to follow a compass of joy.

919
00:40:24.774 --> 00:40:27.523
Because there's nobody out there to tell you

920
00:40:27.523 --> 00:40:29.412
this is what you need to do.

921
00:40:29.412 --> 00:40:31.864
<v Regina>Has to be your resonance, yes.</v>

922
00:40:31.864 --> 00:40:33.983
<v ->And because these vocations</v>

923
00:40:33.983 --> 00:40:36.485
usually don't yet have a label,

924
00:40:36.485 --> 00:40:38.978
they don't have, you don't go to school for them,

925
00:40:38.978 --> 00:40:40.822
and usually there's no pay.

926
00:40:40.822 --> 00:40:43.626
You have to become entrepreneurial.

927
00:40:43.626 --> 00:40:46.328
You have to become co-creative.

928
00:40:46.328 --> 00:40:49.098
You have got to find partners.

929
00:40:49.098 --> 00:40:51.434
And when you find a partner,

930
00:40:51.434 --> 00:40:54.737
that somehow your vocational arousal

931
00:40:54.737 --> 00:40:58.475
excites that partner, and that partner's creativity

932
00:40:58.475 --> 00:41:01.610
excites your vocational arousal

933
00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:05.281
and you feel that maybe by joining, becoming a team,

934
00:41:05.281 --> 00:41:08.283
that you could better fulfill each of you,

935
00:41:08.283 --> 00:41:11.964
you get suprasexual excitement! (laughs)

936
00:41:11.964 --> 00:41:13.589
<v Regina>I was going to ask you about that,</v>

937
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:16.191
I love going from Sri Aurobindo's supermental

938
00:41:16.191 --> 00:41:18.527
to your suprasexual.

939
00:41:18.527 --> 00:41:19.962
<v ->That's a really good jump, isn't it?</v>

940
00:41:19.962 --> 00:41:21.347
<v Regina>It is a good jump.</v>

941
00:41:21.347 --> 00:41:22.864
But I wanted you to make that leap

942
00:41:22.864 --> 00:41:25.057
because what we're talking about is

943
00:41:25.057 --> 00:41:28.938
the emergence of an entirely new type of connection

944
00:41:28.938 --> 00:41:31.833
between human beings, between men and women,

945
00:41:31.833 --> 00:41:34.110
in friendship, a new kind of partnership

946
00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:37.079
that really has not been given birth to

947
00:41:37.079 --> 00:41:38.381
until this period of time.

948
00:41:38.381 --> 00:41:40.088
Not very often, anyway.

949
00:41:40.088 --> 00:41:42.751
<v ->When it happens spontaneously, you're really fortunate.</v>

950
00:41:42.751 --> 00:41:45.363
And between men and women in the past,

951
00:41:45.363 --> 00:41:47.023
very, very difficult.

952
00:41:47.023 --> 00:41:49.925
The women were programmed into a different role,

953
00:41:49.925 --> 00:41:54.730
certainly marriage, remember the old phrase wedlock?

954
00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:57.199
The bonds of marriage?

955
00:41:57.199 --> 00:41:59.868
I got married in '51, that was the ceremony

956
00:41:59.868 --> 00:42:01.237
Today when people do get married,

957
00:42:01.237 --> 00:42:02.938
they make up their own vows.

958
00:42:02.938 --> 00:42:04.407
Most women wouldn't say that.

959
00:42:04.407 --> 00:42:06.575
<v Regina>Right.</v>

960
00:42:06.575 --> 00:42:08.411
No less the obey portion.

961
00:42:08.411 --> 00:42:09.778
<v ->Obey!</v>

962
00:42:09.778 --> 00:42:11.833
You see, it's changed.

963
00:42:11.833 --> 00:42:13.482
We have to say in the last 50 years,

964
00:42:13.482 --> 00:42:17.213
a huge shift in the feminine consciousness.

965
00:42:18.063 --> 00:42:21.524
What I sense is that when the feminine

966
00:42:21.524 --> 00:42:24.126
begins to turn on to her deeper life purpose,

967
00:42:24.126 --> 00:42:27.730
her vocation, it's an unknown quantity

968
00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:30.926
because it doesn't have the job, the label,

969
00:42:30.926 --> 00:42:33.370
it's not a professional status often.

970
00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:37.206
She may be very professional in her capability, or not.

971
00:42:37.206 --> 00:42:39.808
See I just graduated from motherhood

972
00:42:39.808 --> 00:42:41.464
to being an evolutionary.

973
00:42:41.464 --> 00:42:44.080
I didn't have a professional period,

974
00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:47.399
which is, in a way a loss, because it would have been good.

975
00:42:47.399 --> 00:42:49.285
But I had 20 years of five children,

976
00:42:49.285 --> 00:42:52.521
so my profession was motherhood.

977
00:42:52.521 --> 00:42:55.858
Then I jumped to being an evolutionary woman.

978
00:42:55.858 --> 00:42:58.560
So, the women, I believe,

979
00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:02.131
have vocational arousal en masse,

980
00:43:02.131 --> 00:43:04.934
that when they say yes to it,

981
00:43:04.934 --> 00:43:07.469
and they follow that inner compass,

982
00:43:07.469 --> 00:43:11.495
they seek their partners and they can be...

983
00:43:11.495 --> 00:43:14.443
It's not homosexual, bisexual, transsexual,

984
00:43:14.443 --> 00:43:16.245
it's suprasexual.

985
00:43:16.245 --> 00:43:17.846
So, I think we don't need

986
00:43:17.846 --> 00:43:20.349
to come out of the closet as gay or straight,

987
00:43:20.349 --> 00:43:23.351
but come out of the closet as whole. (laughs)

988
00:43:23.351 --> 00:43:25.221
<v Regina>Yes. (laughs)</v>

989
00:43:25.221 --> 00:43:29.898
<v ->Come out of the closet as what I call a universal human.</v>

990
00:43:29.898 --> 00:43:34.325
So I'm a very young, universal human.

991
00:43:34.325 --> 00:43:35.831
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

992
00:43:35.831 --> 00:43:40.035
<v ->Joining millions of others, because we're all young</v>

993
00:43:40.035 --> 00:43:43.606
in that the culture that could fully receive us

994
00:43:43.606 --> 00:43:45.307
is what we have to create.

995
00:43:45.307 --> 00:43:46.742
<v Regine>Yes.</v>

996
00:43:46.742 --> 00:43:48.911
Let's talk men into this part of it now,

997
00:43:48.911 --> 00:43:50.713
that's the feminine part of it.

998
00:43:50.713 --> 00:43:52.380
What's happening with the men

999
00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.517
and how are they folding themselves

1000
00:43:54.517 --> 00:43:57.720
into this really completely new paradigm

1001
00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:00.656
from the way they've been experiencing their own life

1002
00:44:00.656 --> 00:44:04.486
and essentially creating their own lives?

1003
00:44:05.316 --> 00:44:08.831
<v ->In my experience, the best men I know</v>

1004
00:44:08.831 --> 00:44:11.600
are yearning for this to happen.

1005
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:14.369
The best men in the world,

1006
00:44:14.369 --> 00:44:17.928
know that more of the same,

1007
00:44:17.928 --> 00:44:22.638
more of the same at the structural power center, will fail.

1008
00:44:23.088 --> 00:44:25.281
Even if they're in the power structure.

1009
00:44:25.281 --> 00:44:29.738
But the ones that have left being at the top of something,

1010
00:44:29.738 --> 00:44:31.520
who are seeking,

1011
00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.955
actually are much more confused than the women.

1012
00:44:33.955 --> 00:44:35.497
<v Regina>That's what I was going to ask,</v>

1013
00:44:35.497 --> 00:44:38.360
we're drawing upon something instinctive from the feminine.

1014
00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:38.885
<v ->Yes.</v>

1015
00:44:38.885 --> 00:44:42.064
<v Regina>What are they drawing upon, from your experience?</v>

1016
00:44:42.064 --> 00:44:43.098
<v ->See that's a very good point.</v>

1017
00:44:43.098 --> 00:44:46.468
The women, because we don't have a social pattern,

1018
00:44:46.468 --> 00:44:47.737
particularly for the older women

1019
00:44:47.737 --> 00:44:50.239
and the women who are not having children,

1020
00:44:50.239 --> 00:44:52.725
or who have very few children.

1021
00:44:52.725 --> 00:44:56.212
We don't have a cultural imprint to get over.

1022
00:44:56.212 --> 00:44:58.413
And the 50 or 60 years of the women's movement

1023
00:44:58.413 --> 00:45:02.785
had liberated us, but not just to be equal to men.

1024
00:45:02.785 --> 00:45:06.322
To be co-creators, that's what we're liberated to.

1025
00:45:06.322 --> 00:45:10.192
The men obviously have within them

1026
00:45:10.192 --> 00:45:13.496
their own essential spiritual creativity.

1027
00:45:13.496 --> 00:45:17.893
But the structures of the patriarchy and the success models

1028
00:45:17.893 --> 00:45:22.371
that men are trained to, make it harder for them.

1029
00:45:22.371 --> 00:45:24.940
And what really works for the men I have found,

1030
00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:26.891
and it's very tricky in here,

1031
00:45:26.891 --> 00:45:28.981
is if the woman

1032
00:45:28.981 --> 00:45:31.881
who's vocationally aroused and loving,

1033
00:45:31.881 --> 00:45:36.515
because it's a loving urge, it's not a dominating urge,

1034
00:45:36.515 --> 00:45:40.656
loves and needs the creativity of the male,

1035
00:45:40.656 --> 00:45:42.824
she liberates him.

1036
00:45:42.824 --> 00:45:44.526
Tim Leary said to me years ago

1037
00:45:44.526 --> 00:45:47.038
"Men do what women want."

1038
00:45:47.038 --> 00:45:49.831
What women like myself really want

1039
00:45:49.831 --> 00:45:51.199
is co-creative partnership.

1040
00:45:51.199 --> 00:45:51.967
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1041
00:45:51.967 --> 00:45:54.386
<v ->We yearn for the men</v>

1042
00:45:54.386 --> 00:45:57.226
to access their own essential self

1043
00:45:57.226 --> 00:46:00.242
and be able to use the strength of the masculine,

1044
00:46:00.242 --> 00:46:02.410
which is different than the strength of the feminine.

1045
00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:05.420
There's no doubt, men are builders.

1046
00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:08.049
Men have a capacity for form,

1047
00:46:08.049 --> 00:46:10.085
that many of us don't have.

1048
00:46:10.085 --> 00:46:13.555
And I have loved it in my life when I've had

1049
00:46:13.555 --> 00:46:15.724
the male partners and partnering,

1050
00:46:15.724 --> 00:46:17.960
not necessarily romantic partners,

1051
00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:20.128
there's nothing greater

1052
00:46:20.128 --> 00:46:23.933
than the evolving woman with the evolving men

1053
00:46:23.933 --> 00:46:26.467
together forming evolving work.

1054
00:46:26.467 --> 00:46:27.270
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1055
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:31.136
<v ->It's more exciting than having a family.</v>

1056
00:46:31.136 --> 00:46:31.840
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1057
00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.376
<v ->It's more exciting for many of us</v>

1058
00:46:34.376 --> 00:46:36.578
than having a lot of babies.

1059
00:46:36.578 --> 00:46:39.547
Maybe you have a chosen child or no child.

1060
00:46:39.547 --> 00:46:42.218
But the real passion now for the world

1061
00:46:42.218 --> 00:46:44.954
is expression of joy and creativity.

1062
00:46:44.954 --> 00:46:49.514
So the women's, the evolutionary woman

1063
00:46:49.514 --> 00:46:51.627
she yearns for the evolutionary man,

1064
00:46:51.627 --> 00:46:53.411
and that helps to liberate him--

1065
00:46:53.411 --> 00:46:54.613
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1066
00:46:55.723 --> 00:46:57.365
And my experience is very similar to yours,

1067
00:46:57.365 --> 00:47:00.635
I loved my little baby Stuart, my son,

1068
00:47:00.635 --> 00:47:02.772
more than anything, more than life itself,

1069
00:47:02.772 --> 00:47:05.507
but I too, found myself falling into depression

1070
00:47:05.507 --> 00:47:07.076
because there was something trying to emerge.

1071
00:47:07.076 --> 00:47:08.877
And that's the time when I started

1072
00:47:08.877 --> 00:47:11.614
becoming much more seriously involved

1073
00:47:11.614 --> 00:47:13.281
in these lines of inquiry,

1074
00:47:13.281 --> 00:47:15.184
was just after his birth.

1075
00:47:15.184 --> 00:47:16.652
<v ->In what period of history?</v>

1076
00:47:16.652 --> 00:47:18.487
<v Regina>That would've been in the early 80's.</v>

1077
00:47:18.487 --> 00:47:19.254
<v ->The early 80's.</v>

1078
00:47:19.254 --> 00:47:20.923
<v Regina>1982 is when he was born.</v>

1079
00:47:20.923 --> 00:47:25.260
'83, '84, '85 I couldn't ask enough questions.

1080
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.663
I couldn't have enough meditative time

1081
00:47:27.663 --> 00:47:30.332
and get enough answers.

1082
00:47:31.732 --> 00:47:33.402
Almost couldn't get enough to satisfy me

1083
00:47:33.402 --> 00:47:35.235
and bring me out of that feeling.

1084
00:47:35.235 --> 00:47:36.938
And ultimately it settled down

1085
00:47:36.938 --> 00:47:39.909
and propelled me on an entirely new path using media

1086
00:47:39.909 --> 00:47:41.009
for my own purposes,

1087
00:47:41.009 --> 00:47:43.378
which I've been doing since the mid 80's.

1088
00:47:43.378 --> 00:47:45.246
I stopped traditional media by then.

1089
00:47:45.246 --> 00:47:49.067
<v ->So, you are a perfect example of an evolutionary woman.</v>

1090
00:47:49.067 --> 00:47:50.352
A feminine co-creator.

1091
00:47:50.352 --> 00:47:52.707
You followed that internal signal,

1092
00:47:52.707 --> 00:47:54.723
you know the joy of motherhood,

1093
00:47:54.723 --> 00:47:57.126
but you know that it goes beyond that

1094
00:47:57.126 --> 00:47:58.994
and you include the child.

1095
00:47:58.994 --> 00:47:59.662
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1096
00:47:59.662 --> 00:48:01.497
<v ->And just to speak of that for a moment,</v>

1097
00:48:01.497 --> 00:48:04.135
I believe that the evolving woman

1098
00:48:04.135 --> 00:48:05.568
who's able to say yes to this

1099
00:48:05.568 --> 00:48:07.836
and continues to love her children,

1100
00:48:07.836 --> 00:48:12.707
gives the children a model of the evolving human.

1101
00:48:12.707 --> 00:48:17.179
And my children gave me a party when I was 50,

1102
00:48:17.179 --> 00:48:20.383
and I said to them "What did I do well as a mother,

1103
00:48:20.383 --> 00:48:22.318
"And what did I do badly?"

1104
00:48:22.318 --> 00:48:24.419
And what I did well as a mother

1105
00:48:24.419 --> 00:48:27.935
was follow my own deeper life purpose,

1106
00:48:27.935 --> 00:48:32.381
because every single child, five out of five, has vocation.

1107
00:48:33.201 --> 00:48:36.865
And the model of the woman doing this,

1108
00:48:36.865 --> 00:48:39.957
I have three daughters and two sons,

1109
00:48:39.957 --> 00:48:42.103
they all are like this.

1110
00:48:42.103 --> 00:48:43.605
And what I didn't do well,

1111
00:48:43.605 --> 00:48:46.975
and this was in the 60's when I became so excited,

1112
00:48:46.975 --> 00:48:50.812
is I didn't know how to say no well enough.

1113
00:48:50.812 --> 00:48:53.681
That 60's mother, I became the evolutionary woman.

1114
00:48:53.681 --> 00:48:54.483
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1115
00:48:54.483 --> 00:48:56.638
<v ->The 50's I was there full time,</v>

1116
00:48:56.638 --> 00:48:59.628
but sort of depressed.

1117
00:48:59.628 --> 00:49:01.624
Then when I woke up,

1118
00:49:01.624 --> 00:49:03.625
I took all the children to Washington, DC.

1119
00:49:03.625 --> 00:49:05.464
<v Regina>(laughs)</v>

1120
00:49:05.464 --> 00:49:08.733
<v ->I got a divorce, I formed the Committee for the Future,</v>

1121
00:49:08.733 --> 00:49:11.029
the children all did their thing. (laughs)

1122
00:49:11.029 --> 00:49:12.401
<v Regina>(laughs)</v>

1123
00:49:12.401 --> 00:49:16.705
<v ->And I think that as a mother, if I'd been slightly more</v>

1124
00:49:16.705 --> 00:49:19.374
aware I would have been guiding them better.

1125
00:49:19.374 --> 00:49:20.842
But they all turned out wonderfully.

1126
00:49:20.842 --> 00:49:22.377
<v Regina>Well yeah, that was already,</v>

1127
00:49:22.377 --> 00:49:24.346
that was already given birth to within them

1128
00:49:24.346 --> 00:49:25.981
from the earliest years.

1129
00:49:25.981 --> 00:49:27.749
That had been set.
<v Barbara>Yes.</v>

1130
00:49:27.749 --> 00:49:28.917
<v Barbara>They had a good start.</v>

1131
00:49:28.917 --> 00:49:31.298
<v Regina>And we have a wonderful raven,</v>

1132
00:49:31.298 --> 00:49:34.022
it's trying to join our conversation (laughs)

1133
00:49:34.022 --> 00:49:35.290
validating what you're saying,

1134
00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:37.892
for anyone wondering what that sound is in the background.

1135
00:49:37.892 --> 00:49:40.538
But you'd already done that, that was instilled.

1136
00:49:40.538 --> 00:49:41.396
<v ->That's very true.</v>

1137
00:49:41.396 --> 00:49:43.899
So by the mother, and this would be

1138
00:49:43.899 --> 00:49:46.134
for all women who feel that maybe their role

1139
00:49:46.134 --> 00:49:48.537
is to stay exactly as they've been,

1140
00:49:48.537 --> 00:49:52.714
know for the sake of the children,

1141
00:49:52.714 --> 00:49:55.743
even your own children much less the children of the world,

1142
00:49:55.743 --> 00:49:58.379
is for the woman to say yes

1143
00:49:58.379 --> 00:50:01.517
to that inner passion to express herself.

1144
00:50:01.517 --> 00:50:02.851
<v Regina>Follow it.</v>

1145
00:50:04.061 --> 00:50:07.058
<v ->Follow that inner script.</v>

1146
00:50:07.058 --> 00:50:10.191
Maintain your love of your children,

1147
00:50:10.191 --> 00:50:14.762
and the most difficult part is the relationship with a man

1148
00:50:14.762 --> 00:50:17.833
if the woman is vocationally aroused.

1149
00:50:17.833 --> 00:50:20.643
I had a talk with my friend Gay Hendricks,

1150
00:50:20.643 --> 00:50:23.005
who's quite sophisticated with Katie

1151
00:50:23.005 --> 00:50:25.507
on the subject of relationship.

1152
00:50:25.507 --> 00:50:29.545
And I said to Gay "What happens to the man

1153
00:50:29.545 --> 00:50:33.551
"When the woman not just awakens or has a nice job,

1154
00:50:33.551 --> 00:50:37.251
"But the woman is passionately aroused

1155
00:50:37.251 --> 00:50:39.821
"By her own expression, what happens to the man?"

1156
00:50:39.821 --> 00:50:43.024
He said "It's very difficult,

1157
00:50:43.024 --> 00:50:46.128
"Because the men are genetically programmed

1158
00:50:46.128 --> 00:50:49.461
"To be the protector, to be the one."

1159
00:50:49.461 --> 00:50:52.740
(raven calling loudly)

1160
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:59.407
The younger men probably can do this

1161
00:50:59.407 --> 00:51:01.743
because they expect this of the women.

1162
00:51:01.743 --> 00:51:05.764
The older men of my generation,

1163
00:51:05.764 --> 00:51:09.218
it has been very difficult for every man I've loved.

1164
00:51:09.218 --> 00:51:11.686
<v Regina>Yes, I can understand that.</v>

1165
00:51:11.686 --> 00:51:16.191
<v ->And what tends to happen to the woman</v>

1166
00:51:16.191 --> 00:51:20.395
is she instinctively dampens down that creativity

1167
00:51:20.395 --> 00:51:22.797
because if she let it out the whole way

1168
00:51:22.797 --> 00:51:24.732
nobody can stand her.

1169
00:51:24.732 --> 00:51:27.502
Men feel displaced.

1170
00:51:27.502 --> 00:51:29.070
Now that's not true of all men,

1171
00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:30.305
it's not true of the younger men

1172
00:51:30.305 --> 00:51:33.943
cuz they know that this is true of women.

1173
00:51:33.943 --> 00:51:38.316
But for the older generation who is still here,

1174
00:51:38.316 --> 00:51:40.521
it's hard for the men.

1175
00:51:41.781 --> 00:51:43.451
It's harder for the men than the women right now.

1176
00:51:43.451 --> 00:51:44.319
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1177
00:51:44.319 --> 00:51:45.411
Well and as you say,

1178
00:51:45.411 --> 00:51:47.055
that's changing though, that's evolving.

1179
00:51:47.055 --> 00:51:50.223
My son and his friends, that generation, it's different.

1180
00:51:50.223 --> 00:51:51.712
<v ->It's different.
<v Regina>They expect that.</v>

1181
00:51:51.712 --> 00:51:54.496
<v ->So, the people who are in supposedly</v>

1182
00:51:54.496 --> 00:51:58.069
knowing what is going on on earth.

1183
00:51:59.009 --> 00:52:02.304
The baby boomers who are going into their 60's and 70's,

1184
00:52:02.304 --> 00:52:04.005
and there's gonna be this huge flood

1185
00:52:04.005 --> 00:52:06.635
of older people by the way,

1186
00:52:07.605 --> 00:52:12.448
that generation was imprinted with this,

1187
00:52:12.448 --> 00:52:14.950
even if they had a lot of liberation,

1188
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:18.393
which I had a lot of liberation and so did the men,

1189
00:52:18.393 --> 00:52:20.999
but when I became so aroused,

1190
00:52:20.999 --> 00:52:23.491
I could see what happened, it hurt every man I loved.

1191
00:52:23.491 --> 00:52:25.060
<v Regina>Yes, I understand that.</v>

1192
00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:27.638
<v ->And I didn't know how to do that.</v>

1193
00:52:27.638 --> 00:52:28.763
<v Regina>So, that's a journey each one of us</v>

1194
00:52:28.763 --> 00:52:30.699
simply has to find our way through.

1195
00:52:30.699 --> 00:52:31.279
<v ->Yes.</v>

1196
00:52:31.279 --> 00:52:32.547
<v Regina>That's a very private,</v>

1197
00:52:32.547 --> 00:52:33.702
in that sense it's a private,

1198
00:52:33.702 --> 00:52:34.735
we're going through it collectively

1199
00:52:34.735 --> 00:52:36.105
but it's a very private journey

1200
00:52:36.105 --> 00:52:38.339
in terms of how we contend with it.

1201
00:52:38.339 --> 00:52:39.251
<v ->It's true.</v>

1202
00:52:39.251 --> 00:52:40.442
<v Regina>The one thing it seems to me,</v>

1203
00:52:40.442 --> 00:52:42.211
is what you just touched on,

1204
00:52:42.211 --> 00:52:46.050
the women can no longer afford to dampen down any longer,

1205
00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:47.549
that's not serving anyone anymore.

1206
00:52:47.549 --> 00:52:52.086
<v ->No, and the best men love them for it</v>

1207
00:52:52.086 --> 00:52:55.039
so that you don't have to be aggressive.

1208
00:52:56.059 --> 00:52:59.060
It's like the early Black Power movement in this country,

1209
00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:00.896
they had to be aggressive.

1210
00:53:00.896 --> 00:53:03.065
But look at President Obama,

1211
00:53:03.065 --> 00:53:05.937
the last thing he needs to be is aggressive.

1212
00:53:05.937 --> 00:53:07.635
He's so powerful!

1213
00:53:07.635 --> 00:53:10.405
And when they want him to be more angry (laughs)

1214
00:53:10.405 --> 00:53:13.575
or more upset, in fact he's not.

1215
00:53:13.575 --> 00:53:15.177
He's higher than that.

1216
00:53:15.177 --> 00:53:17.752
He's tryin' to see how to make this work,

1217
00:53:17.752 --> 00:53:20.530
but he's stuck in a pyramidal structure.

1218
00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:21.282
<v Regina>Oh, yes indeed.</v>

1219
00:53:21.282 --> 00:53:24.653
<v ->Which is oppositional in the US democracy.</v>

1220
00:53:24.653 --> 00:53:26.064
<v Regina>The structure doesn't work.</v>

1221
00:53:26.064 --> 00:53:28.504
<v ->So no matter who you are,</v>

1222
00:53:28.504 --> 00:53:30.497
even if you're one of the greatest unifiers

1223
00:53:30.497 --> 00:53:33.027
on earth by your nature,

1224
00:53:33.027 --> 00:53:36.264
you get up in there, you can't do it.

1225
00:53:36.264 --> 00:53:38.400
So, the men either have to come down

1226
00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:42.804
out of those structures, which is harder in a way,

1227
00:53:42.804 --> 00:53:44.583
cuz the women in general,

1228
00:53:44.583 --> 00:53:47.397
we're not in them, you see.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1229
00:53:48.187 --> 00:53:50.303
<v Regina>Yes, well I know we don't have</v>

1230
00:53:50.303 --> 00:53:53.520
a lot of time left together here so I wanna get to 2012.

1231
00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:54.182
<v ->Oh yes!</v>

1232
00:53:54.182 --> 00:53:55.918
<v Regina>And what's happening, this is interesting,</v>

1233
00:53:55.918 --> 00:53:59.003
we're at a 2012 Tipping Point Conference,

1234
00:53:59.003 --> 00:54:02.724
but for you personally, you have been invited,

1235
00:54:02.724 --> 00:54:04.153
and I'd like you to tell that little story

1236
00:54:04.153 --> 00:54:04.893
and tie it together,

1237
00:54:04.893 --> 00:54:07.403
you've been invited to do something

1238
00:54:07.403 --> 00:54:11.800
very essential to your being on your birthday,

1239
00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:16.404
the day after, on December 22nd of 2012.

1240
00:54:16.404 --> 00:54:18.740
And if you would, please talk about that for just a moment,

1241
00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:21.609
cuz I know we have only a few moments left.

1242
00:54:21.609 --> 00:54:23.612
<v ->I'm just thinking of that phrase, the day after,</v>

1243
00:54:23.612 --> 00:54:25.873
you know there was a movie The Day After,

1244
00:54:25.873 --> 00:54:28.410
it was the day after a nuclear holocaust.

1245
00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:31.052
The day after December 21st,

1246
00:54:31.052 --> 00:54:34.642
which is supposedly the end of the long calendar,

1247
00:54:34.642 --> 00:54:36.714
is December 22nd.

1248
00:54:36.714 --> 00:54:41.462
And my friend, Michael Tanner, has asked me on day one,

1249
00:54:41.462 --> 00:54:44.966
which is December 22nd, 2012,

1250
00:54:44.966 --> 00:54:49.459
to be part of a very large event which he's planning.

1251
00:54:49.459 --> 00:54:51.972
To actually...

1252
00:54:51.972 --> 00:54:54.742
He's calling it a birthing moment.

1253
00:54:54.742 --> 00:54:59.147
A birthing experience of humanity feeling itself,

1254
00:54:59.147 --> 00:55:03.347
to be one body, to be whole, to be connected,

1255
00:55:03.347 --> 00:55:06.817
and that this is to be a global,

1256
00:55:06.817 --> 00:55:09.567
multimedia experience

1257
00:55:09.567 --> 00:55:13.895
of a planetary birthing for humanity,

1258
00:55:13.895 --> 00:55:17.223
that I have been asked to do

1259
00:55:17.223 --> 00:55:20.302
on my birthday, December 22nd--

1260
00:55:20.302 --> 00:55:22.086
<v Regina>No coincidences there.</v>

1261
00:55:22.086 --> 00:55:23.672
<v ->2012.</v>

1262
00:55:23.672 --> 00:55:26.041
<v Regina>The very thing, that message you received</v>

1263
00:55:26.041 --> 00:55:27.642
all those years ago.

1264
00:55:27.642 --> 00:55:29.344
<v ->That's why I say to people,</v>

1265
00:55:29.344 --> 00:55:31.446
if you're a visionary, don't die.

1266
00:55:31.446 --> 00:55:32.980
<v Regina>(laughs) Don't die!</v>

1267
00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:34.199
Number one just don't die

1268
00:55:34.199 --> 00:55:36.181
so you can stay in it and see it through.

1269
00:55:36.181 --> 00:55:40.789
<v ->No, here's what I see about that event,</v>

1270
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:44.058
we're here at a conference 2012 Tipping Point.

1271
00:55:44.058 --> 00:55:48.535
There are countless people, activities and celebrations

1272
00:55:48.535 --> 00:55:51.135
and events being planned.

1273
00:55:51.135 --> 00:55:55.620
I see the need for a coordinating hub again.

1274
00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:58.420
Where, (coughs) excuse me.

1275
00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:00.908
I see a need for a coordinating hub

1276
00:56:00.908 --> 00:56:02.576
where all of those activities

1277
00:56:02.576 --> 00:56:05.113
that want to express themselves

1278
00:56:05.113 --> 00:56:08.016
would have a place to just say what they're doing.

1279
00:56:08.016 --> 00:56:09.522
And it would be self-organizing,

1280
00:56:09.522 --> 00:56:12.321
nobody's trying to coordinate other people

1281
00:56:12.321 --> 00:56:16.023
but it will be self-organizing into a pattern.

1282
00:56:16.023 --> 00:56:17.625
I feel sure of that.

1283
00:56:17.625 --> 00:56:21.252
And this experience I had of the round room

1284
00:56:21.252 --> 00:56:24.149
with all the screens (chuckles)

1285
00:56:24.149 --> 00:56:28.459
should exist by 2012.

1286
00:56:28.459 --> 00:56:32.036
It should be obvious to humanity

1287
00:56:32.036 --> 00:56:35.470
that that room can exist and be replicated anywhere,

1288
00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:38.789
cuz it's TV, it's actually internet screens.

1289
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:41.916
But it has to be shown to be visible.

1290
00:56:41.916 --> 00:56:46.321
And so, I've been asked to realize my life purpose

1291
00:56:46.321 --> 00:56:49.151
on December 22nd, 2012

1292
00:56:49.151 --> 00:56:52.359
by participating in an experience

1293
00:56:52.359 --> 00:56:54.129
of our planetary birth,

1294
00:56:54.129 --> 00:56:56.577
where enough of us come into resonance,

1295
00:56:56.577 --> 00:57:00.361
connect, feel the light, get lifted up

1296
00:57:00.361 --> 00:57:03.387
and be receptive to higher intelligence,

1297
00:57:03.387 --> 00:57:05.107
however it comes in.

1298
00:57:05.107 --> 00:57:09.178
<v Regina>And I believe you are the keynote or the first,</v>

1299
00:57:09.178 --> 00:57:12.480
are you presenting at this to open this whole ceremony?

1300
00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:13.415
<v ->Yes,</v>

1301
00:57:13.415 --> 00:57:16.352
That it would be a global multimedia again,

1302
00:57:16.352 --> 00:57:19.788
from Phoenix, Arizona where Michael Tanner

1303
00:57:19.788 --> 00:57:23.590
is also having big events about the reunion

1304
00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:25.461
of all the different religions,

1305
00:57:25.461 --> 00:57:28.329
doing a trilogy on the Phoenix Lights.

1306
00:57:28.329 --> 00:57:33.004
The Phoenix Lights were sightings over Phoenix, Arizona

1307
00:57:33.354 --> 00:57:36.570
and the possibility

1308
00:57:36.570 --> 00:57:39.680
of us not being alone in the universe.

1309
00:57:40.570 --> 00:57:44.059
His belief, (coughs) excuse me.

1310
00:57:45.279 --> 00:57:49.584
His belief is that, and my belief too,

1311
00:57:49.584 --> 00:57:52.253
to the degree that we are resonant

1312
00:57:52.253 --> 00:57:54.556
and we are lifted up together

1313
00:57:54.556 --> 00:57:58.306
to our own higher consciousness together,

1314
00:57:58.306 --> 00:58:01.196
will lift us up to be receptive

1315
00:58:01.196 --> 00:58:03.432
to that which is coming towards us,

1316
00:58:03.432 --> 00:58:07.468
and we're like a newborn baby crying right now.

1317
00:58:07.468 --> 00:58:09.671
We might be surrounded by life,

1318
00:58:09.671 --> 00:58:13.942
but until we pause, breathe,

1319
00:58:13.942 --> 00:58:17.535
and open our collective eyes, we won't know.

1320
00:58:17.535 --> 00:58:18.112
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1321
00:58:18.112 --> 00:58:21.015
<v ->So, I am feeling I'm participating</v>

1322
00:58:21.015 --> 00:58:24.722
in an event of a planetary birth, actually.

1323
00:58:25.252 --> 00:58:28.847
<v Regina>Indeed, it's almost literal and Barbara,</v>

1324
00:58:28.847 --> 00:58:30.391
I thank you for the decades

1325
00:58:30.391 --> 00:58:33.128
of paving the way for so many individuals

1326
00:58:33.128 --> 00:58:35.863
and for having the sheer nerve

1327
00:58:35.863 --> 00:58:37.298
to do some of what you've done

1328
00:58:37.298 --> 00:58:39.901
in order to be able to take your work this far.

1329
00:58:39.901 --> 00:58:43.724
If it hadn't been for your incredible level of,

1330
00:58:43.724 --> 00:58:45.407
whether it was intentional or not,

1331
00:58:45.407 --> 00:58:46.518
a type of confidence

1332
00:58:46.518 --> 00:58:49.610
and it goes beyond what most humans feel they possess,

1333
00:58:49.610 --> 00:58:50.578
you did it anyway.

1334
00:58:50.578 --> 00:58:52.448
You knocked on doors, you've asked questions

1335
00:58:52.448 --> 00:58:55.795
and you've been doing it for what, 50 years!

1336
00:58:55.795 --> 00:58:56.250
<v ->I have.</v>

1337
00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:57.848
<v Regina>On behalf of all of us,</v>

1338
00:58:57.848 --> 00:59:01.111
to culminate in this event on December 22nd--

1339
00:59:01.111 --> 00:59:02.269
<v ->It's really amazing.</v>

1340
00:59:02.269 --> 00:59:03.925
<v Regina>2012, which is just amazing,</v>

1341
00:59:03.925 --> 00:59:06.864
and I for one will be part of it in whatever way

1342
00:59:06.864 --> 00:59:09.263
Scott and I can contribute to that as well.

1343
00:59:09.263 --> 00:59:12.549
And I thank you so much for a lifetime of beautiful work

1344
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:14.640
and we look forward to that day together.

1345
00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:15.989
<v ->Thank you. (laughs)</v>

1346
00:59:15.989 --> 00:59:17.466
Beautiful.

1347
00:59:18.907 --> 00:59:20.809
<v ->You can pick up a copy of Barbara's film,</v>

1348
00:59:20.809 --> 00:59:23.471
Visions of a Universal Humanity, by going to

1349
00:59:23.471 --> 00:59:25.780
humanityascending.com.

1350
00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:28.149
Meanwhile, you might also enjoy my conversations

1351
00:59:28.149 --> 00:59:31.620
with Michael Tsarion, Christine Page and Lucia Rene

1352
00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:33.788
on the resurgence of feminine knowledge.

1353
00:59:33.788 --> 00:59:36.186
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1354
00:59:36.186 --> 00:59:41.018
(introspective music finale)
