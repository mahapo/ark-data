00:00:00.505 --> 00:00:03.662
<v ->Vernon Wolfe is a man who is here to change the world,</v>

2
00:00:03.662 --> 00:00:05.283
and he has repeatedly put his money

3
00:00:05.283 --> 00:00:07.016
and time where his mouth is.

4
00:00:07.096 --> 00:00:09.347
His work helped tranform the Soviet Union

5
00:00:09.347 --> 00:00:12.600
from the Cold War culture to a peace time culture.

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.224
He stands beside Palestinians and Israelis and helps

7
00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:16.845
them come face to face,

8
00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:18.861
and transform their hatred of one another

9
00:00:18.861 --> 00:00:21.005
into respect and even love.

10
00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:22.861
Meanwhile he helps the rest of us

11
00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:24.951
find our true, fullest potential

12
00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:27.985
from within our multidimensional mind and spirit.

13
00:00:28.247 --> 00:00:29.783
One of the grandfathers of science

14
00:00:29.783 --> 00:00:32.151
and consciousness, with a background in physics,

15
00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:35.190
religious studies, and developmental therapy,

16
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.836
Vernon has the countenance of Santa Claus.

17
00:00:37.836 --> 00:00:39.734
With a twinkle in his eye he strips

18
00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:42.315
away our illusions and introduces us

19
00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:43.707
to ourselves.

20
00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:57.941
Vern, you have become known as in essence

21
00:00:57.941 --> 00:01:01.514
a guru of problem solving

22
00:01:01.514 --> 00:01:03.679
on a very grand scale,

23
00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:06.879
all the way from individuals to governments,

24
00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:08.767
and this could not have been

25
00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:10.570
an obvious sort of path that

26
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.892
took you in this direction.

27
00:01:11.892 --> 00:01:14.655
Can you just tell us a little bit about

28
00:01:14.655 --> 00:01:16.841
your background hop scotching though

29
00:01:16.841 --> 00:01:19.646
your original studies that led you to the next,

30
00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:21.513
to the next, and it'll be obvious in about

31
00:01:21.513 --> 00:01:23.113
two sentences how you got to where

32
00:01:23.113 --> 00:01:24.297
you are right now.

33
00:01:24.297 --> 00:01:25.897
<v ->As long as I can clarify that guru</v>

34
00:01:25.897 --> 00:01:27.912
means G-U-R-

35
00:01:27.912 --> 00:01:28.776
U
<v Voiceover>U,</v>

36
00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:29.427
that's right.

37
00:01:29.427 --> 00:01:30.749
<v ->I can go along.
<v Voiceover>That's right.</v>

38
00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:32.711
<v ->I began</v>

39
00:01:32.835 --> 00:01:34.232
by taking physics,

40
00:01:34.232 --> 00:01:35.853
the hardest classes that I could find

41
00:01:35.853 --> 00:01:38.776
in university, because I wanted to

42
00:01:38.776 --> 00:01:42.236
study premed and the basis of reality.

43
00:01:42.423 --> 00:01:44.279
That was kind of my quest.

44
00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:46.029
I taught science a couple years,

45
00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:48.418
and then I discovered that teaching science

46
00:01:48.418 --> 00:01:51.127
didn't necessarily make that much difference in a person's

47
00:01:51.127 --> 00:01:53.271
life, and I knew there was something more.

48
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:56.166
I went into education,

49
00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:57.591
and then I went into, well,

50
00:01:57.591 --> 00:01:59.030
I guess I did the science and the education

51
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.076
at the same time.

52
00:02:00.076 --> 00:02:02.299
Taught science, and then I went into

53
00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:04.971
religious education,

54
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:07.201
thought well maybe I can do this out of religion.

55
00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:08.811
<v Woman>Starting from the physical realities</v>

56
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:11.386
into the spiritual realities.

57
00:02:11.392 --> 00:02:12.203
<v ->And that was a lot of fun,</v>

58
00:02:12.203 --> 00:02:15.147
and I worked my way through into teaching

59
00:02:15.147 --> 00:02:18.496
the honors classes in science and religion

60
00:02:18.496 --> 00:02:20.629
in Bringenam University,

61
00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.784
and I did that for awhile, and then I got into

62
00:02:22.784 --> 00:02:25.407
consciousness, and I became aware that

63
00:02:25.407 --> 00:02:28.661
as people developed into enlightenment,

64
00:02:28.661 --> 00:02:30.826
and into different phases of their

65
00:02:30.826 --> 00:02:33.418
own spiritual development, there was some

66
00:02:33.418 --> 00:02:36.233
kind of order going on, and I got interested in that,

67
00:02:36.233 --> 00:02:40.990
so I took my my PhD in developmental psychology,

68
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.518
and then I opened up with, I became a marriage

69
00:02:43.518 --> 00:02:46.025
and family therapist and opened up a clinic,

70
00:02:46.025 --> 00:02:49.118
and then I started looking around for things to do

71
00:02:49.118 --> 00:02:51.443
with this, because I had a good therapy practice,

72
00:02:51.443 --> 00:02:54.227
and I was applying some of the things from quantum physics

73
00:02:54.227 --> 00:02:57.405
and developmental psychology together into the school

74
00:02:57.405 --> 00:02:59.255
of consciousness.

75
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:00.979
<v Woman>And this was at a really early stage in the</v>

76
00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:03.026
game where not a lot of people were talking about the

77
00:03:03.026 --> 00:03:05.352
words physics and consciousness.

78
00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:06.301
<v ->It was unheard of,</v>

79
00:03:06.301 --> 00:03:08.669
it was like 40 years ago, so it's like,

80
00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:10.546
there were some people talking about it,

81
00:03:10.546 --> 00:03:13.799
but almost nobody had done anything about it.

82
00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:14.962
They didn't know how to apply

83
00:03:14.962 --> 00:03:17.553
to an all new theory, but because of my background

84
00:03:17.553 --> 00:03:19.612
in physics I understood quantum physics.

85
00:03:19.612 --> 00:03:23.015
<v Woman>When you started putting consciousness</v>

86
00:03:23.015 --> 00:03:24.913
and physics together there weren't a lot of

87
00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:27.217
guidebooks back in that time as we just mentioned.

88
00:03:27.217 --> 00:03:29.979
Did you have some mentors who had already

89
00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:33.019
fused the world of science and consciousness,

90
00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.875
maybe from prior times,

91
00:03:34.875 --> 00:03:37.776
prior decades?

92
00:03:37.776 --> 00:03:40.656
<v ->Actually, no.</v>

93
00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:42.491
To be truthful with you, no.

94
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:44.933
David Boem probably comes closest to that,

95
00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:47.344
and maybe David Pete, because they started doing things

96
00:03:47.344 --> 00:03:49.946
that were about science and consciousness,

97
00:03:49.946 --> 00:03:51.450
and I knew them both, and David Pete

98
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.826
wrote the introduction

99
00:03:52.826 --> 00:03:55.290
to my first book on holodynamics,

100
00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.980
and we were together and had lots of conversations,

101
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.249
but I have friends.

102
00:04:02.511 --> 00:04:05.295
I had a think tank who was made up of engineers

103
00:04:05.295 --> 00:04:07.758
and physicists and quantum physicists,

104
00:04:07.758 --> 00:04:10.265
and I was like the consciousness end of things,

105
00:04:10.265 --> 00:04:12.633
so I began to see what would apply.

106
00:04:12.633 --> 00:04:14.766
I took some of the premises of quantum physics,

107
00:04:14.766 --> 00:04:16.616
like here's a few.

108
00:04:16.643 --> 00:04:18.894
One is that everything is connected.

109
00:04:18.894 --> 00:04:21.614
Everything is driven by potential, that's another.

110
00:04:21.614 --> 00:04:23.288
Since everything is connected, and everything

111
00:04:23.288 --> 00:04:25.496
is driven by potential, you had to learn

112
00:04:25.496 --> 00:04:27.074
well how can they be connected and how can they

113
00:04:27.074 --> 00:04:27.842
be driven,

114
00:04:27.842 --> 00:04:30.253
and then I discovered that there are all these dimensions

115
00:04:30.253 --> 00:04:31.277
to reality.

116
00:04:31.277 --> 00:04:33.229
<v Woman>But back then, that wasn't necessarily known</v>

117
00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.714
at least in the body of science

118
00:04:35.714 --> 00:04:37.922
that there were 10, 11 plus dimensions was there?

119
00:04:37.922 --> 00:04:40.074
<v ->No, but we knew that they were there.</v>

120
00:04:40.074 --> 00:04:43.244
Paul Tonsen come along and made this great theory

121
00:04:43.244 --> 00:04:45.516
at Cambridge about

122
00:04:45.516 --> 00:04:48.279
there being, he calls them P brains.

123
00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:50.486
I think it's a great, great way to call that.

124
00:04:50.486 --> 00:04:51.489
<v Woman>But it doesn't mean</v>

125
00:04:51.489 --> 00:04:53.446
P-E-A-B-R-A-I-N?

126
00:04:53.446 --> 00:04:53.696
<v ->No, no</v>

127
00:04:53.696 --> 00:04:54.433
<v Woman>Can you explain it?</v>

128
00:04:54.433 --> 00:04:55.958
<v ->P means the number,</v>

129
00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.750
so P is a number, so it goes like from

130
00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.488
one to say if you believe there's only 10,

131
00:04:59.488 --> 00:05:01.206
it goes from one til 10,

132
00:05:01.206 --> 00:05:02.902
but if there's more then you can add more,

133
00:05:02.902 --> 00:05:05.856
and then there's 10 that we can measure for sure,

134
00:05:05.856 --> 00:05:07.727
and we know there's others,

135
00:05:08.544 --> 00:05:09.941
and then brains,

136
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:12.490
B-R-A-N-E-S,

137
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.692
stands for the

138
00:05:14.954 --> 00:05:15.957
number of dimensions.

139
00:05:15.957 --> 00:05:18.762
It really stands for dimensions, so P

140
00:05:18.762 --> 00:05:19.903
<v Woman>P brain</v>

141
00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.262
<v ->The number of dimensions</v>

142
00:05:21.262 --> 00:05:23.274
<v Woman>So what were you saying about our P brain?</v>

143
00:05:23.274 --> 00:05:26.079
<v ->If you're only using a forebrain world,</v>

144
00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:27.679
you know depth and you know

145
00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:30.516
width and you know height.

146
00:05:30.516 --> 00:05:32.884
That's three, and you can see motion,

147
00:05:32.884 --> 00:05:34.601
so you know there's four dimensions you

148
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:36.526
can see right there.

149
00:05:36.595 --> 00:05:39.395
This is called our space time dimension.

150
00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:41.235
<v Woman>That takes care of four of them,</v>

151
00:05:41.235 --> 00:05:43.454
so it looks like we're about six

152
00:05:43.454 --> 00:05:46.846
to however many shy of our true potential,

153
00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:47.741
and our functioning.

154
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:48.648
Is that where you come in?

155
00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:50.344
<v ->Exactly, because when you understand</v>

156
00:05:50.344 --> 00:05:52.392
what the next, just the next dimension,

157
00:05:52.392 --> 00:05:54.781
if you just take one more dimension

158
00:05:54.781 --> 00:05:56.712
then you can see all kinds of things that you can't

159
00:05:56.712 --> 00:05:59.517
see unless you're understanding that dimension,

160
00:05:59.517 --> 00:06:02.215
and when you take at least 10

161
00:06:02.215 --> 00:06:05.394
you can solve every problem we have,

162
00:06:05.394 --> 00:06:06.892
and it's easy.

163
00:06:07.111 --> 00:06:08.732
<v Woman>We're going to get to that in a moment</v>

164
00:06:08.732 --> 00:06:10.620
and talk about where you went with some of this,

165
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.849
because it's a fascinating journey,

166
00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:14.801
but I just have to ask you this.

167
00:06:14.801 --> 00:06:17.600
You were a young man

168
00:06:18.033 --> 00:06:19.931
when you started seeing the link between

169
00:06:19.931 --> 00:06:22.043
physics and consciousness

170
00:06:22.043 --> 00:06:23.782
a path through religion,

171
00:06:23.782 --> 00:06:26.875
how did this come about in your own head,

172
00:06:26.875 --> 00:06:28.059
because it was

173
00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:30.960
they say there is nothing new under the sun,

174
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.517
but it was original thought.

175
00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:33.951
You didn't have mentors.

176
00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:37.509
<v ->Well I put a lot of things together,</v>

177
00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:39.600
so what I did, I have a background of physics,

178
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.338
so I used all the physics and the chemistry,

179
00:06:41.338 --> 00:06:43.109
and I had a background in premed,

180
00:06:43.109 --> 00:06:44.517
so it's like I used the biology

181
00:06:44.517 --> 00:06:47.375
and then it was my reading habits

182
00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:49.679
that were, because I love to read, and I

183
00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:51.556
can read quite rapidly and understand

184
00:06:51.556 --> 00:06:53.647
what I, because I have the basis for it,

185
00:06:53.647 --> 00:06:55.321
and then I got into all the religion

186
00:06:55.321 --> 00:06:56.665
and the philosophies

187
00:06:56.665 --> 00:07:00.238
and took degrees in them so that I would have them,

188
00:07:00.238 --> 00:07:04.067
and then studied and taught world religions

189
00:07:04.067 --> 00:07:05.646
and comparative religions,

190
00:07:05.646 --> 00:07:08.366
and then science and religion,

191
00:07:08.366 --> 00:07:11.992
and it became, I was able to gather.

192
00:07:11.992 --> 00:07:16.946
My passion was more for how does consciousness emerge?

193
00:07:17.048 --> 00:07:20.674
What's the pattern of how we get more conscious,

194
00:07:20.674 --> 00:07:23.292
more aware, more enlightened,

195
00:07:24.034 --> 00:07:26.519
and so it just became a kind of passion

196
00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:28.471
so I started making charts, and so

197
00:07:28.471 --> 00:07:30.146
<v Woman>Ah, connecting the dots.</v>

198
00:07:30.146 --> 00:07:31.991
You are one of those that connected the dots

199
00:07:31.991 --> 00:07:33.015
early on.
<v ->Right.</v>

200
00:07:33.015 --> 00:07:34.775
I took degrees in these different,

201
00:07:34.775 --> 00:07:36.172
so I took the educators,

202
00:07:36.172 --> 00:07:38.188
my educational thing background of dully

203
00:07:38.188 --> 00:07:39.468
and all the rest of the educators,

204
00:07:39.468 --> 00:07:40.833
and what they were really saying

205
00:07:40.833 --> 00:07:43.526
is how does a student learn?

206
00:07:44.182 --> 00:07:46.379
And they had a lot to say about that,

207
00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:49.334
but when I got into developmental psychology,

208
00:07:49.334 --> 00:07:51.680
people like Piaget and Kolberg,

209
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.814
and these people spent their whole lives

210
00:07:53.814 --> 00:07:58.501
just looking at how people grow and develop,

211
00:07:58.528 --> 00:08:00.874
and so they had these patterns.

212
00:08:00.874 --> 00:08:04.469
To call a developmentalist and all the philosophers,

213
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:08.213
and all the educators, and all the science bases,

214
00:08:08.213 --> 00:08:10.090
and applied it in the framework

215
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.473
of a quantum framework,

216
00:08:12.852 --> 00:08:15.289
and one night I had a dream.

217
00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:18.964
I had researchers working full time to

218
00:08:18.964 --> 00:08:20.585
just bring me information, so I was reading

219
00:08:20.585 --> 00:08:22.441
like five thick books and a least a hundred

220
00:08:22.441 --> 00:08:23.902
articles every week,

221
00:08:23.902 --> 00:08:25.737
and going through everything known

222
00:08:25.737 --> 00:08:28.339
and charting out what the dots were

223
00:08:28.339 --> 00:08:29.619
so they could be connected,

224
00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:31.395
and one night I had a dream,

225
00:08:31.657 --> 00:08:34.392
and in this dream I saw a black box,

226
00:08:34.451 --> 00:08:37.570
and it was Skinner's black box,

227
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.253
and Skinner's intention was that what goes in

228
00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:43.389
and what comes out, that's the only thing important.

229
00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:46.402
You'll never know what happened in between.

230
00:08:46.408 --> 00:08:48.722
And in this dream, just almost

231
00:08:48.722 --> 00:08:52.807
out of just pure, pure curiosity

232
00:08:52.807 --> 00:08:57.430
I peeled off the covering on the black box.

233
00:08:57.522 --> 00:08:58.663
<v Woman>What did you see?</v>

234
00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:02.539
<v ->I saw this magnificent topology of consciousness,</v>

235
00:09:02.993 --> 00:09:06.144
and it included everything I had been studying.

236
00:09:07.334 --> 00:09:10.208
<v Woman>Did that become holodynamics?</v>

237
00:09:10.214 --> 00:09:12.379
<v ->It was one whole dynamic,</v>

238
00:09:12.379 --> 00:09:14.491
and so it became holodynamics,

239
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:17.648
because it showed how all the developmental theorists

240
00:09:17.648 --> 00:09:20.134
whether it's in science or biology

241
00:09:20.134 --> 00:09:22.472
or sociology or psychology or

242
00:09:22.472 --> 00:09:25.522
whatever field or any philosophy,

243
00:09:25.522 --> 00:09:28.322
they all fit within this matrix,

244
00:09:28.328 --> 00:09:32.210
and there were six major sections in the mind model,

245
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.279
and then there was a segment of it

246
00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:37.383
that came from one side to the other

247
00:09:37.383 --> 00:09:40.705
that was for family belief systems,

248
00:09:41.244 --> 00:09:42.588
and here I am a family therapist

249
00:09:42.588 --> 00:09:43.836
that made a lot of sense to me,

250
00:09:43.836 --> 00:09:46.492
but then there's another one that overlapped that was

251
00:09:46.492 --> 00:09:48.544
cultural belief systems,

252
00:09:49.137 --> 00:09:51.014
and I'm thinking what is all this?

253
00:09:51.014 --> 00:09:53.659
And then there's a line that goes between it,

254
00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:55.590
cuts through everything,

255
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.581
and it's called the holodynamic plane,

256
00:09:58.581 --> 00:10:00.731
and this voice said to me, the game

257
00:10:00.731 --> 00:10:04.400
in the brain is mainly on the plane,

258
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.677
and I'm going what does that mean?

259
00:10:06.747 --> 00:10:09.744
For two months I listened to this box

260
00:10:09.744 --> 00:10:12.442
all day long, and it showed me how

261
00:10:12.442 --> 00:10:14.085
everything integrated.

262
00:10:14.085 --> 00:10:15.871
It was an integrative experience.

263
00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:17.637
<v Woman>Unbelievable.</v>

264
00:10:17.637 --> 00:10:19.012
<v ->It's a topology,</v>

265
00:10:19.012 --> 00:10:21.295
mathematical topology, and you know,

266
00:10:21.295 --> 00:10:23.311
you can take a topology of anything,

267
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:25.071
like a jet.

268
00:10:25.071 --> 00:10:26.532
You wanna see how to work,

269
00:10:26.532 --> 00:10:29.465
so you put it in a little wind tunnel,

270
00:10:29.465 --> 00:10:31.417
and then you can make a topology of it

271
00:10:31.417 --> 00:10:32.825
and you can change the shape of it,

272
00:10:32.825 --> 00:10:34.222
and it'll show you what it will be like

273
00:10:34.222 --> 00:10:36.099
if it was this shape or that shape,

274
00:10:36.099 --> 00:10:38.467
but it's always a jet, and so it was

275
00:10:38.467 --> 00:10:41.400
that human consciousness became for me

276
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.811
a model, a topology,

277
00:10:43.811 --> 00:10:45.325
and I call it the mind model.

278
00:10:45.325 --> 00:10:47.160
<v Woman>And it was purely in essence,</v>

279
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.232
you had to have had the background,

280
00:10:50.232 --> 00:10:51.202
you had to of

281
00:10:51.202 --> 00:10:52.642
put the pieces together
<v ->I had to have all the dots.</v>

282
00:10:52.642 --> 00:10:53.685
<v Woman>And the dots already,</v>

283
00:10:53.685 --> 00:10:55.754
but for it to be downloaded comes from the

284
00:10:55.754 --> 00:10:58.815
exact fields that you talk about in

285
00:10:58.815 --> 00:11:01.674
all your work, accessing these higher potentials

286
00:11:01.674 --> 00:11:02.698
within each one of us,

287
00:11:02.698 --> 00:11:05.951
and you're accessing that potential in you at that time.

288
00:11:05.951 --> 00:11:08.809
Can we kind of hop scotch forward a bit

289
00:11:08.809 --> 00:11:10.644
as to what happened when you started working.

290
00:11:10.644 --> 00:11:13.492
I really love the stories about your work

291
00:11:13.492 --> 00:11:15.796
in the prison systems and also

292
00:11:15.796 --> 00:11:18.622
working in the mental hospitals

293
00:11:18.622 --> 00:11:21.971
and what you were able to do with the patients there.

294
00:11:21.971 --> 00:11:23.966
Can you talk a little bit about those days?

295
00:11:23.966 --> 00:11:25.544
<v ->Part of the model showed that there's</v>

296
00:11:25.544 --> 00:11:28.264
a critical choice path that people can make

297
00:11:28.264 --> 00:11:30.355
and it has different dimensions,

298
00:11:30.355 --> 00:11:32.232
but one of the dimensions is physical

299
00:11:32.232 --> 00:11:33.512
and the next ones personal,

300
00:11:33.512 --> 00:11:34.717
and then interpersonal,

301
00:11:34.717 --> 00:11:35.784
and then social,

302
00:11:35.784 --> 00:11:37.757
and then into the living principles,

303
00:11:37.757 --> 00:11:38.856
which most people don't know about,

304
00:11:38.856 --> 00:11:40.711
but everybody knows about things like faith and

305
00:11:40.711 --> 00:11:42.919
love and things, but they don't realize that those

306
00:11:42.919 --> 00:11:45.309
are real informational systems.

307
00:11:45.309 --> 00:11:47.399
They're patterns inside of us,

308
00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:50.396
and then I got into the universal, the great

309
00:11:50.396 --> 00:11:53.041
enlightened minds, but when I started working

310
00:11:53.041 --> 00:11:55.542
with my patients in the center

311
00:11:55.804 --> 00:11:57.169
I found out all you had to do was teach in this

312
00:11:57.169 --> 00:12:00.422
and just like that they could come out of their problems.

313
00:12:00.422 --> 00:12:02.257
<v Woman>And these were people that had pretty</v>

314
00:12:02.257 --> 00:12:03.313
severe problems

315
00:12:03.313 --> 00:12:04.262
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

316
00:12:04.262 --> 00:12:05.090
<v Woman>And had been committed into</v>

317
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:05.864
the facility,

318
00:12:05.864 --> 00:12:08.701
<v ->Not at first, but then what happened is</v>

319
00:12:08.701 --> 00:12:10.163
the ones that found out,

320
00:12:10.163 --> 00:12:12.093
they started saying, well what can we do to use this,

321
00:12:12.093 --> 00:12:13.928
and they started picking projects,

322
00:12:13.928 --> 00:12:16.498
so one of the projects we picked was like drug abuse

323
00:12:16.498 --> 00:12:19.986
and over half the kids in the high schools were on drugs

324
00:12:19.986 --> 00:12:22.023
so we said well why don't we do something about that?

325
00:12:22.023 --> 00:12:24.092
A year and a half later we had wiped

326
00:12:24.092 --> 00:12:27.201
out the drug problem in six counties.

327
00:12:27.602 --> 00:12:30.049
You couldn't even push illegal drugs anymore.

328
00:12:30.129 --> 00:12:31.409
If you tried, the kids would look

329
00:12:31.409 --> 00:12:33.835
at you and say, that does have a color?

330
00:12:33.937 --> 00:12:35.612
And you think, well what's that?

331
00:12:35.612 --> 00:12:37.510
Well that's the fifth dimension.

332
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:39.089
They would just go into the fifth dimension,

333
00:12:39.089 --> 00:12:41.233
and the crime sindecents and

334
00:12:41.233 --> 00:12:43.387
the people who push drugs have absolutely

335
00:12:43.387 --> 00:12:45.685
no defense against that,

336
00:12:46.171 --> 00:12:47.334
because they have no understanding of how

337
00:12:47.334 --> 00:12:48.731
what's really going on.

338
00:12:48.731 --> 00:12:49.840
They're just trying to make money

339
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.003
or doing whatever they're doing,

340
00:12:51.003 --> 00:12:52.261
and they have no idea

341
00:12:52.261 --> 00:12:53.531
what's really driving them

342
00:12:53.531 --> 00:12:55.242
nor how to transform it.

343
00:12:55.344 --> 00:12:57.498
The kids who used to be on drugs

344
00:12:57.498 --> 00:13:01.477
cleaned up the problem in six cities.

345
00:13:01.477 --> 00:13:04.399
We took that and said, well now what do we do?

346
00:13:04.399 --> 00:13:06.159
Because we kind of worked our way out of a job,

347
00:13:06.159 --> 00:13:07.930
so we took another project,

348
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.217
and that was the state mental hospital.

349
00:13:10.255 --> 00:13:12.900
What we did is we took the families

350
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.108
who had Virginia, Sertier,

351
00:13:15.108 --> 00:13:17.145
and Carl Whitegar, and some of these great

352
00:13:17.145 --> 00:13:20.414
therapists called the Identified Patient,

353
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.862
so they're in the mental hospital yes,

354
00:13:22.862 --> 00:13:24.835
so we taught the families

355
00:13:24.835 --> 00:13:26.393
how to do this,

356
00:13:26.393 --> 00:13:27.598
how to transform

357
00:13:27.598 --> 00:13:31.128
the information systems inside themselves holographically.

358
00:13:31.128 --> 00:13:32.909
We're using a holographic dimension.

359
00:13:32.909 --> 00:13:36.696
Well before you know it, like 80% or more,

360
00:13:36.696 --> 00:13:39.021
it was more than 80% of the mental hospitals out on

361
00:13:39.021 --> 00:13:40.760
the streets with their families.

362
00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.709
They're all healthy.

363
00:13:41.709 --> 00:13:42.520
They're all

364
00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.941
they've all no longer have any of the symptoms.

365
00:13:44.941 --> 00:13:46.189
<v Woman>You're out of work again.</v>

366
00:13:46.189 --> 00:13:48.444
<v ->Well actually,</v>

367
00:13:48.444 --> 00:13:48.930
<v Woman>Just teasing.</v>

368
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:50.252
<v ->They kicked us out of work,</v>

369
00:13:50.252 --> 00:13:51.394
because the governor called and says

370
00:13:51.394 --> 00:13:53.825
bern, stop what you're doing.

371
00:13:53.825 --> 00:13:54.775
No, why?

372
00:13:54.775 --> 00:13:56.247
<v Woman>We have empty beds in this place.</v>

373
00:13:56.247 --> 00:13:56.865
<v ->That's right.</v>

374
00:13:56.865 --> 00:13:58.081
We're paid by the bed.

375
00:13:58.081 --> 00:13:58.913
You're killing the hospital.

376
00:13:58.913 --> 00:13:59.734
Well let it die.

377
00:13:59.734 --> 00:14:00.748
No, you can't do that because

378
00:14:00.748 --> 00:14:01.612
we have no alternative.

379
00:14:01.612 --> 00:14:02.636
Well alright I'll slow down.

380
00:14:02.636 --> 00:14:03.724
No, you have to stop,

381
00:14:03.724 --> 00:14:05.691
because, anyway

382
00:14:05.814 --> 00:14:06.552
that's a whole story.

383
00:14:06.552 --> 00:14:08.541
<v Woman>News like this doesn't stay quiet.</v>

384
00:14:08.541 --> 00:14:11.688
<v ->No, but the psychiatrist totally polarized</v>

385
00:14:11.688 --> 00:14:12.808
against what we were doing.

386
00:14:12.808 --> 00:14:13.821
<v Woman>Isn't that amazing.</v>

387
00:14:13.821 --> 00:14:15.496
<v ->It's amazing, so I've</v>

388
00:14:15.496 --> 00:14:16.445
written a special book called

389
00:14:16.445 --> 00:14:18.721
the Therapy Manifesto,

390
00:14:18.813 --> 00:14:21.277
and its like here's 95 things

391
00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:23.303
that you have to know if you claim to

392
00:14:23.303 --> 00:14:27.762
be a psychiatrist or anybody in the mental health industry.

393
00:14:27.762 --> 00:14:30.422
<v Woman>Who has this been embraced by?</v>

394
00:14:30.567 --> 00:14:31.615
<v ->Well I haven't published it yet.</v>

395
00:14:31.615 --> 00:14:32.553
<v Woman>Oh, I thought you</v>

396
00:14:32.553 --> 00:14:34.424
said you were
<v ->I was doing the editing.</v>

397
00:14:34.424 --> 00:14:35.070
<v Woman>I thought you said it was already out.</v>

398
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:36.974
<v ->It's written, but I haven't published it yet.</v>

399
00:14:36.974 --> 00:14:37.998
<v Woman>Yeah, I was gonna say</v>

400
00:14:37.998 --> 00:14:38.746
I didn't see that
<v ->I'm right in the middle</v>

401
00:14:38.746 --> 00:14:40.149
of a major publishing process.

402
00:14:40.149 --> 00:14:41.504
<v Woman>Oh, okay.</v>

403
00:14:41.504 --> 00:14:42.731
<v ->Anyway, so I got 10 books coming out,</v>

404
00:14:42.731 --> 00:14:43.413
and that's one of them,

405
00:14:43.413 --> 00:14:44.597
and I wrote it because of this,

406
00:14:44.597 --> 00:14:46.101
because they need to know.

407
00:14:46.101 --> 00:14:48.032
<v Woman>Yes, so it would appear,</v>

408
00:14:48.032 --> 00:14:50.474
and then at what point did this sort of

409
00:14:50.474 --> 00:14:52.783
move you onto the

410
00:14:53.322 --> 00:14:55.946
justice system and working in mental institutions.

411
00:14:55.946 --> 00:14:57.474
<v ->The next project was we had these people come in</v>

412
00:14:57.474 --> 00:14:59.533
who were totally tragically,

413
00:14:59.533 --> 00:15:02.807
just cataclismically shut down because

414
00:15:02.807 --> 00:15:04.780
of things that had happened in their family,

415
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.103
like one of them had her daughter

416
00:15:06.103 --> 00:15:07.756
brutally murdered by her wonderful

417
00:15:07.756 --> 00:15:12.353
son in law, and nobody could figure out how come,

418
00:15:12.353 --> 00:15:14.438
and he's now in maximum security,

419
00:15:14.486 --> 00:15:16.321
so we showed her and the daughter

420
00:15:16.321 --> 00:15:19.019
whose married to the son now in prison,

421
00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:22.149
or son in law,

422
00:15:22.614 --> 00:15:25.334
and we showed the daughter and the mother

423
00:15:25.334 --> 00:15:26.906
how to do this.

424
00:15:26.933 --> 00:15:28.762
They went to the prison.

425
00:15:28.811 --> 00:15:30.837
They had this tremendous experience,

426
00:15:30.837 --> 00:15:32.298
took awhile, because there was so much

427
00:15:32.298 --> 00:15:35.690
suspicion, but they learned how to do it,

428
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:37.898
and they transformed that young man,

429
00:15:37.898 --> 00:15:40.010
found out exactly what happened in him,

430
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.421
transformed all the information systems.

431
00:15:42.421 --> 00:15:45.087
They have a love now, and he teaches

432
00:15:45.087 --> 00:15:48.575
others in maximum security prison how to do that.

433
00:15:48.575 --> 00:15:51.241
I could tell you dozens of stories like that,

434
00:15:51.241 --> 00:15:54.516
amazing, remarkable recovery,

435
00:15:54.516 --> 00:15:57.982
and that's in the toughest, hardest

436
00:15:57.982 --> 00:16:00.926
harshest environment we have.

437
00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:02.483
So it became kind of like,

438
00:16:02.483 --> 00:16:06.146
well is there anything that can't be solved?

439
00:16:06.334 --> 00:16:08.990
<v Woman>And we'll get to this a little bit later,</v>

440
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:10.824
because I wanna continue hop scotching

441
00:16:10.824 --> 00:16:13.939
through some of the other work that you've done

442
00:16:13.939 --> 00:16:16.797
and to these you've worked with,

443
00:16:16.797 --> 00:16:18.418
but here we're talking about a subject

444
00:16:18.418 --> 00:16:21.810
as complex as quantum physics and multi dimensions

445
00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:22.919
and hyper space,

446
00:16:22.919 --> 00:16:24.669
and holographic universe.

447
00:16:24.669 --> 00:16:25.778
<v ->Oh we haven't talked about hyper space yet.</v>

448
00:16:25.778 --> 00:16:26.780
<v Woman>How can you</v>

449
00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.156
<v ->That's another dimension.</v>

450
00:16:28.156 --> 00:16:29.106
<v Woman>But I'm going to ask you,</v>

451
00:16:29.106 --> 00:16:31.196
before this is over is what you just said,

452
00:16:31.196 --> 00:16:36.196
how can you make this so incredibly accessible to people?

453
00:16:36.305 --> 00:16:37.884
This must be where the magic

454
00:16:37.884 --> 00:16:39.484
of your work comes in.

455
00:16:39.484 --> 00:16:41.920
<v ->Because it's already in every person.</v>

456
00:16:44.177 --> 00:16:45.595
It's nothing magical about it.

457
00:16:45.595 --> 00:16:48.138
It seems magical, but it's only because

458
00:16:49.278 --> 00:16:51.867
every person is already magical.

459
00:16:51.867 --> 00:16:53.861
They have a dimension inside of them,

460
00:16:53.861 --> 00:16:57.648
once they access what we call the hyper spatial

461
00:16:57.648 --> 00:16:59.344
dimension, that's what people like Roger Penrose

462
00:16:59.344 --> 00:17:01.509
and Stuart Hamrock

463
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:03.759
and the science of consciousness people

464
00:17:03.759 --> 00:17:05.679
are calling that dimension,

465
00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:07.685
but it's a measurable dimension.

466
00:17:07.685 --> 00:17:09.914
You can see it's effects and a 90

467
00:17:09.914 --> 00:17:13.433
something percent of reality is in that dimension,

468
00:17:13.433 --> 00:17:15.876
and you can see it in everything from gravity to everything,

469
00:17:15.876 --> 00:17:17.412
and then you can sense that there's

470
00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:19.982
networks of information being

471
00:17:19.982 --> 00:17:22.862
processed even before you think,

472
00:17:22.862 --> 00:17:24.675
so it's called thought before thought.

473
00:17:24.675 --> 00:17:28.061
What is that about?

474
00:17:28.163 --> 00:17:30.243
<v Woman>And you're somehow changing</v>

475
00:17:30.243 --> 00:17:32.200
<v ->Oh it's so simple.</v>

476
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:32.658
<v Woman>Is it</v>

477
00:17:32.658 --> 00:17:33.405
really so simple?
<v ->Can I tell you how to</v>

478
00:17:33.405 --> 00:17:33.938
do it yet?

479
00:17:33.938 --> 00:17:34.584
<v Voiceover>Yeah, yeah, just come on,</v>

480
00:17:34.584 --> 00:17:35.658
let's get to that part, and then

481
00:17:35.658 --> 00:17:37.209
<v ->How bout just this,</v>

482
00:17:37.209 --> 00:17:38.809
can you imagine

483
00:17:38.809 --> 00:17:41.060
just being peaceful, like in a place of peace.

484
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.681
Can you imagine a place of peace?

485
00:17:42.681 --> 00:17:43.470
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

486
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:45.049
<v ->Okay, what's it like?</v>

487
00:17:45.049 --> 00:17:45.998
<v Woman>Peaceful.</v>

488
00:17:45.998 --> 00:17:48.227
<v ->That's right, so mines a beach on Maui,</v>

489
00:17:48.227 --> 00:17:49.550
that's how I started this,

490
00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:50.457
just go to a beach on Maui,

491
00:17:50.457 --> 00:17:51.662
and then all of a sudden all the chaos

492
00:17:51.662 --> 00:17:53.816
around me just goes away because I'm on the beach,

493
00:17:53.816 --> 00:17:54.958
and I'm peaceful.

494
00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:55.960
<v Woman>That's mine.</v>

495
00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.941
I'm normally in the sand, hearing the water

496
00:17:57.941 --> 00:17:58.448
<v ->Right.</v>

497
00:17:58.448 --> 00:17:59.707
<v Woman>lying down, sun beating</v>

498
00:17:59.707 --> 00:18:01.370
<v ->And you can feel the sun, you smell the breeze,</v>

499
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:03.252
and it's just wonderful isn't it?

500
00:18:03.252 --> 00:18:05.583
Now imagine coming towards you on your

501
00:18:05.583 --> 00:18:08.090
in your place of peace, on a beach or where ever,

502
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.876
yourself at your fullest potential,

503
00:18:11.876 --> 00:18:13.732
because you know scientifically that

504
00:18:13.732 --> 00:18:16.121
everything is driven by potential,

505
00:18:16.121 --> 00:18:18.884
so every set of circumstances is that way,

506
00:18:18.884 --> 00:18:20.975
and you're a set of circumstances so

507
00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:23.315
what's the potential that drives you?

508
00:18:25.198 --> 00:18:26.867
What does she look like?

509
00:18:27.086 --> 00:18:28.381
Can you tell?

510
00:18:28.921 --> 00:18:31.331
Can you sense what she feels like?

511
00:18:31.331 --> 00:18:32.238
<v Woman>Mhmm.</v>

512
00:18:32.238 --> 00:18:33.190
<v ->Does she care about you?</v>

513
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.990
<v Woman>Mhmm.</v>

514
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.774
<v ->Yes, will she talk with you?</v>

515
00:18:36.774 --> 00:18:37.653
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

516
00:18:37.653 --> 00:18:39.381
<v ->Well guess what you just did?</v>

517
00:18:39.381 --> 00:18:40.176
Now was that hard?

518
00:18:40.176 --> 00:18:40.901
<v Woman>No.</v>

519
00:18:40.901 --> 00:18:43.312
<v ->She is now your source.</v>

520
00:18:43.312 --> 00:18:44.474
Anytime you wanna know anything

521
00:18:44.474 --> 00:18:45.893
from the hyper spatial dimension

522
00:18:45.893 --> 00:18:47.354
guess who will help you do it?

523
00:18:47.354 --> 00:18:48.858
Because she cares about you,

524
00:18:48.858 --> 00:18:50.885
she knows everything there,

525
00:18:50.885 --> 00:18:52.421
because everything is connected,

526
00:18:52.421 --> 00:18:53.967
and guess who it's connected through?

527
00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:55.855
Guess who you're connected through?

528
00:18:55.855 --> 00:19:00.855
From a scientific basis your full potential self

529
00:19:00.964 --> 00:19:02.511
is the real you,

530
00:19:02.511 --> 00:19:04.953
and in Stephen Hawking's latest book

531
00:19:04.953 --> 00:19:08.857
the Universe in a Nut Shell 2001 he published it,

532
00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:12.110
near the end of the book, the final conclusion

533
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:15.032
of his view of what's happening in the universe

534
00:19:15.032 --> 00:19:18.190
he shows your full potential self

535
00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:23.190
projecting itself onto this space time continuum.

536
00:19:25.293 --> 00:19:26.797
<v Woman>Beautiful, simple,</v>

537
00:19:26.797 --> 00:19:28.741
elegant as they say in the world of physics.

538
00:19:28.741 --> 00:19:30.181
<v ->Shows how the physics</v>

539
00:19:30.181 --> 00:19:33.748
confirms everything about that.

540
00:19:33.893 --> 00:19:36.932
40 years ago I started introducing

541
00:19:36.932 --> 00:19:40.132
people who had emotional problems

542
00:19:40.132 --> 00:19:42.803
to their full potential selves.

543
00:19:42.809 --> 00:19:44.057
<v Woman>Just beautiful.</v>

544
00:19:44.057 --> 00:19:46.041
Well this caught on.

545
00:19:46.041 --> 00:19:47.801
It went past the prison systems

546
00:19:47.801 --> 00:19:50.425
and past the mental hospitals and pretty soon

547
00:19:50.425 --> 00:19:54.169
you're attracting super high in clients, right?

548
00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:56.760
Bank of America, Toyota

549
00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.174
<v ->All those people, and you know,</v>

550
00:20:00.174 --> 00:20:01.123
it was good.

551
00:20:01.123 --> 00:20:02.936
Bowing was in total chaos

552
00:20:02.936 --> 00:20:05.165
when Frank was in charge and doing all this stuff,

553
00:20:05.165 --> 00:20:07.037
so we trained all the trainers,

554
00:20:07.064 --> 00:20:08.034
and then they went to work

555
00:20:08.034 --> 00:20:09.037
and trained all their people

556
00:20:09.037 --> 00:20:11.992
and just within a few weeks, Bowing came back

557
00:20:11.992 --> 00:20:13.468
into productivity.

558
00:20:13.538 --> 00:20:15.287
It's like the coherence occurred.

559
00:20:15.287 --> 00:20:18.444
It's like somebody blew a kind of tuning

560
00:20:18.444 --> 00:20:22.316
fork for the choir, and suddenly everybody got it,

561
00:20:22.316 --> 00:20:24.081
and they just went back to work.

562
00:20:24.343 --> 00:20:25.783
It's like a company so big that it

563
00:20:25.783 --> 00:20:26.948
was unmanageable.

564
00:20:26.948 --> 00:20:27.951
<v Woman>Right.</v>

565
00:20:27.951 --> 00:20:29.369
<v ->And all of a sudden it became manageable.</v>

566
00:20:29.369 --> 00:20:30.798
Now how does that work?

567
00:20:30.798 --> 00:20:31.449
It seems like magic,

568
00:20:31.449 --> 00:20:35.001
but it is not because companies have an information system

569
00:20:35.001 --> 00:20:38.973
we call the being of system synergy, its called the boss.

570
00:20:39.022 --> 00:20:41.390
B-O-S-S, being of system synergy,

571
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:44.270
and just is a name for something that occurs

572
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:47.495
naturally in every system.

573
00:20:48.035 --> 00:20:51.207
<v Woman>And you</v>

574
00:20:51.234 --> 00:20:53.026
<v ->So you can talk to the bosses is what I'm saying,</v>

575
00:20:53.026 --> 00:20:54.349
and you can communicate and so

576
00:20:54.349 --> 00:20:55.277
can everybody else,

577
00:20:55.277 --> 00:20:57.624
and pretty soon, it's like the

578
00:20:58.605 --> 00:21:00.183
San Diego Newspaper had an advertisement

579
00:21:00.183 --> 00:21:02.150
for an executive.

580
00:21:02.263 --> 00:21:04.588
They said we want an executive that's capable

581
00:21:04.588 --> 00:21:08.187
of connecting with the entity that's running this company,

582
00:21:08.396 --> 00:21:10.135
and then disseminating that information

583
00:21:10.135 --> 00:21:11.995
to everybody in the company,

584
00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.342
and we'll pay a quarter of a million dollars a year,

585
00:21:14.342 --> 00:21:16.187
if you can do that.

586
00:21:16.187 --> 00:21:17.510
That was their advertisement.

587
00:21:18.444 --> 00:21:19.446
I thought that was pretty

588
00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:20.449
in tune
<v Woman>You answered the ad.</v>

589
00:21:20.449 --> 00:21:20.923
<v ->No, no</v>

590
00:21:20.923 --> 00:21:22.000
(laughter)

591
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.575
I was not looking for that kind of job,

592
00:21:24.603 --> 00:21:25.904
but I could teach them how to do it.

593
00:21:25.904 --> 00:21:27.131
<v Woman>Yes, yes</v>

594
00:21:27.131 --> 00:21:28.784
<v ->So then we got into all this stuff</v>

595
00:21:28.784 --> 00:21:31.386
about what's the biggest problem we've

596
00:21:31.386 --> 00:21:33.055
got in the world?

597
00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:35.258
<v Woman>Lack of peace.</v>

598
00:21:35.258 --> 00:21:37.138
<v ->It was the middle of the 80s at</v>

599
00:21:37.138 --> 00:21:38.183
this time
<v Woman>Thats right.</v>

600
00:21:38.183 --> 00:21:39.506
<v ->And that was the Cold War,</v>

601
00:21:39.506 --> 00:21:42.279
so I said to my full potential self,

602
00:21:42.279 --> 00:21:43.879
why don't we just,

603
00:21:43.879 --> 00:21:46.620
we're spending 350 billion dollars a year

604
00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.630
on this war.

605
00:21:48.796 --> 00:21:51.467
Could we do anything about that?

606
00:21:51.814 --> 00:21:54.411
And my full potential chuckled and said okay.

607
00:21:54.417 --> 00:21:55.142
Is that what you want?

608
00:21:55.142 --> 00:21:56.902
Yes, do something about that one,

609
00:21:56.902 --> 00:22:01.902
and two days later I got a call from Barbara Marx Hubbard.

610
00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:03.750
Barbara Marx Hubbard is a friend of mine.

611
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:06.565
We've done a lot of speaking in the same places and things,

612
00:22:06.565 --> 00:22:11.205
and Barbara said I'm part of the Soviet American Dialogues

613
00:22:11.205 --> 00:22:15.504
for peace and Rama Vernon has arranged for

614
00:22:15.504 --> 00:22:20.504
a major commitment from the military of the Soviet Union.

615
00:22:21.327 --> 00:22:22.884
<v Woman>And we're talking brass that's</v>

616
00:22:22.884 --> 00:22:23.876
pretty high up there.

617
00:22:23.876 --> 00:22:24.836
<v ->These were the leaders</v>

618
00:22:24.836 --> 00:22:28.051
This is the leaders of the Soviet military

619
00:22:28.153 --> 00:22:29.828
to change from a peace room,

620
00:22:29.828 --> 00:22:33.213
I mean from a war room to a peace room mentality.

621
00:22:33.213 --> 00:22:34.820
<v Woman>Now that's a challenge.</v>

622
00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:38.301
<v ->She said, we don't have a clue what to do Vernon.</v>

623
00:22:38.649 --> 00:22:41.224
And I said well I think I can handle it.

624
00:22:41.347 --> 00:22:43.080
I think I know exactly what to do,

625
00:22:43.086 --> 00:22:44.264
because I did.

626
00:22:45.219 --> 00:22:47.150
<v Woman>So this launched you on an entirely</v>

627
00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:49.539
new path as you headed to Russia,

628
00:22:49.539 --> 00:22:51.352
and you had this incredible meeting

629
00:22:51.352 --> 00:22:53.538
with the top brass, the elite

630
00:22:53.538 --> 00:22:56.994
of the Russian military during the days of the Cold War,

631
00:22:56.994 --> 00:22:58.765
and sitting at a table across from them

632
00:22:58.765 --> 00:23:01.703
in essence at attention.

633
00:23:01.826 --> 00:23:03.010
<v ->Well they were at attention.</v>

634
00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:03.778
<v Woman>They were.</v>

635
00:23:03.778 --> 00:23:04.684
What happened?

636
00:23:04.684 --> 00:23:06.124
It's an incredible story.

637
00:23:06.124 --> 00:23:07.394
Please tell us what happened from

638
00:23:07.394 --> 00:23:08.414
that point on.

639
00:23:08.414 --> 00:23:11.078
It really changed the course of events.

640
00:23:11.078 --> 00:23:12.401
<v ->I have to go back a little bit to explain</v>

641
00:23:12.401 --> 00:23:15.046
how come I knew, because as soon

642
00:23:15.046 --> 00:23:17.328
as I made this commitment to do something about it

643
00:23:17.328 --> 00:23:19.803
people started showing up at my seminars

644
00:23:19.803 --> 00:23:21.194
that were Russian.

645
00:23:21.221 --> 00:23:22.363
<v Woman>Oh, interesting, okay.</v>

646
00:23:22.363 --> 00:23:24.453
<v ->And then the first man who I could identify</v>

647
00:23:24.453 --> 00:23:26.821
as Russian jumped up in the middle

648
00:23:26.821 --> 00:23:28.933
of what I was saying

649
00:23:28.933 --> 00:23:30.352
and came up to the front of the room,

650
00:23:30.352 --> 00:23:33.455
threw me against the wall, put his arm against

651
00:23:33.455 --> 00:23:36.154
my throat and then was gonna punch me out,

652
00:23:36.154 --> 00:23:39.540
and he's screaming at the top of his lungs in Russian,

653
00:23:39.631 --> 00:23:41.284
and I didn't understand Russian,

654
00:23:41.284 --> 00:23:46.233
so I just used my processes, just went to my place of peace,

655
00:23:46.233 --> 00:23:47.641
called up my full potential self,

656
00:23:47.641 --> 00:23:50.611
and then just said okay.

657
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.822
And just stopped him right there.

658
00:23:51.822 --> 00:23:54.798
I looked at him with love and just total presence

659
00:23:54.798 --> 00:23:56.025
and said, okay.

660
00:23:56.025 --> 00:23:57.539
What is it?

661
00:23:57.539 --> 00:23:58.840
Then he realized what he was doing,

662
00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.808
so then he switched into Russian

663
00:24:01.112 --> 00:24:02.296
and we had a quite a conversation,

664
00:24:02.296 --> 00:24:04.312
and he still held me for awhile,

665
00:24:04.312 --> 00:24:05.827
and then I realized.

666
00:24:05.827 --> 00:24:09.191
This man thinks entirely different than I think.

667
00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:11.960
And I'm going, how do Russians think?

668
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.874
It was a challenge.

669
00:24:14.135 --> 00:24:16.279
All these Russians starting coming,

670
00:24:16.279 --> 00:24:18.295
and six months later I got it.

671
00:24:18.295 --> 00:24:20.337
I knew then how they thought.

672
00:24:20.738 --> 00:24:23.639
All of that had started before Barbara,

673
00:24:23.639 --> 00:24:25.729
and no sooner did I get it, that's when Barbara called me,

674
00:24:25.729 --> 00:24:29.740
and so then I knew that I probably could help,

675
00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.641
because I knew what needed to be done

676
00:24:32.641 --> 00:24:35.376
with a Russian kind of thinking.

677
00:24:35.638 --> 00:24:38.795
When the general, they were all in attention

678
00:24:38.795 --> 00:24:42.443
sitting like stern, no eyes to either side

679
00:24:42.443 --> 00:24:44.811
or anything, just straight ahead.

680
00:24:44.811 --> 00:24:45.718
We came in.

681
00:24:45.718 --> 00:24:48.715
No hellos, anything, just rigid, stern,

682
00:24:48.715 --> 00:24:51.221
and just totally attention while you're sitting,

683
00:24:51.221 --> 00:24:54.400
and all their hats were level.

684
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.306
They were in full uniform,

685
00:24:55.306 --> 00:24:56.234
so much brass.

686
00:24:56.234 --> 00:24:58.553
It was amazing,

687
00:24:58.815 --> 00:25:01.898
a real presentation of power.

688
00:25:01.898 --> 00:25:03.220
Then the man across from me,

689
00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.194
exactly on time got up,

690
00:25:05.194 --> 00:25:06.751
and there was just four of us,

691
00:25:06.751 --> 00:25:07.839
Barbara and I and then

692
00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:08.799
a couple of ministers who

693
00:25:08.799 --> 00:25:11.321
woo!

694
00:25:11.423 --> 00:25:14.089
And so this guy gets up and he looks at us

695
00:25:14.089 --> 00:25:15.966
just like with total disgust,

696
00:25:15.966 --> 00:25:17.780
and then he takes both of his fists

697
00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.294
and he slams them on the table

698
00:25:19.294 --> 00:25:20.169
and then he screams,

699
00:25:20.169 --> 00:25:22.307
war is inevitable!

700
00:25:22.867 --> 00:25:24.424
He does it in Russian so the translators

701
00:25:24.424 --> 00:25:26.558
translating, and I'm looking over,

702
00:25:26.558 --> 00:25:28.573
and these people next to me, including Barbara

703
00:25:28.573 --> 00:25:29.886
were going

704
00:25:30.696 --> 00:25:32.863
<v Woman>Not the way they expected the meeting to begin.</v>

705
00:25:32.863 --> 00:25:34.581
<v ->They're just like at this point,</v>

706
00:25:34.581 --> 00:25:37.045
they're no good because they're already into

707
00:25:37.045 --> 00:25:40.255
what I call an event risen.

708
00:25:40.255 --> 00:25:42.548
They're in defense and surprise,

709
00:25:42.548 --> 00:25:44.681
so I just did my little process

710
00:25:44.681 --> 00:25:46.356
that I used with my Russian friends,

711
00:25:46.356 --> 00:25:48.856
switched into being Russian,

712
00:25:49.278 --> 00:25:51.508
because you have to know your enemy, as

713
00:25:51.508 --> 00:25:54.547
some famous people have said, and become

714
00:25:54.547 --> 00:25:57.635
your enemy before you can deal with your enemy,

715
00:25:57.758 --> 00:25:59.144
and these weren't my enemies,

716
00:25:59.144 --> 00:26:01.448
but these were people who thought they were.

717
00:26:01.448 --> 00:26:04.211
I stood up and I just looked

718
00:26:04.211 --> 00:26:07.458
at them with just total disdain,

719
00:26:07.581 --> 00:26:08.349
every one of them.

720
00:26:08.349 --> 00:26:09.437
There were about 17 of them.

721
00:26:09.437 --> 00:26:11.453
I just took my time and looked at every one of them,

722
00:26:11.453 --> 00:26:13.010
and then I took both my fists,

723
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:15.175
and I pounded harder than he did,

724
00:26:15.175 --> 00:26:17.426
and I repeated it more often,

725
00:26:17.426 --> 00:26:19.303
and I screamed louder than him

726
00:26:19.303 --> 00:26:22.620
war is not inevitable!

727
00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.647
What is inevitable sir,

728
00:26:24.647 --> 00:26:26.151
and I pointed right into his face

729
00:26:26.151 --> 00:26:30.236
is that life potential will unfold itself,

730
00:26:30.236 --> 00:26:34.044
and your moral and ethical responsibilities sir

731
00:26:34.044 --> 00:26:36.859
is to help yourself, your comrades,

732
00:26:36.859 --> 00:26:38.651
your families, your country,

733
00:26:38.651 --> 00:26:42.939
and your entire nation to become part

734
00:26:42.939 --> 00:26:45.126
of the family of nations to help

735
00:26:45.126 --> 00:26:48.554
that life potential unfold, sir!

736
00:26:49.093 --> 00:26:51.024
And I sat down.

737
00:26:51.024 --> 00:26:52.852
None of that was prepared,

738
00:26:53.712 --> 00:26:55.184
but it was the thing.

739
00:26:55.184 --> 00:26:56.037
<v Woman>I would have loved to have been there.</v>

740
00:26:56.037 --> 00:26:57.946
<v ->That needed to be said.</v>

741
00:26:57.946 --> 00:26:59.663
You know how when you sit down and you kind of sit,

742
00:26:59.663 --> 00:27:02.245
when I looked up his head,

743
00:27:02.245 --> 00:27:03.727
all the hats had tilted.

744
00:27:03.727 --> 00:27:05.775
That's the first thing my peripheral vision showed me,

745
00:27:05.775 --> 00:27:07.634
and his head was down on the table about

746
00:27:07.634 --> 00:27:09.671
this far away from it, looking up

747
00:27:09.671 --> 00:27:12.993
at me inside my eyes to see who was in there,

748
00:27:13.457 --> 00:27:16.171
because nobody had ever addressed them

749
00:27:16.316 --> 00:27:18.422
in the way I had,

750
00:27:18.918 --> 00:27:21.696
and I looked at him and I smiled, and I winked.

751
00:27:21.937 --> 00:27:23.163
<v Woman>Santa Claus</v>

752
00:27:23.163 --> 00:27:26.139
<v ->And he burst out laughing,</v>

753
00:27:26.139 --> 00:27:27.952
and then everybody else of course laughed,

754
00:27:27.952 --> 00:27:29.712
because he was the main guy,

755
00:27:29.712 --> 00:27:31.077
and so then they all laughed,

756
00:27:31.077 --> 00:27:32.987
and he says, ah yes, and he says this in english now.

757
00:27:32.987 --> 00:27:37.556
Ah yes, but how does one unfold that potential.

758
00:27:37.605 --> 00:27:41.460
I said, now we can begin to discuss this,

759
00:27:41.807 --> 00:27:43.461
and we went through a discussion that was

760
00:27:43.461 --> 00:27:48.218
fantastic about how the war mentality

761
00:27:48.218 --> 00:27:50.068
has no solutions,

762
00:27:50.372 --> 00:27:53.231
and how if you get into a peace mind,

763
00:27:53.231 --> 00:27:57.107
it's the mind of solutions for unfolding potential,

764
00:27:57.177 --> 00:27:59.940
and these are the processes.

765
00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.545
He was so impressed, and so was I with all of them

766
00:28:03.545 --> 00:28:06.169
that what we did is he became my friend,

767
00:28:06.169 --> 00:28:09.699
and then he guided me through all kinds of things in Russia.

768
00:28:09.699 --> 00:28:12.797
He introduced me to the space agency.

769
00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.107
He introduced me to the Academies.

770
00:28:15.107 --> 00:28:16.195
<v Woman>Academy of Sciences</v>

771
00:28:16.195 --> 00:28:17.432
<v ->The Academy of Sciences.</v>

772
00:28:17.432 --> 00:28:19.608
They took their elite academy,

773
00:28:19.608 --> 00:28:20.930
which is their highest one

774
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:23.714
where all the heads of all their other academies meet.

775
00:28:23.714 --> 00:28:26.727
It's called the academy of natural science,

776
00:28:27.181 --> 00:28:31.170
and they made a special academy inside of that academy

777
00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:33.303
for the academy of holodynamics.

778
00:28:33.303 --> 00:28:34.396
<v Woman>Incredible.</v>

779
00:28:34.396 --> 00:28:35.607
<v ->And one day he looked at me and said,</v>

780
00:28:35.607 --> 00:28:37.911
I believe that all the other academies.

781
00:28:37.911 --> 00:28:39.052
I shouldn't maybe talk about this,

782
00:28:39.052 --> 00:28:41.046
all the other academies will be absorbed

783
00:28:41.046 --> 00:28:43.116
into the academy of holodynamics,

784
00:28:43.116 --> 00:28:46.171
because it is the academy of the whole dynamic,

785
00:28:46.177 --> 00:28:47.990
and it is what's needed in Russia

786
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:50.550
more than anything else is the integration

787
00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:51.888
of our knowledge.

788
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:53.635
<v Woman>And this work spread through out</v>

789
00:28:53.635 --> 00:28:54.424
the country.

790
00:28:54.424 --> 00:28:57.144
<v ->What happened then is he assigned me to</v>

791
00:28:57.144 --> 00:28:58.349
work with different ministries,

792
00:28:58.349 --> 00:29:00.791
and so I worked with about 14 ministries.

793
00:29:00.791 --> 00:29:03.362
Intensive meetings, day after day,

794
00:29:03.362 --> 00:29:04.717
and night after night,

795
00:29:04.717 --> 00:29:06.551
and into the middle of the night,

796
00:29:06.551 --> 00:29:08.172
and sometimes in the middle of the night

797
00:29:08.172 --> 00:29:08.940
they'd come and get me

798
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.028
and take me to

799
00:29:10.028 --> 00:29:12.609
have this meetings, and it went on and on and on

800
00:29:12.609 --> 00:29:13.911
like this for months,

801
00:29:13.911 --> 00:29:16.023
and in fact for about eight years or so,

802
00:29:16.023 --> 00:29:19.244
and the academicians were so taken by all the

803
00:29:19.244 --> 00:29:20.918
information we were bringing them

804
00:29:20.918 --> 00:29:23.222
that they said, well we wanna

805
00:29:23.222 --> 00:29:28.096
begin to sponsor certain conferences on this.

806
00:29:28.096 --> 00:29:30.646
We had international conferences on holodynamics

807
00:29:30.646 --> 00:29:32.410
for about six years,

808
00:29:33.227 --> 00:29:35.381
and every year we'd get together and

809
00:29:35.381 --> 00:29:38.848
one year the academicians brought all the children

810
00:29:38.848 --> 00:29:39.722
with all their art.

811
00:29:39.722 --> 00:29:42.261
They have this traveling art show of 400 children

812
00:29:42.261 --> 00:29:43.839
who travel all over the country

813
00:29:43.839 --> 00:29:45.418
and show their art,

814
00:29:45.418 --> 00:29:47.786
and you can't ever buy this art, because

815
00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:49.450
it's the treasure of Russia,

816
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:52.793
but they gave me my most favorite picture of all of it.

817
00:29:56.752 --> 00:29:58.521
<v Woman>How sweet.</v>

818
00:29:58.804 --> 00:29:59.550
How incredible.

819
00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:01.844
What an impact you had on an entire nation,

820
00:30:01.844 --> 00:30:05.097
and not only that, it wasn't just governmental

821
00:30:05.097 --> 00:30:05.833
levels.

822
00:30:05.833 --> 00:30:08.510
You helped through this training.

823
00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:09.790
<v ->I was gonna tell you how that works.</v>

824
00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:14.790
We got with the ministry of social problems.

825
00:30:15.965 --> 00:30:17.587
<v Woman>Yes, right, that's what I was going</v>

826
00:30:17.587 --> 00:30:18.696
to go into next,

827
00:30:18.696 --> 00:30:21.416
and they said, well this is unsolvable.

828
00:30:21.416 --> 00:30:22.653
We cannot solve our problems,

829
00:30:22.653 --> 00:30:23.666
and I said really?

830
00:30:23.666 --> 00:30:27.351
To me that's an invitation, an unsolvable problem.

831
00:30:27.613 --> 00:30:29.383
We looked at what had caused it,

832
00:30:29.383 --> 00:30:30.333
and we got back down.

833
00:30:30.333 --> 00:30:31.932
It took about two weeks to do this,

834
00:30:31.932 --> 00:30:33.116
but we got back down into the

835
00:30:33.116 --> 00:30:35.340
seven arenas of alienation,

836
00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.919
and the original party had said you must

837
00:30:38.919 --> 00:30:43.132
alienate the masses, alienate them from information,

838
00:30:43.132 --> 00:30:44.476
that's why so many telephones

839
00:30:44.476 --> 00:30:45.265
didn't work.

840
00:30:45.265 --> 00:30:47.697
No telephone books or anything like that,

841
00:30:47.697 --> 00:30:50.993
and then you must alienate them from decision-making,

842
00:30:50.993 --> 00:30:52.603
and you must alienate them from private

843
00:30:52.603 --> 00:30:55.082
property, and from private interest,

844
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:56.635
and it goes on and on like this.

845
00:30:56.635 --> 00:30:58.661
There were seven of these major arenas

846
00:30:58.661 --> 00:31:02.171
of alienation, and their implemented so that all of the

847
00:31:02.171 --> 00:31:05.482
decisions must be made from a central place.

848
00:31:05.488 --> 00:31:08.368
so you look at the social system of Russia,

849
00:31:08.368 --> 00:31:10.970
and you can see how a farmer could not

850
00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:14.127
go out to farm unless Moscow

851
00:31:14.127 --> 00:31:16.436
said it's the day to farm.

852
00:31:16.719 --> 00:31:18.074
Then you go out, and if it's raining

853
00:31:18.074 --> 00:31:20.367
in your area, you take your tractor out

854
00:31:20.367 --> 00:31:22.270
and you get stuck,

855
00:31:22.532 --> 00:31:23.545
and then you come back in

856
00:31:23.545 --> 00:31:26.084
and you have three and a half tractors,

857
00:31:26.084 --> 00:31:27.353
because if it gets stuck,

858
00:31:27.353 --> 00:31:29.497
by the time you get back and you get the other one out,

859
00:31:29.497 --> 00:31:30.937
and you get it out and it gets stuck,

860
00:31:30.937 --> 00:31:32.142
by the time you get the third one out

861
00:31:32.142 --> 00:31:34.088
maybe the rain has stopped.

862
00:31:34.297 --> 00:31:35.907
Anyway, they had this formula.

863
00:31:35.907 --> 00:31:37.091
I'm telling you what they told me.

864
00:31:37.091 --> 00:31:38.360
This is how their
<v Woman>It's amazing</v>

865
00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.037
<v ->Russian farmers explained it on the communes,</v>

866
00:31:41.037 --> 00:31:42.189
and they go on like this with

867
00:31:42.189 --> 00:31:46.029
food would have to be taken from 2,000 miles away,

868
00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:48.930
shipped into Moscow, and then shipped back

869
00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:50.765
and no refrigeration.

870
00:31:50.765 --> 00:31:54.215
Over half of their food was spoiling,

871
00:31:54.402 --> 00:31:56.631
and on and on the problems went.

872
00:31:56.631 --> 00:31:58.167
The biggest problem they said

873
00:31:58.167 --> 00:32:02.092
was the fact that 75% of their working

874
00:32:02.092 --> 00:32:04.102
force had stopped working.

875
00:32:04.951 --> 00:32:07.014
<v Woman>That's a problem.</v>

876
00:32:07.244 --> 00:32:08.662
<v ->They were all on the dole system,</v>

877
00:32:08.662 --> 00:32:12.268
so everybody got paid the same amount.

878
00:32:12.268 --> 00:32:14.241
Well when you're not working,

879
00:32:14.241 --> 00:32:16.229
the country is going broke.

880
00:32:16.769 --> 00:32:18.464
They said, can you fix that?

881
00:32:18.464 --> 00:32:20.709
I said, absolutely, here's how you do it,

882
00:32:20.736 --> 00:32:21.856
because I knew how to do it.

883
00:32:21.856 --> 00:32:23.829
All you have to do is teach people

884
00:32:23.829 --> 00:32:27.168
that the key to their unfolding is the unfolding

885
00:32:27.168 --> 00:32:28.789
of their own potential.

886
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:32.970
Information organizes from smallness to bigness,

887
00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:35.274
what they call from micro to macro.

888
00:32:35.274 --> 00:32:37.429
You look at that and you say okay,

889
00:32:37.429 --> 00:32:40.447
well if information organizes from micro to macro,

890
00:32:40.447 --> 00:32:43.071
why don't we teach individuals how

891
00:32:43.071 --> 00:32:45.390
to unfold their own potential,

892
00:32:45.492 --> 00:32:48.852
and then they will teach the ones around them.

893
00:32:48.852 --> 00:32:52.867
We began a seminar process throughout Russia.

894
00:32:54.036 --> 00:32:57.763
We did Unfolding Potential.

895
00:32:57.929 --> 00:32:59.817
<v Woman>And you had everything from people</v>

896
00:32:59.817 --> 00:33:02.110
not only getting back into the workforce,

897
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:06.109
but being able to self heal from cancer,

898
00:33:06.109 --> 00:33:08.797
and as I understand even cases of AIDS

899
00:33:08.797 --> 00:33:10.653
and other ailments, physical ailments,

900
00:33:10.653 --> 00:33:12.370
not just societal ailments.

901
00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:14.674
<v ->The amazing thing is that you cannot have a disease</v>

902
00:33:14.674 --> 00:33:16.488
unless there's an information field

903
00:33:16.488 --> 00:33:21.479
inside of you that creates the growing of the disease.

904
00:33:21.479 --> 00:33:23.452
When you get into the information field,

905
00:33:23.452 --> 00:33:26.748
it's made of specific information patterns.

906
00:33:26.748 --> 00:33:28.167
I call them holodines,

907
00:33:28.167 --> 00:33:33.167
and so holodines are causal patterns of their

908
00:33:33.297 --> 00:33:34.993
information systems

909
00:33:34.993 --> 00:33:37.334
that cause things to happen.

910
00:33:37.777 --> 00:33:40.006
You look it at, well where are the holodines,

911
00:33:40.006 --> 00:33:41.371
and then you get into all the biology

912
00:33:41.371 --> 00:33:42.907
and the physics and the mathematics

913
00:33:42.907 --> 00:33:44.486
and so forth, and we discovered well,

914
00:33:44.486 --> 00:33:47.152
holodines are inside your microtubules

915
00:33:47.152 --> 00:33:48.763
<v Woman>And that's where Stuart Hameroffs work</v>

916
00:33:48.763 --> 00:33:49.413
comes in.

917
00:33:49.413 --> 00:33:50.992
<v ->Right, and that's where Roger Penrose,</v>

918
00:33:50.992 --> 00:33:53.072
and that's where the science of consciousness.

919
00:33:53.072 --> 00:33:55.866
They've caught onto that in the last ten years or so,

920
00:33:55.866 --> 00:33:57.328
and we built our first

921
00:33:57.328 --> 00:34:01.391
synthetic, what do you call it, virtual

922
00:34:01.391 --> 00:34:05.850
microtule back in the academy of holodynamics

923
00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:09.417
back in 1996 I think it was.

924
00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:11.887
<v Woman>You were ahead of the game again</v>

925
00:34:11.887 --> 00:34:12.601
on that one.

926
00:34:12.601 --> 00:34:14.041
<v ->I don't know.</v>

927
00:34:14.041 --> 00:34:15.620
I found out about it.

928
00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:16.740
<v Woman>You got a</v>

929
00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:17.753
<v ->I found out about microtubles</v>

930
00:34:17.753 --> 00:34:18.713
<v Woman>You gotta admit that much.</v>

931
00:34:18.713 --> 00:34:21.123
Your full potential self is a leader.

932
00:34:21.123 --> 00:34:23.427
<v ->Well, I don't know.</v>

933
00:34:23.427 --> 00:34:25.539
What I am is a very curious being,

934
00:34:25.539 --> 00:34:28.643
and I love to see how you find solutions.

935
00:34:28.643 --> 00:34:31.128
It's like if there's some problem that can't be solved,

936
00:34:31.128 --> 00:34:33.549
then I'm just automatically drawn to it,

937
00:34:33.549 --> 00:34:35.619
because it's such an invitation.

938
00:34:35.619 --> 00:34:37.560
<v Woman>We have a big problem going right now.</v>

939
00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:38.701
The subject of terrorism,

940
00:34:38.701 --> 00:34:40.280
and it's my understanding that you're going

941
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.530
to be going to the Middle East soon,

942
00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:45.623
and can you talk about this a little bit?

943
00:34:45.623 --> 00:34:47.660
This dynamic and what you're going to do.

944
00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:48.727
<v ->I've been to the Middle East a couple times already,</v>

945
00:34:48.727 --> 00:34:50.892
because back in the 90s Roma Vernon

946
00:34:50.892 --> 00:34:52.375
saw what we did in Russia,

947
00:34:52.375 --> 00:34:54.817
because we had programs running in over 100 cities,

948
00:34:54.817 --> 00:34:56.343
and thousands and we

949
00:34:56.343 --> 00:35:00.438
certified over 600 teachers to teach,

950
00:35:00.438 --> 00:35:01.366
and they went out,

951
00:35:01.366 --> 00:35:03.521
and it's just like they developed these

952
00:35:03.521 --> 00:35:05.825
holodynamic centers and they would teach

953
00:35:05.825 --> 00:35:07.627
everybody, and the leaders and so forth,

954
00:35:07.627 --> 00:35:10.144
and it just made a shift and a couple of years later

955
00:35:10.144 --> 00:35:12.043
communism was illegal.

956
00:35:12.043 --> 00:35:15.200
It's like nobody could dominate them anymore.

957
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.597
They didn't need dictatorship.

958
00:35:16.597 --> 00:35:18.453
They found out they had a potential

959
00:35:18.453 --> 00:35:20.608
<v Woman>It is very exciting.</v>

960
00:35:20.608 --> 00:35:24.090
<v ->But terrorism is even simpler.</v>

961
00:35:25.418 --> 00:35:26.741
<v Woman>Care to share anymore.</v>

962
00:35:26.741 --> 00:35:28.501
<v ->Took us eight and a half years to work our way</v>

963
00:35:28.501 --> 00:35:31.865
through a reconstruction of the Soviet Empire,

964
00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:34.378
but terrorism is a little more evasive,

965
00:35:34.378 --> 00:35:35.715
but it's simpler.

966
00:35:38.769 --> 00:35:40.654
How can I tell you this?

967
00:35:40.654 --> 00:35:42.862
<v Woman>I know you can't give too much away about it, but</v>

968
00:35:42.862 --> 00:35:43.577
<v ->Yeah.</v>

969
00:35:43.577 --> 00:35:46.670
<v Woman>Will you be meeting people in key positions?</v>

970
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:48.248
<v ->Oh, yes, and I always do,</v>

971
00:35:48.248 --> 00:35:50.147
but see the therapist in Israel,

972
00:35:50.147 --> 00:35:54.917
the Israeli Jewish therapist have invited me there,

973
00:35:55.197 --> 00:35:57.821
because when you deal with any kind of dynamic

974
00:35:57.821 --> 00:35:59.261
it doesn't matter which end of the pole

975
00:35:59.261 --> 00:36:00.556
you deal with.

976
00:36:00.914 --> 00:36:02.412
It's all the same pole.

977
00:36:02.461 --> 00:36:03.976
The war between the Russians

978
00:36:03.976 --> 00:36:06.322
and the Americans was a pole,

979
00:36:06.322 --> 00:36:07.879
and the Americans on one side

980
00:36:07.879 --> 00:36:08.786
and the Russians on the other.

981
00:36:08.786 --> 00:36:11.911
It's the same in the war against the Israelis

982
00:36:11.911 --> 00:36:13.746
and the Palestinians.

983
00:36:13.746 --> 00:36:15.303
They're the same pole.

984
00:36:15.303 --> 00:36:17.585
They come from the same family tree.

985
00:36:17.585 --> 00:36:18.439
It like amazing thing.

986
00:36:18.439 --> 00:36:20.881
You'll watch this going how did this all happen?

987
00:36:20.881 --> 00:36:23.292
And you can trace it back in a panoramic view

988
00:36:23.292 --> 00:36:24.572
of the history, and so forth.

989
00:36:24.572 --> 00:36:25.286
You can see where

990
00:36:25.286 --> 00:36:26.246
the wars all start.
<v Woman>Cultural and family</v>

991
00:36:26.246 --> 00:36:27.057
dynamics.

992
00:36:27.057 --> 00:36:27.771
<v ->Cultural and family dynamics,</v>

993
00:36:27.771 --> 00:36:29.211
all the holodines involved,

994
00:36:29.211 --> 00:36:32.458
and then you realized the solution is so simple.

995
00:36:33.179 --> 00:36:35.803
We had this meeting in Israel, because Rama Vernon

996
00:36:35.803 --> 00:36:38.555
and Barbara Marsh Harwood were doing

997
00:36:38.555 --> 00:36:40.869
Israeli Palestinian dialogues for peace,

998
00:36:40.869 --> 00:36:42.363
just like they did the Russian ones,

999
00:36:42.363 --> 00:36:44.276
Russian American ones.

1000
00:36:44.752 --> 00:36:45.977
We got over there and

1001
00:36:48.287 --> 00:36:49.957
the first day there we traveled on

1002
00:36:49.957 --> 00:36:53.295
this little blue bus and visited all the places

1003
00:36:53.295 --> 00:36:54.650
that are known.

1004
00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:56.111
It was really boring for me frankly,

1005
00:36:56.111 --> 00:36:58.106
but because we had to do it so quickly

1006
00:36:58.106 --> 00:36:59.055
and so forth,

1007
00:36:59.055 --> 00:37:01.220
and there were all these graffitis on the walls

1008
00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.134
that have been black painted over,

1009
00:37:03.449 --> 00:37:05.465
and I said to the driver, what are those?

1010
00:37:05.465 --> 00:37:07.182
And the driver is Arabic, and said those

1011
00:37:07.182 --> 00:37:09.427
are the tears of Allah.

1012
00:37:10.222 --> 00:37:13.774
Those are the signs of the mourning that Allah is doing

1013
00:37:13.774 --> 00:37:15.069
for his people.

1014
00:37:15.843 --> 00:37:16.846
I didn't know what that meant,

1015
00:37:16.846 --> 00:37:19.235
but anyway we kept going, and they let us off

1016
00:37:19.235 --> 00:37:21.181
on one side of the old city.

1017
00:37:21.208 --> 00:37:22.787
I'm going through the old city,

1018
00:37:22.787 --> 00:37:25.922
and two cars and I got so interested

1019
00:37:25.922 --> 00:37:26.850
in all this stuff,

1020
00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:28.845
the group got kind of ahead of me,

1021
00:37:28.845 --> 00:37:31.490
and we're not supposed to leave by the way.

1022
00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:32.791
You're not supposed to ever talk to Arabs.

1023
00:37:32.791 --> 00:37:34.071
It's an 11 o'clock curfew and you're shot

1024
00:37:34.071 --> 00:37:36.738
after 11 o'clock without any questions.

1025
00:37:36.738 --> 00:37:38.647
It's like real war rules,

1026
00:37:38.647 --> 00:37:41.058
and I got separated, because these two

1027
00:37:41.058 --> 00:37:42.732
cars tried to pass and there wasn't enough room

1028
00:37:42.732 --> 00:37:44.934
for me so I stepped in the shop.

1029
00:37:45.079 --> 00:37:46.380
While the cars are passing I turned around and looked.

1030
00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:48.720
It's as big as Mervin's.

1031
00:37:49.366 --> 00:37:52.161
It's a huge store just with a little door,

1032
00:37:52.161 --> 00:37:54.469
and it's all old stuff.

1033
00:37:54.806 --> 00:37:57.355
Jars eight feet tall,

1034
00:37:57.355 --> 00:38:00.427
a big old well in there,

1035
00:38:00.427 --> 00:38:05.427
and clothing and jewels, just all kinds of ancient stuff.

1036
00:38:06.187 --> 00:38:08.085
Some of it 4,000 years old.

1037
00:38:08.085 --> 00:38:11.908
It's a real authentic shop.

1038
00:38:12.128 --> 00:38:14.421
I forgot all about the rest of the people.

1039
00:38:14.421 --> 00:38:16.789
<v Woman>You were going antique shopping now.</v>

1040
00:38:16.789 --> 00:38:18.069
<v ->This guy comes up to me and he says,</v>

1041
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:20.276
and he says how can I help you?

1042
00:38:20.276 --> 00:38:21.482
And I said well you speak good English,

1043
00:38:21.482 --> 00:38:23.220
and then his brother comes up and says,

1044
00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:26.563
yeah, we got a shop in LA.

1045
00:38:27.124 --> 00:38:29.492
They're Americans, but they're Arabs,

1046
00:38:29.492 --> 00:38:33.438
and I said well where'd you learn English,

1047
00:38:33.438 --> 00:38:35.011
and they said well,

1048
00:38:35.595 --> 00:38:36.897
the one looked at the other and said we learned

1049
00:38:36.897 --> 00:38:38.198
it in prison.

1050
00:38:38.198 --> 00:38:39.179
When were you in prison?

1051
00:38:39.179 --> 00:38:40.427
He says since I was five,

1052
00:38:40.427 --> 00:38:41.963
and the other guy says since I was six.

1053
00:38:41.963 --> 00:38:43.819
I said you learned it in prison?

1054
00:38:43.819 --> 00:38:45.237
How do you feel about,

1055
00:38:45.237 --> 00:38:46.485
I broke the second rule you never

1056
00:38:46.485 --> 00:38:48.000
talk to with Arabs,

1057
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.061
I said well how do you feel about the Israeli occupation?

1058
00:38:51.061 --> 00:38:53.226
They both at one time raised their hands like this

1059
00:38:53.226 --> 00:38:55.535
we hate it!

1060
00:38:55.893 --> 00:38:57.706
And then I knew it was a holodine,

1061
00:38:57.706 --> 00:38:59.263
and it's a collective one,

1062
00:38:59.263 --> 00:39:02.186
so it's part of the collective consciousness.

1063
00:39:02.186 --> 00:39:04.345
I said what color is it?

1064
00:39:04.671 --> 00:39:06.036
They looked at me and said, what?

1065
00:39:06.036 --> 00:39:07.455
I said what color is the hate?

1066
00:39:07.455 --> 00:39:09.481
I went into the holographic dimension,

1067
00:39:09.481 --> 00:39:12.500
and they both looked down at this thing

1068
00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:13.929
on the floor, and they said,

1069
00:39:13.929 --> 00:39:17.880
it's a great beast,

1070
00:39:17.971 --> 00:39:20.725
and it's black, and then they started to shake,

1071
00:39:20.725 --> 00:39:21.918
and then they both dropped down

1072
00:39:21.918 --> 00:39:25.235
behind the counter, and the counter shook.

1073
00:39:25.235 --> 00:39:27.560
They were so frightened it took me about 45 minutes

1074
00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.619
to an hour just to get them calmed down

1075
00:39:29.619 --> 00:39:31.090
enough so I could talk with them,

1076
00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:32.573
but I immediately went down and sat

1077
00:39:32.573 --> 00:39:35.005
right beside them and took hold of both of them.

1078
00:39:35.005 --> 00:39:38.279
I stated my place of peace, and they were just

1079
00:39:38.279 --> 00:39:41.181
and finally they came out, and they said,

1080
00:39:41.181 --> 00:39:43.015
it's the great beast.

1081
00:39:43.015 --> 00:39:44.551
We cannot look upon the beast.

1082
00:39:44.551 --> 00:39:46.780
We'll lose our souls if we look upon the beast,

1083
00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:47.804
and they meant it.

1084
00:39:47.804 --> 00:39:49.052
Now these two guys
<v Woman>Cultural programming</v>

1085
00:39:49.052 --> 00:39:52.497
<v ->And they're what you call terrorist now.</v>

1086
00:39:52.497 --> 00:39:55.718
These are guys since five and six years of age,

1087
00:39:55.718 --> 00:39:57.905
and you think hmm.

1088
00:39:57.905 --> 00:40:00.849
Okay, so how can we approach a great

1089
00:40:00.849 --> 00:40:03.242
beast that they cannot look upon,

1090
00:40:03.782 --> 00:40:05.749
and it was so simple.

1091
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:09.717
It took us about an hour and a half to figure out,

1092
00:40:10.117 --> 00:40:12.837
because we tried and that and whatever.

1093
00:40:12.837 --> 00:40:14.560
Anyway we got down to how to Allah feel

1094
00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.895
about the great beast?

1095
00:40:16.922 --> 00:40:18.474
Oh well Allah loves everything.

1096
00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:21.769
How can Allah love the great beast?

1097
00:40:23.194 --> 00:40:24.420
I don't know.

1098
00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:26.607
Do you think if you wrapped yourself in the

1099
00:40:26.607 --> 00:40:29.860
love of Allah and looked through the eyes of Allah

1100
00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.236
you might be able to discover what is

1101
00:40:31.236 --> 00:40:33.203
lovable about the great beast?

1102
00:40:35.108 --> 00:40:36.452
Hmm, and they thought about that.

1103
00:40:36.452 --> 00:40:38.201
They're pretty adventurous guys,

1104
00:40:38.201 --> 00:40:40.238
so they decided to do that.

1105
00:40:40.238 --> 00:40:41.934
Wrapped themselves in the love Allah,

1106
00:40:41.934 --> 00:40:42.862
looked through the eyes,

1107
00:40:42.862 --> 00:40:44.089
they peak up over the counter, they look back

1108
00:40:44.089 --> 00:40:45.742
down at that piece of floor,

1109
00:40:45.742 --> 00:40:47.293
and then they said,

1110
00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:50.237
Allah loves it.

1111
00:40:51.363 --> 00:40:53.426
Ask it what it wants.

1112
00:40:54.243 --> 00:40:55.933
What do you want?

1113
00:40:56.728 --> 00:40:57.517
And then they both went

1114
00:40:57.517 --> 00:40:58.189
(gasp)

1115
00:40:58.189 --> 00:40:59.277
And they they dropped back down again,

1116
00:40:59.277 --> 00:41:00.717
and it took me another 30 40 minutes,

1117
00:41:00.717 --> 00:41:02.626
got them back out then and said

1118
00:41:02.626 --> 00:41:03.458
what does it want?

1119
00:41:03.458 --> 00:41:04.386
It wants to consume us.

1120
00:41:04.386 --> 00:41:05.506
Oh, great, okay great,

1121
00:41:05.506 --> 00:41:06.754
and what'll happen if it consumes you?

1122
00:41:06.754 --> 00:41:07.522
We don't know.

1123
00:41:07.522 --> 00:41:08.706
Ask again.

1124
00:41:08.706 --> 00:41:10.577
Okay, what else do you want?

1125
00:41:10.796 --> 00:41:12.332
We wanna consume all of Palestine.

1126
00:41:12.332 --> 00:41:13.185
Ahhh,

1127
00:41:13.185 --> 00:41:14.999
they're scared again for only a few more minutes this time

1128
00:41:14.999 --> 00:41:16.225
kind of wore down a little,

1129
00:41:16.225 --> 00:41:17.740
and then finally they said, what else?

1130
00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:21.409
And the beast says we wanna consume Israel.

1131
00:41:21.409 --> 00:41:22.593
They look at each other and say Israel,

1132
00:41:22.593 --> 00:41:23.681
how come it wants to consume,

1133
00:41:23.681 --> 00:41:25.099
me, you, Palestine, yeah,

1134
00:41:25.099 --> 00:41:26.055
but what about Israel.

1135
00:41:26.295 --> 00:41:27.225
Ask it!

1136
00:41:27.225 --> 00:41:28.726
What else?

1137
00:41:28.726 --> 00:41:30.448
We wanna consume all life,

1138
00:41:30.891 --> 00:41:32.512
and I said well, if it consumes all life

1139
00:41:32.512 --> 00:41:33.925
what happens?

1140
00:41:34.091 --> 00:41:36.485
I'm still in this holographic dimension right?

1141
00:41:37.088 --> 00:41:39.898
Says he gets peace.

1142
00:41:41.568 --> 00:41:44.047
So what this thing really wants is peace.

1143
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:45.535
It wants peace, peace,

1144
00:41:45.535 --> 00:41:48.138
yeah, because then it wouldn't have to have

1145
00:41:48.138 --> 00:41:50.719
any conflict because life causes conflictry.

1146
00:41:50.719 --> 00:41:52.532
Do you think this thing is really very mature?

1147
00:41:52.532 --> 00:41:53.247
Mature?

1148
00:41:53.247 --> 00:41:53.919
What do you mean?

1149
00:41:53.919 --> 00:41:55.103
So we had this talk about what maturity is

1150
00:41:55.103 --> 00:41:57.891
and how come it's different,

1151
00:41:58.356 --> 00:42:00.404
and maybe there's another way that it could do this,

1152
00:42:00.404 --> 00:42:03.107
it could get peace, so then I said to them,

1153
00:42:03.188 --> 00:42:04.579
what does peace look like?

1154
00:42:05.065 --> 00:42:07.011
Oh, that's easy.

1155
00:42:07.059 --> 00:42:08.137
First they had a little bit of trouble,

1156
00:42:08.137 --> 00:42:09.289
but they finally got it.

1157
00:42:09.289 --> 00:42:12.168
Then they said so what would it be like if you

1158
00:42:12.168 --> 00:42:13.544
were in that peace?

1159
00:42:13.544 --> 00:42:17.213
A complete change comes over these guys.

1160
00:42:17.213 --> 00:42:18.717
They get up and they start dancing around and say,

1161
00:42:18.717 --> 00:42:20.482
this is great.

1162
00:42:20.531 --> 00:42:24.748
I say, now introduce the beast to the peace.

1163
00:42:25.736 --> 00:42:28.167
It's the peace it's always wanted.

1164
00:42:28.167 --> 00:42:31.069
Why not just introduce it in your own self first?

1165
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:33.276
You're gonna organize this from smallness

1166
00:42:33.276 --> 00:42:34.614
to bigness.

1167
00:42:35.324 --> 00:42:38.919
They did it, and they became so celebrated,

1168
00:42:38.919 --> 00:42:41.895
because the beast transformed itself into their peace,

1169
00:42:41.895 --> 00:42:44.913
which they called the river of life.

1170
00:42:44.913 --> 00:42:48.806
It's a flowing river of endless love and life,

1171
00:42:48.806 --> 00:42:50.459
and they started to prophesy,

1172
00:42:50.459 --> 00:42:52.390
and they were up dancing around

1173
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:55.472
the room prophesying things like,

1174
00:42:55.472 --> 00:43:00.472
oh, every foot that has stepped upon this land

1175
00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:02.817
was brought by God to be here.

1176
00:43:03.239 --> 00:43:06.572
I'm going, these are these Palestinian terrorists,

1177
00:43:06.674 --> 00:43:10.066
and Palestinians brought a witness

1178
00:43:10.066 --> 00:43:13.521
to the nations of the all powerful unity

1179
00:43:13.521 --> 00:43:14.983
of everything and everyone.

1180
00:43:14.983 --> 00:43:17.148
I never told them any of this,

1181
00:43:17.148 --> 00:43:19.558
and they're coming out with all these amazing things

1182
00:43:19.558 --> 00:43:20.700
that you could have written down,

1183
00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.481
and they would have been holy books

1184
00:43:22.481 --> 00:43:23.638
from then on.

1185
00:43:23.761 --> 00:43:28.491
Amazing stuff out of these two terrorists, right?

1186
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:30.982
Then one of them stopped and said,

1187
00:43:30.982 --> 00:43:33.051
who are you?

1188
00:43:33.051 --> 00:43:33.840
<v Woman>Santa Claus!</v>

1189
00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.856
<v ->I said, no, my names Vernon.</v>

1190
00:43:35.856 --> 00:43:36.741
Vernon!

1191
00:43:36.741 --> 00:43:37.573
Vernon, he says.

1192
00:43:37.573 --> 00:43:38.896
That's a terrible name.

1193
00:43:38.896 --> 00:43:40.528
It's not Arabic, come with us.

1194
00:43:40.528 --> 00:43:42.516
They took me back to this well,

1195
00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:45.263
and they said this is the well of Virage.

1196
00:43:45.263 --> 00:43:46.170
Should not be a well here so Virage has

1197
00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:47.983
been here 6,000 years.

1198
00:43:47.983 --> 00:43:49.391
My family has been in this,

1199
00:43:49.391 --> 00:43:52.623
this part of the store for 6,000 years.

1200
00:43:52.623 --> 00:43:56.729
He says, so anything that has a hidden

1201
00:43:56.729 --> 00:43:58.820
there's not supposed to be any water here,

1202
00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:00.217
shouldn't be any water here.

1203
00:44:00.217 --> 00:44:01.166
Has hidden water,

1204
00:44:01.166 --> 00:44:02.190
you don't know where it comes from,

1205
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:04.185
or a hidden solution, you didn't know what it was,

1206
00:44:04.185 --> 00:44:06.371
or a hidden door is called virage

1207
00:44:06.371 --> 00:44:08.110
in Arabic.

1208
00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:10.216
They said we want to give you a new name.

1209
00:44:10.243 --> 00:44:12.472
They dressed me up in an Arabic costume

1210
00:44:12.472 --> 00:44:16.675
with a little plaid turban on me,

1211
00:44:16.675 --> 00:44:20.253
gave me a staff and named me Virage,

1212
00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.962
and this will be your Arab name,

1213
00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:25.746
because you give solutions where none are evident,

1214
00:44:26.125 --> 00:44:28.700
and then my adventures began,

1215
00:44:29.378 --> 00:44:31.289
because it was after 11 o'clock.

1216
00:44:31.289 --> 00:44:32.655
<v Woman>Uh oh, and I was going to say,</v>

1217
00:44:32.655 --> 00:44:34.628
meanwhile back at the ranch they must have

1218
00:44:34.628 --> 00:44:35.825
wondered what in the heck happened to you.

1219
00:44:35.825 --> 00:44:37.147
<v ->They did not have a clue where I was,</v>

1220
00:44:37.147 --> 00:44:38.075
and they were worried,

1221
00:44:38.075 --> 00:44:40.085
and everything, and so now

1222
00:44:40.123 --> 00:44:43.227
the Israelis are in war mode and it's after 11,

1223
00:44:43.227 --> 00:44:46.181
and they said to me, well where are you staying,

1224
00:44:46.181 --> 00:44:48.061
and I said, I don't know.

1225
00:44:48.061 --> 00:44:49.875
I couldn't remember,

1226
00:44:49.875 --> 00:44:51.378
because I got there so late that I forgot

1227
00:44:51.378 --> 00:44:52.680
it was early the next morning.

1228
00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:53.448
I hadn't even looked at,

1229
00:44:53.448 --> 00:44:54.674
but I had to glance back and notice it

1230
00:44:54.674 --> 00:44:57.089
was some kind of castle hotel,

1231
00:44:57.095 --> 00:44:58.599
and they said, oh we know that one,

1232
00:44:58.599 --> 00:44:59.576
and I said yeah, but how are you

1233
00:44:59.576 --> 00:45:00.100
gonna get me there?

1234
00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:01.666
Oh, don't worry we know how to do this.

1235
00:45:01.704 --> 00:45:04.067
Here's my first night,

1236
00:45:04.067 --> 00:45:05.902
my second night actually in Israel,

1237
00:45:05.902 --> 00:45:07.565
and we're going down the streets,

1238
00:45:07.565 --> 00:45:10.051
and there one guys going ahead of the others,

1239
00:45:10.051 --> 00:45:11.331
making sure we're all safe here,

1240
00:45:11.331 --> 00:45:13.026
goes ahead and says, okay, come on.

1241
00:45:13.026 --> 00:45:15.298
I made it all the way through the old city,

1242
00:45:15.298 --> 00:45:16.994
all the way into the lighted area,

1243
00:45:16.994 --> 00:45:18.925
all the way across the street into the hotel.

1244
00:45:18.925 --> 00:45:20.796
They walked me right to my door,

1245
00:45:21.133 --> 00:45:22.727
and they said,

1246
00:45:23.724 --> 00:45:24.844
we would like to do this again

1247
00:45:24.844 --> 00:45:25.794
tomorrow night at 11.

1248
00:45:25.794 --> 00:45:27.234
We have something we think you need to do.

1249
00:45:28.524 --> 00:45:29.691
I said okay.

1250
00:45:31.873 --> 00:45:34.747
<v Woman>Where were your handlers at this point?</v>

1251
00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.638
<v ->I never had any.</v>

1252
00:45:37.942 --> 00:45:39.301
<v Woman>Just teasing.</v>

1253
00:45:39.382 --> 00:45:41.953
<v ->Anyway, so they got me the next morning.</v>

1254
00:45:41.953 --> 00:45:43.137
We got on the little blue bus again,

1255
00:45:43.137 --> 00:45:44.139
and we're going all over,

1256
00:45:44.139 --> 00:45:45.600
and I haven't told anybody, because

1257
00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.478
I don't want really anybody to know what I'm doing

1258
00:45:47.478 --> 00:45:48.709
with these guys.

1259
00:45:48.779 --> 00:45:50.944
The next night, 11 o'clock,

1260
00:45:50.944 --> 00:45:52.399
knock on my door.

1261
00:45:52.405 --> 00:45:54.053
11 o'clock.

1262
00:45:54.123 --> 00:45:55.930
Come on, rog, let's go.

1263
00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:58.368
Sneak out, go in this little old car

1264
00:45:58.368 --> 00:46:00.853
down to the part of the Arab system that's

1265
00:46:00.853 --> 00:46:04.149
part of the city is hardly lit,

1266
00:46:04.149 --> 00:46:05.450
because the Jewish people don't

1267
00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:08.010
let the Arab people have electricity much,

1268
00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:09.770
so there's very little electricity,

1269
00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:11.519
took me to house that had some,

1270
00:46:11.519 --> 00:46:13.183
and brought me inside,

1271
00:46:13.183 --> 00:46:17.038
and here's a woman and seven children,

1272
00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:21.219
and the oldest is about 14,

1273
00:46:21.801 --> 00:46:25.528
and she's very frightened and so are the children

1274
00:46:26.025 --> 00:46:29.299
and my two firage brothers.

1275
00:46:29.299 --> 00:46:31.368
I call them firage just means

1276
00:46:31.368 --> 00:46:32.851
all brothers of the same family.

1277
00:46:32.851 --> 00:46:36.631
They said, where's Hommad?

1278
00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.415
My mother says he's coming.

1279
00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:41.879
And so in walks this boy.

1280
00:46:41.906 --> 00:46:44.743
He looks like a high school football player.

1281
00:46:44.743 --> 00:46:47.453
He's big and he's husky,

1282
00:46:47.453 --> 00:46:50.428
robust, and he walks with one foot

1283
00:46:50.428 --> 00:46:54.119
on his ankle and both his hands are crunched up

1284
00:46:54.119 --> 00:46:57.532
like this and held against his chest like this,

1285
00:46:57.532 --> 00:46:59.616
but he's very intelligent,

1286
00:46:59.782 --> 00:47:04.102
and my firage brother says, the oldest one says,

1287
00:47:04.102 --> 00:47:07.861
this man is one of the pathological terrorists.

1288
00:47:08.049 --> 00:47:10.346
He cannot stop killing Israelis,

1289
00:47:10.982 --> 00:47:13.019
and he's now a danger to himself and

1290
00:47:13.019 --> 00:47:14.875
to his people.

1291
00:47:14.875 --> 00:47:16.725
Can you help him?

1292
00:47:18.288 --> 00:47:22.815
Here I am, in the middle of the night,

1293
00:47:23.098 --> 00:47:25.578
in the middle of the Arab territory,

1294
00:47:25.957 --> 00:47:27.930
and helping a young man

1295
00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:32.154
whose obviously had some real trouble.

1296
00:47:32.154 --> 00:47:33.961
They explained his story.

1297
00:47:34.244 --> 00:47:36.702
The Israelis killed his father,

1298
00:47:36.889 --> 00:47:40.676
and they killed him for no reason,

1299
00:47:40.676 --> 00:47:42.414
but were not protected by law

1300
00:47:42.414 --> 00:47:44.243
so there was nothing that could be done.

1301
00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:45.902
This young man decided he was gonna do nothing

1302
00:47:45.902 --> 00:47:47.987
but kill Israelis.

1303
00:47:48.611 --> 00:47:50.120
They caught him.

1304
00:47:50.243 --> 00:47:52.654
They took him into the desert, and they put him in a place

1305
00:47:52.654 --> 00:47:56.893
too small to stand up and too small to sit down

1306
00:47:57.368 --> 00:47:58.787
in the middle of the desert,

1307
00:47:58.787 --> 00:48:01.661
and they left him for five days and five nights,

1308
00:48:01.848 --> 00:48:04.370
but first they broke his leg,

1309
00:48:04.493 --> 00:48:07.186
and they broke all of his fingers,

1310
00:48:07.448 --> 00:48:09.975
and they said that the young man showed

1311
00:48:09.975 --> 00:48:12.045
me how he can bend all of his fingers back

1312
00:48:12.045 --> 00:48:15.970
and touch his wrist, so it was really still broken,

1313
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:18.705
and they left him there,

1314
00:48:18.913 --> 00:48:20.513
and then they came back and tortured him some more,

1315
00:48:20.513 --> 00:48:24.571
and I said so how did he feel?

1316
00:48:24.993 --> 00:48:29.569
They said, they talked to him in Arabic,

1317
00:48:29.569 --> 00:48:32.246
and they said he is totally filled

1318
00:48:32.246 --> 00:48:33.584
with hate.

1319
00:48:35.232 --> 00:48:37.946
Then I said what color is it?

1320
00:48:38.251 --> 00:48:41.941
The young virage brother says oh, okay,

1321
00:48:41.941 --> 00:48:44.363
and he sits Homid down and he sits

1322
00:48:44.363 --> 00:48:47.008
right next to him, face to face,

1323
00:48:47.008 --> 00:48:50.356
grabs him by the head, pulls his head over

1324
00:48:50.356 --> 00:48:52.618
and shouts, Homid, pay attention

1325
00:48:52.618 --> 00:48:53.881
in Arabic,

1326
00:48:54.378 --> 00:48:57.588
and Homid kinda wakes up to this,

1327
00:48:57.588 --> 00:48:58.794
and just paying attention,

1328
00:48:58.794 --> 00:48:59.999
and then he looks up at me and says,

1329
00:48:59.999 --> 00:49:01.226
okay, now what?

1330
00:49:01.226 --> 00:49:03.412
Ask him the color.

1331
00:49:03.412 --> 00:49:04.457
He says okay.

1332
00:49:04.457 --> 00:49:06.889
Talk, talk, and then he says, it's black.

1333
00:49:06.889 --> 00:49:08.148
How big is it?

1334
00:49:08.148 --> 00:49:10.985
Talk, talk, talk, and he says,

1335
00:49:10.985 --> 00:49:13.299
oh it's bigger than the world.

1336
00:49:13.299 --> 00:49:14.654
It's bigger than the solar system.

1337
00:49:14.654 --> 00:49:18.125
It's as big as the galaxy .

1338
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:20.712
I smiled and said, tell Homid

1339
00:49:20.712 --> 00:49:22.701
that's really very good.

1340
00:49:23.315 --> 00:49:25.192
Homid hears that and looks up at me,

1341
00:49:25.192 --> 00:49:26.440
and says, what?

1342
00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.298
Because his love is bigger than

1343
00:49:29.298 --> 00:49:30.967
his holodine.

1344
00:49:31.293 --> 00:49:33.597
The young brother gets it,

1345
00:49:33.597 --> 00:49:35.847
and then he starts furiously talking to Homid,

1346
00:49:35.847 --> 00:49:37.639
back and forth and back and forth and back and forth,

1347
00:49:37.639 --> 00:49:40.374
and all of a sudden Homid says, oh.

1348
00:49:40.935 --> 00:49:43.996
Oh, and as soon as he did that

1349
00:49:43.996 --> 00:49:46.385
his mother and all his brothers and sisters

1350
00:49:46.385 --> 00:49:47.798
started crying.

1351
00:49:48.103 --> 00:49:49.660
They knew he got it.

1352
00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:51.942
And I knew too.

1353
00:49:51.942 --> 00:49:53.980
It was so exciting.

1354
00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:56.347
I cannot tell you how simple it is

1355
00:49:56.347 --> 00:50:00.390
to change a pathological terrorist into

1356
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:02.992
the most loving human being you could ever imagine,

1357
00:50:02.992 --> 00:50:06.779
because when Homid got it, we made the transformation

1358
00:50:06.779 --> 00:50:09.744
so that the galaxy sized blackness

1359
00:50:09.744 --> 00:50:13.605
became a bigger than that love,

1360
00:50:13.605 --> 00:50:15.248
so his love was so big,

1361
00:50:15.248 --> 00:50:16.410
and he glowed with it,

1362
00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:17.551
and his mother.

1363
00:50:17.551 --> 00:50:20.911
His brothers and sisters all gathered around him,

1364
00:50:20.911 --> 00:50:22.330
they all hugged him and everything,

1365
00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:24.100
and then he came over to give me a hug,

1366
00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:26.409
and I looked at him and took his hands,

1367
00:50:26.575 --> 00:50:29.039
and I said so what do you wanna do with these hands?

1368
00:50:29.039 --> 00:50:30.611
Do you wanna heal them?

1369
00:50:31.012 --> 00:50:32.942
And he says, oh no.

1370
00:50:32.942 --> 00:50:34.910
These are my witness

1371
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:38.365
to all the people who think they are my enemy,

1372
00:50:38.542 --> 00:50:41.763
of my unconditional love for my enemies.

1373
00:50:41.763 --> 00:50:43.496
<v Woman>Unbelievable.</v>

1374
00:50:43.598 --> 00:50:44.579
<v ->Sorry it's true.</v>

1375
00:50:44.579 --> 00:50:47.011
<v Woman>And this came through purely.</v>

1376
00:50:47.011 --> 00:50:49.709
<v ->Purely, no coaching.</v>

1377
00:50:49.709 --> 00:50:52.472
Just a pure state of transformation.

1378
00:50:52.472 --> 00:50:54.626
By the way in the middle of that whole process

1379
00:50:54.626 --> 00:50:56.141
we were bisceiged by

1380
00:50:56.141 --> 00:50:59.853
truckloads of young men who came and slammed the doors

1381
00:50:59.853 --> 00:51:01.175
and started shouting and screaming

1382
00:51:01.175 --> 00:51:02.103
out in the front,

1383
00:51:02.103 --> 00:51:04.684
and Homid and my two firage brothers went out

1384
00:51:04.684 --> 00:51:06.658
and they handled them.

1385
00:51:06.658 --> 00:51:08.215
The mother finally went out and also helped,

1386
00:51:08.215 --> 00:51:09.047
but took a half an hour.

1387
00:51:09.047 --> 00:51:11.393
Right in the middle of the transformation

1388
00:51:11.393 --> 00:51:13.804
the opposition came to find out

1389
00:51:13.804 --> 00:51:15.382
what was going on, because

1390
00:51:15.382 --> 00:51:18.401
you can sense it in the entire field,

1391
00:51:18.401 --> 00:51:20.150
because we are connected,

1392
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:23.905
and anybody whose a terrorist is me,

1393
00:51:23.905 --> 00:51:26.038
and anybody whose an anti terrorist

1394
00:51:26.038 --> 00:51:28.576
is me, because we're all connected,

1395
00:51:28.576 --> 00:51:31.061
but you have to get into another

1396
00:51:31.061 --> 00:51:34.475
dimension of reality to understand that.

1397
00:51:34.475 --> 00:51:36.580
What we teach is,

1398
00:51:36.746 --> 00:51:38.042
what's reality

1399
00:51:38.346 --> 00:51:40.160
and what are these dimensions?

1400
00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:42.154
And what happens when you get in them?

1401
00:51:42.154 --> 00:51:44.799
And how do you use that additional

1402
00:51:44.799 --> 00:51:49.369
awareness of reality in order to solve problems?

1403
00:51:49.375 --> 00:51:52.697
Every problem is caused by it's solution,

1404
00:51:53.737 --> 00:51:55.625
and the reason that every problem

1405
00:51:55.625 --> 00:51:59.054
is cased by it's solution is because of the covenant.

1406
00:51:59.689 --> 00:52:01.385
We know from science that everything

1407
00:52:01.385 --> 00:52:03.928
is made of little spinners of information,

1408
00:52:04.094 --> 00:52:06.398
that they come from hyperspace,

1409
00:52:06.398 --> 00:52:09.438
that even when the DNA is coated and created,

1410
00:52:09.438 --> 00:52:12.435
it's created by spinners from hyperspace.

1411
00:52:12.435 --> 00:52:14.845
They come and create the little places

1412
00:52:14.845 --> 00:52:16.617
where the protein strings grow,

1413
00:52:16.617 --> 00:52:18.291
and then bridge,

1414
00:52:18.291 --> 00:52:19.613
they do that in every case where

1415
00:52:19.613 --> 00:52:20.520
there's a bridge,

1416
00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.792
so you can see that hyperspace is actually

1417
00:52:22.792 --> 00:52:24.541
creating your DNA.

1418
00:52:24.541 --> 00:52:26.599
Anything you inherit and anything

1419
00:52:26.599 --> 00:52:28.093
you have modeled for you,

1420
00:52:28.093 --> 00:52:30.439
and anything that goes on in your life,

1421
00:52:30.439 --> 00:52:33.106
past, present, or future, is all apart of

1422
00:52:33.106 --> 00:52:35.847
a covenant, and what is the covenant?

1423
00:52:35.847 --> 00:52:37.206
It's our agreement.

1424
00:52:37.745 --> 00:52:39.537
We're holographic beings, and we've

1425
00:52:39.537 --> 00:52:41.809
agreed that things will look the way they do,

1426
00:52:41.809 --> 00:52:43.996
and we'll experience them the way we do

1427
00:52:43.996 --> 00:52:47.963
so that we can have a vacation from knowing,

1428
00:52:47.963 --> 00:52:49.702
a vacation from happiness,

1429
00:52:49.702 --> 00:52:52.539
a vacation from loving one another

1430
00:52:52.539 --> 00:52:54.950
and come to a place where there is no love

1431
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:56.133
and there is no happiness,

1432
00:52:56.133 --> 00:52:57.595
and there's not any knowledge,

1433
00:52:57.595 --> 00:52:59.067
and everybody is living in aggression

1434
00:52:59.067 --> 00:53:01.498
and downdraft dynamics so that we

1435
00:53:01.498 --> 00:53:02.932
can solve it all.

1436
00:53:03.472 --> 00:53:05.402
It's like we wrote our own scripts.

1437
00:53:05.402 --> 00:53:07.493
If you got a really, really, really, really tough

1438
00:53:07.493 --> 00:53:10.095
problem, congratulations it means you

1439
00:53:10.095 --> 00:53:13.252
have a really, really, really good solution,

1440
00:53:13.252 --> 00:53:15.567
and to me that's reality,

1441
00:53:15.567 --> 00:53:16.826
and it proves itself true.

1442
00:53:16.826 --> 00:53:18.681
I'm the kind of guy that goes out and says

1443
00:53:18.681 --> 00:53:20.676
that couldn't be true in this case.

1444
00:53:20.676 --> 00:53:21.935
You can't wipe out the drug problem.

1445
00:53:21.935 --> 00:53:23.460
Yeah, you can,

1446
00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:24.761
and we know how to do it.

1447
00:53:24.761 --> 00:53:26.041
You can't wipe out disease.

1448
00:53:26.041 --> 00:53:26.809
Oh yeah?

1449
00:53:26.809 --> 00:53:28.963
You can cure any disease.

1450
00:53:28.963 --> 00:53:33.145
<v Woman>Vernon, you're an unbelievable human being.</v>

1451
00:53:33.145 --> 00:53:34.243
Thank you so much for taking the time.

1453
00:53:35.726 --> 00:53:37.603
but if you get to know it, it's not

1454
00:53:37.603 --> 00:53:39.395
<v Woman>The nice thing is it is believable.</v>

1455
00:53:39.395 --> 00:53:40.280
