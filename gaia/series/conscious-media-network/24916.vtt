00:00:00.637 --> 00:00:04.247
(smooth jazzy music)

2
00:00:12.448 --> 00:00:15.125
Many of you will be familiar with the face of this guest

3
00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:16.907
from his appearances on any number

4
00:00:16.907 --> 00:00:20.279
of national television programs and Internet programs.

5
00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.626
Dr. Michael Beckwith is considered to be

6
00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:25.335
one of the top inspirational speakers in the world

7
00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:27.639
and was termed a "new thought minister".

8
00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:29.473
His journey began with the teachings

9
00:00:29.473 --> 00:00:31.116
of both the east and the west.

10
00:00:31.116 --> 00:00:33.633
What many don't know, however, is that his journey

11
00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:38.086
was not religious in nature, but mystical.

12
00:00:46.451 --> 00:00:48.130
<v Voiceover>Michael, most people have seen</v>

13
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.490
your shiny face before, either on Larry King Live,

14
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.634
The Secret, many many other places.

15
00:00:52.634 --> 00:00:54.394
YouTube. You're all over YouTube.

16
00:00:54.394 --> 00:00:57.391
And I think that you have become, in one sense,

17
00:00:57.391 --> 00:01:01.711
for people who don't join you in Los Angeles,

18
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:04.840
or via Agape Live, you've become very synonymous

19
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.536
with the film The Secret.

20
00:01:06.536 --> 00:01:10.184
And this had a certain process to it of visualization

21
00:01:10.184 --> 00:01:13.064
that was exposing, as we call it, kind of newbees

22
00:01:13.064 --> 00:01:16.200
to the whole notion of creating an outcome.

23
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.975
But your work actually goes to another level beyond that

24
00:01:19.975 --> 00:01:23.111
and I want to talk to you about the beyond The Secret.

25
00:01:23.111 --> 00:01:26.972
Going from visualiztion to visioning,

26
00:01:26.972 --> 00:01:28.892
and the distinction between the two.

27
00:01:28.892 --> 00:01:29.777
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

28
00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:32.103
You're absolutely correct, the movie The Secret

29
00:01:32.103 --> 00:01:34.020
was actually produced for beginngers.

30
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.878
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

31
00:01:34.878 --> 00:01:37.363
<v ->As Rhonda Byrne was putting that movie together</v>

32
00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:38.665
she was a little disturbed

33
00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:40.318
that she had gotten into her fifties

34
00:01:40.318 --> 00:01:42.803
and knew nothing about these universal principles.

35
00:01:42.803 --> 00:01:45.235
So she geared the movie specifically for people

36
00:01:45.235 --> 00:01:48.253
who had never heard of these particular practices

37
00:01:48.253 --> 00:01:49.160
or principles.

38
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.764
So, in my work, I've been the director of Agape

39
00:01:53.764 --> 00:01:55.673
for going on 24 years now.

40
00:01:55.673 --> 00:01:59.598
And so, we've always engaged the development of the soul,

41
00:01:59.598 --> 00:02:01.891
the embracing of the evolutionary impulse

42
00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:04.056
that governs the entire universe.

43
00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:06.883
So it's more or less we're here to evolve,

44
00:02:06.883 --> 00:02:08.995
to become our best self, to awaken,

45
00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:11.224
to move into different stages of enlightenment.

46
00:02:11.224 --> 00:02:15.778
So, in the beginning of the work there's visualization,

47
00:02:15.778 --> 00:02:19.758
which an individual sees what they think they want in life,

48
00:02:19.758 --> 00:02:21.434
has a wonderful image of it,

49
00:02:21.434 --> 00:02:24.112
has a level of emotional embracing of it,

50
00:02:24.112 --> 00:02:26.085
a feeling that it's already happening,

51
00:02:26.085 --> 00:02:27.450
walking in that awareness.

52
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.957
That's all a part of the manifestation process.

53
00:02:29.957 --> 00:02:33.210
But visioning is really another level.

54
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.578
Visioning is where instead of you imprinting

55
00:02:35.578 --> 00:02:37.999
or trying to tell the universe what you want,

56
00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:41.967
you instead are aware that there's something within you

57
00:02:41.967 --> 00:02:43.428
that's trying to emerge.

58
00:02:43.428 --> 00:02:46.446
And it's beyond your imagination, it's beyond your past,

59
00:02:46.446 --> 00:02:48.835
your history, your present perceptions,

60
00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.211
your present paradigm.

61
00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:52.505
And so you're literally putting yourself in a position

62
00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.224
to ask "What's trying to emerge in my life?"

63
00:02:55.224 --> 00:02:58.261
"What vision is held within me

64
00:02:58.261 --> 00:02:59.671
that's trying to come forward?"

65
00:02:59.671 --> 00:03:03.363
So here you enter into acts of yielding,

66
00:03:03.363 --> 00:03:08.363
surrender, releasing, letting go.

67
00:03:08.394 --> 00:03:10.448
These are more the qualities in that,

68
00:03:10.448 --> 00:03:14.352
so you find yourself being surprised, sometimes shocked

69
00:03:14.352 --> 00:03:19.034
by the good and the love and the depth of compassion

70
00:03:19.034 --> 00:03:22.148
or generosity, or genius, that's within you.

71
00:03:22.148 --> 00:03:24.708
So you're not imprinting this is what I want.

72
00:03:24.708 --> 00:03:28.207
You're asking, you know, what's trying to come forward.

73
00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:30.649
So it's actually the next stage of our work.

74
00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:32.804
<v Voiceover>This is the more mature question.</v>

75
00:03:32.804 --> 00:03:36.355
However, as western civilization is what it is,

76
00:03:36.355 --> 00:03:38.819
the first step is "I want this."

77
00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.655
"Let's just see if I can get what I want."

78
00:03:40.655 --> 00:03:41.381
<v ->Absolutely!</v>

79
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:42.528
<v Voiceover>And some people were able</v>

80
00:03:42.528 --> 00:03:46.155
to get what they want, but it's such a complex subject

81
00:03:46.155 --> 00:03:50.144
when you're dealing with these imprints, really, in utero.

82
00:03:50.144 --> 00:03:53.184
Shall we maybe even go so far as to say

83
00:03:53.184 --> 00:03:54.584
before in utero?

84
00:03:54.584 --> 00:03:55.278
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

85
00:03:55.278 --> 00:03:57.443
<v Voiceover>We have these imprints going on</v>

86
00:03:57.443 --> 00:04:00.387
and so our world view is formed

87
00:04:00.387 --> 00:04:03.202
in a very narrow and limited fashion.

88
00:04:03.202 --> 00:04:06.919
From our family, from our greater world, our tribe,

89
00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:10.431
and what you have to do

90
00:04:10.431 --> 00:04:12.875
is inspire

91
00:04:12.875 --> 00:04:14.442
not just the asking of new questions,

92
00:04:14.442 --> 00:04:18.761
but the daring, it seems to me, to have a larger vision.

93
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:19.625
<v ->Oh, absolutely.</v>

94
00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:21.556
<v Voiceover>So let's talk about how you begin</v>

95
00:04:21.556 --> 00:04:22.271
guiding people.

96
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:25.033
Let's talk about you, how you did that for you

97
00:04:25.033 --> 00:04:25.772
in the very beginning.

98
00:04:25.772 --> 00:04:26.320
(Michael laughs)

99
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.377
<v Voiceover>I wanna know about you.</v>

100
00:04:27.377 --> 00:04:28.176
<v ->Oh, that's interesting.</v>

101
00:04:28.176 --> 00:04:30.542
Well, we'd have to go back about 30 years.

102
00:04:30.542 --> 00:04:31.339
<v Voiceover>Let's do it.</v>

103
00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:33.408
<v ->And, um, you know, as a child</v>

104
00:04:33.408 --> 00:04:35.382
I had different openings and different experiences

105
00:04:35.382 --> 00:04:39.967
but I wasn't able to hold that particular world view.

106
00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:43.276
But as I was attending USC

107
00:04:43.276 --> 00:04:46.572
I began to have these inner experiences

108
00:04:46.572 --> 00:04:49.451
and seeing things that,

109
00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:52.310
because I was in the psychobiology department,

110
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.187
these were deemed pathological.

111
00:04:54.187 --> 00:04:55.760
Seeing visions, hearing voices,

112
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.404
things of this particular nature.

113
00:04:56.404 --> 00:04:57.036
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

114
00:04:57.036 --> 00:04:58.846
<v ->And this is back in the seventies</v>

115
00:04:58.846 --> 00:05:03.599
so, I thought I was literally losing my mind.

116
00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:04.588
<v Voiceover>Well, what kind of things were you seeing?</v>

117
00:05:04.588 --> 00:05:05.846
What made you feel that way?

118
00:05:05.846 --> 00:05:07.862
<v ->Well, for instance, I would come home,</v>

119
00:05:07.862 --> 00:05:09.281
let's say I'd be looking at television,

120
00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:11.606
suddenly I'd be on my ceiling, looking down at myself

121
00:05:11.606 --> 00:05:13.607
look at television.

122
00:05:13.607 --> 00:05:15.380
Or I would think about my mother

123
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.546
and the next thing I know I'm in her kitchen

124
00:05:17.546 --> 00:05:19.298
looking at her cook.

125
00:05:19.298 --> 00:05:21.596
<v Voiceover>You were having kind of out of body,</v>

126
00:05:21.596 --> 00:05:22.859
or astral travel experiences.

127
00:05:22.859 --> 00:05:27.233
<v ->Out of body experiences, dreams, prophetic dreams.</v>

128
00:05:27.233 --> 00:05:30.582
All of this was going on at a very intense,

129
00:05:30.582 --> 00:05:31.669
it was very intense, time.

130
00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.390
I mean, every night was an adventure when I went to sleep.

131
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.928
I didn't know what was going to happen.

132
00:05:36.928 --> 00:05:39.647
But because I had no spiritual background

133
00:05:39.647 --> 00:05:41.439
or spiritual practice, I didn't know

134
00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:44.042
these were somewhat common experiences

135
00:05:44.042 --> 00:05:45.898
that you could grow into.

136
00:05:45.898 --> 00:05:47.423
I didn't know what they were.

137
00:05:47.423 --> 00:05:49.929
I just thought I was losing my mind to a degree.

138
00:05:49.929 --> 00:05:53.161
I could remember being in one of my psych classes

139
00:05:53.161 --> 00:05:55.369
and I was watching to teacher teach

140
00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:57.460
and suddenly I saw all these spirits around him,

141
00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.873
jumping in and out of his body as he was teaching.

142
00:05:59.873 --> 00:06:00.855
He was very animated.

143
00:06:00.855 --> 00:06:03.308
He was teaching and I was looking

144
00:06:03.308 --> 00:06:05.374
and I said to my friend next to me,

145
00:06:05.374 --> 00:06:06.689
I said "Do you see that?"

146
00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:07.547
And he said "What?"

147
00:06:07.547 --> 00:06:09.001
I said "All those beings jumping in and out of the teacher."

148
00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:10.687
And he looked at me like

149
00:06:10.687 --> 00:06:12.265
"Man, have you lost your mind?"

150
00:06:12.265 --> 00:06:13.204
"I don't see anything."

151
00:06:13.204 --> 00:06:16.638
And so I thought I was losing it.

152
00:06:16.638 --> 00:06:18.771
And I was doing an internship program

153
00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:22.583
with individuals who were in mental institutions.

154
00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:23.443
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

155
00:06:23.443 --> 00:06:25.347
<v ->And I can remember going in one time,</v>

156
00:06:25.347 --> 00:06:27.513
I was working with this young man who was in there,

157
00:06:27.513 --> 00:06:29.017
and we were playing ping pong

158
00:06:29.017 --> 00:06:31.203
and I was asking him why he was inside.

159
00:06:31.203 --> 00:06:32.884
And he says "Oh, you know, I have these visions

160
00:06:32.884 --> 00:06:34.089
and I see things."

161
00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:37.363
And he began to describe some of my own experiences

162
00:06:37.363 --> 00:06:38.942
except he's locked up.

163
00:06:38.942 --> 00:06:40.063
<v Voiceover>This is the problem, isn't it?</v>

164
00:06:40.063 --> 00:06:40.593
<v ->Yeah!</v>

165
00:06:40.593 --> 00:06:41.328
<v Voiceover>It's a big problem,</v>

166
00:06:41.328 --> 00:06:42.282
with a lot of people locked up.

167
00:06:42.282 --> 00:06:46.064
<v ->Right. And so about three or four minutes we were talking</v>

168
00:06:46.064 --> 00:06:48.741
and then I realized we weren't talking.

169
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:50.820
It was telepathy.

170
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.127
And I remember putting the ping pong paddle down

171
00:06:54.127 --> 00:06:55.962
and walking out, checking out.

172
00:06:55.962 --> 00:06:56.943
(interviewer laughs)

173
00:06:56.943 --> 00:06:58.777
<v ->I said I am not going to be stuck in here.</v>

174
00:06:58.777 --> 00:07:02.233
So, anyway, this culminated with an experience.

175
00:07:02.233 --> 00:07:04.142
I had a series of dreams in which,

176
00:07:04.142 --> 00:07:06.990
and this is somewhat described to a limited degree

177
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.062
in my book and the movie Spiritual Liberation,

178
00:07:10.062 --> 00:07:13.697
but I was chased by these three men.

179
00:07:13.697 --> 00:07:14.755
I had this dream almost every night

180
00:07:14.755 --> 00:07:16.334
for almost a year.

181
00:07:16.334 --> 00:07:18.030
And one night in the dream,

182
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.178
this is a very lucid dream, I'm conscious in this dream,

183
00:07:21.178 --> 00:07:24.286
and I was tired, I said "I'm not gonna run anymore"

184
00:07:24.286 --> 00:07:25.770
and I turned around and I saw these three men

185
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.020
approaching, and I turned behind me

186
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.529
and there was this small tent

187
00:07:29.529 --> 00:07:31.879
with this long line of people

188
00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:34.726
trying to get into a small tent.

189
00:07:34.726 --> 00:07:36.130
And interestingly enough,

190
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.063
I knew all of these people in line.

191
00:07:39.063 --> 00:07:42.167
And so I started screaming to them to help me.

192
00:07:42.167 --> 00:07:44.279
And one by one they turned their back on me.

193
00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:46.742
Two of the men held me down

194
00:07:46.742 --> 00:07:49.761
and the other plunged a knife into my heart.

195
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:52.801
The pain was excruciating, physically.

196
00:07:52.801 --> 00:07:54.017
I mean, really.

197
00:07:54.017 --> 00:07:58.754
I screamed out and I died

198
00:07:58.754 --> 00:08:01.623
and when I woke up, things were different.

199
00:08:01.623 --> 00:08:03.373
I was different.

200
00:08:03.373 --> 00:08:05.858
I could see that we were surrounded

201
00:08:05.858 --> 00:08:07.778
by this universal presence.

202
00:08:07.778 --> 00:08:11.521
And I called the presence love-beauty.

203
00:08:11.521 --> 00:08:13.015
I wasn't using the name God yet

204
00:08:13.015 --> 00:08:14.775
because I was somewhat agnostic

205
00:08:14.775 --> 00:08:16.545
at that time in my life.

206
00:08:16.545 --> 00:08:19.937
So, but the love was so penetrating in my being.

207
00:08:19.937 --> 00:08:22.881
I'd never ever experienced anything to that depth

208
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:25.718
or richness, and I knew I was totally loved

209
00:08:25.718 --> 00:08:26.923
by this presence.

210
00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:29.782
And the beauty of what I could see,

211
00:08:29.782 --> 00:08:32.075
this presence being everywhere,

212
00:08:32.075 --> 00:08:34.859
in animate and inanimate objects.

213
00:08:34.859 --> 00:08:38.250
The love and the beauty was just so overwhelming

214
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.832
and I got up from that experience

215
00:08:40.832 --> 00:08:42.293
and I went on a search

216
00:08:42.293 --> 00:08:43.997
to discover what had happened to me.

217
00:08:43.997 --> 00:08:47.602
And that's when I bumped into eastern and western mysticism

218
00:08:47.602 --> 00:08:51.015
and began to understand the universal teachings

219
00:08:51.015 --> 00:08:53.751
from this wider paradigm.

220
00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:55.755
And I never got back in the box.

221
00:08:55.755 --> 00:08:59.621
When I was stabbed in the heart and woke up

222
00:08:59.621 --> 00:09:02.339
I lost every single friend I had, just about.

223
00:09:02.339 --> 00:09:05.453
They all thought I had freaked out, lost my mind,

224
00:09:05.453 --> 00:09:08.354
because I was very aware that there was only one life,

225
00:09:08.354 --> 00:09:09.378
there was this one presence.

226
00:09:09.378 --> 00:09:10.936
It was everywhere in everything.

227
00:09:10.936 --> 00:09:13.250
We had never died, we were never born,

228
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:14.807
we were gonna live forever.

229
00:09:14.807 --> 00:09:17.726
You know, I was aware of all these sacred truths

230
00:09:17.726 --> 00:09:19.451
of what was real, what was essential.

231
00:09:19.451 --> 00:09:23.694
And the fire that I had

232
00:09:23.694 --> 00:09:25.369
those years ago

233
00:09:25.369 --> 00:09:27.256
to discover what had happened to me

234
00:09:27.256 --> 00:09:29.485
and to go into deeper states of awareness,

235
00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:31.629
I still have the same fire now.

236
00:09:31.629 --> 00:09:33.323
There's been no abating

237
00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:38.233
of that kind of intense desire to search and serve.

238
00:09:38.233 --> 00:09:39.738
<v Voiceover>As you were saying this</v>

239
00:09:39.738 --> 00:09:43.740
I was getting chills throughout my body.

240
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.103
I'm sure it's quite easy for you now in hindsight

241
00:09:47.103 --> 00:09:49.108
to be able to articulate what part of you

242
00:09:49.108 --> 00:09:51.359
had to die that night in the dream.

243
00:09:51.359 --> 00:09:54.199
<v ->Uh, so much died in me.</v>

244
00:09:54.199 --> 00:09:58.263
Fear died at that moment.

245
00:09:58.263 --> 00:10:00.658
You know, the ego's always projecting into the future

246
00:10:00.658 --> 00:10:01.659
"What's going to happen to me?'

247
00:10:01.659 --> 00:10:04.229
"How am I going to make it work?"

248
00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:05.627
Whatever the case may be.

249
00:10:05.627 --> 00:10:07.184
And when I came out of that

250
00:10:07.184 --> 00:10:09.477
I had no fear about anything.

251
00:10:09.477 --> 00:10:11.664
It was just a fearlessness.

252
00:10:11.664 --> 00:10:14.106
And I can remember looking at human beings

253
00:10:14.106 --> 00:10:16.538
and they were very concerned about money

254
00:10:16.538 --> 00:10:17.839
and concerned about so many things

255
00:10:17.839 --> 00:10:20.346
and it was almost comical to me.

256
00:10:20.346 --> 00:10:21.572
I said "Why is everybody so concerned

257
00:10:21.572 --> 00:10:23.386
about the nonessentials?"

258
00:10:23.386 --> 00:10:25.924
I remember that was part of my conversation

259
00:10:25.924 --> 00:10:27.823
back in those days, you know,

260
00:10:27.823 --> 00:10:30.798
and there was just an overhwelming desire

261
00:10:30.798 --> 00:10:33.956
to discover who and what I was

262
00:10:33.956 --> 00:10:37.433
and to give what I was supposed to give

263
00:10:37.433 --> 00:10:38.617
while I was here.

264
00:10:38.617 --> 00:10:41.262
It was almost like, during this limited time

265
00:10:41.262 --> 00:10:42.702
we have in this incarnation,

266
00:10:42.702 --> 00:10:45.773
we must give as much as we can.

267
00:10:45.773 --> 00:10:50.549
You know, leave nothing behind before we leave.

268
00:10:50.549 --> 00:10:54.528
So, so much died, it'd be difficult to think about it now

269
00:10:54.528 --> 00:10:58.261
but any sense of skepticism,

270
00:10:58.261 --> 00:11:02.428
cynicism, jadedness,

271
00:11:02.428 --> 00:11:05.067
defense mechanisms, places where the heart

272
00:11:05.067 --> 00:11:08.086
had grown protective of itself.

273
00:11:08.086 --> 00:11:10.966
All of that seemed to crumble.

274
00:11:10.966 --> 00:11:13.211
<v Voiceover>So it was like the big F encompasses it all.</v>

275
00:11:13.211 --> 00:11:13.719
Fear.

276
00:11:13.719 --> 00:11:14.559
<v ->Yes.</v>

277
00:11:14.559 --> 00:11:16.096
<v Voiceover>All of those things are predicated upon fear.</v>

278
00:11:16.096 --> 00:11:16.746
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

279
00:11:16.746 --> 00:11:17.738
<v Voiceover>So you lost the fear.</v>

280
00:11:17.738 --> 00:11:18.581
<v ->Lost the fear.</v>

281
00:11:18.581 --> 00:11:19.882
<v Voiceover>What an incredible gift.</v>

282
00:11:19.882 --> 00:11:21.525
I mean, to go through that

283
00:11:21.525 --> 00:11:23.871
and all of the kind of self-doubts

284
00:11:23.871 --> 00:11:26.239
prior to that, through the educational system,

285
00:11:26.239 --> 00:11:27.652
the experiences you were having,

286
00:11:27.652 --> 00:11:28.985
to have blasted through.

287
00:11:28.985 --> 00:11:31.812
Now how much time elapsed after that

288
00:11:31.812 --> 00:11:34.851
before you really realized you have to do something.

289
00:11:34.851 --> 00:11:36.846
You have to help others in this way.

290
00:11:36.846 --> 00:11:40.662
How did you start forging

291
00:11:40.662 --> 00:11:42.742
even a means of articulating this

292
00:11:42.742 --> 00:11:44.983
and then launch into sharing with others?

293
00:11:44.983 --> 00:11:47.829
<v ->Right, the articulation wasn't that good at the beginning.</v>

294
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:51.048
It took a couple of years to just integrate

295
00:11:51.048 --> 00:11:53.524
what had happened, and what continued to happen to me.

296
00:11:53.524 --> 00:11:55.188
That one experience was an opening,

297
00:11:55.188 --> 00:11:57.910
but I had many others.

298
00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.538
There was a period of years when I would go into white light

299
00:12:00.538 --> 00:12:04.080
and be bombarded with tremendous information

300
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.530
and knowledge.

301
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.479
And there was not anyone to talk to about this.

302
00:12:08.479 --> 00:12:09.503
<v Voiceover>That's right.</v>

303
00:12:09.503 --> 00:12:10.482
<v ->This was very weird.</v>

304
00:12:10.482 --> 00:12:13.554
And fortunately a lot of the dead mystics were my friends.

305
00:12:13.554 --> 00:12:16.031
I would read the stories of these individuals.

306
00:12:16.031 --> 00:12:17.044
"Oh, that's what it is!"

307
00:12:17.044 --> 00:12:18.932
You know, I studied Walter Russell,

308
00:12:18.932 --> 00:12:21.642
where he was taken into a very expanded cosmic awareness

309
00:12:21.642 --> 00:12:23.040
and I'd say "Oh, that's what that is!"

310
00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.128
and different people,

311
00:12:24.128 --> 00:12:26.751
so I became aware of that.

312
00:12:26.751 --> 00:12:30.039
But it took a few years to integrate,

313
00:12:30.039 --> 00:12:32.351
because I went through a period of time

314
00:12:32.351 --> 00:12:34.783
where I did no care about the earthly incarnation.

315
00:12:34.783 --> 00:12:36.661
You know, and that's not good either.

316
00:12:36.661 --> 00:12:37.732
You can go to one extreme--

317
00:12:37.732 --> 00:12:38.830
<v Voiceover>Right, but it seems the natural extension</v>

318
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:39.574
of that kind of--

319
00:12:39.574 --> 00:12:40.191
<v ->Yes.</v>

320
00:12:40.191 --> 00:12:41.278
<v Voiceover>Enlightened experience.</v>

321
00:12:41.278 --> 00:12:42.707
<v ->Yes, and so I didn't care.</v>

322
00:12:42.707 --> 00:12:45.331
I mean, I was much skinnier than I am now.

323
00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:46.451
Like 118 pounds.

324
00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:47.795
I didn't eat, you know.

325
00:12:47.795 --> 00:12:51.138
I fasted all the time, meditated all the time.

326
00:12:51.138 --> 00:12:53.016
What people were concerned about in the world

327
00:12:53.016 --> 00:12:54.040
I was unconcerned about that.

328
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.854
I was really no earthly good.

329
00:12:55.854 --> 00:12:58.749
But I was very exalted in this other state.

330
00:12:58.749 --> 00:13:03.674
And I had a family,

331
00:13:03.674 --> 00:13:05.205
and so they were waiting for me

332
00:13:05.205 --> 00:13:06.495
to get on with it, you know.

333
00:13:06.495 --> 00:13:07.402
<v Voiceover>Yeah, I bet.</v>

334
00:13:07.402 --> 00:13:09.191
<v ->You know, I'd been in college</v>

335
00:13:09.191 --> 00:13:12.465
and so I started to get back into the work force

336
00:13:12.465 --> 00:13:16.540
and I was kinda the weird one at work, you know.

337
00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:21.503
And then I can remember, it was a period of time

338
00:13:21.503 --> 00:13:22.615
before that happened,

339
00:13:22.615 --> 00:13:26.092
I said "Okay, what do you want me to do with my life?"

340
00:13:26.092 --> 00:13:27.116
I was sitting in my living room,

341
00:13:27.116 --> 00:13:28.513
I said "What do you want me to do?"

342
00:13:28.513 --> 00:13:31.201
You know, I see so much, I feel so much,

343
00:13:31.201 --> 00:13:32.481
I love humanity.

344
00:13:32.481 --> 00:13:34.974
And I didn't want to be a minister

345
00:13:34.974 --> 00:13:36.707
because in the old paradigm,

346
00:13:36.707 --> 00:13:40.216
the way I looked at ministers was not a good perception.

347
00:13:40.216 --> 00:13:42.637
Because I didn't believe what they were saying,

348
00:13:42.637 --> 00:13:44.834
so I was wondering how these people could stand up

349
00:13:44.834 --> 00:13:47.932
and talk about hell and original sins

350
00:13:47.932 --> 00:13:50.119
and all this stuff, and be believable.

351
00:13:50.119 --> 00:13:52.999
So I'm sitting in my living room

352
00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:54.876
and I said "Okay, what do you want me to do?"

353
00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:56.220
And the phone rang.

354
00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.948
And it was this lady on the phone

355
00:13:57.948 --> 00:13:59.708
who I had not seen since high school

356
00:13:59.708 --> 00:14:01.862
and she said "Is this Michael Beckwith?"

357
00:14:01.862 --> 00:14:02.630
I said "Yes."

358
00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.211
She said "I saw your phone number in the annual,

359
00:14:05.211 --> 00:14:07.067
our high school annual, when we graduated.

360
00:14:07.067 --> 00:14:09.392
And I was just guided to call you.

361
00:14:09.392 --> 00:14:10.576
I think you can help me."

362
00:14:10.576 --> 00:14:11.739
And I said "Well how?"

363
00:14:11.739 --> 00:14:14.032
And she started telling me her problems in life.

364
00:14:14.032 --> 00:14:17.146
And she said "I was guided that you could assist me."

365
00:14:17.146 --> 00:14:19.024
So I listened to her, and I would guide her,

366
00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:20.048
and I would pray for her.

367
00:14:20.048 --> 00:14:22.373
And she would call me from time to time

368
00:14:22.373 --> 00:14:24.906
and she would send little checks in the mail to me

369
00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:29.182
thanking me for the assistance.

370
00:14:29.182 --> 00:14:30.574
<v Voiceover>Spiritual guidance.</v>

371
00:14:30.574 --> 00:14:31.224
<v ->Spiritual guidance.</v>

372
00:14:31.224 --> 00:14:33.752
And so, a number of months later,

373
00:14:33.752 --> 00:14:37.635
I'm going into a restaurant, and I see her in line.

374
00:14:37.635 --> 00:14:40.003
And I hadn't seen this woman in a long time,

375
00:14:40.003 --> 00:14:41.560
since high school.

376
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.525
And I called her name and she looked at me

377
00:14:44.525 --> 00:14:47.202
and first she was happy, then she was shocked,

378
00:14:47.202 --> 00:14:49.591
and then she ran out of the restaurant.

379
00:14:49.591 --> 00:14:52.791
Because as long as I was a voice on the phone,

380
00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:54.444
a kind of anonymous voice,

381
00:14:54.444 --> 00:14:56.897
she could share all of the stuff she was going through.

382
00:14:56.897 --> 00:14:57.719
It was okay.

383
00:14:57.719 --> 00:15:00.343
But when there was now a face to the voice,

384
00:15:00.343 --> 00:15:02.081
I think she felt embarrassed

385
00:15:02.081 --> 00:15:04.726
at some of the things that she had gone through.

386
00:15:04.726 --> 00:15:06.188
Never heard from her again.

387
00:15:06.188 --> 00:15:07.649
And then I started thinking

388
00:15:07.649 --> 00:15:09.537
I didn't even have this phone number

389
00:15:09.537 --> 00:15:10.838
when I was in high school

390
00:15:10.838 --> 00:15:12.992
and my phone number is unlisted.

391
00:15:12.992 --> 00:15:15.083
You know, so how did she get my phone number?

392
00:15:15.083 --> 00:15:18.123
She said she saw it under my annual.

393
00:15:18.123 --> 00:15:20.032
And that made me just begin to think about

394
00:15:20.032 --> 00:15:21.771
the fact that this was divinely orchestrated

395
00:15:21.771 --> 00:15:24.373
for me to begin to walk down my path

396
00:15:24.373 --> 00:15:27.018
to discover what I was to be about.

397
00:15:27.018 --> 00:15:30.936
And from there,

398
00:15:30.936 --> 00:15:33.327
my mother and another friend of mine, Lissa Sprinkles,

399
00:15:33.327 --> 00:15:35.908
took me to a metaphysical church,

400
00:15:35.908 --> 00:15:38.041
and I can remember walking into it,

401
00:15:38.041 --> 00:15:40.578
and I would never go into a church,

402
00:15:40.578 --> 00:15:42.105
and I walked into it.

403
00:15:42.105 --> 00:15:44.702
And the minister, Daniel Morgan,

404
00:15:44.702 --> 00:15:48.976
was saying "Heaven and hell are not places,

405
00:15:48.976 --> 00:15:50.352
they're states of consciousness."

406
00:15:50.352 --> 00:15:51.909
And I said "He's right!"

407
00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:53.317
<v Voiceover>(laughing) You'd been there.</v>

408
00:15:53.317 --> 00:15:54.366
<v ->"He's right!"</v>

409
00:15:54.366 --> 00:15:55.277
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

410
00:15:55.277 --> 00:15:56.161
<v ->And everyone turned around to look at me,</v>

411
00:15:56.161 --> 00:15:58.091
to see who this young whippersnapper was saying this,

412
00:15:58.091 --> 00:16:00.065
interrupting this guy's sermon.

413
00:16:00.065 --> 00:16:02.267
And I sat down,

414
00:16:02.267 --> 00:16:06.142
and I began to embark upon a studying

415
00:16:06.142 --> 00:16:09.234
to ultimately become a spiritual counselor.

416
00:16:09.234 --> 00:16:11.896
And so, what that gave me,

417
00:16:11.896 --> 00:16:14.936
was some of the language to articulate

418
00:16:14.936 --> 00:16:16.887
the visions and the experience.

419
00:16:16.887 --> 00:16:20.258
The interiority was so rich.

420
00:16:20.258 --> 00:16:22.882
And I now had language to go with that.

421
00:16:22.882 --> 00:16:24.599
You know, what I had been studying

422
00:16:24.599 --> 00:16:27.131
as well as these classes.

423
00:16:27.131 --> 00:16:30.697
So it allowed me to begin to integrate

424
00:16:30.697 --> 00:16:31.495
what I was to do.

425
00:16:31.495 --> 00:16:33.746
<v Voiceover>And so, today.</v>

426
00:16:33.746 --> 00:16:36.466
Let's fast forward almost 24 years later.

427
00:16:36.466 --> 00:16:39.111
So, ultimately, your message

428
00:16:39.111 --> 00:16:40.168
was resonating with a lot of people.

429
00:16:40.168 --> 00:16:41.168
<v ->Yes.</v>

430
00:16:41.168 --> 00:16:44.425
<v Voiceover>Agape International was born, right?</v>

431
00:16:44.425 --> 00:16:45.513
<v ->Right, 1986</v>

432
00:16:45.513 --> 00:16:47.795
<v Voiceover>1986. So this was ahead of the game a bit.</v>

433
00:16:47.795 --> 00:16:50.184
It was when, excuse me (clears throat),

434
00:16:50.184 --> 00:16:54.344
when this type of thinking was really just beginning

435
00:16:54.344 --> 00:16:57.448
to emerge in any way to the public at all

436
00:16:57.448 --> 00:17:00.018
and you were one of the way-showers of this, big time.

437
00:17:00.018 --> 00:17:01.340
This was early on.

438
00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.388
<v ->Yeah, you had Terry Cole-Whittaker out there</v>

439
00:17:03.388 --> 00:17:04.497
with her tv program,

440
00:17:04.497 --> 00:17:07.804
and you had Dr. Johnny Coleman in Chicago

441
00:17:07.804 --> 00:17:10.769
with the mega metaphysical community.

442
00:17:10.769 --> 00:17:12.582
You had certain pioneers.

443
00:17:12.582 --> 00:17:14.203
Barbara King, Dan Morgan.

444
00:17:14.203 --> 00:17:16.112
There were certain people our there.

445
00:17:16.112 --> 00:17:17.136
<v Voiceover>There were a handful out there.</v>

446
00:17:17.136 --> 00:17:17.744
<v ->Yeah.</v>

447
00:17:17.744 --> 00:17:18.928
<v Voiceover>But I remember in the time not a lot.</v>

448
00:17:18.928 --> 00:17:19.760
<v ->And there was a movement,</v>

449
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.200
but the movement was like almost undercover.

450
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.128
(Michael laughs)

451
00:17:22.128 --> 00:17:23.781
<v Voiceover>Yeah, it was very much so.</v>

452
00:17:23.781 --> 00:17:24.620
<v ->Yeah.</v>

453
00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:25.841
<v Voiceover>I remember I was a news anchor lady</v>

454
00:17:25.841 --> 00:17:27.463
at the time, trying to hide that part of my life.

455
00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:28.231
(laughs)

456
00:17:28.231 --> 00:17:30.087
<v ->Everybody was like, you had to use certain words</v>

457
00:17:30.087 --> 00:17:30.950
to see...

458
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:31.548
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

459
00:17:31.548 --> 00:17:32.945
<v ->...uh, "meditation".</v>

460
00:17:32.945 --> 00:17:34.309
<v Voiceover>So you started out what,</v>

461
00:17:34.309 --> 00:17:35.354
with a handful of people?

462
00:17:35.354 --> 00:17:36.506
<v ->I started in my living room actually.</v>

463
00:17:36.506 --> 00:17:37.416
<v Voiceover>In your living room, okay.</v>

464
00:17:37.416 --> 00:17:37.891
<v ->Yes.</v>

465
00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:38.793
<v Voiceover>And today?</v>

466
00:17:38.793 --> 00:17:40.276
<v ->Today there're thousands.</v>

467
00:17:40.276 --> 00:17:43.231
On any given Sunday we do three services.

468
00:17:43.231 --> 00:17:45.129
There would be five, six thousand people

469
00:17:45.129 --> 00:17:48.105
on a Sunday, then another thousand and a half

470
00:17:48.105 --> 00:17:51.838
on Wednesday night, plus classes during the week.

471
00:17:51.838 --> 00:17:52.681
<v Voiceover>And live.</v>

472
00:17:52.681 --> 00:17:54.654
And you're audio streaming live, aren't you?

473
00:17:54.654 --> 00:17:56.254
<v ->Plus the audio streaming around the world,</v>

474
00:17:56.254 --> 00:17:58.942
plus online class around the world,

475
00:17:58.942 --> 00:18:01.363
plus people subscribing...

476
00:18:01.363 --> 00:18:02.013
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

477
00:18:02.013 --> 00:18:04.485
<v ->...to the tapes and CDs from around the world.</v>

478
00:18:04.485 --> 00:18:05.352
<v Voiceover>And now the PBS special.</v>

479
00:18:05.352 --> 00:18:06.162
<v ->PBS special.</v>

480
00:18:06.162 --> 00:18:07.165
<v Voiceover>That's no mean feat.</v>

481
00:18:07.165 --> 00:18:08.468
<v ->No, millions of people there.</v>

482
00:18:08.468 --> 00:18:09.062
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

483
00:18:09.062 --> 00:18:11.019
<v ->And people coming for our conference every year</v>

484
00:18:11.019 --> 00:18:13.451
and meditation retreats that I do.

485
00:18:13.451 --> 00:18:15.083
<v Voiceover>That means you learned</v>

486
00:18:15.083 --> 00:18:16.417
how to articulate this stuff really, really well.

487
00:18:16.417 --> 00:18:17.910
<v ->Yeah yeah, the articulation.</v>

488
00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:19.176
<v Voiceover>So let's go and do</v>

489
00:18:19.176 --> 00:18:20.403
some of the fundamentals now.

490
00:18:20.403 --> 00:18:21.907
We're looking at, we have to ask

491
00:18:21.907 --> 00:18:22.952
a different kind of question

492
00:18:22.952 --> 00:18:26.301
to begin, as I spoke about when I asked you that

493
00:18:26.301 --> 00:18:28.102
last questions, about you,

494
00:18:28.102 --> 00:18:33.033
starting to move beyond our, each one of us,

495
00:18:33.033 --> 00:18:35.309
teensy world views of what is possible.

496
00:18:35.309 --> 00:18:37.464
How do you begin working with the person?

497
00:18:37.464 --> 00:18:40.050
Especially a person who didn't have your experience,

498
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.900
who's still in fear, but they're showing up

499
00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.575
because they're being guided to.

500
00:18:43.575 --> 00:18:45.154
<v ->Well, it would depend.</v>

501
00:18:45.154 --> 00:18:46.988
I would know, being with the individual.

502
00:18:46.988 --> 00:18:50.519
But the basics would be to begin to ask

503
00:18:50.519 --> 00:18:51.980
empowering questions.

504
00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.166
Most people ask disempowering questions.

505
00:18:54.166 --> 00:18:56.577
They ask "Why me, why is this happening,

506
00:18:56.577 --> 00:18:58.620
who's to blame, what's wrong?"

507
00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.617
And the universe will answer any question you ask.

508
00:19:01.617 --> 00:19:04.358
So if you ask who's to blame, what's wrong, why me,

509
00:19:04.358 --> 00:19:06.540
you'll get a plethora

510
00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:11.502
of unevolved,

511
00:19:11.502 --> 00:19:13.328
disjointed,

512
00:19:13.328 --> 00:19:16.180
unhealed areas of your own life

513
00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.631
that would become reflected back to you.

514
00:19:18.631 --> 00:19:20.520
But if you begin to ask questions

515
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:24.000
like "What's trying to emerge in my life, who am I,

516
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
why am I here, what gift needs to emerge

517
00:19:29.088 --> 00:19:32.938
that would heal the problem that I'm in right now?"

518
00:19:32.938 --> 00:19:34.869
If you begin to ask those kind of questions

519
00:19:34.869 --> 00:19:37.609
you'll start to get insights and revelations

520
00:19:37.609 --> 00:19:39.721
and inner guidance, inner feeling

521
00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:41.594
as to what you next step is.

522
00:19:41.594 --> 00:19:44.752
So it's to shift a person from being a victim

523
00:19:44.752 --> 00:19:48.005
of circumstance and their past and their history,

524
00:19:48.005 --> 00:19:51.141
to stepping into taking responsibility for their life

525
00:19:51.141 --> 00:19:56.000
and asking what gifts are trying to be activated to express.

526
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.225
So I teach people that you go through four stages

527
00:19:59.225 --> 00:20:00.271
of spiritual growth.

528
00:20:00.271 --> 00:20:01.657
You go through the victim stage,

529
00:20:01.657 --> 00:20:03.769
which is where a lot of the unconscious people live.

530
00:20:03.769 --> 00:20:06.702
Something outside is determining their experience.

531
00:20:06.702 --> 00:20:08.957
And then you move into the manifestor stage,

532
00:20:08.957 --> 00:20:11.775
where you take responsibility for your life,

533
00:20:11.775 --> 00:20:14.184
you learn the nature of thought and thinking.

534
00:20:14.184 --> 00:20:17.181
You learn that you're connected with this vast presence

535
00:20:17.181 --> 00:20:18.919
by whatever name you wanna call it,

536
00:20:18.919 --> 00:20:20.711
that it's friendly, it's for you,

537
00:20:20.711 --> 00:20:23.606
it doesn't compromise nor contradict its own nature.

538
00:20:23.606 --> 00:20:25.463
You seek to become consciously one with it

539
00:20:25.463 --> 00:20:27.602
through the practice of affirmative prayer,

540
00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:31.382
meditation, contemplation,

541
00:20:31.382 --> 00:20:33.488
affirmation, study,

542
00:20:33.488 --> 00:20:35.723
right kind of fellowship, finding some area

543
00:20:35.723 --> 00:20:36.971
of service in your life.

544
00:20:36.971 --> 00:20:40.715
You do all of this, in which you make yourself

545
00:20:40.715 --> 00:20:43.191
a candidate for rich insights.

546
00:20:43.191 --> 00:20:43.905
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

547
00:20:43.905 --> 00:20:47.453
<v ->And once that becomes subjectified within you</v>

548
00:20:47.453 --> 00:20:49.821
then the third stage is you realize

549
00:20:49.821 --> 00:20:51.975
you're not a person, you're a place.

550
00:20:51.975 --> 00:20:55.900
That this vast life wants to come through you.

551
00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.503
In the first stage you think something's

552
00:20:58.503 --> 00:20:59.964
doing something to you.

553
00:20:59.964 --> 00:21:03.175
The second stage you're using it, you're using the laws.

554
00:21:03.175 --> 00:21:07.121
The third stage is operating through you.

555
00:21:07.121 --> 00:21:09.254
And here you find yourself privilege

556
00:21:09.254 --> 00:21:11.165
to being in the zone sometimes.

557
00:21:11.165 --> 00:21:11.933
You're not even thinking

558
00:21:11.933 --> 00:21:13.928
but something is operating through you

559
00:21:13.928 --> 00:21:16.296
in ways beyond your wildest imaginings.

560
00:21:16.296 --> 00:21:18.578
And the fourth stage, you realize you're it.

561
00:21:18.578 --> 00:21:19.389
<v Voiceover>The embodiment.</v>

562
00:21:19.389 --> 00:21:20.295
<v ->Total embodiment.</v>

563
00:21:20.295 --> 00:21:21.031
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

564
00:21:21.031 --> 00:21:22.962
<v ->My life is the same life.</v>

565
00:21:22.962 --> 00:21:24.594
It's the only life that there is.

566
00:21:24.594 --> 00:21:27.975
Call it love, call it God, call it the evolutionary impulse.

567
00:21:27.975 --> 00:21:29.490
Call it what you will.

568
00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.959
And so I'll guide people through those four stages.

569
00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:35.874
So in stage two, you're actually giving them tools.

570
00:21:35.874 --> 00:21:37.484
The basic metaphysical tools

571
00:21:37.484 --> 00:21:39.180
in which they begin to understand

572
00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.663
that the universe is lawful.

573
00:21:40.663 --> 00:21:43.191
It's not capricious, it's not happenstance,

574
00:21:43.191 --> 00:21:44.097
it's not accidental.

575
00:21:44.097 --> 00:21:45.356
Nor are we.

576
00:21:45.356 --> 00:21:48.812
And then as you get that more and more

577
00:21:48.812 --> 00:21:50.092
you're able to surrender.

578
00:21:50.092 --> 00:21:51.254
You're able to let go of control

579
00:21:51.254 --> 00:21:54.753
because we're depending upon an order, or we're surrendering

580
00:21:54.753 --> 00:21:57.189
to an order we all depend on.

581
00:21:57.189 --> 00:22:01.050
It's like, you don't make the law of aerodynamics work,

582
00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:02.949
you surrender to it and you fly.

583
00:22:02.949 --> 00:22:07.109
You don't force yourself onto the law of buoyancy.

584
00:22:07.109 --> 00:22:08.332
You surrender to the law of buoyancy

585
00:22:08.332 --> 00:22:09.751
and it floats your boat.

586
00:22:09.751 --> 00:22:11.586
So you see in that same way

587
00:22:11.586 --> 00:22:13.004
there's an order that we depend on.

588
00:22:13.004 --> 00:22:14.348
<v Voiceover>But there has to be a maturity</v>

589
00:22:14.348 --> 00:22:16.460
in the person to even embark upon the journey

590
00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.230
to be willing to be surprised.

591
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.694
<v ->Absolutely, and that's why the universe</v>

592
00:22:20.694 --> 00:22:22.518
has something really powerful for us

593
00:22:22.518 --> 00:22:24.470
and it's called pain. (laughs)

594
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.475
<v Voiceover>Yeah, that's our wakeup call.</v>

595
00:22:26.475 --> 00:22:29.515
<v ->Yeah pushes until the vision pulls.</v>

596
00:22:29.515 --> 00:22:30.368
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

597
00:22:30.368 --> 00:22:31.019
<v ->So...</v>

598
00:22:31.019 --> 00:22:33.248
<v Voiceover>Well, going from there,</v>

599
00:22:33.248 --> 00:22:36.597
your publication, Spiritual Liberation.

600
00:22:36.597 --> 00:22:38.794
What you're talking about right now

601
00:22:38.794 --> 00:22:40.128
are these kind of the tenants

602
00:22:40.128 --> 00:22:42.352
of what you work with within that?

603
00:22:42.352 --> 00:22:45.504
<v ->Well, Spiritual Liberation is 18 chapters</v>

604
00:22:45.504 --> 00:22:49.931
of how to embrace this evolutionary impulse

605
00:22:49.931 --> 00:22:52.432
and it's for beginners and veterans.

606
00:22:52.432 --> 00:22:53.584
There's enough there...

607
00:22:53.584 --> 00:22:54.427
<v Voiceover>Mhmm</v>

608
00:22:54.427 --> 00:22:56.386
<v ->...that if somebody's been studying for years</v>

609
00:22:56.386 --> 00:22:59.874
they will feel and hear and catch the subtleties

610
00:22:59.874 --> 00:23:01.122
that you'll be able to catch

611
00:23:01.122 --> 00:23:02.574
if you've had a level of practice.

612
00:23:02.574 --> 00:23:03.315
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

613
00:23:03.315 --> 00:23:04.785
<v ->Now if you haven't had a level of practice,</v>

614
00:23:04.785 --> 00:23:06.876
the basics are right there for everybody

615
00:23:06.876 --> 00:23:08.822
to begin to practice.

616
00:23:08.822 --> 00:23:10.442
And some things you won't notice

617
00:23:10.442 --> 00:23:12.319
because you haven't been practicing long enough

618
00:23:12.319 --> 00:23:14.188
to even know what sentence even means

619
00:23:14.188 --> 00:23:17.559
or why it's relevant.

620
00:23:17.559 --> 00:23:20.950
But for a person who's been sitting in meditation

621
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.852
for 10, 15, 20 years they'll understand exactly

622
00:23:23.852 --> 00:23:26.379
that that's the next stage of evolution.

623
00:23:26.379 --> 00:23:29.121
So the book is for all, all people.

624
00:23:29.121 --> 00:23:33.972
And it carries practices and embodiments as well.

625
00:23:33.972 --> 00:23:35.243
[Voiceover] So for you,

626
00:23:35.243 --> 00:23:37.686
how big can it be?

627
00:23:37.686 --> 00:23:39.264
How big can life be?

628
00:23:39.264 --> 00:23:43.211
How big can the dream that we dream for ourselves be?

629
00:23:43.211 --> 00:23:44.512
<v ->The bigger the better.</v>

630
00:23:44.512 --> 00:23:45.781
<v Voiceover>(laughing) Yeah.</v>

631
00:23:45.781 --> 00:23:47.477
I mean, you've really dreamed yourself

632
00:23:47.477 --> 00:23:49.845
into an incredibly large presence.

633
00:23:49.845 --> 00:23:53.874
<v ->Yeah, and it's all about service.</v>

634
00:23:53.874 --> 00:23:55.115
I really believe.

635
00:23:55.115 --> 00:23:57.227
I can remember than when I was a kid, though.

636
00:23:57.227 --> 00:23:59.787
You see, I was 11, 12 years old, I would sit

637
00:23:59.787 --> 00:24:02.336
and lay on my back looking up at the sky

638
00:24:02.336 --> 00:24:03.541
and this beautiful tree

639
00:24:03.541 --> 00:24:05.098
in my father's front yard.

640
00:24:05.098 --> 00:24:09.354
And I can remember I wanted to make a difference

641
00:24:09.354 --> 00:24:13.361
in the transformation of the planet.

642
00:24:13.361 --> 00:24:16.754
And so, that's what I think about all the time.

643
00:24:16.754 --> 00:24:19.218
Making a difference on the planet

644
00:24:19.218 --> 00:24:21.543
before I leave it, you know.

645
00:24:21.543 --> 00:24:23.858
And so, because of that,

646
00:24:23.858 --> 00:24:26.599
I'm put into positions where I meet beautiful people,

647
00:24:26.599 --> 00:24:29.809
wonderful people, that have a similar dream,

648
00:24:29.809 --> 00:24:31.889
a similar focus, similar vision.

649
00:24:31.889 --> 00:24:34.118
And then there's evolutionary alliances

650
00:24:34.118 --> 00:24:36.017
that are formed

651
00:24:36.017 --> 00:24:40.983
and power is garnered and amplified.

652
00:24:40.983 --> 00:24:42.243
<v Voiceover>So this is the real key.</v>

653
00:24:42.243 --> 00:24:44.526
One of the keys of what you said earlier,

654
00:24:44.526 --> 00:24:45.496
you're teaching people,

655
00:24:45.496 --> 00:24:48.141
is we have to be able to hear the answer

656
00:24:48.141 --> 00:24:50.168
to the question "Why am I here?"

657
00:24:50.168 --> 00:24:50.744
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

658
00:24:50.744 --> 00:24:51.555
<v Voiceover>What is my purpose?</v>

659
00:24:51.555 --> 00:24:54.914
Without the answers to those simple questions,

660
00:24:54.914 --> 00:24:58.377
but profound questions, you really can't magnetize to you

661
00:24:58.377 --> 00:25:01.321
what you need to accomplish what you were born into.

662
00:25:01.321 --> 00:25:01.971
<v ->No.</v>

663
00:25:01.971 --> 00:25:02.835
<v Voiceover>What you were born to do.</v>

664
00:25:02.835 --> 00:25:04.990
<v ->Most people are living at this victim stage</v>

665
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:07.198
where they are subject to malicious hypnotism.

666
00:25:07.198 --> 00:25:09.491
And that's the hypnotism of the world.

667
00:25:09.491 --> 00:25:11.283
And they think they're to come here,

668
00:25:11.283 --> 00:25:13.416
get a lot of money or be entertained

669
00:25:13.416 --> 00:25:16.787
or whatever, and be anti-bored until they die,

670
00:25:16.787 --> 00:25:19.336
and there's nothing there in between,

671
00:25:19.336 --> 00:25:21.032
there's no real reason for them to be alive.

672
00:25:21.032 --> 00:25:24.273
And so if they're born in America,

673
00:25:24.273 --> 00:25:29.255
high tech, low touch society, materialism, consumerism,

674
00:25:29.255 --> 00:25:30.628
they think they're here to shop.

675
00:25:30.628 --> 00:25:33.412
And people really think that's why they're existing.

676
00:25:33.412 --> 00:25:35.246
<v Voiceover>(laughing) I've said that many times too.</v>

677
00:25:35.246 --> 00:25:36.889
<v ->You know, shop or be entertained.</v>

678
00:25:36.889 --> 00:25:37.540
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

679
00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:38.865
<v ->One of the two things, they don't realize it.</v>

680
00:25:38.865 --> 00:25:40.625
<v Voiceover>Totally passive endeavors, in a sense.</v>

681
00:25:40.625 --> 00:25:41.980
<v ->Yeah, like "I'm here to be entertained."</v>

682
00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.981
And so they don't realize that they're here

683
00:25:43.981 --> 00:25:46.804
to be creators, they're here to manifest creativity

684
00:25:46.804 --> 00:25:49.881
and resourcefulness, and activate the genius

685
00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:51.790
at a very profound level.

686
00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:54.275
And so they're just guided along

687
00:25:54.275 --> 00:25:57.102
until some kind of existential crisis occurs

688
00:25:57.102 --> 00:25:59.267
and then they begin to ask these kind of questions.

689
00:25:59.267 --> 00:26:01.259
Why am I here, what my real purpose is.

690
00:26:01.259 --> 00:26:03.403
Because you're not gonna get it from the college system

691
00:26:03.403 --> 00:26:04.555
because that's preparing you for a job

692
00:26:04.555 --> 00:26:06.048
to fit into society.

693
00:26:06.048 --> 00:26:09.418
You're not gonna get it, your religious,

694
00:26:09.418 --> 00:26:11.035
because they're preparing you for the afterlife.

695
00:26:11.035 --> 00:26:13.104
If you're good you might go to heaven, you know,

696
00:26:13.104 --> 00:26:15.515
and so everybody's keeping you away from you.

697
00:26:15.515 --> 00:26:18.416
You know, there's nothing bringing you to you.

698
00:26:18.416 --> 00:26:22.223
So yeah, people, we need to wake up.

699
00:26:22.223 --> 00:26:23.621
<v Voiceover>We do, and when you were talking</v>

700
00:26:23.621 --> 00:26:27.215
about our being driven by just consuming,

701
00:26:27.215 --> 00:26:29.775
what was flashing through my mind in that moment

702
00:26:29.775 --> 00:26:33.817
was a scene in the animated film WALL-E,

703
00:26:33.817 --> 00:26:34.692
I don't know if you saw that.

704
00:26:34.692 --> 00:26:35.343
<v ->Yes, yes, yes, yes.</v>

705
00:26:35.343 --> 00:26:36.527
<v Voiceover>With all those little babies</v>

706
00:26:36.527 --> 00:26:39.502
watching commercials, chubbing up by the moment,

707
00:26:39.502 --> 00:26:41.380
sucking on their big smoothies.

708
00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:42.222
<v ->Right, right, right.</v>

709
00:26:42.222 --> 00:26:43.374
<v Voiceover>Soft drinks from birth.</v>

710
00:26:43.374 --> 00:26:45.859
And that's kind of what we've got, isn't it?

711
00:26:45.859 --> 00:26:46.862
<v ->That was a wakeup call.</v>

712
00:26:46.862 --> 00:26:47.832
<v Voiceover>That was a wakeup call.</v>

713
00:26:47.832 --> 00:26:48.952
That was brilliantly done.

714
00:26:48.952 --> 00:26:49.784
<v ->Brilliantly done.</v>

715
00:26:49.784 --> 00:26:51.896
It wasn't preaching, it was just reflection.

716
00:26:51.896 --> 00:26:55.224
<v Voiceover>So, we're obviously going to suggest</v>

717
00:26:55.224 --> 00:26:56.493
that anybody who wants to connect,

718
00:26:56.493 --> 00:26:59.682
you almost get a contact high being with you

719
00:26:59.682 --> 00:27:01.677
because you really do embody

720
00:27:01.677 --> 00:27:03.927
what you have experienced throughout your life.

721
00:27:03.927 --> 00:27:05.645
And this love really comes pouring off of you,

722
00:27:05.645 --> 00:27:10.135
so as a spiritual leader in this world,

723
00:27:10.135 --> 00:27:12.367
people can have a taste of you any time

724
00:27:12.367 --> 00:27:15.131
just by coming to Agave Live, for one.

725
00:27:15.131 --> 00:27:15.903
<v ->Agape!</v>

726
00:27:15.903 --> 00:27:19.010
<v Voiceover>Excuse me, I just want my agave.</v>

727
00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:20.846
(laughing) Agave Live, that was a slip!

728
00:27:20.846 --> 00:27:22.063
<v ->It's sweet like agave.</v>

729
00:27:22.063 --> 00:27:22.847
(interviewer laughing)

730
00:27:22.847 --> 00:27:25.517
<v ->We used to sell Agape agave (laughing).</v>

731
00:27:25.517 --> 00:27:28.024
<v Voiceover>Okay, sorry about that one, little slip.</v>

732
00:27:28.024 --> 00:27:30.232
But I think everybody knows the intention.

733
00:27:30.232 --> 00:27:32.130
But let's before we wrap it up,

734
00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:34.274
let's get to Citizen Global and what that's all about.

735
00:27:34.274 --> 00:27:35.543
<v ->Oh, absolutely.</v>

736
00:27:35.543 --> 00:27:38.263
Well individuals can actually be their own media.

737
00:27:38.263 --> 00:27:40.791
They can go to Citizen Global.

738
00:27:40.791 --> 00:27:44.322
I think it's Citizen Global, black slash, hyphen, Agape.

739
00:27:44.322 --> 00:27:45.783
And we have our on studio there

740
00:27:45.783 --> 00:27:49.091
and there's a number of people who have studios there.

741
00:27:49.091 --> 00:27:53.376
You can actually go there and put your own film,

742
00:27:53.376 --> 00:27:56.096
your own information, you can answer

743
00:27:56.096 --> 00:27:57.973
some of the questions we have there

744
00:27:57.973 --> 00:27:59.339
about the answer is you.

745
00:27:59.339 --> 00:28:01.333
It's very powerful, so people are logging in

746
00:28:01.333 --> 00:28:04.288
around the world now and creating this powerful community

747
00:28:04.288 --> 00:28:07.797
where people are speaking their own truth

748
00:28:07.797 --> 00:28:10.221
and realizing that they can be their own media.

749
00:28:10.221 --> 00:28:11.368
<v Voiceover>That's fabulous.</v>

750
00:28:11.368 --> 00:28:12.595
<v ->Yeah, so they could...</v>

751
00:28:12.595 --> 00:28:14.336
<v Voiceover>We have to feel we're part of.</v>

752
00:28:14.336 --> 00:28:15.582
<v ->Absolutely. And we are.</v>

753
00:28:15.582 --> 00:28:16.639
<v Voiceover>And this is really the drive now,</v>

754
00:28:16.639 --> 00:28:18.198
this is what the Internet is allowing.

755
00:28:18.198 --> 00:28:21.697
<v ->The Internet and this type of technology</v>

756
00:28:21.697 --> 00:28:24.832
is really the birth of the second coming, you see,

757
00:28:24.832 --> 00:28:28.583
of this collective consciousness of oneness.

758
00:28:28.583 --> 00:28:30.044
Not coming through one person

759
00:28:30.044 --> 00:28:33.713
but coming through a collective, a group of individuals

760
00:28:33.713 --> 00:28:37.126
who are catching a vision and who are articulating it

761
00:28:37.126 --> 00:28:38.086
and acting on it.

762
00:28:38.086 --> 00:28:40.219
So Citizen Global, they can access

763
00:28:40.219 --> 00:28:41.958
right through Agape Live dot com.

764
00:28:41.958 --> 00:28:43.024
They can go right there.

765
00:28:43.024 --> 00:28:43.696
<v Voiceover>Wonderful.</v>

766
00:28:43.696 --> 00:28:45.467
<v ->They can go right there for the PBS special,</v>

767
00:28:45.467 --> 00:28:48.741
they can go right there for my online community,

768
00:28:48.741 --> 00:28:52.016
to join that, or to watch me live

769
00:28:52.016 --> 00:28:54.130
on Sundays or Wednesdays as well.

770
00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:57.254
<v Voiceover>So, my final question simply,</v>

771
00:28:57.254 --> 00:28:58.949
a lot of people are in fear right now.

772
00:28:58.949 --> 00:29:01.394
They appear to be losing a great deal in their lives.

773
00:29:01.394 --> 00:29:02.428
<v ->Yes.</v>

774
00:29:02.428 --> 00:29:05.532
<v Voiceover>And so, coming into contact with you</v>

775
00:29:05.532 --> 00:29:08.924
and your works really is almost an intervention

776
00:29:08.924 --> 00:29:12.124
of sorts at a very painful and critical time.

777
00:29:12.124 --> 00:29:14.214
But it's more, rather than individual,

778
00:29:14.214 --> 00:29:15.773
we're kind of going through a collective pain right now.

779
00:29:15.773 --> 00:29:16.571
<v ->Right.</v>

780
00:29:16.571 --> 00:29:18.983
<v Voiceover>Any final comments to that?</v>

781
00:29:18.983 --> 00:29:21.083
<v ->I would say, as there's so many final comments,</v>

782
00:29:21.083 --> 00:29:25.945
one, fear, can be debilitating.

783
00:29:25.945 --> 00:29:28.648
And so I teach people just to take your fear with you.

784
00:29:28.648 --> 00:29:30.248
Most people will hesitate

785
00:29:30.248 --> 00:29:32.776
and say "You know, I'm gonna do such and such

786
00:29:32.776 --> 00:29:34.376
when I get over my fear."

787
00:29:34.376 --> 00:29:36.168
Well you're never gonna get over your fear

788
00:29:36.168 --> 00:29:37.565
because you have a body

789
00:29:37.565 --> 00:29:38.472
and as long as you have a body

790
00:29:38.472 --> 00:29:39.496
you have an ego.

791
00:29:39.496 --> 00:29:41.981
And the ego wants to keep you in your present paradigm

792
00:29:41.981 --> 00:29:43.815
so it's always going to project the fear

793
00:29:43.815 --> 00:29:45.415
of worst case scenarios.

794
00:29:45.415 --> 00:29:47.774
So I teach people, take your fear with you.

795
00:29:47.774 --> 00:29:48.774
<v Voiceover>Good.</v>

796
00:29:48.774 --> 00:29:52.165
<v ->Become aware of what your next step is,</v>

797
00:29:52.165 --> 00:29:53.943
and then take the fear with you.

798
00:29:53.943 --> 00:29:55.895
The fear will become transmuted

799
00:29:55.895 --> 00:29:57.686
into excitement and then enthusiasm.

800
00:29:57.686 --> 00:29:59.521
<v Voiceover>How practical, how real.</v>

801
00:29:59.521 --> 00:30:00.982
<v ->But don't wait until you get rid of it.</v>

802
00:30:00.982 --> 00:30:01.679
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

803
00:30:01.679 --> 00:30:03.369
<v ->Because you never are going to get rid of it.</v>

804
00:30:03.369 --> 00:30:04.833
<v Voiceover>Well you said there're a bunch of points.</v>

805
00:30:04.833 --> 00:30:05.990
Do you wanna give us one more?

806
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:07.965
Otherwise, we could talk for days,

807
00:30:07.965 --> 00:30:10.216
so we'll let people kinda find you after that.

808
00:30:10.216 --> 00:30:12.050
One more that you feel is as relevant

809
00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:13.439
as take your fear with you?

810
00:30:13.439 --> 00:30:15.476
<v ->Well I think that there are a lot of people</v>

811
00:30:15.476 --> 00:30:17.963
out here who want to save the planet,

812
00:30:17.963 --> 00:30:18.848
save the world.

813
00:30:18.848 --> 00:30:20.288
And I would share with them

814
00:30:20.288 --> 00:30:21.653
you don't want to save the world,

815
00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:23.627
you want to serve the emerging paradigm.

816
00:30:23.627 --> 00:30:25.674
The world that's out here right now,

817
00:30:25.674 --> 00:30:26.997
we don't really wanna save the world

818
00:30:26.997 --> 00:30:30.731
that has fear, bigotry, selfishness, greed.

819
00:30:30.731 --> 00:30:33.355
We wanna let that world dissolve.

820
00:30:33.355 --> 00:30:35.530
We wanna serve that which is tyring to emerge

821
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:37.482
and that's where visioning comes in

822
00:30:37.482 --> 00:30:38.762
in asking the right questions.

823
00:30:38.762 --> 00:30:40.991
So we can begin to see it, articulate it,

824
00:30:40.991 --> 00:30:43.254
and then act from it.

825
00:30:43.254 --> 00:30:44.218
<v Voiceover>Beautifully put.</v>

826
00:30:44.218 --> 00:30:45.444
Michael, thank you so much
