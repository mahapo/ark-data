00:00:12.798 --> 00:00:15.802
<v ->One question that has left archaeologists and historians</v>

3
00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:18.570
alike confused is the evidence that the further

4
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.338
we go back into our human history,

5
00:00:20.338 --> 00:00:22.841
the more advanced some of the cultures seem to be.

6
00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:25.644
This led author Lucy Wyatt into an exploration of

7
00:00:25.644 --> 00:00:28.546
these cycles in which the rise and fall of empires

8
00:00:28.546 --> 00:00:31.582
drives our evolution and devolution.

9
00:00:31.582 --> 00:00:33.685
In her book "Approaching Chaos" she also

10
00:00:33.685 --> 00:00:36.288
speaks of the Roman Empire as the fall of

11
00:00:36.288 --> 00:00:39.473
humankind's spiritual consciousness.

(up-tempo drumbeat)

13
00:00:52.504 --> 00:00:54.907
Lucy, you've written this very well-researched book

14
00:00:54.907 --> 00:00:58.876
called "Approaching Chaos" and it seems the starting point

15
00:00:58.876 --> 00:01:02.614
seems very important here which is there have been high

16
00:01:02.614 --> 00:01:05.717
civilizations in the past that seem to have disappeared.

17
00:01:05.717 --> 00:01:08.353
And this is very important for us to know about at

18
00:01:08.353 --> 00:01:11.756
this point, which is a large turning point for civilization.

19
00:01:11.756 --> 00:01:14.426
Let's start with the notion that,

20
00:01:14.426 --> 00:01:19.426
what your research is indicating is that cities really

21
00:01:19.464 --> 00:01:23.269
were the preferred structure of the day in ancient

22
00:01:23.269 --> 00:01:25.736
times where advanced cultures existed.

23
00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:27.640
It wasn't farming moving into the city

24
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.573
but the city moving outward.

25
00:01:29.573 --> 00:01:32.110
Now let's just choose that as a starting point.

26
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.613
<v ->Sure yeah, that's a really good starting point because we,</v>

27
00:01:35.613 --> 00:01:38.015
as far as I can tell, we've been telling ourselves

28
00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:40.552
the wrong story since the end of the Ice Age.

29
00:01:40.552 --> 00:01:43.656
We've been telling ourselves a story that farming

30
00:01:43.656 --> 00:01:46.323
is an experiment, that Neolithic man was throwing

31
00:01:46.323 --> 00:01:49.293
a few seeds around and that cities grew from

32
00:01:49.293 --> 00:01:52.764
exchange of surplus, agricultural surplus.

33
00:01:52.764 --> 00:01:55.199
And when you really look at the archaeological record

34
00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:58.869
that's not what it shows, it really isn't.

35
00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.239
And I mean I could go into more detail but perhaps

36
00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:03.109
we haven't quite got enough time for that.

37
00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:06.144
But the point is that as far as I can see,

38
00:02:06.144 --> 00:02:09.747
the more rational explanation is that agriculture as we

39
00:02:09.747 --> 00:02:13.819
know it came out of cities and not the other way around.

40
00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.888
And that what we have to understand is that cities arrived

41
00:02:16.888 --> 00:02:21.160
pre-planned, they weren't organic marketplaces that grew.

42
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.595
For example a very well-respected person who

43
00:02:23.595 --> 00:02:26.231
wrote about this a bit called Jaketa Haux,

44
00:02:26.231 --> 00:02:28.133
she makes the point that the first people

45
00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:31.236
in cities were priests, not farmers.

46
00:02:31.236 --> 00:02:32.871
So she knew that something,

47
00:02:32.871 --> 00:02:34.707
I mean she didn't understand why,

48
00:02:34.707 --> 00:02:36.875
she couldn't see what the whole point of it was but she

49
00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:40.245
knew that there was something different going on there.

50
00:02:40.245 --> 00:02:43.982
And really that, going back to those origins should alert

51
00:02:43.982 --> 00:02:47.353
us to something that was going on that doesn't make any

52
00:02:47.353 --> 00:02:50.155
sense to us and we should ask ourselves the question,

53
00:02:50.155 --> 00:02:52.391
"Why did this happen the way it did?"

54
00:02:52.391 --> 00:02:54.527
And really go back to the beginning

55
00:02:54.527 --> 00:02:57.129
and think about it quite differently.

56
00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.097
That's really why I've written the book, to explore that.

57
00:03:00.097 --> 00:03:02.167
<v Regina>It does seem backward because</v>

58
00:03:02.167 --> 00:03:04.001
what you're talking about in this book,

59
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:06.738
and you're using many different points as evidence.

60
00:03:06.738 --> 00:03:10.809
And one of them is from archaeological remnants

61
00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:13.713
of pottery shards and such that actually some of the more

62
00:03:13.713 --> 00:03:16.949
beautiful and sophisticated work is the further back you go,

63
00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:18.683
it's not in recent times.

64
00:03:18.683 --> 00:03:21.051
We seem to have somehow devolved

65
00:03:21.051 --> 00:03:23.388
in our understandings, in our culture.

66
00:03:23.388 --> 00:03:26.658
Our cultures have devolved rather than evolved.

67
00:03:26.658 --> 00:03:28.859
<v ->Well we've told ourselves the story that everything</v>

68
00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.859
evolves and everything is progress and in order to justify

69
00:03:33.897 --> 00:03:36.634
the fact that we feel that we are the most advanced,

70
00:03:36.634 --> 00:03:38.504
we are the most progressive.

71
00:03:38.504 --> 00:03:41.907
And we've kind of told ourselves this as propaganda really.

72
00:03:41.907 --> 00:03:45.010
Which is, that way of thinking has blinkered us to

73
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.346
the fact that these people were very sophisticated.

74
00:03:48.346 --> 00:03:50.516
And if you go to the British Museum and you look at

75
00:03:50.516 --> 00:03:52.650
the Halafian pottery and so forth,

76
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.353
you can see that it is exquisite.

77
00:03:55.353 --> 00:03:57.988
And even the archaeologists talk about when pottery was

78
00:03:57.988 --> 00:04:02.988
starting to be made on a wheel, it declined in standards.

79
00:04:02.994 --> 00:04:05.697
That earlier pottery, which wasn't made on a wheel

80
00:04:05.697 --> 00:04:08.633
is much finer and more beautiful and you can see

81
00:04:08.633 --> 00:04:11.403
that these things that people were clearly taught,

82
00:04:11.403 --> 00:04:13.605
they were taught that the original things were

83
00:04:13.605 --> 00:04:16.207
much higher standard and then they declined.

84
00:04:16.207 --> 00:04:18.209
So that in itself, even if you just look at the

85
00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.947
evidence in the museums should make you go,

86
00:04:20.947 --> 00:04:23.114
"Hang on a minute, what's going on here?

87
00:04:23.114 --> 00:04:24.783
Something strange is happening."

88
00:04:24.783 --> 00:04:27.685
<v Regina>And certainly the artifacts that surrounded</v>

89
00:04:27.685 --> 00:04:31.022
the royal families of the day, I mean the pharaohs and such.

90
00:04:31.022 --> 00:04:35.127
Exquisite jewelry making, beautiful little parlor games

91
00:04:35.127 --> 00:04:37.162
that they used to play to amuse themselves

92
00:04:37.162 --> 00:04:39.297
in the afternoon and that sort of thing.

93
00:04:39.297 --> 00:04:43.367
Fine furniture making, crafts that are all but lost now.

94
00:04:43.367 --> 00:04:46.738
<v ->Absolutely, and if you go to somewhere like Saqqara</v>

95
00:04:46.738 --> 00:04:51.738
and the mud brick mastabas where the tombs are in Saqqara,

96
00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:56.809
the bas-reliefs that show the scenes of everyday life

97
00:04:58.049 --> 00:05:00.685
that take the pharaoh unto another place,

98
00:05:00.685 --> 00:05:02.987
of the donkeys and things.

99
00:05:02.987 --> 00:05:05.623
They are so beautiful, they're so three-dimensional.

100
00:05:05.623 --> 00:05:07.758
You can see the veins on the donkeys,

101
00:05:07.758 --> 00:05:10.662
and these are the things that are the oldest in Egypt.

102
00:05:10.662 --> 00:05:14.600
So it's not like things have got better over time.

103
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.069
So it's this lack of evolution that should really make us

104
00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:22.006
feel very questioning about that ancient past indeed.

105
00:05:22.006 --> 00:05:26.244
<v Regina>Yes, and we're looking at also a different view.</v>

106
00:05:26.244 --> 00:05:29.647
Let's just start with Egypt because it's recent history,

107
00:05:29.647 --> 00:05:32.735
say in the last six, 7,000 years.

108
00:05:33.417 --> 00:05:35.253
Excuse me. (coughing)

109
00:05:35.253 --> 00:05:37.371
Just starting there.

110
00:05:40.058 --> 00:05:43.628
There are several things that have popped out in your book

111
00:05:43.628 --> 00:05:47.032
that intrigued me in particular but

112
00:05:47.032 --> 00:05:50.301
the notion of the work of another female author

113
00:05:50.301 --> 00:05:52.870
we were talking about a little while ago,

114
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.073
the evidence as to what the slaves,

115
00:05:56.073 --> 00:05:58.710
those thought to have been the slaves were treated like

116
00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.145
is really very different than what we depict

117
00:06:01.145 --> 00:06:03.414
certainly in our religious texts, for example.

118
00:06:03.414 --> 00:06:04.983
It's nothing like that at all.

119
00:06:04.983 --> 00:06:07.784
Let's start with the day-to-day population in Egypt

120
00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:10.455
of those who were providing the services.

121
00:06:10.455 --> 00:06:13.157
<v ->Right, well the problem that we have for a start</v>

122
00:06:13.157 --> 00:06:15.392
is that most of what we understand about Egypt

123
00:06:15.392 --> 00:06:18.363
comes through the Greeks, and it's only if the Greeks knew

124
00:06:18.363 --> 00:06:21.432
about something that we've kinda been told about it.

125
00:06:21.432 --> 00:06:24.203
And quite often the Greeks misunderstood what was going on

126
00:06:24.203 --> 00:06:26.603
because they weren't around at the time say,

127
00:06:26.603 --> 00:06:28.740
of the building of the Great Pyramid.

128
00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.078
They didn't come to Egypt for several thousand years later.

129
00:06:33.078 --> 00:06:36.482
So if we're gonna base our view of a slave society

130
00:06:36.482 --> 00:06:38.350
on what the Greeks have told us,

131
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.318
or Herodotus or whoever it is,

132
00:06:40.318 --> 00:06:44.621
then that in itself is gonna make us make mistakes.

133
00:06:44.621 --> 00:06:46.691
We're not going to get to the right place.

134
00:06:46.691 --> 00:06:49.427
But take for example the building of the Great Pyramid,

135
00:06:49.427 --> 00:06:51.262
I think we were talking about that earlier.

136
00:06:51.262 --> 00:06:52.997
These documentaries and the evidence,

137
00:06:52.997 --> 00:06:57.997
the archaeological evidence of the builders' villages

138
00:06:58.103 --> 00:07:01.839
which clearly show that these people were very well-treated.

139
00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:03.841
That they lived in proper houses,

140
00:07:03.841 --> 00:07:06.678
that they had very high standards of food.

141
00:07:06.678 --> 00:07:09.514
For example they were allowed the best cuts of meat

142
00:07:09.514 --> 00:07:13.452
that only usually the aristocrats in Egypt had.

143
00:07:13.452 --> 00:07:16.287
Breweries, bakeries, that kind of thing.

144
00:07:16.287 --> 00:07:21.188
And also even more important, they had medical assistance.

145
00:07:22.548 --> 00:07:26.331
The way that their injuries have healed shows,

146
00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:28.732
in their skeletal remains shows that they actually

147
00:07:28.732 --> 00:07:31.769
received medical attention long before they died.

148
00:07:31.769 --> 00:07:33.305
These injuries have healed and they've been

149
00:07:33.305 --> 00:07:35.706
quite severe injuries in some cases.

150
00:07:35.706 --> 00:07:38.243
So there's no evidence that these people were treated

151
00:07:38.243 --> 00:07:43.243
cruelly at all and it's in totally our concept of a slave

152
00:07:43.482 --> 00:07:47.719
in a kind of Roman-Greek sense of cruelty

153
00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:51.022
and forced labor and that kind of thing.

154
00:07:51.022 --> 00:07:55.026
So we're putting onto the ancient Egyptians our

155
00:07:55.026 --> 00:07:58.429
own prejudices basically and there is no evidence

156
00:07:58.429 --> 00:08:02.534
that that image is true at all.

157
00:08:02.534 --> 00:08:04.903
<v Regina>And then you have to get into then,</v>

158
00:08:04.903 --> 00:08:07.338
well this gets into a lot of other information such as

159
00:08:07.338 --> 00:08:10.341
what some of the genuine technologies that were used in

160
00:08:10.341 --> 00:08:13.044
the day or employed in the day to build the pyramids were.

161
00:08:13.044 --> 00:08:14.145
<v ->Yes.</v>

162
00:08:14.145 --> 00:08:15.880
<v Regina>In which case it wouldn't have required</v>

163
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.880
that kind of manual labor that's depicted in religious

164
00:08:21.652 --> 00:08:24.488
texts for example as to, or in as you say ancient

165
00:08:24.488 --> 00:08:26.858
Roman texts as to what the Egyptians were.

166
00:08:26.858 --> 00:08:28.660
That would just be rendered inaccurate

167
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.194
and meaningless to begin with.

168
00:08:30.194 --> 00:08:31.963
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

169
00:08:31.963 --> 00:08:35.499
I mean the ancient Egyptians didn't even have wheelbarrows.

170
00:08:35.499 --> 00:08:38.169
They didn't have pulleys and things like that.

171
00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:39.939
They didn't have those technologies

172
00:08:39.939 --> 00:08:41.738
because they didn't need to.

173
00:08:41.738 --> 00:08:43.741
<v Regina>They had more sophisticated technology available</v>

174
00:08:43.741 --> 00:08:45.710
to them so, and we don't need to go down that road,

175
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.045
there are many other books written on that.

176
00:08:48.045 --> 00:08:50.848
And another thing is that again, this whole notion

177
00:08:50.848 --> 00:08:53.785
of evolution, evolution of language and so forth.

178
00:08:53.785 --> 00:08:56.421
And as you point out, the Egyptian hieroglyphics,

179
00:08:56.421 --> 00:08:58.423
which we have not yet decoded.

180
00:08:58.423 --> 00:09:00.559
There have been attempts to do some surface types

181
00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:04.061
of decoding but the real thing has not been decoded yet.

182
00:09:04.061 --> 00:09:07.499
That appears fully formed in it's most ancient,

183
00:09:07.499 --> 00:09:10.335
the most ancient remnants of it are fully formed,

184
00:09:10.335 --> 00:09:11.970
it's not a thing that evolved.

185
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.438
<v ->Absolutely, absolutely.</v>

186
00:09:13.438 --> 00:09:16.474
In the same way as the things at Saqqara don't show

187
00:09:16.474 --> 00:09:21.145
any decline, they show that the early stuff is the best.

188
00:09:21.145 --> 00:09:23.849
In the same way as you look at the earliest hieroglyphs,

189
00:09:23.849 --> 00:09:27.351
even 2,000 years later they haven't changed.

190
00:09:27.351 --> 00:09:29.653
They're still the pure thing and they are the total

191
00:09:29.653 --> 00:09:32.189
concept and they are the total language.

192
00:09:32.189 --> 00:09:36.060
There's no kind of greater additions that occur later on,

193
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.896
and so it is very hard to know where these things come from.

194
00:09:38.896 --> 00:09:41.400
That's very true and wouldn't like to hazard a guess.

195
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.268
I mean there is some thoughts that they're very

196
00:09:43.268 --> 00:09:46.304
much linked to the cuneiform of Mesopotamia,

197
00:09:46.304 --> 00:09:48.539
and there are various people who think that the

198
00:09:48.539 --> 00:09:53.011
Egyptians that arrived in Egypt at about 3,100 B.C.

199
00:09:53.011 --> 00:09:55.313
actually came from Mesopotamia.

200
00:09:55.313 --> 00:09:58.816
But they didn't start off with wet clay and a pressed

201
00:09:58.816 --> 00:10:01.518
stylus making cuneiform, that the Mesopotamians.

202
00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:06.518
They started off straight off with ink and papyrus

203
00:10:06.557 --> 00:10:08.659
and carving straight into stone.

204
00:10:08.659 --> 00:10:12.797
So already they had a different technological approach to

205
00:10:12.797 --> 00:10:16.801
their writing and there is no evolution in it, as you say.

206
00:10:16.801 --> 00:10:18.536
So yes, another thing.

207
00:10:18.536 --> 00:10:20.906
<v Regina>And I think it's important to focus on Egypt</v>

208
00:10:20.906 --> 00:10:23.473
here because what we've been taught in the West

209
00:10:23.473 --> 00:10:26.611
we think has originated in Greco-Roman times.

210
00:10:26.611 --> 00:10:27.880
<v ->Yes.</v>

211
00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.183
<v Regina>And architecture, mathematics and so forth</v>

212
00:10:30.183 --> 00:10:32.716
when this was all Egyptian knowledge that had been passed

213
00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:35.754
on and maybe give a couple examples of some of the key

214
00:10:35.754 --> 00:10:39.223
players in Greece who had actually learned in Egypt.

215
00:10:39.223 --> 00:10:42.727
<v ->Well Pythagoras, he's the most important one and he</v>

216
00:10:42.727 --> 00:10:47.165
actually claims to have spent 25 years in Egyptian temples.

217
00:10:47.165 --> 00:10:50.067
I mean it's only because we kind of think everything

218
00:10:50.067 --> 00:10:54.639
starts with the Greeks, and how ridiculous is that?

219
00:10:54.639 --> 00:10:58.144
You know at about 600, 500 B.C. or whenever it is,

220
00:10:58.144 --> 00:11:00.078
suddenly the Greeks know everything.

221
00:11:00.078 --> 00:11:03.281
Well there's no evidence that they evolved that information,

222
00:11:03.281 --> 00:11:05.683
and highly sophisticated information.

223
00:11:05.683 --> 00:11:09.219
I mean I think one of the major problems is that the people

224
00:11:09.219 --> 00:11:12.657
who have looked at Egypt in the past have mostly been,

225
00:11:12.657 --> 00:11:14.458
without wishing to sound rude,

226
00:11:14.458 --> 00:11:16.760
have mostly been a branch of artistry.

227
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.131
They've not been technicians, they've not been engineers,

228
00:11:20.131 --> 00:11:22.632
they have not necessarily been mathematicians

229
00:11:22.632 --> 00:11:24.402
or whoever it is.

230
00:11:24.402 --> 00:11:29.402
So they haven't understood just what a high level Egypt is,

231
00:11:29.841 --> 00:11:33.145
and because we understand Greece and Rome through

232
00:11:33.145 --> 00:11:36.882
the language, because we've inherited their languages,

233
00:11:36.882 --> 00:11:41.882
and we still learn Greek and Latin anyway even today,

234
00:11:41.885 --> 00:11:43.988
that's the starting point for us.

235
00:11:43.988 --> 00:11:45.757
So we think that's where it starts but

236
00:11:45.757 --> 00:11:47.258
actually think about it.

237
00:11:47.258 --> 00:11:50.694
It's highly developed, highly sophisticated stuff

238
00:11:50.694 --> 00:11:52.563
and it suddenly appears in Greece?

239
00:11:52.563 --> 00:11:54.232
No, doesn't make any sense.

240
00:11:54.232 --> 00:11:56.368
<v Regina>Doesn't make any sense.</v>

241
00:11:56.368 --> 00:11:58.803
Let's go back to another time,

242
00:11:58.803 --> 00:12:01.572
a time that I think is a really pivotal time in

243
00:12:01.572 --> 00:12:04.776
Egyptian history because this starts carrying us over

244
00:12:04.776 --> 00:12:08.480
into even Christianity and this was the time of the pharaoh

245
00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:13.480
Akhenaten and the glorious temple that was built.

246
00:12:14.785 --> 00:12:19.023
This was a very controversial character historically

247
00:12:19.023 --> 00:12:22.660
because there was an attempt on his part it appears

248
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:27.066
to reestablish a natural law, a natural connection with

249
00:12:27.066 --> 00:12:30.067
the sun and everything that the sun means and

250
00:12:30.067 --> 00:12:32.503
what it feeds the planet by way of information.

251
00:12:32.503 --> 00:12:34.406
<v ->Or as he called it, the power behind the sun.</v>

252
00:12:34.406 --> 00:12:35.907
<v Regina>The power behind the sun.</v>

253
00:12:35.907 --> 00:12:37.408
<v ->Which is the Aten.</v>

254
00:12:37.408 --> 00:12:39.243
<v Regina>Yes which is very, very interesting.</v>

255
00:12:39.243 --> 00:12:42.179
And he built this beautiful city, just a gleaming example

256
00:12:42.179 --> 00:12:45.349
in terms of architecture and beauty called Akhetaten, right?

257
00:12:45.349 --> 00:12:46.585
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

258
00:12:46.585 --> 00:12:48.753
<v Regina>And so let's talk about him and what happened</v>

259
00:12:48.753 --> 00:12:52.423
there and what was going on around him politically

260
00:12:52.423 --> 00:12:54.626
and the end of that and what it started leading to,

261
00:12:54.626 --> 00:12:57.027
and into the Essenes if you don't mind.

262
00:12:57.027 --> 00:13:00.065
<v ->Yes well the thing that's interesting about him is that as</v>

263
00:13:00.065 --> 00:13:03.801
you say, he wanted to get back to some basics, as it were.

264
00:13:03.801 --> 00:13:06.571
And I think as in a lot of revolutions,

265
00:13:06.571 --> 00:13:09.173
they start off with very good intentions

266
00:13:09.173 --> 00:13:11.509
but they can easily be hijacked.

267
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:15.013
And although one thing that may look like a good thing

268
00:13:15.013 --> 00:13:17.916
that he did in terms of closing down all the other temples

269
00:13:17.916 --> 00:13:22.652
around Egypt, because at the time when he was around,

270
00:13:22.652 --> 00:13:26.358
each temple was like a little mini power center.

271
00:13:26.358 --> 00:13:29.127
It had its own deities and so forth even though

272
00:13:29.127 --> 00:13:31.529
the whole thing could kind of come together to

273
00:13:31.529 --> 00:13:34.698
be united in the person of the pharaoh,

274
00:13:34.698 --> 00:13:38.269
say for example at the time of the Heb Sed festival.

275
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:42.307
That was something he wanted to change.

276
00:13:42.307 --> 00:13:44.975
So in a way what he did effectively was to

277
00:13:44.975 --> 00:13:47.744
remove his own checks and balances,

278
00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:50.981
these own little other power centers, and he removed

279
00:13:50.981 --> 00:13:54.685
those in order to get back to this basic thing.

280
00:13:54.685 --> 00:13:57.488
So that made him already immediately politically

281
00:13:57.488 --> 00:14:01.492
very vulnerable because he's removing these other things

282
00:14:01.492 --> 00:14:03.627
that could keep each other in balance because they could

283
00:14:03.627 --> 00:14:06.864
fight against each other if there was a kind of tension.

284
00:14:06.864 --> 00:14:09.833
So he probably thought he was doing the right thing

285
00:14:09.833 --> 00:14:12.369
and he probably thought he was getting back to a purer

286
00:14:12.369 --> 00:14:15.806
form of acknowledgment of the power of the sun.

287
00:14:15.806 --> 00:14:17.474
It's very difficult, this word worship,

288
00:14:17.474 --> 00:14:19.036
what does it really mean?

289
00:14:19.036 --> 00:14:20.010
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

290
00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.916
Instead of awareness or honoring and using it literally,

291
00:14:23.916 --> 00:14:26.450
having it as a useful aspect of our lives.

292
00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:29.487
<v ->Exactly, so that's very hard.</v>

293
00:14:29.487 --> 00:14:34.487
But what is kind of interesting in terms of how that

294
00:14:34.726 --> 00:14:38.396
really starts off a kind of whole monotheistic thing,

295
00:14:38.396 --> 00:14:41.866
because it's just the power of the sun that matters to him.

296
00:14:41.866 --> 00:14:45.201
So it's one god in that sense,

297
00:14:45.201 --> 00:14:50.201
is that at the time that he was alive there were these

298
00:14:50.607 --> 00:14:54.144
Jewish groups who existed in Egypt,

299
00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:56.379
what they refer to as the Habiru.

300
00:14:56.379 --> 00:14:59.885
Habiru coming down to us obviously as Hebrews,

301
00:14:59.885 --> 00:15:02.553
and they has arrived in Egypt quite a long time

302
00:15:02.553 --> 00:15:07.553
previously with the Hyksos, as they're called.

303
00:15:07.892 --> 00:15:11.062
And Habiru basically means people from the other side of the

304
00:15:11.062 --> 00:15:13.864
river and in this case it's the other side of the Euphrates.

305
00:15:13.864 --> 00:15:17.701
They'd come down from northern Turkey or northern

306
00:15:17.701 --> 00:15:20.773
Syria rather from the northern part of the Euphrates

307
00:15:20.773 --> 00:15:24.376
a long time earlier and they had infiltrated themselves

308
00:15:24.376 --> 00:15:29.376
into the Egyptian royal household.

309
00:15:29.446 --> 00:15:32.783
And there's a long of evidence say for example Joseph,

310
00:15:32.783 --> 00:15:34.685
the great Jewish patriarch,

311
00:15:34.685 --> 00:15:37.887
was a member of the Egyptian royal household.

312
00:15:37.887 --> 00:15:41.726
And so these people were very close to Akhenaten

313
00:15:41.726 --> 00:15:44.461
and it's said that he used one of their priests to run

314
00:15:44.461 --> 00:15:48.399
his big temple in Akhetaten for example.

315
00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:51.001
Now when his whole thing collapses,

316
00:15:51.001 --> 00:15:53.858
either he's murdered or assassinated or whatever happens.

317
00:15:53.858 --> 00:15:55.372
<v Regina>He was taken out, right?</v>

318
00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:56.808
<v ->He's taken out, whatever happens,</v>

319
00:15:56.808 --> 00:15:58.809
the whole thing starts to collapse.

320
00:15:58.809 --> 00:16:02.182
Then these Jewish people who are there at

321
00:16:02.182 --> 00:16:04.348
the time of the Exodus, all of that.

322
00:16:04.348 --> 00:16:08.785
The Mose, the Moses, Mose in this context meaning "son of."

323
00:16:08.785 --> 00:16:11.488
So whoever it was that was guiding out the Jews

324
00:16:11.488 --> 00:16:15.526
was son of somebody, cause Mose meaning in,

325
00:16:15.526 --> 00:16:20.097
Egyptian word meaning "son" as in Tutmoses, son of Tut.

326
00:16:20.097 --> 00:16:24.401
And what is quite possible is that there was a group

327
00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:27.938
of these people who got left behind on Elephantine

328
00:16:27.938 --> 00:16:32.042
Island in the Upper Nile near Aswan,

329
00:16:32.042 --> 00:16:35.212
and this Jewish community stayed there for a very long time.

330
00:16:35.212 --> 00:16:37.748
They were still there when the Persians invaded Egypt

331
00:16:37.748 --> 00:16:41.552
in about 600 B.C. or so.

332
00:16:41.552 --> 00:16:45.790
So if you assume that their Exodus happens, I'm not sure

333
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:49.761
the exact dates but say around 1200 B.C. or whatever.

334
00:16:49.761 --> 00:16:53.163
So possibly for a period of about 600 years

335
00:16:53.163 --> 00:16:55.900
these people have been left behind.

336
00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:00.504
They don't have all the same festivals that the other

337
00:17:00.504 --> 00:17:03.573
Jewish people have and they don't have the Exodus festivals

338
00:17:03.573 --> 00:17:06.911
in particular, so that's in itself kinda significant.

339
00:17:06.911 --> 00:17:10.315
But they do have others that are in parallel and then

340
00:17:10.315 --> 00:17:14.518
what is also then possible is that these people arrive

341
00:17:14.518 --> 00:17:19.518
at some later point in Israel, in Canaan, in Palestine.

342
00:17:21.259 --> 00:17:23.793
And it is possible that these people found themselves,

343
00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:26.163
built themselves a community at Qumran,

344
00:17:26.163 --> 00:17:28.798
which is on the Dead Sea not far from Jerusalem,

345
00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:32.136
and they have become known to us as the Essenes.

346
00:17:32.136 --> 00:17:35.106
So this is quite a lot of different time periods because

347
00:17:35.106 --> 00:17:37.608
you've got Akenhaten back in whenever it is--

348
00:17:37.608 --> 00:17:39.043
<v Regina>1800.</v>

349
00:17:39.043 --> 00:17:41.078
<v ->Or even earlier, whenever.</v>

350
00:17:41.078 --> 00:17:43.547
And then you have the Exodus, you have these people leaving.

351
00:17:43.547 --> 00:17:46.684
Some leaving, and some staying on Elephantine Island.

352
00:17:46.684 --> 00:17:48.953
The Persians arriving and finding them still there

353
00:17:48.953 --> 00:17:53.691
doing these strange variations of Jewish festivals,

354
00:17:53.691 --> 00:17:58.196
and then later on their arriving in Canaan,

355
00:17:58.196 --> 00:18:03.066
in Palestine in about probably the second century B.C.

356
00:18:03.066 --> 00:18:06.369
And the point about it is is that we only get to

357
00:18:06.369 --> 00:18:08.840
know them through the Dead Sea Scrolls, which are

358
00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.744
discovered in whenever it was, 1945, in recent history.

359
00:18:13.744 --> 00:18:17.180
Which are all buried in a cave off the Dead Sea and one

360
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:21.353
of these Dead Sea Scrolls is called the Copper Scroll.

361
00:18:21.353 --> 00:18:23.920
Now it's a man called Robert Feather who's actually done

362
00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.692
the work on this and he has identified that there are Greek

363
00:18:27.692 --> 00:18:31.394
letters which spell the name Akhenaten on this scroll,

364
00:18:31.394 --> 00:18:32.996
so that in itself is kinda quite strange.

365
00:18:32.996 --> 00:18:34.064
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>

366
00:18:34.064 --> 00:18:35.168
<v ->Interesting.</v>

367
00:18:35.168 --> 00:18:36.968
And one of the big controversial things about this

368
00:18:36.968 --> 00:18:41.238
Copper Scroll is it describes a treasure which is buried

369
00:18:41.238 --> 00:18:44.608
and temples that are destroyed and this kind of thing,

370
00:18:44.608 --> 00:18:47.378
and it has always been assumed that this treasure related

371
00:18:47.378 --> 00:18:50.781
to the treasure of the temple in Jerusalem.

372
00:18:50.781 --> 00:18:53.184
But there's no correlations because it describes a

373
00:18:53.184 --> 00:18:56.319
great big river and it describes all sorts of things.

374
00:18:56.319 --> 00:18:59.723
And what Robert Feather has worked out is that the city

375
00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:04.362
that this scroll describes correlates almost perfectly

376
00:19:04.362 --> 00:19:07.331
with Akhetaten, the city of Akhenaten.

377
00:19:07.331 --> 00:19:08.699
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

378
00:19:08.699 --> 00:19:12.202
<v ->And down to the very fact that it describes a certain</v>

379
00:19:12.202 --> 00:19:16.574
weight of gold in this scroll that's been hidden in

380
00:19:16.574 --> 00:19:20.277
a particular place and archaeologically discovered,

381
00:19:20.277 --> 00:19:23.248
there has been discoveries of a certain amount

382
00:19:23.248 --> 00:19:27.185
of gold that corresponds exactly to this amount

383
00:19:27.185 --> 00:19:29.019
described in the Copper Scroll.

384
00:19:29.019 --> 00:19:31.923
<v Regina>So this really changes the face of modern,</v>

385
00:19:31.923 --> 00:19:34.358
what has developed into the modern religions.

386
00:19:34.358 --> 00:19:35.426
<v ->Yes.</v>

387
00:19:35.426 --> 00:19:37.894
<v Regina>So I've read this in other books as well</v>

388
00:19:37.894 --> 00:19:40.130
that there's a certain amount of evidence when,

389
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:41.665
just take the House of David for example.

390
00:19:41.665 --> 00:19:43.366
<v ->Right.</v>

391
00:19:43.366 --> 00:19:45.002
<v Regina>The origins would be?</v>

392
00:19:45.002 --> 00:19:49.039
<v ->Well the House of David, you have to go back again</v>

393
00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:51.608
back to the time of Akhenhaten and so forth.

394
00:19:51.608 --> 00:19:53.911
Because here I've taken the work of a man

395
00:19:53.911 --> 00:19:56.980
called Ahmed Osman, who is an Egyptian writer,

396
00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:00.450
and he's come up with some very, very interesting ideas.

397
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:05.450
And part of his ideas are that David and Solomon, who are

398
00:20:06.457 --> 00:20:10.594
normally described as 10th century B.C. Jewish kings.

399
00:20:10.594 --> 00:20:12.763
He says there is no historical evidence for these

400
00:20:12.763 --> 00:20:15.299
people being Jewish or being kings at that time.

401
00:20:15.299 --> 00:20:18.301
He says these were actually Egyptian pharaohs.

402
00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:21.038
He says that David is Tutmoses the Third

403
00:20:21.038 --> 00:20:24.678
and Solomon is Amenhotep the Fourth.

404
00:20:24.678 --> 00:20:29.614
And so in fact, and David did, Tutmoses the Third

405
00:20:29.614 --> 00:20:32.583
did fight campaigns that happened in Jerusalem.

406
00:20:32.583 --> 00:20:37.583
Armageddon, Har Megiddo is a place outside Jerusalem

407
00:20:37.655 --> 00:20:40.257
and there were these campaigns that were fought,

408
00:20:40.257 --> 00:20:42.893
and it's more than likely that Jerusalem was a city

409
00:20:42.893 --> 00:20:47.564
of Tutmoses the Third and that there is some of

410
00:20:47.564 --> 00:20:51.469
the old building there underneath the great

411
00:20:53.537 --> 00:20:55.873
thing of the Rock, you know the Dome of the Rock.

412
00:20:55.873 --> 00:20:57.474
<v Regina>Dome of the Rock, yes.</v>

413
00:20:57.474 --> 00:21:00.010
<v ->Is very like Egyptian building.</v>

414
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:01.412
The slabs that are there,

415
00:21:01.412 --> 00:21:05.048
the big heavy slabs that are cut so perfectly and so forth

416
00:21:05.048 --> 00:21:08.752
are very similar to what you'll find in Egypt and he also

417
00:21:08.752 --> 00:21:13.257
fought campaigns right up to that northern Euphrates part

418
00:21:13.257 --> 00:21:17.662
where the original Hebrews came from, the land of Mitanni.

419
00:21:17.662 --> 00:21:20.532
And it's said in the Bible he had an empire

420
00:21:20.532 --> 00:21:23.167
from the Nile to the Euphrates.

421
00:21:23.167 --> 00:21:26.302
Well Tutmoses the Third did have an empire from the Nile

422
00:21:26.302 --> 00:21:29.840
to the Euphrates but then no Jewish king actually did.

423
00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.309
So there are an awful lot of reasons for thinking

424
00:21:32.309 --> 00:21:34.044
that David and Solomon.

425
00:21:34.044 --> 00:21:35.746
And the Solomon thing is interesting because

426
00:21:35.746 --> 00:21:38.148
that's a name meaning "peace" and Amenhotep

427
00:21:38.148 --> 00:21:41.451
had many diplomatic treaties to keep peace.

428
00:21:41.451 --> 00:21:43.687
And also his temple has never been found,

429
00:21:43.687 --> 00:21:45.957
they're still thinking it's in Jerusalem.

430
00:21:45.957 --> 00:21:49.693
But the description of his temple and his temple complex

431
00:21:49.693 --> 00:21:53.731
corresponds almost exactly to the Heb Sed festival courts

432
00:21:53.731 --> 00:21:57.902
that Amenhotep the Fourth built at Luxor in Egypt.

433
00:21:57.902 --> 00:22:01.738
Including down to the forests of Lebanon court where

434
00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:04.440
these big trees were brought, cedars of Lebanon by

435
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.444
the Phoenicians but to Egypt, not to Jerusalem.

436
00:22:08.444 --> 00:22:11.015
So there are a lot of correlations there and a lot

437
00:22:11.015 --> 00:22:14.685
of misunderstanding, kind of propaganda really

438
00:22:14.685 --> 00:22:19.590
of warping the whole historical thing.

439
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:22.794
And so really what you're ending up with is

440
00:22:22.794 --> 00:22:26.396
Akhenaten with his monotheistic type thing,

441
00:22:26.396 --> 00:22:29.800
these Hebrews who are clearly very influenced by him.

442
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.771
And then when the Essenes, these people possibly

443
00:22:33.771 --> 00:22:37.709
from Elephantine Island arrive in Palestine,

444
00:22:37.709 --> 00:22:39.810
there are already Jewish people there.

445
00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:41.778
They've already created their own temples because

446
00:22:41.778 --> 00:22:43.681
they came out through the Exodus.

447
00:22:43.681 --> 00:22:48.681
But what happens with the Akhenaten Essenes is because

448
00:22:48.786 --> 00:22:51.522
they stayed in Egypt the longest, they think they've been

449
00:22:51.522 --> 00:22:56.492
closest to the true originator, who they see as Akhenaten,

450
00:22:56.492 --> 00:22:59.264
and that therefore they feel morally superior

451
00:22:59.264 --> 00:23:01.831
to these Jews who are in Jerusalem.

452
00:23:01.831 --> 00:23:05.035
And that creates a huge amount of tension between

453
00:23:05.035 --> 00:23:09.906
Qumran and Jerusalem because they think that they've

454
00:23:09.906 --> 00:23:13.277
deteriorated in their festivals and they don't

455
00:23:13.277 --> 00:23:15.648
keep the right calendar and all this.

456
00:23:15.648 --> 00:23:18.649
Haven't got the right number of courtyards in their temple

457
00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:22.318
and all of that kind of thing so there's a lot of tension

458
00:23:22.318 --> 00:23:27.157
between the Essenes in the Dead Sea part and the

459
00:23:27.157 --> 00:23:30.228
Jews and the priesthood in Jerusalem.

460
00:23:30.228 --> 00:23:32.429
<v Regina>And yet the being who is thought to</v>

461
00:23:32.429 --> 00:23:35.200
be known as Jesus was also thought to be

462
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.268
heavily influenced by the Essenes.

463
00:23:37.268 --> 00:23:41.004
<v ->Well I think that's, there's different views on that.</v>

464
00:23:41.004 --> 00:23:46.004
And part of what I've tried to do is basically stick to

465
00:23:46.143 --> 00:23:49.513
as good a historical evidence as you can find.

466
00:23:49.513 --> 00:23:52.283
And I have to say one of the things that shocked me

467
00:23:52.283 --> 00:23:54.919
in my own research is I couldn't actually find any

468
00:23:54.919 --> 00:23:58.522
historical evidence for when Jesus existed.

469
00:23:58.522 --> 00:24:01.225
That's not to say he didn't exist but that's to say

470
00:24:01.225 --> 00:24:05.495
I couldn't find it in references to Roman documents

471
00:24:05.495 --> 00:24:08.499
or references in the Essenes' documents either.

472
00:24:08.499 --> 00:24:11.501
Because the Essenes, they clearly occupied Qumran

473
00:24:11.501 --> 00:24:13.904
at the time when he's supposed to have been alive,

474
00:24:13.904 --> 00:24:16.341
because they were there from the Second Century B.C.

475
00:24:16.341 --> 00:24:18.543
to the Second Century A.D.

476
00:24:18.543 --> 00:24:22.079
So that clearly follows that period when

477
00:24:22.079 --> 00:24:26.384
he should've been there so I have a slightly

478
00:24:26.384 --> 00:24:28.751
controversial view of all of that.

479
00:24:28.751 --> 00:24:31.554
<v Regina>Well, and the Romans were really</v>

480
00:24:31.554 --> 00:24:33.757
well-developed in terms of administration.

481
00:24:33.757 --> 00:24:35.725
<v ->Yes, they kept very good records.</v>

482
00:24:35.725 --> 00:24:37.294
<v Regina>Very good records.</v>
<v Lucy>Exactly.</v>

483
00:24:37.294 --> 00:24:39.998
<v Regina>And so you're saying as I recall from the book,</v>

484
00:24:39.998 --> 00:24:43.401
there is no record of this being having been there nor

485
00:24:43.401 --> 00:24:46.336
gone through what they had, in the Roman records as well.

486
00:24:46.336 --> 00:24:47.771
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

487
00:24:47.771 --> 00:24:50.473
Yeah there's no record in the Jewish records

488
00:24:50.473 --> 00:24:53.677
and there's no record in the Essenes' records.

489
00:24:53.677 --> 00:24:55.078
There's no record in,

490
00:24:55.078 --> 00:24:57.215
the Dead Sea Scrolls don't mention him at all

491
00:24:57.215 --> 00:25:00.618
and there's no record in the Roman records.

492
00:25:00.618 --> 00:25:04.020
But the Copper Scroll for example does refer to the

493
00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:07.858
House of Yeshu, so that could be another word for Jesus,

494
00:25:07.858 --> 00:25:10.493
which was in Akhetaten.

495
00:25:10.493 --> 00:25:13.664
So it could be that he was a wise teacher who maybe

496
00:25:13.664 --> 00:25:16.934
even existed at the time of Akhenaten, who knows?

497
00:25:16.934 --> 00:25:19.402
Maybe he was the Moses.

498
00:25:19.402 --> 00:25:22.907
I'm just saying that now but he could've been the one

499
00:25:22.907 --> 00:25:27.907
that led them out into Palestine, I don't know.

500
00:25:28.211 --> 00:25:31.782
But the point is is that what one has to remember

501
00:25:31.782 --> 00:25:36.185
is all of this Christian story is written so much later,

502
00:25:36.185 --> 00:25:39.121
and when it's written later it's written with all the

503
00:25:39.121 --> 00:25:43.159
prejudices and the agenda of those later writers.

504
00:25:43.159 --> 00:25:44.361
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

505
00:25:44.361 --> 00:25:46.196
<v ->So one should never forget that.</v>

506
00:25:46.196 --> 00:25:48.899
We kind of fool ourselves into thinking,

507
00:25:48.899 --> 00:25:52.770
"Oh it's the Biblical truth, it's the Gospel of Truth,

508
00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:54.170
and nothing but the truth."

509
00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.606
And we swear on the Bible and all this kind of thing,

510
00:25:56.606 --> 00:25:59.743
but actually it's just a piece of propaganda.

511
00:25:59.743 --> 00:26:03.181
You're lucky if something can be backed up by information--

512
00:26:03.181 --> 00:26:04.783
<v Regina>And this is true of everything.</v>

513
00:26:04.783 --> 00:26:07.117
It doesn't matter, historically in terms of

514
00:26:07.117 --> 00:26:09.219
historical texts and religion, everything.

515
00:26:09.219 --> 00:26:10.754
We're only trying to piece together.

516
00:26:10.754 --> 00:26:11.989
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

517
00:26:11.989 --> 00:26:13.790
<v Regina>And they are all filtered through the mind</v>

518
00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:16.660
of the authors of the day and their understanding,

519
00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.494
their politics of the day and so forth,

520
00:26:18.494 --> 00:26:20.430
and we can't really separate that.

521
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:22.633
Religious texts are not exempt from this.

522
00:26:22.633 --> 00:26:26.502
<v ->Exactly, and my feeling about the Jesus story is that</v>

523
00:26:26.502 --> 00:26:29.940
that was possibly put together because a certain

524
00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:34.511
kind of early Christian person needed facts,

525
00:26:34.511 --> 00:26:38.482
they needed an actual history to pin things onto.

526
00:26:38.482 --> 00:26:41.584
So they wanted to put it into a time and place that

527
00:26:41.584 --> 00:26:45.755
they could relate to, that it made sense to them.

528
00:26:45.755 --> 00:26:50.755
I mean there is evidence in the Bible and elsewhere

529
00:26:51.362 --> 00:26:56.362
that the Temple of Jerusalem was destroyed in 660 A.D.

530
00:26:58.269 --> 00:27:01.872
660 A.D., there's evidence of that and there are

531
00:27:01.872 --> 00:27:04.608
references to the destruction of the Great Temple

532
00:27:04.608 --> 00:27:06.509
in Jerusalem in the Bible.

533
00:27:06.509 --> 00:27:10.146
So these kind of things you can kind of go with,

534
00:27:10.146 --> 00:27:14.952
and the problem that they had is that, A, the Dead Sea

535
00:27:14.952 --> 00:27:19.122
Scrolls are being translated by the Catholic Church.

536
00:27:19.122 --> 00:27:23.126
A branch of them, Jesuits or whatever.

537
00:27:23.126 --> 00:27:25.763
So they've got a clear reason,

538
00:27:25.763 --> 00:27:29.333
a motive for not revealing certain information.

539
00:27:29.333 --> 00:27:31.367
Cause after all everything could collapse

540
00:27:31.367 --> 00:27:35.004
like a pack of cards if, and there's a story in

541
00:27:35.004 --> 00:27:39.778
the Dead Sea Scrolls that can be correlated to tie

542
00:27:39.778 --> 00:27:41.911
to events that happened around this spurious

543
00:27:41.911 --> 00:27:44.146
time that Jesus was supposed to be alive.

544
00:27:44.146 --> 00:27:49.146
And this is to do with the death of the righteous teacher by

545
00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:55.420
the wicked priest and also events to do with the betrayer.

546
00:27:56.193 --> 00:27:59.595
The Essenes are very worked up about the betrayer.

547
00:27:59.595 --> 00:28:01.998
Now the background to those two things,

548
00:28:01.998 --> 00:28:04.167
well first of all I should say that what the modern

549
00:28:04.167 --> 00:28:06.168
day Jesuits have done is they've placed all

550
00:28:06.168 --> 00:28:08.772
those stories into a much earlier time.

551
00:28:08.772 --> 00:28:11.309
They said that it must be second century B.C.

552
00:28:11.309 --> 00:28:13.477
but they have no historical, they have no reason,

553
00:28:13.477 --> 00:28:15.145
no evidence for doing that.

554
00:28:15.145 --> 00:28:18.048
It just suits their purposes to be able to do that.

555
00:28:18.048 --> 00:28:23.048
But actually the death of the teacher by the wicked priest

556
00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:28.220
can easily be referred to the so-called brother of Jesus

557
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.731
called James, who is pushed off the roof of the

558
00:28:33.731 --> 00:28:36.867
temple by Jannaeus, the wicked priest.

559
00:28:36.867 --> 00:28:40.202
That's kind of backed up in other information,

560
00:28:40.202 --> 00:28:43.207
and the betrayer is Paul.

561
00:28:43.207 --> 00:28:45.509
Now that's another whole really interesting story

562
00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:47.545
that makes one very suspicious about this

563
00:28:47.545 --> 00:28:50.780
whole origins of Christianity.

564
00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:54.226
Yes well the thing about Paul is that

565
00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.588
what's happening is you've got early Palestine,

566
00:28:59.588 --> 00:29:01.858
the Romans are in occupation.

567
00:29:01.858 --> 00:29:03.927
They haven't come up with the exact date when they've

568
00:29:03.927 --> 00:29:06.931
invaded Palestine but they're controlling Palestine,

569
00:29:06.931 --> 00:29:11.068
and what the Jewish priesthood in Jerusalem is very worried

570
00:29:11.068 --> 00:29:15.472
about is calling the wrath of the Romans down upon them

571
00:29:15.472 --> 00:29:17.774
and having their temple destroyed.

572
00:29:17.774 --> 00:29:21.378
And they're very worried about having this hostile group

573
00:29:21.378 --> 00:29:26.378
of Jews, the Essenes at Qumran on the Dead Sea.

574
00:29:26.583 --> 00:29:29.619
And they're very worried about them stirring things up

575
00:29:29.619 --> 00:29:32.188
because there's also a lot to do with the zealots,

576
00:29:32.188 --> 00:29:35.992
who are these guerrilla warfare tactic people.

577
00:29:35.992 --> 00:29:39.862
Like the IRA or whatever it is, terrorists.

578
00:29:39.862 --> 00:29:41.932
And they're very concerned about this,

579
00:29:41.932 --> 00:29:43.767
that if these people keep stirring it,

580
00:29:43.767 --> 00:29:46.137
they will bring the wrath of the Romans down.

581
00:29:46.137 --> 00:29:48.405
So what they did is they dispatched Paul.

582
00:29:48.405 --> 00:29:51.040
Now the thing that's misled us is it says in

583
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.345
the Bible they sent him to Damascus.

584
00:29:54.345 --> 00:29:56.980
Now the point about going to Damascus is Damascus is in

585
00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:01.884
Syria, it's way out of the jurisdiction of the Jewish Temple

586
00:30:01.884 --> 00:30:06.322
and also Damascus is possibly a code name for Qumran.

587
00:30:06.322 --> 00:30:09.159
In the Dead Sea Scrolls they've got lots of references to

588
00:30:09.159 --> 00:30:13.529
the Damascus code and scroll and all that kind of thing.

589
00:30:13.529 --> 00:30:17.802
So if you actually take the view that Damascus

590
00:30:17.802 --> 00:30:20.603
refers to Qumran, it makes sense.

591
00:30:20.603 --> 00:30:23.306
And then what happens is that Paul comes to the Essenes,

592
00:30:23.306 --> 00:30:25.309
and he's supposed to kind of talk them out of being

593
00:30:25.309 --> 00:30:28.946
so religiously aggressive and hostile and wanting to get rid

594
00:30:28.946 --> 00:30:32.115
of the Romans, who they refer to as the Kediaman.

595
00:30:32.115 --> 00:30:34.785
And there's the war scrolls in the Dead Sea Scrolls,

596
00:30:34.785 --> 00:30:36.820
very aggressive stuff and they want to fight

597
00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.721
them and all this kind of stuff.

598
00:30:38.721 --> 00:30:43.328
Anyway so he turns up at Qumran,

599
00:30:43.328 --> 00:30:46.964
but instead of trying to argue against them and trying

600
00:30:46.964 --> 00:30:50.633
to persuade them, he joins them and he becomes an

601
00:30:50.633 --> 00:30:54.170
initiate and he goes off into the wildness and he may

602
00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:57.874
even have gone as far as Petra, where they had a community,

603
00:30:57.874 --> 00:31:02.874
and he becomes a novitiate, part of their whole thing.

604
00:31:02.913 --> 00:31:05.448
And then after a bit while he's part of their community,

605
00:31:05.448 --> 00:31:08.485
it takes two or three years for him to join,

606
00:31:08.485 --> 00:31:11.554
he starts to argue with them about inviting new people

607
00:31:11.554 --> 00:31:15.558
in and not wanting to have to apply the law to them.

608
00:31:15.558 --> 00:31:18.162
Because one of the titles that the Essenes call themselves,

609
00:31:18.162 --> 00:31:21.164
they call themselves like the brothers of righteousness.

610
00:31:21.164 --> 00:31:24.468
They see themselves very much as protectors of the law,

611
00:31:24.468 --> 00:31:26.736
this is very important to them.

612
00:31:26.736 --> 00:31:29.572
And so he starts to set up his own communities

613
00:31:29.572 --> 00:31:31.875
where you don't have to have been circumcised,

614
00:31:31.875 --> 00:31:35.746
you don't have to have agreed to the law of the whole Jewish

615
00:31:35.746 --> 00:31:40.716
thing and when he does that, they regard him as a betrayer.

616
00:31:40.716 --> 00:31:43.152
They regard him as someone who's come into their community,

617
00:31:43.152 --> 00:31:45.656
learned about all their practices,

618
00:31:45.656 --> 00:31:49.158
joined them from the inside and then gone away,

619
00:31:49.158 --> 00:31:51.461
and gone away arguing with them.

620
00:31:51.461 --> 00:31:56.461
And that to them is an enormous betrayal of their trust.

621
00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.403
So that's why in the Copper Scroll when it,

622
00:31:59.403 --> 00:32:03.040
or in these scrolls when it describes the betrayer,

623
00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:07.377
it makes sense that it's him and it fits into the timescale.

624
00:32:07.377 --> 00:32:09.746
But there's no mention of Jesus in any of that,

625
00:32:09.746 --> 00:32:12.015
that's the slight fly in the ointment.

626
00:32:12.015 --> 00:32:14.918
So my way of thinking is is that as the whole Christian

627
00:32:14.918 --> 00:32:19.918
story develops, Paul takes on a line of early monotheistic

628
00:32:21.825 --> 00:32:24.093
thing because these Essenes are still very much

629
00:32:24.093 --> 00:32:27.197
monotheistic, they are worshiping the sun as well.

630
00:32:27.197 --> 00:32:29.999
They do their rituals to the sun when they get up

631
00:32:29.999 --> 00:32:31.968
in the morning and that kind of thing and it's

632
00:32:31.968 --> 00:32:34.804
still very much one God.

633
00:32:34.804 --> 00:32:37.440
He's possibly following in a line that develops

634
00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.876
into what we'd know as Gnosticism.

635
00:32:39.876 --> 00:32:43.447
But there are others in this community, particularly Peter,

636
00:32:43.447 --> 00:32:46.550
who are actually people who like facts,

637
00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:49.487
and it's the followers from that side of things that start

638
00:32:49.487 --> 00:32:53.156
to put together a story about when Jesus might have

639
00:32:53.156 --> 00:32:55.558
existed and where he might have lived and how it

640
00:32:55.558 --> 00:32:58.294
might have been and all of that.

641
00:32:58.294 --> 00:33:00.330
Because we know that the earliest Gospels weren't

642
00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:04.734
written until at least A.D. 70, so at least potentially

643
00:33:04.734 --> 00:33:08.037
30, 40 years after Jesus would have died,

644
00:33:08.037 --> 00:33:10.573
if that story were true.

645
00:33:10.573 --> 00:33:13.609
So already there's enough of a generational time

646
00:33:13.609 --> 00:33:17.112
for things to become very twisted and warped

647
00:33:17.112 --> 00:33:19.815
and who knows exactly when.

648
00:33:19.815 --> 00:33:21.484
And you were saying you wanted to

649
00:33:21.484 --> 00:33:23.452
talk about John the Baptist.

650
00:33:23.452 --> 00:33:25.589
Well the thing is John the Baptist,

651
00:33:25.589 --> 00:33:28.191
when he was talking about the coming of Jesus,

652
00:33:28.191 --> 00:33:31.094
he may have been talking about the second coming of Jesus

653
00:33:31.094 --> 00:33:32.963
because the first coming of Jesus may well have

654
00:33:32.963 --> 00:33:35.398
been this much earlier time, who knows?

655
00:33:35.398 --> 00:33:38.935
Maybe way back in ancient Egypt, who knows?

656
00:33:38.935 --> 00:33:43.373
And that John the Baptist was actually talking about

657
00:33:43.373 --> 00:33:46.709
something quite different and seeing that there could've

658
00:33:46.709 --> 00:33:50.346
been another time when he could have been incarnated.

659
00:33:50.346 --> 00:33:55.346
There is also a view among certain groups that for example,

660
00:33:55.819 --> 00:33:59.289
the early nativity story was actually to do with John

661
00:33:59.289 --> 00:34:02.325
the Baptist and not to do with Jesus.

662
00:34:02.325 --> 00:34:06.596
There are groups who think that that was all hijacked

663
00:34:06.596 --> 00:34:11.033
and re-written to fit the Jesus story and that it's

664
00:34:11.033 --> 00:34:14.838
actually all about John's early life.

665
00:34:14.838 --> 00:34:17.173
And it's very interesting that one of the routes

666
00:34:17.173 --> 00:34:19.074
through that we have back into all this is through

667
00:34:19.074 --> 00:34:21.345
the Knights Templars much later on,

668
00:34:21.345 --> 00:34:26.250
and we're talking about 12th, 13th century A.D.

669
00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:30.253
But that those people themselves venerated John

670
00:34:30.253 --> 00:34:33.589
rather than Jesus, that they had perhaps discovered

671
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:38.589
these old texts that gave the lie to all of this.

672
00:34:38.697 --> 00:34:41.831
And they would refer to themselves as the Johnites

673
00:34:41.831 --> 00:34:44.834
and his day was the day that they actually celebrated--

674
00:34:44.834 --> 00:34:46.203
<v Regina>June 24th.</v>

675
00:34:46.203 --> 00:34:47.503
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>

676
00:34:47.503 --> 00:34:50.139
Because what we mustn't forget is that the date

677
00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:53.944
of Jesus' birthday was decided by Pope,

678
00:34:53.944 --> 00:34:58.048
I think it's Pope Liberius in 300-something A.D.

679
00:34:58.048 --> 00:34:59.849
I can't remember the exact date,

680
00:34:59.849 --> 00:35:03.553
but that date of the 25th of December was actually

681
00:35:03.553 --> 00:35:07.257
the cult date of the birth of Mithras,

682
00:35:07.257 --> 00:35:09.926
who is a whole other thing altogether.

683
00:35:09.926 --> 00:35:11.828
<v ->So you know there we are--</v>

684
00:35:11.828 --> 00:35:13.497
<v Regina>You start going back into Babylonian texts, yes.</v>

685
00:35:13.497 --> 00:35:16.031
<v ->Yeah exactly, so there we are thinking that all this</v>

686
00:35:16.031 --> 00:35:19.968
Jesus story, it's true, it's there, you know nativity,

687
00:35:19.968 --> 00:35:24.239
and all the rest of it but actually you've got an arbitrary

688
00:35:24.239 --> 00:35:27.878
Pope deciding in the fourth century A.D.

689
00:35:27.878 --> 00:35:30.345
when the birth date of Jesus was.

690
00:35:30.345 --> 00:35:34.917
And think how many millions of Christians around the world

691
00:35:34.917 --> 00:35:38.756
don't know that simple fact that it's actually the Catholic

692
00:35:38.756 --> 00:35:42.991
Church who has decided when Jesus should be born.

693
00:35:42.991 --> 00:35:47.991
<v Regina>Right, and as you say if you go back in prior,</v>

694
00:35:48.064 --> 00:35:49.865
several millennia back you start

695
00:35:49.865 --> 00:35:52.335
seeing the same kind of story.

696
00:35:52.335 --> 00:35:54.538
The same dates for the same story around the virgin

697
00:35:54.538 --> 00:35:59.308
birth and so forth have already been documented.

698
00:35:59.308 --> 00:36:00.511
Not documented,

699
00:36:00.511 --> 00:36:03.179
but that's already part of the mythology or lore.

700
00:36:03.179 --> 00:36:04.748
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>

701
00:36:04.748 --> 00:36:08.750
I mean the problem that we have is that we can't separate

702
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:11.955
myth from reality because these people didn't write these

703
00:36:11.955 --> 00:36:15.359
things down as if they were true historic documents.

704
00:36:15.359 --> 00:36:19.495
They wrote them down as powerful stories.

705
00:36:19.495 --> 00:36:22.432
I mean I don't want to take anything away from the wisdom,

706
00:36:22.432 --> 00:36:24.967
the teachings, anything like that.

707
00:36:24.967 --> 00:36:28.738
That is all, I have no quarrel with any of that.

708
00:36:28.738 --> 00:36:32.574
The Christian religion in that sense to me is very

709
00:36:32.574 --> 00:36:36.312
important and totally powerful and very true.

710
00:36:36.312 --> 00:36:41.312
And his Sermons on the Mount,

711
00:36:42.584 --> 00:36:46.524
all the very wise sayings of Jesus,

712
00:36:46.524 --> 00:36:48.625
we should definitely listen to those.

713
00:36:48.625 --> 00:36:50.392
That is a very, very powerful message.

714
00:36:50.392 --> 00:36:52.429
I don't wish to take anything away from the message

715
00:36:52.429 --> 00:36:57.199
of Jesus but I think the very fact that the historical

716
00:36:57.199 --> 00:37:00.967
facts around him are so easy to query.

717
00:37:00.967 --> 00:37:02.538
<v Regina>Have been made convenient.</v>

718
00:37:02.538 --> 00:37:05.708
<v ->Have been made convenient, and they're so dubious.</v>

719
00:37:05.708 --> 00:37:07.611
And it's the fact that people,

720
00:37:07.611 --> 00:37:10.647
to me what that speaks of is people's need for a

721
00:37:10.647 --> 00:37:14.217
psychological construct, for something in their heads.

722
00:37:14.217 --> 00:37:17.919
It's people's need to believe that's the worrying thing

723
00:37:17.919 --> 00:37:22.919
and that's the bit I feel very, I want to argue with that.

724
00:37:23.959 --> 00:37:26.996
I feel very questioning of that because

725
00:37:26.996 --> 00:37:29.332
why do you need to believe these spurious facts?

726
00:37:29.332 --> 00:37:31.868
For example the Gnostic gospels which were

727
00:37:31.868 --> 00:37:36.868
buried at Nag Hammadi in about 300-something A.D.,

728
00:37:36.939 --> 00:37:39.775
they make no references to any historical facts

729
00:37:39.775 --> 00:37:43.512
to do with Jesus, they only dwell on his teachings.

730
00:37:43.512 --> 00:37:45.016
And that is at the end of the day what

731
00:37:45.016 --> 00:37:46.482
we should all be looking at,

732
00:37:46.482 --> 00:37:50.653
not tying ourselves down to rituals or Stations

733
00:37:50.653 --> 00:37:54.190
of the Cross and all of that kinda thing.

734
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:55.458
<v Regina>Right.</v>

735
00:37:55.458 --> 00:37:57.193
<v ->That doesn't get us anywhere.</v>

736
00:37:57.193 --> 00:37:59.227
<v Regina>No, and there's something that you wrote about.</v>

737
00:37:59.227 --> 00:38:02.665
Something to me I found very interesting,

738
00:38:02.665 --> 00:38:06.703
and this will bridge from the Egyptian times into what

739
00:38:06.703 --> 00:38:09.438
we've really come to be now and I'd like you to just put

740
00:38:09.438 --> 00:38:11.340
what you'd like to it, but I'm going to read from your book.

741
00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.541
<v ->Oh, right.</v>

742
00:38:12.541 --> 00:38:15.878
<v Regina>So this is on page 213 and this is</v>

743
00:38:15.878 --> 00:38:18.381
part of the Hermetica's prophecy.

744
00:38:18.381 --> 00:38:21.885
And this part I thought it just really spoke to me

745
00:38:21.885 --> 00:38:24.987
and maybe just set up the Hermetica,

746
00:38:24.987 --> 00:38:28.758
just set it up prior to my reading this prophecy.

747
00:38:28.758 --> 00:38:31.361
If you'll set up who the being was

748
00:38:31.361 --> 00:38:33.228
and where this prophecy came from.

749
00:38:33.228 --> 00:38:35.597
<v ->Where the Hermetica, how that developed?</v>

750
00:38:35.597 --> 00:38:37.766
Well that's kind of difficult,

751
00:38:37.766 --> 00:38:41.336
difficult to say exactly how the Hermetica developed

752
00:38:41.336 --> 00:38:43.840
because obviously some of that's written in Greek,

753
00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.544
so it's what the Greeks were told.

754
00:38:46.544 --> 00:38:48.911
But I mean it's supposed to be the teaching of

755
00:38:48.911 --> 00:38:53.911
Hermes Trismegistus and he's talking to his pupils,

756
00:38:54.883 --> 00:38:57.887
that's really how it kind of come about but

757
00:38:57.887 --> 00:39:00.056
the actual origins are very difficult to say.

758
00:39:00.056 --> 00:39:01.857
<v Regina>Okay that's fine, just a little background.</v>

759
00:39:01.857 --> 00:39:04.394
So this says that the Hermetica's prophecy

760
00:39:04.394 --> 00:39:06.261
continued with these words.

761
00:39:06.261 --> 00:39:08.998
"People" and this is when the change,

762
00:39:08.998 --> 00:39:12.168
when Egypt would fall, the Egyptian culture would fall and

763
00:39:12.168 --> 00:39:17.168
would be replaced with something new which was Roman, right.

764
00:39:17.574 --> 00:39:22.278
So, "At this time people will not cherish this entire world,

765
00:39:22.278 --> 00:39:24.548
a work of God beyond compare,

766
00:39:24.548 --> 00:39:27.182
they will prefer shadows to light and they

767
00:39:27.182 --> 00:39:30.186
will find death more expedient than life.

768
00:39:30.186 --> 00:39:32.322
No one will look up to Heaven."

769
00:39:32.322 --> 00:39:34.324
I-E the sun and stars.

770
00:39:34.324 --> 00:39:37.893
"The reverent will be thought mad and the irreverent wise.

771
00:39:37.893 --> 00:39:39.863
The lunatic will be thought brave and the

772
00:39:39.863 --> 00:39:42.365
scoundrel will be taken for a decent person.

773
00:39:42.365 --> 00:39:45.334
Soul," and this is to me very important,

774
00:39:45.334 --> 00:39:48.270
"Soul and all teachings about soul will be considered

775
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:52.008
not simply laughable but even illusory."

776
00:39:52.008 --> 00:39:55.645
Now what happened that took us from what we

777
00:39:55.645 --> 00:39:58.548
had previously known in these very high, advanced,

778
00:39:58.548 --> 00:40:01.417
sophisticated cultures, spiritually as well,

779
00:40:01.417 --> 00:40:03.353
to where we are now?

780
00:40:03.353 --> 00:40:04.754
And you're talking about a bit of the story

781
00:40:04.754 --> 00:40:06.889
but if you could just now draw a line.

782
00:40:06.889 --> 00:40:11.843
<v ->Yeah, well in terms of how that came about,</v>

783
00:40:13.061 --> 00:40:15.631
I mean the thing that's amazing about Egypt is how

784
00:40:15.631 --> 00:40:18.735
it's so consistent over such a long period of time.

785
00:40:18.735 --> 00:40:21.538
I mean literally thousands of years,

786
00:40:21.538 --> 00:40:24.106
that they sustained this amazing advanced

787
00:40:24.106 --> 00:40:27.344
civilization for such a long period.

788
00:40:27.344 --> 00:40:32.344
But then what happens is that Egypt becomes weakened,

789
00:40:32.515 --> 00:40:35.651
particularly by big environmental disasters.

790
00:40:35.651 --> 00:40:39.221
And the one that I identify I think as particularly key

791
00:40:39.221 --> 00:40:43.194
is what I think is usually commonly accepted is that

792
00:40:43.194 --> 00:40:45.961
shift from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age,

793
00:40:45.961 --> 00:40:48.831
which happens at about 1200 B.C.

794
00:40:48.831 --> 00:40:51.800
It's symbolized by the fall of Troy,

795
00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.370
which is on the edge of Turkey.

796
00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:58.707
And it's at that point that there's possibly a volcano

797
00:40:58.707 --> 00:41:03.112
in Iceland that blew up, the Hekla volcano,

798
00:41:03.112 --> 00:41:05.514
and that caused 20 years of famine.

799
00:41:05.514 --> 00:41:09.285
So when you get these enormous environmental stresses,

800
00:41:09.285 --> 00:41:11.287
stuff happens, bad stuff happens.

801
00:41:11.287 --> 00:41:15.324
In particular people go on the march looking for food

802
00:41:15.324 --> 00:41:19.662
and at that point they'd discovered the secret of iron,

803
00:41:19.662 --> 00:41:22.332
which hadn't been known before that.

804
00:41:22.332 --> 00:41:24.967
They didn't use iron, they only used bronze,

805
00:41:24.967 --> 00:41:29.105
which is this alloy of copper and tin.

806
00:41:29.105 --> 00:41:34.105
And so they were better-armed this time and Egypt

807
00:41:34.344 --> 00:41:36.645
manages to keep them out for quite a long time,

808
00:41:36.645 --> 00:41:40.082
Egypt's really a closed country a bit

809
00:41:40.082 --> 00:41:43.085
like China and Japan used to be.

810
00:41:43.085 --> 00:41:46.722
And the Indo-European tribes in particular were

811
00:41:46.722 --> 00:41:49.826
very much on the move and in about 600 B.C.

812
00:41:49.826 --> 00:41:52.296
the Persians are the first to invade,

813
00:41:52.296 --> 00:41:54.563
but they don't have a lot of impact on Egypt.

814
00:41:54.563 --> 00:41:56.766
The rituals still carry on in the Oasis,

815
00:41:56.766 --> 00:41:59.969
they still carry on their work.

816
00:41:59.969 --> 00:42:02.237
But it is definitely a weakening and it's after

817
00:42:02.237 --> 00:42:04.507
that that the Greeks start to come,

818
00:42:04.507 --> 00:42:09.507
they invade properly with Alexander the Great in 333 B.C.

819
00:42:09.578 --> 00:42:11.815
The Romans are very keen to get into Egypt.

820
00:42:11.815 --> 00:42:13.216
They want to know their secrets,

821
00:42:13.216 --> 00:42:15.886
they want to have access to all this knowledge

822
00:42:15.886 --> 00:42:18.588
and they don't actually get there until 30 B.C.

823
00:42:18.588 --> 00:42:22.124
around Cleopatra and Antony.

824
00:42:22.124 --> 00:42:26.495
So that is, it's at that point these Indo-European

825
00:42:26.495 --> 00:42:30.467
tribes arriving in these stages in Egypt.

826
00:42:30.467 --> 00:42:33.001
People who don't fully understand,

827
00:42:33.001 --> 00:42:37.806
who aren't given access to the secrets because

828
00:42:37.806 --> 00:42:41.043
in particular part of the secrets is this knowledge

829
00:42:41.043 --> 00:42:42.679
of how to move the big stones.

830
00:42:42.679 --> 00:42:44.179
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

831
00:42:44.179 --> 00:42:45.982
Advanced technology, yes.

832
00:42:45.982 --> 00:42:48.351
<v ->Yes I mean they can move these big stones 500</v>

833
00:42:48.351 --> 00:42:53.351
miles from Aswan up to Giza along the Nile.

834
00:42:54.491 --> 00:42:57.661
You know things that weigh, I don't know 50 tons.

835
00:42:57.661 --> 00:43:01.464
I mean huge things and as a friend of mine said,

836
00:43:01.464 --> 00:43:03.566
"Well if they had all this technology how come they

837
00:43:03.566 --> 00:43:06.602
just didn't drop it on their heads when the Romans arrived?"

838
00:43:06.602 --> 00:43:09.004
The point is the reason why that didn't happen is

839
00:43:09.004 --> 00:43:11.340
because by the time the Romans arrived in Egypt,

840
00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.676
there were no Egyptians there, they were Greeks.

841
00:43:13.676 --> 00:43:14.943
<v Regina>Right.</v>

842
00:43:14.943 --> 00:43:17.513
<v ->The Greeks, the Ptolemies, they were ruling Egypt</v>

843
00:43:17.513 --> 00:43:20.416
but the difference between Alexander the Great

844
00:43:20.416 --> 00:43:23.152
and your usual conqueror is that he invaded

845
00:43:23.152 --> 00:43:25.321
Egypt because he loved it.

846
00:43:25.321 --> 00:43:27.723
He wanted to know more about Egypt,

847
00:43:27.723 --> 00:43:31.161
so he was responsible for creating Alexandria,

848
00:43:31.161 --> 00:43:33.329
the city and the great library.

849
00:43:33.329 --> 00:43:34.997
He wanted to bring all the knowledge from

850
00:43:34.997 --> 00:43:37.667
the ancient world into this place and he wanted

851
00:43:37.667 --> 00:43:40.970
to become more Egyptian than Greek.

852
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:42.904
But nevertheless,

853
00:43:42.904 --> 00:43:45.574
they still weren't given access to all the secrets.

854
00:43:45.574 --> 00:43:48.379
The secrets, they didn't totally die out but they went

855
00:43:48.379 --> 00:43:52.181
very much underground and they went elsewhere,

856
00:43:52.181 --> 00:43:55.851
and they were kind of encapsulated in something

857
00:43:55.851 --> 00:43:58.055
that we refer to as alchemy.

858
00:43:58.055 --> 00:44:00.190
I mean I can talk to you about that if you want

859
00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:03.226
but it's quite another deep subject really,

860
00:44:03.226 --> 00:44:06.596
and that's what disappeared really.

861
00:44:06.596 --> 00:44:09.698
And so yes they were in Egypt,

862
00:44:09.698 --> 00:44:11.968
but they were only really there superficially.

863
00:44:11.968 --> 00:44:13.803
And an awful lot of the building that you

864
00:44:13.803 --> 00:44:16.739
see in Egypt today is actually Greek.

865
00:44:16.739 --> 00:44:19.908
Even though it looks Egyptian, it's actually Greek,

866
00:44:19.908 --> 00:44:21.578
it's the Ptolemies.

867
00:44:21.578 --> 00:44:23.779
And then it's really just a question of how much they

868
00:44:23.779 --> 00:44:27.230
understood as to how much we understand.

869
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:29.018
<v Regina>Which is fascinating because that</v>

870
00:44:29.018 --> 00:44:32.420
really brings us back to the present,

871
00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:34.889
which is a lot of that knowledge is now surfacing.

872
00:44:34.889 --> 00:44:36.091
<v ->Yes.</v>

873
00:44:36.091 --> 00:44:38.160
<v Regina>From underground sources and from within</v>

874
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:41.932
the collective body of memory of those who may be

875
00:44:41.932 --> 00:44:44.201
incarnating now who were there at that time.

876
00:44:44.201 --> 00:44:49.037
So these technological mysteries are being revealed

877
00:44:49.037 --> 00:44:52.542
and they're being, as far as we understand,

878
00:44:52.542 --> 00:44:56.045
even utilized within elements and arms

879
00:44:56.045 --> 00:44:58.053
of the various militaries around the world.

880
00:44:58.053 --> 00:44:59.917
But cloaked and kept away from

881
00:44:59.917 --> 00:45:01.484
the people's view for the time being.

882
00:45:01.484 --> 00:45:06.122
So it's back and it will be continuing to surface throughout

883
00:45:06.122 --> 00:45:09.459
as our knowledge continues to surface within us,

884
00:45:09.459 --> 00:45:11.459
our memory continues to surface.

885
00:45:11.459 --> 00:45:14.362
<v ->But the thing is is it has to be done from the heart</v>

886
00:45:14.362 --> 00:45:16.799
and that's the problem is that these are very powerful

887
00:45:16.799 --> 00:45:20.002
things and that's what the Egyptians took so seriously,

888
00:45:20.002 --> 00:45:23.338
was their responsibility not to allow this knowledge

889
00:45:23.338 --> 00:45:25.274
to fall into the wrong hands.

890
00:45:25.274 --> 00:45:27.275
Because if it didn't come from the heart and

891
00:45:27.275 --> 00:45:31.246
it wasn't pure and meant in the right way

892
00:45:31.246 --> 00:45:33.516
then it really couldn't be revealed.

893
00:45:33.516 --> 00:45:38.053
And we're still too much I think gripped in a Roman mindset,

894
00:45:38.053 --> 00:45:41.290
in a left-brain way of looking at the world.

895
00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:43.826
It's still too powerful that really for the

896
00:45:43.826 --> 00:45:46.228
full knowledge to be revealed.

897
00:45:46.228 --> 00:45:47.863
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

898
00:45:47.863 --> 00:45:50.933
But on the other hand, sadly, it already has been co-opted

899
00:45:50.933 --> 00:45:54.971
by the very forces that really shouldn't have control of it.

900
00:45:54.971 --> 00:45:57.606
But as you say, not fully understood yet.

901
00:45:57.606 --> 00:45:59.876
Only to a certain extent, otherwise it probably

902
00:45:59.876 --> 00:46:02.844
would have been utilized, and poorly by now.

903
00:46:02.844 --> 00:46:06.716
So we can kind of thank goodness for that.

904
00:46:06.716 --> 00:46:10.987
<v ->And you know in a funny way the skeptics save us</v>

905
00:46:10.987 --> 00:46:14.890
because the skeptics need proof and when you

906
00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:17.793
want to do something very extraordinary,

907
00:46:17.793 --> 00:46:21.464
their lack of belief overrides it all and it doesn't happen.

908
00:46:21.464 --> 00:46:23.065
<v Regina>Yes, it's true.</v>

909
00:46:23.065 --> 00:46:24.467
<v ->They'll never get to it.</v>

910
00:46:24.467 --> 00:46:26.268
<v Regina>It cannot be proven in the light of</v>

911
00:46:26.268 --> 00:46:27.903
that kind of mental influence even.

912
00:46:27.903 --> 00:46:29.305
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

913
00:46:29.305 --> 00:46:31.274
<v Regina>Yeah anything alchemical, which is beautiful.</v>

914
00:46:31.274 --> 00:46:34.077
So there is a fail-safe in there.

915
00:46:34.077 --> 00:46:37.880
<v ->There is, it's their own skepticism. (laughs)</v>

916
00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:40.348
<v Regina>So excuse me. (coughs)</v>

917
00:46:40.348 --> 00:46:42.353
Any final thought Lucy, from this point?

918
00:46:42.353 --> 00:46:44.786
I mean we'll just encourage people to get

919
00:46:44.786 --> 00:46:46.857
a copy of the book and read it for themselves

920
00:46:46.857 --> 00:46:48.457
because there's just so much more,

921
00:46:48.457 --> 00:46:50.293
we've only skipped along just a couple

922
00:46:50.293 --> 00:46:52.361
of strands of thought in this book.

923
00:46:52.361 --> 00:46:54.931
Anything regarding this conversation that

924
00:46:54.931 --> 00:46:56.798
you'd like to wrap it up with?

925
00:46:56.798 --> 00:46:59.501
<v ->Well I think the thing is is that really</v>

926
00:46:59.501 --> 00:47:02.138
we must take the past more seriously.

927
00:47:02.138 --> 00:47:04.639
The past has had so much to teach us.

928
00:47:04.639 --> 00:47:07.376
We need to approach it with greater respect

929
00:47:07.376 --> 00:47:10.279
and in particular the thing that they really

930
00:47:10.279 --> 00:47:12.748
understood was a more holistic view of things.

931
00:47:12.748 --> 00:47:14.349
They were right-brained,

932
00:47:14.349 --> 00:47:16.384
well they were both left and right-brained.

933
00:47:16.384 --> 00:47:19.188
They could integrate both sides of their brains

934
00:47:19.188 --> 00:47:21.657
and so they worked with their intuition

935
00:47:21.657 --> 00:47:23.426
and they worked with their reason.

936
00:47:23.426 --> 00:47:26.929
Neither thing was more important than the other.

937
00:47:26.929 --> 00:47:30.065
They understood how to connect subjective with objective

938
00:47:30.065 --> 00:47:33.635
and all of those paradoxes that we don't understand fully,

939
00:47:33.635 --> 00:47:37.974
cause we are taught to value scientific objective

940
00:47:37.974 --> 00:47:40.777
more highly than the intuitive.

941
00:47:40.777 --> 00:47:43.145
But you need both and my book writes

942
00:47:43.145 --> 00:47:45.180
about that very clearly.

943
00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:48.551
This need to integrate and the importance of that.

944
00:47:48.551 --> 00:47:50.987
So I think if we go back to the ancient past and we

945
00:47:50.987 --> 00:47:55.156
realize that the story we've told ourselves isn't true.

946
00:47:55.156 --> 00:47:57.526
That we actually go, "Hang on a minute,

947
00:47:57.526 --> 00:47:59.129
what really did happen?"

948
00:47:59.129 --> 00:48:02.031
And we look at it again with greater respect, then we

949
00:48:02.031 --> 00:48:07.031
can start to reveal to ourselves what really did happen.

950
00:48:07.035 --> 00:48:09.605
And the fact that scientific knowledge for example,

951
00:48:09.605 --> 00:48:12.008
didn't come out of experimentation,

952
00:48:12.008 --> 00:48:14.710
it was directly-accessed information.

953
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:16.880
And when people can understand that,

954
00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:18.813
then they can approach modern,

955
00:48:18.813 --> 00:48:21.383
I mean what I'm talking about is shamanic ritual,

956
00:48:21.383 --> 00:48:24.486
shamanism, we haven't talked about that today

957
00:48:24.486 --> 00:48:26.522
but you know that's another conversation.

958
00:48:26.522 --> 00:48:29.424
But they can approach modern-day shaman with more

959
00:48:29.424 --> 00:48:32.427
respect and think, "We can learn from these people."

960
00:48:32.427 --> 00:48:36.031
Not just treat them as anthropological curiosities that's

961
00:48:36.031 --> 00:48:39.434
something that's wild and happens in the jungles of Peru,

962
00:48:39.434 --> 00:48:41.303
that these are people who really have powerful

963
00:48:41.303 --> 00:48:43.874
messages for us and we should be listening.

964
00:48:43.874 --> 00:48:46.941
Because the earth is at a critical time and we all need

965
00:48:46.941 --> 00:48:50.479
to come together and we need to look after our planet

966
00:48:50.479 --> 00:48:52.982
so that we can continue to live here.

967
00:48:52.982 --> 00:48:54.684
But with truth and beauty,

968
00:48:54.684 --> 00:48:57.321
that's the thing that's really key.

969
00:48:57.321 --> 00:49:00.423
And really my book is just part of a message to say,

970
00:49:00.423 --> 00:49:03.992
"Look again, take another look and have respect

971
00:49:03.992 --> 00:49:06.361
and think of life in a different way."

972
00:49:06.361 --> 00:49:08.665
Don't go for this end justifies the means,

973
00:49:08.665 --> 00:49:11.066
which is the Roman way of thinking which is still

974
00:49:11.066 --> 00:49:15.237
very much present in corporate America and all of that.

975
00:49:15.237 --> 00:49:18.273
But look at it as the ends are part of the means and the

976
00:49:18.273 --> 00:49:20.877
means are part of the end and we are interconnected,

977
00:49:20.877 --> 00:49:23.613
we are part of the land and the land is part of us,

978
00:49:23.613 --> 00:49:27.249
not it's just there for us to exploit for our own purposes.

979
00:49:27.249 --> 00:49:30.987
And that's really my message is that we need to

980
00:49:30.987 --> 00:49:33.188
think about it and put it into that context,

981
00:49:33.188 --> 00:49:36.842
reconnect with the ancient past.

982
00:49:37.325 --> 00:49:39.328
<v Regina>Beautifully said and thank you so much</v>

983
00:49:39.328 --> 00:49:41.263
for your time and for your hospitality,

984
00:49:41.263 --> 00:49:43.866
we're out here on, how much land do you have here?

985
00:49:43.866 --> 00:49:45.268
<v ->A couple a hundred acres.</v>

986
00:49:45.268 --> 00:49:46.870
<v Regina>Couple hundred acres and we--</v>

987
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:48.236
<v ->Old England.</v>

988
00:49:48.236 --> 00:49:50.841
<v Regina>Old England and very little--</v>

989
00:49:50.841 --> 00:49:53.408
<v ->Oak trees, 600 year old oak trees.</v>

990
00:49:53.408 --> 00:49:55.243
<v Regina>Yes, I got to commune with your oak</v>

991
00:49:55.243 --> 00:49:58.848
trees yesterday, which I love ancient oaks,

992
00:49:58.848 --> 00:50:03.384
and wake up to the sound of your cows in the morning.

993
00:50:03.384 --> 00:50:05.353
Thank you for putting us up,

994
00:50:05.353 --> 00:50:07.622
this has been a wonderful journey for us as well.

995
00:50:07.622 --> 00:50:11.577
<v ->It's my privilege too, thank you for coming.</v>

996
00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:14.629
<v ->You can find a copy of "Approaching Chaos"</v>

997
00:50:14.629 --> 00:50:16.865
on Amazon and other major book sellers.

998
00:50:16.865 --> 00:50:19.300
On similar topics you might also enjoy my interviews

999
00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:22.637
with William Henry, Jose Arguedas, and Walter Cruttenden.

1000
00:50:22.637 --> 00:50:25.892
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1001
00:50:27.743 --> 00:50:32.743
(up-temp drumbeat)
