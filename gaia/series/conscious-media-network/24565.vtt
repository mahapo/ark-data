00:00:06.346 --> 00:00:09.026
<v ->What do Jesus, Thoth, the Anunnaki,</v>

2
00:00:09.026 --> 00:00:11.246
and 2012 all have in common?

3
00:00:11.246 --> 00:00:12.806
That's what I asked Tricia McCannon,

4
00:00:12.806 --> 00:00:15.766
and to find the answer, you'll need to watch this video.

5
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.925
Tricia's expertise is in the area of the great mysteries,

6
00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:21.281
and she's devoted her life to uncovering,

7
00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:23.001
both through academic process

8
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:24.681
and through clairvoyance,

9
00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:26.301
the mysteries that have driven the religious

10
00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:28.421
and spiritual practices throughout history.

11
00:00:28.421 --> 00:00:31.001
She's highly skilled at connecting the dots

12
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:33.341
from our ancient pasts to our modern beliefs.

13
00:00:33.341 --> 00:00:36.362
And steeped into the Kabbalian and Hermetic teachings.

14
00:00:36.362 --> 00:00:39.682
In short, she embraces a wide swath of esoteric knowledge,

15
00:00:39.682 --> 00:00:42.591
which we had a wonderful time discussing.

16
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:45.941
Okay, here's the $64,000 question.

17
00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:48.881
What do the Anunnaki, Thoth, and Jesus

18
00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:51.441
all have in common?

19
00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:54.222
<v ->Well you certainly don't pull any punches, do you?</v>

20
00:00:54.222 --> 00:00:55.641
<v Regina>No.</v>

21
00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:57.322
<v ->Well, I would certainly say that Thoth,</v>

22
00:00:57.322 --> 00:00:59.642
being the master of masters

23
00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:02.382
and the God of Wisdom in Ancient Egypt,

24
00:01:02.382 --> 00:01:05.062
has a lot of common with Jesus.

25
00:01:05.062 --> 00:01:09.582
Jesus and Thoth are two of the four great kumaras.

26
00:01:09.582 --> 00:01:13.181
Now Kumara is a Sanskrit word meaning son.

27
00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:15.082
And so they're spoken of in the Vedas

28
00:01:15.082 --> 00:01:19.601
as the four sons of God that periodically return to Earth,

29
00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:21.342
reincarnated on Earth,

30
00:01:21.342 --> 00:01:23.321
in order to bring enlightenment to humanity.

31
00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:26.401
Within the great mystery religions of the past,

32
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:30.401
which fortunately are beginning to be reborn in our age,

33
00:01:30.401 --> 00:01:32.842
it was really taught that there were

34
00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:35.542
these great eons or cycles of time.

35
00:01:35.542 --> 00:01:38.262
And these solar lords, these great solar lords,

36
00:01:38.262 --> 00:01:40.641
came between the change of the ages.

37
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:42.461
Much as we know that Jesus incarnated between

38
00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:45.562
the Age of Aries and the Age of Pisces.

39
00:01:45.562 --> 00:01:47.201
And, of course, now we can't help but notice

40
00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:48.702
that we're right on the verge,

41
00:01:48.702 --> 00:01:50.381
ending in the Age of Pisces

42
00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:52.382
and going into the Age of Aquarius.

43
00:01:52.382 --> 00:01:54.622
So certainly, it does seem that one of these

44
00:01:54.622 --> 00:01:57.302
great solar divinities, if you will,

45
00:01:57.302 --> 00:02:01.194
who comes periodically in human, or mortal,

46
00:02:01.194 --> 00:02:02.934
or in the case of the Anunnaki gods,

47
00:02:02.934 --> 00:02:05.854
relatively immortal form,

48
00:02:05.854 --> 00:02:09.596
do come to Earth in order to do,

49
00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:11.813
let us say, raise the Kundalini of the planet,

50
00:02:11.813 --> 00:02:14.973
and to bring the hope of enlightenment

51
00:02:14.973 --> 00:02:17.314
once more to mankind's door.

52
00:02:17.314 --> 00:02:18.213
<v Regina>That is correct.</v>

53
00:02:18.213 --> 00:02:19.933
You just won a new washer and dryer.

54
00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:21.134
(laughing)

55
00:02:21.134 --> 00:02:23.253
<v ->You asked me a question.</v>

56
00:02:23.253 --> 00:02:24.634
<v Regina>I'm just teasing.</v>

57
00:02:24.634 --> 00:02:27.153
But, okay, now in setting that up

58
00:02:27.153 --> 00:02:28.754
a lot of people listening to this,

59
00:02:28.754 --> 00:02:32.054
we have a well-educated audience.

60
00:02:32.054 --> 00:02:34.674
And they would say,

61
00:02:34.674 --> 00:02:36.753
Anunnaki, were does Anunnaki come in,

62
00:02:36.753 --> 00:02:38.634
because you look at Zacheria Sitchin,

63
00:02:38.634 --> 00:02:40.413
David Icke, and many other people's work,

64
00:02:40.413 --> 00:02:42.533
and often times we think of the Anunnaki

65
00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:46.053
as a more predatory species that arrived on the planet

66
00:02:46.053 --> 00:02:48.453
on the planet and created slave species,

67
00:02:48.453 --> 00:02:50.594
but that's not what you're speaking of and please,

68
00:02:50.594 --> 00:02:53.254
at this point, delineate between the two.

69
00:02:53.254 --> 00:02:55.494
<v ->Well this is, of course, a common misperception</v>

70
00:02:55.494 --> 00:02:57.014
by many people, especially people who have

71
00:02:57.014 --> 00:02:58.994
listened to David Icke.

72
00:02:58.994 --> 00:03:01.594
And I think David Icke is a lovely person in many ways,

73
00:03:01.594 --> 00:03:04.154
but certainly he was a British journalist.

74
00:03:04.154 --> 00:03:05.214
He was not a mystic.

75
00:03:05.214 --> 00:03:07.074
And so consequently, when he brought forward

76
00:03:07.074 --> 00:03:10.194
his interpretation, it was interpretation really,

77
00:03:10.194 --> 00:03:12.114
simply-based on trying to put together

78
00:03:12.114 --> 00:03:14.134
a whole bunch of pieces of the puzzle,

79
00:03:14.134 --> 00:03:16.874
around the Illuminati and what he perceived

80
00:03:16.874 --> 00:03:19.053
to be the dark forces.

81
00:03:19.053 --> 00:03:21.434
Where he was saying two plus two equals five,

82
00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:23.353
or two plus two equals seven.

83
00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:25.333
And, unfortunately, it's created great misperception

84
00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:26.594
for a lot of people.

85
00:03:26.594 --> 00:03:28.753
Let's just sort of back up and define

86
00:03:28.753 --> 00:03:30.413
who the Anunnaki are.

87
00:03:30.413 --> 00:03:32.234
The term Anunnaki means, literally,

88
00:03:32.234 --> 00:03:34.414
those who came from, to Earth.

89
00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:37.014
Those who came to Earth from another place.

90
00:03:37.014 --> 00:03:39.354
So, when we begin to look at the work

91
00:03:39.354 --> 00:03:41.354
of the wonderful Zacheria Sitchin, who was,

92
00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:43.874
of course, a Jewish scholar, who was about

93
00:03:43.874 --> 00:03:45.653
one of 10,000 people on the planet

94
00:03:45.653 --> 00:03:48.697
that could read Sumerian cuneiform text,

95
00:03:48.697 --> 00:03:51.976
he spent about 30 years of his life or more

96
00:03:51.976 --> 00:03:54.636
in his Earth Mysteries Chronicles,

97
00:03:54.636 --> 00:03:57.456
bringing forth information that were

98
00:03:57.456 --> 00:03:59.736
translation of the Sumerian text,

99
00:03:59.736 --> 00:04:01.836
that went back in time and talked about

100
00:04:01.836 --> 00:04:03.956
the fact that, basically these were very

101
00:04:03.956 --> 00:04:06.717
tall, long-lived human beings.

102
00:04:06.717 --> 00:04:09.016
And their life cycles were tied to the

103
00:04:09.016 --> 00:04:11.136
orbital rotation of their planet,

104
00:04:11.136 --> 00:04:13.096
which was 3,600 years.

105
00:04:13.096 --> 00:04:16.176
That was one of, one of their years equal

106
00:04:16.176 --> 00:04:18.556
3,600 of our years.

107
00:04:18.556 --> 00:04:21.216
Consequently, it, you know, if you think about us

108
00:04:21.216 --> 00:04:24.456
living to be maybe 100, at a good age,

109
00:04:24.456 --> 00:04:26.836
and that would immediately mean that if they lived

110
00:04:26.836 --> 00:04:30.477
equivalent amounts of time, it would be 36,000 years.

111
00:04:30.477 --> 00:04:34.716
Now on their planet, it appears that they age so very slowly

112
00:04:34.716 --> 00:04:36.256
that they are some place between

113
00:04:36.256 --> 00:04:40.256
500,000 and a million years as one life cycle,

114
00:04:40.256 --> 00:04:42.696
a normal life cycle for one of them.

115
00:04:42.696 --> 00:04:45.296
When they came to this planet, unfortunately,

116
00:04:45.296 --> 00:04:47.536
their life cycles did slow down a bit,

117
00:04:47.536 --> 00:04:50.736
so that they aged a bit quicker.

118
00:04:50.736 --> 00:04:53.436
But their entire reason for coming to our planet

119
00:04:53.436 --> 00:04:56.537
was that they had a geologic catastrophe going on,

120
00:04:56.537 --> 00:04:58.016
on their planet.

121
00:04:58.016 --> 00:04:59.916
Which was that, as we've noticed,

122
00:04:59.916 --> 00:05:02.696
as the ozone layer on our planet thins,

123
00:05:02.696 --> 00:05:04.836
we wind up having places where the sun

124
00:05:04.836 --> 00:05:07.076
is so intensely bright that it burns our crops.

125
00:05:07.076 --> 00:05:08.356
They had this same sort of thing happening

126
00:05:08.356 --> 00:05:09.756
on their planet.

127
00:05:09.756 --> 00:05:11.436
Their scientists looked for a solution.

128
00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:13.716
The solution was to spinning gold particles,

129
00:05:13.716 --> 00:05:15.736
somehow, in the atmosphere.

130
00:05:15.736 --> 00:05:17.196
We don't understand that technology,

131
00:05:17.196 --> 00:05:19.976
but we know that when we put gold foil sheeting

132
00:05:19.976 --> 00:05:22.116
over the windows of a space capsule,

133
00:05:22.116 --> 00:05:24.656
it does, in fact, block out the cosmic rays.

134
00:05:24.656 --> 00:05:28.816
So they came to Earth, according to the Sumerian Tablets.

135
00:05:28.816 --> 00:05:33.816
Around 145,000 years ago, something like that.

136
00:05:34.874 --> 00:05:36.314
Now, there were many forms of humans

137
00:05:36.314 --> 00:05:37.874
on the planet, at that time.

138
00:05:37.874 --> 00:05:40.754
It certainly appears that Neanderthal was here,

139
00:05:40.754 --> 00:05:43.034
and Cro-Magnon was here at that time.

140
00:05:43.034 --> 00:05:44.554
It's also conceivable that there was some

141
00:05:44.554 --> 00:05:47.254
form of Homo sapien sapien

142
00:05:47.254 --> 00:05:49.014
on the planet at that time.

143
00:05:49.014 --> 00:05:52.074
And I'm eluding now to some of the works of

144
00:05:52.074 --> 00:05:54.334
Michael Cremo, and Richard Thompson,

145
00:05:54.334 --> 00:05:56.754
and Forbidden Archeology.

146
00:05:56.754 --> 00:05:58.894
But the traditional version now

147
00:05:58.894 --> 00:06:02.154
is that Homo sapien sapien arrived

148
00:06:02.154 --> 00:06:03.994
around 200,000 years.

149
00:06:03.994 --> 00:06:07.594
And this is commensurate or cooperative with

150
00:06:07.594 --> 00:06:10.057
the Sumerian cuneiform text,

151
00:06:10.057 --> 00:06:11.137
that talk about the fact that,

152
00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:12.257
when their own people got tired

153
00:06:12.257 --> 00:06:13.237
tired of working in the mines,

154
00:06:13.237 --> 00:06:14.817
after 10 or 20,000 years,

155
00:06:14.817 --> 00:06:17.177
that'd be a pretty hard sentence,

156
00:06:17.177 --> 00:06:19.677
even if you're trying to save your planet.

157
00:06:19.677 --> 00:06:21.137
There was a whole rebellion.

158
00:06:21.137 --> 00:06:22.497
They looked around and said,

159
00:06:22.497 --> 00:06:24.637
"Well, okay, there is some species here

160
00:06:24.637 --> 00:06:28.637
that we can, perhaps, jump-start their DNA,

161
00:06:28.637 --> 00:06:30.397
and move them from Cro-Magnon man

162
00:06:30.397 --> 00:06:32.057
to Homo sapien sapiens.

163
00:06:32.057 --> 00:06:34.017
And so doing, helping that species to make

164
00:06:34.017 --> 00:06:36.357
an evolutionary leap ahead of time.

165
00:06:36.357 --> 00:06:39.517
And, at the same time, having some kind of worker bee.

166
00:06:39.517 --> 00:06:43.136
So, within the Anunnaki camp,

167
00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:45.297
they're basically two divisions.

168
00:06:45.297 --> 00:06:48.057
The house of Enlil, which was primarily

169
00:06:48.057 --> 00:06:50.977
focused in Mesopotamia, sort of looked at us

170
00:06:50.977 --> 00:06:54.038
as a labor force, okay?

171
00:06:54.038 --> 00:06:55.877
They weren't necessarily cruel to us,

172
00:06:55.877 --> 00:06:57.857
but they weren't highly compassionate

173
00:06:57.857 --> 00:06:59.776
or spiritually evolved.

174
00:06:59.776 --> 00:07:01.396
And of course, just like human beings,

175
00:07:01.396 --> 00:07:03.517
there's a great range within the Anunnaki,

176
00:07:03.517 --> 00:07:05.777
from people who just basically trying to

177
00:07:05.777 --> 00:07:08.117
meet their own objectives and others,

178
00:07:08.117 --> 00:07:11.157
who are much more compassionately based.

179
00:07:11.157 --> 00:07:14.597
The House of Enki was primarily focused in Africa.

180
00:07:14.597 --> 00:07:16.997
And Enki had, Enki was known in Egypt as

181
00:07:16.997 --> 00:07:19.737
Ptah, or the father of humanity,

182
00:07:19.737 --> 00:07:21.077
the master builder.

183
00:07:21.077 --> 00:07:23.377
He had six sons and among them the eldest

184
00:07:23.377 --> 00:07:25.657
was Marduk, or Ra.

185
00:07:25.657 --> 00:07:26.837
He became known as Ra.

186
00:07:26.837 --> 00:07:27.917
And then there was Thoth,

187
00:07:27.917 --> 00:07:30.657
and Thoth, of course, became a master initiate.

188
00:07:30.657 --> 00:07:34.277
This was a much more spiritually and philosophically

189
00:07:34.277 --> 00:07:38.157
enlightened group of Annunaki.

190
00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:40.357
In fact, Thoth said of human beings,

191
00:07:40.357 --> 00:07:43.877
"Ye are gods going about in the bodies of mortals,

192
00:07:43.877 --> 00:07:47.737
"and we are gods who are souls who are in much

193
00:07:47.737 --> 00:07:49.697
"more immortal bodies."

194
00:07:49.697 --> 00:07:53.198
So, he recognized that the divinity that exists within them,

195
00:07:53.198 --> 00:07:57.617
also exists within us and that particular lineage became

196
00:07:57.617 --> 00:08:02.617
Thoth, Horus, Osiris, Isis,

197
00:08:03.517 --> 00:08:07.217
were really the christed energy of their day

198
00:08:07.217 --> 00:08:09.337
and they set up the great mystery schools

199
00:08:09.337 --> 00:08:11.917
all over the planet for the spiritual awakening

200
00:08:11.917 --> 00:08:13.917
and enlightening of the human race .

201
00:08:13.917 --> 00:08:15.617
<v Regina>It's interesting to hear you,</v>

202
00:08:15.617 --> 00:08:17.557
through your own mystical understandings,

203
00:08:17.557 --> 00:08:20.497
as well as what you've learned and gleaned from the outside,

204
00:08:20.497 --> 00:08:22.997
people are coming to similar places now,

205
00:08:22.997 --> 00:08:25.737
which creates a little different story.

206
00:08:25.737 --> 00:08:27.397
<v ->It's a very different story.</v>

207
00:08:27.397 --> 00:08:29.777
You know, I think one of the challenges with people

208
00:08:29.777 --> 00:08:32.457
who say, for example, with David Icke's work,

209
00:08:32.457 --> 00:08:35.197
is that because David Icke came upon the whole

210
00:08:35.197 --> 00:08:37.517
reptilian shape-shifting phenomena,

211
00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:40.637
and there are reptilians who can shape-shift--

212
00:08:40.637 --> 00:08:41.777
<v Regina>Yes. Absolutely.</v>

213
00:08:41.777 --> 00:08:43.673
<v ->And some of them are very selfish and</v>

214
00:08:43.673 --> 00:08:46.813
sex and power and money and control driven,

215
00:08:46.813 --> 00:08:49.813
and some of them are more evolved, okay?

216
00:08:49.813 --> 00:08:54.213
He superimposed the reptilians over the Annunaki gods.

217
00:08:54.213 --> 00:08:57.233
The Annunaki gods are not reptilians at all.

218
00:08:57.233 --> 00:08:58.212
Not at all.

219
00:08:58.212 --> 00:09:00.733
There's thousands of depictions of them and they're human.

220
00:09:00.733 --> 00:09:04.734
The only one that even has a remote similarity is because,

221
00:09:04.734 --> 00:09:08.912
Enki, the house of Enki, they were geneticists and

222
00:09:08.912 --> 00:09:13.572
one of the terms for "scientist" came to be a serpent.

223
00:09:13.572 --> 00:09:17.572
Just like you'd have a one-star general and a two-star?

224
00:09:17.572 --> 00:09:19.172
They would have the one-eyed serpent or the two-eyed

225
00:09:19.172 --> 00:09:21.793
as a designation of a scientist.

226
00:09:21.793 --> 00:09:23.812
They didn't even have snakes on their planet.

227
00:09:23.812 --> 00:09:25.112
They were fascinated by snakes when they came here

228
00:09:25.112 --> 00:09:27.092
because they didn't have anything similar.

229
00:09:27.092 --> 00:09:30.853
Of course, we can't help but notice that the snake

230
00:09:30.853 --> 00:09:32.892
is very similar to the movement of the kundalini,

231
00:09:32.892 --> 00:09:34.272
the movement up the spine,

232
00:09:34.272 --> 00:09:37.472
with the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems,

233
00:09:37.472 --> 00:09:40.572
and also the DNA and they were, as geneticists,

234
00:09:40.572 --> 00:09:44.872
they were very aware that there are certain genetic codes

235
00:09:44.872 --> 00:09:46.913
within our DNA that by being turned on,

236
00:09:46.913 --> 00:09:49.813
allow us the ability to procreate,

237
00:09:49.813 --> 00:09:53.632
the ability to access our spiritual and co-creative

238
00:09:53.632 --> 00:09:55.553
power with the divine.

239
00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:58.632
So, consequently, unfortunately although I think

240
00:09:58.632 --> 00:10:01.732
David's probably a really nice guy and working

241
00:10:01.732 --> 00:10:04.152
as fast as he can to try to get to a higher level of truth--

242
00:10:04.152 --> 00:10:04.872
<v Regina>Well, he is.</v>

243
00:10:04.872 --> 00:10:06.472
I know him really well and he's actually going to some

244
00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:07.793
really beautiful places now.

245
00:10:07.793 --> 00:10:09.653
<v ->I'm looking forward to someday having</v>

246
00:10:09.653 --> 00:10:12.492
a conversation with him but I think that,

247
00:10:12.492 --> 00:10:15.212
unfortunately for a lot of people who aren't--

248
00:10:15.212 --> 00:10:18.742
who don't have a direct experience with Annunaki,

249
00:10:18.742 --> 00:10:20.942
haven't really done their research or are not maybe

250
00:10:20.942 --> 00:10:24.963
as discerning when you have a very charismatic person

251
00:10:24.963 --> 00:10:27.382
standing up there, showing you lots of evidence

252
00:10:27.382 --> 00:10:29.502
and trying to put the puzzle together,

253
00:10:29.502 --> 00:10:31.682
unfortunately not quite correctly,

254
00:10:31.682 --> 00:10:34.163
it can be a little bit misleading.

255
00:10:34.163 --> 00:10:37.342
So, I'm really glad that's all being resolved now.

256
00:10:37.342 --> 00:10:38.382
<v Regina>Yeah, I think it is.</v>

257
00:10:38.382 --> 00:10:40.263
Everything seems to be going to a higher level.

258
00:10:40.263 --> 00:10:44.058
And not just David's work, many people's work at this time.

259
00:10:44.058 --> 00:10:45.617
<v ->That's so exciting.</v>

260
00:10:45.617 --> 00:10:46.677
<v Regina>It is.</v>

261
00:10:46.677 --> 00:10:47.878
Now, let's go back.

262
00:10:47.878 --> 00:10:51.238
You were talking about the gods that show up

263
00:10:51.238 --> 00:10:53.117
through the Egyptian times.

264
00:10:53.117 --> 00:10:55.757
We were speaking of Toth, or Thoth,

265
00:10:55.757 --> 00:10:59.737
and Horus and we're looking at the incarnate

266
00:10:59.737 --> 00:11:03.037
versions of this, which you're talking about

267
00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:06.197
Thoth and Hermes, for example.

268
00:11:06.197 --> 00:11:09.257
Then, going into the studies of the Hermetica,

269
00:11:09.257 --> 00:11:11.677
which seems to be very cloaked in secrecy.

270
00:11:11.677 --> 00:11:14.424
Not very many people really understand what

271
00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:16.964
the Hermetica is about, yet we'll see,

272
00:11:16.964 --> 00:11:18.624
anyone who reads this kind of information

273
00:11:18.624 --> 00:11:20.764
will start seeing the word popping up here and there.

274
00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:23.604
So, let's talk about your understanding of what

275
00:11:23.604 --> 00:11:24.904
Thoth passed through--

276
00:11:24.904 --> 00:11:27.164
Thoth-slash-Hermes--

277
00:11:27.164 --> 00:11:29.944
passed through as a scribe for us to

278
00:11:29.944 --> 00:11:32.344
reawaken to at this time?

279
00:11:32.344 --> 00:11:36.324
<v ->Well, Thoth was 100 years after Jesus.</v>

280
00:11:36.324 --> 00:11:39.305
The Library of Alexandria, the early church father,

281
00:11:39.305 --> 00:11:42.584
Clement of Alexandria, said that there were forty-two books

282
00:11:42.584 --> 00:11:45.244
that had been written by Thoth that were in the

283
00:11:45.244 --> 00:11:46.884
Library of Alexandria that contained

284
00:11:46.884 --> 00:11:48.604
all the wisdom of the world.

285
00:11:48.604 --> 00:11:52.504
Astronomy, Astrology, Law, Sacred Geometry,

286
00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:56.244
Mathmatics, Architecture, Language,

287
00:11:56.244 --> 00:11:57.445
Healing, Herbs.

288
00:11:57.445 --> 00:11:59.324
Everything you could possibly imagine.

289
00:11:59.324 --> 00:12:01.164
Unfortunately, of course, those were destroyed in

290
00:12:01.164 --> 00:12:03.364
the burning of the library.

291
00:12:03.364 --> 00:12:05.585
At least, we presume, unless they've gone underground.

292
00:12:05.585 --> 00:12:06.704
<v Regina>Well, some people have said they may</v>

293
00:12:06.704 --> 00:12:08.964
have been confiscated by what became the Catholic church.

294
00:12:08.964 --> 00:12:10.604
Some of those same interests.

295
00:12:10.604 --> 00:12:11.784
<v ->Yes, that's very interesting.</v>

296
00:12:11.784 --> 00:12:13.264
Well, it would be wonderful to find out

297
00:12:13.264 --> 00:12:15.144
that they still existed.

298
00:12:15.144 --> 00:12:18.984
But, Thoth, his real name was Ningishzidda.

299
00:12:18.984 --> 00:12:22.404
He was known as Tehuti, which comes from

300
00:12:22.404 --> 00:12:26.663
two derivatives which are the moon and the ibis bird.

301
00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:30.663
The Hermetic symbols that these Annunaki gods chose

302
00:12:30.663 --> 00:12:35.658
to represent the gift of wisdom that they each epitomized

303
00:12:35.658 --> 00:12:37.218
was very, very important.

304
00:12:37.218 --> 00:12:40.218
The ibis, for example, has a curved beak,

305
00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:43.658
but most of us don't know that there was

306
00:12:43.658 --> 00:12:46.218
an invasion of small flying snakes.

307
00:12:46.218 --> 00:12:48.758
Herodotus speaks of this in 450 B.C.

308
00:12:48.758 --> 00:12:50.298
in his famous histories.

309
00:12:50.298 --> 00:12:52.658
There was an invasion of small flying snakes

310
00:12:52.658 --> 00:12:55.078
that came into Egypt every year and it was

311
00:12:55.078 --> 00:12:58.278
the ibis bird that literally captured and killed them,

312
00:12:58.278 --> 00:12:59.838
so it was literally against the law

313
00:12:59.838 --> 00:13:02.678
to kill an ibis bird in ancient Egypt, okay?

314
00:13:02.678 --> 00:13:03.458
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>

315
00:13:03.458 --> 00:13:05.638
<v ->So, they were protectors of the people.</v>

316
00:13:05.638 --> 00:13:07.738
And, of course, the great feathered serpent.

317
00:13:07.738 --> 00:13:11.958
Thoth in his Quetzelcoatl form, was the raising

318
00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:15.378
of the kundalini that frees the consciousness from the body

319
00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:18.538
and allows us to travel outside of it in soul travel.

320
00:13:18.538 --> 00:13:20.638
Thoth was a master initiate and of course,

321
00:13:20.638 --> 00:13:23.659
over the course of thousands and thousands of years,

322
00:13:23.659 --> 00:13:26.938
part of which, for example, he worked with his brother Ra

323
00:13:26.938 --> 00:13:29.558
in establishing the civilization of Egypt.

324
00:13:29.558 --> 00:13:32.859
Later, when Ra was in exile for a while,

325
00:13:32.859 --> 00:13:36.358
Thoth actually ruled Egypt and then when Ra came back,

326
00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:38.878
they worked together for about 450 years,

327
00:13:38.878 --> 00:13:42.618
but they had very different philosophies in terms

328
00:13:42.618 --> 00:13:45.038
of solar and lunar energy.

329
00:13:45.038 --> 00:13:47.318
Thoth was primarily focused on a lunar calendar,

330
00:13:47.318 --> 00:13:49.918
because he understood that the cycles of the moon

331
00:13:49.918 --> 00:13:52.118
pulled the minerals up, the plants and

332
00:13:52.118 --> 00:13:54.978
they affected moods and cycles of growth

333
00:13:54.978 --> 00:13:57.678
and consciousness here.

334
00:13:57.678 --> 00:14:00.738
Ra was very much focused on a solar calendar.

335
00:14:00.738 --> 00:14:03.918
So, eventually, Enki, their dad, said,

336
00:14:03.918 --> 00:14:05.398
"Listen, Thoth, why don't you just let

337
00:14:05.398 --> 00:14:07.538
"your brother have Egypt?"

338
00:14:07.538 --> 00:14:09.958
So, Thoth left and went to Atlantis

339
00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.818
and he ruled Atlantis for over a thousand years.

340
00:14:12.818 --> 00:14:16.338
We know there are four works that still remain

341
00:14:16.338 --> 00:14:18.218
that are connected with him.

342
00:14:18.218 --> 00:14:19.819
One is the Emerald Tablets,

343
00:14:19.819 --> 00:14:22.558
which were said to have been posted literally

344
00:14:22.558 --> 00:14:24.878
in front of the great temples in the center

345
00:14:24.878 --> 00:14:26.558
of the heart of Atlantis.

346
00:14:26.558 --> 00:14:30.858
The Emerald Tablets really are an initiate's journey

347
00:14:30.858 --> 00:14:33.078
down into--

348
00:14:33.078 --> 00:14:35.778
through the Universe and the multi-dimensional planes of God

349
00:14:35.778 --> 00:14:37.638
and also meeting, what he calls

350
00:14:37.638 --> 00:14:40.598
"The Dweller on the Threshold," which is the shadow

351
00:14:40.598 --> 00:14:44.298
that we must all eventually meet and transcend,

352
00:14:44.298 --> 00:14:47.358
the ego within the self.

353
00:14:47.358 --> 00:14:49.498
Other books are the Egyptian Book of the Dead.

354
00:14:49.498 --> 00:14:54.498
He, as a master initiate who traveled through these

355
00:14:54.538 --> 00:14:56.358
gates of consciousness,

356
00:14:56.358 --> 00:14:59.158
described how when the soul leaves the body,

357
00:14:59.158 --> 00:15:02.958
it has to actually address this shadow area and

358
00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:07.238
this was epitomized in the symbol of Apophis.

359
00:15:07.238 --> 00:15:10.018
Apophis was the many-headed serpent.

360
00:15:10.018 --> 00:15:12.898
Lust, anger, greed, addiction, vanity,

361
00:15:12.898 --> 00:15:15.318
all of these forms and we had to slay,

362
00:15:15.318 --> 00:15:17.498
or defeat Apophis and if we didn't?

363
00:15:17.498 --> 00:15:19.398
Guess what? We reincarnated.

364
00:15:19.398 --> 00:15:21.638
If we managed to, we had an opportunity

365
00:15:21.638 --> 00:15:23.958
to literally pass through what they called the

366
00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.378
"Ring-Pass-Nots" or the gateways which

367
00:15:26.378 --> 00:15:30.278
were represented by the orbital planes

368
00:15:30.278 --> 00:15:32.098
of each of the planets.

369
00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:35.718
These planets are connected with the archetypes

370
00:15:35.718 --> 00:15:39.878
that dwell within us and also live within our solar system.

371
00:15:39.878 --> 00:15:44.038
If you had the right, let us say, vibrational frequency

372
00:15:44.038 --> 00:15:46.178
to be able to have integrated

373
00:15:46.178 --> 00:15:48.098
that archetype within yourself,

374
00:15:48.098 --> 00:15:49.638
then you pass through them.

375
00:15:49.638 --> 00:15:52.818
This is all connected with the Kabbalistic Tree of Life.

376
00:15:52.818 --> 00:15:56.198
So, of course in later centuries,

377
00:15:56.198 --> 00:15:58.318
the Egyptian Book of the Dead,

378
00:15:58.318 --> 00:16:03.318
also the Perum Hadu, or the House of Hadu,

379
00:16:03.318 --> 00:16:05.858
which is the higher name for Horus,

380
00:16:05.858 --> 00:16:08.278
the divine father energy.

381
00:16:08.278 --> 00:16:10.458
Although he incarnated as the divine son,

382
00:16:10.458 --> 00:16:13.518
the Christ energy many thousands of years ago,

383
00:16:13.518 --> 00:16:15.677
but was one of the four great kumars,

384
00:16:15.677 --> 00:16:17.278
Thoth, Horus, Jesus.

385
00:16:17.278 --> 00:16:20.058
These are three of the four.

386
00:16:20.058 --> 00:16:22.898
In future centuries, the priest of course,

387
00:16:22.898 --> 00:16:24.098
did many different versions.

388
00:16:24.098 --> 00:16:25.958
There were literally three different versions

389
00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.658
of the Egyptian Book of the Dead.

390
00:16:27.658 --> 00:16:29.258
So, today, most of us don't understand

391
00:16:29.258 --> 00:16:30.658
anything about what it means or

392
00:16:30.658 --> 00:16:31.938
how it's connected.

393
00:16:31.938 --> 00:16:34.158
The Hermetica is a third book.

394
00:16:34.158 --> 00:16:36.078
What we have as the Hermetica

395
00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:40.859
supposedly was created around 200 B.C.

396
00:16:40.859 --> 00:16:44.338
from the original writings and teachings of Thoth

397
00:16:44.338 --> 00:16:47.498
and so while part of it may have been penned

398
00:16:47.498 --> 00:16:49.677
but Thoth long ago,

399
00:16:49.677 --> 00:16:53.438
we have no way of knowing if it's exactly all of his words

400
00:16:53.438 --> 00:16:57.218
or not but certainly it vibrates with his frequency

401
00:16:57.218 --> 00:16:58.618
and it's very beautiful.

402
00:16:58.618 --> 00:17:00.139
Then, you have the Kybalion.

403
00:17:00.139 --> 00:17:03.038
The Kybalion are the seven hermetic principles

404
00:17:03.038 --> 00:17:04.918
that underly the Universe.

405
00:17:04.918 --> 00:17:08.278
The first one, of course, being that the Universe is mental,

406
00:17:08.278 --> 00:17:10.978
meaning that it responds to thoughts and emotions.

407
00:17:10.978 --> 00:17:13.019
This is what the best-selling book,

408
00:17:13.019 --> 00:17:14.758
"The Secret" was based on,

409
00:17:14.758 --> 00:17:18.318
his very first primal law.

410
00:17:18.318 --> 00:17:21.178
The other laws are things like the Universe,

411
00:17:21.178 --> 00:17:22.978
as long as we are in the lower worlds,

412
00:17:22.978 --> 00:17:24.238
operates through polarity.

413
00:17:24.238 --> 00:17:25.179
We have male and female,

414
00:17:25.179 --> 00:17:26.338
dark and light,

415
00:17:26.338 --> 00:17:27.639
high and low.

416
00:17:27.639 --> 00:17:31.498
That everything operates through rhythm.

417
00:17:31.498 --> 00:17:34.698
That there are biocycles, if you will,

418
00:17:34.698 --> 00:17:38.778
in every aspect of life from winter to summer.

419
00:17:38.778 --> 00:17:42.818
Another aspect is that everything is vibration,

420
00:17:42.818 --> 00:17:45.918
that all of the planes vibrate at different frequencies

421
00:17:45.918 --> 00:17:48.738
and this is how we're able to interact with one another

422
00:17:48.738 --> 00:17:50.678
because we're sort of vibrating in the same plane

423
00:17:50.678 --> 00:17:52.358
and we can see each other.

424
00:17:52.358 --> 00:17:55.118
So, you know, Thoth was a master of masters,

425
00:17:55.118 --> 00:17:57.818
as Jesus was and Jesus, of course,

426
00:17:57.818 --> 00:17:59.378
as you know from my book about

427
00:17:59.378 --> 00:18:01.018
Jesus and the great mysteries,

428
00:18:01.018 --> 00:18:05.098
was really trained in the mysteries of everything,

429
00:18:05.098 --> 00:18:09.098
from the great white brotherhood chapters of the Essenes,

430
00:18:09.098 --> 00:18:11.578
the Druids, the Mythrin priests, the Buddhist priests,

431
00:18:11.578 --> 00:18:14.074
the Brahmin priests and seven years in the

432
00:18:14.074 --> 00:18:19.074
Temples of Heliopolis, the City of the Sun in Ancient Egypt.

433
00:18:19.215 --> 00:18:21.695
<v Regina>Somehow, modern day Christianity has</v>

434
00:18:21.695 --> 00:18:24.475
seemed to miss virtually every message

435
00:18:24.475 --> 00:18:25.835
that was passed through.

436
00:18:25.835 --> 00:18:27.155
(laughing)

437
00:18:27.155 --> 00:18:32.155
It's fascinating that so much of the incredible work

438
00:18:32.735 --> 00:18:35.175
that's been passed through the ages has not

439
00:18:35.175 --> 00:18:38.415
been adopted nor have we adapted to it.

440
00:18:38.415 --> 00:18:40.414
It has not been adopted into modern day life.

441
00:18:40.414 --> 00:18:42.054
But, that's what this period is all about.

442
00:18:42.054 --> 00:18:44.175
So, and I find it fascinating that it's all coming

443
00:18:44.175 --> 00:18:47.639
back up again for our review and to embrace

444
00:18:47.639 --> 00:18:51.820
or to reject, so let's talk about the influence of,

445
00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:55.420
as you say, the Christed beings of

446
00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:59.740
Thoth and Jesus and who did you say?

447
00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:00.840
<v ->Horus.</v>

448
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.359
<v Regina>Horus, right.</v>

449
00:19:02.359 --> 00:19:04.419
Let's talk about their influence today.

450
00:19:04.419 --> 00:19:06.759
How do you perceive their influence on

451
00:19:06.759 --> 00:19:08.959
the planet today?

452
00:19:08.959 --> 00:19:13.220
<v ->Well, first let me just, if I can,</v>

453
00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.860
address the mysteries.

454
00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.940
The great spiritual mysteries of the past

455
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.340
which really in fact, taught that there was

456
00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.279
one divine intelligent principle,

457
00:19:23.279 --> 00:19:24.400
let us say "God,"

458
00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.620
behind everything that expresses itself in

459
00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.460
a multiplicity of forms.

460
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.920
Whether you look at it as humans,

461
00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.480
angels, archangels, divinities that, let us say,

462
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.719
serve at higher dimensional levels and

463
00:19:36.719 --> 00:19:38.999
those great mysteries were working for the

464
00:19:38.999 --> 00:19:41.679
enlightenment of the human race.

465
00:19:41.679 --> 00:19:44.939
These mysteries which were initially set up in the world,

466
00:19:44.939 --> 00:19:48.460
all over the world by Thoth, the great master Thoth.

467
00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.339
Whether it was the Druid path or the Egyptian path

468
00:19:52.339 --> 00:19:55.240
or the Mayan path, all of these really are fostered

469
00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.040
by the same divinities.

470
00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:02.040
These great spiritual mysteries really were

471
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:06.420
initiated by the four great Kumaras and

472
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.719
these Kumaras actually have secret names.

473
00:20:08.719 --> 00:20:11.779
So, if it's okay, I actually will bring forth

474
00:20:11.779 --> 00:20:13.140
these names now.

475
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:14.800
It's kind of a very big deal.

476
00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.600
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

477
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.120
<v ->I talk about them just a little bit in my book</v>

478
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.719
on Jesus and the mysteries.

479
00:20:18.719 --> 00:20:20.740
They are the head of the Great White Brotherhood,

480
00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.880
whose name was Sanat-Kumara.

481
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.720
Many people have heard of Sanat-Kumara.

482
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.900
I've only had one encounter with him.

483
00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.020
I have no idea whether or not he, himself,

484
00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.059
is actually incarnated here because he oversees

485
00:20:32.059 --> 00:20:35.660
the work of the great spiritual mystery schools

486
00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.820
on many, many planets, not just this one.

487
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:43.040
But, from the East, we could say that Jesus comes,

488
00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:48.040
or Sananda-Kumara, who I believe also incarnated

489
00:20:48.088 --> 00:20:52.748
as Osiris, because the profile is very similar.

490
00:20:52.748 --> 00:20:54.348
<v Regina>It is, yes.</v>

491
00:20:54.348 --> 00:20:55.448
<v ->He comes in, he helps humanity,</v>

492
00:20:55.448 --> 00:20:57.388
he travels the world helping humanity,

493
00:20:57.388 --> 00:20:59.048
he's taken out by the dark and then

494
00:20:59.048 --> 00:21:01.868
he is resurrected by the power of love.

495
00:21:01.868 --> 00:21:04.888
In Osiris' story, he's resurrected by the divine mother,

496
00:21:04.888 --> 00:21:06.528
who is expressed through Isis,

497
00:21:06.528 --> 00:21:09.208
the I-Am principle of the divine feminine.

498
00:21:09.208 --> 00:21:13.348
In Jesus' case, he's supported by Mary, his mother,

499
00:21:13.348 --> 00:21:15.769
and Mary Magdalene, his mate.

500
00:21:15.769 --> 00:21:19.949
Often, the solar lords are flanked by two female aspects,

501
00:21:19.949 --> 00:21:22.128
the mother and the mate,

502
00:21:22.128 --> 00:21:25.568
but, you know, he as he says literally in the New Testament,

503
00:21:25.568 --> 00:21:27.148
"No one takes my life from me,

504
00:21:27.148 --> 00:21:29.248
"I lay it down myself.

505
00:21:29.248 --> 00:21:31.588
"I take my life back willingly."

506
00:21:31.588 --> 00:21:32.448
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

507
00:21:32.448 --> 00:21:34.188
<v ->So he, actually, through the mastery of</v>

508
00:21:34.188 --> 00:21:37.548
nine energetic bodies in the temples of Ancient Egypt,

509
00:21:37.548 --> 00:21:42.548
he gained the spiritual technology and discipline

510
00:21:42.708 --> 00:21:46.568
and mastership within himself to literally lay down his body

511
00:21:46.568 --> 00:21:49.548
and then to take his life back again.

512
00:21:49.548 --> 00:21:52.988
So, a lot of times, you know, in modern days

513
00:21:52.988 --> 00:21:55.868
as we've finally begun to investigate Jesus

514
00:21:55.868 --> 00:21:58.788
and the mysteries, there's all sorts of speculation.

515
00:21:58.788 --> 00:22:02.448
"Oh, he had his twin brother killed instead of himself."

516
00:22:02.448 --> 00:22:04.829
"Oh, he didn't really die," or this or that.

517
00:22:04.829 --> 00:22:06.428
But, that's because we didn't really understand

518
00:22:06.428 --> 00:22:07.508
the spiritual technology.

519
00:22:07.508 --> 00:22:10.888
We've completely lost touch with these great mysteries

520
00:22:10.888 --> 00:22:13.868
and of course, part of my job on the planet today

521
00:22:13.868 --> 00:22:16.028
is to really bring them back.

522
00:22:16.028 --> 00:22:18.548
Then, we have in the South Gate,

523
00:22:18.548 --> 00:22:21.768
Sananthana or Sanandana, not Sananda,

524
00:22:21.768 --> 00:22:25.648
Sanandana or Sananthana as he is known,

525
00:22:25.648 --> 00:22:27.508
and this would be Horus.

526
00:22:27.508 --> 00:22:30.248
And this being incarnates the least often

527
00:22:30.248 --> 00:22:31.908
of all of them.

528
00:22:31.908 --> 00:22:33.888
He comes only in times of greatest darkness

529
00:22:33.888 --> 00:22:35.468
<v Regina>When there's a big epoch change.</v>

530
00:22:35.468 --> 00:22:36.488
<v ->Exactly.</v>

531
00:22:36.488 --> 00:22:38.928
When it looks like the dark is going to win.

532
00:22:38.928 --> 00:22:43.568
All of them are basically, they're healers,

533
00:22:43.568 --> 00:22:46.648
they're musicians, they're shepherds of the people.

534
00:22:46.648 --> 00:22:48.369
In fact, one of Osiris' --

535
00:22:48.369 --> 00:22:50.768
Jesus' names was the Good Shepherd.

536
00:22:50.768 --> 00:22:53.548
Osah. That was one of the things he was called.

537
00:22:53.548 --> 00:22:56.708
All the titles, by the way, literally transferred

538
00:22:56.708 --> 00:22:58.288
right over to Jesus.

539
00:22:58.288 --> 00:22:59.748
Not because I think Jesus stole them,

540
00:22:59.748 --> 00:23:01.788
but I think because they were the same being.

541
00:23:01.788 --> 00:23:05.788
With Sananthana, or Horus, I believe that he

542
00:23:05.788 --> 00:23:09.149
incarnated probably as Krishna and as Ramah,

543
00:23:09.149 --> 00:23:12.808
as well as Horus, because the M.O. is very similar.

544
00:23:12.808 --> 00:23:16.628
Basically, Horus was raised at a time of great darkness

545
00:23:16.628 --> 00:23:18.589
and chaos in Egypt,

546
00:23:18.589 --> 00:23:20.608
because his evil uncle Set, that had murdered

547
00:23:20.608 --> 00:23:22.589
his father, Osiris, had taken over

548
00:23:22.589 --> 00:23:25.728
and thrown the country into darkness.

549
00:23:25.728 --> 00:23:28.848
So, he had to raise an army, the Shim-shu-Hor,

550
00:23:28.848 --> 00:23:31.548
the followers of the way, of Horus,

551
00:23:31.548 --> 00:23:32.929
the way of truth.

552
00:23:32.929 --> 00:23:35.228
Just as Jesus called his path The Way,

553
00:23:35.228 --> 00:23:37.448
and Thoth called his path The Ancient Way,

554
00:23:37.448 --> 00:23:40.088
and Buddha called his path The Middle Way.

555
00:23:40.088 --> 00:23:42.428
Same conversation here.

556
00:23:42.428 --> 00:23:45.408
The Shim-shu-Hor, they actually spent 80 years

557
00:23:45.408 --> 00:23:49.928
battling Set and eventually won out and

558
00:23:49.928 --> 00:23:53.088
restored light, which is why later,

559
00:23:53.088 --> 00:23:55.668
when Horus was turned into the Greek god Apollo,

560
00:23:55.668 --> 00:23:57.568
you see image after image of him holding

561
00:23:57.568 --> 00:23:59.608
the torch of enlightenment.

562
00:23:59.608 --> 00:24:02.228
That's what the Greeks called Apollo.

563
00:24:02.228 --> 00:24:04.428
Finally, in the West, we have Thoth.

564
00:24:04.428 --> 00:24:07.528
The Western gate within the great medicine circle

565
00:24:07.528 --> 00:24:10.168
is always about the secrets and the mysteries.

566
00:24:10.168 --> 00:24:13.488
So, Thoth was the great bringer of

567
00:24:13.488 --> 00:24:15.468
the mystery schools down here.

568
00:24:15.468 --> 00:24:19.348
Jesus was, of course, a master initiate of all these paths.

569
00:24:19.348 --> 00:24:22.708
That is not to say that he was not a fully enlightened being

570
00:24:22.708 --> 00:24:24.808
when he came down but like all of us,

571
00:24:24.808 --> 00:24:28.488
he had a body that had to be fed and bathed

572
00:24:28.488 --> 00:24:31.368
and he had a mind that had to be coached and trained.

573
00:24:31.368 --> 00:24:34.488
Being exposed to something, he might get it immediately

574
00:24:34.488 --> 00:24:37.648
where it might take us ten thousand lifetimes to get it.

575
00:24:37.648 --> 00:24:42.608
He was able to implement those mystical abilities and

576
00:24:42.608 --> 00:24:47.608
access them through his own commitment to transformation.

577
00:24:48.968 --> 00:24:50.088
I mean, think about it.

578
00:24:50.088 --> 00:24:51.308
He spent his entire life--

579
00:24:51.308 --> 00:24:52.028
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

580
00:24:52.028 --> 00:24:55.288
<v ->learning to master those abilities.</v>

581
00:24:55.288 --> 00:24:58.008
<v Regina>Yes, thank you for that.</v>

582
00:24:58.008 --> 00:25:00.908
That's a wonderful prelude to going into

583
00:25:00.908 --> 00:25:02.948
what's happening today.

584
00:25:02.948 --> 00:25:03.588
<v ->Okay.</v>

585
00:25:03.588 --> 00:25:05.268
I guess that we're back to today.

586
00:25:05.268 --> 00:25:07.308
So, many people want to know,

587
00:25:07.308 --> 00:25:09.268
are the Annunaki coming back.

588
00:25:09.268 --> 00:25:11.329
That's like the $64,000 Question.

589
00:25:11.329 --> 00:25:14.048
Are the great masters coming back?

590
00:25:14.048 --> 00:25:15.329
What's happening?

591
00:25:15.329 --> 00:25:17.348
Certainly, we are at the end of an age.

592
00:25:17.348 --> 00:25:19.868
We are at the end of the fourth age of mankind.

593
00:25:19.868 --> 00:25:23.288
Traditionally, what happens at the end of an age,

594
00:25:23.288 --> 00:25:24.988
we go back and forth between what's called

595
00:25:24.988 --> 00:25:26.908
the "Summer" and the "Winter."

596
00:25:26.908 --> 00:25:29.648
In the Winter, we have the flood or the Ice Age,

597
00:25:29.648 --> 00:25:32.248
in the Summer, we have a solar mass ejection

598
00:25:32.248 --> 00:25:34.408
that comes out of the sun and basically

599
00:25:34.408 --> 00:25:36.389
wipes out a whole bunch of people, okay?

600
00:25:36.389 --> 00:25:38.008
And some of the planet.

601
00:25:38.008 --> 00:25:39.928
And there's a long period of regeneration

602
00:25:39.928 --> 00:25:42.948
and everything begins to come back.

603
00:25:42.948 --> 00:25:44.329
Since we had the flood,

604
00:25:44.329 --> 00:25:46.108
probably 11,500 years ago,

605
00:25:46.108 --> 00:25:48.808
what appears we may have this time,

606
00:25:48.808 --> 00:25:50.688
that would have been the Winter,

607
00:25:50.688 --> 00:25:51.808
we have the Summer coming.

608
00:25:51.808 --> 00:25:54.568
So, we're probably going to wind up having

609
00:25:54.568 --> 00:25:57.268
a pole shift and a solar mass ejection

610
00:25:57.268 --> 00:25:58.868
all about the same time.

611
00:25:58.868 --> 00:26:01.748
Will it really happen at the end of 2012?

612
00:26:01.748 --> 00:26:03.068
Who the heck knows?

613
00:26:03.068 --> 00:26:05.488
Maybe it will happen 2013,

614
00:26:05.488 --> 00:26:07.268
maybe it will happen 2017.

615
00:26:07.268 --> 00:26:09.948
Maybe it will happen in 2032.

616
00:26:09.948 --> 00:26:13.788
I think that when I look at the science

617
00:26:13.788 --> 00:26:16.068
behind where Nibiru is right now,

618
00:26:16.068 --> 00:26:19.468
if you were actually to go onto the internet

619
00:26:19.468 --> 00:26:23.568
and you looked under Nibiru, Planet X 2012,

620
00:26:23.568 --> 00:26:25.928
you will find some videos that were taken

621
00:26:25.928 --> 00:26:29.588
in April of 2009 and all the way through

622
00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:32.328
the summer of 2009 where Nibiru was

623
00:26:32.328 --> 00:26:35.028
on the far side of the sun and it could be seen,

624
00:26:35.028 --> 00:26:37.988
literally coming around behind the sun and

625
00:26:37.988 --> 00:26:39.969
separating from the sun.

626
00:26:39.969 --> 00:26:41.668
If you get a chance to see these videos,

627
00:26:41.668 --> 00:26:44.448
they're from a lot of places that look like

628
00:26:44.448 --> 00:26:46.268
Ukranian kind of language,

629
00:26:46.268 --> 00:26:48.568
more the southern hemisphere.

630
00:26:48.568 --> 00:26:50.088
They are mind-blowing and they will

631
00:26:50.088 --> 00:26:51.968
completely, you know,

632
00:26:51.968 --> 00:26:54.468
all of this stuff that seems like it's crazy theory

633
00:26:54.468 --> 00:26:55.748
and speculation,

634
00:26:55.748 --> 00:26:57.008
it will completely shift you into

635
00:26:57.008 --> 00:27:01.068
"Holy Toledo, this is really actually real."

636
00:27:01.068 --> 00:27:02.988
Because this body is so large,

637
00:27:02.988 --> 00:27:06.848
if the sun were a basketball,

638
00:27:06.848 --> 00:27:10.348
our planet is the size of a grain of rice.

639
00:27:10.348 --> 00:27:13.908
Nibiru appears to be about the size of a tangerine.

640
00:27:13.908 --> 00:27:16.628
That is a very, very large planet.

641
00:27:16.628 --> 00:27:19.529
And it's on the other side of the sun

642
00:27:19.529 --> 00:27:21.268
going around the asteroid belt.

643
00:27:21.268 --> 00:27:25.468
There is a point around February of 2013

644
00:27:25.468 --> 00:27:28.348
when, if we figured out the scientific orbital

645
00:27:28.348 --> 00:27:30.288
calculations correctly,

646
00:27:30.288 --> 00:27:33.468
our planet will come between Nibiru and the sun.

647
00:27:33.468 --> 00:27:37.408
At that point, it could scientifically draw

648
00:27:37.408 --> 00:27:41.948
a solar mass ejection from the sun towards our planet

649
00:27:41.948 --> 00:27:45.508
because of the size of the two bodies and we're the

650
00:27:45.508 --> 00:27:47.708
small grain of sand in between or

651
00:27:47.708 --> 00:27:49.748
the rice particle in between.

652
00:27:49.748 --> 00:27:54.488
So, that would be a critical time that could signal

653
00:27:54.488 --> 00:27:58.108
the point of a pole shift or a solar mass ejection.

654
00:27:58.108 --> 00:27:59.228
What can people do?

655
00:27:59.228 --> 00:28:01.088
People who are listening to this, that's a good question.

656
00:28:01.088 --> 00:28:03.068
I thought I heard that telepathically from you.

657
00:28:03.068 --> 00:28:04.308
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

658
00:28:04.308 --> 00:28:06.128
<v ->Well, in the first place, we have to remember that</v>

659
00:28:06.128 --> 00:28:07.908
we're all immortal, okay?

660
00:28:07.908 --> 00:28:10.108
We've had many, many lifetimes on this planet.

661
00:28:10.108 --> 00:28:13.028
If you die, you know you'll come back.

662
00:28:13.028 --> 00:28:15.908
The question is, for who is left down here,

663
00:28:15.908 --> 00:28:18.348
how can we prepare?

664
00:28:18.348 --> 00:28:20.888
Certainly caves are safe places.

665
00:28:20.888 --> 00:28:24.128
<v Regina>I've had dreams about this as well.</v>

666
00:28:24.128 --> 00:28:25.528
I agree with you, yes.

667
00:28:25.528 --> 00:28:26.788
<v ->That means fresh water.</v>

668
00:28:26.788 --> 00:28:28.108
That means tools.

669
00:28:28.108 --> 00:28:31.048
That means seeds that actually will regenerate and grow,

670
00:28:31.048 --> 00:28:33.328
not Monsanto Terminator seeds.

671
00:28:33.328 --> 00:28:34.269
<v Regina>Right.</v>

672
00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:35.848
<v ->That means clothes and blankets and things to</v>

673
00:28:35.848 --> 00:28:37.688
bear the temperature changes.

674
00:28:37.688 --> 00:28:40.989
It means oxygen filters, because there's going to be

675
00:28:40.989 --> 00:28:44.288
a lot of debris in the air for who knows?

676
00:28:44.288 --> 00:28:46.528
Maybe a year.

677
00:28:46.528 --> 00:28:50.288
Certainly, it has been said that the government

678
00:28:50.288 --> 00:28:54.168
has prepared over 128 underground facilities

679
00:28:54.168 --> 00:28:57.048
for themselves and their own military people.

680
00:28:57.048 --> 00:28:58.148
It is--

681
00:28:58.148 --> 00:28:59.868
although I am sure that there are a lot of good people

682
00:28:59.868 --> 00:29:00.868
among those people,

683
00:29:00.868 --> 00:29:03.488
it is a shame that that would be the consciousness

684
00:29:03.488 --> 00:29:05.208
of the people that would survive.

685
00:29:05.208 --> 00:29:08.228
Because, what we really want is a different society.

686
00:29:08.228 --> 00:29:10.588
We want a society that's not based on military

687
00:29:10.588 --> 00:29:14.048
might and war and power and greed

688
00:29:14.048 --> 00:29:15.768
and the hiding of secrets.

689
00:29:15.768 --> 00:29:18.268
What we want is an evolved society where

690
00:29:18.268 --> 00:29:20.848
human beings can live up to their full potential

691
00:29:20.848 --> 00:29:23.868
as spiritual light beings with compassion,

692
00:29:23.868 --> 00:29:26.548
love and sharing down here.

693
00:29:26.548 --> 00:29:28.588
So, whatever it is any of you who are listening

694
00:29:28.588 --> 00:29:29.968
to this might prepare,

695
00:29:29.968 --> 00:29:34.448
I would say prepare as if it was you and your family

696
00:29:34.448 --> 00:29:37.068
and many other people that you are going to save,

697
00:29:37.068 --> 00:29:39.788
but think about it from the point of view of,

698
00:29:39.788 --> 00:29:43.008
if you left and you left your children behind,

699
00:29:43.008 --> 00:29:48.008
what kind of books have perennial meaning?

700
00:29:48.028 --> 00:29:50.528
Spiritual books, philosophical books,

701
00:29:50.528 --> 00:29:52.328
but also technical books,

702
00:29:52.328 --> 00:29:57.328
books with how-to information so that your children

703
00:29:58.048 --> 00:30:00.968
could start over and we could create a society

704
00:30:00.968 --> 00:30:03.948
that is loving and kind and nourishing to

705
00:30:03.948 --> 00:30:07.188
both a physical, spiritual, emotional, mental self.

706
00:30:07.188 --> 00:30:09.208
<v Regina>My understanding of it is,</v>

707
00:30:09.208 --> 00:30:10.608
and we're seeing evidence of it already

708
00:30:10.608 --> 00:30:13.368
with ourselves and also with a lot of

709
00:30:13.368 --> 00:30:16.129
the younger generation and the new little beings

710
00:30:16.129 --> 00:30:17.608
being born right now,

711
00:30:17.608 --> 00:30:20.028
is access to knowledge.

712
00:30:20.028 --> 00:30:21.728
So, yes, I agree.

713
00:30:21.728 --> 00:30:25.268
Let's help each other out and have the books.

714
00:30:25.268 --> 00:30:27.808
However, because our consciousness has expanded

715
00:30:27.808 --> 00:30:30.388
and we are able to access on different levels,

716
00:30:30.388 --> 00:30:32.348
especially the newer ones,

717
00:30:32.348 --> 00:30:35.268
little ones coming in with more activated DNA,

718
00:30:35.268 --> 00:30:37.728
a more direct connection with themselves,

719
00:30:37.728 --> 00:30:40.228
I think that we don't have to look at this

720
00:30:40.228 --> 00:30:42.168
as being blasted back to the Stone Age if

721
00:30:42.168 --> 00:30:45.168
these changes are indeed going to occur.

722
00:30:45.168 --> 00:30:47.009
We just interviewed David Sereda,

723
00:30:47.009 --> 00:30:50.908
and he's talking about what's happening right now

724
00:30:50.908 --> 00:30:55.148
on a cellular level in connection with our own consciousness

725
00:30:55.148 --> 00:30:58.668
to be able to withstand these intense solar blasts.

726
00:30:58.668 --> 00:31:01.088
The cells can adapt in the body,

727
00:31:01.088 --> 00:31:04.129
so this is an interesting piece of what

728
00:31:04.129 --> 00:31:05.188
you're talking about.

729
00:31:05.188 --> 00:31:09.548
We are actually adapting to this potential right now.

730
00:31:09.548 --> 00:31:12.009
<v ->Let me say, many years ago,</v>

731
00:31:12.009 --> 00:31:13.708
probably 8 or 10 years ago,

732
00:31:13.708 --> 00:31:17.528
I was taken into a closed-door UFO meeting

733
00:31:17.528 --> 00:31:19.608
at one of the conferences that I was speaking at.

734
00:31:19.608 --> 00:31:22.928
I was introduced to some very interesting material

735
00:31:22.928 --> 00:31:26.648
by a microbiologist who had worked for the government.

736
00:31:26.648 --> 00:31:30.168
He was hired to try to cure an illness for--

737
00:31:30.168 --> 00:31:31.728
he didn't even know what it was.

738
00:31:31.728 --> 00:31:33.368
It was some strange virus.

739
00:31:33.368 --> 00:31:34.888
Well, he wasn't making headway.

740
00:31:34.888 --> 00:31:36.308
Eventually, they suited him up,

741
00:31:36.308 --> 00:31:38.368
took him into a hermetically sealed room,

742
00:31:38.368 --> 00:31:41.488
up through the floor came a little E.T. dude.

743
00:31:41.488 --> 00:31:44.988
This little E.T. guy was totally telepathic.

744
00:31:44.988 --> 00:31:46.968
He had no vocal chords and,

745
00:31:46.968 --> 00:31:48.288
over a period of two years,

746
00:31:48.288 --> 00:31:51.708
this microbiologist worked with this little E.T. guy.

747
00:31:51.708 --> 00:31:56.248
What the E.T. guy basically told him and showed him

748
00:31:56.248 --> 00:31:59.988
was that he came from sixty thousand years in our future

749
00:31:59.988 --> 00:32:02.848
and that there was going to be a solar mass ejection event

750
00:32:02.848 --> 00:32:04.668
that would happen on this planet.

751
00:32:04.668 --> 00:32:07.268
About seventy percent of the planet would be wiped out

752
00:32:07.268 --> 00:32:09.388
and that the human race would split at that point.

753
00:32:09.388 --> 00:32:11.528
There would be a group that would go underground

754
00:32:11.528 --> 00:32:14.308
and that they eventually would become so scientific

755
00:32:14.308 --> 00:32:17.728
that they would basically begin to create themselves

756
00:32:17.728 --> 00:32:20.388
as the gray aliens that we see today.

757
00:32:20.388 --> 00:32:22.648
There would be a group that would stay on top of the planet

758
00:32:22.648 --> 00:32:26.228
who would receive the new solar vibrational frequencies

759
00:32:26.228 --> 00:32:28.168
that would be coming in and they would become

760
00:32:28.168 --> 00:32:33.168
highly evolved, spiritually telepathic human beings.

761
00:32:33.288 --> 00:32:34.968
<v Regina>There you go.</v>

762
00:32:34.968 --> 00:32:37.408
<v ->It's kind of like H.G. Wells,</v>

763
00:32:37.408 --> 00:32:41.148
what's the one where he goes forward in the future?

764
00:32:41.148 --> 00:32:42.488
The Time Machine.

765
00:32:42.488 --> 00:32:45.028
Where there's the Eloi and the other group.

766
00:32:45.028 --> 00:32:47.748
So, basically, this little gray dude was saying

767
00:32:47.748 --> 00:32:50.808
"The reason that we gray dudes have been coming back

768
00:32:50.808 --> 00:32:52.408
"from ten thousand,

769
00:32:52.408 --> 00:32:53.048
"twenty thousand,

770
00:32:53.048 --> 00:32:54.508
"forty thousand, sixty thousand years in the future,

771
00:32:54.508 --> 00:32:56.868
"is because we are the remnants of the ones that went

772
00:32:56.868 --> 00:33:01.868
"underground who genetically engineered ourselves

773
00:33:02.128 --> 00:33:04.808
"into a corner and we've moved to the

774
00:33:04.808 --> 00:33:07.168
"Zeta Reticuli system and the only hope

775
00:33:07.168 --> 00:33:09.788
"we have of getting back to where we started

776
00:33:09.788 --> 00:33:13.188
"was to come back to you all before this occurs.

777
00:33:13.188 --> 00:33:16.928
"Because the next group of human beings is going to take

778
00:33:16.928 --> 00:33:19.328
"such an evolutionary leap that we can't even

779
00:33:19.328 --> 00:33:21.288
"go backwards from there."

780
00:33:21.288 --> 00:33:24.168
So, the sun, in the great mysteries,

781
00:33:24.168 --> 00:33:28.908
the sun was honored as a visible symbol of illumination

782
00:33:28.908 --> 00:33:31.248
but it was also known that the frequencies that

783
00:33:31.248 --> 00:33:33.988
come through the sun program DNA.

784
00:33:33.988 --> 00:33:35.908
They program forming matter.

785
00:33:35.908 --> 00:33:36.708
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

786
00:33:36.708 --> 00:33:37.928
<v ->And this is of course, very exciting stuff.</v>

787
00:33:37.928 --> 00:33:39.208
<v Regina>This is what's happening now.</v>

788
00:33:39.208 --> 00:33:41.948
<v ->So, the new children being born now,</v>

789
00:33:41.948 --> 00:33:43.988
as these new frequencies are coming through,

790
00:33:43.988 --> 00:33:45.948
are increasingly psychic, telepathic,

791
00:33:45.948 --> 00:33:47.848
intuitive and sensitive.

792
00:33:47.848 --> 00:33:50.148
So, imagine on the other side of this change,

793
00:33:50.148 --> 00:33:53.408
the incredible evolutionary leap that all matter

794
00:33:53.408 --> 00:33:56.088
on this planet is going to wind up taking.

795
00:33:56.088 --> 00:33:57.348
<v Regina>It's exciting.</v>

796
00:33:57.348 --> 00:33:58.608
<v ->It's extremely exciting.</v>

797
00:33:58.608 --> 00:34:00.248
<v Regina>I mean, how many times have we</v>

798
00:34:00.248 --> 00:34:02.908
already passed out of the physical?

799
00:34:02.908 --> 00:34:04.048
<v ->Yes.</v>

800
00:34:04.048 --> 00:34:04.928
<v Regina>It's inevitable.</v>

801
00:34:04.928 --> 00:34:06.528
So, there's no need to be afraid.

802
00:34:06.528 --> 00:34:08.008
This is how I do it.

803
00:34:08.008 --> 00:34:10.028
We don't need to be afraid of a large event

804
00:34:10.028 --> 00:34:11.048
or a small event.

805
00:34:11.048 --> 00:34:12.608
Whether you're hit by a truck

806
00:34:12.608 --> 00:34:14.488
or whether an asteroid comes,

807
00:34:14.488 --> 00:34:15.888
it doesn't matter.

808
00:34:15.888 --> 00:34:18.128
Or whether it's a mass solar ejection,

809
00:34:18.128 --> 00:34:22.349
a coronal ejection, the point is we're headed up.

810
00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:25.188
<v ->We totally are and I think that one of the things</v>

811
00:34:25.188 --> 00:34:27.123
about the Annunaki,

812
00:34:27.123 --> 00:34:28.943
the return of the Annunaki,

813
00:34:28.943 --> 00:34:32.703
on one hand, they made a joint decision

814
00:34:32.703 --> 00:34:37.703
around 2100 B.C. to begin to withdraw

815
00:34:37.844 --> 00:34:40.743
their influence from the planet and this was

816
00:34:40.743 --> 00:34:42.403
for a variety of reasons.

817
00:34:42.403 --> 00:34:45.143
They themselves were a very lawful society

818
00:34:45.143 --> 00:34:48.563
but there was a war that took place between

819
00:34:48.563 --> 00:34:53.154
the oldest son of Enki, which was Morduk Ra,

820
00:34:53.154 --> 00:34:56.634
and the oldest son of Enlil, which was Ninhurta Jehovah.

821
00:34:56.634 --> 00:34:58.034
Okay?

822
00:34:58.034 --> 00:34:59.874
So you think Jove, Jehovah.

823
00:34:59.874 --> 00:35:03.254
Jehovah and Ashera, or Jove and Hera.

824
00:35:03.254 --> 00:35:04.594
Okay?

825
00:35:04.594 --> 00:35:05.955
And this created--

826
00:35:05.955 --> 00:35:08.694
they bombed part of the Sinai peninsula.

827
00:35:08.694 --> 00:35:11.234
That's of course that's why everyone is

828
00:35:11.234 --> 00:35:12.614
fighting over Jerusalem, it's because

829
00:35:12.614 --> 00:35:15.374
that's where the original space station was.

830
00:35:15.374 --> 00:35:16.694
You could actually see this bombing

831
00:35:16.694 --> 00:35:18.634
from the satellite photographs now,

832
00:35:18.634 --> 00:35:21.594
you can see a blackened area in the Sinai peninsula.

833
00:35:21.594 --> 00:35:26.594
So, because they let their own passions get the best of them

834
00:35:27.194 --> 00:35:31.574
after, what, four hundred thousand years down here,

835
00:35:31.574 --> 00:35:32.434
they said,

836
00:35:32.434 --> 00:35:35.474
"Oh, my gosh. For all the good we've done for humanity,

837
00:35:35.474 --> 00:35:38.494
"we just taught them the arts of war.

838
00:35:38.494 --> 00:35:40.434
"This isn't acceptable.

839
00:35:40.434 --> 00:35:42.494
"Let us leave them to their own destiny,

840
00:35:42.494 --> 00:35:46.434
"Let us withdraw because maybe we're not helping them."

841
00:35:46.434 --> 00:35:49.034
So, they begin then to go into places like

842
00:35:49.034 --> 00:35:51.574
Scotland and Ireland and became known as

843
00:35:51.574 --> 00:35:53.714
Tuatha De Danann, or the people of Danu,

844
00:35:53.714 --> 00:35:56.134
or Anu, okay?

845
00:35:56.134 --> 00:35:58.794
And they eventually withdrew into areas

846
00:35:58.794 --> 00:36:00.454
within the inner Earth and then,

847
00:36:00.454 --> 00:36:03.674
about 530 or 570 B.C.,

848
00:36:03.674 --> 00:36:05.894
most of them left the planet.

849
00:36:05.894 --> 00:36:08.074
I think they have maintained a presence

850
00:36:08.074 --> 00:36:09.694
with underground bases here.

851
00:36:09.694 --> 00:36:11.094
I know because I've been on ships since

852
00:36:11.094 --> 00:36:13.194
I was a little girl and I've actually been shown

853
00:36:13.194 --> 00:36:16.074
where a lot of those underground bases are.

854
00:36:16.074 --> 00:36:17.674
<v Regina>Even in the military.</v>

855
00:36:17.674 --> 00:36:20.334
Even Robert Dean, who I just adore.

856
00:36:20.334 --> 00:36:21.174
<v ->He's lovely.</v>

857
00:36:21.174 --> 00:36:22.594
<v Regina>He speaks about it as well, yes.</v>

858
00:36:22.594 --> 00:36:23.754
From all points of view.

859
00:36:23.754 --> 00:36:26.734
<v ->So yes, they have, they still have centers here,</v>

860
00:36:26.734 --> 00:36:29.034
but they have tried to withdraw their influence.

861
00:36:29.034 --> 00:36:31.614
However, they definitely know what's coming.

862
00:36:31.614 --> 00:36:34.054
They have much more advanced sciences than we do

863
00:36:34.054 --> 00:36:36.794
and I think it's going to be their intention,

864
00:36:36.794 --> 00:36:39.134
along with other members of the Galactic Council,

865
00:36:39.134 --> 00:36:43.875
to try to let us rescue or save as many people

866
00:36:43.875 --> 00:36:46.294
as they can when this even happens.

867
00:36:46.294 --> 00:36:48.494
So, I suspect there may be a million,

868
00:36:48.494 --> 00:36:50.034
two million, five million.

869
00:36:50.034 --> 00:36:51.234
I don't know.

870
00:36:51.234 --> 00:36:54.214
But, we are picking up shapes of ships

871
00:36:54.214 --> 00:36:58.314
that are at least a thousand miles in diameter

872
00:36:58.314 --> 00:36:59.574
and that is astonishing.

873
00:36:59.574 --> 00:37:01.274
<v Regina>Some of that's been seen on NASA,</v>

874
00:37:01.274 --> 00:37:04.474
on the transmissions from NASA that were hidden.

875
00:37:04.474 --> 00:37:05.414
<v ->Yes, NASA, exactly.</v>

876
00:37:05.414 --> 00:37:06.474
So, why are they bringing such big ships?

877
00:37:06.474 --> 00:37:08.914
Because they know this event is imminent.

878
00:37:08.914 --> 00:37:11.514
Now, how will this look from an Earth human point of view?

879
00:37:11.514 --> 00:37:13.655
Will we sort of be put to sleep?

880
00:37:13.655 --> 00:37:16.814
Will they then move forward in time through time travel?

881
00:37:16.814 --> 00:37:19.514
A thousand years in the future,

882
00:37:19.514 --> 00:37:20.814
when the Earth is regenerated,

883
00:37:20.814 --> 00:37:22.714
put us down and we get to start over?

884
00:37:22.714 --> 00:37:27.314
In that case, maybe your cave with your sack of goodies

885
00:37:27.314 --> 00:37:29.834
will all still be just sitting there for you,

886
00:37:29.834 --> 00:37:31.374
or maybe, after a thousand years,

887
00:37:31.374 --> 00:37:33.674
it will have decayed, you know?

888
00:37:33.674 --> 00:37:36.374
I think that they do love humanity.

889
00:37:36.374 --> 00:37:38.374
I think that they care a great deal about us

890
00:37:38.374 --> 00:37:42.314
and that they want us to grow up and

891
00:37:42.314 --> 00:37:45.814
to become spiritually mature enough to join

892
00:37:45.814 --> 00:37:47.894
the Galactic community.

893
00:37:47.894 --> 00:37:49.374
I think that they've been rooting for us

894
00:37:49.374 --> 00:37:53.974
for thousands of years and they are very much with us.

895
00:37:53.974 --> 00:37:57.234
We are their children, they are our parents.

896
00:37:57.234 --> 00:38:00.054
That's a very, very important thing for us to remember

897
00:38:00.054 --> 00:38:03.334
as we move forward into this next era with

898
00:38:03.334 --> 00:38:08.334
love and compassion for those who have come before us.

899
00:38:08.554 --> 00:38:10.094
<v Regina>And fearlessly.</v>

900
00:38:10.094 --> 00:38:12.212
<v ->Fearlessly.</v>

901
00:38:12.212 --> 00:38:13.137
<v Regina>Thank you, Tricia.</v>

902
00:38:13.137 --> 00:38:15.378
<v ->Oh, my pleasure.</v>

903
00:38:15.378 --> 00:38:16.106
<v ->Tricia's new book,</v>

is now available if you want to take a deeper look

906
00:38:21.886 --> 00:38:23.186
