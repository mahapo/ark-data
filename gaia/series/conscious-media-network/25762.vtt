1
00:00:00.743 --> 00:00:03.041
<v ->Dr. Leonard Horowitz was among the first</v>

2
00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:04.887
to sound the alarm about the negative impacts

3
00:00:04.887 --> 00:00:07.810
of vaccinations and the larger political picture

4
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.068
surrounding them.

5
00:00:09.068 --> 00:00:10.903
This lead him to the exploration

6
00:00:10.903 --> 00:00:13.650
of esotaric healing modalities to counter the effects

7
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.028
of the vaccines and other diseases.

8
00:00:16.028 --> 00:00:19.090
In his research, he discovered some cloaked information

9
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.754
regarding the power of music,

10
00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:21.959
not just to heal,

11
00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:23.111
but to harm.

12
00:00:23.111 --> 00:00:24.593
We spoke with him about this

13
00:00:24.593 --> 00:00:27.953
but not before we got an update on the H5N1 flu

14
00:00:27.953 --> 00:00:31.958
that's anticipated to sweep the globe this fall.

15
00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:37.000 line:15% 
(surreal techno music)

16
00:00:40.755 --> 00:00:43.204
Leonard, it's good to meet with you about this topic

17
00:00:43.204 --> 00:00:45.743
'cause it is a very auspicious time right now.

18
00:00:45.743 --> 00:00:47.925
As we're meeting at this conference,

19
00:00:47.925 --> 00:00:50.426
the Bilderberg Group is meeting in Spain.

20
00:00:50.426 --> 00:00:52.936
And I notice when I look through the roster

21
00:00:52.936 --> 00:00:54.397
of the attendees,

22
00:00:54.397 --> 00:00:56.434
and this is a subject very near and dear to your heart,

23
00:00:56.434 --> 00:00:58.870
you spent a tremendous amount of time and energy on,

24
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.051
is a man named Daniel Vasella.

25
00:01:02.301 --> 00:01:04.570
I believe he's the CEO of Novartis.

26
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.597
And Novartis is one of the companies awarded

27
00:01:06.597 --> 00:01:08.057
a very, very large contract

28
00:01:08.057 --> 00:01:10.014
after the last Bilderberg meeting

29
00:01:10.014 --> 00:01:12.532
for the new type

30
00:01:12.532 --> 00:01:16.095
of incubation processed flu vaccines

31
00:01:16.095 --> 00:01:18.505
that came out last year.

32
00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:23.122
In your talk yesterday, I just perked up when you said

33
00:01:23.204 --> 00:01:26.275
you're expecting there's gonna be an H5N1 released

34
00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:27.501
this year.

35
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:30.123
Just launch right in and tell us what's going on

36
00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:32.524
to your understanding.

37
00:01:32.524 --> 00:01:35.019
<v ->Well we're being set up for depopulation.</v>

38
00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:38.575
Essentially the goal as Bill Gates himself,

39
00:01:38.575 --> 00:01:41.102
before the TED conference last February,

40
00:01:41.102 --> 00:01:42.436
articulated,

41
00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:46.694
there's a specific targeting of about six billion people

42
00:01:46.694 --> 00:01:51.081
that need to be eliminated from a seven billion population.

43
00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:54.010
And that the vaccinations which he says he loves

44
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.313
is really a genocidal weapon,

45
00:01:56.313 --> 00:01:59.683
when you really begin to understand vaccinations have

46
00:01:59.683 --> 00:02:01.523
intoxicating ingredients.

47
00:02:01.523 --> 00:02:03.199
Heavy metals, mercury, aluminum,

48
00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:05.160
formaldehyde, formalin.

49
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.003
The active agents include the genetic material,

50
00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:10.128
flu viruses.

51
00:02:10.128 --> 00:02:12.348
In the case of H1N1,

52
00:02:12.348 --> 00:02:16.475
you're looking at live, active viruses that

53
00:02:16.475 --> 00:02:18.955
when people get vaccinated,

54
00:02:19.512 --> 00:02:23.420
they shed and the spread those live, active viruses.

55
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.129
And in this case of Novartis

56
00:02:26.257 --> 00:02:29.063
which acquired Novavax,

57
00:02:29.063 --> 00:02:31.686
which was the company that actually triggered

58
00:02:31.686 --> 00:02:33.532
my inquiry.

59
00:02:33.532 --> 00:02:36.113
Because I was reading press releases from

60
00:02:36.113 --> 00:02:38.545
the Novavax Corporation,

61
00:02:38.545 --> 00:02:42.569
having prepared combination vaccinations

62
00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.361
that included H1N1

63
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:47.261
and H5N1,

64
00:02:47.271 --> 00:02:50.763
and the H5N1 is a very, very deadly virus.

65
00:02:50.763 --> 00:02:54.355
It kills six out of ten people it infects.

66
00:02:54.355 --> 00:02:56.624
It's the worst kind of flu.

67
00:02:56.624 --> 00:03:00.283
The recombination in a vaccination

68
00:03:00.283 --> 00:03:03.233
of H1N1 with H5N1

69
00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:07.226
was what Novavax had actually come out with,

70
00:03:07.226 --> 00:03:11.370
saying that they had this vaccine just a couple weeks

71
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.072
before the press announced

72
00:03:15.072 --> 00:03:16.642
the emergence

73
00:03:16.642 --> 00:03:18.703
of the Mexican swine flu.

74
00:03:18.703 --> 00:03:19.828
<v ->Yes.</v>

75
00:03:19.828 --> 00:03:22.230
So this was April 2009.

76
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.961
<v ->Yes, and it was very interesting timing,</v>

77
00:03:24.961 --> 00:03:27.003
I tracked that and wrote a blog for anyone interested

78
00:03:27.003 --> 00:03:28.913
called, Big Pharma's Rock Stars.

79
00:03:28.913 --> 00:03:30.064
They can find that on our site.

80
00:03:30.064 --> 00:03:32.273
And it tracks this and the timing of all this,

81
00:03:32.273 --> 00:03:35.867
which is not just suspicious but stinky.

82
00:03:35.867 --> 00:03:37.233
<v ->Oh, it's horrible.</v>

83
00:03:37.233 --> 00:03:39.422
And highly incriminating.

84
00:03:39.482 --> 00:03:42.657
I actually was the first one to put up on Youtube,

85
00:03:42.657 --> 00:03:45.371
and you can go there right now if you do a search

86
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:49.916
on Mexican swine flu Dr. Horowitz special report.

87
00:03:49.916 --> 00:03:52.974
You'll see we have probably about 300,000 people

88
00:03:52.974 --> 00:03:54.476
who have viewed this,

89
00:03:54.476 --> 00:03:58.828
and it is the one that alerted us to the fact

90
00:03:58.828 --> 00:04:00.855
that this is a globalist agenda.

91
00:04:00.855 --> 00:04:03.255
The World Health Organization

92
00:04:03.255 --> 00:04:07.049
had actually paid and consulted

93
00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.399
with Dr. James Robertson,

94
00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:12.481
who with Dr. John Woods ran the laboratory,

95
00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:16.900
the influenza branch for the World Health Organization

96
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.201
in charge of selecting the viruses

97
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:22.168
that would be used

98
00:04:22.402 --> 00:04:24.129
in the near future.

99
00:04:24.265 --> 00:04:27.082
One of the most disturbing of all the revelations

100
00:04:27.082 --> 00:04:30.740
in reviewing this testimony that Dr. Robertson had given

101
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.066
to World Health Organization officials,

102
00:04:33.066 --> 00:04:36.099
is that he recommended in advance

103
00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.125
of a suspected emerging outbreak,

104
00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:43.449
that the populations would be vaccinated,

105
00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.349
or exposed,

106
00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:49.514
beforehand to a weaker type of strain

107
00:04:49.514 --> 00:04:51.454
to induce

108
00:04:51.454 --> 00:04:52.960
herd immunity.

109
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.523
<v ->Is that H1N1?</v>

110
00:04:54.523 --> 00:04:55.858
<v ->That's H1N1.</v>

111
00:04:55.858 --> 00:04:57.503
<v ->That happened last year.</v>

112
00:04:57.503 --> 00:04:58.711
<v ->Yes.</v>

113
00:04:58.723 --> 00:05:01.419
That's what the vaccinations really did.

114
00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.053
The H1N1 vaccinations

115
00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:07.313
actually spread H1N1

116
00:05:07.313 --> 00:05:10.135
and then created this

117
00:05:10.135 --> 00:05:12.275
then alleged immunity

118
00:05:12.275 --> 00:05:14.134
in the vaccinated populations,

119
00:05:14.134 --> 00:05:16.451
but not just the vaccinated populations

120
00:05:16.451 --> 00:05:19.469
because it spreads from vaccinated people

121
00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:21.433
to non-vaccinated people.

122
00:05:21.433 --> 00:05:25.653
Everyone was pretty much exposed to H1N1 already.

123
00:05:25.653 --> 00:05:28.767
So now the next step of course,

124
00:05:28.767 --> 00:05:32.724
is to recombine through some natural phenomenon,

125
00:05:32.724 --> 00:05:35.855
they would tell us, and they been telling us.

126
00:05:35.855 --> 00:05:37.096
From my understanding,

127
00:05:37.096 --> 00:05:41.240
currently there's two state public health agencies

128
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.754
in the United States that are already promoting,

129
00:05:43.754 --> 00:05:48.004
come get your vaccinations in advance of the potential

130
00:05:48.004 --> 00:05:51.974
of H5N1 recombining with H1N1,

131
00:05:51.974 --> 00:05:54.831
and that that's supposedly gonna be happening

132
00:05:54.831 --> 00:05:56.987
in the fall of 2010.

133
00:05:56.987 --> 00:05:59.642
So that's now within a few months.

134
00:05:59.642 --> 00:06:02.556
<v ->Leonard, last year my instinct was, we were being</v>

135
00:06:02.556 --> 00:06:04.465
set up with those vaccines,

136
00:06:04.465 --> 00:06:07.547
and interestingly they did not get the population

137
00:06:07.547 --> 00:06:09.792
on board to the degree that they had hoped they would

138
00:06:09.792 --> 00:06:10.909
voluntarily.

139
00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:12.018
Which we'll talk about that part later,

140
00:06:12.018 --> 00:06:14.289
but I just wanna go back to what we were originally

141
00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:15.206
talking about.

142
00:06:15.206 --> 00:06:17.948
Daniel Vasella promised his shareholders at Novartis

143
00:06:17.948 --> 00:06:21.564
that he was going to bring out a billion dollar winner

144
00:06:21.564 --> 00:06:23.721
for the shareholders.

145
00:06:24.511 --> 00:06:27.168
There's a huge motivation

146
00:06:27.704 --> 00:06:31.321
to release not only the virus, but the vaccine.

147
00:06:31.321 --> 00:06:32.656
Obviously, this is big money.

148
00:06:32.656 --> 00:06:34.223
Can you tell us what's going on?

149
00:06:34.223 --> 00:06:36.250
<v ->I think that that's extremely important</v>

150
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.668
and I would highly recommend that you get this

151
00:06:38.668 --> 00:06:41.493
information out as urgently and quickly as possible.

152
00:06:41.493 --> 00:06:44.806
Because understanding that Novavax

153
00:06:44.806 --> 00:06:47.003
was acquired by Novartis,

154
00:06:47.003 --> 00:06:51.943
so Daniel Vasella as CEO of Novartis

155
00:06:52.356 --> 00:06:56.844
has acquired the company that, as I mentioned,

156
00:06:56.844 --> 00:06:59.517
triggered my whole instinct like yours

157
00:06:59.517 --> 00:07:02.988
that something fishy was going on here.

158
00:07:02.988 --> 00:07:04.473
How could you have

159
00:07:04.473 --> 00:07:06.623
within a couple weeks of a press release saying

160
00:07:06.623 --> 00:07:10.868
that we have the H5N1 and the H1N1 vaccine

161
00:07:10.868 --> 00:07:13.870
available, proven effective,

162
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.204
and then you realize they were seeding H1N1,

163
00:07:18.204 --> 00:07:21.307
and that they're now telling us that H5N1

164
00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:23.473
was already circulating.

165
00:07:23.473 --> 00:07:26.678
You didn't need a rocket scientist to tell you that

166
00:07:26.678 --> 00:07:28.735
it was gonna be recombining.

167
00:07:28.735 --> 00:07:32.644
So they set it up to spread H1N1

168
00:07:32.644 --> 00:07:34.484
via the vaccinations,

169
00:07:34.484 --> 00:07:37.807
via the fright and the outbreak in Mexico,

170
00:07:37.807 --> 00:07:41.815
in a year in advance a marketing campaign,

171
00:07:41.815 --> 00:07:44.651
and a economic agenda

172
00:07:44.651 --> 00:07:47.161
that serves not only profit,

173
00:07:47.161 --> 00:07:48.975
but depopulation.

174
00:07:48.975 --> 00:07:52.446
Because ultimately they're looking forward to killing

175
00:07:52.446 --> 00:07:55.749
six out of seven people on this planet.

176
00:07:56.738 --> 00:07:58.567
<v ->That's under discussion right now.</v>

177
00:07:58.567 --> 00:08:00.989
These kinds of arrangements are being made

178
00:08:00.989 --> 00:08:02.948
at the Bilderberg meeting this weekend,

179
00:08:02.948 --> 00:08:04.597
and he is always strategically placed.

180
00:08:04.597 --> 00:08:06.570
He shows up there almost every year.

181
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.804
So not surprising when you start looking at the timing

182
00:08:08.804 --> 00:08:11.673
of the rollout of the awarding of these

183
00:08:11.673 --> 00:08:13.485
particular contracts.

184
00:08:13.485 --> 00:08:15.223
And Novartis is right up there.

185
00:08:15.223 --> 00:08:17.243
<v ->They're jumping on the spot,</v>

186
00:08:17.243 --> 00:08:19.509
ready to come forth with the new vaccine

187
00:08:19.509 --> 00:08:23.878
that's going to handle H5N1 recombinant with H1N1.

188
00:08:24.239 --> 00:08:27.390
<v ->You talked about also combining with natural factors,</v>

189
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:30.315
could one of these natural factors be (laughs) chemtrails

190
00:08:30.315 --> 00:08:33.690
that are being sprayed all over the NATO countries,

191
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.193
not just the US.

192
00:08:35.193 --> 00:08:37.381
<v ->I believe there's a substantial amount of evidence.</v>

193
00:08:37.381 --> 00:08:39.269
In fact there's a mountain of evidence

194
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:42.767
that clearly indicates that this chemtrail spraying

195
00:08:42.767 --> 00:08:45.914
that is literally causing people who who to have

196
00:08:45.914 --> 00:08:47.693
respiratory problems now,

197
00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:50.774
and we're seeing more and more of this internationally.

198
00:08:50.774 --> 00:08:54.410
That the aluminum and the barium

199
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.088
and the other chemicals that are in it,

200
00:08:57.088 --> 00:08:58.720
and we don't really have a complete list

201
00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.299
of all the chemicals in it.

202
00:09:00.299 --> 00:09:02.580
There's been researchers who've done a wonderful job

203
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.000
documenting it and investigating this intoxication.

204
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.793
Ultimately, it's for the same program,

205
00:09:09.793 --> 00:09:11.808
because what people don't understand,

206
00:09:11.808 --> 00:09:15.627
it's called the Russian Biological Cocktail method

207
00:09:15.627 --> 00:09:18.230
of conducting quote, non-lethal warfare.

208
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:22.497
It was termed the Russian Biological Cocktail method

209
00:09:22.497 --> 00:09:24.252
by the Americans.

210
00:09:24.252 --> 00:09:27.607
It's a form of exposing targeted populations

211
00:09:27.607 --> 00:09:31.285
to combinations of chemicals which wreak havoc

212
00:09:31.285 --> 00:09:33.032
with the human immune system,

213
00:09:33.032 --> 00:09:35.657
leaving people more susceptible to opportunistic

214
00:09:35.657 --> 00:09:37.561
infections then.

215
00:09:37.715 --> 00:09:39.763
And then the biologicals.

216
00:09:39.763 --> 00:09:43.293
So you weaken populations with chemtrail sprayings,

217
00:09:43.293 --> 00:09:45.075
with the aluminum, the formaldehyde,

218
00:09:45.075 --> 00:09:47.783
and the vaccinations are a typical example

219
00:09:47.783 --> 00:09:50.013
of what's called a Russian Biological Cocktail.

220
00:09:50.013 --> 00:09:51.944
It's a biological weapon.

221
00:09:51.944 --> 00:09:53.939
That's what a vaccination is.

222
00:09:53.939 --> 00:09:57.239
It has chemicals and biological, or genetic,

223
00:09:57.239 --> 00:09:59.505
and proteinaceous agents from bacteria,

224
00:09:59.505 --> 00:10:01.217
viruses, fungus.

225
00:10:01.217 --> 00:10:03.355
All of these agents, these infectious agents--

226
00:10:03.355 --> 00:10:06.887
<v ->That are all unrecognizable to the human immune system.</v>

227
00:10:06.887 --> 00:10:10.098
<v ->They would be recognizable if we were to be</v>

228
00:10:10.098 --> 00:10:12.115
receiving them through natural routes,

229
00:10:12.115 --> 00:10:13.883
such as oral routes.

230
00:10:13.883 --> 00:10:16.561
But the reality is with vaccinations,

231
00:10:16.561 --> 00:10:19.430
you're getting it injected directly into the bloodstream,

232
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:23.630
which actually is opposing to the natural way

233
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:25.606
that a human immune system has been,

234
00:10:25.606 --> 00:10:27.772
by the grace of the Creator, created.

235
00:10:27.772 --> 00:10:30.169
You have in the gut, for example,

236
00:10:30.169 --> 00:10:32.057
the Peyer's patches.

237
00:10:32.057 --> 00:10:34.724
The fundamental first line of defense

238
00:10:34.724 --> 00:10:37.235
once an agent gets into

239
00:10:37.692 --> 00:10:38.767
your gut,

240
00:10:38.767 --> 00:10:41.096
is essentially through the immune system of the gut

241
00:10:41.096 --> 00:10:44.148
which then alerts the rest of the immune system

242
00:10:44.148 --> 00:10:45.972
that it's been exposed to this agent.

243
00:10:45.972 --> 00:10:47.924
And that's fine, that's normal.

244
00:10:47.924 --> 00:10:50.569
People still could get sick but at least the immune system

245
00:10:50.569 --> 00:10:53.518
is now engaged in its normal process.

246
00:10:53.518 --> 00:10:55.562
And you have it injected

247
00:10:55.562 --> 00:10:57.499
mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde,

248
00:10:57.499 --> 00:11:01.071
formalin, MSG, polysorbate 80, Tween.

249
00:11:01.071 --> 00:11:03.220
You wouldn't be injecting these chemicals

250
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.107
into the bloodstream that actually weaken

251
00:11:05.107 --> 00:11:06.124
the immune system.

252
00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:08.610
And then with the new adjuvanted vaccinations

253
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:09.942
such as the H1N1,

254
00:11:09.942 --> 00:11:12.929
most of those vaccinations are containing these

255
00:11:12.929 --> 00:11:15.233
agents that they called adjuvants.

256
00:11:15.233 --> 00:11:18.815
Which include nonoxyl-9 spermicide,

257
00:11:18.815 --> 00:11:20.978
which has also been shown

258
00:11:20.978 --> 00:11:23.730
to be a mutagen.

259
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.795
It causes fetal abnormalities,

260
00:11:26.795 --> 00:11:28.501
it causes birth defects

261
00:11:28.501 --> 00:11:30.794
and spontaneous abortions.

262
00:11:30.794 --> 00:11:34.949
So right now, if you really did a sophisticated review

263
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:38.022
of even the Centers for Disease Control's own,

264
00:11:38.022 --> 00:11:39.973
what's called V-A-R-S studies,

265
00:11:39.973 --> 00:11:44.207
it's the Vaccine Adverse Event Report Survey.

266
00:11:44.207 --> 00:11:48.017
If you study that you realize they report

267
00:11:48.017 --> 00:11:50.012
hundreds and hundreds of women who had

268
00:11:50.012 --> 00:11:52.276
spontaneous abortions, miscarriages,

269
00:11:52.276 --> 00:11:54.870
following H1N1 vaccination.

270
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:59.335
But they only report about 10% of the actual miscarriages,

271
00:11:59.335 --> 00:12:03.442
so you gotta multiply their numbers by probably ninefold.

272
00:12:03.442 --> 00:12:05.856
Now you begin to see that you have had thousands

273
00:12:05.856 --> 00:12:08.304
of cases of spontaneous miscarriages following

274
00:12:08.304 --> 00:12:09.869
H1N1 vaccinations

275
00:12:09.869 --> 00:12:13.226
that the mainstream media has not even touched upon.

276
00:12:13.474 --> 00:12:17.036
Mainstream media in recent months,

277
00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:18.955
Sherri Kane, investigative journalist

278
00:12:18.955 --> 00:12:20.537
and a Fox News defector,

279
00:12:20.537 --> 00:12:24.171
has investigated the links between Big Pharma

280
00:12:24.171 --> 00:12:25.604
and the mainstream media.

281
00:12:25.604 --> 00:12:28.086
And exposed the mob bosses

282
00:12:28.086 --> 00:12:31.336
in charge of the drug cartel,

283
00:12:31.336 --> 00:12:33.969
the same people who are controlling the mainstream media.

284
00:12:33.969 --> 00:12:36.636
So they're not telling you what the real risks are,

285
00:12:36.636 --> 00:12:39.068
they're not telling you how many pregnant women

286
00:12:39.068 --> 00:12:41.403
are actually miscarrying because of the vaccinations,

287
00:12:41.403 --> 00:12:44.176
nor are they gonna tell you what's really happening.

288
00:12:44.176 --> 00:12:48.218
Which is this recombination scenario has been set up

289
00:12:48.218 --> 00:12:51.664
for them to have a mass killing, not only on Wall Street,

290
00:12:51.664 --> 00:12:53.429
because like you mentioned,

291
00:12:53.429 --> 00:12:55.390
Novartis' stocks are gonna soar

292
00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:56.975
when they have the Johnny-on-the-spot

293
00:12:56.975 --> 00:13:00.362
H5N1-H1N1 recombinant vaccination.

294
00:13:00.362 --> 00:13:03.797
Their billion dollars profit is assured,

295
00:13:03.797 --> 00:13:07.697
plus they have advanced the depopulation agenda.

296
00:13:07.697 --> 00:13:09.192
Making people sick

297
00:13:09.192 --> 00:13:12.112
and profiting not only off of humanity's suffering,

298
00:13:12.112 --> 00:13:16.560
but in the most exquisite and demonic way

299
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.503
to reduce populations most profitably.

300
00:13:20.503 --> 00:13:22.749
They have engineered in their labs

301
00:13:22.757 --> 00:13:24.614
and through the media.

302
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:29.406
<v ->Okay, well, that's rather dire, of course.</v>

303
00:13:32.001 --> 00:13:34.802
You said earlier that the H1N1,

304
00:13:34.802 --> 00:13:36.573
you didn't have to have the vaccine

305
00:13:36.573 --> 00:13:38.578
because you could actually expose one another.

306
00:13:38.578 --> 00:13:41.714
If anyone within your household or community had H1N1,

307
00:13:41.714 --> 00:13:43.125
you were automatically exposing--

308
00:13:43.125 --> 00:13:44.713
<v ->Very likely you were exposed, yeah.</v>

309
00:13:44.713 --> 00:13:46.610
<v ->So a very large part of the population</v>

310
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:50.754
in the NATO nations have been exposed to H1N1.

311
00:13:50.754 --> 00:13:53.731
Let's say the vaccine does the same thing.

312
00:13:53.731 --> 00:13:57.190
Let's say we have a low uptake on volunteerism

313
00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.931
to get H5N1.

314
00:13:59.931 --> 00:14:01.723
What happens with this scenario?

315
00:14:01.723 --> 00:14:04.810
If say it plays out similarly to last year.

316
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.145
Wasn't a huge percentage of the population that really

317
00:14:08.145 --> 00:14:11.591
upped for it because there was so much negative publicity.

318
00:14:11.781 --> 00:14:13.262
<v ->Well everything is set up right now</v>

319
00:14:13.262 --> 00:14:16.878
because of the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act

320
00:14:16.878 --> 00:14:19.032
to mandate vaccinations.

321
00:14:19.032 --> 00:14:21.528
In fact a lot of people are concerned as I am

322
00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:24.035
about the Census Bureau going house to house

323
00:14:24.035 --> 00:14:25.987
in the last many months

324
00:14:25.987 --> 00:14:29.064
to get absolute clarity as to who's living where.

325
00:14:29.064 --> 00:14:31.000
<v ->Which ethnicities in particular.</v>

326
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.651
<v ->Which ethnicities, exactly.</v>

327
00:14:32.651 --> 00:14:35.756
<v ->These viruses affect different ethnicities differently.</v>

328
00:14:35.756 --> 00:14:38.113
<v ->Exactly, there is higher predispositions</v>

329
00:14:38.113 --> 00:14:40.070
for various illnesses

330
00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:43.520
and susceptibility to diseases between races.

331
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.600
Now that's standard eugenics.

332
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.579
That's the old, old,

333
00:14:47.579 --> 00:14:50.875
before it was called genetics it was called really eugenics.

334
00:14:50.875 --> 00:14:53.441
So what we have is a combination

335
00:14:53.441 --> 00:14:56.289
of racial hygiene.

336
00:14:58.127 --> 00:15:01.445
In fact, eugenics is defined

337
00:15:01.445 --> 00:15:03.545
as the scientific investigation

338
00:15:03.545 --> 00:15:05.988
of genetic differences between the races,

339
00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:09.320
including the genetic predispositions for diseases

340
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.675
between the races.

341
00:15:10.675 --> 00:15:11.741
So yes, indeed.

342
00:15:11.741 --> 00:15:13.118
<v ->Now they have a really good profile</v>

343
00:15:13.118 --> 00:15:14.956
as of this 2010 census.

344
00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:17.008
<v ->They do, they have that.</v>

345
00:15:17.245 --> 00:15:20.456
The Model State Emergency Health Powers Act

346
00:15:20.456 --> 00:15:23.467
that has been enacted by most of the states,

347
00:15:23.752 --> 00:15:27.302
Barack Obama to my knowledge has never reversed

348
00:15:27.302 --> 00:15:29.235
the emergency

349
00:15:29.235 --> 00:15:31.238
with H1N1.

350
00:15:31.238 --> 00:15:35.495
And that then allowed legislatively,

351
00:15:35.495 --> 00:15:37.930
and according to statutory law

352
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.967
and the health department's administrative rules

353
00:15:40.967 --> 00:15:42.443
and regulations.

354
00:15:42.443 --> 00:15:46.158
Enabling the officials from the state,

355
00:15:46.158 --> 00:15:47.894
the public health officials,

356
00:15:47.894 --> 00:15:49.556
the director of public health of a state

357
00:15:49.556 --> 00:15:51.148
of let's say California,

358
00:15:51.148 --> 00:15:53.918
to mandate vaccinations

359
00:15:53.918 --> 00:15:56.408
for every man, woman, and child.

360
00:15:56.408 --> 00:16:00.269
That legislation is already established

361
00:16:00.269 --> 00:16:03.460
and my great concern is that

362
00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.340
most people will go along with this.

363
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.420
Everything is set in place to do so.

364
00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.864
<v ->Once it set in motion through the media</v>

365
00:16:10.864 --> 00:16:13.221
that we now have an emergency at hand.

366
00:16:13.221 --> 00:16:14.435
<v ->That we have an emergency</v>

367
00:16:14.435 --> 00:16:17.016
and all they have to do is loose out of the lab,

368
00:16:17.016 --> 00:16:20.046
just like they did with the anthrax fright.

369
00:16:20.046 --> 00:16:21.486
They mailed anthrax.

370
00:16:21.486 --> 00:16:24.247
Well gee whiz, didn't take again a rocket scientist

371
00:16:24.247 --> 00:16:26.541
to put the pieces together.

372
00:16:26.541 --> 00:16:27.893
I was one of the people that did that,

373
00:16:27.893 --> 00:16:29.417
I was the first one who did it actually,

374
00:16:29.417 --> 00:16:31.710
and I was the first one that went to the FBI

375
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:35.771
about how the Bayer Corporation was heavily implicated

376
00:16:35.771 --> 00:16:38.033
in not only the production of Cipro,

377
00:16:38.033 --> 00:16:42.416
the Johnny-on-the-spot, selected antibiotic for anthrax,

378
00:16:42.416 --> 00:16:46.225
but also the anthrax vaccine manufacturing company

379
00:16:46.225 --> 00:16:49.274
that was hideously condemned even by

380
00:16:49.274 --> 00:16:52.321
the United States Congress when they did an investigation.

381
00:16:52.321 --> 00:16:54.792
Completely neglected by the mainstream media.

382
00:16:54.792 --> 00:16:56.530
So people didn't get that information.

383
00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:57.878
Likewise they're not gonna get

384
00:16:57.878 --> 00:16:59.196
the background information.

385
00:16:59.196 --> 00:17:02.907
All they have to do is release some out of a little plane

386
00:17:02.907 --> 00:17:04.345
or spray some

387
00:17:04.345 --> 00:17:07.805
in a spraying unit in Los Angeles, let's say,

388
00:17:07.805 --> 00:17:09.692
or San Francisco.

389
00:17:09.692 --> 00:17:12.398
They'll loose H5N1

390
00:17:12.398 --> 00:17:14.638
and suddenly now they've got their outbreak

391
00:17:14.638 --> 00:17:16.867
and you know what's gonna happen in mainstream media,

392
00:17:16.867 --> 00:17:18.175
they're gonna go mad,

393
00:17:18.175 --> 00:17:21.198
and the fright is gonna be incredible.

394
00:17:21.198 --> 00:17:23.594
Then they will have Johnny-on-the-spot

395
00:17:23.594 --> 00:17:26.705
Novartis' H5N1-H1N1

396
00:17:26.705 --> 00:17:28.665
recombinant vaccine available,

397
00:17:28.665 --> 00:17:30.503
shipped out urgently,

398
00:17:30.503 --> 00:17:33.384
lines of people standing in line to get it,

399
00:17:33.384 --> 00:17:36.072
and that's how they would run the scenario.

400
00:17:36.072 --> 00:17:38.206
<v ->So in this worst-case scenario</v>

401
00:17:38.206 --> 00:17:41.759
that is a potential scenario, we know this,

402
00:17:41.919 --> 00:17:43.071
what can we do

403
00:17:43.071 --> 00:17:45.051
as individuals to protect ourselves from that

404
00:17:45.051 --> 00:17:47.110
and keep that stuff from being pumped into us?

405
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:48.119
And not only that,

406
00:17:48.119 --> 00:17:50.404
what can we do within our own immune systems

407
00:17:50.404 --> 00:17:53.294
to beef ourselves up so that we may not be as susceptible

408
00:17:53.294 --> 00:17:55.791
even if we're exposed to someone who has come down

409
00:17:55.791 --> 00:17:57.688
with those symptoms?

410
00:17:57.991 --> 00:18:01.466
<v ->Right now, you should be stockpiling OXYSILVER.</v>

411
00:18:01.466 --> 00:18:04.746
OXYSILVER is the most profound broad-spectrum--

412
00:18:04.746 --> 00:18:07.775
<v ->Is that a nanosilver, angstrom silver, colloidal silver?</v>

413
00:18:07.775 --> 00:18:10.930
<v ->It's a microfine silver that is on the nano range,</v>

414
00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.904
it's not nano technology.

415
00:18:12.904 --> 00:18:15.114
It's NASA technology

416
00:18:15.114 --> 00:18:17.723
that was based on sound and light,

417
00:18:17.723 --> 00:18:20.709
to be able to bond the microfine silver

418
00:18:20.709 --> 00:18:22.444
actually to the water

419
00:18:22.444 --> 00:18:24.765
via the oxygen molecule.

420
00:18:24.765 --> 00:18:26.012
The oxygen element.

421
00:18:26.012 --> 00:18:30.258
And H2O, so the oxygen therein actually has a covalent bond

422
00:18:30.258 --> 00:18:31.752
to the microfine silver,

423
00:18:31.752 --> 00:18:34.567
allowing it to go into the cells,

424
00:18:34.567 --> 00:18:37.212
even kill of the mycoplasma agents that are

425
00:18:37.212 --> 00:18:39.505
hard for the immune system to find,

426
00:18:39.505 --> 00:18:42.578
and then basically kills off the pathogens,

427
00:18:42.578 --> 00:18:45.442
the disease inducers in your body,

428
00:18:45.442 --> 00:18:46.802
and then it leaves the body.

429
00:18:46.802 --> 00:18:49.031
It doesn't accumulate in the tissues like the old

430
00:18:49.031 --> 00:18:51.005
colloidal silvers.

431
00:18:51.005 --> 00:18:54.236
Again, they were fine for their age but we have now--

432
00:18:54.236 --> 00:18:56.502
<v ->It's moved beyond that, and I know some of the people</v>

433
00:18:56.502 --> 00:18:58.972
behind the scenes that you've worked with on this technology

434
00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:01.329
who have a deep history and understanding

435
00:19:01.329 --> 00:19:03.765
of pretty advanced systems of healing.

436
00:19:03.765 --> 00:19:04.989
So I'll just say that.

437
00:19:04.989 --> 00:19:06.968
I also know that your OXYSILVER

438
00:19:06.968 --> 00:19:09.015
is being offered through Healthy World.

439
00:19:09.015 --> 00:19:11.753
<v ->Healthy World Affiliates is what I would recommend.</v>

440
00:19:11.753 --> 00:19:15.702
Because the healthyworldaffiliates.com opportunity

441
00:19:15.702 --> 00:19:18.560
is what we've created because we're all in this together.

442
00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.364
We're all one family being attacked right now.

443
00:19:21.364 --> 00:19:23.765
The war isn't really against the United States of America,

444
00:19:23.765 --> 00:19:25.386
it's not an international war.

445
00:19:25.386 --> 00:19:29.763
Right now the war is against your body sovereign.

446
00:19:30.516 --> 00:19:33.737
To get people to partner

447
00:19:33.737 --> 00:19:37.737
and to engage in an opportunity that can save lives,

448
00:19:37.737 --> 00:19:41.745
but also create sustainability, economically,

449
00:19:41.745 --> 00:19:44.484
in terms of prosperity in all ways.

450
00:19:44.484 --> 00:19:47.930
Eventually what you come when you study my work,

451
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:51.001
both the bad news in the virology

452
00:19:51.001 --> 00:19:54.453
and the bad news in how public health is being abused

453
00:19:54.453 --> 00:19:58.487
as a depopulation, genocidal operation,

454
00:19:58.487 --> 00:19:59.880
into the great news.

455
00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.939
What's been suppressed.

456
00:20:02.174 --> 00:20:06.182
For example, the product OXYSILVER has, just in itself,

457
00:20:06.182 --> 00:20:09.820
the capacity to bring Big Pharma to its knees.

458
00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.304
Because of the technology that's been suppressed

459
00:20:12.304 --> 00:20:14.673
by Big Pharma is so advanced

460
00:20:14.673 --> 00:20:18.555
and decrees how healing can be made so simple.

461
00:20:18.555 --> 00:20:20.788
This is a virtual mineral water.

462
00:20:20.788 --> 00:20:22.091
<v ->Right.</v>

463
00:20:22.091 --> 00:20:23.175
<v ->It's not a drug.</v>

464
00:20:23.175 --> 00:20:25.254
It can't be regulated by the FDA.

465
00:20:25.254 --> 00:20:28.840
You can't regulate mineral water as a drug.

466
00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.525
So how does it operate?

467
00:20:30.525 --> 00:20:32.497
Well it operates in three different ways,

468
00:20:32.497 --> 00:20:35.851
one is by destabilizing the germs,

469
00:20:35.851 --> 00:20:38.444
the electrons that robs the electrons leaving

470
00:20:38.444 --> 00:20:41.911
the germ coat destabilized,

471
00:20:41.911 --> 00:20:45.537
and then it swells with water and it bursts.

472
00:20:45.537 --> 00:20:47.531
That's the first thing it does.

473
00:20:47.531 --> 00:20:48.784
The second thing it does,

474
00:20:48.784 --> 00:20:51.381
it's unique to this particular product,

475
00:20:51.381 --> 00:20:54.172
is it has a oxygen cloud.

476
00:20:54.172 --> 00:20:57.255
So oxygen is the most healing of all the elements

477
00:20:57.255 --> 00:20:59.165
in the period table of elements.

478
00:20:59.165 --> 00:21:00.956
It is the most powerful healing element

479
00:21:00.956 --> 00:21:03.184
that's why oxygenation therapies,

480
00:21:03.184 --> 00:21:05.342
everything from neurological conditions

481
00:21:05.342 --> 00:21:06.448
are helped.

482
00:21:06.448 --> 00:21:07.738
Cancers--
<v ->Hyperbaric chambers.</v>

483
00:21:07.738 --> 00:21:10.238
<v ->Hyperbaric chambers, exactly.</v>

484
00:21:10.574 --> 00:21:15.056
So OXYSILVER has secondarily a oxygenating effect,

485
00:21:15.056 --> 00:21:18.054
but most important of all deals with this issue

486
00:21:18.054 --> 00:21:20.217
of 528 hertz frequency.

487
00:21:20.217 --> 00:21:22.490
It is a resonating liquid.

488
00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:26.358
Water and, think about it, silver water.

489
00:21:26.358 --> 00:21:28.855
Silver is a superconductor.

490
00:21:28.855 --> 00:21:31.197
Water is also a superconductor,

491
00:21:31.197 --> 00:21:33.748
it's a liquid crystal superconductor.

492
00:21:33.748 --> 00:21:37.414
So we now know that the reason a blade of grass

493
00:21:37.414 --> 00:21:39.335
is greenish-yellow,

494
00:21:39.335 --> 00:21:42.150
is because it's vibrating to 528.

495
00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:44.326
The botanical world gets it.

496
00:21:44.326 --> 00:21:48.139
It gets it because it's the center of the rainbow,

497
00:21:48.139 --> 00:21:49.916
the electromagnetic color spectrum.

498
00:21:49.916 --> 00:21:51.638
<v ->Heart chakra, classic.</v>

499
00:21:51.638 --> 00:21:53.232
<v ->The heart chakra, the heart.</v>

500
00:21:53.232 --> 00:21:54.582
As above, so below.

501
00:21:54.582 --> 00:21:58.114
As it is in your heart, so it is in the cosmos.

502
00:21:58.114 --> 00:22:01.117
So the reality is that the central frequency

503
00:22:01.117 --> 00:22:05.181
by which all of reality is manifested

504
00:22:05.181 --> 00:22:07.080
is in 528.

505
00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.486
Hertz frequency, that's cycles per second.

506
00:22:09.486 --> 00:22:12.980
OXYSILVER carries that resonance energy

507
00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.276
and it is a double superconductor

508
00:22:15.276 --> 00:22:17.037
of that resonance energy,

509
00:22:17.037 --> 00:22:20.010
and it is the first product that we actually

510
00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:23.701
urge people to pray with as you take OXYSILVER.

511
00:22:23.701 --> 00:22:27.072
It amplifies because it operates on that simplest

512
00:22:27.072 --> 00:22:29.487
of all systems of sustaining and healing,

513
00:22:29.487 --> 00:22:30.767
which is love.

514
00:22:30.767 --> 00:22:32.007
Which is the heart,

515
00:22:32.007 --> 00:22:35.853
which is the intention for recreating and healing.

516
00:22:35.853 --> 00:22:39.120
This is one of the things if people simply understood,

517
00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.533
now we've got clearly the most powerful of all

518
00:22:42.533 --> 00:22:45.336
of the broad-spectrum antimicrobials

519
00:22:45.336 --> 00:22:48.041
competing directly with all the antibiotics.

520
00:22:48.041 --> 00:22:51.496
In fact, making antibiotics which are so toxic,

521
00:22:51.496 --> 00:22:54.044
and all vaccinations obsolete,

522
00:22:54.044 --> 00:22:55.549
with this one product,

523
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:57.537
and then they understand how it works

524
00:22:57.537 --> 00:22:58.796
so miraculously,

525
00:22:58.796 --> 00:23:00.959
that's the end of the medical paradigm.

526
00:23:00.959 --> 00:23:04.649
You get engaged in how healing actually takes place,

527
00:23:04.649 --> 00:23:06.196
and the truth of the matter is

528
00:23:06.196 --> 00:23:08.436
all of the drug industrialists,

529
00:23:08.436 --> 00:23:10.058
and the vaccine industrialists,

530
00:23:10.058 --> 00:23:12.128
they're working with chemicals.

531
00:23:12.128 --> 00:23:16.232
But if we understand that's spiritual,

532
00:23:16.232 --> 00:23:17.906
it's not against flesh and blood with whom

533
00:23:17.906 --> 00:23:19.178
we do battle.

534
00:23:19.178 --> 00:23:21.005
Underlying physical,

535
00:23:21.005 --> 00:23:23.155
more powerful than chemistry,

536
00:23:23.155 --> 00:23:24.778
is spirituality,

537
00:23:24.778 --> 00:23:26.506
and sound and light signaling.

538
00:23:26.506 --> 00:23:29.994
That's what genetics is about really fundamentally.

539
00:23:29.994 --> 00:23:33.357
And that when we engage the music of divinity,

540
00:23:33.357 --> 00:23:36.679
what all of nature's vibrating to,

541
00:23:36.898 --> 00:23:40.581
and dogs chew grass,

542
00:23:40.581 --> 00:23:43.863
wheat grass to heal when they're sick,

543
00:23:43.863 --> 00:23:45.484
instinctively.

544
00:23:45.655 --> 00:23:48.705
That knowledge, that intelligence

545
00:23:48.705 --> 00:23:52.810
is exactly what can shift the whole paradigm

546
00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:56.732
of this focus on intoxication and injection,

547
00:23:56.732 --> 00:23:58.463
for now, depopulation.

548
00:23:58.463 --> 00:24:02.603
Shift out of that paradigm into real healing.

549
00:24:02.891 --> 00:24:04.944
<v ->And it's interesting because it's actually</v>

550
00:24:04.944 --> 00:24:07.744
having the OXYSILVER,

551
00:24:07.744 --> 00:24:09.391
it's the brand name that you're working with

552
00:24:09.391 --> 00:24:10.793
with this product.

553
00:24:10.793 --> 00:24:14.099
Having the OXYSILVER almost serves as

554
00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:16.738
a totem, in a sense,

555
00:24:16.738 --> 00:24:18.997
to be able to impregnate with consciousness

556
00:24:18.997 --> 00:24:21.423
in addition to the physical properties of it.

557
00:24:21.423 --> 00:24:24.488
It's really a segue into work and encouraging

558
00:24:24.488 --> 00:24:26.910
human beings to work with our own consciousness

559
00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:28.413
in our own healing process,

560
00:24:28.413 --> 00:24:30.164
because we know through all of the research

561
00:24:30.164 --> 00:24:33.547
that's been done since the 1940s and 50s

562
00:24:33.547 --> 00:24:37.127
on the clustering structure

563
00:24:37.127 --> 00:24:38.757
and memory of water.

564
00:24:38.757 --> 00:24:42.277
We know that water interfaces, Dr. Masaru Emoto's work,

565
00:24:42.277 --> 00:24:44.207
we know that it interfaces with our thoughts,

566
00:24:44.207 --> 00:24:45.337
with our consciousness,

567
00:24:45.337 --> 00:24:47.145
with our feelings and our emotions.

568
00:24:47.145 --> 00:24:50.003
So I see it as a really beautiful opportunity

569
00:24:50.003 --> 00:24:53.989
to remind people as they're beefing their immune system up

570
00:24:53.989 --> 00:24:57.063
with this mineral water, we shall say,

571
00:24:57.063 --> 00:24:58.757
to really seize on what you said,

572
00:24:58.757 --> 00:25:00.453
to use consciousness with it as well.

573
00:25:00.453 --> 00:25:02.140
Because this is the bridge.

574
00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:03.420
This is where everything's going.

575
00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:04.977
This is our healing of the future.

576
00:25:04.977 --> 00:25:06.018
<v ->Exactly right.</v>

577
00:25:06.018 --> 00:25:08.141
<v ->This is a good time then to start segueing over</v>

578
00:25:08.141 --> 00:25:10.946
into the frequencies of the music

579
00:25:10.946 --> 00:25:13.214
and the 528 frequency that you're talking about.

580
00:25:13.214 --> 00:25:15.645
I listened to your talk yesterday and found some things

581
00:25:15.645 --> 00:25:18.681
that are really interesting that,

582
00:25:18.999 --> 00:25:20.723
lot of times in my line of work I feel like

583
00:25:20.723 --> 00:25:22.314
I've almost heard it all,

584
00:25:22.314 --> 00:25:25.823
but I had not heard this before and find it fascinating

585
00:25:25.823 --> 00:25:28.163
as I'm sure everybody listening will.

586
00:25:28.163 --> 00:25:30.665
Let's go back to the year 1938,

587
00:25:30.665 --> 00:25:32.806
we're talking about frequencies where there was

588
00:25:32.806 --> 00:25:35.726
some kind of a charter or standardization,

589
00:25:35.726 --> 00:25:37.538
you can set us straight on this,

590
00:25:37.538 --> 00:25:41.369
of frequencies, under Joseph Goebbels.

591
00:25:41.369 --> 00:25:43.979
Joseph Goebbels was promoting

592
00:25:43.979 --> 00:25:46.589
A440 hertz.

593
00:25:46.589 --> 00:25:49.849
And this is part of a New World Order agenda,

594
00:25:49.849 --> 00:25:53.633
and it was adopted by the British Standards Institute.

595
00:25:53.979 --> 00:25:56.752
Just launch on this and tell us what this all about,

596
00:25:56.752 --> 00:25:59.249
and take us through some of the history

597
00:25:59.814 --> 00:26:01.989
for anyone who doesn't know what we're talking about yet.

598
00:26:01.989 --> 00:26:03.511
Start from the beginning.

599
00:26:03.511 --> 00:26:06.459
<v ->Well Joseph Goebbels was the propaganda minister</v>

600
00:26:06.459 --> 00:26:08.276
for the Third Reich,

601
00:26:08.276 --> 00:26:10.778
and in 1938, as you mentioned,

602
00:26:10.778 --> 00:26:15.205
he was promoting on behalf of a global cartel.

603
00:26:15.205 --> 00:26:17.822
In this particular case you had RCA,

604
00:26:17.822 --> 00:26:19.644
you had General Electric,

605
00:26:19.644 --> 00:26:23.566
you had EMI which people know as Abbey Road

606
00:26:23.566 --> 00:26:25.973
where the Beatles did their recordings.

607
00:26:25.973 --> 00:26:27.966
You had these organizations

608
00:26:27.966 --> 00:26:30.292
along with the United States Navy,

609
00:26:30.292 --> 00:26:33.367
that were serving a Rothchild-Rockafeller

610
00:26:33.367 --> 00:26:35.997
banking cartel's agenda

611
00:26:35.997 --> 00:26:38.747
to develop war technology.

612
00:26:38.747 --> 00:26:41.659
Through acoustics, and acoustic science.

613
00:26:41.659 --> 00:26:45.102
They had determined that there were certain frequencies

614
00:26:45.102 --> 00:26:48.158
that would cause mass hysteria.

615
00:26:48.368 --> 00:26:50.044
That's what they were looking for.

616
00:26:50.044 --> 00:26:53.583
They were looking for psycho-emotional triggers

617
00:26:53.583 --> 00:26:56.576
that would induce stress, induce illness,

618
00:26:56.576 --> 00:27:00.255
induce confusion, and mass hysteria.

619
00:27:00.255 --> 00:27:02.580
And of course if you think about it,

620
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.416
naturally they would be looking for it,

621
00:27:04.416 --> 00:27:08.373
how to use music, how to apply music to the media,

622
00:27:08.373 --> 00:27:10.902
to film, to radio,

623
00:27:10.902 --> 00:27:14.776
that would actually increase the markets

624
00:27:14.776 --> 00:27:17.308
for pharmaceuticals.

625
00:27:17.308 --> 00:27:20.355
So who was, in 1938,

626
00:27:20.355 --> 00:27:23.255
the major pharmaceutical industrialist?

627
00:27:23.255 --> 00:27:26.272
Well, it was Rockefeller Standard Oil Company,

628
00:27:26.272 --> 00:27:28.067
allied with IG Farben,

629
00:27:28.067 --> 00:27:30.230
Germany's leading industrial organization

630
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:33.221
that for all practical purposes was the Third Reich.

631
00:27:33.221 --> 00:27:36.208
Their top officials were the top SS.

632
00:27:36.208 --> 00:27:38.258
They were partnered completely,

633
00:27:38.258 --> 00:27:41.507
in fact married is the term that US federal judge

634
00:27:41.507 --> 00:27:45.628
decreed was the best adjective,

635
00:27:45.628 --> 00:27:50.235
for the Rockefeller German petrochemical pharmaceutical

636
00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:52.543
cartel called IG Farben.

637
00:27:52.543 --> 00:27:55.794
So they had started the Rockefeller Archives

638
00:27:55.794 --> 00:27:57.850
and the Rockefeller Foundation.

639
00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:01.142
When they started eugenics, which we talked about earlier,

640
00:28:01.142 --> 00:28:04.016
which was the racial hygiene.

641
00:28:04.236 --> 00:28:06.148
Before Hitler called it racial hygiene it was called

642
00:28:06.148 --> 00:28:07.743
eugenics.

643
00:28:07.873 --> 00:28:11.508
They were looking to control certain unwanted populations

644
00:28:11.508 --> 00:28:14.180
by inducing illnesses genetically,

645
00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.853
and causing sterility through injection of everything

646
00:28:17.853 --> 00:28:20.428
from viruses, et cetera.

647
00:28:21.016 --> 00:28:23.153
And chemical toxicity.

648
00:28:23.293 --> 00:28:26.502
Back in the time that the Rockefellers funded the

649
00:28:26.502 --> 00:28:28.512
Kaiser Wilhelm Institute,

650
00:28:28.512 --> 00:28:31.476
for eugenics, anthropology, and human heredity,

651
00:28:31.476 --> 00:28:33.112
in pre-Nazi Germany,

652
00:28:33.112 --> 00:28:36.166
with Ernst Rudin being a premiere promoter.

653
00:28:36.166 --> 00:28:38.748
And Marian Wright Edelman was promoting eugenics,

654
00:28:38.748 --> 00:28:42.989
this is the origin of what Hillary Rodham Clinton

655
00:28:42.989 --> 00:28:44.579
is engaged in currently,

656
00:28:44.579 --> 00:28:46.513
the Children's Rights agenda.

657
00:28:46.513 --> 00:28:50.506
All of this was unfolding at that time,

658
00:28:50.506 --> 00:28:53.010
along with the military research

659
00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:56.648
into how to induce mass hysteria.

660
00:28:57.938 --> 00:29:02.072
It was determined that A440 hertz frequency

661
00:29:02.072 --> 00:29:05.229
was the quote, best frequency,

662
00:29:05.229 --> 00:29:07.579
for standard tuning

663
00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:11.931
by these same experts in acoustic science.

664
00:29:12.978 --> 00:29:16.119
There was no other reason given

665
00:29:16.119 --> 00:29:19.872
for A440 being selected.

666
00:29:23.494 --> 00:29:26.952
The only explanation that they gave us was

667
00:29:26.952 --> 00:29:30.175
that it was close to 439,

668
00:29:30.175 --> 00:29:32.511
which some of the orchestras in Europe

669
00:29:32.511 --> 00:29:34.175
had been tuning to.

670
00:29:34.175 --> 00:29:37.169
But other than that, those frequencies themselves

671
00:29:37.169 --> 00:29:39.522
had also been

672
00:29:43.626 --> 00:29:45.185
taken on,

673
00:29:45.185 --> 00:29:48.318
and without any clear reason or rationale.

674
00:29:48.318 --> 00:29:52.552
But the A440 emerged out of this consortium

675
00:29:52.552 --> 00:29:56.857
of experts in military war research in acoustics.

676
00:29:56.857 --> 00:29:59.197
<v ->We're talking about the US Navy was involved,</v>

677
00:29:59.197 --> 00:30:01.421
the Princeton Radio Project,

678
00:30:01.421 --> 00:30:04.416
there was even an implication did you say yesterday,

679
00:30:04.416 --> 00:30:05.990
Manhattan Project?

680
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:09.442
Was that loosely related or affiliated to an extent?

681
00:30:09.442 --> 00:30:13.246
<v ->It was in location and it was in funding,</v>

682
00:30:13.246 --> 00:30:16.026
in so far as the Rockefeller Foundation

683
00:30:16.026 --> 00:30:18.395
at this same period in history,

684
00:30:18.395 --> 00:30:21.505
was funding the Manhattan Project

685
00:30:21.505 --> 00:30:23.545
through the organization,

686
00:30:23.545 --> 00:30:25.356
think it's called the IAS.

687
00:30:25.356 --> 00:30:26.927
<v ->Yes, right, IAS.</v>

688
00:30:26.927 --> 00:30:28.944
<v ->That this organization</v>

689
00:30:28.944 --> 00:30:31.924
was where Einstein operated from

690
00:30:31.924 --> 00:30:36.024
and this organization bringing it into the health arena,

691
00:30:36.024 --> 00:30:40.390
was founded by the man that instituted modern medicine,

692
00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:43.528
to have the monopoly over healthcare.

693
00:30:43.528 --> 00:30:45.738
It was Abraham Flexner.

694
00:30:45.738 --> 00:30:48.858
Flexner and the Flexner Report is infamous in history

695
00:30:48.858 --> 00:30:52.379
for having demonized chiropractic and homeopathic

696
00:30:52.379 --> 00:30:55.094
and all of the alternatives to pharmaceutical

697
00:30:55.094 --> 00:30:58.013
allopathic drug-based care.

698
00:30:58.013 --> 00:31:01.469
This is the same group of people that were involved--

699
00:31:01.469 --> 00:31:04.410
<v ->Is this called military war music research?</v>

700
00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:07.491
<v ->It was military war music research, that's exactly right.</v>

701
00:31:07.491 --> 00:31:10.441
Military frequency acoustic science research,

702
00:31:10.441 --> 00:31:11.773
that was engaged.

703
00:31:11.773 --> 00:31:15.970
And the Princeton Radio Project which was also right in

704
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:18.350
the same neighborhood of Princeton,

705
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:20.975
with the Manhattan Project funded likewise

706
00:31:20.975 --> 00:31:23.585
by the Rockefeller Foundation and the

707
00:31:23.585 --> 00:31:25.825
Rothchild-Rockefeller banking cartel,

708
00:31:25.825 --> 00:31:29.115
to bring about the methods and technologies of war,

709
00:31:29.115 --> 00:31:32.967
including the most advanced energy weaponry,

710
00:31:32.967 --> 00:31:34.311
nuclear.

711
00:31:34.311 --> 00:31:35.796
But you have to understand,

712
00:31:35.796 --> 00:31:39.191
energy weaponry, for the human being,

713
00:31:39.191 --> 00:31:41.136
is frequency.

714
00:31:41.136 --> 00:31:43.450
Music, sound, vibration.

715
00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:46.932
So this is what they were engaged in at the time.

716
00:31:46.932 --> 00:31:49.019
<v ->So what happened then?</v>

717
00:31:49.286 --> 00:31:52.097
The 440 was introduced and you talked about something,

718
00:31:52.097 --> 00:31:55.220
I can't remember now and I don't have it in my notes.

719
00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.207
It was an observation made regarding

720
00:31:59.373 --> 00:32:02.646
tuning to an organ in a symphony.

721
00:32:05.364 --> 00:32:07.170
The organ would tune to 440,

722
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:09.513
they'd have a devil of a time trying to get to 440,

723
00:32:09.513 --> 00:32:12.148
and automatically we'd surface back

724
00:32:12.148 --> 00:32:15.926
and fall back into a 444 which is a harmonious tone, right?

725
00:32:15.926 --> 00:32:16.818
<v ->Right.</v>

726
00:32:16.818 --> 00:32:18.457
<v ->So their beings unconsciously</v>

727
00:32:18.457 --> 00:32:20.557
kept trying to go to the healthy frequencies

728
00:32:20.557 --> 00:32:22.481
even though they were being promoted and directed

729
00:32:22.481 --> 00:32:24.675
to go to the 440 frequency.

730
00:32:24.675 --> 00:32:25.902
<v ->Right.</v>

731
00:32:25.902 --> 00:32:28.920
The actual beginning in the United States

732
00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.853
of this effort to get musicians to tune

733
00:32:31.853 --> 00:32:34.481
to A440 hertz frequency as a standard,

734
00:32:34.481 --> 00:32:38.624
started between 1913 and 1918.

735
00:32:38.844 --> 00:32:42.005
Again, Rockefeller Foundation funded.

736
00:32:42.005 --> 00:32:43.972
<v ->This is so insidious. (brief giggling)</v>

737
00:32:43.972 --> 00:32:45.998
<v ->So that didn't go over well,</v>

738
00:32:45.998 --> 00:32:49.237
although the did persuade officials at the

739
00:32:49.237 --> 00:32:51.806
American Federation of Musicians

740
00:32:51.806 --> 00:32:54.986
to institute that, it never went over well,

741
00:32:54.986 --> 00:32:56.970
and the European musicians,

742
00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:59.457
where the real culture is coming from Europe,

743
00:32:59.457 --> 00:33:01.194
particularly in classical music

744
00:33:01.194 --> 00:33:02.894
and in orchestras.

745
00:33:02.894 --> 00:33:05.603
These folks completely rejected it.

746
00:33:05.603 --> 00:33:08.795
That's why they had to turn to Joseph Goebbels,

747
00:33:08.795 --> 00:33:11.165
because this propaganda minister who was the

748
00:33:11.165 --> 00:33:13.630
principal nemesis

749
00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:17.457
of the British Intelligence.

750
00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.998
You have to understand this date of 1939,

751
00:33:20.998 --> 00:33:23.023
when they actually instituted

752
00:33:23.023 --> 00:33:26.406
following the British Standards Institute's evaluation

753
00:33:26.406 --> 00:33:29.502
of the information presented by the experts,

754
00:33:29.502 --> 00:33:31.527
along with Joseph Goebbels,

755
00:33:31.527 --> 00:33:34.744
this was the frequency that they selected.

756
00:33:34.744 --> 00:33:36.249
At the very time

757
00:33:36.249 --> 00:33:40.248
that they saw Hitler's militarization

758
00:33:41.065 --> 00:33:45.479
about to engage war on Poland to start World War II.

759
00:33:45.479 --> 00:33:48.959
Here's Hitler's top propagandist promoting this,

760
00:33:48.959 --> 00:33:52.440
and the Brit's principal enemy,

761
00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.101
they select his frequency?

762
00:33:55.101 --> 00:33:57.059
And say yes, we will go along with this

763
00:33:57.059 --> 00:34:00.098
for all of the European musicians?

764
00:34:00.098 --> 00:34:01.624
So that's what happened,

765
00:34:01.624 --> 00:34:05.276
that's how we instituted A440 hertz standard tuning.

766
00:34:05.276 --> 00:34:09.253
And it's like you said, the top expert in the field,

767
00:34:09.253 --> 00:34:13.044
there's two actually, one contemporary Lynn Cavanagh

768
00:34:13.044 --> 00:34:17.529
who has written the definitive article examining

769
00:34:17.529 --> 00:34:21.726
how and why did we implement this completely arbitrary,

770
00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:24.581
totally questionable frequency for standard tuning

771
00:34:24.581 --> 00:34:26.307
of musical instruments.

772
00:34:26.307 --> 00:34:30.332
She reviewed the literature and among her reviewed sources

773
00:34:30.332 --> 00:34:34.754
is a Llewelyn Lloyd, who is an expert in the 1940s,

774
00:34:34.754 --> 00:34:38.623
published in the Royal Society of Arts and Sciences

775
00:34:38.623 --> 00:34:40.542
in the music arena,

776
00:34:40.542 --> 00:34:43.521
dealt with this absurdity

777
00:34:43.521 --> 00:34:46.461
of the frequency of A440

778
00:34:46.461 --> 00:34:48.457
being dissonant

779
00:34:48.457 --> 00:34:52.876
to what in the hearts of musicians, that they normally feel.

780
00:34:52.876 --> 00:34:56.093
And he was the one that used an example.

781
00:34:56.093 --> 00:34:58.504
He would say, for example,

782
00:34:59.097 --> 00:35:00.556
and he did this,

783
00:35:00.556 --> 00:35:02.921
he would tune at the beginning of a concert,

784
00:35:02.921 --> 00:35:04.824
of course all the instruments would be tuned

785
00:35:04.824 --> 00:35:08.044
to one particular organ, frequency,

786
00:35:08.044 --> 00:35:10.506
that they set as A440.

787
00:35:10.506 --> 00:35:12.520
And he says, yes we could do that.

788
00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:16.082
We could get all the musicians to tune to that frequency,

789
00:35:16.082 --> 00:35:19.104
but by the time the concert ended,

790
00:35:19.104 --> 00:35:22.762
all of their frequencies were higher.

791
00:35:22.762 --> 00:35:26.543
The musicians actually tuned up so that the organ itself

792
00:35:26.543 --> 00:35:30.022
was lower by about 4 hertz.

793
00:35:30.022 --> 00:35:32.518
And he stated that specifically.

794
00:35:32.518 --> 00:35:36.916
Now in research we've learned that A444,

795
00:35:36.916 --> 00:35:40.754
which is what the natural instinct of those musicians

796
00:35:40.754 --> 00:35:43.381
and the concert,

797
00:35:45.991 --> 00:35:48.381
basically the leaders of the orchestra,

798
00:35:48.381 --> 00:35:49.818
and the arrangers,

799
00:35:49.818 --> 00:35:52.854
and those compositions were produced by people who are

800
00:35:52.854 --> 00:35:54.680
in the spirit when they produce it.

801
00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.144
<v ->Yeah, so their hearts are naturally tuning them back.</v>

802
00:35:57.144 --> 00:35:57.914
<v ->Exactly.</v>

803
00:35:57.914 --> 00:36:00.562
<v ->So take just a moment to explain the connection between</v>

804
00:36:00.562 --> 00:36:03.269
A444 and 528.

805
00:36:03.269 --> 00:36:05.412
<v ->Sure, the research indicates</v>

806
00:36:05.412 --> 00:36:08.612
that A444 is the equivalent

807
00:36:08.612 --> 00:36:11.678
to C5 528.

808
00:36:11.678 --> 00:36:13.295
C5 is the octave,

809
00:36:13.295 --> 00:36:16.534
it's the fifth C on the piano.

810
00:36:16.534 --> 00:36:19.200
<v ->So it's essentially the same heart resonance?</v>

811
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.263
<v ->It's the same.</v>

812
00:36:20.263 --> 00:36:22.096
<v ->Okay, I just wanted to clarify that so people</v>

813
00:36:22.096 --> 00:36:23.873
didn't get confused.
<v ->If you get really technical</v>

814
00:36:23.873 --> 00:36:26.306
about it, the folks that I work with

815
00:36:26.306 --> 00:36:27.732
who are advanced physicists,

816
00:36:27.732 --> 00:36:29.434
I'm not an expert in this field,

817
00:36:29.434 --> 00:36:31.818
I'm just relaying what the experts have relayed to me.

818
00:36:31.818 --> 00:36:32.952
<v ->Okay.</v>

819
00:36:32.952 --> 00:36:34.557
<v ->It's actually,</v>

820
00:36:34.737 --> 00:36:37.358
399 point,

821
00:36:37.358 --> 00:36:38.777
I think it's,

822
00:36:39.007 --> 00:36:40.303
a couple digits,

823
00:36:40.303 --> 00:36:41.988
if you wanna be real precise.

824
00:36:41.988 --> 00:36:44.163
But if you tune on, for example,

825
00:36:44.163 --> 00:36:47.152
what's available to us is chord chromatic tuners,

826
00:36:47.152 --> 00:36:49.906
or the little instruments that we could use

827
00:36:49.906 --> 00:36:52.915
to tune our guitars and our instruments.

828
00:36:53.125 --> 00:36:56.673
444 is so close

829
00:36:56.673 --> 00:36:59.353
to C5 528

830
00:36:59.353 --> 00:37:01.406
that you can't even perceive the difference,

831
00:37:01.406 --> 00:37:04.841
And the harmonic resonance is such that's it's likewise

832
00:37:04.841 --> 00:37:07.925
uplifting and fulfilling,

833
00:37:07.925 --> 00:37:10.407
in terms of the heart energy and the heart chakra.

834
00:37:10.407 --> 00:37:11.954
<v ->It's like it vibrates the heart strings,</v>

835
00:37:11.954 --> 00:37:13.943
everybody knows it when they feel it.

836
00:37:13.943 --> 00:37:15.486
Okay, just wanted to get that clarified

837
00:37:15.486 --> 00:37:16.628
so people didn't confuse,

838
00:37:16.628 --> 00:37:18.356
444, 440.

839
00:37:18.356 --> 00:37:20.075
Now we understand this.

840
00:37:20.075 --> 00:37:21.993
Now let's go back to 440.

841
00:37:21.993 --> 00:37:24.648
There was another little known thing that you mentioned,

842
00:37:24.648 --> 00:37:26.576
it has to do with Colonel Tom Parker,

843
00:37:26.576 --> 00:37:28.448
and I think anybody, certainly in our age group,

844
00:37:28.448 --> 00:37:31.253
knows that this was the man behind Elvis Presley.

845
00:37:31.253 --> 00:37:34.408
So talk a little bit about that and the introduction

846
00:37:34.408 --> 00:37:36.945
into rock music of the 440.

847
00:37:36.945 --> 00:37:41.220
<v ->Well, he has a very infamous history.</v>

848
00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:45.329
Somehow Colonel Tom Parker which was an alias.

849
00:37:46.878 --> 00:37:49.142
I can't even remember his original name,

850
00:37:49.142 --> 00:37:50.598
he was from the Netherlands,

851
00:37:50.598 --> 00:37:52.271
he came to the United States

852
00:37:52.271 --> 00:37:54.979
and enlisted in the Army

853
00:37:54.979 --> 00:37:56.989
in 1928,

854
00:37:56.989 --> 00:37:58.985
and he did that illegally.

855
00:37:58.985 --> 00:38:00.341
<v ->He wasn't an American citizen?</v>

856
00:38:00.341 --> 00:38:01.707
<v ->He was not an American citizen,</v>

857
00:38:01.707 --> 00:38:04.196
he could not, he had no right.

858
00:38:04.196 --> 00:38:08.239
It occurs to those of us that have now studied his history,

859
00:38:08.239 --> 00:38:10.547
what happened with Elvis Presley,

860
00:38:10.547 --> 00:38:13.899
it appears that Colonel Tom Parker was Elvis' handler.

861
00:38:13.899 --> 00:38:14.733
<v ->Yes.</v>

862
00:38:14.733 --> 00:38:18.018
<v ->Who was clearly in communication with</v>

863
00:38:18.018 --> 00:38:21.110
Army Special Services Intelligence division,

864
00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:24.524
and the induction of Elvis Presley into the military

865
00:38:24.524 --> 00:38:27.674
was directed by Colonel Tom Parker

866
00:38:27.674 --> 00:38:29.526
through the Secret Services,

867
00:38:29.526 --> 00:38:33.720
Special Services is Secret Services and Intelligence.

868
00:38:34.342 --> 00:38:38.802
The interesting link is that

869
00:38:38.802 --> 00:38:41.882
Elvis was the first one

870
00:38:41.882 --> 00:38:43.762
that I'm aware of in history,

871
00:38:43.762 --> 00:38:48.024
who had this crowd reaction of mass hysteria.

872
00:38:48.024 --> 00:38:51.545
In fact, that what they used to describe the audience

873
00:38:51.545 --> 00:38:54.073
reaction to Elvis.

874
00:38:54.893 --> 00:38:57.310
<v ->Now this is true, because prior to him there had been</v>

875
00:38:57.310 --> 00:38:59.438
stars such as Frank Sinatra.

876
00:38:59.438 --> 00:39:01.681
There had been huge global stars.

877
00:39:01.681 --> 00:39:03.376
<v ->They were swooning women.</v>

878
00:39:03.376 --> 00:39:05.066
<v ->There was swooning.</v>

879
00:39:05.066 --> 00:39:08.857
<v ->But they didn't have this mass hysterical rioting.</v>

880
00:39:08.857 --> 00:39:11.094
<v ->Sobbing, rioting, yes.</v>

881
00:39:11.094 --> 00:39:13.815
<v ->And that's what they did with Elvis.</v>

882
00:39:13.815 --> 00:39:17.753
If you begin to piece together these elements,

883
00:39:17.753 --> 00:39:20.790
it's highly incriminating because again,

884
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:22.056
RCA,

885
00:39:22.056 --> 00:39:24.327
which Colonel Tom Parker

886
00:39:24.327 --> 00:39:27.339
had negotiated Elvis' contract,

887
00:39:27.339 --> 00:39:29.566
he was an RCA recording artist.

888
00:39:29.566 --> 00:39:33.693
And you understand Radio Corporation of America's emergance

889
00:39:33.693 --> 00:39:38.011
out of this Rockefeller- Rothchild cartel.

890
00:39:38.011 --> 00:39:41.569
The banking cartel that had the global domination,

891
00:39:41.569 --> 00:39:44.395
One World Order orientation,

892
00:39:44.395 --> 00:39:46.713
funding the Nazis as they did,

893
00:39:46.713 --> 00:39:50.945
funding the JPMorgan Chase today,

894
00:39:50.945 --> 00:39:54.671
back then it was JPMorgan who was the bagman

895
00:39:54.671 --> 00:39:57.299
for the Rothchild's giving money to the Rockefellers

896
00:39:57.299 --> 00:40:00.418
to actually create the Rockefeller's dominance

897
00:40:00.418 --> 00:40:03.691
over the petrochemical and pharmaceutical industry.

898
00:40:03.691 --> 00:40:07.602
So this is a cabal of major movers and shakers

899
00:40:07.602 --> 00:40:11.717
in the financial industry,

900
00:40:12.427 --> 00:40:15.448
actually funding both sides of every war.

901
00:40:15.448 --> 00:40:19.921
And so they did that, and important in their process was

902
00:40:19.921 --> 00:40:21.830
this propaganda,

903
00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:25.454
this population manipulation through music.

904
00:40:25.454 --> 00:40:28.422
<v ->Was this used through the Nazi propaganda</v>

905
00:40:28.422 --> 00:40:31.045
in the war music, the military music of the Nazis?

906
00:40:31.045 --> 00:40:35.609
<v ->Exactly, this was the music that would drive stress,</v>

907
00:40:35.609 --> 00:40:39.818
flight-or-fight reactions, optimally.

908
00:40:39.818 --> 00:40:41.388
The research that we have,

909
00:40:41.388 --> 00:40:44.058
and it's still in its infancy,

910
00:40:44.058 --> 00:40:46.917
we really need a research institute with some

911
00:40:46.917 --> 00:40:48.416
top people involved.

912
00:40:48.416 --> 00:40:50.675
But from the people that we've been working with already

913
00:40:50.675 --> 00:40:52.715
who are pretty genius,

914
00:40:52.715 --> 00:40:56.886
they have determined the throat chakra on down

915
00:40:56.886 --> 00:41:00.773
is blocked by A440 standard tuning.

916
00:41:00.783 --> 00:41:04.124
And it stimulates throat chakra up,

917
00:41:04.124 --> 00:41:06.163
so it stimulates ego,

918
00:41:06.163 --> 00:41:09.990
it stimulates this whole left-brain consciousness

919
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:12.885
where it's perfect if you wanna promote

920
00:41:12.885 --> 00:41:15.155
the god of science,

921
00:41:15.155 --> 00:41:18.915
or the god of technology, or the medical deities

922
00:41:18.915 --> 00:41:20.804
who are gonna cure you from your illnesses.

923
00:41:20.804 --> 00:41:22.734
<v ->So it separates us from our true feeling.</v>

924
00:41:22.734 --> 00:41:25.017
<v ->It separates us from the heart,</v>

925
00:41:25.017 --> 00:41:29.301
and it's the heart that the creative arts

926
00:41:29.301 --> 00:41:31.620
is really connected to.

927
00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.959
And needs to be connected to,

928
00:41:33.959 --> 00:41:35.300
and celebrated.

929
00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:37.169
Because if you talk to every good musician

930
00:41:37.169 --> 00:41:39.027
and good vocalist when they're performing

931
00:41:39.027 --> 00:41:40.428
and they're in the flow,

932
00:41:40.428 --> 00:41:43.246
in other words their voice is completely registered divine,

933
00:41:43.246 --> 00:41:45.849
and their musical instrument becomes part of their being

934
00:41:45.849 --> 00:41:48.137
so that they actually compose

935
00:41:48.137 --> 00:41:50.877
and they express divinity,

936
00:41:50.877 --> 00:41:52.828
through their hearts.

937
00:41:52.828 --> 00:41:56.306
This is how to optimize your performance.

938
00:41:56.306 --> 00:42:00.484
So this is what the top experts and the top celebrities

939
00:42:00.484 --> 00:42:03.272
in the field of music understand already.

940
00:42:03.272 --> 00:42:06.635
What they don't understand is what you're bringing out now.

941
00:42:06.635 --> 00:42:11.106
That A440 standard tuning does the optimum suppression

942
00:42:11.106 --> 00:42:14.603
of that clear channel broadcast from,

943
00:42:14.804 --> 00:42:16.940
the heavenly throne if you will.

944
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:20.108
God's core creator frequencies we know now,

945
00:42:20.108 --> 00:42:23.147
there's only nine core creator frequencies,

946
00:42:23.147 --> 00:42:25.713
of which 528 is central.

947
00:42:25.713 --> 00:42:29.078
You can to love528.com,

948
00:42:29.078 --> 00:42:32.641
read Victor Showell's incredible papers,

949
00:42:32.641 --> 00:42:36.325
read other researchers in the field like Marco Rodin,

950
00:42:36.325 --> 00:42:38.301
who is a mathematical genius,

951
00:42:38.301 --> 00:42:41.019
who determined there's a matrix of math,

952
00:42:41.019 --> 00:42:42.613
or music, in the universe.

953
00:42:42.613 --> 00:42:44.753
'Cause music is mathematics.

954
00:42:44.753 --> 00:42:45.877
<v ->It's frequencies.</v>

955
00:42:45.877 --> 00:42:47.752
<v ->Frequencies, cycles per second.</v>

956
00:42:47.752 --> 00:42:50.021
It's totally scriptural in sense in the beginning

957
00:42:50.021 --> 00:42:52.859
there was the Creator and the water.

958
00:42:52.859 --> 00:42:55.888
Now most of your body is made of water.

959
00:42:55.888 --> 00:42:58.495
Like you mentioned, Dr. Emoto's brilliant work

960
00:42:58.495 --> 00:43:00.261
showing water's conscious,

961
00:43:00.261 --> 00:43:02.550
it reacts, it responds

962
00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:05.747
to words of prayer, words are sounds,

963
00:43:05.747 --> 00:43:07.918
sound is electromagnetic frequencies,

964
00:43:07.918 --> 00:43:09.207
that's simply math.

965
00:43:09.207 --> 00:43:11.378
The Creator's language is math.

966
00:43:11.378 --> 00:43:15.203
Creation is a manifestation of mathematics,

967
00:43:15.203 --> 00:43:17.749
music coming out of water.

968
00:43:17.749 --> 00:43:21.186
<v ->So if you can distort that to point where we can no longer</v>

969
00:43:21.186 --> 00:43:25.363
feel the nature of love coming through our own instrument

970
00:43:25.363 --> 00:43:26.451
as it were,

971
00:43:26.451 --> 00:43:29.405
you have a highly controllable population.

972
00:43:29.405 --> 00:43:31.434
That you can steer the emotions.

973
00:43:31.434 --> 00:43:33.799
<v ->Absolutely, and again going back to what I said,</v>

974
00:43:33.799 --> 00:43:38.010
this is the top technology for population manipulation.

975
00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:39.736
If you're dealing with energy,

976
00:43:39.736 --> 00:43:41.816
you're the energy industrialist and you're advancing

977
00:43:41.816 --> 00:43:44.113
nuclear weaponry at the same time you're doing

978
00:43:44.113 --> 00:43:47.167
acoustic frequency research and development,

979
00:43:47.167 --> 00:43:49.863
with the same people, virtually, involved.

980
00:43:49.863 --> 00:43:52.806
With the same funding agencies and the same intention

981
00:43:52.806 --> 00:43:54.494
to use this for war,

982
00:43:54.494 --> 00:43:58.058
and for literally dividing people.

983
00:43:58.058 --> 00:44:00.623
'Cause that's what they do, to create their wars.

984
00:44:00.623 --> 00:44:04.455
Then you would want to focus in on the maximum

985
00:44:04.455 --> 00:44:08.238
population manipulation spiritual repression.

986
00:44:08.238 --> 00:44:10.542
And that's what A440 hertz frequency is.

987
00:44:10.542 --> 00:44:11.719
<v ->And not only that,</v>

988
00:44:11.719 --> 00:44:14.035
because it's popularized throughout culture,

989
00:44:14.035 --> 00:44:15.894
we take it on voluntarily.

990
00:44:15.894 --> 00:44:17.377
<v ->Through the Western world.</v>

991
00:44:17.377 --> 00:44:18.047
<v ->Yes.</v>

992
00:44:18.047 --> 00:44:20.179
<v ->Thankfully, the native populations,</v>

993
00:44:20.179 --> 00:44:21.745
the Aboriginals,

994
00:44:21.745 --> 00:44:24.907
the music makers in those tribes

995
00:44:24.907 --> 00:44:27.334
have rejected the A440 standard tuning.

996
00:44:27.334 --> 00:44:29.261
They still make their instruments and they still

997
00:44:29.261 --> 00:44:32.448
bring their voices to the A444

998
00:44:32.448 --> 00:44:34.518
or C528 frequency,

999
00:44:34.518 --> 00:44:37.327
and that's why so many of the healers now,

1000
00:44:37.327 --> 00:44:40.225
we have a whole revolution in the music industry right now.

1001
00:44:40.225 --> 00:44:41.542
Led by the healers

1002
00:44:41.542 --> 00:44:44.474
and the topic of my presentation is

1003
00:44:44.474 --> 00:44:47.131
can musicians save the world?

1004
00:44:47.131 --> 00:44:48.804
Can music save the world?

1005
00:44:48.804 --> 00:44:50.414
The answer I already know.

1006
00:44:50.414 --> 00:44:51.649
The answer is yes.

1007
00:44:51.649 --> 00:44:53.132
Because we are the music.

1008
00:44:53.132 --> 00:44:54.775
We source from music.

1009
00:44:54.775 --> 00:44:58.008
So to optimally sustain, uplift, and heal ourselves

1010
00:44:58.008 --> 00:44:59.387
and our planet,

1011
00:44:59.387 --> 00:45:01.793
all we have to do is look at a blade of grass,

1012
00:45:01.793 --> 00:45:06.082
and integrate the wisdom and the divine intelligence

1013
00:45:06.082 --> 00:45:08.341
that a blade of grass demonstrates

1014
00:45:08.341 --> 00:45:10.588
by growing into the light,

1015
00:45:10.588 --> 00:45:13.284
in this specific frequency of 528.

1016
00:45:13.284 --> 00:45:14.725
<v ->Green.
<v ->Green.</v>

1017
00:45:14.741 --> 00:45:16.553
<v ->Color of heart chakra energy, yeah.</v>

1018
00:45:16.553 --> 00:45:18.660
<v ->The whole botanical world gets it, pretty much.</v>

1019
00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:19.963
Most of the botanical world.

1020
00:45:19.963 --> 00:45:21.613
And when you think about energy,

1021
00:45:21.613 --> 00:45:24.010
think about where is the source of our energy.

1022
00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:25.502
All energy,

1023
00:45:25.502 --> 00:45:27.318
whether it's the blinking of your eye,

1024
00:45:27.318 --> 00:45:29.768
or whether it's the electrical

1025
00:45:30.063 --> 00:45:33.524
currents, copper wire, in the alternating currents.

1026
00:45:33.524 --> 00:45:34.830
It's all electrons.

1027
00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:35.597
<v ->Yes.</v>

1028
00:45:35.597 --> 00:45:38.107
<v ->And all of the electrons source from the same source,</v>

1029
00:45:38.107 --> 00:45:39.185
water.

1030
00:45:39.185 --> 00:45:41.893
H+ plus OH- is the equation.

1031
00:45:41.893 --> 00:45:45.631
H+ indicates a electron has been donated.

1032
00:45:45.631 --> 00:45:48.147
And that electron is vibrating,

1033
00:45:48.147 --> 00:45:51.278
and the vibration of that electron, in nature,

1034
00:45:51.278 --> 00:45:53.844
optimally, most energetically,

1035
00:45:53.844 --> 00:45:55.897
is 528.

1036
00:45:55.897 --> 00:45:58.691
That's why the botanical world is mostly greenish-yellow.

1037
00:45:58.691 --> 00:46:00.491
<v ->And to validate what you said earlier</v>

1038
00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:03.911
when you were talking about the same characters

1039
00:46:03.911 --> 00:46:06.341
that were developing all these military applications

1040
00:46:06.341 --> 00:46:07.972
and agendas at the same time.

1041
00:46:07.972 --> 00:46:09.576
There was an interview done,

1042
00:46:09.576 --> 00:46:11.990
I believe it may have been even in the 1960s

1043
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:13.765
with, is his name John Todd?

1044
00:46:13.765 --> 00:46:15.743
I think it was John Todd.

1045
00:46:15.743 --> 00:46:17.544
Excuse me anybody listening if I'm wrong,

1046
00:46:17.544 --> 00:46:19.264
but you might just do a search on John Todd.

1047
00:46:19.264 --> 00:46:22.324
And it had to do with the Illuminati presence

1048
00:46:22.324 --> 00:46:25.017
in the musical industry.

1049
00:46:25.017 --> 00:46:26.926
Essentially what he was saying,

1050
00:46:26.926 --> 00:46:29.299
as someone who had defected from that realm,

1051
00:46:29.299 --> 00:46:32.738
is that there are temples

1052
00:46:32.738 --> 00:46:36.705
within studios of the large recording companies,

1053
00:46:36.705 --> 00:46:39.146
where they essentially bless,

1054
00:46:39.146 --> 00:46:42.089
under certain astrological conditions and so forth,

1055
00:46:42.089 --> 00:46:44.453
the music that goes out into the world.

1056
00:46:44.453 --> 00:46:47.946
Very highly energetically, manipulated and controlled

1057
00:46:47.946 --> 00:46:51.719
to certain frequencies to be released to the population

1058
00:46:51.719 --> 00:46:54.262
at very key times that we're receptive

1059
00:46:54.262 --> 00:46:56.565
to that particular imprint.

1060
00:46:56.565 --> 00:47:00.555
And that again, is in the world of modern music.

1061
00:47:00.555 --> 00:47:02.371
This doesn't have to do with classical,

1062
00:47:02.371 --> 00:47:04.148
this is modern releases all the way through

1063
00:47:04.148 --> 00:47:05.460
hip hop, rap, you name it.

1064
00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:07.679
<v ->It makes complete sense that they would do that</v>

1065
00:47:07.679 --> 00:47:09.924
given all the evidence that we now have.

1066
00:47:09.924 --> 00:47:11.059
<v ->I'm just adding that in</v>

1067
00:47:11.059 --> 00:47:12.611
if anyone wants to do a search on it.

1068
00:47:12.611 --> 00:47:14.343
I found that very intriguing.

1069
00:47:14.343 --> 00:47:16.244
That the Illuminati would be,

1070
00:47:16.244 --> 00:47:17.650
I say Illuminati loosely,

1071
00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:19.230
we know what we mean, the cabal,

1072
00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:22.706
would be so interested in it, to have that practice there.

1073
00:47:22.706 --> 00:47:24.370
<v ->Because again, it's not against flesh and blood</v>

1074
00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:25.254
with whom we do battles.

1075
00:47:25.254 --> 00:47:27.308
Spirit is energy.

1076
00:47:27.308 --> 00:47:29.429
Energy's electromagnetic frequency.

1077
00:47:29.429 --> 00:47:31.509
So if you wanna dominate the planet,

1078
00:47:31.509 --> 00:47:33.173
you wanna dominate the human race,

1079
00:47:33.173 --> 00:47:35.682
you wanna control that, and manipulate them,

1080
00:47:35.682 --> 00:47:37.874
and coerce them optimally,

1081
00:47:37.874 --> 00:47:40.000
you've gotta engage frequency.

1082
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.892
Sound, acoustic science.

1083
00:47:41.892 --> 00:47:44.506
That's why it was ongoing with these major

1084
00:47:44.506 --> 00:47:46.504
movers and shakers that were advancing

1085
00:47:46.504 --> 00:47:48.236
the Manhattan Project were involved

1086
00:47:48.236 --> 00:47:49.630
with the acoustic science manipulation.

1087
00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:51.257
<v ->You played a little clip yesterday that was</v>

1088
00:47:51.257 --> 00:47:52.810
of the 528 frequency,

1089
00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:54.945
and you can feel it, and you can recognize it.

1090
00:47:54.945 --> 00:47:56.346
And when we hear these beautiful

1091
00:47:56.346 --> 00:47:57.876
Native American flute pieces,

1092
00:47:57.876 --> 00:47:59.211
we can feel.

1093
00:47:59.211 --> 00:48:01.431
Like you say, this is leading the way in the healing music

1094
00:48:01.431 --> 00:48:02.573
of the planet.

1095
00:48:02.573 --> 00:48:05.796
A lot of it is the indigenous music of the planet

1096
00:48:05.796 --> 00:48:08.987
in these very native, natural instruments.

1097
00:48:08.987 --> 00:48:11.242
And you recognize it immediately.

1098
00:48:11.242 --> 00:48:12.776
Your body feels it.

1099
00:48:12.776 --> 00:48:15.755
There is a sense of joy, and all is well,

1100
00:48:15.755 --> 00:48:18.365
and upliftment, and soothing and calming.

1101
00:48:18.365 --> 00:48:21.552
So you're taking this on by creating

1102
00:48:21.552 --> 00:48:24.487
a kind of alternative iTunes, as it were, right?

1103
00:48:24.487 --> 00:48:25.535
<v ->Right.</v>

1104
00:48:25.535 --> 00:48:29.397
That's what 528records.com is.

1105
00:48:29.397 --> 00:48:32.042
It's an alternative to iTunes.

1106
00:48:32.042 --> 00:48:34.705
In essence what it allows people to do

1107
00:48:34.705 --> 00:48:37.288
is upload their favorite music,

1108
00:48:37.288 --> 00:48:39.017
which is in 440,

1109
00:48:39.017 --> 00:48:42.026
into transposing it to 528.

1110
00:48:42.026 --> 00:48:44.827
They get a download of their favorite music,

1111
00:48:44.827 --> 00:48:47.571
and it's gonna be about 99 cents, by donation.

1112
00:48:47.571 --> 00:48:48.944
This is all donation

1113
00:48:48.944 --> 00:48:50.497
and collaboration.

1114
00:48:50.497 --> 00:48:52.284
People who are like-hearted,

1115
00:48:52.284 --> 00:48:56.153
in understanding now that we can literally transform

1116
00:48:56.153 --> 00:48:57.481
not just our bodies,

1117
00:48:57.481 --> 00:48:59.474
because if you think about the metaphor

1118
00:48:59.474 --> 00:49:02.018
of a pebble thrown into a pond,

1119
00:49:02.018 --> 00:49:05.674
and the waves go out to the farthest shores.

1120
00:49:05.674 --> 00:49:06.936
That's what happens.

1121
00:49:06.936 --> 00:49:09.487
The more of us that start to play

1122
00:49:09.487 --> 00:49:12.983
A444 or 528, right?

1123
00:49:12.983 --> 00:49:16.171
That music is going to ripple out because this is a

1124
00:49:16.171 --> 00:49:17.798
hydrated atmosphere.

1125
00:49:17.798 --> 00:49:20.493
And water, again, is a superconductor of sound.

1126
00:49:20.493 --> 00:49:22.392
So the more that we can put out

1127
00:49:22.392 --> 00:49:24.347
this love frequency vibration

1128
00:49:24.347 --> 00:49:27.648
in association with what's already happening,

1129
00:49:27.648 --> 00:49:29.374
the spiritual renaissance.

1130
00:49:29.374 --> 00:49:33.044
There's an exponential acceleration of our consciousness

1131
00:49:33.044 --> 00:49:34.213
and awareness,

1132
00:49:34.213 --> 00:49:35.543
and our love

1133
00:49:35.543 --> 00:49:38.118
for ultimately creating a peaceful planet.

1134
00:49:38.118 --> 00:49:39.572
And healing ourselves

1135
00:49:39.572 --> 00:49:41.724
of all of the poisons that we've been--

1136
00:49:41.724 --> 00:49:44.479
<v ->Is this a software of sorts,</v>

1137
00:49:44.479 --> 00:49:46.949
through acoustical physicist

1138
00:49:46.949 --> 00:49:49.989
they put together that you run the frequency through

1139
00:49:49.989 --> 00:49:54.181
and it simply brings it up to, as we say,

1140
00:49:54.181 --> 00:49:56.974
just those 4 hertz up to the next frequency

1141
00:49:56.974 --> 00:49:59.377
so that it's now coherent with your system?

1142
00:49:59.377 --> 00:50:00.774
<v ->That's exactly right.</v>

1143
00:50:00.774 --> 00:50:02.631
And it was so hard to find these guys.

1144
00:50:02.631 --> 00:50:04.461
I had to do a search worldwide.

1145
00:50:04.461 --> 00:50:06.195
There was no one in the United States

1146
00:50:06.195 --> 00:50:09.268
who had the background in acoustics

1147
00:50:09.268 --> 00:50:11.486
and the physics and the understanding

1148
00:50:11.486 --> 00:50:14.467
of the electromagnetic frequency vibrations,

1149
00:50:14.467 --> 00:50:16.498
and software development,

1150
00:50:16.498 --> 00:50:19.048
that could actually develop this technology.

1151
00:50:19.048 --> 00:50:20.035
But we got it,

1152
00:50:20.035 --> 00:50:21.144
in Russia.

1153
00:50:21.144 --> 00:50:24.122
So we're actually partnered with a group from Russia,

1154
00:50:24.122 --> 00:50:27.131
of developers who love this concept,

1155
00:50:27.131 --> 00:50:30.618
who understand it as we do,

1156
00:50:30.618 --> 00:50:34.349
as a heartfelt humanitarian contribution.

1157
00:50:34.349 --> 00:50:37.802
Because literally, this is the most important

1158
00:50:37.802 --> 00:50:41.630
revelation in technology to set us free.

1159
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:43.553
Freeing us with music.

1160
00:50:44.445 --> 00:50:47.588
The best metaphor is go back and watch

1161
00:50:47.588 --> 00:50:50.082
the Beatles' Yellow Submarine.

1162
00:50:50.082 --> 00:50:53.458
It's a story of how this magnificent community

1163
00:50:53.458 --> 00:50:56.106
of Pepperlanders, are creative

1164
00:50:56.106 --> 00:50:58.607
and they're engaged in music and arts.

1165
00:50:58.607 --> 00:51:01.527
And they're colorful, and alive, and vibrant,

1166
00:51:01.527 --> 00:51:03.235
and creative, and artistic,

1167
00:51:03.235 --> 00:51:06.907
and here's what happens is the Blue Meanies come suddenly.

1168
00:51:08.063 --> 00:51:11.318
First thing they do is they silence the music.

1169
00:51:11.318 --> 00:51:14.902
And they put all of the musical instruments in prison.

1170
00:51:15.088 --> 00:51:18.799
And the people who are now fully enlivened,

1171
00:51:18.799 --> 00:51:21.463
turned to fragile black and white.

1172
00:51:21.463 --> 00:51:25.746
And the Blue Meanies drop these little green apple bombs,

1173
00:51:25.746 --> 00:51:29.594
that then the vibrations shatter the Pepperlanders,

1174
00:51:29.594 --> 00:51:31.696
'cause they're froze in black and white now.

1175
00:51:31.696 --> 00:51:33.258
And the one guy that escapes,

1176
00:51:33.258 --> 00:51:35.560
the captain of the Yellow Submarine goes into the future,

1177
00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:37.506
gets the Beatles that come back.

1178
00:51:37.506 --> 00:51:40.825
First thing they do is emancipate the musical instruments

1179
00:51:40.825 --> 00:51:42.086
from prison.

1180
00:51:42.086 --> 00:51:43.895
They get the instruments back out,

1181
00:51:43.895 --> 00:51:45.241
they give it to the people,

1182
00:51:45.241 --> 00:51:47.565
the people start playing the music again,

1183
00:51:47.565 --> 00:51:50.400
and the Blue Meanies can't stand the music.

1184
00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.591
So they run, they run away.

1185
00:51:52.591 --> 00:51:54.657
And that's what we're doing here.

1186
00:51:54.657 --> 00:51:58.517
The more people that play C528 music,

1187
00:51:58.517 --> 00:52:01.234
that energy, that vibration is gonna go out and touch

1188
00:52:01.234 --> 00:52:02.871
everyone's heart.

1189
00:52:02.871 --> 00:52:05.603
And as everyone's heart starts to open up

1190
00:52:05.603 --> 00:52:07.097
and be uplifted with

1191
00:52:07.097 --> 00:52:10.685
what all of nature already vibrates to,

1192
00:52:10.967 --> 00:52:12.986
then we come into communion with nature.

1193
00:52:12.986 --> 00:52:14.732
We're no longer manipulating nature,

1194
00:52:14.732 --> 00:52:16.959
we're no longer in our egoic brains,

1195
00:52:16.959 --> 00:52:19.634
manipulated there by 440.

1196
00:52:19.634 --> 00:52:22.619
We're now engaged in heartfelt, loving interaction,

1197
00:52:22.619 --> 00:52:24.775
optimally divine human communion

1198
00:52:24.775 --> 00:52:27.348
available to we the people, the masses,

1199
00:52:27.348 --> 00:52:29.318
right here, right now.

1200
00:52:29.318 --> 00:52:31.156
Suddenly now you have a whole transformation,

1201
00:52:31.156 --> 00:52:32.777
the whole paradigm shifts,

1202
00:52:32.777 --> 00:52:35.255
from chemical manipulation

1203
00:52:35.255 --> 00:52:37.905
into spiritual renaissance.

1204
00:52:38.138 --> 00:52:40.790
<v ->Well, I can't think of any better note to close on.</v>

1205
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:41.970
Thank you so much, Leonard,

1206
00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:43.485
for taking time to talk to us today.

1207
00:52:43.485 --> 00:52:44.673
<v ->Thanks, Regina.</v>

1208
00:52:44.673 --> 00:52:46.838
Appreciate the opportunity.

1209
00:52:48.736 --> 00:52:51.423
<v ->To learn more about the love 528 frequency,</v>

1210
00:52:51.423 --> 00:52:52.902
you can go to Leonard's website

1211
00:52:52.902 --> 00:52:54.750
at tetrahedron.org.

1212
00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:57.249
You'll also find books and videos on vaccines,

1213
00:52:57.249 --> 00:52:59.567
and information about his product OXYSILVER

1214
00:52:59.567 --> 00:53:00.802
for those interested.

1215
00:53:00.802 --> 00:53:03.983
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1216
00:53:05.426 --> 00:53:09.459
(surreal techno music)
