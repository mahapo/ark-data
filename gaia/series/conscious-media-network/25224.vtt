00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.734
(smooth music)

2
00:00:12.384 --> 00:00:14.870
<v ->One of the real enigmas within the history of science</v>

3
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.038
is that the original members of the British Royal Society,

4
00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:20.075
men such as Isaac Newton,

5
00:00:20.075 --> 00:00:22.705
were what author Peter Taylor calls alchemists,

6
00:00:22.705 --> 00:00:25.345
who possessed highly refined levels of knowledge.

7
00:00:25.345 --> 00:00:28.369
Rather than imparting this knowledge to the masses, however,

8
00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.022
they gave birth to what we know

9
00:00:30.022 --> 00:00:31.836
today as the traditional sciences,

10
00:00:31.836 --> 00:00:34.284
and other disciplines that were much more limited

11
00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:37.068
in what they themselves knew to be true.

12
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:54.331
Peter, we had a conversation with another author,

13
00:00:54.331 --> 00:00:56.742
Lucy Wyatt, and we were starting to get

14
00:00:56.742 --> 00:00:58.854
into some very interesting areas.

15
00:00:58.854 --> 00:01:00.699
She wrote the book, Approaching Chaos,

16
00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.435
and she said, "No, we haven't gotten into the subject

17
00:01:03.435 --> 00:01:06.843
"of alchemy and how this eventually

18
00:01:06.843 --> 00:01:08.545
"gave way to modern science."

19
00:01:08.545 --> 00:01:10.849
I thought, whoopee, let's just pick our conversation

20
00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:14.007
up with Peter at this point, because I think

21
00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:16.599
it's almost a continued conversation that way.

22
00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:20.823
So we had had an off-camera conversation about this before

23
00:01:20.823 --> 00:01:23.991
and I thought this is a direction I'd like to go,

24
00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:26.919
which is going back to the Royal Society

25
00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:29.129
and some of the most famous names in,

26
00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:33.017
quote, modern science, including Newton,

27
00:01:33.017 --> 00:01:34.927
and I would like you to reveal to us

28
00:01:34.927 --> 00:01:37.423
what you have put together regarding this story

29
00:01:37.423 --> 00:01:41.023
of how these alchemists essentially foisted modern science

30
00:01:41.023 --> 00:01:43.903
upon the rest of us which is so incredibly restrictive.

31
00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:46.554
<v ->It's a very recent conclusion,</v>

32
00:01:46.554 --> 00:01:48.810
that that's what's happened.

33
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.280
First of all, I didn't know that

34
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.395
the founders of the Royal Society

35
00:01:53.395 --> 00:01:57.131
were essentially what we would call magicians.

36
00:01:57.131 --> 00:01:59.473
I didn't even know what alchemists were.

37
00:01:59.473 --> 00:02:03.169
I went through a very straight scientific education,

38
00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:07.009
the best there is in this country, Oxford.

39
00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.185
And so, there's a museum in the university town,

40
00:02:11.185 --> 00:02:13.681
called the Ashmolean Museum,

41
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:18.066
and it's only in very recent times

42
00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:20.518
that I thought,

43
00:02:20.518 --> 00:02:25.506
well, the founders of modern science were all alchemists,

44
00:02:25.506 --> 00:02:28.760
and I didn't even know what an alchemist was,

45
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.984
and I was attracted to a biography of Elias Ashmolean,

46
00:02:32.984 --> 00:02:35.384
who founded the museum but also

47
00:02:35.384 --> 00:02:39.080
was one of the founding fathers of the Royal Society.

48
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.203
I was intrigued reading this biography,

49
00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:44.888
that he was an alchemist,

50
00:02:44.888 --> 00:02:49.544
and in comparison to when I was a student,

51
00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:51.677
to where I am now, where I've been through

52
00:02:51.677 --> 00:02:54.787
an esoteric training as well as a scientific training,

53
00:02:54.787 --> 00:02:58.675
I now know that the alchemists were practicing esoteric,

54
00:02:58.675 --> 00:03:03.523
that is, inner knowledge, and part of that

55
00:03:03.523 --> 00:03:06.019
whole process, the alchemical marriage,

56
00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.147
was what, from my yogic lineage, would be called tantra.

57
00:03:10.147 --> 00:03:12.942
And so, with tantra, you're, again,

58
00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:15.735
looking at an inner journey,

59
00:03:15.735 --> 00:03:20.045
facilitated by a partner, female partners,

60
00:03:20.045 --> 00:03:23.501
there's a male-female, and that it was intriguing

61
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:26.813
reading the biography of this man who,

62
00:03:26.813 --> 00:03:30.664
whose marriage was failing, and yet his wife

63
00:03:30.664 --> 00:03:35.270
was his alchemical partner in this inner journey.

64
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.339
And that, within the biography,

65
00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:40.700
Elias Ashmolean joins

66
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.729
with several other alchemists

67
00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:49.455
who then leave alchemy, essentially, almost like

68
00:03:49.455 --> 00:03:53.093
giving up on the whole alchemical journey,

69
00:03:53.093 --> 00:03:55.864
it wasn't working with the women.

70
00:03:55.864 --> 00:03:57.713
That's very obvious from the biography,

71
00:03:57.713 --> 00:03:59.297
it wasn't working with women.

72
00:03:59.297 --> 00:04:01.815
And they joined the Freemasons.

73
00:04:01.815 --> 00:04:03.978
<v Regina>No girls allowed?</v>

74
00:04:03.978 --> 00:04:06.327
<v ->No girls allowed, you don't need women</v>

75
00:04:06.327 --> 00:04:08.429
in order to do this inner journey.

76
00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:12.856
Now, quite what they do do is kind of secret,

77
00:04:12.856 --> 00:04:16.120
and having clashed quite strongly

78
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.672
with the scientific establishment, in my work,

79
00:04:19.672 --> 00:04:23.464
as an ecologist, having clashed with them on issues

80
00:04:23.464 --> 00:04:26.680
of nuclear power, nuclear risks,

81
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.952
genetic modification, recently on climate change,

82
00:04:30.952 --> 00:04:35.560
I'm coming up against organized science.

83
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.278
It isn't just the science of inquiry,

84
00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:42.782
this is also the science of influencing government,

85
00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:44.702
the science of--

86
00:04:44.702 --> 00:04:48.830
it's very interesting, when Eisenhower warned,

87
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.105
shortly after the Second World War,

88
00:04:52.105 --> 00:04:54.553
about the military industrial complex

89
00:04:54.553 --> 00:04:58.636
driving foreign policy, creating wars, effectively,

90
00:04:58.636 --> 00:05:03.193
he also warned, in parallel to that, in the same speech,

91
00:05:03.193 --> 00:05:06.889
that science would one day dictate policy.

92
00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.769
And what he was meaning is that what he had seen

93
00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:12.804
was that scientists were becoming highly organized,

94
00:05:12.804 --> 00:05:15.972
they were becoming instruments of the political process.

95
00:05:15.972 --> 00:05:18.573
<v Regina>Which is, we know with the story</v>

96
00:05:18.573 --> 00:05:20.552
of global change, climate change.

97
00:05:20.552 --> 00:05:23.134
<v ->You see it in the pharmaceutical industry,</v>

98
00:05:23.134 --> 00:05:26.758
where medical science comes up with a supposed remedy

99
00:05:26.758 --> 00:05:31.754
for problems, but actually within that policy

100
00:05:31.754 --> 00:05:34.336
is generated a roll-through,

101
00:05:34.336 --> 00:05:36.976
not in the scientists but their pay-masters,

102
00:05:36.976 --> 00:05:39.446
the pharmaceutical industry.

103
00:05:39.446 --> 00:05:42.758
So something like, for example, a solution to AIDS

104
00:05:42.758 --> 00:05:46.692
is seen as a retroviral drug,

105
00:05:46.692 --> 00:05:48.799
which has to be produced,

106
00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:51.093
so the philanthropists give them money

107
00:05:51.093 --> 00:05:52.842
to the pharmaceutical industry to solve

108
00:05:52.842 --> 00:05:55.232
a humanitarian problem, which is actually

109
00:05:55.232 --> 00:05:58.352
very largely created by an economic structure,

110
00:05:58.352 --> 00:06:00.629
men who are forced to, in Africa,

111
00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:04.229
forced to leave their villages to work in the cities

112
00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.533
and come back and contaminate the women.

113
00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:09.787
That's as much an economic creation

114
00:06:09.787 --> 00:06:14.395
of the viral problem, the epidemic, as the virus itself.

115
00:06:14.395 --> 00:06:18.091
So, again, science sees things in particular ways,

116
00:06:18.091 --> 00:06:20.161
the war on drugs, the war on cancer.

117
00:06:20.161 --> 00:06:21.745
<v Regina>And it drives policy now, too.</v>

118
00:06:21.745 --> 00:06:22.887
<v ->It drives policy.</v>

119
00:06:22.887 --> 00:06:25.143
And likewise, the world climate,

120
00:06:25.143 --> 00:06:27.927
where do you see that term, "war on?"

121
00:06:27.927 --> 00:06:31.194
You have to look behind the scenes as to who benefits.

122
00:06:31.194 --> 00:06:35.093
So science is really, in this age, is compromised.

123
00:06:35.093 --> 00:06:38.653
Original science, at the time of the alchemists,

124
00:06:38.653 --> 00:06:41.965
was a genuine inquiry.

125
00:06:41.965 --> 00:06:44.965
Now, what fascinated me was

126
00:06:44.965 --> 00:06:48.658
why a group of magicians

127
00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:51.864
would construct a body of knowledge

128
00:06:51.864 --> 00:06:53.928
that essentially was saying,

129
00:06:53.928 --> 00:06:56.291
the only valid reality is external.

130
00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:59.171
<v Regina>Which is interesting, because if you read,</v>

131
00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:01.667
even with Isaac Newton, there's a lot of,

132
00:07:01.667 --> 00:07:04.616
there are a lot of mystical elements to his writings,

133
00:07:04.616 --> 00:07:07.678
that he eventually came forth with as well.

134
00:07:07.678 --> 00:07:11.491
<v ->Indeed, and Newton, in addition</v>

135
00:07:11.491 --> 00:07:14.793
to being an alchemist, or having that connection,

136
00:07:14.793 --> 00:07:16.473
was also an astrologer.

137
00:07:16.473 --> 00:07:19.962
And I'm also an astrologer,

138
00:07:19.962 --> 00:07:22.859
and as I work

139
00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:26.411
in the political world, in relation to policy,

140
00:07:26.411 --> 00:07:29.243
I have to, up until very recently,

141
00:07:29.243 --> 00:07:32.805
I have to keep my other world,

142
00:07:32.805 --> 00:07:36.793
as a yogi, a healer, a shaman, or an astrologer,

143
00:07:36.793 --> 00:07:39.433
completely under wraps, because then

144
00:07:39.433 --> 00:07:43.177
I'm totally discredited, how can you, this guy, you know?

145
00:07:43.177 --> 00:07:45.565
"He's an astrologer," they laugh.

146
00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:48.637
And if I were to mention astrological realities

147
00:07:48.637 --> 00:07:51.997
in certain fora, they'd walk out.

148
00:07:51.997 --> 00:07:54.817
<v Regina>Yeah, they can speak of Sir Isaac Newton.</v>

149
00:07:54.817 --> 00:07:56.257
<v ->But they can speak of Newton.</v>

150
00:07:56.257 --> 00:08:00.231
And so they tend to view alchemy and astrology

151
00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:04.551
as some quaint habit that the early scientists had,

152
00:08:04.551 --> 00:08:07.239
because there hadn't been this separation

153
00:08:07.239 --> 00:08:11.653
between religion and science at that time.

154
00:08:12.931 --> 00:08:16.185
I've recently thought, no, this isn't

155
00:08:16.185 --> 00:08:19.275
a good enough explanation because, if you look,

156
00:08:19.275 --> 00:08:22.923
to look at it from a sociological perspective,

157
00:08:22.923 --> 00:08:25.269
the birth of science

158
00:08:25.269 --> 00:08:29.101
predates the industrial revolution,

159
00:08:29.101 --> 00:08:32.123
and everyone else looks at the industrial revolution

160
00:08:32.123 --> 00:08:34.477
as a revolution of technology,

161
00:08:34.477 --> 00:08:36.973
and then the Renaissance,

162
00:08:36.973 --> 00:08:41.501
and rational knowledge, but actually it was

163
00:08:41.501 --> 00:08:46.447
a huge social dislocation, of moving people

164
00:08:46.447 --> 00:08:50.673
from community and the land and connection

165
00:08:50.673 --> 00:08:53.445
into cities,

166
00:08:53.445 --> 00:08:56.805
and into jobs, and into industry,

167
00:08:56.805 --> 00:09:01.509
which, almost in any definition, would be soul destroying,

168
00:09:02.789 --> 00:09:06.719
that they lose so much in that transition,

169
00:09:06.719 --> 00:09:11.543
and I'll give them then money in exchange,

170
00:09:11.543 --> 00:09:15.305
they become wage slaves.

171
00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:17.033
<v Regina>Well, this is where we are today.</v>

172
00:09:17.033 --> 00:09:20.863
<v ->And indeed, for a good couple of hundred years or more,</v>

173
00:09:20.863 --> 00:09:23.309
after the birth of the Royal Society,

174
00:09:23.309 --> 00:09:26.237
you're essentially building an empire,

175
00:09:26.237 --> 00:09:29.599
built fundamentally on slavery.

176
00:09:29.599 --> 00:09:33.053
And so, when one reflects

177
00:09:33.053 --> 00:09:35.711
that, in order to make all of that work,

178
00:09:35.711 --> 00:09:38.493
you have to disenfranchise

179
00:09:38.493 --> 00:09:43.245
the ordinary human of much more than their land,

180
00:09:43.245 --> 00:09:46.691
you have to take away their personal authority,

181
00:09:46.691 --> 00:09:49.993
their personal creativity, their allegiance to soul,

182
00:09:49.993 --> 00:09:52.293
and that is done

183
00:09:52.293 --> 00:09:55.319
with what I now see as a magician's trick,

184
00:09:55.319 --> 00:09:59.159
and that is, you take them away from their inner world,

185
00:09:59.159 --> 00:10:03.369
and this inner journey, which is strengthening.

186
00:10:03.369 --> 00:10:06.363
In the tantric journey, in yoga, you move

187
00:10:06.363 --> 00:10:09.693
from the base chakra, through the sexual chakra,

188
00:10:09.693 --> 00:10:12.957
the power center, the heart, the throat,

189
00:10:12.957 --> 00:10:16.941
and in the way that I'm now teaching yoga,

190
00:10:16.941 --> 00:10:20.173
inside the base is all about security.

191
00:10:20.173 --> 00:10:23.055
If you have subtle thought patterns

192
00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:25.789
that leave you feeling insecure,

193
00:10:25.789 --> 00:10:28.623
"How am I going to pay the mortgage?

194
00:10:28.623 --> 00:10:31.455
"Is my job secure, where do I belong?

195
00:10:31.455 --> 00:10:33.169
"How am I going to feed my children?"

196
00:10:33.169 --> 00:10:34.707
<v Regina>Which is where the vast percentage</v>

197
00:10:34.707 --> 00:10:36.817
of the population of this planet lives now.

198
00:10:36.817 --> 00:10:38.553
<v ->It is, not only does it live in that way,</v>

199
00:10:38.553 --> 00:10:42.009
but it's actually, the whole system is promulgated

200
00:10:42.009 --> 00:10:44.843
to make people feel secure.

201
00:10:44.843 --> 00:10:47.963
So you have the bizarre phenomenon

202
00:10:47.963 --> 00:10:50.813
of the most powerful nation on the planet,

203
00:10:50.813 --> 00:10:55.181
armed to the teeth, feeling incredibly insecure,

204
00:10:55.181 --> 00:10:59.789
and its population having a natural insecurity,

205
00:10:59.789 --> 00:11:01.771
for the most part,

206
00:11:01.771 --> 00:11:05.361
then projecting its fear

207
00:11:05.361 --> 00:11:08.385
as its shadow, and then oddly enough,

208
00:11:08.385 --> 00:11:11.601
its shadow then manifesting Al Qaeda,

209
00:11:11.601 --> 00:11:14.769
which I understand from the Arabic means "the base."

210
00:11:14.769 --> 00:11:17.025
So it projects its insecurity.

211
00:11:17.025 --> 00:11:20.433
Then its projected shadow comes and hits it,

212
00:11:20.433 --> 00:11:23.073
and you can see that as unconscious.

213
00:11:23.073 --> 00:11:25.117
On the other hand, you can also see it

214
00:11:25.117 --> 00:11:28.081
as conscious as well, because it serves

215
00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:30.499
the power structure that's built up

216
00:11:30.499 --> 00:11:32.793
through the industrial revolution,

217
00:11:32.793 --> 00:11:36.873
it serves that power structure to create an external enemy.

218
00:11:36.873 --> 00:11:38.889
<v Regina>Well, and if you go into conspiracy,</v>

219
00:11:38.889 --> 00:11:40.569
you can say it's very consciously intended

220
00:11:40.569 --> 00:11:43.017
that that relationship came to be,

221
00:11:43.017 --> 00:11:45.321
so that it could continue to perpetuate

222
00:11:45.321 --> 00:11:47.125
this fear and anxiety and insecurity

223
00:11:47.125 --> 00:11:48.487
to buy into another agenda.

224
00:11:48.487 --> 00:11:51.415
<v ->And you've only got to look at 9/11 to know that,</v>

225
00:11:51.415 --> 00:11:55.319
looking at it purely scientifically, rationally,

226
00:11:55.319 --> 00:11:58.009
it's a perfectly rational judgement to make,

227
00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:00.407
to say there's something fishy about this.

228
00:12:00.407 --> 00:12:02.461
<v Regina>Yeah, absolutely, and there's so much on that,</v>

229
00:12:02.461 --> 00:12:03.803
we don't even need to go there,

230
00:12:03.803 --> 00:12:07.171
because I think most of the people watching understand that.

231
00:12:07.171 --> 00:12:10.529
<v ->If I were to even mention the possibility</v>

232
00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:12.825
of an inside job, in relation to 9/11,

233
00:12:12.825 --> 00:12:14.647
I would be totally discredited.

234
00:12:14.647 --> 00:12:16.519
<v Regina>In England?</v>
<v Peter>In England, yeah.</v>

235
00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:20.647
Within the circles that I would normally work in,

236
00:12:20.647 --> 00:12:25.207
that would be, "Oh, my goodness, conspiracy nut."

237
00:12:25.207 --> 00:12:28.605
But actually it's a perfectly rational inquiry,

238
00:12:28.605 --> 00:12:30.829
and to look, well, who benefits?

239
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:32.583
<v Regina>Exactly, it serves a higher,</v>

240
00:12:32.583 --> 00:12:35.703
I'm not saying better, it serves a larger agenda.

241
00:12:35.703 --> 00:12:37.769
<v ->And so, for example, politically,</v>

242
00:12:37.769 --> 00:12:41.847
if you did not know, when Tony Blair was first elected,

243
00:12:41.847 --> 00:12:45.111
everyone was like, oh, incredibly hopeful with this man.

244
00:12:45.111 --> 00:12:49.487
Now his reputation is very low,

245
00:12:49.487 --> 00:12:54.287
and people feel deceived and betrayed.

246
00:12:54.287 --> 00:12:57.183
And he started out with kind of this

247
00:12:57.183 --> 00:12:59.679
socialist humanitarian perspective,

248
00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:03.709
but within the first week, and I voted for him,

249
00:13:03.709 --> 00:13:08.413
I see him go and embrace the prime minister of Italy.

250
00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:12.879
Now, 20 years ago, the prime minister of Italy

251
00:13:12.879 --> 00:13:16.767
wasn't in politics, he was a media mogul,

252
00:13:16.767 --> 00:13:21.325
but he had a seat at the high table of a particular lodge,

253
00:13:21.325 --> 00:13:24.543
Propaganda Due or P2, which was broken open

254
00:13:24.543 --> 00:13:26.415
by the Italian magistrate.

255
00:13:26.415 --> 00:13:28.431
I had a particular interest in that time,

256
00:13:28.431 --> 00:13:32.117
because oddly enough, the mafia,

257
00:13:32.117 --> 00:13:36.389
the Italian mafia, they run the drugs industry,

258
00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:40.709
and trafficking, prostitution, all of that side of things,

259
00:13:40.709 --> 00:13:44.405
they also run the international toxic waste trade,

260
00:13:44.405 --> 00:13:47.477
and I worked for Greenpeace, and so we were

261
00:13:47.477 --> 00:13:50.837
tackling the waste trade, and it's like

262
00:13:50.837 --> 00:13:53.811
we were coming up against a very dark character,

263
00:13:53.811 --> 00:13:55.865
I said, "What's going on here?"

264
00:13:55.865 --> 00:13:59.033
And one of the great surprises for me was that

265
00:13:59.033 --> 00:14:02.297
the mafia sit at the same table

266
00:14:02.297 --> 00:14:05.431
as the bankers and the military,

267
00:14:05.431 --> 00:14:07.421
and this was one

268
00:14:07.421 --> 00:14:11.117
of the revelations of the P2 Lodge affair,

269
00:14:11.117 --> 00:14:15.743
was that sitting next to, you know, the God's banker,

270
00:14:15.743 --> 00:14:20.053
was Michele Sindona, a well known mafioso,

271
00:14:20.053 --> 00:14:22.545
and he was regularly seen

272
00:14:22.545 --> 00:14:24.945
at Bush Senior's ranch

273
00:14:24.945 --> 00:14:28.305
in the United States, so, this was common knowledge,

274
00:14:28.305 --> 00:14:31.087
breaking knowledge in the early 80s,

275
00:14:31.087 --> 00:14:34.591
and Silvia Berlusconi had a seat at that table.

276
00:14:34.591 --> 00:14:38.691
And so, it's like, now he's prime minister of Italy,

277
00:14:38.691 --> 00:14:41.811
and there's Tony Blair, embracing him

278
00:14:41.811 --> 00:14:44.547
as a personal friend and staying at his villa.

279
00:14:44.547 --> 00:14:49.083
So these kind of issues,

280
00:14:49.083 --> 00:14:52.123
to me, are sort of

281
00:14:52.123 --> 00:14:56.925
relatively politically uneducated scientists,

282
00:14:56.925 --> 00:14:59.277
but very concerned about the environment.

283
00:14:59.277 --> 00:15:01.485
I think, what on earth is going on here?

284
00:15:01.485 --> 00:15:05.301
And it's a similar perspective when you look

285
00:15:05.301 --> 00:15:08.183
at the birth of the Royal Society,

286
00:15:08.183 --> 00:15:12.501
and the current president of the Royal Society--

287
00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:14.171
<v Regina>Let's talk about that,</v>

288
00:15:14.171 --> 00:15:17.173
to inform the rest of the audience that's not British

289
00:15:17.173 --> 00:15:19.563
about the Royal Society, and what this means

290
00:15:19.563 --> 00:15:21.531
in a larger scheme of modern science

291
00:15:21.531 --> 00:15:24.077
and what we are laboring under.

292
00:15:24.077 --> 00:15:26.685
<v ->Yeah, well, this is perhaps the first</v>

293
00:15:26.685 --> 00:15:30.861
of the major science institutions, which has

294
00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:35.517
formed all of the other science institutions, in a way,

295
00:15:35.517 --> 00:15:39.575
and we've got to think that in 400 years,

296
00:15:39.575 --> 00:15:43.025
science has come to occupy

297
00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:44.945
such an incredible position,

298
00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:48.257
you have a chief scientific advisor to the government,

299
00:15:48.257 --> 00:15:50.465
you don't have a chief psychological advisor,

300
00:15:50.465 --> 00:15:54.497
or chief shamanic practitioner, or astrologer or whatever,

301
00:15:54.497 --> 00:15:56.485
unless you're Nancy Reagan.

302
00:15:56.485 --> 00:16:01.473
And so, science has come to occupy

303
00:16:01.473 --> 00:16:03.795
a very powerful position, to a point

304
00:16:03.795 --> 00:16:07.049
where it's actually revolutionized our educational system,

305
00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:11.657
and it sees itself as having validly

306
00:16:11.657 --> 00:16:15.449
replaced mumbo-jumbo religion.

307
00:16:15.449 --> 00:16:17.895
And it's very interesting that now,

308
00:16:17.895 --> 00:16:22.157
very recently, Stephen Hawking is talking about

309
00:16:22.157 --> 00:16:27.139
how the whole universe can be seen,

310
00:16:27.139 --> 00:16:31.613
perfectly adequately, as a sort of self-replicating,

311
00:16:31.613 --> 00:16:34.877
self-creating, self-assembling system.

312
00:16:34.877 --> 00:16:37.071
<v Regina>Yes, that got quite a bit</v>

313
00:16:37.071 --> 00:16:39.281
of airtime in the US, as well.

314
00:16:39.281 --> 00:16:40.913
<v ->And Richard Dawkins, as well,</v>

315
00:16:40.913 --> 00:16:44.033
this whole thing, the selfish gene, and so forth,

316
00:16:44.033 --> 00:16:45.923
and I'm looking and thinking,

317
00:16:45.923 --> 00:16:50.645
how can such incredibly intelligent people be so stupid?

318
00:16:50.645 --> 00:16:55.013
And the truth is, perhaps, those individuals

319
00:16:55.013 --> 00:16:58.707
may well be that naïve, but science itself isn't.

320
00:16:58.707 --> 00:17:01.529
These people are not that stupid.

321
00:17:01.529 --> 00:17:04.927
And we know that they are highly organized

322
00:17:04.927 --> 00:17:08.191
in secret societies, the top scientists,

323
00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:12.107
certain politicians, the banking,

324
00:17:12.107 --> 00:17:15.611
the legal fraternity, the judiciary, the police,

325
00:17:15.611 --> 00:17:18.267
we know that they belong to an esoteric,

326
00:17:18.267 --> 00:17:21.435
secret organization, called Freemasonry.

327
00:17:21.435 --> 00:17:25.515
But nobody investigates, you can't find out

328
00:17:25.515 --> 00:17:28.525
what are originals, and it's, again,

329
00:17:28.525 --> 00:17:31.633
it's just this sort of rotary club,

330
00:17:31.633 --> 00:17:34.561
but of course it isn't, it has a deep

331
00:17:34.561 --> 00:17:37.861
esoteric training and knowledge.

332
00:17:37.861 --> 00:17:41.509
And it's, in a way, replaced alchemy.

333
00:17:41.509 --> 00:17:45.445
And so, why is it that

334
00:17:45.445 --> 00:17:48.421
that has to remain secret?

335
00:17:48.421 --> 00:17:52.747
A few hundred years ago, you could be executed

336
00:17:52.747 --> 00:17:56.491
for that kind of an internal inquiry.

337
00:17:57.601 --> 00:17:59.903
<v Regina>Yet it was taking place at the highest levels</v>

338
00:17:59.903 --> 00:18:01.583
all along, and always has been.

339
00:18:01.583 --> 00:18:03.503
But it sounds as though there's still

340
00:18:04.543 --> 00:18:06.639
the need or desire on their part,

341
00:18:06.639 --> 00:18:10.625
the perceived need to essentially

342
00:18:10.625 --> 00:18:13.425
sequester that type of higher knowledge,

343
00:18:13.425 --> 00:18:15.249
only for their own purposes,

344
00:18:15.249 --> 00:18:17.363
and it's not to be distributed to the masses,

345
00:18:17.363 --> 00:18:19.043
because we'd be far less controllable

346
00:18:19.043 --> 00:18:21.251
if we had access to genuine knowledge.

347
00:18:21.251 --> 00:18:23.045
<v ->And not only that, I think we wouldn't</v>

348
00:18:23.045 --> 00:18:26.789
necessarily agree with their agenda.

349
00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:30.273
<v Regina>That's an extension of that, of course.</v>

350
00:18:30.273 --> 00:18:35.215
<v ->Tony Blair could not be elected if he simply said,</v>

351
00:18:35.215 --> 00:18:37.155
"Well, actually, I'm not a Christian,"

352
00:18:38.385 --> 00:18:41.469
and had no need to make some kind of front,

353
00:18:41.469 --> 00:18:43.485
that would join the Catholic church,

354
00:18:43.485 --> 00:18:46.075
but to say, and I'm not saying that he is

355
00:18:46.075 --> 00:18:48.813
enamored of this esoteric project, anyway,

356
00:18:48.813 --> 00:18:52.605
I don't know, but no politician would be able to say,

357
00:18:52.605 --> 00:18:57.501
"Well, I hold to a patriarchal universal

358
00:18:57.501 --> 00:19:00.399
"architectural figure, and we have all kinds

359
00:19:00.399 --> 00:19:03.039
"of rituals in relation to that."

360
00:19:03.039 --> 00:19:07.839
And the deeper esoteric journey, without women,

361
00:19:07.839 --> 00:19:11.727
is essentially also without feminine consciousness.

362
00:19:11.727 --> 00:19:16.191
And so this is the mess that they have led us into,

363
00:19:16.191 --> 00:19:18.639
where the planet is regarded

364
00:19:18.639 --> 00:19:21.855
as a natural resource that can be plundered,

365
00:19:21.855 --> 00:19:24.829
and we were having this conversation earlier,

366
00:19:24.829 --> 00:19:26.751
about what does nature mean?

367
00:19:26.751 --> 00:19:29.487
In the imperial language of English,

368
00:19:29.487 --> 00:19:32.529
our original language would have had a word

369
00:19:32.529 --> 00:19:35.409
for this environment, in the same way

370
00:19:35.409 --> 00:19:37.539
as any indigenous tribe would have a word,

371
00:19:37.539 --> 00:19:42.055
this is what has given us birth, this is our mother.

372
00:19:42.055 --> 00:19:45.605
And in the Latin, ironically enough,

373
00:19:45.605 --> 00:19:48.199
natura means "she who gives birth."

374
00:19:48.199 --> 00:19:50.855
So the word does mean, and so,

375
00:19:50.855 --> 00:19:54.119
we're not going to say, "Well, this is the department

376
00:19:54.119 --> 00:19:56.231
for the exploitation of the mother."

377
00:19:56.231 --> 00:19:59.947
This is the department of natural resources,

378
00:19:59.947 --> 00:20:03.345
and nature management, and all this.

379
00:20:03.345 --> 00:20:06.033
We have a different perspective.

380
00:20:06.033 --> 00:20:09.947
So science is part of a linguistic

381
00:20:09.947 --> 00:20:14.929
and magician, magical trick, to essentially

382
00:20:14.929 --> 00:20:18.433
separate people from their inner self,

383
00:20:18.433 --> 00:20:22.273
and make them much more easily manipulated,

384
00:20:22.273 --> 00:20:25.729
afraid, and then the modern culture

385
00:20:25.729 --> 00:20:30.729
of sexual dissipation, there's no training in tantra,

386
00:20:30.765 --> 00:20:33.635
and I rather suspect that one of the reasons

387
00:20:33.635 --> 00:20:36.563
those marriages were breaking down in 1600

388
00:20:36.563 --> 00:20:41.121
is you just had 400 years where all of the feminine teachers

389
00:20:41.121 --> 00:20:44.769
of knowledge had been executed in ritualistic way.

390
00:20:44.769 --> 00:20:48.057
And so, where would you find

391
00:20:48.057 --> 00:20:51.801
a woman of equal energetic power,

392
00:20:51.801 --> 00:20:55.833
who you could meet in tantric union, eye to eye?

393
00:20:55.833 --> 00:20:58.137
It just, it wasn't happening,

394
00:20:58.137 --> 00:21:02.649
and so the masonic universe is glad of that,

395
00:21:02.649 --> 00:21:05.959
because it sees the feminine as disorderly,

396
00:21:05.959 --> 00:21:08.377
and even, actually, even the Buddha

397
00:21:08.377 --> 00:21:11.161
had a problem with women on that level.

398
00:21:11.161 --> 00:21:13.579
<v Regina>A threat to its own existence.</v>

399
00:21:13.579 --> 00:21:17.143
<v ->And the threat to civilization itself.</v>

400
00:21:17.143 --> 00:21:19.099
And so,

401
00:21:19.099 --> 00:21:23.099
what we have to kind of retrieve

402
00:21:23.099 --> 00:21:25.955
is enormous, what we lost is enormous,

403
00:21:25.955 --> 00:21:29.447
we see our current civilization as so great,

404
00:21:29.447 --> 00:21:31.789
but actually, we've lost consciousness,

405
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:36.605
and the retrieval of that consciousness is a traumatic task.

406
00:21:36.605 --> 00:21:39.619
<v Regina>And you sit in an interesting position,</v>

407
00:21:39.619 --> 00:21:42.787
as you mentioned earlier, you have a foot in both worlds,

408
00:21:42.787 --> 00:21:44.899
but the foot that is in this world

409
00:21:44.899 --> 00:21:48.739
goes into this world at a fairly high level in board rooms.

410
00:21:48.739 --> 00:21:50.485
<v ->Recently, yes.</v>

411
00:21:50.485 --> 00:21:54.181
<v Regina>And there's something you told us off-camera</v>

412
00:21:54.181 --> 00:21:57.527
that I found interesting, and that was you had

413
00:21:57.527 --> 00:21:59.687
recently set foot in one of these board rooms,

414
00:21:59.687 --> 00:22:02.017
and where you had felt this

415
00:22:02.017 --> 00:22:06.681
very, almost kind of dark presence in times past.

416
00:22:06.681 --> 00:22:08.841
That wasn't there this time.

417
00:22:08.841 --> 00:22:10.571
Now, this is something interesting.

418
00:22:10.571 --> 00:22:12.395
<v ->Yeah, this was a great surprise to me.</v>

419
00:22:12.395 --> 00:22:15.697
Although I wasn't conscious, 20 years ago,

420
00:22:15.697 --> 00:22:19.153
of what was propelling me into the top

421
00:22:19.153 --> 00:22:22.465
of the skyscrapers in the city, for example,

422
00:22:22.465 --> 00:22:25.267
there I was there, avowed enemy,

423
00:22:25.267 --> 00:22:27.981
I was going to challenge them on some of their policies

424
00:22:27.981 --> 00:22:30.757
which were putting communities at great risk,

425
00:22:30.757 --> 00:22:33.109
nuclear waste, particularly,

426
00:22:33.109 --> 00:22:37.813
and so I had this sense of pervading evil around the city.

427
00:22:39.083 --> 00:22:42.281
And this time, it's been the financial community

428
00:22:42.281 --> 00:22:44.345
who have been inviting me in.

429
00:22:44.345 --> 00:22:48.175
They don't believe fully in the global warming story.

430
00:22:48.175 --> 00:22:52.159
They can make a huge amount of money out of it, either way,

431
00:22:52.159 --> 00:22:55.201
they see it as, having read my work,

432
00:22:55.201 --> 00:22:59.761
they see it as a potential, they see it as an asset bubble,

433
00:22:59.761 --> 00:23:01.985
the whole carbon trade system.

434
00:23:01.985 --> 00:23:04.911
<v Regina>That's true, that's a good way to put it.</v>

435
00:23:04.911 --> 00:23:07.359
<v ->And if they can predict when it will break,</v>

436
00:23:07.359 --> 00:23:10.481
they can make money in the up-phase and the down-phase,

437
00:23:10.481 --> 00:23:13.457
so my message then is I'm not here

438
00:23:13.457 --> 00:23:16.433
to help you make money or avoid losing money.

439
00:23:16.433 --> 00:23:19.887
The only reason I've come here to talk with you

440
00:23:19.887 --> 00:23:24.641
is I want to know why you are engaged on enterprise,

441
00:23:24.641 --> 00:23:26.839
where, within your own definitions,

442
00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:30.823
the ethical and sustainable investment funds

443
00:23:30.823 --> 00:23:33.155
are a tiny percentage of what you do,

444
00:23:33.155 --> 00:23:36.617
which means everything else that you do is not ethical,

445
00:23:36.617 --> 00:23:38.863
and it's not sustainable, I want to know

446
00:23:38.863 --> 00:23:40.109
what you're going to do about it.

447
00:23:40.109 --> 00:23:41.501
<v Regina>And what did they say?</v>

448
00:23:41.501 --> 00:23:43.131
<v ->They said, "We're stuck.</v>

449
00:23:43.131 --> 00:23:47.357
"We are stuck, we can't change the system."

450
00:23:47.357 --> 00:23:50.399
But what really surprised me is that,

451
00:23:50.399 --> 00:23:54.257
my image of them before I met them was of casino gamblers,

452
00:23:54.257 --> 00:23:57.569
and some people we really need to replace,

453
00:23:57.569 --> 00:24:01.839
actually I was meeting a very different kind of person,

454
00:24:01.839 --> 00:24:05.585
people who obviously genuinely cared,

455
00:24:05.585 --> 00:24:08.129
they were not casino gamblers,

456
00:24:08.129 --> 00:24:12.305
and given the changes that their community has gone through

457
00:24:12.305 --> 00:24:14.359
in the last couple of years,

458
00:24:14.359 --> 00:24:18.533
both financially and also in terms of their standing,

459
00:24:18.533 --> 00:24:22.717
their reputation, with people of their own,

460
00:24:22.717 --> 00:24:27.469
their own people indulging the most incredible levels

461
00:24:27.469 --> 00:24:29.963
of corruption, the Ponzi scheme,

462
00:24:29.963 --> 00:24:31.499
where one man can take

463
00:24:31.499 --> 00:24:35.579
down $50 billion of other people's money,

464
00:24:35.579 --> 00:24:40.467
so I'm talking, but at the same time,

465
00:24:40.467 --> 00:24:43.067
I'm expanding my awareness and going, oh,

466
00:24:43.067 --> 00:24:47.339
this feels clear, where has the evil gone?

467
00:24:47.339 --> 00:24:50.525
And I thought, well, surely I'm not being fooled here,

468
00:24:50.525 --> 00:24:53.501
I don't think so, I'm actually quite sensitive on--

469
00:24:53.501 --> 00:24:57.167
not so much on an energetic, crystal level

470
00:24:57.167 --> 00:24:59.807
like a lot of new age people I'm aware,

471
00:24:59.807 --> 00:25:03.839
sensitive on an energetic personal level,

472
00:25:03.839 --> 00:25:06.641
where the power flows, in shamanic work,

473
00:25:06.641 --> 00:25:10.049
I can see the power lines, as it were.

474
00:25:10.049 --> 00:25:13.553
And so I thought, could it be

475
00:25:13.553 --> 00:25:18.333
that they have reformed, that they've woken up to something?

476
00:25:18.333 --> 00:25:21.987
And at that point, we ended up having a conversation,

477
00:25:21.987 --> 00:25:24.533
I was sort of just check them out,

478
00:25:24.533 --> 00:25:26.115
in terms of how much they knew

479
00:25:26.115 --> 00:25:28.227
about something called the Carrington Event,

480
00:25:28.227 --> 00:25:33.075
1859, huge magnetic pulse from the sun.

481
00:25:33.075 --> 00:25:37.509
It's fairly a regular occurrence, it's perfectly natural,

482
00:25:37.509 --> 00:25:39.717
one could expect another one anytime,

483
00:25:39.717 --> 00:25:42.021
particularly in the next couple of years.

484
00:25:42.021 --> 00:25:44.613
It would take down civilization.

485
00:25:44.613 --> 00:25:47.589
The electrical grids could be

486
00:25:47.589 --> 00:25:51.129
effectively destroyed and irreparably so.

487
00:25:51.129 --> 00:25:55.527
And there's been a recent US Academy of Sciences report

488
00:25:55.527 --> 00:25:59.175
on the consequences of that saying that we're not ready.

489
00:25:59.175 --> 00:26:01.045
<v Regina>Can you explain the Carrington Event?</v>

490
00:26:01.045 --> 00:26:03.207
<v ->The Carrington Event, there was a British astronomer</v>

491
00:26:03.207 --> 00:26:06.375
in 1859, happened to have his telescope on the sun,

492
00:26:06.375 --> 00:26:10.419
and it flashed,

493
00:26:10.419 --> 00:26:12.165
and he caught it,

494
00:26:12.165 --> 00:26:15.557
and described it and wrote it down,

495
00:26:15.557 --> 00:26:19.001
and about 17 hours later,

496
00:26:19.001 --> 00:26:23.513
the Aurora Borealis spread.

497
00:26:23.513 --> 00:26:26.267
And there's actually an aurora in the southern hemisphere.

498
00:26:26.267 --> 00:26:30.203
Those two auroras spread to encompass the whole globe.

499
00:26:30.203 --> 00:26:33.265
And people could read newspapers in Havana,

500
00:26:33.265 --> 00:26:36.193
in the tropics, in the middle of the night.

501
00:26:36.193 --> 00:26:38.543
But of course, this is just an incredible light show,

502
00:26:38.543 --> 00:26:41.141
and it's, "Oh, what is happening?"

503
00:26:41.141 --> 00:26:44.203
But to the budding sciences,

504
00:26:44.203 --> 00:26:48.523
of atmospheric physics, magnetics, astronomy, and so forth,

505
00:26:48.523 --> 00:26:51.835
they knew that a magnetic pulse

506
00:26:51.835 --> 00:26:54.907
had arrived shortly after the flare.

507
00:26:54.907 --> 00:26:58.411
Now, at that time, the only power lines

508
00:26:58.411 --> 00:27:01.531
were telegraph wires, which, don't carry

509
00:27:01.531 --> 00:27:04.219
a huge amount of power, they're very thin,

510
00:27:04.219 --> 00:27:06.475
but they go on some distance,

511
00:27:06.475 --> 00:27:10.795
and the magnetic wave, if the power lines are long enough,

512
00:27:10.795 --> 00:27:13.915
and thick enough, it will induce a current.

513
00:27:13.915 --> 00:27:17.131
Well, it induced the current in the telegraph wires,

514
00:27:17.131 --> 00:27:19.645
and the telegraph operators burned their fingers

515
00:27:19.645 --> 00:27:21.997
and the paper caught fire.

516
00:27:21.997 --> 00:27:25.369
But apart from that, no great shakes.

517
00:27:25.369 --> 00:27:30.253
The same wave today, going through 40,000 volt power lines

518
00:27:30.253 --> 00:27:33.345
and massive transformers, could melt down

519
00:27:33.345 --> 00:27:37.653
the system to such an effect that it wouldn't be reparable,

520
00:27:37.653 --> 00:27:40.979
and indeed, the National Academy of Sciences report

521
00:27:40.979 --> 00:27:44.041
says it takes three to four years to repair it,

522
00:27:44.041 --> 00:27:45.913
in which time--

523
00:27:45.913 --> 00:27:48.073
<v Regina>Essentially, the grid's down.</v>

524
00:27:48.073 --> 00:27:51.017
<v ->Yes, and people don't realize how much</v>

525
00:27:51.017 --> 00:27:52.821
they've come to rely on electricity

526
00:27:52.821 --> 00:27:55.355
and everything is pumped electrically,

527
00:27:55.355 --> 00:27:57.753
the fuel and the petro stations,

528
00:27:57.753 --> 00:28:00.969
the water in the taps, the whole transport system,

529
00:28:00.969 --> 00:28:03.465
or communication systems, radio, TV,

530
00:28:03.465 --> 00:28:06.825
you would be at the same level,

531
00:28:06.825 --> 00:28:09.435
in terms of emergency services,

532
00:28:09.435 --> 00:28:12.795
as a nuclear weapon that exploded,

533
00:28:12.795 --> 00:28:15.387
and you get what is called an electromagnetic pulse,

534
00:28:15.387 --> 00:28:18.379
and so emergency services, military vehicles,

535
00:28:18.379 --> 00:28:21.499
are all hardened against this magnetic wave,

536
00:28:21.499 --> 00:28:24.139
little Faraday cages to protect them.

537
00:28:24.139 --> 00:28:28.189
Well, the general civil system isn't protected,

538
00:28:28.189 --> 00:28:31.279
and it would go down, and this has been

539
00:28:31.279 --> 00:28:35.397
discussed in US Congress, not so much publicly here,

540
00:28:35.397 --> 00:28:37.893
and I think even the Congressional hearings

541
00:28:37.893 --> 00:28:41.541
were relatively quiet and not publicized,

542
00:28:41.541 --> 00:28:43.527
in order not to scare people.

543
00:28:43.527 --> 00:28:45.319
But essentially, they were saying

544
00:28:45.319 --> 00:28:48.439
we couldn't support 95% of the population,

545
00:28:48.439 --> 00:28:53.227
because everything is tuned now, distribution-wise,

546
00:28:53.227 --> 00:28:56.395
to about three or four days of supply of food.

547
00:28:56.395 --> 00:29:00.043
We need water, will be a problem within 24 hours.

548
00:29:00.043 --> 00:29:02.449
<v Regina>So now what was your purpose</v>

549
00:29:02.449 --> 00:29:04.369
in the board room for asking them

550
00:29:04.369 --> 00:29:06.145
if they had knowledge of the Carrington Event

551
00:29:06.145 --> 00:29:08.899
and then their response to you, tell us the relevance.

552
00:29:08.899 --> 00:29:12.057
<v ->In a way, I was kind of being provocative</v>

553
00:29:12.057 --> 00:29:15.561
by saying, "How many of you heard of this?"

554
00:29:15.561 --> 00:29:19.647
Because, you know, it's being discussed in the Americas,

555
00:29:19.647 --> 00:29:24.139
it's obviously of fantastically important significance,

556
00:29:24.139 --> 00:29:27.133
and I'm also saying, isn't it amazing

557
00:29:27.133 --> 00:29:31.471
that an advanced civilization, with all these

558
00:29:31.471 --> 00:29:34.207
intelligent scientists, should construct something

559
00:29:34.207 --> 00:29:36.835
that is so incredibly vulnerable

560
00:29:36.835 --> 00:29:40.481
to a perfectly natural and regular event?

561
00:29:40.481 --> 00:29:42.595
And this has been known for some time.

562
00:29:42.595 --> 00:29:44.275
<v Regina>So how many of them have heard of it?</v>

563
00:29:44.275 --> 00:29:47.059
<v ->Actually, although they received that fairly quietly,</v>

564
00:29:47.059 --> 00:29:49.765
a very distinguished gentleman came up to me

565
00:29:49.765 --> 00:29:52.597
after the presentation and said,

566
00:29:52.597 --> 00:29:54.709
"Well, I know about the Carrington Event,"

567
00:29:54.709 --> 00:29:58.347
and it was a kind of nudge-nudge-wink-wink kind of moment,

568
00:29:58.347 --> 00:30:00.997
where he said, "I'm a bit of an amateur astronomer."

569
00:30:02.417 --> 00:30:06.245
What that could mean, I really felt that it did mean,

570
00:30:06.245 --> 00:30:09.355
is that within our esoteric study circles,

571
00:30:09.355 --> 00:30:12.119
astronomy and astrology are not separated,

572
00:30:12.119 --> 00:30:15.037
as indeed, they weren't during Newton's time.

573
00:30:15.037 --> 00:30:18.109
And so they know about this.

574
00:30:18.109 --> 00:30:21.761
And when then I meditated on it enough,

575
00:30:21.761 --> 00:30:26.027
I thought, well, it's as if they've woken up

576
00:30:26.027 --> 00:30:28.775
to the fact that

577
00:30:30.311 --> 00:30:33.191
she, if you like the ultimate power

578
00:30:33.191 --> 00:30:36.119
in the universe, which I have this kind of way

579
00:30:36.119 --> 00:30:38.815
of looking at the masonic enterprise

580
00:30:38.815 --> 00:30:42.031
as a rebellion against

581
00:30:43.651 --> 00:30:48.347
the ultimate power or divinity of the universe,

582
00:30:48.347 --> 00:30:51.697
which in almost every culture is feminine.

583
00:30:51.697 --> 00:30:55.395
This Kalos in the Greek tradition,

584
00:30:55.395 --> 00:30:57.747
Kali in the yogic tradition.

585
00:30:59.027 --> 00:31:03.851
The thing what birthed everything was dark,

586
00:31:03.851 --> 00:31:06.461
had no form, was before everything,

587
00:31:06.461 --> 00:31:09.433
gave birth to everything, and is ultimate consciousness

588
00:31:09.433 --> 00:31:11.489
from which everything has come,

589
00:31:11.489 --> 00:31:16.021
and is love, and so this is all pervading,

590
00:31:16.021 --> 00:31:20.151
and there's also the sense that she,

591
00:31:20.151 --> 00:31:24.369
the originator of our evolution,

592
00:31:24.369 --> 00:31:27.249
is dreaming everything,

593
00:31:27.249 --> 00:31:29.505
including the birth of stars.

594
00:31:29.505 --> 00:31:32.769
Now, we're now capable of watching the birth of stars,

595
00:31:32.769 --> 00:31:37.041
and we live within the realm of one star,

596
00:31:37.041 --> 00:31:40.309
so it's like,

597
00:31:40.309 --> 00:31:43.285
where has human consciousness come from?

598
00:31:43.285 --> 00:31:46.333
Well, the original alchemists,

599
00:31:46.333 --> 00:31:49.083
astrologers,

600
00:31:49.083 --> 00:31:53.761
knew that, in a sense, there isn't a from,

601
00:31:53.761 --> 00:31:57.975
that it's all here, it's all in the microcosm,

602
00:31:57.975 --> 00:32:02.823
and that we are galactic, cosmic beings,

603
00:32:02.823 --> 00:32:06.373
and astrology defines us

604
00:32:06.373 --> 00:32:09.039
by galactic coordinates.

605
00:32:09.039 --> 00:32:13.763
And so, for me, it's perfectly logical, perfectly scientific

606
00:32:13.763 --> 00:32:17.431
to say that we exist in the beginning,

607
00:32:17.431 --> 00:32:19.771
just as it's perfectly plausible to say

608
00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:22.509
the oak tree exists in the acorn.

609
00:32:22.509 --> 00:32:26.479
And so we have the dream

610
00:32:26.479 --> 00:32:29.905
of the universe and of evolution,

611
00:32:29.905 --> 00:32:32.449
and of eventually the human being.

612
00:32:32.449 --> 00:32:36.337
And, you know, with my own children, I have

613
00:32:37.717 --> 00:32:40.681
the almost impossible task of putting

614
00:32:40.681 --> 00:32:43.369
to them the possibility, just the possibility,

615
00:32:43.369 --> 00:32:45.931
rational possibility, that actually we as humans

616
00:32:45.931 --> 00:32:48.187
are the bleeding edge,

617
00:32:48.187 --> 00:32:50.203
we're what the universe is all about,

618
00:32:50.203 --> 00:32:53.773
we're what evolution has been created for,

619
00:32:55.191 --> 00:32:59.207
in order that we can taste ourselves

620
00:32:59.207 --> 00:33:02.413
as long as this divine energy,

621
00:33:02.413 --> 00:33:04.861
and it's so simple, actually,

622
00:33:04.861 --> 00:33:07.645
it's not a complex mathematical system,

623
00:33:07.645 --> 00:33:09.401
it's actually the simplicity of the heart,

624
00:33:09.401 --> 00:33:11.023
the wisdom of the heart,

625
00:33:11.023 --> 00:33:13.375
and this is incredibly deep stuff.

626
00:33:13.375 --> 00:33:16.271
They're going, "No, no, no, Dad," you know,

627
00:33:16.271 --> 00:33:18.885
No, no, no, there are hundreds of planets out there,

628
00:33:18.885 --> 00:33:20.661
hundred of Earths that,

629
00:33:20.661 --> 00:33:23.769
you know, far more advanced civilizations,

630
00:33:23.769 --> 00:33:25.879
and they've all been brought up

631
00:33:25.879 --> 00:33:28.809
on the projection of aliens coming here and so forth,

632
00:33:28.809 --> 00:33:30.745
and there's no here or there.

633
00:33:32.225 --> 00:33:35.515
<v Regina>Now is, okay, now let's take that,</v>

634
00:33:35.515 --> 00:33:38.011
and let's take this understanding,

635
00:33:38.011 --> 00:33:40.445
you were talking about, again, back to the board room,

636
00:33:40.445 --> 00:33:41.979
where it appears some of these beings

637
00:33:41.979 --> 00:33:44.381
have been somewhat humbled by recent events

638
00:33:44.381 --> 00:33:47.693
and perhaps by what could manifest

639
00:33:47.693 --> 00:33:51.101
in the near future, which these cosmological events

640
00:33:51.101 --> 00:33:54.219
regarding the sun, that, yes I have read about this,

641
00:33:54.219 --> 00:33:57.293
and heard about this as well, and what this means,

642
00:33:57.293 --> 00:34:00.595
where this is taking them, who are the policy makers

643
00:34:00.595 --> 00:34:02.755
and the money controllers of this planet.

644
00:34:02.755 --> 00:34:05.251
<v ->That's right, well, some time ago,</v>

645
00:34:05.251 --> 00:34:08.707
when I had a bigger clash with them,

646
00:34:08.707 --> 00:34:11.587
the only way I kind of survived that clash,

647
00:34:11.587 --> 00:34:14.227
they're far more adept than I--

648
00:34:14.227 --> 00:34:15.953
<v Regina>What do you mean by that?</v>

649
00:34:17.163 --> 00:34:19.177
<v ->In the sense that--</v>

650
00:34:20.917 --> 00:34:25.049
one learns in yogic training that there are powers, cities,

651
00:34:25.049 --> 00:34:27.641
so it would be perfectly possible

652
00:34:27.641 --> 00:34:30.089
to read somebody's mind,

653
00:34:30.089 --> 00:34:32.249
to put thoughts into somebody's mind,

654
00:34:32.249 --> 00:34:35.215
to travel astrally, what in the west might

655
00:34:35.215 --> 00:34:38.843
be called remote viewing, it's well known in India,

656
00:34:38.843 --> 00:34:40.577
like I said, it's a normal cities--

657
00:34:40.577 --> 00:34:42.017
<v Regina>So you're saying, essentially,</v>

658
00:34:42.017 --> 00:34:44.215
that the powers that are in control of these systems

659
00:34:44.215 --> 00:34:45.875
have their own adepts working on their behalfs.

660
00:34:45.875 --> 00:34:48.419
<v ->There are, outside of personal experience, so,</v>

661
00:34:48.419 --> 00:34:51.443
and them I'm completely out of my depth,

662
00:34:51.443 --> 00:34:54.553
and I only emerge from this clash with these,

663
00:34:54.553 --> 00:34:56.473
with this organization,

664
00:34:56.473 --> 00:34:59.977
by the skin of my teeth and the help of my guru,

665
00:34:59.977 --> 00:35:02.453
and so I'm going, well, what was all that about?

666
00:35:02.453 --> 00:35:04.179
They could take me out tomorrow.

667
00:35:04.179 --> 00:35:06.101
<v Regina>And they've taken many out.</v>

668
00:35:06.101 --> 00:35:08.597
<v ->And indeed, people were murdered,</v>

669
00:35:08.597 --> 00:35:11.273
and I've had recent cause to be involved

670
00:35:11.273 --> 00:35:14.507
in the David Kelly affair, writing to the judge

671
00:35:14.507 --> 00:35:17.051
who had the inquiry, saying, "Look,

672
00:35:17.051 --> 00:35:19.355
"I know people, 20 years ago,

673
00:35:19.355 --> 00:35:22.907
"who were in similar circumstances, crossed the government.

674
00:35:22.907 --> 00:35:25.661
"This is a ritual killing in order to make

675
00:35:25.661 --> 00:35:27.665
"sure nobody else spills the beans."

676
00:35:27.665 --> 00:35:29.681
<v Regina>And that inquiry's being opened again, right?</v>

677
00:35:29.681 --> 00:35:32.177
<v ->That's being reopened, where the medical profession,</v>

678
00:35:32.177 --> 00:35:34.625
in arising at the time, is saying

679
00:35:34.625 --> 00:35:37.409
it's unheard of that there's not an inquest,

680
00:35:37.409 --> 00:35:39.473
it's unheard of that the medical records

681
00:35:39.473 --> 00:35:41.297
have not been made public.

682
00:35:41.297 --> 00:35:42.821
<v Regina>So we'll be watching for that.</v>

683
00:35:42.821 --> 00:35:43.829
<v ->Yes.</v>

684
00:35:45.489 --> 00:35:49.671
So I re-emerged safe,

685
00:35:49.671 --> 00:35:53.135
from the previous encounters,

686
00:35:53.135 --> 00:35:55.669
through meditation, which essentially

687
00:35:55.669 --> 00:35:59.893
was, "There is no they, we are one being."

688
00:35:59.893 --> 00:36:03.397
And when one enters into that heart space,

689
00:36:03.397 --> 00:36:05.989
then there are no enemies.

690
00:36:05.989 --> 00:36:09.157
And so we're returning to that eternal wisdom,

691
00:36:09.157 --> 00:36:12.133
and in fact, Jesus lived,

692
00:36:12.133 --> 00:36:14.437
which is that there is no enemy,

693
00:36:14.437 --> 00:36:18.277
and if you fall into that illusion of enemy,

694
00:36:18.277 --> 00:36:20.485
then you are losing something

695
00:36:20.485 --> 00:36:24.037
of a fundamental nature of human beings.

696
00:36:24.037 --> 00:36:26.533
<v Regina>So you recovered yourself through consciousness,</v>

697
00:36:26.533 --> 00:36:31.189
that essentially removed any kind

698
00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:34.501
of resistance within the being?

699
00:36:34.501 --> 00:36:38.485
<v ->Yeah, and so there was no question of fighting anymore.</v>

700
00:36:38.485 --> 00:36:43.015
And if we think we have to fight,

701
00:36:43.015 --> 00:36:46.471
that something else is more powerful than us,

702
00:36:46.471 --> 00:36:50.119
is threatening us, is threatening our survival,

703
00:36:50.119 --> 00:36:54.247
then we are already giving away the essence,

704
00:36:54.247 --> 00:36:57.987
the highest essence of what it is to be a true human being.

705
00:36:57.987 --> 00:37:00.473
<v Regina>And I want to make this clear at this point,</v>

706
00:37:00.473 --> 00:37:03.065
in case it's thinly disguised or not,

707
00:37:03.065 --> 00:37:08.053
we're talking about using, essentially,

708
00:37:08.053 --> 00:37:12.075
psychic weaponry against enemies of the state,

709
00:37:12.075 --> 00:37:14.763
which occurs in the US and occurs in a lot of places.

710
00:37:14.763 --> 00:37:18.331
And the only consciousness, consciousness is really

711
00:37:18.331 --> 00:37:22.401
the only way you can find your way out of that maze.

712
00:37:22.401 --> 00:37:23.745
<v ->That's right.</v>

713
00:37:23.745 --> 00:37:25.931
<v Regina>And that this is not known well.</v>

714
00:37:25.931 --> 00:37:28.763
<v ->And the people who are engaging in this</v>

715
00:37:28.763 --> 00:37:32.171
kind of psychic warfare are lost.

716
00:37:32.171 --> 00:37:33.755
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

717
00:37:33.755 --> 00:37:36.875
<v ->And in fact, the one person that said this</v>

718
00:37:36.875 --> 00:37:39.887
in a rather obscure way,

719
00:37:39.887 --> 00:37:44.113
was the person we least expected, which was Ronald Reagan,

720
00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:50.707
visiting a Nazi cemetery at some point,

721
00:37:50.707 --> 00:37:53.075
and getting away from his minders,

722
00:37:53.075 --> 00:37:54.995
and saying, "Well, of course,

723
00:37:54.995 --> 00:37:57.877
"the Nazis were as much a victim of Hitler's

724
00:37:57.877 --> 00:38:00.805
"as anybody, as the Jews."

725
00:38:00.805 --> 00:38:02.407
And that's a profound--

726
00:38:02.407 --> 00:38:04.951
<v Regina>Yes, I have heard that,</v>

727
00:38:04.951 --> 00:38:06.775
and it is a profound statement,

728
00:38:06.775 --> 00:38:08.405
which would appear to be true

729
00:38:08.405 --> 00:38:10.903
if you can back up and look at it from a different angle.

730
00:38:10.903 --> 00:38:13.351
<v ->Yeah, they were lost, in a very dark place.</v>

731
00:38:13.351 --> 00:38:15.241
<v Regina>A place of fear.</v>

732
00:38:15.241 --> 00:38:17.401
<v ->And perhaps not widely known,</v>

733
00:38:17.401 --> 00:38:20.713
but Hitler was an adept, he was a devotee

734
00:38:20.713 --> 00:38:24.361
of Satan in that sense,

735
00:38:24.361 --> 00:38:27.769
and we think, oh, satanic ritual, satanic rites,

736
00:38:27.769 --> 00:38:31.219
but in the deeper esoteric,

737
00:38:31.219 --> 00:38:32.707
it's particularly understood

738
00:38:32.707 --> 00:38:34.771
much more clearly in the Middle East,

739
00:38:34.771 --> 00:38:37.255
Satan is the tester,

740
00:38:37.255 --> 00:38:39.607
and so it has to exist,

741
00:38:39.607 --> 00:38:43.877
and that incredible essence of the human,

742
00:38:43.877 --> 00:38:46.653
of what is evolving in humanity,

743
00:38:46.653 --> 00:38:49.437
and again, come back to Jesus,

744
00:38:49.437 --> 00:38:52.427
"Get thee behind me, Satan,"

745
00:38:52.427 --> 00:38:56.787
it's like, the tester has to be there,

746
00:38:56.787 --> 00:39:01.443
and love can only grow strong when it is tested.

747
00:39:01.443 --> 00:39:03.939
And so something is being

748
00:39:03.939 --> 00:39:06.579
refined through evolutionary history,

749
00:39:06.579 --> 00:39:08.787
and for me, it's the human heart,

750
00:39:08.787 --> 00:39:12.339
and this was something that the Egyptians understood.

751
00:39:12.339 --> 00:39:14.499
<v Regina>They understood well, in Maat,</v>

752
00:39:14.499 --> 00:39:17.829
harmony, and weighing the weight of the heart,

753
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:19.653
and the experience of the being,

754
00:39:19.653 --> 00:39:21.889
against the feather and lightness of being.

755
00:39:21.889 --> 00:39:23.415
<v ->And the importance of death.</v>

756
00:39:23.415 --> 00:39:26.151
So that is the point at which

757
00:39:26.151 --> 00:39:29.895
everything that you have refined is harvested,

758
00:39:29.895 --> 00:39:34.023
and you give away this body, this personality,

759
00:39:34.023 --> 00:39:37.491
this cloak, this coat, and so it's the ultimate service

760
00:39:37.491 --> 00:39:42.465
to the divine, and this is consciousness that's been,

761
00:39:42.465 --> 00:39:44.331
not just lost,

762
00:39:44.331 --> 00:39:48.793
but deliberately expunged,

763
00:39:48.793 --> 00:39:52.833
and in, for example,

764
00:39:52.833 --> 00:39:55.155
the whole of the environmental movement

765
00:39:55.155 --> 00:39:57.987
and the whole climate change debate and so forth,

766
00:39:57.987 --> 00:39:59.481
my colleagues,

767
00:39:59.481 --> 00:40:03.417
people who I fought side by side with

768
00:40:03.417 --> 00:40:06.237
20 years ago, for the oceans, for the atmosphere,

769
00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:09.117
for clean rivers, for forests, and all of that,

770
00:40:09.117 --> 00:40:12.259
at that time, many of them

771
00:40:12.259 --> 00:40:15.427
with quite strong spiritual connection, especially

772
00:40:15.427 --> 00:40:17.587
to Native American spiritual teachings,

773
00:40:17.587 --> 00:40:22.067
they have lost the plot, they now talk survivalism,

774
00:40:22.067 --> 00:40:26.339
they talk materialism, they use fear tactics,

775
00:40:26.339 --> 00:40:31.139
scare stories, and so within a very short time,

776
00:40:31.139 --> 00:40:33.251
where before

777
00:40:33.251 --> 00:40:37.859
the enemy always included

778
00:40:37.859 --> 00:40:40.547
the organizations like the UN,

779
00:40:40.547 --> 00:40:44.627
and the European Union, and the scientific institutions,

780
00:40:44.627 --> 00:40:46.691
and the prime ministers,

781
00:40:46.691 --> 00:40:48.579
and the chief government scientific advisors,

782
00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:50.739
they were all in cahoots.

783
00:40:50.739 --> 00:40:53.609
It's very strange, now you will find

784
00:40:53.609 --> 00:40:57.113
Greenpeace aligned with these people,

785
00:40:57.113 --> 00:40:59.683
quoting Tony Blair,

786
00:40:59.683 --> 00:41:01.715
the chief government scientific advisor,

787
00:41:01.715 --> 00:41:04.835
the UN committee, and I'm going,

788
00:41:04.835 --> 00:41:08.521
since when did they ever lead on anything,

789
00:41:08.521 --> 00:41:11.705
you know, acid rain, genetic, these same people

790
00:41:11.705 --> 00:41:15.689
they are now quoting as allies in global warming

791
00:41:15.689 --> 00:41:19.145
are also preparing the solution for global warming,

792
00:41:19.145 --> 00:41:22.867
nuclear power, genetically modified organisms,

793
00:41:22.867 --> 00:41:24.739
agri-business,

794
00:41:24.739 --> 00:41:29.011
global universal education, in what, science,

795
00:41:29.011 --> 00:41:31.737
and it's then I'm coming to the point where,

796
00:41:31.737 --> 00:41:34.329
because I have a deep concern

797
00:41:34.329 --> 00:41:38.169
for international development issues, as an ecologist,

798
00:41:38.169 --> 00:41:40.953
and I see the remedies that are being,

799
00:41:40.953 --> 00:41:43.545
and I'm thinking, this isn't going to help.

800
00:41:43.545 --> 00:41:45.657
You know, to develop these people,

801
00:41:45.657 --> 00:41:48.585
like developing Africa, take the people off the land

802
00:41:48.585 --> 00:41:50.323
and put them in the cities and get them jobs

803
00:41:50.323 --> 00:41:52.643
and education and so forth, and it's like,

804
00:41:52.643 --> 00:41:55.753
come on, there's no room for that anymore,

805
00:41:55.753 --> 00:41:58.745
and it's not going to work, and the soil won't do it,

806
00:41:58.745 --> 00:42:02.249
what these people need is resilient community,

807
00:42:02.249 --> 00:42:05.337
they need to be able to hold their own culture together.

808
00:42:05.337 --> 00:42:09.513
And the development process destroys that.

809
00:42:09.513 --> 00:42:12.947
<v Regina>And there's something else in that,</v>

810
00:42:12.947 --> 00:42:15.875
the sustainability business now

811
00:42:15.875 --> 00:42:17.971
destroys that also, and I would like for you

812
00:42:17.971 --> 00:42:20.579
to talk about that, hand in hand with what you're saying.

813
00:42:20.579 --> 00:42:23.555
<v ->Well, if we look at, say, sustainable energy,</v>

814
00:42:23.555 --> 00:42:27.683
which is the big one, it's a combination of peak oil,

815
00:42:27.683 --> 00:42:31.667
the peak oil scare story, and the global warming scare story

816
00:42:31.667 --> 00:42:34.723
and the green movement intends,

817
00:42:34.723 --> 00:42:36.739
and it's all in motion,

818
00:42:36.739 --> 00:42:39.907
to transfer vast amounts of money,

819
00:42:39.907 --> 00:42:44.195
largely from the consumer, billion, actually trillions,

820
00:42:44.195 --> 00:42:47.475
into the banks

821
00:42:47.475 --> 00:42:50.355
who already control development,

822
00:42:50.355 --> 00:42:52.371
there's nothing gets developed on the planet

823
00:42:52.371 --> 00:42:55.251
that some bank manager doesn't decide.

824
00:42:55.251 --> 00:42:58.323
And so this is trillions will be given

825
00:42:58.323 --> 00:43:01.443
to some IMF construction within the UN,

826
00:43:01.443 --> 00:43:06.051
with no oversight, no elected representatives to control,

827
00:43:06.051 --> 00:43:10.755
to develop a strategy for supposed sustainability.

828
00:43:10.755 --> 00:43:12.867
What that sustainability means

829
00:43:12.867 --> 00:43:16.995
is dams in remote, beautiful mountain,

830
00:43:16.995 --> 00:43:19.203
forested mountain regions,

831
00:43:19.203 --> 00:43:21.123
where there are indigenous people.

832
00:43:21.123 --> 00:43:22.819
There are at least 50 dams being planned

833
00:43:22.819 --> 00:43:24.883
in the upper reaches of the Amazon.

834
00:43:24.883 --> 00:43:27.811
The remote, biodiverse highlands

835
00:43:27.811 --> 00:43:30.259
of Vietnam and southeast Asia,

836
00:43:30.259 --> 00:43:32.851
Tibet, the Himalayas and so forth.

837
00:43:32.851 --> 00:43:35.539
bow arches on the s-trees,

838
00:43:35.539 --> 00:43:40.405
massive, giant aerospace propellers on stilts, I call them.

839
00:43:40.405 --> 00:43:42.963
They call them windmills, but they're actually

840
00:43:42.963 --> 00:43:46.163
humongous turbines

841
00:43:46.163 --> 00:43:49.235
which massacre eagles and vultures

842
00:43:49.235 --> 00:43:52.307
and destroy the continuity of the landscape.

843
00:43:53.487 --> 00:43:57.891
Nuclear power is undergoing a renaissance,

844
00:43:57.891 --> 00:44:01.155
because it's low carbon and so forth.

845
00:44:01.155 --> 00:44:04.291
Biofuels, the very forests that the groups

846
00:44:04.291 --> 00:44:06.931
wanted to preserve now being cut down

847
00:44:06.931 --> 00:44:11.203
to provide ethanol for our biodiesel.

848
00:44:11.203 --> 00:44:13.267
<v Regina>And it just seems so crazy,</v>

849
00:44:13.267 --> 00:44:15.331
all in the name of sustainability, and,

850
00:44:15.331 --> 00:44:17.491
which, really if you reduce that down,

851
00:44:17.491 --> 00:44:19.363
comes down to baser fears of survival.

852
00:44:19.363 --> 00:44:21.571
<v ->It's sustainability, and I asked them,</v>

853
00:44:21.571 --> 00:44:23.203
"What are you sustaining?

854
00:44:23.203 --> 00:44:27.555
"Where is the soul in all of this, where is the beauty?"

855
00:44:27.555 --> 00:44:29.875
And it's like they don't understand

856
00:44:29.875 --> 00:44:31.891
what language I'm talking.

857
00:44:31.891 --> 00:44:34.713
And rather than engage in discourse,

858
00:44:34.713 --> 00:44:38.601
they weren't, I've had no requests,

859
00:44:38.601 --> 00:44:40.953
having spent three years researching

860
00:44:40.953 --> 00:44:45.091
the global warming science, and I'm highly qualified.

861
00:44:45.091 --> 00:44:47.779
Yeah, I'm highly qualified to do that,

862
00:44:47.779 --> 00:44:50.995
I'm a science analyst, I don't practice science,

863
00:44:50.995 --> 00:44:53.059
I look at what the scientists are doing,

864
00:44:53.059 --> 00:44:55.929
and I've actually also constructed computer models

865
00:44:55.929 --> 00:44:57.961
and criticized global computer models,

866
00:44:57.961 --> 00:45:01.849
so I accepted the whole global warming story, actually,

867
00:45:01.849 --> 00:45:05.395
and have been involved in renewable energy strategies

868
00:45:05.395 --> 00:45:08.467
at very high levels, EU, our own government,

869
00:45:08.467 --> 00:45:10.089
been a government advisor,

870
00:45:10.089 --> 00:45:13.929
and I thought, this remedy is likely

871
00:45:13.929 --> 00:45:17.337
to be worse than the ailment that we're trying to treat.

872
00:45:17.337 --> 00:45:19.353
I want to know how much time we've got,

873
00:45:19.353 --> 00:45:22.425
whether we can really integrate these changes.

874
00:45:22.425 --> 00:45:24.201
I'll look at the science.

875
00:45:24.201 --> 00:45:26.505
I was absolutely shocked by what I found,

876
00:45:26.505 --> 00:45:28.329
because we're now discovering

877
00:45:28.329 --> 00:45:32.553
the UN commission is actually incompetent,

878
00:45:32.553 --> 00:45:36.755
and it was obvious within the first few months

879
00:45:36.755 --> 00:45:38.761
of looking at the science,

880
00:45:38.761 --> 00:45:40.969
comparing what they said to the original

881
00:45:40.969 --> 00:45:44.089
scientific literature, paired with literature,

882
00:45:44.089 --> 00:45:46.089
there was never any consensus,

883
00:45:46.089 --> 00:45:50.323
there are huge areas where they have fabricated a consensus.

884
00:45:50.323 --> 00:45:53.955
And so I write about this, and then that's

885
00:45:53.955 --> 00:45:56.083
half of the book, is analysis of the science,

886
00:45:56.083 --> 00:45:58.531
the other half is saying, what's going on?

887
00:45:58.531 --> 00:46:01.209
Why are you colluding with this?

888
00:46:01.209 --> 00:46:04.665
And then you see that the campaign in groups,

889
00:46:04.665 --> 00:46:07.401
where before, 20 years ago,

890
00:46:07.401 --> 00:46:11.337
we were in sleeping bags in little offices on the docks

891
00:46:11.337 --> 00:46:13.747
in the east end of London, Greenpeace.

892
00:46:13.747 --> 00:46:17.587
Now they have an office, pension funds,

893
00:46:17.587 --> 00:46:19.699
influence, lobbyists,

894
00:46:19.699 --> 00:46:23.721
and they've become a campaigning organization.

895
00:46:23.721 --> 00:46:26.553
And so they readily take up this story

896
00:46:26.553 --> 00:46:30.697
and don't analyze adequately, with a critical mind,

897
00:46:30.697 --> 00:46:33.193
whether it's true or not.

898
00:46:33.193 --> 00:46:35.417
And furthermore, they come up with a remedy

899
00:46:35.417 --> 00:46:38.889
and they don't analyze the consequences of their own remedy,

900
00:46:38.889 --> 00:46:41.001
such as the biofuels fiasco.

901
00:46:41.001 --> 00:46:44.531
So they are not

902
00:46:44.531 --> 00:46:47.875
welcoming my book and saying,

903
00:46:47.875 --> 00:46:52.137
"Here's someone we can trust from his lineage.

904
00:46:52.137 --> 00:46:54.531
"Come talk to us and explain."

905
00:46:54.531 --> 00:46:56.499
No, they're saying, "Don't talk to this guy.

906
00:46:56.499 --> 00:46:58.803
"Don't invite him in."

907
00:46:58.803 --> 00:47:01.779
I haven't had a single request from any environment group,

908
00:47:01.779 --> 00:47:05.379
and I've got serious environmental credentials,

909
00:47:05.379 --> 00:47:09.091
and track record, and so it's what's going on.

910
00:47:09.091 --> 00:47:11.443
The people who are inviting me to speak

911
00:47:11.443 --> 00:47:13.411
are the truth movement.

912
00:47:13.411 --> 00:47:15.907
I mean, people such as yourself

913
00:47:15.907 --> 00:47:19.507
who are not only interested in kind of political truths

914
00:47:19.507 --> 00:47:22.243
or what's happening behind the scenes,

915
00:47:22.243 --> 00:47:26.243
but spiritual truths, what's it really about.

916
00:47:26.243 --> 00:47:28.787
These questions are not being asked

917
00:47:28.787 --> 00:47:31.427
by the environmental group.

918
00:47:31.427 --> 00:47:33.539
<v Regina>Yes, interesting, isn't it?</v>

919
00:47:33.539 --> 00:47:36.515
<v ->And then you have the very strange situation</v>

920
00:47:36.515 --> 00:47:39.731
where I'm a naturally more kind of left-liberal person

921
00:47:39.731 --> 00:47:42.419
than I am a kind of right-wing,

922
00:47:42.419 --> 00:47:45.971
I would read certain newspapers and lean certain ways,

923
00:47:45.971 --> 00:47:49.859
and I'm finding that I can be on the front page

924
00:47:49.859 --> 00:47:53.843
of the most right-wing newspaper in Britain,

925
00:47:53.843 --> 00:47:58.163
it was like, last Monday, and I'm going, oh dear.

926
00:47:58.163 --> 00:48:01.603
The left-liberal press, I don't exist.

927
00:48:01.603 --> 00:48:03.043
They won't review my books,

928
00:48:03.043 --> 00:48:05.251
they reviewed my books on biodiversity,

929
00:48:05.251 --> 00:48:07.427
they won't review my book on climate change,

930
00:48:07.427 --> 00:48:08.963
they won't talk to me.

931
00:48:08.963 --> 00:48:12.323
<v Regina>Because you're taking a controversial viewpoint.</v>

932
00:48:12.323 --> 00:48:14.355
<v ->Actually there are correspondents recently</v>

933
00:48:14.355 --> 00:48:16.467
within, for example, the BBC,

934
00:48:16.467 --> 00:48:18.915
who have been texting me,

935
00:48:18.915 --> 00:48:20.803
"Read your book, thank you,"

936
00:48:20.803 --> 00:48:23.497
you know, and they're sharpening up their questions.

937
00:48:23.497 --> 00:48:26.019
So there is a change.

938
00:48:26.019 --> 00:48:28.131
<v Regina>Well, one of the comments on your book</v>

939
00:48:28.131 --> 00:48:31.011
is from the person that did the original draft

940
00:48:31.011 --> 00:48:34.131
of the Kyoto Treaty, they're basically saying,

941
00:48:34.131 --> 00:48:37.011
"Read this book, this man is telling the truth."

942
00:48:37.011 --> 00:48:39.667
<v ->I didn't know that my former colleague</v>

943
00:48:39.667 --> 00:48:42.019
had written the Kyoto Treaty,

944
00:48:42.019 --> 00:48:43.955
where, after we sorted the oceans out,

945
00:48:43.955 --> 00:48:47.363
he went on to work on climate atmosphere issues,

946
00:48:47.363 --> 00:48:49.619
and I went to work on forestry and wildlife,

947
00:48:49.619 --> 00:48:51.251
which is much closer to my heart,

948
00:48:51.251 --> 00:48:53.763
and carry on my druidic and shamanic practices.

949
00:48:53.763 --> 00:48:57.795
And so I contact him, via the publisher,

950
00:48:57.795 --> 00:49:00.451
and said, "Oh yeah, he's a professor emeritus

951
00:49:00.451 --> 00:49:03.187
"in, you know, the University of California.

952
00:49:03.187 --> 00:49:06.179
"He'll say something which, you know, will at least

953
00:49:06.179 --> 00:49:08.483
"tell people I do have credentials."

954
00:49:08.483 --> 00:49:10.213
And the publishers told me,

955
00:49:10.213 --> 00:49:12.453
"He says he wrote the Kyoto Protocol."

956
00:49:12.453 --> 00:49:15.285
I said, "No, that can't be right," but it was.

957
00:49:15.285 --> 00:49:17.637
And you'd think that counts for something.

958
00:49:17.637 --> 00:49:20.021
<v Regina>You'd think it would.</v>

959
00:49:20.021 --> 00:49:21.941
<v ->The most bizarre thing is,</v>

960
00:49:21.941 --> 00:49:25.493
they Google him, in this age of instant knowledge,

961
00:49:25.493 --> 00:49:27.845
and he doesn't have much of a profile

962
00:49:27.845 --> 00:49:30.581
on all the oceanic work that he did,

963
00:49:30.581 --> 00:49:33.653
and he's done incredible things for the planet.

964
00:49:34.893 --> 00:49:39.093
In his retirement, he's developed a miracle fitness workout,

965
00:49:39.093 --> 00:49:40.789
and so they're laughing at me and saying,

966
00:49:40.789 --> 00:49:43.429
"Well, Jackson Davis is a fitness instructor."

967
00:49:44.709 --> 00:49:47.573
As if I'm going to, or anybody is going to print

968
00:49:47.573 --> 00:49:51.605
that he wrote the Kyoto Protocol, and it's not true.

969
00:49:51.605 --> 00:49:54.235
So you are dealing with people

970
00:49:54.235 --> 00:49:56.197
who simply engage

971
00:49:56.197 --> 00:49:59.941
in propaganda and trickster stuff

972
00:49:59.941 --> 00:50:02.907
in order to maintain their position,

973
00:50:02.907 --> 00:50:06.267
and I honestly don't think the rank and file

974
00:50:06.267 --> 00:50:08.773
of the environmental movement have woken up

975
00:50:08.773 --> 00:50:10.821
to the level to which they're being tricked.

976
00:50:10.821 --> 00:50:12.405
It's like Al Gore.

977
00:50:12.405 --> 00:50:17.173
He can win a Nobel Prize, but he doesn't declare

978
00:50:17.173 --> 00:50:19.717
that he's also founded a carbon bank,

979
00:50:19.717 --> 00:50:22.357
and that if global warming is accepted

980
00:50:22.357 --> 00:50:24.229
by the US administration,

981
00:50:24.229 --> 00:50:28.405
he skyrockets from being a relatively obscure millionaire

982
00:50:28.405 --> 00:50:32.981
to billionaire status, and at the high table.

983
00:50:32.981 --> 00:50:35.237
Who else does he hang out with?

984
00:50:35.237 --> 00:50:38.587
You know, and look at, look at the energy

985
00:50:38.587 --> 00:50:40.987
that he's putting out.

986
00:50:40.987 --> 00:50:43.269
You know, I don't want to say negative things,

987
00:50:43.269 --> 00:50:46.149
because he's a hero to the environmental movement,

988
00:50:46.149 --> 00:50:47.699
but he gives me the creeps,

989
00:50:47.699 --> 00:50:50.439
if it's possible to say that without getting sued.

990
00:50:50.439 --> 00:50:51.939
<v Regina>No, you won't be sued.</v>

991
00:50:51.939 --> 00:50:54.189
So, now, going back to the high table, again,

992
00:50:54.189 --> 00:50:56.139
and so, not to be a bore,

993
00:50:56.139 --> 00:50:57.939
but I'll keep going back to this

994
00:50:57.939 --> 00:50:59.789
as you keep progressing the story

995
00:50:59.789 --> 00:51:02.589
in many different areas.

996
00:51:02.589 --> 00:51:06.039
Now, did you leave your meeting,

997
00:51:06.039 --> 00:51:07.642
a week or so ago, whenever that was,

998
00:51:07.642 --> 00:51:09.545
at the high table with these people,

999
00:51:09.545 --> 00:51:10.945
we talked about in the board room,

1000
00:51:10.945 --> 00:51:13.095
did you leave there with any sense of,

1001
00:51:13.095 --> 00:51:15.995
a different sense of what our direction may be,

1002
00:51:15.995 --> 00:51:17.995
or a sense of hope or connection or,

1003
00:51:17.995 --> 00:51:21.195
to extend this out to a potential larger policy

1004
00:51:21.195 --> 00:51:24.345
that could come about down the road,

1005
00:51:24.345 --> 00:51:25.995
what did this mean to you to have

1006
00:51:25.995 --> 00:51:27.795
that experience there that day?

1007
00:51:27.795 --> 00:51:30.701
<v ->It's very challenging for me.</v>

1008
00:51:30.701 --> 00:51:33.951
It's very challenging for me, because I have

1009
00:51:33.951 --> 00:51:37.351
been steeped in, "They are the enemy."

1010
00:51:38.551 --> 00:51:41.354
I've been steeped in battle,

1011
00:51:41.354 --> 00:51:44.604
I'm an old fighter of some kind.

1012
00:51:44.604 --> 00:51:49.551
And the challenge is to come up with the creative solution,

1013
00:51:49.551 --> 00:51:54.551
and these people are saying, "We don't have it."

1014
00:51:55.723 --> 00:51:58.519
They are stuck, the system doesn't give them

1015
00:51:58.519 --> 00:52:01.525
any room to move,

1016
00:52:01.525 --> 00:52:04.275
and so it's like,

1017
00:52:04.275 --> 00:52:06.525
okay, what is the solution?

1018
00:52:06.525 --> 00:52:09.125
And this is the challenge, and so

1019
00:52:09.125 --> 00:52:11.375
they're actually saying to me,

1020
00:52:12.515 --> 00:52:14.131
"What do you need?

1021
00:52:14.131 --> 00:52:17.543
"What help do you need, how can we help you?"

1022
00:52:17.543 --> 00:52:21.143
And I'm going, "I don't know, I'll come back to you."

1023
00:52:21.143 --> 00:52:24.293
And I'm still in that position,

1024
00:52:24.293 --> 00:52:26.708
and those meetings were several months ago,

1025
00:52:26.708 --> 00:52:31.005
towards the end of last year, early parts of this year.

1026
00:52:31.005 --> 00:52:35.158
And, there are people,

1027
00:52:35.158 --> 00:52:38.208
philanthropists and the financial community,

1028
00:52:38.208 --> 00:52:40.358
who are saying, "We want to do something."

1029
00:52:40.358 --> 00:52:43.058
And I am in the process of thinking,

1030
00:52:43.058 --> 00:52:44.755
"Well, what can be done?

1031
00:52:44.755 --> 00:52:46.961
"And how?"

1032
00:52:46.961 --> 00:52:51.370
And the answer that I'm coming up with is that

1033
00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:55.720
it's not entirely practical,

1034
00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:57.723
eco-sustainable communities,

1035
00:52:57.723 --> 00:53:00.773
we have to shift consciousness,

1036
00:53:00.773 --> 00:53:03.323
we have to raise consciousness.

1037
00:53:03.323 --> 00:53:05.926
Now, it's taken me

1038
00:53:05.926 --> 00:53:09.626
30 years of intense practice

1039
00:53:09.626 --> 00:53:12.176
and devoting a lot of time

1040
00:53:12.176 --> 00:53:16.476
at quite considerable consequence,

1041
00:53:16.476 --> 00:53:19.226
both to my personal life, my family life,

1042
00:53:19.226 --> 00:53:21.432
my scientific life,

1043
00:53:21.432 --> 00:53:24.032
it's not an easy thing.

1044
00:53:24.032 --> 00:53:28.338
I've, to raise my consciousness has been difficult,

1045
00:53:28.338 --> 00:53:31.438
and so when people say,

1046
00:53:31.438 --> 00:53:33.438
"Well, we have to shift consciousness,"

1047
00:53:33.438 --> 00:53:36.735
I go, "Yeah, we do, but it's not something

1048
00:53:36.735 --> 00:53:39.488
"that will be done to us," there's this expectation

1049
00:53:39.488 --> 00:53:42.035
in the new age that there will be some kind of cosmic wave,

1050
00:53:42.035 --> 00:53:43.953
we will all be lifted up,

1051
00:53:43.953 --> 00:53:47.803
but I teach meditation,

1052
00:53:47.803 --> 00:53:52.656
I teach working with energy, I teach being lifted up,

1053
00:53:52.656 --> 00:53:55.656
yourself, and it's a long journey,

1054
00:53:55.656 --> 00:54:00.156
and if you do it too quickly, people burn out or go nuts,

1055
00:54:00.156 --> 00:54:03.709
you can't raise the kundalini

1056
00:54:03.709 --> 00:54:06.509
in one quick movement,

1057
00:54:06.509 --> 00:54:10.609
because there are energetic blocks and patterns,

1058
00:54:10.609 --> 00:54:14.659
mostly thought patterns, which are very resistant to change,

1059
00:54:14.659 --> 00:54:18.709
and the release process, it's very deep,

1060
00:54:18.709 --> 00:54:21.809
it requires, it needs to be slow,

1061
00:54:21.809 --> 00:54:23.762
this is my experience, if somebody comes along

1062
00:54:23.762 --> 00:54:25.109
and says, "No, everything's changed,

1063
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:28.065
"and now it can happen quickly," I'm willing to look

1064
00:54:28.065 --> 00:54:30.265
at that, but it's not my experience.

1065
00:54:30.265 --> 00:54:32.965
If there is a cosmic wave of kundalini comes,

1066
00:54:32.965 --> 00:54:36.168
95% of the people are going to go nuts.

1067
00:54:36.168 --> 00:54:39.821
And because the reason being that

1068
00:54:39.821 --> 00:54:43.671
it energizes the psychic centers, and the psychic centers

1069
00:54:43.671 --> 00:54:47.471
are full of negative thought patterns, they get activated,

1070
00:54:47.471 --> 00:54:50.921
so the shadow is activated first,

1071
00:54:50.921 --> 00:54:53.221
the human becomes possessed

1072
00:54:53.221 --> 00:54:55.521
by the shadow of their own negativity,

1073
00:54:55.521 --> 00:54:58.727
and that kind of person is a danger

1074
00:54:58.727 --> 00:55:00.527
to themselves and others.

1075
00:55:00.527 --> 00:55:03.727
<v Regina>So if we really start this deep enquiry,</v>

1076
00:55:03.727 --> 00:55:06.236
whether it's at a high table systems level

1077
00:55:06.236 --> 00:55:08.386
or whether it's on a very personal level,

1078
00:55:08.386 --> 00:55:09.992
if we start this deep enquiry,

1079
00:55:09.992 --> 00:55:11.592
we have to be ready to go on a path

1080
00:55:11.592 --> 00:55:13.392
that could take us through the activation

1081
00:55:13.392 --> 00:55:15.892
of the shadow aspects of our own being,

1082
00:55:15.892 --> 00:55:19.142
our own agendas personally, and at large,

1083
00:55:19.142 --> 00:55:23.192
before we can start really creating a holistic solution.

1084
00:55:23.192 --> 00:55:25.592
<v ->That's right, so this internal work,</v>

1085
00:55:25.592 --> 00:55:28.442
which brings us back to the alchemists,

1086
00:55:28.442 --> 00:55:31.142
to the Egyptian practices, and so forth,

1087
00:55:31.142 --> 00:55:33.642
it was always necessary.

1088
00:55:33.642 --> 00:55:36.542
Now, in the early days,

1089
00:55:36.542 --> 00:55:38.995
people were connected to the land,

1090
00:55:38.995 --> 00:55:40.842
they were not so insecure,

1091
00:55:40.842 --> 00:55:44.495
they didn't live in a hyped-up sexual atmosphere,

1092
00:55:44.495 --> 00:55:48.054
so they weren't dissipating their sexual energy.

1093
00:55:48.054 --> 00:55:51.854
Who's training to conserve and store sexual energy?

1094
00:55:51.854 --> 00:55:54.610
As boys, we were trained to jerk it off

1095
00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:56.213
as quickly as possible, you know,

1096
00:55:56.213 --> 00:55:58.663
and it's like, what sort of preparation is that,

1097
00:55:58.663 --> 00:56:00.469
for meeting with divine feminine?

1098
00:56:00.469 --> 00:56:03.169
As any woman will tell you, it's about the worst thing

1099
00:56:03.169 --> 00:56:05.328
to train your body to do.

1100
00:56:05.328 --> 00:56:09.428
So then, our education system,

1101
00:56:09.428 --> 00:56:12.628
it takes away the personal power and authority.

1102
00:56:12.628 --> 00:56:15.275
That's what you teach, most fundamentally,

1103
00:56:15.275 --> 00:56:17.534
it's not subject matter, it's the form,

1104
00:56:17.534 --> 00:56:20.584
and likewise, the heart is disenfranchised,

1105
00:56:20.584 --> 00:56:24.784
the voice, how many people can freely

1106
00:56:24.784 --> 00:56:27.584
speak their truth without fear,

1107
00:56:27.584 --> 00:56:30.690
and then the whole division.

1108
00:56:30.690 --> 00:56:33.449
So all of that has to be repaired,

1109
00:56:33.449 --> 00:56:35.605
and it takes work.

1110
00:56:35.605 --> 00:56:37.105
<v Regina>And it's an individual journey,</v>

1111
00:56:37.105 --> 00:56:40.055
every single one of us has to start at some point

1112
00:56:40.055 --> 00:56:43.164
if we choose to be part of the lifting or the solution.

1113
00:56:43.164 --> 00:56:44.520
No way around it.

1114
00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:45.970
<v ->There's no way around it,</v>

1115
00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:48.032
and so that is the revolution that needs to take place.

1116
00:56:48.032 --> 00:56:49.332
<v Regina>So you're going to go back</v>

1117
00:56:49.332 --> 00:56:50.932
and tell those scholars in the board room,

1118
00:56:50.932 --> 00:56:54.332
"This is the reality, it starts at home."

1119
00:56:54.332 --> 00:56:55.985
<v ->Well, I actually think they,</v>

1120
00:56:55.985 --> 00:56:57.885
they are working on it.

1121
00:56:57.885 --> 00:57:00.835
<v Regina>Yes, that's good to know, that's good to know.</v>

1122
00:57:00.835 --> 00:57:03.488
Any final thoughts, because we're just about out of time?

1123
00:57:05.108 --> 00:57:07.391
<v ->I'm hopeful</v>

1124
00:57:08.821 --> 00:57:11.762
that here is a shift coming,

1125
00:57:11.762 --> 00:57:15.915
and I'm kind of--

1126
00:57:15.915 --> 00:57:18.521
despite all the indications, which look

1127
00:57:18.521 --> 00:57:21.180
like everything is going downhill,

1128
00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:25.380
suddenly I'm sort of feeling, we can do it.

1129
00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:27.989
<v Regina>I'm with you, and especially</v>

1130
00:57:27.989 --> 00:57:29.839
the last couple months, there's a brightening

1131
00:57:29.839 --> 00:57:31.542
of some kind that has occurred.

1132
00:57:31.542 --> 00:57:33.642
<v ->Something's happening.</v>

1133
00:57:33.642 --> 00:57:35.260
The shift is happening.

1134
00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:36.960
Shift happens.

1135
00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:37.763
<v Regina>The shift happens.</v>

1136
00:57:37.763 --> 00:57:39.613
Thank you so much, Peter.

1137
00:57:39.613 --> 00:57:40.816
<v ->It's my pleasure.</v>

1138
00:57:42.276 --> 00:57:43.772
<v ->To learn more about Peter's work</v>

1139
00:57:43.772 --> 00:57:47.572
as an ecological scientist and his stance on global cooling,

1140
00:57:47.572 --> 00:57:49.972
you can purchase a copy of his book, Chill,

1141
00:57:49.972 --> 00:57:52.472
via Amazon and other major booksellers.

1142
00:57:52.472 --> 00:57:54.825
If the official global climate story is falling short

1143
00:57:54.825 --> 00:57:56.625
for you, you might also enjoy

1144
00:57:56.625 --> 00:57:58.078
my interview with Michael Kaufman.

1145
00:57:58.078 --> 00:58:00.878
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
