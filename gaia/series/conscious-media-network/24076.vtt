00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:03.308
<v ->March 8th is International Women's Day</v>

2
00:00:03.308 --> 00:00:04.908
and we decided to celebrate it

3
00:00:04.908 --> 00:00:06.464
by talking with one of the founders

4
00:00:06.464 --> 00:00:09.088
of Gather the Women, Marilyn Nyborg.

5
00:00:09.088 --> 00:00:10.881
Marilyn says this group, which is

6
00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:12.939
gathering steam around the world,

7
00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:16.319
does not fit the profile of any other women's organizations

8
00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:18.570
in that they do not have an agenda.

9
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.191
They simply gather together,

10
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:22.027
uplift and encourage one another

11
00:00:22.027 --> 00:00:24.672
and allow the women's strength to begin showing itself

12
00:00:24.672 --> 00:00:27.798
in the outside world in its own unique way.

13
00:00:27.798 --> 00:00:29.750
Marilyn says, it's time for the story

14
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.839
of a women's value to change,

15
00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:34.367
which can be difficult in an unconscious world

16
00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.518
that still equates being feminine, with weakness.

17
00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:40.473 line:15% 
(light happy music)

18
00:00:43.371 --> 00:00:45.663
<v Voiceover>I love this quote, on the website</v>

19
00:00:45.663 --> 00:00:47.574
when you first come onto the website

20
00:00:47.574 --> 00:00:49.940
and it says, "if ever there was a time

21
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.754
"when women shall come together

22
00:00:51.754 --> 00:00:54.281
"purely and simply for the benefit of mankind

23
00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:57.600
"it will be the power of which the world has never known."

24
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.843
And that was by a 19 Century poet named Mathew Arnold.

25
00:01:00.843 --> 00:01:02.762
How appropriate.

26
00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:04.948
<v ->How amazing and what a wise man he was.</v>

27
00:01:04.948 --> 00:01:06.053
<v Voiceover>What a wise man he was.</v>

28
00:01:06.053 --> 00:01:07.367
<v ->Way ahead of his time.</v>

29
00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:08.064
(laughter)

30
00:01:08.064 --> 00:01:09.097
<v Voiceover>Let's get into</v>

31
00:01:09.097 --> 00:01:11.305
how Gather the Women came about.

32
00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:13.363
As I was reading about the history of it

33
00:01:13.363 --> 00:01:15.368
I came across one thing that really struck me

34
00:01:15.368 --> 00:01:17.801
was a little article by Carol Hanson Grey.

35
00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:18.803
<v ->Yes.</v>

36
00:01:18.803 --> 00:01:19.849
<v Voiceover>And I notice that,</v>

37
00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:21.865
I noticed the dates of the inspiration.

38
00:01:21.865 --> 00:01:24.605
it was November of 2001, when women

39
00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:27.113
had started calling her spontaneously

40
00:01:27.113 --> 00:01:30.205
to tell her of their visions that we needed

41
00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:31.805
to gather as women now.

42
00:01:31.805 --> 00:01:32.616
Right?

43
00:01:32.616 --> 00:01:33.628
<v ->Mmmhm, that's exactly right.</v>

44
00:01:33.628 --> 00:01:34.524
<v Voiceover>Right after 9/11.</v>

45
00:01:34.524 --> 00:01:37.004
<v ->Actually, I think, was it after 9/11?</v>

46
00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:38.961
<v Voiceover>I think she said November 2001.</v>

47
00:01:38.961 --> 00:01:40.333
<v ->Oh, I guess you're right, yeah.</v>

48
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Voiceover>Which would make sense</v>

49
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.808
'cause that was, a lot of that thought

50
00:01:42.808 --> 00:01:44.468
was going on at that time as I recall.

51
00:01:44.468 --> 00:01:45.345
<v ->Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

52
00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:46.592
<v Voiceover>Can you pick it up from there</v>

53
00:01:46.592 --> 00:01:48.010
and explain what's happened?

54
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.714
<v ->Yeah.</v>

55
00:01:48.714 --> 00:01:49.941
Well it's interesting because I called Carol

56
00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:52.640
and after, you know, out of the blue,

57
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.706
someone referred me to her.

58
00:01:53.706 --> 00:01:54.794
And I called her and I said, you know,

59
00:01:54.794 --> 00:01:56.980
I had this idea, it feels to me

60
00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.953
like there are so many women's circles

61
00:01:58.953 --> 00:02:01.674
that don't know what the other is doing.

62
00:02:01.674 --> 00:02:05.407
And that using the internet, which she is a genius,

63
00:02:05.407 --> 00:02:07.198
on, on that.

64
00:02:07.198 --> 00:02:11.123
We could be bringing those connections together.

65
00:02:11.123 --> 00:02:13.416
And she said, "Oop, others people are doing that

66
00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:14.856
"but I, we've got a better idea,

67
00:02:14.856 --> 00:02:16.329
"we're going to gather the women."

68
00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:20.500
And I went, "yes, absolutely, I'm on."

69
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.549
And, and there we were.

70
00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.834
We gathered, strangers really.

71
00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:27.894
I think 12 or 13 women came together for a weekend

72
00:02:27.894 --> 00:02:29.612
to say what does this really mean?

73
00:02:29.612 --> 00:02:31.146
What does it mean to gather the women?

74
00:02:31.146 --> 00:02:33.418
And why are we doing this?

75
00:02:33.418 --> 00:02:35.370
Well of course a lot of women came up with,

76
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.949
you know, we should be fighting poverty,

77
00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.232
and we should be, you know, looking at pollution

78
00:02:39.232 --> 00:02:41.013
and all, all the issues

79
00:02:41.013 --> 00:02:43.871
around war and peace and et cetera, et cetera.

80
00:02:43.871 --> 00:02:45.472
And as we went deeper, we said,

81
00:02:45.472 --> 00:02:47.700
you know there are wonderful organizations

82
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.048
already addressing those issues.

83
00:02:50.048 --> 00:02:53.385
There are very few that are really bringing women together

84
00:02:53.385 --> 00:02:56.062
across all kinds of, of divisions,

85
00:02:56.062 --> 00:02:57.962
to have a deeper conversation.

86
00:02:57.962 --> 00:03:01.034
And to reconnect with the value

87
00:03:01.034 --> 00:03:02.676
of what it is to be a woman.

88
00:03:02.676 --> 00:03:04.607
The feminine qualities within each of us

89
00:03:04.607 --> 00:03:06.793
to go to the deeper nature.

90
00:03:06.793 --> 00:03:09.182
And also that, part of what came out of there

91
00:03:09.182 --> 00:03:11.389
was that all of us were spiritually based

92
00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:12.990
and we wanted that to be the grounding

93
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.399
for Gathering the Women.

94
00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:17.767
<v Voiceover>When you, can you tell</v>

95
00:03:17.767 --> 00:03:22.300
how this has impacted the lives of people globally.

96
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.943
I mea, I mean I noticed you have workshops,

97
00:03:23.943 --> 00:03:26.129
not workshops, but congresses all over the world.

98
00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.504
<v ->Mmhmm, yes, we do, we do.</v>

99
00:03:27.504 --> 00:03:28.997
<v Voiceover>And give us a glimpse of</v>

100
00:03:28.997 --> 00:03:32.432
what has happened since this was formed initially,

101
00:03:32.432 --> 00:03:34.438
and how its played out in the world.

102
00:03:34.438 --> 00:03:37.112
<v ->Well let me say what I think is unique about us,</v>

103
00:03:37.112 --> 00:03:40.475
and, and for which some women have criticized us.

104
00:03:40.475 --> 00:03:43.643
We're not issue oriented, we're not saying to you

105
00:03:43.643 --> 00:03:45.840
take a stand on this or that.

106
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.164
We are saying to you, it is important

107
00:03:48.164 --> 00:03:49.882
to get beyond our differences

108
00:03:49.882 --> 00:03:51.931
and to come together as women

109
00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:55.897
for the benefit of all, of all people everywhere.

110
00:03:55.897 --> 00:03:58.640
And so, as my friend locally says,

111
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.221
"when women come together, wonderful things happen."

112
00:04:01.221 --> 00:04:05.818
And that has been our, our basic mission,

113
00:04:05.818 --> 00:04:07.278
is to bring women together.

114
00:04:07.278 --> 00:04:09.338
And, interestingly enough, what we're doing

115
00:04:09.338 --> 00:04:10.968
is very, very feminine.

116
00:04:10.968 --> 00:04:13.870
We are in, inspiring women, we are encouraging women,

117
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.821
we're encouraging them and supporting them

118
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:18.925
to find their passions, and to take their action

119
00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.440
from their own heart.

120
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.574
We don't tell 'em what to do, we often say,

121
00:04:22.574 --> 00:04:25.081
"we connect hearts, we're not trying to change minds."

122
00:04:25.081 --> 00:04:26.477
But we're connecting hearts,

123
00:04:26.477 --> 00:04:28.749
which is desperately needed on the planet right now.

124
00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:31.256
We're such enormous divisions everywhere.

125
00:04:31.256 --> 00:04:34.605
So what we do, then, is we, we invite women

126
00:04:34.605 --> 00:04:37.388
to create gatherings in which women

127
00:04:37.388 --> 00:04:40.247
from all walks of life can come together.

128
00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:43.103
To be inspired, to network,

129
00:04:43.103 --> 00:04:45.238
to hopefully to create circles of women,

130
00:04:45.238 --> 00:04:48.332
ongoing circles of women, so women will be supported

131
00:04:48.332 --> 00:04:50.625
in that effort to find their own empowerment

132
00:04:50.625 --> 00:04:52.938
and their own voice.

133
00:04:52.938 --> 00:04:54.623
Unlike other organizations, again,

134
00:04:54.623 --> 00:04:57.428
we trust the women when they're really excited

135
00:04:57.428 --> 00:04:59.658
and, and in touch with their own passion,

136
00:04:59.658 --> 00:05:00.798
following their own heart,

137
00:05:00.798 --> 00:05:02.751
they will do wonderful things in the world.

138
00:05:02.751 --> 00:05:03.507
Yeah.

139
00:05:03.507 --> 00:05:04.733
<v Voiceover>So really this is an emboldening,</v>

140
00:05:04.733 --> 00:05:08.124
the issues don't, the issues really aren't relevant then

141
00:05:08.124 --> 00:05:11.324
because as you're emboldening women . . .

142
00:05:11.324 --> 00:05:12.327
<v ->Yes.</v>

143
00:05:12.327 --> 00:05:14.481
<v Voiceover>and empowering women,</v>

144
00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:16.295
then they're going to take that forward

145
00:05:16.295 --> 00:05:18.385
in their own unique way.

146
00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:20.315
And start having their voice

147
00:05:20.315 --> 00:05:23.007
in the world of the issues of the day.

148
00:05:23.007 --> 00:05:24.305
<v ->Exactly, exactly.</v>

149
00:05:24.305 --> 00:05:25.574
And you know it's interesting to me,

150
00:05:25.574 --> 00:05:28.763
I think if, if, when a woman is really grounded in

151
00:05:28.763 --> 00:05:30.852
the divine feminine, that, that

152
00:05:30.852 --> 00:05:33.498
piece of self that kinda comes with the package

153
00:05:33.498 --> 00:05:35.472
that has been so incredibly dismissed

154
00:05:35.472 --> 00:05:37.092
over the generations.

155
00:05:37.092 --> 00:05:39.001
When they are in touch with those qualities

156
00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:40.975
and begin to speak from that place,

157
00:05:40.975 --> 00:05:43.221
it doesn't matter if they're speaking

158
00:05:43.221 --> 00:05:46.169
on, on two opposing issues.

159
00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.996
They will come to it from a different place,

160
00:05:48.996 --> 00:05:50.266
from a feminine perspective,

161
00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:53.177
which is much more about bringing things together,

162
00:05:53.177 --> 00:05:54.681
much more about compromise,

163
00:05:54.681 --> 00:05:57.465
much more about let's, how do we make it work,

164
00:05:57.465 --> 00:05:59.832
how do we solve these solutions together?

165
00:05:59.832 --> 00:06:02.765
Then, what we see so commonly out there

166
00:06:02.765 --> 00:06:05.273
of division and divisiveness, and,

167
00:06:05.273 --> 00:06:07.683
and the putting down of different opinions.

168
00:06:07.683 --> 00:06:10.104
So, we feel when women are in touch with that,

169
00:06:10.104 --> 00:06:11.769
they will speak from that place.

170
00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:14.724
And again, we trust that that's what will happen with them.

171
00:06:14.724 --> 00:06:17.411
And, I wanna also say that,

172
00:06:17.411 --> 00:06:19.949
I mentioned earlier that, you know,

173
00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:22.947
we know this, that so much or so,

174
00:06:22.947 --> 00:06:27.150
so much of our own feminine selves have been dismissed

175
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.957
by, by the culture, by the patriarch.

176
00:06:30.957 --> 00:06:32.855
And I would say that I think both

177
00:06:32.855 --> 00:06:34.178
men and women are,

178
00:06:34.178 --> 00:06:36.781
had been held prisoner by the patriarch.

179
00:06:36.781 --> 00:06:38.989
Men have been told they can't cry,

180
00:06:38.989 --> 00:06:41.421
they can't have feelings, they can't be sensitive.

181
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:44.119
And women have been told they have their place.

182
00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:45.953
And that stays in the culture

183
00:06:45.953 --> 00:06:49.228
even though we've had the vote for a little while now.

184
00:06:49.228 --> 00:06:53.001
There is this subtleness in the culture

185
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:55.649
that, that, that keep women down,

186
00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:58.230
that, that make it very risky sometimes

187
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:59.393
for women to speak their voice.

188
00:06:59.393 --> 00:07:02.315
Unless they're doing it from a male point of view.

189
00:07:02.315 --> 00:07:03.371
<v Voiceover>Right, which is,</v>

190
00:07:03.371 --> 00:07:05.644
in our congressional leadership for example

191
00:07:05.644 --> 00:07:07.201
and it's, it's very yang.

192
00:07:07.201 --> 00:07:08.919
<v ->Exactly, exactly.</v>

193
00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:10.572
And we're talking about now,

194
00:07:10.572 --> 00:07:12.215
bringing those two things together,

195
00:07:12.215 --> 00:07:14.359
within ourselves, not just the feminine

196
00:07:14.359 --> 00:07:15.862
but masculine feminine

197
00:07:15.862 --> 00:07:18.219
within each of us male and female.

198
00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:21.473
And so, bringing that out into the world,

199
00:07:21.473 --> 00:07:23.767
and coming from that place,

200
00:07:23.767 --> 00:07:26.763
for me it's sort of like the earth is crying

201
00:07:26.763 --> 00:07:27.980
for the voice of the mother.

202
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.164
<v Voiceover>It's crying for balance.</v>

203
00:07:29.164 --> 00:07:30.156
<v ->It's crying for balance.</v>

204
00:07:30.156 --> 00:07:30.764
<v Voiceover>And what we're talking about</v>

205
00:07:30.764 --> 00:07:33.059
is we've had an extremely inbalanced system

206
00:07:33.059 --> 00:07:34.400
for a couple thousand years now.

207
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.840
<v ->Exactly, yeah, yeah.</v>

208
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.133
<v Voiceover>That, I think, I don't think anyone can argue</v>

209
00:07:38.133 --> 00:07:40.127
that point anymore, male or female,

210
00:07:40.127 --> 00:07:41.312
it's way beyond that.

211
00:07:41.312 --> 00:07:42.965
We're out of balance and spiraling,

212
00:07:42.965 --> 00:07:44.543
some would say out of control,

213
00:07:44.543 --> 00:07:45.684
on many many levels.

214
00:07:45.684 --> 00:07:46.494
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

215
00:07:46.494 --> 00:07:47.561
<v Voiceover>Economically, environmentally,</v>

216
00:07:47.561 --> 00:07:49.758
and so balance need to be reintroduced.

217
00:07:49.758 --> 00:07:52.084
And so what you're saying is to find

218
00:07:52.084 --> 00:07:54.014
the harmony and balance between

219
00:07:54.014 --> 00:07:56.424
the masculine and feminine principles,

220
00:07:56.424 --> 00:07:58.078
which really requires extra effort

221
00:07:58.078 --> 00:08:00.467
to get the feminine push back up again.

222
00:08:00.467 --> 00:08:01.438
<v ->You got it.</v>

223
00:08:01.438 --> 00:08:02.558
(laughter)

224
00:08:02.558 --> 00:08:05.341
<v Voiceover>Okay, well and, and in ancient times</v>

225
00:08:05.341 --> 00:08:07.154
in Egyptian times for example,

226
00:08:07.154 --> 00:08:09.266
which is probably the last civilization

227
00:08:09.266 --> 00:08:11.517
we can point to of any advancement,

228
00:08:11.517 --> 00:08:12.775
early Egyptian days.

229
00:08:12.775 --> 00:08:13.746
<v ->Mmhmm, mmhmm.</v>

230
00:08:13.746 --> 00:08:15.590
<v Voiceover>It was very common for the women to rule.</v>

231
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.029
It passed through the blood lines.

232
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.714
<v ->That's right.</v>

233
00:08:17.714 --> 00:08:18.474
(clears throat)

234
00:08:18.474 --> 00:08:19.216
<v Voiceover>Excuse me.</v>

235
00:08:19.216 --> 00:08:22.338
Through the women, and also to be those of the,

236
00:08:22.338 --> 00:08:24.768
that held great importance in the temples.

237
00:08:24.768 --> 00:08:25.587
<v ->Mmhmm, mmhmm.</v>

238
00:08:25.587 --> 00:08:27.771
<v Voiceover>And so now, in what ways</v>

239
00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:30.375
do you see this rising more organically?

240
00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:33.895
<v ->Well it's interesting to me, I, I would, would add to that</v>

241
00:08:33.895 --> 00:08:35.132
since recorded history,

242
00:08:35.132 --> 00:08:37.264
which by the way was recorded by men,

243
00:08:37.264 --> 00:08:38.940
women have been left out.

244
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.404
And so I guess you might say many women

245
00:08:41.404 --> 00:08:42.652
have taken that personally

246
00:08:42.652 --> 00:08:45.670
and have acted under, under sort of, you know,

247
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.386
beneath the surface if you will.

248
00:08:47.386 --> 00:08:48.389
<v Voiceover>More manipulatively</v>

249
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:49.669
because it couldn't be done in the open.

250
00:08:49.669 --> 00:08:51.311
<v ->Yes, yes, that's correct, that's correct.</v>

251
00:08:51.311 --> 00:08:52.805
And, and what we're really calling for

252
00:08:52.805 --> 00:08:55.129
is the voice of, first of all for women, to,

253
00:08:55.129 --> 00:08:57.519
to discover their passions, to find their voice

254
00:08:57.519 --> 00:08:58.980
and to bring it into the world

255
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.377
wherever they may be.

256
00:09:00.377 --> 00:09:02.468
In their homes, in their communities,

257
00:09:02.468 --> 00:09:04.345
and certainly in the world itself.

258
00:09:04.345 --> 00:09:07.385
And that is, that message rings true

259
00:09:07.385 --> 00:09:09.753
for women around the world.

260
00:09:09.753 --> 00:09:12.238
For me personally, I've had the experience

261
00:09:12.238 --> 00:09:15.864
because I interfaith with so many people writing to us,

262
00:09:15.864 --> 00:09:19.598
I feel like I've, I've learned more about other cultures

263
00:09:19.598 --> 00:09:20.899
through the women I've talked to.

264
00:09:20.899 --> 00:09:23.266
And I've heard the common voice of all women

265
00:09:23.266 --> 00:09:25.826
crying out to be heard.

266
00:09:25.826 --> 00:09:27.149
<v Voiceover>Mmhmm.</v>

267
00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:30.508
And leaving the days of this, kind of,

268
00:09:30.508 --> 00:09:32.994
subtle manipulation behind and come out

269
00:09:32.994 --> 00:09:36.438
into the sunlight to express one's views

270
00:09:36.438 --> 00:09:38.432
on what needs doing around here

271
00:09:38.432 --> 00:09:40.683
because it has been, when I think,

272
00:09:40.683 --> 00:09:43.704
it happens with any, anybody, male female.

273
00:09:43.704 --> 00:09:46.817
When one is repressed, the only way

274
00:09:46.817 --> 00:09:49.047
to really have any effect is through manipulation.

275
00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:49.995
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

276
00:09:49.995 --> 00:09:51.202
<v Voiceover>And often times, women,</v>

277
00:09:51.202 --> 00:09:53.090
in all cultures, have been considered,

278
00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:55.127
oh women are manipulative,

279
00:09:55.127 --> 00:09:57.825
they'll use their whiles against you.

280
00:09:57.825 --> 00:09:59.820
Well, how else does anything get done

281
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.377
when you can't overtly come out

282
00:10:01.377 --> 00:10:03.041
and say this is what needs doing,

283
00:10:03.041 --> 00:10:04.854
we need to do it in partnership.

284
00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:05.857
Right?

285
00:10:05.857 --> 00:10:07.136
<v ->It's absolutely about partnership.</v>

286
00:10:07.136 --> 00:10:12.136
it's also about being aware of your motivations too.

287
00:10:12.224 --> 00:10:15.264
In other-words, you know, there an awful lot of women

288
00:10:15.264 --> 00:10:17.653
who are very, very angry about all of this.

289
00:10:17.653 --> 00:10:20.095
And so, what they do, they bring anger to it.

290
00:10:20.095 --> 00:10:22.249
And we really ask women, it's very important

291
00:10:22.249 --> 00:10:23.594
to look into your own heart,

292
00:10:23.594 --> 00:10:26.356
and be aware of what place you're coming from

293
00:10:26.356 --> 00:10:27.850
when you speak your voice.

294
00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.697
Adding anger to the world is not what is needed

295
00:10:30.697 --> 00:10:32.447
even if it's righteous anger,

296
00:10:32.447 --> 00:10:34.302
even if we all agree with one another.

297
00:10:34.302 --> 00:10:38.548
The anger itself, it has no longer a place in the world.

298
00:10:38.548 --> 00:10:39.634
<v Voiceover>There's enough of that.</v>

299
00:10:39.634 --> 00:10:40.712
<v ->There's enough of that.</v>

300
00:10:40.712 --> 00:10:42.398
And we really call on women because it is

301
00:10:42.398 --> 00:10:45.469
our basic instinct to bring about peace and harmony

302
00:10:45.469 --> 00:10:48.372
in the world with out children, you know.

303
00:10:48.372 --> 00:10:49.908
<v Voiceover>Right, right, and, and life.</v>

304
00:10:49.908 --> 00:10:50.900
<v ->And life.</v>

305
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.201
<v Voiceover>Preserve, preservation of life.</v>

306
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:53.108
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

307
00:10:53.108 --> 00:10:54.152
<v Voiceover>Let me get into this on a</v>

308
00:10:54.152 --> 00:10:55.892
maybe a little more esoteric

309
00:10:55.892 --> 00:10:58.345
and big picture level.

310
00:10:58.345 --> 00:10:59.507
<v ->Okay.</v>

311
00:10:59.507 --> 00:11:01.832
<v Voiceover>When you bring feminine types</v>

312
00:11:01.832 --> 00:11:03.966
of thought processes in.

313
00:11:03.966 --> 00:11:05.917
Well, plenty of women hold PhDs

314
00:11:05.917 --> 00:11:09.917
and can compete nose to nose on an intellectual IQ level.

315
00:11:09.917 --> 00:11:10.845
<v ->Right.</v>

316
00:11:10.845 --> 00:11:12.252
<v Voiceover>There is a different kind of thinking</v>

317
00:11:12.252 --> 00:11:14.440
that permeates the feminine mind,

318
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.878
which is non-linear.

319
00:11:15.878 --> 00:11:17.159
<v ->Mmhmm, mmhmm.</v>

320
00:11:17.159 --> 00:11:20.710
<v Voiceover>Which the world of science,</v>

321
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.748
quantum physics and beyond,

322
00:11:22.748 --> 00:11:27.675
is now acknowledging as essentially the way,

323
00:11:27.675 --> 00:11:29.809
the way the structure of life on,

324
00:11:29.809 --> 00:11:30.972
in the universe works,

325
00:11:30.972 --> 00:11:33.244
is in a non-linear fashion.

326
00:11:33.244 --> 00:11:37.894
Can you talk about how, what it's going to take

327
00:11:37.894 --> 00:11:41.253
for the, those in power to being understanding

328
00:11:41.253 --> 00:11:46.253
that non-linear thought is as valid as linear thought

329
00:11:46.575 --> 00:11:48.592
in solving problems.

330
00:11:48.592 --> 00:11:49.551
<v ->Yeah.</v>

331
00:11:49.551 --> 00:11:52.153
What I would say is that's really what our work is about.

332
00:11:52.153 --> 00:11:56.238
Is also, inspiring women to recognize that.

333
00:11:56.238 --> 00:11:58.607
The value of that non-linear way.

334
00:11:58.607 --> 00:12:00.280
I was thinking on the way over,

335
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.969
we recognize a man's value in that

336
00:12:02.969 --> 00:12:05.241
he has built this beautiful home.

337
00:12:05.241 --> 00:12:09.026
We don't realize that it, house rather, built a house.

338
00:12:09.026 --> 00:12:11.769
We don't realize that a woman makes it a home

339
00:12:11.769 --> 00:12:15.511
and it's less seen, you don't see the bricks, you feel it.

340
00:12:15.511 --> 00:12:16.992
And I think that what's ha,

341
00:12:16.992 --> 00:12:18.657
and I believe this is coming about,

342
00:12:18.657 --> 00:12:21.451
I mean, it's wonderful to see women taking their place

343
00:12:21.451 --> 00:12:24.949
I mean, for, for speaker Pelosi

344
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:27.178
to be, be welcoming the children,

345
00:12:27.178 --> 00:12:29.547
and her grandchildren's like, you know,

346
00:12:29.547 --> 00:12:31.712
an eye opener for all of us to say,

347
00:12:31.712 --> 00:12:33.684
oh, it's about time, what a relief

348
00:12:33.684 --> 00:12:35.776
that, that we are doing this for the children.

349
00:12:35.776 --> 00:12:39.340
And that is a purpose for being in power.

350
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.167
And I think that, you know I've noticed

351
00:12:41.167 --> 00:12:43.226
the new president of Harvard is a woman.

352
00:12:43.226 --> 00:12:44.666
And that is becoming a new,

353
00:12:44.666 --> 00:12:47.481
there is this wonderful wave moving now.

354
00:12:47.481 --> 00:12:50.008
it's, it's beginning to have a life of its own,

355
00:12:50.008 --> 00:12:52.867
bringing back these very, very

356
00:12:52.867 --> 00:12:56.462
long dismissed values that I, that,

357
00:12:56.462 --> 00:12:58.338
that we're talking about.

358
00:12:58.338 --> 00:13:00.642
And, one of my favorite books right now is,

359
00:13:00.642 --> 00:13:02.968
is also The Female Brain,

360
00:13:02.968 --> 00:13:05.911
which really talks about the distinction

361
00:13:05.911 --> 00:13:08.099
between the male and female brain.

362
00:13:08.099 --> 00:13:09.836
And when you understand that,

363
00:13:09.836 --> 00:13:11.852
it really validates that there are

364
00:13:11.852 --> 00:13:15.223
both value and differences between the two.

365
00:13:15.223 --> 00:13:16.504
<v Voiceover>Yes, and some women</v>

366
00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:18.007
were a little up in arms about this.

367
00:13:18.007 --> 00:13:20.513
Any time it's stated in any kind of work,

368
00:13:20.513 --> 00:13:22.380
whether it's some peer review paper

369
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.140
or a book that we're different.

370
00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.742
We are different and vive la difference,

371
00:13:26.742 --> 00:13:28.715
I mean, we need to have the balance

372
00:13:28.715 --> 00:13:30.623
of the masculine and feminine intellect

373
00:13:30.623 --> 00:13:33.321
to be able to fix these problems we're up against.

374
00:13:33.321 --> 00:13:34.943
<v ->Absolutely, absolutely.</v>

375
00:13:34.943 --> 00:13:36.574
And Jean Shinoda Bolen talks about that

376
00:13:36.574 --> 00:13:39.316
also in her book, and, and the work that she does,

377
00:13:39.316 --> 00:13:40.916
which is that, you know,

378
00:13:40.916 --> 00:13:43.539
basically we are all male and female.

379
00:13:43.539 --> 00:13:48.166
And while male dominates on one side with the female,

380
00:13:48.166 --> 00:13:51.113
within a woman that is the female that dominates,

381
00:13:51.113 --> 00:13:53.737
and also, we have the power of the male within us.

382
00:13:53.737 --> 00:13:55.411
We have many of those instincts

383
00:13:55.411 --> 00:13:57.064
that we can draw on ourselves.

384
00:13:57.064 --> 00:13:59.655
And we temper them, by, by our feminine

385
00:13:59.655 --> 00:14:01.031
which is the overriding.

386
00:14:01.031 --> 00:14:02.771
And I think those are, those are the things

387
00:14:02.771 --> 00:14:05.053
that we're talking about in terms of value.

388
00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:07.720
That there is a new way, and we, we talk a lot about

389
00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.378
the living school for feminine leadership, is what.

390
00:14:11.378 --> 00:14:13.223
Women coming in together, the women

391
00:14:13.223 --> 00:14:14.919
who are creating these activities

392
00:14:14.919 --> 00:14:16.913
and these circles and these gatherings

393
00:14:16.913 --> 00:14:19.612
are themselves walking stepping into leadership

394
00:14:19.612 --> 00:14:23.052
in a new way and finding themselves,

395
00:14:23.052 --> 00:14:25.446
really becoming empowered and the value

396
00:14:25.446 --> 00:14:27.900
of the fact that they're doing it differently than men.

397
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.202
We tend to sit in circle, for example,

398
00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:32.667
not in a dominant audience style.

399
00:14:32.667 --> 00:14:34.502
We, we try to encourage that we,

400
00:14:34.502 --> 00:14:36.047
we sit in circle at all times.

401
00:14:36.047 --> 00:14:37.883
<v Voiceover>So there's no real pecking order, obviously.</v>

402
00:14:37.883 --> 00:14:39.494
<v ->There's not a pecking order and,</v>

403
00:14:39.494 --> 00:14:41.253
and this is a lot to work with.

404
00:14:41.253 --> 00:14:43.247
None of us had been trained this way, you know,

405
00:14:43.247 --> 00:14:46.288
these are instincts we have to rediscover in ourselves

406
00:14:46.288 --> 00:14:47.408
and bring them forward.

407
00:14:47.408 --> 00:14:49.733
And that's really a lot of our work right now.

408
00:14:49.733 --> 00:14:53.541
<v Voiceover>And we're dealing with, I think in mass,</v>

409
00:14:53.541 --> 00:14:54.937
we're dealing with some issues

410
00:14:54.937 --> 00:14:56.814
of self esteem and confidence.

411
00:14:56.814 --> 00:14:57.646
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

412
00:14:57.646 --> 00:14:58.851
<v Voiceover>So for women to show up in a group</v>

413
00:14:58.851 --> 00:15:02.265
and feel that they even have the right to say something

414
00:15:02.265 --> 00:15:04.131
or that they're going to be heard

415
00:15:04.131 --> 00:15:06.051
or found to be interesting.

416
00:15:06.051 --> 00:15:08.397
I, I think that's a hurdle that everyone

417
00:15:08.397 --> 00:15:11.096
who shows up for these events has to get over.

418
00:15:11.096 --> 00:15:13.369
<v ->We need to begin witnessing one another,</v>

419
00:15:13.369 --> 00:15:14.649
which is I think the great value

420
00:15:14.649 --> 00:15:16.130
of a women's circle.

421
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.520
Is that, too often women report

422
00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.912
they were in a class that was 30 women and 2 men.

423
00:15:21.912 --> 00:15:24.952
But they themselves sort of allow the men

424
00:15:24.952 --> 00:15:28.204
to, to do the speaking because it's inculturated.

425
00:15:28.204 --> 00:15:29.249
<v Voiceover>Happens all the time.</v>

426
00:15:29.249 --> 00:15:30.200
<v ->We sort of like, you know,</v>

427
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.640
so when it's just women, and some women

428
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.996
are coming into our, our gatherings

429
00:15:33.996 --> 00:15:36.953
for the first time being just with women.

430
00:15:36.953 --> 00:15:39.520
Other than fashion shows or things that have been

431
00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.823
designed, you know, at a different level.

432
00:15:41.823 --> 00:15:45.674
But to come into a room filled with women

433
00:15:45.674 --> 00:15:46.932
and with that energy of women

434
00:15:46.932 --> 00:15:50.069
and with the values of connecting and relationship

435
00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:51.946
being dominant among those women,

436
00:15:51.946 --> 00:15:53.269
it's a different experience.

437
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:54.687
And being heard, you know,

438
00:15:54.687 --> 00:15:58.143
for the first time for their own opinion and valued for it.

439
00:15:58.143 --> 00:15:59.635
<v Voiceover>And there is a bit of a hurdle,</v>

440
00:15:59.635 --> 00:16:01.514
and this goes back to the brain,

441
00:16:01.514 --> 00:16:02.761
brain chemistry, the female brain.

442
00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:03.742
<v ->Yes, that's right.</v>

443
00:16:03.742 --> 00:16:05.918
<v Voiceover>And that is, Dr. Joel Robertson's work</v>

444
00:16:05.918 --> 00:16:08.969
is quite interesting, he's had over 25, 30,000 case studies

445
00:16:08.969 --> 00:16:10.452
on brain chemistry.

446
00:16:10.452 --> 00:16:12.104
And, as he states in his book,

447
00:16:12.104 --> 00:16:16.531
the average female brain, the average female

448
00:16:16.531 --> 00:16:20.573
has 12% less serotonin production

449
00:16:20.573 --> 00:16:22.408
than the average male brain.

450
00:16:22.408 --> 00:16:23.357
<v ->Wow.</v>

451
00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:25.011
<v Voiceover>Now, that's not good.</v>

452
00:16:25.011 --> 00:16:26.077
<v ->I know.</v>

453
00:16:26.077 --> 00:16:27.102
(chuckles)

454
00:16:27.102 --> 00:16:28.232
<v Voiceover>And this is because,</v>

455
00:16:28.232 --> 00:16:30.023
and he surmises, it's because of a general sense

456
00:16:30.023 --> 00:16:33.298
of powerlessness through the, throughout history.

457
00:16:33.298 --> 00:16:34.577
<v ->That's right, that's right.</v>

458
00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:35.965
<v Voiceover>Which is encoded in us,</v>

459
00:16:35.965 --> 00:16:39.058
it's encoded in us societally, in our family structures,

460
00:16:39.058 --> 00:16:41.425
it's subtle; the boys get the, you know,

461
00:16:41.425 --> 00:16:44.763
in past generations, even my generation,

462
00:16:44.763 --> 00:16:46.833
the boys would get the, the nod to go to college,

463
00:16:46.833 --> 00:16:49.339
the girls would become homemakers.

464
00:16:49.339 --> 00:16:50.545
You know, when I was a little kid,

465
00:16:50.545 --> 00:16:53.244
that's what we actually believed our role was still.

466
00:16:53.244 --> 00:16:54.663
Now it's changing.

467
00:16:54.663 --> 00:16:58.652
So, to create, to create that sense of self esteem

468
00:16:58.652 --> 00:17:01.691
will also literally give us, allow us to begin

469
00:17:01.691 --> 00:17:04.230
creating the chemicals for that, those feel good chemicals,

470
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:05.669
serotonin for example.

471
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:07.611
How do we stimulate this earlier in life?

472
00:17:07.611 --> 00:17:10.362
What is your group, what is Gather the Women doing

473
00:17:10.362 --> 00:17:12.495
to bring teenage girls into the loop?

474
00:17:12.495 --> 00:17:15.493
<v ->I, let, I wanna jump back a second.</v>

475
00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:16.282
<v Voiceover>Go ahead,</v>

476
00:17:16.282 --> 00:17:17.231
there's a lot of stuff I just brought up.

477
00:17:17.231 --> 00:17:18.064
Go for it.

478
00:17:18.064 --> 00:17:19.972
<v ->Is that it, it crosses my mind too,</v>

479
00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:21.946
when you watch children on the playground.

480
00:17:21.946 --> 00:17:23.759
That a little boy will say to another little boy,

481
00:17:23.759 --> 00:17:26.127
the worse thing he could say, "you're a girl."

482
00:17:26.127 --> 00:17:27.258
<v Voiceover>That's right.</v>

483
00:17:27.258 --> 00:17:28.302
<v ->You're a girl.</v>

484
00:17:28.302 --> 00:17:30.905
And a teenager either using fag as a way

485
00:17:30.905 --> 00:17:33.902
of describing a feminine guy, or,

486
00:17:33.902 --> 00:17:36.345
just by saying, "you're doing that like a girl."

487
00:17:36.345 --> 00:17:38.681
It's wrong, it's bad, our governor calls,

488
00:17:38.681 --> 00:17:42.009
calls his, his distractors girly men.

489
00:17:42.009 --> 00:17:44.238
<v Voiceover>Girly men, like it's the greatest insult.</v>

490
00:17:44.238 --> 00:17:45.305
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

491
00:17:45.305 --> 00:17:47.342
It is an insult in this culture

492
00:17:47.342 --> 00:17:50.669
to call a man a woman, or feminine in any way.

493
00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:53.176
It is not, though, for a girl,

494
00:17:53.176 --> 00:17:55.872
I mean very often all this is mixed, very often,

495
00:17:55.872 --> 00:17:58.647
a mother will say with great pride, of an athletic daughter,

496
00:17:58.647 --> 00:18:00.461
"she's such a tomboy."

497
00:18:00.461 --> 00:18:01.922
But what is this communicating

498
00:18:01.922 --> 00:18:04.482
to the brains of young boys, and young men,

499
00:18:04.482 --> 00:18:06.455
and to the girls themselves?

500
00:18:06.455 --> 00:18:07.938
So, that's number one.

501
00:18:07.938 --> 00:18:09.516
You asked about the teenagers,

502
00:18:09.516 --> 00:18:11.863
I wish I could say that we have been doing more.

503
00:18:11.863 --> 00:18:14.679
We want to do more, very much want to do more,

504
00:18:14.679 --> 00:18:15.905
but we're very young.

505
00:18:15.905 --> 00:18:18.944
And, also, what I'd, I'd like to say is,

506
00:18:18.944 --> 00:18:21.036
it's amazing what a few women can do.

507
00:18:21.036 --> 00:18:22.454
There have been from the beginning,

508
00:18:22.454 --> 00:18:26.240
really three women, and then eventually seven to nine women.

509
00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.160
So we have a small core of women

510
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.743
that are initiating these activities around the world.

511
00:18:31.743 --> 00:18:34.251
We now have been joined by 30 women

512
00:18:34.251 --> 00:18:36.683
across the United States who are taking on

513
00:18:36.683 --> 00:18:39.680
the responsibilities of what we call regional coordinators.

514
00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.210
And we are also, as you can see, are doing events,

515
00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:44.884
or in, not in, we're not doing them,

516
00:18:44.884 --> 00:18:46.782
we're actually inviting the women

517
00:18:46.782 --> 00:18:49.012
of those countries, to do events,

518
00:18:49.012 --> 00:18:51.358
Gather the Women events on various continents.

519
00:18:51.358 --> 00:18:53.289
We just finished, was this year,

520
00:18:53.289 --> 00:18:57.230
we've done in Canada in Vancouver.

521
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:59.475
And then in December, Africa,

522
00:18:59.475 --> 00:19:02.771
where over 450 women came from the bush,

523
00:19:02.771 --> 00:19:05.204
came from out of the most rural areas.

524
00:19:05.204 --> 00:19:06.046
<v Voiceover>That's fabulous.</v>

525
00:19:06.046 --> 00:19:08.648
<v ->And came into, and came together.</v>

526
00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:10.857
And it wasn't being run by Gather the Women,

527
00:19:10.857 --> 00:19:12.382
there were a number of us present.

528
00:19:12.382 --> 00:19:15.657
I, I wish I were there, but a number of us were present

529
00:19:15.657 --> 00:19:19.166
really as witnessing and as, as ways of connecting

530
00:19:19.166 --> 00:19:21.534
with our sisters there, we learned a great deal

531
00:19:21.534 --> 00:19:22.855
from that experience.

532
00:19:22.855 --> 00:19:24.787
The next one will be in Australia

533
00:19:24.787 --> 00:19:27.132
and that'll be followed by Brazil.

534
00:19:27.132 --> 00:19:29.032
And then next year we have others on the,

535
00:19:29.032 --> 00:19:32.360
on the docket.

536
00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.142
<v Voiceover>Who are some of your major partnerships</v>

537
00:19:35.142 --> 00:19:36.785
and alliances with right now?

538
00:19:36.785 --> 00:19:39.804
<v ->Right now I would say some of the major ones,</v>

539
00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:43.687
Millionth Circle, which is Jean Shinoda Bolen's work.

540
00:19:43.687 --> 00:19:44.732
<v Voiceover>And she's on our site,</v>

541
00:19:44.732 --> 00:19:46.032
she's a wonderful woman we interviewed.

542
00:19:46.032 --> 00:19:47.099
<v ->Yes, she's wonderful.</v>

543
00:19:47.099 --> 00:19:49.885
And in, well, let me jump back again.

544
00:19:49.885 --> 00:19:52.496
Often we are criticized for not doing

545
00:19:52.496 --> 00:19:53.840
or taking action in the world,

546
00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.377
and yet as I said, what we do is very feminine

547
00:19:56.377 --> 00:19:57.721
and not measurable.

548
00:19:57.721 --> 00:20:01.114
So one of them, for example, is Jean's connection with us

549
00:20:01.114 --> 00:20:05.102
that, her most recent book, came from the stage

550
00:20:05.102 --> 00:20:09.167
of Gather the Women, congress.

551
00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:11.256
Where she, where she gave a talk

552
00:20:11.256 --> 00:20:12.815
and from that talk came the book.

553
00:20:12.815 --> 00:20:14.372
<v Voiceover>What is the name of this newest book?</v>

554
00:20:14.372 --> 00:20:18.573
<v ->The name of the book is called Urgent Message from Mother.</v>

555
00:20:18.573 --> 00:20:19.917
<v Voiceover>Oh right, right.</v>

556
00:20:19.917 --> 00:20:21.752
<v ->Gather the women and save the world.</v>

557
00:20:21.752 --> 00:20:23.192
<v Voiceover>Yes, yeah.</v>

558
00:20:23.192 --> 00:20:25.262
<v ->And I, and part of that came from the inspiration</v>

559
00:20:25.262 --> 00:20:27.438
of seeing women are actually gathering to do that.

560
00:20:27.438 --> 00:20:29.346
Now certainly, I mean, go back and say,

561
00:20:29.346 --> 00:20:31.105
Jean has written about this for years.

562
00:20:31.105 --> 00:20:33.686
<v Voiceover>God's and Every Man, Goddess's in Every Woman.</v>

563
00:20:33.686 --> 00:20:34.806
<v ->Wonderful, awesome.</v>

564
00:20:34.806 --> 00:20:36.066
And her Millionth Circle offer women

565
00:20:36.066 --> 00:20:39.340
the opportunity to understand the ways of working

566
00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.866
in circle with one another

567
00:20:40.866 --> 00:20:43.052
in the creation of women's leadership.

568
00:20:43.052 --> 00:20:45.698
And she does that work around the world.

569
00:20:45.698 --> 00:20:47.020
<v Voiceover>And so, for anyone watching,</v>

570
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.438
take a look at our interview with her,

571
00:20:48.438 --> 00:20:49.441
that's also excellent.

572
00:20:49.441 --> 00:20:50.528
<v ->Yes, please do, 'cause she's wonderful.</v>

573
00:20:50.528 --> 00:20:52.225
The other one, is Piece by Piece.

574
00:20:52.225 --> 00:20:53.228
<v Voiceover>Mmhmm.</v>

575
00:20:53.228 --> 00:20:55.062
<v ->And you, you may know about their work.</v>

576
00:20:55.062 --> 00:20:57.429
And what they're doing is among other things,

577
00:20:57.429 --> 00:20:59.349
they're connecting circles of women,

578
00:20:59.349 --> 00:21:01.632
the women who are gathering in Africa

579
00:21:01.632 --> 00:21:04.395
and in other places on the world with circles here.

580
00:21:04.395 --> 00:21:05.600
<v Voiceover>Mmhmm.</v>

581
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.966
<v ->So that, you know, one of the great things,</v>

582
00:21:06.966 --> 00:21:09.386
the great issues in this country I think,

583
00:21:09.386 --> 00:21:12.052
is that we're very, very limited in our world view.

584
00:21:12.052 --> 00:21:14.378
And we, what we get from the news.

585
00:21:14.378 --> 00:21:17.396
But to have personal contact with women overseas

586
00:21:17.396 --> 00:21:20.553
and in other cultures, expands my world,

587
00:21:20.553 --> 00:21:22.964
and I believe it is an expanding experience

588
00:21:22.964 --> 00:21:26.057
for circles to say, "well we talked about this this week,

589
00:21:26.057 --> 00:21:27.892
"what did you talk about in your circle?

590
00:21:27.892 --> 00:21:30.143
"And how was your, how were your views

591
00:21:30.143 --> 00:21:33.300
"the same or different that what we, that what we did."

592
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.668
So there's, there's that communication between circles

593
00:21:35.668 --> 00:21:37.694
which they're doing beautiful work.

594
00:21:37.694 --> 00:21:39.668
<v Voiceover>Before we jump forward a bit</v>

595
00:21:39.668 --> 00:21:41.821
to National Women's Day,

596
00:21:41.821 --> 00:21:44.050
which the timing of this is perfect.

597
00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:45.213
<v ->International Women's Day.</v>

598
00:21:45.213 --> 00:21:47.186
<v Voiceover>International Women's Day, excuse me, yes.</v>

599
00:21:47.186 --> 00:21:48.114
(laughter)

600
00:21:48.114 --> 00:21:49.831
I wanted to just bring up the teen thing

601
00:21:49.831 --> 00:21:51.368
one more time, just briefly.

602
00:21:51.368 --> 00:21:52.275
<v ->Yes.</v>

603
00:21:52.275 --> 00:21:53.502
<v Voiceover>What would you say now</v>

604
00:21:53.502 --> 00:21:55.271
for anybody watching this,

605
00:21:55.271 --> 00:21:59.421
they might do to help bring younger girls in to this,

606
00:21:59.421 --> 00:22:02.418
into circles of their own, of their own creation

607
00:22:02.418 --> 00:22:04.274
that aren't there to bitch about their boyfriends

608
00:22:04.274 --> 00:22:07.617
and talk about the, you know, latest stuff at Sephora.

609
00:22:07.617 --> 00:22:08.917
(laughter)

610
00:22:08.917 --> 00:22:12.010
<v ->That actually opening the door for another interesting</v>

611
00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.912
invitation, there is group up in Bainbridge,

612
00:22:14.912 --> 00:22:17.856
I think Washington, run by Linda Wolfe,

613
00:22:17.856 --> 00:22:20.596
and what she's doing is teen talking circles.

614
00:22:20.596 --> 00:22:22.037
<v Voiceover>Perfect.</v>

615
00:22:22.037 --> 00:22:24.063
<v ->And she has written a beautiful guide</v>

616
00:22:24.063 --> 00:22:28.329
and she herself offers training for facilitators.

617
00:22:28.329 --> 00:22:30.399
<v Voiceover>Oh, what's the name of the guide, do you know?</v>

618
00:22:30.399 --> 00:22:32.330
<v ->Teen Talking Circles, I think, yeah.</v>

619
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:33.514
I believe it is.

620
00:22:33.514 --> 00:22:37.108
And you can do that by just Googling online.

621
00:22:37.108 --> 00:22:40.265
Actually, I think it may be TeenTalkingCircles.com.

622
00:22:40.265 --> 00:22:41.289
<v Voiceover>Mmhmm.</v>

623
00:22:41.289 --> 00:22:44.116
<v ->But, but she's doing, and she is one of our,</v>

624
00:22:44.116 --> 00:22:46.493
of our co-creators if you will,

625
00:22:46.493 --> 00:22:50.235
or one of our sister links as we are beginning to call it.

626
00:22:50.235 --> 00:22:53.278
She's working with teenagers, in circle.

627
00:22:53.278 --> 00:22:56.413
Groups with boys only, groups with girls only and combined.

628
00:22:56.413 --> 00:23:00.542
In which they have the freedom to speak openly

629
00:23:00.542 --> 00:23:02.077
about what's going on in their lives.

630
00:23:02.077 --> 00:23:04.979
We know, for example, that gangs provide a family

631
00:23:04.979 --> 00:23:08.392
for, for kids, which on the negative sense.

632
00:23:08.392 --> 00:23:09.064
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

633
00:23:09.064 --> 00:23:10.876
<v ->These circles provide another kind of family</v>

634
00:23:10.876 --> 00:23:12.850
for these kids where they feel accountable

635
00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.642
to this group for what they're doing.

636
00:23:14.642 --> 00:23:18.119
And the women and men who are being trained to run them

637
00:23:18.119 --> 00:23:20.796
are really first put through an extensive training

638
00:23:20.796 --> 00:23:22.599
in looking at their own teen years.

639
00:23:22.599 --> 00:23:25.456
And understanding what safety is for young people

640
00:23:25.456 --> 00:23:29.477
and how listening is the value of this, of this opportunity.

641
00:23:29.477 --> 00:23:30.705
<v Voiceover>Makes sense, and peer pressure,</v>

642
00:23:30.705 --> 00:23:32.284
getting past the peer pressure that

643
00:23:32.284 --> 00:23:34.257
this is beyond being a cheerleader

644
00:23:34.257 --> 00:23:35.953
and you're actually going to get together

645
00:23:35.953 --> 00:23:38.277
to talk about things more personal and substantial.

646
00:23:38.277 --> 00:23:40.966
<v ->Precisely, yeah, and she's doing some beautiful work</v>

647
00:23:40.966 --> 00:23:42.618
and I'd love to see that grow.

648
00:23:42.618 --> 00:23:43.942
And I know that there are other programs

649
00:23:43.942 --> 00:23:45.221
across the country like that,

650
00:23:45.221 --> 00:23:47.888
but this is the one we are most in contact with.

651
00:23:47.888 --> 00:23:49.957
<v Voiceover>Very good, well we'll put that up on the site.</v>

652
00:23:49.957 --> 00:23:51.344
<v ->And you know, what's one of the things</v>

653
00:23:51.344 --> 00:23:53.273
that I think is the value of what we're doing

654
00:23:53.273 --> 00:23:55.301
is that we're learning, because we bring together

655
00:23:55.301 --> 00:23:57.573
no only individual women, but organizations

656
00:23:57.573 --> 00:24:00.058
and groups and people who are doing different things.

657
00:24:00.058 --> 00:24:01.956
We get to know what they're doing

658
00:24:01.956 --> 00:24:04.378
and become a link for that.

659
00:24:04.378 --> 00:24:06.392
I'll tell you, I hope it's a quick story.

660
00:24:06.392 --> 00:24:08.804
One of the women I was in communication with

661
00:24:08.804 --> 00:24:11.545
was a young woman in Nigeria

662
00:24:11.545 --> 00:24:14.308
who wrote to say, "do we have Gather the Women there?"

663
00:24:14.308 --> 00:24:16.418
And I wrote back, I said, "no, you're it."

664
00:24:16.418 --> 00:24:17.422
(chuckles)

665
00:24:17.422 --> 00:24:19.469
And interestingly enough, within about a month,

666
00:24:19.469 --> 00:24:22.018
I received another note, from another woman,

667
00:24:22.018 --> 00:24:25.411
a Muslim woman in Nigeria, who said,

668
00:24:25.411 --> 00:24:26.552
"are you doing anything here?"

669
00:24:26.552 --> 00:24:29.219
And I said, "ah, no, but, Judy is."

670
00:24:29.219 --> 00:24:30.839
So, the two of them connected,

671
00:24:30.839 --> 00:24:33.005
and out of their work, they've created something

672
00:24:33.005 --> 00:24:34.722
called Circles of Concern.

673
00:24:34.722 --> 00:24:38.572
Judy then called me, and said, or wrote to me and said,

674
00:24:38.572 --> 00:24:41.495
"I'm, I'm coming to America, and what I would really

675
00:24:41.495 --> 00:24:44.566
like to do is find some place to, to do,

676
00:24:44.566 --> 00:24:47.116
kind of an internship, to learn something

677
00:24:47.116 --> 00:24:49.024
to bring back to my country."

678
00:24:49.024 --> 00:24:51.532
So I thought, what, I thought of different ways

679
00:24:51.532 --> 00:24:53.941
of doing that, but then I wrote to Linda right away

680
00:24:53.941 --> 00:24:56.876
and said, "would you be interested in having an intern."

681
00:24:56.876 --> 00:24:59.264
And then Judy came that following spring,

682
00:24:59.264 --> 00:25:01.355
and stayed there for about a month.

683
00:25:01.355 --> 00:25:03.275
And then came and visited us in Grass Valley,

684
00:25:03.275 --> 00:25:04.789
which was quite delicious.

685
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:05.834
<v Voiceover>Fascinating.</v>

686
00:25:05.834 --> 00:25:07.200
<v ->But again, that's, that's sort of</v>

687
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.525
the subtle unmeasurable ways in which

688
00:25:09.525 --> 00:25:12.896
so many of the links that we are making, are quiet.

689
00:25:12.896 --> 00:25:16.352
And, and not always, you know, big news.

690
00:25:16.352 --> 00:25:17.813
But that was my favorite story.

691
00:25:17.813 --> 00:25:19.157
<v Voiceover>That's a nice story,</v>

692
00:25:19.157 --> 00:25:21.269
and I'm noticing more, I read a lot of eclectic journals

693
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:24.222
that women in Africa, and also from the Muslim world

694
00:25:24.222 --> 00:25:26.890
are making some major breakthroughs societally

695
00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:27.935
and their cultures.

696
00:25:27.935 --> 00:25:28.585
<v ->Yes, awesome.</v>

697
00:25:28.585 --> 00:25:30.124
<v Voiceover>They're really out there,</v>

698
00:25:30.124 --> 00:25:31.871
they are winning major international awards

699
00:25:31.871 --> 00:25:35.956
in terms of environmental and otherwise and agriculture.

700
00:25:35.956 --> 00:25:38.793
So it's, it seems like it's almost taking hold

701
00:25:38.793 --> 00:25:41.204
in other countries faster than it is here,

702
00:25:41.204 --> 00:25:43.646
which brings us to International Women's Day.

703
00:25:43.646 --> 00:25:44.734
<v ->Yes. yes.</v>

704
00:25:44.734 --> 00:25:46.238
<v Voiceover>And the fact that this</v>

705
00:25:46.238 --> 00:25:48.140
is actually a holiday in some countries.

706
00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:49.023
<v ->In some countries it is.</v>

707
00:25:49.023 --> 00:25:50.105
<v Voiceover>This is March 8th?</v>

708
00:25:50.105 --> 00:25:50.732
<v ->Yes, yes, yes.</v>

709
00:25:50.732 --> 00:25:52.336
<v Voiceover>Can you talk about that a little bit?</v>

710
00:25:52.336 --> 00:25:53.469
<v ->I wish I could tell you the countries,</v>

711
00:25:53.469 --> 00:25:55.580
I, I know in Russia it is actually a holiday,

712
00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:57.725
'cause we, but, one year, we heard this lovely note

713
00:25:57.725 --> 00:25:59.048
from a woman who said,

714
00:25:59.048 --> 00:26:00.604
"thank you so much for Gather the Women.

715
00:26:00.604 --> 00:26:03.016
"Usually on International Women's Day,

716
00:26:03.016 --> 00:26:04.850
"the men bring us roses on Monday

717
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:07.911
"and then they yell at us on Tuesday.

718
00:26:07.911 --> 00:26:10.331
"This year we came together as women

719
00:26:10.331 --> 00:26:13.415
"and, and shared our stories and our support,

720
00:26:13.415 --> 00:26:15.324
"and it was different, so we thank you."

721
00:26:15.324 --> 00:26:18.289
And it was just, it was a lovely, lovely comment

722
00:26:18.289 --> 00:26:20.454
for the difference that it made

723
00:26:20.454 --> 00:26:22.640
in celebrating International Women's Day.

724
00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.720
It is, actually, International Women's Day

725
00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.302
has been around a very, very, very long time.

726
00:26:27.302 --> 00:26:30.257
I remember it being reinitiated, if you will,

727
00:26:30.257 --> 00:26:33.603
it 1975 at the United Nations

728
00:26:33.603 --> 00:26:37.478
First World Conference in Mexico City.

729
00:26:37.478 --> 00:26:40.559
And, and as I said, some countries have taken to it,

730
00:26:40.559 --> 00:26:41.702
and some haven't.

731
00:26:41.702 --> 00:26:43.931
This one is one, this country is one in which

732
00:26:43.931 --> 00:26:46.756
I, I wish we could say we, we hear more about it

733
00:26:46.756 --> 00:26:47.995
and we don't.

734
00:26:47.995 --> 00:26:49.636
And when we do hear about it in this country

735
00:26:49.636 --> 00:26:52.197
it is very often looking at our history

736
00:26:52.197 --> 00:26:57.197
and just honoring what has been done by women.

737
00:26:57.957 --> 00:27:01.092
I think we bring something different to it.

738
00:27:01.092 --> 00:27:03.546
And what I believe we bring to it is,

739
00:27:03.546 --> 00:27:06.286
is making it very current.

740
00:27:06.286 --> 00:27:09.145
And also that it is our intention

741
00:27:09.145 --> 00:27:10.702
when we ask women to come together

742
00:27:10.702 --> 00:27:13.229
for International Women's Day, to,

743
00:27:13.229 --> 00:27:17.038
to basically invite the future, if you will,

744
00:27:17.038 --> 00:27:19.565
within each women, to inspire, to connect,

745
00:27:19.565 --> 00:27:23.331
to plug them in to all the various activities

746
00:27:23.331 --> 00:27:24.771
that they could be involved in,

747
00:27:24.771 --> 00:27:26.563
and to encourage them.

748
00:27:26.563 --> 00:27:27.907
To create their own.

749
00:27:27.907 --> 00:27:31.180
We also bring to it, I believe a spiritual perspective,

750
00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:34.242
which is that we, we're not religious per se

751
00:27:34.242 --> 00:27:38.817
and we honor all cross sections of, of spirituality.

752
00:27:38.817 --> 00:27:41.421
But we also encourage women to listen to their hearts

753
00:27:41.421 --> 00:27:43.041
and listen to spirit.

754
00:27:43.041 --> 00:27:44.523
And ask themselves, you know,

755
00:27:44.523 --> 00:27:45.739
where am I coming from on this,

756
00:27:45.739 --> 00:27:48.055
am I, why am I angry?

757
00:27:48.055 --> 00:27:49.707
Or, where am I coming from on this,

758
00:27:49.707 --> 00:27:51.893
what is motivating me in this moment?

759
00:27:51.893 --> 00:27:54.966
Is it my agenda or is it my service to others?

760
00:27:54.966 --> 00:27:57.889
And so we continually ask women to check in.

761
00:27:57.889 --> 00:27:58.955
<v Voiceover>Mmhmm.</v>

762
00:27:58.955 --> 00:28:00.790
<v ->And to come from that place.</v>

763
00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:03.125
<v Voiceover>Any, this year, 2007.</v>

764
00:28:03.125 --> 00:28:04.521
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

765
00:28:04.521 --> 00:28:05.909
<v Voiceover>Anything major we need to note</v>

766
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:07.701
for International Women's Day?

767
00:28:07.701 --> 00:28:09.598
<v ->Well, I'm going to certainly encourage people</v>

768
00:28:09.598 --> 00:28:11.945
to look at our website, which is

769
00:28:11.945 --> 00:28:15.380
www.GatherTheWomen.org.

770
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.130
And there's a variety of things going on

771
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.263
and unfortunately we only have a few listed,

772
00:28:19.263 --> 00:28:21.256
but I know of more of them,

773
00:28:21.256 --> 00:28:22.771
we are working with women in Israel.

774
00:28:22.771 --> 00:28:24.159
There are two places in Israel,

775
00:28:24.159 --> 00:28:26.484
one working in interfaith community,

776
00:28:26.484 --> 00:28:28.596
one working in the peace community.

777
00:28:28.596 --> 00:28:30.729
I've been writing to a woman in Nepal

778
00:28:30.729 --> 00:28:32.841
for many years now, and she tells me

779
00:28:32.841 --> 00:28:34.909
what she's doing there.

780
00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:36.189
And for them, it's interesting,

781
00:28:36.189 --> 00:28:39.069
it's almost like going back to the 50s and 60s for us,

782
00:28:39.069 --> 00:28:42.536
they are on the streets asking for their rights as women.

783
00:28:42.536 --> 00:28:44.786
Rights, basic rights as women.

784
00:28:44.786 --> 00:28:47.773
I was called recently by a woman in the Congo

785
00:28:47.773 --> 00:28:50.726
who said they too are marching on,

786
00:28:50.726 --> 00:28:53.661
on International Women's Day for their rights.

787
00:28:53.661 --> 00:28:55.897
Each culture has a very different need

788
00:28:55.897 --> 00:28:59.173
in their expression and what their culture needs now

789
00:28:59.173 --> 00:29:00.634
to have those voices heard.

790
00:29:00.634 --> 00:29:05.532
In this country, we are, we have gatherings,

791
00:29:05.532 --> 00:29:08.257
gosh, my mind's going to all the different places.

792
00:29:08.257 --> 00:29:11.021
In Kansas City, there's a small group gathering there.

793
00:29:11.021 --> 00:29:13.186
We have a large group in Minnesota,

794
00:29:13.186 --> 00:29:15.245
in Saint Cloud, Minnesota, in Florida,

795
00:29:15.245 --> 00:29:17.900
in May and Boston.

796
00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:21.835
As well as Idaho, where a woman is actually planning

797
00:29:21.835 --> 00:29:24.646
a state conference for Gather the Women.

798
00:29:24.646 --> 00:29:27.434
And throughout several places within California

799
00:29:27.434 --> 00:29:31.264
and, golly, I'm, I'm losing all them.

800
00:29:31.264 --> 00:29:32.522
<v Voiceover>Yeah, we did go to the site</v>

801
00:29:32.522 --> 00:29:33.611
and see some of them.

802
00:29:33.611 --> 00:29:34.955
<v ->Yes, I wanna say, one, one other thing,</v>

803
00:29:34.955 --> 00:29:38.309
there's a wonderful participant in Canada.

804
00:29:38.309 --> 00:29:40.874
While we say we don't take stands on issues per se,

805
00:29:40.874 --> 00:29:43.124
I would imagine every women, woman that I know,

806
00:29:43.124 --> 00:29:47.027
including myself, has taken a stand, and do take stands.

807
00:29:47.027 --> 00:29:48.308
But one of the women up there,

808
00:29:48.308 --> 00:29:51.070
who's very active in politics, said recently,

809
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:53.321
she is fed by Gather the Women.

810
00:29:53.321 --> 00:29:54.707
That's where she gets her nurturing

811
00:29:54.707 --> 00:29:57.288
and her feeding and her inspiration.

812
00:29:57.288 --> 00:30:01.266
And I think that really summarizes what we bring to women.

813
00:30:01.266 --> 00:30:02.729
<v Voiceover>That makes total sense.</v>

814
00:30:02.729 --> 00:30:05.095
And I guess, we'll know that it's really taken seed

815
00:30:05.095 --> 00:30:07.347
when the day comes where we have

816
00:30:07.347 --> 00:30:09.533
International Human Being Day

817
00:30:09.533 --> 00:30:10.898
<v ->Oh, I love it.</v>

818
00:30:10.898 --> 00:30:12.434
<v Voiceover>because there is no more division</v>

819
00:30:12.434 --> 00:30:15.687
between those who have more power versus less power.

820
00:30:15.687 --> 00:30:16.616
<v ->Yes.</v>

821
00:30:16.616 --> 00:30:18.609
And I would hope that's what women will bring to the table.

822
00:30:18.609 --> 00:30:21.678
Is, is that perspective.

823
00:30:21.678 --> 00:30:22.862
<v Voiceover>Thank you.</v>

824
00:30:22.862 --> 00:30:24.892
<v ->Please feel free to check out our interview</v>

825
00:30:24.892 --> 00:30:26.780
with Jean Shinoda Bolen as well,

826
00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:28.561
who also speaks to the subject

827
00:30:28.561 --> 00:30:31.229
of the imminent need for the planet to begin embracing

828
00:30:31.229 --> 00:30:33.254
feminine input into the healing

829
00:30:33.254 --> 00:30:35.846
of our vast social and political differences.

830
00:30:35.846 --> 00:30:37.500
It's an inspiring interview.

831
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.123
Until next time, thanks for watching.

832
00:30:40.123 --> 00:30:42.624
(light happy music)
