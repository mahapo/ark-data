00:00:00.291 --> 00:00:04.941
(calm music)

2
00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:13.835
<v ->For any of you who were intrigued</v>

3
00:00:13.835 --> 00:00:16.616
with the EPAC time frame involving 2012,

4
00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:19.576
I believe you may find this conversation with Gregg Braden

5
00:00:19.576 --> 00:00:21.756
one of the most satisfying yet.

6
00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:22.879
As a man of science,

7
00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:25.620
Gregg has dug deeply into the lore and science

8
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.660
supporting the notion

9
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.500
that a great cycle of change is playing out.

10
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.961
This is augmented by a math technology

11
00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:34.381
that shows relationships between seed events

12
00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:35.802
and repeated events.

13
00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:37.685
In this mix is human choice,

14
00:00:37.685 --> 00:00:40.145
it's our choice according to Gregg

15
00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:43.135
as to the outcome of the 2012 phenomena.

16
00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:52.305
I love what you were talking about last night

17
00:00:52.305 --> 00:00:54.565
and I've been aware of your work for 20 years

18
00:00:54.565 --> 00:00:56.906
from before you even had official publishing

19
00:00:56.906 --> 00:00:58.352
and watched

20
00:00:58.352 --> 00:00:59.536
how you've grown.
<v ->Oh, you were the one?</v>

21
00:00:59.536 --> 00:01:01.634
<v Voiceover>Yeah, that was me, I bought that one.</v>

22
00:01:01.634 --> 00:01:03.674
And actually, you were the one that initially

23
00:01:03.674 --> 00:01:06.254
helped me understand that there were cycles of life

24
00:01:06.254 --> 00:01:08.494
and changes in geomagnetic changes

25
00:01:08.494 --> 00:01:10.754
and that's how it became introduced to you.

26
00:01:10.754 --> 00:01:12.494
You've expanded hugely from there.

27
00:01:12.494 --> 00:01:15.854
And last night, you had everyone magnetized to your message

28
00:01:15.854 --> 00:01:18.114
and that's really a keyword we'll get back to

29
00:01:18.114 --> 00:01:20.714
because you were saying it's not about

30
00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:24.054
this waiting for the other shoe to drop at 2012.

31
00:01:24.054 --> 00:01:25.774
2012 is a beginning

32
00:01:25.774 --> 00:01:28.554
but you backed off and said there's evidence

33
00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:32.514
that 2010 and '11 could be a little different story.

34
00:01:32.514 --> 00:01:33.354
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

35
00:01:33.354 --> 00:01:34.874
<v Voiceover>Let's just jump into the story from there.</v>

36
00:01:34.874 --> 00:01:38.454
<v ->Well, the story for me almost universally,</v>

37
00:01:38.454 --> 00:01:41.034
our indigenous ancestors

38
00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:43.474
view our world in terms of cycles.

39
00:01:43.474 --> 00:01:47.534
And the cycles unfold as cycles within cycles

40
00:01:47.534 --> 00:01:50.614
or what we call fractal cycles of time.

41
00:01:50.614 --> 00:01:55.234
So they look at the obvious cycles of a 24-hour a day,

42
00:01:55.234 --> 00:01:58.365
or the cycles of 28th day lunar cycle,

43
00:02:00.135 --> 00:02:03.095
the seasons, those are very obvious to us.

44
00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:05.755
But within those cycles, they have viewed them,

45
00:02:05.755 --> 00:02:07.875
our indigenous ancestors in the ancients,

46
00:02:07.875 --> 00:02:09.355
those who have come before us,

47
00:02:09.355 --> 00:02:11.635
they view those cycles as unfolding

48
00:02:11.635 --> 00:02:13.455
within even larger cycles,

49
00:02:13.455 --> 00:02:14.535
some of them thousands,

50
00:02:14.535 --> 00:02:17.715
some of them tens of thousands of years in length.

51
00:02:17.715 --> 00:02:21.795
Cycles that we in the modern world tend to discount

52
00:02:21.795 --> 00:02:23.795
and that modern science is only

53
00:02:23.795 --> 00:02:26.475
within the last years of the 20th century

54
00:02:26.475 --> 00:02:28.515
begun to understand the role of,

55
00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.635
the role that these cycles play

56
00:02:30.635 --> 00:02:32.095
in our lives and in our world.

57
00:02:32.095 --> 00:02:37.095
And the bottom line is that earth undergoes

58
00:02:37.377 --> 00:02:41.568
rapid profound changes on a cyclic basis.

59
00:02:42.978 --> 00:02:46.118
The cycles determined by our

60
00:02:46.118 --> 00:02:49.279
location in the heavens, our orbit, our tilt

61
00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:53.539
in the orbit around our milky way galaxy,

62
00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:56.159
the core, the center of our milky way galaxy.

63
00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.899
And one of the great mysteries to me

64
00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:00.159
is how our indigenous ancestors,

65
00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:01.919
first, how could they have even known

66
00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.199
that these cycles exist?

67
00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:04.359
I mean, who was around

68
00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.160
to track a cycle for 5,000 years or 10,000 years?

69
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.700
That's one of the first great mysteries.

70
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.200
But secondly,

71
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.820
the fact that these cycles exist

72
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.520
and that our own science now is confirming them,

73
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.903
I believe lends a continuity to our existence

74
00:03:20.903 --> 00:03:22.783
as a civilization now

75
00:03:22.783 --> 00:03:25.665
and to our existence as species on this planet.

76
00:03:25.665 --> 00:03:27.385
Because the kinds of changes

77
00:03:27.385 --> 00:03:30.285
that our world is going through right now,

78
00:03:30.285 --> 00:03:35.165
the extremes of climate, the extremes of weather,

79
00:03:35.165 --> 00:03:36.665
what's happening with our sea levels,

80
00:03:36.665 --> 00:03:38.145
what's happening with ocean temperatures,

81
00:03:38.145 --> 00:03:39.685
with air temperatures,

82
00:03:39.685 --> 00:03:42.687
our ability to grow food the way pollution shift

83
00:03:42.687 --> 00:03:44.887
and the way those shifts are driven

84
00:03:44.887 --> 00:03:47.128
by changes in our world

85
00:03:47.128 --> 00:03:50.728
is anomalous as those changes appearto us right now.

86
00:03:50.728 --> 00:03:51.887
In the near term,

87
00:03:51.887 --> 00:03:53.648
when we step back and look at the big picture,

88
00:03:53.648 --> 00:03:55.588
what we find is we are not the first

89
00:03:55.588 --> 00:03:56.547
people in this planet

90
00:03:56.547 --> 00:03:59.047
that have gone through these kinds of changes.

91
00:03:59.047 --> 00:04:01.128
Now for a lot of people

92
00:04:01.128 --> 00:04:03.528
who have not dedicated their adult lives

93
00:04:03.528 --> 00:04:07.084
to studying these kinds of phenomenon,

94
00:04:07.084 --> 00:04:10.785
the buzz word out there is about this 2012 end date

95
00:04:10.785 --> 00:04:14.064
of a cycle that was indicated and calculated

96
00:04:14.064 --> 00:04:17.904
on the Mayan system of time keeping, the Mayan calendar.

97
00:04:17.904 --> 00:04:21.425
While 2012 is really the catch word

98
00:04:21.425 --> 00:04:25.205
that everyone is looking at as a moment in time,

99
00:04:25.205 --> 00:04:27.824
these cycles are really about a zone,

100
00:04:27.824 --> 00:04:30.585
a window of change.

101
00:04:30.585 --> 00:04:33.105
And, so to answer your question

102
00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:36.224
for me as a scientist,

103
00:04:36.224 --> 00:04:40.244
when I saw the convergence of extremes

104
00:04:40.244 --> 00:04:44.024
that appear to be happening within our time right now,

105
00:04:44.024 --> 00:04:49.024
late 80's, 90's and now we're in the early 2000's.

106
00:04:49.385 --> 00:04:51.665
Well, I couldn't argue that they were happening.

107
00:04:51.665 --> 00:04:53.144
My question was why?

108
00:04:53.144 --> 00:04:56.564
Why would so many different things,

109
00:04:56.564 --> 00:04:59.561
the extremes in what we've always thought

110
00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:01.081
was the norm of our world,

111
00:05:01.081 --> 00:05:02.921
why would they all be happening

112
00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:04.621
in such a compressed period of time?

113
00:05:04.621 --> 00:05:06.698
And I quickly understood the only way

114
00:05:06.698 --> 00:05:07.818
that I could answer that question

115
00:05:07.818 --> 00:05:09.759
was to understand the cycles.

116
00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.758
So when we stepped back and looked at the big picture,

117
00:05:12.758 --> 00:05:14.412
what we'd began to see

118
00:05:14.412 --> 00:05:17.392
is that the unusual things happening in our planet now,

119
00:05:17.392 --> 00:05:19.550
do happen on a rhythmic cyclic basis.

120
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.228
And if we know how to look into the cycles of the past,

121
00:05:22.228 --> 00:05:24.907
we can give ourselves a reasonable,

122
00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:26.948
a reasonable idea of what we can expect

123
00:05:26.948 --> 00:05:28.467
rather than speculation,

124
00:05:28.467 --> 00:05:31.018
the guesswork, there's so much fear

125
00:05:31.018 --> 00:05:33.398
that's being perpetuated.

126
00:05:33.398 --> 00:05:34.916
Some of the ideas are well intentions,

127
00:05:34.916 --> 00:05:36.896
some of them are very manipulative,

128
00:05:36.896 --> 00:05:38.415
some of them are religious based,

129
00:05:38.415 --> 00:05:41.713
some of them are simply survivalist and fear based,

130
00:05:41.713 --> 00:05:44.814
some of them are misinterpretations of ancient prophecies

131
00:05:44.814 --> 00:05:47.954
from Nostradamus and Jeane Dixon and Edgar Cayce,

132
00:05:47.954 --> 00:05:50.073
the Hopi traditions.

133
00:05:50.073 --> 00:05:52.217
all of these are in the Mix right now

134
00:05:52.217 --> 00:05:54.157
channeling from off planet entities,

135
00:05:54.157 --> 00:05:55.617
everything is in the Mix.

136
00:05:55.617 --> 00:05:58.117
And they all benefit us.

137
00:05:58.117 --> 00:06:00.177
They all tell us something us something.

138
00:06:00.177 --> 00:06:02.557
But as a scientist, I'm looking for facts

139
00:06:02.557 --> 00:06:04.437
and the only way to understand those facts

140
00:06:04.437 --> 00:06:08.097
is to look and know how to look into the past,

141
00:06:08.097 --> 00:06:11.857
to the time when these cycles have happened before

142
00:06:11.857 --> 00:06:15.237
with the new information we have now

143
00:06:15.237 --> 00:06:18.577
so that we can see if we're truly living on anomalous time.

144
00:06:18.577 --> 00:06:20.797
And what find, the bottom line is that

145
00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:24.317
when we look into this point

146
00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:28.717
where we are right now, the end of a 5,125 year cycle

147
00:06:28.717 --> 00:06:31.040
that's driven by the precession of the equinoxes

148
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.540
that some of your other interviews have described in details

149
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.661
so we wont do that here.

150
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:38.601
But when we look into precisely

151
00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:41.021
such a time in cycle's past,

152
00:06:41.021 --> 00:06:42.841
what we find is the changes in our world

153
00:06:42.841 --> 00:06:43.841
or exactly what happens

154
00:06:43.841 --> 00:06:45.861
every time we go through the changes

155
00:06:45.861 --> 00:06:48.761
and our indigenous ancestors did their very, very best

156
00:06:48.761 --> 00:06:50.801
in the language of their day

157
00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:55.001
to convey to us the profound significance

158
00:06:55.001 --> 00:06:56.881
of what they experienced

159
00:06:56.881 --> 00:06:58.841
because they knew it would happen again,

160
00:06:58.841 --> 00:07:01.262
what changed in their world,

161
00:07:01.262 --> 00:07:03.923
but perhaps more importantly, what did they do

162
00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:05.903
to change something within themselves

163
00:07:05.903 --> 00:07:10.743
to help them deal emotionally, socially, culturally

164
00:07:10.743 --> 00:07:12.883
with the changes in the world around them.

165
00:07:12.883 --> 00:07:13.743
<v Voiceover>And what's interesting</v>

166
00:07:13.743 --> 00:07:14.684
is last night in your presentation,

167
00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:16.524
you were able to show some of the

168
00:07:16.524 --> 00:07:21.504
visual representations of both ancient Tibetan glimpse,

169
00:07:21.504 --> 00:07:23.824
it is laid over Mayan

170
00:07:23.824 --> 00:07:27.604
and it's virtually identical in helping us understand

171
00:07:27.604 --> 00:07:29.964
that we're going to be moving into another phase

172
00:07:29.964 --> 00:07:32.426
and as you say, the central theme was us.

173
00:07:32.426 --> 00:07:33.466
<v ->It is us.</v>

174
00:07:33.466 --> 00:07:35.626
And this is what I think is so important,

175
00:07:35.626 --> 00:07:39.626
it's not just the Mayans, or it's not just Hopi,

176
00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:41.666
there's this universal theme.

177
00:07:41.666 --> 00:07:44.246
If we know how to look and where to look

178
00:07:44.246 --> 00:07:46.887
the place out through

179
00:07:46.887 --> 00:07:49.027
the civilizations, the cultures,

180
00:07:49.027 --> 00:07:50.867
the ancestors of our past,

181
00:07:50.867 --> 00:07:52.423
they're all essentially saying the same thing.

182
00:07:52.423 --> 00:07:55.141
What they're saying 3,000 B.C.

183
00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:58.001
about 5,000 years ago at the end of the last cycle

184
00:07:58.001 --> 00:07:59.841
immediately when it was over.

185
00:07:59.841 --> 00:08:01.421
And this is a good news,

186
00:08:01.421 --> 00:08:03.801
it was over and everyone lived through it,

187
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:05.801
most people lived through it,

188
00:08:05.801 --> 00:08:08.211
to write to the people of their future saying,

189
00:08:08.211 --> 00:08:11.936
"We just experienced this thing

190
00:08:11.936 --> 00:08:13.016
"and this is what happened.

191
00:08:13.016 --> 00:08:14.953
"This is what have meant to us."

192
00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:17.615
I'm so in awe of the language.

193
00:08:17.615 --> 00:08:22.515
If we were to write to our future civilization today,

194
00:08:22.515 --> 00:08:23.816
what words would we use?

195
00:08:23.816 --> 00:08:24.596
What language?

196
00:08:24.596 --> 00:08:27.896
Would we even be speaking English 5,000 years from now

197
00:08:27.896 --> 00:08:30.299
when the next group of humans goes through

198
00:08:30.299 --> 00:08:31.046
where we are right now,

199
00:08:31.046 --> 00:08:32.099
I don't know the answer to that.

200
00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:33.039
<v Voiceover>It has to be symbolic</v>

201
00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.681
or geometric or both, yeah.

202
00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:38.201
<v ->Precisely, so when I look at the eloquence</v>

203
00:08:38.201 --> 00:08:42.841
and the simplicity of the visual maps of the cycles,

204
00:08:42.841 --> 00:08:44.821
of the pictograms,

205
00:08:44.821 --> 00:08:47.323
for example, the Hopi, the prophecy rock

206
00:08:47.323 --> 00:08:50.303
and how eloquent theses messages are

207
00:08:50.303 --> 00:08:52.223
and how well they've been preserved

208
00:08:52.223 --> 00:08:53.983
and how meaningful they are to us,

209
00:08:53.983 --> 00:08:55.507
I am in awe.

210
00:08:55.507 --> 00:08:57.430
I believe in our ancestors that conveyed this message

211
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.350
but what they told us,

212
00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.451
was it said, "Your world is gonna change.

213
00:09:01.451 --> 00:09:04.391
"And we can tell that the world will change,

214
00:09:04.391 --> 00:09:07.411
"what we cannot tell you is how

215
00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:09.391
"the outcome will look to you

216
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:12.911
"because it's being determined by you, people of our future.

217
00:09:12.911 --> 00:09:17.111
"You are choosing by the way you live your lives

218
00:09:17.111 --> 00:09:20.091
"in response to the changes you are determining

219
00:09:20.091 --> 00:09:23.111
"how well you survive and transcend

220
00:09:23.111 --> 00:09:24.851
"what those changes mean to you."

221
00:09:24.851 --> 00:09:26.071
And here's why this is important

222
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:30.052
and this is bottom line for me of everything we're doing.

223
00:09:30.052 --> 00:09:32.854
When we know where to look into the cycles of the past,

224
00:09:32.854 --> 00:09:34.354
we'll talk about this a little bit,

225
00:09:34.354 --> 00:09:36.134
through the geologic history of the earth,

226
00:09:36.134 --> 00:09:39.274
the ice cores, the sea floors, sediment cores

227
00:09:39.274 --> 00:09:40.874
that tells us the physical changes

228
00:09:40.874 --> 00:09:42.654
that happened to the planet.

229
00:09:42.654 --> 00:09:45.135
When we know where to look in the archaeological record,

230
00:09:45.135 --> 00:09:47.975
it tells us how civilizations

231
00:09:47.975 --> 00:09:49.795
responded to those changes.

232
00:09:49.795 --> 00:09:51.916
And what we begin to see

233
00:09:51.916 --> 00:09:54.156
and this is so profound,

234
00:09:54.156 --> 00:09:56.516
is that some of the greatest civilizations

235
00:09:56.516 --> 00:09:59.316
in the history of this planet that we're aware of,

236
00:09:59.316 --> 00:10:02.076
they collapsed and some of them disappeared

237
00:10:02.076 --> 00:10:04.496
when they reached the point in their cycle

238
00:10:04.496 --> 00:10:06.356
where we are in our cycle right now

239
00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:08.536
because they made a fatal mistake

240
00:10:08.536 --> 00:10:12.376
then, that I believe we can learn from and avoid now.

241
00:10:12.376 --> 00:10:13.656
And the mistake was this,

242
00:10:13.656 --> 00:10:14.916
in the presence of the changes

243
00:10:14.916 --> 00:10:17.336
that seemed anomalous to them

244
00:10:17.336 --> 00:10:21.017
much as to changes seemed anomalous to us today,

245
00:10:21.017 --> 00:10:25.560
and then their fear of what those changes met

246
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.540
and not knowing how to respond,

247
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.560
they reacted by competing with one another.

248
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.280
They said, "There's not enough,

249
00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.194
"everything's changing,

250
00:10:34.194 --> 00:10:35.872
"there's not enough resource to go around.

251
00:10:35.872 --> 00:10:39.009
"We're gonna grab the last vestiges of what we can claim

252
00:10:39.009 --> 00:10:41.329
"for ourselves and everybody else is on their own."

253
00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:42.524
<v Voiceover>Fear in competition, classic.</v>

254
00:10:42.524 --> 00:10:43.443
<v ->Fear in competition.</v>

255
00:10:43.443 --> 00:10:45.221
And those were the civilizations that collapsed.

256
00:10:45.221 --> 00:10:47.501
Everybody lost, nobody won and they disappeared.

257
00:10:47.501 --> 00:10:49.966
We've got archeological evidence on the border right now

258
00:10:49.966 --> 00:10:53.436
between India and Pakistan, what is now Pakistan,

259
00:10:53.436 --> 00:10:55.928
on the Rajasthan plains, advanced civilization,

260
00:10:55.928 --> 00:10:57.948
highly advance civilization.

261
00:10:57.948 --> 00:11:00.309
Hot and cold running, water closed, sewage systems,

262
00:11:00.309 --> 00:11:02.249
their cities were laid down in perfect grids,

263
00:11:02.249 --> 00:11:04.130
they have advance language, mathematics,

264
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.770
architecture ,science,

265
00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.560
they had glass windows, they disappeared.

266
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.730
The same thing happened just outside of Lima, Northern Peru

267
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.450
on the 5,000 year mark.

268
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:17.350
And I think there is something that we can learn from this.

269
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:18.770
<v Voiceover>Because it wasn't necessarily evidence</v>

270
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.810
in that particular region of some kind

271
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.388
of geophysical change that

272
00:11:22.388 --> 00:11:23.456
would have created it.
<v ->No asteroid impact</v>

273
00:11:23.456 --> 00:11:24.476
or no sort of flare.

274
00:11:24.476 --> 00:11:25.750
Well at least we don't see the evidence for that.

275
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.450
But what the archaeologists say and this is what's telling

276
00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:32.150
and specifically in the sites that we find in Turkey,

277
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.390
the burnt city of Turkey

278
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.606
is one of the oldest sites being recognized now,

279
00:11:38.796 --> 00:11:42.477
the site on the Rajasthan plains is that

280
00:11:42.477 --> 00:11:45.924
in the archaeological remains or remnants of the city,

281
00:11:45.924 --> 00:11:47.425
there are remains of humans.

282
00:11:47.425 --> 00:11:49.785
But they're all piled up at one end of the city,

283
00:11:49.785 --> 00:11:51.225
they were running from something

284
00:11:51.225 --> 00:11:53.145
that was happening on the other end

285
00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:55.065
and it's very touching.

286
00:11:55.065 --> 00:11:57.269
The husbands are clutching their wives,

287
00:11:57.269 --> 00:12:00.549
and the women, the mothers are holding their children

288
00:12:00.549 --> 00:12:02.610
and pets are all huddled together.

289
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.070
And the archaeologist term is

290
00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.970
that they are in impostors of flight,

291
00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.610
they're fleeing from something

292
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.710
and they left us a record in their language

293
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.330
that has yet to be translated.

294
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.230
This is one of the rare languages

295
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.611
to this day have never translated,

296
00:12:17.611 --> 00:12:20.371
it's called Indus Valley script.

297
00:12:20.371 --> 00:12:24.112
However, in that part of the world there is a record

298
00:12:24.112 --> 00:12:26.812
that is believed to be a fairytale

299
00:12:26.812 --> 00:12:29.232
of a great battle that happened a long time ago.

300
00:12:29.232 --> 00:12:31.292
It's in the 100,000 verses

301
00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:33.053
and what is now called the Mahabharata,

302
00:12:33.053 --> 00:12:35.593
the Hindu epic of the Mahabharata,

303
00:12:35.593 --> 00:12:38.193
that happens to have occurred precisely on

304
00:12:38.193 --> 00:12:39.733
the Rajasthan plains, in the place

305
00:12:39.733 --> 00:12:42.253
where this archaeological site is now being found.

306
00:12:42.253 --> 00:12:45.013
And it's all about a great battle that happened

307
00:12:45.013 --> 00:12:48.973
between two elements of a highly advance civilization

308
00:12:48.973 --> 00:12:51.593
where a weapon was used,

309
00:12:51.593 --> 00:12:53.833
that had never been used before.

310
00:12:53.833 --> 00:12:56.613
And we don't know exactly what happened there.

311
00:12:56.613 --> 00:12:57.673
But something happened

312
00:12:57.673 --> 00:12:59.373
and it happened to humans.

313
00:12:59.373 --> 00:13:00.573
<v Voiceover>And the point is that is was</v>

314
00:13:00.573 --> 00:13:01.900
fear in competition--

315
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.137
<v ->The competition and the fear</v>

316
00:13:04.137 --> 00:13:06.077
and that's what we see in the other sites.

317
00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:08.997
So we look at the patterns,

318
00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:11.997
and I'm not saying we are re-living precisely the patterns

319
00:13:11.997 --> 00:13:13.957
but the general themes

320
00:13:13.957 --> 00:13:16.357
where we are right now, our world is changing,

321
00:13:16.357 --> 00:13:18.397
some people are better equipped to deal within others,

322
00:13:18.397 --> 00:13:20.434
but we're family on this planet.

323
00:13:20.434 --> 00:13:22.982
And my sense is that if we can,

324
00:13:22.982 --> 00:13:26.243
if we can honor the principle of the family that we are,

325
00:13:26.243 --> 00:13:28.963
I'm encouraged, I think that's what happening

326
00:13:28.963 --> 00:13:30.983
and worked together as individuals,

327
00:13:30.983 --> 00:13:34.524
in our communities work together as nations.

328
00:13:34.524 --> 00:13:36.104
This morning I woke up,

329
00:13:36.104 --> 00:13:38.671
I'm gonna date our film here a little bit

330
00:13:38.671 --> 00:13:40.671
but I woke up, turn on the news

331
00:13:40.671 --> 00:13:41.871
and I saw something very touching.

332
00:13:41.871 --> 00:13:44.084
I don't know if you saw this today or not,

333
00:13:44.084 --> 00:13:45.315
two former presidents

334
00:13:45.315 --> 00:13:46.895
were standing with our current president

335
00:13:46.895 --> 00:13:49.915
so it's Bill Clinton,

336
00:13:49.915 --> 00:13:51.995
George W. Bush,

337
00:13:51.995 --> 00:13:53.755
and president Obama.

338
00:13:53.755 --> 00:13:55.855
They had all their arms around one another

339
00:13:55.855 --> 00:13:59.655
and they were emotionally declaring

340
00:13:59.655 --> 00:14:02.235
that they would work together with the nations of the world

341
00:14:02.235 --> 00:14:05.375
to pull Haiti through this disaster.

342
00:14:05.375 --> 00:14:07.035
Even when the new cycles fade

343
00:14:07.035 --> 00:14:08.615
and they go on to another story, they said,

344
00:14:08.615 --> 00:14:10.375
"We're gonna keep this thing current

345
00:14:10.375 --> 00:14:11.415
"and we're gonna do this well,

346
00:14:11.415 --> 00:14:12.835
"we're gonna do it really right."

347
00:14:12.835 --> 00:14:15.617
Because it hasn't always been well and right in the past

348
00:14:15.617 --> 00:14:17.957
and they deserve that.

349
00:14:17.957 --> 00:14:19.138
And they laid out a plan.

350
00:14:19.138 --> 00:14:21.278
And to see those three men working together

351
00:14:21.278 --> 00:14:24.938
who I know ideologically haven't always agreed

352
00:14:24.938 --> 00:14:25.858
but they agreed on this

353
00:14:25.858 --> 00:14:28.638
and I could tell they had lot of respect for one another.

354
00:14:28.638 --> 00:14:30.099
And I think

355
00:14:30.099 --> 00:14:31.420
I only agree with everything they've done in the past

356
00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.380
but I think there is something, something changed

357
00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.520
and something really beautiful was happening.

358
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.420
<v Voiceover>You were saying something</v>

359
00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.400
that felt like authentic emotion?

360
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.600
<v ->I was personally.</v>

361
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.820
Personally I was

362
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.560
and I'm encouraged by that.

363
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.880
So I think I, my senses

364
00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.920
that where we are right now,

365
00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.740
our world is changing so quickly,

366
00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.180
faster than we can document in the textbooks,

367
00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.300
teach it in our classrooms,

368
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.480
the world change so quickly.

369
00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.060
I have to say this really carefully that

370
00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:06.060
the power structures of corporations and government,

371
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.980
I believe, are struggling to reconcile

372
00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:15.341
a way of being in doing business that's worked for 200 years

373
00:15:15.341 --> 00:15:18.921
and a way that they've grown accustomed to.

374
00:15:18.921 --> 00:15:21.661
They're struggling to reconcile that

375
00:15:21.661 --> 00:15:25.121
to meet the demands of a word that change quicker

376
00:15:25.121 --> 00:15:27.681
than they knew to how to accommodate.

377
00:15:27.681 --> 00:15:29.401
<v Voiceover>They would appear to be a lot of evidence</v>

378
00:15:29.401 --> 00:15:30.401
to support that.

379
00:15:30.401 --> 00:15:31.401
<v ->I'm not saying that they didn't know</v>

380
00:15:31.401 --> 00:15:32.201
the world was changing

381
00:15:32.201 --> 00:15:34.461
but I think the world change even quicker

382
00:15:34.461 --> 00:15:38.781
than those individuals believed would

383
00:15:38.781 --> 00:15:40.801
and perhaps moved in the direction

384
00:15:40.801 --> 00:15:43.421
that was a little different than what they had expected.

385
00:15:43.421 --> 00:15:45.041
So in a sense the reason I say that,

386
00:15:45.041 --> 00:15:49.222
in the sense where an uncharted territory as a civilization

387
00:15:49.222 --> 00:15:51.942
culturally, socially and as individuals

388
00:15:51.942 --> 00:15:53.222
unless we have the wisdom

389
00:15:53.222 --> 00:15:55.102
to look at the past and the patterns

390
00:15:55.102 --> 00:15:57.165
and then we say we're not in an uncharted territory,

391
00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:59.528
it's just rare but there's a precedent.

392
00:15:59.528 --> 00:16:01.468
<v Voiceover>There was something else</v>

393
00:16:01.468 --> 00:16:03.608
you talked about last night within that.

394
00:16:03.608 --> 00:16:05.488
We have to again look back to these cycles

395
00:16:05.488 --> 00:16:08.816
so we'll just for a moment get back into the cycles--

396
00:16:08.816 --> 00:16:10.516
<v ->So that was a long answer to your short question--</v>

397
00:16:10.516 --> 00:16:11.208
<v Voiceover>No.</v>

398
00:16:11.208 --> 00:16:13.228
Give me lots of long answers there's just,

399
00:16:13.228 --> 00:16:14.585
I thought I'd just go ahead

400
00:16:14.585 --> 00:16:17.446
and put this wee bit back in.

401
00:16:17.446 --> 00:16:19.626
Talking about the indigenous peoples

402
00:16:19.626 --> 00:16:22.548
understanding these great cycles, this understanding,

403
00:16:22.548 --> 00:16:25.088
this wisdom was passed on obviously

404
00:16:25.088 --> 00:16:26.968
through the travel structure,

405
00:16:26.968 --> 00:16:28.888
the structure of the peoples of today

406
00:16:28.888 --> 00:16:32.548
and when you had a situation that was so beautiful

407
00:16:32.548 --> 00:16:34.690
and touching when you showed this last night,

408
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:38.850
it's the woman that had emerged from the tent,

409
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:39.910
where were you?

410
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.610
You were up and she was beautiful.

411
00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.111
A lone woman attending her,

412
00:16:44.111 --> 00:16:45.412
I don't know if it was goats or yaks.

413
00:16:45.412 --> 00:16:46.053
<v ->Yak.</v>

414
00:16:46.053 --> 00:16:47.013
<v Voiceover>Yaks.</v>

415
00:16:47.013 --> 00:16:48.206
Her yak.

416
00:16:49.053 --> 00:16:50.576
<v ->It was1998.</v>

417
00:16:50.576 --> 00:16:52.536
<v Voiceover>Beyond remote area.</v>

418
00:16:52.536 --> 00:16:53.976
And she emerged and told you something that

419
00:16:53.976 --> 00:16:56.156
I thought was just amazing.

420
00:16:56.156 --> 00:16:58.596
<v ->I was with a group in the highlands</v>

421
00:16:58.596 --> 00:17:01.016
of the Western Tibetan plateau,

422
00:17:01.016 --> 00:17:03.887
we were six days out of the capital of Lhasa,

423
00:17:05.317 --> 00:17:08.617
moving up in elevation toward the Nepalese border

424
00:17:08.617 --> 00:17:12.417
which is on the other side of the mountain range.

425
00:17:12.417 --> 00:17:15.297
And we had stopped in the pass, there's a mountain pass

426
00:17:15.297 --> 00:17:17.077
and I believe it's around 16,000 feet,

427
00:17:17.077 --> 00:17:20.639
above 15,500, 16,000 feet above sea level,

428
00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:22.199
where they don't see a lot of company,

429
00:17:22.199 --> 00:17:24.119
they don't have a lot of guest there.

430
00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:27.819
And we stopped in a big Chinese bus

431
00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:29.679
and pulled off the side of the road

432
00:17:29.679 --> 00:17:32.604
and this woman walked out of the yak haired tent,

433
00:17:32.604 --> 00:17:35.024
she's all by herself and--

434
00:17:35.024 --> 00:17:36.264
<v Voiceover>There was nothing else around her?</v>

435
00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:38.866
<v ->Well, her yak were there but you couldn't see it.</v>

436
00:17:38.866 --> 00:17:40.186
And they were really good looking yak,

437
00:17:40.186 --> 00:17:41.586
I want you to know.

438
00:17:41.586 --> 00:17:42.488
<v Voiceover>Ultra yak?</v>

439
00:17:42.488 --> 00:17:43.608
<v ->Beautiful yak, yes.</v>

440
00:17:43.608 --> 00:17:46.049
But she came up to us and then there was a clarity

441
00:17:46.049 --> 00:17:48.489
and you saw it in her face in the photographs,

442
00:17:48.489 --> 00:17:52.091
clear white eyes, that means she just stared right at us

443
00:17:52.091 --> 00:17:54.192
and after she asked why we were there,

444
00:17:54.192 --> 00:17:56.034
she asked a question to the translator.

445
00:17:56.034 --> 00:17:57.276
She said, "Do you know how special this time

446
00:17:57.276 --> 00:17:59.496
"in the history of our planet is?"

447
00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:01.016
And I wanted to hear her story

448
00:18:01.016 --> 00:18:03.056
so I said, "No, tell me."

449
00:18:03.056 --> 00:18:04.836
"Tell me what you know."

450
00:18:04.836 --> 00:18:06.636
And she began a story.

451
00:18:06.636 --> 00:18:10.436
And she said for generations her ancestors had told them

452
00:18:10.436 --> 00:18:11.756
that the change was coming

453
00:18:11.756 --> 00:18:13.336
and how would they know

454
00:18:13.336 --> 00:18:14.976
that the change was there

455
00:18:14.976 --> 00:18:18.336
'cause they're not satellites and GPS and,

456
00:18:18.336 --> 00:18:20.989
looking at the kinds of phenomena we're looking at.

457
00:18:20.989 --> 00:18:23.350
They're looking at things that are familiar to them.

458
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.389
And she said, "When our ancestors told us

459
00:18:25.389 --> 00:18:26.947
"that when we stand on the rock,"

460
00:18:26.947 --> 00:18:29.847
and she pointed down to the bottom of this cliff,

461
00:18:29.847 --> 00:18:31.427
"When we stand on the rock

462
00:18:31.427 --> 00:18:33.667
"and we can no longer reach up and touch the ice,

463
00:18:33.667 --> 00:18:35.248
"the bottom of the glacier

464
00:18:35.248 --> 00:18:36.771
"that was coming down that mountain,

465
00:18:36.771 --> 00:18:38.244
"well, we can't do that anymore,

466
00:18:38.244 --> 00:18:39.720
"that means the time to change has come,

467
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.761
"we need to move our herds

468
00:18:40.761 --> 00:18:42.361
"and we need to prepare ourselves

469
00:18:42.361 --> 00:18:45.561
"and live differently than we have all of these years."

470
00:18:45.561 --> 00:18:47.601
On 1998, global warming

471
00:18:47.601 --> 00:18:51.700
had caused that glacier to recede about 30, 35 feet

472
00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.696
from where it was and I couldn't touch it anymore.

473
00:18:53.696 --> 00:18:55.517
And that was one of the reasons she was

474
00:18:55.517 --> 00:18:57.277
one of the last people there.

475
00:18:57.277 --> 00:18:59.154
It's seasonal but most the other people had left

476
00:18:59.154 --> 00:19:00.934
and they were going for lower elevations

477
00:19:00.934 --> 00:19:02.712
and they were preparing for change.

478
00:19:02.712 --> 00:19:03.951
<v Voiceover>Which is interesting,</v>

479
00:19:03.951 --> 00:19:04.989
you go head, sorry.
<v ->Well, the point was</v>

480
00:19:04.989 --> 00:19:09.043
that their culture allows for it as so many do,

481
00:19:09.043 --> 00:19:11.597
it's like the great secret everybody knows but us.

482
00:19:11.597 --> 00:19:14.267
And we are just now catching on,

483
00:19:14.267 --> 00:19:16.814
we, being not your listeners and not you and I

484
00:19:16.814 --> 00:19:20.422
but we as the Western world in modern science.

485
00:19:20.422 --> 00:19:21.962
And now that we're catching on,

486
00:19:21.962 --> 00:19:24.440
we're catching on and trying to describe it

487
00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.199
from a scientific perspective

488
00:19:26.199 --> 00:19:28.456
but there are personal and social implications

489
00:19:28.456 --> 00:19:31.293
that I think science isn't really addressing right now.

490
00:19:31.293 --> 00:19:32.493
<v Voiceover>And you had at the same time</v>

491
00:19:32.493 --> 00:19:34.433
the media would take it and run with it

492
00:19:34.433 --> 00:19:36.433
and say, yes we're in this dizzey period of time,

493
00:19:36.433 --> 00:19:39.193
we've created it because of our carbon emissions

494
00:19:39.193 --> 00:19:39.873
and so forth.

495
00:19:39.873 --> 00:19:42.274
I mean it gets very complex because that's not to say

496
00:19:42.274 --> 00:19:44.794
that we have not caused a tremendous amount of damage

497
00:19:44.794 --> 00:19:46.594
and pollution on this planet.

498
00:19:46.594 --> 00:19:49.494
At the same time, it is also not to say

499
00:19:49.494 --> 00:19:51.514
that we are totally responsible

500
00:19:51.514 --> 00:19:53.293
for these anomalous changes happening

501
00:19:53.293 --> 00:19:55.233
all around us now.

502
00:19:55.233 --> 00:19:58.513
<v ->From what I'm seeing of the cycles,</v>

503
00:19:58.513 --> 00:20:00.912
and I have to be really careful, it's such a delicate issue

504
00:20:00.912 --> 00:20:05.912
and it has been hijacked and made into a political issue.

505
00:20:05.932 --> 00:20:10.932
The bottom line is that people's lives and way of life

506
00:20:11.852 --> 00:20:12.932
is at risk right now.

507
00:20:12.932 --> 00:20:16.292
People are loosing their lives because of the changes.

508
00:20:16.292 --> 00:20:18.275
We have done a tremendous amount of damage

509
00:20:18.275 --> 00:20:20.515
to this planet environmentally.

510
00:20:20.515 --> 00:20:21.475
That's a fact.

511
00:20:21.475 --> 00:20:24.155
So in terms of what we've done to the oceans,

512
00:20:24.155 --> 00:20:27.208
the cutting of trees, our forests,

513
00:20:27.208 --> 00:20:31.148
toxic elements that in my opinion

514
00:20:31.148 --> 00:20:33.728
is what Copenhagen should have been about.

515
00:20:33.728 --> 00:20:35.129
When it comes to the rising

516
00:20:35.129 --> 00:20:37.665
in the ebb and flow of temperatures on the planet,

517
00:20:37.665 --> 00:20:39.669
there's a strong case.

518
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:41.969
It could be made from, and we can talk more about this,

519
00:20:41.969 --> 00:20:43.470
from the ice cores of Antarctica,

520
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:47.831
we can see there's a cyclic warming and cooling

521
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:52.052
in the ebb and flow of temperatures on the planet

522
00:20:52.052 --> 00:20:56.102
that are driven by

523
00:20:56.102 --> 00:20:57.782
another cycle we haven't even spoken about yet,

524
00:20:57.782 --> 00:21:00.325
solar cycles and it's a very strong body of evidence

525
00:21:00.325 --> 00:21:01.676
that suggest that.

526
00:21:03.286 --> 00:21:05.306
So it appears in the past

527
00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:08.486
there've been very high levels of carbon dioxide

528
00:21:08.486 --> 00:21:10.606
higher than they are now

529
00:21:10.606 --> 00:21:12.886
and the temperatures didn't increase.

530
00:21:12.886 --> 00:21:16.066
So it maybe, and this is where the scientific community

531
00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:18.811
is struggling a little bit, that maybe

532
00:21:18.811 --> 00:21:20.451
that the C02 is important

533
00:21:20.451 --> 00:21:22.011
but it may not be what's causing

534
00:21:22.011 --> 00:21:23.891
the temperatures to increase.

535
00:21:23.891 --> 00:21:25.712
We're looking now

536
00:21:25.712 --> 00:21:30.312
at cyclic evidence of the effect of the sun

537
00:21:30.312 --> 00:21:31.892
upon our planet,

538
00:21:31.892 --> 00:21:35.253
the solar influence called solar radiance upon the planet.

539
00:21:35.253 --> 00:21:39.973
We can go back through 60-80,000 years

540
00:21:39.973 --> 00:21:41.933
through the ice cores in Antarctica

541
00:21:41.933 --> 00:21:46.933
and find correlations in the layers of the ice that tells

542
00:21:47.033 --> 00:21:49.915
how strong and how weak the influence from the sun is.

543
00:21:49.915 --> 00:21:53.176
And it matches almost precisely these 5,000 year cycles.

544
00:21:53.176 --> 00:21:55.336
I mean, it's uncanny.

545
00:21:55.336 --> 00:21:57.438
And when the air and the temperatures warm,

546
00:21:57.438 --> 00:21:59.838
the sea levels rise because the ice melts

547
00:21:59.838 --> 00:22:01.798
and you can see that in the ice cores.

548
00:22:01.798 --> 00:22:03.738
And what's interesting

549
00:22:03.738 --> 00:22:05.998
is the warming generally is short lived

550
00:22:05.998 --> 00:22:09.698
and followed by a longer or more pronounced cooling cycle

551
00:22:09.698 --> 00:22:12.418
that causes more problems than the warming does.

552
00:22:12.418 --> 00:22:14.478
And there are number of scientists now that are saying,

553
00:22:14.478 --> 00:22:18.738
we very probably are moving into this cooling cycle

554
00:22:18.738 --> 00:22:20.218
but there's a time where both are happening

555
00:22:20.218 --> 00:22:21.558
at the same time.

556
00:22:21.558 --> 00:22:22.658
<v Voiceover>In this really,</v>

557
00:22:22.658 --> 00:22:24.039
you are saying is dependent upon

558
00:22:24.039 --> 00:22:26.219
a weakening of the magnetic field of the earth.

559
00:22:26.219 --> 00:22:29.517
<v ->The magnetic fields of the earth ebb and flow,</v>

560
00:22:29.517 --> 00:22:30.777
stronger and weaker

561
00:22:30.777 --> 00:22:33.157
when the magnetic fields are stronger,

562
00:22:33.157 --> 00:22:35.137
you can think of them like a blanket.

563
00:22:35.137 --> 00:22:37.917
It protects those beautiful planet we live on

564
00:22:37.917 --> 00:22:40.777
from incoming influence of

565
00:22:42.487 --> 00:22:44.177
ionized plasma and gas,

566
00:22:44.177 --> 00:22:47.037
the solar wind coming from the sun.

567
00:22:47.037 --> 00:22:49.237
So when the magnetic fields are high, we're protected.

568
00:22:49.237 --> 00:22:52.657
When the fields are low, there's less protection.

569
00:22:52.657 --> 00:22:54.595
While 2,000 years ago,

570
00:22:54.595 --> 00:22:55.493
and our scientists know this,

571
00:22:55.493 --> 00:22:58.133
2,000 years ago we reached the magnetic peak

572
00:22:58.133 --> 00:22:59.273
and we began to decline

573
00:22:59.273 --> 00:23:01.053
and we've been declining ever since.

574
00:23:01.053 --> 00:23:02.053
<v Voiceover>Well, that's when I first came in contact</v>

575
00:23:02.053 --> 00:23:03.076
with your work when you're talking about--

576
00:23:03.076 --> 00:23:04.913
<v ->1988, I was a geologist.</v>

577
00:23:04.913 --> 00:23:06.436
I was seeing this happening.

578
00:23:06.436 --> 00:23:08.336
As a geologist, I was looking at this and I said,

579
00:23:08.336 --> 00:23:09.356
"What does this means to us?"

580
00:23:09.356 --> 00:23:11.256
Everybody said, "Don't worry about it."

581
00:23:11.256 --> 00:23:12.337
So, that was '88.

582
00:23:12.337 --> 00:23:13.137
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

583
00:23:13.137 --> 00:23:15.737
<v ->So, what we know now is that</v>

584
00:23:15.737 --> 00:23:18.497
the magnetic fields did begin

585
00:23:18.497 --> 00:23:21.657
a dramatic decline 2,000 years ago,

586
00:23:21.657 --> 00:23:23.928
it hasn't turned back since.

587
00:23:26.018 --> 00:23:28.178
And then last 150 years,

588
00:23:28.178 --> 00:23:29.798
that decline has increased,

589
00:23:29.798 --> 00:23:33.498
we lost about 10% of the earth's magnetic field,

590
00:23:33.498 --> 00:23:36.240
another 10% the last 150 years.

591
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.460
So, the field is weaker now

592
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.860
than it was 2,000 years ago

593
00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.020
allowing more of a solar influence

594
00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.200
to affect the oceans in the atmosphere.

595
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.242
But the flip side, this is so interesting to me,

596
00:23:50.242 --> 00:23:54.522
is although it looks to us like the magnetic fields

597
00:23:54.522 --> 00:23:56.422
are really falling fast

598
00:23:56.422 --> 00:23:59.182
and they have in some respects,

599
00:23:59.182 --> 00:24:01.542
if we look at the nearer term,

600
00:24:01.542 --> 00:24:03.782
when step back and look at the big picture,

601
00:24:03.782 --> 00:24:06.822
what we find is that the drop in the magnetic fields

602
00:24:06.822 --> 00:24:08.963
that has occurred in the last 150 years,

603
00:24:08.963 --> 00:24:10.823
now has brought us into the range

604
00:24:10.823 --> 00:24:12.403
where we always are

605
00:24:12.403 --> 00:24:14.043
when we reach the point in the cycle

606
00:24:14.043 --> 00:24:17.103
where we are now, this 5,000 years cycle.

607
00:24:17.103 --> 00:24:18.423
And it's not so anomalous,

608
00:24:18.423 --> 00:24:21.463
it's just we don't see it happen so often.

609
00:24:21.463 --> 00:24:24.023
It doesn't mean that the magnetic fields

610
00:24:24.023 --> 00:24:25.763
aren't necessarily going to fall to zero.

611
00:24:25.763 --> 00:24:27.043
It doesn't mean that we're gonna go through

612
00:24:27.043 --> 00:24:28.123
a polar reversal.

613
00:24:28.123 --> 00:24:29.924
We have in the past but the evidence says

614
00:24:29.924 --> 00:24:33.004
it's not part of our 2012 scenario.

615
00:24:33.004 --> 00:24:34.984
So it's one last thing we have to worry about.

616
00:24:34.984 --> 00:24:38.224
But to me, it's important to see

617
00:24:38.224 --> 00:24:40.326
in the place and the context,

618
00:24:40.326 --> 00:24:42.327
the changes right now that we're seeing

619
00:24:42.327 --> 00:24:45.148
and where they fit within this 5,000 year cycle

620
00:24:45.148 --> 00:24:46.728
that our ancestors told us about,

621
00:24:46.728 --> 00:24:50.068
so, this is what the new book Fractal Time is all about.

622
00:24:50.068 --> 00:24:53.049
If we know where and how to look into the past,

623
00:24:53.049 --> 00:24:54.549
for dates,

624
00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:57.349
then we can take those dates like a cookie cutter

625
00:24:57.349 --> 00:25:00.669
and superimpose them on physical things

626
00:25:00.669 --> 00:25:03.751
so that we can check on those dates and see what happen.

627
00:25:03.751 --> 00:25:05.871
So we can go into the ice cores

628
00:25:05.871 --> 00:25:08.291
and we can see 5,000 years ago, one cycle,

629
00:25:08.291 --> 00:25:09.911
10,000 years ago, two cycles,

630
00:25:09.911 --> 00:25:14.011
26,000 years ago, the beginning of this cycle

631
00:25:14.011 --> 00:25:16.591
of the precession of the equinoxes.

632
00:25:16.591 --> 00:25:19.251
So we take those dates and then we have a template.

633
00:25:19.251 --> 00:25:22.252
What was the strength of the magnetic field of the earth

634
00:25:22.252 --> 00:25:23.252
at those points?

635
00:25:23.252 --> 00:25:24.893
Where the sea levels rising or falling at those points?

636
00:25:24.893 --> 00:25:27.713
Where the temperatures rising or falling at those points?

637
00:25:27.713 --> 00:25:30.694
Was the sun's energy, stronger or weaker at those points?

638
00:25:30.694 --> 00:25:32.535
And what we find is at those points,

639
00:25:32.535 --> 00:25:34.575
the magnetic fields are always weaker,

640
00:25:34.575 --> 00:25:36.935
it means the atmosphere of the earth is heated up,

641
00:25:36.935 --> 00:25:38.095
it means the oceans were heated up,

642
00:25:38.095 --> 00:25:40.095
it means the ice begins to melt.

643
00:25:40.095 --> 00:25:41.815
When the ice melts, the water has to go somewhere.

644
00:25:41.815 --> 00:25:44.435
The sea levels begin to increase.

645
00:25:44.435 --> 00:25:45.995
That changes climate

646
00:25:45.995 --> 00:25:48.135
and the climate begins to change

647
00:25:48.135 --> 00:25:50.795
the weather patterns in the local areas

648
00:25:50.795 --> 00:25:51.595
and all of the sudden,

649
00:25:51.595 --> 00:25:53.855
we're not growing corn in Nebraska in August anymore

650
00:25:53.855 --> 00:25:56.116
like we have for the last thousand years.

651
00:25:56.116 --> 00:25:57.596
<v Voiceover>Even the wine country in California</v>

652
00:25:57.596 --> 00:25:59.196
is moving towards Oregon, yeah.

653
00:25:59.196 --> 00:26:00.116
<v ->Exactly.</v>

654
00:26:00.116 --> 00:26:01.436
I live in Northern New Mexico,

655
00:26:01.436 --> 00:26:03.997
they're growing grapes in Northern New Mexico now.

656
00:26:03.997 --> 00:26:05.960
<v Voiceover>So it is evidence</v>

657
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.820
by what we're seeing through agriculture

658
00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.680
but there's something else about this magnetic thing

659
00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.840
we're talking about.

660
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:15.900
Science, you're saying, has now revealed or is now

661
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.641
can understand and articulate the fact that

662
00:26:19.641 --> 00:26:22.921
when you start looking at the galactic center of milky way,

663
00:26:22.921 --> 00:26:25.542
you have an increased magnetic field.

664
00:26:25.542 --> 00:26:27.762
You have a decreased field here on earth

665
00:26:27.762 --> 00:26:29.142
as all of this is happening

666
00:26:29.142 --> 00:26:32.242
as we're moving into a saturation.

667
00:26:32.242 --> 00:26:34.643
So explain how that all works together.

668
00:26:34.643 --> 00:26:37.104
<v ->This is the question, how far beyond our planet</v>

669
00:26:37.104 --> 00:26:40.184
do we want to look for the trigger

670
00:26:40.184 --> 00:26:42.464
of what's driving the effects?

671
00:26:42.464 --> 00:26:43.865
So the changes are happening on earth

672
00:26:43.865 --> 00:26:44.705
and we're aware of that

673
00:26:44.705 --> 00:26:48.207
and in our indigenous ancestors were telling about this.

674
00:26:48.207 --> 00:26:49.675
Where I think and I've shared this

675
00:26:49.675 --> 00:26:51.435
with audiences all over the world

676
00:26:51.435 --> 00:26:53.375
and some of them through translators

677
00:26:53.375 --> 00:26:54.715
and some in English.

678
00:26:54.715 --> 00:26:56.617
And I've seen their eyes and this is important,

679
00:26:56.617 --> 00:26:59.297
this is meaningful for people to understand

680
00:26:59.297 --> 00:27:01.178
that the changes are not confined to the earth,

681
00:27:01.178 --> 00:27:02.638
it isn't just the earth

682
00:27:02.638 --> 00:27:05.018
and the earth isn't changing because we did something wrong

683
00:27:05.018 --> 00:27:06.598
and the earth isn't broken.

684
00:27:06.598 --> 00:27:08.938
And I think it's really important for us to understand that.

685
00:27:08.938 --> 00:27:10.698
The changes are happening on every planet

686
00:27:10.698 --> 00:27:13.264
on our solar system is undergoing change right now.

687
00:27:13.264 --> 00:27:15.044
Mars is undergoing a climate change.

688
00:27:15.044 --> 00:27:16.644
It's global warming on Mars.

689
00:27:16.644 --> 00:27:18.324
The poles are melting.

690
00:27:18.324 --> 00:27:20.805
There have been magnetic reversals on Uranus and Neptune,

691
00:27:20.805 --> 00:27:23.865
there have been reversals there.

692
00:27:23.865 --> 00:27:25.425
The planets in our solar system are changing.

693
00:27:25.425 --> 00:27:27.505
Our sun is changing.

694
00:27:27.505 --> 00:27:30.605
And whatever it is that's driving these changes

695
00:27:30.605 --> 00:27:33.005
extends beyond and from somewhere

696
00:27:33.005 --> 00:27:35.065
other than our solar system.

697
00:27:35.065 --> 00:27:40.065
So within the last years of the last decade,

698
00:27:40.365 --> 00:27:42.845
the late 90's and early 2,000's,

699
00:27:42.845 --> 00:27:45.786
Peer reviewed scientific journals,

700
00:27:45.786 --> 00:27:49.186
made discoveries that too many of our listeners

701
00:27:49.186 --> 00:27:50.686
may not sound like a big deal

702
00:27:50.686 --> 00:27:52.986
but to the scientific world, they are a big deal.

703
00:27:52.986 --> 00:27:54.286
So the first discovery was that

704
00:27:54.286 --> 00:27:56.846
the center of our milky way galaxy

705
00:27:56.846 --> 00:28:00.406
is a powerful source of energy

706
00:28:00.406 --> 00:28:03.346
coming from something that we didn't know was there.

707
00:28:03.346 --> 00:28:04.727
Now, at the center of our milky way

708
00:28:04.727 --> 00:28:05.767
when I was in school,

709
00:28:05.767 --> 00:28:08.609
maybe when our listeners were in school, our viewers,

710
00:28:08.609 --> 00:28:10.271
we always thought there's a big black hole

711
00:28:10.271 --> 00:28:12.551
at the center of the milky way and there is.

712
00:28:12.551 --> 00:28:15.451
That's a powerful source of energy.

713
00:28:15.451 --> 00:28:17.631
But it's also clouded by a lot of dust,

714
00:28:17.631 --> 00:28:20.292
galactic dust you can't see what else is there.

715
00:28:20.292 --> 00:28:22.012
A hubble space telescope now is able to look

716
00:28:22.012 --> 00:28:25.372
through that dust and found the largest,

717
00:28:25.372 --> 00:28:28.972
most powerful star anywhere in the milky way

718
00:28:28.972 --> 00:28:30.972
is right there in the center and it's kinda parked

719
00:28:30.972 --> 00:28:32.612
next to this black hole.

720
00:28:32.612 --> 00:28:35.332
So the irony is you've got a black hole

721
00:28:35.332 --> 00:28:37.812
and a massive star together.

722
00:28:37.812 --> 00:28:39.792
And the implications of that or vast,

723
00:28:39.792 --> 00:28:43.172
but together, the combined effect

724
00:28:43.172 --> 00:28:45.793
creates what are called magnetic filaments

725
00:28:45.793 --> 00:28:47.033
and this is important.

726
00:28:47.033 --> 00:28:51.233
It's not like a solid filled, they're like tentacles

727
00:28:51.233 --> 00:28:53.393
of magnetic influence

728
00:28:53.393 --> 00:28:57.713
that affects our solar system and other solar systems

729
00:28:57.713 --> 00:28:59.773
depending on where we are in our orbit.

730
00:28:59.773 --> 00:29:02.474
So, okay, scientific discoveries that first

731
00:29:02.474 --> 00:29:04.396
there's a field of energy in the center of milky way

732
00:29:04.396 --> 00:29:07.219
that has powerful effects on earth,

733
00:29:07.219 --> 00:29:08.819
it ebbs and flows.

734
00:29:08.819 --> 00:29:11.060
The second discovery is that the ebb and flow

735
00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.880
occurred on a rhythmic basis,

736
00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:17.721
cyclic basis that our ancestors were able to calculate

737
00:29:17.721 --> 00:29:20.121
through the mathematics and the rhythms of nature,

738
00:29:20.121 --> 00:29:21.701
they understood.

739
00:29:21.701 --> 00:29:24.701
And it's all about earth’s position in the heavens,

740
00:29:24.701 --> 00:29:27.441
the tilt, the orbit, the wobble,

741
00:29:27.441 --> 00:29:29.821
where we are in the elliptical orbit

742
00:29:29.821 --> 00:29:32.341
around this center of the milky way,

743
00:29:32.341 --> 00:29:33.985
when we're at the far ends, we're further away,

744
00:29:33.985 --> 00:29:36.905
where on the

745
00:29:36.905 --> 00:29:39.701
sides of the ellipse, we're a little closer.

746
00:29:39.701 --> 00:29:42.101
And all of these things appeared to be

747
00:29:42.101 --> 00:29:44.682
what's driving this change in our planet.

748
00:29:44.682 --> 00:29:46.981
So when we put all of these together,

749
00:29:46.981 --> 00:29:49.141
for me, I think we're missing the point

750
00:29:49.141 --> 00:29:52.381
if we say we've gotta work together to stop

751
00:29:52.381 --> 00:29:53.901
climate change

752
00:29:53.901 --> 00:29:56.061
and we recognize that the climate changes

753
00:29:56.061 --> 00:29:58.301
on a cyclic basis.

754
00:29:58.301 --> 00:30:01.001
And my sense is, it's more important,

755
00:30:01.001 --> 00:30:03.461
I'm less concerned about the physical changes

756
00:30:03.461 --> 00:30:05.561
for the 2012 window of time.

757
00:30:05.561 --> 00:30:07.761
I wanna be really clear about this.

758
00:30:07.761 --> 00:30:10.521
Because 2012 is a date

759
00:30:10.521 --> 00:30:12.141
that the Mayan’s chose

760
00:30:12.141 --> 00:30:15.381
when the sun from here on earth would appear

761
00:30:15.381 --> 00:30:18.521
as if it were rising in the center of the dark rift

762
00:30:18.521 --> 00:30:19.758
of the milky way galaxy,

763
00:30:19.758 --> 00:30:22.352
a place they associate with birth and death.

764
00:30:22.352 --> 00:30:24.332
So that was a date.

765
00:30:24.332 --> 00:30:27.032
But to get to that alignment,

766
00:30:27.032 --> 00:30:29.974
we're talking about galaxies, and solar systems,

767
00:30:29.974 --> 00:30:34.974
and planets, huge systems that move slowly

768
00:30:35.174 --> 00:30:36.835
over long periods of time.

769
00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:38.755
So it's not like we go to bed

770
00:30:38.755 --> 00:30:41.017
on December 20th of 2012 on one world

771
00:30:41.017 --> 00:30:43.557
and we wake the next morning and everything has changed.

772
00:30:43.557 --> 00:30:44.837
But what is important,

773
00:30:44.837 --> 00:30:47.077
and this is important for my audiences as well.

774
00:30:47.077 --> 00:30:50.377
I found this to be very comforting to some people

775
00:30:50.377 --> 00:30:52.738
is to know that we're living with

776
00:30:52.738 --> 00:30:54.679
science now are calling a zone, a window,

777
00:30:54.679 --> 00:30:57.120
a 2012 window of change

778
00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.780
that actually began around 1980,

779
00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.640
ends around 2016.

780
00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.920
We're now in the year 2010 that means,

781
00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.320
we're over half way through.

782
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.260
It means we've already experienced

783
00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:11.380
many of the most profound frightening changes

784
00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.040
of the prophecies and the predictions.

785
00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.100
We're already seeing

786
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.521
forest fires raging out of control in multiple continents.

787
00:31:17.521 --> 00:31:19.421
We're already seeing millions of people die

788
00:31:19.421 --> 00:31:21.301
from disease that has no medical cure,

789
00:31:21.301 --> 00:31:22.601
in multiple continents.

790
00:31:22.601 --> 00:31:24.761
We're already seeing extremes and earthquakes,

791
00:31:24.761 --> 00:31:26.781
tsunamis wiping entire communities off

792
00:31:26.781 --> 00:31:28.461
the face of the earth.

793
00:31:28.461 --> 00:31:30.641
We're already seeing the worst of

794
00:31:30.641 --> 00:31:32.806
many of this prophecies, it's tough but

795
00:31:32.806 --> 00:31:34.188
I think we're doing all right.

796
00:31:34.188 --> 00:31:37.448
So to know rather than

797
00:31:37.448 --> 00:31:40.089
every day feeling like we're ticking down the clock

798
00:31:40.089 --> 00:31:42.969
getting closer and closer to this bad thing

799
00:31:42.969 --> 00:31:45.529
to recognize that we're already living

800
00:31:45.529 --> 00:31:47.469
many of those conditions.

801
00:31:47.469 --> 00:31:51.529
And the other key for the prophecies

802
00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:54.689
is that 2012 is the beginning,

803
00:31:54.689 --> 00:31:56.669
it's the end of the cycle

804
00:31:56.669 --> 00:31:59.549
5,125 year cycle

805
00:31:59.549 --> 00:32:02.449
by virtue that it's the birth of the next cycle.

806
00:32:02.449 --> 00:32:04.109
And what that means is that

807
00:32:04.109 --> 00:32:07.989
2012 is when we begin the world anew.

808
00:32:07.989 --> 00:32:09.389
It's not when the changes happen.

809
00:32:09.389 --> 00:32:12.629
And that means that whatever changes

810
00:32:12.629 --> 00:32:14.129
are required to get us to that point,

811
00:32:14.129 --> 00:32:17.150
they've already happened by the time we reach 2012.

812
00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:17.952
<v Voiceover>And we're ticking down now.</v>

813
00:32:17.952 --> 00:32:19.352
We've got a couple of years left on that one

814
00:32:19.352 --> 00:32:23.678
and you have this system

815
00:32:23.678 --> 00:32:25.700
of calculations--

816
00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:29.680
<v ->It's there system that I've made very accessible.</v>

817
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.960
<v Voiceover>Well, yes.</v>

818
00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:31.880
What is it?

819
00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.132
I mean, first of all, we're trying to figure out

820
00:32:33.132 --> 00:32:34.152
what do you call that?

821
00:32:34.152 --> 00:32:35.893
Because this is really important.

822
00:32:35.893 --> 00:32:37.189
Time code calculator.

823
00:32:37.189 --> 00:32:38.729
And let's talk about why that's important

824
00:32:38.729 --> 00:32:40.810
because of the years we're in right now.

825
00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:41.830
<v ->Yeah,</v>

826
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:44.550
what we know is that the changes that we're talking,

827
00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:46.190
first of all,

828
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:47.950
we know the changes are cyclic,

829
00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:50.072
we know that people had lived through them in the past

830
00:32:50.072 --> 00:32:51.712
so I just wanna to reiterate,

831
00:32:51.712 --> 00:32:54.562
I'm less concerned about the physical changes,

832
00:32:54.562 --> 00:32:56.724
my senses that we will

833
00:32:56.724 --> 00:32:58.564
and technologies, a lot of this.

834
00:32:58.564 --> 00:33:01.085
Not only we survive but I think we'll transcend

835
00:33:01.085 --> 00:33:02.709
the physical changes.

836
00:33:02.709 --> 00:33:05.050
From my perspective, the great danger now

837
00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:06.872
and we're not out of the woods on this one yet.

838
00:33:06.872 --> 00:33:09.612
It's how we respond personally,

839
00:33:09.612 --> 00:33:11.852
socially, culturally,

840
00:33:11.852 --> 00:33:14.532
and there's nations to the changes on the planet

841
00:33:14.532 --> 00:33:15.932
and the technology that we have

842
00:33:15.932 --> 00:33:17.812
allows us to wage war.

843
00:33:17.812 --> 00:33:20.602
And we can destroy

844
00:33:20.602 --> 00:33:24.174
an entire country in a matter of hours or days now.

845
00:33:24.174 --> 00:33:26.414
We'd never have that power before.

846
00:33:26.414 --> 00:33:29.834
And there's a lot of momentum moving toward

847
00:33:29.834 --> 00:33:31.414
a great war right now

848
00:33:31.414 --> 00:33:32.957
that I believe that we concur

849
00:33:32.957 --> 00:33:34.357
but I don't think it never has to happen.

850
00:33:34.357 --> 00:33:35.697
<v Voiceover>Let's go back and talk about that</v>

851
00:33:35.697 --> 00:33:37.037
via this technology.

852
00:33:37.037 --> 00:33:37.818
<v ->So all of those things,</v>

853
00:33:37.818 --> 00:33:39.618
I'm less concerned about the physical changes,

854
00:33:39.618 --> 00:33:42.463
I'd like to let people know the changes we're seeing now

855
00:33:42.463 --> 00:33:44.963
would always happen, our ancestors got through them,

856
00:33:44.963 --> 00:33:46.743
and we seem to do well if we work together.

857
00:33:46.743 --> 00:33:48.203
So here's the key.

858
00:33:48.203 --> 00:33:51.643
Our ancestors knew that these changes occur

859
00:33:51.643 --> 00:33:55.563
following natural rhythms and cycles

860
00:33:55.563 --> 00:33:57.303
that can be calculated easily

861
00:33:57.303 --> 00:33:59.083
following the simple mathematics

862
00:33:59.083 --> 00:34:01.143
that govern much of our universe.

863
00:34:01.143 --> 00:34:03.183
It doesn't have to be a lot of big,

864
00:34:03.183 --> 00:34:05.685
complex mathematic computations.

865
00:34:05.685 --> 00:34:07.225
We can do it that way

866
00:34:07.225 --> 00:34:10.506
but my sense says that nature

867
00:34:10.506 --> 00:34:12.326
is only as complex as we make it

868
00:34:12.326 --> 00:34:14.586
and it's actually a simple system.

869
00:34:14.586 --> 00:34:16.946
So knowing that,

870
00:34:16.946 --> 00:34:18.706
in the book Fractal Time,

871
00:34:18.706 --> 00:34:20.526
I gave our readers some simple math,

872
00:34:20.526 --> 00:34:22.407
but a lot of readers that don't like math

873
00:34:22.407 --> 00:34:24.207
so we automated this

874
00:34:24.207 --> 00:34:26.607
on the website and made something called

875
00:34:26.607 --> 00:34:29.009
a time code calculator that can be used

876
00:34:29.009 --> 00:34:30.729
in three different modalities.

877
00:34:30.729 --> 00:34:32.509
And one of those modalities

878
00:34:32.509 --> 00:34:36.989
allows us to choose a seed date from the past.

879
00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:40.031
The date that set in the motion a pattern of energy

880
00:34:40.031 --> 00:34:42.522
that will repeat on a rhythmic basis

881
00:34:44.272 --> 00:34:45.992
to enter to that date

882
00:34:45.992 --> 00:34:50.192
and know what fractal cycles will repeat

883
00:34:50.192 --> 00:34:51.192
and when they will repeat.

884
00:34:51.192 --> 00:34:52.523
So for example,

885
00:34:55.013 --> 00:34:56.913
the year 1941

886
00:34:56.913 --> 00:34:59.313
was the first year that United States of America,

887
00:34:59.313 --> 00:35:00.817
and that's history, was surprised and attacked

888
00:35:00.817 --> 00:35:04.158
on American soil by a foreign power.

889
00:35:04.158 --> 00:35:08.198
1941, that was a seed for surprise and attack

890
00:35:08.198 --> 00:35:09.419
on American soil.

891
00:35:09.419 --> 00:35:10.959
When I first developed this,

892
00:35:10.959 --> 00:35:14.220
the first test I did was I plugged that date in

893
00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.660
and ironically, one of the fractal cycles

894
00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:20.160
was exactly on 9/11, September 9/11.

895
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.150
<v Voiceover>You didn't back engineer it?</v>

896
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:23.602
You just stumbled on this,

897
00:35:23.602 --> 00:35:24.382
I mean it just--

898
00:35:24.382 --> 00:35:25.763
<v ->I didn't stumble, what I did was I put</v>

899
00:35:25.763 --> 00:35:26.763
the mask together and I said,

900
00:35:26.763 --> 00:35:28.643
If this were gonna work,

901
00:35:28.643 --> 00:35:32.983
I'd like to try it on something big,

902
00:35:32.983 --> 00:35:35.893
what's one of the most profound

903
00:35:38.468 --> 00:35:41.668
life changing moments in recent history

904
00:35:41.668 --> 00:35:44.528
and at this time when I put this together,

905
00:35:44.528 --> 00:35:46.428
it was September 2001.

906
00:35:46.428 --> 00:35:51.268
So, I plugged in 1941 seed date, there was,

907
00:35:51.268 --> 00:35:52.427
I don't have the numbers in front of me,

908
00:35:52.427 --> 00:35:54.807
the first fractal was in the 1970's

909
00:35:54.807 --> 00:35:57.546
that corresponded with the Yom Kippur War

910
00:35:57.546 --> 00:35:59.846
which could have resulted,

911
00:35:59.846 --> 00:36:01.506
it was a proxy war between United States

912
00:36:01.506 --> 00:36:03.686
and the Former Soviet Union.

913
00:36:03.686 --> 00:36:06.206
We transcended that and the date after that

914
00:36:06.206 --> 00:36:07.885
ended up being 9/11.

915
00:36:07.885 --> 00:36:09.745
it was right on that cycle.

916
00:36:09.745 --> 00:36:11.065
So this is an example.

917
00:36:11.065 --> 00:36:13.345
Now, when we see a date like that,

918
00:36:13.345 --> 00:36:15.324
it doesn't mean that the event must repeat.

919
00:36:15.324 --> 00:36:18.484
It means the conditions are right

920
00:36:18.484 --> 00:36:21.144
for that kind of thing to happen again

921
00:36:21.144 --> 00:36:23.684
and it's an indication, it's a tool

922
00:36:23.684 --> 00:36:25.824
that allows us to use a little more sensitivity

923
00:36:25.824 --> 00:36:27.704
and a little more diplomacy

924
00:36:27.704 --> 00:36:30.104
if we know that we're moving into one of those cycles.

925
00:36:30.104 --> 00:36:31.244
<v Voiceover>So the collective consciousness</v>

926
00:36:31.244 --> 00:36:36.084
must have been right to allow a 9/11 to have occured

927
00:36:36.084 --> 00:36:37.963
more or less.

928
00:36:37.963 --> 00:36:39.220
<v ->The conditions,</v>

929
00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.660
the global conditions

930
00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:42.097
where there's a whole conversation.

931
00:36:42.097 --> 00:36:44.535
We can have about why and what but,

932
00:36:44.535 --> 00:36:45.779
and I'm not saying that we necessarily

933
00:36:45.779 --> 00:36:47.596
could have prevented it

934
00:36:47.596 --> 00:36:51.559
but I think knowing that we are living

935
00:36:51.559 --> 00:36:53.679
a cycle where the conditions are right

936
00:36:53.679 --> 00:36:57.560
for some of the most frightening possibilities of our past.

937
00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.079
So for example,

938
00:36:59.079 --> 00:37:01.943
if our diplomats are in negotiations between

939
00:37:01.943 --> 00:37:04.083
the Israelis and the Iranians right now

940
00:37:04.083 --> 00:37:07.616
or the Palestinians and the Israelis in the Middle East

941
00:37:07.616 --> 00:37:09.606
and very delicate negotiations.

942
00:37:09.606 --> 00:37:12.147
And we happen to know that those negotiations

943
00:37:12.147 --> 00:37:15.327
are during a countdown to sanctions or war

944
00:37:15.327 --> 00:37:17.688
and we'd see that it's happening right on a time

945
00:37:17.688 --> 00:37:22.628
when a cycle makes the conditions right for that war.

946
00:37:22.628 --> 00:37:24.368
What it says to me

947
00:37:24.368 --> 00:37:28.708
is that's the time to be really, really sensitive,

948
00:37:28.708 --> 00:37:33.070
these very sensitive diplomacy, very clear communication

949
00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.730
maybe go a little further

950
00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:36.750
and go that extra mile now

951
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:38.751
where we wouldn't have through years ago

952
00:37:38.751 --> 00:37:39.951
or two years from now

953
00:37:39.951 --> 00:37:44.211
because the likelihood of this turning out bad

954
00:37:44.211 --> 00:37:46.851
is greater in the time of

955
00:37:46.851 --> 00:37:49.311
when these cycles converged.

956
00:37:49.311 --> 00:37:50.891
So that's an example.

957
00:37:50.891 --> 00:37:54.971
So knowing that, we took the time code calculator

958
00:37:54.971 --> 00:37:56.592
and looked at some of the

959
00:37:56.592 --> 00:37:58.812
defining events at the 20th century.

960
00:37:58.812 --> 00:38:00.152
And we can use any of them.

961
00:38:00.152 --> 00:38:01.232
I mean, you can use good things.

962
00:38:01.232 --> 00:38:04.452
You can use the end of the war,

963
00:38:04.452 --> 00:38:08.172
you can use your Superbowl,

964
00:38:08.172 --> 00:38:10.492
you know, when did your team win the Superbowl.

965
00:38:10.492 --> 00:38:12.232
But those generally don't cause problems.

966
00:38:12.232 --> 00:38:15.592
So we took some of the life defining

967
00:38:15.592 --> 00:38:17.852
events of the 20th century.

968
00:38:17.852 --> 00:38:21.252
The 1918 flu pandemic for example,

969
00:38:21.252 --> 00:38:24.992
1929 crash of the stock market.

970
00:38:24.992 --> 00:38:27.572
We looked at 1914, the seed date

971
00:38:27.572 --> 00:38:31.292
for global war in this world.

972
00:38:31.292 --> 00:38:33.112
And the interesting thing is

973
00:38:33.112 --> 00:38:37.192
when we look at the mall within this 5,125 year context,

974
00:38:37.192 --> 00:38:39.372
the repeat cycles,

975
00:38:39.372 --> 00:38:41.392
the fractal cycles for all of those,

976
00:38:41.392 --> 00:38:43.392
it's not about 2012,

977
00:38:43.392 --> 00:38:47.192
it's about what happens between, this is now 2010,

978
00:38:47.192 --> 00:38:50.612
between 2010 and 2012,

979
00:38:50.612 --> 00:38:54.152
many of the most frightening cycles are going to repeat.

980
00:38:54.152 --> 00:38:59.152
The conditions will be present between 2010 and 2011.

981
00:38:59.272 --> 00:39:00.533
<v Voiceover>For every one of those things</v>

982
00:39:00.533 --> 00:39:03.013
you talked about, for economic crash cycles,

983
00:39:03.013 --> 00:39:06.138
for potential global war cycles and--

984
00:39:06.138 --> 00:39:07.038
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

985
00:39:07.038 --> 00:39:09.318
They are between 2010 now where we are,

986
00:39:09.318 --> 00:39:11.738
this is January 2010

987
00:39:11.738 --> 00:39:15.218
and the mid 2011, next 12,18 months

988
00:39:15.218 --> 00:39:18.498
is the defining window of time

989
00:39:18.498 --> 00:39:23.419
that will determine how 2012 turns out.

990
00:39:23.419 --> 00:39:25.519
And none of the prophecies, none of the predictions

991
00:39:25.519 --> 00:39:27.859
could state specifically what happens

992
00:39:27.859 --> 00:39:31.019
because we are the unknown.

993
00:39:31.019 --> 00:39:33.999
We are the factor that could not be factored

994
00:39:33.999 --> 00:39:36.119
into the prediction and prophecies.

995
00:39:36.119 --> 00:39:39.999
Jeane Dixon, Edgar Cayce, Nostradamus,

996
00:39:39.999 --> 00:39:41.801
the Hopi prophecy

997
00:39:41.801 --> 00:39:43.682
is where they're showing two parallel paths,

998
00:39:43.682 --> 00:39:44.922
they're all about choice.

999
00:39:44.922 --> 00:39:46.702
What do we choose?

1000
00:39:46.702 --> 00:39:48.682
So know that we understand that there is a choice

1001
00:39:48.682 --> 00:39:50.082
and we're also beginning to understand

1002
00:39:50.082 --> 00:39:52.162
that the language of that choice

1003
00:39:52.162 --> 00:39:57.162
is based in heart centered lifestyles,

1004
00:39:58.082 --> 00:39:59.642
heart centered ways of living,

1005
00:39:59.642 --> 00:40:01.162
And we'll talk about that in just a minute

1006
00:40:01.162 --> 00:40:05.042
but the key is, when we look at so many frightening cycles

1007
00:40:05.042 --> 00:40:07.902
converging into such a narrow window of time,

1008
00:40:07.902 --> 00:40:12.106
it looks scary until we recognize the good news.

1009
00:40:12.106 --> 00:40:14.686
The good news is that the end of every cycle,

1010
00:40:14.686 --> 00:40:17.786
when it stops, there's a little window of opportunity

1011
00:40:17.786 --> 00:40:19.886
that physicists call a choice point

1012
00:40:19.886 --> 00:40:22.626
before the cycle begins again.

1013
00:40:22.626 --> 00:40:23.819
So just to be clear,

1014
00:40:23.819 --> 00:40:27.699
a cycle begins with a seed and event

1015
00:40:27.699 --> 00:40:29.753
that sets in the motion a pattern of energy

1016
00:40:29.753 --> 00:40:32.433
for war, for economic collapse

1017
00:40:32.433 --> 00:40:35.293
that will repeat on a rhythmic basis.

1018
00:40:35.293 --> 00:40:38.061
Then there's an opportunity at the end of the cycle,

1019
00:40:38.061 --> 00:40:40.861
it ends before the next cycle begins,

1020
00:40:40.861 --> 00:40:42.318
there's this little window of opportunity

1021
00:40:42.318 --> 00:40:43.278
called the choice point

1022
00:40:43.278 --> 00:40:44.598
or we can reset that pattern.

1023
00:40:44.598 --> 00:40:46.732
If we do nothing then the pattern begins

1024
00:40:46.732 --> 00:40:48.612
and perpetuates itself.

1025
00:40:48.612 --> 00:40:50.612
And we can make choices anytime.

1026
00:40:50.612 --> 00:40:54.489
But the physics suggest that it's in this choice point,

1027
00:40:54.489 --> 00:40:55.889
this window of opportunity,

1028
00:40:55.889 --> 00:40:58.666
when our choices have the greatest potency,

1029
00:40:58.666 --> 00:41:00.366
and if we're going to make a choice,

1030
00:41:00.366 --> 00:41:03.846
why not do it when the choice can have the greatest effect?

1031
00:41:03.846 --> 00:41:08.346
So individually and collectively, 2010, 2011

1032
00:41:08.346 --> 00:41:10.806
we are living a collective window of opportunity,

1033
00:41:10.806 --> 00:41:13.587
a global choice point to redefine one of the most

1034
00:41:13.587 --> 00:41:16.926
frightening patterns of our past and change forever

1035
00:41:16.926 --> 00:41:19.626
the patterns of war, the patterns of disease,

1036
00:41:19.626 --> 00:41:23.566
the patterns of economic disparity that lead

1037
00:41:23.566 --> 00:41:26.946
to 1929 collapse.

1038
00:41:26.946 --> 00:41:28.586
And because so many of those systems

1039
00:41:28.586 --> 00:41:29.926
are breaking down right now,

1040
00:41:29.926 --> 00:41:33.086
the choice is do we prop up a system

1041
00:41:33.086 --> 00:41:34.786
that's not sustainable to begin with

1042
00:41:34.786 --> 00:41:36.826
or do we let that system go

1043
00:41:36.826 --> 00:41:38.506
and put something into place now,

1044
00:41:38.506 --> 00:41:43.026
use this opportunity to build something new

1045
00:41:43.026 --> 00:41:47.326
that prevents us from ever living those disasters again.

1046
00:41:47.326 --> 00:41:48.543
But what was so powerful

1047
00:41:48.543 --> 00:41:50.343
and I assure this with our audience last night,

1048
00:41:50.343 --> 00:41:54.064
we're here in Sedona, Arizona in the Sedona Audience.

1049
00:41:54.064 --> 00:41:55.646
And the ancients talked to us about that,

1050
00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:57.146
there has to be a generation

1051
00:41:57.146 --> 00:42:00.566
that lives through both ways of being.

1052
00:42:00.566 --> 00:42:04.146
There's got to be a generation that has lived and mastered

1053
00:42:04.146 --> 00:42:07.637
all that has been

1054
00:42:08.927 --> 00:42:13.307
and recognizes the point where that begins

1055
00:42:13.307 --> 00:42:16.267
to fall away and is putting something new in place

1056
00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:19.827
but neither one of them are in completion

1057
00:42:19.827 --> 00:42:24.827
and it takes such a really strong being.

1058
00:42:26.728 --> 00:42:29.108
Strong in terms of internal strength,

1059
00:42:29.108 --> 00:42:32.448
emotional strength, spiritual strength

1060
00:42:32.448 --> 00:42:35.708
the strength of resiliency

1061
00:42:35.708 --> 00:42:40.668
and the ability to work with families and communities

1062
00:42:40.668 --> 00:42:42.968
in the presence of these great changes

1063
00:42:42.968 --> 00:42:45.966
to know that the world has gone to hell in a handbasket

1064
00:42:45.966 --> 00:42:47.945
as my mom says.

1065
00:42:47.945 --> 00:42:48.765
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1066
00:42:48.765 --> 00:42:50.085
<v ->That's her perspective.</v>

1067
00:42:50.085 --> 00:42:52.579
I mean and that is a perspective, a lot people say that.

1068
00:42:52.579 --> 00:42:54.620
But what is change

1069
00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:56.379
or the things that are no longer sustainable?

1070
00:42:56.379 --> 00:42:57.994
It appears that when we go through these,

1071
00:42:57.994 --> 00:43:00.133
and this is the beauty of the cycles,

1072
00:43:00.133 --> 00:43:01.453
all these systems are in place

1073
00:43:01.453 --> 00:43:03.810
so we're now living the result of 5,000 years

1074
00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:07.510
of learning how to do military campaigns,

1075
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:09.509
how to have global economic system,

1076
00:43:09.509 --> 00:43:12.390
how the heal and care for ourselves 5,000 years

1077
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:13.990
of experience who got behind this.

1078
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:16.909
Now, those systems are being stressed.

1079
00:43:16.909 --> 00:43:19.410
And what we find is under stress,

1080
00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:21.429
the ones that are sustainable

1081
00:43:21.429 --> 00:43:22.550
seemed to work pretty well

1082
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:23.190
and they hold up.

1083
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:25.670
The ones that don't are falling apart pretty quickly.

1084
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:28.130
Our choice is to recognize that,

1085
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:30.329
do we try to prop up the things

1086
00:43:30.329 --> 00:43:32.626
that are not sustainable in the long run

1087
00:43:32.626 --> 00:43:33.687
to make it easier for us

1088
00:43:33.687 --> 00:43:35.946
or do we just let them go now?

1089
00:43:35.946 --> 00:43:37.587
Because there are already new systems in place.

1090
00:43:37.587 --> 00:43:40.347
It's just a matter, there are green ways of living.

1091
00:43:40.347 --> 00:43:44.707
There are green sustainable ways of equitably

1092
00:43:44.707 --> 00:43:47.567
sustaining workers in large populations.

1093
00:43:47.567 --> 00:43:50.049
And it's a whole conversation we can have about that.

1094
00:43:50.049 --> 00:43:51.789
<v Voiceover>We've been doing a lot of interviews around</v>

1095
00:43:51.789 --> 00:43:54.929
alternative types of banking

1096
00:43:54.929 --> 00:43:57.129
and exchange of time and so forth

1097
00:43:57.129 --> 00:43:58.609
in preparation for the understanding

1098
00:43:58.609 --> 00:44:01.049
we can create something different.

1099
00:44:01.049 --> 00:44:01.860
It's happening, it's starting.

1100
00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:02.913
<v ->Yeah, it's happening now.</v>

1101
00:44:02.913 --> 00:44:03.994
So it's not like we got to stop now

1102
00:44:03.994 --> 00:44:05.034
and say, "Okay, what do we do?"

1103
00:44:05.034 --> 00:44:06.915
Because the choices were out there,

1104
00:44:06.915 --> 00:44:10.645
it's more about what do we choose, which of these systems?

1105
00:44:10.645 --> 00:44:11.997
Because there are people like you

1106
00:44:11.997 --> 00:44:14.738
and like your listeners who have been ahead of the curve.

1107
00:44:14.738 --> 00:44:16.398
They've already been thinking

1108
00:44:16.398 --> 00:44:18.038
for maybe 10, 15, 20 years

1109
00:44:18.038 --> 00:44:20.978
developing alternative ways of living,

1110
00:44:20.978 --> 00:44:24.241
alternative ways of doing business

1111
00:44:24.241 --> 00:44:28.582
and in finance, and of healing and negotiations

1112
00:44:28.582 --> 00:44:31.883
rather than war to solve our differences.

1113
00:44:31.883 --> 00:44:33.503
So of all those systems,

1114
00:44:33.503 --> 00:44:36.203
which ones do we choose to bring into place right now

1115
00:44:36.203 --> 00:44:38.604
and this is the window of opportunity, we're always--

1116
00:44:38.604 --> 00:44:39.625
<v Voiceover>And it's hard for people watching</v>

1117
00:44:39.625 --> 00:44:41.225
all these things happening at one time.

1118
00:44:41.225 --> 00:44:43.485
It's very easy to become emotionally overwhelmed,

1119
00:44:43.485 --> 00:44:45.605
mentally overwhelmed, and say,

1120
00:44:45.605 --> 00:44:47.527
"It just feels like it's already in motion,

1121
00:44:47.527 --> 00:44:50.447
"what can we do to stop such a huge thing?"

1122
00:44:50.447 --> 00:44:52.007
But that is not,

1123
00:44:52.007 --> 00:44:56.967
that doesn't serve anything, anybody least of all the self

1124
00:44:56.967 --> 00:44:58.387
because the reality is the self,

1125
00:44:58.387 --> 00:45:01.048
and now I'd like to get into the magnetism story again

1126
00:45:01.048 --> 00:45:02.748
but of the heart

1127
00:45:02.748 --> 00:45:05.648
and what was shown in the graphs you represent,

1128
00:45:05.648 --> 00:45:07.812
you showed last night regarding 9/11

1129
00:45:07.812 --> 00:45:09.672
and the power of the human heart

1130
00:45:09.672 --> 00:45:13.192
if we want to take this on individually and collectively.

1131
00:45:13.192 --> 00:45:14.592
<v ->Yeah, well the,</v>

1132
00:45:14.592 --> 00:45:15.852
you know, the bottom line.

1133
00:45:15.852 --> 00:45:18.535
I mean, mom and I have this conversation all the time.

1134
00:45:18.535 --> 00:45:22.688
To mom, the world feels like it changed quickly

1135
00:45:24.606 --> 00:45:25.818
and suddenly.

1136
00:45:25.818 --> 00:45:27.998
And so what mom says to me is,

1137
00:45:27.998 --> 00:45:29.901
she's always saying she wants to do together

1138
00:45:29.901 --> 00:45:30.901
when things settle down.

1139
00:45:30.901 --> 00:45:31.803
She goes, when things settle down,

1140
00:45:31.803 --> 00:45:33.103
when things get back to normal,

1141
00:45:33.103 --> 00:45:34.343
and I said, "What's normal?"

1142
00:45:34.343 --> 00:45:35.925
She says, "You know, like always 10 years ago."

1143
00:45:35.925 --> 00:45:39.945
And I said, "Mom, this is the new normal."

1144
00:45:39.945 --> 00:45:44.505
One of the most horrible experiences

1145
00:45:44.505 --> 00:45:48.702
that the United States had in 9/11 also

1146
00:45:48.702 --> 00:45:51.302
was the window of insight for scientist

1147
00:45:51.302 --> 00:45:53.982
to reveal one of the most profound truths

1148
00:45:53.982 --> 00:45:56.862
of our relationship to one another in the earth.

1149
00:45:56.862 --> 00:45:59.390
And quickly the bottom line is that

1150
00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:06.420
as a result of the 9/11, September 11, 2001,

1151
00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:10.420
everything that happened on that date,

1152
00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:13.700
we have two satellites in the Northern Hemisphere

1153
00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:16.899
that are called GOES, GOES geosynchronous satellites.

1154
00:46:16.899 --> 00:46:19.819
Every 30 minutes, they're sending back

1155
00:46:19.819 --> 00:46:21.040
a reading of the strength

1156
00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.401
for the magnetic fields of the earth.

1157
00:46:22.401 --> 00:46:25.821
The magnetic fields that sustain and connect all life,

1158
00:46:25.821 --> 00:46:28.961
the very magnetic fields that protect us

1159
00:46:28.961 --> 00:46:31.321
from influences, from beyond our world,

1160
00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:32.281
solar influences,

1161
00:46:32.281 --> 00:46:34.541
those fields we are intimately connected to.

1162
00:46:34.541 --> 00:46:36.361
<v Voiceover>Our brain, our bodies, everything.</v>

1163
00:46:36.361 --> 00:46:38.151
<v ->Everything, heart, brain, body or science</v>

1164
00:46:38.151 --> 00:46:42.702
has only recently begun to grasp

1165
00:46:42.702 --> 00:46:46.002
the depth of that connection and the implications.

1166
00:46:46.002 --> 00:46:47.462
So it was on that date

1167
00:46:47.462 --> 00:46:50.342
scientist were looking at these,

1168
00:46:50.342 --> 00:46:51.982
the satellite data.

1169
00:46:51.982 --> 00:46:54.603
And every day, every 24 hours there's an ebb and a flow,

1170
00:46:54.603 --> 00:46:57.044
the magnetic field ebb and flow within a certain range

1171
00:46:57.044 --> 00:46:58.086
and they're used to seeing that

1172
00:46:58.086 --> 00:47:00.806
and all of the sudden, they're watching a spike

1173
00:47:00.806 --> 00:47:02.787
for both their satellites and they're saying,

1174
00:47:02.787 --> 00:47:04.269
"What could that be from?"

1175
00:47:04.269 --> 00:47:07.329
And they overlaid it on to a map of dates

1176
00:47:07.329 --> 00:47:09.489
and it was at 9 AM, eastern standard time,

1177
00:47:09.489 --> 00:47:11.029
September 11, 2001.

1178
00:47:11.029 --> 00:47:16.029
9 AM, 15 minutes after the first plane hit the first tower.

1179
00:47:16.109 --> 00:47:19.009
It took about 15 minutes for the images to make it

1180
00:47:19.009 --> 00:47:21.569
around the world, to circulate through the media.

1181
00:47:21.569 --> 00:47:25.249
And what the scientists discovered was the

1182
00:47:25.249 --> 00:47:30.249
genuine untrained emotional response,

1183
00:47:30.289 --> 00:47:32.849
heart based response

1184
00:47:32.849 --> 00:47:36.049
of the global population

1185
00:47:36.049 --> 00:47:40.510
was so powerful when we have it collectively

1186
00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:43.813
that it actually influenced the very fields of the earth

1187
00:47:43.813 --> 00:47:45.835
that connect us and sustain all life.

1188
00:47:45.835 --> 00:47:48.495
Now some of that response was fear,

1189
00:47:48.495 --> 00:47:50.695
some of it was sadness,

1190
00:47:50.695 --> 00:47:51.755
some of it was shock,

1191
00:47:51.755 --> 00:47:53.776
some of it was compassion, some of it was anger.

1192
00:47:53.776 --> 00:47:55.876
So that's why we say it was untrained

1193
00:47:55.876 --> 00:47:59.136
but it was collectively occurring in the same moment

1194
00:47:59.136 --> 00:48:00.180
and time, these scientist said,

1195
00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:02.280
"Well, you know, humans have the ability

1196
00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:06.100
"to actually influence the very field

1197
00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:07.060
"that connects all life."

1198
00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.722
It gives a while new meaning to the Gaia

1199
00:48:08.722 --> 00:48:12.202
concept of us on a living body.

1200
00:48:12.202 --> 00:48:15.142
This led to a series of experiments to determine

1201
00:48:15.142 --> 00:48:19.562
what about human emotion was affecting those fields?

1202
00:48:19.562 --> 00:48:22.302
And what they found is that the human heart

1203
00:48:22.302 --> 00:48:24.002
creates the strongest electrical field

1204
00:48:24.002 --> 00:48:27.182
and the strongest magnetic field of any organ in the body

1205
00:48:27.182 --> 00:48:29.182
much more than previously thought.

1206
00:48:29.182 --> 00:48:33.142
So the human heart can be up to

1207
00:48:33.142 --> 00:48:34.262
a hundred times stronger

1208
00:48:34.262 --> 00:48:36.622
than the electrical field of the brain

1209
00:48:36.622 --> 00:48:40.142
but the human heart is about 5,000 times stronger

1210
00:48:40.142 --> 00:48:43.102
magnetically than the human brain

1211
00:48:43.102 --> 00:48:48.102
when we create a certain condition within us

1212
00:48:48.462 --> 00:48:52.662
that is induced by following the principles

1213
00:48:52.662 --> 00:48:55.323
of our most cherished spiritual and ancient traditions.

1214
00:48:55.323 --> 00:48:56.763
It isn't about religion,

1215
00:48:56.763 --> 00:48:59.263
it's about a heart centered experience

1216
00:48:59.263 --> 00:49:02.763
that can best be described in the western words

1217
00:49:02.763 --> 00:49:07.363
as care, appreciation, gratitude

1218
00:49:07.363 --> 00:49:09.363
and when we do that, what we do is we set up

1219
00:49:09.363 --> 00:49:12.143
a condition between our heart and our brain

1220
00:49:12.143 --> 00:49:13.303
that's called coherence.

1221
00:49:13.303 --> 00:49:15.843
The signal between the heart and the brain.

1222
00:49:15.843 --> 00:49:19.343
Communication when the feeling is optimum,

1223
00:49:19.343 --> 00:49:23.083
that signal can be measured about 0.10 cycles per second.

1224
00:49:23.083 --> 00:49:24.905
So you put one zero hertz

1225
00:49:24.905 --> 00:49:27.168
in that quality of the signal is what

1226
00:49:27.168 --> 00:49:31.208
attunes us to this field that connects everything

1227
00:49:31.208 --> 00:49:34.328
by following some of our most ancient

1228
00:49:34.328 --> 00:49:35.848
and cherished spiritual traditions

1229
00:49:35.848 --> 00:49:38.849
without the religious, the rules and the dogma,

1230
00:49:38.849 --> 00:49:40.989
this is about our connectedness

1231
00:49:40.989 --> 00:49:42.909
to the earth and to one another.

1232
00:49:42.909 --> 00:49:45.169
All the other stuff came along later.

1233
00:49:45.169 --> 00:49:46.989
By honoring that connection,

1234
00:49:46.989 --> 00:49:49.129
we literally have the ability to influence this field.

1235
00:49:49.129 --> 00:49:51.249
Well, here's why that's important.

1236
00:49:51.249 --> 00:49:53.729
In the process of coherence, we think better,

1237
00:49:53.729 --> 00:49:56.669
we solve problems better as individuals,

1238
00:49:56.669 --> 00:49:59.369
we're more cooperative, we're less aggressive.

1239
00:49:59.369 --> 00:50:02.169
We have greater cognitive abilities as the term that's used.

1240
00:50:02.169 --> 00:50:04.169
Our immune systems are strengthened.

1241
00:50:04.169 --> 00:50:07.149
And when a number of humans get together

1242
00:50:07.149 --> 00:50:09.049
and create that coherence,

1243
00:50:09.049 --> 00:50:11.769
it extends beyond their immediate bodies, into the filed

1244
00:50:11.769 --> 00:50:13.469
and others benefit from it

1245
00:50:13.469 --> 00:50:16.609
even though they are not actively participating in it.

1246
00:50:16.609 --> 00:50:18.189
This suggest,

1247
00:50:18.189 --> 00:50:20.509
and again, goes back to those traditions

1248
00:50:20.509 --> 00:50:22.269
that in times of great need,

1249
00:50:22.269 --> 00:50:24.829
and when the planet is going through

1250
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:27.129
rapid change in times of peril

1251
00:50:27.129 --> 00:50:30.209
to the degree that we can collectively come together

1252
00:50:30.209 --> 00:50:33.489
and create this coherence in our lives

1253
00:50:33.489 --> 00:50:36.909
that we can share that coherence

1254
00:50:36.909 --> 00:50:39.669
with those who simply don't have the time

1255
00:50:39.669 --> 00:50:42.929
and the opportunity to do something like that.

1256
00:50:42.929 --> 00:50:44.789
People in the Haiti, I think probably the last thing

1257
00:50:44.789 --> 00:50:46.069
they're doing right now

1258
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:48.969
is sitting down collectively creating coherence

1259
00:50:48.969 --> 00:50:51.569
because they're trying to get through the end of the day

1260
00:50:51.569 --> 00:50:55.269
but our coherence is certainly benefiting them

1261
00:50:55.269 --> 00:50:58.009
and the workers that are trying to help them right now

1262
00:50:58.009 --> 00:50:59.069
and that's just one example.

1263
00:50:59.069 --> 00:51:02.689
But if the leaders of our nations are on defense

1264
00:51:02.689 --> 00:51:04.489
as to whether or not to solve a problem

1265
00:51:04.489 --> 00:51:07.029
through war negotiation,

1266
00:51:07.029 --> 00:51:11.249
the data suggests and it's not definitive

1267
00:51:11.249 --> 00:51:14.409
that this is where it looks like this data is going

1268
00:51:14.409 --> 00:51:16.069
from some of the studies

1269
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:20.029
that creating a field of collective coherence

1270
00:51:20.029 --> 00:51:23.049
puts this fields into motion that tends

1271
00:51:23.049 --> 00:51:27.061
to tip the scales toward cooperation

1272
00:51:28.389 --> 00:51:31.631
and balance and peace

1273
00:51:31.631 --> 00:51:34.531
rather than aggression and competition and war.

1274
00:51:34.531 --> 00:51:37.421
And I cannot think of a better

1275
00:51:40.451 --> 00:51:42.511
awareness for us to come into

1276
00:51:42.511 --> 00:51:45.651
at the time of this great change

1277
00:51:45.651 --> 00:51:49.471
than to know that we are literally so deeply connected

1278
00:51:49.471 --> 00:51:51.911
with one another in the fields of the earth.

1279
00:51:51.911 --> 00:51:53.612
That when we work together, again,

1280
00:51:53.612 --> 00:51:56.072
this is the key, we have to work together to do this.

1281
00:51:56.072 --> 00:51:59.612
That the need for us to transcend the challenges

1282
00:51:59.612 --> 00:52:03.952
will drive our choice to cooperate at least initially

1283
00:52:03.952 --> 00:52:06.292
through heart-based experience.

1284
00:52:06.292 --> 00:52:09.652
My sense is that we will do that

1285
00:52:09.652 --> 00:52:11.992
because we needed to get through the changes

1286
00:52:11.992 --> 00:52:14.272
in this 2012 window.

1287
00:52:14.272 --> 00:52:16.292
For now on the short term

1288
00:52:16.292 --> 00:52:19.272
and after the 2012 window is passed,

1289
00:52:19.272 --> 00:52:21.632
I think we're gonna find that we like working together,

1290
00:52:21.632 --> 00:52:24.092
for better people, we have a better world,

1291
00:52:24.092 --> 00:52:25.452
where everybody is still,

1292
00:52:25.452 --> 00:52:26.672
we’ve got individual nations.

1293
00:52:26.672 --> 00:52:28.492
Everybody's got their culture and their dance

1294
00:52:28.492 --> 00:52:31.092
and their music but we learn to work together

1295
00:52:31.092 --> 00:52:33.752
for big things that benefit all of us.

1296
00:52:33.752 --> 00:52:37.792
And if that in fact is triggered

1297
00:52:37.792 --> 00:52:42.232
by the need to do so now because the changes are driving it.

1298
00:52:42.232 --> 00:52:44.212
Then when 2012 is no longer here,

1299
00:52:44.212 --> 00:52:45.352
I think we'll continue doing that

1300
00:52:45.352 --> 00:52:47.192
and the ancients and the prophecies have always said,

1301
00:52:47.192 --> 00:52:49.232
at the end of this window,

1302
00:52:49.232 --> 00:52:51.572
well, you will have a great war

1303
00:52:51.572 --> 00:52:52.872
and we lose all that we cherished

1304
00:52:52.872 --> 00:52:56.332
or we'll open the door to a thousand years of peace

1305
00:52:56.332 --> 00:52:59.112
and a new Golden Age which is what was here

1306
00:52:59.112 --> 00:53:01.472
preceding the last cycle, the great Golden Age

1307
00:53:01.472 --> 00:53:03.332
that so many have talked about.

1308
00:53:03.332 --> 00:53:05.132
And I think that's where we're going.

1309
00:53:05.132 --> 00:53:09.757
I think we've chosen or secure this route to get there.

1310
00:53:09.757 --> 00:53:12.157
And I can't say I understand

1311
00:53:12.157 --> 00:53:17.157
why we seem to need to experience what we don't want

1312
00:53:17.257 --> 00:53:19.477
before we know we don't want it

1313
00:53:19.477 --> 00:53:22.397
and then move a new direction rather

1314
00:53:22.397 --> 00:53:24.237
than setting our sights on a goal and saying,

1315
00:53:24.237 --> 00:53:26.118
"This is what we choose, let's live this way."

1316
00:53:26.118 --> 00:53:27.478
I don't know why it doesn't work that way.

1317
00:53:27.478 --> 00:53:30.038
<v Voiceover>It seems that the human being at this stage</v>

1318
00:53:30.038 --> 00:53:33.558
in our development seems to learn quickest through pain.

1319
00:53:33.558 --> 00:53:35.758
<v ->Well, we do that in our personal relationships.</v>

1320
00:53:35.758 --> 00:53:36.678
<v Voiceover>We do it in everything.</v>

1321
00:53:36.678 --> 00:53:39.298
<v ->Through our marriages, our divorces, our careers,</v>

1322
00:53:39.298 --> 00:53:40.798
we've done it as a world.

1323
00:53:40.798 --> 00:53:42.498
We have to experience global holocaust

1324
00:53:42.498 --> 00:53:44.018
before we said, " We know we don't want that."

1325
00:53:44.018 --> 00:53:45.878
"Global war, we don't want that."

1326
00:53:45.878 --> 00:53:47.918
"Global disease, we don't want that."

1327
00:53:47.918 --> 00:53:49.478
So, this is the opportunity,

1328
00:53:49.478 --> 00:53:51.588
so I'm encouraged.

1329
00:53:53.018 --> 00:53:54.920
My sense is we're not out of the woods yet

1330
00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:57.780
but we are close to the edge of the woods

1331
00:53:57.780 --> 00:53:59.400
because now we recognize

1332
00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:02.780
that the changes are part of a natural rhythmic cycle.

1333
00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:04.040
We know how to look.

1334
00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:06.660
We know that the changes are not anomalous.

1335
00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:09.360
We're living what we always live when we go through

1336
00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.040
this time, in the cycle.

1337
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.780
It just hasn't happened for 5,000 years

1338
00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:14.640
with almost seven billion people on the planet.

1339
00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.420
To the best of our knowledge,

1340
00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:20.120
we know that we have the ability to work together

1341
00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:23.380
collectively through heart centered ways of living.

1342
00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:25.141
We have a whole conversation about that.

1343
00:54:25.141 --> 00:54:30.102
To tip the scales of change and choice in our favor

1344
00:54:30.102 --> 00:54:34.462
as the systems that sustain us,

1345
00:54:34.462 --> 00:54:37.622
or not sustaining us, as they break down and fall away,

1346
00:54:37.622 --> 00:54:39.942
we know that we can work together and do those things.

1347
00:54:39.942 --> 00:54:42.702
For me, that is the message of our ancestors

1348
00:54:42.702 --> 00:54:45.722
and they said, "If you can know yourself in this time,

1349
00:54:45.722 --> 00:54:49.982
"then you'll be just fine in 2012 and beyond."

1350
00:54:49.982 --> 00:54:53.163
So 2012, from my perspective is not the end of the world,

1351
00:54:53.163 --> 00:54:55.343
it's the end of a world age.

1352
00:54:55.343 --> 00:54:56.883
And by definition, the end of anything

1353
00:54:56.883 --> 00:54:58.403
is beginning of what comes next.

1354
00:54:58.403 --> 00:55:01.403
And I am honored to be here with all of you

1355
00:55:01.403 --> 00:55:05.867
to bring in a new world age, a sixth world age.

1356
00:55:05.867 --> 00:55:08.507
The last humans to see what we're seeing right now

1357
00:55:08.507 --> 00:55:12.227
walked this earth 1,700 years before the biblical Exodus

1358
00:55:12.227 --> 00:55:14.427
from Egypt just for perspective.

1359
00:55:14.427 --> 00:55:16.048
So I don't know if we'll be around to see the next

1360
00:55:16.048 --> 00:55:17.689
one or not but we're here right now.

1361
00:55:17.689 --> 00:55:18.689
<v Voiceover>Well, there's argument</v>

1362
00:55:18.689 --> 00:55:19.989
that we may have been their last time,

1363
00:55:19.989 --> 00:55:21.990
and maybe there's next time too.

1364
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:25.250
And, Gregg, I know that you're in support

1365
00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:27.590
of the global coherence project and initiative

1366
00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:29.530
and I'll go ahead and talk about that in a little bit

1367
00:55:29.530 --> 00:55:30.691
'cause I know we're about out of time,

1368
00:55:30.691 --> 00:55:32.591
I've got to get you back to your hotel.

1369
00:55:32.591 --> 00:55:34.511
But I will go ahead and let people know about it

1370
00:55:34.511 --> 00:55:35.831
because I think a lot of times,

1371
00:55:35.831 --> 00:55:37.171
someone's listening, thinking,

1372
00:55:37.171 --> 00:55:38.251
yeah, we can all work together,

1373
00:55:38.251 --> 00:55:40.031
I don't personally know a single person

1374
00:55:40.031 --> 00:55:42.411
that goes along with this type of thinking

1375
00:55:42.411 --> 00:55:44.811
in my everyday life, that doesn't matter.

1376
00:55:44.811 --> 00:55:47.071
That doesn’t have to stop us from being part of something.

1377
00:55:47.071 --> 00:55:47.792
<v ->Can I say something about them?</v>

1378
00:55:47.792 --> 00:55:48.612
<v Voiceover>Please.</v>

1379
00:55:48.612 --> 00:55:52.332
<v ->For transparency, I am on the steering committee</v>

1380
00:55:52.332 --> 00:55:55.312
and the advisory board for the first of its kind,

1381
00:55:55.312 --> 00:55:58.655
science based initiative

1382
00:55:58.655 --> 00:56:01.895
making use of the discoveries that we just shared

1383
00:56:01.895 --> 00:56:05.975
of the fact that heart based experience

1384
00:56:05.975 --> 00:56:09.475
triggers positive changes in this global magnetic filed,

1385
00:56:09.475 --> 00:56:10.575
it's called,

1386
00:56:10.575 --> 00:56:12.895
we know that coherence is good for us individually,

1387
00:56:12.895 --> 00:56:14.875
so global coherence would be a good thing.

1388
00:56:14.875 --> 00:56:17.955
It's called the global coherence initiative, GCI.

1389
00:56:17.955 --> 00:56:21.535
What sets it apart from any other project of its kind

1390
00:56:21.535 --> 00:56:23.356
is it's privately funded,

1391
00:56:23.356 --> 00:56:25.656
this isn't a government initiative.

1392
00:56:25.656 --> 00:56:28.936
And privately, the technology is being

1393
00:56:28.936 --> 00:56:31.956
developed and deployed all over the earth

1394
00:56:31.956 --> 00:56:34.316
to measure the fields that we're talking about

1395
00:56:34.316 --> 00:56:37.176
so it's not a byproduct from a weather satellite

1396
00:56:37.176 --> 00:56:39.076
or from a communication satellite,

1397
00:56:39.076 --> 00:56:41.416
these devices are built only to measure these fields

1398
00:56:41.416 --> 00:56:43.756
and the military and the government are interested in this

1399
00:56:43.756 --> 00:56:45.476
because this has never been done before.

1400
00:56:45.476 --> 00:56:48.476
We're learning a lot of things that we never knew

1401
00:56:48.476 --> 00:56:51.936
about how complex our heart based relationship

1402
00:56:51.936 --> 00:56:55.116
to one another and the earth really is through this project.

1403
00:56:55.116 --> 00:56:55.796
<v Voiceover>This is fabulous.</v>

1404
00:56:55.796 --> 00:56:57.456
<v ->So the first layer is that the sensors</v>

1405
00:56:57.456 --> 00:56:59.116
are being built and deployed,

1406
00:56:59.116 --> 00:57:00.776
some of them are out them right now.

1407
00:57:00.776 --> 00:57:02.856
So we can tell everyday what the magnetic fields

1408
00:57:02.856 --> 00:57:05.376
of the earth are doing and how they're responding.

1409
00:57:05.376 --> 00:57:07.356
Phase one, phase two

1410
00:57:07.356 --> 00:57:10.316
coherence is something that can be taught and learned

1411
00:57:10.316 --> 00:57:11.936
relatively quickly and easily

1412
00:57:11.936 --> 00:57:13.516
and people are interested in doing that

1413
00:57:13.516 --> 00:57:17.036
through the Institute of HeartMath

1414
00:57:17.036 --> 00:57:18.016
and their website.

1415
00:57:18.016 --> 00:57:19.056
Now, I think you're doing some interviews

1416
00:57:19.056 --> 00:57:22.397
with people who are involved with that.

1417
00:57:22.397 --> 00:57:25.396
So I encourage our listeners, if you

1418
00:57:25.396 --> 00:57:28.417
rather than simply saying, this is what's happening.

1419
00:57:28.417 --> 00:57:30.957
For me it's important to share something actionable,

1420
00:57:30.957 --> 00:57:32.197
what can we do?

1421
00:57:32.197 --> 00:57:33.897
How can we work together as a family

1422
00:57:33.897 --> 00:57:36.437
to create a heart based initiative?

1423
00:57:36.437 --> 00:57:39.257
It tips the scales of change and balance in our favor,

1424
00:57:39.257 --> 00:57:41.518
in this window of opportunity, in GCI

1425
00:57:41.518 --> 00:57:43.478
to the best of my knowledge is the only

1426
00:57:43.478 --> 00:57:44.698
science based initiative.

1427
00:57:44.698 --> 00:57:46.522
The first of its kind ever been done to do that,

1428
00:57:46.522 --> 00:57:48.362
and I'm passionate about it.

1429
00:57:48.362 --> 00:57:50.042
I think it's a worthwhile to look into

1430
00:57:50.042 --> 00:57:51.262
and I want to thank you for the opportunity

1431
00:57:51.262 --> 00:57:52.202
to talk about this.

1432
00:57:52.202 --> 00:57:54.082
<v Voiceover>Yes, and also I'd like to follow up with you,</v>

1433
00:57:54.082 --> 00:57:56.802
maybe in a year or so once it has a chance to

1434
00:57:56.802 --> 00:57:58.443
bring in some more data.

1435
00:57:58.443 --> 00:57:59.523
<v ->In this room in a year.</v>

1436
00:57:59.523 --> 00:58:00.503
<v Voiceover>And this year,</v>

1437
00:58:00.503 --> 00:58:01.623
yes, in this room and when you’re--

1438
00:58:01.623 --> 00:58:03.203
I'd like to that and see

1439
00:58:03.203 --> 00:58:04.703
'cause I know we could have talk another hour

1440
00:58:04.703 --> 00:58:05.883
just about that.

1441
00:58:05.883 --> 00:58:07.923
But meanwhile, you've given people a place to go,

1442
00:58:07.923 --> 00:58:10.323
HeartMath, fabulous program people can really see

1443
00:58:10.323 --> 00:58:12.103
their own resonant, their own coherence

1444
00:58:12.103 --> 00:58:14.123
coming into order.

1445
00:58:14.123 --> 00:58:16.263
And I thank you so much for taking the time.

1446
00:58:16.263 --> 00:58:18.543
You're a much in demand man these days.

1447
00:58:18.543 --> 00:58:20.123
<v ->Well, thank you for being such a gracious host</v>

1448
00:58:20.123 --> 00:58:21.763
and for your patience with our schedules

1449
00:58:21.763 --> 00:58:24.463
and I look forward to that interview a year from now, okay?

1450
00:58:24.463 --> 00:58:25.583
Thank you for the work you do.

1451
00:58:25.583 --> 00:58:26.673
<v Voiceover>Thank you.</v>

1452
00:58:27.723 --> 00:58:29.043
For a much more expanded look

1453
00:58:29.043 --> 00:58:30.943
into the fractal time we spoke off

1454
00:58:30.943 --> 00:58:33.383
and all of the other subjects brought up in this interview,

1455
00:58:33.383 --> 00:58:36.463
you can visit's Gregg's website at www.greggbraden.com

1456
00:58:36.463 --> 00:58:38.583
and that's Gregg with two G's.

1457
00:58:38.583 --> 00:58:41.103
You can also pick up a copy of one of his many books

1458
00:58:41.103 --> 00:58:42.563
through all major book sellers.

1459
00:58:42.563 --> 00:58:43.563
Until next time.

1461
