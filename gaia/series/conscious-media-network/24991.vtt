00:00:00.127 --> 00:00:02.954
<v ->Ancient text told our ancestors that the sun</v>

2
00:00:02.954 --> 00:00:05.045
had a companion in the heavens,

3
00:00:05.045 --> 00:00:07.946
and that we were somehow bound to this other star.

4
00:00:07.946 --> 00:00:11.515
Walter Cruttenden, a science devotee since childhood,

5
00:00:11.515 --> 00:00:13.844
is coming to the same conclusions.

6
00:00:13.844 --> 00:00:16.052
The pull towards this knowledge was so strong, in fact,

7
00:00:16.052 --> 00:00:17.620
that he sold his businesses and has

8
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.105
devoted himself completely to learning the truth

9
00:00:20.105 --> 00:00:22.889
of whether or not our star has a companion

10
00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:26.728
it's gravitationally bound to in an amazing celestial dance

11
00:00:26.728 --> 00:00:30.139
that is shaking the world of astrophysics upside-down.

12
00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:35.132 line:15% 
(instrumental music)

13
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.057
Well, you're about to turn the world of astrophysics

14
00:00:42.057 --> 00:00:44.591
upside-down, it appears.

15
00:00:44.591 --> 00:00:46.680
We're going to get into how this journey

16
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.042
began for you, first, and start leading up to

17
00:00:50.042 --> 00:00:52.136
how you made this incredible,

18
00:00:52.136 --> 00:00:53.960
how you put these pieces together

19
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.555
using both ancient myth and cosmology

20
00:00:57.555 --> 00:00:59.389
and history to create a portrait

21
00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:02.130
of something truly astounding right now.

22
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.487
So, let's begin with you as a kid,

23
00:01:04.487 --> 00:01:06.866
'cause this didn't come out of nowhere.

24
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.903
You obviously had a passion and an excitement

25
00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:12.860
and an enthusiasm for science as a child

26
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.921
and for, as I understand it, the ancient mysteries.

27
00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:18.138
Can you talk a little bit about that?

28
00:01:18.138 --> 00:01:19.404
<v ->Yes.</v>

29
00:01:19.404 --> 00:01:21.743
You know, I thought I was like any boy that's

30
00:01:21.743 --> 00:01:25.873
interested in lost civilizations

31
00:01:25.873 --> 00:01:29.643
and treasure and cities

32
00:01:29.643 --> 00:01:32.064
that have, that you you just hear about

33
00:01:32.064 --> 00:01:35.700
in myth and folklore, and so I just

34
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.227
read all these books I could get on the subject,

35
00:01:38.227 --> 00:01:41.945
and my mom was more than helpful on that.

36
00:01:41.945 --> 00:01:46.192
And I learned a lot about history and realized

37
00:01:46.192 --> 00:01:50.415
that there were a lot of civilizations, such as Mesopotamia,

38
00:01:50.415 --> 00:01:54.510
where you had very high states of civilization

39
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.881
back 4,000 or 5,000 years ago.

40
00:01:57.783 --> 00:01:59.863
Almost at the beginning of when

41
00:01:59.863 --> 00:02:01.557
civilization supposedly began.

42
00:02:01.557 --> 00:02:02.355
<v Woman>When we were</v>

43
00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:03.944
supposed to be hunting and gathering, still.

44
00:02:03.944 --> 00:02:04.976
<v ->Exactly.</v>

45
00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:06.772
<v Woman>Yeah, so what's wrong with this picture?</v>

46
00:02:06.772 --> 00:02:07.922
What did you start finding?

47
00:02:07.922 --> 00:02:10.557
<v ->Well, then they declined.</v>

48
00:02:10.557 --> 00:02:12.156
Sumer declined to the Akkad.

49
00:02:12.156 --> 00:02:14.407
Akkad declined to Babylon.

50
00:02:14.407 --> 00:02:18.140
Babylon to Assyria, and then pretty much to dust.

51
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.063
And it's only really in the last probably

52
00:02:22.063 --> 00:02:26.993
10, 15 years, that we're realizing how great Sumer was.

53
00:02:28.588 --> 00:02:33.573
Cities with plumbing and sewage systems,

54
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.215
extensive trade around the world,

55
00:02:37.215 --> 00:02:39.935
trepanation devices to do brain surgery.

56
00:02:39.935 --> 00:02:44.671
They found these devices, they found holes in skulls

57
00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:47.316
that have completely healed, so the people lived.

58
00:02:47.316 --> 00:02:49.652
And, you know, it's different than

59
00:02:49.652 --> 00:02:54.196
what we were taught in school, and it goes on all over.

60
00:02:54.196 --> 00:02:56.681
In the Indus Valley it's the same way.

61
00:02:56.681 --> 00:03:00.018
Obviously, the Mediterranean Egypt decline.

62
00:03:00.018 --> 00:03:03.538
Greece was more refined than Rome,

63
00:03:03.538 --> 00:03:06.684
although Rome sort of has a bigger name.

64
00:03:06.684 --> 00:03:09.807
You know, Greece, at least they had democracy,

65
00:03:09.807 --> 00:03:13.444
and in Rome it was more brute force.

66
00:03:13.444 --> 00:03:14.862
You know, nail 'em up in the streets.

67
00:03:14.862 --> 00:03:16.569
And then finally even that goes away

68
00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.576
and you have this long dark age.

69
00:03:20.908 --> 00:03:23.404
And it just didn't make sense with

70
00:03:23.404 --> 00:03:25.697
what I was then taught in school,

71
00:03:25.697 --> 00:03:28.033
that things are pretty much linear.

72
00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:31.841
Caveman to modern man, and don't question that

73
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:35.030
because that was just bad choices or bad generals

74
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.419
or germs or something.

75
00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.008
<v Woman>And myth, it seems that</v>

76
00:03:39.008 --> 00:03:41.910
it's always relegated to myth, these great fantasies,

77
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.985
these tales of golden ages and so forth, but the truth is,

78
00:03:45.985 --> 00:03:48.416
they have uncovered some very significant findings

79
00:03:48.416 --> 00:03:51.445
technologically, and I don't know much about it,

80
00:03:51.445 --> 00:03:54.837
but one called the Babylonian Battery

81
00:03:54.837 --> 00:03:58.697
and another device that has gears.

82
00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:01.011
A very sophisticated mechanism

83
00:04:01.011 --> 00:04:03.123
from thousands of years ago.

84
00:04:03.123 --> 00:04:04.425
Do you care to comment on some of that,

85
00:04:04.425 --> 00:04:06.216
just to kind of establish where we've been?

86
00:04:06.216 --> 00:04:08.081
<v ->Yes, the Babylon Battery,</v>

87
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.748
unfortunately when they found it,

88
00:04:10.748 --> 00:04:14.932
they lost the information about exactly where they found it,

89
00:04:14.932 --> 00:04:16.861
so they're not sure if it's 2,000 years old

90
00:04:16.861 --> 00:04:19.805
or 4,000 years old, and that makes a big difference.

91
00:04:19.805 --> 00:04:22.386
Although, not too much of a difference to modern man,

92
00:04:22.386 --> 00:04:25.180
since Volta wasn't supposed to have

93
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.230
invented the battery until 1700,

94
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.174
so it's still a couple thousand years out of place.

95
00:04:31.174 --> 00:04:34.032
And the Antikythera device is the same way.

96
00:04:34.032 --> 00:04:38.988
This is a shipwreck they found

97
00:04:38.988 --> 00:04:43.307
off the Isle of Antikythera in the Eastern Mediterranean

98
00:04:43.307 --> 00:04:47.336
by sponge divers in 1901, I think it was.

99
00:04:47.336 --> 00:04:51.751
And it had amphora, and coins, and jewelry.

100
00:04:51.751 --> 00:04:55.283
So it was very reliably dated to about 80 BC.

101
00:04:55.283 --> 00:04:59.410
And in that conglomeration of corroded stuff all together

102
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.599
was this machine-looking device.

103
00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.593
So, they saved it and put it aside

104
00:05:04.593 --> 00:05:07.605
in the Greek museum in Athens.

105
00:05:08.817 --> 00:05:11.900
About 50 years later, somebody came along and dropped it

106
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.782
and it splayed open, and it revealed that there's

107
00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:17.915
quite a number of gears there.

108
00:05:17.915 --> 00:05:20.805
<v Woman>And finely tuned, tooled gears.</v>

109
00:05:20.805 --> 00:05:22.790
<v Walter>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Woman>Almost, yeah.</v>

110
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.594
<v Walter>Price rebuilt this thing as best he could</v>

111
00:05:26.594 --> 00:05:29.783
about 10, 20 years later, and he found out that

112
00:05:29.783 --> 00:05:34.005
there's 32 precision gears, and one of those

113
00:05:34.005 --> 00:05:36.949
is a large differential gear, so it's like a turntable

114
00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:38.784
that can move the other gears.

115
00:05:38.784 --> 00:05:42.923
This isn't a technology that was developed here

116
00:05:42.923 --> 00:05:46.889
until the Industrial Revolution, 1800s.

117
00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.873
So again, something is almost 2,000 years out of place,

118
00:05:49.873 --> 00:05:50.878
as a minimum.

119
00:05:50.878 --> 00:05:52.455
<v Woman>And this is true all over the planet,</v>

120
00:05:52.455 --> 00:05:55.953
In the case of, in Japan, in the Far East, as well.

121
00:05:55.953 --> 00:05:57.505
Can you give us a little bit of background of

122
00:05:57.505 --> 00:05:58.960
some of the findings there,

123
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.009
that really go back 12,000 years.

124
00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:02.651
10,000 to 12,000 years.

125
00:06:02.651 --> 00:06:04.624
<v ->Well, that's Graham's work.
<v Woman>Right.</v>

126
00:06:04.624 --> 00:06:06.458
<v Walter>He seem's to have found</v>

127
00:06:06.458 --> 00:06:08.666
structures under the sea.

128
00:06:08.666 --> 00:06:10.540
Yonaguni, and...

129
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.897
I've not been there myself,

130
00:06:12.897 --> 00:06:16.001
but I've spent a lot of time with him,

131
00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:18.048
looked at a lot of photos, talked to Santha

132
00:06:18.048 --> 00:06:21.931
who's also dove there, as did Shock and West.

133
00:06:21.931 --> 00:06:24.042
<v Woman>It's creating a larger portrait</v>

134
00:06:24.042 --> 00:06:26.944
with all of you now joining together

135
00:06:26.944 --> 00:06:30.602
in your pieces of the puzzle, which is really exciting.

136
00:06:30.602 --> 00:06:34.378
<v ->Yeah, we have this almost spontaneous collaboration</v>

137
00:06:34.378 --> 00:06:38.588
over the internet and now we're good friends,

138
00:06:38.588 --> 00:06:40.178
because we see the same things,

139
00:06:40.178 --> 00:06:44.242
that the modern view of history doesn't make sense,

140
00:06:44.242 --> 00:06:47.505
so we need to try to put the pieces together

141
00:06:47.505 --> 00:06:49.212
in a way that does make sense.

142
00:06:49.212 --> 00:06:51.388
<v Woman>So, where this ended up taking you</v>

143
00:06:51.388 --> 00:06:54.954
as you matured in your information and curiosity,

144
00:06:54.954 --> 00:06:57.976
was into understanding what creates

145
00:06:57.976 --> 00:07:02.754
these large shifts in consciousness,

146
00:07:02.754 --> 00:07:04.216
over epoch periods.

147
00:07:04.216 --> 00:07:06.658
I'm guessing that's where you ended up, right?

148
00:07:06.658 --> 00:07:10.637
<v ->Yes, and I didn't even put it in terms of consciousness</v>

149
00:07:10.637 --> 00:07:14.370
when I first saw the problem, I was just wondering

150
00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.524
why you had all these high civilizations

151
00:07:16.524 --> 00:07:19.895
all around the world, and they all declined into a dark age,

152
00:07:19.895 --> 00:07:22.092
and now we seem to be going up.

153
00:07:22.092 --> 00:07:26.516
And so, I read different view points on this.

154
00:07:26.516 --> 00:07:30.713
Sitchin, for example, says that there were aliens

155
00:07:30.713 --> 00:07:33.762
that seeded the earth, you know,

156
00:07:33.762 --> 00:07:36.217
5,000, 6,000 years ago,

157
00:07:36.217 --> 00:07:39.353
and that's why mankind, who was supposedly

158
00:07:39.353 --> 00:07:41.528
hunter-gatherer for millions of years,

159
00:07:41.528 --> 00:07:43.942
suddenly developed technology.

160
00:07:45.623 --> 00:07:48.993
But, if that's true, then why does it all

161
00:07:48.993 --> 00:07:52.577
gradually go back down again into a dark age?

162
00:07:52.577 --> 00:07:53.910
So that didn't make sense to me,

163
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.723
and others talked about a mother culture,

164
00:07:55.723 --> 00:07:59.179
such as Atlantis, which I wouldn't discount,

165
00:07:59.179 --> 00:08:02.614
that some great culture existed long ago.

166
00:08:02.614 --> 00:08:06.532
Although, you know, there's no specific proof for that one.

167
00:08:07.582 --> 00:08:10.984
But again, the same thing, why would mankind

168
00:08:10.984 --> 00:08:14.963
sort of lose the ability to make geared devices?

169
00:08:14.963 --> 00:08:17.755
To know that we're in a heliocentric system?

170
00:08:17.755 --> 00:08:19.347
To make Batteries?

171
00:08:19.347 --> 00:08:20.543
Et cetera, et cetera.

172
00:08:21.373 --> 00:08:24.957
And so, I just kept thinking about it and thinking about it

173
00:08:24.957 --> 00:08:28.614
and noticed that a lot of the myth and folklore

174
00:08:28.614 --> 00:08:32.251
referred to this cycle, the Great Year, it's called,

175
00:08:32.251 --> 00:08:35.173
with a golden age on one end and a dark age on the other,

176
00:08:35.173 --> 00:08:38.735
and said that it had something to do with precession.

177
00:08:38.735 --> 00:08:40.564
Precession of the equinox.

178
00:08:41.774 --> 00:08:44.593
That's a repeated point

179
00:08:44.593 --> 00:08:47.148
in so many of these myths...

180
00:08:48.636 --> 00:08:49.679
And so that's--

181
00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:52.261
<v Woman>Can you give us a little background of</v>

182
00:08:52.261 --> 00:08:56.123
where the original information

183
00:08:56.123 --> 00:08:58.095
to indicate that the ancients had understood

184
00:08:58.095 --> 00:08:59.928
this precession were buried?

185
00:08:59.928 --> 00:09:03.672
I mean, is it in Egyptology, is it in Mayan culture?

186
00:09:04.763 --> 00:09:08.385
Where were some of the original touching points with that?

187
00:09:10.991 --> 00:09:13.635
<v ->You know, you don't find any old textbooks--</v>

188
00:09:13.635 --> 00:09:14.840
<v Woman>Oh, that's for sure.</v>

189
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.237
<v ->That are talking about it.</v>

190
00:09:16.237 --> 00:09:18.189
But what they're doing is they're relating

191
00:09:18.189 --> 00:09:20.565
periods in history

192
00:09:23.735 --> 00:09:27.945
to a zodiacal sign, to one of the constellations.

193
00:09:28.931 --> 00:09:31.052
They use the constellations to mark

194
00:09:31.052 --> 00:09:34.178
very long periods of time, and so I should probably

195
00:09:34.178 --> 00:09:35.496
explain what the precession equinox is.

196
00:09:35.496 --> 00:09:37.755
<v Woman>Yes, please because I think that's appropriate now</v>

197
00:09:37.755 --> 00:09:41.915
because it has shown up in the pictographs and so forth

198
00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:44.215
throughout history, so please, let's talk about

199
00:09:44.215 --> 00:09:46.018
the precession of the equinox.

200
00:09:46.018 --> 00:09:48.321
Keep it simple for us, if you can.

201
00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:50.615
And some of the illustrations historically

202
00:09:50.615 --> 00:09:52.748
that would bare this out.

203
00:09:52.748 --> 00:09:54.091
<v ->Okay.</v>

204
00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:57.054
So, all over the world you find megalithic sites.

205
00:09:58.484 --> 00:10:01.821
You know, there's obelisks, there's henges,

206
00:10:01.821 --> 00:10:05.181
there's pyramids, cairns, dolmens,

207
00:10:05.181 --> 00:10:07.815
and they all seem to be aligned with equinox,

208
00:10:07.815 --> 00:10:11.254
solstice, or cardinal points.

209
00:10:11.254 --> 00:10:14.032
So, they were very interested in

210
00:10:14.032 --> 00:10:16.998
monitoring the motions of the heavens.

211
00:10:16.998 --> 00:10:19.184
<v Woman>Not just for growing crops?</v>

212
00:10:19.184 --> 00:10:21.317
<v ->No, the Stone Henge--</v>

213
00:10:21.317 --> 00:10:23.088
<v Woman>It's not sounding like it any more.</v>

214
00:10:23.088 --> 00:10:26.053
<v ->Story we were taught, mankind was a hunter-gatherer,</v>

215
00:10:26.053 --> 00:10:29.604
wasn't quite making it, and therefore he needed a clock,

216
00:10:29.604 --> 00:10:31.524
to know when to plant crops.

217
00:10:31.524 --> 00:10:35.620
So, he goes and cuts 50 to 100 ton stones,

218
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.756
hauls them across, you know you can't even get trucks

219
00:10:38.756 --> 00:10:43.672
across that ground without a road, and erects them.

220
00:10:43.672 --> 00:10:46.723
Somehow knows how to erect it all in the right way,

221
00:10:46.723 --> 00:10:49.198
so that he can then go back to farming.

222
00:10:49.198 --> 00:10:50.862
It doesn't make sense.

223
00:10:50.862 --> 00:10:53.710
But precession of the equinox is simply,

224
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:58.061
if you look east, due east, on the date of the equinox,

225
00:10:58.061 --> 00:11:01.157
the equinox is simply the day of the year

226
00:11:01.157 --> 00:11:03.524
where the day and the night are of equal length,

227
00:11:03.524 --> 00:11:08.486
really easy to plot, and you look at sunrise,

228
00:11:08.486 --> 00:11:12.623
you will notice there's a constellation there.

229
00:11:13.696 --> 00:11:16.949
If you looked about 2,000 years ago on the spring equinox,

230
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:19.733
you would have noticed Pisces coming into view.

231
00:11:19.733 --> 00:11:23.239
<v Woman>And that's what a lot of these features of these</v>

232
00:11:23.239 --> 00:11:26.431
ancient monuments do, is they have, basically,

233
00:11:26.431 --> 00:11:29.052
apertures built-in to be able to

234
00:11:29.052 --> 00:11:31.451
watch the changing constellations.

235
00:11:31.451 --> 00:11:33.769
So, you were saying they were observatories of sorts?

236
00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:35.311
<v ->Yes.</v>

237
00:11:35.311 --> 00:11:39.419
Many do, and many they used natural features.

238
00:11:39.419 --> 00:11:43.600
You'd see a stone, a platform comes to a point.

239
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.019
There might be a wall there.

240
00:11:45.019 --> 00:11:46.745
And then there's a mountain in the horizon.

241
00:11:46.745 --> 00:11:47.478
<v Woman>Right.</v>

242
00:11:47.478 --> 00:11:48.397
<v ->And, so that's--</v>

243
00:11:48.397 --> 00:11:50.154
<v Woman>Watch where the sun is rising and setting</v>

244
00:11:50.154 --> 00:11:52.216
in relationship to the mountain or the moon.

245
00:11:52.216 --> 00:11:53.123
<v ->Terrific marker.</v>

246
00:11:53.123 --> 00:11:54.784
<v Woman>So this is all over the world.</v>

247
00:11:54.784 --> 00:11:57.080
These monuments are dotted all over the world.

248
00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.957
So this was common, to watch the stars

249
00:11:58.957 --> 00:12:01.409
to track time and periods of history then.

250
00:12:01.409 --> 00:12:02.135
<v ->Right.</v>

251
00:12:02.135 --> 00:12:04.663
<v Woman>So let's continue on the precession.</v>

252
00:12:04.663 --> 00:12:08.417
<v ->So, the equinox, then, is the day you do it.</v>

253
00:12:08.417 --> 00:12:11.524
So on the spring equinox, had you looked, say,

254
00:12:11.524 --> 00:12:14.657
2,000 years ago Pisces is there, and if you look now

255
00:12:14.657 --> 00:12:17.110
Pisces is setting and we're at

256
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.743
the dawning of the Age of Aquarius.

257
00:12:19.743 --> 00:12:23.585
This really doesn't have anything to do with astrology,

258
00:12:23.585 --> 00:12:26.593
'cause astronomers use these as markers, also.

259
00:12:26.593 --> 00:12:30.063
They'll say there's a comet coming from Gemini,

260
00:12:30.063 --> 00:12:32.277
or from the area of Taurus,

261
00:12:32.277 --> 00:12:35.655
'cause everybody knows these twelve ancient constellations.

262
00:12:35.655 --> 00:12:36.368
<v Woman>Right, if--</v>

263
00:12:36.368 --> 00:12:39.584
<v ->So, if they tied these two ages,</v>

264
00:12:39.584 --> 00:12:44.039
and you'll find when the spring equinox

265
00:12:44.039 --> 00:12:46.489
was in Taurus that

266
00:12:46.489 --> 00:12:49.247
there's a lot of bulls all over the world.

267
00:12:50.432 --> 00:12:51.471
Icons.

268
00:12:52.067 --> 00:12:53.498
Then a little later, you find

269
00:12:53.498 --> 00:12:56.876
a lot of rams in the Age of Aries.

270
00:12:56.876 --> 00:13:00.397
A lot of fish signs in the age of Pisces, et cetera.

271
00:13:00.397 --> 00:13:02.552
So, they seem to be tuned into it

272
00:13:02.552 --> 00:13:05.093
and they talked about it in their text.

273
00:13:06.166 --> 00:13:08.319
There's a Syrianologist,

274
00:13:08.319 --> 00:13:11.104
one of the very best in the world, Stefan Maul.

275
00:13:11.104 --> 00:13:13.736
He spoke at Stanford, and you can

276
00:13:13.736 --> 00:13:18.321
find this on the net, where he's astounded to learn that,

277
00:13:18.321 --> 00:13:21.572
reading these cuneiform texts, that they keep referring

278
00:13:21.572 --> 00:13:24.782
to the past as if it's the future,

279
00:13:24.782 --> 00:13:27.097
and the future as if it's the past,

280
00:13:27.097 --> 00:13:30.251
and they look at the past as

281
00:13:30.251 --> 00:13:34.026
a glorious, wonderful time,

282
00:13:34.026 --> 00:13:36.223
and they know they're in decline

283
00:13:36.223 --> 00:13:40.425
and they're almost fearful of the future.

284
00:13:40.425 --> 00:13:44.446
And it's not just in the Mid-East.

285
00:13:44.446 --> 00:13:45.640
Other cultures talk about this.

286
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.040
The Hopi culture is one.

287
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.885
<v Woman>The Christian culture, Armageddon.</v>

288
00:13:49.885 --> 00:13:51.432
<v ->The Christian culture, the Greeks, Hesiod.</v>

289
00:13:51.432 --> 00:13:53.469
<v Woman>Yes, yes, it's everywhere.</v>

290
00:13:53.469 --> 00:13:55.827
<v ->He said the golden ages are absolutely beautiful.</v>

291
00:13:55.827 --> 00:14:00.301
And so they relate this cycle to time, and that

292
00:14:00.301 --> 00:14:05.013
really got me going to the time,

293
00:14:05.013 --> 00:14:06.986
an astronomical time.

294
00:14:06.986 --> 00:14:09.325
Focused me on astronomy.

295
00:14:11.656 --> 00:14:14.824
I guess the real turning point for me was

296
00:14:14.824 --> 00:14:17.181
finding a little book called The Holy Science

297
00:14:17.181 --> 00:14:19.628
by Swami Sri Yukteswar.

298
00:14:20.775 --> 00:14:24.615
He lived about late 1800s, early 1900s.

299
00:14:24.615 --> 00:14:26.858
Wrote this book in 1895.

300
00:14:28.251 --> 00:14:32.107
He said in there, as clearly as I've ever seen it,

301
00:14:32.107 --> 00:14:35.237
that planets turn on their axis

302
00:14:35.237 --> 00:14:38.266
and, with their moons, revolve around the sun,

303
00:14:38.266 --> 00:14:41.679
and the sun takes another star and goes around that,

304
00:14:41.679 --> 00:14:44.143
in a period of about 24,000 years,

305
00:14:44.143 --> 00:14:46.234
and this produces the backward motion

306
00:14:46.234 --> 00:14:48.975
of the equinox through the zodiac.

307
00:14:48.975 --> 00:14:50.662
So he made three points.

308
00:14:50.662 --> 00:14:53.079
We're in a binary star system.

309
00:14:53.079 --> 00:14:55.502
It takes 24,000 years to get around,

310
00:14:55.502 --> 00:14:58.071
which is just about the precession time period.

311
00:14:58.071 --> 00:14:58.853
<v Woman>Right.</v>

312
00:14:58.853 --> 00:15:00.610
<v ->And he says it's the cause of the movement</v>

313
00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.274
of the equinox through the zodiac,

314
00:15:02.274 --> 00:15:04.674
which we know as the precession of the equinox.

315
00:15:04.674 --> 00:15:08.514
<v Woman>So this would be the incline and decline</v>

316
00:15:08.514 --> 00:15:11.884
of civilizations, and again,

317
00:15:11.884 --> 00:15:15.190
of consciousness, of art, science, et cetera.

318
00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:18.431
<v ->Yes, and then he related it to the Yugas,</v>

319
00:15:18.431 --> 00:15:20.287
just as the ancients did.

320
00:15:20.287 --> 00:15:22.441
And he's not a guy that took credit for it.

321
00:15:22.441 --> 00:15:25.556
He just said, "according to Oriental astronomy"

322
00:15:25.556 --> 00:15:27.860
as if everyone knew this in the east

323
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.200
and have been going on for thousands of years.

324
00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:35.174
And he was very aware of western science, too.

325
00:15:35.174 --> 00:15:38.022
He was in correspondence, we know, with the west,

326
00:15:38.022 --> 00:15:41.994
and yet he didn't quote Newton

327
00:15:41.994 --> 00:15:46.266
or a modern viewpoint about

328
00:15:46.266 --> 00:15:47.720
the precession of the equinox.

329
00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.012
<v Woman>As I understand it, it wasn't</v>

330
00:15:51.012 --> 00:15:54.623
a very lengthy discourse on this, either.

331
00:15:54.623 --> 00:15:56.532
You really only got some tidbits out of that,

332
00:15:56.532 --> 00:15:59.113
to spark your own curiosity to drive forward.

333
00:15:59.113 --> 00:16:01.855
<v ->It is one run-on sentence in the introduction</v>

334
00:16:01.855 --> 00:16:05.028
to a book that's about something else, yes.

335
00:16:05.028 --> 00:16:06.448
<v Woman>Wow, what an amazing nugget.</v>

336
00:16:06.448 --> 00:16:10.013
So when you came in contact with this information,

337
00:16:10.013 --> 00:16:12.168
which is, now we're starting to get to the kernel

338
00:16:12.168 --> 00:16:15.269
of what you're doing, what must have

339
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:18.373
intrigued you most was this notion of a binary star system.

340
00:16:18.373 --> 00:16:21.689
In other words, the sun has a companion star.

341
00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:24.718
<v ->Yes, and there's some myth and folklore about this.</v>

342
00:16:24.718 --> 00:16:27.281
You'll find it in the Mithraic culture.

343
00:16:29.485 --> 00:16:33.015
The Norse myths refer to Fenja and Menja

344
00:16:33.015 --> 00:16:34.946
that turn the world axis,

345
00:16:34.946 --> 00:16:37.708
cause these world ages, two giantesses.

346
00:16:37.708 --> 00:16:40.323
and of course throughout Egypt

347
00:16:40.323 --> 00:16:44.740
there's this relationship

348
00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.481
between the gods,

349
00:16:47.481 --> 00:16:52.298
that also have star names, and culture there.

350
00:16:52.298 --> 00:16:56.382
And so it really focused me to see if we might be

351
00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:57.931
in a binary star system.

352
00:16:59.503 --> 00:17:04.324
I remember as a little boy that binary stars, double stars,

353
00:17:04.324 --> 00:17:06.469
were considered to be very rare.

354
00:17:07.342 --> 00:17:11.770
When I relooked at all the literature on that,

355
00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:12.850
late 1990s.

356
00:17:13.988 --> 00:17:17.848
By then it had been known that over 50% of all stars

357
00:17:17.848 --> 00:17:21.248
are in binary or multiple relationships.

358
00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:22.729
So then that strikes you as odd

359
00:17:22.729 --> 00:17:25.802
that the sun is really an anomaly.

360
00:17:25.802 --> 00:17:28.425
The latest NASA figure is over 80% of all stars

361
00:17:28.425 --> 00:17:30.718
are in binary or multiple relationships.

362
00:17:30.718 --> 00:17:32.235
So why wouldn't we be in one?

363
00:17:33.365 --> 00:17:35.782
And if we were in one, could it produce

364
00:17:35.782 --> 00:17:38.142
this precession of the equinox?

365
00:17:42.071 --> 00:17:43.682
<v Woman>And we have some beautiful graphics</v>

366
00:17:43.682 --> 00:17:45.955
that we'll show here while you're talking about this,

367
00:17:45.955 --> 00:17:50.142
so go ahead and continue please.

368
00:17:50.142 --> 00:17:52.584
<v ->So that spawned me to get serious.</v>

369
00:17:52.584 --> 00:17:56.157
By that time I had sold my businesses

370
00:17:56.157 --> 00:17:59.837
and I figured, heck, let's really go for it

371
00:17:59.837 --> 00:18:01.118
and see if it's real.

372
00:18:01.118 --> 00:18:04.206
I established the Binary Research Institute.

373
00:18:04.206 --> 00:18:06.966
We hired a full-time mathematician,

374
00:18:06.966 --> 00:18:11.291
full-time astrophysicist, and consulted with others

375
00:18:11.291 --> 00:18:14.199
to really dig into precession.

376
00:18:14.199 --> 00:18:17.517
You see, Copernicus said the cause of precession

377
00:18:17.517 --> 00:18:20.216
was the earth wobbling, but he really didn't check it,

378
00:18:20.216 --> 00:18:22.840
'cause he wrote that in 1543.

379
00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.110
And then Newton came along 100 years later and said,

380
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:28.008
well, if the earth does wobble it must be

381
00:18:28.008 --> 00:18:32.134
due to the influence of the moon

382
00:18:32.134 --> 00:18:37.134
on the oblate earth, which is a logical conclusion.

383
00:18:37.248 --> 00:18:39.989
But his equations never quite worked,

384
00:18:39.989 --> 00:18:42.773
so they were changed by d'Alembert,

385
00:18:42.773 --> 00:18:46.754
and then on and on they've been tweaked ever since.

386
00:18:47.827 --> 00:18:50.697
So we found that the current theory

387
00:18:50.697 --> 00:18:53.129
really has a lot of holes in it,

388
00:18:53.129 --> 00:18:55.725
and very very few people understand it.

389
00:18:55.725 --> 00:18:59.234
But there was really no credible theory to replace it.

390
00:19:01.927 --> 00:19:05.261
I guess that the clearest, simplest proof

391
00:19:05.261 --> 00:19:10.005
that the earth's axis doesn't wobble is that

392
00:19:10.005 --> 00:19:13.772
when you measure the amount of the wobble,

393
00:19:13.772 --> 00:19:16.406
the earth's motion relative to inertial space,

394
00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:19.340
the distant stars, you can see that

395
00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.748
it seems to move 50 arcseconds per year.

396
00:19:21.748 --> 00:19:24.084
That's why everybody agrees on it.

397
00:19:24.084 --> 00:19:25.705
But when you measure it relative to

398
00:19:25.705 --> 00:19:27.583
objects within the solar system,

399
00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:29.897
which really hasn't been done because everything's moving,

400
00:19:29.897 --> 00:19:31.135
it's very hard to measure--

401
00:19:31.135 --> 00:19:32.051
<v Woman>Right.</v>

402
00:19:32.051 --> 00:19:36.280
<v ->We find that it doesn't move at all, and so</v>

403
00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.491
the only way you could have that paradox

404
00:19:39.491 --> 00:19:42.339
is if the solar system is curving through space,

405
00:19:42.339 --> 00:19:45.443
producing what we call precession,

406
00:19:45.443 --> 00:19:47.544
but it's really a geometric effect.

407
00:19:49.499 --> 00:19:50.513
<v Woman>Continue, please.</v>

408
00:19:50.513 --> 00:19:54.704
<v ->Let me relate that just to the way</v>

409
00:19:54.704 --> 00:19:56.795
people used to think in the Dark Ages.

410
00:19:56.795 --> 00:19:57.828
We had known we were in

411
00:19:57.828 --> 00:20:01.618
a heliocentric system in the higher ages.

412
00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:03.167
The Greeks wrote about it.

413
00:20:03.167 --> 00:20:06.079
Aristarchus of Samos, Philolaus,

414
00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:09.811
Archimedes talked about it, and then it sort of

415
00:20:09.811 --> 00:20:12.053
drifted away as we went into the Dark Ages

416
00:20:12.053 --> 00:20:16.937
and everybody believed the earth was just a solid

417
00:20:16.937 --> 00:20:21.513
and it wasn't spinning, and if you told somebody that,

418
00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:24.712
"Hey, the earth is spinning

419
00:20:24.712 --> 00:20:26.972
"and the sun really doesn't go around with us,"

420
00:20:26.972 --> 00:20:28.753
I imagine they'd say, "Hey, wait a second,

421
00:20:28.753 --> 00:20:31.356
"I don't feel it spinning and I saw the sunrise there,

422
00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:34.043
"and it's overhead now, and it's gonna set there."

423
00:20:34.043 --> 00:20:35.153
<v Woman>Yeah, I watch it move.</v>

424
00:20:35.153 --> 00:20:37.659
<v ->The sun is going around us, and they'd think you're crazy.</v>

425
00:20:37.659 --> 00:20:41.104
But what they forgot was a reference frame.

426
00:20:41.104 --> 00:20:45.784
They forgot they were observing it from a moving earth,

427
00:20:45.784 --> 00:20:47.986
and the same thing is going on today.

428
00:20:47.986 --> 00:20:50.429
Our scientists have essentially forgot

429
00:20:50.429 --> 00:20:52.135
that we're in a moving solar system.

430
00:20:52.135 --> 00:20:54.610
It is gently curving through space,

431
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:56.647
producing the observable we call

432
00:20:56.647 --> 00:20:58.417
the precession of the equinox.

433
00:20:59.249 --> 00:21:02.118
<v Woman>So, this is huge.</v>

434
00:21:03.617 --> 00:21:05.782
First of all, how is this information

435
00:21:05.782 --> 00:21:09.424
being received by astrophysicists?

436
00:21:10.785 --> 00:21:11.631
<v ->Well...</v>

437
00:21:12.898 --> 00:21:13.996
<v Woman>Will they consider it?</v>

438
00:21:13.996 --> 00:21:15.411
<v ->That's a great question.
<v Woman>Yeah.</v>

439
00:21:15.411 --> 00:21:18.435
<v Walter>We've talked to some, and I think at first</v>

440
00:21:18.435 --> 00:21:22.861
we talked to just a couple,

441
00:21:22.861 --> 00:21:27.166
before we had a lot of data to back it up, and they said,

442
00:21:27.166 --> 00:21:31.315
"hey, we've got plenty of people working on this problem.

443
00:21:31.315 --> 00:21:34.418
"They're a lot smarter than you are about this field."

444
00:21:34.418 --> 00:21:38.505
And, you know, they didn't want to

445
00:21:38.505 --> 00:21:41.531
have a meeting or look at any data.

446
00:21:41.531 --> 00:21:43.173
<v Woman>But then you hired your mathematicians</v>

447
00:21:43.173 --> 00:21:44.923
<v Woman>and everyone.</v>
<v Walter>Since then, right.</v>

448
00:21:44.923 --> 00:21:47.446
So now we've put together some very good proofs.

449
00:21:47.446 --> 00:21:51.009
And I'm not going back to the main guys yet.

450
00:21:51.009 --> 00:21:54.675
We're talking to other astronomers around the world

451
00:21:54.675 --> 00:21:58.618
to check out certain of our proofs,

452
00:21:58.618 --> 00:22:02.035
and we've found that not a lot of people

453
00:22:02.035 --> 00:22:04.691
really understand precession.

454
00:22:04.691 --> 00:22:08.776
They may track near-earth asteroids,

455
00:22:08.776 --> 00:22:12.720
or they're in radio astronomy,

456
00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.055
or they're hypothesizing about

457
00:22:15.055 --> 00:22:17.715
distant galaxies or something.

458
00:22:17.715 --> 00:22:20.740
But it's kinda just been assumed that

459
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.552
anything to do with the solar system

460
00:22:22.552 --> 00:22:24.292
is kind of figured out by now.

461
00:22:26.996 --> 00:22:30.078
So they always say it can't be, then they say, well,

462
00:22:30.078 --> 00:22:32.211
that's pretty good data.

463
00:22:32.211 --> 00:22:33.416
That might be.

464
00:22:33.416 --> 00:22:34.856
Talk to so-and-so,

465
00:22:34.856 --> 00:22:36.242
but it's not my field.

466
00:22:36.242 --> 00:22:40.889
So I've heard that probably a couple dozen times.

467
00:22:40.889 --> 00:22:45.889
And so we continue to move along and build our proofs

468
00:22:45.896 --> 00:22:49.626
and we've written a couple papers on it,

469
00:22:49.626 --> 00:22:52.655
but I'm finding that science is marketing

470
00:22:52.655 --> 00:22:56.420
to a certain degree, especially when it's a subtle point

471
00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:57.966
that hardly anybody understands.

472
00:22:57.966 --> 00:23:01.379
You have to get 100 or 1,000 people to buy off on it,

473
00:23:01.379 --> 00:23:03.524
and say they don't see any problems with it

474
00:23:03.524 --> 00:23:05.273
before it's kind of accepted.

475
00:23:05.273 --> 00:23:07.885
<v Woman>May or may not happen in your lifetime.</v>

476
00:23:07.885 --> 00:23:10.681
<v ->I think precession will, because our proofs are getting</v>

477
00:23:10.681 --> 00:23:12.281
stronger and stronger all the time.

478
00:23:12.281 --> 00:23:16.611
We're seeing things that are sort of ah-ha.

479
00:23:18.231 --> 00:23:21.021
<v Woman>And this links back to the Mayan calendar,</v>

480
00:23:21.021 --> 00:23:23.877
the precession, does it not?

481
00:23:23.877 --> 00:23:25.145
<v ->It does, yeah.
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

482
00:23:25.145 --> 00:23:27.419
<v Walter>'Cause all these ancient cultures</v>

483
00:23:27.419 --> 00:23:29.383
seem to talk about it.

484
00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.058
But the bigger question, I think,

485
00:23:33.058 --> 00:23:36.248
is if precession is caused by

486
00:23:36.248 --> 00:23:38.381
the solar system's curve through space,

487
00:23:38.381 --> 00:23:39.682
what are we curving around?

488
00:23:39.682 --> 00:23:42.581
You know, it takes a very big mass to move our solar system.

489
00:23:42.581 --> 00:23:43.860
<v Woman>Solar system, mm-hm.</v>

490
00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.563
<v ->And so there's two scenarios.</v>

491
00:23:46.563 --> 00:23:50.688
One is purely Newtonian dynamics,

492
00:23:50.688 --> 00:23:54.295
and it must be a dark star of some kind.

493
00:23:54.295 --> 00:23:57.036
A brown dwarf, maybe even a black hole

494
00:23:57.036 --> 00:23:59.030
or some planet-like mass.

495
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:03.169
And according to Newtonian dynamics, if it's a brown dwarf,

496
00:24:03.169 --> 00:24:05.611
just a fraction of the sun's mass,

497
00:24:05.611 --> 00:24:08.174
it's probably only 800 AU away.

498
00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:12.285
1 AU is an astronomical unit,

499
00:24:12.285 --> 00:24:14.016
the distance between the earth and the sun.

500
00:24:16.027 --> 00:24:20.452
Or if it's black hole, which seems very improbable,

501
00:24:20.452 --> 00:24:23.746
it being maybe 1500 AU away.

502
00:24:23.746 --> 00:24:26.370
And yet, we haven't seen anything like that.

503
00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:30.431
So it makes us question whether or not gravity,

504
00:24:30.431 --> 00:24:33.492
really, we have a full understanding of it.

505
00:24:33.492 --> 00:24:36.051
Especially when all the myth and folklore that refer to it

506
00:24:36.051 --> 00:24:38.722
are talking about a visible star.

507
00:24:41.235 --> 00:24:43.816
Gravity is just like the Wild West right now.

508
00:24:43.816 --> 00:24:46.634
There's a lot of anomalies.

509
00:24:46.634 --> 00:24:51.323
The Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft are off course.

510
00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:54.234
Ulysses and Galileo, they saw similar things

511
00:24:54.234 --> 00:24:56.412
when they were still in existence.

512
00:24:58.423 --> 00:24:59.841
It seems to happen towards the

513
00:24:59.841 --> 00:25:01.663
outer edges of the solar system.

514
00:25:01.663 --> 00:25:04.511
So some new people are writing theories.

515
00:25:04.511 --> 00:25:08.496
The latest Scientific America's talking about it right now.

516
00:25:08.496 --> 00:25:12.269
And I think that we'll find out that

517
00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:14.647
gravity works a little differently in big space

518
00:25:14.647 --> 00:25:17.581
than it does in the local solar system,

519
00:25:18.469 --> 00:25:21.079
and that may allow, then,

520
00:25:21.079 --> 00:25:23.958
the speeds we're looking for

521
00:25:23.958 --> 00:25:27.851
for the solar system to get around a nearby visible star.

522
00:25:27.851 --> 00:25:31.690
And, a matter of fact, there's a scientist in Australia,

523
00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:34.677
Reg Cahill, who has recently come out with

524
00:25:34.677 --> 00:25:37.018
a speed for the solar system

525
00:25:37.018 --> 00:25:41.398
that gets us around a nearby star

526
00:25:41.398 --> 00:25:43.744
within the precession period.

527
00:25:43.744 --> 00:25:45.992
<v Woman>Interesting, which is, in essence, a window</v>

528
00:25:45.992 --> 00:25:48.296
between 24,000 and 26,000 years.

529
00:25:48.296 --> 00:25:49.032
<v ->Yes.</v>

530
00:25:49.032 --> 00:25:51.101
<v Woman>Depending on who's calculating, and--</v>

531
00:25:51.101 --> 00:25:53.877
<v ->It currently tracks out</v>

532
00:25:53.877 --> 00:25:57.088
at 25,669 years.

533
00:25:57.088 --> 00:26:01.088
That's based on precession being 50.29 arcseconds a year.

534
00:26:01.088 --> 00:26:04.514
But the precession rate, this is another anomaly,

535
00:26:04.514 --> 00:26:06.871
is increasing each year, so therefore

536
00:26:06.871 --> 00:26:08.983
the periodicity is declining.

537
00:26:08.983 --> 00:26:09.698
<v Woman>Right.</v>

538
00:26:09.698 --> 00:26:10.428
<v ->And we think--</v>

539
00:26:10.428 --> 00:26:11.272
<v Woman>Speeding up.</v>

540
00:26:11.272 --> 00:26:15.665
<v ->It may well come out to a 24,000 year average cycle.</v>

541
00:26:15.665 --> 00:26:18.698
<v Woman>So what are the implications of this in terms of</v>

542
00:26:18.698 --> 00:26:23.051
where we are in the midst of this precession, here on earth?

543
00:26:24.873 --> 00:26:28.734
When you have the growth and decline of civilizations,

544
00:26:28.734 --> 00:26:30.499
and I will use the word consciousness

545
00:26:30.499 --> 00:26:32.568
to permeate intellect, everything else.

546
00:26:32.568 --> 00:26:35.011
Where would you say we are on this?

547
00:26:35.011 --> 00:26:36.942
<v ->Well, first of all, I never talk to astronomers</v>

548
00:26:36.942 --> 00:26:38.935
about mythology, or--

549
00:26:38.935 --> 00:26:40.066
<v Woman>I'm sure you don't.</v>

550
00:26:40.066 --> 00:26:42.220
<v ->Rise and fall of history, or anything like that,</v>

551
00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.231
'cause we're just focusing on this one precession problem,

552
00:26:45.231 --> 00:26:48.216
and we think we can get that done within a few years.

553
00:26:48.216 --> 00:26:49.166
<v Woman>Right.</v>

554
00:26:49.166 --> 00:26:53.511
<v ->But yes, it's fascinating to me</v>

555
00:26:53.511 --> 00:26:57.125
that it's tied into this whole history cycle.

556
00:26:57.125 --> 00:27:00.868
And so the hypothesis, first,

557
00:27:00.868 --> 00:27:03.875
before we kinda get to where we are in the cycle,

558
00:27:03.875 --> 00:27:07.946
is that the rise and fall of civilization

559
00:27:07.946 --> 00:27:10.079
is related to this orbit

560
00:27:10.079 --> 00:27:13.297
of our solar system around another star,

561
00:27:13.297 --> 00:27:15.963
and as we get closer to this other star

562
00:27:15.963 --> 00:27:17.552
we seem to be at a high age,

563
00:27:17.552 --> 00:27:21.231
and as we go away from this star we seem to be at a low age.

564
00:27:21.231 --> 00:27:24.024
And you can tell by the precession rates.

565
00:27:24.024 --> 00:27:27.538
If precession's caused by an orbit it follows Kepler's laws.

566
00:27:29.795 --> 00:27:32.355
So it appears, since precession rate

567
00:27:32.355 --> 00:27:33.707
is increasing every year,

568
00:27:33.707 --> 00:27:37.637
and this drives the looney solar theorists crazy,

569
00:27:38.975 --> 00:27:42.464
that we are in a orbit that is going closer

570
00:27:42.464 --> 00:27:45.021
to the other star at this point.

571
00:27:45.021 --> 00:27:48.301
And indeed, if you look at the archeological record, we seem

572
00:27:48.301 --> 00:27:50.441
to have all these great civilizations around the world.

573
00:27:50.441 --> 00:27:52.637
They fell, probably bottomed out

574
00:27:52.637 --> 00:27:55.370
in what we call the Dark Ages.

575
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:58.016
Our scientists might not recognize a golden age,

576
00:27:58.016 --> 00:28:00.302
or historians won't, but they do recognize the dark age.

577
00:28:00.302 --> 00:28:01.859
<v Woman>The dark age, right.</v>

578
00:28:01.859 --> 00:28:04.099
<v ->And then we had a renaissance, rebirth,</v>

579
00:28:04.099 --> 00:28:07.351
and we've been kinda moving up since then.

580
00:28:07.351 --> 00:28:09.841
So, we're maybe 1,500 years

581
00:28:09.841 --> 00:28:14.241
since the depth of the darkest age, and it's--

582
00:28:14.241 --> 00:28:15.370
<v Woman>On the rise, then?</v>

583
00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:18.679
<v ->Yes, if it's a 24,000 year cycle</v>

584
00:28:18.679 --> 00:28:20.787
we're just barely out of the gross,

585
00:28:20.787 --> 00:28:24.382
material, dark, brutish age,

586
00:28:24.382 --> 00:28:27.985
into the point where we can

587
00:28:27.985 --> 00:28:30.916
start to understand atoms and molecules

588
00:28:30.916 --> 00:28:33.209
and forces and electricity and magnetism

589
00:28:33.209 --> 00:28:34.808
and realize that this thing isn't so solid.

590
00:28:34.808 --> 00:28:36.216
<v Woman>And binary star system.</v>

591
00:28:36.216 --> 00:28:38.507
<v ->And the binary star systems.</v>

592
00:28:38.507 --> 00:28:40.364
<v Woman>I don't know if you feel comfortable</v>

593
00:28:40.364 --> 00:28:44.407
commenting on this, the work of John Dering,

594
00:28:44.407 --> 00:28:46.881
and the notion that as we move through

595
00:28:46.881 --> 00:28:50.564
the precession of the equinox that we also have,

596
00:28:50.564 --> 00:28:53.187
there's an electromagnetic component of this,

597
00:28:53.187 --> 00:28:55.054
of the strengthening and dissipation

598
00:28:55.054 --> 00:28:59.085
of electromagnetic fields, which support life on earth,

599
00:28:59.085 --> 00:29:01.496
which support our bodies and our brain functioning

600
00:29:01.496 --> 00:29:03.733
and everything else, all of life here.

601
00:29:03.733 --> 00:29:04.494
<v ->Right.</v>

602
00:29:04.494 --> 00:29:07.895
<v Woman>So, how would what you're talking about,</v>

603
00:29:07.895 --> 00:29:10.007
in terms of this binary star system,

604
00:29:10.007 --> 00:29:12.900
this gravitational force between these two stars,

605
00:29:14.664 --> 00:29:16.428
generate or be impacted by the,

606
00:29:16.428 --> 00:29:19.766
how would the electromagnetic fields be impacted by this,

607
00:29:19.766 --> 00:29:21.547
I guess is what I'm trying to ask.

608
00:29:21.547 --> 00:29:26.535
<v ->Yes, well, you know, look at life.</v>

609
00:29:26.535 --> 00:29:31.007
The earth spins on it's axis, causes cycle of day and night,

610
00:29:31.007 --> 00:29:34.452
and that cycle is caused by whether or not

611
00:29:34.452 --> 00:29:37.908
we're facing this huge electromagnetic generator,

612
00:29:37.908 --> 00:29:40.915
called the sun, or whether we're facing away from it.

613
00:29:40.915 --> 00:29:44.552
And when we're facing it, we pick up this whole

614
00:29:44.552 --> 00:29:47.294
electromagnetic spectrum that runs from x-rays

615
00:29:47.294 --> 00:29:51.136
to gamma rays, infrared to ultraviolet.

616
00:29:51.136 --> 00:29:55.550
We just see visible light, but there's a lot going on there.

617
00:29:56.761 --> 00:30:00.320
It really affects all life.

618
00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.787
Same thing with the second motion of the earth.

619
00:30:02.787 --> 00:30:05.265
Goes around the sun on a slight axis.

620
00:30:05.265 --> 00:30:07.480
When we get more photons per square inch

621
00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:11.515
from this electromagnetic generator we call the sun,

622
00:30:11.519 --> 00:30:15.930
things spring out of the ground, yield their fruit, decay.

623
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:19.802
You know, fish spawn, birds fly south, bears hibernate.

624
00:30:19.802 --> 00:30:21.992
It affects all life.

625
00:30:21.992 --> 00:30:26.356
And all stars generate these huge EM fields.

626
00:30:27.102 --> 00:30:30.472
And I use the term EM field real broadly.

627
00:30:30.472 --> 00:30:31.627
<v Woman>Right.</v>

628
00:30:31.627 --> 00:30:36.097
<v ->So, if we're in a binary system going around another star,</v>

629
00:30:37.607 --> 00:30:41.539
we would get closer to that other star, but we would also

630
00:30:41.539 --> 00:30:45.483
be drawn closer to even other points in space

631
00:30:45.483 --> 00:30:48.120
as we go through this gigantic motion.

632
00:30:50.046 --> 00:30:51.528
I mentioned Reg Cahill.

633
00:30:51.528 --> 00:30:53.714
He says we're going

634
00:30:53.714 --> 00:30:56.497
450 kilometers a second.

635
00:30:56.497 --> 00:30:57.358
<v Woman>Amazing.</v>

636
00:30:57.358 --> 00:30:58.755
<v ->So we're moving at a pretty good speed.</v>

637
00:30:58.755 --> 00:30:59.673
<v Woman>Yeah, yeah.</v>

638
00:30:59.673 --> 00:31:02.125
<v ->So, if we get near another star, then,</v>

639
00:31:02.125 --> 00:31:04.800
that has this kind of effect,

640
00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:08.117
it might have an influence that

641
00:31:08.117 --> 00:31:11.445
we're not aware of on a very long-term scale.

642
00:31:11.445 --> 00:31:14.163
<v Woman>Well, I wonder about this because Gregg Braden,</v>

643
00:31:14.163 --> 00:31:16.370
a lot of his early work had to do with

644
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:19.032
the dissipation of the magnetic fields

645
00:31:19.032 --> 00:31:21.937
dropping away at this point in history,

646
00:31:21.937 --> 00:31:25.062
which seems to be relating to the precession,

647
00:31:25.062 --> 00:31:29.035
and John Dering was also

648
00:31:29.035 --> 00:31:30.783
discussing how this might work.

649
00:31:30.783 --> 00:31:34.420
I just find it interesting, the implications of

650
00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:35.658
what happens when you have

651
00:31:35.658 --> 00:31:40.227
a dissipating electromagnetic field and living beings.

652
00:31:41.043 --> 00:31:43.612
<v ->That's where we get to Valerie Hunt's work.</v>

653
00:31:43.612 --> 00:31:45.180
Did you interview John, by the way?

654
00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:46.815
<v Woman>I did not.</v>
<v Walter>Okay.</v>

655
00:31:46.815 --> 00:31:48.689
<v Woman>No, I had a hard time getting with him.</v>

656
00:31:48.689 --> 00:31:51.739
He was deluge with questions at the moment,

657
00:31:51.739 --> 00:31:53.830
and someone else was waiting for an interview, so--

658
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:54.545
<v ->Okay.</v>

659
00:31:54.545 --> 00:31:55.334
(woman laughing)

660
00:31:55.334 --> 00:31:57.087
Well, let me mention her work, then.

661
00:31:57.087 --> 00:31:58.234
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

662
00:31:58.234 --> 00:32:01.380
<v ->Valerie hunt is a professor of physiology,</v>

663
00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:04.923
former professor of physiology at UCLA,

664
00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:08.249
and she was studying electromagnetic effects.

665
00:32:09.673 --> 00:32:13.928
More so concerned about the detrimental effects, I think.

666
00:32:13.928 --> 00:32:15.567
<v Woman>Right.</v>

667
00:32:15.567 --> 00:32:19.765
<v ->So she had put people in a Faraday cage,</v>

668
00:32:19.765 --> 00:32:22.922
which is, you can essentially block out all the EM--

669
00:32:22.922 --> 00:32:24.789
<v Woman>And the Schumann waves, everything really.</v>

670
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:25.954
<v Walter>Yeah.</v>
<v Woman>Yeah.</v>

671
00:32:25.954 --> 00:32:29.654
<v Walter>And she wanted to see how people reacted,</v>

672
00:32:29.654 --> 00:32:31.295
performed on tests, this sort of thing.

673
00:32:31.295 --> 00:32:33.513
Well, it really wasn't the test so much,

674
00:32:33.513 --> 00:32:35.455
although they did perform poorly.

675
00:32:35.455 --> 00:32:37.662
People reacted emotionally

676
00:32:37.662 --> 00:32:42.267
and sobbed, cried,

677
00:32:42.267 --> 00:32:47.102
and that happened when the field is totally taken away,

678
00:32:47.102 --> 00:32:50.025
and they spent any time in there at all.

679
00:32:50.025 --> 00:32:51.870
And then when she adds it back,

680
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:54.761
and I think she was adding in something else, too,

681
00:32:54.761 --> 00:32:57.171
such as negative ions,

682
00:32:58.481 --> 00:33:02.258
people were happier, did better on the tests.

683
00:33:02.258 --> 00:33:04.897
And so that's a little microcosm of

684
00:33:04.897 --> 00:33:07.094
what might be happening to the earth.

685
00:33:07.094 --> 00:33:09.942
We get carried into a field and out of a field.

686
00:33:09.942 --> 00:33:13.825
But it goes on for a really long-term scale,

687
00:33:13.825 --> 00:33:15.787
so if we only looking at it over

688
00:33:15.787 --> 00:33:18.166
the last thousand years or so, we might say,

689
00:33:18.166 --> 00:33:21.536
boy, we're evolving very quickly.

690
00:33:21.536 --> 00:33:24.224
What was happening 5,000 years before that?

691
00:33:24.224 --> 00:33:25.600
<v Woman>Right, right.</v>

692
00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.085
<v ->We were devolving to some degree.</v>

693
00:33:28.085 --> 00:33:28.938
<v Woman>Right.</v>

694
00:33:28.938 --> 00:33:30.357
It was just a curious point,

695
00:33:30.357 --> 00:33:34.113
because it seems that the market is being flooded with

696
00:33:34.113 --> 00:33:38.782
devices which deflect negative radio frequencies,

697
00:33:38.782 --> 00:33:41.962
and which enhance the magnetic fields around the body,

698
00:33:41.962 --> 00:33:45.514
but the subject is becoming almost mainstream.

699
00:33:45.514 --> 00:33:48.522
You can go to any street fair and find magnetic bracelets

700
00:33:48.522 --> 00:33:52.244
and things like this, so it is entering mass consciousness.

701
00:33:52.244 --> 00:33:54.495
<v ->It is, and I think there's a lot of quackery</v>

702
00:33:54.495 --> 00:33:56.798
whenever you have stuff like that,

703
00:33:56.798 --> 00:33:59.277
but in Japan you can not sell

704
00:34:00.717 --> 00:34:03.079
an air purifier or a filter

705
00:34:03.079 --> 00:34:05.388
without having negative ions in it.

706
00:34:05.388 --> 00:34:06.114
<v Woman>Right.</v>

707
00:34:06.114 --> 00:34:07.768
<v ->There's been tons of studies on this.</v>

708
00:34:09.332 --> 00:34:11.284
So yeah, it's starting to creep in.

709
00:34:11.284 --> 00:34:13.321
<v Woman>I just brought it up as an aside,</v>

710
00:34:13.321 --> 00:34:16.683
because his work is that he is,

711
00:34:16.683 --> 00:34:19.305
from what I'm understanding in a simplistic view here,

712
00:34:19.305 --> 00:34:22.511
he's saying that the precession of the equinox

713
00:34:22.511 --> 00:34:24.818
and possibly the influence of what you were speaking about,

714
00:34:24.818 --> 00:34:27.527
the binary star system, is creating

715
00:34:27.527 --> 00:34:30.321
a growth and decline of electromagnetic fields

716
00:34:30.321 --> 00:34:34.255
which would have a distinct impact on human intellect.

717
00:34:34.255 --> 00:34:34.980
<v ->Yes.</v>

718
00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:38.714
Yeah, as we get near to other stars

719
00:34:38.714 --> 00:34:42.512
it impacts us just like the sun does.

720
00:34:42.982 --> 00:34:45.634
It impacts the ionosphere, magnetosphere,

721
00:34:45.634 --> 00:34:48.886
and indirectly, obviously, the planet.

722
00:34:48.886 --> 00:34:50.380
And you know, at an atomic level

723
00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:53.003
it's all one big dance of electrons.

724
00:34:53.973 --> 00:34:58.879
<v Woman>So, for the average person</v>

725
00:34:58.879 --> 00:35:02.730
going about their daily life, what does this news

726
00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:04.841
and potential mean to them,

727
00:35:04.841 --> 00:35:07.415
that we have now a sun

728
00:35:07.415 --> 00:35:09.983
with a companion star, perhaps?

729
00:35:09.983 --> 00:35:11.976
And then I'm going to ask you another question about that,

730
00:35:11.976 --> 00:35:13.885
but what does that mean to us?

731
00:35:13.885 --> 00:35:16.956
<v ->Well, I've been reflecting on that.</v>

732
00:35:16.956 --> 00:35:19.995
You know, my mission really is just to

733
00:35:19.995 --> 00:35:24.305
do the math, the science, solve this precession problem,

734
00:35:24.305 --> 00:35:26.491
and turn it over to others, 'cause there's people

735
00:35:26.491 --> 00:35:29.269
much smarter at it to figure out a lot of details.

736
00:35:30.308 --> 00:35:34.830
But I received an email from a school teacher,

737
00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:37.110
and she had seen our film The Great Year,

738
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:41.502
narrated by James Earl Jones, and it gives this story

739
00:35:41.502 --> 00:35:44.550
very simply about this great year cycle--

740
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:46.406
<v Woman>Yes I've seen it, it's well done.</v>

741
00:35:46.406 --> 00:35:48.962
<v ->That it might be caused by that binary orbit.</v>

742
00:35:48.962 --> 00:35:52.454
And she said she found herself crying

743
00:35:52.454 --> 00:35:54.757
at the end of the film, and she couldn't figure out

744
00:35:54.757 --> 00:35:58.889
why she was crying, and then she realized that

745
00:35:58.889 --> 00:36:02.255
as a little girl she had believed in a golden age,

746
00:36:02.255 --> 00:36:05.785
in a higher culture, and kind of always hoped that

747
00:36:05.785 --> 00:36:08.006
we would return to that.

748
00:36:10.595 --> 00:36:12.813
But she was told that it doesn't exist,

749
00:36:12.813 --> 00:36:16.957
it's not real, forget it, and,

750
00:36:18.697 --> 00:36:20.697
it lit a fire inside her.

751
00:36:20.697 --> 00:36:22.848
<v Woman>And I think as we go into</v>

752
00:36:22.848 --> 00:36:24.841
this interesting period of time,

753
00:36:24.841 --> 00:36:27.520
as we're in the midst of it, it seems a lot of people

754
00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.938
are starting to ask questions that

755
00:36:28.938 --> 00:36:31.562
weren't asked even 10, 20 years ago.

756
00:36:31.562 --> 00:36:36.009
<v ->Yes, I really think that the world is getting at a place</v>

757
00:36:36.009 --> 00:36:38.323
where you can not just keep having

758
00:36:38.323 --> 00:36:41.398
material solutions for everything.

759
00:36:44.423 --> 00:36:47.515
We as individuals often reach a point where

760
00:36:47.515 --> 00:36:49.999
you know, if we just live totally materially

761
00:36:49.999 --> 00:36:53.093
the soul dries out and we have a crisis until

762
00:36:53.093 --> 00:36:57.290
we get something better,

763
00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:59.136
and I think the world as a whole

764
00:36:59.136 --> 00:37:02.367
is kind of going through that, and we seem to be

765
00:37:02.367 --> 00:37:04.640
close to that point right now.

766
00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.934
<v Woman>It certainly seems so.</v>

767
00:37:05.934 --> 00:37:07.571
I have one final question for you.

768
00:37:07.571 --> 00:37:10.398
Do you have any ideas, thoughts, speculations

769
00:37:10.398 --> 00:37:12.962
on what that star may be?

770
00:37:15.168 --> 00:37:16.162
<v ->Yes.</v>

771
00:37:16.162 --> 00:37:17.424
<v Woman>Are you at liberty to say?</v>

772
00:37:17.424 --> 00:37:18.138
<v ->Sure.</v>

773
00:37:18.138 --> 00:37:22.776
Under Newtonian dynamics it can't be a visible star.

774
00:37:22.776 --> 00:37:27.054
Under some kind of modified Newtonian dynamics,

775
00:37:27.054 --> 00:37:30.840
probably more than MOND, it could be any of the

776
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:35.714
nearby stars and Sirius is the very best candidate.

777
00:37:35.714 --> 00:37:39.543
It is just written about throughout myth and folklore

778
00:37:39.543 --> 00:37:40.800
of virtually every culture.

779
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.686
<v Woman>Very true.</v>

780
00:37:41.686 --> 00:37:43.971
<v ->It's, you know, the whole Egyptian culture.</v>

781
00:37:43.971 --> 00:37:47.131
Isis is thought to be

782
00:37:47.131 --> 00:37:49.483
the bringer of life and the taker away,

783
00:37:49.483 --> 00:37:54.122
and modern archeologists say, well that's because

784
00:37:54.122 --> 00:37:57.578
Sirius is rising when the Nile floods,

785
00:37:57.578 --> 00:37:59.530
and so it's looked at very locally.

786
00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:02.237
I think it means something much greater.

787
00:38:02.237 --> 00:38:03.911
<v Woman>Well, as you're saying, and I'm getting</v>

788
00:38:03.911 --> 00:38:05.605
chills up and down,

789
00:38:05.605 --> 00:38:08.141
this is really astounding work you're doing.

790
00:38:08.141 --> 00:38:09.282
<v ->Well it's fun.</v>

791
00:38:09.282 --> 00:38:11.479
Yeah, we're really having a fun time with it.

792
00:38:11.479 --> 00:38:12.567
<v Woman>Reaching all of your</v>

793
00:38:12.567 --> 00:38:14.828
boyhood fantasies here? (laughs)

794
00:38:14.828 --> 00:38:18.007
<v ->Yeah, but we're focused on precession.</v>

795
00:38:18.007 --> 00:38:19.824
<v ->Let's get that out.
<v Woman>Yes, yes.</v>

796
00:38:19.824 --> 00:38:21.929
<v Walter>All these other things are attached to it,</v>

797
00:38:21.929 --> 00:38:24.735
but if we can really understand that

798
00:38:24.735 --> 00:38:29.358
the earth's axis is not just wobbling locally,

799
00:38:29.358 --> 00:38:33.240
then people have to look at what's going on,

800
00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.763
and it has a ripple effect.

801
00:38:35.763 --> 00:38:37.226
I think that'd be a good find.

802
00:38:37.226 --> 00:38:39.622
<v Woman>Thank you so much.</v>

803
00:38:39.622 --> 00:38:40.907
<v ->My pleasure.</v>

804
00:38:40.907 --> 00:38:44.670
(dramatic instrumental music)

805
00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:48.064
<v ->An incredible story, and he says in just a few short years</v>

806
00:38:48.064 --> 00:38:50.443
the science should be born out from mathematics.

807
00:38:50.443 --> 00:38:52.986
Until next time, thanks for watching.
