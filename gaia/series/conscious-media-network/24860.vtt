1
00:00:00.636 --> 00:00:02.560
<v ->If you need a little straight talk</v>

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.323
to pull yourself out of a rut or a suffering of some type,

3
00:00:05.323 --> 00:00:07.062
you'll love Guy Finley.

4
00:00:07.062 --> 00:00:08.692
Raised among the Hollywood elite,

5
00:00:08.692 --> 00:00:11.467
Guy understood early in life that wealth and possessions

6
00:00:11.467 --> 00:00:13.502
were no path to happiness.

7
00:00:13.502 --> 00:00:15.905
This awareness sent him on a lifelong quest

8
00:00:15.905 --> 00:00:19.539
to educate himself and others as to our innate wholeness.

9
00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.106
Wholeness that can be given birth to

10
00:00:21.106 --> 00:00:24.456
only when we become tired of our old stories.

11
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.795 line:15% 
(jazzy piano music)

12
00:00:33.842 --> 00:00:36.046
<v Regina>You're referred to by a lot of your peers</v>

13
00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:38.428
as a sparkling light out there in the world,

14
00:00:38.428 --> 00:00:40.284
and when I sat down with you

15
00:00:40.284 --> 00:00:41.765
for the first time--
<v ->What do they know?</v>

16
00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:43.018
(both laugh)

17
00:00:43.018 --> 00:00:44.461
<v Regina>When I first sat down with you,</v>

18
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:46.389
I thought, "My God, what beautiful eyes.

19
00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:48.374
"They literally are shining."

20
00:00:48.374 --> 00:00:51.474
So, you must have had a journey behind those eyes

21
00:00:51.474 --> 00:00:53.099
to get to this point in life.

22
00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:54.539
Would you mind telling us a little bit

23
00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.121
about where you began to bring you onto this path, yourself?

24
00:00:59.485 --> 00:01:02.194
<v ->The truth is, Regina, I was</v>

25
00:01:02.194 --> 00:01:04.143
born on it, in a way.

26
00:01:04.143 --> 00:01:06.723
From a very early age, I had a host of different

27
00:01:06.723 --> 00:01:10.230
experiences take place, not just interiorly,

28
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.172
but I was born into a show business family.

29
00:01:14.688 --> 00:01:17.799
My father is considered the progenitor,

30
00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.534
the father of late night television talk show.

31
00:01:20.534 --> 00:01:22.803
Before Johnny Carson and Jack Paar,

32
00:01:22.803 --> 00:01:24.940
there was Strictly Informal, Music is my Beat,

33
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.875
with Larry Finley, and my father, 1950-51,

34
00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:32.811
was the one running that and introducing that

35
00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:34.802
kind of genre to television.

36
00:01:34.935 --> 00:01:38.717
So, I grew up literally riding in the lap of Jayne Mansfield

37
00:01:38.717 --> 00:01:40.584
in the Hollywood Christmas Parade.

38
00:01:40.584 --> 00:01:42.424
(Regina laughs)

39
00:01:42.424 --> 00:01:43.527
<v Regina>I can't quite imagine that.</v>

40
00:01:43.527 --> 00:01:44.978
<v ->We can all have a good laugh at this.</v>

41
00:01:44.978 --> 00:01:46.033
<v Regina>No, it's great.</v>
<v ->And it's part of what's</v>

42
00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:47.543
caused me to be as crazy as I am

43
00:01:47.543 --> 00:01:48.927
<v Regina>I think it's wonderful.</v>

44
00:01:48.927 --> 00:01:50.599
You have an enviable position.

45
00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:52.596
<v ->Well, and then my running pals were</v>

46
00:01:52.596 --> 00:01:55.023
the kids, the Arnaz kids, and the Martin kids,

47
00:01:55.023 --> 00:01:56.401
and the Minnelli kids.

48
00:01:56.401 --> 00:01:59.653
Sinatra's kids, these were my friends growing up.

49
00:02:00.573 --> 00:02:02.006
And,

50
00:02:03.146 --> 00:02:05.383
coupled with my own interior life

51
00:02:05.383 --> 00:02:08.019
that started going through certain changes

52
00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.283
around 11 or 12 years old,

53
00:02:10.283 --> 00:02:14.590
there was this inexplicable contradiction

54
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.700
that existed between the lifestyle of the individuals

55
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.198
that I was born and raised with,

56
00:02:20.198 --> 00:02:22.692
which was all dysfunctional.

57
00:02:23.512 --> 00:02:26.266
And, how do you reconcile an immense

58
00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:30.394
amount of fear and anger with being

59
00:02:30.394 --> 00:02:33.885
the Illuminati of the world?

60
00:02:33.885 --> 00:02:37.609
And even though you can't put that in words as a child,

61
00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:42.380
it was so powerful to me that it made me,

62
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.191
it started grinding.

63
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:46.455
It introduced an early pain that could not

64
00:02:46.455 --> 00:02:49.399
be answered through common solutions.

65
00:02:49.845 --> 00:02:53.372
And that early pain that couldn't be responded to

66
00:02:53.372 --> 00:02:57.401
by more of what was actually producing the problem,

67
00:02:58.241 --> 00:03:01.293
led me to begin a very early search,

68
00:03:01.293 --> 00:03:04.869
that, by the grace of God, had early fruit in it for me.

69
00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:08.874
And I went through a circuitous route.

70
00:03:09.884 --> 00:03:12.014
I was the first white soft rock artist

71
00:03:12.014 --> 00:03:14.011
ever to sign with Motown Records.

72
00:03:14.011 --> 00:03:15.620
(both laugh)

73
00:03:16.217 --> 00:03:18.051
I worked with Neil Diamond,

74
00:03:18.051 --> 00:03:20.034
had several albums, wrote music for

75
00:03:20.034 --> 00:03:22.446
motion pictures and television.

76
00:03:24.857 --> 00:03:29.509
And then in '79, 1979, I turned 29 years old,

77
00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:31.219
I'd been very successful.

78
00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:32.804
I quit.

79
00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:35.132
It just wasn't working for me.

80
00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:36.339
<v Regina>Were you seeing in yourself</v>

81
00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:37.605
some of the dysfunction,

82
00:03:37.605 --> 00:03:40.310
or at least a dissatisfaction in what you saw

83
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.471
in some of the other?

84
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.642
<v ->I loved music.</v>

85
00:03:43.642 --> 00:03:45.651
I loved music.

86
00:03:45.651 --> 00:03:49.041
And it was great to be recognized at an early age.

87
00:03:49.041 --> 00:03:50.550
First white people to sign, you know,

88
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.493
big publishing company, "you're this, you're that,"

89
00:03:53.493 --> 00:03:56.559
hang out with Mr. Gordy and all the gang.

90
00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:58.535
But it wasn't very long before

91
00:03:58.535 --> 00:04:02.407
what I loved became my master in the wrong way.

92
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.133
Instead of loving to do what I did,

93
00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:08.558
I had to start having to do what I did.

94
00:04:09.028 --> 00:04:11.136
And that wasn't of interest to me.

95
00:04:11.136 --> 00:04:13.376
So, I quit, and I literally started

96
00:04:13.376 --> 00:04:14.677
traveling around the world.

97
00:04:14.677 --> 00:04:16.941
I went to the Far East, I traveled through India.

98
00:04:16.941 --> 00:04:20.888
I did a sojourn to see if I could find someone

99
00:04:20.888 --> 00:04:23.739
to help me start understanding some of this contradiction.

100
00:04:24.754 --> 00:04:27.570
Long story short, I found nothing that did.

101
00:04:27.587 --> 00:04:29.526
I dusted my head on more people's feet

102
00:04:29.526 --> 00:04:31.500
than you could possibly imagine.

103
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.418
Slapped by peacock feathers, I mean the whole thing.

104
00:04:35.795 --> 00:04:39.152
And I came home and realized that

105
00:04:39.152 --> 00:04:41.972
I had found something that no one else could have given me,

106
00:04:41.972 --> 00:04:43.435
which was that I was going to have

107
00:04:43.435 --> 00:04:45.822
to find this with myself, in myself.

108
00:04:46.173 --> 00:04:47.776
And then by very good fortune, and probably

109
00:04:47.776 --> 00:04:50.643
because of that realization, I met an extraordinary

110
00:04:50.643 --> 00:04:53.778
Christian mystic by the name of Vernon Howard.

111
00:04:53.778 --> 00:04:55.554
Been writing books for 35 years,

112
00:04:55.554 --> 00:04:58.851
a gentleman's gentleman, a true spirit.

113
00:04:58.851 --> 00:05:01.911
And I worked with him for 14 years until he died.

114
00:05:02.957 --> 00:05:05.160
<v Regina>What were you learning in that process</v>

115
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.834
with him, about yourself?

116
00:05:08.903 --> 00:05:12.221
<v ->I think more than anything else,</v>

117
00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:14.329
I was being introduced to

118
00:05:14.329 --> 00:05:17.181
what I had been running from all of my life.

119
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.513
We're all marathon runners,

120
00:05:20.513 --> 00:05:23.149
and we don't really know it, Regina, we are.

121
00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:24.275
<v Regina>What had you been running from,</v>

122
00:05:24.275 --> 00:05:25.842
if you care to share?

123
00:05:25.842 --> 00:05:27.979
<v ->The same thing everyone runs from,</v>

124
00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.073
the pain born of not knowing who we are.

125
00:05:31.705 --> 00:05:34.017
Exact same, it's no different.

126
00:05:34.017 --> 00:05:36.293
And it's that pain that makes us mean to each other,

127
00:05:36.293 --> 00:05:38.661
it's that pain that keeps us from being present

128
00:05:38.661 --> 00:05:41.157
because we're trying always to qualify ourselves

129
00:05:41.157 --> 00:05:43.276
in the eyes of the people around us.

130
00:05:43.502 --> 00:05:46.765
There's like this never-ending kind of hunger

131
00:05:46.765 --> 00:05:48.170
to find ourselves, but we're always

132
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.807
looking in the wrong place

133
00:05:49.807 --> 00:05:52.767
because no one has been kind enough

134
00:05:52.767 --> 00:05:54.945
to tell us that we're asleep,

135
00:05:54.945 --> 00:05:57.418
that we're wandering around lost,

136
00:05:57.418 --> 00:06:01.017
and that the road we're on doesn't lead anywhere

137
00:06:01.017 --> 00:06:02.248
except in a circle.

138
00:06:02.248 --> 00:06:07.022
And so, what seems to be an act of-- seems harsh, man!

139
00:06:07.022 --> 00:06:08.623
turns out to be the most gracious thing

140
00:06:08.623 --> 00:06:10.457
that an individual can do and say,

141
00:06:10.457 --> 00:06:13.301
which is, if you want to know what's wrong,

142
00:06:13.301 --> 00:06:14.625
you don't have to look any further

143
00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:16.564
than what you are in this moment.

144
00:06:16.564 --> 00:06:18.665
<v Regina>And in fact not only are</v>

145
00:06:18.665 --> 00:06:20.801
the various systems in place not kind enough

146
00:06:20.801 --> 00:06:22.671
to let us know that we're asleep and we're lost,

147
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:24.075
they actually exploit that.

148
00:06:24.075 --> 00:06:25.911
<v ->And they exploit it because</v>

149
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:28.579
they always give us the next thing to become.

150
00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:31.285
And not knowing any better, and I want to put this in

151
00:06:31.285 --> 00:06:34.014
'cause I like to make things as clear as I can,

152
00:06:34.014 --> 00:06:35.384
and I know we have a short time,

153
00:06:35.384 --> 00:06:37.322
which is tough with someone motor-mouth

154
00:06:37.322 --> 00:06:38.532
like I am.
(Regina laughs)

155
00:06:38.532 --> 00:06:41.009
<v Regina>With a lot to say.</v>

156
00:06:41.115 --> 00:06:43.588
<v ->We all are doing the best we can</v>

157
00:06:43.588 --> 00:06:47.616
in any given moment, even a man who does a hideous crime

158
00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:49.764
is the best that he knows to do.

159
00:06:49.764 --> 00:06:53.897
The issue is that our pain is the indication

160
00:06:53.897 --> 00:06:56.765
that there is more for us to know,

161
00:06:56.765 --> 00:06:59.377
not about what to do and be,

162
00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:01.212
but what it is that is driving us

163
00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.865
to compromise ourselves the way we do.

164
00:07:03.952 --> 00:07:07.806
And that was the road, was discovering over and over again

165
00:07:07.806 --> 00:07:10.848
in the early days where I was compromising myself thinking

166
00:07:10.848 --> 00:07:13.942
I was complementing my own life, my ambitions.

167
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.827
Mr. Howard just furthered that process

168
00:07:16.827 --> 00:07:19.997
by holding this mirror up that's so essential

169
00:07:19.997 --> 00:07:22.295
for us to look into in our lives.

170
00:07:22.295 --> 00:07:23.967
We don't think to ourselves that

171
00:07:23.967 --> 00:07:25.929
when I look at another human being,

172
00:07:25.929 --> 00:07:28.275
that I'm actually looking in a mirror.

173
00:07:28.275 --> 00:07:30.271
Because if I don't like what I see,

174
00:07:30.271 --> 00:07:32.700
this can't possibly be me.

175
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.363
But everything in life acts as a kind of mirror,

176
00:07:35.363 --> 00:07:37.630
I call it the point of revelation where,

177
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.350
no matter what's taking place,

178
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.288
if we're willing to see it, something is being revealed

179
00:07:42.288 --> 00:07:44.250
to us about ourselves.

180
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.154
And if I'm willing to look at that

181
00:07:46.154 --> 00:07:49.590
without judging myself or trying to fix what I see,

182
00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.390
then the light of awareness that makes

183
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:55.094
that relationship possible begins to make the change itself,

184
00:07:55.094 --> 00:07:57.532
and then you find this marvelous moment

185
00:07:57.532 --> 00:07:58.635
where you start to become

186
00:07:58.635 --> 00:08:00.362
a different kind of human being.

187
00:08:00.598 --> 00:08:02.247
<v Regina>The first step must be</v>

188
00:08:02.247 --> 00:08:04.795
that you have to, maybe, suspend judgment

189
00:08:04.795 --> 00:08:06.866
of whoever's across from you.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

190
00:08:06.866 --> 00:08:07.981
<v Regina>Then suspend judgment</v>

191
00:08:07.981 --> 00:08:09.049
of yourself.
<v ->Well, that's part of</v>

192
00:08:09.049 --> 00:08:10.342
the kindness, Regina.

193
00:08:10.342 --> 00:08:12.246
We keep in place all kinds

194
00:08:12.246 --> 00:08:14.255
of dysfunctional relationships,

195
00:08:14.255 --> 00:08:16.751
even when we meet somebody for the first time

196
00:08:16.751 --> 00:08:19.375
because if I look at you and I want something from you,

197
00:08:19.375 --> 00:08:22.858
I can't be honest; it's impossible.

198
00:08:22.858 --> 00:08:25.656
It's impossible, and then because I'm not honest

199
00:08:25.656 --> 00:08:28.594
that'll feed in you or whomever you're with

200
00:08:28.594 --> 00:08:31.820
a completely surreptitious relationship

201
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.702
that seems fulfilling, but turns out to be

202
00:08:34.702 --> 00:08:36.534
nothing but another source of suffering

203
00:08:36.534 --> 00:08:38.101
because it's as empty as everything else that

204
00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:39.309
you've done.
<v Regina>Leaves you feeling</v>

205
00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:41.770
cheap and empty.

206
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.033
Now, picking it up with what you were talking about

207
00:08:45.033 --> 00:08:46.913
this morning, which this leads into,

208
00:08:46.913 --> 00:08:48.550
you're talking about the path you took.

209
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.048
You said it was somewhat circuitous

210
00:08:50.048 --> 00:08:52.022
to come to this, in essence,

211
00:08:52.022 --> 00:08:54.390
very truthful and simple realization.

212
00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:55.981
And you said, "this is what happens:

213
00:08:55.981 --> 00:08:58.222
"There are two paths to freedom," you said in your talk,

214
00:08:58.222 --> 00:09:00.300
"and one is the gradual path, which is--"

215
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.227
<v ->The path of becoming.
<v Regina>Becoming,</v>

216
00:09:02.227 --> 00:09:04.166
and I'd like you to expand on that in a moment,

217
00:09:04.166 --> 00:09:05.629
and then there's the direct path,

218
00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:08.369
meaning there is nothing to achieve,

219
00:09:08.369 --> 00:09:10.667
to become, to be what you are.

220
00:09:10.667 --> 00:09:12.304
So can you talk about the gradual path,

221
00:09:12.304 --> 00:09:13.786
what that looks like?

222
00:09:13.786 --> 00:09:18.447
<v ->We're inculcated in this idea of becoming,</v>

223
00:09:18.447 --> 00:09:21.849
that if I can achieve or acquire this power,

224
00:09:21.849 --> 00:09:24.577
this possession, this authority,

225
00:09:24.577 --> 00:09:28.896
that through that I will begin to know myself

226
00:09:28.896 --> 00:09:32.657
not as feeling inadequate, but as being

227
00:09:32.657 --> 00:09:35.517
someone of worth and value.

228
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.835
Unseen through this path of becoming

229
00:09:37.835 --> 00:09:40.192
is that everyone that we find ourselves through,

230
00:09:40.192 --> 00:09:42.839
every position no matter what it is,

231
00:09:42.839 --> 00:09:46.694
becomes for us an unseen attachment, a dependency,

232
00:09:46.694 --> 00:09:49.643
because my sense of self is then defined by

233
00:09:49.643 --> 00:09:51.512
that person or condition.

234
00:09:51.512 --> 00:09:53.544
That person or condition changes,

235
00:09:53.544 --> 00:09:56.423
suddenly I feel as though I'm losing my life

236
00:09:56.423 --> 00:09:57.886
because it was defined through

237
00:09:57.886 --> 00:09:59.755
this derivative relationship.

238
00:09:59.755 --> 00:10:01.694
So, one suffers, then one begins

239
00:10:01.694 --> 00:10:04.737
the whole thing over again of looking to find a new way

240
00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:07.396
to define themselves through yet something else.

241
00:10:07.396 --> 00:10:10.252
That's the path of becoming; it never ends.

242
00:10:10.252 --> 00:10:11.854
<v Regina>So it's just constant inflation</v>

243
00:10:11.854 --> 00:10:13.038
and deflation
<v ->It never ends.</v>

244
00:10:13.038 --> 00:10:16.171
But the reason it never ends is because

245
00:10:16.171 --> 00:10:20.445
the self that is driving it, this divided mind,

246
00:10:20.445 --> 00:10:22.941
it doesn't want it to end.

247
00:10:22.941 --> 00:10:26.076
It wants that constant sense of satisfaction

248
00:10:26.076 --> 00:10:28.245
and dissatisfaction, these opposites

249
00:10:28.245 --> 00:10:30.880
flipping back and forth, so that it gets it,

250
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.019
it loses it--ahh, I lost it.

251
00:10:33.019 --> 00:10:35.085
Now I know what to do, I start over.

252
00:10:35.085 --> 00:10:37.059
And it just goes round and round and round.

253
00:10:37.059 --> 00:10:38.067
<v Regina>Now why would the mind</v>

254
00:10:38.067 --> 00:10:39.857
want to go into this kind of circle jerk?

255
00:10:39.857 --> 00:10:43.062
<v ->Because it provides us with a strong sense</v>

256
00:10:43.062 --> 00:10:46.138
of ourselves, that's why.

257
00:10:46.138 --> 00:10:48.065
It defines me.

258
00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:50.271
The problem is that I'm being defined

259
00:10:50.271 --> 00:10:53.139
by something that secretly confines me

260
00:10:53.139 --> 00:10:55.577
because I'm limited to knowing myself

261
00:10:55.577 --> 00:10:57.841
through something outside of myself,

262
00:10:57.841 --> 00:11:00.151
so that the root of it is separation

263
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:02.822
which ultimately means suffering.

264
00:11:02.822 --> 00:11:04.923
'Cause what we're looking for is love,

265
00:11:04.923 --> 00:11:07.326
we're looking for a kind of wholeness.

266
00:11:07.326 --> 00:11:09.823
And that's natural to us; we can't escape that.

267
00:11:09.823 --> 00:11:11.657
It's in our hard drive.

268
00:11:11.657 --> 00:11:14.060
Einstein said, "The central urge of every atom

269
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.651
"is to return to its source."

270
00:11:15.651 --> 00:11:17.675
We're no different than that.

271
00:11:17.675 --> 00:11:20.063
So the path of becoming doesn't work,

272
00:11:20.063 --> 00:11:24.194
and it takes long time to start realizing,

273
00:11:26.204 --> 00:11:28.868
I'm right back where I started from,

274
00:11:28.868 --> 00:11:32.284
only now I'm 90.
(both laugh)

275
00:11:33.674 --> 00:11:35.950
Whereas the road, the real road,

276
00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:37.552
is this path of understanding that

277
00:11:37.552 --> 00:11:39.990
there's nothing to be achieved.

278
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.057
And that's a difficult one for us,

279
00:11:42.057 --> 00:11:43.984
Western and Eastern minds alike,

280
00:11:43.984 --> 00:11:46.597
even though we may have words to talk about it,

281
00:11:46.597 --> 00:11:48.884
even seem illumined.

282
00:11:48.884 --> 00:11:50.196
The fact of the matter is that

283
00:11:50.196 --> 00:11:54.513
the mind is really basically driven by desire,

284
00:11:54.875 --> 00:11:57.011
and desire always seeks an object

285
00:11:57.011 --> 00:12:00.273
through which to fulfill itself.

286
00:12:00.273 --> 00:12:04.650
That divided mind isn't comfortable unless it's in movement,

287
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.611
thought being its principal architect.

288
00:12:07.611 --> 00:12:09.677
So it's seeking, seeking, seeking,

289
00:12:09.677 --> 00:12:11.256
then you tell that mind, "Look.

290
00:12:11.256 --> 00:12:12.974
"Can you look closely enough to see that

291
00:12:12.974 --> 00:12:15.087
"you've been seeking all of this time,

292
00:12:15.087 --> 00:12:17.189
"and that all you find is the next thing

293
00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:18.681
"that you have to go look for?"

294
00:12:19.089 --> 00:12:20.563
'Cause if you're willing to see that,

295
00:12:20.563 --> 00:12:22.176
there's evidence that indicates

296
00:12:22.176 --> 00:12:26.334
that we need not be seekers of things outside of ourselves,

297
00:12:26.334 --> 00:12:28.957
but rather can learn to attend to ourselves

298
00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:31.512
as we are in the present moment.

299
00:12:31.512 --> 00:12:34.036
And it is in this new kind of attention

300
00:12:35.216 --> 00:12:39.585
that this rift that is present starts to close.

301
00:12:39.585 --> 00:12:41.687
And then we find out that we needn't be afraid

302
00:12:41.687 --> 00:12:44.183
of what we are, of what's passing through us,

303
00:12:44.183 --> 00:12:47.874
of what's touching us because everything that takes place

304
00:12:47.874 --> 00:12:49.738
takes place for the purpose

305
00:12:49.738 --> 00:12:53.053
of revealing ourselves to ourselves.

306
00:12:53.053 --> 00:12:55.118
And when you understand that

307
00:12:55.118 --> 00:12:58.266
there's no such thing as a bad revelation--

308
00:12:58.266 --> 00:13:01.006
You know, people talk about their bad, this bad--

309
00:13:01.006 --> 00:13:03.038
there's no bad truth.

310
00:13:03.038 --> 00:13:05.302
Anything that reveals something

311
00:13:05.302 --> 00:13:09.005
is revealing it to something that needs the revelation.

312
00:13:09.005 --> 00:13:12.418
It's an opening, so that constant revelation

313
00:13:12.418 --> 00:13:15.576
then becomes one's reality, and

314
00:13:15.576 --> 00:13:18.119
because the revelation is a transformation,

315
00:13:18.119 --> 00:13:19.652
here I am, I take myself to be

316
00:13:19.652 --> 00:13:21.980
a certain kind of human being.

317
00:13:22.947 --> 00:13:24.830
Then something happens, and suddenly

318
00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.007
I see I'm nervous or I'm anxious.

319
00:13:27.798 --> 00:13:30.398
Ordinarily, the way we hide our nervousness or anxiety

320
00:13:30.398 --> 00:13:34.102
is by speeding up, saying things we don't know.

321
00:13:34.102 --> 00:13:37.109
But let's say that you've done that 437,000 times

322
00:13:37.109 --> 00:13:38.200
and you don't want to do it anymore,

323
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.511
so now I'm left, and what it's showing me

324
00:13:40.511 --> 00:13:43.715
is that the problem isn't what I'm facing,

325
00:13:43.715 --> 00:13:46.316
it's that the self that's facing it

326
00:13:46.316 --> 00:13:49.863
doesn't understand what the moment is for.

327
00:13:50.844 --> 00:13:52.423
And the moment is for--I say that

328
00:13:52.423 --> 00:13:55.453
lessons ride in on the back of events.

329
00:13:56.113 --> 00:14:00.283
The moment is for this order of myself

330
00:14:00.283 --> 00:14:04.195
to be revealed to myself so that I can let go

331
00:14:04.195 --> 00:14:07.597
of who and what I had been in order that something

332
00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:11.227
altogether new can come in and take its place.

333
00:14:11.227 --> 00:14:12.625
<v Regina>Literally you have to make space</v>

334
00:14:12.625 --> 00:14:14.291
for that in your own head.

335
00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:16.316
<v ->Literally; it's the discovery</v>

336
00:14:16.316 --> 00:14:18.742
that the confinement and the clutter

337
00:14:18.742 --> 00:14:21.482
in the occupied mind, they're all this thing

338
00:14:21.482 --> 00:14:22.671
that doesn't work.

339
00:14:22.671 --> 00:14:24.883
So it isn't so much an ambition,

340
00:14:24.883 --> 00:14:26.520
although people do it for a long time,

341
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.285
they set out to become spiritual.

342
00:14:28.285 --> 00:14:29.388
I did it myself, you know.

343
00:14:29.388 --> 00:14:30.955
You have a longing to be spiritual,

344
00:14:30.955 --> 00:14:32.894
and God sees that in a person,

345
00:14:32.894 --> 00:14:35.135
to seek the truth of themselves.

346
00:14:35.135 --> 00:14:36.563
But after a while you start recognizing

347
00:14:36.563 --> 00:14:38.165
that for me to look anywhere other

348
00:14:38.165 --> 00:14:40.708
than where I am right now, for anything,

349
00:14:40.708 --> 00:14:42.774
is a waste of time.

350
00:14:42.774 --> 00:14:44.771
Then we're left with ourselves,

351
00:14:44.771 --> 00:14:46.547
which is where we need to be

352
00:14:46.547 --> 00:14:49.009
because the journey ends where it begins.

353
00:14:49.009 --> 00:14:51.041
<v Regina>Is it that a lot of people might be afraid</v>

354
00:14:51.041 --> 00:14:53.316
to end up at exactly that spot,

355
00:14:53.316 --> 00:14:54.976
sitting there with themselves?

356
00:14:54.976 --> 00:14:57.217
<v ->We don't know what to do with our pain, Regina.</v>

357
00:14:57.217 --> 00:14:58.738
We do not understand the nature

358
00:14:58.738 --> 00:15:01.257
of our psychological pain, that's a fact.

359
00:15:01.257 --> 00:15:02.743
<v Regina>So we cover it up with addictions</v>

360
00:15:02.743 --> 00:15:04.450
and attachments of every single kind.

361
00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:06.493
<v ->That's exactly right, that's exactly right.</v>

362
00:15:06.493 --> 00:15:08.258
And particularly Western culture.

363
00:15:08.258 --> 00:15:11.764
We are conditioned to console ourselves every moment.

364
00:15:11.764 --> 00:15:13.401
And if there's something wrong,

365
00:15:13.401 --> 00:15:15.108
if there's a disturbance of any kind,

366
00:15:15.108 --> 00:15:18.243
eat something, talk to somebody, get a shrink,

367
00:15:18.243 --> 00:15:21.877
take a drug, so that the disturbance,

368
00:15:21.877 --> 00:15:25.561
which is principal--imagine here's a clam,

369
00:15:25.561 --> 00:15:28.476
and a grain of sand sneaks in, you know,

370
00:15:28.476 --> 00:15:29.936
and the clam goes, "Oh, what's that?

371
00:15:29.936 --> 00:15:31.316
"I don't that sand in there."

372
00:15:31.316 --> 00:15:32.651
We'd have no pearls.
<v Regina>Pearls.</v>

373
00:15:32.651 --> 00:15:33.707
That's true.
<v ->Exactly.</v>

374
00:15:33.707 --> 00:15:34.857
No more pearls!

375
00:15:34.857 --> 00:15:36.215
Well that's just what we are.

376
00:15:36.215 --> 00:15:40.197
Life is meant to create this natural disturbance.

377
00:15:40.197 --> 00:15:43.970
The impression of life comes, and it touches us,

378
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.271
touches, touch touch touch.

379
00:15:45.271 --> 00:15:47.500
And when it touches, if it's not a recognizable touch,

380
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.404
I don't want it.

381
00:15:49.404 --> 00:15:52.608
But every last touch is a revelation

382
00:15:52.608 --> 00:15:55.348
because it is showing me something about myself,

383
00:15:55.348 --> 00:15:56.614
and this is really beautiful,

384
00:15:56.614 --> 00:15:58.878
that not only did I not know was there,

385
00:15:58.878 --> 00:16:02.523
but when I will be aware and awake to it,

386
00:16:02.523 --> 00:16:05.251
I discover it has always been there,

387
00:16:05.251 --> 00:16:08.885
and it is not a problem in itself.

388
00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:12.071
This part of us that resists life,

389
00:16:12.501 --> 00:16:16.095
it actually looks at what it is resisting

390
00:16:16.095 --> 00:16:19.300
as being the problem, instead of understanding

391
00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.572
that resistance exists for the purpose of revelation.

392
00:16:23.572 --> 00:16:26.103
That's why resistance exists.

393
00:16:26.103 --> 00:16:28.777
When you put two hands together,

394
00:16:28.777 --> 00:16:30.348
there's resistance, and suddenly

395
00:16:30.348 --> 00:16:31.676
there's awareness of two hands.

396
00:16:31.676 --> 00:16:35.019
So when life touches us and it stirs us,

397
00:16:35.019 --> 00:16:36.471
we have something in us that comes in

398
00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:40.221
and it wants to deflect this touch.

399
00:16:40.221 --> 00:16:42.845
When you start understanding that the Divine,

400
00:16:42.845 --> 00:16:47.500
the only way in which it can reveal its presence to you,

401
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:52.411
in your presence, is by touching you and showing you this,

402
00:16:52.411 --> 00:16:55.674
then you begin to go, "Take me, I'm yours."

403
00:16:55.674 --> 00:16:56.672
<v Regina>Right; show me!</v>

404
00:16:56.672 --> 00:16:58.611
<v ->Show me, show me.</v>

405
00:16:58.611 --> 00:17:00.178
<v Regina>Now maybe this is a flip-side</v>

406
00:17:00.178 --> 00:17:02.557
of saying the same thing, but it seems what happens

407
00:17:02.557 --> 00:17:05.263
is when we go through our infancy

408
00:17:05.263 --> 00:17:06.800
and then into childhood,

409
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.513
for many people, it's a time of exploration,

410
00:17:09.513 --> 00:17:11.092
we're open to a lot of different things,

411
00:17:11.092 --> 00:17:12.682
we want to know a lot, we're curious.

412
00:17:12.682 --> 00:17:15.682
And as we continue through life, our preferences

413
00:17:15.682 --> 00:17:19.161
become stronger and stronger, which seems to me

414
00:17:19.161 --> 00:17:23.096
at that point, our openness to life becomes

415
00:17:23.096 --> 00:17:25.929
narrower and narrower, and it's almost as though

416
00:17:25.929 --> 00:17:28.912
anything that brushes up against those preferences...

417
00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:32.912
It can be simple, it can be something very simple.

418
00:17:32.912 --> 00:17:34.839
I think you gave a couple examples today,

419
00:17:34.839 --> 00:17:36.012
as a matter of fact.
<v ->That's accurate.</v>

420
00:17:36.012 --> 00:17:37.649
<v Regina>When it doesn't meet your preferences,</v>

421
00:17:37.649 --> 00:17:40.447
now suddenly it creates huge amount of resistance.

422
00:17:40.447 --> 00:17:42.479
So are preferences in and of themselves

423
00:17:42.479 --> 00:17:45.346
really not doing us much service?

424
00:17:45.346 --> 00:17:48.249
<v ->There's nothing wrong with natural preference.</v>

425
00:17:48.249 --> 00:17:50.490
But when preference becomes pain,

426
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.760
<v Regina>When we're attached, hard fast.</v>

427
00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:55.593
<v ->Little by little, we become easily</v>

428
00:17:55.593 --> 00:17:57.562
conditioned to certain things.

429
00:17:57.562 --> 00:17:59.164
I don't know if you were ever driving along,

430
00:17:59.164 --> 00:18:02.706
they had, The Beatles were on Larry King last night.

431
00:18:02.706 --> 00:18:04.238
And I'm sitting there going, "God, I know every

432
00:18:04.238 --> 00:18:07.605
"Beatles song, I can sing them, every last one of them."

433
00:18:07.605 --> 00:18:09.613
It's like I'm a, it's a hard drive,

434
00:18:09.613 --> 00:18:12.017
like I'm an iPod up here!

435
00:18:12.017 --> 00:18:15.268
And there's nothing wrong with singing that music,

436
00:18:15.268 --> 00:18:17.381
but if you watch yourself while you sing,

437
00:18:17.381 --> 00:18:20.457
you are experiencing the exact same pleasure you did

438
00:18:20.457 --> 00:18:23.127
when you were 19 years old.

439
00:18:23.127 --> 00:18:25.252
And that's the pleasure, it's not in the singing.

440
00:18:25.252 --> 00:18:28.364
It's in the re-visitation of what you were.

441
00:18:28.364 --> 00:18:30.895
And that's what preferences are,

442
00:18:30.895 --> 00:18:33.170
is this sort of discovery that

443
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:34.470
over and over again doing something

444
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.710
that gives me pleasure, I find my sense of self in it.

445
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:39.207
Monkey with my preference?

446
00:18:39.207 --> 00:18:42.539
You're monkeying with my life, and you're in danger.

447
00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:44.281
That's why these preferences have

448
00:18:44.281 --> 00:18:46.115
the power over us that they do.

449
00:18:46.115 --> 00:18:49.215
<v Regina>This starts winding into the notion</v>

450
00:18:49.215 --> 00:18:50.585
of the art of letting go.

451
00:18:50.585 --> 00:18:52.807
You wrote a book, The Secret of Letting Go.

452
00:18:52.807 --> 00:18:55.891
And you said something earlier today,

453
00:18:55.891 --> 00:18:57.423
and that means letting go of a lot of things,

454
00:18:57.423 --> 00:18:59.989
and you said a sentence I thought was quite interesting.

455
00:18:59.989 --> 00:19:03.960
And it seems to be for both men and women, and that is,

456
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.907
"Aging is intended to bring beauty to the soul."

457
00:19:07.907 --> 00:19:11.007
So what is it in, just taking that one example,

458
00:19:11.007 --> 00:19:14.815
that we resist, what are we refusing to let go of

459
00:19:14.815 --> 00:19:18.705
by refusing to let go of youth as one example?

460
00:19:19.655 --> 00:19:23.586
<v ->We think we are our face, our body,</v>

461
00:19:24.266 --> 00:19:28.253
and our self-worth is deeply wrapped into

462
00:19:28.253 --> 00:19:31.713
how people estimate us through what we think

463
00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:34.128
they're thinking about our appearance.

464
00:19:34.128 --> 00:19:37.758
So as we start to age and our natural vigor passes,

465
00:19:37.767 --> 00:19:42.735
our body loses its tone, there is a horrible part

466
00:19:42.735 --> 00:19:46.264
of our consciousness that begins to denigrate us

467
00:19:46.264 --> 00:19:50.049
for no longer being an instrument of beauty.

468
00:19:50.049 --> 00:19:53.433
When I said that aging is meant to bring beauty to the soul,

469
00:19:53.433 --> 00:19:55.889
to clarify that further, is that

470
00:19:55.889 --> 00:19:58.813
we're meant all the time, Regina,

471
00:19:58.813 --> 00:20:01.492
to be in relationship with beauty.

472
00:20:01.492 --> 00:20:03.354
There's two models to me:

473
00:20:03.354 --> 00:20:05.525
there's the one we live from with our divided mind,

474
00:20:05.525 --> 00:20:07.534
which is the possession model.

475
00:20:07.534 --> 00:20:10.727
I possess my body, I possess my friends, my family.

476
00:20:10.727 --> 00:20:12.503
And we may not think that we possess it,

477
00:20:12.503 --> 00:20:14.198
but let something monkey with it,

478
00:20:14.198 --> 00:20:17.077
and you'll see yourself clinging to it.

479
00:20:17.077 --> 00:20:19.539
So, the possession model, which is the divided mind.

480
00:20:19.539 --> 00:20:23.381
The participation model is a different story.

481
00:20:23.381 --> 00:20:27.015
I think we're led by the pain of possession

482
00:20:27.015 --> 00:20:29.581
to begin to want to participate in life.

483
00:20:29.581 --> 00:20:31.857
And participation is a different relationship.

484
00:20:31.857 --> 00:20:33.517
For instance, with beauty, when you look

485
00:20:33.517 --> 00:20:36.547
at something beautiful, the reason you love

486
00:20:36.547 --> 00:20:40.355
looking at it is because it is reminding you

487
00:20:40.355 --> 00:20:43.769
of something that you already are.

488
00:20:43.769 --> 00:20:45.162
<v Regina>Or you wouldn't be able to recognize</v>

489
00:20:45.162 --> 00:20:47.186
beauty.
<v ->Or you wouldn't know it.</v>

490
00:20:47.186 --> 00:20:50.804
This beautiful, eternal quality

491
00:20:50.804 --> 00:20:52.975
is mirrored for a split-second.

492
00:20:52.975 --> 00:20:55.111
I look out, I see this extraordinary sky,

493
00:20:55.111 --> 00:20:58.084
and I am brought into it, separation ends.

494
00:20:58.084 --> 00:20:59.779
There's just beauty.

495
00:20:59.779 --> 00:21:03.088
Just as the eyes reflect the physical beauty,

496
00:21:03.088 --> 00:21:06.814
the soul is intended to reflect this eternal beauty

497
00:21:06.814 --> 00:21:10.425
of God's life, and it's when an individual begins to let go

498
00:21:10.425 --> 00:21:12.526
and let go of this possession idea

499
00:21:12.526 --> 00:21:15.731
and participate more and more fully in the present moment,

500
00:21:15.731 --> 00:21:17.391
in which there's always beauty

501
00:21:17.391 --> 00:21:20.340
because there's always creation taking place.

502
00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.327
<v Regina>Right.</v>

503
00:21:21.327 --> 00:21:26.327
<v ->Then, my satisfaction is in participation.</v>

504
00:21:26.447 --> 00:21:29.407
I don't need things anymore.

505
00:21:29.407 --> 00:21:30.711
<v Regina>And then you also don't need</v>

506
00:21:30.711 --> 00:21:34.494
to go that next step, which is to look to a time when.

507
00:21:34.494 --> 00:21:36.179
<v ->Becoming ends.</v>

508
00:21:36.859 --> 00:21:40.518
Time actually ends because love, compassion,

509
00:21:40.518 --> 00:21:43.428
beauty, kindness, these are qualities

510
00:21:43.428 --> 00:21:46.623
that we did not create, but that we are created

511
00:21:46.623 --> 00:21:49.688
to be able to be a participant in.

512
00:21:49.688 --> 00:21:52.076
Through which, to not only know

513
00:21:52.076 --> 00:21:54.816
the beauty of this life, but to realize,

514
00:21:54.816 --> 00:21:59.103
"My god, I am the ground of this thing."

515
00:21:59.103 --> 00:22:00.775
Not in a self-centered way.

516
00:22:00.775 --> 00:22:03.771
I think it's a danger with present New Age thinking,

517
00:22:03.771 --> 00:22:06.116
you know, "I'm God," god help you.

518
00:22:06.116 --> 00:22:10.017
And yet, this Divine is our nature,

519
00:22:10.017 --> 00:22:12.420
and we are intended to share in that life

520
00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.893
if we'll simply recognize how little

521
00:22:14.893 --> 00:22:17.656
we have given ourselves trying to possess

522
00:22:17.656 --> 00:22:20.344
the things that can't be possessed in the first place.

523
00:22:20.466 --> 00:22:23.693
<v Regina>And this feeds also into our judgments.</v>

524
00:22:23.693 --> 00:22:25.435
I mean, you gave an example of

525
00:22:25.435 --> 00:22:27.536
we look around at the state of the world,

526
00:22:27.536 --> 00:22:29.765
the state of the economy, and the United States

527
00:22:29.765 --> 00:22:31.507
in particular right now.

528
00:22:31.507 --> 00:22:35.454
The state of affairs appears to be a bit dismal,

529
00:22:35.454 --> 00:22:37.614
on many levels; yet at the same time then,

530
00:22:37.614 --> 00:22:41.718
we start maybe placing blame on various entities

531
00:22:41.718 --> 00:22:45.091
or whatnot as to why we are the way we are.

532
00:22:45.091 --> 00:22:48.456
But you say in the end, everything is just a mirror.

533
00:22:48.456 --> 00:22:50.130
So let's talk about that because

534
00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:51.627
a lot of people watching this,

535
00:22:51.627 --> 00:22:54.332
certainly, I think, a lot of Americans watching this,

536
00:22:54.332 --> 00:22:57.026
are probably feeling some of these feelings

537
00:22:57.026 --> 00:22:59.626
of judgment and despair and frustration right now.

538
00:22:59.626 --> 00:23:02.865
What's that reflect back to us?

539
00:23:02.865 --> 00:23:04.874
<v ->I would say it this way,</v>

540
00:23:04.874 --> 00:23:07.103
this is what I found, and I believe

541
00:23:07.103 --> 00:23:10.296
that it's true across the board.

542
00:23:10.296 --> 00:23:14.951
You and I, we can't suffer without having taken

543
00:23:14.951 --> 00:23:19.951
the temporary to be the eternal, it's impossible.

544
00:23:22.407 --> 00:23:27.091
I think in the mercy of this divine life, in its justice,

545
00:23:27.091 --> 00:23:29.056
it's always basically saying,

546
00:23:29.056 --> 00:23:31.967
"Come here, you've got something I want."

547
00:23:31.967 --> 00:23:34.661
And you go, "No, not that.

548
00:23:34.661 --> 00:23:37.807
"Not that, let me keep my hair."

549
00:23:37.807 --> 00:23:40.871
(both laugh)

550
00:23:41.901 --> 00:23:43.650
<v Regina>You negotiate.</v>

551
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:47.832
<v ->"Just don't take that from me."</v>

552
00:23:49.382 --> 00:23:51.823
And what I've found to be true

553
00:23:51.823 --> 00:23:55.070
is that the root of the fearless life

554
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.489
is the discovery that God never takes anything

555
00:23:57.489 --> 00:24:01.599
from a human being with which it isn't replaced

556
00:24:01.599 --> 00:24:03.468
with something greater than what's taken

557
00:24:03.468 --> 00:24:06.887
if I will give it up.

558
00:24:07.195 --> 00:24:08.765
<v Regina>That's the key, and this is</v>

559
00:24:08.765 --> 00:24:11.641
the letting go part, the secrets of letting go.

560
00:24:11.641 --> 00:24:13.812
Can you just talk about that a little more?

561
00:24:13.812 --> 00:24:15.844
Most people have a problem with letting go

562
00:24:15.844 --> 00:24:17.237
of the things
<v ->Oh, we all do.</v>

563
00:24:17.237 --> 00:24:18.747
<v Regina>that we love.</v>

564
00:24:20.377 --> 00:24:23.750
<v ->When we understand that our nature knows itself</v>

565
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:26.687
by what it is identified with, then we can

566
00:24:26.687 --> 00:24:28.893
start to understand that I don't have to sitting here

567
00:24:28.893 --> 00:24:31.795
and holding something in my hand to be attached to it.

568
00:24:31.795 --> 00:24:36.265
Anything that I'm identified with, I'm attached to.

569
00:24:36.265 --> 00:24:40.839
And if I'm attached to something, I'm afraid of it changing.

570
00:24:40.839 --> 00:24:44.334
So when we talk about the end of this identification,

571
00:24:44.334 --> 00:24:48.014
letting go, it's all set up to help us do that, Regina.

572
00:24:48.014 --> 00:24:50.975
Only when the pain comes, I don't recognize it

573
00:24:50.975 --> 00:24:53.361
as an invitation.

574
00:24:53.381 --> 00:24:55.488
The disturbance comes, I don't look at it as

575
00:24:55.488 --> 00:24:58.916
something saying to me, "Guy, I want to give you

576
00:24:58.916 --> 00:25:00.611
"something better than what you have.

577
00:25:00.611 --> 00:25:02.974
"You're worried about this, you're gonna go.

578
00:25:02.974 --> 00:25:05.499
"I'd like to give you something better than worry.

579
00:25:05.499 --> 00:25:07.247
"Do you want it?"

580
00:25:07.461 --> 00:25:10.189
And I go, "Well, okay, I'd like it."

581
00:25:10.189 --> 00:25:14.851
And it says, "Okay, first let go of the worry.

582
00:25:15.054 --> 00:25:17.754
"Then I'll show you something better."

583
00:25:18.502 --> 00:25:21.950
Our mind is, "No, first give me something better.

584
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:23.645
"Then I'll let go."
<v Regina>Then I'll let go.</v>

585
00:25:23.645 --> 00:25:25.236
It doesn't work that way.

586
00:25:25.236 --> 00:25:26.501
<v ->It doesn't work that way.
<v Regina>Can you give</v>

587
00:25:26.501 --> 00:25:29.578
a couple of anecdotes of situations

588
00:25:29.578 --> 00:25:31.018
you've experienced in your life where,

589
00:25:31.018 --> 00:25:33.015
maybe you were trying to do that exact thing,

590
00:25:33.015 --> 00:25:35.627
hold on, or maybe you were graciously saying,

591
00:25:35.627 --> 00:25:36.950
"Okay, I'll give it up!"

592
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:38.727
and something better rushed in,

593
00:25:38.727 --> 00:25:41.124
or someone else's experience that you find interesting?

594
00:25:41.124 --> 00:25:45.060
<v ->You know what, Regina, I think that</v>

595
00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.128
if the people watching us, if they look at

596
00:25:48.128 --> 00:25:49.564
their own life
<v Regina>We're doing it</v>

597
00:25:49.564 --> 00:25:50.934
all the time, yeah.
<v ->All the time.</v>

598
00:25:50.934 --> 00:25:55.335
I mean, when we examine our day-to-day activities,

599
00:25:55.335 --> 00:25:57.749
there are all of these instances

600
00:25:57.749 --> 00:26:02.720
in which we find ourselves ragged, stressed, worried.

601
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:06.724
And we're in that position because something

602
00:26:06.724 --> 00:26:09.127
is trying to hold onto something

603
00:26:09.127 --> 00:26:10.985
that it thinks is valuable.

604
00:26:10.985 --> 00:26:15.191
Life says, "I think you have to let this go."

605
00:26:15.191 --> 00:26:16.999
You go, "No!"

606
00:26:16.999 --> 00:26:19.890
It goes, "Okay, suffer."

607
00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:22.467
You go, "Okay, I'll suffer, 'cause I know better."

608
00:26:22.467 --> 00:26:23.535
Then we go through that,

609
00:26:23.535 --> 00:26:24.801
and finally, lesson comes back.

610
00:26:24.801 --> 00:26:28.469
One day you say, "Alright, I'm gonna let this go."

611
00:26:28.469 --> 00:26:31.175
And the thing that's extraordinary is that

612
00:26:31.175 --> 00:26:33.364
what you get in exchange

613
00:26:33.364 --> 00:26:36.674
is not another possession.

614
00:26:36.674 --> 00:26:40.788
What you get is possession of yourself.

615
00:26:40.788 --> 00:26:43.156
Because any time an individual exists

616
00:26:43.156 --> 00:26:46.024
as someone who must have something,

617
00:26:46.024 --> 00:26:50.470
this divided state is the root of our unhappiness.

618
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:52.165
So when we're really letting go,

619
00:26:52.165 --> 00:26:56.670
what's taking place is the integration of a self

620
00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:58.539
that thought it had to have something

621
00:26:58.539 --> 00:27:00.524
in order to be something.

622
00:27:01.344 --> 00:27:04.850
So letting go is this marvelous instance in which,

623
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:07.516
believe it or not, parts of us don't want to be whole,

624
00:27:07.516 --> 00:27:08.747
and you asked me why:

625
00:27:08.747 --> 00:27:11.881
because in being whole, there's no tomorrow,

626
00:27:11.881 --> 00:27:13.251
there's no worry, there's no--

627
00:27:13.251 --> 00:27:13.983
<v Regina>There's no drama.</v>

628
00:27:13.983 --> 00:27:15.515
<v ->There's no drama, the way we know it.</v>

629
00:27:15.515 --> 00:27:16.583
But I wanna tell you something.

630
00:27:16.583 --> 00:27:19.590
You can't imagine how dramatic the present moment is.

631
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:20.995
There's nothing more dramatic.

632
00:27:20.995 --> 00:27:21.866
It's extraordinary!

633
00:27:21.866 --> 00:27:22.899
<v Regina>If we were paying attention!</v>

634
00:27:22.899 --> 00:27:24.990
<v ->If you were paying attention.</v>

635
00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.439
<v Regina>You have a new book now,</v>

636
00:27:28.439 --> 00:27:30.970
The Essential Laws of Fearless Living,

637
00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:32.746
so letting go of fear seems to be

638
00:27:32.746 --> 00:27:34.941
the number one thing we have to let go of.

639
00:27:34.941 --> 00:27:37.181
As you were saying, and as we've all experienced,

640
00:27:37.181 --> 00:27:41.187
oftentimes, in our attempt to have or to hold

641
00:27:41.187 --> 00:27:43.950
and feel whole, we'll hang on to something known,

642
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:45.157
even if it's not good for us versus

643
00:27:45.157 --> 00:27:47.688
going into the unknown and letting go.

644
00:27:47.688 --> 00:27:50.753
Can you give us some of the, a little tease of

645
00:27:50.753 --> 00:27:53.686
some of the tenets in this Fearless Living book?

646
00:27:54.066 --> 00:27:56.891
<v ->It begins with ruthless self-honesty</v>

647
00:27:56.891 --> 00:28:00.374
because we're not really letting go of things,

648
00:28:00.374 --> 00:28:03.810
we are discovering the inherent limitation

649
00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:08.020
in being identified with things for a sense of ourselves.

650
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:13.164
We have to start with receptivity.

651
00:28:13.684 --> 00:28:15.745
In this moment, wherever we are,

652
00:28:15.745 --> 00:28:17.754
whoever we are, whatever we're doing,

653
00:28:17.754 --> 00:28:22.258
we are in a dynamic relationship with life

654
00:28:22.258 --> 00:28:24.488
that most of us have no awareness of at all

655
00:28:24.488 --> 00:28:28.400
because we're too busy thinking about our lives.

656
00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.128
The thought life cannot bring about

657
00:28:31.128 --> 00:28:33.462
the contentment it promises.

658
00:28:33.462 --> 00:28:36.933
The only way to discover that is to finally see for a fact,

659
00:28:36.933 --> 00:28:38.826
"You know, how many times have I tried

660
00:28:38.826 --> 00:28:41.345
"to think my way into fulfillment."

661
00:28:41.345 --> 00:28:42.820
Doesn't take place.

662
00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:45.211
This receptivity means I begin to want

663
00:28:45.211 --> 00:28:47.558
to be present in myself more than

664
00:28:47.558 --> 00:28:51.481
I want to give myself presence, in a manner of speaking.

665
00:28:51.481 --> 00:28:53.385
And out of that receptivity,

666
00:28:53.385 --> 00:28:57.965
something new takes place, which is an essential--

667
00:28:59.145 --> 00:29:02.051
I call it recognition and actualization

668
00:29:02.051 --> 00:29:04.367
because I start to see, you know,

669
00:29:04.367 --> 00:29:07.235
there's something in me that's really nervous,

670
00:29:07.235 --> 00:29:08.907
or there's really angry or it's anxious,

671
00:29:08.907 --> 00:29:10.428
you wanted anecdotes.

672
00:29:10.428 --> 00:29:14.180
How often is a person anxious about tomorrow?

673
00:29:15.641 --> 00:29:17.708
The anxiousness promises that

674
00:29:17.708 --> 00:29:20.552
if we do what it tells us to do,

675
00:29:20.552 --> 00:29:23.954
that we will be liberated from our anxiety.

676
00:29:23.954 --> 00:29:27.959
We become the instrument of the will of that desire

677
00:29:27.959 --> 00:29:31.222
that serves itself, but we don't know it.

678
00:29:31.222 --> 00:29:33.091
One day, a man or a woman's feeling anxious,

679
00:29:33.091 --> 00:29:34.298
they realize, you know, "I've been answering

680
00:29:34.298 --> 00:29:36.736
"this anxiety the same way for 50 years."

681
00:29:36.736 --> 00:29:37.596
<v Regina>The loops.</v>

682
00:29:37.596 --> 00:29:42.031
<v ->"I wonder what would happen if I didn't answer this way."</v>

683
00:29:42.031 --> 00:29:45.502
Then the person begins to meet for the first time,

684
00:29:45.502 --> 00:29:48.478
not the condition they blame their anxiety on,

685
00:29:48.478 --> 00:29:52.379
or look to resolve it, but they start to see

686
00:29:52.379 --> 00:29:55.711
there's something in me that's producing this.

687
00:29:55.711 --> 00:29:59.856
Now, if I'm honest, I don't know what to do about this.

688
00:29:59.856 --> 00:30:03.578
The truth is, human beings do not--we touched that--

689
00:30:03.578 --> 00:30:05.591
we do not know what to do with our pain.

690
00:30:05.591 --> 00:30:06.926
And there's a good reason why

691
00:30:06.926 --> 00:30:08.598
we don't know what to do with our pain.

692
00:30:08.598 --> 00:30:11.553
It's not our responsibility.

693
00:30:11.768 --> 00:30:14.171
It isn't our responsibility, Regina.

694
00:30:14.171 --> 00:30:18.025
My responsibility is to be conscious of my state.

695
00:30:18.025 --> 00:30:19.674
If I'm anxious, my responsibility is

696
00:30:19.674 --> 00:30:23.923
to bring the light of awareness into that state of darkness.

697
00:30:23.923 --> 00:30:26.547
That darkness is an unregenerate form,

698
00:30:26.547 --> 00:30:29.136
no matter what it is, not negative, not moral,

699
00:30:29.136 --> 00:30:33.118
just an unconscious form of energy.

700
00:30:33.118 --> 00:30:37.112
And it comes in, my conditioned mind grabs it,

701
00:30:37.112 --> 00:30:40.932
it names it, it tells me what to do with this energy,

702
00:30:40.932 --> 00:30:44.403
and this energy that is the font of creation itself

703
00:30:44.403 --> 00:30:48.293
is not transformed; instead it's turned into a will

704
00:30:48.293 --> 00:30:50.696
that drives me from pillar to post serving it,

705
00:30:50.696 --> 00:30:54.040
so that not only does it not change, but I don't change.

706
00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.304
But if I recognize the futility of that,

707
00:30:56.304 --> 00:30:58.672
and I start to want to be present to myself,

708
00:30:58.672 --> 00:31:00.344
here comes this anxiety or this fear,

709
00:31:00.344 --> 00:31:04.756
this dark energy, and it's met with this light of awareness.

710
00:31:04.756 --> 00:31:08.418
And this active light enters into this passive darkness,

711
00:31:08.418 --> 00:31:11.166
and the darkness is changed.

712
00:31:11.166 --> 00:31:13.822
That energy itself is transformed,

713
00:31:13.822 --> 00:31:15.866
and because it's transformed,

714
00:31:15.866 --> 00:31:18.699
I have a transformational experience

715
00:31:18.699 --> 00:31:20.626
'cause now I'm no longer the instrument

716
00:31:20.626 --> 00:31:23.563
of the darkness that drove me to do what it wanted;

717
00:31:23.563 --> 00:31:26.663
rather, now, I'm the instrument of this light,

718
00:31:26.663 --> 00:31:29.775
using a word, that has begun to do what

719
00:31:29.775 --> 00:31:31.783
alone can fulfill me, which is

720
00:31:31.783 --> 00:31:35.522
make me a participant in creation.

721
00:31:35.522 --> 00:31:36.752
<v Regina>Well, I see why people say</v>

722
00:31:36.752 --> 00:31:38.269
you're a sparkle of light.

723
00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:39.959
(both laugh)

724
00:31:39.959 --> 00:31:41.851
You've worked on it!
<v ->Do you see?</v>

725
00:31:41.851 --> 00:31:43.209
It's so beautiful.
<v Regina>Yeah</v>

726
00:31:43.209 --> 00:31:43.952
it's beautiful.

727
00:31:43.952 --> 00:31:46.890
<v ->Because it really does, it answers everything.</v>

728
00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:48.898
It answers everything.

729
00:31:48.898 --> 00:31:50.535
<v Regina>We just have to be still in it.</v>

730
00:31:50.535 --> 00:31:52.672
<v ->We have to be still in it, and we have to get tired.</v>

731
00:31:52.672 --> 00:31:54.013
You know, people say, "How do you do it?"

732
00:31:54.013 --> 00:31:55.864
Just get tired of being you.

733
00:31:55.864 --> 00:31:57.931
<v Regina>Tired of the stories.</v>

734
00:31:57.931 --> 00:31:59.510
<v ->Tired of the story, yeah.</v>

735
00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:01.460
And out of that if we won't rewrite,

736
00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:04.316
if we won't pick up the pen and write another chapter,

737
00:32:04.316 --> 00:32:06.348
starring moi--c'est moi--

738
00:32:06.348 --> 00:32:11.015
then a new understanding of yourself will be born.

739
00:32:11.015 --> 00:32:14.106
Don't rush it, don't be impatient, that's another thing.

740
00:32:14.106 --> 00:32:17.332
I'm the most impatient man that every lived.

741
00:32:17.332 --> 00:32:19.284
My hallmark on my grave, it'll say,

742
00:32:19.284 --> 00:32:21.061
"He was in a hurry get here."

743
00:32:21.061 --> 00:32:22.800
(both laugh)

744
00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:26.276
Because we have a hunger for life, we do,

745
00:32:26.276 --> 00:32:28.260
a natural hunger for life, but there's only one thing

746
00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:29.537
that can answer it:

747
00:32:29.537 --> 00:32:31.430
it's these conscious impressions

748
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:35.377
transforming ourselves, and everyone else.

749
00:32:35.377 --> 00:32:37.943
Because when I go through that,

750
00:32:37.943 --> 00:32:39.313
that darkness is not different

751
00:32:39.313 --> 00:32:41.217
than the darkness in anyone else.

752
00:32:41.217 --> 00:32:44.317
It's one consciousness, one light,

753
00:32:44.317 --> 00:32:46.453
and when we are the instruments of that,

754
00:32:46.453 --> 00:32:48.485
we're actually serving not just ourselves,

755
00:32:48.485 --> 00:32:51.120
but the whole of humanity for a purpose

756
00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.523
greater than we can know while we're doing it.

757
00:32:53.523 --> 00:32:55.288
It's impossible to know the outcome.

758
00:32:55.288 --> 00:32:58.768
What is new doesn't even know itself, Regina.

759
00:32:58.768 --> 00:33:01.450
It's just new.
(both laugh)

760
00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:03.332
<v Regina>Well on that note, I would certainly</v>

761
00:33:03.332 --> 00:33:05.143
encourage everybody to pick up a copy

762
00:33:05.143 --> 00:33:07.012
of your new book and also your other works,

763
00:33:07.012 --> 00:33:08.405
and I know you don't like to do

764
00:33:08.405 --> 00:33:10.182
a lot of these conferences and such,

765
00:33:10.182 --> 00:33:13.415
but can people find a way to you, to attend some of your--

766
00:33:13.415 --> 00:33:14.785
<v ->Oh, yes, please.</v>

767
00:33:14.785 --> 00:33:17.977
The new book is The Essential Laws of Fearless Living.

768
00:33:17.977 --> 00:33:22.977
And I have a website, guyfinley.org,

769
00:33:23.163 --> 00:33:24.603

L-E-Y
<v Regina>And we'll be sure</v>

771
00:33:25.745 --> 00:33:27.265
to put it right here for you.

772
00:33:27.265 --> 00:33:31.724
<v ->And just so people know, you can spend six months there</v>

773
00:33:31.724 --> 00:33:33.837

774

free MP3s, PDFs, books, everything.

775
00:33:36.275 --> 00:33:37.122
<v Regina>Fabulous.</v>

776
00:33:37.122 --> 00:33:40.094
<v ->My foundation, we have not one salaried employee</v>

777
00:33:40.094 --> 00:33:41.906
at Life of Learning Foundation.

778
00:33:41.906 --> 00:33:43.995
Everything we do is to get this information out,

779
00:33:43.995 --> 00:33:45.390
so when you go to Life of Learning,

780

first, in our change ourselves,

785
00:34:01.523 --> 00:34:03.055
we change the world that we're in.

786
00:34:03.055 --> 00:34:04.404
<v Regina>We need the light.</v>

787
00:34:04.404 --> 00:34:06.898
And thank you for your work and helping bring that.

788
00:34:06.898 --> 00:34:08.907
<v ->Thank you, Regina.</v>

789
00:34:08.907 --> 00:34:12.576
(jazzy piano music)

790
00:34:12.576 --> 00:34:14.433
