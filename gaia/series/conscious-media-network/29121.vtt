00:00:00.727 --> 00:00:02.977
(calm music)

2
00:00:13.617 --> 00:00:15.350
<v ->There are no shortages of interpretations</v>

3
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.896
of the Bible out there.

4
00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:19.125
But Rocco Errico says it's wise to look

5
00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:21.355
at the original language of the New Testament

6
00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:22.656
to understand the teachings

7
00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:24.768
of the prophet known as Jesus.

8
00:00:24.768 --> 00:00:26.634
Known as an Aramic Scholar,

9
00:00:26.634 --> 00:00:28.138
Rocco has a very different take

10
00:00:28.138 --> 00:00:29.994
on what the teachings were about.

11
00:00:29.994 --> 00:00:31.626
The central message, he says,

12
00:00:31.626 --> 00:00:34.548
is about each man embodying the god within

13
00:00:34.548 --> 00:00:37.817
and living in unity and peace.

14
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:46.953
Rocco, you're such an interesting person.

15
00:00:46.953 --> 00:00:48.233
I love your work.

16
00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:50.483
I love listening to the passion

17
00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:53.203
in which you relay your message.

18
00:00:53.203 --> 00:00:54.622
You're a unique person because you've

19
00:00:54.622 --> 00:00:57.384
actually delved deep into Aramaic

20
00:00:57.384 --> 00:00:59.635
to get to the bottom of the original

21
00:00:59.635 --> 00:01:02.653
teachings of Jesus, of which, you are a follower.

22
00:01:02.653 --> 00:01:05.811
However, your work is extremely controversial

23
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:07.720
among the Christian community.

24
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.714
<v ->Very controversial.</v>

25
00:01:09.714 --> 00:01:12.669
Not only because I represent the Aramaic language,

26
00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:14.866
which was the language of Jesus Christ,

27
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:17.799
the language of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,

28
00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.794
most people think they spoke Hebrew,

29
00:01:19.794 --> 00:01:22.002
but they didn't, they spoke Aramaic.

30
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:23.527
Scriptures tell you themselves

31
00:01:23.527 --> 00:01:25.991
that Abraham was an Aramean.

32
00:01:25.991 --> 00:01:26.917
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

33
00:01:26.917 --> 00:01:28.815
<v ->Either way you want to say it.</v>

34
00:01:28.815 --> 00:01:29.978
So, he spoke Aramaic.

35
00:01:29.978 --> 00:01:32.015
Later on, from Aramaic,

36
00:01:32.015 --> 00:01:36.079
the dialect developed, which became Hebrew.

37
00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.256
So the roots of Hebrew and Arabic,

38
00:01:40.256 --> 00:01:41.152
the roots of it,

39
00:01:41.152 --> 00:01:44.010
is the Aramaic language.

40
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.664
<v Regina>That's before the road forked.</v>

41
00:01:45.664 --> 00:01:47.345
Let's get back to your own life.

42
00:01:47.345 --> 00:01:50.267
What propelled you into studying this,

43
00:01:50.267 --> 00:01:51.772
very deeply esoteric language

44
00:01:51.772 --> 00:01:54.076
and becoming quite a scholar to the point

45
00:01:54.076 --> 00:01:56.963
where many people refer to your work?

46
00:01:56.963 --> 00:01:57.987
<v ->The reason for that is,</v>

47
00:01:57.987 --> 00:02:00.685
I was always interested in Scripture.

48
00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:02.050
From when I was little,

49
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.117
I was always fascinated.

50
00:02:03.117 --> 00:02:06.155
I come really from an Italian family.

51
00:02:06.155 --> 00:02:07.190
<v Regina >Oh, you'd suppose with a name</v>

52
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.205
like Rocco Ericco...

53
00:02:09.205 --> 00:02:10.180
<v ->Ericco is really the way...</v>

54
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.994
<v Regina>Ericco. And beautiful olive skin.</v>

55
00:02:11.994 --> 00:02:13.178
<v ->No one ever says it that way.</v>

56
00:02:13.178 --> 00:02:14.127
Everyone says Ericco,

57
00:02:14.127 --> 00:02:17.940
which is the Anglical way of saying it.

58
00:02:19.663 --> 00:02:20.826
What happened is,

59
00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:23.429
my grandfather used to tell me Bible stories.

60
00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:25.594
I did not know, at the time, when I was little,

61
00:02:25.594 --> 00:02:27.194
that my grandfather didn't know how

62
00:02:27.194 --> 00:02:28.239
to read and write.

63
00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.508
Not even Italian.

64
00:02:29.508 --> 00:02:30.767
It was my grandmother who knew

65
00:02:30.767 --> 00:02:31.855
how to read and write.

66
00:02:31.855 --> 00:02:33.785
She always read the Bible.

67
00:02:33.785 --> 00:02:36.644
She read it to my grandfather.

68
00:02:36.644 --> 00:02:39.193
Then he would always relate the stories to me.

69
00:02:39.193 --> 00:02:40.431
They always fascinated me,

70
00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:42.052
and I was always interested in Scripture.

71
00:02:42.052 --> 00:02:44.143
Although I was brought up Roman Catholic,

72
00:02:44.143 --> 00:02:47.471
and I had also studied with the priest, afterwards,

73
00:02:47.471 --> 00:02:49.209
to become a priest.

74
00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.393
But then it changed.

75
00:02:50.393 --> 00:02:52.526
Which is another story which I won't go into.

76
00:02:52.526 --> 00:02:54.382
But it changed.

77
00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:58.286
Then I got involved in Protestantism,

78
00:02:58.286 --> 00:03:02.557
and I was on the fundamental side of it.

79
00:03:03.535 --> 00:03:05.838
The fundamental side of it,

80
00:03:05.838 --> 00:03:09.135
after being in it for about a couple of years,

81
00:03:09.135 --> 00:03:10.532
felt too narrow to me.

82
00:03:10.532 --> 00:03:12.452
There's something wrong with this.

83
00:03:12.452 --> 00:03:14.458
I couldn't put my finger on it,

84
00:03:14.458 --> 00:03:17.636
so I kept studying all kinds of books,

85
00:03:17.636 --> 00:03:20.462
all kinds of reading.

86
00:03:20.462 --> 00:03:23.694
Of course, I also went to school,

87
00:03:23.694 --> 00:03:27.123
Bible school and all that whole thing.

88
00:03:27.194 --> 00:03:29.920
I still wasn't getting satisfied.

89
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.968
Then I finally was pastoring some churches

90
00:03:31.968 --> 00:03:34.400
in San Antonio, Texas,

91
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.898
and I was the Associate Pastor of a nice congregation

92
00:03:38.898 --> 00:03:40.360
in San Antonio,

93
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.236
and that's where I did most of my research work.

94
00:03:44.594 --> 00:03:47.927
I happened to, which is another story,

95
00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:50.046
come upon these people who had heard

96
00:03:50.046 --> 00:03:52.254
Dr. George M. Lamsa,

97
00:03:52.254 --> 00:03:54.309
who was from the Near East,

98
00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:57.328
and he translated the entire Bible

99
00:03:57.328 --> 00:04:00.506
from Aramaic into English.

100
00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:05.130
HarperCollins publishes that Bible in English.

101
00:04:05.701 --> 00:04:06.831
<v Regina>What is it called?</v>

102
00:04:06.831 --> 00:04:10.562
<v ->It's called the Lamsa Translation.</v>

103
00:04:10.562 --> 00:04:14.849
L-A-M-S-A Translation.

104
00:04:15.644 --> 00:04:17.596
But he was fought tooth and toenail

105
00:04:17.596 --> 00:04:21.930
when he first did the four Gospels from Aramaic,

106
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.776
because he claimed that Aramaic

107
00:04:24.776 --> 00:04:29.388
is the original of the New Testament, not Greek.

108
00:04:30.078 --> 00:04:34.398
This brought the scholarship down on him.

109
00:04:34.398 --> 00:04:36.744
All the scholars came down on him.

110
00:04:36.744 --> 00:04:38.849
Because we all teach, here in the West,

111
00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.910
that Greek is the original of the New Testament,

112
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.929
not Aramaic.

113
00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:48.246
So that brought a lot of controversy.

114
00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:49.688
But I began to read it and study it.

115
00:04:49.688 --> 00:04:52.013
I thought, well, I know Jesus spoke Aramaic.

116
00:04:52.013 --> 00:04:55.075
Why wouldn't his teachings be put in Aramaic?

117
00:04:55.075 --> 00:04:57.464
Why should it be put in Greek first?

118
00:04:57.464 --> 00:05:00.493
The Greeks did adopt Jesus' teachings later.

119
00:05:00.493 --> 00:05:04.070
In fact, helped pollute his teachings.

120
00:05:05.452 --> 00:05:06.636
<v Regina>There's been a lot of pollution</v>

121
00:05:06.636 --> 00:05:07.703
on a lot of fronts there.

122
00:05:07.703 --> 00:05:09.281
<v ->Right, so this was it.</v>

123
00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:10.582
This was what he faced.

124
00:05:10.582 --> 00:05:12.278
I got ahold of that, and I thought,

125
00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:13.556
this is what I have been waiting for.

126
00:05:13.556 --> 00:05:16.830
I got his book, My Neighbor Jesus,

127
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.878
because he was Assyrian,

128
00:05:18.878 --> 00:05:20.713
and his native tongue was Aramaic.

129
00:05:20.713 --> 00:05:23.006
So this is the first time we have a translator

130
00:05:23.006 --> 00:05:26.675
translating directly from his own native language.

131
00:05:26.675 --> 00:05:27.050
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

132
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.372
<v ->Not only that,</v>

133
00:05:28.372 --> 00:05:31.092
he was from Northern Iraq.

134
00:05:31.092 --> 00:05:33.465
Now we're talking about in the

135
00:05:33.465 --> 00:05:37.206
late 1800s, where they were isolated,

136
00:05:37.206 --> 00:05:40.480
they were groups of Christians

137
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.913
on like a little island,

138
00:05:41.913 --> 00:05:43.651
but there's no island there,

139
00:05:43.651 --> 00:05:45.646
but I'm just using it as a metaphor,

140
00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:49.282
in a sea of Muslim people

141
00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:50.553
was this Christian.

142
00:05:50.553 --> 00:05:54.351
They were descendants of the ancient Assyrians

143
00:05:54.351 --> 00:05:57.369
and they were followers of Jesus.

144
00:05:57.369 --> 00:05:58.788
So when he came here to the states,

145
00:05:58.788 --> 00:05:59.972
he didn't know all this stuff

146
00:05:59.972 --> 00:06:01.801
that we were talking about Jesus.

147
00:06:01.801 --> 00:06:04.094
So he began to write about it,

148
00:06:04.094 --> 00:06:06.110
that Jesus wasn't forsaken on the cross,

149
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.209
and all these different things

150
00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:10.112
that we teach here in the West.

151
00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:12.794
When I got ahold of that,

152
00:06:12.794 --> 00:06:14.426
I thought this is what I've been waiting for

153
00:06:14.426 --> 00:06:15.280
with the Scriptures.

154
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.445
So much stuff didn't make sense

155
00:06:17.445 --> 00:06:19.045
when I read the Scriptures.

156
00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.647
I thought, why is there so much contradiction.

157
00:06:21.647 --> 00:06:23.567
They keep coming out with one translation

158
00:06:23.567 --> 00:06:25.807
after another, after another, after another,

159
00:06:25.807 --> 00:06:27.023
to try and improve it.

160
00:06:27.023 --> 00:06:28.847
But they still make it worse.

161
00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:30.617
<v Regina>Let me ask you a question at this point.</v>

162
00:06:30.617 --> 00:06:33.327
When you take this, and this isn't...

163
00:06:33.327 --> 00:06:35.673
it may sound like, it's not a touchy feely question,

164
00:06:35.673 --> 00:06:37.838
in your heart, were things just not resolving

165
00:06:37.838 --> 00:06:39.417
properly with all this information?

166
00:06:39.417 --> 00:06:41.081
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

167
00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:43.225
That I was getting in my other training.

168
00:06:43.225 --> 00:06:44.652
I thought, I'm not happy.

169
00:06:44.652 --> 00:06:46.204
Something is not right with it.

170
00:06:46.204 --> 00:06:48.448
It was in my heart that I felt this.

171
00:06:48.448 --> 00:06:50.241
But I couldn't put my finger on it.

172
00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:53.366
I thought, how could,

173
00:06:53.366 --> 00:06:54.305
as people were teaching,

174
00:06:54.305 --> 00:06:55.712
that God is a wrathful God,

175
00:06:55.712 --> 00:06:58.763
and then Jesus softened God's heart

176
00:06:58.763 --> 00:07:00.128
through his sacrifice on the cross.

177
00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:03.125
I thought, but how could God kill his son

178
00:07:03.125 --> 00:07:05.792
and then forgive me?

179
00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:07.249
What kind of a god is that?

180
00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:08.258
<v Regina>Yeah, I had some issues</v>

181
00:07:08.258 --> 00:07:10.868
when I was young too on all of this.

182
00:07:11.215 --> 00:07:14.009
<v ->Yet, the Scriptures seemed to read that way.</v>

183
00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:17.598
I thought, there's something not right.

184
00:07:18.862 --> 00:07:21.594
That's what got me on my adventure going forward.

185
00:07:21.594 --> 00:07:23.407
Of course, I studied other religions, too,

186
00:07:23.407 --> 00:07:26.874
Buddhism, Islam, all of it, I went into all of it.

187
00:07:26.874 --> 00:07:28.932
Although I never told my congregation

188
00:07:28.932 --> 00:07:30.053
that I was doing that.

189
00:07:30.053 --> 00:07:30.470
<v Regina>Right.</v>

190
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.347
<v ->But once I got ahold of the Lamsa Bible,</v>

191
00:07:32.347 --> 00:07:34.395
I was using it from the pulpit

192
00:07:34.395 --> 00:07:35.995
and not telling them what translation

193
00:07:35.995 --> 00:07:36.997
I was reading from.

194
00:07:36.997 --> 00:07:37.414
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>

195
00:07:37.414 --> 00:07:39.587
<v ->In the English.</v>

196
00:07:39.743 --> 00:07:40.714
They all wanted it.

197
00:07:40.714 --> 00:07:42.132
They said, "Oh, that's fascinating.

198
00:07:42.132 --> 00:07:44.127
"That's so clear.

199
00:07:44.127 --> 00:07:45.759
"It's so much clearer than the King James

200
00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:48.777
"and all these other English versions we had".

201
00:07:48.777 --> 00:07:50.697
They said, "What are you reading from?"

202
00:07:50.697 --> 00:07:54.654
I said, "English translation from Aramaic,

203
00:07:54.654 --> 00:07:56.698
"done by a native."

204
00:07:56.698 --> 00:07:58.693
That's what got me started in the work.

205
00:07:58.693 --> 00:08:02.426
Then I opened up classes all over the State of Texas

206
00:08:02.426 --> 00:08:05.082
and I started with, maybe 11 people,

207
00:08:05.082 --> 00:08:08.053
and I always ended up with two or three hundred.

208
00:08:08.053 --> 00:08:09.909
Then I wrote Dr. Lamsa,

209
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:13.162
and he came to me in 1965,

210
00:08:13.162 --> 00:08:15.669
and that began our friendship together

211
00:08:15.669 --> 00:08:17.428
and working together.

212
00:08:17.428 --> 00:08:20.522
We worked together 10 years.

213
00:08:20.522 --> 00:08:22.549
<v Regina>You took this on 100%?</v>

214
00:08:22.549 --> 00:08:25.215
You speak Aramaic, you can more or less

215
00:08:25.215 --> 00:08:26.464
translate and speak.
<v ->I read and write Aramaic.</v>

216
00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:28.343
<v Regina>Read and write Aramaic, yes.</v>

217
00:08:28.343 --> 00:08:29.922
<v ->I don't use it as a spoken language.</v>

218
00:08:29.922 --> 00:08:32.476
Unless you do, it dies.

219
00:08:32.546 --> 00:08:34.029
But I can read and write it.

220
00:08:34.029 --> 00:08:35.565
I use the New Testament in Aramaic,

221
00:08:35.565 --> 00:08:38.562
and I use his translation too, in English.

222
00:08:38.562 --> 00:08:40.812
But I also have the Aramaic texts

223
00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:41.944
that I read from.

224
00:08:41.944 --> 00:08:43.854
<v Regina>When you look at the translations</v>

225
00:08:43.854 --> 00:08:45.059
that I've seen in some of your work,

226
00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:47.683
even starting with the most basic, the Lord's prayer

227
00:08:47.683 --> 00:08:50.637
for example, it doesn't look a whole lot like

228
00:08:50.637 --> 00:08:52.333
the Lord's prayer that we said

229
00:08:52.333 --> 00:08:55.298
in our Lutheran Sunday School in church every week.

230
00:08:55.298 --> 00:08:57.389
<v ->One of the basic difference is,</v>

231
00:08:57.389 --> 00:08:59.501
in the prayer, where we say,

232
00:08:59.501 --> 00:09:01.709
and do not lead us into temptation,

233
00:09:01.709 --> 00:09:04.546
can you imagine God leading you into temptation?

234
00:09:04.546 --> 00:09:08.162
Scholars still, in Greek, have this problem.

235
00:09:08.162 --> 00:09:10.209
They say, don't bring this to the test.

236
00:09:10.209 --> 00:09:12.087
There is so many different translations

237
00:09:12.087 --> 00:09:15.793
of that one verse in the Lord's prayer

238
00:09:16.068 --> 00:09:19.300
that they can't straighten it out.

239
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.548
The only one way they can straighten it out

240
00:09:20.548 --> 00:09:22.319
is through Aramaic.

241
00:09:22.319 --> 00:09:25.828
And it's (speaking in foreign language),

242
00:09:25.828 --> 00:09:27.529
which means, and do not let us

243
00:09:27.529 --> 00:09:29.957
enter into temptation.

244
00:09:30.657 --> 00:09:33.298
The word is (speaks in foreign language)

245
00:09:33.298 --> 00:09:35.037
and it's a reflexive verb,

246
00:09:35.037 --> 00:09:37.895
do not let us enter into temptation,

247
00:09:37.895 --> 00:09:41.585
not don't lead me into temptation.

248
00:09:42.795 --> 00:09:44.969
<v Regina>It sounds like these might be subtle differences.</v>

249
00:09:44.969 --> 00:09:45.566
They're not.

250
00:09:45.566 --> 00:09:47.891
There's nothing subtle about these differences at all.

251
00:09:47.891 --> 00:09:51.486
The entire tone is something that is much more

252
00:09:51.486 --> 00:09:54.184
gracious and loving and supportive

253
00:09:54.184 --> 00:09:57.544
when you read the Aramaic translation of the Lord's prayer.

254
00:09:57.544 --> 00:09:59.144
<v ->Yes, and every place in the Bible where it says</v>

255
00:09:59.144 --> 00:10:01.000
God's a jealous God,

256
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.909
Aramaic says zealous.

257
00:10:02.909 --> 00:10:06.486
Now the Hebrew Bible is now no longer using jealous.

258
00:10:06.486 --> 00:10:08.924
They're using the word impassioned.

259
00:10:08.924 --> 00:10:11.864
<v Regina>Zealous, amazing what the difference</v>

260
00:10:11.864 --> 00:10:13.102
one letter will make.

261
00:10:13.102 --> 00:10:14.030
(laughter)

262
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.889
Let's go into some of what you were teaching

263
00:10:16.889 --> 00:10:19.651
that was not necessarily accepted

264
00:10:19.651 --> 00:10:21.091
throughout the Christian community

265
00:10:21.091 --> 00:10:23.869
and some of the really common perceptions

266
00:10:23.869 --> 00:10:28.051
of Christianity, across the board.

267
00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:30.383
I was listening to you lecture

268
00:10:30.383 --> 00:10:32.431
on a few of them the other day,

269
00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:33.828
one of the things you talked about is

270
00:10:33.828 --> 00:10:36.772
a lot of Jesus' work actually was inspired by

271
00:10:36.772 --> 00:10:39.161
or taken forward from John the Baptist,

272
00:10:39.161 --> 00:10:43.386
who was a very, kind of a radical,

273
00:10:43.386 --> 00:10:47.026
the original conspiracy theorist on a certain level.

274
00:10:47.268 --> 00:10:48.494
<v ->He was a fiery prophet,</v>

275
00:10:48.494 --> 00:10:51.001
he was like Elijah and Elisha,

276
00:10:51.001 --> 00:10:52.667
the Old Testament prophets.

277
00:10:52.667 --> 00:10:55.589
He was the last of that kind of prophet.

278
00:10:55.589 --> 00:10:56.453
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

279
00:10:56.453 --> 00:10:58.192
<v ->The fiery kind.</v>

280
00:10:58.192 --> 00:11:01.307
He believed that the Kingdom of Heaven,

281
00:11:01.307 --> 00:11:03.536
what we call the Kingdom of God,

282
00:11:03.536 --> 00:11:06.914
was coming, but in it it had wrath.

283
00:11:06.914 --> 00:11:08.548
<v Regina>Uh oh, and it's coming after us.</v>

284
00:11:08.548 --> 00:11:09.636
(laughter)

285
00:11:11.176 --> 00:11:12.366
<v ->Because of the injustice,</v>

286
00:11:12.366 --> 00:11:15.509
you have to understand why it refers to wrath,

287
00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:18.645
because of the injustices that human beings

288
00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:19.669
do to each other.

289
00:11:19.669 --> 00:11:20.362
<v Regina>Right.</v>

290
00:11:20.362 --> 00:11:21.813
And assuming that there has to be something

291
00:11:21.813 --> 00:11:23.930
meated out for that.

292
00:11:23.989 --> 00:11:26.431
<v ->The ancient understanding of God is</v>

293
00:11:26.431 --> 00:11:29.215
you meet evil with evil.

294
00:11:29.215 --> 00:11:30.026
You see that?

295
00:11:30.026 --> 00:11:32.532
You'll find that throughout the entire Old Testament.

296
00:11:32.532 --> 00:11:33.951
Like Noah and the flood.

297
00:11:33.951 --> 00:11:36.361
If you read about the flood in the Old Testament,

298
00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:38.686
how did God solve...

299
00:11:38.686 --> 00:11:41.331
It says he was sorry he made man.

300
00:11:41.331 --> 00:11:43.561
God never was sorry he made man.

301
00:11:43.561 --> 00:11:46.302
This is a scribal notation that was

302
00:11:46.302 --> 00:11:50.184
put into the Scripture, because of the flood that came.

303
00:11:50.184 --> 00:11:52.491
Well, God brought it, because they attributed

304
00:11:52.491 --> 00:11:55.414
everything to God in the Old Testament, everything.

305
00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:57.942
If you stubbed your toe, God did it.

306
00:11:57.942 --> 00:12:00.224
If someone died in the family, God took them.

307
00:12:00.224 --> 00:12:03.183
<v Regina>Very victim oriented.</v>

308
00:12:03.183 --> 00:12:05.397
<v ->Because that's the only concept they had.</v>

309
00:12:05.397 --> 00:12:07.701
You gotta realize, people don't realize,

310
00:12:07.701 --> 00:12:10.741
the Scriptures is a story

311
00:12:10.741 --> 00:12:14.293
of ascending consciousness.

312
00:12:14.293 --> 00:12:18.079
It's transcending each stage, you see?

313
00:12:18.079 --> 00:12:20.330
It's human development.

314
00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.975
Their understanding of God is in

315
00:12:22.975 --> 00:12:26.154
a constant transcendent state.

316
00:12:26.154 --> 00:12:27.967
So they believed they had no devil.

317
00:12:27.967 --> 00:12:30.943
They didn't have any devil to blame.

318
00:12:30.943 --> 00:12:32.660
Their god, they believed, was in control.

319
00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.046
So anything that happened

320
00:12:34.046 --> 00:12:36.628
was always attributed to God.

321
00:12:36.628 --> 00:12:38.953
<v Regina>If we look at this and consider the times,</v>

322
00:12:38.953 --> 00:12:40.979
coming out of Egypt, which a lot of the people

323
00:12:40.979 --> 00:12:42.600
in this region did come out of Egypt

324
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.574
in the ancient traditions, in which there were

325
00:12:44.574 --> 00:12:46.366
many gods at that time as well.

326
00:12:46.366 --> 00:12:49.192
You had a god over your affairs of food and kitchen,

327
00:12:49.192 --> 00:12:51.421
a god over birth, a god over so forth,

328
00:12:51.421 --> 00:12:54.098
so the cultures were very steeped already

329
00:12:54.098 --> 00:12:58.343
in attributing all actions to a god of some kind.

330
00:12:58.343 --> 00:13:00.433
<v ->Right, even the animals.</v>

331
00:13:00.433 --> 00:13:01.873
<v Regina>Right, right.</v>

332
00:13:01.873 --> 00:13:03.046
<v ->But with this case,</v>

333
00:13:03.046 --> 00:13:04.699
no image could be made of God,

334
00:13:04.699 --> 00:13:07.366
which is in the three monotheistic religions

335
00:13:07.366 --> 00:13:11.131
of Judaism, Christianity, the ancient Christianity,

336
00:13:11.131 --> 00:13:14.399
and Islam.

337
00:13:15.215 --> 00:13:17.658
Which is true, absolutely true.

338
00:13:17.658 --> 00:13:19.354
No images should be made,

339
00:13:19.354 --> 00:13:21.305
because God was spirit.

340
00:13:21.305 --> 00:13:22.351
Not an image.

341
00:13:22.351 --> 00:13:23.695
You cannot make an image of God

342
00:13:23.695 --> 00:13:26.638
as a human being, or as an animal,

343
00:13:26.638 --> 00:13:29.038
or as plants, or as trees,

344
00:13:29.038 --> 00:13:31.353
these are all the creations

345
00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:33.262
that come out of God.

346
00:13:33.262 --> 00:13:34.862
But God is none of those things.

347
00:13:34.862 --> 00:13:35.940
<v Regina>It comes out of the mindset</v>

348
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.623
of the time, of course,

349
00:13:36.623 --> 00:13:40.430
highly patriarchal the last few thousand years, for example,

350
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.701
so of course it's going to be a man with a white beard

351
00:13:43.701 --> 00:13:45.049
in the sky with a staff, and so forth.

352
00:13:45.049 --> 00:13:46.030
<v ->We invented that.</v>

353
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.568
<v Regina>Of course.</v>

354
00:13:47.568 --> 00:13:51.084
<v ->They didn't invent that in the Near East.</v>

355
00:13:51.084 --> 00:13:54.891
<v Regina>But still, even today, when you think of God,</v>

356
00:13:54.891 --> 00:13:57.633
it's still automatically,

357
00:13:57.633 --> 00:13:59.211
it pours out of our mouths out of habit,

358
00:13:59.211 --> 00:14:00.342
this is a he.

359
00:14:00.342 --> 00:14:02.294
We don't look at it as gender neutral,

360
00:14:02.294 --> 00:14:04.544
we don't look at it as possibly being feminine,

361
00:14:04.544 --> 00:14:08.427
we only see it as a he and this has had a big stamp

362
00:14:08.427 --> 00:14:10.464
on the lives of all of the cultures

363
00:14:10.464 --> 00:14:11.648
that have come out of that time,

364
00:14:11.648 --> 00:14:14.042
right up to this very day.

365
00:14:14.208 --> 00:14:16.870
<v ->Because this is grammar.</v>

366
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.288
But we made it something else.

367
00:14:19.288 --> 00:14:22.819
As I tried to explain when I did the Lord's prayer,

368
00:14:22.819 --> 00:14:24.653
is the term Father,

369
00:14:24.653 --> 00:14:26.648
because when I even wrote my book

370
00:14:26.648 --> 00:14:28.941
on the ancient Aramaic prayer of Jesus,

371
00:14:28.941 --> 00:14:30.967
and then later on changed its name to

372
00:14:30.967 --> 00:14:34.052
Setting a Trap for God...

373
00:14:35.998 --> 00:14:38.622
I don't know why, but I forgot to put in there

374
00:14:38.622 --> 00:14:40.851
the meaning of the term Father.

375
00:14:40.851 --> 00:14:42.387
<v Regina>Which is?</v>

376
00:14:42.387 --> 00:14:44.689
<v ->Which I'm gonna get to in a minute.</v>

377
00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:47.590
Because I started getting irate letters

378
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:51.802
here in the West, from feminists.

379
00:14:52.181 --> 00:14:53.136
Blaming me.

380
00:14:53.136 --> 00:14:55.247
I said, well, number one, I would always

381
00:14:55.247 --> 00:14:59.194
respond to the letters, I don't care how irate they were,

382
00:14:59.194 --> 00:15:00.925
and I would tell them,

383
00:15:00.925 --> 00:15:04.336
please don't blame me for calling God Father.

384
00:15:04.336 --> 00:15:08.592
I said, Jesus is the one who originated this term,

385
00:15:08.592 --> 00:15:11.002
calling God Father, and the Jewish people

386
00:15:11.002 --> 00:15:12.751
and some of the Psalms

387
00:15:12.751 --> 00:15:14.309
refer to God as Father too.

388
00:15:14.309 --> 00:15:16.900
But Jesus really built on that.

389
00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.066
I said, first of all, it's not my term,

390
00:15:19.066 --> 00:15:20.292
and I'm working with the Scriptures,

391
00:15:20.292 --> 00:15:22.777
so I have to use those terms, Father.

392
00:15:22.777 --> 00:15:25.028
But there is something more to consider,

393
00:15:25.028 --> 00:15:25.892
that most people don't,

394
00:15:25.892 --> 00:15:27.790
and I didn't put it in my book.

395
00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:29.230
In my next addition of the book,

396
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.043
I'm going to be putting it in there.

397
00:15:31.043 --> 00:15:32.665
It is in my German,

398
00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:34.275
and in the Italian.

399
00:15:34.275 --> 00:15:36.547
The Italian edition, and the German edition

400
00:15:36.547 --> 00:15:39.128
that's published in Germany and in Italy,

401
00:15:39.128 --> 00:15:40.611
it is in there.

402
00:15:40.611 --> 00:15:41.400
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

403
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.448
<v ->What I'm gonna tell you now.</v>

404
00:15:43.448 --> 00:15:47.474
The word Father is a term of endearment.

405
00:15:47.651 --> 00:15:48.580
<v Regina>Oh.</v>

406
00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.523
<v ->It wasn't trying to categorize God.</v>

407
00:15:51.523 --> 00:15:52.451
<v Regina>Genderize, yeah.</v>

408
00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:55.311
<v ->Genderize, right.</v>

409
00:15:55.311 --> 00:15:58.361
Like we use the term, honey, sweetheart,

410
00:15:58.361 --> 00:16:01.032
darling, precious.

411
00:16:03.332 --> 00:16:05.131
It's not gender specific, is it?

412
00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:06.988
<v Regina>Interesting, because if you go then over</v>

413
00:16:06.988 --> 00:16:09.067
into the Sufism in Rumi,

414
00:16:09.067 --> 00:16:11.083
he always called it beloved.

415
00:16:11.083 --> 00:16:13.825
<v ->Well, that's what I'm gonna get to.</v>

416
00:16:13.825 --> 00:16:16.150
The term father meant beloved.

417
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.349
The term mother means beloved.

418
00:16:19.349 --> 00:16:23.227
It had nothing to do with which gender.

419
00:16:23.564 --> 00:16:27.073
It was a way of calling God the beloved,

420
00:16:27.073 --> 00:16:30.038
and Jesus preferred that.

421
00:16:30.038 --> 00:16:32.758
Because they don't like to use the term God.

422
00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:34.241
Even today, among the Jewish people,

423
00:16:34.241 --> 00:16:36.406
they don't use the term God.

424
00:16:36.406 --> 00:16:38.976
They refer to him as Hashem,

425
00:16:38.976 --> 00:16:41.163
the name.

426
00:16:41.163 --> 00:16:42.859
But father was a term of endearment.

427
00:16:42.859 --> 00:16:44.341
Let me tell you something,

428
00:16:44.341 --> 00:16:46.869
that's even prevalent today in Arabic.

429
00:16:46.869 --> 00:16:50.122
It's still prevalent by Aramaic speaking people today

430
00:16:50.122 --> 00:16:51.562
that come from the Near East,

431
00:16:51.562 --> 00:16:53.057
not born here in the West,

432
00:16:53.057 --> 00:16:57.210
but born in the Near East and have come here.

433
00:16:57.792 --> 00:16:59.350
A mother and a father will call

434
00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:02.560
their son or daughter Father.

435
00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.861
<v Regina>Beloved.</v>

436
00:17:03.861 --> 00:17:04.843
<v ->Beloved.</v>

437
00:17:04.843 --> 00:17:08.726
Two sisters will call each other Father.

438
00:17:08.726 --> 00:17:11.628
<v Regina>That's very clarifying.</v>

439
00:17:11.628 --> 00:17:12.396
<v ->Not only that.</v>

440
00:17:12.396 --> 00:17:14.849
Two friends, if they're close,

441
00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:16.289
they have to be close friends,

442
00:17:16.289 --> 00:17:18.849
will call each other Father.

443
00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:20.193
<v Regina>That's very interesting.</v>

444
00:17:20.193 --> 00:17:22.532
<v ->We wouldn't do that in the West, not friendship.</v>

445
00:17:22.532 --> 00:17:25.763
<v Regina>No, no, we have a specific image</v>

446
00:17:25.763 --> 00:17:27.045
of what that word means.

447
00:17:27.045 --> 00:17:28.581
<v ->But this is beloved,</v>

448
00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:30.042
it's a term of endearment.

449
00:17:30.042 --> 00:17:34.989
When you say, "Our Father, who is in heaven",

450
00:17:34.996 --> 00:17:36.372
and the reason heaven is used

451
00:17:36.372 --> 00:17:39.806
is the heavenly father, the heavenly beloved.

452
00:17:39.806 --> 00:17:43.753
So you don't confuse it with an earthly father,

453
00:17:43.753 --> 00:17:45.171
meaning beloved.

454
00:17:45.171 --> 00:17:46.750
But you could say mother and meaning beloved.

455
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.808
A mother will also call her son mother in Arabic.

456
00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:55.405
I've heard...

457
00:17:56.616 --> 00:17:58.056
I was called, for instance,

458
00:17:58.056 --> 00:18:02.002
when Dr. Lamsa's niece, my mentor's niece

459
00:18:02.002 --> 00:18:03.581
called me after he passed away,

460
00:18:03.581 --> 00:18:07.250
because I did the interment and all that,

461
00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:09.320
and when she'd call me all the time,

462
00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.378
or I'd call her,

463
00:18:11.378 --> 00:18:12.658
first thing she would call me is,

464
00:18:12.658 --> 00:18:15.795
oh father, I'm so glad you called.

465
00:18:15.795 --> 00:18:16.819
I'm not her father.

466
00:18:16.819 --> 00:18:19.090
She was older than I was too.

467
00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:21.416
But she always called me Father.

468
00:18:21.416 --> 00:18:23.019
Which means beloved.

469
00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:25.850
Or like we would say,

470
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.400
it's a close sense of friendship.

471
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.695
What Jesus was creating by using this term,

472
00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:34.831
in the Near Eastern setting,

473
00:18:34.831 --> 00:18:39.710
among Semites, it meant someone that is precious,

474
00:18:40.324 --> 00:18:42.873
dear to you, dear to you.

475
00:18:42.873 --> 00:18:45.775
So when we're saying our father who is in heaven,

476
00:18:45.775 --> 00:18:47.748
we're saying, oh, dear one,

477
00:18:47.748 --> 00:18:51.720
oh, beloved, oh, honey.

478
00:18:51.727 --> 00:18:53.370
<v Regina>I'm glad we clarified that.</v>

479
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.322
Because it's something I've wondered about,

480
00:18:55.322 --> 00:18:56.879
how that was being perpetuated,

481
00:18:56.879 --> 00:18:58.458
so that was very helpful, I think

482
00:18:58.458 --> 00:19:00.847
for probably just about everybody listening,

483
00:19:00.847 --> 00:19:03.193
unless they are also Aramaic scholars.

484
00:19:03.193 --> 00:19:03.929
Let's talk about some of the...

485
00:19:03.929 --> 00:19:05.807
<v ->Aramaic scholars don't know it,</v>

486
00:19:05.807 --> 00:19:08.581
because what makes this extra is

487
00:19:08.581 --> 00:19:12.015
I am familiar with an Ancient Near Eastern culture.

488
00:19:12.015 --> 00:19:15.601
Dr. Lamsa came from the most ancient

489
00:19:15.601 --> 00:19:18.951
practices in the Near East.

490
00:19:18.951 --> 00:19:20.404
<v Regina>The Assyrians, yes.</v>

491
00:19:20.404 --> 00:19:22.557
<v ->So I learned those ancient,</v>

492
00:19:22.557 --> 00:19:25.086
which are dying in the Near East today.

493
00:19:25.086 --> 00:19:26.569
A lot of these things I'm saying,

494
00:19:26.569 --> 00:19:28.404
except for the term Father,

495
00:19:28.404 --> 00:19:30.494
is dying in the Near East because of the advent

496
00:19:30.494 --> 00:19:33.685
of the Western world in the Near East.

497
00:19:33.685 --> 00:19:35.241
There's big changes that are occurring,

498
00:19:35.241 --> 00:19:36.638
and a lot of scholars don't study it,

499
00:19:36.638 --> 00:19:39.166
they study it from a book learning.

500
00:19:39.166 --> 00:19:42.067
I got it out of a living patriarch.

501
00:19:42.067 --> 00:19:44.371
Which makes a big difference.

502
00:19:44.371 --> 00:19:46.088
Not that the scholarly work

503
00:19:46.088 --> 00:19:48.511
in the language isn't good, it is.

504
00:19:48.511 --> 00:19:51.999
But unless you come from the Near East,

505
00:19:51.999 --> 00:19:53.356
they don't teach this.

506
00:19:53.356 --> 00:19:55.873
I know several Roman Catholic Aramaic scholars,

507
00:19:55.873 --> 00:19:57.772
when I was in Ireland, and they put me

508
00:19:57.772 --> 00:20:00.483
on the talk show,

509
00:20:00.483 --> 00:20:03.288
and they were coming from Aramaic.

510
00:20:03.288 --> 00:20:04.984
They had a Roman Catholic,

511
00:20:04.984 --> 00:20:06.840
who was considered number one

512
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.698
as an Aramaic scholar, but they said,

513
00:20:09.698 --> 00:20:12.205
how come he didn't say the things you're saying?

514
00:20:12.205 --> 00:20:14.178
I said, well what can I tell you,

515
00:20:14.178 --> 00:20:17.410
he just didn't have the tutoring that I had.

516
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.026
I was tutored by someone from the Near East,

517
00:20:20.026 --> 00:20:21.861
whose native tongue was Aramaic,

518
00:20:21.861 --> 00:20:24.794
and whose culture and way of thinking

519
00:20:24.794 --> 00:20:27.759
and acting and psychology and all that

520
00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:29.903
was the same as the ancient world.

521
00:20:29.903 --> 00:20:33.657
<v Regina>This is a really important factor here,</v>

522
00:20:33.657 --> 00:20:36.324
because we're running all this information

523
00:20:36.324 --> 00:20:37.977
in the King James Version of the Bible,

524
00:20:37.977 --> 00:20:39.044
and all these interpretations

525
00:20:39.044 --> 00:20:40.132
through our western mind.

526
00:20:40.132 --> 00:20:41.572
In fact, these were translated

527
00:20:41.572 --> 00:20:42.969
through a western mind.

528
00:20:42.969 --> 00:20:44.889
To go back to the original intention,

529
00:20:44.889 --> 00:20:47.017
you almost have to have the advantage

530
00:20:47.017 --> 00:20:49.641
of the kind of relationship that you had

531
00:20:49.641 --> 00:20:52.617
with your mentor to be able to grok this.

532
00:20:52.617 --> 00:20:54.356
Now let's start pulling out some of the

533
00:20:54.356 --> 00:20:57.737
common misperceptions, the most obvious

534
00:20:57.737 --> 00:21:01.492
popular, what you would say are misperceptions,

535
00:21:01.492 --> 00:21:03.882
that Christians today hold dear to them

536
00:21:03.882 --> 00:21:05.626
and will not relinquish.

537
00:21:05.626 --> 00:21:07.324
<v ->First of all, there's three things</v>

538
00:21:07.324 --> 00:21:09.024
we have mistaken ideas about

539
00:21:09.024 --> 00:21:10.602
that we use Scriptures on.

540
00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:11.672
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

541
00:21:12.212 --> 00:21:14.694
<v ->We have a mistaken idea about God,</v>

542
00:21:15.034 --> 00:21:16.954
and what God is.

543
00:21:16.954 --> 00:21:19.557
We have mistaken ideas about Jesus

544
00:21:19.557 --> 00:21:21.407
and his teachings.

545
00:21:21.775 --> 00:21:25.015
And we have a misunderstanding

546
00:21:25.015 --> 00:21:26.493
of what humanity is.

547
00:21:26.493 --> 00:21:30.071
Those three things are very vital and important.

548
00:21:30.071 --> 00:21:32.009
<v Regina>Yeah, I would say.</v>

549
00:21:32.009 --> 00:21:33.429
Let's start talking about,

550
00:21:33.429 --> 00:21:34.889
we talked a little bit about

551
00:21:34.889 --> 00:21:37.267
just the terminology in misperception of God,

552
00:21:37.267 --> 00:21:39.407
but let's talk about the misperception of God

553
00:21:39.407 --> 00:21:41.637
in an encapsulated way.

554
00:21:41.927 --> 00:21:44.605
<v ->First of all, what we misunderstand</v>

555
00:21:44.605 --> 00:21:48.313
is Jesus didn't change God into something else.

556
00:21:48.623 --> 00:21:51.723
We have to realize that all the perceptions of God

557
00:21:51.723 --> 00:21:54.023
mostly that we read in the Old Testaments

558
00:21:54.023 --> 00:21:55.911
are a mixed bag.

559
00:21:56.601 --> 00:21:59.189
What I mean by a mixed bag is

560
00:21:59.189 --> 00:22:01.557
some saw God as wrathful,

561
00:22:01.557 --> 00:22:03.757
some saw God as loving,

562
00:22:03.757 --> 00:22:06.425
some saw God as just chastising the people

563
00:22:06.425 --> 00:22:09.450
to bring them around,

564
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.784
and Jesus did not accept any of those

565
00:22:12.784 --> 00:22:14.832
concepts about God.

566
00:22:15.562 --> 00:22:18.010
This is why he used the term beloved.

567
00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:24.158
Jesus did not believe in using evil to fight evil.

568
00:22:24.158 --> 00:22:25.668
<v Regina>Right.</v>

569
00:22:26.236 --> 00:22:29.301
You're talking about a revolutionary, really.

570
00:22:29.301 --> 00:22:31.758
<v ->This is why Rome hated the early</v>

571
00:22:31.758 --> 00:22:34.294
movement under Jesus.

572
00:22:34.844 --> 00:22:39.392
Because they believed in might and force,

573
00:22:39.782 --> 00:22:41.660
which they were conquering the world,

574
00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.010
the Romans were.

575
00:22:44.918 --> 00:22:48.208
His teachings were contrary to force.

576
00:22:49.598 --> 00:22:52.718
Now Quakers and Mennonites

577
00:22:52.718 --> 00:22:55.077
go to an extreme.

578
00:22:55.077 --> 00:22:56.815
I mean, they keep themselves...

579
00:22:56.815 --> 00:22:59.175
They make it more of a how you dress,

580
00:22:59.175 --> 00:23:00.589
how you live,

581
00:23:00.589 --> 00:23:03.188
and against the modern world.

582
00:23:03.188 --> 00:23:05.686
But that's not what Jesus was talking about.

583
00:23:05.686 --> 00:23:09.246
He was talking about the inner sense of self,

584
00:23:09.246 --> 00:23:12.004
not the outer sense of self.

585
00:23:12.004 --> 00:23:13.102
It doesn't make a difference whether

586
00:23:13.102 --> 00:23:15.100
you have long hair or short hair.

587
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.020
Religion took up all these things,

588
00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.120
how you dress,

589
00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.938
how all of this thing is to be concerned.

590
00:23:19.938 --> 00:23:23.228
No, Jesus was concerned with the inward.

591
00:23:24.718 --> 00:23:27.474
<v Regina>In the Scriptures, known to be very,</v>

592
00:23:27.474 --> 00:23:29.954
not just tolerant, but very accepting of all,

593
00:23:29.954 --> 00:23:31.028
all people.

594
00:23:31.028 --> 00:23:32.186
<v ->Exactly.</v>

595
00:23:32.186 --> 00:23:34.626
Again, here is another concept,

596
00:23:34.626 --> 00:23:37.066
when Jesus sent his disciples out,

597
00:23:37.596 --> 00:23:40.345
and he teaching was, he tells them,

598
00:23:40.345 --> 00:23:43.635
now be perfect, even as your father in heaven is perfect.

599
00:23:44.325 --> 00:23:46.765
Again, it's translation.

600
00:23:46.765 --> 00:23:48.143
By using the word perfect,

601
00:23:48.143 --> 00:23:49.781
and it's not a bad translation

602
00:23:49.781 --> 00:23:51.481
to use the word perfect there,

603
00:23:51.481 --> 00:23:53.501
but when I use the word perfect in English,

604
00:23:53.501 --> 00:23:55.137
I have a different understanding of perfect

605
00:23:55.137 --> 00:23:57.775
than they did when that word was used.

606
00:23:57.775 --> 00:24:00.773
That word in Aramaic is gmeera,

607
00:24:00.773 --> 00:24:04.330
G-M-E-E-R-A,

608
00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:07.210
I always add an H for the ah sound,

609
00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:10.480
but there is no H there, just gmeera.

610
00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:16.538
What that means is, to be inclusive.

611
00:24:16.846 --> 00:24:18.196
<v Regina>Big difference.</v>

612
00:24:18.936 --> 00:24:20.920
<v ->This of course is, be inclusive,</v>

613
00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.660
even as your father in heaven is inclusive.

614
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.500
The reason why we know it has that shade of meaning,

615
00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.501
because it means maturity,

616
00:24:28.501 --> 00:24:31.990
it also means someone who is a jack of all trades,

617
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:35.154
these are the different meanings to the word.

618
00:24:35.154 --> 00:24:38.273
How do we know it meant to be inclusive

619
00:24:38.273 --> 00:24:40.312
is because he just got through saying

620
00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:43.750
that God lets his rain fall on the just and the unjust

621
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:46.950
and lets his sun shine on the good and the wicked.

622
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:49.060
Meaning God is not partial.

623
00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.914
Whereas you read partiality

624
00:24:50.914 --> 00:24:53.121
when you read the Old Testament.

625
00:24:53.121 --> 00:24:56.777
It's as if God chose a special people

626
00:24:56.777 --> 00:24:59.653
and that's it, no one else.

627
00:24:59.653 --> 00:25:01.193
This is the problem.

628
00:25:01.193 --> 00:25:03.573
People misunderstand that.

629
00:25:03.573 --> 00:25:05.293
Which, we'll get into the chosen in a minute,

630
00:25:05.293 --> 00:25:06.893
but let me get to this.

631
00:25:06.893 --> 00:25:08.753
Jesus taught he wanted his disciples

632
00:25:08.753 --> 00:25:12.733
to be open to everyone, be inclusive.

633
00:25:12.733 --> 00:25:16.473
But first you're to go to the Jewish people

634
00:25:16.473 --> 00:25:19.194
and the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

635
00:25:19.194 --> 00:25:21.013
Because they were ready for it,

636
00:25:21.013 --> 00:25:22.253
they were open for it.

637
00:25:22.253 --> 00:25:24.853
Romans and Greeks, they didn't care about it.

638
00:25:24.853 --> 00:25:27.551
But the other Semites, you had Arabs

639
00:25:27.551 --> 00:25:29.291
that were in existence then,

640
00:25:29.291 --> 00:25:31.971
you had Assyrians that were in existence,

641
00:25:31.971 --> 00:25:34.091
you had Syrians that were in existence,

642
00:25:34.091 --> 00:25:35.271
they weren't called Syrians,

643
00:25:35.271 --> 00:25:37.047
they were called Arameans.

644
00:25:37.047 --> 00:25:38.367
<v Regina>But historically, these were</v>

645
00:25:38.367 --> 00:25:39.527
all among the Semites?

646
00:25:39.527 --> 00:25:40.707
<v ->These were all Semites.</v>

647
00:25:40.707 --> 00:25:42.167
He had to go to them first.

648
00:25:42.167 --> 00:25:43.275
I mean, what did the Romans

649
00:25:43.275 --> 00:25:46.121
and Greeks care about Moses or any,

650
00:25:46.121 --> 00:25:47.501
they didn't care about that.

651
00:25:47.501 --> 00:25:47.879
<v Regina>That's true.</v>

652
00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:50.075
They were on power campaigns at the time.

653
00:25:50.075 --> 00:25:52.615
<v ->Yet, Paul writes to the Jew first,</v>

654
00:25:52.615 --> 00:25:53.793
and then the Greek.

655
00:25:53.793 --> 00:25:54.793
That's impossible.

656
00:25:54.793 --> 00:25:56.471
The Greek wasn't considered at all.

657
00:25:56.471 --> 00:25:58.189
That's a mistranslation.

658
00:25:58.189 --> 00:26:01.309
Aramaic texts doesn't say, to the Jew first,

659
00:26:01.309 --> 00:26:03.429
and then the Greeks,

660
00:26:03.429 --> 00:26:08.429
it says, to the Jews first and the Arameans,

661
00:26:08.499 --> 00:26:09.965
which meant the Syrian people,

662
00:26:09.965 --> 00:26:11.583
the other Semite groups.

663
00:26:11.583 --> 00:26:13.663
Because it's of the same culture.

664
00:26:13.663 --> 00:26:15.663
Roman culture, Greek culture

665
00:26:15.663 --> 00:26:20.081
was totally alien, as our culture is today

666
00:26:20.081 --> 00:26:22.799
to Islam in the Near East and their culture.

667
00:26:22.799 --> 00:26:24.199
They clash.

668
00:26:24.199 --> 00:26:26.379
Because of the way we're in another clash,

669
00:26:26.379 --> 00:26:29.089
like they did during the time of Jesus.

670
00:26:29.709 --> 00:26:31.495
We're in this clash,

671
00:26:31.495 --> 00:26:34.283
and this is what's creating this problem.

672
00:26:34.633 --> 00:26:36.053
But it was cultural.

673
00:26:37.363 --> 00:26:39.738
So it should be to the Arameans,

674
00:26:39.738 --> 00:26:41.598
not the Greeks,

675
00:26:41.598 --> 00:26:43.498
because they would understand Semitic language,

676
00:26:43.498 --> 00:26:44.998
they would understand the culture.

677
00:26:44.998 --> 00:26:47.778
The only difference between Jews and Syrians

678
00:26:47.778 --> 00:26:51.418
was the religion, not the culture.

679
00:26:53.048 --> 00:26:55.114
<v Regina>Let's talk about that.</v>

680
00:26:55.114 --> 00:26:57.373
What happened there?

681
00:26:57.373 --> 00:26:58.330
What happened in the split,

682
00:26:58.330 --> 00:26:59.348
in terms of the religion,

683
00:26:59.348 --> 00:27:01.106
the religious practices at that time?

684
00:27:01.106 --> 00:27:02.106
<v ->Once the Greeks did take up</v>

685
00:27:02.106 --> 00:27:05.066
with the teachings of Jesus, and all that,

686
00:27:05.066 --> 00:27:08.186
then a lot of Greek teachings came into it,

687
00:27:09.716 --> 00:27:12.242
and it polluted everything.

688
00:27:12.242 --> 00:27:13.980
It corrupted Jesus' teaching.

689
00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.168
It became something else.

690
00:27:15.168 --> 00:27:16.936
We developed a priesthood.

691
00:27:16.936 --> 00:27:19.667
That's what Jesus...

692
00:27:19.667 --> 00:27:21.965
<v Regina>He wasn't down with priesthood.</v>

693
00:27:21.965 --> 00:27:23.205
<v ->He was just a common people,</v>

694
00:27:23.205 --> 00:27:25.925
<v Regina>He wasn't down with churches.</v>

695
00:27:25.925 --> 00:27:27.593
<v ->He was a common man himself.</v>

696
00:27:31.413 --> 00:27:33.519
When the second century came on,

697
00:27:33.519 --> 00:27:35.467
Jesus became God.

698
00:27:36.097 --> 00:27:38.313
Well now where does that put us?

699
00:27:38.313 --> 00:27:40.633
We're supposed to imitate him?

700
00:27:40.633 --> 00:27:41.651
We're talking about God,

701
00:27:41.651 --> 00:27:43.679
how can you imitate God?

702
00:27:44.229 --> 00:27:46.407
Except mercy, the only way the Jewish people

703
00:27:46.407 --> 00:27:48.327
talk about imitating God, what they meant by that

704
00:27:48.327 --> 00:27:52.827
is mercy, compassion, love, understanding,

705
00:27:52.827 --> 00:27:55.317
enlightenment, that's what they mean.

706
00:27:55.627 --> 00:27:57.517
But when we use it,

707
00:27:57.517 --> 00:27:58.943
when Jesus said, the works that I do,

708
00:27:58.943 --> 00:28:00.763
you do also,

709
00:28:00.763 --> 00:28:02.641
well how can we?

710
00:28:02.641 --> 00:28:04.919
We weren't born like he was born.

711
00:28:04.919 --> 00:28:06.339
We took a mother and a father,

712
00:28:06.339 --> 00:28:08.315
and he didn't have one.

713
00:28:08.315 --> 00:28:10.285
<v Regina>Right, exactly.</v>

714
00:28:11.795 --> 00:28:14.155
<v ->He'd be like a duck telling a bunch of chickens</v>

715
00:28:14.155 --> 00:28:16.175
on how to swim, and a smart chicken

716
00:28:16.175 --> 00:28:18.536
would say to the duck that was teaching him,

717
00:28:18.536 --> 00:28:19.613
why don't you give us your webbed feet,

718
00:28:19.613 --> 00:28:21.843
and then we can learn how to swim.

719
00:28:22.283 --> 00:28:23.830
Because we were born without webbed feet

720
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.388
like you got in order to do the swimming.

721
00:28:26.388 --> 00:28:28.666
<v Regina>Yeah, and all the separation starts occurring.</v>

722
00:28:28.666 --> 00:28:31.646
<v ->These are the doctrines that have muddied</v>

723
00:28:32.236 --> 00:28:34.842
and darkened the teachings of Jesus,

724
00:28:34.842 --> 00:28:37.092
and we miss the major point.

725
00:28:37.442 --> 00:28:41.112
He came bringing a major shift into this world.

726
00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:42.578
<v Regina>A paradigm shift, as you call it.</v>

727
00:28:42.578 --> 00:28:43.876
<v ->A paradigm shift.</v>

728
00:28:43.876 --> 00:28:46.914
<v Regina>Tell us what a shift was to shift away from into.</v>

729
00:28:46.914 --> 00:28:49.184
<v ->From violence to love.</v>

730
00:28:49.534 --> 00:28:51.804
From violence to meekness.

731
00:28:52.314 --> 00:28:54.784
From hatred to love.

732
00:28:55.274 --> 00:28:56.673
This is the shift.

733
00:28:56.673 --> 00:28:58.293
So how do we make the shift?

734
00:28:58.293 --> 00:29:00.173
That's what he came to do.

735
00:29:00.173 --> 00:29:02.533
To teach us how to make this shift.

736
00:29:02.533 --> 00:29:05.831
Instead, it turned into, what do you believe?

737
00:29:05.831 --> 00:29:07.711
Do you believe in three gods or one God?

738
00:29:07.711 --> 00:29:09.291
Do you believe in three in one,

739
00:29:09.291 --> 00:29:11.319
or none, or what?

740
00:29:11.789 --> 00:29:13.475
We've lost the whole issue.

741
00:29:13.744 --> 00:29:15.403
<v Regina>The whole notion of inclusiveness,</v>

742
00:29:15.403 --> 00:29:17.543
then you get into exclusiveness,

743
00:29:17.543 --> 00:29:18.983
and we're talking, you mentioned this

744
00:29:18.983 --> 00:29:21.741
a little bit ago, about the chosen people at the time,

745
00:29:21.741 --> 00:29:25.161
that were chosen to seed a message

746
00:29:25.161 --> 00:29:28.121
among the Semitic people of the day,

747
00:29:28.121 --> 00:29:29.541
but that's been carried forward

748
00:29:29.541 --> 00:29:31.199
into a totally different way.

749
00:29:31.199 --> 00:29:31.697
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

750
00:29:31.697 --> 00:29:34.535
The word chosen has become misunderstood today.

751
00:29:34.535 --> 00:29:36.756
How I always use to say,

752
00:29:36.756 --> 00:29:38.515
when you look at chosen people,

753
00:29:38.515 --> 00:29:42.485
I use an illustration of water, running water.

754
00:29:43.515 --> 00:29:47.013
Like, why did God choose Abraham above everyone else?

755
00:29:47.013 --> 00:29:50.043
Why would he become so chosen?

756
00:29:50.813 --> 00:29:52.293
As if God sat there and thought a while,

757
00:29:52.293 --> 00:29:53.643
and said, that's a good one,

758
00:29:53.643 --> 00:29:55.521
I think I'll take this one.

759
00:29:55.791 --> 00:29:57.291
You're making God a human being,

760
00:29:57.291 --> 00:29:58.999
and God is not a human being,

761
00:29:59.869 --> 00:30:01.479
in that sense.

762
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:04.679
It's like water,

763
00:30:05.329 --> 00:30:07.519
fast, running water.

764
00:30:07.809 --> 00:30:08.809
If you get an obstacle,

765
00:30:08.809 --> 00:30:10.529
put it in the way of running water,

766
00:30:10.529 --> 00:30:12.749
what will the water do?

767
00:30:12.749 --> 00:30:13.589
<v Regina>It moves around.</v>

768
00:30:13.589 --> 00:30:15.749
<v ->It move around it, right?</v>

769
00:30:15.749 --> 00:30:20.089
But if there is an opening in this obstacle,

770
00:30:20.949 --> 00:30:22.233
where it can go through,

771
00:30:22.233 --> 00:30:24.823
the water would run through, right?

772
00:30:26.013 --> 00:30:26.833
What happened is,

773
00:30:26.833 --> 00:30:28.963
Abraham was open.

774
00:30:29.052 --> 00:30:30.949
The water ran through.

775
00:30:30.949 --> 00:30:33.307
When it comes out the other side,

776
00:30:33.307 --> 00:30:35.045
it's chosen.

777
00:30:35.045 --> 00:30:36.743
You understand what I'm saying?

778
00:30:36.743 --> 00:30:38.784
Because he was open,

779
00:30:38.784 --> 00:30:40.163
when it comes through,

780
00:30:40.163 --> 00:30:41.381
he's chosen.

781
00:30:41.381 --> 00:30:42.881
<v Regina>That's not necessarily a birthright</v>

782
00:30:42.881 --> 00:30:45.121
from that point forward, however.

783
00:30:45.121 --> 00:30:46.335
That was of the moment.

784
00:30:46.335 --> 00:30:47.685
<v ->That was at the moment.</v>

785
00:30:48.785 --> 00:30:52.063
That's why people missed the Abrahamic blessing.

786
00:30:52.393 --> 00:30:54.093
The Abrahamic blessing was

787
00:30:54.093 --> 00:30:56.813
I chose you because I favor you,

788
00:30:56.813 --> 00:30:58.452
no, no, no, no.

789
00:30:58.452 --> 00:31:02.491
I chose you, that through your family,

790
00:31:02.491 --> 00:31:04.371
through your descendants,

791
00:31:04.371 --> 00:31:08.241
all the families of the earth shall be blessed.

792
00:31:09.271 --> 00:31:12.561
<v Regina>Now that's quite a different interpretation.</v>

793
00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:14.070
<v ->That's right there in the Scriptures.</v>

794
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:15.390
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

795
00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:16.510
So there's that.

796
00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:18.230
<v ->But we don't pay attention to that.</v>

797
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:19.729
<v Regina>No, we don't pay attention to that.</v>

798
00:31:19.729 --> 00:31:24.729
It's a very interesting, distinguishing remark

799
00:31:24.988 --> 00:31:26.638
that you made there.

800
00:31:27.408 --> 00:31:30.158
Now let's talk about the whole notion of sin.

801
00:31:30.908 --> 00:31:34.209
Again, we're talking about exclusiveness.

802
00:31:34.209 --> 00:31:36.548
You're a sinner, you're not a sinner

803
00:31:36.548 --> 00:31:37.788
because you do some things,

804
00:31:37.788 --> 00:31:40.648
maybe because you kiss your boyfriend

805
00:31:40.648 --> 00:31:42.527
or have sex before you're married,

806
00:31:42.527 --> 00:31:45.407
or whatever it is throughout history,

807
00:31:45.407 --> 00:31:48.447
that have made people go into great shame about themselves,

808
00:31:48.447 --> 00:31:49.787
these were not part

809
00:31:49.787 --> 00:31:53.327
of the teachings of Jesus at that time,

810
00:31:53.327 --> 00:31:55.953
as being accepting of all, was it?

811
00:31:55.953 --> 00:31:57.413
<v ->First of all, you've you've gotta keep Jesus</v>

812
00:31:57.413 --> 00:31:59.332
in his original setting.

813
00:31:59.332 --> 00:32:00.312
<v Regina>Right.</v>

814
00:32:00.312 --> 00:32:02.092
In the Near Eastern setting, that's true.

815
00:32:02.092 --> 00:32:02.972
<v ->In the Near Eastern setting,</v>

816
00:32:02.972 --> 00:32:06.380
with the Semitic culture, and with the Jewish teachings,

817
00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:10.410
because definitely, even though he was revolutionary,

818
00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:14.429
his religion was definitely of the Jewish faith.

819
00:32:14.429 --> 00:32:16.108
<v Regina>Right, so he was living within that.</v>

820
00:32:16.108 --> 00:32:16.747
Okay.

821
00:32:16.747 --> 00:32:18.887
<v ->He was living within that matrix.</v>

822
00:32:18.887 --> 00:32:22.376
That's why, certain things, he never got into.

823
00:32:23.216 --> 00:32:26.931
But if someone had

824
00:32:26.931 --> 00:32:28.931
committed a sexual act,

825
00:32:28.931 --> 00:32:32.541
and of course, they would become pregnant,

826
00:32:32.981 --> 00:32:34.551
he forgave them.

827
00:32:34.551 --> 00:32:35.149
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

828
00:32:35.149 --> 00:32:36.969
<v ->Which, under the Mosaic law,</v>

829
00:32:36.969 --> 00:32:38.829
she should've been stoned to death,

830
00:32:38.829 --> 00:32:40.189
and whoever had slept with her

831
00:32:40.189 --> 00:32:42.227
should have been stoned to death.

832
00:32:42.227 --> 00:32:43.485
<v Regina>A little harsh.</v>

833
00:32:43.485 --> 00:32:45.286
But he's saying no.

834
00:32:45.286 --> 00:32:48.235
<v ->When he sat down and he drew,</v>

835
00:32:49.315 --> 00:32:51.553
or made geometric figures,

836
00:32:51.553 --> 00:32:53.073
it was the temple floor,

837
00:32:53.073 --> 00:32:54.813
there was no way you could make...

838
00:32:54.813 --> 00:32:56.911
He was contemplating.

839
00:32:56.911 --> 00:32:58.129
That's what they do in the Near East.

840
00:32:58.129 --> 00:33:01.287
Today they use those worry beads,

841
00:33:01.287 --> 00:33:03.727
but in the ancient world,

842
00:33:03.727 --> 00:33:04.525
they would just do this.

843
00:33:04.525 --> 00:33:06.185
Like when you're on the phone

844
00:33:06.185 --> 00:33:07.545
and you're doodling,

845
00:33:07.545 --> 00:33:09.435
he was doodling.

846
00:33:10.365 --> 00:33:12.045
Because he was thinking.

847
00:33:12.045 --> 00:33:14.113
Because they had faced him with a problem.

848
00:33:15.223 --> 00:33:16.723
What do you do about this woman?

849
00:33:16.723 --> 00:33:19.543
Because the culture and the religion says

850
00:33:19.543 --> 00:33:23.597
she needs to be stoned to death.

851
00:33:23.597 --> 00:33:25.657
Of course, they didn't bring the guy who slept with her,

852
00:33:25.657 --> 00:33:28.837
but they brought her.

853
00:33:28.837 --> 00:33:29.794
(laughter)

854
00:33:29.794 --> 00:33:31.644
<v Regina>Still happens today, yeah.</v>

855
00:33:33.554 --> 00:33:34.894
<v ->Jesus thought about it,</v>

856
00:33:34.894 --> 00:33:37.244
and then he came to a conclusion,

857
00:33:37.244 --> 00:33:38.611
and he says, he that is without sin,

858
00:33:38.611 --> 00:33:40.411
let him throw the first stone.

859
00:33:40.411 --> 00:33:41.911
Meaning that some of these men

860
00:33:41.911 --> 00:33:43.539
had slept with that woman.

861
00:33:44.836 --> 00:33:46.944
Not what Cecil B. DeMille did,

862
00:33:46.944 --> 00:33:48.828
and said the murderer, thief,

863
00:33:48.828 --> 00:33:49.686
none of that.

864
00:33:49.686 --> 00:33:51.926
In other words, these men were guilty

865
00:33:51.926 --> 00:33:54.764
and of course, the Scriptures are exaggerated,

866
00:33:54.764 --> 00:33:56.424
like there was a whole crowd that brought her,

867
00:33:56.424 --> 00:33:58.404
but probably three of four men

868
00:33:58.404 --> 00:34:01.152
who hated what Jesus had to say.

869
00:34:03.458 --> 00:34:05.617
What they did then is,

870
00:34:05.617 --> 00:34:07.217
when he said, he who is without sin

871
00:34:07.217 --> 00:34:08.217
let him throw the first stone,

872
00:34:08.217 --> 00:34:09.072
they all left.

873
00:34:09.072 --> 00:34:11.032
It was up to him as a prophet,

874
00:34:11.032 --> 00:34:15.612
and as a follower of the religion of the Mosaic faith,

875
00:34:16.172 --> 00:34:20.187
he said, woman where are your accusers?

876
00:34:20.187 --> 00:34:23.103
She says, they are gone, my Lord.

877
00:34:23.103 --> 00:34:26.102
He says, now go,

878
00:34:27.002 --> 00:34:28.698
and don't do it again.

879
00:34:28.698 --> 00:34:31.295
<v Regina>Don't put me in this situation again.</v>

880
00:34:31.295 --> 00:34:33.470
<v ->Don't do it for yourself.</v>

881
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:37.506
So she wouldn't be dragged off and stoned.

882
00:34:37.506 --> 00:34:39.740
Absolutely, he was for her, but he forgave her.

883
00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:41.540
<v Regina>You're talking about a peacemaker.</v>

884
00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.295
Essentially, everything, it was inclusiveness...

885
00:34:43.295 --> 00:34:45.575
<v ->He brought everything into harmony,</v>

886
00:34:45.575 --> 00:34:47.695
he brought life to that woman.

887
00:34:47.695 --> 00:34:49.475
She should've been stoned to death,

888
00:34:49.475 --> 00:34:52.155
according to the religious dictates,

889
00:34:52.155 --> 00:34:54.935
but he brought salvation to her.

890
00:34:54.935 --> 00:34:56.645
That's salvation.

891
00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:59.250
Not what we think of salvation today.

892
00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:01.106
But that was salvation to her.

893
00:35:01.106 --> 00:35:02.709
Then he warned her,

894
00:35:02.709 --> 00:35:05.689
for her sake, don't do it again.

895
00:35:05.689 --> 00:35:08.129
Don't sin again means, don't put yourself

896
00:35:08.129 --> 00:35:10.349
in that position where you're gonna be

897
00:35:10.349 --> 00:35:12.309
thrown into it.

898
00:35:13.719 --> 00:35:15.712
They'll drag you off, and you'll have

899
00:35:15.712 --> 00:35:17.362
to find something else.

900
00:35:17.792 --> 00:35:20.052
Of course, scholars say that story is made up.

901
00:35:20.052 --> 00:35:22.972
Well, well, whether it's made up or not,

902
00:35:22.972 --> 00:35:24.262
it has the same meaning.

903
00:35:24.912 --> 00:35:25.910
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

904
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:27.070
<v ->I'm talking about</v>

905
00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:29.682
what our modern scholars here in the States

906
00:35:29.682 --> 00:35:31.442
and Europe have done,

907
00:35:31.442 --> 00:35:33.622
is they're completely making everything

908
00:35:33.622 --> 00:35:36.252
in the Bible not true.

909
00:35:37.002 --> 00:35:38.380
Which is a shame.

910
00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:41.750
Some of it, yes, has been added by scribes.

911
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:43.690
But they're throwing everything out.

912
00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:46.130
For a while, they didn't believe Jesus existed.

913
00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:48.818
Now they say, oh yes, now he existed.

914
00:35:49.568 --> 00:35:50.848
What they're gonna do is destroy

915
00:35:50.848 --> 00:35:52.958
one of the greatest teachings

916
00:35:52.958 --> 00:35:55.954
and teacher, worst than the crucifixion,

917
00:35:56.904 --> 00:35:58.722
by putting him on the cross.

918
00:35:58.722 --> 00:35:59.762
Because by putting him on the cross,

919
00:35:59.762 --> 00:36:01.730
his words spread more.

920
00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.480
When you say, he didn't exist,

921
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.160
his teachings don't mean anything,

922
00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.340
this is made up, and that is made up,

923
00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.010
you're destroying the whole thing.

924
00:36:09.798 --> 00:36:11.798
<v Regina>The truth is, we're coming into a</v>

925
00:36:11.798 --> 00:36:14.698
period of history, had we embraced...

926
00:36:16.818 --> 00:36:20.444
those teachings of love thy neighbor

927
00:36:20.444 --> 00:36:22.684
as you love thyself,

928
00:36:22.684 --> 00:36:26.044
of including all and not excluding,

929
00:36:26.044 --> 00:36:28.065
and not setting ourselves apart

930
00:36:28.065 --> 00:36:30.224
from each other as one more special than the other,

931
00:36:30.224 --> 00:36:34.004
had we embraced these concepts

932
00:36:34.004 --> 00:36:35.504
and taken them to heart

933
00:36:35.504 --> 00:36:37.084
a couple thousand years ago,

934
00:36:37.084 --> 00:36:39.244
or even today, we'd be a lot further along

935
00:36:39.244 --> 00:36:40.804
in our human evolution.

936
00:36:40.804 --> 00:36:41.544
<v ->We would.</v>

937
00:36:41.544 --> 00:36:43.064
That was the whole purpose of it.

938
00:36:43.064 --> 00:36:45.884
Jesus came to move us into a new

939
00:36:45.884 --> 00:36:48.754
stage of consciousness.

940
00:36:48.782 --> 00:36:51.762
Into a new era, bring humankind into a new era.

941
00:36:51.762 --> 00:36:53.460
But all of his teachings got polluted.

942
00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:55.020
His teachings are dangerous

943
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:58.049
because it's dangerous to make this shift.

944
00:36:58.798 --> 00:37:00.198
<v Regina>Dangerous to whom?</v>

945
00:37:00.198 --> 00:37:02.748
<v ->To the one who teaches it and practices it.</v>

946
00:37:02.796 --> 00:37:03.926
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

947
00:37:04.626 --> 00:37:06.512
<v ->I'll give you an example,</v>

948
00:37:06.512 --> 00:37:08.162
a modern example.

949
00:37:08.712 --> 00:37:12.372
Leo Tolstoy wrote a book called,

950
00:37:12.372 --> 00:37:15.112
first book his published was in 1884,

951
00:37:15.112 --> 00:37:16.162
do I have time for this?

952
00:37:16.162 --> 00:37:16.908
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

953
00:37:16.908 --> 00:37:18.328
<v ->In 1884,</v>

954
00:37:18.818 --> 00:37:22.658
which was what he believed,

955
00:37:22.658 --> 00:37:24.370
and it was published.

956
00:37:24.375 --> 00:37:25.735
It wasn't a novel.

957
00:37:25.735 --> 00:37:27.105
It was what he believed.

958
00:37:27.391 --> 00:37:31.405
It was so revolutionary, the Russian government banned it.

959
00:37:31.405 --> 00:37:32.666
<v Regina>What did he believe?</v>

960
00:37:32.666 --> 00:37:33.565
What was the content?

961
00:37:33.565 --> 00:37:34.256
<v ->Wait a minute,</v>

962
00:37:34.256 --> 00:37:36.946
it's the second one that became the controversy.

963
00:37:38.276 --> 00:37:41.386
It did spread into other languages, that book.

964
00:37:43.906 --> 00:37:46.116
The church got after him,

965
00:37:46.116 --> 00:37:47.756
and the state got after him.

966
00:37:47.756 --> 00:37:49.016
So he wrote another book,

967
00:37:49.016 --> 00:37:52.716
as a rebuttal against all this 10 years later.

968
00:37:53.786 --> 00:37:57.717
It was actually 1893, about nine years,

969
00:37:57.997 --> 00:38:01.348
but it never got published in Russian.

970
00:38:02.799 --> 00:38:04.578
It only stayed in manuscript form

971
00:38:04.578 --> 00:38:06.419
because the Russian government

972
00:38:06.419 --> 00:38:10.409
considered his first book as bad and banned.

973
00:38:11.338 --> 00:38:12.759
So the second book,

974
00:38:12.759 --> 00:38:16.558
which was on the teachings of Jesus,

975
00:38:16.558 --> 00:38:20.968
and he called it The Kingdom of God is Within You.

976
00:38:22.658 --> 00:38:25.579
He took all the teachings of Jesus...

977
00:38:25.959 --> 00:38:29.865
Because it's a rebuttal against all the things

978
00:38:29.865 --> 00:38:33.414
he said in the first book.

979
00:38:33.984 --> 00:38:35.440
I have not read the first book.

980
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.731
<v Regina>This was a book of self empowerment?</v>

981
00:38:38.271 --> 00:38:39.510
<v ->Empowering the individual.</v>

982
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:41.275
<v Regina>Exactly, self empowerment.</v>

983
00:38:44.165 --> 00:38:46.020
<v ->But based all on Jesus' teaching.</v>

984
00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.430
<v Regina>I hear you.</v>

985
00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:52.595
<v ->What he did then, was after he did that,</v>

986
00:38:52.595 --> 00:38:55.636
and they wouldn't publish it in Russian,

987
00:38:55.636 --> 00:38:58.115
it went into Germany, got published in German,

988
00:38:58.115 --> 00:39:01.330
but then it got published into English

989
00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:03.150
this was 1894.

990
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:05.870
Then it got down to South Africa,

991
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:09.949
and went to this barrister

992
00:39:09.949 --> 00:39:11.684
by the name of Gandhi.

993
00:39:11.684 --> 00:39:12.555
(laughter)

994
00:39:12.555 --> 00:39:13.798
<v Regina>A young barrister?</v>

995
00:39:13.798 --> 00:39:14.948
<v ->Right.</v>

996
00:39:14.948 --> 00:39:18.572
When he read it, it was revolutionary to him.

997
00:39:20.382 --> 00:39:22.588
He didn’t do anything about it at first.

998
00:39:22.588 --> 00:39:25.248
But when he kept getting pushed,

999
00:39:25.248 --> 00:39:28.999
and shoved back because of his skin color,

1000
00:39:29.388 --> 00:39:33.458
even in South Africa because the British were in there.

1001
00:39:35.128 --> 00:39:36.784
Because of that,

1002
00:39:38.494 --> 00:39:39.554
and he went back to India,

1003
00:39:39.554 --> 00:39:42.909
that’s when he began to step out,

1004
00:39:42.909 --> 00:39:46.200
to enact, to actualize

1005
00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:50.315
what Tolstoy wrote in his book.

1006
00:39:50.315 --> 00:39:54.050
Tolstoy, himself, was thrilled.

1007
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:56.959
Ghandi had written Tolstoy.

1008
00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:00.479
Tolstoy died in 1910.

1009
00:40:01.389 --> 00:40:03.789
Tolstoy at least got one letter,

1010
00:40:03.789 --> 00:40:06.215
and he wrote one letter back to Gandhi,

1011
00:40:07.026 --> 00:40:10.960
and told him that he was glad and what was happening.

1012
00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.640
But Tolstoy never acted on it himself,

1013
00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.080
and he felt bad about it,

1014
00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.580
he even wrote about it.

1015
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:21.166
He says, I feel like such a hypocrite.

1016
00:40:21.166 --> 00:40:22.145
<v Regina>Yet at the same time,</v>

1017
00:40:22.145 --> 00:40:25.241
in Russia, Carl Marx’ work was then after this…

1018
00:40:25.241 --> 00:40:26.242
<v ->Carl Marx’ work was…</v>

1019
00:40:26.242 --> 00:40:28.292
and that’s why he wrote it,

1020
00:40:28.302 --> 00:40:31.097
against Carl Marx’ communism.

1021
00:40:31.827 --> 00:40:35.613
But also against the rule of the Czar and the state

1022
00:40:35.613 --> 00:40:37.947
because of what they were doing,

1023
00:40:37.947 --> 00:40:41.129
The cruelty of governmental officials.

1024
00:40:41.129 --> 00:40:42.559
Period.

1025
00:40:42.945 --> 00:40:45.461
<v Regina>And sectarianism as a form of worship.</v>

1026
00:40:45.461 --> 00:40:46.840
<v ->At the church, too.</v>

1027
00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.156
He had the whole thing in there.

1028
00:40:49.156 --> 00:40:52.432
But he used Jesus’ teachings.

1029
00:40:52.432 --> 00:40:55.046
This is why they’re dangerous and subversive.

1030
00:40:55.046 --> 00:40:56.887
<v Regina>Because it takes power away from all</v>

1031
00:40:56.887 --> 00:40:58.963
the existing dogmas and structures

1032
00:40:58.963 --> 00:41:00.177
that have been built around it.

1033
00:41:00.177 --> 00:41:01.628
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1034
00:41:02.574 --> 00:41:05.184
But Gandhi acted on it.

1035
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.764
Of course, he lost his life.

1036
00:41:07.764 --> 00:41:10.060
Eventually, I mean, he won.

1037
00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.946
I call it, he used the weapons of the soul,

1038
00:41:13.835 --> 00:41:17.911
love, compassion, understanding, and non resistance.

1039
00:41:17.911 --> 00:41:21.228
That was the key, non resistance to evil.

1040
00:41:21.228 --> 00:41:22.958
Though the evil comes against you,

1041
00:41:22.958 --> 00:41:24.929
don’t combat it.

1042
00:41:25.234 --> 00:41:26.490
Don’t combat it.

1043
00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:28.309
Then of course, you know who took that up again

1044
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:29.882
here in the States

1045
00:41:29.882 --> 00:41:32.321
was Martin Luther King, Jr.

1046
00:41:32.811 --> 00:41:34.547
and he followed a lot of the things there,

1047
00:41:34.547 --> 00:41:37.686
but it all stems from Tolstoy

1048
00:41:37.686 --> 00:41:41.106
making practical, some of it wasn’t too practical,

1049
00:41:41.106 --> 00:41:44.541
but he did make practical the teachings of Jesus

1050
00:41:44.541 --> 00:41:47.836
which were so revolutionary.

1051
00:41:47.836 --> 00:41:49.716
<v Regina>This notion,</v>

1052
00:41:49.716 --> 00:41:52.596
you said quite a few minutes ago now,

1053
00:41:52.596 --> 00:41:56.295
you talked about this embracing of the meek,

1054
00:41:56.295 --> 00:41:59.394
and the meek, this is a big one right now,

1055
00:41:59.394 --> 00:42:03.718
because the Western world has been grown on

1056
00:42:03.718 --> 00:42:06.759
and fed on the notion of competition,

1057
00:42:06.759 --> 00:42:09.279
strength, the man that can work the hardest,

1058
00:42:09.279 --> 00:42:10.419
make the most money.

1059
00:42:10.419 --> 00:42:12.178
Now, the woman that can work the hardest,

1060
00:42:12.178 --> 00:42:14.139
rise the cooperate ladder and so forth,

1061
00:42:14.139 --> 00:42:16.038
has the power, holds the power,

1062
00:42:16.038 --> 00:42:19.458
and only the powerful seem to inherit anything,

1063
00:42:19.458 --> 00:42:20.618
it would appear.

1064
00:42:20.618 --> 00:42:22.538
Let’s talk that phrase.

1065
00:42:22.538 --> 00:42:25.299
<v ->They inherit all right, they inherit the wind.</v>

1066
00:42:25.299 --> 00:42:28.339
<v Regina>Let’s talk about the original phrase</v>

1067
00:42:28.339 --> 00:42:31.068
in the Aramaic text,

1068
00:42:31.068 --> 00:42:32.625
and the meek shall inherit the earth,

1069
00:42:32.625 --> 00:42:34.305
what does that mean?

1070
00:42:34.855 --> 00:42:38.496
<v ->The word meek (speaks in foreign language)</v>

1071
00:42:38.496 --> 00:42:43.412
in Aramaic means someone who is pliable, bendable.

1072
00:42:43.412 --> 00:42:44.189
<v Regina>Flexible.</v>

1073
00:42:44.189 --> 00:42:46.494
<v ->Flexible, exactly.</v>

1074
00:42:48.094 --> 00:42:50.389
This teaching was not new.

1075
00:42:50.389 --> 00:42:53.708
It was in the Hebrew Bible.

1076
00:42:53.708 --> 00:42:56.785
But what Jesus did, is he called on the meek.

1077
00:42:56.785 --> 00:42:58.985
He was recruiting them for

1078
00:42:58.985 --> 00:43:01.603
<v Regina>The open-minded, shall we say?</v>

1079
00:43:01.603 --> 00:43:04.281
That could embrace new philosophies and ideas.

1080
00:43:04.281 --> 00:43:06.061
<v ->Right.</v>

1081
00:43:06.061 --> 00:43:07.321
<v Regina>So what does this mean,</v>

1082
00:43:07.321 --> 00:43:09.731
the meek shall inherit the earth?

1083
00:43:09.965 --> 00:43:14.514
<v ->The meek, because they brought peace and peacemakers.</v>

1084
00:43:15.325 --> 00:43:18.622
They didn’t go to lawyers, they went to peacemakers.

1085
00:43:18.622 --> 00:43:21.359
The peacemakers stayed outside the city.

1086
00:43:21.359 --> 00:43:22.238
In fact, I’ll never forget,

1087
00:43:22.238 --> 00:43:26.938
one time I was lecturing in Northern California, in Fremont,

1088
00:43:26.938 --> 00:43:28.718
and when I was there lecturing,

1089
00:43:28.718 --> 00:43:30.777
I was talking about peacemakers

1090
00:43:30.777 --> 00:43:33.742
and there was a woman from Lebanon there

1091
00:43:33.742 --> 00:43:34.842
and she stopped me,

1092
00:43:34.842 --> 00:43:36.901
she said now hold it a second,

1093
00:43:36.901 --> 00:43:40.250
we still have these peacemakers in Lebanon.

1094
00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:43.645
We’d rather go to them than to the lawyers.

1095
00:43:43.645 --> 00:43:45.261
(laughs)

1096
00:43:45.261 --> 00:43:47.766
<v Regina>Well yeah, can we all on them in a larger sense,</v>

1097
00:43:47.766 --> 00:43:50.106
right now we need them.

1098
00:43:50.106 --> 00:43:52.906
<v ->She said, they didn’t charge us,</v>

1099
00:43:52.906 --> 00:43:55.051
and we gave them what we could.

1100
00:43:55.056 --> 00:43:56.996
They brought peace, they settled problems

1101
00:43:56.996 --> 00:43:59.599
they did all these different things.

1102
00:43:59.599 --> 00:44:02.548
<v Regina>Kind of like a loving mediator.</v>

1103
00:44:02.548 --> 00:44:04.413
<v ->That's fair to all sides,</v>

1104
00:44:04.413 --> 00:44:08.205
that judges and sees both sides of the picture.

1105
00:44:08.205 --> 00:44:10.324
Those are the peacemakers.

1106
00:44:10.324 --> 00:44:13.509
Those who are meek are those who are pliable.

1107
00:44:13.509 --> 00:44:17.109
In other words, when the storms come, you bend with it,

1108
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:22.109
so when the storms leave, you can go back up.

1109
00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:24.575
This is what Jesus was talking about.

1110
00:44:24.575 --> 00:44:28.565
He was not just talking about it, he was recruiting them.

1111
00:44:29.495 --> 00:44:31.299
If you were a meek person, you were sitting there,

1112
00:44:31.299 --> 00:44:34.893
and he said blessed at the meek, he had you.

1113
00:44:35.243 --> 00:44:35.895
He got you right away.

1114
00:44:35.895 --> 00:44:38.854
He said, this is what the Kingdom is about.

1115
00:44:38.854 --> 00:44:39.970
<v Regina>Let’s talk about this kingdom.</v>

1116
00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:42.319
This Kingdom isn’t, as you started to say

1117
00:44:42.319 --> 00:44:44.846
very early in our conversation,

1118
00:44:44.846 --> 00:44:48.239
he did not consider it to be an external as you say.

1119
00:44:48.239 --> 00:44:51.699
<v ->No, this is all internal, but expressed externally.</v>

1120
00:44:51.699 --> 00:44:53.937
<v Regina>Okay, let’s talk about what that means.</v>

1121
00:44:53.937 --> 00:44:57.836
<v ->Because most kingdoms are based on legislation.</v>

1122
00:44:57.836 --> 00:45:01.095
This is based on the inner condition of the heart,

1123
00:45:01.095 --> 00:45:04.955
on the emotions that get deep into man.

1124
00:45:05.795 --> 00:45:08.252
If you strictly go, like the law,

1125
00:45:08.252 --> 00:45:10.032
the law said,

1126
00:45:10.032 --> 00:45:14.234
she’s an adulteress, stone her to death.

1127
00:45:14.903 --> 00:45:16.562
Jesus went behind the law.

1128
00:45:16.562 --> 00:45:18.261
No, no, this is a human being.

1129
00:45:18.261 --> 00:45:20.909
This human being made a mistake.

1130
00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:24.882
I tried to prevent her by saying don’t do it again

1131
00:45:24.882 --> 00:45:27.700
so you’re not brought into a problem.

1132
00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:33.510
What he did is go behind the law

1133
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:35.111
and said no.

1134
00:45:35.111 --> 00:45:37.936
Because the law said, that’s legislation.

1135
00:45:37.936 --> 00:45:42.016
It was a religious legislation, definitely religious.

1136
00:45:42.746 --> 00:45:47.746
But still legislation, and she should be stoned to death,

1137
00:45:48.495 --> 00:45:51.002
but he went beyond it and said no,

1138
00:45:51.002 --> 00:45:53.370
this is a human being, she has a right to live,

1139
00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:56.858
she made a mistake, she needs to live.

1140
00:45:56.858 --> 00:45:57.618
<v Regina>The kingdom...</v>

1141
00:45:57.618 --> 00:46:01.078
The kingdom is, you see the difference between a legislation

1142
00:46:01.078 --> 00:46:03.878
and a coming from here, from the heart.

1143
00:46:03.878 --> 00:46:07.828
<v Regina>It seems that it is more of an integration</v>

1144
00:46:07.828 --> 00:46:10.227
of your spiritual world into the heart,

1145
00:46:10.227 --> 00:46:12.276
and then expressing that through your own life.

1146
00:46:12.276 --> 00:46:12.996
<v ->Right.</v>

1147
00:46:12.996 --> 00:46:17.996
<v Regina>So you hold that authority within you,</v>

1148
00:46:19.442 --> 00:46:22.384
the understandings and authority within you, right?

1149
00:46:22.664 --> 00:46:23.728
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1150
00:46:23.728 --> 00:46:27.632
<v Regina>That’s what you’re saying that Jesus’ message was</v>

1151
00:46:27.632 --> 00:46:30.505
is that you carry this within you.

1152
00:46:30.505 --> 00:46:32.985
It's not an external.

1153
00:46:34.015 --> 00:46:36.980
<v ->I call it the latent forces</v>

1154
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:40.475
that are in every human heart,

1155
00:46:40.475 --> 00:46:43.515
even those who have gone astray,

1156
00:46:43.515 --> 00:46:45.574
those forces are still there,

1157
00:46:45.574 --> 00:46:48.286
it’s just that certain conditions

1158
00:46:48.286 --> 00:46:50.977
brought them into that other sphere.

1159
00:46:50.986 --> 00:46:54.789
Into doing evil, or something like that.

1160
00:46:55.099 --> 00:46:59.299
But the latent forces of love, meakness,

1161
00:46:59.299 --> 00:47:02.727
peacemaking, joy, harmony,

1162
00:47:02.727 --> 00:47:04.705
it’s in every human being.

1163
00:47:04.705 --> 00:47:06.845
<v Regina>When you listen to the messages of today,</v>

1164
00:47:06.845 --> 00:47:09.322
for example, at this conference we're attending

1165
00:47:09.322 --> 00:47:11.261
here in Sedona,

1166
00:47:11.261 --> 00:47:13.691
this is the central theme of the times.

1167
00:47:14.481 --> 00:47:16.701
Everyone has the message.

1168
00:47:18.251 --> 00:47:20.608
People have different ideas of the path

1169
00:47:20.608 --> 00:47:22.509
and how you go there,

1170
00:47:22.509 --> 00:47:26.288
but the bottom line is this is the message of the time.

1171
00:47:26.288 --> 00:47:31.229
We have to recover that kingdom of deep love,

1172
00:47:31.229 --> 00:47:33.046
and spirituality, generosity,

1173
00:47:33.046 --> 00:47:35.006
non judgement within ourselves,

1174
00:47:35.006 --> 00:47:37.713
if we’re going to recover the larger human condition.

1175
00:47:37.713 --> 00:47:38.914
<v ->That’s the only way we’re going to recover.</v>

1176
00:47:38.914 --> 00:47:41.753
We will never have peace, I'll guarantee you,

1177
00:47:41.753 --> 00:47:44.213
no government on this earth, including our own,

1178
00:47:44.213 --> 00:47:46.593
and I love our United States,

1179
00:47:46.593 --> 00:47:50.733
but no government is gonna bring peace to the world.

1180
00:47:50.733 --> 00:47:53.946
It takes you and me and rest of the people

1181
00:47:53.946 --> 00:47:55.766
to bring peace to the world.

1182
00:47:55.766 --> 00:47:57.865
Just like, I’m in the State of Georgia,

1183
00:47:57.865 --> 00:48:01.377
you have bigotry, hatred, prejudice,

1184
00:48:01.377 --> 00:48:03.596
and we’ve got a lot of churches there.

1185
00:48:03.596 --> 00:48:06.556
But they haven’t solved the problem of bigotry,

1186
00:48:06.556 --> 00:48:09.079
hated, and prejudice

1187
00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:12.910
against any people of another faith

1188
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:14.429
or of another color,

1189
00:48:14.429 --> 00:48:17.039
or of another form of thinking.

1190
00:48:17.247 --> 00:48:18.707
This is what the church came to do,

1191
00:48:18.707 --> 00:48:20.467
to bring heaven on earth.

1192
00:48:20.467 --> 00:48:21.747
That’s what Jesus came to do,

1193
00:48:21.747 --> 00:48:23.166
bring heaven on earth.

1194
00:48:23.166 --> 00:48:25.427
Instead the church represents

1195
00:48:25.427 --> 00:48:27.787
the same thing the rest of the world represents.

1196
00:48:27.787 --> 00:48:29.063
Competition.

1197
00:48:30.153 --> 00:48:31.803
How I can get ahead.

1198
00:48:32.293 --> 00:48:35.468
What must I do to step higher,

1199
00:48:35.468 --> 00:48:37.998
and that may meaning stepping on you.

1200
00:48:37.998 --> 00:48:39.543
You know what I mean?

1201
00:48:39.543 --> 00:48:41.663
We’ve lost it.

1202
00:48:42.063 --> 00:48:44.253
The church is supposed to represent that.

1203
00:48:44.253 --> 00:48:46.153
Instead, they have a hierarchy

1204
00:48:46.153 --> 00:48:48.503
just like all the other systems do.

1205
00:48:48.503 --> 00:48:51.443
Jesus did not have a hierarchy.

1206
00:48:51.443 --> 00:48:53.383
Even though he chose twelve,

1207
00:48:53.383 --> 00:48:56.503
because the community was gathering around them.

1208
00:48:56.503 --> 00:48:59.549
But they weren’t vying for leadership.

1209
00:48:59.549 --> 00:49:00.327
They weren’t vying,

1210
00:49:00.327 --> 00:49:01.747
if you read the book of Acts,

1211
00:49:01.747 --> 00:49:03.187
they weren’t vying for leadership.

1212
00:49:03.187 --> 00:49:05.327
One time it’s Peter, one time it’s James.

1213
00:49:05.327 --> 00:49:09.897
In fact, James, the brother of Jesus, who despised him,

1214
00:49:10.827 --> 00:49:14.537
before he was crucified, became the head of the church.

1215
00:49:15.467 --> 00:49:20.295
I’m talking about James the half brother of Jesus.

1216
00:49:21.526 --> 00:49:23.425
He became the head of the church.

1217
00:49:23.425 --> 00:49:26.335
He wasn’t even one of the twelve,

1218
00:49:26.335 --> 00:49:28.573
but he became the head.

1219
00:49:29.264 --> 00:49:32.404
If these men were vying for leaderships

1220
00:49:32.404 --> 00:49:37.095
and for hey, I’m the head man here, I’m the honcho

1221
00:49:38.385 --> 00:49:39.463
<v Regina>When you're talking about,</v>

1222
00:49:39.463 --> 00:49:41.283
as you call it, churchiosity,

1223
00:49:41.283 --> 00:49:43.701
really it was more Paul’s message that went forward.

1224
00:49:43.701 --> 00:49:45.360
<v ->It was a misunderstanding of Paul.</v>

1225
00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.380
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1226
00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.820
<v ->I didn’t have much time to go into that yesterday.</v>

1227
00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:52.720
But we misunderstand even the writings of the Apostles Paul.

1228
00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.421
Some things he did not have clear

1229
00:49:54.421 --> 00:49:56.704
because he never sat under Jesus

1230
00:49:56.704 --> 00:49:58.864
and that was a thorn in his side,

1231
00:49:58.864 --> 00:50:01.263
or a thorn in his flesh, as he put it.

1232
00:50:01.263 --> 00:50:04.002
He was not a sickly man, as people teach,

1233
00:50:04.002 --> 00:50:06.689
because he says I have a thorn in the flesh and he was sick,

1234
00:50:06.689 --> 00:50:07.806
no, no, no, no, no.

1235
00:50:07.806 --> 00:50:09.147
Thorn in the flesh means,

1236
00:50:09.147 --> 00:50:10.606
I never sat under Jesus,

1237
00:50:10.606 --> 00:50:14.142
so I got that constant criticism against me all the time.

1238
00:50:14.142 --> 00:50:16.112
<v Regina>Because he didn’t learn with him?</v>

1239
00:50:16.112 --> 00:50:18.357
<v ->Whereas the others were.</v>

1240
00:50:18.357 --> 00:50:21.821
He was going out to the Gentiles,

1241
00:50:21.821 --> 00:50:23.581
to Syrians,

1242
00:50:23.581 --> 00:50:26.041
and some Greeks were coming in,

1243
00:50:26.041 --> 00:50:27.291
and some Roman people,

1244
00:50:27.291 --> 00:50:29.095
but not that many.

1245
00:50:29.095 --> 00:50:33.941
It was more other Semitic people that were in that area.

1246
00:50:33.941 --> 00:50:36.661
<v Regina>In summary,</v>

1247
00:50:36.661 --> 00:50:39.461
what is the core message?

1248
00:50:39.461 --> 00:50:41.399
I think we’ve covered it, but still,

1249
00:50:41.399 --> 00:50:42.549
if you can articulate it

1250
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:43.676
or choose to another way,

1251
00:50:43.676 --> 00:50:45.416
that you really trying to do

1252
00:50:45.416 --> 00:50:47.876
through your work and helping people understand the essence

1253
00:50:47.876 --> 00:50:50.882
of what you understand from the Aramaic writings.

1254
00:50:50.882 --> 00:50:53.782
<v ->Like I said in the beginning</v>

1255
00:50:53.782 --> 00:50:57.650
coming from Aramaic, it helps clarify

1256
00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:00.567
a better picture of God.

1257
00:51:00.567 --> 00:51:02.479
Understanding is what I really mean,

1258
00:51:02.479 --> 00:51:04.679
an understanding of God, what God is,

1259
00:51:04.679 --> 00:51:06.595
not a supernatural being.

1260
00:51:06.595 --> 00:51:08.635
God is not a supernatural being,

1261
00:51:08.635 --> 00:51:10.854
God is part of what all of us are,

1262
00:51:10.854 --> 00:51:13.455
our spirits, our hearts,

1263
00:51:13.455 --> 00:51:15.947
this is what God is.

1264
00:51:18.567 --> 00:51:22.189
Understanding other human beings,

1265
00:51:22.189 --> 00:51:27.034
and following it so I can get along with you peaceably.

1266
00:51:27.034 --> 00:51:28.850
It’s strange, it's in us.

1267
00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:29.909
I use an illustration,

1268
00:51:29.909 --> 00:51:31.165
I don’t know how much time I have,

1269
00:51:31.165 --> 00:51:32.621
but I use an illustration,

1270
00:51:32.621 --> 00:51:35.101
I say it’s the funny thing about us,

1271
00:51:35.101 --> 00:51:38.782
if we’re walking along the beach and someone is drowning,

1272
00:51:38.782 --> 00:51:41.341
and we hear them cry for help,

1273
00:51:41.951 --> 00:51:43.887
you will run in there.

1274
00:51:43.887 --> 00:51:46.383
If you can’t swim to save them,

1275
00:51:46.383 --> 00:51:48.628
you’ll get someone to do it.

1276
00:51:49.598 --> 00:51:51.218
You don’t stop and ask,

1277
00:51:51.218 --> 00:51:53.383
are you saved, brother?

1278
00:51:53.488 --> 00:51:58.488
Or, what’s the color of your skin? Or…

1279
00:52:01.383 --> 00:52:02.503
<v Regina>Which denomination are you?</v>

1280
00:52:02.503 --> 00:52:03.783
<v ->What denomination are you?</v>

1281
00:52:03.783 --> 00:52:07.328
Or anything, what is your political standing?

1282
00:52:08.938 --> 00:52:10.638
That’s all gone.

1283
00:52:10.638 --> 00:52:13.359
Why? Why?

1284
00:52:13.359 --> 00:52:17.628
Because life calls to life.

1285
00:52:17.654 --> 00:52:21.870
And all of a sudden, all boundaries are crossed,

1286
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:23.460
transcended.

1287
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:25.390
Life calls to life,

1288
00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:26.916
so you go in there and rescue them.

1289
00:52:27.626 --> 00:52:29.466
You get them out of the water,

1290
00:52:29.466 --> 00:52:31.122
then you get the water out of them.

1291
00:52:31.122 --> 00:52:32.762
Stand them up, straighten them out,

1292
00:52:32.762 --> 00:52:33.954
then you fight.

1293
00:52:33.954 --> 00:52:35.450
(laughter)

1294
00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:37.506
I use that as an illustration.

1295
00:52:37.506 --> 00:52:39.806
But it’s like what Martin Luther King Jr. said,

1296
00:52:39.806 --> 00:52:43.246
our loyalties must,

1297
00:52:43.246 --> 00:52:47.276
must transcend our faith,

1298
00:52:47.906 --> 00:52:50.136
our race,

1299
00:52:51.206 --> 00:52:52.805
our thinking,

1300
00:52:52.805 --> 00:52:55.366
our loyalties must transcend it

1301
00:52:55.366 --> 00:52:57.766
when it comes to another human being.

1302
00:52:57.766 --> 00:52:59.126
Otherwise, we’ll never have peace.

1303
00:52:59.126 --> 00:53:01.086
We’ll never get a world perspective

1304
00:53:01.086 --> 00:53:03.126
until our loyalties transcend it.

1305
00:53:03.126 --> 00:53:06.336
We can’t literally transcend our race,

1306
00:53:06.646 --> 00:53:08.672
but our loyalties can.

1307
00:53:09.122 --> 00:53:10.702
You see, that’s the difference.

1308
00:53:10.702 --> 00:53:13.122
Religion and everything else,

1309
00:53:13.122 --> 00:53:14.782
now you’ve found God.

1310
00:53:14.782 --> 00:53:16.682
Because God is universal,

1311
00:53:16.682 --> 00:53:19.272
and the human family is universal.

1312
00:53:20.222 --> 00:53:23.342
<v Regina>On that, thank you so much, Rocco.</v>

1313
00:53:23.342 --> 00:53:25.898
I love your passion, I love your heart.

1314
00:53:25.898 --> 00:53:28.958
It’s a beautiful and necessary message.

1315
00:53:28.958 --> 00:53:30.078
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1316
00:53:30.078 --> 00:53:31.538
<v Regina>Thank you.</v>

1317
00:53:33.248 --> 00:53:35.074
For a deeper understanding of Rocco’s work,

1318
00:53:35.074 --> 00:53:36.670
and to check into his many books,

1319
00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:38.806
you can go to his website at noohra,

1320
00:53:38.806 --> 00:53:42.106
N-O-O-H-R-A dot com.

1321
00:53:42.106 --> 00:53:44.066
As an aside, after the interview,

1322
00:53:44.066 --> 00:53:45.866
I told him I was sorry I hadn’t taken the time

1323
00:53:45.866 --> 00:53:47.846
to ask about the word hell.

1324
00:53:47.846 --> 00:53:51.326
He said in fact, that hell actually means regret.

1325
00:53:51.326 --> 00:53:54.386
A life filled with regrets is the translation of hell.

1326
00:53:54.386 --> 00:53:57.692
No devil, pitchfork, no Phoenix plus temperatures,

1327
00:53:57.692 --> 00:53:59.452
just thought you’d like to know.

1328
00:53:59.452 --> 00:54:02.622
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1329
00:54:03.512 --> 00:54:06.761
(calm music)
