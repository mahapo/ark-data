<v ->It has been said that money is the root of all evil.</v>

2
00:00:04.386 --> 00:00:07.330 line:15% 
While this may not be entirely so, the mental and emotional

3
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.782 line:15% 
enslavement that we experience around the subject is

4
00:00:09.782 --> 00:00:12.450 line:15% 
certainly the cause of a great deal of suffering.

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.266 line:15% 
How did we become so engrossed in the system of money,

6
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:18.338 line:15% 
which is a relatively new concept in human history?

7
00:00:18.338 --> 00:00:21.454 line:15% 
Tom Greco and I had a wonderful discussion about money,

8
00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:24.328 line:15% 
it's history, and our future beyond money.

9
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:36.958 line:15% 
Tom, if you could explain how you ended up really

10
00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:39.474 line:15% 
focusing in some of these much needed and

11
00:00:39.474 --> 00:00:42.546 line:15% 
very intriguing areas of the economy, or the new,

12
00:00:42.546 --> 00:00:44.869 line:15% 
hopefully emerging, types of economies.

13
00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:46.743 line:15% 
I would like to hear that.

14
00:00:47.557 --> 00:00:50.034 line:15% 
<v ->Well the whole thing started because of my interest</v>

15
00:00:50.034 --> 00:00:52.140 line:15% 
and concern about social justice.

16
00:00:54.085 --> 00:00:58.693 line:15% 
Several years ago, I started to look into this.

17
00:00:58.693 --> 00:01:02.184 line:15% 
What were the root causes of the world's problems?

18
00:01:02.184 --> 00:01:04.693 line:15% 
Why did we have starvation in the midst of plenty?

19
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.342 line:15% 
Why do we have recurring wars?

20
00:01:07.752 --> 00:01:10.414 line:15% 
What can we do to stop all of that?

21
00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:17.379 line:15% 
I very quickly got channeled into the realm of economics,

22
00:01:18.075 --> 00:01:21.461 line:15% 
because I saw the tremendous inequities that exist.

23
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.562 line:15% 
I started to take a look at why do these inequities exist.

24
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:32.621 line:15% 
And I quickly realized, that we have a money system

25
00:01:33.075 --> 00:01:35.413 line:15% 
that is inherently flawed.

26
00:01:35.847 --> 00:01:38.323 line:15% 
There's several problems with the money system.

27
00:01:38.323 --> 00:01:42.733 line:15% 
Primarily, I discovered that the way money is created,

28
00:01:43.827 --> 00:01:46.317 line:15% 
creates an impossible situation.

29
00:01:47.515 --> 00:01:50.311 line:15% 
Money today is nothing but credit,

30
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:54.023 line:15% 
and it's credit that's allocated by the banking system

31
00:01:54.023 --> 00:01:56.020 line:15% 
in the form of loans.

32
00:01:56.218 --> 00:01:59.373 line:15% 
Of course, the bank charges interest on every loan.

33
00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:03.347 line:15% 
So the thing about interest is that it causes

34
00:02:03.347 --> 00:02:06.452 line:15% 
debt to increase simply with the passage of time.

35
00:02:06.867 --> 00:02:09.441 line:15% 
That's the compound interest function.

36
00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.455 line:15% 
If you borrow 100 dollars today, you will owe

37
00:02:12.455 --> 00:02:15.610 line:15% 
maybe 110 dollars a year from now.

38
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.218 line:15% 
And two years from now, it'll be a 121 dollars

39
00:02:20.218 --> 00:02:24.097 line:15% 
cause you have to pay interest on the accumulated interest.

40
00:02:24.698 --> 00:02:28.282 line:15% 
So, we've seen this continual build up of debt

41
00:02:28.282 --> 00:02:31.905 line:15% 
in the economy, this isn't just theoretical, this is actual.

42
00:02:32.314 --> 00:02:37.114 line:15% 
In recent years, we're seeing it escalate

43
00:02:37.114 --> 00:02:39.206 line:15% 
in huge proportions.

44
00:02:39.206 --> 00:02:43.110 line:15% 
We're seeing how the total debt just over the last 30 years

45
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.074 line:15% 
has climbed to astronomical proportions in

46
00:02:46.074 --> 00:02:50.188 line:15% 
comparison to what it was just three decades ago.

47
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.946 line:15% 
The federal government debt also,

48
00:02:53.946 --> 00:02:56.550 line:15% 
this is one major sector that is showing tremendous

49
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.059 line:15% 
explosion of debt.

50
00:03:00.153 --> 00:03:03.221 line:15% 
The U.S. government debt, now, stands at around

51
00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:06.037 line:15% 
11.7 trillion dollars.

52
00:03:06.555 --> 00:03:10.099 line:15% 
That's just the federal government debt.

53
00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.753 line:15% 
There's no way that this debt is ever going to be repaid.

54
00:03:13.887 --> 00:03:17.255 line:15% 
The government simply, when the bonds come due,

55
00:03:17.255 --> 00:03:20.338 line:15% 
it repays those bonds but it issues replacement bonds

56
00:03:20.338 --> 00:03:24.216 line:15% 
and then some additional to cover it's current deficits.

57
00:03:26.078 --> 00:03:29.702 line:15% 
What I discovered is we have, in this monetary system,

58
00:03:29.702 --> 00:03:34.219 line:15% 
we have a growth imperative because of the debt imperative.

59
00:03:34.334 --> 00:03:37.662 line:15% 
When debt grows exponentially with the passage of time,

60
00:03:37.662 --> 00:03:42.206 line:15% 
it forces everything else to try to grow in order to..

61
00:03:42.206 --> 00:03:43.398 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>To sustain it.</v>

62
00:03:43.398 --> 00:03:45.574 line:15% 
<v ->You're right, in order to sustain the system,</v>

63
00:03:45.574 --> 00:03:48.472 line:15% 
in order for the debts to be managed.

64
00:03:49.502 --> 00:03:53.041 line:15% 
But, it's an impossible situation, sort of like the game

65
00:03:53.041 --> 00:03:57.777 line:15% 
of musical chairs, except instead of taking away chairs,

66
00:03:57.777 --> 00:03:59.819 line:15% 
we're adding more people.

67
00:04:00.081 --> 00:04:02.750 line:15% 
So, more and more people are having to bear

68
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.831 line:15% 
more and more debt.

69
00:04:05.605 --> 00:04:08.145 line:15% 
Eventually, we reach a point where it's impossible

70
00:04:08.145 --> 00:04:09.675 line:15% 
to be born.

71
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.481 line:15% 
The system must create additional debt

72
00:04:14.481 --> 00:04:17.041 line:15% 
year after year after year.

73
00:04:17.041 --> 00:04:20.477 line:15% 
It can either lend into the private sector,

74
00:04:20.477 --> 00:04:23.863 line:15% 
or it can lend into the public sector, the government.

75
00:04:24.869 --> 00:04:29.869 line:15% 
What we saw in this most recent cycle in the bubble and bust

76
00:04:30.181 --> 00:04:35.181 line:15% 
phenomenon, that's an artifact of this monetary system,

77
00:04:35.429 --> 00:04:40.010 line:15% 
we saw banks lending on the basis of real estate.

78
00:04:40.656 --> 00:04:45.053 line:15% 
And they were lending without adequate regard to

79
00:04:45.053 --> 00:04:47.903 line:15% 
the borrowers ability to repay.

80
00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.133 line:15% 
So, by making credit easily available to purchase

81
00:04:51.133 --> 00:04:54.436 line:15% 
real estate, you had more people entering the real estate

82
00:04:54.436 --> 00:04:58.749 line:15% 
market buying residential real estate, buying commercial

83
00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:02.878 line:15% 
real estate, buying second homes as an investment.

84
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.837 line:15% 
People began to see the prices of real estate escalate,

85
00:05:07.837 --> 00:05:10.628 line:15% 
because there were more buyers in the market

86
00:05:10.628 --> 00:05:14.142 line:15% 
with money from the banks ready to be paid.

87
00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:19.716 line:15% 
So, you had this escalation in market prices of real estate

88
00:05:19.716 --> 00:05:23.108 line:15% 
which justified even larger mortgage loans to be made

89
00:05:23.108 --> 00:05:25.834 line:15% 
the next time it was sold.

90
00:05:26.716 --> 00:05:30.940 line:15% 
Of course, eventually, the bubble reaches the point where

91
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.292 line:15% 
you've loaned to everybody who's available to lend to

92
00:05:35.292 --> 00:05:39.876 line:15% 
and those that you loaned to originally having inadequate

93
00:05:39.876 --> 00:05:43.588 line:15% 
incomes to service those loans are beginning to default

94
00:05:43.588 --> 00:05:47.023 line:15% 
so the bubble collapses, more real estate is thrown on

95
00:05:47.023 --> 00:05:51.439 line:15% 
the market, prices begin to decline, and you have a lot of

96
00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:56.342 line:15% 
uncollectible debt that needs to be written off.

97
00:05:58.307 --> 00:06:00.828 line:15% 
Now, what the government has done, this became

98
00:06:00.828 --> 00:06:05.588 line:15% 
such a severe problem in September of 2008,

99
00:06:06.268 --> 00:06:09.259 line:15% 
that the whole global system of money and finance

100
00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:11.153 line:15% 
was on the verge of collapse.

101
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.451 line:15% 
In order to keep it from collapsing, the government

102
00:06:16.451 --> 00:06:19.491 line:15% 
asked congress for the power

103
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:23.931 line:15% 
to borrow and to bail

104
00:06:23.957 --> 00:06:28.131 line:15% 
out the banks, and so we've had this shift.

105
00:06:29.036 --> 00:06:32.211 line:15% 
This private debt that was on the books at the private bank,

106
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:36.109 line:15% 
has been taken over now by the government public sector.

107
00:06:36.588 --> 00:06:40.959 line:15% 
As I said earlier, the debt either has to be expanded into

108
00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:43.411 line:15% 
the private sector or it has to be expanded

109
00:06:43.411 --> 00:06:47.020 line:15% 
into the public sector, but it has to be expanded.

110
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.299 line:15% 
Eventually, it ends up in the public sector because the

111
00:06:49.299 --> 00:06:54.299 line:15% 
public sector is the most able to bear it.

112
00:06:57.235 --> 00:07:01.203 line:15% 
But what you have now is an arrangement, and this gone on

113
00:07:01.203 --> 00:07:03.275 line:15% 
for the last 300 years.

114
00:07:03.275 --> 00:07:07.371 line:15% 
You have an arrangement between politics and finance

115
00:07:07.371 --> 00:07:12.357 line:15% 
whereby governments can spend beyond their tax revenues.

116
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:18.099 line:15% 
In return, the banking cartel gets the privilege of lending

117
00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:21.272 line:15% 
money into circulation at interest.

118
00:07:21.683 --> 00:07:25.779 line:15% 
So we have, as I call it, two parasitic elements within

119
00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:29.171 line:15% 
the economy that are attached to this global system

120
00:07:29.171 --> 00:07:30.892 line:15% 
of money and banking.

121
00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:34.334 line:15% 
You have the interest that everyone has to pay in order

122
00:07:34.334 --> 00:07:38.642 line:15% 
to bring money into circulation, and you have the inflation

123
00:07:38.642 --> 00:07:42.691 line:15% 
that's caused by the monetization of government debt.

124
00:07:43.637 --> 00:07:47.049 line:15% 
And that monetization is gonna increase more and more

125
00:07:47.049 --> 00:07:48.195 line:15% 
as time goes on.

126
00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:52.232 line:15% 
What happens when you monetize the government debt,

127
00:07:52.232 --> 00:07:56.136 line:15% 
is you basically put empty dollars, legalized counterfeit

128
00:07:56.136 --> 00:07:57.589 line:15% 
into the economy.

129
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:59.080 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Which is happening at lightening speed</v>

130
00:07:59.080 --> 00:07:59.741 line:15% 
as we speak.

131
00:07:59.741 --> 00:08:02.024 line:15% 
<v ->Right, without putting additional goods and services</v>

132
00:08:02.024 --> 00:08:05.672 line:15% 
into the economy, so the ultimate effect is going to be

133
00:08:05.672 --> 00:08:09.192 line:15% 
hyper inflation, the reduction of the purchasing power

134
00:08:09.192 --> 00:08:10.493 line:15% 
of the money.

135
00:08:10.493 --> 00:08:13.820 line:15% 
And we've seen this happen over and over again

136
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.704 line:15% 
in cases like the Weimar Republic of Germany after the

137
00:08:17.704 --> 00:08:20.002 line:15% 
first world war.

138
00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:23.464 line:15% 
They expanded the money supply to such enormous

139
00:08:23.464 --> 00:08:26.664 line:15% 
proportions that they were issuing

140
00:08:26.664 --> 00:08:30.012 line:15% 
notes in denominations of 500 million marks

141
00:08:30.012 --> 00:08:32.380 line:15% 
or billion marks, two billion marks...

142
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.496 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>I saw one recently framed in a household</v>

143
00:08:35.496 --> 00:08:38.228 line:15% 
it was of a few million in denomination, yes.

144
00:08:38.228 --> 00:08:41.020 line:15% 
<v ->It's a classic example, and prices were increasing</v>

145
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.160 line:15% 
so rapidly that people were asking to be paid twice a day

146
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.872 line:15% 
so that they could hand off the bundles of notes to

147
00:08:48.872 --> 00:08:52.220 line:15% 
their relatives and friends so they could take them to

148
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.956 line:15% 
the shops and spend them before they lost further value.

149
00:08:55.956 --> 00:08:58.708 line:15% 
So this is the kind of thing that we're looking at when we

150
00:08:58.708 --> 00:09:01.671 line:15% 
have an inflation of the money supply through

151
00:09:01.671 --> 00:09:04.097 line:15% 
monetization of the debt.

152
00:09:04.636 --> 00:09:06.708 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Is that a literal path you see, the</v>

153
00:09:06.708 --> 00:09:09.780 line:15% 
United States for example, going down now?

154
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.780 line:15% 
<v ->I do, right now that has not happened because</v>

155
00:09:14.812 --> 00:09:16.820 line:15% 
we also have a depression.

156
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.891 line:15% 
You see, the private productive sector is being starved

157
00:09:20.891 --> 00:09:24.455 line:15% 
for credit while the public sector is being lavished

158
00:09:24.455 --> 00:09:28.660 line:15% 
with credit to support the empire, to bail out the banks,

159
00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:33.660 line:15% 
and to do all kinds of waste that government typically

160
00:09:33.844 --> 00:09:38.844 line:15% 
does in giving favored clients

161
00:09:39.398 --> 00:09:42.318 line:15% 
contracts to pursue the war

162
00:09:42.318 --> 00:09:45.536 line:15% 
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

163
00:09:46.542 --> 00:09:49.382 line:15% 
The military industrial complex is doing very well,

164
00:09:49.382 --> 00:09:50.739 line:15% 
thank you.

165
00:09:50.745 --> 00:09:52.857 line:15% 
You know, there getting all kinds of funding.

166
00:09:52.857 --> 00:09:54.094 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>About the only ones that seem to be</v>

167
00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:56.825 line:15% 
getting funding still, the war effort.

168
00:09:56.825 --> 00:09:59.878 line:15% 
<v ->And yet, the private productive sector, especially the</v>

169
00:09:59.878 --> 00:10:02.438 line:15% 
small and medium sized businesses, are being starved

170
00:10:02.438 --> 00:10:03.880 line:15% 
for capitol.

171
00:10:04.505 --> 00:10:07.494 line:15% 
So, you have bankruptcies happening, and you have

172
00:10:07.494 --> 00:10:09.709 line:15% 
people being thrown out of work.

173
00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:12.781 line:15% 
So in this sector, people are still scrambling to get

174
00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:16.601 line:15% 
enough dollars to service their debts, to put food

175
00:10:16.601 --> 00:10:18.855 line:15% 
on the table, and to pay the rent.

176
00:10:20.678 --> 00:10:25.678 line:15% 
While in this other sector, you have credit being lavished,

177
00:10:26.541 --> 00:10:28.839 line:15% 
and that sector is spending.

178
00:10:29.172 --> 00:10:32.460 line:15% 
They're sucking value out of the economy, bidding the prices

179
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:37.171 line:15% 
of real goods and services up, and eventually that's going

180
00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:40.326 line:15% 
to reach hyperinflationary levels.

181
00:10:40.799 --> 00:10:44.063 line:15% 
So we're going to see a devasement of the dollar continue,

182
00:10:44.063 --> 00:10:46.623 line:15% 
and we're going to see prices increase, especially

183
00:10:46.623 --> 00:10:49.261 line:15% 
prices of imports.

184
00:10:49.996 --> 00:10:54.431 line:15% 
The United States has been, for quite a long time, running

185
00:10:54.431 --> 00:10:57.035 line:15% 
these twin deficits: the budget deficit and

186
00:10:57.035 --> 00:10:59.275 line:15% 
the trade deficit.

187
00:10:59.275 --> 00:11:02.707 line:15% 
The United States has been buying more from foreigners

188
00:11:02.707 --> 00:11:05.291 line:15% 
than we've been selling to foreigners.

189
00:11:05.291 --> 00:11:08.452 line:15% 
The foreigners have been using their dollar earnings

190
00:11:08.452 --> 00:11:11.801 line:15% 
to buy U.S. government bonds and other securities

191
00:11:11.801 --> 00:11:13.430 line:15% 
of U.S. corporations.

192
00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.387 line:15% 
So the Chinese, for example, they have about one and a half

193
00:11:17.387 --> 00:11:21.635 line:15% 
trillion dollars worth of dollar denominated investments,

194
00:11:21.635 --> 00:11:24.855 line:15% 
including, I think, about 600 billion dollars worth of

195
00:11:24.855 --> 00:11:26.193 line:15% 
U.S. government bonds.

196
00:11:26.925 --> 00:11:30.061 line:15% 
They're getting kind of nervous, now, when they see that

197
00:11:30.061 --> 00:11:34.834 line:15% 
the enormous monetization of government debt.

198
00:11:36.056 --> 00:11:39.552 line:15% 
And they're looking at their enormous dollar holdings,

199
00:11:39.552 --> 00:11:42.221 line:15% 
and worrying that they're not going to get value for those

200
00:11:42.221 --> 00:11:43.834 line:15% 
dollar holdings.

201
00:11:44.696 --> 00:11:48.768 line:15% 
What they're trying to do now is to limit their accumulation

202
00:11:48.768 --> 00:11:52.120 line:15% 
of dollar denominated assets and diversify their

203
00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.310 line:15% 
foreign exchange holdings.

204
00:11:54.976 --> 00:11:57.920 line:15% 
So they've put us on notice, that they're not going to

205
00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.798 line:15% 
accumulate dollars the way they have in the past.

206
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.048 line:15% 
But, you know, their economy has been largely dependent

207
00:12:05.048 --> 00:12:07.676 line:15% 
on sales into the U.S. market,

208
00:12:08.576 --> 00:12:12.127 line:15% 
and so they're sort of between a rock and a hard place.

209
00:12:12.127 --> 00:12:13.828 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

210
00:12:14.922 --> 00:12:17.694 line:15% 
<v ->The U.S. government officials have been complaining</v>

211
00:12:17.694 --> 00:12:22.254 line:15% 
about the Chinese currency being overvalued,

212
00:12:22.704 --> 00:12:26.436 line:15% 
but I think this is a rather disingenuous complaint,

213
00:12:26.577 --> 00:12:29.776 line:15% 
because you can't have it both ways.

214
00:12:29.776 --> 00:12:32.568 line:15% 
Do we want them to buy up our debt or do we want

215
00:12:32.568 --> 00:12:37.568 line:15% 
them to stop sending all their goods and services into

216
00:12:37.668 --> 00:12:41.936 line:15% 
our market and providing us with cheap Chinese made goods

217
00:12:41.936 --> 00:12:45.086 line:15% 
that are relatively high quality, by the way.

218
00:12:47.988 --> 00:12:52.988 line:15% 
This whole system of global exchange and money in banking

219
00:12:54.094 --> 00:12:56.392 line:15% 
I think has reached it's limits.

220
00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.878 line:15% 
It cannot be sustained much longer.

221
00:12:58.878 --> 00:13:01.541 line:15% 
We're going to have to reinvent money and banking from

222
00:13:01.541 --> 00:13:03.199 line:15% 
the bottom up.

223
00:13:04.765 --> 00:13:09.765 line:15% 
The way I see that being done is by going to

224
00:13:10.077 --> 00:13:14.700 line:15% 
cashless exchange on a local community by community basis.

225
00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:19.909 line:15% 
We can set up mutual credit clearing systems that provide

226
00:13:19.909 --> 00:13:24.136 line:15% 
the direct clearing of purchases

227
00:13:24.136 --> 00:13:28.183 line:15% 
and sales by the principles in the economy.

228
00:13:28.317 --> 00:13:31.574 line:15% 
You've got buyers and sellers, first party, second party.

229
00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.380 line:15% 
Typically, a seller will provide goods and services to a

230
00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:40.328 line:15% 
buyer and a buyer will pay for those goods and services

231
00:13:40.328 --> 00:13:43.696 line:15% 
using conventional money: dollars in the United States,

232
00:13:43.696 --> 00:13:46.236 line:15% 
euros in the Euro zone.

233
00:13:46.236 --> 00:13:48.200 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Won, Yen.</v>

234
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.436 line:15% 
<v ->Whatever.</v>

235
00:13:49.436 --> 00:13:52.488 line:15% 
So these are all political currencies, they're managed by

236
00:13:52.488 --> 00:13:56.072 line:15% 
some central bank, and the central bank may or may not

237
00:13:56.072 --> 00:13:57.928 line:15% 
be owned by the government.

238
00:13:57.928 --> 00:13:59.695 line:15% 
In the United States, the central bank is the

239
00:13:59.695 --> 00:14:02.447 line:15% 
Federal Reserve, it's a private company, and it's

240
00:14:02.447 --> 00:14:05.372 line:15% 
independent to the government, and both

241
00:14:05.372 --> 00:14:08.418 line:15% 
unresponsive and unaccountable.

242
00:14:09.999 --> 00:14:12.903 line:15% 
Representative Grayson from Florida has been

243
00:14:12.903 --> 00:14:14.991 line:15% 
holding their feet to the fire, trying to get them to

244
00:14:14.991 --> 00:14:18.697 line:15% 
reveal their operations, so far without success.

245
00:14:19.367 --> 00:14:20.815 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Twice or three times I've heard that there</v>

246
00:14:20.815 --> 00:14:25.473 line:15% 
were deadlines for the audit to occur, yet it never occurs.

247
00:14:25.473 --> 00:14:27.538 line:15% 
<v ->The fed has never been audited.</v>

248
00:14:28.352 --> 00:14:31.552 line:15% 
Representative Ron Paul from Texas has been calling for the

249
00:14:31.552 --> 00:14:35.622 line:15% 
fed to be audited, and in fact, for the fed to be abolished,

250
00:14:36.632 --> 00:14:39.462 line:15% 
I think a move which is long overdue.

251
00:14:39.768 --> 00:14:44.140 line:15% 
But getting back to the local exchange systems,

252
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:48.300 line:15% 
instead of paying with conventional political money,

253
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.735 line:15% 
basically, businesses can pay with their own goods

254
00:14:51.735 --> 00:14:53.137 line:15% 
and services.

255
00:14:53.271 --> 00:14:55.020 line:15% 
It's goods and services that pay for other

256
00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.960 line:15% 
goods and services, ultimately, any way.

257
00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.031 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Are we talking a barter system then or...</v>

258
00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:02.167 line:15% 
<v ->Well, it's typically regarded as barter, but barter</v>

259
00:15:02.167 --> 00:15:03.718 line:15% 
is one on one.

260
00:15:03.792 --> 00:15:06.608 line:15% 
You have something I want, I have something you want,

261
00:15:06.608 --> 00:15:08.074 line:15% 
we make a trade.

262
00:15:08.252 --> 00:15:13.252 line:15% 
But when we have an association of multiple players,

263
00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:17.354 line:15% 
it doesn't have to be direct, one to one barter.

264
00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.132 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>So give us an idea of how that would play out</v>

265
00:15:19.132 --> 00:15:21.564 line:15% 
in a small community for example.

266
00:15:21.564 --> 00:15:23.908 line:15% 
<v ->Well, I'll give you an example from the commercial</v>

267
00:15:23.908 --> 00:15:25.546 line:15% 
barter realm.

268
00:15:25.596 --> 00:15:27.516 line:15% 
There are commercial companies that provide credit

269
00:15:27.516 --> 00:15:32.080 line:15% 
clearing services to businesses, business to business

270
00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.038 line:15% 
exchange, without the use of cash.

271
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.244 line:15% 
There are hundred of them around the world.

272
00:15:39.554 --> 00:15:42.140 line:15% 
There's an association called the International Reciprocal

273
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:46.108 line:15% 
Trade Association, which is the trade association for this

274
00:15:46.108 --> 00:15:50.204 line:15% 
industry, commercial barter business, properly called

275
00:15:50.204 --> 00:15:52.508 line:15% 
commercial trade exchanges.

276
00:15:52.508 --> 00:15:55.900 line:15% 
What they do is they recruit members to participate in the

277
00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.558 line:15% 
circle of exchange.

278
00:15:58.159 --> 00:16:00.655 line:15% 
They may have restaurants, they may have office

279
00:16:00.655 --> 00:16:04.367 line:15% 
supply stores, they may have plumbers, electricians,

280
00:16:04.367 --> 00:16:07.951 line:15% 
all kinds of professional services, and retail wholesale

281
00:16:07.951 --> 00:16:11.047 line:15% 
establishments, and they do business with one another

282
00:16:11.047 --> 00:16:13.193 line:15% 
on a non cash basis.

283
00:16:14.119 --> 00:16:18.255 line:15% 
If I have a restaurant, when I sell a meal to a member,

284
00:16:18.255 --> 00:16:20.617 line:15% 
I get a credit in my account.

285
00:16:21.223 --> 00:16:24.571 line:15% 
I can then use that credit to buy office supplies, or

286
00:16:24.571 --> 00:16:28.347 line:15% 
get plumbing services, or electrician services,

287
00:16:28.347 --> 00:16:31.557 line:15% 
or anything else that's available within the association.

288
00:16:31.928 --> 00:16:33.906 line:15% 
So, it's as simple as that.

289
00:16:34.488 --> 00:16:37.155 line:15% 
Money is really just an accounting system.

290
00:16:37.155 --> 00:16:39.479 line:15% 
The banks still pretend that it's something physical

291
00:16:39.479 --> 00:16:43.269 line:15% 
and real, so that they can lend it to us at interest.

292
00:16:43.979 --> 00:16:46.499 line:15% 
And the way that I describe the banking system currently,

293
00:16:46.499 --> 00:16:50.123 line:15% 
I say that we give our credit to the banks, and then we ask

294
00:16:50.123 --> 00:16:52.899 line:15% 
them to lend some of it back to us and we pay them

295
00:16:52.899 --> 00:16:54.833 line:15% 
interest for the privilege.

296
00:16:56.075 --> 00:16:58.251 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Sometimes we beg them to loan it</v>

297
00:16:58.251 --> 00:16:59.191 line:15% 
back to us.

298
00:16:59.191 --> 00:17:01.219 line:15% 
<v ->Absolutely, absolutely.</v>

299
00:17:01.219 --> 00:17:06.219 line:15% 
And they make credit scarce for the productive sector,

300
00:17:06.314 --> 00:17:09.987 line:15% 
and they make it readily available to favored clients

301
00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:13.445 line:15% 
and to the political

302
00:17:15.671 --> 00:17:18.929
cohorts and the government sector.

303
00:17:19.019 --> 00:17:22.583 line:15% 
We can reinvent money in banking from the bottom up

304
00:17:22.583 --> 00:17:26.181 line:15% 
by creating these mutual credit clearing circles

305
00:17:26.251 --> 00:17:29.957 line:15% 
in every community and then networking them together.

306
00:17:30.731 --> 00:17:34.807 line:15% 
It's sort of similar to what has happened in the development

307
00:17:34.807 --> 00:17:36.017 line:15% 
of computers.

308
00:17:37.214 --> 00:17:40.779 line:15% 
You know, you have your laptop, I have my laptop,

309
00:17:40.779 --> 00:17:43.830 line:15% 
so we have our own local computing system and our

310
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:48.779 line:15% 
own local databases on our hard drives, but we also

311
00:17:48.779 --> 00:17:52.982 line:15% 
have been able in recent years to network our computers

312
00:17:52.982 --> 00:17:56.926 line:15% 
together so that we can share files, and we can share

313
00:17:56.926 --> 00:17:59.358 line:15% 
information over the internet, we can communicate

314
00:17:59.358 --> 00:18:03.435 line:15% 
through the internet, and so we can transact business

315
00:18:03.435 --> 00:18:06.116 line:15% 
from your computer to my computer so to speak.

316
00:18:06.806 --> 00:18:10.454 line:15% 
Likewise, in these local credit clearing exchanges

317
00:18:10.454 --> 00:18:12.906 line:15% 
we will be able, when we network them together, to

318
00:18:12.906 --> 00:18:17.336 line:15% 
transact business across the exchange boundaries.

319
00:18:17.598 --> 00:18:19.448 line:15% 
One person to another.

320
00:18:19.966 --> 00:18:23.038 line:15% 
The settlement process will be taken care of by the

321
00:18:23.038 --> 00:18:25.360 line:15% 
local exchanges behind the scenes.

322
00:18:26.006 --> 00:18:28.836 line:15% 
Just as we have clearing process in banks.

323
00:18:29.078 --> 00:18:31.914 line:15% 
If I have an account at bank A, and you have an account

324
00:18:31.914 --> 00:18:36.914 line:15% 
at bank B, I can write you a check drawn on my account

325
00:18:36.925 --> 00:18:41.130 line:15% 
at bank A, and you can take it to your bank, bank B, and

326
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:42.877 line:15% 
they will cash it.

327
00:18:42.877 --> 00:18:44.477 line:15% 
Even though it's not their obligation.

328
00:18:44.477 --> 00:18:45.098 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

329
00:18:45.098 --> 00:18:46.634 line:15% 
<v ->But then they take care of that in the</v>

330
00:18:46.634 --> 00:18:48.298 line:15% 
bank clearing house.

331
00:18:48.298 --> 00:18:50.941 line:15% 
You know, all the banks used to send runners to the

332
00:18:50.941 --> 00:18:54.671 line:15% 
clearing house, every community had a clearing house.

333
00:18:54.954 --> 00:18:57.066 line:15% 
And the banks at the end of each day, would send all

334
00:18:57.066 --> 00:19:00.117 line:15% 
the checks to the clearing house, and they would tally

335
00:19:00.117 --> 00:19:01.354 line:15% 
them all up.

336
00:19:01.354 --> 00:19:06.060 line:15% 
They might have millions of dollars in checks that were

337
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.682 line:15% 
cashed and deposited into various individual accounts

338
00:19:09.682 --> 00:19:11.709 line:15% 
and business accounts.

339
00:19:11.709 --> 00:19:16.421 line:15% 
And then they would see that, okay, you got bank A owes

340
00:19:16.421 --> 00:19:20.343 line:15% 
bank B five million dollars.

341
00:19:20.369 --> 00:19:25.369 line:15% 
But bank B owes bank A 4.9 million dollars, so they settle

342
00:19:25.937 --> 00:19:29.885 line:15% 
up with a transfer of 100 thousand, a small portion in

343
00:19:29.885 --> 00:19:33.847 line:15% 
relation to the total amount of transactions that were done.

344
00:19:34.085 --> 00:19:36.497 line:15% 
The same thing can be done in these mutual credit clearing

345
00:19:36.497 --> 00:19:38.525 line:15% 
systems that are networked together.

346
00:19:38.525 --> 00:19:40.145 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>One of the questions I have here is,</v>

347
00:19:40.145 --> 00:19:45.145 line:15% 
because the nature of our, the jobs that exist today versus

348
00:19:45.821 --> 00:19:48.740 line:15% 
what existed 50 years ago, for example, has become so much

349
00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.001 line:15% 
more virtual.

350
00:19:50.001 --> 00:19:52.605 line:15% 
It almost seems like half the world are consultants of

351
00:19:52.605 --> 00:19:56.081 line:15% 
some kind, much of it within the financial industry,

352
00:19:56.081 --> 00:19:59.089 line:15% 
Right, personal service and such.

353
00:19:59.089 --> 00:20:02.844 line:15% 
So what happens when you take people, for example,

354
00:20:02.844 --> 00:20:05.532 line:15% 
that don't have a restaurant, and aren't electricians,

355
00:20:05.532 --> 00:20:08.860 line:15% 
don't have these kinds of very necessary skill sets,

356
00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.465 line:15% 
and they make up a large portion of this community,

357
00:20:12.465 --> 00:20:13.572 line:15% 
how does this work?

358
00:20:13.572 --> 00:20:16.604 line:15% 
Do we have to start reevaluating or recreating our

359
00:20:16.604 --> 00:20:20.246 line:15% 
skill sets to be able to plug ourselves into this system?

360
00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.966 line:15% 
<v ->Well that's an interesting point.</v>

361
00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:26.492 line:15% 
Look at what the United States exports today, you know,

362
00:20:26.492 --> 00:20:29.736 line:15% 
our manufacturing has been basically dismantled, and we

363
00:20:29.736 --> 00:20:33.768 line:15% 
are dependent on foreigners for all our manufacturing goods.

364
00:20:33.768 --> 00:20:38.436 line:15% 
What we export now is weapons, financial services,

365
00:20:38.436 --> 00:20:39.721 line:15% 
meaning debt...

366
00:20:39.721 --> 00:20:41.280 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Right, right, debt.</v>

367
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.224 line:15% 
<v ->We teach people how to create debt, our banks are all over</v>

368
00:20:44.224 --> 00:20:47.192 line:15% 
the world, indebting the rest of the world, just the way

369
00:20:47.192 --> 00:20:50.130 line:15% 
they've indebted us in the United States.

370
00:20:51.328 --> 00:20:54.188 line:15% 
Let me add one thing about the local credit clearing

371
00:20:54.188 --> 00:20:59.188 line:15% 
exchanges, these will be non interest credit exchanges.

372
00:20:59.544 --> 00:21:03.212 line:15% 
It's very important to get beyond this growth imperative

373
00:21:03.212 --> 00:21:06.967 line:15% 
that's caused by the compound interest formula.

374
00:21:06.967 --> 00:21:07.882 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

375
00:21:07.882 --> 00:21:12.426 line:15% 
<v ->On working capitol and short term credit.</v>

376
00:21:12.426 --> 00:21:14.882 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>So going back to the skill set issue, and</v>

377
00:21:14.882 --> 00:21:18.487 line:15% 
the U.S. for example, and must of the western world even.

378
00:21:18.487 --> 00:21:22.711 line:15% 
<v ->Well, when you get down to an economy where people</v>

379
00:21:22.711 --> 00:21:27.338 line:15% 
are producing what we actually need, and we stop producing

380
00:21:27.338 --> 00:21:32.338 line:15% 
a lot of junk and unnecessary stuff, weapons for example.

381
00:21:34.722 --> 00:21:38.582 line:15% 
When the military expenditures are no longer needed,

382
00:21:38.582 --> 00:21:42.422 line:15% 
then people will find ways to employ themselves more

383
00:21:42.422 --> 00:21:44.150 line:15% 
productively.

384
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.972 line:15% 
We've solved the production problem.

385
00:21:47.972 --> 00:21:52.068 line:15% 
The production problem used to be the primary problem

386
00:21:52.068 --> 00:21:55.436 line:15% 
in centuries past, when people were starving it was because

387
00:21:55.436 --> 00:21:57.605 line:15% 
they weren't growing enough food.

388
00:21:57.803 --> 00:21:59.832 line:15% 
We don't have that problem anymore.

389
00:21:59.832 --> 00:22:02.456 line:15% 
We grown more than enough food, even if we were to go

390
00:22:02.456 --> 00:22:05.163 line:15% 
totally organic, we would be able to grow more than

391
00:22:05.163 --> 00:22:08.792 line:15% 
enough food than is needed to support all of the

392
00:22:08.792 --> 00:22:13.330 line:15% 
six and a half billion people in the world today.

393
00:22:15.915 --> 00:22:20.888 line:15% 
The benefits of this productivity have not been adequately

394
00:22:20.888 --> 00:22:22.147 line:15% 
distributed.

395
00:22:22.147 --> 00:22:22.955 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

396
00:22:22.955 --> 00:22:25.707 line:15% 
<v ->So we have extreme poverty in some sectors and</v>

397
00:22:25.707 --> 00:22:29.797 line:15% 
extreme affluence in other sectors.

398
00:22:30.699 --> 00:22:33.515 line:15% 
A lot of people have to make their living by catering to

399
00:22:33.515 --> 00:22:38.515 line:15% 
the super rich and providing luxury goods instead of

400
00:22:38.851 --> 00:22:41.361 line:15% 
basic necessities of life.

401
00:22:41.731 --> 00:22:44.395 line:15% 
All of this has been made possible because of the

402
00:22:44.395 --> 00:22:49.239 line:15% 
exploitative nature of this imperial money and

403
00:22:49.239 --> 00:22:51.389 line:15% 
finance system.

404
00:22:53.271 --> 00:22:58.271 line:15% 
When we move more toward sustainable economy

405
00:22:59.435 --> 00:23:03.274 line:15% 
we will be producing more of what people actually need

406
00:23:03.274 --> 00:23:05.681 line:15% 
and less of what we don't need.

407
00:23:07.178 --> 00:23:10.250 line:15% 
We produce a lot of disposable junk now.

408
00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:13.381 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>We do, I mean this, I have another</v>

409
00:23:13.381 --> 00:23:15.792 line:15% 
question forming as a result of what you're saying,

410
00:23:15.792 --> 00:23:19.928 line:15% 
and that is we have a rather limited spectrum of what we

411
00:23:19.928 --> 00:23:24.280 line:15% 
consider necessities which is food, electricity, and a roof

412
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.840 line:15% 
over our heads.

413
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:30.634 line:15% 
But the human skill sets available on this planet are vast.

414
00:23:31.492 --> 00:23:34.928 line:15% 
It seems to me that if you're really embracing the system

415
00:23:34.928 --> 00:23:38.064 line:15% 
you're talking about, we would start placing value on things

416
00:23:38.064 --> 00:23:42.410 line:15% 
that, at least in the west, have been devalued such as art.

417
00:23:43.032 --> 00:23:47.127 line:15% 
A poet would have their offerings to the system, but these

418
00:23:47.127 --> 00:23:50.544 line:15% 
things would actually start having value again within

419
00:23:50.544 --> 00:23:52.080 line:15% 
societies, would they not?

420
00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.488 line:15% 
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

421
00:23:53.488 --> 00:23:58.488 line:15% 
If the production of the world were adequately distributed,

422
00:23:59.287 --> 00:24:03.856 line:15% 
people wouldn't have to spend so much of their time

423
00:24:03.856 --> 00:24:07.070 line:15% 
dealing with the lower level needs.

424
00:24:07.588 --> 00:24:09.508 line:15% 
You know, Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

425
00:24:09.508 --> 00:24:12.623 line:15% 
You have the survival needs at the very base,

426
00:24:12.623 --> 00:24:16.305 line:15% 
and then you go up from their with the self actualization.

427
00:24:18.063 --> 00:24:23.063 line:15% 
If we were distributing our total global products properly,

428
00:24:25.167 --> 00:24:29.042 line:15% 
we would only have to spend a very few hours each week

429
00:24:29.042 --> 00:24:30.489 line:15% 
in work.

430
00:24:30.706 --> 00:24:31.583 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

431
00:24:31.583 --> 00:24:33.631 line:15% 
<v ->We would be able to spend our time doing things that</v>

432
00:24:33.631 --> 00:24:36.959 line:15% 
are much more enjoyable, much more creative, and

433
00:24:36.959 --> 00:24:41.177 line:15% 
much more beneficial to ourselves and our communities.

434
00:24:42.482 --> 00:24:44.422 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>And this is critical because people now</v>

435
00:24:44.422 --> 00:24:49.422 line:15% 
feel, college graduates, you're lucky to get a job in a

436
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.250 line:15% 
restaurant, right now.

437
00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.062 line:15% 
It almost doesn't matter what your degree is in,

438
00:24:53.062 --> 00:24:55.134 line:15% 
there are few areas that are still kind of hot.

439
00:24:55.134 --> 00:24:57.734 line:15% 
Veterinary industry, I hear still needs some people,

440
00:24:57.734 --> 00:25:00.894 line:15% 
but other than this, mostly, you're lucky to get a job in a

441
00:25:00.894 --> 00:25:04.684 line:15% 
restaurant, just to be able to put food on your table.

442
00:25:04.838 --> 00:25:09.150 line:15% 
And so, this is really critical because everybody in every

443
00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:11.750 line:15% 
age group, especially the young ones coming out of college,

444
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:15.377 line:15% 
now, are starting to feel this lessening of possibilities

445
00:25:15.377 --> 00:25:17.958 line:15% 
in this squeeze because they're working two jobs to pay

446
00:25:17.958 --> 00:25:19.814 line:15% 
for their apartment and their food.

447
00:25:19.814 --> 00:25:22.865 line:15% 
Two jobs, they're not necessarily even skilled at, but

448
00:25:22.865 --> 00:25:25.342 line:15% 
have to do because it's all that's available.

449
00:25:25.342 --> 00:25:30.206 line:15% 
This is becoming rather dire on a real human spirit level.

450
00:25:30.206 --> 00:25:34.059 line:15% 
<v ->Yes, and it's sort of a self reinforcing cycle.</v>

451
00:25:34.278 --> 00:25:36.945 line:15% 
When you're driven to the lowest level of needs because

452
00:25:36.945 --> 00:25:40.663 line:15% 
money is scarce, as it is for most of us,

453
00:25:41.113 --> 00:25:46.113 line:15% 
then you're looking for the cheapest thing in the market.

454
00:25:47.302 --> 00:25:52.302 line:15% 
So, companies provide that demand, you know,

455
00:25:52.978 --> 00:25:55.666 line:15% 
instead of making things that are durable and going to last

456
00:25:55.666 --> 00:25:59.762 line:15% 
50 or 100 years, they produce things that they can make

457
00:25:59.762 --> 00:26:03.197 line:15% 
quickly, things that can be made cheaply, but they're

458
00:26:03.197 --> 00:26:04.960 line:15% 
not going to last.

459
00:26:05.094 --> 00:26:07.782 line:15% 
And you're going to have to replace them in a year or two.

460
00:26:07.782 --> 00:26:12.049 line:15% 
So, we're driven more toward cheaper, more disposable

461
00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:16.678 line:15% 
stuff, and what we need to do, it's because labor is

462
00:26:16.678 --> 00:26:21.393 line:15% 
an expense to a corporation, and the higher the labor costs,

463
00:26:21.393 --> 00:26:23.313 line:15% 
the lower the profits.

464
00:26:23.313 --> 00:26:26.941 line:15% 
So, at the same time that they're trying to sell their

465
00:26:26.941 --> 00:26:31.135 line:15% 
products, they're trying to reduce the costs of labor.

466
00:26:31.357 --> 00:26:35.019 line:15% 
But, who the buyers for the products, it's the workers.

467
00:26:35.025 --> 00:26:38.269 line:15% 
Henry Ford had that insight a long time ago,

468
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:40.785 line:15% 
and he had the best paid workers in the industry

469
00:26:40.785 --> 00:26:44.241 line:15% 
because he knew that those were his customers,

470
00:26:44.241 --> 00:26:47.569 line:15% 
they were the ones that we're going to buy his cars.

471
00:26:47.569 --> 00:26:50.469 line:15% 
So, you know, as long as you can exploit labor here, and

472
00:26:50.469 --> 00:26:54.879 line:15% 
sell to affluent people over there, you can sustain this.

473
00:26:55.313 --> 00:26:57.189 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yeah, well you can sustain it for that culture</v>

474
00:26:57.189 --> 00:26:59.685 line:15% 
but not for the one that's being exploited and this is a

475
00:26:59.685 --> 00:27:01.137 line:15% 
global problem there.

476
00:27:01.137 --> 00:27:03.932 line:15% 
I'm just saying, here we're whining because our children,

477
00:27:03.932 --> 00:27:06.492 line:15% 
college graduates can only get a job in a restaurant,

478
00:27:06.492 --> 00:27:10.629 line:15% 
you're talking about huge masses of the population who

479
00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:14.064 line:15% 
farm for industry and can't even feed their own children.

480
00:27:14.064 --> 00:27:17.371 line:15% 
Now, that's at the most desperate end of this heirarchy

481
00:27:17.371 --> 00:27:18.183 line:15% 
of values.

482
00:27:18.183 --> 00:27:18.971 line:15% 
<v ->Exactly.</v>

483
00:27:18.971 --> 00:27:20.743 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>This has to be rebalanced too, and India's</v>

484
00:27:20.743 --> 00:27:22.023 line:15% 
making some headway.

485
00:27:22.023 --> 00:27:24.455 line:15% 
<v ->But what I'm saying, is that we've been able to sustain</v>

486
00:27:24.455 --> 00:27:28.295 line:15% 
this dysfunctional system for so long because we've

487
00:27:28.295 --> 00:27:29.531 line:15% 
been able to do that.

488
00:27:29.531 --> 00:27:32.751 line:15% 
We exploit a market over here, and we sell into a

489
00:27:32.751 --> 00:27:34.075 line:15% 
market over there.

490
00:27:34.075 --> 00:27:34.991 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

491
00:27:34.991 --> 00:27:39.003 line:15% 
<v ->Now that we have a global economy, and</v>

492
00:27:43.183 --> 00:27:47.622 line:15% 
the economies are being all tied into one, we can

493
00:27:47.622 --> 00:27:49.557 line:15% 
no longer do that.

494
00:27:49.563 --> 00:27:52.998 line:15% 
You know, we're seeing, we've reached the limits,

495
00:27:52.998 --> 00:27:54.511 line:15% 
the game is up.

496
00:27:54.511 --> 00:27:58.714 line:15% 
Even George Soros, he's saying that this is the end of

497
00:27:58.714 --> 00:28:01.844 line:15% 
an era, this is not business as usual.

498
00:28:01.894 --> 00:28:03.494 line:15% 
It's the end of an era.

499
00:28:03.494 --> 00:28:06.310 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>The title of your book, "End of Money,</v>

500
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:09.446 line:15% 
Beginning of Civilization", can you just talk about...

501
00:28:09.446 --> 00:28:10.127 line:15% 
I love the title.

502
00:28:10.127 --> 00:28:12.047 line:15% 
<v ->That might have been a better title, actually it's</v>

503
00:28:12.047 --> 00:28:16.820 line:15% 
"End of Money and The Future of CIvilization".

504
00:28:17.146 --> 00:28:19.686 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Although I like that beginning of civilization.</v>

505
00:28:19.686 --> 00:28:21.434 line:15% 
<v ->I like that too, I think that might be</v>

506
00:28:21.434 --> 00:28:22.266 line:15% 
even more appropriate.

507
00:28:22.266 --> 00:28:24.698 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Okay, so let's talk about that.</v>

508
00:28:24.698 --> 00:28:27.214 line:15% 
<v ->To call what we've had up to now, civilization, is</v>

509
00:28:27.214 --> 00:28:28.838 line:15% 
probably a stretch of it.

510
00:28:28.838 --> 00:28:31.782 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yeah, misnomer, so let's talk about why</v>

511
00:28:31.782 --> 00:28:34.676 line:15% 
the title of your book, as it is?

512
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:37.157 line:15% 
This is really an important concept we're all going to have

513
00:28:37.157 --> 00:28:38.010 line:15% 
to deal with.

514
00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:41.678 line:15% 
<v ->Right, it's a question I often have asked, what do you</v>

515
00:28:41.678 --> 00:28:43.359 line:15% 
mean by the end of money?

516
00:28:43.749 --> 00:28:47.077 line:15% 
Well two things, first of all, money has made a progression

517
00:28:47.077 --> 00:28:50.036 line:15% 
in it's evolutionary process.

518
00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:54.394 line:15% 
Money today isn't what it used to be yesterday.

519
00:28:54.394 --> 00:28:56.377 line:15% 
And I'm not just talking about purchasing power,

520
00:28:56.377 --> 00:28:59.423 line:15% 
I'm talking about the actual substance of money.

521
00:28:59.833 --> 00:29:04.709 line:15% 
Going back, let's say 100 years or 200 years, money

522
00:29:04.709 --> 00:29:06.359 line:15% 
was commodities.

523
00:29:07.699 --> 00:29:11.645 line:15% 
It was some commonly useful or

524
00:29:11.645 --> 00:29:14.629 line:15% 
commonly demanded commodity that could be passed

525
00:29:14.629 --> 00:29:17.399 line:15% 
along in return for what you want.

526
00:29:18.497 --> 00:29:21.495 line:15% 
Typically, gold and silver became the commodities of

527
00:29:21.495 --> 00:29:23.903 line:15% 
choice for various reasons.

528
00:29:23.903 --> 00:29:24.695 line:15% 
They were highly...

529
00:29:24.695 --> 00:29:26.305 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Easier to carry a little gold than a pig.</v>

530
00:29:26.305 --> 00:29:28.539 line:15% 
<v ->Right, right.</v>

531
00:29:28.948 --> 00:29:32.596 line:15% 
But we've had tobacco, and salt, and nails, and bullets,

532
00:29:32.596 --> 00:29:37.039 line:15% 
and hides, these have all served as money in the past.

533
00:29:37.834 --> 00:29:40.898 line:15% 
But gold and silver became the preferred commodities

534
00:29:40.898 --> 00:29:42.518 line:15% 
that were used as money.

535
00:29:42.518 --> 00:29:47.426 line:15% 
And at that time, the gold or the silver were actually

536
00:29:47.426 --> 00:29:50.403 line:15% 
commodities that had value in themselves.

537
00:29:50.946 --> 00:29:55.946 line:15% 
And then, banking began to develop and they created

538
00:29:57.154 --> 00:29:58.665 line:15% 
symbolic money.

539
00:29:58.665 --> 00:30:00.905 line:15% 
You would deposit your gold, they would give you basically

540
00:30:00.905 --> 00:30:04.809 line:15% 
a warehouse receipt that said this represents gold

541
00:30:04.809 --> 00:30:09.051 line:15% 
on deposit, and pay to the bearer on demand.

542
00:30:09.078 --> 00:30:12.513 line:15% 
So that you could take this bank note and buy something

543
00:30:12.513 --> 00:30:15.905 line:15% 
with it, and whoever accepted it could then take it to the

544
00:30:15.905 --> 00:30:17.166 line:15% 
bank and redeem it for gold.

545
00:30:17.166 --> 00:30:19.086 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Like you say, this has been going on for about</v>

546
00:30:19.086 --> 00:30:20.238
300 years plus now.

547
00:30:20.238 --> 00:30:23.349 line:15% 
<v ->Right, so we had commodity money then symbolic money.</v>

548
00:30:23.483 --> 00:30:26.161 line:15% 
But then, the banks created credit money.

549
00:30:26.161 --> 00:30:28.529 line:15% 
And this was a major leap forward, this was a good thing

550
00:30:28.529 --> 00:30:30.173 line:15% 
not a bad thing.

551
00:30:30.173 --> 00:30:34.865 line:15% 
The bad part about it was that it made it very easy

552
00:30:34.865 --> 00:30:38.019 line:15% 
for money to be manipulated and falsified.

553
00:30:38.813 --> 00:30:42.160 line:15% 
So, initially, the banks would issue bank notes, not on

554
00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:45.641 line:15% 
the basis of gold and silver on deposit, but on the basis

555
00:30:45.641 --> 00:30:48.567 line:15% 
of some other good collateral that you might be able to

556
00:30:48.567 --> 00:30:52.518 line:15% 
put up, like let's say the title to your farm or your home.

557
00:30:53.248 --> 00:30:56.960 line:15% 
So now, this credit money created a more flexible supply

558
00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.651 line:15% 
of money, because now you could take goods inventories

559
00:31:00.651 --> 00:31:03.851 line:15% 
for example, and issue money on the basis of those

560
00:31:03.851 --> 00:31:05.619 line:15% 
goods inventories.

561
00:31:05.619 --> 00:31:09.248 line:15% 
So now, a manufacture could take an invoice,

562
00:31:09.248 --> 00:31:12.851 line:15% 
a manufacturer selling goods to you, let's say a wholesaler

563
00:31:12.851 --> 00:31:15.584 line:15% 
could take the invoice once you acknowledge that you

564
00:31:15.584 --> 00:31:18.763 line:15% 
owe me the money, I could take that invoice to a bank and

565
00:31:18.763 --> 00:31:22.667 line:15% 
say would you discount this note and give me money now

566
00:31:22.667 --> 00:31:26.163 line:15% 
even though you have 30 days or 60 days to pay.

567
00:31:26.163 --> 00:31:29.259 line:15% 
So this provided a medium of exchange that was needed

568
00:31:29.259 --> 00:31:32.075 line:15% 
to circulate in the economy for those goods to be

569
00:31:32.075 --> 00:31:35.531 line:15% 
bought from the market, once they appeared in the market.

570
00:31:35.531 --> 00:31:38.771 line:15% 
So this was a good thing, but then banks began to

571
00:31:38.771 --> 00:31:41.503 line:15% 
manipulate this process, they began to issue money

572
00:31:41.503 --> 00:31:45.848 line:15% 
on the basis of no collateral or bad collateral,

573
00:31:47.562 --> 00:31:50.283 line:15% 
monetizing government bonds for example.

574
00:31:51.678 --> 00:31:55.663 line:15% 
And so, we had this potential for inflation.

575
00:31:56.674 --> 00:32:01.005 line:15% 
The debasement of the currency and the defeat of

576
00:32:01.005 --> 00:32:04.860 line:15% 
reciprocity, which is the intention of money to begin with.

577
00:32:06.957 --> 00:32:11.387 line:15% 
But now, we have the process of direct credit clearing.

578
00:32:11.693 --> 00:32:14.293 line:15% 
And when you think about what banks do, this is primarily

579
00:32:14.293 --> 00:32:16.897 line:15% 
what banks do today, it's direct credit clearing.

580
00:32:16.897 --> 00:32:18.992 line:15% 
Even though they like to pretend that money is still

581
00:32:18.992 --> 00:32:23.620 line:15% 
something that they're giving us, and something that

582
00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:25.873 line:15% 
deserves the payment of interest.

583
00:32:28.356 --> 00:32:31.812 line:15% 
So this credit clearing process, the fourth step in the

584
00:32:31.812 --> 00:32:36.177 line:15% 
evolutionary phase, is actually the end of money

585
00:32:36.207 --> 00:32:37.841 line:15% 
as we've known it.

586
00:32:37.999 --> 00:32:41.284 line:15% 
Because the process I described earlier, just a bookkeeping

587
00:32:41.284 --> 00:32:44.463 line:15% 
process of debits and credits, we know longer need

588
00:32:44.463 --> 00:32:48.233 line:15% 
political money, which is a third part credit instrument.

589
00:32:48.303 --> 00:32:50.967 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>And that's the beginning or future</v>

590
00:32:50.967 --> 00:32:51.991 line:15% 
of civilization.

591
00:32:51.991 --> 00:32:54.231 line:15% 
<v ->That's the future of civilization, because now,</v>

592
00:32:54.231 --> 00:32:59.231 line:15% 
it enables us to create an economy that is sustainable,

593
00:32:59.927 --> 00:33:04.151 line:15% 
that is under community control, that is not dominated

594
00:33:04.151 --> 00:33:07.991 line:15% 
by a few people who happen to be in charge of the

595
00:33:07.991 --> 00:33:09.673 line:15% 
monetary system.

596
00:33:10.191 --> 00:33:15.191 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>And as individuals in society, societies</v>

597
00:33:15.542 --> 00:33:19.663 line:15% 
around the planet that would like to see this kind of,

598
00:33:19.663 --> 00:33:22.863 line:15% 
I mean as you speak of it, it almost sounds Utopian.

599
00:33:22.863 --> 00:33:24.953 line:15% 
Of course there are going to be some major bumps

600
00:33:24.953 --> 00:33:28.513 line:15% 
in working our way toward this, we have a period of

601
00:33:28.513 --> 00:33:30.926 line:15% 
letting go to go through that could be very, very painful

602
00:33:30.926 --> 00:33:32.014 line:15% 
for a lot of people.

603
00:33:32.014 --> 00:33:35.449 line:15% 
We have to kind of look at that as just any part of

604
00:33:35.449 --> 00:33:39.265 line:15% 
any kind of transitional process, but once we can start

605
00:33:39.265 --> 00:33:42.233 line:15% 
looking at the other side and the potentials there,

606
00:33:42.233 --> 00:33:45.517 line:15% 
it is almost Utopian that we can start relaxing and

607
00:33:45.517 --> 00:33:48.461 line:15% 
having the security of knowing that our lives aren't just

608
00:33:48.461 --> 00:33:52.025 line:15% 
living at the bottom of that pyramid of hierarchy of

609
00:33:52.025 --> 00:33:55.737 line:15% 
values, that we can actually start investing in our

610
00:33:55.737 --> 00:33:59.769 line:15% 
self actualization, as you say, at the top and

611
00:33:59.769 --> 00:34:01.280 line:15% 
everything in between.

612
00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.393 line:15% 
How do we begin right now?

613
00:34:02.393 --> 00:34:06.336 line:15% 
What do we have to do as citizens of this planet, right now,

614
00:34:06.336 --> 00:34:09.241 line:15% 
to start working our way in that direction?

615
00:34:09.241 --> 00:34:11.881 line:15% 
<v ->We have to start at the community level.</v>

616
00:34:12.695 --> 00:34:15.683 line:15% 
We have to bring the whole community together,

617
00:34:15.683 --> 00:34:19.523 line:15% 
including the main stream business sector, mainly the

618
00:34:19.523 --> 00:34:23.446 line:15% 
small and medium sized businesses that provide 60 percent

619
00:34:23.446 --> 00:34:27.792 line:15% 
of the jobs, actually it may be even more than that,

620
00:34:28.527 --> 00:34:32.144 line:15% 
and most of the goods and services that we consume.

621
00:34:32.495 --> 00:34:35.139 line:15% 
We have to bring our communities together, the local

622
00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:38.422 line:15% 
government, local business community, the non profit

623
00:34:38.422 --> 00:34:42.288 line:15% 
organizations, the social service organizations,

624
00:34:44.047 --> 00:34:45.917
all of the things that constitute

625
00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:49.035 line:15% 
the social capitol of a community.

626
00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:53.693 line:15% 
We have to begin to build these economic entities

627
00:34:53.693 --> 00:34:58.148 line:15% 
within our communities, starting with mutual credit clearing

628
00:34:58.148 --> 00:35:01.131 line:15% 
systems to mediate the exchange function.

629
00:35:01.156 --> 00:35:02.865 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>And as you say, there are already</v>

630
00:35:02.865 --> 00:35:05.572 line:15% 
organizations in place that we can look to as models

631
00:35:05.572 --> 00:35:07.068 line:15% 
or plug into.

632
00:35:07.068 --> 00:35:09.713 line:15% 
<v ->We have plenty of historical experience with these</v>

633
00:35:09.713 --> 00:35:10.244 line:15% 
systems.

634
00:35:10.244 --> 00:35:11.441 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

635
00:35:11.441 --> 00:35:15.345 line:15% 
<v ->We've had the privilege of having some breathing</v>

636
00:35:15.345 --> 00:35:20.345 line:15% 
space over the last 30 or 40 years, with which to experiment

637
00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.446 line:15% 
and to learn how to do these things.

638
00:35:24.412 --> 00:35:26.928 line:15% 
But, there's a good example that goes all the way back to

639
00:35:26.928 --> 00:35:31.928 line:15% 
The Great Depression 75 years ago, it's called the Wir Back.

640
00:35:32.551 --> 00:35:34.292 line:15% 
That's W-I-R.

641
00:35:34.919 --> 00:35:39.629 line:15% 
It started as the Wir Business Cooperative Circle.

642
00:35:40.979 --> 00:35:43.282 line:15% 
And during the depression, there wasn't enough

643
00:35:43.282 --> 00:35:47.207 line:15% 
conventional money in circulation so business was bieng

644
00:35:47.207 --> 00:35:51.764 line:15% 
strapped and hog tied.

645
00:35:52.602 --> 00:35:56.914 line:15% 
What the small and medium sized business in Switzerland did,

646
00:35:56.914 --> 00:36:00.306 line:15% 
was they came together to figure out how can we continue to

647
00:36:00.306 --> 00:36:02.866 line:15% 
do business even though we don't have money?

648
00:36:02.866 --> 00:36:06.214 line:15% 
And they came up with this credit clearing approach.

649
00:36:06.214 --> 00:36:07.450 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

650
00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:11.482 line:15% 
<v ->So that's been in operation now for 75 years, and it's</v>

651
00:36:11.482 --> 00:36:14.124 line:15% 
been successful and growing.

652
00:36:16.282 --> 00:36:20.358 line:15% 
They're now doing about one and a third billion dollars

653
00:36:20.358 --> 00:36:24.902 line:15% 
worth of business among sixers and so we can imulate

654
00:36:24.902 --> 00:36:26.732 line:15% 
that process.

655
00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:30.002 line:15% 
They've worked out pretty much all of the bugs,

656
00:36:30.002 --> 00:36:32.467 line:15% 
not entirely, but most of them.

657
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:35.289 line:15% 
And we have the commercial credit clearing exchanges

658
00:36:35.289 --> 00:36:38.578 line:15% 
that I mentioned earlier, that have been operating

659
00:36:38.578 --> 00:36:42.284 line:15% 
successfully for several decades now.

660
00:36:42.649 --> 00:36:45.312 line:15% 
We can look to them,

661
00:36:45.638 --> 00:36:48.710 line:15% 
and learn from their experience and build on it.

662
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:51.289 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>And it seems like we also can take a little</v>

663
00:36:51.289 --> 00:36:53.337 line:15% 
time for reflection and look inside ourselves.

664
00:36:53.337 --> 00:36:55.769 line:15% 
What do I have to offer my community?

665
00:36:55.769 --> 00:36:58.393 line:15% 
If I come down to having to go into this type of

666
00:36:58.393 --> 00:37:00.465 line:15% 
credit system, my efforts have to go into this

667
00:37:00.465 --> 00:37:03.793 line:15% 
credit system, what do I have to offer of value

668
00:37:03.793 --> 00:37:05.113 line:15% 
within my own community?

669
00:37:05.113 --> 00:37:07.865 line:15% 
And start really looking at this in a new way.

670
00:37:07.865 --> 00:37:10.213 line:15% 
<v ->Exactly, we're going through some difficult times</v>

671
00:37:10.213 --> 00:37:15.213 line:15% 
right now, and the key to success is the diversification

672
00:37:16.377 --> 00:37:17.829 line:15% 
of skills and abilities.

673
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:19.065 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

674
00:37:19.065 --> 00:37:22.137 line:15% 
<v ->And so, I think we have to learn to do a lot of different</v>

675
00:37:22.137 --> 00:37:26.553 line:15% 
things, and to be in touch with what our community

676
00:37:26.553 --> 00:37:29.682 line:15% 
needs and find a way to supply it.

677
00:37:30.117 --> 00:37:34.085 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Well, very refreshing, I couldn't agree more</v>

678
00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:36.920 line:15% 
and it'll be very interesting to see how we all start

679
00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:39.973 line:15% 
co-creating this, however awkward it may be along

680
00:37:39.973 --> 00:37:43.384 line:15% 
the way to get going and thank you for your decades

681
00:37:43.384 --> 00:37:45.841 line:15% 
of work and reflection on this so you can bring us

682
00:37:45.841 --> 00:37:47.397 line:15% 
this articulate message.

683
00:37:47.397 --> 00:37:49.272 line:15% 
<v ->You're welcome, we should make sure that we have</v>

684
00:37:49.272 --> 00:37:50.448 line:15% 
fun in the process.

685
00:37:50.448 --> 00:37:52.152 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Yes, we should, absolutely, there's got</v>

686
00:37:52.152 --> 00:37:53.968 line:15% 
to be the fun factor.

687
00:37:53.968 --> 00:37:55.160 line:15% 
Thank you so much, Tom.

688
00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.588 line:15% 
<v ->You're welcome.</v>

689
00:37:57.318 --> 00:37:59.860 line:15% 
<v ->Because this subject is so at the core of our emotions</v>

690
00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.992 line:15% 
these days, we are going to be doing several more

691
00:38:01.992 --> 00:38:05.000 line:15% 
interviews on the topic and all of the creative endeavors

692
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.924 line:15% 
to ween us off the credit system of banking that are

693
00:38:07.924 --> 00:38:09.877 line:15% 
taking form as you watch this.

694
00:38:09.883 --> 00:38:11.931 line:15% 
Meanwhile, you can go to Tom's website at

695
00:38:11.931 --> 00:38:15.540 line:15% 
reinventingmoney.com to dig deeper into the subject

696
00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:18.459 line:15% 
and also purchase a copy of his book "The End of Money".

697
00:38:18.459 --> 00:38:21.525 line:15% 
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
