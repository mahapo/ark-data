00:00:00.691 --> 00:00:02.731
<v ->Hang on to your hats, because you're about to go</v>

2
00:00:02.731 --> 00:00:04.852
on a heck of a ride through time, space,

3
00:00:04.852 --> 00:00:06.412
and the multiverse.

4
00:00:06.412 --> 00:00:08.412
Doctor Michio Kaku has been described

5
00:00:08.412 --> 00:00:11.372
as today's Einstiein in many elite circles.

6
00:00:11.372 --> 00:00:13.633
Add his genius for comedy and passion

7
00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:16.174
for the new frontier of string field theory

8
00:00:16.174 --> 00:00:17.753
of which he is co-founder,

9
00:00:17.753 --> 00:00:19.513
and you have a veritable stand-up

10
00:00:19.513 --> 00:00:22.234
theoretical physicist comedian.

11
00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:24.993
Doctor Kaku takes subjects that are nearly impossible

12
00:00:24.993 --> 00:00:27.273
for our current minds to understand,

13
00:00:27.273 --> 00:00:29.673
and reduces them to common analogies,

14
00:00:29.673 --> 00:00:33.373
bringing incredibly exciting new possibilities for mankind,

15
00:00:33.373 --> 00:00:35.143
into clearer focus.

16
00:00:35.143 --> 00:00:37.664
All I can say is, have fun with this one.

17
00:00:37.664 --> 00:00:42.575 line:15% 
(serene music)

18
00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:48.513
<v Voiceover>You hopscotched humanity through</v>

19
00:00:48.513 --> 00:00:49.475
our phases of evolution.

20
00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:50.135
<v ->Right.</v>

21
00:00:50.135 --> 00:00:51.315
<v Voiceover>From where we are now,</v>

22
00:00:51.315 --> 00:00:52.935
which seems somewhat primitive

23
00:00:52.935 --> 00:00:54.076
on a large cosmic scale.

24
00:00:54.076 --> 00:00:55.136
<v ->Right.</v>

25
00:00:55.136 --> 00:00:56.796
<v Voiceover>And through this journey,</v>

26
00:00:56.796 --> 00:00:58.416
you talk about our interface.

27
00:00:58.599 --> 00:01:00.963
Our conscious interface with technology.

28
00:01:01.573 --> 00:01:04.233
Including the world of computers, et cetera.

29
00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:06.938
Can you speak to that a little bit right now

30
00:01:06.938 --> 00:01:08.778
in terms of where you think we're going

31
00:01:08.778 --> 00:01:10.755
in a not too distant future

32
00:01:10.755 --> 00:01:12.535
in our interface with technology,

33
00:01:12.535 --> 00:01:14.336
and then we're gonna go on from there?

34
00:01:15.097 --> 00:01:19.057
<v ->Well we physicists have asked about what civilization</v>

35
00:01:19.057 --> 00:01:21.996
will look like, 100, 1,000,

36
00:01:21.996 --> 00:01:25.173
a million years beyond our technology.

37
00:01:25.173 --> 00:01:27.192
And we'll be looking outer space,

38
00:01:27.192 --> 00:01:30.693
we actually look for paradigms that we may see.

39
00:01:30.693 --> 00:01:33.293
We look for what they call type one, type two,

40
00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:35.104
and type three civilizations.

41
00:01:35.104 --> 00:01:36.864
We don't look for little green men,

42
00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:39.344
we look for the energy signature

43
00:01:39.344 --> 00:01:43.554
of planetary, stellar, and galactic civilizations.

44
00:01:44.124 --> 00:01:45.644
<v Voiceover>Where are we in that mix right now?</v>

45
00:01:45.644 --> 00:01:47.924
<v ->Well, first of all type one civilization</v>

46
00:01:47.924 --> 00:01:50.185
is a planetary civilization.

47
00:01:50.185 --> 00:01:52.265
They control the weather,

48
00:01:52.265 --> 00:01:54.285
they control earthquakes, volcanoes,

49
00:01:54.285 --> 00:01:57.565
anything planetary they would control.

50
00:01:57.565 --> 00:02:00.365
Sooner or later they exhaust the power of a planet,

51
00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:03.245
hurricanes and tornadoes are child's play for them,

52
00:02:03.245 --> 00:02:06.264
and eventually start to use the power of their star,

53
00:02:06.264 --> 00:02:08.744
not just to get a sun tan,

54
00:02:08.744 --> 00:02:10.764
but to play with solar flares.

55
00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:13.145
To literally play with with the entire star,

56
00:02:13.145 --> 00:02:16.424
to ignite stars, to play with stars,

57
00:02:16.424 --> 00:02:19.995
like we play with coal or our fire.

58
00:02:20.225 --> 00:02:23.113
Eventually they exhaust the power of a star,

59
00:02:23.113 --> 00:02:24.733
and they become galactic.

60
00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:27.933
They begin to colonize huge sections of the galaxy,

61
00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:30.193
and they start to use black holes for example

62
00:02:30.193 --> 00:02:32.432
as their primary energy supply.

63
00:02:32.432 --> 00:02:35.592
Now if you look at this scale,

64
00:02:35.592 --> 00:02:37.533
then you have to wonder where are we?

65
00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:40.494
We are type zero, we get our energy

66
00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:43.644
from dead plants, oil, and coal.

67
00:02:44.114 --> 00:02:46.894
However with a calculator,

68
00:02:46.894 --> 00:02:49.275
you can calculate when we will advance

69
00:02:49.275 --> 00:02:51.005
to these various stages.

70
00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:53.395
If we simply grow at 3% a year,

71
00:02:53.395 --> 00:02:55.275
which is very modest economic growth,

72
00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:57.915
then energy consumption also grows at 3%,

73
00:02:57.915 --> 00:03:00.826
and we will hit type one in about 100 years.

74
00:03:01.235 --> 00:03:03.235
Now you can already see the emergence

75
00:03:03.235 --> 00:03:06.435
of a type one civilization everywhere you go.

76
00:03:06.435 --> 00:03:07.855
When I open the newspaper,

77
00:03:07.855 --> 00:03:10.539
every single headline talks about

78
00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:13.819
the birth pang of a type on civilization being born,

79
00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.101
right before our eyes.

80
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:16.140
<v Voiceover>What does that look like.</v>

81
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.220
<v ->First of all, the internet, what is the internet?</v>

82
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.481
The internet is a type one telephone system,

83
00:03:20.481 --> 00:03:21.560
that's all it is.

84
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.160
We are privileged to be alive to see the birth

85
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.640
of a new planetary type one telephone system.

86
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.960
The language of type one is already out there,

87
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.521
most elites already speak English.

88
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:35.566
You can go anywhere on the planet earth,

89
00:03:35.566 --> 00:03:38.846
scientific elite, business elite, cultural elite,

90
00:03:38.846 --> 00:03:40.526
and they all speak English.

91
00:03:40.526 --> 00:03:42.387
So we're already beginning to see a planetary

92
00:03:42.387 --> 00:03:43.926
language being formed.

93
00:03:43.926 --> 00:03:46.466
A planetary economy is also being formed,

94
00:03:46.466 --> 00:03:47.946
look at the European Union.

95
00:03:47.946 --> 00:03:49.946
These nations have killed each other

96
00:03:49.946 --> 00:03:51.547
for the last 5,000 years

97
00:03:51.547 --> 00:03:53.807
ever since the last ice age melted, ended,

98
00:03:53.807 --> 00:03:55.727
and why are they banding together

99
00:03:55.727 --> 00:03:57.427
to form the European Union?

100
00:03:57.427 --> 00:03:59.547
To oppose us, and who is us?

101
00:03:59.547 --> 00:04:01.347
We are NAFTA, okay?

102
00:04:01.347 --> 00:04:03.867
So you see the emergence of a type one

103
00:04:03.867 --> 00:04:05.327
economy emerging.

104
00:04:05.327 --> 00:04:06.946
<v Voiceover>And globalization and outsourcing</v>

105
00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:07.888
is part of this?

106
00:04:07.888 --> 00:04:09.610
<v ->A tiny weeny part, just a small part.</v>

107
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.931
People react to globalization,

108
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:12.992
they don't realize it's much bigger

109
00:04:12.992 --> 00:04:15.078
than just globalization.

110
00:04:15.078 --> 00:04:17.618
We also see the beginning of a type one culture.

111
00:04:18.448 --> 00:04:20.299
You can go anywhere on the planet earth,

112
00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.626
and show people two pictures of a man and a woman,

113
00:04:22.626 --> 00:04:25.626
instantly recognizable by anyone on the planet earth,

114
00:04:25.626 --> 00:04:27.747
Madonna and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

115
00:04:27.747 --> 00:04:30.348
So my God, you now know what type one

116
00:04:30.348 --> 00:04:31.688
culture looks like.

117
00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:34.728
It's gonna be rock-n-roll, blue jeans, rap music,

118
00:04:34.728 --> 00:04:36.987
hip-hop, youth culture.

119
00:04:36.987 --> 00:04:39.668
That's gonna be the currency, the language

120
00:04:39.668 --> 00:04:42.348
that this type one civilization if going to speak,

121
00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:44.458
going to enjoy.

122
00:04:44.588 --> 00:04:46.588
So we're already beginning to see the beginnings

123
00:04:46.588 --> 00:04:50.788
of a type one culture, entertainment, language,

124
00:04:50.788 --> 00:04:55.228
energy supply, politics, beginning of a language,

125
00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:57.848
and the beginning of, just the beginning

126
00:04:57.848 --> 00:04:59.389
of a type one system.

127
00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.309
Now we are type zero,

128
00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:04.828
so the transition between type zero to type one

129
00:05:04.828 --> 00:05:06.251
is the most important transition

130
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:09.102
in all of human civilization.

131
00:05:09.471 --> 00:05:11.971
Think about it, it's the most dangerous

132
00:05:11.971 --> 00:05:14.071
of all transitions, because there are some people

133
00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:16.011
who don't wanna be in type one.

134
00:05:16.011 --> 00:05:19.071
They instinctively in their gut know

135
00:05:19.071 --> 00:05:21.871
that a type one system will be a system

136
00:05:21.871 --> 00:05:26.151
of different discourses, of different ideas,

137
00:05:26.151 --> 00:05:29.563
and clashes of ideas, and so on, and so forth.

138
00:05:29.563 --> 00:05:30.884
And these people who don't want

139
00:05:30.884 --> 00:05:32.604
this transition are the terrorists.

140
00:05:32.604 --> 00:05:34.764
In their gut, the terrorists know that

141
00:05:34.764 --> 00:05:36.104
we are headed for type one.

142
00:05:36.104 --> 00:05:37.324
They can't articulate it,

143
00:05:37.324 --> 00:05:40.324
they don't know the larger outlines of it,

144
00:05:40.324 --> 00:05:42.204
but in their gut they don't like it.

145
00:05:42.204 --> 00:05:44.744
They would rather be in type minus one.

146
00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:47.424
So however I believe that this transition

147
00:05:47.424 --> 00:05:49.126
from type zero to type one

148
00:05:49.126 --> 00:05:50.686
is the most important transition

149
00:05:50.686 --> 00:05:52.806
in the history of human civilization,

150
00:05:52.806 --> 00:05:55.006
and we are privileged to be alive

151
00:05:55.006 --> 00:05:57.506
to see the beginning of this transition.

152
00:05:57.506 --> 00:06:00.286
Our children, and our grand children

153
00:06:00.286 --> 00:06:02.686
will complete the greatest transition

154
00:06:02.686 --> 00:06:04.486
in the history of the human race.

155
00:06:04.486 --> 00:06:07.006
<v Voiceover>Is this not inspired by absolute necessity</v>

156
00:06:07.006 --> 00:06:08.933
because we can't live off of dead animals

157
00:06:08.933 --> 00:06:12.953
and dead plants, and fossil fuels indefinitely,

158
00:06:12.953 --> 00:06:14.815
is that kind of a negative point?

159
00:06:14.815 --> 00:06:16.055
<v ->It's being forced upon us.</v>

160
00:06:16.055 --> 00:06:16.695
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

161
00:06:16.695 --> 00:06:17.835
<v ->In other words, some people say,</v>

162
00:06:17.835 --> 00:06:19.134
let's try to stop the clock,

163
00:06:19.134 --> 00:06:20.294
maybe we don't wanna be part

164
00:06:20.294 --> 00:06:22.607
of a planetary civilization, it's too late.

165
00:06:22.607 --> 00:06:24.807
Look at the economies of the world,

166
00:06:24.807 --> 00:06:26.787
like I said, European Union is forming

167
00:06:26.787 --> 00:06:29.247
without anyone pushing them in that direction,

168
00:06:29.247 --> 00:06:31.147
cause they know it's either the European Union

169
00:06:31.147 --> 00:06:32.927
for Europe or else they gonna be wiped out

170
00:06:32.927 --> 00:06:34.947
by competition from the United States,

171
00:06:34.947 --> 00:06:36.467
China, and India.

172
00:06:36.467 --> 00:06:38.847
And we already see the young people of the world

173
00:06:38.847 --> 00:06:40.827
yearning to get on the internet,

174
00:06:40.827 --> 00:06:42.229
yearning to find out what other

175
00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:43.669
young people are doing.

176
00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:45.549
Cause young people instinctively know

177
00:06:45.549 --> 00:06:46.729
this is their future.

178
00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:47.690
They instinctively know,

179
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.270
I wanna be part of this future.

180
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.510
And so I think that terrorists would like

181
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.110
to prevent the transition,

182
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.971
but I don't think they're going to,

183
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:57.811
but it's gonna be a rocky transition,

184
00:06:57.811 --> 00:06:59.731
because we do have nuclear weapons,

185
00:06:59.731 --> 00:07:02.591
we do have biotech technology, designer germs.

186
00:07:03.592 --> 00:07:06.953
And so it may not be a transition

187
00:07:06.953 --> 00:07:08.833
that's fully guaranteed.

188
00:07:08.833 --> 00:07:11.472
However it's a very interesting transition,

189
00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:13.932
because even film makers have been interested

190
00:07:13.932 --> 00:07:15.373
in this transition.

191
00:07:15.373 --> 00:07:17.673
Think of a movie that talks about

192
00:07:17.673 --> 00:07:20.353
the most scientifically realistic encounter

193
00:07:20.353 --> 00:07:23.552
with another intelligent life form in the universe.

194
00:07:23.552 --> 00:07:27.733
In this movie, we realize that Captain Kirk

195
00:07:27.733 --> 00:07:30.823
in The Enterprise is the most inefficient

196
00:07:30.823 --> 00:07:33.093
way to explore outer space,

197
00:07:33.093 --> 00:07:35.013
hopping from planet to planet.

198
00:07:35.013 --> 00:07:38.100
There are 100 billion stars in our milky way galaxy,

199
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.040
perhaps half of those stars have planets

200
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.281
that's 50 million planets in our galaxy alone.

201
00:07:44.281 --> 00:07:45.980
The most efficient way for a type three

202
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.741
galactic civilization to explore their backyard,

203
00:07:49.741 --> 00:07:52.531
is with Von Neumann probes.

204
00:07:52.781 --> 00:07:55.101
Von Neumann probes are self replicating machines,

205
00:07:55.101 --> 00:07:56.181
they're robots.

206
00:07:56.181 --> 00:07:58.460
They land on the moon because the moon is stable,

207
00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.831
there's no erosion,

208
00:07:59.831 --> 00:08:02.103
You can stay there for millions of years,

209
00:08:02.103 --> 00:08:04.113
and it makes a carbon copy of itself.

210
00:08:04.443 --> 00:08:05.923
And in fact, it makes a factory that makes

211
00:08:05.923 --> 00:08:08.503
millions of copies of itself.

212
00:08:08.503 --> 00:08:10.783
These robot probes then shoot out

213
00:08:10.783 --> 00:08:12.363
and land on other moons.

214
00:08:12.363 --> 00:08:14.144
Each one makes a million copies

215
00:08:14.144 --> 00:08:16.024
of itself on a moon,

216
00:08:16.024 --> 00:08:18.264
and then shoots out a million more.

217
00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:21.364
So starting with one, you have a million probes,

218
00:08:21.364 --> 00:08:23.583
landing on a million moons,

219
00:08:23.583 --> 00:08:25.623
and you got a 1,000,000, 1,000,000 probes,

220
00:08:25.623 --> 00:08:27.544
and then a million million million probes,

221
00:08:27.544 --> 00:08:30.201
until you have a sphere expanding

222
00:08:30.201 --> 00:08:31.661
at the speed of light,

223
00:08:31.661 --> 00:08:34.511
containing these Von Neumann probes.

224
00:08:34.761 --> 00:08:35.941
Now what do they do?

225
00:08:35.941 --> 00:08:37.741
They land on a moon and they simply wait.

226
00:08:37.741 --> 00:08:40.341
They wait for a type zero civilization

227
00:08:40.341 --> 00:08:41.881
to become type one.

228
00:08:41.881 --> 00:08:44.401
Type zero is not so interesting,

229
00:08:44.401 --> 00:08:47.781
you have lot of fights, a lot of wars,

230
00:08:47.781 --> 00:08:50.161
a lot of competing ideas, and stuff.

231
00:08:50.161 --> 00:08:53.081
Type one is planetary, very civilized,

232
00:08:53.081 --> 00:08:55.201
very high level of science,

233
00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.861
very high level of an economy.

234
00:08:57.861 --> 00:08:59.621
And so the probes simply wait,

235
00:09:00.603 --> 00:09:02.463
until the civilization makes a transition

236
00:09:02.463 --> 00:09:04.503
from type zero to type one.

237
00:09:04.503 --> 00:09:06.583
Now where have we seen that before?

238
00:09:06.583 --> 00:09:08.482
We've all seen this before,

239
00:09:08.482 --> 00:09:10.562
this is the movie 2001.

240
00:09:10.562 --> 00:09:12.883
Because Danny Kubrick in the first

241
00:09:12.883 --> 00:09:14.443
five minutes of his film,

242
00:09:14.443 --> 00:09:17.103
interviewed all the top astronomers,

243
00:09:17.103 --> 00:09:18.543
cosmologists, and physicists,

244
00:09:18.543 --> 00:09:19.883
and asked them a question,

245
00:09:19.883 --> 00:09:22.423
what is the most realistic encounter

246
00:09:22.423 --> 00:09:24.843
with a type three civilization?

247
00:09:24.843 --> 00:09:26.203
And we laid it out.

248
00:09:26.203 --> 00:09:28.003
They will land on our moon,

249
00:09:28.003 --> 00:09:30.183
our moon is stable, no erosion.

250
00:09:30.183 --> 00:09:32.282
The would then build factories,

251
00:09:32.282 --> 00:09:35.223
waiting for a type zero civilization

252
00:09:35.223 --> 00:09:36.685
to become type one.

253
00:09:36.685 --> 00:09:38.825
And if you saw the movie,

254
00:09:38.825 --> 00:09:40.924
there is an instant where the astronaut

255
00:09:40.924 --> 00:09:42.764
touches the monolith.

256
00:09:42.764 --> 00:09:44.244
And he goes like this,

257
00:09:44.244 --> 00:09:46.004
because an alarm clock goes off.

258
00:09:46.004 --> 00:09:48.904
And the alarm clock signals back to the home race,

259
00:09:48.904 --> 00:09:50.564
we have come of age.

260
00:09:50.564 --> 00:09:53.685
Well Kubrick and and Arthur C. Clarke

261
00:09:53.685 --> 00:09:55.405
were off by 100 years.

262
00:09:55.405 --> 00:09:58.545
It's not gonna be the year 2001,

263
00:09:58.545 --> 00:10:01.325
it's gonna be 2101.

264
00:10:01.346 --> 00:10:03.966
In 100 years, we will be type one,

265
00:10:03.966 --> 00:10:06.086
we will have an operating moon base.

266
00:10:06.086 --> 00:10:07.506
How long will it take for us to get

267
00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:08.706
an operating moon base,

268
00:10:08.706 --> 00:10:11.086
24 hour, 24-7 moon base?

269
00:10:11.086 --> 00:10:12.526
Another 100 years.

270
00:10:12.526 --> 00:10:14.607
And so I think we're right on schedule.

271
00:10:14.607 --> 00:10:17.507
So maybe on our moon, there's already,

272
00:10:17.507 --> 00:10:18.507
who knows?

273
00:10:18.507 --> 00:10:20.007
There is already perhaps a presence

274
00:10:20.007 --> 00:10:21.647
of an extraterrestrial visitation.

275
00:10:21.647 --> 00:10:25.028
<v Voiceover>There have been photographs,</v>

276
00:10:25.028 --> 00:10:26.869
and essays, and et cetera,

277
00:10:26.869 --> 00:10:29.869
written on a subject of having potential

278
00:10:29.869 --> 00:10:31.689
discoveries of structures already existing

279
00:10:31.689 --> 00:10:32.529
on the moon.

280
00:10:32.529 --> 00:10:33.629
How true might that be?

281
00:10:33.629 --> 00:10:34.589
<v ->Well you see,</v>

282
00:10:34.589 --> 00:10:36.269
we have no operating moon base,

283
00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:38.809
we simply landed on the moon a few times,

284
00:10:38.809 --> 00:10:40.809
and therefore we don't know

285
00:10:40.809 --> 00:10:42.529
what kind of energy sources there are,

286
00:10:42.529 --> 00:10:44.269
we haven't scanned the moon.

287
00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:45.969
We don't really have a good picture

288
00:10:45.969 --> 00:10:47.329
of what's inside the moon,

289
00:10:47.329 --> 00:10:50.089
or what probes may exist there.

290
00:10:50.089 --> 00:10:52.209
There could be a probe from a type three

291
00:10:52.209 --> 00:10:54.609
galactic civilization sitting on the moon,

292
00:10:54.609 --> 00:10:55.929
and we'd never know it.

293
00:10:55.929 --> 00:10:56.371
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

294
00:10:56.371 --> 00:10:58.410
<v ->Plus they may have nanotechnology.</v>

295
00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:00.010
With nanotechnology you don't have to have

296
00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:01.992
Captain Kirk and The Enterprise,

297
00:11:01.992 --> 00:11:04.131
they could be as big as a bread box.

298
00:11:04.131 --> 00:11:06.092
You could have miniaturized probes

299
00:11:06.092 --> 00:11:09.111
that are part organic, part DNA,

300
00:11:09.111 --> 00:11:10.671
and part silicon.

301
00:11:10.671 --> 00:11:12.992
A merger of carbon and silicon.

302
00:11:12.992 --> 00:11:15.392
In a device perhaps no bigger than

303
00:11:15.392 --> 00:11:17.291
you know, a bread box,

304
00:11:17.291 --> 00:11:19.391
sitting on our moon, just waiting for us

305
00:11:19.391 --> 00:11:20.931
to make contact with it,

306
00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:23.221
waiting for us to become type one.

307
00:11:23.611 --> 00:11:25.571
<v Voiceover>What about the, since we're on Hollywood,</v>

308
00:11:25.571 --> 00:11:26.952
what about The Matrix?

309
00:11:26.952 --> 00:11:30.053
Now, that really engaged an awful lot of minds,

310
00:11:30.053 --> 00:11:32.518
particularly those in their 20s and 30s.

311
00:11:32.518 --> 00:11:35.099
What is your experience with those

312
00:11:35.099 --> 00:11:37.559
kinds of potential realities,

313
00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:39.819
and how do you describe where that came from,

314
00:11:39.819 --> 00:11:41.559
and what that's leading us to?

315
00:11:41.559 --> 00:11:43.339
<v ->Well there are two aspects of The Matrix,</v>

316
00:11:43.339 --> 00:11:45.179
one is whether or not is physically possible

317
00:11:45.179 --> 00:11:48.519
to have virtual reality indistinguishable

318
00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:50.279
from ordinary reality.

319
00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:51.478
And second of all,

320
00:11:51.478 --> 00:11:53.259
will the machines take over, okay?

321
00:11:53.259 --> 00:11:55.475
So let's talk about them one at the time.

322
00:11:56.805 --> 00:11:58.595
Our most advanced robots,

323
00:11:58.595 --> 00:12:02.837
have the collective wisdom of a retarded cockroach.

324
00:12:02.837 --> 00:12:04.559
(interviewer chuckles)

325
00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:05.879
Not an ordinary cockroach.

326
00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:06.858
(interviewer chuckles)

327
00:12:06.858 --> 00:12:09.428
A retarded lobotomized cockroach.

328
00:12:09.782 --> 00:12:11.922
<v Voiceover>So we're not in danger yet, go ahead.</v>

329
00:12:11.922 --> 00:12:13.562
<v ->From my book Visions,</v>

330
00:12:13.562 --> 00:12:16.062
I interviewed 150 of the world's top scientists,

331
00:12:16.062 --> 00:12:18.502
these are the directors of all the major

332
00:12:18.502 --> 00:12:21.102
science laboratories, these are nobel laureates.

333
00:12:21.102 --> 00:12:22.642
I interviewed Rodney Brooks,

334
00:12:22.642 --> 00:12:24.282
who is the director of the

335
00:12:24.282 --> 00:12:26.221
MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,

336
00:12:26.221 --> 00:12:29.152
the number one laboratory in the world.

337
00:12:29.442 --> 00:12:31.281
And I asked him, well how long will it take

338
00:12:31.281 --> 00:12:32.962
before our most advanced robots

339
00:12:32.962 --> 00:12:34.824
become as intelligent as us.

340
00:12:34.824 --> 00:12:36.404
And he said, well first of all,

341
00:12:36.404 --> 00:12:39.064
our most advanced robots is on Mars,

342
00:12:39.064 --> 00:12:41.625
it's his godchild in some sense,

343
00:12:41.625 --> 00:12:42.804
it's the Mars Rover.

344
00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:45.345
It's a real automaton.

345
00:12:45.345 --> 00:12:46.805
So I asked him, well how intelligent

346
00:12:46.805 --> 00:12:48.985
is your grandchild, the Mars Rover?

347
00:12:48.985 --> 00:12:51.644
And he said, well you know, a cockroach,

348
00:12:52.045 --> 00:12:54.726
you know, a slow cockroach,

349
00:12:54.726 --> 00:12:57.186
a slow learning cockroach, okay?

350
00:12:57.186 --> 00:12:58.846
Now a cockroach you know,

351
00:12:58.846 --> 00:13:01.266
on a table, you raise your hand,

352
00:13:01.266 --> 00:13:02.866
a cockroach scans your hand

353
00:13:02.866 --> 00:13:04.146
as danger, danger, danger,

354
00:13:04.146 --> 00:13:06.786
runs into the cracks.

355
00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:08.026
I know, I used to live in a house

356
00:13:08.026 --> 00:13:09.588
with lots of cockroaches.

357
00:13:09.588 --> 00:13:11.908
However, you know, the Mars rover,

358
00:13:11.908 --> 00:13:13.707
if you were to raise your tentacle

359
00:13:13.707 --> 00:13:15.089
to Mars Rover on Mars,

360
00:13:15.089 --> 00:13:17.096
it would scan the tentacle and say,

361
00:13:17.096 --> 00:13:18.558
is that a dog?

362
00:13:18.558 --> 00:13:20.098
No, not a dog.

363
00:13:20.098 --> 00:13:21.257
Is that a giraffe?

364
00:13:21.257 --> 00:13:22.157
No, not a dog.

365
00:13:22.157 --> 00:13:24.517
Six hours later, it would still be wondering

366
00:13:24.517 --> 00:13:26.118
you know, is that a cow?

367
00:13:26.118 --> 00:13:28.459
Meanwhile the alien would have gone whack.

368
00:13:28.459 --> 00:13:30.791
It takes six hours for our most advanced robots

369
00:13:30.791 --> 00:13:32.072
to walk across the room,

370
00:13:32.072 --> 00:13:34.907
six hours for them to scan the room.

371
00:13:34.907 --> 00:13:36.127
The robot has to figure out

372
00:13:36.127 --> 00:13:37.627
where is up, where is down?

373
00:13:37.627 --> 00:13:39.647
Here is a rectangle, is it a table,

374
00:13:39.647 --> 00:13:41.986
or is it a square, or is it a pie,

375
00:13:41.986 --> 00:13:43.946
a plate, or what is it?

376
00:13:43.946 --> 00:13:46.366
The robot would scan a cup,

377
00:13:46.876 --> 00:13:48.767
and it would understand all the triangles

378
00:13:48.767 --> 00:13:51.366
and circles, and cylinders of a cup perfectly,

379
00:13:51.366 --> 00:13:53.071
but to see it better than us?

380
00:13:53.071 --> 00:13:54.772
But it would take hours

381
00:13:54.772 --> 00:13:57.715
for it to finally say, ah, cup.

382
00:13:58.045 --> 00:13:59.195
Cup.

383
00:13:59.427 --> 00:14:00.367
You know what I'm saying?

384
00:14:00.367 --> 00:14:01.027
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

385
00:14:01.027 --> 00:14:02.188
<v ->Robots don't have common sense.</v>

386
00:14:02.188 --> 00:14:03.109
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

387
00:14:03.109 --> 00:14:04.869
<v ->They don't know that water is wet.</v>

388
00:14:04.869 --> 00:14:06.630
They don't know that mothers are older

389
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:07.630
than their daughters.

390
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.630
They don't know that animals are not like pain.

391
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:10.714
They don't know that when you die

392
00:14:10.714 --> 00:14:12.074
you don't come back the next day.

393
00:14:12.074 --> 00:14:13.693
They don't know that strings can pull,

394
00:14:13.693 --> 00:14:14.826
strings cannot push.

395
00:14:14.826 --> 00:14:17.126
They don't know that sticks can push

396
00:14:17.126 --> 00:14:18.606
but cannot pull.

397
00:14:18.606 --> 00:14:19.647
Robots don't know that.

398
00:14:19.647 --> 00:14:20.500
<v Voiceover>Still they're not poised</v>

399
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.620
to take over just yet?

400
00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.140
<v ->Yeah.</v>

401
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.040
<v Voiceover>But let's talk about more realistic interface</v>

402
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.515
with technology, which is the interface

403
00:14:26.515 --> 00:14:29.215
between human consciousness and say,

404
00:14:29.215 --> 00:14:31.475
nanotechnology in the world of computers.

405
00:14:31.475 --> 00:14:33.336
You talked about this a little bit in Visions.

406
00:14:33.336 --> 00:14:36.255
<v ->Well there is gonna be a gradual merger</v>

407
00:14:36.255 --> 00:14:39.275
of silicon and carbon in the future, okay?

408
00:14:40.218 --> 00:14:42.237
It's already happening.

409
00:14:42.237 --> 00:14:44.877
People already living with artificial parts

410
00:14:44.877 --> 00:14:46.139
in the their body,

411
00:14:46.139 --> 00:14:47.819
and we love it.

412
00:14:47.819 --> 00:14:50.398
Because either that or else be paralyzed,

413
00:14:50.398 --> 00:14:54.588
either that or else not have use of your arms and legs.

414
00:14:55.078 --> 00:14:59.278
So, and also DNA technology is getting

415
00:14:59.278 --> 00:15:01.478
to the point where it will eventually

416
00:15:01.478 --> 00:15:02.998
interphase with silicon.

417
00:15:02.998 --> 00:15:04.858
Now of course this is far in the future,

418
00:15:04.858 --> 00:15:07.566
and I think that society has to democratically,

419
00:15:07.566 --> 00:15:10.286
democratically have a consensus as to how far

420
00:15:10.286 --> 00:15:12.251
to push this thing, okay?

421
00:15:12.251 --> 00:15:14.211
So I think that is gonna be one

422
00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:16.710
direction that we're gonna go into.

423
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:18.810
Another direction is pure silicon,

424
00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.670
Asimov wrote about the three laws of robotics

425
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.650
to protect us against dangerous machines.

426
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:25.830
Our most advanced robot

427
00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.551
has the intelligence of a cockroach.

428
00:15:27.551 --> 00:15:29.271
I suspect that about 20 years,

429
00:15:29.271 --> 00:15:30.990
they'll probably be as intelligent

430
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.528
as a dog or a cat.

431
00:15:33.528 --> 00:15:36.048
And perhaps in 30 or 40 years,

432
00:15:36.048 --> 00:15:36.930
they'll probably be as intelligent

433
00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:38.310
as a monkey.

434
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.452
At that point, they could get a little dangerous,

435
00:15:40.452 --> 00:15:43.092
cause monkeys do have their own agenda,

436
00:15:43.092 --> 00:15:44.972
they have their own plans,

437
00:15:44.972 --> 00:15:47.252
their own goals, okay?

438
00:15:47.252 --> 00:15:48.692
Dogs and cats may not,

439
00:15:48.692 --> 00:15:50.292
but monkeys probably do.

440
00:15:50.292 --> 00:15:52.292
At that point I think we have plenty of time

441
00:15:52.292 --> 00:15:54.433
to put a chip in their brain, to shut them off,

442
00:15:54.433 --> 00:15:56.514
if they have any murderous thoughts.

443
00:15:56.514 --> 00:15:58.174
So I think there is plenty of time,

444
00:15:58.174 --> 00:15:59.754
we don't have to say, oh my God,

445
00:15:59.754 --> 00:16:01.515
you know, one day a robot will wake up

446
00:16:01.515 --> 00:16:03.554
and will be conscious, and take over the world.

447
00:16:03.554 --> 00:16:05.914
It'll be decades of experimentation

448
00:16:05.914 --> 00:16:07.754
with cat-like, dog-like robots,

449
00:16:07.754 --> 00:16:10.094
leading to monkey-like robots,

450
00:16:10.094 --> 00:16:11.934
before we have to worry about them.

451
00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:15.615
<v Voiceover>Let's jump now then from that</v>

452
00:16:15.615 --> 00:16:18.035
to the subject of your latest book,

453
00:16:18.035 --> 00:16:20.836
Parallel Worlds, and talking about

454
00:16:20.836 --> 00:16:24.476
going from a concept of universe to multiverse.

455
00:16:24.476 --> 00:16:26.416
What does this mean?

456
00:16:26.416 --> 00:16:30.156
And what is it mean to be multi-dimensional,

457
00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:32.636
and how is this something that we

458
00:16:32.636 --> 00:16:34.996
can take into consideration in our lives now,

459
00:16:34.996 --> 00:16:36.077
as we're struggling to go out of

460
00:16:36.077 --> 00:16:37.417
a zero to a one?

461
00:16:37.417 --> 00:16:39.897
<v ->Well right now where we're rewriting</v>

462
00:16:39.897 --> 00:16:42.997
all the textbooks, and astronomy, and cosmology.

463
00:16:42.997 --> 00:16:45.357
Cosmology is going through three revolutions,

464
00:16:45.357 --> 00:16:47.897
the first revolution was initiated by Galileo,

465
00:16:47.897 --> 00:16:49.717
who turned the telescope to the sky

466
00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:50.937
and revealed for the first time

467
00:16:50.937 --> 00:16:53.277
the true splendor of the night sky.

468
00:16:53.277 --> 00:16:55.797
The second revolution was in the 1920s

469
00:16:55.797 --> 00:16:58.477
with the giant telescopes like Mount Wilson,

470
00:16:58.477 --> 00:17:00.417
where Edwin Hubble showed that

471
00:17:00.417 --> 00:17:02.337
the universe was expanding.

472
00:17:02.337 --> 00:17:03.797
So we have this picture,

473
00:17:03.797 --> 00:17:05.077
this picture that the universe

474
00:17:05.077 --> 00:17:08.217
is in some sense a soap bubble of some sort,

475
00:17:08.217 --> 00:17:09.857
and it's expanding,

476
00:17:09.857 --> 00:17:11.557
and it's slowing down.

477
00:17:11.557 --> 00:17:13.737
And the soap bubble is made out of atoms,

478
00:17:13.737 --> 00:17:14.558
cause everywhere we look,

479
00:17:14.558 --> 00:17:16.758
we see atoms of hydrogen, helium,

480
00:17:16.758 --> 00:17:17.998
and so on, and so forth.

481
00:17:17.998 --> 00:17:20.678
Well that picture we now know is wrong.

482
00:17:20.678 --> 00:17:23.458
Every single cosmology textbook

483
00:17:23.458 --> 00:17:25.458
on the earth is being rewritten,

484
00:17:25.458 --> 00:17:26.578
because we're now entering

485
00:17:26.578 --> 00:17:28.738
the third era, satellites.

486
00:17:28.738 --> 00:17:31.258
Satellites have forced us to confront

487
00:17:31.258 --> 00:17:33.978
the fact that we may not be alone,

488
00:17:33.978 --> 00:17:35.498
that our universe may not

489
00:17:35.498 --> 00:17:37.458
be made out of atoms.

490
00:17:37.458 --> 00:17:39.718
So first of all, our satellites have shown that

491
00:17:39.718 --> 00:17:42.478
most of the universe is not made out of atoms.

492
00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:43.798
Every textbook is wrong,

493
00:17:43.798 --> 00:17:45.538
every chemistry class is wrong.

494
00:17:45.538 --> 00:17:47.738
Your high school chemistry teacher was wrong

495
00:17:47.738 --> 00:17:49.678
in saying that everything is made out of atoms.

496
00:17:49.678 --> 00:17:51.038
We now know that most of the universe

497
00:17:51.038 --> 00:17:53.638
is made out of dark matter and dark energy.

498
00:17:53.638 --> 00:17:56.638
Dark matter makes up 23% of the universe,

499
00:17:56.638 --> 00:18:00.298
dark energy makes up 73% of the universe.

500
00:18:00.298 --> 00:18:02.578
The stars make up 4% of the universe,

501
00:18:02.578 --> 00:18:05.258
and what about us, the higher elements?

502
00:18:05.258 --> 00:18:09.708
We make up .03% of the universe.

503
00:18:10.458 --> 00:18:14.538
We are by far the vast minority of the universe.

504
00:18:14.538 --> 00:18:16.478
The universe is not made out of atoms,

505
00:18:16.478 --> 00:18:19.398
and our soap bubble is not slowing down,

506
00:18:19.398 --> 00:18:22.618
it's speeding up, it's careening out of control.

507
00:18:22.618 --> 00:18:24.538
We now know that the universe is undergoing

508
00:18:24.538 --> 00:18:26.259
what is called, decelerate expansion,

509
00:18:26.259 --> 00:18:28.839
it's exponentially expanding,

510
00:18:28.839 --> 00:18:30.079
it's gonna blow out.

511
00:18:30.079 --> 00:18:32.059
We can even see the end of the universe,

512
00:18:32.059 --> 00:18:33.939
and I'll talk about how the universe

513
00:18:33.939 --> 00:18:35.819
will eventually die.

514
00:18:35.819 --> 00:18:37.639
As I quote now from the great

515
00:18:37.639 --> 00:18:39.199
philosopher Woody Allen.

516
00:18:39.199 --> 00:18:43.229
Woody Allen once said, eternity is an awful long time,

517
00:18:43.239 --> 00:18:44.731
especially toward the end.

518
00:18:44.731 --> 00:18:46.111
(interviewer giggles)

519
00:18:46.111 --> 00:18:48.111
Well, toward the end it's not gonna be pretty,

520
00:18:48.111 --> 00:18:50.402
the universe will freeze over in a big freeze.

521
00:18:50.972 --> 00:18:52.593
The last component of that picture

522
00:18:52.593 --> 00:18:54.313
of cosmology is also wrong.

523
00:18:54.313 --> 00:18:56.533
It's not just one soap bubble,

524
00:18:56.533 --> 00:18:57.813
we know believe there are other

525
00:18:57.813 --> 00:18:59.253
soap bubbles out there.

526
00:18:59.253 --> 00:19:01.554
<v Voicover>Soap bubbles that we per chance can't see</v>

527
00:19:01.554 --> 00:19:04.554
because it's not part of the same .03%

528
00:19:04.554 --> 00:19:05.714
of what we are, right?

529
00:19:05.714 --> 00:19:07.894
<v ->Well, our soap bubble, we're stuck to</v>

530
00:19:07.894 --> 00:19:10.135
our soap bubble like flies on flypaper.

531
00:19:10.135 --> 00:19:11.695
We cannot leave our soap bubble,

532
00:19:11.695 --> 00:19:13.815
gravity can go between soap bubbles,

533
00:19:13.815 --> 00:19:15.255
but we're stuck on our soap bubble.

534
00:19:15.255 --> 00:19:17.595
But we think that there are other soap bubbles.

535
00:19:17.595 --> 00:19:18.955
Now they would be invisible,

536
00:19:18.955 --> 00:19:20.535
because light only moves,

537
00:19:20.535 --> 00:19:22.635
light is also trapped like flypaper,

538
00:19:22.635 --> 00:19:24.335
flies on flypaper,

539
00:19:24.335 --> 00:19:27.035
light only goes on the surface of the soap bubble.

540
00:19:27.035 --> 00:19:29.335
So if there's another soap bubble right above you,

541
00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:30.655
you'd never know it.

542
00:19:30.655 --> 00:19:32.295
Now where have you seen that before?

543
00:19:32.295 --> 00:19:36.275
That's in the famous novel, The Invisible Man.

544
00:19:36.275 --> 00:19:38.935
In The Invisible Man, H.G Wells gives you

545
00:19:38.935 --> 00:19:40.755
a reason for being invisible.

546
00:19:40.755 --> 00:19:42.094
H says it's flatly,

547
00:19:42.094 --> 00:19:45.709
the fourth dimension, hyperspace.

548
00:19:45.709 --> 00:19:49.069
H.G Wells says, that we live on a plane,

549
00:19:49.069 --> 00:19:51.569
we spend all our time thinking that

550
00:19:51.569 --> 00:19:53.609
our plane is everything there is,

551
00:19:53.609 --> 00:19:56.468
but just above us, there could be another plane.

552
00:19:56.468 --> 00:19:58.069
The invisible man is invisible

553
00:19:58.069 --> 00:20:01.299
because light passes right beneath him, okay?

554
00:20:01.649 --> 00:20:03.949
Now when I was growing up in San Francisco,

555
00:20:03.949 --> 00:20:07.369
I grew up visiting the Japanese tea garden.

556
00:20:07.369 --> 00:20:10.309
My mother would spend hours with me

557
00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:11.749
in the Japanese tea garden,

558
00:20:11.749 --> 00:20:12.813
and I would look at the carp swimming

559
00:20:12.813 --> 00:20:14.473
just beneath the lily pads.

560
00:20:14.473 --> 00:20:17.353
And I would spend hours looking at them,

561
00:20:17.353 --> 00:20:19.833
I would put my nose right up to the fish,

562
00:20:19.833 --> 00:20:21.383
and it couldn't see me.

563
00:20:21.653 --> 00:20:23.213
That their eyes are point to the side,

564
00:20:23.213 --> 00:20:27.402
their universe was a two-dimensional universe.

565
00:20:27.792 --> 00:20:28.712
And then I imagined,

566
00:20:28.712 --> 00:20:30.663
what would it be like to be a fish?

567
00:20:31.193 --> 00:20:33.733
And I said to myself, what a fantastic world,

568
00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:35.573
I can move forward, backward,

569
00:20:35.573 --> 00:20:36.808
left and right,

570
00:20:36.808 --> 00:20:41.098
but the concept of up, up made no sense.

571
00:20:41.868 --> 00:20:43.308
There is no world of up,

572
00:20:43.308 --> 00:20:45.369
your eyes point to the side,

573
00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:47.949
the lily pads show you the end

574
00:20:47.949 --> 00:20:49.148
of the universe.

575
00:20:49.148 --> 00:20:50.999
There is no world of up.

576
00:20:50.999 --> 00:20:53.648
And so then I imagined a fish who was a scientist,

577
00:20:53.648 --> 00:20:54.588
a scientist fish.

578
00:20:54.588 --> 00:20:56.984
<v Voiceover>You must have been a trippy lone kid.</v>

579
00:20:56.984 --> 00:21:00.525
<v ->A little scientist kid swimming in a pond,</v>

580
00:21:00.525 --> 00:21:03.767
and the scientist would say, bah humbug,

581
00:21:03.767 --> 00:21:05.946
there's no world of up,

582
00:21:05.946 --> 00:21:07.637
there's only the pond.

583
00:21:07.826 --> 00:21:10.426
What you see, is what there is,

584
00:21:10.426 --> 00:21:13.286
what you can measure, is what there is,

585
00:21:13.286 --> 00:21:16.187
the pond is everything, the pond is all,

586
00:21:16.187 --> 00:21:18.307
there's nothing as the world of up.

587
00:21:18.307 --> 00:21:19.827
And so then one day I imagined

588
00:21:19.827 --> 00:21:21.767
reaching down and grabbing one of the fish,

589
00:21:21.767 --> 00:21:23.296
the scientist fish.

590
00:21:23.646 --> 00:21:27.047
Lifting the scientist fish up into the world of up,

591
00:21:27.047 --> 00:21:28.326
what would he see?

592
00:21:28.326 --> 00:21:32.276
He would see beings moving without fins,

593
00:21:32.747 --> 00:21:34.256
a new law of physics.

594
00:21:34.486 --> 00:21:37.126
Beings breathing without water,

595
00:21:37.126 --> 00:21:38.956
a new law of biology.

596
00:21:39.746 --> 00:21:42.746
And then I would put the fish back in the pond,

597
00:21:42.746 --> 00:21:45.247
and what a story he would tell his friends.

598
00:21:45.247 --> 00:21:48.387
He disappeared from their universe,

599
00:21:48.387 --> 00:21:50.777
and wound up in a world of up.

600
00:21:51.227 --> 00:21:53.007
Now today we physicists believe that

601
00:21:53.007 --> 00:21:55.057
we are the fish.

602
00:21:56.286 --> 00:21:59.426
We spend all our time saying, bah humbug,

603
00:21:59.426 --> 00:22:01.166
there's only the world that you could

604
00:22:01.166 --> 00:22:02.917
see and measure.

605
00:22:03.027 --> 00:22:06.287
There is forward-backward, left-right, up-down,

606
00:22:06.287 --> 00:22:08.666
and that's all there is,

607
00:22:08.666 --> 00:22:11.286
the universe is what we can measure.

608
00:22:11.286 --> 00:22:14.696
Well our textbooks are now having to be rewritten.

609
00:22:15.226 --> 00:22:17.926
The WMAP satellite currently orbiting the earth,

610
00:22:17.926 --> 00:22:20.207
its data is consistent with what

611
00:22:20.207 --> 00:22:21.886
is called inflation.

612
00:22:21.886 --> 00:22:24.366
Inflation was proposed by a good friend of mine,

613
00:22:24.366 --> 00:22:25.786
Alan Guth at MIT.

614
00:22:25.786 --> 00:22:27.508
He mentioned may win the Nobel prize

615
00:22:27.508 --> 00:22:28.728
for this theory.

616
00:22:28.728 --> 00:22:31.888
Inflation says that the universe expanded

617
00:22:31.888 --> 00:22:34.188
in a hyper-charge big bang,

618
00:22:34.188 --> 00:22:37.958
but it can it happen again, and again, and again.

619
00:22:38.528 --> 00:22:41.568
And the soap bubble can fission in half

620
00:22:41.568 --> 00:22:45.658
and bud, and sprout a baby soap bubble.

621
00:22:46.448 --> 00:22:48.768
Universes can have babies,

622
00:22:48.768 --> 00:22:52.028
Stephen Hawking calls them baby universes.

623
00:22:52.028 --> 00:22:54.308
And we believe that our universe

624
00:22:54.308 --> 00:22:57.388
may have come from a parent universe,

625
00:22:57.388 --> 00:22:59.288
and perhaps our universe also buds

626
00:22:59.288 --> 00:23:00.898
other universes.

627
00:23:01.148 --> 00:23:03.048
Now what about the mathematics,

628
00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:04.268
what about the tests?

629
00:23:04.268 --> 00:23:07.268
Well, as I said, inflation fits all the data,

630
00:23:07.268 --> 00:23:08.449
it doesn't mean it is right,

631
00:23:08.449 --> 00:23:09.889
but it fits all the data.

632
00:23:09.889 --> 00:23:12.008
And inflation is based on the idea,

633
00:23:12.008 --> 00:23:14.728
that it can happen again, and again, and again.

634
00:23:14.728 --> 00:23:16.928
But what about the theory of Inflation?

635
00:23:16.928 --> 00:23:19.188
Well that's where what I do for a living

636
00:23:19.188 --> 00:23:20.748
comes into the picture.

637
00:23:20.748 --> 00:23:22.068
What I work kind of for a living

638
00:23:22.068 --> 00:23:23.908
is something called String Theory.

639
00:23:23.908 --> 00:23:25.968
I'm one of the pioneers in the subject,

640
00:23:25.968 --> 00:23:28.449
I'm the co-founder of String Field Theory,

641
00:23:28.449 --> 00:23:31.128
which is one of the main branches of String Theory.

642
00:23:31.128 --> 00:23:33.548
Now String Theory says that

643
00:23:33.548 --> 00:23:35.998
it is the theory of everything.

644
00:23:36.468 --> 00:23:38.628
Einstein spent the last 30 years of his life

645
00:23:38.628 --> 00:23:41.548
chasing after an equation perhaps

646
00:23:41.548 --> 00:23:43.518
no more than one inch long,

647
00:23:44.048 --> 00:23:47.539
that would allow him to read the mind of God.

648
00:23:48.169 --> 00:23:49.869
That was the ultimate goal,

649
00:23:49.869 --> 00:23:51.908
the holy grail of physics.

650
00:23:51.908 --> 00:23:53.788
An equation one inch long,

651
00:23:53.788 --> 00:23:55.728
just like E equals MC squared.

652
00:23:55.728 --> 00:23:58.648
E equals MC squared unlock the secret of the stars,

653
00:23:58.648 --> 00:24:01.468
that's why the stars twinkle.

654
00:24:01.468 --> 00:24:03.268
That's why our sun burns.

655
00:24:03.268 --> 00:24:05.268
That's why we have energy on the earth.

656
00:24:05.268 --> 00:24:08.188
Everything on the earth, all energy on the earth,

657
00:24:08.188 --> 00:24:11.309
ultimately comes from E equals MC squared.

658
00:24:11.309 --> 00:24:12.870
<v Voiceover>Well that's why one of your book titles</v>

659
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.891
would indicate, it's time to go beyond Einstein?

660
00:24:15.891 --> 00:24:16.850
<v ->That's right.</v>

661
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:18.450
When we go beyond Einstein now,

662
00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:21.130
we now believe that string theory is

663
00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:22.890
perhaps the theory of everything.

664
00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:24.610
When we smash atoms,

665
00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:26.510
we find more particles,

666
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.310
lots and lots of particles.

667
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:30.630
So why should nature be so malicious

668
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:33.410
as to give us thousands of sub-atomic particles?

669
00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:35.651
In fact the situation was so bad that

670
00:24:35.651 --> 00:24:37.110
J. Robert Oppenheimer,

671
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:40.270
the father of the atomic bomb, once said,

672
00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.490
that the Nobel prize in physics,

673
00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:44.770
should go to the physicist who does not

674
00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:47.210
discover a new particle this year.

675
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:48.550
(interviewer chuckles)

676
00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:51.020
We're drowning in particles.

677
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:52.890
When I got my PhD at Berkeley,

678
00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:54.230
I had to memorize all the names

679
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:56.270
of these goddamn sub-atomic particles.

680
00:24:56.931 --> 00:24:58.753
Kappa mesons, lambda particle,

681
00:24:58.753 --> 00:25:02.405
pi mesons, tao mesons, hadrons, leptons.

682
00:25:02.775 --> 00:25:05.875
I couldn't get my PhD unless I a bosons and hadrons.

683
00:25:05.875 --> 00:25:07.315
I couldn't get my PhD unless I memorized

684
00:25:07.315 --> 00:25:09.315
all the names of all these particles.

685
00:25:09.315 --> 00:25:12.795
I hope that in the future, to get your PhD,

686
00:25:12.795 --> 00:25:16.545
a young graduate student would simply say, string.

687
00:25:17.835 --> 00:25:21.205
We think that a vibrating string has nodes.

688
00:25:21.594 --> 00:25:24.444
Each node corresponds to a sub-atomic particle.

689
00:25:24.894 --> 00:25:26.074
If you could get a microscope

690
00:25:26.074 --> 00:25:28.566
and see into the electron, you would see a rubber band.

691
00:25:29.037 --> 00:25:30.337
A rubber band

692
00:25:30.337 --> 00:25:31.737
And you kick the rubber band,

693
00:25:31.737 --> 00:25:34.659
and it vibrates in a different node, becomes neutrino.

694
00:25:34.659 --> 00:25:37.299
You twang it and it becomes a quark,

695
00:25:37.299 --> 00:25:39.278
you twang it, it becomes a lepton,

696
00:25:39.278 --> 00:25:41.018
you twang it, it becomes a boson.

697
00:25:41.688 --> 00:25:42.979
It does a little string.

698
00:25:42.979 --> 00:25:43.759
<v Voiceover>String.</v>

699
00:25:43.759 --> 00:25:45.380
<v ->So what are we?</v>

700
00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.819
The sub-atomic particles are the

701
00:25:46.819 --> 00:25:48.879
nodes on vibrating strings.

702
00:25:48.879 --> 00:25:50.059
What is physics?

703
00:25:50.059 --> 00:25:52.880
Physics is nothing but the laws of harmony,

704
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.340
you can write on strings.

705
00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.200
Well, then what is chemistry?

706
00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.000
Chemistry is nothing but the melodies

707
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.060
you can play on vibrating strings.

708
00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.559
Well, what is the universe?

709
00:26:02.559 --> 00:26:05.139
The universe is a symphony of strings.

710
00:26:05.139 --> 00:26:08.179
And therefore what is the mind of God?

711
00:26:08.179 --> 00:26:11.119
The mind of God in this picture,

712
00:26:11.119 --> 00:26:15.619
is cosmic music resonating through 10,

713
00:26:15.619 --> 00:26:18.299
maybe 11 dimensional hyperspace.

714
00:26:18.299 --> 00:26:21.579
These strings are not ordinary strings,

715
00:26:21.579 --> 00:26:24.899
these strings force physical reality

716
00:26:24.899 --> 00:26:26.619
to be 11 dimensional.

717
00:26:26.619 --> 00:26:27.580
<v Voiceover>What is the implication,</v>

718
00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.301
if we're not just third dimensional?

719
00:26:29.301 --> 00:26:31.601
We've already heard from the invisible man scenario

720
00:26:31.601 --> 00:26:33.601
that we can recognize a fourth dimension.

721
00:26:33.601 --> 00:26:35.461
What does this mean to us?

722
00:26:35.461 --> 00:26:37.121
<v ->This means that our universe</v>

723
00:26:37.121 --> 00:26:39.221
is probably a soap bubble,

724
00:26:39.221 --> 00:26:40.901
a three dimensional soap bubble,

725
00:26:40.901 --> 00:26:44.561
floating in 11 dimensional hyperspace.

726
00:26:44.561 --> 00:26:48.141
That if we were to leave our universe

727
00:26:48.141 --> 00:26:49.581
to go to another universe,

728
00:26:49.581 --> 00:26:51.421
we would have to take a detour

729
00:26:51.421 --> 00:26:53.421
through the 11th dimension.

730
00:26:53.421 --> 00:26:56.382
Now I think that at one point when the universe dies,

731
00:26:56.382 --> 00:26:58.992
this maybe our only salvation.

732
00:26:59.482 --> 00:27:00.922
People ask me the question,

733
00:27:00.922 --> 00:27:04.122
well your unified field theory, the theory of everything.

734
00:27:04.122 --> 00:27:06.453
Is it gonna give me a better color TV?

735
00:27:06.722 --> 00:27:08.613
Will I get better cable reception?

736
00:27:08.863 --> 00:27:11.887
And what is in there for numero uno, okay?

737
00:27:11.887 --> 00:27:13.327
Well I tell them that,

738
00:27:13.327 --> 00:27:14.987
parts of the unified field theory

739
00:27:14.987 --> 00:27:16.997
do give you better color television.

740
00:27:17.107 --> 00:27:19.547
I mean, after all, where does color television come from?

741
00:27:19.547 --> 00:27:21.827
It comes from the unified field theory.

742
00:27:21.827 --> 00:27:23.307
Where does better, you know,

743
00:27:23.307 --> 00:27:24.827
TV reception come from?

744
00:27:24.827 --> 00:27:26.267
From the unified field theory.

745
00:27:26.267 --> 00:27:28.607
But the ultimate use of the unified field theory

746
00:27:28.607 --> 00:27:30.567
is to one day leave our universe.

747
00:27:30.567 --> 00:27:34.518
You see, when a black hole forms, it's a hole,

748
00:27:35.027 --> 00:27:37.088
and everything falls into it,

749
00:27:37.088 --> 00:27:39.088
it's the ultimate roach motel.

750
00:27:39.088 --> 00:27:41.458
Stars fall in, they never fall out.

751
00:27:41.768 --> 00:27:44.767
But even kids tell, ask their father, they say,

752
00:27:44.767 --> 00:27:47.387
daddy daddy, if everything falls into a black hole,

753
00:27:47.387 --> 00:27:49.117
where does it go?

754
00:27:49.727 --> 00:27:51.247
Well there's one theory that says

755
00:27:51.247 --> 00:27:54.028
that where it goes is to a white hole,

756
00:27:54.028 --> 00:27:56.998
at the other end of a black hole.

757
00:27:57.608 --> 00:27:59.828
So think of this soap bubble,

758
00:27:59.828 --> 00:28:03.028
sprouting a baby soap bubble, that's a black hole.

759
00:28:03.028 --> 00:28:05.228
Matter falls into the black hole

760
00:28:05.228 --> 00:28:08.559
and sprouts out the other end to create a white hole.

761
00:28:09.111 --> 00:28:12.281
Now our universe is probably a white hole.

762
00:28:12.892 --> 00:28:15.222
How would you know a white hole if you looked at it?

763
00:28:15.532 --> 00:28:17.572
First of all it will be expanding,

764
00:28:17.572 --> 00:28:19.292
things would be rushing out.

765
00:28:19.292 --> 00:28:22.013
And it'll be very cool as it cooled,

766
00:28:22.013 --> 00:28:24.384
and by golly, doesn't it look like our universe.

767
00:28:24.574 --> 00:28:26.683
Our universe is probably a white hole.

768
00:28:26.913 --> 00:28:28.193
Now in six years time,

769
00:28:28.193 --> 00:28:30.213
we may be able to prove this theory.

770
00:28:30.223 --> 00:28:34.284
In six years time, NASA is gonna launch LISA into orbit.

771
00:28:34.734 --> 00:28:37.884
Laser Interferometry Space Antenna.

772
00:28:38.014 --> 00:28:39.834
It's the most advanced satellite system

773
00:28:39.834 --> 00:28:42.204
ever conceived of by the human mind.

774
00:28:42.594 --> 00:28:45.054
Three satellites orbiting the sun,

775
00:28:45.054 --> 00:28:49.904
connected by laser beams 3 million miles across,

776
00:28:50.974 --> 00:28:52.964
dwarfing the planet earth.

777
00:28:53.195 --> 00:28:54.495
Think about this,

778
00:28:54.495 --> 00:28:56.534
the satellite system, a triangle,

779
00:28:56.534 --> 00:28:57.734
orbiting the sun,

780
00:28:57.734 --> 00:28:59.834
much much bigger than the planet earth.

781
00:28:59.834 --> 00:29:00.558
You could put the planet earth

782
00:29:00.558 --> 00:29:02.737
as a dot inside this triangle.

783
00:29:02.737 --> 00:29:04.957
The shock wave from the big bang

784
00:29:04.957 --> 00:29:07.567
is still reverberating on our soap bubble.

785
00:29:08.017 --> 00:29:11.118
It'lll detect gravity waves from the instant of creation.

786
00:29:11.118 --> 00:29:15.036
We're gonna get baby pictures of the infant universe.

787
00:29:15.586 --> 00:29:18.176
A family album, baby pictures.

788
00:29:18.326 --> 00:29:20.106
This satellite is so accurate,

789
00:29:20.106 --> 00:29:23.486
that it should be able to see the umbilical cord.

790
00:29:23.486 --> 00:29:25.746
The umbilical cord perhaps connecting

791
00:29:25.746 --> 00:29:29.617
our baby universe, to perhaps a parent universe.

792
00:29:31.187 --> 00:29:33.050
<v Voiceover>What did, we're at the science</v>

793
00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:35.030
and consciousness conference?

794
00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:36.871
What is the implication of this,

795
00:29:36.871 --> 00:29:39.272
in terms of our own awakening

796
00:29:39.272 --> 00:29:43.641
into our own individual expanded consciousness?

797
00:29:44.071 --> 00:29:46.761
Saying individual, I mean interconnectedness as well,

798
00:29:46.761 --> 00:29:48.071
but what does this mean to us?

799
00:29:48.071 --> 00:29:49.491
<v ->Several things.</v>

800
00:29:49.491 --> 00:29:50.831
First of all as I mentioned,

801
00:29:50.831 --> 00:29:52.651
only a type three civilization

802
00:29:52.651 --> 00:29:57.041
could fully utilize the power of this theory.

803
00:29:57.751 --> 00:30:01.142
We're talking about the ability to bend time into a pretzel.

804
00:30:01.951 --> 00:30:04.291
Rip the fabric of space time,

805
00:30:04.291 --> 00:30:06.681
leap into the 11th dimension.

806
00:30:06.971 --> 00:30:09.011
This is the power of a god,

807
00:30:09.011 --> 00:30:11.891
that's the power of a Planck energy.

808
00:30:11.891 --> 00:30:13.591
The Planck energy is the enegy

809
00:30:13.591 --> 00:30:15.411
of a type three civilization.

810
00:30:15.411 --> 00:30:18.712
A type three civilization would be able to open gateways,

811
00:30:18.712 --> 00:30:21.191
open baby universes,

812
00:30:21.191 --> 00:30:23.552
create a baby universe in a laboratory.

813
00:30:23.552 --> 00:30:25.852
They would have the power of a god.

814
00:30:25.852 --> 00:30:30.101
That's what this whole sequence is building up to.

815
00:30:30.511 --> 00:30:32.391
So when I talked about type zero,

816
00:30:32.391 --> 00:30:35.271
type one, type two, type three,

817
00:30:35.271 --> 00:30:37.551
if we don't blow ourselves up

818
00:30:37.551 --> 00:30:39.371
in this whole process of evolving

819
00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:41.371
from a type zero civilization,

820
00:30:41.371 --> 00:30:44.211
eventually we'll become masters of space and time.

821
00:30:44.211 --> 00:30:45.962
That's one aspect.

822
00:30:46.512 --> 00:30:49.491
The other aspect is more practical,

823
00:30:49.491 --> 00:30:52.781
that is where do we fit into the larger scheme of things.

824
00:30:53.431 --> 00:30:55.862
This theory, string theory is a quantum theory.

825
00:30:56.461 --> 00:30:58.471
In fact, it is the ultimate quantum theory,

826
00:30:58.471 --> 00:31:01.963
and all quantum theories say that everything vibrates,

827
00:31:02.713 --> 00:31:04.823
everything is made out of a wave.

828
00:31:05.313 --> 00:31:06.293
And because of that,

829
00:31:06.293 --> 00:31:08.292
these waves inter-tangle with each other.

830
00:31:08.292 --> 00:31:10.342
This is called entanglement.

831
00:31:10.572 --> 00:31:14.573
An entanglement means that our waves entangle with waves

832
00:31:14.573 --> 00:31:16.923
of the other side of the galaxy.

833
00:31:17.373 --> 00:31:20.672
Instantly in fact, we are all connected

834
00:31:20.672 --> 00:31:22.782
via this invisible web.

835
00:31:23.692 --> 00:31:25.993
Einstein at first didn't like this picture,

836
00:31:25.993 --> 00:31:29.453
cause if you were to move in one part of the universe,

837
00:31:30.303 --> 00:31:33.863
the other part of the universe will also respond to you,

838
00:31:33.863 --> 00:31:36.473
faster than the speed of light.

839
00:31:37.123 --> 00:31:38.464
Einstein at first didn't like it,

840
00:31:38.464 --> 00:31:40.284
but it's been shown in the laboratory.

841
00:31:40.284 --> 00:31:42.303
This is the famous EPR Experiment.

842
00:31:42.303 --> 00:31:44.124
It's been shown many times now,

843
00:31:44.124 --> 00:31:48.644
that entanglement does in fact make possible vibrations,

844
00:31:49.594 --> 00:31:51.894
traveling faster than the speed of light.

845
00:31:52.264 --> 00:31:53.743
Now of course, the information

846
00:31:53.743 --> 00:31:55.524
traveling faster than the speed of light

847
00:31:55.524 --> 00:31:56.924
is random information.

848
00:31:56.924 --> 00:31:58.864
You cannot send Morse code this way,

849
00:31:58.864 --> 00:32:02.424
you cannot send tomorrow's stock exchange this way.

850
00:32:02.424 --> 00:32:05.214
But what it does mean is that we're all entangled.

851
00:32:05.884 --> 00:32:07.544
Our wave functions all entangled

852
00:32:07.544 --> 00:32:08.933
with other wave functions.

853
00:32:09.323 --> 00:32:11.024
And I should also point out in all fairness,

854
00:32:11.024 --> 00:32:14.063
there is one unfinished aspect

855
00:32:14.063 --> 00:32:16.653
of the foundation of the quantum theory.

856
00:32:17.203 --> 00:32:18.403
The quantum theory is the most

857
00:32:18.403 --> 00:32:19.664
successful theory of all time,

858
00:32:19.664 --> 00:32:21.874
even more accurate than Newton's laws of gravity.

859
00:32:22.104 --> 00:32:23.684
It works in the atomic realm,

860
00:32:23.684 --> 00:32:27.525
but it's based on the foundation of sand.

861
00:32:27.525 --> 00:32:29.515
There is the famous cat problem.

862
00:32:30.365 --> 00:32:33.185
The cat problem is the most profound

863
00:32:33.185 --> 00:32:35.715
paradox in the history of the universe.

864
00:32:36.025 --> 00:32:37.405
At the present time,

865
00:32:37.405 --> 00:32:40.275
no one has a solution for the cat problem.

866
00:32:40.765 --> 00:32:42.164
<v Voiceover>What is that problem?</v>

867
00:32:42.164 --> 00:32:44.384
<v ->This is the famous Schrodinger cat problem.</v>

868
00:32:44.384 --> 00:32:46.544
Schrodinger was one of the founders

869
00:32:46.544 --> 00:32:48.004
of the quantum theory,

870
00:32:48.004 --> 00:32:51.115
a theory that has been tested to one part in 10 billion.

871
00:32:51.465 --> 00:32:54.684
You can predict the power, the behavior of atoms

872
00:32:54.684 --> 00:32:57.244
to incredible accuracy, that's why we have transistors,

873
00:32:57.244 --> 00:32:58.464
that's why we have the internet,

874
00:32:58.464 --> 00:32:59.904
that's why we have laser beams,

875
00:32:59.904 --> 00:33:01.644
because of the quantum theory.

876
00:33:01.644 --> 00:33:04.745
However, the laser beams, transistors, the internet,

877
00:33:04.745 --> 00:33:08.284
is based of foundation of sand, because Nobel laureates

878
00:33:08.284 --> 00:33:11.234
still argue over the cat problem.

879
00:33:11.644 --> 00:33:14.006
Let's say I put a cat in a box,

880
00:33:14.006 --> 00:33:16.776
and the question, is the cat dead or alive?

881
00:33:17.206 --> 00:33:20.546
Well you don't really know for sure

882
00:33:20.546 --> 00:33:22.176
until you look at the cat.

883
00:33:22.466 --> 00:33:24.446
Let's say the cat is connected to a gun,

884
00:33:24.446 --> 00:33:27.009
and the gun is connected to a Geiger counter,

885
00:33:27.009 --> 00:33:29.450
and the Geiger counter is connected to uranium.

886
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:31.270
Well to describe uranium,

887
00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:33.710
we have to write the wave function of uranium

888
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:35.269
which is disintegrated,

889
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:37.469
and uranium which hasn't disintegrated.

890
00:33:37.469 --> 00:33:40.249
50% chance maybe that it'll disintegrate,

891
00:33:40.249 --> 00:33:42.970
50% chance that it hasn't disintegrated,

892
00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:45.240
that's the quantum theory.

893
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:47.150
You're working on probabilities, right?

894
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:49.009
The atomic bomb is based on this theory.

895
00:33:49.009 --> 00:33:50.490
The atomic bomb wouldn't work,

896
00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:52.350
if the quantum theory were wrong.

897
00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:55.810
But now hook the uranium to a gun,

898
00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:57.960
well is the cat dead or alive?

899
00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:02.309
Well, you have to add the wave function of a dead cat

900
00:34:02.309 --> 00:34:04.009
and add it to the wave function

901
00:34:04.009 --> 00:34:06.389
of a life cat, simultaneously,

902
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:09.319
so the cat is neither dead or alive.

903
00:34:09.509 --> 00:34:10.849
Now you may say to yourself,

904
00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:12.389
well that's stupid.

905
00:34:13.319 --> 00:34:16.339
How can a cat be both dead or alive?

906
00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:19.010
Well the only way to tell is to open the box.

907
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:20.090
<v Voiceover>It's probability.</v>

908
00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:22.030
<v ->And then, the cat then collapses</v>

909
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:24.289
into a dead cat or a live cat.

910
00:34:24.289 --> 00:34:25.550
Well that means that observation

911
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:27.531
determined existence.

912
00:34:27.531 --> 00:34:31.311
So you're now left with a very horrible,

913
00:34:31.311 --> 00:34:34.000
absolutely incredible paradox.

914
00:34:34.191 --> 00:34:37.410
Either the act of observation

915
00:34:37.410 --> 00:34:40.791
determines the existence of a cat,

916
00:34:40.791 --> 00:34:45.560
or the cat is simultaneously dead and alive.

917
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:49.960
Both alternatives are mind blowing,

918
00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:53.710
both alternatives shake philosophy

919
00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.520
to the very core.

920
00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:58.130
Let's take the first alternative,

921
00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.150
observation determines existence,

922
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:02.950
but observation requires consciousness.

923
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:05.490
Therefore consciousness makes an observation,

924
00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:07.350
and then we say the cat is alive.

925
00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:10.830
Well, I determine the fact, the cat is alive.

926
00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:12.322
Well, who determines me?

927
00:35:13.672 --> 00:35:15.532
Somebody has to look at me

928
00:35:15.532 --> 00:35:18.052
to determine that I'm alive, and I'm not dead.

929
00:35:18.052 --> 00:35:20.422
Well who determines him?

930
00:35:20.612 --> 00:35:22.192
Somebody has to look at him,

931
00:35:22.192 --> 00:35:24.112
and this is called Wigner's friend.

932
00:35:24.112 --> 00:35:25.892
Wigner was the winner of the Nobel prize,

933
00:35:25.892 --> 00:35:28.172
he helped to build the atomic bomb,

934
00:35:28.172 --> 00:35:30.653
and this is called Wigner's friend.

935
00:35:30.653 --> 00:35:32.992
I have an infinite sequence of Wigner's friend,

936
00:35:32.992 --> 00:35:35.373
so who is the ultimate Wigner's friend?

937
00:35:35.373 --> 00:35:36.663
God.

938
00:35:37.793 --> 00:35:39.954
So starting with quantum theory,

939
00:35:39.954 --> 00:35:43.174
which is the most objective reductionist

940
00:35:43.174 --> 00:35:44.474
theory of all time,

941
00:35:44.474 --> 00:35:46.304
you go all the way to God.

942
00:35:46.514 --> 00:35:47.934
Now let's say you don't want that,

943
00:35:47.934 --> 00:35:50.474
let's say you don't believe in this Nobel prize winner.

944
00:35:50.474 --> 00:35:53.204
Let's say you believe in the other theory.

945
00:35:54.134 --> 00:35:55.973
The other theory is even worse,

946
00:35:56.633 --> 00:35:58.723
the other theory is many worlds.

947
00:35:59.293 --> 00:36:02.683
Most Nobel laureates now are leading towards the second.

948
00:36:03.693 --> 00:36:05.913
Steve Weinberg, winner of the Nobel prize,

949
00:36:05.913 --> 00:36:07.585
has said the following.

950
00:36:07.835 --> 00:36:10.915
Imagine you're in a room and many radio frequencies

951
00:36:10.915 --> 00:36:12.424
are in the same room.

952
00:36:12.934 --> 00:36:15.255
Your radio is tuned into one frequency,

953
00:36:15.255 --> 00:36:16.755
but you're very comfortable

954
00:36:16.755 --> 00:36:19.625
being in a room with many frequencies, right?

955
00:36:20.015 --> 00:36:21.415
But you're tuned into one.

956
00:36:21.415 --> 00:36:23.885
Well these frequencies are now wave functions.

957
00:36:24.255 --> 00:36:28.686
In this room, there is the wave function of dinosaurs.

958
00:36:29.696 --> 00:36:33.505
In this room, because they never died 65 million years ago,

959
00:36:33.595 --> 00:36:36.755
cause a cosmic event prevented extinction of the dinosaurs.

960
00:36:36.755 --> 00:36:39.795
In this room, there's the wave function of aliens.

961
00:36:39.795 --> 00:36:41.095
Cause perhaps the aliens decide

962
00:36:41.095 --> 00:36:43.635
to colonize the earth millions of years ago.

963
00:36:43.635 --> 00:36:46.215
In this room, there's the wave function

964
00:36:46.215 --> 00:36:47.915
of Alexander the Great,

965
00:36:47.915 --> 00:36:49.856
perhaps he came all the way to the Americas

966
00:36:49.856 --> 00:36:54.106
instead of being, just conquering most of the old world.

967
00:36:55.055 --> 00:36:57.915
Think about it, your mind goes crazy,

968
00:36:57.915 --> 00:36:59.585
this is the multiverse.

969
00:36:59.835 --> 00:37:01.705
So welcome to the multiverse.

970
00:37:02.095 --> 00:37:03.315
We now believe that perhaps

971
00:37:03.315 --> 00:37:06.255
there are infinite number of universes out there.

972
00:37:06.255 --> 00:37:08.495
Most of them probably dead universes,

973
00:37:08.495 --> 00:37:10.435
but some of them may be separate

974
00:37:10.435 --> 00:37:13.545
from our universe by a single quantum event.

975
00:37:13.875 --> 00:37:16.305
The smallest quantum event is a cosmic ray.

976
00:37:16.915 --> 00:37:19.885
Let's say a cosmic ray goes through Hitler's mother.

977
00:37:20.355 --> 00:37:22.695
Hitler's mother has a miscarriage,

978
00:37:22.695 --> 00:37:24.715
Hitler is never born.

979
00:37:24.715 --> 00:37:26.995
All of a sudden perhaps 40 50 million people

980
00:37:26.995 --> 00:37:29.965
didn't have to die and they're living with us today.

981
00:37:30.316 --> 00:37:32.075
Or perhaps a cosmic ray went through

982
00:37:32.075 --> 00:37:33.875
Roosevelt's mother,

983
00:37:33.875 --> 00:37:37.095
and Roosevelt never roused the American people

984
00:37:37.095 --> 00:37:40.675
to oppose the forces of the Axes,

985
00:37:40.675 --> 00:37:42.415
and I'm speaking German today,

986
00:37:42.415 --> 00:37:45.445
and there's a swastika behind me right now.

987
00:37:45.595 --> 00:37:48.135
I mean one quantum event,

988
00:37:48.135 --> 00:37:51.085
separates us from these parallel worlds.

989
00:37:51.795 --> 00:37:53.395
Now some people ask me the question,

990
00:37:53.395 --> 00:37:56.215
well professor, if Nobel laureates are even

991
00:37:56.215 --> 00:37:59.716
arguing about this, then the question is,

992
00:37:59.716 --> 00:38:03.066
is Elvis Presley still alive in one of these universes?

993
00:38:03.897 --> 00:38:05.278
<v Voiceover>Many would say yes.</v>

994
00:38:05.278 --> 00:38:06.838
<v ->Well believe it or not,</v>

995
00:38:06.838 --> 00:38:08.638
there are physicists at Oxford University,

996
00:38:08.638 --> 00:38:10.018
David Dodge for example,

997
00:38:10.018 --> 00:38:11.708
who would say yes.

998
00:38:12.318 --> 00:38:15.527
There's a universe where the king is still alive.

999
00:38:16.177 --> 00:38:19.138
<v ->Wow, kids, we've got some things to think about,</v>

1000
00:38:19.138 --> 00:38:22.398
and we're blown away if we think

1001
00:38:22.398 --> 00:38:26.199
there is such a phenomenon as our dead aunt Lily talking

1002
00:38:26.199 --> 00:38:29.659
through a medium to us, and you're talking about

1003
00:38:29.659 --> 00:38:31.700
many different potential realities.

1004
00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.759
<v ->Nobel laureates argue about this question.</v>

1005
00:38:33.759 --> 00:38:35.319
This is one of the greatest unresolved

1006
00:38:35.319 --> 00:38:37.369
questions in all of physics.

1007
00:38:37.639 --> 00:38:40.439
Physics is fantastic, it's incredibly accurate,

1008
00:38:40.439 --> 00:38:42.409
but is based on the cat.

1009
00:38:42.759 --> 00:38:43.859
And at the present time

1010
00:38:43.859 --> 00:38:46.189
there's no consensus on the cat problem.

1011
00:38:46.379 --> 00:38:48.039
There are hundreds of physics conferences,

1012
00:38:48.039 --> 00:38:49.499
my friends attend these conferences.

1013
00:38:49.499 --> 00:38:50.799
Physicists yell at each other,

1014
00:38:50.799 --> 00:38:51.939
they scream at each other,

1015
00:38:51.939 --> 00:38:55.049
cause what is at stake, is reality itself.

1016
00:38:55.899 --> 00:38:59.309
The nature of existence, that is what is at stake.

1017
00:39:00.679 --> 00:39:02.679
<v  Voiceover>Michio thank you so much for taking time.</v>

1018
00:39:02.679 --> 00:39:03.969
<v ->My pleasure.</v>

1019
00:39:05.099 --> 00:39:07.100
<v ->His newest book Parallel Worlds,</v>

1020
00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.580
focuses on the newest multiverse theories.

1021
00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:11.180
I also loved his book, Visions,

1022
00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:13.600
which extrapolates what our lives will look like,

1023
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.480
50, 100, 1,000, and even more years

1024
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.820
into the future.

1025
00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:18.761
Like this interview,

1026
00:39:18.761 --> 00:39:20.991
his writing is wonderfully entertaining.

1027
00:39:21.121 --> 00:39:22.481
You can look at a complete selection

1028
00:39:22.481 --> 00:39:23.682
of his work on his website,

1029
00:39:23.682 --> 00:39:25.872
listed beside his name on the menu.

1030
00:39:26.062 --> 00:39:28.055
Until next time, thanks for watching.

1031
00:39:28.055 --> 00:39:32.985
(mysterious music)
