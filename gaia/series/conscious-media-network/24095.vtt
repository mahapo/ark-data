00:00:00.528 --> 00:00:03.454
<v ->The gap between those who are technologically proficient</v>

2
00:00:03.454 --> 00:00:05.892
and those who aren't will never be more apparent than

3
00:00:05.892 --> 00:00:07.401
at this point in time.

4
00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:09.363
But what does our technological future hold

5
00:00:09.363 --> 00:00:10.571
for all of us?

6
00:00:10.571 --> 00:00:14.007
We spoke with Ian Wegge, a futurist who assists corporations

7
00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:16.875
to assess what kinds of changes they need to prepare for

8
00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:20.242
to keep pace with the rapid changes in technology.

9
00:00:20.242 --> 00:00:22.250
From retail industries to the way we interface

10
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.153
with our automobiles, Ian has a fascinating take

11
00:00:25.153 --> 00:00:27.632
on what our futures may look like.

12
00:00:36.263 --> 00:00:37.889
<v Voiceover>You are known as a futurist.</v>

13
00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:40.524
You refer to yourself as a futurist.

14
00:00:40.524 --> 00:00:43.253
Why don't we begin where we are right now,

15
00:00:43.253 --> 00:00:45.737
which is the world seems to be spinning out of control,

16
00:00:45.737 --> 00:00:47.397
the rate of change in technology

17
00:00:47.397 --> 00:00:49.139
is absolutely mind-boggling.

18
00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:50.892
Tell us where we are.

19
00:00:50.892 --> 00:00:52.076
<v ->Well, if we know one thing,</v>

20
00:00:52.076 --> 00:00:52.808
we know that the rate

21
00:00:52.808 --> 00:00:55.749
of change is increasing every single day,

22
00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:57.978
and that lifestyles of my children are

23
00:00:57.978 --> 00:00:59.452
very different to mine.

24
00:00:59.452 --> 00:01:02.088
I think the lifestyles of their children will change

25
00:01:02.088 --> 00:01:04.758
many times throughout the course of their lifetime.

26
00:01:04.758 --> 00:01:06.221
Of course, today we already know

27
00:01:06.221 --> 00:01:08.926
that if a technology works, it's probably obsolete.

28
00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:11.027
Somebody's already working on the next phase,

29
00:01:11.027 --> 00:01:12.757
the next best thing.

30
00:01:12.757 --> 00:01:14.464
When we look at the different technologies

31
00:01:14.464 --> 00:01:16.229
that we brought into our lives,

32
00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.527
we can start to determine what the impacts

33
00:01:18.527 --> 00:01:20.269
of those are likely to be.

34
00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:22.672
And over the next 20, 50, 100 years,

35
00:01:22.672 --> 00:01:24.472
I think the way in which we live our lives

36
00:01:24.472 --> 00:01:26.538
will be dramatically different to the way it was

37
00:01:26.538 --> 00:01:28.013
as we grew up.

38
00:01:28.013 --> 00:01:30.079
Not only that, we have a number of areas

39
00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.682
that we're going to need to look at

40
00:01:31.682 --> 00:01:33.272
in terms of being successful.

41
00:01:33.272 --> 00:01:35.490
If we're an individual, we have to accept

42
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.626
that we may need to have different careers.

43
00:01:37.626 --> 00:01:38.682
There are some careers that I think

44
00:01:38.682 --> 00:01:40.621
we'll always need and others we may have

45
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:43.489
to recognize that will only be good for us

46
00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:44.557
for the period of time in which

47
00:01:44.557 --> 00:01:47.192
that technology is readily useable.

48
00:01:47.192 --> 00:01:49.271
As it becomes obsolete, we'll have to be prepared

49
00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:51.429
to retrain and move on.

50
00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.216
<v Voiceover>So what happens to people who,</v>

51
00:01:53.216 --> 00:01:56.209
at this point in history, say are over the age of 35

52
00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:57.270
and they've gone to college.

53
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.139
They've put in their eight years,

54
00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:00.776
have their graduate degrees

55
00:02:00.776 --> 00:02:04.619
and are pretty much entrenched in a certain industry.

56
00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.836
It appears this industry is going to change.

57
00:02:06.836 --> 00:02:09.089
Give us some examples of ways in which

58
00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:11.086
this is already happening.

59
00:02:11.086 --> 00:02:12.386
Of course, this extends to people

60
00:02:12.386 --> 00:02:15.544
above the age of 35, who might be less flexible,

61
00:02:15.544 --> 00:02:18.063
especially as we approach 50 and over.

62
00:02:18.063 --> 00:02:21.198
<v ->OK, well, I think that if you're a doctor,</v>

63
00:02:21.198 --> 00:02:22.359
you're safe.

64
00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:23.636
We know that we're going

65
00:02:23.636 --> 00:02:25.002
to need health care for a long time.

66
00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:26.740
I think the age of the accountant will be

67
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.004
with us for some time as people manage their money,

68
00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:31.315
but I think we'll automate a number of the functions

69
00:02:31.315 --> 00:02:33.381
that we currently use an accountant for.

70
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:36.075
We will embed our accounting and our taxation

71
00:02:36.075 --> 00:02:39.511
in our everyday lives through the use of a PDA.

72
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:41.775
All our transactions will become noted.

73
00:02:41.775 --> 00:02:44.086
There are other industries that we can already see

74
00:02:44.086 --> 00:02:45.816
might be declining.

75
00:02:45.816 --> 00:02:48.857
We can see that our service industries are going abroad.

76
00:02:48.857 --> 00:02:50.692
Our manufacturing is going abroad.

77
00:02:50.692 --> 00:02:52.561
That's not to say we don't need the engineers

78
00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:54.593
that are expert in manufacturing,

79
00:02:54.593 --> 00:02:57.832
but we may not need them in a specific location.

80
00:02:57.832 --> 00:03:01.036
Today we have the scenarios of a huge amount

81
00:03:01.036 --> 00:03:04.264
of what we call "outsourcing" to India in the IT world,

82
00:03:04.264 --> 00:03:07.039
yet we still think we'll be short of those IT resources.

83
00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:08.745
It's still a good skill to have.

84
00:03:08.745 --> 00:03:11.752
But there are other skill sets which will become redundant.

85
00:03:11.752 --> 00:03:14.655
We've seen this with whole industries and companies.

86
00:03:14.655 --> 00:03:19.655
The photocopying industry outdid the carbon sheets

87
00:03:19.763 --> 00:03:21.923
that we used to buy because we wanted

88
00:03:21.923 --> 00:03:23.664
to receive copies of things.

89
00:03:23.664 --> 00:03:25.928
Kodak have reinvented themselves,

90
00:03:25.928 --> 00:03:27.263
but unfortunately unsuccessfully,

91
00:03:27.263 --> 00:03:28.935
as a digital camera company.

92
00:03:28.935 --> 00:03:31.791
And whole industries have gone by the wayside.

93
00:03:31.791 --> 00:03:33.765
I think if you look over the last 30 years

94
00:03:33.765 --> 00:03:36.040
at the Fortune 500, you'll find

95
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.303
that almost half those companies have disappeared.

96
00:03:39.303 --> 00:03:41.648
And that rate of change will probably accelerate.

97
00:03:41.648 --> 00:03:43.680
You have to be quick to market today

98
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.883
in order to gain traction, in order to gain profitability.

99
00:03:47.883 --> 00:03:49.914
If you're second, there may be a place for you.

100
00:03:49.914 --> 00:03:52.051
If you're third and fourth, it's very difficult

101
00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:53.664
to be a niche player.

102
00:03:53.664 --> 00:03:54.686
And I'm worried.

103
00:03:54.686 --> 00:03:56.892
I'm very concerned that, today,

104
00:03:56.892 --> 00:03:59.156
we have a large number of technologies

105
00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:01.791
that not only are replacing existing industries,

106
00:04:01.791 --> 00:04:03.498
but they're consolidating industries

107
00:04:03.498 --> 00:04:05.263
into one piece of equipment.

108
00:04:05.263 --> 00:04:07.364
And that piece of equipment is the PDA

109
00:04:07.364 --> 00:04:08.804
or the cell phone.

110
00:04:08.804 --> 00:04:10.870
Whereas it was a communications device,

111
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.274
we're now embedding so much more technology

112
00:04:13.274 --> 00:04:14.980
into that device.

113
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.548
If we take the reason for that,

114
00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:19.706
it's quite simply that we've had the digital age.

115
00:04:19.706 --> 00:04:22.852
The ability to reduce into bits and bytes,

116
00:04:22.852 --> 00:04:24.884
everything we write, everything we say,

117
00:04:24.884 --> 00:04:26.555
everything we film,

118
00:04:26.555 --> 00:04:27.844
everything we photograph

119
00:04:27.844 --> 00:04:31.455
is now digitally enabled through bits and bytes.

120
00:04:31.455 --> 00:04:34.392
We've been able to compress into an ever smaller chip

121
00:04:34.392 --> 00:04:36.270
using the Moore's Law principle,

122
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.871
that the processing power will double every year or so,

123
00:04:38.871 --> 00:04:41.174
we've been able to consolidate bits and bytes

124
00:04:41.174 --> 00:04:44.645
to represent video, pictures, text.

125
00:04:44.645 --> 00:04:46.828
That's given us the ability to store and archive

126
00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:49.010
virtually all of the information that we've ever had

127
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.145
in the world, but also to invent new technologies

128
00:04:52.145 --> 00:04:54.513
using the technology.

129
00:04:54.513 --> 00:04:58.287
E.g., geographic positioning systems are now embedded

130
00:04:58.287 --> 00:04:59.692
in your cell phone.

131
00:04:59.692 --> 00:05:00.818
We use it as a diary.

132
00:05:00.818 --> 00:05:03.128
We use it as the personal digital assistant.

133
00:05:03.128 --> 00:05:05.160
A lot of the things that we see on a PC

134
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.319
are now within that PDA.

135
00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:10.303
As we increase the power of that chip,

136
00:05:10.303 --> 00:05:12.172
we'll be able to play video.

137
00:05:12.172 --> 00:05:14.169
We'll be able. maybe, to get video on-demand,

138
00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.840
downloaded while asleep from a remote point.

139
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.535
We can use it as a radio,

140
00:05:18.535 --> 00:05:19.707
a voice recorder.

141
00:05:19.707 --> 00:05:22.377
We'll use it as our MP3 player for music.

142
00:05:22.377 --> 00:05:24.549
We will find other ways to use them,

143
00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:26.882
perhaps we haven't even thought of yet.

144
00:05:26.882 --> 00:05:29.123
But all of those periphery devices

145
00:05:29.123 --> 00:05:31.526
that we have squeezed into one device

146
00:05:31.526 --> 00:05:34.382
will create an alarming change in the economy,

147
00:05:34.382 --> 00:05:35.915
because all the people that were employed

148
00:05:35.915 --> 00:05:38.295
in those whole industries are now faced

149
00:05:38.295 --> 00:05:40.721
with the prospect of having to retrain

150
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:42.358
to do something else.

151
00:05:42.358 --> 00:05:46.863
We know that if you were a CD manufacturer,

152
00:05:46.863 --> 00:05:49.510
you're gonna be replaced by MP3 technology.

153
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.913
If you were processing photographs,

154
00:05:51.913 --> 00:05:53.504
you're probably going to be replaced

155
00:05:53.504 --> 00:05:57.811
by a digital camera and a photographic printer.

156
00:05:57.811 --> 00:06:00.087
All of those technologies, being embedded

157
00:06:00.087 --> 00:06:02.652
into a single device will have the effect

158
00:06:02.652 --> 00:06:06.159
of creating maybe even a recession in the economy,

159
00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:09.224
as we don't have enough consumer demand

160
00:06:09.224 --> 00:06:11.186
for those periphery devices.

161
00:06:11.186 --> 00:06:13.427
As I grew up and started my first home,

162
00:06:13.427 --> 00:06:15.319
I needed a record player.

163
00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:16.968
That became a CD player.

164
00:06:16.968 --> 00:06:19.464
I may have chosen to have a fax machine

165
00:06:19.464 --> 00:06:22.471
and a phone and then, later, an Internet connection.

166
00:06:22.471 --> 00:06:25.571
Lastly, I may have bought a projector

167
00:06:25.571 --> 00:06:27.835
to project my 35 millimeter slides

168
00:06:27.835 --> 00:06:29.379
onto a screen.

169
00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:30.911
I would have bought a screen.

170
00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:32.177
There are a whole number of things

171
00:06:32.177 --> 00:06:33.581
that we would have put in our houses

172
00:06:33.581 --> 00:06:35.381
that our children will grow up

173
00:06:35.381 --> 00:06:37.471
and probably not need to purchase.

174
00:06:37.471 --> 00:06:39.979
Because a single device will have replaced all

175
00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:41.952
of those technologies.

176
00:06:41.952 --> 00:06:44.088
I think that if you're employed as somebody

177
00:06:44.088 --> 00:06:47.130
in those technologies, or developing those technologies

178
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.325
as products, we have to be careful.

179
00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:51.867
Because it's likely that we are going to be forced out

180
00:06:51.867 --> 00:06:54.375
of the market and become a niche player.

181
00:06:54.375 --> 00:06:57.544
There will always be room for an up-market hi-fi,

182
00:06:57.544 --> 00:07:00.110
but there may not always be room for mass-market

183
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.210
of people who need a CD Walkman

184
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.044
when they're embedding it within their cell phone

185
00:07:05.044 --> 00:07:07.053
or their personal digital assistant.

186
00:07:07.053 --> 00:07:09.584
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about a situation</v>

187
00:07:09.584 --> 00:07:11.720
that has actually gone the opposite direction,

188
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.193
an industry that has been revived as a result

189
00:07:14.193 --> 00:07:15.261
of technology.

190
00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:17.189
We're looking at the shipping industry

191
00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:20.799
as a result of the increase in online marketing.

192
00:07:20.799 --> 00:07:24.700
<v ->Eight years ago, when the Internet was becoming pervasive,</v>

193
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.465
and we all understood that E-commerce

194
00:07:26.465 --> 00:07:29.205
and the ability to buy products online was going

195
00:07:29.205 --> 00:07:30.842
to mean that we were going to be shipping

196
00:07:30.842 --> 00:07:33.036
a large number of goods from A to B.

197
00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:34.638
Then we had the Ebay revolution,

198
00:07:34.638 --> 00:07:37.518
where individuals became their own retailer

199
00:07:37.518 --> 00:07:41.314
and were selling things to whoever was interested worldwide

200
00:07:41.314 --> 00:07:42.823
in purchasing them.

201
00:07:42.823 --> 00:07:44.251
You didn't need to be a rocket scientist

202
00:07:44.251 --> 00:07:46.527
at that stage to realize that there was going

203
00:07:46.527 --> 00:07:49.627
to be a lot more items being shipped from A to B.

204
00:07:49.627 --> 00:07:52.332
The traditional postal services did not have a monopoly

205
00:07:52.332 --> 00:07:54.898
on that business and were rather more expensive

206
00:07:54.898 --> 00:07:56.964
often than the courier firms were.

207
00:07:56.964 --> 00:07:59.205
If we take DHL, we look at FedEx.

208
00:07:59.205 --> 00:08:00.703
We look at UPS.

209
00:08:00.703 --> 00:08:02.595
They've all done exceptionally well.

210
00:08:02.595 --> 00:08:04.070
They've grown their businesses.

211
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.844
In terms of net worth to their shareholders,

212
00:08:06.844 --> 00:08:09.735
they've all doubled in value in the last five years.

213
00:08:09.735 --> 00:08:11.918
So, there have been industries that were traditional

214
00:08:11.918 --> 00:08:14.077
that have benefited from this revolution,

215
00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:15.714
just as there have been some industries

216
00:08:15.714 --> 00:08:17.781
that have obviously declined as a result

217
00:08:17.781 --> 00:08:21.554
of the digital revolution and E-commerce.

218
00:08:21.554 --> 00:08:23.888
Today the retail industry will suffer

219
00:08:23.888 --> 00:08:25.397
by the fact that the expertise

220
00:08:25.397 --> 00:08:27.127
that we used to go to

221
00:08:27.127 --> 00:08:29.995
is now available to us, still, at the retail store,

222
00:08:29.995 --> 00:08:31.504
but we can also look it up online

223
00:08:31.504 --> 00:08:33.965
and find out what was the best product

224
00:08:33.965 --> 00:08:35.637
and then find the best price.

225
00:08:35.637 --> 00:08:38.168
It's moving us into a perfect market situation,

226
00:08:38.168 --> 00:08:40.246
where we know all the people that manufacture,

227
00:08:40.246 --> 00:08:42.383
and we can research in our own homes

228
00:08:42.383 --> 00:08:44.681
all of the prices with this technology.

229
00:08:44.681 --> 00:08:46.376
Which makes it difficult for a retailer,

230
00:08:46.376 --> 00:08:48.780
with their increased overheads, to survive.

231
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.347
Of course, we're going through that transition

232
00:08:50.347 --> 00:08:52.727
where some of use are familiar with the technology.

233
00:08:52.727 --> 00:08:54.782
Some of us--

234
00:08:54.782 --> 00:08:57.023
My parents, for instance, are still very much

235
00:08:57.023 --> 00:08:58.555
against the use of that technology

236
00:08:58.555 --> 00:09:00.401
and like the personal touch.

237
00:09:00.401 --> 00:09:01.992
We are growing a generation of children

238
00:09:01.992 --> 00:09:05.103
who are very comfortable with purchasing online

239
00:09:05.103 --> 00:09:06.322
and researching online.

240
00:09:06.322 --> 00:09:09.666
<v Voiceover>So, for example, the savvy companies--</v>

241
00:09:09.666 --> 00:09:11.802
Let's use an example, say, of Pottery Barn

242
00:09:11.802 --> 00:09:13.172
in the United States.

243
00:09:13.172 --> 00:09:15.703
Pottery Barn still has their retail outlets.

244
00:09:15.703 --> 00:09:17.236
You can go and touch and feel.

245
00:09:17.236 --> 00:09:18.408
It's nicely done.

246
00:09:18.408 --> 00:09:19.720
But at the same time, they'll send you

247
00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.717
a beautiful, glossy catalog each month.

248
00:09:21.717 --> 00:09:25.351
Then they'll send you their online newsletters and alerts.

249
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:28.161
How has a profile like that changed

250
00:09:28.161 --> 00:09:30.494
within the structure of their company?

251
00:09:30.494 --> 00:09:32.990
Does that mean they close down more stores, naturally?

252
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.802
Or are they at the leading edge of that wave?

253
00:09:34.802 --> 00:09:37.635
<v ->I think they've managed their transition very well.</v>

254
00:09:37.635 --> 00:09:38.598
There are retail outlets

255
00:09:38.598 --> 00:09:41.872
where you still need a retail presence.

256
00:09:41.872 --> 00:09:43.834
I don't think people are about to buy their clothes

257
00:09:43.834 --> 00:09:45.169
without trying them on.

258
00:09:45.169 --> 00:09:46.714
Although, a number of companies grew up,

259
00:09:46.714 --> 00:09:49.906
and were quite successful selling off the peg

260
00:09:49.906 --> 00:09:52.182
to predefined sizes.

261
00:09:52.182 --> 00:09:53.912
Some of them got very clever.

262
00:09:53.912 --> 00:09:56.594
We had the situation where LandsEnd.com

263
00:09:56.594 --> 00:09:58.683
would allow you to put in your vital statistics.

264
00:09:58.683 --> 00:10:01.992
And then show you models who had the same shape as you,

265
00:10:01.992 --> 00:10:03.861
what they looked like in their clothes.

266
00:10:03.861 --> 00:10:06.265
We had another company called, Eyeglasses.com.

267
00:10:06.265 --> 00:10:09.864
I used to wear glasses, then I had Lasik surgery.

268
00:10:09.864 --> 00:10:12.267
They would enable you to upload a picture

269
00:10:12.267 --> 00:10:13.475
of yourself.

270
00:10:13.475 --> 00:10:16.098
Then they would let you put on glasses

271
00:10:16.098 --> 00:10:17.538
onto your face.

272
00:10:17.538 --> 00:10:18.571
What they did is,

273
00:10:18.571 --> 00:10:20.406
they just made the glasses opaque

274
00:10:20.406 --> 00:10:22.507
so that you would see the frame of the glasses.

275
00:10:22.507 --> 00:10:24.341
You would show them where your eyes were.

276
00:10:24.341 --> 00:10:27.047
They would then put different pairs of glasses on you.

277
00:10:27.047 --> 00:10:29.090
Then they would match your prescription.

278
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.017
They did moderately well.

279
00:10:31.017 --> 00:10:34.187
They didn't change the face of optometry overnight,

280
00:10:34.187 --> 00:10:37.623
but it was a very interesting way to choose your glasses

281
00:10:37.623 --> 00:10:39.725
once you knew what your prescription was.

282
00:10:39.725 --> 00:10:42.592
Of course, sunglasses could be bought in the same way.

283
00:10:42.592 --> 00:10:44.833
The reality, though, for the casual wearer

284
00:10:44.833 --> 00:10:47.933
of glasses now, is we've also gone into mass production,

285
00:10:47.933 --> 00:10:50.208
so that if you know your prescription is plus one,

286
00:10:50.208 --> 00:10:52.438
or minus two, you can buy them off the shelf

287
00:10:52.438 --> 00:10:54.307
in shops like Hallmark.

288
00:10:54.307 --> 00:10:56.339
So, we have commoditized what used

289
00:10:56.339 --> 00:10:57.743
to be a specfic industry.

290
00:10:57.743 --> 00:10:59.601
Just as we did with stockbrokers.

291
00:10:59.601 --> 00:11:00.948
We used to charge--

292
00:11:00.948 --> 00:11:01.714
What was it?

293
00:11:01.714 --> 00:11:03.472
Half a percent, one percent?

294
00:11:03.472 --> 00:11:05.121
For a transaction that we're now carrying out

295
00:11:05.121 --> 00:11:06.920
on the Internet for four dollars.

296
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.488
I think that's the cheapest I've seen it.

297
00:11:08.488 --> 00:11:10.926
A whole slew of people that could be employed

298
00:11:10.926 --> 00:11:13.631
in that industry have really been broadsided

299
00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:15.128
by technology.

300
00:11:15.128 --> 00:11:16.998
We don't need the personal touch

301
00:11:16.998 --> 00:11:19.935
to make a transaction, to buy and sell shares today.

302
00:11:19.935 --> 00:11:22.907
I think that in terms of the way that the SEC goes,

303
00:11:22.907 --> 00:11:25.508
I think there is an inevitability that more technology

304
00:11:25.508 --> 00:11:27.679
is going to be implemented to make sure

305
00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:29.943
that we all get the same view of the data

306
00:11:29.943 --> 00:11:32.613
and level the playing field for the broker

307
00:11:32.613 --> 00:11:36.050
versus the individual in the not too distant future.

308
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.151
<v Voiceover>So, what does this do the face</v>

309
00:11:38.151 --> 00:11:40.926
of the solo business owner?

310
00:11:40.926 --> 00:11:42.052
We already know what's happening

311
00:11:42.052 --> 00:11:42.992
in the case of Walmart

312
00:11:42.992 --> 00:11:45.024
and small hardware stores, et cetera.

313
00:11:45.024 --> 00:11:46.290
I mean, that's a classic example

314
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.496
of the mom and pop closing down.

315
00:11:48.496 --> 00:11:51.386
How, in this culture that we are going

316
00:11:51.386 --> 00:11:53.627
to be seeing in the future and that is already present

317
00:11:53.627 --> 00:11:56.472
to an extent, will the individual business owner

318
00:11:56.472 --> 00:11:57.702
even fit in?

319
00:11:57.702 --> 00:11:59.908
The mom and pop who has a nice little dress shop,

320
00:11:59.908 --> 00:12:00.709
for example.

321
00:12:00.709 --> 00:12:02.769
Will there still be a place for this?

322
00:12:02.769 --> 00:12:05.950
<v ->I think in personal apparel, I think they have a place.</v>

323
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.110
But I do think that it will be very difficult

324
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.790
to sell commodity products profitably in the high street.

325
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:15.157
Quite simply, once the consumer regards your product

326
00:12:15.157 --> 00:12:18.199
as a commodity, you have nowhere to go.

327
00:12:18.199 --> 00:12:20.161
You can only compete on price.

328
00:12:20.161 --> 00:12:21.728
Whenever there's a service element,

329
00:12:21.728 --> 00:12:24.968
a service delivery element embedded,

330
00:12:24.968 --> 00:12:27.197
there is a place for the retailer.

331
00:12:27.197 --> 00:12:29.435
In the hospitality industry, for some time,

332
00:12:29.435 --> 00:12:32.105
everybody predicted the doom of the travel agent.

333
00:12:32.105 --> 00:12:35.205
Let's not be defensive.

334
00:12:35.205 --> 00:12:37.376
There has been an enormous shake-out

335
00:12:37.376 --> 00:12:41.045
of travel agencies who just simply took the booking.

336
00:12:41.045 --> 00:12:44.215
There are also some incredibly successful travel agencies

337
00:12:44.215 --> 00:12:46.026
that embraced the technology

338
00:12:46.026 --> 00:12:47.791
and will still advise their clients

339
00:12:47.791 --> 00:12:49.520
on what sort of holiday they want,

340
00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.390
because they know the marketplace.

341
00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.398
People will always pay a premium

342
00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:54.966
for that personal knowledge.

343
00:12:54.966 --> 00:12:56.335
But, be it a commodity?

344
00:12:56.335 --> 00:12:58.599
No, I wouldn't open a retail store today

345
00:12:58.599 --> 00:13:00.805
and sell commodities.

346
00:13:00.805 --> 00:13:02.466
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about another industry.</v>

347
00:13:02.466 --> 00:13:04.706
Now, we're going a little bit further into the future

348
00:13:04.706 --> 00:13:07.075
in terms of the technology of the automotive industry,

349
00:13:07.075 --> 00:13:10.140
and, perhaps also that of flight.

350
00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.077
And its interface with the industries that support it,

351
00:13:13.077 --> 00:13:15.213
such as insurance.

352
00:13:15.213 --> 00:13:17.489
Let's talk about what that looks like in the future.

353
00:13:17.489 --> 00:13:20.716
<v ->Well, technology's bearing down on the insurance market.</v>

354
00:13:20.716 --> 00:13:24.664
I'm not sure they're quite fully aware of it yet.

355
00:13:24.664 --> 00:13:27.624
The automotive industry has advanced using technology

356
00:13:27.624 --> 00:13:30.028
to make our journeys safer.

357
00:13:30.028 --> 00:13:31.595
On one level you could say

358
00:13:31.595 --> 00:13:33.267
that few of us get lost.

359
00:13:33.267 --> 00:13:35.542
A lot of accidents happen when we get lost.

360
00:13:35.542 --> 00:13:37.168
With MapQuest, Yahoo Maps

361
00:13:37.168 --> 00:13:39.676
and in-car navigation systems,

362
00:13:39.676 --> 00:13:41.614
we're not going to get lost as much.

363
00:13:41.614 --> 00:13:43.948
If we're not lost, we know the roads we're on.

364
00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.620
We're not looking around for road signs.

365
00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.582
We're going to have less accidents.

366
00:13:47.582 --> 00:13:49.184
We've already got the technology that was released

367
00:13:49.184 --> 00:13:51.920
at the Las Vegas technology show this year,

368
00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.859
which is tracking our eye movements.

369
00:13:53.859 --> 00:13:55.995
It's going to beep at us if we are not looking

370
00:13:55.995 --> 00:13:57.423
at the road ahead.

371
00:13:57.423 --> 00:13:59.165
It could even beep at you if you haven't looked

372
00:13:59.165 --> 00:14:01.057
in your rear view mirror for 10 seconds.

373
00:14:01.057 --> 00:14:04.029
It can even beep at you if you've put your indicator on

374
00:14:04.029 --> 00:14:06.003
before you've looked in both wing mirrors.

375
00:14:06.003 --> 00:14:07.431
It's going to beep at you.

376
00:14:07.431 --> 00:14:10.066
It's going to teach you to drive properly,

377
00:14:10.066 --> 00:14:12.493
if you choose to take the cue from it

378
00:14:12.493 --> 00:14:13.979
that says, "There's an alarm here.

379
00:14:13.979 --> 00:14:16.080
"I haven't looked where I should be looking."

380
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.076
Most accidents are caused by driver distraction.

381
00:14:19.076 --> 00:14:21.154
So if you keep people focused on the road,

382
00:14:21.154 --> 00:14:24.509
hopefully it will reduce the number of accidents.

383
00:14:24.509 --> 00:14:26.286
<v Voiceover>So, is this technology--</v>

384
00:14:26.286 --> 00:14:28.085
Let me just go back for a second.

385
00:14:28.085 --> 00:14:29.552
The technology you were speaking about,

386
00:14:29.552 --> 00:14:30.921
that you saw at the show in Las Vegas.

387
00:14:30.921 --> 00:14:32.926
Is that something that is going to be standard

388
00:14:32.926 --> 00:14:33.995
in autos in the future?

389
00:14:33.995 --> 00:14:35.339
Or is this optional?

390
00:14:35.339 --> 00:14:36.096
How does this--

391
00:14:36.096 --> 00:14:37.768
<v ->I don't think we'll see it arrive in cars</v>

392
00:14:37.768 --> 00:14:38.766
in two or three years.

393
00:14:38.766 --> 00:14:40.775
But it is one of those added benefits

394
00:14:40.775 --> 00:14:43.074
in the elite, luxury car market

395
00:14:43.074 --> 00:14:45.140
that people might pay a bit more for.

396
00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.242
What we normally see is the introductions

397
00:14:47.242 --> 00:14:48.983
of technology and safety mechanisms,

398
00:14:48.983 --> 00:14:50.550
like ABS brakes.

399
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.486
They came into the luxury market first,

400
00:14:52.486 --> 00:14:54.878
then they worked their way back to being standard.

401
00:14:54.878 --> 00:14:58.558
That will be, I believe, the modus operandi

402
00:14:58.558 --> 00:15:00.323
for all these new technologies.

403
00:15:00.323 --> 00:15:02.111
But in the end, they will make us safer.

404
00:15:02.111 --> 00:15:04.131
Airbags, for instance, were not standard

405
00:15:04.131 --> 00:15:05.129
and now they are.

406
00:15:05.129 --> 00:15:07.161
Now we're talking about side-impact airbags.

407
00:15:07.161 --> 00:15:08.903
We're talking about--

408
00:15:08.903 --> 00:15:11.526
OK, if we are in an accident, how do we make it safer?

409
00:15:11.526 --> 00:15:14.440
How do we build a car that doesn't damage the pedestrian

410
00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.262
if we're involved in an accident with a pedestrian.

411
00:15:17.262 --> 00:15:19.177
But we also have the radar technology

412
00:15:19.177 --> 00:15:21.743
that, basically, is saying, "Are we too close,

413
00:15:21.743 --> 00:15:23.078
"for the speed that we're doing,

414
00:15:23.078 --> 00:15:24.413
"to the car in front?"

415
00:15:24.413 --> 00:15:27.177
If we are, again, either an alarm can sound,

416
00:15:27.177 --> 00:15:28.976
or maybe we configure the car and say,

417
00:15:28.976 --> 00:15:30.787
you cannot get too close for the speed

418
00:15:30.787 --> 00:15:32.773
you are doing, for the road conditions

419
00:15:32.773 --> 00:15:34.024
to the car in front.

420
00:15:34.024 --> 00:15:36.625
All of these should reduce the number

421
00:15:36.625 --> 00:15:38.331
of accidents we see on the roads

422
00:15:38.331 --> 00:15:41.013
and make car driving a safer entity.

423
00:15:41.013 --> 00:15:42.093
When my children drive,

424
00:15:42.093 --> 00:15:45.019
I will take every single item

425
00:15:45.019 --> 00:15:48.537
of technology I can to make it safe.

426
00:15:48.537 --> 00:15:50.801
I think a 16 year-old driving a car in America

427
00:15:50.801 --> 00:15:52.937
is highly likely to have an accident.

428
00:15:52.937 --> 00:15:55.445
That's what the insurance statistics say,

429
00:15:55.445 --> 00:15:57.418
and that's why you're charged so much.

430
00:15:57.418 --> 00:15:58.811
But if we could make an environment,

431
00:15:58.811 --> 00:16:01.006
even with more cars on the road,

432
00:16:01.006 --> 00:16:04.849
that is safer, we should have less accidents.

433
00:16:04.849 --> 00:16:08.018
We shouldn't have as many insurance claims,

434
00:16:08.018 --> 00:16:10.421
which should mean that our premiums go down.

435
00:16:10.421 --> 00:16:11.524
Whether that will mean

436
00:16:11.524 --> 00:16:14.833
that one day insurance companies will consolidate

437
00:16:14.833 --> 00:16:16.284
remains to be seen.

438
00:16:16.284 --> 00:16:17.666
But they will not have to function

439
00:16:17.666 --> 00:16:19.268
in the way they function today.

440
00:16:19.268 --> 00:16:21.068
I'm sure as we embed the technology

441
00:16:21.068 --> 00:16:23.668
in the car, the insurance industry should catch up

442
00:16:23.668 --> 00:16:26.501
with us and say, OK, if we're using the technology

443
00:16:26.501 --> 00:16:28.642
insurance will be cheaper.

444
00:16:28.642 --> 00:16:30.112
<v Voiceover>Let's take it out even further</v>

445
00:16:30.112 --> 00:16:32.039
into the future where the technology

446
00:16:32.039 --> 00:16:34.141
in automotives is getting to the point

447
00:16:34.141 --> 00:16:36.741
where you don't need to have a driver.

448
00:16:36.741 --> 00:16:38.750
<v ->Well, of course we've seen this,</v>

449
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.456
first of all, with military applications.

450
00:16:40.456 --> 00:16:43.301
A lot of technology is invented by the military.

451
00:16:43.301 --> 00:16:45.797
In the military world today, we're already seeing drones

452
00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:48.235
operating in Afghanistan and Iraq.

453
00:16:48.235 --> 00:16:49.791
These are pilot-less aircraft.

454
00:16:49.791 --> 00:16:52.670
We know that we can fly any aircraft today

455
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.063
that has autopilot.

456
00:16:54.063 --> 00:16:56.339
But as individuals we feel a little more comfortable

457
00:16:56.339 --> 00:16:58.475
if we've got people driving our planes.

458
00:16:58.475 --> 00:17:00.844
Maybe that will change over time.

459
00:17:00.844 --> 00:17:04.083
Cars today can do a certain amount of driving themselves.

460
00:17:04.083 --> 00:17:05.882
We know that trains drive themselves.

461
00:17:05.882 --> 00:17:07.879
If you go to Dallas-Fort Worth airport,

462
00:17:07.879 --> 00:17:09.748
you will get on a pilot-less tram,

463
00:17:09.748 --> 00:17:10.991
and you're quite happy traveling

464
00:17:10.991 --> 00:17:12.349
between the terminals.

465
00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:14.520
We know that the technology is here today

466
00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.424
to allow us to get into a vehicle

467
00:17:16.424 --> 00:17:18.131
and it will drive us from A to B.

468
00:17:18.131 --> 00:17:20.697
It's a combination of the geographic positioning systems,

469
00:17:20.697 --> 00:17:23.100
the ability to embed wires in the road

470
00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.399
and the ability to know what is around the car

471
00:17:25.399 --> 00:17:26.664
at any time.

472
00:17:26.664 --> 00:17:28.742
If I was to go on holiday with my family

473
00:17:28.742 --> 00:17:30.600
from Phoenix, and I knew that I could get

474
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:34.408
into my car and go to sleep at 10 o'clock at night

475
00:17:34.408 --> 00:17:36.846
and wake up in San Diego at six am,

476
00:17:36.846 --> 00:17:38.576
and not have touched the steering wheel,

477
00:17:38.576 --> 00:17:40.770
I would actually think that was a pretty good deal

478
00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:42.187
for a weekend away.

479
00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:44.880
It think there are people ready to use that technology.

480
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.819
I think the worry is when we mix the technologies

481
00:17:46.819 --> 00:17:48.619
of people who don't have it

482
00:17:48.619 --> 00:17:51.591
versus people that do, there's still the capacity

483
00:17:51.591 --> 00:17:54.064
for humans to do something unexpected.

484
00:17:54.064 --> 00:17:56.200
You may not be able to write the computer program

485
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.037
that's going to deal with every occurrence.

486
00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:01.336
But the idea that our cars will drive themselves

487
00:18:01.336 --> 00:18:03.542
has more impact for the automotive industry.

488
00:18:03.542 --> 00:18:06.909
It's a quantum leap for the insurer

489
00:18:06.909 --> 00:18:08.882
because we shouldn't be having accidents.

490
00:18:08.882 --> 00:18:12.446
So, do you need insurance if you're using that technology?

491
00:18:12.446 --> 00:18:17.090
Additionally, the car manufacturer has to build a car

492
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:18.925
that, maybe, doesn't have a steering wheel.

493
00:18:18.925 --> 00:18:20.388
It becomes a pod.

494
00:18:20.388 --> 00:18:23.325
They become, potentially, very generic devices.

495
00:18:23.325 --> 00:18:25.159
There are two trends that I see at the moment

496
00:18:25.159 --> 00:18:26.831
which are both very interesting.

497
00:18:26.831 --> 00:18:30.732
One of which is, people offering a car rental service.

498
00:18:30.732 --> 00:18:33.066
They're doing this by having cars available

499
00:18:33.066 --> 00:18:35.806
in specific locations on a membership basis

500
00:18:35.806 --> 00:18:37.269
in some of the busy cities.

501
00:18:37.269 --> 00:18:38.772
This is a company called Zipcar.

502
00:18:38.772 --> 00:18:40.432
It think the jury's still out, ultimately

503
00:18:40.432 --> 00:18:42.243
as to whether it'll be successful.

504
00:18:42.243 --> 00:18:45.180
But it's targeting the young, upwardly mobile professional,

505
00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.245
probably renting a flat in a district of a city

506
00:18:48.245 --> 00:18:50.347
where parking is exceptionally difficult.

507
00:18:50.347 --> 00:18:52.657
They may only need a car on a weekend

508
00:18:52.657 --> 00:18:57.220
or maybe to go once a week to an evening class.

509
00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.031
Every other day they're getting on the train,

510
00:18:59.031 --> 00:19:01.028
the underground, the bus to go to work

511
00:19:01.028 --> 00:19:02.503
and travel back.

512
00:19:02.503 --> 00:19:04.302
If parking your car is a problem,

513
00:19:04.302 --> 00:19:06.334
then being able to have access to a car

514
00:19:06.334 --> 00:19:08.470
that you aren't parking and you aren't servicing

515
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:10.072
and you aren't paying insurance on,

516
00:19:10.072 --> 00:19:12.812
three times a week is a beautiful idea.

517
00:19:12.812 --> 00:19:15.541
Of course, they've consolidated on only one vehicle.

518
00:19:15.541 --> 00:19:17.143
It's the Ford Focus.

519
00:19:17.143 --> 00:19:19.151
It's embedded with a GPS chip.

520
00:19:19.151 --> 00:19:20.579
So, essentially, they know where all

521
00:19:20.579 --> 00:19:22.321
of these cars are at any time.

522
00:19:22.321 --> 00:19:23.656
They service them at night.

523
00:19:23.656 --> 00:19:26.117
They fill them up with gas overnight.

524
00:19:26.117 --> 00:19:27.824
You book online.

525
00:19:27.824 --> 00:19:29.960
It tells you where you'll pick-up your car from.

526
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.096
You'll be able to see whether it's there.

527
00:19:32.096 --> 00:19:33.025
You travel.

528
00:19:33.025 --> 00:19:35.336
You get a key fob, which has an RF device.

529
00:19:35.336 --> 00:19:36.752
You dab it on the wind screen.

530
00:19:36.752 --> 00:19:37.785
It knows it's you.

531
00:19:37.785 --> 00:19:39.527
It will open the doors for you.

532
00:19:39.527 --> 00:19:41.605
It will then allow you to drive that car

533
00:19:41.605 --> 00:19:43.602
to wherever you wanted to go.

534
00:19:43.602 --> 00:19:45.738
You book it for a set amount of time.

535
00:19:45.738 --> 00:19:47.480
There are penalties if you don't return it

536
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.012
to where it's supposed to be.

537
00:19:49.012 --> 00:19:50.243
If you're involved in an accident,

538
00:19:50.243 --> 00:19:51.485
well, it knows.

539
00:19:51.485 --> 00:19:54.353
It has these sort of OnStar capabilities.

540
00:19:54.353 --> 00:19:56.048
They will come and deal with it.

541
00:19:56.048 --> 00:19:57.081
But the beauty of this is

542
00:19:57.081 --> 00:19:59.252
we're sharing the vehicle.

543
00:19:59.252 --> 00:20:01.017
Keep that in your head for awhile.

544
00:20:01.017 --> 00:20:02.456
If we have driver-less cars,

545
00:20:02.456 --> 00:20:04.488
and we're prepared to share vehicles,

546
00:20:04.488 --> 00:20:06.334
and we create a network of roads

547
00:20:06.334 --> 00:20:08.993
that maybe move far quicker than we do today,

548
00:20:08.993 --> 00:20:11.663
if technology allows us to build super-light vehicles

549
00:20:11.663 --> 00:20:14.473
that will travel very fast in safety,

550
00:20:14.473 --> 00:20:16.934
maybe we'll choose not to own our own cars,

551
00:20:16.934 --> 00:20:19.779
but to call up a device, a pod if you like,

552
00:20:19.779 --> 00:20:22.449
that will take us from A to B at anytime.

553
00:20:22.449 --> 00:20:24.863
As long as there are enough of them available to us,

554
00:20:24.863 --> 00:20:26.652
we may choose not to own our own car

555
00:20:26.652 --> 00:20:30.089
because, financially that becomes very wasteful.

556
00:20:30.089 --> 00:20:33.955
I mean, building a car uses a lot of materials.

557
00:20:33.955 --> 00:20:35.325
If we could share them,

558
00:20:35.325 --> 00:20:37.415
it would change our way of life.

559
00:20:37.415 --> 00:20:39.690
I think there's a lot of barriers that we have to overcome

560
00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:42.662
before the mainstream is prepared to get rid of their car.

561
00:20:42.662 --> 00:20:44.694
However, I think the day could come

562
00:20:44.694 --> 00:20:48.131
when the advantages to us, of sharing those vehicles,

563
00:20:48.131 --> 00:20:50.069
as long as they're always available to us,

564
00:20:50.069 --> 00:20:51.741
would be there.

565
00:20:51.741 --> 00:20:53.111
You wouldn't need a garage.

566
00:20:53.111 --> 00:20:54.178
You wouldn't need to park it.

567
00:20:54.178 --> 00:20:55.223
You don't need to service it.

568
00:20:55.223 --> 00:20:56.231
You don't need to insure it.

569
00:20:56.231 --> 00:20:57.949
You do not need to fill it with gas.

570
00:20:57.949 --> 00:21:01.212
And it gets you from A to B quickly and safely.

571
00:21:01.212 --> 00:21:03.116
Of course, that changes other industries.

572
00:21:03.116 --> 00:21:04.915
The pizza delivery boy.

573
00:21:04.915 --> 00:21:07.121
The pizza arrives in a pod.

574
00:21:07.121 --> 00:21:08.224
We don't need a whole car.

575
00:21:08.224 --> 00:21:11.162
Maybe we have mini-pods that use the same circuitry

576
00:21:11.162 --> 00:21:13.460
or the same infrastructure that will deliver goods

577
00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:16.665
and services around in, not real time,

578
00:21:16.665 --> 00:21:18.929
but as fast as we can make them work.

579
00:21:18.929 --> 00:21:21.402
I mean, some people have said we might build a city

580
00:21:21.402 --> 00:21:23.538
with an underground infrastructure

581
00:21:23.538 --> 00:21:26.313
of these fast-moving electromagnetic pods

582
00:21:26.313 --> 00:21:28.077
that can deliver goods and services

583
00:21:28.077 --> 00:21:30.016
around the city very quickly.

584
00:21:30.016 --> 00:21:31.549
So, you don't need a fridge anymore.

585
00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:33.987
If you need to cook, you will call-up your ingredients

586
00:21:33.987 --> 00:21:35.786
and they'll be there in five minutes.

587
00:21:35.786 --> 00:21:37.656
I think we're well into the future here.

588
00:21:37.656 --> 00:21:39.954
But the idea of first moving to cars

589
00:21:39.954 --> 00:21:41.359
that drive themselves,

590
00:21:41.359 --> 00:21:44.122
and secondly, maybe sharing a device

591
00:21:44.122 --> 00:21:47.060
or a pod that will take us from A to B

592
00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:48.534
are certainly there.

593
00:21:48.534 --> 00:21:51.936
If it's a true network, those pods may join together

594
00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:53.503
so that you're not using as much energy

595
00:21:53.503 --> 00:21:55.640
for people who are going to the same place.

596
00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.101
Ultimately, maybe, you get into a pod

597
00:21:58.101 --> 00:22:00.643
to go to the airport and you can surround yourself

598
00:22:00.643 --> 00:22:02.931
in your pod with everything you need.

599
00:22:02.931 --> 00:22:04.974
You travel with your luggage.

600
00:22:04.974 --> 00:22:05.984
You go on a plane.

601
00:22:05.984 --> 00:22:08.712
You travel to a remote destination.

602
00:22:08.712 --> 00:22:12.184
You arrive and it's a painless experience,

603
00:22:12.184 --> 00:22:15.179
surrounded by the entertainment that you choose.

604
00:22:15.179 --> 00:22:17.954
That leads to another interesting story

605
00:22:17.954 --> 00:22:19.487
that I'd like to tell you.

606
00:22:19.487 --> 00:22:21.862
I attended an innovation workshop

607
00:22:21.862 --> 00:22:24.231
where the tutor came up to us and said,

608
00:22:24.231 --> 00:22:26.239
"I've got an idea.

609
00:22:26.239 --> 00:22:28.341
"Air travel, people don't like it.

610
00:22:28.341 --> 00:22:32.068
"They don't like the fact that, generally speaking,

611
00:22:32.068 --> 00:22:33.310
"it can be bumpy.

612
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.040
"You're cramped into a small space

613
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.212
"for a long period of time,

614
00:22:36.212 --> 00:22:38.302
"sharing everybody elses' germs

615
00:22:38.302 --> 00:22:40.369
"and it's an unpleasant experience.

616
00:22:40.369 --> 00:22:42.215
"Herded around like cattle.

617
00:22:42.215 --> 00:22:44.049
"What if I picked you up from your home

618
00:22:44.049 --> 00:22:45.721
"and I gave you an injection?

619
00:22:45.721 --> 00:22:47.683
"I put you in a little pod and at the bottom

620
00:22:47.683 --> 00:22:49.262
"of the pod was your luggage.

621
00:22:49.262 --> 00:22:51.828
"You go to sleep in a air conditioned environment.

622
00:22:51.828 --> 00:22:53.151
"We then take you to the airport.

623
00:22:53.151 --> 00:22:54.928
"We stack you ten deep on a plane,

624
00:22:54.928 --> 00:22:56.263
"all fully air conditioned.

625
00:22:56.263 --> 00:22:58.062
"Your heart is monitored.

626
00:22:58.062 --> 00:23:00.187
"I will fly you to where you're going.

627
00:23:00.187 --> 00:23:01.789
"At the other end I could wake you up

628
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:02.962
"with an injection."

629
00:23:02.962 --> 00:23:04.471
<v Voiceover>Doesn't sound warm and fuzzy</v>

630
00:23:04.471 --> 00:23:06.538
to begin with, but I can see where you're headed.

631
00:23:06.538 --> 00:23:07.246
(laughs)

632
00:23:07.246 --> 00:23:08.999
<v ->We all looked at him in astonishment.</v>

633
00:23:08.999 --> 00:23:11.182
I said, "There is no way I'm getting on a plane like that."

634
00:23:11.182 --> 00:23:14.282
I want to be around if anything happens.

635
00:23:14.282 --> 00:23:18.206
It was fun because it's actually very easy to defend that.

636
00:23:18.206 --> 00:23:20.156
No terrorism because nobody's alive--

637
00:23:20.156 --> 00:23:22.153
Well, hopefully, we're alive.

638
00:23:22.153 --> 00:23:23.628
<v Voiceover>Nobody's conscious. (laughs)</v>

639
00:23:23.628 --> 00:23:26.426
<v ->Nobody's conscious enough to do any damage.</v>

640
00:23:26.426 --> 00:23:28.864
There are a lot of safety things

641
00:23:28.864 --> 00:23:30.234
that we could keep from happening.

642
00:23:30.234 --> 00:23:31.197
Deep vein thrombosis.

643
00:23:31.197 --> 00:23:33.473
You're a lot better lying down than you are sitting

644
00:23:33.473 --> 00:23:35.133
on a plane for long periods of time.

645
00:23:35.133 --> 00:23:37.002
And you always arrive refreshed.

646
00:23:37.002 --> 00:23:39.742
On the other hand, we're just not ready for it.

647
00:23:39.742 --> 00:23:41.669
There's a slow rate of change of technology

648
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:43.248
that people will accept.

649
00:23:43.248 --> 00:23:44.607
Maybe the biggest barrier

650
00:23:44.607 --> 00:23:47.492
to us accepting technology advances is us.

651
00:23:47.492 --> 00:23:48.450
It's the rate at which

652
00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:51.225
we can effectively use that technology.

653
00:23:51.225 --> 00:23:52.525
<v Voiceover>Where are you seeing some</v>

654
00:23:52.525 --> 00:23:54.858
of the chaos at this period in history.

655
00:23:54.858 --> 00:23:56.728
Because this is a major issue.

656
00:23:56.728 --> 00:24:00.060
Technology is changing so quickly

657
00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.091
and industries are starting to dry up

658
00:24:02.091 --> 00:24:03.868
as others are being given birth to.

659
00:24:03.868 --> 00:24:07.072
How do you notice, when you're advising a company?

660
00:24:07.072 --> 00:24:08.628
How do you see us beginning

661
00:24:08.628 --> 00:24:11.739
to strategically adapt to all of this?

662
00:24:11.739 --> 00:24:14.514
<v ->We have to be aware of our complete surroundings.</v>

663
00:24:14.514 --> 00:24:16.813
As a company, you need to look at not only

664
00:24:16.813 --> 00:24:19.785
who your customers are and where they are headed,

665
00:24:19.785 --> 00:24:20.946
but you also need to look back and say,

666
00:24:20.946 --> 00:24:22.583
"Who's supplying me?"

667
00:24:22.583 --> 00:24:24.615
Because they may go out of business.

668
00:24:24.615 --> 00:24:26.577
Because there are economic loads.

669
00:24:26.577 --> 00:24:28.260
There is an economic factor that you have

670
00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:31.360
to achieve to manufacture certain goods and services.

671
00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.589
If you're using a portion of somebody's output

672
00:24:33.589 --> 00:24:35.633
but the rest of it is made redundant

673
00:24:35.633 --> 00:24:38.338
because their customer doesn't actually need

674
00:24:38.338 --> 00:24:40.331
that product anymore, you have to be aware

675
00:24:40.331 --> 00:24:43.036
that your supply chain can change drastically.

676
00:24:43.036 --> 00:24:45.010
So you have to be up to speed on what's happening

677
00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:47.169
both looking behind you at your suppliers

678
00:24:47.169 --> 00:24:49.306
as well as looking forwards into the market

679
00:24:49.306 --> 00:24:52.580
at how the consumer or customer is going to behave.

680
00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.041
I think that the advent of the PDA

681
00:24:55.041 --> 00:24:56.887
that we were describing earlier needs

682
00:24:56.887 --> 00:24:58.953
to be looked at more closely.

683
00:24:58.953 --> 00:25:02.495
That device can be your office away from home.

684
00:25:02.495 --> 00:25:03.923
It can be your office anywhere.

685
00:25:03.923 --> 00:25:06.662
If we are wirelessly connected to our data,

686
00:25:06.662 --> 00:25:08.694
whether that be Word files, Excel files,

687
00:25:08.694 --> 00:25:12.094
video, music as we were talking about earlier,

688
00:25:12.094 --> 00:25:14.174
if I have access to that anywhere,

689
00:25:14.174 --> 00:25:17.402
I can be online and effectively productive anywhere

690
00:25:17.402 --> 00:25:18.876
in the world.

691
00:25:18.876 --> 00:25:21.012
My friends all carry the Blackberry today.

692
00:25:21.012 --> 00:25:22.510
Wirelessly connected to the Internet,

693
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:24.681
they get Email 24 hours a day.

694
00:25:24.681 --> 00:25:26.016
They can use it wherever they are

695
00:25:26.016 --> 00:25:28.420
in the world that gets a wireless signal.

696
00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.949
That increases the megahertz or the frequency

697
00:25:31.949 --> 00:25:34.190
with which we're able to operate the economy.

698
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:36.129
Gone are the days where we'd send a letter

699
00:25:36.129 --> 00:25:37.185
asking for a quote.

700
00:25:37.185 --> 00:25:38.590
It would come back.

701
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:40.900
The speed that the economy works at today

702
00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.396
with Email, we can make informed decisions

703
00:25:43.396 --> 00:25:45.033
very, very quickly.

704
00:25:45.033 --> 00:25:46.102
We have to be aware

705
00:25:46.102 --> 00:25:48.667
that not only can we make informed decisions quickly,

706
00:25:48.667 --> 00:25:50.641
our customers make informed decisions.

707
00:25:50.641 --> 00:25:52.870
If we're not the leading player in a market,

708
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:56.040
and we don't have a price differential

709
00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.547
to cope with the fact that we don't have the best product,

710
00:25:58.547 --> 00:26:00.916
it's highly likely that we'll find it very difficult

711
00:26:00.916 --> 00:26:02.216
to survive.

712
00:26:02.216 --> 00:26:04.318
Anticipating what the market will want

713
00:26:04.318 --> 00:26:07.023
is key to your future success.

714
00:26:07.023 --> 00:26:07.952
But just as we were saying

715
00:26:07.952 --> 00:26:09.821
that those individual technologies

716
00:26:09.821 --> 00:26:12.735
that we surround ourselves may be made redundant

717
00:26:12.735 --> 00:26:15.161
as we consolidate them into one device.

718
00:26:15.161 --> 00:26:18.760
That device fulfills a very interesting role in us all.

719
00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.630
It is our entertainment system.

720
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:22.743
It is our communications device.

721
00:26:22.743 --> 00:26:24.310
It's always with us

722
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:27.909
to the extent that it would be our key to our front door.

723
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:30.942
It would be infrared, enabled our front door

724
00:26:30.942 --> 00:26:32.544
just as hotel doors are.

725
00:26:32.544 --> 00:26:35.411
We'll have some element of technology within it.

726
00:26:35.411 --> 00:26:39.579
We will embed our thumbprint or some eyeprint factor

727
00:26:39.579 --> 00:26:42.888
into the usage of that technology to keep it secure.

728
00:26:42.888 --> 00:26:47.323
If it is secure, we will totally depend on this one device.

729
00:26:47.323 --> 00:26:49.193
We may totally depend on it to the extent

730
00:26:49.193 --> 00:26:52.200
that we would like to embed it in our bodies

731
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.196
so that we never lose it.

732
00:26:54.196 --> 00:26:56.867
Without it, we may become totally lost.

733
00:26:56.867 --> 00:26:59.270
This is one of the theories of networking

734
00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:01.295
that we have today is that

735
00:27:01.295 --> 00:27:03.775
if your data is available somewhere,

736
00:27:03.775 --> 00:27:04.709
you're connected.

737
00:27:04.709 --> 00:27:06.567
If you keep all your data to yourself,

738
00:27:06.567 --> 00:27:08.691
like we may do in our household PC,

739
00:27:08.691 --> 00:27:10.305
someday it will fail.

740
00:27:10.305 --> 00:27:12.255
And we're not very good at backing it up.

741
00:27:12.255 --> 00:27:14.554
So, we need to be aware that the vitality

742
00:27:14.554 --> 00:27:18.362
or the essential essence of our data is us.

743
00:27:18.362 --> 00:27:20.429
As we put more and more information

744
00:27:20.429 --> 00:27:22.867
into these devices, we're gonna feel more and more lost

745
00:27:22.867 --> 00:27:24.063
if we lose them.

746
00:27:24.063 --> 00:27:25.468
Now, that may result in us saying,

747
00:27:25.468 --> 00:27:27.139
"I don't ever want me to be separated

748
00:27:27.139 --> 00:27:29.009
"from that technology."

749
00:27:29.009 --> 00:27:30.971
At which stage we may choose to embed it

750
00:27:30.971 --> 00:27:32.666
in our bodies.

751
00:27:32.666 --> 00:27:34.744
Which lead us to a couple of other technologies

752
00:27:34.744 --> 00:27:36.497
that i'd like to talk about.

753
00:27:36.497 --> 00:27:39.376
One of which is the man-machine interface.

754
00:27:39.376 --> 00:27:42.012
I mean, today we've moved from a keyboard

755
00:27:42.012 --> 00:27:44.252
to a mouse to a little pointer

756
00:27:44.252 --> 00:27:46.756
that we may have in the middle of our laptop.

757
00:27:46.756 --> 00:27:48.788
We've started to think about new ways.

758
00:27:48.788 --> 00:27:50.262
We tried voice recognition,

759
00:27:50.262 --> 00:27:51.656
which is getting better and better.

760
00:27:51.656 --> 00:27:54.233
But we need that instant interaction

761
00:27:54.233 --> 00:27:57.100
with the computing power that we carry with us.

762
00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.620
People today are looking at mind interfaces.

763
00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.489
There are two or three things going on

764
00:28:01.489 --> 00:28:03.637
that I believe will lead us, eventually,

765
00:28:03.637 --> 00:28:06.168
to mind control over that device.

766
00:28:06.168 --> 00:28:08.107
Which may ultimately mean that we choose

767
00:28:08.107 --> 00:28:10.614
to embed that technology in our brains.

768
00:28:10.614 --> 00:28:11.984
Now, there are things that we have to overcome

769
00:28:11.984 --> 00:28:13.203
from a health perspective.

770
00:28:13.203 --> 00:28:15.049
It's never a good thing to embed anything

771
00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:17.186
in our bodies that's foreign.

772
00:28:17.186 --> 00:28:20.188
Also, if we are wirelessly connecting ourselves

773
00:28:20.188 --> 00:28:23.211
to these devices, I think the jury's still out

774
00:28:23.211 --> 00:28:24.964
on whether those wireless waves

775
00:28:24.964 --> 00:28:27.228
that are coming in and using our cell phones today

776
00:28:27.228 --> 00:28:29.399
are actually damaging us in some way.

777
00:28:29.399 --> 00:28:31.257
But let's talk about those technologies

778
00:28:31.257 --> 00:28:33.265
that I believe will drastically change the way

779
00:28:33.265 --> 00:28:35.901
we interface with technology.

780
00:28:35.901 --> 00:28:37.132
The first of which was sponsored

781
00:28:37.132 --> 00:28:39.337
by the U. S. Department of Defense.

782
00:28:39.337 --> 00:28:41.079
That, in itself, is a bit worrying.

783
00:28:41.079 --> 00:28:42.739
But we'll push that to one side.

784
00:28:42.739 --> 00:28:45.537
It started off by U. S. pilots being asked

785
00:28:45.537 --> 00:28:47.453
to move a dot across the screen

786
00:28:47.453 --> 00:28:49.148
whilst they wore a helmet configured

787
00:28:49.148 --> 00:28:50.611
with electrodes.

788
00:28:50.611 --> 00:28:53.223
They were asked to think about a list of subjects.

789
00:28:53.223 --> 00:28:55.023
One of them might have been a waterfall.

790
00:28:55.023 --> 00:28:56.660
One of them might have been going to sleep.

791
00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:58.598
One of them might have been driving a car.

792
00:28:58.598 --> 00:29:00.700
What they did is, they noticed

793
00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.128
what the brainwaves did as they thought

794
00:29:02.128 --> 00:29:03.335
about these things.

795
00:29:03.335 --> 00:29:04.229
Then they noticed that

796
00:29:04.229 --> 00:29:06.697
where they could pick-up a strong brain wave

797
00:29:06.697 --> 00:29:08.241
in a particular area of the brain,

798
00:29:08.241 --> 00:29:09.843
they said, "OK, let's allow the cursor

799
00:29:09.843 --> 00:29:11.503
"to move from the left to the right.

800
00:29:11.503 --> 00:29:13.140
"Or, go in a rightwards direction,

801
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.207
"a leftwards, upwards, downwards on the screen,

802
00:29:15.207 --> 00:29:17.448
"when we see these traits."

803
00:29:17.448 --> 00:29:19.979
In this way, the pilots gradually learned

804
00:29:19.979 --> 00:29:21.349
by doing this for two hours a day

805
00:29:21.349 --> 00:29:24.147
for 30 days, they could move the cursor

806
00:29:24.147 --> 00:29:25.664
across the screen.

807
00:29:25.664 --> 00:29:27.429
Of course, in the end, they didn't need to think

808
00:29:27.429 --> 00:29:29.152
about anything but moving the cursor

809
00:29:29.152 --> 00:29:30.719
because the brain was clever enough

810
00:29:30.719 --> 00:29:32.728
to work out what it needed to do

811
00:29:32.728 --> 00:29:34.667
to move the pointer.

812
00:29:34.667 --> 00:29:35.967
Now, the good news is that

813
00:29:35.967 --> 00:29:37.662
that had a practical application.

814
00:29:37.662 --> 00:29:39.671
What we started to see was a couple

815
00:29:39.671 --> 00:29:41.772
of companies get funding from the U.S. Department of Defense

816
00:29:41.772 --> 00:29:43.107
to study this.

817
00:29:43.107 --> 00:29:44.802
There was a company called, Cyberkinetics,

818
00:29:44.802 --> 00:29:47.670
who came up with a product called, Brain Gate.

819
00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:50.340
There's a young man by the name of Mr. Crane

820
00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.881
who was involved in a tragic stabbing through his neck.

821
00:29:53.881 --> 00:29:56.575
He became a C-4 paraplegic.

822
00:29:56.575 --> 00:29:58.792
He was chomping at the bit to do something useful

823
00:29:58.792 --> 00:30:01.253
with his life and volunteered to be one

824
00:30:01.253 --> 00:30:02.554
of the first guinea pigs.

825
00:30:02.554 --> 00:30:04.063
The FDA allowed five people

826
00:30:04.063 --> 00:30:06.130
to become human guinea pigs.

827
00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:07.523
What they have done is

828
00:30:07.523 --> 00:30:09.717
they have performed an operation

829
00:30:09.717 --> 00:30:12.086
and put a chip inside his cortex,

830
00:30:12.086 --> 00:30:14.535
which can read neurons firing.

831
00:30:14.535 --> 00:30:16.602
Now, they put this in the area of the brain

832
00:30:16.602 --> 00:30:18.274
that controls your hands

833
00:30:18.274 --> 00:30:19.876
and your movement in your arms.

834
00:30:19.876 --> 00:30:21.942
They knew where that was.

835
00:30:21.942 --> 00:30:23.974
He has wires that come out of his brain.

836
00:30:23.974 --> 00:30:25.843
Then they connect and it's connected

837
00:30:25.843 --> 00:30:27.678
to a large computer.

838
00:30:27.678 --> 00:30:30.487
This device is able, in theory,

839
00:30:30.487 --> 00:30:31.857
to allow him to think about

840
00:30:31.857 --> 00:30:34.017
how he used to move his hands.

841
00:30:34.017 --> 00:30:35.956
Then it starts to move the cursor

842
00:30:35.956 --> 00:30:38.254
from left to right, up and down.

843
00:30:38.254 --> 00:30:39.462
The great aspect of this,

844
00:30:39.462 --> 00:30:40.623
if it can be made to work is,

845
00:30:40.623 --> 00:30:44.536
if he can fire those neurons correctly still,

846
00:30:44.536 --> 00:30:46.532
could we wirelessly connect all

847
00:30:46.532 --> 00:30:48.355
of his muscles groups together

848
00:30:48.355 --> 00:30:49.934
and allow him to move again?

849
00:30:49.934 --> 00:30:51.200
Now, that's the ultimate goal

850
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.570
and we're some way off it.

851
00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:55.101
But right now, this individual has sat

852
00:30:55.101 --> 00:30:56.772
in front of a computer screen,

853
00:30:56.772 --> 00:30:59.315
can move a cursor and actually, in effect, do

854
00:30:59.315 --> 00:31:01.149
what we would do, which is double-click.

855
00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:03.320
He can read his own Email on a computer.

856
00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.619
He can navigate across the computer screen.

857
00:31:05.619 --> 00:31:08.057
That's a great use of this technology.

858
00:31:08.057 --> 00:31:10.089
Another company in France doing similar work

859
00:31:10.089 --> 00:31:12.295
has got a helmet, rather than embedding the chip.

860
00:31:12.295 --> 00:31:14.663
Reads the brain waves and will allow a paraplegic

861
00:31:14.663 --> 00:31:18.100
to mobilize his wheelchair.

862
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.492
When they used to us a blow tube, a blow-suck

863
00:31:20.492 --> 00:31:22.767
to control movement, he is now free of that.

864
00:31:22.767 --> 00:31:25.403
He can think his way around his house.

865
00:31:25.403 --> 00:31:28.003
Now, those are great uses of that technology.

866
00:31:28.003 --> 00:31:32.415
But what we're really doing, is we're teaching our mind

867
00:31:32.415 --> 00:31:34.888
to interface to a machine.

868
00:31:34.888 --> 00:31:37.416
Now the other aspect that I want to now touch on is,

869
00:31:37.416 --> 00:31:41.456
can we get the machine to interface to the mind?

870
00:31:41.456 --> 00:31:43.662
We've done this twice now.

871
00:31:43.662 --> 00:31:46.599
You may have heard of people who've been partially deaf.

872
00:31:46.599 --> 00:31:49.397
We have implanted a chip on the brain side

873
00:31:49.397 --> 00:31:52.590
that actually is firing electrical cells,

874
00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:55.667
or producing electricity based on the sound

875
00:31:55.667 --> 00:31:57.907
which is coming from the inner ear.

876
00:31:57.907 --> 00:32:00.171
What people who have been profoundly deaf

877
00:32:00.171 --> 00:32:01.506
for a number of years have found,

878
00:32:01.506 --> 00:32:06.046
it's confusing for a while, then the brain makes sense.

879
00:32:06.046 --> 00:32:08.356
In the end, those that have heard before,

880
00:32:08.356 --> 00:32:10.713
are saying, "I can now make out voices

881
00:32:10.713 --> 00:32:12.722
"and I can understand what they're saying.

882
00:32:12.722 --> 00:32:15.624
"It doesn't sound like it used to sound."

883
00:32:15.624 --> 00:32:19.560
However, it's actually audible speech

884
00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.429
that they can understand.

885
00:32:21.429 --> 00:32:22.764
Great move forwards.

886
00:32:22.764 --> 00:32:26.363
But the brain learned how to read those signals.

887
00:32:26.363 --> 00:32:29.103
We're also beginning to do that with the optic nerve,

888
00:32:29.103 --> 00:32:32.308
putting photo-electric cells at the back of the eye.

889
00:32:32.308 --> 00:32:34.943
With that technology, again, people are beginning

890
00:32:34.943 --> 00:32:39.181
to see a matrix of light, who've had these chips embedded

891
00:32:39.181 --> 00:32:40.446
in their eyes.

892
00:32:40.446 --> 00:32:42.350
Over time, they anticipate that they can start

893
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:43.883
to see light and dark.

894
00:32:43.883 --> 00:32:45.357
Not too many colors, but then they're beginning

895
00:32:45.357 --> 00:32:46.908
to see shapes.

896
00:32:46.908 --> 00:32:48.829
The brain is learning to intercept

897
00:32:48.829 --> 00:32:52.393
and actually get hold of that image and apply it

898
00:32:52.393 --> 00:32:55.284
in a way that the human brain can understand it.

899
00:32:55.284 --> 00:32:58.198
Now, those two examples, coupled with the example

900
00:32:58.198 --> 00:33:01.704
of us giving information back out to a machine,

901
00:33:01.704 --> 00:33:05.106
may lead us to the two-way interface.

902
00:33:05.106 --> 00:33:06.975
I find that incredibly interesting.

903
00:33:06.975 --> 00:33:10.179
If we could really learn the way that the brain works,

904
00:33:10.179 --> 00:33:13.442
could we be receiving information on-demand?

905
00:33:13.442 --> 00:33:15.683
It's like can we do the Google search

906
00:33:15.683 --> 00:33:17.947
from our mind and bring in the data,

907
00:33:17.947 --> 00:33:20.257
sort it quickly enough to be able

908
00:33:20.257 --> 00:33:21.987
to access all the information

909
00:33:21.987 --> 00:33:24.785
that Google can possible index for us

910
00:33:24.785 --> 00:33:26.933
and have it readily available to us.

911
00:33:26.933 --> 00:33:28.291
It's an interesting concept.

912
00:33:28.291 --> 00:33:29.928
<v Voiceover>It is an interesting concept.</v>

913
00:33:29.928 --> 00:33:32.633
And these are incredible and miraculous break-throughs.

914
00:33:32.633 --> 00:33:35.668
One of our other guests, Doctor Michio Kaku, also says

915
00:33:35.668 --> 00:33:38.114
we will be coming to a time when we can merge silicon

916
00:33:38.114 --> 00:33:41.206
and carbon elements together, in essence,

917
00:33:41.206 --> 00:33:43.272
and create exactly what you're talking about,

918
00:33:43.272 --> 00:33:46.709
even extrapolating out a little further down the line.

919
00:33:46.709 --> 00:33:48.416
One question I have is,

920
00:33:48.416 --> 00:33:50.354
just to take a quick look at the other side.

921
00:33:50.354 --> 00:33:52.224
Again, you said, this technology

922
00:33:52.224 --> 00:33:53.756
was primarily being developed

923
00:33:53.756 --> 00:33:55.753
by the Department of Defense.

924
00:33:55.753 --> 00:33:57.053
Is that what you said earlier?

925
00:33:57.053 --> 00:33:58.763
Did you say it was the Department of Defense?

926
00:33:58.763 --> 00:33:59.561
<v ->It is.</v>

927
00:33:59.561 --> 00:34:01.233
<v Voiceover>Yeah, so now--</v>

928
00:34:01.233 --> 00:34:02.696
Let's talk about what that might mean.

929
00:34:02.696 --> 00:34:04.461
<v ->The idea behind this, Regina, was</v>

930
00:34:04.461 --> 00:34:08.431
that if you could actually get mind control

931
00:34:08.431 --> 00:34:10.533
over devices, the idea was

932
00:34:10.533 --> 00:34:12.866
that you could send robots into battle

933
00:34:12.866 --> 00:34:14.341
with people behind them.

934
00:34:14.341 --> 00:34:17.046
So that they were making informed, intelligent decisions.

935
00:34:17.046 --> 00:34:19.913
Because we're probably far better at saying, "friend or foe"

936
00:34:19.913 --> 00:34:21.736
than a machine is today.

937
00:34:21.736 --> 00:34:23.048
So that was, I think, the thinking

938
00:34:23.048 --> 00:34:25.254
that the U. S. military had behind this.

939
00:34:25.254 --> 00:34:27.657
The other point was, at the time,

940
00:34:27.657 --> 00:34:29.945
we were still going for piloted aircraft.

941
00:34:29.945 --> 00:34:31.489
Could we do something else

942
00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:34.519
to control yet another weapon with our minds?

943
00:34:34.519 --> 00:34:37.897
Rather than having a number of fingers and feet

944
00:34:37.897 --> 00:34:40.440
working at the same time to maneuver the aircraft,

945
00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:42.472
could we think, "Arm the missile.

946
00:34:42.472 --> 00:34:44.306
"Fire it now."

947
00:34:44.306 --> 00:34:48.207
Those are the unfortunate drivers for this technology,

948
00:34:48.207 --> 00:34:51.075
but, hopefully, the practical uses may outweigh

949
00:34:51.075 --> 00:34:55.045
the military benefits they originally were pursuing.

950
00:34:55.045 --> 00:34:57.483
<v Voiceover>Isn't this going to be interesting</v>

951
00:34:57.483 --> 00:34:59.283
as all of these technologies develop

952
00:34:59.283 --> 00:35:01.419
because so much of it has to do

953
00:35:01.419 --> 00:35:05.065
with the intention of the driver slash programmer, user.

954
00:35:05.065 --> 00:35:06.156
<v ->Yup.</v>

955
00:35:06.156 --> 00:35:08.060
<v Voiceover>And we're looking at that technology,</v>

956
00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:08.966
for example.

957
00:35:08.966 --> 00:35:12.437
How might that be used if the wrong intention is

958
00:35:12.437 --> 00:35:13.528
behind it?

959
00:35:13.528 --> 00:35:15.305
<v ->Well, of course if we choose to be connected</v>

960
00:35:15.305 --> 00:35:17.871
wirelessly, 24 hours a day to a device

961
00:35:17.871 --> 00:35:22.143
that replaces our PDA, by definition it knows

962
00:35:22.143 --> 00:35:25.150
where we are because it has a GPS tracking mechanism.

963
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:28.145
I mean, in today's world, by carrying a cell phone,

964
00:35:28.145 --> 00:35:30.781
you are actually giving away your location,

965
00:35:30.781 --> 00:35:33.381
albeit it not very specifically.

966
00:35:33.381 --> 00:35:35.088
But you can be put in a specific area

967
00:35:35.088 --> 00:35:37.062
by the fact that every time your cell phone is on,

968
00:35:37.062 --> 00:35:39.094
a machine somewhere is logging the fact

969
00:35:39.094 --> 00:35:41.566
that you're closest to this tower.

970
00:35:41.566 --> 00:35:42.635
Because it needs to know

971
00:35:42.635 --> 00:35:44.330
that it can send you a telephone call,

972
00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:46.001
to a specific location.

973
00:35:46.001 --> 00:35:47.636
So, we are being tracked.

974
00:35:47.636 --> 00:35:50.039
The ultimate use of that technology

975
00:35:50.039 --> 00:35:52.210
from a location point of view says,

976
00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:54.671
"We will know where you are all the time."

977
00:35:54.671 --> 00:35:57.899
Because you will need to be in a particular cell

978
00:35:57.899 --> 00:36:00.047
to interface wirelessly to whatever it is

979
00:36:00.047 --> 00:36:02.680
that we want to interface with at that time.

980
00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:04.679
<v Voiceover>So, where does that bring potentials</v>

981
00:36:04.679 --> 00:36:06.386
as potentially frightening even,

982
00:36:06.386 --> 00:36:09.117
as the Manchurian Candidate, for example?

983
00:36:09.117 --> 00:36:10.290
<v ->It does.</v>

984
00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:13.529
As we know, often films have been great predictors

985
00:36:13.529 --> 00:36:15.131
of new technologies.

986
00:36:15.131 --> 00:36:18.161
From the early days of Star Wars all the way

987
00:36:18.161 --> 00:36:19.961
through to the present day.

988
00:36:19.961 --> 00:36:22.933
But, the benefits that it may bring the individual

989
00:36:22.933 --> 00:36:24.605
might outweigh the fears.

990
00:36:24.605 --> 00:36:26.370
That's the great unknown.

991
00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:28.970
What potential freedoms will we give up

992
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:33.846
to enjoy the ability to have an intellect

993
00:36:33.846 --> 00:36:36.018
far beyond that which we have today?

994
00:36:36.018 --> 00:36:37.446
To be able to know everything,

995
00:36:37.446 --> 00:36:39.048
to experience things?

996
00:36:39.048 --> 00:36:41.219
That gives a whole new meaning to entertainment

997
00:36:41.219 --> 00:36:42.624
because will we one day be able

998
00:36:42.624 --> 00:36:45.596
to read brain patterns and send brain patterns

999
00:36:45.596 --> 00:36:48.696
that mean we experience our entertainment.

1000
00:36:48.696 --> 00:36:50.832
And the mind goes off in all sorts of ways

1001
00:36:50.832 --> 00:36:52.364
when you do that.

1002
00:36:52.364 --> 00:36:55.740
Will we experience the Super Bowl by feeling the emotions

1003
00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.737
and what the quarterback feels,

1004
00:36:57.737 --> 00:37:00.941
in going through that process?

1005
00:37:00.941 --> 00:37:02.404
And will we live it real time,

1006
00:37:02.404 --> 00:37:04.273
or have to be living it later?

1007
00:37:04.273 --> 00:37:08.012
If we can actually experience entertainment,

1008
00:37:08.012 --> 00:37:09.544
it brings it to a whole new level.

1009
00:37:09.544 --> 00:37:11.646
People may say, "That would be great."

1010
00:37:11.646 --> 00:37:13.724
I remember a scene from The Matrix.

1011
00:37:13.724 --> 00:37:15.860
And this is the unfortunate side of what we're talking about

1012
00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.020
of leading-edge technologies.

1013
00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.761
There was a scene in The Matrix with millions

1014
00:37:19.761 --> 00:37:21.491
of pods that were actually being tapped

1015
00:37:21.491 --> 00:37:23.534
for their electrical value.

1016
00:37:23.534 --> 00:37:26.704
They were just human beings living in virtual reality.

1017
00:37:26.704 --> 00:37:28.666
Somebody said to me, the unfortunate thing is,

1018
00:37:28.666 --> 00:37:31.777
90% of the world would probably have a better life

1019
00:37:31.777 --> 00:37:34.726
in virtual reality than it does in reality.

1020
00:37:34.726 --> 00:37:36.572
We're very privileged to live where we do

1021
00:37:36.572 --> 00:37:38.918
and be having conversations about leading-edge,

1022
00:37:38.918 --> 00:37:41.309
cutting technologies when we still haven't managed

1023
00:37:41.309 --> 00:37:43.428
to feed half the world.

1024
00:37:45.511 --> 00:37:47.126
<v ->We'll be following up this interview</v>

1025
00:37:47.126 --> 00:37:49.426
with another talk with Ian in which we discuss

1026
00:37:49.426 --> 00:37:51.261
some of the more controversial,

1027
00:37:51.261 --> 00:37:52.898
many would even say disturbing,

1028
00:37:52.898 --> 00:37:54.894
technologies that lie ahead,

1029
00:37:54.894 --> 00:37:56.868
including the chip.

1030
00:37:56.868 --> 00:37:58.064
If you enjoyed this subject,

1031
00:37:58.064 --> 00:37:59.364
you'll also enjoy our interview

1032
00:37:59.364 --> 00:38:01.187
with Michio Kaku as well.

1033
00:38:01.187 --> 00:38:03.422
Until next time, thanks for watching.
