1
00:00:01.218 --> 00:00:02.888
<v ->We had the good fortune of catching up</v>

2
00:00:02.888 --> 00:00:04.523
with Christine Page again,

3
00:00:04.523 --> 00:00:06.692
this time talking to her about her new book

4
00:00:06.692 --> 00:00:09.160
2012 and the Galactic Center.

5
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.396
With all of the different interpretations of

6
00:00:11.396 --> 00:00:14.098
what this date means Christine emphasizes

7
00:00:14.098 --> 00:00:17.702
that 2012 is a time for the release of aspects of our lives

8
00:00:17.702 --> 00:00:19.471
that no longer serve us.

9
00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:21.806
She says these powerful energies will give us

10
00:00:21.806 --> 00:00:25.444
the capabilities of reaching into our highest potential.

11
00:00:25.444 --> 00:00:28.212
But first we have to answer some deeper questions.

12
00:00:28.212 --> 00:00:31.999 line:15% 
(calm music)

13
00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:40.091
Thank you for coming back again, Christine.

14
00:00:40.091 --> 00:00:41.492
I really appreciate it.

15
00:00:41.492 --> 00:00:43.160
The book that you've written, the newest one

16
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.562
I was reading recently,

17
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:49.333
you brought up so many salient points,

18
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:52.537
so many areas of consideration that we can

19
00:00:52.537 --> 00:00:54.205
barely scratch the surface.

20
00:00:54.205 --> 00:00:56.908
But really one of my favorite parts of the book

21
00:00:56.908 --> 00:00:59.110
is in the very beginning when you're talking about

22
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.783
something if a person's not paying attention

23
00:01:00.783 --> 00:01:03.181
they won't understand is a dream.

24
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:07.553
But a really, truly, deeply profound dream in which you are

25
00:01:07.553 --> 00:01:10.355
transmission of a lot of information, right?

26
00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:11.222
<v ->That's right.</v>

27
00:01:11.222 --> 00:01:13.658
<v Voiceover>And there was one toward the beginning of it,</v>

28
00:01:13.658 --> 00:01:15.460
can I just go ahead and read this one little sentence

29
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.129
and then we'll launch into conversation?

30
00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:20.865
He was saying to you many fail to appreciate

31
00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:23.869
the realm of possibilities readily available to them

32
00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.238
preferring to live within the illusory state

33
00:01:27.238 --> 00:01:30.642
of security offered by the familiar,

34
00:01:30.642 --> 00:01:33.111
the familiar experience, and it went on from there.

35
00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:35.680
And this is really critical to the time we're entering.

36
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.250
Can you talk about that from your perception

37
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.043
after you were given the information?

38
00:01:41.043 --> 00:01:43.754
<v ->I'm going to launch a little bit into 2012</v>

39
00:01:43.754 --> 00:01:47.091
which I think is really much why we're here,

40
00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:48.926
the book 2012 and the Galactic Center.

41
00:01:48.926 --> 00:01:51.762
As we're going through this time

42
00:01:51.762 --> 00:01:54.332
the alignment that's happening between the sun

43
00:01:54.332 --> 00:01:57.835
and the galactic center which is so close,

44
00:01:57.835 --> 00:02:01.372
the closer alignment than we've had for 26,000 years

45
00:02:01.372 --> 00:02:04.175
it's as if all the veils between the dimensions

46
00:02:04.175 --> 00:02:05.810
are just dissolving.

47
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.114
And we know that not only is time speeding up

48
00:02:09.114 --> 00:02:10.915
but it's also dissolving.

49
00:02:10.915 --> 00:02:12.617
So we are getting to a place where

50
00:02:12.617 --> 00:02:15.219
there is only now and people, of course,

51
00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:16.887
have spoken about that.

52
00:02:16.887 --> 00:02:19.457
But that space is very difficult

53
00:02:19.457 --> 00:02:20.859
for any of us to hang on to.

54
00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:23.661
We're so familiar with our past and our future

55
00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:25.563
and here we sit in the middle of it

56
00:02:25.563 --> 00:02:27.567
and that's the illusion.

57
00:02:27.567 --> 00:02:31.503
And for the Incas I remember Alberto Velarde say

58
00:02:31.503 --> 00:02:33.070
the Incas can't understand why people

59
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.372
would want to make time linear.

60
00:02:35.372 --> 00:02:37.508
They believe they stand in the middle

61
00:02:37.508 --> 00:02:39.778
and time exists around them,

62
00:02:39.778 --> 00:02:41.812
and I very much go along with that belief

63
00:02:41.812 --> 00:02:45.049
of us being in the center and all what we call past life

64
00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.653
so even future lives are just different petals

65
00:02:47.653 --> 00:02:49.420
of my flower.

66
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.058
But for us to go there it takes that mindset to say

67
00:02:53.058 --> 00:02:56.460
if you didn't have to be driven by your past

68
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.329
or worry about your future

69
00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.297
what would you do today?

70
00:03:00.297 --> 00:03:02.700
And that's what you mean.

71
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.402
I have chores to do, something with that.

72
00:03:04.402 --> 00:03:08.006
A familiar journey is to go back to

73
00:03:08.006 --> 00:03:10.541
I am doing this because of the past

74
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:12.910
and because I'm setting something up for the future.

75
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.347
As we are dissolving those paradigms

76
00:03:16.347 --> 00:03:20.751
are shifting at such a rate that we're seeing instant karma.

77
00:03:20.751 --> 00:03:23.088
We're seeing even more of an instant,

78
00:03:23.088 --> 00:03:25.691
things are happening for us to change the past.

79
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:28.762
So it's not just a present but what we see

80
00:03:28.762 --> 00:03:31.829
of this new world that's coming in that the Maya talk about

81
00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.231
starting with 21st of December 2012

82
00:03:34.231 --> 00:03:36.201
what they call the fifth world.

83
00:03:36.201 --> 00:03:37.702
It's a world where there's going to be

84
00:03:37.702 --> 00:03:41.840
fusion of polarities where all is going to be accepted

85
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.375
which means we can no longer separate ourselves

86
00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:46.344
between me and you.

87
00:03:46.344 --> 00:03:48.280
I am gonna feel the effect of my actions

88
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.548
on you immediately,

89
00:03:50.548 --> 00:03:53.417
and not from a place of guilt but of a case of

90
00:03:53.417 --> 00:03:56.488
well, if I do that to you it affects me.

91
00:03:56.488 --> 00:04:00.675
That familiarity is being our separation.

92
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.527
<v Voiceover>Yes, and that's referring back to that</v>

93
00:04:03.527 --> 00:04:07.031
part of the passage that most people will find

94
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:11.770
comfort still in spite of the opportunity and the familiar.

95
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.338
<v ->And in the field of separation.</v>

96
00:04:13.338 --> 00:04:14.239
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

97
00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.041
<v ->Separation between them and somebody else</v>

98
00:04:17.041 --> 00:04:18.209
or them and their god.

99
00:04:19.778 --> 00:04:22.112
I think the last 2,000 years of the Piscean Age

100
00:04:22.112 --> 00:04:25.383
have been probably the most separative worlds

101
00:04:25.383 --> 00:04:27.061
that we've ever had.

102
00:04:27.061 --> 00:04:30.355
And we've projected our stuff our on the world

103
00:04:30.355 --> 00:04:32.990
and then gone to war against it.

104
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.525
<v Voiceover>And when you talk about 2012</v>

105
00:04:34.525 --> 00:04:37.129
you're not talking about that particular date.

106
00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:42.129
But again, as you were told in this beautiful experience,

107
00:04:42.634 --> 00:04:44.736
this is a period that lasts almost 40 years,

108
00:04:44.736 --> 00:04:46.470
36 years as I recall, right?

109
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.505
<v ->That's right.</v>

110
00:04:47.505 --> 00:04:49.474
<v Voiceover>And it started in the 1980s</v>

111
00:04:49.474 --> 00:04:52.577
and it culminates in the 2020s.

112
00:04:52.577 --> 00:04:54.078
And we're somewhere along there,

113
00:04:54.078 --> 00:04:55.713
we're more toward the latter half.

114
00:04:55.713 --> 00:04:57.715
And indeed I think if almost anybody

115
00:04:57.715 --> 00:04:59.650
looks back at the last 20 years

116
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.654
you can see changes of every kind in every way.

117
00:05:02.654 --> 00:05:07.654
Nonetheless we tend to hold on to our version of that

118
00:05:08.326 --> 00:05:10.328
as though we're hanging on for dear life.

119
00:05:10.328 --> 00:05:11.830
But let's talk about what was meant.

120
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.265
What started happening in the 1980s

121
00:05:14.265 --> 00:05:15.599
that you observed?

122
00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:18.336
<v ->So from an astronomical point of view</v>

123
00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:21.572
what we feel is the sun started its passage

124
00:05:21.572 --> 00:05:23.807
across the front of the galaxy.

125
00:05:23.807 --> 00:05:26.259
And according to the Maya we can see it ourselves

126
00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.013
if you look up on a really clear night

127
00:05:28.013 --> 00:05:29.981
where there's no other lights around,

128
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:32.784
you get the opportunity to see the dark rift,

129
00:05:32.784 --> 00:05:34.519
and that's interstellar dust.

130
00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:36.023
And it looks like a road,

131
00:05:36.023 --> 00:05:37.889
so they called it the Black Road.

132
00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.091
And the Mayas see that Black Road is heading

133
00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:42.593
straight into the galactic center

134
00:05:42.593 --> 00:05:45.029
and that we are heading along that black road.

135
00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:49.403
We've been on it now certainly since the 1980s.

136
00:05:49.403 --> 00:05:51.902
For many cultures they see the Milky Way

137
00:05:51.902 --> 00:05:53.170
as the Great Mother,

138
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.374
and so they see that Black Road as a vagina,

139
00:05:55.374 --> 00:05:57.241
so we are heading in.

140
00:05:57.241 --> 00:06:00.077
Or if you want to see it as the mouth of the great serpent,

141
00:06:00.077 --> 00:06:01.645
the same idea you're being swallowed

142
00:06:01.645 --> 00:06:04.283
by the great serpent or the great jaguar.

143
00:06:04.283 --> 00:06:06.550
And from that period of the 1980s,

144
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.553
and I have to say this in variability but

145
00:06:08.553 --> 00:06:10.722
we all know that there was the Harmonic Convergence

146
00:06:10.722 --> 00:06:14.926
in 1987 where it was said that 144,000 light beings

147
00:06:14.926 --> 00:06:18.729
woke up and people after said, "Is it me?"

148
00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:20.898
And of course, it was not--

149
00:06:20.898 --> 00:06:22.400
<v Voiceover>It got some notions going.</v>

150
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.268
<v ->It did.</v>

151
00:06:23.268 --> 00:06:25.503
Everybody wanted it to be me.

152
00:06:25.503 --> 00:06:28.906
To me it was much more that the 12 chakras woke up,

153
00:06:28.906 --> 00:06:31.443
and the 12 bodies of the 12 chakras woke up

154
00:06:31.443 --> 00:06:33.777
creating a 144 light beings.

155
00:06:33.777 --> 00:06:37.749
So we went from a seven dimension to a 12 dimension

156
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:40.753
and we have all been expanding to that 12th dimension

157
00:06:40.753 --> 00:06:42.420
ever since.

158
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.656
And I think that we then see is the speeding up

159
00:06:45.656 --> 00:06:48.993
taking place at the rate of the golden means.

160
00:06:48.993 --> 00:06:51.829
So everything gets divided by 0.618.

161
00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:54.965
So the speeding up hasn't just been yearly

162
00:06:54.965 --> 00:06:55.969
as we're all saying.

163
00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:58.169
<v Voiceover>No, it's exponential.</v>

164
00:06:58.169 --> 00:06:59.671
<v ->I'm always saying you shouldn't have thrown</v>

165
00:06:59.671 --> 00:07:02.140
your Christmas tree out because you need it tomorrow.

166
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.275
Don't get rid of anything.

167
00:07:04.275 --> 00:07:07.177
What I feel that 2012 represents is this birth

168
00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:09.646
of this new world according to the Maya.

169
00:07:09.646 --> 00:07:12.116
But it's like the dark moon.

170
00:07:12.116 --> 00:07:15.420
The day that we see the last slither of the old moon

171
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.021
we then have this period of darkness

172
00:07:17.021 --> 00:07:18.522
when we don't see a moon.

173
00:07:18.522 --> 00:07:20.724
And to me that birth is happening

174
00:07:20.724 --> 00:07:22.226
in the middle of that dark moon.

175
00:07:22.226 --> 00:07:24.061
<v Voiceover>As represented by the three nights of darkness.</v>

176
00:07:24.061 --> 00:07:24.828
<v ->There we go.</v>

177
00:07:24.828 --> 00:07:28.032
And then a day and a half later

178
00:07:28.032 --> 00:07:29.633
you start the new moon.

179
00:07:29.633 --> 00:07:31.169
So three days of darkness

180
00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:32.803
and of course we're here now in Easter,

181
00:07:32.803 --> 00:07:35.873
we're talking about this, this is the same period of time.

182
00:07:35.873 --> 00:07:37.675
Except that Easter was put at the wrong place,

183
00:07:37.675 --> 00:07:39.109
it should've been at a new moon

184
00:07:39.109 --> 00:07:42.146
and then not to a full moon, a new another story,

185
00:07:42.146 --> 00:07:45.116
but we should be at this moment in time.

186
00:07:45.116 --> 00:07:46.584
<v Voiceover>It's Good Friday today.</v>

187
00:07:46.584 --> 00:07:48.419
<v ->Yes, it is Good Friday today.</v>

188
00:07:48.419 --> 00:07:49.987
<v Voiceover>And indeed it's been good.</v>

189
00:07:49.987 --> 00:07:53.124
<v ->Just been switched to Christianity wise to the wrong end.</v>

190
00:07:53.124 --> 00:07:55.926
But it is good and this will be similar to 2012

191
00:07:55.926 --> 00:07:57.528
which is the birth of a new.

192
00:07:57.528 --> 00:07:59.297
So it's going from death to rebirth

193
00:07:59.297 --> 00:08:01.932
which is what all of this was about.

194
00:08:01.932 --> 00:08:04.034
<v Voiceover>And yet humanity isn't really quite</v>

195
00:08:04.034 --> 00:08:06.705
prepared to take on the death part of it.

196
00:08:06.705 --> 00:08:08.372
<v ->Nope, I found, I've spoken to a lot of people</v>

197
00:08:08.372 --> 00:08:09.808
who say I do transformation.

198
00:08:09.808 --> 00:08:12.076
I say, "So you're into death?" they say no.

199
00:08:12.076 --> 00:08:15.746
"I don't do death, I just do fresh, new birth."

200
00:08:15.746 --> 00:08:18.282
And it feels like they just want to go back,

201
00:08:18.282 --> 00:08:20.285
the caterpillar-butterfly, caterpillar-butterfly.

202
00:08:20.285 --> 00:08:22.353
They don't wanna do the cocoon.

203
00:08:22.353 --> 00:08:24.455
And the cocoon is essential.

204
00:08:24.455 --> 00:08:26.524
I mean, we all know that you have to break down

205
00:08:26.524 --> 00:08:28.960
the structure in order to create a new.

206
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.061
And I'm watching that happening as

207
00:08:31.061 --> 00:08:34.732
this alignment that we've been also watching

208
00:08:34.732 --> 00:08:37.034
which is Pluto going into Capricorn.

209
00:08:37.034 --> 00:08:40.538
That happened beginning of last year which is 2008

210
00:08:40.538 --> 00:08:43.641
and then back again in October 2008

211
00:08:43.641 --> 00:08:47.045
and it's gonna go on to 2023 where Pluto

212
00:08:47.045 --> 00:08:49.814
the planet of transformation, death, rebirth

213
00:08:49.814 --> 00:08:53.217
is going through Capricorn, the sign of structure and rules

214
00:08:53.217 --> 00:08:54.785
and beliefs.

215
00:08:54.785 --> 00:08:57.588
And I'm watching, myself included,

216
00:08:57.588 --> 00:09:00.491
everybody being taken down into their own underwold

217
00:09:00.491 --> 00:09:05.491
to face that which they have preferred to avoid

218
00:09:05.763 --> 00:09:08.065
so that they can die to the old.

219
00:09:08.065 --> 00:09:09.502
So we're having to die to the old

220
00:09:09.502 --> 00:09:12.203
to go into this underworld to meet ourselves

221
00:09:12.203 --> 00:09:14.071
so that we can be reborn.

222
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:15.172
<v Voiceover>What happens when you decide</v>

223
00:09:15.172 --> 00:09:16.374
"I don't want to do that.

224
00:09:16.374 --> 00:09:19.711
"I don't want pain, I don't want inconvenience.

225
00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:22.748
"I will continue to do the things I like doing."

226
00:09:22.748 --> 00:09:25.917
I'm going to maybe dance or take drugs

227
00:09:25.917 --> 00:09:29.053
or go out and drink cocktails with my friends or whatnot.

228
00:09:29.053 --> 00:09:30.087
What happens then?

229
00:09:30.087 --> 00:09:32.439
<v Voiceover>Have you met Pluto recently? (laughs)</v>

230
00:09:35.926 --> 00:09:37.762
Just to let you know that Pluto also

231
00:09:37.762 --> 00:09:40.465
is not masculine, it's feminine.

232
00:09:40.465 --> 00:09:42.734
It was only during the Greek and Roman times

233
00:09:42.734 --> 00:09:46.638
that they actually put a God in the underworld.

234
00:09:46.638 --> 00:09:49.039
Prior to that it was every other culture

235
00:09:49.039 --> 00:09:51.109
has the goddess in the underworld,

236
00:09:51.109 --> 00:09:52.443
big, dark crone.

237
00:09:52.443 --> 00:09:54.613
And the word "pluto" actually comes from "Plutonius"

238
00:09:54.613 --> 00:09:56.414
which means a gem.

239
00:09:56.414 --> 00:10:00.084
And so what she's saying is I am the repository.

240
00:10:00.084 --> 00:10:02.186
I hold your gems.

241
00:10:02.186 --> 00:10:04.722
You have to come down here to get them.

242
00:10:04.722 --> 00:10:07.291
And the gems are our consciousness.

243
00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:09.359
<v Voiceover>So if you're covering it up with cocktails</v>

244
00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:11.863
and cosmopolitans with the girl friends

245
00:10:11.863 --> 00:10:14.531
highly unlikely she's coming to come to you.

246
00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:16.367
But she will make you uncomfortable.

247
00:10:16.367 --> 00:10:18.335
<v ->Oh she will make you extremely uncomfortable.</v>

248
00:10:18.335 --> 00:10:19.870
<v Voiceover>If you choose not to do this journey.</v>

249
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.105
Let's talk about what that looks like

250
00:10:21.105 --> 00:10:22.239
and what you see around you.

251
00:10:22.239 --> 00:10:23.974
<v ->And the biggest challenge is our beliefs.</v>

252
00:10:23.974 --> 00:10:26.679
I mean, truly I'm watching any of us,

253
00:10:26.679 --> 00:10:29.579
and again I don't ever exclude myself from this,

254
00:10:29.579 --> 00:10:32.349
but my belief or anybody's belief

255
00:10:32.349 --> 00:10:34.818
is a part of a Capricorn structure.

256
00:10:34.818 --> 00:10:37.722
So, "Oh look how much I'm doing for humanity."

257
00:10:37.722 --> 00:10:40.991
Pluto says, "We've got some different plans."

258
00:10:40.991 --> 00:10:45.662
And really as I'm in my work of helping people

259
00:10:45.662 --> 00:10:47.464
I'm watching people suffer.

260
00:10:47.464 --> 00:10:49.133
I mean whether it's the loss of their jobs

261
00:10:49.133 --> 00:10:50.567
or loss of their homes

262
00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:53.004
but in some ways that's material.

263
00:10:53.004 --> 00:10:55.306
It's when you have nothing to believe in,

264
00:10:55.306 --> 00:10:57.541
when your beliefs are being shattered.

265
00:10:57.541 --> 00:10:59.443
And we go, "Hang on."

266
00:10:59.443 --> 00:11:02.813
And what she says is I will strip the meat

267
00:11:02.813 --> 00:11:05.515
from your story until we get down to the gems.

268
00:11:05.515 --> 00:11:10.088
And I don't care that you try and hang on to that story

269
00:11:10.088 --> 00:11:12.990
because she is the great vulture who's gonna strip it away.

270
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.226
And you may feel, "I'm unloved"

271
00:11:15.226 --> 00:11:18.029
or "God doesn't love me," or "I've done something wrong."

272
00:11:18.029 --> 00:11:19.363
And what I've heard from the Great Mother

273
00:11:19.363 --> 00:11:21.166
is she's saying is, "No, you don't even know

274
00:11:21.166 --> 00:11:22.899
"how much I love you.

275
00:11:22.899 --> 00:11:25.369
"I"m doing this because I love you."

276
00:11:25.369 --> 00:11:27.973
And it's that love that she said I will not be

277
00:11:27.973 --> 00:11:30.107
less than you are.

278
00:11:30.107 --> 00:11:32.209
<v Voiceover>And this applies to every ascention</v>

279
00:11:32.209 --> 00:11:34.644
being on this planet?

280
00:11:34.644 --> 00:11:35.912
<v ->We're in the middle.</v>

281
00:11:35.912 --> 00:11:38.082
We just say we're just around Easter at this time

282
00:11:38.082 --> 00:11:39.951
but we've been through winter.

283
00:11:39.951 --> 00:11:43.487
And you don't see a planet going, "Oh my leaves! My leaves!

284
00:11:43.487 --> 00:11:46.323
"Can I stick them back on again?"

285
00:11:46.323 --> 00:11:47.991
Nature kingdoms understand it

286
00:11:47.991 --> 00:11:50.294
like the moon cycle understands it.

287
00:11:50.294 --> 00:11:51.995
But human beings think that they can live

288
00:11:51.995 --> 00:11:56.133
in a 24-7 world and nothing ever has to shift.

289
00:11:56.133 --> 00:11:57.734
<v Voiceover>But what really has to be in place</v>

290
00:11:57.734 --> 00:12:01.639
is a clearer understanding of what lies on the other side.

291
00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:04.174
And that's what's missing from the stories

292
00:12:04.174 --> 00:12:06.577
because so far we have very limited ideas

293
00:12:06.577 --> 00:12:09.513
of what death brings into a life.

294
00:12:09.513 --> 00:12:12.816
Historically we're looking at a finality in a lot of cases,

295
00:12:12.816 --> 00:12:14.284
dust to dust.

296
00:12:14.284 --> 00:12:18.857
We're looking at a fairly tale and others.

297
00:12:18.857 --> 00:12:21.926
And without the grounding of understanding

298
00:12:21.926 --> 00:12:25.163
what's possible by reaching down into our selves,

299
00:12:25.163 --> 00:12:27.464
isn't it hard to have the motivation

300
00:12:27.464 --> 00:12:31.835
to go through the pain, the introspection necessary?

301
00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:33.137
<v ->I would agree.</v>

302
00:12:33.137 --> 00:12:34.472
I'm just feeling about my own,

303
00:12:34.472 --> 00:12:36.041
the people who have died in my life,

304
00:12:36.041 --> 00:12:38.008
I've had a lot of deaths in my life

305
00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:41.478
and I just know I would not be where I am now consciously

306
00:12:41.478 --> 00:12:43.514
had it not been for those people dying.

307
00:12:43.514 --> 00:12:44.281
Now, did I miss them?

308
00:12:44.281 --> 00:12:45.148
Absolutely.

309
00:12:45.148 --> 00:12:45.851
Did I grieve?

310
00:12:45.851 --> 00:12:47.351
Absolutely.

311
00:12:47.351 --> 00:12:49.253
But the fact is for instance when my father died

312
00:12:49.253 --> 00:12:50.922
when I was relatively young,

313
00:12:50.922 --> 00:12:54.258
if he had stayed alive I would not have had the courage

314
00:12:54.258 --> 00:12:56.293
to step out as I did.

315
00:12:56.293 --> 00:12:59.362
Had my mother not died when she chose to

316
00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:01.666
I would not be here in America.

317
00:13:01.666 --> 00:13:04.635
Now I see that again from my own psychic abilities

318
00:13:04.635 --> 00:13:07.405
working with people that many a time

319
00:13:07.405 --> 00:13:09.775
we would not be where we were now

320
00:13:09.775 --> 00:13:12.209
had it not been for a situation.

321
00:13:12.209 --> 00:13:14.045
And of course having worked with medicine

322
00:13:14.045 --> 00:13:16.747
now for 30 years people would tell me

323
00:13:16.747 --> 00:13:20.284
that illness took me in to a new place.

324
00:13:20.284 --> 00:13:22.520
Our challenge is grief.

325
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.024
But grief is a healthy way of dissolving the old story

326
00:13:27.024 --> 00:13:30.094
in order for us to experience a new one.

327
00:13:30.094 --> 00:13:32.797
And we need to go through grief.

328
00:13:32.797 --> 00:13:35.699
And I feel that people talk about the planetary changes.

329
00:13:35.699 --> 00:13:38.802
For instance like floods and earthquakes and volcanoes,

330
00:13:38.802 --> 00:13:41.104
but they're all the qualities of grief.

331
00:13:41.104 --> 00:13:42.439
Water, fire, earth.

332
00:13:42.439 --> 00:13:45.810
We need to go through those in order to actually

333
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:47.378
move in to another space.

334
00:13:47.378 --> 00:13:48.746
So no I'm not gonna promise anybody

335
00:13:48.746 --> 00:13:50.281
but there's gonna be a better world

336
00:13:50.281 --> 00:13:52.516
but there's nobody who would be listening,

337
00:13:52.516 --> 00:13:54.018
who would not be thinking, yeah,

338
00:13:54.018 --> 00:13:57.256
that situation, however hard it was at that time

339
00:13:57.256 --> 00:14:00.191
took me to a place that I wouldn't have gone otherwise.

340
00:14:00.191 --> 00:14:02.793
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about nephology</v>

341
00:14:02.793 --> 00:14:07.098
because there have been poems and legends

342
00:14:07.098 --> 00:14:11.134
and music and glyphs of all sorts from times past

343
00:14:11.134 --> 00:14:15.005
to these apop periods of history for us today

344
00:14:15.005 --> 00:14:16.740
to look at and to be,

345
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.509
and to gather some wisdom from.

346
00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:20.077
And a lot of these myths, as you say,

347
00:14:20.077 --> 00:14:22.613
until relatively recently were definitely

348
00:14:22.613 --> 00:14:24.615
matriarchaly centered, right?

349
00:14:24.615 --> 00:14:25.617
<v ->Patriacharly?</v>

350
00:14:25.617 --> 00:14:26.717
<v Voiceover>Matriarchaly.</v>

351
00:14:26.717 --> 00:14:28.152
(crosstalk)

352
00:14:28.152 --> 00:14:30.787
Yeah, until the patriot started coming in.

353
00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:34.191
Can you talk about some of what's been left behind

354
00:14:34.191 --> 00:14:35.959
for us in our understanding because this book

355
00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:39.897
is very oriented toward understanding the dark goddess even,

356
00:14:39.897 --> 00:14:43.500
I mean the elements of the feminine that have a

357
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.686
destructive element to it.

358
00:14:46.637 --> 00:14:49.072
Let's begin that part of the conversation

359
00:14:49.072 --> 00:14:51.242
because this is a big part of the book.

360
00:14:51.242 --> 00:14:53.610
<v ->I may not necessarily go in to the destructive right away.</v>

361
00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:54.545
<v Voiceover>Yeah, no, that's okay.</v>

362
00:14:54.545 --> 00:14:55.446
Just the triple goddess.

363
00:14:55.446 --> 00:14:59.316
<v ->I want to say that the balance between a male and female</v>

364
00:14:59.316 --> 00:15:02.854
has to now be, there needs to be a sacred marriage.

365
00:15:02.854 --> 00:15:04.922
And the way I see it is that the mail

366
00:15:04.922 --> 00:15:08.326
has his journey, what we call the hero's journey.

367
00:15:08.326 --> 00:15:12.195
But he always does that through the vehicle of the feminine.

368
00:15:12.195 --> 00:15:16.434
And he cannot journey through this period

369
00:15:16.434 --> 00:15:18.102
of transformation without the feminine.

370
00:15:18.102 --> 00:15:19.703
if you think of it birth has always been

371
00:15:19.703 --> 00:15:22.306
a quality of the feminine as is death.

372
00:15:22.306 --> 00:15:26.042
Every woman has experienced menses

373
00:15:26.042 --> 00:15:28.212
and gone through cycles of birth and death

374
00:15:28.212 --> 00:15:30.547
which she understands that it's more difficult

375
00:15:30.547 --> 00:15:33.151
from a masculine side to understand.

376
00:15:33.151 --> 00:15:36.187
So my masculine loves journeying, doing things,

377
00:15:36.187 --> 00:15:38.589
but it's the feminine now that has to come

378
00:15:38.589 --> 00:15:40.629
into play for us to go through this

379
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:42.893
tremendous time of transformation.

380
00:15:42.893 --> 00:15:45.662
And there are the three qualities of the triple goddess.

381
00:15:45.662 --> 00:15:48.565
The Great Mother, why we relate to her is, again,

382
00:15:48.565 --> 00:15:50.735
because the Maya believe that the Milky Way

383
00:15:50.735 --> 00:15:54.038
is the Great Mother and that we are facing at the moment

384
00:15:54.038 --> 00:15:56.707
the heart of the Great Mother which is the center.

385
00:15:56.707 --> 00:15:59.776
So it's really saying we need to get to the heart of her

386
00:15:59.776 --> 00:16:02.612
and we do it through her three faces.

387
00:16:02.612 --> 00:16:03.847
The first face is the virgin,

388
00:16:03.847 --> 00:16:06.585
the second the mother, and third the crone.

389
00:16:06.585 --> 00:16:10.254
And the virgin is the part which we recall

390
00:16:10.254 --> 00:16:11.889
a creative part of us.

391
00:16:11.889 --> 00:16:15.358
I like to think of her as our intuition.

392
00:16:15.358 --> 00:16:16.594
She often will come through,

393
00:16:16.594 --> 00:16:21.464
her significance was in Athena who as many people know.

394
00:16:21.464 --> 00:16:24.468
But Athena was actually a much older goddess

395
00:16:24.468 --> 00:16:26.170
called Pallas Athena.

396
00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.439
And Pallas Athena, like all the great goddesses

397
00:16:28.439 --> 00:16:31.074
always arose from out of the waters.

398
00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:34.177
The story goes that when she went into the patriarchy

399
00:16:34.177 --> 00:16:37.247
she realized that intuition which is what she carries

400
00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:39.682
from the heart would not survive.

401
00:16:39.682 --> 00:16:43.287
So she became swallowed, over swallowed within her mother

402
00:16:43.287 --> 00:16:45.456
and she gives her father Zeus a headache

403
00:16:45.456 --> 00:16:46.924
and they chop off the top of his head

404
00:16:46.924 --> 00:16:51.595
and out comes Athena fully armored over her heart.

405
00:16:51.595 --> 00:16:54.431
And now wisdom is always seen in the head.

406
00:16:54.431 --> 00:16:57.367
And I think that's the symbolism that a lot of us

407
00:16:57.367 --> 00:17:00.070
both as men and women are coming back to trusting

408
00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.607
our intuition at the virgin, through our heart.

409
00:17:03.607 --> 00:17:06.443
And I just want to say something that surprised me

410
00:17:06.443 --> 00:17:09.479
that the word virgin actually means to be complete

411
00:17:09.479 --> 00:17:11.915
unto yourself without the need for another

412
00:17:11.915 --> 00:17:13.750
to make you whole.

413
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:15.219
And I thought, wow, what would that be like

414
00:17:15.219 --> 00:17:18.555
if every child that came on to this planet was told

415
00:17:18.555 --> 00:17:20.791
"you are welcome as a unique individual

416
00:17:20.791 --> 00:17:23.593
"that doesn't need another person to make you whole."

417
00:17:23.593 --> 00:17:24.828
<v Voiceover>Yes, absolutely.</v>

418
00:17:24.828 --> 00:17:25.629
<v ->What a difference that would be.</v>

419
00:17:25.629 --> 00:17:26.529
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

420
00:17:26.529 --> 00:17:29.165
But unfortunately the mother, which we get to next,

421
00:17:29.165 --> 00:17:31.969
often gives a very different signal to the child

422
00:17:31.969 --> 00:17:34.838
and their own need to be needed on an emotional level

423
00:17:34.838 --> 00:17:35.939
on our plane.

424
00:17:35.939 --> 00:17:38.742
Let's talk about what the mother and the goddess

425
00:17:38.742 --> 00:17:40.644
realm is actually like.

426
00:17:40.644 --> 00:17:41.845
<v ->The mother and the goddess role,</v>

427
00:17:41.845 --> 00:17:44.347
she probably is the one that's got most of the press,

428
00:17:44.347 --> 00:17:45.048
doesn't she?

429
00:17:45.048 --> 00:17:47.351
If people look at the feminine it'd be Mother Mary

430
00:17:47.351 --> 00:17:49.686
or the mother image, the Dimitri character,

431
00:17:49.686 --> 00:17:51.555
the Isis character.

432
00:17:51.555 --> 00:17:54.858
But interestingly not only does she give us nurturing,

433
00:17:54.858 --> 00:17:56.393
that's what everybody knows of her,

434
00:17:56.393 --> 00:17:57.995
Her Abundance.

435
00:17:57.995 --> 00:18:00.498
And this is a time for abundance.

436
00:18:00.498 --> 00:18:03.229
But she also carries the cornocopia.

437
00:18:03.229 --> 00:18:05.702
She carries the harvest.

438
00:18:05.702 --> 00:18:07.804
And once I looked at that I thought, "That's interesting."

439
00:18:07.804 --> 00:18:10.240
She's not just saying I'll create this but

440
00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.145
you've also got harvest.

441
00:18:12.145 --> 00:18:15.378
And that makes me realize that I need to use

442
00:18:15.378 --> 00:18:19.350
the mother quality to eat the fruits of my endeavors,

443
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.584
to enjoy what I do.

444
00:18:21.584 --> 00:18:23.654
And I'm not always good at that.

445
00:18:23.654 --> 00:18:27.458
I'm really good at creating but I don't always

446
00:18:27.458 --> 00:18:30.327
take the time to stop to be nurtured

447
00:18:30.327 --> 00:18:32.632
by my creations.

448
00:18:32.632 --> 00:18:34.899
And to me that's a really important part,

449
00:18:34.899 --> 00:18:38.368
this balance that the mother asks for us,

450
00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:41.237
time to work and time to play.

451
00:18:41.237 --> 00:18:44.509
And she's saying if we come from a place of poverty

452
00:18:44.509 --> 00:18:47.311
we always are working because we have such a fear

453
00:18:47.311 --> 00:18:49.279
of taking time out.

454
00:18:49.279 --> 00:18:51.982
And she's saying the more time you take out

455
00:18:51.982 --> 00:18:53.917
the more abundance will come.

456
00:18:53.917 --> 00:18:55.485
<v Voiceover>That's such an important message</v>

457
00:18:55.485 --> 00:18:57.888
certainly in Western culture we don't get that.

458
00:18:57.888 --> 00:19:00.557
I think the Eastern cultures at least certainly spending

459
00:19:00.557 --> 00:19:03.560
time in India they seem to understand innately

460
00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.429
the value of having time.

461
00:19:05.429 --> 00:19:06.363
<v ->Yes.</v>

462
00:19:06.363 --> 00:19:07.864
<v Voiceover>And we've forgotten.</v>

463
00:19:07.864 --> 00:19:10.767
<v ->Yeah, I often relate it to the heart because</v>

464
00:19:10.767 --> 00:19:13.536
the outer vessels, the blood vessels of the heart,

465
00:19:13.536 --> 00:19:16.507
would I relate to the mother quality

466
00:19:16.507 --> 00:19:18.143
they're the coronary blood vessels.

467
00:19:18.143 --> 00:19:20.444
And interestingly the heart itself only ever gets

468
00:19:20.444 --> 00:19:24.414
fed during the relaxation phase called diastole.

469
00:19:24.414 --> 00:19:26.317
Isn't that interesting?

470
00:19:26.317 --> 00:19:28.719
Our increase in heart disease

471
00:19:28.719 --> 00:19:31.989
is because nobody's taking time out to relax.

472
00:19:31.989 --> 00:19:35.059
<v Voiceover>Yes, that's such an important point.</v>

473
00:19:35.059 --> 00:19:37.927
I hope everybody has a pencil out right now

474
00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:40.763
sketching it anywhere even on the palm of their hand.

475
00:19:40.763 --> 00:19:42.198
This is really critical to us.

476
00:19:42.198 --> 00:19:44.668
Otherwise how do you have time to reflect even

477
00:19:44.668 --> 00:19:46.503
and use the other virginal part.

478
00:19:46.503 --> 00:19:48.405
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>

479
00:19:48.405 --> 00:19:51.108
I just like to say to men that the erection

480
00:19:51.108 --> 00:19:53.910
is also caused during relaxation.

481
00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:56.479
And our whole increase in drugs,

482
00:19:56.479 --> 00:20:00.717
performance would actually not be needed

483
00:20:00.717 --> 00:20:04.053
if every man realize that actually his performance abilities

484
00:20:04.053 --> 00:20:06.857
are increased during the relaxation phase.

485
00:20:06.857 --> 00:20:08.759
<v Voiceover>Thus, the vacation to Hawaii.</v>

486
00:20:08.759 --> 00:20:09.459
<v ->It is.</v>

487
00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:10.827
(laughter)

488
00:20:10.827 --> 00:20:13.096
Parasympathetic.

489
00:20:13.096 --> 00:20:14.064
<v Voiceover>But still this would be something</v>

490
00:20:14.064 --> 00:20:16.566
that is innate part of our lives everyday.

491
00:20:16.566 --> 00:20:19.303
This period, the downtime, as it were,

492
00:20:19.303 --> 00:20:22.372
to rest and enjoy the fruits of our labors.

493
00:20:22.372 --> 00:20:23.907
<v ->Yes, and that's so hard.</v>

494
00:20:23.907 --> 00:20:27.043
I meet so many people and I go,

495
00:20:27.043 --> 00:20:29.146
"How do you celebrate what you've done?"

496
00:20:29.146 --> 00:20:30.547
"Oh I don't."

497
00:20:30.547 --> 00:20:32.750
Because they've been told it's big-headed,

498
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:35.719
it's not that important, anybody could've done it.

499
00:20:35.719 --> 00:20:37.355
<v Voiceover>Or afraid if you take your eye off the ball</v>

500
00:20:37.355 --> 00:20:38.989
it'll go away.

501
00:20:38.989 --> 00:20:40.190
<v ->And that's the ego.</v>

502
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:43.559
And want to just say that the ability to celebrate

503
00:20:43.559 --> 00:20:47.464
what you've done is the ego, not something

504
00:20:47.464 --> 00:20:48.865
that you should try and get rid of it

505
00:20:48.865 --> 00:20:52.269
literally is the marriage between the idea

506
00:20:52.269 --> 00:20:54.271
and the matter.

507
00:20:54.271 --> 00:20:56.123
The ego is "I did it."

508
00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.175
<v Voiceover>The genuine ego.</v>

509
00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:01.878
You need to have that for your own growth and survival.

510
00:21:01.878 --> 00:21:04.448
<v ->And that somebody, if they don't have an ego</v>

511
00:21:04.448 --> 00:21:07.484
you basically cannot do the whole cycle.

512
00:21:09.286 --> 00:21:11.487
Again, what the mother is saying is,

513
00:21:11.487 --> 00:21:14.358
"Feed yourself at harvest time because that's what's going

514
00:21:14.358 --> 00:21:15.942
"to get you through the winter."

515
00:21:17.461 --> 00:21:19.563
<v Voiceover>And I think just as I did a moment ago</v>

516
00:21:19.563 --> 00:21:22.365
that that word is often really misused

517
00:21:22.365 --> 00:21:26.302
when we're talking about an unhealthy fear or attachment

518
00:21:26.302 --> 00:21:28.672
and we're calling it ego.

519
00:21:28.672 --> 00:21:31.308
And I apologize for that 'cause that's actually inaccurate.

520
00:21:31.308 --> 00:21:35.345
But nonetheless, it is a fear, it is a fear

521
00:21:35.345 --> 00:21:37.981
that keeps us in that space of not allowing ourselves

522
00:21:37.981 --> 00:21:40.983
to celebrate and take the time for ourselves.

523
00:21:40.983 --> 00:21:43.721
So we get that one, I hope loud and clear.

524
00:21:44.888 --> 00:21:46.190
Are you finished with the mother?

525
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.157
Let's go to the crone?

526
00:21:47.157 --> 00:21:50.293
<v ->Yes, so the crone, I've started to talk about her.</v>

527
00:21:52.695 --> 00:21:54.731
If I come back to my virgin, the virgin

528
00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:57.168
carries the blueprint of what you're here to do,

529
00:21:57.168 --> 00:21:59.304
the completeness of yourself without the need

530
00:21:59.304 --> 00:22:00.738
for another to make you whole.

531
00:22:00.738 --> 00:22:03.641
So what I see it's like, before you came down here

532
00:22:03.641 --> 00:22:06.577
you created a jigsaw lid, all right,

533
00:22:06.577 --> 00:22:08.611
and then you came down here and you said,

534
00:22:08.611 --> 00:22:10.346
"I know what I'm gonna do down here."

535
00:22:10.346 --> 00:22:13.717
You come down here and you got 5,000 pieces

536
00:22:13.717 --> 00:22:15.969
and no jigsaw lid (laughs).

537
00:22:17.621 --> 00:22:19.990
And of course that's why we need our intuition.

538
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.075
It was like, "Now what was I gonna do (laughs)?"

539
00:22:23.193 --> 00:22:25.929
And so that jigsaw lid is often called

540
00:22:25.929 --> 00:22:28.965
the spiritual blueprint, the higher self,

541
00:22:28.965 --> 00:22:30.968
my guidance holds it.

542
00:22:30.968 --> 00:22:33.904
But it's that that we said, "I will come down

543
00:22:33.904 --> 00:22:36.406
"and bring heaven unto earth.

544
00:22:36.406 --> 00:22:37.807
"I will manifest it."

545
00:22:37.807 --> 00:22:39.809
And the only way we know what we're here for

546
00:22:39.809 --> 00:22:42.979
is through what we call intuition in a guidance,

547
00:22:42.979 --> 00:22:45.515
in a voice, in a wisdom, whatever.

548
00:22:45.515 --> 00:22:48.752
But it's the virgin, will be there tapping on your shoulder

549
00:22:48.752 --> 00:22:51.154
and saying, "I don't think those two bits go together."

550
00:22:51.154 --> 00:22:52.389
(laughter)

551
00:22:52.389 --> 00:22:54.287
And we go, "Yes, they do.

552
00:22:54.287 --> 00:22:56.626
"I can force them (laughs)."

553
00:22:56.626 --> 00:22:58.227
<v Voiceover>We all know what that feels like.</v>

554
00:22:58.227 --> 00:23:00.997
<v ->And then we even build a whole story around it (laughs).</v>

555
00:23:00.997 --> 00:23:02.765
<v Voiceover>Of why we had to do it that way.</v>

556
00:23:02.765 --> 00:23:05.134
<v ->And everybody else is going, "Are you sure?"</v>

557
00:23:05.134 --> 00:23:06.069
And we go, "Yes."

558
00:23:06.069 --> 00:23:07.537
(laughter)

559
00:23:07.537 --> 00:23:09.106
<v Voiceover>It could fit.</v>

560
00:23:09.106 --> 00:23:11.007
<v ->And I was thinking, I was a knitter,</v>

561
00:23:11.007 --> 00:23:13.009
I was a really bad knitter but I was a knitter,

562
00:23:13.009 --> 00:23:15.545
and you know if you did knit and you'd finished

563
00:23:15.545 --> 00:23:18.249
and then you saw this hole and you knew you dropped

564
00:23:18.249 --> 00:23:22.486
that stitch way back and it takes courage.

565
00:23:22.486 --> 00:23:24.988
It takes courage to take it off the needle

566
00:23:24.988 --> 00:23:28.291
and it take it all the way back to pick up that stitch.

567
00:23:28.291 --> 00:23:29.592
<v Voiceover>That's a good analogy.</v>

568
00:23:29.592 --> 00:23:31.094
<v ->And that to me is what we're doing.</v>

569
00:23:31.094 --> 00:23:32.996
So when I speak about, when you speak about,

570
00:23:32.996 --> 00:23:36.500
let's just stay on a superficial level,

571
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.735
we're just wanting to say it's all fine and say,

572
00:23:38.735 --> 00:23:42.405
"Everybody knows and we know that we dropped that stitch."

573
00:23:42.405 --> 00:23:44.008
<v Voiceover>Well if we didn't know society</v>

574
00:23:44.008 --> 00:23:45.776
and the crumbling of the institutions

575
00:23:45.776 --> 00:23:49.746
are certainly reflecting it back to us at this time.

576
00:23:49.746 --> 00:23:51.214
You talked about the crone a moment ago

577
00:23:51.214 --> 00:23:54.685
and it's interesting because certainly in the United States,

578
00:23:54.685 --> 00:23:58.054
I don't know how it is in England or the rest of the West,

579
00:23:58.054 --> 00:24:01.225
but that word has been associated with witch

580
00:24:01.225 --> 00:24:05.662
and ugliness and undesirability on every level.

581
00:24:05.662 --> 00:24:08.531
And there's a really, I'm sure as soon as you say crone,

582
00:24:08.531 --> 00:24:10.566
a lot of the females watching this are thinking,

583
00:24:10.566 --> 00:24:13.537
"Oh I don't want to be a crone."

584
00:24:13.537 --> 00:24:16.823
What is the mythology that happened there?

585
00:24:18.074 --> 00:24:20.443
<v ->I think of Carly of course who is having sex</v>

586
00:24:20.443 --> 00:24:22.946
as she eats the entrails of her husband.

587
00:24:22.946 --> 00:24:25.631
(laughter)

588
00:24:27.751 --> 00:24:29.151
Given PR people.

589
00:24:29.151 --> 00:24:30.520
<v Voiceover>There is a less attractive side to it</v>

590
00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.189
is what you're saying.

591
00:24:32.189 --> 00:24:34.991
<v ->She is about destruction, she is about destruction</v>

592
00:24:34.991 --> 00:24:37.660
and that is what people are so scared of.

593
00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.896
But she is also the outbreath.

594
00:24:39.896 --> 00:24:42.065
I see people saying, "I just do inbreaths,"

595
00:24:42.065 --> 00:24:46.870
because she is related to expiration; death outbreath.

596
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:48.137
<v Voiceover>When you say that even,</v>

597
00:24:48.137 --> 00:24:51.274
this is a little story, but every now and then

598
00:24:51.274 --> 00:24:53.442
I have to give myself an injection of Cortisol

599
00:24:53.442 --> 00:24:55.244
because I have this issue.

600
00:24:55.244 --> 00:24:57.481
And I'm in a weakened state, very weakened

601
00:24:57.481 --> 00:24:58.782
when I have to do that.

602
00:24:58.782 --> 00:25:03.187
And I had put all of my paraphernalia for this

603
00:25:03.187 --> 00:25:05.088
into a lunch box.

604
00:25:05.088 --> 00:25:08.391
I don't know why I never looked at the imagery,

605
00:25:08.391 --> 00:25:10.127
it was an image of colion.

606
00:25:10.127 --> 00:25:12.562
(laughter)

607
00:25:12.562 --> 00:25:16.600
And when it came time to use it it really took me down

608
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.269
into a very worsened state.

609
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:22.238
I eventually slathered another picture over it.

610
00:25:22.238 --> 00:25:23.606
I shoulda just thrown the lunch box out.

611
00:25:23.606 --> 00:25:25.542
But it was interesting because of that

612
00:25:25.542 --> 00:25:27.910
subconscious programming that it was actually

613
00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:31.114
taking me closer to a state of death quite literally.

614
00:25:31.114 --> 00:25:33.083
<v ->Exactly, exactly.</v>

615
00:25:33.083 --> 00:25:34.684
<v Voiceover>Just to see the imagery</v>

616
00:25:34.684 --> 00:25:36.620
and know what collie is.

617
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:38.621
<v ->Yes, exactly, exactly.</v>

618
00:25:38.621 --> 00:25:39.956
<v Voiceover>And we're afraid of that.</v>

619
00:25:39.956 --> 00:25:41.158
<v ->We are.</v>

620
00:25:41.158 --> 00:25:42.492
And as I said it's so ridiculous

621
00:25:42.492 --> 00:25:44.794
because we do it 18 times a minute;

622
00:25:44.794 --> 00:25:46.863
we breathe out, we die.

623
00:25:46.863 --> 00:25:49.633
But then cultures that have failed to understand

624
00:25:49.633 --> 00:25:51.434
the success.

625
00:25:51.434 --> 00:25:53.269
For instance, we tend to wear black,

626
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:55.271
other cultures wear white at death.

627
00:25:55.271 --> 00:25:57.674
The understanding that this is a new birth,

628
00:25:57.674 --> 00:25:59.742
the understanding of the movement.

629
00:25:59.742 --> 00:26:01.210
And of course a lot of that is beamed

630
00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:03.446
because people have changed their story

631
00:26:03.446 --> 00:26:05.815
about whether there are other lifes.

632
00:26:05.815 --> 00:26:08.051
<v Voiceover>Yes, this is a big component of it.</v>

633
00:26:08.051 --> 00:26:09.252
Do you care to talk about that?

634
00:26:09.252 --> 00:26:12.021
Because you really have done a lot of work personally,

635
00:26:12.021 --> 00:26:15.492
but you've come to understand the wheel

636
00:26:15.492 --> 00:26:19.896
of our complicity and the portrait

637
00:26:19.896 --> 00:26:22.632
of what we actually are at this time.

638
00:26:22.632 --> 00:26:24.134
With the parts, what we want to disown,

639
00:26:24.134 --> 00:26:25.401
are often the parts of ourselves

640
00:26:25.401 --> 00:26:28.705
that we may have experienced before, for example.

641
00:26:28.705 --> 00:26:32.575
<v ->And I speak to those who have no belief in past lives</v>

642
00:26:32.575 --> 00:26:34.478
and I bless you and love you for it.

643
00:26:34.478 --> 00:26:37.513
But I've worked too long now either as a doctor

644
00:26:37.513 --> 00:26:39.749
or even in psychology and thinking,

645
00:26:39.749 --> 00:26:42.084
"How can you make sense of this from the life

646
00:26:42.084 --> 00:26:44.019
"that this person has led?"

647
00:26:44.019 --> 00:26:48.892
And I feel that there's been some bad management

648
00:26:48.892 --> 00:26:50.960
where they have taken something that was very small

649
00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.663
to make it big in order to fit this story

650
00:26:53.663 --> 00:26:55.731
when you can't fit it to the story.

651
00:26:55.731 --> 00:26:59.001
So I say I don't mind if people don't believe in other lives

652
00:26:59.001 --> 00:27:00.237
and there's only one.

653
00:27:00.237 --> 00:27:02.873
But frankly, it's hard to explain an awful lot.

654
00:27:02.873 --> 00:27:06.109
And that it can do harm by not explaining that.

655
00:27:06.109 --> 00:27:08.913
I don't mind if we call it past and future lives.

656
00:27:08.913 --> 00:27:11.147
Again, I think we have as many future lives,

657
00:27:11.147 --> 00:27:14.151
or if we wanted to see them as lives in one

658
00:27:14.151 --> 00:27:17.970
around the center would be another way of looking at that.

659
00:27:19.522 --> 00:27:21.192
I'm gonna take it right out and just saying,

660
00:27:21.192 --> 00:27:25.895
I believe here we are as highly evolved eternal beings;

661
00:27:26.995 --> 00:27:30.633
making a choice to be in this particular life,

662
00:27:30.633 --> 00:27:34.604
this most amazing lives of 26,000 years, and we said,

663
00:27:34.604 --> 00:27:38.842
"I will go and finish my karma for the last 26,000 years."

664
00:27:38.842 --> 00:27:42.312
And that could be a thousand lifes, who knows, few lifes.

665
00:27:42.312 --> 00:27:45.648
But I'm coming down here and I'm gonna do all of that.

666
00:27:45.648 --> 00:27:47.984
And I can just imagine my guidance saying,

667
00:27:47.984 --> 00:27:48.851
"Are you sure?

668
00:27:48.851 --> 00:27:49.819
(laughter)

669
00:27:49.819 --> 00:27:50.955
"You're gonna do it all in one life?"

670
00:27:50.955 --> 00:27:52.722
And I went, "Easy."

671
00:27:52.722 --> 00:27:54.458
<v Voiceover>You're saying, "Oh my God, she's up.</v>

672
00:27:54.458 --> 00:27:55.458
"Let's get going."

673
00:27:55.458 --> 00:27:56.659
(laughter)

674
00:27:56.659 --> 00:27:58.362
<v ->'Cause they now forgot the lid and it was like,</v>

675
00:27:58.362 --> 00:28:00.730
"Excuse me, beam me up (laughs).

676
00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:02.565
"Can I have a lid?"

677
00:28:02.565 --> 00:28:04.233
So the idea that we came here,

678
00:28:05.702 --> 00:28:08.238
again I appreciate the people who do not believe

679
00:28:08.238 --> 00:28:09.939
that they chose their family or they chose

680
00:28:09.939 --> 00:28:12.442
when they were gonna be born or where.

681
00:28:12.442 --> 00:28:15.244
<v ->If you don't, God bless you for that.</v>

682
00:28:15.244 --> 00:28:18.915
I'm saying is, I don't think anybody ever made a mistake

683
00:28:18.915 --> 00:28:21.284
by the choices they made.

684
00:28:21.284 --> 00:28:21.984
<v Voiceover>I would agree with that.</v>

685
00:28:21.984 --> 00:28:23.387
<v ->Because if you're coming from a highly evolved place</v>

686
00:28:23.387 --> 00:28:25.388
you could not have made a mistake.

687
00:28:25.388 --> 00:28:27.089
Therefore, I don't deem that you could make a mistake

688
00:28:27.089 --> 00:28:28.658
about getting ill.

689
00:28:28.658 --> 00:28:30.160
I think you don't have some mistake as,

690
00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.360
"Wow, how did I get ill?"

691
00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.829
You chose a path.

692
00:28:33.829 --> 00:28:36.232
Coming from that, what we do is that we said,

693
00:28:36.232 --> 00:28:38.468
"I will bring my blueprint down onto earth

694
00:28:38.468 --> 00:28:42.405
"and I will create a world based on my blueprint."

695
00:28:42.405 --> 00:28:44.240
And what we do is we create something and we go,

696
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.842
"That's mine," we celebrate it and we love it,

697
00:28:46.842 --> 00:28:49.478
and we go, "I did that," and we own it.

698
00:28:49.478 --> 00:28:52.082
And then we go, "Who on earth did that (laughs)?"

699
00:28:52.082 --> 00:28:52.850
<v Voiceover>I didn't do that.</v>

700
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:54.684
<v ->I didn't do that (laughs).</v>

701
00:28:54.684 --> 00:28:56.286
Children learn that very early.

702
00:28:56.286 --> 00:28:58.454
It wasn't my fault (laughs).

703
00:28:58.454 --> 00:29:02.158
So we pick and choose which parts of our creation

704
00:29:02.158 --> 00:29:05.729
that we will own, take ownership of.

705
00:29:05.729 --> 00:29:09.499
The problem is that we now have bits of ourselves

706
00:29:09.499 --> 00:29:14.203
out in the ethos, out in the stories

707
00:29:14.203 --> 00:29:16.172
and we aren't taking ownership.

708
00:29:16.172 --> 00:29:19.341
So this life is a life for owning all the parts

709
00:29:19.341 --> 00:29:21.177
that become separated.

710
00:29:21.177 --> 00:29:24.815
Because if we don't, this is part of my light,

711
00:29:24.815 --> 00:29:27.219
so if I don't take ownership of that piece of my light

712
00:29:27.219 --> 00:29:30.252
I can never be a fully enlightened being.

713
00:29:30.252 --> 00:29:34.224
And to me that's every wise person, every master

714
00:29:34.224 --> 00:29:37.360
who took ownership of their pieces.

715
00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.596
And I see darkness, not ask something that's negative,

716
00:29:40.596 --> 00:29:43.733
I say it's that part of you that's still hidden to you,

717
00:29:43.733 --> 00:29:46.269
what you really meant was that part of me

718
00:29:46.269 --> 00:29:48.105
still in the shadows.

719
00:29:48.105 --> 00:29:51.841
What's happening now is that those pieces,

720
00:29:51.841 --> 00:29:54.344
if we don't own them they own us.

721
00:29:54.344 --> 00:29:56.478
So then people tell me a story, it's like,

722
00:29:56.478 --> 00:29:58.181
"Wow, these things happen to me,

723
00:29:58.181 --> 00:29:59.817
"why do they keep happening?"

724
00:29:59.817 --> 00:30:03.653
And I can see that they're trying to get your attention.

725
00:30:03.653 --> 00:30:06.956
And what we tend to want to do is just move them away

726
00:30:06.956 --> 00:30:08.524
and we go, "Whoa, it's happening a lot."

727
00:30:08.524 --> 00:30:09.725
It's like, yeah, they're really trying

728
00:30:09.725 --> 00:30:11.260
to get your attention.

729
00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.795
And the reason we don't want to own them

730
00:30:12.795 --> 00:30:17.600
is usually a shame, a fear, a fear for own power

731
00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:18.801
and unless--

732
00:30:18.801 --> 00:30:19.637
<v Voiceover>Fear of change.</v>

733
00:30:19.637 --> 00:30:20.904
<v ->Fear of change.</v>

734
00:30:20.904 --> 00:30:24.507
And unless we own them, we can never be whole.

735
00:30:24.507 --> 00:30:25.909
And what there is happening at the moment

736
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:29.179
they are coming at us now, they are showing up.

737
00:30:29.179 --> 00:30:33.316
Either in reflections from other people or through,

738
00:30:33.316 --> 00:30:36.019
I have to say, illness or through our own, unconscious,

739
00:30:36.019 --> 00:30:37.586
we're dreaming about them,

740
00:30:37.586 --> 00:30:39.655
"I have dreams of people chasing me,"

741
00:30:39.655 --> 00:30:41.123
it's like, "Yeah, that's part of you.

742
00:30:41.123 --> 00:30:42.591
"Don't let it catch you."

743
00:30:42.591 --> 00:30:45.962
And even in people who perhaps have always wanted

744
00:30:45.962 --> 00:30:49.799
to see only the good in people or the light,

745
00:30:49.799 --> 00:30:52.568
where if we have judgment of somebody else

746
00:30:52.568 --> 00:30:55.604
it's a part of us awaiting integration.

747
00:30:55.604 --> 00:30:57.707
So that when I might make a statement and saying,

748
00:30:57.707 --> 00:31:00.910
"I'm a good person," you're really referring

749
00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:03.280
that there's somebody else out there that's not.

750
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.482
Once we make that separation, we're talking

751
00:31:05.482 --> 00:31:08.518
about a part of ourselves we don't want to own.

752
00:31:08.518 --> 00:31:10.353
<v Voiceover>This is huge.</v>

753
00:31:10.353 --> 00:31:12.355
Because it's almost an uncomfortable aspect

754
00:31:12.355 --> 00:31:13.989
of introspection.

755
00:31:13.989 --> 00:31:15.224
<v ->Yes, it is.</v>

756
00:31:15.224 --> 00:31:17.660
And of course in this country especially,

757
00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.363
we're really good at pointing fingers.

758
00:31:20.363 --> 00:31:23.132
Those people over there are the evil ones,

759
00:31:23.132 --> 00:31:24.867
we're the good guys.

760
00:31:24.867 --> 00:31:27.236
That is what's gonna have to stop.

761
00:31:27.236 --> 00:31:31.274
<v Voiceover>'Cause collectively we have created all of it.</v>

762
00:31:31.274 --> 00:31:34.110
<v ->And anything that we judge in another person</v>

763
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:35.512
we are seeing ourselves.

764
00:31:35.512 --> 00:31:39.682
So if I have an emotional reaction to anything or anybody

765
00:31:39.682 --> 00:31:43.352
it's a part of me awaiting integration.

766
00:31:43.352 --> 00:31:46.288
We could all go to the same movie, we come out and I'd say,

767
00:31:46.288 --> 00:31:47.690
"God, did you see that person?"

768
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:49.627
And you'd say, "No, I didn't see that character.

769
00:31:49.627 --> 00:31:51.761
"I was so caught up in this character."

770
00:31:51.761 --> 00:31:54.797
We can only see what we already know.

771
00:31:54.797 --> 00:31:55.598
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

772
00:31:55.598 --> 00:31:58.067
<v ->So our perceptions will all be different.</v>

773
00:31:58.067 --> 00:32:00.336
So whenever I might have a passion for something,

774
00:32:00.336 --> 00:32:02.405
I want to help those who are poor,

775
00:32:02.405 --> 00:32:05.192
I have to say, "Where is the poor in me first."

776
00:32:06.075 --> 00:32:08.477
If I have an unfairness about this,

777
00:32:08.477 --> 00:32:11.247
I have to look at where's it's not fair for me.

778
00:32:11.247 --> 00:32:14.217
And if I heal me, I heal the world.

779
00:32:15.084 --> 00:32:17.319
It's a much quicker way than running around

780
00:32:17.319 --> 00:32:18.654
trying to do it in other way.

781
00:32:18.654 --> 00:32:19.423
<v Voiceover>It is, it is.</v>

782
00:32:19.423 --> 00:32:20.991
I mean, through the years I certainly find

783
00:32:20.991 --> 00:32:23.893
that I try to be much speedier in reacting.

784
00:32:23.893 --> 00:32:25.595
When these things knock on my door, it's like,

785
00:32:25.595 --> 00:32:27.196
"Okay, I'm not gonna fight you on that one.

786
00:32:27.196 --> 00:32:29.465
"We'll just flow with it."

787
00:32:29.465 --> 00:32:31.901
It saves you a lot of heartache, a lot of pain.

788
00:32:31.901 --> 00:32:35.438
<v ->I meet a lot of people who want to save the planet.</v>

789
00:32:35.438 --> 00:32:37.739
Well, we're walking around with it.

790
00:32:37.739 --> 00:32:40.276
We were given our own little planet to take care of.

791
00:32:40.276 --> 00:32:43.246
We have a tree which is our bronchi and our lungs,

792
00:32:43.246 --> 00:32:45.148
and we have bones which are our stones,

793
00:32:45.148 --> 00:32:47.883
and we have water which is our blood flow.

794
00:32:47.883 --> 00:32:50.786
Before we save the planet could we just have a relationship

795
00:32:50.786 --> 00:32:54.958
with our body which is earth, fire, air and water.

796
00:32:54.958 --> 00:32:56.860
Everything is in here.

797
00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:59.129
If we had a better relationship with our body

798
00:32:59.129 --> 00:33:00.496
the planet would respond.

799
00:33:00.496 --> 00:33:01.830
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

800
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:05.370
<v ->But while we look in the mirror and go, "Ahh."</v>

801
00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:08.171
Or we battle with our body, or we suffer from,

802
00:33:08.171 --> 00:33:10.907
or we struggle from, or we beat up on our body

803
00:33:10.907 --> 00:33:13.009
that's what will happen in the outer world.

804
00:33:13.009 --> 00:33:13.909
<v Voiceover>And that is what's happening</v>

805
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:14.844
in the outer world.

806
00:33:14.844 --> 00:33:16.479
<v ->And we look at the misuse of energy--</v>

807
00:33:16.479 --> 00:33:17.080
<v Voiceover>With the planet.</v>

808
00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.581
<v ->Then we misuse energy.</v>

809
00:33:18.581 --> 00:33:20.283
We do not feed our body in the way that would help.

810
00:33:20.283 --> 00:33:25.283
The body is literally a reflection and vice versa.

811
00:33:25.421 --> 00:33:27.089
<v Voiceover>Where does the masculine/feminine</v>

812
00:33:27.089 --> 00:33:30.025
come into play in this, just what you've been saying?

813
00:33:30.025 --> 00:33:31.928
<v ->In terms of our relationship with the body?</v>

814
00:33:31.928 --> 00:33:36.866
I think it's more a psyche that has stepped out

815
00:33:36.866 --> 00:33:40.836
of that journey that there's such an emphasis on doing

816
00:33:40.836 --> 00:33:41.770
and achieving.

817
00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:45.259
<v Voiceover>Which is the masculine way.</v>

818
00:33:46.642 --> 00:33:49.278
<v ->If I may, I can just say that there are two sides</v>

819
00:33:49.278 --> 00:33:50.847
of the masculine.

820
00:33:50.847 --> 00:33:53.449
The piece that we probably know the most, Joseph Campbell,

821
00:33:53.449 --> 00:33:55.084
and he did write about the other side,

822
00:33:55.084 --> 00:33:57.320
but people keep talking about "The Hero's Journey",

823
00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.756
"The Hero's Journey" is only the inbreath.

824
00:33:59.756 --> 00:34:02.925
So it's taking an idea, as the little boy child

825
00:34:02.925 --> 00:34:06.195
becoming the hero and becoming king.

826
00:34:06.195 --> 00:34:08.731
And especially in this country again

827
00:34:08.731 --> 00:34:10.699
and in other Western countries,

828
00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:13.368
this emphasis on the success of the hero.

829
00:34:13.368 --> 00:34:15.654
He did it with one leg, he did it without.

830
00:34:16.873 --> 00:34:19.208
They never talk about the second half.

831
00:34:19.208 --> 00:34:20.275
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about that.</v>

832
00:34:20.275 --> 00:34:23.746
<v ->Which is the king must die.</v>

833
00:34:23.746 --> 00:34:28.117
And we talked earlier about how the ancient mythologist

834
00:34:28.117 --> 00:34:31.253
such as Sumerian mythologist and more ancient

835
00:34:31.253 --> 00:34:34.189
all talked about the king must die.

836
00:34:34.189 --> 00:34:37.693
And the king dying is from the summer solstice

837
00:34:37.693 --> 00:34:39.896
around to the winter solstice.

838
00:34:39.896 --> 00:34:41.898
And at the winter solstice you have the birth

839
00:34:41.898 --> 00:34:43.266
of the new child.

840
00:34:43.266 --> 00:34:46.402
So every culture understood the dying king

841
00:34:46.402 --> 00:34:48.738
in order to give birth to the new.

842
00:34:48.738 --> 00:34:50.941
But many of our Western worlds

843
00:34:50.941 --> 00:34:52.441
have just cut off the second half.

844
00:34:52.441 --> 00:34:54.777
We don't do that part.

845
00:34:54.777 --> 00:34:55.611
<v Voiceover>Not gracefully.</v>

846
00:34:55.611 --> 00:34:56.345
<v ->Not gracefully.</v>

847
00:34:56.345 --> 00:34:58.614
If I may just share a couple of stories with you.

848
00:34:58.614 --> 00:34:59.949
<v Voiceover>Yes, please.</v>

849
00:34:59.949 --> 00:35:02.118
<v ->First of all of course, the Jesus story</v>

850
00:35:02.118 --> 00:35:04.019
was all based on that.

851
00:35:04.019 --> 00:35:08.524
That he knew that the crowning of him as king,

852
00:35:08.524 --> 00:35:11.844
he knew that signed his deathward.

853
00:35:13.362 --> 00:35:17.866
He knew he was following that story of the king must die.

854
00:35:17.866 --> 00:35:20.269
He was just enacting that.

855
00:35:20.269 --> 00:35:25.074
Stonehenge was set up to be particularly important

856
00:35:25.074 --> 00:35:29.178
during the summer solstice where there was a huge pillar,

857
00:35:29.178 --> 00:35:32.415
and basically it was at the time of recognizing

858
00:35:32.415 --> 00:35:35.551
that this was the ultimate of the king, the son,

859
00:35:35.551 --> 00:35:37.119
and now the son must die.

860
00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:39.088
So the ancient people understood that.

861
00:35:39.088 --> 00:35:41.090
Or you went to Newgrange in Ireland

862
00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:43.192
and that welcomed in a new sun

863
00:35:43.192 --> 00:35:44.593
in the time of the winter solstice.

864
00:35:44.593 --> 00:35:48.598
So most of these Celtic and druid understandings.

865
00:35:48.598 --> 00:35:50.567
And then there was a story of Perceval

866
00:35:50.567 --> 00:35:54.003
and the Perceval story where it came out of the 1200s,

867
00:35:54.003 --> 00:35:56.805
very much at the time where the feminine was quite strong

868
00:35:56.805 --> 00:35:59.642
and Perceval, if I may just tell the story,

869
00:35:59.642 --> 00:36:04.642
was a young boy whose father was a knight

870
00:36:05.551 --> 00:36:08.718
and the knight was killed and so his mother

871
00:36:08.718 --> 00:36:11.720
didn't want her son to ever die or to become a knight,

872
00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.022
so she took him into the deep, deep woods.

873
00:36:14.022 --> 00:36:16.795
And she brought him up in a very simple way,

874
00:36:16.795 --> 00:36:18.995
staying away from the city.

875
00:36:18.995 --> 00:36:20.864
And one day he's out hunting and of course

876
00:36:20.864 --> 00:36:23.833
he suddenly sees these three knights walk by

877
00:36:23.833 --> 00:36:25.869
and he's only ever heard of angels so he says,

878
00:36:25.869 --> 00:36:26.602
"You must be angels."

879
00:36:26.602 --> 00:36:28.604
And they say, "No, we're knights."

880
00:36:28.604 --> 00:36:30.606
Of course he's now seen them and he said,

881
00:36:30.606 --> 00:36:32.407
"That's it, I'm gonna become a knight."

882
00:36:32.407 --> 00:36:35.278
His mother is distraught and he says,

883
00:36:35.278 --> 00:36:36.612
"You can't stop me."

884
00:36:36.612 --> 00:36:41.050
And that's very symbolic of that as he steps fully

885
00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:44.586
into his light, which is the light of the new moon,

886
00:36:44.586 --> 00:36:48.157
she, the dark moon, must disappear.

887
00:36:48.157 --> 00:36:51.360
So there's often she dies at his expense of growth.

888
00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.863
Well of course Perceval goes off to the,

889
00:36:53.863 --> 00:36:57.166
probably the knight,

890
00:36:57.166 --> 00:37:00.969
King Arthur and his round table and his court.

891
00:37:00.969 --> 00:37:03.505
And of course he comes, he's very clumsy,

892
00:37:03.505 --> 00:37:05.140
and he's always asking questions and they all said,

893
00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:06.943
"Just stop asking questions.

894
00:37:06.943 --> 00:37:08.377
"That's your problem."

895
00:37:08.377 --> 00:37:11.246
So he grows into being a better knight.

896
00:37:11.246 --> 00:37:12.983
And then one day he's on his way back

897
00:37:12.983 --> 00:37:15.817
to see his dying mother and he crosses the river

898
00:37:15.817 --> 00:37:18.854
and he finds that somebody can help him

899
00:37:18.854 --> 00:37:21.757
and of course it's some fisherman who say,

900
00:37:21.757 --> 00:37:23.859
"If you want to find somewhere that you could stay.

901
00:37:23.859 --> 00:37:25.861
"You can stay in my castle."

902
00:37:25.861 --> 00:37:28.932
And that castle, when he goes to it,

903
00:37:28.932 --> 00:37:31.379
he sees that the fisherman of course is the king,

904
00:37:31.379 --> 00:37:33.515
that this is the fisher king.

905
00:37:33.515 --> 00:37:36.080
The fisher king is wounded and they say he's wounded

906
00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:39.418
in his groin, which of course he's impotent,

907
00:37:39.418 --> 00:37:43.691
which basically means he has all that he ever needs

908
00:37:43.691 --> 00:37:46.326
but he can't die from his wound.

909
00:37:46.326 --> 00:37:50.165
And during the evening where there is abundance,

910
00:37:51.415 --> 00:37:53.235
Perceval sits there, and because he's been told

911
00:37:53.235 --> 00:37:55.854
to keep his mouth shut, he never asked the king,

912
00:37:55.854 --> 00:37:56.837
"What's wrong with you?

913
00:37:56.837 --> 00:37:58.569
"What ails the king?"

914
00:37:58.569 --> 00:38:02.176
And then in front of him comes the Holy Grail,

915
00:38:02.176 --> 00:38:04.204
and again because he's been told to keep quiet

916
00:38:04.204 --> 00:38:07.572
he never says, "Who does the grail serve?"

917
00:38:07.572 --> 00:38:09.616
And he goes to bed and when he wakes up

918
00:38:09.616 --> 00:38:13.082
the whole castle or everybody within it has disappeared

919
00:38:13.082 --> 00:38:16.791
and the castle has fallen into disrepair.

920
00:38:16.791 --> 00:38:19.259
And he leaves and he meets an old crone who says,

921
00:38:19.259 --> 00:38:22.094
"Why didn't you ask the questions?"

922
00:38:22.094 --> 00:38:23.630
'Cause if he had asked the questions

923
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:26.093
he would have healed the king.

924
00:38:26.093 --> 00:38:29.538
And he then starts the journey which is the journey

925
00:38:29.538 --> 00:38:32.038
of King Arthur's knights.

926
00:38:32.038 --> 00:38:34.344
So each of the 12 knights, of course the 12 aspects

927
00:38:34.344 --> 00:38:36.000
of King Arthur.

928
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.137
And Perceval grows into the great hero

929
00:38:38.137 --> 00:38:41.747
and he grows and he grows until there's nobody

930
00:38:41.747 --> 00:38:43.174
that he cannot kill.

931
00:38:43.174 --> 00:38:45.516
And by now he's become Lancelot.

932
00:38:45.516 --> 00:38:50.025
And he eventually has just one knight that he needs to kill

933
00:38:50.025 --> 00:38:51.415
and it's called the Dark Knight.

934
00:38:51.415 --> 00:38:55.031
And he meets the Dark Knight and he knocks him off the horse

935
00:38:55.031 --> 00:38:57.727
and he's about to strike him when the helmet falls off

936
00:38:57.727 --> 00:39:00.364
and he sees it's himself.

937
00:39:00.364 --> 00:39:04.123
And he realizes that he is the Dark Knight

938
00:39:04.123 --> 00:39:06.906
and he takes off his armor and he actually

939
00:39:06.906 --> 00:39:09.273
goes into the woods.

940
00:39:09.273 --> 00:39:12.177
And that point is this key where people might have

941
00:39:12.177 --> 00:39:14.014
a dark knight to the soul.

942
00:39:14.014 --> 00:39:16.643
This is the face that many people are going through

943
00:39:16.643 --> 00:39:20.919
at this time of really feeling their life is falling apart,

944
00:39:20.919 --> 00:39:23.539
even though they may have everything they've got nothing.

945
00:39:24.422 --> 00:39:26.588
It's like it doesn't matter if you're

946
00:39:26.588 --> 00:39:28.390
the best knight anymore.

947
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:30.193
And that's what people are feeling that--

948
00:39:30.193 --> 00:39:32.923
<v Voiceover>A lot of people are experiencing this now.</v>

949
00:39:32.923 --> 00:39:35.764
<v ->Yes, I might have all of this but I've got nothing.</v>

950
00:39:35.764 --> 00:39:38.273
So they're entering in the first face,

951
00:39:38.273 --> 00:39:41.332
as the face of the lover, and it goes lover,

952
00:39:41.332 --> 00:39:43.406
sage, magician.

953
00:39:43.406 --> 00:39:45.609
And these are male energies.

954
00:39:45.609 --> 00:39:49.333
And I just want to mention the lover that at that point

955
00:39:49.333 --> 00:39:52.218
when you're going to a dark night to the soul,

956
00:39:52.218 --> 00:39:55.153
nothing matters outside you, your friends may tell you,

957
00:39:55.153 --> 00:39:58.085
"Don't do it, we liked you as you were (laughs)."

958
00:39:58.085 --> 00:40:01.054
"Why not just come back and be a knight again,"

959
00:40:01.054 --> 00:40:04.298
and your family may not understand.

960
00:40:04.298 --> 00:40:07.294
And what I've understood is that inside each of us

961
00:40:07.294 --> 00:40:12.294
there has to be a love for ourselves that is deep enough

962
00:40:12.328 --> 00:40:16.309
and profound enough for us to go into the dark presence

963
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:18.844
of the crone, of the dark goddess.

964
00:40:18.844 --> 00:40:21.013
And it's that love that's being called on upon

965
00:40:21.013 --> 00:40:21.944
at the moment.

966
00:40:21.944 --> 00:40:23.553
So this isn't a journey to go to the crone

967
00:40:23.553 --> 00:40:25.174
and just have it rip you apart.

968
00:40:25.174 --> 00:40:27.785
This is a conscious choice to say,

969
00:40:27.785 --> 00:40:31.259
"That outer world no longer makes sense to me.

970
00:40:31.259 --> 00:40:35.064
"That outer world no longer holds me in its grip."

971
00:40:35.064 --> 00:40:38.326
But to go into the underworld there has to be an "I",

972
00:40:38.326 --> 00:40:42.398
there has to be a love of "I" for me to do that.

973
00:40:42.398 --> 00:40:45.605
And it's not about God loving me or my angels loving me,

974
00:40:45.605 --> 00:40:48.360
it's got to be something inside you or me.

975
00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.578
<v Voiceover>'Cause that's what will sustain you</v>

976
00:40:49.578 --> 00:40:51.095
through that journey.

977
00:40:51.095 --> 00:40:52.909
<v ->That's all there is.</v>

978
00:40:52.909 --> 00:40:56.578
And what I see is that at this particular time,

979
00:40:56.578 --> 00:41:00.083
there's been such a disassociation between me

980
00:41:00.083 --> 00:41:01.515
and my outer world.

981
00:41:01.515 --> 00:41:03.714
I can become my outer world.

982
00:41:03.714 --> 00:41:07.116
So many people are their outer world that the "I" is dead,

983
00:41:07.116 --> 00:41:10.659
that the light has almost gone out.

984
00:41:10.659 --> 00:41:14.753
And that is what is needing to be enhanced and held,

985
00:41:14.753 --> 00:41:16.413
the light of the heart.

986
00:41:17.565 --> 00:41:19.091
But it's the heart for yourself.

987
00:41:19.995 --> 00:41:22.070
That's the most powerful piece of this journey

988
00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:25.658
because you can't find it outside, it has to be within.

989
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:29.545
<v Voiceover>Would it be appropriate at this point</v>

990
00:41:29.545 --> 00:41:33.383
to take a feminine version of the tale,

991
00:41:33.383 --> 00:41:36.345
a simplified version, one that many of us

992
00:41:36.345 --> 00:41:39.495
are still hostage to in the simplest terms

993
00:41:39.495 --> 00:41:42.089
which is Snow White or Sleeping Beauty,

994
00:41:42.089 --> 00:41:45.767
the crown, the apple, death, awakening to Prince Charming,

995
00:41:45.767 --> 00:41:47.424
what's that about?

996
00:41:47.424 --> 00:41:50.373
<v ->Again, all of those stories were changed a lot.</v>

997
00:41:50.373 --> 00:41:55.067
I can certainly take the Sleeping Beauty story

998
00:41:55.067 --> 00:41:56.801
who'd be awoken by the kiss.

999
00:41:56.801 --> 00:42:00.947
But the idea was that always it was the feminine

1000
00:42:00.947 --> 00:42:03.317
who was more willing to go into the underworld

1001
00:42:03.317 --> 00:42:05.621
to meet her dark sister.

1002
00:42:05.621 --> 00:42:08.185
And it was through the feminine that the masculine then

1003
00:42:08.185 --> 00:42:09.858
could do the journey.

1004
00:42:09.858 --> 00:42:12.459
So that in the times perhaps of Isis

1005
00:42:12.459 --> 00:42:15.532
it would be Isis or her priestesses would go

1006
00:42:15.532 --> 00:42:19.698
into the underworld first, then they could then

1007
00:42:19.698 --> 00:42:22.958
be the container for the masculine to do the work

1008
00:42:22.958 --> 00:42:25.068
and I will say between men and women.

1009
00:42:25.068 --> 00:42:26.704
So if I wanted a kin to come back,

1010
00:42:26.704 --> 00:42:27.996
from a Christian point of view,

1011
00:42:27.996 --> 00:42:30.274
Mary Magdalene had to do her work first

1012
00:42:30.274 --> 00:42:32.338
before she could be the vessel for Jesus

1013
00:42:32.338 --> 00:42:34.710
to go through his underworld.

1014
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:38.916
And that it was always that women were able to do that work

1015
00:42:38.916 --> 00:42:42.489
because of their deep relationship to the menstrual cycle,

1016
00:42:42.489 --> 00:42:45.826
their understanding that this cycle is very relevant.

1017
00:42:45.826 --> 00:42:48.395
And that they recognize that during the moon time,

1018
00:42:48.395 --> 00:42:50.018
the menses, that was the death

1019
00:42:50.018 --> 00:42:51.160
and then there would be rebirth.

1020
00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.591
They hadn't forgotten.

1021
00:42:52.591 --> 00:42:55.132
Whereas the masculine part of us forgets that

1022
00:42:55.132 --> 00:42:57.463
or doesn't want to appreciate that there could be

1023
00:42:57.463 --> 00:42:59.194
such a cycle.

1024
00:42:59.194 --> 00:43:02.362
One of the stories that of course got very twisted

1025
00:43:02.362 --> 00:43:05.743
was the Persephone story, the triple goddess of Kore,

1026
00:43:05.743 --> 00:43:08.940
Demeter and Persephone, the Greek story.

1027
00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:11.041
Well of course here they say, well, Persephone,

1028
00:43:11.041 --> 00:43:14.286
or Kore, the virgin, was up playing in the little garden.

1029
00:43:14.286 --> 00:43:17.457
She sees a narcissist and all of a sudden Pluto comes up

1030
00:43:17.457 --> 00:43:20.556
out of the underworld and takes her down there

1031
00:43:20.556 --> 00:43:24.301
and rapes her, and the story continues of course

1032
00:43:24.301 --> 00:43:26.799
of Demeter grieving for her.

1033
00:43:26.799 --> 00:43:29.065
But that story was just a Greek story

1034
00:43:29.065 --> 00:43:31.493
'cause it's a much more ancient story that says

1035
00:43:31.493 --> 00:43:35.943
that Demeter and her mother and Persephone were helping

1036
00:43:35.943 --> 00:43:38.344
and Persephone says, "There's a whole lot of dead people

1037
00:43:38.344 --> 00:43:40.977
"wandering around here, who's helping them?"

1038
00:43:40.977 --> 00:43:42.381
Demeter says, "Well I'm supposed to be

1039
00:43:42.381 --> 00:43:44.381
"but I'm so busy up here."

1040
00:43:44.381 --> 00:43:46.484
And Persephone says, "Well I'll go down

1041
00:43:46.484 --> 00:43:48.817
"and look after them, is that okay with you?"

1042
00:43:48.817 --> 00:43:51.591
So her mother is not very happy but she says,

1043
00:43:51.591 --> 00:43:53.290
"Yes, you may go."

1044
00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:58.290
And Persephone takes with her a poppy and some grains,

1045
00:43:59.534 --> 00:44:02.506
but mainly the poppy seeds and the pomegranate.

1046
00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:03.972
And she goes down into the underworld

1047
00:44:03.972 --> 00:44:06.468
and she just sits in the underworld

1048
00:44:06.468 --> 00:44:09.699
and she draws towards her all parts of herself

1049
00:44:09.699 --> 00:44:11.806
that had been dead to her.

1050
00:44:11.806 --> 00:44:13.940
And she takes the pomegranate juice,

1051
00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:15.917
which is if you think of a pomegranate

1052
00:44:15.917 --> 00:44:18.889
it is like an ovary with all the eggs inside,

1053
00:44:18.889 --> 00:44:21.557
it is the juice of regeneration.

1054
00:44:21.557 --> 00:44:24.148
And she puts a little cross on the third eye

1055
00:44:24.148 --> 00:44:26.960
and gives these souls, these parts of ourselves,

1056
00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:30.592
wings to fly back into life again.

1057
00:44:30.592 --> 00:44:33.658
And these stories have got so twisted

1058
00:44:33.658 --> 00:44:37.507
that I liked that version which is basically saying,

1059
00:44:37.507 --> 00:44:39.910
"We all have to go into our underworld."

1060
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:43.340
And that women do it far more easily

1061
00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:45.843
and have the opportunity to do it every month

1062
00:44:45.843 --> 00:44:49.752
if we only remember that the moon time is not the curse

1063
00:44:49.752 --> 00:44:52.017
or something we need to get rid of.

1064
00:44:52.017 --> 00:44:54.483
<v Voiceover>We need to change our view and terminology.</v>

1065
00:44:54.483 --> 00:44:57.949
And yet the men, again through a masculine lens

1066
00:44:57.949 --> 00:45:02.599
for certainly millennia throughout history,

1067
00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:06.832
the initiation rights from the Ancient Egyptians

1068
00:45:06.832 --> 00:45:10.803
up through modern day higher levels of the Masonics and such

1069
00:45:10.803 --> 00:45:14.780
are to go through this process of death in the initiation.

1070
00:45:16.277 --> 00:45:19.978
I mean, a process of it's gotten somewhat basterdized

1071
00:45:19.978 --> 00:45:21.985
in recent times, certainly.

1072
00:45:21.985 --> 00:45:24.316
But the idea is to go through this journey

1073
00:45:24.316 --> 00:45:27.276
to reach into the darkest points of the being

1074
00:45:27.276 --> 00:45:30.254
and touch with death and to emerge victorious

1075
00:45:30.254 --> 00:45:31.814
on the other side.

1076
00:45:31.814 --> 00:45:35.797
<v ->I mean, I have not been part of those cycles</v>

1077
00:45:35.797 --> 00:45:38.027
so I don't know quite what they mentioned.

1078
00:45:38.027 --> 00:45:39.493
But there were two times--

1079
00:45:39.493 --> 00:45:41.051
<v Voiceover>You go through extreme challenges</v>

1080
00:45:41.051 --> 00:45:43.597
in the psyche world and physically and so forth.

1081
00:45:43.597 --> 00:45:44.836
<v ->But there were two ways in which (mumbles)</v>

1082
00:45:44.836 --> 00:45:47.173
and the crone comes into the cycle.

1083
00:45:47.173 --> 00:45:50.302
One is when the hero is growing towards the king,

1084
00:45:50.302 --> 00:45:52.802
and of course we see a lot of these initiations

1085
00:45:52.802 --> 00:45:57.802
in universities, where challenges come at the hero

1086
00:45:58.485 --> 00:46:02.553
to meet the parts of him that he is not strong with.

1087
00:46:02.553 --> 00:46:06.313
And therefore, he is challenged to refine his strength

1088
00:46:06.313 --> 00:46:08.189
so he can be king.

1089
00:46:08.189 --> 00:46:11.400
And I think a lot of those initiations are merely ways

1090
00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:15.553
of strengthening the hero, not taking him apart.

1091
00:46:19.729 --> 00:46:22.171
There's been a tendency to strengthen people up

1092
00:46:22.171 --> 00:46:24.695
by making them hide from their psyche.

1093
00:46:25.866 --> 00:46:30.164
Many of the 1980s psychological games, test

1094
00:46:30.164 --> 00:46:35.164
were I will may strip you so that you can become stronger.

1095
00:46:35.553 --> 00:46:39.096
All that happens is the psyche hides

1096
00:46:39.096 --> 00:46:42.231
because where shame exist you ain't gonna go there

1097
00:46:42.231 --> 00:46:44.820
when someone's battling against you.

1098
00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:47.698
Shame only emerges through love,

1099
00:46:47.698 --> 00:46:50.149
it only emerges in the heart of the mother.

1100
00:46:51.731 --> 00:46:55.272
You're only gonna show your shame when you feel safe.

1101
00:46:55.272 --> 00:46:57.100
And you're only gonna let yourself love

1102
00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:58.910
those unlovable parts when you feel

1103
00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:01.013
that you're not gonna be judged.

1104
00:47:01.013 --> 00:47:02.978
And most of those initiation processes

1105
00:47:02.978 --> 00:47:06.519
were to judge anything that looked weak.

1106
00:47:06.519 --> 00:47:09.517
So I feel that all that happened is that we,

1107
00:47:09.517 --> 00:47:12.993
there was a development of a thicker shield

1108
00:47:12.993 --> 00:47:17.993
that send the pain deeper so nobody would ever see it.

1109
00:47:18.399 --> 00:47:19.867
<v Voiceover>Interesting.</v>

1110
00:47:19.867 --> 00:47:23.093
<v ->And I feel that the problem that we have</v>

1111
00:47:23.093 --> 00:47:25.877
with post-traumatic stress syndrome,

1112
00:47:27.029 --> 00:47:29.779
the stage of the development of the hero,

1113
00:47:29.779 --> 00:47:32.811
in a mythological point of view,

1114
00:47:32.811 --> 00:47:35.649
is for him to have a strong relationship with the earth

1115
00:47:35.649 --> 00:47:37.981
and a strong relationship to spirit.

1116
00:47:37.981 --> 00:47:41.352
And in many cultures they would spend the first five years,

1117
00:47:41.352 --> 00:47:43.955
the young boy would spend with his mother

1118
00:47:43.955 --> 00:47:47.886
being weak, connected to the earth, earth-grounded.

1119
00:47:47.886 --> 00:47:49.823
And at that time it would often be

1120
00:47:49.823 --> 00:47:52.133
that they would plant a tree and that would be their

1121
00:47:52.133 --> 00:47:54.130
first obelisk or their first tree.

1122
00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:56.437
And then he'd be handed over to the male

1123
00:47:56.437 --> 00:47:58.564
and he would not see his mother again

1124
00:47:58.564 --> 00:48:00.603
as he would strengthen up and they planted a second tree

1125
00:48:00.603 --> 00:48:03.378
and this was his path; his connection to the earth

1126
00:48:03.378 --> 00:48:05.374
and his connection to the sky.

1127
00:48:05.374 --> 00:48:08.883
I feel we have lost that in our young men.

1128
00:48:08.883 --> 00:48:11.376
And that many of them are not connected

1129
00:48:11.376 --> 00:48:13.955
either to the earth fully before they go to war

1130
00:48:13.955 --> 00:48:15.391
or to the sky fully.

1131
00:48:15.391 --> 00:48:16.584
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

1132
00:48:16.584 --> 00:48:20.155
<v ->And therefore, their ability to have two strong pillars</v>

1133
00:48:20.155 --> 00:48:22.230
by which they know who they are,

1134
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:24.354
I think when they go into these war situations

1135
00:48:24.354 --> 00:48:25.197
they haven't got a clue.

1136
00:48:25.197 --> 00:48:27.532
And my greatest challenge with PTSD

1137
00:48:27.532 --> 00:48:29.797
is that we are not recognizing that.

1138
00:48:29.797 --> 00:48:32.468
We're just finding ways to send people back to war.

1139
00:48:32.468 --> 00:48:34.943
Whereas, what we really should be recognizing

1140
00:48:34.943 --> 00:48:38.203
is why is there such an increase in PTSD.

1141
00:48:38.203 --> 00:48:40.139
Probably because of these young boys

1142
00:48:40.139 --> 00:48:42.543
who are far more conscious spiritually

1143
00:48:42.543 --> 00:48:44.051
than perhaps 40 or 50 years ago.

1144
00:48:44.051 --> 00:48:45.182
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

1145
00:48:45.182 --> 00:48:47.585
<v ->And are having greater challenges</v>

1146
00:48:47.585 --> 00:48:50.689
than perhaps 40 or 50 years ago.

1147
00:48:50.689 --> 00:48:52.624
<v Voiceover>So looking at the cycle--</v>

1148
00:48:52.624 --> 00:48:54.386
<v ->I keep coming back to the hero, the male--</v>

1149
00:48:55.596 --> 00:48:58.481
<v Voiceover>Let's just fly with that.</v>

1150
00:48:59.301 --> 00:49:02.005
Where we are right now, we can see where we are,

1151
00:49:02.005 --> 00:49:05.055
we can see what the challenges and the problems are.

1152
00:49:06.102 --> 00:49:09.975
What do you see as the opportunity for the female in us

1153
00:49:09.975 --> 00:49:14.742
and what is it we should be effectively doing or being

1154
00:49:14.742 --> 00:49:17.676
on the feminine side of this equation

1155
00:49:17.676 --> 00:49:20.782
as we move through this 36-year cycle

1156
00:49:20.782 --> 00:49:23.455
to whatever lies ahead on the other side?

1157
00:49:23.455 --> 00:49:25.961
<v ->So we have mentioned the mother side,</v>

1158
00:49:25.961 --> 00:49:29.065
find balance, make sure you nurture yourself

1159
00:49:29.065 --> 00:49:31.923
as much doing as giving.

1160
00:49:31.923 --> 00:49:33.901
And in many ways I am saying to a lot of people,

1161
00:49:33.901 --> 00:49:35.601
"I don't care what you do for somebody else.

1162
00:49:35.601 --> 00:49:37.333
"What do you do for yourself?"

1163
00:49:37.333 --> 00:49:39.006
Because if you cannot nurture yourself

1164
00:49:39.006 --> 00:49:41.575
that's the level we can nurture someone else.

1165
00:49:41.575 --> 00:49:43.639
So I don't care how great a healer you are.

1166
00:49:43.639 --> 00:49:45.399
If you are not able to do it for yourself

1167
00:49:45.399 --> 00:49:47.506
you can't do it for someone else.

1168
00:49:47.506 --> 00:49:48.317
<v Voiceover>Critical.</v>

1169
00:49:48.317 --> 00:49:50.017
<v ->And that has to be a starting point</v>

1170
00:49:50.017 --> 00:49:53.021
to any healing training or whatever.

1171
00:49:53.021 --> 00:49:55.291
The virgin has two different faces.

1172
00:49:55.291 --> 00:49:58.956
As I said, both of them have an intuitive face.

1173
00:50:00.166 --> 00:50:03.730
In many ways we love the factor of when we say,

1174
00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:04.761
"Oh why are you doing that?"

1175
00:50:04.761 --> 00:50:06.055
"Oh my intuition said I should.

1176
00:50:06.055 --> 00:50:08.965
"I woke up with this idea."

1177
00:50:08.965 --> 00:50:12.605
But it's feeding a little bit of our masculine again.

1178
00:50:12.605 --> 00:50:13.998
But there is another face with the feminine

1179
00:50:13.998 --> 00:50:16.078
which was related to Brigid.

1180
00:50:16.078 --> 00:50:18.309
Brigid was a,

1181
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:23.309
is an Irish goddess but she also has many different faces

1182
00:50:23.673 --> 00:50:25.904
and different names.

1183
00:50:25.904 --> 00:50:29.052
But she was very similar to the Vestal Virgins

1184
00:50:29.052 --> 00:50:31.851
and they both kept the fire alive.

1185
00:50:31.851 --> 00:50:35.655
And I think that the symbolism of why were these great,

1186
00:50:35.655 --> 00:50:37.695
especially the Romans who were so patriarchal,

1187
00:50:37.695 --> 00:50:40.658
want to spend all this time keeping these women there

1188
00:50:40.658 --> 00:50:43.669
to just keep this fire alive, is that they understood

1189
00:50:43.669 --> 00:50:44.673
the power of fire.

1190
00:50:44.673 --> 00:50:46.509
And again, if you think of our own mentality

1191
00:50:46.509 --> 00:50:48.835
we forget fire, we just take it for granted.

1192
00:50:48.835 --> 00:50:52.732
But what they were saying is the fires within the heart;

1193
00:50:52.732 --> 00:50:56.100
if you don't feed your heart your fire goes out,

1194
00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:57.912
your creativity goes out.

1195
00:50:57.912 --> 00:50:59.208
<v Voiceover>So you have to nurture this.</v>

1196
00:50:59.208 --> 00:51:00.021
<v ->You have to nurture it.</v>

1197
00:51:00.021 --> 00:51:03.123
And it's nurtured by feeding it not only with light

1198
00:51:03.123 --> 00:51:04.557
but with darkness.

1199
00:51:04.557 --> 00:51:06.728
It's kept alive.

1200
00:51:06.728 --> 00:51:10.214
And Brigid is your commitment, your dedication.

1201
00:51:11.252 --> 00:51:14.896
You can even look at Vesta in your chart and astrology chart

1202
00:51:14.896 --> 00:51:18.372
but Brigid says, "What are you dedicated to?

1203
00:51:18.372 --> 00:51:19.870
"What are you committed to?

1204
00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:21.809
"What lights your fire?"

1205
00:51:21.809 --> 00:51:24.973
And it's not the same as your passion,

1206
00:51:24.973 --> 00:51:28.341
it's in the middle of your darkness.

1207
00:51:28.341 --> 00:51:31.118
What do you go towards?

1208
00:51:31.118 --> 00:51:33.285
Because everybody has something they go towards.

1209
00:51:33.285 --> 00:51:35.387
So it's a part of our intuition,

1210
00:51:35.387 --> 00:51:38.018
but what is your pilot light?

1211
00:51:38.018 --> 00:51:40.615
What makes you tick at the deepest level?

1212
00:51:40.615 --> 00:51:41.693
<v Voiceover>Your deepest fuel, as it were.</v>

1213
00:51:41.693 --> 00:51:43.099
<v ->Your deepest fuel, not your obsession,</v>

1214
00:51:43.099 --> 00:51:45.694
not what do you gonna spend lots of energy on is.

1215
00:51:47.222 --> 00:51:49.334
We've all had very dark moments, I'm sure.

1216
00:51:49.334 --> 00:51:52.805
In those moments, what is it that gets you out of bed?

1217
00:51:52.805 --> 00:51:55.443
What is it that makes you even want to live?

1218
00:51:55.443 --> 00:51:58.614
And that's Brigid, Brigid says, "Come on."

1219
00:51:58.614 --> 00:52:00.542
She's your cheerleader.

1220
00:52:00.542 --> 00:52:01.398
<v Voiceover>And there's no judgment</v>

1221
00:52:01.398 --> 00:52:02.617
as to what that fuel is?

1222
00:52:02.617 --> 00:52:07.617
<v ->No, she feeds you with something that just goes,</v>

1223
00:52:07.938 --> 00:52:11.980
"Ah yes, we're gonna do that."

1224
00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:15.660
So the intuition, often we don't notice the candle

1225
00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:18.530
when there's bright light, we only notice it in the dark.

1226
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:19.794
I'm all for people.

1227
00:52:19.794 --> 00:52:21.335
I really say, "Listen to your heart."

1228
00:52:21.335 --> 00:52:25.453
In this time, because we're in this period of dying,

1229
00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:29.159
it's not gonna be, "Hey, what should we create?"

1230
00:52:29.159 --> 00:52:30.772
Because none of us are creating anything new,

1231
00:52:30.772 --> 00:52:32.379
we're all just finishing what we haven't before

1232
00:52:32.379 --> 00:52:35.216
in the last 26,000 years so there's nothing new we're doing.

1233
00:52:35.216 --> 00:52:38.686
But what is the hardest part is what's dead,

1234
00:52:38.686 --> 00:52:40.851
what do we need to die to?

1235
00:52:40.851 --> 00:52:42.972
And it's there at the crone and the virgin

1236
00:52:42.972 --> 00:52:45.125
with a similar love for us say,

1237
00:52:45.125 --> 00:52:48.185
"Come on, what's dead in your life?

1238
00:52:48.185 --> 00:52:50.230
"What's not nurturing you?

1239
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:52.922
"What are you doing just because you can

1240
00:52:52.922 --> 00:52:54.971
"rather than what you want to do?

1241
00:52:54.971 --> 00:52:57.290
"Is your heart in anymore?"

1242
00:52:57.290 --> 00:52:59.038
So all of those are speaking to the heart

1243
00:52:59.038 --> 00:53:01.005
and they're saying without judgment,

1244
00:53:01.005 --> 00:53:03.175
"Don't do it if it doesn't excite you.

1245
00:53:03.175 --> 00:53:04.611
"Don't do it if it's not bringing you joy."

1246
00:53:04.611 --> 00:53:05.876
<v Voiceover>Oh this is a scary one</v>

1247
00:53:05.876 --> 00:53:08.602
for most people alive today, isn't it?

1248
00:53:08.602 --> 00:53:09.447
<v ->It is.</v>

1249
00:53:09.447 --> 00:53:10.413
And it's not emotional--

1250
00:53:10.413 --> 00:53:11.784
<v Voiceover>Because of the fear or loss of,</v>

1251
00:53:11.784 --> 00:53:13.553
usually loss of security i.e. income.

1252
00:53:13.553 --> 00:53:14.421
<v ->Exactly.</v>

1253
00:53:14.421 --> 00:53:15.111
<v Voiceover>If I do what I want</v>

1254
00:53:15.111 --> 00:53:16.557
who's going to pay me to do that?

1255
00:53:16.557 --> 00:53:18.027
<v ->Exactly, exactly.</v>

1256
00:53:18.027 --> 00:53:19.523
And yet people are coming home from their jobs

1257
00:53:19.523 --> 00:53:21.025
and saying, "I hate my job."

1258
00:53:21.025 --> 00:53:22.017
<v Voiceover>It's killing them.</v>

1259
00:53:22.017 --> 00:53:23.158
<v ->And then they lose their job the following day</v>

1260
00:53:23.158 --> 00:53:25.265
and they go, "Oh my God, I lost my job."

1261
00:53:25.265 --> 00:53:27.291
It's like the universe said, "You wanted to lose your job

1262
00:53:27.291 --> 00:53:29.133
"I helped you (laughs)."

1263
00:53:29.133 --> 00:53:30.601
<v Voiceover>I often applaud when that happens</v>

1264
00:53:30.601 --> 00:53:32.035
to people these days.

1265
00:53:32.035 --> 00:53:33.639
"But you didn't like your job.

1266
00:53:33.639 --> 00:53:36.338
"Yippee, now you can do something you love."

1267
00:53:36.338 --> 00:53:39.146
But still, I mean, people do have to contend with it.

1268
00:53:39.146 --> 00:53:41.279
It's very challenging.

1269
00:53:41.279 --> 00:53:44.448
<v ->One of the comments I make is, I'd say,</v>

1270
00:53:44.448 --> 00:53:46.783
if you want mantra is close all the doors

1271
00:53:46.783 --> 00:53:49.557
that are not in harmony with my soul.

1272
00:53:49.557 --> 00:53:53.260
And leave open or open those that are.

1273
00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:54.227
<v Voiceover>That's wonderful.</v>

1274
00:53:54.227 --> 00:53:57.296
<v ->And I say that because why wouldn't you want to do</v>

1275
00:53:57.296 --> 00:53:59.566
what was only in harmony of your soul?

1276
00:53:59.566 --> 00:54:02.432
And so when the door is shut it's a recognition of,

1277
00:54:02.432 --> 00:54:03.895
"Wow, I've been doing all these things

1278
00:54:03.895 --> 00:54:05.397
"that weren't in harmony.

1279
00:54:05.397 --> 00:54:07.569
"I've been pushing those pieces of the jigsaw together

1280
00:54:07.569 --> 00:54:09.110
"that never worked."

1281
00:54:09.110 --> 00:54:13.043
And that your soul is saying, "I will help you."

1282
00:54:13.043 --> 00:54:15.443
I mean, there is so much help for us at this time.

1283
00:54:15.443 --> 00:54:17.748
But we're clinging on to the most ridiculous things

1284
00:54:17.748 --> 00:54:20.854
because the key to this is there is so much abundance

1285
00:54:20.854 --> 00:54:24.352
out there for us; we will not know ourselves.

1286
00:54:24.352 --> 00:54:28.560
Our capabilities, spiritually, are immense

1287
00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:31.759
compared with what we are seeing at this moment.

1288
00:54:31.759 --> 00:54:34.131
And this is going to get more and more fast

1289
00:54:34.131 --> 00:54:36.262
as we move towards 2012.

1290
00:54:36.262 --> 00:54:39.557
In February 2012, Neptune goes into Pisces,

1291
00:54:39.557 --> 00:54:41.339
Neptune is the planet of dissolving,

1292
00:54:41.339 --> 00:54:45.814
Pisces is the sign of tremendous creativity.

1293
00:54:45.814 --> 00:54:48.376
Neptune and Pisces they're in together and they go,

1294
00:54:48.376 --> 00:54:51.851
"You didn't do anything and yet based on you can do anything

1295
00:54:51.851 --> 00:54:54.652
"comes but I don't want anything,

1296
00:54:54.652 --> 00:54:57.816
"I want to go back to that old pattern."

1297
00:54:57.816 --> 00:55:01.228
<v Voiceover>Well, that's absolutely appropriate</v>

1298
00:55:01.228 --> 00:55:02.085
and lovely.

1299
00:55:02.085 --> 00:55:05.086
And the thing is you have, not just this,

1300
00:55:05.086 --> 00:55:07.702
but which we have spoken about in the book,

1301
00:55:07.702 --> 00:55:10.403
it is a very inspirational journey.

1302
00:55:10.403 --> 00:55:12.095
But you go through and allow people

1303
00:55:12.095 --> 00:55:13.768
to have a lot of tools to work with

1304
00:55:13.768 --> 00:55:17.431
we didn't even have time to get into the notion of geometry

1305
00:55:17.431 --> 00:55:20.115
and how geometry serves us through this journey,

1306
00:55:20.115 --> 00:55:21.976
astrology on a different level

1307
00:55:21.976 --> 00:55:24.079
and how this serves us in the journey.

1308
00:55:24.079 --> 00:55:25.687
All of this is detailed in the book.

1309
00:55:25.687 --> 00:55:28.076
We've really only talked about the first couple chapters.

1310
00:55:28.076 --> 00:55:29.916
(laughter)

1311
00:55:29.916 --> 00:55:31.957
And of course some add-ons along the way.

1312
00:55:31.957 --> 00:55:34.520
But before we wrap up because we're almost out of tape,

1313
00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:36.664
anything you'd like to say beforehand and I

1314
00:55:36.664 --> 00:55:38.962
would encourage everybody to just pick up a copy

1315
00:55:38.962 --> 00:55:40.566
and do this journey for themselves,

1316
00:55:40.566 --> 00:55:43.330
anything you'd like to say as a final thought?

1317
00:55:43.330 --> 00:55:45.469
<v ->Keep life simple, make it simple.</v>

1318
00:55:45.469 --> 00:55:46.873
Everybody's saying the same thing.

1319
00:55:46.873 --> 00:55:49.606
Many of us are going back to growing of our own vegetables

1320
00:55:49.606 --> 00:55:54.575
and that's not out of fear but reconnecting what is simple,

1321
00:55:54.575 --> 00:55:57.818
reminding ourselves it doesn't have to be so complex.

1322
00:55:57.818 --> 00:56:00.113
Follow your heart.

1323
00:56:00.113 --> 00:56:01.283
That's the hardest one.

1324
00:56:01.283 --> 00:56:04.191
Give time to listen to your heart.

1325
00:56:04.191 --> 00:56:06.881
So we get busy when we don't like the message its telling us

1326
00:56:06.881 --> 00:56:08.487
that we're unhappy.

1327
00:56:08.487 --> 00:56:12.856
But the changes that are coming are not to make us

1328
00:56:12.856 --> 00:56:15.868
more miserable, there is nothing we've done wrong,

1329
00:56:15.868 --> 00:56:19.566
we're not being punished because of our misappropriation

1330
00:56:19.566 --> 00:56:20.436
of energy.

1331
00:56:20.436 --> 00:56:24.274
We're too caught up in our own issues here.

1332
00:56:24.274 --> 00:56:26.413
The earth is going through her transformation,

1333
00:56:26.413 --> 00:56:28.300
the sun is going through its transformation,

1334
00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:30.438
the galaxy is going through its transformation;

1335
00:56:30.438 --> 00:56:33.245
we are just small parts on one level

1336
00:56:33.245 --> 00:56:36.756
and yet we are also multidimensional beings;

1337
00:56:36.756 --> 00:56:40.329
and this is a time to connect to our galactic beingness,

1338
00:56:40.329 --> 00:56:44.327
our star people beingness, where we've come from,

1339
00:56:44.327 --> 00:56:45.601
who we are.

1340
00:56:45.601 --> 00:56:48.363
If you can imagine it it's probably already happened

1341
00:56:48.363 --> 00:56:51.067
and it feels that this is a time to fly,

1342
00:56:51.067 --> 00:56:53.998
this is a time to be the unique people we are

1343
00:56:53.998 --> 00:56:56.678
and not to compare ourselves with others.

1344
00:56:56.678 --> 00:56:58.876
But that will only happen when we take ownership

1345
00:56:58.876 --> 00:57:01.746
of the parts of ourselves that we have let go of

1346
00:57:01.746 --> 00:57:04.854
and really see this as a journey to wholeness,

1347
00:57:04.854 --> 00:57:06.793
not as a journey to destruction.

1348
00:57:08.283 --> 00:57:10.108
<v Voiceover>Couldn't be said better.</v>

1349
00:57:10.108 --> 00:57:11.622
