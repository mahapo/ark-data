(upbeat techno music)

2
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.299
<v ->I decided it was time to take a crash course</v>

3
00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.368
in the history of money and economics

4
00:00:17.368 --> 00:00:18.739
to understand what's happening

5
00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:20.739
to out global economies right now.

6
00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:22.757
Luckily, I came across just that,

7
00:00:22.757 --> 00:00:24.810
the crash course by Chris Martenson.

8
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.079
It's a free online course on the history

9
00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.315
of money and debt in the U.S.

10
00:00:29.315 --> 00:00:30.749
that should be a mandatory part

11
00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.617
of our continuing education.

12
00:00:32.617 --> 00:00:34.419
I found it fascinating to understand

13
00:00:34.419 --> 00:00:36.589
how money and debt is created

14
00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:38.823
and how we've ended up in the inevitable position

15
00:00:38.823 --> 00:00:40.859
we find ourselves in now.

(upbeat techno music)

17
00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:52.203
Chris, personally I want to say thank you

18
00:00:52.203 --> 00:00:53.372
for the work you've compiled.

19
00:00:53.372 --> 00:00:55.840
It's amazingly clear.

20
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.976
It helps us understand the whole world

21
00:00:57.976 --> 00:01:00.814
of economies and monies and inflation,

22
00:01:00.814 --> 00:01:02.213
and commodities and everything

23
00:01:02.213 --> 00:01:04.317
in such a crystal clear way

24
00:01:04.317 --> 00:01:08.186
that really anybody can understand it which is great.

25
00:01:08.186 --> 00:01:09.985
You don't have to have your Ph.D.

26
00:01:09.985 --> 00:01:12.290
or Masters in Economics or anything.

27
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.492
So, thank you.

28
00:01:13.492 --> 00:01:16.361
I really appreciate that.

29
00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:17.295
<v ->Your welcome.</v>

30
00:01:17.295 --> 00:01:18.226
<v Regina>'Cause you help me understand</v>

31
00:01:18.226 --> 00:01:20.266
some things that had stopped in big question marks.

32
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:22.367
So we'll encourage anybody that wants to get the basis

33
00:01:22.367 --> 00:01:25.370
for this to go to the site and do the crash course.

34
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.105
But we're just gonna pick it up with some themes

35
00:01:27.105 --> 00:01:29.742
for right now, some of the more contemporary things

36
00:01:29.742 --> 00:01:31.109
that we're dealing with.

37
00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:35.613
It is January 2010, as we're talking,

38
00:01:35.613 --> 00:01:37.849
really interesting times.

39
00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:39.384
Can we start with the whole notion

40
00:01:39.384 --> 00:01:40.786
about money being created?

41
00:01:40.786 --> 00:01:42.387
One of the things you showed on there

42
00:01:42.387 --> 00:01:44.889
that I felt really interesting, fascinated with

43
00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:47.393
was the notion that to create in the U.S.,

44
00:01:47.393 --> 00:01:50.528
to create the first trillion dollars took 300 years.

45
00:01:50.528 --> 00:01:52.064
Now what's it down to?

46
00:01:52.064 --> 00:01:53.799
And let's talk about the implications

47
00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.933
of creating money at that rate.

48
00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:57.737
<v ->What you're referring to is the fact</v>

49
00:01:57.737 --> 00:02:01.206
that we spent 300 years of our history,

50
00:02:01.206 --> 00:02:03.575
I guess so people came over, landed here on boats,

51
00:02:03.575 --> 00:02:06.063
we fought some wars, we built roads,

52
00:02:06.063 --> 00:02:07.946
we industrialized an entire nation.

53
00:02:07.946 --> 00:02:10.348
We built schools, we went to the moon,

54
00:02:10.348 --> 00:02:12.652
everything we've done that we really can look back

55
00:02:12.652 --> 00:02:13.719
and say, "Wow, look at all that."

56
00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.054
That took a trillion dollars of money creation

57
00:02:16.054 --> 00:02:16.890
through all of that time.

58
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.623
That means all of the accumulated wealth

59
00:02:18.623 --> 00:02:21.160
of the nation had approached the limit

60
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.428
of a trillion dollars.

61
00:02:22.428 --> 00:02:25.331
And that was in 1973, '74.

62
00:02:25.331 --> 00:02:27.732
And most recently we've created a trillion dollars

63
00:02:27.732 --> 00:02:30.269
in about four, four-and-a-half months.

64
00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.804
And this just reveals something about money.

65
00:02:32.804 --> 00:02:34.206
This is the most amazing thing,

66
00:02:34.206 --> 00:02:37.475
so I went through an entire MBA program

67
00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:39.077
and a bunch of years of business without knowing

68
00:02:39.077 --> 00:02:40.911
the most important thing,

69
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:43.115
which is how money is created.

70
00:02:43.115 --> 00:02:45.083
They taught me how to scramble for it.

71
00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:46.017
<v Regina>They didn't teach you that?</v>

72
00:02:46.017 --> 00:02:47.486
<v ->Nope, they taught me how to manage it,</v>

73
00:02:47.486 --> 00:02:48.420
they taught me all the tricks.

74
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.255
We learned the taxes, accounting,

75
00:02:50.255 --> 00:02:51.322
we learned all of this stuff

76
00:02:51.322 --> 00:02:53.659
which is how you work with money,

77
00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.694
but for some reason, they never explained

78
00:02:55.694 --> 00:02:57.496
where it came from.

79
00:02:57.496 --> 00:02:59.698
And that's where the tale is actually

80
00:02:59.698 --> 00:03:01.499
has the most interest and the most import,

81
00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:03.134
and is the thing that we should be paying

82
00:03:03.134 --> 00:03:06.138
the closes attention to, because our money is created

83
00:03:06.138 --> 00:03:09.040
out of thin air, meaning that it's not backed by anything.

84
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.978
There is gold in Fort Knox, but it doesn't back a dollar.

85
00:03:11.978 --> 00:03:14.646
You can't go down to a bank and exchange a dollar

86
00:03:14.646 --> 00:03:16.649
for anything except a dollar.

87
00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:19.818
And it's just the most amazing thing

88
00:03:19.818 --> 00:03:21.686
when you can create money out of thin air.

89
00:03:21.686 --> 00:03:23.955
It really should be something that we pay

90
00:03:23.955 --> 00:03:25.023
very close attention to

91
00:03:25.023 --> 00:03:26.857
and that we're really comfortable

92
00:03:26.857 --> 00:03:29.794
that the people who are in control of that process

93
00:03:29.794 --> 00:03:32.799
know what they're doing and are really being

94
00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:33.931
as careful as they can be.

95
00:03:33.931 --> 00:03:36.736
Because, you know, the long story short

96
00:03:36.736 --> 00:03:38.804
there are over 3,800 paper currencies

97
00:03:38.804 --> 00:03:42.072
we can look at in history that have all evaporated,

98
00:03:42.072 --> 00:03:44.710
gone up in flames, gone up in inflationary flames.

99
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.946
And they all do it for the same sets of reasons

100
00:03:46.946 --> 00:03:50.716
which is that it feels like we get a little bit of relief

101
00:03:50.716 --> 00:03:53.853
through a crisis by printing a little bit of money

102
00:03:53.853 --> 00:03:55.821
so that become something that we do

103
00:03:55.821 --> 00:03:57.688
even during non-crisis times.

104
00:03:57.688 --> 00:03:58.956
And then the next crisis comes

105
00:03:58.956 --> 00:04:00.692
and we do it even faster,

106
00:04:00.692 --> 00:04:01.927
and then the next one comes

107
00:04:01.927 --> 00:04:04.162
and it just becomes a part of how we do things.

108
00:04:04.162 --> 00:04:05.163
<v Regina>Yet at the same time,</v>

109
00:04:05.163 --> 00:04:06.765
I was noticing the graph where it talks

110
00:04:06.765 --> 00:04:09.468
about conflict, war, where there's typically

111
00:04:09.468 --> 00:04:11.103
an inflationary period.

112
00:04:11.103 --> 00:04:14.940
It would go up a little bit, maybe from five to 10%,

113
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.642
five to 8% historically in the various wars,

114
00:04:17.642 --> 00:04:21.880
and again, we're keeping this to the United States history.

115
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.117
But then it would level back down again

116
00:04:24.117 --> 00:04:25.384
where it was previously,

117
00:04:25.384 --> 00:04:28.285
but that's not what we're talking about now.

118
00:04:28.285 --> 00:04:30.488
<v ->No, inflation used to be a temporary phenomenon.</v>

119
00:04:30.488 --> 00:04:31.823
We would have bouts of inflation

120
00:04:31.823 --> 00:04:33.624
that were always associated with wars.

121
00:04:33.624 --> 00:04:35.894
And wars are inflationary because what happens is

122
00:04:35.894 --> 00:04:37.696
the government creates a whole lot of extra money

123
00:04:37.696 --> 00:04:39.130
to pay for the war.

124
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.699
And war has this double whammy associated with it

125
00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.303
because the goods and services that we create and produce

126
00:04:44.303 --> 00:04:47.306
for war, we destroy them in the conflict of that war.

127
00:04:47.306 --> 00:04:48.173
<v Regina>Like bombs.</v>

128
00:04:48.173 --> 00:04:50.643
<v ->Bombs, right, so you build a bomb, cost $100,000</v>

129
00:04:50.643 --> 00:04:52.111
and then you go and you blow it up.

130
00:04:52.111 --> 00:04:54.880
Well, the bomb's gone, but the $100,000 isn't.

131
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.214
It's still rolling around.

132
00:04:56.214 --> 00:04:57.515
It went to the bomb manufacturer,

133
00:04:57.515 --> 00:04:58.383
but guess what?

134
00:04:58.383 --> 00:05:00.085
It went into their funds and out it went,

135
00:05:00.085 --> 00:05:02.521
and so wars tend to be highly inflationary.

136
00:05:02.521 --> 00:05:03.322
We know this.

137
00:05:03.322 --> 00:05:05.222
And they're highly inflationary

138
00:05:05.222 --> 00:05:07.593
because governments overspend,

139
00:05:07.593 --> 00:05:09.862
overspend relative to the economy.

140
00:05:09.862 --> 00:05:11.329
Now, we can fast forward to today,

141
00:05:11.329 --> 00:05:12.831
yes, we are fighting two wars,

142
00:05:12.831 --> 00:05:15.700
and, you know, these are gonna be inflationary,

143
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.501
but we're also fighting now the equivalent

144
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:18.936
of an economic war.

145
00:05:18.936 --> 00:05:23.142
And we are creating money again as if we were at war,

146
00:05:23.142 --> 00:05:25.309
but we're not, really, in this case,

147
00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:27.846
we're just creating money because we're in a crisis,

148
00:05:27.846 --> 00:05:29.547
because this is what we do now,

149
00:05:29.547 --> 00:05:32.117
because it's our first big lever that we pull

150
00:05:32.117 --> 00:05:35.053
when we get into this sort of crisis territory.

151
00:05:35.053 --> 00:05:38.022
So the amount of money that we are creating right now

152
00:05:38.022 --> 00:05:40.793
is so far in excess of what our economy needs

153
00:05:40.793 --> 00:05:43.995
or what it can sustain, so far beyond the production

154
00:05:43.995 --> 00:05:46.531
of goods and services that it's pretty much a guarantee

155
00:05:46.531 --> 00:05:48.166
at this point that that money

156
00:05:48.166 --> 00:05:49.567
is gonna come back and haunt us.

157
00:05:49.567 --> 00:05:51.703
And, you know, how would you detect that?

158
00:05:51.703 --> 00:05:53.604
It's gonna be rising prices.

159
00:05:53.604 --> 00:05:55.840
Now, remember, inflation is a symptom.

160
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.924
But the cause, why did the prices go up?

161
00:05:57.924 --> 00:05:58.910
What caused that?

162
00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:59.977
That was money.

163
00:05:59.977 --> 00:06:02.180
The money system itself, overproducing money,

164
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.347
that's the key thing.

165
00:06:03.347 --> 00:06:04.516
So we should all be looking at that.

166
00:06:04.516 --> 00:06:06.418
Don't worry about, you know, has toilet paper doubled

167
00:06:06.418 --> 00:06:08.786
in price, that's interesting, and you can use that

168
00:06:08.786 --> 00:06:12.924
as a canary, but we're interested in the gas and the mine,

169
00:06:12.924 --> 00:06:15.093
not the fact that the canary died.

170
00:06:15.093 --> 00:06:17.530
This is something anybody who cares to,

171
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.130
luckily we live in a free and open society,

172
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.533
we publish all the statistics, and anybody who wants to

173
00:06:21.533 --> 00:06:23.268
can go to the Federal Reserve website,

174
00:06:23.268 --> 00:06:24.835
look it up, and oh my gosh,

175
00:06:24.835 --> 00:06:26.237
it's all there in black and white.

176
00:06:26.237 --> 00:06:28.172
We are dumping money into the ether

177
00:06:28.172 --> 00:06:29.574
as fast as we possibly can.

178
00:06:29.574 --> 00:06:30.676
It's astounding.

179
00:06:30.676 --> 00:06:31.944
<v Regina>Well, and as you said,</v>

180
00:06:31.944 --> 00:06:33.278
it would be okay if we had people

181
00:06:33.278 --> 00:06:35.279
that we trusted at the helm doing this,

182
00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:39.351
in a, you know, essentially, a very ordered fashioned

183
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:41.352
for a specific purpose.

184
00:06:41.352 --> 00:06:43.822
But we're way beyond that now.

185
00:06:43.822 --> 00:06:46.658
<v ->It's not only being done in a disorganized way,</v>

186
00:06:46.658 --> 00:06:49.093
I'm convinced it's being done in a criminal way.

187
00:06:49.093 --> 00:06:52.031
People who are in power right now,

188
00:06:52.031 --> 00:06:53.198
there's a revolving door,

189
00:06:53.198 --> 00:06:54.366
we've noticed this for a long time.

190
00:06:54.366 --> 00:06:55.733
People come out of Wall Street and they go

191
00:06:55.733 --> 00:06:57.167
to the Treasury Department, and they come out of there

192
00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:58.670
and they go back to Wall Street, and sometimes they go

193
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.071
to the CIA, and then they come out of there

194
00:07:00.071 --> 00:07:01.440
and they go to the State Department.

195
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.775
And so there's been this revolving door

196
00:07:02.775 --> 00:07:04.709
between the money center powers

197
00:07:04.709 --> 00:07:07.178
and the government powers and it's been going on

198
00:07:07.178 --> 00:07:10.715
long enough that I feel like they've lost any sense

199
00:07:10.715 --> 00:07:14.619
of direction, that they've been telling themselves

200
00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:17.289
the same stories long enough that they have a story

201
00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:20.259
that works for them, but it's not our story any more,

202
00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:24.128
it's really a story of special interests and of power

203
00:07:24.128 --> 00:07:27.332
and of, you know, lots of history and baggage

204
00:07:27.332 --> 00:07:28.899
between all the various players.

205
00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:32.337
And, frankly, at this point, the criminal aspect

206
00:07:32.337 --> 00:07:34.974
I referred to it was flat out obvious to me

207
00:07:34.974 --> 00:07:38.009
when Hank Paulson came to Congress

208
00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:41.011
for the original $750 billion of TARP money,

209
00:07:41.011 --> 00:07:44.615
and he said, "Only three conditions:

210
00:07:44.615 --> 00:07:46.885
"I'm not gonna tell you who I'm giving it to,

211
00:07:46.885 --> 00:07:49.787
"you can't review any of my actions

212
00:07:49.787 --> 00:07:51.222
"and I'm not gonna be criminally liable

213
00:07:51.222 --> 00:07:52.223
"at any point in the future."

214
00:07:52.223 --> 00:07:53.525
What?

215
00:07:53.525 --> 00:07:56.661
<v Regina>And can't, big can't, red flag,</v>

216
00:07:56.661 --> 00:07:58.330
that's just amazing.

217
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.567
And yet, why, I mean, that's a whole other subject.

218
00:08:02.567 --> 00:08:04.568
That people don't seem to be,

219
00:08:04.568 --> 00:08:08.139
the average person, like us, we don't seem to be really,

220
00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:11.576
you know, taking up banners and camping out

221
00:08:11.576 --> 00:08:14.612
on the steps of the Capitol or Federal Reserve.

222
00:08:14.612 --> 00:08:16.815
In fact, there's never anyone at the Federal Reserve.

223
00:08:16.815 --> 00:08:18.049
We went there recently to check

224
00:08:18.049 --> 00:08:20.751
and one little guard at the door with a little gun.

225
00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:21.785
We said, "Where is everybody?"

226
00:08:21.785 --> 00:08:24.089
They said, "Well, look where we are,

227
00:08:24.089 --> 00:08:26.291
"it's kind of off the Wall Street path."

228
00:08:26.291 --> 00:08:28.626
And we said, "No, you wouldn't want to advertise

229
00:08:28.626 --> 00:08:30.029
"this place, would you?"

230
00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:33.264
They said, "Well, that's true, no neon lights."

231
00:08:33.264 --> 00:08:37.368
But why are we, why are the people not doing anything?

232
00:08:37.368 --> 00:08:38.837
It has to be because we're really not

233
00:08:38.837 --> 00:08:40.739
very well informed about this.

234
00:08:40.739 --> 00:08:42.174
<v ->Well being better informed should be</v>

235
00:08:42.174 --> 00:08:43.107
a part of the equation.

236
00:08:43.107 --> 00:08:43.942
But another thing is

237
00:08:43.942 --> 00:08:46.077
that people are doing things all the time.

238
00:08:46.077 --> 00:08:49.748
I truly believe it's not well advertised.

239
00:08:49.748 --> 00:08:51.917
So we had a Tea Party movement that went through,

240
00:08:51.917 --> 00:08:54.186
and I think that almost two million people showed up,

241
00:08:54.186 --> 00:08:55.853
and that's an enormous quantity of people.

242
00:08:55.853 --> 00:08:57.054
<v Regina>Actually, you're right, that is true.</v>

243
00:08:57.054 --> 00:08:58.724
<v ->And it was largely marginalized,</v>

244
00:08:58.724 --> 00:09:00.692
and they found some whack-a-doodles in the audience,

245
00:09:00.692 --> 00:09:02.428
and it was sort of painted in a certain way,

246
00:09:02.428 --> 00:09:04.678
and that was unforturnate, but...

247
00:09:06.097 --> 00:09:07.466
I have been finding in my work

248
00:09:07.466 --> 00:09:09.100
that more and more people get it,

249
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.604
many people are quite outraged at this point in time.

250
00:09:12.604 --> 00:09:15.373
But we don't really have an effective way of organizing yet.

251
00:09:15.373 --> 00:09:16.207
<v Regina>That's true.</v>

252
00:09:16.207 --> 00:09:17.875
<v ->In this country, so that our power,</v>

253
00:09:17.875 --> 00:09:20.044
our anger and power can turn into something

254
00:09:20.044 --> 00:09:21.411
that's easily recognized.

255
00:09:21.411 --> 00:09:22.782
<v Regina>That is true.</v>

256
00:09:22.782 --> 00:09:23.848
<v ->We've really been marginalized,</v>

257
00:09:23.848 --> 00:09:27.085
but I'll say this, when my father was raising me,

258
00:09:27.085 --> 00:09:28.820
he was a single income person

259
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.888
and now you need at least two incomes

260
00:09:30.888 --> 00:09:32.158
to manage most families.

261
00:09:32.158 --> 00:09:34.859
And so that just pulls all of our time away.

262
00:09:34.859 --> 00:09:37.128
And we had a contract, we had a bargain.

263
00:09:37.128 --> 00:09:39.530
The bargain was we were gonna live our lives

264
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.133
doing what we do out here

265
00:09:41.133 --> 00:09:43.134
in, you know, where real people live,

266
00:09:43.134 --> 00:09:45.669
and in Washington, they were gonna to do what they do.

267
00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:46.804
And hopefully we were both

268
00:09:46.804 --> 00:09:48.406
gonna keep up our ends of the bargain.

269
00:09:48.406 --> 00:09:50.308
I feel like Washington has broken the bargain

270
00:09:50.308 --> 00:09:51.642
with the people.

271
00:09:51.642 --> 00:09:53.644
And so it's gonna take a little time for us

272
00:09:53.644 --> 00:09:56.315
to wake back up and pull that responsibility back in

273
00:09:56.315 --> 00:09:59.350
and say, "Well, listen, we trusted you and we gave you

274
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:02.020
"we passed our responsibility over to you

275
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.389
"to manage things well, and you're not doing that

276
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:07.158
"good of a job, so it's time to start pulling that back."

277
00:10:07.158 --> 00:10:09.061
But that's going to be a long process, I believe.

278
00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:10.662
<v Regina>Yeah, and I didn't mean for you</v>

279
00:10:10.662 --> 00:10:13.265
to go on aside of social action, which we have here,

280
00:10:13.265 --> 00:10:15.166
but all those are points well taken.

281
00:10:15.166 --> 00:10:16.700
Let's go back to where we were before.

282
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.604
Now, let's look at just some of the criminal aspects

283
00:10:19.604 --> 00:10:22.974
of at least the moral aspects of what has happened

284
00:10:22.974 --> 00:10:24.442
in the banking industry, before we go

285
00:10:24.442 --> 00:10:26.344
into the housing bubble and such.

286
00:10:26.344 --> 00:10:29.781
And what are the ramifications of what has occurred

287
00:10:29.781 --> 00:10:31.950
so far with the bailouts?

288
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.152
I mean, we read the headlines about the bonuses

289
00:10:35.152 --> 00:10:38.924
for the top execs and so forth, and we're angry,

290
00:10:38.924 --> 00:10:41.493
but we don't really, I mean, our banks haven't folded up,

291
00:10:41.493 --> 00:10:43.661
we're not really seeing where this is playing out,

292
00:10:43.661 --> 00:10:46.831
except that we're not being extended credit, we do see that.

293
00:10:46.831 --> 00:10:47.866
But what are the total effects

294
00:10:47.866 --> 00:10:49.800
that you can see of what's happened?

295
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.703
<v ->So the first thing is that I believe</v>

296
00:10:51.703 --> 00:10:53.572
that the trillions of dollars we've given

297
00:10:53.572 --> 00:10:55.640
to the bankers is wasted money.

298
00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.008
And this isn't a new concept.

299
00:10:57.008 --> 00:11:00.044
I think it was John Stuart Mills in 1876 said,

300
00:11:00.044 --> 00:11:02.647
"Financial panics do not destroy capital,

301
00:11:02.647 --> 00:11:04.816
"they merely reveal the extent to which

302
00:11:04.816 --> 00:11:07.652
"it's been previously betrayed into unproductive works."

303
00:11:07.652 --> 00:11:09.253
<v Regina>Hmm.</v>

304
00:11:09.253 --> 00:11:11.491
<v ->So the banks already destroyed the capital.</v>

305
00:11:11.491 --> 00:11:12.391
It's already gone.

306
00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:14.558
The mortgages that are upside down,

307
00:11:14.558 --> 00:11:16.260
those are not ever gonna have value

308
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.528
that's gonna anything approach

309
00:11:17.528 --> 00:11:19.297
a hundred cents on the dollar again.

310
00:11:19.297 --> 00:11:20.697
All of the derivative structures

311
00:11:20.697 --> 00:11:22.866
they layered on top of that, that's gone.

312
00:11:22.866 --> 00:11:25.169
They've played around, they gambled, they lost.

313
00:11:25.169 --> 00:11:27.172
Now, the reason that we're not seeing more banks folding

314
00:11:27.172 --> 00:11:30.408
at this point is that the government in March of 2009

315
00:11:30.408 --> 00:11:33.511
allowed banks to hide things on their balance sheets.

316
00:11:33.511 --> 00:11:35.012
They allowed them to just sweep it off

317
00:11:35.012 --> 00:11:37.850
and say, "Put it over there, and you don't have to account

318
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.884
"for it, you don't have to market to market,

319
00:11:39.884 --> 00:11:42.621
"and you don't have to tell us the true value."

320
00:11:42.621 --> 00:11:44.490
And so they did that, and then they took

321
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.658
all this bailout money, and the very first thing they did

322
00:11:46.658 --> 00:11:50.162
with it is they said, "Well since we can exclude and ignore

323
00:11:50.162 --> 00:11:52.930
"all these losses we were really profitable."

324
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:55.167
And they gave themselves record bonuses.

325
00:11:55.167 --> 00:11:56.335
<v Regina>I know it's just so painful.</v>

326
00:11:56.335 --> 00:11:57.568
<v ->Which reminds me of that story</v>

327
00:11:57.568 --> 00:11:59.571
about the scorpion and the frog, you know,

328
00:11:59.571 --> 00:12:02.273
and the frog carries the scorpion across the water,

329
00:12:02.273 --> 00:12:04.109
but the scorpion stings it and they both drown,

330
00:12:04.109 --> 00:12:05.776
and the frog says, "Why did you do that?"

331
00:12:05.776 --> 00:12:08.513
I think he should have said, "Because I'm a banker."

332
00:12:08.513 --> 00:12:11.717
(Regina laughs)

333
00:12:11.717 --> 00:12:12.716
They couldn't help themselves,

334
00:12:12.716 --> 00:12:15.386
I mean, that's what I read in that particular story.

335
00:12:15.386 --> 00:12:17.221
<v Regina>It's a mentality that's just driven</v>

336
00:12:17.221 --> 00:12:19.657
towards self-preservation and greed, really.

337
00:12:19.657 --> 00:12:21.359
<v ->Mm-hmm.</v>

338
00:12:21.359 --> 00:12:23.428
<v Regina>And so what is</v>

339
00:12:23.428 --> 00:12:26.364
the pass-down effect been with us?

340
00:12:26.364 --> 00:12:28.366
Well, the pass down that we're gonna be living with this

341
00:12:28.366 --> 00:12:29.400
for a very long time.

342
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.971
This is actually a fairly substantial destruction

343
00:12:31.971 --> 00:12:34.440
of capital that we're gonna be going through for a while.

344
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.539
We're gonna be living with a bursting,

345
00:12:35.539 --> 00:12:38.108
this is the largest credit bubble in all of history.

346
00:12:38.108 --> 00:12:39.977
So, when I look at this, this is actually has

347
00:12:39.977 --> 00:12:42.815
a very simple plot line to me, and it's a very simple story.

348
00:12:42.815 --> 00:12:45.215
So people ask me, "Gosh, very complicated,

349
00:12:45.215 --> 00:12:46.684
"how do I understand this crisis?"

350
00:12:46.684 --> 00:12:48.652
I say, "I can put it in a pamphlet,

351
00:12:48.652 --> 00:12:52.356
"and it would be titled Too Much Debt."

352
00:12:52.356 --> 00:12:54.025
Everything else, the subprimes,

353
00:12:54.025 --> 00:12:56.362
the lending standards, and the regulatory lapses,

354
00:12:56.362 --> 00:12:58.496
and the derivatives and all of that,

355
00:12:58.496 --> 00:13:00.364
those are supporting characters

356
00:13:00.364 --> 00:13:03.735
in a story that really just, it just reads too much debt.

357
00:13:03.735 --> 00:13:05.803
So this is what I was watching and looking at

358
00:13:05.803 --> 00:13:08.039
when I was making some of the very profound moves

359
00:13:08.039 --> 00:13:10.742
in my own life, the reason why I got out of the stock market

360
00:13:10.742 --> 00:13:12.377
a long time ago, much higher prices,

361
00:13:12.377 --> 00:13:14.646
the reason why I knew I wanted to get into gold and silver.

362
00:13:14.646 --> 00:13:17.983
A lot of these things came from one simple observation,

363
00:13:17.983 --> 00:13:21.619
from 2000 to 2008, total credit market debt

364
00:13:21.619 --> 00:13:24.757
in the United States doubled.

365
00:13:24.757 --> 00:13:28.594
It went from 26 trillion to 52 trillion

366
00:13:28.594 --> 00:13:30.429
in eight years.

367
00:13:30.429 --> 00:13:32.631
It doubled, total debt.

368
00:13:32.631 --> 00:13:34.300
And this is, I'm not just saying government debt,

369
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.371
this is government, corporate, state, federal, personal.

370
00:13:37.371 --> 00:13:39.236
So we were all on a debt binge.

371
00:13:39.236 --> 00:13:40.941
And over that same period of time,

372
00:13:40.941 --> 00:13:43.174
no new net jobs were created,

373
00:13:43.174 --> 00:13:45.443
and median wages went backwards.

374
00:13:45.443 --> 00:13:46.845
And I was watching all of this unfold,

375
00:13:46.845 --> 00:13:48.045
and every year it just got larger,

376
00:13:48.045 --> 00:13:50.215
and I said this can't work out.

377
00:13:50.215 --> 00:13:51.549
We all know how debt works,

378
00:13:51.549 --> 00:13:54.085
you pay it back or you default on it.

379
00:13:54.085 --> 00:13:56.587
That's it, there's no other options out there.

380
00:13:56.587 --> 00:13:58.624
So how can you double the total amount of debt

381
00:13:58.624 --> 00:13:59.790
while your jobs and wages

382
00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.493
are going backwards or stagnating?

383
00:14:01.493 --> 00:14:03.461
It just didn't add up.

384
00:14:03.461 --> 00:14:05.397
And so this is the trick I use to get through life,

385
00:14:05.397 --> 00:14:07.431
this is how I've been able to make many

386
00:14:07.431 --> 00:14:08.765
of the large decisions in my life,

387
00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:11.570
is I just look at the really, the biggest story I can,

388
00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.138
and I say, "Does this make sense?"

389
00:14:13.138 --> 00:14:14.573
If the answer is no, I say,

390
00:14:14.573 --> 00:14:16.575
"Well then, it's probably gonna stop."

391
00:14:16.575 --> 00:14:18.542
And then I just try to figure out when it might stop

392
00:14:18.542 --> 00:14:21.078
and what it would look like when it does,

393
00:14:21.078 --> 00:14:22.080
when the music finally stops.

394
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.348
<v Regina>Not a pretty picture when it stops.</v>

395
00:14:24.348 --> 00:14:27.018
<v ->No, no, and this was a global credit bubble.</v>

396
00:14:27.018 --> 00:14:28.518
Alan Greenspan, bless his heart,

397
00:14:28.518 --> 00:14:30.254
he blew the largest bubble in all of history

398
00:14:30.254 --> 00:14:32.424
and this is the real danger in this story,

399
00:14:32.424 --> 00:14:34.291
because, yes, we had the tool or bubble

400
00:14:34.291 --> 00:14:36.226
which impacted a very small part of Holland

401
00:14:36.226 --> 00:14:38.896
in the 1600s and then we had a South Sea bubble,

402
00:14:38.896 --> 00:14:41.498
and that blew up France at one point in time,

403
00:14:41.498 --> 00:14:43.735
and then England, and then we had a railroad bubble

404
00:14:43.735 --> 00:14:45.336
here in this country, but it impacted

405
00:14:45.336 --> 00:14:47.538
a relatively small swath of investors,

406
00:14:47.538 --> 00:14:51.242
but this bubble impacts the whole world.

407
00:14:51.242 --> 00:14:53.544
If you think we had an amazing property bubble

408
00:14:53.544 --> 00:14:56.347
here in America, you should see what happened in Ireland.

409
00:14:56.347 --> 00:14:57.115
And if you think that's bad,

410
00:14:57.115 --> 00:14:58.616
you should see what happened in Spain.

411
00:14:58.616 --> 00:15:00.151
I mean, they just blow us off the charts.

412
00:15:00.151 --> 00:15:01.318
It's just amazing.

413
00:15:01.318 --> 00:15:02.920
<v Regina>And that story hasn't even been told yet.</v>

414
00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.856
<v ->It's getting told, it's absolutely getting told.</v>

415
00:15:04.856 --> 00:15:06.857
<v Regina>I mean, it's still to be revealed</v>

416
00:15:06.857 --> 00:15:08.393
in terms of true numbers and such

417
00:15:08.393 --> 00:15:09.993
over the next few years, right?

418
00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:10.928
<v ->Oh, absolutely.</v>

419
00:15:10.928 --> 00:15:12.030
If we're gonna be totally honest.

420
00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.030
<v Regina>Accounting isn't honest</v>

421
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:14.232
so we don't exactly where we are.

422
00:15:14.232 --> 00:15:16.134
<v ->No, no, if we look at the total credit bubble,</v>

423
00:15:16.134 --> 00:15:18.936
where we said we went from 26 trillion to 52 trillion,

424
00:15:18.936 --> 00:15:20.404
and we think of it as a bubble,

425
00:15:20.404 --> 00:15:23.574
all bubbles have this habit of being very symmetrical.

426
00:15:23.574 --> 00:15:25.510
So they start at a point and they rise,

427
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:26.910
and then they burst and they tend to go back

428
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.413
to where they started from.

429
00:15:28.413 --> 00:15:30.249
So if we apply that logic to the credit bubble

430
00:15:30.249 --> 00:15:32.883
that says we started at 26, we went to 52,

431
00:15:32.883 --> 00:15:34.385
and that's gonna have to retrace,

432
00:15:34.385 --> 00:15:36.988
which means we have $26 trillion of evaporation

433
00:15:36.988 --> 00:15:39.057
that needs to happen in our debt markets.

434
00:15:39.057 --> 00:15:40.157
It's a huge number.

435
00:15:40.157 --> 00:15:42.160
<v Regina>How's that happen besides defaults?</v>

436
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.123
<v ->It only happens through defaults,</v>

437
00:15:45.123 --> 00:15:45.663
or paying it back.

438
00:15:45.663 --> 00:15:46.998
But it can't.

439
00:15:46.998 --> 00:15:48.799
There's no way to pay back that amount of money

440
00:15:48.799 --> 00:15:50.333
out of our productive economy.

441
00:15:50.333 --> 00:15:52.204
It would, we would be in permanent recession,

442
00:15:52.204 --> 00:15:55.005
or depression and that means you can't pay anything back.

443
00:15:55.005 --> 00:15:57.441
So, it's really a, it's quite a conundrum,

444
00:15:57.441 --> 00:15:59.876
so I think happens through a process of default,

445
00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:01.579
and that's what should be happening.

446
00:16:01.579 --> 00:16:02.814
The people who,

447
00:16:02.814 --> 00:16:04.814
here's the thing that drives me a little bit nutty

448
00:16:04.814 --> 00:16:07.551
about all this, the Citibank, one Saturday morning,

449
00:16:07.551 --> 00:16:08.954
early in the Obama administration,

450
00:16:08.954 --> 00:16:11.256
they march into the offices at Citibank

451
00:16:11.256 --> 00:16:13.024
and Citi says we're in really deep trouble.

452
00:16:13.024 --> 00:16:14.692
The government says, "All right, we'll guarantee

453
00:16:14.692 --> 00:16:17.484
"$300 billion of your assets."

454
00:16:17.484 --> 00:16:18.797
Problem solved.

455
00:16:18.797 --> 00:16:22.133
The bond holders of Citi didn't take any losses on that.

456
00:16:22.133 --> 00:16:24.301
They were completely, fully compensated.

457
00:16:24.301 --> 00:16:27.404
If I'm a bond holder in a company, I'm taking a risk.

458
00:16:27.404 --> 00:16:30.207
And since I'm the bond holder, I'm the senior risk, right?

459
00:16:30.207 --> 00:16:32.011
So I get paid first, the equity people,

460
00:16:32.011 --> 00:16:34.144
people holding the shares, they get wiped out, right?

461
00:16:34.144 --> 00:16:36.014
In a normal default process.

462
00:16:36.014 --> 00:16:37.314
Nobody had to take any pain.

463
00:16:37.314 --> 00:16:40.051
So we marched in with federal tax-payer dollars,

464
00:16:40.051 --> 00:16:41.985
and we protected all the bond holders

465
00:16:41.985 --> 00:16:44.623
and all the equity holders of Citi,

466
00:16:44.623 --> 00:16:46.523
and what we really should have done is said,

467
00:16:46.523 --> 00:16:48.058
"Very sorry for your losses,

468
00:16:48.058 --> 00:16:49.494
"next time do your due diligence,

469
00:16:49.494 --> 00:16:50.794
"please do not invest in companies

470
00:16:50.794 --> 00:16:54.164
"that are run this poorly, and let's all move on."

471
00:16:54.164 --> 00:16:55.967
But we're not gonna get the learning from that,

472
00:16:55.967 --> 00:16:58.002
and we didn't allow the debt defaults to happen.

473
00:16:58.002 --> 00:17:00.304
So what's really happened instead is we've taken

474
00:17:00.304 --> 00:17:02.874
all the future economic pain that exists around Citibank,

475
00:17:02.874 --> 00:17:06.477
for example, and we've just passed that to future taxpayers.

476
00:17:06.477 --> 00:17:08.046
It didn't go away.

477
00:17:08.046 --> 00:17:09.414
It's still sitting there.

478
00:17:09.414 --> 00:17:11.349
The debts are just as ruinous as they were

479
00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:12.517
before the guarantees happened,

480
00:17:12.517 --> 00:17:15.385
and we're just gonna bleed that pain off slowly over time.

481
00:17:15.385 --> 00:17:18.032
<v Regina>And we are talking about bleeding.</v>

482
00:17:18.032 --> 00:17:19.189
On your site I was reading

483
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:22.526
that the average family of four

484
00:17:22.526 --> 00:17:24.727
is associated with three-quarters

485
00:17:24.727 --> 00:17:26.797
of a million dollars in debt.

486
00:17:26.797 --> 00:17:29.833
And that number may have increased since that was written,

487
00:17:29.833 --> 00:17:31.887
because that could've been a year or so ago, right?

488
00:17:31.887 --> 00:17:32.713
<v ->Mm-hmm.</v>

489
00:17:32.713 --> 00:17:34.538
<v Regina>So that, we could be inching up</v>

490
00:17:34.538 --> 00:17:37.841
towards 800, $900,000 per family of four.

491
00:17:37.841 --> 00:17:38.676
<v ->It's probably</v>

492
00:17:38.676 --> 00:17:39.427
<v Regina>In associated debt.</v>

493
00:17:39.427 --> 00:17:40.677
<v ->Let's call it three-quarters of a million.</v>

494
00:17:40.677 --> 00:17:41.627
It's pretty close to that.
<v Regina>Okay, three-quarters</v>

495
00:17:41.627 --> 00:17:43.037
<v Regina>of a million, all right?</v>

496
00:17:43.037 --> 00:17:45.816
And what's disturbing, I mean,

497
00:17:45.816 --> 00:17:47.820
there's a lot that's disturbing about that.

498
00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.820
It's never gonna be paid back.

499
00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.355
We think of what we saddled our children

500
00:17:52.355 --> 00:17:54.526
and their children with which is just,

501
00:17:54.526 --> 00:17:56.026
it makes you well up in tears,

502
00:17:56.026 --> 00:17:57.696
it's so unconscionable.

503
00:17:57.696 --> 00:18:00.732
And this sentence really got me.

504
00:18:00.732 --> 00:18:05.703
It said, "Debt is a claim on future human labor."

505
00:18:05.703 --> 00:18:06.337
<v ->Mm-hmm.</v>

506
00:18:06.337 --> 00:18:08.439
<v Regina>Now that's depressing for you.</v>

507
00:18:08.439 --> 00:18:10.974
<v ->Well, that's the way I look at it.</v>

508
00:18:10.974 --> 00:18:12.909
There's a number of text book definitions of money,

509
00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:13.943
well, it's a unit of account.

510
00:18:13.943 --> 00:18:14.945
<v Regina>No, but that makes sense.</v>

511
00:18:14.945 --> 00:18:15.547
That seems real.

512
00:18:15.547 --> 00:18:16.848
<v ->But it is, it's a claim on labor.</v>

513
00:18:16.848 --> 00:18:17.682
It's a claim on the future.

514
00:18:17.682 --> 00:18:19.417
So the more debt that we're piling up,

515
00:18:19.417 --> 00:18:21.086
and this is a really critical point.

516
00:18:21.086 --> 00:18:22.853
This is actually, this to me,

517
00:18:22.853 --> 00:18:24.755
is the nut of the whole argument,

518
00:18:24.755 --> 00:18:27.658
for why I believe the future has some real challenges on it.

519
00:18:27.658 --> 00:18:31.529
We have been increasing our levels of debt exponentially

520
00:18:31.529 --> 00:18:34.832
ever since the early 80s, it started to take off again.

521
00:18:34.832 --> 00:18:36.301
And so, I don't know what happened back there,

522
00:18:36.301 --> 00:18:37.634
but something happened.

523
00:18:37.634 --> 00:18:39.036
Some national psyche changed,

524
00:18:39.036 --> 00:18:41.272
maybe it started with Reagan saying deficits don't matter,

525
00:18:41.272 --> 00:18:42.506
or something happened but,

526
00:18:42.506 --> 00:18:44.342
and this is all across all of society.

527
00:18:44.342 --> 00:18:46.111
So, I'm not saying this is a government issue.

528
00:18:46.111 --> 00:18:48.112
But it's all governments, state, federal, local,

529
00:18:48.112 --> 00:18:49.914
it's corporations, it's people.

530
00:18:49.914 --> 00:18:51.781
So we started this massive experiment with debt

531
00:18:51.781 --> 00:18:53.317
and it started increasing exponentially,

532
00:18:53.317 --> 00:18:56.221
meaning there was three or four or five or 10% more

533
00:18:56.221 --> 00:18:57.555
every single year and it just kept

534
00:18:57.555 --> 00:18:59.156
going and going and going,

535
00:18:59.156 --> 00:19:01.792
but when you have debt increasing like that,

536
00:19:01.792 --> 00:19:05.362
you have an implicit assumption that the future

537
00:19:05.362 --> 00:19:07.231
is gonna be larger than the past.

538
00:19:07.231 --> 00:19:08.933
'Cause the way that debt gets paid off

539
00:19:08.933 --> 00:19:11.901
is by our productive efforts in the future.

540
00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:13.571
So when we're increasing this,

541
00:19:13.571 --> 00:19:15.106
we're trusting that the future's increasing

542
00:19:15.106 --> 00:19:16.475
right along with it.

543
00:19:16.475 --> 00:19:18.177
And the problem with this story comes in

544
00:19:18.177 --> 00:19:20.343
if you can find anything in that tale that suggests

545
00:19:20.343 --> 00:19:24.648
that the future can't be as large as it needs to be

546
00:19:24.648 --> 00:19:26.884
to pay off this debt today.

547
00:19:26.884 --> 00:19:28.352
If that's the case, then the debt today

548
00:19:28.352 --> 00:19:29.954
is already worthless, we have to discount it,

549
00:19:29.954 --> 00:19:32.022
we have to imagine that some of it is going to go away.

550
00:19:32.022 --> 00:19:34.559
But, more importantly, it means that that process

551
00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:36.527
of the ever increasing debts like this,

552
00:19:36.527 --> 00:19:37.829
that that has to stop,

553
00:19:37.829 --> 00:19:39.130
because sooner or later,

554
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:40.632
you've just got to come to the conclusion,

555
00:19:40.632 --> 00:19:43.333
you've got to admit, we can't continually increase this

556
00:19:43.333 --> 00:19:46.570
Because we know that the future can't support that.

557
00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:47.706
And we're at that moment.

558
00:19:47.706 --> 00:19:49.707
It's not widely recognized where we're at the moment

559
00:19:49.707 --> 00:19:53.377
where the style of life, the standard of living,

560
00:19:53.377 --> 00:19:55.212
the ways in which we organized ourselves

561
00:19:55.212 --> 00:19:58.782
that was based on constantly increasing our debt loads

562
00:19:58.782 --> 00:19:59.751
has come to an end.

563
00:19:59.751 --> 00:20:01.320
<v Regina>And that was built in.</v>

564
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.688
That was the system we were rendering.

565
00:20:02.688 --> 00:20:05.288
Right or wrong, that's the system

566
00:20:05.288 --> 00:20:06.524
that we've been functioning with.

567
00:20:06.524 --> 00:20:08.792
And now it's over.

568
00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:10.093
It can't be sustained.

569
00:20:10.093 --> 00:20:11.495
<v ->And all systems have pros and cons.</v>

570
00:20:11.495 --> 00:20:12.730
I'm not here to say, look back and that was horrible.

571
00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:13.598
It wasn't.

572
00:20:13.598 --> 00:20:15.366
We had some tremendous technological advances,

573
00:20:15.366 --> 00:20:16.867
and we had some cultural advances,

574
00:20:16.867 --> 00:20:19.070
and people lived wonderful lives,

575
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:20.439
but that has changed.

576
00:20:20.439 --> 00:20:23.808
The circumstances by which that organization worked

577
00:20:23.808 --> 00:20:26.244
have shifted, and that doesn't work anymore.

578
00:20:26.244 --> 00:20:28.445
And that's what people, I suspect now, are starting to feel

579
00:20:28.445 --> 00:20:31.581
in my work, I encounter a lot of people who kind of get it.

580
00:20:31.581 --> 00:20:33.385
Either they get it, or they get it.

581
00:20:33.385 --> 00:20:34.752
But one way or another, they understand

582
00:20:34.752 --> 00:20:36.788
that something has changed.

583
00:20:36.788 --> 00:20:39.423
And some people perceive that as things have broken,

584
00:20:39.423 --> 00:20:41.190
and it feels bad to them, and other people feel

585
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.194
the opportunity and say, "Oh, no, no, no,

586
00:20:43.194 --> 00:20:44.697
"this is just different now,

587
00:20:44.697 --> 00:20:46.197
"something different has happened."

588
00:20:46.197 --> 00:20:47.632
And it's a different future.

589
00:20:47.632 --> 00:20:50.300
So the way I look at it, is this crisis, right,

590
00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.671
that we're in right now, is actually just a transformation.

591
00:20:52.671 --> 00:20:55.205
And how you view it depends on

592
00:20:55.205 --> 00:20:56.840
how you're gonna respond to it.

593
00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.943
This has got enormous opportunity wrapped in it,

594
00:20:58.943 --> 00:21:01.211
but it's also, if you don't see it right,

595
00:21:01.211 --> 00:21:03.180
it's got enormous crisis wrapped in it.

596
00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.480
And a lot of people it's just changed,

597
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.984
it's big change, and I understand change is unsettling,

598
00:21:06.984 --> 00:21:09.119
it really is, it's uncertain,

599
00:21:09.119 --> 00:21:12.023
and a lot of people don't like uncertainty, myself included,

600
00:21:12.023 --> 00:21:14.125
but this is a moment of transformation,

601
00:21:14.125 --> 00:21:15.960
and I'm really actually quite positive

602
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.863
about a lot of things that will come to those

603
00:21:18.863 --> 00:21:20.663
who can see this in time,

604
00:21:20.663 --> 00:21:22.500
who will be able to take care of themselves,

605
00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.102
who will be in a position to help others.

606
00:21:24.102 --> 00:21:25.737
We're gonna redefine our jobs,

607
00:21:25.737 --> 00:21:28.405
what's important to us, the things we value,

608
00:21:28.405 --> 00:21:30.642
our priorities, individually and nationally,

609
00:21:30.642 --> 00:21:32.609
all these things are up for grabs now.

610
00:21:32.609 --> 00:21:34.544
So, I think that's an exciting time to be alive.

611
00:21:34.544 --> 00:21:35.747
<v Regina>I was just gonna say, I do too.</v>

612
00:21:35.747 --> 00:21:38.314
I don't feel depressed about what's to come

613
00:21:38.314 --> 00:21:39.782
for the exact same reason.

614
00:21:39.782 --> 00:21:42.019
This is a fundamental shift

615
00:21:42.019 --> 00:21:44.921
that I feel will help us

616
00:21:44.921 --> 00:21:47.124
regain our humanity on many levels,

617
00:21:47.124 --> 00:21:49.693
instead of staying on this debt mill

618
00:21:49.693 --> 00:21:51.630
where we don't even own our own hours

619
00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:53.397
or our own thoughts anymore,

620
00:21:53.397 --> 00:21:56.733
because we're so exhausted just trying to pay off the debt.

621
00:21:56.733 --> 00:21:58.836
<v ->A crisis is a terrible thing to waste.</v>

622
00:21:58.836 --> 00:22:00.338
<v Regina>Yeah, exactly,</v>

623
00:22:00.338 --> 00:22:01.605
a crisis is a terrible thing to waste.

624
00:22:01.605 --> 00:22:02.640
<v ->We should sit down,</v>

625
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.307
I mean, wouldn't this be great, to let's just stop

626
00:22:04.307 --> 00:22:07.178
for a minute and let's run down the check list:

627
00:22:07.178 --> 00:22:08.846
number of people in prison,

628
00:22:08.846 --> 00:22:12.315
levels of obesity, workplace violence,

629
00:22:12.315 --> 00:22:14.886
school standings relative internationally,

630
00:22:14.886 --> 00:22:15.953
there's all kinds of things we can put

631
00:22:15.953 --> 00:22:17.154
on our cultural check list and say,

632
00:22:17.154 --> 00:22:18.756
"How're we doing, you know?"

633
00:22:18.756 --> 00:22:19.789
<v Regina>Mm, what a D?</v>

634
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:21.759
Didn't we come up with D on one of those lists?

635
00:22:21.759 --> 00:22:24.350
<v ->Our national infrastructure, you know,</v>

636
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:25.296
where are we on these things?

637
00:22:25.296 --> 00:22:26.979
So, there's a lot of things we could,

638
00:22:26.979 --> 00:22:29.069
I hopefully, you know, would come to the conclusion

639
00:22:29.069 --> 00:22:31.067
and say, "We could fix a lot of these things."

640
00:22:31.067 --> 00:22:34.272
And to do that, though, you have to diagnose it right,

641
00:22:34.272 --> 00:22:35.873
you know, if the patient just had a heart attack

642
00:22:35.873 --> 00:22:39.176
and you diagnose it that he needs extra tubs of grease,

643
00:22:39.176 --> 00:22:41.346
you know, maybe you haven't got it right.

644
00:22:41.346 --> 00:22:43.281
You know, so if we could diagnose this right,

645
00:22:43.281 --> 00:22:46.518
I think that the problem is debt, too much debt.

646
00:22:46.518 --> 00:22:48.419
We became addicted to debt, we used it,

647
00:22:48.419 --> 00:22:50.387
we used it badly, we mismanaged it,

648
00:22:50.387 --> 00:22:52.823
it went to all kinds of misallocations, the capital,

649
00:22:52.823 --> 00:22:54.125
we wasted a lot of money,

650
00:22:54.125 --> 00:22:55.961
we squandered a lot of opportunity,

651
00:22:55.961 --> 00:22:57.394
but that's all past.

652
00:22:57.394 --> 00:22:59.363
The question that only should concern anybody

653
00:22:59.363 --> 00:23:03.835
is here we are today with these resources,

654
00:23:03.835 --> 00:23:05.301
where do we want to go?

655
00:23:05.301 --> 00:23:06.437
<v Regina>Where do we want to go</v>

656
00:23:06.437 --> 00:23:08.805
versus where do the ones who helped us create this

657
00:23:08.805 --> 00:23:11.543
this, none of this was a surprise

658
00:23:11.543 --> 00:23:13.178
from what I'm understanding.

659
00:23:13.178 --> 00:23:17.781
That the ratio of debt to the ratio of income

660
00:23:17.781 --> 00:23:21.017
started forking off about 10 years ago

661
00:23:21.017 --> 00:23:24.221
and the Fed was fully aware that we were headed for trouble.

662
00:23:24.221 --> 00:23:26.656
The debt was really on the rise.

663
00:23:26.656 --> 00:23:28.292
It's starting to go out of control.

664
00:23:28.292 --> 00:23:31.461
And they gave us these cheap interest rates, you know,

665
00:23:31.461 --> 00:23:33.231
this subprime and everything else.

666
00:23:33.231 --> 00:23:34.364
<v ->I don't know what they were doing there.</v>

667
00:23:34.364 --> 00:23:36.633
They have 350 Ph.D. columnists on staff.

668
00:23:36.633 --> 00:23:38.568
They write all kinds of gobs of papers,

669
00:23:38.568 --> 00:23:40.637
they have all this information.

670
00:23:40.637 --> 00:23:42.522
I don't know what they were looking at.

671
00:23:43.975 --> 00:23:47.243
I guess what happened was is they had drank

672
00:23:47.243 --> 00:23:50.414
their own Kool-Aid and decided that,

673
00:23:50.414 --> 00:23:52.983
and confused, I should say,

674
00:23:52.983 --> 00:23:56.887
they confused rising asset prices with wealth.

675
00:23:56.887 --> 00:23:58.655
They said, "Houses are going up,

676
00:23:58.655 --> 00:24:00.223
"people are getting wealthier."

677
00:24:00.223 --> 00:24:01.526
It's not true.

678
00:24:01.526 --> 00:24:03.627
Wealth comes from productive enterprise

679
00:24:03.627 --> 00:24:05.062
where value is created.

680
00:24:05.062 --> 00:24:09.300
If you can sit in your house on your sofa drinking beer

681
00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.702
and get wealthy, it should tell you

682
00:24:11.702 --> 00:24:13.503
that something is wrong with the picture.

683
00:24:13.503 --> 00:24:14.671
<v Regina>And a lot of people thought</v>

684
00:24:14.671 --> 00:24:15.672
that's what was happening.

685
00:24:15.672 --> 00:24:17.375
And in fact, a lot of people took a second job

686
00:24:17.375 --> 00:24:19.242
as a real estate agent so that they could start

687
00:24:19.242 --> 00:24:22.278
snapping up properties and rehabbing and selling,

688
00:24:22.278 --> 00:24:24.181
flipping the houses, as it were.

689
00:24:24.181 --> 00:24:26.850
<v ->Wealth does not happen by magic or accident,</v>

690
00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:28.384
wealth happens because of hard work,

691
00:24:28.384 --> 00:24:31.422
and anytime you're in a system where it looks

692
00:24:31.422 --> 00:24:33.190
like wealth is coming out of nowhere,

693
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:35.059
you're in a bubble.

694
00:24:35.059 --> 00:24:36.727
<v Regina>And so, now what happens?</v>

695
00:24:36.727 --> 00:24:38.330
Now we're looking at the housing bubble

696
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:40.130
that has only begun to play out.

697
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:41.032
<v ->Mm-hmm.</v>

698
00:24:41.032 --> 00:24:42.066
<v Regina>Now what?</v>

699
00:24:42.066 --> 00:24:44.035
<v ->Well, in housing, I still think we've got</v>

700
00:24:44.035 --> 00:24:47.038
a quite a bit of downside left at this point in time.

701
00:24:47.038 --> 00:24:48.306
We have way too many houses,

702
00:24:48.306 --> 00:24:49.572
there's a lot of shadow inventory

703
00:24:49.572 --> 00:24:50.808
sitting on the banks' books

704
00:24:50.808 --> 00:24:52.142
that they haven't disposed of yet.

705
00:24:52.142 --> 00:24:53.644
We built way too many houses,

706
00:24:53.644 --> 00:24:55.112
and so it's just gonna take time

707
00:24:55.112 --> 00:24:57.349
for population to move into and inhabit those houses.

708
00:24:57.349 --> 00:25:00.517
And frankly, houses are still way overpriced

709
00:25:00.517 --> 00:25:02.286
compared to incomes in a lot of areas.

710
00:25:02.286 --> 00:25:04.254
Not all areas, there's plenty of areas in the country

711
00:25:04.254 --> 00:25:05.488
which are reasonably balanced,

712
00:25:05.488 --> 00:25:07.690
but quite a few of the metropolitan areas

713
00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:09.071
and the areas that ran the hardest

714
00:25:09.071 --> 00:25:13.197
are still badly overpriced relative to incomes.

715
00:25:13.197 --> 00:25:14.966
And so, one of two things happens:

716
00:25:14.966 --> 00:25:17.667
either incomes come up or house prices come down.

717
00:25:17.667 --> 00:25:19.003
Incomes aren't going anywhere.

718
00:25:19.003 --> 00:25:20.438
So that only leaves one player,

719
00:25:20.438 --> 00:25:21.806
the house prices are gonna come down.

720
00:25:21.806 --> 00:25:23.307
<v Regina>And you think they're gonna drop for,</v>

721
00:25:23.307 --> 00:25:26.845
as many as four, five, six more years?

722
00:25:26.845 --> 00:25:27.744
Something like that?

723
00:25:27.744 --> 00:25:28.578
<v ->Well, if it's a normal bubble burst,</v>

724
00:25:28.578 --> 00:25:30.514
it means it's gonna take about as long to burst

725
00:25:30.514 --> 00:25:32.017
as it took to inflate.

726
00:25:32.017 --> 00:25:33.449
So that means if we tag,

727
00:25:33.449 --> 00:25:34.751
it depends on where you start this one.

728
00:25:34.751 --> 00:25:37.589
I start it in 1998, roughly,

729
00:25:37.589 --> 00:25:41.092
peaked in 2006, so I think there's about eight years,

730
00:25:41.092 --> 00:25:43.929
so, yeah, I think we've got about 2014,

731
00:25:43.929 --> 00:25:47.131
somewhere in that zone, would be a reasonable guess.

732
00:25:47.131 --> 00:25:48.900
Of course it could go faster,

733
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.367
and it's not going faster because what we've done

734
00:25:51.367 --> 00:25:53.837
is the government has stepped in and bought mortgages,

735
00:25:53.837 --> 00:25:56.973
about a trillion and a quarter when they're done,

736
00:25:56.973 --> 00:25:58.642
and that's driven mortgage interest rates down,

737
00:25:58.642 --> 00:26:00.043
which helps support the price, right?

738
00:26:00.043 --> 00:26:02.480
If the mortgage rate is lower, people can pay more.

739
00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.148
And there's been an $8,000 tax credit that ran

740
00:26:05.148 --> 00:26:07.517
through December and then got extended.

741
00:26:07.517 --> 00:26:09.185
So these are all efforts

742
00:26:09.185 --> 00:26:11.254
to sort of keep house prices inflated up.

743
00:26:11.254 --> 00:26:13.392
And what that will do is serve to sort of extend

744
00:26:13.392 --> 00:26:16.293
the time it'll take to wash this out.

745
00:26:16.293 --> 00:26:18.562
But I haven't found any examples of any bubbles

746
00:26:18.562 --> 00:26:21.599
that have not run their course yet in history.

747
00:26:21.599 --> 00:26:23.300
Maybe this will be the first time,

748
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.968
but I think that's, you know,

749
00:26:24.968 --> 00:26:26.570
that's a terrible investment strategy.

750
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:27.905
Whenever somebody tells you,

751
00:26:27.905 --> 00:26:29.539
"This time it's gonna be different,"

752
00:26:29.539 --> 00:26:30.674
you know, just run.

753
00:26:30.674 --> 00:26:31.875
<v Regina>Just run, yeah,</v>

754
00:26:31.875 --> 00:26:34.378
because what I love about your crash course

755
00:26:34.378 --> 00:26:35.646
is everything's right there.

756
00:26:35.646 --> 00:26:37.382
You have it all in graphs, so you can,

757
00:26:37.382 --> 00:26:39.716
it's emblazoned on the brain

758
00:26:39.716 --> 00:26:41.918
what these patterns look like,

759
00:26:41.918 --> 00:26:43.621
and these bubble patterns look like.

760
00:26:43.621 --> 00:26:46.123
And every single one of them looks pretty much the same.

761
00:26:46.123 --> 00:26:50.761
I mean it's actually geometrically quite perfect in a sense.

762
00:26:50.761 --> 00:26:52.395
<v ->That beautiful symmetry on them.</v>

763
00:26:52.395 --> 00:26:53.463
<v Regina>Beautiful symmetry.</v>

764
00:26:53.463 --> 00:26:55.799
<v ->And what this symmetry reveals is</v>

765
00:26:55.799 --> 00:26:58.603
that financial bubbles and panics,

766
00:26:58.603 --> 00:27:00.638
they're sociological events.

767
00:27:00.638 --> 00:27:02.673
They're not financial events.

768
00:27:02.673 --> 00:27:05.109
They're not sophisticated outcomes

769
00:27:05.109 --> 00:27:09.312
of machines and logical thinking, it's people.

770
00:27:09.312 --> 00:27:11.849
It's people getting overly excited on one end,

771
00:27:11.849 --> 00:27:14.151
and getting overly unexcited on the other end.

772
00:27:14.151 --> 00:27:17.054
And this has been true for hundreds of years.

773
00:27:17.054 --> 00:27:19.089
And so there's nothing different about humans today

774
00:27:19.089 --> 00:27:21.257
than couple hundred years ago, we're just the same,

775
00:27:21.257 --> 00:27:23.760
programmed the same, operate the same.

776
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.163
And so I don't have anything in the data set at this point

777
00:27:27.163 --> 00:27:29.198
that would suggest to me this bubble burst

778
00:27:29.198 --> 00:27:30.766
is going to be any different.

779
00:27:30.766 --> 00:27:32.535
What's a little bit different this time

780
00:27:32.535 --> 00:27:36.339
is we're fighting it with a global armamentarium

781
00:27:36.339 --> 00:27:39.943
of free money, in essence, all the worlds' central banks

782
00:27:39.943 --> 00:27:42.145
have locked elbows and they're singing Kumbaya

783
00:27:42.145 --> 00:27:43.713
and they're hoping

784
00:27:43.713 --> 00:27:45.516
that they're gonna pull us out of this one.

785
00:27:45.516 --> 00:27:48.420
I have my doubts because all of history says

786
00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:51.922
that when you try and control an economy

787
00:27:51.922 --> 00:27:55.493
at the central level using big ugly levers,

788
00:27:55.493 --> 00:27:57.594
more money, cheaper, you know,

789
00:27:57.594 --> 00:27:59.664
these are just giant, blunt levers,

790
00:27:59.664 --> 00:28:02.432
they really don't have a good track record of working.

791
00:28:02.432 --> 00:28:03.767
And this is the thing that's most amazing to me,

792
00:28:03.767 --> 00:28:06.004
we have all these people who've seen,

793
00:28:06.004 --> 00:28:08.172
this is called Keynsian Monetary Philosophy,

794
00:28:08.172 --> 00:28:09.805
so the Keynes came to us, you know,

795
00:28:09.805 --> 00:28:11.509
the British economist in the 20s

796
00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:14.344
and the Keynesians truly believe

797
00:28:14.344 --> 00:28:17.281
that they can fix it this time,

798
00:28:17.281 --> 00:28:20.718
if only we do it better, quicker, more completely.

799
00:28:20.718 --> 00:28:21.852
We stopped to early last time.

800
00:28:21.852 --> 00:28:23.320
They have this whole litany of excuses

801
00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.588
for why they failed in the past,

802
00:28:24.588 --> 00:28:25.689
but they never stopped to look back

803
00:28:25.689 --> 00:28:27.558
and say, "We're batting zero."

804
00:28:27.558 --> 00:28:28.225
<v Regina>Right.</v>

805
00:28:28.225 --> 00:28:29.792
<v ->Maybe the philosophy is wrong.</v>

806
00:28:29.792 --> 00:28:32.528
Maybe it's not that we applied it wrong, right?

807
00:28:32.528 --> 00:28:33.797
It's almost as if we have a doctor

808
00:28:33.797 --> 00:28:35.806
that's killed every single patient they've ever seen.

809
00:28:35.806 --> 00:28:37.196
(Regina laughs)

810
00:28:37.196 --> 00:28:38.402
Well, I just put,

811
00:28:38.402 --> 00:28:41.138
I'm just gonna put the needle in somewhere else next time.

812
00:28:41.138 --> 00:28:43.573
You know, just say, stop.

813
00:28:43.573 --> 00:28:44.841
Just stop.

814
00:28:44.841 --> 00:28:47.777
<v Regina>(laughs) Okay, so let's talk</v>

815
00:28:47.777 --> 00:28:49.480
about some of the people that are bloodied

816
00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.381
in the streets, some of the women and men

817
00:28:51.381 --> 00:28:53.684
in this country who are now just working

818
00:28:53.684 --> 00:28:56.854
their tushes off to try to keep up with it.

819
00:28:56.854 --> 00:28:59.023
Maybe they got caught in the mortgage thing,

820
00:28:59.023 --> 00:29:01.157
maybe their mortgage is now double or triple

821
00:29:01.157 --> 00:29:03.427
what they were a year or two ago.

822
00:29:03.427 --> 00:29:05.194
Let's say their credit cards have been jacked up

823
00:29:05.194 --> 00:29:09.666
maybe to 30% from a starting point of 12 or 13.

824
00:29:09.666 --> 00:29:11.601
And there aren't enough hours in the day

825
00:29:11.601 --> 00:29:14.138
to keep the gig going anymore.

826
00:29:14.138 --> 00:29:16.073
What do you see happening?

827
00:29:16.073 --> 00:29:18.808
And I'm not asking you to give advice per se,

828
00:29:18.808 --> 00:29:21.779
but what really are the options?

829
00:29:21.779 --> 00:29:24.048
I mean, where do you just say, "I can't do it,

830
00:29:24.048 --> 00:29:26.850
"I'm going to have to let go of something."

831
00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:29.052
Looking at it on the large scale,

832
00:29:29.052 --> 00:29:30.721
where does a person first just let go,

833
00:29:30.721 --> 00:29:32.889
because they can't do it?

834
00:29:32.889 --> 00:29:33.823
<v ->Hm.</v>

835
00:29:33.823 --> 00:29:36.260
That's a great question.

836
00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:37.560
I have a lot of experience in this,

837
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:41.130
because my family and I took a very interesting turn

838
00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:42.666
in our lives based on this information

839
00:29:42.666 --> 00:29:44.667
that's in the crash course.

840
00:29:44.667 --> 00:29:46.335
I would advise anybody, just go watch that,

841
00:29:46.335 --> 00:29:48.372
it's more material than I could possibly

842
00:29:48.372 --> 00:29:50.173
ever sit down and articulate.

843
00:29:50.173 --> 00:29:51.475
That's the reason I created it,

844
00:29:51.475 --> 00:29:52.509
because I was tired of having

845
00:29:52.509 --> 00:29:54.745
these same conversations poorly.

846
00:29:54.745 --> 00:29:55.679
<v Regina>Right, well done.</v>

847
00:29:55.679 --> 00:29:56.648
<v ->It's hard to string it all together</v>

848
00:29:56.648 --> 00:29:58.064
in open conversation.

849
00:29:58.064 --> 00:30:00.817
So based on that information, though,

850
00:30:00.817 --> 00:30:02.786
my wife and I sat down, we looked at everything,

851
00:30:02.786 --> 00:30:04.587
we said, we have to fundamentally change our lives,

852
00:30:04.587 --> 00:30:07.224
so the before story, before I came into contact

853
00:30:07.224 --> 00:30:09.392
with this information, I'm a vice president of a company

854
00:30:09.392 --> 00:30:11.595
called SCIC, it's very large.

855
00:30:11.595 --> 00:30:14.530
I've got a five-bathroom house on the coast of Connecticut,

856
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:16.466
three young children, I'm 42 at the time

857
00:30:16.466 --> 00:30:18.302
I come to this conclusion.

858
00:30:18.302 --> 00:30:21.271
I got a boat in the slip, it's got two engines on it, right?

859
00:30:21.271 --> 00:30:23.138
<v Regina>You're living the dream, yes you are.</v>

860
00:30:23.138 --> 00:30:24.107
<v ->I'm living the dream, right?</v>

861
00:30:24.107 --> 00:30:26.476
Okay, now fast forward five years later

862
00:30:26.476 --> 00:30:28.244
after I came into contact with this information,

863
00:30:28.244 --> 00:30:31.548
we were renting a small house in rural Massachusetts,

864
00:30:31.548 --> 00:30:33.083
I don't have a boat in the slip anymore,

865
00:30:33.083 --> 00:30:36.086
I got a kayak with, you know, double paddle,

866
00:30:36.086 --> 00:30:39.589
so twin engines to double paddle, is my journey.

867
00:30:39.589 --> 00:30:41.024
We've taken our kids out of school,

868
00:30:41.024 --> 00:30:42.860
and we're home schooling them at this point,

869
00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.028
because the kinds of adjectives

870
00:30:45.028 --> 00:30:46.798
by which we want to describe our children

871
00:30:46.798 --> 00:30:49.466
were not the ones that public school in our area

872
00:30:49.466 --> 00:30:51.634
was creating, and we want creative,

873
00:30:51.634 --> 00:30:54.904
independent, adaptable individuals.

874
00:30:54.904 --> 00:30:56.141
<v Regina>People that still have sovereign minds</v>

875
00:30:56.141 --> 00:30:57.175
when they grow up.

876
00:30:57.175 --> 00:30:58.976
<v ->Absolutely, the answers come from here,</v>

877
00:30:58.976 --> 00:31:00.209
not the front of the room.

878
00:31:00.209 --> 00:31:02.613
And so we made all of those changes.

879
00:31:02.613 --> 00:31:05.414
And when I stepped off that particular train

880
00:31:05.414 --> 00:31:07.450
at that point in time, I had nothing in front of me.

881
00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:10.486
I did not quit my job as a vice president,

882
00:31:10.486 --> 00:31:12.856
saying, "And I know what I'm gonna do next."

883
00:31:12.856 --> 00:31:14.817
I had no idea.

884
00:31:14.817 --> 00:31:16.840
My situation's different, I guess,

885
00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.196
because I had a very supportive wife,

886
00:31:19.196 --> 00:31:20.797
and we were in alignment on these things,

887
00:31:20.797 --> 00:31:23.106
and I recognize that not everybody has that.

888
00:31:24.636 --> 00:31:26.636
I had some savings, because I have always been a saver,

889
00:31:26.636 --> 00:31:27.838
and I believed in that.

890
00:31:27.838 --> 00:31:29.706
So we had a cushion to operate with for a while,

891
00:31:29.706 --> 00:31:32.743
but really it was a big step off into the unknown.

892
00:31:32.743 --> 00:31:34.110
So here's the summation.

893
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:36.412
We cut our standard of living in half

894
00:31:36.412 --> 00:31:38.248
by conventional standards.

895
00:31:38.248 --> 00:31:40.550
But our quality of life doubled.

896
00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.052
<v Regina>Talk about that part.</v>

897
00:31:42.052 --> 00:31:45.323
<v ->Well, what I found out is that</v>

898
00:31:45.323 --> 00:31:47.758
the dream I was living was really an illusion.

899
00:31:47.758 --> 00:31:49.325
I was working really hard.

900
00:31:49.325 --> 00:31:50.393
I was gone all the time.

901
00:31:50.393 --> 00:31:52.763
I was, in my job, I was on a plane

902
00:31:52.763 --> 00:31:55.399
from Monday to Thursday every week.

903
00:31:55.399 --> 00:31:58.936
And then I was always working when I got home anyway.

904
00:31:58.936 --> 00:32:01.605
So I was really missing out on life.

905
00:32:01.605 --> 00:32:04.140
You know, I was very successful at what I did at work,

906
00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.944
but, not, maybe, successful in being around my kids

907
00:32:06.944 --> 00:32:07.777
watching them grow up.

908
00:32:07.777 --> 00:32:12.482
So here I am, now, have tons of time to spend with my kids,

909
00:32:12.482 --> 00:32:14.317
because I don't have all this stuff that I have to maintain.

910
00:32:14.317 --> 00:32:15.685
I don't have to work that hard, 'cause I have

911
00:32:15.685 --> 00:32:19.588
a lot less things that I really have to attend to,

912
00:32:19.588 --> 00:32:21.858
from a material standpoint.

913
00:32:21.858 --> 00:32:24.194
We made a conscious effort to move in community,

914
00:32:24.194 --> 00:32:25.762
and find community with the understanding

915
00:32:25.762 --> 00:32:27.363
that we wanted to be in deep relationship

916
00:32:27.363 --> 00:32:30.767
with people, because whatever future comes,

917
00:32:30.767 --> 00:32:33.135
it's good to know people really deeply.

918
00:32:33.135 --> 00:32:34.505
So we wanted to share experiences

919
00:32:34.505 --> 00:32:37.241
with people that would go well beyond

920
00:32:37.241 --> 00:32:39.976
the normal chatter at parties and things like that.

921
00:32:39.976 --> 00:32:42.512
And so we found, we picked up and moved.

922
00:32:42.512 --> 00:32:43.813
This was my wife's genius moment.

923
00:32:43.813 --> 00:32:46.317
She said, "Let's go to a place which already has stuff

924
00:32:46.317 --> 00:32:48.552
"like this, rather than trying to create it

925
00:32:48.552 --> 00:32:49.320
"where we were living."

926
00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.320
'Cause where we lived

927
00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.955
was a suburban sterile bedroom community.

928
00:32:51.955 --> 00:32:53.423
And we looked around and said,

929
00:32:53.423 --> 00:32:54.458
"I don't know how to do this."

930
00:32:54.458 --> 00:32:56.227
So, and it's not here, so we moved to where it was,

931
00:32:56.227 --> 00:32:58.328
and best decision ever.

932
00:32:58.328 --> 00:33:01.865
And so now we have a really tight circle of friends

933
00:33:01.865 --> 00:33:05.001
and it's growing all the time.

934
00:33:05.001 --> 00:33:07.971
We live in a house which we ended up buying eventually,

935
00:33:07.971 --> 00:33:09.507
which, can now, you know,

936
00:33:09.507 --> 00:33:11.106
whatever happens with the energy situation,

937
00:33:11.106 --> 00:33:12.443
it'll always be warm.

938
00:33:12.443 --> 00:33:14.009
You know, we have five ways of heating the house

939
00:33:14.009 --> 00:33:15.212
if we need to.

940
00:33:15.212 --> 00:33:17.314
We can grow some of our own food.

941
00:33:17.314 --> 00:33:19.750
We just found that we could start to be in relationship

942
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:22.418
with the things that we had formerly been

943
00:33:22.418 --> 00:33:24.487
completely dependent on outside.

944
00:33:24.487 --> 00:33:26.856
All of the systems, from energy to food,

945
00:33:26.856 --> 00:33:28.958
to even medicine, to our entertainment,

946
00:33:28.958 --> 00:33:30.593
we took all responsibility of bringing

947
00:33:30.593 --> 00:33:32.796
all of these things back into our lives.

948
00:33:32.796 --> 00:33:34.531
And I'll be honest with you,

949
00:33:34.531 --> 00:33:36.966
we first started doing that out of fear.

950
00:33:36.966 --> 00:33:38.969
We came at this originally saying,

951
00:33:38.969 --> 00:33:41.804
"Oh my gosh, we feel exposed,

952
00:33:41.804 --> 00:33:43.205
"this is the wrong community,

953
00:33:43.205 --> 00:33:44.241
"we have to be somewhere else."

954
00:33:44.241 --> 00:33:45.742
And there was fear on that.

955
00:33:45.742 --> 00:33:46.809
But once we got there,

956
00:33:46.809 --> 00:33:48.479
we realized there was this huge carrot,

957
00:33:48.479 --> 00:33:49.793
that we didn't even know was there.

958
00:33:49.793 --> 00:33:50.893
It was hidden from us.

959
00:33:50.893 --> 00:33:51.784
<v Regina>Oh, yeah, it's just wonderful.</v>

960
00:33:51.784 --> 00:33:53.435
<v ->How did we miss this?</v>

961
00:33:53.435 --> 00:33:55.785
<v Regina>So much more satisfying a lifestyle.</v>

962
00:33:55.785 --> 00:33:57.488
<v ->Absolutely, absolutely.</v>

963
00:33:57.488 --> 00:33:59.557
So we know that this is possible,

964
00:33:59.557 --> 00:34:01.493
that you can really reduce your standard of living

965
00:34:01.493 --> 00:34:03.059
and come out better.

966
00:34:03.059 --> 00:34:05.928
But the things that you care about have to shift

967
00:34:05.928 --> 00:34:08.464
and what your values are have to shift,

968
00:34:08.464 --> 00:34:09.866
and that takes time.

969
00:34:09.866 --> 00:34:11.902
I've been on this journey for five years now,

970
00:34:11.902 --> 00:34:13.771
and I don't know how to tell anybody

971
00:34:13.771 --> 00:34:15.239
how to speed it up.

972
00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:17.206
I wish I'd learned a lot of things where I could say,

973
00:34:17.206 --> 00:34:18.607
"I can tell you how to do this in two months."

974
00:34:18.607 --> 00:34:20.810
'Cause it just takes time, it really does.

975
00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:21.911
<v Regina>It's a process.</v>

976
00:34:21.911 --> 00:34:24.415
<v ->Just to get, just to get control of your finances.</v>

977
00:34:24.415 --> 00:34:25.816
There's a whole body of work there.

978
00:34:25.816 --> 00:34:27.617
Let's imagine you got a 401(k) over here,

979
00:34:27.617 --> 00:34:28.784
you've got a broker over there,

980
00:34:28.784 --> 00:34:29.886
and you've got a couple of accounts,

981
00:34:29.886 --> 00:34:31.722
maybe there's an annuity, and then there's an inheritance.

982
00:34:31.722 --> 00:34:34.103
Just to get all of that assembled

983
00:34:34.103 --> 00:34:36.693
and get your arms around it so you're in control of it,

984
00:34:36.693 --> 00:34:37.795
it just takes time.

985
00:34:37.795 --> 00:34:39.630
you wouldn't believe the rules that exist

986
00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:41.666
to prevent you from getting access to your money.

987
00:34:41.666 --> 00:34:42.326
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

988
00:34:42.326 --> 00:34:44.201
<v ->So financially, there might be a bunch of steps to take</v>

989
00:34:44.201 --> 00:34:46.236
just to control it, and then to figure out

990
00:34:46.236 --> 00:34:47.737
how to cut your expenses,

991
00:34:47.737 --> 00:34:50.506
and then there's, you know, that takes time.

992
00:34:50.506 --> 00:34:53.009
Physically, if you're gonna move and start a garden

993
00:34:53.009 --> 00:34:56.011
or, you know, gain some skills or all of these other things,

994
00:34:56.011 --> 00:34:57.380
it just takes time.

995
00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:58.681
And then emotionally.

996
00:34:58.681 --> 00:35:01.118
That's the last area where it just takes time

997
00:35:01.118 --> 00:35:03.952
to sort of cleave the sense of knowing

998
00:35:03.952 --> 00:35:05.021
how the future is gonna be.

999
00:35:05.021 --> 00:35:07.190
Like, my daughter's gonna go to the same college

1000
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:09.359
I went to and have the same opportunities.

1001
00:35:09.359 --> 00:35:11.460
But maybe not.

1002
00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.596
And that's okay, she might have better opportunities,

1003
00:35:13.596 --> 00:35:16.532
but I had a sense that I knew what it was gonna look like,

1004
00:35:16.532 --> 00:35:18.167
and letting go of that sense,

1005
00:35:18.167 --> 00:35:19.601
it just took time.

1006
00:35:19.601 --> 00:35:23.206
And so, all of these things, and to anybody I counsel,

1007
00:35:23.206 --> 00:35:26.976
get started, there's no time like the present,

1008
00:35:26.976 --> 00:35:29.545
these changes are coming, I'm just so convinced

1009
00:35:29.545 --> 00:35:30.915
that big changes are coming.

1010
00:35:30.915 --> 00:35:33.483
So start to figure out what are the things

1011
00:35:33.483 --> 00:35:35.553
that you can do to add

1012
00:35:35.553 --> 00:35:39.055
greater resilience into your life, today?

1013
00:35:39.055 --> 00:35:41.037
And that's a different answer for everybody.

1014
00:35:41.037 --> 00:35:43.158
<v Regina>And what about for people</v>

1015
00:35:43.158 --> 00:35:44.995
who haven't really taken all these things

1016
00:35:44.995 --> 00:35:48.899
into consideration, and are now being whipped around

1017
00:35:48.899 --> 00:35:52.602
by the effect of what's going on

1018
00:35:52.602 --> 00:35:55.671
economically at large, and are not really

1019
00:35:55.671 --> 00:35:59.409
in a power position and don't have any 401(k) anymore?

1020
00:35:59.409 --> 00:36:01.945
And now we're looking at losing our credit rating

1021
00:36:01.945 --> 00:36:05.815
because we have to bail on something, right?

1022
00:36:05.815 --> 00:36:07.617
How's that work?

1023
00:36:07.617 --> 00:36:09.286
<v ->I wish there was an easy answer for that,</v>

1024
00:36:09.286 --> 00:36:11.053
and there really isn't at this point in time.

1025
00:36:11.053 --> 00:36:12.589
The key understanding for me is

1026
00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:17.261
that the failing here is in our monetary system.

1027
00:36:17.261 --> 00:36:20.662
It's in the active process of no longer serving us.

1028
00:36:20.662 --> 00:36:23.799
We are now in service to our monetary system,

1029
00:36:23.799 --> 00:36:25.235
our debt structure.

1030
00:36:25.235 --> 00:36:28.672
And that story is starting to break down,

1031
00:36:28.672 --> 00:36:30.541
and that's a deeply unsettling time,

1032
00:36:30.541 --> 00:36:34.410
and the transition between the system functioning

1033
00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:37.981
and not functioning is really gonna be unstable,

1034
00:36:37.981 --> 00:36:41.151
possibly unpleasant, and the only thing

1035
00:36:41.151 --> 00:36:43.453
that I have found that makes sense to me

1036
00:36:43.453 --> 00:36:46.156
is to start disconnecting from the system,

1037
00:36:46.156 --> 00:36:47.758
from the money system itself,

1038
00:36:47.758 --> 00:36:49.559
and connecting with the people system.

1039
00:36:49.559 --> 00:36:50.327
<v Regina>So what happens?</v>

1040
00:36:50.327 --> 00:36:51.528
Does that mean, I mean, in some cases

1041
00:36:51.528 --> 00:36:53.362
people will have to walk away from debts

1042
00:36:53.362 --> 00:36:54.899
that they can no longer service

1043
00:36:54.899 --> 00:36:56.432
and then the credit's gone,

1044
00:36:56.432 --> 00:36:58.001
their potential for credit's gone.

1045
00:36:58.001 --> 00:36:59.135
<v ->That's a business decision.</v>

1046
00:36:59.135 --> 00:37:00.269
Businesses do that all the time.

1047
00:37:00.269 --> 00:37:02.273
I really reject the notion where I see it painted

1048
00:37:02.273 --> 00:37:03.839
all the time where they're trying to say it's a moral,

1049
00:37:03.839 --> 00:37:06.375
you have a moral obligation to pay your mortgage back.

1050
00:37:06.375 --> 00:37:08.911
No, it's a contract, it's a business decision.

1051
00:37:08.911 --> 00:37:10.012
It's all stipulated.

1052
00:37:10.012 --> 00:37:11.915
There's language in there, if there was a clause in there

1053
00:37:11.915 --> 00:37:13.583
that said, you have a moral obligation to pay,

1054
00:37:13.583 --> 00:37:15.118
I would change my tune, but there isn't.

1055
00:37:15.118 --> 00:37:19.255
It's just business, and businesses do it all the time.

1056
00:37:19.255 --> 00:37:20.824
We're in San Francisco now, well,

1057
00:37:20.824 --> 00:37:23.835
Morgan Stanley walked away from a gigantic, you know,

1058
00:37:23.835 --> 00:37:25.394
building that they had.

1059
00:37:25.394 --> 00:37:27.331
Morgan Stanley, they could pay.

1060
00:37:27.331 --> 00:37:28.532
They said, "It doesn't make sense."

1061
00:37:28.532 --> 00:37:29.265
So they didn't.

1062
00:37:29.265 --> 00:37:30.100
They terminated the--

1063
00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.334
<v Regina>And yet the average person beats themselves up</v>

1064
00:37:32.334 --> 00:37:34.371
thinking, "Well, I did charge those things,

1065
00:37:34.371 --> 00:37:36.472
"but now my card's up to 15,000

1066
00:37:36.472 --> 00:37:38.141
"and they've ratcheted the rate up,

1067
00:37:38.141 --> 00:37:39.241
"I can't take it anymore,

1068
00:37:39.241 --> 00:37:40.743
"I can't pay it, I don't have the money

1069
00:37:40.743 --> 00:37:42.344
"or else I can't pay my heat,

1070
00:37:42.344 --> 00:37:45.181
"or my heating bill, or electric bill, or whatnot."

1071
00:37:45.181 --> 00:37:48.217
So this whole thing where we really come down hard

1072
00:37:48.217 --> 00:37:51.921
on ourselves as individuals in terms of the morality

1073
00:37:51.921 --> 00:37:56.458
and ethics of money, debt, and obligation,

1074
00:37:56.458 --> 00:37:58.361
that's very interesting what you said,

1075
00:37:58.361 --> 00:38:00.296
"This is a business decision."

1076
00:38:00.296 --> 00:38:01.597
<v ->Well, it is.</v>

1077
00:38:01.597 --> 00:38:03.766
I would also, let me give a little bit of counsel,

1078
00:38:03.766 --> 00:38:07.136
that is people are running up debts

1079
00:38:07.136 --> 00:38:09.605
and know that they're living beyond their means,

1080
00:38:09.605 --> 00:38:11.507
that always ends in tears.

1081
00:38:11.507 --> 00:38:12.302
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1082
00:38:12.302 --> 00:38:14.109
<v ->Everybody should endeavor to live within their means,</v>

1083
00:38:14.109 --> 00:38:15.277
whatever those are.

1084
00:38:15.277 --> 00:38:18.214
And so, that's, that actually makes sense,

1085
00:38:18.214 --> 00:38:20.450
but sometimes circumstances happen.

1086
00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:22.384
You know, if you moved out here,

1087
00:38:22.384 --> 00:38:24.654
and you had to buy a house for a variety of reasons,

1088
00:38:24.654 --> 00:38:26.823
and they just happened to have been in bubble territory,

1089
00:38:26.823 --> 00:38:29.526
because of Federal Reserve policies,

1090
00:38:29.526 --> 00:38:31.060
and you got caught on that,

1091
00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:34.030
now you're facing a business decision, right?

1092
00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:34.964
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1093
00:38:34.964 --> 00:38:37.334
<v ->But if you're MO is to go out and constantly spend more</v>

1094
00:38:37.334 --> 00:38:39.502
than you earn, that's different.

1095
00:38:39.502 --> 00:38:40.703
<v Regina>Back to morals and ethics.</v>

1096
00:38:40.703 --> 00:38:43.806
Then you're certainly on the border of territory.

1097
00:38:43.806 --> 00:38:46.008
<v ->Your border territory, I don't think is very wise,</v>

1098
00:38:46.008 --> 00:38:48.110
for personal, like if I was going to personally coach

1099
00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:49.378
somebody who was spending beyond their means,

1100
00:38:49.378 --> 00:38:51.214
I'd say, "Stop," you know, just don't.

1101
00:38:51.214 --> 00:38:53.083
<v Regina>Don't do that.</v>

1102
00:38:53.083 --> 00:38:54.584
Now, let's get into an area

1103
00:38:54.584 --> 00:38:56.652
that is a lot of people have their eye on

1104
00:38:56.652 --> 00:38:57.687
for a variety of reasons,

1105
00:38:57.687 --> 00:38:59.055
I mean, headlines recently,

1106
00:38:59.055 --> 00:39:01.591
or Google threatens to pull out of China,

1107
00:39:01.591 --> 00:39:03.527
and China's rattling their sabers,

1108
00:39:03.527 --> 00:39:06.462
and there's a lot of upset, no one really knows

1109
00:39:06.462 --> 00:39:08.931
what this will mean in the markets and such.

1110
00:39:08.931 --> 00:39:11.100
But let's talk about the year of the tiger,

1111
00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:13.302
you wrote a blog on it.

1112
00:39:13.302 --> 00:39:15.004
Coming into the year of the tiger

1113
00:39:15.004 --> 00:39:17.674
and the relationship between China

1114
00:39:17.674 --> 00:39:18.909
and the rest of the world,

1115
00:39:18.909 --> 00:39:21.277
and some of what they're doing there

1116
00:39:21.277 --> 00:39:24.414
to prepare for their future where other parts

1117
00:39:24.414 --> 00:39:26.382
of the world are dropping the ball.

1118
00:39:26.382 --> 00:39:28.250
<v ->Absolutely this is a huge story.</v>

1119
00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:30.186
What I am, I'm an information scout.

1120
00:39:30.186 --> 00:39:31.354
That's how I think of myself.

1121
00:39:31.354 --> 00:39:33.122
And I go out there and I sniff around,

1122
00:39:33.122 --> 00:39:34.224
and I find something of interest,

1123
00:39:34.224 --> 00:39:35.624
and I'll start gathering more of them,

1124
00:39:35.624 --> 00:39:37.793
and it, a couple weeks back, I realized I had

1125
00:39:37.793 --> 00:39:41.699
this huge basket of nuts, and they all said China on them.

1126
00:39:41.699 --> 00:39:43.199
And I started looking, and I was like,

1127
00:39:43.199 --> 00:39:44.701
"Ooh, what's going on here?"

1128
00:39:44.701 --> 00:39:46.836
So, as you know, if you watch the crash course,

1129
00:39:46.836 --> 00:39:48.738
I have this belief that we're running out of a couple

1130
00:39:48.738 --> 00:39:52.842
of key resources, that this, I'm gonna be alive

1131
00:39:52.842 --> 00:39:54.812
during one of the most critical transformations

1132
00:39:54.812 --> 00:39:57.248
in all of humanity which will be the first time ever

1133
00:39:57.248 --> 00:40:00.916
in human existence collectively, across the globe,

1134
00:40:00.916 --> 00:40:02.184
we're gonna have slightly less

1135
00:40:02.184 --> 00:40:05.523
of some resources going forward, not more,

1136
00:40:05.523 --> 00:40:06.757
oil being the chief one.

1137
00:40:06.757 --> 00:40:09.225
But once you go past peak oil, you're at peak everything

1138
00:40:09.225 --> 00:40:11.294
at that point, because we use oil to extract copper

1139
00:40:11.294 --> 00:40:13.228
and move the bauxite around

1140
00:40:13.228 --> 00:40:16.333
and get the ore for iron and everything.

1141
00:40:16.333 --> 00:40:20.771
So, I'm watching this story of peak oil coming really fast

1142
00:40:20.771 --> 00:40:23.806
and wondering if I was in charge, like if I was

1143
00:40:23.806 --> 00:40:27.109
in charge of the U.S. right now, I'd be on a crash program

1144
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:30.781
of both hoarding resources, accumulating them,

1145
00:40:30.781 --> 00:40:33.850
and saving them up, and acquiring them.

1146
00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:36.351
Because I want my nation to have that security,

1147
00:40:36.351 --> 00:40:38.788
because you need resources to have an economy,

1148
00:40:38.788 --> 00:40:40.724
not the other way around.

1149
00:40:40.724 --> 00:40:42.459
Well, when I started looking at this basket

1150
00:40:42.459 --> 00:40:44.395
with all the China nuts in it, I realized that

1151
00:40:44.395 --> 00:40:46.963
all of them said some version of China is taking

1152
00:40:46.963 --> 00:40:49.167
its checkbook and going across the world.

1153
00:40:49.167 --> 00:40:52.035
I have stories about China buying oil rights in Canada,

1154
00:40:52.035 --> 00:40:55.939
timber rights in Canada, all sorts of grains out of Brazil,

1155
00:40:55.939 --> 00:40:58.498
a huge oil deal with Venezuela,

1156
00:40:58.498 --> 00:41:01.278
land in Africa for agriculture,

1157
00:41:01.278 --> 00:41:03.414
they're doing all kinds of ordeals in Africa,

1158
00:41:03.414 --> 00:41:05.414
they're basically all over the globe

1159
00:41:05.414 --> 00:41:07.483
running a mercantilist policy with their checkbook

1160
00:41:07.483 --> 00:41:08.584
of just buying this stuff.

1161
00:41:08.584 --> 00:41:10.053
And they're thinking huge deals.

1162
00:41:10.053 --> 00:41:12.555
They're giant in their long-term.

1163
00:41:12.555 --> 00:41:16.160
They did a 25-year gas deal with Iran,

1164
00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.828
a big, giant, multi-decade deal.

1165
00:41:18.828 --> 00:41:21.309
And when I look at that through one filter,

1166
00:41:21.309 --> 00:41:22.965
you could say, "Oh, this is just Chinese companies

1167
00:41:22.965 --> 00:41:24.599
"out competing, and maybe they're overpaying,

1168
00:41:24.599 --> 00:41:26.937
"haha, they're gonna have bad luck with that."

1169
00:41:26.937 --> 00:41:29.705
But it actually starts looking more like a state policy

1170
00:41:29.705 --> 00:41:31.475
of encouraging and allowing the businesses

1171
00:41:31.475 --> 00:41:34.077
that exist in China to go out and secure resources

1172
00:41:34.077 --> 00:41:35.344
and bring them back.

1173
00:41:35.344 --> 00:41:38.549
China doubled its imports of copper this year.

1174
00:41:38.549 --> 00:41:41.016
It can't be because they needed it economically.

1175
00:41:41.016 --> 00:41:43.152
The economy, in case you hadn't noticed, is tanking, right?

1176
00:41:43.152 --> 00:41:45.122
So China's exports have tanked,

1177
00:41:45.122 --> 00:41:47.722
but still they're importing ingots of copper

1178
00:41:47.722 --> 00:41:49.559
as fast as they possibly can.

1179
00:41:49.559 --> 00:41:52.094
This starts to look like a story of hoarding,

1180
00:41:52.094 --> 00:41:53.596
it starts to look like a story of a country

1181
00:41:53.596 --> 00:41:57.767
that understands that there's a resource limitation coming,

1182
00:41:57.767 --> 00:41:58.835
maybe not this quarter,

1183
00:41:58.835 --> 00:42:01.538
maybe not by the next election cycle in U.S. politics,

1184
00:42:01.538 --> 00:42:03.272
but certainly in the next decade.

1185
00:42:03.272 --> 00:42:04.608
<v Regina>And that's a good point.</v>

1186
00:42:04.608 --> 00:42:06.742
We go as far as the next election cycle.

1187
00:42:06.742 --> 00:42:08.210
<v ->Well, yet, corporate, you know,</v>

1188
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:09.412
from a corporate standpoint, we ought to go

1189
00:42:09.412 --> 00:42:12.415
to the next earning statement, or the year annual statement,

1190
00:42:12.415 --> 00:42:14.784
or we go politically to the next election.

1191
00:42:14.784 --> 00:42:16.986
So we're on this really short, short cycle.

1192
00:42:16.986 --> 00:42:18.687
And China's on a longer cycle, right.

1193
00:42:18.687 --> 00:42:19.889
They don't actually hold elections,

1194
00:42:19.889 --> 00:42:22.591
so they are free to think in different ways.

1195
00:42:22.591 --> 00:42:24.227
And the Chinese Premiere is actually

1196
00:42:24.227 --> 00:42:27.230
incredibly well educated and an incredibly smart man,

1197
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:29.398
and so all of these concepts are certainly well

1198
00:42:29.398 --> 00:42:31.700
within his capability to grasp.

1199
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:33.670
So, when I look at this, it occurs to me

1200
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:38.041
that it looks like China's already off of the racing blocks.

1201
00:42:38.041 --> 00:42:40.510
And the United States doesn't even know

1202
00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:41.745
that there's a race being run.

1203
00:42:41.745 --> 00:42:43.445
<v Regina>Yeah, yeah.</v>

1204
00:42:43.445 --> 00:42:45.382
It would look like that.

1205
00:42:45.382 --> 00:42:46.949
<v ->Right, and maybe we've got a different strategy</v>

1206
00:42:46.949 --> 00:42:48.284
but I think it's an old strategy.

1207
00:42:48.284 --> 00:42:49.385
Here's the old strategy:

1208
00:42:49.385 --> 00:42:51.756
We have more boats with missiles on them than you do,

1209
00:42:51.756 --> 00:42:53.056
so if we have to, we'll be able

1210
00:42:53.056 --> 00:42:54.457
to get access to your materials.

1211
00:42:54.457 --> 00:42:56.525
<v Regina>That's so primitive, really.</v>

1212
00:42:56.525 --> 00:42:57.460
<v ->Well, it is primitive,</v>

1213
00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:59.262
but the problem is that most of these things now,

1214
00:42:59.262 --> 00:43:00.863
like, consider oil.

1215
00:43:00.863 --> 00:43:02.298
So here we are, we're saber rattling

1216
00:43:02.298 --> 00:43:04.834
with both Yemen and with Iran, and of course,

1217
00:43:04.834 --> 00:43:07.069
we've already been in Afghanistan, and Iraq,

1218
00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:08.904
and Kazakhstan, so we've basically got

1219
00:43:08.904 --> 00:43:10.540
the whole region surrounded.

1220
00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:13.343
There's oil under every terrorist, magically.

1221
00:43:13.343 --> 00:43:16.745
And, so what that's gonna translate into

1222
00:43:16.745 --> 00:43:18.880
is we think that we're gonna have access to that oil

1223
00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.184
because we've got the boats.

1224
00:43:21.184 --> 00:43:23.086
Well, that might be true, but the problem is

1225
00:43:23.086 --> 00:43:25.421
that that oil has to get to us by boat.

1226
00:43:25.421 --> 00:43:28.191
We put it in these big, giant tankers,

1227
00:43:28.191 --> 00:43:30.960
and they start trundling along at about four knots,

1228
00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.661
and in case you hadn't noticed, that's really slow.

1229
00:43:32.661 --> 00:43:34.129
These things are explosive.

1230
00:43:34.129 --> 00:43:36.831
And to try and protect

1231
00:43:36.831 --> 00:43:40.135
a 12,000-mile shipping line

1232
00:43:40.135 --> 00:43:42.739
from random acts of violence, terrorists,

1233
00:43:42.739 --> 00:43:46.242
let alone state-sponsored warfare is impossible,

1234
00:43:46.242 --> 00:43:48.476
because offense is so much cheaper to run

1235
00:43:48.476 --> 00:43:50.213
than defense on these things.

1236
00:43:50.213 --> 00:43:52.081
Remember, you know, even in the Falklands War,

1237
00:43:52.081 --> 00:43:54.465
what was that '82 between Britain and Argentina,

1238
00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:56.652
there were these French Exocet missiles

1239
00:43:56.652 --> 00:43:58.654
that just created huge enormous troubles

1240
00:43:58.654 --> 00:43:59.688
for the British navy.

1241
00:43:59.688 --> 00:44:02.724
That was in 1982, things have gone way beyond that now.

1242
00:44:02.724 --> 00:44:05.428
So, it just says that I don't strategically,

1243
00:44:05.428 --> 00:44:07.865
if I'm looking at this, I don't think it makes sense

1244
00:44:07.865 --> 00:44:11.234
to count on the fact that we're gonna be able

1245
00:44:11.234 --> 00:44:12.669
to protect oil shipments

1246
00:44:12.669 --> 00:44:15.438
from the Middle East using violent means.

1247
00:44:15.438 --> 00:44:17.186
And China has come to that same,

1248
00:44:17.186 --> 00:44:18.607
first of all, they have a land bridge to that,

1249
00:44:18.607 --> 00:44:19.643
so that's a different story for them.

1250
00:44:19.643 --> 00:44:22.178
But they're using checkbooks

1251
00:44:22.178 --> 00:44:23.613
and we're using gunboats.

1252
00:44:23.613 --> 00:44:25.514
And between those two strategies right now,

1253
00:44:25.514 --> 00:44:28.384
I think one of them has a better chance of success,

1254
00:44:28.384 --> 00:44:30.687
and I'm really worried about the fact

1255
00:44:30.687 --> 00:44:32.555
that if we are relying on military

1256
00:44:32.555 --> 00:44:35.024
as the way that we're gonna preserve and protect,

1257
00:44:35.024 --> 00:44:38.561
we need, we might find ourselves pretty badly disappointed

1258
00:44:38.561 --> 00:44:41.030
at some point in the future with that.

1259
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:43.932
<v Regina>Um, yeah, it would seem</v>

1260
00:44:43.932 --> 00:44:46.237
we're, that we're not,

1261
00:44:46.237 --> 00:44:47.669
well we've never been known

1262
00:44:47.669 --> 00:44:49.638
for our long-term thinking anyway.

1263
00:44:49.638 --> 00:44:51.674
I mean, even just looking at the savings stats

1264
00:44:51.674 --> 00:44:54.344
of China, the Chinese population in general.

1265
00:44:54.344 --> 00:44:56.278
Here we like to sit and point fingers

1266
00:44:56.278 --> 00:44:58.013
because we're in a sense,

1267
00:44:58.013 --> 00:44:59.782
we've got a little sour grapes thing going on

1268
00:44:59.782 --> 00:45:02.151
between the East and the West, no doubt about it.

1269
00:45:02.151 --> 00:45:04.554
But the reality is you're talking about a population

1270
00:45:04.554 --> 00:45:06.755
of people that knows how to think long-term,

1271
00:45:06.755 --> 00:45:08.424
a government that thinks long-term,

1272
00:45:08.424 --> 00:45:11.193
people that are willing to sacrifice now,

1273
00:45:11.193 --> 00:45:13.662
some pleasures of now for the future,

1274
00:45:13.662 --> 00:45:16.466
and their savings are what, 30%?

1275
00:45:16.466 --> 00:45:18.334
And have historically been around 30%

1276
00:45:18.334 --> 00:45:21.571
compared to in the good days, 10% in the West.

1277
00:45:21.571 --> 00:45:24.707
And now we're at, what, minus 10%?

1278
00:45:24.707 --> 00:45:27.009
<v ->It's really, we were most recently at,</v>

1279
00:45:27.009 --> 00:45:28.978
they said, four or 5%, but we went

1280
00:45:28.978 --> 00:45:31.213
as low as 1/2%.

1281
00:45:31.213 --> 00:45:33.617
But once you look at how we count savings,

1282
00:45:33.617 --> 00:45:35.284
it's actually a lot less than that.

1283
00:45:35.284 --> 00:45:36.419
<v Regina>Yeah, yeah.</v>

1284
00:45:36.419 --> 00:45:37.654
<v ->A little fudging going on there.</v>

1285
00:45:37.654 --> 00:45:40.790
<v Regina>So China's preparing for their future.</v>

1286
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:43.292
And we think that we can do it by might still?

1287
00:45:43.292 --> 00:45:46.396
That's a sad commentary.

1288
00:45:46.396 --> 00:45:49.265
<v ->Well, I understand how these things sort of develop.</v>

1289
00:45:49.265 --> 00:45:52.267
It's not just us, I think we've got all of NATO

1290
00:45:52.267 --> 00:45:55.003
is kind of pursuing the same strategy at this point.

1291
00:45:55.003 --> 00:45:56.438
<v Regina>It's still not a good strategy.</v>

1292
00:45:56.438 --> 00:45:58.240
<v ->I've asked eight people recently</v>

1293
00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.674
why are we in Afghanistan?

1294
00:45:59.674 --> 00:46:03.146
And without, once you take the resource war possibility

1295
00:46:03.146 --> 00:46:05.647
out of the picture, nobody can explain why we're there.

1296
00:46:05.647 --> 00:46:08.083
You know, there's no real clear reason,

1297
00:46:08.083 --> 00:46:09.318
but once you start to look at

1298
00:46:09.318 --> 00:46:11.052
where the resources are concentrated,

1299
00:46:11.052 --> 00:46:12.922
and you look at where U.S. troops are concentrated,

1300
00:46:12.922 --> 00:46:16.091
the story becomes absolutely crystal clear.

1301
00:46:16.091 --> 00:46:17.527
Or at least there's enough correlation there

1302
00:46:17.527 --> 00:46:19.128
that there's smoke all over the story.

1303
00:46:19.128 --> 00:46:21.531
It's pretty impressive.

1304
00:46:21.531 --> 00:46:22.865
<v Regina>Pretty obvious, yeah.</v>

1305
00:46:22.865 --> 00:46:25.168
Okay, so I just wanted to address that,

1306
00:46:25.168 --> 00:46:27.535
you know, the year of the tiger, I like that.

1307
00:46:27.535 --> 00:46:29.972
But I wanted to address what is happening

1308
00:46:29.972 --> 00:46:31.574
in the East so that we can understand it

1309
00:46:31.574 --> 00:46:34.777
from a perhaps a little more fair point of view

1310
00:46:34.777 --> 00:46:36.979
than what the media is generally portraying

1311
00:46:36.979 --> 00:46:40.350
in creating that animosity and resentment and so forth.

1312
00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:42.118
No, you have some people handling things

1313
00:46:42.118 --> 00:46:43.352
in a smarter way than we are.

1314
00:46:43.352 --> 00:46:44.787
I mean, that's what it looks like to me.

1315
00:46:44.787 --> 00:46:47.189
So let's talk about smart.

1316
00:46:47.189 --> 00:46:50.193
What, at this stage of the game,

1317
00:46:50.193 --> 00:46:52.028
what could be done?

1318
00:46:52.028 --> 00:46:54.096
What can be done to create a different kind

1319
00:46:54.096 --> 00:46:56.765
of economic model in the West?

1320
00:46:56.765 --> 00:46:58.012
Is it too late?

1321
00:46:58.012 --> 00:47:00.102
I mean obviously we have to go through some

1322
00:47:00.102 --> 00:47:03.572
of the pain here, because we've created it.

1323
00:47:03.572 --> 00:47:05.440
But what's possible still?

1324
00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.711
<v ->Well, what's possible is everything.</v>

1325
00:47:07.711 --> 00:47:11.079
We've got all the resources, all the talent,

1326
00:47:11.079 --> 00:47:14.852
will power, we have everything we need.

1327
00:47:14.852 --> 00:47:16.885
We have a failing in our money system at this point in time.

1328
00:47:16.885 --> 00:47:18.587
I'll be honest with you, I don't think there are many ways

1329
00:47:18.587 --> 00:47:22.124
that we can resurrect or recover the U.S. dollar itself

1330
00:47:22.124 --> 00:47:23.658
as a unit of currency.

1331
00:47:23.658 --> 00:47:25.894
I think it's a little too far gone.

1332
00:47:25.894 --> 00:47:28.164
But there are lots of other monetary systems

1333
00:47:28.164 --> 00:47:29.699
that we could implement.

1334
00:47:29.699 --> 00:47:32.301
And, you know, if we were gonna talk about

1335
00:47:32.301 --> 00:47:35.270
how would we actually do that?

1336
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:37.172
I would suggest that what we do is we start

1337
00:47:37.172 --> 00:47:40.175
by standing up parallel currency systems.

1338
00:47:40.175 --> 00:47:41.677
And there's a lot of them out there.

1339
00:47:41.677 --> 00:47:43.445
There are mutual credit exchange systems,

1340
00:47:43.445 --> 00:47:45.847
there are time banks, there are demurrage.

1341
00:47:45.847 --> 00:47:47.249
I'm a real fan of demurrage.

1342
00:47:47.249 --> 00:47:48.350
<v Regina>I don't know about demurrage.</v>

1343
00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:49.451
<v ->Demurrage is,</v>

1344
00:47:49.451 --> 00:47:52.721
so there was a small town

1345
00:47:52.721 --> 00:47:56.026
in Europe that, right after the war I believe it was,

1346
00:47:56.026 --> 00:47:57.293
they were just ruined.

1347
00:47:57.293 --> 00:47:59.362
And they didn't have any money.

1348
00:47:59.362 --> 00:48:01.497
So the mayor of the town created a money system

1349
00:48:01.497 --> 00:48:03.098
where the town handed out money

1350
00:48:03.098 --> 00:48:06.201
but demurrage money has this really interesting feature.

1351
00:48:06.201 --> 00:48:07.102
You have to go,

1352
00:48:07.102 --> 00:48:09.306
it has little boxes on it in the system they used,

1353
00:48:09.306 --> 00:48:11.406
and you have to go get a stamp put in that box

1354
00:48:11.406 --> 00:48:12.843
or it becomes worthless.

1355
00:48:12.843 --> 00:48:14.645
Every time it gets a stamp on it,

1356
00:48:14.645 --> 00:48:16.046
it's worth a little bit less.

1357
00:48:16.046 --> 00:48:18.281
So it's money, the longer you hold on to it,

1358
00:48:18.281 --> 00:48:20.116
the less valuable it becomes.

1359
00:48:20.116 --> 00:48:22.051
So, people, when you get it,

1360
00:48:22.051 --> 00:48:24.653
you don't hoard it anymore.

1361
00:48:24.653 --> 00:48:26.188
It creates this incentive to like,

1362
00:48:26.188 --> 00:48:28.257
"Oh my gosh, I gotta go use this."

1363
00:48:28.257 --> 00:48:29.324
Right?

1364
00:48:29.324 --> 00:48:31.560
And so it's like reverse inflation, if you will.

1365
00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.494
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>

1366
00:48:32.494 --> 00:48:34.430
<v ->And it has all sorts of things that flow from that.</v>

1367
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:35.296
Here's the wonderful thing.

1368
00:48:35.296 --> 00:48:37.165
Money is an organizing concept.

1369
00:48:37.165 --> 00:48:38.102
That's all it is.

1370
00:48:38.102 --> 00:48:39.635
A paper dollar actually has nothing,

1371
00:48:39.635 --> 00:48:41.603
but it's a story, it has meaning between us

1372
00:48:41.603 --> 00:48:43.472
because we have assigned it some meaning.

1373
00:48:43.472 --> 00:48:45.741
And depending on which story you tell,

1374
00:48:45.741 --> 00:48:47.075
different outcomes happen.

1375
00:48:47.075 --> 00:48:48.377
You know, if it has a different plot line,

1376
00:48:48.377 --> 00:48:50.079
different enforces some things,

1377
00:48:50.079 --> 00:48:51.180
punishes others.

1378
00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:53.949
And demurrage money has a wonderful characteristic

1379
00:48:53.949 --> 00:48:57.354
of enforcing cooperation or creating incentives

1380
00:48:57.354 --> 00:48:59.809
for cooperation, of creating incentives

1381
00:48:59.809 --> 00:49:02.891
for keeping the money moving through a system,

1382
00:49:02.891 --> 00:49:04.927
and I think

1383
00:49:04.927 --> 00:49:08.064
if there's enough interesting elements to that story

1384
00:49:08.064 --> 00:49:09.798
that we should be trying it out.

1385
00:49:09.798 --> 00:49:10.965
Like I would, here's the thing.

1386
00:49:10.965 --> 00:49:12.764
I'm ultimately a scientist,

1387
00:49:12.764 --> 00:49:14.953
natural science was my background.

1388
00:49:14.953 --> 00:49:16.705
And I start to think of everything

1389
00:49:16.705 --> 00:49:19.208
kind of like, I think nature's kind of already got

1390
00:49:19.208 --> 00:49:20.878
the model for everything, right?

1391
00:49:20.878 --> 00:49:22.144
And since I can't find anything in nature

1392
00:49:22.144 --> 00:49:23.513
that grows exponentially forever,

1393
00:49:23.513 --> 00:49:25.648
I figure is probably a bad thing, a bad model.

1394
00:49:25.648 --> 00:49:26.915
There's no way to make it work

1395
00:49:26.915 --> 00:49:28.718
because nature hasn't figured out how to do it.

1396
00:49:28.718 --> 00:49:31.220
But one thing nature does is it's resilient

1397
00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:33.654
and it has lots and lots of competition.

1398
00:49:33.654 --> 00:49:35.123
Like for any bit of food out there,

1399
00:49:35.123 --> 00:49:36.526
tons of things are competing for it.

1400
00:49:36.526 --> 00:49:39.060
And it actually makes the system stronger not weaker.

1401
00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:41.565
We only have one money unit

1402
00:49:41.565 --> 00:49:44.500
that you can use in this country by law.

1403
00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:46.535
Well, what if we had two?

1404
00:49:46.535 --> 00:49:47.403
Wouldn't that be better?

1405
00:49:47.403 --> 00:49:48.338
Sort of like an ecosystem.

1406
00:49:48.338 --> 00:49:50.039
So this one, if this one's dry,

1407
00:49:50.039 --> 00:49:53.410
maybe this one's, you know, got rain falling on it,

1408
00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:55.877
and plus I would love what competition would bring

1409
00:49:55.877 --> 00:49:58.380
if the Federal Reserve now didn't just say,

1410
00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:00.817
"You all have to live with our decisions, ha, ha, ha."

1411
00:50:00.817 --> 00:50:04.320
But now had to entice me to use their product,

1412
00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:05.220
'cause that's all it is.

1413
00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:07.088
The Federal Reserve is just an organization

1414
00:50:07.088 --> 00:50:10.226
that has been licensed by law to have a cartel,

1415
00:50:10.226 --> 00:50:12.226
a monopoly over our money.

1416
00:50:12.226 --> 00:50:13.328
And so they have that.

1417
00:50:13.328 --> 00:50:14.397
And it's an enormous privilege.

1418
00:50:14.397 --> 00:50:16.665
But what if they had competition?

1419
00:50:16.665 --> 00:50:19.335
And so, again, you can ask a hundred people,

1420
00:50:19.335 --> 00:50:21.437
and no one would be able to give you an answer for this.

1421
00:50:21.437 --> 00:50:24.473
Why doesn't the treasury just print money

1422
00:50:24.473 --> 00:50:27.510
all by itself and hand it out?

1423
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:30.245
Why do we borrow money as a nation,

1424
00:50:30.245 --> 00:50:32.648
which is our national contract with each other,

1425
00:50:32.648 --> 00:50:35.216
why do we borrow that at interest from somebody?

1426
00:50:35.216 --> 00:50:37.370
<v Regina>And that question comes up a lot,</v>

1427
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:39.287
but the answer doesn't.

1428
00:50:39.287 --> 00:50:40.022
You're right.

1429
00:50:40.022 --> 00:50:40.956
The answer does not.

1430
00:50:40.956 --> 00:50:41.890
<v ->Hard to come by the answer.</v>

1431
00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:43.126
<v Regina>But doesn't the answer,</v>

1432
00:50:43.126 --> 00:50:44.860
is it that the answer really can't emerge

1433
00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:47.730
as long as you have these close bed fellow relationships

1434
00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:50.132
between the government and the Federal Reserve?

1435
00:50:50.132 --> 00:50:51.232
<v ->The problem is that</v>

1436
00:50:51.232 --> 00:50:53.268
that answer, if we did move

1437
00:50:53.268 --> 00:50:55.004
to the Treasury issuing its own money,

1438
00:50:55.004 --> 00:50:57.071
it would destroy a lot of the power base

1439
00:50:57.071 --> 00:51:00.342
of a lot of very powerful institutions and people.

1440
00:51:00.342 --> 00:51:01.945
So I understand there's an issue.

1441
00:51:01.945 --> 00:51:02.744
<v Regina>That's the answer.</v>

1442
00:51:02.744 --> 00:51:03.612
<v ->There's the problem.</v>

1443
00:51:03.612 --> 00:51:05.448
But there's no good economic reason why.

1444
00:51:05.448 --> 00:51:08.917
There's no fundamental or philosophical reason why.

1445
00:51:08.917 --> 00:51:11.320
There's potentially a power-based reason why,

1446
00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:13.522
but there's no other good answer for that.

1447
00:51:13.522 --> 00:51:14.623
So that would be my first step.

1448
00:51:14.623 --> 00:51:17.358
If I was in charge, like Obama says, "Do something,"

1449
00:51:17.358 --> 00:51:22.130
I would say, "Great, start issuing actual U.S. money.

1450
00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:23.865
"And put a lot of rules around it

1451
00:51:23.865 --> 00:51:25.601
"and make sure that we can't go down the same path

1452
00:51:25.601 --> 00:51:27.369
"of just printing scrillions of them.

1453
00:51:27.369 --> 00:51:29.071
"Make sure that it's tied to something,

1454
00:51:29.071 --> 00:51:30.405
"that when this money goes out,

1455
00:51:30.405 --> 00:51:33.575
"it's actually tied to economic output or development,

1456
00:51:33.575 --> 00:51:35.610
"or this money can only be used for certain things

1457
00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:38.781
"like infrastructure projects, or investing in R and D

1458
00:51:38.781 --> 00:51:40.548
"or something, just find some way of making

1459
00:51:40.548 --> 00:51:43.085
"that money go out and do things for our country."

1460
00:51:43.085 --> 00:51:44.886
And then all of a sudden, you know, people would have

1461
00:51:44.886 --> 00:51:46.789
the opportunity would you rather receive one of these

1462
00:51:46.789 --> 00:51:48.758
in payment or one of these?

1463
00:51:48.758 --> 00:51:51.129
And that's where the market gets to start to vote

1464
00:51:51.129 --> 00:51:52.562
and it creates competition.

1465
00:51:52.562 --> 00:51:55.130
It's important signals come back to the

1466
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:57.599
head organization about how they're operating

1467
00:51:57.599 --> 00:51:59.403
and what they're doing and whether the people

1468
00:51:59.403 --> 00:52:01.269
believe in it or not, all of that.

1469
00:52:01.269 --> 00:52:04.740
And then I would also allow multiple local currency systems

1470
00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:07.410
to stand up, because the national currency system

1471
00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:09.913
means that me living in Massachusetts

1472
00:52:09.913 --> 00:52:12.448
and you living in California, we are going to be subject

1473
00:52:12.448 --> 00:52:15.717
to the same whims and vagaries and conditions

1474
00:52:15.717 --> 00:52:18.387
that our currency is under regardless of whether

1475
00:52:18.387 --> 00:52:19.921
one region is experiencing

1476
00:52:19.921 --> 00:52:21.890
fundamentally different conditions from another.

1477
00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:23.593
So, local currencies can start to account

1478
00:52:23.593 --> 00:52:25.127
for the regional differences.

1479
00:52:25.127 --> 00:52:26.730
If this area has a lot more growth

1480
00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:28.438
and is a lot more exciting, maybe it should have

1481
00:52:28.438 --> 00:52:31.366
a different interest rate than we do over there.

1482
00:52:31.366 --> 00:52:32.534
And so on and so forth.

1483
00:52:32.534 --> 00:52:34.236
So, I would love to see an ecosystem

1484
00:52:34.236 --> 00:52:36.171
of currencies stand up.

1485
00:52:36.171 --> 00:52:37.706
And they can be all different ones

1486
00:52:37.706 --> 00:52:39.575
and not all of them are gonna be dollar based,

1487
00:52:39.575 --> 00:52:42.111
and many of them aren't gonna be interest based.

1488
00:52:42.111 --> 00:52:43.511
And some of them won't even have a concept

1489
00:52:43.511 --> 00:52:46.448
of debt associated with them at all.

1490
00:52:46.448 --> 00:52:48.216
And so this would be just very exciting.

1491
00:52:48.216 --> 00:52:49.786
And that's, we're gonna have to go there,

1492
00:52:49.786 --> 00:52:53.054
because our money system is enforcing exponential growth,

1493
00:52:53.054 --> 00:52:55.490
we know that we're not gonna be able to do that forever,

1494
00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:58.326
ergo, our money system breaks.

1495
00:52:58.326 --> 00:52:59.828
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1496
00:52:59.828 --> 00:53:02.430
<v ->So if we know that, let's get started,</v>

1497
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:03.698
let's get busy.

1498
00:53:03.698 --> 00:53:04.767
<v Regina>Okay, so what happens</v>

1499
00:53:04.767 --> 00:53:08.804
if we don't make preemptive measures,

1500
00:53:08.804 --> 00:53:11.006
take such preemptive measures

1501
00:53:11.006 --> 00:53:13.442
to start creating these systems

1502
00:53:13.442 --> 00:53:16.043
to replace the existing system?

1503
00:53:16.043 --> 00:53:18.814
<v ->If we don't do that, we just sustain the unsustainable,</v>

1504
00:53:18.814 --> 00:53:21.383
and preserve the status quo at any cost,

1505
00:53:21.383 --> 00:53:23.218
what's gonna happen is we're gonna overproduce

1506
00:53:23.218 --> 00:53:26.488
our currency, which we are doing by the bale

1507
00:53:26.488 --> 00:53:28.658
at this point in time, and that's gonna get us

1508
00:53:28.658 --> 00:53:32.293
into a position where the currency is ultimately gonna fail.

1509
00:53:32.293 --> 00:53:33.528
<v Regina>As we talked about</v>

1510
00:53:33.528 --> 00:53:34.830
in the very beginning of the interview,

1511
00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:37.899
it took 300 years to create the first trillion,

1512
00:53:37.899 --> 00:53:39.501
it's now down to four months,

1513
00:53:39.501 --> 00:53:41.838
we can get down to four weeks,

1514
00:53:41.838 --> 00:53:43.873
we can get down to four days.

1515
00:53:43.873 --> 00:53:46.742
<v ->I've told you that there is 3,800 paper currencies</v>

1516
00:53:46.742 --> 00:53:47.577
that have failed.

1517
00:53:47.577 --> 00:53:49.310
It could be 3,801.

1518
00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:51.412
There's no reason why our paper currency

1519
00:53:51.412 --> 00:53:53.114
is any different from any of the others

1520
00:53:53.114 --> 00:53:55.885
that have ever existed before and gone up in flames.

1521
00:53:55.885 --> 00:53:57.353
Yes, we're the world reserve currency,

1522
00:53:57.353 --> 00:53:58.520
yes, it's the United States,

1523
00:53:58.520 --> 00:53:59.422
yes, some things are different,

1524
00:53:59.422 --> 00:54:01.223
but let's be very clear about this.

1525
00:54:01.223 --> 00:54:04.459
Our dollar is not several hundred years old.

1526
00:54:04.459 --> 00:54:06.195
It's 39 years old.

1527
00:54:06.195 --> 00:54:08.731
August 15, 1971, with the abandonment

1528
00:54:08.731 --> 00:54:10.499
of the international gold standard,

1529
00:54:10.499 --> 00:54:13.101
we went to an all new type of a currency.

1530
00:54:13.101 --> 00:54:14.935
We went to a floating exchange rate,

1531
00:54:14.935 --> 00:54:16.906
debt-based fiat money system.

1532
00:54:16.906 --> 00:54:19.209
It's a mouthful, but that's what happened.

1533
00:54:19.209 --> 00:54:21.509
So we're only about call it almost 40 years

1534
00:54:21.509 --> 00:54:22.811
into this particular experiment.

1535
00:54:22.811 --> 00:54:25.113
Now, that's about how long paper currencies

1536
00:54:25.113 --> 00:54:26.916
have lasted historically.

1537
00:54:26.916 --> 00:54:28.416
Because they all get into the same trouble

1538
00:54:28.416 --> 00:54:31.119
for the same reasons, and it's just a human story.

1539
00:54:31.119 --> 00:54:32.989
It's not a finance story.

1540
00:54:32.989 --> 00:54:34.756
Finance makes it sound like it's scientific

1541
00:54:34.756 --> 00:54:36.591
or math-based or something, and it's not.

1542
00:54:36.591 --> 00:54:38.459
It's just a human story.

1543
00:54:38.459 --> 00:54:40.329
And if you understand how it was

1544
00:54:40.329 --> 00:54:42.698
that the denarius in Roman times got debased

1545
00:54:42.698 --> 00:54:46.469
from 95% purity to 0.02%.

1546
00:54:46.469 --> 00:54:48.004
Imagine that in Roman times, they figured out

1547
00:54:48.004 --> 00:54:50.838
how to electroplate silver onto lead slugs.

1548
00:54:50.838 --> 00:54:52.574
That's awesome, they didn't even have electricity,

1549
00:54:52.574 --> 00:54:54.076
and they figured out how to do that.

1550
00:54:54.076 --> 00:54:55.476
High marks, right?

1551
00:54:55.476 --> 00:54:56.811
<v Regina>Wow, and necessity is</v>

1552
00:54:56.811 --> 00:54:58.747
the mother of invention, they say.

1553
00:54:58.747 --> 00:54:59.850
<v ->It was fabulous.</v>

1554
00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:01.216
<v Regina>Well, greed is, anyway.</v>

1555
00:55:01.216 --> 00:55:03.985
<v ->Yeah, so, listen, our currency is not that old,</v>

1556
00:55:03.985 --> 00:55:05.721
so this is, you know, it would be a mistake

1557
00:55:05.721 --> 00:55:08.557
to think, well we have very intelligent people,

1558
00:55:08.557 --> 00:55:11.093
it's a sophisticated system, it's I can't understand it,

1559
00:55:11.093 --> 00:55:13.862
so I'll just trust that they're gonna be running it well.

1560
00:55:13.862 --> 00:55:15.765
And the truth of the matter is, I don't think

1561
00:55:15.765 --> 00:55:18.934
they really understand what they're doing.

1562
00:55:18.934 --> 00:55:20.469
Ben Bernake has displayed,

1563
00:55:20.469 --> 00:55:22.371
he was our current Federal Reserve Chairman,

1564
00:55:22.371 --> 00:55:24.607
and we'll see how long that lasts.

1565
00:55:24.607 --> 00:55:26.942
He has displayed absolutely no understanding

1566
00:55:26.942 --> 00:55:29.611
of the basic, fundamental issues

1567
00:55:29.611 --> 00:55:30.912
that have been going on.

1568
00:55:30.912 --> 00:55:33.216
2007, he said we didn't have a housing bubble.

1569
00:55:33.216 --> 00:55:34.449
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1570
00:55:34.449 --> 00:55:36.551
<v ->He didn't see the crisis coming.</v>

1571
00:55:36.551 --> 00:55:39.887
He's fundamentally out of tune with what's going on.

1572
00:55:39.887 --> 00:55:43.092
So, I just think everybody's got

1573
00:55:43.092 --> 00:55:45.426
to look at these issues for themselves,

1574
00:55:45.426 --> 00:55:47.095
start to trust themselves,

1575
00:55:47.095 --> 00:55:50.032
educate themselves, 'cause this is no longer,

1576
00:55:50.032 --> 00:55:53.601
we've abdicated the responsibility out and trusted,

1577
00:55:53.601 --> 00:55:57.071
it's time to reel it back in, take the responsibility back,

1578
00:55:57.071 --> 00:55:58.740
understand what's going on,

1579
00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:02.944
and be aware that there's a very, very high possibility

1580
00:56:02.944 --> 00:56:06.648
that our current monetary system will expire,

1581
00:56:06.648 --> 00:56:09.418
an untimely death, it'll be a timely one,

1582
00:56:09.418 --> 00:56:11.454
some time in the next five, 10, 20 years.

1583
00:56:11.454 --> 00:56:13.738
It's a chance, it's a very high chance.

1584
00:56:14.856 --> 00:56:16.425
<v Regina>So education is really key</v>

1585
00:56:16.425 --> 00:56:20.529
and you've provided a wonderful venue for that.

1586
00:56:20.529 --> 00:56:23.064
And people can log on and they can take

1587
00:56:23.064 --> 00:56:25.134
this crash course, they can do the crash course free,

1588
00:56:25.134 --> 00:56:26.101
right, I mean, it's just,

1589
00:56:26.101 --> 00:56:28.136
but you have a newsletter, you have blogs

1590
00:56:28.136 --> 00:56:30.306
that you write as well, so people can also help

1591
00:56:30.306 --> 00:56:34.643
support the work you do, and also be privy to some

1592
00:56:34.643 --> 00:56:37.346
pretty cool information on the inside, too.

1593
00:56:37.346 --> 00:56:39.013
Because your, I'd just say,

1594
00:56:39.013 --> 00:56:40.682
you're filling that basket of nuts all the time

1595
00:56:40.682 --> 00:56:42.217
with new kernels of information.

1596
00:56:42.217 --> 00:56:44.987
<v ->I'm scouting all the time, and there's just so much</v>

1597
00:56:44.987 --> 00:56:46.908
going on, it's almost,

1598
00:56:46.908 --> 00:56:48.590
two years ago, I could keep up with everything,

1599
00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:50.926
now I can't keep up with everything anymore,

1600
00:56:50.926 --> 00:56:52.827
it's amazing how much is going on right now.

1601
00:56:52.827 --> 00:56:53.795
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1602
00:56:53.795 --> 00:56:55.431
Well, on that note, we'll encourage everybody

1603
00:56:55.431 --> 00:56:57.633
to go to your site, and do the crash course,

1604
00:56:57.633 --> 00:57:00.102
and find out essentially the backdrop

1605
00:57:00.102 --> 00:57:01.503
to this whole story, so we can make

1606
00:57:01.503 --> 00:57:03.739
more intelligent decisions and take the power back,

1607
00:57:03.739 --> 00:57:05.240
as you'd say.

1608
00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:09.277
And let's hope we get creative sooner than later.

1609
00:57:09.277 --> 00:57:10.880
<v ->Let's hope.</v>

1610
00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:11.913
<v Regina>Thank you, Chris.</v>

1611
00:57:11.913 --> 00:57:13.365
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1612
00:57:15.517 --> 00:57:17.652
<v ->You can go to chrismartenson.com,</v>

1613
00:57:17.652 --> 00:57:18.988
and that's Martenson with an O,

1614
00:57:18.988 --> 00:57:21.057
M-A-R-T-E-N-S-O-N,

1615
00:57:21.057 --> 00:57:22.391
to take the crash course,

1616
00:57:22.391 --> 00:57:23.893
or to become a member of the site

1617
00:57:23.893 --> 00:57:25.160
for regular updates.

1618
00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:26.428
I highly recommend it.

1619
00:57:26.428 --> 00:57:28.062
