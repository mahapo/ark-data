00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.493
<v ->Dr. Robert Scaer knows trauma.</v>

2
00:00:03.493 --> 00:00:06.433
As a child he experienced many life-altering events,

3
00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:08.933
not the least of which was losing his left eye

4
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:11.353
after it was pierced with a coat hanger.

5
00:00:11.353 --> 00:00:13.133
He ultimately became a neurologist,

6
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.553
dedicating his life to the alleviation

7
00:00:14.553 --> 00:00:16.903
of pain and suffering.

8
00:00:16.903 --> 00:00:20.203
Dr. Scaer's new book," The Trauma Spectrum:

9
00:00:20.203 --> 00:00:22.343
"Hidden Wounds and Human Resiliency",

10
00:00:22.343 --> 00:00:24.923
states that it's not necessarily big dramas

11
00:00:24.923 --> 00:00:26.883
that shape our life experience,

12
00:00:26.883 --> 00:00:29.863
rather, little everyday traumas that impact

13
00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:33.043
all facets of our daily lives and inner experience.

14
00:00:33.043 --> 00:00:35.603
He says these everyday negative experiences

15
00:00:35.603 --> 00:00:38.363
mold our personalities, choices of partners,

16
00:00:38.363 --> 00:00:42.193
appetites, and much more.

17
00:00:46.763 --> 00:00:49.243
<v Voiceover>What would you say in terms of percentages</v>

18
00:00:49.243 --> 00:00:51.143
of the population at large have been

19
00:00:51.143 --> 00:00:54.003
traumatized to one degree or another?

20
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:55.503
<v ->100%.</v>

21
00:00:55.503 --> 00:00:56.883
<v Voiceover>100%.</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

22
00:00:56.883 --> 00:00:58.443
<v Voiceover>Okay, so we'll start from that.</v>

23
00:00:58.443 --> 00:01:01.143
And we'll start with a relatively healthy person,

24
00:01:01.143 --> 00:01:04.243
who isn't day in, day out, experiencing tremors

25
00:01:04.243 --> 00:01:06.263
or traumas or nightmares or anything,

26
00:01:06.263 --> 00:01:08.183
what are some of the normal, run-of-the-mill

27
00:01:08.183 --> 00:01:11.823
types of traumas we experience from birth on?

28
00:01:11.823 --> 00:01:13.623
Let's start with birth.

29
00:01:13.623 --> 00:01:16.683
<v ->We can start with birth, we can start</v>

30
00:01:16.683 --> 00:01:17.863
with birth or we can start from the

31
00:01:17.863 --> 00:01:22.123
standard definitional context of trauma,

32
00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:24.683
which misses the boat a lot of times.
<v Voiceover>Let's start with the</v>

33
00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:26.983
standard definition and tell us why it misses the boat.

34
00:01:26.983 --> 00:01:28.383
<v ->The standard definition, of course, evolves</v>

35
00:01:28.383 --> 00:01:32.563
with different editions, it was called the DSM 4,

36
00:01:32.563 --> 00:01:36.283
Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of mental disorders.

37
00:01:36.283 --> 00:01:39.683
But the latest, which is now almost twenty years old,

38
00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:43.063
or is twenty years old, is PTSD, post traumatic

39
00:01:43.063 --> 00:01:45.563
stress disorder, which has specific criteria

40
00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:48.523
for the types of things that would be inclusive

41
00:01:48.523 --> 00:01:51.803
of what a traumatic event is, and it's

42
00:01:51.803 --> 00:01:55.643
quite specific, and then what the symptoms

43
00:01:55.643 --> 00:01:59.743
are allowed to be that would make this definition be good.

44
00:01:59.743 --> 00:02:01.003
<v Voiceover>So, I'm guessing from what you're saying,</v>

45
00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:03.203
it's a rather narrow band of definitions.

46
00:02:03.203 --> 00:02:04.883
<v ->It's a narrow band of definition,</v>

47
00:02:04.883 --> 00:02:07.943
which one has to do in order to do research in the field.

48
00:02:07.943 --> 00:02:10.923
You have to take the bell curve continuum

49
00:02:10.923 --> 00:02:13.743
of life experiences, take a portion of it,

50
00:02:13.743 --> 00:02:15.743
and define that as your entity,

51
00:02:15.743 --> 00:02:17.963
otherwise you can't do research on it.

52
00:02:17.963 --> 00:02:22.703
So, I look at the DSM 4 as an artifact of research.

53
00:02:22.703 --> 00:02:25.343
<v Voiceover>(laughs) Interesting choice of words.</v>

54
00:02:25.343 --> 00:02:28.143
You were bound to it yourself, being

55
00:02:28.143 --> 00:02:30.803
a practicing M.D.; now, how did you

56
00:02:30.803 --> 00:02:34.603
move beyond that standard understanding?

57
00:02:34.603 --> 00:02:36.263
<v ->Well, I was not biased by my training</v>

58
00:02:36.263 --> 00:02:39.043
to depend upon the DSM 4, because I'm

59
00:02:39.043 --> 00:02:40.963
a neurologist, and I came upon the field

60
00:02:40.963 --> 00:02:44.405
of behavioral medicine by serendipitous default

61
00:02:44.405 --> 00:02:47.225
through the work I did in rehabilitation,

62
00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:51.445
which is more of a holistic neurological practice.

63
00:02:51.445 --> 00:02:56.445
And so, I wasn't biased by PTSD, I was at the start,

64
00:02:56.665 --> 00:02:59.465
but as I began to look at the spectrum of symptoms

65
00:02:59.465 --> 00:03:01.205
in patients I knew to be traumatized,

66
00:03:01.205 --> 00:03:04.725
I realized that there was many, many other

67
00:03:04.725 --> 00:03:06.205
expressions of trauma other than

68
00:03:06.205 --> 00:03:08.685
what's described in the book, and

69
00:03:08.685 --> 00:03:12.525
I began to explore that, especially since I

70
00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:14.005
was dealing with what we would call

71
00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:17.565
somatic expressions or manifestations of trauma.

72
00:03:17.565 --> 00:03:18.745
<v Voiceover>And what does that mean?</v>

73
00:03:18.745 --> 00:03:20.865
<v ->The symptoms in the body that</v>

74
00:03:20.865 --> 00:03:23.665
trauma victims experience which are called

75
00:03:23.665 --> 00:03:27.245
somatization disorder, which is another

76
00:03:27.245 --> 00:03:29.665
entirely different spectrum of

77
00:03:29.665 --> 00:03:31.105
description in the DSM 4, that

78
00:03:31.105 --> 00:03:33.185
has nothing to do with trauma.

79
00:03:33.185 --> 00:03:35.865
But in fact, somatization, and prominent

80
00:03:35.865 --> 00:03:37.605
specialists realized this now,

81
00:03:37.605 --> 00:03:39.305
somatization is a huge portion of

82
00:03:39.305 --> 00:03:42.305
the physical experience and expression of trauma,

83
00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:46.605
in the later stages of trauma that go beyond PTSD.

84
00:03:46.605 --> 00:03:49.405
And this is recognized now as what's called

85
00:03:49.405 --> 00:03:52.525
complex trauma, and there's a diagonistic

86
00:03:52.525 --> 00:03:55.725
category called DESNOS, D-E-S-N-O-S, or

87
00:03:55.725 --> 00:04:00.422
Disorders of Extreme Stress Not Otherwise Specified.

88
00:04:00.422 --> 00:04:02.322
<v Voiceover>Okay, and a lot the work falls into this area.</v>

89
00:04:02.322 --> 00:04:05.142
<v ->And much of what really is trauma</v>

90
00:04:05.142 --> 00:04:08.422
falls into that category, and as a result,

91
00:04:08.422 --> 00:04:12.042
we're looking at, I term it as, PTSD

92
00:04:12.042 --> 00:04:14.502
is the tip of the trauma iceberg,

93
00:04:14.502 --> 00:04:17.002
and DESNOS, or complex trauma is the

94
00:04:17.002 --> 00:04:19.582
vast body of experiences that we

95
00:04:19.582 --> 00:04:22.462
all experience related to the cumulative

96
00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:26.022
negative life experiences that we've had.

97
00:04:26.022 --> 00:04:27.142
<v Voiceover>And most of us, I think,</v>

98
00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:28.842
have come to accept, "Oh, life is

99
00:04:28.842 --> 00:04:31.582
"challenging, it's stressful, yeah, you have your traumas,"

100
00:04:31.582 --> 00:04:33.402
and we think there's not much we can do about it.

101
00:04:33.402 --> 00:04:36.102
Obviously, as we'll discover in this conversation

102
00:04:36.102 --> 00:04:38.072
a lot has changed in that way.

103
00:04:38.072 --> 00:04:40.972
There are modalities of feeling that can be used.

104
00:04:40.972 --> 00:04:43.772
But let's start with birth, let's start with our own births,

105
00:04:43.772 --> 00:04:45.432
I mean, if you've ever witnessed one,

106
00:04:45.432 --> 00:04:47.652
certainly it would seem to be a traumatic event,

107
00:04:47.652 --> 00:04:50.072
and we've all certainly experienced birth.

108
00:04:50.072 --> 00:04:53.272
<v ->Right, but it need not be a traumatic event.</v>

109
00:04:53.272 --> 00:04:55.932
I've witnessed birth, I've performed birth,

110
00:04:55.932 --> 00:04:58.772
including on one of my daughters,

111
00:04:58.772 --> 00:05:01.052
and it may be a traumatic event,

112
00:05:01.052 --> 00:05:04.232
depending upon how it's approached

113
00:05:04.232 --> 00:05:08.352
by the person giving birth and by those

114
00:05:08.352 --> 00:05:11.172
who are assisting the birth, and birth,

115
00:05:11.172 --> 00:05:13.412
in fact, is a very natural event, obviously;

116
00:05:13.412 --> 00:05:15.832
it's a event of significant risk,

117
00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:19.472
and a lot of life experiences carry a significant risk.

118
00:05:19.472 --> 00:05:21.392
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about the classic</v>

119
00:05:21.392 --> 00:05:23.552
Western birth, in the hospital,

120
00:05:23.552 --> 00:05:27.252
and the traumas associated with that,

121
00:05:27.252 --> 00:05:28.612
and then let's look at it through

122
00:05:28.612 --> 00:05:30.332
the other lens in the most natural

123
00:05:30.332 --> 00:05:33.032
possible environment and experience.

124
00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:34.339
<v ->Let's do it the reverse; let's</v>

125
00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:37.177
look at the natural and then at the hospital experience,

126
00:05:37.177 --> 00:05:41.297
'cause that will then exemplify.

127
00:05:41.297 --> 00:05:44.617
In a natural birth, the birth has its own progression,

128
00:05:44.617 --> 00:05:48.157
which takes place naturally, and is usually

129
00:05:48.157 --> 00:05:52.377
attended in an optimal setting

130
00:05:52.377 --> 00:05:55.957
by a lot of social support, there will be

131
00:05:55.957 --> 00:05:58.997
other women who assist the birthing mother

132
00:05:58.997 --> 00:06:01.677
in the process, and most, more simpler

133
00:06:01.677 --> 00:06:05.817
societies do this, there are women assistants to the birth,

134
00:06:05.817 --> 00:06:09.537
and often times it's a midwife or woman

135
00:06:09.537 --> 00:06:14.517
assists the birth and births the child.

136
00:06:14.517 --> 00:06:18.537
And in this process, there are rituals that take place,

137
00:06:18.537 --> 00:06:20.277
that assist the mother, there are certain

138
00:06:20.277 --> 00:06:22.677
positions that mother assumes that

139
00:06:22.677 --> 00:06:26.877
are physiologically logical, and in

140
00:06:26.877 --> 00:06:30.437
most societies the woman gives birth squatting.

141
00:06:30.437 --> 00:06:34.597
Because gravity helps, gravity helps.

142
00:06:34.597 --> 00:06:38.397
And this facilitates the birth process,

143
00:06:38.397 --> 00:06:41.217
and after the birth, the infant is put

144
00:06:41.217 --> 00:06:44.377
on the skin, the belly of the mother,

145
00:06:44.377 --> 00:06:45.957
and the infant, and if you've seen

146
00:06:45.957 --> 00:06:47.757
videos of this, will crawl up and

147
00:06:47.757 --> 00:06:51.237
attach itself to a breast, and this

148
00:06:51.237 --> 00:06:54.177
the sort of the usual process of a healthy birth

149
00:06:54.177 --> 00:06:59.177
in a setting that has been in effect for eons.

150
00:07:01.037 --> 00:07:04.397
And this process contains elements

151
00:07:04.397 --> 00:07:08.237
of attachment that are critical to brain development,

152
00:07:08.237 --> 00:07:12.537
including tactiles, touch, stimuli, early nursing.

153
00:07:12.537 --> 00:07:17.057
Early nursing releases oxytocin which causes

154
00:07:17.057 --> 00:07:19.817
the uterus to contract and prevents bleeding.

155
00:07:19.817 --> 00:07:23.977
It also produces a rush of affiliative behavior,

156
00:07:23.977 --> 00:07:25.517
both in the infant and the mother.

157
00:07:25.517 --> 00:07:28.437
<v Voiceover>When you say affiliative, being?</v>
<v ->Affiliative bonding behavior.</v>

158
00:07:28.437 --> 00:07:32.817
There is a mutual conditioned attraction

159
00:07:32.817 --> 00:07:35.777
with this initial release of oxytocin

160
00:07:35.777 --> 00:07:37.757
and actually endorphins, the brain's

161
00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:40.657
pain modulating chemicals, produces

162
00:07:40.657 --> 00:07:43.297
an affiliative response and bonding.

163
00:07:43.297 --> 00:07:45.317
And the skin-to-skin contact is profoundly

164
00:07:45.317 --> 00:07:48.877
important in contributing to that release of oxytocin.

165
00:07:48.877 --> 00:07:52.397
So this process, in its optimal state,

166
00:07:52.397 --> 00:07:55.157
creates, then, this environment between

167
00:07:55.157 --> 00:07:57.757
the mother and child, which is perpetuated

168
00:07:57.757 --> 00:08:01.097
through infancy, in what we call maternal

169
00:08:01.097 --> 00:08:04.297
infant bonding, or attunement, or affiliation,

170
00:08:04.297 --> 00:08:08.457
which has incredibly important neurophysiological

171
00:08:08.457 --> 00:08:12.397
developmental implications, because this bond

172
00:08:12.397 --> 00:08:14.737
stimulates the development of a

173
00:08:14.737 --> 00:08:17.617
part of the brain that regulates the

174
00:08:17.617 --> 00:08:21.277
emotional brain, and the autonomic brain.

175
00:08:21.277 --> 00:08:26.277
And results in a very resilient infant, child, and adult.

176
00:08:27.777 --> 00:08:29.697
They're well-modulated; they have the

177
00:08:29.697 --> 00:08:32.497
systems intact which control excessive

178
00:08:32.497 --> 00:08:36.757
swings of both emotional and autonomic excess.

179
00:08:36.757 --> 00:08:40.537
And it creates autonomic regulation

180
00:08:40.537 --> 00:08:43.677
and emotional regulation throughout the life span.

181
00:08:43.677 --> 00:08:45.617
So this is the optimal birth, that

182
00:08:45.617 --> 00:08:48.710
contains these elements of affiliation.

183
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:49.750
<v Voiceover>Let's go to a classic</v>

184
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.290
Western birth in the hospital.

185
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:54.310
<v ->In a hospital birth, and this is evolved</v>

186
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.651
over centuries, actually, but only

187
00:08:57.651 --> 00:09:02.651
in the last 150 years has birth entered the hospital.

188
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.210
And of course, the initial exposure was

189
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.091
to an environment that was full of terrible germs

190
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:11.930
because the obstetricians or the physicians

191
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.930
would go from the autopsy lab to

192
00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:16.490
the birthing lab with bare hands,

193
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.470
and the syndrome of what's called

194
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.610
puerperal fever, or birth fever,

195
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:26.490
evolved with about a 60% fatality rate in mothers.

196
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.650
So, clearly, the introduction of an in-hospital

197
00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:33.470
birth created a risky environment,

198
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.790
which gradually was litigated against

199
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.570
by advances in infectious diseases

200
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.790
and the like, but even so, at the

201
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.790
turn of the 20th century, and the

202
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.430
discovery of anesthesia was applied to birth,

203
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.410
and mothers were giving birth with ether

204
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:52.210
anesthesia, which broke the whole bond.

205
00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:53.530
<v Voiceover>I was going to say, I mean,</v>

206
00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:54.990
essentially, they were unconscious.

207
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:56.810
<v ->They were unconscious, and that</v>

208
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.950
required the use of instruments, then,

209
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.690
because that interrupted labor, so

210
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.190
the developed instruments to extract

211
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:08.290
the infant, forceps, so every introduction

212
00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.210
of an intervention which was supposedly

213
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.530
for the benefit of the mother and child

214
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:16.030
resulted in other technological interventions

215
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.310
to compensate for the changing in the

216
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.830
automatic progress of the birth process, and that's

217
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:26.830
been the history of obstetrics; I'm speaking heresy here.

218
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.670
<v Voiceover>Well, I know you may be,</v>

219
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:30.990
considering the fact that you have

220
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.730
governing boards that have governed

221
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.130
your practice throughout your life,

222
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.750
however, looking at the statistics

223
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.850
as time has gone on, especially,

224
00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:40.890
I don't know if you have them,

225
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.670
but in the earlier years when births

226
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.870
started being introduced through the hospitals,

227
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.350
what kind of statistics did you see

228
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.290
in infant mortality side by side

229
00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.730
with natural births versus hospital births?

230
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:54.330
<v ->It's hard to get that because</v>

231
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.950
research in natural birth versus hospital births

232
00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:02.950
has been sketchy, and in a country that's

233
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.730
still intervenes with almost all births,

234
00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.230
it's very hard to get measurements,

235
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.210
because even a natural birth in a hospital,

236
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.610
is interfered with, generally.

237
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.800
And outcomes and infants have to

238
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.380
do with mortality and morbidity,

239
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.980
meaning physical diseases and damage

240
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.440
and the like, when in fact, perhaps

241
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.800
one of the most important outcomes

242
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.980
is in this process of attunement and

243
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.120
attachment between a mother and infant.

244
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.860
We know that separation of the infant from

245
00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.960
the mother, for instance, results in

246
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.760
dramatic changes in the brain.

247
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.080
And in animals, for instance, these changes are for life.

248
00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.460
Taking a rat pup away from the mother, the dam,

249
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.720
for one hour will create a lifetime of

250
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.700
autonomic disregulation in the rat pup.

251
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:50.660
<v Voiceover>So what happens when</v>

252
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.420
you take the babies away from the mother

253
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.960
in the maternity ward and, as was popular in the 50's,

254
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.580
and think, what, even into the 60's,

255
00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.960
breastfeeding was out of vogue for a while,

256
00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.260
you don't even bond through breastfeeding

257
00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.060
with the mother; what happened to those people?

258
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.620
<v ->The same thing happens, now, the time</v>

259
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.760
is proportionate to life span of the individual,

260
00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.000
so, one hour with an infant from her mother

261
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.172
is less likely than with a rat,

262
00:12:15.172 --> 00:12:17.272
but nevertheless, removal of the

263
00:12:17.272 --> 00:12:18.672
infant from the mother immediately

264
00:12:18.672 --> 00:12:21.012
after birth to perform the usual rituals

265
00:12:21.012 --> 00:12:23.592
of sticking the heel for blood,

266
00:12:23.592 --> 00:12:25.352
and putting drops in the eyes, and

267
00:12:25.352 --> 00:12:28.813
suctioning the infant, which has no rationale whatsoever,

268
00:12:28.813 --> 00:12:31.032
does result in separation and actually

269
00:12:31.032 --> 00:12:34.532
traumatizes the infant in the process.

270
00:12:34.532 --> 00:12:35.352
<v Voiceover>So what do you see</v>

271
00:12:35.352 --> 00:12:39.952
as life goes on, what are some of the symptoms

272
00:12:39.952 --> 00:12:43.252
of that kind of trauma as their lives develop then?

273
00:12:43.252 --> 00:12:45.992
<v ->The trauma is, basically, in its purest form,</v>

274
00:12:45.992 --> 00:12:48.832
disregulation, meaning, an interruption

275
00:12:48.832 --> 00:12:52.472
in the normal smooth regulatory patterns

276
00:12:52.472 --> 00:12:57.032
of autonomic cycling, which we call homeostasis,

277
00:12:57.032 --> 00:13:00.512
optimal state, of regulatory function

278
00:13:00.512 --> 00:13:02.933
within the brain and body, and that's

279
00:13:02.933 --> 00:13:06.492
what's disrupted, because the part of

280
00:13:06.492 --> 00:13:08.732
the brain that develops and grows

281
00:13:08.732 --> 00:13:13.172
with attunement, regulates that autonomic cycle.

282
00:13:13.172 --> 00:13:15.912
And that brain does not develop

283
00:13:15.912 --> 00:13:17.892
as well if one doesn't have the

284
00:13:17.892 --> 00:13:21.492
early experiences of attunement and bonding.

285
00:13:21.492 --> 00:13:23.332
And of course, anesthesia birth,

286
00:13:23.332 --> 00:13:26.232
a cesarean section drastically disrupts that.
<v Voiceover>I was just going to ask that,</v>

287
00:13:26.232 --> 00:13:28.872
and people are doing this now voluntarily

288
00:13:28.872 --> 00:13:30.612
so they can have their baby on a Tuesday

289
00:13:30.612 --> 00:13:33.392
or the doctor doesn't have to be

290
00:13:33.392 --> 00:13:34.752
inconvenienced on the weekend,

291
00:13:34.752 --> 00:13:39.752
or choose an astrological sign, all the above.
<v ->All those factors, all the above.</v>

292
00:13:40.352 --> 00:13:42.472
Other considerations too.
<v Voiceover>That's right, other considerations,</v>

293
00:13:42.472 --> 00:13:44.892
so they have something like 30% plus

294
00:13:44.892 --> 00:13:47.952
are now having cesarean births in this country,

295
00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:50.012
something has to be intrinsically wrong with that,

296
00:13:50.012 --> 00:13:52.553
and it has its own traumas; can you

297
00:13:52.553 --> 00:13:54.772
talk about the traumas of cesarean birth?

298
00:13:54.772 --> 00:13:56.472
<v ->Well, cesarean birth traumatizes</v>

299
00:13:56.472 --> 00:14:00.313
the mother in that there's invasion in the process,

300
00:14:00.313 --> 00:14:02.572
and that there's pain induced,

301
00:14:02.572 --> 00:14:05.272
which is considerable, requiring

302
00:14:05.272 --> 00:14:09.212
narcotic medication for the mother,

303
00:14:09.212 --> 00:14:10.952
which interferes with her capacity

304
00:14:10.952 --> 00:14:12.872
to attune and bond to the baby.

305
00:14:12.872 --> 00:14:15.952
And as a result, the mother is

306
00:14:15.952 --> 00:14:18.412
inhibited in this process, the instance

307
00:14:18.412 --> 00:14:19.912
of breastfeeding will drastically

308
00:14:19.912 --> 00:14:22.272
go down because the hormonal influences

309
00:14:22.272 --> 00:14:25.012
that stimulate production of milk

310
00:14:25.012 --> 00:14:27.232
are interrupted by this process.

311
00:14:27.232 --> 00:14:30.612
And so, the instance of breastfeeding diminishes greatly.

312
00:14:30.612 --> 00:14:33.092
And the fact that the infant has

313
00:14:33.092 --> 00:14:36.412
to be separated from the mother for a period of time,

314
00:14:36.412 --> 00:14:41.412
the mother's in pain, and holding the infant is painful.

315
00:14:41.572 --> 00:14:43.772
<v Voiceover>So, you have the</v>

316
00:14:43.772 --> 00:14:45.932
disassociative stuff that goes with

317
00:14:45.932 --> 00:14:47.752
not being able to bond immediately,

318
00:14:47.752 --> 00:14:48.912
that's obvious, anything else with

319
00:14:48.912 --> 00:14:51.672
cesarean births in terms of trauma to the infant?

320
00:14:51.672 --> 00:14:56.672
<v ->This is something that's not really been studied,</v>

321
00:14:57.112 --> 00:15:00.972
is the passage through the birth canal traumatic?

322
00:15:00.972 --> 00:15:03.352
Or is it facilitory?

323
00:15:03.352 --> 00:15:04.232
<v Voiceover>Yeah, my understanding</v>

324
00:15:04.232 --> 00:15:05.512
is that it helps the brain start kicking in

325
00:15:05.512 --> 00:15:08.552
to producing certain amino acids and so forth.

326
00:15:08.552 --> 00:15:13.212
<v ->And I think by definition it's facilitory.</v>

327
00:15:13.212 --> 00:15:15.892
In other words, I think that passage is important.

328
00:15:15.892 --> 00:15:18.192
Is it risky?

329
00:15:18.192 --> 00:15:19.812
Well, it may be risky at times,

330
00:15:19.812 --> 00:15:22.292
depending upon the presentation of the infant,

331
00:15:22.292 --> 00:15:25.512
but basically, doctors, obstetricians,

332
00:15:25.512 --> 00:15:28.412
they're no longer trained to do breech births, for instance.

333
00:15:28.412 --> 00:15:32.312
So it's automatically an abnormal

334
00:15:32.312 --> 00:15:34.832
presentation as a trigger for a C-section,

335
00:15:34.832 --> 00:15:35.952
because the skills to perform those

336
00:15:35.952 --> 00:15:39.792
are thought to be archaic and aren't really taught.

337
00:15:39.792 --> 00:15:40.592
<v Voiceover>Well, it's highly</v>

338
00:15:40.592 --> 00:15:42.232
profitable to have a C-section.

339
00:15:42.232 --> 00:15:44.772
<v ->And also it mitigates medical legal liability</v>

340
00:15:44.772 --> 00:15:46.852
if one does a C-section; what we've

341
00:15:46.852 --> 00:15:48.112
found, of course, is that infant

342
00:15:48.112 --> 00:15:51.132
mortality is not helped by C-sections.

343
00:15:51.132 --> 00:15:52.732
<v Voiceover>Interesting, what do you know about that?</v>

344
00:15:52.732 --> 00:15:54.572
<v ->Infant mortality in the United States</v>

345
00:15:54.572 --> 00:15:57.412
is much less than many countries

346
00:15:57.412 --> 00:16:01.072
that do not have invasive birthing procedures.

347
00:16:01.072 --> 00:16:03.652
So, we have not improved on it despite,

348
00:16:03.652 --> 00:16:06.692
electronic fetal monitoring, and

349
00:16:06.692 --> 00:16:08.052
all the techniques that are used,

350
00:16:08.052 --> 00:16:10.252
vacuum extraction, and things of that sort, all of which

351
00:16:10.252 --> 00:16:13.492
are invasive, they haven't improved infant mortality.

352
00:16:13.492 --> 00:16:14.432
<v Voiceover>They have not improved</v>

353
00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:17.332
in the U.S., very interesting.
<v ->But that's, you know, that's sort of</v>

354
00:16:17.332 --> 00:16:19.232
not important to what we're talking about,

355
00:16:19.232 --> 00:16:20.672
what we're talking about is the interruption

356
00:16:20.672 --> 00:16:24.372
of this affiliated bond, which is critical.

357
00:16:24.372 --> 00:16:29.372
And as far as many neuroscientists are concerned,

358
00:16:30.112 --> 00:16:33.072
that is the critical event in one's life

359
00:16:33.072 --> 00:16:35.692
that determines the subsequent vulnerability

360
00:16:35.692 --> 00:16:38.352
to life trauma through the life span.

361
00:16:38.352 --> 00:16:40.792
In other words, that creates more

362
00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:43.632
resiliency than any other factor.

363
00:16:43.632 --> 00:16:45.552
<v Voiceover>So let's go on to the other factors,</v>

364
00:16:45.552 --> 00:16:47.892
one way or another, we all got here into this world.

365
00:16:47.892 --> 00:16:50.912
Now, let's deal with childhood trauma.

366
00:16:50.912 --> 00:16:53.432
Maybe even, let's kind of chronologically

367
00:16:53.432 --> 00:16:55.432
work our way through, say, childhood abuse.

368
00:16:55.432 --> 00:16:57.552
<v ->Childhood abuse, well, the bonding</v>

369
00:16:57.552 --> 00:17:00.212
and attunement is important; childhood

370
00:17:00.212 --> 00:17:04.312
abuse can be multi-varied, in other words,

371
00:17:04.312 --> 00:17:07.172
the presence of an alcoholic parent,

372
00:17:07.172 --> 00:17:11.092
the presence of a parent with mental illness,

373
00:17:11.092 --> 00:17:13.072
or with other chronic illnesses

374
00:17:13.072 --> 00:17:15.832
that would impede their behavior,

375
00:17:15.832 --> 00:17:18.492
in other words, minor adverse life events

376
00:17:18.492 --> 00:17:21.352
during childhood have a significant

377
00:17:21.352 --> 00:17:24.392
effect on the child as an adult.

378
00:17:24.392 --> 00:17:26.232
There's a study, it's called the ACE Study,

379
00:17:26.232 --> 00:17:28.512
Adverse Childhood Events Study,

380
00:17:28.512 --> 00:17:31.212
was done in the 1990's, early 90's,

381
00:17:31.212 --> 00:17:33.332
and it was a long, longitudinal study

382
00:17:33.332 --> 00:17:35.932
with thousands of participants,

383
00:17:35.932 --> 00:17:40.302
and they looked at outcomes as the extremes,

384
00:17:40.302 --> 00:17:44.362
the major causes of death and disease,

385
00:17:44.362 --> 00:17:46.442
and mental illness and addiction

386
00:17:46.442 --> 00:17:48.242
and substance abuse and the like.

387
00:17:48.242 --> 00:17:49.602
And what they found, that there was

388
00:17:49.602 --> 00:17:51.182
a straight-line correlation between

389
00:17:51.182 --> 00:17:54.002
the volume of adverse negative life events,

390
00:17:54.002 --> 00:17:56.782
which are the minor things we're talking about,

391
00:17:56.782 --> 00:17:59.302
and all of the major causes of death,

392
00:17:59.302 --> 00:18:02.262
mental illness, substance abuse, and the like.

393
00:18:02.262 --> 00:18:04.542
So, clearly the brain is shaped in

394
00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:09.372
childhood by what we consider to be trivial life events.

395
00:18:09.372 --> 00:18:10.852
<v Voiceover>And really, in that first</v>

396
00:18:10.852 --> 00:18:14.312
zero to six year timeframe, which also

397
00:18:14.312 --> 00:18:17.052
affects our physical development,

398
00:18:17.052 --> 00:18:19.532
for example, and what our experience in life is going

399
00:18:19.532 --> 00:18:22.192
to be, not just emotionally but even physically.

400
00:18:22.192 --> 00:18:24.412
<v ->Even physically; our diseases are</v>

401
00:18:24.412 --> 00:18:26.952
determined by our early life experience,

402
00:18:26.952 --> 00:18:29.552
which is a shocking finding, and although

403
00:18:29.552 --> 00:18:31.892
that study is well-known, it's not

404
00:18:31.892 --> 00:18:34.032
well-known in the medical literature,

405
00:18:34.032 --> 00:18:36.332
it's in the behavioral literature.

406
00:18:36.332 --> 00:18:37.472
<v Voiceover>However, there are</v>

407
00:18:37.472 --> 00:18:38.572
enough support groups for children

408
00:18:38.572 --> 00:18:41.132
with alcoholic parents to suggest that

409
00:18:41.132 --> 00:18:44.012
this is fairly prominent in their lives.

410
00:18:44.012 --> 00:18:47.252
Just, certainly point at disturbance.

411
00:18:47.252 --> 00:18:49.432
When we were talking about child abuse,

412
00:18:49.432 --> 00:18:50.772
I was reading in one of your articles

413
00:18:50.772 --> 00:18:52.332
that some of the issues that come

414
00:18:52.332 --> 00:18:54.372
up throughout our lives, as a result

415
00:18:54.372 --> 00:18:56.092
of these early experiences, or even

416
00:18:56.092 --> 00:18:59.412
things like bowel issues and PMS

417
00:18:59.412 --> 00:19:02.092
and fibromyalgia, for example.

418
00:19:02.092 --> 00:19:03.852
Can you talk just a little bit,

419
00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:05.152
'cause I know we've got several more

420
00:19:05.152 --> 00:19:07.952
things to go through, but what happens?

421
00:19:07.952 --> 00:19:09.692
How would you end with PMS issues

422
00:19:09.692 --> 00:19:12.352
or bowel issues or pain issues?

423
00:19:12.352 --> 00:19:17.352
<v ->Right, the primary resource behavior</v>

424
00:19:18.252 --> 00:19:20.033
of a child who is facing a threat

425
00:19:20.033 --> 00:19:25.033
or a trauma is to freeze, like the opossum.

426
00:19:25.092 --> 00:19:26.932
<v Voiceover>Right, frightened, deer in the headlights.</v>

427
00:19:26.932 --> 00:19:29.232
<v ->Right, we call it dissociation.</v>

428
00:19:29.232 --> 00:19:32.392
It's a state that we perceive, perhaps,

429
00:19:32.392 --> 00:19:34.273
when we're frozen, like the opossum

430
00:19:34.273 --> 00:19:35.732
or animal who is helpless and has

431
00:19:35.732 --> 00:19:38.773
gone into the numbing them spots.
<v Voiceover>And little children are helpless.</v>

432
00:19:38.773 --> 00:19:40.912
<v ->And that's the only resource a child has,</v>

433
00:19:40.912 --> 00:19:44.692
and for other interests, that's the resource

434
00:19:44.692 --> 00:19:47.192
that most women tend to do for a variety of

435
00:19:47.192 --> 00:19:51.192
genetic and instinctual reasons.

436
00:19:51.192 --> 00:19:53.112
But infants dissociate and freeze,

437
00:19:53.112 --> 00:19:54.992
if they're threatened as a child.

438
00:19:54.992 --> 00:19:56.592
The more they do that, the more

439
00:19:56.592 --> 00:19:59.472
they will do that throughout their life span.

440
00:19:59.472 --> 00:20:03.592
And if they freeze, as a child, a young adult,

441
00:20:03.592 --> 00:20:06.033
an older adult, they will retain

442
00:20:06.033 --> 00:20:10.513
the traumatic experience that caused that freeze response.

443
00:20:10.513 --> 00:20:12.732
And they will progressively tend to freeze

444
00:20:12.732 --> 00:20:15.392
more likely or dissociate, and

445
00:20:15.392 --> 00:20:17.452
be traumatized throughout the life span.

446
00:20:17.452 --> 00:20:19.312
So what we're seeing, then, is that a

447
00:20:19.312 --> 00:20:23.072
early childhood of adverse childhood events

448
00:20:23.072 --> 00:20:25.832
or abuse will result in exquisite

449
00:20:25.832 --> 00:20:28.293
vulnerability to trauma throughout

450
00:20:28.293 --> 00:20:31.033
the life span, and further expanding

451
00:20:31.033 --> 00:20:33.652
expression of that traumatic tendency.

452
00:20:33.652 --> 00:20:34.592
<v Voiceover>And so, what does that</v>

453
00:20:34.592 --> 00:20:35.872
in effect, do to the nervous system

454
00:20:35.872 --> 00:20:37.732
that will cause all these physical ailments?

455
00:20:37.732 --> 00:20:39.952
<v ->When you freeze, you go into a state</v>

456
00:20:39.952 --> 00:20:42.492
that's predominantly parasympathetic.

457
00:20:42.492 --> 00:20:44.692
Now there's a sympathetic fight-flight nervous system,

458
00:20:44.692 --> 00:20:47.072
there's a parasympathetic nervous system

459
00:20:47.072 --> 00:20:52.072
we think of as being energy, restorative, digesting,

460
00:20:52.612 --> 00:20:56.492
resting, and that sort of thing, but in freeze response,

461
00:20:56.492 --> 00:21:01.152
we are in a state of profound parasympathetic dominance.

462
00:21:01.152 --> 00:21:05.732
And in that parasympathetic state of the freeze response,

463
00:21:05.732 --> 00:21:09.033
we have excessive parasympathetic activity

464
00:21:09.033 --> 00:21:12.732
which means the gut is hyperactive,

465
00:21:12.732 --> 00:21:16.672
the excretions of the gut, as stomach acid are excessive,

466
00:21:16.672 --> 00:21:21.672
an example is the soldier who is cowering in the trench,

467
00:21:22.412 --> 00:21:24.712
in a state of terror, they will often

468
00:21:24.712 --> 00:21:26.632
empty their bowels and their bladder,

469
00:21:26.632 --> 00:21:29.732
because they're in this profound parasympathetic state.

470
00:21:29.732 --> 00:21:31.732
And that's a metaphor for many of these

471
00:21:31.732 --> 00:21:35.232
chronic diseases of what I call 'the freeze.'

472
00:21:35.232 --> 00:21:37.912
Fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome,

473
00:21:37.912 --> 00:21:40.912
gastroesophageal reflux disease,

474
00:21:40.912 --> 00:21:44.372
which you see on the TV all the time with Nexium.

475
00:21:44.372 --> 00:21:46.712
It's a societal illness related to the

476
00:21:46.712 --> 00:21:49.112
chronic dissociative traits of our culture.

477
00:21:49.112 --> 00:21:51.072
<v Voiceover>Stress, and then we enhance</v>

478
00:21:51.072 --> 00:21:53.112
the stress and I've asked many people

479
00:21:53.112 --> 00:21:55.332
I've interviewed this because it's

480
00:21:55.332 --> 00:21:57.572
such a dominant feature of our dietary

481
00:21:57.572 --> 00:21:59.652
patterns in the Western, well, throughout

482
00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:01.533
the world, which is, on top of it,

483
00:22:01.533 --> 00:22:03.492
we jack ourselves up on lots of caffeine.

484
00:22:03.492 --> 00:22:06.912
Now what's that do on top of this, which seems to mimic

485
00:22:06.912 --> 00:22:09.273
all these very things you're talking about?

486
00:22:09.273 --> 00:22:10.332
<v ->Well, you gotta remember that</v>

487
00:22:10.332 --> 00:22:13.013
we're dealing with a cyclical syndrome.

488
00:22:13.013 --> 00:22:15.293
It's a sine wave, all of the universe

489
00:22:15.293 --> 00:22:17.812
operates on this cyclical, cycle -

490
00:22:17.812 --> 00:22:19.872
menstrual cycle, the cycles of the moon,

491
00:22:19.872 --> 00:22:21.793
seasons, it's the way the universe

492
00:22:21.793 --> 00:22:25.592
and our body operates, so, you get

493
00:22:25.592 --> 00:22:28.492
both sympathetic and parasympathetic

494
00:22:28.492 --> 00:22:31.052
symptoms within this, and so stress,

495
00:22:31.052 --> 00:22:34.533
which starts the fight-flight response,

496
00:22:34.533 --> 00:22:37.872
will inevitably cycle down into the freeze response,

497
00:22:37.872 --> 00:22:40.252
and once you begin to increase the

498
00:22:40.252 --> 00:22:45.252
volume of cycling, you get both sides of the symptoms.

499
00:22:46.372 --> 00:22:48.952
So you'll treat the depression weak side

500
00:22:48.952 --> 00:22:51.572
with caffeine, which pumps you up,

501
00:22:51.572 --> 00:22:53.513
but then you get too jazzed up.

502
00:22:53.513 --> 00:22:55.392
So then you smoke a cigarette,

503
00:22:55.392 --> 00:23:00.043
which (laughs) brings you down into the relaxation stage.
<v Voiceover>Or drink some alcohol.</v>

504
00:23:00.043 --> 00:23:04.923
<v ->Or alcohol, or benzodiazepines,</v>

505
00:23:04.923 --> 00:23:07.223
Librium, Valium, Xanax, you know?

506
00:23:07.223 --> 00:23:09.363
So what we're doing is we're constantly

507
00:23:09.363 --> 00:23:11.403
battling the extremes of this cycle

508
00:23:11.403 --> 00:23:13.044
through the substances that we

509
00:23:13.044 --> 00:23:14.504
subject ourselves to through our

510
00:23:14.504 --> 00:23:17.123
daily life to make us feel better.

511
00:23:17.123 --> 00:23:19.403
<v Voiceover>So, is that resulting</v>

512
00:23:19.403 --> 00:23:23.123
in more of the chronic disorders

513
00:23:23.123 --> 00:23:25.444
you're seeing, then, aside from

514
00:23:25.444 --> 00:23:27.183
what we've already experienced in our youth,

515
00:23:27.183 --> 00:23:29.023
we're exacerbating it by our own

516
00:23:29.023 --> 00:23:31.344
intake of these substances?

517
00:23:31.344 --> 00:23:35.784
<v ->We have an epidemic of what we call chronic disease.</v>

518
00:23:35.784 --> 00:23:38.083
And allopathic medicine doesn't know

519
00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:39.843
what to do with that, and you'll read this

520
00:23:39.843 --> 00:23:41.623
in many medical articles, we do

521
00:23:41.623 --> 00:23:43.303
great with the acute diseases and

522
00:23:43.303 --> 00:23:45.503
the trauma, the physical trauma,

523
00:23:45.503 --> 00:23:46.363
but we don't know how to treat

524
00:23:46.363 --> 00:23:48.503
these chronic diseases; it's because

525
00:23:48.503 --> 00:23:51.643
we don't have a concept of where they're coming from.

526
00:23:51.643 --> 00:23:53.224
And they're coming from the little

527
00:23:53.224 --> 00:23:55.883
traumas that we expose ourselves to

528
00:23:55.883 --> 00:23:59.443
in this kind of culture, including we are

529
00:23:59.443 --> 00:24:01.703
exposed to in everyday life, and

530
00:24:01.703 --> 00:24:03.583
I write about that, that the trauma

531
00:24:03.583 --> 00:24:06.783
isn't just rape, incest, torture,

532
00:24:06.783 --> 00:24:10.343
terrorism, combat; trauma is any

533
00:24:10.343 --> 00:24:13.284
life stress that occurs in a state of helplessness,

534
00:24:13.284 --> 00:24:15.523
because that is the definition of trauma,

535
00:24:15.523 --> 00:24:18.203
a life threat when one is helpless.

536
00:24:18.203 --> 00:24:21.903
The absence of control defines the state of trauma.

537
00:24:21.903 --> 00:24:25.083
And if you face, for instance, gender discrimination

538
00:24:25.083 --> 00:24:27.724
or racial discrimination, and you are unable

539
00:24:27.724 --> 00:24:29.903
to respond to it in a way that protects you,

540
00:24:29.903 --> 00:24:32.083
that constitutes a trauma.

541
00:24:32.083 --> 00:24:33.224
<v Voiceover>And my understanding</v>

542
00:24:33.224 --> 00:24:37.484
is that is culturally, not culture-specific,

543
00:24:37.484 --> 00:24:41.563
in that, the female produces considerably

544
00:24:41.563 --> 00:24:46.563
less serotonin than the male in virtually every culture.

545
00:24:46.723 --> 00:24:48.384
Can you speak to that for a moment?

546
00:24:48.384 --> 00:24:50.103
And then I wanna get into a little

547
00:24:50.103 --> 00:24:51.704
bit about the whole sexual issue,

548
00:24:51.704 --> 00:24:55.483
sexual abuse, slash, leading to prostitution and so forth.

549
00:24:55.483 --> 00:24:58.023
<v ->Oh yes, recapitulation.</v>

550
00:24:58.023 --> 00:25:02.583
Women are designed, in the face of threat,

551
00:25:02.583 --> 00:25:05.104
to dissociate or freeze; there are

552
00:25:05.104 --> 00:25:07.223
cultural implications from the tribal

553
00:25:07.223 --> 00:25:08.623
examples, and this comes from the work of

554
00:25:08.623 --> 00:25:13.623
Richard Leakey, and a psychologist named Bruce Perry,

555
00:25:13.763 --> 00:25:15.184
and I think it's a compelling theory,

556
00:25:15.184 --> 00:25:17.683
if the children and the women in a tribe

557
00:25:17.683 --> 00:25:19.943
invaded by another hostile tribe,

558
00:25:19.943 --> 00:25:24.763
try to run, try to flee, or fight, they would be killed.

559
00:25:24.763 --> 00:25:29.343
If the men did not fight, they would be killed.

560
00:25:29.343 --> 00:25:32.003
So, women and men and children are

561
00:25:32.003 --> 00:25:36.403
genetically wired to respond differently to a threat,

562
00:25:36.403 --> 00:25:39.663
and women and children are designed to freeze,

563
00:25:39.663 --> 00:25:41.543
because then they are captured if their

564
00:25:41.543 --> 00:25:43.003
tribe is defeated and taken into the

565
00:25:43.003 --> 00:25:46.743
tribe of slaves and contribute to the gene pool.

566
00:25:46.743 --> 00:25:49.023
It's kind of a harsh way to look at it,

567
00:25:49.023 --> 00:25:51.723
but it's the survival instinct.
<v Voiceover>And it's still translating into</v>

568
00:25:51.723 --> 00:25:55.184
our genetic or our societal factors today.

569
00:25:55.184 --> 00:25:57.064
<v ->Right, which probably explains</v>

570
00:25:57.064 --> 00:25:59.623
the three-to-one incidence of women to men

571
00:25:59.623 --> 00:26:03.484
who develop PTSD, the initial syndrome of trauma,

572
00:26:03.484 --> 00:26:05.143
and we tend to develop the disease

573
00:26:05.143 --> 00:26:07.683
as the freeze, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel,

574
00:26:07.683 --> 00:26:12.683
all these predominantly feminine, women syndromes.

575
00:26:12.943 --> 00:26:17.506
Men get them, but with less frequency.

576
00:26:17.506 --> 00:26:18.963
<v Voiceover>Right, what about the notion of</v>

577
00:26:18.963 --> 00:26:21.923
or the subject of sexual abuse in youth,

578
00:26:21.923 --> 00:26:24.623
and what happens there as a part of that cycle?

579
00:26:24.623 --> 00:26:26.984
<v ->As a part of that cycle, again,</v>

580
00:26:26.984 --> 00:26:28.643
the victims are predominantly women,

581
00:26:28.643 --> 00:26:31.303
probably four to one or more, simply

582
00:26:31.303 --> 00:26:35.574
by virtue they are more likely to be victimized.

583
00:26:35.574 --> 00:26:39.194
And the perpetrators are more likely to be male.

584
00:26:39.194 --> 00:26:44.194
That, of course, is a repetitive trauma

585
00:26:44.654 --> 00:26:47.074
of intense degree, both with regards

586
00:26:47.074 --> 00:26:50.054
to the body experiences and also the

587
00:26:50.054 --> 00:26:51.734
terror that's involved with it.

588
00:26:51.734 --> 00:26:54.514
And so the physical and sexual abuse

589
00:26:54.514 --> 00:26:56.414
are probably the most profound

590
00:26:56.414 --> 00:26:58.954
traumas that one can have, also

591
00:26:58.954 --> 00:27:02.714
because they're executed by the caregiver,

592
00:27:02.714 --> 00:27:06.734
the only safe person, and an infant

593
00:27:06.734 --> 00:27:10.534
or a child who is traumatized by a parent,

594
00:27:10.534 --> 00:27:14.354
basically, cannot blame the parent,

595
00:27:14.354 --> 00:27:16.554
because there's nowhere else to flee,

596
00:27:16.554 --> 00:27:18.514
nowhere else to go, and so they

597
00:27:18.514 --> 00:27:19.794
tend to incorporate it as being

598
00:27:19.794 --> 00:27:23.534
a signal of their own deficiency.

599
00:27:23.534 --> 00:27:25.414
And they blame themselves, and

600
00:27:25.414 --> 00:27:28.174
when one asks a trauma victim about that,

601
00:27:28.174 --> 00:27:31.634
they often will say, "No, I didn't have any trauma."

602
00:27:31.634 --> 00:27:33.334
"Well did your mother or father hit you?"

603
00:27:33.334 --> 00:27:34.434
"Oh, yeah," "How often?"

604
00:27:34.434 --> 00:27:38.654
"Every day, but there was no trauma 'cause I deserved it."

605
00:27:38.654 --> 00:27:40.994
<v Voiceover>I deserved it, I was a bad boy or a bad girl.</v>

606
00:27:40.994 --> 00:27:44.414
<v ->So there's a tendency of a child to internalize it, and--
<v Voiceover>And then how does that</v>

607
00:27:44.414 --> 00:27:46.894
play itself out throughout their lifetimes?

608
00:27:46.894 --> 00:27:49.534
<v ->What happens is a phenomenon that is</v>

609
00:27:49.534 --> 00:27:54.534
part of the fact that trauma is a conditioned response.

610
00:27:54.594 --> 00:27:57.645
It's like the dog salivating at the bell,

611
00:27:57.645 --> 00:28:01.945
one learns to respond to threats

612
00:28:01.945 --> 00:28:03.505
with a conditioned response that then

613
00:28:03.505 --> 00:28:05.964
perpetuates itself throughout the life span,

614
00:28:05.964 --> 00:28:09.664
and one will often seek the type

615
00:28:09.664 --> 00:28:11.004
of behavior that one experienced,

616
00:28:11.004 --> 00:28:13.004
even though it was negative, because

617
00:28:13.004 --> 00:28:17.844
that is interpreted as the way things should be.

618
00:28:17.844 --> 00:28:20.204
And so we are attracted, often, to

619
00:28:20.204 --> 00:28:23.185
characteristics in people of the opposite sex

620
00:28:23.185 --> 00:28:26.544
who replicate the behaviors of the caregiver,

621
00:28:26.544 --> 00:28:29.304
including the negative behaviors.

622
00:28:29.304 --> 00:28:30.704
And this produces what's called the

623
00:28:30.704 --> 00:28:34.384
repetition compulsion or traumatic recapitulation -

624
00:28:34.384 --> 00:28:37.764
the tendency to replicate in our choices

625
00:28:37.764 --> 00:28:42.344
the behaviors, experiences, professions,

626
00:28:42.344 --> 00:28:45.064
activities that we experienced as a child

627
00:28:45.064 --> 00:28:47.544
which actually are destructive.

628
00:28:47.544 --> 00:28:48.484
<v Voiceover>So if you're in a marriage</v>

629
00:28:48.484 --> 00:28:51.384
that has violence at the core, domestic violence,

630
00:28:51.384 --> 00:28:53.464
would you say that in a very large

631
00:28:53.464 --> 00:28:55.484
percentage of those cases where the women

632
00:28:55.484 --> 00:28:57.784
stay in that situation, it's because

633
00:28:57.784 --> 00:29:00.064
they were conditioned to this at an earlier age?

634
00:29:00.064 --> 00:29:01.384
<v ->Hundred percent.</v>

635
00:29:01.384 --> 00:29:03.204
<v Voiceover>Hundred percent, there ya go.</v>

636
00:29:03.204 --> 00:29:05.455
<v ->That's why the behavior is so inexplicable,</v>

637
00:29:05.455 --> 00:29:09.234
and why people who care for or support

638
00:29:09.234 --> 00:29:12.914
women of physical abuse are frustrated

639
00:29:12.914 --> 00:29:17.914
by the inability of that woman to leave the environment,

640
00:29:18.394 --> 00:29:21.894
and the tendency to go back into it again.

641
00:29:21.894 --> 00:29:23.414
Because there are rewards systems

642
00:29:23.414 --> 00:29:26.694
in this process; trauma is endorphinergic,

643
00:29:26.694 --> 00:29:30.134
we get a flood of endorphins in our brain,

644
00:29:30.134 --> 00:29:33.454
it helps us to avoid collapsing,

645
00:29:33.454 --> 00:29:36.135
it allows us to pursue the fight and flight response

646
00:29:36.135 --> 00:29:38.374
without feeling the pain, so those

647
00:29:38.374 --> 00:29:40.274
reward systems continue to operate

648
00:29:40.274 --> 00:29:42.534
throughout the lifespan in facing those

649
00:29:42.534 --> 00:29:44.674
kinds of, what we would think would be,

650
00:29:44.674 --> 00:29:46.894
situations we'd try to leave.

651
00:29:46.894 --> 00:29:48.615
<v Voiceover>What about self-inflicted,</v>

652
00:29:48.615 --> 00:29:50.934
then, harm or trauma to ourselves,

653
00:29:50.934 --> 00:29:52.555
which, we had a little conversation

654
00:29:52.555 --> 00:29:54.454
last night when we were talking about

655
00:29:54.454 --> 00:29:56.894
the ways in which we abuse ourselves.

656
00:29:56.894 --> 00:29:58.014
And one of them that you brought

657
00:29:58.014 --> 00:30:00.975
up, surprisingly, is extreme sports.

658
00:30:00.975 --> 00:30:02.654
I probably would go for extreme anything,

659
00:30:02.654 --> 00:30:04.034
but you say even extreme sports,

660
00:30:04.034 --> 00:30:06.094
what if someone indulges in extreme

661
00:30:06.094 --> 00:30:08.834
sports, what is this indicating?

662
00:30:08.834 --> 00:30:12.114
<v ->Well, the sch-war-sh literature</v>

663
00:30:12.114 --> 00:30:13.934
would suggest that they're adrenaline

664
00:30:13.934 --> 00:30:16.854
junkies, they love the adrenaline rush,

665
00:30:16.854 --> 00:30:19.794
what they love is the endorphin rush,

666
00:30:19.794 --> 00:30:22.174
because when you're in an extreme sport

667
00:30:22.174 --> 00:30:24.874
where there is a threat and a danger,

668
00:30:24.874 --> 00:30:26.434
your brain will prepare you for that

669
00:30:26.434 --> 00:30:28.094
by secreting endorphins, because

670
00:30:28.094 --> 00:30:29.754
if you're injured, it will allow you

671
00:30:29.754 --> 00:30:32.154
to continue and complete the act.

672
00:30:32.154 --> 00:30:34.094
That's what soldiers experience,

673
00:30:34.094 --> 00:30:37.384
they're filled with endorphins.
<v Voiceover>And that's what we're going to next, combat.</v>

674
00:30:37.384 --> 00:30:39.994
<v ->Right, combat, combat is an endorphinergic</v>

675
00:30:39.994 --> 00:30:43.744
state, and some soldiers will literally

676
00:30:43.744 --> 00:30:45.884
get addicted to that re-up, continue

677
00:30:45.884 --> 00:30:49.344
to return to the scene of battle because of that process,

678
00:30:49.344 --> 00:30:52.804
and so will an extreme sports enthusiast,

679
00:30:52.804 --> 00:30:54.705
and usually, the ones who do that

680
00:30:54.705 --> 00:30:56.045
are conditioned to do that by virtue

681
00:30:56.045 --> 00:30:57.304
of the fact that's what they did

682
00:30:57.304 --> 00:31:00.544
when they were children, when they were abused.

683
00:31:00.544 --> 00:31:01.704
And there's a high incidence of

684
00:31:01.704 --> 00:31:05.264
early childhood abuse in males

685
00:31:05.264 --> 00:31:10.264
usually abuse by father, both in criminals,

686
00:31:10.344 --> 00:31:12.744
our jails are filled with violence

687
00:31:12.744 --> 00:31:14.484
related to that experience, where

688
00:31:14.484 --> 00:31:16.305
they were rewarded by the endorphins

689
00:31:16.305 --> 00:31:18.724
within the process, and in soldiers

690
00:31:18.724 --> 00:31:22.844
who re-up, and in women victims

691
00:31:22.844 --> 00:31:24.624
of child abuse who continue to

692
00:31:24.624 --> 00:31:27.264
go back to the scene of the crime,

693
00:31:27.264 --> 00:31:29.724
and in sports enthusiasts, who find

694
00:31:29.724 --> 00:31:33.304
that the exposure to the risk produces

695
00:31:33.304 --> 00:31:35.944
this rush of satisfaction.
<v Voiceover>Even though they're not the ones</v>

696
00:31:35.944 --> 00:31:39.364
on the line, just in observation of it.

697
00:31:39.364 --> 00:31:40.704
And how might this pertain to other

698
00:31:40.704 --> 00:31:44.244
aspects of life other than being in a sporting stadium?

699
00:31:44.244 --> 00:31:45.884
<v ->Well, I would maintain that this</v>

700
00:31:45.884 --> 00:31:50.884
reflex, this thing, determines a lot of our social behavior.

701
00:31:51.004 --> 00:31:54.404
This process of seeking endorphin release,

702
00:31:54.404 --> 00:31:56.464
for an experience that otherwise has

703
00:31:56.464 --> 00:32:00.104
links to prior trauma, and I think

704
00:32:00.104 --> 00:32:01.944
it explains a lot of our behavior

705
00:32:01.944 --> 00:32:05.244
including violence in video games,

706
00:32:05.244 --> 00:32:06.624
the rush that one gets with these

707
00:32:06.624 --> 00:32:11.624
kinds of activities, the fact that CSI

708
00:32:11.634 --> 00:32:14.534
is the number one show on TV, which

709
00:32:14.534 --> 00:32:17.874
has these inputs of violent figures

710
00:32:17.874 --> 00:32:21.114
of tissues being disrupted by knives and bullets

711
00:32:21.114 --> 00:32:24.374
with the sucking sounds of the tissue,

712
00:32:24.374 --> 00:32:26.014
it's just absolutely disgusting,

713
00:32:26.014 --> 00:32:28.654
but which is endorphinergic to

714
00:32:28.654 --> 00:32:33.594
those people who find that that relieves anxiety.

715
00:32:33.594 --> 00:32:34.574
<v Voiceover>So I don't know if you're</v>

716
00:32:34.574 --> 00:32:36.414
willing to go into this particular arena, but,

717
00:32:36.414 --> 00:32:40.274
it's the chicken or the egg, you know, we have a war going.

718
00:32:40.274 --> 00:32:41.794
<v ->Now we have a war going.</v>

719
00:32:41.794 --> 00:32:44.115
<v Voiceover>And now we're becoming junkies for</v>

720
00:32:44.115 --> 00:32:46.354
that kind of news and the images and so forth.

721
00:32:46.354 --> 00:32:49.974
<v ->We are, but we are, I think,</v>

722
00:32:49.974 --> 00:32:52.914
a nation of dissociated people.

723
00:32:52.914 --> 00:32:55.994
Number one, we've abandoned childhood

724
00:32:55.994 --> 00:32:58.634
attunement to our birthing methods,

725
00:32:58.634 --> 00:33:00.254
through early childhood abandonment

726
00:33:00.254 --> 00:33:03.794
through daycare before the age of six months,

727
00:33:03.794 --> 00:33:06.574
through two-parent-working family

728
00:33:06.574 --> 00:33:08.434
and people in the audience get very

729
00:33:08.434 --> 00:33:11.254
upset when I say this, and I think

730
00:33:11.254 --> 00:33:13.734
that has created a nation of people

731
00:33:13.734 --> 00:33:16.594
who tend to dissociate in the face of threat,

732
00:33:16.594 --> 00:33:19.574
which we did five years ago, and

733
00:33:19.574 --> 00:33:22.034
we have not come out of that yet.

734
00:33:22.034 --> 00:33:25.414
And as a result, we are very prone

735
00:33:25.414 --> 00:33:30.174
to fear-based control with what

736
00:33:30.174 --> 00:33:31.754
we know to be messages that are

737
00:33:31.754 --> 00:33:34.094
repetitive and aren't saying anything new,

738
00:33:34.094 --> 00:33:36.814
but that unconscious--
<v Voiceover>They may not even be truthful.</v>

739
00:33:36.814 --> 00:33:37.974
<v ->Doesn't matter whether they're</v>

740
00:33:37.974 --> 00:33:40.334
truthful because we are reinforced by

741
00:33:40.334 --> 00:33:43.954
the brain response to that news.

742
00:33:43.954 --> 00:33:44.834
<v Voiceover>Well, I think we've kinda</v>

743
00:33:44.834 --> 00:33:47.154
tripped through all the areas that create trauma,

744
00:33:47.154 --> 00:33:49.354
how do we get rid of the trauma?

745
00:33:49.354 --> 00:33:53.074
How do we balance that back out again?

746
00:33:53.074 --> 00:33:55.314
<v ->We are going to have to make</v>

747
00:33:55.314 --> 00:33:59.594
a great cultural shift to do that.

748
00:33:59.594 --> 00:34:02.254
We can't treat the nation with

749
00:34:02.254 --> 00:34:04.934
individual trauma therapy, we need

750
00:34:04.934 --> 00:34:07.434
to have a change in the perception

751
00:34:07.434 --> 00:34:09.914
of the world as it is with regards

752
00:34:09.914 --> 00:34:12.174
to safety or danger, we need to

753
00:34:12.174 --> 00:34:15.734
change our patterns of behavior within the culture.

754
00:34:15.734 --> 00:34:17.434
Because the institutions of a culture

755
00:34:17.434 --> 00:34:20.274
define the controls that make us helpless.

756
00:34:20.274 --> 00:34:21.654
And if we're helpless, we will continue

757
00:34:21.654 --> 00:34:25.134
to be traumatized by minor negative life events.

758
00:34:25.134 --> 00:34:27.854
So we may need to make a huge cultural shift.

759
00:34:27.854 --> 00:34:29.714
Within the field of treating trauma,

760
00:34:29.714 --> 00:34:32.394
we define methods that work that are

761
00:34:32.394 --> 00:34:34.534
based on all the messages within our

762
00:34:34.534 --> 00:34:36.834
body that trauma produces, and many

763
00:34:36.834 --> 00:34:39.294
of these messages are what we call

764
00:34:39.294 --> 00:34:41.654
somatic or body-based messages,

765
00:34:41.654 --> 00:34:45.874
which are generally ignored by standard psychotherapy.

766
00:34:45.874 --> 00:34:48.974
And when you treat PTSD as the defining

767
00:34:48.974 --> 00:34:53.314
syndrome for trauma, you're missing the boat.

768
00:34:53.314 --> 00:34:55.674
And unless you treat it as this whole

769
00:34:55.674 --> 00:34:57.854
spectrum of events including the

770
00:34:57.854 --> 00:34:59.954
freeze response and the diseases of

771
00:34:59.954 --> 00:35:01.854
trauma that we talked about, you

772
00:35:01.854 --> 00:35:06.854
will never cure the syndrome, you have to change the brain.

773
00:35:06.874 --> 00:35:09.114
<v Voiceover>Yes, change the brain,</v>

774
00:35:09.114 --> 00:35:11.214
and it seems like there's a very interesting

775
00:35:11.214 --> 00:35:13.594
end roads being made in changing the brain.

776
00:35:13.594 --> 00:35:17.994
We did an interview with Lee Gerdes

777
00:35:17.994 --> 00:35:19.534
in Brain State Technology, and that

778
00:35:19.534 --> 00:35:20.694
certainly seems to be one of the

779
00:35:20.694 --> 00:35:21.914
big breakthroughs and now you're

780
00:35:21.914 --> 00:35:24.054
becoming familiar with Lee's work as well.

781
00:35:24.054 --> 00:35:25.614
<v ->Yes, right, that's correct.</v>

782
00:35:25.614 --> 00:35:28.574
<v Voiceover>Any final thoughts</v>

783
00:35:28.574 --> 00:35:31.494
from your perspective, a lifelong

784
00:35:31.494 --> 00:35:34.014
study of the brain and trauma, of

785
00:35:34.014 --> 00:35:35.914
immediate things we can do as human

786
00:35:35.914 --> 00:35:40.014
beings to stop this chain of events now?

787
00:35:40.014 --> 00:35:41.894
You have, say, a grandchild coming

788
00:35:41.894 --> 00:35:44.294
into the world, what can we effectively

789
00:35:44.294 --> 00:35:46.914
do if you were going to lay it out, you know,

790
00:35:46.914 --> 00:35:50.114
Bob's Rules, one, two, three, four, five,

791
00:35:50.114 --> 00:35:51.354
what are the five things you would

792
00:35:51.354 --> 00:35:55.614
tell those new parents right now?

793
00:35:55.614 --> 00:35:58.974
<v ->We need to change the way we</v>

794
00:35:58.974 --> 00:36:02.174
birth and raise our children; we

795
00:36:02.174 --> 00:36:03.674
need to understand that the children

796
00:36:03.674 --> 00:36:06.194
are the ultimate resources in our society,

797
00:36:06.194 --> 00:36:10.994
and that they will be the source we can change.

798
00:36:10.994 --> 00:36:12.354
Because it's gonna be hard to change

799
00:36:12.354 --> 00:36:17.354
all of us, from young adults to my age,

800
00:36:18.034 --> 00:36:19.895
without dramatic treatment, which

801
00:36:19.895 --> 00:36:22.354
I'm going to be exploring in this context

802
00:36:22.354 --> 00:36:25.535
of Brain State Tech, but I think we

803
00:36:25.535 --> 00:36:27.674
need to look at our child-rearing practices

804
00:36:27.674 --> 00:36:30.694
and to do that, we need to change

805
00:36:30.694 --> 00:36:34.394
the culture, value systems that

806
00:36:34.394 --> 00:36:38.634
require a two-parent working family, and we need

807
00:36:38.634 --> 00:36:42.614
to find a way to deal with nurturing the children.

808
00:36:42.614 --> 00:36:44.554
We need to look within the culture

809
00:36:44.554 --> 00:36:49.374
at the norms that we accept as being optimal,

810
00:36:49.374 --> 00:36:53.734
including having the things that we have,

811
00:36:53.734 --> 00:36:55.594
including exposing ourselves to

812
00:36:55.594 --> 00:36:58.134
the entertainment that we have,

813
00:36:58.134 --> 00:37:00.594
and I'm not someone who wants to

814
00:37:00.594 --> 00:37:03.094
turn off violence in the movies,

815
00:37:03.094 --> 00:37:04.535
we need to mitigate it, we need to

816
00:37:04.535 --> 00:37:08.994
look at what it does, we need a shift

817
00:37:08.994 --> 00:37:11.814
in our cultural values, and again,

818
00:37:11.814 --> 00:37:15.334
this has to do with the brain-based

819
00:37:15.334 --> 00:37:17.674
things that I'm talking about,

820
00:37:17.674 --> 00:37:20.954
not just getting rid of pornography

821
00:37:20.954 --> 00:37:22.714
and these kinds of things; we need

822
00:37:22.714 --> 00:37:25.734
to look at the amount of arousal

823
00:37:25.734 --> 00:37:27.614
that we produce in our society.

824
00:37:27.614 --> 00:37:28.554
<v Voiceover>That we seem to be</v>

825
00:37:28.554 --> 00:37:30.114
upping the bar every year on the

826
00:37:30.114 --> 00:37:33.214
amount of arousal that's required to keep us somehow

827
00:37:33.214 --> 00:37:35.934
tuned in, dialed in, or attentive to our lives.

828
00:37:35.934 --> 00:37:37.614
<v ->Exactly.</v>

829
00:37:37.614 --> 00:37:40.254
<v Voiceover>Yeah, well, this has</v>

830
00:37:40.254 --> 00:37:45.254
been extremely helpful, thank you so much for your time.
<v ->Thank you, it's a pleasure.</v>

831
00:37:46.714 --> 00:37:48.254
<v ->The good news here is that there</v>

832
00:37:48.254 --> 00:37:50.054
are techniques we can use to help

833
00:37:50.054 --> 00:37:52.035
release our life traumas, which

834
00:37:52.035 --> 00:37:54.634
we will be featuring in the work of David Berceli,

835
00:37:54.634 --> 00:37:56.374
Dr. Scaer has also created an alliance

836
00:37:56.374 --> 00:37:59.414
with Lee Gerdes, stating that Brain State

837
00:37:59.414 --> 00:38:01.655
Technologies offers a major piece

838
00:38:01.655 --> 00:38:03.655
of the puzzle in reestablishing

839
00:38:03.655 --> 00:38:06.214
equilibrium in our lives; for more on that,

840
00:38:06.214 --> 00:38:08.155
take a look at our interview with Lee Gerdes.

841
00:38:08.155 --> 00:38:11.655
Until next time, thanks for watching.

842
00:38:11.655 --> 00:38:16.424
(relaxing music)
