00:00:00.442 --> 00:00:03.305
<v ->As a former employee of Lawrence Livermore Laboratories,</v>

2
00:00:03.305 --> 00:00:05.440
Leuren Moret stumbled across information

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.024
that was so disturbing to her

4
00:00:07.024 --> 00:00:08.452
that she quit her profession

5
00:00:08.452 --> 00:00:09.996
and became a whistle blower.

6
00:00:09.996 --> 00:00:12.130
Her subsequent research has shown the horrors

7
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.080
of radiation exposure to soldiers

8
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.686
of the Persian Gulf War,

9
00:00:15.686 --> 00:00:17.311
and their future offspring.

10
00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:19.058
She has pointed to the sharp rises

11
00:00:19.058 --> 00:00:20.784
in diabetes and cancer

12
00:00:20.784 --> 00:00:22.918
in areas near nuclear facilities.

13
00:00:22.918 --> 00:00:24.889
More over, she says this problem

14
00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:26.839
of epidemic proportions

15
00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.771
is in each of our own backyards.

16
00:00:38.336 --> 00:00:40.147
<v Voiceover>This is a subject that seems</v>

17
00:00:40.147 --> 00:00:42.280
we all should have been far better educated about

18
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.723
by now than what we are.

19
00:00:43.723 --> 00:00:46.262
Which is virtually no education.

20
00:00:46.262 --> 00:00:49.046
And you've been out there trying for,

21
00:00:49.046 --> 00:00:49.918
how many years now?

22
00:00:49.918 --> 00:00:52.572
Since 1991?
<v ->That's right.</v>

23
00:00:52.572 --> 00:00:54.288
<v Voiceover>1991 you started telling the public</v>

24
00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:56.746
and waving red flags all over the place.

25
00:00:56.746 --> 00:00:59.143
So let's start with a primer course on

26
00:00:59.143 --> 00:01:02.943
radiation poisoning and depleted uranium.

27
00:01:02.943 --> 00:01:03.633
Okay?

28
00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:04.670
I mean, something everybody wants

29
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.539
to know about, right?

30
00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:07.697
<v ->Right.
<v Voiceover>So let's</v>

31
00:01:07.697 --> 00:01:08.672
start at the beginning.

32
00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:10.582
So you were giving us a lecture.

33
00:01:10.582 --> 00:01:12.856
<v ->Well then let's start in World War II</v>

34
00:01:12.856 --> 00:01:15.498
and talk about the Manhattan Project.

35
00:01:15.498 --> 00:01:16.799
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->And that was</v>

36
00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.374
a secret project conducted by the US government

37
00:01:20.374 --> 00:01:23.849
and the shadow government, in other words,

38
00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:27.525
the Wall Street interest and the Yale University

39
00:01:27.525 --> 00:01:32.143
Skull and Bones, to develop atomic bombs.

40
00:01:32.402 --> 00:01:36.418
And US government, because they were advised

41
00:01:36.554 --> 00:01:39.255
by German refugee scientists,

42
00:01:39.255 --> 00:01:43.400
that Germany was developing a nuclear bomb,

43
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.964
an atomic bomb.

44
00:01:44.964 --> 00:01:48.039
The US waned to have one also.

45
00:01:48.534 --> 00:01:52.732
And it was Einstein, at the urging of

46
00:01:53.457 --> 00:01:56.118
three other Hungarian scientists,

47
00:01:56.118 --> 00:01:59.721
Savard, Edward Teller,

48
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.363
and Frank,

49
00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:07.049
they convinced Einstein that he should write a letter

50
00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.817
to President Truman

51
00:02:08.817 --> 00:02:12.886
and urge him to develop the atomic bomb.

52
00:02:13.164 --> 00:02:16.334
Which Einstein later regretted in his life.

53
00:02:16.334 --> 00:02:18.020
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->Now in order</v>

54
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.598
to do this they needed uranium 235,

55
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.889
which is an isotope of uranium that will fission,

56
00:02:28.463 --> 00:02:30.942
or will suddenly release all its energy

57
00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:34.111
from the nucleus in a cascade

58
00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:36.915
which can make a nuclear explosion.

59
00:02:36.915 --> 00:02:41.269
And, or, they could do it with plutonium.

60
00:02:41.344 --> 00:02:44.270
Well, they had uranium 235

61
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.998
because it occurs in nature,

62
00:02:45.998 --> 00:02:48.089
but they didn't have plutonium.

63
00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:51.848
So they needed to actually

64
00:02:51.848 --> 00:02:53.941
build a small reactor,

65
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:58.228
which Fermi built at the University of Chicago,

66
00:02:58.228 --> 00:03:02.927
under the bleacher stand out on the soccer field.

67
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.257
Because they knew the fission products

68
00:03:05.257 --> 00:03:08.731
that would be released were extremely dangerous.

69
00:03:08.731 --> 00:03:12.470
And they didn't want to expose the lab workers

70
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.217
and the people around them.

71
00:03:14.217 --> 00:03:15.334
<v Voiceover>Just the athletes.</v>

72
00:03:15.334 --> 00:03:15.985
<v ->That's right.</v>

73
00:03:15.985 --> 00:03:18.138
Yeah, just the athletes, and the spectators. (laughs)

74
00:03:18.138 --> 00:03:19.081
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->You know we're</v>

75
00:03:19.081 --> 00:03:21.337
always getting them right? (laughs)

76
00:03:21.337 --> 00:03:25.170
So Fermi built the

77
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.972
first reactor called the Pile.

78
00:03:27.972 --> 00:03:31.751
And the Manhattan Project

79
00:03:32.181 --> 00:03:35.814
was actually laid out one night

80
00:03:35.814 --> 00:03:39.491
at The Bohemian Club in San Fransisco.

81
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:43.433
And Ernest Lawrence was a very promising physicist

82
00:03:43.433 --> 00:03:46.684
at Yale University, and he was hired by

83
00:03:46.684 --> 00:03:50.103
the University of California in the 30s.

84
00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:53.307
Now, he wanted to build a cyclatron,

85
00:03:53.307 --> 00:03:56.497
to do experimental nuclear physics,

86
00:03:56.497 --> 00:04:00.912
but money from the government was very scarce

87
00:04:01.332 --> 00:04:03.648
so he went to The Bohemian Club,

88
00:04:03.648 --> 00:04:05.355
he was made a member almost

89
00:04:05.355 --> 00:04:07.834
before he even got to California.

90
00:04:07.834 --> 00:04:11.822
And he asked the business men there

91
00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:14.680
to give him the money to make his

92
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.814
first six inch cyclatron.

93
00:04:16.814 --> 00:04:18.784
Before that was even finished he went back

94
00:04:18.784 --> 00:04:21.527
and asked for more money to make a 10 inch one,

95
00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:23.986
and that was the beginning of big science.

96
00:04:23.986 --> 00:04:27.895
And he was trying to

97
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:30.020
make thistle materials

98
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.783
that would fission to build the bomb.

99
00:04:32.783 --> 00:04:34.632
He couldn't really figure out,

100
00:04:34.632 --> 00:04:36.318
he couldn't quite make it work,

101
00:04:36.318 --> 00:04:39.162
although the government had asked him to do that.

102
00:04:39.162 --> 00:04:42.780
So he took Robert Oppenheimer one night,

103
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.375
who was an outstanding theoretical physicist,

104
00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:48.346
especially mathematician,

105
00:04:48.346 --> 00:04:50.987
and he took him to The Bohemian Club

106
00:04:50.987 --> 00:04:53.872
and Oppenheimer laid out the whole plan that night

107
00:04:53.872 --> 00:04:55.050
on a table.

108
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.525
The next morning it was called The Manhattan Project.

109
00:04:58.525 --> 00:05:00.800
And General Leslie Groves

110
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.666
of the US Army was assigned as the head of it.

111
00:05:05.168 --> 00:05:10.111
Now, in order to get the uranium 235 that they needed

112
00:05:10.532 --> 00:05:13.681
to make the core of the atomic bomb,

113
00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:17.365
they had to get natural uranium.

114
00:05:17.623 --> 00:05:21.280
And a lot of it came from the Belgium Congo

115
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.063
where the richest uranium deposits

116
00:05:24.063 --> 00:05:26.968
in the world were located.

117
00:05:26.968 --> 00:05:30.327
That war was over 50% uranium.

118
00:05:31.113 --> 00:05:34.668
And so you

119
00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:38.549
cannot separate uranium isotopes

120
00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:41.292
chemically, because they all have the same

121
00:05:41.292 --> 00:05:43.953
number of electrons in the outer shell.

122
00:05:43.953 --> 00:05:46.412
But they have a different mass in the nucleus,

123
00:05:46.412 --> 00:05:47.712
slightly different.

124
00:05:47.712 --> 00:05:51.633
So what they did, was they mined the uranium,

125
00:05:51.633 --> 00:05:54.315
extracted the metal.

126
00:05:54.315 --> 00:05:56.347
Three isotopes occur in nature,

127
00:05:56.347 --> 00:05:58.175
always in the same ratio because

128
00:05:58.175 --> 00:06:00.227
of different half lives.

129
00:06:00.227 --> 00:06:03.867
And only .72%

130
00:06:03.867 --> 00:06:06.119
of what occurs in nature

131
00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:08.685
is uranium 235.

132
00:06:08.842 --> 00:06:12.728
And all the rest is almost all uranium 238,

133
00:06:13.027 --> 00:06:17.097
and there's just a tiny, tiny amount of uranium 234.

134
00:06:17.354 --> 00:06:21.052
So in order to separate out the U-235,

135
00:06:21.052 --> 00:06:23.287
which is what they wanted for the bombs,

136
00:06:23.287 --> 00:06:25.542
and for the reactor core,

137
00:06:25.542 --> 00:06:29.998
they had to turn all of the uranium metal

138
00:06:30.215 --> 00:06:34.366
into uranium hexafluoride gas.

139
00:06:35.294 --> 00:06:37.367
And pass it through membranes

140
00:06:37.367 --> 00:06:39.358
and they could separate out

141
00:06:39.358 --> 00:06:42.838
just half a percent of U-235.

142
00:06:42.852 --> 00:06:45.880
<v Voiceover>But what's left is not exactly non-toxic.</v>

143
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.558
<v ->It's 99.5% is radioactive trash.</v>

144
00:06:50.558 --> 00:06:51.385
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->Because it won't</v>

145
00:06:51.385 --> 00:06:55.307
fission, and that's called depleted uranium.

146
00:06:55.307 --> 00:06:59.675
Because it's depleted of the U-235.

147
00:06:59.675 --> 00:07:01.808
<v Voiceover>In here now, this may be a quick aside</v>

148
00:07:01.808 --> 00:07:04.226
and irrelevant, or it may not.

149
00:07:04.226 --> 00:07:06.176
At that time you said you were mentioning

150
00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:07.497
the Belgian Congo.
<v ->Yes.</v>

151
00:07:07.497 --> 00:07:10.910
<v Voiceover>Were they also looking at the physical effects</v>

152
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.669
of this substance on the human population at all?

153
00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:15.908
Did they conduct any experiments?

154
00:07:15.908 --> 00:07:18.610
Because they were doing other experiments at that time.

155
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.536
<v ->They began investigating</v>

156
00:07:21.536 --> 00:07:26.128
the radiobiological effects of ionizing radiation,

157
00:07:26.128 --> 00:07:28.789
even before 1900.
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

158
00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:32.223
<v ->And the early radiation pioneers,</v>

159
00:07:32.223 --> 00:07:34.376
such as Marie Curie,

160
00:07:34.376 --> 00:07:38.297
had horrific effects,

161
00:07:38.297 --> 00:07:39.557
health effects,

162
00:07:39.557 --> 00:07:42.666
from handling uranium.

163
00:07:42.666 --> 00:07:46.831
Now, she was interested in the daughter products,

164
00:07:46.831 --> 00:07:49.980
of the decay products, produced by uranium

165
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.930
when it decays.

166
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.693
And I actually have a photograph,

167
00:07:54.693 --> 00:07:59.311
or it's a drawing, of her hand, her right hand,

168
00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:03.619
the year before she died in 1933.

169
00:08:04.019 --> 00:08:07.655
And two of her fingers had already been amputated,

170
00:08:07.655 --> 00:08:10.114
because they were just full of cancer,

171
00:08:10.114 --> 00:08:13.141
and there are tumors all over her hand.

172
00:08:13.141 --> 00:08:15.681
And you can see where it was cut off

173
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:18.037
of her arm at the wrist.

174
00:08:18.037 --> 00:08:21.837
And nobody knows about

175
00:08:21.837 --> 00:08:23.279
these horrific effects.

176
00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:24.315
<v Voiceover>No, nobody teaches you</v>

177
00:08:24.315 --> 00:08:26.205
that part in school, do they?

178
00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:28.440
<v ->Oh, they never told us.</v>

179
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.207
That's the last thing they tell you,

180
00:08:30.207 --> 00:08:32.016
is the radiobiological effects,

181
00:08:32.016 --> 00:08:34.393
because they couldn't get anyone to make bombs,

182
00:08:34.393 --> 00:08:36.018
if they knew the truth.

183
00:08:36.018 --> 00:08:38.761
<v Voiceover>Well, let's go from where you were then,</v>

184
00:08:38.761 --> 00:08:42.519
where you were, this was still World War II era.

185
00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:43.434
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>And move it</v>

186
00:08:43.434 --> 00:08:44.307
forward.
<v ->Okay.</v>

187
00:08:44.307 --> 00:08:45.018
<v Voiceover>What happened from there?</v>

188
00:08:45.018 --> 00:08:45.973
And then I want to start getting into

189
00:08:45.973 --> 00:08:47.253
all of the physiological effects,

190
00:08:47.253 --> 00:08:49.976
how it moves around our planet, and so forth.

191
00:08:49.976 --> 00:08:52.515
<v ->During The Manhattan Project</v>

192
00:08:52.515 --> 00:08:55.847
atomic bombs were not the only weapon system

193
00:08:55.847 --> 00:08:57.676
that was developed, there were hundreds

194
00:08:57.676 --> 00:08:59.240
that were developed.

195
00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.080
And Dr. Vanifer Bush, unrelated to the Bush family,

196
00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.453
was in charge of the scientific effort

197
00:09:06.453 --> 00:09:09.602
for World War II for the Americans.

198
00:09:09.602 --> 00:09:12.142
And the Americans and the British were secret

199
00:09:12.142 --> 00:09:14.844
collaborators, as well.

200
00:09:14.844 --> 00:09:19.171
And actually, Fat Man, the bomb that was dropped

201
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:21.894
on Nagasaki, the plutonium bomb,

202
00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:25.876
was actually named for Winston Churchill.

203
00:09:25.876 --> 00:09:28.802
That's right, by General Groves.

204
00:09:28.802 --> 00:09:32.641
And-- I forgot what you asked me.

205
00:09:32.641 --> 00:09:33.779
<v Voiceover>Oh no, just to continue on</v>

206
00:09:33.779 --> 00:09:34.958
from World War II on.

207
00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:35.994
<v ->Oh yeah yeah yeah.</v>

208
00:09:35.994 --> 00:09:36.583
Okay.

209
00:09:36.583 --> 00:09:40.748
So the whole purpose of the weapon systems

210
00:09:40.748 --> 00:09:43.227
that were developed in World War II,

211
00:09:43.227 --> 00:09:46.010
was depopulation.

212
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.695
It was actually when

213
00:09:50.277 --> 00:09:52.898
the civilian population

214
00:09:52.898 --> 00:09:56.093
became the primary target of war.

215
00:09:56.839 --> 00:09:59.399
And the atomic bombs were developed

216
00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:01.370
for depopulation.

217
00:10:02.754 --> 00:10:05.535
But also, few people know that

218
00:10:05.535 --> 00:10:07.343
the prototype for Agent Orange was

219
00:10:07.343 --> 00:10:09.923
developed under The Manhattan Project.

220
00:10:09.923 --> 00:10:13.154
Or hormone that would defoliate

221
00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:15.531
all of the trees and vegetation

222
00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:17.623
and cause a country, or a population,

223
00:10:17.623 --> 00:10:19.106
to starve to death.

224
00:10:19.106 --> 00:10:22.154
And that of course, was taken off the shelf,

225
00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:25.161
dusted off, and used in Vietnam.

226
00:10:25.161 --> 00:10:28.452
And few people realize that the Vietnam War

227
00:10:28.452 --> 00:10:31.831
primarily was about depopulation.

228
00:10:32.495 --> 00:10:36.295
Now, why would depopulation be so important?

229
00:10:36.295 --> 00:10:39.139
It's to make it easier

230
00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:41.963
to steal the natural resources

231
00:10:41.963 --> 00:10:43.934
of another country

232
00:10:43.934 --> 00:10:46.108
that our country needs

233
00:10:46.108 --> 00:10:49.940
to maintain its higamony, and lifestyle,

234
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.236
and whatever else it is.

235
00:10:52.236 --> 00:10:54.979
And the third horrific weapon system

236
00:10:54.979 --> 00:10:57.092
developed in World War II

237
00:10:57.092 --> 00:11:01.602
by Dr. James Kanant, who developed radioactive,

238
00:11:01.602 --> 00:11:05.814
he developed poison gas in World War I.

239
00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:09.445
And few people know that the American University

240
00:11:09.445 --> 00:11:13.549
in Washington, DC, was taken over and turned into

241
00:11:13.549 --> 00:11:17.903
a poison gas factory for World War I.

242
00:11:18.323 --> 00:11:20.294
So he loved poison gas,

243
00:11:20.294 --> 00:11:23.321
he thought it was a more effective weapon

244
00:11:23.321 --> 00:11:25.334
and perfectly moral to use it,

245
00:11:25.334 --> 00:11:27.263
and develop it.

246
00:11:28.023 --> 00:11:29.660
I was really horrified,

247
00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.204
they took over 60 buildings

248
00:11:31.204 --> 00:11:32.870
at American University.

249
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.633
<v Voiceover>And also as an aside,</v>

250
00:11:35.633 --> 00:11:39.250
wasn't previous Democratic presidential

251
00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.667
candidate John Kerry's father

252
00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:43.212
involved in some of this?

253
00:11:43.212 --> 00:11:47.423
<v ->John Kerry's father brought</v>

254
00:11:48.717 --> 00:11:52.726
James Kanant into The Manhattan Project.

255
00:11:53.106 --> 00:11:54.101
<v Voiceover>CIA.</v>

256
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:57.007
<v ->And James Kanant developed</v>

257
00:11:57.007 --> 00:11:59.709
radioactive poison gas weapons

258
00:11:59.709 --> 00:12:01.802
with Compton, and Uri,

259
00:12:01.802 --> 00:12:04.930
who were also very good scientists.

260
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.190
<v Voiceover>Well it does help understand</v>

261
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:07.673
the depth of certain connections

262
00:12:07.673 --> 00:12:09.177
I wasn't aware of.
<v ->Yes.</v>

263
00:12:09.177 --> 00:12:11.086
<v Voiceover>Deep connections of John Kerry.</v>

264
00:12:11.086 --> 00:12:12.915
<v ->Deep, deep connections.</v>

265
00:12:12.915 --> 00:12:13.951
<v Voiceover>Yes, yes.</v>

266
00:12:13.951 --> 00:12:17.532
<v ->And, I mean,</v>

267
00:12:17.599 --> 00:12:21.854
it's just every war it's just recycled faces

268
00:12:21.854 --> 00:12:25.105
of the grandsons, and the great-grandsons,

269
00:12:25.105 --> 00:12:26.981
of all those.

270
00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.570
It's a global

271
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.106
criminal war crimes racketeering syndicate,

272
00:12:34.106 --> 00:12:37.295
and it's the same people generation after generation.

273
00:12:37.295 --> 00:12:39.063
<v Voiceover>Right, so here we go.</v>

274
00:12:39.063 --> 00:12:42.253
Now we have, we're in DC, poisonous gas.

275
00:12:42.253 --> 00:12:43.309
<v ->Right.
<v Voiceover>Now we're</v>

276
00:12:43.309 --> 00:12:44.386
finding much more efficient ways

277
00:12:44.386 --> 00:12:47.027
than grenades, and certainly bayonets of the past

278
00:12:47.027 --> 00:12:49.811
to start killing off populations with resources.

279
00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:50.887
<v ->That's right.</v>

280
00:12:50.887 --> 00:12:53.569
I'm going to read the words of Henry Kissinger

281
00:12:53.569 --> 00:12:56.353
in a national security memo,

282
00:12:56.353 --> 00:13:00.213
number 200, from April 14th,

283
00:13:00.213 --> 00:13:03.504
I'm sorry, April 24th, 1974.

284
00:13:03.504 --> 00:13:06.233
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>
<v ->It's very clear.</v>

285
00:13:06.694 --> 00:13:09.213
Dr. Henry Kissinger proposed

286
00:13:09.213 --> 00:13:11.083
in his memorandum

287
00:13:11.083 --> 00:13:14.604
to the National Security Council that quote,

288
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.559
Depopulation should be the highest priority

289
00:13:18.559 --> 00:13:22.263
of US Foreign Policy towards the third world.

290
00:13:22.562 --> 00:13:24.823
<v Voiceover>Wow.</v>
<v ->Unquote.</v>

291
00:13:24.857 --> 00:13:27.682
He quoted reasons of national security,

292
00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:31.014
and because the US economy will require

293
00:13:31.014 --> 00:13:35.260
large, and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad,

294
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.456
especially from less developed countries.

295
00:13:38.673 --> 00:13:41.619
Wherever a lessening of population

296
00:13:41.619 --> 00:13:45.932
can increase the prospects for such stability,

297
00:13:46.678 --> 00:13:50.091
population policy becomes relevant to resources,

298
00:13:50.091 --> 00:13:54.567
supplies, and to the economic interests of the US.

299
00:13:54.988 --> 00:13:56.877
This is from a paper that I'm

300
00:13:56.877 --> 00:13:58.691
I've written.

301
00:13:58.909 --> 00:14:00.453
And then it goes on,

302
00:14:00.453 --> 00:14:03.541
According to an NSC spokesman at the time,

303
00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:06.324
the United States shared the view of

304
00:14:06.324 --> 00:14:10.246
former world bank president Robert Macnamara,

305
00:14:10.246 --> 00:14:14.309
that the population crisis is a greater threat

306
00:14:14.309 --> 00:14:17.539
to US National Security interests,

307
00:14:17.539 --> 00:14:20.750
than nuclear annihilation.

308
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:22.070
<v Voiceover>Uhh.</v>

309
00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:23.513
<v ->In 1975--
<v Voiceover>And who's</v>

310
00:14:23.513 --> 00:14:24.671
playing God there?

311
00:14:24.671 --> 00:14:26.154
<v ->Who's playing God there?</v>

312
00:14:26.154 --> 00:14:29.669
In 1975, Henry Kissinger established

313
00:14:29.669 --> 00:14:33.474
a policy planning group in the US

314
00:14:33.474 --> 00:14:37.060
States Departments Office of Population Affairs.

315
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.646
And he, and General Haig,

316
00:14:41.067 --> 00:14:44.669
and Ed Muskie, and Brzezinski wrote,

317
00:14:44.947 --> 00:14:46.451
Global 2000--
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

318
00:14:46.451 --> 00:14:50.642
<v ->Which was the depopulation official policy</v>

319
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.161
of the US government.

320
00:14:53.298 --> 00:14:54.760
<v Voiceover>And you wrote,</v>

321
00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.772
you continued on that same vain.

322
00:14:56.772 --> 00:14:58.173
This is another article you've written,

323
00:14:58.173 --> 00:15:00.002
I actually just circled this.

324
00:15:00.002 --> 00:15:01.038
<v ->Uh huh.
<v Voiceover>A few hours ago</v>

325
00:15:01.038 --> 00:15:03.212
because, for the same reasons, what you just read here.

326
00:15:03.212 --> 00:15:03.883
<v ->Uh huh.
<v Voiceover>It says,</v>

327
00:15:03.883 --> 00:15:06.178
When I ask Vietnam Special Ops Green Beret

328
00:15:06.178 --> 00:15:07.824
Captain John McCarthy,

329
00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:11.359
Who could have devised this homicidal plan

330
00:15:11.359 --> 00:15:14.346
to use depleted uranium to destroy the genetic code,

331
00:15:14.346 --> 00:15:16.845
and genetic future of large populations

332
00:15:16.845 --> 00:15:19.852
of Arabs and Muslims in the Middle East,

333
00:15:19.852 --> 00:15:23.306
and Central Asia, just coincidentally the areas

334
00:15:23.306 --> 00:15:26.069
where most of the worlds oil deposits are located?

335
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:29.021
He replied, quote, It has all of the hand prints of

336
00:15:29.021 --> 00:15:30.782
"Henry Kissinger."
<v ->That's right.</v>

337
00:15:30.782 --> 00:15:31.703
<v Voiceover>End quote.</v>

338
00:15:31.703 --> 00:15:32.834
So he's, this is coming up everywhere,

339
00:15:32.834 --> 00:15:34.588
I've heard this before.
<v ->Yes.</v>

340
00:15:34.588 --> 00:15:36.573
<v Voiceover>Wow.</v>
<v ->But,</v>

341
00:15:36.573 --> 00:15:38.990
it goes farther than that.

342
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:42.654
Who does Henry Kissinger work for?

343
00:15:42.932 --> 00:15:45.654
Henry Kissinger, Brzezinski,

344
00:15:45.654 --> 00:15:49.169
Ford, Carter, and many others

345
00:15:49.169 --> 00:15:52.318
are all Rockefeller contracters.

346
00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:53.050
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->Even</v>

347
00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:56.524
Edward Teller had a Rockefeller fellowship

348
00:15:56.524 --> 00:15:58.373
when he left Hungary,

349
00:15:58.373 --> 00:16:02.050
and went to Niels Bohrs laboratory

350
00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.488
in Copenhagen to study

351
00:16:04.488 --> 00:16:06.479
before he came to the United States.

352
00:16:06.479 --> 00:16:08.653
<v Voiceover>So, the invisible hand,</v>

353
00:16:08.653 --> 00:16:11.091
typical, typical, one of the typical families,

354
00:16:11.091 --> 00:16:12.940
of course.
<v ->That's right.</v>

355
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:17.355
And the Rockefellers brought eugenics,

356
00:16:17.613 --> 00:16:21.987
or population control to the United States in the 20s.

357
00:16:22.022 --> 00:16:22.834
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->It came from</v>

358
00:16:22.834 --> 00:16:24.663
England.
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

359
00:16:24.663 --> 00:16:28.239
<v ->It was being bandied about</v>

360
00:16:28.239 --> 00:16:31.225
by (mumbling) in the 1700s.

361
00:16:31.225 --> 00:16:33.745
But there was no population crisis then.

362
00:16:33.745 --> 00:16:35.783
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->So</v>

363
00:16:36.122 --> 00:16:38.296
so what is the real purpose?

364
00:16:38.296 --> 00:16:39.860
It's to grab resources.

365
00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.363
<v Voiceover>Sure.</v>
<v ->And what is happening</v>

366
00:16:41.363 --> 00:16:44.147
now is that the new world order,

367
00:16:44.147 --> 00:16:46.361
these hidden interests.

368
00:16:46.361 --> 00:16:47.662
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->These very, very</v>

369
00:16:47.662 --> 00:16:49.592
powerful entities,

370
00:16:49.592 --> 00:16:53.188
are carving up the natural resources

371
00:16:53.188 --> 00:16:54.874
just like a turkey.

372
00:16:54.874 --> 00:16:56.520
All over the world.

373
00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.938
They're carving up California.

374
00:16:58.938 --> 00:17:02.758
The Rothschild's put Governor Schwarzenegger

375
00:17:02.758 --> 00:17:04.267
into office.

376
00:17:04.606 --> 00:17:08.263
And they are now getting hold of

377
00:17:08.263 --> 00:17:11.575
the vast water resources in California.

378
00:17:11.575 --> 00:17:13.403
California has no debt

379
00:17:13.403 --> 00:17:16.085
and it has a tremendous economy.

380
00:17:16.085 --> 00:17:17.833
It's bigger than most countries.

381
00:17:17.833 --> 00:17:18.422
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

382
00:17:18.422 --> 00:17:20.413
Years ago it was the sixth largest economy

383
00:17:20.413 --> 00:17:21.307
in the world.
<v ->That's right.</v>

384
00:17:21.307 --> 00:17:22.566
<v Voiceover>Eight years ago, and I don't know</v>

385
00:17:22.566 --> 00:17:24.232
where it is now.
<v ->And so now</v>

386
00:17:24.232 --> 00:17:28.601
they want to tangle and strangle California

387
00:17:28.951 --> 00:17:32.156
in big bank loans, and debt.

388
00:17:32.156 --> 00:17:34.452
Just like the CIA has done around the world

389
00:17:34.452 --> 00:17:36.179
to other countries.

390
00:17:36.179 --> 00:17:38.907
I just came back from Canada

391
00:17:39.084 --> 00:17:43.168
and some ranchers came all the way from Alberta

392
00:17:43.168 --> 00:17:46.033
to meet me at a conference in Vancouver.

393
00:17:46.033 --> 00:17:48.755
And I said, "Bring a map of Alberta

394
00:17:48.755 --> 00:17:50.116
"and we'll sit down and look at it.

395
00:17:50.116 --> 00:17:53.692
"I want to know where all the military installations are,

396
00:17:53.692 --> 00:17:56.597
"where all the mad cow disease is,

397
00:17:56.597 --> 00:18:00.484
"and where the chronic wasting disease is in wild game."

398
00:18:00.701 --> 00:18:04.399
Because I suspected radiation is present.

399
00:18:04.399 --> 00:18:05.577
And sure enough

400
00:18:05.577 --> 00:18:07.142
the chronic wasting disease

401
00:18:07.142 --> 00:18:08.706
and the mad cow disease

402
00:18:08.706 --> 00:18:10.697
are all downwind, and down current

403
00:18:10.697 --> 00:18:12.607
from military installations.

404
00:18:12.607 --> 00:18:14.192
Well think about it,

405
00:18:14.192 --> 00:18:17.158
the Canadian soldiers had to be trained

406
00:18:17.158 --> 00:18:19.271
in depleted uranium munitions

407
00:18:19.271 --> 00:18:21.384
before they were sent off to Iraq,

408
00:18:21.384 --> 00:18:25.068
and Afghanistan, and even Yugoslavia.

409
00:18:25.407 --> 00:18:27.012
As peace keepers.

410
00:18:27.012 --> 00:18:28.129
So--
<v Voiceover>Well at least</v>

411
00:18:28.129 --> 00:18:30.039
they educated them, that's more than

412
00:18:30.039 --> 00:18:32.599
happened to the US soldiers, isn't it?

413
00:18:32.599 --> 00:18:35.301
<v ->Well, the US soldiers,</v>

414
00:18:35.301 --> 00:18:37.502
they're just really all,

415
00:18:38.003 --> 00:18:40.773
they're just all disposable.

416
00:18:40.848 --> 00:18:42.697
Henry Kissinger said,

417
00:18:42.697 --> 00:18:44.444
after Vietnam,

418
00:18:44.444 --> 00:18:48.365
Military men are just dumb stupid animals

419
00:18:48.365 --> 00:18:52.536
to be used as pawns in foreign policy.

420
00:18:54.765 --> 00:18:55.903
<v Voiceover>Right, I read that.</v>

421
00:18:55.903 --> 00:18:59.150
<v ->And we're just all part of the national sacrifice then.</v>

422
00:18:59.509 --> 00:19:02.200
So what happened,

423
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:06.036
in about 1968

424
00:19:06.416 --> 00:19:08.712
we found the first patent on

425
00:19:08.712 --> 00:19:11.212
depleted uranium weapon systems.

426
00:19:11.212 --> 00:19:14.624
And that was a gattling gun on ships

427
00:19:14.624 --> 00:19:18.409
that would shoot depleted uranium for the Navy.

428
00:19:19.481 --> 00:19:22.447
In 1973,

429
00:19:22.447 --> 00:19:25.229
the United States government

430
00:19:25.229 --> 00:19:28.014
gave Israel depleted uranium weapons

431
00:19:28.014 --> 00:19:30.451
to use in the Yom Kippur War

432
00:19:30.451 --> 00:19:33.844
and they just annihilated and wiped out

433
00:19:33.844 --> 00:19:35.937
the Egyptian and Arab tanks.

434
00:19:35.937 --> 00:19:40.047
But they also contaminated the Golan Heights.

435
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.743
And many women in Berkeley

436
00:19:42.743 --> 00:19:45.282
have come to ask me

437
00:19:45.282 --> 00:19:49.312
why their families are in an epidemic of breast cancer.

438
00:19:49.508 --> 00:19:51.378
The women of the family.

439
00:19:51.378 --> 00:19:54.283
And they said they lived on kibbutzes in Israel,

440
00:19:54.283 --> 00:19:56.416
and I said, "Well this is why."

441
00:19:56.416 --> 00:20:01.340
In 1974, Hughes Aircrafts, one of their subsidiaries

442
00:20:01.719 --> 00:20:04.624
developed the filleting system,

443
00:20:04.624 --> 00:20:06.006
which is still used.

444
00:20:06.006 --> 00:20:09.358
It's one of the most effective

445
00:20:09.358 --> 00:20:12.670
gattling gun type defense

446
00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.839
weaponry used on ships, Navy ships,

447
00:20:15.839 --> 00:20:17.506
that shoots depleted uranium

448
00:20:17.506 --> 00:20:20.187
about 3000 bullets a minute.

449
00:20:20.187 --> 00:20:22.605
Four tons, the Wart Hog,

450
00:20:22.605 --> 00:20:25.449
which is the Air Force main delivery system

451
00:20:25.449 --> 00:20:27.197
for depleted uranium,

452
00:20:27.197 --> 00:20:30.697
shoots three tons a minute.

453
00:20:30.697 --> 00:20:32.540
<v Voiceover>Hmm.</v>
<v ->Three tons a minute.</v>

454
00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.699
<v Voiceover>Amazing.</v>

455
00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:35.141
<v ->It is amazing.
<v Voiceover>Amazing.</v>

456
00:20:35.141 --> 00:20:36.198
Shocking.
<v ->And 800 tons</v>

457
00:20:36.198 --> 00:20:39.301
of depleted uranium is the ,

458
00:20:39.301 --> 00:20:41.191
(mumbling) equivalent

459
00:20:41.191 --> 00:20:43.528
the equivalent number of radioactive atoms

460
00:20:43.528 --> 00:20:45.722
released into the atmosphere,

461
00:20:45.722 --> 00:20:49.548
of 83,000 Nagasaki bombs.

462
00:20:50.578 --> 00:20:53.401
It's all radioactive poison gas.

463
00:20:53.401 --> 00:20:56.754
My scientific research and expertise

464
00:20:56.754 --> 00:20:58.602
is in atmospheric dust.

465
00:20:58.602 --> 00:21:00.310
I'm a geoscientist.

466
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.424
And so I know that

467
00:21:03.769 --> 00:21:07.203
that dust is carried around the world,

468
00:21:07.203 --> 00:21:10.006
the atomize depleted uranium

469
00:21:10.006 --> 00:21:11.511
high temperature oxides

470
00:21:11.511 --> 00:21:12.953
are carried around the world

471
00:21:12.953 --> 00:21:14.965
in two or three weeks.

472
00:21:14.965 --> 00:21:16.304
<v Voiceover>Right, and then okay.</v>

473
00:21:16.304 --> 00:21:18.114
So now let's take it,

474
00:21:18.114 --> 00:21:19.475
let's go ahead and forward it a little bit

475
00:21:19.475 --> 00:21:22.015
to the Persian Gulf War.

476
00:21:22.015 --> 00:21:23.598
We have the Gulf War.
<v ->Okay.</v>

477
00:21:23.598 --> 00:21:25.915
<v Voiceover>And then we'll move it up to Iraq.</v>

478
00:21:25.915 --> 00:21:26.748
<v ->Okay.
<v Voiceover>And then I</v>

479
00:21:26.748 --> 00:21:28.413
want to get into the symtomology.

480
00:21:28.413 --> 00:21:29.450
<v ->Okay.
<v Voiceover>And what has</v>

481
00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:30.608
happened to the people of this planet

482
00:21:30.608 --> 00:21:32.517
since this all began.

483
00:21:34.007 --> 00:21:38.335
<v ->The, of course, when you make a weapon system</v>

484
00:21:38.553 --> 00:21:40.563
it has to be fully tested,

485
00:21:40.563 --> 00:21:42.798
and soldiers have to be trained

486
00:21:42.798 --> 00:21:45.405
in everything in it.

487
00:21:45.723 --> 00:21:49.305
The storage, manufacturer, testing

488
00:21:49.888 --> 00:21:52.429
has contaminated 39 states

489
00:21:52.429 --> 00:21:54.358
in the United States.

490
00:21:54.358 --> 00:21:56.959
So, all through the 70s and 80s

491
00:21:56.959 --> 00:21:58.849
depleted uranium weapon systems

492
00:21:58.849 --> 00:22:01.408
had to be tested with the result

493
00:22:01.408 --> 00:22:05.026
that 39 states in the US, that I know of,

494
00:22:05.026 --> 00:22:08.296
were contaimined on the gunnery ranges

495
00:22:08.296 --> 00:22:11.075
and bombing ranges.

496
00:22:11.075 --> 00:22:15.575
And that's a very interesting story because now

497
00:22:16.077 --> 00:22:18.149
those are being sold for a dollar

498
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:20.934
to land developers, who want to build houses

499
00:22:20.934 --> 00:22:24.860
on these radioactive contaminated sites.

500
00:22:24.996 --> 00:22:26.337
<v Voiceover>Jeez, you're kidding.</v>

501
00:22:26.337 --> 00:22:27.903
<v ->No, I'm not kidding.</v>

502
00:22:27.903 --> 00:22:31.321
And, now.

503
00:22:32.514 --> 00:22:34.647
<v Voiceover>So then we get into war applications.</v>

504
00:22:34.647 --> 00:22:35.561
<v ->That's right.</v>

505
00:22:35.561 --> 00:22:39.504
But who was the prime pusher

506
00:22:39.504 --> 00:22:44.243
and benefactor of depleted uranium weaponry?

507
00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.329
It was The Carliyle Group.

508
00:22:46.329 --> 00:22:49.986
They made their first really big pile of money

509
00:22:49.986 --> 00:22:52.811
off of depleted uranium weapon systems.

510
00:22:52.811 --> 00:22:53.460
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

511
00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:54.557
That explains a few things.

512
00:22:54.557 --> 00:22:55.878
<v ->That explains a lot.</v>

513
00:22:55.878 --> 00:22:56.650
Right.

514
00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.987
And of course George Herbert Walker Bush

515
00:22:58.987 --> 00:23:02.684
was a president when the first Gulf War happened.

516
00:23:02.684 --> 00:23:05.549
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->And so.</v>

517
00:23:05.549 --> 00:23:07.419
<v Voiceover>Intimately involved with the Carliyle Group.</v>

518
00:23:07.419 --> 00:23:08.881
<v ->Very intimately involved.</v>

519
00:23:08.881 --> 00:23:10.953
So after the war

520
00:23:10.953 --> 00:23:14.346
there were very, very strange illnesses

521
00:23:14.346 --> 00:23:16.704
in our soldiers, and it came to be known

522
00:23:16.704 --> 00:23:19.000
as Gulf War Syndrome.

523
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.352
It was sort of a web of ill-defined illnesses

524
00:23:22.352 --> 00:23:24.870
and it was different in different people

525
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.903
and changed over time.

526
00:23:26.903 --> 00:23:29.218
And it was really a puzzle.

527
00:23:29.218 --> 00:23:33.525
Of course there were entities in the government,

528
00:23:33.525 --> 00:23:36.167
and the Department of Energy,

529
00:23:36.167 --> 00:23:37.975
and the shadow government

530
00:23:37.975 --> 00:23:41.653
who were fully aware of what this was

531
00:23:41.653 --> 00:23:44.354
causing The Gulf War Syndrome.

532
00:23:44.354 --> 00:23:46.752
And it's quite obvious now

533
00:23:46.752 --> 00:23:48.418
that it was introduced

534
00:23:48.418 --> 00:23:51.689
to the mineral rich, oil rich areas

535
00:23:51.689 --> 00:23:54.067
of the Middle East, and Central Asia,

536
00:23:54.067 --> 00:23:57.135
in order to destroy the genetic future

537
00:23:57.135 --> 00:23:59.247
of people living in those regions,

538
00:23:59.247 --> 00:24:01.442
and to depopulate those regions

539
00:24:01.442 --> 00:24:04.977
in order to be able to secure

540
00:24:04.977 --> 00:24:07.861
the mineral resources that were essential

541
00:24:07.861 --> 00:24:11.803
to its actually Zionist Anglo American,

542
00:24:14.033 --> 00:24:15.602
the economic empire.

543
00:24:15.602 --> 00:24:17.390
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->And this is</v>

544
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:18.793
an old, old theme.

545
00:24:18.793 --> 00:24:20.973
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->So.</v>

546
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.648
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about the numbers.</v>

547
00:24:23.648 --> 00:24:24.360
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>Because</v>

548
00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.026
just going back to the '91 now.

549
00:24:26.026 --> 00:24:26.980
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>I didn't know</v>

550
00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:27.853
if I had read it correctly,

551
00:24:27.853 --> 00:24:29.336
I've read articles through the years,

552
00:24:29.336 --> 00:24:32.459
but of the people, there are 580,000

553
00:24:32.459 --> 00:24:34.111
American troops that served over there,

554
00:24:34.111 --> 00:24:35.533
that's about right?
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

555
00:24:35.533 --> 00:24:36.427
<v Voiceover>And about a half a million</v>

556
00:24:36.427 --> 00:24:38.480
are on disability of some kind or another?

557
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.202
<v ->55%.
<v Voiceover>Oh, 55%.</v>

558
00:24:41.202 --> 00:24:42.095
That's--
<v ->It's over.</v>

559
00:24:42.095 --> 00:24:43.497
<v Voiceover>That's massive.</v>
<v ->It's massive.</v>

560
00:24:43.497 --> 00:24:45.001
<v Voiceover>55%.</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

561
00:24:45.001 --> 00:24:46.626
<v Voiceover>And let's start talking about what happens</v>

562
00:24:46.626 --> 00:24:49.390
when they came home after they've been exposed,

563
00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.096
what starts happening to the genetic structure

564
00:24:51.096 --> 00:24:52.397
of their families?

565
00:24:52.397 --> 00:24:55.728
Not just the people that they were warring with.

566
00:24:55.728 --> 00:24:59.691
<v ->There's an excellent photo essay</v>

567
00:25:00.391 --> 00:25:03.469
in Life magazine from about 1995

568
00:25:03.469 --> 00:25:04.810
it's on the Internet,

569
00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:08.040
and it's called "The Tiny Victims of Desert Storm.

570
00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.824
And it's the story in photos

571
00:25:10.824 --> 00:25:13.038
of these soldiers coming back

572
00:25:13.038 --> 00:25:16.330
after they've been exposed to their children

573
00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:19.844
the pre-war babies who were normal children,

574
00:25:19.844 --> 00:25:23.198
and the babies that they fathered

575
00:25:23.198 --> 00:25:26.840
after being exposed to depleted uranium.

576
00:25:26.894 --> 00:25:29.231
Even over a short period of time,

577
00:25:29.231 --> 00:25:32.014
in Iraq, and Kuwait,

578
00:25:32.014 --> 00:25:34.859
these poor babies look like Iraqi babies.

579
00:25:34.859 --> 00:25:38.380
They're children born without eyes,

580
00:25:38.617 --> 00:25:41.360
and opthalmia, which is a very, very rare

581
00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.128
birth defect.

582
00:25:43.128 --> 00:25:48.031
And it occurs about one in 40,000 cases.

583
00:25:48.816 --> 00:25:51.112
There's an epidemic of it.

584
00:25:51.112 --> 00:25:53.874
There are children born without limbs.

585
00:25:53.874 --> 00:25:56.150
Without brains.

586
00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:59.380
They have horrible disfigurement

587
00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:02.185
and discoloring on their skin.

588
00:26:02.185 --> 00:26:04.013
They have all kinds of health problems

589
00:26:04.013 --> 00:26:06.248
the rest of their lives.

590
00:26:06.248 --> 00:26:07.629
It's horrendous.

591
00:26:07.629 --> 00:26:10.770
And not only were the soldiers sick,

592
00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:13.898
but they internally contaminated their wives,

593
00:26:13.898 --> 00:26:16.397
that the families are dying together.

594
00:26:16.397 --> 00:26:19.384
And they were just tossed to the curb,

595
00:26:19.384 --> 00:26:20.481
kicked to the curb,

596
00:26:20.481 --> 00:26:22.817
by The Veteran's Administration in the military.

597
00:26:22.817 --> 00:26:23.772
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

598
00:26:23.772 --> 00:26:28.289
<v ->And about, in about 2005,</v>

599
00:26:28.995 --> 00:26:31.208
I started going to state legislatures

600
00:26:31.208 --> 00:26:34.520
to get state depleted uranium bills passed,

601
00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:38.360
because it's been a cover up in Washington, DC,

602
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.940
under three presidential administrations.

603
00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:44.618
And the Pentagon, congress was complicit in the cover up.

604
00:26:44.618 --> 00:26:48.844
And I said, Well maybe if I push from the bottom up

605
00:26:48.844 --> 00:26:51.019
from the state legislatures,

606
00:26:51.019 --> 00:26:54.722
we can get some movement in Washington, DC.

607
00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.648
Well, there are over 33

608
00:26:57.648 --> 00:26:59.247
depleted uranium bills

609
00:26:59.247 --> 00:27:01.440
introduced in state legislatures.

610
00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.778
And the way I convinced legislatures,

611
00:27:03.778 --> 00:27:06.988
especially in Hawaii, to support these bills,

612
00:27:06.988 --> 00:27:10.421
is, I said, "After World War II

613
00:27:10.421 --> 00:27:14.450
"the medical disability rate in our soldiers was 5%.

614
00:27:14.687 --> 00:27:18.121
"After Vietnam, because of Agent Orange, it was 10%.

615
00:27:18.121 --> 00:27:20.802
"Today it's over 55%

616
00:27:20.802 --> 00:27:24.154
"and these soldiers are being dumped on state

617
00:27:24.154 --> 00:27:26.228
"and county medical facilities

618
00:27:26.228 --> 00:27:29.499
"and it's going to bankrupt your government."

619
00:27:29.499 --> 00:27:31.692
And that's when they sat up

620
00:27:31.692 --> 00:27:34.476
and there was very, very strong support,

621
00:27:34.476 --> 00:27:37.077
even from Republicans,

622
00:27:37.077 --> 00:27:40.936
even from Generals who are members of the legislatures

623
00:27:40.936 --> 00:27:42.785
around the United States.

624
00:27:42.785 --> 00:27:45.135
And the states have been passing the bills

625
00:27:45.135 --> 00:27:46.618
very successfully.

626
00:27:46.618 --> 00:27:48.507
<v Voiceover>And this cover up extends into</v>

627
00:27:48.507 --> 00:27:51.972
a lot of areas, even the doctors who have diagnosed

628
00:27:51.972 --> 00:27:54.825
their patients, who are the people you are talking about.

629
00:27:54.825 --> 00:27:56.939
The returning soldiers aren't allowed to talk about it

630
00:27:56.939 --> 00:27:59.011
under the threat of fines, and worse.

631
00:27:59.011 --> 00:28:03.344
<v ->The doctors, before the 2003 Iraq war,</v>

632
00:28:03.602 --> 00:28:06.486
were trained by the military, over a year

633
00:28:06.486 --> 00:28:10.760
before that war started in March of 2003.

634
00:28:11.484 --> 00:28:14.918
And the doctors were threatened

635
00:28:14.918 --> 00:28:17.966
with $10,000 fines

636
00:28:17.966 --> 00:28:21.033
to $250,000 fines,

637
00:28:21.033 --> 00:28:23.431
and one to 10 years in prison

638
00:28:23.431 --> 00:28:26.173
if they said anything at all

639
00:28:26.173 --> 00:28:29.405
about the condition of the soldiers.

640
00:28:29.405 --> 00:28:32.269
And they were only allowed to diagnose

641
00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:35.404
Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome.

642
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.474
<v Voiceover>Which is interesting,</v>

643
00:28:36.474 --> 00:28:39.218
because so many people who consider themselves

644
00:28:39.218 --> 00:28:41.859
well-informed, watch Fox TV at night, and so forth.

645
00:28:41.859 --> 00:28:43.444
<v ->Right.
<v Voiceover>Will say,</v>

646
00:28:43.444 --> 00:28:45.353
Well, if this was true, why haven't I heard about it?

647
00:28:45.353 --> 00:28:48.258
But it's really hard, I think, for most people

648
00:28:48.258 --> 00:28:49.599
to get their minds around the fact

649
00:28:49.599 --> 00:28:51.692
that this is really insidious.

650
00:28:51.692 --> 00:28:53.601
<v ->It's, and, and</v>

651
00:28:53.601 --> 00:28:55.430
it was under President Clinton.

652
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.360
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->The HIPAA bill</v>

653
00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.514
was used to threaten the doctors

654
00:28:59.514 --> 00:29:02.216
and medical care people.

655
00:29:02.216 --> 00:29:06.584
And then the planes were flying in at night to,

656
00:29:07.824 --> 00:29:10.221
what's the big hospital.

657
00:29:10.221 --> 00:29:11.981
<v Voiceover>Walter Reed?</v>
<v ->Walter Reed.</v>

658
00:29:11.981 --> 00:29:14.812
And the journalists were not allowed

659
00:29:14.812 --> 00:29:16.844
anywhere near the planes,

660
00:29:16.844 --> 00:29:18.002
they weren't allowed to see

661
00:29:18.002 --> 00:29:19.587
any of the sick soldiers

662
00:29:19.587 --> 00:29:23.961
being unloaded and transported to Walter Reed.

663
00:29:24.321 --> 00:29:28.289
And now they're closing the military hospitals.

664
00:29:28.648 --> 00:29:30.274
<v Voiceover>Oh boy, who's going to help them?</v>

665
00:29:30.274 --> 00:29:31.736
<v ->They want to close Walter Reed.</v>

666
00:29:31.736 --> 00:29:34.379
Well, it's dumping all the medical care

667
00:29:34.379 --> 00:29:36.287
onto the States.
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

668
00:29:36.287 --> 00:29:38.035
And this is from another,

669
00:29:38.035 --> 00:29:39.660
a document that you wrote here,

670
00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:40.920
I just wanted to read this too.

671
00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.505
You were talking to a group of about

672
00:29:42.505 --> 00:29:45.471
251 soldiers from a study group in Mississippi

673
00:29:45.471 --> 00:29:47.137
who had all had normal babies

674
00:29:47.137 --> 00:29:48.599
before the Gulf War.

675
00:29:48.599 --> 00:29:51.606
67, it's amazing, 67%

676
00:29:51.606 --> 00:29:53.211
of their post-war babies

677
00:29:53.211 --> 00:29:54.857
were born with severe birth defects.

678
00:29:54.857 --> 00:29:55.792
<v ->That's right.
<v Voiceover>Now, if that</v>

679
00:29:55.792 --> 00:29:57.275
isn't a huge wake up call.

680
00:29:57.275 --> 00:29:58.880
<v ->And that was reported first</v>

681
00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:02.334
by Laura Flanders in an article

682
00:30:02.334 --> 00:30:05.463
she wrote for the nation called (foreign language)

683
00:30:05.463 --> 00:30:06.986
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->And then I</v>

684
00:30:06.986 --> 00:30:09.404
looked in testimony in congress

685
00:30:09.404 --> 00:30:12.269
and that was reported in congress during hearings.

686
00:30:12.269 --> 00:30:13.610
<v Voiceover>So we can see what's happening</v>

687
00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.194
when they're directly exposed to it.

688
00:30:15.194 --> 00:30:16.860
By the way, they're not being informed that

689
00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:18.242
they're being directly exposed

690
00:30:18.242 --> 00:30:21.371
although you did say, I read somewhere you

691
00:30:21.371 --> 00:30:23.971
had stated that in Israel

692
00:30:23.971 --> 00:30:25.841
before going into Lebanon

693
00:30:25.841 --> 00:30:27.588
the Israeli soldiers were actually told

694
00:30:27.588 --> 00:30:29.620
to leave their sperm at a sperm bank

695
00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.001
if they wanted to reproduce

696
00:30:31.001 --> 00:30:32.626
after this event was over.

697
00:30:32.626 --> 00:30:34.369
<v ->That was in,</v>

698
00:30:34.369 --> 00:30:36.649
before the July 2006.

699
00:30:36.649 --> 00:30:38.722
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->Israeli attack</v>

700
00:30:38.722 --> 00:30:39.839
on Lebanon.

701
00:30:39.839 --> 00:30:41.911
Now, what's even worse,

702
00:30:41.911 --> 00:30:44.756
is Dr. Chris Busby in England,

703
00:30:44.756 --> 00:30:47.173
he's the British Government and European Parliament

704
00:30:47.173 --> 00:30:49.246
low level radiation expert,

705
00:30:49.246 --> 00:30:52.090
was able to get samples

706
00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:54.142
from some of the bomb craters

707
00:30:54.142 --> 00:30:57.027
close to Israel, in Lebanon

708
00:30:57.027 --> 00:30:58.592
along that border.

709
00:30:58.592 --> 00:31:02.661
And he had the samples analyzed

710
00:31:02.757 --> 00:31:05.174
at Harwell, which is the British Government

711
00:31:05.174 --> 00:31:08.269
Laboratory for Radiation.

712
00:31:08.689 --> 00:31:12.672
And he said, "Leuren, they found

713
00:31:12.672 --> 00:31:16.309
"deuterium in the bomb craters.

714
00:31:16.309 --> 00:31:19.620
"And very high levels of uranium 235."

715
00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.789
That was not the correct signature

716
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:26.324
for a depleted uranium bunker buster bomb.

717
00:31:26.324 --> 00:31:29.026
And he said there were also very high radiation

718
00:31:29.026 --> 00:31:31.729
reported by the scientists monitoring

719
00:31:31.729 --> 00:31:34.411
the bunker buster craters.

720
00:31:34.411 --> 00:31:37.031
And the radiation fell off very fast,

721
00:31:37.031 --> 00:31:39.064
within three weeks.

722
00:31:39.064 --> 00:31:41.807
And I said, "A-ha, they're using

723
00:31:41.807 --> 00:31:44.996
"fourth generation nuclear weapons now."

724
00:31:44.996 --> 00:31:47.109
And what they want is to

725
00:31:47.109 --> 00:31:50.543
use radiation pollution to expose

726
00:31:50.543 --> 00:31:52.594
the civilian population.

727
00:31:52.594 --> 00:31:54.280
And then to have the radiation

728
00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.536
disappear very quickly,

729
00:31:56.536 --> 00:31:59.319
and you can do that with neutron activation.

730
00:31:59.319 --> 00:32:02.285
That's basically what was in those bombs.

731
00:32:02.285 --> 00:32:04.216
<v Voiceover>But I mean, they used them on</v>

732
00:32:04.216 --> 00:32:07.283
the Lebanese, but that same toxicity

733
00:32:07.283 --> 00:32:09.478
was floating right back into Israel, wasn't it?

734
00:32:09.478 --> 00:32:12.059
<v ->Oh, it went straight to Israel within an hour.</v>

735
00:32:12.059 --> 00:32:14.455
And so I sent out a press release

736
00:32:14.455 --> 00:32:17.057
all over the world, and I said,

737
00:32:17.057 --> 00:32:19.270
"Israel just nuked itself,

738
00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:22.034
"and we're going to see very large increases

739
00:32:22.034 --> 00:32:24.716
"in diabetes within six months."

740
00:32:24.716 --> 00:32:26.707
As soon as it starts raining,

741
00:32:26.707 --> 00:32:29.653
the rain washes the radioactive particles

742
00:32:29.653 --> 00:32:32.640
out of the air, onto peoples skin,

743
00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.286
into the drinking water,

744
00:32:34.286 --> 00:32:36.926
onto the food, they're inhaling it.

745
00:32:36.926 --> 00:32:39.486
And sure enough,

746
00:32:39.486 --> 00:32:42.127
the rains start in Israel,

747
00:32:42.127 --> 00:32:44.748
it has a Mediterranean climate like California,

748
00:32:44.748 --> 00:32:46.536
the rain started in October,

749
00:32:46.536 --> 00:32:49.563
by December there were reports in newspapers

750
00:32:49.563 --> 00:32:53.931
in Israel, of very high

751
00:32:54.891 --> 00:32:58.665
new diagnoses of diabetes of children

752
00:32:58.665 --> 00:32:59.865
in northern Israel.

753
00:32:59.865 --> 00:33:01.489
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->So I got</v>

754
00:33:01.489 --> 00:33:04.720
a rain fall map out, and sure enough,

755
00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.341
northern Israel has the highest rainfall

756
00:33:07.341 --> 00:33:11.308
of all of Israel because of all the mountainous terrain.

757
00:33:11.485 --> 00:33:15.061
And there isn't,

758
00:33:15.061 --> 00:33:19.124
I don't know any leadership that is loyal to the citizens.

759
00:33:19.124 --> 00:33:23.167
The citizens are just part of the national sacrifice then.

760
00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:24.407
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

761
00:33:24.407 --> 00:33:27.698
But now let's look at the sacrifice on a larger scale.

762
00:33:27.698 --> 00:33:30.624
We think, okay, we're sitting comfortably

763
00:33:30.624 --> 00:33:32.330
in a little urban park

764
00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:33.874
with all the partying going on,

765
00:33:33.874 --> 00:33:35.642
it must be a football game on today.

766
00:33:35.642 --> 00:33:36.658
<v ->Right.
<v Voiceover>Around us</v>

767
00:33:36.658 --> 00:33:37.592
and so forth.

768
00:33:37.592 --> 00:33:39.482
Everybody's comfortable in their little garden.

769
00:33:39.482 --> 00:33:40.782
But the reality is

770
00:33:40.782 --> 00:33:42.184
uranium doesn't stay put,

771
00:33:42.184 --> 00:33:44.724
depleted uranium and radiation doesn't stay put.

772
00:33:44.724 --> 00:33:48.056
Can you talk about the nature of how it spreads,

773
00:33:48.056 --> 00:33:50.494
how far it spreads, the way in which it works its way in,

774
00:33:50.494 --> 00:33:53.358
and the fact that the WHO has indicated

775
00:33:53.358 --> 00:33:56.468
they're expecting a massive rise in cancer rates,

776
00:33:56.468 --> 00:33:58.681
what is it, 50% by 2020?

777
00:33:58.681 --> 00:34:03.056
<v ->And diabetes from 32 million to 230 million.</v>

778
00:34:03.334 --> 00:34:04.167
<v Voiceover>My gosh.</v>
<v ->That's almost</v>

779
00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:05.956
10 times.
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

780
00:34:05.956 --> 00:34:07.297
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>So how</v>

781
00:34:07.297 --> 00:34:08.454
how does this travel?

782
00:34:08.454 --> 00:34:10.405
How does it get into,

783
00:34:10.405 --> 00:34:13.331
it's not in our own backyards scenario anymore,

784
00:34:13.331 --> 00:34:15.038
it's in everybody's backyard.

785
00:34:15.038 --> 00:34:16.357
Can you tell us how this happened?

786
00:34:16.357 --> 00:34:19.182
<v ->It's in every cubic meter of air, my dear.</v>

787
00:34:19.182 --> 00:34:20.260
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
(laughs)

788
00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:20.969
That's right.

789
00:34:20.969 --> 00:34:21.802
So can you tell us what

790
00:34:21.802 --> 00:34:25.459
how it gets there, and what this means?

791
00:34:25.459 --> 00:34:29.097
<v ->When depleted uranium burns,</v>

792
00:34:29.097 --> 00:34:31.169
uranium is a metal that burns.

793
00:34:31.169 --> 00:34:35.659
It catches on fire at about 190 degree centigrade.

794
00:34:36.166 --> 00:34:39.649
And it reaches extremely high temperatures,

795
00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:42.251
over 5000 degrees centigrade.

796
00:34:42.251 --> 00:34:45.264
It gets hotter than the sun.

797
00:34:46.191 --> 00:34:48.000
When the sun is burning.

798
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.377
And it forms a vapor,

799
00:34:50.377 --> 00:34:52.693
it completely vaporizes the metals

800
00:34:52.693 --> 00:34:55.293
into atom sized particles.

801
00:34:55.293 --> 00:34:57.589
And as they cool,

802
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:59.682
they condense, or quench,

803
00:34:59.682 --> 00:35:03.739
into these round hollow Christmas tree balls

804
00:35:03.896 --> 00:35:07.370
of depleted uranium high temperature oxides.

805
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:08.832
They're completely insoluble.

806
00:35:08.832 --> 00:35:11.108
They're almost completely insoluble.

807
00:35:11.108 --> 00:35:15.746
And they become incorporated in air masses

808
00:35:16.085 --> 00:35:20.744
and air movements, and just storms and hurricanes.

809
00:35:23.482 --> 00:35:26.528
They become incorporated into the atmospheric dust

810
00:35:26.528 --> 00:35:28.784
that travels all over the world.

811
00:35:28.784 --> 00:35:33.056
And we know from air monitoring done

812
00:35:33.538 --> 00:35:37.682
at Aldermaston, which is the atomic weapons facility

813
00:35:37.682 --> 00:35:40.933
in England, that it only took

814
00:35:40.933 --> 00:35:42.885
it only takes seven to nine days

815
00:35:42.885 --> 00:35:46.094
for the uranium to travel from Afghanistan,

816
00:35:46.094 --> 00:35:50.082
from Iraq, from Yugoslavia, to England.

817
00:35:50.562 --> 00:35:54.834
And they were measuring such high concentrations

818
00:35:55.316 --> 00:35:59.569
in England, during the 2003 Iraq on Baghdad,

819
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:04.481
that, and during the attack

820
00:36:04.481 --> 00:36:06.328
on Afghanistan in 2001.

821
00:36:06.328 --> 00:36:08.583
That that facility was required

822
00:36:08.583 --> 00:36:10.452
to notify the British Government

823
00:36:10.452 --> 00:36:14.359
because the concentrations were so alarmingly high.

824
00:36:15.329 --> 00:36:16.669
<v Voiceover>So in effect, yes.</v>

825
00:36:16.669 --> 00:36:19.676
<v ->And Dr. Busby calculated that a man living</v>

826
00:36:19.676 --> 00:36:23.624
within 100 miles of the Aldermaston facility,

827
00:36:24.064 --> 00:36:26.259
air monitoring facility,

828
00:36:26.259 --> 00:36:29.652
would inhale 23 million particles

829
00:36:29.652 --> 00:36:32.536
of depleted uranium in two weeks.

830
00:36:33.766 --> 00:36:37.088
Cancer can start with a

831
00:36:37.088 --> 00:36:39.465
single alpha particle.

832
00:36:39.465 --> 00:36:41.862
From one uranium atom.

833
00:36:41.862 --> 00:36:44.178
Under the right conditions.

834
00:36:44.178 --> 00:36:47.856
This is a global, silent,

835
00:36:47.856 --> 00:36:51.722
invisible, tasteless death.

836
00:36:52.571 --> 00:36:56.776
And it is going to cause increases in

837
00:36:56.776 --> 00:37:00.433
death rates and decreases in birth rates.

838
00:37:00.433 --> 00:37:02.871
Because one of the first symptoms

839
00:37:02.871 --> 00:37:07.082
of radiation poisoning is infertility.

840
00:37:07.482 --> 00:37:10.652
<v Voiceover>Exactly, and countries all around the world</v>

841
00:37:10.652 --> 00:37:11.892
are experiencing it.

842
00:37:11.892 --> 00:37:12.805
<v ->Are struggling.
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

843
00:37:12.805 --> 00:37:14.064
<v ->Struggling with infertility.</v>

844
00:37:14.064 --> 00:37:17.093
It also, the canary in the coalmine,

845
00:37:17.093 --> 00:37:20.404
is our babies, low birth weight babies,

846
00:37:20.404 --> 00:37:22.699
low birth weight in babies is going up

847
00:37:22.699 --> 00:37:24.535
exponentially.

848
00:37:25.523 --> 00:37:29.425
And if you look at the vital statistics

849
00:37:29.425 --> 00:37:31.030
of countries like I have.

850
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:32.736
I've gone to governments around the world

851
00:37:32.736 --> 00:37:35.967
and collected the vital statistics on health,

852
00:37:35.967 --> 00:37:38.729
and increases in disease, and mortality,

853
00:37:38.729 --> 00:37:41.045
and decreases in birth.

854
00:37:41.045 --> 00:37:45.196
It's very obvious that the Global 2000 policy

855
00:37:45.759 --> 00:37:48.156
is absolutely underway, it's done.

856
00:37:48.156 --> 00:37:48.787
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->They've</v>

857
00:37:48.787 --> 00:37:51.610
contaminated the entire atmosphere,

858
00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:54.624
and biosphere of this planet.

859
00:37:54.923 --> 00:37:58.565
And that's why I call it the Queen's Death Star.

860
00:37:58.762 --> 00:38:00.590
The Queen of England owns

861
00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:04.461
all of the uranium in Canada, in Australia.

862
00:38:04.461 --> 00:38:06.269
She owns all the mineral rights

863
00:38:06.269 --> 00:38:09.032
to those two vast regions.

864
00:38:09.032 --> 00:38:12.831
And 30% of the uranium produced globally

865
00:38:12.831 --> 00:38:16.082
every year is from Canada.

866
00:38:16.082 --> 00:38:19.048
But the Canadians have a law,

867
00:38:19.048 --> 00:38:21.608
the Canadian uranium cannot be used

868
00:38:21.608 --> 00:38:24.127
for any weapons purposes.

869
00:38:24.127 --> 00:38:26.871
It can only be used for,

870
00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:28.658
for instance, nuclear power plants.

871
00:38:28.658 --> 00:38:29.694
That's right.

872
00:38:29.694 --> 00:38:34.029
And the city of London bankers,

873
00:38:34.185 --> 00:38:37.700
the Rothschild's are the Queen's business manager.

874
00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:40.605
And the city of London actually owns

875
00:38:40.605 --> 00:38:42.819
the nuclear power industry,

876
00:38:42.819 --> 00:38:46.760
and the Rothschild's control uranium prices

877
00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.914
and supplies, globally.

878
00:38:48.914 --> 00:38:52.835
We found this out during the 1973

879
00:38:52.835 --> 00:38:55.862
Oil Embargo, when there was a

880
00:38:55.862 --> 00:38:59.526
surplus of uranium on the world market.

881
00:38:59.641 --> 00:39:01.937
But uranium prices started going up

882
00:39:01.937 --> 00:39:05.046
in Westinghouse, and GE,

883
00:39:05.046 --> 00:39:08.358
whose designs are used in 85%

884
00:39:08.358 --> 00:39:11.385
of civilian reactors around the world,

885
00:39:11.385 --> 00:39:15.489
they also guarantee the uranium fuel prices

886
00:39:15.489 --> 00:39:18.577
when they sell the reactors to different countries

887
00:39:18.577 --> 00:39:19.857
or entities.

888
00:39:19.857 --> 00:39:22.437
And so, they got mad because they had to

889
00:39:22.437 --> 00:39:24.557
make up the difference.

890
00:39:24.557 --> 00:39:26.853
They had to eat that increase

891
00:39:26.853 --> 00:39:28.743
in uranium prices.

892
00:39:28.743 --> 00:39:31.140
So they hired Dr. Jake Ghould,

893
00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.368
a world class statistician

894
00:39:33.368 --> 00:39:35.765
to find out why the prices were going up.

895
00:39:35.765 --> 00:39:39.448
And he's the one who unmasked the Queen.

896
00:39:39.706 --> 00:39:41.982
<v Voiceover>So, what does this look like for</v>

897
00:39:41.982 --> 00:39:43.668
what does this look like now for

898
00:39:43.668 --> 00:39:45.680
the population of the world at large,

899
00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.650
in terms of, can you give us an idea

900
00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:50.617
of what areas, what countries are super vulnerable.

901
00:39:50.617 --> 00:39:53.359
I mean, obviously we're seeing the effects

902
00:39:53.359 --> 00:39:54.782
in the Middle East right now.

903
00:39:54.782 --> 00:39:57.240
And move out from there, which are more vulnerable,

904
00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.276
which are less vulnerable,

905
00:39:58.276 --> 00:40:00.186
and what we can expect to see for overall health

906
00:40:00.186 --> 00:40:01.933
patterns.
<v ->It's</v>

907
00:40:01.933 --> 00:40:03.559
it's just global.

908
00:40:03.559 --> 00:40:04.696
It's everywhere.

909
00:40:04.696 --> 00:40:05.997
What's going to happen

910
00:40:05.997 --> 00:40:07.581
and what's happening now

911
00:40:07.581 --> 00:40:10.609
is that it's going to dis-proportionally affect

912
00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:11.665
third world countries,

913
00:40:11.665 --> 00:40:13.148
which we want to target anyways,

914
00:40:13.148 --> 00:40:15.993
so we can steal their resources.

915
00:40:15.993 --> 00:40:18.735
They can't afford medical care,

916
00:40:18.735 --> 00:40:20.523
or they have no medical care,

917
00:40:20.523 --> 00:40:22.108
in their countries.

918
00:40:22.108 --> 00:40:25.562
In more developed countries,

919
00:40:25.562 --> 00:40:29.916
the, particularly the middle class,

920
00:40:30.235 --> 00:40:33.201
will end up spending all their money,

921
00:40:33.201 --> 00:40:35.477
their resources to stay alive.

922
00:40:35.477 --> 00:40:38.626
And when they're out of money

923
00:40:38.626 --> 00:40:40.596
that's the end of their lives.

924
00:40:40.596 --> 00:40:42.506
That's happening in India now.

925
00:40:42.506 --> 00:40:43.827
People are selling,

926
00:40:43.827 --> 00:40:46.001
women are selling all their gold jewelry

927
00:40:46.001 --> 00:40:47.850
to keep their husbands alive,

928
00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:50.003
or to stay alive themselves.

929
00:40:50.003 --> 00:40:52.380
And when that's gone, they sell their house

930
00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:54.717
and then they're living on the streets.

931
00:40:54.717 --> 00:40:57.216
There's no medical care in India.

932
00:40:57.216 --> 00:40:59.532
<v Voiceover>What kind of medical care does one get</v>

933
00:40:59.532 --> 00:41:01.706
if they can afford medical care?

934
00:41:01.706 --> 00:41:03.981
And how well does it combat

935
00:41:03.981 --> 00:41:06.744
these very, as you say, so many

936
00:41:06.744 --> 00:41:09.325
hidden symptoms behind this?

937
00:41:09.325 --> 00:41:12.779
<v ->It's we're in an epidemic of chronic illnesses.</v>

938
00:41:12.779 --> 00:41:14.201
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->Chronic fatigue</v>

939
00:41:14.201 --> 00:41:15.968
syndrome, MS,

940
00:41:15.968 --> 00:41:19.419
neurological and neuromuscular diseases.

941
00:41:20.319 --> 00:41:21.799
<v Voiceover>Cancers of every kind.</v>

942
00:41:21.799 --> 00:41:25.652
<v ->Cancers, cancer are just the tip of the iceberg.</v>

943
00:41:25.652 --> 00:41:27.488
Infertility,

944
00:41:27.488 --> 00:41:30.522
babies that are never healthy.

945
00:41:30.698 --> 00:41:34.300
They're plagued with obesity, diabetes,

946
00:41:34.701 --> 00:41:36.407
learning disabilities.

947
00:41:36.407 --> 00:41:39.624
Over 12% of American children today are disabled.

948
00:41:40.146 --> 00:41:41.344
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->And you know</v>

949
00:41:41.344 --> 00:41:43.376
I talked, I'm a mother.

950
00:41:43.376 --> 00:41:46.078
I talk to lots of mothers and grandmothers,

951
00:41:46.078 --> 00:41:49.654
and they know there's some environmental toxin,

952
00:41:49.654 --> 00:41:52.803
there's something wrong,

953
00:41:52.803 --> 00:41:55.200
because they know the children and the grandchildren

954
00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.724
are not healthy.

955
00:41:56.724 --> 00:41:59.244
But when I talk to people,

956
00:41:59.244 --> 00:42:01.946
and I've been in 46 countries now,

957
00:42:01.946 --> 00:42:03.774
trying to educate the public

958
00:42:03.774 --> 00:42:06.639
and government officials, and ambassadors,

959
00:42:06.639 --> 00:42:10.073
and the media, and the mothers,

960
00:42:10.073 --> 00:42:12.110
and the fathers.

961
00:42:12.632 --> 00:42:16.438
People really do understand now.

962
00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:19.277
At first they were very resistant

963
00:42:19.277 --> 00:42:20.862
when I mentioned depopulation,

964
00:42:20.862 --> 00:42:23.097
I mean, I had some really big battles.

965
00:42:23.097 --> 00:42:24.458
(laughing)

966
00:42:24.458 --> 00:42:26.774
<v ->But it usually takes about a year or two.</v>

967
00:42:26.774 --> 00:42:28.317
<v Voiceover>You have to warm people up to that one.</v>

968
00:42:28.317 --> 00:42:30.228
<v ->Yes, they come back to me,</v>

969
00:42:30.228 --> 00:42:32.057
and what I say is,

970
00:42:32.057 --> 00:42:33.743
"Okay, you don't believe what I'm saying,

971
00:42:33.743 --> 00:42:37.380
"but it's too late, I put a Velcro patch on your brain."

972
00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.761
(laughing)
"And all this

973
00:42:38.761 --> 00:42:42.012
"information that flies by is gonna stick there.

974
00:42:42.012 --> 00:42:44.469
"And you're going to build your own database

975
00:42:44.469 --> 00:42:45.730
"of information.

976
00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:47.862
"And you will begin to realize

977
00:42:47.862 --> 00:42:51.073
"that all this information I've given you,

978
00:42:51.073 --> 00:42:53.571
"is government and military information,

979
00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:57.417
"I can't make it up, I would be immediately attacked."

980
00:42:57.675 --> 00:43:00.662
And they come back and they're furious.

981
00:43:00.662 --> 00:43:03.506
They say, "Not only is everything true

982
00:43:03.506 --> 00:43:05.111
"that you told us.

983
00:43:05.111 --> 00:43:08.140
"But it's much worse than you told us."

984
00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:09.418
(laughs)
<v Voiceover>There you go.</v>

985
00:43:09.418 --> 00:43:11.369
Once you start unraveling that one.

986
00:43:11.369 --> 00:43:12.853
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>So the very</v>

987
00:43:12.853 --> 00:43:16.002
people that are essentially

988
00:43:16.002 --> 00:43:17.973
creating this havoc on the planet,

989
00:43:17.973 --> 00:43:19.475
are trying to garner all the resources,

990
00:43:19.475 --> 00:43:20.797
poisoning the rest of us,

991
00:43:20.797 --> 00:43:23.966
how do they avoid suffering the same exact symptoms

992
00:43:23.966 --> 00:43:26.547
as everybody else on the planet?

993
00:43:26.547 --> 00:43:29.492
<v ->Well do you mean George Herbert Walker Bush</v>

994
00:43:29.492 --> 00:43:31.097
and his wife Barbara?

995
00:43:31.097 --> 00:43:32.478
<v Voiceover>Yep, to begin.</v>

996
00:43:32.478 --> 00:43:33.738
Yes.
<v ->Who had their</v>

997
00:43:33.738 --> 00:43:35.750
thyroid glands removed

998
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:40.002
because they had cancer from atmospheric testing fallout.

999
00:43:40.422 --> 00:43:42.535
And all of their six children,

1000
00:43:42.535 --> 00:43:43.978
every one of them,

1001
00:43:43.978 --> 00:43:47.174
had learning disabilities as a result.

1002
00:43:47.513 --> 00:43:50.765
The mothers thyroid sends hormones,

1003
00:43:50.765 --> 00:43:53.263
or signals to the mothers brain.

1004
00:43:53.263 --> 00:43:55.315
And the mothers brain sends signals

1005
00:43:55.315 --> 00:43:57.225
to the brain of the fetus.

1006
00:43:57.225 --> 00:43:59.358
Her brain controls the development

1007
00:43:59.358 --> 00:44:01.064
of the brain in the fetus.

1008
00:44:01.064 --> 00:44:03.401
All of Barbara Bush's children

1009
00:44:03.401 --> 00:44:06.754
were born with learning disabilities.

1010
00:44:06.754 --> 00:44:07.667
<v Voiceover>So in other words,</v>

1011
00:44:07.667 --> 00:44:09.192
they're pooping in their own nest.

1012
00:44:09.192 --> 00:44:09.822
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>What is</v>

1013
00:44:09.822 --> 00:44:11.385
the point of all this?

1014
00:44:11.385 --> 00:44:14.779
<v ->And Rehnquist, the Supreme Court Judge,</v>

1015
00:44:14.779 --> 00:44:16.913
died of thyroid cancer.

1016
00:44:16.913 --> 00:44:20.569
He dismissed two lawsuits against the US government

1017
00:44:20.569 --> 00:44:24.374
by radiation survivors and atomic veterans.

1018
00:44:24.877 --> 00:44:27.767
Isn't that just ironic?

1019
00:44:28.045 --> 00:44:29.935
That he would die of thyroid cancer?

1020
00:44:29.935 --> 00:44:31.012
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1021
00:44:31.012 --> 00:44:32.135
Yes.

1022
00:44:32.679 --> 00:44:33.882
Okay.

1023
00:44:34.283 --> 00:44:36.213
So in other words, the answer is they don't.

1024
00:44:36.213 --> 00:44:37.453
<v ->They don't.
<v Voiceover>They don't</v>

1025
00:44:37.453 --> 00:44:38.651
avoid it.
<v ->They don't.</v>

1026
00:44:38.651 --> 00:44:40.724
<v Voiceover>So in a sense, we're all in this together.</v>

1027
00:44:40.724 --> 00:44:41.658
And what's going to,

1028
00:44:41.658 --> 00:44:44.929
what in the world can stop it now?

1029
00:44:44.929 --> 00:44:46.763
<v ->Awareness.</v>

1030
00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:49.684
That's why I'm on this campaign

1031
00:44:49.684 --> 00:44:52.230
to educate the public.

1032
00:44:52.508 --> 00:44:54.418
You see the anti war groups,

1033
00:44:54.418 --> 00:44:55.942
the anti nuclear groups

1034
00:44:55.942 --> 00:44:58.358
have focused on the politics

1035
00:44:58.358 --> 00:45:00.370
and the big nukes

1036
00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:03.687
while the whole entire time,

1037
00:45:03.844 --> 00:45:06.282
since Hiroshima and Nagasaki

1038
00:45:06.282 --> 00:45:09.350
there's been a nuclear war being conducted.

1039
00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:11.869
From atmospheric testing,

1040
00:45:11.869 --> 00:45:14.368
the emissions from nuclear power plants,

1041
00:45:14.368 --> 00:45:16.238
and now the global pollution

1042
00:45:16.238 --> 00:45:17.741
with depleted uranium.

1043
00:45:17.741 --> 00:45:20.362
And it's a cumulative effect.

1044
00:45:20.362 --> 00:45:21.906
And if you look at cancer

1045
00:45:21.906 --> 00:45:23.654
increases heart disease,

1046
00:45:23.654 --> 00:45:27.357
increases brain disease, increases,

1047
00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.358
they all correlate with the introduction

1048
00:45:30.358 --> 00:45:34.143
of these nuclear technology since 1945.

1049
00:45:35.992 --> 00:45:38.423
So we have to turn it all off

1050
00:45:38.423 --> 00:45:42.230
and the Queen will just have to mine something else

1051
00:45:42.732 --> 00:45:46.639
if she wants to make vast profits.

1052
00:45:46.997 --> 00:45:50.391
And the city of London will have to

1053
00:45:50.391 --> 00:45:53.763
shift to other energy technologies

1054
00:45:53.763 --> 00:45:56.180
if they want to control energy sources

1055
00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:58.029
around the world.

1056
00:45:58.029 --> 00:46:01.178
Now, Henry Kissinger said something very profound.

1057
00:46:01.178 --> 00:46:04.532
He said, "If you want to control a country,

1058
00:46:04.532 --> 00:46:07.017
"you must control the food.

1059
00:46:07.456 --> 00:46:10.077
"If you want to control a region,

1060
00:46:10.077 --> 00:46:12.501
"you must control the energy.

1061
00:46:14.446 --> 00:46:17.737
"If you want to control the world,

1062
00:46:17.737 --> 00:46:19.978
"you control the banking."

1063
00:46:20.845 --> 00:46:22.376
And that's,

1064
00:46:22.919 --> 00:46:25.099
that's the hierarchy.

1065
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:29.095
The Homeland Security Law Enforcement

1066
00:46:29.095 --> 00:46:31.716
in the military now have control

1067
00:46:31.716 --> 00:46:33.381
of American food supplies.

1068
00:46:33.381 --> 00:46:35.047
They can go into a city and lock up

1069
00:46:35.047 --> 00:46:38.041
all the food, in a flash.

1070
00:46:39.639 --> 00:46:42.971
The US, and the British, the Zionists,

1071
00:46:42.971 --> 00:46:45.307
Anglo-American economic empire,

1072
00:46:45.307 --> 00:46:47.807
is now trying to gain control of

1073
00:46:47.807 --> 00:46:51.443
all the energy sources around Asia

1074
00:46:51.443 --> 00:46:53.576
because China is.

1075
00:46:53.576 --> 00:46:55.385
It's actually the tiger economies.

1076
00:46:55.385 --> 00:46:58.148
China, Korea, Japan, and India,

1077
00:46:58.148 --> 00:46:59.874
who is the greatest threat

1078
00:46:59.874 --> 00:47:04.107
to the higomony of the London and Wall Street bankers.

1079
00:47:05.136 --> 00:47:08.246
The US is just being used as a military proxy

1080
00:47:08.246 --> 00:47:10.094
for the city of London.

1081
00:47:10.094 --> 00:47:13.068
And actually all the centuries

1082
00:47:13.068 --> 00:47:15.308
of warfare of the

1083
00:47:15.308 --> 00:47:18.735
British empire bankrupted the country.

1084
00:47:18.952 --> 00:47:22.345
So, they're just going to bankrupt the US instead.

1085
00:47:22.345 --> 00:47:26.658
And the bankers just go on with that

1086
00:47:26.714 --> 00:47:29.253
higalian dialectic, where they keep setting up

1087
00:47:29.253 --> 00:47:31.833
two opposites who conduct warfare.

1088
00:47:31.833 --> 00:47:33.398
They loan money to both sides.

1089
00:47:33.398 --> 00:47:35.774
They don't really care who wins.

1090
00:47:36.434 --> 00:47:37.867
Or who loses.

1091
00:47:37.867 --> 00:47:39.818
And then they just set up another one.

1092
00:47:39.818 --> 00:47:42.987
So Hiroshima and

1093
00:47:42.987 --> 00:47:44.898
Nagasaki set up a cold war

1094
00:47:44.898 --> 00:47:48.027
between the Soviet Union and the US.

1095
00:47:48.027 --> 00:47:51.277
And the introduction of nuclear pollution

1096
00:47:51.277 --> 00:47:54.594
to depopulate the global population.

1097
00:47:54.853 --> 00:47:57.351
And the Cold War has ended

1098
00:47:57.351 --> 00:48:00.825
and now the new war is against China,

1099
00:48:00.825 --> 00:48:02.349
the tiger economies.

1100
00:48:02.349 --> 00:48:05.092
But this is a radioactive opium war,

1101
00:48:05.092 --> 00:48:08.796
instead of just a drug opium war.

1102
00:48:09.236 --> 00:48:13.077
And they want to eliminate two to four billion

1103
00:48:13.077 --> 00:48:15.211
people, which is one third to two third

1104
00:48:15.211 --> 00:48:17.749
of the worlds planet.

1105
00:48:17.749 --> 00:48:20.411
Now something that I like to do

1106
00:48:20.411 --> 00:48:22.078
when I'm giving a talk,

1107
00:48:22.078 --> 00:48:23.581
especially when there are a lot of people

1108
00:48:23.581 --> 00:48:26.995
in the room, is I ask a question,

1109
00:48:26.995 --> 00:48:29.594
"How many of you have diabetes,

1110
00:48:29.594 --> 00:48:32.541
"or know someone who has diabetes?"

1111
00:48:32.541 --> 00:48:35.406
And at least 95% of the hands go up.

1112
00:48:35.406 --> 00:48:37.071
<v Voiceover>Sure.</v>
<v ->I know</v>

1113
00:48:37.071 --> 00:48:40.443
from my investigations of disease rates,

1114
00:48:40.443 --> 00:48:44.472
that diabetes was very rare before 1945.

1115
00:48:44.751 --> 00:48:46.579
And if a child had it,

1116
00:48:46.579 --> 00:48:49.445
they almost always diedbefore they were seven.

1117
00:48:49.445 --> 00:48:52.513
So even the genes weren't passed on.

1118
00:48:52.513 --> 00:48:57.212
So why are we in an epidemic of diabetes?

1119
00:48:57.632 --> 00:48:59.521
The cancer is going to double,

1120
00:48:59.521 --> 00:49:02.854
or go up 50% by in the next

1121
00:49:02.854 --> 00:49:04.581
10 or 15 years.

1122
00:49:04.581 --> 00:49:08.366
But diabetes is going to go up at least 10 times.

1123
00:49:08.847 --> 00:49:12.017
In fact in some regions, like Canada,

1124
00:49:12.017 --> 00:49:15.207
they've already reached the diabetes

1125
00:49:15.207 --> 00:49:18.863
increased rates that are expected

1126
00:49:18.863 --> 00:49:20.347
by 2020.

1127
00:49:20.347 --> 00:49:22.134
They're already there now.

1128
00:49:22.134 --> 00:49:25.162
So this is bankrupting governments

1129
00:49:25.162 --> 00:49:27.153
all over the world.
<v Voiceover>Sure.</v>

1130
00:49:27.153 --> 00:49:29.346
<v ->And the Europe,</v>

1131
00:49:29.346 --> 00:49:31.114
because of Chernobyl,

1132
00:49:31.114 --> 00:49:35.056
is in a very, very serious diabetes crisis.

1133
00:49:35.056 --> 00:49:36.782
And they've asked the European Parliament

1134
00:49:36.782 --> 00:49:39.121
and the United Nations to help.

1135
00:49:39.121 --> 00:49:42.573
And what an admiral in India told me,

1136
00:49:43.093 --> 00:49:46.866
in February of 2007, on my speaking tour,

1137
00:49:47.327 --> 00:49:51.044
he said, "Leuren, I've inspected

1138
00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:55.013
"nuclear power plants all over Russia."

1139
00:49:55.474 --> 00:49:57.242
He said, "There's so many,

1140
00:49:57.242 --> 00:49:59.009
"there are 12 layers of safe guards

1141
00:49:59.009 --> 00:50:01.367
"that have to be dismantled

1142
00:50:01.367 --> 00:50:04.637
"before something like Chernobyl could happen."

1143
00:50:04.637 --> 00:50:08.111
He said, "There's no way Chernobyl was an accident."

1144
00:50:08.111 --> 00:50:09.352
I said, "Well you know,

1145
00:50:09.352 --> 00:50:11.647
"I was a little more lab then.

1146
00:50:11.647 --> 00:50:13.273
"Or right after that,

1147
00:50:13.273 --> 00:50:17.641
"and I believe the Department of Energy

1148
00:50:17.641 --> 00:50:19.773
"was somehow involved."

1149
00:50:19.773 --> 00:50:23.491
Livermore was overly interested in Chernobyl

1150
00:50:23.491 --> 00:50:27.413
and sent people over to write the cover up

1151
00:50:27.413 --> 00:50:31.482
for the United States on the Chernobyl accident.

1152
00:50:32.066 --> 00:50:34.591
It couldn't have been an accident.

1153
00:50:34.767 --> 00:50:38.390
And Chernobyl is the Russian word

1154
00:50:38.932 --> 00:50:40.679
for worm wood.

1155
00:50:40.679 --> 00:50:44.664
And worm wood is a prophecy, or a passage

1156
00:50:44.664 --> 00:50:49.322
in the bible, that refers to

1157
00:50:50.312 --> 00:50:54.626
sort of a global death from an invisible cause.

1158
00:50:56.611 --> 00:50:58.602
<v Voiceover>Well, and you've been trying to</v>

1159
00:50:58.602 --> 00:51:00.471
alert people to this.

1160
00:51:00.471 --> 00:51:01.466
<v ->Yes, and people to
<v Voiceover>Yes,</v>

1161
00:51:01.466 --> 00:51:05.068
well I don't want to say impending doom.

1162
00:51:05.285 --> 00:51:07.257
<v ->Ongoing.
<v Voiceover>It's ongoing.</v>

1163
00:51:07.257 --> 00:51:08.516
<v ->Ongoing.
<v Voiceover>Ongoing problem</v>

1164
00:51:08.516 --> 00:51:10.811
we have, as a species.

1165
00:51:10.811 --> 00:51:12.680
You've been doing this for a long time now

1166
00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:13.616
and people are starting to,

1167
00:51:13.616 --> 00:51:14.916
more people are starting to listen.

1168
00:51:14.916 --> 00:51:15.546
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>So I</v>

1169
00:51:15.546 --> 00:51:17.334
guess we can say the hope is--

1170
00:51:17.334 --> 00:51:18.735
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>in the way</v>

1171
00:51:18.735 --> 00:51:21.173
information can flow now,

1172
00:51:21.173 --> 00:51:22.778
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>and to</v>

1173
00:51:22.778 --> 00:51:24.201
figure out how we can somehow

1174
00:51:24.201 --> 00:51:25.806
disengage from the system,

1175
00:51:25.806 --> 00:51:27.188
or stop the system I guess.
<v ->Yes.</v>

1176
00:51:27.188 --> 00:51:28.873
<v Voiceover>That's the second tier of</v>

1177
00:51:28.873 --> 00:51:29.910
this whole thing.

1178
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:31.433
And we're going to come back

1179
00:51:31.433 --> 00:51:33.526
and talk with you again very soon

1180
00:51:33.526 --> 00:51:36.329
to find out more about the invisible hand.

1181
00:51:36.329 --> 00:51:38.969
And also about your own journey through this

1182
00:51:38.969 --> 00:51:41.102
because it's not been an easy one for you.

1183
00:51:41.102 --> 00:51:42.118
<v ->There's always hope.</v>

1184
00:51:42.118 --> 00:51:43.501
<v Voiceover>And you're still smiling.</v>

1185
00:51:43.501 --> 00:51:44.759
That's the amazing thing,

1186
00:51:44.759 --> 00:51:46.039
you're still smiling.

1187
00:51:46.039 --> 00:51:47.177
And there is always hope.

1188
00:51:47.177 --> 00:51:47.971
<v ->There's always hope.</v>

1189
00:51:47.971 --> 00:51:49.108
<v Voiceover>And let's talk about the hope.</v>

1190
00:51:49.108 --> 00:51:51.383
We'll talk about all of that.

1191
00:51:51.383 --> 00:51:52.278
Well, first of all,

1192
00:51:52.278 --> 00:51:53.639
the hope in this situation,

1193
00:51:53.639 --> 00:51:54.674
what can individuals,

1194
00:51:54.674 --> 00:51:56.381
or mothers or families do right now

1195
00:51:56.381 --> 00:51:58.372
for themselves, in terms of just,

1196
00:51:58.372 --> 00:51:59.673
are there anything,

1197
00:51:59.673 --> 00:52:00.586
is there anything you can do

1198
00:52:00.586 --> 00:52:01.988
just to boost the immune system

1199
00:52:01.988 --> 00:52:04.631
even to make ourselves less vulnerable to all of this?

1200
00:52:04.631 --> 00:52:05.422
<v ->Yes.
<v Voiceover>We'll end</v>

1201
00:52:05.422 --> 00:52:06.844
on that note, and we're gonna pick up a

1202
00:52:06.844 --> 00:52:07.982
second conversation later.

1203
00:52:07.982 --> 00:52:08.551
<v ->Yes.</v>

1204
00:52:08.551 --> 00:52:11.273
It's very, very important to,

1205
00:52:11.273 --> 00:52:13.935
for instance, buy dairy products

1206
00:52:13.935 --> 00:52:16.860
from nuclear free dairies.

1207
00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:18.892
These are dairies that are not located

1208
00:52:18.892 --> 00:52:21.190
downwind from nuclear power plants.

1209
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:23.301
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>
<v ->You can also</v>

1210
00:52:23.301 --> 00:52:27.567
use reverse osmosis filters on your drinking water,

1211
00:52:27.567 --> 00:52:29.539
that's extremely important.

1212
00:52:29.539 --> 00:52:32.545
That removes most radio nuclides,

1213
00:52:32.545 --> 00:52:34.577
or many of the serious ones,

1214
00:52:34.577 --> 00:52:36.243
such as strontium 90,

1215
00:52:36.243 --> 00:52:38.545
from the drinking water.

1216
00:52:38.864 --> 00:52:41.281
Another thing that's extremely important

1217
00:52:41.281 --> 00:52:44.552
is to boost the immune system by eating

1218
00:52:44.552 --> 00:52:46.889
very, very nutritious food.

1219
00:52:46.889 --> 00:52:50.755
And that means highly colored fruits and vegetables,

1220
00:52:51.176 --> 00:52:54.203
pomegranate juice, blueberries.

1221
00:52:54.203 --> 00:52:55.605
There are--
<v Voiceover>High levels</v>

1222
00:52:55.605 --> 00:52:57.535
of antioxidants.
<v ->High levels</v>

1223
00:52:57.535 --> 00:52:59.648
of antioxidants, that's right.

1224
00:52:59.648 --> 00:53:01.173
Very, very important.

1225
00:53:01.173 --> 00:53:03.347
We all have cancer cells.

1226
00:53:03.347 --> 00:53:04.199
In our body.

1227
00:53:04.199 --> 00:53:05.255
Everybody does.

1228
00:53:05.255 --> 00:53:07.206
But our immune system,

1229
00:53:07.206 --> 00:53:09.198
because it's functioning,

1230
00:53:09.198 --> 00:53:11.818
keeps the cancer in check.

1231
00:53:11.818 --> 00:53:14.684
Prevents it from losing its growth control

1232
00:53:14.684 --> 00:53:16.633
mechanism and just going wild.

1233
00:53:16.633 --> 00:53:18.157
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->And</v>

1234
00:53:18.157 --> 00:53:23.020
so it's very important to keep our bodies

1235
00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:25.572
and our immune systems

1236
00:53:25.572 --> 00:53:28.627
in just shipshape.

1237
00:53:28.904 --> 00:53:30.145
<v Voiceover>As best we can.</v>

1238
00:53:30.145 --> 00:53:30.895
<v ->Yes, yes.
<v Voiceover>Natural sources</v>

1239
00:53:30.895 --> 00:53:32.481
of antioxidants.
<v ->That's right.</v>

1240
00:53:32.481 --> 00:53:33.416
<v Voiceover>Clean, pure water.</v>

1241
00:53:33.416 --> 00:53:34.614
Don't drink from dairies

1242
00:53:34.614 --> 00:53:36.178
that are anywhere near a nuclear facility.

1243
00:53:36.178 --> 00:53:37.681
Certainly downstream from them.

1244
00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:39.924
<v ->That's right.
<v Voiceover>Anything else?</v>

1245
00:53:39.924 --> 00:53:42.666
And people should have

1246
00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:45.003
love and caring

1247
00:53:45.097 --> 00:53:49.268
and good will and happiness.

1248
00:53:49.689 --> 00:53:52.580
And to feel safe and loved.

1249
00:53:52.859 --> 00:53:54.321
That's very, very important.

1250
00:53:54.321 --> 00:53:55.764
<v Voiceover>Yes, the emotional component.</v>

1251
00:53:55.764 --> 00:53:57.756
<v ->Yes, very important.</v>

1252
00:53:57.756 --> 00:54:00.097
Meditation, because

1253
00:54:00.316 --> 00:54:03.795
stress damages your immune system too.

1254
00:54:03.851 --> 00:54:04.926
<v Voiceover>Yes it does.</v>

1255
00:54:04.926 --> 00:54:06.003
<v ->And even when you're going through</v>

1256
00:54:06.003 --> 00:54:07.386
difficult times,

1257
00:54:07.386 --> 00:54:09.985
you should still have truth and beauty

1258
00:54:09.985 --> 00:54:12.269
and love in your life.

1259
00:54:12.953 --> 00:54:14.172
<v Voiceover>Thank you so much.</v>

1260
00:54:14.172 --> 00:54:16.676
I can see that you do. (laughs)

1261
00:54:16.914 --> 00:54:18.295
And I hear you make a mean biscotti,

1262
00:54:18.295 --> 00:54:19.555
I can't wait to try one.

1263
00:54:19.555 --> 00:54:21.024
(laughing)

1264
00:54:22.054 --> 00:54:24.066
