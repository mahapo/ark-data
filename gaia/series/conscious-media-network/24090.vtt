1
00:00:00.853 --> 00:00:03.742
<v ->This is a story that I believe will touch your heart</v>

2
00:00:03.742 --> 00:00:05.460
as much as it has ours.

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.028
It's about a man who had reached a point

4
00:00:07.028 --> 00:00:09.694
of total despair and could see no way out.

5
00:00:09.694 --> 00:00:12.895
With his vision so narrowed and with no hope remaining,

6
00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:15.839
he made all of the proper preparations to end his life,

7
00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.685
when at the last hours,

8
00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:20.265
he logged on to our site looking for a miracle,

9
00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:22.077
and found it.

10
00:00:23.502 --> 00:00:27.473 line:15% 
(heartwarming music)

11
00:00:30.846 --> 00:00:33.407
Jeff, it's hard to believe you're the same person

12
00:00:33.407 --> 00:00:35.560
that walked into Lee's office a month ago

13
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.448
ready to end it all.

14
00:00:37.448 --> 00:00:39.486
You're downright sparkling.

15
00:00:39.486 --> 00:00:41.567
What a shift.

16
00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:44.512
Let's just dig right in to the genesis

17
00:00:44.512 --> 00:00:46.764
of how you had found yourself there to begin with,

18
00:00:46.764 --> 00:00:48.406
and where this started in life

19
00:00:48.406 --> 00:00:49.943
because I think there an awful lot of people

20
00:00:49.943 --> 00:00:52.482
out there that have experienced the same feelings

21
00:00:52.482 --> 00:00:53.687
or do at this moment,

22
00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:57.462
and can take great inspiration from your words.

23
00:00:57.462 --> 00:00:59.209
So let's begin,

24
00:00:59.508 --> 00:01:02.338
at what point in your life did you start experiencing

25
00:01:02.338 --> 00:01:04.892
that kind of detachment or pain

26
00:01:04.892 --> 00:01:08.303
to where you really considered seriously ending your life?

27
00:01:08.303 --> 00:01:10.935
<v ->I think it began primarily as a teenager.</v>

28
00:01:10.935 --> 00:01:13.430
Teenage life is difficult in general,

29
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.986
especially these days, I believe.

30
00:01:14.986 --> 00:01:19.223
But for a young, gay teenager it's even more difficult.

31
00:01:19.223 --> 00:01:21.318
I came to the realization, I think at age 13,

32
00:01:21.318 --> 00:01:22.534
that I was gay,

33
00:01:22.534 --> 00:01:24.446
and I lived in an environment that was not supportive

34
00:01:24.446 --> 00:01:25.542
whatsoever.

35
00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:28.507
I felt rejection from members of my family,

36
00:01:28.507 --> 00:01:30.914
rejection from friends at school,

37
00:01:30.914 --> 00:01:32.013
I felt isolated.

38
00:01:32.013 --> 00:01:34.668
I believed that I was the only gay person in our small town

39
00:01:34.668 --> 00:01:35.970
in Ohio,

40
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.601
which today I know isn't true,

41
00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:40.545
but at the time I felt I was the only one,

42
00:01:40.545 --> 00:01:42.264
and it was a horrible depression.

43
00:01:42.264 --> 00:01:43.385
I'd come home from school

44
00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:45.246
and just sleep for hours and hours,

45
00:01:45.246 --> 00:01:47.422
and I would wanna think of ways that I could

46
00:01:47.422 --> 00:01:49.049
end the pain and end the depression

47
00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.884
because it was so painful.

48
00:01:50.884 --> 00:01:52.196
<v ->We were talking a little bit ago,</v>

49
00:01:52.196 --> 00:01:53.482
before the camera was rolling,

50
00:01:53.482 --> 00:01:56.078
about the whole notion of being gay and you had mentioned

51
00:01:56.078 --> 00:01:59.138
in passing, and we didn't follow up on it,

52
00:01:59.138 --> 00:02:02.478
it was interesting because gay goes beyond sexuality,

53
00:02:02.478 --> 00:02:03.398
<v ->Right.</v>

54
00:02:03.398 --> 00:02:04.421
<v ->And what did you mean by that?</v>

55
00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:07.659
<v ->Well being gay is not about sex necessarily.</v>

56
00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.955
I think being gay is really about accepting yourself

57
00:02:10.955 --> 00:02:15.093
and your position or orientation in life to other people.

58
00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:17.088
For the love that you feel for men

59
00:02:17.088 --> 00:02:18.475
and the love that you feel for women.

60
00:02:18.475 --> 00:02:21.327
Being gay doesn't mean that you do not love women.

61
00:02:21.327 --> 00:02:24.006
It's not a sexual issue in nature.

62
00:02:24.006 --> 00:02:26.907
I think it's much broader and very misunderstood

63
00:02:26.907 --> 00:02:28.991
by those who have never experienced what it is

64
00:02:28.991 --> 00:02:30.490
to be gay.

65
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.809
And although a lot of people throughout my lifetime

66
00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:34.846
asked me, when did you choose to be gay?

67
00:02:34.846 --> 00:02:35.806
And I told 'em,

68
00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:37.860
well when did you choose to be straight?

69
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.630
"I don't really know, I was always this way."

70
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.439
Said, well it's the same with us.

71
00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.230
We've always been this way it's just a matter

72
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.958
of when do you accept that,

73
00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.074
and move on.

74
00:02:46.074 --> 00:02:48.604
<v ->So how did your parents and family respond to you?</v>

75
00:02:48.604 --> 00:02:50.856
<v ->Well my mother surprisingly responded pretty well</v>

76
00:02:50.856 --> 00:02:54.333
by the time she knew, and that was probably in my early 30s

77
00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:55.376
when she found out.

78
00:02:55.376 --> 00:02:56.418
But of course as a mother she says,

79
00:02:56.418 --> 00:02:58.677
"Well I always knew there was something different about you,

80
00:02:58.677 --> 00:03:00.789
but I love you and accept you the way you are."

81
00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:03.456
But other members of my family,

82
00:03:03.456 --> 00:03:05.923
particularly those who are very religious,

83
00:03:05.923 --> 00:03:08.697
biblicly, as Christians,

84
00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:12.632
had a very difficult time accepting it and understanding it.

85
00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:14.846
It really affected our relationship to the point

86
00:03:14.846 --> 00:03:16.863
that we really don't talk that much,

87
00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.798
unfortunately.

88
00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:20.468
I'm hopeful that one day they'll come around

89
00:03:20.468 --> 00:03:23.531
and not be so judgmental and will accept me

90
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:25.801
as their family.

91
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.070
<v ->So you went through these very painful beginning years,</v>

92
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.214
in your teenage years of self-discovery, isolation,

93
00:03:32.214 --> 00:03:34.174
and then you went on to do something,

94
00:03:34.174 --> 00:03:36.990
I think it would sound particularly challenging,

95
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.398
you joined the military

96
00:03:38.398 --> 00:03:40.815
and you became an officer,

97
00:03:40.815 --> 00:03:42.796
and you ended up in the Pentagon.

98
00:03:42.796 --> 00:03:43.796
<v ->Right.</v>

99
00:03:43.796 --> 00:03:44.725
<v ->Then what?</v>

100
00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:47.873
This had to have only created only more isolation

101
00:03:47.873 --> 00:03:49.213
internally.

102
00:03:49.213 --> 00:03:51.217
<v ->It's one of those contradictions that many of us</v>

103
00:03:51.217 --> 00:03:52.402
have in life,

104
00:03:52.402 --> 00:03:55.175
that a young, gay teenager who feared the military

105
00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:57.670
by watching Vietnam on television through the 70s

106
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.093
swore off ever joining the military.

107
00:04:00.093 --> 00:04:02.386
And I turned 18 and what did I do?

108
00:04:02.386 --> 00:04:04.401
I joined the military.

109
00:04:05.423 --> 00:04:09.724
As I said, sex was not my defining issue.

110
00:04:09.724 --> 00:04:11.147
I was Jeff,

111
00:04:11.147 --> 00:04:13.334
and I became a medic,

112
00:04:13.334 --> 00:04:16.063
and I flew medevac for about eight years in the military,

113
00:04:16.063 --> 00:04:17.343
lived in the Middle East,

114
00:04:17.343 --> 00:04:20.680
and experienced tremendous amounts of excitement and joy,

115
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.906
and grief and loss.

116
00:04:22.906 --> 00:04:26.154
I was caught up in witch hunts from time to time,

117
00:04:26.154 --> 00:04:28.121
and friends of mine who were thrown out of the military

118
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:29.275
for being gay.

119
00:04:29.275 --> 00:04:32.364
I think that added to the fear that I had been accumulating

120
00:04:32.364 --> 00:04:35.509
throughout my life, which brings us to this interview of why

121
00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:36.941
I even am here,

122
00:04:36.941 --> 00:04:38.984
is the fear that had built up.

123
00:04:38.984 --> 00:04:40.172
Fear of rejection,

124
00:04:40.172 --> 00:04:42.055
fear of the military.
<v ->Discovery.</v>

125
00:04:42.055 --> 00:04:43.950
<v ->Fear of discovery.</v>

126
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.517
But I stuck with it.

127
00:04:45.517 --> 00:04:48.773
I spent 20 years in the Air Force until I retired

128
00:04:48.773 --> 00:04:51.671
the end of 2000,

129
00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:52.886
from the Pentagon,

130
00:04:52.886 --> 00:04:54.545
my last assignment was

131
00:04:54.545 --> 00:04:58.048
in the Directorate for Strategic Planning for the Air Force.

132
00:04:58.048 --> 00:05:01.264
I was a major and I finally called it quits.

133
00:05:01.264 --> 00:05:04.119
<v ->Let's talk about that for Strategic Planning.</v>

134
00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:07.679
Fear was your big issue in life, fear.

135
00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:10.887
Just encased in fear which was creating isolation,

136
00:05:10.887 --> 00:05:12.323
deep, deep depression,

137
00:05:12.323 --> 00:05:16.206
and a need for escape, a desire to escape.

138
00:05:17.217 --> 00:05:19.473
You drew to you

139
00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:23.586
currently a very interesting position at the Pentagon

140
00:05:23.586 --> 00:05:26.527
because your job was to dream of worst-case scenarios.

141
00:05:26.527 --> 00:05:27.734
<v ->That's right.</v>

142
00:05:27.734 --> 00:05:29.987
Ironically, I discovered this more and more now

143
00:05:29.987 --> 00:05:32.280
how we do attract things into our life

144
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.287
and we do create our so-called reality as we perceive it.

145
00:05:36.642 --> 00:05:39.805
I had experiencing fear many times to go to bed at night

146
00:05:39.805 --> 00:05:42.011
and I would think of all the negative scenarios that could

147
00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:43.485
possibly play out for the next day.

148
00:05:43.485 --> 00:05:45.056
Whether it was arguing with my boss,

149
00:05:45.056 --> 00:05:47.357
or having a relationship go sour,

150
00:05:47.357 --> 00:05:49.117
or this problem, that problem.

151
00:05:49.117 --> 00:05:50.818
You'd work yourself up into a frenzy

152
00:05:50.818 --> 00:05:52.273
and your muscles would become tense

153
00:05:52.273 --> 00:05:53.680
and you become excited,

154
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.265
and you realize, wait a minute, stop.

155
00:05:55.265 --> 00:05:57.945
It's just a scenario that you've dreamt.

156
00:05:57.945 --> 00:06:01.223
And ironically, I believe that I attracted to myself

157
00:06:01.223 --> 00:06:03.276
the position at the Pentagon in Strategic Planning

158
00:06:03.276 --> 00:06:06.045
where part of the job was to dream up scenarios,

159
00:06:06.045 --> 00:06:09.094
what could possibly go wrong and could we plan

160
00:06:09.094 --> 00:06:11.761
to avoid that and to thwart these problems

161
00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:14.074
that would affect the military.

162
00:06:15.615 --> 00:06:17.226
I didn't realize it till after I left there,

163
00:06:17.226 --> 00:06:18.575
that my goodness,

164
00:06:18.575 --> 00:06:21.297
I brought on myself because I've become so good

165
00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:24.466
at dreaming up of all the negative possibilities.

166
00:06:24.466 --> 00:06:26.687
<v ->And every one of them encased in fear,</v>

167
00:06:26.687 --> 00:06:28.099
again, always going back to fear.

168
00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.468
So, you left the military along the way,

169
00:06:31.468 --> 00:06:34.014
because you weren't married, living the traditional life,

170
00:06:34.014 --> 00:06:35.962
you had always wanted to be a dad,

171
00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:39.398
and you ended up getting in the foster care system

172
00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:43.216
with some pretty troubled young men.

173
00:06:43.216 --> 00:06:45.996
Can you talk about what happened

174
00:06:45.996 --> 00:06:50.033
and maybe even up through what happened with Ryan,

175
00:06:50.033 --> 00:06:51.749
after you began taking,

176
00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:52.887
yeah, let's talk about that.

177
00:06:52.887 --> 00:06:54.236
'Cause this really all starts playing in

178
00:06:54.236 --> 00:06:55.596
to what's happening now.

179
00:06:55.596 --> 00:06:58.020
<v ->I think too, going back to when I was around 21,</v>

180
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.646
the seeds of this genesis come from

181
00:07:00.646 --> 00:07:02.713
I had a boyfriend who died of a drug overdose

182
00:07:02.713 --> 00:07:05.496
on his 21st birthday, his name was Jeff also.

183
00:07:05.496 --> 00:07:07.197
Of course I had to grieve this internally

184
00:07:07.197 --> 00:07:08.417
and couldn't let anyone know about it,

185
00:07:08.417 --> 00:07:10.282
but I knew that so many young people,

186
00:07:10.282 --> 00:07:12.313
especially young, gay men get caught up in drugs

187
00:07:12.313 --> 00:07:13.762
because there's so much pain.

188
00:07:13.762 --> 00:07:16.015
And I think that sometimes they track that to themselves

189
00:07:16.015 --> 00:07:19.207
to alleviate the pain, and the suffering

190
00:07:19.207 --> 00:07:21.887
that society doles out.

191
00:07:22.527 --> 00:07:24.265
When I retired from the Air Force,

192
00:07:24.265 --> 00:07:28.371
I decided two months after 9/11 after seeing the smoke go up

193
00:07:28.371 --> 00:07:30.671
over my old place of employment,

194
00:07:30.671 --> 00:07:33.381
I thought it's time to get out of town and take my kids.

195
00:07:33.381 --> 00:07:36.562
So I moved to Phoenix, Arizona with no friends or family,

196
00:07:36.562 --> 00:07:39.762
and I thought, okay we're gonna start out fresh.

197
00:07:39.762 --> 00:07:41.462
Boy, it's been the worst

198
00:07:41.462 --> 00:07:43.036
five years of my life,
(chuckling)

199
00:07:43.036 --> 00:07:45.434
the most difficult five years of my life.

200
00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:49.465
My eldest son who I had adopted when I was at the Pentagon,

201
00:07:49.465 --> 00:07:51.415
<v ->Just when you thought things couldn't get worse, right?</v>

202
00:07:51.415 --> 00:07:53.066
<v ->He required hospitalization,</v>

203
00:07:53.066 --> 00:07:54.919
he'd suffered from bipolar disorder

204
00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:57.969
from post traumatic stress disorder, depression,

205
00:07:57.969 --> 00:08:00.850
and that poor kid just began to unravel.

206
00:08:01.516 --> 00:08:02.841
It became really difficult,

207
00:08:02.841 --> 00:08:05.798
and I remember one night he tried to kill me,

208
00:08:05.798 --> 00:08:09.834
and the police took him away and he was on probation.

209
00:08:09.834 --> 00:08:12.348
And through probation,

210
00:08:12.348 --> 00:08:15.348
I was actually offered a job to work Juvenile Probation,

211
00:08:15.348 --> 00:08:17.388
down in Maricopa County.

212
00:08:17.388 --> 00:08:19.497
So I actually worked probation for a while

213
00:08:19.497 --> 00:08:21.492
until then I was offered a position,

214
00:08:21.492 --> 00:08:23.444
someone approached me and said,

215
00:08:23.444 --> 00:08:25.460
"You apparently work real well with teenage boys,

216
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.169
we've got a lot of boys who need a father figure."

217
00:08:28.169 --> 00:08:30.258
And like you said, I've always wanted to be a parent

218
00:08:30.258 --> 00:08:33.039
in an unconventional way without the wife,

219
00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.973
so I knew right away, this is something that I need to do.

220
00:08:35.973 --> 00:08:37.907
And through the adoption of my first son

221
00:08:37.907 --> 00:08:39.133
several years prior to that,

222
00:08:39.133 --> 00:08:41.510
I knew that this is the way to go.

223
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.118
So I left Juvenile Probation

224
00:08:43.118 --> 00:08:45.127
and became a therapeutic foster parent.

225
00:08:45.127 --> 00:08:47.614
And the difference between therapeutic and regular

226
00:08:47.614 --> 00:08:49.820
is the children who do not qualify

227
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.874
for regular foster care because of their

228
00:08:51.874 --> 00:08:54.021
therapeutic needs and their diagnoses

229
00:08:54.021 --> 00:08:56.144
are in specialized trained homes

230
00:08:56.144 --> 00:08:58.025
with therapeutic foster parents.

231
00:08:58.025 --> 00:09:01.869
Who require to be home 24/7 to be with these kids.

232
00:09:01.869 --> 00:09:03.859
That's the direction my life took,

233
00:09:03.859 --> 00:09:07.087
and suddenly the kids began to find me,

234
00:09:07.087 --> 00:09:10.350
and today I have seven children.

235
00:09:10.755 --> 00:09:13.507
<v ->And we'll talk about one of them in a moment.</v>

236
00:09:13.507 --> 00:09:16.726
So you have three adopted children and three foster children

237
00:09:16.726 --> 00:09:18.681
right now.
<v ->That's right.</v>

238
00:09:19.038 --> 00:09:21.850
<v ->These kids that found their way to you,</v>

239
00:09:22.599 --> 00:09:24.637
to say that each one of them has challenges

240
00:09:24.637 --> 00:09:27.552
would be fair, if not an understatement?

241
00:09:27.552 --> 00:09:29.286
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

242
00:09:31.973 --> 00:09:33.658
<v ->What did this journey do to you?</v>

243
00:09:33.658 --> 00:09:36.307
Here you, in your own life are struggling

244
00:09:36.307 --> 00:09:39.774
to keep your own spirits intact

245
00:09:39.774 --> 00:09:41.619
and your will intact,

246
00:09:41.619 --> 00:09:44.036
and then bring in these children,

247
00:09:44.036 --> 00:09:47.275
or attract these children to you that need help as badly.

248
00:09:47.275 --> 00:09:49.040
If not more than you.

249
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.052
What happened in that whole dynamic the last few years?

250
00:09:53.052 --> 00:09:54.558
<v ->I think</v>

251
00:09:56.465 --> 00:09:59.655
to encase this entire scenario is to say that

252
00:09:59.655 --> 00:10:01.464
I've always been a truth seeker and I've been looking

253
00:10:01.464 --> 00:10:03.077
for all these answers that we all ask,

254
00:10:03.077 --> 00:10:04.050
why am I here?

255
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:04.946
What is my purpose?

256
00:10:04.946 --> 00:10:05.970
Where am I going?

257
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.476
Where did I come from?

258
00:10:07.476 --> 00:10:10.528
In the back of my mind I'd always ask those questions.

259
00:10:10.528 --> 00:10:13.450
And through my difficult life being gay and in the military,

260
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:14.839
and the things I'd experience,

261
00:10:14.839 --> 00:10:16.497
it seems as though then I began once again

262
00:10:16.497 --> 00:10:19.826
to attract myself through these other children

263
00:10:19.826 --> 00:10:21.607
and the issues that they have.

264
00:10:21.607 --> 00:10:24.401
My children, they range from gay, to straight,

265
00:10:24.401 --> 00:10:26.813
to black, white, Hispanic,

266
00:10:27.021 --> 00:10:30.744
just multicultural, multifaceted, multi-dynamic.

267
00:10:30.744 --> 00:10:33.637
Their problems are all so unique but they're all difficult

268
00:10:33.637 --> 00:10:35.927
issues that these children have to deal with.

269
00:10:35.927 --> 00:10:38.372
And I see parts of myself in all my kids.

270
00:10:38.372 --> 00:10:41.061
And my kids respond a lot to the way I am,

271
00:10:41.061 --> 00:10:43.270
your children respond to the energy that the parent

272
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:44.317
puts forth.

273
00:10:44.317 --> 00:10:46.238
So when the parent is very centered and stabled,

274
00:10:46.238 --> 00:10:49.040
and peaceful and calm, you'll reflect that and the children

275
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.599
will feed that and you'll see that in them.

276
00:10:52.599 --> 00:10:55.945
But if you're going through depression and difficult times,

277
00:10:55.945 --> 00:10:58.453
boy your kids are gonna reflect that.

278
00:10:58.453 --> 00:11:01.597
In the last five years I really began to view life

279
00:11:01.597 --> 00:11:02.984
as a living hell,

280
00:11:02.984 --> 00:11:05.787
and it was just a horrible place that we were sent to,

281
00:11:05.787 --> 00:11:07.589
and I wanted to leave.

282
00:11:07.589 --> 00:11:09.855
So many horrible things were happening.

283
00:11:09.855 --> 00:11:13.250
I had severe financial issues

284
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:16.522
as a result of one of my children's hospitalizations,

285
00:11:16.522 --> 00:11:19.432
and being sent to a residential treatment center.

286
00:11:19.432 --> 00:11:22.904
Another child who got into crystal meth

287
00:11:22.904 --> 00:11:24.615
and nearly killed himself,

288
00:11:24.615 --> 00:11:26.125
I got him through drug treatment.

289
00:11:26.125 --> 00:11:27.811
Things were just coming at me.

290
00:11:27.811 --> 00:11:30.102
I was being barraged by these things.

291
00:11:30.102 --> 00:11:32.930
Then last year, I think the ultimate hit me,

292
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:35.847
and that was the night my son Ryan died in my arms

293
00:11:35.847 --> 00:11:36.937
at home,

294
00:11:36.937 --> 00:11:38.948
so unexpectedly.

295
00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:42.132
Within five to seven minutes you had a happy child,

296
00:11:42.132 --> 00:11:43.526
and then he was gone.

297
00:11:43.526 --> 00:11:45.001
<v ->What happened?</v>

298
00:11:45.161 --> 00:11:49.006
<v ->I remember it was Easter Sunday, March 27th 2005.</v>

299
00:11:49.006 --> 00:11:51.109
I was watching television in the living room,

300
00:11:51.109 --> 00:11:53.424
my son Ryan was in the bedroom talking on the phone

301
00:11:53.424 --> 00:11:54.641
with a friend,

302
00:11:54.641 --> 00:11:58.303
and he was carving a lid for a goldfish bowl.

303
00:11:58.303 --> 00:12:00.761
He had just gotten a pet frog that day,

304
00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:03.795
and he wanted to put a lid on it to protect it from the cat.

305
00:12:03.795 --> 00:12:05.983
As he was carving it he had the container held

306
00:12:05.983 --> 00:12:07.199
against his chest,

307
00:12:07.199 --> 00:12:08.897
and as he was poking holes into it

308
00:12:08.897 --> 00:12:10.356
the container collapsed,

309
00:12:10.356 --> 00:12:13.044
and the knife went directly into his heart.

310
00:12:13.044 --> 00:12:15.299
And he told his friend on the phone,

311
00:12:15.299 --> 00:12:17.601
"Oh shoot, I just cut myself, I gotta go,"

312
00:12:17.601 --> 00:12:21.567
threw the phone down, pulled the knife out of his heart.

313
00:12:21.567 --> 00:12:23.899
I remember he picked up a sock, covered it with a sock

314
00:12:23.899 --> 00:12:25.020
and came to me and says,

315
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.309
"Dad, I cut myself.

316
00:12:26.309 --> 00:12:27.362
I need help."

317
00:12:27.362 --> 00:12:29.322
And I thought, well lemme get the first aid kit,

318
00:12:29.322 --> 00:12:31.445
'cause boys were always hurtin' themselves

319
00:12:31.445 --> 00:12:33.047
from rough play.

320
00:12:33.047 --> 00:12:35.069
I saw the blood trickling down his chest

321
00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:37.273
and I took him into the bathroom and put a compress on it,

322
00:12:37.273 --> 00:12:40.294
mind you, I was a paramedic for eight years in the military,

323
00:12:40.294 --> 00:12:42.854
so I thought I had a pretty good grasp on what to do.

324
00:12:42.854 --> 00:12:45.064
Few minutes later, he had his arms around me, he says,

325
00:12:45.064 --> 00:12:47.511
"Dad, I'm gonna faint, I'm gonna pass out."

326
00:12:47.511 --> 00:12:49.188
And down he went like a load of bricks.

327
00:12:49.188 --> 00:12:51.748
His glasses flew off, his head hit the toilet,

328
00:12:51.748 --> 00:12:53.156
he was just floundering in my arms

329
00:12:53.156 --> 00:12:56.202
and I screamed and called for my other son to help me.

330
00:12:56.202 --> 00:12:58.795
He came in, I said you gotta help me, Ryan's hurt.

331
00:12:58.795 --> 00:13:00.931
I've gotta call 911.

332
00:13:01.125 --> 00:13:04.014
And after I called 911 and Ryan was laying on the ground,

333
00:13:04.014 --> 00:13:05.359
on the floor in the bathroom,

334
00:13:05.359 --> 00:13:07.145
he just opened his eyes, looked at me and says,

335
00:13:07.145 --> 00:13:09.243
"Dad, I'm okay, I'm okay."

336
00:13:09.243 --> 00:13:10.856
Then he closed his eyes,

337
00:13:10.856 --> 00:13:13.054
his eyes then rolled back, his arms twitched,

338
00:13:13.054 --> 00:13:14.603
he went into shock,

339
00:13:14.603 --> 00:13:16.932
and I picked him up, carried him to the living room

340
00:13:16.932 --> 00:13:18.417
waiting for the paramedics.

341
00:13:18.417 --> 00:13:21.150
And while I was holding him, he passed away.

342
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.712
It was just so surreal, it happened so quickly.

343
00:13:24.712 --> 00:13:27.454
I couldn't process it all, I was in shock.

344
00:13:27.454 --> 00:13:30.283
Of course that began a long period of time

345
00:13:30.283 --> 00:13:31.895
for my family and I

346
00:13:31.895 --> 00:13:35.833
for going through the process of disbelief and denial,

347
00:13:35.833 --> 00:13:38.550
and shock, to getting to the point of acceptance

348
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:39.994
that he was gone so quickly.

349
00:13:39.994 --> 00:13:44.134
<v ->How did that affect you on the deepest levels,</v>

350
00:13:44.358 --> 00:13:47.597
in that you had considered taking your own life

351
00:13:47.597 --> 00:13:50.602
on numerous occasions prior to that as a way

352
00:13:50.602 --> 00:13:54.926
to merge with something more gentle and more kind,

353
00:13:54.926 --> 00:13:57.387
than the world you were experiencing?

354
00:13:57.387 --> 00:14:00.864
How did that all work together in your heart

355
00:14:00.864 --> 00:14:02.182
and in your mind

356
00:14:02.182 --> 00:14:04.885
when here someone who had not chosen to do this,

357
00:14:04.885 --> 00:14:08.050
it was quite by accident, is suddenly gone?

358
00:14:09.054 --> 00:14:10.744
I don't know if that's even a fair question,

359
00:14:10.744 --> 00:14:13.214
it just is coming through my head right now.

360
00:14:13.214 --> 00:14:16.529
<v ->My first thought was how did I attract this into my life?</v>

361
00:14:16.529 --> 00:14:18.129
How did I bring this about?

362
00:14:18.129 --> 00:14:19.665
Course a parent will feel some guilt

363
00:14:19.665 --> 00:14:21.405
that I couldn't protect my child,

364
00:14:21.405 --> 00:14:23.325
that's my job is to protect my child.

365
00:14:23.325 --> 00:14:24.516
But I couldn't do it.

366
00:14:24.516 --> 00:14:28.325
Did I somehow, miraculously draw this into my life?

367
00:14:28.325 --> 00:14:30.278
And I knew right away

368
00:14:30.278 --> 00:14:32.615
there is no guilt, there is no blame,

369
00:14:32.615 --> 00:14:35.253
but why did my son die?

370
00:14:35.253 --> 00:14:38.248
And why did he die at his own hand albeit an accident?

371
00:14:38.248 --> 00:14:39.758
Isn't that the irony?

372
00:14:39.758 --> 00:14:43.047
That I had longed to take my life to find peace and joy,

373
00:14:43.047 --> 00:14:45.927
not just to run from this life but to go somewhere

374
00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:48.910
that was more kind and gentle, as you said.

375
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:50.343
Here it is my son,

376
00:14:50.343 --> 00:14:53.477
apparently found that place, and why?

377
00:14:53.477 --> 00:14:56.433
I spent a year in talk therapy trying to deal

378
00:14:56.433 --> 00:14:58.553
with these issues.

379
00:14:58.553 --> 00:15:01.842
I began devouring books

380
00:15:01.842 --> 00:15:05.291
on after death and near life experiences,

381
00:15:05.291 --> 00:15:08.287
which actually led me to Conscious Media Network.

382
00:15:08.287 --> 00:15:11.090
In part of my search for answers of why my son died

383
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:12.677
and where did he go,

384
00:15:12.677 --> 00:15:15.941
I found a number of interviews on Conscious Media Network

385
00:15:15.941 --> 00:15:17.863
that really alleviated the pain.

386
00:15:17.863 --> 00:15:21.894
And helped me to understand that we survive our death.

387
00:15:21.894 --> 00:15:25.398
We don't really die as these infinite beings.

388
00:15:25.398 --> 00:15:28.505
Our bodies pass away as organic substance,

389
00:15:28.505 --> 00:15:32.526
but our living infinite creative being still exists.

390
00:15:32.526 --> 00:15:36.132
And I knew then that my son was still alive,

391
00:15:36.132 --> 00:15:39.471
and often times with me 'cause I felt him with me.

392
00:15:39.821 --> 00:15:42.468
Which made me extremely grateful,

393
00:15:42.468 --> 00:15:45.576
extremely grateful and I can't express how much

394
00:15:46.246 --> 00:15:47.660
comfort that gave me

395
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.983
through your media network.

396
00:15:49.983 --> 00:15:50.829
<v ->Thank you.</v>

397
00:15:50.829 --> 00:15:52.216
<v ->But even greater things were to come.</v>

398
00:15:52.216 --> 00:15:54.188
<v ->Yes.
<v ->As a result.</v>

399
00:15:55.468 --> 00:15:58.017
<v ->This experienced happened, there was a lot of grieving,</v>

400
00:15:58.017 --> 00:15:59.889
a lot to sort through,

401
00:15:59.889 --> 00:16:02.130
but ultimately you started becoming more and more

402
00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:03.105
depressed.

403
00:16:03.105 --> 00:16:03.904
<v ->Yes.</v>

404
00:16:03.904 --> 00:16:05.811
<v ->And tell us what happened from there.</v>

405
00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:08.640
<v ->Well it seemed like it just began a spiral down.</v>

406
00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.842
Things got worse and I think I was reliving all those

407
00:16:11.842 --> 00:16:13.341
scenarios in my mind every night.

408
00:16:13.341 --> 00:16:14.797
It's like, oh my god, what if another one

409
00:16:14.797 --> 00:16:15.823
of my children die?

410
00:16:15.823 --> 00:16:16.932
How will I handle it?

411
00:16:16.932 --> 00:16:18.346
I'll take my own life.

412
00:16:18.346 --> 00:16:19.761
There were legal issues with my kids,

413
00:16:19.761 --> 00:16:21.027
medical issues with my kids,

414
00:16:21.027 --> 00:16:22.526
every day it was a barrage,

415
00:16:22.526 --> 00:16:24.369
and I was on this downward spiral.

416
00:16:24.369 --> 00:16:26.378
It was getting worse, it was getting worse.

417
00:16:26.378 --> 00:16:28.196
I had no family and friends in Phoenix,

418
00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:30.237
and I had no support network.

419
00:16:30.237 --> 00:16:31.885
It was just me and my kids,

420
00:16:31.885 --> 00:16:34.544
demanding and draining my energy from me every day,

421
00:16:34.544 --> 00:16:36.852
and I wasn't being replenished.

422
00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:39.033
I had gotten to a point,

423
00:16:39.033 --> 00:16:41.452
it was actually toward the end of July,

424
00:16:41.452 --> 00:16:43.238
and I remember

425
00:16:43.567 --> 00:16:46.507
I began planning my exit from this life.

426
00:16:46.507 --> 00:16:49.086
Now mind you, I don't think I ever wanted to commit suicide

427
00:16:49.086 --> 00:16:52.375
as an end, it was a means to an end,

428
00:16:52.375 --> 00:16:53.834
and the end was peace.

429
00:16:53.834 --> 00:16:56.522
Peace and joy and contentment and happiness,

430
00:16:56.522 --> 00:16:58.301
and all the things that I discovered

431
00:16:58.301 --> 00:17:00.349
from people who've written thousands of near death

432
00:17:00.349 --> 00:17:01.666
experiences,

433
00:17:01.666 --> 00:17:03.684
that this is something I really wanted.

434
00:17:03.684 --> 00:17:05.200
It's like, I wanna go to heaven.

435
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.075
I wanna go where life is so wonderful, so peaceful.

436
00:17:09.075 --> 00:17:11.558
There's no fear, no anger, no hatred.

437
00:17:11.558 --> 00:17:14.910
I wanted this so bad that I was willing to commit suicide

438
00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:16.740
in order to gain it.

439
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.428
So I put my plan into action.

440
00:17:19.428 --> 00:17:22.768
I began researching my life insurance policies to ensure

441
00:17:22.768 --> 00:17:24.547
that my kids would get a payout.

442
00:17:24.547 --> 00:17:26.032
I put together a living trust,

443
00:17:26.032 --> 00:17:28.886
I put together my living will, my will.

444
00:17:28.886 --> 00:17:30.968
My do not resuscitate.

445
00:17:30.968 --> 00:17:34.721
In fact, it was the 28th of July

446
00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:38.194
where I signed the documentation for the update of my will

447
00:17:38.194 --> 00:17:40.253
to ensure everything was taken care of.

448
00:17:40.253 --> 00:17:41.535
<v ->That was less than a month ago.</v>

449
00:17:41.535 --> 00:17:43.223
<v ->Right, less than a month ago.</v>

450
00:17:43.223 --> 00:17:45.972
And I had actually picked out the spot where I would

451
00:17:45.972 --> 00:17:48.907
commit suicide and I would do it by gun.

452
00:17:49.536 --> 00:17:52.023
Coincidentally, my grandfather committed suicide

453
00:17:52.023 --> 00:17:53.686
by putting a gun in his mouth,

454
00:17:53.686 --> 00:17:54.826
in his front yard of his home.

455
00:17:54.826 --> 00:17:56.362
But I knew that I wouldn't do that because I don't want

456
00:17:56.362 --> 00:17:58.627
my children to see me like that.

457
00:17:58.627 --> 00:18:00.293
So I found a place out in the desert,

458
00:18:00.293 --> 00:18:01.405
I had my gun,

459
00:18:01.405 --> 00:18:03.045
I even practiced a few times.

460
00:18:03.045 --> 00:18:04.413
Putting the barrel in my mouth,

461
00:18:04.413 --> 00:18:06.526
what it would feel like to prepare myself.

462
00:18:06.526 --> 00:18:09.163
It's in a sense something I didn't really wanna do,

463
00:18:09.163 --> 00:18:11.683
but it was a means to an end.

464
00:18:13.526 --> 00:18:14.811
<v ->So,</v>

465
00:18:15.158 --> 00:18:18.332
you had arrived at the final hours, really.

466
00:18:18.332 --> 00:18:21.777
You had planned on executing the plan,

467
00:18:21.777 --> 00:18:23.185
no pun intended obviously,

468
00:18:23.185 --> 00:18:24.394
the next day.

469
00:18:24.394 --> 00:18:26.468
<v ->Yeah, it was something that was gonna come very quickly</v>

470
00:18:26.468 --> 00:18:29.565
and I knew that I would not reach my 46th birthday,

471
00:18:29.565 --> 00:18:30.982
which was August 20th.

472
00:18:30.982 --> 00:18:32.374
And I had already committed to that,

473
00:18:32.374 --> 00:18:35.665
that I would not go beyond 45 in this world.

474
00:18:35.665 --> 00:18:38.411
This is something that was helping me to set a deadline.

475
00:18:38.411 --> 00:18:40.458
Something that I could meet.

476
00:18:40.882 --> 00:18:43.022
Then I remember it was,

477
00:18:43.022 --> 00:18:46.707
I believe the 26th of July.

478
00:18:46.912 --> 00:18:49.348
I was sitting in my bedroom at my desk, on the computer,

479
00:18:49.348 --> 00:18:52.708
and I just felt this need to find some relief.

480
00:18:52.708 --> 00:18:54.992
So I got on Conscious Media Network again.

481
00:18:54.992 --> 00:18:55.975
(chuckling)

482
00:18:55.975 --> 00:18:57.524
Because I had found so much relief there

483
00:18:57.524 --> 00:18:59.996
from the words of so many wise and brilliant,

484
00:18:59.996 --> 00:19:02.120
talented people that I thought maybe there's something

485
00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.948
there today that could help me.

486
00:19:04.948 --> 00:19:07.770
And sure enough I was looking through there and I saw

487
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.482
and interview that Lee had presented

488
00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:12.875
on Brain State Technology.

489
00:19:12.875 --> 00:19:14.254
At first I thought,

490
00:19:14.254 --> 00:19:16.715
this isn't really something I think that could help me,

491
00:19:16.715 --> 00:19:19.539
but I felt this nudge, take a look at it anyhow.

492
00:19:19.539 --> 00:19:21.771
So I said, okay, I'll look at it.

493
00:19:21.771 --> 00:19:23.148
<v ->And it was one of the newest ones</v>

494
00:19:23.148 --> 00:19:24.659
we had just posted, actually.

495
00:19:24.659 --> 00:19:25.773
<v ->That's right.</v>

496
00:19:25.773 --> 00:19:27.995
And it wasn't the genre that I was accustomed to.

497
00:19:27.995 --> 00:19:29.712
I would go for the heart and soul,

498
00:19:29.712 --> 00:19:33.678
the things that would lift me up and make me feel good.

499
00:19:33.678 --> 00:19:35.660
I thought, technology?

500
00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.835
How could this interest me at this point in my life?

501
00:19:38.835 --> 00:19:40.511
But I watched it.

502
00:19:40.511 --> 00:19:43.443
And toward the end of it I realized, oh my god,

503
00:19:43.443 --> 00:19:46.143
is this a possibility, is this something that could help me?

504
00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:47.668
<v ->Now the bizarre thing is,</v>

505
00:19:47.668 --> 00:19:51.481
we have people watching from about 60 countries.

506
00:19:51.481 --> 00:19:55.395
And our interviewees are from all over.

507
00:19:55.871 --> 00:19:58.331
Coincidence or not, and I'd say not.

508
00:19:58.331 --> 00:20:01.851
You and Lee Gerdes happened to be in the same city.

509
00:20:01.851 --> 00:20:03.528
<v ->Absolutely, it just blew me away.</v>

510
00:20:03.528 --> 00:20:04.526
Because you know what,

511
00:20:04.526 --> 00:20:06.574
I figured, oh he was in Hawaii,

512
00:20:06.574 --> 00:20:08.481
or he was in Florida, somewhere really nice,

513
00:20:08.481 --> 00:20:09.555
or in California.

514
00:20:09.555 --> 00:20:11.207
Somewhere that it wasn't accessible,

515
00:20:11.207 --> 00:20:13.232
and somewhere I couldn't get to.

516
00:20:13.232 --> 00:20:15.526
You know, when depressed and feeling the way I did,

517
00:20:15.526 --> 00:20:18.280
you could barely get up in the morning, tie your shoes.

518
00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.578
Let alone travel a distance for hope.

519
00:20:21.719 --> 00:20:24.119
Then when I realized he was in the area and I thought,

520
00:20:24.119 --> 00:20:26.764
this is too good to be true.

521
00:20:27.101 --> 00:20:28.613
I thought, well I'm gonna give him a call.

522
00:20:28.613 --> 00:20:30.584
So the very next day I called and I said, you know what,

523
00:20:30.584 --> 00:20:32.797
I saw the interview on Conscious Media Network,

524
00:20:32.797 --> 00:20:34.244
I'm very interested,

525
00:20:34.244 --> 00:20:37.072
I need help, is there any way that I can get in?

526
00:20:37.072 --> 00:20:40.549
And they said, we're booked up for about two or three weeks.

527
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:42.627
My heart just sunk and I thought, okay fine.

528
00:20:42.627 --> 00:20:45.353
This is a sick joke the universe is playin' on me.

529
00:20:45.353 --> 00:20:46.773
Teasin' me, fine.

530
00:20:46.773 --> 00:20:48.453
And she said, "Well just a minute, wait a minute.

531
00:20:48.453 --> 00:20:51.434
We just had a cancellation for Friday morning the 28th,"

532
00:20:51.434 --> 00:20:53.213
which was two days away.

533
00:20:53.213 --> 00:20:55.403
"Why don't you come in and we'll do your brain mapping then

534
00:20:55.403 --> 00:20:56.592
and we'll getcha started.

535
00:20:56.592 --> 00:21:00.394
And then we can schedule your sessions in a couple weeks."

536
00:21:00.394 --> 00:21:03.184
I thought okay, well that still doesn't help.

537
00:21:03.184 --> 00:21:04.761
But I decided let's give it a try.

538
00:21:04.761 --> 00:21:07.077
I said okay, well sign me up, I'll be in.

539
00:21:07.077 --> 00:21:09.841
And so I committed myself, hold on for two more days.

540
00:21:09.841 --> 00:21:12.222
But on the day that I was scheduled to come in for my

541
00:21:12.222 --> 00:21:13.861
brain mapping, I thought,

542
00:21:13.861 --> 00:21:15.045
do I really wanna go in?

543
00:21:15.045 --> 00:21:18.392
What if they take away my courage to commit suicide,

544
00:21:18.392 --> 00:21:21.356
and then all I'm left is living in a hell?

545
00:21:21.356 --> 00:21:22.621
What if he takes away my--

546
00:21:22.621 --> 00:21:24.037
<v ->Interesting though, yeah.</v>

547
00:21:24.037 --> 00:21:25.949
<v ->I was afraid that, what if he took that away from me</v>

548
00:21:25.949 --> 00:21:28.022
'cause that's the only thing I had of hope,

549
00:21:28.022 --> 00:21:30.242
is my ability to pull the trigger.

550
00:21:30.252 --> 00:21:32.087
It was my escape pod.

551
00:21:32.087 --> 00:21:34.238
I don't want him to take it away from me and then leave me

552
00:21:34.238 --> 00:21:36.042
with all my problems.

553
00:21:36.042 --> 00:21:38.013
So I came in anyhow,

554
00:21:38.013 --> 00:21:39.742
and I remember they hooked me up

555
00:21:39.742 --> 00:21:42.084
and they did their process.

556
00:21:42.374 --> 00:21:44.277
When they were finished, they told me,

557
00:21:44.277 --> 00:21:46.653
we'll schedule you for a couple weeks,

558
00:21:46.653 --> 00:21:49.205
and I'm like okay, whatever, fine.

559
00:21:49.205 --> 00:21:51.062
Then one of the women came and said,

560
00:21:51.062 --> 00:21:52.446
"You know what, we have a cancellation,

561
00:21:52.446 --> 00:21:53.931
would you come back right now?

562
00:21:53.931 --> 00:21:55.709
And we could start your brain training?"

563
00:21:55.709 --> 00:21:57.604
I'm like yeah, absolutely.

564
00:21:57.604 --> 00:21:59.893
So we went back, I sat in the chair,

565
00:21:59.893 --> 00:22:01.942
and I'll never forget, I was sitting there

566
00:22:01.942 --> 00:22:04.643
and I just started crying because I'd have sudden outburst

567
00:22:04.643 --> 00:22:06.960
of crying from time to time from things that have

568
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.547
built up over the years.

569
00:22:08.547 --> 00:22:10.767
I remember Lee walked in the room

570
00:22:10.767 --> 00:22:12.110
and he was holding my file,

571
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:13.526
and he looked at me, says, "Jeff,

572
00:22:13.526 --> 00:22:15.446
what are you so afraid of?"

573
00:22:15.446 --> 00:22:17.072
<v ->This was after doing the brain mapping?</v>

574
00:22:17.072 --> 00:22:20.286
<v ->After the brain mapping, they knew nothing about my life.</v>

575
00:22:20.286 --> 00:22:22.193
Nothing, absolutely nothing.

576
00:22:22.193 --> 00:22:24.536
I was just a stranger off the street.

577
00:22:24.536 --> 00:22:27.475
He looked at the brain mapping data

578
00:22:27.475 --> 00:22:30.699
and saw that I had an enormous amount of fear.

579
00:22:30.699 --> 00:22:33.260
And he said, "You've got this layer of fear just above

580
00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:36.638
your subconscious that is blocking the energy flow

581
00:22:36.638 --> 00:22:37.932
in your brain."

582
00:22:37.932 --> 00:22:41.324
And he told your brain is less than 8% of your body mass

583
00:22:41.324 --> 00:22:44.074
but requires 40% of your energy,

584
00:22:44.074 --> 00:22:45.953
and you're blocking all this energy.

585
00:22:45.953 --> 00:22:47.670
I thought, yeah I am,

586
00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:49.558
because I'm fatigued all the time,

587
00:22:49.558 --> 00:22:50.774
I'm depressed.

588
00:22:50.774 --> 00:22:53.037
I said I have no energy, I have no hope,

589
00:22:53.037 --> 00:22:54.635
I have nothing.

590
00:22:54.635 --> 00:22:56.577
And he saw that through my brain mapping.

591
00:22:56.577 --> 00:22:58.249
<v ->Amazing.
<v ->It was just absolutely</v>

592
00:22:58.249 --> 00:22:59.231
amazing.

593
00:22:59.231 --> 00:23:00.549
And they did the first session,

594
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:02.231
and I was excited about it,

595
00:23:02.231 --> 00:23:04.232
and I felt something different.

596
00:23:04.232 --> 00:23:06.210
I came out of the session,

597
00:23:06.433 --> 00:23:08.776
of course I was still intending to commit suicide,

598
00:23:08.776 --> 00:23:11.822
it wasn't like instant everything was changed in my life,

599
00:23:11.822 --> 00:23:13.625
but I felt something going on in my head

600
00:23:13.625 --> 00:23:16.199
and I couldn't identify it.

601
00:23:16.613 --> 00:23:18.803
I thought, when could I come back in,

602
00:23:18.803 --> 00:23:20.634
they said, "You know, we just had a cancellation

603
00:23:20.634 --> 00:23:22.977
for 2 o'clock this afternoon."
(chuckling)

604
00:23:22.977 --> 00:23:25.266
I said I'll be there, 2 o'clock.

605
00:23:25.266 --> 00:23:27.941
I went home and came back at two, had another session.

606
00:23:27.941 --> 00:23:30.182
And I was feeling better driving home, thinking,

607
00:23:30.182 --> 00:23:33.394
I donno what it is but something's going on in my brain.

608
00:23:33.394 --> 00:23:35.515
I can't put my finger on it.

609
00:23:36.005 --> 00:23:37.927
I came back the next morning, they said we've got

610
00:23:37.927 --> 00:23:39.655
two cancellations today.

611
00:23:39.655 --> 00:23:40.807
Would you like more sessions?

612
00:23:40.807 --> 00:23:42.586
I said absolutely, sign me up.

613
00:23:42.586 --> 00:23:45.424
I went at 8:30 in the morning, then 11 o'clock.

614
00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:48.682
And I'll never forget driving home at 12 o'clock noon,

615
00:23:48.682 --> 00:23:50.411
thinking to myself,

616
00:23:50.411 --> 00:23:53.137
I don't wanna commit suicide, I wanna live.

617
00:23:53.137 --> 00:23:56.217
And I had done a complete 180 turn around.

618
00:23:56.217 --> 00:23:58.942
Yet again, I couldn't explain why,

619
00:23:58.942 --> 00:24:00.851
and perhaps Lee could explain why,

620
00:24:00.851 --> 00:24:02.463
scientifically speaking.

621
00:24:02.463 --> 00:24:05.458
But I couldn't explain why and it didn't really matter to me

622
00:24:05.458 --> 00:24:08.388
if it was magic or science,

623
00:24:08.388 --> 00:24:11.781
I was different, and I wanted to live.

624
00:24:12.262 --> 00:24:15.629
They signed me up for I think 15 more sessions.

625
00:24:15.629 --> 00:24:17.991
They had cancellation after cancellation

626
00:24:17.991 --> 00:24:19.073
that opened up for me,

627
00:24:19.073 --> 00:24:20.763
and Lee said, "This is so unusual.

628
00:24:20.763 --> 00:24:22.796
We don't usually have this happen."

629
00:24:22.796 --> 00:24:25.037
It was just miraculous, it gives me chills

630
00:24:25.037 --> 00:24:26.739
just to think about it.

631
00:24:26.739 --> 00:24:29.952
That here I am today, less than a month

632
00:24:29.952 --> 00:24:31.078
from--

633
00:24:31.078 --> 00:24:32.294
<v ->Your darkest hours.</v>

634
00:24:32.294 --> 00:24:33.322
<v ->From my darkest hours.</v>

635
00:24:33.322 --> 00:24:34.909
And that's the irony of it all that

636
00:24:34.909 --> 00:24:37.851
in my greatest despair, came my greatest joy

637
00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:40.080
and my greatest hope of life.

638
00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.510
Sometimes I believe that I did attract many of those

639
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:45.558
things into my life to bring me down,

640
00:24:45.558 --> 00:24:48.807
so I could have contrast to know where I wanted to be.

641
00:24:48.807 --> 00:24:51.458
And where I wanted to be is in that state of joy,

642
00:24:51.458 --> 00:24:53.173
that state of happiness.

643
00:24:53.173 --> 00:24:55.579
For so long those were just words and I couldn't

644
00:24:55.579 --> 00:24:57.973
self-actualize what it really meant.

645
00:24:57.973 --> 00:25:01.596
But now, after Brain State Technology

646
00:25:01.596 --> 00:25:03.120
and what Lee has done for me,

647
00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.117
I'm starting to understand

648
00:25:05.117 --> 00:25:06.449
what joy is.

649
00:25:06.449 --> 00:25:08.727
Not by looking up the definition in the dictionary,

650
00:25:08.727 --> 00:25:10.353
but understanding what joy is.

651
00:25:10.353 --> 00:25:13.424
And understanding that I am a creative being,

652
00:25:13.424 --> 00:25:16.291
and that I can create my reality, and I can live in joy

653
00:25:16.291 --> 00:25:18.894
rather than live in fear and pain.

654
00:25:19.628 --> 00:25:23.420
I've had so many amazing synchronistic events take place

655
00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:24.952
in the last four weeks.

656
00:25:24.952 --> 00:25:26.498
It's incredible.

657
00:25:26.498 --> 00:25:28.749
<v ->An epilogue to this story is your children</v>

658
00:25:28.749 --> 00:25:31.715
are the ones that are also benefiting from this.

659
00:25:31.715 --> 00:25:34.674
<v ->Not only are they benefiting from having a happier father</v>

660
00:25:34.674 --> 00:25:36.812
and a father who's more at peace and centered,

661
00:25:36.812 --> 00:25:39.915
but I brought my 19-year-old son in, who's bipolar,

662
00:25:39.915 --> 00:25:43.178
and who has PTSD

663
00:25:43.178 --> 00:25:44.765
and also depression,

664
00:25:44.765 --> 00:25:46.250
and his life is turning around.

665
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.994
He went through I think five or six sessions.

666
00:25:48.994 --> 00:25:51.937
I was actually beginning to do SSI paperwork on him

667
00:25:51.937 --> 00:25:53.831
for Social Security benefits,

668
00:25:53.831 --> 00:25:56.866
and he just got a job two weeks ago.

669
00:25:56.866 --> 00:26:00.049
He quit the job for another job that offered 75 cents more

670
00:26:00.049 --> 00:26:01.634
an hour and closer to home.

671
00:26:01.634 --> 00:26:04.339
It's just amazing, his life is turn around.

672
00:26:04.339 --> 00:26:07.007
It's removed the blockage so that we can create

673
00:26:07.007 --> 00:26:09.464
as the beings that we were intended to be.

674
00:26:09.464 --> 00:26:11.512
To create the realities that we want.

675
00:26:11.512 --> 00:26:13.966
And I feel that I'm on that path now.

676
00:26:14.246 --> 00:26:17.283
(moving orchestral score playing)

677
00:26:17.513 --> 00:26:20.396
<v ->Jeff is shining from the inside out and only one month</v>

678
00:26:20.396 --> 00:26:22.342
has passed since this filming from the days

679
00:26:22.342 --> 00:26:24.094
he was in total despair.

680
00:26:24.094 --> 00:26:26.001
If you want to see more about the technology

681
00:26:26.001 --> 00:26:28.075
that he credits with saving his life,

682
00:26:28.075 --> 00:26:31.246
watch the interview with Lee Gerdes and his cutting edge

683
00:26:31.246 --> 00:26:33.224
Brain State Technologies.

684
00:26:33.224 --> 00:26:34.257
Until next time,

685
00:26:34.257 --> 00:26:36.111
thanks for watching.

686
00:26:36.942 --> 00:26:40.528
(moving orchestral score playing)
