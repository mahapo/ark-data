1
00:00:00.451 --> 00:00:02.632
<v ->I always enjoy talking with Michael Tsarion</v>

2
00:00:02.632 --> 00:00:05.141
and this was perhaps my favorite conversation yet.

3
00:00:05.411 --> 00:00:08.581
Knowing of Michael's deep knowledge of the Druidic culture,

4
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:10.912
I asked him if we could switch topics at the last moment

5
00:00:10.912 --> 00:00:13.271
and speak to the reemergence of the feminine.

6
00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:15.611
He kindly obliged and we took a deep look

7
00:00:15.611 --> 00:00:17.861
at the suppression of women throughout history

8
00:00:17.861 --> 00:00:20.272
and the need for the feminine to come to the forefront,

9
00:00:20.272 --> 00:00:22.582
again, for the sake of humanity.

10
00:00:22.912 --> 00:00:24.542
(mellow Celtic music)

11
00:00:32.012 --> 00:00:35.282
Micheal since we last talked I found it rather interesting,

12
00:00:35.282 --> 00:00:36.672
in that a lot of the women,

13
00:00:36.672 --> 00:00:38.552
a lot of them are very outspoken,

14
00:00:38.552 --> 00:00:40.552
some of them are, more or less, well known

15
00:00:40.552 --> 00:00:42.372
in the alternative media,

16
00:00:42.372 --> 00:00:43.712
including friends of mine and myself

17
00:00:43.712 --> 00:00:45.892
are having this experience that something

18
00:00:45.892 --> 00:00:49.463
of a very deep and moving nature seems to be surfacing

19
00:00:49.463 --> 00:00:52.802
and it's taking the shape of a type of anger.

20
00:00:53.012 --> 00:00:56.372
I'm realizing it's from a collective connection

21
00:00:56.372 --> 00:01:00.282
to a larger consciousness, a memory if you will,

22
00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:03.913
not that there's not every good reason

23
00:01:03.913 --> 00:01:08.142
for women to have some of this bubbling to the surface

24
00:01:08.742 --> 00:01:12.012
but there's been a, in your work, a concerted effort

25
00:01:12.012 --> 00:01:13.652
to make sure that women in particular,

26
00:01:13.652 --> 00:01:15.882
stay particularly asleep.

27
00:01:16.372 --> 00:01:18.012
Can you talk to us just a little bit about,

28
00:01:18.012 --> 00:01:19.873
even from an ocultist point of view

29
00:01:19.873 --> 00:01:21.992
and some of what goes on in the darkest reaches

30
00:01:21.992 --> 00:01:24.142
that most of us don't have awareness of?

31
00:01:24.352 --> 00:01:26.312
<v ->Well, women have been suppressed in hundreds of ways</v>

32
00:01:26.312 --> 00:01:28.112
for years and that suppression

33
00:01:28.112 --> 00:01:31.932
is not just a physical oppression from outside,

34
00:01:31.932 --> 00:01:35.292
it's the implanting of inferior idioms

35
00:01:35.292 --> 00:01:37.782
within the consciousness of the female.

36
00:01:37.812 --> 00:01:41.712
It also is a misrepresentation of what is femininity,

37
00:01:42.522 --> 00:01:44.832
in general, we may not even have a clear understanding

38
00:01:44.832 --> 00:01:47.092
of what femininity and masculinity are

39
00:01:47.712 --> 00:01:50.292
because a lot of people don't realize

40
00:01:50.292 --> 00:01:52.552
there's a huge difference between what is male and female

41
00:01:52.552 --> 00:01:53.732
and masculine, feminine

42
00:01:53.732 --> 00:01:55.712
and will use those terms interchangeably

43
00:01:55.712 --> 00:01:57.192
which is okay on a street level

44
00:01:57.192 --> 00:01:58.692
but when you're trying to be more,

45
00:01:58.692 --> 00:02:00.233
you know technical about it,

46
00:02:00.233 --> 00:02:01.932
you get into all sorts of problems.

47
00:02:01.932 --> 00:02:03.512
This is actually a huge thing that I hope

48
00:02:03.512 --> 00:02:05.012
that people will think about it

49
00:02:05.012 --> 00:02:07.192
because, in fact, what you're seeing in the world today

50
00:02:07.192 --> 00:02:09.052
are basically people who have murdered

51
00:02:09.052 --> 00:02:11.472
their own femininity and masculinity,

52
00:02:12.642 --> 00:02:16.733
make up for that fact by the cosmetic industry

53
00:02:16.733 --> 00:02:21.322
who provides simulacras, false personas of masculinity

54
00:02:21.472 --> 00:02:23.572
and femininity as they have contrived it.

55
00:02:23.572 --> 00:02:25.112
People conform to those models

56
00:02:25.112 --> 00:02:26.832
and this is what we have now walking about

57
00:02:26.832 --> 00:02:28.382
in society.

58
00:02:28.712 --> 00:02:30.052
So very few people today

59
00:02:30.932 --> 00:02:34.662
have a good sense of their own masculinity and femininity.

60
00:02:34.953 --> 00:02:36.472
You're speaking specifically about women

61
00:02:36.472 --> 00:02:37.852
and that's where I would come in

62
00:02:37.852 --> 00:02:40.543
is that women, today, have lost all sense

63
00:02:40.543 --> 00:02:42.222
of what it is to be feminine.

64
00:02:43.032 --> 00:02:44.852
Because in order to even be able

65
00:02:44.852 --> 00:02:47.772
to coexist in the world, gain success,

66
00:02:48.572 --> 00:02:50.182
they've had to become masculinized.

67
00:02:50.372 --> 00:02:52.642
It's been demanded, it may be unspoken,

68
00:02:52.642 --> 00:02:54.173
meaning that persons parents may not sit down

69
00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:56.744
and give this as a lecture to the average teenage girl,

70
00:02:57.033 --> 00:03:01.703
but society is permeated with that,

71
00:03:02.274 --> 00:03:04.794
that unless you suit up like a guy

72
00:03:05.724 --> 00:03:09.504
unless you cosmetize yourself according to certain models,

73
00:03:10.475 --> 00:03:12.084
that they put on television,

74
00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:14.114
unless you have completely beaten yourself up

75
00:03:14.114 --> 00:03:15.814
about your looks, about your complexion,

76
00:03:15.814 --> 00:03:17.795
about your height, about your level of intelligence,

77
00:03:17.795 --> 00:03:22.584
about your applicability, your intelligence level,

78
00:03:23.414 --> 00:03:25.404
your levels of approval

79
00:03:26.154 --> 00:03:27.734
and so now you have girls

80
00:03:27.734 --> 00:03:31.164
who are entirely fixated on winning that approval.

81
00:03:31.714 --> 00:03:33.154
But of course what happens in society

82
00:03:33.154 --> 00:03:34.754
is we often may want something,

83
00:03:34.754 --> 00:03:36.964
we may have expectations, we may not get it.

84
00:03:36.975 --> 00:03:38.534
So what happens to these adolescents

85
00:03:38.534 --> 00:03:41.624
is that they then jump through all these hoops,

86
00:03:41.624 --> 00:03:43.054
force their parents to buy them things,

87
00:03:43.054 --> 00:03:44.915
conform to what their peer groups are talking about,

88
00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:47.795
and micro-analyze all the media out there

89
00:03:47.795 --> 00:03:50.754
in order to fit these preposterous stereotypes

90
00:03:51.934 --> 00:03:53.555
and then not get the very approval

91
00:03:53.555 --> 00:03:56.275
from a pyschopathic, broken society

92
00:03:56.575 --> 00:03:58.324
that was the promissory note.

93
00:03:58.534 --> 00:03:59.774
<v Voiceover>But isn't it designed to make sure</v>

94
00:03:59.774 --> 00:04:01.274
that that approval is never given.

95
00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:03.334
<v ->Yes it is and that is the crux of the then</v>

96
00:04:03.334 --> 00:04:04.494
where the neurosis comes in,

97
00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:05.884
because when we don't get the approval

98
00:04:05.884 --> 00:04:07.144
that we falsely need,

99
00:04:07.144 --> 00:04:09.214
I mean my work ultimately works on why

100
00:04:09.214 --> 00:04:10.754
we would even need that approval,

101
00:04:10.754 --> 00:04:12.654
but that's another area.

102
00:04:12.654 --> 00:04:13.514
Since you do need it,

103
00:04:13.514 --> 00:04:15.775
since you're whole psychology

104
00:04:15.775 --> 00:04:19.034
is geared towards receiving it, you will do two things.

105
00:04:19.034 --> 00:04:22.924
One, you will do anything, including self-murder, to get it.

106
00:04:23.554 --> 00:04:27.774
You'll become a completely acculturated person

107
00:04:27.774 --> 00:04:29.734
because you feel that I will get it

108
00:04:29.734 --> 00:04:30.974
if I jump through these hoops,

109
00:04:30.974 --> 00:04:32.234
if I look like the latest model,

110
00:04:32.234 --> 00:04:35.934
if my speech is, you know,

111
00:04:36.824 --> 00:04:40.054
the way that I speak is born from television lingo,

112
00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:44.225
if I mimic and if I conform.

113
00:04:44.314 --> 00:04:45.334
The other thing is then

114
00:04:45.334 --> 00:04:47.034
when you find out that you're not getting the approval

115
00:04:47.034 --> 00:04:48.934
then comes the inevitable neuroses

116
00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:52.434
and it's at this point, when the neurosis sets in

117
00:04:52.694 --> 00:04:55.604
that big brother is watching.

118
00:04:55.954 --> 00:04:57.434
This is what big brother's hoping for,

119
00:04:57.434 --> 00:04:58.935
he's not really empowered

120
00:04:58.935 --> 00:05:00.754
while you're going through the early stages.

121
00:05:00.754 --> 00:05:03.334
He is empowered when you start becoming neurotic,

122
00:05:03.334 --> 00:05:05.054
because the neurotic individual

123
00:05:05.054 --> 00:05:07.074
is far more susceptible to control.

124
00:05:07.884 --> 00:05:09.814
This affects women more than men

125
00:05:09.814 --> 00:05:11.134
because men, historically,

126
00:05:11.134 --> 00:05:13.714
have been able to out project or project their anger,

127
00:05:13.714 --> 00:05:15.894
because you were talking about anger

128
00:05:15.894 --> 00:05:18.404
and this is all satellite to these emotions.

129
00:05:19.074 --> 00:05:20.854
Men have been able to bounce a basketball,

130
00:05:21.544 --> 00:05:24.294
kick a football around, have a bar fight,

131
00:05:25.754 --> 00:05:29.784
go hunting, go off to war if necessary,

132
00:05:31.135 --> 00:05:34.734
kill entire peoples and all the rest of it

133
00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:38.554
in order to exercise and expatiate

134
00:05:38.554 --> 00:05:41.144
all of this pent up emotion and anger and so on.

135
00:05:41.254 --> 00:05:42.535
The difference is that women

136
00:05:42.535 --> 00:05:44.134
have not been allowed to do that, historically.

137
00:05:44.134 --> 00:05:47.534
They introject, of course now the introjection

138
00:05:47.534 --> 00:05:51.074
plays in yet to another leviathan

139
00:05:51.074 --> 00:05:52.674
which is the big pharma,

140
00:05:52.674 --> 00:05:54.254
because when you introject anger

141
00:05:54.254 --> 00:05:56.644
you have skin breakouts, you have bad eyesight,

142
00:05:56.714 --> 00:05:59.004
you will have a whole cocktail of other,

143
00:05:59.004 --> 00:06:01.714
mostly biological issues, including anorexia by the way

144
00:06:01.714 --> 00:06:04.355
which is self hatred, expressed outwardly, or bulemia

145
00:06:04.355 --> 00:06:06.364
and all the other cocktail.

146
00:06:06.534 --> 00:06:07.954
<v Voiceover>It's a slow suicide of sorts.</v>

147
00:06:07.954 --> 00:06:09.395
<v ->Well it is, ultimately.</v>

148
00:06:09.395 --> 00:06:11.835
Then what happens is big brother's watching

149
00:06:11.835 --> 00:06:14.856
because he knows that most women, up until now,

150
00:06:14.856 --> 00:06:16.655
which brings us to your point

151
00:06:16.655 --> 00:06:18.685
have always been introjecting,

152
00:06:19.015 --> 00:06:20.395
but as Freud and Jung always said,

153
00:06:20.395 --> 00:06:22.286
you can only repress to a certain extent.

154
00:06:22.555 --> 00:06:24.495
You can only introject to a certain extent

155
00:06:24.495 --> 00:06:26.275
until the sump gets completely full

156
00:06:26.275 --> 00:06:28.267
then it's gonna explode outwardly.

157
00:06:28.815 --> 00:06:30.555
Which I don't believe is entirely a bad thing

158
00:06:30.555 --> 00:06:33.355
because of all pathologies, one is just replacing the other

159
00:06:33.355 --> 00:06:34.995
or one is slightly less bad than the other,

160
00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:36.685
you see it's all a matter of scale.

161
00:06:36.955 --> 00:06:38.695
The thing is though, if women as you were saying,

162
00:06:38.695 --> 00:06:41.135
are starting to get either over,

163
00:06:42.325 --> 00:06:46.105
the introjection is reaching it's end.

164
00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:47.956
There's only one avenue left

165
00:06:47.956 --> 00:06:50.425
and that is to start projecting.

166
00:06:50.515 --> 00:06:52.555
I'm in favor of all emotions being accepted

167
00:06:53.225 --> 00:06:56.855
and being, because I advocate healthy relationships

168
00:06:56.855 --> 00:06:59.735
with what are mistakenly called darker emotions.

169
00:06:59.735 --> 00:07:01.795
They're only darker because you won't look at them,

170
00:07:01.795 --> 00:07:03.735
you won't shine the light of consciousness onto them.

171
00:07:03.735 --> 00:07:05.096
Now, there's a problem because if women

172
00:07:05.096 --> 00:07:08.495
don't know how to healthily project their anger

173
00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:10.266
and these fantastic emotions--

174
00:07:10.266 --> 00:07:11.466
<v Voiceover>Which they don't.</v>

175
00:07:11.466 --> 00:07:12.946
<v ->Which they don't, which is critical,</v>

176
00:07:12.946 --> 00:07:14.486
into art, into ascetics, into sport,

177
00:07:14.486 --> 00:07:16.766
into something that's building them up

178
00:07:16.766 --> 00:07:20.366
by bringing them in touch with their own creativity.

179
00:07:20.476 --> 00:07:22.726
Then of course they will,

180
00:07:22.726 --> 00:07:24.527
another form of neurosis,

181
00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:26.467
another form of pathology will be created

182
00:07:26.467 --> 00:07:28.756
in which it might be dysfunctionally projected.

183
00:07:28.927 --> 00:07:30.246
This has implications for children,

184
00:07:30.246 --> 00:07:33.066
this has implications for just driving down the freeway,

185
00:07:33.066 --> 00:07:36.356
more road rage, you know it has a sociological implications.

186
00:07:36.866 --> 00:07:38.086
But then we have to look at

187
00:07:38.086 --> 00:07:39.766
is why is a sea-change happening?

188
00:07:39.766 --> 00:07:41.976
There's deeper questions in all of this,

189
00:07:42.008 --> 00:07:44.326
it's very good, I always advocate in my work

190
00:07:44.326 --> 00:07:45.806
you shouldn't be okay with injustice,

191
00:07:45.806 --> 00:07:48.126
you shouldn't be smiling depressively,

192
00:07:48.126 --> 00:07:49.958
if you see things that are broken and corrupt

193
00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.566
you should rebel against it.

194
00:07:51.566 --> 00:07:52.706
So if that's what's happening

195
00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:54.186
and there's this outpouring of emotion

196
00:07:54.186 --> 00:07:55.786
because people are now sick of the cosmetics,

197
00:07:55.786 --> 00:07:57.126
the girls are waking up to realize,

198
00:07:57.126 --> 00:07:58.486
I'm not gonna conform, it's no good,

199
00:07:58.486 --> 00:07:59.546
I want to be me.

200
00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:01.486
Who am I, I don't want to conform to all my peer groups,

201
00:08:01.486 --> 00:08:02.966
I'm not interested in what the media

202
00:08:02.966 --> 00:08:06.077
is broadcasting, I sense that it's rotten.

203
00:08:06.077 --> 00:08:10.517
Then if they don't have the bridge to move it over,

204
00:08:11.147 --> 00:08:12.987
unfortunately there's always a grey area

205
00:08:12.987 --> 00:08:14.797
between a period of change

206
00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:16.417
and this is very difficult.

207
00:08:16.417 --> 00:08:18.047
In fact, we're finding it in a broader context,

208
00:08:18.047 --> 00:08:20.648
and I talk about this in my work on 2012,

209
00:08:20.648 --> 00:08:24.688
is that in this 13 year countdown cycle to the date of 2012,

210
00:08:25.598 --> 00:08:27.168
where there's a massive shift taking place

211
00:08:27.168 --> 00:08:28.549
from what might be described,

212
00:08:28.549 --> 00:08:30.968
if you'll permit me to astrological jargon,

213
00:08:30.968 --> 00:08:33.448
from a saturnian, masculine, patriarchal,

214
00:08:33.448 --> 00:08:36.098
phallocratic modality

215
00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:39.238
into the more uranian, piscean plutonic.

216
00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:44.968
People who are under the saturnian martian solar paradigm

217
00:08:44.968 --> 00:08:46.979
can't just change overnight

218
00:08:46.988 --> 00:08:49.568
any more than anyone who says anything can change overnight.

219
00:08:49.568 --> 00:08:51.748
So what the person has to deal with,

220
00:08:51.748 --> 00:08:53.209
what the addict has to deal with

221
00:08:53.209 --> 00:08:56.299
is this grey area which is extremely uncanny

222
00:08:56.299 --> 00:08:57.858
and very disconcerting

223
00:08:57.858 --> 00:09:00.399
and we don't have any models in our world for that.

224
00:09:00.529 --> 00:09:01.650
Shamanic traditions do,

225
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:02.908
they'll guide you through it,

226
00:09:02.908 --> 00:09:04.508
they tell you about the wasteland, the wilderness,

227
00:09:04.508 --> 00:09:05.969
Moses going through the desert,

228
00:09:05.969 --> 00:09:08.058
Theseus going into the underworld,

229
00:09:08.378 --> 00:09:10.798
King Arthur when the grail is missing,

230
00:09:10.808 --> 00:09:13.818
the whole land dies and turns to snow

231
00:09:13.888 --> 00:09:15.708
and the knights lose their power and their potency

232
00:09:15.708 --> 00:09:17.288
or Sampson losing his hair.

233
00:09:17.288 --> 00:09:19.568
There's this grey area that's known in the mythos,

234
00:09:19.568 --> 00:09:22.390
known in the fiction, but we don't know anything about it

235
00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.818
in this fast paced, hypermanic world.

236
00:09:24.908 --> 00:09:26.948
So my message is be okay with emotions,

237
00:09:26.948 --> 00:09:28.769
be okay with coming out,

238
00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:31.138
realize it's a healing process

239
00:09:31.388 --> 00:09:32.929
but watch out for that grey area

240
00:09:32.929 --> 00:09:34.808
where you don't know how to let go

241
00:09:34.808 --> 00:09:37.259
of the martian, solar, saturnian

242
00:09:37.259 --> 00:09:39.088
and wait to be guided

243
00:09:39.088 --> 00:09:41.329
to show you how to adopt that new modality.

244
00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:42.388
<v Voiceover>Because a lot of women</v>

245
00:09:42.388 --> 00:09:44.278
are being drugged right now,

246
00:09:44.728 --> 00:09:48.228
that is the opiate, it's psychoactive drugs.

247
00:09:48.228 --> 00:09:49.608
<v ->Yeah, and of course</v>

248
00:09:49.608 --> 00:09:51.708
if you don't mind me saying it,

249
00:09:51.708 --> 00:09:54.338
it is also very much part of what religion has done,

250
00:09:54.338 --> 00:09:57.068
because we have to learn how to identify the very forces

251
00:09:57.068 --> 00:09:58.469
that have kept both men and women

252
00:09:58.469 --> 00:10:00.258
in this polarized state.

253
00:10:00.588 --> 00:10:03.491
All religion is based on very powerful motifs,

254
00:10:03.491 --> 00:10:05.568
for instance to cut a long story short,

255
00:10:05.568 --> 00:10:07.178
the chemical wedding.

256
00:10:07.568 --> 00:10:09.548
The supreme androgyny of the nucleaction

257
00:10:09.548 --> 00:10:11.428
of both masculine and feminine,

258
00:10:11.428 --> 00:10:13.288
not male and female, those are stereotypes,

259
00:10:13.288 --> 00:10:15.108
those are biology.

260
00:10:15.378 --> 00:10:18.358
But each individual, every man carries within him a woman,

261
00:10:19.428 --> 00:10:21.698
this was shown beautifully in the movie Life Force.

262
00:10:21.908 --> 00:10:24.208
There's an image of the perfect woman within our minds.

263
00:10:24.208 --> 00:10:25.388
In fact in Celtic mythology,

264
00:10:25.388 --> 00:10:27.388
or I should say more correctly Irish mythology,

265
00:10:27.388 --> 00:10:30.628
they personify those archetypes as literally Goddesses.

266
00:10:30.628 --> 00:10:32.068
They represent the land and the sky

267
00:10:32.068 --> 00:10:33.928
but they also represent a part of a man

268
00:10:33.928 --> 00:10:35.408
that he has to unite with.

269
00:10:35.408 --> 00:10:37.588
This is why the hair was long, kings wore long hair,

270
00:10:37.588 --> 00:10:39.328
the pharaohs wore their lapels long,

271
00:10:39.328 --> 00:10:41.990
the Merovingians wore the mane of the lion,

272
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.028
partly because it was a sign of kingship,

273
00:10:44.028 --> 00:10:45.688
but partly because it identified you

274
00:10:45.688 --> 00:10:47.268
with the feminine principle.

275
00:10:47.268 --> 00:10:49.048
The Native American Indians go through the sun dance

276
00:10:49.048 --> 00:10:50.188
and other rituals, why?

277
00:10:50.188 --> 00:10:51.768
To suffer pain that the woman experiences

278
00:10:51.768 --> 00:10:53.378
when giving birth.

279
00:10:53.428 --> 00:10:55.268
So these rites and rituals are to help you,

280
00:10:55.268 --> 00:10:58.910
not only deconstruct the hard in femininity,

281
00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:00.308
the hard in masculinity,

282
00:11:00.308 --> 00:11:02.658
so that the real chemical wedding can take place.

283
00:11:02.948 --> 00:11:04.728
Christianity and Judaism and Islam

284
00:11:04.728 --> 00:11:06.888
and all these religions co-opted this,

285
00:11:07.948 --> 00:11:11.908
skewed it so that they then have this marriage ritual,

286
00:11:11.908 --> 00:11:12.879
physical marriage ritual

287
00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:16.309
which is an entire parody of the chemical wedding,

288
00:11:16.819 --> 00:11:18.079
but they sell it to you,

289
00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:20.009
basically in a glorified slavery way--

290
00:11:20.059 --> 00:11:21.479
<v Voiceover>Uh-huh, white fluffy dresses.</v>

291
00:11:21.479 --> 00:11:23.219
<v ->Yes, and their dresses, their costumes or their regalia,</v>

292
00:11:23.219 --> 00:11:25.079
the designs of the churches, the salt water,

293
00:11:25.079 --> 00:11:26.509
all of that stuff.

294
00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:28.919
Then you step down a level

295
00:11:28.919 --> 00:11:31.760
and you find that the entire corporate advertising world,

296
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.399
the world of the merchant, the mercantile people,

297
00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:35.990
have done the same thing.

298
00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:37.959
I was showing examples of this in the talk,

299
00:11:37.959 --> 00:11:41.760
you know of how the male and female's portrayed

300
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.589
in the movies and also in advertisements.

301
00:11:44.619 --> 00:11:46.500
But what's really being talked about there,

302
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.619
are not these inane stereotypes but what's behind it,

303
00:11:50.259 --> 00:11:52.429
the archetypes of the masculine and the feminine.

304
00:11:52.641 --> 00:11:54.599
Because the last thing that these people want

305
00:11:54.599 --> 00:11:56.539
is for a person to start doing that holy work.

306
00:11:56.539 --> 00:11:58.299
Because the moment that you're taught how

307
00:11:58.299 --> 00:11:59.819
to do it yourself, you dispense with religions,

308
00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:01.039
you don't need them anymore

309
00:12:01.039 --> 00:12:03.079
because you realize you are the temple of the truth

310
00:12:03.079 --> 00:12:05.329
or the temple of all of God.

311
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.829
Another way to look at this problem

312
00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:12.639
is to ask the question, what was the woman's duty

313
00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:14.739
before the whole thing got skewed?

314
00:12:14.739 --> 00:12:18.069
Before she had to conform to these role models

315
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:19.889
to succeed in the saturnian system.

316
00:12:21.579 --> 00:12:22.819
In fact one guy brought--

317
00:12:22.819 --> 00:12:24.219
pull out again and say,

318
00:12:24.219 --> 00:12:27.719
what was mankind, all of humankind's job?

319
00:12:27.719 --> 00:12:31.539
if this road, this diversion, into technology

320
00:12:31.539 --> 00:12:34.779
and anti-natural thought pattterns

321
00:12:34.779 --> 00:12:37.749
and self-less, you know this collectivism,

322
00:12:37.899 --> 00:12:39.799
say all those pernicious things that we should know about

323
00:12:39.799 --> 00:12:42.029
are pernicious, they're false.

324
00:12:42.119 --> 00:12:43.439
The question is always then,

325
00:12:43.439 --> 00:12:45.279
what is man meant to be doing,

326
00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:47.040
what is women really meant to be doing?

327
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.530
That question is much easier to answer

328
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.361
if you examine women.

329
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.310
It's much harder to say what a man's real job is,

330
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:57.260
if he's not Arnold Schwarzenegger or Ronald Reagan.

331
00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.860
If he's not a scientist and a sort of like a hunter--

332
00:13:00.891 --> 00:13:02.750
<v Voiceover>If he doesn't have a business card.</v>

333
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.270
<v ->He's not bringing home the meat,</v>

334
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:05.810
I can't think of what he must be doing.

335
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.710
What, sitting under a mushroom and meditating,

336
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.270
like a Taoist, see we lose it.

337
00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.690
However, we obviously know from anthropologists

338
00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.530
that the female were the keepers of the wisdom,

339
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.310
we know this from Marija Gimbutas

340
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.660
and so many other great scholars.

341
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.370
So in other words what's happening,

342
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:21.670
how does this tie into the phenomenon

343
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.050
you're speaking of in the modern world,

344
00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:27.130
because this plutonic, or let's say countdown to 2012,

345
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:28.613
whatever tradition you're coming from

346
00:13:28.613 --> 00:13:30.130
has different languaging for all of this,

347
00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.710
what happens if this expatiation of the anger

348
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.390
and this outpouring, is a cleansing process

349
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.350
to get that holy grail, the female,

350
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:42.610
back into her femininity, not as when we had feminism

351
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:44.650
as a rebellion against the male,

352
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:47.710
but an integration with a higher form of femininity

353
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.700
which ultimately is a unification with the masculine.

354
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.050
See a spiritual move, I believe that's happening.

355
00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:54.410
These changes are plutonic

356
00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:56.930
and Pluto always goes to the deepest recesses of the being

357
00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:58.510
to find what's there, what's growing there.

358
00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:02.391
Whatever rank weeds and whatever is not sustainable

359
00:14:02.391 --> 00:14:05.971
it will extract it, clean it off and find what's precious

360
00:14:05.971 --> 00:14:07.680
and replant that.

361
00:14:07.711 --> 00:14:09.170
<v Voiceover>So that's really the good news about this,</v>

362
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.830
particular, astrological cycle.

363
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:11.951
<v ->If people get with it,</v>

364
00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:13.750
if people get with it on a mental level,

365
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.710
otherwise they're in that grey area we talked about

366
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:16.950
and they'll get traumatized

367
00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:18.490
and then miss out on the guidance.

368
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.870
<v Voiceover>One of the ways</v>

369
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.170
in which this is showing itself among young girls,

370
00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.070
is an extreme rebellion, as you were saying,

371
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:27.430
against the advertising

372
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:29.170
and backlash against the advertising industry

373
00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.110
and the brainwashing to be the superficial feminine,

374
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:37.110
right down to becoming as masculinized as any man.

375
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.010
One of the phenomenon that is happening

376
00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:41.810
even on YouTube is girl fighting,

377
00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:43.130
I mean rough, tough,

378
00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:45.701
punching each other in the face, girl fighting.

379
00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:50.390
I mean this is obviously a somewhat distorted backlash

380
00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.930
to the phenomenon that you're talking about, but--

381
00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.310
<v ->Big brother knows that this is gonna happen,</v>

382
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:56.630
they have their fingers on the pulse

383
00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.230
of all of these psychic dynamics.

384
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.850
They're ready to create another arena,

385
00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.610
so that you could divert it, you know they go

386
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.930
"Over here, this is the way you can handle it."

387
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.490
This happened even when women were forced to wear pants

388
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:08.910
and there's good parts and bad.

389
00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:11.993
But even the cosmetics, about getting women away

390
00:15:11.993 --> 00:15:14.070
from a healthy sense of masculinity.

391
00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:17.090
Then feminism, most of the feminists were Fabians,

392
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.530
funded and paid to distort femininity in another way,

393
00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:22.710
with the promise that we're introducing you to it.

394
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.930
It was just man-hate under another guise.

395
00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.910
<v Voiceover>Ann Russo said it was essentially created,</v>

396
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.490
it was a Rockefeller agenda

397
00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.570
to create more people onto the tax roles,

398
00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:32.850
get the women working.

399
00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.250
<v ->Yeah, Kate Millet was an absolute bonafide psychotic.</v>

400
00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:36.850
she spent time in a lunatic asylum

401
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.390
and stuff like that, yeah.

402
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:40.940
She was easily, easily manipulated

403
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.950
into doing what they wanted.

404
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.970
<v Voiceover>There's something else that comes in</v>

405
00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.810
about, this would have been in the mid 1960s,

406
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.970
when some of this was starting to take seed,

407
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:52.110
one of the things I've thought of many times

408
00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:53.810
and you and I talked about this off-camera,

409
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.390
which is really appalling,

410
00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:56.790
is the new Levi's ad.

411
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.990
But let's go back to when Levis really caught on

412
00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:01.170
because I was a young girl in the United States

413
00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:02.610
at that time and I remember

414
00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:06.310
exactly when myself and my pod, we were identical

415
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:09.011
all started wearing Levis at the same time.

416
00:16:09.011 --> 00:16:11.690
This would have been around 1963, 1964,

417
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.850
at the same time there was an agenda

418
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.170
that was uncovered that another person gave me

419
00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:19.390
that was a matter, it's in the congressional record,

420
00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:24.070
about the larger, essentially, Marxist agenda

421
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.170
that was going to be foisted upon the American people,

422
00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:29.150
almost every point of which has already taken place by now.

423
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:33.270
This whole thing about Levis, Levi,

424
00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.010
this utilitarian type of clothing

425
00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.090
that we're all to stuff ourselves in

426
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.210
and do up to this very day,

427
00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:41.170
right down to the iconography

428
00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.830
and the most recent advertisement by Levi.

429
00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:45.510
Can you talk about your perceptions

430
00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:48.770
of what this utilitarian blue cloth means

431
00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:51.110
to us as feminine and masculine?

432
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.630
<v ->Well, it sends a message on one level</v>

433
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:58.410
that don't be showy,

434
00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:00.230
dress down, be normal,

435
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:01.740
this kind of idea.

436
00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.830
But like in anything, it's not so much the product,

437
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.710
the product may be good, it may be bad,

438
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.170
it may be meaningless.

439
00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:08.430
My interest is always

440
00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.210
is that this commercial advertising shell

441
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:13.390
that sells anything, be it toothpaste or soap or jeans.

442
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.610
I'm worried about the name Levi

443
00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:17.030
cause I know where that word comes from.

444
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.130
I haven't looked into it,

445
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:20.130
it may be a legitimate name, Levi Strauss,

446
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.130
but the fact that it became a corporate logo

447
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:25.160
sets it into another field of analysis.

448
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.190
<v Voiceover>Tell us about that.</v>

449
00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:28.430
<v ->Well, Levite.</v>

450
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:29.750
<v Voiceover>Levite?</v>

451
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.790
<v ->It's old testament, 501 is Gematria for phallus,</v>

452
00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:34.300
for penis.

453
00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:35.930
Most famous jeans of Levi's 501--

454
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:36.830
<v Voiceover>Really?</v>

455
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:38.130
I should know that, I'd never heard that till now.

456
00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:40.710
<v ->Yeah, 501 is Gematria, Hebrew Gematria for the phallus.</v>

457
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:41.810
<v Voiceover>That's what I started wearing,</v>

458
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:43.110
everyone wore 501s.

459
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:45.380
<v ->Because the woman is being conformed to act like a man.</v>

460
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.110
<v Voiceover>The flesh of the woman is also,</v>

461
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.690
at this time, being constricted in very harsh cloth

462
00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:53.330
and covered which is really antithetical to our skin.

463
00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:54.310
<v ->That's right.</v>

464
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:55.730
But remember they also think of,

465
00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:57.730
phallic, you can have a word phallic,

466
00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.490
which is referring to the genitals themselves

467
00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:00.950
and then you have ithyphallic,

468
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:02.720
which means any phallic looking thing.

469
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.900
But any phallic looking thing like a monument

470
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.870
or the human body.

471
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.050
The human body is ithyphallic

472
00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:14.110
so the clothes that then clothe that body

473
00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:17.600
are either gonna be a surrogate feminine symbol

474
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.110
which is why the popes and the cardinals

475
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.130
wear the feminine robes, it's tied into the same thing

476
00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:22.810
or in daily secular life,

477
00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.790
you'll see them trying to stuff us into Levi jeans,

478
00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:26.351
where women are making that attractive

479
00:18:26.351 --> 00:18:29.331
and all the men in those ads are actually androgynous men,

480
00:18:29.331 --> 00:18:31.131
they may look hard-bodied, actually,

481
00:18:31.131 --> 00:18:33.211
but they're not, as a matter of fact.

482
00:18:33.211 --> 00:18:35.491
The women in the advertisements

483
00:18:35.491 --> 00:18:38.431
watching the guy wash his Levis,

484
00:18:38.431 --> 00:18:40.391
if you look at the way they filmed that,

485
00:18:40.391 --> 00:18:41.851
they're actually having these girls,

486
00:18:41.851 --> 00:18:44.481
really, look into a mirror of who they'd like to be.

487
00:18:44.971 --> 00:18:45.891
It's not a real male,

488
00:18:45.891 --> 00:18:47.681
it's a image of a male in a girl's mind,

489
00:18:48.111 --> 00:18:50.141
so we're into the realm of psychology, you see?

490
00:18:50.351 --> 00:18:52.331
<v Voiceover>Yes, it's very androgynous,</v>

491
00:18:52.331 --> 00:18:53.311
<v ->It's very deep.</v>

492
00:18:53.311 --> 00:18:54.971
<v Voiceover>The latest ads are extremely androgynous.</v>

493
00:18:54.971 --> 00:18:56.211
<v ->Sure they are, sure they are.</v>

494
00:18:56.211 --> 00:18:57.731
<v Voiceover>And there is the push towards violence,</v>

495
00:18:57.731 --> 00:19:00.451
there's the half-sunken, half-submerged sign,

496
00:19:00.451 --> 00:19:03.031
America blinking in and out, a neon sign.

497
00:19:03.031 --> 00:19:04.791
I don't know if you've seen this one

498
00:19:04.791 --> 00:19:09.791
with Walter, famous, famous poet, rebel poet,

499
00:19:11.431 --> 00:19:13.731
Walt Whitman supposedly an old--

500
00:19:13.731 --> 00:19:14.831
<v ->I have seen it.</v>

501
00:19:14.831 --> 00:19:16.331
<v Voiceover>Supposedly an old wax seal of his voice.</v>

502
00:19:16.331 --> 00:19:17.631
<v ->America, and it's always black and white,</v>

503
00:19:17.631 --> 00:19:18.871
yeah, God what a horrible,

504
00:19:18.871 --> 00:19:20.151
how dare they even use that man's poetry

505
00:19:20.151 --> 00:19:21.911
in that context, but don't even get me started--

506
00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:23.472
<v Voiceover>Oh, he's gotta be rolling over--</v>

507
00:19:23.472 --> 00:19:24.471
(laughing)

508
00:19:24.471 --> 00:19:25.831
<v ->But don't even get me started on how they use</v>

509
00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:27.591
not only a false nostalgic, pseudo nostalgic,

510
00:19:27.591 --> 00:19:30.432
Speilburgesque, black and white images

511
00:19:30.432 --> 00:19:33.321
of a golden, glowing America which never existed.

512
00:19:33.811 --> 00:19:35.711
Don't get me started on how they use classical music

513
00:19:35.711 --> 00:19:38.751
and debauch it to sell silver toothpaste, or some nonsense.

514
00:19:39.241 --> 00:19:42.221
How they use femininity, decapitated women,

515
00:19:42.221 --> 00:19:45.131
animals, nature, the rest of it,

516
00:19:45.131 --> 00:19:47.331
glorified images of grandparents sucking toffees

517
00:19:47.331 --> 00:19:49.111
with a little kid in the rocking chair.

518
00:19:49.111 --> 00:19:50.791
Did this ever happen?

519
00:19:50.791 --> 00:19:52.551
Are we in the world of the living and the sane?

520
00:19:52.551 --> 00:19:54.751
No, we're in the realm of Hollywood and Madison Avenue.

521
00:19:54.751 --> 00:19:57.811
Why do think in Spielberg's,

522
00:19:57.811 --> 00:20:01.251
in umpteen movies that he's made, keeps referring,

523
00:20:01.251 --> 00:20:04.272
not only, to these fake nostalgic images of the past,

524
00:20:04.272 --> 00:20:06.291
like he does constantly in Indiana Jones

525
00:20:06.291 --> 00:20:08.151
and even in other films that he's done,

526
00:20:08.151 --> 00:20:10.011
he's retro, he's very retro in his movies.

527
00:20:10.011 --> 00:20:13.991
He will even have images in his movies of other movies.

528
00:20:13.991 --> 00:20:16.951
In Indiana Jones and the Chrystal Skulls

529
00:20:16.951 --> 00:20:20.601
his partner turns up on a Harley dressed like Marlon Brando.

530
00:20:20.891 --> 00:20:22.091
Does anybody notice

531
00:20:22.091 --> 00:20:23.811
what is going on in this ridiculous thing?

532
00:20:23.811 --> 00:20:26.591
I saw another movie, I think it was Demolition Man,

533
00:20:26.591 --> 00:20:29.131
in which the female cop, lieutenant,

534
00:20:29.131 --> 00:20:31.691
they're all retro because they're so future,

535
00:20:31.691 --> 00:20:33.172
that they have the quaint,

536
00:20:33.172 --> 00:20:35.031
they listen to the little jingles on the radio,

537
00:20:35.031 --> 00:20:36.551
it's an interesting film

538
00:20:36.551 --> 00:20:39.861
and they have these quaint, romantic interests in the past.

539
00:20:40.171 --> 00:20:41.751
But, actually, on a sub-textural level,

540
00:20:41.751 --> 00:20:45.071
when she takes the Sylvester Stallone character

541
00:20:45.071 --> 00:20:47.811
into her office while they're looking on the computer

542
00:20:47.811 --> 00:20:52.161
or something, in the background are posters of Die Hard.

543
00:20:53.361 --> 00:20:56.202
In that same movie, Demolition Man,

544
00:20:56.202 --> 00:20:58.302
when Sylvester Stallone character

545
00:20:58.302 --> 00:21:01.402
and the lady cop are driving in her car, she says

546
00:21:01.402 --> 00:21:04.262
that in the past Arnold Schwarzenegger became the president

547
00:21:04.262 --> 00:21:06.082
and they have this little weird scene

548
00:21:06.082 --> 00:21:07.302
about you're kidding me.

549
00:21:07.302 --> 00:21:10.262
So again another "in" movie reference in a movie

550
00:21:10.262 --> 00:21:12.893
and people think that's Hollywood, that's cool.

551
00:21:12.982 --> 00:21:15.002
No, it's not, that is saying

552
00:21:15.002 --> 00:21:18.052
that you have now entered the world of reality TV.

553
00:21:18.362 --> 00:21:20.002
Meaning TV has become your reality.

554
00:21:20.002 --> 00:21:21.402
Reality doesn't exist.

555
00:21:21.402 --> 00:21:22.902
I was up in Trafford Mall,

556
00:21:22.902 --> 00:21:26.662
I talked in Bath in March of this year, 2010,

557
00:21:26.662 --> 00:21:31.262
and then I went with a friend up to Manchester.

558
00:21:31.262 --> 00:21:34.262
The biggest spectacle up there was this gargantuan Mall,

559
00:21:34.262 --> 00:21:35.782
because you gotta see this--

560
00:21:35.782 --> 00:21:37.022
<v Voiceover>I haven't seen it.</v>

561
00:21:37.022 --> 00:21:38.382
<v ->And he's telling me you gotta see this</v>

562
00:21:38.382 --> 00:21:39.522
cause you're just not gonna believe it,

563
00:21:39.522 --> 00:21:40.482
the symbolism.

564
00:21:40.482 --> 00:21:42.842
It's got every Greek God that the mind could dream up--

565
00:21:42.842 --> 00:21:44.382
<v Voiceover>In Manchester?</v>

566
00:21:44.382 --> 00:21:45.862
<v ->Yeah, in Manchester at a place</v>

567
00:21:45.862 --> 00:21:47.482
where the Manchester United Football Team

568
00:21:47.482 --> 00:21:48.602
used to play, Trafford.

569
00:21:48.602 --> 00:21:50.822
Well they built this palace, Versailles,

570
00:21:50.822 --> 00:21:54.222
and here you go, slepping up with your shopping bags

571
00:21:54.222 --> 00:21:55.882
and you look like you're going up the gardens

572
00:21:55.882 --> 00:21:57.282
of Versailles Palace.

573
00:21:57.282 --> 00:21:59.482
You walk in and there's immense chandeliers,

574
00:21:59.482 --> 00:22:02.622
you've got spiral staircases and marble,

575
00:22:02.622 --> 00:22:06.212
everything is just plants and goddesses

576
00:22:06.562 --> 00:22:09.282
and weird occult phrases and solar disks

577
00:22:09.282 --> 00:22:10.742
and rams head and Bacchus

578
00:22:10.742 --> 00:22:13.622
and hearts, Christian red heart of Jesus

579
00:22:13.622 --> 00:22:16.362
and I've got photographs, I took meticulous photographs

580
00:22:16.362 --> 00:22:17.502
of all of this.

581
00:22:17.502 --> 00:22:20.262
I'm not even including the architecture itself

582
00:22:20.262 --> 00:22:23.702
or the fact that the murals or the names of the shops,

583
00:22:23.702 --> 00:22:25.422
we're leaving that out.

584
00:22:25.422 --> 00:22:26.862
We're just talking about floor design, mosaics,

585
00:22:26.862 --> 00:22:28.802
gods and goddesses, Kabilism.

586
00:22:28.802 --> 00:22:31.442
What's this all about?

587
00:22:31.442 --> 00:22:32.962
Half the people in it

588
00:22:32.962 --> 00:22:35.322
haven't the foggiest idea about Greek and Latin,

589
00:22:35.322 --> 00:22:39.102
Greek and Roman Gods and yet here they are in a palace, why?

590
00:22:39.102 --> 00:22:41.262
Is to make your little hovel, sitting in your home,

591
00:22:41.262 --> 00:22:43.902
a secondary home, we don't want you to be at home

592
00:22:43.902 --> 00:22:45.442
in that little box that we've given you.

593
00:22:45.442 --> 00:22:49.152
Come and drink coffee in this beautiful palatial place.

594
00:22:49.162 --> 00:22:51.852
Do you know that they even have gazebos, inside?

595
00:22:51.982 --> 00:22:54.202
Did you know that they had a ship motif

596
00:22:54.202 --> 00:22:56.562
with a band playing on the stage,

597
00:22:56.562 --> 00:22:59.672
as if you're out on the ocean on a cruise?

598
00:23:00.082 --> 00:23:03.442
Then at night, in the daytime the roof is clouds,

599
00:23:03.442 --> 00:23:06.502
as evening falls in real-time, real life,

600
00:23:06.502 --> 00:23:09.212
stars come out inside the mall.

601
00:23:09.622 --> 00:23:11.402
So in other words, these people said--

602
00:23:11.402 --> 00:23:12.582
<v Voiceover>It's kind of like Las Vegas,</v>

603
00:23:12.582 --> 00:23:14.202
the Paris and--

604
00:23:14.202 --> 00:23:16.342
<v ->Yeah, that was the first time I've ever experienced this.</v>

605
00:23:16.342 --> 00:23:19.302
I'm blown away and we sat there and observed.

606
00:23:19.302 --> 00:23:20.702
<v Voiceover>Yeah, it's disorienting.</v>

607
00:23:20.702 --> 00:23:22.182
<v ->Yeah, and what it's really doing is saying</v>

608
00:23:22.182 --> 00:23:24.582
forget reality, forget nature, we are facsimile,

609
00:23:24.582 --> 00:23:26.502
we're making a facsimile of it.

610
00:23:26.502 --> 00:23:29.372
The Taco Bell looked like Tutan Kamen's--

611
00:23:29.422 --> 00:23:30.462
(laughing)

612
00:23:30.462 --> 00:23:31.682
I'm not joking you.

613
00:23:31.682 --> 00:23:34.722
They had a Mayan design on like Pizza Hut

614
00:23:34.722 --> 00:23:35.962
or something like that.

615
00:23:35.962 --> 00:23:37.382
I've got the photographs,

616
00:23:37.382 --> 00:23:39.942
every thing was designed on temples and spiritual things.

617
00:23:39.942 --> 00:23:42.622
They had the Mayan calendar,

618
00:23:42.622 --> 00:23:44.862
they had Quetzalcoatl, they had Horace,

619
00:23:44.862 --> 00:23:48.762
they had they're Pepsi and Coke machines in the tolilets

620
00:23:48.762 --> 00:23:50.702
designed like the temple at Dendira,

621
00:23:50.702 --> 00:23:51.662
(laughing)

622
00:23:51.662 --> 00:23:52.902
I'm not joking you--

623
00:23:52.902 --> 00:23:54.322
<v Voiceover>I've got to go see that.</v>

624
00:23:54.322 --> 00:23:55.942
<v ->Everybody is swimming around in this place,</v>

625
00:23:55.942 --> 00:23:59.042
inwardly sort of, partly liking the euphoria,

626
00:23:59.042 --> 00:24:01.002
partly turned on because it's spiritual,

627
00:24:01.002 --> 00:24:03.402
I mean you've got pictures of Hathor and Isis on the wall,

628
00:24:03.402 --> 00:24:04.562
it is spiritual.

629
00:24:04.562 --> 00:24:06.542
And it's alluring to one aspect of your mind

630
00:24:06.542 --> 00:24:08.482
but it's deeply disturbing to another

631
00:24:08.482 --> 00:24:09.882
because it's not the real thing,

632
00:24:09.882 --> 00:24:12.082
it's not holy, it's just food and garbage.

633
00:24:12.082 --> 00:24:15.682
So this creates this great inner schism

634
00:24:15.682 --> 00:24:18.102
and again coming back to a more primitive level

635
00:24:18.102 --> 00:24:19.582
you don't want to be at home.

636
00:24:19.582 --> 00:24:21.082
You can come and eat here, you can walk around,

637
00:24:21.082 --> 00:24:22.222
you can take your girlfriend out,

638
00:24:22.222 --> 00:24:23.502
you can sit and listen to the band,

639
00:24:23.502 --> 00:24:24.742
you can watch the stars change,

640
00:24:24.742 --> 00:24:26.552
the clouds will come out.

641
00:24:26.722 --> 00:24:30.602
Suddenly you prefer this simulacra, better.

642
00:24:30.602 --> 00:24:32.502
John Badliard the French philosopher

643
00:24:32.502 --> 00:24:34.062
said that's exactly what's gonna happen.

644
00:24:34.062 --> 00:24:35.802
As man surrounds himself with the more plastic,

645
00:24:35.802 --> 00:24:38.842
as he takes his kids around Toys-R-Us

646
00:24:38.842 --> 00:24:41.242
and just has all these gizmos and gadgets and robots

647
00:24:41.242 --> 00:24:44.062
and cyborgs and his TV has a million romo-controls

648
00:24:44.062 --> 00:24:46.892
and blueberries and Blackberries and whatever,

649
00:24:47.302 --> 00:24:48.722
you will become as artificial

650
00:24:48.722 --> 00:24:50.932
as the world that surrounds you,

651
00:24:50.982 --> 00:24:52.022
which is what's happening now,

652
00:24:52.022 --> 00:24:53.982
I said at the talk, conversation is a dead art.

653
00:24:53.982 --> 00:24:56.122
You ask somebody, "Is anybody sitting in this seat?"

654
00:24:56.122 --> 00:24:59.872
They look at you as if you've just fallen out of the sky.

655
00:25:00.262 --> 00:25:01.782
<v Voiceover>Right, you've offended them.</v>

656
00:25:01.782 --> 00:25:03.822
<v ->They're afraid and they're fidgeting with a gadget,</v>

657
00:25:03.822 --> 00:25:05.862
cause anybody they talk to or look at has to be

658
00:25:05.862 --> 00:25:08.002
through the means of a impersonal gadget.

659
00:25:08.002 --> 00:25:09.882
There's no such thing as a conversation,

660
00:25:09.882 --> 00:25:11.222
person-to-person, anymore.

661
00:25:11.222 --> 00:25:13.382
It has to be by way of some technical device.

662
00:25:13.382 --> 00:25:15.262
How does this tie into the feminism?

663
00:25:15.262 --> 00:25:17.042
I showed a picture of a woman,

664
00:25:17.042 --> 00:25:18.382
you know the typical cyborg,

665
00:25:18.382 --> 00:25:20.382
one of these so-called pop singers

666
00:25:20.382 --> 00:25:22.462
and I use that in as loose as possible connotation,

667
00:25:22.462 --> 00:25:24.742
Beyoncé, or whoever it might have been,

668
00:25:24.742 --> 00:25:26.722
who's the blond who's all famous now?

669
00:25:26.722 --> 00:25:29.652
This hideous monstrosity that loves blood and death?

670
00:25:30.062 --> 00:25:31.402
<v Voiceover>I'm not really to up, who is it?</v>

671
00:25:31.402 --> 00:25:35.812
<v ->Lady Gaga, half cyborg, half herself, so to speak.</v>

672
00:25:36.942 --> 00:25:38.462
I try to analyze this for the audience

673
00:25:38.462 --> 00:25:39.882
and I said, what is that really showing?

674
00:25:39.882 --> 00:25:40.882
What do these images show,

675
00:25:40.882 --> 00:25:42.462
does it not show the whole thing

676
00:25:42.462 --> 00:25:43.902
that is happening in our society today?

677
00:25:43.902 --> 00:25:45.722
In which the feminine has been,

678
00:25:45.722 --> 00:25:49.162
as we talked about what was women meant to be?

679
00:25:49.162 --> 00:25:50.822
Well I'll tell you what women is,

680
00:25:50.822 --> 00:25:53.002
woman is a threat, woman has always been a threat.

681
00:25:53.002 --> 00:25:55.302
Woman is higher on the ontological ladder than man

682
00:25:55.302 --> 00:25:58.292
because she gives birth as the gods give birth.

683
00:25:58.902 --> 00:26:01.142
Gods give birth to the human race

684
00:26:01.142 --> 00:26:03.112
but woman gives birth to man.

685
00:26:03.162 --> 00:26:04.942
So man is below woman in that sense

686
00:26:04.942 --> 00:26:06.182
that he can't give birth.

687
00:26:06.182 --> 00:26:08.422
Technology is his way to rival

688
00:26:08.422 --> 00:26:10.312
the female power of giving birth.

689
00:26:11.002 --> 00:26:12.522
Woman therefore, has always been a threat.

690
00:26:12.522 --> 00:26:13.682
What she represents.

691
00:26:13.682 --> 00:26:15.562
Now the individual woman's threat is minuscule

692
00:26:15.562 --> 00:26:17.302
but archetypally, racially,

693
00:26:17.302 --> 00:26:18.882
over the millenia that we've lived,

694
00:26:18.882 --> 00:26:21.522
the archetype of the female, which Jung named Anema

695
00:26:21.522 --> 00:26:23.702
and there's other languaging for this,

696
00:26:23.702 --> 00:26:26.802
becomes a very, very demonic and threatening thing

697
00:26:26.802 --> 00:26:28.362
to the hardened masculine,

698
00:26:28.362 --> 00:26:30.782
who will do anything but integrate.

699
00:26:30.782 --> 00:26:33.612
She's not only a threat, she's a mysterious female.

700
00:26:33.822 --> 00:26:35.862
Right, the book of Tao Te Ching

701
00:26:35.862 --> 00:26:37.362
said that she is the mysterious female,

702
00:26:37.362 --> 00:26:38.582
the everlasting female.

703
00:26:38.582 --> 00:26:40.782
This mystery is the secret of it all.

704
00:26:40.782 --> 00:26:42.882
The mystery which is nature,

705
00:26:42.882 --> 00:26:44.522
ultimately is impenetrable to man,

706
00:26:44.522 --> 00:26:46.842
what's called in scientific lingo, negentropic.

707
00:26:46.842 --> 00:26:48.862
They can't find the plug-in switch,

708
00:26:48.862 --> 00:26:51.442
how does the sun rise, how does the clouds pass,

709
00:26:51.442 --> 00:26:53.512
how does this tree grow out of mud?

710
00:26:53.522 --> 00:26:56.192
How does this tree grow out of mud and become that?

711
00:26:56.422 --> 00:26:58.252
Where's the switch?

712
00:26:58.342 --> 00:27:00.222
So science is looking for the switch

713
00:27:00.222 --> 00:27:02.522
to find the secret of the power of nature.

714
00:27:02.522 --> 00:27:04.922
Nature's negentropic, which means self-sustaining,

715
00:27:04.922 --> 00:27:07.212
everlasting, without life, without death.

716
00:27:07.442 --> 00:27:10.102
The masculine hardened, perverted, psychopathic mind

717
00:27:10.102 --> 00:27:12.102
wants the secret of that power.

718
00:27:12.102 --> 00:27:14.262
Ties into Mary Shelley's Frankenstein thing

719
00:27:14.262 --> 00:27:16.082
and things we can't have time to explore.

720
00:27:16.082 --> 00:27:17.402
It's a very well known motif in the

721
00:27:17.402 --> 00:27:19.492
Gothic horror fiction genre.

722
00:27:20.302 --> 00:27:21.522
Since they can't find it

723
00:27:21.522 --> 00:27:23.842
and since they're ontologically lower than women

724
00:27:23.842 --> 00:27:25.362
on the ontological scale,

725
00:27:25.362 --> 00:27:28.842
they're technology is their way of rivaling the female

726
00:27:28.842 --> 00:27:31.182
and they're saying since the female is uncontainable,

727
00:27:31.182 --> 00:27:34.482
unknowable, impenetrable, we will create

728
00:27:34.482 --> 00:27:36.842
the cyborg technology version of the female

729
00:27:36.842 --> 00:27:38.222
because that's programmable,

730
00:27:38.222 --> 00:27:40.472
that's understandable, that's just circuits.

731
00:27:41.542 --> 00:27:43.742
Watch us create all humanity in this

732
00:27:43.742 --> 00:27:45.122
and we'll create the housing project

733
00:27:45.122 --> 00:27:46.742
which is the global village for this.

734
00:27:46.742 --> 00:27:49.322
So what is happening on the archetypal level,

735
00:27:49.322 --> 00:27:51.242
on the higher level, is the death of femininity

736
00:27:51.242 --> 00:27:53.882
and the continuing war against the female,

737
00:27:53.882 --> 00:27:57.182
technology being the weapon that has constantly been used,

738
00:27:57.182 --> 00:28:00.112
age upon age to rape her of her ultimate power.

739
00:28:00.522 --> 00:28:04.822
Okay, Michael, is that fatalistic, is it all over,

740
00:28:04.822 --> 00:28:06.082
are we done for?

741
00:28:06.082 --> 00:28:07.302
<v Voiceover>No, there's something else rising.</v>

742
00:28:07.302 --> 00:28:08.882
<v ->Right, because the thing is</v>

743
00:28:08.882 --> 00:28:11.782
that that very need to upscale the weaponry

744
00:28:11.782 --> 00:28:14.982
shows you that something else is taking place.

745
00:28:14.982 --> 00:28:16.442
<v Voiceover>In response to something.</v>

746
00:28:16.442 --> 00:28:17.942
<v ->It shows you that, yeah,</v>

747
00:28:17.942 --> 00:28:22.942
the other is about to make it's presence known.

748
00:28:24.082 --> 00:28:26.142
What it also means is that all this other stuff,

749
00:28:26.142 --> 00:28:28.702
remember we talked about the girls

750
00:28:28.702 --> 00:28:31.322
getting sick of the cosmetics and sick of what TV's giving.

751
00:28:31.322 --> 00:28:33.903
Then on another level, on this higher level,

752
00:28:33.903 --> 00:28:37.542
even part of us is getting sick of the simulacra.

753
00:28:37.542 --> 00:28:40.922
Because an idea of reality

754
00:28:40.922 --> 00:28:43.232
can only last a certain amount of time.

755
00:28:43.342 --> 00:28:44.482
We talked on a previous interview

756
00:28:44.482 --> 00:28:45.822
and we mentioned that evil has within it

757
00:28:45.822 --> 00:28:47.002
the seeds of its own destruction.

758
00:28:47.002 --> 00:28:49.282
Any thing corrupt, unjust is born to fail,

759
00:28:49.282 --> 00:28:51.632
is born to crumble.

760
00:28:52.022 --> 00:28:53.142
We're in that very age now,

761
00:28:53.142 --> 00:28:56.042
so all this new machinations and moving

762
00:28:56.042 --> 00:28:58.282
and saber rattling and all these new machinations

763
00:28:58.282 --> 00:29:00.922
of the dictators is because they know

764
00:29:00.922 --> 00:29:03.052
that the ground from under them is changing.

765
00:29:03.562 --> 00:29:06.202
If we don't realize that, we lose hope and they win again.

766
00:29:06.202 --> 00:29:08.962
So what we have to realize is that the forces of nature

767
00:29:08.962 --> 00:29:11.042
can never be defeated, they literally are negentropic,

768
00:29:11.042 --> 00:29:13.972
there is no "on" switch, that only exists in the ego,

769
00:29:14.182 --> 00:29:16.622
that's the ego world and that's the world of the technology

770
00:29:16.622 --> 00:29:18.282
that has on and off buttons

771
00:29:18.282 --> 00:29:21.082
and controllable components

772
00:29:21.082 --> 00:29:23.272
and programmable components.

773
00:29:23.442 --> 00:29:25.662
Because of this ancient, and goodness knows,

774
00:29:25.662 --> 00:29:27.063
that's there's this whole other question

775
00:29:27.063 --> 00:29:28.342
of even how ancient it is,

776
00:29:28.342 --> 00:29:30.702
but even leaving that aside, that ancient antipathy,

777
00:29:31.182 --> 00:29:34.973
not between male and female as it has been,

778
00:29:36.923 --> 00:29:38.393
I'll go easy,

779
00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:42.353
I'll say somewhat misguidedly represented in front of us.

780
00:29:42.624 --> 00:29:45.553
The war has been between masculine and feminine,

781
00:29:46.003 --> 00:29:47.794
which is within each of us,

782
00:29:47.823 --> 00:29:49.704
it's not just a polarized thing at all.

783
00:29:49.704 --> 00:29:53.893
It's to suspend or permanently

784
00:29:55.584 --> 00:29:58.163
delay the ultimate chemical wedding

785
00:29:58.163 --> 00:30:00.123
which is the reason why we exist.

786
00:30:00.123 --> 00:30:02.813
Man on this planet, Aristotle called it entelechy,

787
00:30:03.363 --> 00:30:05.973
the natural movement of this to that.

788
00:30:06.523 --> 00:30:09.183
When you plant a potato, it becomes a potato not a daffodil.

789
00:30:09.183 --> 00:30:11.203
When you plant an oak it becomes an oak, not an elm.

790
00:30:11.203 --> 00:30:14.304
Within the potentiality, the seed, is the end

791
00:30:14.304 --> 00:30:17.843
and he used the Greek word entelechy to say,

792
00:30:17.843 --> 00:30:20.893
in the seed is it's final goal.

793
00:30:21.283 --> 00:30:22.863
The fractal people know all about this,

794
00:30:22.863 --> 00:30:24.123
they worked it out now.

795
00:30:24.123 --> 00:30:26.383
So the thing is that also psychologically, biologically

796
00:30:26.383 --> 00:30:28.003
and humanly, it's the same.

797
00:30:28.003 --> 00:30:29.784
Within the human being is the God.

798
00:30:29.784 --> 00:30:32.173
Within the human being is the Buddha.

799
00:30:32.743 --> 00:30:34.303
Within a human being is the enlightened one,

800
00:30:34.303 --> 00:30:36.343
the Magus, the wizard, the great one,

801
00:30:36.343 --> 00:30:38.193
the high one, the elder.

802
00:30:38.383 --> 00:30:39.903
And whether you like it or not,

803
00:30:39.903 --> 00:30:42.283
and no matter how many boulders you put on top of it,

804
00:30:42.283 --> 00:30:44.343
no matter how many dead ends you go down,

805
00:30:44.343 --> 00:30:46.143
no matter how many distractions you get into

806
00:30:46.143 --> 00:30:47.743
and this was brought up beautifully

807
00:30:47.743 --> 00:30:49.633
in the movie Zardoz, by John Berman.

808
00:30:49.643 --> 00:30:51.423
No matter how much technology you build,

809
00:30:51.423 --> 00:30:53.443
no matter how many walls, no matter how many vortexes,

810
00:30:53.443 --> 00:30:56.003
no matter how many lies, no matter what you do

811
00:30:56.003 --> 00:30:59.693
that entelechy is going to continue.

812
00:31:00.983 --> 00:31:03.683
And no matter what kind of psychization, global village,

813
00:31:03.683 --> 00:31:07.043
silicon revolutions you create, you cannot stop that process

814
00:31:07.043 --> 00:31:09.793
because it's way deeper than thought.

815
00:31:10.303 --> 00:31:12.153
It's way deeper than mind.

816
00:31:12.523 --> 00:31:13.803
<v Voiceover>It's deeper than emotion,</v>

817
00:31:13.803 --> 00:31:16.133
it's something that is emoting the emotion.

818
00:31:16.143 --> 00:31:17.863
<v ->Absolutely, these are only the branches and flowers</v>

819
00:31:17.863 --> 00:31:19.063
of something infinitely deeper.

820
00:31:19.063 --> 00:31:20.663
Heidegger put it this way, he said,

821
00:31:20.663 --> 00:31:23.833
"Thinking is one step later than being."

822
00:31:24.163 --> 00:31:25.643
You have to exist before you can think,

823
00:31:25.643 --> 00:31:27.383
I mean, in one way it's a no-brainer.

824
00:31:27.383 --> 00:31:28.723
But unfortunately the greatest philosophers

825
00:31:28.723 --> 00:31:30.823
spent hundreds of years, trying to work it,

826
00:31:30.823 --> 00:31:32.393
and never got there.

827
00:31:32.403 --> 00:31:34.063
And then he said reason, which is an attribute of thought

828
00:31:34.063 --> 00:31:35.693
is one step later, again.

829
00:31:35.963 --> 00:31:38.163
So how can reason and how can even thinking

830
00:31:38.163 --> 00:31:39.873
know the mysteries of being?

831
00:31:40.043 --> 00:31:41.543
It's like a three-year-old knowing

832
00:31:41.543 --> 00:31:43.103
it's mother has a personality and a life

833
00:31:43.103 --> 00:31:45.783
and a youth and all these interests.

834
00:31:45.783 --> 00:31:47.583
The child is incapable of understanding that,

835
00:31:47.583 --> 00:31:49.153
it's just not possible.

836
00:31:49.243 --> 00:31:51.083
So all the scientism, all the religions

837
00:31:51.083 --> 00:31:53.893
are attempting to use reason, and I'm not against reason,

838
00:31:53.903 --> 00:31:55.543
I'm actually an advocate of reason,

839
00:31:55.543 --> 00:31:57.833
but within a practical sphere of influence.

840
00:31:57.863 --> 00:31:59.883
I also know where reason's limits are.

841
00:31:59.883 --> 00:32:01.983
<v Voiceover>Yes, and not to the exclusion of the being.</v>

842
00:32:01.983 --> 00:32:03.563
<v ->Right, what has happened is that women,</v>

843
00:32:03.563 --> 00:32:05.843
men have been forced to conform

844
00:32:05.843 --> 00:32:08.473
to very impractical forms of reason.

845
00:32:08.983 --> 00:32:10.883
And then we have another split,

846
00:32:10.883 --> 00:32:13.293
reason and emotion, mind and heart.

847
00:32:13.543 --> 00:32:17.853
Once you've started on dualism it just keeps going, forever,

848
00:32:18.063 --> 00:32:20.493
until you come back to these fundamental understandings.

849
00:32:20.543 --> 00:32:22.313
So getting back to what we were talking about.

850
00:32:23.143 --> 00:32:26.413
This negentropic antological movement cannot be altered.

851
00:32:27.803 --> 00:32:30.383
Big brother and anyone who buys into that mode of thought,

852
00:32:30.383 --> 00:32:31.973
in other words, anyone who shares

853
00:32:31.973 --> 00:32:34.673
their psychopathy is deadly afraid of it,

854
00:32:34.863 --> 00:32:36.433
and I'll tell you why.

855
00:32:36.743 --> 00:32:39.543
It's because before you can have a chemical wedding

856
00:32:39.543 --> 00:32:42.193
you must experience a chemical divorce.

857
00:32:42.823 --> 00:32:45.193
It's the opposite of normal life,

858
00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:46.923
first you get married, then you get divorced.

859
00:32:46.923 --> 00:32:48.253
Right?

860
00:32:48.303 --> 00:32:49.463
(laughing)

861
00:32:49.463 --> 00:32:50.603
This is opposite, in spiritual terms

862
00:32:50.603 --> 00:32:53.033
everything must die, before you can inherit her.

863
00:32:53.743 --> 00:32:54.763
You gotta meet Shiva

864
00:32:54.763 --> 00:32:57.105
before Shaklti bothers opening the door, right?

865
00:32:57.554 --> 00:32:58.554
<v ->[Voiceover} Right.</v>

866
00:32:58.554 --> 00:32:59.794
<v ->The religions go, well that's a bit of a problem,</v>

867
00:32:59.794 --> 00:33:03.034
I know, we'll don ourselves up as Shakti,

868
00:33:03.034 --> 00:33:05.184
we'll have all of her trappings.

869
00:33:05.974 --> 00:33:07.954
<v Voiceover>To somehow bypass that necessary step--</v>

870
00:33:07.954 --> 00:33:09.214
<v ->Yes, to create another simulacra.</v>

871
00:33:09.214 --> 00:33:10.435
<v Voiceover>To create the allusion</v>

872
00:33:10.435 --> 00:33:11.794
that we can bypass that step.

873
00:33:11.794 --> 00:33:13.034
<v ->Right and I believe, now,</v>

874
00:33:13.034 --> 00:33:14.755
it is, it's not my belief,

875
00:33:14.755 --> 00:33:16.474
it's becoming unsustainable to everyone

876
00:33:16.474 --> 00:33:17.594
all over the world.

877
00:33:17.594 --> 00:33:18.674
<v Voiceover>It is.</v>

878
00:33:18.674 --> 00:33:20.275
<v ->So, there gig, they're trying to think,</v>

879
00:33:20.275 --> 00:33:21.475
"What are we gonna do now?"

880
00:33:21.475 --> 00:33:23.074
We're gonna have to sell out and move shop,

881
00:33:23.074 --> 00:33:25.925
Age of Aquarius and age of awakening,

882
00:33:25.994 --> 00:33:28.264
oh damn, we might be out of business soon.

883
00:33:29.114 --> 00:33:30.794
So in came the New Age,

884
00:33:30.794 --> 00:33:34.364
in comes a bunch of other bogus Spineract stuff.

885
00:33:35.395 --> 00:33:39.054
In will come a regression, like we talked about earlier,

886
00:33:39.054 --> 00:33:41.084
to hardened forms of religion.

887
00:33:41.755 --> 00:33:43.034
Because when the softer, more egalitarian

888
00:33:43.034 --> 00:33:44.604
are all against religions.

889
00:33:44.635 --> 00:33:46.394
But once the egalitarian models start weakening

890
00:33:46.394 --> 00:33:48.595
there's a fear reaction, as we've seen,

891
00:33:48.595 --> 00:33:49.994
<v Voiceover>Right, go to the safe and known.</v>

892
00:33:49.994 --> 00:33:51.274
<v ->Right and then you have,</v>

893
00:33:51.274 --> 00:33:52.414
you know big brother will bring out a champion

894
00:33:52.414 --> 00:33:53.594
like a George Bush or an Obama,

895
00:33:53.594 --> 00:33:54.674
with a big smile on their face

896
00:33:54.674 --> 00:33:55.934
and a big stick behind their back

897
00:33:55.934 --> 00:33:57.594
to make sure that the egg you want

898
00:33:57.594 --> 00:34:00.184
to conform or collectivize in yet another way.

899
00:34:01.134 --> 00:34:02.754
My work deals a lot in all these elements

900
00:34:02.754 --> 00:34:04.464
of that make you collectivize.

901
00:34:04.614 --> 00:34:07.474
So the chemical divorce is part of a package

902
00:34:07.474 --> 00:34:09.434
of spiritual evolution, Shamans knew this,

903
00:34:09.434 --> 00:34:10.834
the elders, the Druids knew this.

904
00:34:10.834 --> 00:34:12.234
We talked about the Druids before,

905
00:34:12.234 --> 00:34:13.434
one of their ideologies

906
00:34:13.434 --> 00:34:15.034
was that you have to die to everything

907
00:34:15.034 --> 00:34:17.164
before she will come to you.

908
00:34:17.855 --> 00:34:19.535
Now who is she gonna come to first?

909
00:34:19.535 --> 00:34:22.734
Well, she's a she, so I would assume that the feminine

910
00:34:22.734 --> 00:34:26.774
is in closer ontological proximity, than the masculine.

911
00:34:26.774 --> 00:34:28.574
The masculine's going to get it as well,

912
00:34:28.574 --> 00:34:32.954
but in this spiritual, hate to use the word hierarchy,

913
00:34:32.954 --> 00:34:35.224
but whatever, in this continuum

914
00:34:35.774 --> 00:34:37.474
the feminine is the most perceptive.

915
00:34:37.474 --> 00:34:40.116
If you study the part of the Tarot, Aeon,

916
00:34:40.116 --> 00:34:45.055
it's also called judgement in the Rider-Waite deck

917
00:34:45.055 --> 00:34:47.595
and if you also pull out card six, known as the Lovers,

918
00:34:47.595 --> 00:34:49.435
you'll see something very interesting

919
00:34:49.435 --> 00:34:50.916
and that is there's three figures,

920
00:34:50.916 --> 00:34:52.625
a woman, a child and a man.

921
00:34:52.775 --> 00:34:55.595
Each time it's the woman's head who's looking at Divinity

922
00:34:55.595 --> 00:34:59.185
and the man is looking at the female on both of those cards.

923
00:34:59.275 --> 00:35:00.755
Divinity is either blowing a trumpet,

924
00:35:00.755 --> 00:35:02.675
in other words bringing down spiritual energy

925
00:35:02.675 --> 00:35:04.555
and in the mountains in the back

926
00:35:04.555 --> 00:35:07.106
the woman's head is the one above.

927
00:35:07.555 --> 00:35:09.575
She is the divine mediator, remember we said,

928
00:35:09.575 --> 00:35:11.215
"What is it that the woman's duty was?"

929
00:35:11.215 --> 00:35:12.555
Et cetera, et cetera.

930
00:35:12.555 --> 00:35:15.465
She is the mediator or conduit for that knowledge.

931
00:35:15.496 --> 00:35:16.515
What has happened

932
00:35:16.515 --> 00:35:17.935
since the advent of the hierarchical religions

933
00:35:17.935 --> 00:35:19.835
is that's been cut off, drastically.

934
00:35:19.835 --> 00:35:21.335
They murdered witches, they murdered anyone,

935
00:35:21.335 --> 00:35:24.235
any elders in my country and others they did it

936
00:35:24.235 --> 00:35:27.085
and they stopped it, they stopped that flow.

937
00:35:28.015 --> 00:35:29.915
Then let's shift focus again

938
00:35:29.915 --> 00:35:31.435
and look at it psychologically

939
00:35:31.435 --> 00:35:33.195
and it brings me right back to what you were talking about.

940
00:35:33.195 --> 00:35:36.415
If woman is the female and the feminine

941
00:35:36.415 --> 00:35:39.295
and let's embrace, let's also say the woman

942
00:35:39.295 --> 00:35:41.475
is the conduit for this divine revelation

943
00:35:41.475 --> 00:35:46.025
and it will reach the male, masculine mind,

944
00:35:46.435 --> 00:35:48.616
however the message for this age, right now,

945
00:35:48.616 --> 00:35:51.965
is that the woman first has to fill her own chalice up

946
00:35:52.275 --> 00:35:53.455
before she can--

947
00:35:53.455 --> 00:35:55.216
<v Voiceover>To really, truly embody the feminine,</v>

948
00:35:55.216 --> 00:35:56.435
once again.

949
00:35:56.435 --> 00:35:57.976
<v ->Right, yes, because once you say conduit,</v>

950
00:35:57.976 --> 00:35:59.885
well that just sorta like a neuter thing,

951
00:35:59.915 --> 00:36:01.135
oh, I'm just a conduit.

952
00:36:01.135 --> 00:36:02.455
No, no, no, it's a conduit

953
00:36:02.455 --> 00:36:04.645
but first you must be imbued in it, first.

954
00:36:04.675 --> 00:36:05.675
So in other words,

955
00:36:05.675 --> 00:36:08.465
women are now the first ones to be tested by guess who?

956
00:36:08.635 --> 00:36:11.605
Her, the nameless one.

957
00:36:12.435 --> 00:36:14.675
So your anger, the thing that you're noticing in the women

958
00:36:14.675 --> 00:36:18.385
is the beginning of women being recalled back.

959
00:36:18.695 --> 00:36:21.116
Demeter is calling Persephone out of the underworld.

960
00:36:21.116 --> 00:36:22.676
She's saying, "Remember the job?

961
00:36:22.676 --> 00:36:25.095
"Stop following the males, we got work to do."

962
00:36:25.095 --> 00:36:27.755
Oh what was that again, right.

963
00:36:27.755 --> 00:36:30.155
So the awakening of the feminine

964
00:36:30.155 --> 00:36:34.155
which is Arthur after they find the Grail,

965
00:36:34.155 --> 00:36:36.366
the world comes to life again, right?

966
00:36:36.775 --> 00:36:38.495
But look at how much death and winter

967
00:36:38.495 --> 00:36:41.445
they had to go through before they inherited it again.

968
00:36:41.595 --> 00:36:43.295
And the chalice and the keeper of who?

969
00:36:43.295 --> 00:36:44.705
Three maidens, right.

970
00:36:44.915 --> 00:36:46.275
So here we go,

971
00:36:46.275 --> 00:36:48.815
but I believe that the call goes out to the feminine

972
00:36:48.815 --> 00:36:50.345
and that includes men.

973
00:36:50.396 --> 00:36:52.305
The feminine man is included in this.

974
00:36:52.395 --> 00:36:53.396
<v Voiceover>Yes, the feminine aspect of men, yes.</v>

975
00:36:53.396 --> 00:36:54.535
<v ->But to the female as well,</v>

976
00:36:54.535 --> 00:36:57.435
therefore if the females of the world are found wanting

977
00:36:57.435 --> 00:36:58.955
as they possibly may be,

978
00:36:58.955 --> 00:37:01.395
then we have a problem, we have to resolve that issue.

979
00:37:01.395 --> 00:37:02.775
That's another thing to look at,

980
00:37:02.775 --> 00:37:04.556
but if all goes well and women,

981
00:37:04.556 --> 00:37:05.895
because they have it ancestrally,

982
00:37:05.895 --> 00:37:07.455
start looking and answering this call

983
00:37:07.455 --> 00:37:09.655
and they're able to work with it

984
00:37:09.655 --> 00:37:12.455
then comes in the kind of energy that is required

985
00:37:12.455 --> 00:37:14.396
you see, to build the roots, the foundation.

986
00:37:14.396 --> 00:37:17.935
Pluto, excavates and gets rid of all the dirt

987
00:37:17.935 --> 00:37:20.255
and all the rubbish and all the nonsense.

988
00:37:20.255 --> 00:37:22.215
But then you have something to fill,

989
00:37:22.215 --> 00:37:23.886
you have a hole to re-seed.

990
00:37:24.356 --> 00:37:27.375
That's when that feminine, liquid, natural energy

991
00:37:27.375 --> 00:37:29.415
needs to flow, it's not man's job.

992
00:37:29.415 --> 00:37:32.415
I said in the talk, women bring children,

993
00:37:32.415 --> 00:37:34.215
boys and girls into the world,

994
00:37:34.215 --> 00:37:36.995
men prepare the world fit to live in for those children.

995
00:37:36.995 --> 00:37:39.116
So we have different roles, different dynamics.

996
00:37:39.116 --> 00:37:40.735
Feminism blurred all this on purpose.

997
00:37:40.735 --> 00:37:42.535
They made a carrot to make it,

998
00:37:42.535 --> 00:37:43.615
and I'm not doubting them,

999
00:37:43.615 --> 00:37:46.566
women did need that level of empowerment.

1000
00:37:46.916 --> 00:37:48.035
<v Voiceover>Well, there was a strengthening</v>

1001
00:37:48.035 --> 00:37:49.095
that had to occur.

1002
00:37:49.095 --> 00:37:50.895
<v ->Yeah, yeah, I've read and I've studied them for years,</v>

1003
00:37:50.895 --> 00:37:52.855
I mean I'm a big fan of Camille Palli and people like that,

1004
00:37:52.855 --> 00:37:54.515
but the thing is that I always sensed

1005
00:37:54.515 --> 00:37:56.645
that what was behind it was a deeper, darker agenda.

1006
00:37:56.735 --> 00:38:01.455
From this dark, poison, higher-up using certain women

1007
00:38:01.455 --> 00:38:02.895
who were from these royal families

1008
00:38:02.895 --> 00:38:04.675
to teach the women, give them the carrot

1009
00:38:04.675 --> 00:38:07.275
so that ultimately greater, darker evil could be done

1010
00:38:07.275 --> 00:38:09.375
which is to turn off the female from her spirituality

1011
00:38:09.375 --> 00:38:11.315
so that she ceases to be this conduit

1012
00:38:11.315 --> 00:38:12.635
because they're ahead of us,

1013
00:38:12.635 --> 00:38:13.555
they know what's happening.

1014
00:38:13.555 --> 00:38:14.635
They know what's coming,

1015
00:38:14.635 --> 00:38:16.115
they know that Pluto is coming,

1016
00:38:16.115 --> 00:38:18.515
that energy is to excavate, to deconstruct

1017
00:38:18.515 --> 00:38:20.115
and then they know that,

1018
00:38:20.115 --> 00:38:23.195
where's that liquid, vital, mercurial, silver energy

1019
00:38:23.195 --> 00:38:24.595
gonna come from, right?

1020
00:38:24.595 --> 00:38:26.775
This is been spoken about in umpteen films as well,

1021
00:38:26.775 --> 00:38:28.335
The Nucleus of the Sun and the Moon,

1022
00:38:28.335 --> 00:38:29.575
there's many ways of languaging this.

1023
00:38:29.575 --> 00:38:31.055
In the Yin Yang symbol,

1024
00:38:31.055 --> 00:38:33.295
in the white is the black, in the black is the white.

1025
00:38:33.295 --> 00:38:37.475
A nucleation, almost saying,

1026
00:38:37.475 --> 00:38:39.295
"Well then what is blackness and what is whiteness?"

1027
00:38:39.295 --> 00:38:41.875
It's an incredible thing, the whole

1028
00:38:41.875 --> 00:38:43.715
idea of all magic, all ritual, all yoga,

1029
00:38:43.715 --> 00:38:46.115
all spirituality was the nucleation.

1030
00:38:46.115 --> 00:38:50.675
The Buddhists, it's false, it's all false,

1031
00:38:50.675 --> 00:38:52.435
it's just masculinization under another name.

1032
00:38:52.435 --> 00:38:54.755
Hinduism, you know, Christianity,

1033
00:38:54.755 --> 00:38:56.535
look at Islam, look at Judaism.

1034
00:38:56.535 --> 00:38:59.035
I can show you chapter, line and verse,

1035
00:38:59.035 --> 00:39:01.655
all their hatred of women, their denigration of the female,

1036
00:39:01.655 --> 00:39:03.235
and also of the feminine,

1037
00:39:03.235 --> 00:39:04.815
while they're walking around in flowing robes

1038
00:39:04.815 --> 00:39:07.845
with the long hair.

1039
00:39:07.876 --> 00:39:09.076
<v Voiceover>To usurp that role, falsely.</v>

1040
00:39:09.076 --> 00:39:10.195
<v ->Usurping it, absolutely.</v>

1041
00:39:10.195 --> 00:39:11.495
They did it in the Goddess,

1042
00:39:11.495 --> 00:39:12.795
the Druids were entirely wiped out

1043
00:39:12.795 --> 00:39:14.705
because of this very purpose.

1044
00:39:15.395 --> 00:39:16.735
In fact there's, I wish we could get into it,

1045
00:39:16.735 --> 00:39:17.915
there's many great stories

1046
00:39:17.915 --> 00:39:19.535
that even predicted that this was gonna happen.

1047
00:39:19.535 --> 00:39:22.475
What now has to be the message is

1048
00:39:22.475 --> 00:39:26.575
is the woman has to learn how to turn inward

1049
00:39:29.495 --> 00:39:32.965
and embrace and integrate

1050
00:39:33.166 --> 00:39:38.166
all that dark, allegedly dark, energy that they're feeling.

1051
00:39:40.046 --> 00:39:41.696
They have to marry it,

1052
00:39:42.126 --> 00:39:44.326
they have to let it flow over them, own it.

1053
00:39:44.326 --> 00:39:45.286
<v Voiceover>Yes, own it.</v>

1054
00:39:45.286 --> 00:39:46.286
<v ->Own it, right.</v>

1055
00:39:46.286 --> 00:39:47.586
<v Voiceover>And this includes owning the wildness</v>

1056
00:39:47.586 --> 00:39:48.546
of that uncertainty because these feelings

1057
00:39:48.546 --> 00:39:50.006
have to go to a different level

1058
00:39:50.006 --> 00:39:52.236
than how they've been integrated before.

1059
00:39:52.326 --> 00:39:53.466
<v ->Right, but what happens</v>

1060
00:39:53.466 --> 00:39:56.507
if the architects of control step in

1061
00:39:56.507 --> 00:39:58.706
and go, "No, we know how to Canelize it,

1062
00:39:58.706 --> 00:40:01.557
"what we want from you is more man-hate."

1063
00:40:02.346 --> 00:40:03.347
<v Voiceover>That's no good.</v>

1064
00:40:03.347 --> 00:40:06.566
Feminism 2.0, oh gee, it's gonna happen again,

1065
00:40:06.566 --> 00:40:07.946
what are we gonna do, pal?

1066
00:40:07.946 --> 00:40:09.206
What're we gonna do, guys?

1067
00:40:09.206 --> 00:40:10.187
Then they say,

1068
00:40:10.187 --> 00:40:12.076
"Well, we just deflect it like we did before."

1069
00:40:12.146 --> 00:40:14.987
Women, blame men, we will now show you

1070
00:40:14.987 --> 00:40:17.476
the object of your hate.

1071
00:40:18.006 --> 00:40:19.206
It's your fathers again.

1072
00:40:19.206 --> 00:40:22.726
And then the whole viscous cycle will start again.

1073
00:40:22.726 --> 00:40:25.706
But, more than that, women have learned to hate themselves,

1074
00:40:25.706 --> 00:40:27.567
because as we said, the whole media, the cosmetic stuff

1075
00:40:27.567 --> 00:40:29.566
is designed to put these absolutely unbelievably,

1076
00:40:29.566 --> 00:40:30.986
actually they're psychotic,

1077
00:40:30.986 --> 00:40:33.666
but on the surface they look gorgeous and wonderful

1078
00:40:33.666 --> 00:40:35.686
and attractive and famous and glitzy

1079
00:40:35.686 --> 00:40:39.826
and then the woman can't meet that model,

1080
00:40:39.826 --> 00:40:41.946
or whatever it is, the false model

1081
00:40:41.946 --> 00:40:43.246
and then they beat themselves up.

1082
00:40:43.246 --> 00:40:44.346
So there's self-sadism there,

1083
00:40:44.346 --> 00:40:45.826
like I said, oppression and repression.

1084
00:40:45.826 --> 00:40:47.066
You're repressing yourself,

1085
00:40:47.066 --> 00:40:48.426
then there's oppression out there

1086
00:40:48.426 --> 00:40:49.887
and all of this is to do

1087
00:40:49.887 --> 00:40:53.296
is to stave off the real chemical wedding

1088
00:40:53.386 --> 00:40:56.146
so that the religions, the corrupt saturnian, solar,

1089
00:40:56.146 --> 00:40:57.966
martian institutions remain

1090
00:40:57.966 --> 00:40:59.836
as powerful as they've always been.

1091
00:41:00.126 --> 00:41:01.066
<v Voiceover>Go Pluto.</v>

1092
00:41:01.066 --> 00:41:02.386
<v ->They don't want Pluto,</v>

1093
00:41:02.386 --> 00:41:05.626
Pluto represents the entire melt-down

1094
00:41:05.626 --> 00:41:08.596
of their entire fabric.

1095
00:41:09.146 --> 00:41:10.326
<v Voiceover>So, it sounds to me</v>

1096
00:41:10.326 --> 00:41:11.886
like you're feeling pretty hopeful about this.

1097
00:41:11.886 --> 00:41:14.016
You're seeing that it's inevitable.

1098
00:41:14.186 --> 00:41:17.886
That this reversal of the everything

1099
00:41:17.886 --> 00:41:19.046
that has been spun into motion

1100
00:41:19.046 --> 00:41:23.436
by architects of control ultimately will have to occur.

1101
00:41:23.786 --> 00:41:26.056
It's nature, nature will prevail.

1102
00:41:26.206 --> 00:41:28.206
<v ->It always does and as we said</v>

1103
00:41:28.206 --> 00:41:32.816
it's part of the mind, it's part of this early trauma

1104
00:41:33.426 --> 00:41:36.056
that got us to have antipathy to nature.

1105
00:41:36.446 --> 00:41:39.686
There's so many traditions that have language for this,

1106
00:41:39.686 --> 00:41:41.446
I've kind of invented a new one,

1107
00:41:41.446 --> 00:41:43.686
I refer in my Disciples of the Mysterium work,

1108
00:41:43.686 --> 00:41:45.806
but really, it really nothing new

1109
00:41:45.806 --> 00:41:48.206
it's coming out of existential psychology of outer rank

1110
00:41:48.206 --> 00:41:50.066
and Eric Fromm and Victor Frankel

1111
00:41:50.066 --> 00:41:52.816
and Freud to a certain extent.

1112
00:41:53.486 --> 00:41:55.346
It's just a re-languaging in modern terms

1113
00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:58.186
of man's, when man was traumatized

1114
00:41:58.186 --> 00:42:01.646
in his consciousness that sorta set the ball

1115
00:42:01.646 --> 00:42:03.046
of psychopathy rolling

1116
00:42:03.046 --> 00:42:05.396
and our civilizations are the product of that psychopathy,

1117
00:42:07.476 --> 00:42:11.116
it's almost like the ego had an evil twin.

1118
00:42:11.906 --> 00:42:15.246
That I call mysterium, which is the need to have

1119
00:42:15.246 --> 00:42:20.246
fictionalized, fantasmagoric, images of God,

1120
00:42:20.846 --> 00:42:22.956
of reality and so forth and so on.

1121
00:42:23.226 --> 00:42:24.586
But without me getting into all of that

1122
00:42:24.586 --> 00:42:28.426
the essence of the ego, the root of the ego

1123
00:42:28.426 --> 00:42:31.236
and certainly the root of this mysterium concept

1124
00:42:31.666 --> 00:42:34.496
is antipathy to nature and it's very simple to understand.

1125
00:42:34.826 --> 00:42:36.766
When nature erupts around you

1126
00:42:36.766 --> 00:42:38.916
and destroys everything,

1127
00:42:39.326 --> 00:42:41.526
we're talking tidal waves, boulders falling from the sky,

1128
00:42:41.526 --> 00:42:43.636
meteors, I can take you and point to them,

1129
00:42:43.666 --> 00:42:45.306
even they're in Ireland, the whole landscape is--

1130
00:42:45.306 --> 00:42:46.406
<v Voiceover>The volcano, all of it.</v>

1131
00:42:46.406 --> 00:42:47.546
<v ->Right and we know it's there,</v>

1132
00:42:47.546 --> 00:42:49.386
you know, Carolina, Georgia is just pock marked with it.

1133
00:42:49.386 --> 00:42:51.246
There's been devastation's on this planet

1134
00:42:51.246 --> 00:42:53.036
that nobody could ever imagine.

1135
00:42:53.886 --> 00:42:56.796
Obviously you participated in that,

1136
00:42:57.386 --> 00:42:59.706
they weren't just sitting in an easy chair watching it.

1137
00:42:59.706 --> 00:43:02.266
In the aftermath of that

1138
00:43:02.266 --> 00:43:04.346
which itself was thousands of years

1139
00:43:04.346 --> 00:43:07.996
it left such an antipathy that you rose up against us,

1140
00:43:08.466 --> 00:43:10.786
it's like the myth of hell

1141
00:43:10.786 --> 00:43:12.346
actually is connected to all this.

1142
00:43:12.346 --> 00:43:14.406
Siberian mythology says that the Northwest

1143
00:43:14.406 --> 00:43:15.646
was the lands of the dead,

1144
00:43:15.646 --> 00:43:17.206
the lands of the specters, the lands of the ghouls.

1145
00:43:17.206 --> 00:43:20.806
So our race memory's filled with this

1146
00:43:20.806 --> 00:43:24.426
and unfortunately a antipathy to nature itself

1147
00:43:24.426 --> 00:43:26.156
came with that package.

1148
00:43:26.626 --> 00:43:28.606
We are so young, that was only,

1149
00:43:28.606 --> 00:43:31.496
some people say 50 or 13,000,

1150
00:43:31.646 --> 00:43:33.186
depends on who you're listening to

1151
00:43:33.186 --> 00:43:35.316
but even if it was 50,000 years ago

1152
00:43:35.326 --> 00:43:36.826
that's a blink of the eye, historically.

1153
00:43:36.826 --> 00:43:39.626
So we are not even in the beginning of the recovery

1154
00:43:39.626 --> 00:43:42.676
of that, to that trauma.

1155
00:43:43.126 --> 00:43:44.586
Meaning that the mysterium's wound,

1156
00:43:44.586 --> 00:43:46.686
the wound that created the mysterium

1157
00:43:46.686 --> 00:43:49.816
and the ego is very raw.

1158
00:43:51.486 --> 00:43:53.006
The growth of technology comes out of that,

1159
00:43:53.006 --> 00:43:57.106
the denigration of the family, the denigration of nature's

1160
00:43:57.106 --> 00:43:59.346
all a product of all of this.

1161
00:43:59.346 --> 00:44:00.606
<v Voiceover>And an attempt to control</v>

1162
00:44:00.606 --> 00:44:02.476
our consciousness, so to speak.

1163
00:44:02.626 --> 00:44:03.726
<v ->Yeah, that's what it is</v>

1164
00:44:03.726 --> 00:44:05.386
because it's fear and fear creates defenses.

1165
00:44:05.386 --> 00:44:06.786
<v Voiceover>Yes, and fear of the wildness</v>

1166
00:44:06.786 --> 00:44:08.276
of the natural law.

1167
00:44:08.486 --> 00:44:09.606
<v ->Right, inner anxiety.</v>

1168
00:44:09.606 --> 00:44:11.326
<v Voiceover>And by extension of that</v>

1169
00:44:11.326 --> 00:44:12.546
as we started the conversation,

1170
00:44:12.546 --> 00:44:14.446
the feminine aspect of ourselves

1171
00:44:14.446 --> 00:44:17.346
represents that same regenerative wildness

1172
00:44:17.346 --> 00:44:19.316
that there's a need to control.

1173
00:44:19.386 --> 00:44:20.546
<v ->That's right, the feminine so called</v>

1174
00:44:20.546 --> 00:44:22.606
is the only part of us, that remnant that's left.

1175
00:44:22.606 --> 00:44:24.146
It makes the artist, it makes the poets,

1176
00:44:24.146 --> 00:44:26.056
it makes the musicians.

1177
00:44:26.206 --> 00:44:27.926
They're are the ones who live on that little twilight zone,

1178
00:44:27.926 --> 00:44:31.546
the ones like Roger Waters and the Wall said,

1179
00:44:31.546 --> 00:44:32.866
they stand near the wall,

1180
00:44:32.866 --> 00:44:35.136
they're the little artistes, you know.

1181
00:44:35.346 --> 00:44:39.146
There are those few who are still sort of ambivalent

1182
00:44:39.146 --> 00:44:41.876
and their sensitive and eccentric and all of that.

1183
00:44:44.486 --> 00:44:48.346
To answer your question of whether I'm optimistic or not,

1184
00:44:48.346 --> 00:44:53.056
is this, yes, because we are in the process of healing.

1185
00:44:54.026 --> 00:44:55.386
We have serious forces

1186
00:44:55.386 --> 00:44:56.926
that don't want that healing to take place

1187
00:44:56.926 --> 00:45:01.656
but given time and time has it's cycles,

1188
00:45:02.526 --> 00:45:05.596
the 2012 is an expression of one right of passage,

1189
00:45:05.766 --> 00:45:07.106
leading to another, you see,

1190
00:45:07.106 --> 00:45:08.466
just like there's another one

1191
00:45:08.466 --> 00:45:10.376
of these various astrological periods.

1192
00:45:10.546 --> 00:45:12.146
These are cusp points,

1193
00:45:12.146 --> 00:45:13.486
the one that's happening now is global

1194
00:45:13.486 --> 00:45:14.626
and it's very powerful

1195
00:45:14.626 --> 00:45:16.286
because Pluto is directly involved in it

1196
00:45:16.286 --> 00:45:17.876
as is the sun.

1197
00:45:17.946 --> 00:45:20.086
They know this so they denigrated it recently, Pluto,

1198
00:45:20.086 --> 00:45:21.967
to some rock floating in space.

1199
00:45:21.967 --> 00:45:23.146
<v Voiceover>Yes, I noticed that.</v>

1200
00:45:23.146 --> 00:45:24.606
<v ->What planet are we on?</v>

1201
00:45:24.606 --> 00:45:25.526
(laughing)

1202
00:45:25.526 --> 00:45:27.166
<v Voiceover>Demote the planet if it gives you trouble.</v>

1203
00:45:27.166 --> 00:45:28.446
<v ->There's a song by Black Sabbath that said,</v>

1204
00:45:28.446 --> 00:45:29.426
"They'll tell you black is really white,

1205
00:45:29.426 --> 00:45:30.586
"the moon is just the sun at night."

1206
00:45:30.586 --> 00:45:32.486
Tomorrow they'll be telling us the sun,

1207
00:45:32.486 --> 00:45:33.916
it's the moon, right.

1208
00:45:34.046 --> 00:45:35.766
<v Voiceover>That was funny actually, yeah.</v>

1209
00:45:35.766 --> 00:45:37.786
<v ->But that's an art living, an art</v>

1210
00:45:37.786 --> 00:45:42.786
expression of this fear of the plutonic, here.

1211
00:45:44.686 --> 00:45:46.086
Oh, I have no unconscious, I've got no dirt,

1212
00:45:46.086 --> 00:45:47.346
there's no skeletons in my closet,

1213
00:45:47.346 --> 00:45:49.076
forget it psychology's not important.

1214
00:45:49.106 --> 00:45:51.406
But you heard it in that version, you know

1215
00:45:51.406 --> 00:45:52.966
to say Pluto, Pluto's Shiva

1216
00:45:52.966 --> 00:45:54.546
and you're gonna meet Shiva

1217
00:45:54.546 --> 00:45:56.066
because Shakti's protected

1218
00:45:56.066 --> 00:45:58.146
and there's rights and rituals to go through

1219
00:45:58.146 --> 00:45:59.606
before you enter that.

1220
00:45:59.606 --> 00:46:01.326
Study all the mythology, study the Arthurian legend,

1221
00:46:01.326 --> 00:46:04.896
study the Finn cycle, study the Zen, the trials.

1222
00:46:05.486 --> 00:46:06.766
We get it easy today,

1223
00:46:06.766 --> 00:46:08.686
study all the rites of passage that the neophyte

1224
00:46:08.686 --> 00:46:10.006
needed to go through

1225
00:46:10.006 --> 00:46:12.656
before you could even have one modicum of it.

1226
00:46:14.286 --> 00:46:15.966
Right, I mean the bards had to memorize

1227
00:46:15.966 --> 00:46:19.766
1,000s of pieces of poetry and history and lineage

1228
00:46:19.766 --> 00:46:24.066
to perfection, including the pauses of how you pause

1229
00:46:24.066 --> 00:46:25.856
between the sentences.

1230
00:46:26.106 --> 00:46:28.046
They had to play the harp until their fingers bled.

1231
00:46:28.046 --> 00:46:29.766
They had to know the tree, plant the tree,

1232
00:46:29.766 --> 00:46:33.216
nurture the tree and cut the wood that made the harp.

1233
00:46:33.526 --> 00:46:34.666
They had to tune the harp

1234
00:46:34.666 --> 00:46:36.816
according to the Hertzian frequencies of the planets.

1235
00:46:37.706 --> 00:46:39.186
<v Voiceover>And what do we have to do?</v>

1236
00:46:39.186 --> 00:46:40.626
<v ->We buy it on eBay,
(laughing)

1237
00:46:40.626 --> 00:46:44.076
we buy it from Taiwan, ready made.

1238
00:46:44.406 --> 00:46:45.446
<v Voiceover>But what did we give up</v>

1239
00:46:45.446 --> 00:46:47.056
that they gained in that process?

1240
00:46:47.506 --> 00:46:49.286
<v ->We lost our connection to nature</v>

1241
00:46:49.286 --> 00:46:51.166
and we lost the fact that death is in life.

1242
00:46:51.166 --> 00:46:53.226
See when you have direct participation

1243
00:46:53.226 --> 00:46:54.806
in any thing creative you die

1244
00:46:54.806 --> 00:46:56.336
as well as be born.

1245
00:46:56.546 --> 00:46:57.726
You can't be fooled by some priest

1246
00:46:57.726 --> 00:46:59.686
who's promising you a bromide after you're dead,

1247
00:46:59.686 --> 00:47:02.096
within the space of a breath you've died.

1248
00:47:02.506 --> 00:47:04.776
The breath, you die, you're reborn again.

1249
00:47:05.166 --> 00:47:07.526
When you have an intimate, like farmers,

1250
00:47:07.526 --> 00:47:09.186
anyone connected to the sun, the women,

1251
00:47:09.186 --> 00:47:11.846
everyone connected to the cycle of nature

1252
00:47:11.846 --> 00:47:13.906
is intimately aware that life and death

1253
00:47:13.906 --> 00:47:15.856
is in every breath and every moment.

1254
00:47:16.006 --> 00:47:17.246
We live in the simulacra

1255
00:47:17.246 --> 00:47:18.406
where death is just something

1256
00:47:18.406 --> 00:47:19.546
we don't even need to think about,

1257
00:47:19.546 --> 00:47:20.846
it's not with us anymore.

1258
00:47:20.846 --> 00:47:24.606
Just watch, you know, Judge Dredd or Demolition Man

1259
00:47:24.606 --> 00:47:27.426
or Equilibrium, is to you know,

1260
00:47:27.426 --> 00:47:28.886
I don't want to think those evil thoughts,

1261
00:47:28.886 --> 00:47:30.166
give me something to take,

1262
00:47:30.166 --> 00:47:31.966
give me an injection, I feel bad today.

1263
00:47:31.966 --> 00:47:35.126
You know that George Lucas movie,

1264
00:47:35.126 --> 00:47:38.806
it was Francis Ford Coppola, THX 1138, right.

1265
00:47:38.806 --> 00:47:40.826
I feel bad, I'm not feeling good today--

1266
00:47:40.826 --> 00:47:42.126
<v Voiceover>give me a drug.</v>

1267
00:47:42.126 --> 00:47:43.586
<v ->Give me more drugs.</v>

1268
00:47:43.586 --> 00:47:44.497
These darker emotions,

1269
00:47:44.497 --> 00:47:47.617
it's been a mass of psychology and misrepresentation,

1270
00:47:47.617 --> 00:47:49.397
even the words anger and violence

1271
00:47:49.397 --> 00:47:51.317
have all been misinterpreted to us, misinformed,

1272
00:47:51.317 --> 00:47:55.137
misapplied by psychopaths who themselves

1273
00:47:55.137 --> 00:47:57.257
can't go there, never will, never.

1274
00:47:57.257 --> 00:47:59.277
And if I may, I'll give you a small anecdote of why,

1275
00:47:59.277 --> 00:48:02.357
sociopaths are known historically to never change

1276
00:48:02.357 --> 00:48:06.077
because in order to change

1277
00:48:06.077 --> 00:48:08.137
they will have to visit all the pain an d suffering

1278
00:48:08.137 --> 00:48:10.257
that they've caused to every single individual

1279
00:48:10.257 --> 00:48:11.897
that they've harmed.

1280
00:48:11.897 --> 00:48:13.557
Do you remember in certain mystical traditions

1281
00:48:13.557 --> 00:48:15.357
they even make it a rule that you go back

1282
00:48:15.357 --> 00:48:17.127
and say sorry to the people that you've hurt,

1283
00:48:17.177 --> 00:48:18.617
it's based on this, whether it's good or bad

1284
00:48:18.617 --> 00:48:20.017
we can argue later.

1285
00:48:20.017 --> 00:48:21.577
The idea is that the sociopath

1286
00:48:21.577 --> 00:48:23.337
will feel in the dead of night,

1287
00:48:23.337 --> 00:48:26.177
after many years of psychology, or whatever,

1288
00:48:26.177 --> 00:48:29.357
even two seconds of revelation in their car one day.

1289
00:48:29.357 --> 00:48:30.977
I don't know what the scenario might be,

1290
00:48:30.977 --> 00:48:33.997
but the sociopath to change his sociopaths ways

1291
00:48:33.997 --> 00:48:36.357
would have to, it's not negotiable,

1292
00:48:36.357 --> 00:48:38.597
they would have to visit all the suffering

1293
00:48:38.597 --> 00:48:40.238
they've caused to everyone

1294
00:48:40.238 --> 00:48:42.497
that they have maliciously hurt and deceived

1295
00:48:42.497 --> 00:48:43.977
throughout their whole life.

1296
00:48:43.977 --> 00:48:47.397
Obviously impossible, it never happens.

1297
00:48:47.397 --> 00:48:49.097
<v Voiceover>Tedious process and one that mathematically</v>

1298
00:48:49.097 --> 00:48:51.307
that odds are they're not going to do that.

1299
00:48:51.377 --> 00:48:52.477
<v ->Right, so when we know that</v>

1300
00:48:52.477 --> 00:48:53.997
we understand why they stay the way they are,

1301
00:48:53.997 --> 00:48:55.337
it's too painful.

1302
00:48:55.337 --> 00:48:58.557
Now the more aware person is willing to go through it.

1303
00:48:58.557 --> 00:49:01.237
William Blake said how can we have gone through hell

1304
00:49:01.237 --> 00:49:03.507
and emerged unconsumed, right?

1305
00:49:03.657 --> 00:49:05.977
The shaman knows, he has to go through that hell of hells

1306
00:49:05.977 --> 00:49:07.897
and if you watch the movie, Hell Boy,

1307
00:49:07.897 --> 00:49:09.877
there's always our chemical traditions in this.

1308
00:49:09.877 --> 00:49:13.517
V for Vendetta where he purposely puts the girl

1309
00:49:13.517 --> 00:49:15.238
into the shadow gallery

1310
00:49:15.238 --> 00:49:17.417
and puts her through this unbelievably painful,

1311
00:49:17.417 --> 00:49:18.877
deathly, morbid experience

1312
00:49:18.877 --> 00:49:21.117
so she can be liberated and reinitiated into her,

1313
00:49:21.117 --> 00:49:22.757
because there's that grey area again,

1314
00:49:22.757 --> 00:49:25.177
you're not going to get it until you meet V or Shiva

1315
00:49:25.177 --> 00:49:27.457
or the world or yourself

1316
00:49:27.457 --> 00:49:30.847
or in my tradition it's Herne, Cernunnos, right.

1317
00:49:31.017 --> 00:49:32.357
In every tradition we have this being, Merlin,

1318
00:49:32.357 --> 00:49:34.037
I don't know who it might be.

1319
00:49:34.037 --> 00:49:36.697
You're gonna meet the shaman,

1320
00:49:36.697 --> 00:49:38.117
you're gonna meet that guy

1321
00:49:38.117 --> 00:49:40.797
who's gonna lead you through that gate.

1322
00:49:40.797 --> 00:49:43.917
And even that gate is still a metaphor for something

1323
00:49:43.917 --> 00:49:46.157
that happens biologically and so forth and so on.

1324
00:49:46.157 --> 00:49:48.077
But until you go through that divorce

1325
00:49:48.077 --> 00:49:49.597
nothing will change.

1326
00:49:49.597 --> 00:49:51.617
Now the only thing that makes a difference now

1327
00:49:51.617 --> 00:49:54.477
is that instead of this being some little private thing

1328
00:49:54.477 --> 00:49:56.177
that you're doing in your life with your teacher,

1329
00:49:56.177 --> 00:49:59.138
the whole world is having to go through this now.

1330
00:49:59.138 --> 00:50:00.377
<v Voiceover>It's moving</v>

1331
00:50:00.377 --> 00:50:01.577
all through the surface of humanity.

1332
00:50:01.577 --> 00:50:02.797
<v ->Right so the whole planet</v>

1333
00:50:02.797 --> 00:50:05.827
is being given this sort of opportunity

1334
00:50:05.877 --> 00:50:08.277
to go through this or at least some stage of it,

1335
00:50:08.277 --> 00:50:09.938
I never rule out the individual work,

1336
00:50:09.938 --> 00:50:11.517
you will always have to do it individually.

1337
00:50:11.517 --> 00:50:13.357
But many of the levels

1338
00:50:13.357 --> 00:50:14.738
and maybe we should be thankful for that even,

1339
00:50:14.738 --> 00:50:16.037
there's something weird about that,

1340
00:50:16.037 --> 00:50:18.397
maybe it's because the planet Uranus energy is,

1341
00:50:18.397 --> 00:50:20.647
Uranus rules groups.

1342
00:50:20.657 --> 00:50:22.418
So where there's Uranian energy

1343
00:50:22.418 --> 00:50:26.287
there will be a collectivism, with a small c, movement.

1344
00:50:26.837 --> 00:50:28.697
I think that these conferences are very much part of that.

1345
00:50:28.697 --> 00:50:30.297
<v Voiceover>Yes, and well if it can support the individual</v>

1346
00:50:30.297 --> 00:50:35.287
going through this experience, yeah.

1347
00:50:35.717 --> 00:50:37.917
<v ->Yes, so I think there's that,</v>

1348
00:50:37.917 --> 00:50:40.117
there are certain protections and help

1349
00:50:40.117 --> 00:50:41.597
and guidelines.

1350
00:50:41.597 --> 00:50:43.658
But remember the doctor doesn't get into bed with a patient,

1351
00:50:43.658 --> 00:50:46.418
the person who shows you the map

1352
00:50:46.418 --> 00:50:48.338
can't walk the landscape for you.

1353
00:50:48.338 --> 00:50:49.857
And that's the beauty, that's the journey.

1354
00:50:49.857 --> 00:50:52.737
So as the psychologists said

1355
00:50:52.737 --> 00:50:55.658
it will mean a reintegration with the unconscious mind,

1356
00:50:55.658 --> 00:50:57.127
they're right.

1357
00:50:57.197 --> 00:51:00.087
It will mean a re-understanding of what the ego is.

1358
00:51:00.537 --> 00:51:03.657
It will mean a re-visioning of what masculinity

1359
00:51:03.657 --> 00:51:05.847
and femininity is, in it's purest sense.

1360
00:51:06.218 --> 00:51:07.927
That's not the same as male and female.

1361
00:51:08.138 --> 00:51:10.247
It will mean a falling in love with the word no,

1362
00:51:10.257 --> 00:51:13.347
it's my favorite word, it has so much power, right.

1363
00:51:13.898 --> 00:51:17.687
It also means discovering that death is in life,

1364
00:51:18.057 --> 00:51:19.487
every second, every minute

1365
00:51:19.637 --> 00:51:21.927
and embrace it, love it, love it's action on your life.

1366
00:51:22.457 --> 00:51:23.577
By the way, it's gonna happen to you

1367
00:51:23.577 --> 00:51:24.497
whether you like it or not.

1368
00:51:24.497 --> 00:51:25.617
You can resist it as much as you want

1369
00:51:25.617 --> 00:51:26.677
and then you'll have the cancers

1370
00:51:26.677 --> 00:51:29.437
and then you'll have the other, harder permutations of it

1371
00:51:29.437 --> 00:51:30.997
until you learn to go with it.

1372
00:51:30.997 --> 00:51:33.177
Remember the very final scenes in the movie Dune,

1373
00:51:33.177 --> 00:51:34.837
by Frank, well Frank Herbert wrote the book

1374
00:51:34.837 --> 00:51:36.337
but they made the movie?

1375
00:51:36.337 --> 00:51:37.217
<v Voiceover>Uh huh.</v>

1376
00:51:37.217 --> 00:51:38.677
The very last scene is iconic for me

1377
00:51:38.677 --> 00:51:40.777
because just as the Sting character

1378
00:51:40.777 --> 00:51:43.977
is about to knife the prince you hear his voice saying,

1379
00:51:43.977 --> 00:51:46.167
"and I shall bend like a reed in the wind."

1380
00:51:46.317 --> 00:51:48.017
And immediately there's this Bruce Lee's zip,

1381
00:51:48.017 --> 00:51:52.087
right, flip and whoom, just like magic he turns it around.

1382
00:51:53.157 --> 00:51:54.837
And that's that mutability and flexibility

1383
00:51:54.837 --> 00:51:57.617
and sort of an Taoist, Zen way,

1384
00:51:57.617 --> 00:52:00.697
the Hopis say let go of the banks of the river,

1385
00:52:00.697 --> 00:52:02.117
it's alright.

1386
00:52:02.117 --> 00:52:03.757
Let go of the oars, the boat knows where it's going

1387
00:52:03.757 --> 00:52:05.677
and certainly the river knows where's it's going.

1388
00:52:05.677 --> 00:52:06.717
<v Voiceover>I love that saying.</v>

1389
00:52:06.717 --> 00:52:08.457
<v ->We spoke about this before, right.</v>

1390
00:52:08.457 --> 00:52:10.117
So this is the challenge that people need to let go.

1391
00:52:10.117 --> 00:52:12.177
My message to them is when you realize it's a lie

1392
00:52:12.177 --> 00:52:13.767
it's easy to let go.

1393
00:52:13.837 --> 00:52:14.797
If you offer the monkey,

1394
00:52:14.797 --> 00:52:16.157
you know cause in India the monkeys,

1395
00:52:16.157 --> 00:52:17.677
they come and they try to put their hand

1396
00:52:17.677 --> 00:52:18.977
in the clay pots to grab the food

1397
00:52:18.977 --> 00:52:20.717
and they're so greedy that even when people

1398
00:52:20.717 --> 00:52:22.677
are beating them with sticks they won't let go.

1399
00:52:22.677 --> 00:52:25.137
They'll just hang on, no matter how many--

1400
00:52:25.137 --> 00:52:26.477
<v Voiceover>Right, and their fists can't make it</v>

1401
00:52:26.477 --> 00:52:27.377
back through the hole.

1402
00:52:27.377 --> 00:52:29.077
<v ->When you bring a bunch of more gooey looking sweets</v>

1403
00:52:29.077 --> 00:52:31.887
the hand releases immediately and it goes for the thing.

1404
00:52:32.297 --> 00:52:34.037
That's all it is, realize that you

1405
00:52:34.037 --> 00:52:36.737
are holding onto to something that

1406
00:52:36.737 --> 00:52:38.407
is absolutely rotten.

1407
00:52:38.497 --> 00:52:40.357
It's again in the movie, Dune,

1408
00:52:40.357 --> 00:52:42.717
where the priestess, the sorceress

1409
00:52:42.717 --> 00:52:46.127
makes the prince put his hand in the fear box,

1410
00:52:47.717 --> 00:52:49.057
you know to scare the bejesus out of him

1411
00:52:49.057 --> 00:52:50.477
and it's all in the head. right?

1412
00:52:50.477 --> 00:52:51.417
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

1413
00:52:51.417 --> 00:52:55.007
So when we realize that what we're avoiding

1414
00:52:55.177 --> 00:52:57.117
is self-food, which is golden, which is wonderful,

1415
00:52:57.117 --> 00:52:58.877
which is who you are and who you're meant to be

1416
00:52:58.877 --> 00:53:01.197
the hand will release from the false.

1417
00:53:01.197 --> 00:53:03.687
But trying to jack-boot it out,

1418
00:53:03.797 --> 00:53:06.197
philosophize it out, cajole people,

1419
00:53:06.197 --> 00:53:09.507
that will never work

1420
00:53:09.617 --> 00:53:11.837
because that's not the way the hard-wiring is.

1421
00:53:11.837 --> 00:53:13.697
You offer something better, detach from this--

1422
00:53:13.697 --> 00:53:15.017
<v Voiceover>The gooey plate of sweets.</v>

1423
00:53:15.017 --> 00:53:16.257
<v ->Yeah, the gooey plate of sweets</v>

1424
00:53:16.257 --> 00:53:18.297
which is the self-food and it's Mytha,

1425
00:53:18.297 --> 00:53:21.317
in Indian they call it Mythi, Soma of a different kind,

1426
00:53:21.317 --> 00:53:22.987
the real thing, right?

1427
00:53:22.997 --> 00:53:24.237
<v Voiceover>Not renewal will come.</v>

1428
00:53:24.237 --> 00:53:25.677
<v ->And in the Vada's it's there,</v>

1429
00:53:25.677 --> 00:53:27.077
it's in the Vadas it's there, it's down under the tree

1430
00:53:27.077 --> 00:53:29.157
he finds himself and he finds that the rivers that flow

1431
00:53:29.157 --> 00:53:32.357
are his breath, the trees that grow are his eyes,

1432
00:53:32.357 --> 00:53:33.657
there's a whole metaphor

1433
00:53:33.657 --> 00:53:36.047
where he becomes one with everything around him.

1434
00:53:36.297 --> 00:53:37.417
And to use like Drumbalo,

1435
00:53:37.417 --> 00:53:42.417
Methusadex parlance, the marcaba, aura

1436
00:53:44.477 --> 00:53:47.917
is not your personal aura, nature herself

1437
00:53:47.917 --> 00:53:50.547
and all the universe is your personal aura.

1438
00:53:50.737 --> 00:53:52.207
You own it, it's you.

1439
00:53:52.837 --> 00:53:54.197
She belongs to you, you belong to it,

1440
00:53:54.197 --> 00:53:55.697
that's the symbiosis of chemical wedding.

1441
00:53:55.697 --> 00:53:57.637
When we realize that's where we're heading towards,

1442
00:53:57.637 --> 00:53:59.747
automatically you're Truman

1443
00:53:59.797 --> 00:54:01.657
and you just open the door in the sky

1444
00:54:01.657 --> 00:54:03.507
and go, take it easy guys,

1445
00:54:03.617 --> 00:54:05.737
you know your control doesn't work anymore

1446
00:54:05.737 --> 00:54:07.527
because I've been immune.

1447
00:54:07.557 --> 00:54:09.817
I'm immune now to every element of the control,

1448
00:54:09.817 --> 00:54:11.607
you can't control me because I'm immune.

1449
00:54:11.817 --> 00:54:12.837
Bruce Lee would say,

1450
00:54:12.837 --> 00:54:15.177
"When I become so invulnerable to your kicks, I've won."

1451
00:54:15.177 --> 00:54:16.797
It's a principle of Aikido,

1452
00:54:16.797 --> 00:54:18.317
it's the principle of Ji Kun Do,

1453
00:54:18.317 --> 00:54:20.358
you become so immune to the virus

1454
00:54:20.358 --> 00:54:22.357
that the virus dies of it's own thing.

1455
00:54:22.357 --> 00:54:24.117
The parasite drops off because there's no power over you.

1456
00:54:24.117 --> 00:54:26.467
Fighting the virus is exactly what the virus wants.

1457
00:54:26.537 --> 00:54:27.657
Remember in Fifth Element

1458
00:54:27.657 --> 00:54:28.837
the more you shoot at the star,

1459
00:54:28.837 --> 00:54:30.078
the bigger it becomes.

1460
00:54:30.078 --> 00:54:32.118
They're telling us this, the more you,

1461
00:54:32.118 --> 00:54:34.657
in Zardoz, the beast we've conjured in our midst,

1462
00:54:34.657 --> 00:54:37.367
why did we conjure the beast in our midst?

1463
00:54:37.717 --> 00:54:39.777
Instead of fighting it, you ask why did it get created.

1464
00:54:39.777 --> 00:54:41.917
<v Voiceover>So let go of the banks, let go of the reeds</v>

1465
00:54:41.917 --> 00:54:43.867
on the banks, let the river take us.

1466
00:54:43.917 --> 00:54:45.217
<v ->Yeah, right and not everyone can do that.</v>

1467
00:54:45.217 --> 00:54:47.958
I'm no, I'm not the fool, I'm a realist,

1468
00:54:47.958 --> 00:54:49.977
a lot of people can't do that.

1469
00:54:49.977 --> 00:54:51.737
My advice is don't try to save them

1470
00:54:51.737 --> 00:54:53.257
because you'll be dragged down with them.

1471
00:54:53.257 --> 00:54:54.997
I really mean this, I know it's horrible to say

1472
00:54:54.997 --> 00:54:56.077
and people don't like it.

1473
00:54:56.077 --> 00:54:57.117
<v Voiceover>No, it's true.</v>

1474
00:54:57.117 --> 00:54:58.837
<v ->It's not gonna become a living fact</v>

1475
00:54:58.837 --> 00:55:00.717
because the vampiristic kind of person

1476
00:55:00.717 --> 00:55:02.297
who's not done their homework, spiritually,

1477
00:55:02.297 --> 00:55:04.077
meaning sociopathic kind of creature,

1478
00:55:04.077 --> 00:55:06.257
the first thing they're gonna grab onto you

1479
00:55:06.257 --> 00:55:08.197
like a Klingon on Captain Kirk's foot,

1480
00:55:08.197 --> 00:55:12.147
dragging him into the abyss along with himself.

1481
00:55:12.317 --> 00:55:13.557
<v Voiceover>And going back to women,</v>

1482
00:55:13.557 --> 00:55:15.337
we can be really bad at trying to pick up anybody

1483
00:55:15.337 --> 00:55:16.497
that needs that.

1484
00:55:16.497 --> 00:55:17.437
<v ->Everybody can be.</v>

1485
00:55:17.437 --> 00:55:18.617
<v Voiceover>Everybody can be,</v>

1486
00:55:18.617 --> 00:55:19.717
so we don't need to be doing that.

1487
00:55:19.717 --> 00:55:20.917
I'm really clear on that it took a few years

1488
00:55:20.917 --> 00:55:22.657
to really get it, but I get now,

1489
00:55:22.657 --> 00:55:24.397
there have been enough signs,

1490
00:55:24.397 --> 00:55:27.477
there's been enough energy to move us in this direction

1491
00:55:27.477 --> 00:55:29.937
that we need to understand it's up to us.

1492
00:55:29.937 --> 00:55:31.877
We really need to in essence

1493
00:55:31.877 --> 00:55:34.467
transform ourselves first, right?

1494
00:55:34.637 --> 00:55:35.497
That's it.

1495
00:55:35.497 --> 00:55:36.797
<v ->Yeah, but to do that</v>

1496
00:55:36.797 --> 00:55:38.757
there's a divorce required to dispense

1497
00:55:38.757 --> 00:55:40.697
with other teachers in the heart-sense,

1498
00:55:40.697 --> 00:55:42.977
they're only guides and remember

1499
00:55:42.977 --> 00:55:44.257
what they speak is their truth.

1500
00:55:44.257 --> 00:55:45.677
No matter how holy it sounds

1501
00:55:45.677 --> 00:55:46.877
or how demonic it sounds,

1502
00:55:46.877 --> 00:55:50.207
one thing you must know it's their reality.

1503
00:55:50.937 --> 00:55:52.097
They're speaking for themselves,

1504
00:55:52.097 --> 00:55:55.707
they are guides, but they can't walk the topography for you,

1505
00:55:55.977 --> 00:55:57.697
you must do the adventure yourself.

1506
00:55:57.697 --> 00:55:59.817
And as Professor Tolkien showed in his masterwork,

1507
00:55:59.817 --> 00:56:03.687
even the lowest rung of the ladder,

1508
00:56:03.697 --> 00:56:05.887
the most insignificant person,

1509
00:56:06.717 --> 00:56:09.287
can do what the highest sorcerer's and wizards cannot do.

1510
00:56:09.797 --> 00:56:11.197
So it was a metaphor

1511
00:56:11.197 --> 00:56:14.247
and he was saying don't beat yourself up.

1512
00:56:14.737 --> 00:56:17.017
Realize that, because remember in the story,

1513
00:56:17.017 --> 00:56:18.517
when they're chosen to carry the ring

1514
00:56:18.517 --> 00:56:19.857
they can't believe it.

1515
00:56:19.857 --> 00:56:21.157
They're thinking there's a mistake here,

1516
00:56:21.157 --> 00:56:22.577
you got the wrong phone number here.

1517
00:56:22.577 --> 00:56:27.577
Yet, he's saying no, no, you are the little ones

1518
00:56:28.057 --> 00:56:29.277
who can get through.

1519
00:56:29.277 --> 00:56:30.837
So it's a very complex metaphor

1520
00:56:30.837 --> 00:56:32.337
but it really represents the fact

1521
00:56:32.337 --> 00:56:34.377
that the lowest person in society

1522
00:56:34.377 --> 00:56:35.977
as long as they realize who they are,

1523
00:56:35.977 --> 00:56:39.277
their journey is also a realization that,

1524
00:56:39.277 --> 00:56:41.357
remember because I've said in all my work,

1525
00:56:41.357 --> 00:56:43.797
do not think that this is something external to you.

1526
00:56:43.797 --> 00:56:46.077
All these challenges and obstacles that come up

1527
00:56:46.077 --> 00:56:48.507
are there because it's part of your journey.

1528
00:56:48.597 --> 00:56:50.437
It's not like, oh I didn't realize this was happening to me,

1529
00:56:50.437 --> 00:56:51.937
I've just learned that there's a big brother

1530
00:56:51.937 --> 00:56:53.617
operating in the world, what am I gonna do about it?

1531
00:56:53.617 --> 00:56:55.697
It's not an external activity,

1532
00:56:55.697 --> 00:56:57.547
divorced from your personal life.

1533
00:56:58.137 --> 00:56:59.317
Oh boy, I wish I could change the channel.

1534
00:56:59.317 --> 00:57:01.827
This is your spiritual life,

1535
00:57:02.757 --> 00:57:04.777
this is the matrix of control into which you were born,

1536
00:57:04.777 --> 00:57:07.277
you're to find the answer to that Gordian knot

1537
00:57:07.277 --> 00:57:09.197
you're to break the matrix if you can

1538
00:57:09.197 --> 00:57:12.587
and instead of, my message is,

1539
00:57:12.677 --> 00:57:14.917
instead of going outward you must turn within.

1540
00:57:14.917 --> 00:57:16.177
That's where the secret is,

1541
00:57:16.177 --> 00:57:18.418
it's within your own self that the secret lies.

1542
00:57:18.418 --> 00:57:22.357
<v Voiceover>Michael, this wasn't the conversation</v>

1543
00:57:22.357 --> 00:57:24.517
I had anticipated happening with you

1544
00:57:24.517 --> 00:57:26.137
when we first met a couple days ago

1545
00:57:26.137 --> 00:57:30.247
but I am thrilled because this has been beautiful.

1546
00:57:30.337 --> 00:57:34.107
<v ->Thank you. Always good to talk to you.</v>

1547
00:57:34.357 --> 00:57:35.677
<v Voiceover>And vice a versa.</v>

1548
00:57:35.677 --> 00:57:36.837
<v ->Thanks to you.</v>

1549
00:57:36.837 --> 00:57:40.557
<v ->For more of Michael's work you can go to tarotscope.com</v>

1550
00:57:40.557 --> 00:57:43.317
for his vast array of knowledge on esoteric subjects

1551
00:57:43.317 --> 00:57:46.217
from occult astrology to defining the dynamics

1552
00:57:46.217 --> 00:57:48.397
behind the architects of control.

1553
00:57:48.397 --> 00:57:50.377
You might also want to watch our previous interviews

1554
00:57:50.377 --> 00:57:53.307
with him on the Irish Origins of Civilization.

1555
00:57:53.578 --> 00:57:56.417
To continue looking into the re-emergence of the feminine,

1556
00:57:56.417 --> 00:57:59.098
you might also enjoy my interviews with Dr. Christine Page

1557
00:57:59.098 --> 00:58:02.317
and Lucia Rene on unplugging the patriarchy.

1558
00:58:02.317 --> 00:58:05.407
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1559
00:58:08.897 --> 00:58:09.807
(mellow Celtic music)
