00:00:00.565 --> 00:00:03.903
<v ->Glenda Green is an author and artist and an alchemist.</v>

2
00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:06.522
Her passion is the essence of the plant kingdom,

3
00:00:06.522 --> 00:00:08.474
sacred essential oils.

4
00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:10.129
For any of you who are looking to expand your

5
00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:12.609
consciousness beyond words and concepts,

6
00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:14.525
Glenda explains that the frequencies

7
00:00:14.525 --> 00:00:18.159
of essential oils can affect the body, mind, and spirit

8
00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:19.987
far beyond mental concepts

9
00:00:19.987 --> 00:00:21.920
and can create bridges of consciousness

10
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.405
between ourselves and others.

11
00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:29.115 line:15% 
(calm music)

12
00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:34.914
About 20 years ago when I first became aware

13
00:00:34.914 --> 00:00:37.557
of essential oils, it's almost as though you had to know

14
00:00:37.557 --> 00:00:39.798
a friend of a friend of a friend to find out

15
00:00:39.798 --> 00:00:41.298
where they were.

16
00:00:41.298 --> 00:00:45.257
Now, you go to the supermarket and it says

17
00:00:45.257 --> 00:00:48.552
essential oil blends in your hand soaps

18
00:00:48.552 --> 00:00:50.283
and dish washing liquids.

19
00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:53.513
But there's a very large distinction between

20
00:00:53.513 --> 00:00:57.613
what people think of as essential oils today

21
00:00:57.613 --> 00:01:00.297
in the commodities market compared to what's

22
00:01:00.297 --> 00:01:01.563
really going on.

23
00:01:01.563 --> 00:01:03.184
Can you talk about what's happened?

24
00:01:03.184 --> 00:01:05.383
Give us a little historical overview in the last

25
00:01:05.383 --> 00:01:06.993
couple of decades.

26
00:01:06.993 --> 00:01:08.722
<v ->Well, in the last couple of decades,</v>

27
00:01:08.722 --> 00:01:12.880
we have actually created a Renaissance

28
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.422
of what is a very ancient practice,

29
00:01:16.422 --> 00:01:21.422
possibly the oldest medicinal and inspirational practice

30
00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:23.048
of mankind.

31
00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:27.655
And that is our relationship to scent.

32
00:01:28.627 --> 00:01:33.004
We have a profound emotional, spiritual,

33
00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:35.878
and intuitive relationship to scent.

34
00:01:35.878 --> 00:01:38.869
In the earliest days of our human survival,

35
00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.958
it was our most powerful survival scent.

36
00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.021
We could smell changes in the weather,

37
00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:45.898
we could smell fires that were coming,

38
00:01:45.898 --> 00:01:48.360
we could smell the migration of animals,

39
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.918
we could smell the seasons,

40
00:01:49.918 --> 00:01:51.756
smell danger.

41
00:01:51.756 --> 00:01:55.172
And of course, we know that that scent is still very alive

42
00:01:55.172 --> 00:01:57.048
in the animal kingdom.

43
00:01:57.048 --> 00:01:59.376
But it's diminished to some degree

44
00:01:59.376 --> 00:02:03.783
not as much as is often said

45
00:02:03.783 --> 00:02:06.596
about humanity.

46
00:02:06.596 --> 00:02:09.970
We just simply don't use our sense of smell

47
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.560
for survival purposes anymore,

48
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.898
but it's very very powerful.

49
00:02:13.898 --> 00:02:18.896
It's possibly the most penetrating,

50
00:02:18.896 --> 00:02:22.557
intuitively influential sense we still have

51
00:02:22.557 --> 00:02:26.294
because it's our one sense other than sound

52
00:02:26.294 --> 00:02:30.623
that is received directly by the limbic

53
00:02:30.623 --> 00:02:32.952
autonomic nervous system

54
00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:36.086
and is unfiltered by the conscious mind.

55
00:02:36.086 --> 00:02:37.586
<v Voiceover>It's true it brings up</v>

56
00:02:37.586 --> 00:02:38.945
such immediate response.

57
00:02:38.945 --> 00:02:40.980
If you smell something and, my God,

58
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.945
that's something from my childhood,

59
00:02:42.945 --> 00:02:44.653
and you're immediately seeking this.

60
00:02:44.653 --> 00:02:45.506
Yes.

61
00:02:45.506 --> 00:02:46.615
<v ->That's right.</v>

62
00:02:46.615 --> 00:02:49.210
It could be a pleasurable experience

63
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.420
or it could be traumatic.

64
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.539
One of the other things we know is that

65
00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:57.114
the sense of smell is received by an organ in the brain

66
00:02:57.114 --> 00:03:02.114
called the amygdala that carries these waves of

67
00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:04.749
perceptual recognition directly to the

68
00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:09.471
autonomic nervous system but they are not stored there.

69
00:03:09.471 --> 00:03:13.482
These memories are actually stored in the cells of our body.

70
00:03:13.482 --> 00:03:16.162
This has been scientifically demonstrated.

71
00:03:17.425 --> 00:03:20.362
To the complete satisfaction of not only intuitives

72
00:03:20.362 --> 00:03:23.890
but scientist that it is in the cells of the body

73
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.790
where our memories are stored,

74
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.466
and most especially those memories of extreme joy or trauma

75
00:03:30.466 --> 00:03:33.789
that are carried by the autonomic nervous system

76
00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:36.992
as opposed to our conscious experiences

77
00:03:36.992 --> 00:03:40.817
that tend to be filed more in our conscious

78
00:03:40.817 --> 00:03:41.901
factories.
<v Voiceover>Our memory bank.</v>

79
00:03:41.901 --> 00:03:43.712
<v ->Our memory bank, yes.</v>

80
00:03:47.182 --> 00:03:51.903
Essential oils help us to access those memories.

81
00:03:51.903 --> 00:03:54.607
Another thing about essential oils is that they are

82
00:03:54.607 --> 00:03:57.945
the vital life force of the plant kingdom.

83
00:03:57.945 --> 00:04:00.236
And ancient men knew that.

84
00:04:00.236 --> 00:04:02.541
And so when ancient

85
00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.811
doctors and alchemists would turn to look

86
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:09.668
for some substance that could assist us

87
00:04:09.668 --> 00:04:12.681
in either our inspiration or our healing,

88
00:04:12.681 --> 00:04:16.752
they would look to this aspect of the plant kingdom.

89
00:04:16.752 --> 00:04:19.045
<v Voiceover>Which makes perfect sense.</v>

90
00:04:19.045 --> 00:04:21.515
And that we look to the plant kingdom

91
00:04:21.515 --> 00:04:24.603
to nourish our bodies physically and our digestive systems

92
00:04:24.603 --> 00:04:26.050
and for our nutrients,

93
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.239
why would we then eliminate the value

94
00:04:29.239 --> 00:04:32.811
or set aside the value of the scent that they produce?

95
00:04:32.811 --> 00:04:35.625
It's a holistic healing that's happening.

96
00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:37.257
<v ->It is the scent.</v>

97
00:04:37.257 --> 00:04:39.645
But I want to add something else to it also,

98
00:04:39.645 --> 00:04:44.049
and that is that the actual substance of an essential oil.

99
00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:48.307
We're used to seeing or we think of oils as

100
00:04:48.307 --> 00:04:50.624
either fatty substances, greasy substances

101
00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:52.702
or vegetable oils of some kind

102
00:04:52.702 --> 00:04:56.430
even if we're referring to the purest such as jojoba

103
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.113
or almonds.
<v Voiceover>What do you have</v>

104
00:04:57.113 --> 00:04:57.937
in your hand there?

105
00:04:57.937 --> 00:05:00.252
<v ->I have love.</v>

106
00:05:00.252 --> 00:05:01.606
<v Voiceover>Love (chuckles).</v>

107
00:05:01.606 --> 00:05:02.246
<v ->Yes.</v>

108
00:05:02.246 --> 00:05:03.558
<v Voiceover>Okay, and that's beautiful.</v>

109
00:05:03.558 --> 00:05:04.868
I have experienced all of them,

110
00:05:04.868 --> 00:05:06.951
they're absolutely incredible.

111
00:05:06.951 --> 00:05:07.864
<v ->Thank you.</v>

112
00:05:07.864 --> 00:05:08.977
<v ->Just such a frequency.</v>

113
00:05:08.977 --> 00:05:10.249
So let's talk, continue--

114
00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:13.619
<v ->But I wanted to say that this is a frequency,</v>

115
00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:16.659
that all essential oils are a frequency.

116
00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:18.893
And I'm gonna give you a scientific description of it,

117
00:05:18.893 --> 00:05:21.858
atomic molecular units or AMU.

118
00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:27.504
An oil is about a thousand, such as jojoba or almond,

119
00:05:27.504 --> 00:05:29.794
is about a thousand AMU.

120
00:05:29.794 --> 00:05:33.964
Essential oils are as small as 500 AMU.

121
00:05:33.964 --> 00:05:37.754
And a substance has to be smaller than 500 AMU

122
00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:40.423
to freely cross the blood brain barrier

123
00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:44.293
and also the other cellular barriers in the body.

124
00:05:44.293 --> 00:05:47.189
That means that one drop of essential oil

125
00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:52.031
can cover every cell in our body within minutes

126
00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:56.133
with 40,000 molecules.

127
00:05:56.133 --> 00:05:58.063
<v Voiceover>Amazing.</v>

128
00:05:58.063 --> 00:05:58.847
Amazing.

129
00:05:58.847 --> 00:05:59.566
The ability for it--

130
00:05:59.566 --> 00:06:00.502
<v ->It is amazing.</v>

131
00:06:00.502 --> 00:06:01.478
<v Voiceover>Permeate.</v>

132
00:06:01.478 --> 00:06:04.541
<v ->Yes, so it has a permeable quality</v>

133
00:06:04.541 --> 00:06:06.505
that other oils don't have.

134
00:06:06.505 --> 00:06:08.249
So it's not just scent,

135
00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:10.434
it's actually the substance.

136
00:06:10.434 --> 00:06:13.772
And in the plant kingdom this substance is the

137
00:06:13.772 --> 00:06:17.835
antibiotic, the antibacterial, and the

138
00:06:19.286 --> 00:06:21.598
carrier of,

139
00:06:24.714 --> 00:06:29.713
well, the healing essences that protect the plant.

140
00:06:29.713 --> 00:06:32.000
<v Voiceover>Right, they protect the plant's life itself.</v>

141
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.817
<v ->Correct.</v>

142
00:06:32.817 --> 00:06:33.355
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

143
00:06:33.355 --> 00:06:33.921
<v ->Correct.</v>

144
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:34.540
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

145
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.688
<v ->And also, more than that,</v>

146
00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:40.817
these essential oils instruct the plant's DNA.

147
00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:44.102
So they have a direct connection not only to the

148
00:06:44.102 --> 00:06:47.158
plant's DNA but they affect our DNA.

149
00:06:47.158 --> 00:06:50.656
We know that within the human body

150
00:06:50.656 --> 00:06:53.430
there are, well, an average size human body,

151
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.362
there are about

152
00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:59.759
100 million cells.

153
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:02.500
<v Voiceover>That's a lot of cells.</v>

154
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.249
<v ->That's a lot of cells.</v>

155
00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:03.906
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

156
00:07:03.906 --> 00:07:06.153
<v ->Each one of them has a strand of DNA.</v>

157
00:07:06.153 --> 00:07:07.022
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

158
00:07:07.022 --> 00:07:10.934
<v ->Each strand of DNA has about six gigabytes of memory.</v>

159
00:07:12.321 --> 00:07:14.285
Put your multiplication to that.

160
00:07:14.285 --> 00:07:15.222
<v Voiceover>I can't.</v>

161
00:07:15.222 --> 00:07:18.264
I at least have to have a pen and paper (chuckles).

162
00:07:18.264 --> 00:07:20.328
<v ->It's bigger than any computer in the world.</v>

163
00:07:20.328 --> 00:07:22.818
That's our capacity for memory.

164
00:07:22.818 --> 00:07:25.948
That's our capacity for perceptual storage.

165
00:07:25.948 --> 00:07:30.260
And essential oils are one of the few substances

166
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.232
small enough in molecular size to reach

167
00:07:33.232 --> 00:07:35.709
these strands of DNA,

168
00:07:35.709 --> 00:07:38.729
to inform them or reinform them,

169
00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:41.237
correct the information in it,

170
00:07:41.237 --> 00:07:43.920
eliminate or edit information in it,

171
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.437
or bring forth valuable information in it,

172
00:07:46.437 --> 00:07:48.417
whichever the case may be.

173
00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:52.362
So it's not just a scent,

174
00:07:52.362 --> 00:07:54.516
it's the substance as well.

175
00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:56.229
<v Voiceover>It's the information embedded,</v>

176
00:07:56.229 --> 00:07:58.239
encoded within the substance.

177
00:07:58.239 --> 00:08:01.358
And it can be, as you say,

178
00:08:01.358 --> 00:08:04.004
you can apply alchemy to the use of oils

179
00:08:04.004 --> 00:08:05.762
and the transformation of oils

180
00:08:05.762 --> 00:08:08.586
in addition to the information that is already encoded

181
00:08:08.586 --> 00:08:09.874
in them by nature.

182
00:08:09.874 --> 00:08:11.487
And I wanna get into that.

183
00:08:11.487 --> 00:08:14.501
Let's go back to the most ancient times.

184
00:08:14.501 --> 00:08:16.685
And we're beginning to understand even science

185
00:08:16.685 --> 00:08:20.759
is acknowledging that these were not primitive individuals

186
00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:22.048
far, far back in time.

187
00:08:22.048 --> 00:08:24.854
These people had very advanced knowledge of science,

188
00:08:24.854 --> 00:08:28.643
also of healing modalities, nature, et cetera, cosmos.

189
00:08:28.643 --> 00:08:30.771
So let's go back into some of the more sophisticated

190
00:08:30.771 --> 00:08:34.557
ancient cultures and see how they utilize the oils

191
00:08:34.557 --> 00:08:38.537
and some of the oils that were famed in that era.

192
00:08:38.537 --> 00:08:41.115
<v ->The oldest written manuscripts we have</v>

193
00:08:41.115 --> 00:08:43.503
about the oils are vedas.

194
00:08:43.503 --> 00:08:46.475
And the vedas really laid out the basics

195
00:08:46.475 --> 00:08:49.375
for ayurvedic medicine.

196
00:08:49.375 --> 00:08:51.251
And there were over,

197
00:08:52.964 --> 00:08:56.240
I believe there are over a hundred different

198
00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.634
fragrances mentioned in the vedas that were specifically

199
00:08:59.634 --> 00:09:04.634
used for medicinal or inspirational functions.

200
00:09:06.988 --> 00:09:09.658
We don't have any evidence that in the vedas,

201
00:09:09.658 --> 00:09:12.464
in that culture they were alchemically blended.

202
00:09:12.464 --> 00:09:15.017
But by the time of the Egyptian culture, they were.

203
00:09:15.017 --> 00:09:16.196
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

204
00:09:16.196 --> 00:09:20.061
<v ->And so the art of the alchemist had emerged.</v>

205
00:09:20.061 --> 00:09:22.161
One of the things that they discovered in

206
00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:26.052
ancient Egypt or even in pre,

207
00:09:26.052 --> 00:09:29.060
let's say, pre Egypt, Egypt.

208
00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.560
<v Voiceover>Pre-dynastic Egypt.</v>

209
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.309
<v ->Correct.</v>

210
00:09:31.309 --> 00:09:32.291
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

211
00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:35.476
<v ->I think that to some degree,</v>

212
00:09:35.476 --> 00:09:39.515
the body of wisdom is fairly,

213
00:09:39.515 --> 00:09:41.807
of dynastic Egypt, is fairly recent compared

214
00:09:41.807 --> 00:09:44.755
to the ancient wisdom that preceded it.

215
00:09:44.755 --> 00:09:47.147
By the time we have dynastic records,

216
00:09:47.147 --> 00:09:49.619
we know that the alchemists are already one of the

217
00:09:49.619 --> 00:09:54.619
most powerful influences in the culture.

218
00:09:54.703 --> 00:09:59.027
And they understood that by taking

219
00:09:59.027 --> 00:10:02.674
two or three substances, correctly blending them,

220
00:10:02.674 --> 00:10:06.717
not only do you have the value of one substance

221
00:10:06.717 --> 00:10:10.523
but they alchemically transform

222
00:10:10.523 --> 00:10:13.803
into a greater whole,

223
00:10:13.803 --> 00:10:18.201
into a greater substance that can carry a higher frequency.

224
00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:21.098
We know that the human body carries

225
00:10:21.098 --> 00:10:24.276
a particular megahertz frequency.

226
00:10:24.276 --> 00:10:26.781
It's between about 72 and 78

227
00:10:29.002 --> 00:10:32.289
megahertz units when it's healthy.

228
00:10:32.289 --> 00:10:34.946
And we can actually predict the onset of disease

229
00:10:34.946 --> 00:10:37.669
because the megahertz will drop.

230
00:10:37.669 --> 00:10:42.450
And the megahertz, to give you an example,

231
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.254
the megahertz of herbs is,

232
00:10:45.254 --> 00:10:49.512
well, the fresh herbs are not as high as the human frequency

233
00:10:49.512 --> 00:10:53.014
but the essential oils can go as high as

234
00:10:53.014 --> 00:10:56.624
10 million.

235
00:10:56.624 --> 00:10:58.311
<v Voiceover>Wow.</v>

236
00:10:58.311 --> 00:10:59.365
<v ->Megahertz.</v>

237
00:10:59.365 --> 00:11:00.509
<v Voiceover>Wow.</v>

238
00:11:00.509 --> 00:11:04.020
<v ->And when you take two or three substances</v>

239
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.440
that, let's say,

240
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.723
range from about, sandalwood

241
00:11:08.723 --> 00:11:11.221
what is a 1,200 megahertz frequency.

242
00:11:11.221 --> 00:11:14.123
We could take sandalwood and we could take

243
00:11:15.619 --> 00:11:19.975
rose and we could take frankincense and blend them.

244
00:11:19.975 --> 00:11:21.522
And we not only have,

245
00:11:21.522 --> 00:11:24.979
we don't get an average of frequencies,

246
00:11:24.979 --> 00:11:28.280
we get an acceleration of frequency

247
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.672
if they are correctly blended.

248
00:11:30.672 --> 00:11:34.341
And this is why the alchemists' blends

249
00:11:34.341 --> 00:11:37.833
were so sacredly guarded,

250
00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:41.031
because by taking the right blends of

251
00:11:41.031 --> 00:11:43.192
the essential elements,

252
00:11:43.192 --> 00:11:46.353
putting them together in the correct proportion,

253
00:11:46.353 --> 00:11:49.084
you could accelerate the frequency.

254
00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:52.356
And you could take it to such a very high

255
00:11:52.356 --> 00:11:57.356
megahertz frequency that just sensing it,

256
00:11:57.928 --> 00:12:01.065
not to mention putting it on your body,

257
00:12:01.065 --> 00:12:04.067
would cause a consciousness transformation.

258
00:12:05.067 --> 00:12:07.781
<v Voiceover>Right, and that's what I was referring to.</v>

259
00:12:07.781 --> 00:12:09.492
Can you talk about some of the ways in which

260
00:12:09.492 --> 00:12:11.860
it was used specifically in the ancient rituals

261
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.058
to bring about certain shifts of consciousness?

262
00:12:15.058 --> 00:12:19.065
It was essential to all levels of ordination.

263
00:12:19.065 --> 00:12:22.300
And I'm not limiting this to anyone's religious practice

264
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:26.373
or spiritual belief but there are levels of ordination

265
00:12:26.373 --> 00:12:30.658
that we attain as our consciousness begins to embrace

266
00:12:30.658 --> 00:12:32.972
greater and greater wisdom.

267
00:12:32.972 --> 00:12:36.885
And essential oil blends were all always used

268
00:12:36.885 --> 00:12:40.587
for the anointing of these moments of attainment.

269
00:12:40.587 --> 00:12:43.212
And I believe they were used to accelerate

270
00:12:43.212 --> 00:12:45.703
those moments of attainment.

271
00:12:45.703 --> 00:12:49.727
They were used for the consecration of priests, of kings.

272
00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:53.890
They were used for the consecration of a wedding.

273
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.852
They were used for the clearing of land.

274
00:12:57.852 --> 00:13:01.400
They were used for the consecration of a kingdom,

275
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.496
for when a tribe would move in to a particular area,

276
00:13:05.496 --> 00:13:07.205
of the tents,

277
00:13:07.205 --> 00:13:12.205
and the confines of the region would all be anointed.

278
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:18.447
To even bring the land into a consciousness blend

279
00:13:18.447 --> 00:13:20.931
with the inhabitance of it.

280
00:13:20.931 --> 00:13:22.577
<v Voiceover>It makes total sense.</v>

281
00:13:22.577 --> 00:13:24.529
And today, because today where ritual

282
00:13:24.529 --> 00:13:26.975
seems to be relatively empty.

283
00:13:26.975 --> 00:13:29.128
We think, oh, well, they've always done that.

284
00:13:29.128 --> 00:13:31.845
Not something to think that in each portion

285
00:13:31.845 --> 00:13:32.876
of a ritual,

286
00:13:32.876 --> 00:13:35.814
there has always been a solid base in the past

287
00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:38.250
and what would be called an esoteric science.

288
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.168
Now it's validated by the world of science.

289
00:13:41.168 --> 00:13:42.851
<v ->That's right.</v>

290
00:13:42.851 --> 00:13:45.755
<v Voiceover>So what would happen then,</v>

291
00:13:45.755 --> 00:13:49.449
let's go ahead and take it into the realm of healing,

292
00:13:49.449 --> 00:13:52.193
specifically into the real of healing the body.

293
00:13:52.193 --> 00:13:54.324
Can you talk about some of the oils,

294
00:13:54.324 --> 00:13:56.145
to be a little specific now,

295
00:13:56.145 --> 00:13:58.326
some of the oils and some of the healing effects

296
00:13:58.326 --> 00:14:00.124
that you have witnessed and also the oils

297
00:14:00.124 --> 00:14:02.851
accredited with historically.

298
00:14:02.851 --> 00:14:04.976
<v ->One of the most powerful,</v>

299
00:14:04.976 --> 00:14:07.162
well, first I should say that the oil blends

300
00:14:07.162 --> 00:14:11.296
that I've created have come through spiritual inspiration.

301
00:14:11.296 --> 00:14:15.837
And they are the result of an alchemical process.

302
00:14:15.837 --> 00:14:19.752
Now, this alchemical process seems to be recognized

303
00:14:19.752 --> 00:14:24.752
by the human consciousness and our bioenergetic fields

304
00:14:26.022 --> 00:14:30.711
as an imprinting of wholeness.

305
00:14:30.711 --> 00:14:34.351
We know that when we're whole, we're not ill.

306
00:14:34.351 --> 00:14:36.452
The recognition,

307
00:14:37.822 --> 00:14:42.287
perhaps I should say the harmonic response to wholeness

308
00:14:42.287 --> 00:14:46.791
creates more wholeness defenses in our self.

309
00:14:46.791 --> 00:14:50.166
In other words, our wholeness defenses become activated

310
00:14:50.166 --> 00:14:53.069
in the presence of something else that's recognized

311
00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:54.998
as being whole,

312
00:14:54.998 --> 00:14:57.521
as containing the energy of wholeness,

313
00:14:57.521 --> 00:14:59.484
the presence of wholeness.

314
00:14:59.484 --> 00:15:00.933
<v Voiceover>It goes into resonance with wholeness.</v>

315
00:15:00.933 --> 00:15:03.091
<v ->It goes into resonance with wholeness.</v>

316
00:15:03.091 --> 00:15:05.876
Also, as I mentioned just a moment before,

317
00:15:05.876 --> 00:15:10.876
our body has a megahertz frequency that

318
00:15:12.766 --> 00:15:17.575
resonates at a certain level when it's healthy.

319
00:15:17.575 --> 00:15:20.161
And it drops below that level.

320
00:15:20.161 --> 00:15:24.424
I believe the onset of cancer is about 52 megahertz.

321
00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:28.803
Different diseases have actually been measured in megahertz.

322
00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:31.799
I believe we move into the common cold

323
00:15:31.799 --> 00:15:33.086
somewhere in the,

324
00:15:34.414 --> 00:15:37.741
I think it's 58 megahertz.

325
00:15:39.931 --> 00:15:42.532
I have the information in this book that I've written,

326
00:15:42.532 --> 00:15:43.938
Anointed with Oil.

327
00:15:43.938 --> 00:15:48.938
But it's constantly being revised

328
00:15:49.013 --> 00:15:51.958
as there's more scientific understanding.

329
00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.342
<v Voiceover>Now this brings a question.</v>

330
00:15:53.342 --> 00:15:55.232
I'm going to inject it right here.

331
00:15:55.232 --> 00:15:57.945
How does one find out what their

332
00:15:57.945 --> 00:16:00.901
megahertz output is at a given time?

333
00:16:00.901 --> 00:16:03.571
What are some of the modalities where we can find out

334
00:16:03.571 --> 00:16:05.552
where we're resonating right now?

335
00:16:05.552 --> 00:16:10.552
<v ->This information is not readily available</v>

336
00:16:11.575 --> 00:16:13.111
to the average person.

337
00:16:13.111 --> 00:16:16.685
But there is a lot of research going into it right now.

338
00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:19.027
And I feel that within the next five years,

339
00:16:19.027 --> 00:16:21.555
instruments of this sort will be available.

340
00:16:21.555 --> 00:16:23.985
Perhaps you know of something I don't know of

341
00:16:23.985 --> 00:16:26.750
because if you're outreaching your connection with people.

342
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:30.352
I know that there is a lot of experimentation

343
00:16:30.352 --> 00:16:34.657
and some of it is more reliable than others,

344
00:16:34.657 --> 00:16:39.657
but its' been under very controlled situations.

345
00:16:40.132 --> 00:16:41.306
It has been determined.

346
00:16:41.306 --> 00:16:42.645
<v Voiceover>It's still fairly esoteric.</v>

347
00:16:42.645 --> 00:16:43.957
<v ->Yes, it is.</v>

348
00:16:43.957 --> 00:16:48.957
And it has been determined that it is a reliable factor

349
00:16:49.125 --> 00:16:53.287
provided we have reliable instrumentation to detect it.

350
00:16:53.287 --> 00:16:54.788
<v Voiceover>Exactly, I mean, we are walking</v>

351
00:16:54.788 --> 00:16:56.514
walking electromagnetic machine.

352
00:16:56.514 --> 00:16:57.735
<v ->Correct.</v>

353
00:16:57.735 --> 00:17:01.429
And so, the instrumentation that allows for this detection

354
00:17:01.429 --> 00:17:04.048
is now being developed.

355
00:17:04.048 --> 00:17:05.982
So this is cutting edge.

356
00:17:05.982 --> 00:17:08.038
<v Voiceover>Yes, so once we can actually see</v>

357
00:17:08.038 --> 00:17:11.270
at a frequency level, I mean, life technology

358
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.730
and these other older technologies that are now

359
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:16.374
being revived into newer versions,

360
00:17:16.374 --> 00:17:18.333
all are looking at frequencies.

361
00:17:18.333 --> 00:17:19.555
They're all electrical,

362
00:17:19.555 --> 00:17:23.280
it's such an essence electromagnetic medicine.

363
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.122
And certainly it would seem that essential oils

364
00:17:27.122 --> 00:17:31.055
are right at the top of the latter in terms of being

365
00:17:31.055 --> 00:17:32.548
able to affect that--

366
00:17:32.548 --> 00:17:33.655
<v ->They are.</v>

367
00:17:33.655 --> 00:17:36.570
They are and the alchemical blend

368
00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:41.570
accelerates that and allows the

369
00:17:41.962 --> 00:17:45.686
kind of essence to emerge which contains these

370
00:17:45.686 --> 00:17:47.549
higher frequencies of energy.

371
00:17:47.549 --> 00:17:49.181
<v Voiceover>Right, let me ask you this.</v>

372
00:17:49.181 --> 00:17:52.798
Some people that have essential oil

373
00:17:52.798 --> 00:17:56.213
either are experienced with it and write about it

374
00:17:56.213 --> 00:18:00.608
or even blend oils or create oils or sell oils say,

375
00:18:00.608 --> 00:18:02.813
"No, you can only have pure scents.

376
00:18:02.813 --> 00:18:07.535
"That's the only way to go, just single essences."

377
00:18:07.535 --> 00:18:11.138
And they really are dogmatic about the fact that

378
00:18:11.138 --> 00:18:12.590
you should never blend an oil.

379
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.211
It should always be just a single scent.

380
00:18:14.211 --> 00:18:16.101
What do you have to say to that?

381
00:18:16.101 --> 00:18:19.849
<v ->The tradition of aromatherapy holds it that way.</v>

382
00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:23.576
And actually, I think there is a lot of validity to it

383
00:18:23.576 --> 00:18:26.476
as long as we don't become zealous about it.

384
00:18:26.476 --> 00:18:30.406
Because when you are diagnosing a particular,

385
00:18:30.406 --> 00:18:35.232
you see, in the history of aromatherapy as medicine,

386
00:18:35.232 --> 00:18:38.943
there was a particular symptomatic diagnosis.

387
00:18:38.943 --> 00:18:42.479
And then a particular symptomatic treatment

388
00:18:42.479 --> 00:18:47.479
that we are learning that one of the

389
00:18:47.841 --> 00:18:50.903
weaknesses of allopathic medicine, although I do respect it

390
00:18:50.903 --> 00:18:53.246
as a science and its value to us,

391
00:18:53.246 --> 00:18:56.318
one of the weaknesses of it is that it addresses symptoms.

392
00:18:56.318 --> 00:18:57.339
<v Voiceover>Exactly, yeah.</v>

393
00:18:57.339 --> 00:19:01.667
<v ->And so we could fall into that same limitation</v>

394
00:19:01.667 --> 00:19:04.896
by being symptomatically limited

395
00:19:04.896 --> 00:19:06.586
in the use of essential oils.

396
00:19:06.586 --> 00:19:08.296
<v Voiceover>Versus holistic</v>

397
00:19:08.296 --> 00:19:11.503
and looking for the resonance of wholeness and balance.

398
00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.228
<v ->So there is great validity to it.</v>

399
00:19:15.228 --> 00:19:18.751
And I know that in certain healing situations,

400
00:19:18.751 --> 00:19:21.515
it gives the practitioner more control

401
00:19:21.515 --> 00:19:22.963
to have one essence,

402
00:19:22.963 --> 00:19:26.361
because a person can react to these.

403
00:19:26.361 --> 00:19:28.009
These are very powerful.

404
00:19:28.009 --> 00:19:31.762
And the use of them advises us to consider

405
00:19:31.762 --> 00:19:34.452
the principal essence more.

406
00:19:34.452 --> 00:19:39.056
As I said, one drop can cover every cell in your body

407
00:19:39.056 --> 00:19:40.366
within minutes.

408
00:19:41.332 --> 00:19:42.316
<v Voiceover>Very powerful.</v>

409
00:19:42.316 --> 00:19:44.283
<v ->They are very very powerful.</v>

410
00:19:44.283 --> 00:19:48.493
And if a person does have a reaction to essential oils,

411
00:19:48.493 --> 00:19:50.656
that reaction may be

412
00:19:52.745 --> 00:19:56.070
a diagnostic tool, a valuable diagnostic tool

413
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.848
for the aromatherapist then to say,

414
00:19:57.848 --> 00:20:02.009
ah, that tells me X, W, and Z.

415
00:20:02.009 --> 00:20:06.567
And then the aroma is changed

416
00:20:06.567 --> 00:20:09.985
or it's modified in some way.

417
00:20:09.985 --> 00:20:14.072
And so by using a particular essence,

418
00:20:14.072 --> 00:20:19.072
the practitioner has more shall we say intellectual control

419
00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.948
over the process and can target and direct

420
00:20:22.948 --> 00:20:25.218
the therapeutic applications.

421
00:20:25.218 --> 00:20:28.281
So I think there is a certain validity for that approach

422
00:20:28.281 --> 00:20:32.749
as long as it doesn't become zealously dogmatic.

423
00:20:32.749 --> 00:20:34.547
As we're learning, the pit fall of anything

424
00:20:34.547 --> 00:20:36.762
we become zealously dogmatic about.

425
00:20:36.762 --> 00:20:40.869
And there is a place for anointing

426
00:20:40.869 --> 00:20:44.630
with oils that can trigger our wholeness.

427
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.013
<v Voiceover>And now that's where you come in.</v>

428
00:20:46.013 --> 00:20:49.336
And that's really where your love of oils has taken you

429
00:20:49.336 --> 00:20:53.192
is to focus very strongly on this area of anointing.

430
00:20:53.192 --> 00:20:57.571
So tell us how, you have some just beautiful scents here

431
00:20:57.571 --> 00:20:59.543
and they have names that are very direct like

432
00:20:59.543 --> 00:21:04.543
love and abundance and aliveness and holy ground.

433
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:07.890
Tell us how you would, as a consumer,

434
00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.788
utilize these both in terms of the way

435
00:21:10.788 --> 00:21:12.404
you would do it, the ritual itself

436
00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:15.213
but also how you would find yourself

437
00:21:15.213 --> 00:21:17.158
attracted to a certain one for example.

438
00:21:17.158 --> 00:21:21.623
<v ->I'm glad you asked that last part of it because</v>

439
00:21:21.623 --> 00:21:24.900
intuition plays an enormous role

440
00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.986
in the way we use sacred oils.

441
00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:32.701
And let's just say that you are at a store that has these.

442
00:21:33.703 --> 00:21:36.116
And we are expanding at the this moment

443
00:21:36.116 --> 00:21:38.786
so we're commonly available

444
00:21:38.786 --> 00:21:41.905
although for the most part they're only available

445
00:21:41.905 --> 00:21:42.987
through our store right now.

446
00:21:42.987 --> 00:21:44.126
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

447
00:21:45.321 --> 00:21:47.160
<v ->But let's say you have a set,</v>

448
00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.789
you would go to them in the morning

449
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:51.576
and you will just allow your hand to be directed.

450
00:21:51.576 --> 00:21:54.678
Remember, your hand is an electromagnetic instrument.

451
00:21:54.678 --> 00:21:59.678
And it will travel like a Geiger counter to what it needs

452
00:21:59.806 --> 00:22:02.993
then you can confirm it with your sense of smell.

453
00:22:02.993 --> 00:22:07.414
If you're very very sensitive to aroma,

454
00:22:07.414 --> 00:22:09.734
I would suggest that you use them primarily

455
00:22:09.734 --> 00:22:12.450
with a room deffuser.

456
00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:16.652
That could be anything from a piece of cloth that you put

457
00:22:16.652 --> 00:22:20.492
the oil on and you just allow to sit by a fan

458
00:22:20.492 --> 00:22:25.133
to perhaps an actual--

459
00:22:25.133 --> 00:22:27.122
<v Voiceover>What about the heated deffuser bowls?</v>

460
00:22:27.122 --> 00:22:31.192
<v ->I, for pure essential oils,</v>

461
00:22:31.192 --> 00:22:33.390
that is the varietals,

462
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:38.390
the individual oils such as lavender or sandalwoods.

463
00:22:38.869 --> 00:22:41.076
The heater deffusers are fine.

464
00:22:41.076 --> 00:22:43.279
For the blends I would not recommend them

465
00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:46.194
because it breaks down the alchemical blend.

466
00:22:46.194 --> 00:22:51.194
So I would not apply heat to a sacred oil blend.

467
00:22:51.293 --> 00:22:53.431
I would use a cold deffuser,

468
00:22:53.431 --> 00:22:56.766
something that a lot of people enjoy

469
00:22:56.766 --> 00:23:01.013
is a little necklace with a clay disk at the end of it

470
00:23:01.013 --> 00:23:03.699
and the clay is absorbent.

471
00:23:03.699 --> 00:23:06.316
You can find these in a lot of stores now.

472
00:23:06.316 --> 00:23:08.893
And that makes a wonderful diffuser.

473
00:23:08.893 --> 00:23:11.368
After you've experimented with the fragrances

474
00:23:11.368 --> 00:23:15.955
and you know what they do for you

475
00:23:15.955 --> 00:23:18.676
and how you relate to them

476
00:23:18.676 --> 00:23:20.811
and or possibly react to them,

477
00:23:20.811 --> 00:23:23.523
then you can begin by introducing a small amount

478
00:23:23.523 --> 00:23:26.822
on your body and I would suggest that the pulse points

479
00:23:26.822 --> 00:23:29.204
such as the wrist or the neck,

480
00:23:29.204 --> 00:23:34.204
because our pulse points help to create more radiance

481
00:23:35.952 --> 00:23:38.851
for the oils into our environment.

482
00:23:38.851 --> 00:23:41.982
And one of the things you don't have to worry about

483
00:23:41.982 --> 00:23:45.357
that you do with perfumes is that these will not

484
00:23:45.357 --> 00:23:48.820
offend other people because they only radiate

485
00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.042
into our zone of intimacy.

486
00:23:51.042 --> 00:23:54.113
These are not like commercial perfumes

487
00:23:54.113 --> 00:23:58.260
that were literally created to intoxicate a room.

488
00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.379
<v Voiceover>Oh, with exotic cat urine</v>

489
00:24:00.379 --> 00:24:02.302
at the base and so forth.

490
00:24:02.302 --> 00:24:03.787
<v ->Yes.</v>

491
00:24:03.787 --> 00:24:05.031
<v Voiceover>Yeah, they radiate.</v>

492
00:24:05.031 --> 00:24:05.921
<v ->Yes, they do.</v>

493
00:24:05.921 --> 00:24:06.971
<v Voiceover>Anyone knows if their cat</v>

494
00:24:06.971 --> 00:24:09.707
has made their territory how they can radiate.

495
00:24:09.707 --> 00:24:10.838
<v ->Oh, yes.</v>

496
00:24:10.838 --> 00:24:13.293
(laughter)

497
00:24:13.293 --> 00:24:17.263
And sometimes they can feel the room just obnoxiously.

498
00:24:17.263 --> 00:24:20.501
These only exist in your zone of intimacy.

499
00:24:20.501 --> 00:24:23.637
And they will conform to your body chemistry

500
00:24:23.637 --> 00:24:26.260
so that you are radiating something

501
00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:30.368
that is unique and special about you.

502
00:24:32.057 --> 00:24:34.544
<v Voiceover>Yes, I see this because</v>

503
00:24:34.544 --> 00:24:36.779
I live in the little town as we both do

504
00:24:39.189 --> 00:24:40.623
where you really don't smell much perfume in this town

505
00:24:40.623 --> 00:24:43.362
and you smell a lot of essential oils here and there.

506
00:24:43.362 --> 00:24:46.662
But, again, there is never this offensive type of

507
00:24:46.662 --> 00:24:50.079
quality to it even if it's an oil that may not be

508
00:24:50.079 --> 00:24:51.852
your perfect resonance that day,

509
00:24:51.852 --> 00:24:55.958
it's as though you're smelling an apple versus an orange.

510
00:24:55.958 --> 00:24:58.407
It's still holistic and recognized by the body

511
00:24:58.407 --> 00:25:01.919
as something safe and healing and non-toxic.

512
00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:03.085
<v ->And it is.</v>

513
00:25:03.085 --> 00:25:04.851
Oh, and while we are on fragrance,

514
00:25:04.851 --> 00:25:08.638
I would like to indicate that the tradition

515
00:25:08.638 --> 00:25:13.638
of aromatherapy as a symptomatic medicinal treatment

516
00:25:13.706 --> 00:25:15.675
has its own lineage.

517
00:25:15.675 --> 00:25:17.965
And the history of anointing oils

518
00:25:17.965 --> 00:25:19.605
has its own sacred lineage.

519
00:25:19.605 --> 00:25:20.637
<v Voiceover>Can you tell us the difference</v>

520
00:25:20.637 --> 00:25:21.569
between the two?

521
00:25:21.569 --> 00:25:22.510
<v ->Yes.</v>

522
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:26.417
Well, a sacred oil blends used for anointing,

523
00:25:28.237 --> 00:25:30.609
as we talked about just a few minutes ago,

524
00:25:32.276 --> 00:25:37.228
they are the result of an alchemical blending process.

525
00:25:37.228 --> 00:25:42.228
The tradition of healing is not as ancient.

526
00:25:42.367 --> 00:25:45.056
Well, it probably is but in recorded records

527
00:25:45.056 --> 00:25:46.488
it's not as ancient.

528
00:25:46.488 --> 00:25:50.659
We find it appearing with writings of Hypocrites

529
00:25:50.659 --> 00:25:51.876
and we find it in the Greeks,

530
00:25:51.876 --> 00:25:53.907
we find some of it in the Egyptians.

531
00:25:53.907 --> 00:25:57.511
But for the most part, the most ancient traditions

532
00:25:57.511 --> 00:26:00.313
were the anointing traditions.

533
00:26:00.313 --> 00:26:03.261
And in relation to fragrance,

534
00:26:03.261 --> 00:26:05.511
there's something very important to say about that

535
00:26:05.511 --> 00:26:09.392
is that the anointing oils usually are beautiful.

536
00:26:09.392 --> 00:26:11.826
There's a prettiness about them.

537
00:26:11.826 --> 00:26:14.052
There's something that we have a profound

538
00:26:14.052 --> 00:26:16.568
aesthetic response to.

539
00:26:16.568 --> 00:26:20.362
And I believe that's because we recognize its wholeness.

540
00:26:20.362 --> 00:26:21.747
<v Voiceover>I think you're right on that.</v>

541
00:26:21.747 --> 00:26:24.012
I mean, personally, that's how I recognize it.

542
00:26:24.012 --> 00:26:29.012
If I smell any of these individual oils,

543
00:26:29.146 --> 00:26:31.940
there may be a range of about 15 or 20%

544
00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.258
that I really enjoy and resonate with and the rest are

545
00:26:34.258 --> 00:26:37.737
a little too strong for me versus the blended oils,

546
00:26:37.737 --> 00:26:40.593
your blended oils in particular,

547
00:26:40.593 --> 00:26:42.685
I can resonate with each one of them.

548
00:26:42.685 --> 00:26:44.838
It might be I'll resonate more of one on one day

549
00:26:44.838 --> 00:26:47.452
or one on another but none of them have

550
00:26:47.452 --> 00:26:52.452
an overly, what is the word I'm looking for,

551
00:26:52.531 --> 00:26:54.870
none of them are too strong and in of themselves for me

552
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.536
to be able to handle personally.

553
00:26:57.536 --> 00:26:58.515
Yeah.
<v ->Right.</v>

554
00:26:58.515 --> 00:27:01.329
And some of the varietals can be very pungent.

555
00:27:01.329 --> 00:27:02.776
They can actually be offensive.

556
00:27:02.776 --> 00:27:04.636
<v Voiceover>Yes, I didn't wanna say the word offensive</v>

557
00:27:04.636 --> 00:27:05.538
but they can be.

558
00:27:05.538 --> 00:27:06.296
<v ->They can be.</v>

559
00:27:06.296 --> 00:27:06.992
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

560
00:27:06.992 --> 00:27:09.273
<v ->And so if someone's had the experience</v>

561
00:27:09.273 --> 00:27:13.874
of just going into a store and pulling up the vials up

562
00:27:13.874 --> 00:27:17.013
and testing them and says, oh, oh my,

563
00:27:17.013 --> 00:27:19.428
no way am I going to put that on my body.

564
00:27:20.418 --> 00:27:23.425
The sacred oil blends have a different tradition.

565
00:27:23.425 --> 00:27:28.425
Even now, well, to give you a little background.

566
00:27:28.982 --> 00:27:31.668
One of the things that fitted me for being able to become

567
00:27:31.668 --> 00:27:35.206
an alchemist is that I used to own a vineyard.

568
00:27:35.206 --> 00:27:38.673
And I was very involved in the world of wine

569
00:27:38.673 --> 00:27:40.779
and the world of grapes,

570
00:27:40.779 --> 00:27:45.174
and very aware of the microclimates and microcultures

571
00:27:45.174 --> 00:27:47.000
that grapes were grown in

572
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.171
down to the years, down to the way

573
00:27:50.171 --> 00:27:55.171
they were harvested and blended.

574
00:27:56.485 --> 00:27:58.523
It's the same with essential oils.

575
00:27:58.523 --> 00:28:02.986
And so when I interview suppliers

576
00:28:02.986 --> 00:28:06.357
and I look at supplies from all over the world,

577
00:28:06.357 --> 00:28:10.381
one of the things that is amazing is how different

578
00:28:10.381 --> 00:28:14.308
frankincense, just frankincense or myrrh

579
00:28:14.308 --> 00:28:18.460
or sandalwood can be from microclimate to microclimate,

580
00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:22.318
from distillation process to distillation process,

581
00:28:22.318 --> 00:28:26.611
from degrees of purity, density, heaviness,

582
00:28:26.611 --> 00:28:30.588
is it first draft, second draft, third draft and so forth.

583
00:28:30.588 --> 00:28:34.183
When I'm looking for ingredients for the essential oils,

584
00:28:34.183 --> 00:28:37.191
it's very interesting that the cultures

585
00:28:37.191 --> 00:28:40.747
that it had a strong tradition on sacred oils

586
00:28:40.747 --> 00:28:44.193
such as Egypt will produce varietals

587
00:28:44.193 --> 00:28:46.646
that are more beautiful.

588
00:28:46.646 --> 00:28:47.567
<v Voiceover>True.</v>

589
00:28:47.567 --> 00:28:49.823
A really different scent to the Egyptian oils.

590
00:28:49.823 --> 00:28:53.705
<v ->They have a different orientation toward</v>

591
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:58.088
what they grow, how they distill it,

592
00:28:58.088 --> 00:28:59.771
how they refine it.

593
00:28:59.771 --> 00:29:03.614
And their orientation is towards something more beautiful.

594
00:29:03.614 --> 00:29:05.370
<v Voiceover>It also seems like it's a lot thicker</v>

595
00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:08.538
and darker than a lot of the other oils that I've seen.

596
00:29:08.538 --> 00:29:09.766
<v ->Not necessarily.</v>

597
00:29:09.766 --> 00:29:11.357
<v Voiceover>That might be just that one</v>

598
00:29:11.357 --> 00:29:13.138
particular processor.

599
00:29:13.138 --> 00:29:13.886
Okay.

600
00:29:13.886 --> 00:29:14.466
<v ->Right.</v>

601
00:29:14.466 --> 00:29:16.974
<v Voiceover>Yeah, so the Egyptians understand it</v>

602
00:29:16.974 --> 00:29:19.219
to a depth that they're creating more beauty

603
00:29:19.219 --> 00:29:21.090
in terms of the scents that they produce.

604
00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:22.235
Okay.
<v ->Yes.</v>

605
00:29:22.235 --> 00:29:22.979
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

606
00:29:22.979 --> 00:29:25.226
<v ->And actually, that's the origin of perfume as we know it.</v>

607
00:29:25.226 --> 00:29:26.584
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

608
00:29:26.584 --> 00:29:27.541
Yes.

609
00:29:29.963 --> 00:29:32.018
Can we talk about the processes?

610
00:29:32.018 --> 00:29:35.247
When you're getting into the production of essential oils

611
00:29:35.247 --> 00:29:36.825
as you say you have the first, second,

612
00:29:36.825 --> 00:29:37.994
third draft, so forth,

613
00:29:37.994 --> 00:29:40.195
there are the hydrosols that are starting to appear

614
00:29:40.195 --> 00:29:41.504
on the market now.

615
00:29:41.504 --> 00:29:44.188
Can you explain what a hydrosol is?

616
00:29:44.188 --> 00:29:48.187
<v ->That's a plant essence that's water distilled.</v>

617
00:29:48.187 --> 00:29:51.026
And actually that's the most ancient

618
00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:56.166
essence that was ever distilled

619
00:29:56.166 --> 00:29:59.008
because we had water distillation processes

620
00:29:59.008 --> 00:30:01.972
long before we had oil distillation processes.

621
00:30:01.972 --> 00:30:06.368
At least in terms of what we can know about modern,

622
00:30:06.368 --> 00:30:08.040
modern recorded history.

623
00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.456
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

624
00:30:09.456 --> 00:30:14.093
<v ->The first oil distillation process really didn't occur</v>

625
00:30:14.093 --> 00:30:17.370
standardly and effectively until the 14th century.

626
00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:19.382
But there were water distillation processes

627
00:30:19.382 --> 00:30:21.467
long before that.

628
00:30:23.907 --> 00:30:27.900
It still brings the sacred plant essence to us

629
00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.475
not in a lipid form.

630
00:30:30.475 --> 00:30:33.549
The lipid form is essential to cross

631
00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:35.610
the blood brain barrier.

632
00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:37.135
<v Voiceover>Good point, yes.</v>

633
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:43.192
<v ->When many of the ancient sacred text</v>

634
00:30:43.192 --> 00:30:46.062
refer to oils, one of the things they're referring to

635
00:30:46.062 --> 00:30:49.739
is actually not our modern distilled essential oils.

636
00:30:49.739 --> 00:30:51.664
They're referring to infusions.

637
00:30:51.664 --> 00:30:55.430
And the way the ancients had of gaining

638
00:30:58.536 --> 00:31:01.448
alchemical access to the essential oils

639
00:31:01.448 --> 00:31:05.567
contained in plants was to put,

640
00:31:05.567 --> 00:31:08.909
for example, rosemary, in olive oil.

641
00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:11.224
And it would sit for a long time.

642
00:31:11.224 --> 00:31:14.964
And the olive oil would extract the essential oil.

643
00:31:14.964 --> 00:31:17.726
So what they would have would be a blend

644
00:31:17.726 --> 00:31:20.906
of olive oil and rosemary essential oil.

645
00:31:20.906 --> 00:31:23.012
<v Voiceover>Right, an infused oil just like we used</v>

646
00:31:23.012 --> 00:31:24.214
for cooking today.

647
00:31:24.214 --> 00:31:25.676
<v ->Correct.</v>

648
00:31:26.524 --> 00:31:27.570
Yeah.

649
00:31:28.528 --> 00:31:31.699
<v Voiceover>So the hydrosols would be more viewed</v>

650
00:31:34.079 --> 00:31:37.794
just as a way of perfuming the air around you

651
00:31:37.794 --> 00:31:40.870
but not necessarily having the same depth of healing

652
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:42.924
effect, of course, as an essential oil.

653
00:31:42.924 --> 00:31:45.422
<v ->Not necessarily.</v>

654
00:31:47.262 --> 00:31:49.362
You're, of course, familiar with homeopathy.

655
00:31:49.362 --> 00:31:53.343
And there's a homeopathic quality

656
00:31:53.343 --> 00:31:58.334
that when we are in the plant essence in any form,

657
00:31:58.334 --> 00:32:03.334
it can trigger an alchemical response in us

658
00:32:03.405 --> 00:32:07.430
or a biochemical response more accurately said.

659
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:12.430
And so we can respond to it as a stimulus form.

660
00:32:13.472 --> 00:32:16.134
And so the hydrosols give us a very powerful,

661
00:32:16.134 --> 00:32:21.134
very pure trigger that stimulates processes we need

662
00:32:21.491 --> 00:32:23.339
to undergo for our healing.

663
00:32:23.339 --> 00:32:25.354
So they can affect our healing.

664
00:32:25.354 --> 00:32:27.819
They're not just for beauty.

665
00:32:27.819 --> 00:32:30.640
It's just that they offer,

666
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.466
they offer a subtlety--

667
00:32:32.466 --> 00:32:33.948
<v Voiceover>Yes, they're very subtle.</v>

668
00:32:33.948 --> 00:32:38.505
<v ->They offer a subtlety that sometimes can be overwhelmed</v>

669
00:32:38.505 --> 00:32:41.549
by the strength in essential oils.

670
00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:46.549
And so many healers who prefer a more subtle approach

671
00:32:47.115 --> 00:32:49.642
would use the hydrosols.

672
00:32:49.642 --> 00:32:51.075
<v Voiceover>Are there any hydrosol blends?</v>

673
00:32:51.075 --> 00:32:55.028
I've only seen pure strain hydrosols.

674
00:32:55.028 --> 00:32:56.053
<v ->No, there are blends.</v>

675
00:32:56.053 --> 00:32:56.850
<v Voiceover>Are there blends?</v>

676
00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:57.408
I just--

677
00:32:57.408 --> 00:33:01.340
<v ->I'm not well informed enough to make a recommendation</v>

678
00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.643
but yes, there are.

679
00:33:02.643 --> 00:33:03.962
<v Voiceover>Oh, okay, all right.</v>

680
00:33:03.962 --> 00:33:06.569
So a hydrosol has its place at working on the

681
00:33:06.569 --> 00:33:09.001
more subtle realm and it's working through

682
00:33:09.001 --> 00:33:10.309
the olfactory sense.

683
00:33:10.309 --> 00:33:15.309
And as you say then that stimulates the amygdala.

684
00:33:15.353 --> 00:33:17.818
<v ->And the amygdala stimulates the cells</v>

685
00:33:17.818 --> 00:33:20.155
and our whole body system

686
00:33:20.155 --> 00:33:22.819
at a level below our consciousness.

687
00:33:22.819 --> 00:33:24.925
Now, there's something I like to talk about,

688
00:33:24.925 --> 00:33:26.849
sometimes in my extended lectures,

689
00:33:26.849 --> 00:33:30.651
is that through essential oils we can instigate

690
00:33:30.651 --> 00:33:32.339
a conspiracy of enlightenment.

691
00:33:33.639 --> 00:33:35.817
<v Voiceover>Very good way to put it.</v>

692
00:33:35.817 --> 00:33:38.410
<v ->And the reason I call it a conspiracy is because</v>

693
00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:41.267
we're bypassing all of the conscious filters

694
00:33:41.267 --> 00:33:44.204
that we've created to say, no, this can't be possible,

695
00:33:44.204 --> 00:33:45.808
no, this can't happen,

696
00:33:47.068 --> 00:33:49.313
all the things that we have,

697
00:33:49.313 --> 00:33:52.353
the conscious filters we've limited our life with.

698
00:33:52.353 --> 00:33:55.973
We can circumvent these limiting filters

699
00:33:55.973 --> 00:33:58.923
with a substance that can trigger our highest

700
00:33:58.923 --> 00:34:03.151
spiritual response and also our direct

701
00:34:03.151 --> 00:34:07.878
unfiltered, unconscious biochemical response.

702
00:34:07.878 --> 00:34:09.685
In other words, through the amygdala

703
00:34:09.685 --> 00:34:12.367
it goes to the limbic autonomic nervous system

704
00:34:12.367 --> 00:34:15.463
to trigger a whole body response

705
00:34:15.463 --> 00:34:19.814
from the cellular level that then combines

706
00:34:19.814 --> 00:34:23.369
like a hand and a glove with our spiritual

707
00:34:23.369 --> 00:34:27.437
faculties that know no limitation.

708
00:34:27.437 --> 00:34:29.904
And we can literally circumvent

709
00:34:29.904 --> 00:34:32.497
our conscious limited

710
00:34:34.447 --> 00:34:39.447
formulas in the box ideas about how life should be.

711
00:34:40.237 --> 00:34:44.315
And I think this is what the ancient alchemist knew.

712
00:34:45.546 --> 00:34:47.763
<v Voiceover>Okay, let's say we're going to get on that.</v>

713
00:34:47.763 --> 00:34:50.524
Let's say we're gonna do this within our families

714
00:34:50.524 --> 00:34:53.891
and within our work environments.

715
00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:56.835
Give us some of the ideas of the qualities

716
00:34:56.835 --> 00:34:59.139
of some of these oils we have in front of us right now

717
00:34:59.139 --> 00:35:01.715
and how they might best be utilized.

718
00:35:01.715 --> 00:35:02.659
<v ->Okay.</v>

719
00:35:02.659 --> 00:35:04.297
<v Voiceover>We have to work on a subtle level.</v>

720
00:35:04.297 --> 00:35:06.947
<v ->Right, well, we touched on this a few minutes ago</v>

721
00:35:06.947 --> 00:35:08.692
with the room diffuser.

722
00:35:08.692 --> 00:35:10.269
<v Voiceover>I mean not the way when which</v>

723
00:35:10.269 --> 00:35:12.251
you distribute it but the actual oils you would use

724
00:35:12.251 --> 00:35:16.698
for certain types of effects, certain types of upliftment.

725
00:35:16.698 --> 00:35:19.884
<v ->One of our oils is called joy.</v>

726
00:35:19.884 --> 00:35:22.410
And it's a great way to start the day.

727
00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:23.400
<v Voiceover>I love that one.</v>

728
00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.736
I hope I'm not using too much

729
00:35:24.736 --> 00:35:26.652
'cause I usually use about five drops,

730
00:35:26.652 --> 00:35:28.450
I can't get enough of it.

731
00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:30.496
<v ->It's just delicious.</v>

732
00:35:30.496 --> 00:35:34.113
It's like the most beautiful day in May.

733
00:35:34.113 --> 00:35:36.631
<v Voiceover>It is, it is absolutely lovely.</v>

734
00:35:36.631 --> 00:35:39.261
It's my favorite scent right now.

735
00:35:39.261 --> 00:35:41.738
<v ->And for example, if I were in an office</v>

736
00:35:41.738 --> 00:35:44.602
and there was a little bit of grumpiness going on around,

737
00:35:44.602 --> 00:35:47.452
I would put some drops of oil on my diffuser.

738
00:35:47.452 --> 00:35:50.015
I would have a little diffuser beside mu computer

739
00:35:50.015 --> 00:35:53.068
on my desk, and I would put a few drops of joy

740
00:35:53.068 --> 00:35:56.018
and I just go to this place of joy.

741
00:35:56.018 --> 00:35:58.263
My body goes to the place of joy,

742
00:35:58.263 --> 00:36:00.445
spiritually I go to the place of joy.

743
00:36:00.445 --> 00:36:03.502
And then I only engage with these conscious faculties

744
00:36:03.502 --> 00:36:07.798
that might have to deal with some grumpiness in the room.

745
00:36:07.798 --> 00:36:10.615
Only if a situation required it.

746
00:36:10.615 --> 00:36:12.533
Otherwise I would be in my place of joy

747
00:36:12.533 --> 00:36:14.878
just doing my work,

748
00:36:14.878 --> 00:36:17.825
getting through my day at a much higher level.

749
00:36:17.825 --> 00:36:19.635
There's fragrance called abundance.

750
00:36:20.652 --> 00:36:22.394
<v Voiceover>Big one.</v>
<v ->Big one.</v>

751
00:36:22.394 --> 00:36:25.858
If I ever began feeling a sense of scarcity in life

752
00:36:25.858 --> 00:36:29.198
such as there's not enough of whatever,

753
00:36:29.198 --> 00:36:32.052
and that's not limited to money.

754
00:36:32.052 --> 00:36:36.267
That, also, is directed toward opportunities, ideas,

755
00:36:36.267 --> 00:36:40.708
people who support us, inspiration, places to go,

756
00:36:40.708 --> 00:36:43.922
things to do, abundance.

757
00:36:43.922 --> 00:36:47.633
I anoint myself with abundance.

758
00:36:47.633 --> 00:36:51.312
And it is just miraculous,

759
00:36:51.312 --> 00:36:55.589
the way it tells my body that there is no limitation

760
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:58.075
and then it triggers me spiritually

761
00:36:58.075 --> 00:37:00.782
to embrace all the abundance of the universe.

762
00:37:00.782 --> 00:37:04.782
So that whatever conscious facility might be telling me,

763
00:37:04.782 --> 00:37:07.632
there are more bills than money in the bank,

764
00:37:07.632 --> 00:37:09.304
I just don't go there.

765
00:37:09.304 --> 00:37:12.358
That's what I mean by conspiracy of enlightenment.

766
00:37:12.358 --> 00:37:16.875
But because I don't focus upon these limited

767
00:37:18.028 --> 00:37:22.666
ideas, these limited concepts that we can

768
00:37:22.666 --> 00:37:25.575
literally put on light close

769
00:37:25.575 --> 00:37:28.468
and unfortunately wear them to wear in red tags

770
00:37:28.468 --> 00:37:29.872
that don't work for us.

771
00:37:29.872 --> 00:37:31.289
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

772
00:37:31.289 --> 00:37:32.450
So we've grown out of them,

773
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:34.833
the sleeves are too short, they're frayed.

774
00:37:34.833 --> 00:37:35.758
<v ->Exactly.</v>

775
00:37:35.758 --> 00:37:36.798
<v Voiceover>And they're uncomfortable.</v>

776
00:37:36.798 --> 00:37:38.016
<v ->We just don't go there.</v>

777
00:37:38.016 --> 00:37:38.953
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

778
00:37:38.953 --> 00:37:40.074
<v ->We just don't go there.</v>

779
00:37:40.074 --> 00:37:43.192
And before we can worry about the fact that

780
00:37:43.192 --> 00:37:46.161
we didn't go there between,

781
00:37:46.161 --> 00:37:50.492
like I said, our body can hold more information

782
00:37:50.492 --> 00:37:53.078
than all the computers in the world.

783
00:37:54.232 --> 00:37:56.946
Now, just imagine how much information we are

784
00:37:56.946 --> 00:38:01.800
symbiotically accumulating through intuition

785
00:38:02.825 --> 00:38:06.013
just unconsciously being in the environment

786
00:38:06.013 --> 00:38:09.599
of other people or other possibilities.

787
00:38:09.599 --> 00:38:13.131
Think about our spirit that knows no boundaries whatsoever.

788
00:38:14.003 --> 00:38:16.528
Now, get the idea that between

789
00:38:16.528 --> 00:38:18.360
what the spirit can accumulate

790
00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.703
and what the body can retain.

791
00:38:22.204 --> 00:38:25.896
And put those two together as a formula for living

792
00:38:25.896 --> 00:38:29.875
how we can outdistance any limited faculty

793
00:38:29.875 --> 00:38:33.104
that our consciousness could be embedded in.

794
00:38:33.104 --> 00:38:35.996
And pretty soon, the abundance of connections,

795
00:38:35.996 --> 00:38:38.537
the abundance of opportunities, inspiration,

796
00:38:38.537 --> 00:38:42.426
and yes, even money, is right there on the table.

797
00:38:43.742 --> 00:38:46.056
<v Voiceover>And can you give us some anecdotes</v>

798
00:38:46.056 --> 00:38:48.109
about people who have utilized this oil

799
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:49.613
and some of the comments you've had.

800
00:38:49.613 --> 00:38:52.398
Let's say with the abundance oil.

801
00:38:54.208 --> 00:38:55.734
<v ->There have been people who</v>

802
00:38:55.734 --> 00:38:58.868
were virtually out of their homes.

803
00:38:58.868 --> 00:39:02.391
They were virtually ready to just go live with the relatives

804
00:39:02.391 --> 00:39:05.615
which is a proposition I can't even,

805
00:39:05.615 --> 00:39:06.791
I can't even imagine.

806
00:39:06.791 --> 00:39:10.319
But they were ready to just go live with their in-laws.

807
00:39:10.319 --> 00:39:11.400
<v Voiceover>Back to mom and dad.</v>

808
00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.633
<v ->Oh, my gosh.</v>

809
00:39:12.633 --> 00:39:14.900
You know, it's a terrible feeling,

810
00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:17.584
to feel that you've gone up to the

811
00:39:17.584 --> 00:39:21.450
wide ocean of the world and you didn't make it.

812
00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:26.122
And they've just had one experience with this

813
00:39:26.968 --> 00:39:31.179
and abandoned the idea of limitation

814
00:39:31.179 --> 00:39:33.504
within minutes or hours.

815
00:39:33.504 --> 00:39:36.045
Someone would call them

816
00:39:36.045 --> 00:39:38.748
out of the blue miraculously

817
00:39:38.748 --> 00:39:40.477
and it would be with a new job.

818
00:39:42.089 --> 00:39:45.671
It would be with a new idea, a new offer.

819
00:39:45.671 --> 00:39:47.446
They would go to the mailbox and there would be money

820
00:39:47.446 --> 00:39:48.383
in the mail.

821
00:39:48.383 --> 00:39:52.202
Or they would be guided intuitively to call someone

822
00:39:52.202 --> 00:39:54.174
they haven't called in years.

823
00:39:54.174 --> 00:39:56.809
And that person would have the answer.

824
00:39:56.809 --> 00:39:59.841
You see, our bodies know how to tell us intuitively

825
00:39:59.841 --> 00:40:00.742
what to do.

826
00:40:00.742 --> 00:40:02.798
They have all of this information.

827
00:40:02.798 --> 00:40:05.597
And then spiritually we don't have any boundaries.

828
00:40:05.597 --> 00:40:08.488
We create our sense of scarcity

829
00:40:08.488 --> 00:40:11.467
through our limited conscious faculties.

830
00:40:12.434 --> 00:40:15.239
<v Voiceover>So this beautiful essence</v>

831
00:40:15.239 --> 00:40:18.422
from the planet that sustains our lives then

832
00:40:18.422 --> 00:40:22.733
is infusing us with all of the boundless intelligence

833
00:40:22.733 --> 00:40:25.508
and information encoded within if to work then

834
00:40:25.508 --> 00:40:29.101
with our spiritual consciousness as well as our body

835
00:40:29.101 --> 00:40:31.680
memory consciousness and essence

836
00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:35.498
together the oils, the spirit, and the body's memory

837
00:40:35.498 --> 00:40:39.478
and consciousness lift us into boundless realities.

838
00:40:39.478 --> 00:40:40.739
<v ->That's correct.</v>

839
00:40:40.739 --> 00:40:42.827
And as we refer to as wholeness.

840
00:40:42.827 --> 00:40:45.069
That's body, mind, and spirit.

841
00:40:45.069 --> 00:40:47.876
And when we can engage all three

842
00:40:47.876 --> 00:40:50.130
at the same frequency level,

843
00:40:51.205 --> 00:40:53.782
we've got a powerful outreach.

844
00:40:55.132 --> 00:40:56.859
<v Voiceover>Do you mind telling me a couple</v>

845
00:40:56.859 --> 00:40:58.712
of more stories about a couple of more of these.

846
00:40:58.712 --> 00:40:59.465
I love stories.

847
00:40:59.465 --> 00:41:00.644
I love success stories.

848
00:41:00.644 --> 00:41:01.486
<v ->Sure.</v>

849
00:41:01.486 --> 00:41:04.060
<v Voiceover>A couple of more oils that come to mind.</v>

850
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:05.004
<v ->Okay.</v>

851
00:41:05.924 --> 00:41:07.006
<v Voiceover>If you hear a little tinkling</v>

852
00:41:07.006 --> 00:41:08.994
in the background as you're listening to this

853
00:41:08.994 --> 00:41:12.415
is 'cause we're rattling these little bottles of oil down.

854
00:41:12.415 --> 00:41:15.552
<v ->One of the most powerful of the oils is forgiveness.</v>

855
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:21.020
And it was created to cleanse

856
00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.489
the negative memories we've hung on to.

857
00:41:24.564 --> 00:41:29.338
And in particular, I recommend that forgiveness be used

858
00:41:29.338 --> 00:41:34.338
in any area where a person has symptomatic issues.

859
00:41:36.689 --> 00:41:40.336
Because it will release the memories that are holding

860
00:41:40.336 --> 00:41:41.966
those symptoms in place.

861
00:41:43.944 --> 00:41:47.253
There was a story that happened at a

862
00:41:47.253 --> 00:41:49.369
local shop.

863
00:41:49.369 --> 00:41:51.072
It was kind of a,

864
00:41:52.867 --> 00:41:54.626
a very rainy kind of gloomy day,

865
00:41:54.626 --> 00:41:57.341
sort of like what we're having today in Sedona.

866
00:41:57.341 --> 00:42:00.606
And a lady came into the shop and she was

867
00:42:00.606 --> 00:42:03.566
very very grumpy because her tours had been cancelled.

868
00:42:03.566 --> 00:42:05.248
She was an out of towner, a tourist,

869
00:42:05.248 --> 00:42:06.875
as we have many of here.

870
00:42:06.875 --> 00:42:10.415
And she was planning on seeing this beautiful

871
00:42:10.415 --> 00:42:12.374
sun-lit region for that day.

872
00:42:12.374 --> 00:42:16.022
And so she went to the store just an alternative.

873
00:42:16.022 --> 00:42:18.354
You know, we go to the malls in rainy days.

874
00:42:18.354 --> 00:42:19.803
<v Voiceover>There are no malls here.</v>

875
00:42:19.803 --> 00:42:22.554
<v ->There are no malls here so she went to the shop.</v>

876
00:42:25.684 --> 00:42:30.684
According to the salesperson at the shop,

877
00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:36.236
she's a teacher, she's not really a salesperson but,

878
00:42:36.236 --> 00:42:38.471
she said that the customer was really

879
00:42:38.471 --> 00:42:41.146
more than she wanted to deal it at the moment.

880
00:42:44.405 --> 00:42:45.616
The customer said,

881
00:42:45.616 --> 00:42:47.188
"What do you have to show me that's interesting?"

882
00:42:47.188 --> 00:42:50.144
And she said, "Well, the most incredible thing

883
00:42:50.144 --> 00:42:52.965
"I can show you are these essential oils."

884
00:42:52.965 --> 00:42:55.914
And the customer said, "No, I hate essential oils."

885
00:42:55.914 --> 00:42:57.785
"Don't get them near me."

886
00:42:57.785 --> 00:43:02.785
So Barbara, who's our salesperson,

887
00:43:03.403 --> 00:43:05.651
she said, "Okay, what else would you like to see?"

888
00:43:05.651 --> 00:43:06.914
"I don't know."

889
00:43:06.914 --> 00:43:09.769
And in the meantime Barbara is just subtly opening

890
00:43:09.769 --> 00:43:13.215
this bottle of forgiveness on the counter.

891
00:43:13.215 --> 00:43:15.494
(laughter)

892
00:43:15.494 --> 00:43:19.256
And she just sets the bottle of forgiveness on the counter

893
00:43:19.256 --> 00:43:21.732
and the other person is just really accelerating

894
00:43:21.732 --> 00:43:25.096
in a grumpiness but she comes back in to the counter

895
00:43:25.096 --> 00:43:27.750
and she says, "Okay, give it to me."

896
00:43:28.721 --> 00:43:30.741
She picks it up and she smells it.

897
00:43:32.108 --> 00:43:36.725
And there's this relaxing of muscles on her face.

898
00:43:37.645 --> 00:43:40.225
And she says, "Well, I like that."

899
00:43:40.225 --> 00:43:41.197
"Why do I like that?"

900
00:43:41.197 --> 00:43:42.232
"I don't know why I like that."

901
00:43:42.232 --> 00:43:44.293
She's going into all of these reasons why

902
00:43:44.293 --> 00:43:47.428
she shouldn't like it, you could see her conscious faculty

903
00:43:47.428 --> 00:43:49.858
is telling her, "No, you're not supposed to like that

904
00:43:49.858 --> 00:43:52.997
"because we don't like essential oils."

905
00:43:52.997 --> 00:43:54.634
And she says, "But I like it."

906
00:43:54.634 --> 00:43:56.227
And she says, "Let me have some more."

907
00:43:56.227 --> 00:43:58.096
To get to the point of the story

908
00:43:58.096 --> 00:44:00.719
about five minutes later, she was actually sitting

909
00:44:00.719 --> 00:44:03.064
on the floor like a five-year-old

910
00:44:03.064 --> 00:44:05.616
with all of the bottles of oil around her

911
00:44:05.616 --> 00:44:10.172
laughing as high as a kite.

912
00:44:10.172 --> 00:44:11.481
<v Voiceover>Isn't that amazing?</v>

913
00:44:11.481 --> 00:44:14.354
<v ->And she said, "This is why I came to Sedona."</v>

914
00:44:15.809 --> 00:44:17.522
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

915
00:44:17.522 --> 00:44:22.522
It's really just incredible the speed at which these can

916
00:44:22.782 --> 00:44:25.057
affect people, the way I'm affected by them

917
00:44:25.057 --> 00:44:28.814
and always have been so strongly affected by essential oils.

918
00:44:28.814 --> 00:44:30.906
<v ->The first time I ever released them publicly,</v>

919
00:44:30.906 --> 00:44:35.505
I went to a health and wellness expo in Phoenix.

920
00:44:35.505 --> 00:44:38.200
And it had promises of being a good show

921
00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:41.711
and had attracted people from all over the country.

922
00:44:41.711 --> 00:44:43.320
But actually it wasn't.

923
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.974
Financially speaking, it was not a good experience

924
00:44:46.974 --> 00:44:48.375
for most people.

925
00:44:48.375 --> 00:44:50.717
And I think most people by the end of the first day

926
00:44:50.717 --> 00:44:53.247
were knowing that they were going to take a loss

927
00:44:53.247 --> 00:44:54.918
at that show.

928
00:44:54.918 --> 00:44:59.318
And everyone was coming to the essential oil booths.

929
00:44:59.318 --> 00:45:01.667
I had lines of people.

930
00:45:01.667 --> 00:45:04.642
I was probably the only one that did well at that show.

931
00:45:04.642 --> 00:45:08.220
They were coming, the word of mouth was out

932
00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:10.295
that this is what we came to the show for.

933
00:45:10.295 --> 00:45:12.667
And before it was all over you could feel

934
00:45:12.667 --> 00:45:16.294
a party in the room, literally.

935
00:45:16.294 --> 00:45:19.361
People were, they had lost large amounts of money

936
00:45:19.361 --> 00:45:21.279
coming to the show making very few sales

937
00:45:21.279 --> 00:45:22.993
because very few people attended.

938
00:45:22.993 --> 00:45:25.209
It had not been a well promoted show.

939
00:45:25.209 --> 00:45:30.209
But there was a spirit of joy and celebration in the room

940
00:45:31.735 --> 00:45:34.230
all focused around the essential oils.

941
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:37.746
That's a good example of what I mean by

942
00:45:37.746 --> 00:45:39.742
a conspiracy of enlightenment,

943
00:45:39.742 --> 00:45:43.951
that the oils will do something to trigger

944
00:45:43.951 --> 00:45:47.712
a body recognition that we have within our self,

945
00:45:47.712 --> 00:45:49.840
all the resources we need.

946
00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:53.748
And then a spiritual support for that recognition

947
00:45:53.748 --> 00:45:57.676
that takes us around (mumbles) to tell us that something is

948
00:45:57.676 --> 00:45:59.761
A, not a success or B,

949
00:46:01.541 --> 00:46:03.389
not valuable to do,

950
00:46:03.389 --> 00:46:05.658
or an unrewarding experience.

951
00:46:05.658 --> 00:46:06.998
So as it turns out,

952
00:46:06.998 --> 00:46:10.197
people began to network at the show.

953
00:46:10.197 --> 00:46:12.815
And not just about the oils, about everything.

954
00:46:12.815 --> 00:46:15.906
And it became a very powerful networking experience

955
00:46:15.906 --> 00:46:17.873
for everyone who came with the show

956
00:46:17.873 --> 00:46:19.929
and the sharing of information.

957
00:46:19.929 --> 00:46:22.489
Most people concluded that they came to the show

958
00:46:22.489 --> 00:46:24.937
to meet other dealers and to network.

959
00:46:24.937 --> 00:46:27.937
And it was this that facilitated that recognition.

960
00:46:27.937 --> 00:46:29.886
So through the networking and the sharing of

961
00:46:29.886 --> 00:46:34.115
vital information, they gained something more valuable

962
00:46:34.115 --> 00:46:38.018
than the financial remuneration they would have received

963
00:46:38.018 --> 00:46:42.198
from just dealing with the public that didn't

964
00:46:42.198 --> 00:46:44.175
arrive in very--

965
00:46:44.175 --> 00:46:45.345
<v Voiceiver>In the numbers expected.</v>

966
00:46:45.345 --> 00:46:46.418
Yeah, sure.

967
00:46:46.418 --> 00:46:47.432
<v ->The numbers expected because the promotion</v>

968
00:46:47.432 --> 00:46:49.567
was just not done effectively.

969
00:46:49.567 --> 00:46:52.302
<v Voiceover>So if we were to take</v>

970
00:46:52.302 --> 00:46:55.985
matters into our own hands and become our own

971
00:46:55.985 --> 00:46:58.476
priests and priestesses and alchemists in our homes

972
00:46:58.476 --> 00:46:59.745
and in our offices,

973
00:46:59.745 --> 00:47:01.987
might it be a good idea to take a few of our

974
00:47:01.987 --> 00:47:04.237
favorite bottles of the oils and

975
00:47:04.237 --> 00:47:06.943
just maybe have them on our desk at work

976
00:47:06.943 --> 00:47:08.615
and let people be drawn to them and say,

977
00:47:08.615 --> 00:47:10.358
may I have a sniff of that?

978
00:47:10.358 --> 00:47:12.781
Or to leave them out in the kitchen area

979
00:47:12.781 --> 00:47:14.676
where everyone passes through for breakfast in the morning

980
00:47:14.676 --> 00:47:17.842
and if they're drawn to put a drop here and there,

981
00:47:17.842 --> 00:47:18.886
is that a good way to do it

982
00:47:18.886 --> 00:47:22.246
just make them out in public and available to

983
00:47:22.246 --> 00:47:23.658
the experience?

984
00:47:23.658 --> 00:47:24.736
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

985
00:47:24.736 --> 00:47:25.565
<v Voiceover>Rather than keeping them</v>

986
00:47:25.565 --> 00:47:26.747
in our special little place in the bathroom

987
00:47:26.747 --> 00:47:28.261
just for us.

988
00:47:28.261 --> 00:47:29.565
<v ->Yeah, don't do that.</v>

989
00:47:29.565 --> 00:47:31.060
No, don't do that.

990
00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.466
I have another story for you.

991
00:47:33.646 --> 00:47:35.531
It's a mother with her teenage daughter.

992
00:47:35.531 --> 00:47:37.805
Her teenage daughter was going through the teens

993
00:47:37.805 --> 00:47:39.377
and she was incorrigible.

994
00:47:40.805 --> 00:47:43.617
They were having not only disciplinary problems with

995
00:47:43.617 --> 00:47:45.815
her but lots of attitude problems,

996
00:47:45.815 --> 00:47:50.030
even some health problems and school problems.

997
00:47:52.395 --> 00:47:55.536
The daughter was very resentful that her mother

998
00:47:55.536 --> 00:47:58.921
was into spiritual

999
00:48:00.077 --> 00:48:04.165
modalities because she felt that

1000
00:48:04.165 --> 00:48:05.801
the mother was just above and beyond

1001
00:48:05.801 --> 00:48:07.153
anything she could understand,

1002
00:48:07.153 --> 00:48:08.610
she was just going way beyond what

1003
00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:10.131
the family could understand.

1004
00:48:10.131 --> 00:48:11.369
And after all--

1005
00:48:11.369 --> 00:48:12.540
<v Voiceover>We've gone woo woo on them.</v>

1006
00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:13.875
<v ->She's gone woo woo on them.</v>

1007
00:48:13.875 --> 00:48:15.254
She's out there.

1008
00:48:16.921 --> 00:48:18.512
So the mother just left,

1009
00:48:18.512 --> 00:48:22.188
I don't really recall the particulars of which one

1010
00:48:22.188 --> 00:48:26.018
she left on the dining room table but she just left it there

1011
00:48:26.018 --> 00:48:27.655
all the time and said nothing.

1012
00:48:27.655 --> 00:48:29.947
She realized that this is,

1013
00:48:29.947 --> 00:48:32.219
that there was not going to be anything accomplished

1014
00:48:32.219 --> 00:48:34.063
through engaging an argument.

1015
00:48:34.063 --> 00:48:36.209
But she just left it there.

1016
00:48:36.209 --> 00:48:39.633
And one day, her daughter came in

1017
00:48:39.633 --> 00:48:42.953
and she said, "Mom, I got it.

1018
00:48:44.529 --> 00:48:46.969
"I don't know how I got it, but I got it."

1019
00:48:48.312 --> 00:48:50.868
She said, " I realized what you're doing,

1020
00:48:50.868 --> 00:48:54.722
"is that you're just not

1021
00:48:54.722 --> 00:48:57.534
"focusing upon the problems in life,

1022
00:48:57.534 --> 00:49:00.662
"you're focusing upon the solutions."

1023
00:49:00.662 --> 00:49:02.078
<v Voiceover>Wow.</v>

1024
00:49:02.078 --> 00:49:04.092
There are a lot of mothers out here listening to this

1025
00:49:04.092 --> 00:49:06.371
that will be happy to hear this.

1026
00:49:06.371 --> 00:49:10.439
<v ->And it was done subtly by just affecting</v>

1027
00:49:10.439 --> 00:49:14.288
the part of her daughter that seeks solutions.

1028
00:49:14.288 --> 00:49:16.602
One of the things I think we've all realized

1029
00:49:16.602 --> 00:49:19.534
is that even though

1030
00:49:19.534 --> 00:49:22.151
we have a great regard for our conscious faculty,

1031
00:49:22.151 --> 00:49:25.143
and I've spent a lot of my years enhancing it

1032
00:49:25.143 --> 00:49:28.188
with college degrees and with study and reading,

1033
00:49:28.188 --> 00:49:30.844
and I'm very appreciative of that faculty

1034
00:49:30.844 --> 00:49:32.452
and honor it.

1035
00:49:32.452 --> 00:49:35.983
So much of our conscious faculty is focused on problems,

1036
00:49:37.249 --> 00:49:39.632
figuring out what they are,

1037
00:49:39.632 --> 00:49:43.280
figuring out the mechanics of solving them,

1038
00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:46.446
figuring out how they happened in the first place,

1039
00:49:46.446 --> 00:49:51.079
and how other people are in involved in our problems.

1040
00:49:51.079 --> 00:49:53.701
In other words, a lot of our conscious faculty

1041
00:49:53.701 --> 00:49:55.680
is problem oriented.

1042
00:49:56.612 --> 00:49:57.715
<v Voiceover>A lot of our conversation</v>

1043
00:49:57.715 --> 00:49:59.673
with others is problem oriented.

1044
00:49:59.673 --> 00:50:00.729
<v ->That's correct.</v>

1045
00:50:00.729 --> 00:50:02.371
And so through our conscious faculty

1046
00:50:02.371 --> 00:50:03.913
we engage with problems.

1047
00:50:03.913 --> 00:50:06.380
And sometimes this is very beneficial,

1048
00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:08.965
sometimes it gets out of control.

1049
00:50:08.965 --> 00:50:12.765
Sometimes it just creates an overwhelmed

1050
00:50:14.112 --> 00:50:17.455
difficulty with life because we don't have the answers

1051
00:50:17.455 --> 00:50:18.868
in our conscious faculty.

1052
00:50:18.868 --> 00:50:21.028
We have them at a higher level

1053
00:50:21.028 --> 00:50:24.068
and we have them at a symbiotic level.

1054
00:50:24.068 --> 00:50:27.021
Our body is innately symbiotic.

1055
00:50:27.021 --> 00:50:31.545
It's symbiotic with the earth, with our fellow human being.

1056
00:50:32.621 --> 00:50:36.274
It's symbiotic with the cosmos, nature,

1057
00:50:36.274 --> 00:50:39.398
the electromagnetic frequencies from which

1058
00:50:39.398 --> 00:50:41.064
we are literally created.

1059
00:50:42.112 --> 00:50:44.203
It is innately symbiotic.

1060
00:50:44.203 --> 00:50:48.209
And through this symbiosis it has access to solutions

1061
00:50:48.209 --> 00:50:52.160
far beyond its own experience.

1062
00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:55.911
And the spirit is innately connected.

1063
00:50:58.887 --> 00:51:02.114
And so both of those faculties are solution oriented.

1064
00:51:04.315 --> 00:51:05.544
<v Voiceover>It's true.</v>

1065
00:51:06.747 --> 00:51:09.931
And your oils are wonderful catalyst.

1066
00:51:09.931 --> 00:51:10.849
Wonderful catalyst.

1067
00:51:10.849 --> 00:51:13.616
So obviously you've done so much work internally

1068
00:51:13.616 --> 00:51:15.033
within your own being.

1069
00:51:15.033 --> 00:51:16.234
You've gained such

1070
00:51:17.685 --> 00:51:19.515
refined levels of knowledge,

1071
00:51:19.515 --> 00:51:23.114
that is why people are responding to your oils

1072
00:51:23.114 --> 00:51:24.040
the way they are.

1073
00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.694
There's no doubt in my mind about it.

1074
00:51:25.694 --> 00:51:27.656
And you can see the radiance that comes through you

1075
00:51:27.656 --> 00:51:29.156
is coming through your oils.

1076
00:51:29.156 --> 00:51:32.195
And well, I can't thank you enough for taking

1077
00:51:32.195 --> 00:51:34.722
the time to be here and for creating these oils

1078
00:51:34.722 --> 00:51:35.616
for all of us.

1079
00:51:35.616 --> 00:51:37.941
And I'd like to say before we sign off here,

1080
00:51:37.941 --> 00:51:39.543
if there's anyone last comment,

1081
00:51:39.543 --> 00:51:41.416
anything that you'd like to say to wrap it up

1082
00:51:41.416 --> 00:51:44.083
or if you feel complete.

1083
00:51:44.083 --> 00:51:46.613
<v ->I feel very complete.</v>

1084
00:51:46.613 --> 00:51:50.339
And I think perhaps that is the summary

1085
00:51:50.339 --> 00:51:53.107
because these oils were created to help us

1086
00:51:53.107 --> 00:51:55.863
recognize our completeness.

1087
00:51:55.863 --> 00:51:59.889
We're not complete because we've gotten something else,

1088
00:51:59.889 --> 00:52:03.128
because we've added a little more to our life,

1089
00:52:03.128 --> 00:52:05.241
we're complete because we recognize

1090
00:52:05.241 --> 00:52:06.904
that we don't have to add anything.

1091
00:52:06.904 --> 00:52:10.516
(calm music)

1092
00:52:10.516 --> 00:52:12.386
<v ->I highly encourage anyone who is looking</v>

1093
00:52:12.386 --> 00:52:15.041
to begin our journey into expanded awareness

1094
00:52:15.041 --> 00:52:17.253
to begin exploring the profound and subtle effects

1095
00:52:17.253 --> 00:52:18.609
of essential oils.

1096
00:52:18.609 --> 00:52:21.246
In my experience, Glenda's sacred oil blends

1097
00:52:21.246 --> 00:52:24.428
are of a particularly high frequency for facilitating

1098
00:52:24.428 --> 00:52:26.720
change in my experience anyway.

1099
00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.600
You might also pick up a copy of her book

1100
00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:31.207
Anointed with Oil, The Power of Scent

1101
00:52:31.207 --> 00:52:33.682
to begin this gentle and beautiful journey.

1102
00:52:33.682 --> 00:52:36.113
Until next time, thanks for watching.

1103
00:52:36.113 --> 00:52:40.874
