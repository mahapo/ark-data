00:00:00.463 --> 00:00:03.624
<v ->A sociologist by trade, Dr. Chet Snow found himself</v>

2
00:00:03.624 --> 00:00:05.892
on a profound journey into the future

3
00:00:05.892 --> 00:00:07.726
after meeting Helen Wambach,

4
00:00:07.726 --> 00:00:10.528
one of the pioneers in the field of past-life regression

5
00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:12.830
and future life progression.

6
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.200
As they collaborated on their book, Mass Dreams

7
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.752
of the Future, Chet began finding mysterious clues

8
00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:21.239
from the Hopi elders and crop circles

9
00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.308
as to what lies ahead for all of us.

10
00:00:23.308 --> 00:00:26.077
One of the most mystifying pieces is what he calls

11
00:00:26.077 --> 00:00:29.363
a ten-year reprieve from the prophesied events.

12
00:00:39.157 --> 00:00:41.528
<v Regina>Your work with Helen Wambach</v>

13
00:00:41.528 --> 00:00:43.195
seems to be a really pivotal point,

14
00:00:43.195 --> 00:00:45.197
not only in your life, but in the work that you created

15
00:00:45.197 --> 00:00:47.566
from that point forward which is really critical.

16
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.367
And that is the work in regression,

17
00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:52.137
slash, progression therapy.

18
00:00:52.137 --> 00:00:54.740
If you could give a little idea of how this came about

19
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.342
in your life leading into the book that you were

20
00:00:57.342 --> 00:01:00.145
to co-write and you ended up doing on your own.

21
00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:02.017
<v ->Right, and of course that book is Mass Dreams</v>

22
00:01:02.017 --> 00:01:03.915
of the Future, which was first published

23
00:01:03.915 --> 00:01:05.917
nearly 20 years ago now.

24
00:01:05.917 --> 00:01:09.821
And it all came about because I think I've discussed this

25
00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:10.688
in other places.

26
00:01:10.688 --> 00:01:12.791
My grandmother, to whom I was very close,

27
00:01:12.791 --> 00:01:16.161
passed away and after her passing I had some

28
00:01:16.161 --> 00:01:18.764
very strong psychic visions of her.

29
00:01:18.764 --> 00:01:21.201
In one of these visions, one of the last ones in fact,

30
00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:23.968
that we were together which must have been

31
00:01:23.968 --> 00:01:26.704
January or February of 1983,

32
00:01:26.704 --> 00:01:28.940
she told me quite clearly, you're going to meet

33
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.743
a woman named Helen and she's in Berkeley.

34
00:01:31.743 --> 00:01:33.911
And she's the one that you're to work with.

35
00:01:33.911 --> 00:01:37.749
Essentially telling me I have other things to do,

36
00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:40.017
so I'm turning you over to somebody

37
00:01:40.017 --> 00:01:42.520
who's in a physical body, let me put it that way.

38
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.726
Within 72 hours I was at a meeting about something else

39
00:01:46.726 --> 00:01:49.293
when quite out of the blue an acquaintance of mine

40
00:01:49.293 --> 00:01:51.929
came in telling about her regression session

41
00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.232
with Dr. Helen Wambach of Berkeley,

42
00:01:54.232 --> 00:01:56.735
which clearly got my attention.

43
00:01:56.735 --> 00:01:58.637
I was able to get Helen's phone number

44
00:01:58.637 --> 00:02:02.774
and went to see her, first of all, to try to make some sense

45
00:02:02.774 --> 00:02:04.375
out of what was happening to me.

46
00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:09.375
Why me who, I never credited myself as a psychic

47
00:02:10.215 --> 00:02:11.449
in any way.

48
00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:14.418
My grandmother and I, yes we're very close,

49
00:02:14.418 --> 00:02:17.955
but as far as I knew, she had been a lifelong Methodist

50
00:02:17.955 --> 00:02:20.391
and didn't have much truck with new age.

51
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:21.593
<v Regina>It wasn't on the menu.</v>

52
00:02:21.593 --> 00:02:22.794
<v ->No, no it wasn't on the menu.</v>

53
00:02:22.794 --> 00:02:26.498
I have to admit I have a rather normal, boring

54
00:02:26.498 --> 00:02:27.799
mid-American background

55
00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.236
from the middle Atlantic states

56
00:02:31.236 --> 00:02:32.971
of the Eastern United States.

57
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:34.872
And this time I was out in California

58
00:02:34.872 --> 00:02:36.074
working for the government,

59
00:02:36.074 --> 00:02:38.110
working out at Travis Air Force Base,

60
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.585
which of course, isn't too far from Berkeley.

61
00:02:39.585 --> 00:02:41.179
So it wasn't out of the question

62
00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:43.048
I'd meet somebody from Berkeley.

63
00:02:43.048 --> 00:02:45.387
But when all this happened my first session with Helen

64
00:02:45.387 --> 00:02:47.320
is something that's imprinted on my memory.

65
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.323
It was really amazing because what I saw

66
00:02:51.323 --> 00:02:55.627
I didn't understand, but it plunged me back into

67
00:02:55.627 --> 00:02:58.463
what I now understand to have been the Crusades

68
00:02:58.463 --> 00:03:01.500
and what are called the Cathars, which were a group,

69
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.073
a heretical group in Southern France.

70
00:03:04.073 --> 00:03:06.204
My background is part French.

71
00:03:06.204 --> 00:03:08.273
I am partly French, so I spoke French.

72
00:03:08.273 --> 00:03:10.312
So none of this was too surprising.

73
00:03:10.312 --> 00:03:12.844
But when she asked me was I French,

74
00:03:12.844 --> 00:03:14.145
it was really amazing.

75
00:03:14.145 --> 00:03:16.115
Something deep within me said no.

76
00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:19.417
And I was very strong about this, I am Gascogne.

77
00:03:19.417 --> 00:03:21.786
Well, if you've ever seen Cyrano de Bergerac,

78
00:03:21.786 --> 00:03:24.490
you know that the Gascogne people are strong.

79
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.995
Even today they still consider themselves Gascognes first,

80
00:03:26.995 --> 00:03:28.327
and French second.

81
00:03:28.327 --> 00:03:31.363
Anyway, that's where I went back to.

82
00:03:31.363 --> 00:03:33.231
And I realized my grandmother had been my mother

83
00:03:33.231 --> 00:03:35.867
in that time experience.

84
00:03:35.867 --> 00:03:39.470
She had taught me many things that later on

85
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.474
came out in why our relationship was so close,

86
00:03:42.474 --> 00:03:44.609
and why she was able to come through essentially

87
00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.878
from the other side.

88
00:03:46.878 --> 00:03:49.548
Now Helen had been doing scientific research.

89
00:03:49.548 --> 00:03:51.483
She was of course, a clinical psychologist,

90
00:03:51.483 --> 00:03:55.553
but very interested in putting together statistically

91
00:03:55.553 --> 00:03:58.693
a concept of reincarnation that wouldn't just

92
00:03:58.693 --> 00:04:00.594
be anecdotal stories.

93
00:04:00.594 --> 00:04:02.427
That would somehow go beyond that.

94
00:04:02.427 --> 00:04:06.431
Her book, Reliving Past Lives, was the first time

95
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:08.699
that someone had really taken more than stories,

96
00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:12.337
but taken whole groups of people to specific time periods

97
00:04:12.337 --> 00:04:15.572
in the past and then compared their stories statistically

98
00:04:15.572 --> 00:04:18.610
and found that there were correlations

99
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.913
that went beyond the laws of probability.

100
00:04:21.913 --> 00:04:23.414
In other words, they were much more probable

101
00:04:23.414 --> 00:04:25.122
than chance.

102
00:04:25.122 --> 00:04:27.451
Now, I'm a sociologist and historian.

103
00:04:27.451 --> 00:04:31.690
And this concept of this work in sort of background

104
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.025
of sociology really fascinated me.

105
00:04:34.025 --> 00:04:36.128
And then she was doing this work

106
00:04:36.128 --> 00:04:39.999
and she realized at some point that people were telling her

107
00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:43.271
you know, your voice was going on and on

108
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:46.337
with these questions, but I was getting answers

109
00:04:46.337 --> 00:04:48.173
before you asked the questions.

110
00:04:48.173 --> 00:04:50.742
I was flashing into the material,

111
00:04:50.742 --> 00:04:52.977
sometimes even up to a minute or more,

112
00:04:52.977 --> 00:04:55.614
before I was hearing your voice asking me.

113
00:04:55.614 --> 00:04:57.715
And then it would make a connection for me

114
00:04:57.715 --> 00:04:58.650
and I'd realize.

115
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.722
So, she said as a scientist and someone

116
00:05:01.722 --> 00:05:05.156
interested in psychology, how would this be?

117
00:05:05.156 --> 00:05:08.726
Why would these people be getting the information?

118
00:05:08.726 --> 00:05:11.662
And she realized that she was in fact thinking

119
00:05:11.662 --> 00:05:13.198
two or three lines ahead.

120
00:05:13.198 --> 00:05:17.002
She knew her text, she had a script that she had memorized

121
00:05:17.002 --> 00:05:19.270
in order to do exactly the same thing

122
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.240
for literally dozens of groups around the country.

123
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.842
Her mind she said, was ahead and therefore

124
00:05:24.842 --> 00:05:26.211
they were picking up subconsciously

125
00:05:26.211 --> 00:05:28.379
a telepathic communication.

126
00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:29.948
So she said, well if that's true,

127
00:05:29.948 --> 00:05:33.685
and the subconscious mind can go outside of time this way

128
00:05:33.685 --> 00:05:37.022
maybe it would go forward and we could get information

129
00:05:37.022 --> 00:05:38.422
about the future.

130
00:05:38.422 --> 00:05:40.357
One of her quotes that I love was,

131
00:05:40.357 --> 00:05:43.328
why go to one psychic when we can have hundreds?

132
00:05:43.328 --> 00:05:44.797
(laughing)

133
00:05:44.797 --> 00:05:46.565
So she was a practical and very funny lady.

134
00:05:46.565 --> 00:05:48.368
She had a great sense of humor.

135
00:05:48.368 --> 00:05:53.368
She had started a project called Mass Dreams

136
00:05:53.605 --> 00:05:57.409
of the Future where she included two future time periods

137
00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:59.711
and three past time periods,

138
00:05:59.711 --> 00:06:02.413
allowing people's subconscious mind to choose

139
00:06:02.413 --> 00:06:04.819
which one they would go to in the sessions

140
00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:07.285
that she was doing, these group sessions.

141
00:06:07.285 --> 00:06:08.720
At that time I don't know if she'd done any

142
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.788
future individual sessions.

143
00:06:10.788 --> 00:06:12.893
I don't think so.

144
00:06:12.893 --> 00:06:15.777
My memory is that she was working with groups for this.

145
00:06:15.777 --> 00:06:18.696
When I got started with her she said,

146
00:06:18.696 --> 00:06:19.932
well two things about me.

147
00:06:19.932 --> 00:06:22.000
One thing was that I was very good

148
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.302
at regression work.

149
00:06:24.302 --> 00:06:26.141
It just turned out that that's a,

150
00:06:26.141 --> 00:06:27.442
<v Regina>Being regressed, or regressing others?</v>

151
00:06:27.442 --> 00:06:28.274
<v ->Both, apparently.</v>

152
00:06:28.274 --> 00:06:29.076
<v Regina>Both, okay.</v>

153
00:06:29.076 --> 00:06:30.875
<v ->Both, I mean at the time I was being regressed.</v>

154
00:06:30.875 --> 00:06:32.944
But what she said, it's like riding a bicycle.

155
00:06:32.944 --> 00:06:35.329
Once you learn you don't,

156
00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:36.213
and if you could ride a bicycle

157
00:06:36.213 --> 00:06:38.483
you can teach somebody to ride a bicycle.

158
00:06:38.483 --> 00:06:40.718
Because it's an innate skill, it's something that you have,

159
00:06:40.718 --> 00:06:42.353
like a piano or bicycle.

160
00:06:42.353 --> 00:06:45.789
She said that she wanted to try this with me

161
00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:47.491
on an individual basis.

162
00:06:47.491 --> 00:06:50.362
That's how we started the first sessions

163
00:06:50.362 --> 00:06:51.830
that ended up being the first chapter

164
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.465
of Mass Dreams of the Future,

165
00:06:53.465 --> 00:06:57.068
which were these progressions done in the early 1980s

166
00:06:57.068 --> 00:07:00.438
out in, near Berkeley, California.

167
00:07:00.438 --> 00:07:04.776
I was suddenly catapulted ahead in this lifetime

168
00:07:04.776 --> 00:07:09.280
into the 1990s and early 2000 time period,

169
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.817
seeing myself in Arizona, seeing myself out on a ranch,

170
00:07:12.817 --> 00:07:13.618
kind of isolated.

171
00:07:13.618 --> 00:07:17.125
Seeing a lot of changes taking place in the world.

172
00:07:17.125 --> 00:07:18.359
Seeing myself surrounded with people

173
00:07:18.359 --> 00:07:22.360
that I had no idea who they were back in 1982 or '83.

174
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.199
That's kind of where that whole thing started from.

175
00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:30.468
What I found was that

176
00:07:30.468 --> 00:07:32.237
I needed to put it in some kind of perspective

177
00:07:32.237 --> 00:07:35.708
for me at that time.

178
00:07:35.708 --> 00:07:37.209
She was very good with this and that's why

179
00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:38.944
we did regressions and progressions

180
00:07:38.944 --> 00:07:42.346
kind of interchangeably for the next two years.

181
00:07:42.346 --> 00:07:45.219
So that I understood where some of this was coming from

182
00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:47.718
just as I figured out the relationship with my grandmother

183
00:07:47.718 --> 00:07:49.520
and what that meant,

184
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.089
in the very first session that we ever did,

185
00:07:52.089 --> 00:07:54.058
well later we went into more.

186
00:07:54.058 --> 00:07:55.926
And I realized that there were other reasons

187
00:07:55.926 --> 00:07:57.496
why I was, in a sense,

188
00:07:57.496 --> 00:08:00.298
self chosen to do this particular work

189
00:08:00.298 --> 00:08:04.068
and why we met at the time we did.

190
00:08:04.068 --> 00:08:05.904
When in fact, she was essentially getting ready

191
00:08:05.904 --> 00:08:07.439
to leave her body.

192
00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:09.707
She was quite ill, and she realized she wasn't

193
00:08:09.707 --> 00:08:12.509
going to be able to write this book.

194
00:08:12.509 --> 00:08:14.612
She said to me, you have a research bump.

195
00:08:14.612 --> 00:08:16.815
Well, I looked around and I haven't found it yet.

196
00:08:16.815 --> 00:08:18.249
But that's what she kept telling me,

197
00:08:18.249 --> 00:08:19.217
that I had a research bump,

198
00:08:19.217 --> 00:08:21.352
meaning that I liked to do research.

199
00:08:21.352 --> 00:08:23.755
And she said that's rather rare, especially with people

200
00:08:23.755 --> 00:08:24.922
who have psychic ability.

201
00:08:24.922 --> 00:08:28.225
Most of them, if they do have that intuitive psychic ability

202
00:08:28.225 --> 00:08:30.294
they don't want to put it into a quantitative

203
00:08:30.294 --> 00:08:32.063
qualitative kind of work.

204
00:08:32.063 --> 00:08:32.997
<v Regina>Very true, yes.</v>

205
00:08:32.997 --> 00:08:34.669
<v ->They want to tell stories.</v>

206
00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:37.069
Although I like to tell stories, too,

207
00:08:37.069 --> 00:08:39.236
it's something that I've always enjoyed doing.

208
00:08:39.236 --> 00:08:42.640
So the whole statistical part of Mass Dreams of the Future

209
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.009
where we took the progression experiences,

210
00:08:45.009 --> 00:08:47.079
because I went ahead and then did my own

211
00:08:47.079 --> 00:08:49.083
progression experiences for several years

212
00:08:49.083 --> 00:08:52.416
after her passing, I then took it

213
00:08:52.416 --> 00:08:56.254
and using my own background as a sociologist

214
00:08:56.254 --> 00:08:59.190
put them together into the charts and graphs.

215
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.409
A lot of people said that's not the best part of the book.

216
00:09:01.409 --> 00:09:03.394
But I love that part of the book.

217
00:09:03.394 --> 00:09:04.996
To me, it backs up the rest.

218
00:09:04.996 --> 00:09:09.702
And that's what's solid in my opinion.

219
00:09:09.702 --> 00:09:12.336
Those were the experiences that I had with Helen

220
00:09:12.336 --> 00:09:16.073
primarily was very personal going into these

221
00:09:16.073 --> 00:09:18.376
near-term future experiences.

222
00:09:18.376 --> 00:09:23.376
Some of which, if you've seen the book, are rather dramatic.

223
00:09:23.447 --> 00:09:26.451
Not all of which have happened, which is also good.

224
00:09:26.451 --> 00:09:27.985
<v Regina>We're going to get into this.</v>

225
00:09:27.985 --> 00:09:29.787
<v ->Yeah, not all of which have happened, thank goodness.</v>

226
00:09:29.787 --> 00:09:32.323
I'm actually very happy some of them haven't happened.

227
00:09:32.323 --> 00:09:34.661
I realize that I've made some choices based

228
00:09:34.661 --> 00:09:39.530
on those experiences that changed that future.

229
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.533
And then the other thing was these group experiences

230
00:09:42.533 --> 00:09:44.468
with sometimes hundreds of people.

231
00:09:44.468 --> 00:09:46.771
Usually in the dozens.

232
00:09:46.771 --> 00:09:49.440
Helen was a triple Leo, so she loved crowds.

233
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.549
She loved big groups.

234
00:09:50.549 --> 00:09:53.181
I'm a Cancer, I like more intimate settings

235
00:09:53.181 --> 00:09:56.248
of 25, 30 people is a good group for me.

236
00:09:56.248 --> 00:10:00.384
Helen, if it was under 100 it's not worth her time.

237
00:10:00.384 --> 00:10:02.620
She was that triple Leo going out there

238
00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.488
putting her face into the world.

239
00:10:04.488 --> 00:10:07.091
In fact, I remember so well she was quite ill

240
00:10:07.091 --> 00:10:08.359
at the end of her life.

241
00:10:08.359 --> 00:10:11.695
And she would go out and be on stage,

242
00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:13.831
and I would help her out before the curtain would open

243
00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:15.834
and sit her in a chair.

244
00:10:15.834 --> 00:10:18.002
Then she would go on stage and for two hours

245
00:10:18.002 --> 00:10:20.938
she would give it all.

246
00:10:20.938 --> 00:10:23.207
You would never know anything was wrong with her.

247
00:10:23.207 --> 00:10:24.976
And the audience would applaud.

248
00:10:24.976 --> 00:10:26.911
She'd give a lecture or do a progression session

249
00:10:26.911 --> 00:10:28.179
or whatever it was.

250
00:10:28.179 --> 00:10:30.447
The curtains would close and she would.

251
00:10:30.447 --> 00:10:32.149
And I would help her,

252
00:10:32.149 --> 00:10:36.287
an invalid back into the car and take her home.

253
00:10:36.287 --> 00:10:38.122
And I saw that more than once.

254
00:10:38.122 --> 00:10:39.865
It was very touching in a way,

255
00:10:39.865 --> 00:10:42.092
but she had that presence that comes across.

256
00:10:42.092 --> 00:10:43.760
I'm sure you've met other people that have that.

257
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.098
They have charisma, and they're leaders.

258
00:10:46.098 --> 00:10:49.700
And they get people to follow them because of that.

259
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.169
I don't claim to have that.

260
00:10:51.169 --> 00:10:56.014
My work is more intimate and allow one-on-one.

261
00:10:56.014 --> 00:10:57.610
But what I learned from the progression work

262
00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:02.213
for myself was that first of all, it's rather difficult

263
00:11:02.213 --> 00:11:05.449
to go into the near-term future.

264
00:11:05.449 --> 00:11:06.985
Helen was right.

265
00:11:06.985 --> 00:11:10.321
I found only five to 10 percent of people can do that

266
00:11:10.321 --> 00:11:12.056
with any kind of accuracy.

267
00:11:12.056 --> 00:11:17.056
There seems to be almost like a failsafe in our brain.

268
00:11:17.695 --> 00:11:20.031
Helen used to say your liver wants to live.

269
00:11:20.031 --> 00:11:21.798
It doesn't want to know about entropy.

270
00:11:21.798 --> 00:11:23.500
It doesn't want to know about the body getting old.

271
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.769
We all have to have a projection of our self somewhere

272
00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:29.640
that's maybe in our 30s or late 20s.

273
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.976
<v Regina>Or 36.</v>

274
00:11:30.976 --> 00:11:32.279
<v ->There you go.</v>

275
00:11:32.279 --> 00:11:33.077
<v Regina>Or 28.</v>

276
00:11:33.077 --> 00:11:35.379
<v ->28, 36, somewhere in there in that time frame of our life</v>

277
00:11:35.379 --> 00:11:37.748
unless obviously if we're only 20 years old

278
00:11:37.748 --> 00:11:39.122
we're not to there yet.

279
00:11:39.122 --> 00:11:42.954
But if we're older than that and we keep that.

280
00:11:42.954 --> 00:11:45.089
And one thing I learned with my grandmother

281
00:11:45.089 --> 00:11:47.159
as she was coming back to me

282
00:11:47.159 --> 00:11:48.760
they were very visual experiences.

283
00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.629
She got younger, and by the end of that experience

284
00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:53.431
she was about 20 years old.

285
00:11:53.431 --> 00:11:56.835
And I had never seen her at 20 years old,

286
00:11:56.835 --> 00:12:00.505
so it was a great fascination for me to see her long,

287
00:12:00.505 --> 00:12:02.551
jet black hair that apparently had been

288
00:12:02.551 --> 00:12:05.117
her pride and joy, went down to her waist.

289
00:12:05.117 --> 00:12:08.481
And she could ride horseback and bareback.

290
00:12:08.481 --> 00:12:10.991
And in fact, she had told me that earlier

291
00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:12.450
that she was a pioneer.

292
00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.953
She walked halfway across the United States.

293
00:12:14.953 --> 00:12:17.256
And she said that she had to out ride people.

294
00:12:17.256 --> 00:12:19.457
That they'd get drunk in the saloons and the girls

295
00:12:19.457 --> 00:12:21.593
would drive around the ponies and they would go off

296
00:12:21.593 --> 00:12:23.261
into the bush.

297
00:12:23.261 --> 00:12:25.396
<v Regina>What a privilege you got to see her in this way.</v>

298
00:12:25.396 --> 00:12:28.403
<v ->I was very, very privileged to get to see her in this way.</v>

299
00:12:28.403 --> 00:12:30.535
<v Regina>So now, as you continue going through</v>

300
00:12:30.535 --> 00:12:34.571
the death finally, of Helen and you started

301
00:12:34.571 --> 00:12:36.543
on your experiments, you went back to Europe.

302
00:12:36.543 --> 00:12:37.241
<v ->Yes, I did.</v>

303
00:12:37.241 --> 00:12:40.377
<v Regina>And let's get into the meat of some</v>

304
00:12:40.377 --> 00:12:42.446
of the specifics of what you started seeing

305
00:12:42.446 --> 00:12:44.649
was crossing all cultural barriers in terms of

306
00:12:44.649 --> 00:12:46.885
the Mass Dreams of the Future.

307
00:12:46.885 --> 00:12:47.752
What did you see?

308
00:12:47.752 --> 00:12:52.752
I want to go from there into what has reconditioned itself

309
00:12:53.257 --> 00:12:55.726
and is turning out a little differently than what you saw?

310
00:12:55.726 --> 00:12:57.328
And what is to come now?

311
00:12:57.328 --> 00:12:58.929
And I want to pass through that whole

312
00:12:58.929 --> 00:13:00.331
Hopi connection along the way.

313
00:13:00.331 --> 00:13:01.699
And crop circles, of course.

314
00:13:01.699 --> 00:13:03.600
<v ->Lots of interesting things have happened.</v>

315
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.470
And as you said quite rightly,

316
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.439
meeting Helen wasn't just a chance thing.

317
00:13:09.439 --> 00:13:11.475
Obviously there was something behind it.

318
00:13:11.475 --> 00:13:13.544
My grandmother and I must have, at another level

319
00:13:13.544 --> 00:13:16.047
made a plan about that for a long time.

320
00:13:16.047 --> 00:13:17.648
Because I really do think that if I had not had

321
00:13:17.648 --> 00:13:20.118
that connection and changed my life around,

322
00:13:20.118 --> 00:13:21.252
I might not even be here.

323
00:13:21.252 --> 00:13:24.555
I might have chosen not to stay in this incarnation.

324
00:13:24.555 --> 00:13:26.624
I wasn't very happy in my life.

325
00:13:26.624 --> 00:13:28.425
I lived alone, I worked for the government.

326
00:13:28.425 --> 00:13:30.560
My life was my work.

327
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.565
I had had an accident at work that had injured me.

328
00:13:34.565 --> 00:13:36.300
I actually had a back injury so that my work

329
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.836
was increasingly difficult for me.

330
00:13:38.836 --> 00:13:41.505
All of that changed after I met Dr. Wambach.

331
00:13:41.505 --> 00:13:44.208
One of the things that happened with that

332
00:13:44.208 --> 00:13:47.644
was that I went to a conference where there were

333
00:13:47.644 --> 00:13:50.814
healers, and a healer actually came up to me and said,

334
00:13:50.814 --> 00:13:53.350
you've been carrying that back problem for several years.

335
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:54.919
Wow, that was true.

336
00:13:54.919 --> 00:13:57.189
And do you want it to change?

337
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:59.122
And you know, I said yes right away.

338
00:13:59.122 --> 00:13:59.958
I was young and brash.

339
00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:00.991
He said okay.

340
00:14:00.991 --> 00:14:02.425
He put his hand up my back and it was like

341
00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:04.160
a red-hot poker.

342
00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.763
My back straightened out and I've never

343
00:14:05.763 --> 00:14:08.537
had any back problems except when I get overworked.

344
00:14:08.537 --> 00:14:09.833
<v Regina>Stressed, yeah.</v>

345
00:14:09.833 --> 00:14:11.668
<v ->Yeah, over-stressed, then my back starts,</v>

346
00:14:11.668 --> 00:14:13.137
and that's my warning.

347
00:14:13.137 --> 00:14:15.840
So, with Helen when she passed away,

348
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.574
in fact, just before she passed away I realized that

349
00:14:17.574 --> 00:14:19.778
this was the end of that relationship.

350
00:14:19.778 --> 00:14:24.014
I decided to leave my government job and go to France

351
00:14:24.014 --> 00:14:26.217
where, as I say I have family roots,

352
00:14:26.217 --> 00:14:29.520
and see what would happen if I were to use

353
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.722
the same techniques on a French-speaking population

354
00:14:32.722 --> 00:14:34.658
that would be very different culturally

355
00:14:34.658 --> 00:14:38.996
than my American friends and the American people I knew.

356
00:14:38.996 --> 00:14:41.766
So I set myself up in Paris, I had some contacts.

357
00:14:41.766 --> 00:14:43.300
I rented an apartment.

358
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:47.871
And what I found was that in France, at that time,

359
00:14:47.871 --> 00:14:51.041
remember this is 20 years ago or more than 20 now.

360
00:14:51.041 --> 00:14:54.746
There were only two types of people that were above ground

361
00:14:54.746 --> 00:14:56.514
in what we would call new age.

362
00:14:56.514 --> 00:15:00.517
One were astrologers and the others were yoga schools.

363
00:15:00.517 --> 00:15:01.718
It's very interesting.

364
00:15:01.718 --> 00:15:04.654
So I found that yoga teachers had schools.

365
00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:07.026
Astrologers used to have classes.

366
00:15:07.026 --> 00:15:09.296
So I quickly found that if I wanted to do groups

367
00:15:09.296 --> 00:15:11.296
I needed to get in touch with yoga schools.

368
00:15:11.296 --> 00:15:14.666
So I began doing the yoga school circuit in Paris.

369
00:15:14.666 --> 00:15:17.301
And within a month or two I had some contacts

370
00:15:17.301 --> 00:15:20.938
and I started renting out their studios one night a week

371
00:15:20.938 --> 00:15:22.439
because most of the classes that they did

372
00:15:22.439 --> 00:15:24.642
were in the day time, so the evenings were free.

373
00:15:24.642 --> 00:15:26.513
And I could advertise through them.

374
00:15:26.513 --> 00:15:28.379
A lot of people interested in yoga,

375
00:15:28.379 --> 00:15:30.882
the concept of reincarnation or regression

376
00:15:30.882 --> 00:15:34.151
wasn't outside of their mindset.

377
00:15:34.151 --> 00:15:38.088
I introduced slowly progression into the work.

378
00:15:38.088 --> 00:15:40.025
Doing essentially what Helen had done.

379
00:15:40.025 --> 00:15:42.427
Which was taking two or three past periods

380
00:15:42.427 --> 00:15:44.829
and then two or three future periods.

381
00:15:44.829 --> 00:15:47.697
So I could also compare that way with what she

382
00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:49.372
had done in the United States.

383
00:15:49.372 --> 00:15:51.636
I worked that way for about two years,

384
00:15:51.636 --> 00:15:54.040
and it was during that time in fact, that I met my wife

385
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.143
who was a yoga instructor in the south of France,

386
00:15:57.143 --> 00:16:00.211
and who came to me in a group session in Paris

387
00:16:00.211 --> 00:16:02.146
with her sister-in-law.

388
00:16:02.146 --> 00:16:05.248
And like I say,

389
00:16:05.248 --> 00:16:06.516
<v Regina>And the rest is history.</v>

390
00:16:06.516 --> 00:16:07.151
<v ->Well it is a little bit.</v>

391
00:16:07.151 --> 00:16:08.320
<v Regina>She's sitting right here behind me.</v>

392
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.419
<v ->That's right, exactly.</v>

393
00:16:09.419 --> 00:16:11.556
She's right here in Sedona, Arizona.

394
00:16:11.556 --> 00:16:12.857
I suppose you could say I did my own

395
00:16:12.857 --> 00:16:14.591
cross-cultural research.

396
00:16:14.591 --> 00:16:15.793
<v Regina>Yes, you did.</v>

397
00:16:15.793 --> 00:16:18.095
Okay, so I'm going to go back to that.

398
00:16:18.095 --> 00:16:21.565
So, what did you find cross-culturally?

399
00:16:21.565 --> 00:16:25.435
What were some of the mass psyche developments

400
00:16:25.435 --> 00:16:27.271
that were occurring in the future?

401
00:16:27.271 --> 00:16:29.139
<v ->Right, and what happened was this.</v>

402
00:16:29.139 --> 00:16:34.139
We took these two time periods, one is between 21 and 2200,

403
00:16:34.178 --> 00:16:37.080
so about 150 years from now for the average.

404
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.882
And the other was 200 years beyond that

405
00:16:38.882 --> 00:16:42.753
in the 23 to 2450 time period.

406
00:16:42.753 --> 00:16:45.091
When we took people and took the reports

407
00:16:45.091 --> 00:16:47.060
of people who went to those periods,

408
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.597
I was amazed that the French reports

409
00:16:49.597 --> 00:16:53.134
didn't vary very much from the American reports

410
00:16:53.134 --> 00:16:55.465
and even from British reports that another colleague

411
00:16:55.465 --> 00:16:57.034
went and did in England.

412
00:16:57.034 --> 00:16:59.505
And ultimately, I also did them in Argentina.

413
00:16:59.505 --> 00:17:01.671
So I did them in Spanish, I happen to speak Spanish

414
00:17:01.671 --> 00:17:03.474
as well as French and English.

415
00:17:03.474 --> 00:17:05.543
If you speak one of those Romance languages,

416
00:17:05.543 --> 00:17:07.344
the other ones come up pretty quickly for you.

417
00:17:07.344 --> 00:17:09.580
We had essentially three different

418
00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:12.849
language groups with data.

419
00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:16.887
And what I found was that if you took the key question

420
00:17:16.887 --> 00:17:18.655
of what environment do you find yourself in?

421
00:17:18.655 --> 00:17:19.992
What kind of a place?

422
00:17:19.992 --> 00:17:22.626
Helen always kept very simple, so we'll say

423
00:17:22.626 --> 00:17:25.262
she'd say now look around you.

424
00:17:25.262 --> 00:17:27.531
Are you outside, what is it like?

425
00:17:27.531 --> 00:17:29.100
Is there a breeze?

426
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.968
Is it hot, is it cold, dry?

427
00:17:30.968 --> 00:17:32.671
These are questions that people can get

428
00:17:32.671 --> 00:17:34.638
in the subconscious mind pretty easily.

429
00:17:34.638 --> 00:17:37.474
And what amazed me was that regardless

430
00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:41.178
of the cultural group, whether it was from the midwest,

431
00:17:41.178 --> 00:17:44.848
whether it was from England, France, Argentina,

432
00:17:44.848 --> 00:17:47.151
even the settings might be different

433
00:17:47.151 --> 00:17:49.921
the environments remained approximately the same

434
00:17:49.921 --> 00:17:52.089
in these future time periods.

435
00:17:52.089 --> 00:17:54.625
And we found four environments that came up

436
00:17:54.625 --> 00:17:55.725
time and time and time again.

437
00:17:55.725 --> 00:17:56.661
<v Regina>What were they?</v>

438
00:17:56.661 --> 00:17:59.062
<v ->The four were, and they're all outlined in my book,</v>

439
00:17:59.062 --> 00:18:00.730
of course, so people can get my book.

440
00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:02.400
<v Regina>They can, we'll just touch on them.</v>

441
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.267
Just a little teaser here.

442
00:18:03.267 --> 00:18:06.303
<v ->That's fine, the first one I called it Life in Space.</v>

443
00:18:06.303 --> 00:18:08.605
And they were the quarter, maybe a third,

444
00:18:08.605 --> 00:18:10.976
not even that, 20% of the sample

445
00:18:10.976 --> 00:18:14.044
who somehow their lives were off of the earth.

446
00:18:14.044 --> 00:18:15.746
Some of them came back to the earth,

447
00:18:15.746 --> 00:18:17.815
but somehow they were living on a space station

448
00:18:17.815 --> 00:18:21.351
or a platform, or a moon base or something like that.

449
00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:24.392
Then the second group I call them the Creative Communities

450
00:18:24.392 --> 00:18:25.956
and the New Age Communities.

451
00:18:25.956 --> 00:18:28.759
They were in isolated groups and they were the only ones

452
00:18:28.759 --> 00:18:31.264
that I would say had a really beautiful

453
00:18:31.264 --> 00:18:33.231
environment around them.

454
00:18:33.231 --> 00:18:35.638
Later I came to realize that they may have been

455
00:18:35.638 --> 00:18:39.170
practicing some form of mental control

456
00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.637
over their environment.

457
00:18:40.637 --> 00:18:43.507
The telepathy may have advanced in 150 years

458
00:18:43.507 --> 00:18:45.508
to that extent that a group of people could

459
00:18:45.508 --> 00:18:47.945
consciously in a sense, create a bubble

460
00:18:47.945 --> 00:18:51.184
of orchards around you.

461
00:18:51.184 --> 00:18:53.850
And they were all doing creative or spiritual things.

462
00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.386
That was what interested me the most.

463
00:18:55.386 --> 00:18:56.787
And whether they were French,

464
00:18:56.787 --> 00:18:58.779
or Argentinian didn't matter.

465
00:18:58.779 --> 00:19:00.423
They were somehow involved in a spiritual,

466
00:19:00.423 --> 00:19:05.423
creative, learning kind of artistic lifestyle.

467
00:19:05.796 --> 00:19:07.998
Then the third group who are the majority

468
00:19:07.998 --> 00:19:10.034
and they were clearly, I think they were over 50%,

469
00:19:10.034 --> 00:19:12.903
they were the techies or the high-tech.

470
00:19:12.903 --> 00:19:14.071
And that's not surprising.

471
00:19:14.071 --> 00:19:16.109
But they had a very different environment.

472
00:19:16.109 --> 00:19:18.509
They were living in artificial environments,

473
00:19:18.509 --> 00:19:21.444
in domes or even underground.

474
00:19:21.444 --> 00:19:25.049
And when I asked a few in my later subject groups

475
00:19:25.049 --> 00:19:26.950
because I had been looking at some of the data

476
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:27.985
by that time,

477
00:19:27.985 --> 00:19:29.172
I asked them can you go above ground

478
00:19:29.172 --> 00:19:31.959
or can you go outside or can you see outside?

479
00:19:31.959 --> 00:19:33.458
You know, is there a window?

480
00:19:33.458 --> 00:19:36.765
They uniformly told me, well if I do I have to

481
00:19:36.765 --> 00:19:39.096
put on a mask, I have to put on a suit.

482
00:19:39.096 --> 00:19:41.131
Somehow it's toxic.

483
00:19:41.131 --> 00:19:43.268
We're being protected in this technological

484
00:19:43.268 --> 00:19:44.568
environment underground.

485
00:19:44.568 --> 00:19:46.370
And then the final group,

486
00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:48.505
and it may sound completely different

487
00:19:48.505 --> 00:19:50.908
because it kind of spooked me at the beginning.

488
00:19:50.908 --> 00:19:53.176
They were the primitives or the rustics.

489
00:19:53.176 --> 00:19:54.945
And they were living above ground

490
00:19:54.945 --> 00:19:56.646
out in that polluted environment,

491
00:19:56.646 --> 00:19:58.248
but it didn't seem to bother them.

492
00:19:58.248 --> 00:20:02.091
And they were doing ordinary things

493
00:20:02.091 --> 00:20:04.856
that you might expect people of 100 years ago to do.

494
00:20:04.856 --> 00:20:06.992
So instead of going 150 years in the future,

495
00:20:06.992 --> 00:20:09.292
they seemed to be going to the past.

496
00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:12.697
And it was only when I asked them geographical questions,

497
00:20:12.697 --> 00:20:16.066
so where are you, can you see a ball of the Earth?

498
00:20:16.066 --> 00:20:18.135
And where are you located?

499
00:20:18.135 --> 00:20:19.770
That I realized they were telling me places

500
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.507
like Greenland, like Siberia,

501
00:20:22.507 --> 00:20:24.908
like Northern Canada.

502
00:20:24.908 --> 00:20:27.784
And yet the climate was not at all like we think of it.

503
00:20:27.784 --> 00:20:28.945
It was similar to what you might think

504
00:20:28.945 --> 00:20:32.415
of North Carolina or Pennsylvania today.

505
00:20:32.415 --> 00:20:34.852
That got me.

506
00:20:34.852 --> 00:20:36.220
<v Regina>Earth changes.</v>

507
00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:37.654
<v ->Yes, earth changes, and the French</v>

508
00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:38.556
would say the same thing.

509
00:20:38.556 --> 00:20:39.756
They would say we're up in Siberia.

510
00:20:39.756 --> 00:20:41.024
And then I'd ask them what it was like

511
00:20:41.024 --> 00:20:42.625
and they'd give me a French reference.

512
00:20:42.625 --> 00:20:45.863
But it would be similar to a temperate normal

513
00:20:45.863 --> 00:20:48.732
middle of France type climate today

514
00:20:48.732 --> 00:20:52.069
which is approximately like an East Coast type of climate.

515
00:20:52.069 --> 00:20:54.904
<v Regina>So clearly, that was a really big factor</v>

516
00:20:54.904 --> 00:20:56.439
is that something had happened to change

517
00:20:56.439 --> 00:20:58.108
our climatological condition.

518
00:20:58.108 --> 00:21:01.411
<v ->Exactly, and that is what we really honed in on</v>

519
00:21:01.411 --> 00:21:04.315
then on the private sessions that Helen did with me.

520
00:21:04.315 --> 00:21:05.849
And we did it with a couple of other people.

521
00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:07.785
But as I say, there seems to be this failsafe,

522
00:21:07.785 --> 00:21:09.186
you're not going to get a lot of information

523
00:21:09.186 --> 00:21:11.626
about that time period just because most people

524
00:21:11.626 --> 00:21:14.792
it's built into our psyche not to go there.

525
00:21:14.792 --> 00:21:17.394
Or if you do go there suddenly you get too involved

526
00:21:17.394 --> 00:21:20.397
in your dreams, or your fears, or your emotions.

527
00:21:20.397 --> 00:21:22.032
<v Regina>I think that's a really key part</v>

528
00:21:22.032 --> 00:21:24.434
that people don't really talk about.

529
00:21:24.434 --> 00:21:25.168
<v ->Yes.</v>

530
00:21:25.168 --> 00:21:26.270
<v Regina>When you start future pacing things</v>

531
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:28.705
you start taking yourself into another place completely.

532
00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:29.939
<v ->Exactly.</v>

533
00:21:29.939 --> 00:21:31.508
<v Regina>That's very interesting you were seeing it</v>

534
00:21:31.508 --> 00:21:33.577
though in group and privately.

535
00:21:33.577 --> 00:21:34.946
<v ->Yes, both sessions.</v>

536
00:21:34.946 --> 00:21:37.280
So what we learned to do was essentially

537
00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.951
skip over that period and see what the results are.

538
00:21:40.951 --> 00:21:43.286
And then the subconscious mind has no problem.

539
00:21:43.286 --> 00:21:44.956
First of all, it's a whole different body,

540
00:21:44.956 --> 00:21:46.525
whole different life.

541
00:21:46.525 --> 00:21:48.358
Many women were men, many men were women,

542
00:21:48.358 --> 00:21:49.128
et cetera.

543
00:21:49.128 --> 00:21:51.062
It doesn't seem to matter that much.

544
00:21:51.062 --> 00:21:53.363
One thing that came up strongly

545
00:21:53.363 --> 00:21:55.900
that Helen was fascinated with and in her past life,

546
00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.068
and we actually found it true in the future as well,

547
00:21:58.068 --> 00:22:00.005
and I know it discussed it in the book is

548
00:22:00.005 --> 00:22:02.841
even though two-thirds or more of my subjects were women,

549
00:22:02.841 --> 00:22:04.808
because women have been kind of traditionally

550
00:22:04.808 --> 00:22:08.011
more open to exploring their inner psychic world,

551
00:22:08.011 --> 00:22:12.015
the births in the future subjects came up

552
00:22:12.015 --> 00:22:15.085
to exactly 51 to 49 percent.

553
00:22:15.085 --> 00:22:18.556
Which is precisely what the birth ratio needs to be

554
00:22:18.556 --> 00:22:20.257
because male babies die a little more

555
00:22:20.257 --> 00:22:21.692
than female babies for the population

556
00:22:21.692 --> 00:22:24.394
to remain men and women.

557
00:22:24.394 --> 00:22:27.397
So, a lot of women saw themselves as men

558
00:22:27.397 --> 00:22:28.465
in these future lives.

559
00:22:28.465 --> 00:22:30.801
And I don't know if this was psychically determined

560
00:22:30.801 --> 00:22:32.769
ahead of time or why.

561
00:22:32.769 --> 00:22:34.271
I can't give you an explanation.

562
00:22:34.271 --> 00:22:35.672
All I can tell you is they're the facts.

563
00:22:35.672 --> 00:22:38.442
Two-thirds of my subjects were women.

564
00:22:38.442 --> 00:22:42.412
50% or 51% saw themselves as men,

565
00:22:42.412 --> 00:22:44.548
49% saw themselves as women.

566
00:22:44.548 --> 00:22:47.284
Of all the subjects, men and women taken together.

567
00:22:47.284 --> 00:22:50.020
And that's one of those statistical goodies

568
00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.257
that thrills the statistician and sociologist

569
00:22:53.257 --> 00:22:55.126
and probably bores everybody else.

570
00:22:55.126 --> 00:22:56.527
<v Regina>Right, but know that it's significant.</v>

571
00:22:56.527 --> 00:22:57.928
<v ->But it's significant, right.</v>

572
00:22:57.928 --> 00:22:59.462
Right, that's what I'm trying to get at.

573
00:22:59.462 --> 00:23:02.768
<v Regina>Okay, so we could talk for days.</v>

574
00:23:02.768 --> 00:23:04.735
So because we can't talk for days I'm going

575
00:23:04.735 --> 00:23:06.270
to hopscotch you forward a little bit,

576
00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.139
or in the whole mix here.

577
00:23:08.139 --> 00:23:09.642
So now you're looking at those stats.

578
00:23:09.642 --> 00:23:11.274
You've kind of future paced yourself a bit.

579
00:23:11.274 --> 00:23:14.967
Now comes the connection with the Hopi

580
00:23:14.967 --> 00:23:17.313
where we start getting into imagery which leads us

581
00:23:17.313 --> 00:23:18.416
to the crop circles.

582
00:23:18.416 --> 00:23:21.051
And you were part of the Edgar Cayce Foundation

583
00:23:21.051 --> 00:23:22.453
Research Group at one time, too.

584
00:23:22.453 --> 00:23:24.387
You had a study group, you were part of that, right?

585
00:23:24.387 --> 00:23:26.027
<v ->Yes, I was, yes for many years.</v>

586
00:23:26.027 --> 00:23:28.124
<v Regina>We know a lot of his predictions</v>

587
00:23:28.124 --> 00:23:29.627
for this period of time.

588
00:23:29.627 --> 00:23:33.104
Just take the story and kind of run through it

589
00:23:33.104 --> 00:23:35.199
in a linear way if you would, please.

590
00:23:35.199 --> 00:23:38.602
<v ->Okay, so basically I wrote my book in France.</v>

591
00:23:38.602 --> 00:23:42.281
I was living in France from 1985 until 1989.

592
00:23:42.281 --> 00:23:46.343
And it was about 1987 that McGraw-Hill got interested.

593
00:23:46.343 --> 00:23:49.680
I think it has to do with a book called Out on a Limb.

594
00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.514
<v Regina>I remember that.</v>

595
00:23:50.514 --> 00:23:52.816
<v ->It appeared at that time, and suddenly it made</v>

596
00:23:52.816 --> 00:23:56.056
things like progression and regression

597
00:23:56.056 --> 00:24:01.056
spiritual awakenings acceptable to the mainstream

598
00:24:01.492 --> 00:24:05.163
in the publishers' eyes.

599
00:24:05.163 --> 00:24:08.031
When my book was in its final form

600
00:24:08.031 --> 00:24:09.933
and the editor and I had agreed that this

601
00:24:09.933 --> 00:24:12.770
was how it was going to be, I realized that I needed

602
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:15.606
to move back to the United States if I was going

603
00:24:15.606 --> 00:24:17.107
to have any success with it.

604
00:24:17.107 --> 00:24:19.679
Anything media-wise would be in the United States

605
00:24:19.679 --> 00:24:21.010
and I would have to be here.

606
00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:26.010
So I chose to close up my work in France,

607
00:24:26.083 --> 00:24:30.154
and I was just renting anyway, and move back in fact,

608
00:24:30.154 --> 00:24:33.423
to Southern California at first.

609
00:24:33.423 --> 00:24:36.526
I lived at Lake Arrowhead and I worked with a woman

610
00:24:36.526 --> 00:24:38.862
named Dr. Winifred Lucas who was a well-known

611
00:24:38.862 --> 00:24:43.166
regression therapist, psychological mentor of mine

612
00:24:43.166 --> 00:24:44.807
as well as Dr. Wambach.

613
00:24:44.807 --> 00:24:47.271
And the Association for Past Life Research and Therapies

614
00:24:47.271 --> 00:24:48.572
which is down there.

615
00:24:48.572 --> 00:24:50.045
And I was a part of their board of directors.

616
00:24:50.045 --> 00:24:52.208
So I was down there for a couple of years.

617
00:24:52.208 --> 00:24:56.147
And during that time, when the book was getting itself

618
00:24:56.147 --> 00:25:01.147
together, I came to Arizona for the first time.

619
00:25:01.655 --> 00:25:03.254
And I'd never been to Arizona.

620
00:25:03.254 --> 00:25:04.855
I had seen these progression experiences

621
00:25:04.855 --> 00:25:05.822
of me in Arizona.

622
00:25:05.822 --> 00:25:09.325
And frankly, it kept me away.

623
00:25:09.325 --> 00:25:10.961
<v Regina>I'm not ready for the desert.</v>

624
00:25:10.961 --> 00:25:12.543
<v ->I'm not ready for this, I don't want to move there.</v>

625
00:25:12.543 --> 00:25:13.831
I don't really want to be there, you know.

626
00:25:13.831 --> 00:25:15.765
I'm a Cancer, I love the ocean.

627
00:25:15.765 --> 00:25:17.634
And yet all of the things we were seeing

628
00:25:17.634 --> 00:25:19.670
in these progressions was that being by the ocean

629
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:21.705
might not be the best place to be if the earth

630
00:25:21.705 --> 00:25:23.273
starts rocking and rolling.

631
00:25:23.273 --> 00:25:26.810
Water is one of those things that sloshes around

632
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:28.712
a good deal.

633
00:25:28.712 --> 00:25:32.249
At this period I decided to come and visit Arizona.

634
00:25:32.249 --> 00:25:33.784
I had a friend who lived in Arizona.

635
00:25:33.784 --> 00:25:38.784
And she wanted to set up a clinic and use the past

636
00:25:39.289 --> 00:25:43.327
and future, and past life regression therapy concepts

637
00:25:43.327 --> 00:25:44.261
here at Arizona.

638
00:25:44.261 --> 00:25:46.896
Actually working, possibly with the A.R.E. Clinic,

639
00:25:46.896 --> 00:25:48.432
which is in Phoenix.

640
00:25:48.432 --> 00:25:51.471
The first thing that I'll never forget,

641
00:25:51.471 --> 00:25:52.805
I drove north of Phoenix and I thought

642
00:25:52.805 --> 00:25:55.608
oh, my God, this is the landscape that I saw.

643
00:25:55.608 --> 00:25:56.840
<v Regina>In your progression.</v>

644
00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.874
<v ->In the progression experience.</v>

645
00:25:57.874 --> 00:25:58.841
<v Regina>Years, many years before.</v>

646
00:25:58.841 --> 00:26:00.911
<v ->Oh, seven or eight years before this.</v>

647
00:26:00.911 --> 00:26:03.113
So in '82, '83 time period.

648
00:26:03.113 --> 00:26:05.616
So here we are in '89 or 1990.

649
00:26:05.616 --> 00:26:10.086
And this is just too priceless.

650
00:26:10.086 --> 00:26:12.655
These things happen and you couldn't write them

651
00:26:12.655 --> 00:26:14.028
into a script.

652
00:26:14.028 --> 00:26:16.893
I got off the freeway to get something at one of these

653
00:26:16.893 --> 00:26:20.831
not a maybe Cordes Junction, one of those kind of places.

654
00:26:20.831 --> 00:26:25.136
There is a big sign, Vision Properties for sale.

655
00:26:25.136 --> 00:26:28.005
<v Regina>(laughing) Visions Properties for sale.</v>

656
00:26:28.005 --> 00:26:32.075
<v ->And it was exactly the scene I had seen.</v>

657
00:26:32.075 --> 00:26:33.443
<v Regina>There's your sign.</v>

658
00:26:33.443 --> 00:26:34.912
<v ->Went on a little further and I went to Sedona,</v>

659
00:26:34.912 --> 00:26:36.813
and I fell in love with Sedona.

660
00:26:36.813 --> 00:26:39.349
And I said wow, I love Sedona, this is a prettier place

661
00:26:39.349 --> 00:26:40.655
than I had seen.

662
00:26:40.655 --> 00:26:42.453
And I said, you know I think if I'm going to move

663
00:26:42.453 --> 00:26:44.392
to Arizona, if I'm going to get involved in Arizona,

664
00:26:44.392 --> 00:26:46.289
if I don't go to Phoenix I'm coming to Sedona.

665
00:26:46.289 --> 00:26:49.192
So as it were, I ended up moving to Scottsdale

666
00:26:49.192 --> 00:26:52.128
because the clinic was going to open

667
00:26:52.128 --> 00:26:53.663
and we were going to do all this.

668
00:26:53.663 --> 00:26:54.965
It all fell apart, by the way.

669
00:26:54.965 --> 00:26:56.967
It was just to get me there, I realize that.

670
00:26:56.967 --> 00:26:59.737
But within a week of getting in my apartment

671
00:26:59.737 --> 00:27:03.273
in Scottsdale I got a phone call really early in the morning

672
00:27:03.273 --> 00:27:05.343
and it was a man from the Hopi reservation.

673
00:27:05.343 --> 00:27:07.677
And one of their people had gotten my book

674
00:27:07.677 --> 00:27:11.097
which was now out in print and had read

675
00:27:11.097 --> 00:27:13.050
that I talked about their prophesies.

676
00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.953
One of their elders had decided that I might

677
00:27:15.953 --> 00:27:19.757
have a piece of a puzzle that they were looking for,

678
00:27:19.757 --> 00:27:22.261
and particularly someone with European connections

679
00:27:22.261 --> 00:27:24.528
from the east, as they say.

680
00:27:24.528 --> 00:27:27.064
And they invited me to come up there.

681
00:27:27.064 --> 00:27:29.300
They didn't just say next week why don't you come up.

682
00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.468
It was like, oh at four o'clock

683
00:27:30.468 --> 00:27:32.135
this afternoon we're meeting.

684
00:27:32.135 --> 00:27:33.403
This is seven in the morning.

685
00:27:33.403 --> 00:27:35.172
And there's just about enough time to drive

686
00:27:35.172 --> 00:27:38.275
from Phoenix to the Hopi Reservation to get there.

687
00:27:38.275 --> 00:27:40.510
So I called a buddy and I said listen,

688
00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:43.713
I don't have a pick-up truck or that kind of gear

689
00:27:43.713 --> 00:27:45.215
but you do.

690
00:27:45.215 --> 00:27:47.184
Can we drive up together, wouldn't you like an adventure?

691
00:27:47.184 --> 00:27:48.618
And he's an adventurous kind of person.

692
00:27:48.618 --> 00:27:49.786
So he said yes.

693
00:27:49.786 --> 00:27:51.888
And we drove up and we spent two days up there

694
00:27:51.888 --> 00:27:54.125
talking with them.

695
00:27:54.125 --> 00:27:56.493
And on the very last thought, the very last minute

696
00:27:56.493 --> 00:27:58.662
I had just gotten some information from England

697
00:27:58.662 --> 00:28:01.331
that somebody had sent me a book on crop circles

698
00:28:01.331 --> 00:28:03.070
in which there were some diagrams.

699
00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:07.370
And this was, remember was in February of 1991,

700
00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:08.804
yes, it has to be 1991.

701
00:28:08.804 --> 00:28:09.740
<v Regina>I think that's what it said.</v>

702
00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:10.973
<v ->Yeah, February of '91.</v>

703
00:28:10.973 --> 00:28:12.041
I'm trying to think of exactly,

704
00:28:12.041 --> 00:28:15.378
everybody's dates get a little hazy after a while.

705
00:28:15.378 --> 00:28:19.151
So I took these photocopies that I had made

706
00:28:19.151 --> 00:28:21.252
of some of these diagrams because they reminded me

707
00:28:21.252 --> 00:28:22.586
of rock art.

708
00:28:22.586 --> 00:28:25.122
You know, the Southwest American, and I'd never seen it

709
00:28:25.122 --> 00:28:26.223
except in books.

710
00:28:26.223 --> 00:28:27.857
But I said okay, this will be kind of neat.

711
00:28:27.857 --> 00:28:30.126
I'll show it and ask do they know what these mean

712
00:28:30.126 --> 00:28:31.828
because the big question at that point was

713
00:28:31.828 --> 00:28:35.231
as it still is today 15 years later, what do they mean?

714
00:28:35.231 --> 00:28:36.800
And what do they say?

715
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.401
<v Regina>The crop circles.</v>

716
00:28:37.401 --> 00:28:38.202
<v ->The crop circles, what are they saying?</v>

717
00:28:38.202 --> 00:28:40.470
What do these pictures, in a sense,

718
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:43.640
in wheat fields of symbols, diagrams,

719
00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:44.508
what do they mean?

720
00:28:44.508 --> 00:28:47.577
So I took this up and in a way the rest is history,

721
00:28:47.577 --> 00:28:49.079
because I just happened to pull it out.

722
00:28:49.079 --> 00:28:52.449
I showed it to the people that we were gathered for dinner.

723
00:28:52.449 --> 00:28:55.986
And the change in these elders faces

724
00:28:55.986 --> 00:28:58.354
was something I wish you could have on film.

725
00:28:58.354 --> 00:29:01.757
Because they went from being rather reserved,

726
00:29:01.757 --> 00:29:05.596
dignified, elderly men who talked a little bit

727
00:29:05.596 --> 00:29:07.664
and listened to an answer, and talked a little bit

728
00:29:07.664 --> 00:29:09.766
into kids.

729
00:29:09.766 --> 00:29:11.635
They suddenly were 10 to 12 years old.

730
00:29:11.635 --> 00:29:13.470
They were jabbering back and forth

731
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:15.839
in their own language, too fast for the translator.

732
00:29:15.839 --> 00:29:17.144
They took the papers out of my hands.

733
00:29:17.144 --> 00:29:20.110
They drew on the papers, they corrected as they told me,

734
00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:21.778
the crop circles.

735
00:29:21.778 --> 00:29:24.147
They added things, they turned them upside down,

736
00:29:24.147 --> 00:29:25.181
yes, yes.

737
00:29:25.181 --> 00:29:26.483
They said they shouldn't be that way,

738
00:29:26.483 --> 00:29:27.517
it should be this way.

739
00:29:27.517 --> 00:29:29.656
And in other words, they related to them.

740
00:29:29.656 --> 00:29:31.222
And that's what I immediately understood,

741
00:29:31.222 --> 00:29:36.222
that they had a visceral relationship to these symbols

742
00:29:36.361 --> 00:29:41.361
that I, as an American French westerner hadn't a clue.

743
00:29:43.602 --> 00:29:47.637
I realized that these people don't get excited

744
00:29:47.637 --> 00:29:48.539
about just anything.

745
00:29:48.539 --> 00:29:51.751
I had been spent the day with them by that time.

746
00:29:51.751 --> 00:29:55.112
What they're telling us is very serious.

747
00:29:55.112 --> 00:29:57.848
What I've seen in these progressions dovetails

748
00:29:57.848 --> 00:30:00.684
in a lot with what they're saying about Mother Earth

749
00:30:00.684 --> 00:30:03.820
being overburdened and out of balance.

750
00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.856
And that our industrial complex society has,

751
00:30:06.856 --> 00:30:10.961
we're stripping too many resources too quickly

752
00:30:10.961 --> 00:30:12.663
for them to resource.

753
00:30:12.663 --> 00:30:15.538
So the earth is going to in a sense, rise up herself

754
00:30:15.538 --> 00:30:18.935
and take care of this problem.

755
00:30:18.935 --> 00:30:20.203
<v Regina>All these many years later we're starting</v>

756
00:30:20.203 --> 00:30:21.337
to see a lot of anomalies.

757
00:30:21.337 --> 00:30:22.540
<v ->And it's happening.</v>

758
00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:26.309
So these symbols said something to them about that.

759
00:30:26.309 --> 00:30:29.813
I had to say to myself, even after,

760
00:30:29.813 --> 00:30:34.284
oh, and then the icing on the cake was the next morning,

761
00:30:34.284 --> 00:30:35.985
they don't ever tell you what they're going to do.

762
00:30:35.985 --> 00:30:37.391
I don't know if you've worked with Native Elders.

763
00:30:37.391 --> 00:30:38.588
They're very wonderful.

764
00:30:38.588 --> 00:30:40.824
They size you up, they read you.

765
00:30:40.824 --> 00:30:42.692
They decide, and then they talk about it.

766
00:30:42.692 --> 00:30:44.394
And then they come back and tell you the next day

767
00:30:44.394 --> 00:30:45.130
what's going to happen.

768
00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:47.397
We had no program, we were just there.

769
00:30:47.397 --> 00:30:52.102
They suddenly said you know, we want to show you

770
00:30:52.102 --> 00:30:54.103
some of the origins of what we were

771
00:30:54.103 --> 00:30:55.104
talking about last night.

772
00:30:55.104 --> 00:30:58.107
So they took us out in their own trucks

773
00:30:58.107 --> 00:31:00.944
and went out in the middle of their reservation somewhere

774
00:31:00.944 --> 00:31:03.413
to this little canyon which is secret.

775
00:31:03.413 --> 00:31:07.183
I have no idea where we went, to be truthful with you.

776
00:31:07.183 --> 00:31:09.018
It was on dirt roads and tracks.

777
00:31:09.018 --> 00:31:12.288
And there were amazing rock petroglyphs

778
00:31:12.288 --> 00:31:14.056
like I'd never seen.

779
00:31:14.056 --> 00:31:15.591
Up about eight foot high,

780
00:31:15.591 --> 00:31:19.462
so a man sitting on a man's shoulders could do this easily.

781
00:31:19.462 --> 00:31:23.433
Maybe 500 yards of these

782
00:31:23.433 --> 00:31:24.767
down this canyon.

783
00:31:24.767 --> 00:31:27.570
And at the end of it in a kind of most sacred place

784
00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:30.292
the rock was blackened for some natural reason.

785
00:31:30.292 --> 00:31:32.342
Normally it was sort of reddish sandstone.

786
00:31:32.342 --> 00:31:33.344
And it was blackened.

787
00:31:33.344 --> 00:31:37.056
And there they had carved out and made an ochre carving

788
00:31:37.056 --> 00:31:38.787
of some of the crop circles.

789
00:31:38.787 --> 00:31:41.240
And they were almost identical to the crop circles

790
00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.585
I'd been showing them.

791
00:31:42.585 --> 00:31:44.220
And some of them in fact, were upside down

792
00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.390
in the book, and here they were right side up.

793
00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:48.502
They interpreted some of them for me.

794
00:31:48.502 --> 00:31:51.630
And what they said was these are telling us

795
00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:55.065
from the very distant past, going back thousands of years,

796
00:31:55.065 --> 00:31:56.801
and this is our tradition,

797
00:31:56.801 --> 00:31:58.871
that these signs are going to come,

798
00:31:58.871 --> 00:32:01.604
and then the purification as they call it,

799
00:32:01.604 --> 00:32:04.006
or the earth changes are going to take place.

800
00:32:04.006 --> 00:32:06.443
And you have brought a piece of the puzzle

801
00:32:06.443 --> 00:32:09.885
with these diagrams from Europe where it's supposed

802
00:32:09.885 --> 00:32:13.656
to happen first, to us.

803
00:32:13.656 --> 00:32:15.501
That's what they said.

804
00:32:15.501 --> 00:32:17.156
<v Regina>How has this progressed?</v>

805
00:32:17.156 --> 00:32:20.223
If you take again, now looking at the big, big picture

806
00:32:20.223 --> 00:32:20.891
you're taking what they saw,

807
00:32:20.891 --> 00:32:24.233
you're taking what the crop circles are indicating

808
00:32:24.233 --> 00:32:26.558
and their interpretation, other interpretations.

809
00:32:26.558 --> 00:32:30.066
The news we can use for us today,

810
00:32:30.066 --> 00:32:32.202
what are you seeing that is coming through?

811
00:32:32.202 --> 00:32:34.610
<v ->Well, a couple of things.</v>

812
00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:38.108
First, yes, it is a big picture and it's been broken up

813
00:32:38.108 --> 00:32:40.076
like a puzzle perhaps quite deliberately.

814
00:32:40.076 --> 00:32:42.813
And I don't believe any one person or group of people

815
00:32:42.813 --> 00:32:46.816
have all of the answers, all of the pieces of the puzzle.

816
00:32:46.816 --> 00:32:47.751
<v Regina>Right, I agree.</v>

817
00:32:47.751 --> 00:32:50.052
<v ->And one of the reasons, thinking about it,</v>

818
00:32:50.052 --> 00:32:54.530
is that this forces people into some sort of cooperation.

819
00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:57.695
Because I believe the crop circles,

820
00:32:57.695 --> 00:33:00.044
and it's been 16, 17 years now

821
00:33:00.044 --> 00:33:01.442
since I've been studying them,

822
00:33:01.442 --> 00:33:03.975
you know that my wife and I go to England every summer.

823
00:33:03.975 --> 00:33:07.470
We really devote a significant portion of our time

824
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:08.548
to this research.

825
00:33:08.548 --> 00:33:13.285
And doing annual reports on it, and doing lectures on it,

826
00:33:13.285 --> 00:33:15.450
and conferences on it, and all of these kinds of things

827
00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:17.789
so people can get this information.

828
00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:21.568
What I have seen more than anything else

829
00:33:21.568 --> 00:33:25.077
over this whole time period is that we are being given

830
00:33:25.077 --> 00:33:30.077
a very, very long term course by very patient teachers

831
00:33:31.082 --> 00:33:35.932
who want us to start from many different aspects

832
00:33:35.932 --> 00:33:36.567
of our lives.

833
00:33:36.567 --> 00:33:39.135
And many different people are called into this.

834
00:33:39.135 --> 00:33:42.075
That's why some diagrams and crop circles relate

835
00:33:42.075 --> 00:33:43.573
to sacred geometry.

836
00:33:43.573 --> 00:33:46.109
Some of them relate to mathematical formulas.

837
00:33:46.109 --> 00:33:48.978
Some of them relate to astrophysics, oddly enough.

838
00:33:48.978 --> 00:33:50.580
Some of them relate to chemistry.

839
00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:51.303
<v Regina>DNA.</v>

840
00:33:51.303 --> 00:33:52.727
<v ->Yeah, the DNA.</v>

841
00:33:52.727 --> 00:33:56.026
Some of them relate to ancient spiritual symbols.

842
00:33:56.026 --> 00:33:57.557
Some of them relate to Native cultures

843
00:33:57.557 --> 00:33:58.722
all around the planet.

844
00:33:58.722 --> 00:34:00.996
And some people from those cultures see certain ones

845
00:34:00.996 --> 00:34:02.226
and not other ones.

846
00:34:02.226 --> 00:34:05.411
So there's a huge storehouse that's being brought

847
00:34:05.411 --> 00:34:10.378
in very tight symbological kind of information to us

848
00:34:10.378 --> 00:34:13.806
in shorthand designed, in my opinion,

849
00:34:13.806 --> 00:34:17.425
to bring together curious people

850
00:34:17.425 --> 00:34:19.943
from lots of different places

851
00:34:19.943 --> 00:34:22.912
into connection with each other.

852
00:34:22.912 --> 00:34:24.380
And this is what I believe the crop circle phenomenon

853
00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:26.525
actually has done.

854
00:34:26.525 --> 00:34:27.950
And if I have some small part...

855
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:29.153
<v Regina>Yes, it would appear so.</v>

856
00:34:29.153 --> 00:34:31.228
<v ->In that, I would say that I have succeeded</v>

857
00:34:31.228 --> 00:34:33.164
in what I wanted to do because I think what

858
00:34:33.164 --> 00:34:37.601
they're telling us is their warning,

859
00:34:37.601 --> 00:34:38.828
just like the Hopi have said.

860
00:34:38.828 --> 00:34:41.931
We have not walked softly on the back of our Earth Mother.

861
00:34:41.931 --> 00:34:44.777
We have gotten out of touch with what is nature,

862
00:34:44.777 --> 00:34:47.178
what are the natural ways of the world,

863
00:34:47.178 --> 00:34:49.506
even our own nature, even our human nature.

864
00:34:49.506 --> 00:34:52.318
We now live in virtual reality almost as much as

865
00:34:52.318 --> 00:34:54.505
in 3D reality.

866
00:34:54.505 --> 00:34:57.246
We live in electric boxes.

867
00:34:57.246 --> 00:35:00.517
We drive mechanical electric boxes.

868
00:35:00.517 --> 00:35:03.854
It's real hard for us in a place like Arizona

869
00:35:03.854 --> 00:35:05.789
to get outside without air conditioning,

870
00:35:05.789 --> 00:35:07.673
except Sedona's wonderful for that because we do

871
00:35:07.673 --> 00:35:10.367
have a nice climate here.

872
00:35:10.367 --> 00:35:15.367
The crop circles are putting into a very condensed form

873
00:35:16.198 --> 00:35:20.137
teaching that has been given to us in many different ways

874
00:35:20.137 --> 00:35:23.042
around the planet from history, from science,

875
00:35:23.042 --> 00:35:25.674
from symbols, from mathematics.

876
00:35:25.674 --> 00:35:27.711
And it's saying get your act together.

877
00:35:27.711 --> 00:35:29.846
Now is the time, and come together,

878
00:35:29.846 --> 00:35:31.046
meet each other,

879
00:35:31.046 --> 00:35:33.750
find that you can talk to a mathematician about this,

880
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:35.852
you have things in common

881
00:35:35.852 --> 00:35:38.423
which I never would have believed, particularly.

882
00:35:38.423 --> 00:35:41.567
You can find somebody who's interested

883
00:35:41.567 --> 00:35:44.827
in astrophysics and maybe that's their great passion

884
00:35:44.827 --> 00:35:47.063
while yours is in symbols.

885
00:35:47.063 --> 00:35:50.066
But they work in symbols, too and you can learn from them

886
00:35:50.066 --> 00:35:51.233
and they from you.

887
00:35:51.233 --> 00:35:54.203
And if you can put your ego out of the picture a little bit,

888
00:35:54.203 --> 00:35:56.138
then maybe there's a chance.

889
00:35:56.138 --> 00:35:57.507
And these teachers, whoever they are

890
00:35:57.507 --> 00:36:00.108
I honestly don't know and I maybe shouldn't even

891
00:36:00.108 --> 00:36:04.952
say they, it might be an it or a we.

892
00:36:04.952 --> 00:36:08.218
The jury is out in my opinion.

893
00:36:08.218 --> 00:36:09.719
I think we need to keep as large

894
00:36:09.719 --> 00:36:12.455
an idea on this as possible.

895
00:36:12.455 --> 00:36:15.858
This intelligence is very patient,

896
00:36:15.858 --> 00:36:18.631
seemingly has our best interest at heart.

897
00:36:18.631 --> 00:36:20.032
And if it doesn't our best interest,

898
00:36:20.032 --> 00:36:21.541
certainly the earth's best interest,

899
00:36:21.541 --> 00:36:25.668
and we are part of the earth when we allow ourselves to be.

900
00:36:25.668 --> 00:36:28.440
We're being given this crash course.

901
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.673
Now, why in England, no one knows.

902
00:36:31.673 --> 00:36:33.142
May be that the industrial revolution

903
00:36:33.142 --> 00:36:35.849
that has started all this mess also started in England.

904
00:36:35.849 --> 00:36:37.547
I've talked about that in previous times.

905
00:36:37.547 --> 00:36:40.016
This is connected to the Mayan calendar, by the way.

906
00:36:40.016 --> 00:36:43.452
Definitely follows the ebbs and flows of the modern,

907
00:36:43.452 --> 00:36:44.620
<v Regina>As the Hopi calendars.</v>

908
00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:46.467
<v ->As the Hopi is related to the Mayan calendar, too.</v>

909
00:36:46.467 --> 00:36:48.558
Well, they took it essentially from the same source,

910
00:36:48.558 --> 00:36:49.625
I believe.

911
00:36:49.625 --> 00:36:51.628
The classical Maya, when they split up some of them

912
00:36:51.628 --> 00:36:53.134
became the ancestors of the Hopi,

913
00:36:53.134 --> 00:36:56.332
or Anasazi as they called them at that time.

914
00:36:56.332 --> 00:36:59.102
The Hopi themselves may not agree with that,

915
00:36:59.102 --> 00:37:02.138
but if you look at it anthropologically it's pretty clear

916
00:37:02.138 --> 00:37:03.940
there's a background.

917
00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:06.709
The Hopi actually also say as they were an open tribe

918
00:37:06.709 --> 00:37:09.144
that they have elements who came in from the Pacific,

919
00:37:09.144 --> 00:37:11.847
related to the Hawaiians and Polynesians.

920
00:37:11.847 --> 00:37:14.016
They actually have elements who came in from the north

921
00:37:14.016 --> 00:37:17.553
that are related to the Athtamascans and the Canadians.

922
00:37:17.553 --> 00:37:19.355
And then elements from the south who were the Mayans.

923
00:37:19.355 --> 00:37:20.757
So they were kind of a joining point.

924
00:37:20.757 --> 00:37:23.893
<v Regina>And elements from the sky, the Kachina.</v>

925
00:37:23.893 --> 00:37:24.861
This is a big part.

926
00:37:24.861 --> 00:37:25.895
<v ->Yes, naturally it is, it is.</v>

927
00:37:25.895 --> 00:37:28.297
And the crop circles have that element, too.

928
00:37:28.297 --> 00:37:30.474
After all, the way crop circles are formed

929
00:37:30.474 --> 00:37:33.469
is very likely something in the sky

930
00:37:33.469 --> 00:37:35.672
and not too far up in the sky,

931
00:37:35.672 --> 00:37:37.976
possibly totally invisible to our eyes.

932
00:37:37.976 --> 00:37:39.976
So that's why I think they're interdimensional,

933
00:37:39.976 --> 00:37:44.114
beams energy into the field and in such a way

934
00:37:44.114 --> 00:37:46.081
that it affects the plant.

935
00:37:46.081 --> 00:37:50.955
And the plant actually bends out of volition.

936
00:37:50.955 --> 00:37:52.221
It's not forced.

937
00:37:52.221 --> 00:37:53.391
It does what it does.

938
00:37:53.391 --> 00:37:54.323
<v Regina>It's still healthy and intact.</v>

939
00:37:54.323 --> 00:37:56.760
<v ->Exactly, it's still healthy and intact in most cases.</v>

940
00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.170
<v Regina>Except for the borders.</v>

941
00:37:58.170 --> 00:37:59.971
<v ->Well, the borders and also when the plants</v>

942
00:37:59.971 --> 00:38:03.032
are really, really ripe and it's very dry.

943
00:38:03.032 --> 00:38:05.001
In August they're brittle and they'll break.

944
00:38:05.001 --> 00:38:07.838
To just look at one they break.

945
00:38:07.838 --> 00:38:11.007
But if the plants are green and still with water in them

946
00:38:11.007 --> 00:38:13.013
and healthy, they don't break most of them.

947
00:38:13.013 --> 00:38:16.547
At least 60, 70% will be bent but not broken stalks.

948
00:38:16.547 --> 00:38:18.580
And one of the things in crop circle research

949
00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:21.053
that people show a time and again is what we call

950
00:38:21.053 --> 00:38:22.754
the magic bend which is great.

951
00:38:22.754 --> 00:38:25.622
Because if nobody walks on the crop circle formation

952
00:38:25.622 --> 00:38:28.192
it will actually come back up through photosynthesis

953
00:38:28.192 --> 00:38:29.125
toward the sun.

954
00:38:29.125 --> 00:38:31.332
So you have this bend, and then back up again.

955
00:38:31.332 --> 00:38:34.033
It's kind of a backward S kind of bend,

956
00:38:34.033 --> 00:38:35.694
and I love that when we see that.

957
00:38:35.694 --> 00:38:38.567
There was one year that they had hoof-and-mouth disease

958
00:38:38.567 --> 00:38:39.935
and nobody could be in the fields,

959
00:38:39.935 --> 00:38:41.169
and nobody could walk in the crop circles.

960
00:38:41.169 --> 00:38:44.054
And we say more magic bends that year

961
00:38:44.054 --> 00:38:45.810
than any year I have ever seen.

962
00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:48.847
I think it was 2004, something like that.

963
00:38:48.847 --> 00:38:50.015
<v Regina>So we're here now,</v>

964
00:38:50.015 --> 00:38:55.015
it's coming toward the close of 2007 at this point.

965
00:38:55.384 --> 00:38:57.287
A number of things have been spun into motion.

966
00:38:57.287 --> 00:38:58.887
We have very interesting political affairs,

967
00:38:58.887 --> 00:39:01.157
economic affairs going on and so forth.

968
00:39:01.157 --> 00:39:04.028
What is your personal view from everything you've seen

969
00:39:04.028 --> 00:39:06.699
in your own progressions, others progressions,

970
00:39:06.699 --> 00:39:08.597
the information from the Hopi, the crop circles,

971
00:39:08.597 --> 00:39:10.972
where do you put us?

972
00:39:10.972 --> 00:39:14.206
<v ->First of all, the unconscious and subconscious mind</v>

973
00:39:14.206 --> 00:39:15.705
doesn't like dates.

974
00:39:15.705 --> 00:39:17.973
And even though Dr. Wambach said my work

975
00:39:17.973 --> 00:39:20.976
was based on dates because that's where the linear

976
00:39:20.976 --> 00:39:24.082
rational mind likes, it doesn't work that way.

977
00:39:24.082 --> 00:39:25.648
<v Regina>Well that's okay, let's get rid of the date.</v>

978
00:39:25.648 --> 00:39:27.016
<v ->It works in sequence.</v>

979
00:39:27.016 --> 00:39:29.152
So we're talking sequence here.

980
00:39:29.152 --> 00:39:30.760
But the dates are important nonetheless,

981
00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.543
because we have to position ourselves.

982
00:39:32.543 --> 00:39:37.161
And even the Mayans and Hopi, they have a place in time

983
00:39:37.161 --> 00:39:39.295
at which their calendar turns over.

984
00:39:39.295 --> 00:39:43.433
And they say whatever it is like the crest of a wave

985
00:39:43.433 --> 00:39:46.403
it is so much in motion now that the wave

986
00:39:46.403 --> 00:39:49.042
is going to carry and go into something new

987
00:39:49.042 --> 00:39:51.944
no matter what you do to try to stop it.

988
00:39:51.944 --> 00:39:54.377
If you're surfing, there comes a point when you have

989
00:39:54.377 --> 00:39:57.881
to get into the curl of the wave or else you get wiped out.

990
00:39:57.881 --> 00:39:59.549
<v Regina>Well, we feel like we're entering that curl.</v>

991
00:39:59.549 --> 00:40:01.119
<v ->And we're in that curl, exactly right.</v>

992
00:40:01.119 --> 00:40:05.522
What I found in my research, first two things.

993
00:40:05.522 --> 00:40:09.324
One is that something happened approximately

994
00:40:09.324 --> 00:40:14.163
nine years ago, or eight years ago.

995
00:40:14.163 --> 00:40:18.067
And that was, no one knows,

996
00:40:18.067 --> 00:40:22.432
1992 was a watershed year.

997
00:40:22.432 --> 00:40:25.307
I don't know what happened, all I can say is

998
00:40:25.307 --> 00:40:29.845
that something happened globally the pushed back

999
00:40:29.845 --> 00:40:34.551
all of the earth-change agenda by about 10 years.

1000
00:40:34.551 --> 00:40:37.086
Very interesting, if you look statistically,

1001
00:40:37.086 --> 00:40:39.321
and remember I do statistical work.

1002
00:40:39.321 --> 00:40:43.559
Earthquakes and volcanic activity were rising

1003
00:40:43.559 --> 00:40:47.732
from about 1975 to 1991 or 2.

1004
00:40:47.732 --> 00:40:51.236
Crop circles peaked in '91, '92, and then fell off.

1005
00:40:51.236 --> 00:40:54.371
A lot in paranormal activity and a lot of

1006
00:40:54.371 --> 00:40:58.440
earth-change prediction activity it disappeared.

1007
00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.412
There were people who, in fact, were very popular.

1008
00:41:01.412 --> 00:41:04.050
I won't name names in this, but suddenly they lost

1009
00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:05.450
their audience because their predictions,

1010
00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:09.057
rather dire ones about next year were not happening.

1011
00:41:09.057 --> 00:41:11.554
And this all took place in '92, '93.

1012
00:41:11.554 --> 00:41:13.088
Then we went through a hiatus period

1013
00:41:13.088 --> 00:41:17.405
of earth changes diminish statistically,

1014
00:41:17.405 --> 00:41:21.563
looking at it annually until about 2001, 2002.

1015
00:41:21.563 --> 00:41:24.267
And all of the sudden, 10 years later bam,

1016
00:41:24.267 --> 00:41:25.767
they're now going off the charts.

1017
00:41:25.767 --> 00:41:29.067
And the earth changes have started up again.

1018
00:41:29.067 --> 00:41:31.807
All of the predictions have started up again.

1019
00:41:31.807 --> 00:41:34.410
The prophets in the Native traditions are out there again.

1020
00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:37.713
They had kind of said oh well, we weren't wrong,

1021
00:41:37.713 --> 00:41:39.190
it's just whatever happened.

1022
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:41.149
Something happened, and I don't know what happened.

1023
00:41:41.149 --> 00:41:44.120
All I can tell you is that it was very clear.

1024
00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:47.531
I did some testing over the years from '94, '95

1025
00:41:47.531 --> 00:41:50.993
because about '95 I realized hey, this isn't happening

1026
00:41:50.993 --> 00:41:53.199
the way we thought it was going to happen.

1027
00:41:53.199 --> 00:41:54.566
And that's the dating problem.

1028
00:41:54.566 --> 00:41:56.598
That's the linear time problem.

1029
00:41:56.598 --> 00:41:58.951
But it's important to understand in our conversation

1030
00:41:58.951 --> 00:42:03.271
because of this hiatus, this period.

1031
00:42:03.271 --> 00:42:06.176
One of the things I had seen that I'd never understood

1032
00:42:06.176 --> 00:42:08.180
in the progression experiences, I didn't write it down

1033
00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.045
because it was something that made no sense to me.

1034
00:42:10.045 --> 00:42:13.182
It was like three bricks in a wall.

1035
00:42:13.182 --> 00:42:16.218
And you know how bricks are delineated by vertical lines.

1036
00:42:16.218 --> 00:42:19.321
And then all of a sudden two, one of the middle bricks

1037
00:42:19.321 --> 00:42:21.861
popped up and the other two bricks slammed together.

1038
00:42:21.861 --> 00:42:23.864
And I saw that vision two or three times

1039
00:42:23.864 --> 00:42:25.596
at the end or the beginning of these sessions.

1040
00:42:25.596 --> 00:42:27.696
And I suspect that that brick that popped up

1041
00:42:27.696 --> 00:42:29.199
is those 10, 11 years.

1042
00:42:29.199 --> 00:42:29.899
<v Regina>That missing time.</v>

1043
00:42:29.899 --> 00:42:31.066
<v ->That missing time.</v>

1044
00:42:31.066 --> 00:42:35.204
And now it's as if we were given, I think a great gift.

1045
00:42:35.204 --> 00:42:36.872
<v Regina>Yes, some reprieve to get it together.</v>

1046
00:42:36.872 --> 00:42:40.215
<v ->Exactly, and a chance for a greater proportion</v>

1047
00:42:40.215 --> 00:42:43.546
of our current human population and civilization

1048
00:42:43.546 --> 00:42:45.683
to get it together.

1049
00:42:45.683 --> 00:42:47.951
Certainly the organic movement has blossomed

1050
00:42:47.951 --> 00:42:49.551
in these 10 years.

1051
00:42:49.551 --> 00:42:52.154
The green ecological movement has blossomed

1052
00:42:52.154 --> 00:42:53.755
in these 10 years.

1053
00:42:53.755 --> 00:42:56.458
There's been a lot of people getting back in touch

1054
00:42:56.458 --> 00:42:59.133
to their roots, whether it is from European,

1055
00:42:59.133 --> 00:43:02.678
or African, or Native American indigenous roots.

1056
00:43:02.678 --> 00:43:04.767
We just came from Hawaii where now we're in touch

1057
00:43:04.767 --> 00:43:05.835
with some Hawaiians.

1058
00:43:05.835 --> 00:43:10.835
Their whole culture has been sewn back together

1059
00:43:11.176 --> 00:43:12.910
in many respects in these 10 years.

1060
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:17.279
So something in this reprieve of time has, I think,

1061
00:43:17.279 --> 00:43:19.017
come to our benefit.

1062
00:43:19.017 --> 00:43:20.033
<v Regina>A little period of grace.</v>

1063
00:43:20.033 --> 00:43:22.985
<v ->Exactly, and hopefully people have learned from this.</v>

1064
00:43:22.985 --> 00:43:24.088
That's what I would say.

1065
00:43:24.088 --> 00:43:26.629
If I've spent any time in that period I've learned this

1066
00:43:26.629 --> 00:43:28.939
about '96, '97 as I started doing this research.

1067
00:43:28.939 --> 00:43:31.494
And I would say to people, here are some predictions.

1068
00:43:31.494 --> 00:43:33.265
If this and this and this happen,

1069
00:43:33.265 --> 00:43:34.898
then we're on the fast track.

1070
00:43:34.898 --> 00:43:36.961
And if they don't happen, we're on the middle track.

1071
00:43:36.961 --> 00:43:38.501
And then let's look at this and this and this.

1072
00:43:38.501 --> 00:43:40.136
And if they happen, maybe we're on the slow track.

1073
00:43:40.136 --> 00:43:41.637
Well, for about four or five years

1074
00:43:41.637 --> 00:43:45.393
the slow track predominated, then the middle track.

1075
00:43:45.393 --> 00:43:49.568
It was very interesting, about August 2001

1076
00:43:49.568 --> 00:43:53.041
the crop circles suddenly came to a whole new level.

1077
00:43:53.041 --> 00:43:57.286
In fact, there was a really significant answer that came

1078
00:43:57.286 --> 00:44:01.090
to some cosmological questions that we had sent

1079
00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:03.858
out into space decades before.

1080
00:44:03.858 --> 00:44:05.361
And guess what happened?

1081
00:44:05.361 --> 00:44:08.131
All of this information was about to pop in the press

1082
00:44:08.131 --> 00:44:12.223
when 9/11 took place.

1083
00:44:12.223 --> 00:44:17.005
Everything changed, and suddenly that brick popped up.

1084
00:44:17.005 --> 00:44:19.909
The two slammed together is in my mind

1085
00:44:19.909 --> 00:44:21.244
is what I saw.

1086
00:44:21.244 --> 00:44:23.012
And here we are on the timeline again.

1087
00:44:23.012 --> 00:44:24.112
<v Regina>Back on the fast track.</v>

1088
00:44:24.112 --> 00:44:25.314
<v ->Back on the fast track, yes.</v>

1089
00:44:25.314 --> 00:44:27.516
<v Regina>So how are you seeing the fast track progressing?</v>

1090
00:44:27.516 --> 00:44:29.685
<v ->I see the fast track continuing to progress,</v>

1091
00:44:29.685 --> 00:44:30.886
I really do.

1092
00:44:30.886 --> 00:44:33.456
Right now, we, Edgar Cayce and others

1093
00:44:33.456 --> 00:44:34.257
have talked about this.

1094
00:44:34.257 --> 00:44:36.558
We have done the sequence of a tsunami

1095
00:44:36.558 --> 00:44:39.895
and tidal waves that devastate India and Indonesia.

1096
00:44:39.895 --> 00:44:41.229
That's the Indian Ocean.

1097
00:44:41.229 --> 00:44:44.767
The next segment is Japan and the Western Pacific rim.

1098
00:44:44.767 --> 00:44:47.103
And right now we're having more undersea

1099
00:44:47.103 --> 00:44:49.738
earthquakes of deep magnitude.

1100
00:44:49.738 --> 00:44:52.374
And some are up into seven point whatevers,

1101
00:44:52.374 --> 00:44:53.442
in that part of the world.

1102
00:44:53.442 --> 00:44:54.609
I think they're going to continue

1103
00:44:54.609 --> 00:44:56.412
for another 18 months, possibly.

1104
00:44:56.412 --> 00:44:59.549
Then, from there oddly enough, it doesn't end up

1105
00:44:59.549 --> 00:45:01.150
going around to the Western United States.

1106
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:04.219
It ricochets and hits the Mediterranean.

1107
00:45:04.219 --> 00:45:08.157
Under the Iranian and Turkish and Mediterranean plates.

1108
00:45:08.157 --> 00:45:10.892
And suddenly, I think North Africa and Italy,

1109
00:45:10.892 --> 00:45:13.128
Southern France are going to have a lot of problems

1110
00:45:13.128 --> 00:45:16.733
at that point in time after 18 months to two years from now.

1111
00:45:16.733 --> 00:45:19.535
Then it ricochets over to the Caribbean area,

1112
00:45:19.535 --> 00:45:22.405
Martinique and the volcanic activity in the Caribbean.

1113
00:45:22.405 --> 00:45:24.173
We may see a volcano errupt.

1114
00:45:24.173 --> 00:45:27.009
And then, only after that, and that's so we're already

1115
00:45:27.009 --> 00:45:28.478
five, six years in the future,

1116
00:45:28.478 --> 00:45:31.013
it will hit the United States in California.

1117
00:45:31.013 --> 00:45:33.515
The things that I saw going on in '98

1118
00:45:33.515 --> 00:45:36.719
very likely are going to happen around 2012,

1119
00:45:36.719 --> 00:45:38.553
that's five years from now, you see?

1120
00:45:38.553 --> 00:45:42.858
<v Regina>And even NASA, by NASA's own science</v>

1121
00:45:42.858 --> 00:45:45.595
are showing that this is a very volatile period of time

1122
00:45:45.595 --> 00:45:49.031
cosmologically, which deeply impacts the sun and the Earth.

1123
00:45:49.031 --> 00:45:51.534
<v ->Well the sun's part of the picture, isn't it?</v>

1124
00:45:51.534 --> 00:45:56.138
<v Regina>Exactly, every, all roads lead to 2012 it seems.</v>

1125
00:45:56.138 --> 00:45:57.472
<v ->Well, they do, they do.</v>

1126
00:45:57.472 --> 00:46:00.584
And I don't think there's going to be any one event in 2012.

1127
00:46:00.584 --> 00:46:03.512
And when we say 2012, it may be 13, 14, 15.

1128
00:46:03.512 --> 00:46:05.948
Good grief, these are predictions that are thousands

1129
00:46:05.948 --> 00:46:07.262
of years old.

1130
00:46:07.262 --> 00:46:09.622
Again, don't get wedded into it.

1131
00:46:09.622 --> 00:46:10.987
And people shouldn't be thinking like that.

1132
00:46:10.987 --> 00:46:12.321
<v Regina>It's that rough period of time.</v>

1133
00:46:12.321 --> 00:46:13.689
<v ->And sequence.</v>

1134
00:46:13.689 --> 00:46:14.590
<v Regina>Yes, and sequence.</v>

1135
00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:15.790
<v ->I tell people this, look at the sequence.</v>

1136
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:16.826
We've seen the Indian Ocean.

1137
00:46:16.826 --> 00:46:18.795
Now we're seeing the heating up of the Western Pacific,

1138
00:46:18.795 --> 00:46:20.265
exactly what was predicted.

1139
00:46:20.265 --> 00:46:23.266
There may be a major event in Japan that will come up.

1140
00:46:23.266 --> 00:46:26.703
And the expect it to shift toward Europe.

1141
00:46:26.703 --> 00:46:29.172
And the from Europe, expect it to shift to the East Coast,

1142
00:46:29.172 --> 00:46:31.140
then expect it to shift to the West Coast.

1143
00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:32.542
<v Regina>And as you said, the words you're using</v>

1144
00:46:32.542 --> 00:46:33.608
right there, shift.

1145
00:46:33.608 --> 00:46:34.777
Shift is the big thing.

1146
00:46:34.777 --> 00:46:39.048
This isn't the end of times, it marches on.

1147
00:46:39.048 --> 00:46:41.017
We march on, the earth marches on.

1148
00:46:41.017 --> 00:46:42.018
This is a shift.

1149
00:46:42.018 --> 00:46:44.620
<v ->The human family will march on in some form or another.</v>

1150
00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:47.589
Even if we go back to a Biblical scenario

1151
00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:52.589
of the great flood or whatever you want, humans survived.

1152
00:46:52.962 --> 00:46:57.133
What we know about that is that Noah was not the only one.

1153
00:46:57.133 --> 00:46:58.668
That there were survivors up in the Andes.

1154
00:46:58.668 --> 00:47:00.402
There were survivors in Africa.

1155
00:47:00.402 --> 00:47:03.172
There were survivors in Siberia.

1156
00:47:03.172 --> 00:47:06.441
And that will be true of whatever happens in 2012

1157
00:47:06.441 --> 00:47:07.643
or later.

1158
00:47:07.643 --> 00:47:10.913
And it may not come in as volatile a form.

1159
00:47:10.913 --> 00:47:12.214
<v Regina>Right, we may soften some of it.</v>

1160
00:47:12.214 --> 00:47:13.850
<v ->I think we have.</v>

1161
00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:16.018
Personally I think we were given this grace period

1162
00:47:16.018 --> 00:47:19.220
which isn't talked about a lot in people who do predictions

1163
00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.690
and stuff because one thing I've learned in America

1164
00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:24.192
at least, is that in our culture

1165
00:47:24.192 --> 00:47:26.162
we live in a culture of fear.

1166
00:47:26.162 --> 00:47:28.997
People love to get people afraid.

1167
00:47:28.997 --> 00:47:31.334
And actually, people like to be frightened.

1168
00:47:31.334 --> 00:47:32.434
I have had a number of people say,

1169
00:47:32.434 --> 00:47:34.371
well you're too tame in what you're telling us.

1170
00:47:34.371 --> 00:47:36.306
Wait a minute, what's this about?

1171
00:47:36.306 --> 00:47:38.674
I want to know, you know, I want to know tomorrow

1172
00:47:38.674 --> 00:47:41.611
everything's going to rattle and roll.

1173
00:47:41.611 --> 00:47:44.947
Every year we have something new that fear mongers

1174
00:47:44.947 --> 00:47:47.083
go out and tell us is going to happen tomorrow

1175
00:47:47.083 --> 00:47:49.285
and then it doesn't, usually.

1176
00:47:49.285 --> 00:47:50.819
Sometimes it does, or a little bit of it may,

1177
00:47:50.819 --> 00:47:52.055
but not really.

1178
00:47:52.055 --> 00:47:54.156
And then, oh there's a new excuse for why it didn't.

1179
00:47:54.156 --> 00:47:56.558
So I think that we have to be very careful

1180
00:47:56.558 --> 00:47:58.861
when we make predictions about change

1181
00:47:58.861 --> 00:48:02.731
and about shifting that the shift can take place physically,

1182
00:48:02.731 --> 00:48:05.367
it can take place in consciousness mentally,

1183
00:48:05.367 --> 00:48:07.969
it can take place in the subconscious mind where we

1184
00:48:07.969 --> 00:48:11.106
suddenly realize that we are in a relationship

1185
00:48:11.106 --> 00:48:14.577
with each other and with the earth that we'd forgotten.

1186
00:48:14.577 --> 00:48:19.577
I will say, now maybe this is the 60-year old man talking,

1187
00:48:20.048 --> 00:48:24.053
that one of the problems, the internet is extraordinary,

1188
00:48:24.053 --> 00:48:28.961
but it nonetheless is all cyberspace and not real.

1189
00:48:28.961 --> 00:48:32.428
And while it has a great potential for communication,

1190
00:48:32.428 --> 00:48:35.764
if you don't get out and smell the flowers,

1191
00:48:35.764 --> 00:48:37.766
if you don't get out and weed the lawn,

1192
00:48:37.766 --> 00:48:39.501
if you don't have a lawn,

1193
00:48:39.501 --> 00:48:41.903
you only live in that electronic box,

1194
00:48:41.903 --> 00:48:43.773
you're probably going to be disappointed

1195
00:48:43.773 --> 00:48:46.842
with what happens because that's going to get taken away.

1196
00:48:46.842 --> 00:48:49.611
<v Regina>You're saying it beautifully.</v>

1197
00:48:49.611 --> 00:48:53.015
I agree with you, that's what I feel too.

1198
00:48:53.015 --> 00:48:55.451
<v ->I think we need to come to a balance.</v>

1199
00:48:55.451 --> 00:48:57.386
And the Hopi talk about that balance all the time.

1200
00:48:57.386 --> 00:48:58.554
That's their whole thing.

1201
00:48:58.554 --> 00:49:00.189
The Earth has been brought out of balance

1202
00:49:00.189 --> 00:49:02.924
by our culture and by the Europeans coming here.

1203
00:49:02.924 --> 00:49:04.998
And the Hawaiians talk about that.

1204
00:49:04.998 --> 00:49:06.799
Their whole thing of aloha is how you take

1205
00:49:06.799 --> 00:49:10.833
any situation and create a loving relationship

1206
00:49:10.833 --> 00:49:14.103
out of that situation, even if it's bad.

1207
00:49:14.103 --> 00:49:17.105
And you can create a positive emotional impact

1208
00:49:17.105 --> 00:49:20.042
from whatever it is in your life if you will allow

1209
00:49:20.042 --> 00:49:23.913
yourself to see and go and broaden the picture.

1210
00:49:23.913 --> 00:49:28.016
Those are the kinds of things I think have to be fostered.

1211
00:49:28.016 --> 00:49:29.785
I think we have to work with people.

1212
00:49:29.785 --> 00:49:32.555
Like the crop circles, they bring people

1213
00:49:32.555 --> 00:49:36.325
of all different walks of life together.

1214
00:49:36.325 --> 00:49:39.228
Past-life work or progression work is fascinating.

1215
00:49:39.228 --> 00:49:41.730
For one thing, if someone has never done that

1216
00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:44.800
they probably don't know who they are.

1217
00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:47.769
And learning who you are at a multi-dimensional level

1218
00:49:47.769 --> 00:49:50.305
is a key to surviving,

1219
00:49:50.305 --> 00:49:51.140
<v Regina>Indeed.</v>

1220
00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:52.074
<v ->in the future.</v>

1221
00:49:52.074 --> 00:49:54.009
So I would recommend that to anybody

1222
00:49:54.009 --> 00:49:58.413
because it is that coming to that self-realization

1223
00:49:58.413 --> 00:50:02.718
and seeing in yourself that you have a root

1224
00:50:02.718 --> 00:50:05.521
that spreads like a tree branch through the many

1225
00:50:05.521 --> 00:50:07.056
different places along the planet.

1226
00:50:07.056 --> 00:50:10.558
In my regressions that I did with Helen,

1227
00:50:10.558 --> 00:50:12.360
I remember very distinctly that stood out,

1228
00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:14.229
the one in France was very important to me.

1229
00:50:14.229 --> 00:50:17.266
Or Gascogne, because I wasn't French, I was Gascogne.

1230
00:50:17.266 --> 00:50:18.968
But I went to France and I actually went

1231
00:50:18.968 --> 00:50:20.135
around the Mediterranean.

1232
00:50:20.135 --> 00:50:21.870
I remember another one that was very important to me

1233
00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:25.241
where I was a Black African woman

1234
00:50:25.241 --> 00:50:27.448
who got sold into slavery by her own people,

1235
00:50:27.448 --> 00:50:28.277
or by their enemies.

1236
00:50:28.277 --> 00:50:30.479
In other words, it was Blacks doing it to Blacks.

1237
00:50:30.479 --> 00:50:31.380
And that taught me something.

1238
00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:33.851
It said, wait a minute, this is a human problem.

1239
00:50:33.851 --> 00:50:38.087
And then we stomped out indego vines

1240
00:50:38.087 --> 00:50:41.156
and made blue dyes somewhere in the Caribbean area.

1241
00:50:41.156 --> 00:50:45.161
And then another one where I was in a Native situation

1242
00:50:45.161 --> 00:50:48.664
out in the Pacific and had to learn about the sea

1243
00:50:48.664 --> 00:50:53.135
and the boats and talk with sharks, talk with fish.

1244
00:50:53.135 --> 00:50:55.070
<v Regina>It is truly an amazing process</v>

1245
00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:58.607
to be able to reconnect with other realities

1246
00:50:58.607 --> 00:51:01.510
that are woven as part of your own fabric.

1247
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:02.311
<v ->And they're all within.</v>

1248
00:51:02.311 --> 00:51:03.416
<v Regina>And they're all within and they're all</v>

1249
00:51:03.416 --> 00:51:05.214
within each one of us to some degree or another.

1250
00:51:05.214 --> 00:51:06.248
<v ->Every person has that story.</v>

1251
00:51:06.248 --> 00:51:08.317
<v Regina>I think that knowledge is incredibly important.</v>

1252
00:51:08.317 --> 00:51:09.484
<v ->I think absolutely, and you can project that</v>

1253
00:51:09.484 --> 00:51:10.919
on into the future.

1254
00:51:10.919 --> 00:51:13.256
And that's what the future progressions do.

1255
00:51:13.256 --> 00:51:15.558
The therapy part of them is very interesting

1256
00:51:15.558 --> 00:51:18.694
because you can actually project the consequences

1257
00:51:18.694 --> 00:51:21.063
maybe of what you're doing and living today.

1258
00:51:21.063 --> 00:51:22.498
I once worked with a rock producer

1259
00:51:22.498 --> 00:51:24.467
and I won't say that he changed, I honestly don't know.

1260
00:51:24.467 --> 00:51:27.672
But I think he did, because he saw how he was treating

1261
00:51:27.672 --> 00:51:29.872
women and how he would become a woman

1262
00:51:29.872 --> 00:51:31.540
and what he would be going through.

1263
00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:34.810
It was very interesting, that whole story in itself.

1264
00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:37.813
<v Regina>Yes, now these are journeys,</v>

1265
00:51:37.813 --> 00:51:39.848
these are journeys, I'm with you.

1266
00:51:39.848 --> 00:51:42.485
We all need to undertake them if we haven't already.

1267
00:51:42.485 --> 00:51:45.588
And I think that your words are very wise in terms

1268
00:51:45.588 --> 00:51:49.591
of the balance again and also in terms of understanding

1269
00:51:49.591 --> 00:51:51.994
that the information is coming through many streams.

1270
00:51:51.994 --> 00:51:55.598
whichever stream we have the ability to relate to,

1271
00:51:55.598 --> 00:51:58.234
to understand, is the stream we should follow.

1272
00:51:58.234 --> 00:52:00.872
And this is a transition, this is a shift.

1273
00:52:00.872 --> 00:52:02.240
<v ->What you tap into.</v>

1274
00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:04.973
And as you start to tap in, and then the great

1275
00:52:04.973 --> 00:52:06.341
law of attraction which everybody's

1276
00:52:06.341 --> 00:52:08.377
talking a lot about today, the secret as it's called.

1277
00:52:08.377 --> 00:52:09.744
It's no secret, of course.

1278
00:52:09.744 --> 00:52:12.080
It's a known to people around the planet.

1279
00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.649
But that will kick into place.

1280
00:52:13.649 --> 00:52:17.319
And as you tap into what is real for you

1281
00:52:17.319 --> 00:52:20.922
suddenly synchronicities will pop up in your life.

1282
00:52:20.922 --> 00:52:22.358
Positive things will start to happen.

1283
00:52:22.358 --> 00:52:24.159
You will meet the people you're supposed to meet.

1284
00:52:24.159 --> 00:52:27.128
You will be taken to a place you didn't even know existed.

1285
00:52:27.128 --> 00:52:28.896
And you'll be doing the work you were supposed to do.

1286
00:52:28.896 --> 00:52:31.003
That's what I feel happened with me with Helen Wambach,

1287
00:52:31.003 --> 00:52:32.301
to come back to the beginning of this.

1288
00:52:32.301 --> 00:52:34.403
And as I say, if I hadn't had that happen,

1289
00:52:34.403 --> 00:52:37.539
did I make it up as a soul at some point?

1290
00:52:37.539 --> 00:52:38.373
Maybe.

1291
00:52:38.373 --> 00:52:41.442
Or was it totally synchronistic or by chance?

1292
00:52:41.442 --> 00:52:43.385
I don't believe in chance, actually ultimately.

1293
00:52:43.385 --> 00:52:47.983
I think we're guided invisibly more than we like to think.

1294
00:52:47.983 --> 00:52:49.017
<v Regina>And through your work</v>

1295
00:52:49.017 --> 00:52:50.786
you're guiding many others now.

1296
00:52:50.786 --> 00:52:52.187
You're putting these conferences together.

1297
00:52:52.187 --> 00:52:54.923
You're taking people where this information is.

1298
00:52:54.923 --> 00:52:57.593
I think it's fair to say you're doing your part.

1299
00:52:57.593 --> 00:52:59.528
<v ->Well, I hope so, and that's what I try for.</v>

1300
00:52:59.528 --> 00:53:00.696
<v Regina>I think so.</v>

1301
00:53:00.696 --> 00:53:02.557
<v ->And I was given the right partner.</v>

1302
00:53:02.557 --> 00:53:06.835
We're doing what we can do in a small way

1303
00:53:06.835 --> 00:53:10.038
to again, help people to know themselves.

1304
00:53:10.038 --> 00:53:12.408
The ultimately that's what I think we have to get to.

1305
00:53:12.408 --> 00:53:13.274
<v Regina>Know thyself.</v>

1306
00:53:13.274 --> 00:53:16.180
<v ->You know yourself if you can find what's in your heart</v>

1307
00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:18.018
and you can live what's in your heart

1308
00:53:18.018 --> 00:53:19.014
even in a small way.

1309
00:53:19.014 --> 00:53:20.849
Even with all the warts and problems that we all have

1310
00:53:20.849 --> 00:53:23.085
in our lives, you will still be doing

1311
00:53:23.085 --> 00:53:24.753
what you're supposed to do right at this time.

1312
00:53:24.753 --> 00:53:28.756
And the earth changes will respond to that.

1313
00:53:28.756 --> 00:53:32.327
They may happen, but they may not happen to you

1314
00:53:32.327 --> 00:53:33.295
or in your face.

1315
00:53:33.295 --> 00:53:35.597
And you'll be at the right place at the right time

1316
00:53:35.597 --> 00:53:37.899
to reap the benefits from what will take place

1317
00:53:37.899 --> 00:53:39.401
for the whole planet.

1318
00:53:39.401 --> 00:53:41.743
That's how I see it.

1319
00:53:41.743 --> 00:53:42.570
<v Regina>Thank you.</v>

1320
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:44.455
<v ->Thank you, it's a pleasure.</v>

1321
00:53:46.712 --> 00:53:48.877
<v ->To pick up a copy of Mass Dreams of the Future,</v>

1323
00:53:50.412 --> 00:53:52.313
You might also want to visit Chet's website

1324
00:53:52.313 --> 00:53:55.153
for updates on his annual conference in Phoenix

1325
00:53:55.153 --> 00:53:56.518
and see who's presenting.

1326
00:53:56.518 --> 00:53:58.887
It would make a wonderful consciousness oriented vacation

1327
00:53:58.887 --> 00:54:00.121
in the desert.

1328
00:54:00.121 --> 00:54:03.044
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
