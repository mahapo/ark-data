00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>Digging deep is the
hallmark of science journalist

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Graham Hancock, who has
sold over five million books

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.670 align:middle line:84%
featuring his scientific
research into the mysteries

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.980 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient
structures and texts,

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.590 align:middle line:90%
archaeoastronomy, and beyond.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Now he's delving into the
ultimate mystery and the least

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.570 align:middle line:84%
understood, that of
the spirit world.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.380 align:middle line:84%
His journey took
him to Brazil, where

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.240 align:middle line:84%
he drank from the ayahuasca
cup with the elder shamans.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:35.330 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.800 align:middle line:90%
Well, where to begin?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.520 align:middle line:84%
We could start in
the jungles of Peru,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.030 align:middle line:84%
where you began exploring
the subject of, in essence,

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.010 align:middle line:84%
expanded consciousness
through the root.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Would you call it
a root, a vine?

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:48.749 align:middle line:90%
>>A vine.

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:50.040 align:middle line:90%
They call it the Vine of Souls.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.873 align:middle line:90%
>>The Vine of Souls.

00:00:50.873 --> 00:00:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>Ayahuasca.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that I
came to this substance

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.610 align:middle line:84%
was because I wanted
to investigate

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.540 align:middle line:90%
a mystery in human history.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.250 align:middle line:84%
It's very clear from
the evidence that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.530 align:middle line:84%
the art of the painted caves
of upper Paleolithic Europe,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.830 align:middle line:84%
about 35,000 years ago down
to about 10,000 years ago,

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.680 align:middle line:84%
and the art of, for example,
the sand bushmen of Southern

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Africa, which also
goes back 27,000 years,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.170 align:middle line:84%
is an art of altered
state of consciousness.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.330 align:middle line:84%
These artists were
putting themselves

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.920 align:middle line:84%
into an altered state either
using plant hallucinogens

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.980 align:middle line:84%
or using other techniques like
prolonged rhythmic dancing.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.752 align:middle line:84%
And they were then
painting the visions

00:01:33.752 --> 00:01:35.960 align:middle line:84%
that they saw in this altered
state of consciousness.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've always
believed as a writer

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.110 align:middle line:84%
that if I'm going to
explore a subject,

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.830 align:middle line:90%
I must explore it personally.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:84%
I must put myself
into that story.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.234 align:middle line:84%
And for that reason,
I felt if I was

00:01:46.234 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:84%
going to write about the role of
altered states of consciousness

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.370 align:middle line:84%
in human culture
and human history,

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.203 align:middle line:84%
I had to experience
those states for myself.

00:01:52.203 --> 00:01:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And it so happens that there's
a very ancient shamanic culture

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.360 align:middle line:90%
in the Amazon.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.000 align:middle line:84%
It goes back at
least 10,000 years,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.720 align:middle line:84%
which makes use of this
extraordinary beverage,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.540 align:middle line:84%
ayahuasca , which is in fact
a mixture of two plants.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.020 align:middle line:90%
One of them is a vine.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And the other is a
leaf that contains

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.945 align:middle line:90%
the potent hallucinogen DMT.

00:02:11.945 --> 00:02:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And when mixed together, they
produce extraordinary effects.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.595 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the Amazon to
drink Ayahuasca with the shamans

00:02:19.595 --> 00:02:20.095 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:02:20.095 --> 00:02:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>>And you didn't go
on an overnighter.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.450 align:middle line:90%
You spent a few weeks there.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>>I spent five
weeks in the Amazon.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to get
into this in depth.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:84%
The ayahuasca experience
is extremely potent.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's physically
very, very demanding.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's not something that
you want to do every day.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.590 align:middle line:84%
So I spread my 11
experiences of ayahuasca

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.130 align:middle line:90%
out over a period of five weeks.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:84%
It makes you very ill
when you drink it.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.580 align:middle line:90%
You have have severe vomiting.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.820 align:middle line:90%
You have diarrhea as well.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And you just have
to deal with this.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.150 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult
for Westerners

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.880 align:middle line:90%
to deal with these things.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.671 align:middle line:84%
>>And it tastes, I
heard you say, something

00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:90%
like a frog ground up. [LAUGHS]

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.160 align:middle line:84%
If you could imagine
putting a toad in a blender

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.820 align:middle line:84%
and then drinking
it, this is how

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.130 align:middle line:84%
one might imagine that
Ayahuasca would taste.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>>So far it sounds appealing.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.245 align:middle line:84%
Can we go back for a moment
to the historical roots

00:03:01.245 --> 00:03:04.620 align:middle line:84%
of why you decided you wanted to
explore with this consciousness

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.987 align:middle line:84%
and what the original
inspiration was starting--

00:03:06.987 --> 00:03:09.570 align:middle line:84%
dating back, say, 40,000 years
ago I think I've heard you say?

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, the original
inspiration in my case

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.460 align:middle line:84%
was an intention to explore
the mystery of human origins.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.370 align:middle line:84%
But as I started to look into
the mystery of human origins--

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.730 align:middle line:84%
and we have what you can
call the human career

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.190 align:middle line:84%
from the last common
ancestor with the chimpanzee

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.980 align:middle line:90%
around six million years ago.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.730 align:middle line:84%
As I started to
investigate this material,

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.680 align:middle line:84%
I found that most of the story
is incredibly dull, really

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.930 align:middle line:84%
very, very boring,
that our ancestors,

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.230 align:middle line:84%
as their anatomical
forms slowly,

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.170 align:middle line:84%
slowly changed towards
the modern form,

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.750 align:middle line:84%
behaved for millions
and millions of years

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.220 align:middle line:84%
in an incredibly dull
and uninteresting manner,

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.680 align:middle line:84%
with no creativity,
no symbolism,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.720 align:middle line:84%
no evidence whatsoever
of a spiritual life.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.580 align:middle line:84%
These were simply
tool-using apes.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And even as they
looked exactly like us,

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.640 align:middle line:84%
which happened about
200,000 years ago, when

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.260 align:middle line:84%
full anatomical modernity
was reached, when

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.460 align:middle line:84%
the human brain was the same
size and the same structure

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.160 align:middle line:84%
as the brains that
we have today,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.200 align:middle line:84%
our behavior still
did not change.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And it remained dull
and uninteresting

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.670 align:middle line:84%
with no creativity
and no innovation.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's not until
40,000 years ago it

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.540 align:middle line:84%
seems like a light has been
turned on all around the world.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly the whole
suite of behavior

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.690 align:middle line:84%
that we recognize as human
is introduced all at once.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And what is key to
this change, what

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.840 align:middle line:84%
seems to symbolize it and
sum it up and express it,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.970 align:middle line:84%
is the dawn of art,
the birth of art,

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.380 align:middle line:84%
and the first great
art of the world.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.880 align:middle line:90%
There had never been art before.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, in upper
Paleolithic Europe

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.620 align:middle line:84%
around 35,000 years ago, you
get the most extraordinary art

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.290 align:middle line:90%
being painted.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And this rapidly is
found all over the world.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.640 align:middle line:84%
So it is really
as though a light

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.570 align:middle line:84%
has been switched on
in the human mind.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.760 align:middle line:84%
The brain was there, but
it wasn't being used.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Something happened that
led to it being used.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And I believe--
it's a long story.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.690 align:middle line:84%
We can't go into
it in detail here.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.530 align:middle line:84%
But the evidence is
compelling that what happened

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.307 align:middle line:84%
was that our
ancestors discovered

00:05:05.307 --> 00:05:06.640 align:middle line:90%
altered states of consciousness.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.920 align:middle line:84%
They may have come across
hallucinogenic plants

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.060 align:middle line:90%
by chance.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.090 align:middle line:84%
They may have thought
they were food items.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
consumed them,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.850 align:middle line:84%
it brought about a radical
transformation in the way

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.100 align:middle line:90%
that they looked at the world.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And it changed everything
about being human.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So this, I felt, was
the crucial, the vital,

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.870 align:middle line:84%
before and after moment
in the human story.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.080 align:middle line:84%
It's connected to altered
states of consciousness.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.830 align:middle line:84%
It's connected to the
use plant hallucinogens.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
had to investigate

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.740 align:middle line:90%
this subject this way.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>Before we get into
your personal experience

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.580 align:middle line:84%
and the things that you
saw, one of the things

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.080 align:middle line:84%
I find interesting that you've
lectured about, and coming out

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.700 align:middle line:84%
in your book "Supernatural," is
that the same type of imagery

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.970 align:middle line:84%
seems to have surfaced
around the globe,

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.480 align:middle line:90%
again, in these ancient times.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.110 align:middle line:84%
How do you explain
the types of-- How

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.655 align:middle line:84%
do you explain the similarity
in this type of imagery

00:05:57.655 --> 00:06:00.155 align:middle line:84%
with people who theoretically
had no means of communication?

00:06:00.155 --> 00:06:00.654 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:06:00.654 --> 00:06:03.180 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
extraordinary mysteries.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's the mystery
that I found myself

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.140 align:middle line:84%
confronting most closely
in this research.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.246 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult enough if you
get 20 people together in a room

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:12.620 align:middle line:84%
and have them
witness some event.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.010 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult enough
to get them all

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.370 align:middle line:90%
to agree on what they've seen.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.460 align:middle line:84%
We know this from
psychological studies.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.934 align:middle line:84%
If 10 different people
witness a crime,

00:06:19.934 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:84%
they will give 10
different descriptions

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.470 align:middle line:90%
of the perpetrator.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.210 align:middle line:84%
But here's the bizarre
thing-- in experiences

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.330 align:middle line:84%
that our scientists
define as non-real,

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.800 align:middle line:84%
or illusory, the experiences
that we call hallucinations,

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.050 align:middle line:84%
in those experiences,
people all over the world

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.630 align:middle line:84%
universally report
the same experiences.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And that is the experience
of passing through

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.460 align:middle line:84%
into another realm, which is
absolutely real, convincingly,

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.900 align:middle line:84%
seamlessly real,
which is inhabited

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.380 align:middle line:84%
by intelligent beings
who seem to want

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.460 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with you.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And these beings
often take the form

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.810 align:middle line:84%
of half-animal,
half-human hybrids.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And overlaid against the
perception of these beings,

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.320 align:middle line:84%
there are often geometrical
patterns, grids, zigzags.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.240 align:middle line:90%
Wavy lines appear as well.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.900 align:middle line:90%
And this is universal.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.420 align:middle line:84%
It's found from people
from all different cultures

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.460 align:middle line:84%
and at all different
periods of history.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.470 align:middle line:84%
It's documented in the painted
caves from 35,000 years ago,

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.590 align:middle line:84%
this same experience that
people in modern lab research

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.610 align:middle line:84%
using hallucinogens to
investigate human consciousness

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.170 align:middle line:84%
report encountering, exactly
the same kind of beings,

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.010 align:middle line:84%
the half-human,
half-animal hybrids,

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.870 align:middle line:84%
for example, that
we find painted

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.420 align:middle line:84%
on the walls of the
caves 35,000 years ago.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>>So this begins explaining
some of the shamanic traditions.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.120 align:middle line:90%
And it also--

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>>What it really
tells us is that we

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.460 align:middle line:84%
must try to explain why it
is that people experience

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.710 align:middle line:84%
the same thing in the
supposedly non-real realm.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And one possible explanation
for it-- and that's

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:55.860 align:middle line:84%
the explanation that shamans
all over the world offer--

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.019 align:middle line:84%
is that that other
realm that we enter

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:00.060 align:middle line:84%
in an altered state of
consciousness is, in fact,

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle line:90%
real.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And that is why people
see the same things.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.777 align:middle line:84%
Because they're going
to the same places.

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:07.360 align:middle line:84%
They're projecting
their consciousness

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.250 align:middle line:90%
into the same places.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
shamans believe.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And the shamanic view of
the universe and of reality

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.230 align:middle line:84%
is radically different from
the view of Western science.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Western science believes that
if you cannot weigh something,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.750 align:middle line:84%
measure it, and counted it,
then it simply does not exist.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:23.810 align:middle line:90%
It's not there.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.190 align:middle line:84%
They must be able to approach
it with their instruments.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And if they can't,
it doesn't exist.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.150 align:middle line:90%
It's an illusion.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Shamans review things
quite differently.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.820 align:middle line:84%
They believe that,
whether we like it

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.100 align:middle line:84%
or not, whether we
agree with it or not,

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.730 align:middle line:84%
we are tied up with
a spiritual realm.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And if we wish to deal with
problems in this physical

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.780 align:middle line:84%
world, then we cannot
ignore that spiritual realm.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And often the root
cause of problems

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:47.870 align:middle line:90%
will be in that spiritual realm.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So rather than sticking
their heads in the sand

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:84%
and pretending that it doesn't
exist, what shamans attempt

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.690 align:middle line:84%
to do is to become
masters of that realm.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.525 align:middle line:84%
They develop techniques for
altering their consciousness

00:08:59.525 --> 00:09:00.570 align:middle line:90%
at will.

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And the most widely
used technique

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:03.970 align:middle line:84%
is the use of
hallucinogenic plants.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.060 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
techniques as well.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.010 align:middle line:90%
And they enter the other realm.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:08.850 align:middle line:90%
And they master it.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And they deal with and negotiate
with the spirits there.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And they frequently bring
back useful information

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.300 align:middle line:84%
of great value in
this physical world,

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.980 align:middle line:90%
particularly to do with healing.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.547 align:middle line:84%
>>And isn't this
being validated now

00:09:19.547 --> 00:09:20.880 align:middle line:90%
in the world of quantum physics?

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Michio Kaku's book "Parallel
Worlds," for example.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>>They may not be
extending themselves yet

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:29.210 align:middle line:84%
into what that experience looks
like, but certainly are now

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.890 align:middle line:84%
validating that these
other dimensions do exist.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.570 align:middle line:84%
So at least we're
getting a little bit

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:34.460 align:middle line:84%
of a scientific bridge
there, aren't we?

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>>Most definitely.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.620 align:middle line:84%
This is a bridge, which helps
people in Western culture

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.160 align:middle line:84%
to understand what's
going on here.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Because now, for the first
time, thanks to quantum physics,

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:44.540 align:middle line:84%
which really only
goes back to the 1920s

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.000 align:middle line:84%
or so-- thanks to
quantum physics

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.780 align:middle line:84%
and the insights and
discoveries of quantum physics,

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.300 align:middle line:84%
most people are aware
that the existence

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.750 align:middle line:84%
of parallel dimensions is
a very real possibility.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physicists have
powerful experimental evidence,

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.810 align:middle line:84%
indirect evidence, to suggest
that these parallel dimensions

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:03.580 align:middle line:90%
exist.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And one of the big
projects of quantum physics

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.550 align:middle line:84%
is to crack open the
parallel dimensions,

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.329 align:middle line:90%
to find a way into them.

00:10:09.329 --> 00:10:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the largest
scientific instrument

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.240 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, the Large
Hadron Collider in Switzerland,

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.890 align:middle line:84%
is partly about, a
multi-billion dollar instrument

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.970 align:middle line:84%
designed to explore
parallel dimensions.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.569 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what
shamans have been

00:10:22.569 --> 00:10:24.110 align:middle line:84%
doing for tens of
thousands of years.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.250 align:middle line:84%
They've been exploring
parallel dimensions.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And they call them
spirit worlds.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.284 align:middle line:84%
And they don't need
a gigantic instrument

00:10:30.284 --> 00:10:31.700 align:middle line:84%
buried under
Switzerland to do it.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.440 align:middle line:84%
They use the power of their
own minds, the power that

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.430 align:middle line:90%
is inherent in their own brains.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps what
they're doing is

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.580 align:middle line:84%
re-tuning the receiver
wavelength of the brain.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.420 align:middle line:84%
We need to think of the brain
as a receiver of information,

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.127 align:middle line:90%
as a receiver of consciousness.

00:10:46.127 --> 00:10:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps what they're doing
is re-tuning the receiver

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.890 align:middle line:84%
wavelength so that
it shifts them off,

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:54.110 align:middle line:84%
shall we call it, channel
normal, and puts them

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:57.460 align:middle line:84%
into another channel where the
information that they receive

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.770 align:middle line:84%
is real and is valid, but
is not accessible to us

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.930 align:middle line:84%
in normal states
of consciousness.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>>Interestingly, the
shamanic traditions

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.420 align:middle line:84%
seem to bring forth, as
you have said before,

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.100 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the same
imagery, et cetera.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.930 align:middle line:84%
But I have also read that, in
your understanding of this,

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:19.050 align:middle line:84%
this might also have given
birth to the inspirations that

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.021 align:middle line:90%
became our modern religions.

00:11:21.021 --> 00:11:21.520 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.300 align:middle line:84%
I think there's no
doubt about this.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:28.220 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to the source
of any of the great religions,

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.410 align:middle line:84%
you are going to find
shamanic experiences.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, I realize that
this may cause offense.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And I don't wish to
offend Christians.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.460 align:middle line:84%
I would just ask Christians
to review this information

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.280 align:middle line:90%
with an open mind.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.340 align:middle line:84%
St. Paul and his
Damascus road experience

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.890 align:middle line:84%
is of fundamental
importance to Christianity

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.920 align:middle line:84%
and to the development and
spread of Christianity.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.200 align:middle line:84%
What St. Paul
experienced there was

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.350 align:middle line:84%
a classic shamanic
experience, a blinding light

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.480 align:middle line:84%
and the sense of a complete
change of his life,

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.960 align:middle line:84%
of a whole new flood of
information came into his mind.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And from that, much of
the spread of Christianity

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.260 align:middle line:90%
owes its strength.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Christ himself is a
powerfully shamanic figure.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Many shamans, most shamans,
around the world today

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.210 align:middle line:84%
believe that they are partly
from the spiritual realm,

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:22.860 align:middle line:84%
that they may have a mother or
a father in the spiritual realm,

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.420 align:middle line:84%
and that they are
connected to this world

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.450 align:middle line:90%
and to the spirit world.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And of course Christ is
the same kind of figure.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.770 align:middle line:84%
He's partly divine and partly
human, part spirit, part man.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:36.611 align:middle line:84%
So I think the connections are
very clear and very obvious

00:12:36.611 --> 00:12:37.110 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, the problem is that we
can find this in all religions.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:45.210 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the
Mormons, for example,

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.610 align:middle line:84%
what does Joseph Smith
encounter but an angelic being,

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.670 align:middle line:84%
a supernatural being,
who presents to him

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:55.720 align:middle line:90%
certain texts on golden tablets.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.680 align:middle line:84%
The case of Mani,
the Manichean faith--

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.720 align:middle line:84%
he also had almost
identical experiences.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.390 align:middle line:84%
You can repeat this story
again and again in religions.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.960 align:middle line:84%
At the very source and
heart of the religion

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.840 align:middle line:84%
is a profound experience
that an individual

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.440 align:middle line:84%
or a group of individuals
had in an altered state

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.540 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:16.460 align:middle line:84%
But then what happens is that
the classic, bureaucratic

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.650 align:middle line:84%
structures of humanity
begin to impose themself

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.650 align:middle line:90%
on that original experience.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And within a few
generations, the religion

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:27.370 align:middle line:84%
has moved away from direct
experience of the spirit realm

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.810 align:middle line:84%
and has substituted
a class of priests

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.150 align:middle line:84%
in between us and
the spirit world.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And those priests are
generally motivated entirely

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.040 align:middle line:90%
by this-world concerns.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And religion then
becomes an instrument

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.670 align:middle line:84%
of material
oppression and control

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.940 align:middle line:84%
and is co-opted by the
political establishment, when,

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.860 align:middle line:84%
in fact, at the
heart of the religion

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.700 align:middle line:84%
is a direct experience
of another world.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>>And those are relegated
by this time to myth.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>Those are relegated to myth.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.549 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, you'll find
that many religions, as they

00:13:55.549 --> 00:13:57.990 align:middle line:84%
develop, turn against
the notion that those

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:59.840 align:middle line:84%
who follow the religion
should experience

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.173 align:middle line:90%
altered states of consciousness.

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:02.982 align:middle line:84%
Many relations are
vehemently opposed

00:14:02.982 --> 00:14:04.440 align:middle line:84%
to altered states
of consciousness,

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.510 align:middle line:84%
even though their own
validity derives originally

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.320 align:middle line:84%
from an altered state
of consciousness.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.750 align:middle line:90%
But this is a normal process.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.130 align:middle line:90%
This is what human beings do.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.530 align:middle line:90%
Human beings are power animals.

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And any structure can
be co-opted to the power

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.474 align:middle line:90%
interests of particular groups.

00:14:19.474 --> 00:14:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's unfortunately what
has happened with religions.

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And the great world religions
today are all, in my view,

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.550 align:middle line:84%
very far removed from
their shamanic roots,

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.780 align:middle line:90%
greatly to their cost.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>>So let's go back to
your personal experience.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.360 align:middle line:84%
What happened when you first had
your experience with ayahuasca?

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I should add that
ayahuasca is not the only

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:42.180 align:middle line:84%
shamanic plant that
I've worked with.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.520 align:middle line:84%
I've also worked with
ibogaine from Central Africa.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.670 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with psilocybin,
sacred mushrooms,

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:50.840 align:middle line:90%
from around the world.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:56.109 align:middle line:84%
And I've worked with DMT in its
pure form, derived from plants.

00:14:56.109 --> 00:14:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>Were there any commonalities
to the experience?

00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:59.850 align:middle line:84%
There were extraordinary
commonalities

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:03.900 align:middle line:84%
to these experiences,
some differences as well.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And what this suggests to me is
that there are multiple realms

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.060 align:middle line:84%
out there and that perhaps
different substances put us

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.750 align:middle line:84%
in tune, put us on to the
right receiver wavelength

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.320 align:middle line:90%
for different realms.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:23.250 align:middle line:84%
But in every case, it is an
absolutely convincing encounter

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.960 align:middle line:90%
with another level of reality.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And this encounter
takes two forms.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.390 align:middle line:84%
For me, if I consider
the ayahuasca experience,

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.830 align:middle line:84%
if we focus in on
that, it was rather

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:37.220 align:middle line:84%
like traveling
for the first time

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.680 align:middle line:84%
to another country, a
wonderful country filled

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.010 align:middle line:84%
with extraordinary
sights and sounds,

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:45.980 align:middle line:84%
filled with beings with
great wisdom and intelligence

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.560 align:middle line:90%
who wish to communicate with me.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.250 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, I had to
learn the rules of that realm.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:52.837 align:middle line:84%
I had to learn it
and discover it

00:15:52.837 --> 00:15:55.170 align:middle line:84%
just as I would have to learn
the rules of a new country

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:56.836 align:middle line:84%
here on earth if I
went to that country.

00:15:56.836 --> 00:15:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>So how did you
experience these new rules?

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.880 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.150 align:middle line:90%
After you'd been throwing up.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:04.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is the problem.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.211 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you have to deal
with the physical consequences

00:16:07.211 --> 00:16:10.375 align:middle line:84%
of ayahuasca and then come
back into the visionary states.

00:16:10.375 --> 00:16:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the
physical consequences

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.240 align:middle line:84%
come back three or four
times during a session.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.150 align:middle line:90%
So it's a constant interruption.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:21.280 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, the
visions always return.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Altogether across
the 11 sessions

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:28.270 align:middle line:84%
that I did in the Amazon, I was
feeling towards the end of it

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:31.310 align:middle line:84%
that I was beginning to
get genuine communication,

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:34.900 align:middle line:84%
that information was coming to
me, that I was understanding.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not that these beings
speak in human voices.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.550 align:middle line:90%
The communication is telepathic.

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:84%
But still, one has to
overcome one's fear, one's

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.760 align:middle line:84%
preconceptions,
one's ideas of what's

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.245 align:middle line:84%
going on in order
to listen to that

00:16:47.245 --> 00:16:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and hear it and understand
what's being said.

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, part of the
ayahuasca experience for me

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.610 align:middle line:84%
was a personal,
inward journey, where

00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:03.210 align:middle line:84%
I found myself confronted with
absolute clarity and no hiding

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:05.859 align:middle line:84%
place with many
things that I had

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.410 align:middle line:84%
done during the
course of my life,

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.290 align:middle line:84%
going right back
to my childhood,

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.900 align:middle line:84%
which I wasn't
proud of and which

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.280 align:middle line:84%
I had kind of shoved
away from memory.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>>Like little life review.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.369 align:middle line:84%
>>It was like a life review,
very much a life review.

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of that
life review-- and I

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.349 align:middle line:84%
know many other people who
have drunk ayahuasca who

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:24.480 align:middle line:90%
have had the same experience.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.210 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of that
life review seems

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.630 align:middle line:84%
to be to allow you
to change track

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.440 align:middle line:84%
if you want to change track,
instead of being just rooted

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.010 align:middle line:84%
in the way that
you've always been.

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:34.460 align:middle line:84%
It gives you a
vision of yourself

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.870 align:middle line:90%
in very unflattering terms.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And you realize your motives
for a certain act of meanness

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.150 align:middle line:90%
or a certain act of dishonesty.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:44.814 align:middle line:84%
And you can't hide
from it anymore.

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And once you realize
that, of course you

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.990 align:middle line:84%
know that you can't go
back and change the past,

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.920 align:middle line:84%
but you also know
that you don't have

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.450 align:middle line:84%
to be that way
again in the future.

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:56.820 align:middle line:84%
So I did find it a profound
teaching experience

00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:01.240 align:middle line:84%
in that respect, just at a
level of personal development.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.720 align:middle line:84%
But at the broader
level, my sense

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.790 align:middle line:84%
is that there is an
enormous amount of extremely

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:10.520 align:middle line:84%
valid and valuable
information that

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.200 align:middle line:84%
was beamed at me
from this other world

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and that I need to
do more work to get

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:17.270 align:middle line:84%
clear exactly what
is being said.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And for that reason, I intend
to persist with ayahuasca.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to go
back to Brazil next year

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.330 align:middle line:84%
and spend a couple of weeks,
again, working with shamans

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:27.150 align:middle line:90%
and drinking ayahuasca.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to explore
that other country further,

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.614 align:middle line:84%
more carefully, over an
extended period of time.

00:18:33.614 --> 00:18:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>>Are you at liberty
to share some

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.290 align:middle line:84%
of what you experience
there that you're

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:38.950 align:middle line:90%
continuing your exploration?

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, as I say, the
experience is primarily

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.930 align:middle line:84%
one of an extraordinary
source of information,

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.780 align:middle line:84%
which can help me
as an individual,

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:51.110 align:middle line:84%
and which may have a much
broader relevance to that,

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:54.920 align:middle line:84%
but which I need to
learn how to decode.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I compare
it with traveling

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:84%
to another country, which
is full of rich experiences,

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.054 align:middle line:84%
but first of all I have
to learn the language

00:19:01.054 --> 00:19:03.460 align:middle line:84%
if I'm going to communicate
with the people there at all.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>So is it given
to you in the form

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:08.400 align:middle line:84%
of, in your personal experience,
more in the form of symbols,

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.280 align:middle line:84%
or, as you say,
these beings that

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.720 align:middle line:90%
morph from animal to human?

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>>Very frequently, I encountered
beings exactly like those

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:17.920 align:middle line:84%
painted on the walls
of the painted caves,

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.700 align:middle line:84%
which are part animal and
part human, one particular--

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>>Like in Egypt.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>>Like in Egypt.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And one particularly
powerful such vision

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.963 align:middle line:84%
involved a creature that
was had the body of a human

00:19:27.963 --> 00:19:30.320 align:middle line:84%
and the head of a
crocodile or an alligator.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And indeed there is an Egyptian
god who looks like that.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.310 align:middle line:84%
I found myself, my
consciousness at any rate,

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:36.800 align:middle line:84%
in a darkened room
of what seemed

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.650 align:middle line:90%
to be some huge building.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:39.936 align:middle line:90%
And there was a doorway.

00:19:39.936 --> 00:19:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And through the doorway,
light was streaming.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And out through the doorway,
I could see a balcony,

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and beyond that, an
enormous expanse of water.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.460 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't clear to me if it
was a sea or a great river.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.184 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that I would
move forward through the room

00:19:53.184 --> 00:19:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and come to that doorway
and see what lay beyond it.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And you can do that
with ayahuasca, you

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.573 align:middle line:84%
can project your consciousness
in the direction that you want.

00:19:59.573 --> 00:20:00.870 align:middle line:90%
So I came to the doorway.

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:02.120 align:middle line:90%
And then I looked to my right.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a huge what I took
to be a statue of a powerfully

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.100 align:middle line:84%
built man with the
head of a crocodile.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.500 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to be carved
out of green jade.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And then just at the moment that
I had decided it was a statute,

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:18.450 align:middle line:84%
the eyes of the figure
swiveled towards me.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And it glanced at me
with a look that I

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:26.370 align:middle line:84%
can describe as sly and
appraising but not threatening.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:29.100 align:middle line:90%
It was reacting to me.

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
I became very afraid.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And the fear caused me to
withdraw from the experience,

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.670 align:middle line:84%
open my eyes, and
shut out the visions.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:41.006 align:middle line:90%
This happened to me a few times.

00:20:41.006 --> 00:20:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
want to go back.

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel I have
to overcome that fear,

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:48.400 align:middle line:84%
that it's very important
to learn to overcome

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.502 align:middle line:84%
fear in order to get the maximum
value out of these experiences.

00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>>And it seems that
a lot of people

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:58.470 align:middle line:84%
encounter this same type of fear
when they have this experience.

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:01.521 align:middle line:84%
And the same types of images
come up, such as the serpent.

00:21:01.521 --> 00:21:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.130 align:middle line:84%
The serpent is absolutely
universal in ayahuasca.

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anybody
who's drunk ayahuasca who

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:09.050 align:middle line:90%
hasn't encountered serpents.

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:11.960 align:middle line:84%
There may be some rare
individuals who haven't.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.460 align:middle line:90%
But the vast majority of us do.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And these serpents
are not-- you know,

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.305 align:middle line:84%
some might argue that we have
a primordial fear of snakes.

00:21:21.305 --> 00:21:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And that that's why in an
altered state of consciousness,

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.180 align:middle line:90%
we see them.

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.600 align:middle line:90%
This is complete nonsense.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:29.570 align:middle line:84%
The serpents that are seen
under the influence of ayahuasca

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:31.620 align:middle line:90%
are not threatening.

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.896 align:middle line:90%
They are not dangerous.

00:21:32.896 --> 00:21:33.770 align:middle line:90%
They are not violent.

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:36.860 align:middle line:84%
They are intelligent beings,
often of enormous scale,

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.210 align:middle line:90%
50 or 100 feet long.

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:40.960 align:middle line:84%
They seem huge,
with gigantic heads

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.370 align:middle line:90%
and bright, intelligent eyes.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And again, they
want to talk to you.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>>Do they have a similar
message or representation

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:48.550 align:middle line:90%
to most people in this state?

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, that varies.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I know one individual, the Swiss
anthropologist Jeremy Narby,

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.230 align:middle line:84%
who went to the Amazon
also to drink ayahuasca,

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:02.020 align:middle line:84%
who felt very much that
he was put in his place

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.830 align:middle line:90%
by two of these serpent beings.

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:06.100 align:middle line:84%
They said to him,
get it straight.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.332 align:middle line:90%
You are just a human being.

00:22:08.332 --> 00:22:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[LAUGHS] Well,
with all of your work

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:14.514 align:middle line:84%
in the past and your
runaway best seller book

00:22:14.514 --> 00:22:16.180 align:middle line:84%
"Fingerprints of the
Gods," where you're

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:21.660 align:middle line:84%
looking at mankind being far
more evolved in times past

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.115 align:middle line:84%
than we have given
us credit for,

00:22:23.115 --> 00:22:27.480 align:middle line:84%
and being able to have overhead
views of the cartography

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:31.440 align:middle line:84%
of the planet, for example,
that were really inexplicable,

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.480 align:middle line:84%
have you found that the
work you're doing now,

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.230 align:middle line:84%
going into these
other dimensions,

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:40.380 align:middle line:84%
is somehow merging
with or validating

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.370 align:middle line:84%
or somehow aligning with the
work you've done previously?

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, definitely.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.710 align:middle line:84%
For example, the ancient
Egyptians and the ancient Maya,

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:50.410 align:middle line:84%
two cultures that I
spent a lot of time

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:52.730 align:middle line:84%
studying over the
last 10 to 15 years,

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:55.400 align:middle line:84%
I've now realized that there was
something about their cultures

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.840 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't understand
and I do understand it now.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.006 align:middle line:84%
And that is that their entire
approach to spirituality

00:23:02.006 --> 00:23:03.700 align:middle line:84%
and to religion
and to the mystery

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.414 align:middle line:84%
of what it is to be
alive was mediated

00:23:06.414 --> 00:23:08.080 align:middle line:84%
through altered states
of consciousness.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Both of these cultures used
altered states of consciousness

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.590 align:middle line:90%
to explore the realms beyond.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:18.565 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that
there are realms beyond

00:23:18.565 --> 00:23:23.700 align:middle line:84%
and that this is why these
experiences are so important.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:24.886 align:middle line:90%
And the shaman are right.

00:23:24.886 --> 00:23:26.760 align:middle line:84%
We mustn't cut ourselves
off from this world.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.022 align:middle line:90%
We have to know about it.

00:23:28.022 --> 00:23:29.980 align:middle line:84%
It's vitally important
for us to know about it.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:33.780 align:middle line:84%
I think it played a huge role
in the incredible success

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:37.330 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Egyptian
civilization, these experiences

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:39.260 align:middle line:84%
and altered states
of consciousness.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.280 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptians
devoted their best minds

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.729 align:middle line:84%
for 3,000 years to exploring the
mystery of life beyond death.

00:23:44.729 --> 00:23:46.520 align:middle line:84%
That's what they were
really interested in,

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.430 align:middle line:90%
what happens to us when we die.

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient Egyptians
had an answer to that.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.763 align:middle line:84%
And that is the answer that
shamans all around the world

00:23:52.763 --> 00:23:56.010 align:middle line:84%
find, that there is a journey
that we must make after death,

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and that in that
journey, we must confront

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:01.170 align:middle line:84%
the consequences of the
lives that we have lived.

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:03.600 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that
these experiences

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.740 align:middle line:84%
that shamans undergo
and that we can undergo

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.241 align:middle line:84%
in altered states
of consciousness--

00:24:07.241 --> 00:24:08.948 align:middle line:84%
that any human being,
it's our birthright

00:24:08.948 --> 00:24:10.730 align:middle line:84%
to undergo these
experiences-- may

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:15.140 align:middle line:84%
be a vital preparation for what
happens to us beyond death,

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:18.310 align:middle line:84%
that we may be able to
orient and prepare ourselves

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:84%
for that transition
and that we may

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:22.320 align:middle line:90%
be able to do so in this life.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>And in the interim, you made a
comment at the end of your talk

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:29.680 align:middle line:84%
today about-- it was, we need
to take our consciousness back

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.280 align:middle line:90%
into our own hands.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I do feel very, very
strongly that we do.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>>It's been co-opted by the
media and by everything else.

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, yes.

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:41.740 align:middle line:84%
First of all, on the input
side, Western civilization

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.160 align:middle line:84%
has taken control of the
consciousness of billions

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.520 align:middle line:84%
of people through the
medium of television,

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.130 align:middle line:84%
projecting the ethic
of Western culture.

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:54.120 align:middle line:84%
The consumerist, materialist
ethic is beamed at us 24 hours

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.900 align:middle line:90%
a day on our TV channels.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, on the other
side, Western culture

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:02.292 align:middle line:84%
has criminalized and
demonized all experiences

00:25:02.292 --> 00:25:04.000 align:middle line:84%
involving altered
states of consciousness

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.262 align:middle line:84%
and any substances that put
us into an altered state

00:25:06.262 --> 00:25:06.970 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is clearly a war over
consciousness that's going on.

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:12.030 align:middle line:84%
It's clear that
our societies have

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:16.405 align:middle line:84%
an investment in preventing
us from exploring where

00:25:16.405 --> 00:25:18.280 align:middle line:84%
altered states of
consciousness will lead us.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps there's a
deep fear that if we

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:22.031 align:middle line:84%
do explore those altered
states of consciousness,

00:25:22.031 --> 00:25:23.980 align:middle line:84%
we will not accept
the power structures

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:29.230 align:middle line:84%
and the fairytale illusion
of material wealth

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:32.440 align:middle line:84%
that we're all brought up
to pursue as though that's

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.760 align:middle line:90%
the only thing to existence.

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that the ancient
Egyptians and other cultures

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.170 align:middle line:90%
like that were right.

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Suppose they were right, that
it's really vital, absolutely

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:46.300 align:middle line:84%
vital, for us and for
our eternal destiny, what

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.690 align:middle line:90%
we do in this life.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And then consider
the predicament

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:52.160 align:middle line:84%
of billions of highly
intelligent people

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.560 align:middle line:84%
who are lulled into
a state of sleep

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:58.550 align:middle line:84%
by this consciousness bomb of
television, which is constantly

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:00.490 align:middle line:84%
being beamed at
them and who are not

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:04.600 align:middle line:84%
allowed to explore the mysteries
of their own consciousness

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.280 align:middle line:84%
using the techniques of shamans
that shamans have developed

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.600 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of years using
the plant hallucinogens.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.320 align:middle line:84%
We are simply not
allowed to do that.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And if we do that, then we are
considered to be criminals.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And we are stigmatized
by our society.

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:90%
And we are put in prison.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.190 align:middle line:84%
This is a reversion to the world
of the Spanish Inquisition.

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:24.960 align:middle line:84%
If I, as an individual, am
not sovereign over my own

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.230 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, if I cannot
decide what to do with

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:29.750 align:middle line:84%
my consciousness, which
is the heart of my being,

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.100 align:middle line:90%
then I am not free.

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And I need not talk
about freedom or living

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:36.370 align:middle line:84%
in a free society or
such issues as democracy

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:38.940 align:middle line:84%
if my society will not
allow me to explore

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:39.815 align:middle line:90%
my own consciousness.

00:26:39.815 --> 00:26:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And that is the problem
that we live in today,

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:46.059 align:middle line:84%
that our societies hate
the idea of exploring

00:26:46.059 --> 00:26:48.600 align:middle line:84%
altered states of consciousness
and use every power structure

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.440 align:middle line:84%
that they have to prevent
that from happening.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.030 align:middle line:84%
If, in an altered
state of consciousness,

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:58.900 align:middle line:84%
my behavior is disruptive
in the public arena,

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.520 align:middle line:84%
then that behavior
should rightly

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.370 align:middle line:90%
be controlled by society.

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:04.360 align:middle line:84%
But a personal and
private exploration

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.960 align:middle line:84%
of our own consciousness is
our own business, in my view,

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.946 align:middle line:84%
and is not the
business of the state.

00:27:09.946 --> 00:27:13.260 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>Graham's work in this field
of altered consciousness

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.820 align:middle line:84%
is chronicled in his book
"Supernatural, Meetings

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.510 align:middle line:84%
with the Ancient
Teachers of Mankind."

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Another of our speakers,
Dr. Stanislav Grof,

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.160 align:middle line:84%
also experienced altered
states of consciousness

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:31.060 align:middle line:84%
through LSD in his medical
training five decades ago.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.110 align:middle line:84%
He was ultimately
led to his insights

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:34.600 align:middle line:90%
on holotropic breathwork.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.300 align:middle line:84%
I think you'll find his
story fascinating as well.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.135 align:middle line:84%
Until next time,
thanks for watching.

00:27:40.135 --> 00:27:55.456 align:middle line:90%
