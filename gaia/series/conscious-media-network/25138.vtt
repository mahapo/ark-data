00:00:03.842 --> 00:00:20.583 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Every time I hear the stock
market summary at the end

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.800 align:middle line:90%
of the day, I chuckle to myself.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.210 align:middle line:84%
From my point of
view, the market

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.580 align:middle line:84%
is no more real than
a desert mirage,

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.310 align:middle line:84%
yet it appears to many people
to be the primary indicator

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.990 align:middle line:90%
of economic well-being.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Not for Pravir Malik, author of
"Redesigning the Stock Market."

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Pravir, president
of a company that

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.630 align:middle line:84%
specializes in helping
organizations minimize

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.540 align:middle line:84%
the negative impact that
stress has on productivity

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.510 align:middle line:84%
and performance, he has
extended that analysis

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.800 align:middle line:90%
to the stock market.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.890 align:middle line:84%
A deeply spiritual
man as well, Pravir

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.970 align:middle line:84%
has spent great deals
of time contemplating

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.580 align:middle line:84%
what it would take to bring
some healthy reality back

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.970 align:middle line:90%
into the stock market.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.300 align:middle line:84%
But first, he
researched exhaustively

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.690 align:middle line:84%
into how the market has
descended into a shadow of what

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:90%
it once was.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.550 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for writing the book.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.090 align:middle line:84%
First of all, what a feat,
"Redesigning the Stock Market."

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.930 align:middle line:84%
It is-- while reading
it, I mean, we're struck,

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.360 align:middle line:84%
first of all, with possibilities
because you paint this

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.270 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, Utopian
picture of what life--

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.300 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion-- will
soon be like, actually.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And then we go into the reality
of how money and commerce moves

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.670 align:middle line:84%
around the planet
and the markets that

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.000 align:middle line:84%
drive it and the dysfunction
and ultimately, the healing.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's the journey this
conversation will go on.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.690 align:middle line:84%
First of all, before we get
into the explanation of some

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.850 align:middle line:84%
of the fractal aspects of this,
when you look at the market

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.780 align:middle line:84%
today, as it stands here,
in the beginning of 2012,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.310 align:middle line:84%
is there any way this market
can sustain itself well

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.380 align:middle line:90%
into the future?

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely not.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.620 align:middle line:84%
There's-- the volume of
trade that's happening,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.660 align:middle line:90%
the reach of--

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.410 align:middle line:84%
the way that the whole market
is now connected globally.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
it's not really

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.150 align:middle line:84%
driven by any kind of
sensible intelligence

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:84%
really means that it is
completely unsustainable.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Because in many respects,
what we're doing is

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.620 align:middle line:84%
we're destroying--
through these trades that

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.290 align:middle line:84%
are happening on a
daily basis, we're

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.290 align:middle line:84%
destroying the very basis on
which all life, all business

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.730 align:middle line:90%
depends on.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And so the market
as it exists is

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:84%
like this machinery that's
off in a different direction

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.630 align:middle line:84%
than what is really needed
for sustainable existence.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.660 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:90%
I mean, certainly, just--

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.030 align:middle line:90%
we can feel that.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.540 align:middle line:90%
And we can read headlines.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And in the past, there
were certain indicators,

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.970 align:middle line:84%
such as if the market
went down, gold went up,

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.850 align:middle line:84%
and these kinds of common
thoughts of the past.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.040 align:middle line:84%
These common
patterns of the past.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.960 align:middle line:90%
But all those patterns are gone.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.350 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really matter
what you choose to invest in,

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.060 align:middle line:90%
there's no sanity.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.920 align:middle line:84%
There's no way to
intelligently assess

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.390 align:middle line:84%
whether this is a good thing
to put your money in anymore.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, it's as
though, like you said,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.810 align:middle line:90%
a machine has taken over.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.740 align:middle line:84%
A machine run by
30-year-old males

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.620 align:middle line:84%
who are behind the
wheel of a red Ferrari

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:84%
and just going at
breakneck speed.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.157 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, yes.

00:03:28.157 --> 00:03:29.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And this didn't
happen overnight, though.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And what I would like to
do is get into a little bit

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.960 align:middle line:84%
of the history, the
key points in history,

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.279 align:middle line:84%
as were outlined by a financial
analyst named John Authers.

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:44.570 align:middle line:90%
I think that's his name, right?

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Get into some of the
timelines of what happened,

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.480 align:middle line:84%
starting from the
beginning of stock markets.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.380 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to go back to the
16th century or 17th century,

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.880 align:middle line:90%
forward to this point.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.480 align:middle line:84%
So let's see what happened
to destabilize things

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.000 align:middle line:84%
that before we start getting
into this fractal view

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.040 align:middle line:84%
and the healing view
and the possible even

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.510 align:middle line:90%
Utopian view down the road.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with the
origins of the stock market.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.050 align:middle line:84%
So back in the 1600s
is perhaps the time

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.190 align:middle line:84%
where you had the stock market
really coming into existence.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was driven by, if
you will, the Dutch people

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.200 align:middle line:84%
wanting to establish trade
routes between Europe

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.150 align:middle line:90%
and the Far East.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And what they needed
to do was build up

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.950 align:middle line:84%
a huge amount of capital so
that they could, in a sense,

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.670 align:middle line:84%
build a Navy, build factories
for garments that could then

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:49.130 align:middle line:84%
be traded with the Far East so
that spices could be bought in,

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.680 align:middle line:84%
and other goods that Europeans
found attractive at that time.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:03.280 align:middle line:10%
And so what they did was,
in a sense, they opened a--

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.370 align:middle line:10%
they had people from all
over the Dutch regions

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.940 align:middle line:10%
really invest.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.820 align:middle line:90%
And so they raised 6.4 or 6.5--

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.050 align:middle line:90%
over 6 million guilders--

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Which was a lot.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:17.850 align:middle line:90%
>> At the time was huge.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was huge.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And with that money, they did
exactly what they wanted to,

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:31.380 align:middle line:84%
which was they built a
Navy, they built factories.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.310 align:middle line:84%
They built the capability to
establish these trade routes.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And all this was supposed
to be in existence

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.990 align:middle line:90%
only for a set number of years.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.380 align:middle line:84%
So when this charter for this
company that was being funded

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.010 align:middle line:84%
was created, it was
supposed to exist for--

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.560 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember the
exact number of years,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.140 align:middle line:90%
but it was for a finite period.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:06:00.050 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was that as
the success of this venture

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.630 align:middle line:84%
continued, I think
the incentive,

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.900 align:middle line:84%
the financial incentive, proved
to be pretty overwhelming.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:12.410 align:middle line:10%
And shareholders who initially
had been given the promise that

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.090 align:middle line:10%
they would be able to exit
over this set number of years,

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.890 align:middle line:10%
then couldn't.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.940 align:middle line:10%
And as a result, the shares that
they had needed to be traded,

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.060 align:middle line:10%
and that really was the start of
the stock market, if you will.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.580 align:middle line:84%
The active start of
it, in that the shares

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.870 align:middle line:90%
needed to be actively traded.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And so this was about in
the first or second decade

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.820 align:middle line:84%
of 1600's so maybe
around 1614 or so.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And at that time, they also--
they were already developing

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.810 align:middle line:84%
pretty sophisticated
tools within it,

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.260 align:middle line:90%
such as short selling.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, we'd look at it
now, and people say, oh,

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.520 align:middle line:90%
it should be illegal.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.970 align:middle line:84%
They're manipulating
not just metals markets,

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.367 align:middle line:84%
but all kinds of markets on
short selling, which seems

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:50.450 align:middle line:90%
like really dirty dealing.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.610 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying
in the book, here,

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.986 align:middle line:90%
this was going on even then.

00:06:53.986 --> 00:06:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's right.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.310 align:middle line:84%
So I think that there are a
number of financial products

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.420 align:middle line:84%
that we see now that we have
not been able to regulate away

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.790 align:middle line:90%
that existed back then as well.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And that, very much, I
think, as we discuss further,

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.260 align:middle line:84%
it's this whole
fractal effect that

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.240 align:middle line:90%
continues to repeat itself.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And the very fact that
if we look at what

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.600 align:middle line:84%
had driven the creation of the
stock market to begin with,

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.670 align:middle line:90%
and then its continuation.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And the most profitable
aspect of the company

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.360 align:middle line:84%
that was created
at that time was

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.720 align:middle line:84%
due to overpowering,
say, the other ships that

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.960 align:middle line:84%
belonged to the
Portuguese or the Spanish

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.390 align:middle line:84%
and appropriating the materials
from there for the funds.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And so you see this
incredible aggression

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.330 align:middle line:84%
that existed way back
then that it defines

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.500 align:middle line:84%
the seat of the stock
market, if you will,

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.240 align:middle line:84%
or the seat of commerce that has
been in existence since then.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>> And which is greed.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is greed, yes.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a very
interesting dynamic.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.740 align:middle line:84%
So there's greed that
continues, and it keeps--

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.140 align:middle line:84%
greed will keep
driving how decisions

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:13.640 align:middle line:84%
are made, until some
point where fear kicks in,

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and then there is a crash that
occurs when the fear kicks in.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And then when the reasons for
the fear have been overcome,

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.960 align:middle line:90%
then greed takes back up.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.890 align:middle line:90%
So you begin to see--

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>> The Elliott
Wave as an example.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.933 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think you
write in the book

00:08:25.933 --> 00:08:28.790 align:middle line:84%
that for this phase of
our spiritual, emotional

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:32.000 align:middle line:84%
development as a species, which
the stock market is reflecting,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.890 align:middle line:84%
what we'll talk about
in the little bit,

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.570 align:middle line:84%
that the Elliott Wave is one
of the most accurate types

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:43.354 align:middle line:84%
of indicators, because it is
dealing with these raw emotions

00:08:43.354 --> 00:08:44.270 align:middle line:90%
that we swing through.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And people can feel it
on a personal basis.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.203 align:middle line:90%
People that play the market.

00:08:48.203 --> 00:08:49.003 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:49.003 --> 00:08:49.950 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a macro and micro
dynamic of greed, fear, greed,

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.380 align:middle line:90%
fear.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.720 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have a little
rest in between, maybe,

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.210 align:middle line:84%
for a moment or
two, of equilibrium.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you're talking about
this, we're looking at--

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.690 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have the stats
written in front of me--

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:07.970 align:middle line:90%
up to 1950 or so.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So the stock market
continued developing

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.630 align:middle line:84%
throughout the world,
and ultimately, we

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.370 align:middle line:90%
come into more modern times now.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And we'll start isolating now
on the 20th century, where

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.120 align:middle line:84%
I think the stats
were something-- set

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.940 align:middle line:84%
something in the
1950s, where it took

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.790 align:middle line:84%
that long a period of time,
these hundreds of years,

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:29.420 align:middle line:84%
to get to a certain
threshold of volume.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:32.870 align:middle line:90%
And then it leapt to the 1990s.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:36.320 align:middle line:90%
And from the 1990s to--

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.180 align:middle line:90%
from 2000, in fact, to 2006.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.770 align:middle line:90%
I do have stats.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:42.320 align:middle line:10%
The market went
from $55 trillion

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:47.360 align:middle line:10%
global trading. $55 trillion
worth of trading in 2000

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.040 align:middle line:10%
to $120 trillion in 2006.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.120 align:middle line:90%
So what has happened here?

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.960 align:middle line:10%
So I think that there's a
number of things that happened,

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.360 align:middle line:10%
and a fair amount these
have been called out

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.980 align:middle line:10%
by John Authers in his book,
"The Fearful Rise of Markets."

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:13.400 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, the last
great stock market crash

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.420 align:middle line:84%
that had occurred before
1950's was in 1929.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And following that there
was some legislation that

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.190 align:middle line:84%
was put in place, the
Glass-Steagall Act of 1932,

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:27.050 align:middle line:90%
1933.

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And in that there was a
separation of commercial banks

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.870 align:middle line:84%
and investment banks so
that the capital that

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:40.070 align:middle line:84%
was being loaned to
hardworking people

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:46.820 align:middle line:84%
could not then be used to invest
in these elaborate, fanciful

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.420 align:middle line:84%
schemes that investment
banks might indulge in.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Which led to
the crash of '29?

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.430 align:middle line:84%
That was definitely part
of the problem, which

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:58.100 align:middle line:84%
was there was a lot of
financial innovation

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.970 align:middle line:90%
that had taken place.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Much like today,
where you have all

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.510 align:middle line:84%
the different
financial innovation

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.840 align:middle line:90%
that's been taking place.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And then in addition,
there was also,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.130 align:middle line:84%
as is now or prior to our
current financial crises,

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:15.150 align:middle line:84%
back then also there was this
level of irrational exuberance

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.820 align:middle line:84%
on the part of
consumers, investors,

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.710 align:middle line:84%
and that led to the
crash, essentially.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
legislation that

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.850 align:middle line:84%
was put in place to reverse
some of the effects of that.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.510 align:middle line:10%
And so we continued
on for a few decades,

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:34.050 align:middle line:10%
until about 1950, where this
legislation was followed.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And one of the key
legislations also

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:42.000 align:middle line:84%
was that commercial banks had to
have a high deposit insurance.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that their
level of trying

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.770 align:middle line:84%
to get into very
risky areas would then

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:49.410 align:middle line:90%
be minimized because of that.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:55.410 align:middle line:84%
But however, starting in
about late 1950s, early 1960s,

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:57.300 align:middle line:84%
a number of things
happened that began

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.520 align:middle line:84%
to reverse all the
safeguards that

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.280 align:middle line:84%
had been put in place
from the previous crises.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at it then,
roughly in about-- in 1960s,

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.440 align:middle line:90%
two things happened.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.930 align:middle line:84%
First, we saw the
emergence of a market fund.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:16.710 align:middle line:10%
And why that's significant
is because all year round,

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:20.010 align:middle line:10%
investments had
been taking place

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.530 align:middle line:10%
because individuals were
investing their own money,

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.140 align:middle line:10%
so there was a much higher
degree of due diligence.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.720 align:middle line:10%
There was a lot more
thinking about what's

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.250 align:middle line:10%
the risk if I lose this money.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:32.390 align:middle line:10%
And so things were invested
where probably there

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.900 align:middle line:10%
were safe returns
and where there

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.990 align:middle line:10%
was some useful
development taking place.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.840 align:middle line:10%
But then with the emergence
of this market fund,

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.350 align:middle line:10%
it was now all these
investments from individuals

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:46.800 align:middle line:10%
were pulled together
by a market manager.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.140 align:middle line:10%
And so it was other people's
money that was at risk.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.970 align:middle line:10%
And so the fund manager didn't
have the same kind of skin

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.620 align:middle line:10%
in the game, if you will.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.350 align:middle line:10%
And plus, the way that the
market funds were incented

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:03.330 align:middle line:10%
were completely driven
by going for volume

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.540 align:middle line:10%
of assets that a
fund controlled,

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.210 align:middle line:10%
rather than quality
of investments.

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And so that was one big shift
that took place in the 1960s.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
thing was that there

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:18.480 align:middle line:84%
was the emergence of
the money market funds

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:24.210 align:middle line:84%
as well, which made these
investment banks take away

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:26.980 align:middle line:84%
some of the core activities
of commercial banks.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.010 align:middle line:10%
The commercial banks
had an incentive

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:10%
to operate more safely,
but investment banks

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.070 align:middle line:10%
didn't have the same
kind of stipulations

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.560 align:middle line:10%
as the commercial
banks, but now could

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.380 align:middle line:10%
operate doing the same thing
that commercial banks are

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.580 align:middle line:10%
doing in a much more risky way.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.300 align:middle line:10%
So you begin to see the
controls being taken away

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:49.650 align:middle line:10%
and the sanity that existed
falling away quickly.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And then in the 1970s,
there was a huge shift.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Early 1970s, '71,
where we departed

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:57.810 align:middle line:90%
from the gold standard.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.757 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of a
linchpin, if you will,

00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:90%
in this whole thing.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:84%
Because gold, if
we think about it,

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:09.571 align:middle line:84%
it's a finite product that
you can see very clearly.

00:14:09.571 --> 00:14:11.070 align:middle line:84%
In all of history,
there is supposed

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:15.930 align:middle line:84%
to have been only 20 cubic
meters that had been mined.

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of
money that a nation,

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:23.070 align:middle line:84%
that any individual nation
could put into the market

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.710 align:middle line:84%
was related to the amount of
gold that they actually had.

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:27.780 align:middle line:90%
So it is a very tight system.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And so as a result of
being a tight system,

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.960 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't have things like
runaway inflation occurring.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.770 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't have the money
supply going out of control.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:41.340 align:middle line:10%
But all that was taken away when
the gold standard was exited.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.540 align:middle line:10%
And then also when the
gold standard was exited,

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.560 align:middle line:10%
essentially, gold was
pegged to the US dollar.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:55.265 align:middle line:84%
So for example, one ounce of
gold was worth $35 at the time.

00:14:55.265 --> 00:14:56.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:56.065 --> 00:14:59.050 align:middle line:90%
And today, and $1,700 roughly.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:14:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:01.670 align:middle line:90%
It's completely out of control.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:05.670 align:middle line:84%
But essentially what
happened then was that all

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.130 align:middle line:84%
the different-- when the gold
standard was exited, then

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.680 align:middle line:84%
all the reserves of dollars
that different countries

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.710 align:middle line:84%
around the world had
lost their value.

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:16.440 align:middle line:90%
Because the gold began to rise--

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.410 align:middle line:84%
the value of gold went
up from $35 to a lot more

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.870 align:middle line:90%
when you exited the standard.

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And in effect, another big
shift that happened at that time

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:28.200 align:middle line:90%
was the oil--

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.000 align:middle line:90%
OPEC.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.610 align:middle line:10%
The Oil Petroleum
Exporting Community.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:39.752 align:middle line:10%
They realized that they needed
to shift away from this--

00:15:39.752 --> 00:15:41.460 align:middle line:10%
they needed to create
a new standard now.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:46.700 align:middle line:84%
So they hiked up the price
of oil substantially.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Which was the new gold.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:48.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Which was the new gold.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:49.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:49.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:49.770 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>> The Petrodollar.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened,
that began to then

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.400 align:middle line:84%
have its repercussions
in that there

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.450 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of inflation
that created in the US

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and globally because
of the divergence

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:09.350 align:middle line:84%
of different global
currencies from the dollar.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:12.400 align:middle line:84%
You begin to have
a lot of variation

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.910 align:middle line:84%
in the way that
money that was drawn

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.390 align:middle line:90%
at the level of each country.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:22.640 align:middle line:84%
There was inflation that began
to occur all over the world.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think those
few shifts meant

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:30.290 align:middle line:84%
that 1973, 1974, because
of the uncertainty, we

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:38.540 align:middle line:84%
entered into a huge bear market,
the 1973-74 bear market, which

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.150 align:middle line:84%
it occurs because
of this shift away

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:42.960 align:middle line:84%
from the gold standard
to the oil standard.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And so at this time, we're in
the markets where John or Jane

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Doe would say, I want to invest
in, say, an auto manufacturer.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.680 align:middle line:90%
One of the blue chip stocks.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Something where
you knew that cars

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.410 align:middle line:84%
were going to be in
demand at a certain rate.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:02.360 align:middle line:90%
It was a safe investment.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.430 align:middle line:84%
It was an intelligent,
logical investment

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:05.540 align:middle line:90%
from their perspective.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.940 align:middle line:84%
They studied it and looked
at the profits and losses.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.420 align:middle line:84%
So now that goes with the
money market funds come in.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.490 align:middle line:84%
When we detach from
gold, then, we're

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:18.410 align:middle line:84%
going into the instability
of an oil-based environment

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:20.225 align:middle line:84%
economically, which
then is bringing,

00:17:20.225 --> 00:17:23.625 align:middle line:84%
now, all of these weird
political instabilities, right?

00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:24.425 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

00:17:24.425 --> 00:17:25.225 align:middle line:90%
>> Globally.

00:17:25.225 --> 00:17:27.500 align:middle line:84%
So that brings even
more instability in.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Inflation takes hold
all around the world.

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And now we're setting the
stage for what happens then

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.650 align:middle line:90%
in the 1980s.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:40.640 align:middle line:84%
So the manifest sign that
things have really shifted

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.382 align:middle line:90%
occurs in 1987.

00:17:42.382 --> 00:17:44.840 align:middle line:84%
But there's, again, a few shifts
that happened before that.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.270 align:middle line:10%
So the manifest
sign, in 1987, you

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.770 align:middle line:10%
have a synchronized
global crash.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:53.120 align:middle line:10%
And this is the first time that
stock markets around the world

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:58.190 align:middle line:10%
drop in tremendous value in
a short time simultaneously.

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And that means that
the notion of value

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:01.850 align:middle line:90%
has completely shifted now.

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:05.300 align:middle line:10%
Because earlier,
whereas say, investing

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.300 align:middle line:10%
in a country like Brazil
or India or the US

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:13.940 align:middle line:10%
meant something different, in
that your development in the US

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.961 align:middle line:10%
was completely different
from development in, say,

00:18:17.961 --> 00:18:19.835 align:middle line:10%
a developing country
like India [INAUDIBLE]..

00:18:19.835 --> 00:18:20.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:20.635 --> 00:18:22.560 align:middle line:84%
The emerging markets
started coming into play.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Which aren't those just
ripe for political and other

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:25.649 align:middle line:90%
exploitation?

00:18:25.649 --> 00:18:27.065 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to be
totally manipulated?

00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:28.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And there's-- I know you've met
and interviewed John Perkins.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes,

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And his book, "Confessions
of an Economic Hit Man"

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.430 align:middle line:90%
really cover that very well.

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:44.750 align:middle line:10%
But then in addition to that,
what begins to happen in 1982,

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:49.010 align:middle line:10%
you see the emergence of the
emerging market fund, which

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:52.190 align:middle line:10%
means that not only
are, in a certain sense,

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:54.890 align:middle line:10%
countries becoming part
of this, quote unquote,

00:18:54.890 --> 00:19:00.440 align:middle line:10%
"secret" empire of,
say, United States,

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.020 align:middle line:10%
but now what's happening is
because of the emerging market

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.710 align:middle line:10%
fund, you have a
large number of--

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:09.260 align:middle line:10%
you have a lot
more money that can

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:15.710 align:middle line:10%
be handled by any company in the
emerging markets suddenly being

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:18.950 align:middle line:10%
thrust upon those emerging
markets at the corporate level.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's always tied to their
raw resources at some level.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:25.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.091 align:middle line:84%
>> And there are some moral,
ethical issues we could go

00:19:28.091 --> 00:19:30.140 align:middle line:84%
into at length
just on that alone.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:32.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Because the fact is that the
way that this money comes in,

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:45.140 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of inflation that
takes place in that country.

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And then very often,
the corporations who are

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.650 align:middle line:84%
a recipient of the funds cannot
make payments, and so on.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:56.489 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
lot of, as you say,

00:19:56.489 --> 00:19:58.530 align:middle line:84%
there's moral and ethical
issues in terms of what

00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.950 align:middle line:90%
they need to do to pay it back.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:02.241 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and whether or not
the people even have access

00:20:02.241 --> 00:20:05.000 align:middle line:84%
to their own resources
anymore oftentimes, right?

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Because those are now held
in global corporate hands.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.020 align:middle line:84%
So OK, so now we've got
the emerging markets

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.900 align:middle line:84%
coming in and destabilizing
the emerging economies

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.550 align:middle line:84%
of the world,
after we've already

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:21.300 align:middle line:84%
destabilized all of the
first-world economies,

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.700 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:23.630 align:middle line:90%
So then what happens?

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:26.737 align:middle line:90%
We go into the 1990s, and then--

00:20:26.737 --> 00:20:28.070 align:middle line:90%
well, we've got junk bonds and--

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Junk bonds.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>> --Michael Milken.

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:34.620 align:middle line:84%
In 1984, you have
two things happening.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:40.070 align:middle line:10%
One is that you've got the
mortgage-backed bonds that have

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:44.520 align:middle line:10%
now been legitimized,
and that's a very--

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.810 align:middle line:10%
again, a very tricky
issue, and the center

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:52.040 align:middle line:10%
of a lot of toxic assets
that have been responsible

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.810 align:middle line:10%
for even today, the
global financial crises.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:59.380 align:middle line:10%
So one can see that that
mainstream, toxic asset

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.120 align:middle line:10%
mentality was started
at that point,

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.840 align:middle line:10%
around 1984, when
mortgage-backed bonds were

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.220 align:middle line:10%
legitimized.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:10.870 align:middle line:10%
And again, the psychology
is that you're moving away

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:14.200 align:middle line:10%
from that safe investment
that a bank makes

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.230 align:middle line:10%
to an individual
homeowner, and here you're

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:20.280 align:middle line:10%
beginning to set the
stage for pooling together

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.410 align:middle line:10%
a bunch of mortgages
into special purpose

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:10%
vehicles that
investment banks set up,

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:10%
and then that becomes
the basis for all kinds

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.430 align:middle line:10%
of other financial
products that really

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:33.130 align:middle line:10%
have no basis in reality.

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.340 align:middle line:90%
>> And then foreign exchange.

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Now we bring foreign
currencies into it.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.900 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of the bedrock
of each of the countries.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, a means
of doing commerce.

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:46.300 align:middle line:84%
In 1992, there was
the Black Wednesday.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:51.100 align:middle line:84%
So when George Soros really
made the Bank of England crash,

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.240 align:middle line:84%
because he bought
a huge number of--

00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:01.330 align:middle line:84%
he essentially exchanged pounds
for Deutsche marks, $10 billion

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:02.950 align:middle line:90%
in US dollars.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.507 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, the pound
dropped in tremendous value,

00:22:06.507 --> 00:22:08.590 align:middle line:84%
and then he bought them
back at the end of the day

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.470 align:middle line:90%
at a profit of $1 billion US.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And that started this whole
foreign exchange capital

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:17.200 align:middle line:90%
or asset class, if you will.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And to your point,
yes, absolutely.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:24.790 align:middle line:84%
It just takes away that
freedom or that sense

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:26.680 align:middle line:90%
that each country has of--

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Sovereignty over
their currency.

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Sovereignty, yes.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:28.970 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>> The value of
their own currency.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.160 align:middle line:90%
Now that's gone.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.380 align:middle line:90%
That's out the window.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:36.370 align:middle line:84%
This beast is becoming
more bloated by the moment.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And so then we go
into hedge funds.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Which is-- these are
huge-volume funds.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:47.766 align:middle line:84%
And they're usually
very wealthy investors

00:22:47.766 --> 00:22:48.890 align:middle line:90%
who have invested in these.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And the whole purpose
of hedge funds

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:53.980 align:middle line:90%
is to hedge to make profit to--

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.150 align:middle line:90%
so that's the purpose.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And they find small, little gaps
and push the money in there,

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.540 align:middle line:84%
and make a huge
profit very quickly.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.060 align:middle line:90%


00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And it has a huge effect in
terms of the systemic results.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:10.750 align:middle line:84%
So it can really
lopside how markets

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.840 align:middle line:84%
should be functioning, when
you take all that money

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.190 align:middle line:90%
and invest it in a small place.

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, by 2005-- we won't
even get into derivatives,

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.320 align:middle line:84%
because I haven't heard an
intelligent description of what

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.529 align:middle line:90%
a derivative is yet.

00:23:24.529 --> 00:23:26.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've heard
some really good ones.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Top guys on Wall Street,
stumbling on camera.

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:31.080 align:middle line:90%
Uh, Well it's kind of like, uh--

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.770 align:middle line:90%
so we won't go into derivatives.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:35.440 align:middle line:84%
But let's go into the
notion of default risk.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:40.150 align:middle line:84%
It says here, in 2005, default
risk became an asset class.

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:43.480 align:middle line:90%
What exactly does that mean?

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.180 align:middle line:84%
So again, I don't know
a whole lot on that.

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.270 align:middle line:90%
So it's--

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>> It's kind of like
talking about derivatives.

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:52.680 align:middle line:10%
Now we're getting into almost--

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:57.570 align:middle line:10%
is this like, are these
just out and out scams

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:00.720 align:middle line:10%
being embedded in language
that sounds professional,

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.420 align:middle line:10%
at this point?

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.770 align:middle line:10%
These are scams.

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.413 align:middle line:90%
>> Investment scams.

00:24:06.413 --> 00:24:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, so these are all
financial products that have

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:15.270 align:middle line:90%
little basis in ground reality.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, it's all these
bubbles that are being created.

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Because it looks like-- the
perception is that there's

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:28.220 align:middle line:84%
a lot of activity
happening when you say

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.350 align:middle line:84%
the value in a certain
country is going up,

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:35.220 align:middle line:84%
or it's become a
hotspot for investment.

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.020 align:middle line:84%
There is actually--
it's a huge bubble.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Because there's not
any basis for that.

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.520 align:middle line:84%
That country or that
company or that region

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.890 align:middle line:84%
can't absorb that
in a productive way.

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's inevitable that
there's going to be a crash,

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:54.390 align:middle line:84%
and that the assets that
had been used as collateral

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:55.890 align:middle line:84%
are now going to
become free game

00:24:55.890 --> 00:25:00.100 align:middle line:84%
for all kinds of other
financial players and investors.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.860 align:middle line:84%
So yes, in a sense,
it is like a scam.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:03.720 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a scam.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.950 align:middle line:10%
And now we're to the point
where I've read that--

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:10.720 align:middle line:10%
and you can tell me if
you know this to be true--

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.140 align:middle line:10%
that really one of the
ways of making the Dow

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.810 align:middle line:10%
Jones, for example,
in the US markets,

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:18.930 align:middle line:10%
look like it has any value
is by simply removing

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:21.330 align:middle line:10%
the poor players and
substituting them

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:24.600 align:middle line:10%
on a daily or weekly basis
with stronger performers

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.960 align:middle line:10%
and then calling it
the market index, which

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.600 align:middle line:10%
is totally fabricated.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.260 align:middle line:10%
It's a lie.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.260 align:middle line:10%
It has nothing to do to reflect
the actual value of what's

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.345 align:middle line:10%
going on anymore from
what I understand.

00:25:36.345 --> 00:25:37.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet people are all
excited, and NPR, you know?

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's supposedly the bastion
of free news in America.

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:46.870 align:middle line:84%
It reports what's
happening on the Dow,

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and then it has a nice
little sound by someone,

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.910 align:middle line:90%
there's room for optimism now.

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:53.260 align:middle line:84%
It appears our economy
is on the mend.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And you're looking
at 20% unemployment.

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:58.410 align:middle line:90%
So none of this is true anymore.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:00.000 align:middle line:90%
This is a falsehood.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.310 align:middle line:90%
The market is a falsehood.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And the Dow Jones
Industrial Average

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.620 align:middle line:84%
is a price weighted so
there's different indices.

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:10.320 align:middle line:10%
So it's a price
weighted index, which

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:16.070 align:middle line:10%
means that the index
has been created--

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:20.220 align:middle line:10%
there's companies that are
allotted a certain proportion

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.420 align:middle line:10%
in that index based on the
price that they're trading at.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And so a company that is trading
at a higher price automatically

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:31.830 align:middle line:84%
would have more of a
weightage in that index.

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And so just
historically, an index

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:41.040 align:middle line:84%
that's based like that is
going to let the market

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.200 align:middle line:90%
go where it's going.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And what-- if we talk about why
that's a falsehood in a sense,

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:50.340 align:middle line:84%
because you're
not really tapping

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:55.190 align:middle line:84%
into the fundamental value that
companies are creating or not.

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:57.840 align:middle line:84%
With price weighted
index, you're being driven

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.425 align:middle line:90%
by the stock price that's--

00:26:59.425 --> 00:27:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>> That has nothing to do with
real value anyway anymore.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>> It has nothing to do
with real value, right.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:03.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:04.560 align:middle line:90%
So OK.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.030 align:middle line:84%
So I think we've
gotten the point across

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:09.870 align:middle line:84%
that I said earlier, this
is kind of a bloated beast.

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:10.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a falsehood.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.360 align:middle line:90%
The market is a falsehood.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.744 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot of people
who used to invest in it,

00:27:14.744 --> 00:27:16.410 align:middle line:84%
they simply stopped
because there wasn't

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:18.360 align:middle line:90%
anything making sense anymore.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Yet it continues
on, and it makes

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:24.900 align:middle line:84%
the headline news every day,
and it's just a charade.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And now I'd like to
now back off from that.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:30.630 align:middle line:84%
We get an idea of what's
happened and how we got here.

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And you're looking
at the markets

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.730 align:middle line:84%
now through this
fractal approach which

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.900 align:middle line:84%
has to do with three
phases of development;

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.610 align:middle line:84%
the physical, the
vital, and the mental.

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And this has really
deeply rooted, sane,

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:50.070 align:middle line:84%
spiritual principles
behind it as well.

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us a
brief description

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.220 align:middle line:84%
of the physical phase, the vital
phase, and the mental phase

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and examples of
what that would look

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.100 align:middle line:90%
like in a market structure?

00:27:59.100 --> 00:27:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:06.400 align:middle line:10%
So the simplest way
that I can describe it

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.400 align:middle line:10%
is by thinking about a
journey that a seed makes

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.974 align:middle line:10%
in becoming a flower.

00:28:11.974 --> 00:28:13.390 align:middle line:10%
So if we think
about that, there's

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:16.399 align:middle line:10%
three stages of
development; there's a seed,

00:28:16.399 --> 00:28:18.190 align:middle line:10%
there's the stalk,
which is a middle stage,

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:20.890 align:middle line:10%
and then there's a flower,
which is the culmination.

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:22.600 align:middle line:84%
So the seed, if we
look at the seed,

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:29.380 align:middle line:84%
it's really a finite, closed
entity that apparently

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.690 align:middle line:90%
has very little activity.

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:35.824 align:middle line:84%
It maintains its status
quo until it's germinated.

00:28:35.824 --> 00:28:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And so when we think
about the physical,

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:39.730 align:middle line:84%
it's this impulse to
keep things as they

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:45.310 align:middle line:84%
are, much like the seed, so we
remain at a status quo level,

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:47.667 align:middle line:84%
keep the rules that had
been operating in the past.

00:28:47.667 --> 00:28:48.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Like the gold standard.

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Like the gold standard.

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:49.830 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.913 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:49.913 --> 00:28:50.080 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.880 align:middle line:90%
So that would be an example of--

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.280 align:middle line:90%
>> The physical.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.185 align:middle line:90%
>> The physical stage.

00:28:53.185 --> 00:28:53.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:53.985 --> 00:28:54.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Very stable.

00:28:54.835 --> 00:28:55.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Very stable.

00:28:55.635 --> 00:28:56.435 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:56.435 --> 00:28:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>> There's not a lot of room
for growth or rapid growth out

00:28:59.060 --> 00:28:59.860 align:middle line:90%
of it, per se.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's right.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.330 align:middle line:84%
The vital stages, like that
stalk in the middle stage,

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:05.475 align:middle line:90%
where there's--

00:29:05.475 --> 00:29:07.600 align:middle line:84%
and the stalk is just
meant to be a metaphor,

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.100 align:middle line:84%
but there's a lot more
assertiveness in that growth.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about
the seed growing,

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:15.280 align:middle line:84%
there is, relatively, a
lot more assertiveness,

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.860 align:middle line:84%
and there's a whole
root structure.

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.120 align:middle line:84%
There's a tendril
structure that's created.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more exchange
with the environment; gases,

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:24.174 align:middle line:90%
nutrients exchanged.

00:29:24.174 --> 00:29:25.465 align:middle line:90%
So there's a lot more activity.

00:29:25.465 --> 00:29:28.390 align:middle line:84%
It may not be ordered activity,
but there is activity,

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:29.380 align:middle line:90%
and it could--

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.200 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of the foundation
of aggressiveness

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and of wanting to
appropriate things for one's

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.340 align:middle line:84%
own small self,
in a certain way.

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>> For its own assurance
of growth and survival.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.910 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:47.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's, I think, the Darwinian
notion of competitiveness.

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And very much, when
we think about markets

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.260 align:middle line:90%
today, it's really about that.

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.130 align:middle line:10%
Each player existing
for its own self

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:57.430 align:middle line:10%
or trying to
appropriate resources

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.880 align:middle line:10%
to aggrandize its own notion
of what it exists for,

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.750 align:middle line:10%
and that's kind of that vital
phase, that middle phase.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And then the mental phase is
where there's a culmination.

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:12.730 align:middle line:84%
So that idea that existed in
a dormant state in the seed

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:16.450 align:middle line:84%
now has a chance to show
itself, and so there

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:18.490 align:middle line:90%
is a uniqueness that comes out.

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:19.290 align:middle line:90%
There's purpose.

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:20.560 align:middle line:90%
There's intent.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:24.370 align:middle line:10%
And that's, I think,
very well captured

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:27.820 align:middle line:10%
by this notion of a flower
that also could be unique.

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.370 align:middle line:10%
It has intent, it has purpose,
it has mystery, it has depth.

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:33.340 align:middle line:10%
>> While still being connected
to its original seed source.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:35.380 align:middle line:90%
While still being connected.

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:36.180 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's the
physical, vital, mental.

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, as you said, if we
think about the market timeline

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:50.380 align:middle line:84%
that we just went through,
then the gold standard

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:54.220 align:middle line:84%
could be the physical is kind
of representative of that.

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:56.080 align:middle line:84%
The oil standard
is representative

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.630 align:middle line:84%
of the vital phase,
and very interestingly,

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:03.040 align:middle line:84%
if we think about what
oil is, it's, in a sense,

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:06.580 align:middle line:84%
these crushed,
pressurized remains

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:11.170 align:middle line:84%
of entities that at one
point existed on the earth.

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:14.530 align:middle line:84%
These plant and animal entities
that, if you look at it,

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:17.500 align:middle line:84%
are physical and vital
in their consciousness.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:22.870 align:middle line:84%
So oil is a great metaphor
for this vital consciousness.

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And the question
is, what's next?

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and it brings with
it also that aggression

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:30.435 align:middle line:84%
and potential chaos and
instability of that phase

00:31:30.435 --> 00:31:31.235 align:middle line:90%
of growth.

00:31:31.235 --> 00:31:32.035 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:31:32.035 --> 00:31:32.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>> And so next?

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what's next,
that's this notion of another

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:40.470 align:middle line:90%
standard.

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And in the book,
what I talk about,

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:47.410 align:middle line:84%
potentially, is perhaps
a solar standard, but--

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Solar.

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>> A solar standard.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:54.160 align:middle line:84%
But the real-- the point
being is that this is not--

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:58.150 align:middle line:84%
solar energy is
existing everywhere.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:01.231 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that
you capture and put,

00:32:01.231 --> 00:32:02.105 align:middle line:90%
and that you control.

00:32:02.105 --> 00:32:02.938 align:middle line:90%
>> You can't own it.

00:32:02.938 --> 00:32:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's available
to everybody.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:11.300 align:middle line:84%
It exists in the different
kinds of services

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.510 align:middle line:90%
that nature provides around us.

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:16.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they all have solar
energy embedded in them.

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Even if we think
about plants, they've

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:22.060 align:middle line:84%
come into being because of
the way that they've converted

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.910 align:middle line:90%
solar energy to something else.

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And so here what we're saying
is that there is essentially

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.889 align:middle line:90%
a kind of a--

00:32:29.889 --> 00:32:31.430 align:middle line:84%
if we think about
it in market terms,

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:34.570 align:middle line:84%
there needs to be a
democratization of markets.

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And that solar standard is the
metaphor for that, if you will.

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And something that links
back to something of true value.

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Of true value.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:42.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Where the assets
of true value,

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.180 align:middle line:84%
resources or whatever
of true value.

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:51.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And so we're a
long way from there.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:54.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think that there
are a couple of things.

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:05.750 align:middle line:84%
One is that so if we analyze
where we're at right now,

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:09.170 align:middle line:84%
we're very much-- if we--
just by looking at the volume

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:11.900 align:middle line:84%
activity, the reach
of activity, we

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.570 align:middle line:84%
can see we're at
the vital level.

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:17.330 align:middle line:84%
But even looking at it
much more specifically,

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:20.410 align:middle line:84%
the number of stock market
indices that have been created.

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:25.700 align:middle line:84%
You had cited the 55
trillion to 120 trillion

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.100 align:middle line:90%
in just less than a decade.

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:27.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Six years.

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:28.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Just the number of
crashes that have occurred.

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:34.160 align:middle line:90%
The variation in stock price.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.940 align:middle line:84%
The daily gains and
losses that have--

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.290 align:middle line:90%
the variation in that itself.

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:41.330 align:middle line:90%
That's all part of the vital--

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:43.950 align:middle line:84%
the fact that that's happening
so much more in the last 10,

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:47.690 align:middle line:84%
15 years is a sure indication
that the stock market

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:50.340 align:middle line:90%
itself is at the vital level.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And if we go back to this
notion of what's next,

00:33:56.470 --> 00:34:00.740 align:middle line:84%
what I'm proposing is that
this physical to the vital

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:04.420 align:middle line:84%
to the mental, so this
seed becoming a flower

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:10.370 align:middle line:84%
is a sustainable
pattern of progress.

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And so we see it in
the flower, but even

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:17.420 align:middle line:84%
if we think about many different
progressive developments that

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:21.050 align:middle line:84%
have taken place
across the earth,

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:22.739 align:middle line:84%
we'll see that
same pattern, where

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:24.889 align:middle line:84%
there's a shift from the
physical to the vital

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:26.719 align:middle line:90%
to the mental.

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And so when we
think about what's

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.449 align:middle line:84%
next in terms of the
market, then there

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:36.590 align:middle line:84%
is this notion that we
have to move from the vital

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:38.199 align:middle line:90%
to the mental.

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think you've made
a really good case for that.

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:46.850 align:middle line:84%
We can't stay in this unstable
phase any longer, that's

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:50.989 align:middle line:84%
essentially ready to burst
beyond anything physical

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:52.949 align:middle line:90%
or tangible any longer.

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're
in this vital stage,

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:58.820 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, as
you have mentioned,

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:02.420 align:middle line:84%
we have moved into, essentially,
a global community when

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:04.190 align:middle line:90%
it comes to commerce and money.

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:06.230 align:middle line:90%
Globalization has occurred.

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a concept
in the future.

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.330 align:middle line:90%


00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:19.970 align:middle line:84%
So how do you bring the mental
aspect of commerce and movement

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:23.540 align:middle line:84%
of funds and such-- not funds,
but development of markets,

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:26.540 align:middle line:84%
into this globalization,
this global environment that

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.600 align:middle line:84%
has already occurred,
in a democratic fashion,

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:32.840 align:middle line:84%
as an example of the
solar or the sun influence

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.490 align:middle line:90%
on the planet and the seed?

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:36.060 align:middle line:90%
How does that-- how do we begin?

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.620 align:middle line:84%
I think that's really
the crux of it.

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:42.290 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to say
one more thing, actually.

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:47.780 align:middle line:10%
And that's when we think
about the vital level,

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:51.020 align:middle line:10%
it's like this.

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.730 align:middle line:10%
We've talked about
the volume of flows

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:55.250 align:middle line:10%
that have changed, the rhythm
of flows that have changed

00:35:55.250 --> 00:36:00.980 align:middle line:10%
substantially, and
essentially, the recipient

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:04.850 align:middle line:10%
of any of these volume
and rhythm of flows

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:07.400 align:middle line:10%
now gets subjected
at the vital level

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.840 align:middle line:10%
to something
completely different

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.810 align:middle line:10%
from their innate nature.

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And so what's happening
is that if there

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:19.490 align:middle line:84%
is any kind of resonance in
that receiving object or market

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:23.090 align:middle line:84%
or corporation to
these forces, then--

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:25.700 align:middle line:84%
which we know are
totally vital--

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:30.120 align:middle line:84%
then that aspect comes
forward from that entity.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:34.760 align:middle line:84%
So what we've seen today in the
play out of the vital market

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:39.500 align:middle line:84%
is essentially the
vital part of what's

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:43.250 align:middle line:84%
contained in markets
or in corporations

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:47.390 align:middle line:84%
or in people is what's
coming to the front.

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:49.105 align:middle line:90%
And so there's a resonance.

00:36:49.105 --> 00:36:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Give us an example of that.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:53.900 align:middle line:90%
So I know exactly what you mean.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>> So just stepping back in--

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:58.363 align:middle line:90%
two things.

00:36:58.363 --> 00:36:59.700 align:middle line:90%
I'll talk about two things.

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:07.770 align:middle line:84%
One is that the notion of
when something is subjected

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:11.979 align:middle line:84%
to love, for instance,
then if there's love in it,

00:37:11.979 --> 00:37:13.145 align:middle line:90%
it's going to respond with--

00:37:13.145 --> 00:37:17.720 align:middle line:84%
then love is going to
probably come forward.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:22.420 align:middle line:84%
If something is subjected to
hate, if there's hate in it,

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.780 align:middle line:90%
hate is going to come forward.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:29.990 align:middle line:84%
So these incredible vital flows,
which are about fear and greed,

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:35.450 align:middle line:84%
they're creating a resonance at
a very minute or micro level,

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:41.120 align:middle line:84%
at the individual level, at
the level of corporations,

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.760 align:middle line:84%
to also function
in a similar way.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:49.670 align:middle line:84%
So the very fact that we've gone
through this huge arc whereby

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:52.070 align:middle line:84%
everything has been
appropriated into, in a sense,

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:59.060 align:middle line:84%
one global mechanism means that
all these different entities,

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:02.690 align:middle line:84%
there's a part of themselves,
or their consciousness

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:07.320 align:middle line:84%
is being overshadowed by this
vital aspect of greed and fear,

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.800 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we're
seeing a lot more of.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And so the question
is how do we bridge

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:14.660 align:middle line:90%
from that to the mental level?

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:16.406 align:middle line:90%
>> How do we?

00:38:16.406 --> 00:38:17.206 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:17.206 --> 00:38:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] That's a question.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.680 align:middle line:90%
So there's a couple of things.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:29.500 align:middle line:10%
And I'd say that
practically speaking,

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:34.870 align:middle line:10%
it can't be done suddenly,
because if it's--

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:37.060 align:middle line:10%
all of a sudden, if we allowed--

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.990 align:middle line:10%
if central banks
didn't intervene

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:42.910 align:middle line:10%
in the way that they did
right now, in the last three

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:45.520 align:middle line:10%
to four years, five years,
if they didn't suck up

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.880 align:middle line:10%
junk assets, if they didn't
make sure the money supply was

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:52.590 align:middle line:10%
unaffected, if they didn't
reduce interest rates, reduce--

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:56.410 align:middle line:10%
relatively speaking-- tax
rates, then there would be--

00:38:56.410 --> 00:39:00.370 align:middle line:10%
because of the huge
fall off of a lot

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:02.890 align:middle line:10%
of financial institutions,
there would be a huge crisis

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:04.120 align:middle line:10%
that would occur overnight.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:05.420 align:middle line:90%
Globally.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Globally.

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:07.360 align:middle line:90%
Globally yes.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:11.740 align:middle line:10%
And so if we think about
the intervention that's

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:15.820 align:middle line:10%
happened from the central
banks, in a sense,

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:20.290 align:middle line:10%
it's a good thing
because it's allowed

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:22.840 align:middle line:10%
the way that people have
lived at the ground level

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.130 align:middle line:10%
to continue.

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:25.690 align:middle line:84%
The shock would
have been too great

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:29.650 align:middle line:84%
if all these domineering
institutions were

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.370 align:middle line:90%
allowed to fail overnight.

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think that as we
talk about a transition

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:35.914 align:middle line:84%
from vital to mental,
the very first step--

00:39:35.914 --> 00:39:37.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
two ways to do it.

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:39.880 align:middle line:10%
Either you can
stabilize a vital,

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.380 align:middle line:10%
knowing that it's
very temporary,

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.650 align:middle line:10%
and that now you need to build
a bridge towards the mental,

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:47.440 align:middle line:10%
or you can just take a
leap into the mental,

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.310 align:middle line:10%
and allow things to
totally crash and burn,

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:54.100 align:middle line:10%
and then something else
will emerge from that,

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:55.870 align:middle line:10%
but there'll be a lot
of pain associated

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:58.220 align:middle line:10%
with it in the short term.

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we're
at this critical stage

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:05.170 align:middle line:84%
now where all these different
institutions continue

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:07.060 align:middle line:90%
to uphold the--

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>> The triage has
already occurred, right?

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:13.930 align:middle line:84%
To keep people so they can
afford, for the most part, food

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and a roof over
their heads, and--

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:19.690 align:middle line:84%
the basics have continued
on for the most part.

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And I know there are some
countries and people who

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:25.960 align:middle line:90%
have suffered greatly.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.700 align:middle line:84%
But generally
speaking, globally,

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:32.340 align:middle line:84%
life has gone on as usual, if
to a lower standard of living.

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's true, and
it's brought up a lot

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:37.000 align:middle line:90%
of questions for us to look at.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as the
money has gone away,

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:40.510 align:middle line:90%
the ability for people to--

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:43.030 align:middle line:84%
for example-- buy
homes has gone away.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Young people to be able to
have their own apartment.

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.520 align:middle line:84%
A lot of that's gone
in the Western world.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Now people are living
together again.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:52.660 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people in
their 20s and even 30s

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:55.240 align:middle line:84%
are moving back into their
parents' homes because

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.070 align:middle line:84%
of the lack of
availability of work.

00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:00.220 align:middle line:84%
So this is part of
that triage period

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:03.760 align:middle line:84%
where we're having to start
adjusting our view of what

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:07.030 align:middle line:84%
has value in life,
which seems to me is

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:10.810 align:middle line:84%
an appropriate precursor to
the mental, because isn't it

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:14.060 align:middle line:84%
about establishing true
value again across the board?

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:15.660 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think that from
the perspective of what

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:25.300 align:middle line:84%
can be done at the level
of markets, so there's

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.830 align:middle line:84%
this bridge that
needs to be built.

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And the way that the
stock market itself

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:35.620 align:middle line:84%
functions can be
altered to allow

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:40.420 align:middle line:84%
more of a semblance of the
mental to come into being.

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, one of the
leading models, if you will,

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.520 align:middle line:84%
of modern financial development
has been this notion

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:56.770 align:middle line:90%
of efficient market hypothesis.

00:41:56.770 --> 00:41:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>> And what does that mean?

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:02.527 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's really where
a price, say, of a stock is,

00:42:02.527 --> 00:42:04.360 align:middle line:84%
quote, unquote,
"informationally efficient."

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.340 align:middle line:84%
It means it captures
all the realities that's

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.755 align:middle line:90%
happening in the market.

00:42:07.755 --> 00:42:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And so the price
totally reflects

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:14.650 align:middle line:84%
all the issues that need
to be considered and--

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Of the health of that
particular entity or company

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.000 align:middle line:90%
or whatnot.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.755 align:middle line:90%
I mean, so in efficient market--

00:42:21.755 --> 00:42:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Going back to the
way it used to be.

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Going back to the
way it used to be, yes.

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:29.500 align:middle line:84%
In efficient market
hypothesis, prices never lie.

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's all
about reflecting

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.890 align:middle line:90%
exactly what the reality is.

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:39.719 align:middle line:10%
But we know for a fact
that financial markets

00:42:39.719 --> 00:42:41.260 align:middle line:10%
don't function that
way, because they

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:45.160 align:middle line:10%
function by this notion
of greed and fear.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Does this mean establishing
a new type of index based

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:50.150 align:middle line:90%
on that, for example?

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:51.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes, definitely.

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:54.950 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a few different
things that need to be done.

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:58.300 align:middle line:84%
But I brought that up because
what I was trying to get at

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:01.630 align:middle line:84%
was that the way that the
stock is traded right now

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:03.970 align:middle line:84%
is not based on efficient
market hypothesis,

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:07.420 align:middle line:84%
it's based on this
notion of fear and greed.

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:10.930 align:middle line:10%
And if we want to begin to
approach the mental level,

00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:12.670 align:middle line:10%
we have to change
the way that stock

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:18.174 align:middle line:10%
is created so that it
approaches more this reality

00:43:18.174 --> 00:43:19.465 align:middle line:10%
of efficient market hypothesis.

00:43:19.465 --> 00:43:22.240 align:middle line:10%
So When we think about
efficient market hypothesis,

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.100 align:middle line:10%
it's having a lot
more information

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.830 align:middle line:10%
that's true about the
environment being reflected

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:27.670 align:middle line:10%
in the stock price.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:28.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Transparency, too.

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:29.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Transparency.

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:29.910 align:middle line:10%
Yes, absolutely.

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:33.520 align:middle line:10%
And so all the costs
that were externalized,

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:35.900 align:middle line:10%
whether environmentally,
socially,

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.650 align:middle line:10%
that were not reflected
in the price of an asset

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:40.960 align:middle line:10%
or the price of a stock
need to be reflected

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.580 align:middle line:10%
in the price of the stock.

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's not going
to be done voluntarily.

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:48.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be done by the
way these indexes are set up.

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So we would have to, in
a sense, change the way

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:56.200 align:middle line:84%
the stock market functions so
that that information can come

00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:02.140 align:middle line:84%
into it that's required so
that the right kind of trades

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:05.000 align:middle line:84%
happen based on the true cost
or the true price of what's

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:05.800 align:middle line:90%
being traded.

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:05.904 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:44:05.904 --> 00:44:07.030 align:middle line:90%
It makes total sense.

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the point that
you had brought up around

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:10.670 align:middle line:90%
the index.

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Yes, a totally new kind of
index needs to be created

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:15.380 align:middle line:90%
or already exists.

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:17.430 align:middle line:84%
The more fundamentally
weighted indexes.

00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:20.950 align:middle line:90%
So what drives stock markets--

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Stock market
indices today, if we

00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:25.160 align:middle line:84%
think about the Dow Jones
Industrial Average is a price

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:25.960 align:middle line:90%
weighted index.

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:28.600 align:middle line:10%
If we think about
NASDAQ and S&P,

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.630 align:middle line:10%
they are market
weighted indices.

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And both those indices would
be great if we already operate

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.920 align:middle line:84%
at the mental level, but
the fact is, we don't.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And so at the vital
level, they just

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:44.860 align:middle line:84%
magnify whatever the direction
that things are already

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:46.060 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.240 align:middle line:90%
They already go there.

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:49.480 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
is that we would

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:52.540 align:middle line:84%
need to put much more
weightage on fundamentally

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:53.344 align:middle line:90%
weighted indices.

00:44:53.344 --> 00:44:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And fundamentally
weighted indices

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.190 align:middle line:84%
means that we're getting
to the true value

00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:58.810 align:middle line:84%
that a company is
actually creating.

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:01.270 align:middle line:90%
So what are it's true sales?

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:02.380 align:middle line:90%
What are its true costs?

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:04.970 align:middle line:90%
What are its earnings?

00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:06.550 align:middle line:90%
What is it actually doing?

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And that information
is used to weight

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:12.220 align:middle line:90%
a proportion in an index.

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:15.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's much more
realistic, and it

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:17.410 align:middle line:90%
begins to ground things more.

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:21.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's not this huge bubble
that's being acted on,

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:26.740 align:middle line:84%
but there's a ground reality
by which investors can

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:29.920 align:middle line:90%
make more grounded decisions.

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there somewhere
where this already exists?

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.320 align:middle line:90%
Is being tried, or?

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I'm not exactly
sure if it's actually existing

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:44.380 align:middle line:84%
in any of the stock markets
today, or if it's an index.

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:49.370 align:middle line:10%
But in studies
that have been done

00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:53.770 align:middle line:10%
where you have fundamentally
weighted indexes versus, say,

00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:58.330 align:middle line:10%
price weighted or the
market weighted indices

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:01.960 align:middle line:10%
over a period of 30 to
40 years, those studies

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:05.860 align:middle line:10%
have indicated that the
fundamentally weighted index

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:11.890 align:middle line:10%
would outperform existing
indexes that are primarily

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:16.430 align:middle line:10%
used to filter funds
into the stock market.

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if it's
actually being used,

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:21.970 align:middle line:84%
but studies indicate
that it would--

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:25.870 align:middle line:84%
by looking at real
companies, there was--

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:27.700 align:middle line:84%
I forget who did
the study, but it

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:31.650 align:middle line:84%
indicates that it would
yield a higher return.

00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Instead of this unstable stuff,
where it's flying one day

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:38.770 align:middle line:90%
and crashing the next.

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:41.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:45.100 align:middle line:84%
So is what we're looking at
more or less along the line,

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:46.720 align:middle line:84%
in just colloquial
terms, of what

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:49.810 align:middle line:84%
would be called socially
responsible investing

00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:50.950 align:middle line:90%
in addition to that?

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Is that an add-on to that, or
a part of this fundamentally?

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>> It's an add-on.

00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:00.850 align:middle line:10%
So I think that that's a really
good point, because actually,

00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:05.260 align:middle line:10%
what the market has been going
the way that it has been going

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:08.470 align:middle line:10%
for a few decades, and
especially since 1995

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:12.880 align:middle line:10%
to now, where things have gotten
incredibly in the vital level.

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.610 align:middle line:10%
And there's been
this natural reaction

00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:19.690 align:middle line:10%
from a number of
stakeholders around the world

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:23.230 align:middle line:10%
to put sanity into the way
investments take place.

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Socially responsible
investing has, of course,

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.164 align:middle line:84%
been going on for
probably as long

00:47:29.164 --> 00:47:30.580 align:middle line:84%
as the institution
of business has

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.820 align:middle line:84%
existed, from the
religiously minded who--

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:35.170 align:middle line:90%
initially we have said, OK.

00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Keep away from sin
industries or industries

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:39.920 align:middle line:84%
that harm your
health, and so on.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.940 align:middle line:84%
But that's become a much
bigger movement today.

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:47.890 align:middle line:84%
So of the available investments
of $25 trillion or so

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:53.200 align:middle line:84%
in the US, $3 trillion of that
is through socially responsible

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.502 align:middle line:90%
investing.

00:47:54.502 --> 00:47:55.710 align:middle line:90%
So it's a growing percentage.

00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:56.004 align:middle line:90%
>> That's big.

00:47:56.004 --> 00:47:56.200 align:middle line:90%
That's growing.

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:56.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:57.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And then in addition to
that, just following up on that,

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:03.640 align:middle line:84%
that's from-- so perhaps when
we think about it from the shift

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.440 align:middle line:90%
from the vital to the mental.

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.690 align:middle line:84%
We can see that socially
responsible investing

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:11.117 align:middle line:84%
is perhaps from those
stakeholders who are already

00:48:11.117 --> 00:48:11.950 align:middle line:90%
at the mental level.

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:13.116 align:middle line:90%
>> At the mental level, yes.

00:48:13.116 --> 00:48:14.080 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>> But then if we think about
other movements that are

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:17.130 align:middle line:90%
occurring.

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:21.620 align:middle line:10%
So have this whole--

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:24.580 align:middle line:10%
the GRI, the Global
Reporting Initiative

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:27.460 align:middle line:10%
that started, again,
in reaction to the way

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:29.750 align:middle line:10%
that things have been
going the last 15 years

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:36.440 align:middle line:10%
or so, where there's a lot
more parameters, factors that

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:39.800 align:middle line:10%
have to do with the environment
and cost to society that

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.740 align:middle line:10%
are also integrated
into evaluating

00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:45.290 align:middle line:10%
or how a company is doing.

00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So that becomes
a filter as well.

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:49.450 align:middle line:84%
So you have that
movement, the GRI.

00:48:49.450 --> 00:48:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Then you have PRI,
which is the Principles

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:55.910 align:middle line:84%
of Responsible Investing,
which is financial institutions

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:59.560 align:middle line:84%
themselves looking at how
they can be more responsible

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:03.770 align:middle line:84%
and factor in environmental,
social governance

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:07.520 align:middle line:84%
considerations into who
they choose to invest with.

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So a number of
different stakeholders

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:13.220 align:middle line:84%
around the world who perhaps
we can say are more at that--

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:16.080 align:middle line:84%
either at the mental level
or wanting to go there,

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:20.630 align:middle line:84%
are putting into place
these different frameworks

00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:21.750 align:middle line:90%
from the outside.

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And then the fact also is that
there's been this huge movement

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:28.010 align:middle line:90%
from the bottom up.

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:30.273 align:middle line:10%
Peter Hawkins, in his
book, "Blessed Unrest"--

00:49:30.273 --> 00:49:31.106 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, Paul Hawkins.

00:49:31.106 --> 00:49:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:33.080 align:middle line:90%
I mean Paul Hawkins.

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:33.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:38.720 align:middle line:84%
He reflects on how a million
to 2 million organizations

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:42.830 align:middle line:84%
around the world
are actually trying

00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:45.770 align:middle line:84%
to combat a lot of the
environmental and social ills

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:47.480 align:middle line:84%
that have been
created as a result

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:50.930 align:middle line:84%
of our irresponsible
investing in business.

00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And to say nothing
of Occupy Wall Street.

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:54.351 align:middle line:90%
>> Occupy Wall Street, exactly.

00:49:54.351 --> 00:49:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Just basically objecting
to the way money is used

00:49:57.230 --> 00:50:00.650 align:middle line:84%
and managed and
exploited and wasted.

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:02.220 align:middle line:90%
Just that in itself.

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:03.820 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that what's
being indicated just very

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:11.870 align:middle line:84%
organically from the way that
business flow is interacting

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:14.600 align:middle line:84%
with life is that there are
a number of stakeholders

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:17.262 align:middle line:84%
from many different places
and perspectives who

00:50:17.262 --> 00:50:18.470 align:middle line:90%
are waking up and saying, no.

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:19.428 align:middle line:90%
This isn't going to do.

00:50:19.428 --> 00:50:22.520 align:middle line:90%
And the question is how can we--

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:24.830 align:middle line:84%
what I talk about in
the book is how can we

00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:28.160 align:middle line:84%
really go the next
step and integrate that

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.770 align:middle line:84%
into the actual way that
the stock market functions.

00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:33.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's well and
good when you have

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:36.080 align:middle line:84%
all these different filters
being applied from the outside,

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:38.510 align:middle line:84%
and you have indices
that are set up

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:42.086 align:middle line:84%
that may filter funds
into the stock market,

00:50:42.086 --> 00:50:43.460 align:middle line:84%
but the question
is can the stock

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:48.110 align:middle line:84%
market itself be changed so
that these filters become part

00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:51.390 align:middle line:84%
of the heuristics that
automatically determine

00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:54.650 align:middle line:84%
the pricing of stocks
on a day-to-day basis.

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>> What's the answer to that?

00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Currently, no.

00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:59.810 align:middle line:84%
I think absolutely possible
with the technology

00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:02.340 align:middle line:90%
that we have existing today.

00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:06.170 align:middle line:84%
So when we think about
what would it really take

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:09.530 align:middle line:84%
to make something like that
work, just very practically

00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:11.960 align:middle line:84%
speaking, you would
need to have sensors

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:15.080 align:middle line:84%
in the environment, nano
sensors that would pick up

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:18.200 align:middle line:84%
if there was any
kind of compromise

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:22.160 align:middle line:84%
to, say, the quality of
water or the quality of air

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.120 align:middle line:90%
or the quality of the soil.

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you had nano sensors
in these different places,

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:29.060 align:middle line:90%
it would pick it up.

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And then these could be part
of a network, a secure network,

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:37.640 align:middle line:84%
that are fed back into stock
exchanges around the world.

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And you would have filters
and the actual algorithms that

00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:47.720 align:middle line:84%
exist or that should exist in
the functioning of the stock

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:50.450 align:middle line:84%
market, to take
into account some

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:52.340 align:middle line:84%
of these different
real-time inputs

00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:58.040 align:middle line:84%
that are very, very
important in factoring

00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:59.430 align:middle line:90%
what a stock price should be.

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if we know
for a fact that you have, say,

00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:11.640 align:middle line:84%
a corporation like when the oil
spill happened just last year--

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:12.980 align:middle line:90%
BP.

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:13.780 align:middle line:90%
>> BP.

00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:16.070 align:middle line:90%
BP, yes.

00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:18.740 align:middle line:10%
You have sensors that
pick up that something's

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:22.250 align:middle line:10%
totally awry over
there, and then you

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:25.700 align:middle line:10%
know what the source of that is.

00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:28.760 align:middle line:84%
This would go and put an
automatic stop on trading

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:34.820 align:middle line:84%
of BP and plus slow down the
whole category of oil and gas,

00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:38.486 align:middle line:84%
so every other company in
that, until it could be proven

00:52:38.486 --> 00:52:40.610 align:middle line:84%
by those companies that
they were putting in place,

00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:46.910 align:middle line:84%
or they had in place
various practical approaches

00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:50.570 align:middle line:84%
to change any kind
of degradation

00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:52.970 align:middle line:84%
to the environment
or social costs,

00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:54.830 align:middle line:84%
they have the right
technologies in place.

00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And then only, the
price would be released.

00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:58.838 align:middle line:84%
The stock price would allowed
to be traded or allowed

00:52:58.838 --> 00:53:00.240 align:middle line:90%
to climb back to its level.

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:02.180 align:middle line:10%
So there's several
things that can--

00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:04.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Much more sophisticated
level of reporting.

00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:06.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>> And oversight.

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes and the reason why I went
there at all in this book is

00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:15.020 align:middle line:90%
the reality of where we're at.

00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:18.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when it comes down to
trading, at the end of the day,

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:20.450 align:middle line:84%
it is the quote,
unquote, "fight."

00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:22.620 align:middle line:84%
The physical,
vital consciousness

00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:27.670 align:middle line:84%
of this notion of greed that
overpowers other instincts.

00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:30.660 align:middle line:10%
And whether you're an investor
or-- the stock markets

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:33.570 align:middle line:10%
themselves are
for-profit institutions

00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:36.360 align:middle line:10%
that are often publicly traded.

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:39.150 align:middle line:10%
So there's a very
controversial set

00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:42.510 align:middle line:10%
of dynamics in stock
markets themselves

00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:45.050 align:middle line:10%
in that they can't necessarily--

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:50.430 align:middle line:10%
their incentive is to create
profit for their shareholders.

00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:56.610 align:middle line:10%
And so an easy way to do that
is to list more companies,

00:53:56.610 --> 00:53:59.230 align:middle line:10%
regardless of the kind
of company that it is.

00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of the
kinds of practices

00:54:00.730 --> 00:54:03.330 align:middle line:84%
that those companies
might be involved in.

00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And every trade that happens,
they benefit from it,

00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:08.460 align:middle line:90%
whether it's a sell or a buy.

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:10.320 align:middle line:84%
The stock market
benefits from it.

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:13.320 align:middle line:84%
The shareholders
benefit from it.

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.870 align:middle line:90%
The investors benefit from it.

00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:19.210 align:middle line:84%
The company likely
benefits from it.

00:54:19.210 --> 00:54:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And so that whole
infrastructure of currently,

00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:24.900 align:middle line:84%
the way that it's
set up, it's not

00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:29.082 align:middle line:84%
really incentive to have
something that's objective.

00:54:29.082 --> 00:54:29.882 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:54:29.882 --> 00:54:33.950 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say, you have
the fox watching the hen house,

00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:34.750 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>> What's it going to take to be
able to put another layer of--

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:42.760 align:middle line:84%
and I don't like the notion
of greater governments,

00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:46.260 align:middle line:84%
but just a sense
of responsibility.

00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Some kind of
governing factor that

00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:51.280 align:middle line:84%
adds this layer of
responsibility over the markets

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:52.080 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Do you even see this
happening, or do you

00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:55.890 align:middle line:84%
see it more having to
collapse and something

00:54:55.890 --> 00:54:58.980 align:middle line:84%
new being given birth
to with newer standards?

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So my hope is that we don't
have to go through a whole

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:06.810 align:middle line:84%
collapse and the huge damage
that that causes in order

00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:09.840 align:middle line:90%
to get there.

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.840 align:middle line:10%
But the reality is that the
way that we're going right now,

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:17.010 align:middle line:10%
and the fact that none of the
governments around the world,

00:55:17.010 --> 00:55:21.360 align:middle line:10%
or policymakers, are really
making any substantial shifts

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:24.730 align:middle line:10%
that need to be made to the
financial environment, I mean,

00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:27.180 align:middle line:10%
what they've been doing
is just allowing things

00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:29.700 align:middle line:10%
to proceed the way that
they've always proceeded

00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:32.980 align:middle line:10%
and getting things
back to usual business.

00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And so when you look at
that it's questionable.

00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And then it's these
movements like Occupy

00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:44.190 align:middle line:84%
or the 2 million organizations
that Paul Hawkins talks about,

00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:47.800 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is that
you have to rely on.

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:52.440 align:middle line:84%
So there's this notion power
of the people or democracy,

00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:54.810 align:middle line:84%
true democracy that would
have to come in place

00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:57.600 align:middle line:90%
to allow something to /

00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And in the interim,
since we can't--

00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:03.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we can afford to
have the kind of catastrophe

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:06.780 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about or the
kinds of irresponsible trades

00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:09.000 align:middle line:84%
continuing the way that
they've been continuing.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Because if we look at
the way that stock--

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:16.290 align:middle line:84%
the volume has risen
from 1995 to 2010.

00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And the irresponsibility
of many corporations

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.480 align:middle line:84%
have been recipients
of those funds.

00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:24.200 align:middle line:10%
We see a correlation between--

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:28.830 align:middle line:10%
they are kind of-- the way
that they might exploit

00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:31.770 align:middle line:10%
environmental and social
conditions in order to make

00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:34.230 align:middle line:10%
sure that they get profit.

00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And so we see that as a
fact, that as a market

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.110 align:middle line:84%
receives more funds
in the stock market,

00:56:40.110 --> 00:56:42.810 align:middle line:84%
it's irresponsibility
factor also goes up.

00:56:42.810 --> 00:56:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>> It increases, yes.

00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So in the face of that,
as an interim measure,

00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:52.770 align:middle line:84%
this more sophisticated
reporting where you have nano

00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:57.240 align:middle line:84%
sensors might be coming into
providing information in real

00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.050 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:56:58.050 --> 00:56:59.460 align:middle line:84%
That would be an
interim measure.

00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:04.770 align:middle line:84%
But again, the real key is that
this shift of consciousness

00:57:04.770 --> 00:57:08.520 align:middle line:84%
that needs to happen at the
consumer level, from the vital

00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:10.446 align:middle line:90%
to a mental level.

00:57:10.446 --> 00:57:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So just a quick
question then,

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:13.694 align:middle line:84%
because I know we're
almost out of time here.

00:57:13.694 --> 00:57:15.940 align:middle line:90%
We could go on quite a bit.

00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:20.370 align:middle line:84%
If you're a consumer who
wishes to participate

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:26.490 align:middle line:84%
in the market or markets in a
responsible, reflective way,

00:57:26.490 --> 00:57:29.640 align:middle line:84%
how do we go about that right
now in this insane environment?

00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:30.570 --> 00:57:36.750 align:middle line:10%
So right now, it's making
sure that the number

00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:39.720 align:middle line:10%
of indices, the socially
responsible indices

00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:41.310 align:middle line:10%
are increasing.

00:57:41.310 --> 00:57:43.110 align:middle line:84%
There's free-- for
example, even Dow Jones

00:57:43.110 --> 00:57:44.693 align:middle line:84%
has created a Dow
Jones Sustainability

00:57:44.693 --> 00:57:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Index, which currently has
maybe $8 billion in its market.

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:53.070 align:middle line:90%
Not much.

00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:55.260 align:middle line:84%
But that's certainly
one way is make sure

00:57:55.260 --> 00:58:01.380 align:middle line:84%
that we're investing in a
socially responsible company--

00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:06.900 align:middle line:84%
in financial institutions that
have signed those principles

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:10.650 align:middle line:84%
for responsible investing
that now a much larger number

00:58:10.650 --> 00:58:13.200 align:middle line:90%
of institutes have signed them.

00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Making sure that if there's a
fund manager or mutual funds,

00:58:17.610 --> 00:58:21.930 align:middle line:84%
that they have filters
to really ensure

00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:24.510 align:middle line:84%
that the money is being used
for environmentally and socially

00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:25.470 align:middle line:90%
responsible companies.

00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Or even in stock markets,
some leading practices,

00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:29.870 align:middle line:84%
some stock markets
for example, if we

00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:34.190 align:middle line:84%
look at Johannesburg
stock market,

00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:36.740 align:middle line:84%
they've instituted
a practice where

00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:39.740 align:middle line:84%
each of the companies who
lists on the stock markets

00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:43.040 align:middle line:84%
needs to have
integrated reporting.

00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:47.570 align:middle line:84%
So the annual report, you have
to have a CSR report integrated

00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:49.380 align:middle line:90%
in with the annual report.

00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And so that again is a
whole level of disclosure.

00:58:52.350 --> 00:58:55.610 align:middle line:84%
So checking to see
what was really--

00:58:55.610 --> 00:58:58.010 align:middle line:84%
how the stock exchange
itself is functioning.

00:58:58.010 --> 00:59:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Or in Taiwan, we have
a similar best practice

00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:05.250 align:middle line:84%
where each of the
listed companies

00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:09.374 align:middle line:84%
is expected-- they have
to provide disclosure

00:59:09.374 --> 00:59:11.540 align:middle line:84%
on their environmental and
social practices in order

00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:12.380 align:middle line:90%
to list.

00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:13.100 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's starting.

00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>> It's starting.

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>> The seeds have been planted.

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And so it's up to us now
to not put our money in these

00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:22.590 align:middle line:84%
places with this manic
depressive ride any longer.

00:59:22.590 --> 00:59:24.650 align:middle line:84%
We need to pull that
out, and we need

00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:28.670 align:middle line:84%
to place it with some, as you
say, research and intelligence

00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:32.390 align:middle line:84%
into this emerging mental phase
of consciousness in markets.

00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:33.590 align:middle line:90%
And that's up to us.

00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:35.520 align:middle line:84%
We have to do the
research ourselves.

00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:37.730 align:middle line:84%
But you've helped
us by giving us

00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:40.160 align:middle line:84%
some really good ideas toward
the tail end of this book.

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And at least-- and
also well defining what

00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:44.340 align:middle line:90%
the problem is to begin with.

00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:46.480 align:middle line:90%
And I really thank you for--

00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:49.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a-- I don't understand
markets that well, so thank you

00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:53.570 align:middle line:84%
for bearing with me in this
interview in our layperson's

00:59:53.570 --> 00:59:54.950 align:middle line:90%
conversation on all of it.

00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:59:56.550 --> 00:59:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:59:59.410 --> 01:00:01.120 align:middle line:84%

01:00:08.537 --> 01:00:10.870 align:middle line:84%
There's little doubt in my
mind that the existing market

01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:14.590 align:middle line:84%
must be reformed or perish as
a result of excessive bloating

01:00:14.590 --> 01:00:15.490 align:middle line:90%
and mismanagement.

01:00:15.490 --> 01:00:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Pavir gives us a
good look at what

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:20.800 align:middle line:84%
must be done to bring the
markets back to good health.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:23.790 align:middle line:84%
