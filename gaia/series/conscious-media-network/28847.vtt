00:00:00.802 --> 00:00:04.452
<v ->William Henry's favorite motto is, "Own the Dome."</v>

2
00:00:04.452 --> 00:00:07.054
This double entendre refers, not only to his work

3
00:00:07.054 --> 00:00:09.657
regarding the symbolism hidden in plain sight

4
00:00:09.657 --> 00:00:11.843
in the nation's Capitol, as popularized

5
00:00:11.843 --> 00:00:15.374
in Dan Brown's new book, but also to our own heads.

6
00:00:15.374 --> 00:00:18.445
He says we must own our minds and learn to master

7
00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:20.995
our master glands, which open us up

8
00:00:20.995 --> 00:00:23.405
to our greatest wisdom and deepest memories.

9
00:00:23.405 --> 00:00:26.264
He says we need to seek out those who can show us the way,

10
00:00:26.264 --> 00:00:28.697
including the ancients.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.622 line:15% 
(gentle electronic music)

12
00:00:37.714 --> 00:00:40.862
<v Regina>Our curiosity in this time</v>

13
00:00:40.862 --> 00:00:45.862
with the symbolism in Egyptian artifacts

14
00:00:46.344 --> 00:00:50.365
is going beyond just a curiosity now.

15
00:00:50.365 --> 00:00:51.667
There's a reason for all of this,

16
00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:53.758
and as you said at the beginning of your talk,

17
00:00:53.758 --> 00:00:58.758
that the object to the ancient ones, the pharaohs and such,

18
00:00:59.207 --> 00:01:02.023
were to find their way back to a status

19
00:01:02.023 --> 00:01:05.106
of being pure light in the form of a star.

20
00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:06.311
<v ->Right.</v>

21
00:01:06.311 --> 00:01:09.073
<v Regina>This going back into pure light is taking place</v>

22
00:01:09.073 --> 00:01:12.113
in many, many different interpretations now.

23
00:01:12.113 --> 00:01:15.025
The Egyptians didn't do anything by accident.

24
00:01:15.025 --> 00:01:18.385
Everything, every depiction, every glyph was for purpose.

25
00:01:18.385 --> 00:01:19.292
<v ->Right.</v>

26
00:01:19.292 --> 00:01:20.891
<v Regina>You really have done a wonderful job</v>

27
00:01:20.891 --> 00:01:23.043
of deciphering and opening new questions in this.

28
00:01:23.043 --> 00:01:23.939
<v ->Thank you.</v>

29
00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.755
<v Regina>Let's just start the conversation</v>

30
00:01:26.755 --> 00:01:28.867
where you were earlier this morning,

31
00:01:28.867 --> 00:01:31.949
in looking at the pyramids themselves

32
00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:34.744
and what you believe the pyramids served,

33
00:01:34.744 --> 00:01:36.130
functionally speaking.

34
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.549
<v ->Well, I'm of the school of thought, I guess,</v>

35
00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.458
that was opened up mostly by Robert Bauval

36
00:01:39.458 --> 00:01:41.239
and Graham Hancock, that the pyramids themselves

37
00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:43.330
are resurrection machines.

38
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.164
Not to step on Christianity's toes,

39
00:01:45.164 --> 00:01:47.298
but let's just kind of think about this.

40
00:01:47.298 --> 00:01:50.156
You've got a person that goes into a cave

41
00:01:50.156 --> 00:01:54.476
for three days and emerges as a light being.

42
00:01:54.476 --> 00:01:57.473
What if the cave is the great pyramid?

43
00:01:57.473 --> 00:01:59.212
Let's put it this way, why couldn't that cave

44
00:01:59.212 --> 00:02:00.332
be the great pyramid?

45
00:02:00.332 --> 00:02:01.771
It doesn't make sense that they would be

46
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:03.510
accessing this technology.

47
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.718
That's kind of one of the great cover-ups of all time,

48
00:02:05.718 --> 00:02:07.872
is that traditional Christianity usually

49
00:02:07.872 --> 00:02:10.496
traces its roots to Palestine, but actually,

50
00:02:10.496 --> 00:02:11.751
it's traced to Egypt.

51
00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:12.562
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

52
00:02:12.562 --> 00:02:14.706
<v ->When you trace it to Egypt, you are absolutely</v>

53
00:02:14.706 --> 00:02:16.487
confronted that, wait a minute, when you look at

54
00:02:16.487 --> 00:02:18.812
the three pyramids of Giza from the top down,

55
00:02:18.812 --> 00:02:20.764
not only, as Bauval says, do they resemble

56
00:02:20.764 --> 00:02:23.825
the three belt stars of Orion, which is controversial

57
00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:25.820
in some people's minds, but they also

58
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.145
look like three crosses sitting there.

59
00:02:28.145 --> 00:02:30.651
Isn't that the configuration of the crucifixion,

60
00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:32.187
three crosses?

61
00:02:32.187 --> 00:02:35.750
What if we're actually locating this event at Giza,

62
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.278
and suggesting that the pyramid was known

63
00:02:38.278 --> 00:02:40.037
at the time of Jesus and Mary Magdalene,

64
00:02:40.037 --> 00:02:41.947
and those other esoteric researchers,

65
00:02:41.947 --> 00:02:43.707
which is what they were, that the pyramid itself

66
00:02:43.707 --> 00:02:45.594
was the cave of transformation,

67
00:02:45.594 --> 00:02:47.354
that it's the resurrection machine.

68
00:02:47.354 --> 00:02:49.093
If they could master that, then you could

69
00:02:49.093 --> 00:02:52.879
beam yourself to other star systems as a light being.

70
00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.063
That makes a lot more sense to me

71
00:02:54.063 --> 00:02:55.898
than anything else I've looked at.

72
00:02:55.898 --> 00:02:58.223
<v Regina>You keep coming up with the word portal.</v>

73
00:02:58.223 --> 00:03:01.637
Portal comes up repeatedly, whether it is in Egyptology,

74
00:03:01.637 --> 00:03:03.931
or whether it's in Christianity, in terms of

75
00:03:03.931 --> 00:03:07.141
the artistic depictions of the Christ standing in front of

76
00:03:07.141 --> 00:03:09.157
these concentric circles or a portal

77
00:03:09.157 --> 00:03:11.578
going into some experience.

78
00:03:11.578 --> 00:03:14.223
<v ->Yeah, going into some other realm, exactly.</v>

79
00:03:14.223 --> 00:03:17.146
When I look at like the transfiguration of images,

80
00:03:17.146 --> 00:03:19.140
transfiguration images of Jesus you're mentioning,

81
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.794
he's got his bright white clothing on,

82
00:03:20.794 --> 00:03:24.271
symbolic of the light body, with the open gate behind him,

83
00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:25.881
usually composed of concentric rings.

84
00:03:25.881 --> 00:03:30.382
Sometimes his body has actually a star around it.

85
00:03:30.382 --> 00:03:33.518
He's become a star being, and this is pure

86
00:03:33.518 --> 00:03:36.953
Egyptian metaphysics, I call stargate metaphysics,

87
00:03:36.953 --> 00:03:38.552
because that's what it's ultimately about.

88
00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:41.315
The Egyptians believed that we had a divine essence

89
00:03:41.315 --> 00:03:43.267
within us that could become a star

90
00:03:43.267 --> 00:03:45.219
and live for eternity as a star being,

91
00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:48.076
sailing on these ships of eternity, as they called them,

92
00:03:48.076 --> 00:03:49.741
the ark of the millions of years,

93
00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:51.576
or the bark of the millions of years,

94
00:03:51.576 --> 00:03:53.346
that is U-shaped just exactly like

95
00:03:53.346 --> 00:03:56.130
the way modern science portrays the wormhole.

96
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.709
If we look at it from that perspective,

97
00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.610
it's saying they're transfiguring or transforming themselves

98
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.775
preparatory to entering that gate

99
00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:04.812
and traveling upon the wormholes

100
00:04:04.812 --> 00:04:07.969
that science says permeates the universe.

101
00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:09.740
<v Regina>If we look at it from a very simplistic</v>

102
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.436
point of view, many people believe,

103
00:04:11.436 --> 00:04:13.772
"Okay, you leave your body and you return to light,"

104
00:04:13.772 --> 00:04:15.723
you return to some other field.

105
00:04:15.723 --> 00:04:18.145
It's something as simple as this on one hand,

106
00:04:18.145 --> 00:04:21.462
but on another, we're talking about, in Egyptian times,

107
00:04:21.462 --> 00:04:26.462
what appears to be conscious, while in physical form,

108
00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:32.234
transiting between worlds.

109
00:04:32.234 --> 00:04:33.184
<v ->Right, exactly.</v>

110
00:04:33.184 --> 00:04:34.816
<v Regina>It seems that the symbolism</v>

111
00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:37.973
that is attendant with it, such as the ankh, for example,

112
00:04:37.973 --> 00:04:40.597
seem to have been tools for the ones

113
00:04:40.597 --> 00:04:43.424
who had knowledge to take their bodies

114
00:04:43.424 --> 00:04:46.047
from one dimension to another, and back safely again.

115
00:04:46.047 --> 00:04:49.065
Now, this has huge implications for us today.

116
00:04:49.065 --> 00:04:51.551
<v ->I believe so too, because you have the ankh,</v>

117
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:53.598
or the key of life, is one of the key symbols,

118
00:04:53.598 --> 00:04:57.705
which is actually a branch that grew on the tree of life,

119
00:04:57.705 --> 00:04:59.305
which is a whole other topic.

120
00:04:59.305 --> 00:05:01.555
Then they often are shown, especially those that are

121
00:05:01.555 --> 00:05:04.019
riding upon these arks of the millions of years,

122
00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:06.760
the wormholes, they hold the was scepter,

123
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.384
which some believe, like Schwaller de Lubicz believes,

124
00:05:09.384 --> 00:05:12.563
is a conductor of some kind of a cosmic sap.

125
00:05:12.563 --> 00:05:16.210
What if the sap is a subatomic particle

126
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.696
that keeps the mouth of the wormhole open?

127
00:05:18.696 --> 00:05:20.807
That's the complaint that physicists have is that,

128
00:05:20.807 --> 00:05:23.410
well, as you approach the mouth of that wormhole,

129
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.874
it's going to close before you can go through it

130
00:05:25.874 --> 00:05:28.146
unless, as Kip Thorne came up with this concept,

131
00:05:28.146 --> 00:05:30.769
you could have this exotic matter, as he called it,

132
00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:32.764
that held open the throat of that wormhole.

133
00:05:32.764 --> 00:05:35.505
That would be some kind of exotic subatomic particle,

134
00:05:35.505 --> 00:05:37.318
perhaps, that we haven't discovered yet,

135
00:05:37.318 --> 00:05:39.217
but maybe the Egyptians knew about it

136
00:05:39.217 --> 00:05:41.382
and that's why they're shown with this conductor,

137
00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:43.633
and they talk about this sap that keeps open

138
00:05:43.633 --> 00:05:45.680
the mouth or throat of this wormhole

139
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.814
long enough for you to pass through it.

140
00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:50.107
<v Regina>Here we're really having an overlay</v>

141
00:05:50.107 --> 00:05:54.203
of modern-day astrophysics with very ancient wisdoms

142
00:05:54.203 --> 00:05:56.058
that have been chronicled, and actually,

143
00:05:56.058 --> 00:05:59.749
it seems to me even twisted and made into pretzels

144
00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:04.325
to go into some of the more esoteric cult practices,

145
00:06:04.325 --> 00:06:05.626
and rituals and so forth.

146
00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:06.390
<v ->Right.</v>

147
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.054
<v Regina>Which is a very watered down version.</v>

148
00:06:08.054 --> 00:06:08.982
<v ->Totally.</v>

149
00:06:08.982 --> 00:06:10.422
<v Regina>It seems almost as though</v>

150
00:06:10.422 --> 00:06:12.171
the understanding of the original intent

151
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:13.398
of what the Egyptians were doing

152
00:06:13.398 --> 00:06:15.831
has been completely lost in favor of just plain ritual,

153
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:17.079
<v ->Oh, I agree.</v>

154
00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:18.305
<v Regina>Days of boys rituals.</v>

155
00:06:18.305 --> 00:06:19.265
<v ->Right, exactly.</v>

156
00:06:19.265 --> 00:06:20.886
<v Regina>To join the social club.</v>

157
00:06:20.886 --> 00:06:23.627
If we go back, what appears to be primitive art

158
00:06:23.627 --> 00:06:26.507
because of its kind of flat, one-dimensional nature,

159
00:06:26.507 --> 00:06:29.174
the way things are portrayed, in reality isn't.

160
00:06:29.174 --> 00:06:31.894
Let's talk about this, as you say,

161
00:06:31.894 --> 00:06:33.984
the ship of a million --

162
00:06:33.984 --> 00:06:35.307
<v ->Millions of years.</v>

163
00:06:35.307 --> 00:06:38.069
<v Regina>The ship of millions of years and the wormhole.</v>

164
00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:41.738
In words, diagram what you see there

165
00:06:41.738 --> 00:06:43.968
and what is there for all to see,

166
00:06:43.968 --> 00:06:46.517
as overlaid with modern-day astrophysics and wormholes.

167
00:06:46.517 --> 00:06:48.053
<v ->Right, so the idea is like when you're in</v>

168
00:06:48.053 --> 00:06:50.719
Temple of Dendera, you go up and you look on the ceiling.

169
00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:52.746
They call it the astrological ceiling, and it shows

170
00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:54.698
these various gods, deities,

171
00:06:54.698 --> 00:06:58.548
riding on the ships of eternity, sailing into the stars.

172
00:06:58.548 --> 00:07:01.940
These ships, again, are drawn by the ancient Egyptians

173
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.001
3500 years ago with the same symbolism

174
00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:08.010
that modern science, suddenly within the past 25 years,

175
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.978
has adopted to represent the ultimate time travel concept,

176
00:07:11.978 --> 00:07:14.026
travel through a wormhole.

177
00:07:14.026 --> 00:07:16.340
I don't think that that's by accident.

178
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.196
I think what we're doing is rediscovering

179
00:07:18.196 --> 00:07:21.385
the original sacred science of the Egyptians.

180
00:07:21.385 --> 00:07:23.284
I furthermore think that if we can interpret

181
00:07:23.284 --> 00:07:26.420
that symbolism, we must be a whole lot closer

182
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.556
to being able to actually do what that symbolism suggests,

183
00:07:29.556 --> 00:07:31.955
travel through the stars through these wormholes,

184
00:07:31.955 --> 00:07:34.814
than a lot of modern sciences would actually allow.

185
00:07:34.814 --> 00:07:37.064
They think we're a million years away

186
00:07:37.064 --> 00:07:38.760
from being able to do that.

187
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.382
I think that's ridiculous.

188
00:07:40.382 --> 00:07:42.376
I think that's absurd.

189
00:07:42.376 --> 00:07:44.307
<v Regina>Let's look at the practical implications of it,</v>

190
00:07:44.307 --> 00:07:46.728
because when you're talking about this in myth and lore,

191
00:07:46.728 --> 00:07:51.293
you might be talking about the story of Osiris, for example.

192
00:07:51.293 --> 00:07:53.618
Moving that concept forward into teleportation,

193
00:07:53.618 --> 00:07:55.453
let's talk about the link right there,

194
00:07:55.453 --> 00:07:58.012
which I found it was really an epiphany for me

195
00:07:58.012 --> 00:08:00.796
for a personal reason when you talked about that.

196
00:08:00.796 --> 00:08:02.215
Let's talk about Osiris.

197
00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:04.209
<v ->Right, well, when we're talking about Osiris,</v>

198
00:08:04.209 --> 00:08:07.313
traditionally we're talking about a man,

199
00:08:07.313 --> 00:08:10.620
the companion of Isis, the Egyptian savior figure

200
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.796
who is tricked by his brother, Set,

201
00:08:12.796 --> 00:08:15.078
into putting himself into this coffin.

202
00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:19.024
When he does that, he is cut into pieces, 14 of them.

203
00:08:19.024 --> 00:08:21.222
Then Isis goes along and collects all the pieces,

204
00:08:21.222 --> 00:08:23.088
and the reassembles him.

205
00:08:23.088 --> 00:08:25.285
Well that, to me, sounds like something out of Star Trek,

206
00:08:25.285 --> 00:08:27.611
when they stand on the teleporter,

207
00:08:27.611 --> 00:08:29.957
then their body is disassembled

208
00:08:29.957 --> 00:08:32.208
and then it's reassembled at another location.

209
00:08:32.208 --> 00:08:33.830
That got me thinking, "Well, I wonder if that's

210
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.345
"what's being portrayed here?"

211
00:08:35.345 --> 00:08:37.435
That's the traditional Osiris story.

212
00:08:37.435 --> 00:08:39.387
Then you also, when you go to Abydos,

213
00:08:39.387 --> 00:08:42.427
which is Egypt's oldest sacred site,

214
00:08:42.427 --> 00:08:45.072
a place of continuous pilgrimage for over 3,000 years

215
00:08:45.072 --> 00:08:47.418
and known as the gate of the underworld,

216
00:08:47.418 --> 00:08:49.946
you see another representation of Osiris.

217
00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:51.685
This time he's not portrayed as a man,

218
00:08:51.685 --> 00:08:55.194
he's portrayed as, what I figure, is a device.

219
00:08:55.194 --> 00:08:56.773
I use that word device intentionally,

220
00:08:56.773 --> 00:08:58.959
because a device is a instrument,

221
00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:00.602
it's a tool, it's a technology,

222
00:09:00.602 --> 00:09:02.511
but it's also a symbol.

223
00:09:02.511 --> 00:09:05.135
In this case, the symbol of Osiris is what appears to be

224
00:09:05.135 --> 00:09:08.612
an antenna parked on top of a box

225
00:09:08.612 --> 00:09:11.844
that greatly resembles the biblical ark of the covenant.

226
00:09:11.844 --> 00:09:12.836
Okay?

227
00:09:12.836 --> 00:09:15.726
I'm thinking, "Okay, so Osiris isn't a man.

228
00:09:15.726 --> 00:09:18.094
"He's an instrument. He's a device.

229
00:09:18.094 --> 00:09:19.086
"What's going on here?"

230
00:09:19.086 --> 00:09:21.592
The analogy I make is to that of Les Paul,

231
00:09:21.592 --> 00:09:23.758
the famous guitarist who just recently passed.

232
00:09:23.758 --> 00:09:26.680
Les Paul is a man, but if you ask a guitar player,

233
00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.541
and I'm a guitar player, a Les Paul is an instrument.

234
00:09:30.541 --> 00:09:33.060
It's a device that makes music.

235
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.394
<v Regina>Or if you ask some, he's a god.</v>

236
00:09:34.394 --> 00:09:36.425
(laughing)

237
00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:38.703
<v ->Touche, right.</v>

238
00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:40.217
You see how that could come along.

239
00:09:40.217 --> 00:09:42.148
There might have been a guy Osiris,

240
00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:44.718
but he also operated, or was known,

241
00:09:44.718 --> 00:09:47.811
as an instrument as well.

242
00:09:47.811 --> 00:09:49.198
What does this instrument do?

243
00:09:49.198 --> 00:09:50.595
Ask the Egyptians.

244
00:09:50.595 --> 00:09:53.038
The Osiris device was a tower.

245
00:09:53.038 --> 00:09:55.864
It was the ladder or stairway to heaven.

246
00:09:55.864 --> 00:09:58.029
In fact, there are researchers like David Roll

247
00:09:58.029 --> 00:10:01.880
who think that Abydos itself was the Osiris tower,

248
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.432
could well be the original Tower of Babel, the ladder,

249
00:10:05.432 --> 00:10:08.567
tower, or stairway that reached into the heavens.

250
00:10:08.567 --> 00:10:11.607
Well, at Abydos in particular, you see on one wall

251
00:10:11.607 --> 00:10:14.647
the Osiris device, then on the opposite wall,

252
00:10:14.647 --> 00:10:16.396
you see another representation of it,

253
00:10:16.396 --> 00:10:18.849
but in this one, it's different.

254
00:10:18.849 --> 00:10:23.169
What is shows now is that same pillar, same platform,

255
00:10:23.169 --> 00:10:26.006
but now here's that U-shaped wormhole boat,

256
00:10:26.006 --> 00:10:27.628
the ark of the millions of years.

257
00:10:27.628 --> 00:10:30.369
Same pillar attached to it, but now you see

258
00:10:30.369 --> 00:10:34.475
the Pharaoh Sety has actually become that pillar.

259
00:10:34.475 --> 00:10:36.896
He has become Osiris.

260
00:10:36.896 --> 00:10:40.608
In the lore, Sety is an eternal being now.

261
00:10:40.608 --> 00:10:42.069
He is a light being.

262
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:44.928
He went through a process of transformation

263
00:10:44.928 --> 00:10:47.989
and now can toggle back and forth between the worlds.

264
00:10:47.989 --> 00:10:49.642
There's a very famous story, a book,

265
00:10:49.642 --> 00:10:52.010
called, "The Search For Omm Sety,"

266
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.007
that tells this story of how Sety became

267
00:10:55.007 --> 00:10:57.044
one of these transfigured beings and is able then

268
00:10:57.044 --> 00:10:59.807
to toggle back and forth between the worlds.

269
00:10:59.807 --> 00:11:02.548
When I look at that story and look at the device

270
00:11:02.548 --> 00:11:07.548
that shows Sety in this process of dematerialization --

271
00:11:07.732 --> 00:11:09.022
<v Regina>That's what it struck me as</v>

272
00:11:09.022 --> 00:11:11.539
when I looked at that head that you were speaking of.

273
00:11:11.539 --> 00:11:13.342
I looked at the blue area underneath.

274
00:11:13.342 --> 00:11:14.697
Those look like pixels.

275
00:11:14.697 --> 00:11:15.966
<v ->They look like pixels, yeah.</v>

276
00:11:15.966 --> 00:11:17.224
<v Regina>Like something that has broken up</v>

277
00:11:17.224 --> 00:11:18.430
or just recombined.

278
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.126
<v ->Exactly, exactly.</v>

279
00:11:20.126 --> 00:11:22.472
<v Regina>It's like, thousands of pieces in my own head</v>

280
00:11:22.472 --> 00:11:24.211
started flying together when you were

281
00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:25.555
showing this this morning.

282
00:11:25.555 --> 00:11:29.597
It was the way you put together the imagery,

283
00:11:29.597 --> 00:11:32.018
along with your own understanding of it,

284
00:11:32.018 --> 00:11:34.941
started creating whole new possibilities here.

285
00:11:34.941 --> 00:11:36.775
<v ->Yeah, and what I'm doing is just kind of taking</v>

286
00:11:36.775 --> 00:11:39.260
the Egyptian story at face value,

287
00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.789
and applying it to what they say happened to Sety.

288
00:11:41.789 --> 00:11:44.743
He now lives in the dimension of the blessed,

289
00:11:44.743 --> 00:11:46.620
as they call it, the field of eternity,

290
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.734
but he can toggle back and forth between the worlds.

291
00:11:49.734 --> 00:11:50.705
Well, that sounds familiar.

292
00:11:50.705 --> 00:11:53.724
Doesn't Jesus have that same capability?

293
00:11:53.724 --> 00:11:54.727
Certainly.

294
00:11:54.727 --> 00:11:56.859
<v Regina>And, "Anything I can do, you can do and more."</v>

295
00:11:56.859 --> 00:11:58.043
<v ->Exactly.</v>

296
00:11:58.043 --> 00:11:59.942
The difference between Sety and his story,

297
00:11:59.942 --> 00:12:02.267
and the story of Jesus, is that Sety actually

298
00:12:02.267 --> 00:12:05.659
left depictions on the wall, or his son, Ramses II,

299
00:12:05.659 --> 00:12:08.005
is probably the one who actually made the depictions

300
00:12:08.005 --> 00:12:10.160
showing what happened to his father.

301
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.805
This is how he did it and here it is.

302
00:12:12.805 --> 00:12:15.066
It looks to me like it's a teleportation device.

303
00:12:15.066 --> 00:12:16.410
That's the premise I operate on,

304
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.173
and on my tours, I've had physicists go along with me

305
00:12:19.173 --> 00:12:20.634
and they don't argue.

306
00:12:20.634 --> 00:12:23.215
"We see exactly what you're saying there,"

307
00:12:23.215 --> 00:12:26.575
that the Osiris tower is probably a particle accelerator

308
00:12:26.575 --> 00:12:28.484
that opens the wormhole, and then what you see

309
00:12:28.484 --> 00:12:30.543
on the opposite wall with the boat attached

310
00:12:30.543 --> 00:12:33.380
and Sety being dematerialized is he's going,

311
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.236
he's being transformed or transfigured

312
00:12:35.236 --> 00:12:37.998
preparatory to going through the wormhole.

313
00:12:37.998 --> 00:12:39.790
<v Regina>Now, what about these big light tubes</v>

314
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.902
that you find, those rays?

315
00:12:41.902 --> 00:12:43.182
<v ->Yeah, aren't those fascinating?</v>

316
00:12:43.182 --> 00:12:44.110
They're famous.

317
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.030
They're at Dendera, in the crypt at Dendera.

318
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.237
Dendera is known as the house of bread.

319
00:12:48.237 --> 00:12:51.096
It was brand new at the time of Jesus and Mary Magdalene.

320
00:12:51.096 --> 00:12:55.480
Brand new, and curiously, Mary Magdalene's a perfumer

321
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.666
and Dendera's a perfumery.

322
00:12:57.666 --> 00:12:59.127
You're thinking, okay, maybe these guys

323
00:12:59.127 --> 00:13:01.175
really were in Egypt as the Egyptian tradition

324
00:13:01.175 --> 00:13:03.724
suggests would have been there.

325
00:13:03.724 --> 00:13:06.903
The Dendera temple is built on a much older site,

326
00:13:06.903 --> 00:13:09.505
and this is why you have these lotus tubes,

327
00:13:09.505 --> 00:13:11.105
or light bulbs, as some people think,

328
00:13:11.105 --> 00:13:13.015
in the crypt of this temple.

329
00:13:13.015 --> 00:13:16.246
Of course, going back to Erich von Däniken and others

330
00:13:16.246 --> 00:13:19.233
that said, "Yeah, here's an ancient Egyptian example of --

331
00:13:19.233 --> 00:13:20.726
"They definitely had electricity.

332
00:13:20.726 --> 00:13:22.369
"These are cathode ray tubes.

333
00:13:22.369 --> 00:13:23.809
"This is showing us that they had

334
00:13:23.809 --> 00:13:25.259
"this advanced technology."

335
00:13:25.259 --> 00:13:27.606
What I saw that no one else has recorded,

336
00:13:27.606 --> 00:13:30.592
or documented anyway, is that when you look at the beings

337
00:13:30.592 --> 00:13:32.939
who were operating these tubes,

338
00:13:32.939 --> 00:13:35.498
they have a second body attached to them.

339
00:13:35.498 --> 00:13:37.098
<v Regina>I had never seen that or noticed it</v>

340
00:13:37.098 --> 00:13:40.138
in any of the hieroglyphics until you pointed that out.

341
00:13:40.138 --> 00:13:41.855
<v ->Everybody focuses on the tubes,</v>

342
00:13:41.855 --> 00:13:44.554
the gee whiz factor, "Look, they've got cathode ray tubes.

343
00:13:44.554 --> 00:13:45.962
"Those are plasma tubes.

344
00:13:45.962 --> 00:13:47.455
"Those are Crookes tubes," you know,

345
00:13:47.455 --> 00:13:49.172
William Crookes invented something like that.

346
00:13:49.172 --> 00:13:50.986
This is where we get the cathode ray technology.

347
00:13:50.986 --> 00:13:53.396
Our TV and computer screens were originally

348
00:13:53.396 --> 00:13:55.903
the cathode ray technology.

349
00:13:55.903 --> 00:13:59.273
Here we're saying they had electricity,

350
00:13:59.273 --> 00:14:01.204
and what I'm saying is, well, with the Crookes tube,

351
00:14:01.204 --> 00:14:03.635
when you follow that, this is how we discovered plasma,

352
00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:05.587
which is kind of like the most abundant

353
00:14:05.587 --> 00:14:07.422
substance in the universe.

354
00:14:07.422 --> 00:14:12.083
Here are these beings that have this second body

355
00:14:12.083 --> 00:14:15.827
attached to their skin, about an inch from their skin

356
00:14:15.827 --> 00:14:18.450
perfectly outlining or shadowing their bodies.

357
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:19.656
I'm wondering if those --

358
00:14:19.656 --> 00:14:20.797
<v Regina>Like a duplicate of themselves.</v>

359
00:14:20.797 --> 00:14:22.142
<v ->Like a duplicate of themselves.</v>

360
00:14:22.142 --> 00:14:23.442
As I've said in my presentation,

361
00:14:23.442 --> 00:14:25.511
this is either the one and only time the Egyptians

362
00:14:25.511 --> 00:14:26.994
made a huge mistake --

363
00:14:26.994 --> 00:14:27.858
<v Regina>I don't think so.</v>

364
00:14:27.858 --> 00:14:30.290
<v ->Don't think so, or their trying to tell us something here.</v>

365
00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:31.687
I think what they're trying to tell us is that

366
00:14:31.687 --> 00:14:34.983
these are plasma tubes and these are plasma beings

367
00:14:34.983 --> 00:14:37.137
that are operating these tubes,

368
00:14:37.137 --> 00:14:40.092
or that originally brought this technology here.

369
00:14:40.092 --> 00:14:42.578
<v Regina>Is there a crossover between this</v>

370
00:14:42.578 --> 00:14:45.126
and what we were just talking about a little bit ago

371
00:14:45.126 --> 00:14:47.792
when you were talking about moving between dimensions,

372
00:14:47.792 --> 00:14:50.469
as it were, to materialize, dematerialize,

373
00:14:50.469 --> 00:14:51.973
and re-materialize safely.

374
00:14:51.973 --> 00:14:54.277
Wouldn't a plasma state be part of this?

375
00:14:54.277 --> 00:14:56.485
<v ->Absolutely, and the connection here, the tie-in</v>

376
00:14:56.485 --> 00:14:58.341
is that when you look at the hieroglyph

377
00:14:58.341 --> 00:15:00.986
for the head of Osiris at Abydos,

378
00:15:00.986 --> 00:15:03.909
you have the two Tet pillars on either side,

379
00:15:03.909 --> 00:15:06.554
and those plasma tubes are held up by the Tet pillars,

380
00:15:06.554 --> 00:15:08.068
which are power pillars.

381
00:15:08.068 --> 00:15:11.897
They're essentially a stick with four cross bars

382
00:15:11.897 --> 00:15:14.031
attached to it.

383
00:15:14.031 --> 00:15:16.473
In the hieroglyph, you have the Tet pillars,

384
00:15:16.473 --> 00:15:17.774
and in between the two of them is this

385
00:15:17.774 --> 00:15:19.790
kind of phone booth looking hieroglyph --

386
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.230
<v Regina>(laughs) That's funny.</v>

387
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.254
We'll go into that.

388
00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:23.363
<v ->We'll go into that.</v>

389
00:15:23.363 --> 00:15:25.881
It's actually the Egyptian hieroglyph for sanctuary,

390
00:15:25.881 --> 00:15:28.664
or sacred space, and then right beside it

391
00:15:28.664 --> 00:15:30.734
is the head of Osiris.

392
00:15:30.734 --> 00:15:33.027
Now, the head of Osiris isn't the face of a man.

393
00:15:33.027 --> 00:15:35.096
The head of Osiris looks like sort of a stick

394
00:15:35.096 --> 00:15:38.882
with a mushroom cap on it, with a serpent levitating in it.

395
00:15:38.882 --> 00:15:40.642
This is a kit.

396
00:15:40.642 --> 00:15:44.055
When you take the pillar with the serpent levitating

397
00:15:44.055 --> 00:15:46.210
and put it on top of the phone booth glyph,

398
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.695
it forms the complete Osiris device.

399
00:15:48.695 --> 00:15:51.767
The box with the antenna, or perhaps particle accelerator,

400
00:15:51.767 --> 00:15:53.090
attached to it.

401
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:54.316
That's Osiris.

402
00:15:54.316 --> 00:15:56.012
<v Osiris>So, Osiris is an actual technology,</v>

403
00:15:56.012 --> 00:15:57.896
a technological device is what you're saying.

404
00:15:57.896 --> 00:15:59.261
<v ->Yes, it's a device.</v>

405
00:15:59.261 --> 00:16:00.467
It's a tool.

406
00:16:00.467 --> 00:16:01.608
It's a technology.

407
00:16:01.608 --> 00:16:03.276
It's also a symbol.

408
00:16:03.276 --> 00:16:06.582
The idea is that if you can decode this symbol,

409
00:16:06.582 --> 00:16:10.269
the geographical aspect of it in Egypt,

410
00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:14.002
the astronomical aspect of it, the anatomical,

411
00:16:14.002 --> 00:16:15.634
they interpret these symbols on six or seven

412
00:16:15.634 --> 00:16:18.418
different levels, then you become Osiris.

413
00:16:18.418 --> 00:16:21.457
Now you are capable of actually utilizing this technology.

414
00:16:21.457 --> 00:16:25.638
I think today, from our technological perspective,

415
00:16:25.638 --> 00:16:28.380
we can look at that and say, "Okay, this is a device.

416
00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.651
"This is something that we're building today."

417
00:16:30.651 --> 00:16:32.582
We're building these accelerators.

418
00:16:32.582 --> 00:16:34.673
<v Regina>But the only way we see it is in terms of</v>

419
00:16:34.673 --> 00:16:38.203
Hollywood depictions, black ops projects in the military,

420
00:16:38.203 --> 00:16:41.979
very aggressive hard technology applications.

421
00:16:41.979 --> 00:16:43.120
<v ->Exactly, I know.</v>

422
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.720
<v Regina>You're saying that's not what's going on.</v>

423
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.925
<v ->It drives me crazy.</v>

424
00:16:45.925 --> 00:16:48.944
My intuition, before I even went to Egypt

425
00:16:48.944 --> 00:16:50.576
and looked at that, and said, "You know what's interesting?"

426
00:16:50.576 --> 00:16:52.570
At the time, this goes back to the days

427
00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.287
with overhead projectors.

428
00:16:54.287 --> 00:16:56.218
Maybe we need to go back to those days, I don't know,

429
00:16:56.218 --> 00:16:58.255
but we used to have those, what is it?

430
00:16:58.255 --> 00:16:59.930
They weren't acetate, what were they?

431
00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.764
The transparencies.

432
00:17:01.764 --> 00:17:05.871
It just happened, sheer luck, sheer coincidence.

433
00:17:05.871 --> 00:17:09.296
I had this image of a meditating Buddha.

434
00:17:09.296 --> 00:17:11.621
He's sitting in a lotus position, and then suddenly

435
00:17:11.621 --> 00:17:16.036
my Osiris pill transparency slid on top of that.

436
00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:17.103
I was like, "Wait a minute,

437
00:17:17.103 --> 00:17:19.194
"the meditating Buddha and the Osiris pillar,

438
00:17:19.194 --> 00:17:21.721
"they match perfectly.

439
00:17:21.721 --> 00:17:24.399
"What if the pillar is our body?

440
00:17:24.399 --> 00:17:27.438
"What if it corresponds with our chakras?"

441
00:17:27.438 --> 00:17:28.921
Now, John West says the Egyptians

442
00:17:28.921 --> 00:17:31.086
had no concept of chakras, so you can't talk about

443
00:17:31.086 --> 00:17:33.795
chakras in ancient Egypt, but I'm not sure about that.

444
00:17:33.795 --> 00:17:34.703
<v Regina>We don't know that.</v>

445
00:17:34.703 --> 00:17:36.355
Just because we don't see those direct depictions

446
00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:37.955
doesn't mean that there was no knowledge of it.

447
00:17:37.955 --> 00:17:41.702
They may be being depicted in another way entirely

448
00:17:41.702 --> 00:17:43.301
that we haven't yet recognized as well.

449
00:17:43.301 --> 00:17:46.043
<v ->Right, so I went off on my happy trail, saying,</v>

450
00:17:46.043 --> 00:17:49.082
"Well, okay, we can't find the ark of the covenant.

451
00:17:49.082 --> 00:17:49.652
"Why not?"

452
00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:51.188
Well, maybe the reason why is because

453
00:17:51.188 --> 00:17:52.692
we're sitting on it all the time.

454
00:17:52.692 --> 00:17:55.348
What if the arc of the covenant is our first three chakras,

455
00:17:55.348 --> 00:17:57.641
and this pillar that's attached to it at Abydos,

456
00:17:57.641 --> 00:17:59.806
which they called the shuti pillar, by the way,

457
00:17:59.806 --> 00:18:01.246
or enlightenment pillar.

458
00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:03.262
What if that's our spinal cord system?

459
00:18:03.262 --> 00:18:05.417
What if the two tablets that sit up on top of it,

460
00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:08.648
what if that's the two hemispheres of our brain?

461
00:18:08.648 --> 00:18:11.806
Our body's the accelerator itself.

462
00:18:11.806 --> 00:18:15.005
<v Regina>It would seem more that that's --</v>

463
00:18:15.005 --> 00:18:17.213
That seems to me more to be the reality

464
00:18:17.213 --> 00:18:19.165
the more we understand and we each put

465
00:18:19.165 --> 00:18:20.786
pieces of the picture together.

466
00:18:20.786 --> 00:18:22.365
That makes more sense.

467
00:18:22.365 --> 00:18:25.277
<v ->Yeah, so you can imagine my shock when I go to Abydos,</v>

468
00:18:25.277 --> 00:18:28.338
into the Osiris sanctuary, and see the tower

469
00:18:28.338 --> 00:18:31.378
for the first time, the Osiris pillar or Osiris tower.

470
00:18:31.378 --> 00:18:33.255
Then on the opposite wall, lo and behold,

471
00:18:33.255 --> 00:18:36.252
there's Sety in the pillar, in the tower.

472
00:18:36.252 --> 00:18:38.087
He's become it.

473
00:18:38.087 --> 00:18:40.850
<v Regina>Exactly what your intuition was telling you.</v>

474
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.610
<v ->Exactly what my intuition was telling me.</v>

475
00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:45.213
It was like, "Wow, okay, that's powerful.

476
00:18:45.213 --> 00:18:46.215
"I've really got to --"

477
00:18:46.215 --> 00:18:48.444
I just kept on it and kept on it.

478
00:18:48.444 --> 00:18:50.162
It was a couple years later that I finally realized

479
00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:51.506
what we're talking about here is that

480
00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:53.297
this is a teleportation machine,

481
00:18:53.297 --> 00:18:55.132
and this is a dematerialization and then

482
00:18:55.132 --> 00:18:57.500
a re-materialization at another place.

483
00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.038
That's what we're talking about here.

484
00:18:59.038 --> 00:19:00.776
<v Regina>Now, again, speaking from</v>

485
00:19:00.776 --> 00:19:02.749
the humanistic, intuitive level,

486
00:19:02.749 --> 00:19:07.122
hundreds of thousands of people a year buy tickets

487
00:19:07.122 --> 00:19:10.164
to take tours in Egypt.

488
00:19:10.164 --> 00:19:14.644
Without understanding why, humanity is feeling a draw

489
00:19:14.644 --> 00:19:17.283
toward Egypt, and other places, but let's stick with this,

490
00:19:17.283 --> 00:19:20.088
because this is a really pronounced one, and the pyramids.

491
00:19:20.088 --> 00:19:23.502
There's something deeply intriguing to us.

492
00:19:23.502 --> 00:19:26.456
What are you beginning to discover?

493
00:19:26.456 --> 00:19:27.565
<v ->Well, first of all?</v>

494
00:19:27.565 --> 00:19:28.963
<v Regina>In terms of that relationship.</v>

495
00:19:28.963 --> 00:19:32.973
<v ->When I'm in Egypt and I look at the pyramids,</v>

496
00:19:32.973 --> 00:19:35.533
I think, "That's the real world."

497
00:19:35.533 --> 00:19:37.901
This, this hotel, this room,

498
00:19:37.901 --> 00:19:39.959
this won't be here 50 years from now.

499
00:19:39.959 --> 00:19:41.932
This is all totally transient.

500
00:19:41.932 --> 00:19:43.682
<v Regina>We have some people watching a football game.</v>

501
00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:45.580
That'll be over with in minutes. (laughs)

502
00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.467
<v ->Right, exactly.</v>

503
00:19:46.467 --> 00:19:50.360
You look at the pyramids, what 50,000 years old?

504
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.875
I mean, where do you want to go?

505
00:19:51.875 --> 00:19:54.563
<v Regina>John Anthony West says it could be 35,000 plus.</v>

506
00:19:54.563 --> 00:19:56.099
<v ->I think 35,000 plus.</v>

507
00:19:56.099 --> 00:19:58.893
You go to Egypt, you get a clear look.

508
00:19:58.893 --> 00:20:00.194
This is 2500 B.C.

509
00:20:00.194 --> 00:20:01.474
This is 1500 B.C.

510
00:20:01.474 --> 00:20:02.722
Then you work your way up to Giza

511
00:20:02.722 --> 00:20:04.119
and you look at that, and you're like,

512
00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:09.015
that's 35,000 to 50,000 easy, easy, easy.

513
00:20:09.015 --> 00:20:10.850
That's part of what the allure is, I think,

514
00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.111
is you know that's the real world

515
00:20:13.111 --> 00:20:16.151
and that's what you want to connect with, for one thing.

516
00:20:16.151 --> 00:20:19.372
Then the other is, Egypt just calls you too.

517
00:20:19.372 --> 00:20:21.558
Egypt works you.

518
00:20:21.558 --> 00:20:24.278
When I'm taking people to Egypt,

519
00:20:24.278 --> 00:20:27.318
I'm a servant of Egypt.

520
00:20:27.318 --> 00:20:29.313
I'm just helping to bring people there

521
00:20:29.313 --> 00:20:31.520
and Egypt does the rest.

522
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.590
I do my lectures, I do my workshops, and all that,

523
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:36.576
but that's kind of like the famous pea spitter in the wind.

524
00:20:36.576 --> 00:20:38.997
It's just nothing compared to what Egypt is capable of,

525
00:20:38.997 --> 00:20:40.480
the intelligence that's there.

526
00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.154
<v Regina>Everybody's journey is personal.</v>

527
00:20:42.154 --> 00:20:42.777
<v ->It is.</v>

528
00:20:42.777 --> 00:20:44.248
<v Regina>They're all going there for their own reasons,</v>

529
00:20:44.248 --> 00:20:46.776
and oftentimes, maybe a connection to some past knowledge

530
00:20:46.776 --> 00:20:49.402
that's stored within the human vehicle once again.

531
00:20:49.402 --> 00:20:50.799
<v ->It happens all the time.</v>

532
00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:51.887
Happens all the time.

533
00:20:51.887 --> 00:20:53.167
You'll be walking through the temple.

534
00:20:53.167 --> 00:20:55.322
All of the sudden you'll hear this, "Whoa!"

535
00:20:55.322 --> 00:20:56.282
It's happened to me.

536
00:20:56.282 --> 00:20:57.977
I've been walking along, all the sudden looked down,

537
00:20:57.977 --> 00:21:01.135
and I've got four feet. (laughing)

538
00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:02.681
<v Regina>Don't try to explain that one.</v>

539
00:21:02.681 --> 00:21:04.846
<v ->Yeah, why do I have these big red feet?</v>

540
00:21:04.846 --> 00:21:06.974
(laughing)

541
00:21:07.726 --> 00:21:09.838
<v Regina>So, is it fair to assume that there's something</v>

542
00:21:09.838 --> 00:21:11.993
of a multidimensional nature, or certainly

543
00:21:11.993 --> 00:21:14.062
beyond the time-space loop, within us

544
00:21:14.062 --> 00:21:16.782
that's connecting to that, but very specifically

545
00:21:16.782 --> 00:21:18.339
going back to the work that you were doing,

546
00:21:18.339 --> 00:21:21.933
the lecture this morning, the work you're doing right now.

547
00:21:21.933 --> 00:21:25.677
What is it that humanity is moving toward?

548
00:21:25.677 --> 00:21:26.573
Why now?

549
00:21:26.573 --> 00:21:27.810
Why are people like you putting

550
00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:29.335
all of these pieces together?

551
00:21:29.335 --> 00:21:31.991
What's coming up for us in your field of vision?

552
00:21:31.991 --> 00:21:34.658
<v ->Well, it could just be a completion of</v>

553
00:21:34.658 --> 00:21:36.930
the 26,000-year cosmic cycle.

554
00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:40.513
Now is the time for this knowledge to be brought forth.

555
00:21:40.513 --> 00:21:43.831
A certain segment of the people will latch onto it,

556
00:21:43.831 --> 00:21:45.366
might move forward into another realm.

557
00:21:45.366 --> 00:21:47.105
I think that's very possible.

558
00:21:47.105 --> 00:21:50.955
I'm also kind of, we'll call it alarmed.

559
00:21:50.955 --> 00:21:53.302
We're here in Silicon Valley right now.

560
00:21:53.302 --> 00:21:56.087
Bill Gates holds the patent on the human body

561
00:21:56.087 --> 00:21:57.580
as an electrical device.

562
00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.482
I know they've got plans to take my laptop computer,

563
00:22:00.482 --> 00:22:03.841
my iPhone, take it out of my hand and put it into my hand.

564
00:22:03.841 --> 00:22:05.537
In fact, they want to put it in my tooth,

565
00:22:05.537 --> 00:22:06.259
as a matter of fact.

566
00:22:06.259 --> 00:22:07.520
<v Regina>Right, we don't need that.</v>

567
00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.918
<v ->I don't think we need any of that.</v>

568
00:22:08.918 --> 00:22:11.467
There's a real race, I think, that some of us

569
00:22:11.467 --> 00:22:13.216
feel compelled to engage in right now

570
00:22:13.216 --> 00:22:15.605
to gather as much of this spiritual knowledge as possible,

571
00:22:15.605 --> 00:22:17.696
because my concern is is that once we become

572
00:22:17.696 --> 00:22:21.013
Borgs in that way, I'm not sure we're going to be

573
00:22:21.013 --> 00:22:23.402
able to work the transfiguration

574
00:22:23.402 --> 00:22:25.589
like we did in the ancient world,

575
00:22:25.589 --> 00:22:26.933
and up until this time.

576
00:22:26.933 --> 00:22:28.308
I've very concerned about that.

577
00:22:28.308 --> 00:22:30.932
I think, in a way, it's further imprisonment,

578
00:22:30.932 --> 00:22:31.890
and I think we're going to

579
00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:33.544
have to be very careful about that.

580
00:22:33.544 --> 00:22:34.728
<v Regina>Let's talk about that.</v>

581
00:22:34.728 --> 00:22:38.023
Do you feel that that is by design?

582
00:22:38.023 --> 00:22:39.143
<v ->Whose design?</v>

583
00:22:39.143 --> 00:22:41.458
It is be design, there's no question about it,

584
00:22:41.458 --> 00:22:42.855
but who's the designer?

585
00:22:42.855 --> 00:22:44.476
The ultimate creator of the universe?

586
00:22:44.476 --> 00:22:45.362
I don't think so.

587
00:22:45.362 --> 00:22:47.825
I think there's some intermediary force in there.

588
00:22:47.825 --> 00:22:49.329
I'm not sure if it's the grays.

589
00:22:49.329 --> 00:22:51.399
I'm not sure if it's some government entity.

590
00:22:51.399 --> 00:22:54.342
I'm not sure who it is, but it's clearly by design

591
00:22:54.342 --> 00:22:59.174
that they want to see us become one with the computer.

592
00:22:59.174 --> 00:23:00.411
That's the trend.

593
00:23:00.411 --> 00:23:02.214
They're taking the genetic technology,

594
00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:04.496
they're taking the nanotechnology,

595
00:23:04.496 --> 00:23:06.278
they're taking our neuroscience,

596
00:23:06.278 --> 00:23:09.328
and they're taking, ultimately, our --

597
00:23:09.328 --> 00:23:11.323
Well, we've got genes, computer bits,

598
00:23:11.323 --> 00:23:13.477
neurons, and atoms, and nanotechnology

599
00:23:13.477 --> 00:23:15.664
putting it all into one technology

600
00:23:15.664 --> 00:23:17.082
and putting it in our skin.

601
00:23:17.082 --> 00:23:20.399
That's, you know, not good.

602
00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:21.445
<v Regina>No, it's not good.</v>

603
00:23:21.445 --> 00:23:24.463
At the same time, you have this incredible awakening.

604
00:23:24.463 --> 00:23:25.321
You see it.

605
00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:27.433
Obviously, we have the luxury of going to

606
00:23:27.433 --> 00:23:28.746
conferences like this there where there are

607
00:23:28.746 --> 00:23:30.207
a lot of like-minded people.

608
00:23:30.207 --> 00:23:33.343
A relatively small percentage of the population, however.

609
00:23:33.343 --> 00:23:36.681
How do you take this highly esoteric knowledge,

610
00:23:36.681 --> 00:23:39.796
such as what you're able to bring forward in Egypt,

611
00:23:39.796 --> 00:23:44.426
and make it somehow known as an imperative for,

612
00:23:44.426 --> 00:23:46.538
if you want to get dramatic about it,

613
00:23:46.538 --> 00:23:49.279
our sovereignty, our human, mental,

614
00:23:49.279 --> 00:23:50.922
emotional, plasmic sovereignty?

615
00:23:50.922 --> 00:23:52.650
<v ->Right, that's what's at stake, without a doubt.</v>

616
00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:54.015
<v Regina>How do we translate this?</v>

617
00:23:54.015 --> 00:23:56.479
What is this headed toward?

618
00:23:56.479 --> 00:23:58.121
What can we do?

619
00:23:58.121 --> 00:23:59.241
<v ->Well, I don't know.</v>

620
00:23:59.241 --> 00:24:01.929
I've had this conversation several times this weekend.

621
00:24:01.929 --> 00:24:04.670
People coming up and saying, "What is it that's in me

622
00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:08.275
"that compels me to want to seek this knowledge?"

623
00:24:08.275 --> 00:24:10.569
I have friends and family that could care less about this,

624
00:24:10.569 --> 00:24:12.030
but there's something that's going off in me

625
00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:15.048
that's making me have to do this right now.

626
00:24:15.048 --> 00:24:17.299
They call it the factor.

627
00:24:17.299 --> 00:24:20.808
Some people have the factor, and others,

628
00:24:20.808 --> 00:24:23.186
it's maybe not for them at this time.

629
00:24:23.186 --> 00:24:24.786
I just kind of rely on that,

630
00:24:24.786 --> 00:24:28.989
that the people that want to move in this direction,

631
00:24:28.989 --> 00:24:30.802
that are feeling compelled, that have the factor,

632
00:24:30.802 --> 00:24:32.658
are going to more and more cluster,

633
00:24:32.658 --> 00:24:33.980
are going to need to communicate,

634
00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.794
are going to be able to cooperate with one another

635
00:24:35.794 --> 00:24:37.095
to move forward.

636
00:24:37.095 --> 00:24:39.687
Ultimately, it's for our own good as a species

637
00:24:39.687 --> 00:24:42.087
because the rest are just going to kind of, I feel like,

638
00:24:42.087 --> 00:24:45.468
go like lemmings right off the cliff.

639
00:24:45.468 --> 00:24:46.865
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

640
00:24:46.865 --> 00:24:51.227
As I speak to people, everyone's giving their

641
00:24:51.227 --> 00:24:54.578
kind of rendition of this awakening.

642
00:24:54.578 --> 00:24:57.479
We're looking at this whole date, 2012.

643
00:24:57.479 --> 00:24:58.482
It's a date.

644
00:24:58.482 --> 00:24:59.624
It's actually a cycle.

645
00:24:59.624 --> 00:25:00.408
<v ->I know.</v>

646
00:25:00.408 --> 00:25:01.763
<v Regina>It's a period of time.</v>

647
00:25:01.763 --> 00:25:03.064
We're saying 2012 very loosely.

648
00:25:03.064 --> 00:25:05.176
In other words, the period of time we're in.

649
00:25:05.176 --> 00:25:07.505
I'm beginning to think, and today really struck me

650
00:25:07.505 --> 00:25:11.069
listening to you, that we're actually

651
00:25:11.069 --> 00:25:15.452
starting to contemplate, individually and collectively,

652
00:25:15.452 --> 00:25:19.516
learning how to use these ancient technologies again

653
00:25:19.516 --> 00:25:21.350
in our physical realities.

654
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:25.137
Many people talk about this period of 2012,

655
00:25:25.137 --> 00:25:27.409
ascension, moving form the third, to the fourth,

656
00:25:27.409 --> 00:25:30.619
to the fifth dimensional fields and so forth.

657
00:25:30.619 --> 00:25:33.328
Do you think that this is a vehicle,

658
00:25:33.328 --> 00:25:36.485
this information you're discovering may be one

659
00:25:36.485 --> 00:25:39.418
of the vehicles to be able to move this direction?

660
00:25:39.418 --> 00:25:40.485
<v ->Oh, absolutely.</v>

661
00:25:40.485 --> 00:25:44.431
Today in my workshop, I cited the conversation,

662
00:25:44.431 --> 00:25:45.967
which I always love to do, between --

663
00:25:45.967 --> 00:25:47.242
<v Regina>Do share it because I wasn't there.</v>

664
00:25:47.242 --> 00:25:48.852
I want to hear it.

665
00:25:48.852 --> 00:25:52.055
<v ->It's a conversation between Steve Kroft and Bob Stanek.</v>

666
00:25:52.055 --> 00:25:53.687
Steve Kroft, of course, of 60 minutes.

667
00:25:53.687 --> 00:25:56.119
He got all alarmed when CERN was getting ready

668
00:25:56.119 --> 00:25:58.403
to be fired up last year, the particle accelerator there,

669
00:25:58.403 --> 00:25:59.780
creating the baby big bangs.

670
00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.552
Fear was it going to create a black hole that's going to

671
00:26:01.552 --> 00:26:03.451
swallow Geneva and eat the earth,

672
00:26:03.451 --> 00:26:04.827
all that kind of stuff.

673
00:26:04.827 --> 00:26:09.406
Steve Kroft goes over to CERN, sits down with Bob Stanek,

674
00:26:09.406 --> 00:26:13.427
a physicist from Fermilab in Chicago, or Batavia.

675
00:26:13.427 --> 00:26:15.283
Starts talking with him, saying, Steve Kroft's like,

676
00:26:15.283 --> 00:26:16.669
"What are you doing?

677
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:19.432
"Why are you guys creating these baby big bangs

678
00:26:19.432 --> 00:26:21.479
"and trying to recreate the conditions that existed

679
00:26:21.479 --> 00:26:23.527
"just after the big bang, and essentially

680
00:26:23.527 --> 00:26:25.447
"putting us all in jeopardy here?"

681
00:26:25.447 --> 00:26:28.423
Stanek's response is, he says, "Well, let me ask you this.

682
00:26:28.423 --> 00:26:32.604
"Just 30 years ago we learned about photons,

683
00:26:32.604 --> 00:26:34.481
"and we learned how to put them through

684
00:26:34.481 --> 00:26:36.103
"a television camera, and beam them into

685
00:26:36.103 --> 00:26:38.641
"mom and pop's living room, and that was really great."

686
00:26:38.641 --> 00:26:41.308
He says, "Imagine 10, 20 years from now tops,

687
00:26:41.308 --> 00:26:42.929
"that we'll not be able to take photons,

688
00:26:42.929 --> 00:26:44.977
"but we'll be able to take you and me

689
00:26:44.977 --> 00:26:47.419
"and put us in mom and pop's living room.

690
00:26:47.419 --> 00:26:50.752
"You tell me, is this worth it?"

691
00:26:51.645 --> 00:26:53.063
Steve Kroft is incredulous.

692
00:26:53.063 --> 00:26:55.730
He's saying, "You're talking about teleporting people?"

693
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:57.543
Stanek says, "Yeah."

694
00:26:57.543 --> 00:26:59.346
Kroft is like, "You really think you're

695
00:26:59.346 --> 00:27:00.650
"going to be able to do that?"

696
00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:02.367
Stanek's like, "Well, maybe I've said too much,

697
00:27:02.367 --> 00:27:04.362
"but the cat's already out of the bag."

698
00:27:04.362 --> 00:27:06.708
This is exactly where we're going with this.

699
00:27:06.708 --> 00:27:08.639
That's the next big breakthrough.

700
00:27:08.639 --> 00:27:11.007
The internet was one thing, but now they're talking

701
00:27:11.007 --> 00:27:14.889
about literally teleportation within 10 years.

702
00:27:14.889 --> 00:27:16.606
<v Regina>Yes, and I've heard very similar things</v>

703
00:27:16.606 --> 00:27:19.998
over the last 20 years, leading up to this period of time

704
00:27:19.998 --> 00:27:22.504
that we would be approaching right about now

705
00:27:22.504 --> 00:27:24.819
the period of time in which this would be possible.

706
00:27:24.819 --> 00:27:28.797
Some say, and again, some of the hidden technologies,

707
00:27:28.797 --> 00:27:30.877
some of the branches of military and such

708
00:27:30.877 --> 00:27:32.317
that we're not supposed to know about,

709
00:27:32.317 --> 00:27:34.290
that this has already been accomplished.

710
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:35.965
<v ->That's the take, that if they're talking about it</v>

711
00:27:35.965 --> 00:27:37.991
in the open literature on 60 minutes,

712
00:27:37.991 --> 00:27:39.591
that means we've had it for the past

713
00:27:39.591 --> 00:27:41.543
at least 30 years or so.

714
00:27:41.543 --> 00:27:43.580
It makes me wonder if we really do have that,

715
00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.298
but just imagine how dramatically

716
00:27:45.298 --> 00:27:48.572
that will change everything.

717
00:27:48.572 --> 00:27:51.079
Again, there's no spiritual component whatsoever

718
00:27:51.079 --> 00:27:52.263
to any of this.

719
00:27:52.263 --> 00:27:53.894
<v Regina>That's what I was just starting to say.</v>

720
00:27:53.894 --> 00:27:57.116
That's just pure technology, without any kind of override

721
00:27:57.116 --> 00:27:59.771
for, necessarily, the betterment of our own

722
00:27:59.771 --> 00:28:01.947
evolution as a species and so forth.

723
00:28:01.947 --> 00:28:03.505
What if you take that technology,

724
00:28:03.505 --> 00:28:05.104
and say the body is the vehicle,

725
00:28:05.104 --> 00:28:07.014
and you're using consciousness with it,

726
00:28:07.014 --> 00:28:11.589
what are you perceiving then as the higher agenda?

727
00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:13.957
<v ->The higher agenda, well, is just the awakening</v>

728
00:28:13.957 --> 00:28:16.325
that we are these inter-dimensional beings,

729
00:28:16.325 --> 00:28:18.992
and that we have, in fact, personal control of our bodies

730
00:28:18.992 --> 00:28:20.805
and we don't need to let a government,

731
00:28:20.805 --> 00:28:24.058
or a military, or a church come in and control

732
00:28:24.058 --> 00:28:27.279
and tell us what our body is really capable of doing.

733
00:28:27.279 --> 00:28:30.927
Once we recognize that, literally, the stars are the limit

734
00:28:30.927 --> 00:28:33.171
at that point.

735
00:28:33.529 --> 00:28:35.567
<v Regina>Okay, so let's say everybody</v>

736
00:28:35.567 --> 00:28:38.938
that's listening to this now is already on board.

737
00:28:38.938 --> 00:28:43.235
You're talking with a lot of people all the time.

738
00:28:43.235 --> 00:28:45.273
What's kind of the scuttle butt that you see

739
00:28:45.273 --> 00:28:50.273
as to some of the intended obstacles

740
00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:54.488
that will occur as we're trying to do this?

741
00:28:54.488 --> 00:28:56.205
<v ->Well, the first one is, "This is ridiculous.</v>

742
00:28:56.205 --> 00:28:57.603
"You can't do this."

743
00:28:57.603 --> 00:28:59.810
<v Regina>So mental is first, debunk it.</v>

744
00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:01.624
<v ->Yeah, yeah, it's total mental.</v>

745
00:29:01.624 --> 00:29:05.869
Then we've got to overcome the idea that

746
00:29:05.869 --> 00:29:08.279
the physical body is somehow dirty,

747
00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:11.191
or the Christian term is sinful and all of that.

748
00:29:11.191 --> 00:29:13.442
That's emotional and physical.

749
00:29:13.442 --> 00:29:15.479
We've got all of that working against us.

750
00:29:15.479 --> 00:29:17.569
Then, but what we really need are the targets

751
00:29:17.569 --> 00:29:20.387
that show us that this is actually how this can happen.

752
00:29:20.387 --> 00:29:22.424
I always refer people to a cartoon I saw once

753
00:29:22.424 --> 00:29:25.711
of a cocoon, or a butterfly, excuse me,

754
00:29:25.711 --> 00:29:27.332
a cocoon looking up at the butterfly, saying,

755
00:29:27.332 --> 00:29:29.426
"You'll never get me up in one of those things."

756
00:29:29.426 --> 00:29:30.631
(Regina laughing)

757
00:29:30.631 --> 00:29:32.210
That's where we're at.

758
00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:36.071
We don't have that butterfly to show us

759
00:29:36.071 --> 00:29:37.948
that this is where this is going.

760
00:29:37.948 --> 00:29:39.623
A lot of people recognize we're in a tremendous

761
00:29:39.623 --> 00:29:41.599
time of change and metamorphosis.

762
00:29:41.599 --> 00:29:43.785
Some are willing to go the bluetooth route,

763
00:29:43.785 --> 00:29:45.940
and turn themselves into Borgs.

764
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.382
That's one form of metamorphosis, for sure,

765
00:29:48.382 --> 00:29:50.003
but then others are saying, "No, I want to pull away

766
00:29:50.003 --> 00:29:51.422
"from that and I know I've got to develop

767
00:29:51.422 --> 00:29:53.321
"myself from within, but how do I do this?

768
00:29:53.321 --> 00:29:55.347
"Where do I go and where do I look?"

769
00:29:55.347 --> 00:29:57.459
That's what I've tried to do in my presentations

770
00:29:57.459 --> 00:29:59.688
like Morph, is to show throughout the ages,

771
00:29:59.688 --> 00:30:02.216
there are these various images of beings

772
00:30:02.216 --> 00:30:04.500
who have achieved this transcendent form,

773
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.708
this higher metamorphosis, and that's where

774
00:30:06.708 --> 00:30:09.097
we want to put our time, energy, and emotion.

775
00:30:09.097 --> 00:30:10.281
<v Regina>Let's talk about that,</v>

776
00:30:10.281 --> 00:30:11.582
a little historical context to that,

777
00:30:11.582 --> 00:30:14.089
because as you say, this notion of moving back

778
00:30:14.089 --> 00:30:17.224
towards star status or light status as beings

779
00:30:17.224 --> 00:30:19.038
has been around for many thousands of years,

780
00:30:19.038 --> 00:30:20.190
even documented.

781
00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:22.120
The story of Gilgamesh, let's talk about that.

782
00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.517
<v ->Yeah, one of my favorites.</v>

783
00:30:23.517 --> 00:30:25.043
The oldest human story.

784
00:30:25.043 --> 00:30:26.973
The story of a king who's told by a goddess

785
00:30:26.973 --> 00:30:30.408
that he's 2/3 divine and 1/3 human.

786
00:30:30.408 --> 00:30:31.474
That's his predicament.

787
00:30:31.474 --> 00:30:33.287
She's saying, "Look, if you want to join the gods,

788
00:30:33.287 --> 00:30:35.453
"if you want to literally go through the gate of the gods,

789
00:30:35.453 --> 00:30:38.076
"you're going to have to clean up your act."

790
00:30:38.076 --> 00:30:41.255
The way I interpret it is he needs to become 360.

791
00:30:41.255 --> 00:30:44.039
I like that because 360 is the symbol of the circle,

792
00:30:44.039 --> 00:30:47.239
it's the ring, it's the symbol of wholeness and completion.

793
00:30:47.239 --> 00:30:48.817
That's what we're all trying to get ahold of,

794
00:30:48.817 --> 00:30:51.494
is that sense of holiness, and wholeness, and completion

795
00:30:51.494 --> 00:30:55.025
to become 360 and literally get that ring

796
00:30:55.025 --> 00:30:57.254
of cosmic sovereignty that all the gods have.

797
00:30:57.254 --> 00:31:00.240
It literally is, seems to be the ring or vibration

798
00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.758
is the key element that we're all missing.

799
00:31:02.758 --> 00:31:05.605
We're all not playing with a full deck.

800
00:31:05.605 --> 00:31:08.443
None of our elevators go to the top.

801
00:31:08.443 --> 00:31:10.853
We've all got this candle for the body

802
00:31:10.853 --> 00:31:12.624
with the pineal gland as the wick,

803
00:31:12.624 --> 00:31:15.185
but none of our candles are lit.

804
00:31:15.185 --> 00:31:17.414
That's the essential predicament, so that's what

805
00:31:17.414 --> 00:31:19.313
we're all trying to learn how to do right now.

806
00:31:19.313 --> 00:31:22.097
As more and more embrace this knowledge,

807
00:31:22.097 --> 00:31:24.027
it's going to make it more and more possible

808
00:31:24.027 --> 00:31:25.819
for the rest of us to learn how to do it.

809
00:31:25.819 --> 00:31:27.046
<v Regina>That's a good point you bring up.</v>

810
00:31:27.046 --> 00:31:30.950
I've come into contact with a couple of different people.

811
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:34.405
One of them is Sai Maa, and Sai Maa has something called

812
00:31:34.405 --> 00:31:36.987
the Brain Illumination DVD.

813
00:31:36.987 --> 00:31:40.954
I found it very profound and impactful,

814
00:31:40.954 --> 00:31:44.015
because again, we seem to have a lot of different

815
00:31:44.015 --> 00:31:46.415
work in terms of human sovereignty

816
00:31:46.415 --> 00:31:49.295
coming back to these master glands,

817
00:31:49.295 --> 00:31:52.730
and the understanding of what these master glands are.

818
00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:55.471
Just to share with you a wee little story

819
00:31:55.471 --> 00:31:59.438
of a friend who's highly intuitive, had a dream one night,

820
00:31:59.438 --> 00:32:02.969
and was shown in this vision that when you look through,

821
00:32:02.969 --> 00:32:04.729
is it the queen's chamber?

822
00:32:04.729 --> 00:32:06.467
The one that goes on the equinox.

823
00:32:06.467 --> 00:32:08.078
it goes through and it shows --

824
00:32:08.078 --> 00:32:12.067
No, no, it's the temple that was moved

825
00:32:12.067 --> 00:32:13.294
because of the flooding.

826
00:32:13.294 --> 00:32:16.088
<v ->That'd be Philae, the Isis temple at Philae.</v>

827
00:32:16.088 --> 00:32:18.339
<v Regina>Where you can see the images of the three kings</v>

828
00:32:18.339 --> 00:32:21.005
up on the, it's either the solstice or equinox,

829
00:32:21.005 --> 00:32:22.520
I've forgotten which one now.

830
00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.856
But in any event, she was shown that those three kings

831
00:32:24.856 --> 00:32:26.373
were the three master glands.

832
00:32:26.373 --> 00:32:27.216
<v ->Oh, wow.</v>

833
00:32:27.216 --> 00:32:28.378
<v Regina>It was the light coming in</v>

834
00:32:28.378 --> 00:32:30.576
and hitting the glands that was the beginning,

835
00:32:30.576 --> 00:32:32.154
that was what we needed to recall

836
00:32:32.154 --> 00:32:33.647
in terms of our own awakening.

837
00:32:33.647 --> 00:32:35.269
Now, this gets into the Egyptians.

838
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:36.645
This gets into sun.

839
00:32:36.645 --> 00:32:38.407
This gets into sun-gazing and so forth.

840
00:32:38.407 --> 00:32:39.004
<v ->Right.</v>

841
00:32:39.004 --> 00:32:40.124
<v Regina>Do you know what I'm saying?</v>

842
00:32:40.124 --> 00:32:40.956
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

843
00:32:40.956 --> 00:32:42.673
<v Regina>What do you see as that connection,</v>

844
00:32:42.673 --> 00:32:44.785
you mentioned the pineal gland, in terms of our

845
00:32:44.785 --> 00:32:48.475
being able to move away from Borg status

846
00:32:48.475 --> 00:32:50.640
and go the other direction.

847
00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.454
What do you see as some kind of hands-on

848
00:32:52.454 --> 00:32:54.256
from your point of view?

849
00:32:54.256 --> 00:32:56.485
<v ->Well, get to know your dome.</v>

850
00:32:56.485 --> 00:32:57.669
Get to know your inner dome.

851
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:59.675
That's kind of the work I've been doing lately.

852
00:32:59.675 --> 00:33:01.509
My book, "Freedom's Gate," co-authored with

853
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:04.176
Dr. Mark Gray, who's a chiropractor up in Philadelphia.

854
00:33:04.176 --> 00:33:06.874
We decoded the dome of the U.S. Capitol.

855
00:33:06.874 --> 00:33:07.962
<v Regina>I want to talk to you about that too,</v>

856
00:33:07.962 --> 00:33:09.381
before we finish today.

857
00:33:09.381 --> 00:33:11.631
<v ->Yeah, and this kind of is the segue in a way,</v>

858
00:33:11.631 --> 00:33:14.159
because when you go into the dome of the Capitol,

859
00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:17.156
and by the way, dome is slang for the head,

860
00:33:17.156 --> 00:33:19.184
so recognize that the dome of the U.S. Capitol

861
00:33:19.184 --> 00:33:22.736
is, in fact, a symbol of the human head.

862
00:33:22.736 --> 00:33:25.659
You go into the dome, and in the center of the rotunda

863
00:33:25.659 --> 00:33:27.194
is this golden dot.

864
00:33:27.194 --> 00:33:29.562
It's about 12 inches in diameter.

865
00:33:29.562 --> 00:33:32.858
You look straight up and you see George Washingon

866
00:33:32.858 --> 00:33:36.036
enthroned on a rainbow in a heavenly scene

867
00:33:36.036 --> 00:33:38.660
in front of a sun gate.

868
00:33:39.805 --> 00:33:42.012
The message is, okay, you're in the dome.

869
00:33:42.012 --> 00:33:43.378
You're in the human head.

870
00:33:43.378 --> 00:33:45.095
I wonder what that golden dot in the center

871
00:33:45.095 --> 00:33:46.449
of the rotunda could be?

872
00:33:46.449 --> 00:33:48.488
Obviously, it's the pineal gland.

873
00:33:48.488 --> 00:33:52.017
What these master masons did is they created

874
00:33:52.017 --> 00:33:53.734
this analog of the human head in saying,

875
00:33:53.734 --> 00:33:56.593
"Okay, walk in this dome, stand on that dot,

876
00:33:56.593 --> 00:33:59.729
"and look up, and tune yourself in to the sun."

877
00:33:59.729 --> 00:34:02.534
You're literally looking up at an ascended being,

878
00:34:02.534 --> 00:34:04.251
George Washington, on the rainbow

879
00:34:04.251 --> 00:34:08.485
just the way Jesus is portrayed as a resurrected being

880
00:34:08.485 --> 00:34:10.427
enthroned on the rainbow, and the way that Tibetans

881
00:34:10.427 --> 00:34:12.986
who have achieved the great perfection or rainbow body.

882
00:34:12.986 --> 00:34:15.237
Same thing, exact same thing.

883
00:34:15.237 --> 00:34:17.541
What they're saying is is that the way to achieve

884
00:34:17.541 --> 00:34:21.743
true freedom and liberty is through your dome,

885
00:34:21.743 --> 00:34:22.735
through the head.

886
00:34:22.735 --> 00:34:23.780
Get to know those glands.

887
00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.594
Know what's going on in there,

888
00:34:25.594 --> 00:34:27.130
and then work the alchemy.

889
00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:28.911
The alchemy comes in that there's five deities

890
00:34:28.911 --> 00:34:31.887
that surround Washington, five gods.

891
00:34:31.887 --> 00:34:33.998
Those gods are Athena, goddess of wisdom,

892
00:34:33.998 --> 00:34:37.412
Poseidon, king of Atlantis, king of the waters,

893
00:34:37.412 --> 00:34:42.265
Mercury, god of divine travelers and divine magic.

894
00:34:42.265 --> 00:34:45.283
It's also Vulcan, god of smith-craft and alchemy,

895
00:34:45.283 --> 00:34:47.374
and Sirius, the goddess of earth.

896
00:34:47.374 --> 00:34:51.624
That's earth, air, fire, water, and spacetime, or ether.

897
00:34:51.624 --> 00:34:53.320
Those are the five elements, and that's what

898
00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.738
our body is composed of.

899
00:34:54.738 --> 00:34:57.799
They knew that in order to achieve true freedom

900
00:34:57.799 --> 00:35:01.138
and true liberty, sovereignty, we've got to

901
00:35:01.138 --> 00:35:03.506
enter into the temple of celestial liberty,

902
00:35:03.506 --> 00:35:05.948
which is what they originally called the U.S. Capitol,

903
00:35:05.948 --> 00:35:10.699
and go inside our head, and learn to make this work.

904
00:35:11.196 --> 00:35:14.236
<v Regina>That sounds really good, but most people think,</v>

905
00:35:14.236 --> 00:35:17.202
"How do I go inside my head and begin to make that work?"

906
00:35:17.202 --> 00:35:18.567
<v ->Yeah, right.</v>

907
00:35:18.567 --> 00:35:19.804
<v Regina>Actually, I have to say,</v>

908
00:35:19.804 --> 00:35:23.516
that DVD by Sai Maa's group, HumanityInUnity.org

909
00:35:23.516 --> 00:35:24.764
I think is the name of it.

910
00:35:24.764 --> 00:35:26.737
That actually is highly instructive.

911
00:35:26.737 --> 00:35:28.348
It's very, very clear.

912
00:35:28.348 --> 00:35:29.756
<v ->Yep, there you go.</v>

913
00:35:29.756 --> 00:35:30.876
<v Regina>There's one way.</v>

914
00:35:30.876 --> 00:35:32.849
That's a little tool people can use to begin,

915
00:35:32.849 --> 00:35:37.211
because again, we have been put into a dissonance,

916
00:35:37.211 --> 00:35:39.302
the way our brains are functioning now.

917
00:35:39.302 --> 00:35:40.955
<v ->Right, yep.</v>

918
00:35:40.955 --> 00:35:42.907
<v Regina>We've been disconnected from nature.</v>

919
00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:44.176
We're disconnected from sun.

920
00:35:44.176 --> 00:35:45.989
We're disconnected from our own thoughts.

921
00:35:45.989 --> 00:35:47.728
We don't even know which thoughts are ours

922
00:35:47.728 --> 00:35:49.445
and aren't ours, and are passing through

923
00:35:49.445 --> 00:35:53.253
from digital effects, and radio frequencies, and so forth.

924
00:35:53.253 --> 00:35:56.165
That reclaiming of the sovereignty of the mind

925
00:35:56.165 --> 00:36:00.506
is going to be, that's our next big challenge, isn't it?

926
00:36:00.506 --> 00:36:02.404
<v ->Yeah, the slogan that I have,</v>

927
00:36:02.404 --> 00:36:04.036
I put it on t-shirts for the book,

928
00:36:04.036 --> 00:36:05.818
is "Own the Dome."

929
00:36:05.818 --> 00:36:07.215
<v Regina>Own the dome. (laughing)</v>

930
00:36:07.215 --> 00:36:10.095
<v ->The message from the book is own your own dome,</v>

931
00:36:10.095 --> 00:36:11.620
own your own thoughts, but also, we've got to

932
00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:12.942
get the dome back.

933
00:36:12.942 --> 00:36:14.692
Dick Durbin, senator from Illinois said

934
00:36:14.692 --> 00:36:16.899
the bankers own the place.

935
00:36:16.899 --> 00:36:18.777
We've got to take back that dome.

936
00:36:18.777 --> 00:36:20.494
<v Regina>This really feeds into a lot of levels</v>

937
00:36:20.494 --> 00:36:22.190
because we're looking at fear.

938
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:24.440
Fear controls the dome faster than anything.

939
00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.766
If you can keep people in fear of either

940
00:36:26.766 --> 00:36:30.296
aging, dying, losing their money,

941
00:36:30.296 --> 00:36:32.312
friends, security, and so forth,

942
00:36:32.312 --> 00:36:33.848
the dome isn't yours anymore.

943
00:36:33.848 --> 00:36:35.149
<v ->Right, exactly.</v>

944
00:36:35.149 --> 00:36:36.909
<v Regina>We have to take it back, even if we're under</v>

945
00:36:36.909 --> 00:36:40.813
what would be considered more challenging situations.

946
00:36:40.813 --> 00:36:42.178
<v ->Sure, absolutely.</v>

947
00:36:42.178 --> 00:36:43.916
I'm glad there are people like Sai Maa out there

948
00:36:43.916 --> 00:36:45.943
that are doing this work, because I consider myself

949
00:36:45.943 --> 00:36:48.769
sort of a person who's pointing people towards the door.

950
00:36:48.769 --> 00:36:50.465
There are people like her and others that are

951
00:36:50.465 --> 00:36:53.676
better qualified to take people through the door.

952
00:36:53.676 --> 00:36:55.297
<v Regina>But you're discovering that the doors</v>

953
00:36:55.297 --> 00:36:57.430
have been there all along, that's what's interesting

954
00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:01.377
in your work is because you can take the spiritual

955
00:37:01.377 --> 00:37:04.513
implications of it and overlay it with your discoveries

956
00:37:04.513 --> 00:37:07.232
archeologically, and then taking it into, as I say,

957
00:37:07.232 --> 00:37:09.344
the study of astrophysics and so forth.

958
00:37:09.344 --> 00:37:11.531
You have a really beautiful mind for

959
00:37:11.531 --> 00:37:13.685
connecting the dots, as it were.

960
00:37:13.685 --> 00:37:14.709
<v ->Thank you.</v>

961
00:37:14.709 --> 00:37:15.893
It's fun.

962
00:37:15.893 --> 00:37:18.816
<v Regina>It is fun, that's why I love chatting with you.</v>

963
00:37:18.816 --> 00:37:21.535
Would you mind giving us a little more information

964
00:37:21.535 --> 00:37:23.295
on "Freedom's Gate" and some of the other

965
00:37:23.295 --> 00:37:25.449
discoveries in this book?

966
00:37:25.449 --> 00:37:26.687
This is fascinating.

967
00:37:26.687 --> 00:37:28.760
<v ->Yeah, the book is "Freedom's Gate,</v>

968
00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.637
"The Lost Symbols in the U.S. Capitol,"

969
00:37:30.637 --> 00:37:32.568
co-authored with Dr. Mark Gray.

970
00:37:32.568 --> 00:37:34.349
Again, he's a chiropractor in Philadelphia

971
00:37:34.349 --> 00:37:36.557
who started coming out to my presentations a few years ago

972
00:37:36.557 --> 00:37:38.828
and ordered my books, and next thing you know,

973
00:37:38.828 --> 00:37:40.716
we're working on this together.

974
00:37:40.716 --> 00:37:43.031
What we did for the first time is really look

975
00:37:43.031 --> 00:37:45.889
at the symbolism, not only in the Capitol,

976
00:37:45.889 --> 00:37:48.673
but also of George Washington here.

977
00:37:48.673 --> 00:37:51.489
<v Regina>Yeah, what was up with George Washington?</v>

978
00:37:51.489 --> 00:37:54.294
<v ->Well, the thing is is that he was kind of</v>

979
00:37:54.294 --> 00:37:56.171
a reluctant Christ in a way.

980
00:37:56.171 --> 00:38:01.171
During his life, he was revered as this great man.

981
00:38:01.419 --> 00:38:04.534
Immediately after his death, the deification process

982
00:38:04.534 --> 00:38:07.904
began the day he died, literally.

983
00:38:07.904 --> 00:38:10.613
They literally tried to bring him back from the dead.

984
00:38:10.613 --> 00:38:12.597
William Thornton was the doctor who they had

985
00:38:12.597 --> 00:38:14.336
taken a bunch of blood out of him,

986
00:38:14.336 --> 00:38:16.053
and he died of a cold of course,

987
00:38:16.053 --> 00:38:18.283
and blood-letting was one of their cures.

988
00:38:18.283 --> 00:38:20.138
They brought some lambs blood in

989
00:38:20.138 --> 00:38:22.047
and thought they could just pump the lamb's blood

990
00:38:22.047 --> 00:38:24.458
back in him and bring him back to life.

991
00:38:24.458 --> 00:38:27.081
It sounds crazy to us, but immediately after that

992
00:38:27.081 --> 00:38:28.521
you start seeing these images.

993
00:38:28.521 --> 00:38:30.751
This is a favorite on here, look at this,

994
00:38:30.751 --> 00:38:34.110
of Washington being taken through the sun gate by angels.

995
00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:35.369
<v Regina>Oh yes, yes.</v>

996
00:38:35.369 --> 00:38:38.643
He is, he's a deity.

997
00:38:38.643 --> 00:38:40.595
<v ->He is a deity, and then same thing here</v>

998
00:38:40.595 --> 00:38:43.891
where angels are taking him up through the portal.

999
00:38:43.891 --> 00:38:46.750
People are like, "Well, Washington wasn't thought of

1000
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:48.115
"as a deity."

1001
00:38:48.115 --> 00:38:50.141
Well, not in our time, not in the history books

1002
00:38:50.141 --> 00:38:52.251
that we've been reading in the 20th Century.

1003
00:38:52.251 --> 00:38:53.296
<v Regina>Yes, this is a whole different</v>

1004
00:38:53.296 --> 00:38:54.696
depiction of Washington.

1005
00:38:54.696 --> 00:38:55.486
<v ->Right.</v>

1006
00:38:55.486 --> 00:38:56.947
<v Regina>What have you learned about him</v>

1007
00:38:56.947 --> 00:38:58.078
and in terms of the day, what was understood

1008
00:38:58.078 --> 00:38:59.773
about him of the day?

1009
00:38:59.773 --> 00:39:02.003
<v ->Well, that he was literally this --</v>

1010
00:39:02.003 --> 00:39:04.328
The analogy that I make is that

1011
00:39:04.328 --> 00:39:08.018
Washington was sort of the contemporary Alexander the Great.

1012
00:39:08.018 --> 00:39:09.757
Alexander was deified in his time.

1013
00:39:09.757 --> 00:39:12.669
He was apotheosized, which means to make a deity.

1014
00:39:12.669 --> 00:39:15.004
I think that's exactly how they viewed Washington, is

1015
00:39:15.004 --> 00:39:17.287
he was another Alexander.

1016
00:39:17.287 --> 00:39:20.465
He was also considered by the freemasons

1017
00:39:20.465 --> 00:39:22.876
a highly attuned spiritual being.

1018
00:39:22.876 --> 00:39:27.825
There was this process that Jesus underwent as well,

1019
00:39:27.825 --> 00:39:30.353
the historical Jesus leaves and here comes

1020
00:39:30.353 --> 00:39:33.190
the religious version of Jesus.

1021
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:34.833
This is what's happened with Washington,

1022
00:39:34.833 --> 00:39:36.838
is that we've watched over the past couple hundred years

1023
00:39:36.838 --> 00:39:40.155
that he has slowly but surely been deified.

1024
00:39:40.155 --> 00:39:43.847
It's an intentional process, until you finally find him

1025
00:39:43.847 --> 00:39:47.302
in the dome of the U.S. Capitol, sitting on a rainbow,

1026
00:39:47.302 --> 00:39:50.417
surrounded by heavenly beings,

1027
00:39:50.417 --> 00:39:54.481
as literally an American Christ.

1028
00:39:54.481 --> 00:39:56.262
That's the message that we find.

1029
00:39:56.262 --> 00:39:58.630
<v Regina>You're finding the same kind of geometry</v>

1030
00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.443
throughout the book as well that you would find

1031
00:40:00.443 --> 00:40:02.907
in a lot of sacred sites around the world.

1032
00:40:02.907 --> 00:40:05.296
<v ->That's exactly right and that's one of the things.</v>

1033
00:40:05.296 --> 00:40:08.058
We, through the process of researching this,

1034
00:40:08.058 --> 00:40:10.085
made half a dozen trips up to the Capitol

1035
00:40:10.085 --> 00:40:12.101
and talked with Dr. Barbara Wolanin,

1036
00:40:12.101 --> 00:40:14.149
who's the curator of the Capitol.

1037
00:40:14.149 --> 00:40:15.631
She's like, "This is all new.

1038
00:40:15.631 --> 00:40:17.604
"We've never seen any of this before."

1039
00:40:17.604 --> 00:40:19.951
Until it finally culminates where we show

1040
00:40:19.951 --> 00:40:24.951
the actual sacred geometry that is in that dome,

1041
00:40:25.241 --> 00:40:28.356
where all of the elements are portrayed.

1042
00:40:28.356 --> 00:40:29.774
You've got the pentacle.

1043
00:40:29.774 --> 00:40:32.814
You've got the whole story, until the ultimate reveal

1044
00:40:32.814 --> 00:40:36.462
that we find here, the ultimate geometry that's in here

1045
00:40:36.462 --> 00:40:38.617
is actually Metatron's Cube.

1046
00:40:38.617 --> 00:40:40.291
<v Regina>Oh my gosh, yes, look at that.</v>

1047
00:40:40.291 --> 00:40:42.639
<v ->Yeah, Metatron, of course, was Enoch</v>

1048
00:40:42.639 --> 00:40:45.444
in the pre-flood world, maybe even the Atlantian world.

1049
00:40:45.444 --> 00:40:48.399
He's a guy that accumulated all this sacred lore,

1050
00:40:48.399 --> 00:40:50.692
gets the attention of the heavenly beings,

1051
00:40:50.692 --> 00:40:53.668
they bring him up to heaven and give him a job.

1052
00:40:53.668 --> 00:40:56.196
They said, "Look, you've accumulated all this lore.

1053
00:40:56.196 --> 00:40:58.073
"We're going to interview you, see if your going to be

1054
00:40:58.073 --> 00:41:00.281
"good enough to go work up on this level."

1055
00:41:00.281 --> 00:41:01.625
Turns out he is.

1056
00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:03.694
At first, he's a janitor.

1057
00:41:03.694 --> 00:41:05.710
He cleans up around the throne of God.

1058
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:08.803
Does that for a while, then he becomes a guide, literally,

1059
00:41:08.803 --> 00:41:11.171
between the earthly and heavenly worlds.

1060
00:41:11.171 --> 00:41:13.891
When Fibonacci, who discovered the Metatron's Cube,

1061
00:41:13.891 --> 00:41:15.928
discovered it, he thought of it literally

1062
00:41:15.928 --> 00:41:17.784
as a gateway to heaven.

1063
00:41:17.784 --> 00:41:21.090
Maybe that's why that geometry is there,

1064
00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:23.405
because literally the dome of the capital

1065
00:41:23.405 --> 00:41:24.823
is that gateway.

1066
00:41:24.823 --> 00:41:26.797
The dome is our head, and what we need to learn to do

1067
00:41:26.797 --> 00:41:28.962
is alter our consciousness, become aware

1068
00:41:28.962 --> 00:41:31.394
of these other dimensions, parallel realities,

1069
00:41:31.394 --> 00:41:33.527
and then tune ourselves into those worlds.

1070
00:41:33.527 --> 00:41:35.852
Then what we've got to do, ultimately, then,

1071
00:41:35.852 --> 00:41:37.985
I believe, is open up the pineal gland,

1072
00:41:37.985 --> 00:41:40.129
allow it to release the secretions that contain

1073
00:41:40.129 --> 00:41:43.052
the further secrets that being to transmute our bodies,

1074
00:41:43.052 --> 00:41:46.209
and that's as far as we need to go in this realm.

1075
00:41:46.209 --> 00:41:48.481
I think a lot of people are close to that.

1076
00:41:48.481 --> 00:41:50.368
<v Regina>Is that why you called it "Freedom's Gate"?</v>

1077
00:41:50.368 --> 00:41:52.384
<v ->We called it "Freedom's Gate" because it is</v>

1078
00:41:52.384 --> 00:41:53.963
the gateway to freedom, but also because

1079
00:41:53.963 --> 00:41:57.355
the goddess freedom tops the dome of the Capitol.

1080
00:41:57.355 --> 00:42:00.074
<v Regina>Okay, so that last bit you said,</v>

1081
00:42:00.074 --> 00:42:02.212
I think that's kind of the crux of it, isn't it?

1082
00:42:02.212 --> 00:42:03.098
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1083
00:42:03.098 --> 00:42:04.953
<v Regina>You feel a lot of people really are approaching</v>

1084
00:42:04.953 --> 00:42:06.553
this level right now?

1085
00:42:06.553 --> 00:42:07.460
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1086
00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.337
That's why people are so compelled to absorb

1087
00:42:09.337 --> 00:42:11.310
as much of this legend and lore as possible,

1088
00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:13.241
because the ancients were clear in the stories

1089
00:42:13.241 --> 00:42:17.283
of the prophets, like Enoch, and Elijah, and others,

1090
00:42:17.283 --> 00:42:19.875
that the reason they did all this research

1091
00:42:19.875 --> 00:42:21.741
is they had hoped to attract the attention

1092
00:42:21.741 --> 00:42:24.706
of these higher beings who would literally interview them.

1093
00:42:24.706 --> 00:42:26.498
Which means go into their consciousness,

1094
00:42:26.498 --> 00:42:28.984
take a look around, "Hey, how's things going?

1095
00:42:28.984 --> 00:42:30.007
"What are you thinking about?

1096
00:42:30.007 --> 00:42:31.725
"Do you know what a star gate is?

1097
00:42:31.725 --> 00:42:32.791
"Do you know what a wormhole is?

1098
00:42:32.791 --> 00:42:35.202
"Are you familiar with the process of ascension?"

1099
00:42:35.202 --> 00:42:38.615
If so, that's the graduation from earth life right there.

1100
00:42:38.615 --> 00:42:41.377
That's all we need to know right there.

1101
00:42:41.377 --> 00:42:44.161
Then there are beings, guides, the ancients assure us

1102
00:42:44.161 --> 00:42:47.862
that are prepared to help us to get through that gateway.

1103
00:42:47.862 --> 00:42:49.740
That's what it's all about.

1104
00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:50.849
<v Regina>You're an optimist.</v>

1105
00:42:50.849 --> 00:42:52.398
<v ->Oh yeah, absolutely.</v>

1106
00:42:52.398 --> 00:42:55.459
Absolutely, but I'm also one of those that's feeling

1107
00:42:55.459 --> 00:42:58.127
very compelled right now to spend as much time as I can

1108
00:42:58.127 --> 00:43:00.899
accumulating as much of this knowledge as possible.

1109
00:43:00.899 --> 00:43:01.944
<v Regina>Exactly.</v>

1110
00:43:01.944 --> 00:43:03.054
<v ->Because I know it can --</v>

1111
00:43:03.054 --> 00:43:04.355
They're talking about a kill switch

1112
00:43:04.355 --> 00:43:05.699
for the internet, right now.

1113
00:43:05.699 --> 00:43:07.864
Giving the president the kill switch to the internet.

1114
00:43:07.864 --> 00:43:09.762
Maybe there's a kill switch for human consciousness

1115
00:43:09.762 --> 00:43:11.225
we don't know about yet.

1116
00:43:11.225 --> 00:43:13.250
Who knows if they dropped something like that

1117
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:14.946
but it's possible.

1118
00:43:14.946 --> 00:43:17.773
<v Regina>For yourself, what are you focusing on?</v>

1119
00:43:17.773 --> 00:43:20.023
Individually, as you say, gathering as much information,

1120
00:43:20.023 --> 00:43:23.159
but functionally speaking, to fire this puppy up

1121
00:43:23.159 --> 00:43:25.153
(laughing)

1122
00:43:25.153 --> 00:43:29.100
and utilize it, as it were, what are you doing?

1123
00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:33.025
<v ->Well, you know, that's my next project actually.</v>

1124
00:43:33.025 --> 00:43:36.235
I have a good friend that's a postal worker,

1125
00:43:36.235 --> 00:43:38.390
a clerk at my post office, and I go in there every day

1126
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:39.691
and we talk about this.

1127
00:43:39.691 --> 00:43:42.945
I came in one day with my DVD, a new DVD,

1128
00:43:42.945 --> 00:43:46.656
"The Light Body Effect," and he said, "Is that a diet?"

1129
00:43:46.656 --> 00:43:47.936
(Regina laughing)

1130
00:43:47.936 --> 00:43:51.466
I said, "No, it's about the light body and transfiguration."

1131
00:43:51.466 --> 00:43:52.970
I got to thinking, "Yeah, it is really kind of

1132
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:54.784
"a good idea for a diet."

1133
00:43:54.784 --> 00:43:59.423
What I'm working on now is 360 keys

1134
00:43:59.423 --> 00:44:02.122
for becoming more whole, holy, and complete,

1135
00:44:02.122 --> 00:44:03.263
and assembling those.

1136
00:44:03.263 --> 00:44:04.746
What started happening is that,

1137
00:44:04.746 --> 00:44:08.041
I had various life coaches and physical trainers

1138
00:44:08.041 --> 00:44:09.695
that tell me, for example,

1139
00:44:09.695 --> 00:44:12.096
one woman in the valley of southern California,

1140
00:44:12.096 --> 00:44:14.656
that she has a boot camp.

1141
00:44:14.656 --> 00:44:17.397
Brings people into her home, they spend a week with her,

1142
00:44:17.397 --> 00:44:18.645
she amps them up.

1143
00:44:18.645 --> 00:44:20.757
Gives them all the tools and techniques they need.

1144
00:44:20.757 --> 00:44:22.314
While they're on the exercise bike,

1145
00:44:22.314 --> 00:44:24.362
she's got them watching my DVDs.

1146
00:44:24.362 --> 00:44:26.420
She said, "I just want people to see these images

1147
00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:28.842
"of the light body, because it really feeds their spirit."

1148
00:44:28.842 --> 00:44:30.441
<v Regina>What a great way to do it.</v>

1149
00:44:30.441 --> 00:44:31.135
<v ->I know it.</v>

1150
00:44:31.135 --> 00:44:32.393
<v Regina>Because they're mind is in</v>

1151
00:44:32.393 --> 00:44:34.804
a completely different state because the body is moving.

1152
00:44:34.804 --> 00:44:36.873
Interesting, it becomes a meditation.

1153
00:44:36.873 --> 00:44:38.559
<v ->Right, and then she started talking about</v>

1154
00:44:38.559 --> 00:44:41.343
the diet that they use, and how feeding the photons

1155
00:44:41.343 --> 00:44:44.756
through your diet actually helps to build the light body.

1156
00:44:44.756 --> 00:44:47.031
I'm finding I've got half a dozen people that are out there,

1157
00:44:47.031 --> 00:44:49.047
professionals, that are using my DVDs

1158
00:44:49.047 --> 00:44:51.042
in their practices in various ways.

1159
00:44:51.042 --> 00:44:52.908
I'm starting to accumulate all the ways

1160
00:44:52.908 --> 00:44:54.018
that they're using it.

1161
00:44:54.018 --> 00:44:55.459
I'm going to put all that together in a book

1162
00:44:55.459 --> 00:44:57.592
or DVD project, that's what I'm working on right now.

1163
00:44:57.592 --> 00:44:58.936
<v Regina>Well, when will it be done?</v>

1164
00:44:58.936 --> 00:44:59.747
<v ->Spring.</v>

1165
00:44:59.747 --> 00:45:00.771
<v Regina>Spring, okay.</v>

1166
00:45:00.771 --> 00:45:01.912
<v ->Spring of 2010.</v>

1167
00:45:01.912 --> 00:45:03.469
<v Regina>Okay, so we're only a few months away.</v>

1168
00:45:03.469 --> 00:45:04.461
I can't wait to see it.

1169
00:45:04.461 --> 00:45:07.021
<v ->I know who I want to talk with about diet too.</v>

1170
00:45:07.021 --> 00:45:08.759
<v Regina>Okay. (laughing)</v>

1171
00:45:08.759 --> 00:45:10.178
<v ->Hit you up for some recipes.</v>

1172
00:45:10.178 --> 00:45:11.106
<v Regina>There you go.</v>

1173
00:45:11.106 --> 00:45:13.634
I'll help you out with those photon-oriented recipes.

1174
00:45:13.634 --> 00:45:14.796
<v ->Right. (laughing)</v>

1175
00:45:14.796 --> 00:45:16.727
<v Regina>Well, William, it's been an absolute pleasure</v>

1176
00:45:16.727 --> 00:45:17.875
speaking with you again.

1177
00:45:17.875 --> 00:45:18.900
<v ->Likewise, thank you.</v>

1178
00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:20.318
<v Regina>Then hopefully we'll catch up with you</v>

1179
00:45:20.318 --> 00:45:21.619
in another six months, once the book's out

1180
00:45:21.619 --> 00:45:22.760
in the springtime.

1181
00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:23.891
<v ->You've got it.</v>

1182
00:45:23.891 --> 00:45:25.192
<v Regina>And keep on this.</v>

1183
00:45:25.192 --> 00:45:26.472
I think it's really important.

1184
00:45:26.472 --> 00:45:28.978
So many people, I agree with you, are so close.

1185
00:45:28.978 --> 00:45:30.632
We can feel something's different.

1186
00:45:30.632 --> 00:45:34.652
We can feel that brass ring, like we could grab it --

1187
00:45:34.652 --> 00:45:35.867
<v ->The golden ring. (laughing)</v>

1188
00:45:35.867 --> 00:45:37.073
<v Regina>Golden ring.</v>

1189
00:45:37.073 --> 00:45:39.835
We can grab that golden ring, we're just so close.

1190
00:45:39.835 --> 00:45:42.523
It's just these little defining moments of awareness.

1191
00:45:42.523 --> 00:45:43.643
<v ->That's right.</v>

1192
00:45:43.643 --> 00:45:45.104
<v Regina>We just have to keep talking.</v>

1193
00:45:45.104 --> 00:45:46.470
<v ->You got it, look forward to it.</v>

1194
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:47.451
Thank you.

1195
00:45:50.373 --> 00:45:51.866
<v ->To delve further into William's work</v>

1196
00:45:51.866 --> 00:45:53.808
on "Freedom's Gate," you can hear that

1197
00:45:53.808 --> 00:45:55.600
on September's Regina's Cantina,

1198
00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.021
where we go into great depth in my radio show.

1199
00:45:58.021 --> 00:46:00.431
Meanwhile, you can also check into William's work

1200
00:46:00.431 --> 00:46:03.471
by following his website, WilliamHenry.net.

1201
00:46:03.471 --> 00:46:06.676
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1202
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:10.424
(gentle electronic music playing)
