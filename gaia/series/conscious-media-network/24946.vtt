00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>>With the price of energy and
gas inching skyward by the day,

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.600 align:middle line:84%
it seems that we're
finally motivated

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.620 align:middle line:84%
to look at the
alternatives, as witnessed

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.900 align:middle line:84%
by the six-month to one
year wait for hybrid cars.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, some people have
been ahead of the game, decades

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:14.980 align:middle line:90%
ahead.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Reinhold Ziegler is
one of those people

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.000 align:middle line:84%
who has made it
his life to develop

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.720 align:middle line:84%
non-polluting renewable energy
sources for both domestic use

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.560 align:middle line:90%
and abroad.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.570 align:middle line:84%
As you'll learn, the US
is way behind the curve

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.780 align:middle line:84%
because it seems that we only
respond to crisis before we're

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.010 align:middle line:90%
willing to change.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.670 align:middle line:90%
But better late than never.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:43.290 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.430 align:middle line:84%
Let's begin with talking
to you a little bit

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.310 align:middle line:84%
about your historical
path that has gotten you

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.304 align:middle line:84%
to this point of becoming
a renewable energy expert.

00:00:53.304 --> 00:00:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hm.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, essentially it
started for me-- I

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:05.190 align:middle line:84%
was a science major, physics
engineering major in college,

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.690 align:middle line:84%
and I really couldn't quite
figure out at the time

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.580 align:middle line:84%
why I was solving
all these problems.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.350 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like I was the biggest
problem that I had to work on.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So we did a lot of initial work
with conventional engineering

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.220 align:middle line:84%
projects, and then I met a
group of people in Berkeley

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and we began to put together
the first Integral Urban House.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.220 align:middle line:84%
This is the Farallones
Institute 1976, '77.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And so we put together a
house that was completely

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.240 align:middle line:90%
powered by the sun the wind.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.867 align:middle line:84%
And we had a beehive
in the building

00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:49.200 align:middle line:84%
that the bees would fly out
to the rest of neighborhood,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.935 align:middle line:84%
collect all the honey,
bring it back to our house.

00:01:51.935 --> 00:01:54.650 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.520 align:middle line:84%
We'd have gardens,
biodynamic gardens.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.120 align:middle line:84%
We'd have integrated
pest management.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.840 align:middle line:84%
So if there were
any aphids, we'd

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.146 align:middle line:84%
bring in ladybugs who would
get rid of the aphids.

00:02:07.146 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And just-- where there was
concrete, we had strawberries.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.140 align:middle line:84%
It was the first time
that we had put together

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.390 align:middle line:84%
all the talent of creating
a house that was completely

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.410 align:middle line:84%
self-reliant, powered
by the sun and the wind,

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.700 align:middle line:84%
with fish growing in the
backyard and chickens

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.370 align:middle line:84%
in the chicken
coops, and rabbits.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And so, it created
a collaboration

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.480 align:middle line:84%
that has been going
on for around 25 years

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.220 align:middle line:84%
now to build self-sustaining
life support systems.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And there's a tremendous
amount of good news

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.420 align:middle line:90%
coming from that work.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>>So here we are, almost
30 years down the road

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.020 align:middle line:84%
from that time, and
now your backyard

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.990 align:middle line:84%
has stretched overseas to doing
very large joint endeavors

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.780 align:middle line:90%
with the Chinese even.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.400 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hm.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>And so between those
two points in history,

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.555 align:middle line:84%
tell me about the evolution
of some of these technologies

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:11.220 align:middle line:84%
that you were working
with back in 1976,

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.092 align:middle line:84%
and where they are
today, and how close

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:14.300 align:middle line:90%
they are to being rolled out.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.784 align:middle line:84%
It would seem that 30
years is a long time.

00:03:18.784 --> 00:03:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Logically, it seems
that we should

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.430 align:middle line:84%
be seeing some of
this in use right now.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.370 align:middle line:90%
But we're not.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.866 align:middle line:90%
>>It's definitely emerged.

00:03:27.866 --> 00:03:31.950 align:middle line:84%
If I can describe a few
of the components of it.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, photovoltaics,
which was about $1,000 a watt

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.020 align:middle line:90%
in 1976.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>This is solar power
you're talking about?

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>Electricity from
direct sunlight

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.080 align:middle line:90%
was used for satellites.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.380 align:middle line:84%
It was very expensive
at that time.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, we've
had major breakthroughs

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.570 align:middle line:84%
to where now the
cost of photovoltaics

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.840 align:middle line:90%
is down at around $3 a watt.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.250 align:middle line:90%
From $1,000 a watt to $3 a watt.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.254 align:middle line:84%
>>Then why aren't we
seeing more of it?

00:04:01.254 --> 00:04:03.837 align:middle line:84%
Or is that a separate question
we should get into a little bit

00:04:03.837 --> 00:04:04.450 align:middle line:90%
later?

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>We are definitely
seeing more of it,

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.985 align:middle line:90%
and I will provide you examples.

00:04:07.985 --> 00:04:11.000 align:middle line:90%


00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.090 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the states have
provided incentive programs

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.540 align:middle line:84%
to buy down the cost
of photovoltaics.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.490 align:middle line:84%
California, Nevada,
Texas, New York,

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.190 align:middle line:84%
if you buy a photovoltaic
power system,

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.190 align:middle line:84%
you will be rebated by
the state for the cost

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.270 align:middle line:90%
of the photovoltaics.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.770 align:middle line:84%
So the photovoltaics
are, in effect,

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.570 align:middle line:90%
paid for by the rate payers.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So photovoltaics has come
a tremendously long way.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Right now, all of our
photovoltaics have been

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.920 align:middle line:84%
purchased by Germany
because in Germany,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.890 align:middle line:84%
if you produce
power from the sun,

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.200 align:middle line:84%
you are paid $0.50
a kilowatt hour.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>>Amazing.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>>So a great incentive
that Germany has in place.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And so, photovoltaics is
going through miraculous turns

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:84%
right now as we have finally
gone to war over oil.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.610 align:middle line:84%
So now the clock
is really ticking.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Wind energy, a very
ancient source of power.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.920 align:middle line:84%
There are-- I mean,
I could tell you

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.040 align:middle line:84%
stories about how,
for example, Holland,

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:84%
which was a terribly
barren place in Europe

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.410 align:middle line:84%
with just the winds
of the North Sea

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.060 align:middle line:90%
blowing down on this country.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.490 align:middle line:84%
This little country developed
the first wind machines

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.780 align:middle line:90%
in Europe.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And with it, began to have
the first windmills, which

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.660 align:middle line:90%
in effect were used.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.380 align:middle line:84%
The giant band saws that
were cutting up the lumber.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Logs that were flowing down from
the Rhine River, from the Alps,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.460 align:middle line:84%
were cut up into
more wind machines.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.080 align:middle line:84%
So the would machines were
reproducing themselves.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And also the making
of ships, which

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.640 align:middle line:84%
were the Dutch, the East
India Company, all those ships

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.990 align:middle line:90%
were made from wind machines.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, the Dutch millwrights
went to the bankers and said,

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.170 align:middle line:90%
we have an incredible idea.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.474 align:middle line:90%
And they said, what is it?

00:06:12.474 --> 00:06:13.890 align:middle line:84%
They said, we know
how to increase

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.930 align:middle line:84%
the size of the
country because we're

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.180 align:middle line:84%
going to pump out all the
lakes and all the-- we're

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.160 align:middle line:84%
going to pump out the
ocean of our country,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.480 align:middle line:84%
and increase the
size of our country.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So they received
immediate financing

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.340 align:middle line:84%
from these very
successful groups,

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.560 align:middle line:90%
and the bankers in Holland.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And then the final
experiment was

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.370 align:middle line:84%
to put these prefabricated
wind machines made

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.710 align:middle line:84%
from wind machines on ships
made from wind machines.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.470 align:middle line:84%
They then went to
the New World, set up

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.600 align:middle line:84%
the wind machines
in Long Island,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.430 align:middle line:84%
and built New Amsterdam, which
is today's New York City.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>>New York City.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>So it's a very
ancient technology.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Now where it's come to
about the turn of the 19th

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.290 align:middle line:84%
through the 20th
century, about 1900,

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.800 align:middle line:84%
the first wind
machines out of Denmark

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.630 align:middle line:90%
were producing electricity.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And so over the
years, especially

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.330 align:middle line:84%
with the-- what happened
was, the oil shocks

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.440 align:middle line:84%
of the early '70s began
to create a great interest

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.000 align:middle line:84%
in producing electricity
from the wind.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So in California, we were
the first modern wind machine

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.150 align:middle line:84%
company called
Aero Power Systems

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.706 align:middle line:90%
about the same time, 1978.

00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And then all of
a sudden, we were

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.290 align:middle line:84%
inundated by limited
partnerships wanting

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.680 align:middle line:84%
to build wind farms
in Altamont Pass.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And so we were the
first at Altamont

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.420 align:middle line:84%
Pass to do the site surveys
and to plan the first machines.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Where we are at now is wind
machines, wind turbines,

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.260 align:middle line:84%
are the most cost effective
of all renewable energy

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.720 align:middle line:90%
machines and sources.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.810 align:middle line:84%
So we are now seeing tremendous
activity out of Germany,

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.850 align:middle line:84%
which is the leader
right now, followed

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:20.902 align:middle line:84%
by Spain, which is number
two, India, Greece.

00:08:20.902 --> 00:08:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Different parts of the world
where there is tremendous wind

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.380 align:middle line:84%
resources are now
tapping into the wind.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.610 align:middle line:84%
So wind is the most
ready out of all of them.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>Also, were they
not more motivated

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.220 align:middle line:84%
because of the cost of
petroleum in those areas?

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, yes.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:40.830 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you're paying
$4.50 a gallon it becomes very

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.685 align:middle line:84%
interesting to begin
to use renewables.

00:08:43.685 --> 00:08:44.960 align:middle line:90%
You bet.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.820 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, wind energy in its
history in the United States,

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.330 align:middle line:84%
this isn't new to
the United States.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.440 align:middle line:84%
When you look across
the Great Plains,

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.710 align:middle line:84%
wind technology was
used in the earlier

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.860 align:middle line:84%
part of the 20th
century certainly,

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:05.550 align:middle line:84%
but what happened and
basically eliminated wind power

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.640 align:middle line:84%
from the plains and other
areas in the United States?

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, it started
out that they say

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:17.810 align:middle line:84%
that the West was settled by
three and four ingredients.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Certainly barbed wire, Colt
.45s, wind pumpers, and women,

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.290 align:middle line:84%
I would say, helped
settle the west.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And there was some 12
million water pumpers

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:35.820 align:middle line:90%
in use since the 1860s.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And then right
around the 1920s, we

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.160 align:middle line:84%
began to see the likes
of the Jacobs brothers,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Marcellus Jacobs, were carving
high-speed propeller impeller

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.270 align:middle line:90%
blades in South Dakota.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And then companies
like Winco came along,

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.270 align:middle line:84%
small wind machine
companies that

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.890 align:middle line:84%
began to produce
electricity on the prairies

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.860 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.930 align:middle line:84%
It was so prolific that
when Philco Radio came along

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.400 align:middle line:84%
and the first radio stations
came out of St. Louis,

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.290 align:middle line:84%
because there was no
power for the customers,

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Philco Radio and RCA would just
give people a wind generator

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.550 align:middle line:84%
to go with their radio so they
could listen to their radio.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:21.480 align:middle line:90%
[REGINA LAUGHS]

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.940 align:middle line:84%
So here was wireless
technology--

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.936 align:middle line:84%
>>Certainly a creative
partnership, yes.

00:10:24.936 --> 00:10:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>You know, wireless
radio transmission

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.870 align:middle line:84%
was, in effect, bringing
the first information

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.310 align:middle line:84%
from St. Louis out
into the Missouri

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:90%
hills and the prairies.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.050 align:middle line:84%
The first radio out of
Chicago and St. Louis

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.920 align:middle line:84%
was then broadcast and
received by those early farmers

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.320 align:middle line:84%
out there in the
whole revolution

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.460 align:middle line:84%
of radio, which is
another major story.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.970 align:middle line:90%


00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Then with the advent of
the Rural Electrification

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Administration
through FDR, 1930s,

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.530 align:middle line:84%
there was an effort to go out
to those rural communities

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:01.520 align:middle line:84%
and to begin to bring
in the power grid.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.650 align:middle line:84%
So the plan basically was,
by the Rural Development

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Administration, to bring
electricity and power

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:11.390 align:middle line:90%
to those remote and rural areas.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And so their pitch
was, you will now

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.892 align:middle line:84%
be able to participate
in civilization.

00:11:15.892 --> 00:11:17.600 align:middle line:84%
We're going to light
up the main streets,

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.266 align:middle line:84%
we're going the light
up all the country

00:11:19.266 --> 00:11:20.750 align:middle line:90%
lanes that are in the darkness.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And all we ask is that
you have five appliances.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you have
five appliances, we

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.814 align:middle line:90%
will give you a free hook up.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.230 align:middle line:84%
You'll have to pay
for the energy,

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.520 align:middle line:90%
but the hook up is free.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of farmers
who, at that time,

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:41.517 align:middle line:84%
had small wind generators on
their farms got a hook up.

00:11:41.517 --> 00:11:42.850 align:middle line:90%
They thought, oh, this is great.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:45.930 align:middle line:84%
We'll get a washing machine,
the wife will like that.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:50.800 align:middle line:84%
I'll have some electricity for
threshing machines, toasters,

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.273 align:middle line:84%
and the radio, of
course, which was

00:11:53.273 --> 00:11:56.740 align:middle line:84%
sort of the main cultural
piece in the house,

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.160 align:middle line:90%
and they began to get hooked up.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And so the irony of the
story is in many cases,

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:04.150 align:middle line:84%
and we've interviewed
these farmers,

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.070 align:middle line:84%
they would say that after
they were hooked up,

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.344 align:middle line:84%
the REA would come
back and say, listen,

00:12:09.344 --> 00:12:11.510 align:middle line:84%
now that you're hooked up
to civilization you really

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:14.220 align:middle line:84%
won't need that wind
generator anymore.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you knock
it off it's towers?

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you-- or take it down.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.694 align:middle line:84%
And then they would say, well,
we kind of like it, you know.

00:12:23.694 --> 00:12:25.860 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, you're not
going to need it anymore.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.460 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of machines, I
would say tens of thousands

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.970 align:middle line:84%
of machines, were
taken off their tower

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.400 align:middle line:84%
or knocked off
the tower and laid

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.430 align:middle line:84%
in those fields
for some 30 years

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.370 align:middle line:84%
until the '70s, when
we went back out there

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.300 align:middle line:84%
and bought the Jacobs
generators, which

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.000 align:middle line:84%
were like the Cadillac of
wind machines at that time.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And then in the late '70s,
we began to refurbish those.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And our group actually,
we had the privilege

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.720 align:middle line:84%
of working with the
Jacobs brothers, who

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:01.300 align:middle line:84%
taught us everything they
knew as we began to make wind

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.450 align:middle line:84%
powered alternators, A/C
generating alternators.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of what we learned
came from the Jacobs brothers.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>>So you made a business of
recovering these old machines

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.490 align:middle line:84%
and then, like you say,
refurbishing them and then

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.370 align:middle line:84%
putting them back up in--
where were they utilized?

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Were they used primarily
in-- did you bring them back

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.200 align:middle line:84%
to California or where
were they utilized?

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>>We had a factory in
Berkeley, Aero Power Systems,

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:33.430 align:middle line:84%
and we did renovate
the machines.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.340 align:middle line:84%
We also immediately went on
to some of the breakthroughs

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.300 align:middle line:90%
that have happened.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.370 align:middle line:84%
These were generators
so they had brushes,

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.580 align:middle line:84%
which had to be re-machined,
and so we went on

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:47.340 align:middle line:84%
to creating new aluminum
castings for alternators, which

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.770 align:middle line:84%
are A/C producing
alternating current

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.130 align:middle line:90%
that have electronic circuits.

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:56.030 align:middle line:84%
So we were the first to
use modern voltage control

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:58.400 align:middle line:90%
circuits on these generators.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And also had an extensive blade
company and blade manufacturer,

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:08.560 align:middle line:84%
so we redo the governors
and the blade assemblies

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.870 align:middle line:84%
for harnessing the
energy in the wind.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>Before we go on to
what's happened since then,

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.430 align:middle line:84%
because the new
technology in wind power

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:23.510 align:middle line:84%
looks considerably different
from the old windmills,

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.480 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about
some other modalities

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll come back to
the advances in the technology.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:29.464 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
photovoltaics,

00:14:29.464 --> 00:14:33.090 align:middle line:84%
we've talked about wind,
what about tidal power

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.270 align:middle line:90%
from the ocean's waves?

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.010 align:middle line:90%
>>Sure.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:41.240 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that water is
800 times as dense as air.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.500 align:middle line:84%
So in a machine, a wind
machine-- if you placed a wind

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.830 align:middle line:84%
machine in a river,
for example, you

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:50.090 align:middle line:84%
would get effectively
25 times the output as

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:51.710 align:middle line:90%
if it was in the wind.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:54.340 align:middle line:90%
That's an effective output.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:58.990 align:middle line:84%
So a little 500 watt
wind machine in the water

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:03.370 align:middle line:90%
would produce 12,500 watts.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.170 align:middle line:90%
And we've documented that.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:10.420 align:middle line:84%
So certainly, current turbines
are extremely attractive.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.680 align:middle line:84%
There are a variety of formats
being tested and tried right

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:19.610 align:middle line:84%
now, a lot of them in England--
radioactivity in England.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's some
talk in the Bay Area

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:26.330 align:middle line:84%
of harnessing the tidal flows
that flow underneath the Golden

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.760 align:middle line:90%
Gate Bridge, and its massive.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:35.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the energy in the water
could power all of our energy

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.990 align:middle line:90%
needs several times over.

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>Has this technology
been developed

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.770 align:middle line:90%
to the point of usefulness?

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:45.270 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:46.156 align:middle line:90%
>>Is it already there?

00:15:46.156 --> 00:15:46.781 align:middle line:90%
Is it patented?

00:15:46.781 --> 00:15:47.890 align:middle line:90%
Is it ready to go?

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>There are patents.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.720 align:middle line:84%
There have been demonstration
projects over the years,

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.420 align:middle line:90%
both in the Hudson River.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:59.490 align:middle line:84%
There been some attempts
to harness the Gulf Stream.

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:02.560 align:middle line:90%
Several river experiments.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.380 align:middle line:84%
My first information on
this came from a project

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.480 align:middle line:84%
to harness the Nile,
to basically pump

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.600 align:middle line:90%
water over the Nile.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:14.140 align:middle line:84%
To use an underwater wind
machine, water machine,

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:18.860 align:middle line:84%
to lift water over the
dyke into the Sudan.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.390 align:middle line:84%
So those-- it's
been accomplished.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And what it's coming
down to now is

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle line:84%
what is the right
economy of scale,

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and should we harness
water directly?

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:35.305 align:middle line:84%
Because it is a
tremendous thrust force.

00:16:35.305 --> 00:16:39.780 align:middle line:84%
The weight of the water, the
mass of that flowing water

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.340 align:middle line:84%
can overturn any
kind of structure.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:48.420 align:middle line:84%
So we've been looking at using
compressed air, for example.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Creating underwater
venturis and creating-- I

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.700 align:middle line:84%
mean the air be drawn
into some air turbines

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.439 align:middle line:84%
as an easier way
of dealing with it.

00:16:57.439 --> 00:16:59.480 align:middle line:84%
The machine that I've been
working with basically

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.410 align:middle line:84%
uses hydraulics, so we have
no electricity under water,

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.839 align:middle line:90%
everything is above water.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:06.650 align:middle line:84%
But we're creating
hydraulic pressure,

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.930 align:middle line:84%
which then runs hydraulic
motors and hydraulic generation

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.710 align:middle line:90%
of electricity.

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.394 align:middle line:84%
>>So now let's go
on to another issue,

00:17:16.394 --> 00:17:17.810 align:middle line:84%
because we're
just-- we're looking

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:19.110 align:middle line:90%
at the needs of the future.

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:22.700 align:middle line:84%
We're going to need
clean renewable energy.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:27.640 align:middle line:84%
We have major issues with the
environment and the greenhouse

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:32.260 align:middle line:84%
effect, et cetera, so we need
a clean source of energy.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:36.610 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at wind, we're
looking at hydraulic power.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:37.470 align:middle line:90%
What do you call it?

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:38.330 align:middle line:90%
Tidal power?

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.220 align:middle line:84%
What is the term for this
whole genre of technology?

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:41.830 align:middle line:90%
Tidal power?

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.570 align:middle line:84%
It's tidal power
or current turbines

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:50.130 align:middle line:84%
or hydropower, which is
where you would lift water

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.830 align:middle line:84%
or accumulate
water behind a dam.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:57.112 align:middle line:84%
And there are now better
solutions than building dams,

00:17:57.112 --> 00:17:58.570 align:middle line:84%
because the result
of building dams

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:03.840 align:middle line:84%
is you lay waste to a tremendous
amount of land behind the dam.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:09.160 align:middle line:84%
We now can do ambient
turbines that are in rivers

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.330 align:middle line:84%
and extract the water
out of the river,

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.750 align:middle line:84%
run it through a turbine,
put it back into the river.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.850 align:middle line:84%
We're just removing
the energy of that.

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And hydropower is, in
effect, gravity energy.

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:23.850 align:middle line:90%
It's based on the gravity.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>>So we're looking at power
sources through the sun,

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.740 align:middle line:90%
through the wind, through water.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Another issue is becoming
fresh water supplies,

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.900 align:middle line:90%
clean and fresh water supplies.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.870 align:middle line:90%
Globally this is an issue.

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:42.310 align:middle line:84%
What about progress in the area,
for example, of desalinization?

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hm.

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:45.430 align:middle line:90%
Certainly.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:48.600 align:middle line:84%
I would also mention
one more energy source

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.750 align:middle line:84%
that is equally
interesting and important,

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:56.500 align:middle line:84%
and that is the internal
combustion engine.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:02.190 align:middle line:84%
We now have fuels that
are incredibly clean.

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:03.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it involves
combustion, which

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:05.570 align:middle line:84%
is what we're trying
to get away from,

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:08.560 align:middle line:84%
but we now have
biodiesel, for example.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.821 align:middle line:84%
>>Can you talk about
biodiesel for a moment?

00:19:10.821 --> 00:19:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>>Certainly.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Biodiesel allows
us to make diesel

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:20.610 align:middle line:84%
from biomass, which can grow on
the millions of acres of land

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:22.401 align:middle line:90%
that are just being unutilized.

00:19:22.401 --> 00:19:24.150 align:middle line:84%
When you drive through
the west some time,

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:28.480 align:middle line:84%
you just drive-through millions
of acres of unused land.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:84%
We could easily plant canola,
or what's called rapeseeds.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.000 align:middle line:90%
These are like mustard seed.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.250 align:middle line:84%
They're yellow flowers,
very attractive.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:49.250 align:middle line:84%
We could extract some 2,000 to
3,000 kilograms per acre of oil

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:52.220 align:middle line:84%
from these plants, and we could
feed the rest to the animals.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:56.520 align:middle line:84%
The animals would still
eat the residue of that.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Canola oil, and make
it into biodiesel.

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:04.010 align:middle line:84%
We also breakthrough
technologies now using plasma

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:07.440 align:middle line:84%
plugs, plasma spark
plugs, where we are now

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.880 align:middle line:84%
running micro turbines or
rotary engine turbines, which

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:15.700 align:middle line:84%
only have one moving
part and have no valves,

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:23.370 align:middle line:84%
where we can run the engine
on 60% water and 40% alcohol.

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're actually making the
hydrogen inside the engine,

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:31.080 align:middle line:90%
and then combusting it.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>You said this is
a micro generator?

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:34.975 align:middle line:90%
>>Micro generator.

00:20:34.975 --> 00:20:35.850 align:middle line:90%
Very, very important.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:39.505 align:middle line:84%
>>Give us an example of the
scale of this micro generation

00:20:39.505 --> 00:20:45.430 align:middle line:84%
unit, and what its output
is in practical terms.

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>>Sure.

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:50.440 align:middle line:90%
It's basically a rotary engine.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.490 align:middle line:84%
It has no pistons and
has a continuing rotating

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:56.250 align:middle line:90%
Lundell in the center.

00:20:56.250 --> 00:21:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And the engine is
about 50 horsepower.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And attached to it
with a direct drive,

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.360 align:middle line:84%
one shaft, one
piece of rotation,

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:14.550 align:middle line:84%
is a 35-kilowatt generator using
neodymium magnets from China.

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So these are very high-density
magnetic generators.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:23.630 align:middle line:84%
The entire package is
about two cubic feet.

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've ever
seen a 35-kilowatt generator,

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:28.490 align:middle line:90%
but it's as big as a room.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:30.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's all been
miniaturized down

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.250 align:middle line:84%
into this really
tight little package,

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.110 align:middle line:84%
and these are basically
the auxiliary power units

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:36.889 align:middle line:84%
for the future
hybrid electric cars,

00:21:36.889 --> 00:21:38.680 align:middle line:84%
once we go industrial
with hybrid electric.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.690 align:middle line:90%


00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:43.879 align:middle line:84%
>>What's their
application right now?

00:21:43.879 --> 00:21:45.420 align:middle line:84%
What would they
power-- what are they

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:49.980 align:middle line:84%
capable of powering in the
sense of our domestic lives?

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, 35 kilowatts,
you know, a typical house

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:58.310 align:middle line:84%
uses about 20 kilowatt
hours per day.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:00.540 align:middle line:84%
So with this
running, let's say it

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:05.980 align:middle line:84%
runs for eight
hours, that would be

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:10.870 align:middle line:84%
around-- it could
power 10 houses.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And the fuel would be renewable
in that we can grow the fuel.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.050 align:middle line:84%
This is not fossil
fuel we're burning.

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:20.490 align:middle line:84%
This is either alcohol we have
made from biomass or biodiesel

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.070 align:middle line:90%
that we have grown.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>>So, in essence, what would
the cost be per kilowatt hour

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:29.135 align:middle line:84%
compared to what we're
paying right now?

00:22:29.135 --> 00:22:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to
get a real, down home

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:35.430 align:middle line:84%
look at what this means in
this tiny little two cubic foot

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.370 align:middle line:90%
device.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>>The cost would be
certainly probably

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.760 align:middle line:90%
on the level of a wind machine.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.110 align:middle line:84%
A wind machine, the
capital cost right now

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.130 align:middle line:90%
is $1 a watt for large turbines.

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:55.580 align:middle line:84%
It's more like $2 a watt
for smaller scale machines.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:23:01.770 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you wanted a
10,000 watt wind machine.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.230 align:middle line:90%
That would cost around $20,000.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:06.445 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hm.

00:23:06.445 --> 00:23:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>>A 35-kilowatt device as
I'm talking about this micro

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:21.140 align:middle line:84%
turbine, would be probably
on the level of $0.50 a watt.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:84%
The beauty of the
renewables, of course,

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:28.880 align:middle line:84%
is that the device costs money,
but there's no fuel cost.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.210 align:middle line:84%
With the micro turbine,
there's some fuel costs.

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:34.530 align:middle line:84%
But certainly affordable,
very affordable.

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:39.030 align:middle line:84%
We just need to
manufacture these now.

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>And that technology
already exists?

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.210 align:middle line:84%
The patents are there and
this is tried and true?

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.206 align:middle line:84%
>>This has huge applications
then for rural areas

00:23:48.206 --> 00:23:50.390 align:middle line:84%
in particular, it
would sound like.

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:55.630 align:middle line:84%
One of the-- I'll get
back to your question

00:23:55.630 --> 00:24:00.330 align:middle line:84%
about the other
sources of power,

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:04.030 align:middle line:84%
but what's basically happened
is the paradigm shift

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:07.325 align:middle line:90%
is this, as far as renewables.

00:24:07.325 --> 00:24:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's comparable
to the internet.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:14.250 align:middle line:84%
The internet is a very unique
communications technology

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:19.220 align:middle line:84%
in that it's now possible to
have two-way communication.

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.690 align:middle line:84%
The previous form
of communication

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.290 align:middle line:84%
was de facto
communication where you'd

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:25.500 align:middle line:84%
have a transmitter
that would send out

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.010 align:middle line:84%
the information via
television or whatever,

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:30.300 align:middle line:84%
and then everybody
would be a receiver.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.590 align:middle line:90%
There was no way to talk back.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And so in the internet,
you have what's

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.540 align:middle line:84%
called an asynchronous
adapter, which

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:43.210 align:middle line:84%
allows for two-way
communication protocol.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the energy
field, we have

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:47.540 align:middle line:90%
the same type of technology.

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.850 align:middle line:84%
The previous paradigm
was that energy

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:52.850 align:middle line:84%
was produced in a
centralized power plant

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:57.050 align:middle line:84%
and then sent out to the
customers through the grid.

00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Now it's possible for the
extremities of the grid,

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.330 align:middle line:84%
for each house, to
power the center.

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>>To feedback.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>>To feedback.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.416 align:middle line:84%
To send energy back to
the main power plant.

00:25:07.416 --> 00:25:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>>It certainly makes sense.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>Using synchronous inverters.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's just exactly like
the internet, you know?

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:19.430 align:middle line:84%
So the future of
energy is not going

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:25.630 align:middle line:84%
to be more nuclear power
plants, more centralized gas

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:29.150 align:middle line:84%
and oil-fired power
plants, but millions

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:34.560 align:middle line:84%
of micro generators
in homes and offices

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.630 align:middle line:84%
co-producing energy
with the grid

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and feeding it back,
and getting paid for it.

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>>And it sounds as though
certainly the benefits of this

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:48.350 align:middle line:90%
would be virtually no pollution.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>>Certainly.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.630 align:middle line:84%
The other aspect of this whole--
the business of the whole thing

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:58.660 align:middle line:84%
is when we do a wind
farm, we basically

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:01.425 align:middle line:84%
are selling our energy through
a power purchase agreement.

00:26:01.425 --> 00:26:04.450 align:middle line:90%


00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:08.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, in China we're selling
it for $0.07 a kilowatt hour.

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:10.760 align:middle line:84%
In the Philippines
it's $0.11 a kilowatt.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:16.040 align:middle line:84%
In California it's
$0.049 cents a kilowatt.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:20.820 align:middle line:84%
This is the value of
our energy as we sell it

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:24.080 align:middle line:84%
on the wholesale level
back to the power grid.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:28.820 align:middle line:84%
We also will get paid
through greenhouse credits,

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:33.490 align:middle line:84%
through green tags, about
$0.018 cents per kilowatt hour.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:38.520 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we're going to
get rewarded for sequestering

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.290 align:middle line:84%
carbon dioxide,
nitrogen dioxide,

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:47.860 align:middle line:84%
so that we are receiving
credits for pollution

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:51.450 align:middle line:84%
that we are not producing
through these technologies.

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
important part

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.830 align:middle line:90%
to the story, the green tags.

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>>Very important
part to the story.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Just maybe quickly
touch on the notion

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:03.250 align:middle line:84%
of clean water and
desalinization--

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:05.958 align:middle line:84%
>>-technology at this point
in time before we go back

00:27:05.958 --> 00:27:07.134 align:middle line:90%
to the larger issue.

00:27:07.134 --> 00:27:07.675 align:middle line:90%
>>Definitely.

00:27:07.675 --> 00:27:10.920 align:middle line:90%


00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.700 align:middle line:84%
As we look at the planet,
we have a surprising amount

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:20.670 align:middle line:84%
of very little fresh
water resources.

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And this has been aggravated
by the fact and the invention

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:24.380 align:middle line:90%
of the flush toilet.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.310 align:middle line:84%
So basically, every time
somebody goes to the bathroom,

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:32.400 align:middle line:84%
we are flushing some five
gallons of our drinking water

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.901 align:middle line:90%
to the sewage plant.

00:27:33.901 --> 00:27:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And then we go
through great expense

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.940 align:middle line:84%
to clean up what is a
mistake in the first place.

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:43.620 align:middle line:84%
We're coming out of an
era where our gasoline has

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.120 align:middle line:84%
been cheaper than drinking
water, quite a bit cheaper

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.920 align:middle line:90%
than drinking water.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And so now we're
at the point where

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:54.600 align:middle line:84%
water may become more precious
than our fossil fuels.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:59.120 align:middle line:84%
We already have drawn down
the aquifers in the Midwest.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:05.120 align:middle line:84%
We need to seriously look
at desalinating seawater.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.380 align:middle line:84%
We have municipalities
like Littleton, Colorado,

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:13.770 align:middle line:84%
drinking their sewage water,
which has been cleaned.

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:15.630 align:middle line:90%
Again, a mistake.

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:20.440 align:middle line:84%
That's a very costly mistake
to use our drinking supplies.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And some of the technologies
for desalinating seawater

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:27.880 align:middle line:84%
have involved osmotic membranes,
and very energy intensive.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.740 align:middle line:84%
It takes a lot of energy
to do it this way.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And so now, there are all
kinds of new technologies

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:36.930 align:middle line:90%
like, for example, ultrasonics.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:40.280 align:middle line:84%
The ultrasonic
desalinization of water,

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:44.240 align:middle line:84%
where the salt
crystals are actually

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.510 align:middle line:84%
removed ultrasonically,
they precipitate out.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:49.700 align:middle line:90%


00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:53.066 align:middle line:84%
There's now talk about
structured water,

00:28:53.066 --> 00:28:57.500 align:middle line:84%
as a way to really enhance
the quality of water.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Water is-- we know very
little about water,

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:04.290 align:middle line:84%
even though about
95% of us is water.

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.790 align:middle line:84%
So these are all
the applications.

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:11.100 align:middle line:84%
I have been focusing on the
development of renewable energy

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:15.810 align:middle line:84%
technologies and what really
drives it now, and always has,

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:17.540 align:middle line:90%
is the application.

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Once we produce energy
in a remote area, wow,

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:22.620 align:middle line:90%
we can desalinate seawater.

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:28.210 align:middle line:84%
We can pump water, we
can do all those tasks

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:30.580 align:middle line:84%
that have to be done
that require electricity.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Electricity is the
preferred form of power.

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:34.420 align:middle line:90%
It has no entropy.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.170 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't degrade.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:39.070 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't run out of a wire.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:43.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the preferred form
of power on the planet.

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>>So what's stopping us then?

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.930 align:middle line:84%
All these technologies
you've talked about,

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.040 align:middle line:84%
save for perhaps
some of the last bits

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.968 align:middle line:84%
on the desalinization,
are already present,

00:29:53.968 --> 00:29:55.092 align:middle line:90%
they're already functional.

00:29:55.092 --> 00:29:57.560 align:middle line:84%
The patents,
[INAUDIBLE] are there.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hm.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>Why are we not
seeing more of this?

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people watching
this have probably never heard

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:08.304 align:middle line:84%
of most of it, and certainly
have never seen it in use.

00:30:08.304 --> 00:30:09.080 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, it's the nature of how
our financial entrepreneurial

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:15.000 align:middle line:90%
system works, you know.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, fact one, most of
the innovations on the planet

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.840 align:middle line:84%
are coming from
groups of people,

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.520 align:middle line:84%
anywhere from two
to seven people.

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.710 align:middle line:84%
More innovations are
coming from the companies

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:27.306 align:middle line:84%
of that scale than
large corporations.

00:30:27.306 --> 00:30:30.340 align:middle line:90%


00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a tremendous
amount of effort

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.860 align:middle line:84%
to wait till a company is
established and has a product,

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.830 align:middle line:84%
and then it's bought
by a larger company.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:40.527 align:middle line:90%
That's constant.

00:30:40.527 --> 00:30:41.610 align:middle line:90%
That happens all the time.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:42.939 align:middle line:90%
>>What do they do, shelve it?

00:30:42.939 --> 00:30:45.550 align:middle line:90%
Why aren't we seeing it?

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>It's basically--
it's a market problem.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:52.430 align:middle line:84%
You have to demonstrate
that you have a market.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:55.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, first of all, let me
give you a perspective on what

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.580 align:middle line:84%
it takes to develop
a new idea, OK?

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:59.750 align:middle line:90%
There are millions of new ideas.

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:05.990 align:middle line:84%
But the difference
between having an idea

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:08.770 align:middle line:84%
and actually getting it
realized in the world,

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:13.410 align:middle line:84%
there is a huge gulf,
a no-man's land really,

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:19.240 align:middle line:84%
between having an idea and then
going to your wife or family

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.590 align:middle line:84%
and saying, look, I need
to develop this idea.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:23.480 align:middle line:84%
This is going to
change the world.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to make lots of money.

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:28.040 align:middle line:84%
So I want to borrow money
from the family to do this.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.160 align:middle line:90%
I need to create a prototype.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:35.489 align:middle line:84%
And then even once the prototype
is created, how are you

00:31:35.489 --> 00:31:36.530 align:middle line:90%
going to get it marketed?

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:38.550 align:middle line:84%
How are you going
to raise money?

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Most inventors at that
point don't have it.

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>They're tapped out.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>They're tapped out, and they
don't have the business skills.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.200 align:middle line:90%
They're innovators.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And so what's needed
is a group of people

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:55.990 align:middle line:84%
that can kind of incubate that
idea, and at the same time

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:59.850 align:middle line:84%
that an idea is being developed,
do some market research,

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:02.289 align:middle line:84%
see is there even a
need for this device,

00:32:02.289 --> 00:32:03.830 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
people invent things

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:05.240 align:middle line:90%
where there's no market for it.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:08.720 align:middle line:84%
It's just nifty,
it's a nifty thing.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.170 align:middle line:84%
So our group is
basically market driven.

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:14.370 align:middle line:84%
We have one foot
in the marketplace

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:19.640 align:middle line:84%
and so we know that if we
develop a water desalination

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:23.610 align:middle line:84%
device for remote
areas of the world,

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:25.150 align:middle line:90%
we have a massive market.

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:27.870 align:middle line:90%
We can demonstrate that.

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:29.430 align:middle line:90%
So that's the problem.

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:38.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just we have been very
comfortable in our lifestyles.

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:42.625 align:middle line:84%
Our energy supplies
have been based

00:32:42.625 --> 00:32:47.740 align:middle line:84%
on liquid fuel, a
fossil fuel that

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:51.680 align:middle line:84%
is found in some very remote
and politically unstable

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.320 align:middle line:90%
areas of the world.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:58.860 align:middle line:90%
We are coming to the peak oil.

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:02.184 align:middle line:84%
Some say it's already
happened, this is the peak.

00:33:02.184 --> 00:33:04.350 align:middle line:84%
From here on in, it's going
to get much, much harder

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:07.810 align:middle line:90%
to find more fossil fuels.

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:09.820 align:middle line:84%
These fossil fuels
are, in many cases,

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:13.990 align:middle line:84%
in remote areas where very
unstable political situations,

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:18.190 align:middle line:84%
thus our involvement in
the Mideast right now.

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:22.270 align:middle line:84%
When at the same time, we have
the sun shining on our roofs

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:22.910 align:middle line:90%
in the US.

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:25.110 align:middle line:84%
We have the wind
blowing over our heads.

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:28.770 align:middle line:84%
We have energy everywhere
available on the planet,

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:29.390 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:33.570 align:middle line:84%
So our focus has just
been on centralized power

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:35.510 align:middle line:90%
and the liquid-fueled economy.

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And what's ahead of
us now is to produce

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:47.380 align:middle line:84%
sustainable green technologies
that can be locally produced,

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.980 align:middle line:90%
that tap into local power.

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
in front of us.

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>So up until now,
in essence, we

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:58.920 align:middle line:84%
have not been motivated
to change the status quo.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.770 align:middle line:84%
How far away do you feel we
are from the average person

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:05.260 align:middle line:84%
feeling motivated, I
mean, we're in a war,

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:07.660 align:middle line:84%
we're sending your
kids over there.

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:10.949 align:middle line:84%
Our gas prices are
rising by the moment.

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:12.760 align:middle line:84%
How long before we're
comfortable enough

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:16.860 align:middle line:84%
to, as consumers,
demand changes?

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.590 align:middle line:90%


00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:24.719 align:middle line:84%
>>I think the innovations--
well, first of all,

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:27.364 align:middle line:84%
we have city people
who are used to

00:34:27.364 --> 00:34:29.420 align:middle line:90%
an established infrastructure.

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:33.850 align:middle line:84%
The roads, the electricity,
the gas lines, everything.

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:37.962 align:middle line:84%
The food on the
shelves in the store.

00:34:37.962 --> 00:34:41.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, a vast distribution
system that works.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:44.139 align:middle line:84%
And let's hope none of
it ever breaks down.

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:48.520 align:middle line:84%
If it breaks down,
the city people

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.909 align:middle line:90%
are the first group in danger.

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:54.179 align:middle line:90%
It'll be a bad discontinuity.

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:56.000 align:middle line:84%
People in remote
areas of the world

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.560 align:middle line:84%
already are aware of where
their energy comes from.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.840 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
a wood pile, you're

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.360 align:middle line:84%
going to freeze
through the winter.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:08.200 align:middle line:84%
So the remote power
market is really

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.640 align:middle line:90%
what's driving this whole thing.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.260 align:middle line:90%


00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.260 align:middle line:84%
The people in the city
are just beginning

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:19.400 align:middle line:84%
to look at co-generating
with the grid now.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.690 align:middle line:84%
There's been some talk about
doing community gardens, which

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:25.630 align:middle line:90%
has been somewhat successful.

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:26.860 align:middle line:90%
>>And successful in Europe.

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And it has been traditionally
successful in other countries,

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.140 align:middle line:90%
but we're just awakening to it.

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:40.460 align:middle line:84%
We are all copying this
high-energy lifestyle,

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:43.720 align:middle line:84%
and it's getting
us into trouble.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.490 align:middle line:84%
There was a time in
Europe in the 1880s when

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:49.470 align:middle line:84%
the city of Paris
grew more food using

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:52.630 align:middle line:84%
the French intensive method
on the rooftops of the city

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:55.700 align:middle line:84%
that the city of Paris was
actually exporting food

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.900 align:middle line:90%
to the countryside.

00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely amazing.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.832 align:middle line:84%
And all of that
is still possible.

00:36:00.832 --> 00:36:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>>Still possible.

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>>It's an incredible
method of agriculture.

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>>You know, you have to
stand in a very high place,

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.140 align:middle line:84%
like in a high building,
and look down over the city

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:16.340 align:middle line:84%
and see that the last
frontier is the rooftop.

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:19.240 align:middle line:84%
The rooftop is the last
frontier for the city.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.057 align:middle line:90%
And so we're putting--

00:36:21.057 --> 00:36:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>>That's true.

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.710 align:middle line:84%
We have potentials
for wind, for solar,

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:26.837 align:middle line:84%
for agriculture, all of
this on the rooftops.

00:36:26.837 --> 00:36:27.671 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hm.

00:36:27.671 --> 00:36:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>Interesting.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>So we are approaching,
for example,

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.510 align:middle line:84%
the city fathers right now of
Silicon Valley in Sunnyvale

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:36.160 align:middle line:84%
and saying, look, we
would like to cover

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:40.900 align:middle line:84%
the rooftops of Silicon
Valley with silicon,

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.780 align:middle line:84%
semiconductor
photovoltaic panels.

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:45.610 align:middle line:90%
And they're very interested.

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Because also what we could do is
we could shift an industry that

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.129 align:middle line:84%
was started on the
silicon chip, you know,

00:36:50.129 --> 00:36:53.300 align:middle line:84%
the computer field, can
now go on to the rooftops.

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:58.540 align:middle line:84%
It would lead to the-- we
could produce jobs and keep

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.020 align:middle line:90%
this innovation at home.

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:04.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the US has produced
so many great breakthroughs

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.720 align:middle line:84%
and then has transferred them
to other countries, Japan

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.060 align:middle line:90%
or Europe.

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And we have been the leader
in the photovoltaic area,

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:17.820 align:middle line:84%
and even in wind, and
we need to employ it now

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:22.510 align:middle line:84%
because so much of our
talent and resources

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:25.010 align:middle line:84%
are being outsourced
to other countries

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:28.390 align:middle line:84%
that unless we have some
manufacturing base in the US,

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:31.770 align:middle line:84%
we're going to end up being
just a service economy.

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:35.870 align:middle line:84%
A nation of pizza deliveries
and of video rental stores.

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:37.120 align:middle line:90%
No economic base.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.110 align:middle line:90%
No manufacturing base at all.

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:42.670 align:middle line:90%
So that's how I see it.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:44.450 align:middle line:84%
I look at the
rooftops of the city

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:48.450 align:middle line:84%
and I see those
are all collectors.

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:50.890 align:middle line:84%
We could just mount
them on the roof

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:56.050 align:middle line:84%
and collect energy and
not worry about it.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:58.530 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>Let's take it a
step further and go

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.010 align:middle line:84%
into the more
exotic technologies,

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:04.480 align:middle line:90%
because some of these do exist.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hm.

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>>What does our future look
like for what are casually

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:13.460 align:middle line:84%
called, and sometimes literally
called, free energy devices?

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:16.151 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hm.

00:38:16.151 --> 00:38:16.650 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.231 align:middle line:84%
>>I know you're privy to
information across the board

00:38:19.231 --> 00:38:20.730 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
technologies, and I

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:23.660 align:middle line:84%
know some you're not
at liberty to share.

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:25.620 align:middle line:84%
But for what you
can share, can you

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.170 align:middle line:90%
tell us what lies ahead there?

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where it
gets really exciting.

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me first
say that I differ

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.830 align:middle line:84%
from a lot of my colleagues in
the free energy field in that I

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:41.430 align:middle line:84%
first have to say that all these
renewable energy devices are

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:43.110 align:middle line:90%
free energy devices, OK?

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:45.160 align:middle line:90%
The energy is free.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:45.840 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.190 align:middle line:84%
We have not taxed
the sunshine yet,

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:52.060 align:middle line:90%
and we've not taxed the wind.

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Every country has 1,000 watts
of solar energy impinging

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:02.660 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of any
surface on the planet.

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:05.520 align:middle line:84%
With pollution, it's
down to about 800 watts.

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's 800 watts
of solar energy

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:11.420 align:middle line:84%
is available to
anybody one square

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:15.305 align:middle line:90%
meter of solar radiation.

00:39:15.305 --> 00:39:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>>That said.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>>The energy is free, but the
devices to harness it are not,

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:22.360 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.300 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, we have to say
that because even the devices

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:31.400 align:middle line:84%
that employ free energy are
going to cost some money.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:35.360 align:middle line:84%
But they will tap into an
infinite amount of energy

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.720 align:middle line:90%
and they'll work 24 hours a day.

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, you're talking about
the alternative technologies

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:46.337 align:middle line:84%
you've already discussed, or the
quote, "free energy" devices?

00:39:46.337 --> 00:39:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, I'm saying that
we have to be really

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:50.540 align:middle line:84%
clear about the
word free energy.

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:51.040 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>>And I just defined
why yes, it's free,

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.710 align:middle line:84%
but the device to
harness it is not free.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:58.918 align:middle line:84%
>>Now the area that
we're talking about now,

00:39:58.918 --> 00:40:00.370 align:middle line:84%
define what that
means when we're

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:06.324 align:middle line:84%
going into now maybe a little
more distant future, the more

00:40:06.324 --> 00:40:08.141 align:middle line:90%
exotic technologies.

00:40:08.141 --> 00:40:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:12.500 align:middle line:84%
The exotic
technologies basically

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:16.322 align:middle line:84%
describe what was
described to us by Maxwell,

00:40:16.322 --> 00:40:20.000 align:middle line:84%
who was the originator of
electromagnetic theory.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And there is a kind of world
view that is three-dimensional,

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:29.080 align:middle line:84%
we see it as a
three-dimensional world.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And so the original equations
for electromagnetic theory

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:37.260 align:middle line:90%
had four components, not three.

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:41.470 align:middle line:84%
It was four-dimensional,
it was Quaternary.

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And over the years, we have
removed one of those elements

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:50.400 align:middle line:84%
from the original equations
because it was not understood.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.550 align:middle line:84%
It was understood by
scientists like Nikola Tesla,

00:40:53.550 --> 00:41:01.750 align:middle line:84%
for example, and a few others
who began to see first of all,

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:04.750 align:middle line:84%
it describes a whole other
way of looking at the world.

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:09.670 align:middle line:84%
We are seeing--
it's like you can

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:14.180 align:middle line:84%
see the world like a glass of
water that the glass of water

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:17.600 align:middle line:84%
is either half
full or half empty.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:23.010 align:middle line:84%
It all depends on your
attitude about abundance.

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And so it turns out if we use
the new vision of the world,

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and the old vision
from Maxwell and Tesla,

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:34.530 align:middle line:84%
there is no such
thing as empty space.

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:37.080 align:middle line:84%
There's no such
thing as empty space.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Even this right here
is loaded, impinged,

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:46.050 align:middle line:84%
saturated with electromagnetic
waves, magnetic fields,

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:48.240 align:middle line:90%
everything you can imagine.

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps different dimensions
are happening right now

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:52.820 align:middle line:84%
in this space that
we call space.

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:58.440 align:middle line:84%
So if we can see
that and we can see

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:03.830 align:middle line:84%
that we can tap into what's
called the plenum, which

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:07.140 align:middle line:84%
represents the space,
then we could literally

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:11.330 align:middle line:84%
extract energy
directly from space.

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:14.100 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of the
theoretical view on it, OK.

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:19.720 align:middle line:84%
Operationally, what
we can do right away

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:26.490 align:middle line:84%
is look at motors, OK,
motors and generators.

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:28.480 align:middle line:90%
A motor is a generator.

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:34.220 align:middle line:84%
When a generator runs, there's
an electromagnetic force

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:39.020 align:middle line:84%
that is opposite to
what's happening.

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So like if I take a
motor and I spin it

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.740 align:middle line:84%
faster than it's
designed to run,

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:46.870 align:middle line:90%
energy flows out of the motor.

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:48.651 align:middle line:84%
And there are now some
harmonic circuits,

00:42:48.651 --> 00:42:50.150 align:middle line:84%
which have been
known for some time,

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:52.470 align:middle line:84%
but they're now being
operationally put

00:42:52.470 --> 00:43:05.720 align:middle line:84%
into place where we can actually
get anywhere from 200 to 300

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:09.490 align:middle line:84%
times the energy out of a
system that we're actually

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:10.770 align:middle line:90%
putting into it.

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:14.230 align:middle line:84%
So we might put 2
amps into a device

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:16.060 align:middle line:84%
like this, a motor
generator device--

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>Get 600 back.

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:20.250 align:middle line:90%
>>Correct.

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:23.270 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>>Those are called
over-unity devices?

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>>Over-unity, mm-hm.

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And most things are
operating below unity.

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Our inverter circuits, our
alternative energy circuits,

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:37.890 align:middle line:84%
actually improve
what's called the power

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:42.710 align:middle line:90%
factor of existing grids, so--

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>>And there are devices like
this that already exist?

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>>And the interesting
part I find

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:55.590 align:middle line:84%
is that wherever this
technology exists,

00:43:55.590 --> 00:44:01.090 align:middle line:84%
there seems to be a huge amount
of drama, secrecy, intrigue,

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:03.381 align:middle line:90%
usually on the darker side.

00:44:03.381 --> 00:44:06.330 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hm.

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>It's as though there's
a vested interest

00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:15.640 align:middle line:84%
in these technologies never
seeing the light of day.

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hm.

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>>Why is this?

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:19.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it seems
like a no-brainer,

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:20.915 align:middle line:84%
but if you care to
take a stab at it,

00:44:20.915 --> 00:44:23.370 align:middle line:90%
why do you think this is?

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>>There are definitely
vested interests.

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:27.470 align:middle line:84%
There are vested interests
in the fossil fuel

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:29.875 align:middle line:90%
economy, which is huge.

00:44:29.875 --> 00:44:32.910 align:middle line:90%


00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:35.480 align:middle line:84%
The power industry is
the biggest power trip

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.510 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:38.160 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And with the interlocking
of corporations

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:48.750 align:middle line:84%
that have the capability
of taking over governments

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:52.840 align:middle line:84%
with the military
industrial involvement,

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:55.491 align:middle line:90%
these are major forces.

00:44:55.491 --> 00:45:00.655 align:middle line:84%
>>It seems these come to
bear upon the lone inventor

00:45:00.655 --> 00:45:04.400 align:middle line:90%
of these types of devices.

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>It's a different kind
of industry, you know.

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:13.950 align:middle line:84%
The fossil fuel economy and
everything it represents

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:17.230 align:middle line:84%
is centralized, it's
heavily controlled.

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:18.930 align:middle line:90%
Everything is metered.

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
carefully controlled.

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And these other devices that
we've been talking about today

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:27.110 align:middle line:90%
are decentralized.

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:30.580 align:middle line:84%
They don't need any
kind of control.

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:32.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm saying there's no--

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>>Don't need regulations.

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>>No regulation, per se.

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:40.679 align:middle line:84%
And so it threatens the
centralized power systems.

00:45:40.679 --> 00:45:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And what we have been doing
over the years is basically

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:46.330 align:middle line:84%
building this partnership
through alternative energy

00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:50.730 align:middle line:84%
so that as we work with the
utility, we make it very clear,

00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:54.520 align:middle line:84%
gentlemen, we are
co-generating with you.

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.720 align:middle line:84%
We're not trying to
take over this utility.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.410 align:middle line:90%
We are co-generating with you.

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Look at us as your little
brothers and sisters.

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:05.373 align:middle line:84%
>>Is this why you do
things in the manner

00:46:05.373 --> 00:46:06.990 align:middle line:90%
that you're doing it?

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Take it steady, this is
the transitional period.

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:20.255 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to require that the
same sociopolitical structure

00:46:20.255 --> 00:46:22.945 align:middle line:84%
that is vested in oil and
controls that industry,

00:46:22.945 --> 00:46:24.320 align:middle line:84%
are they going to
have to own all

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:26.120 align:middle line:84%
the chips in the
new technologies

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.380 align:middle line:84%
before we're ever
going to see it?

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:32.315 align:middle line:84%
Or is there any way that
the people, the consumer

00:46:32.315 --> 00:46:37.450 align:middle line:84%
can demand this in such a way
that it gives a possibility

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:41.080 align:middle line:84%
for the growth of these
exotic technologies,

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:44.850 align:middle line:84%
even in the face of what
we understand the power

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:47.460 align:middle line:90%
industry to be right now?

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>We were always hoping
that eventually we

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:57.790 align:middle line:84%
could convince
Saudi Arabia, look,

00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:59.580 align:middle line:84%
you're only going
to have so much oil.

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.220 align:middle line:84%
You only have so much
oil left, maybe enough

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.500 align:middle line:90%
for another 20 years.

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Then what?

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:06.790 align:middle line:90%
You will have used it up.

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Why not invest some of the oil
assets in alternative energies?

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have
technologies where we

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:16.470 align:middle line:84%
could re-green the
deserts of the world.

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:18.880 align:middle line:84%
We can pull water
out of the air.

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:24.790 align:middle line:84%
We could convert Saudi Arabia--
convert the sunshine that

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:29.150 align:middle line:84%
falls on the Saudi
Arabian Desert to energy.

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>>And this isn't sci-fi.

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:31.820 align:middle line:90%
This technology exists.

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And actually, a lot of
people took us up on it.

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:39.600 align:middle line:84%
A lot of corporations
now have bought

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:41.610 align:middle line:90%
the photovoltaic companies.

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:49.220 align:middle line:84%
We have Royal Dutch Shell
bought Siemens solar division.

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:53.070 align:middle line:90%


00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:56.040 align:middle line:84%
SolarX was bought by
British Petroleum,

00:47:56.040 --> 00:48:01.400 align:middle line:84%
or it's called
Beyond Petroleum, BP.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:06.409 align:middle line:84%
And several other purchases
have been by oil companies.

00:48:06.409 --> 00:48:07.950 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand,
you can look at that

00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:12.280 align:middle line:90%
as like, well, we're losing it.

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:16.130 align:middle line:84%
I look at it more as, great,
I'm glad that the oil industries

00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:18.620 align:middle line:84%
are embracing these
renewable energy sources.

00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:21.950 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they, through
their deep pockets,

00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:24.930 align:middle line:84%
can really drive the
price down because it's

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:26.310 align:middle line:90%
been very expensive.

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And we need to make
it really effective

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:31.742 align:middle line:90%
so that anybody can afford it.

00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:32.825 align:middle line:90%
It's a little bit of both.

00:48:32.825 --> 00:48:37.210 align:middle line:90%


00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:44.200 align:middle line:84%
These other devices, these
exotic energy devices I think

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:48.512 align:middle line:84%
are really going to change
the rules of the game.

00:48:48.512 --> 00:48:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>How will they
make it out, though?

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:54.040 align:middle line:90%
Let's put it this way.

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.960 align:middle line:84%
What as consumers
can we do to see

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:03.920 align:middle line:84%
that these technologies surface
and become available to us?

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:07.920 align:middle line:90%
Can we do anything?

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>Actually from
the inside, whoever

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:17.140 align:middle line:84%
has an idea for
producing power wins, OK?

00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:18.642 align:middle line:90%
We are so up against the wall.

00:49:18.642 --> 00:49:20.850 align:middle line:84%
The people who are the most
up against the wall right

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:22.670 align:middle line:90%
now are the Japanese.

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:26.380 align:middle line:84%
In Japan, they have
no natural resources.

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:29.440 align:middle line:84%
They have no petroleum
whatsoever on their land,

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.850 align:middle line:84%
so everything has to
be imported to them.

00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And from my sources,
I already know

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:39.330 align:middle line:84%
that they are employing some
of these devices in their power

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:40.524 align:middle line:90%
grid.

00:49:40.524 --> 00:49:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>>That's exciting.

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:45.995 align:middle line:84%
>>They're totally embracing
the hydrogen economy.

00:49:45.995 --> 00:49:48.400 align:middle line:84%
They're saying,
yeah, hydrogen, sure.

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:51.520 align:middle line:90%
But hydrogen is not a fuel.

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Hydrogen has to be
made by some energy.

00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to be made
from fossil fuels or solar?

00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:58.606 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to
do solar hydrogen?

00:49:58.606 --> 00:50:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to do energy from
the wind or from-- you know,

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.340 align:middle line:84%
it takes electricity
to make hydrogen.

00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>>Mm-hm.

00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>>And so I know that there are
already energy amplifiers being

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:13.880 align:middle line:84%
employed that increase the
output of those existing power

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:18.880 align:middle line:84%
plants for creating
the hydrogen economy.

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:23.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure how-- I think
the best-- I would say this.

00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Speaking for the consumers
for a minute, which we all

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:32.170 align:middle line:84%
are, whenever you buy
something, whenever any of us

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:35.220 align:middle line:90%
buy something, we cast a vote.

00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:40.660 align:middle line:84%
We cast a vote, we support some
company and their products.

00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And we should be selective
in what we spend our money on

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:46.430 align:middle line:90%
and that's our vote.

00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:50.200 align:middle line:84%
If we support a company
that has bad labor policies

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:53.050 align:middle line:84%
and uses slave labor
in China somewhere,

00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:54.450 align:middle line:90%
we are supporting that company.

00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:56.780 align:middle line:90%
We're supporting that action.

00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:03.360 align:middle line:84%
So I would say--
all we've ever said

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.860 align:middle line:84%
is just buy some
of our products.

00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Buy some of these new
energy technologies.

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.700 align:middle line:90%
They have warranties.

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:15.500 align:middle line:84%
It's like, this is not
experimental any more.

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:16.655 align:middle line:90%
These are UL approved.

00:51:16.655 --> 00:51:19.460 align:middle line:90%


00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Just get yourself to
be more self-reliant.

00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:29.050 align:middle line:84%
You can feel more
secure in your life

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:31.810 align:middle line:84%
by knowing what you
spend your money on.

00:51:31.810 --> 00:51:35.520 align:middle line:84%
If you spend your
money on lousy food,

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:38.640 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have an
expensive medical bill so

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.730 align:middle line:90%
think ahead.

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And if there's any way that
you can tighten up your house

00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:48.240 align:middle line:84%
and make it warmer, you
will spend less on energy.

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:51.230 align:middle line:84%
If you want to co-generate,
that's available too.

00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:52.840 align:middle line:84%
If you have a
problem financially,

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:55.260 align:middle line:84%
there are now leasing
programs available

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:57.190 align:middle line:84%
so the equipment
can be leased you.

00:51:57.190 --> 00:52:00.800 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to buy it
if you can't afford it.

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:04.980 align:middle line:84%
This is something that we're
working with municipalities

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:06.770 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:10.130 align:middle line:84%
I was going to just make a
little comment about how people

00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:15.350 align:middle line:84%
can participate,
invest, or become

00:52:15.350 --> 00:52:20.140 align:middle line:84%
buyers of these
new power systems.

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:23.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, how they can be part
of this declaration of energy

00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:28.510 align:middle line:84%
independence from the
Mideast and Mideast oil.

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And we now have a program
together cold Enviro-Lease

00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:40.340 align:middle line:84%
where, let's say you're
a city, or your a school

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:44.300 align:middle line:84%
or your a library
and you wish to begin

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:47.270 align:middle line:84%
to use-- you want a
photovoltaic power system,

00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:50.850 align:middle line:84%
or even a whole new system
that we talked about.

00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:56.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what we do is we
basically go to your school,

00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.930 align:middle line:84%
we look at your power
bill and we say,

00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:01.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, it looks like you're
using $2,000 or $3,000

00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:03.960 align:middle line:84%
a month of power
to run your school

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:06.940 align:middle line:84%
or to run the City Hall,
whatever it might be.

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And so we say, we will cover
the roof of your school

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:15.340 align:middle line:84%
with our photovoltaic
power equipment

00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:18.650 align:middle line:84%
and we will set up a
leasing arrangement with you

00:53:18.650 --> 00:53:22.840 align:middle line:84%
where you will lease this
equipment from us for the cost

00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:24.465 align:middle line:84%
that you're paying
now for electricity.

00:53:24.465 --> 00:53:28.520 align:middle line:90%


00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:30.950 align:middle line:84%
This leasing arrangement will
be in place for 10 years.

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:34.660 align:middle line:84%
At the end of 10 years, we will
sell the system to you for $1.

00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:37.430 align:middle line:90%


00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:41.260 align:middle line:84%
How much you have to pay
to have this on your roof?

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Zero, because we have investors
who believe in the children.

00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:50.660 align:middle line:84%
They believe that what
it's all about is the kids.

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And they are willing to finance
and pay for the equipment

00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:55.090 align:middle line:90%
as a leasing program.

00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:57.970 align:middle line:90%


00:53:57.970 --> 00:54:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>>Sounds like that would
be hard to turn down.

00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And these types of
programs do exist.

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>>They exist now.

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>>So really it's a
process of education.

00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:10.290 align:middle line:84%
Most people have no idea
what technology is out there.

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And, so really, it's up
to us as the consumer

00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:17.220 align:middle line:84%
to begin cruising the
net, educating ourselves

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:20.700 align:middle line:84%
on which technologies
are already up available

00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:23.780 align:middle line:84%
and running, what the
future holds and then start

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:25.850 align:middle line:90%
demanding, investing?

00:54:25.850 --> 00:54:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:29.560 align:middle line:84%
It's usually a fairly
large capital cost,

00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:31.440 align:middle line:84%
and so we're saying
there are other ways,

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.580 align:middle line:90%
like leasing the equipment.

00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:34.165 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can lease
a car, you can

00:54:34.165 --> 00:54:36.920 align:middle line:84%
lease camera equipment,
anything you need.

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:41.340 align:middle line:84%
That's another way to
participate and join

00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:44.404 align:middle line:90%
the energy revolution.

00:54:44.404 --> 00:54:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you, Reinhold.

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>Check out Reinhold's website
for more detailed information

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.970 align:middle line:84%
on all of the
incredible developments

00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:54.360 align:middle line:84%
in the world of
alternative energy sources.

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Until next time,
thanks for watching.
