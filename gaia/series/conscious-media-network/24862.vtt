00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:03.089
<v ->Drunvalo Melchizedek has been educating people around</v>

2
00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:05.671
the world for a couple of decades about the nature

3
00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:08.529
of geometry as universal principals that support life

4
00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:10.319
here on earth and elsewhere.

5
00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.309
He did this through his Flower of Life workshops.

6
00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.250
Today, Drunvalo has been called by indigenous elders

7
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.729
from around the world, to help them get their true

8
00:00:18.729 --> 00:00:21.429
messages out to the world, regarding this profound

9
00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:22.829
period of time.

10
00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:24.989
They believe it's important that people understand

11
00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.108
that we can change the outcome for ourselves through

12
00:00:28.108 --> 00:00:29.919
our own consciousness.

13
00:00:39.968 --> 00:00:42.068
So this time you're off on a real adventure,

14
00:00:42.068 --> 00:00:44.628
and this is an adventure that took place over 25 years

15
00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:46.967
or so in your newest book "Serpent of Light",

16
00:00:46.967 --> 00:00:50.268
and obviously you're not going to slow down for a long time

17
00:00:50.268 --> 00:00:52.767
now because you've stirred a lot of energy up by actually

18
00:00:52.767 --> 00:00:56.287
revealing some of the events that you went through,

19
00:00:56.287 --> 00:00:58.557
the initiations throughout the planet.

20
00:00:58.847 --> 00:01:01.727
I would like to talk about that book and then move it

21
00:01:01.727 --> 00:01:05.218
forward into what we're looking at in the very near future.

22
00:01:05.487 --> 00:01:08.507
So, can we talk a little bit about, I wanna know why

23
00:01:08.507 --> 00:01:11.168
you decided to finally reveal all of the things you've

24
00:01:11.168 --> 00:01:14.547
been through around the world with these earth rituals

25
00:01:14.547 --> 00:01:16.518
with indigenous people.

26
00:01:16.947 --> 00:01:18.868
Almost no one has had the invite you've had into

27
00:01:18.868 --> 00:01:20.437
the indigenous circles.

28
00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:25.547
<v ->Well, it really was my publisher because when they</v>

29
00:01:26.487 --> 00:01:29.867
looked at everything that was possible,

30
00:01:29.867 --> 00:01:32.457
there's lots of books that are possible.

31
00:01:33.487 --> 00:01:37.127
That one is so pertinent to this moment, to right now

32
00:01:37.127 --> 00:01:39.957
that they were the one's that asked me to do that.

33
00:01:40.547 --> 00:01:43.847
At first I felt a little funny about that you know

34
00:01:43.847 --> 00:01:46.507
because it was very personal,

35
00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:49.007
and then they talked me into it and I said okay,

36
00:01:49.007 --> 00:01:50.367
well alright.

37
00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:55.367
But now that it's done it is, it's changing.

38
00:01:57.947 --> 00:02:01.107
The indigenous people have been reading this book

39
00:02:01.107 --> 00:02:04.707
and so they're responding to it and they're responding

40
00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:08.147
very positively but with more energy than I've ever

41
00:02:08.147 --> 00:02:09.928
seen before.

42
00:02:09.928 --> 00:02:12.077
And so, this is...

43
00:02:14.707 --> 00:02:16.927
What's happened since that book has been,

44
00:02:16.927 --> 00:02:19.027
the manuscript has been turned in,

45
00:02:19.027 --> 00:02:22.267
it was actually turned in, in June of 2007,

46
00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:26.927
in July of 2007 before it was even published,

47
00:02:26.927 --> 00:02:31.067
it started to speed up and so it's good,

48
00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:32.268
it's a good thing.

49
00:02:32.268 --> 00:02:37.268
I mean all this, what happens in those worlds,

50
00:02:37.527 --> 00:02:42.507
are crucial to what happens in our worlds and people

51
00:02:42.507 --> 00:02:45.197
don't really understand that.

52
00:02:45.907 --> 00:02:48.457
You know I like to give a little...

53
00:02:48.988 --> 00:02:50.447
I don't know what you call it.

54
00:02:50.447 --> 00:02:53.787
A little story to try to explain why the indigenous world

55
00:02:53.787 --> 00:02:55.107
is so important.

56
00:02:55.107 --> 00:02:56.087
<v Voiceover>Please.</v>

57
00:02:56.087 --> 00:02:58.187
<v ->Because most of the people just say, oh they're just</v>

58
00:02:58.187 --> 00:03:01.527
primitive people and they don't know anything

59
00:03:01.527 --> 00:03:04.627
and it's obsolete and it doesn't have any effect on this

60
00:03:04.627 --> 00:03:06.417
new technological world.

61
00:03:07.027 --> 00:03:10.907
But, that's not what we see in the sacred geometrical

62
00:03:10.907 --> 00:03:14.788
world, which is the world that is underlying everything

63
00:03:14.788 --> 00:03:16.514
that we are in.

64
00:03:17.005 --> 00:03:20.985
Underneath our world is a geometrical patterns

65
00:03:20.985 --> 00:03:25.164
and when you go into the carbon based life forms

66
00:03:25.164 --> 00:03:28.225
and the geometry behind that, there's something there

67
00:03:28.225 --> 00:03:29.774
that's very clear.

68
00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:34.745
That is when a biological life form expands into

69
00:03:34.745 --> 00:03:37.564
a higher level of consciousness.

70
00:03:37.564 --> 00:03:41.424
They can't do it unless they're connected to the past,

71
00:03:41.424 --> 00:03:43.645
and you can see it in plant growth.

72
00:03:43.645 --> 00:03:48.124
The plants very often use the Fibonacci sequence

73
00:03:48.124 --> 00:03:51.904
which is zero, one, one, two, three, five, eight,

74
00:03:51.904 --> 00:03:55.604
13, 21, 34, 55 it goes on and on.

75
00:03:55.604 --> 00:03:58.084
But what it really is, if you just take three simple

76
00:03:58.084 --> 00:04:00.684
numbers like three, five and eight, it's just that

77
00:04:00.684 --> 00:04:03.645
five adds to three and makes eight.

78
00:04:03.645 --> 00:04:06.584
And so the plant sitting at five...

79
00:04:06.584 --> 00:04:08.284
That's how many of them grow their leaves.

80
00:04:08.284 --> 00:04:10.224
They'll start out with one leaf then one, then two,

81
00:04:10.224 --> 00:04:12.224
then three, then five, then eight.

82
00:04:12.224 --> 00:04:15.184
And so the plant doesn't know where it's going,

83
00:04:15.184 --> 00:04:18.884
it's sitting at five leaves and it looks back at where

84
00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:21.185
it's last growth was, was three,

85
00:04:21.185 --> 00:04:23.624
which is kind of obsolete it's past that.

86
00:04:23.624 --> 00:04:26.464
But then it adds it together and then it knows where

87
00:04:26.464 --> 00:04:28.824
to go which is eight.

88
00:04:28.824 --> 00:04:32.894
The symbolism is exactly the same in human consciousness.

89
00:04:33.584 --> 00:04:36.865
If we do not connect with our ancient past,

90
00:04:36.865 --> 00:04:40.364
it's the memories, it's the wisdom of everything

91
00:04:40.364 --> 00:04:41.564
that happened.

92
00:04:41.564 --> 00:04:45.004
And we don't add that to our present day technological

93
00:04:45.004 --> 00:04:46.334
expansion.

94
00:04:46.644 --> 00:04:49.284
We'll be lost, we won't have any idea where we're going,

95
00:04:49.284 --> 00:04:51.634
and we won't be able to survive this.

96
00:04:51.884 --> 00:04:54.844
Where it's clear, we haven't added that in there,

97
00:04:54.844 --> 00:04:56.584
and we're killing our planet,

98
00:04:56.584 --> 00:04:58.524
and we're killing it fast.

99
00:04:58.524 --> 00:05:01.425
But if we were to add that wisdom of understanding

100
00:05:01.425 --> 00:05:04.924
like the concept of seven generations of never doing

101
00:05:04.924 --> 00:05:09.184
anything that would affect seven generations down

102
00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:11.884
the line, if we understood these kinds of things

103
00:05:11.884 --> 00:05:15.184
and they were incorporated into our way now,

104
00:05:15.184 --> 00:05:18.745
then we would be, we would know where we're going.

105
00:05:18.745 --> 00:05:21.004
We would know what do to and we would expand

106
00:05:21.004 --> 00:05:26.004
in a conscious way that would be safe and usable.

107
00:05:26.564 --> 00:05:28.124
<v Voiceover>That's very true.</v>

108
00:05:28.124 --> 00:05:31.464
One interview we did was really surprisingly refreshing.

109
00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:33.465
It was with a man named Shlomo Shoham

110
00:05:33.465 --> 00:05:37.324
who had been in the Israeli parliament,

111
00:05:37.324 --> 00:05:42.324
and he at that time had an oversight committee,

112
00:05:43.645 --> 00:05:46.205
and now he since retired from the position and it

113
00:05:46.205 --> 00:05:49.794
was staffed by a lot of young legal beagles.

114
00:05:50.628 --> 00:05:53.727
And the whole purpose of it was to evaluate every piece

115
00:05:53.727 --> 00:05:56.227
of legislation it had to pass through them as to

116
00:05:56.227 --> 00:05:58.717
it's affect to seven generations out.

117
00:05:58.808 --> 00:06:01.123
Which is the first time I've actually seen that employed

118
00:06:01.123 --> 00:06:02.623
in the modern world.

119
00:06:02.623 --> 00:06:06.144
But this is something that is intrinsic to the indigenous

120
00:06:06.144 --> 00:06:07.764
cultures.

121
00:06:07.764 --> 00:06:10.923
And so this is part of a Rupert Sheldrake

122
00:06:10.923 --> 00:06:13.853
morphogenetic fields it's all building on the past.

123
00:06:14.164 --> 00:06:15.443
<v ->Yes it is,</v>

124
00:06:15.443 --> 00:06:19.583
and we as a planet right now are ignoring it,

125
00:06:19.583 --> 00:06:20.963
in fact we're trying to.

126
00:06:20.963 --> 00:06:23.883
It's like genocide, we're trying to get rid of it.

127
00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:27.413
If we were to get rid of it, our life would be over,

128
00:06:27.423 --> 00:06:28.704
we would never make it.

129
00:06:28.704 --> 00:06:32.383
From my point of seeing it, we would never be able

130
00:06:32.383 --> 00:06:35.773
to make the expansion into the next level of consciousness.

131
00:06:36.363 --> 00:06:37.623
<v Voiceover>It's true and it seems as though we're</v>

132
00:06:37.623 --> 00:06:41.764
almost on a drunken binge of last minute consumption

133
00:06:41.764 --> 00:06:43.453
from every level.

134
00:06:44.063 --> 00:06:47.922
Trying to stave off the inevitable, which is responsibilty

135
00:06:47.922 --> 00:06:51.154
for what we shall inherit in the future.

136
00:06:51.803 --> 00:06:55.764
<v ->Yeah I mean, you know we thought this wasn't</v>

137
00:06:55.764 --> 00:06:57.603
gonna happen for a long time.

138
00:06:57.603 --> 00:07:00.023
Technological world thought, it wasn't gonna happen

139
00:07:00.023 --> 00:07:04.043
until we reached about 12 to 14 billion people in the world

140
00:07:04.043 --> 00:07:08.154
and it's not true, it's happening in half that number.

141
00:07:08.183 --> 00:07:11.303
Oil just went over 123 dollars a barrel and the consequences

142
00:07:11.303 --> 00:07:14.033
of where this is leading is huge.

143
00:07:14.383 --> 00:07:16.163
It's absolutely huge,

144
00:07:16.163 --> 00:07:20.763
and it wouldn't have to be this way if we had just

145
00:07:20.763 --> 00:07:24.613
lived our lives a little differently.

146
00:07:25.063 --> 00:07:28.643
Right now the indigenous people are basically using

147
00:07:28.643 --> 00:07:31.723
me to get out to the world, to try to get their

148
00:07:31.723 --> 00:07:34.923
understanding out because they realize it's crucial

149
00:07:34.923 --> 00:07:37.684
even in the Hopi Prophecy they knew they had to go

150
00:07:37.684 --> 00:07:40.463
to the United Nations and tell them these things,

151
00:07:40.463 --> 00:07:42.124
which they did.

152
00:07:42.124 --> 00:07:45.273
But it hasn't changed anything.

153
00:07:47.284 --> 00:07:49.493
<v Voiceover>Can we talk about the book?</v>

154
00:07:50.384 --> 00:07:52.403
Just kind of skim through it because it's too much

155
00:07:52.403 --> 00:07:54.433
to cover in this interview and get on to the next.

156
00:07:54.943 --> 00:07:58.483
The purpose for writing it the way you did,

157
00:07:58.483 --> 00:08:00.303
which I thought was brilliant of your publishers

158
00:08:00.303 --> 00:08:03.023
to suggest that you go really personal on it,

159
00:08:03.023 --> 00:08:04.163
and it's fun.

160
00:08:04.163 --> 00:08:06.884
It's a fun exciting inspirational journey.

161
00:08:06.884 --> 00:08:08.803
So can you give us a little hopscotch through

162
00:08:08.803 --> 00:08:11.884
what originally happened that called you into contact

163
00:08:11.884 --> 00:08:15.913
with the indigenous people and pick up a starting place.

164
00:08:16.384 --> 00:08:18.323
<v ->Oh well that's easy.</v>

165
00:08:18.323 --> 00:08:23.323
My last life, I remember every minute of it, every word

166
00:08:23.863 --> 00:08:26.483
that was spoken, every action that took place.

167
00:08:26.483 --> 00:08:31.483
I was born to the Taos Pueblo and so when right before

168
00:08:32.663 --> 00:08:36.963
I died in the Taos Pueblo, they left me a long list.

169
00:08:36.963 --> 00:08:40.484
If I wrote it out it would be a couple pages long

170
00:08:40.484 --> 00:08:45.484
of things that I had to do when I got here in this body,

171
00:08:45.843 --> 00:08:47.983
and I've been back to them.

172
00:08:47.983 --> 00:08:49.823
This wasn't even in this book there.

173
00:08:49.823 --> 00:08:51.883
I went back to them, they acknowledged all this,

174
00:08:51.883 --> 00:08:53.863
they knew my name which was Jionni,

175
00:08:53.863 --> 00:08:56.084
they knew everything about me.

176
00:08:56.084 --> 00:08:58.523
They told me our whole stories and I already knew it.

177
00:08:58.523 --> 00:09:02.883
And I had to begin with that list and it took me 14 years

178
00:09:02.883 --> 00:09:06.623
of going through that list of getting every single thing

179
00:09:06.623 --> 00:09:08.363
done, but one.

180
00:09:08.363 --> 00:09:10.323
There's one last thing, which won't happen until

181
00:09:10.323 --> 00:09:11.713
the very end.

182
00:09:13.184 --> 00:09:15.863
<v Voiceover>Can we start more toward the top of the list?</v>

183
00:09:15.863 --> 00:09:18.023
<v ->No, those are personal to the tribe.</v>

184
00:09:18.023 --> 00:09:20.723
I mean I even had to bury certain people in the ground

185
00:09:20.723 --> 00:09:21.923
and things.

186
00:09:21.923 --> 00:09:23.944
There were a lot that they knew...

187
00:09:23.944 --> 00:09:25.843
This was back in the 1890's when this list was made.

188
00:09:25.843 --> 00:09:26.843
<v Voiceover>Oh I see.</v>

189
00:09:26.843 --> 00:09:29.563
<v ->And so they knew everything that was coming up</v>

190
00:09:29.563 --> 00:09:30.913
in the future.

191
00:09:31.384 --> 00:09:33.983
But part of that was is that I was to assist other

192
00:09:33.983 --> 00:09:36.984
indigenous tribes around the world at this time,

193
00:09:36.984 --> 00:09:41.153
and so, I kind of don't have a choice.

194
00:09:41.863 --> 00:09:44.943
I have to do this because it's my dharma, it's what

195
00:09:44.943 --> 00:09:48.153
I have to do in my life.

196
00:09:52.183 --> 00:09:54.683
I just have to stay in the certain vibration that they've

197
00:09:54.683 --> 00:09:55.563
taught me.

198
00:09:55.563 --> 00:09:57.703
As long as I do, the tribes will accept that.

199
00:09:57.703 --> 00:09:59.383
<v Voiceover>But the calls came in unusual</v>

200
00:09:59.383 --> 00:10:02.463
and unexpected ways to you and then you set out.

201
00:10:02.463 --> 00:10:05.084
You listened, you bought the airline tickets and you

202
00:10:05.084 --> 00:10:06.303
showed up.

203
00:10:06.303 --> 00:10:07.523
<v ->Yeah.</v>

204
00:10:07.523 --> 00:10:11.423
That's still going on now, now that it's accelerated more.

205
00:10:11.423 --> 00:10:16.203
But the story that's behind there, the movement of

206
00:10:16.203 --> 00:10:21.203
the Kundalini from Tibet to Chile, and the completion

207
00:10:22.583 --> 00:10:25.633
of the grid around the earth.

208
00:10:27.284 --> 00:10:30.883
A lot of people have not talked about the Kundalini

209
00:10:30.883 --> 00:10:33.983
because that was kept very secret.

210
00:10:33.983 --> 00:10:37.343
But the grid that's around the earth, that's in books

211
00:10:37.343 --> 00:10:41.264
and a lot of people are aware of that thing.

212
00:10:41.264 --> 00:10:44.504
By the way that was born into the world on

213
00:10:44.504 --> 00:10:47.113
January 20...

214
00:10:47.923 --> 00:10:49.703
The day of the eclipse I think it was...

215
00:10:49.703 --> 00:10:52.483
I have to go check, it was either the 24th, 5th or 6th.

216
00:10:52.483 --> 00:10:54.183
I don't remember, of this year.

217
00:10:54.183 --> 00:10:55.383
<v Voiceover>Of this year yeah.</v>

218
00:10:55.383 --> 00:10:58.503
<v ->And so the conception of that grid was 13,200 years</v>

219
00:10:58.503 --> 00:11:02.443
to the conception of it and the birth took about a month.

220
00:11:02.443 --> 00:11:07.443
It was between the lunar eclipse in January where

221
00:11:08.583 --> 00:11:11.303
the shadow went right over the Polynesian mountains

222
00:11:11.303 --> 00:11:13.303
and there we were in Moriya when this took place

223
00:11:13.303 --> 00:11:15.173
with all the elders there.

224
00:11:17.164 --> 00:11:21.063
When the final edge of the birth was here in Sedona

225
00:11:21.063 --> 00:11:23.883
where the shadow went right over Sedona,

226
00:11:23.883 --> 00:11:28.883
and the grid is now alive and conscious.

227
00:11:31.083 --> 00:11:32.723
This changes everything.

228
00:11:32.723 --> 00:11:34.303
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about that, what that means.</v>

229
00:11:34.303 --> 00:11:35.483
What the implications are.

230
00:11:35.483 --> 00:11:38.533
<v ->Well it's as big as you can get just about.</v>

231
00:11:39.403 --> 00:11:43.683
The Kundalini had to move first and it moved

232
00:11:43.683 --> 00:11:48.683
and it was in place in Chile by sometime in 2002.

233
00:11:48.963 --> 00:11:53.963
It got passed Panama in 2001 but it moved all over

234
00:11:54.503 --> 00:11:56.763
South America and finally settled.

235
00:11:56.763 --> 00:11:59.863
That's where those 112 tribes are sitting there in a circle,

236
00:11:59.863 --> 00:12:02.283
which they're still there right now.

237
00:12:02.283 --> 00:12:04.703
They're holding that space 'cause to them it's

238
00:12:04.703 --> 00:12:08.833
the most sacred thing in thousands and thousands of years.

239
00:12:08.923 --> 00:12:10.744
<v Voiceover>Lets back up a bit before the grid and talk</v>

240
00:12:10.744 --> 00:12:14.064
about the Kundalini having been present in Tibet

241
00:12:14.064 --> 00:12:16.563
and what that has meant throughout history and now

242
00:12:16.563 --> 00:12:20.473
what it means to have moved halfway around the world.

243
00:12:21.963 --> 00:12:26.963
<v ->Well when it moved into Tibet which was 13,000 years ago,</v>

244
00:12:27.503 --> 00:12:32.503
and the Naacals out of which was the high priesthood

245
00:12:32.503 --> 00:12:34.183
out of Atlantis.

246
00:12:34.183 --> 00:12:36.463
A part of them went there.

247
00:12:36.463 --> 00:12:39.463
The other part of them by the way,

248
00:12:39.463 --> 00:12:42.143
went into the Caribbean along with the Mayans

249
00:12:42.143 --> 00:12:45.304
and went to a little area which is now called Santa Marta

250
00:12:45.304 --> 00:12:47.203
in Colombia.

251
00:12:47.203 --> 00:12:50.403
Those people are called Kogi, Arhuacos, Wiwas

252
00:12:50.403 --> 00:12:51.883
and Kankuamos.

253
00:12:51.883 --> 00:12:56.883
But they are the original Naacals out of Atlantis

254
00:12:57.563 --> 00:13:00.163
and they told me so, eyeball to eyeball--

255
00:13:00.163 --> 00:13:01.683
<v Voiceover>This is found fascinating.</v>

256
00:13:01.683 --> 00:13:02.663
<v ->That they are.</v>

257
00:13:02.663 --> 00:13:05.683
The head of the Mayan Don Alejandro has also told

258
00:13:05.683 --> 00:13:08.583
me face to face that they are also from there,

259
00:13:08.583 --> 00:13:11.654
from Atlantis and so are the Hopi,

260
00:13:12.023 --> 00:13:14.449
and they've said the same thing.

261
00:13:14.479 --> 00:13:18.439
And so the history is about to be presented in a new light

262
00:13:18.439 --> 00:13:20.319
of who they are and where they came from,

263
00:13:20.319 --> 00:13:21.759
and they're all linked together.

264
00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:22.520
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

265
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.259
<v ->And they're about to all come together and meet</v>

266
00:13:24.259 --> 00:13:26.189
for the first time ever.

267
00:13:27.659 --> 00:13:30.159
Well not ever they did meet in Guatemala but not

268
00:13:30.159 --> 00:13:35.139
in a meeting where they actually discuss how they would

269
00:13:35.139 --> 00:13:36.769
function together.

270
00:13:37.659 --> 00:13:39.979
<v Voiceover>Okay, there's another stream.</v>

271
00:13:39.979 --> 00:13:41.440
We'll go there in a little bit.

272
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.479
<v ->There's a lot of them.</v>

273
00:13:42.479 --> 00:13:45.079
<v Voiceover>Okay so Tibet, 13,000 years ago--</v>

274
00:13:45.079 --> 00:13:50.079
<v ->By the time the Samirians started which we consider</v>

275
00:13:51.059 --> 00:13:54.459
the beginning of modern day culture, about six thousand

276
00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:55.989
years ago.

277
00:13:56.079 --> 00:13:59.699
The Naacals has already been into western Tibet

278
00:13:59.699 --> 00:14:02.299
and built the pyramid and were sitting there waiting

279
00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:06.039
for the rest of us to come along and using that energy

280
00:14:06.039 --> 00:14:10.169
to enlighten themselves with.

281
00:14:10.959 --> 00:14:13.899
And then they eventually became the Tibetans,

282
00:14:13.899 --> 00:14:15.659
or what we call the Tibetans.

283
00:14:15.659 --> 00:14:17.899
And sure there was influxes from India and other places

284
00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:21.489
but the original group was still there.

285
00:14:21.498 --> 00:14:23.479
<v Voiceover>And they held the knowledge for a long time.</v>

286
00:14:23.479 --> 00:14:27.699
<v ->They held the knowledge of what was prior to their,</v>

287
00:14:27.699 --> 00:14:29.409
of our history.

288
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:33.520
At which our entire human history is a little over

289
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.359
200,000 years.

290
00:14:35.359 --> 00:14:39.739
200,000, 200 and something years long when we were born.

291
00:14:44.199 --> 00:14:48.299
That was coming from Africa though Gondwanaland

292
00:14:48.299 --> 00:14:50.619
to Lemuria over to Atlantis and then to this present

293
00:14:50.619 --> 00:14:52.729
world that we're in now.

294
00:14:53.819 --> 00:14:56.339
<v Voiceover>So now with the Kundalini center,</v>

295
00:14:56.339 --> 00:14:59.489
with that energy moving from Tibet.

296
00:15:00.259 --> 00:15:03.959
How does this play into the fact of all of the tragedies

297
00:15:03.959 --> 00:15:06.649
that have been following the Tibetan people?

298
00:15:07.019 --> 00:15:08.889
<v ->It's linked.</v>

299
00:15:08.899 --> 00:15:11.460
This is what we were hinting at in the book.

300
00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:16.460
When the Kundalini began to move, even before then,

301
00:15:17.039 --> 00:15:22.039
the Pachamala in China began to try to break that apart

302
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.759
because from a real deep level, it now needs to be stopped

303
00:15:27.759 --> 00:15:30.209
and started in a new way.

304
00:15:31.099 --> 00:15:34.939
And so, even in India right now, if you were to do

305
00:15:34.939 --> 00:15:38.639
little research, you'll find out that almost all

306
00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:41.539
ashrams are being attacked over there right now.

307
00:15:41.539 --> 00:15:45.910
They're trying to split them apart and break them apart.

308
00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:48.299
Some of it's coming from government, some of it's

309
00:15:48.299 --> 00:15:49.960
coming from other levels,

310
00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:54.960
and so there is an attack on that whole spiritual region.

311
00:15:57.199 --> 00:15:59.879
Even in China, you got the Chinese now going after

312
00:15:59.879 --> 00:16:03.499
the Daoist and Qigong masters and everything else

313
00:16:03.499 --> 00:16:05.229
trying to stop them.

314
00:16:07.039 --> 00:16:09.539
<v Voiceover>So is this a natural side affect of</v>

315
00:16:09.539 --> 00:16:12.329
that energy having moved or what is this?

316
00:16:12.919 --> 00:16:15.319
<v ->It does appear that way, lets put it that way.</v>

317
00:16:15.319 --> 00:16:18.019
It does appear as though there is a deep resistance

318
00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:20.499
to stop all that over there.

319
00:16:20.499 --> 00:16:24.199
On the other side of the world in Chile and Boliva

320
00:16:24.199 --> 00:16:27.099
and Peru and surrounding countries around there,

321
00:16:27.099 --> 00:16:30.779
it's a whole different side of it.

322
00:16:30.779 --> 00:16:35.779
The people now are promoting it, promoting spirituality

323
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.649
and helping it.

324
00:16:38.699 --> 00:16:41.359
Shamans in like Peru,

325
00:16:43.519 --> 00:16:47.249
even 10 years ago, definitely 15 years ago,

326
00:16:48.319 --> 00:16:50.749
they had to be secretive.

327
00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:53.640
They had to be very careful because the people wouldn't

328
00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.649
allow them to be who they were.

329
00:16:57.579 --> 00:17:00.079
And that's all, that's gone now.

330
00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:02.539
They have complete support of everyone that they're

331
00:17:02.539 --> 00:17:04.869
told to really go for.

332
00:17:04.919 --> 00:17:07.159
<v Voiceover>So as fast as it's closing down in Tibet</v>

333
00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:08.699
and India, it's opening there.

334
00:17:08.699 --> 00:17:10.419
<v ->It's completely opening there.</v>

335
00:17:10.419 --> 00:17:12.639
<v Voiceover>Okay so with that movement that really</v>

336
00:17:12.639 --> 00:17:15.959
was given birth to as you say in late January of this year,

337
00:17:15.959 --> 00:17:18.379
the final formation.

338
00:17:18.379 --> 00:17:20.579
Lets talk about what that means when the grid has been

339
00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:22.169
fully formed again.

340
00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:26.639
<v ->Well now that it's been fully formed and birthed,</v>

341
00:17:26.639 --> 00:17:30.719
it's human consciousness and it went through conception,

342
00:17:30.719 --> 00:17:33.659
it went through birth and now it is a baby,

343
00:17:33.659 --> 00:17:35.359
and it is living thing.

344
00:17:35.359 --> 00:17:37.400
It's a living field that's around the earth.

345
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.079
What this means is that people that have been trying

346
00:17:40.079 --> 00:17:45.079
to do their work and their dharma whatever it is,

347
00:17:46.759 --> 00:17:49.859
whatever they're trying to do whatever it is,

348
00:17:49.859 --> 00:17:54.339
there's been a certain resistance to it because things

349
00:17:54.339 --> 00:17:55.999
weren't completed.

350
00:17:55.999 --> 00:17:58.379
Now they're completed, we might as well be

351
00:17:58.379 --> 00:18:01.439
on a different planet because everything is going

352
00:18:01.439 --> 00:18:04.690
to accelerate spiritually very fast.

353
00:18:04.979 --> 00:18:07.779
It's gonna just keep going up and up and it's not

354
00:18:07.779 --> 00:18:09.619
gonna stop.

355
00:18:09.619 --> 00:18:11.100
There's nothing to stop it.

356
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.700
The governments have tried to stop it, they've done

357
00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.360
all kinds of things to try to stop it before it was birthed,

358
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.899
they tried to kill it.

359
00:18:16.899 --> 00:18:19.859
They tried to kill this living thing, that's what they

360
00:18:19.859 --> 00:18:24.859
were doing in the French Polynesian some years back,

361
00:18:25.079 --> 00:18:27.759
were blowing neutron bombs up in the ocean there.

362
00:18:27.759 --> 00:18:29.679
They were actually blowing them up right in the axis

363
00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:32.629
in the grid itself, hoping it would destroy the grid.

364
00:18:33.219 --> 00:18:37.180
But as they found out, now she just got stronger

365
00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:38.791
and more powerful.

366
00:18:40.959 --> 00:18:45.959
Now it's happening and now the world has not just

367
00:18:48.939 --> 00:18:52.089
an opportunity, it is an opportunity.

368
00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:57.580
But people that are focusing on spiritual life,

369
00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:02.369
on their breath and their connection to all life everywhere.

370
00:19:03.099 --> 00:19:06.339
Every time they try to do something in the world,

371
00:19:06.339 --> 00:19:09.799
it's just gonna be supported by the world.

372
00:19:09.799 --> 00:19:13.059
It's gonna get stronger and easier and that side of life

373
00:19:13.059 --> 00:19:16.559
is just gonna keep growing until it's actually stronger,

374
00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:19.719
way stronger than the governments and the religions

375
00:19:19.719 --> 00:19:22.349
and everything else that we have developed before.

376
00:19:23.159 --> 00:19:26.159
<v Voiceover>Well this is good.</v>

377
00:19:26.159 --> 00:19:27.519
This is very good.

378
00:19:27.519 --> 00:19:29.479
Lets talk about that and talk about what the Mayan

379
00:19:29.479 --> 00:19:32.589
and what Hopi and some of the other indigenous people

380
00:19:32.679 --> 00:19:34.719
you've been meeting with through the years, have to say

381
00:19:34.719 --> 00:19:38.019
about this transition period over the next year or two.

382
00:19:38.019 --> 00:19:40.099
And I just wanna add something going back,

383
00:19:40.099 --> 00:19:42.519
for those people who have not yet read the book,

384
00:19:42.519 --> 00:19:45.499
that this adventure of yours, as I put it, it's actually

385
00:19:45.499 --> 00:19:50.499
a spiritual odyssey that really took you to indigenous

386
00:19:51.779 --> 00:19:55.399
regions around the world not even knowing with groups

387
00:19:55.399 --> 00:19:57.599
of people gathering what you were there for unitl

388
00:19:57.599 --> 00:19:59.219
you got there often.

389
00:19:59.219 --> 00:20:02.299
And then the people would show up exactly as told,

390
00:20:02.299 --> 00:20:05.659
and then the ceremony and the purpose of your being there

391
00:20:05.659 --> 00:20:07.160
would be revealed.

392
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:11.429
I mean, what a beautiful job of listening you did.

393
00:20:11.539 --> 00:20:15.199
<v ->Well really I'm just being used and that's okay.</v>

394
00:20:15.199 --> 00:20:18.459
I mean that's what my purpose is as...

395
00:20:18.459 --> 00:20:21.989
I understand that and they understand it.

396
00:20:22.239 --> 00:20:25.559
I'm not trying to become part of their tribes or anything

397
00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:26.539
else like those.

398
00:20:26.539 --> 00:20:28.879
Sometimes they initiate me into their tribes but,

399
00:20:28.879 --> 00:20:33.879
I know what I am, I'm a white man, I'm here I'm doing this

400
00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.390
but I'm not...

401
00:20:40.019 --> 00:20:42.429
It simply just is what happened.

402
00:20:45.519 --> 00:20:49.440
It isn't even really intended to be a story,

403
00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.719
it's just intended to let people understand what is

404
00:20:52.719 --> 00:20:55.739
happening in the world and that there are very positive

405
00:20:55.739 --> 00:20:57.399
things that are going on.

406
00:20:57.399 --> 00:20:59.179
<v Voiceover>Yes and you're really ushering it in.</v>

407
00:20:59.179 --> 00:21:02.129
You were ushering it in one step of the way year after year.

408
00:21:02.479 --> 00:21:07.479
<v ->Well, I don't think of it as me doing it it's--</v>

409
00:21:07.639 --> 00:21:08.979
<v Voiceover>The beings working with you.</v>

410
00:21:08.979 --> 00:21:11.979
<v ->It's mother earth and she selects certain people</v>

411
00:21:11.979 --> 00:21:14.659
to do certain things and that could change tomorrow.

412
00:21:14.659 --> 00:21:16.570
I understand that.

413
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.119
It's fine.

414
00:21:18.119 --> 00:21:20.239
<v Voiceover>Well bringing us then to today and that's</v>

415
00:21:20.239 --> 00:21:22.059
all I'm going to say about that because everybody

416
00:21:22.059 --> 00:21:24.439
can pick up a copy and see what has already been laid

417
00:21:24.439 --> 00:21:27.219
into place and then it becomes very clear by the end

418
00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:31.189
of this book, what we're preparing for.

419
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.739
But you've been given information by the indigenous

420
00:21:35.739 --> 00:21:39.200
elders and it has to do with what comes the next year

421
00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.739
to two years.

422
00:21:40.739 --> 00:21:43.179
It's not 2012 it's not even that far out.

423
00:21:43.179 --> 00:21:45.579
Can you begin sharing with us, because the viewers

424
00:21:45.579 --> 00:21:50.019
that are watching you right now, all of us are choosing

425
00:21:50.019 --> 00:21:51.979
to be part of the solution and choosing to

426
00:21:51.979 --> 00:21:53.539
prepare ourselves.

427
00:21:53.539 --> 00:21:55.369
<v ->Yeah that's good.</v>

428
00:21:55.579 --> 00:21:57.209
Sure of course.

429
00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.379
Okay that book was submitted to the publisher

430
00:22:02.379 --> 00:22:07.379
in June of 2007, in July of 2007, the head of the Mayan

431
00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:11.489
nation came here to Sedona and asked to have a meeting.

432
00:22:12.079 --> 00:22:15.269
Let me explain a little bit who he is.

433
00:22:17.898 --> 00:22:20.399
The Mayans live in three countries, Mexico, Belize

434
00:22:20.399 --> 00:22:22.048
and Guatemala.

435
00:22:22.139 --> 00:22:25.857
There are 440 tribes, each one of those tribes has

436
00:22:25.857 --> 00:22:30.857
an elected elder who represents them and those 440 elders

437
00:22:31.798 --> 00:22:35.368
make up a council, which is the Mayan Council.

438
00:22:35.758 --> 00:22:38.918
Then they elect one of them to be their president

439
00:22:38.918 --> 00:22:41.978
of their head of their council and that is the person

440
00:22:41.978 --> 00:22:46.978
of Don Alejandro Cirilo, and he is a 13th generation

441
00:22:49.179 --> 00:22:51.418
Mayan shaman and priest.

442
00:22:51.418 --> 00:22:56.418
It's been in his family for a very, very long time,

443
00:22:56.878 --> 00:23:01.478
and he represents Mayan thought and understading

444
00:23:01.478 --> 00:23:03.208
very well.

445
00:23:04.298 --> 00:23:08.118
I could see why they selected him, he's a clear person

446
00:23:08.118 --> 00:23:09.748
on those levels.

447
00:23:10.199 --> 00:23:13.539
And so he came here with his wife Elizabeth and they asked

448
00:23:13.539 --> 00:23:15.718
for a meeting so we had a meeting,

449
00:23:15.718 --> 00:23:18.708
and I had no idea what he wanted.

450
00:23:19.798 --> 00:23:24.798
He said that first of all, talking about everything that

451
00:23:24.818 --> 00:23:28.918
has been written about them from all over the world,

452
00:23:28.918 --> 00:23:32.298
all the things that we know the Mayan calendar included,

453
00:23:32.298 --> 00:23:36.618
and everything from Jose Arguelles and many universities

454
00:23:36.618 --> 00:23:39.598
and even governments have written stuff and all kinds

455
00:23:39.598 --> 00:23:41.568
of researches and people.

456
00:23:41.618 --> 00:23:44.218
But not one word has come from them,

457
00:23:44.218 --> 00:23:48.968
they haven't officially written one word in 526 years.

458
00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:53.278
So everything, even their history that the history books say

459
00:23:53.278 --> 00:23:55.168
they don't agree with it.

460
00:23:55.239 --> 00:23:57.078
They don't agree with hardly any of it.

461
00:23:57.078 --> 00:23:59.638
They say no, that's other people's ideas but that's not

462
00:23:59.638 --> 00:24:01.228
what we say.

463
00:24:02.318 --> 00:24:07.318
So he came here and said that their intention is,

464
00:24:08.318 --> 00:24:12.498
is to rewrite their history and their knowledge

465
00:24:12.498 --> 00:24:14.798
and everything that is known about them.

466
00:24:14.798 --> 00:24:18.338
But they said that in their calendar, it states that

467
00:24:18.338 --> 00:24:21.588
when they do this, the world will be watching.

468
00:24:26.039 --> 00:24:30.498
What they asked us to do, and I say us because it's not me

469
00:24:30.498 --> 00:24:35.498
but it's also another indigenous 501C3 that we work

470
00:24:36.058 --> 00:24:38.439
through which is called ICA,

471
00:24:38.439 --> 00:24:43.439
International Cultural Awareness, there's people there

472
00:24:45.098 --> 00:24:47.839
Adam Yellowbird and Carmen and then a lot of my people

473
00:24:47.839 --> 00:24:48.818
were there.

474
00:24:48.818 --> 00:24:50.748
We were are working together for this,

475
00:24:51.079 --> 00:24:55.239
and they wanted us to bring 60 people from every continent

476
00:24:55.239 --> 00:24:57.778
in the world, from all over the whole world that would

477
00:24:57.778 --> 00:25:00.139
do the ceremonies with them that would begin

478
00:25:00.139 --> 00:25:03.718
the whole thing, and then to sit in a room and watch

479
00:25:03.718 --> 00:25:08.718
them as they started redoing their history

480
00:25:09.138 --> 00:25:11.539
and their knowledge and that's what we did.

481
00:25:11.539 --> 00:25:13.249
We started with zero.

482
00:25:13.538 --> 00:25:14.398
<v Voiceover>Amazing.</v>

483
00:25:14.398 --> 00:25:16.899
<v ->The glyph for zero, that's all been written out.</v>

484
00:25:16.899 --> 00:25:18.958
But they were actually saying no this means that,

485
00:25:18.958 --> 00:25:20.648
this means this.

486
00:25:20.918 --> 00:25:25.718
And redefining what zero means from a Mayan point of view,

487
00:25:25.718 --> 00:25:28.178
and then they went to the number one, and we watched

488
00:25:28.178 --> 00:25:33.178
for many hours, about one say basically as they started

489
00:25:34.379 --> 00:25:35.378
the process.

490
00:25:35.378 --> 00:25:38.168
This process is gonna go one, to maybe even two years

491
00:25:38.339 --> 00:25:40.639
as they redo that,

492
00:25:40.639 --> 00:25:42.748
and then there's more to it.

493
00:25:43.058 --> 00:25:46.438
That's the mental side, the other side of it is

494
00:25:46.438 --> 00:25:50.198
the crystal skull ceremony that'll be coming up here

495
00:25:50.198 --> 00:25:51.948
in September.

496
00:25:52.039 --> 00:25:55.539
This is being headed I think by Hunbatz Men in Mexico

497
00:25:55.539 --> 00:26:00.539
and that ceremony it's incredible.

498
00:26:01.158 --> 00:26:04.118
We talked about it in there how the grandmothers

499
00:26:04.118 --> 00:26:08.639
create these crystals and the people going in them

500
00:26:08.639 --> 00:26:11.698
and they hold the knowledge and wisdom and the understanding

501
00:26:11.698 --> 00:26:13.728
of a certain period.

502
00:26:13.958 --> 00:26:15.939
Well there's 13 of them from the beginning all the way

503
00:26:15.939 --> 00:26:17.408
up until now.

504
00:26:17.578 --> 00:26:20.618
All 13 of those crystals which have been shown to me,

505
00:26:20.618 --> 00:26:22.768
they already have them.

506
00:26:22.779 --> 00:26:25.478
Or those crystal skulls are alive, they have living

507
00:26:25.478 --> 00:26:28.939
beings in them and when that ceremony is done

508
00:26:28.939 --> 00:26:32.998
then there will be elders that come and remember

509
00:26:32.998 --> 00:26:36.298
everything, everything will be transmitted to them.

510
00:26:36.298 --> 00:26:38.479
So they're gonna take all that ancient knowledge

511
00:26:38.479 --> 00:26:41.758
and overlay it with their intellectual knowledge

512
00:26:41.758 --> 00:26:45.398
of what they're doing to come up with who they are

513
00:26:45.398 --> 00:26:48.948
and what their purpose is at this time.

514
00:26:50.518 --> 00:26:53.548
And they know what's about to happen.

515
00:26:54.378 --> 00:26:59.079
So he asked us to do that and then also when they're

516
00:26:59.079 --> 00:27:01.778
done they're gonna write this into a book.

517
00:27:01.778 --> 00:27:06.038
I don't know what it's gonna be called but it's all

518
00:27:06.038 --> 00:27:10.188
around this time of 2012, December 21st 2012.

519
00:27:10.858 --> 00:27:15.858
They will write their knowledge and their message to

520
00:27:16.419 --> 00:27:19.918
the world about this period of time into a book,

521
00:27:19.918 --> 00:27:23.658
and then all 440 elders are gonna sign this so that

522
00:27:23.658 --> 00:27:26.258
the world knows that this is the real thing not just

523
00:27:26.258 --> 00:27:28.389
somebody making this up somewhere.

524
00:27:29.239 --> 00:27:32.048
It's gonna take a lot of pages just in that I guess.

525
00:27:35.439 --> 00:27:37.538
He wanted us to come right away, so it was in November

526
00:27:37.538 --> 00:27:41.179
when we left and went down there with these people

527
00:27:41.179 --> 00:27:45.139
and we find out then that the Mayans had tried this

528
00:27:45.139 --> 00:27:47.678
twice before with two other groups,

529
00:27:47.678 --> 00:27:50.458
and then right in the middle of it had to stop it

530
00:27:50.458 --> 00:27:52.439
and said no, this is not...

531
00:27:52.439 --> 00:27:54.368
You're not the people we thought.

532
00:27:55.118 --> 00:27:59.208
But it went beyond what they thought with our group.

533
00:27:59.958 --> 00:28:02.539
These people though they are from all kinds of races

534
00:28:02.539 --> 00:28:05.258
and Japanese and Black and White and green

535
00:28:05.258 --> 00:28:09.818
and everything else and from everywhere they were

536
00:28:09.818 --> 00:28:13.248
exactly who they thought they were.

537
00:28:13.318 --> 00:28:17.579
So we began with a ceremony that hadn't been performed

538
00:28:17.579 --> 00:28:22.579
really for 13,000 years in Lake Atitlan in Guatemala

539
00:28:23.458 --> 00:28:28.058
and then we went to Tikal and then we went inside

540
00:28:28.058 --> 00:28:30.368
the earth to a secret place.

541
00:28:31.738 --> 00:28:35.798
This is somewhere no one knows and I can't give you

542
00:28:35.798 --> 00:28:39.918
the name but it is the place where they were born from

543
00:28:39.918 --> 00:28:42.598
and I can't tell you everything right now 'cause

544
00:28:42.598 --> 00:28:45.279
I have to get permission before I go too much further.

545
00:28:45.279 --> 00:28:46.218
<v Voiceover>I understand.</v>

546
00:28:46.218 --> 00:28:48.579
<v ->But we did a ceremony in there and what we understand</v>

547
00:28:48.579 --> 00:28:52.039
now is they were waiting to see certain signs that would

548
00:28:52.039 --> 00:28:55.538
happen in that cave, and they all happened evidently

549
00:28:55.538 --> 00:28:58.179
'cause he then took us deeper into the cave to what

550
00:28:58.179 --> 00:29:01.698
the Hopi call the Sipapu, the place of emergence

551
00:29:01.698 --> 00:29:06.698
and I don't think white man is probably ever

552
00:29:08.977 --> 00:29:11.837
or industrialized man be better to say,

553
00:29:11.837 --> 00:29:14.797
has ever experienced what took place in there

554
00:29:14.797 --> 00:29:16.967
at that time, that was amazing.

555
00:29:18.177 --> 00:29:23.177
So now we are in an agreement with them to support

556
00:29:25.398 --> 00:29:30.327
them as all these writings come together and everything.

557
00:29:30.397 --> 00:29:31.837
We're trying to...

558
00:29:31.837 --> 00:29:34.857
The Mayans have no money and they have not even any

559
00:29:34.857 --> 00:29:36.427
buildings.

560
00:29:36.957 --> 00:29:40.417
When they get meetings together with their elders,

561
00:29:40.417 --> 00:29:42.737
they have to meet in like hotels and things.

562
00:29:42.737 --> 00:29:44.607
And it's expensive.

563
00:29:44.617 --> 00:29:45.777
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

564
00:29:45.777 --> 00:29:48.477
<v ->And so we're trying to get them a cultural center</v>

565
00:29:48.477 --> 00:29:51.897
where they can combine everything and do this

566
00:29:51.897 --> 00:29:55.467
and that's one of the things I'm working on now.

567
00:29:55.477 --> 00:29:57.317
I think I might have it, I don't know yet.

568
00:29:57.317 --> 00:29:58.537
<v Voiceover>Which country would that be in?</v>

569
00:29:58.537 --> 00:29:59.557
<v ->In Guatemala.</v>

570
00:29:59.557 --> 00:30:00.867
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

571
00:30:01.037 --> 00:30:04.417
<v ->And just to show you how things are changing so much,</v>

572
00:30:04.417 --> 00:30:08.977
since we had that and the new president of Guatemala

573
00:30:08.977 --> 00:30:10.468
came in.

574
00:30:12.537 --> 00:30:15.797
The new president of Guatemala was Don Alejandro's student,

575
00:30:15.797 --> 00:30:17.627
and he's part Mayan.

576
00:30:17.877 --> 00:30:20.737
And for the first time ever in Guatemala,

577
00:30:20.737 --> 00:30:25.177
Don Alejandro has a position in the government itself

578
00:30:25.177 --> 00:30:26.697
so that he can talk.

579
00:30:26.697 --> 00:30:28.858
He actually went on national television and for

580
00:30:28.858 --> 00:30:33.457
the first time ever, began to talk to the Guatemalan people,

581
00:30:33.457 --> 00:30:36.767
and this has never even been allowed before.

582
00:30:36.777 --> 00:30:38.717
<v Voiceover>All the resistance has fallen away.</v>

583
00:30:38.717 --> 00:30:39.677
<v ->Yeah completely--</v>

584
00:30:39.677 --> 00:30:40.957
<v Voiceover>Just what you were talking about earlier.</v>

585
00:30:40.957 --> 00:30:42.317
<v ->It is, everywhere.</v>

586
00:30:42.317 --> 00:30:43.477
<v Voiceover>Major indication.</v>

587
00:30:43.477 --> 00:30:45.227
<v ->Yeah it's really good.</v>

588
00:30:45.537 --> 00:30:48.337
So that is still going on now, they're in the midst

589
00:30:48.337 --> 00:30:51.277
of all of that and we're waiting for that.

590
00:30:51.277 --> 00:30:53.757
Now what he did say was,

591
00:30:53.757 --> 00:30:58.757
that this date of December 21st 2012 is almost

592
00:30:59.977 --> 00:31:03.327
for certain not the time when the change will take place.

593
00:31:03.377 --> 00:31:05.477
Even though everybody says on that day,

594
00:31:05.477 --> 00:31:08.347
the head of the Mayans say no we don't think so.

595
00:31:09.057 --> 00:31:12.217
It's a window of time and in June he said the windows

596
00:31:12.217 --> 00:31:15.237
about to open really soon and we're not exactly sure

597
00:31:15.237 --> 00:31:18.677
it depends on certain factors and it will close

598
00:31:18.677 --> 00:31:20.198
at a certain time.

599
00:31:20.198 --> 00:31:22.687
But it's about a seven year long window.

600
00:31:23.198 --> 00:31:27.957
One of the people that we invited through the ICA here

601
00:31:27.957 --> 00:31:30.817
to come along with us was one of the elders from

602
00:31:30.817 --> 00:31:32.517
the Hopi tribe.

603
00:31:32.517 --> 00:31:36.997
This is Grandfather Eric, and he is the last living memeber

604
00:31:36.997 --> 00:31:41.997
of the Blue Bird Clan and that clan was the historians

605
00:31:42.837 --> 00:31:44.637
of the Hopi tribe.

606
00:31:44.637 --> 00:31:47.637
They were the one's that write down and record everything

607
00:31:47.637 --> 00:31:49.477
that takes place in there.

608
00:31:49.477 --> 00:31:53.617
They put it into songs, all kinds of ways that they record

609
00:31:53.617 --> 00:31:55.247
their information.

610
00:31:56.657 --> 00:31:58.897
So I'm sitting on the bus with him and he's telling

611
00:31:58.897 --> 00:32:01.157
me the same thing that the Mayans are telling me.

612
00:32:01.157 --> 00:32:03.357
He says, almost everything you've heard about us

613
00:32:03.357 --> 00:32:05.847
is not from us, it's from other people.

614
00:32:05.877 --> 00:32:08.217
They say we came across Bering Strait and came down

615
00:32:08.217 --> 00:32:09.217
through there.

616
00:32:09.217 --> 00:32:12.277
That's what histories and archaeologists say.

617
00:32:12.277 --> 00:32:14.277
But he says, we know that's not true.

618
00:32:14.277 --> 00:32:16.917
Where we came from was Guatemala and we used

619
00:32:16.917 --> 00:32:19.967
to be Mayan and the Mayans knew that.

620
00:32:20.257 --> 00:32:23.157
But there was a time a long time ago where the decision

621
00:32:23.157 --> 00:32:25.457
was made that a group of the Mayans would head north

622
00:32:25.457 --> 00:32:29.307
and would then find a new place.

623
00:32:30.057 --> 00:32:32.267
That's the Hopi.

624
00:32:33.017 --> 00:32:35.957
Grandfather Martin who is the one who now holds

625
00:32:35.957 --> 00:32:39.877
the Hopi Prophecy and Grandfather Don Alejandro

626
00:32:39.877 --> 00:32:43.537
have exchanged their prophecies and they claim

627
00:32:43.537 --> 00:32:45.347
they're identical.

628
00:32:45.357 --> 00:32:46.637
There's no difference at all.

629
00:32:46.637 --> 00:32:48.517
They are the same prophecy.

630
00:32:52.787 --> 00:32:57.177
What happened in all of that which was pretty interesting

631
00:32:57.177 --> 00:33:00.957
was if you remember, I think it was October 26th,

632
00:33:00.957 --> 00:33:03.378
when the comet came through,

633
00:33:03.378 --> 00:33:06.695
Comet Holmes, was it holmes, I think.

634
00:33:06.695 --> 00:33:07.935
<v Voiceover>Don't remember the name.</v>

635
00:33:07.935 --> 00:33:08.915
<v ->Holmes, Homer...</v>

636
00:33:08.915 --> 00:33:10.195
Holmes I think it was.

637
00:33:10.195 --> 00:33:14.095
And on that day I believe it was October 26th of 2007

638
00:33:14.095 --> 00:33:19.095
it blew up and formed this huge blue sphere of light

639
00:33:19.095 --> 00:33:22.435
in the sky that very rapidly became the biggest thing

640
00:33:22.435 --> 00:33:23.895
in the solar system.

641
00:33:23.895 --> 00:33:26.636
It was actually larger than the sun.

642
00:33:26.636 --> 00:33:31.595
And he's saying on the bus, Grandfather Eric and he's asking

643
00:33:31.595 --> 00:33:34.495
me, you think that's the Hopi Prophecy.

644
00:33:34.495 --> 00:33:37.395
Because you see the Hopi, 200 years ago

645
00:33:37.395 --> 00:33:41.615
gave a prophecy about this time that a blue star would

646
00:33:41.615 --> 00:33:45.576
appear in the sky and it would become the beginning

647
00:33:45.576 --> 00:33:48.525
of this window that the Mayans talk about.

648
00:33:49.956 --> 00:33:52.655
So when he got back the council met and they all met

649
00:33:52.655 --> 00:33:56.016
and they've now agreed that this is the Hopi Prophecy,

650
00:33:56.016 --> 00:33:57.535
the blue star.

651
00:33:57.535 --> 00:34:00.055
And the Mayans have now linked back and say okay,

652
00:34:00.055 --> 00:34:05.055
so October 24th, 26th, it could be the 4th or the 6th

653
00:34:05.456 --> 00:34:07.136
but I think it's the 26th.

654
00:34:07.136 --> 00:34:09.755
From that day is the beginning of the window which

655
00:34:09.755 --> 00:34:13.095
the Mayans call the end of time and it goes for

656
00:34:13.095 --> 00:34:15.985
till about 2015 or so.

657
00:34:17.115 --> 00:34:21.835
So what the Mayans are saying is that inside this window

658
00:34:21.835 --> 00:34:26.575
which we are now inside of, will come these changes

659
00:34:26.575 --> 00:34:31.575
that they are about to prophesize and I know what part

660
00:34:31.695 --> 00:34:32.755
of that is.

661
00:34:32.755 --> 00:34:34.795
They are going to prophesize that there will be

662
00:34:34.795 --> 00:34:35.835
a pole shift.

663
00:34:35.835 --> 00:34:38.315
A physical pole shift, not just a magnetic pole shift,

664
00:34:38.315 --> 00:34:40.025
but a physical pole shift.

665
00:34:40.835 --> 00:34:45.345
And that's a pretty interesting thing.

666
00:34:45.995 --> 00:34:47.995
The whole sequence that's happening around this

667
00:34:47.995 --> 00:34:50.245
in the world right now is interesting.

668
00:34:50.535 --> 00:34:53.935
Whenever there's a pole shift, there's always a magnetic

669
00:34:53.935 --> 00:34:56.585
pole shift that happens right prior to it.

670
00:34:56.875 --> 00:35:00.985
This has been recorded going back a long time.

671
00:35:01.055 --> 00:35:03.655
They've actually only proven this that I'm aware of,

672
00:35:03.655 --> 00:35:05.685
for the last two times.

673
00:35:05.835 --> 00:35:09.195
But it is a common belief,

674
00:35:09.195 --> 00:35:12.695
and the scientists of the world have been watching

675
00:35:12.695 --> 00:35:17.571
how for 2,000 years the magnetic field

676
00:35:17.571 --> 00:35:19.871
of the earth has been dropping, then 500 years ago

677
00:35:19.871 --> 00:35:23.011
it started dropping more and then about 40 years ago,

678
00:35:23.011 --> 00:35:27.411
the anomalies became great, so great that things were

679
00:35:27.411 --> 00:35:29.311
moving all over the place.

680
00:35:29.311 --> 00:35:31.671
About 15 years ago they had to change the maps of

681
00:35:31.671 --> 00:35:35.111
the airports because they were so inconsistent,

682
00:35:35.111 --> 00:35:37.331
and now every time they land an airplane they have

683
00:35:37.331 --> 00:35:39.871
to check immediately before to see if north is really north.

684
00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:40.811
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

685
00:35:40.811 --> 00:35:42.051
<v ->Otherwise they'll land out in the field.</v>

686
00:35:42.051 --> 00:35:42.971
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

687
00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:49.532
<v ->But about a year and a half ago you had the world</v>

688
00:35:49.532 --> 00:35:53.172
scientists for 11 days say that the anomalies were

689
00:35:53.172 --> 00:35:55.972
so great that they expect the poles to shift

690
00:35:55.972 --> 00:35:59.212
north to south and that doesn't happen too often.

691
00:35:59.212 --> 00:36:01.672
That's something that happens...

692
00:36:01.672 --> 00:36:03.812
I don't really know the statistics but lets say at least

693
00:36:03.812 --> 00:36:06.902
every 50 million years or so,

694
00:36:07.332 --> 00:36:09.292
and that's pretty rare.

695
00:36:09.292 --> 00:36:11.142
North to south, south to north.

696
00:36:11.352 --> 00:36:14.212
And the said best we can tell sometime between now

697
00:36:14.212 --> 00:36:15.962
and the next 25 years,

698
00:36:15.992 --> 00:36:17.732
and then they were cut off by the governments of

699
00:36:17.732 --> 00:36:19.132
the world, they couldn't talk.

700
00:36:19.132 --> 00:36:22.072
Then about six months ago they got out for five days

701
00:36:22.072 --> 00:36:24.132
before they come them off and they said,

702
00:36:24.132 --> 00:36:26.152
it's way worse than we ever thought,

703
00:36:26.152 --> 00:36:27.882
it's gonna happen any minute.

704
00:36:28.132 --> 00:36:29.732
And that's about all they could get out before

705
00:36:29.732 --> 00:36:31.732
the government shut them down and wouldn't

706
00:36:31.732 --> 00:36:33.462
let them talk anymore.

707
00:36:34.272 --> 00:36:35.772
<v Voiceover>Lets talk about the link then.</v>

708
00:36:35.772 --> 00:36:37.662
What happens after the magnetic shift?

709
00:36:38.112 --> 00:36:41.072
<v ->Well when the magnetic poles shift,</v>

710
00:36:41.072 --> 00:36:46.072
scientifically that means that almost for sure you're gonna

711
00:36:46.852 --> 00:36:50.731
have a physical pole shift directly after that very soon,

712
00:36:50.731 --> 00:36:55.731
and that is what the Mayans and the Hopi are predicting.

713
00:36:58.192 --> 00:37:00.151
I can't say the Hopi yet because they haven't physically

714
00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:03.042
announced it, but the Mayans have physically announced it.

715
00:37:03.811 --> 00:37:06.051
They came here and they announced it here to this city

716
00:37:06.051 --> 00:37:08.301
that this is what was gonna happen.

717
00:37:10.191 --> 00:37:13.791
We can go back 13,000 years go that the other end

718
00:37:13.791 --> 00:37:15.751
of the precession of the equinoxes that I speak

719
00:37:15.751 --> 00:37:17.151
about it there.

720
00:37:17.151 --> 00:37:19.951
There was a pole shift and a magnetic pole shift.

721
00:37:19.951 --> 00:37:22.911
The magnetic poles went all the way to Hawaii

722
00:37:22.911 --> 00:37:25.091
and then moved around and eventually came back

723
00:37:25.091 --> 00:37:28.692
to where they are now and the physical pole they believe,

724
00:37:28.692 --> 00:37:31.871
was in Hudson Bay and moved from where it is up to

725
00:37:31.871 --> 00:37:36.371
where it is there; and that's the best they can determine

726
00:37:36.371 --> 00:37:38.222
at this moment.

727
00:37:38.632 --> 00:37:43.632
Then if you back 26,000 years,

728
00:37:44.052 --> 00:37:46.851
which is exactly where we are right now,

729
00:37:46.851 --> 00:37:50.811
or we will be precisely on December 21st 2012;

730
00:37:50.811 --> 00:37:53.141
that'll be the other end of that cycle.

731
00:37:53.951 --> 00:37:55.911
There was another pole shift and another magnetic

732
00:37:55.911 --> 00:37:57.251
pole shift.

733
00:37:57.251 --> 00:38:02.251
And so we know that there's been two in a row here.

734
00:38:02.911 --> 00:38:06.731
Now from the study, which we have looked at that data

735
00:38:06.731 --> 00:38:11.421
of pole shifts, we've gone back 250 million years.

736
00:38:12.032 --> 00:38:13.791
When you go back through that and look it,

737
00:38:13.791 --> 00:38:17.571
you'll see that the poles will shift and when they do

738
00:38:17.571 --> 00:38:20.732
there's usually about 15 of them in a row,

739
00:38:20.732 --> 00:38:24.391
and then it doesn't shift for maybe millions of years,

740
00:38:24.391 --> 00:38:26.281
and then it'll do it again.

741
00:38:26.632 --> 00:38:30.371
Based on that science would predict that there would be one

742
00:38:30.371 --> 00:38:31.981
right now.

743
00:38:32.371 --> 00:38:34.171
If it did one, two and three it's probably gonna keep

744
00:38:34.171 --> 00:38:35.721
going for a while.

745
00:38:36.132 --> 00:38:40.231
And that is exactly what the world scientists have

746
00:38:40.231 --> 00:38:42.371
just predicted on the History Channel.

747
00:38:42.371 --> 00:38:45.491
They just predicted that we think, they said this

748
00:38:45.491 --> 00:38:47.491
just about a month ago.

749
00:38:47.491 --> 00:38:51.111
That the earth is probably going to go through a pole shift,

750
00:38:51.111 --> 00:38:53.401
a physical pole shift very, very soon.

751
00:38:53.551 --> 00:38:56.392
<v Voiceover>Lets talk about since the indigenous elders</v>

752
00:38:56.392 --> 00:38:59.421
have talked about this process, what is the process?

753
00:38:59.451 --> 00:39:01.192
What does this mean?

754
00:39:01.192 --> 00:39:03.391
<v ->Well what we know also scientifically by the study</v>

755
00:39:03.391 --> 00:39:07.691
of this, what the world knows is that when it does happen

756
00:39:07.691 --> 00:39:10.981
it's like the crack of a whip, it's less than one day.

757
00:39:11.671 --> 00:39:13.831
You wake up one morning and everything's normal

758
00:39:13.831 --> 00:39:18.591
and by the time the next morning the entire geography

759
00:39:18.591 --> 00:39:20.641
of the entire world has been changed.

760
00:39:21.111 --> 00:39:24.261
So the length of time is about 20 hours.

761
00:39:25.351 --> 00:39:27.901
It's a very fast thing.

762
00:39:30.311 --> 00:39:33.311
The last two times there were no civilization

763
00:39:33.311 --> 00:39:36.251
like building and structures all over the world.

764
00:39:36.251 --> 00:39:39.591
But really I think most scientists would agree with me

765
00:39:39.591 --> 00:39:43.451
that if there was a pole shift, that probably hardly

766
00:39:43.451 --> 00:39:45.982
any buildings on the planet would be left standing.

767
00:39:46.531 --> 00:39:49.232
I doubt it, I can't imagine how they would.

768
00:39:49.232 --> 00:39:51.831
Maybe the great pyramid might and things like this,

769
00:39:51.831 --> 00:39:56.091
but not these kind of buildings made out of sticks

770
00:39:56.091 --> 00:39:57.582
and stones.

771
00:39:57.631 --> 00:40:00.591
These big high towers, no they're just gonna fall over.

772
00:40:00.591 --> 00:40:03.391
I mean forget about one to ten on your earthquake

773
00:40:03.391 --> 00:40:07.282
rector scale, this would be like a 20 or something.

774
00:40:09.132 --> 00:40:11.132
This is when whole mountains go up and down

775
00:40:11.132 --> 00:40:14.801
and continents break off in pieces and everything else.

776
00:40:15.491 --> 00:40:17.842
It really does change everything.

777
00:40:18.811 --> 00:40:23.191
This was even predicted by Edgar Cayce if you remember

778
00:40:23.191 --> 00:40:26.661
way back in the 30's he predicted this would happen.

779
00:40:27.051 --> 00:40:28.111
<v Voiceover>Yes,</v>

780
00:40:28.111 --> 00:40:30.351
and we're seeing all this anomalous earthquake activity

781
00:40:30.351 --> 00:40:31.742
right now.

782
00:40:32.151 --> 00:40:35.411
<v ->The earthquake activity as of about seven or eight</v>

783
00:40:35.411 --> 00:40:38.062
years ago was over 500% over normal.

784
00:40:38.891 --> 00:40:40.251
From what is normally is.

785
00:40:40.251 --> 00:40:42.091
Not just earthquake but everything, all the various

786
00:40:42.091 --> 00:40:43.801
natural phenomenon.

787
00:40:44.151 --> 00:40:46.991
That data came of Russia 'cause they were recording,

788
00:40:46.991 --> 00:40:49.141
measuring this very carefully.

789
00:40:49.971 --> 00:40:51.571
<v Voiceover>I wonder what they would say now,</v>

790
00:40:51.571 --> 00:40:52.651
'cause it's getting worse.

791
00:40:52.651 --> 00:40:54.491
<v ->It's gone up it's not going down, it's going up</v>

792
00:40:54.491 --> 00:40:55.951
higher and higher and higher.

793
00:40:55.951 --> 00:41:00.011
But this is what the Mayans said to me that they want

794
00:41:00.011 --> 00:41:01.461
to say to you.

795
00:41:01.491 --> 00:41:05.251
Yes, we're gonna go through this but they were there

796
00:41:05.251 --> 00:41:08.811
in Atlantis 13,000 years ago when this happened

797
00:41:08.811 --> 00:41:11.251
and they remember what happened,

798
00:41:11.251 --> 00:41:14.491
and they were also there 26,000 years ago

799
00:41:14.491 --> 00:41:15.691
when we went through it.

800
00:41:15.691 --> 00:41:17.211
So they've been through two of these,

801
00:41:17.211 --> 00:41:20.031
and they know what we're about to go through.

802
00:41:20.031 --> 00:41:23.541
So what they're trying to do it's really,

803
00:41:24.931 --> 00:41:27.971
it's compassion for the world because they know

804
00:41:27.971 --> 00:41:30.051
what we're about to go through,

805
00:41:30.051 --> 00:41:32.091
and it isn't so much that they wanna predict it's

806
00:41:32.091 --> 00:41:33.651
gonna happen.

807
00:41:33.651 --> 00:41:37.311
It's they want to give us their wisdom as what to do

808
00:41:37.311 --> 00:41:38.961
when it happens.

809
00:41:39.991 --> 00:41:43.291
Because they said in the last time millions and millions

810
00:41:43.291 --> 00:41:45.891
and millions of people died all over the world.

811
00:41:45.891 --> 00:41:48.979
Just because they didn't know a few simple things.

812
00:41:49.429 --> 00:41:51.289
<v Voiceover>Can you share those simple things?</v>

813
00:41:51.289 --> 00:41:52.939
<v ->No I can't.</v>

814
00:41:53.789 --> 00:41:56.029
I know a little bit about it but I don't know enough

815
00:41:56.029 --> 00:41:58.060
and they're gonna put it into their book.

816
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:59.389
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

817
00:41:59.389 --> 00:42:01.219
<v ->But what it is,</v>

818
00:42:01.929 --> 00:42:04.769
is there's certain things that we need to change

819
00:42:04.769 --> 00:42:08.159
within ourselves at which point if we do that,

820
00:42:08.689 --> 00:42:13.689
we can, not only won't die, we will go up in awareness

821
00:42:14.509 --> 00:42:16.479
and consciousness.

822
00:42:17.269 --> 00:42:20.610
So they're doing it for themselves, there's no doubt.

823
00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:23.569
They're doing it for their own people so that they're

824
00:42:23.569 --> 00:42:25.830
prepared but they're also doing it for the world

825
00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:29.949
so the world, well at least those who want to listen.

826
00:42:29.949 --> 00:42:32.609
You can't force anybody to listen but for those that wanna

827
00:42:32.609 --> 00:42:35.769
listen there's some changes you can make inside yourself

828
00:42:35.769 --> 00:42:39.629
that will completely change the outcome of what happens

829
00:42:39.629 --> 00:42:41.219
during those times.

830
00:42:41.509 --> 00:42:44.709
<v Voiceover>And we should be starting to access some</v>

831
00:42:44.709 --> 00:42:46.679
of this information intuitively.

832
00:42:47.009 --> 00:42:49.559
<v ->We are, as a planet we are.</v>

833
00:42:50.169 --> 00:42:52.369
I think they just wanna really define it clearly.

834
00:42:52.369 --> 00:42:55.569
A few people are in the world with six and a half billion

835
00:42:55.569 --> 00:43:00.369
you're talking about maybe less than 100 million

836
00:43:00.369 --> 00:43:04.009
are actually interested enough to make these kind

837
00:43:04.009 --> 00:43:05.109
of changes.

838
00:43:05.109 --> 00:43:06.710
<v Voiceover>I understand.</v>

839
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:09.269
In fact one of the things I find a little concerning

840
00:43:09.269 --> 00:43:13.029
is not surprisingly, during this period of time

841
00:43:13.029 --> 00:43:16.089
there's a plethora of production that's taking place

842
00:43:16.089 --> 00:43:17.189
right now.

843
00:43:17.189 --> 00:43:22.189
A lot of it really trying to squeeze the emotional bodies

844
00:43:22.709 --> 00:43:26.929
via disinformation and shock films about 2012

845
00:43:26.929 --> 00:43:28.969
and so on and so forth.

846
00:43:28.969 --> 00:43:30.909
<v ->Yeah there's about 30 books being written too</v>

847
00:43:30.909 --> 00:43:32.079
about this.

848
00:43:35.029 --> 00:43:37.569
<v Voiceover>What is your perception of that?</v>

849
00:43:37.569 --> 00:43:40.869
Because it seems to me it's just either it's someone

850
00:43:40.869 --> 00:43:43.829
simply exploiting the subject or even more so,

851
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:48.829
it is an effort to start creating a fear scenario which

852
00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:53.039
changes they way we are able to respond.

853
00:43:53.809 --> 00:43:55.989
<v ->The Mayans definitely are not interested in creating</v>

854
00:43:55.989 --> 00:43:58.799
the fear, they want us to overcome our fear

855
00:43:59.149 --> 00:44:02.150
and become calm and balanced during these times

856
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:04.200
of what's about to happen.

857
00:44:07.969 --> 00:44:10.209
It's true there are you know...

858
00:44:10.209 --> 00:44:12.359
It's just human nature.

859
00:44:12.649 --> 00:44:16.249
You put a date into the future like that and have certain

860
00:44:16.249 --> 00:44:18.608
predictions that weren't even made really by the Mayans

861
00:44:18.608 --> 00:44:23.608
but by other people and there's gonna be people

862
00:44:23.949 --> 00:44:26.638
building up to this.

863
00:44:27.348 --> 00:44:30.187
Most of these people probably won't have any idea what

864
00:44:30.187 --> 00:44:33.187
they're really talking about, but there will be some

865
00:44:33.187 --> 00:44:34.927
that do.

866
00:44:34.927 --> 00:44:37.947
<v Voiceover>But it almost all focuses on the horror</v>

867
00:44:37.947 --> 00:44:39.887
except for a few conscious productions.

868
00:44:39.887 --> 00:44:41.287
<v ->A lot of them.</v>

869
00:44:41.287 --> 00:44:44.867
But there are gonna be some, one of them that I think

870
00:44:44.867 --> 00:44:47.528
is gonna be pretty interesting is Colin Andrew's

871
00:44:47.528 --> 00:44:50.967
and what he comes up with because of the crop circle,

872
00:44:50.967 --> 00:44:53.667
the Mayan crop circles that appeared and the calendars

873
00:44:53.667 --> 00:44:55.147
and what happened and all of that.

874
00:44:55.147 --> 00:44:56.537
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

875
00:44:56.547 --> 00:44:58.147
Could you talk about that a bit?

876
00:44:58.147 --> 00:45:02.687
<v ->Well I was deeply into crop circles for many, many years</v>

877
00:45:02.687 --> 00:45:05.287
and I haven't been following it a whole lot now.

878
00:45:05.287 --> 00:45:08.607
I actually trust him because he's a totally honest person

879
00:45:08.607 --> 00:45:10.387
and he's a great reporter.

880
00:45:10.387 --> 00:45:11.628
<v Voiceover>Yeah I like him.</v>

881
00:45:11.628 --> 00:45:13.587
<v ->He's just a reporter, he's just telling it like it is.</v>

882
00:45:15.437 --> 00:45:17.787
I know that him and his wife are in the midst

883
00:45:17.787 --> 00:45:19.817
of writing a book around 2012.

884
00:45:20.427 --> 00:45:22.727
You know that's a book I would read.

885
00:45:22.727 --> 00:45:25.927
But a lot of them I know it's gonna be exploitation

886
00:45:25.927 --> 00:45:28.387
of just writing on the fear.

887
00:45:31.337 --> 00:45:32.938
There's nothing we can do.

888
00:45:32.987 --> 00:45:36.277
You just have to have a discrimination and you know.

889
00:45:36.487 --> 00:45:38.728
Obviously if the Mayans come out they're all talking

890
00:45:38.728 --> 00:45:41.147
about the Mayan date if the Mayans have their own book,

891
00:45:41.147 --> 00:45:43.627
it's gonna kind of take over.

892
00:45:43.627 --> 00:45:45.587
(chuckles) Over anybody else's.

893
00:45:47.927 --> 00:45:50.517
<v Voiceover>If any sound of it prevails.</v>

894
00:45:50.527 --> 00:45:53.617
<v ->Yeah you'd read from the people that talked about this.</v>

895
00:45:54.267 --> 00:45:59.267
But I think that it's just in human nature.

896
00:45:59.687 --> 00:46:01.877
It's just where we are right now.

897
00:46:01.947 --> 00:46:03.187
<v Voiceover>You told me something off camera</v>

898
00:46:03.187 --> 00:46:05.087
and I don't know if you care to talk about it,

899
00:46:05.087 --> 00:46:06.927
we can snip it out of you don't.

900
00:46:06.927 --> 00:46:09.227
But you mentioned to me on the phone about a week ago

901
00:46:09.227 --> 00:46:11.388
we were chatting before this interview.

902
00:46:11.388 --> 00:46:16.388
That you had been told simply that if we understood

903
00:46:17.067 --> 00:46:21.427
what awaits us, after the transition through,

904
00:46:21.427 --> 00:46:25.638
that people would be jumping up and down with joy.

905
00:46:25.867 --> 00:46:29.857
<v ->This is truly a time of great celebration.</v>

906
00:46:30.388 --> 00:46:32.847
Because we're been through the dark part of the cycle,

907
00:46:32.847 --> 00:46:35.347
and now we're heading in the light part of the cycle.

908
00:46:35.347 --> 00:46:40.347
As much as it will be a death of the old part of the cycle,

909
00:46:40.927 --> 00:46:44.627
it is also simultaneously a birth of something that is just

910
00:46:44.627 --> 00:46:46.567
super beautiful.

911
00:46:48.967 --> 00:46:51.487
This is also what the Mayans wanna talk about,

912
00:46:51.487 --> 00:46:53.967
I believe, at least they talk about it with me so I think

913
00:46:53.967 --> 00:46:55.328
they'd wanna talk about it.

914
00:46:55.328 --> 00:47:00.328
But this new era is a time, what they talk about

915
00:47:00.927 --> 00:47:03.177
is our quarantine has lifted.

916
00:47:03.267 --> 00:47:06.287
We have been locked on this little planet and we can't

917
00:47:06.287 --> 00:47:10.287
move and we believe there's life out there and it looks

918
00:47:10.287 --> 00:47:13.088
like life is all around us with all these UFO's

919
00:47:13.088 --> 00:47:14.287
and everything.

920
00:47:14.287 --> 00:47:16.928
But, we haven't made...

921
00:47:16.928 --> 00:47:19.527
There's been very little direct connection.

922
00:47:19.527 --> 00:47:22.267
There has been some but it's been very, very small.

923
00:47:22.267 --> 00:47:26.527
But what they are saying is that when we pass through

924
00:47:26.527 --> 00:47:30.287
this other level we become more than human,

925
00:47:30.287 --> 00:47:33.087
far more than where we are now.

926
00:47:33.087 --> 00:47:36.087
Our consciousness rises to another level of existence,

927
00:47:36.087 --> 00:47:39.047
of which point we are no longer quarantined here.

928
00:47:39.047 --> 00:47:42.547
We are able to move around the universe and begin

929
00:47:42.547 --> 00:47:47.047
to understand the bigger family that we live in,

930
00:47:47.047 --> 00:47:49.237
and live within.

931
00:47:50.147 --> 00:47:54.467
So I imagine anyway that they will talk about this

932
00:47:54.467 --> 00:47:56.277
and discuss this.

933
00:47:56.647 --> 00:47:59.787
And even more though, I can only hint at it,

934
00:47:59.787 --> 00:48:03.187
and that's all I can do because I have certain promises

935
00:48:03.187 --> 00:48:06.177
that have been made to me that I can't really talk about it.

936
00:48:06.987 --> 00:48:10.028
The Mayans and many, many tribes in South

937
00:48:10.028 --> 00:48:13.747
and Central America and some in North America,

938
00:48:13.747 --> 00:48:18.747
have decided to have a ceremony here in Arizona

939
00:48:20.287 --> 00:48:23.187
in April of 2009 which is called the return of

940
00:48:23.187 --> 00:48:25.157
the ancestors.

941
00:48:25.247 --> 00:48:29.128
It's a ceremony that'll be done by over 100 tribes,

942
00:48:29.128 --> 00:48:34.128
and as soon as that ceremony is done, then it is possible

943
00:48:35.587 --> 00:48:39.687
for our ancestors to truly return,

944
00:48:39.687 --> 00:48:42.737
and they expect it to happen.

945
00:48:44.547 --> 00:48:47.287
Who they're talking about is the very people that

946
00:48:47.287 --> 00:48:51.107
are discussed in Samarian records of the Nephilim

947
00:48:51.107 --> 00:48:55.957
from Marduk and from the Syrians from the Star Syria's.

948
00:48:56.527 --> 00:48:59.287
These are our mother and our father and according

949
00:48:59.287 --> 00:49:01.787
to the indigenous people they are here and lots of them,

950
00:49:01.787 --> 00:49:04.537
and they're in mountains right now.

951
00:49:05.367 --> 00:49:09.487
The time in that same year they're predicting that

952
00:49:09.487 --> 00:49:12.767
we will hold their hands and look into their eyes

953
00:49:12.767 --> 00:49:14.937
and the transformation will begin.

954
00:49:16.027 --> 00:49:17.807
I can't say much more than that,

955
00:49:17.807 --> 00:49:19.147
and if it happens it happens.

956
00:49:19.147 --> 00:49:20.557
I don't know.

957
00:49:22.027 --> 00:49:25.797
They believe totally, it's gonna happen.

958
00:49:26.308 --> 00:49:28.067
But I don't know how it's gonna happen,

959
00:49:28.067 --> 00:49:31.027
I don't know if this is something that is a secret event

960
00:49:31.027 --> 00:49:33.477
or if it is a public event.

961
00:49:34.027 --> 00:49:37.167
I don't know that and I can't say,

962
00:49:37.167 --> 00:49:38.687
at this point.

963
00:49:38.687 --> 00:49:40.967
<v Voiceover>Any final thoughts in in terms of</v>

964
00:49:40.967 --> 00:49:43.427
your own wisdom, from everything you've learned

965
00:49:43.427 --> 00:49:46.287
throughout your experience here, beyond what

966
00:49:46.287 --> 00:49:48.837
the Maya have to say about this period.

967
00:49:49.227 --> 00:49:52.747
<v ->Well I don't know if I have any wisdom about this period</v>

968
00:49:52.747 --> 00:49:57.747
in the sense of, I wasn't here and they have experience

969
00:49:57.907 --> 00:49:59.317
in all of this.

970
00:50:00.167 --> 00:50:04.427
I have no memory of ever writing out a pole shift before.

971
00:50:04.427 --> 00:50:06.167
<v Voiceover>Right. (chuckles)</v>

972
00:50:06.167 --> 00:50:10.587
<v ->But in my training with the Kogi and the Arhuacos</v>

973
00:50:10.587 --> 00:50:14.487
and the Sierra Nevada people and the Aboriginals

974
00:50:14.487 --> 00:50:18.987
in Australia and especially the Waitaha and the Maori

975
00:50:18.987 --> 00:50:21.187
in New Zealand and other places.

976
00:50:21.187 --> 00:50:26.187
What they talk about is that this is a return...

977
00:50:28.227 --> 00:50:30.457
How do I put this.

978
00:50:31.908 --> 00:50:36.287
During Atlantis 13,000 years ago and even in the Bible,

979
00:50:36.287 --> 00:50:39.147
they talk about this fall that took place, that we dropped

980
00:50:39.147 --> 00:50:43.007
in consciousness and all that was even though

981
00:50:43.007 --> 00:50:45.247
there's books written about it and all kinds of levels

982
00:50:45.247 --> 00:50:47.447
and all kinds of ways and everything else.

983
00:50:47.447 --> 00:50:49.808
From purely indigenous people we just move

984
00:50:49.808 --> 00:50:51.908
from our hear to our head.

985
00:50:51.908 --> 00:50:52.847
Period.

986
00:50:52.847 --> 00:50:54.547
It's that simple.

987
00:50:54.547 --> 00:50:57.087
And now we're completely in our head and we've forgotten

988
00:50:57.087 --> 00:50:58.607
our heart.

989
00:51:00.287 --> 00:51:04.327
What happens in this shift is that we move back

990
00:51:04.327 --> 00:51:06.827
from our head back to our heart,

991
00:51:06.827 --> 00:51:10.227
and the only people that survive this according to these

992
00:51:10.227 --> 00:51:13.367
people are the people that are in their hearts.

993
00:51:15.207 --> 00:51:18.537
More than that all of them will survive.

994
00:51:18.587 --> 00:51:20.567
Everyone in their heart will survive.

995
00:51:20.567 --> 00:51:22.628
They say that mother earth knows the vibration

996
00:51:22.628 --> 00:51:27.628
and though we think when chaos is going on

997
00:51:27.727 --> 00:51:30.587
that it's just like a bunch of random events,

998
00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:33.108
but from their point of view there's no random events

999
00:51:33.108 --> 00:51:34.407
anywhere.

1000
00:51:34.407 --> 00:51:36.487
Everything is pure consciousness.

1001
00:51:38.388 --> 00:51:40.547
A rock cannot fall on a person,

1002
00:51:40.547 --> 00:51:43.967
by just a random event or something like that.

1003
00:51:43.967 --> 00:51:48.217
It is literally being controlled by earth's consciousness.

1004
00:51:49.267 --> 00:51:52.927
What they say is that if you are in your heart,

1005
00:51:52.927 --> 00:51:55.738
that is all that is necessary.

1006
00:51:56.107 --> 00:51:58.227
You don't need food and water and guns and hole

1007
00:51:58.227 --> 00:52:00.777
or any kind of protection or anything.

1008
00:52:00.807 --> 00:52:04.488
You can just stand naked in a field and you will be

1009
00:52:04.488 --> 00:52:06.588
absolutely fine, there will be no problems

1010
00:52:06.588 --> 00:52:08.867
and they believed this all over the world,

1011
00:52:08.867 --> 00:52:10.937
and I agree with them.

1012
00:52:13.288 --> 00:52:15.088
<v ->You can purchase a copy of "Serpent of Light"</v>

1013
00:52:15.088 --> 00:52:17.767
from any good bookstore and also from our website.

1014
00:52:17.767 --> 00:52:20.208
Also Drunvalo's website contains a large amount

1015
00:52:20.208 --> 00:52:23.187
of information regarding the current times and upcoming

1016
00:52:23.187 --> 00:52:24.708
events of the elders.

1017
00:52:24.708 --> 00:52:28.147
You can find all of that at Spiritofmaat.com

1018
00:52:28.147 --> 00:52:31.397
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
