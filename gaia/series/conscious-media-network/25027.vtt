00:00:01.883 --> 00:00:06.883
(peaceful music)

2
00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:14.808
<v ->It's been said that numbers and geometry</v>

3
00:00:14.808 --> 00:00:17.240
are among the fundamental building blocks of life.

4
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.397
More fundamental yet, are energy and intention.

5
00:00:20.397 --> 00:00:22.829
Lloyd Mear was ahead of his time in coming to

6
00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.240
the understanding that each and every ailment,

7
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.888
nutrient, emotion, and so forth, has its own frequency,

8
00:00:28.888 --> 00:00:31.042
signified by a sequence of numbers.

9
00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:33.752
After years of research, he found that by reciting

10
00:00:33.752 --> 00:00:37.186
the correlative number, for balancing a particular ailment,

11
00:00:37.186 --> 00:00:39.769
that the body would respond the same as with

12
00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:41.389
the physical antidote.

13
00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:44.967
It's loosely speaking, a matter of healing by the numbers.

14
00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:55.847
Lloyd this is really a very interesting

15
00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:59.088
an esoteric topic, because you're reducing

16
00:00:59.088 --> 00:01:02.528
the healing frequencies to numbers.

17
00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.840
And yet if you look at the world of physics, even quantum

18
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.828
physics, it seems that everything comes down

19
00:01:08.828 --> 00:01:11.813
to numbers and geometry.

20
00:01:11.813 --> 00:01:13.968
In terms of the building blocks of life.

21
00:01:13.968 --> 00:01:17.019
So as you start explaining this, let's get

22
00:01:17.019 --> 00:01:18.598
a little background.

23
00:01:18.598 --> 00:01:22.565
How did you originally begin this part of your career?

24
00:01:22.565 --> 00:01:24.592
You were an electrical engineer by trade, right?

25
00:01:24.592 --> 00:01:25.381
<v ->Civil.</v>

26
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:26.789
<v Regina>Civil engineer by trade.</v>

27
00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:28.581
So how did you originally get into this

28
00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:31.633
form of using essentially building blocks of

29
00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:33.850
the physical universe for healing?

30
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.962
<v ->I worked with a physicist</v>

31
00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:40.251
who is a very knowledgeable individual and we

32
00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:44.363
were working on the energetic development of gold.

33
00:01:44.602 --> 00:01:48.699
And basically in nature, gold nuggets in streams

34
00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:52.965
are developed energetically as the water flows

35
00:01:52.965 --> 00:01:56.037
in picking up energy in the various

36
00:01:56.037 --> 00:01:59.785
contacts of rocks along the way.

37
00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:02.758
The energy comes together and at some given point

38
00:02:02.758 --> 00:02:05.957
the final link in the formula,

39
00:02:05.957 --> 00:02:09.199
nature's formula, basically comes into play

40
00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:13.082
and when that happens, the gold develops into

41
00:02:13.082 --> 00:02:14.938
a micron particle.

42
00:02:14.938 --> 00:02:19.567
And it has an attraction to its own kind, and it basically

43
00:02:19.567 --> 00:02:22.468
finds another particle and gold nuggets build

44
00:02:22.468 --> 00:02:25.156
particle upon particle upon particle.

45
00:02:25.156 --> 00:02:28.185
And in trying to develop the understanding of

46
00:02:28.185 --> 00:02:31.108
how we could make that happen in a set,

47
00:02:31.108 --> 00:02:33.690
rather than a natural setting, but in a home setting,

48
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.404
we were working with energy and energy from various rocks.

49
00:02:38.404 --> 00:02:41.604
And it was his opinion that at some point,

50
00:02:41.604 --> 00:02:44.229
everything reduces to mathematical numbers.

51
00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:47.023
If you could ever establish that point.

52
00:02:47.023 --> 00:02:50.821
And I basically in my approach to doing my work

53
00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:53.572
I doused out and asked the question, and got

54
00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:58.131
the confirmation that yes, it is all a mathematical reality.

55
00:02:58.436 --> 00:03:01.466
<v Regina>So in that sense, not to put a mystical</v>

56
00:03:01.466 --> 00:03:04.068
spin on it, but it seems to often

57
00:03:04.068 --> 00:03:06.350
be equated with that.

58
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.000
This was alchemy in a sense --

59
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.062
<v ->Strictly.</v>

60
00:03:10.062 --> 00:03:11.299
<v Regina>Strictly, yes.</v>

61
00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.341
<v ->Oh, right to the T.</v>

62
00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:17.827
And not knowing all that the alchemists may have known

63
00:03:17.827 --> 00:03:20.942
we were basically trying to find our own way there

64
00:03:20.942 --> 00:03:24.463
by duplicating mother nature where we could

65
00:03:24.463 --> 00:03:28.495
witness and we'd go to streams where gold is basically

66
00:03:28.495 --> 00:03:32.483
extractable from the gravel and then measure the energies

67
00:03:32.483 --> 00:03:35.171
that are all accumulating at that point

68
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:38.159
and trying to identify each and every one so that

69
00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.656
we could nail down the

70
00:03:41.656 --> 00:03:46.656
capability of producing metal in a very, totally alchemic...

71
00:03:48.504 --> 00:03:51.698
<v Regina>Alchemical. Alchemically.</v>

72
00:03:52.152 --> 00:03:55.864
<v ->Alchemical form, and that was the venture that we were on</v>

73
00:03:55.864 --> 00:03:59.213
and then I basically had some health issues myself

74
00:03:59.213 --> 00:04:02.264
and started to pursue how I could help my own

75
00:04:02.264 --> 00:04:05.656
health issues and that was really my insight

76
00:04:05.656 --> 00:04:10.456
into what we could do in a real world,

77
00:04:10.456 --> 00:04:12.611
but I was doing it even at that time

78
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:17.026
in having to have the physical energy from rocks.

79
00:04:17.026 --> 00:04:19.608
That bore the energy that we were looking for

80
00:04:19.608 --> 00:04:22.018
that I had determined would be beneficial.

81
00:04:22.018 --> 00:04:24.685
It was only after that that I determined

82
00:04:24.685 --> 00:04:28.441
that all this stuff is really frequency based,

83
00:04:28.441 --> 00:04:32.280
and frequencies are all controlled by mathematics.

84
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.650
If in fact you had a machine that put out a frequency

85
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.170
you're gonna input numbers to create that frequency

86
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.711
and so why not you be the machine?

87
00:04:42.711 --> 00:04:46.338
So that realization, that by taking a number and

88
00:04:46.338 --> 00:04:49.218
repeating it, it's like a mantra, at some point

89
00:04:49.218 --> 00:04:52.333
that number is part of you and you've just sent

90
00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:55.575
an intention to the body as you would be doing

91
00:04:55.575 --> 00:04:58.391
if it was a frequency machine, or whether it was a

92
00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:02.659
pharmaceutical chemically originated drug,

93
00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:06.370
which has an energy pattern, and we determined

94
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.061
that the mathematics is basically the control

95
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:11.980
of all energy.

96
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.199
<v Regina>Well this brings up a couple different</v>

97
00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:15.436
lines of thought.

98
00:05:15.436 --> 00:05:17.612
So let's go back to the devices you were talking about.

99
00:05:17.612 --> 00:05:20.449
You were referring I assume to say, Rife type

100
00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.327
technologies for example, where a

101
00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:27.404
there is a protocol book that was created by

102
00:05:27.404 --> 00:05:30.135
Roe, Rim, and Rife and expanded on

103
00:05:30.135 --> 00:05:32.887
and also other versions of it created by other individuals

104
00:05:32.887 --> 00:05:34.273
throughout history.

105
00:05:34.273 --> 00:05:37.601
And you have a box that generates a particular frequency,

106
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:40.054
that frequency is given a numeric value.

107
00:05:40.054 --> 00:05:42.956
So you're saying cut out the middle man,

108
00:05:42.956 --> 00:05:44.385
i.e. cut out the box.

109
00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:46.262
<v ->Yeah that's what we discovered that</v>

110
00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:49.143
not knowing their frequencies as whether or not

111
00:05:49.143 --> 00:05:52.342
the electrical interplay in the machine

112
00:05:52.342 --> 00:05:56.801
basically produced a benefit by their numbering system

113
00:05:56.801 --> 00:05:59.873
and we don't use the electrical interplay

114
00:05:59.873 --> 00:06:03.286
so my numbers don't require that,

115
00:06:03.286 --> 00:06:05.847
and I don't know whether that is good or bad

116
00:06:05.847 --> 00:06:08.961
but the fact is you are the interplay yourself,

117
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:12.816
you are the frequency generator.

118
00:06:14.038 --> 00:06:18.070
<v Regina>Well it's becoming more and more refined,</v>

119
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.779
or the term they use in the field of quantum physics

120
00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:23.446
is more elegant in that

121
00:06:23.446 --> 00:06:26.390
we're reducing these potentials,

122
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.038
the field of potentials as time goes on down to

123
00:06:30.038 --> 00:06:32.384
some very simple concepts really.

124
00:06:32.384 --> 00:06:34.475
We're looking at, in your case we're looking at

125
00:06:34.475 --> 00:06:37.120
numbers and intention.

126
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.488
Now what is the difference between using the numbers

127
00:06:41.792 --> 00:06:45.413
versus just going directly to the intention alone?

128
00:06:45.973 --> 00:06:50.540
<v ->If you can perfect the intention accurate enough</v>

129
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.440
that the body recognizes the intention,

130
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.765
then you perhaps don't need numbers.

131
00:06:55.765 --> 00:06:59.862
But the precision of a concept, and to be able to hold

132
00:06:59.862 --> 00:07:03.168
that concept so precise that you can pass it

133
00:07:03.168 --> 00:07:06.602
to somebody else and it's interpreted exactly the same way

134
00:07:06.602 --> 00:07:09.056
as you had done your success,

135
00:07:09.056 --> 00:07:10.678
is probably the problem.

136
00:07:10.678 --> 00:07:14.069
The mathematical equation puts you into almost

137
00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:18.101
a state of meditation

138
00:07:18.101 --> 00:07:21.578
but it's a controlled meditation and you meditate the number

139
00:07:21.578 --> 00:07:24.096
and you meditate the number again,

140
00:07:24.096 --> 00:07:27.701
so the control over the thought is so much more accurately

141
00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:31.519
delivered in a mathematical equation

142
00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:35.317
than it would be in a thought process which has a

143
00:07:35.317 --> 00:07:38.346
possibility of variating from one person to the next.

144
00:07:38.346 --> 00:07:40.569
<v Regina>Well it has emotions, it has filters,</v>

145
00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:42.826
it has misinterpretations, I can see what you're saying.

146
00:07:42.826 --> 00:07:45.386
So it creates more of a precision but also

147
00:07:45.386 --> 00:07:47.583
you just said something really key, it seems that

148
00:07:47.583 --> 00:07:51.722
those numbers, okay so when you have identified through

149
00:07:51.722 --> 00:07:55.136
using the dousing rods, what is going on with an individual,

150
00:07:55.136 --> 00:07:57.588
that's your method for divination?

151
00:07:57.588 --> 00:08:00.106
Of getting very precise, and you've worked on this for

152
00:08:00.106 --> 00:08:02.879
eight years to develop the protocols and be very precise

153
00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:05.908
as to the causal effects, be it spiritual, mental,

154
00:08:05.908 --> 00:08:08.468
emotional, physical, bacterial, you name it,

155
00:08:08.468 --> 00:08:12.266
you've got that part down, so once you've identified

156
00:08:12.266 --> 00:08:16.340
what the issue is and you then have a numerical

157
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.433
sequence for a person, is the person then

158
00:08:19.433 --> 00:08:23.572
to hold the intention while they read that number?

159
00:08:23.572 --> 00:08:27.449
Or is the intention now embedded in the number?

160
00:08:27.476 --> 00:08:29.311
<v ->The intention is the number.</v>

161
00:08:29.311 --> 00:08:32.190
The number is the message, and that is what sends

162
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.281
the intention to the body.

163
00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:38.036
Now what we do is that we don't determine or diagnose

164
00:08:38.036 --> 00:08:40.852
anything, all we do is check numbers.

165
00:08:40.852 --> 00:08:44.009
We have developed a book of numbers

166
00:08:44.009 --> 00:08:46.562
that deal with normalcy in various parts of

167
00:08:46.562 --> 00:08:48.239
the functions of the body.

168
00:08:48.239 --> 00:08:50.004
<v Regina>Bounds are out of balance.</v>

169
00:08:50.004 --> 00:08:51.618
<v ->That's right, so all we do is check to see if</v>

170
00:08:51.618 --> 00:08:52.872
you have the number.

171
00:08:52.872 --> 00:08:55.304
If you don't have the number it's very possible

172
00:08:55.304 --> 00:08:57.138
you have the problem.

173
00:08:57.138 --> 00:09:00.146
And so we basically introduce you to the number

174
00:09:00.146 --> 00:09:04.936
and as you basically utilize and repeat that number

175
00:09:04.936 --> 00:09:09.761
over, any number six, seven, eight, nine, ten times

176
00:09:09.917 --> 00:09:13.778
then you basically send an intention to the body

177
00:09:13.778 --> 00:09:17.150
and that number now becomes part of the body

178
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:21.372
and you now have moved back into balance.

179
00:09:21.372 --> 00:09:24.359
It's not unlike a radio, that you turn a radio

180
00:09:24.359 --> 00:09:26.620
to a certain number on a dial

181
00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.501
and you get a certain frequency, you get a certain program.

182
00:09:29.501 --> 00:09:31.827
Now if that number gets slightly off,

183
00:09:31.827 --> 00:09:34.152
all you have is static, you can't hear the program

184
00:09:34.152 --> 00:09:36.029
you have to adjust the number.

185
00:09:36.029 --> 00:09:37.692
The body functions

186
00:09:37.692 --> 00:09:41.703
literally the same way in that you have frequencies

187
00:09:41.703 --> 00:09:44.817
in your body, perhaps as many as 1.2 million

188
00:09:44.817 --> 00:09:46.865
frequencies in the human body.

189
00:09:46.865 --> 00:09:49.383
And they've all got a very precise number.

190
00:09:49.383 --> 00:09:52.220
Now if you get off number, then you basically are delivering

191
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.679
static to that unit in your body, whatever role its playing

192
00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:59.665
in the systems, each one of these frequencies is

193
00:09:59.665 --> 00:10:02.673
delivering a part of a system, or a part of

194
00:10:02.673 --> 00:10:05.895
an energy pattern, and if it's off frequency

195
00:10:05.895 --> 00:10:07.942
then it isn't getting delivered,

196
00:10:07.942 --> 00:10:10.993
and so what it's role is in the body isn't getting

197
00:10:10.993 --> 00:10:15.581
supplied and consequently the body's out of balance.

198
00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:18.609
So we don't diagnose anything, we just look

199
00:10:18.609 --> 00:10:20.422
for missing numbers.

200
00:10:20.422 --> 00:10:22.897
<v Regina>Right, and it needs to be made clear</v>

201
00:10:22.897 --> 00:10:25.499
this is not a medical model, not based on medicine,

202
00:10:25.499 --> 00:10:28.166
has nothing to do with the medical model whatsoever

203
00:10:28.166 --> 00:10:30.705
you're looking at frequencies, you're looking at energetic

204
00:10:30.705 --> 00:10:33.286
imbalances and balances and you're identifying them

205
00:10:33.286 --> 00:10:36.230
by number, and you're also helping rebalance

206
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.110
that particular missing frequency by number.

207
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.540
<v ->Yes. Totally.</v>

208
00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:44.635
<v Regina>So going back to where we were a moment ago,</v>

209
00:10:44.635 --> 00:10:49.009
that number becomes a very precise mantra

210
00:10:49.009 --> 00:10:52.400
for that particular field that's out of balance.

211
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.198
An aspect of your blood, be it an organ,

212
00:10:56.198 --> 00:11:01.198
a gland, muscular tissues, it really can be anything at all.

213
00:11:01.894 --> 00:11:05.798
<v ->It is and it's primarily we describe what we do</v>

214
00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:08.934
as an automobile and we look after the engine,

215
00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:11.088
the transmission, the running gear,

216
00:11:11.088 --> 00:11:15.141
all of which has to be very precise in order to function.

217
00:11:15.141 --> 00:11:18.591
And it's the same in every vehicle.

218
00:11:19.153 --> 00:11:21.500
It's got a motor, it's got a transmission, there may

219
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.653
be variations in the motor, but it is a motor

220
00:11:23.653 --> 00:11:25.253
it is a transmission.

221
00:11:25.253 --> 00:11:28.731
Now when it comes to the emotional side of the body,

222
00:11:28.731 --> 00:11:31.161
which is very important, I'm not belittling it,

223
00:11:31.161 --> 00:11:33.187
or the spiritual side of the body, which is also

224
00:11:33.187 --> 00:11:36.452
very important, they can also have a wide range

225
00:11:36.452 --> 00:11:39.267
of choice in those areas.

226
00:11:39.267 --> 00:11:42.766
It isn't so defined as the motor, the transmission,

227
00:11:42.766 --> 00:11:44.771
the braking system is concerned.

228
00:11:44.771 --> 00:11:47.374
You have a choice, you can be one religion

229
00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:50.787
you can be another, and you get along quite nicely in life.

230
00:11:50.787 --> 00:11:54.265
So we basically deal with the running gear,

231
00:11:54.265 --> 00:11:58.488
that part that can be turned in to a mathematical reality

232
00:11:58.488 --> 00:12:02.179
which is very difficult to do in the emotional end of it

233
00:12:02.179 --> 00:12:06.893
because it is so much more varied, and

234
00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:10.349
it's very hard to pin down what is right and what is wrong.

235
00:12:10.349 --> 00:12:13.165
<v Regina>The building blocks that you work with</v>

236
00:12:13.165 --> 00:12:15.341
often fundamentally from what I understand,

237
00:12:15.341 --> 00:12:18.136
are your chromosomal structure of any given person

238
00:12:18.136 --> 00:12:20.866
to see if there are chromosomes that are off.

239
00:12:20.866 --> 00:12:24.600
<v ->We work as much as we can at the stem cell</v>

240
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.522
and the chromosome level, and get back to the

241
00:12:27.522 --> 00:12:31.000
very basics and make sure that the very basic part

242
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.944
of the human body is in balance.

243
00:12:33.944 --> 00:12:37.655
And we find that by doing that, that more often than not

244
00:12:37.655 --> 00:12:40.855
a lot of corrections are made by the body itself

245
00:12:40.855 --> 00:12:44.227
because you are now in balance and perhaps your

246
00:12:44.227 --> 00:12:48.066
ill health has been an out of balance situation

247
00:12:48.066 --> 00:12:51.991
and so we attempt to find the very bases

248
00:12:51.991 --> 00:12:55.255
of a balance and work from that level.

249
00:12:55.255 --> 00:12:58.732
<v Regina>That brings me to the formation, the chromosomes,</v>

250
00:12:58.732 --> 00:13:03.732
in utero, so you, I remember last time we were talking

251
00:13:03.746 --> 00:13:07.116
you were telling me a little bit about what happens

252
00:13:07.116 --> 00:13:09.634
in utero, cause can these chromosomes

253
00:13:09.634 --> 00:13:12.444
be corrected in utero?

254
00:13:12.855 --> 00:13:14.946
<v ->In the human body? Oh yes.</v>

255
00:13:14.946 --> 00:13:16.904
<v Regina>I mean as a baby's developing as a fetus</v>

256
00:13:16.904 --> 00:13:18.935
is developing, let's talk about that from the very beginning

257
00:13:18.935 --> 00:13:21.495
and then influences the mother onto the child.

258
00:13:21.495 --> 00:13:25.734
<v ->We've never had an opportunity to work at the fetal stage</v>

259
00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:29.708
but certainly once they are a live human being,

260
00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:31.948
yes we've worked with some children that have been

261
00:13:31.948 --> 00:13:34.999
very very young, have had some major problems

262
00:13:34.999 --> 00:13:39.244
and heading for major operations in the medical field

263
00:13:39.244 --> 00:13:41.953
and by disbalancing their energy, the operations

264
00:13:41.953 --> 00:13:45.516
were diverted and never did have to be taken

265
00:13:45.516 --> 00:13:48.630
so it's a matter of being able to balance out their basic

266
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:52.150
energy and so it can happen, and animals

267
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.454
are even more receptive.

268
00:13:54.454 --> 00:13:57.590
Although small children are very reactive,

269
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:59.638
they're very receptive, animals --

270
00:13:59.638 --> 00:14:01.537
<v Regina>Because they don't have the belief systems</v>

271
00:14:01.537 --> 00:14:02.838
in place that this is impossible.

272
00:14:02.838 --> 00:14:06.160
<v ->Right, and they're not dealing with that element.</v>

273
00:14:06.187 --> 00:14:08.513
<v Regina>I just remembered that the thing we were talking</v>

274
00:14:08.513 --> 00:14:12.304
about before is something about the fetus

275
00:14:12.587 --> 00:14:16.065
absorbing certain nutrients? Chemicals?

276
00:14:16.065 --> 00:14:18.326
What are they from the atmosphere?

277
00:14:18.326 --> 00:14:20.353
And this effect, can you talk about that?

278
00:14:20.353 --> 00:14:22.400
<v ->Well the concept I have is that it's strictly</v>

279
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.022
an energy source.

280
00:14:24.022 --> 00:14:27.243
And energy coming throughout the universe

281
00:14:27.243 --> 00:14:29.548
comes from many sources, it can be from the sun

282
00:14:29.548 --> 00:14:31.575
it can be from the solar system,

283
00:14:31.575 --> 00:14:34.283
but these are energies that exist in the solar

284
00:14:34.283 --> 00:14:37.050
pattern around the Earth.

285
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.726
And three of the ingredients that I've identified

286
00:14:40.726 --> 00:14:43.030
that I believe are up there is hydrogen 2,

287
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.845
which is called deuterium, technetium,

288
00:14:45.845 --> 00:14:50.624
which is an energy in our periodic chart,

289
00:14:50.624 --> 00:14:53.803
it's recognized as an energy or as a mineral

290
00:14:53.803 --> 00:14:56.981
but it also recognized not to be found on Earth

291
00:14:56.981 --> 00:15:00.651
other than its scrap form which is basically

292
00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:05.039
remnants of a shooting star or solar activity.

293
00:15:06.049 --> 00:15:08.650
And the third one is promethium, and promethium

294
00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:11.061
is an energy that is also recognized

295
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:14.646
that has very low identification of extraction

296
00:15:14.646 --> 00:15:16.608
on the face of the Earth, but apparently

297
00:15:16.608 --> 00:15:20.021
there has been some extraction in that mineral form.

298
00:15:20.021 --> 00:15:22.496
But these are energetic minerals

299
00:15:22.496 --> 00:15:26.207
that do come into the fetus.

300
00:15:26.207 --> 00:15:28.810
There's no indication that the mother takes them on

301
00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:32.074
but the fetus has the ability to draw them in,

302
00:15:32.074 --> 00:15:35.679
both animal and human, to draw in these energies

303
00:15:35.679 --> 00:15:37.663
in the development stage.

304
00:15:37.663 --> 00:15:41.951
My opinion is that in some cases, for whatever reason,

305
00:15:41.951 --> 00:15:44.725
some of these minerals are deficient in the

306
00:15:44.725 --> 00:15:48.010
fetal development, and when that happens

307
00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.890
then you end up with consequence of

308
00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:55.022
perhaps autism, it would be a good example.

309
00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:59.274
Autism is perhaps somewhat brought on

310
00:15:59.274 --> 00:16:02.410
by a deficiency in this development state.

311
00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:04.799
Now either because of the influence of the mother

312
00:16:04.799 --> 00:16:08.675
or perhaps of the diminishing energy of that type.

313
00:16:09.023 --> 00:16:11.540
And it may well be that it is diminishing

314
00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.612
in its form on Earth to the point

315
00:16:14.612 --> 00:16:17.492
that you don't get quite enough of it.

316
00:16:17.492 --> 00:16:19.988
And that being the case, it may be something

317
00:16:19.988 --> 00:16:22.356
that someday we may look to supplement

318
00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:25.769
in the development of fetal,

319
00:16:25.769 --> 00:16:28.201
and in order to make sure that that happens

320
00:16:28.201 --> 00:16:31.401
and it has effect on the offspring

321
00:16:31.401 --> 00:16:35.476
and in the digestive tract, and this hydrogen 2

322
00:16:35.476 --> 00:16:38.926
is deficient in the fetal development.

323
00:16:39.188 --> 00:16:41.726
And these are all theoretical because obviously

324
00:16:41.726 --> 00:16:44.415
I haven't got the power to work with them,

325
00:16:44.415 --> 00:16:47.273
but in working with autism and what not

326
00:16:47.273 --> 00:16:50.707
I get the indication that that there are some deficiencies

327
00:16:50.707 --> 00:16:52.905
developing from the mother

328
00:16:52.905 --> 00:16:56.501
and of course it plays out in an autistic form after birth.

329
00:16:56.501 --> 00:16:58.815
<v Regina>Well how did you even discover the</v>

330
00:16:58.815 --> 00:17:01.503
importance of the role of these particular energetic

331
00:17:01.503 --> 00:17:03.551
signatures or nutrients?

332
00:17:03.551 --> 00:17:06.858
<v ->Well I basically just asked the question and my wand</v>

333
00:17:06.858 --> 00:17:10.313
will move and answer yes or it wont move

334
00:17:10.313 --> 00:17:11.635
and it'll give me no.

335
00:17:11.635 --> 00:17:13.151
So I can ask any question I want.

336
00:17:13.151 --> 00:17:15.198
<v Regina>But I'm thinking how did you ever even</v>

337
00:17:15.198 --> 00:17:17.544
refine it down to the discovery of these three

338
00:17:17.544 --> 00:17:22.424
energetic forces or energetic minerals?

339
00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:27.656
<v ->It happens periodically without having any real</v>

340
00:17:27.656 --> 00:17:31.006
explanation, it's just a whim or a thought

341
00:17:31.006 --> 00:17:34.803
and I get asking questions and I get some guidance,

342
00:17:34.803 --> 00:17:38.877
but all at once it will show up

343
00:17:38.877 --> 00:17:41.033
as something to look into, and then I start

344
00:17:41.033 --> 00:17:44.339
to deal with that and then I find, oh that comes from heaven

345
00:17:45.769 --> 00:17:50.120
and it's just very difficult at this stage to tell you

346
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.192
precisely when these things, sort of the lights went on,

347
00:17:53.192 --> 00:17:55.666
<v Regina>Right, but it is interesting cause this is</v>

348
00:17:55.666 --> 00:17:58.162
this whole hydrogen 2 and these various,

349
00:17:58.162 --> 00:18:01.064
again energetic nutrients or minerals you've talked about

350
00:18:01.064 --> 00:18:03.113
are not things we commonly hear about.

351
00:18:03.113 --> 00:18:05.779
<v ->No, and that's probably part of the missing link</v>

352
00:18:05.779 --> 00:18:09.064
in research as to the energetic reality

353
00:18:09.064 --> 00:18:12.520
of what we are, and what life is is really only starting

354
00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.184
to come to light.

355
00:18:14.184 --> 00:18:18.749
That we can start to realize that hey, we are but energy

356
00:18:18.749 --> 00:18:22.418
and my theory in a very simple form is

357
00:18:22.418 --> 00:18:25.127
that we perhaps are nothing more than

358
00:18:25.127 --> 00:18:27.069
a can of soda.

359
00:18:27.069 --> 00:18:30.119
And we come out of heaven in form of energy

360
00:18:30.119 --> 00:18:34.215
and we are basically given life at the birth.

361
00:18:34.215 --> 00:18:38.034
And we basically exhaust that can of soda

362
00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:40.893
throughout life until finally it's empty

363
00:18:40.893 --> 00:18:43.644
and the can goes back to heaven

364
00:18:43.644 --> 00:18:46.823
where it's basically recycled back in and refilled

365
00:18:46.823 --> 00:18:49.249
and it comes back in the form of life.

366
00:18:49.249 --> 00:18:53.579
So perhaps the energy of life is non-creatable

367
00:18:53.579 --> 00:18:56.011
and certainly non-destructible.

368
00:18:56.011 --> 00:18:58.401
It's just an evolution of use of energy

369
00:18:58.401 --> 00:19:01.494
for various periods of time.

370
00:19:01.494 --> 00:19:04.993
And so the closer, my opinion is

371
00:19:04.993 --> 00:19:07.660
the closest and the simpler you can get

372
00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.368
in dealing with a concept of nature,

373
00:19:10.368 --> 00:19:12.587
the closer you are to the reality.

374
00:19:12.587 --> 00:19:15.488
<v Regina>Yes and it makes total sense, we cannot</v>

375
00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:18.774
not be impacted by the cosmos, not only in our

376
00:19:18.774 --> 00:19:21.376
development but in our day-to-day living.

377
00:19:21.376 --> 00:19:24.384
That is as much a part of us as the Earth is a part of us

378
00:19:24.384 --> 00:19:27.755
elementally speaking, so do you supplement

379
00:19:27.755 --> 00:19:32.469
the body or the being with this H2 number

380
00:19:32.469 --> 00:19:35.093
or do you go into those specific elements

381
00:19:35.093 --> 00:19:36.523
we just spoke about?

382
00:19:36.523 --> 00:19:38.528
<v ->Well we create several products.</v>

383
00:19:38.528 --> 00:19:40.576
Some of them are in number form

384
00:19:40.576 --> 00:19:44.480
and you basically impose those numbers on your body

385
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.848
or we also create a water product

386
00:19:46.848 --> 00:19:50.688
and the water is charged with these energy numbers.

387
00:19:50.688 --> 00:19:52.886
<v Regina>Homeopathically, really?</v>

388
00:19:52.886 --> 00:19:55.829
<v ->As close to homeopathy as you can imagine.</v>

389
00:19:57.049 --> 00:20:01.056
So by having that in to water, when you consume the water

390
00:20:01.056 --> 00:20:03.850
or even hold the water, particularly on the left

391
00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.410
hand side of your body, excuse me.

392
00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:10.165
Left hand side of your body is your incoming energy flow.

393
00:20:10.165 --> 00:20:12.811
The right hand side is your exhaust or

394
00:20:12.811 --> 00:20:16.309
your exhausting of energy, so you want all your energy

395
00:20:16.309 --> 00:20:18.464
to flow in the left hand side.

396
00:20:18.464 --> 00:20:21.855
And so by doing that, these energies can come

397
00:20:21.855 --> 00:20:24.757
either from the water, in contact with

398
00:20:24.757 --> 00:20:26.527
the left hand side of the body,

399
00:20:26.527 --> 00:20:28.895
the energy from the water will actually extend

400
00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:32.116
into the body, or you can do it with numbers.

401
00:20:32.116 --> 00:20:34.847
By placing numbers on the left hand side of the body,

402
00:20:34.847 --> 00:20:37.812
believe it or not, but the numbers will actually

403
00:20:37.812 --> 00:20:41.184
the intent will actually enter in to the body.

404
00:20:41.184 --> 00:20:42.996
<v Regina>Yeah, sure. It makes sense.</v>

405
00:20:42.996 --> 00:20:47.199
<v ->And I see no other explanation for it other than</v>

406
00:20:47.199 --> 00:20:50.740
everything has an intention, and the body

407
00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:55.064
recognizes that intention and is able to absorb it.

408
00:20:55.064 --> 00:20:57.944
And perhaps that's the least understood about

409
00:20:57.944 --> 00:21:02.418
the human body, is how does it understand intention?

410
00:21:02.829 --> 00:21:05.944
And perhaps that is really the secret of the human body

411
00:21:05.944 --> 00:21:08.738
is that it's abilities do understand intentions.

412
00:21:08.738 --> 00:21:12.152
<v Regina>Yes, I mean this is in the terms of some people</v>

413
00:21:12.152 --> 00:21:15.623
this is a quantum virtual reality

414
00:21:15.822 --> 00:21:18.296
that is all highly programmable, programmable with

415
00:21:18.296 --> 00:21:21.666
our thoughts, our beliefs, our feelings and everything else.

416
00:21:21.666 --> 00:21:23.928
Handed down customs, traditions,

417
00:21:23.928 --> 00:21:25.592
and belief systems.

418
00:21:25.592 --> 00:21:28.749
I wanted to go back just for a moment to the

419
00:21:28.749 --> 00:21:30.775
subject of autism.

420
00:21:30.775 --> 00:21:34.403
When we talked before, last week I think it was,

421
00:21:34.403 --> 00:21:36.791
we were talking about subject of enzymes

422
00:21:36.791 --> 00:21:40.882
turning food into toxins in the body.

423
00:21:41.506 --> 00:21:44.279
<v ->Well I'm not an authority on autism,</v>

424
00:21:44.279 --> 00:21:47.736
but it appears that at some stage of infancy

425
00:21:47.736 --> 00:21:50.508
for whatever reason, that the body may be

426
00:21:50.508 --> 00:21:54.476
totally normal, but it takes on an abnormality

427
00:21:54.476 --> 00:21:57.336
at some point, maybe at the age of three or

428
00:21:57.336 --> 00:21:59.148
around that time frame.

429
00:21:59.148 --> 00:22:03.139
And all at once this autism experience starts to evolve.

430
00:22:03.139 --> 00:22:07.020
And there's a good possiblity that the shortage

431
00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.071
of that energy I spoke of just briefly,

432
00:22:10.071 --> 00:22:13.356
basically doesn't allow certain enzymes to develop

433
00:22:13.356 --> 00:22:15.618
in the digestive system.

434
00:22:15.618 --> 00:22:18.305
So consequently the intaking of food and maybe

435
00:22:18.305 --> 00:22:20.738
the changing of food types

436
00:22:20.738 --> 00:22:24.876
leads to a development of a toxic

437
00:22:24.876 --> 00:22:28.695
capability rather than an energy capability.

438
00:22:28.695 --> 00:22:31.340
And so it's a matter of what is it that's missing

439
00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:34.774
in the body because there seems to be some evidence

440
00:22:34.774 --> 00:22:38.806
of research going on as to when they watch the diet

441
00:22:38.806 --> 00:22:42.262
or have a very specific diet that the degree of autism

442
00:22:42.262 --> 00:22:46.188
can be reversed to far more to normalcy,

443
00:22:46.188 --> 00:22:48.897
which would play into my concept that

444
00:22:48.897 --> 00:22:53.057
there is a missing link in the body's ability

445
00:22:53.057 --> 00:22:57.046
to convert food into an energy form

446
00:22:57.046 --> 00:22:59.094
in these particular situations.

447
00:22:59.094 --> 00:23:02.294
Now there's many people feel that the immunization

448
00:23:02.294 --> 00:23:05.963
step is the trigger that brings on the autism.

449
00:23:05.963 --> 00:23:10.963
In our realm of study, it plays a more minor role

450
00:23:11.211 --> 00:23:15.286
than a major role, but we have evidence that plastic

451
00:23:15.286 --> 00:23:18.977
plays a much bigger role, and the energies in plastic

452
00:23:18.977 --> 00:23:21.728
contributing to this autistic move,

453
00:23:21.728 --> 00:23:26.728
along with the, I think it's called Thermasol --

454
00:23:28.064 --> 00:23:29.686
<v Regina>Thimerosal.</v>

455
00:23:29.686 --> 00:23:32.439
<v ->Thimerosal, yeah. Thimerosal is also a contributor</v>

456
00:23:32.439 --> 00:23:36.058
but it is not a big player as plastics are.

457
00:23:36.213 --> 00:23:38.411
<v Regina>And you're talking about plastics that would</v>

458
00:23:38.411 --> 00:23:40.992
be absorbed say from the time a baby goes onto

459
00:23:40.992 --> 00:23:43.020
formulas for example.

460
00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:46.155
<v ->Could well be in the content of the baby bottle.</v>

461
00:23:46.155 --> 00:23:50.272
Could be in the effect of a plastic in their crib.

462
00:23:50.272 --> 00:23:54.240
I mean it's not all plastics that are a contributor

463
00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.650
but there are certain plastics that may be

464
00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:58.293
a major contributor.

465
00:23:58.293 --> 00:24:00.661
That research has to be carried out to

466
00:24:00.661 --> 00:24:02.881
determine that to be the case.

467
00:24:02.881 --> 00:24:06.017
But what we do is we develop numbers that counter

468
00:24:06.017 --> 00:24:09.109
so we don't necessarily go out and spend a bunch

469
00:24:09.109 --> 00:24:12.373
of effort trying to identify the source of these things

470
00:24:12.373 --> 00:24:14.464
we spend more time trying to develop

471
00:24:14.464 --> 00:24:17.045
a number that counters, and so you have

472
00:24:17.045 --> 00:24:19.050
a neutralizing effect.

473
00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:21.482
<v Regina>Have you done this with autism in the past?</v>

474
00:24:21.482 --> 00:24:24.255
<v ->We don't get a lot of autism, we've dealt with a few.</v>

475
00:24:26.425 --> 00:24:29.398
We're dealing with them in a much later stage in life.

476
00:24:29.398 --> 00:24:31.253
Some of them in their twenties.

477
00:24:31.253 --> 00:24:34.282
So it's perhaps a long time gone.

478
00:24:34.282 --> 00:24:37.333
Probably something that would be better dealt with

479
00:24:37.333 --> 00:24:41.279
perhaps in the fetal stage or perhaps

480
00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:45.093
shortly thereafter at the very least.

481
00:24:45.716 --> 00:24:48.746
And maybe we've only got pieces of the puzzle.

482
00:24:48.746 --> 00:24:51.050
We don't have the whole solution but

483
00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.760
we have pieces that should be looked at

484
00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.977
in the solving of the problem.

485
00:24:55.977 --> 00:24:58.047
<v Regina>No, that's very interesting and I hope that</v>

486
00:24:58.047 --> 00:24:59.967
there are people watching this that do have

487
00:24:59.967 --> 00:25:03.253
some research capability, that have studied autism

488
00:25:03.253 --> 00:25:05.664
that might take this information and use it

489
00:25:05.664 --> 00:25:08.009
and plug it in, yeah.

490
00:25:08.009 --> 00:25:10.164
Interesting, well let's talk about

491
00:25:10.164 --> 00:25:14.601
some of the anecdotal situations,

492
00:25:14.601 --> 00:25:16.692
you've been doing this for eight years

493
00:25:16.692 --> 00:25:20.681
and your wife Phyllis spend a lot of time on the road

494
00:25:20.681 --> 00:25:23.412
going to communities who have

495
00:25:23.412 --> 00:25:25.994
experienced your work before and then they invite

496
00:25:25.994 --> 00:25:29.214
you back every few months or at least every year.

497
00:25:29.214 --> 00:25:31.945
The point is you're getting a lot of repeat business.

498
00:25:31.945 --> 00:25:32.968
<v ->Oh, yes.</v>

499
00:25:32.968 --> 00:25:35.252
<v Regina>And that means that you must be doing something</v>

500
00:25:35.252 --> 00:25:37.220
right otherwise you wouldn't be asked back so frequently

501
00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.652
so let's just assume that what you're doing works.

502
00:25:39.652 --> 00:25:42.446
Let's talk about a few situations that you would like

503
00:25:42.446 --> 00:25:44.389
to share, and one of them I'm going to

504
00:25:44.389 --> 00:25:46.714
ask you to share is having to do with the

505
00:25:46.714 --> 00:25:48.820
unruly kids in the classroom.

506
00:25:50.275 --> 00:25:53.277
<v ->The theory is that</v>

507
00:25:53.731 --> 00:25:58.731
you have a dimensional reality in where populations

508
00:25:59.299 --> 00:26:02.671
are around the world based on any number of things.

509
00:26:02.671 --> 00:26:05.017
Some are controlled by religions, some of them

510
00:26:05.017 --> 00:26:06.894
are controlled by fear.

511
00:26:06.894 --> 00:26:10.542
Some of them are controlled by lack of education I suppose.

512
00:26:10.542 --> 00:26:14.232
Others in other parts of the world are wide open

513
00:26:14.232 --> 00:26:18.853
to learning and to understanding and perhaps

514
00:26:18.853 --> 00:26:22.952
not so controlled by dogmatic religions.

515
00:26:23.299 --> 00:26:27.459
And you find that the population has a

516
00:26:27.459 --> 00:26:31.000
dimensional presence, and perhaps if we went

517
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.475
back to the very early days,

518
00:26:33.475 --> 00:26:35.715
we were in the first dimension and that would

519
00:26:35.715 --> 00:26:39.229
make us maybe 80% animal and 20% human.

520
00:26:39.619 --> 00:26:42.307
And we basically lived in a cave or whatever it was

521
00:26:42.307 --> 00:26:45.805
available to accommodate, we didn't create

522
00:26:45.805 --> 00:26:48.152
we just basically stayed alive.

523
00:26:48.152 --> 00:26:51.736
And we advanced at some point into the

524
00:26:51.736 --> 00:26:55.384
second dimension, which was perhaps 20% animal

525
00:26:55.384 --> 00:26:59.608
80% human, and we started to learn how to farm

526
00:26:59.608 --> 00:27:02.658
to some extent, we learned how to build

527
00:27:02.658 --> 00:27:06.648
or to help ourself in developing a domicile.

528
00:27:06.648 --> 00:27:10.126
And then we moved into the third dimension,

529
00:27:10.126 --> 00:27:13.517
and the third dimension was early in my lifetime

530
00:27:13.517 --> 00:27:15.758
and on into my middle lifetime,

531
00:27:15.758 --> 00:27:18.061
we were in the third dimension.

532
00:27:18.061 --> 00:27:21.218
And the third dimension is about 20% light perhaps

533
00:27:21.218 --> 00:27:23.159
and about 80% human.

534
00:27:23.159 --> 00:27:25.314
So we've left the animal world by this time

535
00:27:25.314 --> 00:27:30.007
and you are now into the world of the reality of human.

536
00:27:30.007 --> 00:27:33.932
And starting to appreciate the enlightenment

537
00:27:33.932 --> 00:27:36.258
of what we really are.

538
00:27:36.258 --> 00:27:38.135
<v Regina>And these are dimensions of consciousness</v>

539
00:27:38.135 --> 00:27:39.351
that we are expanding?

540
00:27:39.351 --> 00:27:41.271
<v ->That's right and we have no control over them</v>

541
00:27:41.271 --> 00:27:43.596
and we have no way of changing them.

542
00:27:43.596 --> 00:27:46.711
We sort of somebody or something sort of graduates

543
00:27:46.711 --> 00:27:49.335
us into the dimensions.

544
00:27:49.335 --> 00:27:52.408
More recently, probably in the last two or three yerars

545
00:27:52.408 --> 00:27:55.329
we've seen a movement into the fifth dimension.

546
00:27:55.329 --> 00:27:58.295
Now the fourth dimension was a stepping stone

547
00:27:58.295 --> 00:28:00.300
as some people ended up in the fourth dimension

548
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.900
on their way to the fifth.

549
00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.609
Relatively short time duration.

550
00:28:04.609 --> 00:28:09.609
A number of people have moved into the sixth dimension

551
00:28:09.708 --> 00:28:13.121
and the sixth dimension at this time appears to be

552
00:28:13.121 --> 00:28:16.300
out of balance to the energetic surroundings.

553
00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:19.158
<v Regina>What would exemplify that? What type of people</v>

554
00:28:19.158 --> 00:28:20.438
or behaviors?

555
00:28:20.438 --> 00:28:24.038
<v ->You would find it very often in the case of</v>

556
00:28:25.196 --> 00:28:29.200
get my initials right, ADD type of thing.

557
00:28:29.334 --> 00:28:32.919
You'd also find it in perhaps often in the

558
00:28:32.919 --> 00:28:36.225
identification of indigos by name

559
00:28:36.225 --> 00:28:38.977
and these people are in this.

560
00:28:38.977 --> 00:28:42.518
They perhaps are a little more intuitive

561
00:28:42.518 --> 00:28:45.227
than what we would see in the fifth dimension,

562
00:28:45.227 --> 00:28:48.300
but they're also in a very chaotic state of mind.

563
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.942
They can't finish the thought,

564
00:28:49.942 --> 00:28:51.585
they can't create a plan.

565
00:28:51.585 --> 00:28:55.873
Their mind just is not stable enough to allow them

566
00:28:55.873 --> 00:28:58.177
to function properly.

567
00:28:58.177 --> 00:29:00.823
We have developed the ability to be able to bring

568
00:29:00.823 --> 00:29:03.382
them back to the fifth dimension.

569
00:29:03.382 --> 00:29:06.966
And it's not uncommon that once they're back in the

570
00:29:06.966 --> 00:29:10.359
fifth dimension that they move to the eighth dimension.

571
00:29:10.359 --> 00:29:12.854
And the eighth dimension is also a very stable

572
00:29:12.854 --> 00:29:15.584
dimension at this time, so you go five

573
00:29:15.584 --> 00:29:17.163
and you can go to eight.

574
00:29:17.163 --> 00:29:19.915
People that work in the alternative health field

575
00:29:19.915 --> 00:29:23.499
and are dealing with perhaps trying to understand

576
00:29:23.499 --> 00:29:27.253
more the reality of energetics and how it plays

577
00:29:27.253 --> 00:29:30.582
will find themselves all at once in the eighth dimension.

578
00:29:30.582 --> 00:29:32.971
And that type of person --

579
00:29:32.971 --> 00:29:35.957
<v Regina>So this is very expanded type of consciousness</v>

580
00:29:35.957 --> 00:29:37.323
or awareness?

581
00:29:37.323 --> 00:29:40.111
<v ->It's basically just a higher degree of enlightenment.</v>

582
00:29:40.309 --> 00:29:44.682
And so their light may be a 40% enlightened

583
00:29:44.682 --> 00:29:48.543
60% percent human, maybe even 50% enlightened.

584
00:29:48.543 --> 00:29:51.083
So it's more of an enlightenment and perhaps

585
00:29:51.083 --> 00:29:53.343
a day will come that we will

586
00:29:53.343 --> 00:29:56.436
move into the 12th dimension, and

587
00:29:56.436 --> 00:29:59.530
there's virtually nobody in the 12th dimension at this time

588
00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:02.175
but it indicates it's there and someday

589
00:30:02.175 --> 00:30:05.076
you're about 80% enlightened at that time

590
00:30:05.076 --> 00:30:08.063
and 20% human, so it's just a much higher level

591
00:30:08.063 --> 00:30:11.839
of enlightenment, whatever that really means.

592
00:30:11.839 --> 00:30:15.081
<v Regina>That's interesting, now you started this part</v>

593
00:30:15.081 --> 00:30:17.152
of the conversation talking about

594
00:30:17.152 --> 00:30:20.671
the collective type of vibration or dimensional

595
00:30:20.671 --> 00:30:22.868
field within communities.

596
00:30:22.868 --> 00:30:25.172
And I had brought up, and this was based

597
00:30:25.172 --> 00:30:26.985
on our previous conversation too,

598
00:30:26.985 --> 00:30:29.161
a little anecdote you had about

599
00:30:29.161 --> 00:30:33.620
a classroom of kids that were essentially

600
00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:36.073
behaving in a disorderly fashion.

601
00:30:36.073 --> 00:30:38.889
<v ->And there's any number of them in schools today.</v>

602
00:30:38.889 --> 00:30:41.854
The ADD, ADI's, or whatever they're --

603
00:30:41.854 --> 00:30:44.094
<v Regina>But you worked with the teacher</v>

604
00:30:44.094 --> 00:30:46.783
for that class, and I thought this was such a sweet story.

605
00:30:46.783 --> 00:30:49.236
<v ->Yeah, she was basically going to quit teaching</v>

606
00:30:49.236 --> 00:30:52.030
and she had a class of eight or ten students

607
00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:54.654
that were basically reading a book.

608
00:30:54.654 --> 00:30:57.711
And they had read the book the year before,

609
00:30:57.711 --> 00:31:02.276
and they were really learning how to understand

610
00:31:02.276 --> 00:31:05.620
reading and English and

611
00:31:05.626 --> 00:31:09.950
still fumbling over the same basic material.

612
00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:13.754
And so we basically introduced her to the numbers

613
00:31:13.754 --> 00:31:16.932
to bring them out of this potential sixth dimension

614
00:31:16.932 --> 00:31:18.511
that they were probably in,

615
00:31:18.511 --> 00:31:20.729
and bring them back to the fifth.

616
00:31:20.729 --> 00:31:23.652
And so she had these group of children

617
00:31:23.652 --> 00:31:27.001
to repeat, put the number on the blackboard perhaps

618
00:31:27.001 --> 00:31:29.988
and they read the number over and over again

619
00:31:29.988 --> 00:31:33.337
any number of times and all at once she found

620
00:31:33.337 --> 00:31:38.337
that they totally came into a state of mind

621
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:42.021
of concentration, of basically listening,

622
00:31:42.851 --> 00:31:47.851
and then this erratic behavior thing just evaporated away.

623
00:31:47.972 --> 00:31:51.065
And so when she got back to us sometime later

624
00:31:51.065 --> 00:31:54.287
to tell us that she was going to continue teaching.

625
00:31:54.287 --> 00:31:55.780
<v Regina>Interesting --</v>

626
00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.830
<v ->We've also used it in another lady who was a teacher</v>

627
00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:00.473
and she put it on the blackboard.

628
00:32:00.473 --> 00:32:03.225
Never asked the kids to read it, but it's on the blackboard

629
00:32:03.225 --> 00:32:05.743
and it stays on the blackboard that one number.

630
00:32:05.743 --> 00:32:08.878
And she found that the whole classroom,

631
00:32:08.878 --> 00:32:11.482
whether the number had an intention

632
00:32:11.482 --> 00:32:16.482
or whether the fact that perhaps the kids in being kids

633
00:32:16.989 --> 00:32:19.549
would read the number anyway.

634
00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:21.725
It's hard to say just what went on because she didn't

635
00:32:21.725 --> 00:32:24.840
instruct anything, but she said there was a marked

636
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.573
quietness developed in the room and a much

637
00:32:28.573 --> 00:32:33.160
higher attention span and attention availability

638
00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.317
evolved out of that, and there's probably

639
00:32:36.317 --> 00:32:39.581
in some way she managed to drag them out

640
00:32:39.581 --> 00:32:41.288
of that sixth dimension.

641
00:32:41.288 --> 00:32:43.634
<v Regina>Very interesting, that was the anecdote that</v>

642
00:32:43.634 --> 00:32:46.025
I was remembering, but you've worked with

643
00:32:46.025 --> 00:32:49.159
every kind of thing and one of the stories that

644
00:32:49.159 --> 00:32:52.829
I also like is the one about your wife

645
00:32:52.829 --> 00:32:54.791
going into the hospital.

646
00:32:54.791 --> 00:32:56.605
And she was trying to get out, and they said no

647
00:32:56.605 --> 00:32:58.631
you can't go out until you pass the labs.

648
00:32:58.631 --> 00:33:00.871
Can you, would you mind telling us that one?

649
00:33:00.871 --> 00:33:04.775
<v ->She was suffering from a case of walking pneumonia</v>

650
00:33:04.775 --> 00:33:08.252
perhaps is a good example, and there are certain criteria

651
00:33:08.252 --> 00:33:09.661
that they were looking for.

652
00:33:09.661 --> 00:33:13.351
One was that the liver enzymes had to be below

653
00:33:13.351 --> 00:33:17.084
a certain level, and that the oxygen content in the blood

654
00:33:17.084 --> 00:33:19.410
had to be above a certain level.

655
00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:21.245
<v Regina>Or they wouldn't let her out?</v>

656
00:33:21.245 --> 00:33:23.079
<v ->They wouldn't let her out, and she wasn't meeting this</v>

657
00:33:23.079 --> 00:33:25.468
criteria, and whatever treatment they were giving her

658
00:33:25.468 --> 00:33:26.984
wasn't achieving it.

659
00:33:26.984 --> 00:33:30.247
So she phoned me, and she said this is, after getting

660
00:33:30.247 --> 00:33:33.490
the doctor to tell her the criteria, that your oxygen

661
00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:36.967
content has to be above this level and gave her a number

662
00:33:36.967 --> 00:33:40.892
and basically your enzyme level has to be below this number

663
00:33:40.892 --> 00:33:43.473
and she had a number so she phoned me and gave me

664
00:33:43.473 --> 00:33:45.607
the information, this is what we gotta achieve.

665
00:33:45.607 --> 00:33:47.399
So I started working backwards.

666
00:33:47.399 --> 00:33:52.399
How to get the liver enzymes to the adjustable level?

667
00:33:52.945 --> 00:33:54.950
<v Regina>So you just doused your way to a series</v>

668
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:56.294
of numbers that were correct?

669
00:33:56.294 --> 00:33:58.556
<v ->I just asked questions and found out what was</v>

670
00:33:58.556 --> 00:34:00.241
causing the problem.

671
00:34:00.241 --> 00:34:03.014
And I basically came up to me that there was a bacteria

672
00:34:03.014 --> 00:34:06.940
virus in her system that was creating the problem

673
00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.798
and preventing this liver enzyme balance

674
00:34:09.798 --> 00:34:12.678
so I developed a number, give me a number

675
00:34:12.678 --> 00:34:15.644
that will eliminate the bacterial viral condition

676
00:34:15.644 --> 00:34:18.417
in Phyllis' body and I have my own way

677
00:34:18.417 --> 00:34:20.806
of creating that number and in doing so

678
00:34:20.806 --> 00:34:23.067
I developed a number.

679
00:34:23.067 --> 00:34:27.185
Then I also did the same thing with regards to

680
00:34:27.185 --> 00:34:29.787
the oxygen and I came up with two numbers then

681
00:34:29.787 --> 00:34:32.262
I phoned her back and said try these numbers.

682
00:34:32.262 --> 00:34:35.164
So she did the numbers and it basically eliminated

683
00:34:35.164 --> 00:34:38.107
the bacterial virus so the enzyme count

684
00:34:38.107 --> 00:34:41.030
came into comfort, and

685
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:43.846
whatever I did on the oxygen, I can't tell you

686
00:34:43.846 --> 00:34:47.088
it's been years ago, but it basically allowed her

687
00:34:47.088 --> 00:34:49.776
oxygen content to come up in her blood,

688
00:34:49.776 --> 00:34:53.702
and so when the technician came around to do the tests

689
00:34:53.702 --> 00:34:56.945
some hours later, and Phyllis said I will be

690
00:34:56.945 --> 00:34:58.544
going home tomorrow.

691
00:34:58.544 --> 00:35:00.485
And he as much as said, oh yeah.

692
00:35:00.485 --> 00:35:01.851
<v Regina>Good luck.</v>

693
00:35:01.851 --> 00:35:03.280
<v ->Good luck, yeah.</v>

694
00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.822
And he walked her around the corridor, the hospital

695
00:35:06.822 --> 00:35:09.787
as they do, and then took her tests and

696
00:35:09.787 --> 00:35:12.155
you are going home tomorrow.

697
00:35:12.155 --> 00:35:15.163
And so she was basically

698
00:35:15.163 --> 00:35:19.280
eliminated the problem that either the medical

699
00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:23.327
couldn't identify or didn't have the power to adjust.

700
00:35:23.397 --> 00:35:25.872
And so we managed to create the energy

701
00:35:25.872 --> 00:35:28.916
to offset her energy.

702
00:35:29.157 --> 00:35:31.782
The second time that she had a problem

703
00:35:31.782 --> 00:35:35.082
was some years later, and she was in

704
00:35:36.154 --> 00:35:39.439
having a real difficult time with congestive heart disease

705
00:35:39.439 --> 00:35:42.127
and in congestive heart disease, it builds up

706
00:35:42.127 --> 00:35:45.072
a fluid and it enters into the heart chamber

707
00:35:45.072 --> 00:35:48.229
so that the heart is pumping against a concentration

708
00:35:48.229 --> 00:35:50.576
of fluid instead of into a

709
00:35:50.576 --> 00:35:55.561
vacant cavity type of thing.

710
00:35:56.079 --> 00:36:00.346
So in doing so, we had once again a bacterial

711
00:36:00.346 --> 00:36:04.740
viral situation that we had not put our finger on yet

712
00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.834
and so we had developed many others and she had

713
00:36:07.834 --> 00:36:10.244
got rid of those but the problem was still there

714
00:36:10.244 --> 00:36:14.910
so finally, I was able to develop this last number.

715
00:36:15.578 --> 00:36:19.460
And all at once her whole system changed around

716
00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.572
which I was able to identify.

717
00:36:21.572 --> 00:36:24.665
But in the meantime, she had been moving

718
00:36:24.665 --> 00:36:27.887
so little blood through her system that once it started

719
00:36:27.887 --> 00:36:31.642
to open up and move, we feel that some old blood

720
00:36:31.642 --> 00:36:34.373
in the system started to move.

721
00:36:34.373 --> 00:36:37.424
And that was basically in a

722
00:36:37.424 --> 00:36:39.641
congested or a congealed state.

723
00:36:39.641 --> 00:36:43.055
And it entered into her body or into her brain

724
00:36:43.055 --> 00:36:46.297
at some point, and she went into stroke mode.

725
00:36:46.297 --> 00:36:47.791
<v Regina>As a form of a clot.</v>

726
00:36:47.791 --> 00:36:48.921
<v ->As a form of a clot.</v>

727
00:36:48.921 --> 00:36:51.822
And so she went into a stroke mood and she was in

728
00:36:51.822 --> 00:36:54.361
a hospital while this was taking place.

729
00:36:54.361 --> 00:36:57.518
And so I was called to the hospital and when I walked in

730
00:36:57.518 --> 00:37:00.100
her face was drooping, her eyes were buggy,

731
00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.875
and she was slurring and I just said 7788

732
00:37:03.875 --> 00:37:08.078
and she knew the number, that 778899003

733
00:37:08.078 --> 00:37:10.873
is a number that sort of brings all the body

734
00:37:11.843 --> 00:37:16.541
into more of a cooperative effort.

735
00:37:17.742 --> 00:37:20.942
And within ten minutes, the mouth straightened up,

736
00:37:20.942 --> 00:37:23.865
the eye went normal, the slur went away,

737
00:37:23.865 --> 00:37:26.915
and the doctor just stood in amazement

738
00:37:26.915 --> 00:37:29.923
that we had reversed the stroke situation

739
00:37:29.923 --> 00:37:32.888
and that might have been a coincidence or might

740
00:37:32.888 --> 00:37:35.044
have been something we did, who knows.

741
00:37:35.044 --> 00:37:37.256
But the fact is that...

742
00:37:37.667 --> 00:37:40.760
<v Regina>You had enough of a running history to</v>

743
00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.808
suggest that it had some play in it.

744
00:37:42.808 --> 00:37:45.390
Now this gets into the whole subject of placebo.

745
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:49.187
You have many new studies now that say

746
00:37:49.187 --> 00:37:51.000
it really doesn't matter what you do,

747
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.792
it's the belief of the person that's going to have

748
00:37:52.792 --> 00:37:54.413
the greatest effect in the end.

749
00:37:54.413 --> 00:37:56.205
So you could say well maybe it was just

750
00:37:56.205 --> 00:37:58.957
the placebo, she'd seen other situations where

751
00:37:58.957 --> 00:38:00.685
you'd had success with others.

752
00:38:00.685 --> 00:38:03.565
However, this doesn't account for the fact that

753
00:38:03.565 --> 00:38:06.680
it also has worked with animals for example.

754
00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.368
Where there is no such belief system.

755
00:38:09.368 --> 00:38:11.693
Maybe give us an example of an animal or two

756
00:38:11.693 --> 00:38:13.848
that you worked on.

757
00:38:13.848 --> 00:38:16.857
<v ->I think probably our more common animals</v>

758
00:38:16.857 --> 00:38:19.559
is types of cancer.

759
00:38:19.629 --> 00:38:24.277
Dogs with cancer, cats with feline leukemia,

760
00:38:24.277 --> 00:38:27.200
and what not and basically have developed

761
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.269
the numbers that counter those energies.

762
00:38:29.269 --> 00:38:30.912
There'll all energies.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

763
00:38:30.912 --> 00:38:33.749
<v ->They're basically called cancer, but they're an energy.</v>

764
00:38:33.749 --> 00:38:37.098
And it's an excessive in the body, whether it be

765
00:38:37.098 --> 00:38:40.427
in the animal or the human, in excessive form.

766
00:38:40.427 --> 00:38:42.624
So consequently the body starts to

767
00:38:42.624 --> 00:38:45.248
malfunction because of it.

768
00:38:45.248 --> 00:38:48.661
And so you have to negate that energy

769
00:38:48.661 --> 00:38:50.677
by putting another energy pattern in

770
00:38:50.677 --> 00:38:52.511
that compromises it.

771
00:38:52.511 --> 00:38:55.455
And that's really what we do, but it's all done

772
00:38:55.455 --> 00:38:58.614
with numbers because the cancer is a number in itself.

773
00:38:58.614 --> 00:39:00.191
It is a frequency.

774
00:39:00.191 --> 00:39:02.922
And so we basically offset that frequency with

775
00:39:02.922 --> 00:39:05.994
another frequency, now animals are very very responsive.

776
00:39:05.994 --> 00:39:08.831
It takes very little to treat an animal and have

777
00:39:08.831 --> 00:39:10.324
a great deal of success because

778
00:39:10.324 --> 00:39:12.644
they're totally...

779
00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:14.058
<v Regina>Neutral.</v>

780
00:39:14.058 --> 00:39:16.576
<v ->Neutral, yeah they don't have any qualms.</v>

781
00:39:16.576 --> 00:39:19.071
But when you're doing it with them, and you must

782
00:39:19.071 --> 00:39:22.016
do it with your right hand feeding the energy

783
00:39:22.016 --> 00:39:24.084
into their left hand side,

784
00:39:24.084 --> 00:39:26.559
they will get squeamish and they will not

785
00:39:26.559 --> 00:39:28.884
particularly like what you're doing.

786
00:39:28.884 --> 00:39:31.029
They'll want to move so they'll feel that energy

787
00:39:31.029 --> 00:39:33.696
coming in and so sometimes you don't get away

788
00:39:33.696 --> 00:39:36.362
with getting a lot of readings before they

789
00:39:36.362 --> 00:39:37.813
wanna move away on you.

790
00:39:37.813 --> 00:39:39.967
If you're doing a horse, and he decides he doesn't

791
00:39:39.967 --> 00:39:42.442
want anymore of that, you have a more difficult

792
00:39:42.442 --> 00:39:45.130
time persuading than if you have a little pussy cat

793
00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:47.519
that you can somehow wrap in a towel

794
00:39:47.519 --> 00:39:49.078
and make sure it stays.

795
00:39:49.078 --> 00:39:51.253
And we have taken, we have a horse at home,

796
00:39:51.253 --> 00:39:54.026
it's now 31 years of age, that has been down

797
00:39:54.026 --> 00:39:56.650
laying on its side and we have a number

798
00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:59.466
that tells us that when we read that number

799
00:39:59.466 --> 00:40:02.282
that that number, starting from the right hand side,

800
00:40:02.282 --> 00:40:04.991
whatever part of that number is in place

801
00:40:04.991 --> 00:40:08.491
is telling me how far or how close they are

802
00:40:08.491 --> 00:40:10.666
to death because when that number's complete

803
00:40:10.666 --> 00:40:12.372
they're gone.

804
00:40:12.372 --> 00:40:14.379
And so we're able to use that number --

805
00:40:14.379 --> 00:40:15.892
<v Regina>It's a death number.</v>

806
00:40:15.892 --> 00:40:18.026
<v ->Yes, it's a death number. So we're able to use</v>

807
00:40:18.026 --> 00:40:20.586
that number to identify oh, we've gotta move.

808
00:40:20.586 --> 00:40:22.655
<v Regina>We have to do something now because</v>

809
00:40:22.655 --> 00:40:23.786
we're losing them.

810
00:40:23.786 --> 00:40:25.961
<v ->So Phyllis went into the corral, the horse is laying there</v>

811
00:40:25.961 --> 00:40:28.863
basically comatose, and she starts reading numbers

812
00:40:28.863 --> 00:40:32.105
into his left hand side for the heart,

813
00:40:32.105 --> 00:40:35.711
the stomach, the lungs, and she just started

814
00:40:35.711 --> 00:40:39.999
basically pouring in support energy to the horse

815
00:40:39.999 --> 00:40:43.903
and the horse started to move a bit, started to flail

816
00:40:43.903 --> 00:40:46.932
ultimately to where she had to leave the corral

817
00:40:46.932 --> 00:40:49.534
and she came outside the corral and then basically

818
00:40:49.534 --> 00:40:51.412
intuitively said numbers.

819
00:40:51.412 --> 00:40:54.057
And by this time, we've done enough research

820
00:40:54.057 --> 00:40:56.830
and I've done enough to identify that it has had

821
00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:58.900
some hay with mold.

822
00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:03.060
And it has got a case of stachybotrys mold in its body.

823
00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:05.769
And we have numbers that counteract that energy.

824
00:41:05.769 --> 00:41:08.307
So from outside the corral, she basically was

825
00:41:08.307 --> 00:41:11.465
feeding this energy to the horse.

826
00:41:11.465 --> 00:41:14.707
Which would probably be some 75 feet away.

827
00:41:14.707 --> 00:41:18.270
And pretty soon the horse is up on its feet,

828
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:21.769
and night time came on and

829
00:41:21.769 --> 00:41:23.838
woke up the next morning, he's still on his feet now

830
00:41:23.838 --> 00:41:26.099
it's been two and a half years ago.

831
00:41:26.099 --> 00:41:29.997
Now 31, so to realize...

832
00:41:30.216 --> 00:41:33.288
to have animals to work with and we have

833
00:41:33.288 --> 00:41:35.891
a number of cats and a dog and a horse --

834
00:41:35.891 --> 00:41:37.832
<v Regina>And you've reversed the cancer in them?</v>

835
00:41:37.832 --> 00:41:40.520
<v ->Oh yes, our dog has a bit of a bladder problem</v>

836
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.678
from time to time, and he will start to

837
00:41:43.678 --> 00:41:47.006
leak a little bit, and so we have a number

838
00:41:47.006 --> 00:41:50.120
that Phyllis reads into him and that leakage stops

839
00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.659
for maybe a week or two and every once and a while

840
00:41:52.659 --> 00:41:54.323
she has to read the number back into him

841
00:41:54.323 --> 00:41:56.628
so he has a bit of a weakness in his bladder,

842
00:41:56.628 --> 00:42:00.467
but she can actually help him keep that under control.

843
00:42:00.467 --> 00:42:03.241
Then feline leukemia, we've had a number of cats

844
00:42:03.241 --> 00:42:06.397
come down and become listless and what not

845
00:42:06.397 --> 00:42:10.387
and we basically use the feline leukemia number

846
00:42:10.387 --> 00:42:13.970
and they're back up full stream, so we've never

847
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:16.850
lost a cat and we have 11 of them

848
00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:19.688
that have come to us, the bulk come as strays

849
00:42:19.688 --> 00:42:24.658
and so, and we don't live in a concentrated area

850
00:42:24.658 --> 00:42:28.029
we're a quarter of a mile from our next closest neighbor

851
00:42:28.029 --> 00:42:30.909
so they come across the desert to reach us.

852
00:42:30.909 --> 00:42:34.535
<v Regina>Right. Intuitively they find their way.</v>

853
00:42:34.535 --> 00:42:35.474
<v ->Perhaps.</v>

854
00:42:35.474 --> 00:42:37.714
<v Regina>Instinctively they find their way.</v>

855
00:42:37.714 --> 00:42:39.677
What about a couple of people stories

856
00:42:39.677 --> 00:42:42.621
that are really just amazing because the person

857
00:42:42.621 --> 00:42:44.903
may have been pretty far gone?

858
00:42:44.903 --> 00:42:47.485
<v ->We had a fellow that we were working on in Toronto</v>

859
00:42:47.485 --> 00:42:50.216
and he'd been in the hospital with leukemia,

860
00:42:50.216 --> 00:42:53.138
no not leukemia, cancer, he didn't have leukemia

861
00:42:53.138 --> 00:42:55.506
he had cancer, and

862
00:42:55.506 --> 00:42:59.388
he had had been in and out of the hospital a couple

863
00:42:59.388 --> 00:43:02.247
of times and one day

864
00:43:02.247 --> 00:43:04.850
he'd been in the hospital for several weeks,

865
00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:06.685
maybe two or three weeks.

866
00:43:06.685 --> 00:43:09.692
And basically they're doing their chemo, they're

867
00:43:09.692 --> 00:43:12.232
doing their radiation, and all the rest of it

868
00:43:12.232 --> 00:43:14.855
and I checked our life number and my god

869
00:43:14.855 --> 00:43:17.116
he's about halfway up the list.

870
00:43:17.116 --> 00:43:19.548
<v Regina>You mean he's fairly close to death?</v>

871
00:43:19.548 --> 00:43:21.576
<v ->Yeah, he was basically well on his way.</v>

872
00:43:21.576 --> 00:43:24.392
So I phoned his wife, and I said yeah, you know

873
00:43:24.392 --> 00:43:26.524
we've gotta get busy on Carmen, I said he is

874
00:43:26.524 --> 00:43:29.831
showing signs of moving on.

875
00:43:29.831 --> 00:43:31.559
And she says, yes, he's been in a

876
00:43:31.559 --> 00:43:33.800
unconscious state for several days now

877
00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.484
and the doctors say any hour now

878
00:43:35.484 --> 00:43:36.721
he'll be gone.

879
00:43:36.721 --> 00:43:38.044
I said well here's a number.

880
00:43:38.044 --> 00:43:39.836
Now I developed a number on the spot.

881
00:43:39.836 --> 00:43:43.249
At the time to deal with what his condition was.

882
00:43:43.249 --> 00:43:46.150
I didn't know what it was, but it wasn't cancer.

883
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:49.479
It really was the chemicals from the chemo

884
00:43:49.479 --> 00:43:52.486
were killing him, and so I developed a neutralizing

885
00:43:52.486 --> 00:43:55.515
number to counter what it was that was killing him.

886
00:43:55.515 --> 00:43:57.883
I didn't know what was killing him, I just

887
00:43:57.883 --> 00:43:59.825
was able to say something is killing him

888
00:43:59.825 --> 00:44:01.681
and I got an answer, yes give me a number

889
00:44:01.681 --> 00:44:03.259
to counter that.

890
00:44:03.259 --> 00:44:04.028
And so --

891
00:44:04.028 --> 00:44:06.161
<v Regina>How did you find out that it was a toxic</v>

892
00:44:06.161 --> 00:44:07.974
effect from the chemicals?

893
00:44:07.974 --> 00:44:10.769
<v ->Well I asked afterwards the question,</v>

894
00:44:10.769 --> 00:44:13.137
but at the time I was developing the number I was just

895
00:44:13.137 --> 00:44:15.654
dealing with a condition, which I'm able to do.

896
00:44:15.654 --> 00:44:18.043
I say okay fine, you have a condition.

897
00:44:18.043 --> 00:44:20.283
Is there a number or numbers that will eliminate

898
00:44:20.283 --> 00:44:22.694
that condition, and my rod would say yes.

899
00:44:22.694 --> 00:44:24.208
Okay, give me that number.

900
00:44:24.208 --> 00:44:26.235
So I have no idea what we're eliminating.

901
00:44:26.235 --> 00:44:29.819
So I gave her that number and she sat and read

902
00:44:29.819 --> 00:44:31.867
that number to him probably for the next

903
00:44:31.867 --> 00:44:35.622
day or two, and I phoned her back in about

904
00:44:35.622 --> 00:44:38.480
two or three days, expecting that he had passed on,

905
00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:41.275
and I said, how did Carmen make out?

906
00:44:41.275 --> 00:44:43.899
She says, do you wanna talk to him?

907
00:44:43.899 --> 00:44:46.693
So anyway, I say, yes I'd love to talk to him.

908
00:44:46.693 --> 00:44:50.128
So I say hi Carmen, how you doing?

909
00:44:50.128 --> 00:44:52.625
He said thanks buddy, you did it.

910
00:44:52.625 --> 00:44:54.693
And he's alive today.

911
00:44:54.693 --> 00:44:56.293
<v Regina>Aw, that's wonderful.</v>

912
00:44:56.293 --> 00:44:57.829
<v ->Yeah it's been what, three years ago?</v>

913
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:59.131
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>
<v Lloyd>Yeah.</v>

914
00:44:59.131 --> 00:45:02.138
And so he says there's no other way,

915
00:45:02.138 --> 00:45:04.976
he was on his way out, he was not aware of it

916
00:45:04.976 --> 00:45:07.706
but he says in reviewing the whole thing

917
00:45:07.706 --> 00:45:09.776
he said it was...

918
00:45:09.776 --> 00:45:12.314
my wife, he gives me the credit I say no,

919
00:45:12.314 --> 00:45:14.426
I say your wife did it, it wasn't me.

920
00:45:14.426 --> 00:45:16.560
I just gave her some numbers to work with.

921
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:18.608
<v Regina>And she had the intention you're going to</v>

922
00:45:18.608 --> 00:45:20.315
hang on, you're going to stay alive.

923
00:45:20.315 --> 00:45:22.959
And that obviously in a situation that emotionally

924
00:45:22.959 --> 00:45:25.071
powerful, is a big part of it.

925
00:45:25.071 --> 00:45:27.141
And then you read the refined element of

926
00:45:27.141 --> 00:45:28.954
the numbers along with that and you get

927
00:45:28.954 --> 00:45:30.298
a more powerful effect.

928
00:45:31.788 --> 00:45:34.676
<v ->You know, we don't, it's not an ego trip.</v>

929
00:45:34.676 --> 00:45:36.640
We don't dwell on successes.

930
00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:41.439
We more dwell on challenges, and people come in,

931
00:45:41.439 --> 00:45:44.724
we had a woman very recently who is a healer

932
00:45:44.724 --> 00:45:48.436
in her own right, and she had gone to the doctor

933
00:45:48.436 --> 00:45:51.380
and had run some tests and she had some chromosome

934
00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:54.153
problems and they said you know,

935
00:45:54.153 --> 00:45:56.052
this is where your problem is, but there's nothing

936
00:45:56.052 --> 00:45:57.396
we can do to help you.

937
00:45:57.396 --> 00:45:59.380
She says I know somebody that can.

938
00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:01.876
And so she phoned me up and told me what

939
00:46:01.876 --> 00:46:04.734
her problem was, well come on over and let's get busy.

940
00:46:04.734 --> 00:46:08.126
So she came over and we basically developed

941
00:46:08.126 --> 00:46:10.345
the energy she needed to get her chromosomes

942
00:46:10.345 --> 00:46:12.755
functioning properly, and she's doing fine.

943
00:46:12.755 --> 00:46:15.359
She went back to the doctor here very recently

944
00:46:15.359 --> 00:46:18.110
and the doctor basically said, well your numbers

945
00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:20.777
should be up in this certain range.

946
00:46:20.777 --> 00:46:22.911
And he said, you're way down here

947
00:46:22.911 --> 00:46:24.851
what in the hell did you do?

948
00:46:24.851 --> 00:46:27.704
And she says, we fixed it.

949
00:46:28.415 --> 00:46:31.871
But it's a matter of just understanding the energetic

950
00:46:31.871 --> 00:46:34.323
reality, nevermind putting names on things

951
00:46:34.323 --> 00:46:37.843
be able to measure energy and adjust energy

952
00:46:37.843 --> 00:46:39.891
to keep it in balance.

953
00:46:39.891 --> 00:46:42.003
<v Regina>It makes sense Lloyd when you think back to</v>

954
00:46:42.003 --> 00:46:44.584
the articles and headlines even from the 1930's

955
00:46:44.584 --> 00:46:47.181
even with Roe, Rim, and Rife's work.

956
00:46:47.379 --> 00:46:50.152
Where he had discovered certain frequencies that worked

957
00:46:50.152 --> 00:46:52.606
and was wiping out cancer in the day.

958
00:46:52.606 --> 00:46:54.931
In fact the articles said the end of cancer.

959
00:46:54.931 --> 00:46:58.557
They found the technology, again, based on

960
00:46:58.557 --> 00:47:01.245
these frequencies, these numbers.

961
00:47:01.245 --> 00:47:03.656
So it makes perfect sense, although this is something

962
00:47:03.656 --> 00:47:07.624
that is a little more manageable for individuals

963
00:47:07.624 --> 00:47:09.650
it seems because they can take their numbers home

964
00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:10.930
and do it themselves.

965
00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:14.706
<v ->Yeah, you don't need another practitioner to</v>

966
00:47:14.706 --> 00:47:16.989
treat you in this program.

967
00:47:16.989 --> 00:47:19.784
You and, if you happen to have the manual, or

968
00:47:19.784 --> 00:47:22.088
the number specific, you basically

969
00:47:22.088 --> 00:47:24.264
that is the team.

970
00:47:24.264 --> 00:47:26.270
You and your numbers.

971
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:29.042
And it's a matter of determining what numbers

972
00:47:29.042 --> 00:47:32.178
you're short and what you need to be in balance,

973
00:47:32.178 --> 00:47:34.802
but once that's done, then you have

974
00:47:34.802 --> 00:47:36.210
the tools to work with.

975
00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:39.751
<v Regina>Now can a person divine or whatever,</v>

976
00:47:39.751 --> 00:47:42.967
however, I say divine, their own numbers?

977
00:47:43.037 --> 00:47:47.660
<v ->I've never met anybody yet that was proficient at that.</v>

978
00:47:48.157 --> 00:47:50.482
I've had lots of people try and they come up with

979
00:47:50.482 --> 00:47:52.402
numbers, here check this number, see if it

980
00:47:52.402 --> 00:47:53.831
will do this.

981
00:47:53.831 --> 00:47:58.156
In almost all cases, no, it didn't.

982
00:47:58.162 --> 00:48:00.274
Now I don't know what their train of thought was

983
00:48:00.274 --> 00:48:04.434
when they did it, and why it didn't develop for them

984
00:48:04.434 --> 00:48:07.357
but I've never met anybody yet that was capable

985
00:48:07.357 --> 00:48:10.279
to develop the numbers, although I've shown

986
00:48:10.279 --> 00:48:13.649
them how I do it, and it's a very basic program

987
00:48:13.649 --> 00:48:16.418
that I have, but it

988
00:48:17.212 --> 00:48:19.409
but certainly they can use the numbers, but they've

989
00:48:19.409 --> 00:48:20.497
not been able to develop --

990
00:48:20.497 --> 00:48:22.183
<v Regina>Self diagnoses is a little more difficult</v>

991
00:48:22.183 --> 00:48:24.188
it seems and maybe it's because we have our filters,

992
00:48:24.188 --> 00:48:25.852
belief systems, and so forth that

993
00:48:25.852 --> 00:48:28.263
maybe it doesn't allow us to dispassionately

994
00:48:28.263 --> 00:48:31.121
go in and identify down to that fine

995
00:48:31.121 --> 00:48:33.041
a degree what's going on.

996
00:48:33.041 --> 00:48:35.815
<v ->There's something yet that we have to determine</v>

997
00:48:35.815 --> 00:48:39.115
how to allow that to evolve.

998
00:48:39.462 --> 00:48:42.470
And it may well be that we will figure out,

999
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:44.541
what I am attempting to do of course is to

1000
00:48:44.541 --> 00:48:47.654
put together an organization of people that will

1001
00:48:47.654 --> 00:48:50.854
learn this and carry it to the next level.

1002
00:48:50.854 --> 00:48:53.158
And I'm hoping that somehow rather

1003
00:48:53.158 --> 00:48:56.850
we learn how they can create the sequences

1004
00:48:56.850 --> 00:49:00.683
that are required to take it to the next level.

1005
00:49:00.817 --> 00:49:02.823
I will be there to help them, but I'm not

1006
00:49:02.823 --> 00:49:04.763
the world's best teacher, and I think at

1007
00:49:04.763 --> 00:49:08.219
my age and what not I'm better off spending

1008
00:49:08.219 --> 00:49:10.886
my time and effort at moving,

1009
00:49:10.886 --> 00:49:13.297
helping move the program forward and have others

1010
00:49:13.297 --> 00:49:15.402
teach it and...

1011
00:49:15.686 --> 00:49:18.416
<v Regina>Well as you've said a number of times.</v>

1012
00:49:18.416 --> 00:49:20.550
We need to get to work, so

1013
00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:22.896
hopefully there are people listening and watching

1014
00:49:22.896 --> 00:49:25.072
right now that are resonating with what

1015
00:49:25.072 --> 00:49:27.206
you're saying and, among that and the other

1016
00:49:27.206 --> 00:49:28.976
people you've had contact with, you'll be able

1017
00:49:28.976 --> 00:49:30.768
to build this organization sooner than later

1018
00:49:30.768 --> 00:49:32.924
because we can certainly use all the quantum

1019
00:49:32.924 --> 00:49:34.566
healing we can get.

1020
00:49:34.566 --> 00:49:36.785
<v ->Well it's very effective and very inexpensive</v>

1021
00:49:36.785 --> 00:49:40.560
and with the price of medicine and the price of

1022
00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.843
medical care being what it is,

1023
00:49:42.843 --> 00:49:46.427
we're gonna have to look at some of the alternatives

1024
00:49:46.427 --> 00:49:48.901
so basic stuff can at least be treated

1025
00:49:48.901 --> 00:49:52.145
and the sniffles you don't go to emergency room

1026
00:49:52.145 --> 00:49:56.453
and for a sniffle you basically have a number for silver

1027
00:49:56.453 --> 00:49:59.290
which is antibacterial, or a number for palladium,

1028
00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:02.064
which is antiviral, and you may find by doing

1029
00:50:02.064 --> 00:50:04.581
those two numbers, the sniffle goes away.

1030
00:50:04.581 --> 00:50:08.912
So the opening of people's minds to realize

1031
00:50:08.912 --> 00:50:13.912
that there is a less expensive but an effective way

1032
00:50:14.224 --> 00:50:17.445
of looking after yourself, has to evolve.

1033
00:50:17.445 --> 00:50:19.066
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

1034
00:50:19.066 --> 00:50:22.181
<v ->There just is no economic possibility</v>

1035
00:50:22.181 --> 00:50:25.082
that we can sustain the influx of cost

1036
00:50:25.082 --> 00:50:27.557
as we're seeing in medical and being able to afford

1037
00:50:27.557 --> 00:50:28.987
to be there.

1038
00:50:28.987 --> 00:50:31.269
<v Regina>Absolutely, well I want to thank you so much</v>

1039
00:50:31.269 --> 00:50:33.381
for your contribution and your work,

1040
00:50:33.381 --> 00:50:37.114
and I hope that you gather the people around you

1041
00:50:37.114 --> 00:50:39.056
that you need to take this forward.

1042
00:50:39.056 --> 00:50:40.656
<v ->Well there's many of them out there.</v>

1043
00:50:40.656 --> 00:50:42.767
The biggest problem is it's an economic reality

1044
00:50:42.767 --> 00:50:45.242
and you can't bring people into something like this

1045
00:50:45.242 --> 00:50:47.738
and say you're going to go onto a six month learning

1046
00:50:47.738 --> 00:50:50.639
spree and we're going to develop a program,

1047
00:50:50.639 --> 00:50:53.199
because they'll starve to death at the end of the first

1048
00:50:53.199 --> 00:50:56.527
week unless you have the money to support them

1049
00:50:56.527 --> 00:50:59.387
and the program, so my effort at this time

1050
00:50:59.387 --> 00:51:02.437
is trying to create some means of a financial

1051
00:51:02.437 --> 00:51:05.252
reality so this can happen.

1052
00:51:05.252 --> 00:51:08.772
And we do create income and that will always

1053
00:51:08.772 --> 00:51:10.884
be part of it, but

1054
00:51:10.884 --> 00:51:12.655
anyway, that's --

1055
00:51:12.655 --> 00:51:15.663
<v Regina>Need some kind of seed capital.</v>

1056
00:51:15.663 --> 00:51:17.540
Or you need it to come from somewhere and I guess

1057
00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:19.780
we shouldnt' be closed to how that might show up.

1058
00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:23.237
<v ->Well, we're basically looking and in the meantime</v>

1059
00:51:23.237 --> 00:51:25.455
we're forging ahead.

1060
00:51:25.455 --> 00:51:27.780
<v Regina>Well, Lloyd thank you so much for your time.</v>

1061
00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:29.444
I very much enjoyed this talk.

1062
00:51:29.444 --> 00:51:32.553
<v ->Thanks for taking your time.</v>

1063
00:51:32.644 --> 00:51:35.054
<v ->Lloyd has compiled his eight year study</v>

1064
00:51:35.054 --> 00:51:37.358
containing the specific numeric frequencies

1065
00:51:37.358 --> 00:51:40.004
for various conditions and is now making the book

1066
00:51:40.004 --> 00:51:41.753
available to the public.

1067
00:51:41.753 --> 00:51:44.590
Meanwhile, he, his wife Phyllis, and their dog Wrinkles

1068
00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:46.809
are happy to travel to anyone who wishes

1069
00:51:46.809 --> 00:51:48.388
to put a group together.

1070
00:51:48.388 --> 00:51:50.692
He does his assessment and balancing sessions

1071
00:51:50.692 --> 00:51:53.123
for an extremely reasonable fee.

1072
00:51:53.123 --> 00:51:55.471
You can contact Lloyd at the link below.

1073
00:51:55.471 --> 00:51:58.408
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1074
00:51:59.758 --> 00:52:03.571
