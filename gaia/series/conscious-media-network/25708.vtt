00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.216
(calm music)

2
00:00:13.154 --> 00:00:15.362
<v ->This is in my opinion one of the most important</v>

3
00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:17.634
topics of modern history, the collapse

4
00:00:17.634 --> 00:00:19.676
of the World Trade Center buildings.

5
00:00:19.938 --> 00:00:22.093
Wars have been fought, lives have been lost,

6
00:00:22.093 --> 00:00:23.575
and nations have been brought to the brink

7
00:00:23.575 --> 00:00:26.412
of bankruptcy while a handful of corporations

8
00:00:26.412 --> 00:00:29.292
have become very wealthy as a result of those buildings

9
00:00:29.292 --> 00:00:30.470
coming down.

10
00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:32.919
The question is, who stood to gain

11
00:00:32.919 --> 00:00:34.118
in their destruction?

12
00:00:34.465 --> 00:00:36.140
Richard Gage is the head of architects

13
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.465
and engineers for 9/11 truth.

14
00:00:38.465 --> 00:00:39.947
There should not be a shred of doubt

15
00:00:39.947 --> 00:00:41.857
in anyone's mind after hearing him out

16
00:00:41.857 --> 00:00:43.734
that all three buildings were taken

17
00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:45.888
down in a controlled demolition,

18
00:00:45.888 --> 00:00:47.776
which means the last decade of war

19
00:00:47.776 --> 00:00:49.771
and the loss of lives and liberty

20
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:51.183
was based on a lie.

21
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:53.184
A crime almost too hanous

22
00:00:53.184 --> 00:00:54.405
to consider.

23
00:00:55.904 --> 00:01:00.904 line:15% 
(calm music)

24
00:01:05.077 --> 00:01:07.114
Richard, I've been wanting to talk to you for awhile,

25
00:01:07.114 --> 00:01:09.439
but I have to say that each time I thought

26
00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.530
about this subject, I almost fell

27
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.804
into this almost kind of a depressive

28
00:01:14.804 --> 00:01:16.681
state of mind as almost,

29
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:18.046
why bother?

30
00:01:18.046 --> 00:01:20.233
It's been almost 10 years and what's

31
00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:23.251
so obvious is being completely ignored.

32
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:25.203
What's another interview going to do?

33
00:01:25.203 --> 00:01:27.038
But I don't feel that way anymore.

34
00:01:27.038 --> 00:01:28.542
<v ->Good.</v>

35
00:01:28.542 --> 00:01:30.259
<v Woman>I'm feeling like it's our duty</v>

36
00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.030
to pick this one up, and

37
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.237
you and I were talking off camera a moment ago,

38
00:01:34.237 --> 00:01:37.736
and apparently Geraldo Rivera just a few days ago

39
00:01:37.736 --> 00:01:40.274
picked up on it, and has aired.

40
00:01:40.274 --> 00:01:42.728
Tell us what he actually aired in that show,

41
00:01:42.728 --> 00:01:44.423
because this is big, because it's on

42
00:01:44.423 --> 00:01:46.444
mainstream media.

43
00:01:46.444 --> 00:01:50.002
<v ->Yes, well Geraldo had one of our petition signers,</v>

44
00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:52.231
Tony Zambondium, a chemical engineer

45
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:55.527
on for eight minutes with Bob Micklevein,

46
00:01:55.527 --> 00:01:57.596
a family member who lost his son Bobby

47
00:01:57.596 --> 00:02:00.988
in what was an explosion,

48
00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:03.710
but which was denied and he was lied to about it.

49
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.590
Geraldo Rivera at Geraldo At Large

50
00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.563
for the first time in God knows

51
00:02:13.563 --> 00:02:15.904
how many years, as you're suggesting,

52
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.229
had 9/11 truth

53
00:02:19.877 --> 00:02:22.218
positively displayed.

54
00:02:22.714 --> 00:02:25.968
He acknowledged that he might be wrong about

55
00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.591
the at least building seven,

56
00:02:30.895 --> 00:02:35.492
which he acknowledged about four times

57
00:02:35.492 --> 00:02:37.977
that 1,300 architects and engineers

58
00:02:37.977 --> 00:02:40.068
calling for a new investigation.

59
00:02:40.068 --> 00:02:41.231
<v Woman>Good.</v>
<v ->Based on</v>

60
00:02:41.231 --> 00:02:42.809
it's free fall descent, the information

61
00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:44.825
we're gonna be talking about today.

62
00:02:44.825 --> 00:02:46.590
It is just

63
00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:49.497
a breath of fresh air to say the least,

64
00:02:49.497 --> 00:02:52.697
if not stunning to see the mainstream media,

65
00:02:52.697 --> 00:02:55.992
Fox News in particular, pick up this story,

66
00:02:55.992 --> 00:02:59.079
and basically run with it.

67
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.957
Not try to turn it into some kind of a hit piece.

68
00:03:02.957 --> 00:03:04.845
This was really good.

69
00:03:04.845 --> 00:03:07.213
We're all kind of in the 9/11 truth movement

70
00:03:07.213 --> 00:03:09.645
wondering what are they up to?

71
00:03:09.645 --> 00:03:10.903
<v Woman>I know, immediately you can't help</v>

72
00:03:10.903 --> 00:03:12.343
but think, why now?

73
00:03:12.343 --> 00:03:14.711
This information has been available for many,

74
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:15.959
many years now.

75
00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.702
Why now?

76
00:03:17.702 --> 00:03:18.338
But let's not go there.

77
00:03:18.338 --> 00:03:21.356
Let's be jubilant that at least something has made it out

78
00:03:21.356 --> 00:03:24.652
to the public awareness, because so far

79
00:03:24.652 --> 00:03:26.486
people like you have been viewed

80
00:03:26.486 --> 00:03:27.830
marginalized to say the least,

81
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.665
but viewed almost as wingnuts.

82
00:03:29.665 --> 00:03:31.233
Oh, right, you know,

83
00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:32.929
and the conspiracy nets

84
00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:34.881
by mainstream media, and you're anything but.

85
00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:38.272
We're talking about guys who are basically

86
00:03:38.272 --> 00:03:40.960
engineers and architects, and women.

87
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.651
1,300 of you, who all have come to the same

88
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:47.413
conclusion that it's absolutely impossible

89
00:03:47.413 --> 00:03:48.810
that those buildings came down

90
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.221
as a result of impact that led to fire,

91
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:53.247
that led to the total destruction and collapse

92
00:03:53.247 --> 00:03:54.383
of these buildings.

93
00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:56.116
<v ->All three of the buildings, too.</v>

94
00:03:56.116 --> 00:03:57.668
<v Woman>All three, exactly.</v>

95
00:03:57.668 --> 00:03:59.524
<v ->It is extraordinary.</v>

96
00:03:59.524 --> 00:04:00.527
<v Woman>Why don't we just start with</v>

97
00:04:00.527 --> 00:04:02.681
building seven, because that's an easy mark.

98
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:06.649
Easy mark starting with the fact that a BBC commentator

99
00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:09.582
said and building seven has come down

100
00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.598
20 minutes before the building came down.

101
00:04:11.598 --> 00:04:14.734
In this we're talking about advance

102
00:04:14.734 --> 00:04:17.283
notification, and there are other instances of

103
00:04:17.283 --> 00:04:20.120
advanced notification down on the street

104
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.307
too that happened prior to the building coming down.

105
00:04:22.307 --> 00:04:24.973
Can you just talk a little bit about that part?

106
00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:26.808
<v ->Yes, well first of all,</v>

107
00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:29.922
I've been an architect for 20 years,

108
00:04:29.922 --> 00:04:31.911
practiced in

109
00:04:34.285 --> 00:04:38.129
large steel framed fire proofed buildings.

110
00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:40.876
The last project I worked on was 400 million

111
00:04:40.876 --> 00:04:44.646
dollars with 1,200 tons of steel in it

112
00:04:45.025 --> 00:04:46.391
in Nevada.

113
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:47.686
This project went,

114
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.374
forget that.

115
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.212
Four years ago, I became aware of

116
00:04:55.212 --> 00:05:00.212
the 9/11 issue when I heard David Ray Griffin

117
00:05:00.257 --> 00:05:02.528
on the radio talking about these

118
00:05:02.528 --> 00:05:04.662
sounds of explosions heard by

119
00:05:04.662 --> 00:05:08.491
these 118 witnesses that was recorded

120
00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:13.088
by the city chief fire commissioner, Thomas Fonesem.

121
00:05:14.598 --> 00:05:16.053
118 of these

122
00:05:16.053 --> 00:05:18.655
witnesses, first responders were talking

123
00:05:18.655 --> 00:05:20.415
about sounds of explosions,

124
00:05:20.415 --> 00:05:22.506
seeing flashes of light at the onset

125
00:05:22.506 --> 00:05:25.151
of the destruction of the twin towers.

126
00:05:25.151 --> 00:05:27.278
I'm going

127
00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:29.705
wait a minute, I didn't know anything about this.

128
00:05:29.705 --> 00:05:30.815
<v Woman>Let me ask you, had you seen loose</v>

129
00:05:30.815 --> 00:05:32.212
change at that point or anything,

130
00:05:32.212 --> 00:05:34.142
or this was all fresh to you?

131
00:05:34.142 --> 00:05:35.209
<v ->All fresh.</v>

132
00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:38.110
I was on my way to a construction site observation,

133
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.361
and this just floored me.

134
00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:43.475
David Ray Griffin, he doesn't sound like a

135
00:05:43.475 --> 00:05:44.819
conspiracy theorist.

136
00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:45.566
<v Woman>No not at all.</v>

137
00:05:45.566 --> 00:05:46.888
<v ->He's very believable.
<v Woman>Very respected, yes.</v>

138
00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:51.251
<v ->Old, elderly gentlemen, a theologian at that.</v>

139
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:53.453
He had no acts to grind, right?

140
00:05:53.715 --> 00:05:56.445
I'm going this can't be true,

141
00:05:56.445 --> 00:06:00.541
but he gave a whole bunch of evidence

142
00:06:00.541 --> 00:06:02.301
that we'll be talking about today,

143
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:05.106
and it all sounded reasonable

144
00:06:05.106 --> 00:06:07.474
in terms of it didn't match the official story.

145
00:06:07.474 --> 00:06:09.682
It didn't match my perception of what I thought

146
00:06:09.682 --> 00:06:11.793
I knew about the destruction of these

147
00:06:11.793 --> 00:06:15.025
three high rises, but I checked it out,

148
00:06:15.025 --> 00:06:18.140
and I just felt like the ground

149
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.822
gave way from under me.

150
00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:24.523
I was just

151
00:06:24.806 --> 00:06:26.523
just stunned.

152
00:06:26.523 --> 00:06:28.059
<v Woman>Talk about that for a moment.</v>

153
00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:30.054
From someone who knew nothing

154
00:06:30.054 --> 00:06:33.584
only moments before and accepted the officials story

155
00:06:33.584 --> 00:06:35.533
to that moment, what were some of the thoughts

156
00:06:35.533 --> 00:06:37.106
going through your head?

157
00:06:37.506 --> 00:06:39.021
<v ->It can't be true.</v>

158
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:41.617
I would have heard about it by now.

159
00:06:41.783 --> 00:06:43.495
Somebody would have talked.

160
00:06:43.597 --> 00:06:45.826
All of the questions that I get as a

161
00:06:45.826 --> 00:06:50.758
speaker with in the question and answer session, and

162
00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:57.316
I guess I was speechless for days,

163
00:06:57.316 --> 00:06:59.737
but I mean, I talked to people who knew

164
00:06:59.737 --> 00:07:00.761
about these things,

165
00:07:00.761 --> 00:07:04.211
and I was just feeling incredulous, you know?

166
00:07:04.377 --> 00:07:05.657
<v Woman>Let me ask you a question at this point.</v>

167
00:07:05.657 --> 00:07:07.353
When you saw the film of these buildings,

168
00:07:07.353 --> 00:07:10.691
millions of people thought geez,

169
00:07:10.691 --> 00:07:12.387
and it was even said by the anchors

170
00:07:12.387 --> 00:07:15.053
that were live at the time the first hour or two,

171
00:07:15.053 --> 00:07:17.357
looks like a controlled demolition these buildings

172
00:07:17.357 --> 00:07:18.631
coming down.

173
00:07:18.755 --> 00:07:20.120
Did that occur to you when you were watching

174
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.517
the original video?

175
00:07:21.517 --> 00:07:24.135
<v ->I'm quite embarrassed to suggest that it didn't.</v>

176
00:07:24.162 --> 00:07:25.410
<v Woman>Oh.</v>

177
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.407
<v ->I never seen, I've seen a controlled demolition.</v>

178
00:07:29.777 --> 00:07:32.644
Building seven looks like a controlled demolition.

179
00:07:32.644 --> 00:07:34.675
I didn't see building seven

180
00:07:34.756 --> 00:07:36.350
on 9/11.

181
00:07:36.398 --> 00:07:38.308
All I saw was the Twin Towers coming down.

182
00:07:38.308 --> 00:07:39.236
<v Woman>Yes, okay.</v>

183
00:07:39.236 --> 00:07:41.411
<v ->And we were told that was a gravitational collapse.</v>

184
00:07:41.411 --> 00:07:43.043
We had never seen one.

185
00:07:43.043 --> 00:07:45.667
We'd never seen an airplane hit a building like that.

186
00:07:45.667 --> 00:07:47.566
What could happen.

187
00:07:47.566 --> 00:07:51.075
We were ready to accept the explanation

188
00:07:51.075 --> 00:07:54.979
of the experts who had pre-prepared explanations

189
00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:56.786
for us, and

190
00:07:57.837 --> 00:08:00.226
we were in a state of shock as well.

191
00:08:00.226 --> 00:08:02.498
I mean, on 9/11, in the morning I'm just going

192
00:08:02.498 --> 00:08:04.215
what am I looking at?

193
00:08:04.215 --> 00:08:06.609
It's not

194
00:08:07.725 --> 00:08:10.807
it's not something I've ever experienced before,

195
00:08:10.807 --> 00:08:12.732
shock like that.

196
00:08:13.324 --> 00:08:16.108
In that state, we tend to want answers

197
00:08:16.108 --> 00:08:19.638
to these painful questions that we're

198
00:08:19.638 --> 00:08:21.953
immediately accosted with,

199
00:08:21.953 --> 00:08:24.299
and so we accept them.

200
00:08:24.299 --> 00:08:27.201
The architecture and engineering communities largely

201
00:08:27.201 --> 00:08:28.592
accepted these.

202
00:08:28.993 --> 00:08:32.363
Four years later, when I heard

203
00:08:32.363 --> 00:08:36.229
this other evidence which was not in the official reports,

204
00:08:36.768 --> 00:08:39.157
which we're gonna be talking about today.

205
00:08:39.157 --> 00:08:41.359
I assembled it.

206
00:08:41.365 --> 00:08:44.085
Within a couple of months, I took it to the firm

207
00:08:44.085 --> 00:08:45.593
I worked for.

208
00:08:45.781 --> 00:08:48.010
We have 15 architects and engineers there.

209
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.909
They thought I was nuts, because I was talking

210
00:08:49.909 --> 00:08:51.402
to them about this.

211
00:08:51.402 --> 00:08:53.418
After they came and watched the presentation

212
00:08:53.418 --> 00:08:56.180
at lunch, I had to bribe them with pizza

213
00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.966
to get them there.

214
00:08:57.993 --> 00:09:00.319
They all agreed

215
00:09:00.319 --> 00:09:01.539
with me.

216
00:09:01.705 --> 00:09:04.169
All of them that these are controlled demolitions,

217
00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:06.142
that they didn't know about this evidence.

218
00:09:06.142 --> 00:09:07.326
Why didn't they know?

219
00:09:07.326 --> 00:09:08.553
And then they began to feel like

220
00:09:08.553 --> 00:09:11.390
I felt shocked, floored

221
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.992
hearing this evidence.

222
00:09:13.992 --> 00:09:16.200
14 of them signed our petition.

223
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.355
That was our first petition signers

224
00:09:18.355 --> 00:09:22.114
back at that firm, about four years ago.

225
00:09:22.163 --> 00:09:26.600
Since then it's just been building gradually.

226
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:31.570
We now have over 1,350 architects and engineers

227
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:34.311
signed on, demanding a new investigation.

228
00:09:34.311 --> 00:09:36.423
<v Woman>And that's from 30 of the states in the US</v>

229
00:09:36.423 --> 00:09:38.140
and also a few other countries.

230
00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.830
<v ->Yes,</v>

231
00:09:40.156 --> 00:09:42.567
I don't know the total number of countries,

232
00:09:42.567 --> 00:09:44.241
but it's substantial.

233
00:09:44.241 --> 00:09:45.340
<v Woman>It's substantial.</v>

234
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.057
<v ->Yeah, there's 20 or 30 at least.</v>

235
00:09:47.057 --> 00:09:50.907
<v Woman>Okay, thank you for that background,</v>

236
00:09:50.907 --> 00:09:54.246
and let's now go to some of the evidence

237
00:09:54.246 --> 00:09:56.688
that we're talking about, because really

238
00:09:58.736 --> 00:10:00.682
you can't ignore the evidence.

239
00:10:01.083 --> 00:10:03.141
Well, you could try to ignore the evidence,

240
00:10:03.141 --> 00:10:04.933
but it's very difficult to ignore the evidence,

241
00:10:04.933 --> 00:10:08.741
and if one understands that this may be true,

242
00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:10.693
then it has much larger implications which

243
00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:12.367
we will not get into, because that's

244
00:10:12.367 --> 00:10:14.703
not our job today.

245
00:10:14.703 --> 00:10:16.393
It's to get into the evidence.

246
00:10:16.708 --> 00:10:20.399
Let's talk about building seven again,

247
00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:22.020
because that one is the most obvious

248
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.577
once you take a look at the film and such

249
00:10:23.577 --> 00:10:25.758
that this is a controlled demolition,

250
00:10:25.903 --> 00:10:27.385
and we've seen bits and pieces

251
00:10:27.385 --> 00:10:29.566
that have made it into other films

252
00:10:29.614 --> 00:10:32.611
where there were the early responders

253
00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:33.635
talking about it,

254
00:10:33.635 --> 00:10:34.958
and then again I mentioned earlier,

255
00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.326
BBC announcing its

256
00:10:38.211 --> 00:10:40.280
the building, not demolition,

257
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.253
but the building collapse prior to it even happening.

258
00:10:42.253 --> 00:10:44.199
That's impossible.

259
00:10:45.622 --> 00:10:48.028
Let's talk a little bit about building seven.

260
00:10:49.329 --> 00:10:50.620
<v ->This building</v>

261
00:10:51.021 --> 00:10:54.060
would be the highest building in most of our states.

262
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.223
It's huge.

263
00:10:55.223 --> 00:10:57.880
It has a floor plan

264
00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.524
that's about an acre in size,

265
00:11:00.524 --> 00:11:03.724
and 47 stories tall.

266
00:11:03.724 --> 00:11:06.956
It was only smaller as a result

267
00:11:06.956 --> 00:11:09.304
of its perceived smaller as a result of it's

268
00:11:09.304 --> 00:11:12.792
adjacency to the tallest buildings in the world,

269
00:11:12.792 --> 00:11:15.160
but this was a building that was not

270
00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.733
hit by an airplane.

271
00:11:16.781 --> 00:11:20.482
It doesn't have the excuses

272
00:11:20.482 --> 00:11:22.285
if you will, the jet fuel

273
00:11:22.285 --> 00:11:23.661
and the plane impacts.

274
00:11:23.661 --> 00:11:27.767
It's a fine example, a case study here,

275
00:11:27.767 --> 00:11:28.631
what happens to it.

276
00:11:28.631 --> 00:11:32.780
At 5:20 in the afternoon, it begins

277
00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:36.684
a sudden precipitous smooth

278
00:11:36.684 --> 00:11:40.609
collapse straight down into it's own footprint,

279
00:11:40.609 --> 00:11:43.371
and at free fall acceleration,

280
00:11:43.371 --> 00:11:46.849
free fall in the first two and a half seconds

281
00:11:46.849 --> 00:11:48.912
of it's collapse.

282
00:11:50.827 --> 00:11:53.579
This building is dropping as fast

283
00:11:53.579 --> 00:11:55.642
as a bowling ball would drop.

284
00:11:55.755 --> 00:11:57.803
<v Woman>From the roof, right.</v>

285
00:11:57.803 --> 00:11:59.267
<v ->Yeah,</v>

286
00:11:59.267 --> 00:12:02.146
if the bowling ball has no resistance,

287
00:12:02.146 --> 00:12:03.362
say of air,

288
00:12:03.362 --> 00:12:06.002
and so

289
00:12:06.839 --> 00:12:08.887
how can the building fall that fast?

290
00:12:08.887 --> 00:12:11.767
It means it also has no

291
00:12:11.767 --> 00:12:13.062
resistance.

292
00:12:13.282 --> 00:12:15.212
Now there was an official report put out

293
00:12:15.212 --> 00:12:18.662
on this building, came out seven years later,

294
00:12:18.764 --> 00:12:21.190
and it states.

295
00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:26.139
NIST, the National Institute for Standards and Technology

296
00:12:26.139 --> 00:12:28.881
put out this report

297
00:12:28.881 --> 00:12:32.315
initially stating that it didn't fall at free fall.

298
00:12:32.315 --> 00:12:34.662
If it fell at free fall, that would

299
00:12:34.662 --> 00:12:36.767
mean there would be no structure under it.

300
00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.952
Well, after being cornered by members

301
00:12:39.952 --> 00:12:43.434
of AE 9/11 truth, they

302
00:12:43.738 --> 00:12:45.647
finally acknowledged oh you're right

303
00:12:45.647 --> 00:12:49.167
it did fall at free fall for this two and a half second,

304
00:12:49.167 --> 00:12:51.354
they say two and a quarter second period.

305
00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:53.860
That's eight stories, 100 feet.

306
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.834
In other words, for 100 feet of this building's

307
00:12:55.834 --> 00:12:58.297
it's unresisted.

308
00:12:58.297 --> 00:13:02.126
That means every column on every floor

309
00:13:02.126 --> 00:13:05.102
for at least eight floors had to have been

310
00:13:05.102 --> 00:13:08.398
somehow magically removed.

311
00:13:08.398 --> 00:13:11.043
Now fire, the official cause of this building's

312
00:13:11.043 --> 00:13:15.267
collapse can't remove every column on every floor

313
00:13:15.267 --> 00:13:20.050
for eight floors simultaneously.

314
00:13:20.077 --> 00:13:21.752
These columns have to be removed

315
00:13:21.752 --> 00:13:23.512
within a fraction of a second of each other.

316
00:13:23.512 --> 00:13:25.464
Any deviation in that pattern, and the building

317
00:13:25.464 --> 00:13:28.738
will begin to tip, and this is an exact science.

318
00:13:28.738 --> 00:13:31.938
There are plenty examples of

319
00:13:31.938 --> 00:13:35.004
failed controlled demolitions.

320
00:13:35.404 --> 00:13:39.174
Is fire capable of that level of precision?

321
00:13:39.415 --> 00:13:41.900
No, fire is an organic process

322
00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.067
that moves through the building every 20 minutes

323
00:13:44.067 --> 00:13:45.785
or so, using up the fuel in that area,

324
00:13:45.785 --> 00:13:48.291
moving on looking for fresh new fuel sources.

325
00:13:48.291 --> 00:13:51.192
When a building does collapse due to fire, we have large

326
00:13:51.192 --> 00:13:53.773
gradual deformations.

327
00:13:53.773 --> 00:13:56.045
The building will fall to the path

328
00:13:56.045 --> 00:13:57.282
of least resistance.

329
00:13:57.282 --> 00:14:01.592
It'll fall over, and yet never before

330
00:14:01.592 --> 00:14:04.802
in history has a steel frame or concrete frame

331
00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:08.567
high rise building collapsed due to fire.

332
00:14:08.567 --> 00:14:11.159
<v Woman>And then, as I recall watching the documentary</v>

333
00:14:11.159 --> 00:14:13.228
that you did, the presentation you did,

334
00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:17.335
office fires generally in the forensics tend to run around

335
00:14:17.335 --> 00:14:18.412
1,200 degrees.

336
00:14:18.412 --> 00:14:19.894
I mean is that kind of average 12 to 1,500

337
00:14:19.894 --> 00:14:22.241
degrees for your standard office fire?

338
00:14:22.241 --> 00:14:23.350
<v ->The 600 to</v>

339
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.865
1,500 degrees.
<v Woman>600 to 1,500,</v>

340
00:14:24.865 --> 00:14:27.531
and we're talking melting steel.

341
00:14:27.531 --> 00:14:32.034
<v ->Well, let's clarify that concept,</v>

342
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.370
because it's very important.

343
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:35.500
There's a lot of misunderstanding here.

344
00:14:37.392 --> 00:14:41.106
Steel does not need to melt in order to weaken.

345
00:14:41.106 --> 00:14:43.634
It can weaken at half of it's temperature.

346
00:14:43.634 --> 00:14:46.450
It can weaken to half of it's strength

347
00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:48.444
at about 1,200 degrees.

348
00:14:48.444 --> 00:14:53.137
The fires don't, the steel doesn't get that hot

349
00:14:53.137 --> 00:14:54.246
in these fires.

350
00:14:54.246 --> 00:14:55.894
It's generally fire proofed.

351
00:14:58.174 --> 00:15:03.174
We have no reason for building sevens steel to

352
00:15:06.243 --> 00:15:07.874
get that hot, because it is fire proofed,

353
00:15:07.874 --> 00:15:10.242
and these were very isolated fires.

354
00:15:10.242 --> 00:15:12.791
There's only eight to 10

355
00:15:12.791 --> 00:15:15.650
fires in this building, but the photos

356
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.114
and videos show them to be small and scattered.

357
00:15:18.114 --> 00:15:20.642
Nist claims that the building

358
00:15:20.642 --> 00:15:22.498
was engulfed in fire, and there's no evidence

359
00:15:22.498 --> 00:15:23.993
for that whatsoever.

360
00:15:23.993 --> 00:15:28.057
In fact, the fires were out

361
00:15:28.057 --> 00:15:28.846
fly,

362
00:15:28.846 --> 00:15:32.003
in fact the fires were out in the

363
00:15:32.003 --> 00:15:34.278
area where the initiation of collapse

364
00:15:34.278 --> 00:15:35.931
was said to have begun

365
00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:40.821
about an hour before the collapse began at 5:20.

366
00:15:41.944 --> 00:15:44.355
That pulls the rug out from the official's story

367
00:15:44.355 --> 00:15:45.586
right there.

368
00:15:46.797 --> 00:15:50.050
NIST claims that this raging fire

369
00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:53.207
in the Northeast section around column 79

370
00:15:53.207 --> 00:15:58.199
weakened, well expanded the 50 foot long

371
00:15:58.199 --> 00:16:02.348
steel beams, pushing the gurder off of it's seat

372
00:16:02.348 --> 00:16:04.417
on column 79.

373
00:16:04.417 --> 00:16:08.065
That caused the floors to successively fail, about

374
00:16:08.065 --> 00:16:11.126
10 second before the overall collapse,

375
00:16:11.126 --> 00:16:13.611
and then as these floors failed,

376
00:16:13.611 --> 00:16:15.702
that column then buckled,

377
00:16:15.702 --> 00:16:19.115
column 79, causing the internal cascading

378
00:16:19.115 --> 00:16:22.998
failure inside the building for 10 seconds,

379
00:16:22.998 --> 00:16:26.453
and then the overall building comes down,

380
00:16:26.453 --> 00:16:29.888
and that succession of failures is impossible

381
00:16:29.888 --> 00:16:31.812
for a whole number of reasons.

382
00:16:32.373 --> 00:16:34.479
One, the

383
00:16:37.535 --> 00:16:39.925
the fires couldn't have gotten that hot on the steel

384
00:16:39.925 --> 00:16:41.476
because the

385
00:16:41.972 --> 00:16:43.924
they're fire proofed.

386
00:16:43.924 --> 00:16:47.177
Two, the steel couldn't have expanded,

387
00:16:47.177 --> 00:16:50.559
because they're fire proofed, and they're tied

388
00:16:50.559 --> 00:16:52.585
intimately to the concrete up above.

389
00:16:52.585 --> 00:16:55.412
Three, it couldn't have pushed the girder off of it's seat,

390
00:16:55.412 --> 00:16:57.459
because those girders always have sheer studs

391
00:16:57.459 --> 00:16:59.390
despite the claims of Nist,

392
00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:02.050
and four, even

393
00:17:02.515 --> 00:17:05.512
it wouldn't have caused a collapse

394
00:17:05.512 --> 00:17:06.530
of the

395
00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:09.885
successive failures of these floors,

396
00:17:09.885 --> 00:17:11.837
because of this very redundant,

397
00:17:11.837 --> 00:17:15.880
redundantly designed connections throughout this building,

398
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.567
and even if it had, we wouldn't have had

399
00:17:18.567 --> 00:17:23.297
this incredibly quick, 10 second lateral

400
00:17:23.655 --> 00:17:25.628
migration of failures,

401
00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:28.903
horizontally and vertically throughout the inside

402
00:17:28.903 --> 00:17:29.767
of the building,

403
00:17:29.767 --> 00:17:32.060
and five, if that would have happened, you would of

404
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.033
had large deformations in the

405
00:17:34.033 --> 00:17:35.910
perimeter structure, which we would have seen

406
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:37.183
in the videos,
<v Woman>Makes total sense.</v>

407
00:17:37.183 --> 00:17:38.036
<v ->Which we don't.</v>

408
00:17:38.036 --> 00:17:40.148
None of those things make sense,

409
00:17:40.148 --> 00:17:42.371
from beginning to end.

410
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.606
Then you have a complete failure,

411
00:17:44.606 --> 00:17:46.953
starting with the penthouse up above,

412
00:17:46.953 --> 00:17:48.435
which indicates core column,

413
00:17:48.435 --> 00:17:51.827
and uniform core column through all 24 core column

414
00:17:51.827 --> 00:17:53.224
failure.

415
00:17:53.224 --> 00:17:56.989
One second prior to the overall collapse

416
00:17:56.989 --> 00:17:58.231
of this building.

417
00:17:59.005 --> 00:18:00.818
No, it had to have been controlled

418
00:18:00.818 --> 00:18:04.392
demolitions, and we have in the debris

419
00:18:04.392 --> 00:18:07.506
pile the evidence of incendiaries.

420
00:18:07.506 --> 00:18:09.479
Now why would they use incendiaries?

421
00:18:09.479 --> 00:18:12.124
Incendiaries don't have the large bang

422
00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:15.303
of high energy explosives like C4 and RDX.

423
00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:17.649
Normally used in controlled demolitions.

424
00:18:17.649 --> 00:18:19.487
They don't have the bright flashes.

425
00:18:19.487 --> 00:18:23.476
If they were going to perform a deceptive

426
00:18:23.476 --> 00:18:26.563
controlled demolition, then

427
00:18:27.145 --> 00:18:30.537
you'd expect them to find some alternate

428
00:18:30.537 --> 00:18:32.809
means that wouldn't be such a dead giveaway

429
00:18:32.809 --> 00:18:34.360
of what they were up to.

430
00:18:34.526 --> 00:18:35.944
Thorough might incendiaries

431
00:18:35.944 --> 00:18:38.984
the problem with them though is

432
00:18:38.984 --> 00:18:43.123
they produce several tons of molt and iron,

433
00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:46.163
and that's what we had in the World Trade Center dust.

434
00:18:46.163 --> 00:18:49.853
This is in part documented by FEMA in their

435
00:18:49.853 --> 00:18:52.157
May of 2002 report.

436
00:18:52.157 --> 00:18:55.239
In appendix C they document the only

437
00:18:55.239 --> 00:18:57.906
piece of steel that was saved

438
00:18:57.906 --> 00:19:00.071
from World Trade Center seven,

439
00:19:00.071 --> 00:19:01.212
this girder.

440
00:19:01.212 --> 00:19:04.924
All the rest having been shipped to China for recycling,

441
00:19:04.924 --> 00:19:07.175
which is the illegal destruction of evidence,

442
00:19:07.175 --> 00:19:11.121
even before the report came out in May of 2002,

443
00:19:11.121 --> 00:19:13.052
but this one piece shows,

444
00:19:13.052 --> 00:19:16.326
they say evidence of inter granular melting.

445
00:19:16.326 --> 00:19:18.694
They're documenting the melting of steel.

446
00:19:18.694 --> 00:19:23.611
While steel can fail without melting,

447
00:19:23.611 --> 00:19:26.768
and while the official reports say there's no melting

448
00:19:26.768 --> 00:19:28.283
of steel, the problem is that there's

449
00:19:28.283 --> 00:19:30.042
lots of melting of steel.

450
00:19:30.042 --> 00:19:31.440
It's documented by FEMA.

451
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:36.440
Hot sulfidation of the steel, intergranular melting,

452
00:19:36.527 --> 00:19:40.164
and rapid oxidation, and even evaporation

453
00:19:40.164 --> 00:19:42.564
of the ends of the beams.

454
00:19:42.564 --> 00:19:44.346
Now none of that fire can produce,

455
00:19:44.346 --> 00:19:47.321
by the way, jet fuel can't produce it either,

456
00:19:47.321 --> 00:19:50.148
even though we don't have jet fuel in building seven.

457
00:19:52.168 --> 00:19:55.684
The first responders find molten steel

458
00:19:55.684 --> 00:19:58.211
they called it, flowing like lava.

459
00:19:58.211 --> 00:20:00.558
Chemical analysis by others,

460
00:20:00.558 --> 00:20:03.374
including Steven Jones, physicist,

461
00:20:03.374 --> 00:20:05.646
a physics professor normally associated with

462
00:20:05.646 --> 00:20:10.646
Steven Jones, a physics professor, formally with

463
00:20:11.384 --> 00:20:12.749
Bringenyoung University.

464
00:20:12.749 --> 00:20:15.309
He finds that this is molten iron.

465
00:20:15.309 --> 00:20:20.309
This is underneath all three World Trade Center towers.

466
00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:24.898
In the case of the, underneath all three sky scrapers.

467
00:20:24.898 --> 00:20:27.266
In the case of the towers,

468
00:20:27.266 --> 00:20:29.751
this substance is actually

469
00:20:29.751 --> 00:20:32.673
seen pouring out of the south tower

470
00:20:32.673 --> 00:20:35.233
about 10 minutes prior to the collapse.

471
00:20:35.233 --> 00:20:37.206
<v Woman>And many of the first responders talked</v>

472
00:20:37.206 --> 00:20:41.227
about this before the official story

473
00:20:41.227 --> 00:20:44.107
was made clear to the reporters

474
00:20:44.107 --> 00:20:45.910
and to the news anchors, which, and then,

475
00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:48.651
which case all this disappeared within the first day.

476
00:20:48.651 --> 00:20:49.675
<v ->Yeah, it's a problem.</v>

477
00:20:49.675 --> 00:20:51.115
It not only disappeared from

478
00:20:51.115 --> 00:20:53.152
the stories after the first day.

479
00:20:53.152 --> 00:20:54.965
It disappeared from the record

480
00:20:54.965 --> 00:20:57.642
saved as appendix C which we just talked about.

481
00:20:57.642 --> 00:20:59.125
<v ->Yes, and you're again going back just to</v>

482
00:20:59.125 --> 00:21:01.471
basic temperatures, office fires,

483
00:21:01.471 --> 00:21:03.146
600 to 1,500 degrees.

484
00:21:03.146 --> 00:21:06.644
Molten steel, at least 2,700 and above, right?

485
00:21:06.644 --> 00:21:08.575
<v ->Yeah, and as in this case,</v>

486
00:21:08.575 --> 00:21:10.708
molten iron, which was used apparently

487
00:21:10.708 --> 00:21:13.407
to attack the steel structure.

488
00:21:13.407 --> 00:21:15.028
There's some molten steel here and there,

489
00:21:15.028 --> 00:21:17.214
but largely this turns out to be molten iron.

490
00:21:17.214 --> 00:21:18.793
Molten iron is not,

491
00:21:18.793 --> 00:21:21.811
iron is not used in steel structures.

492
00:21:21.811 --> 00:21:23.454
Hasn't been for about 100 years,

493
00:21:23.454 --> 00:21:25.918
and so where does it come from?

494
00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:28.424
It is the byproduct of thermite,

495
00:21:28.424 --> 00:21:30.846
this incendiary, which is a huge

496
00:21:30.846 --> 00:21:34.088
reaction between iron

497
00:21:34.088 --> 00:21:38.802
iron oxide, which is basically rust

498
00:21:38.802 --> 00:21:40.893
and aluminum particles.

499
00:21:40.893 --> 00:21:42.008
When they,

500
00:21:42.008 --> 00:21:44.930
under very hot with a very hot ignition,

501
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:48.162
it starts a reaction which produces lots

502
00:21:48.162 --> 00:21:51.479
and lots of molten iron.

503
00:21:51.479 --> 00:21:54.018
If you had thousands of cutter charges

504
00:21:54.018 --> 00:21:56.471
in the beams,

505
00:21:56.471 --> 00:21:59.372
you would have not only

506
00:21:59.372 --> 00:22:02.028
molten iron being produced,

507
00:22:02.028 --> 00:22:03.489
but something else that's found thoughout

508
00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:05.249
the World Trade Center dust,

509
00:22:05.249 --> 00:22:07.414
this ubitquous layer of four

510
00:22:07.414 --> 00:22:10.870
to 12 inch thick blanket of snow.

511
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.331
It's actually powder.

512
00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:14.752
30% of it is concrete by the way.

513
00:22:14.752 --> 00:22:17.227
Concrete powder.

514
00:22:17.227 --> 00:22:20.205
How do you turn 90,000 tons of concrete

515
00:22:20.205 --> 00:22:22.498
in the World Trade Center towers and building seven

516
00:22:22.498 --> 00:22:24.109
into powder?

517
00:22:24.109 --> 00:22:25.869
And what's in that powder?

518
00:22:25.869 --> 00:22:30.869
Small microspheres of previously molten iron.

519
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.692
<v Woman>That wouldn't happen naturally.</v>

520
00:22:33.858 --> 00:22:36.129
<v ->Well you need 2,800 degrees.</v>

521
00:22:36.129 --> 00:22:36.855
<v Woman>Yeah, exactly.</v>

522
00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:39.020
<v ->You don't get that in a gravitational collapse.</v>

523
00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.801
You don't get that in office fires.

524
00:22:40.801 --> 00:22:42.966
You don't get that in jet fuel fires.

525
00:22:42.966 --> 00:22:45.846
Jet fuel being basically kerosene, a hydrocarbon,

526
00:22:45.846 --> 00:22:48.609
which doesn't burn any hotter than desks or chairs.

527
00:22:48.609 --> 00:22:53.609
These are perfectly round, spherical spheres.

528
00:22:53.888 --> 00:22:56.438
Most of them are about the diameter of a human hair.

529
00:22:56.438 --> 00:22:58.763
They're in all the dust.

530
00:22:58.763 --> 00:23:02.965
The EPA, R.J. Lee,

531
00:23:02.965 --> 00:23:06.348
and environmental firm, uses it as a signature element

532
00:23:06.348 --> 00:23:07.468
in the dust.

533
00:23:07.468 --> 00:23:09.126
This is

534
00:23:10.092 --> 00:23:12.151
direct evidence of temperatures

535
00:23:12.151 --> 00:23:14.177
exceeding 2,800 degrees,

536
00:23:14.177 --> 00:23:15.958
and that in the air.

537
00:23:15.958 --> 00:23:19.051
Under explosive conditions, these cutter charges

538
00:23:19.051 --> 00:23:24.051
would indeed produce out of a spray bottle,

539
00:23:24.299 --> 00:23:26.710
under pressure liquid atomizes itself and

540
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:30.432
forms itself into spheres because of the surface tension.

541
00:23:30.432 --> 00:23:32.128
This would be tremendously dispersed

542
00:23:32.128 --> 00:23:35.722
under explosive conditions, which apparently we had

543
00:23:35.722 --> 00:23:38.069
in addition to the incendiaries,

544
00:23:38.069 --> 00:23:41.877
explosives which are hurling nine,

545
00:23:41.877 --> 00:23:44.841
10 perimeter wall units laterally

546
00:23:44.841 --> 00:23:47.956
at 70 miles instant speed, 70 miles an hour,

547
00:23:47.956 --> 00:23:51.508
landing up to 600 feet away.

548
00:23:51.508 --> 00:23:54.089
<v Woman>And plumes moving upward as well.</v>

549
00:23:54.089 --> 00:23:57.950
<v ->Well, yeah, there's plumes at the top</v>

550
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.873
of the twin towers

551
00:24:00.873 --> 00:24:04.521
that are upward, outward, arching

552
00:24:04.521 --> 00:24:09.090
streamers, pyroclastic like

553
00:24:09.171 --> 00:24:12.072
clouds where these hot gases produce this

554
00:24:12.072 --> 00:24:15.895
cauliflower shapes that

555
00:24:16.552 --> 00:24:20.658
are full of suspended and pulverized building solids.

556
00:24:20.658 --> 00:24:22.120
<v Woman>All the mark of explosives.</v>

557
00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.517
<v ->Yeah, this is not something that even looks</v>

558
00:24:23.517 --> 00:24:25.554
like a gravitational collapse.

559
00:24:25.554 --> 00:24:27.602
I'm embarrassed to say that it took

560
00:24:27.602 --> 00:24:29.249
me four years to

561
00:24:29.436 --> 00:24:30.855
<v Woman>Well again, by what we're told,</v>

562
00:24:30.855 --> 00:24:33.170
we see what we're told to see.

563
00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:34.823
<v ->We're tremendously programmable.</v>

564
00:24:34.823 --> 00:24:35.633
<v Woman>Yes we are.</v>

565
00:24:35.633 --> 00:24:36.839
<v ->And this is part of the difficulty of</v>

566
00:24:36.839 --> 00:24:38.673
people facing this evidence.

567
00:24:38.673 --> 00:24:43.019
Once we get people into a

568
00:24:43.068 --> 00:24:46.777
presentation or in front of the DVD where

569
00:24:46.777 --> 00:24:49.182
we lay this out fairly scientifically without any

570
00:24:49.182 --> 00:24:53.683
theories, no political agenda, no conspiracy theories,

571
00:24:53.683 --> 00:24:55.965
by a show of hands in these groups

572
00:24:55.965 --> 00:24:57.843
of people we present this to,

573
00:24:57.843 --> 00:25:00.978
100 to 700 throughout the world,

574
00:25:00.978 --> 00:25:04.488
80% of them to 90% of them

575
00:25:04.488 --> 00:25:08.039
end up agreeing with us that yes,

576
00:25:08.039 --> 00:25:09.309
this evidence seems real.

577
00:25:09.309 --> 00:25:13.052
Yes, it's indicative of a controlled demolition.

578
00:25:13.052 --> 00:25:16.508
Yes, why didn't I hear about this

579
00:25:16.508 --> 00:25:17.927
before?

580
00:25:17.927 --> 00:25:22.108
Many of them will end up signing our petition.

581
00:25:22.108 --> 00:25:25.169
It's the people that aren't willing to face

582
00:25:25.169 --> 00:25:26.939
this evidence, to look at it,

583
00:25:26.939 --> 00:25:28.859
and there are a number of those people

584
00:25:28.859 --> 00:25:31.281
who just wanna call us names,

585
00:25:31.281 --> 00:25:33.318
like conspiracy theorists.

586
00:25:33.318 --> 00:25:38.165
Those are the people that are

587
00:25:38.288 --> 00:25:41.541
not reachable with this evidence.

588
00:25:41.541 --> 00:25:43.610
<v Woman>Right, because the mind can't be opened</v>

589
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:45.136
for some reason,

590
00:25:45.136 --> 00:25:47.344
and it has to do with beliefs and a lot of things.

591
00:25:47.344 --> 00:25:49.573
All of us know people who can't contend

592
00:25:49.573 --> 00:25:51.226
with this kind of information.

593
00:25:51.226 --> 00:25:53.455
<v ->And that evidence is</v>

594
00:25:53.455 --> 00:25:58.234
as simple as for instance, there's 110 floors

595
00:25:58.234 --> 00:26:00.345
in each of these towers.

596
00:26:00.345 --> 00:26:04.462
They're each an acre in size, the twin towers floors.

597
00:26:04.462 --> 00:26:07.129
Wouldn't we in a gravitational collapse

598
00:26:07.129 --> 00:26:10.382
expect to see about 110 stacks of

599
00:26:10.382 --> 00:26:15.203
concrete over 22 gage metal decking

600
00:26:15.203 --> 00:26:17.827
over about 10,000 floor trusses

601
00:26:17.827 --> 00:26:18.808
all together.

602
00:26:18.808 --> 00:26:21.528
Would we expect to see those in a 20 story heap

603
00:26:21.528 --> 00:26:22.563
down at the bottom?

604
00:26:22.563 --> 00:26:23.640
<v Woman>In the debris, of course, yes.</v>

605
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.626
<v ->That would be a natural expectation.</v>

606
00:26:26.626 --> 00:26:28.813
What are we seeing in the photographs though?

607
00:26:28.813 --> 00:26:30.480
A two story pile of

608
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.296
core columns, perimeter columns, aluminum clatting,

609
00:26:33.296 --> 00:26:35.130
miscellaneous metal.

610
00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:37.935
There's very little concrete.

611
00:26:37.935 --> 00:26:39.930
You can't see it in the photographs in fact.

612
00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.694
There's so little of it.

613
00:26:41.764 --> 00:26:43.156
Where did it go?

614
00:26:43.236 --> 00:26:45.999
It's being pulverized in mid air,

615
00:26:45.999 --> 00:26:47.737
90,000 tons of it,

616
00:26:47.737 --> 00:26:49.263
and we know where it went.

617
00:26:49.263 --> 00:26:51.151
It went in all of that dust,

618
00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:54.862
which comprises 30% of the powder really

619
00:26:54.862 --> 00:26:56.254
is what it is.

620
00:26:56.345 --> 00:26:59.417
<v Woman>And when you look at some of the video,</v>

621
00:26:59.417 --> 00:27:02.318
what we see also are some have called

622
00:27:02.318 --> 00:27:05.379
them squiffs or perhaps mistimed

623
00:27:05.379 --> 00:27:06.819
explosions that happened

624
00:27:06.819 --> 00:27:10.819
WTC one and two in the towers,

625
00:27:10.819 --> 00:27:14.040
and you're looking at essentially,

626
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.685
windows blowing out with plumes

627
00:27:16.685 --> 00:27:18.914
of explosive dust, blowing out

628
00:27:18.914 --> 00:27:22.732
in the windows below where the impact

629
00:27:22.732 --> 00:27:24.492
had occurred, where there was any fire,

630
00:27:24.492 --> 00:27:26.305
and any other disturbance at that moment.

631
00:27:26.305 --> 00:27:28.952
It hadn't impacted down to that level yet.

632
00:27:28.952 --> 00:27:30.066
It hadn't

633
00:27:31.264 --> 00:27:32.419
what do you call that when you're collapsing

634
00:27:32.419 --> 00:27:33.603
in on itself?

635
00:27:33.603 --> 00:27:35.789
That debris hadn't reached that point where

636
00:27:35.789 --> 00:27:37.827
these explosions were blowing out

637
00:27:37.827 --> 00:27:39.341
all down the building.

638
00:27:39.341 --> 00:27:41.826
<v ->Yeah, well what we're told is that</v>

639
00:27:41.826 --> 00:27:44.632
these are puffs of air,

640
00:27:44.632 --> 00:27:46.306
and by the way they occur 20 40

641
00:27:46.306 --> 00:27:48.205
and even 60 stories down below this

642
00:27:48.205 --> 00:27:49.975
so called crush zone.

643
00:27:49.975 --> 00:27:51.159
<v Woman>Crush zone, that's what I was</v>

644
00:27:51.159 --> 00:27:51.970
looking for.
<v ->These puffs</v>

645
00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:55.404
of air are supposed to be the result

646
00:27:55.404 --> 00:27:58.401
of massive quantities of air being pushed

647
00:27:58.401 --> 00:27:59.905
down through the elevator hoistway

648
00:27:59.905 --> 00:28:02.604
by this 10 to 15 story section up there.

649
00:28:02.604 --> 00:28:06.198
<v Woman>Impossible with an intact buffer of 20, 40, 60</v>

650
00:28:06.198 --> 00:28:08.566
floors.

651
00:28:08.566 --> 00:28:11.446
<v ->Well, that's certainly an argument, yes,</v>

652
00:28:11.446 --> 00:28:13.494
but also they're not puffs of air.

653
00:28:13.494 --> 00:28:14.070
<v Woman>No.</v>

654
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.744
<v ->They're pulverized building materials.</v>

655
00:28:15.744 --> 00:28:17.301
You can see the solids,

656
00:28:17.301 --> 00:28:20.299
and they're occurring

657
00:28:20.299 --> 00:28:24.640
at the midpoint, in the middle of the fasad.

658
00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.466
If you had tremendous quantities of air

659
00:28:27.466 --> 00:28:29.119
coming down to the hoistway,

660
00:28:29.119 --> 00:28:31.903
it would fill these wide open spaces

661
00:28:31.903 --> 00:28:34.090
which these floors were with

662
00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:37.983
air pressure, and if it blew out any of these windows,

663
00:28:37.983 --> 00:28:39.732
it might blow them all out,

664
00:28:39.732 --> 00:28:42.239
but not these highly focalized

665
00:28:42.239 --> 00:28:45.396
geometrically precise violent ejections

666
00:28:45.396 --> 00:28:47.998
that are obviously an engineered pattern.

667
00:28:47.998 --> 00:28:50.227
More importantly than any of that,

668
00:28:50.227 --> 00:28:54.003
it turns out that there is no 10 to 15

669
00:28:54.003 --> 00:28:56.702
story section of

670
00:28:56.702 --> 00:28:59.112
World Trade Center north tower above

671
00:28:59.112 --> 00:29:00.691
the point of jet plane impacts.

672
00:29:00.691 --> 00:29:02.269
We're told that drove the rest of the building

673
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:04.968
down to the ground, but in the first four seconds

674
00:29:04.968 --> 00:29:07.634
it's destroying itself.

675
00:29:07.634 --> 00:29:11.186
It's like a mini controlled demolition.

676
00:29:11.186 --> 00:29:13.394
It's telescoping in on itself

677
00:29:13.394 --> 00:29:16.415
before there's any motion downward.

678
00:29:16.415 --> 00:29:18.164
It has destroyed itself in the first

679
00:29:18.164 --> 00:29:21.417
four seconds with bands of explosions

680
00:29:21.417 --> 00:29:23.667
just like the first responders reported

681
00:29:23.667 --> 00:29:26.473
in these 118 cases.

682
00:29:26.473 --> 00:29:30.120
All the way around the building, wrapping like a belt,

683
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.582
all the way around the building,

684
00:29:31.582 --> 00:29:32.328
and they would say, pop pop pop

685
00:29:32.328 --> 00:29:36.573
at the beginning, and this is all highlighted on

686
00:29:36.573 --> 00:29:39.426
our DVD, these different quotes.

687
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.962
After that first four seconds

688
00:29:42.962 --> 00:29:45.639
what we see, very clearly in the videos is

689
00:29:45.639 --> 00:29:49.191
the building tearing itself apart,

690
00:29:49.191 --> 00:29:52.743
and that occurs, just like the mini controlled demolition

691
00:29:52.743 --> 00:29:57.148
above, it occurs almost at free fall acceleration.

692
00:29:57.148 --> 00:30:00.401
The buildings are destroyed in about a dozen seconds.

693
00:30:00.401 --> 00:30:03.772
This is incredible.

694
00:30:03.772 --> 00:30:05.014
The rate is

695
00:30:05.841 --> 00:30:08.625
10 floors per second almost.

696
00:30:08.625 --> 00:30:10.545
This is amazing.

697
00:30:10.545 --> 00:30:14.352
You can't even clap your hands that fast.

698
00:30:14.352 --> 00:30:19.120
It's being self consumed,

699
00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.320
and we see racing down below the crush zone

700
00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.474
in addition to these isolated plumes,

701
00:30:24.474 --> 00:30:27.994
these waves of explosions that are actually

702
00:30:27.994 --> 00:30:30.298
traveling faster down the building

703
00:30:30.298 --> 00:30:33.221
than the free falling debris next to it

704
00:30:33.221 --> 00:30:35.716
at times that's how fast those

705
00:30:35.716 --> 00:30:39.428
explosions are going of.

706
00:30:39.428 --> 00:30:41.638
In the South tower they're completely uniform

707
00:30:41.638 --> 00:30:43.835
around the south tower, even though

708
00:30:43.835 --> 00:30:48.091
this building has fallen 22 degrees at an angle,

709
00:30:48.091 --> 00:30:50.950
and one would expect that

710
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:54.704
to continue and fall on the ground in some mangled

711
00:30:54.704 --> 00:30:56.027
heap, but it doesn't.

712
00:30:56.027 --> 00:30:59.856
It's uniformly distributed in a 1,400 foot radius,

713
00:30:59.856 --> 00:31:02.256
about each of the

714
00:31:02.256 --> 00:31:07.256
twin towers, and we have asymmetrical damage from

715
00:31:07.663 --> 00:31:11.172
the airplanes, asymmetrical damage from the fires,

716
00:31:11.172 --> 00:31:13.031
asymmetrical loading from this

717
00:31:13.031 --> 00:31:17.468
off center structure, and yet looking

718
00:31:17.468 --> 00:31:20.465
down below we see complete symmetry,

719
00:31:20.465 --> 00:31:22.995
bands of explosions traveling at two thirds

720
00:31:22.995 --> 00:31:25.427
of free fall acceleration straight down the building.

721
00:31:25.427 --> 00:31:28.285
<v Woman>And again, how many people,</v>

722
00:31:28.285 --> 00:31:30.301
I don't remember now the number of witnesses on

723
00:31:30.301 --> 00:31:31.560
the ground that talked about this,

724
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.554
but even one of our interviewees totally

725
00:31:33.554 --> 00:31:35.229
unrelated to the subject, happened

726
00:31:35.229 --> 00:31:37.735
to be there on that day, and

727
00:31:37.735 --> 00:31:38.898
said the exact same thing.

728
00:31:38.898 --> 00:31:40.892
They heard the explosions as well,

729
00:31:40.892 --> 00:31:44.071
and so, I mean this is well documented.

730
00:31:44.071 --> 00:31:46.625
It's just not in anything official.

731
00:31:46.972 --> 00:31:49.180
That brings up a question, and there

732
00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:50.620
are many other factors, and I really highly

733
00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:53.009
encourage everybody watching this

734
00:31:53.009 --> 00:31:54.545
to get a copy of the DVD and look

735
00:31:54.545 --> 00:31:57.638
at this evidence for themselves, show to anybody

736
00:31:57.638 --> 00:31:59.915
with an open mind, because we're coming

737
00:31:59.915 --> 00:32:02.496
up on the 10 year anniversary of this event.

738
00:32:02.496 --> 00:32:05.967
We absolutely need to re open this investigation.

739
00:32:06.048 --> 00:32:07.648
It needs to be looked at with fresh eyes,

740
00:32:07.648 --> 00:32:08.597
demanded.

741
00:32:08.597 --> 00:32:11.082
This brings me to the question,

742
00:32:11.082 --> 00:32:14.570
who are these people at NIST,

743
00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:16.991
National Institute of Standards and Technology?

744
00:32:16.991 --> 00:32:19.124
How could they have been

745
00:32:19.124 --> 00:32:23.092
wrong about the forensics in every single

746
00:32:23.092 --> 00:32:25.887
area that was looked at?

747
00:32:25.887 --> 00:32:28.574
Because you have certain

748
00:32:28.574 --> 00:32:30.057
protocol you have to go through to look at

749
00:32:30.057 --> 00:32:31.614
to determine what would indicate

750
00:32:31.614 --> 00:32:36.614
a demolition job, and via explosives,

751
00:32:36.702 --> 00:32:40.531
and all three buildings have the hallmarks

752
00:32:40.531 --> 00:32:42.088
in every single case.

753
00:32:42.088 --> 00:32:43.432
None of them have the hallmarks

754
00:32:43.432 --> 00:32:46.312
of a building as you say that is gravitational

755
00:32:46.312 --> 00:32:47.869
collapse due to fire, none of them.

756
00:32:49.319 --> 00:32:51.339
Who are these people NIST?

757
00:32:51.339 --> 00:32:53.131
This is fraudulent.

758
00:32:53.131 --> 00:32:55.616
<v ->It sure is, and we're calling for a federal grand jury</v>

759
00:32:55.616 --> 00:32:59.626
investigation by US attorney general, Eric Holder,

760
00:32:59.626 --> 00:33:02.858
of the key individuals at NIST, Shawn sundered

761
00:33:02.858 --> 00:33:06.762
the lead investigator and also,

762
00:33:06.762 --> 00:33:09.188
John Gross, the co project leader.

763
00:33:09.407 --> 00:33:14.377
I don't know about their histories and specifically

764
00:33:14.377 --> 00:33:15.679
who they are.

765
00:33:15.679 --> 00:33:17.556
We do know that they are lying.

766
00:33:17.556 --> 00:33:20.457
We have several

767
00:33:20.457 --> 00:33:22.942
in public appearances they are caught lying,

768
00:33:22.942 --> 00:33:24.201
both of them.

769
00:33:24.201 --> 00:33:27.144
John Gross in terms of his abject denial

770
00:33:27.144 --> 00:33:31.443
of the evidence for extremely hot temperatures

771
00:33:31.443 --> 00:33:35.176
exceeding the melting point of steel.

772
00:33:37.928 --> 00:33:40.189
There are so many problems throughout

773
00:33:40.189 --> 00:33:42.039
these reports.

774
00:33:43.879 --> 00:33:47.847
The biggest one is that they started

775
00:33:47.847 --> 00:33:51.324
with a predetermined conclusion,

776
00:33:51.324 --> 00:33:52.626
that is that these buildings came down

777
00:33:52.626 --> 00:33:55.761
by office fires, and in the case of the Twin Towers,

778
00:33:55.761 --> 00:33:58.108
jet plane impacts as well.

779
00:33:58.108 --> 00:34:00.518
Then they bend over backwards, manipulating

780
00:34:00.518 --> 00:34:03.750
their computer input data, which they will not

781
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:06.395
release by the way

782
00:34:06.395 --> 00:34:11.395
after a FOIA request, Freedom of Information Act,

783
00:34:11.526 --> 00:34:14.747
citing that in the case of building seven

784
00:34:14.747 --> 00:34:18.384
that this could jeopardize public safety,

785
00:34:18.384 --> 00:34:20.528
that's the reason that they

786
00:34:20.528 --> 00:34:21.936
are not releasing this.

787
00:34:21.936 --> 00:34:23.909
Well this building has been destroyed.

788
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:24.954
How can it possibly?

789
00:34:24.954 --> 00:34:25.680
<v Woman>Exactly.</v>

790
00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:27.557
<v ->In fact it's worse.</v>

791
00:34:27.557 --> 00:34:30.810
If this information is not released, it could

792
00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:31.994
jeopardize public safety.

793
00:34:31.994 --> 00:34:36.218
After all, a fires brought building seven down,

794
00:34:36.218 --> 00:34:37.507
and then

795
00:34:37.507 --> 00:34:41.924
then fires could bring some other high rise down.

796
00:34:41.924 --> 00:34:44.985
All our buildings may be in jeopardy of falling

797
00:34:44.985 --> 00:34:48.003
at free fall acceleration after burning

798
00:34:48.003 --> 00:34:50.088
for four or five hours.

799
00:34:50.649 --> 00:34:53.891
It's a huge problem that's not acknowledged

800
00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:55.470
<v Woman>But the removal of evidence</v>

801
00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:57.603
and the covering up of their findings,

802
00:34:57.603 --> 00:34:58.968
all of this is part of this.

803
00:34:58.968 --> 00:35:02.179
Really what's turning into a rather sinister story.

804
00:35:02.179 --> 00:35:06.936
<v ->Yeah, it requires a criminal investigation, and</v>

805
00:35:06.936 --> 00:35:10.786
just like criminal investigations, we wanna know who

806
00:35:10.786 --> 00:35:13.943
had the means, the motive, the opportunity.

807
00:35:13.943 --> 00:35:17.154
Who benefited?

808
00:35:17.154 --> 00:35:21.100
And follow the money.

809
00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:24.183
These are the kinds of questions that enterprising

810
00:35:24.183 --> 00:35:28.390
journalists should be asking, and

811
00:35:28.673 --> 00:35:31.755
largely they're not, or they're not being

812
00:35:31.755 --> 00:35:34.512
reported on the mainstream media.

813
00:35:35.505 --> 00:35:37.920
That in and of itself is evidence

814
00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:41.077
of a cover up, the fact that this rock solid

815
00:35:41.077 --> 00:35:45.466
scientific forensic based evidence is

816
00:35:46.741 --> 00:35:48.533
not even given

817
00:35:48.533 --> 00:35:51.711
such as for instance, we didn't even mention this,

818
00:35:51.711 --> 00:35:54.805
throughout the World Trade Center dust

819
00:35:54.805 --> 00:35:58.580
we have small red gray chips

820
00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:01.279
of nano thermite composite explosives.

821
00:36:01.279 --> 00:36:01.887
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

822
00:36:01.887 --> 00:36:03.508
<v ->This is explosives.</v>

823
00:36:03.508 --> 00:36:04.713
What's it doing there?

824
00:36:04.713 --> 00:36:05.993
It should not be there.

825
00:36:05.993 --> 00:36:09.054
This is a fascinating story about a couple

826
00:36:09.054 --> 00:36:10.686
of year ago.

827
00:36:10.686 --> 00:36:13.587
This small team of international

828
00:36:13.587 --> 00:36:17.651
team of scientists found in all of their dust samples

829
00:36:17.651 --> 00:36:22.366
these hundreds of these small red gray chips

830
00:36:22.366 --> 00:36:25.149
a 16th of an inch long, some of them.

831
00:36:25.149 --> 00:36:27.351
Others were smaller, and

832
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.813
in each of these cases they have the same

833
00:36:30.813 --> 00:36:32.061
make up.

834
00:36:32.061 --> 00:36:33.298
What is that?

835
00:36:33.298 --> 00:36:37.287
Small particles of iron oxide and aluminum powder,

836
00:36:37.287 --> 00:36:38.493
that's thermite.

837
00:36:38.493 --> 00:36:39.911
They're in the proportion to each other

838
00:36:39.911 --> 00:36:41.330
to make up thermite,

839
00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:44.114
but these particles are so small

840
00:36:44.114 --> 00:36:48.113
thousand times smaller than the human hair diameter.

841
00:36:48.113 --> 00:36:50.108
These are nano scale particles,

842
00:36:50.108 --> 00:36:52.572
nano engineered intimately mixed,

843
00:36:52.572 --> 00:36:57.572
set in a bed of organics, a matrix of silica oxygen

844
00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:02.453
and carbon.

845
00:37:02.971 --> 00:37:04.426
This is

846
00:37:05.104 --> 00:37:08.752
an extremely sophisticated material, and it blows

847
00:37:08.752 --> 00:37:12.069
up by the way when it's heated up to about 420

848
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:13.349
degrees centigrade.

849
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:17.455
What does it do when it ignites at that temperature?

850
00:37:17.455 --> 00:37:20.965
In the heater, it releases

851
00:37:20.965 --> 00:37:25.210
tens of thousands of very small iron

852
00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:26.665
microspheres.

853
00:37:26.703 --> 00:37:30.041
Now these small iron microspheres have the exact

854
00:37:30.041 --> 00:37:32.366
same chemical make up as that

855
00:37:32.366 --> 00:37:35.865
as those found the USGS throughout all

856
00:37:35.865 --> 00:37:38.169
the World Trade Center dust.

857
00:37:38.169 --> 00:37:40.217
We know where all those spheres came from

858
00:37:40.217 --> 00:37:42.691
all of a sudden, from all of those chips,

859
00:37:42.691 --> 00:37:45.528
and all of those incendiaries.

860
00:37:45.528 --> 00:37:48.347
<v Woman>Those would be like unignited</v>

861
00:37:48.347 --> 00:37:49.360
chips.

862
00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.640
<v ->This chips are unignited.</v>

863
00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.357
The spheres are evidence of

864
00:37:52.357 --> 00:37:53.424
the ignited chips
<v Woman>Of the ignited.</v>

865
00:37:53.424 --> 00:37:57.210
<v ->And the chips are found with the spheres attached</v>

866
00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:00.133
to them in many of the samples.

867
00:38:00.133 --> 00:38:04.986
This is extraordinary compelling, iron clad evidence

868
00:38:04.986 --> 00:38:07.428
that well at least

869
00:38:07.428 --> 00:38:10.329
that there were incendiaries,

870
00:38:10.329 --> 00:38:14.830
high tech incendiaries, and maybe explosive

871
00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:17.113
incendiaries, because these materials, these

872
00:38:17.113 --> 00:38:19.065
pyrotechnic materials can be engineered to become

873
00:38:19.065 --> 00:38:20.334
explosive.

874
00:38:20.334 --> 00:38:22.361
This is documented by Lawrence Liverm,

875
00:38:22.361 --> 00:38:23.886
or lab Los Alamos lab,

876
00:38:23.886 --> 00:38:25.678
in the late 1990s.

877
00:38:25.678 --> 00:38:29.901
It's not some mystical thing.

878
00:38:29.901 --> 00:38:31.085
<v Woman>How long would it take?</v>

879
00:38:31.085 --> 00:38:34.456
People listening right now, our viewers are wondering

880
00:38:34.456 --> 00:38:38.146
how long it would take to actually engineer

881
00:38:38.146 --> 00:38:41.969
such a demolition in these buildings.

882
00:38:42.114 --> 00:38:45.015
<v ->It would take dozens of people,</v>

883
00:38:45.015 --> 00:38:49.148
men, workers, months to

884
00:38:49.217 --> 00:38:50.401
put together.

885
00:38:50.401 --> 00:38:52.801
This didn't happen in an afternoon.

886
00:38:57.521 --> 00:38:59.052
How would they get access for instance

887
00:38:59.052 --> 00:39:00.161
in the case of the

888
00:39:00.161 --> 00:39:01.046
Twin Towers
<v Woman>One would have to</v>

889
00:39:01.046 --> 00:39:02.838
assume they must be working at night.

890
00:39:02.838 --> 00:39:05.243
<v ->Well, not really.</v>

891
00:39:05.408 --> 00:39:07.243
It turns out if you had access to the core

892
00:39:07.243 --> 00:39:10.080
column, to the elevator shafts in the Twin Towers,

893
00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.267
you would, that would give you access to the

894
00:39:12.267 --> 00:39:14.261
core columns and beams, because

895
00:39:14.261 --> 00:39:16.768
all of the core columns

896
00:39:16.768 --> 00:39:20.672
are grouped around the elevators

897
00:39:20.672 --> 00:39:21.823
in the Twin Towers.

898
00:39:21.823 --> 00:39:25.333
You don't have beams and columns rising through

899
00:39:25.333 --> 00:39:26.551
the office space.

900
00:39:26.551 --> 00:39:28.311
<v Woman>It wouldn't even necessarily,</v>

901
00:39:28.311 --> 00:39:30.796
there would even necessarily be a red flag to anybody

902
00:39:30.796 --> 00:39:33.356
that's an occupant of that building if you have workers

903
00:39:33.356 --> 00:39:36.023
coming and going, and working around the elevator shafts.

904
00:39:36.023 --> 00:39:39.094
<v ->Especially if you had the largest elevator</v>

905
00:39:39.094 --> 00:39:42.384
modernization going on in history, which we did.

906
00:39:42.572 --> 00:39:45.451
The nine months prior to 9/11.

907
00:39:45.451 --> 00:39:46.027
Ace Elevator

908
00:39:46.027 --> 00:39:47.904
had this contract.
<v Woman>Good point.</v>

909
00:39:47.904 --> 00:39:50.603
<v ->We're looking for an investigation</v>

910
00:39:50.603 --> 00:39:54.016
into Ace Elevator, as well as the security company.

911
00:39:54.016 --> 00:39:55.754
Securecom and Stratosec, which

912
00:39:55.754 --> 00:39:58.655
had the security contract up until

913
00:39:58.655 --> 00:40:01.764
the day of 9/11, interestingly enough.

914
00:40:02.485 --> 00:40:05.663
By the way those elevator employees scattered

915
00:40:05.663 --> 00:40:08.361
after the first plane hit.

916
00:40:08.361 --> 00:40:11.892
They are normally bound to help the

917
00:40:11.892 --> 00:40:13.908
firefighters rescue the victims.

918
00:40:13.908 --> 00:40:16.414
They're experts in those vehicles,

919
00:40:16.414 --> 00:40:19.571
the elevator cabs, but

920
00:40:19.571 --> 00:40:21.438
it was a scandal.

921
00:40:21.438 --> 00:40:25.032
USA documented their fleeing the site

922
00:40:25.032 --> 00:40:28.226
shortly after 9/11.

923
00:40:28.328 --> 00:40:30.045
This was documented.

924
00:40:31.655 --> 00:40:33.160
We certainly need an investigation

925
00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.506
that's broader than just the buildings,

926
00:40:35.506 --> 00:40:38.824
the security company, the elevator company.

927
00:40:39.764 --> 00:40:41.597
<v Woman>There were some other issues</v>

928
00:40:41.597 --> 00:40:44.221
that were taking place with insurance policies,

929
00:40:44.221 --> 00:40:45.597
and so forth just prior to it.

930
00:40:45.597 --> 00:40:49.996
There were other economic factors involved, and

931
00:40:50.556 --> 00:40:52.999
you're right, everything needs to

932
00:40:52.999 --> 00:40:55.969
come up for review now,

933
00:40:56.433 --> 00:40:57.830
and it is, even just sitting here

934
00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:01.169
I started listening to these other reports

935
00:41:01.169 --> 00:41:04.838
within minutes after the buildings went down,

936
00:41:04.838 --> 00:41:09.712
and I felt fairly clear, almost immediately

937
00:41:09.712 --> 00:41:11.174
that this was inside job.

938
00:41:11.174 --> 00:41:13.712
It didn't ring true for me.

939
00:41:13.712 --> 00:41:15.568
None of it I was hearing on the news

940
00:41:15.568 --> 00:41:16.496
was ringing true.

941
00:41:17.326 --> 00:41:20.549
Nonetheless, even sitting here talking with you

942
00:41:20.549 --> 00:41:23.887
over nine years later, it still puts my stomach

943
00:41:23.887 --> 00:41:27.589
in a knot to think that it has not been revealed.

944
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:28.858
It has not been dealt with,

945
00:41:28.858 --> 00:41:32.250
that the course of history, our history globally

946
00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:35.268
has been changed as a result of this,

947
00:41:35.268 --> 00:41:37.401
the bringing down of these buildings,

948
00:41:37.401 --> 00:41:41.102
and yet this feeling, this tense feeling of

949
00:41:41.102 --> 00:41:42.788
what now?

950
00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.215
What now?

951
00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.795
<v ->Yeah, what now?</v>

952
00:41:48.795 --> 00:41:53.072
Well for four years we've been screaming

953
00:41:53.072 --> 00:41:55.280
in the wind, if you will, trying to wake up

954
00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.754
architects, engineers, and others.

955
00:41:59.258 --> 00:42:03.428
What we're involved in is a grassroots movement

956
00:42:03.428 --> 00:42:07.091
that's not receiving air time in the media,

957
00:42:07.353 --> 00:42:09.743
which by the way is owned by six corporations,

958
00:42:09.743 --> 00:42:11.161
90% of it.

959
00:42:11.161 --> 00:42:13.529
Who sits on the board of directors of those

960
00:42:13.529 --> 00:42:15.694
corporations by the way?

961
00:42:15.694 --> 00:42:18.009
The same individual sitting in the boards

962
00:42:18.009 --> 00:42:23.000
of the corporations in the arms industry,

963
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.288
the oil industry, the banking industry,

964
00:42:25.288 --> 00:42:27.485
the insurance industry.

965
00:42:27.566 --> 00:42:32.045
These industries profited enormously from 9/11,

966
00:42:32.045 --> 00:42:34.061
and should be benefited as part as a,

967
00:42:34.061 --> 00:42:37.848
should be investigated as part of

968
00:42:37.848 --> 00:42:39.857
the quebono here.

969
00:42:44.004 --> 00:42:45.758
Forgot what I was gonna say.

970
00:42:46.234 --> 00:42:47.710
<v Woman>What now?</v>

971
00:42:47.759 --> 00:42:48.580
The what now part.

972
00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:51.641
<v ->This is a grassroots movement,</v>

973
00:42:51.641 --> 00:42:53.380
and it's growing by millions every year,

974
00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:55.662
and we're getting no help from the mainstream media.

975
00:42:55.662 --> 00:42:59.001
We're asking everybody to do something.

976
00:42:59.001 --> 00:43:00.515
What can people do?

977
00:43:00.515 --> 00:43:02.947
A number of things, one,

978
00:43:02.947 --> 00:43:04.643
get informed first of all.

979
00:43:04.643 --> 00:43:06.968
The internet is a source of information

980
00:43:06.968 --> 00:43:09.773
that you're not going to see in the mainstream media.

981
00:43:09.773 --> 00:43:12.675
We're asking everybody to send the AE 9/11 truth.org

982
00:43:12.675 --> 00:43:17.549
link to every architect and engineer in your community,

983
00:43:17.549 --> 00:43:20.269
and everybody else that you know.

984
00:43:20.269 --> 00:43:24.887
This is growing by leaps and bounds,

985
00:43:24.887 --> 00:43:27.820
but it needs to grow

986
00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:32.136
it needs to grow a lot faster if we're gonna have

987
00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:33.486
change.
<v Woman>Are we opening a new</v>

988
00:43:33.486 --> 00:43:34.393
investigation?

989
00:43:34.393 --> 00:43:35.107
Yeah
<v ->Yes,</v>

990
00:43:35.107 --> 00:43:37.966
there's nobody in Congress for instance,

991
00:43:37.966 --> 00:43:39.683
calling for a new investigation

992
00:43:39.683 --> 00:43:43.619
openly, outwardly we have Dennis Casinage,

993
00:43:43.619 --> 00:43:47.288
Ron Paul who have supported a new investigation.

994
00:43:47.288 --> 00:43:48.931
Nobody can stick their necks out.

995
00:43:48.931 --> 00:43:52.130
This is a taboo subject for some reason,

996
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:55.618
probably because of all the pain we all endured that day.

997
00:43:55.618 --> 00:43:59.495
<v Woman>It's criminal beyond most of our comprehension.</v>

998
00:44:01.474 --> 00:44:02.876
<v ->It seems to be.</v>

999
00:44:03.607 --> 00:44:06.743
We're here as technical building professionals

1000
00:44:06.743 --> 00:44:11.681
to support any investigation that can get going,

1001
00:44:11.681 --> 00:44:14.753
internationally, if Congress is

1002
00:44:14.753 --> 00:44:17.350
going to fail to act.

1003
00:44:18.742 --> 00:44:20.987
<v Woman>We need to,</v>

1004
00:44:21.323 --> 00:44:22.785
again, I'll say this.

1005
00:44:22.785 --> 00:44:25.547
We got a link on the page so people can come

1006
00:44:25.547 --> 00:44:29.611
to the site, get the videos, and start having

1007
00:44:29.611 --> 00:44:32.213
living room gatherings, even if you have an open minded

1008
00:44:32.213 --> 00:44:35.690
community, library gatherings, and public showings

1009
00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:38.709
of this video, and begin demanding

1010
00:44:38.709 --> 00:44:41.071
that the subject be addressed.

1011
00:44:41.567 --> 00:44:43.754
<v ->We'll come to any city and speak.</v>

1012
00:44:43.754 --> 00:44:47.466
Generally there's 100 to 700 people

1013
00:44:47.466 --> 00:44:50.367
at a gathering, and

1014
00:44:50.367 --> 00:44:52.831
again we'll motivate 80% of those who

1015
00:44:52.831 --> 00:44:56.148
were previously skeptical of our position

1016
00:44:56.148 --> 00:44:58.057
to agree with us.

1017
00:44:58.057 --> 00:45:01.929
That's an extraordinary show of

1018
00:45:03.899 --> 00:45:05.225
a reality check.

1019
00:45:05.225 --> 00:45:06.046
<v Woman>Yes, it is.</v>

1020
00:45:06.046 --> 00:45:07.880
<v ->It really, really works.</v>

1021
00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.547
<v Woman>The hardest reality check I think on an emotional</v>

1022
00:45:10.547 --> 00:45:12.872
level, certainly for me and a lot of others

1023
00:45:12.872 --> 00:45:15.976
is that knowing this was a sham from the beginning

1024
00:45:15.976 --> 00:45:18.717
what we have done to ravage the planet

1025
00:45:18.717 --> 00:45:22.066
on every level, to ravage the citizens

1026
00:45:22.066 --> 00:45:25.426
in Afganistan and Iraq,

1027
00:45:25.426 --> 00:45:28.124
and everything that has played out and been

1028
00:45:28.124 --> 00:45:33.095
rolled out by these same players that you're talking about.

1029
00:45:33.095 --> 00:45:34.759
The lives that have been lost, the young

1030
00:45:34.759 --> 00:45:36.711
soldiers who have gone over there with

1031
00:45:36.711 --> 00:45:39.409
an open heart, thinking they're doing the right thing,

1032
00:45:39.409 --> 00:45:42.332
that's I think why this gives everyone such

1033
00:45:42.332 --> 00:45:44.678
a knot in their stomach.

1034
00:45:44.678 --> 00:45:46.886
We can never undo the damage

1035
00:45:46.886 --> 00:45:49.179
that's been done, but we can certainly

1036
00:45:49.179 --> 00:45:50.694
try to address it now

1037
00:45:50.694 --> 00:45:54.267
and call a halt to this before any other

1038
00:45:54.267 --> 00:45:57.215
anything else can be rolled out in it's name.

1039
00:45:58.011 --> 00:46:01.114
<v ->This is a time when America is calling</v>

1040
00:46:01.114 --> 00:46:03.280
forth it's true patriots.

1041
00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:07.151
Not it's false tea party

1042
00:46:07.151 --> 00:46:10.330
patriots, but those who are willing

1043
00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:13.796
to stand up, face the facts, and 9/11,

1044
00:46:13.796 --> 00:46:18.489
well, the buildings, the drops,

1045
00:46:18.489 --> 00:46:20.089
the destruction of these high rises

1046
00:46:20.089 --> 00:46:23.752
on 9/11 is only one piece of the 9/11 pie.

1047
00:46:23.758 --> 00:46:24.795
There are so many other

1048
00:46:24.795 --> 00:46:25.307
<v Woman>Yes there are.</v>

1049
00:46:25.307 --> 00:46:26.277
<v ->Almost every part</v>

1050
00:46:26.277 --> 00:46:27.328
of the official story
<v Woman>This is the symbolic</v>

1051
00:46:27.328 --> 00:46:28.630
piece though.

1052
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:31.414
<v ->This is the piece that can bring the rest of it together</v>

1053
00:46:31.414 --> 00:46:35.893
for most people more easily I agree,

1054
00:46:35.893 --> 00:46:40.352
but 9/11 itself is only one of the major

1055
00:46:40.352 --> 00:46:42.346
problems in our society.

1056
00:46:42.346 --> 00:46:44.597
As you become aware of 9/11 you become aware

1057
00:46:44.597 --> 00:46:48.735
of so many other rabbit holes if you will,

1058
00:46:48.735 --> 00:46:53.735
and we don't discuss those at AE 9/11 truth.

1059
00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:56.607
Others have become experts on these,

1060
00:46:56.607 --> 00:46:59.369
but we realize how important it is for all of us

1061
00:46:59.369 --> 00:47:02.740
in whatever arena we find ourselves called to speak,

1062
00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:06.611
to speak the truth, because once we do that

1063
00:47:06.611 --> 00:47:09.096
we become empowered, more awakened,

1064
00:47:09.096 --> 00:47:13.950
and it's really a revolution of consciousness.

1065
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:16.531
That's why it will be a peaceful revolution,

1066
00:47:16.531 --> 00:47:20.104
because it's an awakening that's happening,

1067
00:47:20.104 --> 00:47:23.325
and once enough Americans become awake

1068
00:47:23.325 --> 00:47:26.653
to these so called conspiracies,

1069
00:47:26.653 --> 00:47:29.362
then they,

1070
00:47:29.362 --> 00:47:32.476
my guess is they'll throw every incumbent

1071
00:47:32.476 --> 00:47:35.335
out of Congress and start over.

1072
00:47:35.335 --> 00:47:37.404
<v Woman>We can only hope that that</v>

1073
00:47:37.404 --> 00:47:41.073
becomes true, and meanwhile

1074
00:47:41.073 --> 00:47:42.673
I just want to thank you so much for

1075
00:47:42.673 --> 00:47:44.390
all of your efforts these years,

1076
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:46.363
for going, and I know that you've

1077
00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:47.942
must of been up against some resistance.

1078
00:47:47.942 --> 00:47:50.267
I don't know if you've had harassment

1079
00:47:50.267 --> 00:47:51.952
of any kind tossed your way,

1080
00:47:51.952 --> 00:47:54.395
and what you've experienced personally as

1081
00:47:54.395 --> 00:47:57.429
a result of taking this on, but

1082
00:47:57.712 --> 00:47:59.899
I'm deeply appreciative that you

1083
00:47:59.899 --> 00:48:02.522
and the others who have chosen to speak up,

1084
00:48:02.522 --> 00:48:04.912
the other architects and engineers have taken this on,

1085
00:48:04.912 --> 00:48:06.981
because I think it does have to come from

1086
00:48:06.981 --> 00:48:10.693
this calmer point of view, which is just look at the facts

1087
00:48:10.693 --> 00:48:14.036
and then we'll start unraveling the rest of the mess.

1088
00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:17.828
<v ->Yes, it's important that we do that,</v>

1089
00:48:17.828 --> 00:48:19.801
and I'm here to help.

1090
00:48:19.801 --> 00:48:20.708
<v Woman>Thank you Richard.</v>

1091
00:48:20.708 --> 00:48:21.811
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1092
00:48:25.188 --> 00:48:26.926
<v ->Please look into this for yourself.</v>

1093
00:48:26.926 --> 00:48:30.691
You can find the DVD through AE 9/11 truth.org.

1094
00:48:30.691 --> 00:48:32.313
When you do look into it, there can be

1095
00:48:32.313 --> 00:48:34.105
no question as to what occurred.

1096
00:48:34.105 --> 00:48:36.536
Then the question becomes, what do we do

1097
00:48:36.536 --> 00:48:38.350
now that we know the truth?

1098
00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:41.319
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
