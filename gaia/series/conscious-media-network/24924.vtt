00:00:00.545 --> 00:00:02.572
<v ->When Robert Peralla was a wee lad,</v>

2
00:00:02.572 --> 00:00:05.042
he began having visitations and seeing dead people.

3
00:00:05.491 --> 00:00:07.201
Much like in the movie The Sixth Sense.

4
00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:09.128
These were scary events for him.

5
00:00:09.318 --> 00:00:11.165
But as he matured into his adult years,

6
00:00:11.165 --> 00:00:13.404
he began to understand a much deeper context

7
00:00:13.464 --> 00:00:14.781
for these experiences.

8
00:00:14.957 --> 00:00:17.377
This hurdled him into a lifelong search

9
00:00:17.377 --> 00:00:19.864
for the truth behind extraterrestrial presence.

10
00:00:20.263 --> 00:00:23.179
He has since authored a book titled "The Divine Architect"

11
00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.402
and has been featured on CNN, Coast to Coast,

12
00:00:25.402 --> 00:00:28.045
and other networks because of the unique quality

13
00:00:28.045 --> 00:00:29.231
of his clairvoyance.

14
00:00:29.231 --> 00:00:31.372
Particularly around his broad understanding

15
00:00:31.372 --> 00:00:32.788
of this phenomena.

16
00:00:34.127 --> 00:00:35.796 line:15% 
(gentle music)

17
00:00:42.118 --> 00:00:44.478
<v Regina>Robert, you have a very rich</v>

18
00:00:44.478 --> 00:00:46.184
and deep history in the subject

19
00:00:46.184 --> 00:00:49.296
of studying extraterrestrial phenomena,

20
00:00:49.436 --> 00:00:51.242
and other phenomena as well.

21
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:53.701
I want to get into your broad overview of

22
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:55.665
where this whole movement toward,

23
00:00:56.035 --> 00:00:57.186
ultimately I suppose,

24
00:00:57.186 --> 00:00:59.026
disclosure or contact of some kind,

25
00:00:59.306 --> 00:01:00.668
has gone over the last few decades.

26
00:01:00.668 --> 00:01:02.150
First, let's talk about

27
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.063
how you ended up here.

28
00:01:04.492 --> 00:01:05.980
How'd you begin this journey?

29
00:01:06.673 --> 00:01:07.486
<v ->Interestingly enough,</v>

30
00:01:07.486 --> 00:01:09.190
when I was about 7 years old,

31
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.677
for some reason,

32
00:01:12.657 --> 00:01:14.495
I had the ability to see apparitions.

33
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:17.102
These are men and women like you and I

34
00:01:17.102 --> 00:01:19.182
who've simply benefitted from greater time

35
00:01:19.732 --> 00:01:20.894
and greater knowledge.

36
00:01:21.034 --> 00:01:22.955
At one time, I believe they probably lived here,

37
00:01:22.955 --> 00:01:23.882
even on Earth,

38
00:01:23.882 --> 00:01:25.927
and had gone through the natural cycle

39
00:01:25.927 --> 00:01:27.784
of being in the physical world like we do,

40
00:01:27.994 --> 00:01:29.391
finished out their cycle

41
00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:30.797
and then returned back to source.

42
00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:34.013
Many of them reappear

43
00:01:34.423 --> 00:01:35.982
into their reality here

44
00:01:35.982 --> 00:01:37.248
and see what they left.

45
00:01:37.248 --> 00:01:38.186
You might say that,

46
00:01:38.186 --> 00:01:39.295
just because you've died,

47
00:01:39.735 --> 00:01:40.893
doesn't mean you're exempt from

48
00:01:40.893 --> 00:01:42.258
the things that you've created.

49
00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:44.947
Therefore, you see things through.

50
00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:47.230
The parents who have died

51
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.656
see their children actually grow up.

52
00:01:49.656 --> 00:01:53.580
They see various family members become accomplished,

53
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.103
or maybe not accomplished,

54
00:01:55.103 --> 00:01:56.291
but they oversee that.

55
00:01:56.291 --> 00:01:58.011
It's the natural process

56
00:01:58.011 --> 00:01:59.561
that we're being fully connected,

57
00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:01.629
whether you're in the physical world or not.

58
00:02:02.447 --> 00:02:04.644
<v Regina>This started at a very young age with you?</v>

59
00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:06.948
<v ->Yeah. I was about 7 years old</v>

60
00:02:06.948 --> 00:02:09.006
and I told my mom that there were,

61
00:02:09.956 --> 00:02:11.353
what they call full-torso,

62
00:02:11.543 --> 00:02:12.847
semiatheric apparitions.

63
00:02:12.847 --> 00:02:14.875
These are just what they might call ghosts.

64
00:02:15.095 --> 00:02:16.212
People like you and I,

65
00:02:16.212 --> 00:02:17.810
that just don't have a physical body,

66
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.365
but still retain the form.

67
00:02:20.745 --> 00:02:22.084
At first we didn't know what it was.

68
00:02:22.454 --> 00:02:24.601
My mother was fascinated by it.

69
00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:27.444
She was looking at it and thinking,

70
00:02:27.444 --> 00:02:29.691
"Well, we have a little clairvoyance in the family."

71
00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:31.287
<v Regina>That turned out to be true,</v>

72
00:02:31.287 --> 00:02:32.119
didn't it?

73
00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:34.197
<v ->It did but from her standing-point,</v>

74
00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:35.951
I said,

75
00:02:35.951 --> 00:02:36.993
"How do you feel about that?"

76
00:02:37.003 --> 00:02:37.870
She said,

77
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.829
"We're going to be rich."

78
00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:39.757
(laughs)

79
00:02:40.817 --> 00:02:41.483
Because she thought ...

80
00:02:41.483 --> 00:02:42.649
<v Regina>Oh, you were going to become a sideshow.</v>

81
00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:44.185
<v ->She thought I would become her sideshow.</v>

82
00:02:44.185 --> 00:02:45.241
But in fact,

83
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:46.366
it was a phenomena.

84
00:02:46.692 --> 00:02:47.663
You have to remember,

85
00:02:47.663 --> 00:02:50.745
this was the early 60's. 66.

86
00:02:51.328 --> 00:02:53.318
People in those days really didn't know

87
00:02:53.318 --> 00:02:54.339
about this kind of stuff.

88
00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:57.810
We just knew it was a phenomena that existed.

89
00:02:57.903 --> 00:02:59.957
Even I had report cards coming home

90
00:03:00.687 --> 00:03:02.761
from teachers that actually wrote on the back,

91
00:03:02.761 --> 00:03:05.460
"Robert says he sees people standing behind people."

92
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.388
And says,

93
00:03:06.388 --> 00:03:07.967
"This disturbs the class."

94
00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:13.235
The movie "The Sixth Sense" came out in 1999.

95
00:03:14.075 --> 00:03:15.549
That was at the peak of

96
00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:16.732
when my first book,

97
00:03:16.732 --> 00:03:18.089
"The Divine Blueprint" came out.

98
00:03:19.004 --> 00:03:20.796
That's what spawned that idea of,

99
00:03:21.336 --> 00:03:22.559
I wasn't compared

100
00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.069
completely to the boy,

101
00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:26.476
but the media picked up on it

102
00:03:26.476 --> 00:03:28.168
because I could see what they call "dead people".

103
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.450
<v Regina>Right.</v>
<v ->Interestingly enough,</v>

104
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.949
they're actually more alive than we are.

105
00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:32.103
We're actually the dead ones

106
00:03:32.103 --> 00:03:33.284
and they're the ones that are more alive.

107
00:03:33.284 --> 00:03:35.100
<v Regina>Interesting. Okay.</v>

108
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.204
I guess we could talk for hours about that.

109
00:03:37.954 --> 00:03:39.582
Let's progress into the whole subject

110
00:03:39.582 --> 00:03:40.820
of extraterrestrials,

111
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.303
all planet civilizations,

112
00:03:42.303 --> 00:03:44.342
and how you became plugged into this

113
00:03:44.342 --> 00:03:45.697
because you're not that old

114
00:03:45.697 --> 00:03:47.644
and you've been plugged in a really long time.

115
00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:48.918
<v ->Yeah.</v>

116
00:03:49.767 --> 00:03:51.409
In 1977,

117
00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.677
I had what was termed at that time,

118
00:03:54.677 --> 00:03:55.734
because of the movie,

119
00:03:55.734 --> 00:03:56.833
also coining the phrase,

120
00:03:56.833 --> 00:03:58.003
a close encounter.

121
00:03:58.003 --> 00:03:58.924
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->A close encounter</v>

122
00:03:58.924 --> 00:04:00.248
with something very unusual.

123
00:04:00.788 --> 00:04:02.535
I was in the California, Nevada border.

124
00:04:02.852 --> 00:04:04.599
This is in the area of ...

125
00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:07.207
Lake Tahoe.

126
00:04:07.207 --> 00:04:08.700
What's called "Heavenly Valley"

127
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.804
of all things, right?

128
00:04:09.804 --> 00:04:11.181
<v Regina>Yes. I used to live at the lake.</v>

129
00:04:11.181 --> 00:04:11.999
<v ->Oh, great.</v>

130
00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:12.917
Beautiful place.

131
00:04:14.427 --> 00:04:16.051
In the middle of the night,

132
00:04:17.554 --> 00:04:19.645
mysteriously out of nothing,

133
00:04:19.915 --> 00:04:22.125
literally materialized what looked like

134
00:04:23.325 --> 00:04:26.258
three 8 1/2 foot tall cosmonauts

135
00:04:26.398 --> 00:04:29.110
of some kind in an arching storm.

136
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:30.770
Suddenly I was startled awake

137
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.050
at what sounded like a freight train,

138
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.889
almost, going through the living room.

139
00:04:34.163 --> 00:04:35.974
Suddenly, three of these things

140
00:04:36.513 --> 00:04:39.440
literally beamed into the house.

141
00:04:40.374 --> 00:04:42.255
The mind really doesn't have room for that.

142
00:04:42.605 --> 00:04:44.164
Your mind really doesn't have room for that.

143
00:04:45.464 --> 00:04:46.498
I wasn't asking,

144
00:04:46.498 --> 00:04:47.368
"What is this?"

145
00:04:47.488 --> 00:04:48.377
No. I was

146
00:04:48.517 --> 00:04:49.606
in complete utter state of shock.

147
00:04:49.606 --> 00:04:51.789
In fact, you're almost frozen in this state

148
00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.368
where the only thing you can hear is just your conciousness

149
00:04:54.448 --> 00:04:56.768
but your body is actually frozen somehow.

150
00:04:56.768 --> 00:04:57.729
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

151
00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.628
<v ->There's this inner person inside me screaming</v>

152
00:05:00.628 --> 00:05:01.970
and looking at these things,

153
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.171
not knowing what it was.

154
00:05:03.171 --> 00:05:04.613
<v Regina>It creates such an incoherence.</v>

155
00:05:04.613 --> 00:05:05.863
There's no way to respond.

156
00:05:05.993 --> 00:05:07.567
It's like a paralasis sometimes.

157
00:05:07.567 --> 00:05:10.949
<v ->It's a paralysis and there's no negotiation with it.</v>

158
00:05:11.184 --> 00:05:13.631
You're just going to go along with whatever this is.

159
00:05:14.434 --> 00:05:16.403
Somehow they had the ability

160
00:05:16.403 --> 00:05:18.337
to open up the side of the house,

161
00:05:18.637 --> 00:05:20.325
in what looked like a swirling,

162
00:05:20.325 --> 00:05:22.544
multicolored vortex of some sort.

163
00:05:23.124 --> 00:05:24.415
It's a bit like Jodie Foster

164
00:05:24.415 --> 00:05:25.876
in the movie "Contact".
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

165
00:05:25.876 --> 00:05:27.465
I remember that scene.
<v ->Where you see this</v>

166
00:05:27.695 --> 00:05:28.695
tunnel open up

167
00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:30.775
and suddenly you're hurling through it at hundreds,

168
00:05:31.065 --> 00:05:32.825
it felt like thousands of miles an hour

169
00:05:32.825 --> 00:05:34.209
and it burned very badly.

170
00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:37.065
The next thing I knew I was standing

171
00:05:37.655 --> 00:05:39.855
in some kind of dimly lit room.

172
00:05:41.265 --> 00:05:43.455
All I could hear were voices in the room

173
00:05:43.665 --> 00:05:46.118
that didn't sound anything like I'd ever heard.

174
00:05:46.118 --> 00:05:48.532
No sense of English

175
00:05:48.532 --> 00:05:50.102
or a language I've ever heard before.

176
00:05:51.222 --> 00:05:54.512
Interfaced with some kind of glass-like object

177
00:05:55.152 --> 00:05:57.851
and then went back through the tunnel vortex

178
00:05:57.851 --> 00:06:00.160
and then was lowered back down to my bed.

179
00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:04.424
Then these mysterious visitors,

180
00:06:05.624 --> 00:06:07.595
they looked like cosmonauts of some sort.

181
00:06:07.595 --> 00:06:08.896
Silver space suits,

182
00:06:09.506 --> 00:06:11.675
a visor across the face,

183
00:06:12.395 --> 00:06:13.615
like an orange antenna.

184
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.325
Then suddenly this disappears

185
00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:20.934
and I was in a state of shock

186
00:06:20.934 --> 00:06:22.530
for about three hours probably.

187
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.402
Pulled myself out of bed,

188
00:06:24.402 --> 00:06:26.216
went to the bathroom,

189
00:06:26.216 --> 00:06:29.279
pulled myself up on to the bathroom sink

190
00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:30.592
and turned on the light.

191
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.132
I was completely sunburned from head to toe.

192
00:06:34.302 --> 00:06:35.321
I was soaked in,

193
00:06:35.321 --> 00:06:37.452
like a honey or an oil material.

194
00:06:40.587 --> 00:06:41.662
I had two black eyes.

195
00:06:41.662 --> 00:06:44.280
Probably from state of shock.

196
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.736
My hair was matted back

197
00:06:45.736 --> 00:06:47.767
and I was literally soaked in something.

198
00:06:49.762 --> 00:06:51.152
I had no idea what it was.

199
00:06:52.638 --> 00:06:53.705
The next three months,

200
00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:55.486
I locked myself in my apartment

201
00:06:56.346 --> 00:06:58.185
and I didn't speak about it to anybody

202
00:06:58.185 --> 00:07:00.782
because I didn't understand what it was.

203
00:07:01.214 --> 00:07:02.631
<v Regina>Were you frightened?</v>

204
00:07:03.312 --> 00:07:04.582
<v ->I was--
<v Regina>Or just perplexed?</v>

205
00:07:04.582 --> 00:07:05.607
<v ->terrified at first.</v>

206
00:07:05.607 --> 00:07:07.399
I was terrified because I didn't know

207
00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:08.765
anything like that existed.

208
00:07:08.765 --> 00:07:10.072
I didn't know what it was.

209
00:07:10.963 --> 00:07:12.104
Eventually,

210
00:07:13.424 --> 00:07:15.853
as I started to examine it closer,

211
00:07:15.853 --> 00:07:18.942
I started to just get interested in metaphysical matters.

212
00:07:18.976 --> 00:07:20.602
Knowing that I had seen apparitions

213
00:07:20.602 --> 00:07:21.734
when I was a child

214
00:07:21.734 --> 00:07:23.291
and knowing I had a family,

215
00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:26.213
a mother that was very interested in metaphysics.

216
00:07:27.483 --> 00:07:29.224
Later on, people like Shirey MacLaine who,

217
00:07:29.224 --> 00:07:31.628
way showers. Et cetera. Et cetera.

218
00:07:34.077 --> 00:07:37.212
I found that this is some kind of close encounter

219
00:07:37.212 --> 00:07:38.605
with something very unusual.

220
00:07:38.645 --> 00:07:39.397
In fact, I thought

221
00:07:39.397 --> 00:07:41.385
maybe angels come in space suits.

222
00:07:42.805 --> 00:07:43.596
<v Regina>When you were going through</v>

223
00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:45.416
this experience when you were taken into this room,

224
00:07:45.426 --> 00:07:47.002
and heard the voices,

225
00:07:47.002 --> 00:07:47.834
were you frightened

226
00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:51.497
or were you in a state of dissorientation

227
00:07:51.507 --> 00:07:53.434
or paralysis on some level?

228
00:07:53.434 --> 00:07:55.432
<v ->All of the above.</v>

229
00:07:55.432 --> 00:07:57.284
I threw up over the side of the bed

230
00:07:57.284 --> 00:07:58.863
when it first happened.

231
00:08:01.563 --> 00:08:02.868
Some of me was trembling,

232
00:08:02.868 --> 00:08:03.819
almost uncontrollably.

233
00:08:06.229 --> 00:08:08.065
Then it was almost like,

234
00:08:08.065 --> 00:08:10.075
you know how your mind has a flashed image?

235
00:08:10.649 --> 00:08:13.625
Where I can still see it happening.

236
00:08:13.625 --> 00:08:15.093
Almost as though you're having

237
00:08:15.213 --> 00:08:17.386
a flashback of some sort.

238
00:08:17.386 --> 00:08:20.369
There also was something very unusual

239
00:08:20.369 --> 00:08:21.414
that I couldn't explain.

240
00:08:21.414 --> 00:08:23.110
That was that,

241
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.388
when I closed my eyes for about the first hour,

242
00:08:25.388 --> 00:08:28.961
I seem to be able to see around the room.

243
00:08:28.961 --> 00:08:30.700
All the way around,

244
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:31.446
even through the back of my head.

245
00:08:31.446 --> 00:08:35.489
In the 360 panaramic view.

246
00:08:35.489 --> 00:08:36.993
<v Regina>Your senses were opened up a wee bit?</v>

247
00:08:36.993 --> 00:08:38.336
<v ->Yeah. I had no idea what this was.</v>

248
00:08:38.336 --> 00:08:40.107
I closed my eyes and I could see behind me,

249
00:08:40.107 --> 00:08:41.014
and I thought,

250
00:08:41.014 --> 00:08:43.637
"Is this what insanity feels like?"

251
00:08:44.651 --> 00:08:46.543
<v Regina>Or expanded awareness.</v>

252
00:08:47.371 --> 00:08:48.171
<v ->Yes.</v>

253
00:08:48.171 --> 00:08:49.770
Something changed me forever that night.

254
00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:52.028
I didn't know that,

255
00:08:52.028 --> 00:08:52.429
at that point,

256
00:08:52.429 --> 00:08:55.170
it would lead me to a 30 year reasearch

257
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.428
into the esoteric,

258
00:08:56.428 --> 00:08:58.305
the mystery schools,

259
00:08:58.305 --> 00:09:00.417
all the phenomenal aspects of the human experience.

260
00:09:01.227 --> 00:09:02.171
UFO's, angels.

261
00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:02.931
<v Regina>It certainly sounds like</v>

262
00:09:02.931 --> 00:09:04.439
it was an invitation.

263
00:09:04.439 --> 00:09:06.412
After you locked yourself away for three months,

264
00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:09.090
what did you do?

265
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:14.090
<v ->I had first run into a magazine in a book store</v>

266
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.932
called "UFO Magazine."

267
00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:19.830
It was still existing back then.

268
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:20.396
<v Regina>Right.</v>

269
00:09:20.396 --> 00:09:22.155
<v ->To my astonishment,</v>

270
00:09:22.155 --> 00:09:24.086
and I can actually show you the photograph too.

271
00:09:24.086 --> 00:09:25.313
I don't have it here right now.

272
00:09:25.313 --> 00:09:26.944
Perhaps we can show it at some time.

273
00:09:28.904 --> 00:09:31.205
To my astonishment,

274
00:09:31.205 --> 00:09:32.235
I opened up the magazine

275
00:09:32.235 --> 00:09:33.610
and there was a photo of one of them.

276
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.792
You fall over when you see something like that.

277
00:09:36.819 --> 00:09:38.057
"Oh, my God.

278
00:09:38.057 --> 00:09:38.985
"Somebody has a photo of this.

279
00:09:38.985 --> 00:09:40.286
"That's impossible."

280
00:09:40.286 --> 00:09:41.278
<v Regina>What was it?</v>

281
00:09:41.278 --> 00:09:43.251
<v ->It shows a black and white photo</v>

282
00:09:43.251 --> 00:09:45.416
of what looks like a cosmonaut of some sort.

283
00:09:45.416 --> 00:09:47.432
Silver space suit that's illumined.

284
00:09:47.432 --> 00:09:50.173
Almost like mittens and the visor.

285
00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:52.284
You see what was left of a little bit antenna.

286
00:09:52.284 --> 00:09:54.536
You're only seeing about 10% about what's there.

287
00:09:57.106 --> 00:10:02.106
It was shot by a guy named Jeff Greenhaw in 1973.

288
00:10:02.234 --> 00:10:06.127
He was a police officer in Falkville, Alabama.

289
00:10:06.127 --> 00:10:09.572
He took a couple of photos of the same thing.

290
00:10:09.572 --> 00:10:11.748
When I saw it, I thought,

291
00:10:11.748 --> 00:10:12.590
"That's impossible.

292
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.073
"I know the shape,

293
00:10:14.073 --> 00:10:15.140
"I know the image."

294
00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:18.233
The flashes of blue lightning that came off the suit,

295
00:10:18.233 --> 00:10:21.177
the multicolored fantastic ora that it presented

296
00:10:21.177 --> 00:10:23.384
almost as though the sun had touched down

297
00:10:23.384 --> 00:10:24.771
in the middle of the night.

298
00:10:24.771 --> 00:10:27.491
That wasn't devident because the photo's so washed out

299
00:10:27.491 --> 00:10:30.413
but the shape was unmistakable.

300
00:10:30.413 --> 00:10:32.760
<v Regina>Okay. Now,</v>

301
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.552
you've had a little bit of validation.

302
00:10:34.552 --> 00:10:37.432
What did that launch you to,

303
00:10:37.432 --> 00:10:39.799
in terms of your investigations?

304
00:10:39.799 --> 00:10:42.445
Because you know all these people here

305
00:10:43.955 --> 00:10:45.122
and have for many years.

306
00:10:45.122 --> 00:10:48.183
<v ->Yeah. I know the UFO community very well.</v>

307
00:10:48.183 --> 00:10:49.409
Very lovely friends.

308
00:10:49.409 --> 00:10:51.244
They've been my mentors and my teachers,

309
00:10:51.244 --> 00:10:51.885
as well.

310
00:10:52.755 --> 00:10:55.065
I ran into a woman...

311
00:10:55.065 --> 00:10:57.732
I first read a book by Brad Steiger called Alien Meetings.

312
00:10:57.732 --> 00:10:59.844
I took it home and I read it from cover to cover,

313
00:10:59.844 --> 00:11:00.814
until all of a sudden,

314
00:11:00.814 --> 00:11:05.113
I saw a chapter in there

315
00:11:05.113 --> 00:11:07.321
called "Angels in Space Suits."

316
00:11:07.321 --> 00:11:09.059
There I read a story

317
00:11:09.059 --> 00:11:11.384
of a woman named Clarissa Bernhardt who,

318
00:11:11.384 --> 00:11:13.027
at the time was known as the Earthquake Lady.

319
00:11:13.027 --> 00:11:14.424
She had made many predictions.

320
00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:16.611
She was a clairvoyant.

321
00:11:16.611 --> 00:11:18.861
I read her story and she described

322
00:11:18.861 --> 00:11:21.624
three mysterious, silver cosmonauts,

323
00:11:21.624 --> 00:11:23.405
about 8 1/2 foot tall.

324
00:11:23.405 --> 00:11:24.226
(laughs)

325
00:11:24.226 --> 00:11:25.336
I'm reading this,

326
00:11:25.336 --> 00:11:26.914
and she's based in San Jose,

327
00:11:26.914 --> 00:11:27.938
I thought,

328
00:11:27.938 --> 00:11:28.845
"Incredible!"

329
00:11:28.845 --> 00:11:29.933
I called her.

330
00:11:29.933 --> 00:11:32.930
I spoke to her husband for two hours

331
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:33.559
and he said,

332
00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:36.087
"You're one of the only ones

333
00:11:36.087 --> 00:11:37.431
"that have ever phoned here

334
00:11:37.431 --> 00:11:39.681
"that said you've seen this exact same thing.

335
00:11:39.681 --> 00:11:41.356
"Let me give you an appointment,

336
00:11:41.356 --> 00:11:43.404
"tomorrow afternoon with her.

337
00:11:43.404 --> 00:11:45.025
"Clarissa, I'm sure,

338
00:11:45.025 --> 00:11:46.817
"wants to meet you right away."

339
00:11:46.817 --> 00:11:48.715
Because there were very few people that had ever seen it.

340
00:11:50.245 --> 00:11:52.854
<v Regina>What happened at this meeting?</v>

341
00:11:52.854 --> 00:11:54.646
What came out of this?

342
00:11:54.646 --> 00:11:56.288
Obviously, you had your validation

343
00:11:56.288 --> 00:11:57.590
that you weren't insane.

344
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:58.496
<v ->No.</v>

345
00:11:58.496 --> 00:11:59.755
<v Regina>Let me ask you a question.</v>

346
00:11:59.755 --> 00:12:00.960
The experience you had,

347
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.443
is that what you would refer to,

348
00:12:02.443 --> 00:12:04.021
or another person might refer to,

349
00:12:04.021 --> 00:12:07.274
as an abduction or contact?

350
00:12:08.484 --> 00:12:12.072
<v ->I would say it would be both.</v>

351
00:12:12.072 --> 00:12:13.768
I don't usually,

352
00:12:13.768 --> 00:12:14.696
in my own lectures,

353
00:12:14.696 --> 00:12:16.136
like to use the word "abduction."

354
00:12:16.136 --> 00:12:18.781
Although, I think that that definitely exists for people.

355
00:12:18.781 --> 00:12:21.266
I think these grey characters,

356
00:12:21.266 --> 00:12:23.037
that people claim they see,

357
00:12:23.037 --> 00:12:25.308
have taken them against their will,

358
00:12:25.308 --> 00:12:26.396
I'd call that abduction.

359
00:12:26.396 --> 00:12:28.487
Just like we it have here with people.

360
00:12:28.487 --> 00:12:29.788
<v Regina>How do you differentiate</v>

361
00:12:29.788 --> 00:12:31.975
between that and what happened with you?

362
00:12:31.975 --> 00:12:33.617
<v ->I don't know that you can.</v>

363
00:12:33.617 --> 00:12:34.247
<v Regina>Aside the fact</v>

364
00:12:34.247 --> 00:12:36.102
that nothing terrible happened when you went.

365
00:12:36.102 --> 00:12:37.756
Obviously, you weren't prodded.

366
00:12:39.536 --> 00:12:40.988
<v ->I don't know that you can really say,</v>

367
00:12:40.988 --> 00:12:42.257
for sure, what it was.

368
00:12:42.257 --> 00:12:43.515
Ultimately,

369
00:12:43.515 --> 00:12:45.350
it turns out to be a very good experience.

370
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:46.374
<v Regina>Yes. Okay.</v>

371
00:12:46.374 --> 00:12:48.411
<v ->You know, that has changed and gone in directions</v>

372
00:12:48.411 --> 00:12:51.536
that I never thought possible.

373
00:12:51.536 --> 00:12:53.691
That's a nice thing.

374
00:12:53.691 --> 00:12:55.131
<v Regina>Has it happened since?</v>

375
00:12:55.131 --> 00:12:56.848
<v ->Never saw them again.</v>

376
00:12:56.848 --> 00:12:58.010
<v Regina>That was your invitation,</v>

377
00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:58.992
your opening?

378
00:12:58.992 --> 00:13:00.442
<v ->You know, Regina,</v>

379
00:13:00.442 --> 00:13:02.970
as much as something like that makes an indellable imprint

380
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:03.941
in your memory,

381
00:13:03.941 --> 00:13:06.842
I've never had one dream about them since.

382
00:13:06.842 --> 00:13:08.026
I have never

383
00:13:10.526 --> 00:13:13.007
had any sensation of them whatsoever.

384
00:13:13.007 --> 00:13:14.073
Since then,

385
00:13:14.073 --> 00:13:16.356
I've seen many, many, many other things.

386
00:13:16.356 --> 00:13:18.788
Yes. I see other people standing behind people

387
00:13:18.788 --> 00:13:19.769
on a regular basis.

388
00:13:19.769 --> 00:13:23.758
I don't consider myself an extraordinary clairvoyant.

389
00:13:23.758 --> 00:13:25.550
I don't do readings for people.

390
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.470
I don't sell myself as a messenger.

391
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:28.377
Although, I know,

392
00:13:28.377 --> 00:13:30.211
yes, some people might use that term.

393
00:13:30.211 --> 00:13:33.048
I like to think of myself as a spiritual reporter

394
00:13:33.048 --> 00:13:36.067
who has just been prodded or moved

395
00:13:36.067 --> 00:13:39.591
to find important aspects that effect us all.

396
00:13:40.898 --> 00:13:43.458
<v Regina>Let's do the historical overview</v>

397
00:13:43.458 --> 00:13:44.642
from this, then,

398
00:13:44.642 --> 00:13:46.658
bceause you have quite a broad perspective

399
00:13:46.658 --> 00:13:49.837
of the whole movement of the revelation

400
00:13:49.837 --> 00:13:51.804
that there's more than meets the eye.

401
00:13:51.874 --> 00:13:55.127
From UFO congresses way back,

402
00:13:55.127 --> 00:13:56.727
a decade or two back,

403
00:13:56.727 --> 00:13:57.964
which is before most people here

404
00:13:57.964 --> 00:13:59.799
had ever even heard of such a thing.

405
00:13:59.799 --> 00:14:00.934
<v ->Right.</v>

406
00:14:00.934 --> 00:14:04.193
<v Regina>What have you seen as the progression</v>

407
00:14:04.193 --> 00:14:08.278
of the way this subject has been treated

408
00:14:08.278 --> 00:14:11.531
and is being unveiled to the public through the years?

409
00:14:11.531 --> 00:14:13.152
Are there patterns,

410
00:14:13.152 --> 00:14:15.610
like a sine wave of some kind,

411
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:16.314
that you've seen?

412
00:14:16.896 --> 00:14:18.261
<v ->Yeah. Interestingly enough,</v>

413
00:14:18.261 --> 00:14:19.989
over the last 25 years,

414
00:14:19.989 --> 00:14:22.304
first it was nuts and bolts.

415
00:14:22.304 --> 00:14:23.882
It was UFO expos.

416
00:14:23.882 --> 00:14:25.184
In fact, I go back to,

417
00:14:25.184 --> 00:14:26.837
as I said to Robert Dean--
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

418
00:14:26.837 --> 00:14:28.437
<v ->there 25 years ago. More.</v>

419
00:14:28.437 --> 00:14:30.845
30 years ago. 1978.

420
00:14:30.845 --> 00:14:34.911
It was all about the phenomena of the craft.

421
00:14:34.911 --> 00:14:36.607
Then, eventually,

422
00:14:36.607 --> 00:14:38.442
as we recorded more information,

423
00:14:38.442 --> 00:14:40.297
when the community recorded more information,

424
00:14:40.297 --> 00:14:42.836
it started getting into the nature of the contact

425
00:14:42.836 --> 00:14:44.756
and the dynamics of the contact.

426
00:14:44.756 --> 00:14:46.569
We started seeing similarity.

427
00:14:46.569 --> 00:14:49.779
Then the consciousness movement started to come in.

428
00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:52.819
This would be really an explosion

429
00:14:52.819 --> 00:14:54.579
that probably happened around '87

430
00:14:54.579 --> 00:14:57.022
in what was called a Harmonic Convergence.

431
00:14:57.022 --> 00:14:59.965
Suddenly, you see the publishing industry flourish

432
00:14:59.965 --> 00:15:03.528
with deeper reports about the concious awareness movements

433
00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:06.269
and more of the psychic and metaphysical.

434
00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:08.616
The mysticical and the clairvoyant aspects started

435
00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:10.408
to take a real hold.

436
00:15:10.408 --> 00:15:11.677
<v Regina>Of contact and such?</v>

437
00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:12.978
<v ->Of contact--
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

438
00:15:12.978 --> 00:15:14.909
<v ->and that it became more like</v>

439
00:15:14.909 --> 00:15:18.002
you could study the nuts and bolts of the phenomena

440
00:15:18.002 --> 00:15:20.572
or you could also listen to the information

441
00:15:20.572 --> 00:15:23.825
that might have been imparted by the encounter.

442
00:15:23.825 --> 00:15:25.916
That became fascinating and then moved

443
00:15:25.916 --> 00:15:27.793
into more of the channeled material.

444
00:15:27.793 --> 00:15:29.564
Channeled material has existed

445
00:15:29.564 --> 00:15:31.206
long before--
<v Regina>Right.</v>

446
00:15:31.206 --> 00:15:32.422
<v ->Alice Bailey.
<v Regina>Right. Right.</v>

447
00:15:32.422 --> 00:15:33.947
<v ->Long before all of these--</v>

448
00:15:33.947 --> 00:15:35.185
<v Regina>Since we've been here.</v>

449
00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:36.966
<v ->others. Yeah. So it's been here.</v>

450
00:15:36.966 --> 00:15:39.110
It's seemed to have taken a hold more.

451
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.403
Something we know as having at a concious level

452
00:15:41.403 --> 00:15:44.219
where more and more people are actually

453
00:15:44.219 --> 00:15:46.373
having more direct contact.

454
00:15:46.373 --> 00:15:49.722
Then there's this feeling that it's part of the evolution

455
00:15:49.722 --> 00:15:52.997
that maybe some of us are slowly being integrated.

456
00:15:52.997 --> 00:15:55.759
Or there's almost like a blend that is happening.

457
00:15:55.759 --> 00:15:57.477
<v Regina>Is this what's happening in the 2000's now?</v>

458
00:15:57.477 --> 00:15:59.034
That you're saying since 2000?

459
00:15:59.034 --> 00:16:00.239
<v ->Yeah. Very much so.</v>

460
00:16:00.239 --> 00:16:01.636
<v Regina>That there's more of a blend?</v>

461
00:16:01.636 --> 00:16:04.516
<v ->There's a definite bleed-through and a blend where,</v>

462
00:16:04.516 --> 00:16:05.839
well you remember in the old days

463
00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:08.153
they would reunite the person who was lost

464
00:16:08.153 --> 00:16:10.105
from their mother 13 years ago

465
00:16:10.105 --> 00:16:11.566
and they would reunite them--
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

466
00:16:11.566 --> 00:16:13.337
<v ->on the major television--
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

467
00:16:13.337 --> 00:16:14.723
<v ->shows with an audience cheering them on</v>

468
00:16:14.723 --> 00:16:16.121
that they finally got together.

469
00:16:16.121 --> 00:16:16.867
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

470
00:16:16.867 --> 00:16:17.859
<v ->Now we have guys,</v>

471
00:16:17.859 --> 00:16:19.043
a wonderful friend like John Edward,

472
00:16:19.043 --> 00:16:22.595
and everything, who now reunites the dead mother

473
00:16:22.595 --> 00:16:24.344
of 13 years ago.
<v Regina>Yes. Yes.</v>

474
00:16:24.344 --> 00:16:25.197
Who then,

475
00:16:25.197 --> 00:16:25.805
"Guess what?

476
00:16:25.805 --> 00:16:28.376
"She's here today and she's coming through me."

477
00:16:28.376 --> 00:16:31.842
That's accepted in the mainstream media

478
00:16:31.842 --> 00:16:33.560
that talking to the dead,

479
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.042
meeting extraterrestrials,

480
00:16:35.042 --> 00:16:36.621
angelic visitations,

481
00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:38.434
telepathic information,

482
00:16:38.434 --> 00:16:40.173
wisdom being brought through

483
00:16:40.173 --> 00:16:42.871
seems to become more acceptable.

484
00:16:42.871 --> 00:16:44.546
I think we may be moving towards--

485
00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:45.516
<v Regina>It's moved more from technology</v>

486
00:16:45.516 --> 00:16:46.465
to consciousness?

487
00:16:46.465 --> 00:16:48.119
<v ->Yeah. Consciousness and not only that.</v>

488
00:16:50.579 --> 00:16:51.201
That we're becoming,

489
00:16:51.201 --> 00:16:53.174
somewhat of a telepathic society.

490
00:16:53.174 --> 00:16:55.574
Maybe the Sanskrit was right after all.

491
00:16:55.574 --> 00:16:57.910
Even the Bible had made references

492
00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.513
about the merging of Heaven and Earth.

493
00:17:00.513 --> 00:17:02.347
Maybe these things are starting

494
00:17:02.347 --> 00:17:04.160
to really take hold now.

495
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.603
You can see this really unfolding.

496
00:17:06.603 --> 00:17:07.712
<v Regina>You can.</v>

497
00:17:07.712 --> 00:17:09.173
You've been talking with Bob Dean.

498
00:17:09.173 --> 00:17:11.893
You can see the real merging

499
00:17:11.893 --> 00:17:14.240
of the conciousness.

500
00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.125
As he says,

501
00:17:15.125 --> 00:17:16.906
the theological implications of this

502
00:17:16.906 --> 00:17:18.346
are what fascinate him,

503
00:17:18.346 --> 00:17:19.530
for example.

504
00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:22.229
We're all under some larger influence.

505
00:17:22.229 --> 00:17:24.874
No matter whether you're extraterrestiral off-planet

506
00:17:24.874 --> 00:17:26.911
or third dimensional in nature,

507
00:17:26.911 --> 00:17:27.540
right?

508
00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.791
It does seem that a lot more of that kind of information

509
00:17:29.791 --> 00:17:30.953
is popping through.

510
00:17:30.953 --> 00:17:33.737
Now, you have your own vision,

511
00:17:33.737 --> 00:17:35.390
internal vision,

512
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:36.713
on a lot of this.

513
00:17:36.713 --> 00:17:39.124
Let's talk about where,

514
00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:42.377
what you're seeing as a progression,

515
00:17:42.377 --> 00:17:44.979
through your own internal lens now for humanity.

516
00:17:49.609 --> 00:17:50.323
<v ->For thousands of years,</v>

517
00:17:50.323 --> 00:17:55.016
that's been talked about that Heaven would merge with Earth.

518
00:17:55.016 --> 00:17:58.408
The dead would rise and the angels would return.

519
00:17:58.408 --> 00:18:00.936
That the wheat would be separated from the chaff.

520
00:18:00.936 --> 00:18:03.122
These are things we've been hearing about in the Bible.

521
00:18:03.122 --> 00:18:05.927
Maybe they're symbolic references

522
00:18:05.927 --> 00:18:09.084
that the darker aspect of our experience

523
00:18:09.084 --> 00:18:11.239
is beginning to be separated away.

524
00:18:11.239 --> 00:18:13.425
You see this devision,

525
00:18:14.365 --> 00:18:16.007
this balance,

526
00:18:16.007 --> 00:18:18.054
this separation is beginning to happen.

527
00:18:18.054 --> 00:18:20.241
The lighter wisdom aspect

528
00:18:20.241 --> 00:18:22.694
is becoming even increased exponentially for some.

529
00:18:22.694 --> 00:18:25.531
While the darker aspects of our experience are even,

530
00:18:25.531 --> 00:18:27.174
they're becoming more darker.

531
00:18:27.174 --> 00:18:29.456
Hence, you see in North America

532
00:18:29.456 --> 00:18:32.006
that it's very divided on how it feels

533
00:18:32.006 --> 00:18:33.979
about it's directives.

534
00:18:33.979 --> 00:18:36.208
The war in Iraq,

535
00:18:36.208 --> 00:18:38.928
the war in the Middle East becomes more heated

536
00:18:38.928 --> 00:18:42.714
and intenstive as they hold to exisiting belief systems

537
00:18:42.714 --> 00:18:44.687
that may not serve them.

538
00:18:44.687 --> 00:18:49.146
Such as the Old World is holding people back,

539
00:18:49.146 --> 00:18:50.607
to a certain degree,

540
00:18:50.607 --> 00:18:53.860
with belief systems that are not serving.

541
00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.921
Women's rights. This kind of thing.

542
00:18:56.921 --> 00:19:01.198
Believing that the future is supposed to unfold

543
00:19:01.198 --> 00:19:03.684
and is already written in a very certain way.

544
00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:04.772
Whereas, all of a sudden,

545
00:19:04.772 --> 00:19:08.505
you also see the New Age movement being birthed.

546
00:19:08.505 --> 00:19:09.806
You see this, actually,

547
00:19:09.806 --> 00:19:11.523
in 1967 when the Beatles

548
00:19:11.523 --> 00:19:13.740
went to see Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

549
00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.456
<v Regina>Right.</v>

550
00:19:14.456 --> 00:19:19.456
<v ->I've had the pleasure to briefly meet Paul McCartney</v>

551
00:19:19.864 --> 00:19:24.864
and listen to what he was saying about the fact

552
00:19:25.624 --> 00:19:27.533
that that summer was the birth,

553
00:19:27.533 --> 00:19:29.826
even though it's called The Flower Power Era,

554
00:19:29.826 --> 00:19:31.181
The Summer of Love.

555
00:19:31.181 --> 00:19:32.194
If you look at that today,

556
00:19:32.194 --> 00:19:33.687
you take that out 30 years,

557
00:19:33.687 --> 00:19:35.468
and you actually see that that birthed ifself

558
00:19:35.468 --> 00:19:36.674
into what's, today,

559
00:19:36.674 --> 00:19:37.751
called The New Age Movement.

560
00:19:37.751 --> 00:19:38.625
Or the--
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

561
00:19:38.625 --> 00:19:41.900
the allowance that we can have mudras, mantras,

562
00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.969
metaphysics, mystisisim

563
00:19:43.969 --> 00:19:46.134
cosmic consciousness that we can embrace it all.

564
00:19:46.134 --> 00:19:49.291
Whether it be Hinduism,

565
00:19:49.291 --> 00:19:51.297
Buddhism, Christianity,

566
00:19:51.297 --> 00:19:55.179
that maybe they're all parts to the puzzle

567
00:19:55.179 --> 00:19:56.406
rather than any one of them

568
00:19:56.406 --> 00:19:58.358
having a real copyright on the absolute.

569
00:20:00.588 --> 00:20:02.357
<v Regina>From where you sit,</v>

570
00:20:02.357 --> 00:20:03.818
with what you've seen happen,

571
00:20:03.818 --> 00:20:05.450
this weekend for example,

572
00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:06.773
with all these presenters,

573
00:20:06.773 --> 00:20:09.717
what are you seeing as the great opportunity here now?

574
00:20:09.717 --> 00:20:13.610
Bringing everyone together in this Bay Area UFO Expo.

575
00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:14.580
<v ->Yeah.</v>

576
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.300
We started this 10 years ago

577
00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.927
and it started out one way with a very nuts and bolts thing.

578
00:20:20.927 --> 00:20:25.403
Then we saw that the public was coming out

579
00:20:26.953 --> 00:20:28.670
and asking deeper questions.

580
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.433
Also, it was a ground where people would come out

581
00:20:31.433 --> 00:20:34.238
and sort of come out of the closet,

582
00:20:34.238 --> 00:20:35.699
so to speak.

583
00:20:35.699 --> 00:20:36.936
The thing is,

584
00:20:36.936 --> 00:20:40.072
we're living in a society that's largely sleeping.

585
00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:42.387
The media makes fun of it.

586
00:20:42.387 --> 00:20:45.224
Now the media is just starting to treat us

587
00:20:45.224 --> 00:20:46.945
a little more legitimate.

588
00:20:46.945 --> 00:20:48.822
I notice that they're bringing us

589
00:20:48.822 --> 00:20:50.293
into some of the major networks

590
00:20:50.293 --> 00:20:51.318
and everything.

591
00:20:51.318 --> 00:20:54.162
They treat us with a little more respect.

592
00:20:56.372 --> 00:20:57.667
The other ones are still going to come out

593
00:20:57.667 --> 00:20:58.712
and make fun.

594
00:20:58.712 --> 00:21:02.125
The tin hats and the alien key chains. (laughs)

595
00:21:02.125 --> 00:21:04.941
<v Regina>Yeah. There's plenty of that paraphernalia here.</v>

596
00:21:04.941 --> 00:21:07.426
<v ->There's a lot of that. The carnival aspect.</v>

597
00:21:07.426 --> 00:21:08.279
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

598
00:21:08.279 --> 00:21:12.002
<v ->Now there's a large part</v>

599
00:21:12.002 --> 00:21:13.975
that is taking it very, very seriously.

600
00:21:13.975 --> 00:21:17.548
People are coming through with some startling information

601
00:21:17.548 --> 00:21:20.567
about the cosmological balance and change

602
00:21:20.567 --> 00:21:21.793
that is happening to us.

603
00:21:21.793 --> 00:21:23.329
That we're all being caught up in.

604
00:21:24.609 --> 00:21:25.197
I believe,

605
00:21:25.197 --> 00:21:27.309
first of all before anything else,

606
00:21:27.309 --> 00:21:30.445
you will see extraterrestrials well in your lifetime.

607
00:21:30.445 --> 00:21:32.610
<v Regina>Every person here</v>

608
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.765
has said they feel absolutely confident

609
00:21:34.765 --> 00:21:38.572
that this contact is going to take place relatively soon.

610
00:21:38.572 --> 00:21:40.386
That can be anything from a month from now

611
00:21:40.386 --> 00:21:42.433
to ten years or 20 years from now.

612
00:21:42.433 --> 00:21:45.260
That seems to be a widely held belief.

613
00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.371
<v ->A lot of people want to believe that,</v>

614
00:21:47.371 --> 00:21:51.926
in the winter solstice of 2012 is where it happens.

615
00:21:51.926 --> 00:21:53.323
I think that's a brave point,

616
00:21:53.323 --> 00:21:54.784
in the Myan Calendar,

617
00:21:54.784 --> 00:21:56.459
that could very well ...

618
00:21:56.459 --> 00:21:58.432
I don't think that there's going to be a,

619
00:21:58.432 --> 00:21:59.957
necessarily right away,

620
00:21:59.957 --> 00:22:02.443
an overwhelming definitive change.

621
00:22:02.443 --> 00:22:03.349
In the sense that,

622
00:22:03.349 --> 00:22:04.768
I don't believe in the mass landing theory.

623
00:22:04.768 --> 00:22:06.784
I don't think that aliens will land,

624
00:22:06.784 --> 00:22:09.889
necessarily, on any governmental lawn.

625
00:22:09.889 --> 00:22:10.816
<v Regina>Right.</v>

626
00:22:10.816 --> 00:22:13.558
<v ->In North America, Canada, the UK.</v>

627
00:22:13.558 --> 00:22:17.387
I do belive that it's a slow integration process

628
00:22:17.387 --> 00:22:21.525
that seems to be unfolding on a conscious level.

629
00:22:21.525 --> 00:22:24.448
Also in nature level,

630
00:22:24.448 --> 00:22:27.722
which the crop circles are showing us on many levels.

631
00:22:27.722 --> 00:22:30.997
It's a blend where some people ...

632
00:22:30.997 --> 00:22:34.036
it's almost as though the two worlds have suddenly,

633
00:22:34.036 --> 00:22:35.988
somewhat, merged.

634
00:22:37.648 --> 00:22:40.237
Some will get it and pick up the information

635
00:22:40.237 --> 00:22:42.605
and be moved forward.

636
00:22:42.605 --> 00:22:45.346
Others won't have a clue.

637
00:22:45.346 --> 00:22:47.223
They'll deny anything that is happening

638
00:22:47.223 --> 00:22:49.154
and it'll be a very funny time to live in.

639
00:22:49.154 --> 00:22:50.711
Because what I think is happening is

640
00:22:50.711 --> 00:22:52.641
some of us are getting the information

641
00:22:52.641 --> 00:22:55.884
and learning to grow into it slowly,

642
00:22:55.884 --> 00:22:57.068
like nature.

643
00:22:57.068 --> 00:22:58.764
Flowers don't grow overnight.

644
00:22:58.764 --> 00:22:59.713
Plants don't grow overnight.

645
00:22:59.713 --> 00:23:02.593
They grow naturally with the expodential energies

646
00:23:02.593 --> 00:23:03.755
that are brought in

647
00:23:03.755 --> 00:23:06.475
and it finds it's own natural path.

648
00:23:06.475 --> 00:23:07.798
Same with our bodies,

649
00:23:07.798 --> 00:23:09.120
cellular structure, DNA,

650
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.539
and conscious awareness level

651
00:23:10.539 --> 00:23:12.971
to merge with it a little bit.

652
00:23:12.971 --> 00:23:15.883
I think it'll be a very interesting time

653
00:23:15.883 --> 00:23:16.853
to see the next,

654
00:23:16.853 --> 00:23:19.055
certainly the next three years.

655
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.384
<v Regina>Any final comments about</v>

656
00:23:20.384 --> 00:23:21.824
what you feel is most hopeful

657
00:23:21.824 --> 00:23:23.338
from what you've observed here,

658
00:23:23.338 --> 00:23:24.911
this go around?

659
00:23:25.269 --> 00:23:26.773
<v ->I'm an optimist.</v>

660
00:23:26.773 --> 00:23:28.917
Regina, I'm eternally an optimist.

661
00:23:31.057 --> 00:23:32.195
My comments would be

662
00:23:32.195 --> 00:23:36.914
to embrace this experience fully.

663
00:23:40.077 --> 00:23:43.938
Embrace your relationship mastery with your relationships.

664
00:23:43.938 --> 00:23:46.167
Embrace your emotional mastery.

665
00:23:46.167 --> 00:23:50.668
Embrace your purpose life.

666
00:23:50.668 --> 00:23:51.809
Become to point.

667
00:23:51.809 --> 00:23:53.548
Come to a point within

668
00:23:53.548 --> 00:23:57.217
where you realize you're really,

669
00:23:57.217 --> 00:23:59.638
somewhat of a servant on the planet,

670
00:23:59.638 --> 00:24:02.070
but you're here to embrace your leadership.

671
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:06.070
To live life passionately to it's fullest.

672
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:07.648
Absolutely.

673
00:24:07.648 --> 00:24:09.963
There's a lot of people sleeping.

674
00:24:09.963 --> 00:24:11.638
For those that listen to people,

675
00:24:11.638 --> 00:24:12.896
like Conscious Media Network,

676
00:24:12.896 --> 00:24:14.005
which I'm a big fan of,

677
00:24:14.005 --> 00:24:14.912
of course.

678
00:24:14.912 --> 00:24:19.072
I would say afford yourself the opportunity

679
00:24:19.072 --> 00:24:22.688
to be part of the way showers,

680
00:24:22.688 --> 00:24:24.149
the transition team.

681
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:26.197
The ones that make the difference.

682
00:24:26.197 --> 00:24:28.842
That is what love is based in.

683
00:24:28.842 --> 00:24:29.866
That, I feel,

684
00:24:29.866 --> 00:24:33.460
is a large ingredient of what love makes up.

685
00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:36.063
How we can change, transform lives

686
00:24:36.063 --> 00:24:40.169
and cause life and living to flourish in a great way.

687
00:24:40.169 --> 00:24:44.073
Don't get sidetracked by all the other drama.

688
00:24:44.073 --> 00:24:46.302
Your true nature is the one of love.

689
00:24:46.302 --> 00:24:48.275
<v Regina>On that,</v>

690
00:24:48.275 --> 00:24:49.971
thank you very much for your time.

691
00:24:49.971 --> 00:24:52.158
<v ->Thank you, Regina, for having me.</v>

692
00:24:52.158 --> 00:24:54.611
<v ->You can pick up a copy of Robert's books,</v>

693
00:24:54.611 --> 00:24:55.731
"The Divine Blueprint",

694
00:24:55.731 --> 00:24:57.309
or "The Divine Architects",

695
00:24:57.309 --> 00:24:59.677
at Amazon or other major book sellers.

696
00:24:59.677 --> 00:25:01.320
Meanwhile, we have lots more information

697
00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.272
on the growing field of Ufology.

698
00:25:03.272 --> 00:25:05.384
You might want to begin by watching our interviews

699
00:25:05.384 --> 00:25:06.343
with Robert Dean,

700
00:25:06.343 --> 00:25:07.314
Stephen Basset,

701
00:25:07.314 --> 00:25:09.149
Richard Hoagland and Michael Berra.

702
00:25:09.149 --> 00:25:10.034
Until next time,

703
00:25:10.034 --> 00:25:12.556
thanks for watching CMN.

704
00:25:12.956 --> 00:25:17.851
(calm music)
