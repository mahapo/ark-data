00:00:01.286 --> 00:00:03.621
<v ->Get ready to be informed and inspired</v>

2
00:00:03.621 --> 00:00:05.556
without the typical cliches.

3
00:00:05.556 --> 00:00:07.825
There's not a wasted word in this interview

4
00:00:07.825 --> 00:00:11.262
with a man who struck out into the world at age 14

5
00:00:11.262 --> 00:00:12.998
after being told he would never be able to

6
00:00:12.998 --> 00:00:14.699
read or retain knowledge.

7
00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.969
Well, after studying more than 200 different -ologies

8
00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:20.939
and beyond, he put his genius into action.

9
00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.841
Today he spends 300 days a year delighting people

10
00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:27.512
with his wisdom as a lecturer, teacher, and consultant,

11
00:00:27.512 --> 00:00:29.514
and applying universal principles to building

12
00:00:29.514 --> 00:00:33.504
sustainable lives in relationship, finance, and more.

13
00:00:33.504 --> 00:00:38.504 line:15% 
(upbeat music)

14
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.026 line:15% 
A big issue in, certainly in the progressive,

15
00:00:42.026 --> 00:00:44.764
I guess you could say, spiritual community,

16
00:00:44.764 --> 00:00:46.298
has to do with money.

17
00:00:46.298 --> 00:00:48.476
People have oftentimes made their money

18
00:00:48.476 --> 00:00:49.834
then they decide they want to take

19
00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:52.504
another heart-inspired direction in life,

20
00:00:52.504 --> 00:00:55.072
and suddenly don't know how to make that happen anymore,

21
00:00:55.072 --> 00:00:56.774
or think that there's something incongruous

22
00:00:56.774 --> 00:00:59.277
about feeling fulfilled and making money.

23
00:00:59.277 --> 00:01:02.113
You say not, in fact, I love the title of this book,

24
00:01:02.113 --> 00:01:06.084
How to Make One Hell of a Profit and Still Get to Heaven.

25
00:01:06.084 --> 00:01:11.084
So what is it in us that creates that conflict so often?

26
00:01:11.188 --> 00:01:13.188
<v ->Well, that's a great question.</v>

27
00:01:14.059 --> 00:01:16.027
I'm not sure, with absolute certainty

28
00:01:16.027 --> 00:01:18.897
if it's not religious origin,

29
00:01:18.897 --> 00:01:21.633
because there is a belief out there that it's,

30
00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:23.902
you know, more blessed to give than to receive,

31
00:01:23.902 --> 00:01:27.106
and the impoverished is somehow more spiritual

32
00:01:27.106 --> 00:01:30.975
in some aspects of religious writings.

33
00:01:30.975 --> 00:01:33.844
But I always say when you go and visit the Vatican

34
00:01:33.844 --> 00:01:35.713
there's a little bit of wealth there. (chuckles)

35
00:01:35.713 --> 00:01:36.647
<v Blonde woman>More than a little.</v>

36
00:01:36.647 --> 00:01:37.983
<v ->And I always say when if it's more blessed</v>

37
00:01:37.983 --> 00:01:38.850
to give than to receive,

38
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.117
then the people who are receiving,

39
00:01:40.117 --> 00:01:42.888
I don't know if they're cursed, or what the deal is there.

40
00:01:42.888 --> 00:01:46.157
But I really believe that fair exchange,

41
00:01:46.157 --> 00:01:48.060
and I emphasize that in my book,

42
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.561
that fair exchange is the one

43
00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:52.464
that allows us to remain present.

44
00:01:52.464 --> 00:01:55.767
Now see, I was blessed to come across

45
00:01:55.767 --> 00:01:57.401
what I consider one of the greatest writings

46
00:01:57.401 --> 00:02:00.238
ever created on wealth building,

47
00:02:00.238 --> 00:02:02.106
and it was called the Book of Wealth.

48
00:02:02.106 --> 00:02:03.307
<v Blonde woman>Who wrote that?</v>

49
00:02:03.307 --> 00:02:06.811
<v ->Hubert Howe Bancroft, in about 1896.</v>

50
00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:10.348
It's a 10-volume set, and it's an extraordinary set,

51
00:02:10.348 --> 00:02:11.883
and I have one in my possession now,

52
00:02:11.883 --> 00:02:13.918
and it's a great masterpiece,

53
00:02:13.918 --> 00:02:16.689
and what they did is they explored the history

54
00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:18.989
of the greatest, most empowering,

55
00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.493
inspirational temples, religious organizations,

56
00:02:22.493 --> 00:02:24.762
institutions, and individuals,

57
00:02:24.762 --> 00:02:26.998
all the way back to Sumeria, Chaldea,

58
00:02:26.998 --> 00:02:29.167
Egypt, all the way 'til today.

59
00:02:29.167 --> 00:02:30.468
So they've gone through and looked at

60
00:02:30.468 --> 00:02:32.269
what was wealth building, all the way

61
00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.607
for the last 5,000 or plus, 6,000 years, or whatever.

62
00:02:35.607 --> 00:02:37.524
And it showed that really,

63
00:02:38.543 --> 00:02:40.613
in contradiction to the idea that spiritual

64
00:02:40.613 --> 00:02:42.613
and material are somehow separate,

65
00:02:42.613 --> 00:02:44.583
it showed very clearly that the people

66
00:02:44.583 --> 00:02:47.251
who actually gave the most contribution to society

67
00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:48.687
and helped build culture

68
00:02:48.687 --> 00:02:51.323
had integrated those and brought those together.

69
00:02:51.323 --> 00:02:54.359
So our spiritual, it's kind of like a statement

70
00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.694
that comes from those ancient times,

71
00:02:56.694 --> 00:02:59.730
that spirit without matter is expressionless,

72
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.600
and matter without spirit is motionless,

73
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.235
and they're inseparable.

74
00:03:04.235 --> 00:03:07.906
Albert Einstein kind of reframed spirituality as energy

75
00:03:07.906 --> 00:03:11.075
and he wrote in his Principles of Equivalency

76
00:03:11.075 --> 00:03:13.812
that energy and matter are interconvertable

77
00:03:13.812 --> 00:03:16.782
and so really to be able to manifest

78
00:03:16.782 --> 00:03:20.784
and create great wealth does take spiritual focus

79
00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:22.521
and the laws of spirituality.

80
00:03:22.521 --> 00:03:25.824
In fact, the very word in theology on the word service

81
00:03:25.824 --> 00:03:27.959
comes in economy, economics,

82
00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.861
and in theology are all the same root.

83
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:32.196
So to be able to serve another individual

84
00:03:32.196 --> 00:03:34.033
and be able to provide a value

85
00:03:34.033 --> 00:03:35.799
and then reap the rewards of that

86
00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.585
is really of theological origin.

87
00:03:38.604 --> 00:03:39.904
<v Blonde woman>You've done a lot of work</v>

88
00:03:39.904 --> 00:03:43.708
along this theme, with visioning for example.

89
00:03:43.708 --> 00:03:47.261
But from what I'm seeing there is,

90
00:03:48.646 --> 00:03:53.368
there's a disparity between visioning and creating.

91
00:03:54.852 --> 00:03:56.153
And a lot of people think, okay,

92
00:03:56.153 --> 00:03:58.390
I'll just, let's see.

93
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.558
Okay, I can see myself in my mansion,

94
00:04:00.558 --> 00:04:03.394
and on a really nice vacation, and call it quits,

95
00:04:03.394 --> 00:04:05.663
and that's the way to create wealth.

96
00:04:05.663 --> 00:04:06.831
But that's not the way.

97
00:04:06.831 --> 00:04:08.300
What is the problem here?

98
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.501
<v ->Well, that's part of the way. (chuckles)</v>

99
00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:13.470
There's no doubt that having a creative idea

100
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.074
and an envisionment of what you would love

101
00:04:16.074 --> 00:04:18.110
is one of the first steps in creating things,

102
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.278
but also there's action steps.

103
00:04:21.278 --> 00:04:23.849
And, you know, out of all the things that I've found

104
00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:27.083
that tend to hinder the building of wealth

105
00:04:27.083 --> 00:04:30.355
it all boils down to their hierarchy of values.

106
00:04:30.355 --> 00:04:31.855
That's my observation, anyway.

107
00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:35.225
In other words, imagine that there's a series of values,

108
00:04:35.225 --> 00:04:37.896
a priority of values that each person has in their life,

109
00:04:37.896 --> 00:04:40.531
and whatever's absolutely on the top

110
00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:42.301
is where they have discipline and order,

111
00:04:42.301 --> 00:04:44.002
and whatever's lower on their value list

112
00:04:44.002 --> 00:04:46.437
is where there's chaos, and disorder,

113
00:04:46.437 --> 00:04:48.574
and procrastination, hesitation.

114
00:04:48.574 --> 00:04:51.508
And whereas we always have the time and energy

115
00:04:51.508 --> 00:04:52.945
for things that are really important to us,

116
00:04:52.945 --> 00:04:55.381
but the things that aren't we tend to procrastinate on.

117
00:04:55.381 --> 00:04:58.016
Well, if we do not have a value on,

118
00:04:58.016 --> 00:05:00.517
and appreciation for building wealth

119
00:05:00.517 --> 00:05:02.621
and saving money, then the likelihood

120
00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:05.356
of that ever staying with us is very, very slim.

121
00:05:05.356 --> 00:05:07.358
In fact, what's interesting,

122
00:05:07.358 --> 00:05:09.693
if you imagine all of a sudden having,

123
00:05:09.693 --> 00:05:12.429
say, $1,000, or $10,000, or something

124
00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:14.432
come to you on a monthly basis,

125
00:05:14.432 --> 00:05:18.670
and it was to actually be brought into your presence

126
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.204
your hierarchy of values would determine

127
00:05:20.204 --> 00:05:21.972
exactly what you'd do with it.

128
00:05:21.972 --> 00:05:23.142
So in other words, if your highest value

129
00:05:23.142 --> 00:05:25.243
was children's education, children's health,

130
00:05:25.243 --> 00:05:27.478
children's home, vacation,

131
00:05:27.478 --> 00:05:29.147
nice furniture, and things of this nature,

132
00:05:29.147 --> 00:05:31.749
and number 20 was saving money and building wealth

133
00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:33.551
then as the money comes in it will immediately

134
00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:36.287
be dispersed according to what your values are.

135
00:05:36.287 --> 00:05:38.624
And so if saving money is so low on the values

136
00:05:38.624 --> 00:05:40.878
you will always have more month at the end of the money

137
00:05:40.878 --> 00:05:42.860
than more money at the end of the month.

138
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.861
So what'll happen is just,

139
00:05:43.861 --> 00:05:45.631
it's not really how much you make,

140
00:05:45.631 --> 00:05:47.098
it's how you manage what you make,

141
00:05:47.098 --> 00:05:48.266
and the hierarchy of your values

142
00:05:48.266 --> 00:05:50.068
determine how you manage it.

143
00:05:50.068 --> 00:05:51.870
So I know people that've literally,

144
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.205
in fact, I worked with a doctor

145
00:05:53.205 --> 00:05:56.074
who made $6 million in one year.

146
00:05:56.074 --> 00:05:57.509
That's a lot of money,

147
00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:59.277
and at the end of the year he had to borrow

148
00:05:59.277 --> 00:06:02.313
$327,000 to pay his taxes.

149
00:06:02.313 --> 00:06:03.481
Now you'd think, well, how can you get

150
00:06:03.481 --> 00:06:04.716
$6 million dollars and have to

151
00:06:04.716 --> 00:06:06.351
borrow money to pay taxes?

152
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:08.453
But what he had is he had a very high taste

153
00:06:08.453 --> 00:06:11.622
on art, and parties, and fancy cars,

154
00:06:11.622 --> 00:06:13.324
and beautiful homes, and what he did

155
00:06:13.324 --> 00:06:14.892
is those were higher in his values

156
00:06:14.892 --> 00:06:17.428
than actually saving money and paying taxes.

157
00:06:17.428 --> 00:06:19.887
So what happened is, after he did all the spending

158
00:06:19.887 --> 00:06:21.699
on all the things that he wanted,

159
00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:23.901
he still forgot to pay his taxes and save his money

160
00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:25.337
so he was in debt.

161
00:06:25.337 --> 00:06:27.538
So it really doesn't matter how much you make.

162
00:06:27.538 --> 00:06:30.107
In fact, what's interesting is that very same gentleman

163
00:06:30.107 --> 00:06:31.844
had an assistant working for him

164
00:06:31.844 --> 00:06:34.045
that was making $2,000 a month,

165
00:06:34.045 --> 00:06:36.246
but she had a different set of values

166
00:06:36.246 --> 00:06:39.449
and she was saving $400 of that every month,

167
00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:40.551
and she was actually closer

168
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:42.854
to financial independence than he was.

169
00:06:42.854 --> 00:06:43.988
Not because of the income,

170
00:06:43.988 --> 00:06:46.057
but because of the values they were holding.

171
00:06:46.057 --> 00:06:47.725
So out of all the things that I've observed

172
00:06:47.725 --> 00:06:48.993
the hierarchy of one's values

173
00:06:48.993 --> 00:06:50.862
dictates their financial destiny,

174
00:06:50.862 --> 00:06:53.932
and can determine, regardless of how much income they have,

175
00:06:53.932 --> 00:06:56.133
whether they'll ever have financial independence.

176
00:06:56.133 --> 00:06:58.369
And you know what's interesting too,

177
00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:02.807
in America people save a very small percentage.

178
00:07:02.807 --> 00:07:05.108
I mean, it's maybe one, two, or three percent,

179
00:07:05.108 --> 00:07:06.711
and what's quite amazing is

180
00:07:06.711 --> 00:07:08.912
the only way they save in their life

181
00:07:08.912 --> 00:07:11.048
is their mortgage and their pension,

182
00:07:11.048 --> 00:07:12.583
and it wasn't because of them,

183
00:07:12.583 --> 00:07:14.218
it was because the mortgage company forced them

184
00:07:14.218 --> 00:07:16.086
to save and build equity in their home,

185
00:07:16.086 --> 00:07:18.689
and because the pension was done automatically.

186
00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:20.391
In other words, if it was up to them

187
00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:22.861
it would actually be below, it would be in debt,

188
00:07:22.861 --> 00:07:24.293
and the average person would be in debt.

189
00:07:24.293 --> 00:07:27.865
So if it wasn't for forced savings by those two mechanisms,

190
00:07:27.865 --> 00:07:29.234
the majority of people in America

191
00:07:29.234 --> 00:07:32.737
would actually be in financial destitution.

192
00:07:32.737 --> 00:07:34.538
So that's important to have sort of a value on it,

193
00:07:34.538 --> 00:07:35.506
and force system on it.

194
00:07:35.506 --> 00:07:37.007
<v Blonde woman>That's very important.</v>

195
00:07:37.007 --> 00:07:38.944
I have a lot of artist friends,

196
00:07:38.944 --> 00:07:40.544
and a lot of them will say,

197
00:07:40.544 --> 00:07:43.063
"Oh, spirit will take care of me."

198
00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:47.719
Well, and you do deal a lot with your inner voice,

199
00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:49.120
with going to the inner voice,

200
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.988
with allowing it to be your guidance.

201
00:07:50.988 --> 00:07:54.158
But from a really practical viewpoint,

202
00:07:54.158 --> 00:07:56.927
how do you marry these two elements

203
00:07:56.927 --> 00:07:59.564
of spirit and practicality?

204
00:07:59.564 --> 00:08:02.633
<v ->Well, I like to think the spirit is the inner voice</v>

205
00:08:02.633 --> 00:08:05.569
and inner vision, or the calling if you will,

206
00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:10.107
that calls you to a cause, a service to bring to this world.

207
00:08:10.107 --> 00:08:12.576
I would say everybody who has a mission has a message,

208
00:08:12.576 --> 00:08:15.380
and everyone who has a mission and a message has a service.

209
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.848
So that's our spiritual quest,

210
00:08:16.848 --> 00:08:18.616
to call us to do something to this world

211
00:08:18.616 --> 00:08:20.384
and contribute to the world.

212
00:08:20.384 --> 00:08:22.852
And then the other side is the willingness to receive.

213
00:08:22.852 --> 00:08:24.321
So we have the ability to give,

214
00:08:24.321 --> 00:08:26.155
but we also have the ability to receive,

215
00:08:26.155 --> 00:08:28.160
and we need that side too, to be able to manifest,

216
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.927
because if we are not willing to receive,

217
00:08:29.927 --> 00:08:32.229
we stop our willingness to give.

218
00:08:32.229 --> 00:08:33.765
And I know, I've seen the same thing.

219
00:08:33.765 --> 00:08:35.366
I've seen people who, you know,

220
00:08:35.366 --> 00:08:37.595
are kind of chanting, and sitting there

221
00:08:37.595 --> 00:08:39.570
with their white, or purple or something,

222
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:41.171
which is great, i love the colors.

223
00:08:41.171 --> 00:08:43.941
Then they'll say, well somehow it'll always provide,

224
00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:45.877
but I find the people that do that,

225
00:08:45.877 --> 00:08:47.845
in some cases they have that result,

226
00:08:47.845 --> 00:08:49.446
but it's usually because they're associated with somebody

227
00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:51.882
that's got the cash flow. (laughing)

228
00:08:51.882 --> 00:08:55.053
But what my experience is, if they don't value it for them

229
00:08:55.053 --> 00:08:56.921
it passes right through their hands.

230
00:08:56.921 --> 00:08:59.523
Money automatically passes through people

231
00:08:59.523 --> 00:09:02.860
who devalue it to the hands of people who value it.

232
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.328
It's kind of like a relationship.

233
00:09:04.328 --> 00:09:05.896
If you don't appreciate your relationship

234
00:09:05.896 --> 00:09:08.499
it goes somewhere else, to somewhere who does.

235
00:09:08.499 --> 00:09:09.968
If you don't appreciate your clients,

236
00:09:09.968 --> 00:09:11.669
it goes to somebody who does.

237
00:09:11.669 --> 00:09:14.206
And if you don't appreciate the purpose of economics

238
00:09:14.206 --> 00:09:17.074
and wealth, it goes right to the people who do.

239
00:09:17.074 --> 00:09:19.042
So having a spiritual mission,

240
00:09:19.042 --> 00:09:21.779
and having something that's inspiring is essential,

241
00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:23.914
and what's even more interesting and inspiring,

242
00:09:23.914 --> 00:09:27.218
if you have zero dollars and you add a dollar,

243
00:09:27.218 --> 00:09:28.385
you make your first dollar,

244
00:09:28.385 --> 00:09:30.622
the value of that dollar is 100%.

245
00:09:30.622 --> 00:09:33.024
If you have $100 and you add a dollar

246
00:09:33.024 --> 00:09:34.625
the value is 1%.

247
00:09:34.625 --> 00:09:37.462
If you have, you know, $1,000, it's .1%,

248
00:09:37.462 --> 00:09:39.129
and $10,000, .01.

249
00:09:39.129 --> 00:09:41.432
And as you accumulate more money

250
00:09:41.432 --> 00:09:43.801
the value of the additional dollar goes down,

251
00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:46.838
so there's a depreciation of that dollar.

252
00:09:46.838 --> 00:09:48.240
In other words, if you have zero money

253
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.307
you wouldn't even consider, you know,

254
00:09:50.307 --> 00:09:51.442
blowing your nose with a dollar,

255
00:09:51.442 --> 00:09:52.409
but if you have a million dollars,

256
00:09:52.409 --> 00:09:53.577
you're gonna blow your nose with it.

257
00:09:53.577 --> 00:09:55.398
You know, you wouldn't think about it 'cause it's devalued.

258
00:09:55.398 --> 00:09:58.382
Now, if we want to grow our wealth,

259
00:09:58.382 --> 00:10:00.217
if we don't have a spiritual calling,

260
00:10:00.217 --> 00:10:01.553
or some spiritual cause,

261
00:10:01.553 --> 00:10:03.621
or something we can dedicate our lives to

262
00:10:03.621 --> 00:10:06.556
that requires money to grow

263
00:10:06.556 --> 00:10:09.327
inversely to the devaluation of the dollar,

264
00:10:09.327 --> 00:10:11.328
then what happens, we plateau our wealth.

265
00:10:11.328 --> 00:10:12.763
So we have a responsibility,

266
00:10:12.763 --> 00:10:14.166
which is a spiritual component,

267
00:10:14.166 --> 00:10:16.668
to continually be humbled, to go inside,

268
00:10:16.668 --> 00:10:19.203
to ask what is our mission, and our calling,

269
00:10:19.203 --> 00:10:21.938
and consistently grow that cause

270
00:10:21.938 --> 00:10:24.074
to draw into us more income,

271
00:10:24.074 --> 00:10:26.178
or otherwise we'll plateau and stagnate.

272
00:10:26.178 --> 00:10:28.313
So the spirit and matter are together,

273
00:10:28.313 --> 00:10:30.447
inseparable again, and this is why

274
00:10:30.447 --> 00:10:32.215
I think that the separation that,

275
00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:33.284
and the reason I wrote the book,

276
00:10:33.284 --> 00:10:34.918
is to try to reintegrate that,

277
00:10:34.918 --> 00:10:36.488
because people who have spiritual callings

278
00:10:36.488 --> 00:10:38.555
are the people that actually require the wealth

279
00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:40.207
in order to fulfill those great callings.

280
00:10:41.759 --> 00:10:43.127
<v Blonde woman>And doing what you love</v>

281
00:10:43.127 --> 00:10:45.062
is a point that you really hit heavily on

282
00:10:45.062 --> 00:10:46.513
when you're working with people.

283
00:10:48.266 --> 00:10:51.234
So doing what you love is the first half of it,

284
00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:53.938
but often, again, these are the same people

285
00:10:53.938 --> 00:10:56.742
that're often lost in doing what they love,

286
00:10:56.742 --> 00:10:59.744
and, oh, I forgot to make money last year.

287
00:10:59.744 --> 00:11:00.879
<v ->Well, they have the heaven force,</v>

288
00:11:00.879 --> 00:11:02.011
but the don't have the earth force.

289
00:11:02.011 --> 00:11:03.013
They've gotta ground themselves

290
00:11:03.013 --> 00:11:05.750
and make sure that they invest in themselves.

291
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.286
When I first started speaking, it was quite funny,

292
00:11:08.286 --> 00:11:10.654
I did it in my apartment and I put a little bowl out,

293
00:11:10.654 --> 00:11:13.291
little love donation, kind of like a church,

294
00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:14.992
and I had about 15, 20 people there

295
00:11:14.992 --> 00:11:17.561
and at the end of it, five dollars was in there,

296
00:11:17.561 --> 00:11:19.928
and I guess nobody loved me. (both chuckle)

297
00:11:19.928 --> 00:11:21.298
So it was interesting.

298
00:11:21.298 --> 00:11:23.000
The next week i said that's not working,

299
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.001
so I put in there a little sign,

300
00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:26.803
"Minimum love donation, five dollars."

301
00:11:26.803 --> 00:11:28.672
And I got, I think, three five dollar bills

302
00:11:28.672 --> 00:11:29.573
at the end of that, and I thought,

303
00:11:29.573 --> 00:11:30.741
well that's a little better.

304
00:11:30.741 --> 00:11:32.010
And I was trying to pay my rent,

305
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.277
I was going, this isn't working.

306
00:11:33.277 --> 00:11:35.380
So I said minimum love donation $10,

307
00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.215
and that still brought maybe $20 to $30,

308
00:11:37.215 --> 00:11:39.316
and I said minimum donation $20,

309
00:11:39.316 --> 00:11:41.686
and what's interesting is when I got to $20

310
00:11:41.686 --> 00:11:44.989
I had about $40, and I finally got kind of frustrated

311
00:11:44.989 --> 00:11:48.258
I said no, minimum fee, $20,

312
00:11:48.258 --> 00:11:51.495
and 80% of the people put $20 in there.

313
00:11:51.495 --> 00:11:53.665
And I thought, what is going on here?

314
00:11:53.665 --> 00:11:57.835
And I realized a great law, until you value yourself

315
00:11:57.835 --> 00:11:59.737
don't expect anybody else to.

316
00:11:59.737 --> 00:12:02.674
Until you invest in yourself, don't expect anybody else to.

317
00:12:02.674 --> 00:12:04.575
Until you pay yourself first don't expect

318
00:12:04.575 --> 00:12:07.978
to attract people that will value you to pay you first.

319
00:12:07.978 --> 00:12:09.346
And I realized the law of reflection,

320
00:12:09.346 --> 00:12:11.016
which is a spiritual law.

321
00:12:11.016 --> 00:12:13.283
So the universe is actually doing everything it can

322
00:12:13.283 --> 00:12:15.719
to try to encourage you to be magnificent

323
00:12:15.719 --> 00:12:17.923
and to honor yourself, and value yourself.

324
00:12:17.923 --> 00:12:18.989
And so I think it's important

325
00:12:18.989 --> 00:12:20.975
to be able to do that, to say it.

326
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.127
<v Blonde woman>So, going back just a little bit</v>

327
00:12:24.127 --> 00:12:27.799
from there to our hierarchy of values.

328
00:12:27.799 --> 00:12:29.433
When you start working with a person,

329
00:12:29.433 --> 00:12:31.902
or a group, or a client,

330
00:12:31.902 --> 00:12:33.771
is that the place you begin then

331
00:12:33.771 --> 00:12:37.542
is to first determine what your hierarchy of values is?

332
00:12:37.542 --> 00:12:40.545
I mean, I'm going to get to, kind of like, okay,

333
00:12:40.545 --> 00:12:42.179
I agree with everything you've said,

334
00:12:42.179 --> 00:12:44.681
so one, two, three, now, what do we do?

335
00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:46.016
<v ->Well, when I'm working with somebody,</v>

336
00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:48.620
if they're saying, well, you know, I'd like to have wealth,

337
00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.822
I explain to them that everyone has wealth already

338
00:12:51.822 --> 00:12:53.525
but the wealth is always in the form

339
00:12:53.525 --> 00:12:56.293
of what the top values are in their life.

340
00:12:56.293 --> 00:13:00.232
For instance, if a woman has her children at number one,

341
00:13:00.232 --> 00:13:04.001
top value, then what will happen is that's her wealth.

342
00:13:04.001 --> 00:13:05.902
That's what she considers her most precious things,

343
00:13:05.902 --> 00:13:08.373
and you would have to pay her a huge sum of money

344
00:13:08.373 --> 00:13:11.008
to be able to borrow that commodity.

345
00:13:11.008 --> 00:13:13.877
And what's interesting is, if a person is sports oriented

346
00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:16.247
then that's their wealth, keeping their body fit,

347
00:13:16.247 --> 00:13:17.448
and if somebody's business oriented,

348
00:13:17.448 --> 00:13:18.817
that's their wealth.

349
00:13:18.817 --> 00:13:20.484
The person's wealth is always in the hierarchy

350
00:13:20.484 --> 00:13:23.020
of their values, the top few of their values.

351
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.389
That's why it's not that we're not abundant,

352
00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:27.892
it's just that we've not put it into cash flow,

353
00:13:27.892 --> 00:13:29.660
and I'm not saying you have to rent your kids out

354
00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.462
(both laughing) to get converted back into cash,

355
00:13:31.462 --> 00:13:34.164
but if you don't, if you don't somehow value cash

356
00:13:34.164 --> 00:13:37.334
and value, you know, having actual money saved

357
00:13:37.334 --> 00:13:39.302
then what'll happen then is it'll always be in that form,

358
00:13:39.302 --> 00:13:40.538
which is great.

359
00:13:40.538 --> 00:13:43.040
I know people who are very spiritually awakened,

360
00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.574
and what they do, they have the highest value

361
00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:47.011
on social and spiritual causes.

362
00:13:47.011 --> 00:13:48.779
So what happens is their retirement plan

363
00:13:48.779 --> 00:13:50.648
is not their own cash, their retirement plan

364
00:13:50.648 --> 00:13:52.149
is when they're 60 and 70 years old

365
00:13:52.149 --> 00:13:53.951
the church takes care of them.

366
00:13:53.951 --> 00:13:55.953
So that is what their investment was,

367
00:13:55.953 --> 00:13:57.322
and there's nothing wrong with any form

368
00:13:57.322 --> 00:13:58.522
of wealth that's that way,

369
00:13:58.522 --> 00:14:00.258
'cause wealth means wellbeing.

370
00:14:00.258 --> 00:14:04.162
But the bottom line is, the versatility of cash,

371
00:14:04.162 --> 00:14:06.162
the versatility of having, saving money

372
00:14:06.162 --> 00:14:08.698
allows you exchange, fairly exchange,

373
00:14:08.698 --> 00:14:11.134
with other people from one service to another

374
00:14:11.134 --> 00:14:12.936
with the most variety.

375
00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:14.971
In other words, if I'm bartering with you

376
00:14:14.971 --> 00:14:16.473
then what talent you have is all

377
00:14:16.473 --> 00:14:18.074
I'm able to exchange with,

378
00:14:18.074 --> 00:14:20.777
and if I don't need that talent it's hard to exchange.

379
00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:23.280
But with money the value and the purpose of money

380
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.816
was designed to create a more variety,

381
00:14:25.816 --> 00:14:27.684
and more options of how to exchange

382
00:14:27.684 --> 00:14:29.887
so you could have more fair exchange.

383
00:14:29.887 --> 00:14:33.557
And the original forms of money were cattle, cows.

384
00:14:33.557 --> 00:14:35.660
And imagine if I don't need a cow,

385
00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.527
and I need to do a service, and I need to get paid

386
00:14:37.527 --> 00:14:39.264
and they're gonna give me a cow and I don't need it,

387
00:14:39.264 --> 00:14:40.899
well I gotta have a butcher to break it up

388
00:14:40.899 --> 00:14:43.000
to make eating out of it.

389
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.870
So what happens is it's moved from cows

390
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.473
to coins, to cash, to plastic,

391
00:14:48.473 --> 00:14:50.774
to electronics, to now light.

392
00:14:50.774 --> 00:14:51.718
And that's spiritual.
<v Blonde woman>What do you</v>

393
00:14:51.718 --> 00:14:53.110
mean when you say light?

394
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:54.946
<v ->Well that's the form that now</v>

395
00:14:54.946 --> 00:14:56.547
money is exchanged around the world

396
00:14:56.547 --> 00:14:58.784
at the speed of light, instantaneously.

397
00:14:58.784 --> 00:15:01.718
So it's extremely efficient, and it makes us present.

398
00:15:01.718 --> 00:15:04.955
So in a sense, materiality in the form of money

399
00:15:04.955 --> 00:15:07.058
has become spirituality.

400
00:15:07.058 --> 00:15:09.994
It's instantaneous presence, and fair exchange

401
00:15:09.994 --> 00:15:11.378
from one service to another.

402
00:15:13.263 --> 00:15:14.732
<v Blonde woman>So let's look at it</v>

403
00:15:14.732 --> 00:15:17.013
in reverse for a moment,

404
00:15:17.013 --> 00:15:20.237
and the subject of people who have

405
00:15:20.237 --> 00:15:22.472
vast amounts of money,

406
00:15:22.472 --> 00:15:25.175
and one wise man we interviewed said,

407
00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:27.778
who deals with a lot of this said,

408
00:15:27.778 --> 00:15:29.713
the people that have

409
00:15:29.713 --> 00:15:32.249
far more than their future generations

410
00:15:32.249 --> 00:15:34.518
can even begin to utilize

411
00:15:34.518 --> 00:15:36.987
often have a big hole in the spirit.

412
00:15:36.987 --> 00:15:38.756
So it's not as though they've integrated

413
00:15:38.756 --> 00:15:43.127
the spiritual into their ability to make money,

414
00:15:43.127 --> 00:15:44.695
but rather allowed that to be

415
00:15:44.695 --> 00:15:46.497
their cause in and of itself.

416
00:15:46.497 --> 00:15:48.099
What happens when this occurs?

417
00:15:48.099 --> 00:15:49.266
<v ->Well, you know, it's interesting.</v>

418
00:15:49.266 --> 00:15:50.968
I've been asked that question before,

419
00:15:50.968 --> 00:15:53.370
and I find there are definite people

420
00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.839
who have very little money, if anything,

421
00:15:55.839 --> 00:15:58.342
they're in poverty, and people that have vast fortunes

422
00:15:58.342 --> 00:16:01.211
that do not identify themselves spiritually,

423
00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:03.380
but I also know a multi-billionaire in New York City

424
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.748
who's dedicated his whole life

425
00:16:04.748 --> 00:16:07.284
to the Tibetan Foundation, for instance.

426
00:16:07.284 --> 00:16:08.786
And so I know people with vast fortunes,

427
00:16:08.786 --> 00:16:11.621
their whole life is about metaphysics and spirituality,

428
00:16:11.621 --> 00:16:13.023
so I've seen both sides of that.

429
00:16:13.023 --> 00:16:14.991
So I don't know if it's because of the money

430
00:16:14.991 --> 00:16:16.927
or it's just their selection of values in their life.

431
00:16:16.927 --> 00:16:18.795
I wouldn't say that money makes that happen,

432
00:16:18.795 --> 00:16:20.864
that people have that as a value.

433
00:16:20.864 --> 00:16:22.099
Now it's been my experience this,

434
00:16:22.099 --> 00:16:25.803
and this is probably gonna be a little challenging here,

435
00:16:25.803 --> 00:16:28.639
but I always say where is spirit not?

436
00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:30.941
And I'm gonna use the word God here for a moment

437
00:16:30.941 --> 00:16:34.745
because God to me is like the grand organized designer,

438
00:16:34.745 --> 00:16:36.580
G-O-D, or the grand organized design

439
00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.716
if you don't want to personify it,

440
00:16:38.716 --> 00:16:40.819
and I like to think of it as where is it not.

441
00:16:40.819 --> 00:16:43.486
Where is God not, or where is love not?

442
00:16:43.486 --> 00:16:44.655
We tend to want to think that, well,

443
00:16:44.655 --> 00:16:47.257
spirituality is this meditation,

444
00:16:47.257 --> 00:16:49.292
or spirituality is this prayer,

445
00:16:49.292 --> 00:16:51.361
or spirituality is this temple.

446
00:16:51.361 --> 00:16:53.396
But to the mother who's raising a child

447
00:16:53.396 --> 00:16:56.600
their spirituality is that daily dedication to the child,

448
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.236
and hugging that child with their heart open.

449
00:16:59.236 --> 00:17:00.971
A person who's dedicated to sports,

450
00:17:00.971 --> 00:17:03.006
their spirituality is the prayer that they say

451
00:17:03.006 --> 00:17:05.109
when they're about to go on that field

452
00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:08.178
and do that performance that's absolutely mind boggling.

453
00:17:08.178 --> 00:17:11.082
Or the person who's maybe building an architectural design,

454
00:17:11.082 --> 00:17:13.918
their heart and their dream is putting it into

455
00:17:13.918 --> 00:17:17.054
a piece of art that shows for maybe the next century.

456
00:17:17.054 --> 00:17:20.792
So spirituality is not necessarily limited to a box,

457
00:17:20.792 --> 00:17:23.093
it's everything, and I always like to think

458
00:17:23.093 --> 00:17:25.863
that's it's omnipresent, and to box it in

459
00:17:25.863 --> 00:17:27.263
and say that person's spiritual

460
00:17:27.263 --> 00:17:30.366
and this person isn't, I think, is a misnomer.

461
00:17:30.366 --> 00:17:32.436
Because what happens is we project our values

462
00:17:32.436 --> 00:17:34.338
onto people, and if it doesn't match our version

463
00:17:34.338 --> 00:17:36.906
of spirituality we think they're not spiritual,

464
00:17:36.906 --> 00:17:38.275
and if it doesn't support our values

465
00:17:38.275 --> 00:17:40.109
we think they have a hole in their heart.

466
00:17:40.109 --> 00:17:41.945
But actually, if you get to meet those individuals

467
00:17:41.945 --> 00:17:43.915
and get to know them as who they are

468
00:17:43.915 --> 00:17:45.648
they have something that inspires them

469
00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:47.317
that they dedicate their lives to.

470
00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:49.819
Whatever it may be is their spiritual path.

471
00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:50.822
So I like to think of it--

472
00:17:50.822 --> 00:17:52.023
<v Blonde woman>What if it's fear?</v>

473
00:17:52.023 --> 00:17:53.523
<v ->Well, if there's fear running their life</v>

474
00:17:53.523 --> 00:17:55.526
their heart is closed, but obviously,

475
00:17:55.526 --> 00:17:56.893
they don't live day in and day out,

476
00:17:56.893 --> 00:17:59.252
every day, all day, in their fear.

477
00:17:59.252 --> 00:18:01.099
I mean, when I get to know people,

478
00:18:01.099 --> 00:18:02.799
when I actually get to meet them,

479
00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:05.035
my first impression sometime is shattered,

480
00:18:05.035 --> 00:18:06.904
and I find out that they're loving individuals

481
00:18:06.904 --> 00:18:09.239
to something, to somebody, somewhere,

482
00:18:09.239 --> 00:18:11.291
and what that is their spiritual, their connection.

483
00:18:12.442 --> 00:18:14.912
<v Blonde woman>So going down that same path</v>

484
00:18:14.912 --> 00:18:19.049
then healing some of the gaps

485
00:18:19.049 --> 00:18:21.853
between cultures and peoples

486
00:18:21.853 --> 00:18:25.039
and individuals,

487
00:18:26.489 --> 00:18:27.992
from what I'm hearing you say

488
00:18:27.992 --> 00:18:30.928
it doesn't matter how high you go in the hierarchy,

489
00:18:30.928 --> 00:18:34.766
socioeconomically, that you generally find

490
00:18:34.766 --> 00:18:37.902
that the love is there, at some level.

491
00:18:37.902 --> 00:18:42.073
How do we crack that open

492
00:18:42.073 --> 00:18:44.741
so that resources, for example,

493
00:18:44.741 --> 00:18:48.346
flow more easily between all of the people?

494
00:18:48.346 --> 00:18:51.815
<v ->Well, there's two types of financial people</v>

495
00:18:51.815 --> 00:18:52.950
I like to think of.

496
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.183
You have the financial managers

497
00:18:54.183 --> 00:18:56.454
who're attempting to help people build wealth,

498
00:18:56.454 --> 00:18:59.087
and then you have the economists

499
00:18:59.087 --> 00:19:01.591
helping people redistribute wealth.

500
00:19:01.591 --> 00:19:02.993
So what happens is, that the people who're

501
00:19:02.993 --> 00:19:04.761
trying to build the wealth are trying to create

502
00:19:04.761 --> 00:19:06.597
the have and the have-nots, you might say.

503
00:19:06.597 --> 00:19:08.631
And the people that value it end up the haves

504
00:19:08.631 --> 00:19:11.035
and the people that devalue it end up the have-nots.

505
00:19:11.035 --> 00:19:13.404
But what happens is, if that becomes extreme

506
00:19:13.404 --> 00:19:16.206
the entire economy gets, it creates a revolution

507
00:19:16.206 --> 00:19:18.809
if you will, it creates instability.

508
00:19:18.809 --> 00:19:20.243
So the economists come in there and try

509
00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:22.179
to redistribute the wealth through taxations

510
00:19:22.179 --> 00:19:24.714
or philanthropic aspects, or something,

511
00:19:24.714 --> 00:19:26.883
and it is essential to stabilize a government

512
00:19:26.883 --> 00:19:29.286
and stabilize a culture to have that redistribution,

513
00:19:29.286 --> 00:19:30.520
the Robin Hood effect.

514
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.789
It's absolutely essential,

515
00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:34.958
and usually when people continue to gain great wealth

516
00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:37.127
sooner or later nature gives them challenges,

517
00:19:37.127 --> 00:19:39.162
or tragedies, or humbling circumstances.

518
00:19:39.162 --> 00:19:41.197
There's extractions to force them to be

519
00:19:41.197 --> 00:19:42.965
philanthropic, to redistribute for

520
00:19:42.965 --> 00:19:44.868
the people who may not have.

521
00:19:44.868 --> 00:19:47.337
But in either case, and this is happening in South Africa,

522
00:19:47.337 --> 00:19:49.506
I'm actually involved in it, but what happens is

523
00:19:49.506 --> 00:19:52.376
is as long as the people do not value wealth,

524
00:19:52.376 --> 00:19:55.479
even if you redistribute it, it will be redistributed back,

525
00:19:55.479 --> 00:19:56.946
'cause money always flows to where

526
00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:58.548
it's valued and appreciated, and studied,

527
00:19:58.548 --> 00:20:01.118
and understood, and have certainty the most.

528
00:20:01.118 --> 00:20:03.486
So it's automatically redistributed again

529
00:20:03.486 --> 00:20:05.890
because if the people do not value it

530
00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:06.988
it's gonna go right through their hands

531
00:20:06.988 --> 00:20:08.908
into the people who do, that's how life is.

532
00:20:10.127 --> 00:20:11.929
<v Blonde woman>Well that's very elegantly simple,</v>

533
00:20:11.929 --> 00:20:13.430
and it's the first time I've really heard

534
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.366
anybody put it that way.

535
00:20:15.366 --> 00:20:17.234
<v ->Well I've had some interesting things,</v>

536
00:20:17.234 --> 00:20:19.403
I've watched doctors that I've worked with,

537
00:20:19.403 --> 00:20:20.805
I consult with a lot of doctors,

538
00:20:20.805 --> 00:20:23.573
and I watch the people, their personalities,

539
00:20:23.573 --> 00:20:25.642
and their habits, and I look at their values.

540
00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:27.278
And the doctor will say, well, you know,

541
00:20:27.278 --> 00:20:28.513
why is it that this person's got this

542
00:20:28.513 --> 00:20:30.081
very successful and big practice

543
00:20:30.081 --> 00:20:32.282
and makes lots of money and I don't?

544
00:20:32.282 --> 00:20:34.501
And I'm gonna use one example, a story.

545
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.288
This doctor comes to me and he says,

546
00:20:37.288 --> 00:20:39.423
"I want you to help me become successful."

547
00:20:39.423 --> 00:20:41.092
And I said fantastic.

548
00:20:41.092 --> 00:20:42.826
I said, "So where are you successful?"

549
00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:45.228
And he said, "Well, I'm not successful,

550
00:20:45.228 --> 00:20:47.097
"I want you to help me become successful."

551
00:20:47.097 --> 00:20:48.699
And I said, "So where are you successful?"

552
00:20:48.699 --> 00:20:50.467
He says, "Dr. Demartini, you're not hearing me.

553
00:20:50.467 --> 00:20:52.068
"I'm not, I want to be."

554
00:20:52.068 --> 00:20:53.469
I said, "You're not listening,

555
00:20:53.469 --> 00:20:56.106
"I'm asking, where are you successful?"

556
00:20:56.106 --> 00:20:57.541
He looked at me and he paused for a moment

557
00:20:57.541 --> 00:20:59.476
and he says, "Well, I guess I have a successful

558
00:20:59.476 --> 00:21:01.511
"relationship with my wife.

559
00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:03.183
"We've been together for a decade now,

560
00:21:03.183 --> 00:21:06.115
"we have a great relationship, and it's really rewarding."

561
00:21:06.115 --> 00:21:07.585
And I said, "Fantastic, now where else

562
00:21:07.585 --> 00:21:09.053
"do you have success in your life?"

563
00:21:09.053 --> 00:21:10.587
He says, "Well, I guess I have a great

564
00:21:10.587 --> 00:21:11.755
"relationship with my son.

565
00:21:11.755 --> 00:21:13.825
"He's in baseball and I'm playing the coach this year.

566
00:21:13.825 --> 00:21:15.191
"We may win the Pennant."

567
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:17.060
"And where else are you successful?"

568
00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.797
And he says, "Well, I guess, we're all working in the yard

569
00:21:19.797 --> 00:21:21.064
"and we've planted flowers, and we may get

570
00:21:21.064 --> 00:21:22.466
"yard of the month this month."

571
00:21:22.466 --> 00:21:24.267
I said, "Where else are you successful?"

572
00:21:24.267 --> 00:21:26.269
He says, "Well, my mother-in-law lives with us,

573
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:28.138
"and we really get along, and so many people

574
00:21:28.138 --> 00:21:29.072
"don't get along with their mother-in-law.

575
00:21:29.072 --> 00:21:30.340
"We have this great relationship,

576
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.175
"and that's sort of successful."

577
00:21:32.175 --> 00:21:32.876
I said, "Where else?"

578
00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:35.045
And he says, "Well, on Sundays and on Wednesdays

579
00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:37.747
"I do lay ministry, I'm kind of a lay minister

580
00:21:37.747 --> 00:21:40.050
"and I get to teach at my church,

581
00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.551
"and that was one of my goals in life."

582
00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:43.353
I said, "Can you see that you have successes?"

583
00:21:43.353 --> 00:21:45.757
And he goes, "Well now that you ask that, yes,

584
00:21:45.757 --> 00:21:46.957
"But I don't have that big house,

585
00:21:46.957 --> 00:21:47.992
"I don't have that big money,

586
00:21:47.992 --> 00:21:49.794
"and I don't have the fancy cars."

587
00:21:49.794 --> 00:21:51.961
And I said, "I have a question.

588
00:21:51.961 --> 00:21:54.597
"That gentlemen, you must be comparing it to somebody.

589
00:21:54.597 --> 00:21:56.300
"Who're you comparing yourself to?"

590
00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.069
"Well, that Dr. up on the hill who's got all that money."

591
00:21:59.069 --> 00:22:01.321
I said, "How is his relationship with his wife?"

592
00:22:02.339 --> 00:22:04.275
"Well, yeah, they're having some challenges."

593
00:22:04.275 --> 00:22:05.876
"And what about his son?"

594
00:22:05.876 --> 00:22:07.644
"Uh, yeah, he's on drugs."

595
00:22:07.644 --> 00:22:09.312
"And what about the yard?

596
00:22:09.312 --> 00:22:10.380
"Are they into the yard?"

597
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.283
He says, "No, I think they have keepers of the yard,

598
00:22:12.283 --> 00:22:13.684
"I don't think they even notice it."

599
00:22:13.684 --> 00:22:14.619
"And what about their mother in law?"

600
00:22:14.619 --> 00:22:17.288
"Oh yeah, they moved out of the state to get away from her."

601
00:22:17.288 --> 00:22:20.112
"And what about their church interaction?"

602
00:22:20.112 --> 00:22:21.458
"I don't think they go to church"

603
00:22:21.458 --> 00:22:25.495
I said, "Would you trade what he has

604
00:22:25.495 --> 00:22:27.833
"for everything he has in order to have that?"

605
00:22:27.833 --> 00:22:28.766
He says, "Absolutely not."

606
00:22:28.766 --> 00:22:31.000
I said, "Well, can you see that your hierarchy of values

607
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.204
"have led you to your form of success,

608
00:22:33.204 --> 00:22:35.505
"and his hierarchy of values have led up to his.

609
00:22:35.505 --> 00:22:36.840
"You don't have any less success,

610
00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.641
"you just have a different form.

611
00:22:38.641 --> 00:22:40.977
And one of the messages that I want people to know

612
00:22:40.977 --> 00:22:43.847
is that everybody has success according to their values,

613
00:22:43.847 --> 00:22:45.983
but they may be comparing themselves to other people

614
00:22:45.983 --> 00:22:48.484
and not honoring their magnificence.

615
00:22:48.484 --> 00:22:51.560
And when they understand their magnificence

616
00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.224
they know that if they would like to turn it into cash

617
00:22:54.224 --> 00:22:56.326
that will require a change in values,

618
00:22:56.326 --> 00:22:57.727
but there'll be a price.

619
00:22:57.727 --> 00:23:00.264
So having that change of values and appreciating money

620
00:23:00.264 --> 00:23:02.432
will have a new set of pains and pleasures in their life.

621
00:23:02.432 --> 00:23:04.802
It's not going to be necessarily better or worse,

622
00:23:04.802 --> 00:23:06.203
but it'll be a different set,

623
00:23:06.203 --> 00:23:08.004
and your success will change form.

624
00:23:08.004 --> 00:23:09.372
But the value that money has is

625
00:23:09.372 --> 00:23:11.074
it allows more options in life,

626
00:23:11.074 --> 00:23:13.176
and allows you to, if you are sad,

627
00:23:13.176 --> 00:23:15.378
at least you'll be dressed nicely when you're sad.

628
00:23:15.378 --> 00:23:17.046
<v Blonde woman>(laughing) And you'll be able</v>

629
00:23:17.046 --> 00:23:18.348
to go to a nice restaurant.

630
00:23:18.348 --> 00:23:20.350
<v ->A nice restaurant, but you know it is interesting,</v>

631
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:22.953
and this is true, there is a statistic that shows

632
00:23:22.953 --> 00:23:25.522
that people that do learn how to save their money

633
00:23:25.522 --> 00:23:28.291
they do end up living longer, overall.

634
00:23:28.291 --> 00:23:29.092
And I say that to this--

635
00:23:29.092 --> 00:23:30.160
<v Blonde woman>Is that because of a reduction</v>

636
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.129
in the sheer anxiety, we've got a truck

637
00:23:32.129 --> 00:23:33.663
with us here, but that's okay.

638
00:23:33.663 --> 00:23:35.698
<v ->Yes, but it's the anxiety, and it's also</v>

639
00:23:35.698 --> 00:23:38.434
better quality lifestyle, less stress,

640
00:23:38.434 --> 00:23:40.738
better healthcare, everything.

641
00:23:41.805 --> 00:23:43.141
What's interesting is the very people,

642
00:23:43.141 --> 00:23:44.374
I was speaking at a church one time,

643
00:23:44.374 --> 00:23:45.909
and I speak at churches a lot,

644
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:47.477
and this church, this lady came up to me,

645
00:23:47.477 --> 00:23:50.213
and she says, "You know, I'm not greedy."

646
00:23:50.213 --> 00:23:52.282
And I said, "And how do you say that?"

647
00:23:52.282 --> 00:23:53.783
She says, "Well, I'm not in it for the money."

648
00:23:53.783 --> 00:23:56.453
And I said, "Oh," I said, "money's bad."

649
00:23:56.453 --> 00:23:59.156
And I said, "Oh, is that the reason

650
00:23:59.156 --> 00:24:01.192
"that you're at my financial seminar here at the church?"

651
00:24:01.192 --> 00:24:02.593
(Blonde woman laughs)

652
00:24:02.593 --> 00:24:05.728
And she says "Oh" and she just walked off.

653
00:24:05.728 --> 00:24:09.266
And i watched these, I guess, preprogrammed

654
00:24:09.266 --> 00:24:11.234
belief systems that are injected into people

655
00:24:11.234 --> 00:24:13.703
and it's self sabotaging because that woman

656
00:24:13.703 --> 00:24:15.238
with that belief system is never gonna do it

657
00:24:15.238 --> 00:24:16.239
'cause she'll feel guilty and bad

658
00:24:16.239 --> 00:24:18.308
if she ever does have any money.

659
00:24:18.308 --> 00:24:20.610
But what's interesting is the people who say

660
00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:22.413
I'm not in it for the money are the ones

661
00:24:22.413 --> 00:24:24.347
that will work their whole life for money

662
00:24:24.347 --> 00:24:26.516
because they never learn to save.

663
00:24:26.516 --> 00:24:28.619
And so they'll work their whole life as a slave for money

664
00:24:28.619 --> 00:24:31.221
and money will be the thing that they'll have to depend on.

665
00:24:31.221 --> 00:24:33.523
But the person who learns how to save,

666
00:24:33.523 --> 00:24:35.458
and values money, will eventually have

667
00:24:35.458 --> 00:24:36.827
money working for them.

668
00:24:36.827 --> 00:24:40.230
They are its master, they are not its slave.

669
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.864
And so saving money is actually a spiritual quest

670
00:24:42.864 --> 00:24:44.135
because what it does, it allows you to

671
00:24:44.135 --> 00:24:46.335
not have it run your life, but to direct it

672
00:24:46.335 --> 00:24:48.872
with your intentions and your spiritual calling,

673
00:24:48.872 --> 00:24:50.440
and the people that're in destitution

674
00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.910
are having to work every day to try to get by,

675
00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:55.479
and their focus is the money.

676
00:24:55.479 --> 00:24:57.013
So it's sort of paradoxical.

677
00:24:57.013 --> 00:24:58.214
<v Blonde woman>It is very much, yes--</v>

678
00:24:58.214 --> 00:25:00.016
<v ->And I try to teach people to integrate those,</v>

679
00:25:00.016 --> 00:25:02.419
to have a spiritual calling, a spiritual mission,

680
00:25:02.419 --> 00:25:04.454
and have a material understanding

681
00:25:04.454 --> 00:25:05.488
so you can integrate the two,

682
00:25:05.488 --> 00:25:06.856
because how are you going to create

683
00:25:06.856 --> 00:25:09.292
in the material world with your spiritual vision

684
00:25:09.292 --> 00:25:11.394
if you don't know the laws that govern it?

685
00:25:11.394 --> 00:25:12.461
<v Blonde woman>So I guess to get down</v>

686
00:25:12.461 --> 00:25:14.731
to the ABCs one, two, threes, and all that,

687
00:25:14.731 --> 00:25:17.401
it's best because we only have so much time here

688
00:25:17.401 --> 00:25:19.169
for people to pick up a copy of the book,

689
00:25:19.169 --> 00:25:21.971
which of course we'll remind them about on the website too.

690
00:25:21.971 --> 00:25:24.740
And is there anything else you'd like to add

691
00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.077
to the subject right now of material wealth

692
00:25:27.077 --> 00:25:29.446
before we get onto I Gave Up On Happiness?

693
00:25:29.446 --> 00:25:31.380
(both laugh) Thought we'd do a two-for here.

694
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.583
<v ->You know, if people will wait,</v>

695
00:25:33.583 --> 00:25:35.951
most people are waiting for the big kill

696
00:25:35.951 --> 00:25:37.688
before they save,

697
00:25:37.688 --> 00:25:40.758
and my experience is it's not how much you save

698
00:25:40.758 --> 00:25:42.224
it's the habit of saving.

699
00:25:42.224 --> 00:25:44.028
If they will just take their piggy banks

700
00:25:44.028 --> 00:25:46.028
and stay with the savings process

701
00:25:46.028 --> 00:25:48.165
the piggy banks will become biggie banks.

702
00:25:48.165 --> 00:25:49.766
And you know when I first started saving

703
00:25:49.766 --> 00:25:51.301
I saved a very small amount,

704
00:25:51.301 --> 00:25:52.937
and every quarter, every three months

705
00:25:52.937 --> 00:25:55.239
after I got the habit of saving what i was saving

706
00:25:55.239 --> 00:25:57.774
I just increased it between one and 10%.

707
00:25:57.774 --> 00:26:00.411
And little by little I noticed that as I started to save

708
00:26:00.411 --> 00:26:02.211
I attracted more opportunities,

709
00:26:02.211 --> 00:26:04.147
more business, more service,

710
00:26:04.147 --> 00:26:06.115
more people wanted to interact with me.

711
00:26:06.115 --> 00:26:08.651
It's quite interesting, when you have a dollar saved

712
00:26:08.651 --> 00:26:10.187
you hang out with dollar-aires.

713
00:26:10.187 --> 00:26:11.588
When you have a thousand dollars saved

714
00:26:11.588 --> 00:26:13.090
you hang out with thousand-aires.

715
00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:13.957
If you have a million dollars saved

716
00:26:13.957 --> 00:26:15.625
you hang out with millionaires.

717
00:26:15.625 --> 00:26:17.360
When you start to save you get to hang out

718
00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.296
with people that have broader influence

719
00:26:19.296 --> 00:26:20.698
and so now your spiritual calling

720
00:26:20.698 --> 00:26:22.398
can now reach more people.

721
00:26:22.398 --> 00:26:24.700
And so the value is just to save,

722
00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:25.701
and I think that's the message

723
00:26:25.701 --> 00:26:28.338
of spirituality anyway, is to be saved in that respect.

724
00:26:28.338 --> 00:26:29.674
So I think maybe that's the reminder,

725
00:26:29.674 --> 00:26:30.941
and every time you open a computer,

726
00:26:30.941 --> 00:26:32.684
and before you close it down, you've got to learn to

727
00:26:32.684 --> 00:26:33.710
save.
<v Blonde woman>Save.</v>

728
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:35.713
<v ->So if there's any message I want to bring to people</v>

729
00:26:35.713 --> 00:26:36.779
when it comes to economics is,

730
00:26:36.779 --> 00:26:38.481
no matter how much money you make

731
00:26:38.481 --> 00:26:39.417
save a portion of it.

732
00:26:39.417 --> 00:26:40.784
If you can save 10%,

733
00:26:40.784 --> 00:26:43.087
you have financial independence in your reach.

734
00:26:43.087 --> 00:26:44.721
But if you don't, you're probably gonna be

735
00:26:44.721 --> 00:26:46.590
dependent on somebody else in your life,

736
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:48.592
and nobody dreams about that.

737
00:26:48.592 --> 00:26:49.852
<v Blonde woman>Well what you're saying is almost</v>

738
00:26:49.852 --> 00:26:52.161
anti-American, they're saying spend, spend, spend,

739
00:26:52.161 --> 00:26:53.095
in fact, do it on credit.

740
00:26:53.095 --> 00:26:54.131
<v ->Well, when everybody is spending,</v>

741
00:26:54.131 --> 00:26:55.897
the wise person's saving,

742
00:26:55.897 --> 00:26:58.534
and then when everybody is now destitute and has to save

743
00:26:58.534 --> 00:27:00.638
then that person is able to spend.

744
00:27:00.638 --> 00:27:02.271
<v Blonde woman>Yeah, and what is your comment on this?</v>

745
00:27:02.271 --> 00:27:04.640
I mean the credit industry?

746
00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.410
By the time, you haven't even graduated from college

747
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:09.345
the come-ons are coming in by the day.

748
00:27:09.345 --> 00:27:10.681
<v ->Well, I'd like to say something about that</v>

749
00:27:10.681 --> 00:27:12.983
because if you allow yourself to get into debt

750
00:27:12.983 --> 00:27:15.551
to start a business, to reap the rewards of that

751
00:27:15.551 --> 00:27:16.953
then that's understandable.

752
00:27:16.953 --> 00:27:19.390
But if you're in debt, make sure you take

753
00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:21.824
the amount of debt that you're paying every month

754
00:27:21.824 --> 00:27:23.526
and break it down per week,

755
00:27:23.526 --> 00:27:24.794
the amount it would be a week,

756
00:27:24.794 --> 00:27:26.663
break it down to what it would be per day,

757
00:27:26.663 --> 00:27:28.464
break it down even to hour.

758
00:27:28.464 --> 00:27:30.801
And then convert whatever that debt is per hour

759
00:27:30.801 --> 00:27:34.537
into units of service, or products that you sell,

760
00:27:34.537 --> 00:27:36.740
and then focus on service.

761
00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:38.675
Because if you focus on converting that to service

762
00:27:38.675 --> 00:27:41.311
and focus on serving people the debt will disappear.

763
00:27:41.311 --> 00:27:43.379
But if you focus on your debt out of anxiety

764
00:27:43.379 --> 00:27:44.882
the service will disappear.

765
00:27:44.882 --> 00:27:47.149
People can tell when your focus is on the finances

766
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:48.918
and not the service to them.

767
00:27:48.918 --> 00:27:51.254
When you are present, and spiritually present

768
00:27:51.254 --> 00:27:53.423
and you're certain about your service with other people

769
00:27:53.423 --> 00:27:54.354
and you serve them,

770
00:27:54.354 --> 00:27:55.875
the money takes care of itself that way.

771
00:27:57.527 --> 00:27:59.395
<v Blonde woman>Well, thank you for that.</v>

772
00:27:59.395 --> 00:28:01.197
That's, I mean there's, I'll go back

773
00:28:01.197 --> 00:28:02.665
and watch this one myself.

774
00:28:02.665 --> 00:28:04.834
A lot of gems in there.

775
00:28:04.834 --> 00:28:08.604
And along that line, you mentioned a little bit ago,

776
00:28:08.604 --> 00:28:10.172
it's our hierarchy of values

777
00:28:10.172 --> 00:28:12.076
are very different from each other.

778
00:28:12.076 --> 00:28:13.943
For some people it's family, or art,

779
00:28:13.943 --> 00:28:16.312
or whatnot, and for other people

780
00:28:16.312 --> 00:28:19.248
it may be more financial security oriented.

781
00:28:19.248 --> 00:28:22.718
And I like this book, the working title you have,

782
00:28:22.718 --> 00:28:24.187
or is this the finished title,

783
00:28:24.187 --> 00:28:27.881
I Gave Up On Happiness, It Made Me Too Sad (both laugh)

784
00:28:27.881 --> 00:28:29.839
That's coming out shortly.
<v Dr. Demartini>Yes, I have</v>

785
00:28:29.839 --> 00:28:32.295
a seminar that I do on that topic,

786
00:28:32.295 --> 00:28:33.796
and it draws attention.

787
00:28:33.796 --> 00:28:34.897
<v Blonde woman>It does draw attention.</v>

788
00:28:34.897 --> 00:28:37.969
So it sounds like it's a country western song, first of all.

789
00:28:37.969 --> 00:28:40.137
I Gave Up On Happiness, It Made Me Too Sad.

790
00:28:40.137 --> 00:28:41.471
<v ->Maybe if you read my book in reverse</v>

791
00:28:41.471 --> 00:28:44.140
you'll get all kinds of relationships. (Blonde woman laughs)

792
00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.708
<v Blonde woman>So what is this all about?</v>

793
00:28:45.708 --> 00:28:47.477
<v ->Well, the reason that title, I mean,</v>

794
00:28:47.477 --> 00:28:51.114
It's kind of, it's thought provoking,

795
00:28:51.114 --> 00:28:54.185
but i watch, and I consult people, and counsel people,

796
00:28:54.185 --> 00:28:56.952
and I watch a lot of people, in relationships particularly,

797
00:28:56.952 --> 00:28:59.056
or in any area of their life, they're searching

798
00:28:59.056 --> 00:29:02.458
for this kind of a pie-in-the-sky fantasy.

799
00:29:02.458 --> 00:29:04.561
I define a fantasy as a pleasure without a pain

800
00:29:04.561 --> 00:29:06.527
and a nightmare a pain without a pleasure,

801
00:29:06.527 --> 00:29:08.665
and they're looking in life for a pleasure without a pain,

802
00:29:08.665 --> 00:29:10.634
a happy without a sad, a nice without a mean,

803
00:29:10.634 --> 00:29:13.402
a kind without a cruel, a support without a challenge.

804
00:29:13.402 --> 00:29:16.038
You know, kind of a calm without turmoil,

805
00:29:16.038 --> 00:29:18.874
and they're looking for a one-sided magnet,

806
00:29:18.874 --> 00:29:21.144
and I like to think that everything an event.

807
00:29:21.144 --> 00:29:24.314
In quantum physics everything is an event of neutral

808
00:29:24.314 --> 00:29:26.317
until we project our values and measure it

809
00:29:26.317 --> 00:29:28.617
as one or the other, positive or negative.

810
00:29:28.617 --> 00:29:30.286
And what happens is every event

811
00:29:30.286 --> 00:29:31.854
has a pair of opposites,

812
00:29:31.854 --> 00:29:33.423
so if we think it's gonna be supportive

813
00:29:33.423 --> 00:29:34.625
there's also a hidden challenge.

814
00:29:34.625 --> 00:29:36.626
We may not see it at first, we may be infatuated

815
00:29:36.626 --> 00:29:38.194
and elated, but then we eventually discover

816
00:29:38.194 --> 00:29:39.561
what the challenge was.

817
00:29:39.561 --> 00:29:41.531
And we may think this is a terrible thing and a challenge,

818
00:29:41.531 --> 00:29:42.599
but we eventually discover out

819
00:29:42.599 --> 00:29:44.500
the terrifics and benefits out of it.

820
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.070
So nature has a pair of opposites,

821
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.138
so any time we're searching

822
00:29:48.138 --> 00:29:51.240
for one-sided magnets it's futile.

823
00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.108
<v Blonde woman>Now this would get into</v>

824
00:29:52.108 --> 00:29:53.476
relationships right quick, right?

825
00:29:53.476 --> 00:29:54.478
<v ->Yes, because what happens is</v>

826
00:29:54.478 --> 00:29:56.312
it's like trying to find a monopole,

827
00:29:56.312 --> 00:29:58.247
a one-sided pole of a magnet.

828
00:29:58.247 --> 00:29:59.315
You can cut the magnet in half

829
00:29:59.315 --> 00:30:00.250
and try to get the positive pole,

830
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:01.484
but you then get two magnets

831
00:30:01.484 --> 00:30:02.818
with positive, negatives.

832
00:30:02.818 --> 00:30:04.788
And this is the futility that people are searching for.

833
00:30:04.788 --> 00:30:06.923
They're setting themselves up for fantasies,

834
00:30:06.923 --> 00:30:09.558
and the fantasy is the source of their broken hearts.

835
00:30:09.558 --> 00:30:11.762
Their fantasies are the source of their depressions

836
00:30:11.762 --> 00:30:15.932
and bipolar conditions, and later post-traumatic conditions,

837
00:30:15.932 --> 00:30:18.434
'cause they have this expectation that is unrealistic

838
00:30:18.434 --> 00:30:20.971
and they set themselves up for the defeat.

839
00:30:20.971 --> 00:30:23.541
And I'm trying, in my book and in my seminar on this,

840
00:30:23.541 --> 00:30:24.707
I'm trying to make sure that people

841
00:30:24.707 --> 00:30:28.078
set reasonable goals that match their values

842
00:30:28.078 --> 00:30:29.446
that are something that're obtainable

843
00:30:29.446 --> 00:30:31.213
so they don't set themselves up defeat,

844
00:30:31.213 --> 00:30:34.350
so they practice themselves honoring their accomplishments.

845
00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:35.985
<v Blonde woman>So how does this filter down</v>

846
00:30:35.985 --> 00:30:39.190
into relationships, and let's say specifically

847
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:40.890
intimate relationships between people.

848
00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:43.793
I mean, you've already alluded to it, to an extent, but.

849
00:30:43.793 --> 00:30:45.895
<v ->Well, every individual, as you know</v>

850
00:30:45.895 --> 00:30:49.265
has a set of values, and so if you ever expect them

851
00:30:49.265 --> 00:30:52.068
to live anything else but their values

852
00:30:52.068 --> 00:30:54.004
you set yourself up for a fantasy,

853
00:30:54.004 --> 00:30:55.337
and this happens in every relationship

854
00:30:55.337 --> 00:30:56.672
just about I see.

855
00:30:56.672 --> 00:30:58.207
People are sitting there, getting into a relationship.

856
00:30:58.207 --> 00:30:59.577
They both had a set of values,

857
00:30:59.577 --> 00:31:00.677
whatever's most important on them

858
00:31:00.677 --> 00:31:02.378
they try to get the other person to do.

859
00:31:02.378 --> 00:31:04.178
This person over here tries to get them to do,

860
00:31:04.178 --> 00:31:05.982
and by the way if any two people are exactly the same,

861
00:31:05.982 --> 00:31:08.084
one's not necessary.

862
00:31:08.084 --> 00:31:09.786
So what they do is they spend their lives

863
00:31:09.786 --> 00:31:11.155
trying to fix the other person,

864
00:31:11.155 --> 00:31:13.690
and they think that the person has potential.

865
00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:14.890
Whenever you hear somebody say,

866
00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:16.193
"Well, oh, this guy's got potential.

867
00:31:16.193 --> 00:31:17.561
"This person's got potential."

868
00:31:17.561 --> 00:31:19.429
What that means is that I'm dedicated

869
00:31:19.429 --> 00:31:22.264
to changing them into my value systems

870
00:31:22.264 --> 00:31:23.866
and the potential is the difference between

871
00:31:23.866 --> 00:31:26.069
them, as they are, and the difference

872
00:31:26.069 --> 00:31:28.439
of what I expect from them.

873
00:31:28.439 --> 00:31:29.306
And this is doomed, this is automatically,

874
00:31:29.306 --> 00:31:30.839
because people just want to be loved

875
00:31:30.839 --> 00:31:33.577
for who they are, not for what you expect from them.

876
00:31:33.577 --> 00:31:35.646
So you have to start in a relationship

877
00:31:35.646 --> 00:31:37.915
right off the bat knowing that the only thing

878
00:31:37.915 --> 00:31:39.516
you're going to expect from that individual

879
00:31:39.516 --> 00:31:41.017
is for them to live their values.

880
00:31:41.017 --> 00:31:44.654
Unless you learn the art of caring,

881
00:31:44.654 --> 00:31:46.055
which is the art of communicating

882
00:31:46.055 --> 00:31:48.558
what's important to you, what's highest important to you

883
00:31:48.558 --> 00:31:51.228
in terms of what's most important to them.

884
00:31:51.228 --> 00:31:53.296
And it's like a sales process, if you--

885
00:31:53.296 --> 00:31:55.265
<v Blonde woman>Give a good example of this.</v>

886
00:31:55.265 --> 00:31:58.134
<v ->Okay, let me give you a story and example.</v>

887
00:31:58.134 --> 00:32:02.038
Okay, let's say I'm with a wife and husband,

888
00:32:02.038 --> 00:32:03.505
and I'll use my own example,

889
00:32:03.505 --> 00:32:05.509
'cause I was previously married with Athena,

890
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:07.176
who has passed away now.

891
00:32:07.176 --> 00:32:09.712
But what happened is I was getting ready

892
00:32:09.712 --> 00:32:10.946
to go on a tour for a month,

893
00:32:10.946 --> 00:32:12.282
traveling in a number of countries

894
00:32:12.282 --> 00:32:14.383
in Africa, and Asia and things,

895
00:32:14.383 --> 00:32:16.186
and I said to Athena, I said,

896
00:32:16.186 --> 00:32:18.253
"Well, I'm about to go on my tour."

897
00:32:18.253 --> 00:32:22.325
And if I was to go up to her and say, well, high five,

898
00:32:22.325 --> 00:32:24.944
see you later babe, I'll call you if I get a chance,

899
00:32:26.462 --> 00:32:28.031
you know, I'll see you when,

900
00:32:28.031 --> 00:32:30.200
she would be not there when I got back.

901
00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.600
But if I go up to her and I say,

902
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.804
"Look, I'm going back on my tour again."

903
00:32:34.804 --> 00:32:36.974
I put arms, and I hold her,

904
00:32:36.974 --> 00:32:40.410
and I said, "I'll be thinking about you every day,

905
00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:44.613
"and I love you, and I was just wondering,

906
00:32:44.613 --> 00:32:47.117
"I noticed that next month when I'm

907
00:32:47.117 --> 00:32:50.953
"actually finishing my tour that it's full moon,

908
00:32:50.953 --> 00:32:52.255
"and I was just wondering if there's any way

909
00:32:52.255 --> 00:32:53.956
"you could meet me in Venice.

910
00:32:53.956 --> 00:32:57.427
"'Cause what I imagine is going down the Grand Ganal

911
00:32:57.427 --> 00:33:01.330
"underneath the Rialto, holding arms with a blanket,

912
00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:03.500
"in the gondola and just going

913
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.368
"and being together on the full moon.

914
00:33:05.368 --> 00:33:09.005
"And then turning left down one of the canals,

915
00:33:09.005 --> 00:33:11.975
"and helping you off the gondola onto the steps,

916
00:33:11.975 --> 00:33:14.878
"and then walking through the nice walkways,

917
00:33:14.878 --> 00:33:17.079
"and seeing Gucci, and seeing Versace,

918
00:33:17.079 --> 00:33:20.984
"and seeing all the brands as we go into San Marco's Square,

919
00:33:20.984 --> 00:33:22.885
" and we listen to the violins in concert."

920
00:33:22.885 --> 00:33:25.023
<v Blonde woman>Well hello, what did she say? (laughs)</v>

921
00:33:25.023 --> 00:33:26.723
<v ->I'd imagine that, and then what I'd do</v>

922
00:33:26.723 --> 00:33:29.559
is listen to that have and have a cappuccino and Perrier,

923
00:33:29.559 --> 00:33:31.960
and then going to the Europa &amp; Regina Hotel

924
00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.798
and having a massage, a male for you,

925
00:33:34.798 --> 00:33:36.633
and female for me, and getting all oiled up

926
00:33:36.633 --> 00:33:39.134
and then make passionate love and then maybe

927
00:33:39.134 --> 00:33:42.038
a shower together, and the next morning go shopping.

928
00:33:42.038 --> 00:33:43.406
And I was just wondering if there was any way

929
00:33:43.406 --> 00:33:44.908
you could meet me in Venice, honey?

930
00:33:44.908 --> 00:33:46.576
(Blonde woman giggles)

931
00:33:46.576 --> 00:33:48.944
And she'll say, "I thank you for working so hard.

932
00:33:48.944 --> 00:33:50.680
"I love you honey, I'll make all the arrangements.

933
00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.281
"I'll see you there."

934
00:33:52.281 --> 00:33:54.684
If I'm communicating in her values

935
00:33:54.684 --> 00:33:56.419
I can go, I have my freedom

936
00:33:56.419 --> 00:33:58.053
to go and do what I love to do,

937
00:33:58.053 --> 00:33:59.389
to travel and to speak,

938
00:33:59.389 --> 00:34:02.492
and then have a very romantic rendezvous.

939
00:34:02.492 --> 00:34:04.359
But if I don't, then what happens is

940
00:34:04.359 --> 00:34:05.762
I'm getting friction in the relationship

941
00:34:05.762 --> 00:34:07.463
because I'm projecting my values onto her

942
00:34:07.463 --> 00:34:08.864
instead of honoring hers.

943
00:34:08.864 --> 00:34:10.367
<v Blonde woman>So how does that kind of conversation</v>

944
00:34:10.367 --> 00:34:13.469
generally go between an average couple.

945
00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:15.270
<v ->Well, an average couple, because they're</v>

946
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:17.306
ignorant of the other person,

947
00:34:17.306 --> 00:34:19.375
and they're careless about the other person

948
00:34:19.375 --> 00:34:21.477
they expect their values to be met

949
00:34:21.477 --> 00:34:23.445
and they project those onto another person,

950
00:34:23.445 --> 00:34:24.948
and the other person is doing the same

951
00:34:24.948 --> 00:34:28.051
and so they have alternating monologues, not dialogues.

952
00:34:28.051 --> 00:34:29.818
And what they do is they fight,

953
00:34:29.818 --> 00:34:31.154
and they're constantly trying to change

954
00:34:31.154 --> 00:34:34.091
and they have these, they keep, see, Microsoft,

955
00:34:34.091 --> 00:34:36.258
and the computer industry does not have a memory system,

956
00:34:36.258 --> 00:34:37.526
or Intel does not have a memory system

957
00:34:37.526 --> 00:34:40.297
as effective as a man and woman's remembrance

958
00:34:40.297 --> 00:34:42.698
of everything that went against their values.

959
00:34:42.698 --> 00:34:44.800
And they will download that the second they get

960
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.101
their buttons pushed strong enough

961
00:34:46.101 --> 00:34:48.004
as a capacitor discharging energy,

962
00:34:48.004 --> 00:34:49.639
they'll download every memory that they

963
00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:52.275
have not been feeling supported by.

964
00:34:52.275 --> 00:34:54.945
So what happens is they just store up all this tension

965
00:34:54.945 --> 00:34:57.180
and all this anger of their values not being met

966
00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:59.316
because they have false expectations.

967
00:34:59.316 --> 00:35:00.749
And this is what my book is about,

968
00:35:00.749 --> 00:35:01.950
and the seminar's about,

969
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:04.786
making sure that you only set up your expectations

970
00:35:04.786 --> 00:35:05.722
around other people according

971
00:35:05.722 --> 00:35:07.156
to what their true values are,

972
00:35:07.156 --> 00:35:09.225
because otherwise you have betrayal.

973
00:35:09.225 --> 00:35:11.327
And see, the person's never really committed to you,

974
00:35:11.327 --> 00:35:13.529
I know that sounds kind of challenging.

975
00:35:13.529 --> 00:35:15.664
They're only committed to their values,

976
00:35:15.664 --> 00:35:17.267
and if you understand that, and realize

977
00:35:17.267 --> 00:35:19.035
that you're always in competition with

978
00:35:19.035 --> 00:35:20.536
other people in the marketplace,

979
00:35:20.536 --> 00:35:22.072
and if you can communicate in their values

980
00:35:22.072 --> 00:35:23.673
more effective than anybody else

981
00:35:23.673 --> 00:35:25.474
they stay with you for a lifetime.

982
00:35:25.474 --> 00:35:27.009
But if you don't, somebody else

983
00:35:27.009 --> 00:35:28.911
may come along with a better mousetrap,

984
00:35:28.911 --> 00:35:30.614
and they go off with somebody else.

985
00:35:30.614 --> 00:35:32.381
<v Blonde woman>Yeah, because the subject of betrayal,</v>

986
00:35:32.381 --> 00:35:34.449
as you just mentioned, is often really

987
00:35:34.449 --> 00:35:35.818
what you've set up in your own mind.

988
00:35:35.818 --> 00:35:37.620
You may feel betrayed, when in fact

989
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:39.823
that person has just adhered to their own--

990
00:35:39.823 --> 00:35:41.490
<v ->They're just being themselves.</v>

991
00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:43.226
People just want to be loved for who they are,

992
00:35:43.226 --> 00:35:44.393
and if you're not able to do it,

993
00:35:44.393 --> 00:35:45.594
and you keep wanting to change them

994
00:35:45.594 --> 00:35:47.462
and keep having false expectations,

995
00:35:47.462 --> 00:35:49.865
they're looking for somebody who'll love them.

996
00:35:49.865 --> 00:35:50.899
<v Blonde woman>What about the other issue</v>

997
00:35:50.899 --> 00:35:53.835
where you're not necessarily trying to,

998
00:35:53.835 --> 00:35:55.571
say, change the other person,

999
00:35:55.571 --> 00:35:58.077
but instead you're romanticizing,

1000
00:35:58.077 --> 00:36:01.243
or over inflating a person's value system.

1001
00:36:01.243 --> 00:36:03.247
<v ->Now the other side, which is called</v>

1002
00:36:03.247 --> 00:36:06.181
the fantasy, or the putting them on a pedestal,

1003
00:36:06.181 --> 00:36:08.417
whoever you put on a pedestal, over time

1004
00:36:08.417 --> 00:36:10.085
you will end up putting in the pit.

1005
00:36:10.085 --> 00:36:11.887
Because the very person you put on a pedestal

1006
00:36:11.887 --> 00:36:14.158
you will sacrifice your life doing it,

1007
00:36:14.158 --> 00:36:16.558
with that infatuation, and eventually resent

1008
00:36:16.558 --> 00:36:17.659
not doing the things you really

1009
00:36:17.659 --> 00:36:19.328
love to do for your own life.

1010
00:36:19.328 --> 00:36:20.629
And eventually you'll resent that

1011
00:36:20.629 --> 00:36:22.331
and destroy the relationship.

1012
00:36:22.331 --> 00:36:24.634
So if you put people on pedestals you'll put them in pits,

1013
00:36:24.634 --> 00:36:25.836
and the secret is neither one,

1014
00:36:25.836 --> 00:36:27.736
but to put them in your heart.

1015
00:36:27.736 --> 00:36:30.106
And so I would say, it's interesting,

1016
00:36:30.106 --> 00:36:32.141
in studying dynamics of relationships,

1017
00:36:32.141 --> 00:36:34.010
the person who's the underdog,

1018
00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:36.279
who's got the infatuation for the overdog

1019
00:36:36.279 --> 00:36:38.314
is the person who wants to tie the person down.

1020
00:36:38.314 --> 00:36:40.917
That's where it originates, the term tying down.

1021
00:36:40.917 --> 00:36:42.619
And they're the ones that want the monogamy,

1022
00:36:42.619 --> 00:36:43.753
and they want the constraint,

1023
00:36:43.753 --> 00:36:44.921
and they're the ones who're jealous,

1024
00:36:44.921 --> 00:36:46.354
and they're the ones that want to call,

1025
00:36:46.354 --> 00:36:48.323
and run that person's life, and make sure

1026
00:36:48.323 --> 00:36:50.159
they're not away from them.

1027
00:36:50.159 --> 00:36:52.563
The person who's the overdog, who's the confident one,

1028
00:36:52.563 --> 00:36:55.265
who has empowerment is wanting their freedom,

1029
00:36:55.265 --> 00:36:57.400
and they're the ones who want to let loose

1030
00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.034
and not be tied down.

1031
00:36:59.034 --> 00:37:02.007
So if a person is wanting to get married to somebody

1032
00:37:02.007 --> 00:37:05.074
and they have somebody they've got on this pedestal,

1033
00:37:05.074 --> 00:37:07.710
the best thing they can do is empower their life.

1034
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:09.745
Go strengthen all seven areas of life,

1035
00:37:09.745 --> 00:37:11.547
their spiritual, their mental, their career,

1036
00:37:11.547 --> 00:37:12.780
their financial, their family,

1037
00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.349
their social, their physical.

1038
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:19.054
To become such a package that no man would want to leave.

1039
00:37:19.054 --> 00:37:21.458
I have to share this story, it's a good story.

1040
00:37:21.458 --> 00:37:23.559
I was in Calgary, and I was doing

1041
00:37:23.559 --> 00:37:25.228
a relationships program there

1042
00:37:25.228 --> 00:37:26.729
and there was a lovely lady there

1043
00:37:26.729 --> 00:37:29.665
that put her hand up, and she was with her boyfriend,

1044
00:37:29.665 --> 00:37:33.236
and she says, "What do you do with a man who can't commit?"

1045
00:37:33.236 --> 00:37:36.105
And I said, "Well, you go and empower yourself

1046
00:37:36.105 --> 00:37:37.440
"because you obviously aren't a package

1047
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.509
"that he's ready to invest in."

1048
00:37:39.509 --> 00:37:41.043
And she just kind of huffed a bit,

1049
00:37:41.043 --> 00:37:42.577
and I walked over to her and I said,

1050
00:37:42.577 --> 00:37:44.847
"So what do you have to offer this man?"

1051
00:37:44.847 --> 00:37:46.816
And I confronted her, because she was being cocky,

1052
00:37:46.816 --> 00:37:47.716
and of course when you're cocky,

1053
00:37:47.716 --> 00:37:49.301
you get challenged.

1054
00:37:50.252 --> 00:37:52.455
So I said to her, "So are you some sort of

1055
00:37:52.455 --> 00:37:55.191
"spiritual goddess, and have great spiritual radiance,

1056
00:37:55.191 --> 00:37:56.859
"and some illumination, and great spiritual

1057
00:37:56.859 --> 00:37:58.294
"wisdom that you're offering him?"

1058
00:37:58.294 --> 00:37:59.962
She goes, "Well, no.

1059
00:37:59.962 --> 00:38:00.663
"No, not really."

1060
00:38:00.663 --> 00:38:02.865
And I said, "Are you some sort of a mental genius,

1061
00:38:02.865 --> 00:38:04.465
"and I giant there, and do you have some

1062
00:38:04.465 --> 00:38:06.436
"mental capacities, a Harvard MBA,

1063
00:38:06.436 --> 00:38:08.271
"or some degree in some form,

1064
00:38:08.271 --> 00:38:10.640
"amazing intuition?"

1065
00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.392
"No, I dropped out of college."

1066
00:38:13.776 --> 00:38:15.412
I said, "Do you have a career success,

1067
00:38:15.412 --> 00:38:17.247
"that's got this big multi-national company

1068
00:38:17.247 --> 00:38:19.165
"or something that you're offering this gentleman?"

1069
00:38:20.048 --> 00:38:22.217
"No, I work as an assistant."

1070
00:38:22.217 --> 00:38:23.519
I said, "Do you have vast fortune,

1071
00:38:23.519 --> 00:38:25.087
"and a great dowry, and you have wealth

1072
00:38:25.087 --> 00:38:26.555
"and everything else, and he's gonna want

1073
00:38:26.555 --> 00:38:28.558
"to maybe take advantage of?"

1074
00:38:28.558 --> 00:38:29.993
"No, I'm in debt.

1075
00:38:29.993 --> 00:38:31.662
"Alright, do you have some sort of family stability,

1076
00:38:31.662 --> 00:38:35.209
"and are you just a very stable, and very connected

1077
00:38:35.209 --> 00:38:36.333
"woman in the family dynamics?"

1078
00:38:36.333 --> 00:38:38.800
And she says, "Well no, I've been through two divorces."

1079
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.202
I said, "Are you socially connected,

1080
00:38:40.202 --> 00:38:42.106
"and you've made a network that he would

1081
00:38:42.106 --> 00:38:44.406
"definitely benefit in his life from?"

1082
00:38:44.406 --> 00:38:45.841
"No, I live in a small town."

1083
00:38:45.841 --> 00:38:48.110
"Are you the most beautiful, and sexy woman

1084
00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:51.848
"that's basically hot to trot and he can't just be without."

1085
00:38:51.848 --> 00:38:53.515
"Well, I think we do okay."

1086
00:38:53.515 --> 00:38:55.317
I said, "Can you see your self-image of yourself,

1087
00:38:55.317 --> 00:38:57.152
"it's somewhat deflated."

1088
00:38:57.152 --> 00:38:57.886
And she goes, "Yeah."

1089
00:38:57.886 --> 00:38:59.120
And I said, "Well that's why he's treating you

1090
00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.955
"the way you are, 'cause the way you're treating yourself

1091
00:39:00.955 --> 00:39:03.112
"is the way he's gonna treat you.

1092
00:39:03.112 --> 00:39:05.994
And I said, "Come with me, 'cause this is not the true you,

1093
00:39:05.994 --> 00:39:07.697
"this is the you you've developed

1094
00:39:07.697 --> 00:39:09.699
"about yourself, believed about yourself."

1095
00:39:09.699 --> 00:39:11.767
So I took her over there and I did the Demartini method,

1096
00:39:11.767 --> 00:39:14.137
which is a method of asking quality questions

1097
00:39:14.137 --> 00:39:17.240
to extract out of a person a quality life.

1098
00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.609
And what was amazing is we sat down and said

1099
00:39:19.609 --> 00:39:22.044
where is your spiritual radiance, where is is?

1100
00:39:22.044 --> 00:39:22.811
What form is it in?

1101
00:39:22.811 --> 00:39:23.981
It's not missing.

1102
00:39:23.981 --> 00:39:26.114
You may be comparing yourself to other people's form

1103
00:39:26.114 --> 00:39:28.384
and minimizing yourself, but where is yours?

1104
00:39:28.384 --> 00:39:29.951
And we woke up her spiritual awareness

1105
00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:31.720
to where her spiritual power was.

1106
00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.923
We did that all the way around the wheel,

1107
00:39:33.923 --> 00:39:34.958
all seven areas of her life.

1108
00:39:34.958 --> 00:39:36.692
We sat and asked, where do you have business savvy,

1109
00:39:36.692 --> 00:39:37.693
where do you have intelligence,

1110
00:39:37.693 --> 00:39:40.162
where do you have power in your family?

1111
00:39:40.162 --> 00:39:41.864
And we woke it up to a point,

1112
00:39:41.864 --> 00:39:43.233
after two and a half hours of working with her

1113
00:39:43.233 --> 00:39:46.034
and people watching, where she goes,

1114
00:39:46.034 --> 00:39:48.338
"You know, maybe I better not rush this thing."

1115
00:39:48.338 --> 00:39:50.072
I said, "Can you see it right now

1116
00:39:50.072 --> 00:39:51.106
"that you're honoring yourself,

1117
00:39:51.106 --> 00:39:53.108
"and realizing that maybe you're infatuated,

1118
00:39:53.108 --> 00:39:55.978
"and infatuation is blind, and love sees true,

1119
00:39:55.978 --> 00:39:58.180
"and maybe now you're seeing both sides."

1120
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.717
Well the second she did that it was about time for lunch.

1121
00:40:00.717 --> 00:40:03.218
She went back over to him, they walked off together,

1122
00:40:03.218 --> 00:40:04.719
and he was doing the same method on her,

1123
00:40:04.719 --> 00:40:07.389
just looking at that benefits she had to offer him.

1124
00:40:07.389 --> 00:40:10.193
They went off to lunch, and during that hour at lunch

1125
00:40:10.193 --> 00:40:12.228
I came back from lunch and there was about

1126
00:40:12.228 --> 00:40:14.197
seven or eight women around her

1127
00:40:14.197 --> 00:40:15.163
and I walked over there and I said,

1128
00:40:15.163 --> 00:40:16.333
"What's goin' on over there?"

1129
00:40:16.333 --> 00:40:19.001
She held up a $28,000 diamond right.

1130
00:40:19.001 --> 00:40:20.002
(Blonde woman laughs)

1131
00:40:20.002 --> 00:40:21.603
Because, I went over there and asked him.

1132
00:40:21.603 --> 00:40:23.672
The men were as far away from there as possible

1133
00:40:23.672 --> 00:40:25.073
'cause they didn't want their girlfriends

1134
00:40:25.073 --> 00:40:26.476
or wives seeing this,

1135
00:40:26.476 --> 00:40:27.643
but the women were all gathered around

1136
00:40:27.643 --> 00:40:29.644
because they're drawn to the diamonds.

1137
00:40:29.644 --> 00:40:30.846
But I went over there and asked him

1138
00:40:30.846 --> 00:40:32.914
what is it that made you do that?

1139
00:40:32.914 --> 00:40:34.850
And he says, "Well, while you were working with her

1140
00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:37.419
"there was some sort of quantum energetic field

1141
00:40:37.419 --> 00:40:40.589
"that was changing, and I felt like, oh my God,

1142
00:40:40.589 --> 00:40:42.992
"if he talks to her, she may leave,

1143
00:40:42.992 --> 00:40:45.128
"and all of a sudden I realized how valuable she was,

1144
00:40:45.128 --> 00:40:47.931
"and I realized that this is the person for me."

1145
00:40:47.931 --> 00:40:50.599
And I said, 'cause it's kind of like the flee they follow,

1146
00:40:50.599 --> 00:40:51.734
follow they flee?

1147
00:40:51.734 --> 00:40:53.335
If you're desperate to get them they don't want you

1148
00:40:53.335 --> 00:40:54.836
'cause you're devaluing yourself,

1149
00:40:54.836 --> 00:40:56.738
but if you stand strong you're more likely

1150
00:40:56.738 --> 00:41:00.008
to have somebody that's empowered in your life.

1151
00:41:00.008 --> 00:41:02.845
So that was a perfect demonstration of honoring herself,

1152
00:41:02.845 --> 00:41:04.780
and acknowledging her magnificence and radiance,

1153
00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:06.682
and the result that comes from that.

1154
00:41:06.682 --> 00:41:08.284
And it wasn't an exaggeration of self,

1155
00:41:08.284 --> 00:41:10.185
it was just an honoring of one's self,

1156
00:41:10.185 --> 00:41:11.836
and that makes relationships bloom.

1157
00:41:13.055 --> 00:41:14.589
<v Blonde woman>And to get to that point we</v>

1158
00:41:14.589 --> 00:41:16.559
need to have a very clear communication

1159
00:41:16.559 --> 00:41:20.162
with our deepest form of intelligent spirit.

1160
00:41:20.162 --> 00:41:21.763
Everybody calls it something different.

1161
00:41:21.763 --> 00:41:23.799
You call it the inner voice, is that correct?

1162
00:41:23.799 --> 00:41:24.900
<v ->The inner voice, inner vision,</v>

1163
00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.803
the inner source, you can give many names.

1164
00:41:26.803 --> 00:41:28.036
<v Blonde woman>And it really doesn't</v>

1165
00:41:28.036 --> 00:41:28.904
matter what the name is,

1166
00:41:28.904 --> 00:41:31.441
but our very highest potential, our essence.

1167
00:41:31.441 --> 00:41:32.240
<v ->Yes.</v>

1168
00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.077
<v Blonde woman>And so, where does one begin that journey</v>

1169
00:41:35.077 --> 00:41:37.113
if they're not already clear on it.

1170
00:41:37.113 --> 00:41:38.914
<v ->Well, I would say the quality of our life's</v>

1171
00:41:38.914 --> 00:41:41.016
based on the quality of the questions we ask.

1172
00:41:41.016 --> 00:41:42.953
And we ask the most profound questions

1173
00:41:42.953 --> 00:41:44.953
when we're in a state of gratitude.

1174
00:41:44.953 --> 00:41:47.257
So what I ask people to do on a daily basis,

1175
00:41:47.257 --> 00:41:50.560
and I was asked this when I was four by my mother,

1176
00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.360
to count your blessings.

1177
00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.462
One of my earlier books was called

1178
00:41:53.462 --> 00:41:55.363
Count Your Blessings for that reason,

1179
00:41:55.363 --> 00:41:57.433
and what you do is you sit down,

1180
00:41:57.433 --> 00:42:00.270
okay, 'cause if you're not grateful for something

1181
00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:01.637
you stop yourself from having

1182
00:42:01.637 --> 00:42:03.373
more things to be grateful for.

1183
00:42:03.373 --> 00:42:04.673
But once you start in motion,

1184
00:42:04.673 --> 00:42:06.208
and think about what you are grateful for

1185
00:42:06.208 --> 00:42:08.177
you attract opportunities that become

1186
00:42:08.177 --> 00:42:09.511
even more grateful.

1187
00:42:09.511 --> 00:42:10.647
So what you do is you think about

1188
00:42:10.647 --> 00:42:12.748
what you're grateful for, and you make a list in your mind,

1189
00:42:12.748 --> 00:42:14.051
and you do it, and don't stop

1190
00:42:14.051 --> 00:42:16.285
until you get a tear of gratitude,

1191
00:42:16.285 --> 00:42:17.753
an inspirational tear.

1192
00:42:17.753 --> 00:42:18.920
Then what happens is you go inside

1193
00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:21.356
in a moment of silence, and a moment of presence,

1194
00:42:21.356 --> 00:42:24.126
and you ask yourself, alright, what's my guidance?

1195
00:42:24.126 --> 00:42:26.394
Because in, gratitude is the key

1196
00:42:26.394 --> 00:42:28.297
that opens up the gateway of the heart,

1197
00:42:28.297 --> 00:42:30.967
and allows love that's there, waiting to come out,

1198
00:42:30.967 --> 00:42:32.534
the light and love of the heart.

1199
00:42:32.534 --> 00:42:34.903
And when that comes out from that gratitude

1200
00:42:34.903 --> 00:42:38.040
the mind becomes crystal clear, and you have inspiration,

1201
00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.042
and the body becomes enthusiastic.

1202
00:42:40.042 --> 00:42:41.910
And in that you have the greatest creativity,

1203
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:44.913
the greatest inspirations, and the greatest guidance.

1204
00:42:44.913 --> 00:42:46.448
The inner voice and inner vision is able

1205
00:42:46.448 --> 00:42:49.017
to guide at that time, and that is empowering.

1206
00:42:49.017 --> 00:42:50.585
And what now happens is if you then

1207
00:42:50.585 --> 00:42:53.188
ask questions like, alright inner voice,

1208
00:42:53.188 --> 00:42:54.790
what's next, what's my mission,

1209
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:57.158
what's my vision, what am I here to do,

1210
00:42:57.158 --> 00:42:58.627
what am I dedicated to?

1211
00:42:58.627 --> 00:43:02.130
You get pure answer, and I do that daily.

1212
00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:04.734
I literally have books and volumes of communication

1213
00:43:04.734 --> 00:43:07.870
inwardly with myself, and that has guided my life

1214
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:08.937
and that's one of the most profound things

1215
00:43:08.937 --> 00:43:10.505
I've learned to do in life.

1216
00:43:10.505 --> 00:43:12.908
There was a book that was called Cosmic Consciousness

1217
00:43:12.908 --> 00:43:16.237
by Richard M. Bucke, that came out in 19,

1218
00:43:16.237 --> 00:43:18.113
yeah 1901 I think,

1219
00:43:18.113 --> 00:43:19.715
and it was written, and what it was

1220
00:43:19.715 --> 00:43:22.818
is a study of the 43 most illuminated people in history,

1221
00:43:22.818 --> 00:43:25.588
and what was the common threads of these great illuminates.

1222
00:43:25.588 --> 00:43:27.156
And from Christ, and the Buddha,

1223
00:43:27.156 --> 00:43:30.225
to Walt Whitman, to the great inspired poets and writers,

1224
00:43:30.225 --> 00:43:31.693
and they found one common thread,

1225
00:43:31.693 --> 00:43:33.896
that they all trusted their inner voice

1226
00:43:33.896 --> 00:43:36.832
and they all listened and dialoged with it on a daily basis.

1227
00:43:36.832 --> 00:43:40.637
And so in my observation, even CEOs of companies,

1228
00:43:40.637 --> 00:43:44.539
great leaders, when you get down, that's what they do.

1229
00:43:44.539 --> 00:43:46.842
And so I trust that, and I use it on a daily basis,

1230
00:43:46.842 --> 00:43:48.277
and I know if a person does that,

1231
00:43:48.277 --> 00:43:50.613
goes into a state of gratitude, goes inside,

1232
00:43:50.613 --> 00:43:52.113
asks questions to the inner voice

1233
00:43:52.113 --> 00:43:53.950
and writes the guidance down,

1234
00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:55.985
when the voice and vision on the inside

1235
00:43:55.985 --> 00:43:58.220
is more profound than all opinions on the outside you've

1236
00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:59.355
begun to master your life.
<v Blonde woman>That's the key,</v>

1237
00:43:59.355 --> 00:44:01.322
I was just going to ask next

1238
00:44:01.322 --> 00:44:02.491
when that voice is the one--

1239
00:44:02.491 --> 00:44:04.292
<v ->When we haven't learned to do that</v>

1240
00:44:04.292 --> 00:44:06.861
the outer directedness runs our life

1241
00:44:06.861 --> 00:44:08.731
and we subordinate ourselves to other people

1242
00:44:08.731 --> 00:44:10.565
which allows us to minimize

1243
00:44:10.565 --> 00:44:12.134
our radiance, and our shine,

1244
00:44:12.134 --> 00:44:13.668
and our magnificence, and keeps us

1245
00:44:13.668 --> 00:44:15.270
from standing strong as a leader,

1246
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:16.588
which is our destiny.

1247
00:44:18.239 --> 00:44:19.808
<v Blonde woman>And what you talked about a moment ago</v>

1248
00:44:19.808 --> 00:44:22.745
about feeling the gratitude until

1249
00:44:22.745 --> 00:44:27.416
a little tear forms is really key.

1250
00:44:27.416 --> 00:44:30.186
I think this is the missing part in a lot of people's

1251
00:44:30.186 --> 00:44:34.123
version of visioning is to create a picture in your head

1252
00:44:34.123 --> 00:44:36.125
and then think that's enough,

1253
00:44:36.125 --> 00:44:40.228
when in fact emotions, feelings,

1254
00:44:40.228 --> 00:44:44.033
do serve a purpose in the process of creation.

1255
00:44:44.033 --> 00:44:46.434
Can you talk about that just a little bit more?

1256
00:44:46.434 --> 00:44:48.470
You've already touched on it a few times,

1257
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:49.637
but maybe directly.

1258
00:44:49.637 --> 00:44:51.606
<v ->Well I say that feelings penetrate through barriers</v>

1259
00:44:51.606 --> 00:44:53.374
that no thoughts alone can travel,

1260
00:44:53.374 --> 00:44:55.944
so when you take a thought plus a feeling it has impact,

1261
00:44:55.944 --> 00:44:58.080
but there's different types of feelings.

1262
00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.548
And I'm gonna give something that's

1263
00:44:59.548 --> 00:45:01.016
maybe a little different here.

1264
00:45:01.016 --> 00:45:03.051
I say that you have emotional feelings,

1265
00:45:03.051 --> 00:45:06.154
which are polarized, happy, sad,

1266
00:45:06.154 --> 00:45:08.557
and then there's synthesized feelings,

1267
00:45:08.557 --> 00:45:09.792
which is gratitude, and love,

1268
00:45:09.792 --> 00:45:11.693
and inspiration, and enthusiasm,

1269
00:45:11.693 --> 00:45:13.295
which are poised, and present,

1270
00:45:13.295 --> 00:45:16.264
and balanced feelings, and there's a difference.

1271
00:45:16.264 --> 00:45:18.867
Emotional feelings will make you manic, or depressed,

1272
00:45:18.867 --> 00:45:21.236
but love is always a synthesis of opposites.

1273
00:45:21.236 --> 00:45:24.139
I define love as a synthesis and synchronicity

1274
00:45:24.139 --> 00:45:26.142
of complementary opposites.

1275
00:45:26.142 --> 00:45:28.711
So, in other words, in the Breakthrough Experience

1276
00:45:28.711 --> 00:45:31.247
which is a program I do using the Demartini method,

1277
00:45:31.247 --> 00:45:32.882
I've taken literally tens of thousands of people

1278
00:45:32.882 --> 00:45:34.649
through a process where they completely

1279
00:45:34.649 --> 00:45:37.920
balance their feelings, balance out their perceptions,

1280
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.388
and all of a sudden the tears come.

1281
00:45:40.388 --> 00:45:43.960
And it's not tears of sorrow, it's not tears of elation,

1282
00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.528
it's tears of grace, gratitude.

1283
00:45:46.528 --> 00:45:47.964
Grace is another way of saying

1284
00:45:47.964 --> 00:45:50.299
that human will now matches divine will,

1285
00:45:50.299 --> 00:45:52.835
and grace is gracias, or gratitude.

1286
00:45:52.835 --> 00:45:54.970
And that means that you see the order,

1287
00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:56.071
the implicate order of the universe

1288
00:45:56.071 --> 00:45:57.773
is now becoming evident.

1289
00:45:57.773 --> 00:45:59.307
And now you see the apparent order

1290
00:45:59.307 --> 00:46:01.377
beyond the chaos that you saw,

1291
00:46:01.377 --> 00:46:03.079
and now you're thankful for the order

1292
00:46:03.079 --> 00:46:04.283
and you realize there's nothing to fix,

1293
00:46:04.283 --> 00:46:05.547
there's nothing to change.

1294
00:46:05.547 --> 00:46:07.849
As long as we have the polarity of emotions

1295
00:46:07.849 --> 00:46:10.485
we're always wanting to change ourselves relative to others,

1296
00:46:10.485 --> 00:46:12.589
or change others relative to ourselves.

1297
00:46:12.589 --> 00:46:13.989
When we have that poised state,

1298
00:46:13.989 --> 00:46:15.257
there's nothing to change.

1299
00:46:15.257 --> 00:46:17.827
So we either have poise, or poison,

1300
00:46:17.827 --> 00:46:19.262
and the poise is where the grace is

1301
00:46:19.262 --> 00:46:20.162
and that's where we have our

1302
00:46:20.162 --> 00:46:22.397
spiritual bouquet awaken.

1303
00:46:22.397 --> 00:46:24.000
<v Blonde woman>And to come full circle,</v>

1304
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.801
if one were to establish, or define,

1305
00:46:26.801 --> 00:46:30.272
their hierarchy of values from that place

1306
00:46:30.272 --> 00:46:33.105
then you would have a really solid platfrom

1307
00:46:33.105 --> 00:46:34.110
to work from.

1308
00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:36.198
<v ->My whole purpose of the Breakthrough Experience</v>

1309
00:46:36.198 --> 00:46:37.413
is exactly that, to help people

1310
00:46:37.413 --> 00:46:39.448
have that experience, 'cause in that moment

1311
00:46:39.448 --> 00:46:42.684
that they have that, the values dissolve for a moment

1312
00:46:42.684 --> 00:46:44.485
'cause the values occur with positive and negative

1313
00:46:44.485 --> 00:46:45.588
and they're dissolved, and there's

1314
00:46:45.588 --> 00:46:47.288
a moment of unconditional love.

1315
00:46:47.288 --> 00:46:49.991
In that is where you have clarity of mission,

1316
00:46:49.991 --> 00:46:52.295
clarity of vision, clarity of the message,

1317
00:46:52.295 --> 00:46:54.262
and it's inspired and it's automatic.

1318
00:46:54.262 --> 00:46:55.698
It's like you're the channel now.

1319
00:46:55.698 --> 00:46:59.634
Now the universe and you are working together in the zone.

1320
00:46:59.634 --> 00:47:02.004
The second you go back into emotions and polarities again

1321
00:47:02.004 --> 00:47:04.340
and you minimize yourself relative to others

1322
00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:05.707
and subordinate yourself to them

1323
00:47:05.707 --> 00:47:07.877
and inject their values into your life,

1324
00:47:07.877 --> 00:47:09.711
or exaggerate yourself to others

1325
00:47:09.711 --> 00:47:11.813
and project your values onto them.

1326
00:47:11.813 --> 00:47:13.416
Either one of those is attempting

1327
00:47:13.416 --> 00:47:15.517
to make you go against your values,

1328
00:47:15.517 --> 00:47:16.851
or get others to go against their values

1329
00:47:16.851 --> 00:47:18.888
which is not an act of love.

1330
00:47:18.888 --> 00:47:20.288
So when we have a balanced perspective

1331
00:47:20.288 --> 00:47:21.524
and we see that everyone around us

1332
00:47:21.524 --> 00:47:24.493
is a reflection of us, and we have truly poised,

1333
00:47:24.493 --> 00:47:26.762
now we have the true spiritual state.

1334
00:47:26.762 --> 00:47:29.697
In that state, if we have a clear vision,

1335
00:47:29.697 --> 00:47:32.333
which occurs, and we hold that vision,

1336
00:47:32.333 --> 00:47:35.036
we are a creator, and we're a manifestor.

1337
00:47:35.036 --> 00:47:36.805
And what we do is we're inspired,

1338
00:47:36.805 --> 00:47:38.741
and enthusiastic to want to go and act

1339
00:47:38.741 --> 00:47:40.410
and take the action steps necessary,

1340
00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:42.210
'cause there's no procrastination in that state,

1341
00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:43.428
there's just loving acts.

1342
00:47:44.446 --> 00:47:46.014
<v Blonde woman>So really, number one priority</v>

1343
00:47:46.014 --> 00:47:49.751
before even saving, before your savings account,

1344
00:47:49.751 --> 00:47:52.756
should be having some sort of daily

1345
00:47:52.756 --> 00:47:54.957
moments of reflection, of gratitude,

1346
00:47:54.957 --> 00:47:57.294
of practice of some kind, even if it takes

1347
00:47:57.294 --> 00:47:58.694
only a couple of minutes.

1348
00:47:58.694 --> 00:48:00.162
<v ->My ritual in the morning before I leave</v>

1349
00:48:00.162 --> 00:48:01.796
one dream world into this dream world,

1350
00:48:01.796 --> 00:48:03.165
'cause I consider this just as much a dream world.

1351
00:48:03.165 --> 00:48:04.299
<v Blonde woman>That's right.</v>

1352
00:48:04.299 --> 00:48:06.634
<v ->That transition is done in a state of gratitude,</v>

1353
00:48:06.634 --> 00:48:08.937
so when that alarm goes off, if I haven't beat it up,

1354
00:48:08.937 --> 00:48:12.441
gotten up before it, I don't get out of bed

1355
00:48:12.441 --> 00:48:14.977
until I have that tear, and I start my day with it,

1356
00:48:14.977 --> 00:48:16.344
and I have a pad next to the bed

1357
00:48:16.344 --> 00:48:19.048
so I can write any inspired scribing notes there.

1358
00:48:19.048 --> 00:48:20.148
And I start my day that way,

1359
00:48:20.148 --> 00:48:23.419
then I get onto my computer and I update my mission.

1360
00:48:23.419 --> 00:48:26.221
I believe very strongly in having a mission statement

1361
00:48:26.221 --> 00:48:29.157
and having your goals and dreams laid out,

1362
00:48:29.157 --> 00:48:30.892
and also to every single day,

1363
00:48:30.892 --> 00:48:33.763
to actually type in what blessings you had that day.

1364
00:48:33.763 --> 00:48:35.698
I have literally hundreds of pages of blessings

1365
00:48:35.698 --> 00:48:38.034
that I've kept record of, because if you ever have a moment

1366
00:48:38.034 --> 00:48:39.834
you're not inspired you can always read that

1367
00:48:39.834 --> 00:48:42.103
and remind yourself of the blessings that are in your life.

1368
00:48:42.103 --> 00:48:44.105
So that's a daily ritual, and then,

1369
00:48:44.105 --> 00:48:46.308
if I get it during the day, I may miss it during the day,

1370
00:48:46.308 --> 00:48:47.775
but always at night when I'm transitioning

1371
00:48:47.775 --> 00:48:50.346
from this dream world back into the other dream world,

1372
00:48:50.346 --> 00:48:52.747
which one is real reality, we don't know,

1373
00:48:52.747 --> 00:48:54.148
but what happens is I do that again

1374
00:48:54.148 --> 00:48:56.618
and I try not to go to bed until I have that tear again.

1375
00:48:56.618 --> 00:48:57.854
And what that does, it allows you

1376
00:48:57.854 --> 00:49:00.189
to have a feeling of grace

1377
00:49:00.189 --> 00:49:02.006
in and out of this existence.

1378
00:49:03.291 --> 00:49:04.359
<v ->Thank you very much.</v>

1379
00:49:04.359 --> 00:49:06.711
Your words are an absolute gift.

1380
00:49:07.696 --> 00:49:10.198
I'll be watching this interview a few times myself.

1381
00:49:10.198 --> 00:49:12.902
Now if you found Dr. Demartini interesting

1382
00:49:12.902 --> 00:49:14.602
you will likely enjoy our interview

1383
00:49:14.602 --> 00:49:17.173
with Dr. Vernon Woolf, who has devoted his life

1384
00:49:17.173 --> 00:49:19.041
to helping others connect with their

1385
00:49:19.041 --> 00:49:20.809
deepest inner wisdom,

1386
00:49:20.809 --> 00:49:23.445
which he calls our full potential selves.

1387
00:49:23.445 --> 00:49:25.596
Until next time, thanks for watching.
