00:00:14.771 --> 00:00:17.071
<v ->A rising number of citizens in the United States</v>

2
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:19.531
are becoming concerned about the smart meter devices

3
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:21.732
being installed on the side of their homes.

4
00:00:21.732 --> 00:00:24.571
Often, without their awareness or permission.

5
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:27.710
These meters are now being termed as surveillance devices

6
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.951
omitting sometimes high levels of radiation into our homes.

7
00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:33.091
Jerry Day has not only been informing people

8
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:34.871
as to what these meters are doing,

9
00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:36.891
but how to legally remove them.

10
00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:39.131
He says the process is not for the fainthearted,

11
00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:40.631
nor amateur electrician,

12
00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:42.680
but it can be done.

13
00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:45.651
So Jerry, you've done a beautiful job

14
00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:48.050
documenting our rights as citizens

15
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.690
regarding the smart meter,

16
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.291
and we're gonna show that video in a little bit.

17
00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:52.251
The how-to portion of it.

18
00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:55.011
But, I wanted to have more of a conversation

19
00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:59.891
about the ethics and about what you feel the agenda is.

20
00:00:59.891 --> 00:01:03.151
We'll even get into Agenda 21 starting with,

21
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:06.700
when they walk onto your land when you're away at work,

22
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.001
like they did to us one day and we live in the country.

23
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:09.811
<v ->Right.</v>

24
00:01:11.021 --> 00:01:12.751
<v Regina>And swap out the analog meter</v>

25
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:13.791
for the smart meter.

26
00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:14.420
<v ->Right.</v>

27
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.206
<v Regina>What right do they have to do that?</v>

28
00:01:16.206 --> 00:01:17.106
<v ->Oh, Absolutely none.</v>

29
00:01:17.106 --> 00:01:20.136
They're installing a surveillance device on your property.

30
00:01:20.136 --> 00:01:21.656
There's a federal wire-tapping law,

31
00:01:21.656 --> 00:01:24.334
I think it's Title 18,

32
00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:27.654
Chapter 19, Section 2511, I believe.

33
00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:30.355
And it says, "If you use an electronic device

34
00:01:30.355 --> 00:01:32.894
"in any communications to spy on people,

35
00:01:32.894 --> 00:01:34.464
"you are violating that."

36
00:01:34.464 --> 00:01:36.274
And that's a five year prison sentence.

37
00:01:36.274 --> 00:01:38.474
So that's what your power company is doing

38
00:01:38.474 --> 00:01:41.234
right from the beginning. (clears throat)

39
00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:45.354
The reason it's wire tapping is because

40
00:01:45.354 --> 00:01:48.594
they're collecting data about your energy usage

41
00:01:48.594 --> 00:01:50.434
down to the flip of a switch.

42
00:01:50.434 --> 00:01:52.894
So this is not like a monthly meter.

43
00:01:52.894 --> 00:01:54.984
This is spying on your home where,

44
00:01:54.984 --> 00:01:57.074
every time you turn on or off something,

45
00:01:58.054 --> 00:02:00.714
they can now, and they will be able to more in the future,

46
00:02:00.714 --> 00:02:04.694
identify the appliance or device you turn on and off.

47
00:02:04.694 --> 00:02:06.834
So you can imagine there's some appliances

48
00:02:06.834 --> 00:02:09.474
that have to do with more private matters,

49
00:02:09.474 --> 00:02:12.254
and they can tell things about your sex life,

50
00:02:12.254 --> 00:02:14.295
they can tell things about your medical conditions,

51
00:02:14.295 --> 00:02:15.954
they can tell all kinds of things.

52
00:02:15.954 --> 00:02:19.214
Because this data is recorded event by event,

53
00:02:19.214 --> 00:02:20.835
put into a data set,

54
00:02:20.835 --> 00:02:22.954
and made accessible to the power company

55
00:02:22.954 --> 00:02:25.354
on their computers forever.

56
00:02:25.354 --> 00:02:28.834
So it'll be accessible to law enforcement,

57
00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:30.494
it'll be accessible to hackers.

58
00:02:30.494 --> 00:02:32.654
Now this is moment to moment, day to day,

59
00:02:32.654 --> 00:02:35.134
your activities inside your home.

60
00:02:35.134 --> 00:02:38.054
This is your personal life inside your home.

61
00:02:38.054 --> 00:02:40.264
So how in the world they even imagine

62
00:02:40.264 --> 00:02:43.074
that they could get away with this,

63
00:02:43.074 --> 00:02:44.424
what these meters are doing.

64
00:02:45.514 --> 00:02:48.662
It's hard to imagine how they talked themselves into this.

65
00:02:48.662 --> 00:02:50.402
<v Regina>You mentioned in the video,</v>

66
00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:53.142
that the utility companies do have easements.

67
00:02:53.142 --> 00:02:54.982
They have had, traditionally, historically,

68
00:02:54.982 --> 00:02:57.922
have had easement regarding these meters,

69
00:02:57.922 --> 00:03:00.072
but that was not for this meter.

70
00:03:00.072 --> 00:03:00.832
<v ->Of course not.
<v Regina>Can you make the</v>

71
00:03:00.832 --> 00:03:03.003
distinction between the analog and why?

72
00:03:03.003 --> 00:03:04.013
<v ->Yeah.</v>

73
00:03:04.013 --> 00:03:05.512
People may not know what an easement is.

74
00:03:05.512 --> 00:03:07.602
An easement is a right of access.

75
00:03:07.602 --> 00:03:11.682
And that means that, if I come over to your property

76
00:03:11.682 --> 00:03:14.622
once in a while and turn on your hose and take some water,

77
00:03:14.622 --> 00:03:16.762
and you know I'm doing it,

78
00:03:16.762 --> 00:03:19.512
then you've given me an easement to do that.

79
00:03:19.512 --> 00:03:21.402
The other way an easement is created is

80
00:03:21.402 --> 00:03:22.602
you and I have a contract.

81
00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:25.282
I can come over and take some water once in a while.

82
00:03:25.282 --> 00:03:26.503
You define that easement.

83
00:03:26.503 --> 00:03:29.772
So it's either by contract or by implicit contract.

84
00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:35.122
The power company has no contract to spy on you.

85
00:03:35.122 --> 00:03:36.287
<v Regina>But they do have a contract</v>

86
00:03:36.287 --> 00:03:40.066
to record your energy usage, i.e., analog.

87
00:03:40.066 --> 00:03:41.967
<v ->One number a month.</v>

88
00:03:41.967 --> 00:03:43.567
<v Regina>One number a month, right.</v>

89
00:03:43.567 --> 00:03:44.907
<v ->And that's the easement.</v>

90
00:03:44.907 --> 00:03:46.708
And that's probably something,

91
00:03:46.708 --> 00:03:48.507
if there is a contract at all,

92
00:03:48.507 --> 00:03:49.587
that's probably what it says.

93
00:03:49.587 --> 00:03:51.078
Because the contracts would have conceived

94
00:03:51.078 --> 00:03:52.586
many years ago.

95
00:03:52.586 --> 00:03:56.447
So they're gonna say, "We can get your monthly energy usage

96
00:03:56.447 --> 00:03:58.788
"and we can send you a bill for that."

97
00:03:58.788 --> 00:03:59.437
That's their easement.

98
00:03:59.437 --> 00:04:01.998
<v Regina>That's one reading, one snapshot a month?</v>

99
00:04:01.998 --> 00:04:05.528
<v ->Exactly. What they're doing is they're radiating your home</v>

100
00:04:05.528 --> 00:04:08.737
with electromagnetic radiation.

101
00:04:08.737 --> 00:04:10.477
There's no easement for that.

102
00:04:10.477 --> 00:04:13.957
They are not permitted to put a radiation-emitting device

103
00:04:13.957 --> 00:04:15.318
on your property.

104
00:04:15.318 --> 00:04:18.058
And to imagine that they can do that without any consent,

105
00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:18.977
without any knowledge,

106
00:04:18.977 --> 00:04:22.428
without even informing you that they're doing it,

107
00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:23.538
is ridiculous.

108
00:04:23.538 --> 00:04:24.918
So there's two things that they're just

109
00:04:24.918 --> 00:04:26.997
in complete fantasy land about.

110
00:04:26.997 --> 00:04:28.218
That we can spy on people,

111
00:04:28.218 --> 00:04:29.937
and that we can radiate their property.

112
00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:33.997
And this radiation is a class 2B carcinogen

113
00:04:33.997 --> 00:04:36.607
according to the World Health Organization.

114
00:04:36.607 --> 00:04:39.967
It is damaging, harmful radiation.

115
00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:41.917
Your daughter, when she's born,

116
00:04:41.917 --> 00:04:44.637
she has something like 400 eggs.

117
00:04:44.637 --> 00:04:47.737
Those eggs are specifically targeted

118
00:04:47.737 --> 00:04:48.947
by this type of radiation.

119
00:04:48.947 --> 00:04:51.198
It's pulse, weapon-grade radiation,

120
00:04:51.198 --> 00:04:53.668
and you're looking at permanent birth defects.

121
00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:56.487
Not only that affect your daughter's children,

122
00:04:56.487 --> 00:04:58.637
but every generation thereafter.

123
00:04:58.637 --> 00:05:01.257
Those are permanent, irreparable birth defects.

124
00:05:01.257 --> 00:05:03.017
<v Regina>Are you talking about infertility</v>

125
00:05:03.017 --> 00:05:05.028
in addition to birth defects?

126
00:05:05.028 --> 00:05:06.157
<v ->Probably not, probably not.</v>

127
00:05:06.157 --> 00:05:07.297
<v Regina>No, birth defects.</v>

128
00:05:07.297 --> 00:05:08.818
<v ->Birth defects.</v>

129
00:05:08.818 --> 00:05:10.907
<v Regina>And so you're talking about a change in the DNA</v>

130
00:05:10.907 --> 00:05:13.007
that is then passed on through the generations.

131
00:05:13.007 --> 00:05:17.428
<v ->Right. This radiation deconstructs DNA.</v>

132
00:05:17.428 --> 00:05:18.537
That is what it does.

133
00:05:18.537 --> 00:05:19.597
<v Regina>What are some of the cases</v>

134
00:05:19.597 --> 00:05:21.957
of what it has been known to do?

135
00:05:21.957 --> 00:05:23.537
<v ->Well, you'd have to talk to somebody</v>

136
00:05:23.537 --> 00:05:26.858
who researches DNA and birth defects.

137
00:05:26.858 --> 00:05:28.977
When you want to talk about history,

138
00:05:28.977 --> 00:05:31.238
there is very little history on smart meters

139
00:05:31.238 --> 00:05:32.828
because they're a recent thing,

140
00:05:32.828 --> 00:05:34.218
so we don't have the data.

141
00:05:34.218 --> 00:05:35.939
But we do know that the radiation

142
00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:39.047
is not stuff you want to put into little girl's bedrooms.

143
00:05:40.107 --> 00:05:42.027
<v Regina>Is it Switzerland or Austria</v>

144
00:05:42.027 --> 00:05:43.358
that has outlawed this technology?

145
00:05:43.358 --> 00:05:44.897
<v ->I think Switzerland, but I'm not sure.</v>

146
00:05:44.897 --> 00:05:46.958
<v Regina>They've outlawed that technology in their country</v>

147
00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.718
for the exact reason that you're talking about.

148
00:05:48.718 --> 00:05:50.478
<v ->Yeah, well, we're entering an era</v>

149
00:05:50.478 --> 00:05:52.477
in human history, unprecedented.

150
00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:53.897
Where we've just discovered

151
00:05:53.897 --> 00:05:56.218
that we can make everything wireless.

152
00:05:56.218 --> 00:05:57.677
Our phones, our whatever, whatever.

153
00:05:57.677 --> 00:05:59.657
There's a list that goes on for days and you don't realize,

154
00:05:59.657 --> 00:06:01.307
oh, I use that, and I use that too.

155
00:06:01.307 --> 00:06:02.319
Oh, yeah, I use that too.

156
00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.960
All these things around us are turning wireless,

157
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.549
and they're coming up now with cancers

158
00:06:06.549 --> 00:06:11.149
from people who had their laptop on their lap with the wi-fi

159
00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:14.040
and they're going into testicular cancer and all this.

160
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.729
And so, the flood,

161
00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:19.530
the overall bath of wireless technology

162
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.910
is now beyond anything in history.

163
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.970
And we won't know, it's like tobacco.

164
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.449
50, 60 years ago, we didn't know what tobacco

165
00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:28.629
was going to do to us.

166
00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:29.929
And then as it became apparent,

167
00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:32.530
these lung cancer cases became associatable with tobacco

168
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:33.829
we went, okay, now we know.

169
00:06:33.829 --> 00:06:35.510
Now we see. There's hard data.

170
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.980
There's, I smoked, I got lung cancer data.

171
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:39.919
We don't have any idea,

172
00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:41.890
we're still 50 or 60 years out from knowing

173
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.429
what our bath, our electropollution,

174
00:06:44.429 --> 00:06:47.849
electro-toxin pollution bath is going to do to us.

175
00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:49.690
It is going to deconstruct DNA,

176
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.910
it is going to violate cellular integrity.

177
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.849
That's what this radiation does.

178
00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:55.930
We know that.

179
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.710
So we're way ahead of the tobacco curve.

180
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.850
We know that this is damaging,

181
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.800
so there's already concrete liabilities

182
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.029
on these power companies, already.

183
00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:08.050
So you go back to 1940,

184
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.131
there wasn't liability on tobacco companies.

185
00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:11.730
Nobody had the data.

186
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.040
But we're starting this little experiment

187
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.789
with data that says, this is probably very dangerous,

188
00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:18.530
and there will be harm done.

189
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.409
<v Regina>Just to go back to what you were talking about</v>

190
00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:23.249
at the beginning of the conversation,

191
00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:25.729
you were saying that they're able to not only

192
00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:27.900
monitor the usage minute by minute.

193
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.339
It's not a snapshot, it's not a monthly snapshot anymore.

194
00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:32.220
It's surveillance when you can monitor

195
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.480
someone's household minute by minute.

196
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.519
But you said it's not going to be long before

197
00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:39.300
they can actually determine what kind of appliance?

198
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.819
<v ->Oh, yeah. They can do that now.</v>

199
00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:41.999
There's two ways they determine

200
00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:44.059
what appliance you just turned on or off.

201
00:07:44.059 --> 00:07:46.340
Ultimately, it will be with something they call

202
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.899
smart chip appliances,

203
00:07:47.899 --> 00:07:50.420
where the appliance itself will have a fingerprint

204
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.300
that it will transmit to the smart meter

205
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.290
and the smart meter will go,

206
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.000
oh, okay, that's your washing machine.

207
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.530
You turn your washing machine on at three in the afternoon,

208
00:07:58.530 --> 00:07:59.700
that's a peak period,

209
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.059
you now owe us $80 for a penalty.

210
00:08:02.059 --> 00:08:04.740
You had bad energy consumption behavior.

211
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.360
Yeah, and so, they want to do that.

212
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.199
That's what they're going toward.

213
00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:10.320
<v Regina>That's what the agenda is?</v>

214
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.149
<v ->Right, so, within a year, you're going to be seeing</v>

215
00:08:14.149 --> 00:08:15.240
a lot of these chipped,

216
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.779
it'll say in the store, big deal.

217
00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:18.880
Smart appliance, you want the smart one, don't you?

218
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.609
Oh, that's just a chip.

219
00:08:19.609 --> 00:08:21.620
<v Regina>No!</v>
<v ->No, no you don't.</v>

220
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.040
But there's another way that they can tell right away,

221
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.259
right now, what appliances you're using.

222
00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:30.079
And that is, they have a chip I understand,

223
00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:31.660
and I'm not a scientist or researcher,

224
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.610
but this is what I understand from reading

225
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.339
what I can get from these bulletins

226
00:08:35.339 --> 00:08:36.960
that doesn't go over my head.

227
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.659
There is a chip that you can put inline, anywhere,

228
00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:45.820
and if an appliance is turned on, on that circuit,

229
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.959
the chip is designed to recognize that footprint.

230
00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:53.201
So by power current draw footprint, it can identify.

231
00:08:53.201 --> 00:08:54.430
And that creates a data set.

232
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.370
That chip then delivers that information as a data set

233
00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.390
to the power company as part of the metadata

234
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.419
on the smart meter.

235
00:09:02.419 --> 00:09:06.440
<v Regina>So aside from penalizing you</v>

236
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.609
for using certain appliances during peak hours,

237
00:09:09.609 --> 00:09:12.360
what else is done or can be done with that information

238
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.169
that they're gleaning on your consumer usage?

239
00:09:15.169 --> 00:09:18.470
<v ->The idea is to have, apparently,</v>

240
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.059
the most robust data set on human activities,

241
00:09:21.059 --> 00:09:22.839
and human lives, and human identities,

242
00:09:22.839 --> 00:09:23.999
ever in history.

243
00:09:23.999 --> 00:09:25.799
And you've had programs, I'm sure,

244
00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:27.200
where they talked about RFID chips?

245
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.900
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->Okay, so what is that?</v>

246
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.347
Data gathering. It's GPS, it's whatever.

247
00:09:31.347 --> 00:09:32.747
You walk into a store

248
00:09:32.747 --> 00:09:36.377
and your mobile speed pass RFID chip in your wrist

249
00:09:36.377 --> 00:09:39.438
is read by the doormat of the store you walk into,

250
00:09:39.438 --> 00:09:40.587
and we know right where you are.

251
00:09:40.587 --> 00:09:42.427
It's surveillance again.

252
00:09:42.427 --> 00:09:45.137
So we've got GPS on your car now,

253
00:09:45.137 --> 00:09:46.418
we've got GPS in your phone.

254
00:09:46.418 --> 00:09:47.977
We'll have an RFID chip

255
00:09:47.977 --> 00:09:49.977
in your driver's license, in your passport.

256
00:09:49.977 --> 00:09:53.157
Possibly, if you work for the military or something else,

257
00:09:53.157 --> 00:09:54.879
it'll be right in your neck or wherever they put it,

258
00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:57.148
in your arm, elbow, I don't know where they put it.

259
00:09:57.148 --> 00:09:58.040
But... (clears throat)

260
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.364
anywhere there's a cell tower or satellite view,

261
00:10:03.364 --> 00:10:04.744
you can be found.

262
00:10:05.934 --> 00:10:07.385
They literally can type your name

263
00:10:07.385 --> 00:10:09.945
or your social security number into a computer

264
00:10:09.945 --> 00:10:11.185
and not only will you be found

265
00:10:11.185 --> 00:10:13.965
and located instantly, at that moment,

266
00:10:13.965 --> 00:10:16.724
but your entire history will come up.

267
00:10:16.724 --> 00:10:18.164
So all your medical records,

268
00:10:18.164 --> 00:10:19.365
all your criminal records,

269
00:10:19.365 --> 00:10:20.564
your education records,

270
00:10:20.564 --> 00:10:22.585
your credit card transactions,

271
00:10:22.585 --> 00:10:25.585
your home smart meter data.

272
00:10:25.585 --> 00:10:29.745
Can you imagine the resolution of this image,

273
00:10:29.745 --> 00:10:30.905
of your life,

274
00:10:30.905 --> 00:10:35.164
is beyond the capability of your own mind.

275
00:10:35.164 --> 00:10:36.115
<v Regina>Yes, it is.</v>

276
00:10:36.115 --> 00:10:37.664
And there have been some parodies

277
00:10:37.664 --> 00:10:38.964
that have already come out on this.

278
00:10:38.964 --> 00:10:40.884
I don't know if you saw one of them on Youtube,

279
00:10:40.884 --> 00:10:42.275
it's actually very well done.

280
00:10:42.275 --> 00:10:45.195
Where a fella calls up his local pizza place

281
00:10:45.195 --> 00:10:46.535
to order a pizza.

282
00:10:46.535 --> 00:10:47.696
Oh, well, Mr. Taylor.

283
00:10:47.696 --> 00:10:49.164
Well, I see. Are you going to want that

284
00:10:49.164 --> 00:10:51.653
with our garden vegetable toppings--

285
00:10:51.653 --> 00:10:52.764
<v ->Yeah, I see you're on a diet.</v>

286
00:10:52.764 --> 00:10:53.823
<v Regina>I see you're on a diet.</v>

287
00:10:53.823 --> 00:10:54.884
You're 20 pounds overweight

288
00:10:54.884 --> 00:10:56.544
according to your medical records.

289
00:10:56.544 --> 00:10:57.294
And it's really well done.

290
00:10:57.294 --> 00:10:58.383
<v ->And you had donuts this afternoon.</v>

291
00:10:58.383 --> 00:11:00.604
<v Regina>Yeah, exactly.</v>
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>

292
00:11:00.604 --> 00:11:03.533
That's absolutely possible and feasible.

293
00:11:03.533 --> 00:11:04.493
Especially with this kind of data.

294
00:11:04.493 --> 00:11:05.884
<v Regina>Well, I would think, too,</v>

295
00:11:05.884 --> 00:11:07.324
how does this dovetail?

296
00:11:07.324 --> 00:11:08.423
I mean, I don't want to put you on the spot

297
00:11:08.423 --> 00:11:10.023
with things that are really not part of this,

298
00:11:10.023 --> 00:11:12.465
but how does this kind of information then dovetail,

299
00:11:12.465 --> 00:11:15.533
say with, the health care system?

300
00:11:15.533 --> 00:11:17.373
<v ->Well, it's all data collection.</v>

301
00:11:17.373 --> 00:11:19.653
And this business of,

302
00:11:19.653 --> 00:11:22.583
government is where you go for health care,

303
00:11:22.583 --> 00:11:25.333
obviously is tied in with all that.

304
00:11:25.333 --> 00:11:28.481
Government cannot buy infinite health care.

305
00:11:28.481 --> 00:11:29.480
Whatever you want to call it,

306
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.151
there will be some kind of rationing.

307
00:11:31.151 --> 00:11:33.350
There will be some limit on that.

308
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:36.750
How do they know what to do?

309
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.230
Well, they have to have every tiny detail

310
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.031
of your medical condition.

311
00:11:41.031 --> 00:11:44.280
Now when all of your medical and health records

312
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.521
are in their possession,

313
00:11:46.521 --> 00:11:49.310
it's literally unheard of that that wouldn't be hacked,

314
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.370
and abused, and misused, and lost,

315
00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:53.051
and sold, and whatever.

316
00:11:53.051 --> 00:11:53.970
Unheard of.

317
00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.650
There's no such thing as a safe database,

318
00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:56.671
safe digital database.

319
00:11:56.671 --> 00:11:57.831
No such thing at all.

320
00:11:57.831 --> 00:11:58.911
And they say that all the time,

321
00:11:58.911 --> 00:12:00.150
"This is safe, this is secure."

322
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.771
It's an absolute lie.

323
00:12:01.771 --> 00:12:03.641
It's not misleading, it's a lie,

324
00:12:03.641 --> 00:12:04.601
and they know it.

325
00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:05.560
Because government,

326
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.680
you can go to the deepest bowels of the Pentagon,

327
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.570
and they've been violated.

328
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.100
You know, who is it?

329
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.891
Julian Assange's friends get in there

330
00:12:13.891 --> 00:12:15.480
and then put it out.

331
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.821
So that, when we talk about the health care system,

332
00:12:20.821 --> 00:12:24.261
that's obviously a keen interest of government

333
00:12:24.261 --> 00:12:26.831
to say, "My God! We'll just run out of money."

334
00:12:26.831 --> 00:12:28.882
Look what happened with Medicare, it just balloons.

335
00:12:28.882 --> 00:12:30.841
As soon as people have something to tap into

336
00:12:30.841 --> 00:12:32.320
for some free healthcare,

337
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:37.430
in five years it's 10 times what we intended it to be.

338
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:39.910
So they have to have severe, serious,

339
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.120
major invasion in your live to say,

340
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.240
"Oh, you have bad behavior.

341
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.870
"We have an excuse now

342
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.800
"to not give you this diabetic treatment."

343
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.961
Or not give you this whatever

344
00:12:48.961 --> 00:12:51.731
because you eat too much sugar, or whatever.

345
00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:54.530
So the data becomes the power.

346
00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:58.021
That's how they exercise control over their budgets.

347
00:12:58.021 --> 00:13:00.621
That's how they control exercise over your behavior.

348
00:13:00.621 --> 00:13:03.361
If they don't know how you're behaving,

349
00:13:03.361 --> 00:13:04.341
they can't control it.

350
00:13:04.341 --> 00:13:05.980
<v Regina>And so, essentially, you're saying that</v>

351
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.330
the smart meter is almost like an RFID chip for your home.

352
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.969
<v ->That's exactly right, yeah.</v>

353
00:13:13.299 --> 00:13:15.504
<v Regina>Now, my understanding is that,</v>

354
00:13:15.504 --> 00:13:20.254
there are hubs of sorts where you'll have a smart meter

355
00:13:20.254 --> 00:13:21.705
master meter on one home,

356
00:13:21.705 --> 00:13:23.664
and then surrounding meters that are then

357
00:13:23.664 --> 00:13:25.525
feeding back and communicating with it.

358
00:13:25.525 --> 00:13:29.365
Can you talk about the nature of that matrix of these hubs?

359
00:13:29.365 --> 00:13:30.885
<v ->There does have to be hubs</v>

360
00:13:30.885 --> 00:13:34.344
because your meter can't always reach.

361
00:13:34.344 --> 00:13:35.435
Sometimes they have these hubs

362
00:13:35.435 --> 00:13:37.685
on light poles or around the town.

363
00:13:37.685 --> 00:13:39.895
It can't always reach those.

364
00:13:39.895 --> 00:13:43.695
So they have a master meter that's much bigger,

365
00:13:43.695 --> 00:13:45.664
and puts out much more wattage,

366
00:13:45.664 --> 00:13:48.745
and is much more dangerous in terms of radiation emission,

367
00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:51.355
even than the regular smart meters.

368
00:13:51.355 --> 00:13:53.785
And they do put those on certain houses

369
00:13:53.785 --> 00:13:54.965
where they need to relay.

370
00:13:54.965 --> 00:13:57.084
And the meters are incredible technology.

371
00:13:57.084 --> 00:13:58.625
They relay from house to house,

372
00:13:58.625 --> 00:14:01.484
so all of my data stays as a data set,

373
00:14:01.484 --> 00:14:03.584
as a recognizable, identified data set,

374
00:14:03.584 --> 00:14:05.124
and goes bouncing from my neighbor's house

375
00:14:05.124 --> 00:14:06.094
to my neighbor's house.

376
00:14:06.094 --> 00:14:08.514
So anybody along there could hack it, for one thing.

377
00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:11.905
And then, my neighbor, who happens to be the unlucky one

378
00:14:11.905 --> 00:14:14.535
to be near or at the master meter,

379
00:14:14.535 --> 00:14:16.545
is getting 10 times the radiation

380
00:14:16.545 --> 00:14:18.844
because they have to endure my data

381
00:14:18.844 --> 00:14:20.874
going through their home.

382
00:14:20.874 --> 00:14:22.925
<v Regina>Now does the utility company tell them</v>

383
00:14:22.925 --> 00:14:25.874
that they are hosting this unit?

384
00:14:25.874 --> 00:14:27.046
<v ->I have no idea.</v>

385
00:14:27.046 --> 00:14:28.865
I've never heard that a utility company

386
00:14:28.865 --> 00:14:31.905
has disclosed hardly anything about smart meters.

387
00:14:31.905 --> 00:14:36.905
All I know is the flyer that I got from my electric company

388
00:14:36.915 --> 00:14:39.245
and what they said was, "This is gonna be great

389
00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:41.615
"because this will let us know how and when

390
00:14:41.615 --> 00:14:43.484
"you use electricity."

391
00:14:43.484 --> 00:14:44.324
<v Regina>Right.</v>

392
00:14:44.954 --> 00:14:45.884
<v ->That's a quote from their flyer.</v>

393
00:14:45.884 --> 00:14:48.145
<v Regina>Right, how and when. Yeah.</v>

394
00:14:48.145 --> 00:14:49.724
<v ->Excuse me, where did you get the presumption</v>

395
00:14:49.724 --> 00:14:52.645
you were entitled to know how and when I use electricity?

396
00:14:52.645 --> 00:14:55.344
How and when means that appliance event.

397
00:14:55.344 --> 00:14:56.904
That means, flipping a switch.

398
00:14:56.904 --> 00:14:58.307
That means, not monthly.

399
00:14:58.307 --> 00:14:59.365
How and when.

400
00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:01.525
So they're admitting that this is invasive.

401
00:15:01.525 --> 00:15:04.765
They're admitting that they're conducting surveillance.

402
00:15:04.765 --> 00:15:07.364
I don't understand how they're getting away with it.

403
00:15:07.364 --> 00:15:09.525
<v Regina>Now, what about the practical,</v>

404
00:15:09.525 --> 00:15:13.425
and also the actual meter readings?

405
00:15:15.225 --> 00:15:17.662
I'm just throwing this out there.

406
00:15:17.662 --> 00:15:19.422
When they slapped one on our house,

407
00:15:19.422 --> 00:15:21.642
which we haven't taken off yet, by the way.

408
00:15:21.642 --> 00:15:22.701
<v ->Whoo! Get rid of that.</v>

409
00:15:22.701 --> 00:15:23.582
<v Regina>I'm glad we've met you so we can figure out</v>

410
00:15:23.582 --> 00:15:24.812
how to go through this process.

411
00:15:24.812 --> 00:15:26.832
But when they slapped it on,

412
00:15:26.832 --> 00:15:30.142
it just seemed like there was a spike in our bills.

413
00:15:30.142 --> 00:15:31.922
Now have you heard this from other people?

414
00:15:31.922 --> 00:15:33.572
<v ->Yeah, oh yeah.</v>

415
00:15:33.572 --> 00:15:34.792
<v Regina>Tell us what you know about this.</v>

416
00:15:34.792 --> 00:15:36.772
<v ->Well, that goes several different ways.</v>

417
00:15:36.772 --> 00:15:38.872
PG&amp;E is probably the stupidest

418
00:15:38.872 --> 00:15:41.102
electric company on the planet.

419
00:15:41.102 --> 00:15:46.102
They claim that they timed their smart meter introduction

420
00:15:46.852 --> 00:15:51.190
at the same time as rates would happen to go up

421
00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:53.180
for summer consumption or some other deal.

422
00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.509
They said, "Oh, yes. The bills did go up.

423
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:56.950
"We can't lie about that.

424
00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.010
"Your bill is higher this month than it was last month.

425
00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:00.790
"We did install a smart meter this month,

426
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.490
"but it wasn't because of the smart meter.

427
00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.960
"It was because of this accident that happened

428
00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.230
"when we installed the smart meter at a time

429
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:08.710
"when your bill would have gone up more anyway."

430
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:10.349
<v Regina>Yeah, but we took that into consideration</v>

431
00:16:10.349 --> 00:16:11.390
looking over the bills.

432
00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:13.560
<v ->It's a complete lie.
<v Regina>That doesn't wash.</v>

433
00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.470
<v Jerry>So PG&amp;E is not only stupid enough</v>

434
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.811
to jack up your rate when you get the smart meter,

435
00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:20.330
but they're stupid enough to lie about it.

436
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.340
I mean, the criminal aspect gets so broad

437
00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.869
that you just go...

438
00:16:24.869 --> 00:16:29.049
It becomes like the bank disaster.

439
00:16:29.049 --> 00:16:31.290
It's like, why aren't these people in prison?

440
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.529
Apparently, there's no rule of law

441
00:16:34.529 --> 00:16:36.180
in this country anymore.

442
00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.069
So, what I was gonna say,

443
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:40.860
there's two different ways to look at this

444
00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.200
price spike thing.

445
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.719
They can charge you whatever they want for your electricity,

446
00:16:45.719 --> 00:16:47.350
regardless of whether you have a smart meter.

447
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:48.670
They just decide what to charge you.

448
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:53.500
So the smart meter itself doesn't cause your bill to go up.

449
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.649
The data allows them to penalize you

450
00:16:56.649 --> 00:16:59.230
for certain behaviors that they didn't know about before.

451
00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.460
"Oh, you're a bad little energy consumption person."

452
00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.670
<v Regina>But are they already doing that?</v>

453
00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.429
Is that already being reflected?

454
00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:04.900
<v ->Oh yeah.</v>

455
00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.119
<v Regina>And we just don't know it?</v>

456
00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:07.869
<v ->Well, let's go back.</v>

457
00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:10.850
That goes back to the identification appliance usage.

458
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:13.299
There are certain appliances

459
00:17:13.299 --> 00:17:14.640
that are considered to be elective.

460
00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.309
So you're supposed to do your laundry

461
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:17.839
at two in the morning now.

462
00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:18.850
<v Regina>Oh, come on.</v>

463
00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:21.429
<v ->That's good energy behavior.</v>

464
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:23.590
So if you do your laundry in the afternoon,

465
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:25.909
when Grandma needs the air conditioner,

466
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:28.509
then you're a bad, bad person.

467
00:17:28.509 --> 00:17:32.909
And you are susceptible to any kind of penalty for that.

468
00:17:32.909 --> 00:17:35.340
<v Regina>Has this been implemented already?</v>

469
00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.609
<v ->Well, what I was gonna say is,</v>

470
00:17:36.609 --> 00:17:38.509
they have to get the resolution.

471
00:17:38.509 --> 00:17:41.879
Right now, they're sort of tweaking all the dials.

472
00:17:41.879 --> 00:17:44.650
They've got the smart meter mesh in,

473
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:48.380
in our town, Burbank, it's 99.8% installed.

474
00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:49.530
So right now they're going, "Okay,

475
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:51.150
"we're essentially all there

476
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:54.770
"and we're gonna tweak it and set up our metrics,

477
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:57.490
"so that we can resolve this data."

478
00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:01.399
You've gotta remember, the amount of data going in...

479
00:18:01.399 --> 00:18:04.570
This thing is pinging you every three seconds.

480
00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:06.300
So they talk about,

481
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.449
"Oh, it only works 45 seconds a day,

482
00:18:08.449 --> 00:18:10.409
or a minute and a half a day."

483
00:18:10.409 --> 00:18:11.150
They'll tell you that.

484
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.010
That's a big lie they love to tell.

485
00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.350
"It's only working three minutes a day."

486
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.290
Okay, so you figure,

487
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.910
"Okay, if I can just not be at home for that three minutes."

488
00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:20.590
Well, here's what you'd have to do.

489
00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:23.260
You'd have to leave the house for two nanoseconds,

490
00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.939
every three seconds.

491
00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:27.910
2,000ths of a second,

492
00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:29.630
that thing sends out pulsed energy

493
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.249
and it waits for three seconds,

494
00:18:31.249 --> 00:18:32.270
and does it again.

495
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:34.750
And that's only if it's on cruise control.

496
00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.760
If it's on, "I've gotta relay my neighbor's energy data,"

497
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.670
or something else.

498
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.569
Or, "They've shielded their meter

499
00:18:40.569 --> 00:18:43.330
"and now I have to try harder to get this data out,"

500
00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:44.290
it's going crazy.

501
00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.509
It's just flooding your property

502
00:18:45.509 --> 00:18:47.470
with electromagnetic radiation.

503
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:49.759
But if it's just on cruise control,

504
00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:53.019
it's doing a weapon's grade pulse EMF emission

505
00:18:53.019 --> 00:18:54.920
every three seconds,

506
00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.600
for 2,000ths of a second.

507
00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.270
Now this is the same kind of energy

508
00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:03.669
that you use in the military to disable your opponent,

509
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:06.530
so this is not kid's play.

510
00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:10.050
But, because it's 2,000ths of a second long,

511
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.570
they add it all up and say,

512
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:13.630
"Oh, that only comes to three minutes a day.

513
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.510
"We'll tell them we're only radiating them

514
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:16.769
"three minutes a day.

515
00:19:16.769 --> 00:19:18.320
"What does that have to do with anything?"

516
00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.989
<v Regina>Right.</v>
<v ->It's a deliberate lie.</v>

517
00:19:19.989 --> 00:19:23.140
Anyone who tells you, "Oh, it's only three minutes a day,"

518
00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.410
can't possibly be ignorant of what they're saying.

519
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:26.489
They know that they're lying.

520
00:19:26.489 --> 00:19:28.910
They know they're misrepresenting.

521
00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:32.299
Our power company in Burbank,

522
00:19:32.299 --> 00:19:34.610
the Chairman of the Board, Ron Davis,

523
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.830
said exactly that at the City Council meeting.

524
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:39.091
"It only goes three minutes a day."

525
00:19:39.091 --> 00:19:40.110
Blatant liar.

526
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:41.040
<v Regina>Did you get up and challenge him?</v>

527
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.919
<v ->I spoke out during his time.</v>

528
00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:47.950
From the peanut gallery I said, "That is not true."

529
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.629
And everybody should do that

530
00:19:49.629 --> 00:19:51.139
because these people will say this

531
00:19:51.139 --> 00:19:53.529
until they're not permitted to get away with it.

532
00:19:57.289 --> 00:19:58.390
I think I got off point.

533
00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.779
There's these two ways of identifying this stuff and one is,

534
00:20:02.779 --> 00:20:06.149
in this general power draw footprint

535
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:08.269
and that they can do now.

536
00:20:08.269 --> 00:20:11.320
But, getting back to the point of,

537
00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.270
"When will they penalize me for turning on

538
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.499
my air conditioner at the wrong time of day?"

539
00:20:16.499 --> 00:20:20.730
I think they have to get better at parsing this data.

540
00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.860
I think that the software programs and everybody

541
00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.590
are having to deal with a massive mountain of data

542
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:29.050
coming in constantly.

543
00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:31.849
It's not just a mountain, it's a stream of mountains.

544
00:20:31.849 --> 00:20:34.649
Everybody's smart meter pinging every three seconds,

545
00:20:34.649 --> 00:20:37.210
all day, all over town, by the millions.

546
00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:39.049
And this smart meter data

547
00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:42.459
has a whole gang of data per pulse.

548
00:20:42.459 --> 00:20:46.710
So the data set is almost impossible to imagine

549
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:50.810
and conceive how much data they have to collect and control.

550
00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.749
So my experience of computers is,

551
00:20:55.749 --> 00:20:59.521
for the first five years they don't get it right at all.

552
00:20:59.521 --> 00:21:02.330
Imagine when you had the first Microsoft product,

553
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:04.330
if you've been around that long.

554
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.549
It was years before that thing would not be buggy,

555
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:10.020
and not crash you, and this and that.

556
00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.110
And they weren't having to deal with anywhere near

557
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.830
the kind of data processing challenge

558
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.159
that this smart meter thing will be.

559
00:21:16.159 --> 00:21:18.670
So you're gonna have years of problems.

560
00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.849
And PG&amp;E has had these problems,

561
00:21:20.849 --> 00:21:22.399
where people are getting crazy bills.

562
00:21:22.399 --> 00:21:23.510
Like five times as much.

563
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:24.990
<v Regina>Yes, exactly.</v>

564
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.510
<v ->And it's just because that's how data works.</v>

565
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:29.449
It's hard to manage, and hard to control,

566
00:21:29.449 --> 00:21:30.790
and hard to figure out.

567
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.950
<v Regina>So it's not our imagination?</v>

568
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.530
We're getting skewed data.

569
00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.922
<v ->Oh yeah. It would be an absolute miracle,</v>

570
00:21:35.922 --> 00:21:37.209
unprecedented in history,

571
00:21:37.209 --> 00:21:38.649
if they could take all this data

572
00:21:38.649 --> 00:21:42.210
and have it perfectly generate accurate bills every time.

573
00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:43.471
<v Regina>Well, in just what you're talking about,</v>

574
00:21:43.471 --> 00:21:45.870
relaying from one house to the next.

575
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.550
It seems like that,

576
00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:49.561
I'm not an electrician, obviously,

577
00:21:49.561 --> 00:21:52.690
but it seems like that's right for corrosion or corruption

578
00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:53.870
somewhere along the way,

579
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:55.670
in terms of the signals and the readings.

580
00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:57.720
<v ->That's probably one of the lesser of their problems.</v>

581
00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:58.820
<v Regina>Really?</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

582
00:22:02.199 --> 00:22:05.228
You can packetize data,

583
00:22:05.228 --> 00:22:07.159
and computers are pretty good at saying,

584
00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:09.798
"Oh, this is 0915633.

585
00:22:09.798 --> 00:22:12.798
I'll put it all with the 0915633 stack."

586
00:22:12.798 --> 00:22:14.519
Computers are good at that type of thing.

587
00:22:14.519 --> 00:22:15.320
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

588
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.870
<v ->Not to say there can't be errors</v>

589
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.770
because any time you have wireless transmission,

590
00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:22.449
obviously, something can interrupt that.

591
00:22:22.449 --> 00:22:25.129
<v Regina>It's got to be subject to something, yeah.</v>

592
00:22:27.019 --> 00:22:31.580
<v ->But the place to expect your problems initially,</v>

593
00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:35.460
is these few clerks that work at the power company

594
00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.711
who are used to one reading per month,

595
00:22:38.711 --> 00:22:42.000
send out a bill, and get a payment.

596
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.301
They have turned into the deepest basement at the Pentagon.

597
00:22:46.301 --> 00:22:48.721
They've turned into the NSA.

598
00:22:48.721 --> 00:22:50.581
They've turned into the CIA.

599
00:22:50.581 --> 00:22:52.710
They have to deal with data sets

600
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.900
like they have never imagined.

601
00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.640
There's no way they could be prepared for this,

602
00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.820
so it'll be years before they quite have it all

603
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.780
nailed down to where every little nuance

604
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.800
of your smart meter data is reflected

605
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.120
accurately and correctly on your bill.

606
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.121
What they're doing now, is estimating.

607
00:23:09.121 --> 00:23:12.021
I had somebody in here, this is a video studio,

608
00:23:12.021 --> 00:23:14.420
every once in a while we'd flip on all the video lights,

609
00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.370
and that shows up on my electric bill.

610
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:19.250
It doesn't show up

611
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.741
because right now they're not using real data.

612
00:23:21.741 --> 00:23:23.181
They're guessing.

613
00:23:23.181 --> 00:23:23.920
<v Regina>I see.</v>

614
00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.751
<v ->Now I don't have a smart meter,</v>

615
00:23:24.751 --> 00:23:25.901
I still have the analog meter.

616
00:23:25.901 --> 00:23:27.901
They shouldn't have any problem here.

617
00:23:27.901 --> 00:23:29.961
But that shows you what kind of trouble they're in.

618
00:23:29.961 --> 00:23:32.360
'Cause they having to relay house to house...

619
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.240
my house ain't relaying.

620
00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.200
And so, there's some data they're missing.

621
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.071
And my neighbor next door said he's been getting estimates.

622
00:23:39.071 --> 00:23:42.700
He said he went on a vacation for two weeks

623
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.061
and shut everything down,

624
00:23:44.061 --> 00:23:46.320
and his power bill did not change more than a dollar.

625
00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.161
<v Regina>Right. We had the same experience.</v>

626
00:23:48.161 --> 00:23:49.600
<v ->So they're just winging it.</v>

627
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.401
And that's what they're gonna be doing,

628
00:23:51.401 --> 00:23:52.940
maybe for years.

629
00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.100
They're gonna be pretending,

630
00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.691
like they've got this thing wired.

631
00:23:55.691 --> 00:23:57.000
<v Regina>But don't they also cover that under,</v>

632
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.661
I think they call it, energy averaging?

633
00:23:59.661 --> 00:24:00.520
So you have a choice.

634
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.440
You can have it averaged,

635
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.651
and so I know with some people--

636
00:24:02.651 --> 00:24:04.361
<v ->That probably is different.</v>

637
00:24:04.361 --> 00:24:05.581
<v Regina>Yeah, that is.</v>

638
00:24:05.581 --> 00:24:08.421
<v ->Energy averaging is energy guessing,</v>

639
00:24:08.421 --> 00:24:10.140
but there's also energy guessing.

640
00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.030
Which is like, "We have no idea

641
00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:14.130
"what these people are really using,

642
00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:16.580
"and we don't know how to parse this data yet,

643
00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:17.740
"and so we'll just...

644
00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.580
"Luckily, we're still close enough to the time in history

645
00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.200
"when we were getting analog bills

646
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.010
"and we have a rough idea what this family was paying,

647
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:27.681
"so we'll just shift that a few bucks each month

648
00:24:27.681 --> 00:24:30.310
"and send that to them until we have this whole

649
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.320
"data computer thing figured out."

650
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:35.340
I wouldn't want to be in their shoes

651
00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.600
because that could be years,

652
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.940
and you can only guess for so long.

653
00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.120
You've got people selling houses,

654
00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.841
moving out, tenants, whatever.

655
00:24:43.041 --> 00:24:44.211
<v Regina>You have to have hard data sooner or later.</v>

656
00:24:44.211 --> 00:24:45.620
<v ->Yeah, this data's gonna be crazy.</v>

657
00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:49.591
<v Regina>Well now I've heard that PG&amp;E,</v>

658
00:24:49.591 --> 00:24:51.012
here in California,

659
00:24:51.012 --> 00:24:55.233
have actually been quietly going around

660
00:24:55.233 --> 00:24:58.692
at the request of some of the customers like yourself,

661
00:24:58.692 --> 00:25:00.873
and soon to be us, and removing them.

662
00:25:00.873 --> 00:25:02.212
That they're not making a deal out of it,

663
00:25:02.212 --> 00:25:04.113
they're not letting anyone know this is an option,

664
00:25:04.113 --> 00:25:07.514
but that they have been removing some of them.

665
00:25:07.514 --> 00:25:09.152
<v ->They're crazy if they don't.</v>

666
00:25:09.152 --> 00:25:11.853
I can't imagine how they're gonna stay out of court.

667
00:25:11.853 --> 00:25:13.612
<v Regina>Well now, let's talk about that part,</v>

668
00:25:13.612 --> 00:25:14.852
the legal portion of it.

669
00:25:15.812 --> 00:25:17.973
I'm not gonna have you talk about the whole how-to thing

670
00:25:17.973 --> 00:25:19.852
because we're going to put that video up.

671
00:25:19.852 --> 00:25:21.292
You've already done it so well,

672
00:25:21.292 --> 00:25:23.212
it can really assist people through the process.

673
00:25:23.212 --> 00:25:25.132
But just leading into that,

674
00:25:25.132 --> 00:25:28.002
what are the legal rights of the person

675
00:25:28.762 --> 00:25:29.643
versus the utility company?

676
00:25:29.643 --> 00:25:31.202
<v ->Okay, I'm not a lawyer.</v>

677
00:25:31.202 --> 00:25:33.154
I can give you my opinion.
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

678
00:25:33.154 --> 00:25:34.972
<v Jerry>My legal rights are not to</v>

679
00:25:34.972 --> 00:25:36.613
have surveillance conducted on me,

680
00:25:36.613 --> 00:25:38.652
especially in my private home.

681
00:25:38.652 --> 00:25:40.333
There's no way anybody can say that

682
00:25:41.763 --> 00:25:44.408
you have no expectation of privacy in your own home.

683
00:25:44.408 --> 00:25:46.446
If you don't have an expectation of privacy there,

684
00:25:46.446 --> 00:25:48.676
where do you have one? Okay?

685
00:25:48.676 --> 00:25:53.169
So, privacy means nobody's monitoring your activities.

686
00:25:53.979 --> 00:25:56.861
Smart meters are designed for the purpose of

687
00:25:56.861 --> 00:25:59.189
monitoring your activities.

688
00:25:59.189 --> 00:26:00.939
<v Regina>Okay. So right there, number one.</v>

689
00:26:00.939 --> 00:26:02.799
<v ->My big problem is the surveillance.</v>

690
00:26:02.799 --> 00:26:05.139
Now other people have this problem

691
00:26:05.139 --> 00:26:08.339
about electromagnetic sensitivity,

692
00:26:08.339 --> 00:26:11.689
and the DNA issue we talked about earlier.

693
00:26:11.689 --> 00:26:13.579
This is destructive to DNA.

694
00:26:13.579 --> 00:26:16.220
Now, there are technicians who will argue

695
00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:20.780
how far from that transmission source you can be,

696
00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:21.939
and be safe.

697
00:26:21.939 --> 00:26:24.949
Some say right up close, some say three feet,

698
00:26:24.949 --> 00:26:26.939
some say nowhere in the house.

699
00:26:26.939 --> 00:26:29.600
So everybody's disagreeing on that.

700
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.979
We've got to get agreement on that,

701
00:26:30.979 --> 00:26:32.441
scientific agreement, proof,

702
00:26:32.441 --> 00:26:35.660
absolute proof on that.

703
00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:38.489
That may not even be possible,

704
00:26:38.489 --> 00:26:42.109
but there's something like,

705
00:26:42.109 --> 00:26:45.779
between 5% and 13% of the population are EMF sensitive.

706
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:48.959
There's a scientific name for it called

707
00:26:48.959 --> 00:26:51.279
"sensitive receptors."

708
00:26:51.279 --> 00:26:53.660
I have a friend who's had some operations,

709
00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:55.199
she's had some metal put in her head.

710
00:26:56.349 --> 00:26:57.719
If you're around microwaves

711
00:26:57.719 --> 00:26:59.879
and you've got metal in your body,

712
00:26:59.879 --> 00:27:01.299
that metal turns hot.

713
00:27:01.299 --> 00:27:02.569
<v Regina>What about pacemakers and all?</v>

714
00:27:02.569 --> 00:27:05.380
<v ->Yeah, all that. Even worse.</v>

715
00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:09.249
Anything that's using some sort of pulse energy

716
00:27:09.249 --> 00:27:10.160
to do anything in your body.

717
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.219
Any electronic device at all in your body.

718
00:27:12.219 --> 00:27:14.949
So yeah, any implant, any pacemaker,

719
00:27:14.949 --> 00:27:16.280
there's a whole bunch of different kinds.

720
00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.299
They even have them now for dosages

721
00:27:18.299 --> 00:27:20.040
for medications and things.

722
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.949
<v Regina>So that's up to 15% of the population?</v>

723
00:27:21.949 --> 00:27:25.199
<v ->Well, no, no.
<v Regina>The sensitive ones.</v>

724
00:27:25.199 --> 00:27:26.750
<v Jerry>The 5% to 15%,</v>

725
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:29.339
it may have nothing to do with a device.

726
00:27:29.339 --> 00:27:31.040
<v Regina>Right. They're just electrosensitive.</v>

727
00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.459
<v ->Yeah, there are people who get clinical symptoms.</v>

728
00:27:33.459 --> 00:27:36.259
They can't sleep, they lose attention span,

729
00:27:36.259 --> 00:27:39.020
they get headaches, they get fatigue,

730
00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.009
sometimes nausea.

731
00:27:41.009 --> 00:27:42.920
And these are clinical recordable symptoms.

732
00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.359
I spoke to somebody on the phone who said

733
00:27:44.359 --> 00:27:48.270
her hands swelled up when they put the smart meter in.

734
00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:49.249
There was something to do

735
00:27:49.249 --> 00:27:51.579
with her particular medical condition

736
00:27:51.579 --> 00:27:52.979
where she was susceptible to swelling.

737
00:27:52.979 --> 00:27:55.440
And she could say, "When I'm at home,

738
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.300
"I'm near the smart meter, they swell up.

739
00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.140
"When I go away, they go down."

740
00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.919
So she's got, in her view, science.

741
00:28:05.529 --> 00:28:08.920
The electromagnetic sensitive people

742
00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.860
are susceptible no matter what.

743
00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:16.860
And they don't have to be told they are, sometimes.

744
00:28:18.009 --> 00:28:20.220
Most people who find out that they have a problem

745
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:23.110
from their smart meter, figure it out on their own.

746
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:24.190
So the first thing that happens is,

747
00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:25.270
they install the smart meter,

748
00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:26.920
they think nothing of it.

749
00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.599
And then, within that month,

750
00:28:28.599 --> 00:28:30.919
they're starting to get sick.

751
00:28:30.919 --> 00:28:32.299
Then, within that next month,

752
00:28:32.299 --> 00:28:34.169
they're talking to their doctor, they're going around.

753
00:28:34.169 --> 00:28:35.800
And then in about the third month they go,

754
00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.120
"Wait a minute.

755
00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.640
"That started right when they put that smart meter in."

756
00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.149
And they say, "When I sleep in my own bed I get sick,

757
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:44.100
"and I can't sleep, and I get headaches.

758
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.100
"And when I go out to my friend's house,

759
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.600
"or my mother's house, or whatever,

760
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.420
"and sleep there, I'm fine."

761
00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.519
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

762
00:28:50.519 --> 00:28:52.419
<v ->And it started right when that smart meter.</v>

763
00:28:52.419 --> 00:28:54.500
So they have this process and,

764
00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.719
over and over and over again, they find that.

765
00:28:56.719 --> 00:28:59.970
And I have friends, now,

766
00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:01.080
not sleeping in their own beds,

767
00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.200
not staying at their homes.

768
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.999
They're sleeping in their cars,

769
00:29:03.999 --> 00:29:05.459
and there's a number of these.

770
00:29:05.459 --> 00:29:07.180
There's been some news reports about this

771
00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.690
because it's like, you have a perfectly good home.

772
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:11.239
Why are you sleeping in your car?

773
00:29:11.239 --> 00:29:15.029
And they go, some of the first-hand accounts,

774
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:17.759
"I will take my car and I will drive to a park.

775
00:29:17.759 --> 00:29:20.140
"I will drive somewhere until I can physically feel

776
00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:21.819
"that I'm outside of a lot of this."

777
00:29:21.819 --> 00:29:24.600
'Cause sometimes, if they pull up to a park

778
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.740
and there happens to be a cell tower right there,

779
00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.760
they're getting symptoms.

780
00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.059
<v Regina>Well, I'm wondering about babies.</v>

781
00:29:31.059 --> 00:29:32.960
Babies coming in.

782
00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.780
We don't know because they can't express

783
00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:35.819
what they're going through.

784
00:29:35.819 --> 00:29:38.799
We don't know what it's doing to those who can't articulate

785
00:29:38.799 --> 00:29:40.340
the feelings going on.

786
00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.020
<v ->Right. They would have symptoms just like that.</v>

787
00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:47.680
And there's also really terrible skin rashes

788
00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.081
that come up from it.

789
00:29:49.081 --> 00:29:51.320
That, I've read about, is more common with some

790
00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.421
EMFs coming from laptops and stuff.

791
00:29:53.421 --> 00:29:56.620
But people discover that is electromagnetic energy

792
00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.720
that damages skin.

793
00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.800
And it's the same stuff that's

794
00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.349
coming out of your smart meter.

795
00:30:03.349 --> 00:30:04.560
<v Regina>Well, that would be a question</v>

796
00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.639
with some people listening right now which is,

797
00:30:06.639 --> 00:30:08.340
"Hey, we're sitting in front of our computers,

798
00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.561
"we're talking on our cell phones,

799
00:30:09.561 --> 00:30:11.189
"we've got our wireless phones

800
00:30:11.189 --> 00:30:13.360
"and phone stations throughout the house,

801
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.430
"so why are we whining about smart meters

802
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:18.121
"and their emanations?"

803
00:30:18.121 --> 00:30:21.119
<v ->Well, because it's just more on the poison stack.</v>

804
00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:24.779
You know, how much arsenic is okay to take? None.

805
00:30:24.779 --> 00:30:26.040
How much radiation?

806
00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.580
They say that about nuclear radiation.

807
00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:31.449
How much is okay? They said, "None."

808
00:30:31.449 --> 00:30:32.859
There's no safe amount,

809
00:30:32.859 --> 00:30:34.800
there's no amount that won't damage you.

810
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:37.741
<v Regina>Is there a distinctive difference</v>

811
00:30:37.741 --> 00:30:39.549
when you have this pulsing out at you,

812
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:41.060
as opposed to the wireless technology

813
00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:41.839
in a phone or cell phone?

814
00:30:41.839 --> 00:30:44.960
<v ->It's called energy density and when it's pulsed,</v>

815
00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.659
it's high energy density.

816
00:30:46.659 --> 00:30:48.449
And that density, it's just like

817
00:30:48.449 --> 00:30:52.830
if I hold a baseball bat against your forehead,

818
00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:55.280
or I pull it back and I hit your forehead.

819
00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.899
There's quite a difference in the effect on your skull.

820
00:30:57.899 --> 00:31:02.640
<v Regina>So the density is the issue with that pulse?</v>

821
00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.039
<v ->The pulse. Yeah, right.</v>

822
00:31:04.039 --> 00:31:05.719
<v Regina>The pulse carries that density.</v>

823
00:31:05.719 --> 00:31:07.940
<v ->I mean, if it was that density, constant,</v>

824
00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.999
it would probably kill you in minutes.

825
00:31:10.999 --> 00:31:12.379
It's high energy density.

826
00:31:12.379 --> 00:31:14.779
Now their excuse is, "But it's so short.

827
00:31:14.779 --> 00:31:16.319
"It's only two nanoseconds."

828
00:31:16.319 --> 00:31:17.439
It doesn't matter.

829
00:31:17.439 --> 00:31:22.090
Any amount of high density energy pulsing through your body,

830
00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:23.861
does what it does.

831
00:31:23.861 --> 00:31:25.870
It doesn't matter how short it is.

832
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:29.279
You can go down to zero but anything above zero

833
00:31:29.279 --> 00:31:31.820
is going to damage cellular structure,

834
00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.079
is going to damage DNA.

835
00:31:34.079 --> 00:31:36.060
<v Regina>Now, you've been doing this for a while.</v>

836
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.990
You're very involved in this here,

837
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:39.180
in this community.

838
00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:41.320
Let me ask you, when people decided

839
00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.400
to take action into their own hands,

840
00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.239
and you're saying in your video right up front,

841
00:31:46.239 --> 00:31:48.290
"I'm not saying this is legal,

842
00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:49.679
"I'm not saying this is safe.

843
00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:52.000
"I'm saying this is what you can do,

844
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.979
if you wish to, if you're concerned."

845
00:31:53.979 --> 00:31:56.209
So we'll just put that out, right now.

846
00:31:56.209 --> 00:31:58.919
But what are you noticing is happening to the people

847
00:31:58.919 --> 00:32:00.760
who are switching out their meters,

848
00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.990
when PG&amp;E or Edison or whomever,

849
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:05.780
will not come and do it for them?

850
00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:08.400
<v ->I have a couple of friends who have done that.</v>

851
00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.850
(clears throat)

852
00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.140
It's not pretty.

853
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:18.430
They had the police come to support the power company

854
00:32:18.666 --> 00:32:22.697
in conducting surveillance and radiating their property.

855
00:32:22.697 --> 00:32:24.506
This morning, that happened.

856
00:32:24.506 --> 00:32:27.957
And I had to run out to this other city

857
00:32:27.957 --> 00:32:29.197
with my video camera,

858
00:32:29.197 --> 00:32:32.608
and go over their property and show where

859
00:32:32.608 --> 00:32:35.347
the power company had, with torches or cutting tools,

860
00:32:35.347 --> 00:32:37.237
cut the cages that they had put

861
00:32:37.237 --> 00:32:38.947
over their smart meters, away.

862
00:32:38.947 --> 00:32:40.477
It's those heavy metal, iron--

863
00:32:40.477 --> 00:32:41.967
<v Regina>You mean, over the analog meters?</v>

864
00:32:41.967 --> 00:32:43.607
<v ->Over their analog meters, yeah.</v>

865
00:32:43.607 --> 00:32:46.407
They had pulled out their smart meters on their own,

866
00:32:46.407 --> 00:32:48.726
and they had put in analog meters.

867
00:32:48.726 --> 00:32:50.847
And then they had welded cages over them

868
00:32:50.847 --> 00:32:52.787
with heavy metal, expanded metal,

869
00:32:52.787 --> 00:32:55.847
and L-channel, and all that.

870
00:32:55.847 --> 00:32:58.747
The power company came out and cut those off.

871
00:32:58.747 --> 00:33:02.717
My understanding, this was happening in two cities nearby.

872
00:33:02.717 --> 00:33:05.045
One city, they had the police there.

873
00:33:05.045 --> 00:33:06.845
So I said to them, "Fine."

874
00:33:06.845 --> 00:33:08.485
They're calling me and we're trying to coordinate this

875
00:33:08.485 --> 00:33:09.735
'cause I'm trying to help them,

876
00:33:09.735 --> 00:33:11.965
and I'm running down there shooting video of this.

877
00:33:11.965 --> 00:33:13.195
Well, I got there after they were gone.

878
00:33:13.195 --> 00:33:16.755
But the other address where the police came, I said,

879
00:33:16.755 --> 00:33:20.290
"Well, you're gonna put a police officer in jail,

880
00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:21.950
"unless you're crazy.

881
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:23.931
"Where's the warrant?

882
00:33:23.931 --> 00:33:25.831
"This is breaking and entering."

883
00:33:25.831 --> 00:33:28.780
The power company went on somebody's property,

884
00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:30.791
damaged it, destroyed some property,

885
00:33:30.791 --> 00:33:31.850
and stole the meters.

886
00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:33.070
And here's the thing,

887
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:35.690
when I went to the property in San Gabriel,

888
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:37.811
the analog meters were gone.

889
00:33:37.811 --> 00:33:40.450
Those were not the property of the power company.

890
00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:41.930
They stole property.

891
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:43.391
That's theft. breaking and entering,

892
00:33:43.391 --> 00:33:45.430
burglary, a whole list.

893
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:47.490
If there was a police officer involved in that,

894
00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:49.691
that police officer's a criminal.

895
00:33:49.691 --> 00:33:51.691
They have to have a court order.

896
00:33:51.691 --> 00:33:54.020
If there's a warrant or a court order,

897
00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:56.451
and how do you get a court order that says,

898
00:33:56.451 --> 00:33:59.730
"These people refused to be radiated and surveyed upon?"

899
00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:00.781
How do you get a court order that says--

900
00:34:00.781 --> 00:34:02.810
<v Regina>They would say they rejected the smart meter,</v>

901
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:04.550
they've removed a smart meter.

902
00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:06.551
Is that against the law?

903
00:34:06.551 --> 00:34:08.830
<v ->I don't know that anybody's had occasion</v>

904
00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:10.431
to write a law like that.

905
00:34:10.431 --> 00:34:15.408
So there's probably an easement privilege

906
00:34:15.908 --> 00:34:19.198
that says that they can sanction you somehow,

907
00:34:19.198 --> 00:34:22.038
for tampering with their equipment.

908
00:34:22.038 --> 00:34:23.578
Okay, what is their equipment?

909
00:34:23.578 --> 00:34:26.258
It's an analog meter that doesn't transmit radiation,

910
00:34:26.258 --> 00:34:28.458
that doesn't conduct surveillance on you,

911
00:34:28.458 --> 00:34:30.479
that sits on the side of your house, harmlessly,

912
00:34:30.479 --> 00:34:33.977
that produces one number a month that they can use.

913
00:34:33.977 --> 00:34:36.798
So that's what they're allowed to tell you

914
00:34:36.798 --> 00:34:38.668
to not tamper with.

915
00:34:39.368 --> 00:34:42.038
When they put something there that radiates your property,

916
00:34:42.038 --> 00:34:44.678
that causes you to be under surveillance,

917
00:34:44.678 --> 00:34:48.368
that gives them data sets that they have no entitlement to,

918
00:34:48.368 --> 00:34:49.458
how do you defend that?

919
00:34:49.458 --> 00:34:50.688
There's absolutely no conceivable way.

920
00:34:50.688 --> 00:34:52.539
<v Regina>So there are no court cases yet?</v>

921
00:34:52.539 --> 00:34:54.238
<v ->Not yet. It's all too new.</v>

922
00:34:54.238 --> 00:34:55.648
<v Regina>It's all too new.</v>

923
00:34:55.648 --> 00:34:57.478
<v ->Well now, there may be something I don't know about.</v>

924
00:34:57.478 --> 00:35:00.278
<v Regina>Okay, well this is sounding very discouraging</v>

925
00:35:00.278 --> 00:35:02.150
for the person listening up to this point thinking,

926
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:03.989
"Yeah, I'm gonna get rid of that thing."

927
00:35:03.989 --> 00:35:06.469
To think of the police coming over and essentially busting--

928
00:35:06.469 --> 00:35:08.149
<v ->Well, here's what we do.</v>

929
00:35:08.149 --> 00:35:10.240
Because, yes, of course.

930
00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:13.209
We have a notice, it's a legal notice.

931
00:35:13.209 --> 00:35:15.370
And you get that with your analog meter

932
00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:18.509
that our friends send out.

933
00:35:18.509 --> 00:35:20.759
So you order an analog meter,

934
00:35:20.759 --> 00:35:23.750
this happens to be on FreedomTaker.com.

935
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:24.929
And it's not a plug.

936
00:35:24.929 --> 00:35:26.469
The only reason I say that is because,

937
00:35:26.469 --> 00:35:28.259
I know other people are selling analog meters.

938
00:35:28.259 --> 00:35:32.089
They're not giving you the notice that you have to send.

939
00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:33.509
And you have to send the notice

940
00:35:33.509 --> 00:35:35.329
before you take your meter off.

941
00:35:35.329 --> 00:35:37.410
Otherwise, you are tampering.

942
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:40.209
Nobody's under notice. They haven't noticed you,

943
00:35:40.209 --> 00:35:42.889
that this meter is violating your rights.

944
00:35:42.889 --> 00:35:46.549
So how do you know you have a right to take it off?

945
00:35:46.549 --> 00:35:48.270
<v Regina>But you have to play fair and square,</v>

946
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.389
and you have to put them on notice.

947
00:35:50.389 --> 00:35:52.609
<v ->Right. So you write a notice up and you say,</v>

948
00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:55.150
"I know this is violating my rights.

949
00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:56.810
"I know what this meter does.

950
00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:58.649
"I know that you have no entitlement to do this.

951
00:35:58.649 --> 00:36:01.099
"I know this is not part of your easement,

952
00:36:01.099 --> 00:36:02.949
and you must remove it within 30 days."

953
00:36:02.949 --> 00:36:04.650
So you put it on them.

954
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:07.270
<v Regina>And you send that to the utility company?</v>

955
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:09.149
<v ->Exactly. Certified mail.</v>

956
00:36:09.149 --> 00:36:11.409
If you know how to do notary presentment,

957
00:36:11.409 --> 00:36:12.889
mail agent, this or that.

958
00:36:12.889 --> 00:36:15.159
The most legal way you can do it.

959
00:36:15.159 --> 00:36:17.029
Mail agent means, somebody witnesses

960
00:36:17.029 --> 00:36:18.969
what you put in the envelope and you send it to them.

961
00:36:18.969 --> 00:36:20.890
What these sleazebag lawyers are doing

962
00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:21.990
with the power companies,

963
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:23.709
they'll open your mail, throw it away,

964
00:36:23.709 --> 00:36:25.730
and say, "Yeah, we got your certified envelope.

965
00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:27.329
"There was nothing in it."

966
00:36:27.329 --> 00:36:28.470
<v Regina>Oh.</v>

967
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:30.210
<v ->They're that scumbag!</v>

968
00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:31.810
I mean, that's how far it goes.

969
00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:33.580
How much more do you know,

970
00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:36.239
to know that these people are not dealing fair?

971
00:36:36.239 --> 00:36:37.929
You know, they're pretending these envelopes

972
00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:39.149
come to them empty.

973
00:36:39.149 --> 00:36:40.210
Some lawyers do that.

974
00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:41.809
Now I'm not saying a particular power company

975
00:36:41.809 --> 00:36:43.250
that I know did that,

976
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:45.030
but here's what you do to protect yourself.

977
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:48.710
You get a witness and you say,

978
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:53.710
"I, so and so, my name, I saw that this notice,

979
00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:55.610
"prohibiting smart meter installation

980
00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:57.329
"on this person's property,

981
00:36:57.329 --> 00:37:00.519
"went in this envelope and I mailed this for them."

982
00:37:01.189 --> 00:37:02.900
So now you've got a third-party witness.

983
00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:04.449
It's called a mailing agent,

984
00:37:04.449 --> 00:37:06.190
and many notaries know how to do that.

985
00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:09.669
Our notice is in the form of an Affidavit.

986
00:37:09.669 --> 00:37:12.929
And when you get this analog meter kit

987
00:37:12.929 --> 00:37:15.211
from FreedomTaker.com,

988
00:37:15.211 --> 00:37:17.349
you get this notice that is an Affidavit.

989
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:19.109
So you take it to a notary

990
00:37:19.109 --> 00:37:20.909
and the notary gets your identification,

991
00:37:20.909 --> 00:37:22.330
has you sign it, gets your thumbprint,

992
00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:23.569
whatever they do,

993
00:37:23.569 --> 00:37:25.290
and now you have a legal document

994
00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:27.370
that has more power and more force

995
00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:31.030
than any letter, any statement, any verbal statement.

996
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:34.719
In a courtroom, the judge does not have the prerogative

997
00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:36.169
to rule against that.

998
00:37:36.169 --> 00:37:37.710
That is sworn evidence.

999
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:41.011
<v Regina>Okay. So you protect yourself, first, legally.</v>

1000
00:37:41.011 --> 00:37:43.719
And then we're going to show the video,

1001
00:37:43.719 --> 00:37:46.049
right after this conversation, in a bit here,

1002
00:37:46.049 --> 00:37:48.610
that will show what you do once you have done that.

1003
00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:50.759
The 30 days has passed, nobody's responded.

1004
00:37:50.759 --> 00:37:52.649
And then you start by unlocking the device

1005
00:37:52.649 --> 00:37:53.789
and going from there.

1006
00:37:53.789 --> 00:37:55.790
But before we get into that,

1007
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:57.769
I just have one more question.

1008
00:37:57.769 --> 00:37:59.530
This is all part of a larger agenda.

1009
00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:02.800
We've heard of Agenda 21, for example.

1010
00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:07.490
Is there a way, in the long run, to stop this?

1011
00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:08.839
<v ->Well, sure, but you have to do it</v>

1012
00:38:08.839 --> 00:38:09.919
one meter at a time to begin with.

1013
00:38:09.919 --> 00:38:10.909
<v Regina>One meter at a time.</v>

1014
00:38:10.909 --> 00:38:12.789
Can you talk a little about Agenda 21

1015
00:38:12.789 --> 00:38:15.389
before we finish this part of the conversation?

1016
00:38:15.389 --> 00:38:19.559
<v ->Yeah, it makes no sense, no logical sense whatsoever,</v>

1017
00:38:19.559 --> 00:38:22.300
when you tell your power company that they're

1018
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.749
breaking the law and they're violating your rights,

1019
00:38:24.749 --> 00:38:27.289
that they wouldn't stop doing it.

1020
00:38:27.289 --> 00:38:28.610
It makes no sense.

1021
00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:32.830
What power company wants to violate your rights on purpose?

1022
00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.590
What happens when you tell your power company,

1023
00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:38.130
"You cannot put a smart meter in

1024
00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:39.789
"for this reason, and that reason, and that reason."

1025
00:38:39.789 --> 00:38:42.710
They go, "Too bad, you have to have it."

1026
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:44.489
They're not informing people when they put it on.

1027
00:38:44.489 --> 00:38:46.010
They're not getting their consent.

1028
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:50.239
There was a federal ruling on this and it said,

1029
00:38:51.429 --> 00:38:54.489
"Power companies can offer these to people."

1030
00:38:54.489 --> 00:38:56.069
There's no mandate.

1031
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:58.260
There's no legal mandate for anybody

1032
00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:00.911
to put one of these on anybody's property.

1033
00:39:00.911 --> 00:39:02.570
<v Regina>That's true? They can only offer it?</v>

1034
00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:04.870
That's all they have the right to do?

1035
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:07.969
<v ->There is no law, federal, state, or otherwise,</v>

1036
00:39:07.969 --> 00:39:09.129
that I know about.

1037
00:39:09.129 --> 00:39:11.120
And certainly not federal,

1038
00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.169
that anybody has to have a smart meter.

1039
00:39:13.169 --> 00:39:14.670
It would be ridiculous if there was.

1040
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:16.010
It would last that long,

1041
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:19.010
because it violates the wire-tapping statutes,

1042
00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:22.480
it violates the Fourth Amendment of the Bill of Rights.

1043
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.120
It's just a disaster, legally.

1044
00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.650
So whoever was involved in this federal like,

1045
00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:30.430
"You can offer this," knew that.

1046
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:33.870
They said, "Well, this violates people's rights,

1047
00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:35.700
"it's dangerous to their health,

1048
00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.569
"so you have to volunteer for this.

1049
00:39:37.569 --> 00:39:40.070
"You can offer it, but you can't force it on anybody,

1050
00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:41.989
"for obvious reasons."

1051
00:39:41.989 --> 00:39:44.029
The power companies don't hear any of that.

1052
00:39:44.029 --> 00:39:47.370
And it's bizarre, how deaf and blind they are to that.

1053
00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:50.150
Because we feel like, we outsiders, we energy consumers

1054
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:52.609
are in the position of having to try to educate them?

1055
00:39:52.609 --> 00:39:55.390
We're pretending like they don't know this?

1056
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:57.609
They're pretending like they don't know this?

1057
00:39:57.609 --> 00:39:59.780
There's this big game of pretend going on,

1058
00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:01.250
like, "You don't know this puts out

1059
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:05.220
"pulse electromagnetic radiation into private homes?

1060
00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.509
"You don't know that this conducts surveillance

1061
00:40:07.509 --> 00:40:09.389
"on people's personal activities in the house?

1062
00:40:09.389 --> 00:40:10.730
"Like, we have to tell you that?

1063
00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:12.619
"Okay, fine. Here's your notice."

1064
00:40:12.619 --> 00:40:14.389
And I want to go back to that.

1065
00:40:14.389 --> 00:40:15.729
We're gonna write a notice up and say,

1066
00:40:15.729 --> 00:40:18.889
"You may not do this. You have 30 days to remove this."

1067
00:40:18.889 --> 00:40:21.019
And you say, "This violates my rights.

1068
00:40:21.019 --> 00:40:23.249
"This violates the Fourth Amendment of the Bill of Rights.

1069
00:40:23.249 --> 00:40:25.230
"This violates Title 18.

1070
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:27.890
"This violates these laws.

1071
00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:30.629
"You have 30 days to remove it."

1072
00:40:30.629 --> 00:40:32.599
30 days later...

1073
00:40:32.599 --> 00:40:35.589
They have absolutely no legal standing whatsoever.

1074
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:36.949
Now, again, I'm not a lawyer.

1075
00:40:36.949 --> 00:40:38.929
I'm not trying to give legal advice.

1076
00:40:38.929 --> 00:40:42.911
This is my opinion, this is what I've done.

1077
00:40:42.911 --> 00:40:46.091
I have an analog meter on my house,

1078
00:40:46.091 --> 00:40:50.691
in a city that's 99.8% smart meters.

1079
00:40:50.691 --> 00:40:53.171
And I have a notice posted on the meter that says,

1080
00:40:53.171 --> 00:40:56.052
"You pay a hundred grand if you take this off,

1081
00:40:57.802 --> 00:40:59.262
"because the smart meter violates my rights.

1082
00:40:59.262 --> 00:41:01.282
"If you remove this, it's a hundred grand to you,

1083
00:41:01.282 --> 00:41:04.203
"and you agree to that if you take this off."

1084
00:41:04.203 --> 00:41:06.522
<v Regina>Now have you had any trouble?</v>

1085
00:41:08.192 --> 00:41:10.013
<v ->It depends on what you call "trouble."</v>

1086
00:41:10.013 --> 00:41:12.303
I was lucky enough to be at my house

1087
00:41:12.303 --> 00:41:14.523
when they came to first install this thing.

1088
00:41:14.523 --> 00:41:15.474
The guy came to the door and said,

1089
00:41:15.474 --> 00:41:16.594
"I'm gonna change your meter,"

1090
00:41:16.594 --> 00:41:17.712
and he had the meter under his arm.

1091
00:41:17.712 --> 00:41:18.892
And I said, "Is that a smart meter?"

1092
00:41:18.892 --> 00:41:19.642
And he said, "Yeah."

1093
00:41:19.642 --> 00:41:22.162
I said, "Well, you're not gonna install that on this house

1094
00:41:22.162 --> 00:41:24.102
"unless you want to go to a federal prison

1095
00:41:24.102 --> 00:41:26.062
for wire tapping."

1096
00:41:26.933 --> 00:41:30.703
And he looks at me with this blank stare and says nothing.

1097
00:41:30.703 --> 00:41:32.543
Now this guy knows what he's doing.

1098
00:41:32.543 --> 00:41:33.643
He's pretending, you know,

1099
00:41:33.643 --> 00:41:36.382
down at the installer level they pretend like,

1100
00:41:36.382 --> 00:41:38.073
"Oh, nobody told me that.

1101
00:41:38.073 --> 00:41:39.362
"They told me I have to install this.

1102
00:41:39.362 --> 00:41:42.083
"And I'm sorry, they have this law

1103
00:41:42.083 --> 00:41:43.043
that says you have to have it."

1104
00:41:43.043 --> 00:41:46.023
You know, they'll BS you all day long.

1105
00:41:46.023 --> 00:41:48.562
But this guy just looked at me like,

1106
00:41:48.562 --> 00:41:50.982
"Uh, what else you gotta say?"

1107
00:41:50.982 --> 00:41:54.763
I said, "You're trespassing, leave."

1108
00:41:54.763 --> 00:41:59.322
And so the next day, three guys came back.

1109
00:42:00.192 --> 00:42:02.042
They were across the street and I saw them

1110
00:42:02.042 --> 00:42:04.353
and they said, "Come on over, talk to us about,

1111
00:42:04.353 --> 00:42:05.763
"we'll let you know what's going on."

1112
00:42:05.763 --> 00:42:06.703
And I went over there and they said,

1113
00:42:06.703 --> 00:42:07.623
"Yeah, we've got to put these,

1114
00:42:07.623 --> 00:42:09.173
"we're gonna have these on every home.

1115
00:42:09.173 --> 00:42:11.202
"What do you think you're doing?"

1116
00:42:11.202 --> 00:42:13.163
And I said, "I think I'm causing you to

1117
00:42:13.163 --> 00:42:15.322
"not put it on my home."

1118
00:42:15.322 --> 00:42:16.723
You know, you have to just stand up

1119
00:42:16.723 --> 00:42:18.213
face to face with these people.

1120
00:42:19.423 --> 00:42:22.162
So your question was, Agenda 21.

1121
00:42:23.802 --> 00:42:26.403
This is my way of answering that.

1122
00:42:26.403 --> 00:42:27.993
How could they possibly

1123
00:42:27.993 --> 00:42:31.052
have all of these people so brainwashed,

1124
00:42:31.052 --> 00:42:33.862
city after city after city, state after state,

1125
00:42:33.862 --> 00:42:35.743
power company after power company,

1126
00:42:35.743 --> 00:42:37.062
all across the country?

1127
00:42:37.062 --> 00:42:40.082
Canada? Europe?

1128
00:42:40.082 --> 00:42:41.582
I'm getting emails from Europe.

1129
00:42:41.582 --> 00:42:44.662
I have this Freedom Taker thing on smart meters,

1130
00:42:44.662 --> 00:42:46.042
FreedomTaker.com.

1131
00:42:46.042 --> 00:42:49.422
Europe, Canada, US, all over.

1132
00:42:49.422 --> 00:42:50.743
Same problem.

1133
00:42:50.743 --> 00:42:53.753
Now this is supposedly a local issue, right?

1134
00:42:53.753 --> 00:42:55.501
Power companies,

1135
00:42:55.501 --> 00:42:59.040
they're in lockstep, they're in lockstep on this.

1136
00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.320
They lie to you about what they do,

1137
00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.840
they have the same thing they say,

1138
00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.860
"Oh, it only transmits three minutes a day."

1139
00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.440
They have all this stuff they say,

1140
00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:06.760
everyone, everywhere.

1141
00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.361
Where did that come from?

1142
00:43:08.361 --> 00:43:09.460
Where did that come from?

1143
00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:10.860
Okay, Agenda 21.

1144
00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:12.841
UN, World Trade Organization,

1145
00:43:12.841 --> 00:43:13.920
whoever this is.

1146
00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.020
Council on Foreign Relations,

1147
00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:17.111
I don't know, whatever.

1148
00:43:17.111 --> 00:43:21.521
There's tremendous need to have this data.

1149
00:43:21.521 --> 00:43:23.081
You don't have control without data.

1150
00:43:23.081 --> 00:43:24.881
You don't have knowledge without data.

1151
00:43:24.881 --> 00:43:28.260
So it makes total sense to me

1152
00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:30.710
that there's an international, not a national,

1153
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:33.740
but an international force behind this,

1154
00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:34.980
coordinating this,

1155
00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:37.080
and that's called ICLEI.

1156
00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:37.960
Are you familiar with that name?

1157
00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:38.700
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

1158
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:39.830
<v ->Let's see if we can remember.</v>

1159
00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:42.960
That's International Climate...

1160
00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.020
<v Regina>Don't ask me to say, I'm just familiar with--</v>

1161
00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:49.840
<v ->International Climate Local Environmental Initiative,</v>

1162
00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.940
something along that.

1163
00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:53.880
International is in there.

1164
00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:55.080
Climate is in there.

1165
00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.420
Local is in there.

1166
00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:59.030
So it's International Local.

1167
00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:00.140
That's pretty clear.

1168
00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:02.300
You look up ICLEI on Google, you go to,

1169
00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:04.400
your City Council will know what ICLEI is.

1170
00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.940
Somebody from ICLEI,

1171
00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:10.340
which is an international organization based on the UN,

1172
00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:13.560
somebody from ICLEI has contacted your City Council.

1173
00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:15.940
I guarantee you, I guarantee it!

1174
00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:18.940
How many City Councilors are there in the United States?

1175
00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:21.140
How could I guarantee something as preposterous as say,

1176
00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:23.531
that some UN agency, personally,

1177
00:44:23.531 --> 00:44:25.491
has contacted your City Council.

1178
00:44:25.491 --> 00:44:28.151
You check. You call your City Council people and say,

1179
00:44:28.151 --> 00:44:29.690
"Have you ever heard of ICLEI?

1180
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:32.221
"Has anybody every brought to you

1181
00:44:32.221 --> 00:44:35.190
"an environmental initiative from ICLEI?"

1182
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:37.891
And if they say no, they're lying.

1183
00:44:37.891 --> 00:44:39.990
We have in this city, speed bumps,

1184
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:42.330
and we have these ridiculous curb-cut things

1185
00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:46.030
where they will expand the curb out into the street

1186
00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:48.660
and put a planter box or something there,

1187
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:49.970
so that when you're turning a corner

1188
00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:52.791
you have to go, "Whoops, it's narrow."

1189
00:44:52.791 --> 00:44:54.530
That's ICLEI.

1190
00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:56.471
And I've seen it in city after city after city.

1191
00:44:56.471 --> 00:44:57.950
<v Regina>Oh yeah, yeah.</v>

1192
00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:02.490
<v ->The idea is, make cities unhospitable to cars.</v>

1193
00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:03.691
<v Regina>Yep. Un-navigable for cars.</v>

1194
00:45:03.691 --> 00:45:04.970
<v ->We want people walking,</v>

1195
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:06.431
we want people on their bikes,

1196
00:45:06.431 --> 00:45:09.850
we want people to hurt if they use their car.

1197
00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:11.371
We want people to slow down,

1198
00:45:11.371 --> 00:45:13.790
we want people to not get there as fast.

1199
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:15.271
<v Regina>And that's all part of ICLEI, huh?</v>

1200
00:45:15.271 --> 00:45:16.471
<v ->ICLEI, Agenda 21.
<v Regina>I wondered where</v>

1201
00:45:16.471 --> 00:45:17.402
that came from in the last five years.

1202
00:45:17.402 --> 00:45:20.550
<v ->Yeah, and you know it's going on in every city.</v>

1203
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:22.411
I mean, you can go around and cities are all proud

1204
00:45:22.411 --> 00:45:23.950
of these new improvements.

1205
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:25.892
And they will show you pictures on their websites

1206
00:45:25.892 --> 00:45:30.080
of all their new planter boxes in the middle of the street!

1207
00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.421
And I have a big problem with that

1208
00:45:32.421 --> 00:45:35.590
because we build nice, wide, clean, flat streets

1209
00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:37.490
so that we can get places efficiently.

1210
00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:40.371
The emergency people, the fire and the police,

1211
00:45:40.371 --> 00:45:42.451
are crazy about this because they go,

1212
00:45:42.451 --> 00:45:44.711
"I can't swerve around these things

1213
00:45:44.711 --> 00:45:46.670
"when I'm trying to save a life!

1214
00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:47.841
"What are you thinking?"

1215
00:45:47.841 --> 00:45:48.800
<v Regina>Yeah, they're crazy.</v>

1216
00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.270
They don't even seem to make sense,

1217
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:51.350
the way they're set up.

1218
00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:53.590
<v ->Right. So the cities are getting so much influence.</v>

1219
00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:56.171
Can you imagine how much influence there has to be,

1220
00:45:56.171 --> 00:45:58.650
that the city will ignore their own fire department?

1221
00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:00.391
Ignore their own police force?

1222
00:46:00.391 --> 00:46:01.690
And just say, "That's too bad.

1223
00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:02.830
"We've got ICLEI telling us

1224
00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:04.831
'this is good for the environment.'"

1225
00:46:04.831 --> 00:46:06.911
<v Regina>Interesting. So that's how far it goes.</v>

1226
00:46:06.911 --> 00:46:10.241
Okay, well, um, I really,

1227
00:46:10.241 --> 00:46:12.610
I appreciate the fact that A, you've taken this thing on

1228
00:46:12.610 --> 00:46:14.771
and that you are assisting people.

1229
00:46:14.771 --> 00:46:16.711
We have to get on our part of it,

1230
00:46:16.711 --> 00:46:18.131
Scott and I, personally.

1231
00:46:18.131 --> 00:46:19.511
And meanwhile, what we're going to do

1232
00:46:19.511 --> 00:46:22.910
is have people go next to the video itself,

1233
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:26.010
so they can see what the process and procedure is

1234
00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:27.311
and what it looks like,

1235
00:46:27.311 --> 00:46:30.290
to remove one of the smart meters

1236
00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:32.030
and then install an analog meter.

1237
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:34.271
Which you say, please have on hand,

1238
00:46:34.271 --> 00:46:37.962
a good electrician and possibly an attorney.

1239
00:46:37.962 --> 00:46:40.051
<v ->Yeah, well I want to make something clear if I have time.</v>

1240
00:46:40.051 --> 00:46:41.671
Because, when you asked me earlier,

1241
00:46:41.671 --> 00:46:42.940
"What happens if you change it?"

1242
00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:45.020
And I said it could get ugly,

1243
00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:47.570
that's for people who don't send them the notice.

1244
00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:50.430
<v Regina>Yes, and that's good. You made that clear.</v>

1245
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:51.990
<v ->Protect yourself with that notice.</v>

1246
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:53.471
Once you put them on notice,

1247
00:46:53.471 --> 00:46:56.141
"This smart meter violates my rights,"

1248
00:46:56.141 --> 00:46:57.730
there's no way they can do anything.

1249
00:46:57.730 --> 00:46:59.392
Now will they try? Maybe.

1250
00:46:59.392 --> 00:47:02.330
You know, you have to decide how courageous you are.

1251
00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:03.811
You have to decide how much you want to

1252
00:47:03.811 --> 00:47:07.091
protect your family from radiation and privacy issues.

1253
00:47:07.091 --> 00:47:10.691
But, once you send that notice,

1254
00:47:10.691 --> 00:47:12.491
if our courts were not corrupt,

1255
00:47:12.491 --> 00:47:14.691
if our legal system worked the way it should,

1256
00:47:14.691 --> 00:47:16.410
justice system worked the way it should,

1257
00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:19.140
there's absolutely no way anybody could touch you

1258
00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:20.630
once you've noticed them that they are

1259
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:21.730
violating your rights.

1260
00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:23.950
And then you are going to have an analog meter.

1261
00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:26.011
"You have 30 days to put that meter there.

1262
00:47:26.011 --> 00:47:27.531
"If you don't, I will do it.

1263
00:47:27.531 --> 00:47:29.531
"And don't even think about interfering with me.

1264
00:47:29.531 --> 00:47:31.690
"And don't even think about taking that back off

1265
00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:33.761
"and putting a smart meter in because then,

1266
00:47:33.761 --> 00:47:34.790
"you're on notice.

1267
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:35.990
"You're on violation."

1268
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:39.930
Now you have full, intentional, criminal liability.

1269
00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:42.550
<v Regina>Very good.</v>

1270
00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:45.191
Okay, on that note, go to Part Two

1271
00:47:45.191 --> 00:47:48.391
and watch what this looks like in real life.

1272
00:47:48.391 --> 00:47:50.030
And meanwhile, I want to thank you for our time.

1273
00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:50.550
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1274
00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:52.211
<v Regina>And thank you for letting us use this video too,</v>

1275
00:47:52.211 --> 00:47:53.072
this upcoming video.

1276
00:47:53.072 --> 00:47:55.471
<v ->Sure, I hope a lot of people see it.</v>

1277
00:47:55.471 --> 00:47:56.731
<v Regina>I hope so too.</v>

1278
00:47:56.731 --> 00:47:57.930
Well, we're going to do our part,

1279
00:47:57.930 --> 00:47:59.890
and we'll find out how our local

1280
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:03.390
PG&amp;E workmen,

1281
00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:06.961
how they respond to it.

1282
00:48:06.961 --> 00:48:09.142
Scott'll take that part on.

1283
00:48:09.142 --> 00:48:10.311
<v ->Good.</v>

1284
00:48:10.311 --> 00:48:11.331
<v Regina>I'll hide in the kitchen. (laughing)</v>

1285
00:48:11.331 --> 00:48:13.250
<v ->Put the man on that one.</v>

1286
00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:14.431
<v Regina>Thanks so much, Jerry.</v>

1287
00:48:14.431 --> 00:48:15.680
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1288
00:48:16.831 --> 00:48:18.447
<v ->You can contact Jerry directly,</v>

1289
00:48:18.447 --> 00:48:20.667
to get the paperwork and the analog meter

1290
00:48:20.667 --> 00:48:23.227
by going to FreedomTaker.com.

1291
00:48:23.227 --> 00:48:25.448
To learn more about the effects of not only the meters,

1292
00:48:25.448 --> 00:48:27.747
but the electrical circuitry throughout your home,

1293
00:48:27.747 --> 00:48:29.727
you might also enjoy our interviews with

1294
00:48:29.727 --> 00:48:31.866
Donna Fisher and David Stetzer.

1295
00:48:31.866 --> 00:48:33.987
Some of this information is shocking.

1296
00:48:33.987 --> 00:48:37.337
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1297
00:48:53.047 --> 00:48:54.746
Well now that the cat is out of the bag

1298
00:48:54.746 --> 00:48:56.226
and we all know that smart meters

1299
00:48:56.226 --> 00:48:58.237
emit dangerous radiation

1300
00:48:58.237 --> 00:49:01.514
and spy on people's personal activities inside their homes,

1301
00:49:01.514 --> 00:49:03.744
it seems a bit odd that the power companies

1302
00:49:03.744 --> 00:49:06.463
are still pretending they don't do that.

1303
00:49:06.463 --> 00:49:08.203
I guess they're not familiar with the term,

1304
00:49:08.203 --> 00:49:10.254
"criminal liability."

1305
00:49:10.254 --> 00:49:11.473
Maybe they've had their heads

1306
00:49:11.473 --> 00:49:14.344
too close to their smart meters for a little too long.

1307
00:49:14.344 --> 00:49:15.475
Now you might be one of those people

1308
00:49:15.475 --> 00:49:17.343
who would sue your power company

1309
00:49:17.343 --> 00:49:20.443
after they make your family sick from radiation,

1310
00:49:20.443 --> 00:49:22.944
spy on you, jack up your electric bill

1311
00:49:22.944 --> 00:49:24.463
for using your washing machine

1312
00:49:24.463 --> 00:49:26.144
at the wrong time of day,

1313
00:49:26.144 --> 00:49:28.483
and randomly shut off your appliances

1314
00:49:28.483 --> 00:49:30.943
to balance their grid load stresses.

1315
00:49:30.943 --> 00:49:33.464
But this video is for people who like to prevent

1316
00:49:33.464 --> 00:49:35.764
those kinds of things from happening to them,

1317
00:49:35.764 --> 00:49:37.443
in the first place.

1318
00:49:37.443 --> 00:49:39.633
This video will demonstrate the option

1319
00:49:39.633 --> 00:49:41.433
of replacing your smart meter

1320
00:49:41.433 --> 00:49:44.183
with a safe and sane analog meter.

1321
00:49:44.183 --> 00:49:47.424
We're not saying this is lawful, safe, or practical,

1322
00:49:47.424 --> 00:49:49.874
but many people are looking for options,

1323
00:49:49.874 --> 00:49:51.983
and this may be one of them.

1324
00:49:51.983 --> 00:49:54.024
It's true, you can buy your very own

1325
00:49:54.024 --> 00:49:57.003
safe analog electric meter.

1326
00:49:57.003 --> 00:49:58.803
In fact, you can find a special kit

1327
00:49:58.803 --> 00:50:00.303
to replace your smart meter

1328
00:50:00.303 --> 00:50:03.684
at the website called FreedomTaker.com.

1329
00:50:03.684 --> 00:50:07.003
Will the power company like you replacing their meter?

1330
00:50:07.003 --> 00:50:09.673
Well, if the only way they can be happy

1331
00:50:09.673 --> 00:50:12.123
is to try to give you a meter that pollutes your home

1332
00:50:12.123 --> 00:50:14.385
with carcinogenic electrotoxins

1333
00:50:14.385 --> 00:50:16.804
and violates federal wire-tapping laws,

1334
00:50:16.804 --> 00:50:18.304
I guess they won't be happy

1335
00:50:18.304 --> 00:50:22.604
because a lot of people are not going to sit still for that.

1336
00:50:22.604 --> 00:50:24.513
Let's see, do I want to protect my family's

1337
00:50:24.513 --> 00:50:25.653
health and privacy,

1338
00:50:25.653 --> 00:50:28.603
or make my power company happy?

1339
00:50:28.603 --> 00:50:29.524
Yeah.

1340
00:50:29.524 --> 00:50:31.004
You're about to see some people

1341
00:50:31.004 --> 00:50:33.324
changing their own electric meter.

1342
00:50:33.324 --> 00:50:35.024
But these people are experienced

1343
00:50:35.024 --> 00:50:37.224
in the construction industry.

1344
00:50:37.224 --> 00:50:39.383
Certainly, most people would need to

1345
00:50:39.383 --> 00:50:43.974
hire a qualified electrician to do the meter swap fandango.

1346
00:50:43.974 --> 00:50:45.963
A mishap with house current can be

1347
00:50:45.963 --> 00:50:49.204
both embarrassing and fatal.

1348
00:50:49.204 --> 00:50:50.963
Smart meters violate the law,

1349
00:50:50.963 --> 00:50:53.563
and they violate your power company's easement,

1350
00:50:53.563 --> 00:50:56.043
by emitting radiation on your property

1351
00:50:56.043 --> 00:50:58.943
and monitoring personal activities in the home.

1352
00:50:58.943 --> 00:51:01.084
But if you intend to remove the meter,

1353
00:51:01.084 --> 00:51:03.944
you must take a very important legal step

1354
00:51:03.944 --> 00:51:05.703
of informing your power company

1355
00:51:05.703 --> 00:51:07.813
that the meter violates the law,

1356
00:51:07.813 --> 00:51:10.024
and must be removed.

1357
00:51:10.024 --> 00:51:12.524
That legal notice document comes with

1358
00:51:12.524 --> 00:51:13.964
the Freedom Taker kit.

1359
00:51:13.964 --> 00:51:16.804
It's five pages long and is a powerhouse

1360
00:51:16.804 --> 00:51:19.124
of legal karate chops.

1361
00:51:19.124 --> 00:51:21.173
Fill it out, get it notarized,

1362
00:51:21.173 --> 00:51:25.184
send it certified mail, and watch grown men cry.

1363
00:51:25.184 --> 00:51:28.584
The kit includes instructions for both mailing the notice,

1364
00:51:28.584 --> 00:51:31.874
and physically replacing the meter.

1365
00:51:31.874 --> 00:51:33.884
Once you send them this notice,

1366
00:51:33.884 --> 00:51:36.584
they should understand that the only lawful way

1367
00:51:36.584 --> 00:51:38.464
a smart meter can be used,

1368
00:51:38.464 --> 00:51:41.143
is as a jello mold.

1369
00:51:41.143 --> 00:51:43.325
The power company will bully you and tell you

1370
00:51:43.325 --> 00:51:46.404
they have an easement or right of access.

1371
00:51:46.404 --> 00:51:48.344
You can tell them they have an easement

1372
00:51:48.344 --> 00:51:50.184
for an analog meter.

1373
00:51:50.184 --> 00:51:52.994
They do not have an easement or consent

1374
00:51:52.994 --> 00:51:56.864
for a radiation-emitting surveillance device.

1375
00:51:56.864 --> 00:52:00.184
The power companies seem to be living in a pretend world

1376
00:52:00.184 --> 00:52:02.143
they have made for themselves.

1377
00:52:02.143 --> 00:52:03.894
They have the mentality that they could put

1378
00:52:03.894 --> 00:52:06.014
a hand grenade on the side of your house,

1379
00:52:06.014 --> 00:52:08.514
and you would have no right to object.

1380
00:52:08.514 --> 00:52:10.934
You can't have a rational conversation

1381
00:52:10.934 --> 00:52:12.614
with people like that.

1382
00:52:12.614 --> 00:52:14.914
If they don't want to admit that smart meters

1383
00:52:14.914 --> 00:52:16.895
are dangerous and invasive,

1384
00:52:16.895 --> 00:52:20.454
it is better to just put the power company on notice

1385
00:52:20.454 --> 00:52:22.294
and take your own corrective action,

1386
00:52:22.294 --> 00:52:24.334
as I will show you now.

1387
00:52:24.334 --> 00:52:27.255
Please talk to an electrician and an attorney

1388
00:52:27.255 --> 00:52:29.954
before considering these actions.

1389
00:52:29.954 --> 00:52:31.675
So let's say you've sent the legal notice

1390
00:52:31.675 --> 00:52:34.754
from the meter replacement kit at FreedomTaker.com,

1391
00:52:34.754 --> 00:52:36.374
you have given the power company

1392
00:52:36.374 --> 00:52:38.274
a reasonable amount of time,

1393
00:52:38.274 --> 00:52:39.555
three to four weeks,

1394
00:52:39.555 --> 00:52:40.854
to do the right thing,

1395
00:52:40.854 --> 00:52:44.035
and they refuse or fail to replace your smart meter

1396
00:52:44.035 --> 00:52:45.255
with an analog meter,

1397
00:52:45.255 --> 00:52:47.014
in a timely manner.

1398
00:52:47.014 --> 00:52:49.274
Now we can put the formalities aside,

1399
00:52:49.274 --> 00:52:52.474
and get down to the meter yanking.

1400
00:52:52.474 --> 00:52:54.314
Again, this is business for an electrician

1401
00:52:54.314 --> 00:52:56.944
or someone who knows how to stay out of the way

1402
00:52:56.944 --> 00:52:59.534
of high voltage do-dads.

1403
00:52:59.534 --> 00:53:02.814
So I'm speaking now to your electrician.

1404
00:53:02.814 --> 00:53:04.694
You get the analog meter out of the kit

1405
00:53:04.694 --> 00:53:06.834
and head over to the service panel.

1406
00:53:06.834 --> 00:53:08.874
To prevent tampering and vandalism,

1407
00:53:08.874 --> 00:53:12.015
many electric meters have locks on the mounting ring.

1408
00:53:12.015 --> 00:53:14.315
Some electricians have keys to these.

1409
00:53:14.315 --> 00:53:16.454
Most locksmiths do not.

1410
00:53:16.454 --> 00:53:18.234
This is your biggest problem.

1411
00:53:18.234 --> 00:53:20.874
Nobody has a right to lock something on your home

1412
00:53:20.874 --> 00:53:23.594
that emits radiation and spies on you.

1413
00:53:23.594 --> 00:53:25.914
This lock must go.

1414
00:53:25.914 --> 00:53:28.694
The legal notice in the Freedom Taker kit

1415
00:53:28.694 --> 00:53:31.154
actually cites laws and statutes

1416
00:53:31.154 --> 00:53:32.654
that the smart meter violates,

1417
00:53:32.654 --> 00:53:34.934
and that gives the homeowner the right to remove

1418
00:53:34.934 --> 00:53:38.064
the smart meter by any means necessary.

1419
00:53:38.064 --> 00:53:40.595
That does not mean forcing, pounding, or levering

1420
00:53:40.595 --> 00:53:43.114
on the electric panel or the smart meter.

1421
00:53:43.114 --> 00:53:46.314
That will simply break things and electrocute you.

1422
00:53:46.314 --> 00:53:49.215
You must be gentle, delicate, and competent,

1423
00:53:49.215 --> 00:53:51.494
and use the proper tools.

1424
00:53:51.494 --> 00:53:53.915
You should avoid anything like this,

1425
00:53:53.915 --> 00:53:55.574
that may cause collateral damage

1426
00:53:55.574 --> 00:53:58.254
and create an electrical hazard.

1427
00:53:58.254 --> 00:53:59.934
Let's just say you found a way

1428
00:53:59.934 --> 00:54:02.534
to safely remove the lock.

1429
00:54:02.534 --> 00:54:04.734
To replace your meter, you will have to shut off

1430
00:54:04.734 --> 00:54:06.174
your power to the house,

1431
00:54:06.174 --> 00:54:08.195
so go in the house and shut down your computers

1432
00:54:08.195 --> 00:54:11.454
and make sure that no harm will come to anything or anyone

1433
00:54:11.454 --> 00:54:14.734
from a power outage at the service panel.

1434
00:54:14.734 --> 00:54:15.955
The most important thing to do

1435
00:54:15.955 --> 00:54:19.494
is shut off the main breaker switch in the service panel,

1436
00:54:19.494 --> 00:54:21.364
so there's no electrical current

1437
00:54:21.364 --> 00:54:23.834
flowing from the meter into the home.

1438
00:54:23.834 --> 00:54:25.534
This is absolutely critical.

1439
00:54:25.534 --> 00:54:27.574
If you're not sure that current to the house

1440
00:54:27.574 --> 00:54:28.774
has been shut off,

1441
00:54:28.774 --> 00:54:30.194
do not proceed.

1442
00:54:30.194 --> 00:54:31.884
You might even want to flip off

1443
00:54:31.884 --> 00:54:34.715
all the individual line breakers just to be sure.

1444
00:54:34.715 --> 00:54:36.994
But this is no time to relax.

1445
00:54:36.994 --> 00:54:38.914
Even with everything shut down,

1446
00:54:38.914 --> 00:54:41.635
you are not safe from live current.

1447
00:54:41.635 --> 00:54:43.775
There is no way to shut off the current

1448
00:54:43.775 --> 00:54:45.174
coming from the power pole

1449
00:54:45.174 --> 00:54:46.674
right into your service panel,

1450
00:54:46.674 --> 00:54:48.595
and that's the highest voltage.

1451
00:54:48.595 --> 00:54:50.975
This is serious business.

1452
00:54:50.975 --> 00:54:53.094
With the main power switch shut off,

1453
00:54:53.094 --> 00:54:55.775
look at the smart meter and write down the readings

1454
00:54:55.775 --> 00:54:57.594
from the digital display.

1455
00:54:57.594 --> 00:54:59.494
Again, the meter itself is still powered

1456
00:54:59.494 --> 00:55:01.964
by the incoming current.

1457
00:55:01.964 --> 00:55:04.334
So this is how you will prove to the electric company

1458
00:55:04.334 --> 00:55:06.974
that you're not trying to steal electricity.

1459
00:55:06.974 --> 00:55:09.735
Be careful to get these numbers accurately.

1460
00:55:09.735 --> 00:55:12.415
The digital display will blink and cycle through

1461
00:55:12.415 --> 00:55:15.394
three or four displays every few seconds.

1462
00:55:15.394 --> 00:55:17.754
Copy every number that comes up.

1463
00:55:17.754 --> 00:55:20.675
If you miss one, it will repeat again and again.

1464
00:55:20.675 --> 00:55:22.355
Get them all and save those numbers

1465
00:55:22.355 --> 00:55:25.214
to give to the power company when you return the meter.

1466
00:55:25.214 --> 00:55:29.194
That way they cannot say you're trying to steal electricity.

1467
00:55:29.194 --> 00:55:31.014
Now you're about to expose some

1468
00:55:31.014 --> 00:55:33.535
live, high-voltage contacts.

1469
00:55:33.535 --> 00:55:36.134
At this point, please have all bystanders

1470
00:55:36.134 --> 00:55:40.374
and sugar-jacked children go far away.

1471
00:55:40.374 --> 00:55:43.914
Assuming you gently and safely removed the ring lock,

1472
00:55:43.914 --> 00:55:45.735
remove the stiff metal locking ring

1473
00:55:45.735 --> 00:55:49.355
by expanding the ring and sliding it over the meter.

1474
00:55:49.355 --> 00:55:52.425
These rings are very strong so brush up on all your

1475
00:55:52.425 --> 00:55:55.434
cuss words before you do this.

1476
00:55:55.434 --> 00:55:59.575
Save all the parts for your power company gift basket.

1477
00:55:59.575 --> 00:56:02.494
There are four stiff prongs and sockets

1478
00:56:02.494 --> 00:56:03.915
in the back of the meter.

1479
00:56:03.915 --> 00:56:07.235
Basically, the whole meter just plugs in.

1480
00:56:07.235 --> 00:56:10.974
Once again, being totally sure the electricity is shut off,

1481
00:56:10.974 --> 00:56:13.254
simply remove the meter by firmly pulling

1482
00:56:13.254 --> 00:56:15.434
the top of the meter toward you,

1483
00:56:15.434 --> 00:56:16.714
then pull the bottom,

1484
00:56:16.714 --> 00:56:20.334
and pull the meter free of the mounting panel.

1485
00:56:20.334 --> 00:56:22.955
Don't rock the meter side to side if you can avoid it.

1486
00:56:22.955 --> 00:56:26.634
It may jam the prongs and make removal more difficult.

1487
00:56:26.634 --> 00:56:28.474
Keep every part of your body,

1488
00:56:28.474 --> 00:56:29.775
and every loose object,

1489
00:56:29.775 --> 00:56:32.655
well away from those sockets.

1490
00:56:32.655 --> 00:56:34.595
As soon as you remove the smart meter,

1491
00:56:34.595 --> 00:56:37.094
you will simply plug in your new analog meter

1492
00:56:37.094 --> 00:56:39.554
in the same logical position.

1493
00:56:39.554 --> 00:56:41.874
Carefully hold the analog meter vertically

1494
00:56:41.874 --> 00:56:44.714
and align it with the mounting sockets.

1495
00:56:44.714 --> 00:56:47.745
Hold the bottom in a little closer than the top,

1496
00:56:47.745 --> 00:56:50.004
feel the fit to determine that the prongs

1497
00:56:50.004 --> 00:56:52.255
are aligned with the sockets,

1498
00:56:52.255 --> 00:56:56.355
press the bottom in and then follow quickly with the top.

1499
00:56:56.355 --> 00:56:58.455
Then apply firm, overall pressure,

1500
00:56:58.455 --> 00:57:00.875
until you're sure the meter is seated fully

1501
00:57:00.875 --> 00:57:02.796
and deeply in the sockets.

1502
00:57:02.796 --> 00:57:05.316
Again, don't pound on the meter.

1503
00:57:05.316 --> 00:57:08.476
Your FreedomTaker.com meter replacement kit

1504
00:57:08.476 --> 00:57:10.334
includes a mounting ring.

1505
00:57:10.334 --> 00:57:13.115
Fasten the mounting ring at the base of the meter.

1506
00:57:13.115 --> 00:57:15.875
Now turn the main power switch back on,

1507
00:57:15.875 --> 00:57:19.145
and turn on any breakers that were turned off.

1508
00:57:19.145 --> 00:57:21.575
Unless some of your appliances come back on,

1509
00:57:21.575 --> 00:57:23.895
you may not see any reading or motion

1510
00:57:23.895 --> 00:57:26.334
in the analog meter, immediately.

1511
00:57:26.334 --> 00:57:27.094
To check that,

1512
00:57:27.094 --> 00:57:29.575
you can go turn a few things on inside the house

1513
00:57:29.575 --> 00:57:31.774
and come back out and look at the meter.

1514
00:57:31.774 --> 00:57:32.954
In an analog meter,

1515
00:57:32.954 --> 00:57:36.454
there is no digital screen so you will see the wheel spin

1516
00:57:36.454 --> 00:57:39.404
to verify operation.

1517
00:57:39.404 --> 00:57:41.895
You want to return the smart meter to the power company

1518
00:57:41.895 --> 00:57:43.594
as soon as possible.

1519
00:57:43.594 --> 00:57:45.214
Attach a note to the smart meter

1520
00:57:45.214 --> 00:57:48.334
to identify the address from which it was taken,

1521
00:57:48.334 --> 00:57:51.635
and the date and approximate time it was removed.

1522
00:57:51.635 --> 00:57:54.694
Include that note you made with the numbers you copied

1523
00:57:54.694 --> 00:57:58.554
from the smart meter display just before you removed it.

1524
00:57:58.554 --> 00:58:01.355
Now it would be very wise to take pictures

1525
00:58:01.355 --> 00:58:03.334
of everything you're sending back to the power company

1526
00:58:03.334 --> 00:58:06.156
so you can prove you've done everything correctly.

1527
00:58:06.156 --> 00:58:09.196
Also, photograph your newly-installed analog meter

1528
00:58:09.196 --> 00:58:11.634
in case they come and mess with it.

1529
00:58:11.634 --> 00:58:13.895
Expect some sort of intimidating bluster

1530
00:58:13.895 --> 00:58:16.215
from your power company at some point.

1531
00:58:16.215 --> 00:58:18.752
You may need to rebut them with your evidence.

1532
00:58:18.752 --> 00:58:21.752
Back up and save those photos in a safe place.

1533
00:58:21.752 --> 00:58:23.892
If your power company starts to make up stories

1534
00:58:23.892 --> 00:58:25.853
about improper installation,

1535
00:58:25.853 --> 00:58:28.972
damage to their equipment, or theft of electricity,

1536
00:58:28.972 --> 00:58:31.152
your evidence, photos, and records

1537
00:58:31.152 --> 00:58:34.163
will be all you have to protect yourself.

1538
00:58:34.163 --> 00:58:35.522
As soon as possible,

1539
00:58:35.522 --> 00:58:37.162
return that meter and all parts

1540
00:58:37.162 --> 00:58:39.092
to your electric company in a way that,

1541
00:58:39.092 --> 00:58:41.952
later, you can prove it was delivered to them.

1542
00:58:41.952 --> 00:58:44.131
If you have a packing and shipping store

1543
00:58:44.131 --> 00:58:46.051
or a UPS store nearby,

1544
00:58:46.051 --> 00:58:48.932
they will safely pack the meter for shipping.

1545
00:58:48.932 --> 00:58:50.932
Save the tracking slip.

1546
00:58:50.932 --> 00:58:54.293
Keep that with the mail receipts and your notice

1547
00:58:54.293 --> 00:58:56.903
that you sent to the power company some weeks earlier.

1548
00:58:56.903 --> 00:59:00.192
Put it all in a file together and keep it in a safe place.

1549
00:59:00.192 --> 00:59:03.192
If you get the Safe Electric Meter Replacement Kit

1550
00:59:03.192 --> 00:59:04.912
from FreedomTaker.com,

1551
00:59:04.912 --> 00:59:06.871
you can now top off the installation

1552
00:59:06.871 --> 00:59:10.932
by clipping on the smart meter refusal warning tag,

1553
00:59:10.932 --> 00:59:13.592
so your power company will owe you a bunch of money

1554
00:59:13.592 --> 00:59:16.622
if they mess with your analog meter.

1555
00:59:16.622 --> 00:59:20.292
Now you may enjoy the privacy, safety, and health you had

1556
00:59:20.292 --> 00:59:22.882
before your power company changed all that

1557
00:59:22.882 --> 00:59:24.640
with a smart meter.
