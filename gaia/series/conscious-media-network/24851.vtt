00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The pre-eminent researcher
in ufology, Linda Moulton Howe,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.870 align:middle line:84%
tells us that after
28 years of research,

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.870 align:middle line:84%
that we can no longer afford
to ignore the fact that aliens

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.200 align:middle line:84%
have been visiting and working
with Earth and its species

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.280 align:middle line:90%
for millennia.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.370 align:middle line:84%
She believes the cover-up is
inspired by the power elites'

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.210 align:middle line:84%
greed to foist outdated and
environmentally damaging

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.880 align:middle line:84%
fossil fuel-based
technologies upon us, when

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.160 align:middle line:84%
alien technologies may hold
the key to our future recovery

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.960 align:middle line:90%
of planet Earth.

00:00:37.325 --> 00:00:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Would it be fair to say that
you're one of the few people

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.100 align:middle line:84%
out there that can really
take on the "X-Files,"

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.460 align:middle line:84%
and know what this means, and
be able to help decipher this

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.600 align:middle line:90%
information?

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>> It was, in fact, the calls
from Chris Carter in that

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.170 align:middle line:84%
office in the real
"X-Files" TV series,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.340 align:middle line:84%
coming to me for material on all
of the various subjects that I

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.250 align:middle line:84%
was investigating, including
animal mutilations,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.040 align:middle line:84%
human abductions, crop
circles, and so forth,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.800 align:middle line:84%
that as their series
went on television--

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and I had reached
a point by 1999,

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.990 align:middle line:84%
where I was so tired of the
blocks, and the nos, and no,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.180 align:middle line:84%
we will not do that
subject in a book,

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.020 align:middle line:84%
we will not do that
subject on television--

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.300 align:middle line:84%
that it was what
inspired me to want

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.330 align:middle line:84%
to do a news website
that would be

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.850 align:middle line:90%
science and environment based.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:84%
That's where I've always done
my investigative journalism.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.100 align:middle line:84%
But I could add real X
files-- my tip to Chris Carter

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and the real "X-Files--" and
do it in the context of hard

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.930 align:middle line:84%
forensic evidence, and going
after the hard physical data,

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.700 align:middle line:84%
and putting it in the context
of science and environment,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.590 align:middle line:84%
to help audiences realize we are
dealing with real phenomenon.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.470 align:middle line:90%
This is not paranormal.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.240 align:middle line:84%
This is not something that is in
a superstition or a mythology.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.240 align:middle line:84%
We have actual
non-human intelligences

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.120 align:middle line:84%
interacting with this
planet, from people

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.610 align:middle line:84%
that I've talked to
in the government

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.650 align:middle line:84%
over 28 years, who have talked
to me largely off the record.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.630 align:middle line:84%
The implication is
that we're dealing

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.900 align:middle line:84%
with one or more non-human
intelligences that

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.760 align:middle line:84%
have been interacting with
the planet for millennia.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.090 align:middle line:90%
It did not start in 1947.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.220 align:middle line:90%
It did not start in 1847.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.810 align:middle line:84%
It's been going on
for a very long time.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And the big question
is, why in the 1940s,

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.300 align:middle line:84%
did it seem to shift gears into
a kind of perpetual presence

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.420 align:middle line:84%
of the discs, the
cylinders, and these craft

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.360 align:middle line:84%
that were being reported,
followed by, in 1961,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.140 align:middle line:84%
at least the first documented
case of Betty and Barney Hill,

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.150 align:middle line:84%
as the first publicly reported
human abduction syndrome

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and throughout
that whole period,

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.360 align:middle line:84%
going back, really, to the
beginning of the 20th century

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:84%
were all of the worldwide
animal mutilations?

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.980 align:middle line:90%
And what was common to both?

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.910 align:middle line:84%
In the animal mutilations,
every country of the world

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.960 align:middle line:90%
has had them.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.000 align:middle line:84%
There have been all of
these eyewitness reports

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.940 align:middle line:84%
about beams of light,
mysterious lights.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Some farmers have
told me that they

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.500 align:middle line:84%
have seen animals rise
in beams of light,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.640 align:middle line:84%
or be lowered in
beams of light--

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.120 align:middle line:90%
eyewitness testimony.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Jump over to the human
abduction syndrome,

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.610 align:middle line:84%
and you have lights, mysterious
lights, beams of light.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Some people think that they've
seen a human or two rise

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.400 align:middle line:90%
in these beams of light.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.940 align:middle line:84%
It suggests the same kind
of lifting technology

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.170 align:middle line:84%
is being used in the animals
and then in the humans,

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.030 align:middle line:84%
but the difference is
humans are returned.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.590 align:middle line:90%
They have missing time.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.160 align:middle line:84%
They cannot remember how they
got from point A to point B,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.310 align:middle line:84%
driving in a car,
walking in their yard.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Something has
happened, but they are

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:84%
returned, perhaps with
trauma, but otherwise, they're

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:90%
all right.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.280 align:middle line:84%
But the animals
are returned dead

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.380 align:middle line:84%
and with the same pattern
of excisions, bloodless,

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.269 align:middle line:90%
and no tracks around them.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And when I started trying
to get to the bottom

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.780 align:middle line:84%
of the worldwide animal
mutilation mystery, September

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.650 align:middle line:84%
of '79, it was law
enforcement who were saying,

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Linda, we know
it's not predator,

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.480 align:middle line:84%
we know it's not disease, and
we know it's not satanic cults.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.650 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with
creatures from outer space.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.690 align:middle line:84%
That is what law
enforcement was telling me.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:48.220 align:middle line:84%
But it took eight or nine weeks
of all of these discussions

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.460 align:middle line:84%
with law enforcement
to get one to go

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.380 align:middle line:84%
on the record with
the camera running,

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.040 align:middle line:90%
and that was Lou Girodo.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.940 align:middle line:84%
He was in the district
attorney's office in Trinidad.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:84%
He had been assigned to
investigate animal mutilations.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was Lou Girodo who said,
all the investigators and I--

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.190 align:middle line:84%
we are convinced we're
dealing with creatures not

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:84%
from this planet and
then explained why.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And that is how the film
"A Strange Harvest" that

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.760 align:middle line:84%
received an Emmy--
and it was like a bomb

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.250 align:middle line:90%
went off when it was broadcast.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.130 align:middle line:84%
That was what pulled
the focus of all

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.790 align:middle line:84%
of the off-the-record comments--
was Lou Girodo telling

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:33.070 align:middle line:84%
the truth that we were dealing
with a technology that was not

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.017 align:middle line:90%
human.

00:05:34.017 --> 00:05:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>> And it wasn't so much--

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.615 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's interesting,
because oftentimes the cattle

00:05:37.615 --> 00:05:40.040 align:middle line:84%
mutilation comes
up, and people are--

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.840 align:middle line:90%
oh, my God.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.250 align:middle line:90%
These beings are barbaric.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Look.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And then I think of
"Fast Food Nation"

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.860 align:middle line:84%
and what we do to so
many animals every day.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.070 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that it's done
in such a mysterious fashion,

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.920 align:middle line:84%
that it's really an indication
something else is happening.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not so much the barbarism
involved as it is the anomaly.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And I can underscore what
you're saying with one example.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Several times veterinarians
have been called into a field

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.430 align:middle line:90%
to do a necropsy by a sheriff.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And one of those was in
Sterling, Colorado in the '70s.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And when the veterinarian
opened up this mutilated cow,

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.860 align:middle line:90%
there was no heart.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.910 align:middle line:84%
There was no blood inside of the
perfectly intact pericardium--

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.000 align:middle line:84%
that clear membrane that
goes around your heart

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.620 align:middle line:90%
or enforces a heart.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just that is what
goes around hearts.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And for the veterinarian
to find this

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:39.100 align:middle line:84%
is the size of a full-grown
cow's heart-- it's huge.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.240 align:middle line:84%
No tissue, no clotted
blood, no fluid.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said there was a half
teaspoon of something that

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.970 align:middle line:84%
was sort of clear and
pink, and that was it

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.430 align:middle line:90%
in that entire pericardium.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.550 align:middle line:90%
And the sheriff, Tex Graves--

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.110 align:middle line:84%
he said, that veterinarian
looked at me and said,

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.070 align:middle line:84%
don't you ever call me out
on another one of these.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.240 align:middle line:84%
I am not going to stand
up in front of reporters

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.520 align:middle line:84%
and tell them I have no idea
how anyone would do this.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.390 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.210 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that's
been documented for a while--

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Betty and Barney Hill,
which is a fascinating case,

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.170 align:middle line:84%
because it was
actually-- they went

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.380 align:middle line:90%
through regression therapy.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.930 align:middle line:84%
They went through
hypnosis, essentially--

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>> With an expert.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>> --with an expert to
bring this information back

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.050 align:middle line:90%
as to their abduction.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And the common themes throughout
the abductions from that time

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.610 align:middle line:84%
forward-- from
1961 forward are--

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:34.570 align:middle line:90%
you tell us.

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.150 align:middle line:84%
I know there are certain types
of beings, certain pictures,

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.610 align:middle line:90%
and so forth that take place.

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Over-- if you took '61 as
the beginning point of Betty

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and Barney Hill in what
was not then even a--

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.520 align:middle line:90%
it didn't even have a name--

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.090 align:middle line:84%
was that this couple was
reporting strange events,

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.280 align:middle line:90%
and they got home late.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And now, as we talk in 2007
with the 40-some years,

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.250 align:middle line:84%
the name that got put
on this syndrome--

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.830 align:middle line:84%
because so many hundreds,
if not thousands,

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.560 align:middle line:84%
of people around the world
were reporting the same kind

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.880 align:middle line:90%
of events--

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.830 align:middle line:84%
was the human
abduction syndrome.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was called
syndrome, because there

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.260 align:middle line:90%
were various categories.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.770 align:middle line:84%
There would be people asleep at
night, and then they're waked.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And they can be
waked into paralysis,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.160 align:middle line:84%
meaning they know that they're
conscious, but they can't move.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Or they awake, and they can
move, and what they're seeing

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.970 align:middle line:90%
are these--

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:38.890 align:middle line:84%
the 3 foot-- grayish
with the big black eyes.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.326 align:middle line:84%
And then there is
usually a panoply

00:08:42.326 --> 00:08:44.200 align:middle line:84%
of different descriptions
that either they're

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.100 align:middle line:84%
conscious of being moved in the
air out of their house, move

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.640 align:middle line:84%
through windows out of
their house or their room,

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.040 align:middle line:90%
lifted out of cars.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Many people describe seeing
some part of their second body

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.390 align:middle line:84%
go through car windows, and
then they're into an abduction.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.300 align:middle line:84%
One case-- the
woman said, I know

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.910 align:middle line:84%
that I looked at my speedometer,
because I was worried

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:11.950 align:middle line:84%
about speeding, and I know that
the speedometer said it was 65,

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.350 align:middle line:90%
and then it blurred.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And then it went--
the needle went.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.990 align:middle line:90%
I was doing 40.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:23.860 align:middle line:84%
She said, how could I be
looking at my speedometer at 65

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.110 align:middle line:90%
and then it's 40?

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.940 align:middle line:90%
That was her only clue.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:30.940 align:middle line:90%
It haunted her.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Something had
happened on the road.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And that shows that
whether it is something

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:40.150 align:middle line:84%
that is aggressive and up-front
in your face in your bedroom,

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:44.620 align:middle line:84%
or as subtle as a needle on
a speedometer that changes

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:49.900 align:middle line:84%
in front of your eyes, that the
common denominator is everybody

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.070 align:middle line:84%
gets to some place that
they're headed, either too late

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and they know that
they had missing time,

00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:00.190 align:middle line:84%
or from the bedrooms, they
know that they wake up,

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and they don't
know what happened.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
people like Jim

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Sparks that I think is one of
the more important abduction

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.980 align:middle line:84%
cases, in which
for approximately

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:15.550 align:middle line:84%
13 years over a
span, he was taken

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:19.600 align:middle line:84%
on a regular basis
totally conscious.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.540 align:middle line:84%
It was as if the intent
of the non-humans

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:28.300 align:middle line:84%
was to keep him conscious and
to go through, essentially,

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:33.160 align:middle line:84%
a school to learn
non-human symbols.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And what is so
intriguing to me after--

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.530 align:middle line:84%
28 years ago I started trying
to get to the bottom of animal

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:44.470 align:middle line:84%
mutilations that took me
through law enforcement,

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.350 align:middle line:84%
to the concept that
creatures from outer space

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:50.200 align:middle line:84%
were doing the mutilations,
and then realizing

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.600 align:middle line:84%
that the human abduction
syndrome was linked

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.370 align:middle line:84%
to some sort of interaction with
non-humans, to crop formations,

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:58.270 align:middle line:90%
to it all.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And that after 28 years,
it is like a pointillism

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:10.360 align:middle line:84%
painting from France in
which there are 2,000 dots.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you stand back
from those 2,000 dots,

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.670 align:middle line:90%
you have kind of a pattern.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.310 align:middle line:84%
But if you go to every
single dot, which

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:23.140 align:middle line:84%
is every individual case,
you do not have truth.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:30.070 align:middle line:84%
You have experiences in
which something much bigger

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:37.180 align:middle line:84%
is doing a very large
interaction with human beings,

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:42.410 align:middle line:84%
leaving human beings
without answers.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And as an
investigative reporter,

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.120 align:middle line:84%
looking at this
bigger picture, you

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.720 align:middle line:84%
realize that whatever
it is, it does not

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.370 align:middle line:84%
want us to understand
what it is doing.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And right now in 2007,
what I intuitively sense

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:05.200 align:middle line:84%
is that perhaps the gear is
shifting again, where there

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.970 align:middle line:90%
are too many frustrated people.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:09.580 align:middle line:84%
There are too many
angry military people.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.430 align:middle line:84%
They know we're dealing with
non-human entities that break

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.460 align:middle line:90%
down into several categories.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that governments,
whether for good reasons

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.390 align:middle line:84%
or bad reasons, have chosen
to have policies of denial

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.640 align:middle line:84%
in the interests of
national security,

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.910 align:middle line:84%
to keep this entirely away from
the taxpayers, from the media,

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:36.050 align:middle line:84%
from everyone in the long
run is a huge mistake.

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.410 align:middle line:84%
I think everybody is
beginning to realize

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.770 align:middle line:84%
you can't build and
sustain a planet that

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:46.300 align:middle line:84%
is lying about something that is
interacting with the citizenry

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:50.490 align:middle line:84%
and keep that lie going
to perpetuate-- what?

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:53.440 align:middle line:84%
To perpetuate the
greed/power syndrome,

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.520 align:middle line:84%
so that the stock
market doesn't collapse.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>> To project energy sources
from new technologies being

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:00.850 align:middle line:90%
introduced.

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>> All of this is now at a
point where there's a sense that

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.690 align:middle line:90%
there has to be a seismic event.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Something has to now
affect this whole planet

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.600 align:middle line:84%
to allow the release, just
like the San Andreas Fault

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.300 align:middle line:84%
that has been pushing with
so many lies for so long,

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.540 align:middle line:90%
and that it has to release.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And it may be unpleasant
for some people,

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.690 align:middle line:84%
but I think that we've
reached a point of what

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.730 align:middle line:90%
some people call tough love.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:35.890 align:middle line:84%
The planet-- every human
deserves the same facts

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:39.190 align:middle line:84%
and information that the
power/greed people have.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.740 align:middle line:84%
To have it otherwise
is for us to continue

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.320 align:middle line:84%
to live on a planet that is
going to become more and more

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.820 align:middle line:84%
disconnected, more
and more master-slave,

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:53.020 align:middle line:84%
and an illusion of which
we're perpetuating mythology.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.690 align:middle line:84%
We're not dealing with the
reality of the universe.

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And how are we ever going
to expand from this Earth,

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.920 align:middle line:84%
whether we go to Mars
or beyond, and still

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.400 align:middle line:84%
keep insisting to
this planet that this

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.735 align:middle line:84%
is the only planet in this
vast universe that has--

00:14:08.735 --> 00:14:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>> With intelligent--

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>> --life?

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>> --life.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's the only
insanity, really,

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.630 align:middle line:84%
is that anyone thinks
that that could still even

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.340 align:middle line:90%
be a possibility.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.710 align:middle line:90%
So most people are savvy.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.850 align:middle line:84%
When they do these various
polls here and there,

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.940 align:middle line:84%
it shows that certainly
the majority of people

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.920 align:middle line:84%
think we are not the
only intelligent life

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.330 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Yet, as you say, this
power/greed structure

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.940 align:middle line:84%
that's holding everything
down has a firm grip on us.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.262 align:middle line:90%
How do you see that cracking?

00:14:39.262 --> 00:14:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all,
off camera, you

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.730 align:middle line:84%
told me something I
found very interesting.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Earthfiles.com-- your site--
you actually have subscribers

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.700 align:middle line:90%
from Congress, right?

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:48.741 align:middle line:90%
>> Right-- in Washington.

00:14:48.741 --> 00:14:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you talk about where
you're seeing the cracks?

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's been both
reinforcing and encouraging

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:59.410 align:middle line:84%
that when I look at how the
subscriber base to my news

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:02.620 align:middle line:84%
website earthfiles.com
has expanded,

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.680 align:middle line:84%
that I realize that there
are subscriptions from

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.910 align:middle line:90%
congressional offices.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:12.040 align:middle line:84%
There are subscriptions from
all kinds of professional people

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:90%
from engineering to astronomy.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And that means that
they may be signing up

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.695 align:middle line:84%
for the pure science and
the pure environment reports

00:15:20.695 --> 00:15:24.280 align:middle line:84%
at Earthfiles, which there
are considerable numbers.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:28.210 align:middle line:84%
But it means also that
there's a high likelihood

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:31.780 align:middle line:84%
that they want to read
the real X files, which

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:35.620 align:middle line:84%
is focused around these subjects
of human abductions, animal

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:39.002 align:middle line:90%
mutilations, crop formations.

00:15:39.002 --> 00:15:41.370 align:middle line:90%
There's a whole panoply--

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.810 align:middle line:90%
orbs, mysterious plasmas.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.480 align:middle line:84%
There is so much that is there,
and can be physically measured,

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.166 align:middle line:90%
and it's not understood.

00:15:49.166 --> 00:15:52.390 align:middle line:90%


00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:56.200 align:middle line:84%
To realize that-- for
perhaps the first time

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.770 align:middle line:84%
in my professional life
where working inside

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:05.980 align:middle line:84%
of television stations, I had to
do what management would allow.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And then when I decide
independently to start a news

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:13.330 align:middle line:84%
website, because of
the wonderful internet,

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and that I can then focus on
what I think is important,

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:20.650 align:middle line:84%
using still journalistic
rules about-- let's

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.200 align:middle line:84%
have some eyewitnesses and
try to get physical evidence.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.660 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless,
stories that fall

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:29.080 align:middle line:84%
into the politically
unacceptable category

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.520 align:middle line:84%
in many cases, and then
finding that there are so

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:39.310 align:middle line:84%
many professional people who are
contacting me to either report

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:42.490 align:middle line:84%
off the record their
own experiences,

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.720 align:middle line:84%
their own firsthand knowledge
with the government,

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.690 align:middle line:84%
with military, with science,
and in some cases agreeing

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.770 align:middle line:90%
to go on the record.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:52.945 align:middle line:90%
This is a--

00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:55.600 align:middle line:90%
I think a sign of hope.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.820 align:middle line:84%
There is great frustration
in the military.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.390 align:middle line:84%
There is great
frustration by scientists,

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:04.780 align:middle line:84%
by bureaucrats, all
feeling that we are now

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:10.599 align:middle line:84%
living in a country that
has become a straitjacket,

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:11.569 align:middle line:90%
and they hate it.

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:12.369 align:middle line:90%
We--

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>> That's good to hear--

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>> --all do.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>> --that.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.349 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we know we do,
and everybody here does.

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:20.470 align:middle line:84%
But I keep receiving the
same word increasingly,

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.990 align:middle line:84%
whether it's military,
Pentagon, CIA.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.365 align:middle line:84%
There are many people that
are very-- beyond frustrated--

00:17:25.365 --> 00:17:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>> --are really desperate to
start changing the system from

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.030 align:middle line:84%
within, and they're
in positions of power.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:34.660 align:middle line:84%
How do you break an
egg that has become

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:39.580 align:middle line:84%
this strange, fascist nation
pretending to be a democracy?

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.800 align:middle line:84%
How do you break
it and put it back

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.730 align:middle line:84%
together again into anything
that would be recognizable

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:49.350 align:middle line:84%
and wanted by the very
people who still live here,

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.260 align:middle line:90%
who know everything is wrong?

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.970 align:middle line:90%
So when you look at this--

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.100 align:middle line:84%
as you say, it's kind of
a pointillistic painting,

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.350 align:middle line:84%
and you take these dots, and
you start connecting them

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:02.440 align:middle line:90%
into a portrait or a mosaic.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.180 align:middle line:84%
What are you starting
to see emerging

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:07.434 align:middle line:84%
from all of this in terms
of the way forward now?

00:18:07.434 --> 00:18:13.370 align:middle line:90%


00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether it is going to be
a NASA government announcement

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:23.570 align:middle line:84%
that we have found
life on Mars--

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:25.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't care if it's bacteria.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:30.180 align:middle line:84%
I think they're trying
to set the stage soon,

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to
find life somewhere.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And once the
government can embrace,

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:41.360 align:middle line:84%
oh, there's life on
Mars, life in Europa,

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:46.490 align:middle line:84%
life detected in
another planet, then

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:51.170 align:middle line:84%
I think they feel like we can
open the box to other life

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:52.730 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.610 align:middle line:84%
So I keep waiting
for those headlines.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.500 align:middle line:84%
I think that our
government wants

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.190 align:middle line:84%
the discovery of other life
to come as a cushion shot

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:02.300 align:middle line:90%
through another place.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Gotcha.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, what about the
actual beings themselves?

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:09.440 align:middle line:84%
What indications are you getting
from the abductee experience

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.085 align:middle line:84%
and what you're seeing as maybe
that part of the portrait?

00:19:13.085 --> 00:19:14.600 align:middle line:90%
What are their agendas?

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.310 align:middle line:90%
How do they play into it?

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>> What makes me nervous about
the non-humans is that every

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:25.910 align:middle line:84%
single one of them seem to
choose secrecy and deception,

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:32.160 align:middle line:84%
just like our own government, to
continue their operations here.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that the non-humans,
who could so easily pull

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.630 align:middle line:84%
the rug out from under
the policies of denial,

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.120 align:middle line:84%
by our government or
any other government--

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.600 align:middle line:84%
why do they not choose to
make themselves public?

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.400 align:middle line:90%
We are here.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.580 align:middle line:84%
We do not want you
to have nuclear war.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:53.150 align:middle line:84%
We do not want you to
destroy the rainforest.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Do you not understand those
are the lungs of the planet?

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Do you not understand
that if you

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.960 align:middle line:84%
keep living the way
you are, you will not

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.540 align:middle line:90%
have any air to breathe?

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Statements like that
coming from a non-human,

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:84%
whether it's all television
sets around the world or however

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.990 align:middle line:90%
they wanted to do it--

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:17.120 align:middle line:84%
I can not imagine
anyone anywhere

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:23.000 align:middle line:84%
on this Earth panicking
if that is the true agenda

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.624 align:middle line:90%
and the true goal.

00:20:24.624 --> 00:20:25.540 align:middle line:90%
>> It would seem true.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And now, when you listen
to the work of some people,

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.580 align:middle line:84%
including Barbara Marciniak,
who's here and others,

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.410 align:middle line:84%
that you'll hear
these-- there are

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:35.780 align:middle line:84%
beings that are trying to
get this exact information

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.880 align:middle line:84%
through in a very
select kind of way.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And select makes
no sense to me.

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, instead of
public appearance, right?

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Makes them-- when anybody
talks about an elite group,

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:51.740 align:middle line:90%
they've lost me.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.110 align:middle line:90%
I just cannot understand.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:55.970 align:middle line:90%
Now, when I say lost--

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:59.980 align:middle line:84%
meaning if we're dealing
with advanced intelligences--

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.680 align:middle line:84%
one, two, or more that
are actually benevolent,

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.910 align:middle line:84%
who have actually lived long
enough to realize that war

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:12.330 align:middle line:84%
of any kind is a
no-win situation,

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.610 align:middle line:90%
and that I am expecting--

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.180 align:middle line:84%
it may be naive,
but I am expecting

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:20.840 align:middle line:84%
that advanced intelligence
would be for a win-win.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.360 align:middle line:84%
A win-win for us,
a win-win for them,

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.490 align:middle line:90%
a win-win for the universe.

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:29.510 align:middle line:84%
So when anybody says
an elite group is

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:34.880 align:middle line:84%
going to have X information,
I'm very mistrustful.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
the non-humans seem

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:42.050 align:middle line:84%
to choose a certain kind
of secrecy and deception

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:46.340 align:middle line:84%
for their own side
makes me wonder,

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.620 align:middle line:84%
what could their
agendas really, truly

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.290 align:middle line:84%
be that they are
choosing also, secrecy,

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:53.300 align:middle line:90%
and illusion, and manipulation?

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what about like
Barbara, like Billy Meier,

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:57.890 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:00.860 align:middle line:84%
These kinds of examples that are
trying to get information out

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:07.067 align:middle line:84%
there into the world that have
been contacted as they state.

00:22:07.067 --> 00:22:08.900 align:middle line:84%
They've been contacted,
and this information

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.020 align:middle line:84%
has been flowing through
for a number of years.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.810 align:middle line:84%
What about that scenario where
it's really to go to the many?

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:17.890 align:middle line:90%


00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look at the human
abduction syndrome or contact,

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.060 align:middle line:90%
there's a slight difference.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Historically in the beginning,
there were people like Adamski,

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:30.430 align:middle line:84%
leading up to Billy
Meier, who said

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:34.170 align:middle line:84%
that these beings would
land, and talk with them,

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:37.620 align:middle line:90%
or telepath to them.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:40.240 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of, I guess, in
the Walter Mitty fantasy

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.170 align:middle line:90%
that humans have.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't we all like to
sit down on a sunny day

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:49.150 align:middle line:84%
and have extraterrestrials
around us

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:51.070 align:middle line:90%
tell us about the universe?

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.476 align:middle line:90%
I would love it.

00:22:52.476 --> 00:22:54.850 align:middle line:84%
But everybody in
the military says

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:59.230 align:middle line:84%
that that is a complete
and total fantasy.

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:03.400 align:middle line:84%
That we are dealing with
minds, and beings, and entities

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:08.380 align:middle line:84%
that are so foreign, alien,
different than Homo sapiens.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.020 align:middle line:84%
That their telepathic
mental powers

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:14.140 align:middle line:90%
are overwhelming to our minds.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.540 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter whether
they're military intel

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.659 align:middle line:90%
and prepared for an interaction.

00:23:18.659 --> 00:23:20.950 align:middle line:84%
I've talked with two men who
said they were completely,

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.620 align:middle line:84%
physically disabled
after simply trying

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:27.280 align:middle line:84%
to take a telepathic
inload, while the being was

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.460 align:middle line:90%
taking a telepathic upload.

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.530 align:middle line:90%
They physically collapsed.

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And that may be why the
abductees in all these years

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:39.490 align:middle line:90%
have been sort of protected.

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:41.920 align:middle line:90%
Paralysis might be protection.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.650 align:middle line:84%
The complete amnesia and missing
time is a kind of protection.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:51.310 align:middle line:84%
It may be that the aliens' acts
of compassion are the human

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:52.365 align:middle line:90%
traumas if it's--

00:23:52.365 --> 00:23:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I've
wondered about that.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>> --total misunderstanding.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I've wondered
if that's possible,

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.110 align:middle line:84%
because I've heard and read
through the years that it can

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:01.240 align:middle line:90%
be with animal mutilations.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.980 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
Dolores Cannon's work,

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.860 align:middle line:84%
that oftentimes they're
looking to analyze

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.020 align:middle line:84%
the contents of the
organs of the body

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:12.200 align:middle line:84%
to see what's happening in
our ecosystems and so forth.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And that, actually, may be
even preparing some other place

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:19.630 align:middle line:84%
with DNA seed and
on, and on, and on.

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>> But you were asking, though.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.470 align:middle line:90%
It's an important question.

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.565 align:middle line:84%
What about the Billy
Meiers and those

00:24:24.565 --> 00:24:27.760 align:middle line:84%
that fall more into a
category of contact?

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's the problem.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Every single one,
as far as I know,

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:37.600 align:middle line:84%
of the people who have been
sort of public, out front with--

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.260 align:middle line:84%
I have communicated
with non-human beings--

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:45.380 align:middle line:84%
and in Billy Meier and Adamski's
case, they were the Blondes.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Other people have had
their own descriptions,

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.550 align:middle line:90%
but what happened?

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of them
was attacked, so thoroughly

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.540 align:middle line:90%
shredded as being--

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>> --non-credible.

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:03.220 align:middle line:84%
That if you bring up the
contactees individually or as

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:07.210 align:middle line:84%
a group, they're the ones that
receive the most derision.

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Is that because they scared
our government the most?

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Humans that were willing
to stand up and say

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:20.290 align:middle line:84%
that these Blonde non-humans
came and telepathed to me,

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:23.800 align:middle line:84%
or took me onto a craft,
and took me out, and here

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.680 align:middle line:90%
are the photographs.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.285 align:middle line:84%
That would have been so
threatening to the policy

00:25:28.285 --> 00:25:30.535 align:middle line:84%
of denial in the interests
of national security, which

00:25:30.535 --> 00:25:33.220 align:middle line:84%
is, I understand, goes all
the way back to Franklin

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Delano Roosevelt. 1941 was
the first crash retrieval

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.680 align:middle line:84%
that I know about
in Missouri, and we

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.720 align:middle line:84%
got technology that
was applied to what

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.410 align:middle line:84%
became the Manhattan Project
and the development of the bomb.

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:49.960 align:middle line:90%
And you juxtapose that.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:55.180 align:middle line:84%
You juxtapose the biggest,
darkest, deepest secrets

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:59.300 align:middle line:84%
of what was considered to be the
dominant nation of the planet,

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:06.940 align:middle line:84%
then the United States, against
roly-poly citizens who can just

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.420 align:middle line:84%
go out into their backyard,
and extraterrestrials

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.630 align:middle line:84%
will come, and talk to them,
and take them on craft.

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, that must have
made a lot of the--

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:21.400 align:middle line:84%
we'll call them authoritarians
in the government-- just cringe

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.780 align:middle line:90%
and run for the exits.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.570 align:middle line:84%
They would not want that
to-- what would be--

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:29.920 align:middle line:84%
the design would be anybody
who comes forward and says

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.550 align:middle line:84%
that they have had a Blonde
or something come up to them--

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:35.449 align:middle line:84%
they're going to get
the full press duration.

00:26:35.449 --> 00:26:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>> You'll be
discredited immediately.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Completely.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:43.180 align:middle line:84%
So that leaves, then, the
human abduction syndrome,

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.460 align:middle line:84%
which shifts CD
track a little bit

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:50.780 align:middle line:84%
from the out front, sitting
in some kind of communication,

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:52.990 align:middle line:90%
and it's more frightening.

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Something appears in your
bedroom in the night,

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:56.650 align:middle line:90%
and then you're paralyzed.

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:58.280 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.450 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, the government
is more in control.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:04.990 align:middle line:84%
It means now the human
abduction syndrome is not

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:07.690 align:middle line:84%
quite so threatening to
the government's policy,

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:09.742 align:middle line:90%
because people are afraid.

00:27:09.742 --> 00:27:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And because people
are afraid, they

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.375 align:middle line:90%
don't want to talk about it.

00:27:12.375 --> 00:27:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And if something
happens, they're

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:14.874 align:middle line:90%
not going to talk about it.

00:27:14.874 --> 00:27:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, whether
they did it by design,

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.490 align:middle line:84%
or it happened out of
a fluke, the government

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:25.440 align:middle line:90%
is now back in control by fear.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And that is the way
they have been operating

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.460 align:middle line:84%
to keep all of this
from the public

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.980 align:middle line:84%
and the media for
at least 60 years.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:36.640 align:middle line:90%


00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And I mean,
even Steven Greer--

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:41.620 align:middle line:90%
we've had two Disclosures now.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:45.106 align:middle line:84%
We had one in 2001, and then
we had with Steven Greer

00:27:45.106 --> 00:27:46.230 align:middle line:90%
at the National Press Club.

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Then we had one very recently at
the National Press Club again,

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:50.770 align:middle line:90%
some of the same players, even.

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Still it's not getting out there
to the public as it should.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:59.604 align:middle line:84%
Steven Greer himself also
talks about the Blondes

00:27:59.604 --> 00:28:01.020 align:middle line:84%
that he's been
communicating with.

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.686 align:middle line:84%
They gave him a lot
of that information,

00:28:02.686 --> 00:28:06.760 align:middle line:84%
so he'd know where to even
begin on a lot of the research.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.730 align:middle line:84%
What's it going to-- what's
it actually going to take?

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:10.630 align:middle line:90%
I was at Disclosure.

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:14.470 align:middle line:84%
When you see old men
with their medals on,

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:17.380 align:middle line:84%
standing up there,
shaking, and even in tears,

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.200 align:middle line:84%
because of breaking
their national security

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.330 align:middle line:84%
oath to risk this, and
we still don't listen.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:23.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not even put out there.

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:25.313 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know the
media is controlled,

00:28:25.313 --> 00:28:27.770 align:middle line:90%
so what is it going to take?

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>> What is it going to take to
break up in this vast, vast,

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:35.440 align:middle line:84%
cemented secret about non-humans
interacting with our planet

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.150 align:middle line:90%
for millennia?

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:41.660 align:middle line:84%
That is a question that I have
on my own mind all the time

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.740 align:middle line:84%
and wonder if I will
ever know in my lifetime.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Or will the next generation
know in their lifetime,

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:51.670 align:middle line:84%
that this perpetuation of this
kind of lie and suppression,

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:54.670 align:middle line:84%
could be on the--
we'll call them

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:57.580 align:middle line:90%
the masterminds of Majestic 12.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Their entire goal could be to
get through this generation

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:06.110 align:middle line:84%
and yet, another generation
before any truth comes out.

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:09.710 align:middle line:90%
But what will it take?

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I think that, ultimately,
for any successful shift

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:18.840 align:middle line:84%
in a paradigm as
huge as this one is,

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:24.180 align:middle line:84%
because governments have
worked over time for decades

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.190 align:middle line:90%
to keep this as--

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.330 align:middle line:84%
there is nothing else
in the universe but us.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Remember that.

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:33.180 align:middle line:84%
The governments have
been the manipulators

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:36.320 align:middle line:84%
to keep the public and
the media from the truths

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.240 align:middle line:84%
that they have been
trying to bury.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So in order to have a
successful paradigm shift,

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.400 align:middle line:84%
it has to be
politically acceptable.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.920 align:middle line:90%
And the way this planet works--

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:56.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly why, but
humans seem to move in packs.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:59.220 align:middle line:84%
You have to have somebody who
stands up with credibility

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:03.750 align:middle line:84%
and says, we're now going
to give you another truth.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:07.020 align:middle line:84%
We have kept this from you
all these years, because we

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.700 align:middle line:90%
were trying to protect you.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.180 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to get to
a point where we were

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.820 align:middle line:90%
in control of the situation.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.660 align:middle line:84%
We can stand in front of
you today and say we are.

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:20.400 align:middle line:90%
There is no threat.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're going
to tell you what

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.080 align:middle line:84%
we have been learning
for the last 60 years

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.370 align:middle line:84%
about our planet for
the last billion years.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:34.080 align:middle line:84%
If it comes as a shock to
some of you, we apologize.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:38.700 align:middle line:84%
But governments stand
to protect the majority,

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.190 align:middle line:90%
and that is what we have done.

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:44.310 align:middle line:84%
I would expect that
if they did that,

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:49.650 align:middle line:84%
and they brought a non-human
Blonde, Grey, whatever, or two,

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:53.910 align:middle line:84%
or three of them into
a press conference,

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and the press would
obviously have to know,

00:30:56.310 --> 00:31:01.540 align:middle line:84%
and there would be
millions of reporters,

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:08.930 align:middle line:84%
that is the kind of
event globally broadcast.

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:10.540 align:middle line:84%
The humans are
standing right there

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.420 align:middle line:84%
with what looks like a standing
up alligator, and a Blonde,

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and a Grey, and
everything is fine.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:18.520 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's hurting.

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:22.270 align:middle line:84%
In a funny way, by now, that's
about all it would take.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that the
governments don't do it--

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:27.670 align:middle line:90%
what's the question in my mind?

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Is it because the Blondes,
the reptiles, the Greys,

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:38.410 align:middle line:84%
whatever the menagerie
is, that they don't want

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:40.640 align:middle line:90%
this to happen yet themselves?

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And if not, what
is their agenda?

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:47.140 align:middle line:84%
It may not be up
to humans at all,

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:51.190 align:middle line:84%
but our governments have
certainly maintained the lie.

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:52.900 align:middle line:84%
They are the ones
who have maintained

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:56.020 align:middle line:84%
the lie, regardless of
whether the non-humans have

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.910 align:middle line:90%
their own timeline agenda.

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think as a human
being on this planet,

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:06.760 align:middle line:84%
if I were talking to the whole
human family, I would say,

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.490 align:middle line:84%
fundamentally, I
think that is wrong.

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:12.520 align:middle line:84%
I think that every
human deserves

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:16.030 align:middle line:84%
to know what the
power/greed structure knows.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And to have a perpetuation
of an elite ability

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:25.330 align:middle line:84%
to make money off of
extraterrestrial technology,

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:30.190 align:middle line:84%
to keep secrets in which other
people are hurt and imprisoned,

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:35.280 align:middle line:84%
because of extraterrestrial
knowledge is a crime--

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.390 align:middle line:90%
a fundamental crime.

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And one man who talked
to me in the '80s--

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:43.110 align:middle line:84%
he had worked in the
Central Intelligence Agency.

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:45.100 align:middle line:90%
He's no longer alive.

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.430 align:middle line:84%
He said, Linda, I can
tell you this as a fact.

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:50.620 align:middle line:84%
There's not a person
who's been involved

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:54.940 align:middle line:84%
in the ongoing study of
the extraterrestrials

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.370 align:middle line:84%
on this planet and
has been involved

00:32:57.370 --> 00:33:00.640 align:middle line:84%
in policy-making who
wants to be alive

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.429 align:middle line:90%
when this story comes out.

00:33:03.429 --> 00:33:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>> That not a one of
them want to be alive?

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>> They do not want to be alive
when this story comes out,

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.237 align:middle line:84%
because they have committed
so many fundamental crimes.

00:33:12.237 --> 00:33:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see what you're saying.

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:14.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:15.250 align:middle line:90%
That's why.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>> They know they have
committed crimes--

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:20.920 align:middle line:84%
crimes against all of
humanity for heaven's sake.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a very
interesting statement.

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:23.500 align:middle line:90%
>> That's where we stand.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>> That's where we stand.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So those of us who are
the lonely mavericks--

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:36.010 align:middle line:84%
there is a certain
gentle satisfaction

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:39.740 align:middle line:84%
that in 2007, we're
even beginning

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:43.550 align:middle line:84%
to have dialogues and hear
about this on "Larry King."

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:46.130 align:middle line:84%
The press conference
with the pilots--

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:49.460 align:middle line:84%
it's very important that
the pilots be the one,

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.640 align:middle line:90%
I think, on "Larry King."

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.650 align:middle line:90%
I hope they have more.

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:59.690 align:middle line:90%
The airline and military world--

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:03.250 align:middle line:90%
they know in spades.

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And they've all been
threatened, and intimidated,

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:07.340 align:middle line:90%
and they couldn't talk.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, there
is a quiet movement

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:14.690 align:middle line:84%
started by Jim Sparks,
a human abduction

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:17.750 align:middle line:84%
guy, who had a lot
of interactions,

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:20.540 align:middle line:84%
actually, with people in
the government on a QT.

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And he thinks that there
should be a congressional act

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:29.540 align:middle line:84%
to give immunity to all
those, who have signed

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:32.989 align:middle line:84%
these non-disclosure agreements
about the extraterrestrials,

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:36.949 align:middle line:84%
that would put them in prison,
$50,000 fines, families

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:38.590 align:middle line:90%
would lose pensions, all of it.

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:41.270 align:middle line:84%
That it should just
be neutralized.

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:44.719 align:middle line:84%
Let the chips fall where
they may and, wham!

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Have everybody start
telling the truth.

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I would agree.

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And in an ideal world,
that would be great.

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:55.429 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think-- because
this is not an ideal world

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:58.430 align:middle line:84%
and politics,
unfortunately, dominates,

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
that's going to happen.

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:06.080 align:middle line:84%
But the press conference
in which government says,

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:10.776 align:middle line:84%
we've been doing all
of this to protect you.

00:35:10.776 --> 00:35:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're going
to introduce those

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:15.710 align:middle line:84%
that we understand, and
can communicate with,

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:18.650 align:middle line:90%
and you have nothing to fear.

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:21.680 align:middle line:84%
That is the press
conference that I personally

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.430 align:middle line:84%
think would sweep away
centuries and bring this

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:26.810 align:middle line:90%
all back into focus.

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
upset some folks,

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:33.440 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes just to get
truth back in balance,

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.540 align:middle line:90%
some people have to get upset.

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And I would not,
myself, personally, not

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:40.220 align:middle line:90%
have any concerns now.

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:44.270 align:middle line:84%
Because if you judge
from the teenagers--

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I have had teenagers rush
up to me at conferences,

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:51.620 align:middle line:84%
grab ahold of me, and
say, please, tell us

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:55.190 align:middle line:84%
which ones are-- and they've
already figured it out.

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:57.440 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
discs are one type,

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.030 align:middle line:90%
and we know the cylinders.

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:00.880 align:middle line:90%
And like the teenagers--

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.030 align:middle line:84%
it isn't if and are we
in a universe hidden?

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:05.810 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:09.140 align:middle line:84%
They've already grasped
there's different types,

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:12.170 align:middle line:84%
and there's different crafts,
and they talk about it.

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And they just want somebody
to fill in the details.

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think, wow, this
has happened on its own

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.620 align:middle line:90%
in another generation.

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So we can only hope that
that press conference

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.000 align:middle line:90%
does take place one day.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:26.360 align:middle line:90%
I think you're--

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>> In our--

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>> --absolutely right--

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>> --lifetime.

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>> --in our lifetime.

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And at times, it
seems it's so close.

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the opportunity
was there a few years ago.

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:35.930 align:middle line:90%
It was there the other day.

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:39.810 align:middle line:84%
It's there all the time having
the-- even CNN covered this.

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:40.610 align:middle line:90%
Maybe--

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And they did not
do it with sarcasm.

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>> --no, they didn't do
it with sarcasm this time.

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we're
approaching that time.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And then all the
work you've done--

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:50.270 align:middle line:84%
you must have been subjected
to a large amount of ridicule

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:51.540 align:middle line:90%
through the years.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.349 align:middle line:90%
>> Well--

00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I know you're credible
in your research,

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:56.490 align:middle line:84%
but just from people who
just cannot deal with it.

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>> --I don't know that
I've been ridiculed.

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the funny
thing about all this

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:05.210 align:middle line:84%
was by the time I started
on a "Strange Harvest,"

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:07.600 align:middle line:84%
I'd already had a
national Emmy nomination,

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:12.900 align:middle line:84%
had won several Emmys,
and all of these.

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:17.690 align:middle line:84%
I was in that category of highly
credible documentary filmmaker

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:20.930 align:middle line:84%
and TV producer, which
maybe this is the universe's

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:23.060 align:middle line:90%
way of playing this out.

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So when I did a
"Strange Harvest,"

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm the same reporter.

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:32.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm the same producer who
did all of this other work.

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:36.080 align:middle line:90%
I was not really attacked.

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.100 align:middle line:90%
It was the opposite.

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:40.640 align:middle line:84%
It was like an explosion
of the world coming at me

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.920 align:middle line:90%
with all of their reports.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So then that was like another
wave that carries forward.

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:52.970 align:middle line:84%
But what I began to
realize, as strong

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:58.550 align:middle line:84%
as the physical body of evidence
was in my own work and others

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:02.690 align:middle line:84%
that I would need,
if the world is not

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:05.850 align:middle line:84%
ready to go to that
paradigm shift,

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:07.760 align:middle line:84%
if you go to the
top of buildings,

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:13.400 align:middle line:84%
and the top of mountains, and
you say, here's the truth,

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.200 align:middle line:90%
you will be stoned.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.770 align:middle line:90%


00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I took the
philosophical position, OK?

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:25.750 align:middle line:84%
I am like a dripping
water in a cave.

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:27.900 align:middle line:84%
I look at my work
over these years

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:30.480 align:middle line:84%
of making stalactites
and stalagmites,

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.150 align:middle line:90%
and I've now made many of them.

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And the cave is now
beginning to glitter.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.330 align:middle line:90%
There is light in there.

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:42.960 align:middle line:84%
If you take Earthfiles, there
are now almost 2,000 reports

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.050 align:middle line:90%
with about 15,000 images--

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>> That's amazing.

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>> --and documents.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's becoming
an encyclopedia.

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And I have people
telling me now,

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:53.310 align:middle line:90%
I use your website constantly.

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:56.400 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter-- science,
environment, or real X files

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.410 align:middle line:90%
as an encyclopedia.

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And then there are the
books, and the videos,

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:04.620 align:middle line:84%
and television, and
the constant radio.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is my little dripping
piece of fact, building

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:13.290 align:middle line:90%
these stalactites, stalagmites.

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And to see that it's
beginning to come into focus

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:19.530 align:middle line:90%
in many people's minds--

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:24.270 align:middle line:84%
this is solid work, meaning
there is documentation.

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:25.395 align:middle line:90%
There is physical evidence.

00:39:25.395 --> 00:39:25.650 align:middle line:90%
There are--

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>> And you have an incredible--

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>> --real live witnesses.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:27.720 align:middle line:90%
>> --reputation.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Among anybody that knows
anything about this work,

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:31.680 align:middle line:84%
you have an
incredible reputation.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>> And that is wonderful.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Because now, I'm
beginning to realize

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:39.090 align:middle line:84%
that whatever does
happen, that people

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:40.410 align:middle line:90%
are going to go to Earthfiles.

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:42.000 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
go to those books,

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.798 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to say,
my God, all of this--

00:39:46.798 --> 00:39:48.250 align:middle line:90%
it's true.

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>> It's true.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And thanks to yourself
and people like you,

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:54.310 align:middle line:84%
I think we're moving
closer to that day

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:56.624 align:middle line:90%
than were you not on the planet.

00:39:56.624 --> 00:39:57.578 align:middle line:90%
>> I hope so.

00:39:57.578 --> 00:39:59.486 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much
for your time, Linda.

00:39:59.486 --> 00:40:00.917 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:40:00.917 --> 00:40:03.780 align:middle line:90%


00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.030 align:middle line:84%
