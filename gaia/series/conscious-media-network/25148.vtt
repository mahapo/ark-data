00:00:12.222 --> 00:00:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Graham Nicholls was one of
those young children who saw

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.680 align:middle line:90%
strangers--

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.660 align:middle line:84%
strangers who were
invisible to others--

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.600 align:middle line:84%
standing at the foot of his bed
as he went to sleep at night.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Initially frightened by
these experiences, over time

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.880 align:middle line:84%
the opening that occurred
in his psyche began

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.420 align:middle line:84%
showing him future events,
including the London bombings.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.119 align:middle line:84%
Through his ability to
see beyond time and space,

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Graham learned to see
the interconnectedness

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.290 align:middle line:90%
and love in all things.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Along with taking part in the
psychic experiments conducted

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.810 align:middle line:84%
by the esteemed biologist
Rupert Sheldrake,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Graham documented
his experiences

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.190 align:middle line:84%
in his book titled "Avenues
of the Human Spirit."

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.600 align:middle line:84%
So here we are in
central London.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.755 align:middle line:90%
It's a busy day, weekday here.

00:00:52.755 --> 00:00:54.380 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
construction going on.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.790 align:middle line:90%
So I'm just saying that.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.140 align:middle line:90%
If anybody hears some--

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.262 align:middle line:84%
well, I hear a buzz
saw and a hammer--

00:01:00.262 --> 00:01:01.970 align:middle line:84%
just let it blend in
with the background.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.990 align:middle line:84%
So that said, you've had a
really different kind of life

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.870 align:middle line:84%
from the perspective of
the average person in that

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:15.800 align:middle line:84%
from a very early age, you were
able to see into other areas

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.570 align:middle line:90%
or other dimensions, realms.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you have your
own way of explaining that

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.680 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you can
give us an idea

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.670 align:middle line:84%
of what started happening
at a very early age for you.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the first experience
that ever happened was when I

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.640 align:middle line:90%
was about five to seven.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm not exactly
sure how old I was.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.270 align:middle line:84%
But I was living in
an apartment block.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And I came out of my bedroom
just to go to the toilet

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.560 align:middle line:84%
or whatever as you do during the
night, walked into the hallway,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.030 align:middle line:84%
and there was a figure
standing in the doorway that

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.927 align:middle line:84%
led out into the landing to
get out of the apartment.

00:01:53.927 --> 00:01:55.760 align:middle line:84%
So there was this figure
just standing there

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.660 align:middle line:90%
staring straight at me.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And I obviously was
very surprised by this

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.690 align:middle line:90%
and completely overwhelmed.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.760 align:middle line:90%
I just was terrified really.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And I dropped to
the ground I think

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.380 align:middle line:84%
to try and get some sense of
something solid from the floor.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.640 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to feel
like this was real.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And that was something not what
I would usually experience.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.510 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to get this
sense of normality back.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Then I tried to call
out to my parents.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was so frightened, I
couldn't even make any sound.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.520 align:middle line:84%
I was just almost frozen
by the experience.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
it just kind of ended.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember the real
details of the whole thing

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.150 align:middle line:90%
because I was so young.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.660 align:middle line:84%
But that was the thing that
really opened the whole process

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.460 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you feel different
after this experience?

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>> It seemed to open me
up to a sense that yeah,

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.460 align:middle line:90%
that there was more around.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And when I was at school
and around other kids,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.860 align:middle line:84%
I had this sense that
what I understood

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.620 align:middle line:84%
was different to what they were
understanding about the world.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.510 align:middle line:90%
And religion, for example.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Some of the children
didn't seem to make sense

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.930 align:middle line:84%
to me because I was starting
to be aware of other things.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.040 align:middle line:84%
I was getting
impressions as well.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.350 align:middle line:84%
I have memories of being
in my playground at school

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.080 align:middle line:84%
and just having
impressions of other places

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.675 align:middle line:84%
and even quite cosmic
things like other planets

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:37.550 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.000 align:middle line:84%
So I was just getting
these impressions coming in

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.400 align:middle line:84%
and then obviously,
that initial experience.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.600 align:middle line:84%
So the whole thing was giving
me a very different sense

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.970 align:middle line:90%
than the other kids around me.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And in your book, you were
saying that you seemed to have

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.710 align:middle line:84%
a grasp of things very easily
at a very young age that maybe

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.180 align:middle line:90%
other kids didn't as well.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even
intellectually, your mind

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.920 align:middle line:84%
was able to expand rather
rapidly at a young age.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.330 align:middle line:84%
I was finding the very
structured education system

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.940 align:middle line:90%
much too limiting.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking
into other areas

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.459 align:middle line:84%
and was much more
open to things that

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.130 align:middle line:84%
weren't within the bracket
of what I was being told

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.180 align:middle line:84%
and how I was being
told the way things are.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.830 align:middle line:84%
So it was a real
really different angle

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.000 align:middle line:90%
on the whole wave.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And then to the information
that you had to study as part

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.170 align:middle line:84%
of a matter of course in school,
those things came somewhat

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.160 align:middle line:90%
easily for you?

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Or your brain simply did
not want to go there?

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.080 align:middle line:90%


00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Certain things did and
certain things didn't.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:53.060 align:middle line:84%
I was not convinced by
some of it, like I said,

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.870 align:middle line:84%
and other things I was more
interested in, especially

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.200 align:middle line:84%
history in ancient civilizations
and things like that.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>> All things mystical were
really appealing to you.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Things that seemed to
have some connection

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.510 align:middle line:90%
to what I was experiencing.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.790 align:middle line:84%
We had one teacher
in particular who

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.910 align:middle line:84%
had traveled to
Mexico, to Egypt,

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.650 align:middle line:84%
and different places that had
a mystical flavor to them.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And he would give
us lectures on that

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.870 align:middle line:90%
even when we were very small.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And then I also
had an art teacher.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.670 align:middle line:84%
She took us to National
Gallery in central London

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and talked about the
mythology behind a lot

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.920 align:middle line:84%
of the great paintings and
great art that you see.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.850 align:middle line:84%
So there was this sense
of there being more

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.640 align:middle line:90%
to a lot of different levels.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And I was very drawn to
Greek mythology and all

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.970 align:middle line:84%
these different
mythologies that you

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:53.505 align:middle line:84%
see within these great
paintings by da Vinci

00:05:53.505 --> 00:05:55.770 align:middle line:90%
and these kinds of artists.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.120 align:middle line:84%
So I think that was something
that really drew me.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And when normally at age
six, seven, and eight,

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.023 align:middle line:90%
that wouldn't be the first draw.

00:06:02.023 --> 00:06:03.255 align:middle line:90%
But there you were.

00:06:03.255 --> 00:06:05.310 align:middle line:84%
By 12 years old,
you were actually

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.788 align:middle line:84%
starting to have experiences,
out of body experiences.

00:06:09.788 --> 00:06:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little bit
about that and what happened?

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And as we go further
along in this,

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to pick your brain as
to some of the things you saw.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, the very first out of body
experiences were very short.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.650 align:middle line:90%
They weren't the classic--

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.830 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people describe this
idea of coming out of the body

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.830 align:middle line:84%
and then looking down
at yourself from above.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.450 align:middle line:84%
My very first experience
is I was upright

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.640 align:middle line:84%
as if I was standing in
the middle of the room,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.810 align:middle line:84%
but I was floating a few
feet above the ground.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.320 align:middle line:84%
So very different to
what a lot of people

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.590 align:middle line:84%
will just describe when they
have out of body experiences.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.680 align:middle line:90%
And they were always in the way.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.150 align:middle line:90%
I was always upright.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And I had maybe two or
three of those initially.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.310 align:middle line:90%
Only lasted a few seconds.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw
something on the TV

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.990 align:middle line:84%
or read something about
how astral projection

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.000 align:middle line:84%
or out of body experiences
can be induced.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And these things can
lead you somewhere.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.990 align:middle line:84%
You can travel around
the world or you

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.280 align:middle line:84%
can explore your spirituality
through them and things

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.080 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.760 align:middle line:84%
So I then went looking
for a book on the subject.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And actually not
very far from here,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.880 align:middle line:84%
I found a book shop that had
one book by a parapsychologist

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.640 align:middle line:84%
called Janet Lee
Mitchell, which was quite

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.950 align:middle line:90%
scientific in its outlook.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:44.680 align:middle line:84%
But it had this sense that this
was a real objective thing.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.640 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the books out
there are much more

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:52.410 align:middle line:84%
dreamy or kind of
beyond the normal pale

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.650 align:middle line:90%
of what we understand.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.690 align:middle line:90%
But this book was quite solid.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.762 align:middle line:84%
So that was a good place
for me to start, in a way.

00:07:59.762 --> 00:08:00.720 align:middle line:90%
So I read through that.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And then towards the
back of the book,

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:84%
there was some really
basic techniques

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:09.730 align:middle line:84%
that were probably way
too simple in a way.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:13.030 align:middle line:84%
But I persevered with it, and
I went through these techniques

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:13.830 align:middle line:90%
for about--

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.510 align:middle line:90%
it took me about six months.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you were
really dedicated.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>> You'd lie there when most
kids are daydreaming and trying

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.643 align:middle line:84%
to go to sleep, and you
are trying to catapult out

00:08:21.643 --> 00:08:24.183 align:middle line:84%
of your body at
such a young age.

00:08:24.183 --> 00:08:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>> And I did it every night.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Every night.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.910 align:middle line:84%
I was impressed with
your persistence.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:35.850 align:middle line:90%
And then I think I was about 14.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.909 align:middle line:84%
And I had my first induced
out of body experience,

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:41.190 align:middle line:84%
which was just like
this surge of energy,

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle line:84%
almost like an electric
bolt went through my body,

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.330 align:middle line:84%
just shot out my
body above myself

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:54.600 align:middle line:84%
around 16, something like
that, looking down at myself.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
kind of bluish glow

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.600 align:middle line:84%
coming off of the
second body I was in.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And the whole room seemed
to be lit from that,

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.360 align:middle line:90%
so I could look around the room.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.555 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't move other
than kind of rotating.

00:09:09.555 --> 00:09:12.250 align:middle line:90%


00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And looking at myself
laying on the bed,

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.350 align:middle line:90%
it didn't feel like me.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:21.900 align:middle line:84%
It just felt almost
like a sculpture.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Like Madam Tussaud's
Museum of Wax Art.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I almost had
to check that it was me

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:29.490 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
really feel like I

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.310 align:middle line:84%
had much of a relationship
with the body laying there.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.880 align:middle line:84%
I just knew logically
that it must be me

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.795 align:middle line:90%
because this is my room.

00:09:38.795 --> 00:09:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>> That looks like
me lying there.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:41.310 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:46.230 align:middle line:84%
But you were actually the source
of the illumination in the room

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:47.460 align:middle line:90%
and the observer in the room.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is the holy grail
in all spiritual journeys

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.520 align:middle line:84%
that people are trying to get
to know that part of themselves

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.720 align:middle line:84%
or to understand that
part of themselves better.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And you were having some
very direct experiences.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's the
key, this directness,

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.040 align:middle line:84%
this sense of-- that's what's
really amazing about out

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.100 align:middle line:84%
of body experiences is that they
can give us this direct link

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.760 align:middle line:84%
or direct experience of
something more than ourselves.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.460 align:middle line:84%
I can't really think
of any other practice

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.050 align:middle line:84%
that you can do that can
give you that as much.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:20.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Very true.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people
do have this experience

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:27.150 align:middle line:84%
without even knowing what it
is, a feeling of disorientation.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:31.260 align:middle line:84%
I've had a few little accidental
out of body experiences.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:36.360 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one in which I ended up
flying down a flight of stairs

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.540 align:middle line:84%
and landed because I thought I
was concerned about something

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.850 align:middle line:84%
happening downstairs
with my son,

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.520 align:middle line:84%
landed upside down in
the middle of the room,

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.680 align:middle line:84%
and he was out of
his body sitting up

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.725 align:middle line:90%
watching me out of my body.

00:10:48.725 --> 00:10:50.130 align:middle line:90%
And it was all so--

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.900 align:middle line:84%
I was so embarrassed
of being upside down,

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.140 align:middle line:84%
I actually snapped myself
back into my physical body.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.180 align:middle line:90%
I thought this is bad.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.317 align:middle line:84%
I'm hanging here like
a bat upside down

00:10:59.317 --> 00:11:00.400 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the room.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.450 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And just because
I'd simply flown down

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.290 align:middle line:84%
the stairs headfirst and just
landed that way more or less.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And that wasn't a particularly
spiritual opening for me.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.390 align:middle line:84%
It was just a source of
embarrassment in that moment.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And we have silly little
things like this that happen

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.280 align:middle line:84%
or just a sense of
something being disorienting

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.710 align:middle line:84%
in a place of
patterns and color.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And that is actually
that crossover place

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.610 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of people, isn't it?

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:32.320 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a kind
of spectrum experiences.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think you've
got the more--

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.400 align:middle line:84%
just a kind of gut
feeling that you get.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.970 align:middle line:84%
That's like the beginning place
maybe, a sense of something

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:45.210 align:middle line:84%
else or that awareness
that almost everyone has,

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:48.090 align:middle line:84%
or a sense that
someone they know

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:51.180 align:middle line:84%
is going to phone them
shortly, and then they do.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Those kind of gut experiences
at the beginning part.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.930 align:middle line:84%
But then I think you
go along that spectrum

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.530 align:middle line:84%
and you get to something
like remote viewing

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:03.660 align:middle line:84%
or this idea of trying
to perceive something

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:04.470 align:middle line:90%
at a distance.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And then you get to a more
full separation experience,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.190 align:middle line:84%
which is what the out
of body experience is,

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.600 align:middle line:90%
in my understanding.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And so you learned how to
control it then by the age

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:17.310 align:middle line:90%
of about 14.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:19.260 align:middle line:90%
And were you able--

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.913 align:middle line:84%
I mean, off and on-- not
necessarily every day

00:12:21.913 --> 00:12:23.580 align:middle line:84%
at every moment you
chose-- but were you

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.000 align:middle line:84%
able to continually project
yourself out of body

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.870 align:middle line:90%
after that into this time?

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, once I had the
very first experience,

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.320 align:middle line:84%
it was almost like I'd
open the floodgates.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And then I was having a lot
more out of body experiences.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:41.790 align:middle line:84%
But it took me a long time
to get comfortable with going

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.170 align:middle line:90%
further from myself.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.050 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:50.650 align:middle line:84%
The bedroom was almost like
my limit for a long time.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.945 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was to do
with my own psychological

00:12:52.945 --> 00:12:53.745 align:middle line:90%
limitations.

00:12:53.745 --> 00:12:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Fear.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Fear, sure.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:55.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:00.120 align:middle line:84%
That going outside of my
house or going further afield

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.830 align:middle line:90%
might lead to me--

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:03.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- dying
or something like that.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:05.100 align:middle line:90%
Understandable.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So it took me a long
time to get over that.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.710 align:middle line:84%
But then eventually,
I pushed through--

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.080 align:middle line:84%
literally pushed
through the window

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.290 align:middle line:84%
and moved out into
the street and then

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:20.230 align:middle line:84%
started to move around the local
area that I was familiar with.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And over time, gradually moved
further and further afield.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.010 align:middle line:90%
So that was the process.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And as I was reading
this in your book,

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:33.870 align:middle line:84%
you would talk about the
luminescence of objects,

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.233 align:middle line:90%
of trees, and inanimate objects.

00:13:36.233 --> 00:13:37.650 align:middle line:84%
I remember you
saying at one point

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.560 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes
inanimate objects almost

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.070 align:middle line:84%
seemed to possess more life
force than animate objects.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And you spoke of trees
on a number of occasions

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.990 align:middle line:84%
because you would
go out into nature

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.220 align:middle line:90%
and do quite a bit of this.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And can you talk about that
a little bit, some of what

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.550 align:middle line:84%
you saw to bring to
those who have not

00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:01.290 align:middle line:84%
had this experience the
nature energetically of a tree

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:05.160 align:middle line:90%
or a building or whatnot?

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's
maybe something to do with

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:12.000 align:middle line:84%
the frequency that
particular things operate on.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.970 align:middle line:84%
When you're in a building
like this that's been here

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.640 align:middle line:84%
for a long time
and has always had

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:84%
this sense of spiritual
activity going on,

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.860 align:middle line:84%
I think that it builds up
this aura, if you like,

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.050 align:middle line:84%
or some kind of
impression that goes

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.980 align:middle line:84%
into the very fabric
of the building.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think when I was
having my first experiences,

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.510 align:middle line:90%
I was picking up on that.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So I would go past a
building that's very old.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:44.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some buildings in
London can be 1,000 years old.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.240 align:middle line:84%
So as you pass that
building, I would

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.930 align:middle line:84%
see this sense of the energy
nature of the building.

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Maybe its true
form, if you like,

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:58.010 align:middle line:84%
or maybe just some
underlying level of it.

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And what would
that look like?

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Often, it would look
almost like heat signatures,

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:09.200 align:middle line:84%
almost like different
colors radiating out.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.980 align:middle line:84%
I often found that there
were oranges and yellows.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.910 align:middle line:84%
But it would depend
on the building,

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:17.760 align:middle line:84%
and it would maybe depend
on what the connection was

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:18.560 align:middle line:90%
with the building.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.830 align:middle line:84%
So that was something that
was interesting to explore

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:25.340 align:middle line:84%
to really look at what that
signature was and see if that

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.640 align:middle line:84%
had any relationship
to what that

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.750 align:middle line:84%
might mean, what that building
was used for, things like that.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.400 align:middle line:84%
But then on other
occasions, like I

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.380 align:middle line:84%
was saying, with trees
or with human beings,

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.130 align:middle line:84%
you might be more on that
frequency on another occasion.

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And I would see almost
like the life force

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.520 align:middle line:84%
moving through the
trunk of the tree

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.190 align:middle line:84%
or moving through
the leaves and get

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.280 align:middle line:84%
this sense of the whole
process of the plant

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.750 align:middle line:84%
drawing up nutrients from the
soil and the whole spectrum

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:00.830 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.060 align:middle line:84%
But you would see on
a different level.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And through this
outer body perception,

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.430 align:middle line:84%
it was like you could
go right into it

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:11.960 align:middle line:84%
and explore the whole
nature of that plant.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Because although maybe we would
assume that we're using eyes,

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.520 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes we would sense
a body and things like that,

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.730 align:middle line:84%
I came to the conclusion
that that's just something

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:23.720 align:middle line:90%
that we assume.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.030 align:middle line:84%
But really, we're
not using eyes.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:29.750 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a direct
link with our consciousness.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:34.430 align:middle line:84%
So we can, in my experience,
directly link with a plant

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.040 align:middle line:84%
or directly link
with another person

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.940 align:middle line:84%
and maybe get some impression
from that and draw from that.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it opens up the whole
idea of psychical abilities

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.820 align:middle line:90%
and those kinds of ideas really.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>> And you also had--

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.200 align:middle line:84%
I remember one experience
I was reading about

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.870 align:middle line:84%
in which you were emerging with
a little animal in the forest.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:56.910 align:middle line:90%
It was so sweet.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that?

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:02.000 align:middle line:84%
I just loved that
part of the story.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I used to go to
this open nature area to do--

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Was this the new forest
area or a different area?

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.079 align:middle line:84%
>> This was actually just
in London that experience

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:17.390 align:middle line:84%
happened, on Hampstead Heath,
which is a big open heath area.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And I used to go there
a lot just to meditate

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.740 align:middle line:90%
and to do different practices.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And on this particular
day, I was looking out

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:29.820 align:middle line:84%
into the darkness of the trees
and everything around me.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And I started to see
these points of light

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:36.710 align:middle line:84%
appearing as I was going
deeper into my state of trance,

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.980 align:middle line:84%
if you like, or whatever
you want to call it.

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And I started to see these
points of light all around me.

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized as I
focused on them more and more

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:51.070 align:middle line:84%
that these points of
light were little animals.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.890 align:middle line:90%
They were like consciousness.

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Little vole or
mouse-like creatures.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And as I focus more
and more, I seem

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:03.590 align:middle line:84%
to go deeper and deeper
into this connection

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.960 align:middle line:90%
with these other creatures.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, it was
like I tuned into the life

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.510 align:middle line:90%
cycle of one of these voles.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And I experienced
the whole process

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:20.960 align:middle line:84%
of it going into its home, being
around the other creatures,

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:84%
coming out, looking for
food and foraging around,

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.920 align:middle line:84%
this whole experience
of its life.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, one day,
I went out in the daylight.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.190 align:middle line:90%
And a bird of prey basically--

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:41.030 align:middle line:84%
I remember the feeling, the
talons basically coming around

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:42.840 align:middle line:90%
me in this experience.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.730 align:middle line:90%
And then the experience ending.

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Just lights went out.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you were
talking about this,

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.960 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned that there
was this sense of fear

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.200 align:middle line:84%
in this animal just to go
out and get what it needed

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.030 align:middle line:90%
to get and bring it back.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:02.270 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just the basic survival.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:05.870 align:middle line:84%
There was always a sense
of fear in the little body,

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:07.930 align:middle line:84%
just getting
through another day.

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:10.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, a sense of--

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:11.600 align:middle line:90%
especially at daylight.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:17.080 align:middle line:84%
The daylight was quite
fearful and dangerous.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And also a sense of awareness
of all the other creatures.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:26.800 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like they were
very joined much more than I

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.797 align:middle line:90%
experience in a human sense.

00:19:28.797 --> 00:19:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>> They had to be aware of
where the other species were,

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.190 align:middle line:84%
what they were doing,
whether they were in danger,

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:34.150 align:middle line:90%
whether they were safe.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:35.370 align:middle line:90%
>> And each other as well.

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:36.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:40.110 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like their survival
instinct was joining together.

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:41.680 align:middle line:90%
And that's how they operated.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.020 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, that was a very
interesting experience.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:49.270 align:middle line:84%
It was like this opened up this
real insight to other animals

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:52.150 align:middle line:84%
and that we're all on
a continuum of life.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:55.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not we're human and
they're something else.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.990 align:middle line:84%
We're all part of the process
of life is how I see it.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And this really is the theme
throughout the book is once

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.890 align:middle line:84%
you've started being able to
navigate in these other areas

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:10.210 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, this sense of
connectivity where human beings

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:13.310 align:middle line:90%
feel distinctly separate.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think definitely the
theme running through is that

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:84%
from this direct experience,
there is this sense

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:24.100 align:middle line:84%
of interconnectedness or of
oneness or that we're not all

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:29.570 align:middle line:84%
divided up, which I think is
quite an age old spiritual

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:30.370 align:middle line:90%
teaching.

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:32.710 align:middle line:84%
But I think through
experiences like this,

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:36.430 align:middle line:84%
we can directly
encounter that, and we

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:40.980 align:middle line:84%
can know that rather than
just kind of theorize about it

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.090 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I think
is really valuable that I

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.740 align:middle line:90%
was trying to get across.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And that it doesn't really
matter the context either.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, talking about
the fact that I grew up

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:57.130 align:middle line:84%
in quite a rough part of
London and things like that,

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.080 align:middle line:84%
I think that all
added to the process

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:03.940 align:middle line:84%
because it gave me this
sense of separation

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.970 align:middle line:84%
maybe to a lot of
the traditional ideas

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:10.363 align:middle line:84%
of spirituality, but not in a
way that I thought they were

00:21:10.363 --> 00:21:11.530 align:middle line:90%
wrong or anything like that.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:15.460 align:middle line:84%
But a separation that I needed
something slightly different

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.850 align:middle line:84%
to speak to me
because I was coming

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.180 align:middle line:84%
from a slightly different
social cultural experience

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.690 align:middle line:84%
to what most people who
talk about these things are.

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:28.600 align:middle line:84%
So I think that was important
with writing the book as well.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.963 align:middle line:84%
And you had to deal with
your own survival issues,

00:21:30.963 --> 00:21:33.280 align:middle line:84%
being mugged and the like,
and who you were going

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.160 align:middle line:90%
to create an alliance with.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:40.948 align:middle line:90%
And you have these experiences--

00:21:40.948 --> 00:21:42.740 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to get
to that in a moment,

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.800 align:middle line:90%
including precognition--

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.290 align:middle line:84%
where you were
literally living within

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:50.260 align:middle line:84%
these explosive
literally and violent

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:54.700 align:middle line:84%
experiences as you
were out of body.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And these were
future events, which

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.690 align:middle line:84%
brings a whole other
subject up in terms

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:01.840 align:middle line:84%
of the complexity of time and
space and what it really is.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed that you
were being confronted

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.420 align:middle line:84%
with the notion of
making choices constantly

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.030 align:middle line:84%
but also of looking
at and evaluating

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:13.370 align:middle line:90%
the nature of acts of violence.

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And this became a theme that
you were working through

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.240 align:middle line:90%
from the other side.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about what happened
there and then the first

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:23.860 align:middle line:90%
of the precognitive events?

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.500 align:middle line:90%


00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, because of the
environment I grew up

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.140 align:middle line:84%
in in London, there
was, I would say,

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:35.140 align:middle line:84%
a lot of frustration and a
lot of inequality and a lot

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.220 align:middle line:90%
of problems around me.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Lot of poverty I assume.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think that led
to people sometimes acting

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.500 align:middle line:84%
violently towards me and
to other people around.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
sense of survival

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:53.140 align:middle line:84%
that came into the
equation again.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:57.100 align:middle line:84%
There was this sense
that I had to deal

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.380 align:middle line:90%
with what London was creating.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, I
built up this block,

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:05.740 align:middle line:84%
this persona that
was about dealing

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.890 align:middle line:84%
with how people can
treat each other

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:14.140 align:middle line:84%
and how a big city can influence
you and change the way you

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.010 align:middle line:90%
interact with other people.

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So there was this real
sense that for a long time,

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:23.620 align:middle line:90%
I was quite trapped in that.

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.780 align:middle line:84%
But then with the out
of body experiences,

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:30.310 align:middle line:84%
I started to get this sense of
through the interconnectedness

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:33.500 align:middle line:84%
that there was no need
for that separation.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, if
we let go of that,

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.830 align:middle line:84%
then we can start to
change that situation,

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:40.990 align:middle line:84%
and we can start to
understand that situation

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:43.480 align:middle line:84%
and look at the
frustrations and the things

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.210 align:middle line:84%
that cause people to
act in those ways.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:51.970 align:middle line:84%
So I think the whole
crux of spirituality

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:54.640 align:middle line:84%
in a way started to
seem to me that it

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:58.210 align:middle line:84%
was to do with an idea
of arising compassion,

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:00.820 align:middle line:84%
that the more you experience
this interconnectedness,

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.890 align:middle line:84%
or the more that
you see that people

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:05.530 align:middle line:84%
act in certain ways,
violent or whatever,

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:09.170 align:middle line:84%
because they've been through
certain things in their life,

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:13.350 align:middle line:84%
it's like the situations
will inform us, I believe.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And through that,
you become whatever

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.530 align:middle line:90%
you're going to become.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And if we can open up to
these spiritual level,

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:22.490 align:middle line:84%
no matter who you
are at the beginning,

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:26.330 align:middle line:84%
it starts to break down
those violent aspects

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:30.200 align:middle line:84%
of your personality or
the disconnected aspects

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.380 align:middle line:90%
of your personality.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:34.100 align:middle line:84%
So that was kind
of the process I've

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.720 align:middle line:90%
been through with all of that.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.850 align:middle line:84%
But then with the
precognitive experiences,

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:46.160 align:middle line:84%
they really helped to open me
up to thinking about compassion

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:46.993 align:middle line:90%
and thinking about--

00:24:46.993 --> 00:24:49.452 align:middle line:84%
because for a long time, I was
wondering what they actually

00:24:49.452 --> 00:24:50.310 align:middle line:90%
meant.

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:54.130 align:middle line:84%
For example, the first
one happened in '99.

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And I had this
experience where it

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.730 align:middle line:84%
was the most intense
experience I ever had.

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:05.860 align:middle line:84%
We were doing a small
workshop with five friends,

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.150 align:middle line:90%
and we were in this big space.

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And we went through
this G technique,

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:13.190 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the techniques
I've developed for inducing out

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:14.900 align:middle line:90%
of body experiences.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And on this particular day,
I went really, really deep

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:22.160 align:middle line:90%
into a very deep trance state.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And then I found
myself moving through

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:26.060 align:middle line:90%
this natural environment.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And then from that, there was
a kind of break in the vision,

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:31.860 align:middle line:90%
in the experience.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself
standing on Old Compton

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Street in Soho in central
London looking down the street.

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And there was people
moving around,

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.810 align:middle line:84%
and everything was
happening as it usually did.

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:45.440 align:middle line:84%
But my vision was
completely bluish gray.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Everything around me looked
tinted with that color.

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is another
example of how

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:55.520 align:middle line:84%
vision kind of can represent
what you're seeing maybe

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.770 align:middle line:90%
in some ways.

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly there
was this explosion burst

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:03.360 align:middle line:84%
out from the right hand side
of the street up ahead of me.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a man running
towards the explosion,

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and then I saw other people, the
chaos all happening from that.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt almost this
wave of emotion hit me.

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.620 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't move from the spot.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:24.160 align:middle line:84%
I was just kind of frozen on the
spot looking down the street.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And then the experience
slowly faded away.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.570 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't leave me.

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:33.810 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like that
emotional impact that I'd had

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:35.760 align:middle line:90%
was still with me.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.310 align:middle line:84%
So even though I started
to become present,

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:42.360 align:middle line:84%
I was in the room
again, I had this sense

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.120 align:middle line:84%
that I couldn't just
come straight out of it.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.490 align:middle line:84%
So I remember, there
was a friend near me,

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:50.450 align:middle line:84%
and he was almost
coaxing me out of it.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And he was aware of the
depth of what happened.

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Everyone had this sense
that this really strong

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.260 align:middle line:90%
powerful experience between us.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:06.390 align:middle line:84%
So there was this feeling
of almost like foreboding,

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:10.380 align:middle line:84%
quite a heavy feeling in
the room because of this.

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And as I gradually
came out of it

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and my friend
coaxed me out of it,

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.280 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to continue
even for days afterwards.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.090 align:middle line:84%
I had not a negative
feeling or a foreboding

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:23.680 align:middle line:84%
after that, but for the
few days afterwards.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.490 align:middle line:84%
I just had this sense of things
before they happened almost.

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I was on
a bus a few days after,

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.200 align:middle line:84%
and I just started thinking
of someone I hadn't

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.910 align:middle line:90%
seen in two years or whatever.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:39.335 align:middle line:84%
And then I think it was
about three stops later,

00:27:39.335 --> 00:27:40.460 align:middle line:90%
that person got on the bus.

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Got on the bus.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>> But this is within a day
or two with the other thing.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:51.930 align:middle line:84%
So as yet, it hadn't happened,
but I'd seen this bombing.

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And then literally
five days later, there

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:56.985 align:middle line:90%
was this explosion.

00:27:56.985 --> 00:27:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>> The Soho bombing.

00:27:58.390 --> 00:27:59.370 align:middle line:90%
That's what you saw.

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>> It happened.

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:01.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:02.440 align:middle line:90%
So that--

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>> And this happened again.

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:05.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, with the
London bombings,

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:07.120 align:middle line:90%
you had the same experience.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.420 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting
the way I've always

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.620 align:middle line:84%
seemed to have this
connection with London.

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:13.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, you're of that.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's part
of your frequencies.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:22.950 align:middle line:84%
But how did you contend
with the time and space

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:25.350 align:middle line:90%
aspect of what had happened?

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:26.635 align:middle line:90%
>> It was really difficult.

00:28:26.635 --> 00:28:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you were
you were living it.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.210 align:middle line:90%
You were feeling the event.

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, with the
first experience,

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:36.930 align:middle line:84%
I did think that it
was going to happen,

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:40.350 align:middle line:84%
but I'd never had a
precognition before.

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And I only believed
it was going to happen

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:45.320 align:middle line:84%
because of the intensity
and the realism of it.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't aware of anything
else that happened like that.

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:52.740 align:middle line:84%
So I was convinced in
some ways that it would,

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.780 align:middle line:90%
but I couldn't be sure.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.760 align:middle line:84%
But then when it
happened five days later,

00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:00.450 align:middle line:90%
obviously, that really threw me.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:01.650 align:middle line:90%
Just threw me, yeah.

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you have to then begin
questioning things like what is

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.460 align:middle line:90%
essentially predestined?

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.080 align:middle line:84%
If you had already
experienced it

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.570 align:middle line:84%
five days before
it occurred, you

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:14.580 align:middle line:84%
were obviously out of
the time space continuum

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.860 align:middle line:84%
into what we would in a linear
fashion call the future,

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.970 align:middle line:84%
but not necessarily if it's
all unfolding at the same time.

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:23.110 align:middle line:84%
You were in another
dimensional aspect of time.

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>> It could have
been a potentiality.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:25.992 align:middle line:84%
>> It could have
been a potentiality.

00:29:25.992 --> 00:29:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>> There's lots
of possibilities.

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:31.240 align:middle line:84%
But it really opened me
up to exploring that.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when I
was writing the book,

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.110 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to people
like Dean Radin.

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I talked to lots of different
scientists and tried to get

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:45.730 align:middle line:84%
this sense of what might have
been going on that level.

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to take this almost
neutral position that I think

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:53.160 align:middle line:84%
the best thing to do is to
keep exploring the experiences

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.850 align:middle line:84%
and see where that unfolds
and see what that shows us

00:29:56.850 --> 00:30:01.795 align:middle line:84%
and try not to commit to any
particular ideology or theory.

00:30:01.795 --> 00:30:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Because I think, in
a way, those things

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.760 align:middle line:84%
stop us finding out what
might be really going

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.700 align:middle line:90%
on in some ways.

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.520 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, I just explored.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And then this other
experience happened

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:20.760 align:middle line:84%
where I was over Moorgate
Station, tube station.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And I moved down
over the station

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:27.260 align:middle line:84%
and went down literary
straight through the floor

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.480 align:middle line:90%
through the black pavement.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>> And you were bold by then.

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I was bold.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>> You were bold in
your adventures by then.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.620 align:middle line:90%
Out of the bedroom.

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:35.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sure.

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:39.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these
experiences as well

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.010 align:middle line:84%
had this feeling
that I didn't even

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:42.660 align:middle line:90%
have the separation process.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.230 align:middle line:90%
I would just find myself there.

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:47.400 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of like I was
just being drawn there

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.240 align:middle line:90%
in an instant.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.690 align:middle line:84%
So it did feel very
much like I was supposed

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:54.640 align:middle line:90%
to witness these things.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:31:01.320 align:middle line:84%
So I went down through the
pavement into the tunnel.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:05.430 align:middle line:84%
So I was literally
floating in the middle

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:10.360 align:middle line:84%
of where the train would be, but
there was no train there yet.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And I was just looking out to
the signs and Moorgate Station

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:17.970 align:middle line:90%
signs along the platform.

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And then the train did come in,
and I was basically inside it.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:27.740 align:middle line:84%
But I let it go out
of the station again,

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:29.970 align:middle line:90%
and then I followed behind.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:33.930 align:middle line:84%
So now it was heading off
into Liverpool Street Station.

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And as I came up behind
it and it moved out

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.530 align:middle line:84%
to the next station, I
stopped at Liverpool Street,

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:42.110 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't continue to follow.

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And the train went
off into the tunnel,

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and that's when the
explosion happened.

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And again, I had this kind
of emotional wave hit me,

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.650 align:middle line:84%
an emotional wave at
the same time almost

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:59.496 align:middle line:84%
as the physical wave,
the impact of the--

00:31:59.496 --> 00:32:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The collective
emotional impact.

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:02.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>> So with that particular
one, it was really different

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.200 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of ways
because afterwards,

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.410 align:middle line:84%
I had this real sense that
it was going to happen

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:19.530 align:middle line:84%
because I'd had the previous
experience a few years earlier.

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:22.180 align:middle line:84%
But in that experience, I didn't
know whether it would happen

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:22.980 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.630 align:middle line:84%
But this one, I felt much more
convinced that it would happen.

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:27.480 align:middle line:90%
It had the bluish--

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I was just going to say it
had the signature blue energy,

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:30.880 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And that denotes future events
oftentimes in your experience,

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:34.670 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>> It has-- I've only ever had
three of those experiences.

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:41.300 align:middle line:90%
One was the most--

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:45.140 align:middle line:84%
well, one of the most accurate
experiences I had in terms

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:49.280 align:middle line:84%
of being able to see the
way things were objectively.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.320 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have a
precognitive element,

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.930 align:middle line:84%
or I don't think it had
a precognitive element.

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:56.930 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing to show
that it was a future event.

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:04.040 align:middle line:84%
But I traveled to
this office room

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.950 align:middle line:84%
near to Portobello Road Market,
one of the famous markets

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:08.180 align:middle line:90%
in London.

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And then in that
office, I could see

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.980 align:middle line:84%
the name of the
person on his desk,

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:18.710 align:middle line:90%
and I could see the postcode.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:24.870 align:middle line:84%
West 11, I remember, the white
signs you get across London.

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And just that I knew where it
was by location, by the trip

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.600 align:middle line:90%
I'd gone through.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to
verify that by checking

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.720 align:middle line:84%
his address and the name and
seeing that they matched.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And going back
there in physical form.

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:40.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So that was also the bluish
gray kind of experience.

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And then there was the
Soho bombing and then

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.980 align:middle line:90%
the London bombings.

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So all of those
had that quality.

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:54.590 align:middle line:84%
So I know that if something
happens in that way, it's--

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:55.584 align:middle line:90%
>> It's real.

00:33:55.584 --> 00:33:56.384 align:middle line:90%
It's likely real.

00:33:56.384 --> 00:33:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a important experience.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, important.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:01.910 align:middle line:90%
Now, this became known--

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:04.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously,
you've done lectures,

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:05.120 align:middle line:90%
you've written a book.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.640 align:middle line:84%
You have enabled, as
you say, to connect

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.250 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of the people in
the field of quantum physics

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.170 align:middle line:90%
such as Dean Radin and others.

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And also, you've connected
with Rupert Sheldrake, who

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:17.870 align:middle line:90%
we'll be meeting with tomorrow.

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And can you talk a little
bit about the nature

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.960 align:middle line:84%
of what you've been doing
in conjunction with Rupert

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and some of these very
interesting experiments

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.750 align:middle line:90%
that are happening?

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, with Rupert,
we initially contact--

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.969 align:middle line:84%
well, I initially got in
contact with him to do with--

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:38.449 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to create
an experiment that

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:40.670 align:middle line:84%
would be almost
like an installation

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:42.320 align:middle line:84%
because I've worked
with installation

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.290 align:middle line:84%
on these large constructions
that are designed

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:49.370 align:middle line:84%
to help people have out of
body experiences or experience

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:52.230 align:middle line:90%
something beyond themselves.

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:55.250 align:middle line:84%
So I've worked with
that a lot in the past.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was interested in the
idea of doing that with Rupert

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:01.910 align:middle line:84%
and seeing if we could
take some of the ideas

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:05.390 align:middle line:84%
that he's looking at in
his scientific experiments

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:08.360 align:middle line:84%
and building that into
some kind of installation.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.280 align:middle line:90%
So that was our initial idea.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened was
he done some recent research.

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And some skeptics
had turned around

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and said, well,
this research could

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.470 align:middle line:84%
have been done by cheating
with a mobile phone

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:27.390 align:middle line:90%
or something of that nature.

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So then we started looking
into the possibility

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:32.720 align:middle line:84%
of doing some experiments
that would be done in a place

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.560 align:middle line:84%
that mobile phones
could not be used

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.220 align:middle line:90%
or no signals could be used.

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:40.845 align:middle line:84%
So we ended up finding
this deep basement.

00:35:40.845 --> 00:35:41.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Dungeon.

00:35:41.645 --> 00:35:41.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Dungeon almost in East London
with very thick concrete walls

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:50.000 align:middle line:90%
and a metal door.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And from that, we thought this
would be the perfect location

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.200 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And we even went
one step further

00:35:56.810 --> 00:36:00.770 align:middle line:84%
and used a device that
cuts out all mobile phone

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:02.870 align:middle line:90%
signals for 100 meters.

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:05.860 align:middle line:84%
So it was only used
within the building,

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.690 align:middle line:84%
but we had that down
in the basement.

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And then what was the
nature of the experiment?

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>> The experiments
were on telepathy.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:16.730 align:middle line:84%
So we wanted to telephone
telepathy specifically.

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So we wanted to see if we could
do this in a literal setup

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.170 align:middle line:84%
with having people
physically there and then

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:30.770 align:middle line:84%
having-- the whole thing
was computer automated.

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:34.550 align:middle line:84%
So it would randomly
select a person

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:36.500 align:middle line:90%
from this person's friends.

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
answer the phone,

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and they would have to press
the number on the keypad, which

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.970 align:middle line:84%
would tell the system
which person they

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:45.440 align:middle line:90%
thought was calling.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:48.830 align:middle line:84%
So there was this sense of
they had to reach out and try

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:51.350 align:middle line:84%
and say is it my mother
or is it my father

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:53.900 align:middle line:84%
or whichever person
they'd selected.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And it didn't matter whether
it is literally the mother

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.320 align:middle line:90%
or father.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:01.060 align:middle line:84%
As you say, this was a
computer selected experience.

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, it was literally
the person on the other end

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:03.870 align:middle line:90%
of the phone.

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it did?

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>> But the computer
would pick who to call.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So what would happen
is it would call that

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:11.240 align:middle line:90%
person's mother.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And then there would
be an open line,

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:15.320 align:middle line:84%
and then the person
doing the experiment

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:18.590 align:middle line:84%
would pick up the phone, and
it would get a computer system

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:20.600 align:middle line:84%
which would ask
them who they think

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.880 align:middle line:90%
is waiting to be connected.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.790 align:middle line:84%
So then they'd have
to select the caller,

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:27.170 align:middle line:90%
and it went from there.

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And this was part of Rupert's
work over several years as he--

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:36.800 align:middle line:84%
the Perrott-Warrick research
he was doing at Cambridge.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:41.390 align:middle line:84%
So he put this all into
his database of research

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:42.260 align:middle line:90%
over many years.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And he's now completed
that whole process.

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:47.500 align:middle line:84%
I think five years
he was doing that.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.630 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to be
talking about that tomorrow.

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:58.380 align:middle line:84%
But although I think
certainly people like Rupert

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:01.010 align:middle line:84%
are just pearls on this
planet, that they're

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:02.810 align:middle line:84%
willing to have the
patience and time

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:04.910 align:middle line:84%
and open mind and
curiosity to take

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:08.060 align:middle line:84%
on these kinds of experiments,
from your point of view

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:11.720 align:middle line:84%
being someone who has
been able to simply live

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:16.910 align:middle line:84%
within these experiences from a
very early age, what do you see

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:19.910 align:middle line:90%
as the next leap, so to speak?

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:22.015 align:middle line:90%
How long does--

00:38:22.015 --> 00:38:23.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm just asking
your impressions.

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:24.807 align:middle line:84%
How long do we
have to keep trying

00:38:24.807 --> 00:38:29.270 align:middle line:84%
to prove that these phenomena
exist within each of us?

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Ooh.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.295 align:middle line:84%
I think the next step
is the bringing together

00:38:34.295 --> 00:38:39.950 align:middle line:84%
of brain science in a
way and the research

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:42.560 align:middle line:84%
into psychic abilities
as they are now.

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Because I think what
we've got is on one side,

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:48.260 align:middle line:84%
you've got skeptics
doing neuroscience

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.360 align:middle line:84%
that says, oh, if I stimulate
this part of the brain,

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:54.050 align:middle line:84%
and this person feels
like they're floating,

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:55.880 align:middle line:84%
that means that out
of body experiences

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:59.350 align:middle line:84%
are just this part of
the brain malfunctioning.

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:03.140 align:middle line:84%
To me, that doesn't
follow because we

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:07.070 align:middle line:84%
can stimulate the brain to think
other things as well, which

00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:08.030 align:middle line:90%
are not illusionary.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:10.340 align:middle line:84%
For example, if I
stimulate the brain

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:13.790 align:middle line:84%
to think I'm tasting
an apple in my mouth,

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:17.510 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean the apples
are therefore an illusion.

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:20.640 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of thinking
doesn't really stand up.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>> That's very
materialistic by nature.

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:24.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>> What you experienced a view
that illuminated that room from

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:30.200 align:middle line:84%
the very first experience, there
was nothing materialistic about

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.000 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.300 align:middle line:90%
There was no material there.

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.490 align:middle line:84%
But I try to keep
objective and to say, well,

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:39.140 align:middle line:84%
can we test these things
and can we look at them?

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think to some degree,
we can, especially with things

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:44.410 align:middle line:90%
like remote viewing.

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:46.580 align:middle line:84%
I think it's harder with
out of body experiences

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:49.370 align:middle line:84%
because they're
less controllable.

00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:53.120 align:middle line:84%
But it is something I think
needs to be done more.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, the way
I think that can be done

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:58.640 align:middle line:84%
is by bringing what we
know of the neuroscience

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.990 align:middle line:84%
together with research
like what Rupert is doing.

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:05.113 align:middle line:84%
Or I think there is a few
people like Michael Persinger.

00:40:05.113 --> 00:40:06.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you know his work.

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:07.230 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know him.

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:08.030 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>> He developed a thing called
the Koren Helmet or the God

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:15.440 align:middle line:90%
Helmet, as it's been nicknamed.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And it uses magnetic fields
to stimulate the brain

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.620 align:middle line:84%
and can induce mystical
type experiences

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:29.330 align:middle line:84%
or it seems to be able to induce
mystical type experiences.

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of the skeptics have
drawn from Persinger's work

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:37.460 align:middle line:84%
and said, well, this shows that
all these things must therefore

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:39.660 align:middle line:90%
be illusions, like I was saying.

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:41.530 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing is Persinger

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:43.550 align:middle line:90%
himself doesn't believe that.

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Persinger has been exploring
remote viewing and telepathy

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:51.490 align:middle line:84%
and believes that what we
can do by bringing together

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:54.410 align:middle line:84%
the neuroscience is
we can get to a point

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:58.460 align:middle line:84%
where we might be able
to enhance these things.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Because all psychic
abilities seem to be--

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:05.420 align:middle line:84%
if you're like a weak signal,
like a weak radio signal.

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And any sort of
psychical ability

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:11.946 align:middle line:84%
is an ability to tune
into that signal.

00:41:11.946 --> 00:41:15.770 align:middle line:90%
And maybe we can enhance that.

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And we've seen some of
that through work in the more

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:22.710 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated forms of neuro
feedback and certainly where

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:27.580 align:middle line:84%
they run tests on 30, 40 year
practicing Buddhist monks where

00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:30.120 align:middle line:84%
their gamma activity will
be off the charts compared

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:33.090 align:middle line:84%
to the average
person, for example.

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And that same
technology with practice

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:38.890 align:middle line:90%
can also boost those states.

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:43.380 align:middle line:84%
So this appears to be almost a
chemical interface between you

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:46.610 align:middle line:90%
and the actual physical brain.

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>> The self and the brain.

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:53.130 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's an area
that really fascinates me.

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
where things are going.

00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:59.100 align:middle line:84%
I think we can really look
towards bringing together

00:41:59.100 --> 00:41:59.920 align:middle line:90%
those two things.

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe in the future,
what we now call psychical

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:05.820 align:middle line:84%
will actually be something
that we can really tune

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:08.580 align:middle line:90%
into in a very efficient way.

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:12.030 align:middle line:84%
It might be a new
form of internet

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:middle line:84%
or a new form of
technology that's

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:19.500 align:middle line:84%
never been imagined before
bringing our own abilities

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:23.670 align:middle line:84%
closer, allowing normal
people who maybe never

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:27.220 align:middle line:84%
have these kinds of experiences
to connect that easier.

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.353 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's what a lot
of people have been looking

00:42:30.353 --> 00:42:31.500 align:middle line:90%
towards over the years.

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Robert Monroe, for
example with his research

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:38.010 align:middle line:84%
into hemi sync and
looking at different ways

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:44.070 align:middle line:84%
to allow everyday people who
don't have these things to get

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:47.920 align:middle line:90%
closer to those states.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And so have you had any of
your own future visions about

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:51.640 align:middle line:90%
any of this?

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, have you ever
been out looking around,

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:57.990 align:middle line:84%
and then have you
glimpsed the future?

00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I've not looked into
specifically that kind

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.550 align:middle line:90%
of thing, no.

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:05.830 align:middle line:84%
With the precognitive things,
they tend to just happen.

00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:09.370 align:middle line:90%
>> So I haven't attempted that.

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:11.220 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
very interesting you

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.940 align:middle line:84%
can explore those kinds of
ideas with remote viewing.

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And I do work sometimes
with developing those areas

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:20.230 align:middle line:90%
and looking into those areas.

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:21.990 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, not as yet.

00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:23.580 align:middle line:90%
I haven't looked into that one.

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And what about your
generation from your perception

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:26.640 align:middle line:90%
of it?

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:30.580 align:middle line:84%
I notice my son-- who
is now 29 years old--

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.760 align:middle line:84%
I notice a very
distinctly different way

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:36.300 align:middle line:84%
of interacting with each other
and accepting each other, more

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:37.230 align:middle line:90%
of an openness.

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:40.980 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the old structures
for his generation--

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.960 align:middle line:84%
you're little older
than that, but still--

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:47.040 align:middle line:84%
seem to really be dying
out, which I think

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.230 align:middle line:90%
is a fabulous thing, personally.

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:52.180 align:middle line:84%
What do you see your generation
bringing to the table

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:54.280 align:middle line:90%
and moving into en mass?

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying specifically
because, of course,

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.100 align:middle line:84%
there's every variance
in your generation

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:01.260 align:middle line:84%
as mine and my parents
and grandparents.

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:02.700 align:middle line:84%
But what do you
see the uniqueness

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:05.280 align:middle line:84%
of what your generation brings
and the ones you've been

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.900 align:middle line:90%
doing this kind of work with?

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I think-- like you said, I
think there's a real openness.

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:17.070 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a shift away
from the structures and even

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:20.550 align:middle line:84%
the whole way that
we think about ideas.

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:23.450 align:middle line:84%
For example, when
I've been to debates

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:25.710 align:middle line:84%
or when I've taken
part in debates

00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:30.450 align:middle line:84%
and those kinds of ways, we
think about ideas in the world

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:34.410 align:middle line:84%
seem to be very competitive
and very black and white

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:37.220 align:middle line:84%
that you will have one side
on one side of the debate

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:38.150 align:middle line:90%
and the other side.

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.650 align:middle line:90%
And they--

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:39.775 align:middle line:90%
>> Affirmative and negative

00:44:39.775 --> 00:44:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>> They argue.

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And then there's not this
sense of can we mutually learn?

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.108 align:middle line:84%
Can we mutually
try to understand

00:44:48.108 --> 00:44:49.650 align:middle line:84%
where the other
person is coming from

00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:52.620 align:middle line:84%
or develop or add
to my perspective

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:54.900 align:middle line:84%
from learning about
your perspective?

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:58.260 align:middle line:84%
In a way, it seems
like the ideas

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:02.050 align:middle line:84%
that have been there before
seem almost immature, in a way.

00:45:02.050 --> 00:45:05.790 align:middle line:84%
I feel like we might be maturing
to a more understanding,

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:11.610 align:middle line:84%
more accepting, more balanced
way of working with things

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:14.340 align:middle line:84%
that's focused on learning
rather than focused on I'm

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:15.510 align:middle line:90%
right and you're wrong.

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Winning.

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Winning, exactly.

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:19.770 align:middle line:84%
This competitive
sense that seems

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:25.320 align:middle line:84%
to have dominated thinking
for a long time in philosophy,

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.020 align:middle line:84%
in so many areas that really
shouldn't be like that.

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:31.990 align:middle line:84%
It should be about moving
towards a better understanding.

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think psychical research
and the skeptic proponent

00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:41.160 align:middle line:84%
divide that you see a lot that
we were just talking about

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:42.810 align:middle line:90%
is a good example of that.

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Because instead of
trying to say, well,

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:47.340 align:middle line:84%
what are the
skeptics getting at?

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Why do they see the things
the way they see things?

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And why did the
believers or proponents

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.060 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you
want to call it, why

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:55.530 align:middle line:90%
do they see things like that?

00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And trying to say,
well, maybe we

00:45:57.570 --> 00:46:00.060 align:middle line:90%
can learn a bit from each side.

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Because I think you can learn
from a skeptical position

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:07.320 align:middle line:84%
of not just believing
everything and being discerning

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:10.020 align:middle line:90%
in how you understand things.

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And also not jumping in with
both feet and just saying,

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:16.530 align:middle line:90%
well, let's take our time.

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
to know the answers.

00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:21.300 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
know all the truths.

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.950 align:middle line:84%
We can enjoy the process of
we're moving towards that.

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Truth could actually be
our guide in the process

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:30.600 align:middle line:84%
rather than the end
result, if you like.

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a beautiful
way to put it.

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:34.960 align:middle line:90%
And it's so much healthier.

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:38.745 align:middle line:84%
A place to come from
in your explorations

00:46:38.745 --> 00:46:40.620 align:middle line:84%
is looking toward the
journey than the answer

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:42.330 align:middle line:90%
and being right.

00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:44.700 align:middle line:84%
There's such a rush to
be right so that someone

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:47.310 align:middle line:84%
can own a certain type
of intellectual terrain

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:50.700 align:middle line:84%
or property that it actually
blocks the exploration

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.090 align:middle line:90%
for a greater truth.

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:53.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:55.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you really
want to get to truth,

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:59.850 align:middle line:84%
then you can't just take a
philosophy and say, right.

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:01.770 align:middle line:84%
I think that one
works and that fits.

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I'm not going
to look at anything else.

00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm just going to
defend this territory.

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Because really, the
likelihood that's

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:14.100 align:middle line:84%
actually moving you away
from the truth or whatever.

00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:16.600 align:middle line:84%
But we do see that far
too much unfortunately.

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, that's where
I see the future.

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>> And any final thoughts?

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:23.683 align:middle line:84%
You wrote this
book for a reason.

00:47:23.683 --> 00:47:24.850 align:middle line:90%
You were compelled to do it.

00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of beauty in it.

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:33.000 align:middle line:84%
I think I wrote the book
because I wanted to reach out

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.720 align:middle line:84%
to people who may be coming
from a different background

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:40.050 align:middle line:84%
or a different set of
ideas or experiences.

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to really
try and reach them

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:46.470 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, spirituality
happens everywhere.

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:51.180 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't happen just
in a Buddhist monastery

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:53.670 align:middle line:90%
or in some place by a lake.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:55.740 align:middle line:84%
It does happen in
the middle of a city

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:58.770 align:middle line:84%
with negative things
happening around you.

00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually draw
from the worst of situations

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.310 align:middle line:90%
and grow from that.

00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:05.910 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
really what I was trying

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:07.590 align:middle line:90%
to get across in the book.

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:10.980 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole concept of it
being about the human spirit

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:12.650 align:middle line:90%
in both senses of the word.

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:16.590 align:middle line:84%
The sense of us trying to
move out of the limitations

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:19.197 align:middle line:90%
that we might find ourselves in.

00:48:19.197 --> 00:48:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, beautifully done.

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And I appreciate
you taking the time.

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:25.260 align:middle line:84%
You're actually living
in Estonia right now.

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:27.360 align:middle line:90%
So we've both come a ways.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:29.205 align:middle line:90%
We've come from San Francisco.

00:48:29.205 --> 00:48:32.290 align:middle line:84%
I thank you for taking the
time to be here with us.

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:33.710 align:middle line:90%
It was really nice.

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a pleasure meeting you.

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:36.236 align:middle line:90%
>> You too.

00:48:36.236 --> 00:48:37.685 align:middle line:90%
