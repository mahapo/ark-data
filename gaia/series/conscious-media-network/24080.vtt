00:00:02.125 --> 00:00:04.645
<v ->You might want to watch Lorraine Day Part One</v>

2
00:00:04.645 --> 00:00:06.265
before digging into this one.

3
00:00:06.265 --> 00:00:08.185
In part one, she tells her story of how,

4
00:00:08.185 --> 00:00:11.365
as an orthopedic surgeon and chief of the trauma department

5
00:00:11.365 --> 00:00:14.056
of a high-profile San Francisco hospital,

6
00:00:14.056 --> 00:00:16.976
she chose to forgo traditional medical treatment

7
00:00:16.976 --> 00:00:19.516
when faced with a life-threatening cancer.

8
00:00:19.516 --> 00:00:21.596
She discovered the true basis for healing

9
00:00:21.596 --> 00:00:22.896
and then lived to tell the story.

10
00:00:22.896 --> 00:00:25.616
In part two, Lorraine stirs a lot of pots

11
00:00:25.616 --> 00:00:27.921
and shares information that you have likely

12
00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:30.376
never heard before concerning cancer,

13
00:00:30.376 --> 00:00:33.676
AIDS, bird flu, sudden infant death syndrome,

14
00:00:33.676 --> 00:00:37.656
vaccines and the link between abortion and breast cancer.

15
00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:45.416 line:15% 
Now let's dig into the cancer industry,

16
00:00:45.416 --> 00:00:49.466
AIDS, bird flu and beyond.

17
00:00:49.936 --> 00:00:52.596
Because this is really, this is serious stuff

18
00:00:52.596 --> 00:00:54.296
people need to know about.

19
00:00:54.296 --> 00:00:56.016
<v ->That's right.
<v Regina>Let's start with cancer.</v>

20
00:00:56.016 --> 00:00:59.416
The medical industry, in general,

21
00:00:59.416 --> 00:01:02.756
is really developed for control

22
00:01:02.756 --> 00:01:04.976
and for financial gain.

23
00:01:04.976 --> 00:01:07.936
It has no other reason for existing.

24
00:01:07.936 --> 00:01:11.436
As I've said before, you do need a doctor

25
00:01:11.436 --> 00:01:14.036
if you've been run over by a truck.

26
00:01:14.036 --> 00:01:17.356
But you don't need a doctor to keep you healthy.

27
00:01:17.356 --> 00:01:19.836
You don't need a doctor from chronic disease.

28
00:01:19.836 --> 00:01:21.836
Most people die from chronic disease

29
00:01:21.836 --> 00:01:23.876
and people say, "Well, if you don't get disease,

30
00:01:23.876 --> 00:01:25.896
"how do you die?"

31
00:01:25.896 --> 00:01:28.036
Well, we're not supposed to get disease

32
00:01:28.036 --> 00:01:31.096
and be all crippled up and be in pain and die that way.

33
00:01:31.096 --> 00:01:34.636
We're supposed to live until we die.

34
00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.676
And there are some people who live right

35
00:01:36.676 --> 00:01:38.076
and eat right.

36
00:01:38.076 --> 00:01:40.796
I had this acquaintance who was 94 years old,

37
00:01:40.796 --> 00:01:44.156
a man who swam 50 laps everyday.

38
00:01:44.156 --> 00:01:47.316
And when he was 94,

39
00:01:47.316 --> 00:01:50.616
he swam his 50 laps one day

40
00:01:50.616 --> 00:01:52.236
and he came over to the side of the pool

41
00:01:52.236 --> 00:01:53.516
and he said to his friends,

42
00:01:53.516 --> 00:01:55.436
"I'm not feeling so well, can you help me out?"

43
00:01:55.436 --> 00:01:57.596
By the time they got him out, he was dead.

44
00:01:57.596 --> 00:01:59.316
Now that's the way to die.

45
00:01:59.316 --> 00:02:01.176
You see, you live and you're healthy

46
00:02:01.176 --> 00:02:02.356
and you're feeling good

47
00:02:02.356 --> 00:02:04.036
until the moment you die.

48
00:02:04.036 --> 00:02:07.836
This business of getting old and crotchety

49
00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:10.876
and sick and in pain.

50
00:02:10.876 --> 00:02:14.976
In fact, when my mother was living

51
00:02:14.976 --> 00:02:18.736
in an assisted care center when she was in her late 80s

52
00:02:18.736 --> 00:02:20.896
where they would make the food for them

53
00:02:20.896 --> 00:02:22.756
but they had their own apartments,

54
00:02:22.756 --> 00:02:24.836
she was the only one out of 150 people

55
00:02:24.836 --> 00:02:26.996
who was not on drugs.

56
00:02:26.996 --> 00:02:30.886
And she, they couldn't believe it.

57
00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:33.576
They would get all of their pills out, you know,

58
00:02:33.576 --> 00:02:35.236
12 or 14 pills.

59
00:02:35.236 --> 00:02:38.076
The pharmaceutical industry is a multi-billion-,

60
00:02:38.076 --> 00:02:40.616
if not multi-trillion-dollar industry in America

61
00:02:40.616 --> 00:02:42.316
and around the world.

62
00:02:42.316 --> 00:02:44.796
People are on drugs

63
00:02:44.796 --> 00:02:47.196
in almost every stage of their lives.

64
00:02:47.196 --> 00:02:51.136
And there is a sinister plan at the very top

65
00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:53.096
to get everybody on drugs.

66
00:02:53.096 --> 00:02:55.076
Because when people are on drugs,

67
00:02:55.076 --> 00:02:57.216
first of all, all of them are mind-altering.

68
00:02:57.216 --> 00:02:59.336
Even if they're made for your stomach,

69
00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:01.816
they alter your mind and your ability to think

70
00:03:01.816 --> 00:03:05.136
and your ability to understand truth.

71
00:03:05.136 --> 00:03:08.376
And so when you are on mind-altering drugs,

72
00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:11.696
it's not much different than if you're on street drugs.

73
00:03:11.696 --> 00:03:15.378
And so all of them have so many side effects that

74
00:03:15.378 --> 00:03:18.398
people worry about their children being on street drugs

75
00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:19.978
but the reason children are on drugs

76
00:03:19.978 --> 00:03:21.898
is because their parents are on drugs.

77
00:03:21.898 --> 00:03:23.978
The parents just pay more for them

78
00:03:23.978 --> 00:03:25.978
and go to a doctor's office where the doctor

79
00:03:25.978 --> 00:03:28.598
wears a white coat and has clean fingernails.

80
00:03:28.598 --> 00:03:30.898
But they do the same sorts of things.

81
00:03:30.898 --> 00:03:32.958
And it's an escape from reality.

82
00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.338
All that drugs do is,

83
00:03:35.338 --> 00:03:38.678
they cover up the symptoms of illness.

84
00:03:38.678 --> 00:03:41.818
As I said before, disease starts in the heart

85
00:03:41.818 --> 00:03:43.758
and in the mind,

86
00:03:43.758 --> 00:03:45.718
and you have to address it there.

87
00:03:45.718 --> 00:03:47.258
You have to start being willing

88
00:03:47.258 --> 00:03:50.538
to give up the way you want to live

89
00:03:50.538 --> 00:03:52.558
and live the right way.

90
00:03:52.558 --> 00:03:54.998
And if you take drugs

91
00:03:54.998 --> 00:03:57.298
you still have the problem,

92
00:03:57.298 --> 00:03:58.958
you're just covering it up

93
00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.798
and making yourself feel better.

94
00:04:00.798 --> 00:04:03.298
You're never addressing the underlying problem.

95
00:04:03.298 --> 00:04:06.238
It's like having the wires cut

96
00:04:06.238 --> 00:04:09.258
to the flashing light on your dashboard

97
00:04:09.258 --> 00:04:11.178
tellilng you there's a problem.

98
00:04:11.178 --> 00:04:13.338
You cut the wires, the problem is still there,

99
00:04:13.338 --> 00:04:16.038
it just doesn't bother you as much

100
00:04:16.038 --> 00:04:18.658
'cause you don't have the flashing red light.

101
00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:20.338
So when you take a drug,

102
00:04:20.338 --> 00:04:22.178
it never solves the problem.

103
00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:24.276
People know that if they would just think about it.

104
00:04:24.276 --> 00:04:25.916
If you go to the doctor and the doctor says,

105
00:04:25.916 --> 00:04:27.996
"You have high blood pressure

106
00:04:27.996 --> 00:04:29.656
"and you're gong to have to be on these pills

107
00:04:29.656 --> 00:04:31.026
"the rest of your life."

108
00:04:31.026 --> 00:04:33.556
Well then you know it doesn't cure it.

109
00:04:33.556 --> 00:04:36.996
People are told when they have anxiety or depression,

110
00:04:36.996 --> 00:04:39.276
that they'll take Prozac and that will

111
00:04:39.276 --> 00:04:43.116
right the problem of the seratonin in their brain.

112
00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.596
No it doesn't.

113
00:04:44.596 --> 00:04:47.416
And it causes all sorts of other terrible problems.

114
00:04:47.416 --> 00:04:50.776
And so drugs never cure disease.

115
00:04:50.776 --> 00:04:54.376
In fact I have a video named that,

116
00:04:54.376 --> 00:04:57.262
"Drugs Never Cure Disease," because they don't.

117
00:04:57.262 --> 00:04:59.662
They only cover up the symptoms,

118
00:04:59.662 --> 00:05:02.262
So we have this whole huge industry

119
00:05:02.262 --> 00:05:04.582
that's making billions of dollars

120
00:05:04.582 --> 00:05:08.782
by making people sicker while they feel better

121
00:05:08.782 --> 00:05:10.682
getting there.

122
00:05:10.682 --> 00:05:14.762
You have to address the underlying cause of the problem,

123
00:05:14.762 --> 00:05:16.882
which is how you're eating,

124
00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:19.302
how you're living, how you're thinking,

125
00:05:19.302 --> 00:05:21.562
how you're worrying or not worrying.

126
00:05:21.562 --> 00:05:23.462
And until you address those problems

127
00:05:23.462 --> 00:05:25.102
you're going to continue,

128
00:05:25.102 --> 00:05:27.042
the disease will continue to get worse

129
00:05:27.042 --> 00:05:28.602
while you take more and more drugs

130
00:05:28.602 --> 00:05:30.262
to cover up the symptoms.

131
00:05:30.262 --> 00:05:32.722
So people start out doing that

132
00:05:32.722 --> 00:05:35.102
by just taking a pill for a headache,

133
00:05:35.102 --> 00:05:37.662
a pill for joint pains,

134
00:05:37.662 --> 00:05:40.142
a pill for stomach upset.

135
00:05:40.142 --> 00:05:43.622
And so they never address what's causing those things.

136
00:05:43.622 --> 00:05:46.102
Headaches are not normal.

137
00:05:46.102 --> 00:05:48.162
People assume they're normal.

138
00:05:48.162 --> 00:05:50.062
If you have a headache it's because you're under

139
00:05:50.062 --> 00:05:51.562
too much tension or stress

140
00:05:51.562 --> 00:05:53.262
or you're not drinking enough water

141
00:05:53.262 --> 00:05:54.682
or--
<v Regina>Toxicities.</v>

142
00:05:54.682 --> 00:05:55.958
<v ->Toxicities, whatever.</v>

143
00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.338
You have to address that problem.

144
00:05:57.338 --> 00:05:59.218
Otherwise you just keep covering it up.

145
00:05:59.218 --> 00:06:02.018
When you cover up enough problems with enough pills,

146
00:06:02.018 --> 00:06:03.658
one day you'll go to your doctor

147
00:06:03.658 --> 00:06:05.058
and he'll say you have cancer

148
00:06:05.058 --> 00:06:06.578
or Parkinson's or something

149
00:06:06.578 --> 00:06:08.598
and you'll say, "Doctor, how did this happen?"

150
00:06:08.598 --> 00:06:10.418
They say, "We don't know.

151
00:06:10.418 --> 00:06:12.198
"These things just happen," but they don't.

152
00:06:12.198 --> 00:06:14.978
The person has done it to himself or herself

153
00:06:14.978 --> 00:06:18.218
over a long period of time by ignoring the symptoms

154
00:06:18.218 --> 00:06:20.138
and covering them up with drugs.

155
00:06:20.138 --> 00:06:22.418
So we've got this huge industry.

156
00:06:22.418 --> 00:06:27.418
If you look, our economy is largely run

157
00:06:27.518 --> 00:06:30.968
on the benefits of disease.

158
00:06:31.878 --> 00:06:34.858
We have medical schools,

159
00:06:34.858 --> 00:06:37.818
it costs a lot of money to go there.

160
00:06:37.818 --> 00:06:39.978
We have nursing schools,

161
00:06:39.978 --> 00:06:43.218
we have hospitals, we have drugs,

162
00:06:43.218 --> 00:06:45.918
we have all the surgical equipment,

163
00:06:45.918 --> 00:06:49.278
we have the walks for AIDS,

164
00:06:49.278 --> 00:06:52.378
walks for cancer, breast cancer,

165
00:06:52.378 --> 00:06:56.998
we have all of these fundraising things.

166
00:06:56.998 --> 00:06:59.378
The rich and famous and even

167
00:06:59.378 --> 00:07:01.278
the not-so-rich and not-so-famous

168
00:07:01.278 --> 00:07:03.698
have fundraisers for disease.

169
00:07:03.698 --> 00:07:05.758
Disease is great, you know?

170
00:07:05.758 --> 00:07:08.318
We can have a fundraiser for Parkinson's.

171
00:07:08.318 --> 00:07:11.538
Michael J. Fox has a whole foundation

172
00:07:11.538 --> 00:07:14.698
and all these doctors are making a lot of money

173
00:07:14.698 --> 00:07:17.458
with this research money and they're collecting money.

174
00:07:17.458 --> 00:07:20.618
They are never going to find a cure for Parkinson's

175
00:07:20.618 --> 00:07:23.078
because they are going the wrong direction.

176
00:07:23.078 --> 00:07:26.138
They are looking for it in the genes or anything else.

177
00:07:26.138 --> 00:07:29.218
I actually saw Michael J. Fox being interviewed,

178
00:07:29.218 --> 00:07:31.498
where he actually had, in his hand,

179
00:07:31.498 --> 00:07:34.558
a can of diet soda,

180
00:07:34.558 --> 00:07:37.518
which is one of the things that causes Parkinson's.

181
00:07:37.518 --> 00:07:40.178
And he could hardly hold it in his hand

182
00:07:40.178 --> 00:07:42.778
as he drinks it, and he doesn't realize

183
00:07:42.778 --> 00:07:45.818
that that is contributing to his Parkinson's.

184
00:07:45.818 --> 00:07:47.438
So these are the kinds of things

185
00:07:47.438 --> 00:07:49.238
where people are just so ignorant.

186
00:07:49.238 --> 00:07:51.038
I don't care how much money they have.

187
00:07:51.038 --> 00:07:52.318
They are ignorant.

188
00:07:52.318 --> 00:07:54.158
And the doctors are not advising them

189
00:07:54.158 --> 00:07:55.958
what to do because the doctors

190
00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.518
don't know themselves.

191
00:07:57.518 --> 00:07:59.678
The doctors are drinking the stuff.

192
00:07:59.678 --> 00:08:02.518
So this is an industry.

193
00:08:04.098 --> 00:08:08.505
Pharmaceutical companies give much of the funding

194
00:08:08.505 --> 00:08:11.885
for research at hospitals and medical centers

195
00:08:11.885 --> 00:08:13.805
and medical schools.

196
00:08:13.805 --> 00:08:16.225
And so, therefore, they have a big say

197
00:08:16.225 --> 00:08:18.745
in what is taught to medical students.

198
00:08:18.745 --> 00:08:21.725
And medical students are taught drugs and surgery.

199
00:08:21.725 --> 00:08:23.065
And that's it.

200
00:08:23.065 --> 00:08:25.065
They are not taught how to get people well

201
00:08:25.065 --> 00:08:26.585
by natural methods.

202
00:08:26.585 --> 00:08:28.165
Now some alternative methods

203
00:08:28.165 --> 00:08:30.425
are creeping into the medical schools,

204
00:08:30.425 --> 00:08:32.245
but they're not the things that I have

205
00:08:32.245 --> 00:08:34.545
talked about previously.

206
00:08:34.545 --> 00:08:37.725
They are crystals and hypnosis.

207
00:08:37.725 --> 00:08:41.425
Well there's no disease caused by a lack of hypnosis.

208
00:08:41.425 --> 00:08:44.925
There just isn't any disease caused by that.

209
00:08:44.925 --> 00:08:46.925
There's no disease caused by

210
00:08:46.925 --> 00:08:49.325
a lack of acupuncture.

211
00:08:49.325 --> 00:08:51.545
Disease is caused by the way we eat

212
00:08:51.545 --> 00:08:53.125
and the way we live.

213
00:08:53.125 --> 00:08:55.225
And so acupuncture seems to help

214
00:08:55.225 --> 00:08:57.045
some people short-term,

215
00:08:57.045 --> 00:08:59.265
but that is not the answer to disease.

216
00:08:59.265 --> 00:09:02.605
If you are going to take your car to a mechanic,

217
00:09:02.605 --> 00:09:04.985
you would never leave your car with a mechanic

218
00:09:04.985 --> 00:09:07.445
who says, "I'm never gonna find out what's wrong,

219
00:09:07.445 --> 00:09:10.525
"but I will fix it anyway by taking out the part."

220
00:09:10.525 --> 00:09:12.385
All right, you wouldn't do that.

221
00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.705
And yet doctors admit that they don't know

222
00:09:14.705 --> 00:09:16.205
what's wrong with you.

223
00:09:16.205 --> 00:09:17.245
They really don't know.

224
00:09:17.245 --> 00:09:18.525
They can give it a name,

225
00:09:18.525 --> 00:09:20.165
but if you look in medical textbooks,

226
00:09:20.165 --> 00:09:22.065
or which I have many here,

227
00:09:22.065 --> 00:09:26.065
you will see there is no place for etiology anymore.

228
00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:28.365
Etiology means the cause

229
00:09:28.365 --> 00:09:30.285
of this particular disease.

230
00:09:30.285 --> 00:09:32.445
Doctors admit that they don't know the cause is

231
00:09:32.445 --> 00:09:34.925
of over 90% of diseases.

232
00:09:34.925 --> 00:09:37.825
And yet they tell you they'll treat you for it.

233
00:09:37.825 --> 00:09:39.605
Well, how can they treat you for it

234
00:09:39.605 --> 00:09:41.325
if they don't know what causes it?

235
00:09:41.325 --> 00:09:43.405
They only cover up the symptoms,

236
00:09:43.405 --> 00:09:46.025
which eventually causes more problems.

237
00:09:46.025 --> 00:09:48.505
So it is a huge industry.

238
00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:53.165
The American Cancer Society,

239
00:09:53.165 --> 00:09:56.425
in their original charter, it says

240
00:09:56.425 --> 00:09:58.525
that they must disband the day

241
00:09:58.525 --> 00:10:00.705
a cancer cure is found.

242
00:10:00.705 --> 00:10:02.245
Well--
<v Regina>There's motivation</v>

243
00:10:02.245 --> 00:10:03.365
not to find it.

244
00:10:03.365 --> 00:10:04.905
<v ->That's correct, that's correct.</v>

245
00:10:04.905 --> 00:10:07.445
The cures for cancer are well-known.

246
00:10:07.445 --> 00:10:09.805
I just told you the cure for cancer.

247
00:10:09.805 --> 00:10:11.165
We've gotta stop doing the things

248
00:10:11.165 --> 00:10:13.285
that cause cancer and those things are known.

249
00:10:13.285 --> 00:10:14.565
<v Regina>And when you say this,</v>

250
00:10:14.565 --> 00:10:16.005
you're obviously attacked.

251
00:10:16.005 --> 00:10:18.525
You have been attacked on numerous occasions

252
00:10:18.525 --> 00:10:20.285
by the medical industry and

253
00:10:20.285 --> 00:10:21.565
their organizations.
<v Lorraine>Oh of course.</v>

254
00:10:21.565 --> 00:10:23.945
Because there are more people who make their living

255
00:10:23.945 --> 00:10:25.765
off of the cancer industry

256
00:10:25.765 --> 00:10:28.385
than people who have cancer.

257
00:10:28.385 --> 00:10:31.185
Okay? So there is no motivation

258
00:10:31.185 --> 00:10:33.205
to stop cancer.

259
00:10:33.205 --> 00:10:35.425
Besides that, I'm not saying

260
00:10:35.425 --> 00:10:38.065
that all of these people are evil and sinister.

261
00:10:38.065 --> 00:10:42.085
Your doctor is not trying to keep you sick, necessarily.

262
00:10:42.085 --> 00:10:45.065
Your doctor doesn't know hot to get you well

263
00:10:45.065 --> 00:10:46.845
because he or she was never taught.

264
00:10:46.845 --> 00:10:48.485
I was never taught.

265
00:10:48.485 --> 00:10:51.485
The only way I learned was studying on my own

266
00:10:51.485 --> 00:10:53.725
and searching the literature on my own.

267
00:10:53.725 --> 00:10:56.145
When I realized, as a doctor,

268
00:10:56.145 --> 00:10:58.305
that doctors don't have the answer

269
00:10:58.305 --> 00:10:59.585
and that I was going to have to

270
00:10:59.585 --> 00:11:01.325
find it out a different way.

271
00:11:01.325 --> 00:11:03.205
And I learned how to get well

272
00:11:03.205 --> 00:11:05.145
and I was not healed miraculously.

273
00:11:05.145 --> 00:11:07.265
I didn't just stand there and pray to God

274
00:11:07.265 --> 00:11:09.165
and then suddenly, or get in a prayer line.

275
00:11:09.165 --> 00:11:11.825
and get hit on the head, I don't believe in that.

276
00:11:11.825 --> 00:11:14.005
I believe miracles can happen.

277
00:11:14.005 --> 00:11:16.645
But if I just told you to sit around

278
00:11:16.645 --> 00:11:18.945
and wait for a miracle, what would that do?

279
00:11:18.945 --> 00:11:21.385
There is a way for everybody to get well

280
00:11:21.385 --> 00:11:23.585
from every disease.

281
00:11:23.585 --> 00:11:26.585
And so, if they just do it.

282
00:11:26.585 --> 00:11:29.585
But people have become so weak

283
00:11:31.295 --> 00:11:33.785
and this whole industry,

284
00:11:33.785 --> 00:11:37.925
even the department stores and others

285
00:11:37.925 --> 00:11:41.905
are making people weak in the following ways.

286
00:11:41.905 --> 00:11:44.885
You can buy a dress in a store

287
00:11:44.885 --> 00:11:48.245
and go and wear it a few times

288
00:11:48.245 --> 00:11:51.045
and then go take it back and say you don't like it.

289
00:11:51.045 --> 00:11:53.645
And frequently stores will give you your money back.

290
00:11:53.645 --> 00:11:55.245
Well that's making a weak individual

291
00:11:55.245 --> 00:11:57.465
because that person will not take responsibility

292
00:11:57.465 --> 00:11:59.485
for his or her actions.

293
00:12:01.135 --> 00:12:03.165
And so people are always saying,

294
00:12:03.165 --> 00:12:04.625
"Well I wanna try it and then

295
00:12:04.625 --> 00:12:06.565
"if I'll send it back if I don't like it."

296
00:12:06.565 --> 00:12:07.843
<v Regina>There's no integrity there.</v>

297
00:12:07.843 --> 00:12:09.243
<v ->There's no integrity there.</v>

298
00:12:09.243 --> 00:12:10.583
And people have to be willing

299
00:12:10.583 --> 00:12:13.103
to take responsibility for their own actions.

300
00:12:13.103 --> 00:12:15.683
And if you don't take responsibility,

301
00:12:15.683 --> 00:12:17.563
you're not going to get well.

302
00:12:17.563 --> 00:12:19.463
So the American Cancer Society,

303
00:12:19.463 --> 00:12:24.323
65% of the money they collect

304
00:12:24.323 --> 00:12:28.143
goes to pay executive salaries

305
00:12:28.143 --> 00:12:30.703
and the help and things like that.

306
00:12:30.703 --> 00:12:33.743
Only 5% actually goes for

307
00:12:33.743 --> 00:12:36.143
funding for patient care.

308
00:12:36.143 --> 00:12:37.843
And there has never been

309
00:12:37.843 --> 00:12:40.963
any major advance in cancer

310
00:12:40.963 --> 00:12:45.523
by studies funded by the American Cancer Society.

311
00:12:45.523 --> 00:12:47.083
Ever.

312
00:12:47.083 --> 00:12:51.563
And again, all they're looking for is drugs.

313
00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:53.781
And they're now looking in the genes.

314
00:12:53.781 --> 00:12:55.681
They say cancer is genetic.

315
00:12:55.681 --> 00:12:59.101
Well if cancer were genetic then our grandmothers,

316
00:12:59.101 --> 00:13:01.761
let's just say breast cancer.

317
00:13:01.761 --> 00:13:04.661
Our grandmothers would have as much or more

318
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:07.921
cancer of the breast than we do.

319
00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:09.881
If it's genetic.

320
00:13:09.881 --> 00:13:12.251
Because then it has to come from somewhere.

321
00:13:12.251 --> 00:13:14.256
But you will see that they did not

322
00:13:14.256 --> 00:13:15.636
have breast cancer.

323
00:13:15.636 --> 00:13:17.416
And so it is not in the genes.

324
00:13:17.416 --> 00:13:20.296
<v Regina>Bruce Lipton says this a lot in his work.</v>

325
00:13:20.296 --> 00:13:23.756
<v ->All you have to do is look at the women in Japan</v>

326
00:13:23.756 --> 00:13:25.436
who are 70 years old

327
00:13:25.436 --> 00:13:27.756
and who eat mainly rice and vegetables

328
00:13:27.756 --> 00:13:31.356
and a small amount of fish or animal products.

329
00:13:31.356 --> 00:13:34.656
And they have a very low incidence of breast cancer.

330
00:13:34.656 --> 00:13:37.716
You bring them to America, those same women,

331
00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:39.076
you bring them to America,

332
00:13:39.076 --> 00:13:41.436
give them a rich Western diet

333
00:13:41.436 --> 00:13:44.596
and the rapid-pace lifestyle

334
00:13:44.596 --> 00:13:46.736
and they will have the same incidence

335
00:13:46.736 --> 00:13:49.056
of breast cancer that American women do.

336
00:13:49.056 --> 00:13:52.256
It shows you clearly that it is not genetic.

337
00:13:52.256 --> 00:13:53.996
There are very few genetic diseases.

338
00:13:53.996 --> 00:13:56.756
There are a few, but there are very few.

339
00:13:56.756 --> 00:14:00.116
And most of it is by the way we eat

340
00:14:00.116 --> 00:14:01.356
and the way we live.

341
00:14:01.356 --> 00:14:02.696
And that is what causes cancer.

342
00:14:02.696 --> 00:14:05.396
Our ancestors had a very low incidence of cancer

343
00:14:05.396 --> 00:14:06.476
compared to us.

344
00:14:06.476 --> 00:14:09.136
So then how could it be passed down in the genes?

345
00:14:09.136 --> 00:14:11.996
It's passed down in families,

346
00:14:11.996 --> 00:14:13.616
but not in the genes.

347
00:14:13.616 --> 00:14:15.476
It's because grandmother teaches mother

348
00:14:15.476 --> 00:14:17.456
how to eat, live and handle stress,

349
00:14:17.456 --> 00:14:19.056
and mother teaches daughter.

350
00:14:19.056 --> 00:14:21.116
And if you keep doing that,

351
00:14:21.116 --> 00:14:23.356
if you have a family history of cancer

352
00:14:23.356 --> 00:14:25.096
and you keep eating and living

353
00:14:25.096 --> 00:14:27.136
the way your family eats and lives,

354
00:14:27.136 --> 00:14:28.636
you'll get cancer too.

355
00:14:28.636 --> 00:14:29.796
Or some other disease.

356
00:14:29.796 --> 00:14:31.696
All you have to do to avoid that

357
00:14:31.696 --> 00:14:34.176
is change the way you're eating and living

358
00:14:34.176 --> 00:14:36.456
from the way your ancestors,

359
00:14:36.456 --> 00:14:38.536
your mother or your grandmother,

360
00:14:38.536 --> 00:14:39.676
eats and lives.

361
00:14:39.676 --> 00:14:41.056
So you don't have to worry about it.

362
00:14:41.056 --> 00:14:43.096
It's great peace of mind to realize

363
00:14:43.096 --> 00:14:44.856
there is an answer.

364
00:14:44.856 --> 00:14:46.956
You don't have to go to the white coats.

365
00:14:46.956 --> 00:14:50.216
So I talked about we have all these

366
00:14:50.216 --> 00:14:52.656
walks for cancer, Parkinson's,

367
00:14:52.656 --> 00:14:53.916
everything--
<v Regina>And it's stylish</v>

368
00:14:53.916 --> 00:14:55.106
to wear pink ribbons.

369
00:14:55.106 --> 00:14:56.556
<v ->Oh, right, it's stylish.</v>

370
00:14:56.556 --> 00:14:58.576
And whenever I go through the grocery store line

371
00:14:58.576 --> 00:15:00.356
and they say, "Wouldn't you like to contribute

372
00:15:00.356 --> 00:15:02.376
"to this?" it gives me a wonderful time

373
00:15:02.376 --> 00:15:04.336
to share this with someone.

374
00:15:04.336 --> 00:15:06.556
I say, "The cure for cancer is known."

375
00:15:06.556 --> 00:15:08.356
And then I show them my card

376
00:15:08.356 --> 00:15:09.796
with all the information on it

377
00:15:09.796 --> 00:15:11.296
and the tumor and all that.

378
00:15:11.296 --> 00:15:13.116
And I say, "The cure for cancer is known.

379
00:15:13.116 --> 00:15:15.676
"But, you see, the cure is free.

380
00:15:15.676 --> 00:15:18.616
"The cure is free, it doesn't make any money."

381
00:15:18.616 --> 00:15:21.596
I had some of my medical colleague friends

382
00:15:21.596 --> 00:15:23.776
from San Francisco tell me one time,

383
00:15:23.776 --> 00:15:25.376
"Look, I wanna help you out.

384
00:15:25.376 --> 00:15:27.636
"This will never fly if doctors

385
00:15:27.636 --> 00:15:29.636
"can't make money on it."

386
00:15:29.636 --> 00:15:33.716
Well we don't need to go to doctors for these,

387
00:15:33.716 --> 00:15:35.516
for chronic diseases.

388
00:15:35.516 --> 00:15:37.376
We can be healthy because

389
00:15:37.376 --> 00:15:41.416
there are not even methods of prevention in medicine.

390
00:15:41.416 --> 00:15:43.856
They talk about, "We'll prevent you from cancer.

391
00:15:43.856 --> 00:15:45.436
"Get a PAP smear,

392
00:15:45.436 --> 00:15:48.076
"get a mammogram."

393
00:15:48.076 --> 00:15:50.276
Well mammograms cause cancer

394
00:15:50.276 --> 00:15:52.036
because mammograms are radiation.

395
00:15:52.036 --> 00:15:54.256
Every time you get a mammogram

396
00:15:54.256 --> 00:15:57.396
you increase your risk of breast cancer by 2%.

397
00:15:57.396 --> 00:16:00.556
So if a woman who's post-menopausal

398
00:16:00.556 --> 00:16:03.036
is told by her doctor she needs a mammogram

399
00:16:03.036 --> 00:16:05.096
maybe every six months,

400
00:16:05.096 --> 00:16:08.076
she has increased her risk of getting cancer

401
00:16:08.076 --> 00:16:10.236
by 20% over 10 years.

402
00:16:10.236 --> 00:16:12.746
The exact disease she doesn't want to get.

403
00:16:12.746 --> 00:16:15.076
This is not prevention, mammograms are not prevention.

404
00:16:15.076 --> 00:16:17.418
They actually contribute to cancer.

405
00:16:17.418 --> 00:16:20.058
PAP smears don't prevent cancer.

406
00:16:20.058 --> 00:16:22.018
They tell you when you have it.

407
00:16:22.018 --> 00:16:23.838
So then the doctor can give you chemo,

408
00:16:23.838 --> 00:16:26.018
radiation or cut something out.

409
00:16:26.018 --> 00:16:27.928
It doesn't work.

410
00:16:29.898 --> 00:16:33.838
Other kinds of supposedly prevention,

411
00:16:33.838 --> 00:16:35.178
they're not prevention.

412
00:16:35.178 --> 00:16:37.958
They only tell you when you have the disease.

413
00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.178
The things that I'm talking about

414
00:16:40.178 --> 00:16:41.618
are real prevention.

415
00:16:41.618 --> 00:16:43.318
Change the way you eat.

416
00:16:43.318 --> 00:16:44.538
Start exercising.

417
00:16:44.538 --> 00:16:47.718
A woman can reduce her risk of breast cancer

418
00:16:47.718 --> 00:16:52.358
by 66% by one thing that's totally free.

419
00:16:52.358 --> 00:16:56.058
And that's four hours of exercise per week.

420
00:16:56.058 --> 00:17:00.558
Four hours, that's one hour four days a week.

421
00:17:00.558 --> 00:17:02.898
She can reduce her risk of breast cancer

422
00:17:02.898 --> 00:17:05.998
by 66% and it's totally free.

423
00:17:05.998 --> 00:17:07.455
<v Regina>And does that include something as simple</v>

424
00:17:07.455 --> 00:17:09.435
as going out for a brisk walk for an hour?

425
00:17:09.435 --> 00:17:10.875
<v ->That's right, a walk.</v>

426
00:17:10.875 --> 00:17:11.755
A walk.

427
00:17:11.755 --> 00:17:12.935
You don't have to do anything more

428
00:17:12.935 --> 00:17:14.635
than a brisk walk for an hour

429
00:17:14.635 --> 00:17:16.915
and that will reduce your risk of breast cancer

430
00:17:16.915 --> 00:17:18.515
by 66%.

431
00:17:18.515 --> 00:17:21.135
The medical profession never popularized

432
00:17:21.135 --> 00:17:22.675
that piece of information.

433
00:17:22.675 --> 00:17:24.755
Doctors, most doctors, don't even know it.

434
00:17:24.755 --> 00:17:26.695
Do you know who popularized that?

435
00:17:26.695 --> 00:17:28.535
They were right, but it's only 'cause

436
00:17:28.535 --> 00:17:30.355
they could make money off of it.

437
00:17:30.355 --> 00:17:32.995
Nike shoes, you see.

438
00:17:32.995 --> 00:17:35.055
You just follow the money.

439
00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:36.235
Always follow the money.

440
00:17:36.235 --> 00:17:38.695
When you follow the money you can see

441
00:17:38.695 --> 00:17:41.355
how all of these things are just

442
00:17:41.355 --> 00:17:43.985
promoted by greed.

443
00:17:44.535 --> 00:17:46.155
<v Regina>Speaking of which,</v>

444
00:17:46.155 --> 00:17:48.015
let's move onto AIDS.

445
00:17:48.015 --> 00:17:51.615
<v ->AIDS, I got very involved with the AIDS epidemic</v>

446
00:17:51.615 --> 00:17:54.335
because, as a trauma surgeon in San Francisco,

447
00:17:54.335 --> 00:17:55.715
I was chief of the department

448
00:17:55.715 --> 00:17:57.495
at San Francisco General Hospital.

449
00:17:57.495 --> 00:18:01.295
And I recognized in 1981

450
00:18:01.295 --> 00:18:02.715
that there was a problem.

451
00:18:02.715 --> 00:18:04.475
However, the Centers for Disease Control,

452
00:18:04.475 --> 00:18:07.215
one of the main governmental health bodies

453
00:18:07.215 --> 00:18:08.415
in this country,

454
00:18:08.415 --> 00:18:09.735
kept telling me that I was

455
00:18:09.735 --> 00:18:12.115
worrying unnecessarily because AIDS

456
00:18:12.115 --> 00:18:15.035
could not be transmitted from human to human.

457
00:18:15.035 --> 00:18:17.475
That's what they said in 1981.

458
00:18:17.475 --> 00:18:21.415
So those who want to make science into their God

459
00:18:21.415 --> 00:18:24.615
will realize that science is constantly changing.

460
00:18:24.615 --> 00:18:27.195
But by about--
<v Regina>But doesn't that depend</v>

461
00:18:27.195 --> 00:18:30.795
on who's paying for the studies and research, of course.

462
00:18:30.795 --> 00:18:32.655
<v ->Oh, that's right, that's right.</v>

463
00:18:32.655 --> 00:18:35.595
As well as politics and being politically correct.

464
00:18:35.595 --> 00:18:39.255
By about 1985 or so,

465
00:18:39.255 --> 00:18:41.395
they realized that AIDS was being

466
00:18:41.395 --> 00:18:43.235
transferred in drug addicts and it could

467
00:18:43.235 --> 00:18:45.475
be transmitted through needles.

468
00:18:45.475 --> 00:18:48.255
I then talked to the Centers for Disease Control

469
00:18:48.255 --> 00:18:49.735
and our public health department.

470
00:18:49.735 --> 00:18:51.654
I said, "We in the operating room

471
00:18:51.654 --> 00:18:53.514
"get stuck with needles all the time.

472
00:18:53.514 --> 00:18:55.094
"It's not because we're clumsy,

473
00:18:55.094 --> 00:18:57.154
"but we get stuck with sharp shards of bone

474
00:18:57.154 --> 00:18:59.254
"from people who've been shot and run over

475
00:18:59.254 --> 00:19:01.874
"and this bone is all covered with blood

476
00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:03.514
"and it goes right through our gloves

477
00:19:03.514 --> 00:19:05.994
"because we have to wear very thin gloves

478
00:19:05.994 --> 00:19:07.974
"in order to feel what we're doing.

479
00:19:07.974 --> 00:19:09.394
"Latex gloves."

480
00:19:09.394 --> 00:19:11.614
"Oh," they said, "Drug addicts can get AIDS

481
00:19:11.614 --> 00:19:13.234
"from needle sticks,

482
00:19:13.234 --> 00:19:15.014
"but health care workers can't."

483
00:19:15.014 --> 00:19:16.514
<v Regina>Hello?</v>
<v Lorraine>Yes.</v>

484
00:19:16.514 --> 00:19:18.654
And I said, "Could you explain that to me?"

485
00:19:18.654 --> 00:19:21.814
And they said, "Well, drug addicts

486
00:19:21.814 --> 00:19:25.254
"use hollow-bore needles because they're injecting.

487
00:19:25.254 --> 00:19:27.436
"And doctors in the operating room

488
00:19:27.436 --> 00:19:29.976
"use solid-core-bore neeedles

489
00:19:29.976 --> 00:19:31.536
"because they're suture needles."

490
00:19:31.536 --> 00:19:33.816
I said, "Well you guys, you fellas

491
00:19:33.816 --> 00:19:35.956
"who are in the infectious disease department,

492
00:19:35.956 --> 00:19:38.396
"you're sitting in your offices in your white shirts

493
00:19:38.396 --> 00:19:40.996
"and ties and you never get any blood on you.

494
00:19:40.996 --> 00:19:43.116
"We get blood on us and we use

495
00:19:43.116 --> 00:19:46.116
"hollow-bore needles as well as solid."

496
00:19:46.116 --> 00:19:48.256
And I said, "Why can't you get it

497
00:19:48.256 --> 00:19:49.616
"from a solid-bore needle?"

498
00:19:49.616 --> 00:19:51.036
And they said, "Because there's not enough

499
00:19:51.036 --> 00:19:53.516
"AIDS virus on the needle to give you AIDS."

500
00:19:53.516 --> 00:19:55.516
And I said, "Then how you,

501
00:19:55.516 --> 00:19:57.836
"Obviously then you know how many AIDS viruses

502
00:19:57.836 --> 00:19:59.336
"it takes to give you AIDS.

503
00:19:59.336 --> 00:20:00.356
"How many does it take?"

504
00:20:00.356 --> 00:20:02.036
And they said, "We don't know."

505
00:20:02.036 --> 00:20:03.576
"So you're lying to me.

506
00:20:03.576 --> 00:20:05.176
"You're lying to me, you don't know.

507
00:20:05.176 --> 00:20:06.276
"You say there's not enough there,

508
00:20:06.276 --> 00:20:07.816
"but you don't know how much it takes

509
00:20:07.816 --> 00:20:09.516
"to give a person AIDS."

510
00:20:09.516 --> 00:20:13.416
So I found out, when I started speaking out about AIDS,

511
00:20:13.416 --> 00:20:15.816
because they had been telling me these lies

512
00:20:15.816 --> 00:20:19.156
for a long time, til October 2, 1987,

513
00:20:19.156 --> 00:20:21.156
when they finally admitted publicly,

514
00:20:21.156 --> 00:20:22.456
in the United States,

515
00:20:22.456 --> 00:20:27.456
that a nurse had gotten AIDS from a single needle stick.

516
00:20:27.496 --> 00:20:30.276
And it was a nurse at my hospital.

517
00:20:30.276 --> 00:20:31.876
So I was on the war path.

518
00:20:31.876 --> 00:20:33.976
And I said, "You know, it doesn't take

519
00:20:33.976 --> 00:20:35.476
"much common sense to realize that

520
00:20:35.476 --> 00:20:37.316
"if drug addicts can get it,

521
00:20:37.316 --> 00:20:39.116
"health care workers can too."

522
00:20:39.116 --> 00:20:40.396
But I didn't realize at that time

523
00:20:40.396 --> 00:20:41.956
that it was so political.

524
00:20:41.956 --> 00:20:44.206
And it was because of the very strong

525
00:20:44.206 --> 00:20:45.976
homosexual lobby that was influencing

526
00:20:45.976 --> 00:20:47.936
the drug companies, who were

527
00:20:47.936 --> 00:20:51.376
influencing the research funding and all that.

528
00:20:51.376 --> 00:20:54.396
And this was to be a politically correct thing.

529
00:20:54.396 --> 00:20:57.736
I was promoted on the idea that AIDS should be handled

530
00:20:57.736 --> 00:21:00.736
as any other sexually transmitted disease

531
00:21:00.736 --> 00:21:02.736
or any other contagious disease.

532
00:21:02.736 --> 00:21:05.036
They refused to do that because of the strength

533
00:21:05.036 --> 00:21:06.916
of the homosexual lobby.

534
00:21:06.916 --> 00:21:11.196
All I was asking for was for people to be tested

535
00:21:11.196 --> 00:21:14.136
as health care workers should be tested,

536
00:21:14.136 --> 00:21:15.896
and patients should be tested.

537
00:21:15.896 --> 00:21:18.416
So there would be some trust

538
00:21:18.416 --> 00:21:21.576
and some ability to

539
00:21:21.576 --> 00:21:26.106
use protected measures not to get the disease.

540
00:21:26.476 --> 00:21:29.196
But through this,

541
00:21:29.196 --> 00:21:31.436
when I started investigating it,

542
00:21:31.436 --> 00:21:34.536
I found out that AIDS is a man-made virus.

543
00:21:34.536 --> 00:21:36.896
It was meant for population control.

544
00:21:36.896 --> 00:21:38.896
It was put in certain vaccinations

545
00:21:38.896 --> 00:21:41.036
that were given to people in Africa,

546
00:21:41.036 --> 00:21:43.296
as well as to the homosexual population

547
00:21:43.296 --> 00:21:44.836
because then, of course,

548
00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:46.276
with their numerous sexual partners

549
00:21:46.276 --> 00:21:48.336
it would spread very rapidly.

550
00:21:48.336 --> 00:21:50.936
And AIDS can be used to

551
00:21:50.936 --> 00:21:53.616
wipe out the population in Africa.

552
00:21:53.616 --> 00:21:56.656
So groups that want to go in there,

553
00:21:56.656 --> 00:21:59.336
very high-level groups that want to go in there

554
00:21:59.336 --> 00:22:01.896
and take all the natural resources of the country

555
00:22:01.896 --> 00:22:03.416
can do so.

556
00:22:03.416 --> 00:22:05.716
So AIDS was a manufactured virus.

557
00:22:05.716 --> 00:22:07.736
<v Regina>Can you talk about that a little bit?</v>

558
00:22:07.736 --> 00:22:10.196
<v ->AIDS was a manufactured virus.</v>

559
00:22:10.196 --> 00:22:13.356
Probably made in Fort Detrick, Maryland,

560
00:22:13.356 --> 00:22:18.136
which is our biological warfare headquarters.

561
00:22:18.136 --> 00:22:21.006
In the military.

562
00:22:21.236 --> 00:22:26.156
And it probably was done by genetic engineering

563
00:22:26.156 --> 00:22:30.156
with half of the sheep maedi-visna virus

564
00:22:30.156 --> 00:22:33.516
and bovine leukemia virus.

565
00:22:33.516 --> 00:22:35.696
And you can put them together.

566
00:22:35.696 --> 00:22:38.676
Any technician that knows how to do this can do it.

567
00:22:38.676 --> 00:22:41.556
And then you grow it in human cell culture

568
00:22:41.556 --> 00:22:44.156
to make humans susceptible to it,

569
00:22:44.156 --> 00:22:46.356
and there you've got your AIDS virus.

570
00:22:46.356 --> 00:22:47.746
<v Regina>It wasn't a monkey biting virus?</v>

571
00:22:47.746 --> 00:22:49.436
<v ->No, it had nothing to do with monkeys.</v>

572
00:22:49.436 --> 00:22:51.736
The way that monkeys were found

573
00:22:51.736 --> 00:22:52.936
with it in Africa.

574
00:22:52.936 --> 00:22:55.816
First of all, monkeys generally don't live in the city.

575
00:22:55.816 --> 00:22:57.496
They live in the country,

576
00:22:57.496 --> 00:22:59.836
but AIDS started in the cities in Africa,

577
00:22:59.836 --> 00:23:01.756
so you can tell that,

578
00:23:01.756 --> 00:23:03.616
how that happened.

579
00:23:03.616 --> 00:23:07.136
And then monkeys were actually used

580
00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:09.036
for experiments.

581
00:23:09.036 --> 00:23:11.036
And then they were released back

582
00:23:11.036 --> 00:23:13.176
into the wild in Africa, where they were

583
00:23:13.176 --> 00:23:14.976
already given the AIDS virus.

584
00:23:14.976 --> 00:23:16.416
And so then it was wonderful.

585
00:23:16.416 --> 00:23:18.776
They could come up with this monkey with AIDS.

586
00:23:18.776 --> 00:23:21.996
You'll notice that when any of these diseases come along,

587
00:23:21.996 --> 00:23:25.264
like we had the swine flu, which was a total hoax.

588
00:23:25.454 --> 00:23:28.214
And they made a vaccination for the swine flu

589
00:23:28.214 --> 00:23:31.134
in the early 70s or 80s.

590
00:23:31.134 --> 00:23:33.494
And over 800 people,

591
00:23:33.494 --> 00:23:35.034
there were a number of people who

592
00:23:35.034 --> 00:23:36.214
died from the vaccine.

593
00:23:36.214 --> 00:23:38.594
And it was a total hoax, there was no such disease.

594
00:23:38.594 --> 00:23:42.086
But it was a plan for the pharmaceutical companies

595
00:23:42.086 --> 00:23:45.746
to make a vaccine, scare everybody into taking it,

596
00:23:45.746 --> 00:23:50.066
but over 800 people developed Guillain-Barré syndrome,

597
00:23:50.066 --> 00:23:54.526
which is a paralysis that can actually go

598
00:23:54.526 --> 00:23:57.006
high enough in your body to stop you from breathing

599
00:23:57.006 --> 00:23:58.446
and you die.

600
00:23:58.446 --> 00:24:01.786
So this was a total hoax.

601
00:24:01.786 --> 00:24:04.966
And presently we have another total hoax,

602
00:24:04.966 --> 00:24:06.926
which is the bird flu.

603
00:24:06.926 --> 00:24:09.086
If you go on my website,

604
00:24:09.086 --> 00:24:10.726
I have another website called

605
00:24:10.726 --> 00:24:13.126
goodnewsaboutgod.com.

606
00:24:13.126 --> 00:24:15.726
And if you click on table of topics

607
00:24:15.726 --> 00:24:18.506
you will see a whole article about bird flu,

608
00:24:18.506 --> 00:24:21.686
where I show, from the Centers for Disease Control

609
00:24:21.686 --> 00:24:23.606
and the World Health Organization,

610
00:24:23.606 --> 00:24:26.686
that it is impossible to detect bird flu

611
00:24:26.686 --> 00:24:28.586
from regular flu.

612
00:24:28.586 --> 00:24:33.586
The symptoms are so non-specific.

613
00:24:35.446 --> 00:24:40.446
It's like a cough and a fever of 100.4.

614
00:24:40.766 --> 00:24:43.266
Well you can get that on a hot day.

615
00:24:43.266 --> 00:24:46.146
When I was an intern at San Francisco General Hospital,

616
00:24:46.146 --> 00:24:48.526
we all hated hot days in San Francisco

617
00:24:48.526 --> 00:24:49.966
'cause it's usually cool.

618
00:24:49.966 --> 00:24:52.328
Because then every patient would

619
00:24:52.328 --> 00:24:53.948
develop a mild fever.

620
00:24:53.948 --> 00:24:55.788
We'd have to go do a fever workup,

621
00:24:55.788 --> 00:24:56.868
draw blood, look up this.

622
00:24:56.868 --> 00:24:59.008
We knew it was just the hot day, you see.

623
00:24:59.008 --> 00:25:00.368
<v Regina>Because there's not of air conditioning</v>

624
00:25:00.368 --> 00:25:01.608
in San Francisco.
<v Lorraine>That's right.</v>

625
00:25:01.608 --> 00:25:04.108
And so a temperature of 100.4

626
00:25:04.108 --> 00:25:06.828
is virtually no temperature at all.

627
00:25:06.828 --> 00:25:09.488
And so when they start talking about these things

628
00:25:09.488 --> 00:25:11.368
and they say this is a disease.

629
00:25:11.368 --> 00:25:13.868
Bird flu is nothing but SARS with wings.

630
00:25:13.868 --> 00:25:15.708
SARS was a hoax.

631
00:25:15.708 --> 00:25:19.428
It again has these non-specific symptoms.

632
00:25:19.428 --> 00:25:24.428
But what do they gain by manufacturing this terror?

633
00:25:25.488 --> 00:25:27.188
They gain control.

634
00:25:27.188 --> 00:25:28.888
Because they could quarantine

635
00:25:28.888 --> 00:25:31.348
whole cities with SARS.

636
00:25:31.348 --> 00:25:34.948
They can quarantine airplane loads of passengers.

637
00:25:34.948 --> 00:25:38.068
They can make vaccines for them

638
00:25:38.068 --> 00:25:40.668
and demand that everyone take it,

639
00:25:40.668 --> 00:25:43.008
which is absolutely--
<v Regina>It's frightening.</v>

640
00:25:43.008 --> 00:25:45.728
<v ->It frightens everybody, plus they put</v>

641
00:25:45.728 --> 00:25:48.468
things in vaccines, in vaccinations

642
00:25:48.468 --> 00:25:52.228
there are preservatives like formaldehyde.

643
00:25:52.228 --> 00:25:56.226
It's grown in either animal or human cells,

644
00:25:56.226 --> 00:25:59.286
all of which have contaminants in them.

645
00:25:59.286 --> 00:26:03.886
And so vaccinations are very damaging to individuals.

646
00:26:03.886 --> 00:26:06.066
We can talk more about that later.

647
00:26:06.066 --> 00:26:08.746
But they are an absolute financial boon

648
00:26:08.746 --> 00:26:11.206
to the pharmaceutical companies.

649
00:26:11.206 --> 00:26:13.386
And here you manufacture a disease

650
00:26:13.386 --> 00:26:17.201
or you manufacture just the

651
00:26:17.201 --> 00:26:19.826
propoganda that there is a disease.

652
00:26:19.826 --> 00:26:21.766
And then you demand that everybody

653
00:26:21.766 --> 00:26:24.146
take this vaccine

654
00:26:24.146 --> 00:26:26.826
and then you get the government to pay for it,

655
00:26:26.826 --> 00:26:29.566
which comes out of the taxpayer's pocket.

656
00:26:29.566 --> 00:26:32.626
And so you can make billions on these.

657
00:26:32.626 --> 00:26:35.406
Plus it causes a lot of damage

658
00:26:35.406 --> 00:26:37.986
to the immune system

659
00:26:37.986 --> 00:26:40.226
of the human beings who get it

660
00:26:40.226 --> 00:26:42.006
and then you've got more business

661
00:26:42.006 --> 00:26:43.666
for the medical industry.

662
00:26:43.666 --> 00:26:46.086
<v Regina>Now I want to just bring something up</v>

663
00:26:46.086 --> 00:26:47.866
I had read in one of your articles.

664
00:26:47.866 --> 00:26:50.246
That you had actually called, as a doctor,

665
00:26:50.246 --> 00:26:53.506
to find out from, was it the Centers for Disease Control?

666
00:26:53.506 --> 00:26:55.186
<v ->Centers for Disease Control.</v>

667
00:26:55.186 --> 00:26:56.746
<v Regina>What the symptoms were.</v>

668
00:26:56.746 --> 00:26:59.666
How the symptoms differed to a regular flu.

669
00:26:59.666 --> 00:27:00.966
And what did you find?

670
00:27:00.966 --> 00:27:01.641
<v ->That's right.</v>

671
00:27:01.641 --> 00:27:04.381
And I talked to a doctor in the bird flu division.

672
00:27:04.381 --> 00:27:06.281
And he agreed with me that,

673
00:27:06.281 --> 00:27:08.601
on the symptoms, you cannot tell the difference.

674
00:27:08.601 --> 00:27:10.941
And so I said, "Well then, the president

675
00:27:10.941 --> 00:27:14.341
"is talking about bringing out the miliary

676
00:27:14.341 --> 00:27:16.441
"and quarantining people."

677
00:27:16.441 --> 00:27:18.981
And he said to me, "That's all political.

678
00:27:18.981 --> 00:27:20.961
"It has nothing to do with us."

679
00:27:20.961 --> 00:27:22.901
But then, on top of that,

680
00:27:22.901 --> 00:27:25.721
Dr. Julie Gerberding, who is now head

681
00:27:25.721 --> 00:27:28.421
of the Centers for Disease Control,

682
00:27:28.421 --> 00:27:30.901
has said, "Oh now, this is not a hoax.

683
00:27:30.901 --> 00:27:33.481
"This is really a problem and we've got

684
00:27:33.481 --> 00:27:35.701
"to have vaccines and all that."

685
00:27:35.701 --> 00:27:38.041
Well, I guess I can say right here,

686
00:27:38.041 --> 00:27:39.721
and I'll say it publicly.

687
00:27:39.721 --> 00:27:42.521
I know Julie Gerberding from way back.

688
00:27:42.521 --> 00:27:44.641
Julie Gerberding was at San Francisco

689
00:27:44.641 --> 00:27:46.501
General Hospital when I was.

690
00:27:46.501 --> 00:27:48.981
She was in the infectious disease department.

691
00:27:48.981 --> 00:27:51.321
I was in the orthopedic department.

692
00:27:51.321 --> 00:27:54.421
When I started speaking out about AIDS,

693
00:27:54.421 --> 00:27:57.821
the infectious disease department that was

694
00:27:57.821 --> 00:27:59.661
run by the medical department,

695
00:27:59.661 --> 00:28:02.741
all those people were told not to talk to me anymore

696
00:28:02.741 --> 00:28:05.081
because I was willing to say publicly

697
00:28:05.081 --> 00:28:06.641
what the truth was.

698
00:28:06.641 --> 00:28:08.681
So they were ordered not to talk to me and tell me

699
00:28:08.681 --> 00:28:11.661
anything that was going on in their department.

700
00:28:11.661 --> 00:28:15.261
The first television show I was ever on about AIDS

701
00:28:15.261 --> 00:28:18.001
was a local television show in San Francisco.

702
00:28:18.001 --> 00:28:20.941
Julie and I were on there together.

703
00:28:20.941 --> 00:28:22.621
At that point,

704
00:28:22.621 --> 00:28:25.621
everybody in medicine, including

705
00:28:25.621 --> 00:28:27.881
Centers for Disease Control,

706
00:28:27.881 --> 00:28:30.976
believed that AIDS was 100% fatal.

707
00:28:30.976 --> 00:28:33.436
I said that on television.

708
00:28:33.436 --> 00:28:36.496
Julie said that's not true.

709
00:28:36.496 --> 00:28:39.196
<v Regina>You said what on television?</v>

710
00:28:39.196 --> 00:28:42.316
<v ->I said AIDS was 100% fatal.</v>

711
00:28:42.316 --> 00:28:45.296
That was the knowledge that we had a that time

712
00:28:45.296 --> 00:28:46.276
and it was true.

713
00:28:46.276 --> 00:28:47.576
Everybody died.

714
00:28:47.576 --> 00:28:51.176
And Julie refuted that, she said that's not true.

715
00:28:51.176 --> 00:28:54.996
And I said to her, "How could you say such a thing?

716
00:28:54.996 --> 00:28:57.376
"How could you say," after the show.

717
00:28:57.376 --> 00:28:59.996
I waited for her and I said, "Julie,

718
00:28:59.996 --> 00:29:02.616
"you know that, we all know that

719
00:29:02.616 --> 00:29:04.536
"this is 100% fatal."

720
00:29:04.536 --> 00:29:06.516
<v ->She said, "I know.</v>

721
00:29:06.516 --> 00:29:08.456
"But we have to worry about the psyche

722
00:29:08.456 --> 00:29:10.496
"of the AIDS patient."

723
00:29:10.496 --> 00:29:12.156
I said, "You would lie

724
00:29:12.156 --> 00:29:14.856
"to the rest of the world for that?"

725
00:29:14.856 --> 00:29:18.396
And she said yes and turned and walked away.

726
00:29:18.396 --> 00:29:21.916
So she was willing not to tell the truth

727
00:29:21.916 --> 00:29:24.156
about what we understood about that disease

728
00:29:24.156 --> 00:29:25.296
at that time.

729
00:29:25.296 --> 00:29:27.216
What I realized later was

730
00:29:27.216 --> 00:29:29.043
the homosexual community would pick at

731
00:29:29.043 --> 00:29:31.163
the pharmaceutical companies if they gave

732
00:29:31.163 --> 00:29:35.323
funding to anybody who was for routine testing

733
00:29:35.323 --> 00:29:37.263
and anything like that.

734
00:29:37.263 --> 00:29:39.323
So she was being politically correct,

735
00:29:39.323 --> 00:29:41.723
apparently, so they could get more funding.

736
00:29:41.723 --> 00:29:45.443
Now she is now the head of

737
00:29:45.443 --> 00:29:48.043
the Centers for Disease Control.

738
00:29:48.043 --> 00:29:50.543
So she has been willing, in the past,

739
00:29:50.543 --> 00:29:53.563
to pervert the truth, misrepresent it.

740
00:29:53.563 --> 00:29:55.783
And now I have no reason to believe

741
00:29:55.783 --> 00:29:58.503
that she would not still do the same thing.

742
00:29:58.503 --> 00:30:01.603
So this is the kind of thing that,

743
00:30:01.603 --> 00:30:04.913
(mumbles)

744
00:30:05.503 --> 00:30:10.103
so this is the kind of thing that we see where

745
00:30:10.103 --> 00:30:14.323
major governmental organizations are willing

746
00:30:14.323 --> 00:30:18.803
to cover up the truth for political gain.

747
00:30:18.803 --> 00:30:21.823
And also for financial gain.

748
00:30:21.823 --> 00:30:24.143
There is almost an open door

749
00:30:24.143 --> 00:30:27.393
between the

750
00:30:28.103 --> 00:30:30.063
Centers for Disease Control

751
00:30:30.063 --> 00:30:32.003
and the pharmaceutical companies

752
00:30:32.003 --> 00:30:34.723
and the vaccination industry and all that.

753
00:30:34.723 --> 00:30:37.283
<v Regina>So going back to the subject of,</v>

754
00:30:37.283 --> 00:30:40.703
let's hop back to

755
00:30:40.703 --> 00:30:42.313
AIDS also, bird flu

756
00:30:42.313 --> 00:30:45.373
and mandatory vaccinations.

757
00:30:45.883 --> 00:30:49.023
Vaccinations, I've read some of Len Horowitz's work.

758
00:30:49.023 --> 00:30:50.563
He's done some really good work.

759
00:30:50.563 --> 00:30:53.663
This is really becoming a very frightening subject.

760
00:30:53.663 --> 00:30:54.603
<v ->That's right.</v>

761
00:30:54.603 --> 00:30:56.363
Mandatory vaccinations

762
00:30:56.363 --> 00:30:59.763
will cause such a deterioration

763
00:30:59.763 --> 00:31:03.163
in illness and destruction of the human race

764
00:31:03.163 --> 00:31:06.103
more rapidly than we're destroying ourselves

765
00:31:06.103 --> 00:31:08.383
by the way we're eating and living,

766
00:31:08.383 --> 00:31:11.583
that there will be eventually nothing left

767
00:31:11.583 --> 00:31:14.123
if we keep on this tact.

768
00:31:14.123 --> 00:31:18.003
Before vaccinations there was virtually no Autism

769
00:31:18.003 --> 00:31:21.143
and no sudden infant death syndrome.

770
00:31:21.143 --> 00:31:23.643
The main cause of sudden infant death syndrome

771
00:31:23.643 --> 00:31:25.263
is vaccinations.

772
00:31:25.263 --> 00:31:26.883
That has been established

773
00:31:26.883 --> 00:31:29.103
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

774
00:31:29.103 --> 00:31:32.203
A woman doctor named Viera Scheibner

775
00:31:32.203 --> 00:31:35.983
hooked a lot of babies up to various sensors

776
00:31:35.983 --> 00:31:38.603
for their blood pressure and

777
00:31:38.603 --> 00:31:41.763
their heart rate and their breathing rate.

778
00:31:41.763 --> 00:31:44.163
And she monitored these babies

779
00:31:44.163 --> 00:31:46.383
before they got a vaccination.

780
00:31:46.383 --> 00:31:49.663
And all of these vital signs were stable.

781
00:31:49.663 --> 00:31:52.323
And she has them all graphed according,

782
00:31:52.323 --> 00:31:54.623
right off the screen from the sensors

783
00:31:54.623 --> 00:31:56.923
that were attached to them.

784
00:31:56.923 --> 00:31:58.963
When they had their vaccinations,

785
00:31:58.963 --> 00:32:02.483
for a full three weeks after they had their vaccinations,

786
00:32:02.483 --> 00:32:06.103
all of these electrodes were off all over the place.

787
00:32:06.103 --> 00:32:10.343
The breathing and many of them would stop breathing

788
00:32:10.343 --> 00:32:13.003
but they had them hooked up to sensors

789
00:32:13.003 --> 00:32:15.283
so they would be on an alarm system

790
00:32:15.283 --> 00:32:17.383
while they were doing this experiment.

791
00:32:17.383 --> 00:32:18.883
But they would stop breathing,

792
00:32:18.883 --> 00:32:20.843
they would have very slow breathing,

793
00:32:20.843 --> 00:32:24.523
they would have, their temperatures would go sky-high

794
00:32:24.523 --> 00:32:28.343
where the child could have damage done to their brain

795
00:32:28.343 --> 00:32:30.403
from the high fever

796
00:32:30.403 --> 00:32:34.263
and cause seizures and various things like that.

797
00:32:34.263 --> 00:32:37.283
Cause learning disabilities by causing

798
00:32:37.283 --> 00:32:39.003
damage to the brain.

799
00:32:39.003 --> 00:32:41.323
And so it has been,

800
00:32:41.323 --> 00:32:44.563
if a doctor does not see a patient die

801
00:32:44.563 --> 00:32:47.403
within an hour from the time they give the vaccination,

802
00:32:47.403 --> 00:32:50.203
they'll say, "Oh, it has no correlation with it."

803
00:32:50.203 --> 00:32:51.903
But you see, if the child has had

804
00:32:51.903 --> 00:32:54.343
even this high fever caused by the vaccinations

805
00:32:54.343 --> 00:32:56.763
and all the contaminants in it,

806
00:32:56.763 --> 00:33:00.843
they may not show the symptoms of learning disabilities

807
00:33:00.843 --> 00:33:04.003
not for many years later until they go to school

808
00:33:04.003 --> 00:33:06.023
or various things like that.

809
00:33:06.023 --> 00:33:09.603
So it is, and these Autistic children,

810
00:33:09.603 --> 00:33:11.983
Autism was not known before

811
00:33:11.983 --> 00:33:14.803
the introduction of vaccinations.

812
00:33:14.803 --> 00:33:17.483
Vaccinations do not work.

813
00:33:17.483 --> 00:33:20.243
They don't work at all.

814
00:33:20.243 --> 00:33:22.563
They don't work--
<v Regina>But the medical</v>

815
00:33:22.563 --> 00:33:26.263
community would say, "But what about smallpox, for example?"

816
00:33:26.263 --> 00:33:27.623
<v ->Right.</v>

817
00:33:27.623 --> 00:33:29.523
There is an excellent book that I would

818
00:33:29.523 --> 00:33:31.003
recommend to everyone to read.

819
00:33:31.003 --> 00:33:34.443
I don't carry it, just go and get it on the internet.

820
00:33:34.443 --> 00:33:35.603
It's called

821
00:33:35.603 --> 00:33:39.083
"Vaccinations: Are They Really Safe and Effective?"

822
00:33:39.083 --> 00:33:41.483
And it's written by a man named Neil Miller.

823
00:33:41.483 --> 00:33:43.843
N-E-I-L Miller.

824
00:33:43.843 --> 00:33:46.543
He is a lay person, but he documents

825
00:33:46.543 --> 00:33:48.603
everything from the medical literature

826
00:33:48.603 --> 00:33:51.783
and the forward to his book is written by an M.D.

827
00:33:51.783 --> 00:33:53.603
It is an excellent book.

828
00:33:53.603 --> 00:33:55.163
It is not very big.

829
00:33:55.163 --> 00:33:59.243
It graphs all of the contagious diseases

830
00:33:59.243 --> 00:34:02.443
before the introduction of vaccines.

831
00:34:02.443 --> 00:34:04.103
And after.

832
00:34:04.103 --> 00:34:06.203
And shows there was no change.

833
00:34:06.203 --> 00:34:09.203
By the time, let's just take poliio.

834
00:34:09.203 --> 00:34:11.323
By the time the introduction,

835
00:34:11.323 --> 00:34:13.023
there were two polio vaccines.

836
00:34:13.023 --> 00:34:16.163
There was the Saulk and the Sabin vaccine.

837
00:34:16.163 --> 00:34:18.763
By the time they were introduced,

838
00:34:18.763 --> 00:34:21.683
the incidence of polio had already dropped

839
00:34:21.683 --> 00:34:26.063
by at least 85% because of improved sanitation

840
00:34:26.063 --> 00:34:29.103
and improved nutrition and things like that.

841
00:34:29.103 --> 00:34:32.303
And so when it was introduced,

842
00:34:32.303 --> 00:34:34.923
this vaccine was introduced,

843
00:34:34.923 --> 00:34:38.003
the slope of the curve did not change at all,

844
00:34:38.003 --> 00:34:40.043
which means it had no effect.

845
00:34:40.043 --> 00:34:42.183
The slope curve was already coming down.

846
00:34:42.183 --> 00:34:43.843
It was already coming down

847
00:34:43.843 --> 00:34:45.583
and it just continued the same slope.

848
00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:49.563
So it had no effect as far as decreasing the incidence.

849
00:34:49.563 --> 00:34:52.523
But after the polio vaccine was given,

850
00:34:52.523 --> 00:34:55.703
80% to 100% of all polio cases

851
00:34:55.703 --> 00:34:58.243
were caused by the vaccine.

852
00:34:58.243 --> 00:35:00.303
Because in order for you to

853
00:35:00.303 --> 00:35:03.763
supposedly develop immunity to the vaccine,

854
00:35:03.763 --> 00:35:06.783
you've got to have live virus in the vaccine.

855
00:35:06.783 --> 00:35:09.483
Well that gives you the disease.

856
00:35:09.483 --> 00:35:12.103
But they didn't want people to catch onto this.

857
00:35:12.103 --> 00:35:14.743
So they renamed the disease of Polio

858
00:35:14.743 --> 00:35:16.643
after they gave them the vaccine.

859
00:35:16.643 --> 00:35:19.544
And they called it Aseptic Meningitis.

860
00:35:19.544 --> 00:35:21.602
That was Polio but they gave it a different name

861
00:35:21.602 --> 00:35:23.182
so people didn't know that people

862
00:35:23.182 --> 00:35:26.162
were still getting Polio even after they'd been vaccinated.

863
00:35:26.162 --> 00:35:29.142
So vaccinations cause the disease.

864
00:35:29.142 --> 00:35:31.882
Plus they have mercury,

865
00:35:31.882 --> 00:35:33.982
which can cause Autism,

866
00:35:33.982 --> 00:35:35.922
and is a preservative.

867
00:35:35.922 --> 00:35:39.342
Mercury causes Autism, learning disabilities

868
00:35:39.342 --> 00:35:41.422
and various other things.

869
00:35:41.422 --> 00:35:44.602
Plus, as I say, they are grown in human cells

870
00:35:44.602 --> 00:35:46.242
or animal cells.

871
00:35:46.242 --> 00:35:49.462
Human cell cancer line, the line they're grown in,

872
00:35:49.462 --> 00:35:51.022
is cancer cells.

873
00:35:51.022 --> 00:35:52.722
And so you're having cancer cells

874
00:35:52.722 --> 00:35:54.622
injected into your body.

875
00:35:54.622 --> 00:35:57.340
because any cell line, human cell line,

876
00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:59.420
that is an old cell line

877
00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:03.140
will always become a carcinogenic cell line.

878
00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:06.200
So when you have vaccines injected into

879
00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.480
your body or your children's body,

880
00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:12.400
you are having a whole bundle of toxins put in there.

881
00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.240
One other thing that's very important

882
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.220
is the Centers for Disease Control is now making

883
00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.760
what they call super vaccines.

884
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:24.000
Where they have six or seven vaccines in one vaccine

885
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.560
that they can give you in one shot.

886
00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:30.470
Well, let me tell you how damaging that is.

887
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:32.920
The Centers for Disease Control knows about this

888
00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.520
because they did studies

889
00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.760
where they took a group of animals

890
00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:40.900
and they gave the animals one, injected

891
00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:44.080
into it, one bacteria that's supposed to be

892
00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.700
non-pathogenic, right.

893
00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.560
That means it doesn't cause disease

894
00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.460
in that animal line.

895
00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:53.000
And many of those bacterian and animal viruses

896
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.827
are contaminants in these cell lines

897
00:36:54.827 --> 00:36:58.247
in which the vaccinations are cultured and grown.

898
00:36:58.247 --> 00:37:01.647
So they put one of these contaminants in it

899
00:37:01.647 --> 00:37:03.967
and just injected a group of

900
00:37:03.967 --> 00:37:05.483
experimental animals with it.

901
00:37:05.483 --> 00:37:07.139
Nothing happened to the animals.

902
00:37:07.139 --> 00:37:08.479
They were perfectly healthy,

903
00:37:08.479 --> 00:37:10.519
they watched them for a long period of time.

904
00:37:10.519 --> 00:37:12.599
Then they took another group of animals

905
00:37:12.599 --> 00:37:15.999
and injected a different non-pathogenic,

906
00:37:15.999 --> 00:37:18.999
non-disease causing organism into those animals.

907
00:37:18.999 --> 00:37:20.759
They were fine too.

908
00:37:20.759 --> 00:37:22.879
Then they took a third group of animals

909
00:37:22.879 --> 00:37:27.159
and they combined those two non-pathogenic organisms

910
00:37:27.159 --> 00:37:29.759
that they had individually injected

911
00:37:29.759 --> 00:37:31.259
into these two groups.

912
00:37:31.259 --> 00:37:33.339
They combined them and they injected it

913
00:37:33.339 --> 00:37:35.299
into the third group.

914
00:37:35.299 --> 00:37:37.119
Every animal died.

915
00:37:37.119 --> 00:37:39.019
<v Regina>And this is what they're doing with the vaccines?</v>

916
00:37:39.019 --> 00:37:41.139
<v ->They're putting all of these different vaccinations</v>

917
00:37:41.139 --> 00:37:44.039
with all of these different non-pathogenic

918
00:37:44.039 --> 00:37:46.239
contaminants in there.

919
00:37:46.239 --> 00:37:48.939
And they are going to be lethal.

920
00:37:48.939 --> 00:37:53.039
You see, people say, "Well, my family got vaccinated

921
00:37:53.039 --> 00:37:56.139
"and we're fine, so then there's no problem."

922
00:37:56.139 --> 00:37:59.139
Well if everybody died with the vaccinations,

923
00:37:59.139 --> 00:38:02.179
nobody would get, nobody would take them.

924
00:38:02.179 --> 00:38:05.259
So naturally they're not going to give you something,

925
00:38:05.259 --> 00:38:06.579
just like with chemotherapy.

926
00:38:06.579 --> 00:38:07.999
Not everybody dies.

927
00:38:07.999 --> 00:38:09.999
That doesn't mean it's good for you.

928
00:38:09.999 --> 00:38:12.879
Not everybody dies at an early age

929
00:38:12.879 --> 00:38:14.799
when they eat very badly.

930
00:38:14.799 --> 00:38:15.999
But some people do.

931
00:38:15.999 --> 00:38:17.579
Some children get leukemia from the way

932
00:38:17.579 --> 00:38:19.859
that they're eating and various other things.

933
00:38:19.859 --> 00:38:22.299
But just because not everybody dies

934
00:38:22.299 --> 00:38:24.159
doesn't mean it's good for you.

935
00:38:24.159 --> 00:38:26.719
You can give people small doses of arsenic

936
00:38:26.719 --> 00:38:28.419
for a very long period of time

937
00:38:28.419 --> 00:38:30.039
and they may not die.

938
00:38:30.039 --> 00:38:32.159
Even Houdini.

939
00:38:32.159 --> 00:38:35.459
Houdini tood a very large dose of arsenic

940
00:38:35.459 --> 00:38:40.159
but lined his stomach with a huge amount of charcoal before.

941
00:38:40.159 --> 00:38:44.939
And charcoal is a toxin-remover and it

942
00:38:44.939 --> 00:38:47.499
took care of the arsenic.

943
00:38:47.499 --> 00:38:49.479
I'm not suggesting anybody try this.

944
00:38:49.479 --> 00:38:50.799
<v Regina>Right.</v>
(both laugh)

945
00:38:50.799 --> 00:38:52.379
<v ->But that's the way he did it.</v>

946
00:38:52.379 --> 00:38:54.519
But just because not everybody dies

947
00:38:54.519 --> 00:38:56.639
from a particular disease doesn't mean

948
00:38:56.639 --> 00:38:58.679
that the treatment that's given is good.

949
00:38:58.679 --> 00:39:01.699
We have to use some common sense.

950
00:39:01.699 --> 00:39:04.559
And vaccinations are a huge boon

951
00:39:04.559 --> 00:39:07.519
to the greedy pharmaceutical companies.

952
00:39:07.519 --> 00:39:08.859
They do not work.

953
00:39:08.859 --> 00:39:11.779
The way you keep from getting a disease

954
00:39:11.779 --> 00:39:16.099
is to feed and water and take care

955
00:39:16.099 --> 00:39:19.079
of your immune system the proper way.

956
00:39:19.079 --> 00:39:22.259
Because it's the immune system that will get you well.

957
00:39:22.259 --> 00:39:24.359
And if you're eating and living the wrong way

958
00:39:24.359 --> 00:39:25.719
and you destroy that,

959
00:39:25.719 --> 00:39:27.939
and then you take vaccinations on top of it,

960
00:39:27.939 --> 00:39:30.779
this is a perfect killer for the human race.

961
00:39:30.779 --> 00:39:33.359
<v Regina>But to go to public school they require it.</v>

962
00:39:33.359 --> 00:39:35.979
If you're an immigrant--
<v Lorraine>You can get waivers.</v>

963
00:39:35.979 --> 00:39:38.079
<v Regina>Can you on immigration as well?</v>

964
00:39:38.079 --> 00:39:38.899
<v ->Well I don't know.</v>

965
00:39:38.899 --> 00:39:40.639
But the thing is, you probably can get

966
00:39:40.639 --> 00:39:42.319
waivers for immigration.

967
00:39:42.319 --> 00:39:44.899
You can get waivers for going to school.

968
00:39:44.899 --> 00:39:47.439
It's not just public, it's other schools too that require it.

969
00:39:47.439 --> 00:39:49.257
<v Regina>Yes, that's true, private schools as well.</v>

970
00:39:49.257 --> 00:39:50.757
<v ->But you can get waivers.</v>

971
00:39:50.757 --> 00:39:52.997
And you can get it for religious reasons,

972
00:39:52.997 --> 00:39:55.557
you can get it for various other reasons.

973
00:39:55.557 --> 00:40:00.357
And if you go to the, I think I have

974
00:40:00.357 --> 00:40:03.057
in my workbook "Getting Started on Getting Well,"

975
00:40:03.057 --> 00:40:08.057
I have a section on vaccinations and in there,

976
00:40:08.397 --> 00:40:11.637
in the reference section, it's where you can go

977
00:40:11.637 --> 00:40:14.824
to get information on waivers in your state.

978
00:40:14.824 --> 00:40:18.924
And so, again, that workbook that goes with my videos

979
00:40:18.924 --> 00:40:21.624
is called "Getting Started on Getting Well."

980
00:40:21.624 --> 00:40:23.704
And if anyone wants to go to my website,

981
00:40:23.704 --> 00:40:28.704
that's www.drday.com.

982
00:40:28.744 --> 00:40:31.744
That's drday.com with small letters.

983
00:40:31.744 --> 00:40:35.864
That's where that information about the workbook,

984
00:40:35.864 --> 00:40:38.584
the videos and all that is available.

985
00:40:38.584 --> 00:40:41.064
<v Regina>So this is</v>

986
00:40:41.064 --> 00:40:44.464
going into some pretty deep water now,

987
00:40:44.464 --> 00:40:47.264
but why the control?

988
00:40:47.264 --> 00:40:51.684
Why the need for reducing the population?

989
00:40:51.684 --> 00:40:55.104
Who are the people that are subjecting

990
00:40:55.104 --> 00:40:57.564
the rest of the people to this?

991
00:40:57.564 --> 00:41:01.204
<v ->They are the elitist, and I can say probably</v>

992
00:41:01.204 --> 00:41:04.764
as briefly as possible, they're mainly the owners

993
00:41:04.764 --> 00:41:08.804
of the mult-national corporations and the elitist bankers.

994
00:41:08.804 --> 00:41:12.304
A group that's called the Illuminati,

995
00:41:12.304 --> 00:41:14.164
which is a secret organization.

996
00:41:14.164 --> 00:41:17.344
It has various sub-groups of that organization

997
00:41:17.344 --> 00:41:19.784
that many people have never heard of.

998
00:41:19.784 --> 00:41:21.164
The Trilateral Commission,

999
00:41:21.164 --> 00:41:23.364
the Club of Rome, the Bilderbergers.

1000
00:41:23.364 --> 00:41:26.004
Some have heard of the Council of Foreign Relations.

1001
00:41:26.004 --> 00:41:29.464
This is a group of very high-level,

1002
00:41:29.464 --> 00:41:33.144
generally rich people who have decided

1003
00:41:33.144 --> 00:41:36.404
that the average person is not capable

1004
00:41:36.404 --> 00:41:38.204
of running his own life.

1005
00:41:38.204 --> 00:41:41.124
Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is now governor of California,

1006
00:41:41.124 --> 00:41:45.464
has apparently said publicly that 85% or more

1007
00:41:45.464 --> 00:41:49.294
of the people in the world have to have

1008
00:41:49.294 --> 00:41:51.904
somebody else run their life for them.

1009
00:41:51.904 --> 00:41:55.224
And so this is the feeling of the elitists,

1010
00:41:55.224 --> 00:41:59.404
the elitist bankers or the Rothschilds, the Warburtons,

1011
00:41:59.404 --> 00:42:04.144
the CoonLobes, the big Wall Street financiers.

1012
00:42:04.144 --> 00:42:09.144
And the people who run the multi-national corporations.

1013
00:42:09.164 --> 00:42:12.704
You will see that as we have more and more mergers.

1014
00:42:12.704 --> 00:42:16.324
Twenty years ago we had many mergers of banks.

1015
00:42:16.324 --> 00:42:20.184
We have much fewer banks than we used to have.

1016
00:42:20.184 --> 00:42:23.104
In the 70s and early 80s we had mergers

1017
00:42:23.104 --> 00:42:24.664
of the newspapers.

1018
00:42:24.664 --> 00:42:27.724
In San Francisco used to have five newspapers,

1019
00:42:27.724 --> 00:42:29.984
now they have really one.

1020
00:42:29.984 --> 00:42:32.264
They have the Examiner and Chronicle,

1021
00:42:32.264 --> 00:42:35.464
but they're both from the same outfit.

1022
00:42:35.464 --> 00:42:39.624
So this--
<v Regina>Tearing down our</v>

1023
00:42:39.624 --> 00:42:41.124
sources of information.

1024
00:42:41.124 --> 00:42:43.204
<v ->That's right, and it's control.</v>

1025
00:42:43.204 --> 00:42:45.124
To give you an idea,

1026
00:42:45.124 --> 00:42:48.924
I walked into a radio station a number of years ago

1027
00:42:48.924 --> 00:42:50.484
to do an interview.

1028
00:42:50.484 --> 00:42:52.264
I said, "What is this?"

1029
00:42:52.264 --> 00:42:55.204
'Cause it was a fax machine that was running continuously.

1030
00:42:55.204 --> 00:42:57.164
He said, "That's like the old ticker tape."

1031
00:42:57.164 --> 00:42:58.904
He said, "Everything that comes in here

1032
00:42:58.904 --> 00:43:02.164
"comes from either UPI or Associated Press or Reuters.

1033
00:43:02.164 --> 00:43:04.844
"And it all is managed

1034
00:43:04.844 --> 00:43:07.244
"and they tell us to rewrite it

1035
00:43:07.244 --> 00:43:09.044
"so it won't all sound the same."

1036
00:43:09.044 --> 00:43:10.164
<v Regina>I was doing news at that time</v>

1037
00:43:10.164 --> 00:43:11.544
and that is correct.
<v Lorraine>That's right.</v>

1038
00:43:11.544 --> 00:43:15.044
And then they say, "But all the news is the same."

1039
00:43:15.044 --> 00:43:16.864
And I did a little experiment when I was

1040
00:43:16.864 --> 00:43:19.184
doing a lot of travelling I would sometimes

1041
00:43:19.184 --> 00:43:20.944
change planes several times.

1042
00:43:20.944 --> 00:43:23.144
And I would get a newspaper on the same day.

1043
00:43:23.144 --> 00:43:24.904
Virtually all the news on the front page

1044
00:43:24.904 --> 00:43:27.164
and on the front few pages was the same.

1045
00:43:27.164 --> 00:43:30.284
It had just been locally rewritten by the people there

1046
00:43:30.284 --> 00:43:33.304
so people wouldn't realize that it was managed.

1047
00:43:33.304 --> 00:43:37.144
All of the news on cancer that is put out

1048
00:43:37.144 --> 00:43:39.684
on any of the major wires

1049
00:43:39.684 --> 00:43:42.044
has to be reviewed by the people at

1050
00:43:42.044 --> 00:43:45.224
Memorial Stone Kettering Hospital in New York.

1051
00:43:45.224 --> 00:43:47.484
And so naturally they are going to control

1052
00:43:47.484 --> 00:43:49.524
the information that comes out.

1053
00:43:49.524 --> 00:43:52.204
The American Cancer Society was established

1054
00:43:52.204 --> 00:43:54.404
by one of the Rockefellers.

1055
00:43:54.404 --> 00:43:56.004
And at the time it was established,

1056
00:43:56.004 --> 00:43:58.024
it was established, he said,

1057
00:43:58.024 --> 00:44:02.064
to control the information that people learned about cancer

1058
00:44:02.064 --> 00:44:05.424
and to encourage them to go to their doctor.

1059
00:44:05.424 --> 00:44:07.824
That is the plan.
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>

1060
00:44:07.824 --> 00:44:10.724
<v ->The National Cancer Institute,</v>

1061
00:44:10.724 --> 00:44:13.244
so it was started by Rockefeller and his buddies.

1062
00:44:13.244 --> 00:44:15.701
These are the same elitists, the Rockefellers are involved

1063
00:44:15.701 --> 00:44:17.861
in this same sort of thing.

1064
00:44:18.641 --> 00:44:22.098
And so the elitists

1065
00:44:22.098 --> 00:44:25.278
want to control your health.

1066
00:44:25.278 --> 00:44:27.258
They don't want you to know

1067
00:44:27.258 --> 00:44:29.098
that you can control your health.

1068
00:44:29.098 --> 00:44:31.378
So there are, I have a lot of enemies.

1069
00:44:31.378 --> 00:44:33.018
I have been banned from many, many

1070
00:44:33.018 --> 00:44:36.678
radio shows and television shows because

1071
00:44:36.678 --> 00:44:39.658
the pharmaceutical companies are very strong.

1072
00:44:39.658 --> 00:44:41.918
You can't get any of the information like this

1073
00:44:41.918 --> 00:44:44.318
into the medical journals because

1074
00:44:44.318 --> 00:44:46.438
the pharmaceutical companies

1075
00:44:46.438 --> 00:44:48.318
will just pull their ads.

1076
00:44:48.318 --> 00:44:51.098
And there are more pages in a medical journal

1077
00:44:51.098 --> 00:44:54.298
of high-priced, full color pharmaceutical ads

1078
00:44:54.298 --> 00:44:56.418
than there is of medical information.

1079
00:44:56.418 --> 00:44:59.358
And so if they pull their ads there will be no journal.

1080
00:44:59.358 --> 00:45:00.998
<v Regina>It's the same on</v>

1081
00:45:00.998 --> 00:45:03.000
the classic news stations, cable television

1082
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.100
unless you go some place like Link TV.

1083
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.100
<v ->That's right.</v>

1084
00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:08.260
And so when they have these huge ads

1085
00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.960
and you can't turn on the television set for one hour

1086
00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:14.340
without seeing high-priced drug ads.

1087
00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:16.900
And now they're going directly to the public, you know.

1088
00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:19.220
This is probably what you need, go tell your doctor

1089
00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.920
this is what you need.

1090
00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.600
And that was really all started by

1091
00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.980
the pharmaceutical companies who are, again,

1092
00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:29.540
owned and controlled by the same elitist group.

1093
00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:33.870
And people say, "Well, are you into conspiracies?"

1094
00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:37.140
Well I just want to ask the person viewing this.

1095
00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:40.560
If you work in an office with more than five people,

1096
00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.440
is there somebody who wants your job?

1097
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.860
Is there somebody who wants your office?

1098
00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:47.880
Or do you want somebody else's office?

1099
00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.420
Everything is a conspiracy.

1100
00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:52.360
Everybody wants something that somebody else has.

1101
00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.480
That's the way, unfortunately, life is.

1102
00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:59.440
The bigger the stakes, the more people want it.

1103
00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:02.380
When you have all the money you can have

1104
00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.200
then you want control.

1105
00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.320
How much better to be in control of the whole human race?

1106
00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:09.860
People think communism is dead, it's not.

1107
00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:12.580
It's alive and well in our country.

1108
00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:15.440
All 10 planks of the Communist Manifesto

1109
00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.540
have been introduced into our government.

1110
00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:21.040
Rockefeller has said that

1111
00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.560
competition is a sin.

1112
00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.240
Well, people think that he's a capitalist.

1113
00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:29.420
But what the capitalists want is that,

1114
00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:31.740
they want to only deal with the heads

1115
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.380
of the various governments.

1116
00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:34.920
And the only way you can do that

1117
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.540
is to have them be communists

1118
00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:39.940
where everything is planned in a central agency

1119
00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:41.980
and then you just deal with them.

1120
00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:44.100
And so the ones who profess to be capitalists

1121
00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:46.340
want to eliminate all competition.

1122
00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:48.460
That's why you're seeing all these mergers

1123
00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:51.920
to get all of the department stores,

1124
00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:56.520
the banks and everything else, the car companies,

1125
00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:00.500
into the hands of what is called the Committee of 300.

1126
00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:01.600
<v Regina>But what happened</v>

1127
00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:03.660
to anti-trust laws, for example?

1128
00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:07.700
<v ->Well again, Congress does not run the corporations.</v>

1129
00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:11.200
The corporations run Congress.

1130
00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:16.200
The FDA does not oversee the pharmaceutical companies

1131
00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.780
which they were meant to do.

1132
00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:21.640
Pharmaceutical companies have so much money

1133
00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:26.620
that they bribe and infiltrate the FDA.

1134
00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:29.040
There's a revolving door between

1135
00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.700
the Federal Drug Administration

1136
00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:33.800
and the pharmaceutical companies.

1137
00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.500
Pharmaceutical executives or sub-executives

1138
00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:39.800
go to work for the FDA until they get their drug approved,

1139
00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:41.060
then they go back to working

1140
00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:42.500
for their pharmaceutical company.

1141
00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.860
<v Regina>Kevin Trudeau blows the whistle on this one</v>

1142
00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:46.560
in his new book,

1143
00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:50.080
"Natural Cures that They Don't Want You to Know About."

1144
00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.900
<v ->That's correct, unfortunately Kevin Trudeau</v>

1145
00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:56.280
doesn't quite know the extent of natural cures either,

1146
00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:58.360
but certainly it's a step in the right direction.

1147
00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:02.480
He does understand what's happening in the drug industry

1148
00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.260
and I pointed that out, actually, almost 10 years ago

1149
00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:07.560
in my videos and on my video

1150
00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.800
"Cancer Doesn't Scare Me Anymore."

1151
00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:11.740
The National Cancer Institute, which is

1152
00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:15.100
part of the government National Institutes of Health,

1153
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:19.220
I point out on my video "Cancer Doesn't Scare me Anymore,"

1154
00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:22.900
where I discuss many of the things I'm discussing now.

1155
00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.120
If you go to their website, I don't know

1156
00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.420
if it's still that way today,

1157
00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:29.804
but I proved that it was a couple of years ago anyway.

1158
00:48:29.804 --> 00:48:32.404
They have two sides to their website.

1159
00:48:32.404 --> 00:48:36.364
One is for medical professionals, doctors and nurses.

1160
00:48:36.364 --> 00:48:38.804
And they use a lot of medical terminology.

1161
00:48:38.804 --> 00:48:41.224
And the other one is for the lay people.

1162
00:48:41.224 --> 00:48:42.924
On the side for the lay people

1163
00:48:42.924 --> 00:48:46.124
they do not tell you that abortion

1164
00:48:46.124 --> 00:48:49.424
will increase your risk of breast cancer.

1165
00:48:49.424 --> 00:48:52.284
On the side for the medical industry,

1166
00:48:52.284 --> 00:48:55.084
they will admit that having an abortion

1167
00:48:55.084 --> 00:48:58.124
increases dramatically your incidence

1168
00:48:58.124 --> 00:49:00.864
of developing breast cancer.

1169
00:49:00.864 --> 00:49:03.864
Now, interestingly, they say why does that happen?

1170
00:49:03.864 --> 00:49:06.724
Well, when a woman becomes pregnant,

1171
00:49:06.724 --> 00:49:09.644
hormones are produced in her body

1172
00:49:09.644 --> 00:49:13.064
that are meant to take the breast cells

1173
00:49:13.064 --> 00:49:16.124
to milk-producing cells.

1174
00:49:16.124 --> 00:49:19.404
Early on in that stage while it's doing that,

1175
00:49:19.404 --> 00:49:24.264
the breast cells are very unstable.

1176
00:49:24.264 --> 00:49:27.044
When a woman has an abortion,

1177
00:49:27.044 --> 00:49:30.024
those breast cells remain unstable.

1178
00:49:30.024 --> 00:49:31.904
<v Regina>Hmm, I've never heard this.</v>

1179
00:49:31.904 --> 00:49:33.884
<v ->That's right, they remain unstable</v>

1180
00:49:33.884 --> 00:49:36.984
and it causes a vast increase

1181
00:49:36.984 --> 00:49:40.084
in her risk of breast cancer.

1182
00:49:40.084 --> 00:49:44.244
They did studies on animals and found out,

1183
00:49:44.244 --> 00:49:47.864
all the animals were pregnant in the two groups.

1184
00:49:47.864 --> 00:49:51.904
In one they aborted the animals.

1185
00:49:51.904 --> 00:49:55.484
And they gave all of the animals

1186
00:49:55.484 --> 00:49:59.024
a breast-cancer-inducing drug.

1187
00:49:59.024 --> 00:50:03.984
And so when they gave all the animals this,

1188
00:50:03.984 --> 00:50:07.244
they were developing breast cancer.

1189
00:50:07.244 --> 00:50:11.224
They aborted one group and left the other go to term.

1190
00:50:11.224 --> 00:50:14.484
The incidence in the group that went to term

1191
00:50:14.484 --> 00:50:16.704
was 5% breast cancer.

1192
00:50:16.704 --> 00:50:18.344
In the group that was aborted,

1193
00:50:18.344 --> 00:50:22.454
the incidence was 77% breast cancer.

1194
00:50:22.824 --> 00:50:27.000
<v Regina>All right, geez Lorraine, thank you.</v>

1195
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.300
Thank you for all of this.

1196
00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.480
We have only a minute or so left.

1197
00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:35.840
In brief, we need to come full circle on this

1198
00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:37.560
and how we unplug.

1199
00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:39.980
How an everyday person unplugs from the system.

1200
00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:41.820
<v ->Well the way they do it is by information.</v>

1201
00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:43.400
Like the information that I'm giving you now

1202
00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:47.700
and go to my website at www.drday.com.

1203
00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:50.100
There's more information on how to be well.

1204
00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:52.120
Anyone can take charge of their health.

1205
00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.660
They don't have to bow at the knee to the white coats.

1206
00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:55.920
We were meant to heal.

1207
00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.060
Our bodies were meant to heal.

1208
00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.600
As you get more and more information

1209
00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:00.580
you will have more and more confidence

1210
00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:02.640
about how to take care fo your body

1211
00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:04.220
and how to stay well.

1212
00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:06.340
Every mother wants to raise her children

1213
00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:07.780
so they will be healthy.

1214
00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:09.080
You can do it.

1215
00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:11.220
But if you don't do it, you may be responsible

1216
00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:13.040
for helping put your child in the grave

1217
00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.720
at an early age with leukemia or something else.

1218
00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:17.640
What a tragedy that would be.

1219
00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:21.040
So I just say realize that information

1220
00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:23.060
gives you power.

1221
00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:25.680
And you do not have to rely on the

1222
00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.680
medical-industrial complex

1223
00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:31.010
or vaccinations which don't work anyway.

1224
00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:33.730
<v Regina>Thank you.</v>

1225
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:36.000
If you find these subjects interesting,

1226
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.980
you will likely also enjoy our interviews

1227
00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:40.320
with Dr. Burton Goldberg, who also shares

1228
00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:42.100
inside knowledge of what's out there

1229
00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:44.520
by way of alternative healing technologies

1230
00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.920
as well as some of the inside politics.

1231
00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:50.030
Until next time, thanks for watching.
