1
00:00:00.852 --> 00:00:03.021
<v ->John Anthony West is really stirring it up</v>

2
00:00:03.021 --> 00:00:04.325
in this interview.

3
00:00:04.325 --> 00:00:07.026
While many in the world of alternative Egyptian history

4
00:00:07.026 --> 00:00:08.527
have ventured forth with the notion

5
00:00:08.527 --> 00:00:11.330
that Egypt's great artifacts, such as the Sphinx,

6
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.699
are thousands of years older than history acknowledges,

7
00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.911
John is saying let's take a look even further back.

8
00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:20.539
He says cosmological and physical evidence

9
00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.775
suggests the Sphinx may have been built by a very

10
00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:27.747
civilized and advanced culture up to 36,000 years ago,

11
00:00:27.747 --> 00:00:29.264
or even beyond.

12
00:00:37.426 --> 00:00:40.025
Well, you're still shaking them up, I love it.

13
00:00:40.025 --> 00:00:43.428
You against the world of quackademics,

14
00:00:43.428 --> 00:00:44.997
as you call.

15
00:00:44.997 --> 00:00:46.098
<v ->Quackademia, yes.</v>

16
00:00:46.098 --> 00:00:48.900
<v Host>Quackademia, and now we're looking at,</v>

17
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.903
we're going to talk about something entirely different

18
00:00:50.903 --> 00:00:54.038
in a minute, but you're getting a group of people

19
00:00:54.038 --> 00:00:57.709
together now, including the world of academia,

20
00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:59.678
to start evaluating the Sphinx

21
00:00:59.678 --> 00:01:01.447
on an entirely different level.

22
00:01:01.447 --> 00:01:03.648
And here we're at the precession of the Equinox

23
00:01:03.648 --> 00:01:06.321
Conference CPAC.

24
00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:08.620
You're looking at not just jumping back from 5,000

25
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.790
to 11,000 years as dating on the Sphinx,

26
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.029
but perhaps as many as 36,000 years.

27
00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:16.563
Can you talk about this now?

28
00:01:16.563 --> 00:01:19.438
<v ->Sure, but do you want me to repeat what you just said?</v>

29
00:01:19.438 --> 00:01:20.898
You're going to be on camera?

30
00:01:20.898 --> 00:01:22.668
<v ->No, they heard me.</v>

31
00:01:22.668 --> 00:01:24.068
<v ->Oh, they heard you, that's fine.</v>

32
00:01:24.068 --> 00:01:25.270
<v ->They heard me, you just go with it.</v>

33
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.809
<v ->It's a complex argument actually.</v>

34
00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:36.809
But its barebones are that Schoch takes that 5,000 B.C. date

35
00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.553
as the latest that it possibly could be done.

36
00:01:41.553 --> 00:01:42.654
<v ->And we're talking Robert Schoch.</v>

37
00:01:42.654 --> 00:01:43.655
<v ->Robert Schoch, yes.</v>

38
00:01:46.091 --> 00:01:48.627
With the qualification there that that's the earliest.

39
00:01:48.627 --> 00:01:52.364
It could be older, but as a ten-year geologist

40
00:01:52.364 --> 00:01:57.364
and scientist, it behooves him to be as conservative

41
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.940
as he possibly can without traducing his own beliefs.

42
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.940
The 10,500 date is chosen by, granted my colleagues,

43
00:02:08.213 --> 00:02:11.516
my friends, Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval,

44
00:02:11.516 --> 00:02:15.487
on the basis of that's the last time that there

45
00:02:15.487 --> 00:02:17.822
was an ingress into the sign of Leo.

46
00:02:17.822 --> 00:02:22.822
And the Sphinx shrieks out Leo symbolism at you.

47
00:02:22.827 --> 00:02:25.663
Of course, to the quackademic community,

48
00:02:25.663 --> 00:02:28.400
the ancients didn't know about precession of the Equinox

49
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.836
as though there's a commanding ton of evidence

50
00:02:31.836 --> 00:02:33.605
that says they did know.

51
00:02:33.605 --> 00:02:36.273
However, the problem with the 10,500 date

52
00:02:36.273 --> 00:02:41.273
is that the event now thought to be a comet strike

53
00:02:42.614 --> 00:02:46.685
in somewhere about 12,000 or so B.C., 12,500

54
00:02:46.685 --> 00:02:50.522
something somewhere around that area,

55
00:02:50.522 --> 00:02:55.522
effectively started or triggered the meltdown

56
00:02:56.396 --> 00:03:00.932
of the ice ages of the last glacial period.

57
00:03:00.932 --> 00:03:05.932
And in so doing, pretty much spread or rained catastrophe

58
00:03:06.238 --> 00:03:07.372
all over the world.

59
00:03:07.372 --> 00:03:09.310
Tremendous earthquakes, huge floods,

60
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.713
torrential rains, all kinds of things of that nature.

61
00:03:12.713 --> 00:03:15.281
And the Sphinx and its attendant temples

62
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:20.184
screams out, or let's say presupposes

63
00:03:20.184 --> 00:03:23.788
a settled civilization capable of organizing

64
00:03:23.788 --> 00:03:27.528
that kind of a massive logistical effort

65
00:03:27.528 --> 00:03:30.895
with these giant stones produced in these temples.

66
00:03:30.895 --> 00:03:33.766
And with it, the technical or the artistic expertise

67
00:03:33.766 --> 00:03:37.469
to carve this unbelievable statue.

68
00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:41.440
So it's very difficult to imagine there could be

69
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.875
such a society in the midst of what seems

70
00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:47.211
to be global chaos.

71
00:03:47.211 --> 00:03:52.211
So, taking as a given that the Leo symbolism is valid,

72
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.220
the last time or the time before that that the Sphinx

73
00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.392
would have been facing its own sign at the spring Equinox

74
00:04:00.392 --> 00:04:04.830
is 26,000 years prior to 10,000 years.

75
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.830
So you're talking about a ballpark date of 36, 37,000 years.

76
00:04:09.935 --> 00:04:13.839
And that, however, implausible it may sound,

77
00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:18.839
does correspond to the Egyptians own text,

78
00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.082
their own chronological tablets.

79
00:04:21.082 --> 00:04:23.014
There's two, there's the Palermo Stone

80
00:04:23.014 --> 00:04:24.749
and the Turin Papyrus.

81
00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:27.719
where Egypt talks about these long reigns of mythical

82
00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:30.554
divine beings who ruled Egypt.

83
00:04:30.554 --> 00:04:32.523
This of course, is dismissed out of hand by

84
00:04:32.523 --> 00:04:35.062
the academic Egyptologists as though they know

85
00:04:35.062 --> 00:04:39.331
Egyptian pre-history better than the ancient Egyptians do.

86
00:04:39.331 --> 00:04:41.232
And those dates, when you compute them all out,

87
00:04:41.232 --> 00:04:43.336
again they're fairly fragmentary,

88
00:04:43.336 --> 00:04:45.769
they don't agree entirely with each other.

89
00:04:45.769 --> 00:04:47.642
But they talk about a date

90
00:04:47.642 --> 00:04:51.075
more or less 34 or 36,000 years ago,

91
00:04:51.075 --> 00:04:54.612
which is when Egypt starts.

92
00:04:54.612 --> 00:04:59.612
And that date corresponds closest to the Vedic texts

93
00:05:00.252 --> 00:05:04.223
which talk about Indian civilization also getting started

94
00:05:04.223 --> 00:05:08.128
somewhere around those dates.

95
00:05:08.128 --> 00:05:13.128
Given the 5,000 date doesn't seem possible for it to work

96
00:05:13.364 --> 00:05:16.334
because again, for a variety of complex reasons,

97
00:05:16.334 --> 00:05:17.536
not going into where.

98
00:05:17.536 --> 00:05:19.703
And the 10,000 date not working because

99
00:05:19.703 --> 00:05:24.703
of global climatic conditions reigning at that time.

100
00:05:25.243 --> 00:05:30.243
36,000 is the next let's say, plausible date for it.

101
00:05:31.716 --> 00:05:34.319
And I must say, when we're trying to get this panel

102
00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.821
of geologists to get over there now and settle this matter

103
00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:41.360
of weathering once and for all.

104
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.687
And one of the questions that we will raise with them,

105
00:05:45.687 --> 00:05:48.902
is look, this weathering that we see

106
00:05:48.902 --> 00:05:51.802
in front of our noses now is extreme.

107
00:05:51.802 --> 00:05:53.805
Do you know of any other weathering,

108
00:05:53.805 --> 00:05:57.275
even on earth, that is as extreme as this,

109
00:05:57.275 --> 00:05:58.742
this kind of weathering?

110
00:05:58.742 --> 00:06:03.148
And if so, can we, even within broad parameters,

111
00:06:06.384 --> 00:06:09.154
create a scenario of some sort.

112
00:06:09.154 --> 00:06:12.524
Even however roughly, that the kind of conditions

113
00:06:12.524 --> 00:06:16.594
that would be needed to produce this kind of weathering,

114
00:06:16.594 --> 00:06:19.129
how much rain over how long a period of time,

115
00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.433
or how quickly or whatever.

116
00:06:21.433 --> 00:06:23.735
And so for me, it wouldn't even surprise me

117
00:06:23.735 --> 00:06:28.106
if a date prior to 36,000 B.C. came up.

118
00:06:28.106 --> 00:06:30.677
But for me, I would put my bets at the moment

119
00:06:30.677 --> 00:06:34.845
at something, somewhere around that period.

120
00:06:34.845 --> 00:06:37.047
<v Host>Well now this pushes it for everybody,</v>

121
00:06:37.047 --> 00:06:38.382
not just Egyptologists.

122
00:06:38.382 --> 00:06:39.084
<v ->Oh sure.</v>

123
00:06:39.084 --> 00:06:41.319
<v Host>Are you standing alone in this?</v>

124
00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:45.323
Or are there others you are collaborating with

125
00:06:45.323 --> 00:06:47.593
who are basically seeing the same thing you're seeing here?

126
00:06:49.303 --> 00:06:51.596
<v ->Well, they're not disagreeing with me, actually.</v>

127
00:06:51.596 --> 00:06:55.667
And then, of course, Hindu people who practice

128
00:06:55.667 --> 00:06:59.838
and follow the Vedas and Hinduism,

129
00:06:59.838 --> 00:07:03.174
for them there are these gigantic Yuga cycles

130
00:07:03.174 --> 00:07:04.943
that stretch back millions of years

131
00:07:04.943 --> 00:07:06.911
where human beings have been on Earth.

132
00:07:06.911 --> 00:07:11.911
And of course, the legends and myths innumerable,

133
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:17.350
both highly organized societies and tribal

134
00:07:17.756 --> 00:07:22.756
or traditional societies talk about rise and falls,

135
00:07:22.827 --> 00:07:26.664
the rising and falling of successive civilizations.

136
00:07:26.664 --> 00:07:29.034
So, without putting dates on them,

137
00:07:29.034 --> 00:07:30.802
yeah, it's not as though I'm out there in the wilderness

138
00:07:30.802 --> 00:07:34.973
one lone nut talking about it ain't like this.

139
00:07:34.973 --> 00:07:39.045
There's, let's say there's ample

140
00:07:41.546 --> 00:07:45.483
textual or legendary evidence that would support

141
00:07:45.483 --> 00:07:50.022
such a view even if there isn't any hard data at the moment.

142
00:07:50.022 --> 00:07:52.523
<v Host>What I don't understand is why such great</v>

143
00:07:52.523 --> 00:07:56.527
resistance by the Egyptian archaeologists themselves,

144
00:07:56.527 --> 00:08:01.527
when if this could be validated in some way it makes

145
00:08:02.033 --> 00:08:04.502
for a much richer story about the region

146
00:08:04.502 --> 00:08:06.871
that draws millions of tourists every year,

147
00:08:06.871 --> 00:08:09.574
just purely on that level alone.

148
00:08:11.343 --> 00:08:13.077
<v ->People don't like to change their ideas.</v>

149
00:08:13.077 --> 00:08:15.780
And the funny thing is that I think that Zahi Hawass

150
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.150
who's now the big honcho and is now,

151
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:23.150
through a series of near miraculous events,

152
00:08:23.755 --> 00:08:27.025
become quite, I wouldn't say a close friend of mine,

153
00:08:27.025 --> 00:08:28.727
but a good friend.

154
00:08:28.727 --> 00:08:32.297
Even though in public he's as adamant again

155
00:08:32.297 --> 00:08:34.465
about all these new age nuts who are trying

156
00:08:34.465 --> 00:08:37.001
to revise Egypt history.

157
00:08:37.001 --> 00:08:38.670
<v Host>Oh, you're telling the real juice though.</v>

158
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:41.275
<v ->On a personal level, we get on quite well.</v>

159
00:08:41.275 --> 00:08:44.342
And deep down it wouldn't surprise me if he thinks

160
00:08:44.342 --> 00:08:47.212
there might be something to it, because he's given,

161
00:08:47.212 --> 00:08:51.049
not a verbal commitment, but a verbal,

162
00:08:51.049 --> 00:08:54.920
a written e-mail statement saying that if we

163
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.422
put our panel of experts together, the idea is

164
00:08:57.422 --> 00:08:59.491
to put a panel of expert geologists together

165
00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:03.227
who are either committed to our side or just open

166
00:09:03.227 --> 00:09:05.362
to the project, they don't have to be committed to our side,

167
00:09:05.362 --> 00:09:07.498
we'll let the evidence speak for itself.

168
00:09:07.498 --> 00:09:11.669
And then an opposing panel of opponents,

169
00:09:11.669 --> 00:09:13.371
also geologists, there are a few.

170
00:09:13.371 --> 00:09:15.839
But mostly the geological community is on our side.

171
00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:17.441
They just haven't gone into Egypt to look

172
00:09:17.441 --> 00:09:18.811
at the evidence themselves.

173
00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:21.979
Then let everybody duke it out for a couple of weeks

174
00:09:21.979 --> 00:09:24.754
on the Giza Plateau and look at the other evidence.

175
00:09:24.754 --> 00:09:28.121
And see what kinds of conclusions they come to.

176
00:09:28.121 --> 00:09:30.324
And my conviction is, I won't say my conviction,

177
00:09:30.324 --> 00:09:33.091
but my,

178
00:09:33.091 --> 00:09:36.728
my belief is that if the evidence is strong enough

179
00:09:36.728 --> 00:09:40.097
and presented in just the right way, Zahi will turn.

180
00:09:40.097 --> 00:09:41.702
Meanwhile, I've...

181
00:09:41.702 --> 00:09:42.702
<v Host>That would be huge.</v>

182
00:09:42.702 --> 00:09:44.502
<v ->A number of times to say look Zahi,</v>

183
00:09:44.502 --> 00:09:49.502
we're not taking Egypt history, we're trying to glorify it

184
00:09:50.042 --> 00:09:51.276
to an even extent.

185
00:09:51.276 --> 00:09:54.978
But, changing anybody,

186
00:09:54.978 --> 00:09:57.816
look, changing people's minds

187
00:09:57.816 --> 00:09:59.450
is the hardest thing in the world.

188
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:03.021
Anybody who writes about a lot of new age malarkey out there

189
00:10:03.021 --> 00:10:05.322
that starts out with, this is very simple,

190
00:10:05.322 --> 00:10:07.458
all you have to do is change your attitude.

191
00:10:07.458 --> 00:10:10.594
That tells me that whoever is writing the book

192
00:10:10.594 --> 00:10:13.531
has not done one second of inner work.

193
00:10:13.531 --> 00:10:14.732
Because changing your attitude

194
00:10:14.732 --> 00:10:16.768
is the most difficult thing to do.

195
00:10:16.768 --> 00:10:18.303
Anybody can climb Everest.

196
00:10:18.303 --> 00:10:20.705
Changing an attitude, that's work.

197
00:10:20.705 --> 00:10:23.840
<v Host>(laughing) You are right.</v>

198
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.978
<v ->Mine, too, I mean it doesn't change easily.</v>

199
00:10:25.978 --> 00:10:29.180
<v Host>Sure, now what are the larger implications of this?</v>

200
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.649
That the Sphinx is now not 5,000 years old.

201
00:10:31.649 --> 00:10:33.050
I mean, we've tracked that.

202
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.755
But 36 or 37,000 years old.

203
00:10:36.755 --> 00:10:38.289
What does this mean to mankind?

204
00:10:38.289 --> 00:10:42.226
<v ->Well, you know, that in itself, not such a big deal</v>

205
00:10:42.226 --> 00:10:45.029
in terms of, I mean if it's 5,000 years old

206
00:10:45.029 --> 00:10:48.333
it throws all of history upside down anyway.

207
00:10:48.333 --> 00:10:50.634
But yes in terms of there's a certain

208
00:10:50.634 --> 00:10:54.006
what should we say?

209
00:10:54.006 --> 00:10:56.374
I mean if you suddenly knew, I mean if the data

210
00:10:56.374 --> 00:10:59.379
supported that conclusion that the Sphinx,

211
00:10:59.379 --> 00:11:03.549
in all likelihood was constructed and the temples around it

212
00:11:03.549 --> 00:11:08.352
around 36,000 B.C., it would provide a timeline

213
00:11:08.352 --> 00:11:12.723
for advanced human civilization far beyond anything

214
00:11:12.723 --> 00:11:16.062
that you would contemplate otherwise.

215
00:11:16.062 --> 00:11:19.965
5,000, well that's close enough to 3,000 when Egypt rises.

216
00:11:19.965 --> 00:11:23.468
36,000, that's when everybody is supposed to be

217
00:11:23.468 --> 00:11:27.708
hunter-gathers and hurling spears at each other.

218
00:11:27.708 --> 00:11:31.113
And no settled civilization, no science,

219
00:11:31.113 --> 00:11:33.613
no architecture, no anything.

220
00:11:33.613 --> 00:11:37.649
So it would mean that our history as a civilized race,

221
00:11:37.649 --> 00:11:39.450
which has come to an end recently.

222
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:44.054
But our past history as a civilized race would be extended

223
00:11:44.054 --> 00:11:45.391
back into the past.

224
00:11:45.391 --> 00:11:48.258
And by extension perhaps even further than that

225
00:11:48.258 --> 00:11:50.061
since you don't necessarily need the Sphinx

226
00:11:50.061 --> 00:11:52.863
and temples to be civilized human beings.

227
00:11:52.863 --> 00:11:55.533
You just have to be doing a certain kind of inner work

228
00:11:55.533 --> 00:11:58.636
that connects us with our return to the source.

229
00:12:03.182 --> 00:12:05.709
So it would be a big difference between thinking,

230
00:12:05.709 --> 00:12:08.378
gee there were civilized people back in 5,000 B.C.

231
00:12:08.378 --> 00:12:12.550
and thinking gosh there were truly, immensely advanced

232
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.886
and civilized people 30,000 years before that.

233
00:12:15.886 --> 00:12:18.222
So yes, that would be a big thing.

234
00:12:18.222 --> 00:12:20.424
<v Host>Big tweak in the expansion of our consciousness.</v>

235
00:12:20.424 --> 00:12:23.094
<v ->It wouldn't lower the price of socks at Walmart,</v>

236
00:12:23.094 --> 00:12:25.564
but for those capable of thinking.

237
00:12:25.564 --> 00:12:27.366
<v Host>It would increase tourism to Egypt, however.</v>

238
00:12:27.366 --> 00:12:28.833
<v ->It would.</v>

239
00:12:28.833 --> 00:12:30.267
<v Host>Which is good for you and a lot of people.</v>

240
00:12:30.267 --> 00:12:31.502
<v ->Well, actually this is something I had with Zahi</v>

241
00:12:31.502 --> 00:12:33.971
when we had our,

242
00:12:33.971 --> 00:12:36.142
these quite friendly meetings.

243
00:12:36.142 --> 00:12:40.279
Saying look Zahi, you may disagree with the theory,

244
00:12:40.279 --> 00:12:43.483
but as far as the draw to Egypt, our Sphinx material

245
00:12:43.483 --> 00:12:46.017
and that video, the Charleston Heston video,

246
00:12:46.017 --> 00:12:50.288
was the biggest attraction for Egyptian visitors

247
00:12:50.288 --> 00:12:52.223
since Tutankhamen's tomb.

248
00:12:52.223 --> 00:12:55.360
And Zahi says, yes John, you are right on that.

249
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.294
<v Host>How does this wash with another</v>

250
00:12:57.294 --> 00:13:00.231
of your favorite subjects we won't go into too much,

251
00:13:00.231 --> 00:13:02.833
but Darwinism.

252
00:13:02.833 --> 00:13:06.070
<v ->We live, complicated subject but,</v>

253
00:13:08.939 --> 00:13:11.308
we live in what I call the Church of Progress

254
00:13:11.308 --> 00:13:15.413
which is a church in the most pejorative sense of the word.

255
00:13:15.413 --> 00:13:17.581
It has a dogma which is that A, we are the most

256
00:13:17.581 --> 00:13:19.651
advanced people on earth.

257
00:13:19.651 --> 00:13:24.122
B, that civilization goes in a straight line

258
00:13:24.122 --> 00:13:29.122
from primitive apes, caveman types with their stone axes,

259
00:13:29.761 --> 00:13:32.564
to us with our wonderful...

260
00:13:32.564 --> 00:13:33.464
<v Host>iPods.</v>

261
00:13:33.464 --> 00:13:35.670
<v ->iPods, iPods are part of it.</v>

262
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.701
Not necessarily the best part.

263
00:13:37.701 --> 00:13:39.570
I mean the best part are the hydrogen bombs

264
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.506
and the bacteriological and chemical warfare.

265
00:13:42.506 --> 00:13:44.108
And then there are the bobblehead dolls

266
00:13:44.108 --> 00:13:46.411
and Disneyland and Walmart.

267
00:13:46.411 --> 00:13:47.612
<v Host>And as you said, stripey toothpaste.</v>

268
00:13:47.612 --> 00:13:48.946
<v ->And striped toothpaste.</v>

269
00:13:48.946 --> 00:13:52.616
All of these are the, let's say

270
00:13:52.616 --> 00:13:56.120
the food of the Church of Progress.

271
00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.788
And the Church of Progress itself

272
00:13:57.788 --> 00:14:01.091
that's a part of its dogma.

273
00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:04.428
The other part of its dogma is that we are meaningless

274
00:14:04.428 --> 00:14:07.832
glitches in an accidental universe.

275
00:14:07.832 --> 00:14:10.905
There is no such thing as divinity.

276
00:14:10.905 --> 00:14:14.972
Sacred is a polite word for superstition.

277
00:14:14.972 --> 00:14:16.573
Life is effectively meaningless.

278
00:14:16.573 --> 00:14:17.941
And there are some wonderful quotes

279
00:14:17.941 --> 00:14:19.743
Betrand Russell provided when I didn't have time

280
00:14:19.743 --> 00:14:23.681
to do that this morning about positively reveling

281
00:14:23.681 --> 00:14:26.351
in the fact that there's no point to human life.

282
00:14:26.351 --> 00:14:31.351
And despair is the only thing, the only valid response

283
00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.493
to the condition that we're in.

284
00:14:35.493 --> 00:14:38.495
But like spiritual John Waynes and Clint Eastwoods

285
00:14:38.495 --> 00:14:42.499
we stride into the future with flinty eyes accepting,

286
00:14:42.499 --> 00:14:43.835
<v Host>For what?</v>

287
00:14:43.835 --> 00:14:46.671
<v ->Accepting that death is our destiny and that's it.</v>

288
00:14:46.671 --> 00:14:48.439
Well, that's the Church of Progress.

289
00:14:48.439 --> 00:14:51.741
And what backs that up, the underlying dogma

290
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:55.413
passed off as science is Darwinian evolution.

291
00:14:55.413 --> 00:15:00.284
Which again is constructed in such a way, supposedly,

292
00:15:00.284 --> 00:15:01.820
as science.

293
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.454
But it isn't actually.

294
00:15:03.454 --> 00:15:05.689
It's probably the biggest fraud ever foisted

295
00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:07.858
upon the human race.

296
00:15:07.858 --> 00:15:11.328
And it's that Dawkins, Richard Dawkins,

297
00:15:11.328 --> 00:15:13.831
who along with Daniel Dennett, I describe

298
00:15:13.831 --> 00:15:18.502
as the co-commandants of the latter day Darwin-ugens.

299
00:15:18.502 --> 00:15:21.711
These are the champions of meaningless, as it were.

300
00:15:21.711 --> 00:15:26.243
And they insist on calling Darwinian evolution science

301
00:15:26.243 --> 00:15:29.146
that's fueled by natural selection.

302
00:15:29.146 --> 00:15:31.815
But this is the thing I have coming up shortly,

303
00:15:31.815 --> 00:15:33.617
it will be on my blog.

304
00:15:33.617 --> 00:15:35.754
I don't have it developed enough,

305
00:15:35.754 --> 00:15:38.022
really I don't want to get it out there quite yet.

306
00:15:38.022 --> 00:15:39.857
But effectively, when you look at the language

307
00:15:39.857 --> 00:15:44.828
that science uses in order to promote this fraud,

308
00:15:44.828 --> 00:15:48.699
you'll find that it is the exact equivalent of what

309
00:15:48.699 --> 00:15:53.337
George Orwell described as newspeak in the political arena.

310
00:15:53.337 --> 00:15:57.777
In other words, words are used opposite to what they,

311
00:15:57.777 --> 00:16:00.453
words are used,

312
00:16:00.453 --> 00:16:03.714
words that are in common parlance,

313
00:16:03.714 --> 00:16:05.783
and that mean something quite definite,

314
00:16:05.783 --> 00:16:10.389
are used in such a way to mean exactly their opposites.

315
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:13.858
And natural selection is the first of those.

316
00:16:13.858 --> 00:16:18.858
Natural is used as a synonym for accidental, or chance.

317
00:16:19.296 --> 00:16:23.467
And selection is used as another adjective,

318
00:16:23.467 --> 00:16:25.269
or in this case what is it, noun.

319
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:29.573
Also suggesting chance or accident.

320
00:16:29.573 --> 00:16:32.010
But if you look at those words, nature, natural

321
00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:34.445
refers to the natural world.

322
00:16:34.445 --> 00:16:36.914
And who says that the idea is to prove

323
00:16:36.914 --> 00:16:39.016
that the natural world is chance?

324
00:16:39.016 --> 00:16:43.120
They're taking it for granted as a premise that it's chance.

325
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.488
And that's like going onto a trial at law

326
00:16:45.488 --> 00:16:47.490
and calling the defendant the guilty.

327
00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:49.327
Start calling the defendant the guilty,

328
00:16:49.327 --> 00:16:51.462
the trial's over before you start.

329
00:16:51.462 --> 00:16:55.534
Selection, select, you select players for the NBA draft.

330
00:16:55.534 --> 00:16:57.934
You select candidates to run for office.

331
00:16:57.934 --> 00:17:00.170
The roulette ball does not select the number

332
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:03.940
that it's going to land on, nor does the croupier select it.

333
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.944
Nor does the wheel select it, anyway,

334
00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:11.816
it is the luck of the draw basically.

335
00:17:11.816 --> 00:17:16.816
So two words to select normally means intention,

336
00:17:17.091 --> 00:17:19.255
conscious intention, choice.

337
00:17:19.255 --> 00:17:23.094
So two words that mean, in the one sense, nature,

338
00:17:23.094 --> 00:17:26.830
hierarchical, unbelievable hierarchically

339
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:29.000
precise organization.

340
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.735
And selection, deliberate or conscious choice,

341
00:17:31.735 --> 00:17:35.106
are used to describe what is held to be an absolute

342
00:17:35.106 --> 00:17:36.741
chance process.

343
00:17:36.741 --> 00:17:37.742
And you look through all the rest

344
00:17:37.742 --> 00:17:42.446
of the lexicon of Darwinian language,

345
00:17:42.446 --> 00:17:44.648
you find it's also science speak.

346
00:17:44.648 --> 00:17:48.786
It also has a value or a choice written into it,

347
00:17:48.786 --> 00:17:50.320
biological advantage,

348
00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:54.229
survival of the fittest, although that's no longer

349
00:17:54.229 --> 00:17:58.496
even the Darwinians realize that's no longer appropriate.

350
00:17:58.496 --> 00:18:01.298
But all of the rest of selection pressure,

351
00:18:01.298 --> 00:18:06.298
all the rest of the barrage of baloney

352
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:11.470
of science speak that comes at us to defend

353
00:18:11.975 --> 00:18:14.979
this fraudulent position,

354
00:18:14.979 --> 00:18:19.251
buttresses the, in other words, that's what's behind

355
00:18:19.251 --> 00:18:24.022
the Darwinian argument when to appropriately describe

356
00:18:24.022 --> 00:18:29.022
the Dawkins says,

357
00:18:29.093 --> 00:18:33.030
champions Darwin, because he says

358
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.667
Darwin made atheism respectable.

359
00:18:36.667 --> 00:18:39.936
As if why should respectability matter

360
00:18:39.936 --> 00:18:41.939
in an accidental world?

361
00:18:41.939 --> 00:18:44.880
But what is its survival value?

362
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.010
Why should you care?

363
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:50.981
If it's the truth, why does have to be respectable?

364
00:18:50.981 --> 00:18:53.317
<v Host>Do you think this was his genuine point of view,</v>

365
00:18:53.317 --> 00:18:58.317
these were genuine belief systems or valid theories

366
00:18:58.388 --> 00:18:59.222
in their own mind?

367
00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:00.990
Or do you think this was something that was more

368
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:05.796
deliberately foisted upon mass consciousness?

369
00:19:05.796 --> 00:19:07.231
<v ->Oh no, they don't know any better.</v>

370
00:19:07.231 --> 00:19:10.567
I mean, in other words, this whole business,

371
00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:13.738
this is the religion, the Church of Progress.

372
00:19:13.738 --> 00:19:16.307
This is the religion of the emotionally defective

373
00:19:16.307 --> 00:19:19.710
and the spiritually dyslexic.

374
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.879
And to, put it another way,

375
00:19:21.879 --> 00:19:26.879
nobody is surprised when the eunuchs snigger

376
00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:30.387
behind the sultan's back and deride his passion.

377
00:19:30.387 --> 00:19:33.490
But when they call their own tragic disability reason

378
00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:35.926
and take over the palace, which is exactly what's happened,

379
00:19:35.926 --> 00:19:38.162
the empire is doomed.

380
00:19:38.162 --> 00:19:43.162
No, these people absolutely believe what they're saying.

381
00:19:43.568 --> 00:19:46.270
They call it reason, but it's not reason.

382
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.639
It's actually the rationalization of their own

383
00:19:48.639 --> 00:19:49.973
inner emptiness.

384
00:19:49.973 --> 00:19:52.443
And it is supported by this

385
00:19:52.443 --> 00:19:56.747
by this body of science speak.

386
00:19:56.747 --> 00:20:01.747
They trip themselves up, Dawkins and his colleague

387
00:20:02.585 --> 00:20:06.159
are independent of basically colleague

388
00:20:06.159 --> 00:20:08.525
in making the most noise in the pro-Darwin

389
00:20:08.525 --> 00:20:10.695
position is a man called Daniel Dennett

390
00:20:10.695 --> 00:20:15.132
who furiously rebutted one of this critics by saying

391
00:20:15.132 --> 00:20:19.103
science knows that it's all a series of lucky coincidences.

392
00:20:19.103 --> 00:20:23.607
Now, even that has a value judgement written into it.

393
00:20:23.607 --> 00:20:26.043
But if suddenly natural selection were called

394
00:20:26.043 --> 00:20:28.212
the theory of lucky coincidences,

395
00:20:28.212 --> 00:20:31.749
or some other set of words that actually describes

396
00:20:31.749 --> 00:20:33.350
what they're saying, you know,

397
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.585
haphazard conglomeration,

398
00:20:35.585 --> 00:20:38.922
hierarchically precise chance-acretion.

399
00:20:38.922 --> 00:20:40.695
Some weird thing like that.

400
00:20:40.695 --> 00:20:41.894
This is what they're saying.

401
00:20:41.894 --> 00:20:43.298
<v Host>It would have far less...</v>

402
00:20:43.298 --> 00:20:45.529
<v ->Well the whole thing would dissolve,</v>

403
00:20:45.529 --> 00:20:48.766
even in the public mind into the fraud that it is.

404
00:20:48.766 --> 00:20:50.868
As I said in there, actually.

405
00:20:50.868 --> 00:20:53.905
<v Host>But this has had really a devastating impact</v>

406
00:20:53.905 --> 00:20:56.006
on the deep collective psyche.

407
00:20:56.006 --> 00:20:56.774
<v ->That's right, it has.</v>

408
00:20:56.774 --> 00:20:59.810
<v Host>As you say, this meaningless dance of life</v>

409
00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:00.878
marching toward death.

410
00:21:00.878 --> 00:21:02.413
<v ->That's right, that's it.</v>

411
00:21:02.413 --> 00:21:06.751
And even those who are simply passively accepting

412
00:21:06.751 --> 00:21:10.520
this garbage as gospel are affected by it.

413
00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:15.059
It's one of the reasons why, underlying all the Walmarts,

414
00:21:15.059 --> 00:21:17.361
and all the bobblehead dolls, and all the stupidity

415
00:21:17.361 --> 00:21:21.998
that human life is today is this fraudulent doctrine.

416
00:21:21.998 --> 00:21:26.998
So, the overthrowing of that doctrine is,

417
00:21:27.504 --> 00:21:29.540
even though it doesn't look it,

418
00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:32.945
perhaps one of the most important things that anybody,

419
00:21:32.945 --> 00:21:37.013
or any set of people can do to reverse the pickle

420
00:21:37.013 --> 00:21:40.217
that the human race finds itself in today.

421
00:21:40.217 --> 00:21:43.887
<v Host>I can possibly wish you more luck</v>

422
00:21:43.887 --> 00:21:47.491
in anything than doing that one thing

423
00:21:47.491 --> 00:21:51.238
because I've never thought about it until I heard you

424
00:21:51.238 --> 00:21:52.267
speak about this.

425
00:21:52.267 --> 00:21:54.497
It has bankrupted us spiritually.

426
00:21:54.497 --> 00:21:56.766
<v ->And it's a very strange thing.</v>

427
00:21:56.766 --> 00:21:58.902
<v Host>And that's not to say</v>

428
00:21:58.902 --> 00:22:00.270
that you're a creationist either.

429
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:01.605
<v ->That's the whole point.</v>

430
00:22:01.605 --> 00:22:04.541
Darwinians all voted for George W. Bush

431
00:22:04.541 --> 00:22:06.646
because they share his logic.

432
00:22:06.646 --> 00:22:09.112
Either you're with us, or you're with the terrorists.

433
00:22:09.112 --> 00:22:11.049
So, with the Darwinians, either you're with us

434
00:22:11.049 --> 00:22:12.649
or you're a creationist.

435
00:22:12.649 --> 00:22:14.518
The same fraudulent logic.

436
00:22:14.518 --> 00:22:16.155
Why can't you be against both?

437
00:22:16.155 --> 00:22:16.987
I am.

438
00:22:16.987 --> 00:22:18.188
<v Host>So when you're against both,</v>

439
00:22:18.188 --> 00:22:21.091
and why don't you articulate what you are for?

440
00:22:21.091 --> 00:22:22.626
<v ->Well, that's more difficult actually.</v>

441
00:22:22.626 --> 00:22:27.164
Because, that really is difficult because it postulates

442
00:22:27.164 --> 00:22:30.804
not a god up there who says let there be mosquitoes,

443
00:22:30.804 --> 00:22:32.203
and there are mosquitoes.

444
00:22:32.203 --> 00:22:35.239
But it postulates another level of consciousness,

445
00:22:35.239 --> 00:22:38.008
of creative consciousness to which we do not have

446
00:22:38.008 --> 00:22:40.043
normal access.

447
00:22:40.043 --> 00:22:42.645
And that's the problem because in the Church of Progress

448
00:22:42.645 --> 00:22:44.815
we're the highest conscious beings that exist

449
00:22:44.815 --> 00:22:46.186
in the universe.

450
00:22:46.186 --> 00:22:49.185
To all the other ancient civilizations,

451
00:22:49.185 --> 00:22:50.890
we are in the middle somewhere.

452
00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:54.391
In other words, there is an initiating force

453
00:22:54.391 --> 00:22:58.428
that goes down through a hierarchy of, let's say,

454
00:22:58.428 --> 00:23:00.597
organizing levels.

455
00:23:00.597 --> 00:23:02.933
Actually this leaks into Christianity even

456
00:23:02.933 --> 00:23:04.668
with the archangels and the angels.

457
00:23:04.668 --> 00:23:06.503
And this is the same all over the world.

458
00:23:06.503 --> 00:23:10.273
That's actually cosmology, it's not myth and legend.

459
00:23:10.273 --> 00:23:12.375
Or, rather you could say it is myth and legend,

460
00:23:12.375 --> 00:23:14.711
but behind the myth and legend there is

461
00:23:14.711 --> 00:23:18.781
an intricate and sophisticated cosmology.

462
00:23:18.781 --> 00:23:21.518
And so, just as we, we don't know this,

463
00:23:21.518 --> 00:23:25.822
but we would not expect the cells in our body

464
00:23:25.822 --> 00:23:27.524
who have their own kind of,

465
00:23:27.524 --> 00:23:29.393
let's say they have their own kind of intelligence

466
00:23:29.393 --> 00:23:31.962
and sensitivity to understand what's going on

467
00:23:31.962 --> 00:23:33.129
through our heads.

468
00:23:33.129 --> 00:23:36.366
I mean, I find it hard to imagine that the beleaguered

469
00:23:36.366 --> 00:23:39.769
liver cell in the liver of an alcoholic understands

470
00:23:39.769 --> 00:23:41.906
why he's so unhappy.

471
00:23:41.906 --> 00:23:46.609
By the same token, we don't know what, Lovelock

472
00:23:46.609 --> 00:23:48.811
was on the right idea with his Gaia theory,

473
00:23:48.811 --> 00:23:52.115
but shied away from its mystical implications.

474
00:23:52.115 --> 00:23:57.021
We don't know really what's in the mind of Gaia,

475
00:23:57.021 --> 00:24:01.358
but the lower, the way hierarchies work is

476
00:24:01.358 --> 00:24:04.895
the lower, the higher understands

477
00:24:04.895 --> 00:24:07.664
and in theory controls the lower.

478
00:24:07.664 --> 00:24:11.334
The lower does not understand, but can disrupt the higher.

479
00:24:11.334 --> 00:24:13.469
In other words, the chef runs the restaurant

480
00:24:13.469 --> 00:24:16.772
but if the dishwashers get all Bolshevik,

481
00:24:16.772 --> 00:24:19.342
or I mean if they're treated wrong they will revolt

482
00:24:19.342 --> 00:24:22.663
at a certain point and bring down the organism.

483
00:24:22.663 --> 00:24:24.347
They'll bring down the restaurant.

484
00:24:24.347 --> 00:24:26.217
So it's something of that nature.

485
00:24:26.217 --> 00:24:29.553
In other words, very difficult to articulate.

486
00:24:29.553 --> 00:24:34.324
Relatively easy to prove that evolution through

487
00:24:34.324 --> 00:24:37.093
natural selection is a fraud.

488
00:24:37.093 --> 00:24:39.563
Difficult to, and this is one of the strong points,

489
00:24:39.563 --> 00:24:43.267
this is one of the cards seized by the evolutionists,

490
00:24:43.267 --> 00:24:45.737
to say well if it isn't this what it is?

491
00:24:45.737 --> 00:24:50.391
There are some things that by nature are,

492
00:24:52.346 --> 00:24:54.846
perhaps even impossible to prove.

493
00:24:54.846 --> 00:24:57.181
We just don't know and yet we know they're real.

494
00:24:57.181 --> 00:24:59.082
<v Host>But isn't the acceptance of the notion</v>

495
00:24:59.082 --> 00:25:01.718
that advanced civilizations have been here before

496
00:25:01.718 --> 00:25:03.795
with these higher understanding spiritually,

497
00:25:03.795 --> 00:25:07.123
may be a path of inquiry to begin to understand this?

498
00:25:07.123 --> 00:25:08.859
<v ->That's exactly the path of inquiry</v>

499
00:25:08.859 --> 00:25:11.695
because that's why the past is important.

500
00:25:11.695 --> 00:25:13.197
Otherwise who'd care?

501
00:25:13.197 --> 00:25:16.533
But they provide kind of a template for how

502
00:25:16.533 --> 00:25:18.435
civilizations should work.

503
00:25:18.435 --> 00:25:20.704
When people know that we're here for a purpose

504
00:25:20.704 --> 00:25:22.473
individually and collectively,

505
00:25:22.473 --> 00:25:24.475
and act upon that understanding,

506
00:25:24.475 --> 00:25:28.209
and this of course, is anathema to the Church of Progress

507
00:25:28.209 --> 00:25:31.448
because the central dogma is that there can't have been

508
00:25:31.448 --> 00:25:34.217
anybody as evolved as us and life is meaningless.

509
00:25:34.217 --> 00:25:35.622
And anybody who says that it's otherwise

510
00:25:35.622 --> 00:25:39.656
that we have a purpose, a really purpose in this lifetime,

511
00:25:39.656 --> 00:25:44.194
sorry, in this cosmos, and that our job is to realize

512
00:25:44.194 --> 00:25:48.465
that, our job is to realize that purpose.

513
00:25:48.465 --> 00:25:51.601
That's when a civilization gets started.

514
00:25:51.601 --> 00:25:53.970
So they are, as I said, for a variety of reasons

515
00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:56.977
you cannot expect the eunuchs to suddenly,

516
00:25:56.977 --> 00:26:01.977
to suddenly celebrate when something comes along

517
00:26:02.646 --> 00:26:05.615
that calls attention to their disability.

518
00:26:05.615 --> 00:26:10.453
<v Host>Right, and yet you have this dichotomy here</v>

519
00:26:10.453 --> 00:26:14.858
where in those beautiful pre-dawn hours

520
00:26:14.858 --> 00:26:18.028
where the energy is really saturated and rising,

521
00:26:18.028 --> 00:26:21.234
you have people going to mediation.

522
00:26:21.234 --> 00:26:24.237
You have the yogis, you have the Tibetan monks,

523
00:26:24.237 --> 00:26:25.769
and so forth going into.

524
00:26:25.769 --> 00:26:27.808
And you have the, even in the Christian tradition,

525
00:26:27.808 --> 00:26:31.608
the coming forth and going into these hours

526
00:26:31.608 --> 00:26:34.244
of self-discovery and exploration.

527
00:26:34.244 --> 00:26:36.279
And connecting with the divine.

528
00:26:36.279 --> 00:26:39.316
While the rest of the people wake up at three or four

529
00:26:39.316 --> 00:26:41.818
in the morning in terror of their own mortality

530
00:26:41.818 --> 00:26:44.089
because they can't figure this picture out.

531
00:26:44.089 --> 00:26:47.190
<v ->Well if they do, but nevertheless if you're a eunuch</v>

532
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.527
you can't suddenly discover sex.

533
00:26:49.527 --> 00:26:53.063
So as I said, if you're emotionally defective

534
00:26:53.063 --> 00:26:56.568
and spiritually dyslexic, it's not going to work.

535
00:26:56.568 --> 00:26:57.912
<v Host>What's your remedy?</v>

536
00:26:57.912 --> 00:26:59.711
What's your remedy for where we are right now?

537
00:26:59.711 --> 00:27:01.205
Church of Progress, for everybody who's buying

538
00:27:01.205 --> 00:27:03.640
into the Church of Progress, what's your remedy?

539
00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:07.543
<v ->There's no real remedy other than to bring out</v>

540
00:27:07.543 --> 00:27:09.913
to make the knowledge as public as possible.

541
00:27:09.913 --> 00:27:12.020
And hope that there are some out there

542
00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:17.020
who are not hopelessly, I mean, they're let's say

543
00:27:17.354 --> 00:27:21.791
emotionally slow, but they're not incurably

544
00:27:21.791 --> 00:27:23.059
emotionally defective.

545
00:27:23.059 --> 00:27:26.063
And you hope there are some out there who,

546
00:27:26.063 --> 00:27:31.063
even while buying into the Church of Progress,

547
00:27:31.301 --> 00:27:33.637
are not exactly eunuchs yet.

548
00:27:33.637 --> 00:27:36.072
They just don't know how to use the equipment.

549
00:27:36.072 --> 00:27:41.072
So, something of that nature.

550
00:27:41.811 --> 00:27:45.215
<v Host>Graham Hancock says pull out the power source</v>

551
00:27:45.215 --> 00:27:47.184
to your television set number one.

552
00:27:47.184 --> 00:27:48.185
That's a big one.

553
00:27:48.185 --> 00:27:53.185
<v ->It's a start, but somehow or another the alternative</v>

554
00:27:54.224 --> 00:27:57.760
has to be presented to enough people in the right way

555
00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:01.697
at the right time so that at least some of them

556
00:28:01.697 --> 00:28:04.668
recognize that they have to take action on a personal level.

557
00:28:04.668 --> 00:28:06.874
And enough people taking it on a personal level

558
00:28:06.874 --> 00:28:10.040
can lead to a collective level.

559
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.975
But otherwise, they're are a whole bunch of them.

560
00:28:11.975 --> 00:28:16.975
Actually, I invented a class,

561
00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.949
you know the Hindu caste system which goes

562
00:28:18.949 --> 00:28:22.320
the Brahmas, the priests, and the artists,

563
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.454
and the warriors, and then the merchants,

564
00:28:24.454 --> 00:28:26.756
and then the serfs or the servants,

565
00:28:26.756 --> 00:28:31.227
and then later on I think added, regun,

566
00:28:31.227 --> 00:28:32.829
these are the untouchables.

567
00:28:32.829 --> 00:28:36.065
Now in this deep, dark age there's a caste even below

568
00:28:36.065 --> 00:28:40.137
the untouchables, and that is the unoopadetias,

569
00:28:40.137 --> 00:28:42.873
the Sanskrit word, these are the unteachables.

570
00:28:42.873 --> 00:28:44.941
Nothing is going to reach them.

571
00:28:44.941 --> 00:28:49.941
So the objective is simply to neutralize them

572
00:28:49.981 --> 00:28:52.683
and to present an alternative to enough people

573
00:28:52.683 --> 00:28:54.385
and hope for the best.

574
00:28:54.385 --> 00:28:55.419
That's all we can do.

575
00:28:55.419 --> 00:28:57.754
Signing petitions isn't going to do any good.

576
00:28:57.754 --> 00:28:59.857
<v Host>You're right, we're past that.</v>

577
00:28:59.857 --> 00:29:02.025
So when are you going off on this expedition?

578
00:29:02.025 --> 00:29:03.894
<v ->Oh, with the geo-panel,</v>

579
00:29:03.894 --> 00:29:05.695
well we've got to put it together now.

580
00:29:05.695 --> 00:29:07.131
And while we're on the subject here,

581
00:29:07.131 --> 00:29:10.032
anybody watching perhaps, we're putting together

582
00:29:10.032 --> 00:29:12.202
our panel of geologists.

583
00:29:12.202 --> 00:29:14.770
We're looking for participating geologists

584
00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:17.307
with the right kinds of credentials.

585
00:29:17.307 --> 00:29:20.144
And if anybody watching is such a geologist

586
00:29:20.144 --> 00:29:23.013
or knows such a geologist, they get in touch

587
00:29:23.013 --> 00:29:24.982
and with a bit of luck some time next year.

588
00:29:24.982 --> 00:29:28.451
The funding, would be nice if a friendly billionaire

589
00:29:28.451 --> 00:29:31.558
is listening in and says okay guys, how much do you need

590
00:29:31.558 --> 00:29:32.524
and here it is.

591
00:29:32.524 --> 00:29:33.522
Not a hell of a lot actually.

592
00:29:33.522 --> 00:29:34.643
<v Host>There you go, any billionaires watching.</v>

593
00:29:34.643 --> 00:29:36.993
<v ->Or even multi-millionaires will do.</v>

594
00:29:36.993 --> 00:29:39.429
And then we'll go over there.

595
00:29:39.429 --> 00:29:42.198
And then my feeling is that just as our mystery

596
00:29:42.198 --> 00:29:44.201
of the Sphinx was a kind of watershed event,

597
00:29:44.201 --> 00:29:47.570
that a successful report from the geo-panel

598
00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:51.741
would generate again, massive publicity

599
00:29:51.741 --> 00:29:56.741
and probably a sequel to Son of Mystery of the Sphinx.

600
00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:01.350
And with enough noise, the time is getting close to right.

601
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:05.889
And with enough noise, intelligently directed,

602
00:30:05.889 --> 00:30:07.258
and maybe things change.

603
00:30:07.258 --> 00:30:11.795
As I said earlier, when ideas change, everything changes.

604
00:30:11.795 --> 00:30:15.899
And at least in theory ideas can change in a hurry.

605
00:30:15.899 --> 00:30:17.583
So we'll see.

606
00:30:18.376 --> 00:30:20.203

Meanwhile, to delve further into this subject,

609
00:30:24.741 --> 00:30:26.342
you may want to take a look at our interview

with his fellow Egyptologist and colleague,

611
00:30:28.779 --> 00:30:30.012
Robert Schoch.

612
00:30:30.012 --> 00:30:31.681
And if you haven't seen our first interview

613
00:30:31.681 --> 00:30:33.528
