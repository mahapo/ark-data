00:00:00.636 --> 00:00:02.514
<v ->Wayne Dyer, Michael Beckwith,</v>

2
00:00:02.514 --> 00:00:04.996
and tens of thousands of others have experienced

3
00:00:04.996 --> 00:00:06.936
the technology of Stephen Lewis,

4
00:00:06.936 --> 00:00:09.240
the creator of the AIM program.

5
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.205
AIM sounds innocuous enough at face value,

6
00:00:12.205 --> 00:00:14.529
but this is a profound form of healing

7
00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:17.105
that works with the consciousness of the quantum field

8
00:00:17.105 --> 00:00:19.148
interfacing with technology.

9
00:00:19.148 --> 00:00:21.550
This technology is said to be able to identify

10
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.187
any imbalance in your energy field

11
00:00:24.187 --> 00:00:28.289
and heal it both before and after disease manifests,

12
00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.926
even imbalances that are not natural to man.

(ambient music)

14
00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:41.863
Let's just start with your background as a naturopath

15
00:00:41.863 --> 00:00:44.938
and a homeopath, and how that started moving

16
00:00:44.938 --> 00:00:46.981
into the world of quantum mechanics.

17
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.213
<v ->Well, you know, it started very early for me</v>

18
00:00:51.536 --> 00:00:54.275
because my parents, I was kind of a prodigy,

19
00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:56.047
and my parents said, son, do what you gotta do quickly

20
00:00:56.047 --> 00:00:57.689
because we don't live long.

21
00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:58.578
<v Voiceover>Oh.</v>

22
00:00:58.578 --> 00:01:00.324
<v ->Which is an amazing thing to say to a kid.</v>

23
00:01:00.324 --> 00:01:00.993
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:00.993 --> 00:01:03.063
<v ->I think their parenting skills were a little...</v>

25
00:01:04.658 --> 00:01:05.317
But...
<v Voiceover>Did you think</v>

26
00:01:05.317 --> 00:01:07.230
you were gonna die by 11 at that point?

27
00:01:08.493 --> 00:01:10.196
<v ->I used to wonder why they bred.</v>

28
00:01:10.196 --> 00:01:11.692
Now I know why.

29
00:01:11.692 --> 00:01:12.428
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>
<v ->Kay.</v>

30
00:01:12.428 --> 00:01:14.268
There are no accidents in the world.

31
00:01:14.268 --> 00:01:16.732
But, so I became kind of obsessed

32
00:01:16.732 --> 00:01:19.843
with the concept of healing, and I was lucky

33
00:01:19.843 --> 00:01:22.641
in that my grandfather was a mathematician.

34
00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:25.011
He and all his old buddies would sit,

35
00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:27.443
and get drunk, and talk about mathematics,

36
00:01:27.443 --> 00:01:30.315
and physics, and the Kabbalah.

37
00:01:30.315 --> 00:01:33.357
And they doted on me.

38
00:01:33.357 --> 00:01:34.993
And so, it was all ingrained in me,

39
00:01:34.993 --> 00:01:39.927
it was a fusion of all that, and Neils Bohr, David Bohm,

40
00:01:39.927 --> 00:01:42.480
quantum mechanics were coming to ascendancy.

41
00:01:42.897 --> 00:01:46.659
And at the same time, acupuncture,

42
00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.096
and it was a recovery sort of a homeopathy,

43
00:01:49.096 --> 00:01:52.694
and all these things coalesced into

44
00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.060
what became an inevitability for me.

45
00:01:56.405 --> 00:01:59.600
So, then I had to learn how to, as I said to you before,

46
00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:01.066
talk the talk.

47
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.548
I had to learn about anatomy, neurology,

48
00:02:03.548 --> 00:02:06.447
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera 'cause I can't just

49
00:02:06.447 --> 00:02:07.793
restrict myself and say, well,

50
00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:11.722
your arm or your leg, and that's where it all came in.

51
00:02:11.722 --> 00:02:14.828
But my field is the study of consciousness

52
00:02:14.828 --> 00:02:16.612
within quantum mechanics.

53
00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:18.571
That's all I cared about.

54
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:19.566
<v Voiceover>And what you've done,</v>

55
00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:23.208
I think because this subject is so highly esoteric

56
00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:26.065
to most people unless they've really delved into your work

57
00:02:26.065 --> 00:02:29.044
already, to begin understanding the interface

58
00:02:29.044 --> 00:02:30.864
of consciousness in technology,

59
00:02:30.864 --> 00:02:33.909
and I say because there's so much talk about,

60
00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.175
let's just start jumping right into AIM.

61
00:02:36.175 --> 00:02:36.820
<v ->Okay, good.
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about</v>

62
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.723
how this, yeah, that's what you're here for.

63
00:02:38.723 --> 00:02:40.050
So...
<v ->Well, see, but let me say,</v>

64
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.395
I don't think it's esoteric at all.

65
00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:45.653
AIM is a, I call it a spiritual technology,

66
00:02:45.653 --> 00:02:48.088
it's a holographic technology.

67
00:02:48.088 --> 00:02:50.727
But the hologram is only esoteric

68
00:02:50.727 --> 00:02:53.100
if you call it a hologram.

69
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.528
I mean, when Buddha said, spoke of being in the oneness,

70
00:02:56.528 --> 00:02:58.786
was that a holographic statement?

71
00:02:59.342 --> 00:03:02.010
Or when Christ said, what you to least to man, you do to me,

72
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.610
that's the same thing.

73
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.501
If we say we are holograms, then it becomes esoteric.

74
00:03:09.686 --> 00:03:11.981
The point very simply is this, there is no,

75
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:13.450
and this is getting to your question,

76
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.970
there is no separation between consciousness

77
00:03:18.261 --> 00:03:20.435
and spirituality, and healing.

78
00:03:21.591 --> 00:03:24.898
These are the diagnosing, and treating, and curing,

79
00:03:24.898 --> 00:03:26.957
that's different, but healing, spirituality,

80
00:03:26.957 --> 00:03:29.439
and consciousness are the exact same.

81
00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:33.710
Now, I became aware of, I became under the influence

82
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.377
if you will, of Neils Bohr, David Bohm, et cetera,

83
00:03:36.377 --> 00:03:41.141
and I understood that we are connected

84
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:43.082
well, obviously, to everything and everyone

85
00:03:43.082 --> 00:03:44.385
in the entire universe.

86
00:03:44.385 --> 00:03:49.127
But anything unique to you is your hologram.

87
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.995
Whether it's a lock of your hair, and it doesn't matter

88
00:03:52.995 --> 00:03:55.384
where you've had colored or not,

89
00:03:55.384 --> 00:03:57.761
whether it's a drop of blood, saliva,

90
00:03:57.761 --> 00:03:59.349
or your photograph.

91
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:02.730
And people say, well, DNA in this photograph, I can't get,

92
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.091
DNA is the last thing that occurs.

93
00:04:05.472 --> 00:04:07.369
It just tags along.

94
00:04:07.675 --> 00:04:10.081
Neils Bohr, they were right.

95
00:04:10.081 --> 00:04:14.666
We create the material world for better and for worse

96
00:04:15.042 --> 00:04:16.538
with our consciousness.

97
00:04:17.183 --> 00:04:19.757
And so, that's the good news and the bad news.

98
00:04:19.757 --> 00:04:22.025
You've created something you don't like.

99
00:04:22.025 --> 00:04:23.509
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

100
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.038
<v ->You can change it.</v>

101
00:04:25.922 --> 00:04:28.934
But to do that, you must understand to begin with

102
00:04:28.934 --> 00:04:31.185
that we are empowered.

103
00:04:32.192 --> 00:04:33.665
I don't know about your background, Regina,

104
00:04:33.665 --> 00:04:38.355
but I grew up with a total disempowerment in my life.

105
00:04:38.832 --> 00:04:41.279
Thank god for my grandfather and the other guys

106
00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:42.662
who talked kinda funny.

107
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.143
You know?

108
00:04:44.143 --> 00:04:46.047
And, with their Kabbalah.

109
00:04:46.047 --> 00:04:46.717
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

110
00:04:46.717 --> 00:04:48.010
<v ->That did help me quite a bit.</v>

111
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.971
But you know, we grew up saying,

112
00:04:49.971 --> 00:04:51.255
if something's wrong, you go to somebody

113
00:04:51.255 --> 00:04:53.785
who can fix the thing that's wrong,

114
00:04:53.785 --> 00:04:56.904
and if you can't fix it, you're in deep.

115
00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:57.819
<v Voiceover>Doo doo.</v>

116
00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:58.868
<v ->Yeah.</v>

117
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.117
The reality is there is nothing you cannot heal.

118
00:05:02.733 --> 00:05:04.434
But there's so much help out there

119
00:05:04.434 --> 00:05:06.414
to help you heal yourself.

120
00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.831
Whether it's the AIM program, which I consider to be

121
00:05:09.831 --> 00:05:11.489
extraordinary in this sense.

122
00:05:12.173 --> 00:05:13.957
It's the ultimate gadfly.

123
00:05:15.075 --> 00:05:19.049
What it does is force you to focus

124
00:05:19.049 --> 00:05:23.184
on whatever you need to heal at any given level,

125
00:05:23.184 --> 00:05:26.491
whether it's acquired today, acquired 20 years ago,

126
00:05:26.491 --> 00:05:30.124
hereditary, whether it's physical, emotional, spiritual,

127
00:05:30.124 --> 00:05:32.394
if you need to focus on it, you will,

128
00:05:32.394 --> 00:05:34.764
and you'll keep focusing until it's healed.

129
00:05:34.764 --> 00:05:35.887
<v Voiceover>And that doesn't mean, necessarily,</v>

130
00:05:35.887 --> 00:05:38.403
consciously, it can be on a much

131
00:05:38.403 --> 00:05:39.869
higher consciousness.
<v ->Well, it does me consciously</v>

132
00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:42.207
but you know, in terms, yeah.
<v Voiceover>I mean,</v>

133
00:05:42.207 --> 00:05:43.601
not in terms about knowing the specifics.

134
00:05:43.601 --> 00:05:45.236
<v ->Right, but you know there are many things</v>

135
00:05:45.236 --> 00:05:49.635
that you know consciously and can articulate about

136
00:05:49.635 --> 00:05:52.581
that are just totally nowhere near

137
00:05:52.581 --> 00:05:54.643
other people's consciousness.

138
00:05:54.643 --> 00:05:56.842
So, consciousness is a variable.

139
00:05:56.842 --> 00:05:57.701
And...

140
00:05:58.788 --> 00:06:01.572
You know, I've got a cat, a couple of cats.

141
00:06:02.056 --> 00:06:04.926
And when they healed themselves,

142
00:06:04.926 --> 00:06:08.326
I don't think they gave it a name and spoke that, you know?

143
00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:10.497
They've got such a limited vocabulary,

144
00:06:10.497 --> 00:06:14.239
but in the universal language, (foreign language) of life

145
00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:16.303
is consciousness.

146
00:06:16.303 --> 00:06:19.839
It speaks English, French, Dutch, German, doggy, kitty cat.

147
00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:22.660
Whale and plants.

148
00:06:23.036 --> 00:06:25.674
<v Voiceover>Tsetse fly, yeah, all of it.</v>

149
00:06:25.674 --> 00:06:28.382
<v ->Exactly, and that's the field that interested me most</v>

150
00:06:28.382 --> 00:06:31.454
because I realized something, I may not be the best

151
00:06:31.454 --> 00:06:34.726
mathematician or quantum mechanic around,

152
00:06:34.726 --> 00:06:38.209
there are better, but I'll bet you I'm the most pragmatic.

153
00:06:39.293 --> 00:06:42.546
I understood that if this was true, and it is true,

154
00:06:42.925 --> 00:06:44.996
that it was true for all of our lives.

155
00:06:44.996 --> 00:06:47.883
Not just for a lecture in some class.

156
00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:51.670
Which, and that's the difference.

157
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.352
<v Voiceover>So, let's get into the it of it</v>

158
00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.332
because in the book that you wrote, the Sanctuary,

159
00:07:00.751 --> 00:07:04.031
it's a thinly disguised version of your story, right?

160
00:07:04.624 --> 00:07:05.899
Fairly thinly disguised.

161
00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:10.951
<v ->Interim, I was in practice, but it's not a novel.</v>

162
00:07:10.951 --> 00:07:11.421
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

163
00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:13.553
<v ->At the time, I was in practice, and of course,</v>

164
00:07:13.553 --> 00:07:15.716
you can't betray confidentiality.

165
00:07:15.716 --> 00:07:16.420
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

166
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.436
<v ->And so, it was patient confidentiality.</v>

167
00:07:17.436 --> 00:07:18.264
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

168
00:07:18.264 --> 00:07:21.403
<v ->But there's nothing in there that isn't absolutely true.</v>

169
00:07:21.403 --> 00:07:25.301
I took the name Max because the first physics teacher

170
00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:28.640
that knew anything that impacted me was named Max.

171
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.265
I just wanted to say thank you to Max, it was Max Stevens.

172
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:33.905
And yeah, it's all real.

173
00:07:33.905 --> 00:07:36.591
<v Voiceover>So, as we go, as we got into that story,</v>

174
00:07:36.917 --> 00:07:39.720
and the person that was speaking in the first person

175
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.985
was meeting Max, and this whole journey

176
00:07:41.985 --> 00:07:45.205
into this world of technology interfaced with consciousness,

177
00:07:45.205 --> 00:07:47.194
let's talk about how that really came to be

178
00:07:47.194 --> 00:07:49.268
because this is technology and consciousness

179
00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:50.516
working together.

180
00:07:50.516 --> 00:07:54.170
What was the inception of that, say, the ah ha moment

181
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.570
that created that portion of it?

182
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.102
And then we'll go hopscotch through

183
00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:58.338
to what it has become today.
<v ->Sure.</v>

184
00:07:58.338 --> 00:07:59.844
Well, see, I think it's important to understand

185
00:07:59.844 --> 00:08:02.436
that this is a huge field.

186
00:08:02.436 --> 00:08:05.543
And I've only contributed a couple of things in this field.

187
00:08:06.383 --> 00:08:09.064
I mean, I stand on the shoulders of so many giants

188
00:08:10.454 --> 00:08:12.854
in the world of spirituality, and the world of quantum

189
00:08:12.854 --> 00:08:15.274
mechanics, and physics, and on, and on, and on.

190
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:18.360
<v Voiceover>And by resonance field.</v>

191
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.592
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>

192
00:08:19.592 --> 00:08:21.826
Sure, and I pay my homage to people like

193
00:08:21.826 --> 00:08:24.102
Chivel, and Vole, et cetera, et cetera, you know,

194
00:08:24.102 --> 00:08:25.540
and all that, but...

195
00:08:28.032 --> 00:08:32.525
My vision, my quest was to find a language

196
00:08:34.041 --> 00:08:36.987
that was in consciousness.

197
00:08:38.515 --> 00:08:42.152
If everything has a resonance, a resonant rate

198
00:08:42.152 --> 00:08:45.102
within consciousness, okay, what is it?

199
00:08:45.854 --> 00:08:50.188
What's the difference between your hand and your elbow?

200
00:08:50.188 --> 00:08:52.218
And for that matter, your hand and my hand

201
00:08:52.218 --> 00:08:54.582
in the range of hands, et cetera, et cetera.

202
00:08:55.065 --> 00:08:57.736
And that was my vision.

203
00:08:57.736 --> 00:09:00.863
And I think, and I say this without being self effacing

204
00:09:00.863 --> 00:09:05.155
in the least, I think I serve a miracle.

205
00:09:05.668 --> 00:09:07.673
I think that miracle was revealed to me

206
00:09:07.673 --> 00:09:10.058
because of my vision.

207
00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.079
And when, you know, someone says, okay, okay,

208
00:09:12.079 --> 00:09:13.346
you can stop looking, all right?

209
00:09:13.346 --> 00:09:14.795
And that's it.

210
00:09:15.373 --> 00:09:18.116
I am an ordinary person who serves

211
00:09:18.116 --> 00:09:20.924
an unbelievable miracle, and I think that's important

212
00:09:20.924 --> 00:09:23.297
because miracles occur as they're needed.

213
00:09:25.326 --> 00:09:27.730
You know, if they occur before they're needed,

214
00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:28.663
they're inappropriate.

215
00:09:28.663 --> 00:09:31.409
If they occur after they're needed, they're obsolete.

216
00:09:32.031 --> 00:09:33.875
And miracles are always there.

217
00:09:34.637 --> 00:09:37.820
Are we there to perceive them is the question.

218
00:09:38.942 --> 00:09:41.175
<v Voiceover>How, then did you begin connecting</v>

219
00:09:41.175 --> 00:09:45.125
with the notion of these very refined resonance forces?

220
00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:47.938
And being able to actually define them,

221
00:09:47.938 --> 00:09:49.317
as you say, a difference between the

222
00:09:49.317 --> 00:09:50.611
frequency of them?
<v ->Well, once I had</v>

223
00:09:50.611 --> 00:09:54.686
that algorithmic equation, if you will,

224
00:09:54.686 --> 00:09:56.690
that was, as I said, revealed to me,

225
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.616
and I wrote about that in the book.

226
00:09:58.616 --> 00:10:02.686
It was in the moment of absolute blind terror

227
00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:03.529
that had came to me.

228
00:10:03.529 --> 00:10:04.289
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

229
00:10:04.289 --> 00:10:05.653
<v ->Okay, you know?</v>

230
00:10:05.993 --> 00:10:07.695
You see mountain lions in cages,

231
00:10:07.695 --> 00:10:09.375
they are much bigger when they're 10 feet away,

232
00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:10.467
looking at you.
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

233
00:10:10.467 --> 00:10:11.309
<v ->Okay?</v>

234
00:10:11.309 --> 00:10:12.421
No cage.

235
00:10:13.165 --> 00:10:14.216
They get much bigger.

236
00:10:14.912 --> 00:10:19.252
And so, once I had that algorithm, I ran home

237
00:10:19.252 --> 00:10:20.748
and began to work, and work, and work,

238
00:10:20.748 --> 00:10:24.663
and until I realized, this is real, this is happening.

239
00:10:25.008 --> 00:10:27.658
And that was one, and then it still wouldn't have

240
00:10:27.658 --> 00:10:29.922
contributed, it wouldn't, there would be no AIM program

241
00:10:29.922 --> 00:10:34.156
with just that because I had to find an imbalance

242
00:10:34.156 --> 00:10:36.244
in you, in...

243
00:10:37.769 --> 00:10:41.780
Units of consciousness, and create a remedy in that.

244
00:10:42.501 --> 00:10:46.123
And I did so using, you know, a frequency generator.

245
00:10:47.175 --> 00:10:49.475
And I had to do that, very much, very,

246
00:10:49.475 --> 00:10:52.398
very similar assets to radionics.

247
00:10:52.398 --> 00:10:53.483
Okay?

248
00:10:55.012 --> 00:10:56.726
And something interesting happened.

249
00:10:57.155 --> 00:11:00.417
One of my partners, Evan, kept having a dream

250
00:11:00.417 --> 00:11:02.664
that there was something called a Rosetta frequency.

251
00:11:03.187 --> 00:11:04.306
And I said, no such thing.

252
00:11:05.053 --> 00:11:05.661
Right?

253
00:11:05.661 --> 00:11:07.560
I says, you're dreaming, go back and dream,

254
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.261
just like you said, it was a dream.

255
00:11:09.261 --> 00:11:10.935
But every night, he had this dream.

256
00:11:10.935 --> 00:11:13.833
So, finally, I said, all right, let's see if I can,

257
00:11:13.833 --> 00:11:18.252
and I did figure out a frequency that would

258
00:11:18.252 --> 00:11:23.252
compel you to select every frequency you need

259
00:11:23.667 --> 00:11:28.461
to heal as complimentary healing frequencies,

260
00:11:29.118 --> 00:11:31.514
and ignore the rest of the half million.

261
00:11:31.514 --> 00:11:34.153
That's critically important because nobody

262
00:11:34.153 --> 00:11:37.050
can process a half a million things at one time.

263
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.754
<v Voiceover>Yeah, and but yet, it's very clean and logical</v>

264
00:11:39.754 --> 00:11:40.720
from the quantum point of view.

265
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.732
<v ->Right, no, it is, it is.</v>

266
00:11:42.732 --> 00:11:46.863
So now, you select, and that freed me up at the same time,

267
00:11:46.863 --> 00:11:48.832
has allowed me to bring this to the world

268
00:11:48.832 --> 00:11:52.775
because before, if I didn't find an imbalance in you,

269
00:11:52.775 --> 00:11:55.610
I couldn't give you something to help you balance it,

270
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:56.748
to heal it.

271
00:11:56.748 --> 00:12:00.945
And I'm on the outside scratching, trying to look in

272
00:12:00.945 --> 00:12:03.789
to see, I will miss things.

273
00:12:03.789 --> 00:12:07.373
There isn't a thing in the world you can miss about you.

274
00:12:08.523 --> 00:12:09.992
Nothing, it's all there.

275
00:12:09.992 --> 00:12:12.660
And the fact that you can or cannot articulate it

276
00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.922
makes no difference, just if you put one of these

277
00:12:15.922 --> 00:12:20.922
orange trees on the program, it would make

278
00:12:20.937 --> 00:12:23.602
all the others seem puny and stunted.

279
00:12:25.042 --> 00:12:28.249
So, orange trees speak in consciousness.

280
00:12:28.764 --> 00:12:30.445
It's that similar, I told you, I said about Michael Beckwith

281
00:12:30.445 --> 00:12:31.751
there, didn't I?

282
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:32.666
Yeah.

283
00:12:32.666 --> 00:12:35.173
Yeah, put the rest of his hedge on because one was huge

284
00:12:35.173 --> 00:12:37.389
and the other one, normal size.

285
00:12:39.252 --> 00:12:41.789
So, that's the Rosetta frequency, that's the second

286
00:12:41.789 --> 00:12:46.615
of my revelations, and that allowed the AIM program to be,

287
00:12:47.185 --> 00:12:49.859
because you select what you need,

288
00:12:49.859 --> 00:12:51.594
and ignore all the rest, you select it for as long

289
00:12:51.594 --> 00:12:53.346
as you have to.

290
00:12:54.059 --> 00:12:56.636
And then you're finished selecting.

291
00:12:56.636 --> 00:12:58.365
<v Voiceover>Let's back up a bit and talk about</v>

292
00:12:58.365 --> 00:13:01.176
what the program looked like before with the human being

293
00:13:01.176 --> 00:13:03.265
sitting down with another human being

294
00:13:03.265 --> 00:13:05.216
in a technical interface, what it would have been like

295
00:13:05.216 --> 00:13:06.812
had someone in the early phases

296
00:13:06.812 --> 00:13:09.918
before the AIM portion came to be, coming to you?

297
00:13:09.918 --> 00:13:13.251
<v ->I would have had you hold a ground in your hand</v>

298
00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:16.793
and either put out your thumb, and I would say,

299
00:13:16.793 --> 00:13:19.223
okay, you have this frequency, and that,

300
00:13:19.223 --> 00:13:22.863
and you have the frequency of heart disease

301
00:13:22.863 --> 00:13:26.196
from your father, and et cetera, et cetera.

302
00:13:26.196 --> 00:13:30.364
Or I would put a picture on a tray you proceed in your hand

303
00:13:30.364 --> 00:13:34.344
and said, now, all you are is just an employee, okay?

304
00:13:34.344 --> 00:13:35.401
A witness.

305
00:13:35.401 --> 00:13:38.741
And I'm using you because I need consciousness

306
00:13:38.741 --> 00:13:40.141
to measure things.

307
00:13:40.141 --> 00:13:42.418
But we're really measuring the person in this picture,

308
00:13:42.418 --> 00:13:45.021
or the dog, or the cat, or whatever.

309
00:13:45.021 --> 00:13:48.524
And I would have done that, then created a remedy

310
00:13:48.524 --> 00:13:49.421
for that person.
<v Voiceover>And let's back</v>

311
00:13:49.421 --> 00:13:51.041
up for one moment on the picture.

312
00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:51.787
<v ->Yes.</v>

313
00:13:51.787 --> 00:13:53.059
<v Voiceover>The picture, essentially,</v>

314
00:13:53.059 --> 00:13:56.091
is a representation that is accessing

315
00:13:56.091 --> 00:13:58.431
or representing the quantum field of view?

316
00:13:58.431 --> 00:14:00.471
<v ->It is you, holographically.</v>

317
00:14:00.471 --> 00:14:01.892
<v Voiceover>Right, okay, so, just so</v>

318
00:14:01.892 --> 00:14:02.766
we understand this.
<v ->Because,</v>

319
00:14:02.766 --> 00:14:04.525
remember, someone, in the world of energy

320
00:14:04.525 --> 00:14:08.507
and consciousness, there is no time, there is no space,

321
00:14:08.507 --> 00:14:09.941
there is nothing.

322
00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:12.374
It's like, you know, everyone, it's now high school phsyics

323
00:14:12.374 --> 00:14:16.075
to say, E equals MC squared, everything is energy.

324
00:14:16.075 --> 00:14:18.354
Well, that's fine, but that doesn't tell you anything

325
00:14:18.354 --> 00:14:21.348
because I can tell you everything there is to know

326
00:14:21.348 --> 00:14:23.836
about energy in under 10 seconds, you ready?

327
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:25.713
It is.

328
00:14:26.091 --> 00:14:26.826
<v Voiceover>It is.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

329
00:14:26.826 --> 00:14:27.725
<v Voiceover>That's it.</v>

330
00:14:27.725 --> 00:14:28.791
<v ->How did I do?</v>

331
00:14:28.791 --> 00:14:30.456
<v Voiceover>You did great, under one second.</v>

332
00:14:30.456 --> 00:14:33.654
<v ->Yeah, the point is it doesn't have any properties,</v>

333
00:14:33.654 --> 00:14:35.774
no taste, no smell, no nothing.

334
00:14:35.774 --> 00:14:38.209
It doesn't even have space, doesn't have time,

335
00:14:38.209 --> 00:14:39.503
it just is.

336
00:14:39.503 --> 00:14:44.160
And it is part of all other energy that also just is.

337
00:14:45.139 --> 00:14:46.616
That regards anything else.

338
00:14:46.616 --> 00:14:49.176
So, that's, at the beginning of the work of Neils Bohr

339
00:14:49.176 --> 00:14:53.305
and David Bohm, and all my betters, you know?

340
00:14:53.821 --> 00:14:57.732
If there is a difference in

341
00:14:58.219 --> 00:15:01.195
the components of our life, one person's healthy,

342
00:15:01.195 --> 00:15:02.829
another person's sick as hell.

343
00:15:02.829 --> 00:15:06.936
Someone else is incredibly ecstatic and elated

344
00:15:06.936 --> 00:15:10.106
and someone else is depressed, irrespective of the physical

345
00:15:10.106 --> 00:15:12.868
reasons for it, and on, and on, and on,

346
00:15:12.868 --> 00:15:15.438
what is it that makes that difference?

347
00:15:15.438 --> 00:15:18.637
What is it that makes it, gives it dimensions?

348
00:15:18.637 --> 00:15:20.243
Form?

349
00:15:20.243 --> 00:15:21.518
Okay?

350
00:15:21.518 --> 00:15:23.285
Well, how does it manifest?

351
00:15:23.285 --> 00:15:25.765
Consciousness is what does it.

352
00:15:26.421 --> 00:15:28.949
And so, again, we're back to the beginning of the interview

353
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:33.127
where if you created heart disease,

354
00:15:34.695 --> 00:15:39.385
or misery, or whatever it may be, bitterness,

355
00:15:40.137 --> 00:15:43.540
go uncreate it if you don't like it because

356
00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.670
you are empowered to do it, and once you're empowered,

357
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:48.155
you're responsible.

358
00:15:48.843 --> 00:15:50.515
<v Voiceover>And this is a big issue.</v>

359
00:15:50.515 --> 00:15:52.317
A lot of people don't have, are not accustomed

360
00:15:52.317 --> 00:15:54.207
to having to be responsible anymore,

361
00:15:54.207 --> 00:15:57.420
but before we go down that route, okay, so they came in,

362
00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.718
you'd hook up the thumb, you'd start evaluating

363
00:15:59.718 --> 00:16:01.480
the frequencies, the resonances, and look for

364
00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.127
the energetic balancing counterpart to that frequency,

365
00:16:04.127 --> 00:16:06.607
and then you'd give them a what?

366
00:16:07.028 --> 00:16:08.721
Then how would you help them from that point

367
00:16:08.721 --> 00:16:09.867
once that was identified?
<v ->I would make,</v>

368
00:16:09.867 --> 00:16:14.128
I would take a solution of alcohol and water,

369
00:16:14.128 --> 00:16:16.867
and using my frequency generator,

370
00:16:16.867 --> 00:16:21.676
generate a healing frequency, one that would totally

371
00:16:21.676 --> 00:16:23.377
counteract that frequency.

372
00:16:23.377 --> 00:16:24.808
And I had a lot of people, I mean, you know,

373
00:16:24.808 --> 00:16:28.412
I had a waiting list for a new patient,

374
00:16:28.412 --> 00:16:30.220
I was working too much as it was,

375
00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.889
a waiting list of three and a half years for a new patient

376
00:16:32.889 --> 00:16:34.479
unless you had a lot of clout.

377
00:16:34.479 --> 00:16:35.187
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

378
00:16:35.187 --> 00:16:35.985
<v Voiceover>I mean, the Rockefellers</v>

379
00:16:35.985 --> 00:16:37.927
didn't wait three and a half years.

380
00:16:37.927 --> 00:16:39.023
And on and on.
<v Voiceover>Jee,</v>

381
00:16:39.023 --> 00:16:39.895
let me guess why.

382
00:16:39.895 --> 00:16:40.586
<v ->Huh?</v>

383
00:16:40.586 --> 00:16:41.422
<v Voiceover>Never mind, I was gonna say,</v>

384
00:16:41.422 --> 00:16:43.081
let me guess why, go ahead.

385
00:16:43.465 --> 00:16:44.308
<v ->Sure.</v>

386
00:16:45.729 --> 00:16:48.021
And I was working too much as it was.

387
00:16:48.021 --> 00:16:49.039
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

388
00:16:49.039 --> 00:16:51.470
<v ->But then I had made a discovery, oh,</v>

389
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.539
12, 13 years ago, and I said, I have a very

390
00:16:54.539 --> 00:16:55.607
clear message here.

391
00:16:55.607 --> 00:16:58.882
I was going to retire, and I had been successful.

392
00:16:58.882 --> 00:17:00.803
I mean, I'm pragmatic, every time I read about somebody

393
00:17:00.803 --> 00:17:04.300
getting $20 million for a movie, I doubled my fees.

394
00:17:05.012 --> 00:17:06.653
And it was mostly the entertainment industry,

395
00:17:06.653 --> 00:17:08.210
and they didn't care.

396
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.780
They would say things like, why are you telling me this?

397
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:11.750
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

398
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.031
<v ->I don't pay my bills, just ask my agent or whatever.</v>

399
00:17:14.031 --> 00:17:14.684
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

400
00:17:14.684 --> 00:17:15.400
<v ->Okay?</v>

401
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.781
They didn't give, they didn't care.

402
00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:20.537
So, I was going to retire and I got a very clear cut message

403
00:17:20.537 --> 00:17:23.912
that it ain't gonna happen maybe ever

404
00:17:25.084 --> 00:17:28.511
because you were given this gift, was the message,

405
00:17:28.511 --> 00:17:32.286
because it must be distributed, it must be given.

406
00:17:32.738 --> 00:17:33.954
It's time for it.

407
00:17:34.644 --> 00:17:35.847
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about the lead to...</v>

408
00:17:35.847 --> 00:17:38.144
<v ->I said, how about Maui, and they said, tough.</v>

409
00:17:38.144 --> 00:17:39.338
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

410
00:17:39.854 --> 00:17:43.162
Well, okay, you no longer have the luxury,

411
00:17:43.162 --> 00:17:45.159
and nor do people wanna go on a four year wait list

412
00:17:45.159 --> 00:17:47.394
by this time, of hooking everyone's finger up

413
00:17:47.394 --> 00:17:49.293
and doing personal evaluations,

414
00:17:49.293 --> 00:17:51.928
so let's do the quantum leap into AIM,

415
00:17:51.928 --> 00:17:54.233
and what happened, what the revelation was

416
00:17:54.233 --> 00:17:56.321
that allowed you to be able to work on,

417
00:17:56.321 --> 00:17:58.072
am I fair in saying, thousands of people

418
00:17:58.072 --> 00:17:59.675
simultaneously, almost?

419
00:17:59.675 --> 00:18:01.740
<v ->Oh, there's 40,000 people who have received</v>

420
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.034
energetic balancing.

421
00:18:03.034 --> 00:18:05.204
<v Voiceover>Okay, let's talk about what that is</v>

422
00:18:05.204 --> 00:18:07.346
in really concrete terms, what happened,

423
00:18:07.346 --> 00:18:09.258
what's that look like, how does it work now?

424
00:18:09.615 --> 00:18:10.725
<v ->Well...</v>

425
00:18:12.408 --> 00:18:15.702
I did an evaluation with you, Regina,

426
00:18:16.183 --> 00:18:17.389
but that's because you're media,

427
00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:19.460
and I wanted to just give you an example,

428
00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.597
'cause you're gonna write about it,

429
00:18:20.597 --> 00:18:22.956
or you're gonna discuss it, disseminate it,

430
00:18:22.956 --> 00:18:27.956
but for the most part, I had several critical questions.

431
00:18:28.101 --> 00:18:29.386
One, are you alive?

432
00:18:30.367 --> 00:18:31.815
We determined that, okay.

433
00:18:32.208 --> 00:18:33.852
Do you have any life force?

434
00:18:33.852 --> 00:18:35.244
What is it, as a matter of fact?

435
00:18:35.244 --> 00:18:38.724
But more importantly, is there any frequency

436
00:18:39.245 --> 00:18:42.615
that leads me to believe you may not be able to heal

437
00:18:42.615 --> 00:18:45.664
everything about yourself using this technology?

438
00:18:46.223 --> 00:18:47.891
'Cause you can heal anything, but can this

439
00:18:47.891 --> 00:18:49.124
technology help you?

440
00:18:49.124 --> 00:18:51.783
And rarely, but occasionally, the answer is,

441
00:18:51.783 --> 00:18:53.322
yes, there is something.

442
00:18:53.322 --> 00:18:54.724
And then we tell people.

443
00:18:54.724 --> 00:18:57.501
But if the answer is, okay, you're alive,

444
00:18:57.501 --> 00:19:01.042
and look like you can stay that way for a while,

445
00:19:01.737 --> 00:19:03.304
I do a little more technically than that,

446
00:19:03.304 --> 00:19:04.204
but it comes down to that.

447
00:19:04.204 --> 00:19:05.407
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

448
00:19:05.407 --> 00:19:08.754
<v ->If that's the, if it's yes, we take your photograph,</v>

449
00:19:08.754 --> 00:19:13.607
we digitize it, and then have it analog'd again

450
00:19:13.607 --> 00:19:17.036
on a huge sheet of paper on huge metal trays,

451
00:19:17.818 --> 00:19:19.609
and those trays are attached to an enormous

452
00:19:19.609 --> 00:19:23.476
bank of computers generating about a half a million

453
00:19:23.476 --> 00:19:26.411
frequencies and balancing frequencies simultaneously.

454
00:19:27.595 --> 00:19:30.439
And this is a composite of the work of our research for

455
00:19:31.585 --> 00:19:32.840
a lot of years.

456
00:19:33.269 --> 00:19:35.112
<v Voiceover>So, the luxury of people,</v>

457
00:19:35.112 --> 00:19:36.773
your luxury, being able to hook 'em up

458
00:19:36.773 --> 00:19:38.874
and talk to them directly, that, (foreign language),

459
00:19:38.874 --> 00:19:40.465
you can't, there isn't enough of you,

460
00:19:40.465 --> 00:19:43.444
but at the same token, I'm sure some people have said,

461
00:19:43.444 --> 00:19:45.848
well, if you can't hook me up and I can't see anyone,

462
00:19:45.848 --> 00:19:47.348
and you won't tell me what's wrong with me,

463
00:19:47.348 --> 00:19:49.776
I don't know that I wanna do this, but in reality,

464
00:19:49.776 --> 00:19:51.852
isn't that quantum information far more important

465
00:19:51.852 --> 00:19:55.379
and might even work better without having that information

466
00:19:55.379 --> 00:19:56.145
in our heads?
<v ->I was working</v>

467
00:19:56.145 --> 00:19:59.123
in the entertainment and music industry in LA,

468
00:19:59.123 --> 00:20:01.623
and a lot of people said, well, if I can't have

469
00:20:01.623 --> 00:20:04.508
your undivided personal attention, I don't wanna do this.

470
00:20:05.026 --> 00:20:07.504
And they miss out on so much.

471
00:20:07.504 --> 00:20:08.420
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

472
00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:09.673
<v ->But there are others like, look,</v>

473
00:20:10.233 --> 00:20:12.408
Courteney Cox, Burt Bacharach, and you've seen

474
00:20:12.408 --> 00:20:14.558
some of the endorsements, who,

475
00:20:15.541 --> 00:20:17.805
this, they bocked a little bit, and I said,

476
00:20:17.805 --> 00:20:20.004
wait a minute, this is even better

477
00:20:20.004 --> 00:20:22.779
because even if you don't find something,

478
00:20:22.779 --> 00:20:23.750
I'll find it, won't I?

479
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:25.323
I said, duh.

480
00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:27.677
<v Voiceover>And the conscious mind can't interfere</v>

481
00:20:27.677 --> 00:20:30.985
with the process by making labels and attachments.

482
00:20:30.985 --> 00:20:32.740
<v ->Precisely, precisely.</v>

483
00:20:33.951 --> 00:20:35.011
I mean...

484
00:20:36.695 --> 00:20:39.159
Most people don't know the technical name

485
00:20:39.159 --> 00:20:41.084
for most medical conditions anyway.

486
00:20:41.702 --> 00:20:42.796
It doesn't matter.

487
00:20:42.796 --> 00:20:45.025
They have that knowledge in their consciousness.

488
00:20:45.431 --> 00:20:48.369
They know exactly what they have,

489
00:20:48.369 --> 00:20:50.393
what they must do, and they're aware of it.

490
00:20:50.936 --> 00:20:52.243
The language is unimportant.

491
00:20:52.243 --> 00:20:53.406
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

492
00:20:53.406 --> 00:20:55.949
It's just like, the mathematics as a language

493
00:20:55.949 --> 00:20:59.335
is unimportant because nobody speaks it.

494
00:21:00.246 --> 00:21:02.436
If language is to communicate, how good is math?

495
00:21:02.882 --> 00:21:03.554
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

496
00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:04.115
<v ->Who talks it?</v>

497
00:21:04.115 --> 00:21:04.894
<v Voiceover>No one would understand</v>

498
00:21:04.894 --> 00:21:06.082
these algorithms, for example,

499
00:21:06.082 --> 00:21:07.781
except maybe you and a few others.

500
00:21:08.186 --> 00:21:09.141
<v ->Yeah, but I mean...</v>

501
00:21:10.497 --> 00:21:11.293
<v Voiceover>Doesn't matter.</v>

502
00:21:11.293 --> 00:21:14.630
<v ->Was it meaningful when, once again,</v>

503
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:17.383
Buddha said what he said about being in the oneness?

504
00:21:17.971 --> 00:21:19.707
The whole principle is that a guiding principle

505
00:21:19.707 --> 00:21:23.341
in our lives forever, and every person

506
00:21:23.341 --> 00:21:25.098
of spirituality perceives it.

507
00:21:26.112 --> 00:21:27.939
And by spirituality, I don't necessarily mean religion,

508
00:21:27.939 --> 00:21:30.611
I mean spirituality, perceives it.

509
00:21:30.611 --> 00:21:31.901
You know, and...

510
00:21:33.308 --> 00:21:34.514
It's kind of funny.

511
00:21:34.514 --> 00:21:38.103
When I was doing work on the holographic principle,

512
00:21:38.576 --> 00:21:42.264
mathematically, at that time, I remember hearing about

513
00:21:42.264 --> 00:21:44.697
aborigines wouldn't let you take their picture

514
00:21:44.697 --> 00:21:46.744
because they thought you'd capture something about them,

515
00:21:46.744 --> 00:21:49.079
and I thought they were superstitious.

516
00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.822
<v Voiceover>And now this is what you do.</v>

517
00:21:51.822 --> 00:21:52.992
<v ->So, what good was the math?</v>

518
00:21:52.992 --> 00:21:53.775
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

519
00:21:53.775 --> 00:21:54.937
<v ->I didn't know what the hell I was talking about.</v>

520
00:21:54.937 --> 00:21:55.805
<v Voiceover>Yeah, exactly.</v>

521
00:21:55.805 --> 00:21:56.675
<v ->Now I understand, yes.</v>

522
00:21:56.675 --> 00:21:57.839
<v Voiceover>Okay, so, we have an idea</v>

523
00:21:57.839 --> 00:21:59.882
of how this functionally works, essentially.

524
00:21:59.882 --> 00:22:02.185
A person would call you up and,

525
00:22:02.185 --> 00:22:04.111
or your organization up, and a photograph would be

526
00:22:04.111 --> 00:22:05.784
worked with, and these trays, working with these half

527
00:22:05.784 --> 00:22:08.790
a million frequencies, let's talk about the nature

528
00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.890
of these energetic imbalances directly.

529
00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:13.929
For example, the difference between hereditary,

530
00:22:13.929 --> 00:22:17.458
active, and so forth, and what each of us is dealing with

531
00:22:17.458 --> 00:22:21.405
on this planet in relationship to life force.

532
00:22:21.405 --> 00:22:25.397
<v ->Okay, first of all, 15 years ago,</v>

533
00:22:25.397 --> 00:22:28.111
if I had done that little mini evaluation for you, Regina,

534
00:22:28.111 --> 00:22:30.139
I think I told you your life force would have been

535
00:22:30.139 --> 00:22:33.944
between 95 and 99 as an average.

536
00:22:33.944 --> 00:22:34.947
<v Voiceover>Out of 100.</v>

537
00:22:34.947 --> 00:22:37.166
<v ->Out of 100, a scale of 100, yes.</v>

538
00:22:37.823 --> 00:22:41.022
Maybe eight, nine years ago, if I had done it,

539
00:22:41.022 --> 00:22:45.194
your life force would have been 65, 68,

540
00:22:45.194 --> 00:22:46.459
something to that sort.

541
00:22:46.459 --> 00:22:48.517
When people like Wayne Dyer, Michael Beckwith,

542
00:22:48.517 --> 00:22:50.790
and many others got in the AIM program,

543
00:22:52.961 --> 00:22:55.998
now, your life was very close to 70.

544
00:22:55.998 --> 00:22:57.032
<v Voiceover>Right, which you say,</v>

545
00:22:57.032 --> 00:22:58.967
this is kind of the range we're falling into as a species.

546
00:22:58.967 --> 00:23:00.331
<v ->It's mostly ones.</v>

547
00:23:00.331 --> 00:23:02.610
<v Voiceover>One to seven, hold on a minute.</v>

548
00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:04.609
That would, most of anyone listening to this

549
00:23:04.609 --> 00:23:06.949
would say, my god, she and the rest of us

550
00:23:06.949 --> 00:23:09.667
are virtually among the walking dead.

551
00:23:10.742 --> 00:23:12.147
<v ->No, dead is zero, my dear.</v>

552
00:23:12.147 --> 00:23:14.450
<v Voiceover>Yeah, but you know what I'm saying.</v>

553
00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.019
<v ->If you ain't zero, you're still alive.</v>

554
00:23:16.019 --> 00:23:16.726
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

555
00:23:16.726 --> 00:23:17.960
What happened?
<v ->I even have at a scale</v>

556
00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.675
of 100 so people were zeroes, and they were doing fine.

557
00:23:22.165 --> 00:23:23.782
They were zeroes because...

558
00:23:26.203 --> 00:23:31.203
They were between point zero zero and point four.

559
00:23:31.876 --> 00:23:32.940
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

560
00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.994
<v ->Which comes with, so, if I extend that to a scale of 1000.</v>

561
00:23:36.244 --> 00:23:37.304
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

562
00:23:37.304 --> 00:23:38.414
<v ->Okay?</v>

563
00:23:38.414 --> 00:23:41.891
Then I got a little higher number.

564
00:23:42.514 --> 00:23:44.515
<v Voiceover>But what happened in those years</v>

565
00:23:44.515 --> 00:23:47.352
that created such a decimation in the life force?

566
00:23:47.352 --> 00:23:51.206
<v ->What happened is, very simply, everybody in the urban,</v>

567
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:56.544
western world, but by western, I do include,

568
00:23:57.199 --> 00:23:58.824
I forget there's latitude and longitude,

569
00:23:58.824 --> 00:24:03.256
Australia is western, et cetera, has the frequency

570
00:24:03.738 --> 00:24:06.326
of an acquired immune deficiency.

571
00:24:06.805 --> 00:24:08.993
Now, what happens then is very simple.

572
00:24:09.371 --> 00:24:10.912
It's not understood medically, but energetically,

573
00:24:10.912 --> 00:24:12.422
I'll tell you exactly what happens.

574
00:24:13.377 --> 00:24:15.291
We all come here with issues.

575
00:24:16.414 --> 00:24:18.206
Things that are unresolved within us.

576
00:24:18.985 --> 00:24:20.908
Now, you can speak of it physically,

577
00:24:20.908 --> 00:24:22.827
you can call it hereditary diseases.

578
00:24:22.827 --> 00:24:25.199
Cancer, heart disease, diabetes, whatever it may be.

579
00:24:26.525 --> 00:24:30.708
Or you can speak of them in a more metaphysical level.

580
00:24:31.095 --> 00:24:32.908
Karmic issues you need to resolve.

581
00:24:33.534 --> 00:24:35.635
The language choice is yours, it comes down

582
00:24:35.635 --> 00:24:38.340
to the same thing, it doesn't matter.

583
00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.054
We can heal anything, anything whatsoever.

584
00:24:42.413 --> 00:24:45.826
Whether it's acquired or hereditary, and that's known.

585
00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.130
But you're supposed to have your three score years and 10.

586
00:24:49.532 --> 00:24:51.595
When you have an immune deficiency,

587
00:24:52.186 --> 00:24:54.622
within a year or so, the time you acquire

588
00:24:54.622 --> 00:24:58.526
that immune deficiency, the barrier within your body

589
00:24:58.526 --> 00:25:01.890
that keeps these hereditary things at potential

590
00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:04.528
rather than active, keeps them at bay,

591
00:25:04.528 --> 00:25:08.457
the barriers destroy every single thing within you,

592
00:25:08.457 --> 00:25:11.505
whether I can find it or not, doesn't matter about me,

593
00:25:11.505 --> 00:25:14.245
within everyone who has an immune deficiency,

594
00:25:14.245 --> 00:25:16.339
becomes ragingly active.

595
00:25:16.339 --> 00:25:18.538
That's the real story on page one.

596
00:25:18.538 --> 00:25:20.283
Why do you think all these, they're talking about

597
00:25:20.283 --> 00:25:23.606
all these kids now, these young kids with diabetes,

598
00:25:23.606 --> 00:25:26.574
'cause they can have it, so they do.

599
00:25:27.024 --> 00:25:28.458
<v Voiceover>Because the barriers that were protecting</v>

600
00:25:28.458 --> 00:25:29.392
them are no longer present.

601
00:25:29.392 --> 00:25:33.593
<v ->Kept them, kept this at bay until maybe they were 60, 70,</v>

602
00:25:33.593 --> 00:25:35.827
who knows, is gone.

603
00:25:35.827 --> 00:25:38.053
Why do you think all these kids, there's so much

604
00:25:38.053 --> 00:25:40.394
juvenile cancer now, it's the same thing.

605
00:25:40.394 --> 00:25:42.690
'Cause they can, so they do.

606
00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:45.184
That's the story on page one, is why I've gotten

607
00:25:46.054 --> 00:25:49.240
very explicit instructions, you ain't gonna retire.

608
00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.290
<v Voiceover>How did this happen?</v>

609
00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:51.312
<v ->I mean, I'm 70.</v>

610
00:25:51.312 --> 00:25:52.413
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->I've earned it.</v>

611
00:25:52.413 --> 00:25:53.513
<v Voiceover>You've earned it, but.</v>

612
00:25:53.513 --> 00:25:54.339
<v ->But I'm not gonna do it.</v>

613
00:25:54.339 --> 00:25:55.076
<v Voiceover>You're not going anywhere,</v>

614
00:25:55.076 --> 00:25:57.287
you still have a lot of life force left.

615
00:25:57.287 --> 00:25:59.049
How did this happen?

616
00:25:59.049 --> 00:26:00.516
How did everyone in the western world

617
00:26:00.516 --> 00:26:01.687
end up with this signature?

618
00:26:01.687 --> 00:26:05.726
<v ->There are two ways, and I wanna go only so far with this.</v>

619
00:26:05.726 --> 00:26:06.559
<v Voiceover>I understand.</v>

620
00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:10.131
<v ->But one way is the minority way,</v>

621
00:26:10.131 --> 00:26:13.234
and that's two diseases, two disease frequencies

622
00:26:13.234 --> 00:26:14.777
that come from spider bites.

623
00:26:15.929 --> 00:26:17.897
Occasionally mosquitoes, but usually spiders.

624
00:26:17.897 --> 00:26:19.788
<v Voiceover>What's the majority way?</v>

625
00:26:19.788 --> 00:26:21.110
<v ->What's the majority?</v>

626
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:23.804
It's an acquired immune deficiency syndrome

627
00:26:23.804 --> 00:26:27.316
from a man made disease that has been

628
00:26:27.316 --> 00:26:31.039
aerosolized and sprayed, and I mean,

629
00:26:31.039 --> 00:26:34.440
it's supposed to be that, it's called a retrovirus.

630
00:26:35.391 --> 00:26:36.343
Well, what's that mean?

631
00:26:36.343 --> 00:26:38.251
It means it uses reverse transcriptase,

632
00:26:38.251 --> 00:26:40.928
which means that no two people in the world

633
00:26:40.928 --> 00:26:44.316
have the same HIV because they ain't got the same DNA.

634
00:26:44.802 --> 00:26:47.590
A retrovirus combines with your DNA

635
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:52.590
to give you your own specifically personal disease.

636
00:26:54.609 --> 00:26:56.671
And that's how I discovered all this 'cause

637
00:26:56.671 --> 00:26:59.147
I had a lot of people who had immune deficiencies,

638
00:26:59.147 --> 00:27:02.585
I was charting it in my office in Santa Monica

639
00:27:02.585 --> 00:27:04.314
when suddenly, I was looking at the subtle differences

640
00:27:04.314 --> 00:27:06.732
from partner to partner, it was kind of interesting.

641
00:27:08.154 --> 00:27:11.217
And I understood it was man made, it was obvious.

642
00:27:11.217 --> 00:27:12.287
<v Voiceover>Anyone that's listening to this</v>

643
00:27:12.287 --> 00:27:14.858
can go do a little research and figure this part out,

644
00:27:14.858 --> 00:27:16.117
this is available.
<v ->It's recumbent.</v>

645
00:27:16.117 --> 00:27:17.726
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->I've said that in the book.</v>

646
00:27:17.726 --> 00:27:19.022
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->If you have a,</v>

647
00:27:19.022 --> 00:27:22.000
again, if you have a gold fish and a lap dog,

648
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.291
and you go to work, you are secure knowing

649
00:27:24.291 --> 00:27:26.545
that they ain't gonna mate and give you a gold dog

650
00:27:26.545 --> 00:27:28.036
and a lap fish.

651
00:27:28.036 --> 00:27:28.802
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

652
00:27:28.802 --> 00:27:30.761
<v ->But to do that in a laboratory is child's play.</v>

653
00:27:31.114 --> 00:27:32.482
<v Voiceover>Child's play.</v>
<v ->That would be very advanced.</v>

654
00:27:32.482 --> 00:27:33.948
<v Voiceover>And...</v>
<v ->And it's a symptom</v>

655
00:27:33.948 --> 00:27:37.817
of how nuts we have become, and that is the reason

656
00:27:37.817 --> 00:27:39.182
this miracle is offered.

657
00:27:39.182 --> 00:27:42.917
There's a line being drawn, and that line is saying,

658
00:27:42.917 --> 00:27:45.358
those who understand that our only hope

659
00:27:45.358 --> 00:27:49.246
is to elevate our consciousness are on one side,

660
00:27:49.246 --> 00:27:51.402
and those who say, it was good enough

661
00:27:51.402 --> 00:27:53.635
for my father, good enough for my grandfather,

662
00:27:53.635 --> 00:27:55.668
good enough for the Flintstones,

663
00:27:55.668 --> 00:27:56.336
okay?
<v Voiceover>Good enough</v>

664
00:27:56.336 --> 00:27:57.174
for me.

665
00:27:57.174 --> 00:27:58.111
<v ->Right.</v>

666
00:27:58.941 --> 00:28:02.621
A condensate occurs when an old paradigm ceases to function

667
00:28:03.163 --> 00:28:04.761
and a new one arises to take its place.

668
00:28:05.941 --> 00:28:07.800
There are no accidents in the universe.

669
00:28:08.311 --> 00:28:08.983
<v Voiceover>But...</v>

670
00:28:08.983 --> 00:28:12.180
<v ->And we are at that moment of a condensate right now,</v>

671
00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.929
which is a revolution within evolution.

672
00:28:15.083 --> 00:28:16.659
<v Voiceover>Yes, and again, I encourage everyone</v>

673
00:28:16.659 --> 00:28:18.487
listening to this or watching this right now

674
00:28:18.487 --> 00:28:20.124
to also read Between the Lines,

675
00:28:20.124 --> 00:28:21.823
and we're talking about Eric Borne,

676
00:28:21.823 --> 00:28:24.196
but nonetheless, these frequencies are here.

677
00:28:24.196 --> 00:28:29.196
We, in the western world, have virtually all been exposed,

678
00:28:29.701 --> 00:28:30.900
and have this within us.
<v ->In the urban western world.</v>

679
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.303
<v Voiceover>In the urban western world.</v>

680
00:28:32.303 --> 00:28:33.401
Okay.
<v ->Yes.</v>

681
00:28:33.401 --> 00:28:34.475
<v Voiceover>All right, so, now...</v>

682
00:28:34.475 --> 00:28:35.942
<v ->Maybe that means if you live,</v>

683
00:28:35.942 --> 00:28:39.143
if you spent your entire life in the hills of Montana

684
00:28:39.143 --> 00:28:41.811
without leaving, you're probably okay.

685
00:28:41.811 --> 00:28:42.545
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

686
00:28:42.545 --> 00:28:43.482
<v ->But who does that?</v>

687
00:28:43.482 --> 00:28:44.806
<v Voiceover>Right, most of the people,</v>

688
00:28:44.806 --> 00:28:47.379
most of us here, that would not be the case.

689
00:28:47.379 --> 00:28:49.155
<v ->That's why I told you, dogs, cats, horses,</v>

690
00:28:49.155 --> 00:28:52.261
their average life force is still between 95 and 99.

691
00:28:52.261 --> 00:28:54.163
<v Voiceover>Yeah, yeah, and look what's happening.</v>

692
00:28:54.163 --> 00:28:56.660
<v ->'Cause the H stands for human.</v>

693
00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:57.911
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

694
00:28:58.268 --> 00:28:59.607
<v ->Right.</v>

695
00:28:59.607 --> 00:29:01.264
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

696
00:29:01.264 --> 00:29:05.341
Okay, so we have this, now, what is the implication of this?

697
00:29:05.341 --> 00:29:08.071
You already explained that we, our natural barriers

698
00:29:08.071 --> 00:29:10.714
and defenses have been broken down as a result of this,

699
00:29:10.714 --> 00:29:13.311
so now, let's look at what happens if you try to apply

700
00:29:13.311 --> 00:29:16.014
the frequency, when you apply the frequencies

701
00:29:16.014 --> 00:29:17.617
after barriers have been broken down,

702
00:29:17.617 --> 00:29:20.612
and this thing is in the body, what are the manifestations

703
00:29:20.612 --> 00:29:23.087
in terms of detoxification and so forth

704
00:29:23.087 --> 00:29:24.326
when someone goes on...
<v ->There are no manifestations</v>

705
00:29:24.326 --> 00:29:27.165
for detoxification of acquired things,

706
00:29:27.165 --> 00:29:29.371
or maybe you have a lousy night.

707
00:29:29.371 --> 00:29:31.662
<v Voiceover>That's it, okay, so, talk about that.</v>

708
00:29:31.662 --> 00:29:32.800
<v Voiceover>Take about a week to 10 days,</v>

709
00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.076
and they're gone.

710
00:29:34.595 --> 00:29:36.869
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>
<v ->To reach a crisis</v>

711
00:29:36.869 --> 00:29:39.616
within that, perhaps, one night, and then that's it.

712
00:29:40.076 --> 00:29:42.365
It's everything about us that matters,

713
00:29:42.365 --> 00:29:46.517
is what which acquired imbalance we're talking about

714
00:29:46.517 --> 00:29:49.566
sets loose, and that is, what is hereditary within you?

715
00:29:49.566 --> 00:29:52.081
<v Voiceover>So, let's take some concrete examples,</v>

716
00:29:52.081 --> 00:29:53.598
kinda like what you did in your book.

717
00:29:53.598 --> 00:29:55.558
Let's take a couple concrete examples of people

718
00:29:55.558 --> 00:29:57.389
who now, these barriers are out of the way,

719
00:29:57.389 --> 00:29:59.956
now you gotta deal with the hereditary stuff bubbling up.

720
00:29:59.956 --> 00:30:01.696
What's that like?

721
00:30:01.696 --> 00:30:04.465
<v ->That is absolutely unpredictable</v>

722
00:30:04.465 --> 00:30:07.672
because your only question is, what's it like for you?

723
00:30:07.672 --> 00:30:08.498
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

724
00:30:08.498 --> 00:30:10.334
<v ->When you get to the deepest levels,</v>

725
00:30:10.334 --> 00:30:12.335
it's not going to be all that easy

726
00:30:12.335 --> 00:30:16.208
for a very simple and obvious reason.

727
00:30:16.208 --> 00:30:19.105
These things that are hereditary are there

728
00:30:19.105 --> 00:30:23.039
because they are part of something you could

729
00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:27.346
not face, whatever it was.

730
00:30:27.346 --> 00:30:29.621
Remember my story about, with Michael Beckwith's kid,

731
00:30:31.041 --> 00:30:33.773
he was six years old, and he had hereditary inactive cancer?

732
00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.423
And that's when Michael called me linear,

733
00:30:36.496 --> 00:30:37.496
and on, and on.

734
00:30:37.496 --> 00:30:40.695
The point is, what created that cancer?

735
00:30:40.695 --> 00:30:45.546
Unresolved, unconscious, previously existent bitterness

736
00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.699
somewhere in that person, it was deep within

737
00:30:48.699 --> 00:30:51.069
the abyss and the center of that person

738
00:30:51.069 --> 00:30:54.049
was something unresolved that he couldn't face,

739
00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:56.060
and couldn't allow anyone else to see.

740
00:30:56.611 --> 00:30:57.713
So, that's a two step process.

741
00:30:57.713 --> 00:30:59.418
First, you make sure nobody can see it,

742
00:30:59.418 --> 00:31:00.942
then you make sure you take it one step further,

743
00:31:00.942 --> 00:31:02.339
you can't see it.

744
00:31:02.339 --> 00:31:04.095
Now you really got it together.

745
00:31:04.095 --> 00:31:05.355
Except for one thing, it's still there.

746
00:31:05.355 --> 00:31:06.090
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

747
00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:10.049
<v ->And so, it will manifest in a different form.</v>

748
00:31:10.695 --> 00:31:12.426
Which is cancer.

749
00:31:12.426 --> 00:31:13.532
Et cetera.

750
00:31:13.532 --> 00:31:18.524
So, it's the old story, 50 people kiss the hostess,

751
00:31:19.241 --> 00:31:20.726
merry Christmas, under the mistletoe.

752
00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:24.169
49 are fine, the 50th one wakes up in the morning,

753
00:31:24.169 --> 00:31:25.454
there's a little tingling in his lip,

754
00:31:25.968 --> 00:31:26.837
and there's some herpes.

755
00:31:26.837 --> 00:31:27.804
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

756
00:31:27.804 --> 00:31:30.914
<v ->That's a commentary on a weakness</v>

757
00:31:30.914 --> 00:31:33.268
that he brought with him in his lip.

758
00:31:34.155 --> 00:31:36.292
Everybody catches everything.

759
00:31:36.292 --> 00:31:37.187
Everything.

760
00:31:37.187 --> 00:31:40.861
Especially in this day and age where there's no possible

761
00:31:40.861 --> 00:31:42.373
geographic immunity.

762
00:31:43.632 --> 00:31:46.503
Everybody goes everywhere, comes back with everything,

763
00:31:46.503 --> 00:31:47.814
et cetera.

764
00:31:48.469 --> 00:31:51.089
Everything is everywhere now, everybody catches everything.

765
00:31:52.072 --> 00:31:55.510
Everybody heals everything unless it impacts you

766
00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:59.170
where you are so profoundly weakened,

767
00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:02.317
and that's always hereditary, that you cannot do it.

768
00:32:02.317 --> 00:32:06.050
And that's just a restatement of, medical doctors say,

769
00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:07.905
you know, if you don't get a flu shot, it's okay

770
00:32:07.905 --> 00:32:10.885
unless you're immuno compromised,

771
00:32:10.885 --> 00:32:13.728
unless you're elderly, unless you're this or that,

772
00:32:13.728 --> 00:32:14.854
or, you know what I mean?

773
00:32:14.854 --> 00:32:17.907
Otherwise, so, have your flu and don't bother me.

774
00:32:18.767 --> 00:32:20.168
Well, that's the way it is.

775
00:32:20.168 --> 00:32:22.422
I mean, you remember SARS?

776
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:23.996
You remember that story?

777
00:32:23.996 --> 00:32:25.096
Well, somewhere, SARS was somewhere

778
00:32:25.096 --> 00:32:28.171
between anthrax and the prairie dog invasion.

779
00:32:28.171 --> 00:32:28.808
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

780
00:32:28.808 --> 00:32:29.313
<v ->Okay?</v>

781
00:32:29.313 --> 00:32:30.177
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

782
00:32:30.177 --> 00:32:32.979
<v ->And during that, I was in Toronto speaking</v>

783
00:32:32.979 --> 00:32:35.035
in front of 1500 people.

784
00:32:35.035 --> 00:32:37.346
And I was doing a mini evaluation

785
00:32:37.346 --> 00:32:40.092
with someone's thumb, and I said, look at this,

786
00:32:40.092 --> 00:32:41.932
this is the frequency of SARS.

787
00:32:44.227 --> 00:32:46.203
Without communicating what I knew about it.

788
00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:50.009
I had, I went from 1500 people to like, nobody but me.

789
00:32:50.697 --> 00:32:54.319
Even the person whose thumb I had left in minutes.

790
00:32:54.926 --> 00:32:56.501
I have a flare for PR, you can...

791
00:32:56.501 --> 00:32:58.074
<v Voiceover>Yeah, you know how to clear a room,</v>

792
00:32:58.074 --> 00:32:59.294
that's what it sounds like.

793
00:32:59.294 --> 00:33:00.726
<v ->I can fill it but I can clear it.</v>

794
00:33:00.726 --> 00:33:02.455
<v Voiceover>Well, but, it was a problem in Canada.</v>

795
00:33:02.455 --> 00:33:04.967
Theoretically, by the news.

796
00:33:04.967 --> 00:33:06.133
<v ->The problem is this.</v>

797
00:33:06.711 --> 00:33:07.947
For a long time, people were saying,

798
00:33:07.947 --> 00:33:09.035
do you have SARS in the computer?

799
00:33:09.035 --> 00:33:11.165
<v ->I said, I don't know, I've never seen a picture of it.</v>

800
00:33:11.748 --> 00:33:12.922
There are no slides, nothing.

801
00:33:12.922 --> 00:33:15.284
Finally, but meanwhile, during that period

802
00:33:15.284 --> 00:33:18.189
at grown New York, I facilitated advice.

803
00:33:18.189 --> 00:33:19.792
Called to see, if I get this thing in my lungs,

804
00:33:19.792 --> 00:33:22.495
and they say, oh, I'm not shaking it so well.

805
00:33:22.495 --> 00:33:23.991
I think there's something not in the database,

806
00:33:23.991 --> 00:33:24.895
would you look?

807
00:33:24.895 --> 00:33:25.829
And she was right.

808
00:33:25.829 --> 00:33:28.371
And so, I put it in the AIM program,

809
00:33:28.371 --> 00:33:30.289
named it after her, fine.

810
00:33:32.104 --> 00:33:33.534
And then I was asked once, I don't know,

811
00:33:33.534 --> 00:33:37.064
one day, Reuters published an electron microscopy picture

812
00:33:37.064 --> 00:33:38.419
of SARS.

813
00:33:39.076 --> 00:33:39.916
I went, gotcha.

814
00:33:39.916 --> 00:33:42.068
I looked, I went, oh, it's you.

815
00:33:43.349 --> 00:33:44.416
I had it.

816
00:33:44.416 --> 00:33:47.489
And I was looking at people who were transitioning

817
00:33:47.489 --> 00:33:52.013
from SARS, and I saw they had this disease frequency.

818
00:33:52.013 --> 00:33:52.983
Sure.

819
00:33:52.983 --> 00:33:56.881
Underneath it, they had incredibly advanced lung cancer,

820
00:33:57.353 --> 00:34:01.817
or this, or that, which meant that they couldn't heal it.

821
00:34:02.325 --> 00:34:04.790
Other than that, you get everything, you heal everything.

822
00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:05.969
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

823
00:34:05.969 --> 00:34:08.899
<v ->So, that means all that matters is</v>

824
00:34:08.899 --> 00:34:11.975
that you not have the vulnerability.

825
00:34:11.975 --> 00:34:13.676
And that is hereditary.

826
00:34:13.676 --> 00:34:14.981
And you can heal everything.

827
00:34:14.981 --> 00:34:16.078
Well, you get to the deepest layers,

828
00:34:16.078 --> 00:34:18.055
to get back to the beginning of your question

829
00:34:18.055 --> 00:34:21.629
if I did follow that fret of argument,

830
00:34:22.578 --> 00:34:24.159
at the deepest layers, you're dealing with

831
00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:27.468
what you chose not to face.

832
00:34:28.031 --> 00:34:30.524
And so, you will deal with it,

833
00:34:30.524 --> 00:34:33.265
but you deal with it with some intrepidation,

834
00:34:33.265 --> 00:34:36.267
you know, because you chose it for a reason.

835
00:34:36.267 --> 00:34:37.888
Not a rational reason.

836
00:34:38.541 --> 00:34:39.571
<v Voiceover>Let's say you had the signature</v>

837
00:34:39.571 --> 00:34:42.210
of hereditary diabetes, and you were going through

838
00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:45.745
AIM now, and it starts, cleared off the more superficial

839
00:34:45.745 --> 00:34:50.345
levels of the acquired types of signatures, let's say,

840
00:34:50.345 --> 00:34:52.153
and now you're down to the big ones,

841
00:34:52.153 --> 00:34:53.352
the hereditary stuff.

842
00:34:53.352 --> 00:34:54.444
What happens?

843
00:34:54.444 --> 00:34:55.723
I know you said everybody is different,

844
00:34:55.723 --> 00:34:58.112
but let's give an example of maybe someone

845
00:34:58.112 --> 00:35:01.103
that you've seen with diabetes, for example.

846
00:35:01.103 --> 00:35:01.891
<v ->Sure.</v>

847
00:35:01.891 --> 00:35:02.651
<v Voiceover>How easy can it be</v>

848
00:35:02.651 --> 00:35:04.075
and how difficult can it be?

849
00:35:06.801 --> 00:35:08.768
<v ->It depends upon so many things.</v>

850
00:35:08.768 --> 00:35:13.768
For example, a woman who has the hereditary type of TB.

851
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:16.368
There are three things that I've found to create

852
00:35:16.368 --> 00:35:17.942
hereditary diabetes.

853
00:35:17.942 --> 00:35:22.208
One of them creates both type one and type two,

854
00:35:22.208 --> 00:35:23.852
another one creates just type one,

855
00:35:23.852 --> 00:35:24.976
another one just creates type two.

856
00:35:24.976 --> 00:35:26.801
Energetically, those frequencies.

857
00:35:28.346 --> 00:35:31.625
A woman, usually typically, will deal with the emotions

858
00:35:31.625 --> 00:35:33.230
readily and easily.

859
00:35:34.794 --> 00:35:37.303
Men don't like emotion a hell of a lot.

860
00:35:38.533 --> 00:35:40.763
And so, they'll turn it into more physical

861
00:35:40.763 --> 00:35:45.397
and go, it's craving this, that, whereas women can,

862
00:35:45.397 --> 00:35:48.259
women are, have a little easier time with it.

863
00:35:48.259 --> 00:35:50.629
It's the emotion that stops us guys.

864
00:35:51.039 --> 00:35:52.626
Okay?

865
00:35:53.781 --> 00:35:56.353
But whatever it is, it's going to be filled,

866
00:35:56.353 --> 00:35:57.473
just like...

867
00:35:57.473 --> 00:35:58.746
<v Voiceover>But how would that express itself?</v>

868
00:35:58.746 --> 00:36:01.151
How would diabetes, anyone you've seen with this,

869
00:36:01.151 --> 00:36:02.321
how does it feel in the body?
<v ->There are three</v>

870
00:36:02.321 --> 00:36:03.759
different frequencies that cause it,

871
00:36:03.759 --> 00:36:06.691
each one is caused, energetically,

872
00:36:06.691 --> 00:36:08.890
by a different emotion.

873
00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:09.527
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

874
00:36:09.527 --> 00:36:10.640
<v ->Okay?</v>

875
00:36:11.322 --> 00:36:13.833
Take something less variable.

876
00:36:13.833 --> 00:36:17.455
I told you about bitterness and cancer.

877
00:36:18.138 --> 00:36:22.353
And rheumatoid arthritis is always

878
00:36:22.838 --> 00:36:25.692
some kind of deep inflexibility.

879
00:36:27.408 --> 00:36:29.979
There is something that I had done recently

880
00:36:29.979 --> 00:36:32.382
that I call the cancer biopathy.

881
00:36:32.382 --> 00:36:34.351
I've always suspected that because of my

882
00:36:34.351 --> 00:36:36.469
studies of Vill-En-Home Rike and his work.

883
00:36:37.423 --> 00:36:39.938
And I was, energetically, it's true.

884
00:36:40.525 --> 00:36:42.926
There are three things, hereditarily,

885
00:36:42.926 --> 00:36:44.674
that allow cancer to flourish.

886
00:36:45.831 --> 00:36:48.172
I've figured out the three of them,

887
00:36:48.172 --> 00:36:49.573
and they have the exact same percentage

888
00:36:49.573 --> 00:36:52.554
of the population as the percentage of cancer,

889
00:36:53.098 --> 00:36:54.299
which is interesting.

890
00:36:54.299 --> 00:36:59.299
They are characterized primarily by anxiety with.

891
00:37:00.481 --> 00:37:03.382
Some have anxiety with headaches, some have anxiety

892
00:37:03.382 --> 00:37:07.569
with muscular tension, some have anxiety with hostility.

893
00:37:08.517 --> 00:37:09.591
Okay?

894
00:37:09.591 --> 00:37:13.919
It's anxiety with the side dishes of your choice,

895
00:37:13.919 --> 00:37:15.308
if you will.

896
00:37:16.665 --> 00:37:19.164
And they're all gone, and everyone is no named now.

897
00:37:19.164 --> 00:37:20.444
They're gone.

898
00:37:20.804 --> 00:37:23.734
<v Voiceover>So, anxiety is, with its accompanied</v>

899
00:37:23.734 --> 00:37:26.301
side dish, bitterness.
<v ->Now,</v>

900
00:37:26.301 --> 00:37:29.542
the anxiety with cephalgia, headaches, okay?

901
00:37:29.542 --> 00:37:34.332
Some people detox it, having crushing headaches.

902
00:37:34.982 --> 00:37:35.812
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

903
00:37:35.812 --> 00:37:37.498
<v ->Migraines, cluster, whatever.</v>

904
00:37:37.983 --> 00:37:41.253
Others just have the anxiety and pass on the headache,

905
00:37:41.253 --> 00:37:42.473
they can deal with the emotion

906
00:37:43.785 --> 00:37:46.235
more readily than the pain.

907
00:37:46.859 --> 00:37:49.244
It's absolutely your choice.

908
00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.706
And the rate of detoxing is your choice.

909
00:37:52.698 --> 00:37:56.246
But you will 'cause you are made to heal yourself.

910
00:37:57.055 --> 00:37:59.470
That's the volitional aspect of AIM.

911
00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:01.608
There is an, not the involutional,

912
00:38:01.608 --> 00:38:05.339
it's inevitable, we are made to heal ourselves,

913
00:38:05.339 --> 00:38:07.441
it's an instinct, okay?

914
00:38:07.441 --> 00:38:11.191
No matter what you say, you strive to heal yourself.

915
00:38:11.622 --> 00:38:14.290
There is a part of the AIM program that I think

916
00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:17.976
overly is the most important part that is voluntary,

917
00:38:18.549 --> 00:38:22.060
and that has to do with that abyss,

918
00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:26.518
as I say, in the center of yourself, that you can't fill.

919
00:38:26.518 --> 00:38:28.269
It's your vulnerability.

920
00:38:28.269 --> 00:38:32.544
And unless you heal that, new things will come up

921
00:38:33.139 --> 00:38:36.587
because that's really healing your soul.

922
00:38:37.566 --> 00:38:38.989
And how do you heal your soul?

923
00:38:39.814 --> 00:38:41.217
It's an act of courage.

924
00:38:41.217 --> 00:38:43.765
You invite the entire world in.

925
00:38:44.483 --> 00:38:45.935
They fill you.

926
00:38:46.422 --> 00:38:49.306
And that is simply just a variation of the hologram.

927
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:50.424
You see what I mean?

928
00:38:50.424 --> 00:38:51.187
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

929
00:38:51.187 --> 00:38:54.342
<v ->It's, and that is being in the oneness, truly.</v>

930
00:38:55.089 --> 00:38:56.362
Once you perceive it, and feel it,

931
00:38:56.362 --> 00:38:59.156
and live that way, if it's you, they're gonna have

932
00:38:59.156 --> 00:39:02.185
a lot of churches named the first church of Regina

933
00:39:02.872 --> 00:39:05.880
because people will perceive that about you.

934
00:39:06.366 --> 00:39:09.929
Anyone who lives in that oneness is perceived as such.

935
00:39:10.441 --> 00:39:13.311
And I know, I'm a working process, you know?

936
00:39:13.311 --> 00:39:15.301
<v Voiceover>As we all are.</v>

937
00:39:16.018 --> 00:39:17.350
<v ->What happens when you, okay,</v>

938
00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:19.250
so you've dealt with this, you've detoxed,

939
00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:21.124
you've gotten rid of the hereditary factors

940
00:39:21.124 --> 00:39:24.384
that energetic imprint in your being,

941
00:39:24.384 --> 00:39:27.723
and now, you're, what does that do to the life force,

942
00:39:27.723 --> 00:39:28.661
first of all?

943
00:39:28.661 --> 00:39:31.528
Can you expect to see a bump up in the life force?

944
00:39:31.528 --> 00:39:34.417
<v ->Oh yeah, your life force is only one acceptable number.</v>

945
00:39:34.767 --> 00:39:35.802
That's 100.
<v Voiceover>100%.</v>

946
00:39:35.802 --> 00:39:37.564
<v ->Right, whether you're a one or a seven,</v>

947
00:39:37.564 --> 00:39:39.298
within a year's time, you will certainly be

948
00:39:39.298 --> 00:39:40.734
a life force of 100.

949
00:39:40.734 --> 00:39:41.342
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

950
00:39:41.342 --> 00:39:42.575
<v ->nothing else is acceptable.</v>

951
00:39:42.575 --> 00:39:47.080
But what I also can measure, consciousness,

952
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.048
I'll use data hawking scale, usually,

953
00:39:49.048 --> 00:39:50.134
I think it's very inspiring.

954
00:39:50.134 --> 00:39:51.120
<v Voiceover>It is.</v>
<v ->And I've found it</v>

955
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.416
to be very valuable.

956
00:39:52.416 --> 00:39:54.319
So, why reinvent something?

957
00:39:54.319 --> 00:39:56.154
There's no point.

958
00:39:57.190 --> 00:40:00.406
Your consciousness, if you choose

959
00:40:00.953 --> 00:40:04.068
these frequencies such as, you know,

960
00:40:04.068 --> 00:40:05.919
Michael suggests, Michael Beckwith suggested

961
00:40:05.919 --> 00:40:09.340
the frequency of what agape is, unconditional love.

962
00:40:09.997 --> 00:40:11.716
And perpetual gratitude.

963
00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:15.345
And replace fear with courage, and on, and on,

964
00:40:15.345 --> 00:40:18.639
and allow every moment to empower you,

965
00:40:18.639 --> 00:40:21.881
allow every person to empower you, and on, and on.

966
00:40:21.881 --> 00:40:24.177
If you select these, your conscious level goes up,

967
00:40:24.177 --> 00:40:26.354
and up, and up, and up, and up.

968
00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.057
Interesting enough, if you're a man,

969
00:40:28.057 --> 00:40:29.200
you still compete.

970
00:40:29.789 --> 00:40:30.484
(mumbling)

971
00:40:30.484 --> 00:40:31.489
Michael and I compete all the time.

972
00:40:31.489 --> 00:40:32.519
<v Voiceover>That's hard wired, eh?</v>

973
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:34.888
<v ->Michael and I compete all the time.</v>

974
00:40:34.888 --> 00:40:37.640
And we're never farther than one point away from each other

975
00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:38.977
in consciousness.

976
00:40:39.337 --> 00:40:41.600
<v Voiceover>That's interesting, and that gets really</v>

977
00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.832
kind of back to the beginning, which is,

978
00:40:43.832 --> 00:40:46.373
our bodies are spending, our beings,

979
00:40:46.373 --> 00:40:49.212
they're spending so much time in survival mode

980
00:40:49.212 --> 00:40:50.977
with the onslaught of this new thing,

981
00:40:50.977 --> 00:40:53.282
this acquired immune problem, in addition

982
00:40:53.282 --> 00:40:55.481
to everything else that there's no energy left

983
00:40:55.481 --> 00:40:57.044
in terms of expansion of consciousness.

984
00:40:57.044 --> 00:41:00.005
<v ->Everybody says, I'd like to resonate at the higher</v>

985
00:41:00.005 --> 00:41:01.598
etheric levels.

986
00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:05.527
And that's very well said, and it's exemplary,

987
00:41:05.527 --> 00:41:08.288
except it's analogous to saying,

988
00:41:08.288 --> 00:41:10.645
I would like to build my house from the roof down.

989
00:41:10.924 --> 00:41:12.018
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

990
00:41:12.767 --> 00:41:14.158
<v ->It's just not gonna happen.</v>

991
00:41:14.158 --> 00:41:14.967
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

992
00:41:14.967 --> 00:41:18.537
<v ->You've got to deal with these base,</v>

993
00:41:18.537 --> 00:41:21.800
fundamental foundational levels first.

994
00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.951
You gotta survive.

995
00:41:24.407 --> 00:41:25.641
First thing's first.

996
00:41:25.641 --> 00:41:26.571
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

997
00:41:26.571 --> 00:41:28.583
So, when we come to, first of all,

998
00:41:28.583 --> 00:41:30.317
you're working on all of these people,

999
00:41:30.317 --> 00:41:33.936
now tens of thousands of people simultaneously.

1000
00:41:33.936 --> 00:41:35.354
Another area I was wondering about

1001
00:41:35.354 --> 00:41:37.901
is if a person is already familiar with bio resonances,

1002
00:41:37.901 --> 00:41:40.190
and maybe is working with a type of bio resonance

1003
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:44.121
frequency device or whatnot, does that have any impact

1004
00:41:44.121 --> 00:41:46.964
on this, or are they working wholly separately?

1005
00:41:46.964 --> 00:41:48.631
<v ->No, it has no impact whatsoever in any way.</v>

1006
00:41:48.631 --> 00:41:49.391
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

1007
00:41:49.391 --> 00:41:51.843
<v ->Now, there are exceptions.</v>

1008
00:41:53.968 --> 00:41:57.727
I have found several people who use crystal

1009
00:41:58.813 --> 00:42:01.412
and crystal tinctures in healing.

1010
00:42:01.412 --> 00:42:05.963
If you're going to a crystal healer who's good,

1011
00:42:05.963 --> 00:42:08.611
it's an art form as is acupuncture,

1012
00:42:08.611 --> 00:42:11.559
as is homeopathy, et cetera, okay?

1013
00:42:11.559 --> 00:42:13.946
Just the degree doesn't do it.

1014
00:42:14.358 --> 00:42:17.132
I've found some people accelerate their healing dramatically

1015
00:42:17.132 --> 00:42:18.381
'cause of these crystals.

1016
00:42:20.428 --> 00:42:25.088
The homeopathy, that was the paradigm I copied for this.

1017
00:42:25.902 --> 00:42:27.273
As I said, it's, you know, one of my degrees.

1018
00:42:27.273 --> 00:42:28.034
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1019
00:42:28.034 --> 00:42:32.027
<v ->But, it doesn't interfere,</v>

1020
00:42:32.748 --> 00:42:34.725
but it doesn't help it that much.

1021
00:42:36.379 --> 00:42:41.044
Because every frequency in homeopathics

1022
00:42:41.044 --> 00:42:44.975
are akin to energetics that way, they are energetics.

1023
00:42:45.446 --> 00:42:47.541
Every frequency you need, you're selecting.

1024
00:42:48.125 --> 00:42:49.032
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1025
00:42:49.032 --> 00:42:50.262
<v ->And ignoring the others, the entire material</v>

1026
00:42:50.262 --> 00:42:52.790
medicators are on, et cetera, et cetera.

1027
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:53.496
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1028
00:42:53.496 --> 00:42:54.194
<v ->You'll select what you need.</v>

1029
00:42:54.194 --> 00:42:55.429
<v Voiceover>So, like you say, about a half a million</v>

1030
00:42:55.429 --> 00:42:58.038
plus frequencies, and the list growing by the day

1031
00:42:58.038 --> 00:43:00.938
because there are new things being introduced into...

1032
00:43:00.938 --> 00:43:03.433
<v ->I had us get up at four this morning</v>

1033
00:43:03.433 --> 00:43:04.833
'cause I had to do my checking

1034
00:43:04.833 --> 00:43:07.524
for new imbalances in the world, they're all man made.

1035
00:43:08.783 --> 00:43:11.776
<v Voiceover>That's not good.</v>
<v ->And I had to do it.</v>

1036
00:43:11.776 --> 00:43:14.171
No, that's my weather report, look at the website,

1037
00:43:14.171 --> 00:43:15.157
you'll see it.

1038
00:43:15.157 --> 00:43:16.467
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

1039
00:43:17.363 --> 00:43:19.792
So, a person, say they're listening,

1040
00:43:19.792 --> 00:43:21.491
and they're saying, you know what?

1041
00:43:21.491 --> 00:43:23.289
I think I need to check in to this.

1042
00:43:23.289 --> 00:43:24.809
So, they check in with you, they check in

1043
00:43:24.809 --> 00:43:28.091
with your organization, how long does this go on?

1044
00:43:28.091 --> 00:43:30.337
How long does it take for most people to clear

1045
00:43:30.337 --> 00:43:34.111
the whole array of imbalances, and then how long

1046
00:43:34.111 --> 00:43:37.313
does that continue once the primary things are cleared?

1047
00:43:37.313 --> 00:43:38.905
Do you come back every now and then for a tune up?

1048
00:43:38.905 --> 00:43:40.133
<v ->My primary...</v>

1049
00:43:41.282 --> 00:43:42.007
<v Voiceover>I mean, getting down through</v>

1050
00:43:42.007 --> 00:43:44.940
the hereditary stuff, that main detox stuff.

1051
00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:47.752
<v ->By primary, well, that's all done within a year.</v>

1052
00:43:47.752 --> 00:43:48.855
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

1053
00:43:48.855 --> 00:43:51.027
<v ->That's all done within a year.</v>

1054
00:43:51.523 --> 00:43:54.597
But, look, I'll never get off the AIM program.

1055
00:43:54.597 --> 00:43:56.730
Wayne Dyer will never get off.

1056
00:43:56.730 --> 00:43:58.622
Michael Beckwith won't get off, et cetera, et cetera,

1057
00:43:58.622 --> 00:44:03.622
because that's when you begin to expand your consciousness

1058
00:44:05.061 --> 00:44:06.480
more, and more, and more.

1059
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:11.644
But as far as in a year's time, if you decided

1060
00:44:11.644 --> 00:44:16.253
to have a kid, you would not have anything

1061
00:44:16.253 --> 00:44:19.149
to pass on to that child, it's that simple.

1062
00:44:19.149 --> 00:44:22.355
No cancer, no diabetes, no heart disease, no nothing.

1063
00:44:22.355 --> 00:44:24.318
<v Voiceover>Those of your signature frequencies are gone.</v>

1064
00:44:26.289 --> 00:44:27.586
<v ->As simple as gone means.</v>

1065
00:44:27.586 --> 00:44:30.093
Even if you're a born again Christian, they're gone,

1066
00:44:30.093 --> 00:44:31.526
you will not get them back.

1067
00:44:31.526 --> 00:44:34.364
<v Voiceover>So, belief systems do not interfere with this</v>

1068
00:44:34.364 --> 00:44:37.766
on any level in terms of like you just say?

1069
00:44:37.766 --> 00:44:39.208
<v ->I don't know how you define interfere.</v>

1070
00:44:39.208 --> 00:44:40.253
I mean...

1071
00:44:40.942 --> 00:44:41.939
<v Voiceover>A frequency is a frequency.</v>

1072
00:44:41.939 --> 00:44:43.706
<v ->Consciousness is a degree to me.</v>

1073
00:44:43.706 --> 00:44:46.841
It's the degree to which you perceive your interaction

1074
00:44:46.841 --> 00:44:50.222
with everything and everyone in the universe.

1075
00:44:50.614 --> 00:44:52.144
When I get harassed and harried,

1076
00:44:52.144 --> 00:44:54.655
and have everybody in the MC square saying,

1077
00:44:54.655 --> 00:44:57.059
Steph, Steph, Steph, Steph, Steph,

1078
00:44:57.059 --> 00:45:00.394
and you know, and it happens, I stop and go,

1079
00:45:00.394 --> 00:45:04.875
I'm losing my consciousness, and it's literally the case.

1080
00:45:05.822 --> 00:45:09.131
And I'll say, all right, I need to take a break,

1081
00:45:09.131 --> 00:45:10.882
and no one bothers me then.

1082
00:45:11.408 --> 00:45:15.375
I'll just lie down on the floor and focus on everything

1083
00:45:15.375 --> 00:45:16.994
and how I am part of it.

1084
00:45:17.867 --> 00:45:20.675
And that's my meditation, take about 15 minutes,

1085
00:45:20.675 --> 00:45:22.891
and then I can focus again.

1086
00:45:23.372 --> 00:45:25.825
I think meditation is very important in life.

1087
00:45:26.623 --> 00:45:28.319
I don't know how I would get through life

1088
00:45:28.319 --> 00:45:31.145
with some of the crazy people I deal with,

1089
00:45:31.145 --> 00:45:34.147
without being able to take that break and say, okay.

1090
00:45:35.595 --> 00:45:39.512
I'm part of you, but I'm part of everyone else also,

1091
00:45:39.512 --> 00:45:40.458
so shut up.

1092
00:45:40.458 --> 00:45:41.584
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1093
00:45:43.235 --> 00:45:45.169
And you deal with everything, one of the program's

1094
00:45:45.169 --> 00:45:47.201
you've been doing is, you've been dealing with

1095
00:45:47.201 --> 00:45:49.138
autistic individuals, children?

1096
00:45:49.138 --> 00:45:51.540
<v ->There's a program, yeah, and that came about</v>

1097
00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:55.438
because people like Wayne Dyer and many others,

1098
00:45:56.108 --> 00:46:00.240
who I feel have contributed to our culture, spiritually,

1099
00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.657
and if they were all on AIM, I told them, look,

1100
00:46:02.657 --> 00:46:06.226
meet someone who needs this, and you know,

1101
00:46:06.226 --> 00:46:08.597
if they can't afford it, comp 'em,

1102
00:46:08.597 --> 00:46:11.157
you can give 'em a scholarship, kay?

1103
00:46:11.157 --> 00:46:14.331
No reservation, no limitation, whatever it is.

1104
00:46:14.331 --> 00:46:15.024
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1105
00:46:15.024 --> 00:46:16.272
<v ->Just so they know what it is so I can have them</v>

1106
00:46:16.272 --> 00:46:18.521
do some research, I can.

1107
00:46:18.956 --> 00:46:22.189
Well, one such person was a little girl who had autism.

1108
00:46:22.666 --> 00:46:27.650
And I looked, and I found two hereditary imbalances in her

1109
00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:31.021
that contributed to her autism, put them on the AIM program,

1110
00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:34.750
named them after her, and forgot about it,

1111
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:38.121
it wasn't in my consciousness until about six months later,

1112
00:46:38.121 --> 00:46:40.462
her parents called and said, by the way, you know,

1113
00:46:40.462 --> 00:46:42.456
our child is no longer autistic.

1114
00:46:42.456 --> 00:46:43.999
I said, great.

1115
00:46:43.999 --> 00:46:45.497
And I didn't think anymore about it.

1116
00:46:45.497 --> 00:46:47.235
Then the phones began to ring.

1117
00:46:47.235 --> 00:46:48.667
It turned out there were hundreds and hundreds

1118
00:46:48.667 --> 00:46:51.105
of kids in the AIM program who were autistic.

1119
00:46:51.105 --> 00:46:51.901
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

1120
00:46:51.901 --> 00:46:54.598
<v ->I don't check it when I do an initial evaluation.</v>

1121
00:46:54.598 --> 00:46:56.304
I check to see if you're alive.

1122
00:46:56.304 --> 00:46:58.203
<v Voiceover>Right, and you're above zero.</v>

1123
00:46:58.203 --> 00:46:59.047
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1124
00:46:59.047 --> 00:47:00.199
And...

1125
00:47:01.746 --> 00:47:04.015
And they were all calling in, saying,

1126
00:47:04.015 --> 00:47:05.665
my child's not autistic anymore.

1127
00:47:06.817 --> 00:47:09.450
And I've told youth, culminating when I was speaking

1128
00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:12.383
in Melbourne, Australia, and I was,

1129
00:47:13.273 --> 00:47:15.795
when I speak usually, I try to spend as much time as I can

1130
00:47:15.795 --> 00:47:18.492
doing what I'm doing with you, question and answer,

1131
00:47:18.492 --> 00:47:19.600
what do you wanna know?

1132
00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.552
If I can, I'll go answer it, you know?

1133
00:47:23.235 --> 00:47:25.202
And in the middle of that, a little girl walked up to me

1134
00:47:25.202 --> 00:47:27.248
and said, can I thank you?

1135
00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:30.881
Sure, anyone can thank me.

1136
00:47:32.641 --> 00:47:34.452
I like being thanked, but for what?

1137
00:47:35.139 --> 00:47:36.781
Well, I couldn't have thanked you last year,

1138
00:47:36.781 --> 00:47:38.167
I was autistic, now I'm not.

1139
00:47:40.255 --> 00:47:41.733
It ruined my talk.

1140
00:47:41.733 --> 00:47:42.716
<v Voiceover>You started crying?</v>

1141
00:47:42.716 --> 00:47:44.073
<v ->All choked up.</v>

1142
00:47:44.073 --> 00:47:47.359
I leaned on the other hand, she didn't get choked up,

1143
00:47:47.359 --> 00:47:50.198
she just flat out bawls at the top of her lungs.

1144
00:47:50.561 --> 00:47:51.418
Okay?

1145
00:47:51.418 --> 00:47:54.399
So, she doesn't have, not any whatsoever.

1146
00:47:54.399 --> 00:47:56.035
<v Voiceover>That's beautiful.</v>

1147
00:47:56.035 --> 00:47:58.922
You know, it's just, I said, be a man.

1148
00:48:01.764 --> 00:48:04.699
But I said, my god, if I'm blessed enough,

1149
00:48:04.699 --> 00:48:07.021
it would help people like this,

1150
00:48:07.548 --> 00:48:10.205
I just have to hand it back.

1151
00:48:10.205 --> 00:48:12.375
So, I said, anyone who's autistic,

1152
00:48:12.375 --> 00:48:15.213
if I find that frequency, which is almost everyone who is,

1153
00:48:15.213 --> 00:48:16.662
there's no choice, free.

1154
00:48:17.819 --> 00:48:19.424
And so it is.

1155
00:48:19.424 --> 00:48:21.889
And then right after that, someone said to me,

1156
00:48:21.889 --> 00:48:24.198
how about down syndrome, and I said,

1157
00:48:24.198 --> 00:48:25.464
this is one of the many times I've been wrong,

1158
00:48:25.464 --> 00:48:28.601
a lot of times, I don't think so 'cause you look at these

1159
00:48:28.601 --> 00:48:31.850
down syndrome people that it's so structural, you know?

1160
00:48:32.534 --> 00:48:35.090
That's when the ledgers started coming in, the emails.

1161
00:48:35.605 --> 00:48:40.509
It was, it's not now, my child's handed this thing down

1162
00:48:40.509 --> 00:48:44.268
so much, that glasses fall over his ears,

1163
00:48:44.609 --> 00:48:47.519
and on, and on, his body has changed, et cetera.

1164
00:48:47.519 --> 00:48:50.649
I said, okay, include down syndrome in it,

1165
00:48:50.649 --> 00:48:52.425
and now I'm waiting to see.

1166
00:48:52.425 --> 00:48:55.162
I don't wanna do it until I know that it's successful.

1167
00:48:55.162 --> 00:48:57.528
Now I'm waiting to see the results with

1168
00:48:57.528 --> 00:49:00.396
two frequencies that I've been studying at a great length.

1169
00:49:00.396 --> 00:49:03.083
Cerebral palsy and ALS.

1170
00:49:04.432 --> 00:49:05.939
So, I'll find out.

1171
00:49:05.939 --> 00:49:08.511
<v Voiceover>Well, there's clearly no room for you</v>

1172
00:49:08.511 --> 00:49:10.089
to retire here.

1173
00:49:10.369 --> 00:49:11.147
Sorry.

1174
00:49:13.008 --> 00:49:14.885
Besides, I think you're having too much fun

1175
00:49:14.885 --> 00:49:17.657
doing what you're doing to retire anyway.

1176
00:49:18.081 --> 00:49:20.590
<v ->It's grueling at times, but you know what?</v>

1177
00:49:20.886 --> 00:49:21.622
What isn't?

1178
00:49:21.622 --> 00:49:22.727
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

1179
00:49:23.559 --> 00:49:27.161
<v ->To be blessed so that you have found</v>

1180
00:49:27.161 --> 00:49:29.361
your life's work, and in finding it,

1181
00:49:29.361 --> 00:49:32.294
to be able to help people as much as I do,

1182
00:49:32.294 --> 00:49:35.240
I mean, you know, what room do I have to complain?

1183
00:49:36.504 --> 00:49:37.535
Right?

1184
00:49:37.535 --> 00:49:39.900
And when I began to, I get a clear cut message.

1185
00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:41.323
Steph, shut up.

1186
00:49:41.975 --> 00:49:43.474
That's it.

1187
00:49:43.474 --> 00:49:45.601
That's it, is that a wrap?

1188
00:49:45.601 --> 00:49:46.842
<v Voiceover>That's a wrap.</v>

1189
00:49:46.842 --> 00:49:48.841
(ambient music)

1190
00:49:48.841 --> 00:49:50.385
We're intrigued enough that we've decided

1191
00:49:50.385 --> 00:49:52.008
to begin the AIM program ourselves

1192
00:49:52.008 --> 00:49:53.740
and we'll let you know what effects we're feeling

1193
00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:54.956
in the months ahead.

1194
00:49:54.956 --> 00:49:56.819
Meanwhile, for more information on AIM,

1195
00:49:56.819 --> 00:49:58.481
go to the website below.

1196
00:49:58.481 --> 00:50:01.311
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
