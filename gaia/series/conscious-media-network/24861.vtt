00:00:01.029 --> 00:00:04.120
<v ->Kahu Fred Sterling is a bona fide medium.</v>

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.464
He channels a being known as Kireal.

3
00:00:06.464 --> 00:00:09.087
This relationship has lasted more than 20 years,

4
00:00:09.087 --> 00:00:10.928
throughout which a great deal of information

5
00:00:10.928 --> 00:00:12.445
has been brought to light.

6
00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:15.297
His journey into mediumship was totally unexpected,

7
00:00:15.297 --> 00:00:16.792
even embarrassing to him,

8
00:00:16.792 --> 00:00:18.679
as he was enjoying a successful career

9
00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:21.921
as an automobile dealership general manager.

10
00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:23.577
Today, thousands of people show up

11
00:00:23.577 --> 00:00:26.360
for his presentations to hear Kirael's words,

12
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.453
some of which may be very startling.

13
00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:33.050 line:15% 
(mystical music)

14
00:00:38.023 --> 00:00:40.644
Kahu, you've had a very interesting journey in life,

15
00:00:40.644 --> 00:00:42.047
and you've ridden through a lot of

16
00:00:42.047 --> 00:00:44.617
really imperative information

17
00:00:44.617 --> 00:00:46.560
that peoples of the planet really need

18
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.237
at this point in time.

19
00:00:48.237 --> 00:00:50.216
But that's not where you began.

20
00:00:51.573 --> 00:00:53.255
This has been a long journey,

21
00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:55.395
and if you wouldn't mind, just for a few minutes

22
00:00:55.395 --> 00:00:58.658
giving us some background on your roots.

23
00:00:59.923 --> 00:01:01.812
<v ->Well, that's a really interesting thought,</v>

24
00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:04.158
because I don't,

25
00:01:04.158 --> 00:01:07.562
I have very good memories up until

26
00:01:07.562 --> 00:01:10.632
about eight from, I had nothing from zero to eight.

27
00:01:10.632 --> 00:01:13.663
My mother was married, very embarrassing,

28
00:01:13.663 --> 00:01:15.939
but she was married seven times.

29
00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.574
And I was party to one of 'em,

30
00:01:17.574 --> 00:01:21.276
I was about the third or fourth one in to be born, and

31
00:01:21.276 --> 00:01:23.783
so it was very hard for me to

32
00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:26.411
have a bunch of things to talk about.

33
00:01:26.411 --> 00:01:28.728
As I said the first eight years, I have nothing there,

34
00:01:28.728 --> 00:01:30.333
zero, blank.

35
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:31.971
But from that point on I had some

36
00:01:31.971 --> 00:01:34.253
really good things that took place.

37
00:01:34.253 --> 00:01:35.910
You know, my schooling was good,

38
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.865
and a lot of the things that

39
00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:40.325
I think people pray for in their life,

40
00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:41.729
and I use the word prayer,

41
00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.511
I'll probably do it 10 times throughout this interview,

42
00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:47.351
I use the word pray not because

43
00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:49.386
I'm a minister, yes, I am,

44
00:01:49.386 --> 00:01:52.309
but I don't use prayer as a lead to anything,

45
00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:54.587
yet I do pray a lot, because

46
00:01:54.587 --> 00:01:56.749
this whole journey, what I'm trying to say to you is this,

47
00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.566
this whole journey of my childhood

48
00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:01.740
was really matter-of-fact, about eight years old,

49
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.144
my mother had another son, the final son,

50
00:02:05.144 --> 00:02:09.307
and the father left very quickly thereafter.

51
00:02:09.307 --> 00:02:11.177
There's a couple more husbands

52
00:02:11.177 --> 00:02:13.799
beyond that point, but this,

53
00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.593
this whole journey, I became his father

54
00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:16.814
at nine or 10 years old.

55
00:02:16.814 --> 00:02:17.711
<v Host>Your brother's father.</v>

56
00:02:17.711 --> 00:02:19.896
<v ->Yeah, right, so at nine or 10 years old</v>

57
00:02:19.896 --> 00:02:22.265
I had this baby brother,

58
00:02:22.265 --> 00:02:23.393
and it was really,

59
00:02:24.726 --> 00:02:26.684
caused me to grow very quickly,

60
00:02:26.684 --> 00:02:30.227
and I think that probably for much of my,

61
00:02:30.227 --> 00:02:31.446
what I'm doing right now

62
00:02:31.446 --> 00:02:33.170
had a bearing on that right there because

63
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.770
I had to grow up at 10 or 11 years old

64
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.021
because I had to, believe or not,

65
00:02:38.921 --> 00:02:40.693
I say this without any hesitation

66
00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:41.981
because it's really truth.

67
00:02:41.981 --> 00:02:44.372
I remember my mother telling me that

68
00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:46.574
it's important for me to go to school,

69
00:02:46.574 --> 00:02:48.333
but I had to get her up and get her to work

70
00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:50.266
at midnight every night.

71
00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:53.043
She worked midnight to eight in the morning.

72
00:02:53.043 --> 00:02:55.396
So I had to get her up at 11.

73
00:02:55.396 --> 00:02:56.523
I had to go out and start the car.

74
00:02:56.523 --> 00:02:58.938
It was the winter, had to go out, start the car,

75
00:02:58.938 --> 00:03:01.539
and then come back in and fix her lunch

76
00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:02.964
to take to work.

77
00:03:02.964 --> 00:03:04.573
So people'd say, "Oh, you poor thing."

78
00:03:04.573 --> 00:03:05.677
Well it wasn't really a poor thing,

79
00:03:05.677 --> 00:03:07.655
because that's the only thing I knew,

80
00:03:07.655 --> 00:03:10.004
so it wasn't that bad, but it did have a

81
00:03:10.004 --> 00:03:13.409
major effect on my schooling, that period,

82
00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.938
and I just barely got through high school.

83
00:03:15.938 --> 00:03:17.642
I'll be very honest with you, I just barely got through

84
00:03:17.642 --> 00:03:19.988
this whole journey, and then

85
00:03:19.988 --> 00:03:20.907
I didn't know what to do.

86
00:03:20.907 --> 00:03:22.173
<v Host>Where was this in the world?</v>

87
00:03:22.173 --> 00:03:24.265
<v ->New York, New York, Poughkeepsie, New York.</v>

88
00:03:24.265 --> 00:03:26.152
People might not even know this, but

89
00:03:26.152 --> 00:03:27.808
not, see, there you go.

90
00:03:27.808 --> 00:03:28.776
It's not really Poughkeepsie,

91
00:03:28.776 --> 00:03:31.374
it's a little place called Dover Plains, New York,

92
00:03:31.374 --> 00:03:32.939
which you blink and you go,

93
00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:34.480
there's no stop light or anything, so,

94
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.928
you could have missed it.

95
00:03:35.928 --> 00:03:37.746
But anyway, what I was saying is that

96
00:03:37.746 --> 00:03:40.575
right soon after that, right after my high school,

97
00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:42.671
I was working at Holland Valley State Hospital

98
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:45.545
which a criminally insane place, but

99
00:03:47.086 --> 00:03:49.345
it was shortly thereafter I got this little piece,

100
00:03:49.345 --> 00:03:51.899
letter from the government, said,

101
00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:54.681
"Greetings and saluations, we want you in the Army."

102
00:03:54.681 --> 00:03:56.336
And I thought, well, that's gonna be great,

103
00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:58.088
but who's gonna take care of my kid brother,

104
00:03:58.088 --> 00:04:00.733
my mother, and so on and so forth.

105
00:04:00.733 --> 00:04:02.135
Well they didn't leave me any options,

106
00:04:02.135 --> 00:04:03.702
there was no options made, so

107
00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:06.232
I went in the Army, and that was the greatest thing,

108
00:04:06.232 --> 00:04:07.038
because

109
00:04:08.854 --> 00:04:11.825
via Vietnam I got through this Vietnam thing

110
00:04:11.825 --> 00:04:16.077
and met my wife in Hawaii,

111
00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.723
'69 I, '68 or '69, I'm sorry.

112
00:04:20.723 --> 00:04:23.931
She's gonna yell at me, but '68 or '69, and

113
00:04:25.238 --> 00:04:27.745
that was the end of my career for my wife,

114
00:04:27.745 --> 00:04:30.079
my mother and my son.

115
00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:32.729
My son, see, I'm saying, my own brother.

116
00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.047
My older brother and my older sister

117
00:04:35.047 --> 00:04:38.174
had long since been out of the picture.

118
00:04:38.174 --> 00:04:40.221
So that whole journey was more than I really,

119
00:04:40.221 --> 00:04:42.453
I have talked more about you, with you,

120
00:04:42.453 --> 00:04:45.169
than I've talked to anybody in a long time, because

121
00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.458
people don't even know that I have

122
00:04:46.458 --> 00:04:49.148
a younger brother, (laughs) or a mother,

123
00:04:49.148 --> 00:04:50.343
or anything else.

124
00:04:50.343 --> 00:04:53.979
They're all gone now, my mother died, but

125
00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.141
my brother lives in Colorado.

126
00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:58.925
I have one brother that's a Mormon elder.

127
00:04:58.925 --> 00:05:01.045
It's so cute. (chuckles)

128
00:05:01.045 --> 00:05:04.313
'Cause every time when I fly over the California,

129
00:05:04.313 --> 00:05:05.740
this area right here, I can see

130
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.407
she's blessing her because

131
00:05:08.407 --> 00:05:10.959
it's probably, I be a medium and everything,

132
00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:14.142
it's really hard on her, you know. (laughs)

133
00:05:14.142 --> 00:05:15.013
So anyway,

134
00:05:15.013 --> 00:05:16.346
<v Host>Yeah, you were probably a little hard to swallow</v>

135
00:05:16.346 --> 00:05:19.013
for the family, huh?
<v Kahu>Oh, yes, yes, yes.</v>

136
00:05:20.188 --> 00:05:22.190
Really quick story, my sister,

137
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.570
who I thought all this time,

138
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.089
was the only two of us in the family

139
00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:26.606
that had the same mother and father,

140
00:05:26.606 --> 00:05:28.859
which would be Don, my father,

141
00:05:28.859 --> 00:05:31.712
and just about oh, a couple a,

142
00:05:31.712 --> 00:05:33.904
two years before my stroke,

143
00:05:33.904 --> 00:05:36.184
about a year before my stroke I had stroke,

144
00:05:36.184 --> 00:05:38.805
my sister called and she said

145
00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:39.567
she was devastated.

146
00:05:39.567 --> 00:05:41.084
I said, "What happened?"

147
00:05:41.084 --> 00:05:43.269
She'd just started following my career,

148
00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:47.386
and been enjoying it I think, anyway,

149
00:05:47.386 --> 00:05:49.295
but anyway, something was said

150
00:05:49.295 --> 00:05:52.100
and she needed to get her birth certificate.

151
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.309
So she wrote to Watertown, New York

152
00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:56.509
to get her birth certificate and she got it back and,

153
00:05:58.722 --> 00:06:00.253
her father wasn't on.

154
00:06:00.253 --> 00:06:03.008
It was Don's brother. (laughs)

155
00:06:03.008 --> 00:06:04.620
<v Host>Oh no.</v>
We didn't even know.

156
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.534
<v Host>Oh, your mom was a live wire. (laughs)</v>

157
00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:12.831
<v ->You know, and I don't know why,</v>

158
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:13.846
what happened at that point,

159
00:06:13.846 --> 00:06:16.192
but we haven't had much contact since then.

160
00:06:16.192 --> 00:06:18.400
Yeah, really, so again, my whole family is,

161
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.979
my family is my wife and my son.

162
00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:20.989
That's my whole family.

163
00:06:20.989 --> 00:06:22.021
I mean really seriously.

164
00:06:22.021 --> 00:06:23.814
<v Host>But you have Native American blood.</v>

165
00:06:23.814 --> 00:06:25.633
<v ->Absolutely, yes.</v>

166
00:06:25.633 --> 00:06:27.260
<v Host>Is that on the mother or father's side?</v>

167
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.318
<v ->It was on my mother's side.</v>

168
00:06:28.318 --> 00:06:30.181
<v Host>On your mother's side, okay.</v>

169
00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:30.895
<v ->Most assuredly.</v>

170
00:06:30.895 --> 00:06:32.963
<v Host>So now, as you come back from Vietnam,</v>

171
00:06:32.963 --> 00:06:35.171
at what point in your life,

172
00:06:35.171 --> 00:06:36.621
because we want to get into some

173
00:06:36.621 --> 00:06:38.713
very meaty topics here,

174
00:06:38.713 --> 00:06:42.048
did you start noticing this ability

175
00:06:42.048 --> 00:06:43.313
in terms of mediumship,

176
00:06:43.313 --> 00:06:45.245
and when did you meet Kireal?

177
00:06:45.245 --> 00:06:46.096
Is it Kireal?

178
00:06:46.096 --> 00:06:48.070
<v ->Kireal, yeah.</v>

179
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.243
When did I meet him?

180
00:06:49.243 --> 00:06:52.119
About 20, roughly about 22 years

181
00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:54.142
after I came out of Vietnam.

182
00:06:54.142 --> 00:06:55.913
<v Host>How'd that happen?</v>
I had a whole new world.

183
00:06:55.913 --> 00:06:57.524
I went into this journey and,

184
00:06:57.524 --> 00:06:59.524
remember, I only had a high school education.

185
00:06:59.524 --> 00:07:02.147
And it was, that was back,

186
00:07:02.147 --> 00:07:03.918
at that time was more important

187
00:07:03.918 --> 00:07:06.356
for everybody to think I had a great education,

188
00:07:06.356 --> 00:07:07.758
so on and so forth, but I didn't.

189
00:07:07.758 --> 00:07:09.665
I told everybody truth, you know.

190
00:07:09.665 --> 00:07:11.139
And so I went in the car business,

191
00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:13.141
the automobile business, and

192
00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:16.592
this again, this is wonderful, because

193
00:07:16.592 --> 00:07:18.522
I'm glad to say this, because

194
00:07:18.522 --> 00:07:20.270
I started out as a lot boy,

195
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.261
and scrubbing the overheads inside the cars,

196
00:07:24.261 --> 00:07:27.123
and there was a little 20-car lot,

197
00:07:27.123 --> 00:07:29.975
and the guy, Don again, like my father's name,

198
00:07:29.975 --> 00:07:32.391
but anyway, Don said you couldn't make it

199
00:07:32.391 --> 00:07:35.065
in the big car sales, but you can

200
00:07:35.065 --> 00:07:37.034
clean my cars for me, and I said okay.

201
00:07:37.034 --> 00:07:38.115
I was working driving an ambulance,

202
00:07:38.115 --> 00:07:41.066
'cause I was, bein' medic, combat medic.

203
00:07:41.066 --> 00:07:43.085
It wasn't hard for me to get a job

204
00:07:43.085 --> 00:07:45.380
drivin' an ambulance, right?

205
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.919
So I had the two jobs, and

206
00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:48.646
I was goin' down there every day,

207
00:07:48.646 --> 00:07:50.900
and my wife was already pregnant,

208
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.318
and so anyway, long story made short,

209
00:07:53.318 --> 00:07:55.107
a man by the name of Mike Salta Pontiac,

210
00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:56.946
or Mike Salta came in and opened up

211
00:07:56.946 --> 00:08:00.051
a Pontiac dealership in Hawaii.

212
00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:02.330
If you wanted to buy a car, any car in Hawaii,

213
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.537
you went to the dealer and you got the list price

214
00:08:04.537 --> 00:08:06.216
and you paid it and then you left.

215
00:08:06.216 --> 00:08:08.329
Well, Mike Salta came in, and he said,

216
00:08:08.329 --> 00:08:09.826
"Come in and make us an offer."

217
00:08:09.826 --> 00:08:12.856
And we went, "How does that work?"

218
00:08:12.856 --> 00:08:15.405
So he had to train the whole state of Hawaii

219
00:08:15.405 --> 00:08:16.513
how to buy a car.

220
00:08:16.513 --> 00:08:17.342
And he did.

221
00:08:17.342 --> 00:08:18.992
We did it.

222
00:08:18.992 --> 00:08:20.901
I got the job, and

223
00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:22.580
started out as a salesman.

224
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.432
Went through salesman, assistant manager,

225
00:08:25.432 --> 00:08:28.511
finance manager, used car manager,

226
00:08:28.511 --> 00:08:30.601
new car manager, director of sales,

227
00:08:30.601 --> 00:08:32.122
and finally went all the way to the top

228
00:08:32.122 --> 00:08:33.639
into general manager.

229
00:08:33.639 --> 00:08:36.399
And I'm, it was really fascinating,

230
00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:39.778
because at this point is where I met Master Kireal.

231
00:08:39.778 --> 00:08:41.459
At the height of my career,

232
00:08:41.459 --> 00:08:42.653
of money,
<v Host>In auto sales.</v>

233
00:08:42.653 --> 00:08:43.437
<v Kahu>Oh yeah,</v>

234
00:08:43.437 --> 00:08:44.324
and we're not talkin'
<v Host>Okay, tell me how</v>

235
00:08:44.324 --> 00:08:45.131
this happened.

236
00:08:45.131 --> 00:08:48.579
<v ->(laughs) I'm not totally,</v>

237
00:08:48.579 --> 00:08:50.686
well I do know how, but

238
00:08:50.686 --> 00:08:53.811
I was at the pinnacle of my career

239
00:08:53.811 --> 00:08:56.010
with this whole journey, and

240
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.553
my wife was doing things behind,

241
00:08:59.553 --> 00:09:01.441
not behind my back by any stretch of imagination,

242
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:03.994
but she was doin' all this stuff that I wasn't invited to,

243
00:09:03.994 --> 00:09:05.374
and because I didn't want to be invited

244
00:09:05.374 --> 00:09:07.444
to this whole journey, right.

245
00:09:07.444 --> 00:09:09.589
But I just wanted to go and see what she was doing, so

246
00:09:09.589 --> 00:09:10.503
<v Host>And are you talking things</v>

247
00:09:10.503 --> 00:09:12.738
of a more spiritual or metaphysical, paranormal

248
00:09:12.738 --> 00:09:14.204
nature?
<v Kahu>All of it,</v>

249
00:09:14.204 --> 00:09:16.658
right there, 'cause I was taking it,

250
00:09:16.658 --> 00:09:19.347
I would go this, right, you know. (laughs)

251
00:09:19.347 --> 00:09:20.314
But anyway, I thought just to,

252
00:09:20.314 --> 00:09:21.739
I'd go check it out and make sure,

253
00:09:21.739 --> 00:09:24.591
'cause any could be very uncomfortable for her,

254
00:09:24.591 --> 00:09:28.525
and my job, it doesn't look good for my job.

255
00:09:28.525 --> 00:09:29.978
What I'm saying to you is that

256
00:09:29.978 --> 00:09:31.312
the difference between the general manager

257
00:09:31.312 --> 00:09:33.865
and a salesman is a world of,

258
00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:35.867
this world beyond worlds.

259
00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:37.407
But this whole journey was,

260
00:09:37.407 --> 00:09:39.546
I was gonna check, I think I was checking for her,

261
00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:42.191
but maybe check for myself, I'm not sure.

262
00:09:42.191 --> 00:09:43.874
But anyway, I went there, and

263
00:09:43.874 --> 00:09:46.022
met this lovely lady.

264
00:09:47.432 --> 00:09:48.992
She was called a medium.

265
00:09:48.992 --> 00:09:50.764
I said, "A medium, what's a medium?"

266
00:09:50.764 --> 00:09:53.108
I didn't know what a medium was.

267
00:09:53.108 --> 00:09:53.960
So anyway I went to,

268
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.524
and I went through this whole journey,

269
00:09:55.524 --> 00:09:57.135
and I just loved her.

270
00:09:57.135 --> 00:10:00.584
She was so pronounced and so,

271
00:10:00.584 --> 00:10:03.459
she was so sweet and kind, there was nothing

272
00:10:04.659 --> 00:10:07.426
about the bad things in life, and this and all that.

273
00:10:07.426 --> 00:10:09.599
Everything had a good, positive spin, so

274
00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:12.213
about a week later I told Patti, I said,

275
00:10:12.213 --> 00:10:12.927
"I want to go back again."

276
00:10:12.927 --> 00:10:14.468
She said, "You want to what?"

277
00:10:14.468 --> 00:10:15.870
And I said I want to go back again.

278
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:16.835
She said, "Why?"

279
00:10:16.835 --> 00:10:19.289
And I said, "Well because I need to check and make sure,"

280
00:10:19.289 --> 00:10:20.909
what I was seeing, you know.

281
00:10:20.909 --> 00:10:22.926
So I went, and about three or four times,

282
00:10:22.926 --> 00:10:25.433
seriously, almost week after week,

283
00:10:25.433 --> 00:10:29.251
and this lady was channeling every week, and

284
00:10:29.251 --> 00:10:31.528
I'll never forget it, because one night,

285
00:10:31.528 --> 00:10:33.022
I got there.

286
00:10:33.022 --> 00:10:35.944
And first of all, they had her sit like here,

287
00:10:35.944 --> 00:10:38.156
then had these chairs around her like this,

288
00:10:38.156 --> 00:10:41.260
like a U-shape, and I sat outside that one.

289
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.779
So I sat behind that.

290
00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:43.745
'Cause I didn't want everybody to think

291
00:10:43.745 --> 00:10:45.723
I was part of this whole journey, right.

292
00:10:47.195 --> 00:10:49.589
I think, this is what happened is,

293
00:10:49.589 --> 00:10:51.705
I know it happened because I just dozed off.

294
00:10:51.705 --> 00:10:54.970
I just (inhales) and went down, and

295
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:56.512
the next thing I knew I was waking up

296
00:10:56.512 --> 00:10:59.942
and the U of people had changed their positions

297
00:10:59.942 --> 00:11:01.298
and they were all facing me.

298
00:11:01.298 --> 00:11:02.242
<v Host>Oh my gosh.</v>

299
00:11:02.242 --> 00:11:04.864
<v ->Yeah, that's where Master Kireal came in.</v>

300
00:11:04.864 --> 00:11:08.199
So what I say to you and everybody out there listening,

301
00:11:08.199 --> 00:11:10.822
I am a full-blown medium, I mean full-blown medium,

302
00:11:10.822 --> 00:11:14.087
because I have no idea where I'm gonna go,

303
00:11:14.087 --> 00:11:16.962
but, now after this many years I know what to do,

304
00:11:16.962 --> 00:11:19.353
but for the first time I was scared.

305
00:11:19.353 --> 00:11:20.733
I walked away from that meeting,

306
00:11:20.733 --> 00:11:22.780
I didn't want anything to do with this, period.

307
00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.507
Because lady had a little

308
00:11:26.507 --> 00:11:28.140
tape recorder, and she played it back,

309
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.980
and he has a,

310
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.901
you can hear it later on in the program,

311
00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:36.327
but he has a defined

312
00:11:36.327 --> 00:11:37.876
Scottish accent.

313
00:11:37.876 --> 00:11:40.152
Defined Scottish accent.

314
00:11:40.152 --> 00:11:42.569
And in fact so much then,

315
00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:43.995
you couldn't even hardly understand it

316
00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:46.962
because it was so thick and brogue-ish.

317
00:11:46.962 --> 00:11:48.825
But anyway, that was my whole journey right there.

318
00:11:48.825 --> 00:11:50.343
That was where Master Kireal came in,

319
00:11:50.343 --> 00:11:53.149
and I think it was about

320
00:11:53.149 --> 00:11:56.051
41 or 42 years old when it started.

321
00:11:56.051 --> 00:11:58.881
And I'm a little bit older than that now for sure. (laughs)

322
00:11:58.881 --> 00:12:01.974
But it's 20 years I've been working with him.

323
00:12:01.974 --> 00:12:03.416
20 years, and I always want to say this

324
00:12:03.416 --> 00:12:06.844
because I love him so much, but

325
00:12:06.844 --> 00:12:10.854
he has never ever sat in this chair

326
00:12:10.854 --> 00:12:13.816
and had opportunity to speak to somebody

327
00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:16.924
and have somethin', just because he,

328
00:12:16.924 --> 00:12:19.432
he said it yesterday, he's saying it today,

329
00:12:19.432 --> 00:12:22.860
I've never heard him repeat anything with anybody.

330
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:23.597
Unbelievable.

331
00:12:23.597 --> 00:12:25.872
Now if you talk about

332
00:12:25.872 --> 00:12:28.773
the President or other things, the new President

333
00:12:28.773 --> 00:12:29.670
and so on and so forth,

334
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.016
he has a few things he wants to say about them, you know,

335
00:12:32.016 --> 00:12:32.849
And I know what they are.
<v Host>And we're going</v>

336
00:12:32.849 --> 00:12:33.619
to go into that.

337
00:12:33.619 --> 00:12:35.439
<v ->Yeah, okay, so that was my whole journey,</v>

338
00:12:35.439 --> 00:12:37.061
and that's probably more information

339
00:12:37.061 --> 00:12:38.509
than you'll ever want, but that's

340
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:39.999
really what it is.
<v Host>No, no that's,</v>

341
00:12:39.999 --> 00:12:41.777
I'm fascinated.

342
00:12:42.927 --> 00:12:43.897
It is amazing.

343
00:12:43.897 --> 00:12:46.658
I think that so many of the people that I've met

344
00:12:46.658 --> 00:12:49.463
who are genuine mediums,

345
00:12:50.798 --> 00:12:52.525
it usually came upon quite accidentally.

346
00:12:52.525 --> 00:12:54.204
It was not invited in.

347
00:12:54.204 --> 00:12:58.024
It was something that came about, so to speak.

348
00:12:58.024 --> 00:13:00.391
And to me that always,

349
00:13:00.391 --> 00:13:03.588
on a psychological level, that always adds this

350
00:13:03.588 --> 00:13:05.405
kind of authenticity,
(Kahu laughs)

351
00:13:05.405 --> 00:13:07.475
shall we say, because it wasn't as though

352
00:13:07.475 --> 00:13:09.614
they were studying and looking for it.

353
00:13:09.614 --> 00:13:11.477
It was there whether they liked it or not.

354
00:13:11.477 --> 00:13:13.363
And so I love that part of the story.

355
00:13:13.363 --> 00:13:15.364
<v ->Let me just add this in.</v>

356
00:13:15.364 --> 00:13:19.803
I had a high income of six-digit income

357
00:13:19.803 --> 00:13:21.183
when he came in.

358
00:13:21.183 --> 00:13:23.022
<v Host>Uh-oh.</v>
Yeah, uh-oh,

359
00:13:23.022 --> 00:13:24.748
down the hills, you know.

360
00:13:24.748 --> 00:13:27.118
<v Host>So what happened to your six-figure income</v>

361
00:13:27.118 --> 00:13:29.992
after this experience where everyone seated around you

362
00:13:29.992 --> 00:13:31.164
listening to you do something you were

363
00:13:31.164 --> 00:13:32.523
totally unaware of.

364
00:13:32.523 --> 00:13:35.166
<v ->Well, as I said, I was going to say,</v>

365
00:13:35.166 --> 00:13:38.158
I did it, for some time I had nothing to do with it,

366
00:13:38.158 --> 00:13:40.204
because it was too freaky for me,

367
00:13:40.204 --> 00:13:41.975
because his voice was comin' out of my body.

368
00:13:41.975 --> 00:13:44.075
It wasn't my voice, and I didn't like it,

369
00:13:44.075 --> 00:13:46.463
and I thought maybe that I might have,

370
00:13:48.098 --> 00:13:50.007
I didn't know what was happening.

371
00:13:50.007 --> 00:13:51.710
But after a while I got back to it,

372
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.227
and then I was actually transferred

373
00:13:53.227 --> 00:13:55.207
up to Sacramento, California.

374
00:13:55.207 --> 00:13:55.758
<v Host>Really?</v>

375
00:13:55.758 --> 00:13:56.862
<v ->Yeah, that's right.</v>

376
00:13:56.862 --> 00:13:59.662
My general managership brought me up here,

377
00:13:59.662 --> 00:14:01.809
and it's right here in this city

378
00:14:01.809 --> 00:14:04.481
I did my first public appearance

379
00:14:04.481 --> 00:14:06.732
being the general manager from

380
00:14:06.732 --> 00:14:10.205
the Florin Acura Dealership.

381
00:14:10.205 --> 00:14:12.597
It was one of the high line cars back then,

382
00:14:12.597 --> 00:14:14.782
20 years ago, you know, and

383
00:14:14.782 --> 00:14:18.063
so I wanted to do it with a mask on or something,

384
00:14:18.063 --> 00:14:19.910
But I didn't.

385
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:21.982
So anyway, you're really question is

386
00:14:21.982 --> 00:14:24.879
is how did I cope with this loss of income

387
00:14:24.879 --> 00:14:26.030
because I los--

388
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.754
<v Host>Well, first of all, how'd you lose your income,</v>

389
00:14:27.754 --> 00:14:29.110
and how did you cope?

390
00:14:30.146 --> 00:14:33.736
<v ->(chuckles) I went back to Hawaii for a vacation.</v>

391
00:14:33.736 --> 00:14:36.220
Been up here for about a year or so.

392
00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.372
And I was there and met another man

393
00:14:39.372 --> 00:14:42.200
in Hawaii that wanted me to be general manager

394
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:46.156
at his for a Rolls Royce upline dealership,

395
00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:49.081
which I said for years, I said

396
00:14:49.081 --> 00:14:52.302
this was the worst thing that ever happened to me,

397
00:14:52.302 --> 00:14:55.016
not knowing who was behind all of this.

398
00:14:55.016 --> 00:14:57.178
And I'll tell you in a minute, because

399
00:14:57.178 --> 00:14:59.914
it was about a year I was working for him,

400
00:14:59.914 --> 00:15:02.835
I'd been with Salta for like 20 years,

401
00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:06.309
and about a year later he called me into his office,

402
00:15:06.309 --> 00:15:09.804
(stammers) I'm sorry, in Hawaii,

403
00:15:09.804 --> 00:15:12.357
they call me in the office and he said,

404
00:15:12.357 --> 00:15:14.546
"Fred, you've done a wonderful job.

405
00:15:16.266 --> 00:15:19.008
"You're just like walkin' on water,"

406
00:15:19.008 --> 00:15:20.297
and all this stuff he said.

407
00:15:20.297 --> 00:15:21.814
"But what you really did, you helped me realize

408
00:15:21.814 --> 00:15:24.919
"that I could do it, so you're fired."

409
00:15:24.919 --> 00:15:27.289
I'd never been fired anything, anywhere.

410
00:15:27.289 --> 00:15:28.164
I was fired.

411
00:15:28.164 --> 00:15:29.728
I sat there, and I said,

412
00:15:31.748 --> 00:15:33.041
"What do you mean, I'm fired?"

413
00:15:33.041 --> 00:15:35.618
He said, "Well, you can be a sales manager if you want to,"

414
00:15:35.618 --> 00:15:37.784
and I said, "No, I don't want to be anything,

415
00:15:37.784 --> 00:15:39.347
"what do you mean I'm fired?"

416
00:15:39.347 --> 00:15:41.416
And he said, "Well, it means you're not,

417
00:15:41.416 --> 00:15:42.705
"no longer with this company."

418
00:15:42.705 --> 00:15:45.326
And I said, "Oh my god, okay."

419
00:15:45.326 --> 00:15:46.721
So I got up and I left.

420
00:15:46.721 --> 00:15:47.880
I walked out there, I had to call Patti,

421
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.112
and I said, "I don't know how to tell you this,

422
00:15:50.112 --> 00:15:52.113
"but I don't work there anymore."

423
00:15:52.113 --> 00:15:54.459
And she said, "You were fired?"

424
00:15:54.459 --> 00:15:55.702
And I said, "Yes, fired."

425
00:15:55.702 --> 00:15:57.103
She said, "Oh my god."

426
00:15:57.103 --> 00:15:58.462
So devastation.

427
00:15:58.462 --> 00:16:01.015
Now I tried to stay in the car business.

428
00:16:01.015 --> 00:16:03.154
I had a couple of people that I'd known,

429
00:16:03.154 --> 00:16:06.590
but anyway just a matter of a few months or whatever,

430
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:11.296
and I had to get out and had to meet with Master Kirael,

431
00:16:11.296 --> 00:16:12.701
and he told me, he said,

432
00:16:14.762 --> 00:16:16.500
he didn't talk like I'm talking to you,

433
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.622
but he made me understand

434
00:16:18.622 --> 00:16:21.377
that I could make money as a medium,

435
00:16:21.377 --> 00:16:22.620
but I had to do certain things.

436
00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.690
I said, "What certain things?"

437
00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:26.116
He said, "Well, you probably have to write a book,

438
00:16:26.116 --> 00:16:26.806
"or something like that."

439
00:16:26.806 --> 00:16:27.932
I went, "Write a book?

440
00:16:27.932 --> 00:16:30.210
"I just barely got out of high school, Kirael,

441
00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:31.336
"you understand that?

442
00:16:31.336 --> 00:16:33.130
"I've been in the car business for my life,

443
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.776
"you know, it's all I know anything about anything."

444
00:16:35.776 --> 00:16:37.432
And he said, "Yeah, but you know a lot more

445
00:16:37.432 --> 00:16:38.581
"because I'm gonna help you."

446
00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:40.651
And I said, "Well, if you're gonna help."

447
00:16:40.651 --> 00:16:44.055
And he actually wrote the first book himself.

448
00:16:44.055 --> 00:16:46.110
You know, you can tell if you've read it,

449
00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:47.146
you see that
<v Host>The name of</v>

450
00:16:47.146 --> 00:16:48.114
the first book?

451
00:16:48.114 --> 00:16:49.446
<v ->The Great Shift.</v>

452
00:16:49.446 --> 00:16:53.220
The Great Shift, and he was telling right back then,

453
00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.221
20 years ago, he was telling everybody

454
00:16:55.221 --> 00:16:58.011
that this is gonna happen somewhere after 2000,

455
00:16:58.011 --> 00:17:00.034
the year 2000 year,

456
00:17:00.034 --> 00:17:02.052
at the time of this great shift.

457
00:17:03.225 --> 00:17:04.599
And I had to take

458
00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:08.150
this whole journey on face value.

459
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:11.069
I got a small little shop,

460
00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:12.863
and I put some crystals in it,

461
00:17:12.863 --> 00:17:14.038
and I put some books in it,

462
00:17:14.038 --> 00:17:15.280
and I did healings.

463
00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.015
Healings, what are healings?

464
00:17:18.015 --> 00:17:19.443
Where did all this stuff come from?

465
00:17:19.443 --> 00:17:21.138
I was like a brand new person,

466
00:17:21.138 --> 00:17:23.160
like everything was brand new for me.

467
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.027
But anyway, I did it, and then

468
00:17:24.027 --> 00:17:25.984
I had a couple of people come in that wanted jobs,

469
00:17:25.984 --> 00:17:28.490
and I said, "I'd love to, but I don't have any money.

470
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:29.685
"I don't have any money."

471
00:17:29.685 --> 00:17:30.941
They said, "Well we'll go with you.

472
00:17:30.941 --> 00:17:32.415
"And I said, "Okay."

473
00:17:32.415 --> 00:17:35.775
And one of those, Gail Jan, who's my PA right now,

474
00:17:35.775 --> 00:17:39.225
she just, she said

475
00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:40.700
this whole journey with her,

476
00:17:41.687 --> 00:17:42.656
she said that

477
00:17:44.382 --> 00:17:46.060
she wanted to do something

478
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.087
that helped mankind.

479
00:17:48.087 --> 00:17:50.676
And I said, "Okay, well, I can do that."

480
00:17:50.676 --> 00:17:52.272
Luckily my wife was working at the time.

481
00:17:52.272 --> 00:17:54.388
She was executive vice president

482
00:17:54.388 --> 00:17:57.553
of an insurance company, and so

483
00:17:57.553 --> 00:17:59.910
she helped a lot, this whole journey.

484
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.865
Over a period of time we actually started making

485
00:18:01.865 --> 00:18:05.614
when I started doing private sessions for $85 an hour,

486
00:18:05.614 --> 00:18:08.352
hour and a half, I think, some ungodly figure.

487
00:18:10.062 --> 00:18:12.564
About an hour and a half for $85,

488
00:18:12.564 --> 00:18:14.704
and that was all there was to this whole journey.

489
00:18:14.704 --> 00:18:16.568
And then I got this healing going in,

490
00:18:16.568 --> 00:18:18.912
and actually cured a lot,

491
00:18:18.912 --> 00:18:20.481
I don't want to say cured.

492
00:18:20.481 --> 00:18:22.478
Helped a lot of people find their journey

493
00:18:22.478 --> 00:18:24.042
back to health again, right.

494
00:18:24.042 --> 00:18:25.859
And it was so powerful because

495
00:18:25.859 --> 00:18:28.482
I was beginning to actually believe in myself.

496
00:18:29.912 --> 00:18:31.265
I say that in great seriousness.

497
00:18:31.265 --> 00:18:34.210
I was actually becoming to understand myself,

498
00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.511
and what I had to offer to the people

499
00:18:36.511 --> 00:18:37.915
who wanted to come see me,

500
00:18:37.915 --> 00:18:39.686
but it didn't come with money somehow.

501
00:18:39.686 --> 00:18:41.299
It didn't, people'd come in,

502
00:18:41.299 --> 00:18:44.845
and they'd, I took this lady,

503
00:18:44.845 --> 00:18:46.498
too long a story but I'll tell you this,

504
00:18:46.498 --> 00:18:48.545
she had something before she met me,

505
00:18:48.545 --> 00:18:51.555
she had a problem with her lung, and

506
00:18:52.617 --> 00:18:55.928
the doctor said, "Well, we've caught it very timely,

507
00:18:55.928 --> 00:18:58.596
"but we're gonna cut off half your lung

508
00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:00.275
"and we'll see how that goes."

509
00:19:00.275 --> 00:19:01.655
And it worked for about a year,

510
00:19:01.655 --> 00:19:03.471
and then she started coughing again,

511
00:19:03.471 --> 00:19:04.440
and she went back to the doctor and he said,

512
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.820
"Well, it's in the other lung now.

513
00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.429
"You can't cut off two half-ends."

514
00:19:07.429 --> 00:19:10.075
Two half-lobes, right.

515
00:19:10.075 --> 00:19:13.340
So they were putting the time that she'd have left

516
00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.042
to do on this earth plane.

517
00:19:15.042 --> 00:19:17.230
So she heard about me and she came into see me,

518
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:19.548
and she said, "I don't know

519
00:19:19.548 --> 00:19:21.646
"if you can help me or not, but if anybody can,

520
00:19:21.646 --> 00:19:23.165
"it's gotta be something outside of what

521
00:19:23.165 --> 00:19:25.838
"the doctor understands because they're telling me

522
00:19:25.838 --> 00:19:26.913
"I'm gonna die."

523
00:19:26.913 --> 00:19:28.477
And I said, "Well, I don't believe that,

524
00:19:28.477 --> 00:19:29.694
"but let's work and..."

525
00:19:30.901 --> 00:19:32.851
Long story short we worked for about months,

526
00:19:32.851 --> 00:19:35.979
months after month, and one night at my home,

527
00:19:35.979 --> 00:19:37.843
my phone rang,

528
00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:39.498
and it was her husband on the phone.

529
00:19:39.498 --> 00:19:42.948
And he said, "Kahu, you've gotta listen

530
00:19:42.948 --> 00:19:43.960
"to what I'm hearing."

531
00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:44.949
And I said, "What's that?"

532
00:19:44.949 --> 00:19:46.306
He said, "Just listen."

533
00:19:46.306 --> 00:19:47.686
I said, "I'm not hearing anything."

534
00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:48.400
He said, "That's right.

535
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.562
"She's not coughing."

536
00:19:50.562 --> 00:19:51.712
I said, "Well, that's strange.

537
00:19:51.712 --> 00:19:53.002
"What's she doing?

538
00:19:53.002 --> 00:19:53.853
"Get her on the phone."

539
00:19:53.853 --> 00:19:55.441
So she got on the phone, and I said,

540
00:19:55.441 --> 00:19:56.270
"How long has it been?"

541
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:59.536
She said, "Well, it's about two months now,"

542
00:19:59.536 --> 00:20:01.905
I'm sorry, "two weeks ago."

543
00:20:01.905 --> 00:20:03.262
And I said, "When did it stop?"

544
00:20:03.262 --> 00:20:04.849
She said, "Right after our last appointment,

545
00:20:04.849 --> 00:20:07.126
"it just stopped, just cold."

546
00:20:07.126 --> 00:20:09.794
So she said, "I'm gonna go see the doctor,

547
00:20:09.794 --> 00:20:11.172
"and see what he says."

548
00:20:12.577 --> 00:20:13.293
She went and saw the doctor

549
00:20:13.293 --> 00:20:15.384
and she came down to the healing center

550
00:20:15.384 --> 00:20:17.445
and she said, "I'm cured.

551
00:20:17.445 --> 00:20:18.467
"It's all gone.

552
00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:20.560
"It's nothing on my lung, anywhere.

553
00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.872
"They were so shocked."

554
00:20:21.872 --> 00:20:24.034
But the reason I bring this up is because

555
00:20:24.034 --> 00:20:26.127
that was my first example, many since,

556
00:20:26.127 --> 00:20:27.760
but this was my first example

557
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.634
of somebody coming to me and something telling,

558
00:20:30.634 --> 00:20:33.785
the doctor saying that there's no hope for you.

559
00:20:33.785 --> 00:20:36.936
There's no hope for you, and it says

560
00:20:36.936 --> 00:20:40.524
right in the medical journal this is incurable.

561
00:20:40.524 --> 00:20:42.525
Well, not only is it,

562
00:20:42.525 --> 00:20:45.784
did they have to go back and re-print the journal.

563
00:20:45.784 --> 00:20:46.667
And they couldn't put in it for me,

564
00:20:46.667 --> 00:20:47.794
'cause you know, they can't just say,

565
00:20:47.794 --> 00:20:49.983
"Some healer goin' boo-boo," you know.

566
00:20:49.983 --> 00:20:51.772
That's not (chuckles)

567
00:20:51.772 --> 00:20:53.405
<v Host>Doesn't wash with the AMA, yeah.</v>

568
00:20:53.405 --> 00:20:55.932
<v ->That's right, so anyway, that was my first</v>

569
00:20:57.361 --> 00:20:59.114
really powerful experience.

570
00:20:59.114 --> 00:21:01.803
And she gave me a hundred dollars.

571
00:21:03.025 --> 00:21:04.521
A hundred dollars, and I thought that was great.

572
00:21:04.521 --> 00:21:06.545
Just wonderful, a hundred dollars, oh my god,

573
00:21:06.545 --> 00:21:08.937
that's so, amazed, because

574
00:21:08.937 --> 00:21:10.294
people were giving five.

575
00:21:10.294 --> 00:21:13.283
I had a lady come in and give me two

576
00:21:13.283 --> 00:21:17.042
packages of onions and cabbage head.

577
00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:18.810
I mean that's how bad it was, you know.

578
00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.121
I'm trying to run a business and they're giving,

579
00:21:20.121 --> 00:21:21.799
tryin' to pay me off with cabbage heads.

580
00:21:21.799 --> 00:21:23.911
(laughing)

581
00:21:23.911 --> 00:21:24.802
It's that simple.

582
00:21:24.802 --> 00:21:26.493
<v Host>After a six-figure income.</v>

583
00:21:26.493 --> 00:21:28.637
<v ->Oh, yes, from six, this is a wish--</v>

584
00:21:28.637 --> 00:21:30.890
<v Host>But this healing journey was then</v>

585
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:33.075
that you fully recognized that it had begun,

586
00:21:33.075 --> 00:21:34.364
and I need to ask you a question.

587
00:21:34.364 --> 00:21:35.906
What does Kahu mean?

588
00:21:35.906 --> 00:21:38.987
<v ->Kahu is this, it's a Hawaiian word for elder,</v>

589
00:21:38.987 --> 00:21:41.011
for spiritual elder.

590
00:21:41.011 --> 00:21:42.528
He's a spiritual, I'm,

591
00:21:42.528 --> 00:21:44.414
that happened really quickly.

592
00:21:44.414 --> 00:21:46.530
I was with another friend of mine,

593
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:49.684
was doing a journey on the Big Island in Hawaii,

594
00:21:49.684 --> 00:21:51.500
and he asked me to come do speaking for him,

595
00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.204
and I did, and when I was standing there,

596
00:21:54.204 --> 00:21:57.068
with this, probably a hundred people in this fold,

597
00:21:57.068 --> 00:22:00.380
and these two Hawaiian males came into this journey,

598
00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.542
come into this auditorium, right,

599
00:22:02.542 --> 00:22:06.825
and they said, "We're looking for the minister Fred."

600
00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:08.477
And so the guy said, "Well, that's him,"

601
00:22:08.477 --> 00:22:09.989
and he said, "Okay," so he comes in.

602
00:22:09.989 --> 00:22:11.144
They said, "We're gonna do this.

603
00:22:11.144 --> 00:22:12.594
"We're gonna do it right here in front of everybody."

604
00:22:12.594 --> 00:22:14.792
Now I had no idea it was coming.

605
00:22:15.932 --> 00:22:18.230
Not slight of idea did I have.

606
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.103
And they said, "We're gonna

607
00:22:20.103 --> 00:22:22.969
"make you a Kahu for the community."

608
00:22:22.969 --> 00:22:24.257
And I went, "Okay."

609
00:22:24.257 --> 00:22:25.774
I didn't know what a Kahu meant,

610
00:22:25.774 --> 00:22:27.315
but I said it's all right, because these are,

611
00:22:27.315 --> 00:22:30.190
they're dressed with head banners,

612
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:31.386
and all the--

613
00:22:31.386 --> 00:22:33.083
<v Host>Oh, and this is very serious.</v>

614
00:22:33.083 --> 00:22:34.469
The family traditions,
<v Kahu>Oh, very serious.</v>

615
00:22:34.469 --> 00:22:35.620
<v Host>thousands of years' traditions.</v>

616
00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.805
<v ->That's right, and they did this whole prayer thing,</v>

617
00:22:37.805 --> 00:22:40.655
and made me a Kahuna.

618
00:22:41.761 --> 00:22:43.603
Kahu, I'm sorry, Kahu.

619
00:22:43.603 --> 00:22:46.707
And a Kahu is very powerful

620
00:22:46.707 --> 00:22:48.433
to the Hawaiian people.

621
00:22:48.433 --> 00:22:49.330
It's very powerful.

622
00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.032
You have to have done something,

623
00:22:51.032 --> 00:22:53.907
and I didn't even have the time to ask these people

624
00:22:53.907 --> 00:22:56.321
what I had done, because when they finished,

625
00:22:56.321 --> 00:22:58.966
they walked out and I've never seen 'em since.

626
00:22:58.966 --> 00:22:59.957
Never heard from 'em since.

627
00:22:59.957 --> 00:23:01.336
Luckily I had a lot of people there

628
00:23:01.336 --> 00:23:03.292
witnessing this whole thing, because

629
00:23:03.292 --> 00:23:05.487
that's the only reason that I have,

630
00:23:05.487 --> 00:23:07.983
you ask me today, do you call me Fred or Kahu.

631
00:23:07.983 --> 00:23:10.606
I prefer Kahu because that's really my name now.

632
00:23:10.606 --> 00:23:12.101
You know, everybody knows me as Kahu,

633
00:23:12.101 --> 00:23:14.516
and if people call me Fred, I don't know

634
00:23:14.516 --> 00:23:16.585
who they're talking about for the most part.

635
00:23:16.585 --> 00:23:18.909
But that was fascinating.

636
00:23:18.909 --> 00:23:20.220
<v Host>That is fascinating.</v>

637
00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:23.048
Now, let's start moving into some of what

638
00:23:23.048 --> 00:23:25.463
comes through in contemporary themes.

639
00:23:25.463 --> 00:23:27.143
A lot's happened, a lot of information.

640
00:23:27.143 --> 00:23:28.914
People can go to your site and just,

641
00:23:28.914 --> 00:23:30.685
just massive amounts of information,

642
00:23:30.685 --> 00:23:32.708
and audio files and so forth there,

643
00:23:32.708 --> 00:23:34.435
on a myriad of subjects, but

644
00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.998
we'll start at an obvious place.

645
00:23:37.998 --> 00:23:39.268
The election just took place.

646
00:23:39.268 --> 00:23:40.256
<v ->It did, yes it did.</v>

647
00:23:40.256 --> 00:23:43.131
<v Host>We have president-elect Barack Obama.</v>

648
00:23:43.131 --> 00:23:45.087
I know that you had a lengthy channeling session

649
00:23:45.087 --> 00:23:47.755
just yesterday, and there's a lot of information

650
00:23:47.755 --> 00:23:50.376
coming through from your guide, Kirael

651
00:23:50.376 --> 00:23:51.320
about all of this.

652
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.125
Can you tell us the essence

653
00:23:54.125 --> 00:23:56.632
of what has come through regarding,

654
00:23:56.632 --> 00:23:59.071
regarding this turn of events, politically?

655
00:23:59.071 --> 00:24:01.600
<v ->I want to say this very clearly.</v>

656
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.890
I'm not suggesting that he's going to be

657
00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:06.729
disrupted or anything along those lines.

658
00:24:06.729 --> 00:24:09.398
I'm not suggesting that yet.

659
00:24:09.398 --> 00:24:11.284
It could happen, because,

660
00:24:11.284 --> 00:24:13.308
let's face it, he's the first black president,

661
00:24:13.308 --> 00:24:15.493
and he's a beautiful, beautiful being,

662
00:24:15.493 --> 00:24:19.127
and but I'll tell you what Master Kirael is saying, he says,

663
00:24:19.127 --> 00:24:21.841
they're gonna take shots at him, very quickly.

664
00:24:21.841 --> 00:24:23.106
The honeymoon's gonna be over

665
00:24:23.106 --> 00:24:24.854
quicker than you can imagine.

666
00:24:24.854 --> 00:24:28.119
And I can feel it already,

667
00:24:28.119 --> 00:24:31.685
but they're saying that, what Master Kirael is saying,

668
00:24:31.685 --> 00:24:34.191
and I say Master Kirael because he is such a master,

669
00:24:34.191 --> 00:24:38.033
but he's saying if we would just

670
00:24:38.033 --> 00:24:39.665
be We the People,

671
00:24:39.665 --> 00:24:43.346
this is our first chance forever, for ever time,

672
00:24:43.346 --> 00:24:46.337
to be the We the People that we know we've got to be.

673
00:24:46.337 --> 00:24:48.314
We the People is gonna go through the shift.

674
00:24:48.314 --> 00:24:50.500
We the People are gonna have to be ready there,

675
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.476
and do those things, but right now

676
00:24:52.476 --> 00:24:54.915
is our opportunity to back this president

677
00:24:54.915 --> 00:24:56.685
as far as we can back him,

678
00:24:56.685 --> 00:24:59.837
and anything that he does that makes sense to us,

679
00:24:59.837 --> 00:25:02.161
if he doesn't make sense then we've got to call him

680
00:25:02.161 --> 00:25:04.850
right there and call him right on that time,

681
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:05.841
at that time.

682
00:25:05.841 --> 00:25:07.749
Because we're gonna back him

683
00:25:07.749 --> 00:25:11.153
as long as he's doing everything to move us forward.

684
00:25:11.153 --> 00:25:13.112
You know, we've come in,

685
00:25:13.112 --> 00:25:14.629
I'm not a Republican or a Democratic,

686
00:25:14.629 --> 00:25:16.054
or an Independent, I'm not anything.

687
00:25:16.054 --> 00:25:18.172
I'm just a person who goes and votes.

688
00:25:18.172 --> 00:25:19.898
I vote for who I want to vote for.

689
00:25:19.898 --> 00:25:23.347
But what we've learned is that

690
00:25:23.347 --> 00:25:26.751
the last eight years has been at least tenuous,

691
00:25:26.751 --> 00:25:28.569
I mean it's been tough.

692
00:25:28.569 --> 00:25:30.891
Let's be fair first, it's been tough.

693
00:25:30.891 --> 00:25:33.215
We have two wars, we have

694
00:25:33.215 --> 00:25:36.048
economies crashings, everything going wrong.

695
00:25:36.048 --> 00:25:38.624
We've got three million people out of a job

696
00:25:38.624 --> 00:25:40.142
in the United States?

697
00:25:40.142 --> 00:25:41.176
I traveled around the country.

698
00:25:41.176 --> 00:25:44.672
I've traveled to Russia, Austria,

699
00:25:44.672 --> 00:25:45.986
Japan
<v Host>Yeah, thousands</v>

700
00:25:45.986 --> 00:25:49.044
of people that gather to hear what you have to say,

701
00:25:49.044 --> 00:25:50.379
and Kirael has to say.

702
00:25:50.379 --> 00:25:52.794
<v ->And I've heard all this stuff, I've heard from,</v>

703
00:25:52.794 --> 00:25:55.760
in fact my first trip to Russia

704
00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.556
was very frightening for me, because

705
00:25:57.556 --> 00:25:59.212
I can only imagine,

706
00:25:59.212 --> 00:26:01.696
I grew up at the time where Russia was a big deal,

707
00:26:02.836 --> 00:26:04.645
so I was a little tentative to go there,

708
00:26:04.645 --> 00:26:08.049
but I went there anyway, and the people are so powerful.

709
00:26:08.049 --> 00:26:10.051
I don't know if you reached Russia,

710
00:26:10.051 --> 00:26:11.705
but you probably should, because

711
00:26:11.705 --> 00:26:14.028
if you're doin' this type of interview,

712
00:26:14.028 --> 00:26:16.720
because these people, they would eat you up.

713
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.583
You know, they would just, like a candy cane,

714
00:26:18.583 --> 00:26:19.595
they'd eat you up.

715
00:26:19.595 --> 00:26:20.676
You know what I'm sayin'?

716
00:26:20.676 --> 00:26:22.745
Because their whole journey is they gotta put on

717
00:26:22.745 --> 00:26:25.344
this huge front of everything.

718
00:26:25.344 --> 00:26:26.448
The women are just,

719
00:26:26.448 --> 00:26:27.668
if you get in an elevator,

720
00:26:27.668 --> 00:26:30.289
and there's three women and two men, or whatever,

721
00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:32.567
the women will stare at you,

722
00:26:32.567 --> 00:26:35.234
and glow at you, and oh my god.

723
00:26:35.234 --> 00:26:37.462
I'm gonna talk to these people?

724
00:26:37.462 --> 00:26:38.523
I'm gonna go back home right now,

725
00:26:38.523 --> 00:26:39.973
and forget this whole journey.

726
00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:42.284
But when they come into the room,

727
00:26:42.284 --> 00:26:44.055
and they come in, they're so sweet,

728
00:26:44.055 --> 00:26:46.172
and soft and gently.

729
00:26:46.172 --> 00:26:47.989
I mean my god, they're such,

730
00:26:47.989 --> 00:26:49.970
I mean, they're just unbelievable.

731
00:26:51.579 --> 00:26:53.930
The whole journey is with Master Kirael,

732
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:56.482
he said with what I was trying to get to,

733
00:26:56.482 --> 00:26:58.666
allude to with this thing with Russia thing,

734
00:26:58.666 --> 00:27:01.013
these people are hungry.

735
00:27:01.013 --> 00:27:03.842
They want to be with Master Kirael, with me,

736
00:27:03.842 --> 00:27:05.935
with Kryon, with all these people.

737
00:27:05.935 --> 00:27:07.199
They want to be there.

738
00:27:07.199 --> 00:27:08.396
They really want to be there.

739
00:27:08.396 --> 00:27:09.086
<v Host>They want knowledge</v>

740
00:27:09.086 --> 00:27:11.109
and upliftment, and inspriation.

741
00:27:11.109 --> 00:27:11.962
<v ->They've heard of it,</v>

742
00:27:11.962 --> 00:27:13.202
but now they wanted to see it.

743
00:27:13.202 --> 00:27:14.192
They wanted to, you know,

744
00:27:14.192 --> 00:27:17.112
they've only heard the cusps of this whole thing.

745
00:27:17.112 --> 00:27:18.608
Now they can be there.

746
00:27:18.608 --> 00:27:21.396
Anyway, this whole journey was about

747
00:27:21.396 --> 00:27:25.010
this whole unfolding, this whole journey with Master Kirael,

748
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:29.172
he said when we talk about Barack Obama,

749
00:27:29.172 --> 00:27:33.611
he says he's never said anything negative or anything,

750
00:27:33.611 --> 00:27:37.522
he's just simply saying, "We've got to be We the People."

751
00:27:37.522 --> 00:27:38.833
We've got to be the We the People,

752
00:27:38.833 --> 00:27:41.846
and We the People, and that's what I am trying to be.

753
00:27:41.846 --> 00:27:45.240
I'll always try to be Master Kirael, with Master Kirael,

754
00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.118
and he's not a We the People,

755
00:27:47.118 --> 00:27:48.659
he's not even a person, right.

756
00:27:48.659 --> 00:27:52.384
But he's just powerful being, that everybody loves him,

757
00:27:52.384 --> 00:27:54.500
and I say that without any hesitation.

758
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.111
I'm sure there's people that don't love him,

759
00:27:56.111 --> 00:27:58.014
but I've never heard 'em.

760
00:27:58.014 --> 00:28:01.218
But he's so powerful, what he's saying.

761
00:28:01.218 --> 00:28:04.208
He's saying that we've got to stand up for him,

762
00:28:04.208 --> 00:28:05.864
because he's just one man.

763
00:28:05.864 --> 00:28:06.646
<v Host>You're talking about</v>

764
00:28:06.646 --> 00:28:07.453
for Barack.
<v Kahu>Barack, yes,</v>

765
00:28:07.453 --> 00:28:09.023
that's right, he's just the one man.

766
00:28:09.023 --> 00:28:10.884
And he's not gonna do that much.

767
00:28:10.884 --> 00:28:12.931
That's not gonna make my friends out there happy,

768
00:28:12.931 --> 00:28:15.047
but he's not gonna do that much for,

769
00:28:15.047 --> 00:28:16.473
but he's gonna open up the door for you

770
00:28:16.473 --> 00:28:17.554
and I to do it.

771
00:28:17.554 --> 00:28:19.445
<v Host>Because the spirit has been ignited,</v>

772
00:28:19.445 --> 00:28:21.213
the spirit for change has been ignited.

773
00:28:21.213 --> 00:28:22.271
<v ->That's exactly right.</v>

774
00:28:22.271 --> 00:28:24.594
<v Host>For better or for worst, it's been fueled,</v>

775
00:28:24.594 --> 00:28:26.089
the grid's been fueled for change.

776
00:28:26.089 --> 00:28:26.963
<v ->That's right.</v>

777
00:28:26.963 --> 00:28:28.320
<v Host>So now, this is a</v>

778
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.644
tremendous amount of pressure on one human being

779
00:28:30.644 --> 00:28:33.081
who has some very powerful alliances.

780
00:28:33.081 --> 00:28:36.190
One can talk about, that's a whole other discussion.

781
00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.488
The reality is he's walking among lions,

782
00:28:38.488 --> 00:28:40.444
he's placed himself among lions,

783
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:44.104
and it's up for debate as to whether he believes

784
00:28:44.104 --> 00:28:45.875
he can carry out this agenda,

785
00:28:45.875 --> 00:28:48.699
or whether he's going to carry out their agendas.

786
00:28:48.699 --> 00:28:50.799
But it's up to us.

787
00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:53.249
And how does this look to you

788
00:28:53.249 --> 00:28:55.189
when Kirael's talking about this,

789
00:28:55.189 --> 00:28:57.107
what's it feel like, We the People.

790
00:28:57.107 --> 00:28:58.703
<v ->It feels, I don't know,</v>

791
00:28:58.703 --> 00:29:00.190
I never heard him talk.

792
00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:03.485
But I haven't even, I didn't even listen to his tapes.

793
00:29:03.485 --> 00:29:04.195
I'm sorry.

794
00:29:04.195 --> 00:29:06.355
<v Host>Well, from what other people have reflected back</v>

795
00:29:06.355 --> 00:29:07.507
<v ->They reflect back to me,</v>

796
00:29:07.507 --> 00:29:09.814
it makes me very proud of what he's saying,

797
00:29:09.814 --> 00:29:11.906
because he's saying that We the People

798
00:29:11.906 --> 00:29:14.989
can carry this luggage that he's gonna hand off to us.

799
00:29:14.989 --> 00:29:16.967
Well you say, or anybody says,

800
00:29:16.967 --> 00:29:19.017
maybe he's gonna go this way, he's gonna go that way,

801
00:29:19.017 --> 00:29:22.442
doesn't matter because by that time, We the People,

802
00:29:22.442 --> 00:29:24.720
if we have just the courage to go there.

803
00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.145
That's the first thing.

804
00:29:26.145 --> 00:29:27.778
And everybody that's gonna listen to this interview,

805
00:29:27.778 --> 00:29:30.010
say who am I to say whether courage or not.

806
00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:30.842
I don't know.

807
00:29:30.842 --> 00:29:34.522
I do know that I feel so positive

808
00:29:34.522 --> 00:29:37.489
when I think about us taking the reins,

809
00:29:37.489 --> 00:29:39.422
even away from him if necessary.

810
00:29:39.422 --> 00:29:42.066
We've got to be there right now.

811
00:29:42.066 --> 00:29:43.308
That's all we can do.

812
00:29:43.308 --> 00:29:45.586
<v Host>I think this is so right on.</v>

813
00:29:45.586 --> 00:29:49.243
I've done a couple of deep inquiring meditations on it

814
00:29:49.243 --> 00:29:51.704
and I keep seeing the exact same thing.

815
00:29:51.704 --> 00:29:54.601
It's We the People, it's about bringing back

816
00:29:54.601 --> 00:29:57.592
the notion of liberty and justice for all.

817
00:29:57.592 --> 00:30:00.374
And the United States must recover itself.

818
00:30:00.374 --> 00:30:04.538
It's too much of a pivotal point in global everything

819
00:30:04.538 --> 00:30:06.676
to not recover itself.

820
00:30:06.676 --> 00:30:08.540
So this is a big time for We the People.

821
00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.633
<v ->Well, I think whatever you say right now, because</v>

822
00:30:10.633 --> 00:30:14.152
our economics are so despairing, actually,

823
00:30:14.152 --> 00:30:17.096
but you know, you've got to look around the world.

824
00:30:17.096 --> 00:30:18.222
When we've had these problems

825
00:30:18.222 --> 00:30:20.591
with our economic problems,

826
00:30:20.591 --> 00:30:22.202
what has the rest of the world done?

827
00:30:22.202 --> 00:30:24.846
Did they climb up and stand on top of us?

828
00:30:24.846 --> 00:30:26.525
No, they went down below us.

829
00:30:26.525 --> 00:30:27.377
<v Host>I know, it's not good.</v>

830
00:30:27.377 --> 00:30:29.170
<v ->The nikon went down,</v>

831
00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:31.955
the European went down, everything went down,

832
00:30:31.955 --> 00:30:33.336
and that was their chance.

833
00:30:33.336 --> 00:30:34.808
If they really wanted to,

834
00:30:34.808 --> 00:30:37.039
they wanted to grow above us and America,

835
00:30:37.039 --> 00:30:38.166
which I don't know why they'd want to be

836
00:30:38.166 --> 00:30:40.287
anything above us, because

837
00:30:40.287 --> 00:30:42.307
they've got their own problems.

838
00:30:42.307 --> 00:30:46.241
This gentleman, Putin, the Russian Prime Minister,

839
00:30:46.241 --> 00:30:49.162
he was saying that here's my gift for you.

840
00:30:49.162 --> 00:30:52.312
I'm gonna put some missiles on the Polish border.

841
00:30:52.312 --> 00:30:54.681
And Master Kirael simply said

842
00:30:54.681 --> 00:30:57.534
tell him right, tell the people when you go to Russia,

843
00:30:57.534 --> 00:31:00.109
tell him take 'em off.

844
00:31:00.109 --> 00:31:03.927
Don't talk to Putin, 'cause he's just a figurehead,

845
00:31:03.927 --> 00:31:06.573
from some outside force what you wanna call it,

846
00:31:06.573 --> 00:31:08.619
the secret government or whatever, you know,

847
00:31:08.619 --> 00:31:10.780
you can come up with all the titles you want.

848
00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.109
But the point is that We the People

849
00:31:13.109 --> 00:31:17.058
can overpower them right now, if, through,

850
00:31:17.058 --> 00:31:18.908
ah, this is gonna be so embarrassing but,

851
00:31:18.908 --> 00:31:20.680
it's too about being in love.

852
00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.387
Love, love and more love,

853
00:31:22.387 --> 00:31:25.262
because if we just find this journey and stay in love,

854
00:31:25.262 --> 00:31:26.572
we're gonna come through this whole journey

855
00:31:26.572 --> 00:31:28.207
with smiles on our faces.

856
00:31:28.207 --> 00:31:29.701
Because we're gonna go into this thing

857
00:31:29.701 --> 00:31:31.495
called a great shift, and I want you

858
00:31:31.495 --> 00:31:34.277
to hear me say this lass, because,

859
00:31:34.277 --> 00:31:36.117
I just called you lass, that's so funny.

860
00:31:36.117 --> 00:31:38.142
That's what Master Kirael calls everybody, lass.

861
00:31:38.142 --> 00:31:39.590
<v Host>Oh, (chuckles)</v>

862
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:40.833
You can call me lass.

863
00:31:40.833 --> 00:31:43.063
<v ->(stammers) Wow, anyway,</v>

864
00:31:43.063 --> 00:31:44.919
this whole journey is about,

865
00:31:44.919 --> 00:31:47.173
we're gonna have to do something right about now,

866
00:31:47.173 --> 00:31:48.807
right about now, like today,

867
00:31:48.807 --> 00:31:50.301
like I'm doing this interview.

868
00:31:50.301 --> 00:31:51.958
I didn't know we were going to talk about this today,

869
00:31:51.958 --> 00:31:53.820
and I hopefully, this'll get out to the people

870
00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.339
you want to get it out to,

871
00:31:55.339 --> 00:31:57.985
because they can hear it and if we got

872
00:31:57.985 --> 00:32:00.076
two people, or a hundred people, or a thousand people,

873
00:32:00.076 --> 00:32:02.767
I don't know, if we get somebody to start think with us,

874
00:32:02.767 --> 00:32:04.643
we could, I don't want to come back in,

875
00:32:04.643 --> 00:32:06.455
you know, they can go to my site and they can hear

876
00:32:06.455 --> 00:32:07.627
all the free things.

877
00:32:07.627 --> 00:32:10.159
We've got so many free things on the site it's unbelievable.

878
00:32:10.159 --> 00:32:12.642
But if they just hear what I'm saying right here,

879
00:32:12.642 --> 00:32:14.021
and they go tell their friends.

880
00:32:14.021 --> 00:32:16.184
Don't tell 'em that a Master Guide tell 'em,

881
00:32:16.184 --> 00:32:17.382
I didn't tell 'em.

882
00:32:17.382 --> 00:32:19.772
They just had this idea that We the People

883
00:32:19.772 --> 00:32:22.577
have got to do something to change our life

884
00:32:22.577 --> 00:32:23.497
for a better place.

885
00:32:23.497 --> 00:32:24.164
<v Host>We do indeed.</v>

886
00:32:24.164 --> 00:32:25.890
I just interviewed Naomi Wolf,

887
00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:28.281
an author who wrote the book, Give Me Liberty,

888
00:32:28.281 --> 00:32:31.754
and every one of us is getting the same message.

889
00:32:31.754 --> 00:32:33.387
We the People have to stand up.

890
00:32:33.387 --> 00:32:33.985
<v ->That's great.</v>

891
00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:34.997
<v Host>And make ourselves known,</v>

892
00:32:34.997 --> 00:32:36.446
and make our desires known,

893
00:32:36.446 --> 00:32:39.114
and this point that you say is so true, because

894
00:32:40.414 --> 00:32:42.521
there's activism as one thing.

895
00:32:42.521 --> 00:32:45.603
However, to actually shift the frequencies

896
00:32:45.603 --> 00:32:47.996
of this grid takes the love.

897
00:32:47.996 --> 00:32:50.480
<v ->Yeah, 'cause it's gonna shift with our without us.</v>

898
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.891
<v Host>Right, right.</v>
(Kahu laughs)

899
00:32:53.891 --> 00:32:55.101
Do you want to talk about,

900
00:32:55.101 --> 00:32:56.631
I mean 2012's everywhere,

901
00:32:56.631 --> 00:32:59.301
we've been to a 2012 conference recently,

902
00:32:59.301 --> 00:33:01.530
so 2012, it means a lot of things to a lot of people,

903
00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:02.496
but one thing's for sure.

904
00:33:02.496 --> 00:33:03.813
We're in a time of change.

905
00:33:05.883 --> 00:33:08.221
How have you and Kirael,

906
00:33:08.221 --> 00:33:09.588
how have you through Kirael

907
00:33:10.783 --> 00:33:12.835
witnessed or seen what's coming up?

908
00:33:12.835 --> 00:33:13.701
What's it look like?

909
00:33:13.701 --> 00:33:15.318
<v ->I'll share it with you right now.</v>

910
00:33:15.318 --> 00:33:19.251
October 18, 2006

911
00:33:19.251 --> 00:33:21.299
I was coming home from work,

912
00:33:21.299 --> 00:33:23.927
from the healing center, from the church,

913
00:33:23.927 --> 00:33:25.583
and I called my wife, I said, "What do you want for dinner?"

914
00:33:25.583 --> 00:33:27.902
And she told and I picked it up at Zippy's

915
00:33:27.902 --> 00:33:30.536
and got home, I walked in the den,

916
00:33:30.536 --> 00:33:32.375
I put it on the dinner table,

917
00:33:32.375 --> 00:33:35.963
and I went into my den room just to change my clothes,

918
00:33:35.963 --> 00:33:39.322
and I had what you'd call a massive stroke.

919
00:33:39.322 --> 00:33:42.262
I mean I just went down, phew, boing.

920
00:33:42.262 --> 00:33:43.878
Woke up in the hospital.

921
00:33:43.878 --> 00:33:45.672
I didn't wake up in the hospital,

922
00:33:45.672 --> 00:33:48.803
I woke up inside the hospital because I was up here,

923
00:33:48.803 --> 00:33:52.643
over my bed looking down at this, at my body,

924
00:33:52.643 --> 00:33:54.852
and I'm thinking, well that looks really gross,

925
00:33:54.852 --> 00:33:57.359
because my face was all drawn, and my,

926
00:33:57.359 --> 00:33:58.876
you know, the two doctors were standing

927
00:33:58.876 --> 00:34:00.693
at the end of the bed, and

928
00:34:00.693 --> 00:34:02.188
a female doctor and a male doctor,

929
00:34:02.188 --> 00:34:05.604
and the female is trying to show her presence.

930
00:34:05.604 --> 00:34:08.305
And she's very boldly telling this doctor,

931
00:34:08.305 --> 00:34:10.407
"Oh, this is just your typical stroke.

932
00:34:10.407 --> 00:34:11.918
"He's never gonna use his right leg,

933
00:34:11.918 --> 00:34:13.644
"and he's gonna use his right arm,

934
00:34:13.644 --> 00:34:15.598
"and his face is gonna be frozen,

935
00:34:15.598 --> 00:34:17.279
"and he's never gonna have a spetch, because

936
00:34:17.279 --> 00:34:19.096
it's all in the left brain.
<v Host>Your speech, right,</v>

937
00:34:19.096 --> 00:34:21.051
and now you are witnessing this from above.

938
00:34:21.051 --> 00:34:22.178
<v ->Oh, yeah, yeah.</v>

939
00:34:22.178 --> 00:34:24.914
And I think, so I, (stammers)

940
00:34:24.914 --> 00:34:25.729
"I don't want to do that.

941
00:34:25.729 --> 00:34:28.021
"I don't want to go back in that, because,

942
00:34:28.021 --> 00:34:30.009
"I'm just gonna get out, because,"

943
00:34:30.009 --> 00:34:33.181
(stammers) I don't want to say I was dead,

944
00:34:33.181 --> 00:34:34.135
I don't know what I was doing up there,

945
00:34:34.135 --> 00:34:36.730
but I was up there, so that's all I knew,

946
00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:40.255
but I decided that I was gonna go home right now,

947
00:34:40.255 --> 00:34:41.979
I was gonna go home.

948
00:34:41.979 --> 00:34:43.980
And I heard this beautiful Scottish voice,

949
00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:45.406
what I should never hear.

950
00:34:45.406 --> 00:34:48.126
He said, '"Breathe, laddie, breathe."

951
00:34:48.126 --> 00:34:50.566
And I said, "Okay, I'm going to breathe.

952
00:34:50.566 --> 00:34:51.624
"What are we going to breathe for?"

953
00:34:51.624 --> 00:34:53.487
And I took that first part of breath,

954
00:34:53.487 --> 00:34:56.017
and it came into me, my whole body,

955
00:34:56.017 --> 00:34:58.547
my body just shivered and I was in,

956
00:34:58.547 --> 00:34:59.950
back in the body.

957
00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:02.042
Just like that, boom, I was back in the body,

958
00:35:02.042 --> 00:35:04.409
and thinking oh my god, what have I done?

959
00:35:04.409 --> 00:35:05.631
This is crazy.

960
00:35:05.631 --> 00:35:09.632
But it's too long of a story to tell you, but

961
00:35:09.632 --> 00:35:11.863
I'll tell you this whole journey,

962
00:35:11.863 --> 00:35:13.887
I worked very hard with my breathing.

963
00:35:13.887 --> 00:35:16.418
I was so breathing so loudly that the nurses

964
00:35:16.418 --> 00:35:19.338
came out of the nurse station and come over to look at me,

965
00:35:19.338 --> 00:35:20.397
say, "What is he doing?"

966
00:35:20.397 --> 00:35:21.937
And they looked for a couple of times,

967
00:35:21.937 --> 00:35:23.708
and they just, "Well, he's not gonna hurt anything,

968
00:35:23.708 --> 00:35:25.044
"so let him go."

969
00:35:25.044 --> 00:35:27.688
And I kept doing, and I kept going and going,

970
00:35:27.688 --> 00:35:30.470
and I finally got my toes and my feet,

971
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:32.771
I pulled it up, my right leg.

972
00:35:32.771 --> 00:35:35.024
I said, "That's not true."

973
00:35:35.024 --> 00:35:38.015
"What they said is not the truth that I understand to be,

974
00:35:38.015 --> 00:35:40.406
"because that means I'm gonna walk out of this."

975
00:35:40.406 --> 00:35:44.328
Three days, I got up and walked out of the hospital.

976
00:35:44.328 --> 00:35:45.683
<v Host>I thought that would be amazing.</v>

977
00:35:45.683 --> 00:35:47.444
<v Kahu>It's amazing.</v>
It's amazing.

978
00:35:47.444 --> 00:35:50.108
<v Kahu>And I think that, I don't tell anybody this,</v>

979
00:35:50.108 --> 00:35:53.172
because I don't want to hear my story,

980
00:35:53.172 --> 00:35:55.312
but when I think about,

981
00:35:55.312 --> 00:35:57.612
when I started with Master Kirael 20 years ago,

982
00:35:57.612 --> 00:36:00.440
20 years ago he said, "You're gonna have experience

983
00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.165
"of three days of darkness."

984
00:36:02.165 --> 00:36:03.805
And I said, "What are the three days of darkness?'

985
00:36:03.805 --> 00:36:05.438
And we've talked about it over years,

986
00:36:05.438 --> 00:36:07.012
years I've turned on this.
<v Host>This is what comes up</v>

987
00:36:07.012 --> 00:36:09.441
in all the texts and biblically and otherwise

988
00:36:09.441 --> 00:36:11.366
about the days of darkness.

989
00:36:11.366 --> 00:36:13.169
<v ->And Master Kirael told me,</v>

990
00:36:13.169 --> 00:36:16.160
my first session back, he told,

991
00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.034
I think my wife told me that,

992
00:36:19.034 --> 00:36:21.634
Just tell the Kahu this, she said.

993
00:36:21.634 --> 00:36:23.843
"He's had his three days of darkness.

994
00:36:23.843 --> 00:36:26.327
"He's not gonna have another three days."

995
00:36:26.327 --> 00:36:28.790
Well that's good, is that good, or is that not good?

996
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:30.906
I'm not sure, you know. (laughs)

997
00:36:30.906 --> 00:36:32.515
But it really was my three days of darkness,

998
00:36:32.515 --> 00:36:34.033
'cause I had nothing in that period.

999
00:36:34.033 --> 00:36:36.748
I had periods where I'd waken, go back out,

1000
00:36:36.748 --> 00:36:39.461
and back up, that's all I had, but

1001
00:36:39.461 --> 00:36:41.164
it was really my three days of darkness.

1002
00:36:41.164 --> 00:36:44.362
You have, you stated you're knowing that you'd be

1003
00:36:44.362 --> 00:36:45.582
laying in a field,

1004
00:36:45.582 --> 00:36:48.275
and feeling nauseous, and so on and so forth.

1005
00:36:48.275 --> 00:36:50.139
<v Host>Trying to, just lying on my back on the ground</v>

1006
00:36:50.139 --> 00:36:53.335
to stay grounded, so to speak.

1007
00:36:53.335 --> 00:36:55.659
Because of disorient, I see that period

1008
00:36:55.659 --> 00:36:58.464
as disorientation and lots of nausea.

1009
00:36:58.464 --> 00:37:01.337
<v ->See, when you get to my age, or worse,</v>

1010
00:37:01.337 --> 00:37:04.612
we have problems with our pelvic systems

1011
00:37:04.612 --> 00:37:06.682
and our brains and everything.

1012
00:37:06.682 --> 00:37:09.005
I tell you this, this has been such a fortune

1013
00:37:09.005 --> 00:37:11.836
for me to go through this whole journey.

1014
00:37:11.836 --> 00:37:14.879
You know, when I came out of the hospital that first day,

1015
00:37:14.879 --> 00:37:17.198
told my wife what I wanted for dinner,

1016
00:37:17.198 --> 00:37:20.437
and I said, (mumbles incoherently).

1017
00:37:20.437 --> 00:37:22.443
That's all I could speak, nothing.

1018
00:37:22.443 --> 00:37:23.547
So I had to write it down.

1019
00:37:23.547 --> 00:37:26.997
And I can't write, because it was my right was gone, right.

1020
00:37:26.997 --> 00:37:30.081
Anyway, so I just got a peanut butter and jelly sandwich

1021
00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:31.784
or something, I think, I don't know what it was,

1022
00:37:31.784 --> 00:37:33.899
but I got it from her and that was the end of the journey.

1023
00:37:35.229 --> 00:37:37.400
But what I'm trying to say to you is that

1024
00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.863
it was so prevalent for me to go through

1025
00:37:39.863 --> 00:37:43.703
this whole journey to be aware of what we're gonna do

1026
00:37:43.703 --> 00:37:46.509
right now, right in that timespace.

1027
00:37:46.509 --> 00:37:48.607
So if Master Kirael was telling the truth,

1028
00:37:48.607 --> 00:37:50.193
which he's

1029
00:37:50.193 --> 00:37:50.907
<v Host>Prone to do?</v>

1030
00:37:50.907 --> 00:37:52.585
<v ->Prone to be, thank you, thank you.</v>

1031
00:37:52.585 --> 00:37:54.954
But he really is prone to this thing called truth.

1032
00:37:54.954 --> 00:37:57.861
And he said that I've had my three days of darkness,

1033
00:37:57.861 --> 00:37:59.816
which means that when I get to this point.

1034
00:37:59.816 --> 00:38:01.311
You know, we have little things in our bodies

1035
00:38:01.311 --> 00:38:02.416
that we never recognize.

1036
00:38:02.416 --> 00:38:03.932
In my healing, I talk about 'em.

1037
00:38:03.932 --> 00:38:07.498
We have the cells, 70 trillion cells in this body.

1038
00:38:07.498 --> 00:38:10.534
All of this has a part of a mind, a part of this whole mind,

1039
00:38:10.534 --> 00:38:12.143
this whole journey is right there.

1040
00:38:12.143 --> 00:38:13.366
Inside these little cell have

1041
00:38:13.366 --> 00:38:15.390
a little thing called a mitochondria.

1042
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:17.506
It's called the starter cell.

1043
00:38:17.506 --> 00:38:20.472
It's what keeps the cell, actually it's oxygenation

1044
00:38:20.472 --> 00:38:21.485
for the cells, right?

1045
00:38:22.727 --> 00:38:25.354
What I discovered was is that we also have

1046
00:38:25.354 --> 00:38:26.780
stem cells.

1047
00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:27.998
Stem cells?

1048
00:38:29.118 --> 00:38:32.001
It's a hard subject for me to broach, because

1049
00:38:32.001 --> 00:38:33.690
I don't have time to go into any great detail,

1050
00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:36.292
but we have stem cells in our brain,

1051
00:38:36.292 --> 00:38:39.829
in our brain, we have stem cells in our liver,

1052
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:41.718
not just the stem cells from a,

1053
00:38:43.429 --> 00:38:44.665
the baby thing, right?

1054
00:38:44.665 --> 00:38:46.021
<v Host>The fetus, yeah.</v>
That's right.

1055
00:38:46.021 --> 00:38:48.344
<v Kahu>We've got stem cells in our brain.</v>

1056
00:38:48.344 --> 00:38:51.036
So I'm drawing the stem cells.

1057
00:38:51.036 --> 00:38:52.715
What I've done, that's why,

1058
00:38:52.715 --> 00:38:54.632
you didn't even know I had stroke, right?

1059
00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:55.165
Well.

1060
00:38:55.165 --> 00:38:56.103
<v Host>I knew something had happened to you</v>

1061
00:38:56.103 --> 00:38:58.634
'cause I had read, but I didn't know it was a stroke.

1062
00:38:58.634 --> 00:38:59.849
And you certainly don't
<v Kahu>A massive stroke.</v>

1063
00:38:59.849 --> 00:39:01.057
<v Host>appear to have any symptoms</v>

1064
00:39:01.057 --> 00:39:04.256
of having had a stroke two years ago.

1065
00:39:04.256 --> 00:39:05.107
<v ->Thank you very much.</v>

1066
00:39:05.107 --> 00:39:06.832
I really appreciate to hear.

1067
00:39:06.832 --> 00:39:10.030
I know how different I am, but that's all right, thank you.

1068
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:12.007
This whole journey was about

1069
00:39:12.007 --> 00:39:14.881
this stroke, I had to get these brain stems

1070
00:39:14.881 --> 00:39:16.086
down into my body.

1071
00:39:16.086 --> 00:39:19.467
So I had my son, 38-year-old son,

1072
00:39:19.467 --> 00:39:22.089
I was 12 when I had him.

1073
00:39:22.089 --> 00:39:23.607
No, just kidding.
(Host laughs)

1074
00:39:23.607 --> 00:39:25.448
I had a 38-year-old son that,

1075
00:39:25.448 --> 00:39:28.461
he's a healer and a minister at my church and everything,

1076
00:39:28.461 --> 00:39:31.519
and he'd come in and he'd do this healing,

1077
00:39:31.519 --> 00:39:34.482
and he'd come in and he'd work on my right side,

1078
00:39:34.482 --> 00:39:36.037
and the left side, 'cause the left side

1079
00:39:36.037 --> 00:39:37.255
there was nothin' here.

1080
00:39:37.255 --> 00:39:39.856
There's nothing gone, everything was all gone over here.

1081
00:39:39.856 --> 00:39:41.074
The only blood I was gettin' to my brain,

1082
00:39:41.074 --> 00:39:44.525
I had 18% going up to my brain.

1083
00:39:44.525 --> 00:39:47.101
18 out of a hundred percent, I had 18.

1084
00:39:47.101 --> 00:39:48.618
And the doctor was telling me

1085
00:39:48.618 --> 00:39:50.688
that I need to get this surgery done,

1086
00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:52.021
to put a stent.

1087
00:39:52.021 --> 00:39:53.312
Stent? (grimaces)

1088
00:39:53.312 --> 00:39:54.276
What's a stent?

1089
00:39:54.276 --> 00:39:56.208
Anyway, so I said, how long do I have?

1090
00:39:56.208 --> 00:39:57.473
And she said, "Well, you should do it today,

1091
00:39:57.473 --> 00:39:58.647
"but we can give you a couple of weeks."

1092
00:39:58.647 --> 00:40:00.463
And I said, "Good, couple of weeks."

1093
00:40:00.463 --> 00:40:03.039
Three weeks, I put it up to three weeks.

1094
00:40:03.039 --> 00:40:06.191
I went back in and had like 40% already open,

1095
00:40:06.191 --> 00:40:08.628
from 18 to 40%.

1096
00:40:08.628 --> 00:40:10.261
And she was just blown away.

1097
00:40:10.261 --> 00:40:11.918
She could not believe it.

1098
00:40:13.827 --> 00:40:15.073
The long story short, I come back

1099
00:40:15.073 --> 00:40:16.727
about a month, two months later,

1100
00:40:16.727 --> 00:40:18.820
and I had 50%.

1101
00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:21.465
And actually, I have veins now growing up

1102
00:40:21.465 --> 00:40:23.585
from my throat into my brain,

1103
00:40:24.777 --> 00:40:26.327
brand new veins that have grown up in there

1104
00:40:26.327 --> 00:40:27.708
to do this thing.

1105
00:40:27.708 --> 00:40:30.123
And that's not special, it's really not special,

1106
00:40:30.123 --> 00:40:31.755
'cause anybody can do this

1107
00:40:31.755 --> 00:40:34.377
if you have the courage and you have the know-how.

1108
00:40:34.377 --> 00:40:36.379
The doctor, any doctor,

1109
00:40:36.379 --> 00:40:37.966
any person that are going to my doctor,

1110
00:40:37.966 --> 00:40:39.920
she's a lovely, lovely lady.

1111
00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.877
But she just had her mind set

1112
00:40:41.877 --> 00:40:43.075
to put the stent in and go.

1113
00:40:43.075 --> 00:40:45.353
<v Host>Sure, that's what they're trained into, yeah.</v>

1114
00:40:45.353 --> 00:40:47.794
<v ->But if people would search out for what</v>

1115
00:40:47.794 --> 00:40:49.910
I call alternative medicine,

1116
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:51.911
it really is alternative, fully alternative.

1117
00:40:51.911 --> 00:40:54.096
<v Host>So you were able to get all this functioning back.</v>

1118
00:40:54.096 --> 00:40:56.695
And let's go back to how this ties in,

1119
00:40:56.695 --> 00:40:58.075
this three days of darkness,

1120
00:40:58.075 --> 00:41:00.054
and then the road to recovery

1121
00:41:00.054 --> 00:41:03.572
ties back into what the collective is about to experience.

1122
00:41:03.572 --> 00:41:07.481
How does Kirael explain what we're about to experience?

1123
00:41:07.481 --> 00:41:08.747
<v ->Well he says three days of darkness,</v>

1124
00:41:08.747 --> 00:41:09.967
he means it totally.

1125
00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:12.643
The whole earth plane is going to go dark.

1126
00:41:12.643 --> 00:41:14.206
It's because of the photon energy

1127
00:41:14.206 --> 00:41:15.563
is gonna be coming around the earth plane,

1128
00:41:15.563 --> 00:41:18.187
and it's gonna blot out the sun partially,

1129
00:41:18.187 --> 00:41:20.557
not blot it out completely, but make enough to dark.

1130
00:41:20.557 --> 00:41:21.615
<v Host>Does this have anything to do</v>

1131
00:41:21.615 --> 00:41:22.880
with polarity shifts?

1132
00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.053
<v ->Absolutely, yes, yeah,</v>

1133
00:41:24.053 --> 00:41:25.226
pole shifts are gonna moving.
<v Host>So he's saying</v>

1134
00:41:25.226 --> 00:41:25.985
the same thing.

1135
00:41:25.985 --> 00:41:27.525
<v ->Yeah, yeah, there's nothing new.</v>

1136
00:41:27.525 --> 00:41:30.538
<v Host>The Maya Hopi are saying the same thing.</v>

1137
00:41:30.538 --> 00:41:32.495
<v ->Gregg Braden did a thing, you know.</v>

1138
00:41:32.495 --> 00:41:34.058
<v Host>He was one of the first, 20 years ago,</v>

1139
00:41:34.058 --> 00:41:35.485
he was talking about it.
<v Kahu>Right, we're doing,</v>

1140
00:41:35.485 --> 00:41:36.726
the same we're doing.
<v Host>So you're saying</v>

1141
00:41:36.726 --> 00:41:37.745
that is on target, we're headed

1142
00:41:37.745 --> 00:41:38.725
that direction for
<v Kahu>That's absolutely</v>

1143
00:41:38.725 --> 00:41:40.296
for a pole shift.
<v Kahu>right.</v>

1144
00:41:40.296 --> 00:41:42.044
<v Host>And so the effect of that?</v>

1145
00:41:42.044 --> 00:41:43.332
<v ->The effect of that is,</v>

1146
00:41:43.332 --> 00:41:47.082
and this is gonna be, let's go for the mind blower, okay.

1147
00:41:47.082 --> 00:41:49.450
Master Kirael says that

1148
00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:51.865
we're gonna have about two billion people,

1149
00:41:51.865 --> 00:41:54.855
two billion people when this is all over with.

1150
00:41:54.855 --> 00:41:56.028
Now if you know the head count

1151
00:41:56.028 --> 00:41:57.409
on the earth plane,
<v Host>Well that's</v>

1152
00:41:57.409 --> 00:41:58.520
six and a half billion, yeah.

1153
00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.211
<v ->It's six and a half billion, yeah.</v>

1154
00:42:00.211 --> 00:42:01.611
I'll tell you this, my friend,

1155
00:42:01.611 --> 00:42:03.614
because this is important that I say this,

1156
00:42:03.614 --> 00:42:04.946
and it might be the most important thing

1157
00:42:04.946 --> 00:42:07.846
I'll say all day, because this,

1158
00:42:07.846 --> 00:42:10.583
when we get to this point where we have

1159
00:42:10.583 --> 00:42:15.069
two billion people left out of six billion potentials,

1160
00:42:15.069 --> 00:42:17.161
two billion, what happened to the other

1161
00:42:17.161 --> 00:42:18.749
four billion?

1162
00:42:18.749 --> 00:42:20.565
Four billion, for instance, I had a lady

1163
00:42:20.565 --> 00:42:23.602
in the seminar yesterday here in Sacramento.

1164
00:42:23.602 --> 00:42:27.972
She had two aspects of her,

1165
00:42:27.972 --> 00:42:30.777
aspects of her, one was in China,

1166
00:42:30.777 --> 00:42:32.571
and one was in Africa.

1167
00:42:32.571 --> 00:42:34.549
And the one in China was burning

1168
00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:38.449
14 to 16 hours a day, every day,

1169
00:42:39.435 --> 00:42:42.282
14 to 16 hours in meditation,

1170
00:42:42.282 --> 00:42:43.432
traveling around the world,

1171
00:42:43.432 --> 00:42:44.837
doing everything he wanted to do.

1172
00:42:44.837 --> 00:42:46.628
Another one who turns out to be

1173
00:42:46.628 --> 00:42:50.811
in an African body is like a Shaman priest,

1174
00:42:50.811 --> 00:42:52.951
and doing the healing journey,

1175
00:42:52.951 --> 00:42:56.283
and how is this little girl gonna be with Master Kirael,

1176
00:42:56.283 --> 00:42:58.378
how does she get this energy?

1177
00:42:58.378 --> 00:43:00.678
Because at the time of the great shift,

1178
00:43:00.678 --> 00:43:02.227
most of 'em are just gonna be,

1179
00:43:02.227 --> 00:43:04.447
or prior to the great shift,

1180
00:43:04.447 --> 00:43:05.965
gonna be leaving out here.

1181
00:43:05.965 --> 00:43:07.691
They're gonna be leaving by droves

1182
00:43:07.691 --> 00:43:08.740
and droves of these bodies.

1183
00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.169
<v Host>When you say they're going to be leaving,</v>

1184
00:43:10.169 --> 00:43:11.111
who's going to be leaving?

1185
00:43:11.111 --> 00:43:12.788
<v ->That is this aspect.</v>

1186
00:43:12.788 --> 00:43:16.186
There's a human aspect of this Chinese young lady,

1187
00:43:16.186 --> 00:43:18.255
and an African aspect.

1188
00:43:18.255 --> 00:43:20.348
They're gonna leave and they're gonna merge

1189
00:43:20.348 --> 00:43:22.211
on the way out, they're gonna merge their energy

1190
00:43:22.211 --> 00:43:24.143
into this little Chinese lady,

1191
00:43:24.143 --> 00:43:25.639
and she's gonna get all this knowledge

1192
00:43:25.639 --> 00:43:28.330
of this guy who's spending 16 to 18 hours a day

1193
00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:31.710
every day, and this Shamanic priest

1194
00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:35.574
of Africa, they're gonna give all this energy to her,

1195
00:43:35.574 --> 00:43:37.491
and what's she to do with it?

1196
00:43:37.491 --> 00:43:40.218
Because, and this is too much for you

1197
00:43:40.218 --> 00:43:42.725
to try to understand in this short a term,

1198
00:43:42.725 --> 00:43:44.381
but you know, what are we gonna do

1199
00:43:44.381 --> 00:43:45.593
with those two bodies?

1200
00:43:46.681 --> 00:43:49.991
Or four billion bodies?

1201
00:43:49.991 --> 00:43:51.440
What are we gonna do with four billion bodies?

1202
00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.976
<v Host>So let me just,</v>

1203
00:43:52.976 --> 00:43:54.537
let me get conceptually.

1204
00:43:56.081 --> 00:43:57.198
Are you saying that

1205
00:43:58.605 --> 00:44:00.398
certain individuals, or most individuals

1206
00:44:00.398 --> 00:44:02.123
have more than one aspect that's incarnating

1207
00:44:02.123 --> 00:44:03.020
at one time?

1208
00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:04.033
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

1209
00:44:04.033 --> 00:44:05.044
<v Host>Most people are.</v>

1210
00:44:05.044 --> 00:44:06.631
So in other words, there's another

1211
00:44:06.631 --> 00:44:08.952
aspect of ourselves that could be incarnated

1212
00:44:08.952 --> 00:44:11.317
somewhere else, and we're going to,

1213
00:44:11.317 --> 00:44:12.890
we're going to have it narrowed down to

1214
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:16.202
one incarnated being per consciousness,

1215
00:44:16.202 --> 00:44:16.822
is what you're saying?

1216
00:44:16.822 --> 00:44:18.117
<v ->Mmm-hmm, yeah.</v>

1217
00:44:18.117 --> 00:44:19.627
And you're gonna get it all back, too.

1218
00:44:19.627 --> 00:44:21.213
For instance, you,

1219
00:44:21.213 --> 00:44:22.501
I don't know who your aspects are,

1220
00:44:22.501 --> 00:44:24.387
we could call Master Kirael and he'd tell you,

1221
00:44:24.387 --> 00:44:27.032
but you have to know that you're,

1222
00:44:27.032 --> 00:44:30.506
you're doing something for human kind right now.

1223
00:44:30.506 --> 00:44:33.815
You're doing a service that you can't even understand it.

1224
00:44:33.815 --> 00:44:36.848
I can tell you this, he's telling me, you know,

1225
00:44:36.848 --> 00:44:38.941
he's not saying anything, but he's telling me

1226
00:44:38.941 --> 00:44:40.945
what I'm to talk about.

1227
00:44:40.945 --> 00:44:42.301
What this whole journey's about,

1228
00:44:42.301 --> 00:44:46.505
you're doing this unbelievable subjects

1229
00:44:46.505 --> 00:44:48.163
of things that you're doing,

1230
00:44:48.163 --> 00:44:50.187
of the people that need to hear it.

1231
00:44:50.187 --> 00:44:51.867
And that's why you have so many listeners

1232
00:44:51.867 --> 00:44:54.765
that you come in, and they hear you talk,

1233
00:44:54.765 --> 00:44:56.897
and they may listen to me, and they say,

1234
00:44:56.897 --> 00:44:58.050
"Oh, this guy's too weird,

1235
00:44:58.050 --> 00:44:59.447
"I'll just wait till the next guy comes up."

1236
00:44:59.447 --> 00:45:00.807
That's okay, because

1237
00:45:00.807 --> 00:45:03.290
if I get one person that'll listen to me,

1238
00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:05.890
because you have got this power,

1239
00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:08.488
and you're gonna have this other aspect.

1240
00:45:08.488 --> 00:45:10.282
I can't tell you whether, he could tell you,

1241
00:45:10.282 --> 00:45:12.925
but you have two aspects on this earth plane.

1242
00:45:12.925 --> 00:45:15.089
That's just the way we come into this whole journey.

1243
00:45:15.089 --> 00:45:18.310
You go back up into this whole thing that we call the earth,

1244
00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:21.623
and this journey to earth.

1245
00:45:21.623 --> 00:45:24.126
Whether you call it God-created or Jesus,

1246
00:45:24.126 --> 00:45:26.057
or whatever, it doesn't matter you call him,

1247
00:45:26.057 --> 00:45:28.725
but at some point somethin' called you

1248
00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:30.680
to come to this earth plane.

1249
00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.233
You came through four bodies to get here.

1250
00:45:33.233 --> 00:45:35.211
You came in through your spirit body,

1251
00:45:35.211 --> 00:45:36.431
you call it your higher self,

1252
00:45:36.431 --> 00:45:37.580
what you call it doesn't matter.

1253
00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:39.444
But you figure out what you're gonna do.

1254
00:45:39.444 --> 00:45:40.915
Then you came into the mental body.

1255
00:45:40.915 --> 00:45:42.479
You've got this omni brain,

1256
00:45:42.479 --> 00:45:44.159
not this local brain, but the omni brain,

1257
00:45:44.159 --> 00:45:46.367
this omni presence, and you decided

1258
00:45:46.367 --> 00:45:49.448
all the things that you wanted to do on this journey,

1259
00:45:49.448 --> 00:45:51.404
including what you're doing right now.

1260
00:45:51.404 --> 00:45:52.388
Then you came into the emotional,

1261
00:45:52.388 --> 00:45:54.342
and this is the beautiful part of us.

1262
00:45:54.342 --> 00:45:58.120
You're a beautiful lady, and your emotion is just,

1263
00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.364
I've realized, once in a while I see your whole

1264
00:46:00.364 --> 00:46:02.824
demeanor change of how you hit somethin',

1265
00:46:02.824 --> 00:46:05.216
and I see you go right into this whole journey,

1266
00:46:05.216 --> 00:46:08.252
and then you get in the physical body, right.

1267
00:46:08.252 --> 00:46:11.610
But at that point your aspects are already here.

1268
00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:14.482
They know that this great shift is coming.

1269
00:46:14.482 --> 00:46:15.635
They probably know more about it

1270
00:46:15.635 --> 00:46:17.636
than you and I'll ever know, because

1271
00:46:17.636 --> 00:46:20.073
their whole journey is to be feeding you

1272
00:46:20.073 --> 00:46:21.408
with this information,

1273
00:46:21.408 --> 00:46:22.788
and what you're doing is you're talking

1274
00:46:22.788 --> 00:46:24.673
to all these people around the world,

1275
00:46:24.673 --> 00:46:26.353
and you're gettin' all this information,

1276
00:46:26.353 --> 00:46:28.185
and you're gonna, you know,

1277
00:46:28.185 --> 00:46:30.422
you've done this interview with me,

1278
00:46:30.422 --> 00:46:31.848
and it's gonna be gone because tomorrow

1279
00:46:31.848 --> 00:46:33.182
you've gotta do another interview,

1280
00:46:33.182 --> 00:46:36.477
but understand this, I've touched some place

1281
00:46:36.477 --> 00:46:38.725
in your psyche, I've touched you somewhere,

1282
00:46:38.725 --> 00:46:40.352
and you're gonna remember certain things.

1283
00:46:40.352 --> 00:46:42.514
If they're necessary for you to remember.

1284
00:46:42.514 --> 00:46:44.103
If you don't you let 'em all go.

1285
00:46:44.103 --> 00:46:45.780
Don't even try to hold onto 'em.

1286
00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:47.967
Because there's too much to my life

1287
00:46:47.967 --> 00:46:49.669
or your life or anybody's life,

1288
00:46:49.669 --> 00:46:52.982
you just have to take it in and put it back in there.

1289
00:46:52.982 --> 00:46:55.514
Tie into this omni brain and just

1290
00:46:55.514 --> 00:46:56.659
download it in there, you know,

1291
00:46:56.659 --> 00:46:58.310
that's where you really want to go, because

1292
00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:00.725
There's too much in the local brain anyway. (laughs)

1293
00:47:00.725 --> 00:47:01.734
<v Host>Yeah, there is.</v>

1294
00:47:01.734 --> 00:47:04.658
There is too much, and I do trust the omni brain.

1295
00:47:04.658 --> 00:47:07.325
And so how do we,

1296
00:47:07.325 --> 00:47:11.669
so through events that you would consider to be more

1297
00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:15.022
physical in nature,

1298
00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:19.234
the four million bodies go away?

1299
00:47:19.234 --> 00:47:21.968
<v ->They just, literally, go away.</v>

1300
00:47:21.968 --> 00:47:22.569
<v Host>Okay.</v>

1301
00:47:22.569 --> 00:47:24.109
<v ->That's (laughs) for me,</v>

1302
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:25.204
that's a hard one to believe in.

1303
00:47:25.204 --> 00:47:26.332
But Master Kirael--
<v Host>Yeah, it is.</v>

1304
00:47:26.332 --> 00:47:27.574
I mean, I've heard a lot of different things.

1305
00:47:27.574 --> 00:47:29.097
You think earth changes,

1306
00:47:29.097 --> 00:47:31.828
living along the coastal lines, all these obvious things,

1307
00:47:31.828 --> 00:47:33.599
but simply go away?

1308
00:47:33.599 --> 00:47:35.670
<v ->They just simply,</v>

1309
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:38.177
I guess the magic of Master Jesus,

1310
00:47:38.177 --> 00:47:39.667
or not Master Jesus but the God, Creator,

1311
00:47:39.667 --> 00:47:41.461
whatever you want to call him,

1312
00:47:41.461 --> 00:47:43.739
he's just a master beyond masters,

1313
00:47:43.739 --> 00:47:45.739
and I guess if it comes down to it,

1314
00:47:45.739 --> 00:47:48.224
he can take anything he wants to do,

1315
00:47:48.224 --> 00:47:52.778
and just lift this whole journey, just come to,

1316
00:47:52.778 --> 00:47:54.273
you know we're not solid, right?

1317
00:47:54.273 --> 00:47:55.492
None of us are solid.

1318
00:47:55.492 --> 00:47:56.940
And so what does it mean to,

1319
00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:00.066
if you hit, if I shot which of 'em,

1320
00:48:00.066 --> 00:48:01.907
and you just broke down into nothing,

1321
00:48:01.907 --> 00:48:03.263
and you went away.

1322
00:48:03.263 --> 00:48:05.791
That'd be the end of it, right?

1323
00:48:05.791 --> 00:48:08.599
It's hard for me to believe, but, you know,

1324
00:48:08.599 --> 00:48:10.186
he has never,

1325
00:48:10.186 --> 00:48:11.405
<v Host>He hasn't lied to you yet.</v>

1326
00:48:11.405 --> 00:48:14.786
<v ->20 years, he's never, ever even close to,</v>

1327
00:48:14.786 --> 00:48:16.972
my wife would tell you in a heartbeat

1328
00:48:16.972 --> 00:48:19.571
why she loves him, because he is the truth.

1329
00:48:19.571 --> 00:48:21.088
He always speaks truth.

1330
00:48:21.088 --> 00:48:24.516
And he's never said that we're just gonna disappear.

1331
00:48:24.516 --> 00:48:28.080
But he tells us you're just not gonna be there anymore.

1332
00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:29.620
<v Host>But then one aspect will be here,</v>

1333
00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:31.460
but it's consolidated,

1334
00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.044
we're a consolidated being,

1335
00:48:33.044 --> 00:48:34.792
where all knowledges from all aspects

1336
00:48:34.792 --> 00:48:36.497
are brought into the one physical.

1337
00:48:36.497 --> 00:48:38.291
<v ->Take this little Chinese girl in my office,</v>

1338
00:48:38.291 --> 00:48:39.944
seminar yesterday, because she was going,

1339
00:48:39.944 --> 00:48:42.615
eyes about this big around, little Chinese eyes, big,

1340
00:48:42.615 --> 00:48:44.362
'cause she's saying,

1341
00:48:44.362 --> 00:48:47.421
she felt all this that I've just told her,

1342
00:48:47.421 --> 00:48:48.799
she felt it.

1343
00:48:48.799 --> 00:48:53.563
And so with this guy, this Chinese man in China,

1344
00:48:53.563 --> 00:48:56.665
he just simply is going to come to a space

1345
00:48:56.665 --> 00:48:59.059
and time and he's just gonna let go,

1346
00:48:59.059 --> 00:49:00.532
and he's gonna come to her,

1347
00:49:00.532 --> 00:49:02.854
and he's gonna download this.

1348
00:49:02.854 --> 00:49:04.901
He's 118 years or something like that,

1349
00:49:04.901 --> 00:49:06.788
118 years old, he's gonna give

1350
00:49:06.788 --> 00:49:08.881
all this information to her.

1351
00:49:08.881 --> 00:49:10.467
He's been meditating for years and years

1352
00:49:10.467 --> 00:49:12.327
and years of meditation.

1353
00:49:12.327 --> 00:49:14.627
The other journeys and other worlds and spaces

1354
00:49:14.627 --> 00:49:16.861
and times and all this stuff,

1355
00:49:16.861 --> 00:49:19.504
and then this African guy, he's gonna come up

1356
00:49:19.504 --> 00:49:21.735
and two guys, and she's a little,

1357
00:49:21.735 --> 00:49:23.575
she's a little tiny thing, you know.

1358
00:49:23.575 --> 00:49:25.530
But that's where it comes up.

1359
00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:28.635
Their body is gonna be lifted or gone or whatever.

1360
00:49:28.635 --> 00:49:30.499
That's gonna be gone, but their consciousness

1361
00:49:30.499 --> 00:49:32.937
is gonna go into this little girl here,

1362
00:49:32.937 --> 00:49:35.512
and she's gonna be able to speak for them

1363
00:49:35.512 --> 00:49:36.916
and herself as well.

1364
00:49:36.916 --> 00:49:38.664
And that's the most beautiful part.

1365
00:49:38.664 --> 00:49:40.848
Because, you know, you've gotta understand.

1366
00:49:40.848 --> 00:49:42.090
We've got too many people on this earth plane

1367
00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:43.906
right now, as it is.

1368
00:49:43.906 --> 00:49:46.161
But there's so many of them are just gonna go out,

1369
00:49:46.161 --> 00:49:47.379
phew, gone.

1370
00:49:47.379 --> 00:49:50.712
You said coastal journeys and so on and so forth.

1371
00:49:50.712 --> 00:49:52.161
A lot of 'em are gonna go out there.

1372
00:49:52.161 --> 00:49:54.576
But some of them are just plain gonna,

1373
00:49:54.576 --> 00:49:56.002
I hate to say it, because it

1374
00:49:56.002 --> 00:49:57.586
makes me sound like such a fool, but

1375
00:49:57.586 --> 00:50:00.841
I'm not, I don't mean to doubt, but I'll tell you this.

1376
00:50:02.086 --> 00:50:04.042
To me it sounds a little better than havin'

1377
00:50:04.042 --> 00:50:06.891
four billion people lying around rotting.

1378
00:50:06.891 --> 00:50:08.037
You know what I'm sayin'?

1379
00:50:08.037 --> 00:50:09.097
Rotting?
<v Host>Oh, definitely</v>

1380
00:50:09.097 --> 00:50:11.015
sounds quite a lot better.

1381
00:50:11.015 --> 00:50:11.969
I'll give you that one.

1382
00:50:11.969 --> 00:50:14.016
(laughing)

1383
00:50:14.016 --> 00:50:15.440
I have a question.

1384
00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:16.590
Do you have a little more time,

1385
00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:17.897
or are you pushed to go?
<v Kahu>I'm fine.</v>

1386
00:50:17.897 --> 00:50:18.843
No, I'm all right.

1387
00:50:18.843 --> 00:50:21.068
<v Host>Okay, good, because you know what?</v>

1388
00:50:21.068 --> 00:50:22.937
There's so much more to talk to you about.

1389
00:50:22.937 --> 00:50:24.870
I'd like to wrap up this interview,

1390
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:26.916
and I would like to pick it up again,

1391
00:50:26.916 --> 00:50:28.225
and we'll share that.

1392
00:50:28.225 --> 00:50:29.191
<v Kahu>All right.</v>
Okay.

1393
00:50:29.191 --> 00:50:30.433
<v Kahu>All right, very good.</v>

1394
00:50:30.433 --> 00:50:31.348
Thank you.

1395
00:50:31.348 --> 00:50:35.387
(mystical music)

1396
00:50:35.387 --> 00:50:37.191
<v ->Next month we'll share the continuation</v>

1397
00:50:37.191 --> 00:50:40.088
of our conversation with this gentle medium.

1398
00:50:40.088 --> 00:50:41.721
There is more intrigue to come.

1399
00:50:41.721 --> 00:50:44.202
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
