00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.511
<v ->What if the field of astrophysics has it wrong?</v>

2
00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:06.051
In this age of discovery, there's new evidence

3
00:00:06.051 --> 00:00:08.770
that our sun is not a gigantic lone star,

4
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.651
with planets rotating around it, rather it's rotating

5
00:00:11.651 --> 00:00:14.651
around its own partner, taking all of us with it.

6
00:00:14.651 --> 00:00:17.571
This partnership is called a binary star system.

7
00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:20.251
And more than half of the sun stars in our galaxy

8
00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:21.831
do have companions.

9
00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:23.611
What does this mean to the big picture?

10
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:25.850
A lot, according to Walter Cruttenden,

11
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.651
it means that our planet, and the human species,

12
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:31.331
goes through cycles of evolution and decline,

13
00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:34.911
wakefulness and discovery, to sleep and forgetfulness.

14
00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:39.021
(soft brass music)

15
00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:45.490
Assume that everybody watching this has already

16
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.320
watched Part 1, and has some good background.

17
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.060
And at the end of Part 1, we talked about Sirius.

18
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.539
You had actually named names, and now,

19
00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.000
this is several months down the road,

20
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.580
and you're much more bold in talking about

21
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.480
the notion that Sirius is the companion

22
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.000
star to the sun.

23
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.660
Can we start this interview talking a little bit

24
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.860
about some of the common themes that have

25
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.499
run through ancient text structures and so forth,

26
00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:11.440
regarding the importance of Sirius?

27
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.320
<v ->Well, Sirius is the brightest start in the sky.</v>

28
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.920
And it's been a special star to

29
00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:22.529
virtually every ancient culture.

30
00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:24.449
I think right here, where we are,

31
00:01:24.449 --> 00:01:27.510
in Hopi land, they called it the Blue Kochina.

32
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.950
And the ancient Egyptians referred to is as Isis,

33
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.300
which is their number one god.

34
00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:38.189
So it's sort of a magical star from

35
00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.770
a myth and folklore standpoint,

36
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.090
but you know, we've been investigating it

37
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.329
from a scientific standpoint.

38
00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.180
And it has some amazing traits there, also.

39
00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.770
For example, it is

40
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.421
the heaviest star in our local neighborhood.

41
00:01:56.421 --> 00:01:59.621
The Sirius system, it actually has another little star

42
00:01:59.621 --> 00:02:02.981
that goes around it, itself, called Sirius B.

43
00:02:02.981 --> 00:02:06.271
And together they,

44
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:08.481
it's about three solar masses,

45
00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:10.542
so on one of the big Einstein grids,

46
00:02:10.542 --> 00:02:13.082
it would be the heavy point,

47
00:02:13.082 --> 00:02:15.782
which lends some credence to

48
00:02:15.782 --> 00:02:19.752
our idea that our system may go around that.

49
00:02:19.762 --> 00:02:23.491
Although we still have the classical Newtonian problems.

50
00:02:25.982 --> 00:02:28.042
Both from a myth and folklore standpoint, and

51
00:02:28.042 --> 00:02:31.262
from a scientific standpoint, it's seems to have some

52
00:02:31.262 --> 00:02:35.202
characteristics that make it look

53
00:02:35.202 --> 00:02:36.462
like a companion.

54
00:02:36.462 --> 00:02:39.742
I mean, heck, if the brightest star in the sky is our sun,

55
00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:42.202
the second brightest star would have a good chance

56
00:02:42.202 --> 00:02:43.762
of being our companion.

57
00:02:43.762 --> 00:02:46.380
<v ->And there is a lot of lore, ancient lore,</v>

58
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.540
that talks about this,

59
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.460
often called the Dog star, in many cultures.

60
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.561
Many ancient cultures appear to have called it

61
00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:55.122
the Dog star, meaning, as in following

62
00:02:55.122 --> 00:02:58.522
the main star, following the star, as perhaps

63
00:02:58.522 --> 00:02:59.762
what that reference might mean.

64
00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:01.941
Can you talk a little bit about that, so we can

65
00:03:01.941 --> 00:03:04.082
just see where the seeds around the planet were

66
00:03:04.082 --> 00:03:05.661
of this understanding?

67
00:03:05.661 --> 00:03:09.142
<v ->Yes, I don't remember all the different references,</v>

68
00:03:09.142 --> 00:03:12.222
I put in the book, but it's been called the Dog,

69
00:03:12.222 --> 00:03:16.741
the Hound, the Fox, the Wolf, which is

70
00:03:16.741 --> 00:03:20.382
you know, it's all a dog-like character that

71
00:03:20.382 --> 00:03:23.102
seems to run across the sky.

72
00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:26.362
And indeed, if it was the companion star,

73
00:03:26.362 --> 00:03:30.082
it would move relative to other stars.

74
00:03:30.082 --> 00:03:32.802
<v ->And that is a really interesting point.</v>

75
00:03:32.802 --> 00:03:35.822
This, to me, is so fascinating, because certainly

76
00:03:35.822 --> 00:03:39.361
we're beginning to understand how

77
00:03:39.361 --> 00:03:41.622
wise the Egyptians were in their understanding

78
00:03:41.622 --> 00:03:45.430
of cosmology, and one of the primary

79
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.702
edifices, the Queen's chamber has that shaft,

80
00:03:48.702 --> 00:03:51.482
and the shaft points directly to Sirius, and

81
00:03:51.482 --> 00:03:54.621
I heard you in a talk, just yesterday, saying,

82
00:03:54.621 --> 00:03:57.222
"Why would the Egyptians create

83
00:03:57.222 --> 00:04:00.822
"this incredible structure, locking onto Sirius

84
00:04:00.822 --> 00:04:02.682
"for us, right now, because we're viewing it

85
00:04:02.682 --> 00:04:05.422
"right now," and the answer was.

86
00:04:05.422 --> 00:04:08.682
<v ->It could be that it always points to Sirius.</v>

87
00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:10.282
And this goes against

88
00:04:10.282 --> 00:04:13.722
conventional thinking about Precession.

89
00:04:13.722 --> 00:04:17.302
Precession theory is now

90
00:04:17.302 --> 00:04:20.361
that all stars move across the sky in a roughly

91
00:04:20.361 --> 00:04:22.540
the same rate, 50 arc seconds,

92
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.821
due to a wobbling earth.

93
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:28.820
But if we are, indeed in a companion star system,

94
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.001
a binary system, there would be one star

95
00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:36.061
that would stay relatively the same, in comparison

96
00:04:36.061 --> 00:04:40.460
to earth coordinates, and yet move across the sky.

97
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.861
<v ->If they're gravitationally bound like that.</v>

98
00:04:42.861 --> 00:04:46.910
<v ->Yes, and there's some, you know,</v>

99
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.331
it's just some interesting comments about Sirius

100
00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:54.651
over the years, that it's just not moving very much.

101
00:04:54.651 --> 00:04:58.708
The ancient Egyptians, you know, used it to keep time.

102
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.008
And so it looks like

103
00:05:03.368 --> 00:05:05.469
this tiny little shaft

104
00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:07.580
which really only points to about

105
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.239
one or two degrees of sky during the whole

106
00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:13.379
Precession cycle, so that's you know, 70, 100,

107
00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:16.459
120 years, something like that.

108
00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:20.719
Why would they point it to that star, during our lifetime.

109
00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:21.639
<v ->For us, now.</v>

110
00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.360
<v ->Yeah, it's their number one god.</v>

111
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.839
<v ->Now, that doesn't make sense, because</v>

112
00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:26.389
they did know what they were doing.

113
00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:28.069
But what you say makes total sense,

114
00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:29.529
just like holding hands with someone

115
00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:32.129
and spinning around, you're gravitationally

116
00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:34.209
directly opposed to each other.

117
00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.149
<v ->Yes, it's like we're on opposite sides of</v>

118
00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:39.330
a merry-go-round, so we,

119
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.149
the two horses on the merry-go-round,

120
00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:43.809
always stay the same in relationship to each other,

121
00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:46.110
whereas everything in the background goes by.

122
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.710
<v ->Which is why they would notice that the sun,</v>

123
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.349
that the ancients would have noticed that

124
00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:54.630
the background of stars moved in contrast to Sirius.

125
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.589
<v ->Exactly.</v>

126
00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:59.009
<v ->Well, this is actually making a whole lot of sense.</v>

127
00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:01.769
But you say the Newtonian problem,

128
00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:04.329
can you talk about what the Newtonian problem is

129
00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:05.589
in all of this?

130
00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:09.709
<v ->Well, yes, according to classical Newtonian mechanics,</v>

131
00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.580
and the speed that we believe our solar system

132
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.980
is moving, in order to get around Sirius,

133
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.180
and back, it would take over a million years.

134
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.140
And this is why we so thoroughly explored

135
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.510
the Dark Star scenario, in Lost Star of Myth and Time,

136
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.610
the Brown dwarf or Black hole idea that

137
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.662
you know, if we are in this binary system,

138
00:06:35.662 --> 00:06:40.102
that it should be fairly close, it should be actually

139
00:06:40.102 --> 00:06:42.902
only be a tenth of a light-year away

140
00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:46.062
in order to get around it in 24,000 years.

141
00:06:46.062 --> 00:06:50.492
So you know, I don't bring this up

142
00:06:50.492 --> 00:06:54.242
with astronomers, astrophysicists, very often.

143
00:06:54.242 --> 00:06:58.452
But there's a building body of evidence that indicates

144
00:06:58.452 --> 00:07:01.742
not only are we gravitationally bound to this star,

145
00:07:01.742 --> 00:07:04.842
but that the whole solar system might be going

146
00:07:04.842 --> 00:07:07.922
a lot faster than we thought it was.

147
00:07:07.922 --> 00:07:09.743
<v ->Does this have to do with some of the</v>

148
00:07:09.743 --> 00:07:12.262
calculations that Reg Cahill is doing?

149
00:07:12.262 --> 00:07:13.302
<v ->Yes.</v>

150
00:07:13.302 --> 00:07:15.642
<v Regina>This is interesting, can you just give us</v>

151
00:07:15.642 --> 00:07:19.402
a primer course on what the speed of the earth

152
00:07:19.402 --> 00:07:21.743
has always been thought to be,

153
00:07:21.743 --> 00:07:24.422
and what it appears the speed of the sun

154
00:07:24.422 --> 00:07:26.642
may actually be in this whole equation,

155
00:07:26.642 --> 00:07:28.862
and why this actually would work?

156
00:07:28.862 --> 00:07:30.842
<v ->Right, measuring celestial speed</v>

157
00:07:30.842 --> 00:07:32.842
is a real tricky business.

158
00:07:32.842 --> 00:07:35.182
We can do it locally, because you know,

159
00:07:35.182 --> 00:07:36.813
we're on the surface of the earth,

160
00:07:36.813 --> 00:07:39.782
the earth is roughly 24,000 miles in diameter,

161
00:07:39.782 --> 00:07:42.122
and it takes 24 hours to spin around once,

162
00:07:42.122 --> 00:07:44.882
so we're going 1,000 miles an hour.

163
00:07:44.882 --> 00:07:48.362
Or we know that the, how long the earth takes

164
00:07:48.362 --> 00:07:52.202
to get around the sun, and the rough size of that orbit,

165
00:07:52.202 --> 00:07:54.072
so we know that the earth moves

166
00:07:54.072 --> 00:07:56.953
about 66,000 miles an hour around the sun.

167
00:07:58.113 --> 00:08:00.542
So people have been trying to figure out,

168
00:08:00.542 --> 00:08:02.442
"Well, how fast is the sun going?"

169
00:08:02.442 --> 00:08:04.742
The solar system, and there's nothing

170
00:08:04.742 --> 00:08:07.443
to measure it by.

171
00:08:07.443 --> 00:08:08.764
You know, there's no

172
00:08:08.764 --> 00:08:11.022
speed markers or anything like that.

173
00:08:11.022 --> 00:08:12.912
<v ->And this is relevant to the notion of how it could</v>

174
00:08:12.912 --> 00:08:15.142
go in precession with a companion star,

175
00:08:15.142 --> 00:08:16.642
that far away, right?

176
00:08:16.642 --> 00:08:17.442
<v ->Yes.</v>

177
00:08:17.442 --> 00:08:18.262
<v ->Yes.</v>

178
00:08:18.262 --> 00:08:20.002
<v ->And so I think it's been assumed,</v>

179
00:08:20.002 --> 00:08:21.621
most textbooks that I've read says

180
00:08:21.621 --> 00:08:25.102
the earth is going about eight kilometers a second.

181
00:08:25.102 --> 00:08:29.162
But there's a fella out of Australia, Reg Cahill,

182
00:08:29.162 --> 00:08:31.942
with Flinders University down there, who is,

183
00:08:31.942 --> 00:08:34.702
has come up with a novel way of measuring

184
00:08:34.702 --> 00:08:36.472
the speed of the solar system, and he's measured it

185
00:08:36.472 --> 00:08:39.092
relative to the cosmic microwave background.

186
00:08:39.092 --> 00:08:41.912
The sort of, static radiation that is supposedly

187
00:08:41.912 --> 00:08:44.232
leftover from the Big Bang.

188
00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:47.243
And he says that it's going

189
00:08:47.243 --> 00:08:50.163
430 kilometers a second,

190
00:08:50.163 --> 00:08:53.443
which is, you know, considerably faster.

191
00:08:53.443 --> 00:08:56.062
And that happens to be just almost

192
00:08:56.062 --> 00:09:00.003
exactly the speed you need to get around a star

193
00:09:00.003 --> 00:09:03.993
like Sirius and back, which is about eight light-years,

194
00:09:03.993 --> 00:09:06.653
but it's heavier than us, and so the mid-point

195
00:09:06.653 --> 00:09:09.573
is you know, somewhere in between us,

196
00:09:09.573 --> 00:09:12.073
about two-thirds of the way, so we don't have to go

197
00:09:12.073 --> 00:09:15.173
draw a circle completely at eight light-years and out.

198
00:09:15.173 --> 00:09:18.053
We draw it at about six light-years and around.

199
00:09:18.053 --> 00:09:20.413
<v ->So it's looking that mathematically,</v>

200
00:09:20.413 --> 00:09:22.353
this is plausible now.

201
00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:24.933
<v ->It is, it is plausible, yes.</v>

202
00:09:24.933 --> 00:09:28.973
You know, in science, one or two guys

203
00:09:28.973 --> 00:09:31.573
saying something doesn't mean a whole lot.

204
00:09:31.573 --> 00:09:34.253
You have to get a lot of people to

205
00:09:34.253 --> 00:09:37.613
buy off on this work, and, but it's a start.

206
00:09:37.613 --> 00:09:39.813
You know, the fact that he came up

207
00:09:39.813 --> 00:09:42.872
with the same numbers that we had calculated

208
00:09:42.872 --> 00:09:45.853
as the speed you need is very, very interesting.

209
00:09:45.853 --> 00:09:48.692
<v ->Yes, it is, considering we can't take ancient knowledge</v>

210
00:09:48.692 --> 00:09:51.562
into consideration, because people think of ancients

211
00:09:51.562 --> 00:09:54.513
as primitive beings, and this is an area that

212
00:09:54.513 --> 00:09:56.873
we need to go into a little bit further, too.

213
00:09:56.873 --> 00:09:59.373
Because I find this the fascinating part, is.

214
00:09:59.373 --> 00:10:01.813
Well, let me just say this first,

215
00:10:01.813 --> 00:10:04.213
my understanding is, you have a team of people

216
00:10:04.213 --> 00:10:07.653
who are now actually focusing on looking

217
00:10:07.653 --> 00:10:11.153
for the companion, a companion to the sun.

218
00:10:11.153 --> 00:10:12.253
Is that correct?

219
00:10:12.253 --> 00:10:15.593
<v ->Yes, there's a few of us at the Binary Research Institute</v>

220
00:10:15.593 --> 00:10:18.884
and we do a lot of research,

221
00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:22.144
both on the binary scenario as well as

222
00:10:22.144 --> 00:10:25.973
ancient myth and folklore, trying to mine that,

223
00:10:25.973 --> 00:10:29.544
to figure out what they might have known about

224
00:10:29.544 --> 00:10:31.523
the companion star scenario.

225
00:10:31.523 --> 00:10:34.123
And then we've used people on a part-time basis,

226
00:10:34.123 --> 00:10:38.813
consulting basis, mathematicians, astrophysicists,

227
00:10:38.823 --> 00:10:40.663
and then there's people that are just working on it

228
00:10:40.663 --> 00:10:44.150
independently, for example, Richard Muller,

229
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:48.443
he's astronomer at UC Berkeley, he's been looking

230
00:10:48.443 --> 00:10:50.843
for a possible companion, so have Whitmire

231
00:10:50.843 --> 00:10:53.803
and Matese down at the University of Louisiana.

232
00:10:53.803 --> 00:10:56.564
Now, they're focused more on the classic,

233
00:10:56.564 --> 00:11:00.423
Newtonian scenario, but I think it's good

234
00:11:00.423 --> 00:11:03.284
that we, sort of exhaust those possibilities, before

235
00:11:03.284 --> 00:11:06.583
we start playing with the laws of gravity too much.

236
00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.503
<v ->Yeah, that seems to be necessary to exhaust it</v>

237
00:11:08.503 --> 00:11:11.303
before true, original thinking can be accepted.

238
00:11:11.303 --> 00:11:12.164
<v ->Yes.</v>

239
00:11:12.164 --> 00:11:13.884
<v ->It seems to be the way.</v>

240
00:11:13.884 --> 00:11:16.284
So, when you're looking at it,

241
00:11:16.284 --> 00:11:17.863
now all of you are looking for this,

242
00:11:17.863 --> 00:11:19.503
some of the math is starting to bear out,

243
00:11:19.503 --> 00:11:21.323
you're more bold, and so are some others,

244
00:11:21.323 --> 00:11:22.883
in talking about the fact, maybe the ancients

245
00:11:22.883 --> 00:11:24.883
did know something, and this gets to

246
00:11:24.883 --> 00:11:27.623
a really important point, which is

247
00:11:27.623 --> 00:11:29.683
the ancients did know something,

248
00:11:29.683 --> 00:11:31.603
there's too much evidence now as to

249
00:11:31.603 --> 00:11:34.564
very advanced civilizations, even as far back as

250
00:11:34.564 --> 00:11:38.383
10, 12,000 years ago, to ignore the fact that

251
00:11:39.803 --> 00:11:41.864
we're not necessarily at the top of

252
00:11:41.864 --> 00:11:44.123
our learning curve yet.

253
00:11:44.123 --> 00:11:47.103
In this phase, and this ties in, this consciousness

254
00:11:47.103 --> 00:11:51.003
ties in to the Precession,

255
00:11:51.003 --> 00:11:53.303
and the whole notion of Dark Ages,

256
00:11:53.303 --> 00:11:56.053
and Golden Ages happening, cyclically.

257
00:11:56.053 --> 00:11:58.153
Can you talk about this, a little bit?

258
00:11:58.153 --> 00:11:59.393
We mention it before, but maybe.

259
00:11:59.393 --> 00:12:02.493
<v ->Yes, just a quick little recap, then.</v>

260
00:12:02.493 --> 00:12:04.693
Ancient cultures all over the world

261
00:12:04.693 --> 00:12:06.893
believed in this vast cycle of time, with a

262
00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:09.793
Golden Age at one end, and a Dark Age at the other.

263
00:12:09.793 --> 00:12:13.313
One Precession of the Equinox, one eon,

264
00:12:13.313 --> 00:12:15.493
one Great Year, that played over,

265
00:12:15.493 --> 00:12:18.153
the Chinese called it.

266
00:12:18.153 --> 00:12:22.405
And there's so many references

267
00:12:22.405 --> 00:12:25.293
from so many disparate cultures, that

268
00:12:25.293 --> 00:12:27.953
you have to start to take it seriously.

269
00:12:27.953 --> 00:12:29.953
And indeed, when we do look at the

270
00:12:29.953 --> 00:12:32.433
archaelogical record, we find a tremendous amount

271
00:12:32.433 --> 00:12:34.853
of evidence of very advanced civilizations

272
00:12:34.853 --> 00:12:37.893
in the past, Mesopotamia,

273
00:12:37.893 --> 00:12:39.733
you know, Sumer declines to Akkad,

274
00:12:39.733 --> 00:12:42.333
declines to Babylon, declines to dust.

275
00:12:42.333 --> 00:12:44.713
Egypt, same thing, it's near its heighth,

276
00:12:44.713 --> 00:12:47.673
and goes to dust, and virtually every other culture

277
00:12:47.673 --> 00:12:50.173
around the world, and, including you know,

278
00:12:50.173 --> 00:12:53.353
Rome and the Chinese Hunan Dynasty

279
00:12:53.353 --> 00:12:55.652
are falling about the same time as the

280
00:12:55.652 --> 00:13:00.033
Mayans are crumbling, over here in the Americas.

281
00:13:00.033 --> 00:13:03.093
And then we have this dreadful Dark Age.

282
00:13:03.093 --> 00:13:05.293
I mean, it was getting bad on the way in,

283
00:13:05.293 --> 00:13:07.193
and then we're sort of coming out of it now.

284
00:13:07.193 --> 00:13:09.873
You know, with the Renaissance, rebirth and

285
00:13:09.873 --> 00:13:13.313
a cycle up, so they all seemed

286
00:13:13.313 --> 00:13:15.513
to tie it to this Precession of the Equinox.

287
00:13:15.513 --> 00:13:17.233
They keep saying something about the movement

288
00:13:17.233 --> 00:13:19.293
of the stars has something to do with it,

289
00:13:19.293 --> 00:13:22.313
and one star in particular.

290
00:13:22.313 --> 00:13:26.513
And so, that's what really pushed

291
00:13:26.513 --> 00:13:29.193
myself and our group to dig into this,

292
00:13:29.193 --> 00:13:33.033
to find out what astronomical phenomena

293
00:13:33.033 --> 00:13:36.772
actually is driving this rise and fall of the ages.

294
00:13:36.772 --> 00:13:38.733
And how does that work?

295
00:13:38.733 --> 00:13:40.693
<v ->And it actually impacts our consciousness,</v>

296
00:13:40.693 --> 00:13:43.612
and our ability to expand versus contract.

297
00:13:45.182 --> 00:13:49.253
Build versus decline, and so where we would

298
00:13:49.253 --> 00:13:51.532
theoretically be in all of this, or where we would be

299
00:13:51.532 --> 00:13:54.412
in all of this, is just past the nadir, and starting

300
00:13:54.412 --> 00:13:57.213
to come back up into awakening again,

301
00:13:57.213 --> 00:13:59.053
as a species, right?

302
00:13:59.053 --> 00:14:02.873
<v ->Yes, the Mithraic culture had this icon, with</v>

303
00:14:04.993 --> 00:14:06.882
the Zodiac in the middle, and these,

304
00:14:06.882 --> 00:14:10.082
these two boys, Cautes and Cautopates,

305
00:14:10.082 --> 00:14:12.423
holding a torch down when you're in the down cycle,

306
00:14:12.423 --> 00:14:14.762
and holding the torch up when you're in

307
00:14:14.762 --> 00:14:16.902
the ascending cycle, so I guess they're just

308
00:14:16.902 --> 00:14:18.423
starting to lift the torch up.

309
00:14:18.423 --> 00:14:20.423
<v ->(laughs) Just in the knick of time before</v>

310
00:14:20.423 --> 00:14:22.183
we blow the whole thing up.

311
00:14:22.183 --> 00:14:23.702
Some would say, again.

312
00:14:23.702 --> 00:14:26.823
I would like to read this little portion

313
00:14:26.823 --> 00:14:29.363
of your book, just a quick little passage

314
00:14:29.363 --> 00:14:31.363
because it seems like this might have

315
00:14:31.363 --> 00:14:33.703
something to do with the cosmic influence

316
00:14:33.703 --> 00:14:36.243
that affects our consciousness as a species.

317
00:14:36.243 --> 00:14:38.923
Which is important to know, if we're on the uprise again.

318
00:14:38.923 --> 00:14:41.843
It says here, "In the Old Testament, we read

319
00:14:41.843 --> 00:14:46.103
"Canst thou bind the sweet influences of the Pleiades

320
00:14:46.103 --> 00:14:49.143
"or loose the bounds of Orion."

321
00:14:49.143 --> 00:14:52.323
What does this mean, to "bind these influences"?

322
00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:55.003
<v ->Well, in trying--</v>

323
00:14:55.003 --> 00:14:57.652
<v ->Of the Pleiades, specifically.</v>

324
00:14:57.652 --> 00:14:59.382
<v ->Regina, In trying to figure out</v>

325
00:14:59.382 --> 00:15:01.983
how this system might work,

326
00:15:03.363 --> 00:15:06.902
we don't think that it's just going around another star,

327
00:15:06.902 --> 00:15:09.542
is the absolute influence on the rise and fall

328
00:15:09.542 --> 00:15:12.622
of civilization, we know that the spinning earth

329
00:15:12.622 --> 00:15:15.342
and the earth going around the sun affects our

330
00:15:15.342 --> 00:15:18.982
weather, and life, and consciousness to a mild degree.

331
00:15:18.982 --> 00:15:21.942
But, it's hard to see how it would affect

332
00:15:21.942 --> 00:15:25.422
the type of changes that we're talking about.

333
00:15:25.422 --> 00:15:27.342
<v ->Where you go to sleep, and then wake up,</v>

334
00:15:27.342 --> 00:15:30.303
go to sleep, wake up, destroy yourselves, rebuild.

335
00:15:30.303 --> 00:15:32.983
<v ->The sun does that, so.</v>

336
00:15:32.983 --> 00:15:35.623
So what some of the ancients have said,

337
00:15:35.623 --> 00:15:38.622
and probably the fella that said it the clearest,

338
00:15:38.622 --> 00:15:43.303
is newer, Swami Sri Yukteswar

339
00:15:43.303 --> 00:15:46.183
wrote this book in 1894,

340
00:15:46.183 --> 00:15:49.563
and said that there's another point,

341
00:15:49.563 --> 00:15:52.003
and it's the binary orbit that brings us closer

342
00:15:52.003 --> 00:15:54.083
to that other point.

343
00:15:54.083 --> 00:15:56.583
And some have called that the Seed of Brahma,

344
00:15:56.583 --> 00:15:58.923
some, the Grand Magnetic Center,

345
00:15:58.923 --> 00:16:02.063
the Central Sun, there's all sort of little references

346
00:16:03.083 --> 00:16:05.223
to it throughout history.

347
00:16:05.223 --> 00:16:07.983
And some have said it's the Pleiades.

348
00:16:07.983 --> 00:16:11.943
And so, that Bible quote is

349
00:16:11.943 --> 00:16:15.003
one of my favorites, it's possible that

350
00:16:15.003 --> 00:16:17.993
as we move in this binary system,

351
00:16:17.993 --> 00:16:21.013
now and then, in this 24,000 year cycle,

352
00:16:21.013 --> 00:16:22.757
we get close to the Pleiades,

353
00:16:22.757 --> 00:16:26.742
it has this sweet influence upon us,

354
00:16:26.742 --> 00:16:30.192
and then as the binary system moves us away,

355
00:16:30.192 --> 00:16:33.893
we have a lesser, less of that sweet influence,

356
00:16:33.893 --> 00:16:35.402
and we go into the darker ages.

357
00:16:35.402 --> 00:16:38.282
<v ->It's a wonderful passage, and it says,</v>

358
00:16:38.282 --> 00:16:40.822
what you, in response to that, your writing here

359
00:16:40.822 --> 00:16:43.542
it also conveys the idea that man cannot stop,

360
00:16:43.542 --> 00:16:46.822
"Canst thou bind," the celestial motion or orbit

361
00:16:46.822 --> 00:16:50.102
that takes us away from the sweet source.

362
00:16:50.102 --> 00:16:51.621
<v ->Yes, that's Job's--</v>

363
00:16:51.621 --> 00:16:54.702
<v ->Must be on a declining age, in the spectrum of things.</v>

364
00:16:54.702 --> 00:16:58.502
<v ->Exactly, and he's sort of asking a metaphorical question.</v>

365
00:16:59.652 --> 00:17:02.462
"Canst thou stop it," you know.

366
00:17:02.462 --> 00:17:06.632
And so it's, it's beautiful, the wisdom of the ancients

367
00:17:07.812 --> 00:17:11.022
that we completely lost, just about, except

368
00:17:11.022 --> 00:17:13.882
in very esoteric mystery schools, and things like that.

369
00:17:13.882 --> 00:17:15.882
And now it's sort of just creeping back out again.

370
00:17:15.882 --> 00:17:18.301
<v ->And you give an example also, of how we lost,</v>

371
00:17:18.301 --> 00:17:20.622
in modern times, how we lost the understanding

372
00:17:20.622 --> 00:17:23.902
of having heliocentric solar system, and then

373
00:17:23.902 --> 00:17:25.901
we remembered, can you talk about the timeline

374
00:17:25.901 --> 00:17:28.542
of how that decline descended, was forgotten

375
00:17:28.542 --> 00:17:29.942
and how it has come back?

376
00:17:29.942 --> 00:17:32.482
<v ->Yes, there's so much knowledge that was lost,</v>

377
00:17:32.482 --> 00:17:35.882
but the heliocentric system is, it's just a great example,

378
00:17:35.882 --> 00:17:38.952
because this was taught

379
00:17:38.952 --> 00:17:42.812
by Aristarchus of Samos, in ancient Greece,

380
00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:44.812
Archimedes talked about it,

381
00:17:44.812 --> 00:17:46.952
and there's one other Greek,

382
00:17:46.952 --> 00:17:49.592
whose name I can't recall off the top of my head,

383
00:17:49.592 --> 00:17:52.842
and this is about 500,

384
00:17:52.842 --> 00:17:55.642
400 B.C., in there,

385
00:17:55.642 --> 00:17:58.782
and then, you know, we just totally

386
00:17:58.782 --> 00:18:01.292
lose that information, Greece falls,

387
00:18:01.292 --> 00:18:03.312
Rome comes, it's even more brutal.

388
00:18:03.312 --> 00:18:05.091
<v ->Well, the little book burning didn't help.</v>

389
00:18:05.091 --> 00:18:07.332
<v ->(laughs) That's exactly right.</v>

390
00:18:07.332 --> 00:18:09.472
<v ->Losing Alexandria didn't help.</v>

391
00:18:09.472 --> 00:18:12.432
<v ->And then the idea is, we're just on a flat earth,</v>

392
00:18:12.432 --> 00:18:16.811
you know, and, but anyway, about the low point

393
00:18:16.811 --> 00:18:20.671
of the Dark Ages, we put around 500 A.D. or so,

394
00:18:20.671 --> 00:18:24.192
and so then 1,000 years after the low point,

395
00:18:24.192 --> 00:18:27.212
along comes Copernicus, who resurrects it.

396
00:18:27.212 --> 00:18:30.212
I just read a book on Copernicus,

397
00:18:30.212 --> 00:18:32.172
"the book that nobody read,"

398
00:18:32.172 --> 00:18:35.580
it's about de revolutionibus,

399
00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:40.082
and he had five books in his possession.

400
00:18:40.082 --> 00:18:43.892
Three of them were old Greek books.

401
00:18:44.882 --> 00:18:47.842
And so Copernicus was resurrecting

402
00:18:47.842 --> 00:18:49.222
ancient knowledge.

403
00:18:49.222 --> 00:18:51.442
You know, today, if you write a scientific paper,

404
00:18:51.442 --> 00:18:53.782
come out with a new theory, you will quote things

405
00:18:53.782 --> 00:18:56.382
that came two years before, or three years before,

406
00:18:56.382 --> 00:18:59.802
five or 10 years before, you don't go back 2,000 years.

407
00:18:59.802 --> 00:19:00.762
<v ->Right.</v>

408
00:19:00.762 --> 00:19:02.642
<v ->For the basis of your theories.</v>

409
00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:04.122
<v ->So, up 'til now, anyway, right?</v>

410
00:19:04.122 --> 00:19:05.202
<v ->Right.</v>

411
00:19:05.202 --> 00:19:07.442
So, it was lost 1,000 years before the depths of

412
00:19:07.442 --> 00:19:10.792
the Dark Ages, and found 1,000 years after.

413
00:19:10.792 --> 00:19:13.982
<v ->And that really coincides with the real, the low point,</v>

414
00:19:13.982 --> 00:19:16.702
the nadir of the descension, and starting to move

415
00:19:16.702 --> 00:19:18.542
back into the ascension of the awakening,

416
00:19:18.542 --> 00:19:21.922
the knowledge, going back toward the Golden.

417
00:19:21.922 --> 00:19:24.242
<v ->Yes, yeah, and we believe that low point</v>

418
00:19:24.242 --> 00:19:27.144
is when the two stars,

419
00:19:27.144 --> 00:19:29.784
our sun and its companion star,

420
00:19:29.784 --> 00:19:33.402
are at its farthest point apart, apoapsis,

421
00:19:33.402 --> 00:19:35.542
and then the high point is when

422
00:19:35.542 --> 00:19:38.332
they're at their closest distance.

423
00:19:38.332 --> 00:19:40.322
Which is periapsis.

424
00:19:40.322 --> 00:19:41.722
So we're on our way back up.

425
00:19:41.722 --> 00:19:43.562
<v ->We're on our way back up, but in the interim,</v>

426
00:19:43.562 --> 00:19:45.982
there are a lot of, there's a lot of interesting

427
00:19:45.982 --> 00:19:48.982
phenomenon going on, in terms of magnetic fields,

428
00:19:48.982 --> 00:19:51.622
and zero point, and all these other phenomenon.

429
00:19:51.622 --> 00:19:53.362
And I know that you have some associates

430
00:19:53.362 --> 00:19:55.902
that really dig deeply into that work.

431
00:19:55.902 --> 00:19:57.862
But can you, do you have any comment

432
00:19:57.862 --> 00:20:00.082
you'd like to make about some of that phenomenon,

433
00:20:00.082 --> 00:20:02.762
including just the Gauss frequencies alone,

434
00:20:02.762 --> 00:20:05.202
and what's happening, we're out of whack.

435
00:20:05.202 --> 00:20:07.522
We started, even 20 years ago, the earth

436
00:20:07.522 --> 00:20:09.202
is not functioning the same as it was,

437
00:20:09.202 --> 00:20:10.702
even 20 years ago.

438
00:20:10.702 --> 00:20:14.102
<v ->Yes, well, you know, I get the question all the time,</v>

439
00:20:14.102 --> 00:20:16.042
"Okay, so we're in a binary system, you know,

440
00:20:16.042 --> 00:20:19.142
"what's that mean to me, here and now?"

441
00:20:19.142 --> 00:20:21.142
And I think it means a lot.

442
00:20:21.142 --> 00:20:24.622
We hear so much nowadays about the expansion

443
00:20:24.622 --> 00:20:26.682
of consciousness that's going on.

444
00:20:26.682 --> 00:20:29.762
And if technology is a proxy, you know,

445
00:20:29.762 --> 00:20:31.842
our sheer inventiveness shows you that

446
00:20:31.842 --> 00:20:35.442
consciousness is expanding, and there's been

447
00:20:35.442 --> 00:20:37.902
three or four books, just come out,

448
00:20:37.902 --> 00:20:41.382
in the last few years that compare physical reality

449
00:20:41.382 --> 00:20:45.362
to virtual reality, or matrix, or a dream

450
00:20:45.362 --> 00:20:47.962
or a holograph, and there just seems to be

451
00:20:47.962 --> 00:20:51.242
more and more people that are,

452
00:20:51.242 --> 00:20:53.202
that are very conscious,

453
00:20:53.202 --> 00:20:56.482
channeling, psychic, you know,

454
00:20:56.482 --> 00:21:00.203
able to move this physical reality

455
00:21:00.203 --> 00:21:02.812
with their intention and thought and will.

456
00:21:04.052 --> 00:21:07.683
And, I see it related,

457
00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:10.301
I see this as a part of the ascending age,

458
00:21:10.301 --> 00:21:13.821
that, a matter of fact, Thureches, and Euctus were,

459
00:21:13.821 --> 00:21:16.701
and others talked about this, that as we move

460
00:21:16.701 --> 00:21:19.621
from the Dark Ages, where we only believe

461
00:21:19.621 --> 00:21:23.601
everything is solid and we're just flesh and bones

462
00:21:23.601 --> 00:21:26.741
and nothing more, we come into the

463
00:21:26.741 --> 00:21:30.662
just the first age up, the dupare uga,

464
00:21:30.672 --> 00:21:33.021
where we start to get an understanding

465
00:21:33.021 --> 00:21:35.561
of finer forces, and sure enough,

466
00:21:35.561 --> 00:21:37.661
we start to realize things are made

467
00:21:37.661 --> 00:21:39.441
out of molecules, those are made out of atoms,

468
00:21:39.441 --> 00:21:42.251
those are made out of protons,neutrons, electrons,

469
00:21:42.251 --> 00:21:45.021
and it's looking like those are made out of energy.

470
00:21:45.021 --> 00:21:47.241
And we're realizing more and more, I think

471
00:21:47.241 --> 00:21:49.361
that we are energy.

472
00:21:49.361 --> 00:21:52.621
And so, it's all connected, yes, there's a very

473
00:21:52.621 --> 00:21:55.921
positive growth and consciousness right now.

474
00:21:55.921 --> 00:21:59.301
And sure, we can affect that with our own free will

475
00:21:59.301 --> 00:22:02.221
and you know, those people that do things

476
00:22:02.221 --> 00:22:05.461
to tune in can go faster than the norm.

477
00:22:05.461 --> 00:22:09.241
But it's almost like the Creator himself

478
00:22:09.241 --> 00:22:11.801
just is lifting up the whole world right now,

479
00:22:11.801 --> 00:22:13.121
to some degree.

480
00:22:13.121 --> 00:22:15.041
<v ->And it is interesting, because if you go into</v>

481
00:22:15.041 --> 00:22:17.881
the metaphysical world, you have a lot of

482
00:22:17.881 --> 00:22:21.601
references of people being able to connect with

483
00:22:21.601 --> 00:22:24.901
the Pleiades, a lot of emphasis on Sirius.

484
00:22:24.901 --> 00:22:26.761
These are some of the most common.

485
00:22:26.761 --> 00:22:28.881
You have, one of our other interviewees,

486
00:22:28.881 --> 00:22:31.281
in fact, in studying the phenomenon

487
00:22:31.281 --> 00:22:34.201
of near-death experiences, has noted that

488
00:22:34.201 --> 00:22:37.021
many of the people, once they leave their body

489
00:22:37.021 --> 00:22:41.321
for that duration, often report going to Orion

490
00:22:41.321 --> 00:22:45.201
and back, and so there seems to be

491
00:22:45.201 --> 00:22:47.341
an awakening of an understanding

492
00:22:47.341 --> 00:22:50.381
of a connection to something larger.

493
00:22:50.381 --> 00:22:52.681
And it seems to be pointing back regularly

494
00:22:52.681 --> 00:22:55.581
to these same places now.

495
00:22:55.581 --> 00:22:58.511
<v ->It's really neat, what's going on,</v>

496
00:22:58.511 --> 00:23:01.641
in that we're changing from this

497
00:23:01.641 --> 00:23:05.982
purely physical explanation of things.

498
00:23:05.982 --> 00:23:07.312
You know, the Great Pyramid is

499
00:23:07.312 --> 00:23:09.452
just a big bunch of stones

500
00:23:09.452 --> 00:23:12.512
that happens to be in a pyramid shape, you know.

501
00:23:12.512 --> 00:23:14.612
<v ->To bury somebody.</v>

502
00:23:14.612 --> 00:23:18.653
<v ->Right, to realize that, boy, it's something much,</v>

503
00:23:18.653 --> 00:23:20.593
much more, you know.

504
00:23:20.593 --> 00:23:22.493
<v ->Yeah, sure more than a tomb, isn't it?</v>

505
00:23:22.493 --> 00:23:23.443
<v ->It sure is.</v>

506
00:23:23.443 --> 00:23:25.332
<v ->It seems from everything I've been reading,</v>

507
00:23:25.332 --> 00:23:28.212
it's about as alive as an edifice could possibly be.

508
00:23:28.212 --> 00:23:31.053
And literally pointing us to the knowledge

509
00:23:31.053 --> 00:23:33.333
we need to awaken to, and it sounds like

510
00:23:33.333 --> 00:23:35.712
you're one of the trumpets

511
00:23:35.712 --> 00:23:37.673
in this arena right now.

512
00:23:37.673 --> 00:23:40.093
<v ->Well, I'm blowing it hard, because I,</v>

513
00:23:40.093 --> 00:23:43.533
I see this rise and fall of civilization

514
00:23:43.533 --> 00:23:46.713
that's not explained with current theory.

515
00:23:46.713 --> 00:23:50.172
And the only way I can explain the phenomenon

516
00:23:50.172 --> 00:23:52.813
of precession, you know, it's so technical,

517
00:23:52.813 --> 00:23:56.093
I can't get into it here, there's about six or eight

518
00:23:56.093 --> 00:23:58.252
serious problems with the current theory

519
00:23:58.252 --> 00:24:00.813
of lunisolar precession, and yet they are all

520
00:24:00.813 --> 00:24:03.732
so easily explained when you realize

521
00:24:03.732 --> 00:24:05.333
we're in a binary system.

522
00:24:05.333 --> 00:24:06.732
It explains all the motions.

523
00:24:06.732 --> 00:24:09.193
<v ->So, that means we have to unloose our own</v>

524
00:24:09.193 --> 00:24:12.572
bind to, that, what do you call them?

525
00:24:12.572 --> 00:24:14.432
When you're chained to something?

526
00:24:14.432 --> 00:24:15.152
Anyway, we have to--

527
00:24:15.152 --> 00:24:15.953
<v ->Be bound.</v>

528
00:24:15.953 --> 00:24:18.233
<v ->We have to unloose that, unloose our own boundaries</v>

529
00:24:18.233 --> 00:24:21.352
of our thinking from the Newtonian science

530
00:24:21.352 --> 00:24:23.073
into something brand new.

531
00:24:23.073 --> 00:24:25.464
<v ->Yes, I think it's time.</v>

532
00:24:27.352 --> 00:24:28.912
<v ->We'll be staying in touch with Walter,</v>

533
00:24:28.912 --> 00:24:30.992
and we'll keep you updated as more breakthroughs

534
00:24:30.992 --> 00:24:33.572
on the astrophysics and mathematic scenes

535
00:24:33.572 --> 00:24:34.792
are made available.

536
00:24:34.792 --> 00:24:36.332
Meanwhile, please take a look at our interview

537
00:24:36.332 --> 00:24:38.472
with John Major Jenkins, to go deeper

538
00:24:38.472 --> 00:24:40.773
into the Mayans, and their understanding

539
00:24:40.773 --> 00:24:42.632
of the Precession of the Equinox.

540
00:24:42.632 --> 00:24:45.003
Until next time, thanks for watching.
