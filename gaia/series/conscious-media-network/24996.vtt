00:00:00.656 --> 00:00:03.094
<v Regina Meredith>Sai Maa is the top ranked female guru</v>

2
00:00:03.094 --> 00:00:07.169
in the world, having earned the esteemed title of Jagadguru.

3
00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:10.095
As Spiritual Master dedicated to global enlightenment,

4
00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:13.405
Sai Maa is particularly aware of the deep need for

5
00:00:13.405 --> 00:00:16.259
personal awareness among the female population,

6
00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:19.109
whom she says, is still attached to the notion

7
00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.437
of pain and suffering.

8
00:00:22.917 --> 00:00:24.821 line:15% 
(atmospheric theme music)

9
00:00:26.948 --> 00:00:29.581
<v Regina>We're doing this for an online audience</v>

10
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:32.089
and this is something that you have lectured on

11
00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:35.258
because I, I'm assuming you find this very important.

12
00:00:35.258 --> 00:00:40.135
The integration of the spirituality and modern technology

13
00:00:40.135 --> 00:00:41.516
and I love the title of this,

14
00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:44.570
"Religion and Modem Civilization."

15
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.741
Can you talk a little bit about your perception

16
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:48.703
of how these are blending now?

17
00:00:50.723 --> 00:00:52.843
<v Sai>Blessings to all of you.</v>

18
00:00:54.898 --> 00:00:58.771
Modern civilization, actually there's nothing modern.

19
00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:01.091
There's nothing new.

20
00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:05.752
For this time and this several centuries ago,

21
00:01:05.752 --> 00:01:08.045
we are thinking it's new.

22
00:01:08.457 --> 00:01:10.024
Now what is becoming new?

23
00:01:10.024 --> 00:01:12.961
When I say technology, when I say modern,

24
00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:17.336
the computer technology has taken over.

25
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:23.329
We use to live in forests, we used to live with animals,

26
00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.104
we used to live with nature.

27
00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:29.715
And the grace of Mother Divine.

28
00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:31.444
The grace of the elements.

29
00:01:31.444 --> 00:01:33.895
The grace of Mother Earth.

30
00:01:34.615 --> 00:01:36.675
And we left all this

31
00:01:36.675 --> 00:01:39.745
for what we call the modern world.

32
00:01:39.885 --> 00:01:42.239
The modern world make us realize

33
00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:44.959
and bring to awareness

34
00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:47.659
that we are like machines.

35
00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.039
We are becoming machines.

36
00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:55.036
From this awareness of being machines,

37
00:01:55.036 --> 00:01:58.784
we start to realize we're not satisfied.

38
00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:03.403
We are not satisfied by having millions of dollars,

39
00:02:03.813 --> 00:02:08.813
cars, works, children, husbands, wives, whatever.

40
00:02:09.548 --> 00:02:10.740
Buildings.

41
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.125
Which is taking us into a deeper of us,

42
00:02:15.795 --> 00:02:18.053
who we really are.

43
00:02:19.893 --> 00:02:22.226
So I am very pleased to see

44
00:02:22.226 --> 00:02:25.247
that so-called modern civilization.

45
00:02:26.727 --> 00:02:29.100
For those who remember Atlantis,

46
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.973
for those who remember Lemuria,

47
00:02:31.973 --> 00:02:34.167
for those who remember ancient Egypt,

48
00:02:34.167 --> 00:02:36.779
and all the different dimension.

49
00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:38.169
There's nothing.

50
00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.256
Absolutely nothing.

51
00:02:41.446 --> 00:02:43.641
This is not powerful yet.

52
00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:45.754
<v Regina>No, the technology is not powerful</v>

53
00:02:45.754 --> 00:02:47.630
compared to those times.

54
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.320
<v ->Yes.</v>

55
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.723
<v Regina>But it's new for us in these times.</v>

56
00:02:51.453 --> 00:02:55.053
Do you see it as a double-edged sword, as they say?

57
00:02:55.053 --> 00:02:58.571
Both something that can transmit beauty,

58
00:02:58.571 --> 00:03:02.101
and also, an extension, almost

59
00:03:02.101 --> 00:03:04.446
a part of the problem as well.

60
00:03:04.446 --> 00:03:07.785
<v ->You see, the gift to this planet is</v>

61
00:03:07.785 --> 00:03:09.815
freedom, free will.

62
00:03:10.925 --> 00:03:13.316
We are free to use a knife to kill,

63
00:03:13.316 --> 00:03:17.019
we are free to use a knife to peel a vegetables or fruit.

64
00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.922
Or to get something with discernment.

65
00:03:19.922 --> 00:03:23.730
So because of free will, the planet is where it is now.

66
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.420
Nevertheless,

67
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.500
it is a golden opportunity to change.

68
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.295
It is a time where Karma of Mother Earth

69
00:03:34.295 --> 00:03:37.209
is coming to an end so she can ascend

70
00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.112
to a higher frequency and dimension.

71
00:03:40.112 --> 00:03:43.339
It is an opportunity for all human beings

72
00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:46.308
to allow the darkness within

73
00:03:46.308 --> 00:03:48.728
to be transformed into light.

74
00:03:49.668 --> 00:03:53.254
To really dare to shift, to change,

75
00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:55.692
to become a better human being.

76
00:03:55.692 --> 00:03:58.568
To simply become a human being.

77
00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:01.532
That's the great opportunity.

78
00:04:01.532 --> 00:04:04.941
It's fabulous to be on the planet right now.

79
00:04:05.201 --> 00:04:09.508
<v Regina>And I think, perhaps, we lose sight en masse</v>

80
00:04:09.508 --> 00:04:14.028
that we've all chosen to be here at this time

81
00:04:14.028 --> 00:04:15.650
for this opportunity.

82
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.008
<v ->Correct.</v>

83
00:04:17.008 --> 00:04:20.154
<v Regina>And this is something, how do you speak to this</v>

84
00:04:20.154 --> 00:04:21.954
for people who feel in despair because

85
00:04:21.954 --> 00:04:26.157
they look around them and say the dark's winning?

86
00:04:26.157 --> 00:04:27.332
<v ->Correct.</v>

87
00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:31.393
The teaching that I choose to bring on this planet

88
00:04:31.393 --> 00:04:34.261
is not to blame anyone.

89
00:04:34.261 --> 00:04:35.949
Not even oneself.

90
00:04:37.929 --> 00:04:40.031
To become aware.

91
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:41.842
Awareness is the key.

92
00:04:41.842 --> 00:04:45.337
Awareness is a mantra.

93
00:04:45.337 --> 00:04:48.239
Be aware what's happening.

94
00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:50.050
Do not blame anybody.

95
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.815
Do not judge anyone.

96
00:04:51.815 --> 00:04:53.754
Not even ourself.

97
00:04:53.754 --> 00:04:57.283
And from becoming aware, this awareness take us of,

98
00:04:58.513 --> 00:05:00.360
who am I?

99
00:05:00.395 --> 00:05:02.955
Where do I come from?

100
00:05:04.462 --> 00:05:06.687
Where do I go from here?

101
00:05:06.687 --> 00:05:08.673
Am I this body?

102
00:05:08.673 --> 00:05:10.443
Am I the mind?

103
00:05:11.563 --> 00:05:13.152
Awareness.

104
00:05:13.932 --> 00:05:17.380
<v Regina>I was reading in some of your materials</v>

105
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.540
that, it was a speech you had given

106
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.115
and you were talking about the fact that it's not important

107
00:05:23.115 --> 00:05:27.249
that we all study a religion or learn the deepest meditation

108
00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:28.688
and so forth.

109
00:05:28.688 --> 00:05:32.196
That being in the moment

110
00:05:32.196 --> 00:05:33.756
is our task at hand.

111
00:05:35.866 --> 00:05:37.779
And this feeds into it what you were saying a moment ago,

112
00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:40.693
I assume, is to simply be totally present.

113
00:05:40.693 --> 00:05:43.363
How do you define being totally present?

114
00:05:43.363 --> 00:05:45.697
<v ->Meaning you are aware of what's happening</v>

115
00:05:45.697 --> 00:05:47.636
right here, right now.

116
00:05:47.636 --> 00:05:50.470
The mind is not in the past.

117
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.660
With all the regrets, with all the whatever it's called.

118
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.179
Or it's not in the future, wishing, hoping, all the time,

119
00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:03.869
out of this body, out of here, out of the mind.

120
00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:05.924
Somewhere else.

121
00:06:05.924 --> 00:06:10.098
Here and now means awareness of what's happening.

122
00:06:10.998 --> 00:06:12.458
Awareness.

123
00:06:12.948 --> 00:06:15.433
<v Regina>And yet, this seems to be the biggest challenge</v>

124
00:06:15.433 --> 00:06:19.438
for humanity to just be present in the moment.

125
00:06:19.438 --> 00:06:22.015
<v ->This is simply because,</v>

126
00:06:23.755 --> 00:06:25.435
instead of thinking,

127
00:06:25.435 --> 00:06:28.150
human allow themself to be thought.

128
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.375
Do you understand that?

129
00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:32.279
<v Regina>I believe I understand.</v>

130
00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:34.787
Can you explain for my benefit and everybody else's

131
00:06:34.787 --> 00:06:36.087
in some more detail?

132
00:06:36.087 --> 00:06:40.677
<v ->Meaning that we become victim of the thoughts.</v>

133
00:06:41.427 --> 00:06:43.587
We as the personality.

134
00:06:44.917 --> 00:06:47.667
The way to - when we become aware,

135
00:06:47.667 --> 00:06:49.612
the real words become,

136
00:06:49.612 --> 00:06:51.822
"I decide what I think of.

137
00:06:52.942 --> 00:06:57.190
I do not let the thoughts to make of me a victim.

138
00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.367
I, the personality, is not a slave of the thoughts.

139
00:07:01.887 --> 00:07:04.715
I choose my thoughts.

140
00:07:04.715 --> 00:07:06.855
I am the master."

141
00:07:06.855 --> 00:07:11.596
The I is the great I Am, the great presence within us.

142
00:07:12.046 --> 00:07:14.227
Beyond religion.

143
00:07:14.227 --> 00:07:15.524
<v Regina>Beyond all religion.</v>

144
00:07:15.524 --> 00:07:17.025
Spirit.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

145
00:07:17.025 --> 00:07:20.897
And you address women very specifically

146
00:07:20.897 --> 00:07:24.194
and you speak of the nobility of the woman.

147
00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.969
And in looking at that, one of the things

148
00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:29.976
you have stated and keyed in on,

149
00:07:29.976 --> 00:07:32.344
which certainly seems to very be true,

150
00:07:33.094 --> 00:07:36.351
is women take themselves out of that presence all the time

151
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:39.862
and buy into, to a large extent,

152
00:07:39.862 --> 00:07:44.523
into the feelings and the vibration of pain and suffering.

153
00:07:45.183 --> 00:07:46.694
Can you talk about that?

154
00:07:46.694 --> 00:07:49.829
Why do you address women in particular about this subject?

155
00:07:49.829 --> 00:07:53.765
<v ->First, I have a feeling I took incarnation for women.</v>

156
00:07:55.905 --> 00:07:58.865
Women has a power,

157
00:07:58.865 --> 00:08:01.025
a quality in them

158
00:08:01.025 --> 00:08:03.212
that most of them are not aware.

159
00:08:03.642 --> 00:08:04.642
Most.

160
00:08:06.172 --> 00:08:10.080
Women has, for centuries, created themself

161
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.572
in that place where they have to have a superior.

162
00:08:16.012 --> 00:08:18.424
And most of the time, their spouse, or partners

163
00:08:18.424 --> 00:08:21.421
or father, brothers,

164
00:08:22.031 --> 00:08:23.990
forgetting themself.

165
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.261
Now at the same time, it goes together

166
00:08:26.261 --> 00:08:30.836
with the Karma of Mother Earth herself.

167
00:08:30.836 --> 00:08:35.277
Mother Earth being a divine feminine principle,

168
00:08:35.967 --> 00:08:38.565
has gone asleep

169
00:08:39.079 --> 00:08:40.757
for centuries.

170
00:08:42.306 --> 00:08:44.981
And now it's her time.

171
00:08:45.743 --> 00:08:48.413
Now her sacredness is coming out.

172
00:08:48.413 --> 00:08:51.722
Now she's vomiting all the stuff

173
00:08:51.722 --> 00:08:53.574
that we have put into her.

174
00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:55.710
We have killed her.

175
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:58.859
She's struggling to exist.

176
00:08:58.859 --> 00:09:00.696
The same thing is happening to women

177
00:09:00.696 --> 00:09:04.597
as they both work together, and on the same principle.

178
00:09:04.597 --> 00:09:08.104
This feminine shakti, energy.

179
00:09:08.104 --> 00:09:12.736
So that - why do I say women are so powerful?

180
00:09:12.736 --> 00:09:16.248
Because you give the same task to a man

181
00:09:16.248 --> 00:09:17.818
and then to a woman,

182
00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:21.281
the woman is stronger but will think that

183
00:09:21.281 --> 00:09:25.786
she's less stronger than the man, which is not the case.

184
00:09:25.786 --> 00:09:28.386
The man will really say, "I'm tired."

185
00:09:28.386 --> 00:09:31.334
And the woman will continue to do the work.

186
00:09:32.554 --> 00:09:34.519
I have faith in women.

187
00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:37.333
I know it's possible.

188
00:09:38.673 --> 00:09:41.074
That emotional body

189
00:09:41.074 --> 00:09:44.054
has not been educated

190
00:09:44.054 --> 00:09:47.363
to be strong and stand in their truth.

191
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.469
It's all about the emotional body.

192
00:09:49.469 --> 00:09:50.317
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

193
00:09:51.427 --> 00:09:55.446
<v ->And the man has been educated to be mentally strong.</v>

194
00:09:57.411 --> 00:10:01.254
So the woman has the tendency to use emotional body

195
00:10:01.254 --> 00:10:03.588
and men, mental body.

196
00:10:03.588 --> 00:10:05.614
So balance is needed.

197
00:10:07.024 --> 00:10:08.162
<v Regina>For both.</v>

198
00:10:08.162 --> 00:10:09.300
<v ->Naturally.</v>

199
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.916
<v Regina>How, what do you suggest as a beginning point</v>

200
00:10:14.106 --> 00:10:18.506
for the women who are attached to the notion

201
00:10:18.506 --> 00:10:21.497
of sacrifice, suffering, pain?

202
00:10:23.432 --> 00:10:25.275
It's a trap.

203
00:10:25.775 --> 00:10:27.731
<v ->There's no need for pain.</v>

204
00:10:28.584 --> 00:10:30.401
No need for suffering.

205
00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.840
Each woman can take a moment,

206
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.086
be in stillness and breathe.

207
00:10:37.326 --> 00:10:41.419
And breathe the ecstasy of their own essence.

208
00:10:42.126 --> 00:10:43.194
Ecstasy.

209
00:10:43.194 --> 00:10:45.674
In that ecstasy is the power.

210
00:10:46.004 --> 00:10:50.216
That love, that divine infinite love.

211
00:10:52.076 --> 00:10:54.463
in which there's everything.

212
00:10:55.083 --> 00:10:59.054
Take a moment every day, just sit in stillness.

213
00:10:59.054 --> 00:11:02.322
Lay down a moment for oneself.

214
00:11:04.452 --> 00:11:09.235
From that moment, the whole creation within will appear,

215
00:11:09.955 --> 00:11:12.840
will reveal Herself.

216
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.702
<v Regina>And you have developed a ways</v>

217
00:11:15.702 --> 00:11:17.455
in which to reach out to women.

218
00:11:17.455 --> 00:11:20.428
You have a beautiful book, "Petals of Grace."

219
00:11:20.428 --> 00:11:22.900
You also have something I love,

220
00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.292
I came across a couple of months ago.

221
00:11:25.832 --> 00:11:30.064
Which is the "Brain Illumination" DVD

222
00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:32.386
and I want to get into the meat of that subject.

223
00:11:32.386 --> 00:11:35.648
Because it's a very direct segue way.

224
00:11:35.648 --> 00:11:39.755
It seems that if one can begin utilizing these tools,

225
00:11:39.755 --> 00:11:41.892
<v Regina>the ability</v>
<v ->Correct.</v>

226
00:11:41.892 --> 00:11:43.088
<v Regina>to go in and connect</v>

227
00:11:43.088 --> 00:11:46.199
with one's personal ecstasy is so much more accessible.

228
00:11:46.869 --> 00:11:48.962
Can we talk about that DVD?

229
00:11:48.962 --> 00:11:51.435
And about the - you're literally looking at things

230
00:11:51.435 --> 00:11:54.907
that science right now, through technology and devices,

231
00:11:54.907 --> 00:11:56.404
are trying to reach.

232
00:11:56.404 --> 00:11:59.202
And you're doing it through pure consciousness.

233
00:12:00.102 --> 00:12:02.976
Can you tell me about the journey of creating that

234
00:12:02.976 --> 00:12:05.843
and what it is in ancient terms, modern,

235
00:12:05.843 --> 00:12:09.802
and why we must start balancing these brains of ours?

236
00:12:09.802 --> 00:12:13.158
<v ->Let's start with my relationship with my Master.</v>

237
00:12:14.318 --> 00:12:17.759
Every time my Master will touch my head, there'll be light.

238
00:12:17.759 --> 00:12:20.530
My eyes will close and I'll see the light.

239
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:21.331
<v Regina>Sai Baba.</v>

240
00:12:21.331 --> 00:12:24.733
<v ->Mmhmm. So the light, the light, the light.</v>

241
00:12:24.733 --> 00:12:27.730
And I realized that enlightenment

242
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.938
has a complete thing,

243
00:12:29.938 --> 00:12:31.628
versus the love, of course.

244
00:12:31.628 --> 00:12:33.707
The devotion, the bhakti.

245
00:12:33.707 --> 00:12:35.715
And the light from the brain.

246
00:12:35.715 --> 00:12:38.978
In the brain, there is the third ventrical,

247
00:12:38.978 --> 00:12:41.915
which we call also, the Cave of Brahma.

248
00:12:41.915 --> 00:12:44.156
And when this is being activated,

249
00:12:44.156 --> 00:12:46.814
the lights come out of there.

250
00:12:46.814 --> 00:12:49.493
As we also have the pineal gland.

251
00:12:49.493 --> 00:12:53.031
And into the esoteric work of ancient time,

252
00:12:53.031 --> 00:12:56.724
then we'll call this the sahasraha chakra,

253
00:12:57.594 --> 00:12:59.980
where the eternal is.

254
00:13:01.704 --> 00:13:05.047
<v Regina>And other portions, specifically hold our fears,</v>

255
00:13:05.047 --> 00:13:06.370
our memories and our pain.

256
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.440
<v ->Correct.</v>

257
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.635
<v Regina>Can you talk about that?</v>

258
00:13:08.635 --> 00:13:10.816
Talk about the complex way in which

259
00:13:10.816 --> 00:13:12.976
our brain is functioning.

260
00:13:14.056 --> 00:13:16.946
<v ->On this planet, there are two energies.</v>

261
00:13:16.946 --> 00:13:19.350
One is love, one is fear.

262
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.369
The love is an expanded energy.

263
00:13:23.959 --> 00:13:27.255
The fear, a contracted energy.

264
00:13:27.535 --> 00:13:30.351
The love that each human carry,

265
00:13:30.351 --> 00:13:32.791
is infinite, endless.

266
00:13:33.361 --> 00:13:37.496
So powerful, that we can love the whole creation

267
00:13:37.496 --> 00:13:39.348
with no condition.

268
00:13:40.137 --> 00:13:44.381
The fear is also this birth of this incarnation

269
00:13:44.381 --> 00:13:47.678
as well as from other birth.

270
00:13:47.678 --> 00:13:48.549
What does that mean?

271
00:13:48.549 --> 00:13:51.149
That means that when the body, when the soul

272
00:13:51.149 --> 00:13:54.884
leaves the body, the body stays here and,

273
00:13:55.554 --> 00:13:57.686
how happen what happens to it.

274
00:13:57.686 --> 00:13:59.364
But there's energy.

275
00:14:00.214 --> 00:14:04.362
What we're creating here exists as energy.

276
00:14:04.362 --> 00:14:06.173
We may see two bodies, but actually

277
00:14:06.173 --> 00:14:08.007
there are no two bodies.

278
00:14:08.007 --> 00:14:09.702
But there's an energy.

279
00:14:09.702 --> 00:14:13.127
So this energy, when it's a divine energy,

280
00:14:13.127 --> 00:14:17.405
a godly energy, it goes and melt

281
00:14:17.405 --> 00:14:19.615
and become one whole.

282
00:14:19.615 --> 00:14:22.647
And also the same thing for the fear-based energy.

283
00:14:22.647 --> 00:14:25.956
It goes into the fear energy bag.

284
00:14:26.406 --> 00:14:28.789
When we take incarnation again,

285
00:14:28.789 --> 00:14:31.065
you may wonder that sometimes

286
00:14:31.065 --> 00:14:35.082
you see a beautiful child, infant.

287
00:14:35.592 --> 00:14:38.704
And a few years ago, they become quite bad.

288
00:14:38.704 --> 00:14:40.010
You aware of that?

289
00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:45.797
So this energy that we have left last birth comes back.

290
00:14:46.007 --> 00:14:50.270
We carry that and put it in this body, in the brain,

291
00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:52.394
as a seed.

292
00:14:53.774 --> 00:14:55.518
The seed of Karma.

293
00:14:56.688 --> 00:14:59.648
And it will grow at a certain age, it will grow

294
00:14:59.648 --> 00:15:03.096
like these little bodies, the seed will grow.

295
00:15:03.526 --> 00:15:05.571
And when it grows, what happens is

296
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:08.367
they are all fear-based, waiting in the brain

297
00:15:08.367 --> 00:15:11.485
to be activated by situations.

298
00:15:11.734 --> 00:15:15.693
When this light, what I've created with this light

299
00:15:15.693 --> 00:15:18.700
that my Guru gave me regularly,

300
00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:20.546
is a diksha.

301
00:15:20.546 --> 00:15:23.042
A diksha means, simply, an initiation.

302
00:15:23.562 --> 00:15:27.199
The name of this diksha is called

303
00:15:27.199 --> 00:15:29.779
Ananda, ecstasy.

304
00:15:31.019 --> 00:15:32.017
Bliss.

305
00:15:32.017 --> 00:15:33.619
Joti, light.

306
00:15:33.619 --> 00:15:34.921
Diksha.

307
00:15:35.221 --> 00:15:38.162
So when we start giving diksha,

308
00:15:39.122 --> 00:15:41.235
that light, that energy, that shakti,

309
00:15:41.235 --> 00:15:43.419
goes into the brain

310
00:15:43.419 --> 00:15:46.639
and start to melt the seeds of fear.

311
00:15:49.219 --> 00:15:52.741
<v Regina>This is very, very interesting and very profound.</v>

312
00:15:52.741 --> 00:15:55.815
And it dovetails perfectly with what is known about

313
00:15:55.815 --> 00:15:59.147
some emerging scientific technologies

314
00:15:59.147 --> 00:16:01.945
and the same exact words are coming up

315
00:16:01.945 --> 00:16:04.136
through the experiencers.

316
00:16:04.786 --> 00:16:07.526
And so these truths are eternal.

317
00:16:07.526 --> 00:16:08.292
<v ->Exactly.</v>

318
00:16:08.292 --> 00:16:12.089
Now in the brain, also, is the Law of Forgiveness,

319
00:16:12.089 --> 00:16:13.958
as well as the Law of Life.

320
00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.847
It is, it is inside,

321
00:16:16.847 --> 00:16:19.397
just simply awaits to be awakened.

322
00:16:20.197 --> 00:16:23.199
So when the Law of Forgiveness, with the light,

323
00:16:23.199 --> 00:16:26.016
with the love from the depth,

324
00:16:26.016 --> 00:16:27.906
the center, the essence

325
00:16:27.906 --> 00:16:29.875
of our being all come together,

326
00:16:29.875 --> 00:16:32.157
it's absolutely magnificent.

327
00:16:32.418 --> 00:16:34.775
<v Regina>And why did you decide to go into this format,</v>

328
00:16:34.775 --> 00:16:37.548
which by the way, is absolutely magnificent.

329
00:16:37.548 --> 00:16:40.617
I applaud you and your team of graphic designers

330
00:16:40.617 --> 00:16:43.522
and everyone it took to bring this DVD to life.

331
00:16:43.522 --> 00:16:47.330
Because it truly takes you into, well for me,

332
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.199
an altered state almost instantly.

333
00:16:49.199 --> 00:16:52.136
But in addition to that, it gives the mind

334
00:16:52.136 --> 00:16:54.737
the understanding of what each aspect

335
00:16:54.737 --> 00:16:57.105
of the brain looks like, where it's located,

336
00:16:57.105 --> 00:16:59.300
how you bring the light in.

337
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.489
How did you go about this?

338
00:17:01.489 --> 00:17:05.622
<v ->It's, again, has to do with my experience with my Master.</v>

339
00:17:05.813 --> 00:17:08.715
And the next thing I could add to that is

340
00:17:10.835 --> 00:17:13.812
it is time for global enlightnment.

341
00:17:13.812 --> 00:17:17.310
Enlightenment used to be a secret teaching.

342
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:19.823
Knowledge of ancient time.

343
00:17:20.233 --> 00:17:22.125
Wisdom, hidden wisdom.

344
00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:23.936
This time is over.

345
00:17:23.936 --> 00:17:27.942
Now it's time for every single human being

346
00:17:28.242 --> 00:17:32.469
to realize they are enlightened beings.

347
00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:35.337
Not aware, but enlightened beings.

348
00:17:35.337 --> 00:17:40.144
And this same DVD, I tell you 21 days you watch this DVD,

349
00:17:40.144 --> 00:17:41.920
transformation will happen.

350
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:45.357
Whether you have a master in your life or not.

351
00:17:45.357 --> 00:17:46.994
<v Regina>I absolutely believe that.</v>

352
00:17:46.994 --> 00:17:48.140
It's very powerful.

353
00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:52.497
<v ->Every single person has to be self-guru now.</v>

354
00:17:52.497 --> 00:17:56.665
Not to wait for a master to come and give their darshan,

355
00:17:56.665 --> 00:18:00.410
their divine presence, but be a master.

356
00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.442
Be the freedom that we yearn for.

357
00:18:03.782 --> 00:18:06.577
The freedom is why, why no pain ,

358
00:18:06.577 --> 00:18:08.697
no suffering any more.

359
00:18:09.197 --> 00:18:11.844
That's the meaning of freedom.

360
00:18:11.844 --> 00:18:14.514
It's not about, "I can do whatever I want."

361
00:18:14.514 --> 00:18:17.794
Be free from lower frequency,

362
00:18:17.794 --> 00:18:19.984
lower emotion energy.

363
00:18:20.674 --> 00:18:22.328
<v Regina>Because not everybody's going to have access</v>

364
00:18:22.328 --> 00:18:23.748
to you
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

365
00:18:23.748 --> 00:18:25.927
<v Regina>or your, the people that you have taught,</v>

366
00:18:25.927 --> 00:18:27.692
the masters at diksha.

367
00:18:27.692 --> 00:18:29.027
They're not going to have access to this,

368
00:18:29.027 --> 00:18:31.411
so we really need to take it into our own hands.

369
00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:32.137
<v ->Global.</v>

370
00:18:32.137 --> 00:18:33.207
<v Regina>Global.</v>

371
00:18:33.207 --> 00:18:34.437
<v ->Global enlightenment.</v>

372
00:18:34.437 --> 00:18:37.511
In the 21st century, it's possible.

373
00:18:37.511 --> 00:18:40.240
And we have no choice, actually.

374
00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.107
<v Regina>What are you seeing as you move through life</v>

375
00:18:43.107 --> 00:18:44.408
and around the globe?

376
00:18:44.408 --> 00:18:45.511
You travel a lot.

377
00:18:45.511 --> 00:18:48.355
You have a lot of people that gather around you.

378
00:18:48.355 --> 00:18:50.921
What are you seeing in terms of shifts

379
00:18:50.921 --> 00:18:53.185
or changes that are taking place?

380
00:18:54.195 --> 00:18:57.650
<v ->I see that everybody has a choiceless choice.</v>

381
00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.096
<v Regina>A choiceless choice.</v>

382
00:19:00.096 --> 00:19:01.053
<v ->Yes.</v>

383
00:19:01.053 --> 00:19:02.703
What's happening is that

384
00:19:04.213 --> 00:19:06.003
because the planet Herself

385
00:19:06.003 --> 00:19:08.600
is shifting, nobody has any choice.

386
00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.865
Whoever lives on the planet has to shift.

387
00:19:12.245 --> 00:19:14.475
And so much light is coming from

388
00:19:14.475 --> 00:19:17.110
many different part of the galaxy.

389
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:20.210
So the light is touching the heart of people,

390
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:21.812
the brain of people.

391
00:19:21.812 --> 00:19:24.842
Now the other thing that makes the shift happen faster

392
00:19:24.842 --> 00:19:26.781
is disease.

393
00:19:26.781 --> 00:19:28.755
Dis-ease.

394
00:19:28.755 --> 00:19:30.125
Illness.

395
00:19:30.125 --> 00:19:31.889
When someone has age in the family,

396
00:19:31.889 --> 00:19:33.434
everybody get together.

397
00:19:33.434 --> 00:19:34.870
The heart's open.

398
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:39.239
Cause the material world can not love.

399
00:19:39.239 --> 00:19:42.629
The material world can not meditate.

400
00:19:42.629 --> 00:19:46.030
The material world can not say, "Be still,

401
00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:49.897
Know I am God."

402
00:19:51.644 --> 00:19:53.601
It's each heart.

403
00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:58.653
The heart chakra that every single human carry,

404
00:19:58.653 --> 00:20:00.415
has two component:

405
00:20:00.725 --> 00:20:03.525
one is, the human love

406
00:20:03.525 --> 00:20:06.069
with attachment, with pain, with suffering,

407
00:20:06.069 --> 00:20:09.558
and sensation of depression.

408
00:20:09.558 --> 00:20:10.463
<v Regina>Drama.</v>

409
00:20:10.463 --> 00:20:11.787
<v ->Drama. Thank you.</v>

410
00:20:11.787 --> 00:20:13.331
Great word.

411
00:20:13.331 --> 00:20:16.977
And the other component is that univeral love.

412
00:20:16.977 --> 00:20:21.088
That no matter what, we keep loving each other.

413
00:20:21.748 --> 00:20:23.316
<v Regina>Like the color you have on,</v>

414
00:20:23.876 --> 00:20:27.913
that is a representative of that universal love, isn't it?

415
00:20:27.913 --> 00:20:31.048
That beautiful pinky coral.

416
00:20:31.048 --> 00:20:34.148
And it is, it's a representation that light, that warmth.

417
00:20:34.148 --> 00:20:35.878
That beauty.

418
00:20:35.878 --> 00:20:37.816
<v ->Beauty's essential.</v>

419
00:20:37.816 --> 00:20:42.138
You see, some people are shocked when they see beauty

420
00:20:42.638 --> 00:20:44.028
around masters.

421
00:20:44.748 --> 00:20:47.604
When your consciousness, human consciousness

422
00:20:47.604 --> 00:20:50.010
has shift from a limited,

423
00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.871
a limited pattern.

424
00:20:54.871 --> 00:20:58.271
When the whole consciousness has moved into a

425
00:20:58.271 --> 00:21:00.447
heavenly life,

426
00:21:01.227 --> 00:21:03.477
everything is about beauty.

427
00:21:04.147 --> 00:21:06.857
Beauty. Beauty.

428
00:21:06.857 --> 00:21:10.828
Allow each heart to express its beauty.

429
00:21:10.828 --> 00:21:13.162
Allow each heart to move into that,

430
00:21:13.162 --> 00:21:16.599
that beautifying place within.

431
00:21:18.096 --> 00:21:20.232
<v Regina>And this means</v>
<v ->Everything!</v>

432
00:21:20.232 --> 00:21:21.974
<v Regina>having expressions of beauty around you, in you.</v>

433
00:21:21.974 --> 00:21:22.902
<v ->Correct.</v>

434
00:21:22.902 --> 00:21:24.203
Yes, yes.

435
00:21:24.203 --> 00:21:26.478
Dare to be dressed beautifly.

436
00:21:26.478 --> 00:21:28.615
Dare to have beauty in your life.

437
00:21:28.615 --> 00:21:32.341
Dare to allow prosperity with beauty to enter

438
00:21:32.341 --> 00:21:35.650
and beautify you experience of life on Planet Earth.

439
00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:38.292
There's no reason to be poor.

440
00:21:38.872 --> 00:21:39.611
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

441
00:21:39.611 --> 00:21:41.084
<v ->God is not poor.</v>

442
00:21:41.084 --> 00:21:42.953
Look at nature.

443
00:21:42.953 --> 00:21:44.996
Nature's magnificent beauty.

444
00:21:44.996 --> 00:21:48.201
Look at a simple flower after the winter.

445
00:21:48.201 --> 00:21:49.844
Such beauty.

446
00:21:49.861 --> 00:21:51.231
Such abundance.

447
00:21:51.231 --> 00:21:54.116
That's the life of every human being.

448
00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:58.673
<v Regina>I wanted to ask you one more question</v>

449
00:21:58.673 --> 00:22:01.575
because I know you have a lot of people waiting for you.

450
00:22:01.575 --> 00:22:04.118
You're going to be presenting this evening.

451
00:22:04.118 --> 00:22:07.253
And that is on the subject of slience.

452
00:22:07.253 --> 00:22:10.248
And the value and beauty of silence,

453
00:22:10.248 --> 00:22:13.383
which is, of course, very difficult for the Western world.

454
00:22:13.383 --> 00:22:16.726
Can you talk about silence for one moment?

455
00:22:18.236 --> 00:22:20.265
<v ->Silence come from</v>

456
00:22:21.185 --> 00:22:23.555
the womb of creation itself.

457
00:22:23.555 --> 00:22:26.859
Out of silence, everything is created.

458
00:22:28.139 --> 00:22:29.493
Together with that,

459
00:22:29.493 --> 00:22:33.573
there is a fantastic great cosmic being

460
00:22:33.573 --> 00:22:36.510
whose name is The Great Silent Watcher,

461
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:38.274
with whom I work.

462
00:22:38.274 --> 00:22:41.154
That's on the esoteric part.

463
00:22:41.154 --> 00:22:44.138
When I became Mahamandaleshwar

464
00:22:44.718 --> 00:22:47.622
in Kashi, or Varanasi Banaras,

465
00:22:47.622 --> 00:22:51.365
the guru who gave me this title

466
00:22:53.115 --> 00:22:54.925
also keeps silence.

467
00:22:54.925 --> 00:22:57.804
But receive a direct message from his guru

468
00:22:57.804 --> 00:22:59.731
who is no more on this planet.

469
00:23:00.651 --> 00:23:03.772
And now this actual guru, his name is Satwa Baba,

470
00:23:03.772 --> 00:23:06.210
he is 95 years old now,

471
00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:08.845
and he told me one day,

472
00:23:08.845 --> 00:23:12.142
"Now my guru's asking that you take silence

473
00:23:12.142 --> 00:23:14.952
because you are part of that lineage.

474
00:23:14.952 --> 00:23:17.960
So every day I am in that silence.

475
00:23:18.256 --> 00:23:19.918
Until three or sometime,

476
00:23:19.918 --> 00:23:22.864
I have a tendency to extend it,

477
00:23:23.544 --> 00:23:25.929
which doesn't make my assistant too happy.

478
00:23:27.299 --> 00:23:30.097
<v Regina>It would make communication challenging</v>

479
00:23:30.097 --> 00:23:31.038
at times.

480
00:23:31.038 --> 00:23:33.034
I would think my husband would love that,

481
00:23:33.034 --> 00:23:35.635
if I woud take the same observation.

482
00:23:35.635 --> 00:23:37.597
(laughing)

483
00:23:37.597 --> 00:23:39.745
<v ->There is a great power in silence.</v>

484
00:23:39.745 --> 00:23:41.742
A great power.

485
00:23:41.742 --> 00:23:44.819
In my case, it gave me an apportion to

486
00:23:44.819 --> 00:23:48.840
not to have to always talk around

487
00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.352
and move into the, the different dimensions

488
00:23:51.352 --> 00:23:53.006
and do the work.

489
00:23:53.627 --> 00:23:55.430
[ Regina] Do you spend a good amount of that morning time

490
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.412
and early afternoon in meditation,

491
00:23:57.412 --> 00:23:59.061
or doing what you need to do?

492
00:23:59.061 --> 00:24:02.926
<v ->I will say everything has become a meditation.</v>

493
00:24:03.556 --> 00:24:04.831
Everything.

494
00:24:04.831 --> 00:24:08.081
Speaking to you right now is meditation.

495
00:24:08.941 --> 00:24:11.466
Looking at a flower is meditation.

496
00:24:13.236 --> 00:24:15.762
Everything is meditation.

497
00:24:17.163 --> 00:24:20.748
<v Regina>Any final word before we say goodbye this time?</v>

498
00:24:21.588 --> 00:24:24.683
<v ->I would like to invite all of you to take</v>

499
00:24:24.683 --> 00:24:28.477
a moment of silence, stillness.

500
00:24:28.924 --> 00:24:31.809
And simply be aware of that breath.

501
00:24:32.419 --> 00:24:34.285
Without effort, just be aware.

502
00:24:34.285 --> 00:24:36.131
Do not do anything.

503
00:24:36.131 --> 00:24:39.428
For a moment, to stop to be a doer,

504
00:24:39.428 --> 00:24:42.393
and become a human being.

505
00:24:43.073 --> 00:24:45.535
And with that breath, just go deeper and deeper

506
00:24:45.535 --> 00:24:49.842
inside and find the treasure which awaits.

507
00:24:51.162 --> 00:24:54.521
This is a great time for divine feminine principle.

508
00:24:55.651 --> 00:25:00.136
I welcome all the women to step into themself.

509
00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.037
Find themself.

510
00:25:03.728 --> 00:25:05.812
Be in that bliss of who they are.

511
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:10.340
And be in touch with the sacredness that they carry.

512
00:25:11.553 --> 00:25:15.435
With great, great gratitude, with great love,

513
00:25:16.835 --> 00:25:18.373
I thank you.

514
00:25:18.373 --> 00:25:19.244
<v Regina>Thank you.</v>

515
00:25:19.244 --> 00:25:23.197
<v ->Om shanti shanti shanti.</v>

516
00:25:23.307 --> 00:25:26.065
Om ti ti ma.

517
00:25:28.242 --> 00:25:29.584
Thank you.

518
00:25:30.394 --> 00:25:32.344
(atmospheric music)

519
00:25:32.754 --> 00:25:34.858
<v ->If you go to humanityinunity.org,</v>

520
00:25:34.858 --> 00:25:37.923
you can find out where Sai Maa will be appearing next.

521
00:25:37.923 --> 00:25:41.197
And also, pick up a copy of her DVD, "Brain Illumination,"

522
00:25:41.197 --> 00:25:42.996
which we spoke of during the interview.

523
00:25:42.996 --> 00:25:44.761
I highly recommend it.

524
00:25:44.761 --> 00:25:47.004
Until next time, take a little time to breathe

525
00:25:47.004 --> 00:25:48.871
and spend a little time being quiet.

526
00:25:48.871 --> 00:25:50.473
Thanks for watching.

527
00:25:51.223 --> 00:25:55.321
(atmospheric music)
