00:00:00.052 --> 00:00:01.170
(lively piano music)

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.591
<v ->The world is in a fever over the mysteries embedded</v>

3
00:00:03.591 --> 00:00:06.888
in Leonardo da Vinci's work since a popular novel

4
00:00:06.888 --> 00:00:09.967
and now movie, have burst into modern culture.

5
00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:12.921
But for author Michael Gelb, Leonardo's work offers

6
00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:16.022
not only mystery, but a path to true unfoldment

7
00:00:16.022 --> 00:00:17.422
of our potential.

8
00:00:17.422 --> 00:00:19.762
As an innovator in the fields of creative thinking

9
00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:22.221
and leadership, Michael had a flourishing business

10
00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:25.362
consulting companies such as Microsoft and DuPont.

11
00:00:25.362 --> 00:00:29.336
Then came an invitation to speak in Florence, Italy in 1994.

12
00:00:29.336 --> 00:00:31.918
It was in researching for this event that Michael

13
00:00:31.918 --> 00:00:35.198
took his lifelong passion for the work of Leonardo da Vinci

14
00:00:35.198 --> 00:00:38.637
to a new level, and incorporated it into his work,

15
00:00:38.637 --> 00:00:41.617
How to Think like Leonardo da Vinci.

16
00:00:41.617 --> 00:00:46.047 line:15% 
(lively, bouncy music)

17
00:00:50.197 --> 00:00:53.000
Give us a little bit of background in how your interest

18
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.720
developed in Leonardo, and the building blocks

19
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.200
of what we know now to be life in creativity.

20
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.791
<v ->Well Leonardo is one of my childhood heroes,</v>

21
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:03.672
along with Superman.

22
00:01:03.672 --> 00:01:06.151
And I remember when I realized that Superman

23
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:09.451
was only a comic book character, but the good new is,

24
00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:11.361
Leonardo turned out to be real.

25
00:01:12.461 --> 00:01:15.319
And he seemed, always to embody for me,

26
00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:18.779
the essence of human potentiality,

27
00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:21.998
which was my total passion and fascination.

28
00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:23.080
<v Voiceover>Even as a child?</v>

29
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.878
<v ->Effectively yeah, and certainly as I went into high school</v>

30
00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:29.908
and college, graduate school,

31
00:01:30.778 --> 00:01:32.799
it never really occurred to me to have a real job.

32
00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.261
(laughter)

33
00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:35.920
<v Voiceover>I'm with you there.</v>

34
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.599
<v ->Right.</v>

35
00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:40.371
Instead, I just wanted to pursue

36
00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:43.135
truth, beauty, and goodness, which again,

37
00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:45.064
Leonardo seemed to embody.

38
00:01:45.892 --> 00:01:48.708
So for years I used him as an example in the seminars

39
00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:51.220
I taught around the world on creative thinking.

40
00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:54.129
Then, in the early 90s,

41
00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:57.785
I was speaking in Washington, D.C. to a group of company

42
00:01:57.785 --> 00:01:59.264
presidents.

43
00:01:59.264 --> 00:02:02.659
And I knew they were having an event in Florence,

44
00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.180
which is my favorite city,

45
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.338
and I wanted to get invited.

46
00:02:06.338 --> 00:02:09.418
So the head of the Education Committee

47
00:02:09.418 --> 00:02:12.768
for this Florence event came to my presentation in D.C.,

48
00:02:12.768 --> 00:02:15.558
and said, "If we were to invite you to Florence,

49
00:02:15.558 --> 00:02:16.157
"what would you do?

50
00:02:16.157 --> 00:02:18.283
"We'd want something really special."

51
00:02:18.283 --> 00:02:19.645
So I looked him right in the eye and I said,

52
00:02:19.645 --> 00:02:22.661
"How about how to think like Leonardo da Vinci?"

53
00:02:22.661 --> 00:02:24.340
And he said, "Can you really do that?"

54
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.765
And I said, "Sure."

55
00:02:25.765 --> 00:02:29.598
It's what we call the chutzpah principle of intelligence.

56
00:02:29.598 --> 00:02:33.388
And he said, "You're in."

57
00:02:33.388 --> 00:02:35.059
So I had six months to make it up.

58
00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:37.540
<v Voiceover>Hey well that was a pretty sexy lead</v>

59
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.220
to that guy.

60
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.080
That's perfect.

61
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.442
So, you made it up.

62
00:02:40.442 --> 00:02:40.982
Here we are.

63
00:02:40.982 --> 00:02:43.522
Now we're about a decade and a half into it.

64
00:02:43.522 --> 00:02:47.548
And so, at what point did you develop your,

65
00:02:47.548 --> 00:02:49.943
the book that has the seven steps

66
00:02:49.943 --> 00:02:51.591
to unlocking your creativity?

67
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:54.438
<v ->Well, that presentation set the stage for the book.</v>

68
00:02:54.438 --> 00:02:54.866
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

69
00:02:54.866 --> 00:02:56.655
<v ->I went to Leonardo's birthplace.</v>

70
00:02:56.655 --> 00:02:58.415
I went to the place he died.

71
00:02:58.415 --> 00:03:00.463
And I walked his footsteps,

72
00:03:00.463 --> 00:03:03.055
and looked at the world from his perspective.

73
00:03:03.055 --> 00:03:05.203
Immersed myself in his notebooks.

74
00:03:05.203 --> 00:03:08.314
I interviewed some of the top scholars in the world.

75
00:03:08.314 --> 00:03:12.487
I contemplated his artwork.

76
00:03:12.487 --> 00:03:14.966
I started dreaming about him.

77
00:03:14.966 --> 00:03:18.406
And from those dreams, these seven principles emerged.

78
00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:19.927
People say, "Did you come up with the number seven

79
00:03:19.927 --> 00:03:21.455
"'cause it's good for marketing?"

80
00:03:21.455 --> 00:03:22.083
(laughter)

81
00:03:22.083 --> 00:03:24.291
Magic number seven plus or minus two.

82
00:03:24.291 --> 00:03:25.491
But, no.

83
00:03:25.491 --> 00:03:27.997
I tried to find an eighth principle, I couldn't do it.

84
00:03:27.997 --> 00:03:29.643
I tried to consolidate down to six.

85
00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:31.161
Uh-uh, there are seven principles

86
00:03:31.161 --> 00:03:32.787
for thinking like Leonardo.

87
00:03:32.787 --> 00:03:33.806
<v Voiceover>If it's coming in a dream,</v>

88
00:03:33.806 --> 00:03:35.806
it's not as though you can dictate this anyway.

89
00:03:35.806 --> 00:03:39.508
<v ->It was my job to just record it.</v>

90
00:03:39.508 --> 00:03:40.185
<v Voiceover>Right. Right.</v>

91
00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:41.166
(laughter)

92
00:03:41.166 --> 00:03:44.001
Which is how a lot of these masters got their information.

93
00:03:44.001 --> 00:03:45.361
In dream time.

94
00:03:45.361 --> 00:03:46.741
In contemplative time.

95
00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:48.682
And looking at a rose.

96
00:03:48.682 --> 00:03:51.043
<v ->That's one of the secrets of thinking like Leonardo.</v>

97
00:03:51.043 --> 00:03:53.864
That's one of the things he recommends that we do.

98
00:03:53.864 --> 00:03:56.963
He actually gives these instructions in his notebooks.

99
00:03:56.963 --> 00:03:59.453
There's a lot of instruction to his students,

100
00:03:59.453 --> 00:04:03.428
and what I did was take those instructions and make them

101
00:04:03.428 --> 00:04:07.365
applicable to people in their everyday lives now, so...

102
00:04:07.365 --> 00:04:09.904
<v Voiceover>What's interesting is, as we're attending</v>

103
00:04:09.904 --> 00:04:14.124
this incredible conference, which is one of my favorites,

104
00:04:14.124 --> 00:04:17.647
that the whole notion of truth and beauty

105
00:04:17.647 --> 00:04:20.807
as fundamental elements of life,

106
00:04:20.807 --> 00:04:24.288
is truly coming back into understanding.

107
00:04:24.288 --> 00:04:28.566
Maybe you can comment on why and why now?

108
00:04:28.566 --> 00:04:30.726
And why this is so essential, because we seem

109
00:04:30.726 --> 00:04:33.545
to have given up so much of it for kind of crasser

110
00:04:33.545 --> 00:04:36.183
pursuits in the last several decades?

111
00:04:36.183 --> 00:04:37.003
(laughter)

112
00:04:37.003 --> 00:04:37.901
But maybe millennia.

113
00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:42.717
<v ->Well it's both time of the greatest crassness in history,</v>

114
00:04:42.717 --> 00:04:46.545
and greatest access to the treasures of every culture.

115
00:04:46.545 --> 00:04:47.986
So it's all there before us,

116
00:04:47.986 --> 00:04:51.046
which makes the power of choice

117
00:04:51.046 --> 00:04:54.526
that much more important for us to harness that power.

118
00:04:54.526 --> 00:04:56.424
To take advantage of it.

119
00:04:56.424 --> 00:04:59.326
So, if you don't make the choice,

120
00:04:59.326 --> 00:05:01.897
it is made for you,

121
00:05:01.897 --> 00:05:04.446
and the lowest common denominator

122
00:05:04.446 --> 00:05:07.386
of the mass marketplace drives you down

123
00:05:07.386 --> 00:05:10.161
to a very limited sense of awareness.

124
00:05:10.161 --> 00:05:10.822
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

125
00:05:10.822 --> 00:05:14.733
<v ->I mean the very first piece of art that we know of</v>

126
00:05:14.733 --> 00:05:16.493
from Leonardo da Vinci,

127
00:05:16.493 --> 00:05:19.902
is actually a painting by his teacher Verrocchio.

128
00:05:19.902 --> 00:05:23.182
Verrocchio, which means the true eye in Italian.

129
00:05:23.182 --> 00:05:24.162
Ver, truth.

130
00:05:24.162 --> 00:05:25.983
Occhio, eye.

131
00:05:25.983 --> 00:05:29.822
Verrocchio was doing a painting of the baptism of Christ,

132
00:05:29.822 --> 00:05:31.844
and he said to this promising young apprentice,

133
00:05:31.844 --> 00:05:35.182
"Leonardo, finish off the angel for me in the corner."

134
00:05:35.182 --> 00:05:36.742
So, Leonardo does this angel.

135
00:05:36.742 --> 00:05:38.502
Verrocchio comes back and sees it.

136
00:05:38.502 --> 00:05:41.853
And Vasari, the first art historian tells us,

137
00:05:41.853 --> 00:05:44.701
that Verrocchio would never touch colors again.

138
00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:46.862
He gave up painting 'cause he was so amazed

139
00:05:46.862 --> 00:05:49.081
by what Leonardo had created.

140
00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:50.743
Now, when you look at Leonardo's angel

141
00:05:50.743 --> 00:05:53.423
next to the angel painted by Verrocchio,

142
00:05:53.423 --> 00:05:54.943
you look at Verrocchio's angel,

143
00:05:54.943 --> 00:05:57.873
it looks like a bored choirboy.

144
00:05:57.873 --> 00:05:59.825
He's kind of OK, going through the motions.

145
00:05:59.825 --> 00:06:01.645
Yeah, baptism of Christ,

146
00:06:01.645 --> 00:06:03.445
OK, whatever, check.

147
00:06:03.445 --> 00:06:04.644
(laughter)

148
00:06:04.644 --> 00:06:07.944
Leonardo's angel has this reverent,

149
00:06:07.944 --> 00:06:12.777
phenomenal, transcendent look of,

150
00:06:12.777 --> 00:06:14.397
"This is a miracle."

151
00:06:16.037 --> 00:06:18.635
Now, when you go to the Uffizi Gallery,

152
00:06:18.635 --> 00:06:21.816
you see this, you'll see what Verrocchio saw.

153
00:06:21.816 --> 00:06:22.696
It's amazing.

154
00:06:22.696 --> 00:06:24.475
Not just in the context of the painting,

155
00:06:24.475 --> 00:06:27.290
but in the whole treasure house of the Uffizi.

156
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.749
But there's more to it 'cause Leonardo's showing us

157
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:32.070
these two ways of being in the world.

158
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.809
And Einstein said it, he said,

159
00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:35.411
"There are two ways to go through your life.

160
00:06:35.411 --> 00:06:37.509
"One is as though nothing is a miracle."

161
00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:38.637
That's Verrocchio's angel.

162
00:06:38.637 --> 00:06:39.176
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

163
00:06:39.176 --> 00:06:40.686
<v ->The other as though everything is a miracle.</v>

164
00:06:40.686 --> 00:06:42.006
That's Leonardo's angel.

165
00:06:42.006 --> 00:06:43.525
<v Voiceover>Which we prefer.</v>

166
00:06:43.525 --> 00:06:46.487
So, truth and beauty.

167
00:06:46.487 --> 00:06:49.248
How are the essence of truth and beauty,

168
00:06:49.248 --> 00:06:51.128
before we get into the actual application

169
00:06:51.128 --> 00:06:53.789
of what you're going to share with us,

170
00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:56.409
how are truth and beauty going to lead us back

171
00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:58.426
into a higher path?

172
00:06:58.426 --> 00:07:02.489
<v ->Well it's not so much truth and beauty</v>

173
00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:05.171
as something out there that's gonna come and lead you.

174
00:07:05.171 --> 00:07:06.211
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

175
00:07:06.211 --> 00:07:10.453
<v ->You need to do what you just did,</v>

176
00:07:10.453 --> 00:07:12.673
which is ask the question.

177
00:07:12.673 --> 00:07:15.115
And that's the first principle for thinking like Leonardo.

178
00:07:15.115 --> 00:07:17.355
Curiosita.

179
00:07:17.355 --> 00:07:19.516
If you start asking the question,

180
00:07:19.516 --> 00:07:23.496
"How do I connect with truth and beauty and goodness?

181
00:07:23.496 --> 00:07:25.598
"How do I bring more truth and beauty and goodness

182
00:07:25.598 --> 00:07:27.197
"into my life every day?

183
00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:31.239
"How do I cut through the tsunami of spam and see the world

184
00:07:31.239 --> 00:07:34.419
"through the eyes of Leonardo's angel?"

185
00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:36.983
You start to fill your consciousness with those kinds

186
00:07:36.983 --> 00:07:38.003
of questions.

187
00:07:38.003 --> 00:07:40.866
Well, that's what you will discover,

188
00:07:40.866 --> 00:07:44.426
versus if you're just thinking, you know,

189
00:07:44.426 --> 00:07:46.394
"Where's the golden arches?"

190
00:07:46.394 --> 00:07:46.902
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

191
00:07:46.902 --> 00:07:47.622
(laughter)

192
00:07:47.622 --> 00:07:48.475
Mold the golden arches.

193
00:07:48.475 --> 00:07:49.315
Yeah, right.

194
00:07:49.315 --> 00:07:50.854
OK, we know about that.

195
00:07:50.854 --> 00:07:52.274
There are even documentaries on that one

196
00:07:52.274 --> 00:07:53.394
out there now.

197
00:07:53.394 --> 00:07:56.514
So, number one, is curiosity.

198
00:07:56.514 --> 00:07:56.985
<v ->Yes.</v>

199
00:07:56.985 --> 00:07:58.004
<v Voiceover>Developing your curiosity.</v>

200
00:07:58.004 --> 00:07:59.585
Can you expand on that a little bit more?

201
00:07:59.585 --> 00:08:01.669
Because it seems as though as a species,

202
00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:04.892
we're going through life surviving,

203
00:08:04.892 --> 00:08:08.093
and that sense of curiosity is lost in many.

204
00:08:08.093 --> 00:08:09.431
<v ->Well, it's our birthright.</v>

205
00:08:09.431 --> 00:08:14.143
Every child is born with phenomenal genius-level curiosita.

206
00:08:15.073 --> 00:08:16.575
Freud wrote a book about Leonardo,

207
00:08:16.575 --> 00:08:19.416
and he said the great Leonardo continued to play as a child

208
00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:23.318
throughout his adult life, thus baffling his contemporaries.

209
00:08:23.318 --> 00:08:25.198
Leonardo asked these questions.

210
00:08:25.198 --> 00:08:27.862
In his notebook, he's musing on questions like,

211
00:08:27.862 --> 00:08:29.182
"What's the nature of light?

212
00:08:29.182 --> 00:08:30.503
"Why is the sky blue?"

213
00:08:30.503 --> 00:08:32.723
And then he goes about answering them.

214
00:08:32.723 --> 00:08:34.764
What he really wanted to know, though,

215
00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:36.917
the question underlying all of Leonardo's questions,

216
00:08:36.917 --> 00:08:39.137
is "What is the mind of God?

217
00:08:39.137 --> 00:08:42.234
"What is the true secret of the origin of life,

218
00:08:42.234 --> 00:08:44.842
"the meaning and the purpose of life?"

219
00:08:44.842 --> 00:08:48.940
How do we translate this practically into our own lives?

220
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.518
We do what Leonardo did.

221
00:08:50.518 --> 00:08:52.060
And keep a notebook.

222
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.499
The beauty of Leonardo's notebooks,

223
00:08:54.499 --> 00:08:56.198
for which he was criticized by the way by scholars

224
00:08:56.198 --> 00:08:56.939
for many years.

225
00:08:56.939 --> 00:08:58.245
They said, "He has no table of contents.

226
00:08:58.245 --> 00:08:59.226
"There's no index.

227
00:08:59.226 --> 00:09:02.663
"I mean on one page he treats of refraction of light,

228
00:09:02.663 --> 00:09:05.224
"the flow of water, and then he puts a shopping list

229
00:09:05.224 --> 00:09:07.004
"and some jokes on the same page."

230
00:09:07.004 --> 00:09:08.224
<v Voiceover>That was that other angel, right?</v>

231
00:09:08.224 --> 00:09:09.165
(laughter)

232
00:09:09.165 --> 00:09:11.325
<v ->No, the beauty of it is, yeah that's right.</v>

233
00:09:11.325 --> 00:09:12.923
The beauty of it is

234
00:09:12.923 --> 00:09:15.623
what you see in Leonardo's notebooks is a mind

235
00:09:15.623 --> 00:09:17.545
that's completely freed.

236
00:09:17.545 --> 00:09:20.467
And, now most people have to do writing for their job

237
00:09:20.467 --> 00:09:24.148
or for school, has to have a beginning, middle, and end.

238
00:09:24.148 --> 00:09:26.497
It gets evaluated by somebody else.

239
00:09:26.497 --> 00:09:27.059
You have a job.

240
00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:28.057
You go on a trip.

241
00:09:28.057 --> 00:09:29.377
You have to write an expense report.

242
00:09:29.377 --> 00:09:30.539
Your boss doesn't say to you,

243
00:09:30.539 --> 00:09:31.998
"Oh, let your mind go free.

244
00:09:31.998 --> 00:09:33.957
"Just come up with something out of the box."

245
00:09:33.957 --> 00:09:34.796
No, no, no.

246
00:09:34.796 --> 00:09:37.252
A lot of what we have to do in everyday life

247
00:09:37.252 --> 00:09:40.338
has to be in that box of linear thinking.

248
00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:42.833
Which is fine.

249
00:09:42.833 --> 00:09:44.989
Except that if that's the only thing you do,

250
00:09:44.989 --> 00:09:47.129
then you keep doing the same things over and over again,

251
00:09:47.129 --> 00:09:49.849
and you don't do new or creative things.

252
00:09:49.849 --> 00:09:51.292
So to get out of that box,

253
00:09:51.292 --> 00:09:55.609
we need to let the mind flow freely as we see Leonardo doing

254
00:09:55.609 --> 00:09:57.709
in his notebooks, as he guides us to do.

255
00:09:57.709 --> 00:10:00.718
And we can do the same thing by,

256
00:10:01.608 --> 00:10:04.706
well considering where you are when you get your best ideas.

257
00:10:04.706 --> 00:10:06.933
I've asked this question for the last 28 years.

258
00:10:06.933 --> 00:10:11.033
People all over the world, number one answer,

259
00:10:11.033 --> 00:10:13.373
driving in my car.

260
00:10:13.373 --> 00:10:14.842
Number two, in the shower, the bath.

261
00:10:14.842 --> 00:10:15.642
<v Voiceover>That's right.</v>

262
00:10:15.642 --> 00:10:17.222
<v ->Number three, resting in bed.</v>

263
00:10:17.222 --> 00:10:19.542
Almost no one ever says, "At work."

264
00:10:19.542 --> 00:10:20.940
(laughter)

265
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:21.882
<v Voiceover>True.</v>

266
00:10:21.882 --> 00:10:22.541
<v ->But why?</v>

267
00:10:22.541 --> 00:10:24.913
Because at work you're in the box, linear thinking.

268
00:10:24.913 --> 00:10:26.414
You're afraid of getting the wrong answer,

269
00:10:26.414 --> 00:10:29.399
of saying something that might get you judged or laughed at.

270
00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:30.926
At four o'clock in the morning when you wake up,

271
00:10:30.926 --> 00:10:32.566
your mind is free.

272
00:10:32.566 --> 00:10:35.127
And it's playing just like Leonardo demonstrates

273
00:10:35.127 --> 00:10:37.667
the mind to play in his notebooks.

274
00:10:37.667 --> 00:10:40.241
So we learn to continue that process and keep it

275
00:10:40.241 --> 00:10:42.090
in your Da Vinci journal.

276
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.069
So, Leonardo's probably the most curious person

277
00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:48.267
who ever lived, so curious he would not take

278
00:10:48.267 --> 00:10:49.827
yes for an answer.

279
00:10:49.827 --> 00:10:50.518
(laughter)

280
00:10:50.518 --> 00:10:53.738
And we all want to return to that birthright of genius,

281
00:10:53.738 --> 00:10:57.442
and it begins with, "How do I do it?"

282
00:10:57.442 --> 00:10:58.300
Curiosita.

283
00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.140
<v Voiceover>Asking the questions.</v>

284
00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.302
<v ->Asking the questions.</v>

285
00:11:00.302 --> 00:11:02.263
<v Voiceover>Number two.</v>

286
00:11:02.263 --> 00:11:04.280
Dimostrazione.

287
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.561
<v ->Hey, molto bene.</v>

288
00:11:05.561 --> 00:11:06.682
Molto bene.

289
00:11:06.682 --> 00:11:07.621
<v Voiceover>Please tell us.</v>

290
00:11:07.621 --> 00:11:09.166
<v ->Dimostrazione.</v>

291
00:11:09.166 --> 00:11:11.847
It's a word Leonardo uses over and over again

292
00:11:11.847 --> 00:11:12.967
in his notebook.

293
00:11:12.967 --> 00:11:14.648
He says, "Demonstrate things for yourself.

294
00:11:14.648 --> 00:11:16.207
"Think for yourself.

295
00:11:16.207 --> 00:11:18.588
"Be an independent thinker."

296
00:11:18.588 --> 00:11:21.207
He came along after a thousand years in the Middle Ages

297
00:11:21.207 --> 00:11:24.027
when no one questioned anything,

298
00:11:24.027 --> 00:11:26.506
and he questioned everything.

299
00:11:26.506 --> 00:11:28.547
Now, the challenge to independent thinking back then

300
00:11:28.547 --> 00:11:31.108
was lack of information.

301
00:11:31.108 --> 00:11:32.708
You couldn't get a book.

302
00:11:32.708 --> 00:11:33.908
And if you could, it was in Latin,

303
00:11:33.908 --> 00:11:35.368
which you wouldn't have learned unless you were

304
00:11:35.368 --> 00:11:37.888
a noble or a cleric.

305
00:11:37.888 --> 00:11:40.069
Now the challenge to independent thinking,

306
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:41.667
too much information.

307
00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:42.527
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

308
00:11:42.527 --> 00:11:46.988
<v ->How you cut through it and get to that which will lead you</v>

309
00:11:46.988 --> 00:11:49.585
to truth and beauty and goodness.

310
00:11:49.585 --> 00:11:52.667
You have to cultivate the ability to be what Leonardo

311
00:11:52.667 --> 00:11:56.546
called an inventore, an original thinker.

312
00:11:56.546 --> 00:11:57.925
Now he had a method.

313
00:11:57.925 --> 00:12:01.905
He called it ostinata rigore, obstinate rigor.

314
00:12:01.905 --> 00:12:03.865
And the method was to look at everything from at least

315
00:12:03.865 --> 00:12:05.344
three perspectives.

316
00:12:05.344 --> 00:12:07.365
So when you look at his drawings of a flower,

317
00:12:07.365 --> 00:12:10.295
for example, he looks at the flower from three angles.

318
00:12:10.295 --> 00:12:10.965
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

319
00:12:10.965 --> 00:12:12.690
<v ->His sketch of a face, three angles.</v>

320
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.028
When he wanted to learn about anatomy,

321
00:12:14.028 --> 00:12:16.668
he didn't just read the texts of the time,

322
00:12:16.668 --> 00:12:18.809
he dissected more than 30 bodies,

323
00:12:18.809 --> 00:12:20.144
and he was the first ever to do it

324
00:12:20.144 --> 00:12:22.045
from at least three angles.

325
00:12:22.045 --> 00:12:22.546
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

326
00:12:22.546 --> 00:12:24.106
<v ->He says if you want to evaluate your idea,</v>

327
00:12:24.106 --> 00:12:26.926
you must step back and look at it from a distance.

328
00:12:26.926 --> 00:12:29.026
Then, sleep on it.

329
00:12:29.026 --> 00:12:31.867
Come back the next day, ask someone you respect

330
00:12:31.867 --> 00:12:32.826
to critique it.

331
00:12:32.826 --> 00:12:33.986
Listen with an open mind.

332
00:12:33.986 --> 00:12:36.288
Only then can you say that you've thought about it.

333
00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:37.747
<v Voiceover>That is so true.</v>

334
00:12:37.747 --> 00:12:41.817
To be open to that, to be open to the scrutiny of others,

335
00:12:41.817 --> 00:12:43.436
by way of putting yourself out there,

336
00:12:43.436 --> 00:12:45.816
but the sleeping on it, I find is a huge one.

337
00:12:45.816 --> 00:12:47.338
<v ->And he tells you to do it in his notebooks.</v>

338
00:12:47.338 --> 00:12:48.436
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

339
00:12:48.436 --> 00:12:49.736
Mhmm. Very good.

340
00:12:49.736 --> 00:12:51.257
So, that's number two.

341
00:12:51.257 --> 00:12:52.157
Number three.

342
00:12:52.157 --> 00:12:53.497
<v ->Sensazione.</v>

343
00:12:53.497 --> 00:12:54.337
<v Voiceover>Sensazione.</v>

344
00:12:54.337 --> 00:12:55.077
<v ->Sensazione.</v>

345
00:12:55.077 --> 00:12:56.369
<v Voiceover>We can all guess what that might be.</v>

346
00:12:56.369 --> 00:12:57.090
The senses.

347
00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:57.790
<v ->Sharpen all the senses.</v>

348
00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:58.429
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

349
00:12:58.429 --> 00:12:59.269
<v ->Sharpen all the senses.</v>

350
00:12:59.269 --> 00:13:01.002
Leonardo said the five senses

351
00:13:01.002 --> 00:13:03.742
are the "ministers of the soul."

352
00:13:03.742 --> 00:13:06.083
He trained his own sensory awareness like an Olympic

353
00:13:06.083 --> 00:13:09.022
athlete trains their body for competition.

354
00:13:09.022 --> 00:13:11.381
But 500 years ago in Tuscany,

355
00:13:11.381 --> 00:13:14.202
Leonardo wrote that the average person looks without seeing,

356
00:13:14.202 --> 00:13:17.756
hears without listening, touches without feeling,

357
00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:20.516
breathes in without awareness of aroma or fragrance,

358
00:13:20.516 --> 00:13:23.937
eats without tasting, and talks without thinking.

359
00:13:23.937 --> 00:13:24.857
<v Voiceover>Still true.</v>

360
00:13:24.857 --> 00:13:26.199
(laughter)

361
00:13:26.199 --> 00:13:28.249
<v ->That was in Tuscany 500 years ago.</v>

362
00:13:28.249 --> 00:13:29.058
<v Voiceover>That's a shame.</v>

363
00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:30.958
To take a pass on that, yeah.

364
00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.300
<v ->So it relates to what we discussed earlier</v>

365
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.999
that you must cultivate a conscious discipline

366
00:13:37.999 --> 00:13:39.619
for sharpening your senses otherwise they will be--

367
00:13:39.619 --> 00:13:40.790
<v Voiceover>But doesn't that have to require you</v>

368
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.477
being in the present to do that, and aren't we usually

369
00:13:42.477 --> 00:13:44.259
living in the past or the future?

370
00:13:44.259 --> 00:13:45.664
Thinking, thinking one way or the other,

371
00:13:45.664 --> 00:13:47.005
one direction or the other?

372
00:13:47.005 --> 00:13:49.230
<v ->Well this is the beauty of la dolce vita,</v>

373
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.710
the sweet, soulful life.

374
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:53.031
It's about savoring every moment through the aliveness

375
00:13:53.031 --> 00:13:54.892
of your senses.

376
00:13:54.892 --> 00:13:56.012
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

377
00:13:56.012 --> 00:13:58.501
<v ->My friends in Italy have a much better perspective</v>

378
00:13:58.501 --> 00:14:01.180
on history than my friends in the states.

379
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.017
They're the Romans.

380
00:14:03.017 --> 00:14:05.499
My friends in the states though, tend to be,

381
00:14:05.499 --> 00:14:08.418
very strongly oriented towards creating a better future.

382
00:14:09.358 --> 00:14:11.227
Which means they almost never have time for lunch.

383
00:14:11.227 --> 00:14:11.901
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

384
00:14:11.901 --> 00:14:15.603
<v ->But my friends in Italy, when the pasta comes out,</v>

385
00:14:15.603 --> 00:14:18.189
little fresh tomatoes, some basil,

386
00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:19.609
a little bit of pecorino cheese--

387
00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:20.469
<v Voiceover>Oh, yeah.</v>

388
00:14:20.469 --> 00:14:22.425
<v ->Beautiful glass of wine.</v>

389
00:14:22.425 --> 00:14:25.506
Ah, the aroma, it helps when there's a field of lavender

390
00:14:25.506 --> 00:14:28.146
with some white butterflies dancing in it, and--

391
00:14:28.146 --> 00:14:29.502
<v Voiceover>It helps when you're given permission.</v>

392
00:14:29.502 --> 00:14:31.819
I love those Italian and French lunches.

393
00:14:31.819 --> 00:14:33.020
<v ->Right, well this is the thing.</v>

394
00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:33.576
<v Voiceover>Permission.</v>

395
00:14:33.576 --> 00:14:34.355
<v ->You mentioned the French too,</v>

396
00:14:34.355 --> 00:14:35.751
'cause the French have Joie de vivre.

397
00:14:35.751 --> 00:14:36.416
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

398
00:14:36.416 --> 00:14:38.293
<v ->The Italians have la dolce vida.</v>

399
00:14:38.293 --> 00:14:38.993
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

400
00:14:38.993 --> 00:14:40.214
<v ->What do we have in the states?</v>

401
00:14:40.214 --> 00:14:40.654
<v Voiceover>Nothing.</v>

402
00:14:40.654 --> 00:14:41.532
<v ->Happy hour.</v>

403
00:14:41.532 --> 00:14:42.552
(laughing)

404
00:14:42.552 --> 00:14:43.632
<v Voiceover>Well that's at the end of the day.</v>

405
00:14:43.632 --> 00:14:44.589
<v ->We need help.</v>

406
00:14:44.589 --> 00:14:45.829
We need help big time.

407
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:47.169
But, here's the deal.

408
00:14:47.169 --> 00:14:51.250
What I'm trying to guide people through my work,

409
00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:54.643
is to this notion I call a modern, contemporary

410
00:14:54.643 --> 00:14:56.583
renaissance man or woman.

411
00:14:56.583 --> 00:14:59.283
And that contemporary renaissance man or woman

412
00:14:59.283 --> 00:15:02.221
has an appreciation of history,

413
00:15:02.221 --> 00:15:04.821
and the history of all cultures.

414
00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:07.921
Is committed to creating a more brilliant, beautiful,

415
00:15:07.921 --> 00:15:12.603
inclusive future, but understands that

416
00:15:12.603 --> 00:15:15.121
the secret of that is savoring

417
00:15:15.121 --> 00:15:19.500
with full presence every moment now.

418
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.560
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

419
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.439
<v ->So, the good news is that this is far more joyful</v>

420
00:15:24.439 --> 00:15:25.980
way to be.

421
00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.500
And there's so much richness and beauty and magnificence

422
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.340
all around us, all the time.

423
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.614
But, we all need all the help we can get to remember that

424
00:15:35.614 --> 00:15:37.342
in the midst of all the onslaught of--

425
00:15:37.342 --> 00:15:38.633
<v Voiceover>Well and not only that,</v>

426
00:15:38.633 --> 00:15:43.062
our ethic in the Western world often doesn't allow us,

427
00:15:44.032 --> 00:15:46.014
it's almost as though we have to seek out side permission

428
00:15:46.014 --> 00:15:48.943
to be granted enough time to stop and even taste our food.

429
00:15:48.943 --> 00:15:49.934
<v ->Well that's why I'm here.</v>

430
00:15:49.934 --> 00:15:51.395
To give, I give that permission.

431
00:15:51.395 --> 00:15:52.377
<v Voiceover>You give permission?</v>

432
00:15:52.377 --> 00:15:53.576
<v ->This is the Queen Mother wave.</v>

433
00:15:53.576 --> 00:15:54.690
This is the Pope wave.

434
00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:57.457
The Pope does the mudra of Cathare when he gives you

435
00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:58.067
the blessing.

436
00:15:58.067 --> 00:15:59.218
<v Voiceover>So you are giving us your blessings.</v>

437
00:15:59.218 --> 00:16:00.899
<v ->Here you go, thank you very much.</v>

438
00:16:00.899 --> 00:16:02.499
Please savor the moment.

439
00:16:02.499 --> 00:16:04.020
You're officially blessed to do so.

440
00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.119
(laughter)

441
00:16:05.119 --> 00:16:06.598
<v Voiceover>And you're absolutely right.</v>

442
00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:08.279
That is our right to do that.

443
00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:09.438
That's what we were born to do.

444
00:16:09.438 --> 00:16:10.178
<v ->It's our birthright.</v>

445
00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:11.719
<v Voiceover>And we forget that that is our birthright</v>

446
00:16:11.719 --> 00:16:14.238
in the pursuit of something in the future.

447
00:16:14.238 --> 00:16:15.238
So true.

448
00:16:15.238 --> 00:16:16.338
Number four.

449
00:16:16.338 --> 00:16:19.031
This one, I don't know how you pronounce the word,

450
00:16:19.031 --> 00:16:21.630
but it's the willingness to embrace the unknown.

451
00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:22.990
How do you say this in Italian?

452
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.132
<v ->Beautiful job of manifesting the principle by embracing</v>

453
00:16:26.132 --> 00:16:28.331
the ambiguity of not knowing how to pronounce it.

454
00:16:28.331 --> 00:16:29.612
<v Voiceover>Well, there you go.</v>

455
00:16:29.612 --> 00:16:30.551
(laughter)

456
00:16:30.551 --> 00:16:31.854
<v ->It is Sfumato.</v>

457
00:16:31.854 --> 00:16:33.133
<v Voiceover>Sfumato.</v>
<v ->Sfumato.</v>

458
00:16:33.133 --> 00:16:35.009
Sfumato, like fumes.

459
00:16:35.009 --> 00:16:36.789
Like going up in smoke.

460
00:16:36.789 --> 00:16:40.067
It's a term that art critics coined to refer to the hazy,

461
00:16:40.067 --> 00:16:43.169
mysterious quality in Leonardo's paintings.

462
00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:46.624
A quality he achieved through the gossamer-thin application

463
00:16:46.624 --> 00:16:49.045
of hundreds of layers of paint,

464
00:16:49.045 --> 00:16:51.142
so the light seems to suffuse magically

465
00:16:51.142 --> 00:16:52.620
from behind the canvass.

466
00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:53.282
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

467
00:16:53.282 --> 00:16:55.319
<v ->And what it represents is maybe the most distinguishing</v>

468
00:16:55.319 --> 00:16:57.679
characteristic of highly creative people,

469
00:16:57.679 --> 00:16:59.380
which is their ability to embrace the unknown.

470
00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:00.520
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

471
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.002
<v ->I mean if you have curiosita, and you're asking these</v>

472
00:17:03.002 --> 00:17:05.440
big questions, dimostrazione,

473
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.459
you're testing things out for yourself.

474
00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:10.201
Sensazione, you're sharpening all your senses.

475
00:17:10.201 --> 00:17:13.541
The results gonna be far more uncertainty.

476
00:17:13.541 --> 00:17:14.220
<v Voiceover>True.</v>

477
00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.681
<v ->So, a hallmark of genius is confusion endurance.</v>

478
00:17:17.681 --> 00:17:21.401
But we tend to want premature certainty

479
00:17:21.401 --> 00:17:23.342
for reasons of security.

480
00:17:23.342 --> 00:17:25.254
It's really an emotional quality.

481
00:17:25.254 --> 00:17:29.501
So cultivating the ability to smile like the Mona Lisa

482
00:17:29.501 --> 00:17:33.540
in the face of the unknown, this is the essence of Sfumato.

483
00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.801
<v Voiceover>So embrace the unknown.</v>

484
00:17:36.801 --> 00:17:37.980
<v ->Embrace uncertainty.</v>

485
00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.101
<v Voiceover>Embrace uncertainty,</v>

486
00:17:39.101 --> 00:17:42.081
which is something Western culture is not comfortable with.

487
00:17:42.081 --> 00:17:44.543
<v ->Well, we're having to learn it,</v>

488
00:17:44.543 --> 00:17:45.953
because things are changing so fast--

489
00:17:45.953 --> 00:17:46.792
<v Voiceover>Oh boy, are they.</v>

490
00:17:46.792 --> 00:17:47.611
(laughter)

491
00:17:47.611 --> 00:17:50.523
<v ->That I mean this, my clients, you know I do</v>

492
00:17:50.523 --> 00:17:53.484
a lot of coaching with businesses and consulting for them,

493
00:17:53.484 --> 00:17:56.043
and I've been doing it for about 28 years,

494
00:17:56.043 --> 00:18:00.195
and I have people

495
00:18:00.195 --> 00:18:02.615
who call me and then they call me back and they say,

496
00:18:02.615 --> 00:18:03.997
"Now we really need this."

497
00:18:03.997 --> 00:18:06.136
They say, "Oh, but now we really, really need it,"

498
00:18:06.136 --> 00:18:08.337
because it's getting that much more intense.

499
00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:10.415
<v Voiceover>So how do you coach a corporation</v>

500
00:18:10.415 --> 00:18:14.677
to be willing to live with the unknown and uncertainty,

501
00:18:14.677 --> 00:18:17.316
which is an antithetical to their purpose

502
00:18:17.316 --> 00:18:20.635
of having absolutes for your shareholders, et cetera?

503
00:18:20.635 --> 00:18:21.565
How do you do this?

504
00:18:21.565 --> 00:18:22.247
How do they do this?

505
00:18:22.247 --> 00:18:23.568
<v ->Helping them understand the rhythm</v>

506
00:18:23.568 --> 00:18:26.748
and the balance between those states

507
00:18:26.748 --> 00:18:30.688
of relative knowing and embracing the unknown

508
00:18:30.688 --> 00:18:33.688
that's necessary to allow the intuitive--

509
00:18:33.688 --> 00:18:34.870
<v Voiceover>To breathe.</v>

510
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.970
<v ->To breathe, to integrate with the analytical.</v>

511
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:41.109
So, a lot of them have a mental asthma,

512
00:18:41.109 --> 00:18:43.108
and they're just in the analytical,

513
00:18:43.108 --> 00:18:44.749
which leads us into the next principle,

514
00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:47.629
which is Arte, Scienze.

515
00:18:47.629 --> 00:18:51.829
Balance art and science, logic and imagination,

516
00:18:51.829 --> 00:18:53.949
analysis and intuition.

517
00:18:53.949 --> 00:18:56.208
So work intensively as hard as you can.

518
00:18:56.208 --> 00:18:57.268
Try to figure it out.

519
00:18:57.268 --> 00:18:58.669
Try to solve your problem.

520
00:18:58.669 --> 00:19:00.188
Get all the data.

521
00:19:00.188 --> 00:19:02.029
Look at it every way you can.

522
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:03.088
Brainstorm it.

523
00:19:03.088 --> 00:19:04.208
Discuss it.

524
00:19:04.208 --> 00:19:05.812
Test it.

525
00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:07.250
Then let it go.

526
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:10.610
Leonardo said, "You must take a little relaxation.

527
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:11.931
"Come back to it the next day,

528
00:19:11.931 --> 00:19:12.762
"and look at it afresh."

529
00:19:12.762 --> 00:19:13.771
<v Voiceover>Mhmm, sleep on it.</v>

530
00:19:13.771 --> 00:19:15.520
<v ->I literally get my clients to apply this</v>

531
00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.101
in the way they run their meetings.

532
00:19:17.101 --> 00:19:19.108
They integrate breaks, and I have 'em listen to Mozart

533
00:19:19.108 --> 00:19:22.030
music, and practice juggling in the midst of very serious

534
00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.629
strategic planning sessions.

535
00:19:23.629 --> 00:19:25.169
<v Voiceover>Do you ever watch this dynamic?</v>

536
00:19:25.169 --> 00:19:26.027
<v ->Oh yeah.</v>

537
00:19:26.027 --> 00:19:27.748
<v Voiceover>Are you in on the entire process so you see</v>

538
00:19:27.748 --> 00:19:30.669
the dynamic where people might even go into,

539
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:32.867
"Don't know what the boss is going to think about this

540
00:19:32.867 --> 00:19:35.129
"if I really open up that side of the brain

541
00:19:35.129 --> 00:19:36.298
"and let it fly."

542
00:19:36.298 --> 00:19:38.228
How do they integrate in these kinds of brainstorming--

543
00:19:38.228 --> 00:19:39.710
<v ->Well see the good news at least talk about that,</v>

544
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:42.211
their boss, the proverbial oppressive boss--

545
00:19:42.211 --> 00:19:42.910
<v Voiceover>He's there.</v>

546
00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.111
<v ->I work with those bosses.</v>

547
00:19:44.111 --> 00:19:46.532
And I work with their bosses who they think are oppressive.

548
00:19:46.532 --> 00:19:47.092
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

549
00:19:47.092 --> 00:19:48.171
<v ->But the good news is that really,</v>

550
00:19:48.171 --> 00:19:51.212
I have a biased sample 'cause in my career,

551
00:19:51.212 --> 00:19:54.613
I've only tended to really be hired by visionary,

552
00:19:54.613 --> 00:19:57.792
creative, humanistic bosses, who are seeking more

553
00:19:57.792 --> 00:20:00.211
truth, beauty, and goodness as well as profit

554
00:20:00.211 --> 00:20:01.732
in the workplace.

555
00:20:01.732 --> 00:20:03.732
I don't get hired by the scorch the earth,

556
00:20:03.732 --> 00:20:06.313
destroy the environment, exploit the worker types.

557
00:20:06.313 --> 00:20:06.832
(laughter)

558
00:20:06.832 --> 00:20:07.891
<v Voiceover>We won't name names,</v>

559
00:20:07.891 --> 00:20:09.711
but maybe you can name the names

560
00:20:09.711 --> 00:20:11.710
of some of the corporations who really, really

561
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.491
are seeking truth, goodness, beauty, et cetera.

562
00:20:14.491 --> 00:20:16.360
Can you care to share who some of those might be

563
00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.100
so we can support them--

564
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.099
<v ->Well I can tell yah.</v>

565
00:20:18.099 --> 00:20:20.055
Sure, well, I mean you may be surprised

566
00:20:20.055 --> 00:20:21.581
at some of the names because--

567
00:20:21.581 --> 00:20:23.400
<v Voiceover>That's OK, I love being surprised.</v>

568
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.155
<v ->But I just came from speaking at Merck's Global Leadership</v>

569
00:20:26.155 --> 00:20:27.295
Conference.

570
00:20:28.244 --> 00:20:32.852
I did a webcast for all of their folks all over the planet.

571
00:20:33.452 --> 00:20:36.866
And they could not have been more receptive.

572
00:20:36.866 --> 00:20:38.572
<v Voiceover>Interesting because they're beleaguered.</v>

573
00:20:38.572 --> 00:20:40.672
<v ->Right, they're beleaguered but you know,</v>

574
00:20:40.672 --> 00:20:43.991
they're also a company of very fine people.

575
00:20:43.991 --> 00:20:45.350
Brilliant people.

576
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.073
And with everything they've been through

577
00:20:48.073 --> 00:20:49.772
and all the pressures of the marketplace,

578
00:20:49.772 --> 00:20:51.971
there is a core commitment of value

579
00:20:51.971 --> 00:20:53.069
in that organization,

580
00:20:53.069 --> 00:20:55.090
I've worked with them since 1988,

581
00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.668
about actually helping patients.

582
00:20:57.668 --> 00:20:58.649
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

583
00:20:58.649 --> 00:20:59.290
<v ->You know.</v>

584
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:00.684
I think that's all lost in the media

585
00:21:00.684 --> 00:21:02.285
and you would never know that from what you read,

586
00:21:02.285 --> 00:21:07.005
but that's there, and that's part of what informs

587
00:21:07.005 --> 00:21:11.070
the core of what gave birth to their organization.

588
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:15.445
And it's being aligned with that fundamental core

589
00:21:15.445 --> 00:21:18.507
of goodness, that is part of the key

590
00:21:18.507 --> 00:21:20.446
to navigate through a lot of the challenges

591
00:21:20.446 --> 00:21:21.765
that they've been facing.

592
00:21:21.765 --> 00:21:24.082
But when I share that with people,

593
00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:26.070
you see the light come back on.

594
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:27.490
Yeah, that's why I came to work here.

595
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.970
That's why I took this job.

596
00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:31.610
That's, you know, and I've people there

597
00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:34.991
for 15-20 years and longer.

598
00:21:34.991 --> 00:21:38.892
I'm gonna give a talk to all the new hires

599
00:21:38.892 --> 00:21:40.806
for Microsoft this year.

600
00:21:40.806 --> 00:21:42.045
Now 'cause they want to imprint them

601
00:21:42.045 --> 00:21:43.707
right from the beginning with thinking like history's

602
00:21:43.707 --> 00:21:46.484
greatest genius, and you know, Bill Gates

603
00:21:46.484 --> 00:21:51.107
paid $30.8 million for 18 pages

604
00:21:51.107 --> 00:21:54.132
of Leonardo's notebooks in 1994.

605
00:21:54.132 --> 00:21:54.910
<v Voiceover>Mmm.</v>

606
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:56.191
<v ->Most people only have to pay 16 bucks</v>

607
00:21:56.191 --> 00:21:57.169
to get a copy of my book.

608
00:21:57.169 --> 00:21:57.968
<v Voiceover>$16.</v>

609
00:21:57.968 --> 00:21:59.527
(laughter)

610
00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:00.288
<v ->You're makin' money.</v>

611
00:22:00.288 --> 00:22:02.368
<v Voiceover>Let's see, which one is the better value?</v>

612
00:22:02.368 --> 00:22:03.604
<v ->Right, hello.</v>

613
00:22:03.604 --> 00:22:06.014
(laughter)

614
00:22:06.014 --> 00:22:06.784
<v Voiceover>Interesting.</v>

615
00:22:06.784 --> 00:22:08.012
<v ->But why'd Gates pay so much?</v>

616
00:22:08.012 --> 00:22:08.561
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

617
00:22:08.561 --> 00:22:10.628
<v ->Because he wants to associate his legacy</v>

618
00:22:10.628 --> 00:22:12.329
with bringing the world into the information age

619
00:22:12.329 --> 00:22:13.587
from the industrial age,

620
00:22:13.587 --> 00:22:17.008
just like Leonardo brought the world into the Renaissance

621
00:22:17.008 --> 00:22:18.270
from the Middle Ages.

622
00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:19.269
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

623
00:22:19.269 --> 00:22:20.208
Interesting.

624
00:22:20.208 --> 00:22:22.425
And a couple others you'd like to share?

625
00:22:22.425 --> 00:22:24.166
Merck, Microsoft.

626
00:22:24.166 --> 00:22:25.086
<v ->Let's see.</v>

627
00:22:25.086 --> 00:22:27.905
Well, I worked for many years with the head of the DuPont

628
00:22:27.905 --> 00:22:29.004
Pension Fund.

629
00:22:29.004 --> 00:22:29.965
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

630
00:22:29.965 --> 00:22:31.924
<v ->He just retired a year or two ago,</v>

631
00:22:31.924 --> 00:22:34.524
but another visionary leader.

632
00:22:34.524 --> 00:22:36.003
Super, super person.

633
00:22:36.003 --> 00:22:39.464
Protected, grew the assets for all those folks

634
00:22:39.464 --> 00:22:43.545
who toiled for years in bringing us Teflon.

635
00:22:43.545 --> 00:22:44.661
<v Voiceover>Right, OK. Right.</v>

636
00:22:44.661 --> 00:22:46.201
(laughter)

637
00:22:47.306 --> 00:22:48.907
Just curious.
<v ->Gosh, you got this--</v>

638
00:22:48.907 --> 00:22:51.744
<v Voiceover>So basically, it's really.</v>

639
00:22:51.744 --> 00:22:54.245
There's nothing you could predict with certainty.

640
00:22:54.245 --> 00:22:57.206
It's not just gonna be the granola companies.

641
00:22:57.206 --> 00:22:57.764
<v ->Oh no.</v>

642
00:22:57.764 --> 00:22:58.543
<v Voiceover>It's the big companies.</v>

643
00:22:58.543 --> 00:22:59.684
<v ->Plus, the thing you have to understand,</v>

644
00:22:59.684 --> 00:23:01.484
is all the granola companies--

645
00:23:01.484 --> 00:23:03.095
<v Voiceover>Which I love by the way, totally behind--</v>

646
00:23:03.095 --> 00:23:04.014
<v ->Which we all love, yes.</v>

647
00:23:04.014 --> 00:23:05.709
But they're bought out frequently by--

648
00:23:05.709 --> 00:23:06.308
<v Voiceover>That's true.</v>

649
00:23:06.308 --> 00:23:07.308
<v ->You know companies that,</v>

650
00:23:07.308 --> 00:23:08.469
the people who are buying the granola

651
00:23:08.469 --> 00:23:10.509
don't realize that they parent company

652
00:23:10.509 --> 00:23:12.850
is the biggest donor to the political party

653
00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.950
that they're not supporting themselves.

654
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:16.029
<v Voiceover>It's a very interesting--</v>

655
00:23:16.029 --> 00:23:17.852
<v ->So it's not as simple as it seems so don't,</v>

656
00:23:17.852 --> 00:23:20.841
it's not about the granola out there.

657
00:23:20.841 --> 00:23:22.531
<v Voiceover>That's very true and that's a good point</v>

658
00:23:22.531 --> 00:23:23.212
to make.

659
00:23:23.212 --> 00:23:27.277
You never know where the consciousness actually exists,

660
00:23:27.277 --> 00:23:30.076
unless you know the person who's responsible face to face.

661
00:23:30.076 --> 00:23:31.373
That's what I've found--

662
00:23:31.373 --> 00:23:33.265
<v ->And what they're manifesting, that's just right.</v>

663
00:23:33.265 --> 00:23:33.936
<v Voiceover>That is very true.</v>

664
00:23:33.936 --> 00:23:34.434
<v ->Yes.</v>

665
00:23:34.434 --> 00:23:36.086
<v Voiceover>OK, we go on from there to the cultivation.</v>

666
00:23:36.086 --> 00:23:38.014
Number six, the cultivation of grace.

667
00:23:38.014 --> 00:23:39.415
<v ->Yes, ah.</v>

668
00:23:39.415 --> 00:23:41.275
Corporalita.

669
00:23:41.275 --> 00:23:44.695
Corporalita, balance the body and mind.

670
00:23:44.695 --> 00:23:47.786
Leonardo, in addition to being a artistic and scientific

671
00:23:47.786 --> 00:23:52.267
genius, was also renowned for his physical poise and grace,

672
00:23:52.267 --> 00:23:56.386
for his strength, for his beauty,

673
00:23:56.386 --> 00:24:00.287
for the phenomenal power of his presence.

674
00:24:00.287 --> 00:24:02.505
People used to literally turn out to watch him

675
00:24:02.505 --> 00:24:05.767
walk down the street 'cause he cut such a graceful,

676
00:24:05.767 --> 00:24:07.067
powerful figure.

677
00:24:07.067 --> 00:24:10.136
And he gives advice about health and wellness

678
00:24:10.136 --> 00:24:13.247
that's as relevant today as it was 500 years ago

679
00:24:13.247 --> 00:24:14.706
because it's timeless.

680
00:24:14.706 --> 00:24:17.327
He says, "Learn to preserve your own health."

681
00:24:17.327 --> 00:24:19.066
Well isn't that the essence of holistic health?

682
00:24:19.066 --> 00:24:19.766
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

683
00:24:19.766 --> 00:24:21.225
<v ->He says, "Keep your mind cheerful</v>

684
00:24:21.225 --> 00:24:22.926
"and avoid grievous moods."

685
00:24:22.926 --> 00:24:24.367
Well isn't that the modern discipline

686
00:24:24.367 --> 00:24:26.226
of Psychoneuroimmunology that tells us

687
00:24:26.226 --> 00:24:28.187
that our attitude affects our immune system

688
00:24:28.187 --> 00:24:29.227
from moment to moment?

689
00:24:29.227 --> 00:24:30.047
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

690
00:24:30.047 --> 00:24:32.005
<v ->He says, "Eat a healthy, wholesome diet</v>

691
00:24:32.005 --> 00:24:33.769
"of the freshest foods you can find."

692
00:24:33.769 --> 00:24:35.809
But most importantly, "Enjoy it."

693
00:24:35.809 --> 00:24:39.469
Savor each meal in a beautiful environment.

694
00:24:39.469 --> 00:24:41.709
Have a little red wine with dinner and get moderate

695
00:24:41.709 --> 00:24:42.448
exercise.

696
00:24:42.448 --> 00:24:43.317
What else do you need to know?

697
00:24:43.317 --> 00:24:44.798
<v Voiceover>The moderate exercise part.</v>

698
00:24:44.798 --> 00:24:47.858
I think that that is something we seem to again

699
00:24:47.858 --> 00:24:51.237
often go into extremes in modern culture.

700
00:24:51.237 --> 00:24:52.779
We're either, we're couch potatoes

701
00:24:52.779 --> 00:24:55.738
or we're really grinding the muscles at the gym.

702
00:24:55.738 --> 00:24:58.019
When that whole notion of the middle path

703
00:24:58.019 --> 00:25:01.459
and grace seems to me so obvious.

704
00:25:01.459 --> 00:25:03.420
<v ->Well those extremes are just characteristic</v>

705
00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.620
of life right now.

706
00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:06.279
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

707
00:25:06.279 --> 00:25:08.099
<v ->I mean you either have total couch potato,</v>

708
00:25:08.099 --> 00:25:09.358
denial of the body.

709
00:25:09.358 --> 00:25:10.157
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

710
00:25:10.157 --> 00:25:13.577
<v ->Or, like get rock hard abs and be a maniac,</v>

711
00:25:13.577 --> 00:25:15.117
who lives only in the gym.

712
00:25:15.117 --> 00:25:15.798
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

713
00:25:15.798 --> 00:25:17.066
<v ->And it's just, what's wrong with this picture?</v>

714
00:25:17.066 --> 00:25:19.219
<v Voiceover>But what about just walking as you say,</v>

715
00:25:19.219 --> 00:25:21.919
down the street with some fluidity and grace?

716
00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:24.079
It's so beautiful when you watch this--

717
00:25:24.079 --> 00:25:25.430
<v ->And make it part of your every movement.</v>

718
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.908
<v Voiceover>Very true.</v>

719
00:25:25.908 --> 00:25:27.051
<v ->It's just every day.</v>

720
00:25:27.051 --> 00:25:28.898
I mean it's great to workout or do whatever discipline

721
00:25:28.898 --> 00:25:30.919
you do, but do it with mindfulness,

722
00:25:30.919 --> 00:25:33.580
and then bring the quality of your mindful workout

723
00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.901
into how you open a door.

724
00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:36.980
<v Voiceover>How you cook.</v>

725
00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:39.640
<v ->How you cook, and how you walk down the street.</v>

726
00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.262
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

727
00:25:40.262 --> 00:25:42.971
<v ->It's also true those extremes about the view</v>

728
00:25:42.971 --> 00:25:44.052
towards sexuality.

729
00:25:44.052 --> 00:25:44.870
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

730
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:49.593
<v ->It's either pornography and just vile obscenity</v>

731
00:25:49.593 --> 00:25:52.589
or utter repression, guilt, and misery.

732
00:25:52.589 --> 00:25:53.189
<v Voiceover>Wait.</v>

733
00:25:53.189 --> 00:25:54.288
Yeah, wait, abstinence.

734
00:25:54.288 --> 00:25:55.069
Yes.

735
00:25:55.069 --> 00:25:59.135
<v ->Where's just a healthy, natural flowing balance?</v>

736
00:25:59.135 --> 00:26:00.682
We need all the help we can get.

737
00:26:00.682 --> 00:26:01.663
<v Voiceover>Boy we do.</v>

738
00:26:01.663 --> 00:26:02.723
(laughter)

739
00:26:02.723 --> 00:26:03.886
Across the board.

740
00:26:04.996 --> 00:26:06.765
And we come to our seventh point,

741
00:26:06.765 --> 00:26:09.285
which is more or less, the way interpreted that is,

742
00:26:09.285 --> 00:26:12.864
is having the gratitude, having the recognition

743
00:26:12.864 --> 00:26:16.145
of all that is interconnected of the dance of life.

744
00:26:16.145 --> 00:26:17.085
<v ->Yes.</v>

745
00:26:17.085 --> 00:26:18.205
Connessione.

746
00:26:18.205 --> 00:26:18.824
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

747
00:26:18.824 --> 00:26:20.445
<v ->Connessione, everything connects to everything else.</v>

748
00:26:20.445 --> 00:26:21.843
Leonardo wrote in his notebook,

749
00:26:21.843 --> 00:26:24.123
"Everything connects to everything else."

750
00:26:24.123 --> 00:26:27.233
You know the famous systems thinking question

751
00:26:27.233 --> 00:26:30.850
asked by the meteorologist Lawrence in 1911,

752
00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:34.090
"If a butterfly flaps its wings in Tokyo,

753
00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:35.790
"does it affect the weather in New York?"

754
00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:36.471
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

755
00:26:36.471 --> 00:26:39.348
<v ->Modern system science says, "Of course, yes it does."</v>

756
00:26:39.348 --> 00:26:43.088
500 years ago, Leonardo wrote in his notebook,

757
00:26:43.088 --> 00:26:46.188
"When the tiniest bird alights on the smallest branch,

758
00:26:46.188 --> 00:26:48.246
"the whole world is affected thus."

759
00:26:48.246 --> 00:26:49.366
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

760
00:26:49.366 --> 00:26:50.764
<v ->Everything connects to everything else.</v>

761
00:26:50.764 --> 00:26:53.784
And that's what he's showing us in everything he touched

762
00:26:53.784 --> 00:26:56.903
is this amazing vision of wholeness.

763
00:26:56.903 --> 00:26:58.883
That everything connects to everything else.

764
00:26:58.883 --> 00:27:02.163
He painted the Adoration of the Magi when he was in his 20s.

765
00:27:02.163 --> 00:27:03.184
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

766
00:27:03.184 --> 00:27:04.564
<v ->He was criticized for many years</v>

767
00:27:04.564 --> 00:27:07.304
for leaving it unfinished, which is fine.

768
00:27:07.304 --> 00:27:09.423
Until you understand what he was trying to do

769
00:27:09.423 --> 00:27:11.044
in that painting, which was to express

770
00:27:11.044 --> 00:27:13.824
all of human knowledge on one canvass.

771
00:27:13.824 --> 00:27:15.104
(laughter)

772
00:27:15.104 --> 00:27:16.262
<v Voiceover>And underlying all of this</v>

773
00:27:16.262 --> 00:27:19.622
are other principles and we're going to be covering those

774
00:27:19.622 --> 00:27:23.062
in a different interview, where you get into the geometrical

775
00:27:23.062 --> 00:27:25.501
foundation and building blocks of life,

776
00:27:25.501 --> 00:27:28.222
which was so critical to,

777
00:27:28.222 --> 00:27:30.652
sounds like just about everything that he did.

778
00:27:30.652 --> 00:27:33.261
<v ->Well he understood that, attempted to express it.</v>

779
00:27:33.261 --> 00:27:33.805
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

780
00:27:33.805 --> 00:27:35.410
<v ->It's in all of his artwork.</v>

781
00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:37.630
It's in the famous Canon of Proportion figure

782
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:40.825
used as a symbol of human wholeness around the world.

783
00:27:40.825 --> 00:27:42.743
But the great thing about this is this is not just

784
00:27:42.743 --> 00:27:46.603
a theoretical, inspiring notion.

785
00:27:46.603 --> 00:27:51.083
These are practical principles, where you can actually

786
00:27:51.083 --> 00:27:55.070
do things differently in alignment with these principles.

787
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:56.968
You can learn, for example,

788
00:27:56.968 --> 00:27:59.425
to make mind maps,

789
00:27:59.425 --> 00:28:02.905
which is a way to think like Leonardo.

790
00:28:02.905 --> 00:28:05.325
Instead of doing linear note-taking,

791
00:28:05.325 --> 00:28:08.941
and putting things in top-down sequence,

792
00:28:08.941 --> 00:28:11.461
which is a great way of thinking about the box of thinking,

793
00:28:11.461 --> 00:28:14.311
where you prematurely organize,

794
00:28:14.311 --> 00:28:16.737
you can do a little sketch.

795
00:28:16.737 --> 00:28:17.677
Just a simple doodle.

796
00:28:17.677 --> 00:28:19.099
You don't have to draw like Leonardo

797
00:28:19.099 --> 00:28:20.239
to do a mind map.

798
00:28:20.239 --> 00:28:22.117
And then from there, go off in different directions.

799
00:28:22.117 --> 00:28:22.615
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

800
00:28:22.615 --> 00:28:24.493
<v ->And all of a sudden, you're freed from the box,</v>

801
00:28:24.493 --> 00:28:26.711
and you're accessing the artistic part of your mind

802
00:28:26.711 --> 00:28:28.471
and the logical part of your mind,

803
00:28:28.471 --> 00:28:32.689
and you can apply this to your personal life plan,

804
00:28:32.689 --> 00:28:34.447
to solving your most important problems.

805
00:28:34.447 --> 00:28:36.805
I do it with my business clients to write their strategic

806
00:28:36.805 --> 00:28:40.845
plans, to do their values and their mission statements,

807
00:28:42.315 --> 00:28:45.523
to even design recruiting and hiring programs,

808
00:28:45.523 --> 00:28:49.021
and you'll get more work done in less time.

809
00:28:49.021 --> 00:28:51.179
You'll integrate logic and imagination.

810
00:28:51.179 --> 00:28:53.980
You'll make connections that you would never have seen

811
00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.640
otherwise, and you'll be thinking like Leonardo.

812
00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:57.339
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

813
00:28:57.339 --> 00:28:59.835
And a lot of this is delineated in this book.

814
00:28:59.835 --> 00:29:01.313
<v ->This is all in How to Think Like Leonardo--</v>

815
00:29:01.313 --> 00:29:02.095
<v Voiceover>That's all in How to Think Like--</v>

816
00:29:02.095 --> 00:29:04.533
<v ->How to Think Like Leonardo focuses on the creative</v>

817
00:29:04.533 --> 00:29:06.333
applications of these ideas,

818
00:29:06.333 --> 00:29:08.433
and then my more recent book,

819
00:29:08.433 --> 00:29:09.793
Da Vinci Decoded,

820
00:29:09.793 --> 00:29:12.793
Discovering the Spiritual Secrets of Leonardo's

821
00:29:12.793 --> 00:29:17.773
Seven Principles, focuses in on the spiritual implications

822
00:29:17.773 --> 00:29:21.680
of Leonardo's work, beneath all the mumbo jumbo

823
00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.315
the people are talking about as a result of that novel.

824
00:29:24.315 --> 00:29:24.913
What's the name of it?

825
00:29:24.913 --> 00:29:25.770
I forget.

826
00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:27.450
(laughing)

827
00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:28.830
<v Voiceover>Oh, I know you have it.</v>

828
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:29.711
(laughter)

829
00:29:29.711 --> 00:29:30.988
Hint, there's a movie.

830
00:29:30.988 --> 00:29:34.983
<v ->But that all distracts from the real meaning</v>

831
00:29:34.983 --> 00:29:37.922
of Leonardo's, what he was pointing to spiritually,

832
00:29:37.922 --> 00:29:42.363
which is truly profound, integrates the great esoteric

833
00:29:42.363 --> 00:29:43.903
traditions of the world.

834
00:29:43.903 --> 00:29:46.662
It's all within those seven principles that we discussed.

835
00:29:46.662 --> 00:29:51.162
It's coded into his art, and I try in Da Vinci Decoded

836
00:29:51.162 --> 00:29:53.429
to draw that out for the reader,

837
00:29:53.429 --> 00:29:55.428
and help them understand how it might apply

838
00:29:55.428 --> 00:29:57.149
to their own spiritual quest.

839
00:29:57.149 --> 00:29:58.206
<v Voiceover>Mhmm.</v>

840
00:29:58.206 --> 00:30:00.385
Well, you've done beautiful work.

841
00:30:00.385 --> 00:30:02.065
Thank you so much for taking time.

842
00:30:02.065 --> 00:30:03.765
I know everybody's on the run here.

843
00:30:03.765 --> 00:30:06.285
And, we should get back to this again

844
00:30:06.285 --> 00:30:09.565
in a little bit, and do part two.

845
00:30:09.565 --> 00:30:10.465
The next book.

846
00:30:10.465 --> 00:30:11.301
<v ->Sounds like fun, good.</v>

847
00:30:11.301 --> 00:30:12.185
<v Voiceover>Thank you so much.</v>

848
00:30:12.185 --> 00:30:12.743
<v ->OK, my pleasure.</v>

849
00:30:12.743 --> 00:30:13.802
Thank you.

850
00:30:13.802 --> 00:30:15.489
(lively piano music)

851
00:30:15.489 --> 00:30:17.949
<v ->I highly recommend you pick up a copy of his book.</v>

852
00:30:17.949 --> 00:30:20.709
Along with the chart he offers for mind mapping your work

853
00:30:20.709 --> 00:30:21.689
and your life,

854
00:30:21.689 --> 00:30:24.528
this is one that if you truly take these words to heart,

855
00:30:24.528 --> 00:30:27.129
could be the difference in the quality of how you live

856
00:30:27.129 --> 00:30:28.629
the rest of your life.

857
00:30:28.629 --> 00:30:30.949
Until next time, thanks for watching.

858
00:30:30.949 --> 00:30:35.399
(lively, bouncy music)
