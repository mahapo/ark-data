1
00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:02.709
<v ->It's been a few years since we spoke with</v>

2
00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:04.749
Dannion Brinkley, the man who survived

3
00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:07.268
two lightning strikes, open heart surgery,

4
00:00:07.268 --> 00:00:10.368
and brain surgery and having near death experiences

5
00:00:10.368 --> 00:00:11.828
during each event.

6
00:00:11.828 --> 00:00:13.108
His books have become renowned

7
00:00:13.108 --> 00:00:14.549
because of his down-to-earth way

8
00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.809
of explaining the visions of what he saw

9
00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:19.648
on the other side, many of them from the future.

10
00:00:19.648 --> 00:00:21.509
Well, the future has drawn ever near,

11
00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.269
and Dannion is speaking out.

12
00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.068
The topics of this conversation are some looming events

13
00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:28.668
and the transition into physical death.

14
00:00:28.668 --> 00:00:31.649
He knows this well and he and his Twilight Brigade

15
00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.978
sit at the bedsides of dying veterans every day.

16
00:00:44.408 --> 00:00:46.248
<v ->When you look back over the history</v>

17
00:00:46.248 --> 00:00:47.848
of the spiritual movement,

18
00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:49.809
it goes back into the ancient times

19
00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.328
but the late 1890s all the way to today,

20
00:00:53.328 --> 00:00:55.689
through the 20s and the 30s and.

21
00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:57.668
I got into it from having a near death experience

22
00:00:57.668 --> 00:00:59.789
and I call it the swammy business.

23
00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.309
And it was the mechanism that I could get

24
00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.668
my message out and then to evolve the recruiting

25
00:01:05.668 --> 00:01:07.308
of hospice volunteers

26
00:01:07.308 --> 00:01:08.668
which is like what I want to do

27
00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:11.668
because I want to take over Western medicine.

28
00:01:11.668 --> 00:01:13.109
And if you start with death,

29
00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:15.388
and you back engineer it by using

30
00:01:15.388 --> 00:01:17.729
complimenting alternative medical policy,

31
00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.417
good energetic science,

32
00:01:19.417 --> 00:01:22.278
and the human application to the delivery,

33
00:01:22.278 --> 00:01:24.238
the quality and assurance of end of life

34
00:01:24.238 --> 00:01:28.008
will become a hallmark of the American medical system.

35
00:01:28.737 --> 00:01:32.177
And so coming to this conference,

36
00:01:32.177 --> 00:01:36.318
I believe that the Science and Consciousness Conference

37
00:01:38.038 --> 00:01:40.011
will be the landmark of the heralder

38
00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:44.052
of the next period of dissemination of information.

39
00:01:44.052 --> 00:01:47.011
I believe your program and what you and Scott are doing

40
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:48.791
is the same.

41
00:01:48.791 --> 00:01:52.251
People are desperately looking for this information

42
00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:54.811
because inwardly as great powerful and mighty

43
00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:58.211
spiritual beings with dignity, direction, and purpose,

44
00:01:58.211 --> 00:02:01.591
because of where we are in this part of history,

45
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:03.671
and because of where we are in the breakdown of

46
00:02:03.671 --> 00:02:04.992
the Mayan calendar,

47
00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:08.291
the dawn of the new age and the last 150 years

48
00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:11.830
of an energetic transfer from the galactic center

49
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.829
based on quantum dynamics in a theoretical perspective

50
00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.569
that somebody said 1500 years ago.

51
00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.069
With all that jabber,

52
00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.030
it's still true.

53
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.829
It's happening.

54
00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.969
Well, that's the universe doing something.

55
00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:32.349
That our solar system, a little stupid planet,

56
00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.249
a little tiny planet in the middle of a dwarf star,

57
00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:37.289
the littlest star in the universe,

58
00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:40.130
out here in a galaxy with 1.1 billion

59
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.710
planets and stars in it,

60
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.467
moving in a processional through the constellation.

61
00:02:45.467 --> 00:02:47.127
Somebody ought to better prove

62
00:02:47.127 --> 00:02:48.927
that that's happening.

63
00:02:48.927 --> 00:02:50.247
In all of science,

64
00:02:50.247 --> 00:02:52.487
that's the basic question of the Mayan calendar.

65
00:02:52.487 --> 00:02:53.287
<v Woman>It is, and they,</v>

66
00:02:53.287 --> 00:02:54.427
they're pretty much proving it.

67
00:02:54.427 --> 00:02:58.068
There is fabulous science on it now, it's indisputable.

68
00:02:58.068 --> 00:03:01.077
<v ->And so then what does that mean to us today?</v>

69
00:03:01.077 --> 00:03:03.025
The people of the science and consciousness movement,

70
00:03:03.025 --> 00:03:04.984
your network, your listeners.

71
00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:08.484
We better pay attention

72
00:03:08.484 --> 00:03:11.460
because if it's about being able to elevate

73
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.621
our consciousness because a wave of cosmic energy

74
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:16.260
is moving through the universe,

75
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.280
they call it dark matter, they can measure it now,

76
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.170
it has names, it has patterns,

77
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.960
it moves, it's subatomic,

78
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.980
it's got an anti-matter perspective to it.

79
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.300
I mean all the criteria that you

80
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.801
have to accept its validity.

81
00:03:28.801 --> 00:03:32.561
Well, then, what are we doing about that?

82
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:34.520
<v Woman>How are we responding to it?</v>

83
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.281
If you look at the state of affairs,

84
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:39.610
it looks like at face value we haven't been responding

85
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.920
very well or at least quickly enough

86
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.100
on some levels.

87
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.580
<v ->I would agree I think the system is a failure.</v>

88
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.046
You know, it's a failure.

89
00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:51.366
But it's not beyond repair.

90
00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:55.487
And it's not beyond the point of where

91
00:03:55.487 --> 00:03:58.706
peoples' spiritual selves and Americans, you know,

92
00:03:58.706 --> 00:04:01.546
a part of the spiritual context that we hold

93
00:04:01.546 --> 00:04:03.647
as a strength within us.

94
00:04:03.647 --> 00:04:06.487
I mean, all of us hold that we're an American with strength,

95
00:04:06.487 --> 00:04:08.206
and no matter how much the world hates us today,

96
00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:11.187
we are still the rocking rollest country ever been,

97
00:04:11.187 --> 00:04:12.937
even against China and India,

98
00:04:12.937 --> 00:04:14.547
those development countries,

99
00:04:14.547 --> 00:04:16.782
even down with that lack and flair in Brazil.

100
00:04:16.782 --> 00:04:20.221
Still America makes it happen because we're everybody.

101
00:04:20.221 --> 00:04:21.842
<v Woman>Yeah, we're a mixture of everybody.</v>

102
00:04:21.842 --> 00:04:23.902
<v ->Yeah, we're everybody, and we get all kinds of opinions</v>

103
00:04:23.902 --> 00:04:26.062
and attitudes and all that.

104
00:04:26.062 --> 00:04:29.602
But we can change anything and this is it.

105
00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:32.981
This is where the defining psychology has to put in play.

106
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.241
If the cosmic effect is in play,

107
00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:37.761
and it was the Mayans, well.

108
00:04:37.761 --> 00:04:41.021
The Mayans invented the zero,

109
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:44.141
now where would Bill Gates be if it wasn't for the Mayans?

110
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:45.641
<v Woman>(laughs) You're right.</v>

111
00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:47.141
<v ->That's what these people were doing,</v>

112
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:49.791
building these magnificent cities,

113
00:04:49.791 --> 00:04:51.928
but this is just one point.

114
00:04:51.928 --> 00:04:55.168
That's just one point of the overall viewpoint

115
00:04:55.168 --> 00:04:57.388
that this is our opportunity.

116
00:04:57.388 --> 00:04:59.728
Then you try to apply that cosmic consciousness

117
00:04:59.728 --> 00:05:01.988
that you just put into probability

118
00:05:01.988 --> 00:05:04.568
because of science and quantum physics and astrophysics

119
00:05:04.568 --> 00:05:07.928
and geological surveys and blah blah blah blah blah.

120
00:05:07.928 --> 00:05:09.548
Then you try to put that all into context,

121
00:05:09.548 --> 00:05:14.529
now how does that apply to like every day

122
00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:15.769
in that context?

123
00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:16.979
And I think that's what everybody is

124
00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.220
really looking for in it.

125
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.279
Well I'll put it in that context for you.

126
00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:25.268
This is April Fool's Day I think.

127
00:05:25.268 --> 00:05:27.389
But if you think back two years ago,

128
00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.249
and you could imagine that a half black man

129
00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:34.528
and a half white man and a white woman could be running

130
00:05:34.528 --> 00:05:37.948
for the presidency of the United States of America.

131
00:05:37.948 --> 00:05:39.548
At the moment you realize that,

132
00:05:39.548 --> 00:05:41.128
you realize you don't live in the same country

133
00:05:41.128 --> 00:05:44.028
that you lived in for the 227 years it had existed

134
00:05:44.028 --> 00:05:45.467
before that day.

135
00:05:45.467 --> 00:05:47.168
End of story, I don't care talked about,

136
00:05:47.168 --> 00:05:48.596
who you are, what your momma's name is,

137
00:05:48.596 --> 00:05:49.876
I don't give a crap.

138
00:05:49.876 --> 00:05:51.136
It don't change anything.

139
00:05:51.136 --> 00:05:52.616
Then you have the new guard.

140
00:05:52.616 --> 00:05:54.056
The position what the Democrats are doing

141
00:05:54.056 --> 00:05:55.297
and the Independents.

142
00:05:55.297 --> 00:05:57.216
Then you have the old guard.

143
00:05:57.216 --> 00:06:00.857
Well who ever wins the presidency? United States.

144
00:06:00.857 --> 00:06:03.837
And what happens in this next four years to 2012

145
00:06:03.837 --> 00:06:06.457
will determine the next 100 years of American history.

146
00:06:06.457 --> 00:06:08.016
And it will be war, it'll be peace.

147
00:06:08.016 --> 00:06:10.556
And that's where we are, that's what today is.

148
00:06:10.556 --> 00:06:14.426
And you can talk all you want, maybe that day won't come,

149
00:06:14.426 --> 00:06:17.846
or maybe we're going to be in Iraq a hundred years.

150
00:06:17.846 --> 00:06:20.705
If we in Iraq 100 years, we're in a world war.

151
00:06:20.705 --> 00:06:22.846
<v Woman>Yes indeed, and we're going to talk about that.</v>

152
00:06:22.846 --> 00:06:25.306
And we're going to talk about the spiritual fallout of war.

153
00:06:25.306 --> 00:06:27.546
And this is something that is,

154
00:06:27.546 --> 00:06:30.106
something you participate in every single day

155
00:06:30.106 --> 00:06:33.326
with veterans as they're passing through to

156
00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:36.165
the other dimensions at the end of their lives.

157
00:06:36.165 --> 00:06:38.265
First of all, can we put a couple of things in context?

158
00:06:38.265 --> 00:06:40.105
Because when these events happened to you

159
00:06:40.105 --> 00:06:42.845
back in the mid-70s you were shown a great deal

160
00:06:42.845 --> 00:06:45.836
of information about the future.

161
00:06:45.846 --> 00:06:47.525
<v ->Well I didn't know at the point.</v>

162
00:06:47.525 --> 00:06:48.525
Let me say this.

163
00:06:48.525 --> 00:06:49.965
I didn't know it was the future.

164
00:06:49.965 --> 00:06:51.125
<v Woman>You were just shown information.</v>

165
00:06:51.125 --> 00:06:53.665
<v ->I never had a near death experience before, okay?</v>

166
00:06:53.665 --> 00:06:56.045
I wouldn't have believed it if somebody was

167
00:06:56.045 --> 00:06:57.286
telling me about it.

168
00:06:57.286 --> 00:06:58.786
But it happened to me.

169
00:06:58.786 --> 00:07:02.225
Okay, it was the most real event that I had ever seen or had

170
00:07:02.225 --> 00:07:05.893
and I had to live with it a year without Raymond.

171
00:07:05.893 --> 00:07:09.233
It didn't have a name, it wasn't an NDE then.

172
00:07:09.233 --> 00:07:10.453
<v Woman>Before Raymond Moody came along</v>

173
00:07:10.453 --> 00:07:11.253
and started documenting it.

174
00:07:11.253 --> 00:07:12.033
<v ->With his book, you know.</v>

175
00:07:12.033 --> 00:07:12.974
And if it hadn't been for Raymond Moody,

176
00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:14.012
I would have never made it.

177
00:07:14.012 --> 00:07:14.952
<v Woman>Right.</v>

178
00:07:14.952 --> 00:07:16.251
<v ->That companionship and that friendship</v>

179
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:18.252
through that turbulent period of adjusting

180
00:07:18.252 --> 00:07:20.389
to realizing that 85% you've ever been told

181
00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:23.330
is a bold faced out and out lie.

182
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.129
<v Woman>That's hard.</v>

183
00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:27.409
<v ->And most of it is ridiculous when you stop</v>

184
00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:30.110
to think about it for a minute.

185
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.076
What?

186
00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:33.976
<v Woman>(laughs) What? It's true.</v>

187
00:07:33.976 --> 00:07:34.857
<v ->Yeah.</v>

188
00:07:34.857 --> 00:07:35.977
<v Woman>Well, but, can.</v>

189
00:07:35.977 --> 00:07:39.247
Would you mind talking about some of the things you saw

190
00:07:39.247 --> 00:07:40.926
that are now starting to play out?

191
00:07:40.926 --> 00:07:42.316
And you couldn't make sense of them then

192
00:07:42.316 --> 00:07:43.705
as you said, you didn't know what they were about?

193
00:07:43.705 --> 00:07:45.035
<v ->It was Raymond that made sense of them.</v>

194
00:07:45.035 --> 00:07:47.354
I didn't make sense of them. It was Raymond.

195
00:07:47.354 --> 00:07:49.335
<v ->Well let's talk about some of the specifics</v>

196
00:07:49.335 --> 00:07:50.574
that are affecting us right now.

197
00:07:50.574 --> 00:07:52.545
You were looking at a time.

198
00:07:52.545 --> 00:07:55.722
Am I clear that you saw gas up at $5 a gallon?

199
00:07:55.722 --> 00:07:56.462
<v ->Oh yeah.</v>

200
00:07:56.462 --> 00:07:58.023
I mean, I predicted this in '75,

201
00:07:58.023 --> 00:08:01.422
and when '76 came along and oil prices are right now

202
00:08:01.422 --> 00:08:03.842
where they are except the dollar wasn't devaluated,

203
00:08:03.842 --> 00:08:04.843
and then people said,

204
00:08:04.843 --> 00:08:06.282
"Well okay, that's come true then."

205
00:08:06.282 --> 00:08:07.262
And I said, "No, no no."

206
00:08:07.262 --> 00:08:08.643
"It's 20, 30 years from now."

207
00:08:08.643 --> 00:08:12.153
I mean when you watch the flow of these boxes,

208
00:08:12.153 --> 00:08:15.102
they're not in chronological order.

209
00:08:15.102 --> 00:08:18.611
They're in the order of effect,

210
00:08:18.611 --> 00:08:21.751
how it is affected, the ebb and flow of occurrence,

211
00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:24.531
like probable possibilities.

212
00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:27.591
But like Chernobyl, I could see it and watch it.

213
00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:28.951
And I could smell all the stuff

214
00:08:28.951 --> 00:08:30.971
and this is like 10 years away.

215
00:08:30.971 --> 00:08:33.451
It's 10 years away but it doesn't go away.

216
00:08:33.451 --> 00:08:36.071
It doesn't go away and watching like now.

217
00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:39.072
I said that there would be an environmental religion.

218
00:08:39.072 --> 00:08:41.371
I said this in '76.

219
00:08:41.371 --> 00:08:43.111
I said there would become an environmental religion

220
00:08:43.111 --> 00:08:44.912
and tree huggers and nature lovers,

221
00:08:44.912 --> 00:08:49.430
something would drive them into a point of creating

222
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.570
an environmental religion.

223
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:53.789
And it was the best that I could deduce it from,

224
00:08:53.789 --> 00:08:56.009
is I'd go back and think through that box.

225
00:08:56.009 --> 00:08:58.529
Now 33 years later, I'm a lot smarter

226
00:08:58.529 --> 00:09:01.230
about those visions now than I was then.

227
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.889
And I can see that it's about probable possibilities, but.

228
00:09:04.889 --> 00:09:08.729
Was I right about an environmental religion? Yes.

229
00:09:08.729 --> 00:09:13.709
Benedict four weeks ago made it a sin to pollute.

230
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.832
Now dominion over the earth is becoming responsibility.

231
00:09:17.832 --> 00:09:20.653
The true nature of the Pagan perspective.

232
00:09:20.653 --> 00:09:23.813
Now I read the edict.

233
00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:26.933
And I took the piece out of the New York Times.

234
00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:28.672
And that's an environmental religion.

235
00:09:28.672 --> 00:09:31.913
<v Woman>That is, that really, truly was more correct</v>

236
00:09:31.913 --> 00:09:33.675
than you could have ever guessed.

237
00:09:33.675 --> 00:09:35.261
That's amazing.

238
00:09:35.261 --> 00:09:37.131
<v ->Yeah, but it just shows what.</v>

239
00:09:37.131 --> 00:09:39.178
<v Woman>It shows that you were given the essence.</v>

240
00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:41.457
<v ->It shows you how cool the spiritual world is.</v>

241
00:09:41.457 --> 00:09:42.598
<v Woman>Yes it does.</v>

242
00:09:42.598 --> 00:09:45.998
<v ->Screw me. It's how cool the spiritual world is.</v>

243
00:09:45.998 --> 00:09:48.397
<v Woman>Can we talk about a couple more of those?</v>

244
00:09:48.397 --> 00:09:50.337
There are a couple other things that have come around

245
00:09:50.337 --> 00:09:52.198
lately and just then we'll be done with that.

246
00:09:52.198 --> 00:09:53.537
I just want to get that down.

247
00:09:53.537 --> 00:09:55.198
<v ->Well I think the one that's the most important, you know.</v>

248
00:09:55.198 --> 00:09:59.887
There's a lot of conspiracy and we would be,

249
00:09:59.887 --> 00:10:03.395
because of this mindset of the Book of Revelations.

250
00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:05.135
The Revelation of John.

251
00:10:05.135 --> 00:10:07.296
Because we manifest our reality,

252
00:10:07.296 --> 00:10:09.896
a lot of those mindsets would be put into play.

253
00:10:09.896 --> 00:10:12.116
But they're not as significant

254
00:10:12.116 --> 00:10:14.196
like the environmental religion.

255
00:10:14.196 --> 00:10:17.356
That is the most astounding thing for me

256
00:10:17.356 --> 00:10:18.696
in a long, long time.

257
00:10:18.696 --> 00:10:20.115
<v Woman>Yes. That's amazing.</v>

258
00:10:20.115 --> 00:10:21.775
<v ->To watch that unfold and then I can anticipate</v>

259
00:10:21.775 --> 00:10:24.236
based on probable possibility and my ability to look

260
00:10:24.236 --> 00:10:26.295
at life from the dead side,

261
00:10:26.295 --> 00:10:30.150
from looking from over here back over there.

262
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.078
Then I can look to see that that stuff will

263
00:10:32.078 --> 00:10:33.417
come into play.

264
00:10:33.417 --> 00:10:35.003
And it's here.

265
00:10:35.003 --> 00:10:38.423
So for me, it had nothing to do with religion.

266
00:10:38.423 --> 00:10:40.903
It had to do with a spirituality of a transformation

267
00:10:40.903 --> 00:10:44.003
that was inherent and those who have

268
00:10:44.003 --> 00:10:46.283
bastized it or controlled and manipulated it,

269
00:10:46.283 --> 00:10:48.523
no force could allow them to have to now

270
00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:50.664
as the energy begins to correct itself,

271
00:10:50.664 --> 00:10:52.143
there's nothing they can do.

272
00:10:52.143 --> 00:10:52.984
<v Woman>Right.</v>

273
00:10:52.984 --> 00:10:54.604
<v ->You know, like the borg and the Star Trek,</v>

274
00:10:54.604 --> 00:10:56.284
you will be assimilated.

275
00:10:56.284 --> 00:11:00.464
<v Woman>Yes. (laughs)</v>

276
00:11:00.464 --> 00:11:03.662
That's amazing. That's amazing that it was so clear.

277
00:11:03.662 --> 00:11:04.912
<v ->And that we would go broke as a nation.</v>

278
00:11:04.912 --> 00:11:05.902
This is the other one.

279
00:11:05.902 --> 00:11:07.070
But this is not the most important.

280
00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.271
I just want to cover the horrifying stuff.

281
00:11:09.271 --> 00:11:11.930
That we would go broke, and that people would be homeless,

282
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.910
and streeting and lining up in soup kitchens.

283
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.150
Well we're $9 trillion in debt.

284
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.800
We spend $720 million a day

285
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.139
in a war we're fighting in Iraq

286
00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:23.339
that we borrowed from the Chinese.

287
00:11:23.339 --> 00:11:24.359
<v Woman>That's right.</v>

288
00:11:24.359 --> 00:11:26.199
<v ->Now we borrow $3 billion a day</v>

289
00:11:26.199 --> 00:11:27.819
and we spend $720 million.

290
00:11:27.819 --> 00:11:29.278
<v Woman>And on the CIA,</v>

291
00:11:29.278 --> 00:11:32.038
their own statistical list of world economies,

292
00:11:32.038 --> 00:11:35.598
out of 164 countries, we've been at the bottom, last,

293
00:11:35.598 --> 00:11:37.858
for at least the last couple of years.

294
00:11:37.858 --> 00:11:39.228
<v ->Well since 2001, but.</v>

295
00:11:39.228 --> 00:11:40.678
<v Woman>We're so far in debt, yes.</v>

296
00:11:40.678 --> 00:11:41.666
<v ->But we've positioned.</v>

297
00:11:41.666 --> 00:11:43.525
The way when we saw that coming to rationalize,

298
00:11:43.525 --> 00:11:45.425
we would use 9/11.

299
00:11:45.425 --> 00:11:49.585
And the policies didn't play out because

300
00:11:51.355 --> 00:11:52.501
American politics.

301
00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:55.181
<v Woman>Right. You needn't say more on that.</v>

302
00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:59.950
Most everybody watching this gets that drift. So.

303
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.163
<v ->So America going bankrupt. Well, we're there.</v>

304
00:12:02.163 --> 00:12:03.283
<v Woman>Yeah.</v>

305
00:12:03.283 --> 00:12:05.183
<v ->Okay, we're the Walmart.</v>

306
00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:06.443
We're the Walmart of the world

307
00:12:06.443 --> 00:12:08.423
and we have to collapse the currency.

308
00:12:08.423 --> 00:12:10.143
It has to happen in order to position

309
00:12:10.143 --> 00:12:11.563
the North American states.

310
00:12:11.563 --> 00:12:13.383
<v Woman>Did you see something like that happening?</v>

311
00:12:13.882 --> 00:12:15.061
Talk about what you saw

312
00:12:15.061 --> 00:12:16.562
because we know about this.

313
00:12:16.562 --> 00:12:20.649
<v ->The world global economy was the end product.</v>

314
00:12:20.649 --> 00:12:23.328
But it was only an aspect of the visions.

315
00:12:23.328 --> 00:12:25.168
You know, these are probable possibilities,

316
00:12:25.168 --> 00:12:27.528
because if we think of certain ways something else happens.

317
00:12:27.528 --> 00:12:29.788
And everything is based per breath,

318
00:12:29.788 --> 00:12:32.808
there is a rhythm being created by humanity

319
00:12:32.808 --> 00:12:34.637
that's used in the breath.

320
00:12:34.637 --> 00:12:37.577
And what bowls and molds us together

321
00:12:37.577 --> 00:12:39.296
as spiritual beings in the human form

322
00:12:39.296 --> 00:12:41.136
is that we breathe.

323
00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:43.716
There's nothing else as long as you're breathing

324
00:12:43.716 --> 00:12:46.258
then you're in the game of the unfoldment

325
00:12:46.258 --> 00:12:48.916
of a mental-physical existence

326
00:12:48.916 --> 00:12:51.396
of an emotional spiritual being operating

327
00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:52.936
within the confines of that.

328
00:12:52.936 --> 00:12:53.636
<v Woman>Right.</v>

329
00:12:53.636 --> 00:12:54.856
<v ->And once you realize that,</v>

330
00:12:54.856 --> 00:12:57.476
then you have a whole new set of parameters

331
00:12:57.476 --> 00:12:59.376
to look at your life by.

332
00:12:59.376 --> 00:13:01.696
You can always try to get people to believe it's,

333
00:13:01.696 --> 00:13:03.442
that they're great powerfully minded spiritual beings

334
00:13:03.442 --> 00:13:05.142
with dignity, direction, and purpose.

335
00:13:05.142 --> 00:13:06.663
So we are broke.

336
00:13:06.663 --> 00:13:08.643
So that prophecy is true this day

337
00:13:08.643 --> 00:13:11.682
and people are homeless because there's 4 million defaults.

338
00:13:11.682 --> 00:13:13.203
Well then there's this.

339
00:13:13.203 --> 00:13:15.642
Energetic medicine.

340
00:13:15.642 --> 00:13:18.602
The term in science called frontier medicine

341
00:13:18.602 --> 00:13:21.343
that everything is energetic.

342
00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:24.102
Our consciousness makes us buy pills

343
00:13:24.102 --> 00:13:25.682
because we're looking for that one thing

344
00:13:25.682 --> 00:13:27.262
that does it so we don't have to be responsible

345
00:13:27.262 --> 00:13:28.883
for anything else.

346
00:13:28.883 --> 00:13:30.922
But when you think of that in the whole perspective

347
00:13:30.922 --> 00:13:32.542
about energy.

348
00:13:32.542 --> 00:13:35.562
Quantum physics says that that pill is energy

349
00:13:35.562 --> 00:13:38.022
that calculates in a certain sacred geometry

350
00:13:38.022 --> 00:13:40.722
in a form that operates with an electrical sphere

351
00:13:40.722 --> 00:13:43.021
that we call the earth and

352
00:13:43.021 --> 00:13:48.021
the physical science and physics model of reality.

353
00:13:49.277 --> 00:13:50.573
End of story.

354
00:13:50.573 --> 00:13:54.702
So energetic medicine under the heading of frontier science

355
00:13:54.702 --> 00:13:58.885
non-local healing will be the rage of the next 4-7 years.

356
00:13:58.885 --> 00:14:00.985
Healthcare is the place where the money is

357
00:14:00.985 --> 00:14:03.605
and where growth is and spirituality is

358
00:14:03.605 --> 00:14:04.804
because it's the dividing moment

359
00:14:04.804 --> 00:14:07.925
between the helpless and those who deserve.

360
00:14:07.925 --> 00:14:09.884
Well right there, no matter who you are

361
00:14:09.884 --> 00:14:11.824
as a nation, if you bring healthcare

362
00:14:11.824 --> 00:14:14.185
not using the focal point of what Hillary's doing

363
00:14:14.185 --> 00:14:15.465
and what John McCain's doing

364
00:14:15.465 --> 00:14:16.884
and all that politics.

365
00:14:16.884 --> 00:14:19.985
You bring to the healthcare as a moral dilemma,

366
00:14:19.985 --> 00:14:24.015
then I believe with all my heart.

367
00:14:24.015 --> 00:14:26.719
Those of us who quietly just look at it like this,

368
00:14:26.719 --> 00:14:28.400
between two people looking at it,

369
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.020
will do what's right

370
00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.640
because there's inherit beauty in every soul

371
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.380
that when called upon it will rise

372
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.640
to that challenge because it's the divinity

373
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.399
is being asked to be represented

374
00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:40.240
as you would know it.

375
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.920
End of story. Quit talking.

376
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.500
You just quit and do it.

377
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.780
I keep getting up from the dead based on that.

378
00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.920
<v Woman>Everything you're talking about that's happened</v>

379
00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.339
and is happening right now,

380
00:14:49.339 --> 00:14:52.230
everything you were shown 30 years ago plus

381
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:53.644
is about this period in time now.

382
00:14:53.644 --> 00:14:55.125
Clearly that's what you're doing here.

383
00:14:55.125 --> 00:14:56.485
That's why you had these experiences.

384
00:14:56.485 --> 00:14:57.344
<v ->Absolutely. No question.</v>

385
00:14:57.344 --> 00:14:58.665
<v Woman>And you have really applied it</v>

386
00:14:58.665 --> 00:15:02.084
in a way that I think is desperately in need

387
00:15:02.084 --> 00:15:04.284
of clarification for all of us.

388
00:15:04.284 --> 00:15:07.305
You sat at the side of dying veterans every day.

389
00:15:07.305 --> 00:15:08.764
We're in a nasty war,

390
00:15:08.764 --> 00:15:10.585
we have a lot of people dying real young

391
00:15:10.585 --> 00:15:12.164
that shouldn't be dying right now.

392
00:15:12.164 --> 00:15:13.644
<v ->Or dying slowly because of injuries.</v>

393
00:15:13.644 --> 00:15:15.425
<v Woman>And dying slowly because of the injuries.</v>

394
00:15:15.425 --> 00:15:17.945
Young people dying slowly.

395
00:15:17.945 --> 00:15:21.425
Not just older vets of World War II but young men.

396
00:15:21.425 --> 00:15:23.765
<v ->61,230 a month.</v>

397
00:15:23.765 --> 00:15:24.965
<v Woman>Yeah.</v>

398
00:15:24.965 --> 00:15:28.765
<v ->When you've been dead and you didn't go to Hell,</v>

399
00:15:28.765 --> 00:15:30.352
and you spend two years learning to walk

400
00:15:30.352 --> 00:15:31.512
and feed yourself,

401
00:15:31.512 --> 00:15:33.731
you know everything about a hospice person.

402
00:15:33.731 --> 00:15:34.672
Because you've been him,

403
00:15:34.672 --> 00:15:37.192
my first hospice patient was me.

404
00:15:37.192 --> 00:15:38.572
Well if you have a near death experience,

405
00:15:38.572 --> 00:15:40.632
you have to, mine,

406
00:15:40.632 --> 00:15:42.172
I can't just feel it.

407
00:15:42.172 --> 00:15:44.152
I have to quantify it and I have to frame it,

408
00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:46.171
put a little box in the way I'm going to think it

409
00:15:46.171 --> 00:15:48.672
so that anything that happens within the context

410
00:15:48.672 --> 00:15:50.792
of its value to me,

411
00:15:50.792 --> 00:15:52.551
it'll automatically come to me and I won't

412
00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:54.171
pay attention to it.

413
00:15:54.171 --> 00:15:59.162
Okay, so when you sit at the bedside,

414
00:15:59.882 --> 00:16:02.154
I'm not afraid of what's going on there.

415
00:16:02.154 --> 00:16:04.153
There's nothing about, I understand the pain,

416
00:16:04.153 --> 00:16:05.294
and I know how to study pain management

417
00:16:05.294 --> 00:16:07.134
because I've been in enormous pain.

418
00:16:07.134 --> 00:16:08.754
Struck by lightning, twice,

419
00:16:08.754 --> 00:16:10.334
open heart surgery and brain surgery.

420
00:16:10.334 --> 00:16:11.254
<v Woman>Yeah and anyone who hasn't seen</v>

421
00:16:11.254 --> 00:16:12.374
our first interview with you,

422
00:16:12.374 --> 00:16:13.894
they need to go back and watch this

423
00:16:13.894 --> 00:16:15.514
because that tells who you are.

424
00:16:15.514 --> 00:16:17.174
<v ->If they want to, it's just.</v>

425
00:16:17.174 --> 00:16:19.153
<v Woman>I think it's good, it's a good interview.</v>

426
00:16:19.153 --> 00:16:21.233
<v ->Well, I just hope they have fun, I don't care.</v>

427
00:16:21.233 --> 00:16:23.954
But when you look at it,

428
00:16:23.954 --> 00:16:25.233
and you're not afraid of it.

429
00:16:25.233 --> 00:16:27.653
Then as a human being,

430
00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:31.949
and as a spiritual being in human form,

431
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:33.990
it's never what happens to you in your life,

432
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:35.552
it's what you do with what happens to you

433
00:16:35.552 --> 00:16:38.470
that's really going to matter about how you correct

434
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:42.361
or handle whatever it is you're doing in your life.

435
00:16:42.891 --> 00:16:44.370
And so I thought that what I could do

436
00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.531
as a personal, personally no matter what

437
00:16:46.531 --> 00:16:48.911
my calls was going to be, was be with those veterans.

438
00:16:48.911 --> 00:16:50.490
Because I am one.

439
00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:53.471
And to be with them because the uniquenesses that come

440
00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:55.371
with them and the conversations they couldn't have

441
00:16:55.371 --> 00:16:58.671
with anybody else that created the stress of alienation

442
00:16:58.671 --> 00:17:02.501
of the family like PTSD and poly brain trauma

443
00:17:02.501 --> 00:17:03.506
and all the things.

444
00:17:03.506 --> 00:17:04.666
<v Woman>Leading to drugs and violence at home</v>

445
00:17:04.666 --> 00:17:05.682
and all kinds of problems.

446
00:17:05.682 --> 00:17:08.362
<v ->Well Agent Orange and the type 2 diabetes</v>

447
00:17:08.362 --> 00:17:09.861
and the loss of limbs, you know.

448
00:17:09.861 --> 00:17:13.822
These things have a tendency to make people crazier

449
00:17:13.822 --> 00:17:15.421
than they would normally be.

450
00:17:15.421 --> 00:17:17.742
<v Woman>Radiation exposure included. All of it.</v>

451
00:17:17.742 --> 00:17:18.841
<v ->Depleted uranium.</v>

452
00:17:18.841 --> 00:17:20.342
<v Woman>Exactly. That's what I'm speaking of.</v>

453
00:17:20.342 --> 00:17:21.181
<v ->The killer.</v>

454
00:17:21.181 --> 00:17:22.062
<v Woman>That's right.</v>

455
00:17:22.062 --> 00:17:23.418
And so we have a lot of young men that are dying

456
00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:24.207
that shouldn't be.

457
00:17:24.207 --> 00:17:25.458
<v ->Well we have a lot of old men too, but.</v>

458
00:17:25.458 --> 00:17:26.414
<v Woman>And, yeah are.</v>

459
00:17:26.414 --> 00:17:27.833
<v ->But what people who have ever served in the military</v>

460
00:17:27.833 --> 00:17:31.774
ask about is if anybody ever appreciates

461
00:17:31.774 --> 00:17:33.204
what they went through.

462
00:17:33.204 --> 00:17:34.325
Because when you're lying in that bed

463
00:17:34.325 --> 00:17:35.944
and you've got six months or less,

464
00:17:35.944 --> 00:17:37.584
the talking's done.

465
00:17:37.584 --> 00:17:39.784
It's evaluating.

466
00:17:39.784 --> 00:17:41.924
People are amazed, okay.

467
00:17:41.924 --> 00:17:43.364
They can't believe it.

468
00:17:43.364 --> 00:17:45.724
And then they go to denial, okay.

469
00:17:45.724 --> 00:17:48.424
This is not happening to me.

470
00:17:48.424 --> 00:17:50.905
Then they go to fits of anger,

471
00:17:50.905 --> 00:17:53.285
within that denial as defense.

472
00:17:53.285 --> 00:17:56.365
And then they start to bargain,

473
00:17:56.365 --> 00:17:58.844
and then it's acceptance.

474
00:17:58.844 --> 00:18:00.564
So it's walking them through those stages

475
00:18:00.564 --> 00:18:02.904
no matter who they are because this is the inherent

476
00:18:02.904 --> 00:18:05.204
nature of spiritual transition.

477
00:18:05.204 --> 00:18:08.124
And define value for that person by their life

478
00:18:08.124 --> 00:18:10.605
had meaning and if you never met them before,

479
00:18:10.605 --> 00:18:12.444
the fact that they served in the military,

480
00:18:12.444 --> 00:18:13.825
I've got something in common with them,

481
00:18:13.825 --> 00:18:15.365
and what branch did you serve in?

482
00:18:15.365 --> 00:18:17.424
If it was the navy you're a squid.

483
00:18:17.424 --> 00:18:19.204
And you hadn't heard anybody call you a squid

484
00:18:19.204 --> 00:18:20.804
in sixty years.

485
00:18:21.844 --> 00:18:24.559
And there was a rapport that begins.

486
00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:26.459
Everybody's different.

487
00:18:26.459 --> 00:18:27.899
There are no two alike

488
00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:31.380
and I've been through 368 of them in their last breath.

489
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.920
And some people I've known six years

490
00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.539
because they happened to keep surviving

491
00:18:35.539 --> 00:18:37.459
because some kind of quality of life

492
00:18:37.459 --> 00:18:40.105
came into their life when they came out of the coma

493
00:18:40.105 --> 00:18:43.784
like Walter that it changed them.

494
00:18:43.784 --> 00:18:46.805
Though I miss the other side.

495
00:18:46.805 --> 00:18:48.565
If you've ever been where I've been,

496
00:18:48.565 --> 00:18:50.865
then there is no part of you that does not always

497
00:18:50.865 --> 00:18:54.064
wonder about it because to feel precious and safe

498
00:18:54.064 --> 00:18:57.145
and to feel that we're really existing,

499
00:18:57.145 --> 00:18:59.125
that somewhere somebody's proud of me

500
00:18:59.125 --> 00:19:01.565
or I wouldn't be able to get there

501
00:19:01.565 --> 00:19:03.804
if there wasn't someone proud of me.

502
00:19:03.804 --> 00:19:06.124
I mean that's the only way it could have happened.

503
00:19:06.124 --> 00:19:09.404
And when you think like that,

504
00:19:09.404 --> 00:19:11.665
then you get to live among the spiritual essences

505
00:19:11.665 --> 00:19:14.565
of a human being in their last days.

506
00:19:14.565 --> 00:19:16.645
And if you know how to handle to guide that person

507
00:19:16.645 --> 00:19:18.224
to help them find value,

508
00:19:18.224 --> 00:19:19.605
because they're a spiritual being

509
00:19:19.605 --> 00:19:21.185
in who they are and what they did

510
00:19:21.185 --> 00:19:24.154
by them telling their story to somebody.

511
00:19:24.154 --> 00:19:27.190
Most people need just a listening, loving presence.

512
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:28.730
What we all hope God is for us,

513
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:30.009
why not become that for others

514
00:19:30.009 --> 00:19:32.150
until that moment occurs?

515
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.310
Until that moment occurs and so what I decided

516
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:37.170
to do was do that.

517
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.670
I did that personally.

518
00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:40.290
It was not a part of the great Dannion

519
00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.850
world conquest adventure.

520
00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:44.850
You know, it wasn't about that.

521
00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.029
It came about when going with my dad

522
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:48.630
over to the VA, I was doing hospice

523
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.830
but not focused on veterans and

524
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.396
my mom had headed to the next side

525
00:19:53.396 --> 00:19:54.715
having the best time she could have,

526
00:19:54.715 --> 00:19:58.516
and my dad, he had to go to the VA.

527
00:19:58.516 --> 00:20:00.435
When you're in the hospital,

528
00:20:00.435 --> 00:20:02.156
and you look at the desperation,

529
00:20:02.156 --> 00:20:05.835
I can empathize with it because I've been there.

530
00:20:06.496 --> 00:20:07.571
And it's not sympathize because

531
00:20:07.571 --> 00:20:09.412
I don't sympathize with anything.

532
00:20:09.412 --> 00:20:11.335
Because that's a stupid action.

533
00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:14.346
Sympathy means you think you're better than it.

534
00:20:14.346 --> 00:20:15.710
That means you will never succeed

535
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.430
in trying to see it properly

536
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:19.811
or execute a plan to achieve support

537
00:20:19.811 --> 00:20:22.291
or change it because you have not framed it

538
00:20:22.291 --> 00:20:25.130
well enough to be able to execute that.

539
00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:26.037
<v Woman>Right.</v>

540
00:20:26.037 --> 00:20:27.046
<v ->End of story, goodbye.</v>

541
00:20:27.046 --> 00:20:28.767
Talk all you want, I don't care.

542
00:20:28.767 --> 00:20:29.907
(laughs) You know.

543
00:20:29.907 --> 00:20:31.067
<v Woman>You strive for empathy.</v>

544
00:20:31.067 --> 00:20:33.207
<v ->Yeah, so empathy is the point where you've been there</v>

545
00:20:33.207 --> 00:20:34.348
and understand it.

546
00:20:34.348 --> 00:20:36.007
And I just started talking to them

547
00:20:36.007 --> 00:20:37.307
and I said, "When's the last time someone"

548
00:20:37.307 --> 00:20:38.288
"came to see you?"

549
00:20:38.288 --> 00:20:41.148
And some guys it's been ten years.

550
00:20:41.148 --> 00:20:43.388
And so I just,

551
00:20:43.388 --> 00:20:47.508
there was a ward and

552
00:20:47.508 --> 00:20:49.029
I went into a VA and there was a ward

553
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:51.669
that nobody would go see anybody in.

554
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:54.329
And they were hospice, and they were AIDS.

555
00:20:54.329 --> 00:20:56.829
It's '84 and no one would go see them.

556
00:20:56.829 --> 00:20:58.290
And everybody thought you got AIDS

557
00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:02.268
if you drove through New York.

558
00:21:02.268 --> 00:21:05.709
And I thought, well if lightning didn't kill me,

559
00:21:05.709 --> 00:21:08.389
okay, and now I hadn't had open heart surgery first.

560
00:21:08.389 --> 00:21:10.709
Then AIDS is not going to kill me.

561
00:21:10.709 --> 00:21:12.748
So I said, "I'll go and see them."

562
00:21:12.748 --> 00:21:14.947
And so there was like, these four navy guys.

563
00:21:14.947 --> 00:21:17.147
They were having a really tough time.

564
00:21:17.147 --> 00:21:21.618
I mean, it's tough dying of AIDS in the '80s.

565
00:21:22.358 --> 00:21:26.476
And serving your country and disdained, and betrayal.

566
00:21:26.476 --> 00:21:28.746
I knew I was going to do something then.

567
00:21:28.746 --> 00:21:29.626
It didn't make any difference

568
00:21:29.626 --> 00:21:32.587
and I saw the nature of God in my life

569
00:21:32.587 --> 00:21:34.427
or the spiritual force in my life

570
00:21:34.427 --> 00:21:37.587
maneuvering me into what it wants me to do.

571
00:21:37.587 --> 00:21:39.126
I was just smart enough from being dead

572
00:21:39.126 --> 00:21:41.927
to be able to catch it. (laughs)

573
00:21:41.927 --> 00:21:44.327
But it didn't change the fact that that's what it was doing.

574
00:21:44.327 --> 00:21:45.166
<v Woman>Yeah.</v>

575
00:21:45.166 --> 00:21:47.491
<v ->And it's just people seeing that part about themselves.</v>

576
00:21:47.491 --> 00:21:50.771
<v Woman>So when you're coming toward the very end,</v>

577
00:21:50.771 --> 00:21:54.292
and the denial is all gone, and the acceptance is there.

578
00:21:54.292 --> 00:21:57.112
<v ->You don't ever know what stage they're in</v>

579
00:21:57.112 --> 00:21:58.352
when they pass.

580
00:21:58.352 --> 00:21:59.231
This is the process of.

581
00:21:59.231 --> 00:22:00.122
<v Woman>But the fear.</v>

582
00:22:00.122 --> 00:22:03.117
Isn't there still a fear aspect in most people?

583
00:22:03.117 --> 00:22:04.737
And what do you notice,

584
00:22:04.737 --> 00:22:06.897
what are the common denominators with these?

585
00:22:06.897 --> 00:22:09.218
<v ->If they're going to Hell or not.</v>

586
00:22:09.218 --> 00:22:10.578
<v Woman>If they're going to Hell.</v>

587
00:22:10.578 --> 00:22:11.637
If they're actually.

588
00:22:11.637 --> 00:22:13.608
<v ->Yeah, when the talking is done.</v>

589
00:22:13.608 --> 00:22:14.976
And the doctor is done.

590
00:22:14.976 --> 00:22:17.337
And the family is not paying any attention.

591
00:22:17.337 --> 00:22:19.317
And to get to come see you is a lot of reasons

592
00:22:19.317 --> 00:22:21.076
they slow down in coming

593
00:22:21.076 --> 00:22:23.816
because a lot of them can't handle what they're seeing.

594
00:22:23.816 --> 00:22:26.957
Robust, all the way to the last of it.

595
00:22:26.957 --> 00:22:28.757
So you don't judge people there.

596
00:22:28.757 --> 00:22:32.117
I don't judge people, I try to fill the gap.

597
00:22:32.117 --> 00:22:34.075
I'm a caregiver's caregiver.

598
00:22:34.075 --> 00:22:35.795
I believe in compassionate fatigue,

599
00:22:35.795 --> 00:22:38.415
and I watch it happen to people who are dying with people.

600
00:22:38.415 --> 00:22:39.875
So I created the Twilight Brigade

601
00:22:39.875 --> 00:22:42.466
to be there to help them.

602
00:22:42.466 --> 00:22:45.193
I teach the framework of what to watch for

603
00:22:45.193 --> 00:22:47.454
and how to listen.

604
00:22:47.454 --> 00:22:49.953
You know, I'm a different person at the bedside

605
00:22:49.953 --> 00:22:53.474
than I am in my Dannion frame or being me

606
00:22:53.474 --> 00:22:55.514
or whatever I'm trying to promote

607
00:22:55.514 --> 00:22:57.573
or my marketing, all that.

608
00:22:57.573 --> 00:22:59.593
At the bedside, because I always say

609
00:22:59.593 --> 00:23:01.693
you teach best what you most need to learn.

610
00:23:01.693 --> 00:23:04.743
It's something I got from Richard Bach

611
00:23:04.743 --> 00:23:07.201
in Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah,

612
00:23:07.201 --> 00:23:08.361
a great book.

613
00:23:08.361 --> 00:23:09.382
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

614
00:23:09.382 --> 00:23:12.552
<v ->And you teach best what you most need to learn.</v>

615
00:23:12.552 --> 00:23:15.690
And so I most need to learn patience.

616
00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:18.231
So I have to lock myself into a system

617
00:23:18.231 --> 00:23:22.170
that demands out of integrity that I do that.

618
00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.351
And that's being at the bedside.

619
00:23:24.351 --> 00:23:26.790
When you know you're a great powerfully minded spiritual

620
00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.690
being and you have dignity, direction and purpose.

621
00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.111
When you know that, no matter where you go.

622
00:23:30.111 --> 00:23:31.850
There's no place I can go from that.

623
00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:33.731
And you don't go to Hell.

624
00:23:33.731 --> 00:23:35.130
And the place that you see on the other side

625
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:37.651
is as cool as you could possibly imagine it.

626
00:23:37.651 --> 00:23:40.050
It's different from all that stuff you've ever heard.

627
00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:43.350
But it's sensual, and it's such a safe place.

628
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:48.350
It's a place where you feel a tremendous pride

629
00:23:49.371 --> 00:23:52.268
that something is feeling about you.

630
00:23:52.268 --> 00:23:54.308
You know that you're instilling pride

631
00:23:54.308 --> 00:23:55.709
in something.

632
00:23:55.709 --> 00:23:56.809
<v Woman>You feel embraced.</v>

633
00:23:56.809 --> 00:23:57.868
<v ->Yeah, more than that.</v>

634
00:23:57.868 --> 00:23:59.269
That it's proud.

635
00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.948
<v Woman>Yeah.</v>

636
00:23:59.948 --> 00:24:01.409
<v ->And that's the force that surrounds you</v>

637
00:24:01.409 --> 00:24:03.729
when you move from this world to the next.

638
00:24:03.729 --> 00:24:06.288
All I ever want people to really do

639
00:24:06.288 --> 00:24:08.948
is to believe there's a life after death.

640
00:24:08.948 --> 00:24:10.748
I do not really care what they believe about.

641
00:24:10.748 --> 00:24:12.249
They can make up anything they want,

642
00:24:12.249 --> 00:24:13.829
and probably anything they make up is true

643
00:24:13.829 --> 00:24:16.909
and possible regardless of what anybody says.

644
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:18.568
Over there you can do anything,

645
00:24:18.568 --> 00:24:20.228
it doesn't matter.

646
00:24:20.228 --> 00:24:21.409
But I wouldn't believe that.

647
00:24:21.409 --> 00:24:23.909
Because if I could in my lifetime

648
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:25.729
create that as a mindset,

649
00:24:25.729 --> 00:24:28.829
then this is not the end of something.

650
00:24:28.829 --> 00:24:32.268
It's the final steps before the beginning of something else.

651
00:24:32.268 --> 00:24:34.628
That will shift the mindset.

652
00:24:34.628 --> 00:24:37.289
And it will shift the mindset subtly.

653
00:24:37.289 --> 00:24:39.428
And it will do it in such a way that

654
00:24:39.428 --> 00:24:42.228
people from me and my life,

655
00:24:42.228 --> 00:24:44.398
and what happened to NDEers.

656
00:24:44.398 --> 00:24:46.998
And those who took that dramatic event

657
00:24:46.998 --> 00:24:48.698
that was so real it matched everything

658
00:24:48.698 --> 00:24:50.157
that's ever occurred,

659
00:24:50.157 --> 00:24:52.297
and they really did something with it.

660
00:24:52.297 --> 00:24:54.077
I'm not saying that those who didn't do anything

661
00:24:54.077 --> 00:24:56.437
with it are any less.

662
00:24:56.437 --> 00:24:57.877
But you can measure the distance

663
00:24:57.877 --> 00:25:00.537
traveled by a person when they talk it

664
00:25:00.537 --> 00:25:02.737
and how well they walk it.

665
00:25:02.737 --> 00:25:06.917
And I hope no matter how screwed up I am

666
00:25:06.917 --> 00:25:09.798
that that will be the mark of wherever else I am,

667
00:25:09.798 --> 00:25:11.617
which I haven't done anything too bad,

668
00:25:11.617 --> 00:25:12.566
but whatever else I am,

669
00:25:12.566 --> 00:25:14.286
this is the mark of what I believe

670
00:25:14.286 --> 00:25:15.534
based on a life after death.

671
00:25:15.534 --> 00:25:18.455
And then you move forward onto the next step.

672
00:25:18.455 --> 00:25:19.914
To look at a managed care system

673
00:25:19.914 --> 00:25:22.099
which is the medical structure of the United States,

674
00:25:22.099 --> 00:25:24.659
look at a managed care system

675
00:25:24.659 --> 00:25:27.540
so that you can implement a strategy

676
00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.860
in end of life care which would take

677
00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.600
the training of the Twilight Brigade

678
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.860
and standardize it as a model.

679
00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.820
Because and the greatest thing about end of life care

680
00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.399
is continuity of care.

681
00:25:38.399 --> 00:25:39.139
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

682
00:25:39.139 --> 00:25:40.419
<v ->Okay consistency because that's what</v>

683
00:25:40.419 --> 00:25:43.180
that person in a helpless state depends on.

684
00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.740
That's one of the failures of the whole system.

685
00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.199
That's why I'm in VAs

686
00:25:47.199 --> 00:25:49.099
because this is where these guys need somebody

687
00:25:49.099 --> 00:25:50.419
to talk to them and the people

688
00:25:50.419 --> 00:25:51.861
are overworked and the bureaucracy

689
00:25:51.861 --> 00:25:54.200
and the standardized model that's in place

690
00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.901
does not allow it to happen.

691
00:25:55.901 --> 00:25:56.721
<v Woman>Right.</v>

692
00:25:56.721 --> 00:25:58.701
<v ->So I have to break that model.</v>

693
00:25:58.701 --> 00:26:00.941
I have to engage it, you know.

694
00:26:00.941 --> 00:26:02.320
<v Woman>And you're having some good luck with that.</v>

695
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.061
They help you where you ask for help.

696
00:26:04.061 --> 00:26:05.801
<v ->Oh well, everybody talks bad about the VA.</v>

697
00:26:05.801 --> 00:26:07.680
And I know everything good and bad about the VA.

698
00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.701
But you know what, everything I ask them to do,

699
00:26:09.701 --> 00:26:11.141
they do it.

700
00:26:11.141 --> 00:26:12.701
I mean, I was out there,

701
00:26:12.701 --> 00:26:15.521
I know the system because I deal with end of life care

702
00:26:15.521 --> 00:26:16.881
and I fight for people's rights

703
00:26:16.881 --> 00:26:19.601
and their DD214s and all this stuff

704
00:26:19.601 --> 00:26:21.321
that has to be done for them to be able

705
00:26:21.321 --> 00:26:22.501
to get their benefits.

706
00:26:22.501 --> 00:26:23.961
And I not only die with them,

707
00:26:23.961 --> 00:26:25.461
I talk to them, and I help them,

708
00:26:25.461 --> 00:26:27.341
and I guide them, and I call their Congressmen,

709
00:26:27.341 --> 00:26:28.801
and I call their Senators,

710
00:26:28.801 --> 00:26:30.601
I threaten people.

711
00:26:30.601 --> 00:26:32.401
Because they need an advocate.

712
00:26:32.401 --> 00:26:33.861
They need somebody that's not trying to,

713
00:26:33.861 --> 00:26:35.181
I don't want anything from them,

714
00:26:35.181 --> 00:26:38.581
they're dying, my wife says I have an intimacy problem.

715
00:26:38.581 --> 00:26:40.821
Because the only people I like are people dying.

716
00:26:40.821 --> 00:26:43.261
Because I don't have to like them long.

717
00:26:43.261 --> 00:26:46.781
Okay and so maybe that's true, okay, but.

718
00:26:46.781 --> 00:26:50.041
Everybody who follows me, they know me.

719
00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:52.321
They don't have any oddity about me.

720
00:26:52.321 --> 00:26:54.281
They know exactly how I am.

721
00:26:54.281 --> 00:26:55.741
They know exactly how I look at it

722
00:26:55.741 --> 00:26:57.621
and I'm as straightforward about it,

723
00:26:57.621 --> 00:26:59.823
and I don't get into all that trivia.

724
00:26:59.823 --> 00:27:03.423
But what we have to do is find a standardized model

725
00:27:03.423 --> 00:27:06.938
that allows death to become a natural process.

726
00:27:07.629 --> 00:27:09.169
You come here going.

727
00:27:09.169 --> 00:27:12.199
Okay now, quit freaking out.

728
00:27:12.199 --> 00:27:14.015
I didn't go to Hell, you ain't going to Hell.

729
00:27:14.015 --> 00:27:15.025
<v Woman>I want to talk to you about that.</v>

730
00:27:15.025 --> 00:27:16.195
<v ->So get that out of the way.</v>

731
00:27:16.195 --> 00:27:18.067
<v Woman>Can we talk about that part right there?</v>

732
00:27:18.067 --> 00:27:21.707
When you have a man who is now coming toward the end

733
00:27:21.707 --> 00:27:24.118
and he is still holding onto the fear

734
00:27:24.118 --> 00:27:26.152
that he is going to Hell.

735
00:27:26.152 --> 00:27:30.272
Can you give us an idea of how you approach him?

736
00:27:30.272 --> 00:27:32.412
How you frame it, how you talk to him.

737
00:27:32.412 --> 00:27:34.972
<v ->Why does he think that?</v>

738
00:27:34.972 --> 00:27:36.892
<v Woman>And he'll say, usually?</v>

739
00:27:36.892 --> 00:27:39.373
<v ->I killed somebody in the war.</v>

740
00:27:39.373 --> 00:27:44.112
I shot a child, I became an alcoholic

741
00:27:44.112 --> 00:27:46.432
and alienated my family because nobody understood

742
00:27:46.432 --> 00:27:48.532
what I went through.

743
00:27:48.532 --> 00:27:51.372
PTSD, Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome

744
00:27:51.372 --> 00:27:53.352
is when you are scared to death.

745
00:27:53.352 --> 00:27:55.092
And it implants itself into psyche

746
00:27:55.092 --> 00:27:57.351
and the emotional structure of a human being

747
00:27:57.351 --> 00:27:59.332
regardless of what anybody tells you.

748
00:27:59.332 --> 00:28:01.372
It's part of the mechanisms of a human being

749
00:28:01.372 --> 00:28:02.692
to have a human existence.

750
00:28:02.692 --> 00:28:04.352
These things will happen.

751
00:28:04.352 --> 00:28:06.132
A chemical reaction in an emotional place

752
00:28:06.132 --> 00:28:07.572
will set up a trigger in the brain

753
00:28:07.572 --> 00:28:09.372
that when fear and intimate fear,

754
00:28:09.372 --> 00:28:11.352
that life and death threatening psychology

755
00:28:11.352 --> 00:28:12.832
begins to replay itself.

756
00:28:12.832 --> 00:28:14.971
Not because of the event that they're going through

757
00:28:14.971 --> 00:28:17.071
in transition from this world to the next,

758
00:28:17.071 --> 00:28:18.872
but the event that preceded it

759
00:28:18.872 --> 00:28:20.332
that puts itself into play.

760
00:28:20.332 --> 00:28:21.652
<v Woman>And so they keep playing this</v>

761
00:28:21.652 --> 00:28:22.952
over and over towards the end.

762
00:28:22.952 --> 00:28:24.312
<v ->Fighting the same war.</v>

763
00:28:24.312 --> 00:28:25.452
<v Woman>Fighting the same war.</v>

764
00:28:25.452 --> 00:28:28.411
Feeling the things that they felt at the time

765
00:28:28.411 --> 00:28:31.152
and regretting perhaps some of the things

766
00:28:31.152 --> 00:28:32.972
that they did or had to do.

767
00:28:32.972 --> 00:28:34.932
<v ->They're going to Hell for it.</v>

768
00:28:34.932 --> 00:28:36.032
The only thing they're regretting

769
00:28:36.032 --> 00:28:38.112
is the fact that they think they're going to Hell for it.

770
00:28:38.112 --> 00:28:38.952
<v Woman>Yeah.</v>

771
00:28:38.952 --> 00:28:40.132
<v ->When you're down, when you're looking</v>

772
00:28:40.132 --> 00:28:41.332
at those last breaths,

773
00:28:41.332 --> 00:28:42.492
you're in the dance.

774
00:28:42.492 --> 00:28:43.312
<v Woman>Yeah.</v>

775
00:28:43.312 --> 00:28:44.972
<v ->And that stuff better be settled. Well.</v>

776
00:28:44.972 --> 00:28:46.332
<v Woman>So what do you tell them?</v>

777
00:28:46.332 --> 00:28:47.831
<v ->I just watch them and listen to them.</v>

778
00:28:47.831 --> 00:28:49.352
And ask them why.

779
00:28:49.352 --> 00:28:51.542
Well could you have changed?

780
00:28:51.542 --> 00:28:52.598
How many of them are there?

781
00:28:52.598 --> 00:28:55.078
I've seen people fight Germans, Japanese, Vietnamese.

782
00:28:55.078 --> 00:28:56.898
Get out of the bed, throw things through the windows.

783
00:28:56.898 --> 00:28:58.398
You know, I've seen all of that.

784
00:28:58.398 --> 00:29:00.598
But I see little 25 year old women

785
00:29:00.598 --> 00:29:03.188
with three children and a husband with no legs

786
00:29:03.188 --> 00:29:06.553
and no arms and poly brain trauma.

787
00:29:06.553 --> 00:29:09.194
And the system is as bureaucratic and as stale

788
00:29:09.194 --> 00:29:11.894
as it was when it was no war.

789
00:29:11.894 --> 00:29:15.094
You know, it's archaic and dramatic increases

790
00:29:15.094 --> 00:29:17.594
in people moving to the system.

791
00:29:17.594 --> 00:29:19.574
It's like they did not anticipate the damage

792
00:29:19.574 --> 00:29:22.740
and they did not regulate, specificate, implement

793
00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:26.089
programs and funding mechanisms and support systems

794
00:29:26.089 --> 00:29:27.759
necessary to achieve the goal.

795
00:29:27.759 --> 00:29:29.340
So that means the military strategists

796
00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:33.660
whoever ran that should be fired or executed.

797
00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:34.682
<v Woman>It is failing.</v>

798
00:29:34.682 --> 00:29:36.722
So you're talking about women like this

799
00:29:36.722 --> 00:29:38.642
with children with a husband with no legs.

800
00:29:38.642 --> 00:29:40.462
<v ->That's a dead, that's a longer death.</v>

801
00:29:40.462 --> 00:29:41.862
Sometimes it's 20 years.

802
00:29:41.862 --> 00:29:43.982
<v Woman>So when this occurs,</v>

803
00:29:43.982 --> 00:29:46.682
are you able to help them breathe a different

804
00:29:46.682 --> 00:29:49.041
kind of breath when the time comes to pass over?

805
00:29:49.041 --> 00:29:49.973
<v ->Sure.</v>

806
00:29:49.973 --> 00:29:52.205
<v Woman>So that fear of going to Hell isn't there?</v>

807
00:29:52.205 --> 00:29:53.251
<v ->I'm great at it.</v>

808
00:29:53.251 --> 00:29:56.131
<v Woman>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

809
00:29:56.131 --> 00:29:57.777
<v ->I mean I've been doing it for 30 years.</v>

810
00:29:57.777 --> 00:29:59.057
<v Woman>I mean what a joy.</v>

811
00:29:59.057 --> 00:30:00.738
<v ->And I'm not afraid of death or any of that stuff.</v>

812
00:30:00.738 --> 00:30:02.937
And I can watch and I see some horrible deaths.

813
00:30:02.937 --> 00:30:04.357
But it's usually the family that's doing it,

814
00:30:04.357 --> 00:30:06.817
or that person, because if I get near them,

815
00:30:06.817 --> 00:30:08.377
or some of my people get near them,

816
00:30:08.377 --> 00:30:10.317
because we start weeks before.

817
00:30:10.317 --> 00:30:12.837
Sometimes months, sometimes years.

818
00:30:12.837 --> 00:30:14.597
So the continuity of on Thursday,

819
00:30:14.597 --> 00:30:17.017
Marsha's coming, Terry's coming,

820
00:30:17.017 --> 00:30:20.367
you know, Heidi's coming, Catherine's coming,

821
00:30:20.367 --> 00:30:22.933
Ben's coming, James is coming,

822
00:30:22.933 --> 00:30:25.373
then they create a rapport because the consistency

823
00:30:25.373 --> 00:30:27.253
of those people showing up.

824
00:30:27.253 --> 00:30:30.433
Or they show up when somebody who is dying with them

825
00:30:30.433 --> 00:30:32.393
or who loves them needs a break.

826
00:30:32.393 --> 00:30:34.593
You know, and they show up.

827
00:30:34.593 --> 00:30:37.373
Then they have a comfort zone in that.

828
00:30:37.373 --> 00:30:38.302
Okay, there's a comfort.

829
00:30:38.302 --> 00:30:39.522
And then when it's in those last days,

830
00:30:39.522 --> 00:30:41.683
there is nothing different about that person.

831
00:30:41.683 --> 00:30:43.341
They don't freak out, they ain't crying.

832
00:30:43.341 --> 00:30:45.641
They're not trying to steal your furniture.

833
00:30:45.641 --> 00:30:47.621
You know, we're not arguing over who gets what.

834
00:30:47.621 --> 00:30:48.621
Because you can't accept anything

835
00:30:48.621 --> 00:30:50.941
as the twilight begins, you sit there and you watch it

836
00:30:50.941 --> 00:30:55.221
like it's damn Ed Sullivan, okay, you know.

837
00:30:55.221 --> 00:30:56.302
And it's just like that.

838
00:30:56.302 --> 00:30:59.441
It's like Jackie Gleason in that.

839
00:30:59.441 --> 00:31:01.942
And then you just create closure.

840
00:31:01.942 --> 00:31:04.601
I would never not do this.

841
00:31:04.601 --> 00:31:07.582
And I recommend it to everybody, why?

842
00:31:07.582 --> 00:31:09.321
If you're 37 years old or older

843
00:31:09.321 --> 00:31:12.061
and you live in the United States of America

844
00:31:12.061 --> 00:31:13.041
and you have a family member

845
00:31:13.041 --> 00:31:15.101
anywhere in the world,

846
00:31:15.101 --> 00:31:16.421
you have an 81% chance

847
00:31:16.421 --> 00:31:17.961
that that family member will turn to you

848
00:31:17.961 --> 00:31:19.661
in the case of a catastrophic illness

849
00:31:19.661 --> 00:31:21.842
or a terminal disease before they turn to

850
00:31:21.842 --> 00:31:23.251
a doctor or clergy.

851
00:31:23.251 --> 00:31:24.202
<v Woman>True. Yeah.</v>

852
00:31:24.202 --> 00:31:24.959
<v ->If you're 37 years old,</v>

853
00:31:24.959 --> 00:31:27.196
and you have a friend anywhere in the world,

854
00:31:27.196 --> 00:31:29.536
you have a 60% chance that that friend will turn to you

855
00:31:29.536 --> 00:31:31.136
in the case of a catastrophic illness

856
00:31:31.136 --> 00:31:33.857
or terminal disease before they turn to a doctor or clergy.

857
00:31:33.857 --> 00:31:34.596
And believe it or not,

858
00:31:34.596 --> 00:31:36.777
you have a 100% chance, you will turn to you.

859
00:31:36.777 --> 00:31:38.436
<v Woman>Right, right.</v>

860
00:31:38.436 --> 00:31:40.437
<v ->And now when you've got an 81, 60, and 100% chance</v>

861
00:31:40.437 --> 00:31:42.416
of something occurring if you were in Las Vegas

862
00:31:42.416 --> 00:31:43.796
would you put the dollar in the machine?

863
00:31:43.796 --> 00:31:44.557
<v Woman>Yep.</v>

864
00:31:44.557 --> 00:31:45.636
<v ->Damn right.</v>

865
00:31:45.636 --> 00:31:46.876
Well I'm saying the same thing.

866
00:31:46.876 --> 00:31:48.076
Hey everybody.

867
00:31:48.076 --> 00:31:49.417
The faster you know about death,

868
00:31:49.417 --> 00:31:51.036
which is the ultimate life coach,

869
00:31:51.036 --> 00:31:52.596
the more you will know about life,

870
00:31:52.596 --> 00:31:55.417
and the greater the abundance of the opportunities

871
00:31:55.417 --> 00:31:56.757
that you can find.

872
00:31:56.757 --> 00:31:58.856
<v Woman>And you call that the greatest enlightenment</v>

873
00:31:58.856 --> 00:32:00.077
is that moment.

874
00:32:00.077 --> 00:32:01.776
<v ->Absolutely. Yeah.</v>

875
00:32:01.776 --> 00:32:03.056
I mean when that guy lets go,

876
00:32:03.056 --> 00:32:04.976
and I was holding his hand,

877
00:32:04.976 --> 00:32:06.057
I can feel myself,

878
00:32:06.057 --> 00:32:08.396
and this is the big secret of Dannion.

879
00:32:08.396 --> 00:32:10.116
Because I know the way down the tunnel

880
00:32:10.116 --> 00:32:11.176
and I know the mindset,

881
00:32:11.176 --> 00:32:13.547
I can go part of the way down the tunnel.

882
00:32:13.547 --> 00:32:15.016
And I'm not going to be a hero.

883
00:32:15.016 --> 00:32:17.515
You know, this is about people of us,

884
00:32:17.515 --> 00:32:18.763
are just like me, I'm no different

885
00:32:18.763 --> 00:32:20.963
than anybody else I've just been dead.

886
00:32:20.963 --> 00:32:22.783
But all it did was change my perspective,

887
00:32:22.783 --> 00:32:23.924
it didn't do anything else

888
00:32:23.924 --> 00:32:26.124
and enhanced my empathetic ability

889
00:32:26.124 --> 00:32:28.773
to perceive conscious thought patterns.

890
00:32:28.773 --> 00:32:29.793
Which is why they call it psychic.

891
00:32:29.793 --> 00:32:33.153
But mine is, I understand how it works.

892
00:32:33.153 --> 00:32:36.633
Remember, one day I never believed any of this.

893
00:32:36.633 --> 00:32:38.493
The next day I was dead,

894
00:32:38.493 --> 00:32:40.152
and the day after that I became everything

895
00:32:40.152 --> 00:32:42.292
I never believed.

896
00:32:42.292 --> 00:32:46.232
And I didn't know what an NDE was.

897
00:32:46.232 --> 00:32:48.353
I had no earthly idea what had happened to me

898
00:32:48.353 --> 00:32:50.453
but it was the single most real event

899
00:32:50.453 --> 00:32:52.480
that has ever occurred to me.

900
00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.680
And I had no preparation for it, it just came.

901
00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.357
The next two, the open heart surgery

902
00:32:57.357 --> 00:32:58.537
and the brain surgery,

903
00:32:58.537 --> 00:33:00.597
I had time to think about that.

904
00:33:00.597 --> 00:33:02.777
The second one was just exactly like the first one

905
00:33:02.777 --> 00:33:05.087
in its structure and the feelings.

906
00:33:05.087 --> 00:33:06.613
The third was a little different.

907
00:33:06.613 --> 00:33:10.953
Because I lingered longer in a place within the journey,

908
00:33:10.953 --> 00:33:12.933
which is what I call the blue-gray place,

909
00:33:12.933 --> 00:33:14.933
then I did because then I got down to the tunnel,

910
00:33:14.933 --> 00:33:16.172
to the end of the tunnel,

911
00:33:16.172 --> 00:33:17.633
didn't see it being a light,

912
00:33:17.633 --> 00:33:19.353
but I could see the life review which I knew

913
00:33:19.353 --> 00:33:20.349
was the next pattern.

914
00:33:20.349 --> 00:33:22.808
Now I don't know if I knew that consciously,

915
00:33:22.808 --> 00:33:25.889
or I knew that because I had been through this before.

916
00:33:25.889 --> 00:33:27.469
And then I started back.

917
00:33:27.469 --> 00:33:29.329
It was not to see a third near death experience,

918
00:33:29.329 --> 00:33:31.089
third panoramic life review.

919
00:33:31.089 --> 00:33:33.149
I could see it beginning to happen

920
00:33:33.149 --> 00:33:35.908
when I was not intricately woven within it and so.

921
00:33:35.908 --> 00:33:37.129
<v Woman>So you can go with these people</v>

922
00:33:37.129 --> 00:33:38.449
because you know the way?

923
00:33:38.449 --> 00:33:39.469
<v ->Yeah.</v>

924
00:33:39.469 --> 00:33:40.969
<v Woman>So you go with them part of the way.</v>

925
00:33:40.969 --> 00:33:45.669
What happens then? When you're holding their hand?

926
00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:47.329
<v ->Well they let go.</v>

927
00:33:47.329 --> 00:33:49.489
And I know exactly how to pace the breath,

928
00:33:49.489 --> 00:33:51.869
what to think, how to set my intent.

929
00:33:51.869 --> 00:33:53.888
And I wait, and I know when they lift out,

930
00:33:53.888 --> 00:33:56.049
or I see someone come to get them.

931
00:33:56.049 --> 00:33:57.889
Now this is what the thrill is.

932
00:33:57.889 --> 00:33:59.189
And I can cross into that world now.

933
00:33:59.189 --> 00:34:00.889
I can create an atmosphere

934
00:34:00.889 --> 00:34:03.269
that that world can cross into mine.

935
00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:04.988
And by creating that crossover place

936
00:34:04.988 --> 00:34:07.469
that's not just one point, that last breath,

937
00:34:07.469 --> 00:34:09.869
it's those days, hours, and minutes

938
00:34:09.869 --> 00:34:11.909
that come to value and specifically

939
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:13.489
that allows that world to come here

940
00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:15.449
and us to go into that world.

941
00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:18.788
You know, when the Bible says,

942
00:34:18.788 --> 00:34:20.234
where two or more gather in my name,

943
00:34:20.234 --> 00:34:21.578
so shall I be among you.

944
00:34:21.578 --> 00:34:23.618
But there's only one place that can happen.

945
00:34:23.618 --> 00:34:25.718
And it ain't church, it's at the bedside.

946
00:34:25.718 --> 00:34:27.858
It's you, that person going, and God.

947
00:34:27.858 --> 00:34:29.686
And maybe this trigger is not true,

948
00:34:29.686 --> 00:34:31.186
well, that's how I know it's true.

949
00:34:31.186 --> 00:34:33.736
I do the work.

950
00:34:35.706 --> 00:34:37.386
<v ->If you feel drawn to join Dannion</v>

951

952
00:34:40.366 --> 00:34:41.966

to help you to become involved.

954
00:34:43.526 --> 00:34:45.146
Meanwhile, another of our interviews

955
00:34:45.146 --> 00:34:47.366
that helps us understand the transition to death

956
00:34:47.366 --> 00:34:49.326
is with Fern Stewart Welch,

957
00:34:49.326 --> 00:34:51.126
I think you might enjoy that one as well.

958
00:34:51.126 --> 00:34:53.556
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
