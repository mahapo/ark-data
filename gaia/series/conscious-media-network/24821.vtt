00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.602
<v ->Kiva offers an answer to the often</v>

2
00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:04.777
frustrating question of how one person

3
00:00:04.777 --> 00:00:06.645
can make a difference in the world.

4
00:00:06.645 --> 00:00:09.609
Kiva is a San Francisco based organization

5
00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:11.178
who puts people in touch with those

6
00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:13.139
in developing nations who need

7
00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.706
a helping hand to start,

8
00:00:14.706 --> 00:00:16.904
save, or expand their business.

9
00:00:16.904 --> 00:00:18.813
In many cases, a sum as little as

10
00:00:18.813 --> 00:00:21.639
$100 is the difference between a thriving

11
00:00:21.639 --> 00:00:23.377
business, allowing someone to care

12
00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:24.477
for their family,

13
00:00:24.477 --> 00:00:26.264
and becoming a beggar on the street.

14
00:00:26.264 --> 00:00:31.264
(music)

15
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:36.710
<v Voiceover>This is a wonderfully,</v>

16
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.011
energizing enviornment.

17
00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:41.116
You have a really, kind of mulit-ethnic group here,

18
00:00:41.116 --> 00:00:42.843
multi-lingual, which of course would be

19
00:00:42.843 --> 00:00:44.508
necessary for the kind of work you do.

20
00:00:44.508 --> 00:00:46.481
And, well you've got a lot of trainees,

21
00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:47.717
so there's a lot of noise.

22
00:00:47.717 --> 00:00:48.858
People coming and going.

23
00:00:48.858 --> 00:00:51.937
It's a really nice, warm, kind of exciting

24
00:00:51.937 --> 00:00:53.357
vibe going on here.

25
00:00:53.357 --> 00:00:54.881
<v ->It's fun to be a part of.</v>

26
00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:56.994
And, Kiva is really about a community,

27
00:00:56.994 --> 00:00:58.497
so it's people coming together

28
00:00:58.497 --> 00:00:59.553
at the Kiva headquarters.

29
00:00:59.553 --> 00:01:01.024
It's Kiva fellows who are in the office this week

30
00:01:01.024 --> 00:01:02.983
for training that are gonna go

31
00:01:02.983 --> 00:01:05.366
and work with our partners around the world.

32
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.547
So, it's really about building this

33
00:01:06.547 --> 00:01:07.826
community of people all around the world.

34
00:01:07.826 --> 00:01:09.267
And, that's really reflected in the office.

35
00:01:09.267 --> 00:01:09.861
<v Voiceover>It feels like that.</v>

36
00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:12.890
Everybody is eating pizza downstairs together.

37
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.479
Let's talk about Kiva a little bit.

38
00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.951
For people who don't understand micro,

39
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:19.043
the microloan industry,

40
00:01:19.043 --> 00:01:21.240
how this was given birth to,

41
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.469
and what it is your overall mission is,

42
00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:25.239
and then, we'll start getting into some specifics

43
00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:26.198
after that.

44
00:01:26.198 --> 00:01:26.881
<v ->Sure.</v>

45
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:28.649
Well, microfinance is the provision

46
00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.815
of financial services to the poor.

47
00:01:30.815 --> 00:01:32.692
You know, a lot of people really

48
00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:34.004
know about Muhammad Yunus

49
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:35.081
who won the Nobel Peace Prize

50
00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:37.822
in 2006 for his work with the Grameem Bank.

51
00:01:37.822 --> 00:01:40.286
And, it's really about the idea of helping

52
00:01:40.286 --> 00:01:41.300
the poor help themselves

53
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.483
through financial services.

54
00:01:42.483 --> 00:01:44.169
So, the idea of if you gave somebody

55
00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:45.727
the money to buy a fishing net,

56
00:01:45.727 --> 00:01:48.488
they could then fish and support themselves,

57
00:01:48.488 --> 00:01:49.652
rather than needing, you know,

58
00:01:49.652 --> 00:01:51.667
charity or donations.

59
00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:54.408
So, Kiva was really the idea of how can we

60
00:01:54.408 --> 00:01:57.469
allow everyday people to be

61
00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:58.546
those microlenders.

62
00:01:58.546 --> 00:02:01.546
How could I, you know, sitting in San Francisco,

63
00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.216
make a loan to somebody

64
00:02:03.216 --> 00:02:04.688
on the other side of the world

65
00:02:04.688 --> 00:02:06.064
so that they could then support themselves.

66
00:02:06.064 --> 00:02:07.995
And, that's really how the idea came about

67
00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:10.938
was allow individuals like you or I

68
00:02:10.938 --> 00:02:12.752
to really participate in microfinance

69
00:02:12.752 --> 00:02:13.972
as a microlender.

70
00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:15.652
<v Voiceover>And, you have,</v>

71
00:02:15.652 --> 00:02:16.922
I mean, people can participate

72
00:02:16.922 --> 00:02:18.032
at pretty much any level,

73
00:02:18.032 --> 00:02:19.599
if they choose to get involved, right?

74
00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:20.026
<v ->Yeah.</v>

75
00:02:20.026 --> 00:02:20.996
<v Voiceover>So, anyone listening,</v>

76
00:02:20.996 --> 00:02:22.788
if you have $50 or $100,

77
00:02:22.788 --> 00:02:24.580
you could make a microloan?

78
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.285
<v ->Exactly.</v>

79
00:02:25.285 --> 00:02:26.787
It's all about being really inclusive.

80
00:02:26.787 --> 00:02:28.867
So, we wanted to make it at a price point

81
00:02:28.867 --> 00:02:30.830
that anybody could really participate in.

82
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.462
And if you think about what it costs

83
00:02:32.462 --> 00:02:34.339
to start a business in the developing world,

84
00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:35.330
you can start a business actually

85
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.463
with $100 that somebody could then grow

86
00:02:37.463 --> 00:02:39.692
and develop, and then support their family with.

87
00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:41.320
So, we've actually broken it down to,

88
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.979
you can be a contributor, from just $25.

89
00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:46.380
And, that was a really important number for us

90
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.659
because we feel like pretty much

91
00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.921
anybody could lend $25,

92
00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:52.895
and you know, it wouldn't really

93
00:02:52.895 --> 00:02:54.805
too much affect them.

94
00:02:54.805 --> 00:02:56.265
And, then of course when the loan

95
00:02:56.265 --> 00:02:57.746
gets paid back, they get their money back.

96
00:02:57.746 --> 00:02:59.612
<v Voiceover>That's really a lovely spin</v>

97
00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:01.660
on the world globalization.

98
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.444
It turns it into a real brotherhood

99
00:03:04.444 --> 00:03:05.286
of humanity.

100
00:03:05.286 --> 00:03:06.822
Sisterhood of humanity.

101
00:03:06.822 --> 00:03:09.307
Really, people helping people very directly.

102
00:03:09.307 --> 00:03:11.035
And, let's talk about the program itself,

103
00:03:11.035 --> 00:03:12.187
because my understanding is

104
00:03:12.187 --> 00:03:16.048
you can choose who you want to

105
00:03:16.048 --> 00:03:18.096
back if there's a certain individual

106
00:03:18.096 --> 00:03:19.643
or company or enterprise you want

107
00:03:19.643 --> 00:03:21.436
to get involved with, you can do that.

108
00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:23.835
A lot of the businesses are women owned.

109
00:03:23.835 --> 00:03:26.107
So, tell us a little bit about

110
00:03:26.107 --> 00:03:27.268
some of the people you're

111
00:03:27.268 --> 00:03:28.100
loaning money to.

112
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.949
Some of your favorite stories.

113
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.248
<v ->You know, I just got some footage back from Sierra Leone,</v>

114
00:03:32.248 --> 00:03:35.068
which really really touched me, I can tell you.

115
00:03:35.068 --> 00:03:37.049
When I was watching the playback I was just amazed.

116
00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.028
There's been a lot of violence in Sierra Leone,

117
00:03:40.028 --> 00:03:42.508
and I saw a story about a man named Yenku

118
00:03:42.508 --> 00:03:46.288
who was in his early 20's when he had

119
00:03:46.288 --> 00:03:47.748
both of his hands cut off.

120
00:03:47.748 --> 00:03:51.149
Now, in the developed world there might be places

121
00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:54.708
where you could actually access some kind of disability,

122
00:03:54.708 --> 00:03:57.488
or somebody could help you, but in Sierra Leone

123
00:03:57.488 --> 00:03:59.089
he was left in the streets to beg.

124
00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:01.906
He was approached by a microfinance institution

125
00:04:01.906 --> 00:04:04.866
in Freetown and they saw that he had

126
00:04:04.866 --> 00:04:06.606
a real desire to be self sufficient.

127
00:04:06.606 --> 00:04:08.186
He really wanted to work hard.

128
00:04:08.186 --> 00:04:10.546
He didn't want to be relying on other people's charity,

129
00:04:10.546 --> 00:04:13.866
and they loaned him, it was just $100

130
00:04:13.866 --> 00:04:17.785
and he got some, originally he was selling soaps

131
00:04:17.785 --> 00:04:20.865
and just little sundries, little knickknacks he could sell.

132
00:04:20.865 --> 00:04:24.045
And he's built that up over two years.

133
00:04:24.045 --> 00:04:26.046
He now supports a family of three,

134
00:04:26.046 --> 00:04:27.965
and he actually pays for his younger brother

135
00:04:27.965 --> 00:04:28.966
to go to school.

136
00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:30.705
So when I was watching this story,

137
00:04:30.705 --> 00:04:32.726
obviously it's really touching

138
00:04:32.726 --> 00:04:34.966
to hear a story like that, but particularly

139
00:04:34.966 --> 00:04:37.705
to see this young man that had it not

140
00:04:37.705 --> 00:04:39.806
been for this loan, he would have been a beggar.

141
00:04:39.806 --> 00:04:41.865
And now he actually is a provider.

142
00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:44.026
He's not just a survivor, he's a provider now.

143
00:04:44.856 --> 00:04:47.985
[Voiceover] It's really an amazing chasm

144
00:04:47.985 --> 00:04:51.716
in what we call value, here where a person

145
00:04:51.716 --> 00:04:54.455
will drop that $100 on a pair of shoes

146
00:04:54.455 --> 00:04:59.096
and have, maybe, 20 more pair like it in the closet.

147
00:04:59.096 --> 00:05:02.875
To think of the true value of what money,

148
00:05:02.875 --> 00:05:05.135
of what finance can do in the world.

149
00:05:05.135 --> 00:05:06.756
I mean this, that really exemplifies it.

150
00:05:06.756 --> 00:05:10.176
Give me an idea of some of the other projects,

151
00:05:10.176 --> 00:05:14.236
and people and countries that you're working with right now.

152
00:05:14.236 --> 00:05:16.216
<v ->Well, we're currently working with</v>

153
00:05:16.216 --> 00:05:18.456
89 microfinance institutions

154
00:05:18.456 --> 00:05:19.793
and they're all very different.

155
00:05:19.793 --> 00:05:21.746
Every microfinance institution

156
00:05:21.746 --> 00:05:24.168
targets a different population

157
00:05:24.168 --> 00:05:25.588
and they're in different regions.

158
00:05:25.588 --> 00:05:26.907
The lending climate is very different.

159
00:05:26.907 --> 00:05:28.268
So sometimes there are lending groups.

160
00:05:28.268 --> 00:05:29.728
Sometimes it's individuals.

161
00:05:29.728 --> 00:05:31.348
Sometimes it's focusing on women

162
00:05:31.348 --> 00:05:32.807
It depends on where they are,

163
00:05:32.807 --> 00:05:34.767
and we're actually in 42 countries right now.

164
00:05:34.767 --> 00:05:37.528
Another one of my favorite stories is a

165
00:05:37.528 --> 00:05:40.468
young man by the name of Angel, and he lives in Bulgaria.

166
00:05:40.468 --> 00:05:42.987
and he's actually part of the Roman minority,

167
00:05:42.987 --> 00:05:44.627
commonly known as gypsies.

168
00:05:44.627 --> 00:05:45.308
[Voiceover] Yes

169
00:05:45.308 --> 00:05:46.808
<v ->And this story really touched me</v>

170
00:05:46.808 --> 00:05:50.448
because he tried so hard to get a loan for himself.

171
00:05:50.448 --> 00:05:51.608
He actually went to six banks

172
00:05:51.608 --> 00:05:53.607
in the city that he's from, in Sliven.

173
00:05:53.607 --> 00:05:55.707
And at every bank he was turned away.

174
00:05:55.707 --> 00:05:58.808
They found he was turned away just because of his ethnicity.

175
00:05:58.808 --> 00:05:59.747
[Voiceover] Yes

176
00:05:59.747 --> 00:06:01.208
<v ->So you get such different stories.</v>

177
00:06:01.208 --> 00:06:02.148
You know, sometimes people are

178
00:06:02.148 --> 00:06:03.083
turned away because of their gender.

179
00:06:03.083 --> 00:06:04.543
Sometimes it's just because they're poor.

180
00:06:04.543 --> 00:06:06.783
You know, they just can't, they don't

181
00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:07.802
have any collateral for a loan.

182
00:06:07.802 --> 00:06:09.122
Sometimes they're illiterate.

183
00:06:09.122 --> 00:06:10.783
Sometimes it's their ethnicity.

184
00:06:10.783 --> 00:06:11.763
Sometimes they're disabled.

185
00:06:11.763 --> 00:06:13.563
So there are such different reasons

186
00:06:13.563 --> 00:06:15.943
why people are excluded from the financial sector.

187
00:06:15.943 --> 00:06:18.562
But every time you hear those individual stories,

188
00:06:18.562 --> 00:06:20.642
it just really brings it home, and that's why

189
00:06:20.642 --> 00:06:23.002
the stories are so important on our website.

190
00:06:23.002 --> 00:06:25.260
Because that's really what helps people understand-

191
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.510
[Voiceover] Yes

192
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.030
like you said you could spend $100

193
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.249
on a pair of shoes, or you could read this story

194
00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:31.789
about a person that actually built

195
00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:33.489
a sustainable business and is supporting

196
00:06:33.489 --> 00:06:34.610
his family from $100.

197
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.149
So that's why we really focus on the stories.

198
00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:38.410
[Voiceover] Yes, I mean that's

199
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.850
such a disconnect for most people

200
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.190
in the developed world.

201
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:41.990
<v ->Right</v>

202
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.410
[Voiceover] That this can happen.

203
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.370
What about, do you do loans into

204
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.130
any of the developed nations or is this

205
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.389
all third world nations that are being loaned to?

206
00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:54.230
<v ->Right now, we're just working in the developing world.</v>

207
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.989
Obviously, Kiva was started with the mission to alleviate

208
00:06:57.989 --> 00:07:00.250
poverty, and of course there's poverty all around the world.

209
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.310
But we started off in eastern Africa,

210
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.470
and we are endeavoring to spread

211
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.269
to many countries in the developing world.

212
00:07:07.269 --> 00:07:08.470
And that's really where there's

213
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.830
a desire on the part of our lenders to lend right now.

214
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.710
But we are keeping options open.

215
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.749
One day it would be exciting to have somebody

216
00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:17.529
lending to someone in the United States.

217
00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:19.358
Or what if you had somebody in Brazil

218
00:07:19.358 --> 00:07:20.837
lending to someone in the united States.

219
00:07:20.837 --> 00:07:22.578
It's all about, kind of, changing

220
00:07:22.578 --> 00:07:24.298
the way we think about the poor.

221
00:07:24.298 --> 00:07:25.297
[Voiceover] Yes

222
00:07:25.297 --> 00:07:26.758
<v ->And changing the way we think</v>

223
00:07:26.758 --> 00:07:28.838
about poverty and helping others.

224
00:07:28.838 --> 00:07:30.777
Because there's poverty everywhere

225
00:07:30.777 --> 00:07:32.297
and I think that sometimes when

226
00:07:32.297 --> 00:07:34.398
we attach this word, the poor,

227
00:07:34.398 --> 00:07:37.238
this label to a certain group of people

228
00:07:37.238 --> 00:07:39.818
there's so much baggage that comes along with that.

229
00:07:39.818 --> 00:07:41.938
And what Kiva is really about is breaking it down

230
00:07:41.938 --> 00:07:44.958
to personal stories that you or I can understand.

231
00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.677
You know, most people have needed

232
00:07:46.677 --> 00:07:49.398
a loan at some point in life, they've needed a hand up.

233
00:07:49.398 --> 00:07:51.618
So when you really break it down into those stories

234
00:07:51.618 --> 00:07:53.818
it's something that's really accessible

235
00:07:53.818 --> 00:07:55.657
for everyday people that would

236
00:07:55.657 --> 00:07:58.198
spend their $100 on a pair of shoes.

237
00:07:58.198 --> 00:07:59.718
Now they can really understand

238
00:07:59.718 --> 00:08:02.738
Wow, this person is so much like me in so many ways.

239
00:08:02.738 --> 00:08:06.138
I could just lend him $25 and he could

240
00:08:06.138 --> 00:08:08.467
have a better chance at life.

241
00:08:08.467 --> 00:08:10.608
[Voiceover] Absolutely, so based on compassion too.

242
00:08:10.608 --> 00:08:12.904
Compassion for our fellow human being.

243
00:08:12.904 --> 00:08:15.245
<v ->Yeah, I think when you bring it into</v>

244
00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:17.945
really personal terms and you really break it down

245
00:08:17.945 --> 00:08:20.445
into actual needs and actual loans.

246
00:08:20.445 --> 00:08:23.504
You know, often we talk about this problem

247
00:08:23.504 --> 00:08:25.124
of global poverty and it becomes

248
00:08:25.124 --> 00:08:26.875
so immense and massive -

249
00:08:26.875 --> 00:08:27.865
[Voiceover] You feel like you can't do anything.

250
00:08:27.865 --> 00:08:30.396
<v ->You can't do anything and, you know,</v>

251
00:08:30.396 --> 00:08:32.376
when our co-founders were in Africa

252
00:08:32.376 --> 00:08:34.296
they actually saw those individual stories.

253
00:08:34.296 --> 00:08:36.857
They realized that you can make a difference

254
00:08:36.857 --> 00:08:39.137
with a small amount of money and they wanted to

255
00:08:39.137 --> 00:08:41.417
share that with people all around the world.

256
00:08:41.417 --> 00:08:43.117
That you can actually make a difference.

257
00:08:43.117 --> 00:08:46.017
So that was really the design there.

258
00:08:46.017 --> 00:08:48.116
To facilitate this connection so that

259
00:08:48.116 --> 00:08:49.536
everyday people can make a difference.

260
00:08:49.536 --> 00:08:52.417
[Voiceover] With what's going on right now,

261
00:08:52.417 --> 00:08:54.456
and of course people will be viewing

262
00:08:54.456 --> 00:08:56.157
this interview at different points in time,

263
00:08:56.157 --> 00:08:57.736
but right now we're in the beginning

264
00:08:57.736 --> 00:09:00.016
of the U.S.'s financial meltdown.

265
00:09:00.016 --> 00:09:02.857
They call it the great financial crisis,

266
00:09:02.857 --> 00:09:05.696
and, you know, again we're talking about

267
00:09:05.696 --> 00:09:08.596
lending institutions in large part and the like,

268
00:09:08.596 --> 00:09:11.257
and here you have this which almost seems

269
00:09:11.257 --> 00:09:13.497
to be an island unto itself.

270
00:09:13.497 --> 00:09:16.756
Is this actually for people that are starting

271
00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:20.656
to become nervous about traditional institutions

272
00:09:20.656 --> 00:09:22.136
they have money with and such.

273
00:09:22.136 --> 00:09:26.317
Is this an option to go this direction

274
00:09:26.317 --> 00:09:29.817
or is it such a different breed?

275
00:09:29.817 --> 00:09:32.357
<v ->It's a different breed, you know,</v>

276
00:09:32.357 --> 00:09:34.256
microfinance is very specific

277
00:09:34.256 --> 00:09:36.709
towards serving people that

278
00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:39.769
can't access financial services any other way.

279
00:09:39.769 --> 00:09:41.429
And it's interesting that you bring that up

280
00:09:41.429 --> 00:09:43.609
because now people that typically

281
00:09:43.609 --> 00:09:46.348
have had so much access to financial services,

282
00:09:46.348 --> 00:09:49.609
and particularly debt, they're really understanding

283
00:09:49.609 --> 00:09:52.649
what it's like for so many people around the world

284
00:09:52.649 --> 00:09:54.369
that don't have that.

285
00:09:54.369 --> 00:09:55.769
[Voiceover] So true

286
00:09:55.769 --> 00:09:57.809
<v ->We're so used to getting credit card applications</v>

287
00:09:57.809 --> 00:09:59.929
in the mail, if we ever needed to borrow money

288
00:09:59.929 --> 00:10:02.128
there would be ten people who would

289
00:10:02.128 --> 00:10:03.668
offer to lend us that money.

290
00:10:03.668 --> 00:10:05.889
So it's been very interesting for us

291
00:10:05.889 --> 00:10:08.649
and, you know, I think in this environment

292
00:10:08.649 --> 00:10:10.328
a lot of non-profit have been having

293
00:10:10.328 --> 00:10:12.269
a very difficult time, but what we've been seeing

294
00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:15.489
is people really understand microfinance now,

295
00:10:15.489 --> 00:10:17.789
because in the past it might have been something

296
00:10:17.789 --> 00:10:18.949
that didn't make much sense.

297
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:22.688
Why would a poor person need a loan or a savings account?

298
00:10:22.688 --> 00:10:25.968
But now when people experience not having access to that

299
00:10:25.968 --> 00:10:27.969
they can really understand all

300
00:10:27.969 --> 00:10:30.168
the opportunities that it gives you.

301
00:10:30.168 --> 00:10:32.289
I mean we hear a lot about students

302
00:10:32.289 --> 00:10:35.689
not having access to debt to go to school.

303
00:10:35.689 --> 00:10:38.569
And so when that situation comes around

304
00:10:38.569 --> 00:10:40.148
you can really imagine what it's like

305
00:10:40.148 --> 00:10:41.928
for people that will just never have any chance

306
00:10:41.928 --> 00:10:43.849
for having enough money to go to school.

307
00:10:43.849 --> 00:10:44.949
And it's such a basic thing,

308
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:46.769
that we have to consider a right.

309
00:10:46.769 --> 00:10:49.508
[Voiceover] Talk a little bit about

310
00:10:49.508 --> 00:10:50.929
some of the women's projects.

311
00:10:50.929 --> 00:10:54.309
<v ->We have a lot of women's projects all around the world.</v>

312
00:10:54.309 --> 00:10:57.929
I think one of my favorite projects is in Afghanistan.

313
00:10:57.929 --> 00:11:01.728
It's an organization that is, was started by

314
00:11:01.728 --> 00:11:04.288
a wonderful woman called Stry, who was actually

315
00:11:04.288 --> 00:11:07.848
studying medicine before the Taliban came into Afghanistan,

316
00:11:07.848 --> 00:11:09.589
and of course she couldn't study anymore.

317
00:11:09.589 --> 00:11:13.252
And she's actually said that she finds now,

318
00:11:13.252 --> 00:11:15.592
it more fulfilling for her working for

319
00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:17.031
this microfinance institution,

320
00:11:17.031 --> 00:11:19.311
because as a doctor you treat one person,

321
00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:22.411
but a microfinance institution helps

322
00:11:22.411 --> 00:11:24.238
one person who then helps their family.

323
00:11:24.238 --> 00:11:26.298
So you can actually reach more people.

324
00:11:26.298 --> 00:11:28.538
And this organization, of course, targets women

325
00:11:28.538 --> 00:11:30.728
and in Afghanistan they don't have

326
00:11:30.728 --> 00:11:32.768
much access to financial services,

327
00:11:32.768 --> 00:11:36.388
and being run by a woman, an Afghan woman, as well

328
00:11:36.388 --> 00:11:38.508
is obviously a very powerful statement.

329
00:11:38.508 --> 00:11:40.528
And then to have that organization

330
00:11:40.528 --> 00:11:43.628
being supported by women all around the world.

331
00:11:43.628 --> 00:11:46.388
And that's something we very often see on Kiva.

332
00:11:46.388 --> 00:11:48.628
Kiva's all about communities and global communities,

333
00:11:48.628 --> 00:11:49.848
but we often see these smaller

334
00:11:49.848 --> 00:11:51.968
communities gathering together, and groups of women

335
00:11:51.968 --> 00:11:54.488
that will then support women on the website.

336
00:11:54.488 --> 00:11:56.588
And seeing those connections happening

337
00:11:56.588 --> 00:11:58.328
are, you know, really fun.

338
00:11:58.328 --> 00:12:03.328
And it really just reflects, kind of,

339
00:12:03.548 --> 00:12:05.928
this desire that people have to connect with each other

340
00:12:05.928 --> 00:12:07.588
and people want to help one another.

341
00:12:07.588 --> 00:12:09.428
They just want to be able to do it in a way

342
00:12:09.428 --> 00:12:12.008
that really shows those transactions that are happening.

343
00:12:12.008 --> 00:12:13.268
[Voiceover] Yes, and you're making it easy.

344
00:12:13.268 --> 00:12:15.388
Now, how does a person, such as Angel you were talking about

345
00:12:15.388 --> 00:12:18.388
or this woman in Afghanistan, how do they

346
00:12:18.388 --> 00:12:23.388
end up in touch with Kiva and a potential lender?

347
00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:28.648
<v ->So Kiva works with the microfinance institutions.</v>

348
00:12:28.648 --> 00:12:30.048
We have a partnership with them.

349
00:12:30.048 --> 00:12:33.288
So we're trying to find those really high quality

350
00:12:33.288 --> 00:12:35.468
institutions that have a strong social mission.

351
00:12:35.468 --> 00:12:36.908
[Voiceover] In each of the countries, you mean?

352
00:12:36.908 --> 00:12:38.148
<v ->Yes in each of the countries, exactly.</v>

353
00:12:38.148 --> 00:12:41.768
and then those organizations then access the clients.

354
00:12:41.768 --> 00:12:44.448
It depends on the region, sometimes

355
00:12:44.448 --> 00:12:46.728
the clients are looking for them, sometimes

356
00:12:46.728 --> 00:12:48.408
they reach out and find the clients.

357
00:12:48.408 --> 00:12:50.208
Perhaps there's a region where,

358
00:12:50.208 --> 00:12:51.948
you know, a bank has failed in the past

359
00:12:51.948 --> 00:12:54.868
and the clients are afraid to access debt.

360
00:12:54.868 --> 00:12:57.488
So they're, depending on the lending environment

361
00:12:57.488 --> 00:13:00.808
they might advertise, people might come to them

362
00:13:00.808 --> 00:13:03.308
and then they'll have an application process

363
00:13:03.308 --> 00:13:05.628
that they go through with each one.

364
00:13:05.628 --> 00:13:08.288
Once they get approved by the microfinance institution,

365
00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:11.147
then they're uploaded to the Kiva website.

366
00:13:11.147 --> 00:13:12.727
Kind of, if you think about it, if you were

367
00:13:12.727 --> 00:13:14.187
selling something on Ebay you would upload

368
00:13:14.187 --> 00:13:15.547
the information and you'd take a picture

369
00:13:15.547 --> 00:13:18.007
and you'd upload that. It's just the same as that.

370
00:13:18.007 --> 00:13:20.167
So it's a simple, you know, online process

371
00:13:20.167 --> 00:13:22.007
but then when you come to the website

372
00:13:22.007 --> 00:13:24.147
you'll see the list of people that

373
00:13:24.147 --> 00:13:26.187
have been needing a loan right now.

374
00:13:26.187 --> 00:13:27.707
[Voiceover] And actually it's made,

375
00:13:27.707 --> 00:13:30.187
it seems to me it's made quite easy from what I've seen

376
00:13:30.187 --> 00:13:31.887
and that you use PayPal for example.

377
00:13:31.887 --> 00:13:33.167
<v ->Exactly</v>

378
00:13:33.167 --> 00:13:34.867
[Voiceover] Transfer the money around rather easily.

379
00:13:34.867 --> 00:13:37.347
<v ->Exactly and one really exciting thing</v>

380
00:13:37.347 --> 00:13:39.447
as we build Kiva, we see so many people

381
00:13:39.447 --> 00:13:41.207
coming and wanting to help, and PayPal

382
00:13:41.207 --> 00:13:43.707
has actually waived all the transaction fees.

383
00:13:43.707 --> 00:13:44.907
<v ->You know, obviously--</v>

384
00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:46.447
[Voiceover] I'm glad to hear that.

385
00:13:46.447 --> 00:13:47.547
<v ->It's a great thing for the business</v>

386
00:13:47.547 --> 00:13:48.887
but it's also wonderful to see

387
00:13:48.887 --> 00:13:50.808
a corporation really excited that

388
00:13:50.808 --> 00:13:52.527
you can use our technology to do

389
00:13:52.527 --> 00:13:54.767
something really good and want to contribute in that way.

390
00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:56.767
[Voiceover] Very nice, I'm glad to hear that.

391
00:13:56.767 --> 00:13:59.407
Well, I mean, you've been getting some press, by the way.

392
00:13:59.407 --> 00:14:00.247
<v ->We have.</v>

393
00:14:00.247 --> 00:14:01.607
[Voiceover] Lets talk about some of that,

394
00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:03.447
what's been happening and how you attracted,

395
00:14:03.447 --> 00:14:04.647
what, President Clinton?

396
00:14:04.647 --> 00:14:05.587
<v ->Yes</v>

397
00:14:05.587 --> 00:14:06.847
[Voiceover] Oprah?

398
00:14:06.847 --> 00:14:07.827
<v ->Yes.</v>

399
00:14:07.827 --> 00:14:09.707
We were actually included in President Clinton's

400
00:14:09.707 --> 00:14:11.807
book, Giving, which came out in 2007.

401
00:14:11.807 --> 00:14:14.687
And they selected a couple of the projects,

402
00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.127
that are highlighted in the book,

403
00:14:16.127 --> 00:14:18.687
to join him on the Oprah show,

404
00:14:18.687 --> 00:14:21.847
which was, of course, incredibly exciting,

405
00:14:21.847 --> 00:14:24.747
very overwhelming and ah I would say

406
00:14:24.747 --> 00:14:26.927
probably a little bit intimidating to be there.

407
00:14:26.927 --> 00:14:29.167
It's not only meeting President Clinton,

408
00:14:29.167 --> 00:14:31.887
but also meeting Oprah, in the same day, in the same moment.

409
00:14:31.887 --> 00:14:32.927
[Voiceover] Did you do that?

410
00:14:32.927 --> 00:14:34.947
<v ->I was at the show.</v>

411
00:14:34.947 --> 00:14:35.787
[Voiceover] You were?

412
00:14:35.787 --> 00:14:37.467
<v ->And Matt and Jessica were in the audience,</v>

413
00:14:37.467 --> 00:14:39.447
and responded to questions.

414
00:14:39.447 --> 00:14:40.647
[Voiceover] How exciting.

415
00:14:40.647 --> 00:14:42.527
<v ->I think that just really reflects how much</v>

416
00:14:42.527 --> 00:14:45.487
people are excited by this new way to give back.

417
00:14:45.487 --> 00:14:47.407
It's very unique, you know, there's nothing else

418
00:14:47.407 --> 00:14:49.667
really like it out there right now, so.

419
00:14:49.667 --> 00:14:52.167
[Voiceover] Well, lets talk about the nuts and bolts of it.

420
00:14:52.167 --> 00:14:56.067
So say I want to begin lending some money

421
00:14:56.067 --> 00:14:58.647
to some of the people that you have on your site.

422
00:14:58.647 --> 00:15:01.647
How does the process begin and what

423
00:15:01.647 --> 00:15:04.927
is the rate, is there an interest or rate of return it?

424
00:15:04.927 --> 00:15:08.507
And then in addition to that, what is the

425
00:15:08.507 --> 00:15:12.727
level of default, for example, when people

426
00:15:12.727 --> 00:15:14.067
just weren't able to do it?

427
00:15:14.067 --> 00:15:17.627
<v ->So currently we don't have a financial return.</v>

428
00:15:17.627 --> 00:15:20.567
So if you loan $25, assuming the entrepreneur

429
00:15:20.567 --> 00:15:23.787
pays back $25, the most you can get is $25.

430
00:15:23.787 --> 00:15:26.147
Now, that's how we started because its very simple.

431
00:15:26.147 --> 00:15:29.547
mechanically to do it that way.

432
00:15:29.547 --> 00:15:31.987
So, of course there are ideas of, in the future,

433
00:15:31.987 --> 00:15:33.867
we could offer interest rates, but right now

434
00:15:33.867 --> 00:15:35.227
we just don't have a way to do that.

435
00:15:35.227 --> 00:15:37.187
So you would come to the Kiva website

436
00:15:37.187 --> 00:15:40.647
www.kiva.org, and then you'd click on lend

437
00:15:40.647 --> 00:15:43.527
and you'd just browse and at times there are

438
00:15:43.527 --> 00:15:46.155
600, you know, entrepreneurs needing a loan

439
00:15:46.155 --> 00:15:48.515
at that point in time, from countries all around the world.

440
00:15:48.515 --> 00:15:52.035
It can be very fun just to click your way through

441
00:15:52.035 --> 00:15:53.755
and you're actually getting a glimpse

442
00:15:53.755 --> 00:15:54.795
into these people's lives.

443
00:15:54.795 --> 00:15:56.395
Usually, people choose somebody

444
00:15:56.395 --> 00:15:58.355
that they connect with for some reason.

445
00:15:58.355 --> 00:16:00.215
Whether they are targeting women,

446
00:16:00.215 --> 00:16:02.915
or whether, um, I talked to a man once

447
00:16:02.915 --> 00:16:05.065
who is a mechanic and he found somebody

448
00:16:05.065 --> 00:16:05.885
whose a mechanic and he told me that he was

449
00:16:05.885 --> 00:16:07.845
clicking on the picture and trying to enlarge

450
00:16:07.845 --> 00:16:10.345
the tools to see what tools they use in Ecuador,

451
00:16:10.345 --> 00:16:12.625
so people find somebody that appeals to them,

452
00:16:12.625 --> 00:16:14.725
and then they'll just choose how much

453
00:16:14.725 --> 00:16:16.685
they want to contribute, it's in $25 chunks

454
00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:18.985
so you can start at $25 and then

455
00:16:18.985 --> 00:16:20.565
just checkout through PayPal

456
00:16:20.565 --> 00:16:23.105
or using your credit card, just like any other website.

457
00:16:23.105 --> 00:16:25.373
[Voiceover] How does that work if,

458
00:16:25.373 --> 00:16:27.975
that same mechanic has 30 other mechanics

459
00:16:27.975 --> 00:16:30.255
form the Western world that are looking

460
00:16:30.255 --> 00:16:32.715
at his picture saying, oh I want to help this fellow.

461
00:16:32.715 --> 00:16:35.095
Is there a certain, sort of cutoff point,

462
00:16:35.095 --> 00:16:36.695
where there is a maximum amount

463
00:16:36.695 --> 00:16:38.095
that's loaned to any individual?

464
00:16:38.095 --> 00:16:39.035
<v ->Oh, of course.</v>

465
00:16:39.035 --> 00:16:40.675
Just like if you were to go to a bank

466
00:16:40.675 --> 00:16:43.955
and apply for a loan for, say you were

467
00:16:43.955 --> 00:16:44.725
going to start a business.

468
00:16:44.725 --> 00:16:48.505
The person at the bank would talk to you about how much

469
00:16:48.505 --> 00:16:51.565
you needed, and also talk to you about the repayment terms

470
00:16:51.565 --> 00:16:53.365
that you need, like how much are you going to make

471
00:16:53.365 --> 00:16:55.705
in repayments over how long.

472
00:16:55.705 --> 00:16:56.765
When do you think your going to be done?

473
00:16:56.765 --> 00:16:58.605
Is that going to work, do you need longer?

474
00:16:58.605 --> 00:17:02.145
And the exact same process happens with our clients.

475
00:17:02.145 --> 00:17:03.555
[Voiceover] So their picture comes off the web

476
00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:05.431
once that has been fulfilled I take it?

477
00:17:05.431 --> 00:17:07.131
<v ->Exactly, once it's been fulfilled</v>

478
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:08.931
it's still on the website so you can

479
00:17:08.931 --> 00:17:11.031
check back on them and see what's going on.

480
00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:12.431
If there's been an update added.

481
00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:14.051
But you just can't add any more money.

482
00:17:14.051 --> 00:17:15.131
[Voiceover] You can't add any more money to it.

483
00:17:15.131 --> 00:17:20.131
And how often do people, are they able to honor the loans?

484
00:17:20.151 --> 00:17:21.771
What percentage of the time?

485
00:17:21.771 --> 00:17:24.371
<v ->You know, it's really interesting that we have</v>

486
00:17:24.371 --> 00:17:26.091
this perception that the poor wouldn't

487
00:17:26.091 --> 00:17:27.251
pay back, but actually--

488
00:17:27.251 --> 00:17:28.391
[Voiceover] I think the opposite.

489
00:17:28.391 --> 00:17:30.331
<v ->The poor pay back, because it's their chance.</v>

490
00:17:30.331 --> 00:17:32.291
You know, and they have so much more to lose

491
00:17:32.291 --> 00:17:35.851
then if I were to get a loan for my third car, you know.

492
00:17:35.851 --> 00:17:38.451
So we actually, on the Kiva website, we have

493
00:17:38.451 --> 00:17:41.331
a repayment rate over 98% and the industry

494
00:17:41.331 --> 00:17:43.391
average is around 97 - 98%.

495
00:17:43.391 --> 00:17:45.791
[Voiceover] That is fabulous, especially when

496
00:17:45.791 --> 00:17:49.411
you look at the amount of irresponsibility

497
00:17:49.411 --> 00:17:52.371
in the financial sector at really high levels where,

498
00:17:52.371 --> 00:17:54.491
ah, it's someone else's money, we don't care.

499
00:17:54.491 --> 00:17:55.771
<v ->Exactly.</v>

500
00:17:55.771 --> 00:17:56.991
[Voiceover] We're still getting our bonuses.

501
00:17:56.991 --> 00:17:59.231
This really takes it down to a level it matters.

502
00:17:59.231 --> 00:18:01.051
I have read those statistics before.

503
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:04.411
That it's often in the most underprivileged

504
00:18:04.411 --> 00:18:06.571
neighborhoods and regions of the world

505
00:18:06.571 --> 00:18:10.331
that has the greatest accountability to debts.

506
00:18:10.331 --> 00:18:12.531
<v ->Exactly. You know you think, when you really</v>

507
00:18:12.531 --> 00:18:14.871
break it down and think about if I didn't have

508
00:18:14.871 --> 00:18:17.511
access to financial services, when you get

509
00:18:17.511 --> 00:18:19.311
that chance if no one else is offering you

510
00:18:19.311 --> 00:18:21.884
that chance, you think about Yenku, for example.

511
00:18:21.884 --> 00:18:23.764
Somebody that doesn't have any hands.

512
00:18:23.764 --> 00:18:26.224
No one else would even give him a job,

513
00:18:26.224 --> 00:18:27.365
let alone give him a loan.

514
00:18:27.365 --> 00:18:31.184
So he found one organization that was going to

515
00:18:31.184 --> 00:18:34.144
give him a loan, he actually made early repayments.

516
00:18:34.144 --> 00:18:35.684
Yeah.

517
00:18:35.684 --> 00:18:36.664
[Voiceover] Isn't that amazing.

518
00:18:36.664 --> 00:18:38.244
<v ->So you think about that level of</v>

519
00:18:38.244 --> 00:18:40.324
accountability for your loan, it really shows

520
00:18:40.324 --> 00:18:44.404
what an impact this loan can make.

521
00:18:44.404 --> 00:18:47.068
[Voiceover] I mean, its just so, such an incredibly

522
00:18:47.068 --> 00:18:50.828
heartwarming endeavor that's going on

523
00:18:50.828 --> 00:18:53.108
and all these people that are here in the room,

524
00:18:53.108 --> 00:18:55.248
from all different backgrounds,

525
00:18:55.248 --> 00:18:57.628
so that they can communicate with

526
00:18:57.628 --> 00:18:59.088
the various countries.

527
00:18:59.088 --> 00:18:59.948
<v ->Yeah</v>

528
00:18:59.948 --> 00:19:01.788
[Voiceover] And as you say microloan institutions,

529
00:19:01.788 --> 00:19:03.728
what draws them here?

530
00:19:03.728 --> 00:19:07.188
I mean, besides the feel good part.

531
00:19:07.188 --> 00:19:09.128
I mean, is everyone volunteering,

532
00:19:09.128 --> 00:19:10.808
or are they paid staff here?

533
00:19:10.808 --> 00:19:12.068
How does this work?

534
00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:14.008
<v ->We have about 30 paid staff.</v>

535
00:19:14.008 --> 00:19:17.108
We have hundreds of volunteers.

536
00:19:17.108 --> 00:19:20.348
We have over 300 volunteers that

537
00:19:20.348 --> 00:19:24.208
look at every business loan that comes on the website.

538
00:19:24.208 --> 00:19:25.988
If it needs a translation, they translate it.

539
00:19:25.988 --> 00:19:28.068
If it needs editing so that you can understand,

540
00:19:28.068 --> 00:19:29.282
they edit and they do it for free.

541
00:19:29.282 --> 00:19:32.022
And it's happening 24 hours, around the clock.

542
00:19:32.022 --> 00:19:34.062
Think of that kind of dedication.

543
00:19:34.062 --> 00:19:35.862
And also the fellows that are downstairs, right now.

544
00:19:35.862 --> 00:19:37.662
There are 30 fellows that are going to depart

545
00:19:37.662 --> 00:19:42.062
for Sierra Leone and Asia, countries all around the world.

546
00:19:42.062 --> 00:19:43.582
They're going to work for free with our partners

547
00:19:43.582 --> 00:19:45.922
for a minimum of ten weeks.

548
00:19:45.922 --> 00:19:47.342
Some people are going for up to a year.

549
00:19:47.342 --> 00:19:49.642
So, you know, it's really a great question.

550
00:19:49.642 --> 00:19:51.162
What really draws people to do this?

551
00:19:51.162 --> 00:19:53.802
And I think the answer is, um,

552
00:19:53.802 --> 00:19:56.382
people want to help, you know that.

553
00:19:56.382 --> 00:19:59.222
People always want to help, but when you find

554
00:19:59.222 --> 00:20:03.422
a way that's so direct, you know, we hunger for that.

555
00:20:03.422 --> 00:20:07.483
We hunger to make an impact and to think

556
00:20:07.483 --> 00:20:09.862
that you can really change someone's life,

557
00:20:09.862 --> 00:20:12.302
you know, it's such a phrase that's thrown around.

558
00:20:12.302 --> 00:20:15.042
And I think that so often you hear it

559
00:20:15.042 --> 00:20:17.302
and youi just disregard it because

560
00:20:17.302 --> 00:20:19.643
you thinks it's impossible, but I think

561
00:20:19.643 --> 00:20:22.563
in many ways Kiva has given hope to alot of people

562
00:20:22.563 --> 00:20:26.412
that have felt like, you know, you can't really, you know,

563
00:20:26.412 --> 00:20:28.301
help global poverty, it's so massive.

564
00:20:28.301 --> 00:20:30.921
But we've broken it down in ways

565
00:20:30.921 --> 00:20:33.561
that show people you can.

566
00:20:33.561 --> 00:20:36.301
And what's interesting is we started

567
00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:40.021
Kiva to empower the poor through financial services,

568
00:20:40.021 --> 00:20:42.421
and what we've found is that it's

569
00:20:42.421 --> 00:20:44.201
empowering the lenders in ways

570
00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:45.921
that I don't think we really predicted.

571
00:20:45.921 --> 00:20:47.861
To hear people write to us and say

572
00:20:47.861 --> 00:20:51.001
Thank you for giving me the opportunity

573
00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:53.900
to make a difference, I never thought I could.

574
00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.301
I read a letter from one lady who said

575
00:20:56.301 --> 00:20:58.960
I'm on disability, I barely have enough

576
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.981
to pay my bills each month, and you

577
00:21:01.981 --> 00:21:04.961
gave me a way to feel like I can impact

578
00:21:04.961 --> 00:21:07.181
someone on the other side of the world, thank you.

579
00:21:07.181 --> 00:21:12.181
So it's been such an enriching experience

580
00:21:12.621 --> 00:21:16.541
to see that not only you can help people

581
00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:18.561
on the other side of the world through microfinance

582
00:21:18.561 --> 00:21:21.981
but all these ripple effects that happen

583
00:21:21.981 --> 00:21:24.501
with both people contributing the funds,

584
00:21:24.501 --> 00:21:28.341
the staff here, the fellows that say

585
00:21:28.341 --> 00:21:32.421
please take me, I want to go and help, here are my skills.

586
00:21:32.421 --> 00:21:36.641
We've had people come along that are venture capitalists

587
00:21:36.641 --> 00:21:39.240
that say I have particular business skills,

588
00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.151
I can go and help this microfinance institution,

589
00:21:41.151 --> 00:21:42.311
tell me what to do.

590
00:21:42.311 --> 00:21:44.570
So, there are, of course, these ripple effects that

591
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:46.288
go around the world and that's why

592
00:21:46.288 --> 00:21:51.028
Kiva's mission is not to give as much money as we can

593
00:21:51.028 --> 00:21:52.789
to microfinance institutions.

594
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:54.369
Our mission is to connect people

595
00:21:54.369 --> 00:21:56.789
because we see that when you make these connections,

596
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:59.669
something magical happens and it's hard to define,

597
00:21:59.669 --> 00:22:01.448
and it's hard to put numbers to it,

598
00:22:01.448 --> 00:22:02.889
but we know it's magical.

599
00:22:02.889 --> 00:22:05.309
[Voiceover] Indeed.

600
00:22:05.309 --> 00:22:07.529
Well, um, I have some friends that are

601
00:22:07.529 --> 00:22:10.189
already doing this and absolutely love the experience

602
00:22:10.189 --> 00:22:12.188
and I've been waiting to meet you after reading

603
00:22:12.188 --> 00:22:15.588
about you in O magazine, so that we can do the same.

604
00:22:15.588 --> 00:22:17.289
And I thank you for your time.

605
00:22:17.289 --> 00:22:19.169
This is absolutely beautiful, it shows what can happen

606
00:22:19.169 --> 00:22:21.648
when you have absolutely right intentions.

607
00:22:21.648 --> 00:22:23.389
<v ->Well, thanks so much from coming by.</v>

608
00:22:23.389 --> 00:22:24.768
I'm glad you got to see the office.

609
00:22:24.768 --> 00:22:25.869
[Voiceover] Me too.

610
00:22:29.079 --> 00:22:31.148
<v ->To participate in Kiva's microloan program</v>

611
00:22:31.148 --> 00:22:34.348
just go to Kiva.org and begin following the manual.

612
00:22:34.348 --> 00:22:36.469
It's definately worth reading some of the

613
00:22:36.469 --> 00:22:38.849
personal stories first to become inspired

614
00:22:38.849 --> 00:22:41.389
as to just how meaningful your help can be.

615
00:22:41.389 --> 00:22:42.509
I love this group.

616
00:22:42.509 --> 00:22:45.308
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

617
00:22:45.308 --> 00:22:50.228
