00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:08.666
<v ->Paul Perry has authored or coauthored 10 books</v>

2
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.954
on the subject of near-death experiences.

3
00:00:10.954 --> 00:00:14.471
This 23 year long fascination began when he was approached

4
00:00:14.471 --> 00:00:16.410
to write a book titled The Light Beyond

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.873
with Dr. Raymond Moody.

6
00:00:17.873 --> 00:00:20.880
Ten books later, Paul has used his knowledge of the subject

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.643
and skills to produce a wonderful documentary

8
00:00:23.643 --> 00:00:25.141
titled Afterlife.

9
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:27.579
The story follows a handful of people through their journey

10
00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.054
out of the body and back

11
00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:32.067
using science as a backdrop of understanding.

12
00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:34.619
<v Voiceover>Paul, it was wonderful watching your film</v>

13
00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:35.318
last night.

14
00:00:35.318 --> 00:00:36.126
<v ->Well thank you very much.</v>

15
00:00:36.126 --> 00:00:38.071
<v Voiceover>And you've done a beautiful job on Afterlife</v>

16
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.934
and it's really a subject that I think is innately dear

17
00:00:41.934 --> 00:00:43.931
to every human being, whether we've had

18
00:00:43.931 --> 00:00:45.173
the experience or not.

19
00:00:45.173 --> 00:00:47.666
And there's been a lot of progress in the field

20
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.611
and you've coauthored 10?

21
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:53.444
<v ->Ten books on near-death experiences.</v>

22
00:00:53.444 --> 00:00:55.817
<v Voiceover>And you have one of them,</v>

23
00:00:55.817 --> 00:00:57.477
a New York Times best seller.

24
00:00:57.477 --> 00:00:59.784
<v ->There have been four New York Times best sellers actually.</v>

25
00:00:59.784 --> 00:01:01.221
<v Voiceover>And is this the recent one,</v>

26
00:01:01.221 --> 00:01:02.321
The Evidence of the Afterlife?

27
00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:05.019
<v ->That's correct. That was in February of 2010.</v>

28
00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.653
<v Voiceover>2010 and you cowrote it with Jeffrey Long</v>

29
00:01:07.653 --> 00:01:10.360
who is featured in the film, right?

30
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.091
<v ->Right.</v>

31
00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:12.655
<v Voiceover>Along with Raymond Moody.</v>

32
00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:13.767
<v ->That's correct, yeah.</v>

33
00:01:13.767 --> 00:01:15.737
<v Voiceover>And we've talked with Dr. Moody</v>

34
00:01:15.737 --> 00:01:19.406
about the subject and his whole personal development

35
00:01:19.406 --> 00:01:20.834
of his work.

36
00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:23.829
And so now we want to look at some of the specifics

37
00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.176
that have happened that you have found

38
00:01:25.176 --> 00:01:26.973
through your research in terms of

39
00:01:26.973 --> 00:01:29.245
commonality of experience and so forth.

40
00:01:29.245 --> 00:01:30.940
And there are several things that

41
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.611
struck me during this film.

42
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:35.781
And so this is almost a continuation of our conversation

43
00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:38.753
in a sense with Dr. Moody because we're going on

44
00:01:38.753 --> 00:01:40.622
now into these areas.

45
00:01:40.622 --> 00:01:43.885
And one of the things that I think

46
00:01:43.885 --> 00:01:45.763
a lot of people have been curious about

47
00:01:45.763 --> 00:01:48.700
that you address in this is what happens

48
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.573
to a person having a near-death experience

49
00:01:51.573 --> 00:01:55.310
based on their thinking,

50
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.735
their religious beliefs or indoctrinations,

51
00:01:58.735 --> 00:02:00.903
societal indoctrinations and so forth.

52
00:02:00.903 --> 00:02:03.585
What have been the common themes that you've seen

53
00:02:03.585 --> 00:02:05.315
or are they not common?

54
00:02:05.315 --> 00:02:08.078
<v ->Well they are fairly common and that's the beauty</v>

55
00:02:08.078 --> 00:02:10.121
of near-death experiences is that

56
00:02:10.121 --> 00:02:14.347
the traits seem very common and the transformations

57
00:02:14.347 --> 00:02:16.623
afterwards are fairly common.

58
00:02:16.623 --> 00:02:19.684
And one of the transformations that happens to people

59
00:02:19.684 --> 00:02:21.298
who have near-death experiences is

60
00:02:21.298 --> 00:02:25.321
that they tend to become more type A

61
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:26.598
type A without the anger.

62
00:02:26.598 --> 00:02:29.103
So they have a real zest for life

63
00:02:29.103 --> 00:02:31.436
and they have a zest for learning.

64
00:02:33.326 --> 00:02:36.510
Which in some ways surprises me and in some ways doesn't.

65
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.518
You know, that they come out of this experience

66
00:02:38.518 --> 00:02:40.388
wanting to know more and more

67
00:02:40.388 --> 00:02:42.257
about the world they live in.

68
00:02:42.257 --> 00:02:46.645
The other thing is is that they become a lot more spiritual

69
00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:50.024
but they become less religious.

70
00:02:50.024 --> 00:02:50.991
And I always think...

71
00:02:50.991 --> 00:02:52.020
<v Voiceover>Big distinction.</v>

72
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.219
<v ->It's a huge distinction.</v>

73
00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:55.100
The distinction to me is that

74
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.865
it's almost like

75
00:03:00.625 --> 00:03:04.814
well, it's like being, how do I put this?

76
00:03:05.434 --> 00:03:07.194
It's the difference between working for the government

77
00:03:07.194 --> 00:03:08.573
and being an American.

78
00:03:08.573 --> 00:03:09.612
You know?

79
00:03:09.612 --> 00:03:12.253
And it's that way with people who have

80
00:03:12.253 --> 00:03:13.770
near-death experiences

81
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.057
is that they become far more spiritual

82
00:03:16.057 --> 00:03:18.321
but they become less religious.

83
00:03:18.321 --> 00:03:21.154
So you find a lot of people who tend

84
00:03:21.154 --> 00:03:22.954
to drop out of churches

85
00:03:22.954 --> 00:03:25.589
and just become more spiritual.

86
00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:27.118
So near-death experiences really

87
00:03:27.118 --> 00:03:28.996
aren't great for church attendance,

88
00:03:28.996 --> 00:03:32.537
but they're kind of great for international consciousness.

89
00:03:32.537 --> 00:03:34.801
<v Voiceover>I can understand that because if you come back</v>

90
00:03:34.801 --> 00:03:38.771
with a sense of love, you know, as experienced

91
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:41.012
on a different level than what you may have been

92
00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:43.648
able to access prior to the near-death experience,

93
00:03:43.648 --> 00:03:47.081
for most people that simply almost

94
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:51.121
falls within the realm of whatever we call loosely spirit.

95
00:03:52.141 --> 00:03:55.385
So it makes sense, so it has to then be spiritual in nature

96
00:03:55.385 --> 00:03:56.894
for a person.

97
00:03:57.824 --> 00:04:01.060
And yet there are these overlays where you hear people

98
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.471
that have these near-death experiences often say

99
00:04:03.471 --> 00:04:06.757
the image of Jesus came to them,

100
00:04:06.757 --> 00:04:10.542
or the image, if you're Islamic does

101
00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:12.543
the image of Muhammad come to people?

102
00:04:12.543 --> 00:04:13.244
<v ->Well...</v>

103
00:04:13.244 --> 00:04:14.875
<v Voiceover>Does Buddha come to people?</v>

104
00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:18.216
<v ->Yes, and I think Raymond would agree</v>

105
00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:21.281
as well as other researchers that when you talk to people

106
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:24.319
about what they see in the light, you know,

107
00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:26.119
frequently you'll hear people say

108
00:04:26.119 --> 00:04:28.255
you know I saw Jesus

109
00:04:28.255 --> 00:04:30.391
if they're western orientation.

110
00:04:30.391 --> 00:04:33.433
Some children say I saw Santa Clause

111
00:04:33.433 --> 00:04:35.326
or I saw Grandpa.

112
00:04:35.326 --> 00:04:37.299
But then when you zero in a little bit more

113
00:04:37.299 --> 00:04:41.235
and you say, well, specifically what did they look like?

114
00:04:41.235 --> 00:04:43.267
Blah blah blah, they'll say, well,

115
00:04:43.267 --> 00:04:46.213
I didn't necessarily see features

116
00:04:46.213 --> 00:04:49.441
but I had the sense that it was Jesus

117
00:04:49.441 --> 00:04:51.275
or Santa Clause or Grandpa.

118
00:04:51.275 --> 00:04:53.481
And I think a lot of that relates to the fact

119
00:04:53.481 --> 00:04:55.823
that they feel that kind of comfort

120
00:04:55.823 --> 00:04:58.052
from the spirit that they're seeing in the light.

121
00:04:58.052 --> 00:05:00.418
<v Voiceover>That would make perfect sense.</v>

122
00:05:00.418 --> 00:05:03.692
And it's bringing in that trust and reverence

123
00:05:03.692 --> 00:05:05.456
that's already programmed within the being

124
00:05:05.456 --> 00:05:07.802
and applying an identity to it perhaps.

125
00:05:07.802 --> 00:05:09.069
<v ->Sure, I think that's true.</v>

126
00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:10.794
<v Voiceover>Which makes sense, it doesn't matter,</v>

127
00:05:10.794 --> 00:05:12.567
you're still having the experience.

128
00:05:12.567 --> 00:05:16.801
<v ->Yeah. Now I would love to spend more time with Muslims</v>

129
00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:18.679
who have had near-death experiences

130
00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:21.767
and see specifically what, find out specifically what

131
00:05:21.767 --> 00:05:23.474
it is they see in the light.

132
00:05:23.474 --> 00:05:25.239
<v Voiceover>I'm seeing a new book.</v>

133
00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:27.781
<v ->Well, actually we dealt with this to a large extent</v>

134
00:05:27.781 --> 00:05:29.476
in Evidence of the Afterlife

135
00:05:29.476 --> 00:05:32.054
where we had the luxury of having a lot of

136
00:05:32.054 --> 00:05:35.026
cross cultural near-death experiences.

137
00:05:35.026 --> 00:05:37.859
And we do find Muslims who see Muhammad

138
00:05:37.859 --> 00:05:40.924
which is, you know, not something you're supposed to do,

139
00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:42.503
you know he's not supposed to see

140
00:05:42.503 --> 00:05:45.335
representations of Muhammad.

141
00:05:45.335 --> 00:05:47.472
But they do anyway.

142
00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:49.770
<v Voiceover>Yeah and maybe an astronomer or astrophysicist</v>

143
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.010
would see the cosmos.

144
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.844
And many people see the cosmos anyway.

145
00:05:52.844 --> 00:05:55.178
<v ->They do see the cosmos, yeah sure.</v>

146
00:05:55.178 --> 00:05:56.675
<v Voiceover>Interesting.</v>

147
00:05:56.675 --> 00:06:00.248
And you, let's talk about children for a moment

148
00:06:00.248 --> 00:06:02.349
because a lot of times people say well this can

149
00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:05.507
certainly be an experience that has been conjured

150
00:06:06.527 --> 00:06:08.822
through, you know, our indoctrination

151
00:06:08.822 --> 00:06:11.260
or programming of some kind as we just talked about.

152
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.758
Religious or otherwise.

153
00:06:12.758 --> 00:06:15.904
But can you give us a couple or a few cases

154
00:06:15.904 --> 00:06:18.737
of children and what they experience.

155
00:06:19.957 --> 00:06:22.274
Essentially to help us understand that

156
00:06:22.274 --> 00:06:24.979
this is bypassing analysis and programming

157
00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:27.905
to the same degree as an adult near-death experience.

158
00:06:27.905 --> 00:06:30.146
<v ->Right. Well the beauty of dealing with children</v>

159
00:06:30.146 --> 00:06:33.954
is that they haven't been, as we call it Oprahized yet.

160
00:06:33.954 --> 00:06:37.016
They haven't seen a lot of these things on television.

161
00:06:37.016 --> 00:06:39.651
They haven't read about them or necessarily

162
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:41.254
talked about them with anyone else.

163
00:06:41.254 --> 00:06:42.716
They don't know anything about it.

164
00:06:42.716 --> 00:06:45.828
And suddenly a child will have a near death experience,

165
00:06:45.828 --> 00:06:48.963
they'll fall into a pool at the YMCA and drown

166
00:06:48.963 --> 00:06:51.331
or they'll have some kind of a disease.

167
00:06:51.331 --> 00:06:55.218
And they have an experience that is

168
00:06:55.218 --> 00:06:57.978
in many ways identical to an adult.

169
00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:02.184
The main difference with children is that they

170
00:07:02.184 --> 00:07:05.979
don't have much of a life review because they are children.

171
00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:09.021
And so that would be expected, but other than that

172
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:13.955
the experiences are fairly identical with adults.

173
00:07:13.955 --> 00:07:17.293
I did a book with Melvin Morse years ago

174
00:07:17.293 --> 00:07:19.929
called Closer to the Light and it dealt with children

175
00:07:19.929 --> 00:07:21.659
and near-death experiences.

176
00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:25.200
And one of the things we found in our study

177
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.636
of the children was that the light

178
00:07:28.636 --> 00:07:30.773
was hugely transformative.

179
00:07:30.773 --> 00:07:33.367
That children who

180
00:07:33.367 --> 00:07:35.678
somehow came into contact with the light

181
00:07:35.678 --> 00:07:39.044
were, as one child said, the light

182
00:07:39.044 --> 00:07:41.181
is where all the good things are.

183
00:07:41.181 --> 00:07:45.825
And we were able to do follow ups on some of these children

184
00:07:45.825 --> 00:07:48.492
and they've been transformed decades later

185
00:07:48.492 --> 00:07:50.384
by this experience.

186
00:07:50.384 --> 00:07:53.194
And we see the same thing with adults as well.

187
00:07:53.194 --> 00:07:56.003
The light is a very transformative element.

188
00:07:56.003 --> 00:08:00.006
And it's variously described as being

189
00:08:00.006 --> 00:08:02.873
just a brighter than bright light

190
00:08:02.873 --> 00:08:06.171
all the way to being a light that has substance

191
00:08:06.171 --> 00:08:09.677
that feels almost gelatinous that they go into it

192
00:08:09.677 --> 00:08:13.253
and they fell like they're walking through jello in a way.

193
00:08:13.253 --> 00:08:15.679
<v Voiceover>And some of this is almost, it seems that</v>

194
00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:19.290
filmmakers have captured some of what people describe

195
00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.461
to an extent, I mean it's fantasized a bit

196
00:08:21.461 --> 00:08:25.397
in films like What Dreams May Come, for example.

197
00:08:25.397 --> 00:08:29.202
Where you have this third dimensional looking landscape

198
00:08:29.202 --> 00:08:32.964
but with this gelatinous or otherworldly type of light

199
00:08:32.964 --> 00:08:35.541
and experience of colors beyond the spectrum

200
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:37.445
we can perceive with our eyes,

201
00:08:37.445 --> 00:08:40.972
which would seem like it's kind of a close off

202
00:08:40.972 --> 00:08:43.213
dimensional field to where we are

203
00:08:43.213 --> 00:08:44.745
but not exactly.

204
00:08:44.745 --> 00:08:48.449
<v ->It is, and you know if you look at ancient history,</v>

205
00:08:48.449 --> 00:08:50.945
if you look at the Egyptians who dealt

206
00:08:50.945 --> 00:08:53.186
with the afterlife extensively in their art

207
00:08:53.186 --> 00:08:55.229
and in their other parts of their culture,

208
00:08:55.229 --> 00:08:59.490
they believed that the afterlife was right here.

209
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.872
And that we would just step across into the afterlife.

210
00:09:03.872 --> 00:09:07.468
And so much of their art is representational of that.

211
00:09:07.468 --> 00:09:11.274
That literally you have people duck hunting

212
00:09:11.274 --> 00:09:13.975
in some of their art who are dead

213
00:09:13.975 --> 00:09:15.763
right next to you when you're duck hunting.

214
00:09:15.763 --> 00:09:17.284
You know, things like that.

215
00:09:17.284 --> 00:09:20.013
And that was their belief is that you just passed through

216
00:09:20.013 --> 00:09:21.917
kind of this little mirror.

217
00:09:21.917 --> 00:09:24.587
And it's, speaking of the Egyptians,

218
00:09:26.347 --> 00:09:27.652
well you know they are the first

219
00:09:27.652 --> 00:09:29.521
resurrection culture in history.

220
00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:33.933
And their whole culture was based on

221
00:09:33.933 --> 00:09:35.695
resurrection beliefs.

222
00:09:35.695 --> 00:09:40.025
And there are egyptologists who believe

223
00:09:40.025 --> 00:09:43.234
that the two sides

224
00:09:43.234 --> 00:09:45.080
of Egypt unified,

225
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.005
north and south, they unified around

226
00:09:48.005 --> 00:09:50.710
things that were like death experiences.

227
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.346
Now they describe these before Raymond Moody

228
00:09:53.346 --> 00:09:55.215
described near-death experiences.

229
00:09:55.215 --> 00:09:57.618
But what they've said in their writing was

230
00:09:57.618 --> 00:10:00.625
these people would sit around the campfire

231
00:10:00.625 --> 00:10:04.132
and they would talk about almost drowning in the Nile

232
00:10:04.132 --> 00:10:06.256
or being attacked by hippos when there actually

233
00:10:06.256 --> 00:10:10.099
were animals in the Nile, or crocodiles or having accidents.

234
00:10:10.099 --> 00:10:14.070
And going up tunnels, seeing bright lights,

235
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.538
seeing dead relatives, having their heart

236
00:10:17.538 --> 00:10:21.741
weighed for it's goodness against the feather of truth.

237
00:10:21.741 --> 00:10:25.816
And if when you're in Egypt you see

238
00:10:25.816 --> 00:10:28.516
the representations of near-death experiences

239
00:10:28.516 --> 00:10:31.221
on the walls very vividly.

240
00:10:31.221 --> 00:10:34.959
And it says to me that, you know,

241
00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:36.724
the question what came first,

242
00:10:36.724 --> 00:10:38.764
the near-death experience or religion?

243
00:10:38.764 --> 00:10:41.133
To me the answer is near-death experience.

244
00:10:41.133 --> 00:10:44.035
And I think near-death experiences are really in many ways

245
00:10:44.035 --> 00:10:47.089
the wellspring for religion.

246
00:10:49.199 --> 00:10:53.239
It's religion's, religion is mankind's attempt

247
00:10:53.239 --> 00:10:56.351
to understand near-death experiences.

248
00:10:56.351 --> 00:10:58.481
It's mankind's attempt to understand

249
00:10:58.481 --> 00:11:00.280
what happens when we die.

250
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.322
Then of course it grew into this enormous bureaucracy.

251
00:11:03.322 --> 00:11:06.991
But if you then look at how

252
00:11:06.991 --> 00:11:11.019
near-death experiences effect people now, it's like

253
00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:13.591
they go back and they eliminate all the bureaucracy

254
00:11:13.591 --> 00:11:15.228
and they go back to the pure form.

255
00:11:15.228 --> 00:11:17.561
<v Voiceover>And it's as though the Egyptians had the</v>

256
00:11:17.561 --> 00:11:19.965
cultural and spiritual framework

257
00:11:19.965 --> 00:11:23.773
to be able to comfortably articulate these experiences

258
00:11:23.773 --> 00:11:26.037
with each other and then preserve them

259
00:11:26.037 --> 00:11:28.463
in their hieroglyphics and such for future times

260
00:11:28.463 --> 00:11:30.414
to which right now we're coming back

261
00:11:30.414 --> 00:11:32.410
kind of full circle.

262
00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:34.622
<v ->But to carry that further, I think many cultures did.</v>

263
00:11:34.622 --> 00:11:37.910
I think many cultures parallel to the Egyptians,

264
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.685
before the Egyptians, even all the way back to

265
00:11:41.735 --> 00:11:45.088
this temple they found recently in Turkey, Gobekli Temple.

266
00:11:45.088 --> 00:11:47.422
<v Voiceover>Yes. Interesting.</v>

267
00:11:47.422 --> 00:11:49.470
<v ->Oh yeah. And I'm dying to start...</v>

268
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.195
<v Voiceover>Brand new, people are just starting</v>

269
00:11:51.195 --> 00:11:52.069
to look into it.

270
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:54.040
<v ->I know and I want to go there so bad</v>

271
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.967
because I want to take a look at this

272
00:11:55.967 --> 00:11:57.906
in light of near-death experiences.

273
00:11:57.906 --> 00:12:00.867
I want to look at the hieroglyphs that they have

274
00:12:00.867 --> 00:12:03.479
on these stellas that they found.

275
00:12:03.479 --> 00:12:05.879
<v Voiceover>Fascinating. We just interviewed Gregg Braden</v>

276
00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:07.807
who was telling us about that site as well.

277
00:12:07.807 --> 00:12:09.955
And that is, you're bringing a really

278
00:12:09.955 --> 00:12:11.487
interesting overlay to that.

279
00:12:11.487 --> 00:12:13.321
I think we're going to see people flocking there.

280
00:12:13.321 --> 00:12:15.257
Someone needs to organize a tour it seems like.

281
00:12:15.257 --> 00:12:16.894
<v ->I think it's a tremendously exciting thought.</v>

282
00:12:16.894 --> 00:12:19.832
And you know, if you say okay, you know the Egyptians

283
00:12:19.832 --> 00:12:23.431
are the first resurrection, you know,

284
00:12:23.431 --> 00:12:24.929
culture in history.

285
00:12:24.929 --> 00:12:26.240
But are they really?

286
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.841
Well they might not be because there's so much

287
00:12:28.841 --> 00:12:30.710
of antiquity that gets destroyed,

288
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.473
so much of this stuff was made out of wood

289
00:12:33.473 --> 00:12:34.646
and wood has rotted.

290
00:12:34.646 --> 00:12:36.910
It's gone, cultures disappear.

291
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.242
Cultures sprang up in places where

292
00:12:39.242 --> 00:12:41.252
we haven't even been yet.

293
00:12:41.252 --> 00:12:44.979
<v Voiceover>Yes. Well let's forward that</v>

294
00:12:44.979 --> 00:12:49.019
from resurrection to the concept of recycling.

295
00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:50.854
<v ->Recycling, okay.</v>

296
00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:52.630
<v Voiceover>And talk about what</v>

297
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.300
some of the experiencers have seen

298
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.098
by way of what they seeing as beings

299
00:12:58.098 --> 00:13:01.006
waiting or preparing apparently on the other side too.

300
00:13:01.006 --> 00:13:04.930
Come back and hop on the wheel again.

301
00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.211
Can you talk about that and maybe

302
00:13:07.211 --> 00:13:08.639
even give a couple examples.

303
00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:11.484
<v ->Well you do hear occasionally from people</v>

304
00:13:11.484 --> 00:13:13.852
who have near-death experiences that when

305
00:13:13.852 --> 00:13:16.952
they go into a heavenly realm they see

306
00:13:16.952 --> 00:13:19.158
spirits ready to be born

307
00:13:20.038 --> 00:13:23.988
and spirits who are being reborn again.

308
00:13:23.988 --> 00:13:27.388
Reborn of course means spirits ready to be born

309
00:13:27.388 --> 00:13:29.803
and spirits ready to be reborn.

310
00:13:32.423 --> 00:13:36.305
And it changes their view about

311
00:13:38.765 --> 00:13:40.581
you know, are we born again?

312
00:13:40.581 --> 00:13:42.799
It changes their view about past lives.

313
00:13:43.549 --> 00:13:46.171
And I don't know much about that, you know,

314
00:13:46.171 --> 00:13:48.171
for me it's just not,

315
00:13:50.614 --> 00:13:53.513
I think Young called it a live option.

316
00:13:53.513 --> 00:13:55.826
You know, I think what he was referring to

317
00:13:55.826 --> 00:13:59.832
is we tend to believe all of our lives

318
00:13:59.832 --> 00:14:02.421
what we were raised with as children.

319
00:14:02.421 --> 00:14:04.197
And that's our live options.

320
00:14:04.197 --> 00:14:08.806
And to me past lives aren't really a live option.

321
00:14:08.806 --> 00:14:11.705
But they're becoming more and more that way

322
00:14:11.705 --> 00:14:13.272
the more I talk to people who have had

323
00:14:13.272 --> 00:14:14.805
these near-death experiences.

324
00:14:14.805 --> 00:14:17.673
And one example I can give you is a Mormon woman

325
00:14:17.673 --> 00:14:21.214
in Mesa, Arizona who had a near-death experience

326
00:14:21.214 --> 00:14:24.592
and she saw these,

327
00:14:24.592 --> 00:14:29.085
the best I can describe it is banks of spirits

328
00:14:29.085 --> 00:14:30.719
ready to be reborn.

329
00:14:31.619 --> 00:14:33.895
And I don't know that that's
<v Voiceover>Shocked her.</v>

330
00:14:33.895 --> 00:14:35.398
<v ->It shocked her, I don't think that's really</v>

331
00:14:35.398 --> 00:14:36.695
part of the Mormon doctrine.

332
00:14:36.695 --> 00:14:41.293
And you know she's trying to integrate that into her life.

333
00:14:41.293 --> 00:14:44.726
That's an issue with many people

334
00:14:44.726 --> 00:14:46.607
who have near-death experiences as well is

335
00:14:46.607 --> 00:14:48.836
how do they integrate this into their lives.

336
00:14:48.836 --> 00:14:50.876
How do they integrate new information?

337
00:14:50.876 --> 00:14:53.047
Because we all get wedded to certain beliefs.

338
00:14:53.047 --> 00:14:55.056
<v Voiceover>Yeah I find that part fascinating</v>

339
00:14:55.056 --> 00:14:58.283
and looking at it from a little different perspective

340
00:14:58.283 --> 00:15:00.089
just to kind of dovetail with it for a moment,

341
00:15:00.089 --> 00:15:01.691
there's a woman named Carol Bowman

342
00:15:01.691 --> 00:15:06.057
who has been in the area of researching

343
00:15:06.057 --> 00:15:09.296
children with their past life recall.

344
00:15:09.296 --> 00:15:12.129
And some of it is beyond staggering.

345
00:15:12.129 --> 00:15:14.636
I mean these children are saying, Mommy we have to

346
00:15:14.636 --> 00:15:16.308
go back to the house with the blue steps

347
00:15:16.308 --> 00:15:18.177
at the other part of town where Grandma lived

348
00:15:18.177 --> 00:15:20.569
and going back into their rooms and knowing the wallpaper,

349
00:15:20.569 --> 00:15:22.540
knowing everything that happened and the relationships

350
00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.442
between people, and even more so in foreign countries

351
00:15:25.442 --> 00:15:28.287
in the east where it's not prohibited

352
00:15:28.287 --> 00:15:29.854
to think about such things.

353
00:15:29.854 --> 00:15:33.024
So it would, if you start looking at the collective

354
00:15:33.024 --> 00:15:34.986
of all these works you can begin seeing

355
00:15:34.986 --> 00:15:37.087
a potential portrait emerging there

356
00:15:37.087 --> 00:15:38.956
that would bring up another set of questions

357
00:15:38.956 --> 00:15:41.360
about, so how inherits the Earth, you know?

358
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.632
<v ->Well you frequently see children talking about past lives.</v>

359
00:15:45.632 --> 00:15:48.001
And you know, I was here before, or you know

360
00:15:48.001 --> 00:15:50.810
so and so lived, you know I lived here or I lived there.

361
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:54.340
And it makes me wonder if it isn't

362
00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.776
some kind of an ability that we lose as we age.

363
00:15:57.776 --> 00:16:01.422
The ability to look back at a past life.

364
00:16:01.422 --> 00:16:03.872
<v Voiceover>She says it's best to talk to them</v>

365
00:16:03.872 --> 00:16:06.252
before the age of seven.

366
00:16:06.252 --> 00:16:08.713
The recall is still pretty strong when you're

367
00:16:08.713 --> 00:16:10.431
four, five, six years old.

368
00:16:10.431 --> 00:16:14.367
We start being indoctrinated, it starts basically fading.

369
00:16:14.367 --> 00:16:17.104
And with everyone it's different, of course.

370
00:16:17.104 --> 00:16:19.658
And so that makes sense.

371
00:16:19.658 --> 00:16:21.328
<v ->And by the time they're teenagers they're</v>

372
00:16:21.328 --> 00:16:22.439
different animals.

373
00:16:22.439 --> 00:16:25.179
<v Voiceover>Yes, and that's no longer a concern anymore,</v>

374
00:16:25.179 --> 00:16:28.441
we have other more motivating drives by this time.

375
00:16:28.441 --> 00:16:29.750
<v ->Yeah, we have to worry about our current life</v>

376
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:30.513
at that point.

377
00:16:30.513 --> 00:16:32.518
<v Voiceover>Exactly. So I was just wondering about that</v>

378
00:16:32.518 --> 00:16:34.082
because that's something that you mentioned

379
00:16:34.082 --> 00:16:36.346
in the talk last night is this,

380
00:16:36.346 --> 00:16:39.086
which is, again, down the road,

381
00:16:39.086 --> 00:16:40.317
we'll see how this all plays out

382
00:16:40.317 --> 00:16:42.021
together in future generations.

383
00:16:42.021 --> 00:16:44.654
<v ->You know, past lives have always been puzzling for me</v>

384
00:16:44.654 --> 00:16:47.024
because, like I say, it's not a live option for me

385
00:16:47.024 --> 00:16:49.103
because I really wasn't raised to believe it.

386
00:16:49.103 --> 00:16:51.471
On the other hand I have been through

387
00:16:51.471 --> 00:16:53.271
past life regressions.

388
00:16:53.271 --> 00:16:55.299
<v Voiceover>What did that do to you?</v>

389
00:16:55.299 --> 00:16:57.540
<v ->Well the regressions have been fairly succesful.</v>

390
00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:02.436
And that is something that's really never left my head.

391
00:17:02.436 --> 00:17:07.077
And I know at one time Dr. Raymond Moody and I

392
00:17:07.077 --> 00:17:09.721
wrote a book about past life regressions

393
00:17:09.721 --> 00:17:11.915
because we both sat down, we were talking about it one day

394
00:17:11.915 --> 00:17:15.793
and we just got really curious about past lives.

395
00:17:15.793 --> 00:17:18.866
And so Raymond decided, Raymond's a

396
00:17:18.866 --> 00:17:22.663
very good hypnotherapist, and Raymond decided

397
00:17:22.663 --> 00:17:26.297
to do a series of past life regressions.

398
00:17:26.297 --> 00:17:28.381
And we did

399
00:17:29.884 --> 00:17:32.278
I'm going to guess 50, if not more,

400
00:17:32.278 --> 00:17:34.504
regressions with different people.

401
00:17:34.504 --> 00:17:37.882
Almost all of them were very very successful.

402
00:17:37.882 --> 00:17:40.518
And we wrote a book on it called Coming Back.

403
00:17:41.328 --> 00:17:45.623
And our conclusion was that there was a large percentage

404
00:17:45.623 --> 00:17:47.709
of these that were unexplainable.

405
00:17:47.709 --> 00:17:49.694
There were also a percentage of them

406
00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:51.296
that could be explained.

407
00:17:52.026 --> 00:17:55.400
And that there would be unpleasant things

408
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.800
that happened to people and they would,

409
00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:01.366
to deal with the unpleasantness, would kind of reframe it

410
00:18:02.406 --> 00:18:04.710
into maybe into a different era.

411
00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:09.075
And so they could distance themselves from it.

412
00:18:09.075 --> 00:18:12.546
And either way it had therapeutic value.

413
00:18:12.546 --> 00:18:14.880
You know, because you could talk to people

414
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.889
about what was bugging them and maybe it had,

415
00:18:16.889 --> 00:18:19.927
you know, maybe they reframed it from their current life

416
00:18:19.927 --> 00:18:22.110
and you could then deal with it that way.

417
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.420
Or maybe it was actually a past life problem

418
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.825
and you could deal with it that way.

419
00:18:25.825 --> 00:18:28.063
<v Voiceover>Exactly, and I think this all does,</v>

420
00:18:28.063 --> 00:18:32.231
this all, if not now certainly in the near future,

421
00:18:32.231 --> 00:18:35.270
the work with near-death experiences

422
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:38.939
and the wheel of incarnations, past life experiences,

423
00:18:38.939 --> 00:18:41.481
certainly has to be a new way to begin

424
00:18:41.481 --> 00:18:43.548
contending with what we are.

425
00:18:43.548 --> 00:18:46.319
<v ->Well sure, I mean all this stuff is in the same basket.</v>

426
00:18:46.319 --> 00:18:48.421
You know, near- death experiences,

427
00:18:48.421 --> 00:18:51.544
spontaneous out of body experiences, you know,

428
00:18:51.544 --> 00:18:53.819
spontaneous visions of light,

429
00:18:55.169 --> 00:18:56.761
you know you can go on and on.

430
00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:59.431
Past life experiences, they're all in the same basket.

431
00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:01.253
<v Voiceover>Which are profound, I've been taken back</v>

432
00:19:01.253 --> 00:19:02.597
into a number of them myself

433
00:19:02.597 --> 00:19:06.736
and I find each one has had a very unique,

434
00:19:08.966 --> 00:19:12.109
a unique enough understanding that it helps

435
00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:14.338
complete a pixel of the portrait.

436
00:19:14.338 --> 00:19:17.484
I mean, really, it seems to me that this period of history,

437
00:19:17.484 --> 00:19:19.214
that's what this period of history is about.

438
00:19:19.214 --> 00:19:20.953
<v ->Right, and the popular myth,</v>

439
00:19:22.303 --> 00:19:24.940
promulgated probably by Johnny Carson or someone,

440
00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.947
is that people who have past life regressions

441
00:19:27.947 --> 00:19:30.092
always go back and they were Cleopatra

442
00:19:30.092 --> 00:19:32.647
or they were Napoleon or they were, you know...

443
00:19:32.647 --> 00:19:34.400
<v Voiceover>Maybe you were a salesperson.</v>

444
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.929
<v ->That's right, you know, the one thing we didn't run into</v>

445
00:19:37.929 --> 00:19:40.236
was any Napoleons and any Cleopatras.

446
00:19:40.236 --> 00:19:43.101
We ran into people who were ordinary people

447
00:19:43.101 --> 00:19:46.711
in other cultures, maybe middle level bureaucrats,

448
00:19:46.711 --> 00:19:47.605
things like that.

449
00:19:47.605 --> 00:19:50.481
We actually found a couple of people

450
00:19:50.481 --> 00:19:53.244
who were middle level bureaucrats in France

451
00:19:53.244 --> 00:19:57.552
that we were then able to go find that person

452
00:19:57.552 --> 00:19:58.922
in the public record.

453
00:19:58.922 --> 00:20:00.819
<v Voiceover>Oh, interesting, Paul Von Ward is doing</v>

454
00:20:00.819 --> 00:20:03.487
some work on that right now. It's very interesting.

455
00:20:03.487 --> 00:20:05.425
<v ->Yeah, I mean the French and the English of course</v>

456
00:20:05.425 --> 00:20:07.457
are very good record keepers so,

457
00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:11.428
someone says I was, you know, Francois Mitiron,

458
00:20:11.428 --> 00:20:14.969
you know in the year 1720, you're gonna find them

459
00:20:14.969 --> 00:20:17.372
if they were some kind of a bureaucrat.

460
00:20:17.372 --> 00:20:18.974
You will find them.

461
00:20:18.974 --> 00:20:21.041
<v Voiceover>Well, now going back into the</v>

462
00:20:21.041 --> 00:20:24.115
near-death experiences, it's all part of the same wheel.

463
00:20:24.115 --> 00:20:26.517
Another thing that you found the documentary brought up

464
00:20:26.517 --> 00:20:29.304
that was interesting is that you don't necessarily

465
00:20:29.304 --> 00:20:32.415
have to go through the classic near-death experience

466
00:20:32.415 --> 00:20:34.584
through trauma, illness and so forth, but

467
00:20:34.584 --> 00:20:38.426
even when people undergo general anesthetic,

468
00:20:38.426 --> 00:20:41.201
they can have what appears to be

469
00:20:41.201 --> 00:20:43.128
something very similar to that, right?

470
00:20:43.128 --> 00:20:46.066
<v ->Actually what that dealt with was people who are</v>

471
00:20:46.066 --> 00:20:49.638
under general anesthetic and then do have a cardiac arrest.

472
00:20:49.638 --> 00:20:51.612
<v Voiceover>Oh, I see there, they go through that.</v>

473
00:20:51.612 --> 00:20:54.105
<v ->And then they end up having a near-death experience</v>

474
00:20:54.105 --> 00:20:56.206
which is really quite extraordinary.

475
00:20:56.206 --> 00:20:58.807
For anyone who's been under general anesthetic,

476
00:20:58.807 --> 00:21:01.349
you know that it's the sleep of the dead.

477
00:21:01.349 --> 00:21:04.859
And to actually

478
00:21:04.859 --> 00:21:06.891
top that off with death

479
00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:09.720
and then to actually have an experience

480
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.791
where you come out of it...

481
00:21:10.791 --> 00:21:12.458
<v Voiceover>Yeah, because theoretically no one's</v>

482
00:21:12.458 --> 00:21:13.165
home there.

483
00:21:13.165 --> 00:21:14.758
<v ->No one's home. The lights are off.</v>

484
00:21:14.758 --> 00:21:17.823
And that's very, that's enormous.

485
00:21:17.823 --> 00:21:19.727
You know that is enormous.

486
00:21:19.727 --> 00:21:22.955
In fact, the more and more that I look at this,

487
00:21:22.955 --> 00:21:26.237
the more I realize that I've kind of tripped over

488
00:21:26.237 --> 00:21:29.476
from, you know, I'm going to prove

489
00:21:29.476 --> 00:21:31.113
that there's near-death experiences

490
00:21:31.113 --> 00:21:34.213
to, well I'm going to prove that there's not.

491
00:21:34.213 --> 00:21:36.547
Because there's so much evidence, I think,

492
00:21:36.547 --> 00:21:39.554
that shows that near-death experiences exist

493
00:21:39.554 --> 00:21:42.723
and near-death experiences point us in a direction

494
00:21:42.723 --> 00:21:44.323
of an afterlife.

495
00:21:44.323 --> 00:21:46.529
<v Voiceover>When I went under general anesthetic</v>

496
00:21:46.529 --> 00:21:49.060
the first time, I thought I was dead.

497
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.834
When I came out I thought I was somewhere else.

498
00:21:51.834 --> 00:21:55.329
And I asked for a piece of paper with a pencil

499
00:21:55.329 --> 00:21:58.539
and wrote, am I dead? Are we all here

500
00:21:58.539 --> 00:22:01.674
in this place together? Because I couldn't speak yet.

501
00:22:01.674 --> 00:22:04.318
Yeah it does have it's own interesting properties.

502
00:22:04.318 --> 00:22:06.416
<v ->Well it's horrible to think of an ICU as being heaven.</v>

503
00:22:06.416 --> 00:22:09.052
<v Voiceover>Yeah, no, I thought I was in some</v>

504
00:22:09.052 --> 00:22:11.258
strange place as a dead person here.

505
00:22:12.408 --> 00:22:16.357
So let's look at the fact that you've just done Afterlife.

506
00:22:17.637 --> 00:22:21.266
And this DVD, are you having showings?

507
00:22:21.266 --> 00:22:23.332
Or is it mostly going to be available on DVD

508
00:22:23.332 --> 00:22:25.096
or how is this being marketed?

509
00:22:25.096 --> 00:22:27.500
<v ->Well this showing here in Sedona</v>

510
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.808
was the first time I've shown it to an audience at all.

511
00:22:30.808 --> 00:22:32.875
<v Voiceover>And they enjoyed it.</v>

512
00:22:32.875 --> 00:22:34.547
<v ->Thank you very much.</v>

513
00:22:34.547 --> 00:22:36.439
<v Voiceover>Yeah, and some nice effects in there</v>

514
00:22:36.439 --> 00:22:38.552
that I think really stay with you.

515
00:22:38.552 --> 00:22:41.316
So as this comes out in the future

516
00:22:41.316 --> 00:22:43.684
people will be able to go to a website and also find this?

517
00:22:43.684 --> 00:22:46.691
<v ->Yes. They can go to, it's actually,</v>

518
00:22:46.691 --> 00:22:49.454
they can do three or four things.

519
00:22:49.454 --> 00:22:52.388
They can go to paulperryproductions.com,

520
00:22:52.388 --> 00:22:55.319
and they can look at the three films that I've done.

521
00:22:56.319 --> 00:22:58.068
They can go to Amazon and buy it.

522
00:22:58.068 --> 00:23:00.726
They'll be able to go to Barnes and Noble and buy it.

523
00:23:00.726 --> 00:23:02.909
<v Voiceover>Okay, so it will be general distribution.</v>

524
00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:04.206
<v ->Yes, it's being distributed by a company</v>

525
00:23:04.206 --> 00:23:05.642
called Vanguard Cinema

526
00:23:05.642 --> 00:23:08.707
which is a big time distributor in Los Angeles.

527
00:23:08.707 --> 00:23:11.409
<v Voiceover>So that's the filmmaking part of you,</v>

528
00:23:11.409 --> 00:23:14.613
but now I want to know what this journey,

529
00:23:14.613 --> 00:23:18.038
what do you think are the most profound understandings

530
00:23:18.038 --> 00:23:20.793
of your own and implications of what you've learned

531
00:23:20.793 --> 00:23:23.626
since you met Raymond Moody back,

532
00:23:23.626 --> 00:23:25.495
when was that here, 19...

533
00:23:25.495 --> 00:23:28.999
<v ->It was 1987 or something. 23 years ago.</v>

534
00:23:28.999 --> 00:23:31.025
<v Voiceover>Which you didn't believe in any of this stuff.</v>

535
00:23:31.025 --> 00:23:32.300
<v ->I didn't even no about it.</v>

536
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.334
Yeah, I didn't even know about it.

537
00:23:33.334 --> 00:23:35.266
<v Voiceover>So you've coauthored ten books,</v>

538
00:23:35.266 --> 00:23:37.565
you've done documentaries, obviously this has been

539
00:23:37.565 --> 00:23:39.075
your life's work, you have a passion

540
00:23:39.075 --> 00:23:40.561
or you wouldn't have continued this.

541
00:23:40.561 --> 00:23:42.906
So let's talk about the implications, what does

542
00:23:42.906 --> 00:23:44.949
this mean in your mind for humankind

543
00:23:44.949 --> 00:23:47.712
on a number of levels, and you just take it from here.

544
00:23:47.712 --> 00:23:50.081
<v ->Well, I think it is the most</v>

545
00:23:50.081 --> 00:23:53.120
important question of mankind, what happens when we die?

546
00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.186
It's certainly the most pondered.

547
00:23:55.186 --> 00:23:59.494
I'm sure everybody thinks about it daily many times.

548
00:23:59.494 --> 00:24:01.932
You know, what's gonna happen when I'm not here?

549
00:24:01.932 --> 00:24:02.988
What does that mean?

550
00:24:02.988 --> 00:24:04.936
Is it total extinction or what?

551
00:24:04.936 --> 00:24:08.106
And as a journalist I really felt like

552
00:24:08.106 --> 00:24:10.634
it deserved a journalistic treatment.

553
00:24:10.634 --> 00:24:12.909
It deserved someone who was skeptical

554
00:24:12.909 --> 00:24:15.173
because I think being a skeptic is very important.

555
00:24:15.173 --> 00:24:18.317
And skeptical yet inquiring.

556
00:24:18.317 --> 00:24:21.712
And that's been my goal with all of these books

557
00:24:21.712 --> 00:24:25.520
is to just carry on a constant inquiry

558
00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.222
into these experiences.

559
00:24:28.222 --> 00:24:30.683
And to get closer and closer if we can

560
00:24:30.683 --> 00:24:32.053
to answering the question.

561
00:24:32.053 --> 00:24:34.596
I don't have any faith that I'm going to answer

562
00:24:34.596 --> 00:24:36.752
the question any better than Plato did.

563
00:24:37.792 --> 00:24:40.558
As of late I do have faith that Raymond's

564
00:24:40.558 --> 00:24:42.788
going to answer the question better than Plato did.

565
00:24:42.788 --> 00:24:44.488
<v Voiceover>It sounds like it, I'm very excited</v>

566
00:24:44.488 --> 00:24:45.274
about his new work.

567
00:24:45.274 --> 00:24:47.112
<v ->Yeah that's for sure, and Raymond, it's interesting</v>

568
00:24:47.112 --> 00:24:48.606
because Raymond is very much an innovator.

569
00:24:48.606 --> 00:24:52.675
And you know, he essentially

570
00:24:52.675 --> 00:24:55.078
discovered the field of near-death experiences,

571
00:24:55.078 --> 00:24:56.541
of near-death studies.

572
00:24:56.541 --> 00:24:59.020
Because he was the first person to take

573
00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.086
these death experiences, which have happened

574
00:25:02.156 --> 00:25:05.019
to humankind since day one, and to actually

575
00:25:05.019 --> 00:25:07.689
break them up into their component parts.

576
00:25:07.689 --> 00:25:09.860
And that's the near-death experience.

577
00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.438
And that launched the whole field of near-death studies.

578
00:25:12.438 --> 00:25:15.398
But what everyone's thought about up to this point

579
00:25:15.398 --> 00:25:18.371
is, well what everyone has thought about

580
00:25:18.371 --> 00:25:21.645
up to this point is that its' a medical question.

581
00:25:21.645 --> 00:25:25.011
That medical science is going to tell us

582
00:25:25.011 --> 00:25:27.155
whether we survive bodily death or not.

583
00:25:27.155 --> 00:25:28.355
<v Voiceover>They can measure this.</v>

584
00:25:28.355 --> 00:25:30.656
<v ->And what Raymond has finally concluded,</v>

585
00:25:31.796 --> 00:25:34.856
I think he concluded it 20 or 30 years ago

586
00:25:34.856 --> 00:25:37.190
but he's been working on it for 20 or 30 years,

587
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:39.930
is that it's not a medical question at all.

588
00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:43.494
That it's really a question of philosophy and logic.

589
00:25:43.494 --> 00:25:47.836
And that we need, this is a new experience,

590
00:25:47.836 --> 00:25:51.203
we need to look at it in a new way.

591
00:25:51.903 --> 00:25:55.513
And what he's going to do within the framework of his work,

592
00:25:55.513 --> 00:25:57.441
which he'll have to describe himself,

593
00:25:57.441 --> 00:26:00.146
is he's going to provide a new way to look at this.

594
00:26:00.146 --> 00:26:03.420
And the analogy I always use is

595
00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:06.555
one day, a few weeks ago actually,

596
00:26:06.555 --> 00:26:09.654
I was having dinner with Stephen Hawking's daughter

597
00:26:09.654 --> 00:26:13.358
Lucy, and she lives in Arizona and we're having dinner,

598
00:26:13.358 --> 00:26:15.630
we're talking about near-death experiences.

599
00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:18.730
And she said, you know this is very much like

600
00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:22.837
what my father does, this is very much like astrophysics.

601
00:26:23.607 --> 00:26:26.674
Because we have a set of physics

602
00:26:26.674 --> 00:26:29.344
that we live with on Earth,

603
00:26:29.344 --> 00:26:31.446
but once you get out into the universe

604
00:26:31.446 --> 00:26:33.744
there's a whole different set of physics.

605
00:26:35.164 --> 00:26:38.606
And it's only recently that people have realized that.

606
00:26:38.606 --> 00:26:42.890
And even now, they don't have a real language

607
00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:46.152
to deal with many of the things in astrophysics.

608
00:26:46.152 --> 00:26:47.731
And she says that's the same thing

609
00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:49.229
with near-death experiences.

610
00:26:49.229 --> 00:26:52.898
Once you're out of your body, once your consciousness

611
00:26:52.898 --> 00:26:54.906
is out of your body, you're dealing with

612
00:26:54.906 --> 00:26:56.509
a whole new set of physics.

613
00:26:56.509 --> 00:26:58.378
<v Voiceover>Time, space, everything.</v>

614
00:26:58.378 --> 00:26:59.469
<v ->Everything is different.</v>

615
00:26:59.469 --> 00:27:01.443
<v Voiceover>Is altered, different, or not present.</v>

616
00:27:01.443 --> 00:27:03.509
<v ->That's right, and Raymond is going to provide</v>

617
00:27:03.509 --> 00:27:07.480
the framework I'm convinced in which we can work.

618
00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.744
And that'll be a quantum leap.

619
00:27:09.744 --> 00:27:12.588
Plato will stand up and salute him

620
00:27:12.588 --> 00:27:15.758
because this is going to be a quantum leap for this field.

621
00:27:15.758 --> 00:27:17.616
<v Voiceover>I'm very excited about this.</v>

622
00:27:17.616 --> 00:27:18.359
<v ->Me too.</v>

623
00:27:18.359 --> 00:27:20.965
<v Voiceover>Because we need to evolve our minds.</v>

624
00:27:20.965 --> 00:27:23.830
It's not just understand these and give vocabulary to it

625
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:25.594
but we literally need to evolve.

626
00:27:25.594 --> 00:27:27.963
<v ->Well, I mean think of the evolution that would take place</v>

627
00:27:27.963 --> 00:27:31.643
in your mind if all of a sudden you picked up the newspaper

628
00:27:31.643 --> 00:27:35.080
and it said, afterlife is proven. You know?

629
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:37.712
It would change everything.

630
00:27:37.712 --> 00:27:39.849
It would change everything, it would be year zero.

631
00:27:39.849 --> 00:27:42.179
<v Voiceover>Well now I asked that, I asked Raymond that.</v>

632
00:27:42.179 --> 00:27:43.781
Would it change everything?

633
00:27:43.781 --> 00:27:46.126
He said, I don't know, we're still people basically.

634
00:27:46.126 --> 00:27:48.286
How, in your perception, how do you mean

635
00:27:48.286 --> 00:27:49.876
that it would change everything?

636
00:27:49.876 --> 00:27:52.059
If there was the prevailing thought now.

637
00:27:52.059 --> 00:27:55.031
<v ->There would probably still be greed and war,</v>

638
00:27:55.031 --> 00:27:56.893
I'm not so sure that I agree with Raymond

639
00:27:56.893 --> 00:27:58.263
that it wouldn't change that.

640
00:27:58.263 --> 00:28:02.408
I think people would just stop.

641
00:28:03.198 --> 00:28:05.908
I think the world would just stop.

642
00:28:05.908 --> 00:28:07.278
And then it would start again

643
00:28:07.278 --> 00:28:08.810
and it would be a different world.

644
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:10.447
I honestly do believe that.

645
00:28:10.447 --> 00:28:12.886
And I think it would, as Raymond says,

646
00:28:12.886 --> 00:28:16.554
change somehow the structure, and I think he's referring

647
00:28:16.554 --> 00:28:18.772
to the thought structure of the human mind.

648
00:28:18.772 --> 00:28:21.790
And because of that very fact I think it would

649
00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:23.625
just stop the world.

650
00:28:24.915 --> 00:28:27.894
And that would be amazing

651
00:28:27.894 --> 00:28:31.934
because, you know, like the John Lennon song,

652
00:28:31.934 --> 00:28:33.672
what if there was no religion?

653
00:28:35.202 --> 00:28:37.669
What if we didn't live forever, in this case

654
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:39.340
what if we do live forever?

655
00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:41.477
I think people would really, I think

656
00:28:41.477 --> 00:28:43.346
it would just change everything instantly.

657
00:28:45.316 --> 00:28:47.243
<v Voiceover>I don't want to polarize this in terms</v>

658
00:28:47.243 --> 00:28:50.513
of gender, but I noticed in your film,

659
00:28:50.513 --> 00:28:53.021
and I've noticed in other studies as well,

660
00:28:53.021 --> 00:28:56.190
that when you look at the responses of the women

661
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.060
versus the men, there seem to be

662
00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.998
some distinct patterns there.

663
00:28:59.998 --> 00:29:02.100
Where the women seem to, whether they're religious

664
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.629
or not religious, or whether they're new age or

665
00:29:05.629 --> 00:29:09.008
whatever they are, there seems to be a little more

666
00:29:09.008 --> 00:29:12.131
openness to embracing, yeah I think so,

667
00:29:12.131 --> 00:29:14.871
it seems yeah I think there's an afterlife.

668
00:29:14.871 --> 00:29:15.628
<v ->Well of course.</v>

669
00:29:15.628 --> 00:29:17.560
<v Voiceover>There just seems to be a comfort with that</v>

670
00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.637
where the men really have to run it through.

671
00:29:19.637 --> 00:29:22.281
And this is why I think the logic, the development

672
00:29:22.281 --> 00:29:24.557
of the logic and what Raymond is working on

673
00:29:24.557 --> 00:29:27.285
can be really critically important if we can learn to

674
00:29:27.285 --> 00:29:30.220
expand our understanding of

675
00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.229
life in a new way.

676
00:29:32.229 --> 00:29:36.327
<v ->Well testosterone builds walls against the spiritual.</v>

677
00:29:36.327 --> 00:29:39.133
You know, because in many ways

678
00:29:40.153 --> 00:29:42.590
once you become more spiritual, once you start to

679
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.468
face the fact that there's things going on

680
00:29:46.468 --> 00:29:49.115
that you aren't in control of, that there's things

681
00:29:49.115 --> 00:29:50.845
out there that you can't see,

682
00:29:50.845 --> 00:29:52.842
there's feelings you have that

683
00:29:54.542 --> 00:29:56.220
can alter the way you act.

684
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:58.818
A lot of men don't like that.

685
00:29:58.818 --> 00:30:02.356
You know, or a lot of men have to break down walls

686
00:30:02.356 --> 00:30:03.261
to get there.

687
00:30:04.631 --> 00:30:07.356
And so you tend to find men who have had

688
00:30:07.356 --> 00:30:09.759
near-death experiences, I think, to be

689
00:30:09.759 --> 00:30:13.231
way more touchy feely than men who haven't.

690
00:30:13.231 --> 00:30:16.133
Because they've realized, if nothing else,

691
00:30:16.133 --> 00:30:19.674
they've realized that they're not immortal.

692
00:30:19.674 --> 00:30:22.914
You know, they start to realize a certain mortality.

693
00:30:23.864 --> 00:30:26.704
And I know in my own life that illness

694
00:30:28.014 --> 00:30:31.748
really brings out the best in you sometimes.

695
00:30:31.748 --> 00:30:33.347
<v Voiceover>Well you had your own experience.</v>

696
00:30:33.347 --> 00:30:34.673
<v ->I've had my own experience.</v>

697
00:30:34.673 --> 00:30:36.399
<v Voiceover>Can you talk about that a little bit?</v>

698
00:30:36.399 --> 00:30:38.419
<v ->Well, I didn't have a near-death experience.</v>

699
00:30:38.419 --> 00:30:41.392
What happened to me was I had just gotten back

700
00:30:41.392 --> 00:30:43.203
from Madagascar.

701
00:30:43.203 --> 00:30:45.327
This was like 10 years ago and I was there

702
00:30:45.327 --> 00:30:48.741
working on a documentary and a book for Discovery Channel.

703
00:30:48.741 --> 00:30:51.806
And I'm glad it happened here and not in Madagascar,

704
00:30:51.806 --> 00:30:53.640
but I came back and I was taking a hike

705
00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.242
in the desert with my wife

706
00:30:55.242 --> 00:30:58.075
when all of a sudden I had what's known

707
00:30:58.075 --> 00:31:00.618
as left ventricular tachycardia.

708
00:31:00.618 --> 00:31:03.752
You know, my heart just raced and raced and raced

709
00:31:03.752 --> 00:31:05.448
and it wouldn't stop.

710
00:31:05.448 --> 00:31:09.662
And you know, being a testosterone filled male,

711
00:31:09.662 --> 00:31:12.991
I sat down on a rock and then it slowed down

712
00:31:12.991 --> 00:31:14.860
and I said, oh, let's keep going.

713
00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:17.217
So we kept walking and then it would start again.

714
00:31:17.217 --> 00:31:19.666
It was, you know, racing and then slowing down.

715
00:31:19.666 --> 00:31:21.431
And finally I blacked out.

716
00:31:21.431 --> 00:31:26.110
And you know, got back to the car, got to the hospital

717
00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:29.474
and I just had to lay there and wait and wait.

718
00:31:29.474 --> 00:31:31.912
You know, they gave me medications and on an on.

719
00:31:31.912 --> 00:31:36.684
But my feeling at the time was, you know number one,

720
00:31:36.684 --> 00:31:38.222
I could easily be one of the people

721
00:31:38.222 --> 00:31:39.905
I write about in my books.

722
00:31:39.905 --> 00:31:42.552
And number two, I don't want to be one of those people.

723
00:31:42.552 --> 00:31:46.163
You know, because the beauty of a near-death experience

724
00:31:46.163 --> 00:31:48.032
is very well known.

725
00:31:48.032 --> 00:31:51.202
I mean, you see things and you see a reality

726
00:31:51.202 --> 00:31:53.454
that you didn't know possibly existed.

727
00:31:53.454 --> 00:31:55.532
The downside of it is is you have to

728
00:31:55.532 --> 00:31:57.135
almost die to get there.

729
00:31:57.135 --> 00:31:59.236
And almost dying is not pleasant.

730
00:31:59.236 --> 00:32:01.929
And it was a very humbling experience for me.

731
00:32:01.929 --> 00:32:04.577
<v Voiceover>And it does seem to be a story, as you say,</v>

732
00:32:04.577 --> 00:32:07.711
that often times men have to go through a physical crisis

733
00:32:07.711 --> 00:32:10.718
where they can no longer have certainty

734
00:32:10.718 --> 00:32:13.354
that this reality is what they think it is

735
00:32:13.354 --> 00:32:15.060
physically within their body

736
00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:16.930
in order to open to new thought.

737
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:21.399
And, you know, that's, I think what could be really

738
00:32:23.339 --> 00:32:25.634
beautiful about the development

739
00:32:25.634 --> 00:32:29.872
of Raymond's new logic within this context also,

740
00:32:29.872 --> 00:32:31.868
of near-death experience,

741
00:32:31.868 --> 00:32:35.804
is that it can bridge the gap of communication perhaps.

742
00:32:35.804 --> 00:32:38.242
I don't know, I can't quite see it yet

743
00:32:38.242 --> 00:32:39.949
because I don't know what it is yet,

744
00:32:39.949 --> 00:32:41.714
between men and women.

745
00:32:41.714 --> 00:32:44.082
Women, I can say this for myself,

746
00:32:44.082 --> 00:32:47.089
I'm very logical by nature, but I also see

747
00:32:47.089 --> 00:32:48.320
a lot of other things and have had

748
00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.058
a lot of inexplicable experiences

749
00:32:50.058 --> 00:32:51.695
that I'm very comfortable with.

750
00:32:51.695 --> 00:32:54.029
Some of them I don't even have to find logic for

751
00:32:54.029 --> 00:32:55.968
because I have no words for it just yet.

752
00:32:55.968 --> 00:32:59.532
I can explain the experience, but I find still

753
00:32:59.532 --> 00:33:03.236
like most women, I'll become very self conscious,

754
00:33:03.236 --> 00:33:05.291
(coughs) excuse me,

755
00:33:06.121 --> 00:33:08.872
about sharing that with men.

756
00:33:08.872 --> 00:33:11.810
Because immediately, well now, could that have been this,

757
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:12.982
could it have been that, have you

758
00:33:12.982 --> 00:33:14.186
really thought this through?

759
00:33:15.176 --> 00:33:18.015
Look, I know logic too, but this is my experience,

760
00:33:18.015 --> 00:33:20.692
it's not, and it doesn't have that framework

761
00:33:20.692 --> 00:33:22.828
available to explain it fully.

762
00:33:22.828 --> 00:33:24.894
Although, quantum physics is coming into

763
00:33:24.894 --> 00:33:26.427
some interesting areas.

764
00:33:26.427 --> 00:33:29.062
And so perhaps this new logic will allow

765
00:33:29.062 --> 00:33:33.033
that polarity within our own minds and beings

766
00:33:33.033 --> 00:33:36.307
and the polarity in the thinking of the sexes

767
00:33:36.307 --> 00:33:37.828
to come together in a new way

768
00:33:37.828 --> 00:33:41.174
to have a vocabulary to share without either one

769
00:33:41.174 --> 00:33:42.807
having to feel self conscious.

770
00:33:42.807 --> 00:33:45.150
<v ->Yeah, and I think that's true, and I think a lot,</v>

771
00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:49.155
when I say testosterone builds a lot of walls

772
00:33:49.155 --> 00:33:51.582
when it comes to spirituality I really do mean that.

773
00:33:51.582 --> 00:33:55.154
I think there's a real hormonal issue at times,

774
00:33:55.154 --> 00:33:57.360
obviously between men and women.

775
00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.924
And between how men relate to the world.

776
00:34:00.924 --> 00:34:04.102
Would there be less war if women were totally in charge?

777
00:34:04.102 --> 00:34:05.553
I think we're about to find out.

778
00:34:05.553 --> 00:34:09.741
I think more and more women are taking charge in the world.

779
00:34:09.741 --> 00:34:11.808
<v Voiceover>Yeah, well some things brewing right now</v>

780
00:34:11.808 --> 00:34:13.325
are still in the hands of a lot of men.

781
00:34:13.325 --> 00:34:14.312
<v ->Yeah that's right.</v>

782
00:34:14.312 --> 00:34:15.466
<v Voiceover>And that's not good.</v>

783
00:34:15.466 --> 00:34:17.772
<v ->Yeah, yeah, I do feel that way now.</v>

784
00:34:17.772 --> 00:34:19.351
I wouldn't have said that a few years ago

785
00:34:19.351 --> 00:34:21.917
but more and more I've given up on men.

786
00:34:21.917 --> 00:34:25.458
Which is, you know, most women have given up on men

787
00:34:25.458 --> 00:34:27.978
but more and more I've given up on men

788
00:34:27.978 --> 00:34:30.230
because, you know, it would be nice to see

789
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:33.133
some female generals running things.

790
00:34:33.133 --> 00:34:36.325
And to see if they would react in the same way

791
00:34:36.325 --> 00:34:37.730
that the male generals do.

792
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:39.669
<v Voiceover>Well, strategically,</v>

793
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:43.465
what are the considerations? You know? Exactly.

794
00:34:43.465 --> 00:34:46.502
It would be interesting, but in the interim

795
00:34:46.502 --> 00:34:49.404
I think this, like you say, the out of body experience

796
00:34:49.404 --> 00:34:53.386
seems to be a way to go to a higher dialogue

797
00:34:53.386 --> 00:34:54.451
within the being.

798
00:34:54.451 --> 00:34:57.574
And as you have, your people that you have studied,

799
00:34:57.574 --> 00:35:00.918
have said, and also as the people Raymond have studied

800
00:35:00.918 --> 00:35:04.587
came back with this, probably the one significant thing

801
00:35:04.587 --> 00:35:06.990
is the whole notion of love.

802
00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:10.333
<v ->Sure, yeah, I mean people come back with</v>

803
00:35:10.333 --> 00:35:12.772
a whole different view of what love is.

804
00:35:12.772 --> 00:35:15.732
And they tend to be a lot more loving.

805
00:35:15.732 --> 00:35:18.739
I don't know if it ruins CEOs to have

806
00:35:18.739 --> 00:35:20.434
a near-death experience or not.

807
00:35:20.434 --> 00:35:23.139
<v Voiceover>Maybe it would make them a more conscious CEO.</v>

808
00:35:23.139 --> 00:35:24.832
<v ->Well, it would depend on the company, you know.</v>

809
00:35:24.832 --> 00:35:26.814
I think some of the companies might welcome it

810
00:35:26.814 --> 00:35:28.010
and some might not.

811
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:29.914
<v Voiceover>Well, here here. (laughs)</v>

812
00:35:29.914 --> 00:35:31.981
Here here for the near-death experience.

813
00:35:31.981 --> 00:35:34.059
<v ->To do a study like that I'd like to find</v>

814
00:35:34.059 --> 00:35:37.391
five or six CEOs who have had near-death experiences

815
00:35:37.391 --> 00:35:40.398
and see how it effected their approach to business.

816
00:35:40.398 --> 00:35:42.314
I'm sure it has a huge effect on it.

817
00:35:42.314 --> 00:35:44.496
<v Voiceover>Absolutely,</v>
<v ->I'm sure it does.</v>

818
00:35:44.496 --> 00:35:46.435
<v Voiceover>That would be, again, another book.</v>

819
00:35:46.435 --> 00:35:47.573
Fabulous idea.

820
00:35:47.573 --> 00:35:50.603
<v ->And another thing, not to totally rip males,</v>

821
00:35:50.603 --> 00:35:54.280
but you know I've been writing about this now

822
00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.080
for over 20 years.

823
00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.735
And I've seen a real change in how

824
00:35:58.735 --> 00:36:02.077
men relate to near-death experiences

825
00:36:02.077 --> 00:36:05.306
and in how religions relate to near-death experiences.

826
00:36:05.306 --> 00:36:08.720
In the beginning it was the work of the devil, watch out.

827
00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.657
Now I don't really run into that.

828
00:36:11.657 --> 00:36:13.886
I can't tell you when the last time was

829
00:36:13.886 --> 00:36:14.963
that I ran into that.

830
00:36:14.963 --> 00:36:16.782
<v Voiceover>Even in a heavily religious community</v>

831
00:36:16.782 --> 00:36:18.466
for example. That's wonderful.

832
00:36:18.466 --> 00:36:20.043
<v ->Oh, yeah, I don't run into it because</v>

833
00:36:20.043 --> 00:36:22.773
I think over the last 20 years thanks to Raymond's work,

834
00:36:22.773 --> 00:36:26.407
awareness has risen about near-death experiences.

835
00:36:26.407 --> 00:36:27.811
<v Voiceover>And validation.</v>

836
00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:30.517
<v ->People in congregations say, you know, my grandma</v>

837
00:36:30.517 --> 00:36:33.419
had one of those and she's not Satan possessed.

838
00:36:33.419 --> 00:36:37.808
You know, so maybe this is a good thing and not a bad thing.

839
00:36:37.808 --> 00:36:39.723
<v Voiceover>It's a universal.</v>

840
00:36:39.723 --> 00:36:42.495
<v ->And men, because it's become more accepted,</v>

841
00:36:42.495 --> 00:36:46.521
because they know they might have male counterparts

842
00:36:46.521 --> 00:36:48.428
who have had these experiences,

843
00:36:48.428 --> 00:36:51.095
they've certainly had family members who have had them,

844
00:36:51.095 --> 00:36:52.964
they've softened up about them.

845
00:36:52.964 --> 00:36:55.600
I don't get the criticism I used to get.

846
00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.909
And I used to get, you know, kind of severe

847
00:36:58.909 --> 00:37:00.569
oh you're in the woo woo business

848
00:37:00.569 --> 00:37:01.776
and blah blah blah blah blah.

849
00:37:01.776 --> 00:37:05.070
What I do is far far far from woo woo.

850
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:07.648
Believe me, I go out of my way

851
00:37:07.648 --> 00:37:09.749
to keep it from being woo woo.

852
00:37:09.749 --> 00:37:13.022
You know, we try to be

853
00:37:13.022 --> 00:37:15.668
as scientific as we can be

854
00:37:15.668 --> 00:37:16.461
with our work.

855
00:37:16.461 --> 00:37:18.106
<v Voiceover>But you still have some of the good</v>

856
00:37:18.106 --> 00:37:19.794
touchy feely because people like anecdotes.

857
00:37:19.794 --> 00:37:22.762
And in your film you have some people

858
00:37:22.762 --> 00:37:24.295
that share their personal stories

859
00:37:24.295 --> 00:37:26.733
and again, I applaud you for taking the time

860
00:37:26.733 --> 00:37:28.099
to do some animated graphics

861
00:37:28.099 --> 00:37:30.607
that are really quite beautiful to support their words.

862
00:37:30.607 --> 00:37:31.571
<v ->Thank you.</v>

863
00:37:31.571 --> 00:37:33.866
<v Voiceover>And anyone who wants to watch the film</v>

864
00:37:33.866 --> 00:37:37.338
can certainly delve into some of those personal experiences

865
00:37:37.338 --> 00:37:40.577
in watching it, which is lovely, because it

866
00:37:40.577 --> 00:37:44.080
takes it into a realm that we can feel and relate to.

867
00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.107
<v ->Well I thought the people, the people that I had on my,</v>

868
00:37:46.107 --> 00:37:47.955
one of the things that I wanted to do with this film

869
00:37:47.955 --> 00:37:50.723
was to interview people who aren't,

870
00:37:50.723 --> 00:37:53.730
as I say, on the circuit.

871
00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:56.029
You know, they don't go around and they don't

872
00:37:56.029 --> 00:37:58.705
talk professionally or they don't talk

873
00:37:58.705 --> 00:38:01.119
in front of crowds about their near-death experiences.

874
00:38:01.119 --> 00:38:04.672
These are just, for the most part, ordinary people

875
00:38:06.522 --> 00:38:08.780
who have had an extraordinary experience.

876
00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.040
And I purposely sought out people

877
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.910
who aren't on the circuit.

878
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:14.953
And what you see in this film is people

879
00:38:14.953 --> 00:38:17.275
who are very very well spoken

880
00:38:17.275 --> 00:38:19.690
about a very profound experience.

881
00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:21.826
<v Voiceover>Yes. And each one experiencing it just</v>

882
00:38:21.826 --> 00:38:24.496
slightly differently, but again a lot of the common themes.

883
00:38:24.496 --> 00:38:27.863
<v ->Yep, yep, slightly different, but what's neat about it is</v>

884
00:38:27.863 --> 00:38:29.767
is the common theme.

885
00:38:29.767 --> 00:38:33.471
Is that people, you know, they have the same,

886
00:38:33.471 --> 00:38:36.741
they all have the same traits of near-death experiences.

887
00:38:36.741 --> 00:38:39.305
They go up the tunnel, they see dead relatives,

888
00:38:39.305 --> 00:38:40.779
they have a life review.

889
00:38:42.789 --> 00:38:47.420
Sometimes it's so patterned that I'm more interested

890
00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.483
in how they almost died

891
00:38:49.483 --> 00:38:52.571
than I am in their actual near-death experience.

892
00:38:52.571 --> 00:38:54.557
<v Voiceover>And you do a good job of showing that</v>

893
00:38:54.557 --> 00:38:56.563
in the film. It was well done. (laughs)

894
00:38:56.563 --> 00:38:57.654
<v ->Thank you.</v>

895
00:38:57.654 --> 00:38:59.558
<v Voiceover>Oh yeah, the shards of glass in that one,</v>

896
00:38:59.558 --> 00:39:00.623
we'll just leave it at that.

897
00:39:00.623 --> 00:39:02.156
<v ->Shards of glass, yeah that was quite...</v>

898
00:39:02.156 --> 00:39:03.776
And you know what I liked about that is she was

899
00:39:03.776 --> 00:39:06.268
willing to show her scar.

900
00:39:06.268 --> 00:39:08.799
<v Voiceover>Oh God, we could feel that.</v>

901
00:39:08.799 --> 00:39:10.808
<v ->Yeah, it's really quite a stitch job.</v>

902
00:39:10.808 --> 00:39:12.735
<v Voiceover>Created quite a bit of empathy there.</v>

903
00:39:12.735 --> 00:39:13.791
Certainly.

904
00:39:13.791 --> 00:39:15.802
Well now, what are you being compelled toward now,

905
00:39:15.802 --> 00:39:17.637
I mean ten books, are you going to continue?

906
00:39:17.637 --> 00:39:20.513
Like you said, you could go to the Islamic world

907
00:39:20.513 --> 00:39:23.056
and chronicle this even more.

908
00:39:23.056 --> 00:39:24.414
You could go to CEOs.

909
00:39:24.414 --> 00:39:26.887
Are you going to stay on this path of inquiry

910
00:39:26.887 --> 00:39:29.441
or are you being compelled toward an extension of it?

911
00:39:29.441 --> 00:39:30.428
What's up?

912
00:39:30.428 --> 00:39:32.828
<v ->Well I'm not sure, I mean I've spent a lot of time</v>

913
00:39:32.828 --> 00:39:34.129
in the Islamic world.

914
00:39:34.129 --> 00:39:36.729
I spent a lot of time in Saudi Arabia

915
00:39:36.729 --> 00:39:39.365
and I spent a lot of time in Egypt.

916
00:39:39.365 --> 00:39:41.501
I did a film and a book on

917
00:39:42.731 --> 00:39:45.044
the holy family's trip through Egypt.

918
00:39:45.044 --> 00:39:47.807
A trail that they believe, that Muslims

919
00:39:47.807 --> 00:39:51.406
and Christians believe, was taken by the holy family

920
00:39:51.406 --> 00:39:53.342
to get away from King Herod,

921
00:39:53.342 --> 00:39:56.015
which is an account out of the Bible.

922
00:39:56.015 --> 00:39:59.057
And I spent a lot of time around Muslims

923
00:39:59.057 --> 00:40:02.586
and what I have found is is that

924
00:40:02.586 --> 00:40:05.895
they are very willing to talk about experiences like this.

925
00:40:05.895 --> 00:40:09.030
And they have them and they're just as puzzled

926
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:11.062
as westerners are by them.

927
00:40:11.062 --> 00:40:13.001
So, yeah, I would love to do that.

928
00:40:13.001 --> 00:40:14.972
I'd love to do more cross cultural work.

929
00:40:14.972 --> 00:40:17.538
It seems like, you know it seems like

930
00:40:17.538 --> 00:40:20.939
near-death experiences and things associated with them

931
00:40:20.939 --> 00:40:25.815
come up in all the work that I do all over the world.

932
00:40:25.815 --> 00:40:29.083
<v Voiceover>And we need, as a species,</v>

933
00:40:29.083 --> 00:40:32.079
all the bridges we can possibly have to each other

934
00:40:32.079 --> 00:40:33.890
of common experience

935
00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:37.930
in the truest, most infinite themes.

936
00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:40.690
<v ->And it doesn't get much more visceral than that.</v>

937
00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:44.927
When you realize that we're all, it's at the point of death

938
00:40:44.927 --> 00:40:47.900
that many people have the most extraordinary

939
00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:49.606
experience of their life.

940
00:40:49.606 --> 00:40:52.203
And that experience tells us that we're all linked.

941
00:40:52.203 --> 00:40:53.806
<v Voiceover>I hope you do do this book.</v>

942
00:40:53.806 --> 00:40:55.013
<v ->Yeah, I might do that.</v>

943
00:40:55.013 --> 00:40:57.341
<v Voiceover>Until then, any final thoughts?</v>

944
00:40:57.341 --> 00:40:58.975
It's been wonderful chatting with you.

945
00:40:58.975 --> 00:41:00.342
Thank you for producing the film.

946
00:41:00.342 --> 00:41:01.619
<v ->Yeah, thank you very much.</v>

947
00:41:01.619 --> 00:41:03.163
I appreciate it.

948
00:41:04.179 --> 00:41:07.391
<v ->You can go to Paul's website at paulperryproductions.com</v>

949
00:41:07.391 --> 00:41:09.621
to purchase his DVD, Afterlife,

950
00:41:09.621 --> 00:41:12.059
or you can go to Amazon to peruse the wealth of books

951
00:41:12.059 --> 00:41:13.789
he's written on the topic.

952
00:41:13.789 --> 00:41:16.064
Meanwhile, if you haven't already watched our interview

953
00:41:16.064 --> 00:41:18.456
with Dr. Raymond Moody, you might enjoy this as well.

954
00:41:18.456 --> 00:41:21.411
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
