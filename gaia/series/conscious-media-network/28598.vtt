00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.748
<v ->Steven Sisgold learned to listen to his body</v>

2
00:00:02.748 --> 00:00:04.169
at a very early age.

3
00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:06.409
He learned that it always told him the truth,

4
00:00:06.409 --> 00:00:08.268
but why don't the rest of us know this?

5
00:00:08.268 --> 00:00:10.729
He says conditioning from a very early age

6
00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:12.769
has wiped out our ability to listen

7
00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.588
to the essential clues that will guide

8
00:00:14.588 --> 00:00:17.198
our lives in the right direction.

9
00:00:25.799 --> 00:00:27.529
I love what you're doing with this book

10
00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:28.689
because you're...

11
00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.789
What you say in here is that

12
00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.169
those of us in modern culture have become

13
00:00:33.169 --> 00:00:37.768
very disconnected from our body's truth

14
00:00:37.768 --> 00:00:39.849
and what our body is trying to tell us

15
00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:43.139
and I think you're just right on with this work.

16
00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:44.986
What you're saying here is if you want

17
00:00:44.986 --> 00:00:48.048
start releasing the underlying issues that hold us back

18
00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:49.866
and beyond in the joy in life,

19
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.246
we have to start listening to our body

20
00:00:51.246 --> 00:00:53.126
because it knows truth the mind doesn't.

21
00:00:53.126 --> 00:00:55.205
Talk about how you discovered this

22
00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:57.206
and got into this work.

23
00:00:57.206 --> 00:00:58.145
<v ->Thank you.</v>

24
00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:00.246
Well, I could go really early on,

25
00:01:00.246 --> 00:01:02.756
but I'll just start from my professional career.

26
00:01:02.756 --> 00:01:03.425
<v ->Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:03.425 --> 00:01:05.871
<v ->I was working in sales and advertising.</v>

28
00:01:05.871 --> 00:01:08.391
You know what I noticed is no matter what I wrote,

29
00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:10.431
no matter what I would prepare for them

30
00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:12.652
for their presentation, when they would deliver it

31
00:01:12.652 --> 00:01:14.131
I said "Wow, something's off."

32
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:16.351
Their words are saying one thing,

33
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:18.591
but their body's saying something else.

34
00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:20.696
What could that be?

35
00:01:20.696 --> 00:01:22.717
I started noticing wow, they're not breathing

36
00:01:22.717 --> 00:01:24.217
when they're talking about something.

37
00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:27.337
I noticed when you say "This is going to do this"

38
00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:28.877
or "This is going to heal you,"

39
00:01:28.877 --> 00:01:30.737
your body is giving a message.

40
00:01:30.737 --> 00:01:33.737
I started looking into somatic psychology,

41
00:01:33.737 --> 00:01:35.767
body-centered therapy.

42
00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:36.837
What's the difference?

43
00:01:36.837 --> 00:01:41.207
Why is the word and the body, where is the incongruency?

44
00:01:41.207 --> 00:01:44.997
<v ->Okay, now that brings us to a very specific case in point.</v>

45
00:01:44.997 --> 00:01:47.217
I love the example you gave in your book

46
00:01:47.217 --> 00:01:50.017
about a man named Juan, a very talented medical doctor.

47
00:01:50.017 --> 00:01:51.037
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

48
00:01:51.037 --> 00:01:53.495
<v ->This really kind of epitomizes what you're saying there.</v>

49
00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:54.994
Can you tell us about that case?

50
00:01:54.994 --> 00:01:56.115
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

51
00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:58.695
Well, like most of us, we don't feel our bodies.

52
00:01:58.695 --> 00:01:59.874
We're not connected.

53
00:01:59.874 --> 00:02:01.214
For instance, if we were growing up and

54
00:02:01.214 --> 00:02:03.694
we heard something like "Mommy, I want to take

55
00:02:03.694 --> 00:02:05.075
"my sweater off. I'm hot."

56
00:02:05.075 --> 00:02:06.674
Oh, no you're not.

57
00:02:06.674 --> 00:02:09.724
Then, of course, we started to get away from our body

58
00:02:09.724 --> 00:02:11.894
and that's where I came up with this concept,

59
00:02:11.894 --> 00:02:12.975
your billboard.

60
00:02:12.975 --> 00:02:15.355
What's happening in the message you're giving

61
00:02:15.355 --> 00:02:17.354
versus what you think you're giving.

62
00:02:17.354 --> 00:02:20.154
This fellow Juan stands up at a seminar.

63
00:02:20.154 --> 00:02:22.725
He's got an attitude and he says

64
00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:26.214
"I'm a great doctor and I've got six degrees

65
00:02:26.214 --> 00:02:29.295
"and I can really help you and I just said,

66
00:02:29.295 --> 00:02:32.475
just an instinct, I said "How many people in this workshop

67
00:02:32.475 --> 00:02:33.915
would go see Juan?"

68
00:02:33.915 --> 00:02:35.415
No hands went up.

69
00:02:35.415 --> 00:02:37.793
<v ->That must have been just devastating to him</v>

70
00:02:37.793 --> 00:02:38.894
to understand.

71
00:02:38.894 --> 00:02:40.614
<v ->But what feedback for him.
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

72
00:02:40.614 --> 00:02:42.231
<v ->And I kind of sensed what was going on,</v>

73
00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:44.172
but I figured I'd let this thing go a little bit.

74
00:02:44.172 --> 00:02:45.832
I got an instinct that maybe if

75
00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.251
Juan spoke in his native language,

76
00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:50.471
maybe something would shift in his body.

77
00:02:50.471 --> 00:02:53.192
Sure enough, I said "Juan, your native language is Spanish.

78
00:02:53.192 --> 00:02:54.412
"Why don't you speak to the group,

79
00:02:54.412 --> 00:02:56.331
say exactly what you said word for word,

80
00:02:56.331 --> 00:02:58.692
but this time say it in your native language."

81
00:02:58.692 --> 00:03:00.271
All of a sudden a new person appears.

82
00:03:00.271 --> 00:03:03.982
He's like ra-ra-ra-ra, I don't really know Spanish,

83
00:03:03.982 --> 00:03:05.811
but he was just beautiful.

84
00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:07.932
How many people in the room understood

85
00:03:07.932 --> 00:03:09.931
one word that Juan said?

86
00:03:09.931 --> 00:03:11.422
No hands went up.

87
00:03:11.422 --> 00:03:13.261
How many people would go see Juan?

88
00:03:13.261 --> 00:03:14.712
Every hand went up.

89
00:03:14.712 --> 00:03:16.273
(laughing)
<v ->I love this.</v>

90
00:03:16.273 --> 00:03:18.632
<v ->I said "Let's look in your body, Juan"</v>

91
00:03:18.632 --> 00:03:22.002
Because the mind, Albert Einstein says this great quote.

92
00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:24.592
"You can't solve a problem with

93
00:03:24.592 --> 00:03:26.882
"the same thinking that created it."

94
00:03:26.882 --> 00:03:30.632
I'd taken that into "Okay, if he's stuck in a thought,

95
00:03:30.632 --> 00:03:32.712
"he obviously has some thought about himself

96
00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:35.012
"in relationship to others."

97
00:03:35.012 --> 00:03:37.922
Let's go into another consciousness, the whole body.

98
00:03:38.482 --> 00:03:41.271
Juan speaks in Spanish and I asked him, I said

99
00:03:41.271 --> 00:03:43.252
"Now, what was the difference there?

100
00:03:43.252 --> 00:03:46.011
"It looked like you were relaxed, your body changed."

101
00:03:47.131 --> 00:03:49.112
As we tuned it he said, "Well, the difference is

102
00:03:49.112 --> 00:03:51.982
"when I was speaking to them in

103
00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:55.092
"what wasn't my native tongue, a lot of anger came up"

104
00:03:55.092 --> 00:03:56.771
as he started tuning in his body.

105
00:03:56.771 --> 00:03:59.372
"I'm upset, you know, I was a really famous doctor

106
00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:01.471
"back in my home country and then I come here

107
00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:03.252
"and I'm struggling."

108
00:04:03.252 --> 00:04:05.054
Oh, so you have some chips on your shoulder.

109
00:04:05.054 --> 00:04:06.771
Well Juan, guess what?

110
00:04:06.771 --> 00:04:08.331
No matter what you say to people,

111
00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:10.431
your body is saying don't come to me,

112
00:04:10.431 --> 00:04:12.971
I'm angry, so that really shifted him.

113
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:13.991
You could see it in his body.

114
00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:15.211
He's like "Oh wow."

115
00:04:15.211 --> 00:04:16.611
I said, "Yeah, you have a belief in there that

116
00:04:16.611 --> 00:04:20.461
"in America, I have to tell about my six degrees,

117
00:04:20.461 --> 00:04:22.031
"I need to get it across."

118
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:24.071
<v ->Wasn't his body language very closed with his arms</v>

119
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:26.911
folded across his chest?
<v ->Closed and just tough guy</v>

120
00:04:26.911 --> 00:04:28.631
and basically what he was doing is

121
00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:30.291
he had a belief in there that said

122
00:04:30.291 --> 00:04:34.791
in order to be really successful in this country,

123
00:04:34.791 --> 00:04:38.231
I need to go up a little bit and tell people how great I am.

124
00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:40.591
No Juan, what we felt was your heart.

125
00:04:40.591 --> 00:04:42.171
When you spoke in your native language,

126
00:04:42.171 --> 00:04:43.591
you dropped all that.

127
00:04:43.591 --> 00:04:46.421
That belief that was in his mind in English

128
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:48.791
went away when his body could communicate.

129
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:51.161
That's the congruency I think we're looking for.

130
00:04:51.801 --> 00:04:54.734
<v ->With the rest of us, with most people, we learn,</v>

131
00:04:54.734 --> 00:04:57.591
like you said that example of the sweater in the car.

132
00:04:57.591 --> 00:04:58.680
No. you're not hot, honey.

133
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.720
Put that back on and the child's back there sweating

134
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.830
in the backseat, so we learn to invalidate our own feelings

135
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.920
to please others which turns into, as time goes on,

136
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.740
out and out lies.

137
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.610
We start lying to ourselves.

138
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.620
Talk about how you see this normally in people

139
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.689
and what happens to our ability to connect with ourselves.

140
00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:20.809
<v ->Thank you.
<v Voiceover>By which ages?</v>

141
00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:23.349
<v ->Well, I think early on, like I said, we do learn</v>

142
00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.469
that if we speak our truth sometimes,

143
00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:27.799
like I had a call last week.

144
00:05:28.299 --> 00:05:31.197
The wife says "Every time my husband

145
00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:32.977
"puts our child in the bathtub, he goes Daddy,

146
00:05:32.977 --> 00:05:34.297
"it's too hot, it's too hot."

147
00:05:34.297 --> 00:05:36.947
It does not. It hurts. No it doesn't.

148
00:05:36.947 --> 00:05:39.187
That child early on is learning

149
00:05:39.187 --> 00:05:40.606
"I don't know what's in my body.

150
00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:42.365
"Maybe I don't know what I feel."

151
00:05:42.365 --> 00:05:45.165
Then as time goes on that happens where

152
00:05:45.165 --> 00:05:46.765
we'll express ourselves.

153
00:05:46.765 --> 00:05:49.705
Like for instance, you might say "Hey, I'm noticing this"

154
00:05:49.705 --> 00:05:52.105
or "I'm feeling that" and you're told no

155
00:05:52.105 --> 00:05:54.365
because maybe somebody got uncomfortable.

156
00:05:54.365 --> 00:05:56.405
Maybe it was too much for somebody.

157
00:05:56.405 --> 00:05:58.865
Then we learn to do this.
(inhales)

158
00:05:58.865 --> 00:06:01.065
We'll hold our breath and enroll our body

159
00:06:01.065 --> 00:06:03.305
to hold onto that unexpressed truth,

160
00:06:03.305 --> 00:06:04.825
that unexpressed feeling.

161
00:06:04.825 --> 00:06:06.088
What happens is, the body starts to

162
00:06:06.088 --> 00:06:08.403
get into that rhythmic pattern of

163
00:06:08.403 --> 00:06:10.863
I want to tell truth, but the last time I did

164
00:06:10.863 --> 00:06:12.803
I got punished or I got shamed

165
00:06:12.803 --> 00:06:14.223
or I was told no.

166
00:06:14.223 --> 00:06:16.323
What happened is I got into a pattern of

167
00:06:16.323 --> 00:06:18.363
(inhales) I want to tell my truth but instead

168
00:06:18.363 --> 00:06:19.803
I'm going to grit it in my jaw.

169
00:06:19.803 --> 00:06:21.243
I'm going to hold it in my body

170
00:06:21.243 --> 00:06:22.643
and then where does it go?

171
00:06:22.643 --> 00:06:23.523
Where does that energy go?

172
00:06:23.523 --> 00:06:25.383
It stays there and it can cause havoc.

173
00:06:25.383 --> 00:06:27.123
I have many examples of where people have

174
00:06:27.123 --> 00:06:31.713
held in and then got asthma or arthritis or tension

175
00:06:31.713 --> 00:06:34.883
and it's that belief that lives embedded in the cells.

176
00:06:36.123 --> 00:06:40.243
<v ->It's not as though our current way of living is</v>

177
00:06:40.243 --> 00:06:42.513
helping it any because we've become,

178
00:06:42.513 --> 00:06:44.963
at least when we were young you would go out

179
00:06:44.963 --> 00:06:46.683
in the field and play and a lot of your time

180
00:06:46.683 --> 00:06:49.073
you spent away from other influences.

181
00:06:49.073 --> 00:06:51.452
Your influences were your peers, other kids,

182
00:06:51.452 --> 00:06:54.492
where someone might step on your toe or bop you on the head

183
00:06:54.492 --> 00:06:57.272
if they were angry with you and you learned how to

184
00:06:57.272 --> 00:07:00.392
work with each other in that way.

185
00:07:00.392 --> 00:07:01.832
But it's very different now.

186
00:07:01.832 --> 00:07:03.472
With children, for example, you're in a very

187
00:07:03.472 --> 00:07:06.312
controlled environment that's driven by technology.

188
00:07:06.312 --> 00:07:11.242
What is technology, having this access to a virtual world,

189
00:07:11.242 --> 00:07:14.432
done to further, I assume, disconnect us

190
00:07:14.432 --> 00:07:16.132
from the physical knowledge?

191
00:07:16.132 --> 00:07:17.194
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

192
00:07:17.194 --> 00:07:20.095
The first story that comes to mind is a simple one.

193
00:07:20.095 --> 00:07:23.202
Friend of mine takes the kids to the beach.

194
00:07:23.202 --> 00:07:25.272
Look at the waves, look at the sand.

195
00:07:25.272 --> 00:07:27.692
He's so excited to get to go out and play.

196
00:07:27.692 --> 00:07:29.992
They arrive at the beach and the kids say

197
00:07:29.992 --> 00:07:31.972
"Daddy. we want to stay in the van

198
00:07:31.972 --> 00:07:33.842
"and play with our Gameboys."

199
00:07:33.842 --> 00:07:36.591
Imagine that, they're so fixated.

200
00:07:36.591 --> 00:07:38.591
No, I think there's tremendous technology.

201
00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:40.051
We can learn so much,

202
00:07:40.051 --> 00:07:43.001
but what happened is we've gotten so

203
00:07:43.841 --> 00:07:45.760
connected to going to the screen

204
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.240
and then going into this virtual and that

205
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.260
and we've become more internal.

206
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.920
In fact, there's more shut-ins, more people

207
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.040
are staying in, they're shopping through the internet.

208
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.780
They're not getting out and exercising and moving.

209
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.920
<v ->Teenage boys in Japan,</v>

210
00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.380
this has become an epidemic, shut-in teenage boys.

211
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.820
They're terrified to go out and interface with girls

212
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.040
and with the public.

213
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.840
They live virtual world completely.

214
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.570
Parents bring them food.

215
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.200
There was an epidemic of this a few years ago.

216
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.519
<v ->Yeah, I think what's happened is we really need</v>

217
00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:15.779
to get back into our bodies and the first thing

218
00:08:15.779 --> 00:08:19.879
I say to people is just imagine you're driving.

219
00:08:20.499 --> 00:08:22.059
You're gripping the wheel.

220
00:08:22.059 --> 00:08:24.579
Your shoulders are up to your ears.

221
00:08:24.579 --> 00:08:27.399
You're thinking about something that happened that morning

222
00:08:27.399 --> 00:08:29.659
and you get to work and you say "I don't know why,

223
00:08:29.659 --> 00:08:33.469
"but I have the worst neckache and I have no idea why."

224
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:36.741
That's an example of how much of an epidemic it is,

225
00:08:36.741 --> 00:08:39.279
that we're actually not even aware

226
00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:40.699
that we're gripping the wheel.

227
00:08:40.699 --> 00:08:42.659
I could be sitting here right now gripping the chair,

228
00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.699
if I didn't know, how would I look int the interview?

229
00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:48.489
It's just a matter of being more aware of

230
00:08:48.489 --> 00:08:50.098
what is my breathing.

231
00:08:50.718 --> 00:08:52.619
How am I sitting?

232
00:08:52.619 --> 00:08:54.059
What's going on for me?

233
00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:56.899
Not only releases stress, but it will communicate more,

234
00:08:56.899 --> 00:08:59.579
like I said early, congruent message because I know

235
00:08:59.579 --> 00:09:01.039
what's going on in here.

236
00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:03.929
I'm a whole body speaking, not just the mind.

237
00:09:03.929 --> 00:09:05.409
<v ->Yes.</v>

238
00:09:05.409 --> 00:09:09.179
Yet, at the same time, we're at this crossroads

239
00:09:09.179 --> 00:09:12.979
of exploration on a religious level,

240
00:09:12.979 --> 00:09:14.929
on a spiritual level,

241
00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:17.829
and a lot of the,

242
00:09:17.837 --> 00:09:19.587
for lack of a better word I'll say it,

243
00:09:19.587 --> 00:09:21.285
a lot of the new-aged concepts, even a lot of the

244
00:09:21.285 --> 00:09:25.545
Eastern religious concepts, very often will

245
00:09:25.545 --> 00:09:28.224
separate us from our bodies and say

246
00:09:28.224 --> 00:09:30.674
you are not your body.

247
00:09:30.674 --> 00:09:32.825
Who you are transcends the body.

248
00:09:32.825 --> 00:09:35.445
It's almost become desirable, in certain ways,

249
00:09:35.445 --> 00:09:38.825
to begin exploring being out of the body even more.

250
00:09:38.825 --> 00:09:40.265
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

251
00:09:40.265 --> 00:09:42.652
Two things, one is obviously we watch TV.

252
00:09:42.652 --> 00:09:46.112
We're told don't feel, take a pill, do this and that.

253
00:09:46.112 --> 00:09:47.772
But you know I have a piece in my book

254
00:09:47.772 --> 00:09:52.082
about how did we get into this I am not my body.

255
00:09:52.082 --> 00:09:54.312
A lot of spiritual teachings, people took that as

256
00:09:54.312 --> 00:09:55.871
"Oh, I am not my body."

257
00:09:55.871 --> 00:09:58.512
I take it as "No, you're more than a body."

258
00:09:58.512 --> 00:10:01.091
I have a little story in there about Hidayat Anayat Khan,

259
00:10:01.091 --> 00:10:03.731
head of the Sufi Order, and he was saying to me one day,

260
00:10:03.731 --> 00:10:05.592
we did a workshop together and we were at

261
00:10:05.592 --> 00:10:07.712
the Grand Waialei Hotel and he walks in and he goes

262
00:10:07.712 --> 00:10:09.821
"This is the most beautiful place.

263
00:10:09.821 --> 00:10:10.892
"Oh my knee hurts."

264
00:10:10.892 --> 00:10:13.832
He says to me, he says, "What do they mean in the Sufi

265
00:10:13.832 --> 00:10:15.632
"that I am not my body?

266
00:10:15.632 --> 00:10:16.712
"I am totally my body.

267
00:10:16.712 --> 00:10:18.972
"I'm enjoying this hotel and my knee hurts."

268
00:10:18.972 --> 00:10:20.191
I said "Exactly."

269
00:10:20.191 --> 00:10:22.152
We can celebrate spirituality.

270
00:10:22.152 --> 00:10:24.992
You go to a gospel service, people are celebrating

271
00:10:24.992 --> 00:10:27.332
spirituality from head to toe.

272
00:10:27.332 --> 00:10:31.052
I believe I am my body and I'm more than my body,

273
00:10:31.052 --> 00:10:33.852
but to try to get out of the body to transcend

274
00:10:33.852 --> 00:10:36.652
I think is a mixed message that people have got.

275
00:10:36.652 --> 00:10:41.201
<v ->Yes, and also intuition as we know it</v>

276
00:10:41.201 --> 00:10:43.861
often comes directly from the body.

277
00:10:43.861 --> 00:10:47.581
We're looking at moving beyond, moving our faculties beyond

278
00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:50.181
the physical realms to be able to grok information

279
00:10:50.181 --> 00:10:52.824
beyond time and space and all this sort of thing

280
00:10:52.824 --> 00:10:55.160
that most of us are capable of doing,

281
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.341
even if we don't know it yet.

282
00:10:56.341 --> 00:10:57.700
We're capable of doing that,

283
00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.381
but a lot of time that information is actually being

284
00:11:00.381 --> 00:11:03.811
sensed and brought to us through the body.

285
00:11:03.811 --> 00:11:06.030
Isn't that true?
<v Steven>Absolutely.</v>

286
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.149
<v ->Oh my gosh, how many times.</v>

287
00:11:07.149 --> 00:11:08.209
<v ->That's how I experience it.</v>

288
00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:10.449
<v ->Oh absolutely, you know, we get caught in,</v>

289
00:11:10.449 --> 00:11:12.469
what I calll, spin trap.

290
00:11:12.469 --> 00:11:15.888
We have one thought, it continues, it continues.

291
00:11:15.888 --> 00:11:17.978
A rock star came to me and he said

292
00:11:17.978 --> 00:11:20.166
"You know what, I can't write.

293
00:11:20.166 --> 00:11:22.607
"What happened? I want to write another hit."

294
00:11:23.495 --> 00:11:24.615
What have you been thinking?

295
00:11:24.615 --> 00:11:26.076
I've been thinking I want to write another hit.

296
00:11:26.076 --> 00:11:27.056
I want to write another hit.

297
00:11:27.056 --> 00:11:28.945
What's wrong, what's wrong with me?

298
00:11:29.555 --> 00:11:31.936
The title of the book, What's Your Body Telling You,

299
00:11:31.936 --> 00:11:33.615
that's all the question I need to ask.

300
00:11:33.615 --> 00:11:35.115
What's your body telling you?

301
00:11:35.115 --> 00:11:38.016
Say out loud what you want, and this is great for viewers,

302
00:11:38.016 --> 00:11:40.116
say out loud something that you want.

303
00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:41.715
I want to write another hit record.

304
00:11:41.715 --> 00:11:43.575
Whoo, I noticed some feelings in my body.

305
00:11:43.575 --> 00:11:44.416
Thank you.

306
00:11:44.416 --> 00:11:46.556
You've made that integrative conversation now.

307
00:11:46.556 --> 00:11:48.926
You're not just up here thinking and spinning.

308
00:11:48.926 --> 00:11:50.516
You're now listening to both.

309
00:11:50.516 --> 00:11:52.725
What is your body telling you?

310
00:11:52.725 --> 00:11:54.056
I'm feeling some fear.

311
00:11:54.056 --> 00:11:57.896
Okay, I want to write a hit record, I feel fear in my chest.

312
00:11:57.896 --> 00:12:00.556
Put your hand on there, take a couple breaths

313
00:12:01.296 --> 00:12:03.388
and listen and he goes

314
00:12:03.388 --> 00:12:06.256
"Oh my gosh, I'm having," what we would call

315
00:12:06.256 --> 00:12:08.275
cellular memory or body memory.

316
00:12:08.275 --> 00:12:09.856
"The last time I wrote a hit,

317
00:12:09.856 --> 00:12:11.796
my brother got jealous and cut me off

318
00:12:11.796 --> 00:12:14.606
and my parents said so you think you're a big shot now."

319
00:12:15.476 --> 00:12:17.955
You have a belief that lives in your chest that says

320
00:12:17.955 --> 00:12:20.836
if I write another hit, I'm going to lose my family.

321
00:12:20.836 --> 00:12:22.416
He goes, "Oh, I think that's it."

322
00:12:22.416 --> 00:12:25.896
All of a sudden, he expands,

323
00:12:25.896 --> 00:12:30.132
he breathes and I say "Try this."

324
00:12:30.132 --> 00:12:33.108
As I write another hit, my family's going to

325
00:12:33.108 --> 00:12:34.748
love me even more

326
00:12:34.748 --> 00:12:36.228
and he starts to up open.

327
00:12:36.228 --> 00:12:40.178
I hand him a guitar, we write a song on the spot.

328
00:12:40.178 --> 00:12:43.778
That year he got a Grammy and was on the Oscars.

329
00:12:43.778 --> 00:12:46.368
I use that not to say look at me, look at him,

330
00:12:46.368 --> 00:12:50.078
but every one of us has those moments where we think

331
00:12:50.078 --> 00:12:52.228
I say separate the fact from the fiction.

332
00:12:52.228 --> 00:12:55.748
The fact is you're scared your family's going to lose you.

333
00:12:55.748 --> 00:12:57.308
The fiction is if I write another hit,

334
00:12:57.308 --> 00:12:58.708
I'm going to lose my family.

335
00:12:58.708 --> 00:13:00.248
See, we go into that thought

336
00:13:00.248 --> 00:13:01.968
and we let the fiction take over.

337
00:13:01.968 --> 00:13:06.088
The body always tells us the fact, tells us the truth.

338
00:13:06.088 --> 00:13:08.587
I'm afraid; it's okay to be afraid.

339
00:13:08.587 --> 00:13:09.728
<v ->That's a good point.</v>

340
00:13:09.728 --> 00:13:12.878
Just because you have fear surrounding something

341
00:13:12.878 --> 00:13:15.948
doesn't mean that it has to stop you either.

342
00:13:15.948 --> 00:13:17.990
I want to talk about that.

343
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:19.708
Let's back track for just a moment, though,

344
00:13:19.708 --> 00:13:22.588
where we were just before that question which was

345
00:13:22.588 --> 00:13:26.287
you said people don't want to feel.

346
00:13:26.287 --> 00:13:28.008
They've been told it's not okay to feel.

347
00:13:28.008 --> 00:13:29.348
Take a pill.

348
00:13:29.348 --> 00:13:32.178
We have half the country drugged

349
00:13:32.178 --> 00:13:34.068
out of feeling anything.

350
00:13:34.068 --> 00:13:36.748
Now, can you, does this techinique

351
00:13:36.748 --> 00:13:39.350
work with people who literally have been

352
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:40.928
drugged out of feeling who are on

353
00:13:40.928 --> 00:13:44.268
every kind of anti-depressant and sleeping aid

354
00:13:44.268 --> 00:13:46.198
and so forth out there?

355
00:13:47.218 --> 00:13:48.088
Can this still work?

356
00:13:48.088 --> 00:13:50.088
Can you still access yourself through this haze of

357
00:13:50.088 --> 00:13:52.688
all these mood altering drugs?

358
00:13:52.688 --> 00:13:54.808
<v ->A very important question, by the way,</v>

359
00:13:54.808 --> 00:13:57.068
because a lot of people are, as you said, drugged.

360
00:13:57.068 --> 00:13:57.748
<v ->Yeah.</v>

361
00:13:57.748 --> 00:14:00.968
<v ->But what I notice is no matter what state wer're in,</v>

362
00:14:00.968 --> 00:14:02.148
we can always take a breath.

363
00:14:02.148 --> 00:14:06.468
Just starting with that, to be able to take a deep breath,

364
00:14:06.468 --> 00:14:08.728
usually will start to get the engine rolling.

365
00:14:08.728 --> 00:14:10.888
People will say I'm a little out of the fog.

366
00:14:10.888 --> 00:14:13.247
Someone's feeling numbed.

367
00:14:14.157 --> 00:14:16.044
Let's face it, who wants to be uncomfortable?

368
00:14:16.044 --> 00:14:18.563
I understand totally, discomfort in the body,

369
00:14:18.563 --> 00:14:19.864
I want to get out, right?

370
00:14:19.864 --> 00:14:21.764
Something happened to us when we're young,

371
00:14:21.764 --> 00:14:23.824
doesn't feel good, we want to get out.

372
00:14:23.824 --> 00:14:27.364
No matter what pills or method we're using

373
00:14:27.364 --> 00:14:30.994
to get out of the body, the body is so intelligent.

374
00:14:30.994 --> 00:14:32.504
It's been there since day one.

375
00:14:32.504 --> 00:14:35.824
I call it the library of our flesh, my own personal Google.

376
00:14:35.824 --> 00:14:39.104
I can go in there any time and even if I've been

377
00:14:39.104 --> 00:14:41.364
on anti-depressants, which I've worked with a lot of people

378
00:14:41.364 --> 00:14:44.844
on those drugs, simply once they start to breathe

379
00:14:44.844 --> 00:14:47.504
and get the engine moving, there's some connection

380
00:14:47.504 --> 00:14:50.583
that happens, it starts to wake up that intelligence.

381
00:14:50.583 --> 00:14:52.384
Then they start the feel a little tingle.

382
00:14:52.384 --> 00:14:54.014
They might not feel as much as someone

383
00:14:54.014 --> 00:14:56.904
that's not drugged or medicated,

384
00:14:56.904 --> 00:14:59.204
but I really believe the body is so strong

385
00:14:59.204 --> 00:15:01.514
that it can kind of push through that veil a little bit

386
00:15:01.514 --> 00:15:02.924
and get some feeling going.

387
00:15:02.924 --> 00:15:05.604
Then from there, I just encourage them to express

388
00:15:05.604 --> 00:15:07.704
because most of those drugs will cut off

389
00:15:07.704 --> 00:15:09.363
that expression feeling, which is good

390
00:15:09.363 --> 00:15:10.584
for people that are going up and down

391
00:15:10.584 --> 00:15:14.234
and they're going whew, it's nice to be a neutral zone.

392
00:15:14.234 --> 00:15:16.724
But that doesn't mean that we still can't breathe.

393
00:15:16.724 --> 00:15:19.184
Doesn't mean that we still can't breathe and tell the truth

394
00:15:19.184 --> 00:15:22.464
and move through even that drug-induced state.

395
00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:25.084
<v ->Well yeah, good, I just wanted to get that on the table</v>

396
00:15:25.084 --> 00:15:27.084
for anyone who's thinking "Well, I'd like to do this,

397
00:15:27.084 --> 00:15:30.814
"but I'm taking these drugs" for example.

398
00:15:30.814 --> 00:15:31.904
That's good to know.

399
00:15:31.904 --> 00:15:33.344
Let's go back to the fear

400
00:15:33.344 --> 00:15:36.464
and the notion of moving through the fear.

401
00:15:37.914 --> 00:15:40.564
As you mentioned with the rock star,

402
00:15:40.564 --> 00:15:42.764
there might have been some fear there

403
00:15:42.764 --> 00:15:45.144
that the family that still is residing, didn't get

404
00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:48.004
immediately displaced, but it doesn't mean

405
00:15:48.004 --> 00:15:49.244
that you don't move forward.

406
00:15:49.244 --> 00:15:50.664
How does that work together?

407
00:15:50.664 --> 00:15:52.464
<v ->Well first, well I don't believe</v>

408
00:15:52.464 --> 00:15:54.064
we necessarily get rid of things.

409
00:15:54.064 --> 00:15:54.904
I've never believed that.

410
00:15:54.904 --> 00:15:57.544
I think if we can loosen the grip, if we can notice

411
00:15:57.544 --> 00:16:00.544
when it comes up, for instance it may come up for him

412
00:16:00.544 --> 00:16:02.204
every time he goes to write a record,

413
00:16:02.204 --> 00:16:04.524
but the difference is now he's aware.

414
00:16:04.524 --> 00:16:07.764
Oh, that was then, now and now.

415
00:16:07.764 --> 00:16:09.784
If my older brother slapped me on the back of the neck

416
00:16:09.784 --> 00:16:12.704
20 times a day, you come over to me gently

417
00:16:12.704 --> 00:16:15.044
and put your hand on my neck and go like this,

418
00:16:15.044 --> 00:16:16.414
what was that?

419
00:16:16.414 --> 00:16:18.824
If I'm not aware of it, I'm going to keep going like that

420
00:16:18.824 --> 00:16:21.764
and maybe get mad at you and say "Don't touch me that way."

421
00:16:21.764 --> 00:16:24.604
Once I get in touch with it, i can actually breath into it

422
00:16:24.604 --> 00:16:28.124
and go "Well that was then, now is now."

423
00:16:28.124 --> 00:16:31.714
I can actually separate the past from the present

424
00:16:31.714 --> 00:16:33.504
and what's fact and what's fiction.

425
00:16:33.504 --> 00:16:34.924
I think that's the first step.

426
00:16:34.924 --> 00:16:36.894
There's so much fear out there now

427
00:16:36.894 --> 00:16:39.044
and people call me, this guy calls me, he says

428
00:16:39.044 --> 00:16:42.415
"You know, I heard through the grapevine

429
00:16:42.415 --> 00:16:44.164
"that they're downsizing my company."

430
00:16:44.164 --> 00:16:45.835
Okay, take a breath.

431
00:16:45.835 --> 00:16:46.924
"I'm going to lose my job.

432
00:16:46.924 --> 00:16:49.404
"I'm going to lose medical coverage.

433
00:16:49.404 --> 00:16:50.494
"I'm never going to work again."

434
00:16:50.494 --> 00:16:51.564
I went, whoa.

435
00:16:51.564 --> 00:16:55.464
That's step one, separate the fact from the fiction.

436
00:16:55.464 --> 00:16:57.405
The fact is you heard about downsizing.

437
00:16:57.405 --> 00:16:59.705
The fact is you're afraid and where

438
00:16:59.705 --> 00:17:01.285
do you feel it in your body.

439
00:17:01.285 --> 00:17:03.305
Anything else is fiction.

440
00:17:03.305 --> 00:17:04.945
He starts to breathe through that and he goes

441
00:17:04.945 --> 00:17:07.944
"Wow, thanks. I've started to disentangle the fear

442
00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:09.544
"from the desire."

443
00:17:09.544 --> 00:17:12.074
I always say to people, you can dive afraid.

444
00:17:12.074 --> 00:17:13.964
You climb up a diving board.

445
00:17:13.964 --> 00:17:16.525
I'm afraid, but I really want to jump in the quarry.

446
00:17:16.525 --> 00:17:18.824
I've always wanted to jump in there.

447
00:17:18.824 --> 00:17:20.165
Okay.

448
00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:23.084
I want to dive and I'm afraid.

449
00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:24.314
Dive afraid.

450
00:17:24.724 --> 00:17:27.467
Take that fear and embody it and still go for it.

451
00:17:27.467 --> 00:17:28.467
What does he do?

452
00:17:28.467 --> 00:17:30.367
He makes a new resume that day.

453
00:17:30.367 --> 00:17:33.057
He walks across the street to a competitor

454
00:17:33.057 --> 00:17:34.897
and he walks in and they say "Nope.

455
00:17:34.897 --> 00:17:38.067
"No entry without appointment."

456
00:17:38.067 --> 00:17:39.136
He says, okay.

457
00:17:39.136 --> 00:17:41.476
He breathes and says "No, I'm going to go out of the box."

458
00:17:41.476 --> 00:17:45.596
He goes down to the mail room, goes up the elevator,

459
00:17:45.596 --> 00:17:48.816
walks into personal and they said. "No, no appointments."

460
00:17:48.816 --> 00:17:50.645
"If you don't have an appointment, you can't get in."

461
00:17:50.645 --> 00:17:52.195
One of the partners was walking by and says

462
00:17:52.195 --> 00:17:55.076
"I like this guy, he's got some kahaunas there.

463
00:17:55.076 --> 00:17:56.895
"Let's bring him in."

464
00:17:56.895 --> 00:17:59.336
We really, once we separate the fact from the fiction

465
00:17:59.336 --> 00:18:01.596
and breathe, and actually feel what it is,

466
00:18:01.596 --> 00:18:03.956
kind of shake it out, then I say to people

467
00:18:03.956 --> 00:18:05.675
take your fear and use it.

468
00:18:05.675 --> 00:18:08.655
Get innovative, dive afraid, just keep going for it.

469
00:18:08.655 --> 00:18:10.196
You can breathe through the fear.

470
00:18:10.196 --> 00:18:12.806
Not necessarily going to go away, but when it comes up

471
00:18:12.806 --> 00:18:14.236
you now have a choice point.

472
00:18:14.236 --> 00:18:15.316
You don't have to get frozen in it.

473
00:18:15.316 --> 00:18:17.316
You can move through it.

474
00:18:17.316 --> 00:18:18.876
<v ->The bogey man is what we don't know</v>

475
00:18:18.876 --> 00:18:20.216
that's hidden in there and that's what

476
00:18:20.216 --> 00:18:22.236
your body will reveal to you.

477
00:18:22.236 --> 00:18:24.176
The other case you just talked about is

478
00:18:24.176 --> 00:18:27.016
future projections of what might happen

479
00:18:27.016 --> 00:18:29.256
which is a different kind of a bogey man.

480
00:18:29.256 --> 00:18:32.296
We're conjuring that with our own minds and fear mechanisms,

481
00:18:32.296 --> 00:18:35.236
maybe some exposure to situations in the past.

482
00:18:35.236 --> 00:18:37.716
You're saying once the body can then share

483
00:18:37.716 --> 00:18:41.526
this information with you, reveal to you what that

484
00:18:41.526 --> 00:18:44.126
feeling is that's inspiring fear,

485
00:18:44.126 --> 00:18:47.516
then it's in essence freeing us to be able to

486
00:18:47.516 --> 00:18:48.995
move into new realms?

487
00:18:48.995 --> 00:18:51.175
<v ->Absolutely, I can give you my own example.</v>

488
00:18:51.175 --> 00:18:52.476
The first time I was on television,

489
00:18:52.476 --> 00:18:54.676
I'm a very confident guy, I couldn't wait.

490
00:18:54.676 --> 00:18:55.976
I'm sitting in the green room.

491
00:18:55.976 --> 00:18:58.485
"Steve Sisgold, you're on in five minutes."

492
00:18:58.485 --> 00:19:01.966
All of a sudden, this anxiety rolls through my body.

493
00:19:01.966 --> 00:19:03.456
I'm totally nervous.

494
00:19:03.456 --> 00:19:05.995
"Steve Sisgold, you're on in three minutes."

495
00:19:05.995 --> 00:19:07.666
Okay.

496
00:19:07.666 --> 00:19:09.376
I start to breathe because my mind was saying

497
00:19:09.376 --> 00:19:11.215
oh god, I'm nervous.

498
00:19:11.215 --> 00:19:14.056
I start to breathe and I notice one of those body memories.

499
00:19:14.056 --> 00:19:17.030
As I touch into my body, I notice "Oh yeah,

500
00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.905
"the first time I left my neighborhood, I got beat up."

501
00:19:19.905 --> 00:19:21.345
Somewhere in me says

502
00:19:21.345 --> 00:19:24.256
moving out into new territory is unsafe.

503
00:19:24.256 --> 00:19:26.516
Because like you said, I had that awareness,

504
00:19:26.516 --> 00:19:28.576
I was able to breathe and go oh,

505
00:19:28.576 --> 00:19:29.935
that's that little boy speaking.

506
00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:32.295
There he is, he's visiting again.

507
00:19:32.295 --> 00:19:35.176
I am going to go out on the TV and be safe.

508
00:19:35.176 --> 00:19:36.516
My body didn't believe it.

509
00:19:36.516 --> 00:19:39.105
I had two minutes left, so for two minutes

510
00:19:39.105 --> 00:19:41.916
I shook it, I breathe it, and finally I felt it.

511
00:19:41.916 --> 00:19:43.956
Ah, that was then, now is now.

512
00:19:43.956 --> 00:19:46.596
I walked on the set, how are you, I'm doing great.

513
00:19:46.596 --> 00:19:49.396
You can see that choice is always there for us.

514
00:19:49.396 --> 00:19:51.116
We can always recreate that moment,

515
00:19:51.116 --> 00:19:53.816
but I think accessing it in the library

516
00:19:53.816 --> 00:19:55.415
is the place to start.

517
00:19:55.415 --> 00:19:58.666
<v ->You write about, to further on that,</v>

518
00:19:58.666 --> 00:20:03.666
that when we lose touch with that natural intelligence,

519
00:20:03.666 --> 00:20:05.775
which is our guidance system which is like

520
00:20:05.775 --> 00:20:10.196
a bird without their magnetic connection to the earth,

521
00:20:10.196 --> 00:20:12.175
when we lose that we lose our confidence.

522
00:20:12.175 --> 00:20:14.856
Is it any surprise that people are running around

523
00:20:14.856 --> 00:20:17.536
looking to everyone outside of themselves

524
00:20:17.536 --> 00:20:19.365
to tell them what to do?

525
00:20:19.365 --> 00:20:20.255
What to do with their lives?

526
00:20:20.255 --> 00:20:21.785
Should I make this decision?

527
00:20:21.785 --> 00:20:24.976
Anywhere from psychologists to psychics to priests,

528
00:20:24.976 --> 00:20:26.116
it doesn't really matter who,

529
00:20:26.116 --> 00:20:28.095
running to the outside to make decisions

530
00:20:28.095 --> 00:20:30.915
because we don't have that confidence anymore?

531
00:20:30.915 --> 00:20:32.136
Can you talk about that a bit?

532
00:20:32.136 --> 00:20:33.995
<v ->Absolutely, I think it's great to have coaches</v>

533
00:20:33.995 --> 00:20:37.386
and mentors, but one of my techniques is called SET,

534
00:20:37.386 --> 00:20:38.956
self evident truth.

535
00:20:38.956 --> 00:20:41.475
Because, as I said earlier, I think most of us have been

536
00:20:41.475 --> 00:20:43.556
discouraged to feel our truth and many times

537
00:20:43.556 --> 00:20:47.165
when we said our truth, we were told no, that's not right.

538
00:20:47.165 --> 00:20:49.636
I think the first thing is how can I get self-reliant

539
00:20:49.636 --> 00:20:51.976
and start to tap in to what I know.

540
00:20:51.976 --> 00:20:54.156
The reason I call it self evident truth,

541
00:20:54.156 --> 00:20:56.155
if in this moment I'm sweating,

542
00:20:56.155 --> 00:20:58.595
you can tell me I'm not, "Oh, it's cool in here.

543
00:20:58.595 --> 00:21:00.066
"You're not sweating."

544
00:21:00.066 --> 00:21:01.705
No, actually I am.

545
00:21:01.705 --> 00:21:04.195
It's a good start to breathe and detect

546
00:21:04.195 --> 00:21:06.935
from head to toe what am I noticing?

547
00:21:06.935 --> 00:21:08.055
What am I feeling?

548
00:21:08.055 --> 00:21:09.236
That's the beginning.

549
00:21:09.236 --> 00:21:11.606
From there, I start to build confidence that

550
00:21:11.606 --> 00:21:13.856
oh, when I feel that hunch in my belly,

551
00:21:13.856 --> 00:21:17.126
when I feel that instinct, maybe it's actually

552
00:21:17.126 --> 00:21:19.296
something I can listen to because now I have that

553
00:21:19.296 --> 00:21:22.055
integrative, as I said earlier, conversation going

554
00:21:22.055 --> 00:21:23.836
mind and body.

555
00:21:23.836 --> 00:21:26.636
I think it's important for us to find small steps

556
00:21:26.636 --> 00:21:29.576
and simple techniques to start to access.

557
00:21:29.576 --> 00:21:31.056
I say to people when I'm with them,

558
00:21:31.056 --> 00:21:33.076
maybe last night it was a good example.

559
00:21:33.076 --> 00:21:36.136
I did a bookstore presentation and the person in charge

560
00:21:36.136 --> 00:21:37.916
kept noticing how she didn't breathe.

561
00:21:37.916 --> 00:21:39.836
At last ten times in that evening I said

562
00:21:39.836 --> 00:21:41.175
"Are you breathing now."

563
00:21:41.175 --> 00:21:42.796
Check out your self evident truth

564
00:21:42.796 --> 00:21:46.836
and she went "Oh, I noticed" so that's the beginning

565
00:21:46.836 --> 00:21:50.056
of someone starting to become a little more self-reliant.

566
00:21:50.056 --> 00:21:52.526
I'm able to tune in and feel what I feel

567
00:21:52.526 --> 00:21:55.156
and I know it and no one outside can tell me.

568
00:21:55.156 --> 00:21:58.536
<v ->That is the recovering of our own sovereignty or automony</v>

569
00:21:58.536 --> 00:22:00.805
<v ->Exactly.
<v Voiceover>which does</v>

570
00:22:00.805 --> 00:22:03.656
help us develop our own of faith in ourselves again.

571
00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:04.816
I mean, that's what's really lost.

572
00:22:04.816 --> 00:22:08.576
It's not so much, people say "Oh, humanity has lost faith."

573
00:22:08.576 --> 00:22:11.536
Well, what we've lost faith in is ourselves,

574
00:22:11.536 --> 00:22:15.835
even more so than structures and each other.

575
00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:18.066
It's ourselves.

576
00:22:18.066 --> 00:22:20.975
I've noticed this even when it comes to selecting

577
00:22:20.975 --> 00:22:24.346
an interviewee for our conscious meeting network.

578
00:22:24.346 --> 00:22:27.005
For me, it's always a body experience.

579
00:22:27.005 --> 00:22:30.816
I see something or I see someone's face and I either

580
00:22:30.816 --> 00:22:32.636
open and think "Yeah."

581
00:22:32.636 --> 00:22:33.715
I don't know this person, I don't know

582
00:22:33.715 --> 00:22:35.875
what they're doing yet even, but I want to find out.

583
00:22:35.875 --> 00:22:38.586
Or I know this person's really famous and I should do this,

584
00:22:38.586 --> 00:22:41.255
but it doesn't feel good to me.

585
00:22:41.255 --> 00:22:43.525
I go with that,

586
00:22:43.525 --> 00:22:45.914
even in a case like that,

587
00:22:45.914 --> 00:22:48.504
and I find that it usually serves very well.

588
00:22:48.504 --> 00:22:50.825
We don't have to know why, it doesn't have to make sense,

589
00:22:50.825 --> 00:22:52.567
does it, to our logical mind?

590
00:22:52.567 --> 00:22:54.626
<v ->Not at all, but you trust your instincts.</v>

591
00:22:54.626 --> 00:22:55.967
so I want to ask you a question.

592
00:22:55.967 --> 00:22:57.647
How did you get to trust your instincts?

593
00:22:57.647 --> 00:23:00.676
Why do you, that takes a lot of courage first of all,

594
00:23:00.676 --> 00:23:04.206
when you could have a famous person, but your body says no.

595
00:23:04.206 --> 00:23:06.306
When we meet someone that looks so great,

596
00:23:06.306 --> 00:23:08.627
but our body says I don't know if I want to enter into this.

597
00:23:08.627 --> 00:23:10.306
Wow, sounds like a great investment,

598
00:23:10.306 --> 00:23:11.969
but my body's saying no.

599
00:23:11.969 --> 00:23:13.466
I'd just like to ask you,

600
00:23:13.466 --> 00:23:16.507
how and why do you listen to that instinct

601
00:23:16.507 --> 00:23:18.086
because I think that's the answer?

602
00:23:18.086 --> 00:23:22.057
You had courage and say "No, I'm going to trust this."

603
00:23:22.057 --> 00:23:24.627
<v ->Yes, it's been a process.</v>

604
00:23:24.627 --> 00:23:28.446
I think in my earlier years, in my 20s, I would let

605
00:23:28.446 --> 00:23:33.166
other people kind of influence or even bully me

606
00:23:33.166 --> 00:23:35.547
into something that I didn't want to do

607
00:23:35.547 --> 00:23:37.586
or out of something that I did want to do

608
00:23:37.586 --> 00:23:40.626
and I would notice after the fact, as I moved through life

609
00:23:40.626 --> 00:23:43.176
a little bit more, that my original ideas

610
00:23:43.176 --> 00:23:44.406
and thoughts on it were correct.

611
00:23:44.406 --> 00:23:46.066
I might even go back on something I'd been

612
00:23:46.066 --> 00:23:49.947
intimidated out of doing and try it anyway after the fact

613
00:23:49.947 --> 00:23:52.246
and find out "My gosh, I did great at this.

614
00:23:52.246 --> 00:23:54.036
"It worked just fine."

615
00:23:54.036 --> 00:23:56.266
It was a process of learning to develop

616
00:23:56.266 --> 00:23:58.446
faith in myself through trial and error

617
00:23:58.446 --> 00:24:00.186
and through understanding what it was like

618
00:24:00.186 --> 00:24:04.016
to be shut down from the outside

619
00:24:04.016 --> 00:24:06.792
and find out that that was not correct for me.

620
00:24:06.792 --> 00:24:08.342
I should have gone ahead.

621
00:24:08.342 --> 00:24:11.602
I think learned probably a good 20 years ago or so,

622
00:24:11.602 --> 00:24:13.842
but also I listen to my body on that.

623
00:24:13.842 --> 00:24:15.672
For me, it's in the stomach.

624
00:24:15.672 --> 00:24:17.562
If someone shuts my stomach down and makes it

625
00:24:17.562 --> 00:24:19.252
feel in a knot, I don't care who they are,

626
00:24:19.252 --> 00:24:21.445
I don't want anything to do with it.

627
00:24:21.445 --> 00:24:22.862
I don't have to know why.

628
00:24:22.862 --> 00:24:25.362
It could be a million things.

629
00:24:25.362 --> 00:24:27.622
It may not have anything to do with them personally even,

630
00:24:27.622 --> 00:24:29.492
I don't make it personal.

631
00:24:29.492 --> 00:24:30.982
Maybe the timing's not right.

632
00:24:30.982 --> 00:24:32.542
Maybe I'm thinking "yes, let's do this"

633
00:24:32.542 --> 00:24:34.502
but it turns out they're going to moving

634
00:24:34.502 --> 00:24:37.312
out of the country in a week and I'm not aware of it yet.

635
00:24:37.312 --> 00:24:39.322
It doesn't really matter, I'm getting the information

636
00:24:39.322 --> 00:24:42.022
and it usually serves pretty well.

637
00:24:42.022 --> 00:24:43.212
<v ->You see, you're answer is</v>

638
00:24:43.212 --> 00:24:45.442
exactly what I was hoping you would say

639
00:24:45.442 --> 00:24:48.362
because what I'm hearing is you provided some evidence

640
00:24:48.362 --> 00:24:49.562
by testing it out.

641
00:24:49.562 --> 00:24:51.822
In other words, you trusted an instinct

642
00:24:51.822 --> 00:24:53.982
and then you had evidence of like wow,

643
00:24:53.982 --> 00:24:56.861
or you didn't trust an instinct and you had evidence of like

644
00:24:56.861 --> 00:24:59.042
wow, what would have happened if I would have listened.

645
00:24:59.042 --> 00:25:00.642
I think that's so beautiful because

646
00:25:00.642 --> 00:25:02.862
our body was there from day one.

647
00:25:02.862 --> 00:25:05.862
For instance, when anything happens, I acknowledge that

648
00:25:05.862 --> 00:25:08.382
and go wow, maybe my mind can get to it.

649
00:25:08.382 --> 00:25:10.122
I like to look at like a submarine.

650
00:25:10.122 --> 00:25:13.192
I say "Inside are these feelings and these memories."

651
00:25:14.032 --> 00:25:15.623
The eight-year-old who says "Oh boy,

652
00:25:15.623 --> 00:25:18.572
the first time I leave the neighborhood isn't safe."

653
00:25:18.572 --> 00:25:21.382
I have become the periscope.

654
00:25:21.382 --> 00:25:22.844
You can't see in the submarine,

655
00:25:22.844 --> 00:25:24.782
so most people don't know why they're feeling

656
00:25:24.782 --> 00:25:28.002
what they're feeling, but I'm that periscope that says

657
00:25:28.002 --> 00:25:31.112
"Hey, there's an instinct and I'm looking out here.

658
00:25:31.112 --> 00:25:33.562
"You're safe. It's okay to go on that TV show.

659
00:25:33.562 --> 00:25:36.542
"You'll be safe" or "There's an instinct.

660
00:25:36.542 --> 00:25:38.101
"Remember last time when you didn't

661
00:25:38.101 --> 00:25:39.522
"follow that instinct."

662
00:25:39.522 --> 00:25:40.922
I think you're a really good example of

663
00:25:40.922 --> 00:25:43.872
you've learned to trust, you've taken some chances

664
00:25:43.872 --> 00:25:45.702
or you didn't take chances and then you've got

665
00:25:45.702 --> 00:25:47.542
the evidence of like this works.

666
00:25:47.542 --> 00:25:48.992
That's exactly what I'm teaching.

667
00:25:48.992 --> 00:25:50.142
<v ->Then it's instantaneous.</v>

668
00:25:50.142 --> 00:25:52.712
Then you just say "Mm, yeah" or "Mm-mm, no."

669
00:25:52.712 --> 00:25:56.242
It's instant, for me now anyway it's instant.

670
00:25:56.242 --> 00:25:58.662
I very seldom have to actually sit and think about

671
00:25:58.662 --> 00:26:00.142
and debate anything.
<v Steven>It becomes a</v>

672
00:26:00.142 --> 00:26:02.142
natural reaction.
<v Voiceover>Oh yeah.</v>

673
00:26:02.142 --> 00:26:03.142
<v ->I'll say yes to buying
<v Steven>becomes a response.</v>

674
00:26:03.142 --> 00:26:04.342
<v ->a house in two seconds,
<v Steven>You get that</v>

675
00:26:04.342 --> 00:26:05.179
<v Steven>connection,</v>
<v Voiceover>but I can't make</v>

676
00:26:05.179 --> 00:26:07.277
my mind up on whether or not I'd like to have

677
00:26:07.277 --> 00:26:09.656
a chia latte or a cup of tea.

678
00:26:09.656 --> 00:26:10.877
(laughing)

679
00:26:10.877 --> 00:26:12.537
It's the little things in life, but the big things

680
00:26:12.537 --> 00:26:15.807
I know instantly, the things that are really impactful.

681
00:26:15.807 --> 00:26:18.176
Let's talk about that enthusiasm because you talk about

682
00:26:18.176 --> 00:26:21.316
something in the book where yes, I love little kids.

683
00:26:21.316 --> 00:26:24.527
Yes, I want to be dancer, I want to be a singer,

684
00:26:24.527 --> 00:26:26.617
but something happens that starts

685
00:26:26.617 --> 00:26:29.576
robbing us of our enthusiasm as we go along

686
00:26:29.576 --> 00:26:32.076
and once that's dampened, that really changes the course

687
00:26:32.076 --> 00:26:34.797
of the decisions we make and our potentials

688
00:26:34.797 --> 00:26:38.197
in terms of our own success, however we define that.

689
00:26:38.197 --> 00:26:41.517
<v ->Absolutely, I think every one of us, again, at times</v>

690
00:26:41.517 --> 00:26:45.106
had enthusiasm or wanted to say something.

691
00:26:45.106 --> 00:26:48.336
I look at it as like an upward and downward energy.

692
00:26:48.336 --> 00:26:50.417
For instance, I want to do this.

693
00:26:50.417 --> 00:26:52.407
I'm excited about that.

694
00:26:52.407 --> 00:26:55.126
My energy goes up, as you probably just noticed.

695
00:26:55.126 --> 00:26:58.697
How long will it take, one second, two seconds, two hours,

696
00:26:58.697 --> 00:27:01.517
before my energy goes down and says

697
00:27:01.517 --> 00:27:03.517
"Oh, but nobody will buy it"?

698
00:27:03.517 --> 00:27:06.247
I want to write a new song, oh but nobody's

699
00:27:06.247 --> 00:27:08.099
going to want to hear it.

700
00:27:08.099 --> 00:27:09.618
<v ->I think everybody can relate to this.</v>

701
00:27:09.618 --> 00:27:11.798
<v ->Yeah, I call it "the I want but"</v>

702
00:27:11.798 --> 00:27:14.758
because we have the I want, the desire and the energy

703
00:27:14.758 --> 00:27:18.119
goes up, but what happens is we hit a threshold.

704
00:27:18.119 --> 00:27:20.859
Our body can only hold so much energy.

705
00:27:20.859 --> 00:27:24.158
Not only with oh gee, I can only hold so much stress

706
00:27:24.158 --> 00:27:27.199
until I'm going to blow my top, but imagine the opposite.

707
00:27:27.199 --> 00:27:30.199
I think like 65% of the people who won the lottery

708
00:27:30.199 --> 00:27:32.848
in California, when they used to give one check

709
00:27:32.848 --> 00:27:36.068
versus 20 checks, lost that money back.

710
00:27:36.068 --> 00:27:37.159
And here's why.

711
00:27:37.159 --> 00:27:39.239
I want to be rich, I'm tired of being poor.

712
00:27:39.239 --> 00:27:40.259
I want to be rich.

713
00:27:40.259 --> 00:27:42.088
Here's a million dollars.

714
00:27:42.828 --> 00:27:44.838
I'm not used to it, my body can't take it.

715
00:27:44.838 --> 00:27:46.678
If you're not breathing and moving and expressing,

716
00:27:46.678 --> 00:27:48.679
what happens is the body wants to go back

717
00:27:48.679 --> 00:27:51.399
to the familiar contracted place

718
00:27:51.399 --> 00:27:53.478
and they found a way to lose the money.

719
00:27:53.478 --> 00:27:55.558
Why, because it was more familiar to walk around

720
00:27:55.558 --> 00:27:58.069
and go I'm upset with the economy.

721
00:27:58.069 --> 00:27:59.819
I want more money.

722
00:27:59.819 --> 00:28:02.639
They went back to the familiar and as children,

723
00:28:02.639 --> 00:28:05.429
if we're told I'm great.

724
00:28:05.429 --> 00:28:06.919
I have a little story in there about a kid,

725
00:28:06.919 --> 00:28:08.739
I'm a great artist, I'm a great artist.

726
00:28:08.739 --> 00:28:11.498
He takes his drawings to school and the teacher says

727
00:28:11.498 --> 00:28:13.399
"You did not draw this,"

728
00:28:13.399 --> 00:28:14.769
"No, I really did."

729
00:28:14.769 --> 00:28:17.388
"You did not, you're a liar. Sit in the corner."

730
00:28:17.388 --> 00:28:18.959
Threw away his pencils.

731
00:28:18.959 --> 00:28:20.539
<v ->Well, that will shut down the artist in him.</v>

732
00:28:20.539 --> 00:28:23.228
<v ->Threw away his pencils for like 30, 40 years</v>

733
00:28:23.228 --> 00:28:25.769
because somewhere in there he learned

734
00:28:25.769 --> 00:28:28.119
my art makes people think I'm a liar

735
00:28:28.119 --> 00:28:31.659
or I had enthusiasm and somebody dampered it

736
00:28:31.659 --> 00:28:33.679
and it just takes one person, unfortunately.

737
00:28:33.679 --> 00:28:36.409
I was a little league coach and I saw the kids get up to bat

738
00:28:36.409 --> 00:28:38.501
and the other coach who was afraid to lose would say

739
00:28:38.501 --> 00:28:40.439
"He's no good, he'll be a strike out."

740
00:28:40.439 --> 00:28:41.679
I'd run over to the other coach and go

741
00:28:41.679 --> 00:28:43.299
"You know, that guy might in therapy because

742
00:28:43.299 --> 00:28:45.549
of that one thing you said."

743
00:28:45.549 --> 00:28:47.598
He had enthusiasm when he got up to bat

744
00:28:47.598 --> 00:28:49.879
and you knocked it down.

745
00:28:49.879 --> 00:28:52.039
<v ->Isn't that one of the worst things as human beings</v>

746
00:28:52.039 --> 00:28:53.359
we can do to each other?

747
00:28:53.359 --> 00:28:54.519
<v ->I really believe so.
<v Voiceover>Is steal</v>

748
00:28:54.519 --> 00:28:57.619
the enthusiasm of another person, to dampen it?

749
00:28:57.619 --> 00:28:59.658
<v ->Yeah, and you know what's sad?</v>

750
00:28:59.658 --> 00:29:02.199
We're only doing it because it's uncomfortable.

751
00:29:02.199 --> 00:29:04.619
Somebody's enthusiastic, it makes us jealous.

752
00:29:04.619 --> 00:29:07.359
Somebody's enthusiastic, it brings up our lack

753
00:29:07.359 --> 00:29:09.709
and rather than saying what I teach,

754
00:29:09.709 --> 00:29:11.579
go into the body and say when you said that,

755
00:29:11.579 --> 00:29:12.899
I got scared.

756
00:29:12.899 --> 00:29:14.599
When you said that, I felt jealous.

757
00:29:14.599 --> 00:29:19.599
Instead, let me hold you down so I can feel better

758
00:29:19.679 --> 00:29:21.259
and that's really a sad case because

759
00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:22.888
if we would feel better, we wouldn't need

760
00:29:22.888 --> 00:29:24.534
to hold anybody else down.

761
00:29:24.534 --> 00:29:26.903
<v ->Very true and we all lose it</v>

762
00:29:26.903 --> 00:29:27.974
from time to time.

763
00:29:27.974 --> 00:29:30.354
We all feel these feelings from time to time,

764
00:29:30.354 --> 00:29:33.834
on one level, part of the scale, or another.

765
00:29:33.834 --> 00:29:35.034
This is very good that you're saying

766
00:29:35.034 --> 00:29:36.484
we have to look at it

767
00:29:36.484 --> 00:29:39.434
and listen to our body head on on this.

768
00:29:39.434 --> 00:29:42.764
Otherwise, that is our destiny.

769
00:29:43.824 --> 00:29:47.054
If we steal the enthusiasm of others,

770
00:29:47.054 --> 00:29:49.714
we're destined to do it to ourselves, ultimately, aren't we?

771
00:29:49.714 --> 00:29:52.494
<v ->Absolutely because it becomes a habit.</v>

772
00:29:52.494 --> 00:29:54.674
Rather than going in and really feeling,

773
00:29:54.674 --> 00:29:57.514
if we could just get to the place, even in a relationship

774
00:29:57.514 --> 00:30:02.514
of any kind, and say wow, when I saw you on stage

775
00:30:02.783 --> 00:30:05.094
I got jealous, I've had that happen to me.

776
00:30:05.094 --> 00:30:07.454
I've had people say to me in the middle of my talk,

777
00:30:07.454 --> 00:30:10.473
I was giving a talk, I said "And anyway, l love this quote,

778
00:30:10.473 --> 00:30:12.314
Ghandi, your life is you message," and this guy

779
00:30:12.314 --> 00:30:14.454
raises his hand and he says,

780
00:30:14.454 --> 00:30:15.333
"Are you going to tell me people

781
00:30:15.333 --> 00:30:17.504
"Ghandi cheated on his wife?"

782
00:30:17.504 --> 00:30:20.334
I said "I don't know about that but no, that wasn't my plan.

783
00:30:20.334 --> 00:30:22.594
"I was just using the quote to get across that

784
00:30:22.594 --> 00:30:24.464
"what you broadcast, how you live,

785
00:30:24.464 --> 00:30:26.544
"is a message to the world."

786
00:30:26.544 --> 00:30:28.193
I took a deep breath and I said

787
00:30:28.193 --> 00:30:29.434
"What's going on for you?

788
00:30:29.434 --> 00:30:31.093
"Is it your purpose to bring up

789
00:30:31.093 --> 00:30:32.854
"the negative part of Ghandi?"

790
00:30:32.854 --> 00:30:33.633
No.

791
00:30:33.633 --> 00:30:35.573
Well, would you be willing to just breathe

792
00:30:35.573 --> 00:30:37.393
and find out why you interrupted me?

793
00:30:37.393 --> 00:30:38.994
I'm okay that you did, but I'd like to know.

794
00:30:38.994 --> 00:30:42.114
He says "I think I wanted to be on that stage

795
00:30:42.114 --> 00:30:43.993
"giving this lecture and not you."

796
00:30:43.993 --> 00:30:45.494
Thank you.

797
00:30:45.494 --> 00:30:48.134
There was an example of someone who was jealous,

798
00:30:48.134 --> 00:30:50.294
didn't get in touch with that in his body,

799
00:30:50.294 --> 00:30:52.993
and he tried to damper me, tried to keep me down

800
00:30:52.993 --> 00:30:55.703
and all I did was say what's up.

801
00:30:55.703 --> 00:30:57.874
Feel into your body, what's happening for you.

802
00:30:58.694 --> 00:31:02.294
<v ->Let's talk about something that everybody has</v>

803
00:31:02.294 --> 00:31:05.434
in their, almost everybody walking the face of Earth has

804
00:31:05.434 --> 00:31:08.994
and maybe go over a technique has to how we deal with this,

805
00:31:08.994 --> 00:31:11.514
and that is that negative self chat.

806
00:31:11.514 --> 00:31:13.774
In this case, he was projecting it at you

807
00:31:13.774 --> 00:31:15.414
or he was projecting it at Ghandi,

808
00:31:15.414 --> 00:31:17.474
but the reality is the harshest critic

809
00:31:17.474 --> 00:31:19.214
of each of us is usually ourselves.

810
00:31:19.214 --> 00:31:21.054
We have those old tapes running.

811
00:31:21.054 --> 00:31:23.153
Let's say anyone watching this right now can

812
00:31:23.153 --> 00:31:25.734
probably access pretty quickly a tape of

813
00:31:25.734 --> 00:31:28.074
critical nature of themselves or others

814
00:31:28.074 --> 00:31:30.254
going on somewhere in the background,

815
00:31:30.254 --> 00:31:32.014
how do we begin working with this?

816
00:31:32.014 --> 00:31:34.194
We can't do the whole book because we don't have time

817
00:31:34.194 --> 00:31:35.953
and people have to pick up a copy,

818
00:31:35.953 --> 00:31:37.774
but let's just kind of go this direction.

819
00:31:37.774 --> 00:31:40.074
<v ->My instruction would be this.</v>

820
00:31:40.074 --> 00:31:42.854
First of all, say out loud what you want

821
00:31:42.854 --> 00:31:46.094
and then listen to your body, whatever it is.

822
00:31:46.094 --> 00:31:49.334
Let's say you're having low self-esteem about your body

823
00:31:49.334 --> 00:31:51.074
or your weight, so forth.

824
00:31:51.074 --> 00:31:53.574
Say out loud what you want.

825
00:31:53.574 --> 00:31:55.764
I want to lose 30 pounds.

826
00:31:55.764 --> 00:31:58.054
I want to exercise more and be fit.

827
00:31:58.054 --> 00:32:01.194
Then listen, really take a moment and listen.

828
00:32:01.194 --> 00:32:02.934
What is my body telling me?

829
00:32:02.934 --> 00:32:05.474
What's happening in here that's against

830
00:32:05.474 --> 00:32:07.494
that wish, that desire?

831
00:32:07.494 --> 00:32:10.704
What'll happen is if you say, for instance, a fellow said

832
00:32:10.704 --> 00:32:13.213
I want to have, could even get it out,

833
00:32:13.213 --> 00:32:15.154
I want to have a success.

834
00:32:15.154 --> 00:32:17.053
Okay, you want to have a what?

835
00:32:17.053 --> 00:32:20.383
I want to have a successful medical practice.

836
00:32:20.383 --> 00:32:22.754
Thank you, what did you notice in your body?

837
00:32:22.754 --> 00:32:24.533
I could barely get it out, my throat,

838
00:32:24.533 --> 00:32:26.014
there's things I wanted to say.

839
00:32:26.014 --> 00:32:27.834
Great, let's tune into your body.

840
00:32:27.834 --> 00:32:30.073
He tunes into it and he remembers

841
00:32:30.073 --> 00:32:33.134
that his dad taught him at an early age

842
00:32:33.134 --> 00:32:35.644
if you make money, you're going to get sick

843
00:32:35.644 --> 00:32:38.013
because he asked his dad "How come everybody outside's

844
00:32:38.013 --> 00:32:40.444
"getting Christmas gifts and I'm not."

845
00:32:40.444 --> 00:32:42.674
Christmas gifts, money will make you sick, son,

846
00:32:42.674 --> 00:32:45.413
so that lived in there, but he wouldn't have found it

847
00:32:45.413 --> 00:32:47.984
unless he declared his affirmation

848
00:32:47.984 --> 00:32:49.794
and then listened to his whole body.

849
00:32:49.794 --> 00:32:52.574
That's my really, the cornerstone of my work

850
00:32:52.574 --> 00:32:55.234
is don't just affirm, like I'm 80 pounds lighter,

851
00:32:55.234 --> 00:32:56.674
why didn't I lose 80 pounds.

852
00:32:56.674 --> 00:32:59.074
I want to be 80 pounds lighter.

853
00:32:59.074 --> 00:33:00.934
Oh, I noticed there's a holding here.

854
00:33:00.934 --> 00:33:03.534
That's where I think we can get to the source

855
00:33:03.534 --> 00:33:05.314
of what's keeping us.

856
00:33:05.314 --> 00:33:07.034
To me, that's the law of attraction,

857
00:33:07.034 --> 00:33:10.234
to be able to embody and clear in the body

858
00:33:10.234 --> 00:33:13.214
what is in the way of me having what I want.

859
00:33:13.214 --> 00:33:15.384
If I wanted it, wouldn't I have it?

860
00:33:15.384 --> 00:33:19.124
<v ->You have so many really simple,</v>

861
00:33:19.124 --> 00:33:20.714
in terms of very direct

862
00:33:20.714 --> 00:33:23.937
and easy to understand exercises.

863
00:33:23.937 --> 00:33:25.718
This is not just a book that gives these

864
00:33:25.718 --> 00:33:27.577
lovely examples and talks about the theory,

865
00:33:27.577 --> 00:33:29.017
but it's also a workbook

866
00:33:29.017 --> 00:33:30.758
and you did a beautiful job of laying it out.

867
00:33:30.758 --> 00:33:32.757
I went ahead and went through virtually the whole thing

868
00:33:32.757 --> 00:33:35.917
and tried it out on myself and even found out

869
00:33:35.917 --> 00:33:39.548
a couple things I didn't know that I was holding on to.

870
00:33:39.548 --> 00:33:43.617
I highly encourage anybody that's attracted to this message

871
00:33:43.617 --> 00:33:45.797
to pick up a copy but before we go,

872
00:33:45.797 --> 00:33:49.297
are there any final thoughts that you'd like to share?

873
00:33:49.297 --> 00:33:50.318
<v ->Thank you.</v>

874
00:33:50.318 --> 00:33:53.928
Well, my final thought would be that your body is your ally.

875
00:33:53.928 --> 00:33:55.988
It's your best success coach.

876
00:33:55.988 --> 00:33:57.918
It's your place to go and to really get

877
00:33:57.918 --> 00:34:01.197
the information you need and even if your body hurts,

878
00:34:01.197 --> 00:34:04.038
even if you look in the mirror sometimes and don't like

879
00:34:04.038 --> 00:34:06.698
how it looks, just remember this.

880
00:34:06.698 --> 00:34:08.618
Your body's been there from day one.

881
00:34:08.618 --> 00:34:10.637
It's taken on so much for you,

882
00:34:10.637 --> 00:34:12.257
all those times you wanted to express

883
00:34:12.257 --> 00:34:15.028
and you didn't, your body's held onto it.

884
00:34:15.028 --> 00:34:17.217
I've really, one of my biggest goals in the book

885
00:34:17.217 --> 00:34:20.076
is that people have a better relationship with their body.

886
00:34:20.076 --> 00:34:22.616
That they stop with the I'm going to do this,

887
00:34:22.616 --> 00:34:25.296
the pain in my neck and this darn body,

888
00:34:25.296 --> 00:34:28.237
and start to really become an ally with it.

889
00:34:28.237 --> 00:34:30.796
It's amazing how many areas of your life

890
00:34:30.796 --> 00:34:33.727
will improve if you just take the time

891
00:34:33.727 --> 00:34:36.816
to love and feel and connect with your body.

892
00:34:36.816 --> 00:34:38.496
<v ->So true.
<v Steven>My main message.</v>

893
00:34:38.496 --> 00:34:43.117
<v ->So true, to have a gentle and caring, kinder relationship</v>

894
00:34:43.117 --> 00:34:46.557
with our vehicle that puts up with all of this.

895
00:34:46.557 --> 00:34:48.216
<v ->I thank my body all the time and go</v>

896
00:34:48.216 --> 00:34:50.696
"Thank you for holding onto that. You're free."

897
00:34:50.696 --> 00:34:52.856
I fire you, you can now be free.

898
00:34:52.856 --> 00:34:54.497
You don't need to hold onto that anymore.

899
00:34:54.497 --> 00:34:57.157
Every time I do, something clears, something opens

900
00:34:57.157 --> 00:34:59.457
and then I get more creative, more juicy

901
00:34:59.457 --> 00:35:01.717
and that's my gift to share.

902
00:35:01.717 --> 00:35:05.327
It's your ally, love it, it will love you back.

903
00:35:05.327 --> 00:35:07.137
<v ->On that note, thank you so much</v>

904
00:35:07.137 --> 00:35:08.476
for sharing your time with us.

905
00:35:08.476 --> 00:35:09.537
<v ->Thank you for what you're doing.</v>

906
00:35:09.537 --> 00:35:11.096
It means so much.

907
00:35:13.036 --> 00:35:14.396
<v ->What I love about this book is that</v>

908
00:35:14.396 --> 00:35:16.196
it gives you a step-by-step practice

909
00:35:16.196 --> 00:35:18.076
so that any one of us can learn to use

910
00:35:18.076 --> 00:35:20.096
our deep intuition once again.

911
00:35:20.096 --> 00:35:22.717
To pick up a copy of What's Your Body Telling You,

912
00:35:22.717 --> 00:35:25.656
go to Amazon.com or any other major book seller.

913
00:35:25.656 --> 00:35:28.537
Until next time, thanks for watching CMM.

914
