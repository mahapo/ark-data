00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.411
<v ->There are those few moments in life when something</v>

3
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:16.490
so profound happens that it changes your view of the world.

4
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.771
Such a moment happened for me with Klaus Dona

5
00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:21.911
in his office in Vienna when he handed me the occipital bone

6
00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:26.251
of a human being that was between 21 and 23 feet tall

7
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:27.950
when they once walked the earth.

8
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.250
We've heard of giants in legends throughout history

9
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.271
but here was physical proof.

10
00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:35.090
This along with other extraordinary ancient artifacts

11
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.650
make up the body of his work today as a curator

12
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.140
of unexplained ancient artifacts.

13
00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:44.951
Klaus, it's wonderful to be with you here in Vienna

14
00:00:44.951 --> 00:00:47.670
and I've looked forward to speaking with you about this

15
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.081
because your work is really beginning

16
00:00:52.071 --> 00:00:56.531
to bring together information that has been disbursed

17
00:00:56.531 --> 00:01:00.471
up until now in this very detailed work of hunting down

18
00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:02.051
and working with these artifacts.

19
00:01:02.051 --> 00:01:05.591
But, you didn't start with artifacts so let's talk about

20
00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:10.591
where you began in the acquisition of artifacts, artwork,

21
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:13.771
and so forth prior to where you are now

22
00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:15.481
so people can get to know you a bit.

23
00:01:16.771 --> 00:01:21.752
<v ->I was doing cultural exhibitions mainly from Austria</v>

24
00:01:21.752 --> 00:01:26.658
to Japan and also to Korea and I had a lot of time

25
00:01:26.658 --> 00:01:29.449
in the airplanes and also in the hotel rooms

26
00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:32.540
and I read many books.

27
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.702
I was skeptic against many things and one day

28
00:01:36.702 --> 00:01:41.702
I just had the idea it would be the best, select all these

29
00:01:41.842 --> 00:01:46.022
strange artifacts which are presented in some

30
00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:49.522
of the books and bring them to Vienna into an exhibition

31
00:01:49.522 --> 00:01:52.842
and give the scientists a chance to check on them

32
00:01:52.842 --> 00:01:56.503
and find out if they really are originally really old

33
00:01:56.503 --> 00:02:00.883
or new and fakes or frauds.

34
00:02:00.883 --> 00:02:05.543
So, this was a little bit naive, I didn't know that it

35
00:02:05.543 --> 00:02:09.323
brings a lot of problems and trouble.

36
00:02:09.323 --> 00:02:13.433
The biggest surprise was we found some scientists,

37
00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:18.432
they did us some researches on some of the pieces

38
00:02:19.342 --> 00:02:22.923
and they never found out that these pieces are new done.

39
00:02:22.923 --> 00:02:24.983
<v Regina>They never found out that they were fakes?</v>

40
00:02:24.983 --> 00:02:26.523
In otherwords, they were all originals.

41
00:02:26.523 --> 00:02:27.242
<v ->Yes.</v>

42
00:02:27.242 --> 00:02:28.623
<v Regina>So that surprised you?</v>

43
00:02:28.623 --> 00:02:33.090
<v ->A lot, and it made me change my mind</v>

44
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.980
as the big skeptic.

45
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.320
I started to research more and more and the more you

46
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.660
research in these fields you find more interesting things.

47
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.280
<v Regina>And the stranger it gets.</v>

48
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.200
<v ->Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.860
<v Regina>Stranger and stranger.</v>

50
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.180
<v ->Yeah, you'd think you get some answers, but all you get</v>

51
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.620
is even more and more questions.

52
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.100
<v Regina>Yes, and we're sitting here, we'll look at them</v>

53
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.260
in a little bit, with some unbelievable artifacts

54
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.700
that you have brought back from different places.

55
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.987
I've seen your DVD presentation and your other interviews

56
00:03:12.987 --> 00:03:17.977
and slide show and there are some, we can't cover all

57
00:03:17.977 --> 00:03:20.282
of them, I would encourage people to look at the DVD

58
00:03:20.282 --> 00:03:22.000
to cover all of them, but there are some

59
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.780
areas we can go into.

60
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.879
And, I would like to start maybe with the ones

61
00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.587
that you found, the region of the world and artifacts

62
00:03:30.528 --> 00:03:33.348
once you opened up this whole can of worms, as it were,

63
00:03:33.348 --> 00:03:36.699
that you found to be the most deeply fascinating.

64
00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:42.108
<v ->That's very hard to answer this question because</v>

65
00:03:42.108 --> 00:03:46.789
they are all, each piece gives you a new idea

66
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:51.048
or shows you a new way so that means for me,

67
00:03:51.048 --> 00:03:54.809
as I said many times, each piece is for me like a piece

68
00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:57.730
of a puzzle,of a huge puzzle.

69
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.000
And, to put them together, maybe and hopefully

70
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.340
in the near future we are able to find

71
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.939
at least a kind of final picture.

72
00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:13.400
But, the final picture, I think, we would need hundreds

73
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.359
of more years.

74
00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.519
<v Regina>On that note let's start then,</v>

75
00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.279
We'll just start somewhere, a piece of the puzzle

76
00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.639
that I think most people are fascinated with

77
00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.320
is the subject of giants that walked upon the Earth.

78
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.779
There are books devoted to this, there's speculation,

79
00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:32.899
but let's talk about it from an artifact point-of-view

80
00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:34.570
what you have discovered.

81
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.153
<v ->I found bones of a 7.6 meter giant,</v>

82
00:04:43.523 --> 00:04:45.663
in Ecuador.
<v Regina>25 feet tall.</v>

83
00:04:45.663 --> 00:04:48.443
<v ->Nearly 25 feet tall.</v>

84
00:04:48.443 --> 00:04:52.823
And, for me also when I got this information

85
00:04:52.823 --> 00:04:55.406
first I was really, again, skeptical.

86
00:04:55.406 --> 00:05:00.405
I thought 7.6 meter, nearly 25 feet, that's too big.

87
00:05:00.405 --> 00:05:04.066
It's impossible, so I went to a Ecuador.

88
00:05:04.066 --> 00:05:06.168
I found the family of

89
00:05:08.322 --> 00:05:12.222
Father Carlos Vaca, he was a priest

90
00:05:12.222 --> 00:05:16.431
and he was called by people in a small

91
00:05:17.162 --> 00:05:21.401
walley inside the south moutains of--

92
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:22.622
<v Regina>A little valley?</v>

93
00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:26.542
<v ->Ecuador and there was a heavy storm and part of</v>

94
00:05:26.542 --> 00:05:30.505
a mountain platform was broken down and huge

95
00:05:31.715 --> 00:05:35.615
bones, completely destroyed, broken, came up,

96
00:05:35.615 --> 00:05:38.094
appeared on the surface.

97
00:05:38.094 --> 00:05:40.735
So, they were very anxious and they called

98
00:05:40.735 --> 00:05:45.175
Father Carlos Vaca and he was as a priest working

99
00:05:46.036 --> 00:05:50.257
in hospital in Ecuador, so he knew

100
00:05:50.257 --> 00:05:52.817
what kind of bones they might be

101
00:05:52.817 --> 00:05:55.277
so they called him and he checked the bones

102
00:05:55.277 --> 00:05:59.222
and he found out that it was a human skeleton.

103
00:06:00.176 --> 00:06:03.716
And, they did measurements and they got the conclusion

104
00:06:03.716 --> 00:06:08.296
that this human being was 7.6 meters.

105
00:06:08.296 --> 00:06:11.616
And, I was allowed to bring some of the bones with me

106
00:06:11.616 --> 00:06:15.876
from the family to do some checkings here in Austria.

107
00:06:15.876 --> 00:06:20.456
And, two pieces were recognized by professors

108
00:06:20.456 --> 00:06:24.896
of Anatomic Institute and doctors.

109
00:06:24.896 --> 00:06:29.728
One is a part of the heel bone and the other one

110
00:06:30.358 --> 00:06:33.158
is the so-called occipital.

111
00:06:33.158 --> 00:06:37.578
It's a bone which we have exactly in the center under

112
00:06:37.578 --> 00:06:42.529
the skull which makes us able to move our skull.

113
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.982
So, we did even comparison with original human

114
00:06:48.832 --> 00:06:52.852
occipitals they look exactly the same, but again

115
00:06:52.852 --> 00:06:57.721
the difference is about five times bigger, this piece is--

116
00:06:57.721 --> 00:06:59.455
<v Regina>Yes, that's a huge piece for these little</v>

117
00:06:59.455 --> 00:07:01.115
occipital bones back here.

118
00:07:01.115 --> 00:07:05.716
<v ->Yeah, they are about this size in our size,</v>

119
00:07:05.716 --> 00:07:08.956
and here it's about five times bigger.

120
00:07:08.956 --> 00:07:13.596
So, again, we have a lot of in archives

121
00:07:13.596 --> 00:07:17.897
we find some documentations that they wrote

122
00:07:17.897 --> 00:07:22.838
in the 1570s, 1580s that they found

123
00:07:22.838 --> 00:07:25.819
several human skeletons on the coast

124
00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:28.819
of Esmereldas in Ecuador.

125
00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:33.138
And, if you think that the people at that time,

126
00:07:33.138 --> 00:07:38.138
the Spanish people, they were about 150 centimeters.

127
00:07:38.358 --> 00:07:42.801
So, if you multiply 150 five times you reach

128
00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:47.612
exactly 750 or 7.5, 7.6 meters.

129
00:07:48.462 --> 00:07:52.739
And, we found also a big granite stone axe

130
00:07:53.609 --> 00:07:58.049
in a museum in Cuenca which is about 70 centimeters,

131
00:07:58.049 --> 00:07:59.420
that means that size.

132
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:04.900
Very heavy granite and you can even see where

133
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:09.900
some bindings was held around

134
00:08:09.982 --> 00:08:12.382
the granite stone.

135
00:08:12.382 --> 00:08:16.003
Again, we did comparisons with normal stone axes

136
00:08:16.003 --> 00:08:18.942
and they are exactly again five times bigger.

137
00:08:18.942 --> 00:08:23.636
That means these big stone axes are called

138
00:08:23.636 --> 00:08:25.617
ceremonial axes--

139
00:08:25.617 --> 00:08:26.897
<v Regina>Eggs?</v>

140
00:08:26.897 --> 00:08:29.418
<v ->But the question is for what kind, axe.</v>

141
00:08:29.418 --> 00:08:30.978
<v Regina>Oh axe, axes.</v>

142
00:08:30.978 --> 00:08:32.077
<v ->Axes, sorry.</v>

143
00:08:32.077 --> 00:08:33.817
<v Regina>Thank you, now we have the right picture.</v>

144
00:08:33.817 --> 00:08:34.897
I was looking at an egg.

145
00:08:34.897 --> 00:08:37.017
<v ->My pronuciation is not perfect, axe.</v>

146
00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:38.999
<v Regina>Axes, okay, so if would have been the right</v>

147
00:08:38.999 --> 00:08:41.339
length to wield by of someone of that height.

148
00:08:41.339 --> 00:08:44.979
<v ->For a big person like this giant.</v>

149
00:08:44.979 --> 00:08:47.262
<v Regina>If you're 25 or 30 feet tall.</v>

150
00:08:47.262 --> 00:08:48.581
<v ->It would fit perfectly.</v>

151
00:08:48.581 --> 00:08:51.182
<v Regina>I can't tell you what a privilege it is to be</v>

152
00:08:51.182 --> 00:08:55.742
sitting with you and to be able to hold a piece of a being

153
00:08:55.742 --> 00:08:57.622
that lived that was that tall.

154
00:08:57.622 --> 00:09:00.547
And, the one thing I noticed about it while holding it

155
00:09:00.547 --> 00:09:04.259
is that it's incredibly porous.

156
00:09:05.409 --> 00:09:07.390
It's not heavy.

157
00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:08.108
<v ->No.</v>

158
00:09:08.108 --> 00:09:10.929
<v Regina>Now, could this be through a type of erosion,</v>

159
00:09:10.929 --> 00:09:14.649
evaporation, or something, decomposition that it's so

160
00:09:14.649 --> 00:09:18.384
lightweight, or is it possible this being, according to

161
00:09:18.384 --> 00:09:22.464
the anatomical researchers, that whoever this being was

162
00:09:22.464 --> 00:09:25.864
may have actually had a much lighter skeletal structure?

163
00:09:25.864 --> 00:09:29.404
<v ->That could be, that's what we still have to do</v>

164
00:09:29.404 --> 00:09:33.984
some more researches on bones from this skeleton.

165
00:09:33.984 --> 00:09:36.164
<v Regina>Let's talk about where else in the world,</v>

166
00:09:36.164 --> 00:09:38.344
I mean your research has taken you everywhere.

167
00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:40.584
And, you've certainly be made aware you have an incredible

168
00:09:40.584 --> 00:09:42.724
connection of people around the world.

169
00:09:42.724 --> 00:09:46.324
Where else in the world have we seen these tall beings,

170
00:09:46.324 --> 00:09:47.804
these giants?

171
00:09:47.804 --> 00:09:52.085
<v ->So, tall giants were seen only by</v>

172
00:09:52.085 --> 00:09:56.965
one Russian professor, Professor Ernst Muldashev in Tibet.

173
00:09:56.965 --> 00:09:58.124
<v Regina>For this height.</v>

174
00:09:58.124 --> 00:10:01.125
<v ->Because they are the so called Samahdi Tunnels,</v>

175
00:10:01.125 --> 00:10:05.261
Samahdi Caves and he heard about on

176
00:10:05.261 --> 00:10:09.441
his several times travels to Tibet he heard about

177
00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:14.061
the Samahdi Caves and he was talking with some monks

178
00:10:14.061 --> 00:10:17.195
and he got friendship with them and they explain him

179
00:10:17.195 --> 00:10:21.695
that inside these Samahdi Caves there are human

180
00:10:21.695 --> 00:10:26.515
with different size beginning from normal size,

181
00:10:26.515 --> 00:10:30.976
of our human size up to 10 meters.

182
00:10:30.976 --> 00:10:34.284
That means even bigger, taller
<v Regina>10 meters?</v>

183
00:10:34.284 --> 00:10:36.344
<v ->than the Equadorian.
<v Regina>About 33 feet tall.</v>

184
00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:37.404
<v ->That's right.</v>

185
00:10:37.404 --> 00:10:42.064
So, after several trips there and getting closer

186
00:10:42.064 --> 00:10:46.845
and closer friendship to the monks they

187
00:10:47.955 --> 00:10:52.094
allowed him to do a special meditation

188
00:10:52.094 --> 00:10:56.245
and after few days he was able to enter into

189
00:10:56.245 --> 00:10:59.765
one of those Samahdi Caves because usually

190
00:10:59.765 --> 00:11:03.905
if you enter, they are protected

191
00:11:03.905 --> 00:11:08.486
through energy, that means you could go in

192
00:11:08.486 --> 00:11:11.965
but from the beginning you start getting headache,

193
00:11:11.965 --> 00:11:14.965
heavy headache and it's getting more and more

194
00:11:14.965 --> 00:11:16.765
until you are dead.

195
00:11:16.765 --> 00:11:17.886
<v Regina>Yes, I understand.</v>

196
00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:20.786
<v ->So, he was allowed and through this special meditation</v>

197
00:11:20.786 --> 00:11:24.806
he could enter into one of these Samahdi Caves

198
00:11:24.806 --> 00:11:29.308
and he saw human in different size

199
00:11:29.308 --> 00:11:32.568
sitting in the lotus seat and the bodies

200
00:11:32.568 --> 00:11:36.789
have no functions, but they are not dead.

201
00:11:36.789 --> 00:11:40.289
That means that the explaination of the monks was

202
00:11:40.289 --> 00:11:42.929
that they are connected with a silver string

203
00:11:42.929 --> 00:11:44.509
with the universe.

204
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:48.289
That means that they could be able to go back to life

205
00:11:48.289 --> 00:11:50.249
whenever they would decide.

206
00:11:50.249 --> 00:11:53.689
<v Regina>So, it's almost in a suspended animation.</v>

207
00:11:53.689 --> 00:11:56.489
Do the organs still function?

208
00:11:56.489 --> 00:11:57.389
<v ->No.</v>

209
00:11:57.389 --> 00:11:59.709
<v Regina>They're sleeping, everything's asleep?</v>

210
00:11:59.709 --> 00:12:03.810
<v ->They're completely, body has completely zero function,</v>

211
00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.410
but the bodies are not dead.

212
00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.670
That means they really could go back to life

213
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.930
whenever they would decide.

214
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:15.892
<v Regina>And, what types of bodies was he seeing in there?</v>

215
00:12:15.892 --> 00:12:18.685
<v ->Very strange ones, normal ones,</v>

216
00:12:18.685 --> 00:12:21.985
but also up to 10 meters.

217
00:12:21.985 --> 00:12:26.665
And, he is the Russian's most famous eye doctor because

218
00:12:26.665 --> 00:12:31.375
he did until now the only functioning eye transplantation.

219
00:12:32.104 --> 00:12:36.005
And, he's also a member of Academy of Science in Russia,

220
00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:39.405
but still his colleagues, of course, didn't believe him.

221
00:12:39.405 --> 00:12:43.208
So, when he heard about my story

222
00:12:43.208 --> 00:12:46.448
about bones from Ecuador from

223
00:12:47.968 --> 00:12:52.213
a nearly 25 feet giant he visited me with his

224
00:12:52.213 --> 00:12:54.812
expert colleague and they check the bones

225
00:12:54.812 --> 00:12:58.112
and they also recognized that these bones

226
00:12:58.112 --> 00:13:01.258
are from a real human giant.

227
00:13:01.258 --> 00:13:05.758
And, it's an approval for him, not only approval for him,

228
00:13:05.758 --> 00:13:10.057
for his colleagues that his story is not just a story.

229
00:13:11.397 --> 00:13:15.997
The Samahdi's really exist, are existing in Tibet

230
00:13:15.997 --> 00:13:20.332
and Tibetan monks told him that the same

231
00:13:20.332 --> 00:13:25.112
Samahdi Caves are in Mexico and in South America.

232
00:13:25.112 --> 00:13:29.451
And, there are stories about the Spanish Conquistadors

233
00:13:29.451 --> 00:13:31.694
when they took out the mummies

234
00:13:33.402 --> 00:13:37.765
from the real Incas they steal, and it was described

235
00:13:37.765 --> 00:13:40.925
in historical papers that they still had the skin

236
00:13:40.925 --> 00:13:44.527
like in life and the question is

237
00:13:44.527 --> 00:13:49.478
were they Samadhis or what kind of

238
00:13:50.574 --> 00:13:53.415
mummification did they use that the skin

239
00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:57.095
was nearly like from living people?

240
00:13:57.095 --> 00:13:59.294
<v Regina>And, maybe what kind of chamber were they</v>

241
00:13:59.294 --> 00:14:02.475
preserved in, what were the energetic forces in the chamber?

242
00:14:02.475 --> 00:14:04.895
<v ->That's the other question, yeah.</v>

243
00:14:04.895 --> 00:14:08.986
<v Regina>So, that would indicate we're looking at</v>

244
00:14:10.097 --> 00:14:14.317
a couple of continents anyway, well three, if we're looking

245
00:14:14.317 --> 00:14:15.577
at the giants.

246
00:14:15.577 --> 00:14:18.477
And also, there have been legends of the discovery

247
00:14:18.477 --> 00:14:20.496
of giants, there was quite a lot around the turn of

248
00:14:20.496 --> 00:14:25.121
the 20th century where even in the midwest

249
00:14:25.121 --> 00:14:29.140
in America there were small newspaper articles

250
00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:34.052
of explorers, hikers stumbling across certain ones.

251
00:14:36.143 --> 00:14:40.802
<v ->I recieved a lot of archive documents from American</v>

252
00:14:40.802 --> 00:14:44.505
newspapers from 1880

253
00:14:44.505 --> 00:14:48.145
up to 1920, 1925.

254
00:14:48.145 --> 00:14:52.205
Then, the reports stopped and this is very strange

255
00:14:52.205 --> 00:14:56.137
because I'm quite sure that even up to today

256
00:14:57.207 --> 00:15:01.867
there are giant skeleton findings, for example in Utah.

257
00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:06.787
I recieved from Wayne May the publisher from

258
00:15:06.787 --> 00:15:11.107
Ancient American magazine, I recieved a lot of photos

259
00:15:11.107 --> 00:15:16.019
of 2.6 meter giant's skeletons from Utah.

260
00:15:17.128 --> 00:15:21.729
Also, from Bolivia they found skeletons with oversized,

261
00:15:21.729 --> 00:15:24.909
also 2.5 meters.

262
00:15:24.909 --> 00:15:28.929
So, all over the world and the strange thing is that in

263
00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:33.688
the old newspaper reports there's exactly written

264
00:15:33.688 --> 00:15:38.592
the name of the archeologist and most of these reports

265
00:15:38.592 --> 00:15:42.211
are ending that these skeletons were brought to

266
00:15:42.211 --> 00:15:44.191
the Smithsonian Institution.

267
00:15:44.191 --> 00:15:47.011
<v Regina>Okay, that's what I was just going to add</v>

268
00:15:47.011 --> 00:15:49.891
to the conversation, the same thing the finding in

269
00:15:49.891 --> 00:15:51.551
the Phoenix newspaper.

270
00:15:51.551 --> 00:15:56.134
I think it was 1909, 1910 about the huge cache

271
00:15:56.134 --> 00:15:59.834
of Egyptian artifacts that were found in a cave

272
00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:00.665
in the Grand Canyon.

273
00:16:00.665 --> 00:16:01.485
<v ->In the Grand Canyon.</v>

274
00:16:01.485 --> 00:16:03.541
<v Regina>And, the Smithsonian came and the story ended</v>

275
00:16:03.541 --> 00:16:06.296
and all the stuff is gone, it was all spirited away, I don't

276
00:16:06.296 --> 00:16:08.282
know where they took it.
<v ->Now, it's prohibited area.</v>

277
00:16:08.282 --> 00:16:09.942
<v Regina>It's a prohibited area, that's right.</v>

278
00:16:09.942 --> 00:16:12.583
And, it's the people who have gotten to it and know where

279
00:16:12.583 --> 00:16:16.713
it is say this is a very difficult place to access

280
00:16:17.424 --> 00:16:20.403
unless you're accessing it from some other means,

281
00:16:20.403 --> 00:16:22.144
certainly not from hiking.

282
00:16:22.144 --> 00:16:24.822
You're not gonna take that load of artifacts in hiking

283
00:16:24.822 --> 00:16:25.842
it down in there.

284
00:16:25.842 --> 00:16:29.402
So, that's interesting and also in the southwest another man

285
00:16:29.402 --> 00:16:31.312
that I met with briefly,

286
00:16:34.043 --> 00:16:36.233
he's been more or less silenced,

287
00:16:37.543 --> 00:16:41.624
was showing his slideshow of the red-headed giants

288
00:16:41.624 --> 00:16:45.584
in the southwest that are entombed in these cylinders.

289
00:16:45.584 --> 00:16:48.283
And, it showed the remains and still the hair and skin

290
00:16:48.283 --> 00:16:52.264
was on them, about 15, 16 feet tall.

291
00:16:53.783 --> 00:16:58.035
<v ->Yeah, I also got a report from Utah that</v>

292
00:16:59.284 --> 00:17:03.834
a man there found in a cave two mummies.

293
00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:08.075
The man had red hair and was about three meters

294
00:17:08.786 --> 00:17:13.076
and had a kind like armory on it,

295
00:17:13.905 --> 00:17:18.305
and the lady was blonde and 2.7 meter.

296
00:17:18.305 --> 00:17:23.105
And, in the same cave there were about 60 stone boxes

297
00:17:23.105 --> 00:17:27.526
precisely done with copper plates with a completely

298
00:17:27.526 --> 00:17:29.586
unknown writing on it.

299
00:17:29.586 --> 00:17:31.126
It's very interesting.

300
00:17:31.126 --> 00:17:35.047
<v Regina>It is, I just love this subject, fascinating</v>

301
00:17:35.047 --> 00:17:37.506
because it fits nothing of what we know of the history

302
00:17:37.506 --> 00:17:38.966
of our own lands.

303
00:17:38.966 --> 00:17:43.106
And even these artifacts that we will feature in just

304
00:17:43.106 --> 00:17:46.687
a moment sitting before us, I can't even fathom

305
00:17:46.687 --> 00:17:48.276
how this flute was made.

306
00:17:49.386 --> 00:17:52.086
Nothing that I can see in it would make sense to be able

307
00:17:52.086 --> 00:17:55.646
to carve from the inside without any access points.

308
00:17:55.646 --> 00:17:58.666
And, these other pieces, you have no idea of what age

309
00:17:58.666 --> 00:18:00.146
they are, where they're from.

310
00:18:00.146 --> 00:18:04.366
Oh, by the way, getting back to the giants, it's not

311
00:18:04.366 --> 00:18:07.186
possible to capture any DNA out of this.

312
00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:11.748
<v ->No, we asked the expert for archeological</v>

313
00:18:11.748 --> 00:18:15.911
DNA research in Salsburg in Austria

314
00:18:15.911 --> 00:18:20.193
and he did a lot of test on the bones

315
00:18:20.193 --> 00:18:24.494
but he told me it's completely impossible to get even

316
00:18:24.494 --> 00:18:29.053
a little piece of chance of doing a DNA on these bones.

317
00:18:29.053 --> 00:18:32.134
That means they must be really very, very old.

318
00:18:32.134 --> 00:18:36.813
<v Regina>Very old, you said that in common understanding</v>

319
00:18:36.813 --> 00:18:41.315
they can't DNA past, can't do an analysis

320
00:18:41.315 --> 00:18:42.932
past 10,000 years.

321
00:18:42.932 --> 00:18:46.511
<v ->That's what he told me, of course, it depends where</v>

322
00:18:46.511 --> 00:18:51.283
in which area which kind of earth the bones were covered.

323
00:18:52.232 --> 00:18:56.353
Sometimes, it even doesn't take 10,000 years.

324
00:18:56.353 --> 00:19:01.072
Even if the earth is contaminated, it takes only a few years

325
00:19:01.072 --> 00:19:04.753
and it might be impossible to get any DNA.

326
00:19:04.753 --> 00:19:09.712
It depends of the condition where the bones were covered.

327
00:19:09.712 --> 00:19:12.312
<v Regina>But, aren't they always attempting to do</v>

328
00:19:12.312 --> 00:19:16.432
DNA analysis on, you know, the big archeological digs

329
00:19:16.432 --> 00:19:19.313
looking for, you know, the missing link in humanity?

330
00:19:19.313 --> 00:19:22.272
Don't the try to carbon date it?

331
00:19:23.355 --> 00:19:25.426
Are they able to obtain any DNA?

332
00:19:26.376 --> 00:19:30.275
<v ->That's the big question I'm also asking, for example,</v>

333
00:19:30.275 --> 00:19:35.275
in Peru there are these elongated skulls, where offically

334
00:19:35.276 --> 00:19:39.835
they are elongated, artificial elongated,

335
00:19:41.176 --> 00:19:45.669
but I think they are natural that size

336
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:48.289
and that form.

337
00:19:48.289 --> 00:19:53.140
So, it would be quite easy to take a little piece of bone

338
00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.410
and even some of these skulls they still have hair

339
00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:59.410
on them and skin particles.

340
00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:02.770
So, it would be quite easy to do a DNA analysis

341
00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.309
and age dating.

342
00:20:04.309 --> 00:20:05.769
<v Regina>Yeah, with the skin and hair</v>

343
00:20:05.769 --> 00:20:07.069
you should be able to.

344
00:20:07.069 --> 00:20:09.089
So, is this in the works?

345
00:20:09.089 --> 00:20:11.290
<v ->The question is why they don't do it.</v>

346
00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:14.609
<v Regina>Is it possible that you'll be able to</v>

347
00:20:15.709 --> 00:20:17.498
faciliate some of this in Europe?

348
00:20:17.498 --> 00:20:21.138
You're going to be doing an exhibition next year.

349
00:20:21.138 --> 00:20:24.938
<v ->If I could get one of these skulls, and of course, I would</v>

350
00:20:24.938 --> 00:20:29.538
ask if we are allowed to do certain check on it,

351
00:20:29.538 --> 00:20:32.438
the of course we would do it.

352
00:20:33.678 --> 00:20:35.638
<v Regina>I think everybody watching right now</v>

353
00:20:35.638 --> 00:20:37.838
will look forward to seeing if that does come to pass.

354
00:20:37.838 --> 00:20:41.819
And meanwhile, talking about elongated skulls, you have

355
00:20:41.819 --> 00:20:46.559
this little piece here and we'll get a closeup on this one.

356
00:20:46.559 --> 00:20:50.179
And, it's the same thing again that we've seen repeatedly

357
00:20:50.179 --> 00:20:53.679
and also shows itself in the Egyptian heiroglyphics,

358
00:20:53.679 --> 00:20:57.628
and that is this little person with this cone shaped head.

359
00:20:58.878 --> 00:21:01.938
This pops up all over the world and this particular

360
00:21:01.938 --> 00:21:05.628
artifact is part of a group from?

361
00:21:06.638 --> 00:21:10.918
<v Klaus>Central America, a farmer found in a cave</v>

362
00:21:10.918 --> 00:21:13.898
3,000 artifacts.

363
00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:17.462
2,500 are stone made

364
00:21:17.462 --> 00:21:19.762
and carvings in stones.

365
00:21:19.762 --> 00:21:23.782
The smallest one is like a medallion and up to

366
00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:26.742
50 centimeter size.

367
00:21:26.742 --> 00:21:31.703
And, around 500 pieces are made out of kaolin,

368
00:21:32.586 --> 00:21:35.626
kaolin is a material which normally is used

369
00:21:35.626 --> 00:21:38.006
to make porcelain.

370
00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:40.876
You cannot carve it, you must

371
00:21:44.446 --> 00:21:49.446
put it into a form to get this piece for example.

372
00:21:49.706 --> 00:21:51.846
<v Regina>So, it has to be poured into a mold.</v>

373
00:21:51.846 --> 00:21:54.646
<v ->In a mold, so what does it mean?</v>

374
00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:59.126
You need the negative form, you need the molding form

375
00:21:59.126 --> 00:22:01.066
and then you can make it.

376
00:22:01.066 --> 00:22:05.567
And, first of all, you must be a real good artist to be able

377
00:22:05.567 --> 00:22:08.027
to make such pieces.

378
00:22:08.027 --> 00:22:10.166
<v Regina>Oh, these are amazing pieces.</v>

379
00:22:10.166 --> 00:22:13.466
<v ->That's number one, here you have for example,</v>

380
00:22:13.466 --> 00:22:17.726
a complete elongated skull and this looks exactly like

381
00:22:17.726 --> 00:22:21.846
some of the skulls from Ica in Peru, that's very close

382
00:22:21.846 --> 00:22:23.466
to the Nazca Lines.

383
00:22:23.466 --> 00:22:26.596
So, it's very strange and therefore I would be really

384
00:22:26.596 --> 00:22:31.537
interested in doing a DNA analysis on some these skulls.

385
00:22:34.067 --> 00:22:39.067
Second, to make 500 pieces that means

386
00:22:39.939 --> 00:22:44.440
you must make 500 negative molding forms

387
00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.159
and then the molding form itself.

388
00:22:47.159 --> 00:22:49.139
<v Regina>Because you wouldn't be able to reuse the mold.</v>

389
00:22:49.139 --> 00:22:53.244
<v ->And, then you just make out of each one, you make only</v>

390
00:22:53.244 --> 00:22:57.444
one piece, I mean that wouldn't make any sense.

391
00:22:57.444 --> 00:23:02.227
Then we did specific weight checking

392
00:23:02.227 --> 00:23:06.982
in Vienna and we had to put this piece, which you hold now

393
00:23:06.982 --> 00:23:09.883
in your hand, we had to put it into the water for the

394
00:23:09.883 --> 00:23:14.470
specific weight test and when I got it back

395
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:19.402
and it was wet I tried to move

396
00:23:19.402 --> 00:23:22.881
a little bit from the patina.

397
00:23:22.881 --> 00:23:27.532
As you can see here, this,

398
00:23:28.462 --> 00:23:32.341
the patina was easy to remove.

399
00:23:32.341 --> 00:23:36.122
So, I was very much surprised and I thought,

400
00:23:36.122 --> 00:23:40.761
"Oh, this is a fraud," because usually if you have

401
00:23:41.371 --> 00:23:45.901
an artifact with such a patina and you put it into the water

402
00:23:45.901 --> 00:23:49.782
and you take it out you cannot remove the patina that easy

403
00:23:49.782 --> 00:23:54.772
because it connects with the original material the patina.

404
00:23:56.122 --> 00:24:00.257
So, I talked with a physicist about this

405
00:24:00.257 --> 00:24:04.878
and he explained me that on this material the patina

406
00:24:04.878 --> 00:24:09.198
cannot connect to the original material.

407
00:24:12.017 --> 00:24:13.917
<v Regina>Because of the nature of the ceramic?</v>

408
00:24:13.917 --> 00:24:16.578
<v ->Right, the nature of this material.</v>

409
00:24:16.578 --> 00:24:20.377
So, he explained, of course, in hundred, in 500,

410
00:24:20.377 --> 00:24:24.079
in 1000 years it's getting a patina,

411
00:24:24.079 --> 00:24:28.039
but comparing with other material the patina

412
00:24:28.039 --> 00:24:31.419
would not be able to connect completely with

413
00:24:31.419 --> 00:24:35.119
the original material and that's why

414
00:24:35.119 --> 00:24:38.819
it is very simple that you can remove the patina,

415
00:24:38.819 --> 00:24:42.659
even it's very old from this piece is very easy.

416
00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:47.960
But again, personally, I was surprised, I thought,

417
00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:52.920
"Uh-oh, this is a fraud because why you can remove

418
00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.960
"the patina that easy."

419
00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:59.700
But, if you talk with really good scientists sometimes

420
00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.020
you get a good explanation.

421
00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:05.920
<v Regina>These are in such an incredibly good condition.</v>

422
00:25:07.239 --> 00:25:10.880
When you said they were found, were they found more or less

423
00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.739
as a collection or a pile or were they in the earth?

424
00:25:14.739 --> 00:25:17.740
<v ->No, they were stored in the cave.</v>

425
00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.999
<v Regina>Stored in a cave.</v>
<v ->And, the cave was closed.</v>

426
00:25:20.999 --> 00:25:24.428
<v Regina>Okay, so I don't know, certainly no one's</v>

427
00:25:24.428 --> 00:25:26.468
going to take a hammer to them, but they're very

428
00:25:26.468 --> 00:25:28.488
lightweight actually.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

429
00:25:28.488 --> 00:25:32.188
<v Regina>It's almost like it's a type of a clay of some</v>

430
00:25:32.188 --> 00:25:33.887
kind, but it's not clay?

431
00:25:33.887 --> 00:25:35.187
<v ->It's not clay.</v>

432
00:25:35.187 --> 00:25:38.069
<v Regina>And, they have no idea where these little</v>

433
00:25:38.069 --> 00:25:42.510
cone head people came from, these little figures?

434
00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:45.089
<v ->Yeah, but they are in this collection there are many</v>

435
00:25:45.089 --> 00:25:48.540
different types of cone heads,

436
00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:53.443
of elongated heads, of different eyes

437
00:25:53.443 --> 00:25:54.763
and everything.

438
00:25:54.763 --> 00:25:58.623
So, that means it looks like a collection of really

439
00:25:58.623 --> 00:26:03.014
different type of humans or whatsoever.

440
00:26:03.684 --> 00:26:06.844
<v Regina>So, it could be humans, it could be non-humans</v>

441
00:26:06.844 --> 00:26:09.304
I mean you get a lot of the big eyes and the cone heads

442
00:26:09.304 --> 00:26:11.285
and the things we typically see when people

443
00:26:11.285 --> 00:26:16.005
have depicted aliens either through their own experiences

444
00:26:16.005 --> 00:26:17.766
or when they've found other artworks.

445
00:26:17.766 --> 00:26:19.185
Certainly, a lot of other artwork exists

446
00:26:19.185 --> 00:26:20.225
throughout the world.

447
00:26:20.225 --> 00:26:22.885
<v ->But, the problem with these pieces is that there are</v>

448
00:26:22.885 --> 00:26:27.165
some people which so perfect in carvings, even in stones,

449
00:26:27.165 --> 00:26:30.598
with sun eruptions showing also

450
00:26:31.987 --> 00:26:35.900
black holes, worm holes, and such thing.

451
00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:39.911
So, it's very hard to prove the

452
00:26:40.841 --> 00:26:44.090
authenticity of these pieces because they are too good

453
00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:45.830
and this is the problem.
<v Regina>They're too good.</v>

454
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:47.261
You don't know what culture they came from.

455
00:26:47.261 --> 00:26:49.633
And yet, at the same time, there's no, as you say,

456
00:26:49.633 --> 00:26:52.392
there's no indication that they're fraudulent.

457
00:26:52.392 --> 00:26:53.318
<v ->No.</v>

458
00:26:54.068 --> 00:26:57.568
<v Regina>And, this is interesting, I mean, trying to</v>

459
00:26:57.568 --> 00:27:01.148
ascertain what just this one piece means you have the side

460
00:27:01.148 --> 00:27:05.888
of the face of a sharp toothed creature of some kind

461
00:27:05.888 --> 00:27:10.028
and on the inside of the mouth is the face of a human being

462
00:27:10.028 --> 00:27:14.048
being imbedded or housed within another being.

463
00:27:14.048 --> 00:27:18.328
And then, it looks like technology like a spaceship even,

464
00:27:18.328 --> 00:27:21.247
like it could be a spaceship very easily.

465
00:27:21.247 --> 00:27:24.868
I mean, this ellipitical part, I mean,

466
00:27:27.579 --> 00:27:32.571
it seems like we're getting very, very close as a species

467
00:27:32.571 --> 00:27:36.193
to starting to see a very interesting

468
00:27:36.193 --> 00:27:38.384
human path emerge.

469
00:27:40.214 --> 00:27:43.255
<v ->And, especially I was very surprised when I recieved</v>

470
00:27:43.255 --> 00:27:47.734
the first photos from this collection because I always

471
00:27:47.734 --> 00:27:51.405
said I would not talk about aliens and

472
00:27:53.196 --> 00:27:56.415
flying saucers and everything as long as I do not

473
00:27:56.415 --> 00:27:59.135
have any approval.

474
00:27:59.135 --> 00:28:03.815
But, when I recieved 500 and more photos from this

475
00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:07.655
collection some of them different kinds of stones

476
00:28:07.655 --> 00:28:11.195
in carvings, some of them like these pieces here

477
00:28:12.595 --> 00:28:17.440
from different material then you really start thinking

478
00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.539
what is this really?

479
00:28:20.539 --> 00:28:24.919
And, as I said before, the in carvings are sometimes

480
00:28:24.919 --> 00:28:29.190
so precise and so perfect I would say too good

481
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:31.529
for the scientists, they would never believe it

482
00:28:31.529 --> 00:28:34.509
and accept it as original artifacts.

483
00:28:34.509 --> 00:28:36.489
<v Regina>And, we were talking off-camera and you said</v>

484
00:28:36.489 --> 00:28:40.430
some of these even show beings that have helmets on.

485
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.969
<v ->Yes, you can even see that there is a kind of glass</v>

486
00:28:46.289 --> 00:28:48.290
closed, the helmet with glass--

487
00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:50.029
<v Regina>Like to protect them from the atmosphere,</v>

488
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:51.209
like we would use a diving suit.

489
00:28:51.209 --> 00:28:55.623
<v ->You see very huge, big eyes sometimes and even</v>

490
00:28:55.623 --> 00:28:59.362
inside of a UFO and some have the form

491
00:28:59.362 --> 00:29:04.223
of flying saucers and you can even see some persons

492
00:29:04.223 --> 00:29:08.657
looking out from some windows around.

493
00:29:08.657 --> 00:29:13.148
So, they are too good and that would be the biggest problem.

494
00:29:15.899 --> 00:29:19.295
I think it takes a long time until we can prove

495
00:29:19.295 --> 00:29:22.916
that these pieces are original and old.

496
00:29:22.916 --> 00:29:27.465
But, for me it would be an explanation where the Mayans

497
00:29:27.465 --> 00:29:32.355
in Central America did get their fantastic knowledge

498
00:29:32.355 --> 00:29:37.305
about astronomy, about mathematic.

499
00:29:37.305 --> 00:29:41.886
And, they had the more precise calendar than we do

500
00:29:41.886 --> 00:29:43.527
in our days.

501
00:29:43.527 --> 00:29:47.596
<v Regina>Yes, I had a chance to interview</v>

502
00:29:48.507 --> 00:29:52.247
Jose Arguelles before he died about this

503
00:29:52.247 --> 00:29:55.906
and what he told me was absolutely fascinating.

504
00:29:55.906 --> 00:30:00.301
And, I think that he felt that his purpose for being born

505
00:30:00.301 --> 00:30:04.002
into this lifetime was to bring that information back

506
00:30:04.002 --> 00:30:07.102
forward again to the best of his own abilities.

507
00:30:07.102 --> 00:30:11.541
And, he had said that the other Gregorian calendar

508
00:30:11.541 --> 00:30:14.441
was an artificial construct that had been introduced

509
00:30:14.441 --> 00:30:17.191
to humanity through some other lineage.

510
00:30:18.101 --> 00:30:20.822
And, I said, "What other lineage, are we talking of maybe

511
00:30:20.822 --> 00:30:22.301
"an off-planet lineage?"

512
00:30:22.301 --> 00:30:23.661
And, he said, "Yes."

513
00:30:23.661 --> 00:30:26.583
And, that particular calendar as opposed to the Mayan

514
00:30:26.583 --> 00:30:30.123
calendar which has that natural kind of cosmic cycles

515
00:30:30.123 --> 00:30:34.483
and rhythms, the other is very unnatural and it takes

516
00:30:34.483 --> 00:30:38.123
people's psyche and just puts it ever so slightly

517
00:30:38.123 --> 00:30:41.803
out of sync with the sense of cycles and time and he felt

518
00:30:41.803 --> 00:30:43.664
that this was very intentional.

519
00:30:43.664 --> 00:30:47.724
And was here to bring back knowledge of the Mayan calendar,

520
00:30:47.724 --> 00:30:51.685
as you say this perfection of the cycles

521
00:30:51.685 --> 00:30:54.764
which puts us back in sync with ourselves, our psyche,

522
00:30:54.764 --> 00:30:56.985
our cosmos, our planet, and everything else

523
00:30:56.985 --> 00:30:59.305
if we looked at time in a new way,

524
00:30:59.305 --> 00:31:02.545
Which all of these pieces come together whether it's you

525
00:31:02.545 --> 00:31:05.125
and Jose and Michael Tellinger's work.

526
00:31:05.125 --> 00:31:06.685
You've been doing a little bit of work

527
00:31:06.685 --> 00:31:08.745
with Michael Tellinger.
<v ->Oh, yeah, oh yeah.</v>

528
00:31:08.745 --> 00:31:11.145
<v Regina>And, those beautiful pieces, we've interviewed</v>

529
00:31:11.145 --> 00:31:13.105
him a couple of times and those beautiful pieces

530
00:31:13.105 --> 00:31:15.785
that are acoustic that he talks about are another kind

531
00:31:15.785 --> 00:31:18.165
of ceramic we don't understand and yet they've been

532
00:31:18.165 --> 00:31:21.285
there for many, many, many thousands of years.

533
00:31:21.285 --> 00:31:24.685
<v ->And, they are very, very old definitely.</v>

534
00:31:24.685 --> 00:31:26.705
<v Regina>Perhaps hundreds of thousands of years old</v>

535
00:31:26.705 --> 00:31:28.365
it's appearing.
<v ->I think so too.</v>

536
00:31:28.365 --> 00:31:31.525
And again, when I was invited three weeks ago

537
00:31:32.486 --> 00:31:37.157
for a conference in Bosnia to the Bosnian Pyramids

538
00:31:38.147 --> 00:31:42.578
I could see also ceramics, bigger than this table

539
00:31:43.368 --> 00:31:48.368
and they look like stone, but they did really scientific

540
00:31:48.388 --> 00:31:52.148
researches on the material and they found out that

541
00:31:52.148 --> 00:31:56.928
it is ceramic and the color of these pieces are equal with

542
00:31:56.928 --> 00:32:01.582
the color of the artifacts from Michael Tellinger.

543
00:32:02.372 --> 00:32:07.164
So, now we are trying really to connect all these places

544
00:32:07.694 --> 00:32:10.715
because, for me, they have a kind of connection.

545
00:32:10.715 --> 00:32:12.535
They are connected.

546
00:32:12.535 --> 00:32:15.215
<v Regina>And, it makes sense if you just look at</v>

547
00:32:15.215 --> 00:32:18.235
what they're saying, it appears that throughout history

548
00:32:18.235 --> 00:32:21.255
there have always been flying machines of some kind.

549
00:32:21.255 --> 00:32:24.976
<v ->You have the Vimanas in the Vedas</v>

550
00:32:24.976 --> 00:32:27.196
and Mahabharata.

551
00:32:27.196 --> 00:32:30.876
And, there's an interesting story that it was mentioned

552
00:32:30.876 --> 00:32:33.924
that they were using, for flying they were using

553
00:32:34.994 --> 00:32:37.054
liquid mercury.

554
00:32:37.054 --> 00:32:38.595
<v Regina>What kind of mercury?</v>

555
00:32:38.595 --> 00:32:40.315
<v ->Liquid.
<v Regina>Oh, liquid mercury.</v>

556
00:32:40.315 --> 00:32:42.435
<v ->Liquid mercury.
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>

557
00:32:42.435 --> 00:32:46.817
<v ->And, in Teotihuacan, in the Mexican</v>

558
00:32:46.817 --> 00:32:51.694
pyramids they found in an underground tunnel

559
00:32:51.694 --> 00:32:56.478
a stone box which was completely filled with liquid mercury.

560
00:32:57.808 --> 00:32:59.368
So, how comes?

561
00:32:59.368 --> 00:33:03.748
And, even the story about the Nazi flying saucers

562
00:33:04.749 --> 00:33:07.789
in the second World War, it's also mentioned

563
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:10.429
that they used mercury.

564
00:33:10.429 --> 00:33:13.789
So, something must be behind that.

565
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:17.069
<v Regina>Yes, and I've heard tales about where some</v>

566
00:33:17.069 --> 00:33:19.309
of that technology had come from, that it had been

567
00:33:19.309 --> 00:33:23.989
reverse engineered technology, prior to World War II,

568
00:33:23.989 --> 00:33:27.309
thus the advance in the space race, really.

569
00:33:27.309 --> 00:33:30.949
And now, so we have these artifacts, I think certainly

570
00:33:30.949 --> 00:33:34.510
we're understanding that these very interesting

571
00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:37.991
and diverse types of species that there has been

572
00:33:37.991 --> 00:33:41.230
no explanation for has been living all around the planet

573
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:44.870
including giants, and there are also tiny, tiny skeletons

574
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:47.010
that have been discovered of tiny, tiny little people

575
00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:49.551
as well, only less than a meter tall.

576
00:33:49.551 --> 00:33:53.490
So, we have very unusual breeds of intelligent life force

577
00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:56.770
that appears to be human, humanoid in a way

578
00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:57.890
around the planet.

579
00:33:57.890 --> 00:34:01.190
And, not only that, but there's been what I think

580
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:04.870
a colleague of yours calls a pre-Sanskrit language

581
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:09.430
that has also evidence has been found of this all over.

582
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:14.172
<v ->We found on stones the same writing from Columbia,</v>

583
00:34:14.842 --> 00:34:17.388
Ecuador, United States,

584
00:34:19.018 --> 00:34:22.618
the famous Burrows Cave in Illinois,

585
00:34:22.618 --> 00:34:26.160
Glozel in France, Malta,

586
00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:30.361
Calabria in Italy, Turkmenistan,

587
00:34:30.361 --> 00:34:32.161
and even Australia.

588
00:34:32.161 --> 00:34:37.022
And, all those writings in each of these countries are not

589
00:34:40.832 --> 00:34:44.911
accepted as original artifacts.

590
00:34:44.911 --> 00:34:48.434
In Glozel the land owner found it

591
00:34:48.434 --> 00:34:52.934
already in 1923, over 300 pieces

592
00:34:52.934 --> 00:34:55.374
with this strange in carvings,

593
00:34:55.374 --> 00:34:59.145
Illinois, Burrow's Cave 1984.

594
00:35:00.774 --> 00:35:05.315
Father Crespi in Ecuador found stones with exactly

595
00:35:05.315 --> 00:35:08.794
the same writing in the so-called Cueva da los Tayos,

596
00:35:08.794 --> 00:35:11.245
a huge underground tunnel system.

597
00:35:12.334 --> 00:35:16.494
And, it's always the same writing, but why it is not

598
00:35:16.494 --> 00:35:20.855
accepted as a original writing

599
00:35:20.855 --> 00:35:24.597
because some of the scientists are saying that this writing

600
00:35:24.597 --> 00:35:29.069
is a mixture of different kind of writings,

601
00:35:30.159 --> 00:35:32.819
like the runes

602
00:35:32.819 --> 00:35:37.781
and the Sumerian writing.
<v Regina>Runes, cuneiform.</v>

603
00:35:37.781 --> 00:35:40.444
<v ->And, there was one man, yeah cuneiform, and there was</v>

604
00:35:40.444 --> 00:35:44.689
one man at the professor the German Linguistics Society

605
00:35:45.599 --> 00:35:49.819
who deciphered, he called it not translated.

606
00:35:49.819 --> 00:35:52.991
He said, "I was able to decipher

607
00:35:55.242 --> 00:35:56.743
these writings."

608
00:35:56.743 --> 00:36:01.023
And, he called it pre-Sanskrit because he said it is older

609
00:36:01.023 --> 00:36:03.563
than the oldest writing.

610
00:36:03.563 --> 00:36:06.943
And he said, "This writing has a connection even to

611
00:36:06.943 --> 00:36:11.383
the Indus Valley, Mohenjo-daro, Harrappa writing

612
00:36:11.383 --> 00:36:14.723
and to the Easter Island writing.

613
00:36:14.723 --> 00:36:18.223
So, that means there must have been a global

614
00:36:18.223 --> 00:36:20.363
civilization once.

615
00:36:20.363 --> 00:36:25.124
And, why they used writing on stones because they knew

616
00:36:25.124 --> 00:36:30.024
if there is a catastrophe happen all the other material

617
00:36:30.024 --> 00:36:33.845
would disappear, but stone would keep it's surface.

618
00:36:33.845 --> 00:36:35.795
(coughs)
Sorry.

619
00:36:35.795 --> 00:36:37.455
<v Regina>That makes sense, because if they were</v>

620
00:36:37.455 --> 00:36:40.155
sophisticated enough to do some of what we're seeing

621
00:36:40.155 --> 00:36:44.535
and to have been interfacing with, if not creating

622
00:36:44.535 --> 00:36:47.575
some of the technology that's being indicated.

623
00:36:47.575 --> 00:36:49.975
(coughs)
<v ->Sorry.</v>

624
00:36:49.975 --> 00:36:52.055
<v Regina>We'll take one moment to do the same thing.</v>

625
00:36:52.055 --> 00:36:56.396
(coughs)
<v ->Okay.</v>

626
00:36:56.396 --> 00:36:57.496
<v Regina>Then--</v>

627
00:36:57.496 --> 00:36:58.588
<v Voiceover>Lost the question.</v>

628
00:36:58.588 --> 00:36:59.478
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

629
00:36:59.478 --> 00:37:01.904
(coughs)

630
00:37:03.714 --> 00:37:05.794
Yes, because if they were sophisticated enough

631
00:37:05.794 --> 00:37:08.934
to have either have been interfacing with or even

632
00:37:08.934 --> 00:37:11.414
creating the kind of technology that's showing up

633
00:37:11.414 --> 00:37:13.894
in some of these artifacts being depicted in it,

634
00:37:13.894 --> 00:37:16.574
which is sophisticated technology including in Egyptian

635
00:37:16.574 --> 00:37:19.254
artifacts they certainly were sophisticated enough

636
00:37:19.254 --> 00:37:23.996
to create paper, or create fabric,

637
00:37:23.996 --> 00:37:26.397
very primitive things and write on that.

638
00:37:26.397 --> 00:37:29.607
But, as you say all of these things have been preserved

639
00:37:29.607 --> 00:37:33.486
in the one thing that lasts for, it has to have been

640
00:37:33.486 --> 00:37:34.887
for the purpose.

641
00:37:34.887 --> 00:37:37.787
<v ->And, they knew, of course they knew that any other</v>

642
00:37:37.787 --> 00:37:41.977
material in thousands of years wouldn't exist anymore.

643
00:37:42.787 --> 00:37:46.848
So, this is a simple talk from

644
00:37:46.848 --> 00:37:50.018
some of the scientists that they say,

645
00:37:50.018 --> 00:37:53.338
"If there was a global civilization

646
00:37:53.338 --> 00:37:58.309
"why did they write so simple letters on stones?"

647
00:37:59.199 --> 00:38:02.701
Exactly because they knew what would happen

648
00:38:02.701 --> 00:38:07.701
if we would have a catastrophe and what would be our--

649
00:38:09.203 --> 00:38:10.803
<v Regina>Legacy?</v>
<v ->Legacy.</v>

650
00:38:10.803 --> 00:38:12.702
<v Regina>Nothing if the grid goes down.</v>

651
00:38:12.702 --> 00:38:13.883
<v ->A DVD?</v>

652
00:38:13.883 --> 00:38:18.083
We have even problem with a 20 years old floppy

653
00:38:18.083 --> 00:38:22.785
to get anything, any place to get this status back.

654
00:38:22.785 --> 00:38:24.404
So, what happens?

655
00:38:24.404 --> 00:38:26.885
And, it would disappear completely.

656
00:38:26.885 --> 00:38:29.405
<v Regina>Yes, and what's interesting is the Mayans</v>

657
00:38:29.405 --> 00:38:32.605
had an innate understanding as going through

658
00:38:32.605 --> 00:38:36.845
and also the Hindu culture, also the Egyptians

659
00:38:36.845 --> 00:38:41.705
of the cycles, well you can go back to the progression

660
00:38:41.705 --> 00:38:45.125
of the equinox, but the cycles of consciousness.

661
00:38:45.125 --> 00:38:47.200
And, that there would be times in history

662
00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.759
where consciousness would go dark

663
00:38:48.759 --> 00:38:50.999
and fall and memory would be gone.

664
00:38:50.999 --> 00:38:52.720
And then, there'd be times when consciousness

665
00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:56.800
of civilizations would rise back up and have the ability,

666
00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:00.179
knowledge, perhaps technology and curiosity to begin

667
00:39:00.179 --> 00:39:01.639
rediscovering these things.

668
00:39:01.639 --> 00:39:04.319
So, the people that created these understood that,

669
00:39:04.319 --> 00:39:06.719
so they must have known that there would be a time,

670
00:39:06.719 --> 00:39:09.760
IE now, that we would be waking back up again

671
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:13.480
and looking for information about our roots as a people

672
00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.710
and civilization, or maybe our place in the cosmos,

673
00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:19.299
as a species.

674
00:39:19.299 --> 00:39:23.420
<v ->And, the strange thing is that especially the last</v>

675
00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:28.380
two, three years more and more strange artifacts

676
00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.952
are coming up to the surface.

677
00:39:32.943 --> 00:39:35.424
There are new findings, of course, through

678
00:39:35.424 --> 00:39:39.325
better technology, of course, but also

679
00:39:39.325 --> 00:39:43.468
in all over the world new, old buildings,

680
00:39:43.468 --> 00:39:47.849
old monuments, old artifacts

681
00:39:47.849 --> 00:39:49.343
were found.

682
00:39:49.343 --> 00:39:54.310
And, I think all the legends have a big

683
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:57.699
quantity on reality and we should follow

684
00:39:57.699 --> 00:39:59.890
more our legends--

685
00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:01.760
<v Regina>Legends, yes.</v>

686
00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:05.140
<v ->Legends of the elders and shamans because there</v>

687
00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:08.479
is a lot to learn from the past and maybe it would

688
00:40:08.479 --> 00:40:11.830
help us to survive in the future.

689
00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.220
<v Regina>Absolutely, and when you're speaking, again,</v>

690
00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:17.561
of these various artifacts that are placed all over

691
00:40:17.561 --> 00:40:20.221
the world and some of which are being rediscovered

692
00:40:20.221 --> 00:40:23.721
we're talking about pyramids, whether they're ziggurats,

693
00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:26.221
step-pyramids, or whether they're smooth-sided pyramids

694
00:40:26.221 --> 00:40:28.361
they're all over the planet.

695
00:40:28.361 --> 00:40:32.711
<v ->Yeah, we even have some pyramids in Austria.</v>

696
00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.941
And now, this Bosnian Pyramid, of course, there are three

697
00:40:36.941 --> 00:40:40.940
mountains, so called mountains, but they did already

698
00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:45.061
excavations on the surface of the so-called Sun pyramid

699
00:40:45.061 --> 00:40:49.821
and they found huge stone blocks and things

700
00:40:49.821 --> 00:40:53.661
which definitely nature is not making.

701
00:40:53.661 --> 00:40:57.280
But then, they had a delegation from Egypt in Bosnia

702
00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:00.580
and these professors--
<v Regina>Egyptologists.</v>

703
00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:04.020
<v ->Said, that this is definitely not a pyramid so they</v>

704
00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:07.860
prohibited to do further excavations

705
00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:12.120
on the surface of the mountain, of the pyramid.

706
00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:15.881
But, they started about two and a half kilometers

707
00:41:15.881 --> 00:41:20.483
away to excavate a huge

708
00:41:20.483 --> 00:41:22.983
underground labyrinth.

709
00:41:22.983 --> 00:41:26.403
And, they found things inside there, I visitied it three

710
00:41:26.403 --> 00:41:28.994
weeks ago, and it's just incredible.

711
00:41:30.544 --> 00:41:34.284
Nobody knows who did it, but approximately

712
00:41:34.284 --> 00:41:38.416
they found some organic material and did age dating.

713
00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:44.060
The age of the building is around

714
00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:46.540
12,350 years.

715
00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:50.560
That would fit again with many legends about the flood

716
00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:55.102
and all these things, and they closed it,

717
00:41:55.102 --> 00:41:58.162
completely the labyrinth, they closed it again.

718
00:41:58.162 --> 00:42:02.782
But, the complete labryinth that means what is inside

719
00:42:02.782 --> 00:42:07.384
so valuable or so important that they even filled

720
00:42:07.384 --> 00:42:11.924
the labyrinth, not doing it, not making it

721
00:42:11.924 --> 00:42:14.524
about 12,350 years ago,

722
00:42:14.524 --> 00:42:18.265
but then closing it and the age of closing

723
00:42:18.265 --> 00:42:20.824
is about 5,000 years ago.

724
00:42:20.824 --> 00:42:25.354
So, that means for over 7,000 years this labyrinth

725
00:42:25.354 --> 00:42:27.633
must have had a function.

726
00:42:27.633 --> 00:42:31.773
And, what was for me very exciting

727
00:42:31.773 --> 00:42:34.734
is that they opened until now

728
00:42:34.734 --> 00:42:39.115
about 260 meters of the tunnel

729
00:42:39.115 --> 00:42:43.055
and even you are at the end of the tunnel

730
00:42:43.055 --> 00:42:46.414
there's completely fresh air, the same temperature

731
00:42:46.414 --> 00:42:48.417
12 degrees Celcius.

732
00:42:49.427 --> 00:42:53.877
And, there are no bacteria, there is completely no radiation

733
00:42:53.877 --> 00:42:55.790
inside the tunnel system.

734
00:42:56.857 --> 00:42:59.370
<v Regina>Which, that's not normal at all.</v>

735
00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:01.110
<v ->That's not normal at all.</v>

736
00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:02.469
<v Regina>To have no radiation.</v>

737
00:43:02.469 --> 00:43:05.369
<v ->Completely no radiation inside, they did measurements,</v>

738
00:43:05.369 --> 00:43:06.549
everything.

739
00:43:06.549 --> 00:43:10.749
And, they have up to 40 times more negative ions

740
00:43:10.749 --> 00:43:15.521
than in a very good ion sated room?

741
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:18.170
<v Regina>Oh saturated, a room saturated with</v>

742
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:19.310
negative ions.

743
00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:23.850
<v ->And, I spent over one hour with some friends inside</v>

744
00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:27.891
one of the small rooms there and even they closed

745
00:43:27.891 --> 00:43:30.831
the light so you have a completely darkness, you have

746
00:43:30.831 --> 00:43:35.807
a completely silence and when I left this labyrinth

747
00:43:36.756 --> 00:43:41.496
I was so energized I thought it's the same I could have had

748
00:43:41.496 --> 00:43:43.758
14 days really holiday.

749
00:43:43.758 --> 00:43:45.778
<v Regina>Oh, it sounds sublime.</v>

750
00:43:45.778 --> 00:43:49.797
So, it could have had to do with healing, a regeneration,

751
00:43:49.797 --> 00:43:51.237
rejuvenation.

752
00:43:51.237 --> 00:43:53.918
<v ->Yeah, but still there must be something else</v>

753
00:43:53.918 --> 00:43:58.508
and they did even special sound recording

754
00:43:59.579 --> 00:44:04.530
and when they changed it that it was possible to hear.

755
00:44:07.603 --> 00:44:11.103
They played it, the professors, in the conference

756
00:44:11.103 --> 00:44:15.883
and it's amazing because you have a sound like an engine

757
00:44:15.883 --> 00:44:17.224
is running.

758
00:44:17.224 --> 00:44:21.706
And, when I spoke with Nassim Haramein a few days ago

759
00:44:21.706 --> 00:44:26.028
and I explained him this he sent me two MP3

760
00:44:26.028 --> 00:44:30.248
files one of the sound of the sun

761
00:44:30.248 --> 00:44:33.507
and one the sound of a UFO.

762
00:44:33.507 --> 00:44:37.927
And, strange that the sound is

763
00:44:37.927 --> 00:44:40.508
very similar so there must be

764
00:44:40.508 --> 00:44:44.749
something inside this tunnel system,

765
00:44:44.749 --> 00:44:48.083
or the pyramid or whatsoever, but I'm quite sure

766
00:44:48.083 --> 00:44:50.903
because why did they close it completely

767
00:44:50.903 --> 00:44:54.022
the labyrinth of 5,000 years ago.

768
00:44:54.022 --> 00:44:57.162
<v Regina>Indeed, and in fact, we were having a little</v>

769
00:44:57.162 --> 00:45:00.502
Viennese cake and coffee yesterday at a little coffee house

770
00:45:00.502 --> 00:45:04.043
talking and you imitated the sound that you heard

771
00:45:04.043 --> 00:45:06.983
and when you were doing that I thought, "Ah,"

772
00:45:06.983 --> 00:45:11.557
and I have an audio tape

773
00:45:12.307 --> 00:45:14.667
that was also given to me about 10 years ago

774
00:45:14.667 --> 00:45:16.427
from two people who had recorded

775
00:45:16.427 --> 00:45:20.047
the sound of a UFO and it was the same sound

776
00:45:20.047 --> 00:45:21.607
you were making.

777
00:45:22.867 --> 00:45:25.727
<v ->And again, the connection between the pieces</v>

778
00:45:25.727 --> 00:45:29.516
and the labyrinth and the energy and the sound

779
00:45:29.516 --> 00:45:33.215
because they did even measurement on top of the pyramid

780
00:45:33.215 --> 00:45:37.396
in Bosnia and they found out that there's a strong energy

781
00:45:37.396 --> 00:45:41.776
going straight up into the sky from the top of the pyramid.

782
00:45:41.776 --> 00:45:45.576
And, that remembered me immediately with the researches

783
00:45:45.576 --> 00:45:49.808
of Michael Tellinger of the stone circles in South Africa

784
00:45:50.538 --> 00:45:52.403
that they also produce sound, they also produce--

785
00:45:52.403 --> 00:45:54.163
<v Regina>Like standing waves, yeah waveforms.</v>

786
00:45:54.163 --> 00:45:56.212
<v ->Standing waves and everything.</v>

787
00:45:56.212 --> 00:45:58.992
So, was that the same civilization?

788
00:45:58.992 --> 00:46:02.731
That's again a big question, and it's interesting to trying

789
00:46:02.731 --> 00:46:05.352
to find out a real good answer.

790
00:46:05.352 --> 00:46:07.592
<v Regina>And, if the technology and means were there</v>

791
00:46:07.592 --> 00:46:10.172
we'd probably find these exist again in other places

792
00:46:10.172 --> 00:46:14.531
as well most likely, more than just two isolated places

793
00:46:14.531 --> 00:46:18.332
on the planet given everything else that you're finding.

794
00:46:18.332 --> 00:46:22.072
And, you know, it's interesting too is some of the,

795
00:46:22.072 --> 00:46:24.151
again I'm encouraging people to get the DVD

796
00:46:24.151 --> 00:46:27.792
because you have to see all of these incredible artifacts,

797
00:46:27.792 --> 00:46:29.692
some of which you're going to gather together to do

798
00:46:29.692 --> 00:46:34.393
an exhibition in 2012, but the quality

799
00:46:34.393 --> 00:46:37.433
of workmanship on some of these pieces,

800
00:46:37.433 --> 00:46:40.193
and especially the collection that has the little

801
00:46:40.193 --> 00:46:43.273
constellations and eyes when you place them

802
00:46:43.273 --> 00:46:46.174
under a black light these things glow.

803
00:46:46.174 --> 00:46:48.813
You couldn't see that, you would pick up the stone

804
00:46:48.813 --> 00:46:51.533
and you would see that, but why something that glows

805
00:46:51.533 --> 00:46:53.953
under a black light when there were no black lights

806
00:46:53.953 --> 00:46:56.214
thousands, or tens of thousands of years ago.

807
00:46:56.214 --> 00:46:57.493
What were they doing?

808
00:46:57.493 --> 00:47:01.374
<v ->That's what we know, I always say "That's what we know."</v>

809
00:47:01.374 --> 00:47:03.194
<v Regina>Yeah, supposedly.</v>

810
00:47:03.194 --> 00:47:08.179
<v ->If they had already technology which we do not have today</v>

811
00:47:08.179 --> 00:47:12.382
like producing sound waves, producing energy,

812
00:47:12.382 --> 00:47:15.002
we are not able to do that today.

813
00:47:15.002 --> 00:47:17.336
<v Regina>And, those may have glowed from within,</v>

814
00:47:18.364 --> 00:47:20.946
in that energy field and that's why they use those

815
00:47:20.946 --> 00:47:24.406
incredible ceramics with this brilliant constellations

816
00:47:24.406 --> 00:47:25.885
and eyes shining.

817
00:47:25.885 --> 00:47:28.525
<v ->That's another possibility.
<v Regina>Yeah, absolutely.</v>

818
00:47:28.525 --> 00:47:32.289
<v ->I mean, we just learned that</v>

819
00:47:32.289 --> 00:47:36.915
our ancestors they were wild people,

820
00:47:36.915 --> 00:47:38.815
they didn't know anything.

821
00:47:38.815 --> 00:47:42.975
Our oldest civilizations are going back around 6,000 years.

822
00:47:42.975 --> 00:47:47.495
But, there are so many pieces like also Michael Cremo

823
00:47:47.495 --> 00:47:49.495
wrote in his book.

824
00:47:49.495 --> 00:47:50.875
<v Regina>Forbidden Archeology.</v>

825
00:47:50.875 --> 00:47:52.035
<v ->He did good research.</v>

826
00:47:52.035 --> 00:47:54.655
We are going back millions, and millions, and millions

827
00:47:54.655 --> 00:47:58.394
of years like in Columbia in close to

828
00:47:58.394 --> 00:48:03.235
Villa de Leyva they found cultivated

829
00:48:03.235 --> 00:48:06.335
fruits and vegetables petrified

830
00:48:06.335 --> 00:48:10.274
in an area where you only find fossils.

831
00:48:10.274 --> 00:48:14.115
And, the age of the fossils from this area goes back

832
00:48:14.115 --> 00:48:17.714
around 120, 140 million years.

833
00:48:17.714 --> 00:48:21.581
And, they also found a human hand and a human foot

834
00:48:21.581 --> 00:48:24.782
skeleton petrified in a stone plate.

835
00:48:24.782 --> 00:48:29.551
Age dating geological-wise is about 120 to 140 million years

836
00:48:29.551 --> 00:48:33.434
so why these pieces cannot be accepted as

837
00:48:33.434 --> 00:48:37.477
reality because it would open

838
00:48:37.477 --> 00:48:42.460
a missing link of over 120 million years

839
00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:43.792
of history.

840
00:48:43.792 --> 00:48:48.212
So, we are here on 6,000 years and we have a missing

841
00:48:48.212 --> 00:48:52.321
link up to 120 and even more million years.

842
00:48:52.321 --> 00:48:54.923
What happened in between?

843
00:48:54.923 --> 00:48:57.349
<v Regina>And some say, even Cremo, into the billions</v>

844
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:58.549
of years perhaps.

845
00:48:58.549 --> 00:49:02.290
<v ->Right, like the South African spheres they found.</v>

846
00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:05.650
So, there's too much and I think why the Mayans

847
00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:09.449
and the Aztecs have their legend of the four times

848
00:49:09.449 --> 00:49:14.010
the Earth had a big global catastrophe and now we are

849
00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:18.289
going into the fifth and the ending of the Mayan calendar,

850
00:49:18.289 --> 00:49:22.310
I'm not afraid that world will disappear in 2012

851
00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:26.550
because my planning is already 2014 and still

852
00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:28.989
we have to do a lot more.

853
00:49:28.989 --> 00:49:32.469
But, something will happen I think.

854
00:49:32.469 --> 00:49:36.249
<v Regina>Well, we're obviously in a very sped up</v>

855
00:49:36.249 --> 00:49:40.339
period of time, everybody can even feel just on a physical

856
00:49:40.339 --> 00:49:42.900
level time is speeding up, knowledge is pouring to

857
00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:46.380
the forefront at an incredible rate, changes within

858
00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.170
the Earth itself.

859
00:49:49.581 --> 00:49:52.102
The expressions of this, whether it be tsunamis,

860
00:49:52.102 --> 00:49:55.681
earthquakes, everything is becoming more saturated and I

861
00:49:55.681 --> 00:49:58.422
think that that intensification will certainly keep up.

862
00:49:58.422 --> 00:50:01.042
To what end, no one really, truly knows.

863
00:50:01.042 --> 00:50:03.167
We don't know the degree to which the earth is going to

864
00:50:03.167 --> 00:50:05.828
shake herself up here, but we do know that we are being

865
00:50:05.828 --> 00:50:09.900
given incredible keys and clues to our past right now.

866
00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:14.721
That really, we're at a time we can

867
00:50:15.371 --> 00:50:18.711
no longer afford the luxury of waiting

868
00:50:18.711 --> 00:50:21.431
for the scientific community to catch up

869
00:50:21.431 --> 00:50:23.291
with what's being presented,

870
00:50:23.291 --> 00:50:25.471
which creates some problems.

871
00:50:25.471 --> 00:50:28.771
Speculation can be wild and off the charts,

872
00:50:28.771 --> 00:50:30.731
at the same time if we're going to wait for

873
00:50:30.731 --> 00:50:34.402
the scientific community to give this their blessing.

874
00:50:36.171 --> 00:50:40.072
<v ->I think the most important, for me, is we can learn</v>

875
00:50:40.072 --> 00:50:44.171
so much from these researches which might

876
00:50:44.171 --> 00:50:47.833
help us to change our life because we have to

877
00:50:47.833 --> 00:50:48.993
change our life.

878
00:50:48.993 --> 00:50:53.691
If we continue like we do today we are one day blamed

879
00:50:53.691 --> 00:50:57.842
by our children and grandchildren what we have done

880
00:50:57.842 --> 00:51:01.535
because look, wide catastrophe,

881
00:51:02.685 --> 00:51:04.445
atomic catastrophes.

882
00:51:04.445 --> 00:51:08.445
We destroy our Earth by ourselves, and maybe it happened

883
00:51:08.445 --> 00:51:10.465
already several times.

884
00:51:10.465 --> 00:51:14.505
So, let's study old history, really old history

885
00:51:14.505 --> 00:51:18.465
in cooperation with scientists, because I always say

886
00:51:18.465 --> 00:51:20.565
I'm not a scientist.

887
00:51:20.565 --> 00:51:24.144
I would need information, I would not like to fight

888
00:51:24.144 --> 00:51:25.304
against the scientists.

889
00:51:25.304 --> 00:51:26.784
<v Regina>No.</v>
<v ->No.</v>

890
00:51:26.784 --> 00:51:31.171
Ask them help, let's try

891
00:51:31.171 --> 00:51:35.711
to find together an answer on so many questions.

892
00:51:35.711 --> 00:51:37.970
<v Regina>And, there are some very brave scientists</v>

893
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:41.811
that are willing to risk their tenure, risk their funding,

894
00:51:41.811 --> 00:51:44.751
risk everything to go into these areas.

895
00:51:44.751 --> 00:51:48.791
And, I so admire and respect the ones who are willing

896
00:51:48.791 --> 00:51:52.751
to really take a new look at these artifacts rather than

897
00:51:52.751 --> 00:51:56.791
trying to deny it because it goes against the prevailing

898
00:51:56.791 --> 00:51:58.251
theories of the day.

899
00:51:59.552 --> 00:52:03.032
So, for you what do you think has been since sitting

900
00:52:03.032 --> 00:52:07.032
in those hotel rooms looking at these various art exhibits

901
00:52:07.032 --> 00:52:11.511
and artifacts that were inexplicable in the early days

902
00:52:11.511 --> 00:52:15.272
to today, what do you think on a personal level has been

903
00:52:15.272 --> 00:52:17.412
catapulting you, driving you, 'cause you're stubborn.

904
00:52:17.412 --> 00:52:19.972
You're going to make this stuff happen.

905
00:52:19.972 --> 00:52:21.801
What's been driving you forward?

906
00:52:23.972 --> 00:52:26.673
<v ->First of all that I found out that our history</v>

907
00:52:26.673 --> 00:52:28.424
is completely different.

908
00:52:29.174 --> 00:52:31.414
I found the approval.

909
00:52:31.414 --> 00:52:36.034
And second, at the time when I started the idea of making

910
00:52:36.034 --> 00:52:39.545
the first exhibition with such objects

911
00:52:40.916 --> 00:52:44.257
I always said, leave me alone with the esoteric people

912
00:52:44.257 --> 00:52:47.327
because they are all flying on a pink cloud.

913
00:52:48.436 --> 00:52:52.476
But then, on my trips to South America and later on

914
00:52:52.476 --> 00:52:57.236
to other countries also, but especially in South America

915
00:52:57.236 --> 00:53:02.177
I had so strange experiences that still

916
00:53:02.177 --> 00:53:05.318
I don't have an explanation but it showed me

917
00:53:05.318 --> 00:53:08.658
that there is so much between sky and Earth

918
00:53:08.658 --> 00:53:10.518
we do not know.

919
00:53:10.518 --> 00:53:15.458
So, I also changed completely and I take these things

920
00:53:15.458 --> 00:53:18.679
now much more serious than I did before.

921
00:53:18.679 --> 00:53:21.330
<v Regina>Congratulations, because I'm walking between</v>

922
00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:23.810
both of those worlds all the time and I'm comfortable

923
00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:26.671
with both of those worlds and I love the esoteric part

924
00:53:26.671 --> 00:53:29.230
of our own beings that we can tap into.

925
00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:31.531
So, I'm happy that you're getting comfortable with

926
00:53:31.531 --> 00:53:33.811
the fact that we may have more dimensions than

927
00:53:33.811 --> 00:53:35.651
what is obvious to us.

928
00:53:35.651 --> 00:53:37.651
And, it's certainly as you say, the proof is there

929
00:53:37.651 --> 00:53:41.551
what we see sitting here wasn't as simple as the stories

930
00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:44.631
that are being giving to us either through creationism,

931
00:53:44.631 --> 00:53:46.431
nor through evolution.

932
00:53:46.431 --> 00:53:50.311
However, all of these may have some kind of piece

933
00:53:50.311 --> 00:53:52.351
in one of these puzzles.

934
00:53:52.351 --> 00:53:53.491
<v ->Yeah.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

935
00:53:53.491 --> 00:53:55.101
Any final thoughts?

936
00:53:57.472 --> 00:54:00.912
<v ->Hoping for a good future for all of us.</v>

937
00:54:00.912 --> 00:54:03.932
<v Regina>Me too, and I wanna thank you so much for</v>

938
00:54:03.932 --> 00:54:07.972
taking your will and determination, time, and you're

939
00:54:07.972 --> 00:54:12.152
so meticulous in what you do to bring all of this together

940
00:54:12.152 --> 00:54:15.392
because it really takes physical evidence.

941
00:54:15.392 --> 00:54:17.432
It does take physical evidence and you're the one,

942
00:54:17.432 --> 00:54:19.552
you have connections all over the world now.

943
00:54:19.552 --> 00:54:21.892
You're one of the primary people that is bringing

944
00:54:21.892 --> 00:54:24.532
all of this and amassing it together.

945
00:54:24.532 --> 00:54:28.011
And, that's a lot of will, it's tedious.

946
00:54:28.011 --> 00:54:29.771
You have to deal with governments of the world

947
00:54:29.771 --> 00:54:31.792
and permissions to be able to bring this out

948
00:54:31.792 --> 00:54:34.072
and gather it together even here in Europe

949
00:54:34.072 --> 00:54:35.532
for people to see.

950
00:54:35.532 --> 00:54:38.292
<v ->It's really hard, I can say, yeah.</v>

951
00:54:38.292 --> 00:54:41.032
<v Regina>I appreciate that you're literally spending your</v>

952
00:54:41.032 --> 00:54:44.613
life's work and life's force and your mind doing this

953
00:54:44.613 --> 00:54:47.273
and thank you on behalf of all of us.

954
00:54:47.273 --> 00:54:51.143
<v ->Thank you, thank you very much for coming to Vienna.</v>

955
00:54:53.953 --> 00:54:57.073
<v ->To keep abreast of Klaus' work and upcoming exhibition</v>

956
00:54:57.073 --> 00:55:00.513
you can go to unsolved-mysteries.info.

957
00:55:00.513 --> 00:55:03.513
You can also order his DVD or look at photos of some

958
00:55:03.513 --> 00:55:06.193
of these startling artifacts via this website.

959
00:55:06.193 --> 00:55:08.313
I've learned that Klaus may have some even more profound

960
00:55:08.313 --> 00:55:10.573
discoveries in the not too distant future.

961
00:55:10.573 --> 00:55:12.813
So, you'll wanna check in with him from time to time

962
00:55:12.813 --> 00:55:13.893
as will we.

963
00:55:13.893 --> 00:55:16.464
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

964
00:55:17.354 --> 00:55:21.644
(mellow music)
