00:00:00.645 --> 00:00:03.366
<v ->Everywhere I go I hear the same thing,</v>

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.561
that the medical model we've been operating under

3
00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:08.060
for the last several decades is all but dead,

4
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.762
giving way to what is called energy healing.

5
00:00:10.762 --> 00:00:13.444
The field of energy healing is an expansive one,

6
00:00:13.444 --> 00:00:16.227
but each modality has one thing in common.

7
00:00:16.227 --> 00:00:18.260
They work with the natural healing energys

8
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.718
already built into the human body and brain

9
00:00:20.718 --> 00:00:23.603
via the mind body quantum connection.

10
00:00:23.603 --> 00:00:26.142
Leslie Feinberg, who is one of the great pioneers

11
00:00:26.142 --> 00:00:30.186
in this field, has evolved from chiropractic and kinesiology

12
00:00:30.186 --> 00:00:32.563
into an extremely efficient and direct means

13
00:00:32.563 --> 00:00:35.792
of getting a body to agree to, and thus jumpstart

14
00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:37.439
the healing process.

15
00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:40.446
His healing modality is known as NMT,

16
00:00:40.446 --> 00:00:42.625
The Feinberg technique.

17
00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:53.373
<v Voiceover>First of all, Leslie, if you can explain</v>

18
00:00:53.373 --> 00:00:55.832
what is NMT?

19
00:00:56.434 --> 00:00:59.137
<v ->Well, Neurology Modulation Technique</v>

20
00:00:59.137 --> 00:01:01.637
is a method of healing.

21
00:01:01.637 --> 00:01:05.598
It's really a method of inducing the healing process,

22
00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:09.316
which is an innate quality of all living things,

23
00:01:09.316 --> 00:01:11.611
but sometimes it becomes blocked.

24
00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:15.796
So, it's a method that allows us to identify

25
00:01:15.796 --> 00:01:18.580
what the factors are that are blocking healing,

26
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.141
and to make corrections so that healing

27
00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:23.659
can ensue the way it was designed to.

28
00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.550
<v Voiceover>And you actually liken our nervous system</v>

29
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.247
to a bio computer that can be de-bugged.

30
00:01:30.177 --> 00:01:31.340
<v ->Exactly.
<v Voiceover>In a sense.</v>

31
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.376
<v ->Exactly.
<v Voiceover>So in a sense,</v>

32
00:01:32.376 --> 00:01:34.447
most people here are on their computer.

33
00:01:34.447 --> 00:01:36.621
In fact, almost everybody watching right now,

34
00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:38.450
is on their computer, and we can understand

35
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.853
the notion of de-bugging.

36
00:01:39.853 --> 00:01:43.143
Can you get into some of those computer analogies

37
00:01:43.143 --> 00:01:45.419
a little bit, to help progress what's going on here?

38
00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:46.212
<v ->I can.</v>

39
00:01:46.212 --> 00:01:47.858
Think about it this way,

40
00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:50.843
that, if a person is perfectly well,

41
00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:52.408
if they're deathly ill,

42
00:01:52.408 --> 00:01:54.359
or if they're somewhere in between.

43
00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:57.467
Whatever the state of their health,

44
00:01:57.467 --> 00:02:00.962
we can consider that the physical manifestation

45
00:02:00.962 --> 00:02:05.086
of some set of instructions in the organism.

46
00:02:05.086 --> 00:02:08.623
And wellness implies that those instructions

47
00:02:08.623 --> 00:02:10.694
are just what they ought to be.

48
00:02:10.694 --> 00:02:12.888
And the illness implies that there's some error

49
00:02:12.888 --> 00:02:15.102
within those instructions.

50
00:02:15.102 --> 00:02:18.719
Now, the interesting thing about our consciousness,

51
00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.294
and this is a method of consciousness medicine, is this.

52
00:02:22.294 --> 00:02:25.079
That consciousness is very much like an iceberg,

53
00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.012
if you will.

54
00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:30.035
You know, 90% of an iceberg is under the water line.

55
00:02:30.035 --> 00:02:32.371
Only 10% sticks above.

56
00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:36.353
And our conscious mind, the part that we're aware of

57
00:02:36.353 --> 00:02:39.685
and we can introspect with, is that 10%.

58
00:02:39.685 --> 00:02:43.485
But the vast majority of neurological processing

59
00:02:43.485 --> 00:02:46.532
really happens at a sub-conscious level.

60
00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:48.707
And that's the level that we address

61
00:02:48.707 --> 00:02:50.393
with Neurological Modulation Technique

62
00:02:50.393 --> 00:02:53.847
because that's the level that regulates body function.

63
00:02:54.417 --> 00:02:59.217
So we apply a system of queries

64
00:02:59.217 --> 00:03:01.690
and corrective statements

65
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.904
that are fashioned around a particular window

66
00:03:03.904 --> 00:03:05.387
of physiology.

67
00:03:05.387 --> 00:03:09.207
For instance, we might evaluate neuromuscular skeletal

68
00:03:09.207 --> 00:03:09.999
function.

69
00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:12.519
Or we might evaluate allergy.

70
00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.871
Or we might evaluate some other function of the body,

71
00:03:15.871 --> 00:03:19.019
and identify where the errors are that are keeping the body

72
00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.149
from expressing normal physiology in that area

73
00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:26.008
and make corrections within that information system

74
00:03:26.008 --> 00:03:28.263
so that normal process can unfold

75
00:03:28.263 --> 00:03:30.173
and the healing can ensue.

76
00:03:30.173 --> 00:03:32.855
<v Voiceover>Now you're doing this through consciousness,</v>

77
00:03:32.855 --> 00:03:36.817
intention, language, and protocols, I understand.

78
00:03:36.817 --> 00:03:40.758
I mean, it's not like you have any modalities,

79
00:03:40.758 --> 00:03:42.384
physical modalities you're working with.

80
00:03:42.384 --> 00:03:43.583
You're really going direct.

81
00:03:43.583 --> 00:03:45.614
Pure consciousness and language.

82
00:03:45.614 --> 00:03:46.692
<v ->It's true.</v>

83
00:03:46.692 --> 00:03:49.393
You know, one of the things that I realized

84
00:03:49.393 --> 00:03:52.506
as a result of my studies was that

85
00:03:53.006 --> 00:03:56.565
everything that falls into the category of energetic

86
00:03:56.565 --> 00:03:59.572
medicine is really consciousness medicine.

87
00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:02.558
It's really informational medicine.

88
00:04:02.558 --> 00:04:04.123
To give you an example of that,

89
00:04:04.123 --> 00:04:07.435
if you went to see a Native American Shaman.

90
00:04:07.435 --> 00:04:10.279
And in the course of working with you

91
00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:13.774
they dawned a mask of some power animal

92
00:04:13.774 --> 00:04:18.209
or they brushed you with evil feathers,

93
00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.805
they did chants.

94
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.054
You might, on one level, look at that and say,

95
00:04:24.054 --> 00:04:25.740
"What is that some sort of magic or something?"

96
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.504
But on another level you have to realize that

97
00:04:28.504 --> 00:04:30.008
those procedures and those props

98
00:04:30.008 --> 00:04:31.998
that are used by a Shaman

99
00:04:31.998 --> 00:04:35.839
really constitute a body of meaning and significance

100
00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:38.499
that is exchanged with the subject

101
00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:40.186
in order to make a correction

102
00:04:40.186 --> 00:04:43.829
and reset the system into a healing mode.

103
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.703
If you think about going to an acupuncturist,

104
00:04:47.703 --> 00:04:51.482
an acupuncturist will tell you that when they're trained to

105
00:04:52.352 --> 00:04:54.814
insert the needles that they insert into the

106
00:04:54.814 --> 00:04:56.175
acupuncture meridians,

107
00:04:56.175 --> 00:05:00.549
that there's always a particular intention

108
00:05:00.624 --> 00:05:03.556
that is held as they insert those needles.

109
00:05:03.917 --> 00:05:06.415
So really, all of these methods

110
00:05:06.415 --> 00:05:10.200
of energetic medicine are about information.

111
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.407
And, that being the case, I thought,

112
00:05:14.684 --> 00:05:17.056
why not use the most powerful metaphorical system

113
00:05:17.056 --> 00:05:19.616
that humans have ever developed,

114
00:05:19.616 --> 00:05:20.896
which is language.

115
00:05:20.896 --> 00:05:24.411
And it gives us a power to do a thorough investigation

116
00:05:24.411 --> 00:05:28.745
and to make corrections in a

117
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.539
broad array of categories of health issues.

118
00:05:33.778 --> 00:05:36.052
<v Voiceover>And we have to look at all of the newer</v>

119
00:05:36.052 --> 00:05:38.226
sciences and biology of belief, Bruce Lipton,

120
00:05:38.226 --> 00:05:40.177
and many others that are looking at

121
00:05:40.177 --> 00:05:44.099
the incredible intelligence of individual cells.

122
00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.024
Not just collectively, but as individual cells,

123
00:05:47.024 --> 00:05:49.909
universes, intelligence, forces unto themselves.

124
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:52.794
So of course it would seem communication is everything,

125
00:05:52.794 --> 00:05:55.516
how these cells communicate with each other,

126
00:05:55.516 --> 00:05:58.442
would have to be the building block of all health and life.

127
00:05:58.442 --> 00:06:00.515
So if they're not speaking to each other,

128
00:06:00.515 --> 00:06:03.419
you have wars going on between one type of cell

129
00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.676
versus another, we have problems.

130
00:06:05.676 --> 00:06:08.986
So let's go now, back to say, chiropractic,

131
00:06:08.986 --> 00:06:12.705
where we are beginning to work with energy,

132
00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:14.736
skeletal movement, and so forth,

133
00:06:14.736 --> 00:06:17.255
and progress that forward to how you ended up

134
00:06:17.255 --> 00:06:18.699
where you ended up.

135
00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:20.365
I know it's a long story, but kind of,

136
00:06:20.365 --> 00:06:21.969
if you can hopscotch through it a bit,

137
00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:23.067
that would be great.

138
00:06:23.067 --> 00:06:25.565
<v ->Well you know, my training as a chiropractor</v>

139
00:06:25.565 --> 00:06:28.369
involved the basic theory of chiropractic,

140
00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:33.326
which is that illness happens as a result of blockage

141
00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:35.521
of nerve energy.

142
00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:40.423
And we broadened that to recognize that

143
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.911
health ensues as a result of the unfolding

144
00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:46.471
of a set of information within the system.

145
00:06:46.471 --> 00:06:49.112
That it's not just a matter of pressing against nerves,

146
00:06:49.112 --> 00:06:52.262
but something that the founder of chiropractic,

147
00:06:52.262 --> 00:06:56.656
D.D. Palmer referred to as quality interference.

148
00:06:56.813 --> 00:06:59.372
That is, at a central nervous system level,

149
00:06:59.372 --> 00:07:03.417
the computations and the information processing

150
00:07:03.417 --> 00:07:06.808
that determine physiology has been somehow corrupted

151
00:07:06.808 --> 00:07:07.906
of confused.

152
00:07:07.906 --> 00:07:09.268
<v Voiceover>Almost like broken links?</v>

153
00:07:09.268 --> 00:07:11.427
<v ->Almost like broken links.</v>

154
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.500
So, for instance, within the realm of say, allergy,

155
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.794
if we look at the allergy situation, what is that?

156
00:07:20.808 --> 00:07:25.115
Well, in an allergy situation you find that particular

157
00:07:25.115 --> 00:07:28.974
person is responding to something that 99%

158
00:07:28.974 --> 00:07:33.221
of the population would find to be beneficial.

159
00:07:33.221 --> 00:07:36.295
Or at least, not toxic.

160
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.117
But in a person who has an allergy

161
00:07:38.117 --> 00:07:40.961
there are errors within their informational system

162
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:43.488
that cause confusion.

163
00:07:43.665 --> 00:07:46.488
And inappropriate responses of the immune system,

164
00:07:46.488 --> 00:07:48.662
so that inflammation results.

165
00:07:48.662 --> 00:07:51.993
And so what we do is

166
00:07:51.993 --> 00:07:54.655
we engage the mind, body, and the dialogue,

167
00:07:54.655 --> 00:07:58.942
the therapeutic dialogue, to train the mind body

168
00:07:58.942 --> 00:08:01.686
into an awareness of those things to which

169
00:08:01.686 --> 00:08:05.566
it's making an inappropriate immune system response

170
00:08:05.566 --> 00:08:08.857
to identify the informational errors that are responsible

171
00:08:08.857 --> 00:08:10.198
for it.

172
00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:13.062
To correct the labeling, if you will,

173
00:08:13.062 --> 00:08:15.522
that the particular chemicals or substances

174
00:08:15.522 --> 00:08:19.834
have triggered the allergy response, or provoked by,

175
00:08:21.372 --> 00:08:25.950
to recognize the distinction between that thing

176
00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:27.935
that's behaving as an allergen,

177
00:08:27.935 --> 00:08:31.355
and those substances that comprise body,

178
00:08:31.896 --> 00:08:34.904
to recognize where information within the system

179
00:08:34.904 --> 00:08:37.747
has been co-mingled in a way that causes

180
00:08:37.747 --> 00:08:39.779
an autoimmune response.

181
00:08:39.779 --> 00:08:43.030
And those steps then, comprise what we call

182
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.549
an NMT clinical pathway.

183
00:08:45.549 --> 00:08:47.866
That is, a set of query statements

184
00:08:47.866 --> 00:08:49.451
and instructional statements,

185
00:08:49.451 --> 00:08:51.320
to identify and then to correct

186
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.346
the confusion that causes the allergy situation.

187
00:08:54.346 --> 00:08:57.475
<v Voiceover>Where do emotions figure into this?</v>

188
00:08:57.475 --> 00:09:01.316
Because my understanding is that often emotion,

189
00:09:01.316 --> 00:09:05.176
allergies for example, can have their original

190
00:09:05.176 --> 00:09:09.417
inspiration or onset through emotional events

191
00:09:09.417 --> 00:09:13.282
coupled with whatever the other type of allergen

192
00:09:13.282 --> 00:09:16.736
you know, present at that time was.

193
00:09:16.736 --> 00:09:19.682
So in all of this, where do emotions figure in?

194
00:09:19.682 --> 00:09:22.059
When you're looking at that clinical analysis.

195
00:09:22.059 --> 00:09:24.782
<v ->I think it's a good idea to talk about what emotions are.</v>

196
00:09:24.782 --> 00:09:25.737
<v Voiceover>Mm-hmm, very good.</v>

197
00:09:25.737 --> 00:09:28.053
<v ->And we all talk about emotions, and sometimes</v>

198
00:09:28.053 --> 00:09:31.811
we really don't parse it out as far as

199
00:09:31.811 --> 00:09:34.432
has deciding what they really are.

200
00:09:34.432 --> 00:09:37.057
And from the NMT point of view,

201
00:09:37.057 --> 00:09:40.344
emotions comprise the language,

202
00:09:40.344 --> 00:09:42.335
by which the other than conscious mind,

203
00:09:42.335 --> 00:09:45.505
that vast majority of the nervous system

204
00:09:45.505 --> 00:09:49.447
speaks to and compels the conscious mind

205
00:09:49.447 --> 00:09:51.783
to do that which is necessary for their survival

206
00:09:51.783 --> 00:09:53.759
of the organism.

207
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.756
So we don't look at the issue

208
00:09:57.756 --> 00:09:59.584
as good emotions, or bad emotions,

209
00:09:59.584 --> 00:10:01.839
but only emotions that are appropriate

210
00:10:01.839 --> 00:10:04.582
and contemporaneous to the current situation.

211
00:10:04.582 --> 00:10:06.960
<v Voiceover>Give us examples of a,</v>

212
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.682
what we would classically call a good emotion,

213
00:10:09.682 --> 00:10:12.080
and the outcome in terms of its physiological

214
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.092
effect on the body, versus a negative one.

215
00:10:14.092 --> 00:10:17.332
So we're really clear on what you're talking about. here

216
00:10:17.332 --> 00:10:17.870
<v ->Sure.</v>

217
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:21.040
We might call happiness, and joy, a good emotion.

218
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.513
We might call fear and anger a bad emotion.

219
00:10:24.513 --> 00:10:26.749
But you have to look at the context.

220
00:10:26.749 --> 00:10:29.003
So, if you're walking down the street

221
00:10:29.003 --> 00:10:30.832
and all of a sudden you realize that a tiger

222
00:10:30.832 --> 00:10:33.412
is chasing you.
<v Voiceover>Stalking you.</v>

223
00:10:33.412 --> 00:10:35.180
(laughs)
<v ->Stalking you.</v>

224
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.760
Joy and happiness are not the appropriate emotion.

225
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.751
They're gonna get you in trouble.

226
00:10:39.751 --> 00:10:42.128
The appropriate emotion is fear and anger

227
00:10:42.128 --> 00:10:45.216
so that you'll either flee, or you'll fight.

228
00:10:45.216 --> 00:10:48.955
And so the issue is really whether

229
00:10:48.955 --> 00:10:51.372
emotions are appropriate to the situation,

230
00:10:51.372 --> 00:10:53.059
or inappropriate to the situation.

231
00:10:53.059 --> 00:10:55.945
And the term that we use to talk about emotions

232
00:10:55.945 --> 00:10:58.483
that are not appropriate to the situation is

233
00:10:58.483 --> 00:11:02.670
pathophysiologically anchored emotional tone.

234
00:11:02.684 --> 00:11:04.005
<v Voiceover>Tell us what that means.</v>

235
00:11:04.005 --> 00:11:07.438
<v ->Well, what that means is that the person, the subject,</v>

236
00:11:07.438 --> 00:11:11.319
is stuck in a particular emotional melue.

237
00:11:11.319 --> 00:11:15.545
So for instance, we see this sometimes in traffic.

238
00:11:15.545 --> 00:11:19.710
Somebody honks and another driver gets upset

239
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:24.710
and flies into a rage, and we see people that

240
00:11:26.659 --> 00:11:29.381
find themselves continuously in a state of fear

241
00:11:29.381 --> 00:11:30.904
or anxiety.

242
00:11:30.904 --> 00:11:34.704
Those are pathophysiologically anchored emotions.

243
00:11:34.704 --> 00:11:39.113
And, if we look at the function of the mind body

244
00:11:39.113 --> 00:11:43.514
is the expression of some informational set,

245
00:11:44.158 --> 00:11:47.185
then we'd have to say that when emotions become

246
00:11:47.185 --> 00:11:49.928
pathophysiologically anchored, that there are

247
00:11:49.928 --> 00:11:54.052
some set of errors within that informational system.

248
00:11:54.052 --> 00:11:58.028
So we apply, again, the NMT clinical pathways

249
00:11:58.028 --> 00:12:01.834
to try to identify what those errors are.

250
00:12:01.834 --> 00:12:05.552
And by making this self-correcting system

251
00:12:05.552 --> 00:12:07.949
of the mind body aware of those errors,

252
00:12:07.949 --> 00:12:10.448
it'll have an opportunity to correct them.

253
00:12:10.448 --> 00:12:12.094
<v Voiceover>So you're saying that the</v>

254
00:12:12.094 --> 00:12:14.593
intrinsic wisdom of the being is always

255
00:12:14.593 --> 00:12:16.848
seeking that homeostasis in self-correction,

256
00:12:16.848 --> 00:12:19.144
given an opportunity?

257
00:12:19.144 --> 00:12:20.322
<v ->That's true.</v>

258
00:12:20.322 --> 00:12:21.074
That's true.

259
00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:25.808
And it responds to an image that is a more correct

260
00:12:25.998 --> 00:12:28.307
physiological state.

261
00:12:28.307 --> 00:12:31.884
Really, what we're doing, as we engage in the NMT

262
00:12:31.884 --> 00:12:36.884
protocol, is identifying and mirroring to the patient,

263
00:12:37.551 --> 00:12:40.599
a picture of the pathophysology of the errors

264
00:12:40.599 --> 00:12:42.163
that it's making.

265
00:12:42.163 --> 00:12:44.357
And building an image of a more correct

266
00:12:44.357 --> 00:12:46.673
and more physiological model

267
00:12:46.673 --> 00:12:49.010
for the body to behave in.

268
00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.712
And when the intelligence of the mind body

269
00:12:51.712 --> 00:12:56.676
recognizes that more correct physiological state,

270
00:12:57.137 --> 00:13:00.246
it mirrors that, it mimics that

271
00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:04.985
and switches into a more physiological process.

272
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.137
And heals itself.

273
00:13:06.137 --> 00:13:07.762
<v Voiceover>Yeah, because even when we're doing</v>

274
00:13:07.762 --> 00:13:09.510
dysfunctional things, I mean some of it's

275
00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:13.106
just sheer habitual, but even in that,

276
00:13:13.106 --> 00:13:15.509
when we initially.

277
00:13:15.605 --> 00:13:17.149
Say we decided to drink a cup of coffee

278
00:13:17.149 --> 00:13:18.145
because we're exhausted,

279
00:13:18.145 --> 00:13:20.278
or drink a glass of wine because we're

280
00:13:20.278 --> 00:13:22.269
feeling a little blue and want to mellow out,

281
00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:23.956
or whatever.

282
00:13:23.956 --> 00:13:27.206
All of those are even so, the body and the brain are

283
00:13:27.206 --> 00:13:30.111
trying and attempting in some way to correct something,

284
00:13:30.111 --> 00:13:31.797
even at that point.

285
00:13:31.797 --> 00:13:34.093
Or we wouldn't initially even reach for that.

286
00:13:34.093 --> 00:13:34.906
<v ->Oh I think that's true.</v>

287
00:13:34.906 --> 00:13:36.186
<v Voiceover>Unless it's just your peer pressure.</v>

288
00:13:36.186 --> 00:13:37.527
<v ->Right. (laughs)
<v Voiceover>Your cigarettes,</v>

289
00:13:37.527 --> 00:13:38.319
say. (laughs)
<v ->Right.</v>

290
00:13:38.319 --> 00:13:40.595
Right.
<v Voiceover>So if</v>

291
00:13:40.595 --> 00:13:43.665
given a chance to do it in a more holistic manner

292
00:13:43.665 --> 00:13:46.568
the body, the being is thrilled to be able

293
00:13:46.568 --> 00:13:49.087
to be guided back to its own balance,

294
00:13:49.087 --> 00:13:51.303
its, then right?

295
00:13:51.303 --> 00:13:52.500
<v ->Well that's right.</v>

296
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.532
And really, within nature

297
00:13:54.532 --> 00:13:56.625
systems are self-organizing.

298
00:13:56.625 --> 00:14:00.201
And even the simplest of molecular systems

299
00:14:00.201 --> 00:14:04.284
organize themselves into certain configurations.

300
00:14:04.284 --> 00:14:06.966
Living things organize themselves

301
00:14:06.966 --> 00:14:09.079
in a very high level.

302
00:14:09.079 --> 00:14:12.208
And that organization is what guides them

303
00:14:12.208 --> 00:14:14.403
in the direction of wellness.

304
00:14:14.403 --> 00:14:16.597
And when confusion occurs within the informational

305
00:14:16.597 --> 00:14:20.686
system, that's what allows illness to ensue.

306
00:14:20.965 --> 00:14:23.260
<v Voiceover>Well this is a very refined level</v>

307
00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.044
of healing you have created.

308
00:14:26.044 --> 00:14:28.421
Of wellness healing.

309
00:14:28.761 --> 00:14:31.326
You started out in chiropractic, as you were saying,

310
00:14:31.326 --> 00:14:32.931
a little bit ago.

311
00:14:32.931 --> 00:14:36.446
That must have led you to a series of other trainings

312
00:14:36.446 --> 00:14:38.193
and discoveries and breakthroughs

313
00:14:38.193 --> 00:14:40.042
until you finally got to this point

314
00:14:40.042 --> 00:14:41.891
of working with pure consciousness

315
00:14:41.891 --> 00:14:43.801
in a very clinical way.

316
00:14:43.801 --> 00:14:45.162
<v ->Well it did.</v>

317
00:14:45.162 --> 00:14:48.596
My training as a chiropractor was primarily

318
00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:51.623
in muscular skeletal problems,

319
00:14:51.623 --> 00:14:54.651
spinal problems, as you might expect.

320
00:14:54.651 --> 00:14:57.088
And that training and the therapies that we use

321
00:14:57.088 --> 00:14:59.506
were primarily physical modalities,

322
00:14:59.506 --> 00:15:03.062
manipulation, stretching, soft tissue work

323
00:15:03.062 --> 00:15:04.910
of various sorts.

324
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.901
Physical therepy methods.

325
00:15:06.901 --> 00:15:08.650
And it was very effective, but it didn't take long

326
00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:12.631
in practice to realize that people had

327
00:15:12.631 --> 00:15:15.645
broader issues that needed to be addressed.

328
00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:20.371
So I began studying with practitioners like

329
00:15:20.371 --> 00:15:24.435
(mumbling), who teaches NEAT.

330
00:15:24.435 --> 00:15:28.051
Victor Frank, who developed TBM.

331
00:15:28.051 --> 00:15:31.723
And those are methods that use

332
00:15:32.562 --> 00:15:36.239
radionic vials, little vials that represent allergens,

333
00:15:36.239 --> 00:15:37.743
or represent some substance,

334
00:15:37.743 --> 00:15:40.424
or some body process or organ.

335
00:15:40.424 --> 00:15:42.558
And there's a protocol that's used then

336
00:15:42.558 --> 00:15:45.037
to try to make corrections in body function.

337
00:15:45.037 --> 00:15:47.637
<v Voiceover>Kind of like a homeopathic imprint.</v>

338
00:15:47.637 --> 00:15:48.368
<v ->Exactly.</v>

339
00:15:48.368 --> 00:15:52.357
A homeopathic imprint on a carrier medium.

340
00:15:52.676 --> 00:15:57.273
And as I use this method I found that it had

341
00:15:57.856 --> 00:16:01.418
some value for some patients, it had limitations.

342
00:16:02.001 --> 00:16:04.927
And I began studying more different types of healing.

343
00:16:04.927 --> 00:16:08.218
And what I recognized is that each of these methods

344
00:16:08.218 --> 00:16:11.408
of healing was really a metaphorical system.

345
00:16:11.408 --> 00:16:12.972
I did some double blind studies

346
00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:15.552
with these radionic vials.

347
00:16:15.552 --> 00:16:19.575
And the thing that I found was that when we would test

348
00:16:19.575 --> 00:16:22.338
with a practitioner using these vials on a subject

349
00:16:22.338 --> 00:16:25.873
and the practitioner was able to take a look at the vial

350
00:16:25.873 --> 00:16:28.982
and identify what it was, knew what it was.

351
00:16:28.982 --> 00:16:33.783
Gave it to the patient to hold, but not to look at,

352
00:16:34.407 --> 00:16:38.592
and muscle tested, that the patient was able to identify,

353
00:16:38.592 --> 00:16:43.454
100% of the time, what those vials contained.

354
00:16:44.748 --> 00:16:46.130
If we blinded those vials

355
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.796
by putting a paper sleeve around them

356
00:16:47.796 --> 00:16:50.152
and put an arbitrary mark,

357
00:16:50.152 --> 00:16:52.956
so that the practitioner, and the patient,

358
00:16:52.956 --> 00:16:56.024
and the subject, didn't know what was in them,

359
00:16:56.024 --> 00:16:58.564
what we found was that the correct identification

360
00:16:58.564 --> 00:17:02.322
was exactly what would be predicted by chance.

361
00:17:02.322 --> 00:17:03.399
So what that told me.

362
00:17:03.399 --> 00:17:04.963
<v Voiceover>Which is what, about 25%, or?</v>

363
00:17:04.963 --> 00:17:06.995
<v ->Well we used four different vials.</v>

364
00:17:06.995 --> 00:17:10.144
So one out of four times, 25%,

365
00:17:10.144 --> 00:17:12.440
would be what chance would predict,

366
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.822
and that's exactly what we found.

367
00:17:13.822 --> 00:17:15.000
<v Voiceover>Quite a drop from 90%</v>

368
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:15.853
(laughs)
<v ->From 100%.</v>

369
00:17:15.853 --> 00:17:17.296
That's right.
<v Voiceover>But then this is</v>

370
00:17:17.296 --> 00:17:19.551
this the key right here, isn't it?

371
00:17:19.551 --> 00:17:20.567
This was the turning point.
<v ->That was the key.</v>

372
00:17:20.567 --> 00:17:21.583
That was the key.
<v Voiceover>The</v>

373
00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:24.529
consciousness of the practitioner was transferred to

374
00:17:24.529 --> 00:17:25.666
the client or patient.

375
00:17:25.666 --> 00:17:26.337
<v ->Exactly.</v>

376
00:17:26.337 --> 00:17:29.791
And you might ask, how does that happen?

377
00:17:29.791 --> 00:17:31.904
There's an interesting experiment that was

378
00:17:31.904 --> 00:17:35.154
conducted by Dean Radin, he's a physicist

379
00:17:35.154 --> 00:17:38.493
with The Institute of Noetic Sciences.

380
00:17:38.507 --> 00:17:41.270
The experiment that he did tells us a lot about

381
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:45.050
the mechanism by which NMT works.

382
00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.853
And by which information is exchanged

383
00:17:47.853 --> 00:17:50.555
between the practitioner and the patient.

384
00:17:50.555 --> 00:17:53.927
So in this study they brought together subjects,

385
00:17:53.927 --> 00:17:55.085
two subjects.

386
00:17:55.085 --> 00:17:58.925
And those subjects would be hooked up with an EEG machine,

387
00:17:58.925 --> 00:18:01.384
an electroencephalograph.

388
00:18:01.384 --> 00:18:03.761
They'd have the subjects meditate together,

389
00:18:03.761 --> 00:18:07.418
and what they found is that the tracings of the EEG

390
00:18:07.418 --> 00:18:11.528
would entrain, they would mirror one another.

391
00:18:11.664 --> 00:18:13.635
<v Voiceover>Their brains would fall into synchronization.</v>

392
00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:15.098
<v ->They'd fall into synchronization.</v>

393
00:18:15.098 --> 00:18:18.857
So what they did at that point after the synchronization

394
00:18:18.857 --> 00:18:21.782
was noted, is separate the subjects and put them

395
00:18:21.782 --> 00:18:25.784
into a faraday caged rooms, that were light proof

396
00:18:25.784 --> 00:18:26.780
and sound proof.

397
00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.405
And what a faraday cage does,

398
00:18:28.405 --> 00:18:32.692
is it insulates the room for many electro magnetic

399
00:18:32.692 --> 00:18:34.825
communication that would happen.

400
00:18:34.825 --> 00:18:39.335
So that there's no way, at least in classical physics

401
00:18:39.335 --> 00:18:42.405
to explain what happens next.

402
00:18:42.405 --> 00:18:45.026
And that is, that when one of the subjects

403
00:18:45.026 --> 00:18:49.664
was exposed to flashing strobe lights to their eyes,

404
00:18:50.389 --> 00:18:55.068
that the very same lighting up of the

405
00:18:55.225 --> 00:18:59.451
lobes of their brain that have correlated

406
00:18:59.451 --> 00:19:01.463
to that strobe light happen not only

407
00:19:01.463 --> 00:19:02.924
in the person that was exposed to the light,

408
00:19:02.924 --> 00:19:06.907
but in the other person locked away in this insulated

409
00:19:06.907 --> 00:19:08.897
and faraday caged room.

410
00:19:08.897 --> 00:19:12.311
So what it tells us is that there is an entanglement,

411
00:19:12.311 --> 00:19:15.297
or a communication that happens,

412
00:19:15.297 --> 00:19:17.349
even when we're not aware of it,

413
00:19:17.349 --> 00:19:19.279
on a mind to mind level.

414
00:19:19.279 --> 00:19:23.261
And this really is a mechanism that plays out when we

415
00:19:24.391 --> 00:19:27.920
produce the NMT effect with our patients.

416
00:19:29.885 --> 00:19:31.693
<v Voiceover>Another scientist I know of</v>

417
00:19:31.693 --> 00:19:35.390
did a similar study, and this was one just for fun

418
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:36.793
because he could.

419
00:19:36.793 --> 00:19:39.494
And they did this having the hearts

420
00:19:40.144 --> 00:19:42.746
hooked up between his wife,

421
00:19:42.746 --> 00:19:44.534
who was with friends in another part of the house,

422
00:19:44.534 --> 00:19:46.280
and himself.

423
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.845
She was busy doing what she was doing,

424
00:19:47.845 --> 00:19:49.715
not knowing what was going to be going on.

425
00:19:49.715 --> 00:19:52.619
He was simply sending feelings of appreciation,

426
00:19:52.619 --> 00:19:54.185
gratitude, and love to her.

427
00:19:54.185 --> 00:19:56.623
And the same thing, at the same time their hearts

428
00:19:56.623 --> 00:19:59.019
began entraining and falling into the same rhythm

429
00:19:59.019 --> 00:20:00.746
even though she was unaware,

430
00:20:00.746 --> 00:20:03.145
and actually just socializing.

431
00:20:03.145 --> 00:20:06.070
We've seen the same thing in experiments with plants.

432
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:07.797
Where a part of a plant is removed,

433
00:20:07.797 --> 00:20:10.254
and one part is impacted, and one other part

434
00:20:10.254 --> 00:20:12.003
in another city responds.

435
00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:12.692
And dogs.

436
00:20:12.692 --> 00:20:15.557
And so now we're into quantum healing,

437
00:20:15.557 --> 00:20:17.223
we're into quantum consciousness.

438
00:20:17.223 --> 00:20:21.104
And you took this and you have created something

439
00:20:21.104 --> 00:20:25.981
that appears to me, to be extremely efficient and elegant.

440
00:20:25.981 --> 00:20:27.097
How did you get to that part

441
00:20:27.097 --> 00:20:31.574
after going through the resonance studies and such?

442
00:20:33.051 --> 00:20:36.809
<v ->It was a recognition that if these props</v>

443
00:20:36.809 --> 00:20:38.637
that we were using for different methods

444
00:20:38.637 --> 00:20:41.644
of energetic medicine were just that.

445
00:20:41.644 --> 00:20:44.306
If they were props, representations

446
00:20:44.306 --> 00:20:45.871
of meaning and significance,

447
00:20:45.871 --> 00:20:48.878
then those were really limiting factors.

448
00:20:48.878 --> 00:20:51.275
They might be helpful up to a certain point

449
00:20:51.275 --> 00:20:54.485
but there was a point at which they limited us.

450
00:20:54.485 --> 00:20:57.960
That is, any particular radionic vial that we would use

451
00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.250
would have a particular meaning.

452
00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:04.928
Any particular gesture that was used

453
00:21:04.928 --> 00:21:07.367
in some energetic medicine protocol

454
00:21:07.367 --> 00:21:10.236
would have a particular meaning.

455
00:21:10.718 --> 00:21:12.831
Any particular point on the body

456
00:21:12.831 --> 00:21:15.553
that was used as a representation

457
00:21:15.553 --> 00:21:19.515
in the course of fiscal medicine modality

458
00:21:19.515 --> 00:21:21.731
would have some particular meaning.

459
00:21:21.731 --> 00:21:25.712
So it occurred to me that if we used language structure,

460
00:21:25.712 --> 00:21:28.576
semantic structure, to convey meaning,

461
00:21:28.576 --> 00:21:31.747
and to query, to question the mind body

462
00:21:31.747 --> 00:21:34.753
for to identify the nature of the problems

463
00:21:34.753 --> 00:21:36.967
that were causing illness,

464
00:21:36.967 --> 00:21:38.898
that it gave us much more latitude

465
00:21:38.898 --> 00:21:41.762
and much more flexibility, much more power,

466
00:21:41.762 --> 00:21:44.756
because language is the strongest,

467
00:21:44.932 --> 00:21:46.902
and most powerful metaphorical system

468
00:21:46.902 --> 00:21:49.550
that humans have ever built.

469
00:21:49.767 --> 00:21:53.343
So it gives us much more ability to

470
00:21:53.343 --> 00:21:55.639
identify what's going on in the body.

471
00:21:55.639 --> 00:21:57.244
<v Voiceover>You're not talking into the</v>

472
00:21:57.244 --> 00:21:58.808
busy conscious mind either.

473
00:21:58.808 --> 00:22:01.654
I've seen NMT in action.
<v ->Yes.</v>

474
00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:03.055
<v Voiceover>And there's often, it almost seems</v>

475
00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:05.208
like the practitioner is almost speaking under their breath

476
00:22:05.208 --> 00:22:07.016
to the body directly.
<v ->Exactly.</v>

477
00:22:07.016 --> 00:22:09.068
<v Voiceover>So the person can zone out</v>

478
00:22:09.068 --> 00:22:11.548
and you don't have to be aware of what's going on at all.

479
00:22:11.548 --> 00:22:15.651
So we're talking about the real mind body connection,

480
00:22:15.651 --> 00:22:18.293
not the conscious chattering mind body connection.

481
00:22:18.293 --> 00:22:21.604
<v ->That's exactly right, because the conscious mind</v>

482
00:22:21.604 --> 00:22:23.473
doesn't control the body.

483
00:22:23.473 --> 00:22:25.831
As we're having this conversation

484
00:22:25.831 --> 00:22:27.252
your liver is doing different things,

485
00:22:27.252 --> 00:22:28.735
your heart is doing different things,

486
00:22:28.735 --> 00:22:30.807
your digestive system are doing different things,

487
00:22:30.807 --> 00:22:33.103
but you're not thinking of that at all

488
00:22:33.103 --> 00:22:34.445
with your conscious mind.

489
00:22:34.445 --> 00:22:37.471
And yet, those are all functions that have to be

490
00:22:37.471 --> 00:22:39.909
regulated moment by moment by moment

491
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:41.961
in a very accurate way.

492
00:22:41.961 --> 00:22:45.457
So again, going back to the iceberg metaphor,

493
00:22:45.457 --> 00:22:49.297
the 10% is that 10% that you and I are using

494
00:22:49.297 --> 00:22:50.618
to have this conversation.

495
00:22:50.618 --> 00:22:55.005
But the 90% is the much larger portion of our nervous

496
00:22:55.005 --> 00:22:57.993
system that is regulating the body.

497
00:22:57.993 --> 00:23:01.751
So as we perform NMT,

498
00:23:01.751 --> 00:23:05.245
what you would see is that the practitioner

499
00:23:05.245 --> 00:23:09.566
would select a particular

500
00:23:09.566 --> 00:23:12.076
clinical pathway

501
00:23:12.076 --> 00:23:14.178
appropriate to whatever the problems were

502
00:23:14.178 --> 00:23:16.704
that the patient was having.

503
00:23:17.632 --> 00:23:20.803
And the practitioner would typically

504
00:23:20.803 --> 00:23:23.260
verbally deliver the query statements

505
00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.861
and the corrective statements.

506
00:23:25.861 --> 00:23:28.096
The reason that that's done,

507
00:23:28.096 --> 00:23:29.416
there are a couple of reasons really.

508
00:23:29.416 --> 00:23:31.712
One is that I think it's a good thing for the patient

509
00:23:31.712 --> 00:23:34.009
to recognize on a conscious mind

510
00:23:34.009 --> 00:23:36.466
what the nature of the interaction is

511
00:23:36.466 --> 00:23:38.234
that we're having with the subject matter is,

512
00:23:38.234 --> 00:23:40.651
and what we're trying to accomplish.

513
00:23:40.651 --> 00:23:43.882
But, the correction that we're trying to make

514
00:23:43.882 --> 00:23:46.402
doesn't happen at a conscious level.

515
00:23:46.402 --> 00:23:50.973
And the proof of that is that this process

516
00:23:50.973 --> 00:23:54.651
can all be done silently, that is, instead of verbalizing,

517
00:23:54.651 --> 00:23:57.597
the practitioner can just bring to mind

518
00:23:57.597 --> 00:24:01.047
these query statements, and command statements.

519
00:24:01.047 --> 00:24:03.973
And muscle tests, we use muscle testing

520
00:24:03.973 --> 00:24:06.858
as a way of getting a response from this

521
00:24:06.858 --> 00:24:09.561
other than conscious portion of the nervous system.

522
00:24:09.561 --> 00:24:11.856
And can go through the whole protocol in a silent way

523
00:24:11.856 --> 00:24:14.504
and get the same response.

524
00:24:14.579 --> 00:24:17.545
We can also use this protocol with animals

525
00:24:17.545 --> 00:24:21.405
who obviously don't understand on a conscious level

526
00:24:21.405 --> 00:24:23.423
much at all.

527
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:28.455
We can use it with infants who haven't yet learned language.

528
00:24:28.455 --> 00:24:31.705
And we can also use it with subjects that speak

529
00:24:31.705 --> 00:24:35.444
a language other than the language of the practitioner.

530
00:24:35.444 --> 00:24:37.069
<v Voiceover>And you have an interesting little device,</v>

531
00:24:37.069 --> 00:24:38.695
I don't know if you created the device,

532
00:24:38.695 --> 00:24:42.798
but certainly utilize the little disc device,

533
00:24:42.798 --> 00:24:45.922
that helps almost through a kineseological

534
00:24:45.922 --> 00:24:48.909
type of response, friction, to be able to relay

535
00:24:48.909 --> 00:24:51.123
that information quickly and accurately

536
00:24:51.123 --> 00:24:55.451
from the bio resonance field back to the practitioner

537
00:24:55.451 --> 00:24:57.259
so they'll know exactly where to go

538
00:24:57.259 --> 00:24:59.088
next in their line of inquiry.

539
00:24:59.088 --> 00:24:59.921
<v ->Right.
<v Voiceover>It's very</v>

540
00:24:59.921 --> 00:25:02.135
interesting.
<v ->It is very interesting.</v>

541
00:25:02.135 --> 00:25:05.995
And you're talking about a resonance membrane

542
00:25:05.995 --> 00:25:10.370
that's used by some of our practitioners, not all.

543
00:25:10.567 --> 00:25:12.802
And it's a substitute for muscle testing.

544
00:25:12.802 --> 00:25:13.655
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

545
00:25:13.655 --> 00:25:15.321
I was going to get to applied kineseology and all this,

546
00:25:15.321 --> 00:25:18.349
maybe you can just launch into how this fits into it.

547
00:25:18.349 --> 00:25:19.059
<v ->Sure.</v>

548
00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:20.346
Sure.

549
00:25:20.361 --> 00:25:23.116
The idea of this is that our conscious mind

550
00:25:23.116 --> 00:25:25.269
is the only portion of the nervous system

551
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:27.525
that controls speech.

552
00:25:27.525 --> 00:25:29.658
And it may be a lucky thing.

553
00:25:29.658 --> 00:25:32.198
But, the other thing conscious mind controls

554
00:25:32.198 --> 00:25:35.104
all kinds of parameters of body function.

555
00:25:35.104 --> 00:25:38.475
And among those things that it controls

556
00:25:38.475 --> 00:25:42.132
is the ability to transmit motor signals to muscles.

557
00:25:42.132 --> 00:25:45.871
So as we do muscle testing with a patient

558
00:25:45.871 --> 00:25:49.223
we'll ask them to perhaps hold an arm out,

559
00:25:49.223 --> 00:25:51.499
maybe we'll use a shoulder muscle,

560
00:25:51.499 --> 00:25:54.343
and ask them to resist with a certain amount of effort.

561
00:25:54.343 --> 00:25:55.968
Maybe the amount of effort that it would take

562
00:25:55.968 --> 00:25:58.366
to hold up three or four pounds.

563
00:25:58.366 --> 00:26:00.560
And to always be consistent with that level of effort

564
00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.466
so that as we muscle test when we notice some difference

565
00:26:03.466 --> 00:26:05.153
in their strength.

566
00:26:05.153 --> 00:26:06.635
<v Voiceover>If their neck is straining</v>

567
00:26:06.635 --> 00:26:07.996
then you know their trying too hard.

568
00:26:07.996 --> 00:26:09.296
<v ->We know they're trying too hard.</v>

569
00:26:09.296 --> 00:26:10.210
(laughs)
That's right.

570
00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:12.546
So if there's a change then,

571
00:26:12.546 --> 00:26:13.460
all things being equal,

572
00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:14.842
they're using the same level of effort,

573
00:26:14.842 --> 00:26:17.037
if there's a change in the resistance that we feel

574
00:26:17.037 --> 00:26:20.612
in the muscle we can use that as a response

575
00:26:20.612 --> 00:26:22.054
to our query.

576
00:26:22.054 --> 00:26:24.392
In other words, if it's our intention

577
00:26:24.392 --> 00:26:28.474
as we interact on this kineseological level,

578
00:26:28.474 --> 00:26:32.189
muscle testing level, that a strong test is an

579
00:26:32.189 --> 00:26:34.585
affirmative response and agreement,

580
00:26:34.585 --> 00:26:37.532
and a weak test is a negative response,

581
00:26:37.532 --> 00:26:40.782
or a disagreement with our statement, or our query,

582
00:26:40.782 --> 00:26:43.973
then we can have a conversation that will proceed

583
00:26:43.973 --> 00:26:47.080
based on strong and weak responses from the

584
00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.194
particular test muscle that we use.

585
00:26:49.194 --> 00:26:53.216
Now similarly, we can use galvanic skin response

586
00:26:53.216 --> 00:26:55.489
because the other than conscious portion

587
00:26:55.489 --> 00:26:58.029
of the nervous system controls the sweating response

588
00:26:58.029 --> 00:26:59.471
to the skin.

589
00:26:59.471 --> 00:27:01.908
So we can use devices that measure the

590
00:27:01.908 --> 00:27:06.723
conductivity of the skin, which fluctuates instantaneously

591
00:27:06.723 --> 00:27:10.239
then as we ask these questions.

592
00:27:10.239 --> 00:27:13.802
And as the other than conscious nervous system

593
00:27:13.802 --> 00:27:17.471
gives us an affirmative, or a negative response.

594
00:27:17.471 --> 00:27:20.072
<v Voiceover>And that's also the basis of</v>

595
00:27:20.072 --> 00:27:22.383
it now going into bio feedback, as well.

596
00:27:22.383 --> 00:27:26.818
So how, so now let's talk about what a dialogue is like

597
00:27:26.818 --> 00:27:30.074
between you and a body.

598
00:27:30.454 --> 00:27:33.887
If you can do that in a really simplistic manner,

599
00:27:33.887 --> 00:27:35.553
how you might begin a line of inquiry,

600
00:27:35.553 --> 00:27:37.849
say someone says, "Oh, my back's really hurting.

601
00:27:37.849 --> 00:27:40.003
"I think my kidneys are off.", and blah blah blah.

602
00:27:40.003 --> 00:27:40.938
Okay?

603
00:27:40.938 --> 00:27:42.380
Let's start from something like that.

604
00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:43.335
<v ->Sure.</v>

605
00:27:43.335 --> 00:27:46.099
So if I had a subject in front of me

606
00:27:46.099 --> 00:27:48.435
with a back problem,

607
00:27:48.435 --> 00:27:52.132
I would select a particular pathway.

608
00:27:52.552 --> 00:27:54.387
Typically it would be what we call

609
00:27:54.387 --> 00:27:57.009
the sensory motor pathway.

610
00:27:57.009 --> 00:28:00.360
And in working with that patient

611
00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.221
I would first look at what we call the tagging

612
00:28:04.221 --> 00:28:06.029
of affluent stimuli.

613
00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:10.215
That is, how is, how are the signals that come from

614
00:28:10.215 --> 00:28:12.772
the muscles, and the joints, and the connective tissues

615
00:28:12.772 --> 00:28:14.356
being interpreted?

616
00:28:14.356 --> 00:28:16.978
Is the stretch signal being misinterpreted

617
00:28:16.978 --> 00:28:19.482
as a pain signal?

618
00:28:20.227 --> 00:28:21.934
We would identify those errors

619
00:28:21.934 --> 00:28:25.408
that happen in the attachment of meaning

620
00:28:25.408 --> 00:28:28.700
to the sensory signals that come to the brain.

621
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:29.554
The next step.
<v Voiceover>That's</v>

622
00:28:29.554 --> 00:28:31.708
important because sometimes a person thinks it's pain

623
00:28:31.708 --> 00:28:32.948
when it's just different.

624
00:28:32.948 --> 00:28:34.145
<v ->That's right, that's right.</v>

625
00:28:34.145 --> 00:28:35.933
Pain is an interpretation.

626
00:28:35.933 --> 00:28:38.391
You know, we might think, well, I have pain my back,

627
00:28:38.391 --> 00:28:41.987
but the fact is you only have pain in the brain.

628
00:28:41.987 --> 00:28:45.869
It's the only place that pain is acknowledged

629
00:28:45.869 --> 00:28:47.391
or recognized.

630
00:28:47.391 --> 00:28:51.970
So it is a process of cognition and recognition.

631
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:54.563
The next step that we look at is

632
00:28:54.563 --> 00:28:56.901
the status of sensory end organs.

633
00:28:56.901 --> 00:28:59.034
So kind of like a thermostat in a house,

634
00:28:59.034 --> 00:29:01.962
it can be set at a low level or a high level.

635
00:29:01.962 --> 00:29:04.806
And similarly, sensory end organ

636
00:29:04.806 --> 00:29:07.000
can be set at a low or a high level.

637
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.659
So for instance, the pressure sensors in the eye

638
00:29:10.659 --> 00:29:12.467
are set at a fairly low level.

639
00:29:12.467 --> 00:29:14.133
It doesn't take much pressure on the eye

640
00:29:14.133 --> 00:29:15.982
before we withdraw from that pressure

641
00:29:15.982 --> 00:29:18.319
because it's a sensitive area.

642
00:29:18.319 --> 00:29:21.286
On the other hand, the sensors on the

643
00:29:21.286 --> 00:29:23.723
bottom of the feet are able to

644
00:29:23.723 --> 00:29:25.369
take quite a bit of pressure.

645
00:29:25.369 --> 00:29:27.441
And you can imagine what kind of a problem you'd have

646
00:29:27.441 --> 00:29:30.791
if those sensitivities were switched.

647
00:29:30.791 --> 00:29:32.459
<v Voiceover>You can't walk.</v>

648
00:29:32.459 --> 00:29:34.064
<v ->You couldn't walk.
(laughs)

649
00:29:34.064 --> 00:29:36.665
And your eye would be vulnerable to all kinds of problems.

650
00:29:36.665 --> 00:29:37.965
<v Voiceover>Oh gosh, yes.</v>
<v ->Wouldn't it?</v>

651
00:29:37.965 --> 00:29:40.180
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->So we look at these.</v>

652
00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:41.642
<v Voiceover>You could take a poke in the eye</v>

653
00:29:41.642 --> 00:29:43.898
with a sharp stick and get through it okay.

654
00:29:43.898 --> 00:29:45.951
(laughing)

655
00:29:45.951 --> 00:29:47.900
<v ->I guess so, in the short term.</v>

656
00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:51.679
So we then go through the rest of the sensory motor path.

657
00:29:51.679 --> 00:29:53.223
We're looking at things like,

658
00:29:53.223 --> 00:29:56.169
the way that the central nervous system processes

659
00:29:56.169 --> 00:29:57.577
signaling.

660
00:29:58.391 --> 00:30:02.224
We look at issues of autonomic influence.

661
00:30:02.224 --> 00:30:05.474
And the result of going through eight or nine

662
00:30:05.474 --> 00:30:07.465
steps of this sensory motor pathway

663
00:30:07.465 --> 00:30:09.620
is to identify all those errors

664
00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:13.074
that are causing inappropriate perception of pain,

665
00:30:13.074 --> 00:30:15.593
or inappropriate spasticity.

666
00:30:15.593 --> 00:30:19.671
And by doing that, to resolve the pain,

667
00:30:19.671 --> 00:30:22.976
it's not analogous to using an anesthetic.

668
00:30:22.976 --> 00:30:24.806
Because if we use an anesthetic,

669
00:30:24.806 --> 00:30:27.378
pain that shouldn't be there that is appropriate

670
00:30:27.378 --> 00:30:30.202
to protect us, would be covered up.

671
00:30:30.202 --> 00:30:32.883
And there's nothing in the neuro modulation system

672
00:30:32.883 --> 00:30:34.896
that does that.

673
00:30:34.896 --> 00:30:39.246
Our goal is simply to identify and correct

674
00:30:39.906 --> 00:30:42.332
body function that shouldn't be there.

675
00:30:42.332 --> 00:30:44.870
So pain that's inappropriate to the circumstances,

676
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:48.304
chronic pain, in particular, is something that persists

677
00:30:48.304 --> 00:30:52.530
long after the healing process has been completed.

678
00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:55.456
Chronic pain is something that responds very quickly

679
00:30:55.456 --> 00:30:56.959
to NMT.

680
00:30:56.959 --> 00:30:58.544
Because it's an error,

681
00:30:58.544 --> 00:31:00.678
it's the body locked into a physiology

682
00:31:00.678 --> 00:31:02.608
that might have been appropriate one time,

683
00:31:02.608 --> 00:31:06.651
shortly after an injury, but no longer is appropriate.

684
00:31:06.651 --> 00:31:09.027
<v Voiceover>So once you're able to create the dialogue</v>

685
00:31:09.027 --> 00:31:11.974
you're able to pinpoint where the misinformation

686
00:31:11.974 --> 00:31:15.590
has occurred, how do you then, begin creating the dialogue

687
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:18.516
again to get the agreement for the pattern

688
00:31:18.516 --> 00:31:20.263
that's been holding to release itself

689
00:31:20.263 --> 00:31:22.763
and go back into a healing pattern?

690
00:31:22.763 --> 00:31:25.165
Or a healing status.

691
00:31:25.728 --> 00:31:29.832
<v ->The agreement is signaled by the muscle test,</v>

692
00:31:29.832 --> 00:31:31.357
by the galvanic skin response,

693
00:31:31.357 --> 00:31:35.650
by the use of the friction device that you mentioned.

694
00:31:36.253 --> 00:31:40.600
And the agreement takes a step

695
00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.994
by step by step through a multi-step process

696
00:31:43.994 --> 00:31:48.830
that constitutes the NMT clinical pathway that's being used.

697
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:50.210
<v Voiceover>So that's where the protocols,</v>

698
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:53.056
this is where it becomes really refined.

699
00:31:53.056 --> 00:31:54.050
<v ->Exactly.
<v Voiceover>In terms in</v>

700
00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:55.899
exact the procedure.

701
00:31:55.899 --> 00:31:57.199
The protocol from that point forward

702
00:31:57.199 --> 00:31:59.008
to go through layer after layer

703
00:31:59.008 --> 00:32:00.918
until you find an a-ha, there it is, there's the seed.

704
00:32:00.918 --> 00:32:04.297
<v ->That's right.
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

705
00:32:04.838 --> 00:32:07.947
<v ->So as we apply these pathways</v>

706
00:32:07.947 --> 00:32:10.344
we identify what number of pathways

707
00:32:10.344 --> 00:32:13.289
might be required in order to

708
00:32:13.289 --> 00:32:16.297
resolve the problem that the patient presents with.

709
00:32:16.297 --> 00:32:18.106
<v Voiceover>So how quickly can NMT</v>

710
00:32:18.106 --> 00:32:19.650
begin working on a person?

711
00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:21.885
And can you give us a few of your,

712
00:32:21.885 --> 00:32:24.301
some examples that are near and dear to your heart

713
00:32:24.301 --> 00:32:26.435
of some dramatic responses.

714
00:32:26.435 --> 00:32:28.771
And then maybe an example of something very typical

715
00:32:28.771 --> 00:32:30.213
that say, has been chronic.

716
00:32:30.213 --> 00:32:31.046
<v ->Sure.</v>

717
00:32:31.046 --> 00:32:31.636
Sure.

718
00:32:31.636 --> 00:32:33.688
I'll just give you some examples from this week

719
00:32:33.688 --> 00:32:37.366
because there really miraculous things that happen

720
00:32:37.366 --> 00:32:40.170
with NMT, but they're not the rare things

721
00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:42.444
where we reach back to a particular case and go,

722
00:32:42.444 --> 00:32:45.715
"Wow, this was so fantastic, I have to tell you about it."

723
00:32:45.715 --> 00:32:46.630
<v Voiceover>Every day miracles.</v>

724
00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:49.271
<v ->It's every day miracles, which is really amazing.</v>

725
00:32:49.271 --> 00:32:53.050
So this week I treated a patient

726
00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:56.341
who was a woman in her mid 20s

727
00:32:56.341 --> 00:32:59.369
in the second month of her second pregnancy.

728
00:32:59.369 --> 00:33:02.706
With a condition called hyperemesis gravidarum,

729
00:33:02.706 --> 00:33:06.278
which is also term nausea of pregnancy.

730
00:33:06.352 --> 00:33:08.675
And this was really severe.

731
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:13.429
She was retching hourly, severe nausea, all day long.

732
00:33:13.606 --> 00:33:15.393
Couldn't keep anything down, even water,

733
00:33:15.393 --> 00:33:17.547
and she was really miserable.

734
00:33:17.547 --> 00:33:22.138
So this is a situation that happens not infrequently.

735
00:33:23.408 --> 00:33:27.583
It seems to involve some kind of an allergy response

736
00:33:27.583 --> 00:33:31.255
between the mother and the fetus.

737
00:33:31.255 --> 00:33:32.921
Because you have to realize that of course

738
00:33:32.921 --> 00:33:37.580
the fetus is only 50% the DNA of the mother.

739
00:33:38.001 --> 00:33:40.032
So you can imagine what would happen

740
00:33:40.032 --> 00:33:42.389
if you had a kidney transplant from somebody

741
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:44.888
that was only 50% compatible with you

742
00:33:44.888 --> 00:33:47.021
will similarly there are a lot of changes

743
00:33:47.021 --> 00:33:48.647
that would have to happen to a woman

744
00:33:48.647 --> 00:33:50.292
during the process or pregnancy

745
00:33:50.292 --> 00:33:52.995
to allow them to carry the baby.

746
00:33:52.995 --> 00:33:54.701
And sometimes errors occur

747
00:33:54.701 --> 00:33:58.907
and that results in this nausea of pregnancy.

748
00:33:58.907 --> 00:34:01.832
We treated her once.

749
00:34:01.832 --> 00:34:05.835
She immediately had a 40, 50% resolution of the nausea.

750
00:34:05.835 --> 00:34:09.187
We treated a second time, a week later,

751
00:34:09.187 --> 00:34:12.031
and by the time that the treatment was finished

752
00:34:12.031 --> 00:34:13.841
all of the nausea was gone.

753
00:34:13.841 --> 00:34:17.355
And I spoke with her this week

754
00:34:17.355 --> 00:34:21.154
and she'd told me she'd had no return of nausea.

755
00:34:21.154 --> 00:34:22.759
So it's really quite amazing.

756
00:34:22.759 --> 00:34:23.877
<v Voiceover>That is amazing.</v>

757
00:34:23.877 --> 00:34:25.847
Let's look at something that a person's carried

758
00:34:25.847 --> 00:34:27.371
with them for quite a long time.

759
00:34:27.371 --> 00:34:28.611
Now you can get a sip of water

760
00:34:28.611 --> 00:34:29.870
while I'm asking this question.

761
00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:30.643
<v ->Thank you.
<v Voiceover>If you'd like.</v>

762
00:34:30.643 --> 00:34:34.590
How about something that is chronic,

763
00:34:34.888 --> 00:34:37.346
that has maybe dogged someone for

764
00:34:37.346 --> 00:34:39.419
the better part of their lives?

765
00:34:39.419 --> 00:34:41.776
So you're talking about really having to

766
00:34:41.776 --> 00:34:44.667
talk to this body. (laughs)

767
00:34:44.823 --> 00:34:46.592
What is, can you give us an example of some of those,

768
00:34:46.592 --> 00:34:48.419
because I think a lot of people watching right now

769
00:34:48.419 --> 00:34:49.902
probably have had something like this.

770
00:34:49.902 --> 00:34:51.331
<v ->Sure.</v>

771
00:34:51.995 --> 00:34:55.694
I had a patient who came in to my office

772
00:34:55.694 --> 00:34:58.152
about three years ago with severe low back pain.

773
00:34:58.152 --> 00:35:00.535
She was a woman of 62.

774
00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:03.291
As I examined her, we often go through

775
00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:06.909
a physical examination, as well as our NMT evaluation.

776
00:35:06.909 --> 00:35:08.777
What we found was that her range of motion was

777
00:35:08.777 --> 00:35:10.708
severely limited.

778
00:35:10.708 --> 00:35:14.182
If she tried to extend to arch her back

779
00:35:14.182 --> 00:35:15.604
in a standing position,

780
00:35:15.604 --> 00:35:17.514
she'd immediately have severe pain in the back,

781
00:35:17.514 --> 00:35:20.663
but she'd also have radiating electrical pains

782
00:35:20.663 --> 00:35:22.877
that would go down her legs.

783
00:35:22.877 --> 00:35:26.371
She could bend to within about 12, 16 inches

784
00:35:26.371 --> 00:35:27.571
to the floor.

785
00:35:27.571 --> 00:35:29.359
And she said, you know, it had been this way

786
00:35:29.359 --> 00:35:31.539
for about 15 years.

787
00:35:31.919 --> 00:35:35.048
She wasn't even able to play with her grandchildren.

788
00:35:35.048 --> 00:35:37.302
And it was quite a limiting situation.

789
00:35:37.302 --> 00:35:39.457
She'd been to a lot of medical doctors

790
00:35:39.457 --> 00:35:41.589
and she'd been evaluated pretty thoroughly.

791
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:43.153
There was no surgical situation,

792
00:35:43.153 --> 00:35:45.266
there was no clear pathology,

793
00:35:45.266 --> 00:35:47.609
no herniated disc.

794
00:35:48.132 --> 00:35:50.387
So we applied the Neuro Modulation Technique,

795
00:35:50.387 --> 00:35:52.296
the sensory motor pathway, and by the time we

796
00:35:52.296 --> 00:35:54.674
finished about a 20 minute session

797
00:35:54.674 --> 00:35:57.437
literally all of her pain was gone.

798
00:35:57.437 --> 00:35:58.838
<v Voiceover>Amazing.</v>

799
00:35:58.838 --> 00:36:02.840
<v ->We explained to her that the changes that happened</v>

800
00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.969
with her weren't physical changes.

801
00:36:05.969 --> 00:36:08.388
These were changes that happened at an informational

802
00:36:08.388 --> 00:36:10.378
level in her nervous system.

803
00:36:10.378 --> 00:36:14.299
We also explained that because she had a 15 year history

804
00:36:14.299 --> 00:36:18.181
of severe low back pain that it was likely that she would

805
00:36:18.181 --> 00:36:21.085
see some of the, there would be a tendency

806
00:36:21.085 --> 00:36:24.213
to revert to this familiar pattern of pain.

807
00:36:24.213 --> 00:36:27.139
So it was interesting, her next appointment was

808
00:36:27.139 --> 00:36:30.247
to be a week later, and she had called and canceled.

809
00:36:30.247 --> 00:36:33.884
So I thought, you know, she had been hurting for 15 years,

810
00:36:33.884 --> 00:36:37.317
I should give her a call and make sure she understands

811
00:36:37.317 --> 00:36:38.211
what's going on.

812
00:36:38.211 --> 00:36:40.507
So we had a conversation and she decided to come back.

813
00:36:40.507 --> 00:36:44.266
So we did two more sessions, and from that point on

814
00:36:44.266 --> 00:36:46.034
she was completely pain free.

815
00:36:46.034 --> 00:36:47.943
I think it was about a year and a half later

816
00:36:47.943 --> 00:36:52.434
she came in again, had some small incident occur

817
00:36:52.434 --> 00:36:54.322
and a little bit of pain and we treated her once

818
00:36:54.322 --> 00:36:55.217
and released her.

819
00:36:55.217 --> 00:36:57.350
So it was really quite a wonderful--

820
00:36:57.350 --> 00:36:58.373
<v Voiceover>Wow.</v>
<v ->response</v>

821
00:36:58.373 --> 00:37:01.126
and I understand she's playing very actively

822
00:37:01.126 --> 00:37:02.222
(laughing)
with her grandkids.

823
00:37:02.222 --> 00:37:03.990
<v Voiceover>Very happily with her grandkids.</v>

824
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:05.473
That's impressive.

825
00:37:05.473 --> 00:37:08.542
How do you do with garden variety sporting injuries?

826
00:37:08.542 --> 00:37:10.999
Frozen shoulders, things like that.

827
00:37:10.999 --> 00:37:14.479
<v ->Shoulder injuries respond very well.</v>

828
00:37:14.514 --> 00:37:19.045
The shoulder is a joint that requires a precise

829
00:37:22.185 --> 00:37:25.852
integration of all this array of muscles that attach

830
00:37:25.852 --> 00:37:29.224
all around the shoulder in order to work properly.

831
00:37:29.224 --> 00:37:33.246
And when there's patterning within the neuro muscular

832
00:37:33.246 --> 00:37:36.720
system that upsets that, the range of motion is off,

833
00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.483
it's limited, there's pain, stiffness,

834
00:37:39.483 --> 00:37:42.500
and we usually see those things resolve very quickly.

835
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:43.618
<v Voiceover>Oh that's great.</v>

836
00:37:43.618 --> 00:37:44.756
Now let's get to another one.

837
00:37:44.756 --> 00:37:46.768
The buzz word, everywhere I go I've been meeting

838
00:37:46.768 --> 00:37:49.469
so many people, both in this line of work, and outside.

839
00:37:49.469 --> 00:37:52.822
You know, among friends, and people at large.

840
00:37:52.822 --> 00:37:54.001
Cavitations.

841
00:37:54.001 --> 00:37:58.497
The subject of cavitation is our buzz word this month.

842
00:37:58.937 --> 00:38:00.848
Can you talk about what cavitations are,

843
00:38:00.848 --> 00:38:01.964
why they're a problem.

844
00:38:01.964 --> 00:38:03.975
And then I want to take a look at some of you what

845
00:38:03.975 --> 00:38:07.632
you've done with cavitations, which is truly remarkable.

846
00:38:07.632 --> 00:38:12.569
<v ->Cavitations are a situation in which the bone</v>

847
00:38:12.569 --> 00:38:15.273
in the alveolar arches.

848
00:38:15.273 --> 00:38:16.696
<v Voiceover>Can you say that in English?</v>

849
00:38:16.696 --> 00:38:17.712
(laughs)
<v ->The alveolar arches?</v>

850
00:38:17.712 --> 00:38:18.870
Yes.

851
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:20.296
This is the jaw bone.

852
00:38:20.296 --> 00:38:24.091
Alveolar arches refers to the bone in the

853
00:38:24.091 --> 00:38:25.780
masticate mandible of the jaw.

854
00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:26.604
<v Voiceover>That anchor your teeth.</v>

855
00:38:26.604 --> 00:38:28.382
<v ->That anchor the teeth.</v>

856
00:38:28.382 --> 00:38:31.713
And there's a curious thing that happens

857
00:38:31.713 --> 00:38:35.154
where circumscribed area of bone just die.

858
00:38:35.371 --> 00:38:38.824
And this is caused by thrombogenesis.

859
00:38:38.824 --> 00:38:42.319
It's caused by a thickening of this (mumbling) blood

860
00:38:42.319 --> 00:38:45.610
that doesn't allow circulation, and oxygenation,

861
00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:47.825
and nutrition to get to the bone,

862
00:38:47.825 --> 00:38:49.978
so areas of the bone die.

863
00:38:49.978 --> 00:38:53.128
And when they die all that's left is this

864
00:38:53.128 --> 00:38:57.299
trebicular architecture, this bony architecture.

865
00:38:57.597 --> 00:39:00.727
And the rest of the bone fills with

866
00:39:00.727 --> 00:39:04.525
microorganisms, posits, kind of a nasty thing.

867
00:39:04.525 --> 00:39:08.081
It turns out that it's not just a dental problem,

868
00:39:08.081 --> 00:39:10.154
but it's a systemic problem.

869
00:39:10.154 --> 00:39:12.042
There's a chemist, Boyd Haley,

870
00:39:12.042 --> 00:39:14.419
from The University of Kentucky,

871
00:39:14.419 --> 00:39:16.796
whose done a lot of research in this area

872
00:39:16.796 --> 00:39:20.190
of bio toxins, and he finds that the

873
00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:24.537
anoromic bacteria that live in these cavitations

874
00:39:24.537 --> 00:39:28.033
produce toxins that are 1000 times

875
00:39:28.033 --> 00:39:30.693
more toxic than the bothcoitem toxin,

876
00:39:30.693 --> 00:39:33.742
which is considered one of the most toxic

877
00:39:33.742 --> 00:39:34.981
substances in the world.

878
00:39:34.981 --> 00:39:35.834
<v Voiceover>This is frightening, this is truly</v>

879
00:39:35.834 --> 00:39:36.646
frightening.
<v ->It is.</v>

880
00:39:36.646 --> 00:39:38.151
<v Voiceover>And a lot of us have this going on</v>

881
00:39:38.151 --> 00:39:39.023
in our bodies.

882
00:39:39.023 --> 00:39:41.706
Which is really causing a degenerative effect

883
00:39:41.706 --> 00:39:43.413
in our entire health.

884
00:39:43.413 --> 00:39:44.307
<v ->It's true.</v>

885
00:39:44.307 --> 00:39:48.187
It's considered to be behind many neuro degenerative

886
00:39:48.187 --> 00:39:50.543
conditions, because these toxins have quite

887
00:39:50.543 --> 00:39:53.185
a high affinity for the nervous system.

888
00:39:53.185 --> 00:39:55.933
And so it's a big issue.

889
00:39:56.557 --> 00:39:59.279
The way that this condition is usually treated

890
00:39:59.279 --> 00:40:00.620
is with surgery.

891
00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:04.033
And it's an unpleasant surgery because

892
00:40:04.033 --> 00:40:05.760
it involves opening up the gums,

893
00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.854
and scraping away the dead bone,

894
00:40:07.854 --> 00:40:10.576
and waiting about a year for it to heal.

895
00:40:10.576 --> 00:40:13.237
So it's something that if there was an alternative

896
00:40:13.237 --> 00:40:14.883
would be wonderful.

897
00:40:14.883 --> 00:40:15.980
<v Voiceover>Is there, is there?</v>

898
00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.769
(laughs)
<v ->So I'm</v>

899
00:40:17.769 --> 00:40:19.231
pleased to tell you there is.

900
00:40:19.231 --> 00:40:21.912
And here's how this came up for me.

901
00:40:21.912 --> 00:40:24.919
About four years ago, three and a half years ago,

902
00:40:24.919 --> 00:40:27.804
my wife was not feeling well

903
00:40:27.804 --> 00:40:31.808
and we struggled to find out what the issue was.

904
00:40:31.808 --> 00:40:33.393
She had digestive problems,

905
00:40:33.393 --> 00:40:36.770
she wasn't sleeping well, she had night sweats,

906
00:40:36.906 --> 00:40:39.067
and fatigue.

907
00:40:39.202 --> 00:40:41.946
So we sent her to a dentist,

908
00:40:41.946 --> 00:40:45.297
Bob Stefan, in Spokane, Washington.

909
00:40:45.297 --> 00:40:49.362
And Bob has been a biological dentist for about 30 years

910
00:40:49.362 --> 00:40:51.982
and has a wonderful office.

911
00:40:51.982 --> 00:40:55.172
He has a machine called the Cavita machine.

912
00:40:55.172 --> 00:40:59.708
Now this is an FDA approved imaging machine.

913
00:41:00.047 --> 00:41:04.938
He uses ultra sound energy to

914
00:41:05.458 --> 00:41:10.207
identify the calcium content,

915
00:41:10.207 --> 00:41:12.177
the mineral content of the bone.

916
00:41:12.177 --> 00:41:16.057
Dead bone, obviously is much more porous,

917
00:41:16.057 --> 00:41:19.675
and less dense, than live, healthy bone.

918
00:41:20.165 --> 00:41:23.757
So he did the imaging study for Joann

919
00:41:23.757 --> 00:41:27.400
and found that she had four cavitations.

920
00:41:27.639 --> 00:41:29.650
And recommended that she have a surgery.

921
00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:32.270
Well, we had anticipated this on the basis

922
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:35.562
of our testing, and had a conversation about it,

923
00:41:35.562 --> 00:41:39.281
and decided that we'd use NMT

924
00:41:39.281 --> 00:41:43.471
to try to stimulate the body to heal the bone.

925
00:41:44.324 --> 00:41:46.513
He kind of chuckled in a kind way

926
00:41:46.513 --> 00:41:47.143
(laughs)
and he said,

927
00:41:47.143 --> 00:41:50.597
"You know, I've tried everything to heal these things.

928
00:41:50.597 --> 00:41:52.059
"I've used cold laser.

929
00:41:52.059 --> 00:41:56.103
"I've injected these things with homeopathics.

930
00:41:56.103 --> 00:41:57.260
"I've done everything you can do."

931
00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:59.312
And he says, "The best I've ever seen

932
00:41:59.312 --> 00:42:01.141
"is about a 10 or 20% improvement

933
00:42:01.141 --> 00:42:03.031
"over the period of a year."

934
00:42:03.031 --> 00:42:04.778
So we said okay.

935
00:42:04.778 --> 00:42:07.764
Let's try this and we'll do an imaging study

936
00:42:07.764 --> 00:42:11.685
again when our testing indicates it's time to do that.

937
00:42:11.685 --> 00:42:14.434
And if necessary, we'll have a surgery.

938
00:42:14.916 --> 00:42:17.333
So we worked for about four and a half months,

939
00:42:17.333 --> 00:42:19.101
using NMT.

940
00:42:19.101 --> 00:42:21.295
She went back to see Dr. Stefan

941
00:42:21.295 --> 00:42:24.160
and he again did the Cavitan study.

942
00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:27.107
All four of the cavitations had completely healed.

943
00:42:27.107 --> 00:42:27.979
<v Voiceover>That's amazing.</v>

944
00:42:27.979 --> 00:42:29.564
<v ->Isn't it amazing?
<v Voiceover>The bone back?</v>

945
00:42:29.564 --> 00:42:31.840
<v ->Bringing dead bone back to life.</v>

946
00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.688
<v Voiceover>Unbelievable.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

947
00:42:33.688 --> 00:42:35.558
We call it the Lazarus Treatment.

948
00:42:35.558 --> 00:42:37.163
<v Voiceover>Wow, yes. (laughs)</v>

949
00:42:37.163 --> 00:42:39.255
I can understand, that's incredible.

950
00:42:39.255 --> 00:42:41.796
<v ->So Dr. Stefan was so impressed with this,</v>

951
00:42:41.796 --> 00:42:42.832
he'd never seen it before,

952
00:42:42.832 --> 00:42:45.555
and to my knowledge there are no published studies

953
00:42:45.555 --> 00:42:48.175
of spontaneous healing of cavitations,

954
00:42:48.175 --> 00:42:52.705
that he offered to do 12

955
00:42:52.705 --> 00:42:57.587
pre and post studies on patients in a study.

956
00:42:58.842 --> 00:43:01.402
And we proceeded to do that,

957
00:43:01.402 --> 00:43:02.925
and we've just finished this study,

958
00:43:02.925 --> 00:43:07.788
and what we found is that 90%, just under 90%

959
00:43:07.984 --> 00:43:12.048
of our patients had complete healing of their cavitations.

960
00:43:12.048 --> 00:43:13.327
<v Voiceover>And we're showing a couple of these</v>

961
00:43:13.327 --> 00:43:15.116
before and afters right here.

962
00:43:15.116 --> 00:43:18.467
Here you can see this jaggedy area

963
00:43:18.467 --> 00:43:20.946
on these little portions of this slide

964
00:43:20.946 --> 00:43:23.404
are obviously where there's bone loss.

965
00:43:23.404 --> 00:43:25.400
<v Leslie>That's right.</v>
<v Voiceover>Cavitation.</v>

966
00:43:25.442 --> 00:43:28.505
And here we can see the bone having grown back,

967
00:43:28.505 --> 00:43:32.121
which is, this is, it's, well, it's an every day miracle.

968
00:43:32.121 --> 00:43:34.294
I don't know so every day, it's like, a miracle.

969
00:43:34.294 --> 00:43:34.925
<v Leslie>It is a miracle.</v>

970
00:43:34.925 --> 00:43:36.591
<v Voiceover>For what modern medicine has</v>

971
00:43:36.591 --> 00:43:39.009
been able to do up until now, this is incredible

972
00:43:39.009 --> 00:43:40.776
<v ->It is, it is.</v>

973
00:43:40.776 --> 00:43:43.194
One of the things you have to ask

974
00:43:43.194 --> 00:43:47.135
when you think about this neuro modulation method is

975
00:43:47.135 --> 00:43:50.813
if you can make any changes, in this way,

976
00:43:50.813 --> 00:43:52.621
what are the limits?

977
00:43:52.621 --> 00:43:55.730
That is, if you can dialogue with the portion

978
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:57.680
of the nervous system that controls the body

979
00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.427
and you can make it aware of the problems

980
00:43:59.427 --> 00:44:02.353
that it suffers from, that are causing it

981
00:44:02.353 --> 00:44:04.851
to create the illness in the body,

982
00:44:04.851 --> 00:44:06.619
then where are the limits?

983
00:44:06.619 --> 00:44:07.981
To be honest with you, I don't know

984
00:44:07.981 --> 00:44:09.850
where those limits are.

985
00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:11.353
We're seeing bone regrow,

986
00:44:11.353 --> 00:44:14.401
we're seeing, in a matter of minutes

987
00:44:14.401 --> 00:44:17.509
anaphylactic allergy corrected.

988
00:44:17.509 --> 00:44:21.979
One of the things that I do in the seminars that I teach,

989
00:44:21.979 --> 00:44:24.823
and I've taught about 60, or 65 seminars

990
00:44:24.823 --> 00:44:28.934
in the last five years, since 2002,

991
00:44:29.821 --> 00:44:33.763
is to ask if there's anybody in the audience

992
00:44:33.763 --> 00:44:36.404
of students taking the seminar,

993
00:44:36.404 --> 00:44:39.797
who has an anaphylactic response to a food.

994
00:44:39.797 --> 00:44:41.666
So in about half of our seminars,

995
00:44:41.666 --> 00:44:44.490
this is about 30, 35 seminars,

996
00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:47.660
we've had at least one, sometimes two,

997
00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:49.671
of those people in the audience.

998
00:44:49.671 --> 00:44:52.109
And these are often people not who

999
00:44:52.109 --> 00:44:55.415
get a little itchiness in the throat after they

1000
00:44:55.415 --> 00:44:57.270
eat a particular food.

1001
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:59.058
We're talking about these classic

1002
00:44:59.058 --> 00:45:01.821
anaphylactic allergies where the throat closes

1003
00:45:01.821 --> 00:45:03.303
and they have to be rushed to the hospital

1004
00:45:03.303 --> 00:45:06.276
or else they expire.

1005
00:45:07.367 --> 00:45:09.785
In every one of these cases,

1006
00:45:09.785 --> 00:45:11.614
where we brought a stranger from the audience

1007
00:45:11.614 --> 00:45:13.706
on stage, we've treated them with NMT

1008
00:45:13.706 --> 00:45:16.713
for the anaphylactic allergy,

1009
00:45:16.713 --> 00:45:19.314
what we've seen is that at the end of the treatment

1010
00:45:19.314 --> 00:45:21.244
they were able to eat the food and not a single

1011
00:45:21.244 --> 00:45:24.048
one of them had an allergic response.

1012
00:45:24.048 --> 00:45:24.982
<v Voiceover>How many of them will</v>

1013
00:45:24.982 --> 00:45:27.946
actually put that shrimp in their mouth?

1014
00:45:27.946 --> 00:45:29.005
(laughs)

1015
00:45:29.005 --> 00:45:30.346
<v ->Well you know. (laughs)</v>

1016
00:45:30.346 --> 00:45:31.910
<v Voiceover>I mean, if you think about that,</v>

1017
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:33.922
I was just trying to imagine that,

1018
00:45:33.922 --> 00:45:36.766
raising your hand, Yes I have that condition.

1019
00:45:36.766 --> 00:45:38.858
<v ->Some people are a little hesitant to do that.</v>

1020
00:45:38.858 --> 00:45:40.037
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->But,</v>

1021
00:45:40.037 --> 00:45:42.556
I'll tell you a story that's kind of interesting.

1022
00:45:42.556 --> 00:45:44.324
We had a chiropractor who was at a

1023
00:45:44.324 --> 00:45:48.306
seminar that we did in Las Vegas a couple of years ago.

1024
00:45:48.306 --> 00:45:51.048
And here's how severe his shrimp allergy was.

1025
00:45:51.048 --> 00:45:54.787
He was with a friend at a Benihana restaurant,

1026
00:45:54.787 --> 00:45:55.966
and you know at those restaurants--

1027
00:45:55.966 --> 00:45:57.266
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->they prepare</v>

1028
00:45:57.266 --> 00:45:58.566
food at the table.

1029
00:45:58.566 --> 00:46:01.614
So he and his friend had ordered something.

1030
00:46:01.614 --> 00:46:03.869
The people at the table next to them

1031
00:46:03.869 --> 00:46:05.697
had ordered shrimp.

1032
00:46:05.697 --> 00:46:07.871
And so they were stir frying the shrimp

1033
00:46:07.871 --> 00:46:10.756
and the steam, the smell, was enough to trigger

1034
00:46:10.756 --> 00:46:14.068
anaphlylaxis and he had to be rushed to the hospital.

1035
00:46:14.068 --> 00:46:14.962
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>
<v ->We treated</v>

1036
00:46:14.962 --> 00:46:16.201
that fellow to our seminar,

1037
00:46:16.201 --> 00:46:18.700
and he ate a plate of shrimp.

1038
00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.610
Had no reaction at all.

1039
00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:21.687
<v Voiceover>Isn't that amazing?</v>

1040
00:46:21.687 --> 00:46:23.007
<v ->It is.
(laughs)

1041
00:46:23.007 --> 00:46:24.572
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

1042
00:46:24.572 --> 00:46:25.933
You showed me a slide earlier

1043
00:46:25.933 --> 00:46:29.753
that really is just heart rending, to say the least,

1044
00:46:29.753 --> 00:46:30.748
of a little girl.

1045
00:46:30.748 --> 00:46:32.089
Can you just talk about,

1046
00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:33.633
we'll bring this picture up now.

1047
00:46:33.633 --> 00:46:35.563
What is going on with her face?

1048
00:46:35.563 --> 00:46:38.042
And, if you can describe that.

1049
00:46:38.042 --> 00:46:40.724
<v ->This little girl is two years old.</v>

1050
00:46:40.724 --> 00:46:45.011
And she's the patient of a Dr. John Zilliox

1051
00:46:45.011 --> 00:46:47.042
in Amherst, New York.

1052
00:46:47.042 --> 00:46:48.871
John came to our seminar,

1053
00:46:48.871 --> 00:46:51.065
it was, I think the third NMT seminar

1054
00:46:51.065 --> 00:46:54.850
that we taught back in the November of 2002.

1055
00:46:55.474 --> 00:46:57.993
This was one of his first patients.

1056
00:46:57.993 --> 00:47:00.227
And as you can see by the picture,

1057
00:47:00.227 --> 00:47:03.356
the hemangioma is quite severe,

1058
00:47:03.356 --> 00:47:05.245
there are large red areas that you see

1059
00:47:05.245 --> 00:47:06.505
standing off of the skin,

1060
00:47:06.505 --> 00:47:08.517
and you see that around the ear,

1061
00:47:08.517 --> 00:47:10.142
the swelling is so severe that

1062
00:47:10.142 --> 00:47:12.519
the ear is even closed off.

1063
00:47:12.519 --> 00:47:15.932
So the plan, the medical plan,

1064
00:47:15.932 --> 00:47:18.248
was to use a series of surgeries

1065
00:47:18.248 --> 00:47:21.032
and laser procedures to try to

1066
00:47:21.032 --> 00:47:23.110
help this little girl.

1067
00:47:23.917 --> 00:47:28.001
But these procedures hadn't been begun yet,

1068
00:47:28.001 --> 00:47:32.206
when she went in to see Dr. Zilliox,

1069
00:47:32.206 --> 00:47:35.152
and there were four treatments done,

1070
00:47:35.152 --> 00:47:37.164
four NMT treatments.

1071
00:47:37.164 --> 00:47:40.590
And what you see in the second picture is

1072
00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:45.717
January 1st, 2003, about five weeks after

1073
00:47:45.717 --> 00:47:47.810
he'd taken the seminar.

1074
00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:50.776
And what you see is about an 80% resolution

1075
00:47:50.776 --> 00:47:51.914
of the hemangioma.

1076
00:47:51.914 --> 00:47:53.458
<v Voiceover>This is just beautiful.</v>

1077
00:47:53.458 --> 00:47:55.022
<v ->Yeah, it's really wonderful.</v>

1078
00:47:55.022 --> 00:47:58.395
It's difficult to imagine that a surgical remedy

1079
00:47:58.395 --> 00:48:00.040
for the situation would produce as good.

1080
00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:00.894
<v Voiceover>Anything better.</v>

1081
00:48:00.894 --> 00:48:02.113
Oh, absolutely.

1082
00:48:02.113 --> 00:48:03.982
Well how long does it take for a person,

1083
00:48:03.982 --> 00:48:07.647
first of all, do the people that take your course,

1084
00:48:07.647 --> 00:48:10.788
are they all clinical practitioners of some kind already?

1085
00:48:10.788 --> 00:48:15.041
Are they mostly chiropractors, acupuncturist, dealers, or?

1086
00:48:15.278 --> 00:48:18.265
<v ->About a third of our practitioners are chiropractors.</v>

1087
00:48:18.265 --> 00:48:21.251
About a third are acupuncturists.

1088
00:48:21.251 --> 00:48:25.985
And about a third are a mix of medical doctors,

1089
00:48:25.985 --> 00:48:30.009
osteopaths, psychologists, quite a few psychologists

1090
00:48:30.009 --> 00:48:31.330
enjoy this work.

1091
00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:32.101
<v Voiceover>That's interesting.</v>

1092
00:48:32.101 --> 00:48:34.376
<v ->You can imagine that there's a resonance between</v>

1093
00:48:34.376 --> 00:48:38.829
the field of psychology, and what we've described

1094
00:48:38.829 --> 00:48:41.101
as the NMT system.

1095
00:48:41.101 --> 00:48:43.580
There are RNs who study our work.

1096
00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:47.359
So, a few massage therapists, but we're very selective

1097
00:48:47.359 --> 00:48:51.260
with the folks that we train.

1098
00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:56.420
<v Voiceover>You need to keep the clinical integrity</v>

1099
00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:58.777
intact there, so I can see why you'd want to.

1100
00:48:58.777 --> 00:49:00.158
<v ->It's important to do that</v>

1101
00:49:00.158 --> 00:49:03.308
and it's somewhat challenging work.

1102
00:49:03.308 --> 00:49:04.892
<v Voiceover>Right, right.</v>

1103
00:49:04.892 --> 00:49:08.184
Well you have trained, at this point, over 1000 people.

1104
00:49:08.184 --> 00:49:10.358
You have hundreds out there.

1105
00:49:10.358 --> 00:49:11.983
Other countries other than the US?

1106
00:49:11.983 --> 00:49:13.751
We have viewers from all over the world

1107
00:49:13.751 --> 00:49:15.112
watching this right now.

1108
00:49:15.112 --> 00:49:15.985
<v ->We do.</v>

1109
00:49:15.985 --> 00:49:20.299
We have practitioners throughout North and South America,

1110
00:49:21.329 --> 00:49:23.651
Europe, Asia.

1111
00:49:24.254 --> 00:49:27.099
We have a practitioner who's recently trained

1112
00:49:27.099 --> 00:49:29.923
from Turkey, actually a cardiac surgeon,

1113
00:49:29.923 --> 00:49:32.280
who was interested in the energetic medicine,

1114
00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:35.287
he came to a seminar that we taught in Newark

1115
00:49:35.287 --> 00:49:37.197
a few months ago.

1116
00:49:37.197 --> 00:49:39.472
So it's--
<v Voiceover>It's out there.</v>

1117
00:49:39.472 --> 00:49:40.406
<v ->It's out there.
<v Voiceover>Let me ask</v>

1118
00:49:40.406 --> 00:49:41.585
this one question.
<v ->Yes.</v>

1119
00:49:41.585 --> 00:49:42.418
<v Voiceover>This follow up.</v>

1120
00:49:42.418 --> 00:49:44.714
My understanding is once you begin

1121
00:49:44.714 --> 00:49:46.116
the process with someone

1122
00:49:46.116 --> 00:49:47.680
this can actually be done remotely

1123
00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.874
because it is working on the quantum field.

1124
00:49:49.874 --> 00:49:51.703
So it's not like you have to pop into an office

1125
00:49:51.703 --> 00:49:53.816
if it's three or 400 miles away.

1126
00:49:53.816 --> 00:49:55.177
<v ->It's true.</v>

1127
00:49:55.177 --> 00:49:57.209
It can be done on a remote basis.

1128
00:49:57.209 --> 00:49:59.890
Not all NMT practitioners practice

1129
00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:01.699
on a remote basis.

1130
00:50:01.699 --> 00:50:04.482
But it's just as effective on a remote basis

1131
00:50:04.482 --> 00:50:07.917
as it is on an in office basis.

1132
00:50:07.917 --> 00:50:10.496
It's a little difficult to imagine

1133
00:50:10.496 --> 00:50:14.661
that that could be so, but as we discussed earlier,

1134
00:50:14.661 --> 00:50:17.221
with Dean Radin's experiment, it shows

1135
00:50:17.221 --> 00:50:20.925
us this entanglement of minds that.

1136
00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.077
<v Voiceover>Beyond time and space.</v>

1137
00:50:22.077 --> 00:50:24.007
<v ->It's beyond time and space.</v>

1138
00:50:24.007 --> 00:50:28.131
So the information that needs to be transmitted

1139
00:50:28.131 --> 00:50:31.016
can be transmitted no matter where

1140
00:50:31.016 --> 00:50:34.714
a person is relative to the practitioner.

1141
00:50:34.714 --> 00:50:36.298
<v Voiceover>Can even the very initial session</v>

1142
00:50:36.298 --> 00:50:39.001
be done remotely so the whole thing can be done remotely?

1143
00:50:39.001 --> 00:50:40.789
Or is it best to see someone intially

1144
00:50:40.789 --> 00:50:42.962
and then maybe go remote, or?

1145
00:50:42.962 --> 00:50:46.030
<v ->My preference is to see somebody on a local basis</v>

1146
00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:48.448
first, but it's not always practical.

1147
00:50:48.448 --> 00:50:50.114
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>
<v ->And the</v>

1148
00:50:50.114 --> 00:50:53.893
result is that a large number of the people that I treat

1149
00:50:53.893 --> 00:50:55.620
I've never met.

1150
00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:57.408
They send me a picture,

1151
00:50:57.408 --> 00:50:59.358
they complete our paperwork so that we have

1152
00:50:59.358 --> 00:51:01.045
a good history for them.

1153
00:51:01.045 --> 00:51:04.332
And otherwise, everything else transpires

1154
00:51:04.332 --> 00:51:07.140
as we're on the phone together.

1155
00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:09.781
<v Voiceover>Well, it doesn't come much more elegant,</v>

1156
00:51:09.781 --> 00:51:12.950
direct, simple, beautiful, than that does it?

1157
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:14.982
<v ->I don't think so.
(laughs)

1158
00:51:14.982 --> 00:51:16.912
<v Voiceover>Thank you so much for your time,</v>

1159
00:51:16.912 --> 00:51:19.513
and I'm going to be giving you a call. (laughs)

1160
00:51:19.513 --> 00:51:21.591
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1161
00:51:22.797 --> 00:51:24.970
<v ->Anecdotally I had a problem with my shoulder</v>

1162
00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:26.800
for over a year, which stopped me from

1163
00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.405
doing a lot of things that I love.

1164
00:51:28.405 --> 00:51:30.680
In five minutes with Les, five minutes,

1165
00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:32.122
all of the strength was back,

1166
00:51:32.122 --> 00:51:34.763
and I was both shocked, and of course, happy.

1167
00:51:34.763 --> 00:51:36.287
To learn more about NMT

1168
00:51:36.287 --> 00:51:37.750
and to find a practitioner near you,

1169
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:40.005
go to his website by clicking on the link below.

1170
00:51:40.005 --> 00:51:42.856
Until next time, thanks for watching.
