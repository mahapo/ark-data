(mysterious and pensive synthesizer music)

00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:19.914
<v ->In our previous interview with Philip Coppens,</v>

3
00:00:19.914 --> 00:00:22.649
we spoke about the ancient alien question.

4
00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:24.746
I find this subject not only fascinating,

5
00:00:24.746 --> 00:00:26.452
but critical to understand,

6
00:00:26.452 --> 00:00:29.630
because the human species is beginning to ask new questions

7
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.849
as to our origins and as to the presence

8
00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.496
of extraterrestrial life on Earth.

9
00:00:34.496 --> 00:00:37.184
In this interview, Philip speaks of Erich von Daniken's

10
00:00:37.184 --> 00:00:39.744
newest book titled Odyssey of the Gods.

11
00:00:39.744 --> 00:00:42.961
In these pages, von Daniken speaks of the notion

12
00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:45.519
that what the Greeks called gods were in fact

13
00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.544
advanced beings that had been in a ruling position

14
00:00:48.544 --> 00:00:51.432
for millennia, back to the time of Atlantis,

15
00:00:51.432 --> 00:00:53.046
which Plato speaks of.

16
00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:54.709
This brings a new light to the subject

17
00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:57.456
of Greek mythology and our history.

18
00:00:58.828 --> 00:01:00.748
Philip, I'm so happy you were able to talk to me

19
00:01:00.748 --> 00:01:03.707
on behalf of Erich because he's up in his 70s now,

20
00:01:03.707 --> 00:01:06.209
and outside of Ancient Aliens, he's really not found

21
00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:08.107
or out and about much on camera anymore,

22
00:01:08.107 --> 00:01:10.635
and you have worked very intimately together.

23
00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:13.621
You have not only a similar basis of information,

24
00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:16.129
but you actually edited this book.

25
00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:20.086
And so, as a surrogate for him,

26
00:01:20.086 --> 00:01:23.208
and also you have so much texture to add on your own,

27
00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:25.891
I'm intrigued because to me,

28
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:28.002
mythology never had a big place.

29
00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:30.049
I mean, for a lot of people, they live for mythology.

30
00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:31.679
I'd make up my own stories.

31
00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.305
So, we're learning as the decades go on,

32
00:01:34.305 --> 00:01:36.046
mythology is there for a reason.

33
00:01:36.046 --> 00:01:40.076
It's based on something, and Odyssey of the Gods,

34
00:01:40.076 --> 00:01:41.798
can you give us an idea first of all,

35
00:01:41.798 --> 00:01:43.644
a kind of round perspective

36
00:01:43.644 --> 00:01:46.735
on why Erich chose to write this book?

37
00:01:46.735 --> 00:01:48.200
<v ->Well, I think there are two reasons.</v>

38
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.861
One of them is that today we do see

39
00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:54.024
as if these mythologies, these Greek legends,

40
00:01:54.024 --> 00:01:57.096
are ancient science fiction, and they're not.

41
00:01:57.096 --> 00:01:59.580
That is precisely what Erich is trying to do.

42
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.928
But also, Erich throughout his life,

43
00:02:01.928 --> 00:02:05.172
has really been focusing so much on obscure places.

44
00:02:05.172 --> 00:02:08.653
Places where probably nobody would ever be able to go.

45
00:02:08.653 --> 00:02:12.007
Unknown caves in the deepest parts of Ecuador.

46
00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:14.190
Nobody can follow him there, but each one of us,

47
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.134
and specifically his European audience,

48
00:02:16.134 --> 00:02:17.645
is able to go to Greece.

49
00:02:17.645 --> 00:02:19.149
We've also grown up with Greece,

50
00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:21.399
we really feel that Greece is part of us.

51
00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:24.198
We see Greece as this cradle of civilization,

52
00:02:24.198 --> 00:02:27.138
we feel that Greece is there and always has been,

53
00:02:27.138 --> 00:02:28.728
that they are like us.

54
00:02:28.728 --> 00:02:31.588
And guess what, they are not really.

55
00:02:31.588 --> 00:02:33.434
And that is really what Erich is trying to do

56
00:02:33.434 --> 00:02:35.791
with his book of Odyssey of the Gods.

57
00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:39.615
He's trying to make this clear that

58
00:02:39.615 --> 00:02:41.757
what we think we know about the ancient Greeks

59
00:02:41.757 --> 00:02:45.651
really is not at all what we think is the case here.

60
00:02:45.651 --> 00:02:47.891
So, whereas we think that the ancient Greeks

61
00:02:47.891 --> 00:02:50.056
were rational people, whereas we think

62
00:02:50.056 --> 00:02:53.683
that they were very much into these myths

63
00:02:53.683 --> 00:02:56.371
which were kinda like, as I said, ancient science fiction.

64
00:02:56.371 --> 00:02:59.671
What they really are is a memory,

65
00:02:59.671 --> 00:03:01.089
something which they feel that have

66
00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:02.891
to share with their people.

67
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:05.131
And so, Greece is at this threshold,

68
00:03:05.131 --> 00:03:06.604
a very interesting threshold,

69
00:03:06.604 --> 00:03:10.994
between prehistory and history, because even though

70
00:03:10.994 --> 00:03:13.164
obviously the ancient Egyptians, the Sumerians,

71
00:03:13.164 --> 00:03:15.547
so many cultures were writing before,

72
00:03:15.547 --> 00:03:18.468
with the Greeks what we have is this volume of material.

73
00:03:18.468 --> 00:03:20.452
We really have hundreds if not thousands

74
00:03:20.452 --> 00:03:23.775
of written pages about what they're talking about.

75
00:03:23.775 --> 00:03:26.360
And the very first thing we do,

76
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.719
is when we enter the part of history,

77
00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:29.891
is that we're beginning to say,

78
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:33.340
"Well, all of that is not true, it's not fiction."

79
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.129
So it's not something

80
00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.305
which we should be considering as history.

81
00:03:37.305 --> 00:03:38.629
And Erich is going into that,

82
00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.413
and really saying, "Um, be careful here."

83
00:03:41.413 --> 00:03:44.212
because really what we are saying is that

84
00:03:44.212 --> 00:03:47.407
this is part of prehistory, this isn't science fiction.

85
00:03:47.407 --> 00:03:49.676
This is something which was written down

86
00:03:49.676 --> 00:03:52.568
because the ancient Greeks felt it was important.

87
00:03:52.568 --> 00:03:55.229
This is something which they considered to be real,

88
00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:57.733
considered to be part of their history,

89
00:03:57.733 --> 00:03:59.834
and hence, why we have labeled

90
00:03:59.834 --> 00:04:02.447
this category of legends and myths,

91
00:04:02.447 --> 00:04:04.367
which again, we treat as science fiction,

92
00:04:04.367 --> 00:04:05.892
but definitely the Greeks didn't.

93
00:04:05.892 --> 00:04:07.727
<v Regina>And we have to probably take</v>

94
00:04:07.727 --> 00:04:09.645
into consideration here also,

95
00:04:09.645 --> 00:04:12.410
that while there were many documents

96
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.506
that were left behind by the Greeks,

97
00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:17.807
at the same time, some of their tradition

98
00:04:17.807 --> 00:04:20.988
was also inherited through the Egyptian lineage.

99
00:04:20.988 --> 00:04:23.193
A lot of the gods we know through the Egyptian lineage

100
00:04:23.193 --> 00:04:25.113
simply have a change of names in through

101
00:04:25.113 --> 00:04:27.956
the Greek era and then the Roman era.

102
00:04:27.956 --> 00:04:30.564
And so, this is passed on,

103
00:04:30.564 --> 00:04:33.693
very highly documented information.

104
00:04:33.693 --> 00:04:36.218
One part of Erich's book was saying that

105
00:04:36.218 --> 00:04:38.053
the Greeks had already,

106
00:04:38.053 --> 00:04:40.971
the legend was full within the culture.

107
00:04:40.971 --> 00:04:43.368
Some of the direct memories were beginning to fade

108
00:04:43.368 --> 00:04:45.406
that they had been able to glean a lot

109
00:04:45.406 --> 00:04:47.587
from the Egyptians prior to them.

110
00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:49.865
And one thing that keeps coming through is,

111
00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:54.632
give us a definition of what the gods actually are,

112
00:04:54.632 --> 00:04:56.265
because Erich spends a lot of time on this.

113
00:04:56.265 --> 00:04:58.847
<v ->(chuckles) Well, you know the gods in a nutshell</v>

114
00:04:58.847 --> 00:05:02.227
is somebody who is higher than us.

115
00:05:02.227 --> 00:05:04.507
Somebody who was able to do certain things

116
00:05:04.507 --> 00:05:07.903
which none of us were allegedly able to do.

117
00:05:07.903 --> 00:05:10.526
And to actually jump civilization a bit,

118
00:05:10.526 --> 00:05:13.608
and go to The Bible, we think that The Bible

119
00:05:13.608 --> 00:05:16.889
is all about morality, that every story there is

120
00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.442
is supposed to be saying something about what "God" is.

121
00:05:20.442 --> 00:05:22.349
And when you actually start looking at The Bible,

122
00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.118
you're beginning to see that some of these things

123
00:05:24.118 --> 00:05:26.891
are just stories which the Jews had with them

124
00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:29.611
which said, "Well, this is interesting."

125
00:05:29.611 --> 00:05:30.891
This shows you that there is more

126
00:05:30.891 --> 00:05:33.934
to this framework than anything else.

127
00:05:33.934 --> 00:05:36.512
And so the same thing is happening in ancient Greece

128
00:05:36.512 --> 00:05:41.204
whereby they're actually saying, "Well, this is about gods,

129
00:05:41.204 --> 00:05:43.893
"but we don't mean God with a big G necessarily."

130
00:05:43.893 --> 00:05:47.135
We're meaning here a class of beings who are

131
00:05:47.135 --> 00:05:52.035
of another realm, of another extraordinary capability,

132
00:05:52.035 --> 00:05:54.090
even within the physical realm.

133
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.937
And then you have the heroes.

134
00:05:55.937 --> 00:05:57.176
Then you have those people

135
00:05:57.176 --> 00:06:01.290
who are somehow simply identified through lineage

136
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.497
as being deemed to be descendants of these creatures

137
00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:07.441
who were at one point here on planet earth.

138
00:06:07.441 --> 00:06:10.272
And so, what you have in the Greek mythology

139
00:06:10.272 --> 00:06:14.556
is stories of heroes, and Erich starts off with Jason.

140
00:06:14.556 --> 00:06:18.416
Jason is this guy who is of royal descent,

141
00:06:18.416 --> 00:06:19.857
who knows certain things,

142
00:06:19.857 --> 00:06:21.937
and together with a bunch of his mates,

143
00:06:21.937 --> 00:06:24.283
he is able to gather them all around and say,

144
00:06:24.283 --> 00:06:27.810
"OK, let's go to this place,

145
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.394
"and in this place,we are actually going to find

146
00:06:30.394 --> 00:06:32.278
"something which is extraordinary,

147
00:06:32.278 --> 00:06:34.133
"something called the Golden Fleece."

148
00:06:34.133 --> 00:06:36.189
Then Erich says, "OK, what is the Golden Fleece?

149
00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:39.687
"What do we know about this artifact?"

150
00:06:39.687 --> 00:06:41.438
When you start reading the modern translations,

151
00:06:41.438 --> 00:06:44.151
what you actually have is that it pretty much seems

152
00:06:44.151 --> 00:06:45.841
to be nothing more or less than,

153
00:06:45.841 --> 00:06:47.746
as he calls it, a piece of fur.

154
00:06:47.746 --> 00:06:51.409
And so, why would a few dozens of people,

155
00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:55.398
50 in the end, be interested in a piece of fur?

156
00:06:56.218 --> 00:06:58.272
What Erich does is he begins to go into it,

157
00:06:58.272 --> 00:06:59.909
he begins to translate, he begins

158
00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:02.269
to really come to the core of this.

159
00:07:02.269 --> 00:07:05.285
And he realizes that Jason is talking

160
00:07:05.285 --> 00:07:07.130
about something completely differently.

161
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.510
It's not a piece of fur,

162
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.220
it's something which he knows about,

163
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.149
an artifact which allegedly is able to fly,

164
00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:18.228
and he wants it because of that very capability.

165
00:07:18.228 --> 00:07:20.001
There are people around him who are going to

166
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:22.156
go with him and say, "Um, excuse me.

167
00:07:22.156 --> 00:07:23.861
"I think I'm probably a person who is able

168
00:07:23.861 --> 00:07:28.106
"to fly or navigate or pilot this object."

169
00:07:28.106 --> 00:07:31.306
And so they say, "Yep, you can come along as well."

170
00:07:31.306 --> 00:07:33.609
At the end what you have is 50 people

171
00:07:33.609 --> 00:07:38.505
who go off in search of an artifact which is able to fly.

172
00:07:39.355 --> 00:07:42.580
The reason why Jason is interested with this

173
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.222
or takes up this mission, is because he knew about this

174
00:07:46.222 --> 00:07:48.298
through various traditions of saying,

175
00:07:48.298 --> 00:07:50.816
"OK, this was something left behind by the gods.

176
00:07:50.816 --> 00:07:52.651
"This was something which was there."

177
00:07:52.651 --> 00:07:57.306
So what we have is, family history if you want

178
00:07:57.306 --> 00:08:00.577
of artifacts which at one point were here on planet earth,

179
00:08:00.577 --> 00:08:02.443
or are still here on planet earth,

180
00:08:02.443 --> 00:08:03.691
and descendants of that lineage

181
00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:06.080
going in search of them and feeling comfortable

182
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.190
that they will be able to recover them

183
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.839
and take them with them.

184
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:13.380
And that is far different from this idea

185
00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.720
that somehow we have ancient authors

186
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.933
who are going to write about deities as morality lessons.

187
00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:23.256
There is really no morality lesson

188
00:08:23.256 --> 00:08:25.158
in Jason and the Argonauts.

189
00:08:25.158 --> 00:08:27.343
I mean, there might be some morality lessons,

190
00:08:27.343 --> 00:08:28.305
as in stick together-

191
00:08:28.305 --> 00:08:29.523
<v Regina>Plus, it's an adventure.</v>

192
00:08:29.523 --> 00:08:33.107
<v ->Yes, stick together, but it is not written as such.</v>

193
00:08:33.107 --> 00:08:36.298
It is written because it's an extraordinary account

194
00:08:36.298 --> 00:08:39.721
by the ancient Greek people, for the ancient Greek people

195
00:08:39.721 --> 00:08:42.268
saying this is somewhere between us

196
00:08:42.268 --> 00:08:45.110
and somewhere between our ancestors, the gods.

197
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.761
This is kind of like what happened then,

198
00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:49.130
what some of our ancestors were doing.

199
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:53.355
That I think is something which is very new

200
00:08:53.355 --> 00:08:56.823
and a new take on the ancient Greek accounts.

201
00:08:56.823 --> 00:08:59.257
<v Regina>And you talk about hybridization</v>

202
00:08:59.257 --> 00:09:01.385
within this story quite a bit as well.

203
00:09:01.385 --> 00:09:04.469
And this is something where we start looking very directly

204
00:09:04.469 --> 00:09:07.733
to the story of, that you've written about as well,

205
00:09:07.733 --> 00:09:10.635
Ancient Aliens, our last month's interview.

206
00:09:10.635 --> 00:09:13.110
The Ancient Alien Question, and many many,

207
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.024
I mean hundreds of books have been written

208
00:09:15.024 --> 00:09:17.597
on the subject of whether or not ancient aliens

209
00:09:17.597 --> 00:09:20.030
and aliens did exist, and he is saying essentially

210
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.005
that those beings that came here,

211
00:09:23.005 --> 00:09:26.088
of which there is evidence for throughout history,

212
00:09:26.088 --> 00:09:28.305
physically and in literature,

213
00:09:28.305 --> 00:09:32.273
did exist and are the basis for the hybridized humans.

214
00:09:33.423 --> 00:09:36.147
Like Jason and the Argonauts, these are the best of,

215
00:09:36.147 --> 00:09:39.441
these are superhuman young men

216
00:09:39.441 --> 00:09:41.529
that gathered together that had traits

217
00:09:41.529 --> 00:09:44.178
beyond what the populace had from what I understand.

218
00:09:44.178 --> 00:09:45.479
Is that correct?

219
00:09:45.479 --> 00:09:48.340
<v ->That's definitely in the same tradition.</v>

220
00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.017
Again, as in The Bible, as in so many other cultures,

221
00:09:51.017 --> 00:09:54.827
you have, not all cultures, but definitely Greek culture

222
00:09:54.827 --> 00:09:57.408
has this idea that the gods were here

223
00:09:57.408 --> 00:09:59.372
and that they intermingled with us.

224
00:09:59.372 --> 00:10:01.650
That somehow we are,

225
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.350
not necessarily an experiment by them,

226
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.486
not necessarily some lab experiment.

227
00:10:06.486 --> 00:10:08.133
But that definitely that the gods

228
00:10:08.133 --> 00:10:12.400
couldn't keep certain things away from our ancestors,

229
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.270
and that the end result of this was,

230
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:17.172
that there were this kind of hybrid species.

231
00:10:17.172 --> 00:10:19.359
Some of which reached out, some of which

232
00:10:19.359 --> 00:10:21.930
may not have been able to procreate to begin with,

233
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.836
but also, definitely according to the Greek traditions,

234
00:10:24.836 --> 00:10:28.993
that there were these descendants living amongst us,

235
00:10:28.993 --> 00:10:31.164
or to some extent, that we were

236
00:10:31.164 --> 00:10:33.579
descendants of these beings as well.

237
00:10:33.579 --> 00:10:35.740
There are various traditions.

238
00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.094
Like with the war of the titans, there is,

239
00:10:38.094 --> 00:10:40.867
if you go into the minutia, you really can get lost

240
00:10:40.867 --> 00:10:43.928
because there are diverging ideas

241
00:10:43.928 --> 00:10:46.765
as to who precisely was descended from who,

242
00:10:46.765 --> 00:10:48.866
and obviously as time goes on,

243
00:10:48.866 --> 00:10:51.394
this becomes a far more difficult picture.

244
00:10:51.394 --> 00:10:54.883
But the overall conclusion and the one important conclusion,

245
00:10:54.883 --> 00:10:58.759
is that the gods were sexually active

246
00:10:58.759 --> 00:11:01.753
with people of this planet.
<v Regina>Humans.</v>

247
00:11:01.753 --> 00:11:05.389
<v Philip>And that definitely there were heroes as a result</v>

248
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:07.953
who were definitely at one point amongst us,

249
00:11:07.953 --> 00:11:09.615
and did extraordinary things.

250
00:11:09.615 --> 00:11:12.629
And that, to some extent, we also

251
00:11:12.629 --> 00:11:16.293
carry this gene amongst us.

252
00:11:16.293 --> 00:11:19.997
Some of it more powerful than others,

253
00:11:19.997 --> 00:11:23.418
and very much like the idea of, are there descendants?

254
00:11:23.418 --> 00:11:25.178
If Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married,

255
00:11:25.178 --> 00:11:26.279
are there descendants?

256
00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:29.107
And the answer is, yes, if they were married,

257
00:11:29.107 --> 00:11:32.275
there are millions of us who carry this gene.

258
00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:34.756
And the same is really true for anything else,

259
00:11:34.756 --> 00:11:36.187
except that you are confronted

260
00:11:36.187 --> 00:11:39.066
with thousands and thousands of more years

261
00:11:39.066 --> 00:11:41.872
at what point this was happening.

262
00:11:41.872 --> 00:11:44.812
So, this idea that we are a hybrid species

263
00:11:44.812 --> 00:11:48.705
is definitely, once again, something which the Greeks

264
00:11:48.705 --> 00:11:51.645
seem to have been, but at some point also,

265
00:11:51.645 --> 00:11:53.450
don't seem to have been, aware of.

266
00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.068
And specifically, the importance of why people

267
00:11:56.068 --> 00:11:57.482
like Homer and various other people

268
00:11:57.482 --> 00:11:59.842
are beginning to write down these myths,

269
00:11:59.842 --> 00:12:03.642
is because they want to educate, teach their own people

270
00:12:03.642 --> 00:12:06.200
into saying, "This is how it happened.

271
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.125
"You might not know this, you might not remember this,

272
00:12:08.125 --> 00:12:10.166
"but this is really the way it was,

273
00:12:10.166 --> 00:12:12.577
"and here it is on a plate, offered to you,

274
00:12:12.577 --> 00:12:15.264
"for everybody to read and to remember where we came from."

275
00:12:15.264 --> 00:12:17.915
<v Regina>Yeah, a wonderful gift to pass down.</v>

276
00:12:17.915 --> 00:12:19.843
And now we have people like Erich and yourself

277
00:12:19.843 --> 00:12:22.308
and others who are even expanding on it from other texts

278
00:12:22.308 --> 00:12:24.825
that, of course, Homer didn't have access to at the time.

279
00:12:24.825 --> 00:12:26.683
And one of the things that keeps popping up

280
00:12:26.683 --> 00:12:30.150
among these hybrids are also these

281
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.223
species that, like a centaur for example,

282
00:12:33.223 --> 00:12:36.795
where you're looking at crossbreeding between species.

283
00:12:36.795 --> 00:12:38.639
This comes up in the work of other people,

284
00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:41.038
such as Dolores Cannon, and a lot of the people

285
00:12:41.038 --> 00:12:45.002
that she's put under hypnosis in the times of Atlantis.

286
00:12:45.002 --> 00:12:47.101
What she does go into, and we'll,

287
00:12:47.101 --> 00:12:48.614
I want to go into that in a bit,

288
00:12:48.614 --> 00:12:50.714
and also the subject of giants.

289
00:12:50.714 --> 00:12:53.265
In fact, I wrote this down here,

290
00:12:53.265 --> 00:12:55.551
they spoke of, there was said to have been

291
00:12:55.551 --> 00:12:59.087
4,090,000 giants .

292
00:12:59.087 --> 00:13:02.417
that had existed on the earth at one time

293
00:13:04.197 --> 00:13:06.102
Put that into some kind of perspective for us.

294
00:13:06.102 --> 00:13:08.445
When you were looking at gods, are the gods the giants?

295
00:13:08.445 --> 00:13:10.705
Are the giants the hybrid offspring

296
00:13:10.705 --> 00:13:13.548
of humans and ETs, so to speak?

297
00:13:14.748 --> 00:13:17.041
<v ->There definitely seems to be the case, and again,</v>

298
00:13:17.041 --> 00:13:19.051
let's go back to The Bible because it's something

299
00:13:19.051 --> 00:13:21.501
which everybody is quite familiar with.

300
00:13:21.501 --> 00:13:24.474
You have a very normal story there about how,

301
00:13:24.474 --> 00:13:26.254
basically, the gods come from above,

302
00:13:26.254 --> 00:13:28.686
see the beauty of ,

303
00:13:28.686 --> 00:13:31.336
the female gender of mankind,

304
00:13:31.336 --> 00:13:32.780
decides to mate with it,

305
00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.258
and in The BIble, you have very specific information

306
00:13:36.258 --> 00:13:38.468
about how the end result of this

307
00:13:38.468 --> 00:13:41.730
is something which has gigantic heads, which is larger.

308
00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:43.226
Which actually means that women

309
00:13:43.226 --> 00:13:45.619
who tried to give birth to this, some of them died.

310
00:13:45.619 --> 00:13:48.887
Sometimes both child and mother died,

311
00:13:48.887 --> 00:13:52.365
but in some instances, our ancestors began to realize

312
00:13:52.365 --> 00:13:54.785
that by applying a Caesarean section,

313
00:13:54.785 --> 00:13:57.545
everything will be better, will be OK

314
00:13:57.545 --> 00:14:00.105
for both mother and child.

315
00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:02.886
Now, when you jump forward in time,

316
00:14:02.886 --> 00:14:04.746
you actually see that when Moses

317
00:14:04.746 --> 00:14:07.579
is running around ancient Israel,

318
00:14:07.579 --> 00:14:09.539
and is trying to get to Jerusalem,

319
00:14:09.539 --> 00:14:13.110
he gets confronted with tribe upon tribe upon tribe

320
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:16.256
who are descendants of these giants.

321
00:14:16.976 --> 00:14:19.127
Raphaeim, they have all various names,

322
00:14:19.127 --> 00:14:21.143
and to a large extent,

323
00:14:21.143 --> 00:14:24.471
they are all descendants of these species.

324
00:14:24.471 --> 00:14:28.791
And you also see that even though they're quite identical,

325
00:14:28.791 --> 00:14:32.137
they also have very specific things in the sense that

326
00:14:32.137 --> 00:14:35.178
it seems almost as if the more they inbred,

327
00:14:35.178 --> 00:14:40.034
the purer the giant genome remained

328
00:14:40.034 --> 00:14:43.647
whereas if you really start being looser

329
00:14:43.647 --> 00:14:46.751
with your tribe boundaries, the more human,

330
00:14:46.751 --> 00:14:50.636
the more like us the end result seemed to have become.

331
00:14:50.636 --> 00:14:52.746
And the same things seems to have happened

332
00:14:52.746 --> 00:14:55.183
in Greece, though again,

333
00:14:55.183 --> 00:14:58.399
the Greeks have all of this information indirectly.

334
00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:01.628
As you were saying, they are a species with amnesia.

335
00:15:01.628 --> 00:15:04.609
Something happened in Greece which is very interesting,

336
00:15:04.609 --> 00:15:07.201
and it happens throughout the Mediterranean basin.

337
00:15:07.201 --> 00:15:10.943
Roughly around 1500, 1200 B.C.,

338
00:15:10.943 --> 00:15:13.348
Thera exploded and it made the end

339
00:15:13.348 --> 00:15:15.343
of the Minoan civilization.

340
00:15:15.343 --> 00:15:17.508
And because it was so close to Greece,

341
00:15:17.508 --> 00:15:19.761
the same thing seems to have applied to Greece.

342
00:15:19.761 --> 00:15:23.340
You see that places like Mycenia and various other places

343
00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:27.547
were just completely pushed back into literally a dark age.

344
00:15:27.547 --> 00:15:30.535
And for several centuries, they remain in that state,

345
00:15:30.535 --> 00:15:34.011
and then in 900, 800 B.C.,

346
00:15:34.011 --> 00:15:35.556
the Greeks slowly begin to crawl

347
00:15:35.556 --> 00:15:37.666
out of this and enter history

348
00:15:37.666 --> 00:15:39.904
The official first date of the written source,

349
00:15:39.904 --> 00:15:44.531
for Greek history is the Olympic games in the 9th century.

350
00:15:44.531 --> 00:15:48.945
So, what you have is this threshold of 300 years

351
00:15:48.945 --> 00:15:52.140
in which the Greeks have forgotten what happened,

352
00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.504
and it is precisely why these myths are being formed

353
00:15:55.504 --> 00:15:58.448
and why they are being informed later

354
00:15:58.448 --> 00:16:00.728
when some of the Greeks go to Egypt,

355
00:16:00.728 --> 00:16:01.726
and they're being told

356
00:16:01.726 --> 00:16:03.634
so many things about their own history.

357
00:16:03.634 --> 00:16:05.961
And they're basically told that they are a species

358
00:16:05.961 --> 00:16:08.514
in amnesia, and that these are the things

359
00:16:08.514 --> 00:16:10.033
which they have forgotten.

360
00:16:10.033 --> 00:16:12.647
So, what we're confronted with here

361
00:16:12.647 --> 00:16:17.302
is 300 years of amnesia as such,

362
00:16:17.302 --> 00:16:20.430
but also a larger period of time before that

363
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.452
where you really have to push it even further back in time.

364
00:16:23.452 --> 00:16:26.108
So you have this layering, if that makes sense,

365
00:16:26.108 --> 00:16:29.651
of Greek history, so you have a period of 800 onwards

366
00:16:29.651 --> 00:16:32.836
which we would consider to be ancient Greece as we know it,

367
00:16:32.836 --> 00:16:36.587
then a push to roughly 1200 B.C.,

368
00:16:36.587 --> 00:16:39.493
which is like what I would call prehistory of Greece,

369
00:16:39.493 --> 00:16:41.948
but which now is becoming more and more history

370
00:16:41.948 --> 00:16:43.943
because of the Minoan civilization.

371
00:16:43.943 --> 00:16:46.804
And then, really we are talking about the period

372
00:16:46.804 --> 00:16:50.124
before that when the gods were there.

373
00:16:50.124 --> 00:16:51.944
When really all of this was happening.

374
00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:54.211
When the interbreeding was happening,

375
00:16:54.211 --> 00:16:57.251
and then how slowly prehistory,

376
00:16:57.251 --> 00:16:59.309
the Minoan civilization, Mycenia

377
00:16:59.309 --> 00:17:02.469
is really being played out on Greece.

378
00:17:02.469 --> 00:17:05.113
And so, you have really, a layering of things.

379
00:17:05.113 --> 00:17:07.906
It's like the ancient Greeks do not have to remember

380
00:17:07.906 --> 00:17:10.944
a period before the dark ages,

381
00:17:10.944 --> 00:17:14.005
but they really have to remember a period even before that,

382
00:17:14.005 --> 00:17:18.027
and that is really the hardship of this entire problem

383
00:17:18.027 --> 00:17:21.470
as to why we have grown up with an image of Greece

384
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:24.348
which is completely different from anything else.

385
00:17:24.348 --> 00:17:26.774
Why we think this is ancient science fiction,

386
00:17:26.774 --> 00:17:30.065
because it's pretty much as if

387
00:17:30.065 --> 00:17:32.189
any family is not trying to tell you something

388
00:17:32.189 --> 00:17:35.049
about your grandfather or your great-grandfather,

389
00:17:35.049 --> 00:17:38.193
but about what happened two centuries before that.

390
00:17:38.193 --> 00:17:39.412
And for two centuries, your family

391
00:17:39.412 --> 00:17:40.949
hasn't said anything about it.

392
00:17:40.949 --> 00:17:43.232
It's the kind of stuff Hollywood movies are made of.

393
00:17:43.232 --> 00:17:44.287
<v Regina>It is indeed.</v>

394
00:17:44.287 --> 00:17:47.428
And why is it do you think that history,

395
00:17:47.428 --> 00:17:49.259
Western history in particular,

396
00:17:49.259 --> 00:17:53.810
is very eager to embrace anything that came out of Greece,

397
00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.563
yet not at all eager to embrace what came prior,

398
00:17:56.563 --> 00:17:58.825
for example, out of Egypt, why is this?

399
00:17:59.575 --> 00:18:01.844
<v ->Because again, we think that we own them.</v>

400
00:18:01.844 --> 00:18:03.145
We think that they were like us.

401
00:18:03.145 --> 00:18:06.005
We think that they're rational and we think that,

402
00:18:06.005 --> 00:18:08.309
you know, they didn't believe any of these things.

403
00:18:08.309 --> 00:18:11.632
And the best example, and to some extent, that's true.

404
00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:15.704
But it's kinda like taking a snapshot of,

405
00:18:15.704 --> 00:18:17.068
where would you like-

406
00:18:17.068 --> 00:18:19.320
<v Regina>Your history to begin.</v>

407
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.808
<v ->It's like what image of America do you wanna have?</v>

408
00:18:21.808 --> 00:18:23.953
Do you wanna have it L.A., California,

409
00:18:23.953 --> 00:18:26.109
New York or somewhere else,

410
00:18:26.109 --> 00:18:29.431
like the heartland of Kentucky so to speak.

411
00:18:29.431 --> 00:18:32.393
And the same thing is with this Greece idea.

412
00:18:32.393 --> 00:18:35.007
Which bit of Greece do you like?

413
00:18:35.007 --> 00:18:38.176
And we tend to focus on Plato on Aristotle,

414
00:18:38.176 --> 00:18:39.872
and it's also where Erich and the book

415
00:18:39.872 --> 00:18:42.694
goes into the idea of Atlantis,

416
00:18:42.694 --> 00:18:44.875
because with Atlantis, you really have

417
00:18:44.875 --> 00:18:47.531
this idea in all of its force.

418
00:18:47.531 --> 00:18:51.073
You have a Greek guy who goes to Egypt

419
00:18:51.073 --> 00:18:52.800
and is basically told, once again,

420
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.384
that they are young, that they are a species in amnesia,

421
00:18:56.384 --> 00:18:58.242
and this is what happened before.

422
00:18:58.242 --> 00:19:00.001
And he's basically saying that there was once

423
00:19:00.001 --> 00:19:02.573
a giant civilization called Atlantis,

424
00:19:02.573 --> 00:19:04.531
which had something to do with Greece,

425
00:19:04.531 --> 00:19:06.659
and that the Greeks have forgotten about this

426
00:19:06.659 --> 00:19:09.937
and specifically, that this prehistory of Greece

427
00:19:09.937 --> 00:19:14.201
is specifically linked with the civilization of Atlantis.

428
00:19:14.201 --> 00:19:16.847
So what happens is Solon,

429
00:19:16.847 --> 00:19:20.333
the Greek dude who goes to Egypt and comes back,

430
00:19:20.333 --> 00:19:24.184
speaks to this mythical civilization,

431
00:19:24.184 --> 00:19:27.597
to his people and they don't believe him.

432
00:19:27.597 --> 00:19:30.916
When Plato writes it down, they don't believe him.

433
00:19:30.916 --> 00:19:31.953
Now the interesting thing is,

434
00:19:31.953 --> 00:19:34.530
and this is where science goes on a different path

435
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:36.788
than kinda like what the ancient Greeks did,

436
00:19:36.788 --> 00:19:39.309
because what the ancient Greeks do

437
00:19:39.309 --> 00:19:41.220
is they don't believe him.

438
00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.214
Some of them go to Egypt and what happens is,

439
00:19:44.214 --> 00:19:47.597
they speak to the same priest who Solon has spoken to,

440
00:19:47.597 --> 00:19:49.474
and they basically say,

441
00:19:49.474 --> 00:19:51.881
"Yeah, we remember this dude coming here.

442
00:19:51.881 --> 00:19:54.998
"That's the kind of wall where we basically

443
00:19:54.998 --> 00:19:58.622
"translated what was there for his purposes.

444
00:19:58.622 --> 00:20:00.003
"You can go ahead and read it yourself

445
00:20:00.003 --> 00:20:01.483
if you can read hieroglyphs,

446
00:20:01.483 --> 00:20:05.083
"and you will find out basically what we told him."

447
00:20:05.083 --> 00:20:07.588
So they jump on the boat back to Greece,

448
00:20:07.588 --> 00:20:09.948
and have to admit that they were wrong,

449
00:20:09.948 --> 00:20:11.121
that Solon was right,

450
00:20:11.121 --> 00:20:13.363
and that Plato while writing about Atlantis,

451
00:20:13.363 --> 00:20:15.622
was indeed relating factual information,

452
00:20:15.622 --> 00:20:17.884
i.e. the Egyptians had this tradition

453
00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:20.988
about a lost civilization of Atlantis.

454
00:20:20.988 --> 00:20:24.761
Now, that is the bit where Western scientists

455
00:20:24.761 --> 00:20:26.589
are uncomfortable with,

456
00:20:26.589 --> 00:20:29.393
or are not asked to elaborate on.

457
00:20:29.393 --> 00:20:31.603
Instead, what they're saying is this.

458
00:20:31.603 --> 00:20:35.186
They say Plato was a guy who was very principled,

459
00:20:35.186 --> 00:20:37.332
and so what he's doing is he's writing

460
00:20:37.332 --> 00:20:40.585
about this idealized society called Atlantis.

461
00:20:40.585 --> 00:20:42.358
Even though Plato himself says

462
00:20:42.358 --> 00:20:44.411
this is fact, this is history,

463
00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:46.302
and he writes it in a book about history.

464
00:20:46.302 --> 00:20:48.064
He's not writing it in a book about philosophy,

465
00:20:48.064 --> 00:20:50.171
he's writing it in a book about history.

466
00:20:50.171 --> 00:20:52.862
So, there is these really two worlds so to speak,

467
00:20:52.862 --> 00:20:54.692
the world of the ancient Greeks,

468
00:20:54.692 --> 00:20:57.448
which is quite clear that this was history.

469
00:20:57.448 --> 00:21:00.620
That they went, that they were skeptical about it,

470
00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.187
that they went to Egypt and came back with the facts,

471
00:21:03.187 --> 00:21:05.616
which there is this tradition about Atlantis.

472
00:21:05.616 --> 00:21:07.603
And then our Western interpretation of this,

473
00:21:07.603 --> 00:21:10.483
which is kind of like saying, "It's a morality thing.

474
00:21:10.483 --> 00:21:13.507
"It's nothing really to do with history."

475
00:21:13.507 --> 00:21:16.595
We, and I say we as a civilization,

476
00:21:16.595 --> 00:21:21.058
we as specifically the scientific establishment,

477
00:21:21.058 --> 00:21:23.601
gets away with this because the other aspect

478
00:21:23.601 --> 00:21:26.973
really is less heard of, it is really confined

479
00:21:26.973 --> 00:21:30.659
to the books of Erich, to material which,

480
00:21:30.659 --> 00:21:33.362
so far, hasn't really gotten an airing

481
00:21:33.362 --> 00:21:35.977
on the same par as scientists.

482
00:21:35.977 --> 00:21:37.961
When you look at the big Hollywood productions,

483
00:21:37.961 --> 00:21:40.732
when it comes to Atlantis, so far there has always been

484
00:21:40.732 --> 00:21:44.980
this Side A, Side B, and Side B, which is the skeptics,

485
00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.841
have always been away with this idea

486
00:21:48.841 --> 00:21:50.334
that it is all morality and they have

487
00:21:50.334 --> 00:21:53.217
quite often been given the last word.

488
00:21:53.217 --> 00:21:54.803
To a large extent, that is changing,

489
00:21:54.803 --> 00:21:57.993
I mean, Ancient Aliens is a primary example of that,

490
00:21:57.993 --> 00:22:00.800
whereby really what the producers are trying to do

491
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.343
is set out a course and say, "This is what we think it is,

492
00:22:04.343 --> 00:22:06.277
"and now it is over to you, to the audience

493
00:22:06.277 --> 00:22:07.821
"to decide whether this is convincing."

494
00:22:07.821 --> 00:22:08.962
<v Regina>Yes, and I really appreciate</v>

495
00:22:08.962 --> 00:22:10.339
the producers for doing that, because really,

496
00:22:10.339 --> 00:22:11.747
it's the first time on these subjects

497
00:22:11.747 --> 00:22:13.328
they've been given a true voice.

498
00:22:13.328 --> 00:22:16.324
<v ->Yes, and you know, because to some extent</v>

499
00:22:16.324 --> 00:22:19.187
Atlantis has nothing to do with ancient aliens,

500
00:22:19.187 --> 00:22:22.076
so far, the topic of Atlantis has never been given

501
00:22:22.076 --> 00:22:23.349
this side A treatment.

502
00:22:23.349 --> 00:22:25.219
<v Regina>Why do you think it is Atlantis,</v>

503
00:22:25.219 --> 00:22:26.581
you just explained a good amount of it,

504
00:22:26.581 --> 00:22:28.356
but do you think there's anything beyond that,

505
00:22:28.356 --> 00:22:31.300
something larger that is creating this...

506
00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.626
skepticism, almost denial that a place

507
00:22:34.626 --> 00:22:36.471
such as Atlantis could have existed?

508
00:22:36.471 --> 00:22:39.212
What's the fear around Atlantis in all your studies?

509
00:22:39.212 --> 00:22:41.257
<v ->I think it's a general fear.</v>

510
00:22:41.257 --> 00:22:45.144
I think it's a general fear that we don't want to accept

511
00:22:45.144 --> 00:22:47.746
that large bits of our history are unknown,

512
00:22:47.746 --> 00:22:50.550
or are different than what we think it is.

513
00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.421
It's very much, there's this beautiful scene,

514
00:22:53.421 --> 00:22:55.237
probably in the book as well, but definitely in the movie

515
00:22:55.237 --> 00:22:58.169
of The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco,

516
00:22:58.169 --> 00:23:01.978
in which the church is confronted with new documents

517
00:23:01.978 --> 00:23:04.003
which are hidden in this big tower.

518
00:23:04.003 --> 00:23:06.132
And the church basically says,

519
00:23:06.132 --> 00:23:08.719
"Well, everything about religion,

520
00:23:08.719 --> 00:23:10.683
"everything there is to know, we already know.

521
00:23:10.683 --> 00:23:13.175
"And anything else which we find

522
00:23:13.175 --> 00:23:14.661
"is just going to be confirmation

523
00:23:14.661 --> 00:23:16.272
"of what we already know."

524
00:23:16.272 --> 00:23:19.005
And to a large extent, that's where science is as well,

525
00:23:19.005 --> 00:23:21.584
specifically when it comes to history and archaeology.

526
00:23:21.584 --> 00:23:22.941
We know everything.

527
00:23:22.941 --> 00:23:24.242
<v Regina>That's a very arrogant position</v>

528
00:23:24.242 --> 00:23:26.890
for both religion and science to take,

529
00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:29.006
as though the last word has already been said.

530
00:23:29.006 --> 00:23:33.097
<v ->Yes, but unfortunately, it is that position they are in.</v>

531
00:23:33.097 --> 00:23:36.724
Everything which is new,

532
00:23:36.724 --> 00:23:38.584
as much as it is hyped,

533
00:23:38.584 --> 00:23:42.330
like a new discovery of this, new this, new that.

534
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:43.741
They are never really challenging,

535
00:23:43.741 --> 00:23:45.139
they are never really kind of saying,

536
00:23:45.139 --> 00:23:46.708
"Oh my God, look what we just found.

537
00:23:46.708 --> 00:23:49.929
"It is completely shattering our idea about this."

538
00:23:49.929 --> 00:23:52.895
It's a headline which makes great word about how they say,

539
00:23:52.895 --> 00:23:54.760
but it is something along the lines of,

540
00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:58.502
you know, "We though the pins on the hat of whatever

541
00:23:58.502 --> 00:24:02.586
"dated back to 1650, Oh my God, it was 1600!"

542
00:24:02.586 --> 00:24:06.634
It is this slight, almost kinda like you know,

543
00:24:06.634 --> 00:24:09.188
OK, no it's slightly different.

544
00:24:09.188 --> 00:24:10.773
A very good example of this

545
00:24:10.773 --> 00:24:12.255
is actually the dating of the Great Pyramid.

546
00:24:13.835 --> 00:24:16.786
Since the 1980s, there have been carbon dating results

547
00:24:16.786 --> 00:24:21.409
which show that the pyramid is 500 years older than it is.

548
00:24:21.409 --> 00:24:26.253
This is not contested, but if it was to be accepted,

549
00:24:26.253 --> 00:24:29.592
if it was to become part of the Egyptological framework,

550
00:24:29.592 --> 00:24:31.310
what would happen is basically

551
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:33.770
that the entire timeline has to be revisited,

552
00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.857
because for 150 years,

553
00:24:36.857 --> 00:24:38.975
this timeline has been set in stone.

554
00:24:38.975 --> 00:24:41.729
And what we're doing now, really we have to

555
00:24:41.729 --> 00:24:43.855
make allowances for the carbon dating,

556
00:24:43.855 --> 00:24:45.450
is move it slightly here.

557
00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:49.034
OK, a few years here, a few years there, a few years there.

558
00:24:49.034 --> 00:24:52.096
But, Egyptologists aren't able to do this.

559
00:24:52.096 --> 00:24:55.253
They realize that the entire house of cards will fall apart

560
00:24:55.253 --> 00:24:59.232
because it's like saying it's so close,

561
00:24:59.232 --> 00:25:00.533
there is no room for breathing.

562
00:25:00.533 --> 00:25:04.946
Either it's completely wrong or completely, oh, right!

563
00:25:04.946 --> 00:25:08.698
And they have assumed so far that it is completely right,

564
00:25:08.698 --> 00:25:12.754
and now 500 years, small as it may seem,

565
00:25:12.754 --> 00:25:15.302
it makes it appear as if it's completely wrong.

566
00:25:15.302 --> 00:25:18.080
And so what happens is, for 30 years,

567
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.388
they have refused to publish the carbon dating results

568
00:25:21.388 --> 00:25:22.443
which show that the pyramid

569
00:25:22.443 --> 00:25:25.360
is 500 years older for two reasons.

570
00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.501
One, it also shows that the pyramid

571
00:25:27.501 --> 00:25:30.737
right next to it is built before rather than,

572
00:25:30.737 --> 00:25:32.742
so the sequence would have to be reversed.

573
00:25:32.742 --> 00:25:35.216
But specifically, they play this game

574
00:25:35.216 --> 00:25:37.098
that because it's not been published

575
00:25:37.098 --> 00:25:39.789
in any scientific journal that it doesn't exist.

576
00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:41.830
So we can just pretend as if it's not there.

577
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:44.324
And it's the game they play time and time again.

578
00:25:44.324 --> 00:25:47.995
And it's a game they play well, because they have

579
00:25:47.995 --> 00:25:50.215
decided that there are certain rules

580
00:25:50.215 --> 00:25:52.338
with which the scientific game can be played,

581
00:25:52.338 --> 00:25:54.460
and the scientific game is played with the fact

582
00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.564
as to whether or not something has been published

583
00:25:57.564 --> 00:26:00.537
in a scientific publication.

584
00:26:00.537 --> 00:26:04.664
To a large extent, this is what happens in Egyptology,

585
00:26:04.664 --> 00:26:08.737
and it is also reason why the entire prehistory

586
00:26:08.737 --> 00:26:13.522
of ancient Greece is banned,

587
00:26:13.522 --> 00:26:15.623
because it touches upon things

588
00:26:15.623 --> 00:26:17.602
which they don't even want to go into.

589
00:26:17.602 --> 00:26:19.581
There is so much more material there

590
00:26:19.581 --> 00:26:21.757
than actually Odyssey of the Gods.

591
00:26:21.757 --> 00:26:25.348
There has been extraordinary amounts of information

592
00:26:25.348 --> 00:26:27.180
as to how, when you start looking into

593
00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:28.682
The Odyssey and The Iliad,

594
00:26:28.682 --> 00:26:30.897
there are like several layers there.

595
00:26:30.897 --> 00:26:33.256
One of the layers is an astronomical layer,

596
00:26:33.256 --> 00:26:35.787
and when you start peeling that layer off,

597
00:26:35.787 --> 00:26:37.825
or like extrapolating that layer,

598
00:26:37.825 --> 00:26:39.841
what you have is extraordinary information

599
00:26:39.841 --> 00:26:41.259
that the ancient Greeks were aware

600
00:26:41.259 --> 00:26:45.069
of the procession, that they even were

601
00:26:45.069 --> 00:26:48.382
placing certain cities in correspondence

602
00:26:48.382 --> 00:26:50.472
with certain constellations.

603
00:26:50.472 --> 00:26:53.282
And all of that, as clear

604
00:26:53.282 --> 00:26:56.232
and as precise as that information is,

605
00:26:56.232 --> 00:26:57.907
is basically something which the people

606
00:26:57.907 --> 00:27:00.445
who are discovering these things,

607
00:27:00.445 --> 00:27:02.545
they are published by popular books,

608
00:27:02.545 --> 00:27:05.362
by popular publishers, because they can't get

609
00:27:05.362 --> 00:27:09.224
that kind of information into the scientific framework,

610
00:27:09.224 --> 00:27:10.502
because guess what?

611
00:27:10.502 --> 00:27:13.811
The academics have decided

612
00:27:13.811 --> 00:27:16.761
that the procession,

613
00:27:16.761 --> 00:27:18.816
that all of this astronomical information

614
00:27:18.816 --> 00:27:21.959
is not something which our ancestors knew.

615
00:27:21.959 --> 00:27:24.875
That this is far later, that the Greeks

616
00:27:24.875 --> 00:27:27.104
only came upon this in the last few centuries

617
00:27:27.104 --> 00:27:30.372
of their civilization rather than that ancestors

618
00:27:30.372 --> 00:27:31.525
would already have been aware of it.

619
00:27:31.525 --> 00:27:32.609
<v Regina>But it's so well-established</v>

620
00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:33.809
throughout Arabic history,

621
00:27:33.809 --> 00:27:36.184
Indian history, Egyptian history.

622
00:27:36.184 --> 00:27:38.795
Those disciplines have been around

623
00:27:38.795 --> 00:27:40.542
for thousands upon thousands of years.

624
00:27:40.542 --> 00:27:42.837
Why would they say the Greeks didn't have access to it?

625
00:27:42.837 --> 00:27:46.018
<v ->The ostrich is a very funny instrument</v>

626
00:27:46.018 --> 00:27:47.656
for when it comes to scientists.

627
00:27:47.656 --> 00:27:51.116
<v Regina>It really is, it's almost this denial</v>

628
00:27:51.116 --> 00:27:54.378
and refusal to look at evidence that's placed before them

629
00:27:54.378 --> 00:27:58.034
is only really making academia pretty much...

630
00:27:59.564 --> 00:28:01.184
what is the word I'm looking for?

631
00:28:01.184 --> 00:28:02.714
No longer viable, superfluous,

632
00:28:02.714 --> 00:28:05.053
it's not really relevant anymore.

633
00:28:05.053 --> 00:28:07.571
<v ->Well, I think that is, to some extent, the case.</v>

634
00:28:07.571 --> 00:28:10.432
I think they're in a position whereby they have

635
00:28:10.432 --> 00:28:13.665
really pushed it to a point in time

636
00:28:13.665 --> 00:28:15.772
where people are beginning to realize

637
00:28:15.772 --> 00:28:17.025
that they're constantly saying,

638
00:28:17.025 --> 00:28:19.633
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."

639
00:28:19.633 --> 00:28:21.622
<v Regina>You see the pattern, anyone can see the pattern.</v>

640
00:28:21.622 --> 00:28:24.790
<v ->Yes, and to a large extent, I think they are</v>

641
00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:27.534
given free reign because there are so many other problems

642
00:28:27.534 --> 00:28:29.739
right now which the world is being faced with.

643
00:28:29.739 --> 00:28:31.216
But I think in the next few years,

644
00:28:31.216 --> 00:28:33.320
what's really going to become apparent,

645
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.033
is that they really have to become answerable.

646
00:28:36.033 --> 00:28:39.825
That they really are being told, "OK, if you wanna have

647
00:28:39.825 --> 00:28:43.349
"a million, or whatever a project is going to cost,

648
00:28:43.349 --> 00:28:46.523
" you really need to give us information,

649
00:28:46.523 --> 00:28:48.434
"you need to give us some of the answers."

650
00:28:48.434 --> 00:28:51.092
And so far, they're able

651
00:28:51.092 --> 00:28:54.200
to basically jump through the hoops,

652
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.586
which kind of like other people

653
00:28:55.586 --> 00:28:56.901
are trying to push them into,

654
00:28:56.901 --> 00:29:00.055
of saying, "OK, you really need to be accountable for this."

655
00:29:00.055 --> 00:29:01.592
This isn't science as a whole.

656
00:29:01.592 --> 00:29:03.476
There are obviously areas of science,

657
00:29:03.476 --> 00:29:06.982
when it comes to laboratory, or chemistry, or physics,

658
00:29:06.982 --> 00:29:08.149
<v Regina>They're different, yeah.</v>

659
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:09.488
<v ->where there's really kind of like, you know,</v>

660
00:29:09.488 --> 00:29:11.211
however abhorrent some of these things

661
00:29:11.211 --> 00:29:14.262
sometimes go wrong at night,

662
00:29:14.262 --> 00:29:15.898
at least there is some control.

663
00:29:15.898 --> 00:29:18.967
But pretty much when it comes to archaeology and history,

664
00:29:18.967 --> 00:29:22.370
what you find is a very liberal science of people

665
00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:25.327
who basically can choose and do what they want,

666
00:29:25.327 --> 00:29:26.939
and say, "Oh, well, we were gonna go

667
00:29:26.939 --> 00:29:29.903
"over that for next year, then we're gonna go there."

668
00:29:29.903 --> 00:29:33.422
And wherever they dig, if they do find something,

669
00:29:33.422 --> 00:29:35.586
it's sometimes takes 10, 15, 20 years

670
00:29:35.586 --> 00:29:37.398
before they write up this material.

671
00:29:37.398 --> 00:29:38.642
<v Regina>Well now going back, I mean,</v>

672
00:29:38.642 --> 00:29:40.871
who knows, it may be that it's time for a whole new genre

673
00:29:40.871 --> 00:29:43.441
of sciences to begin popping up, and they are.

674
00:29:43.441 --> 00:29:46.024
Actually, they are which is interesting in itself.

675
00:29:46.024 --> 00:29:48.558
Now, going back to that story which you talked about,

676
00:29:48.558 --> 00:29:50.513
about Solon and speaking

677
00:29:50.513 --> 00:29:54.343
about the continent of Atlantis,

678
00:29:54.343 --> 00:29:57.195
and they were very detailed in their description of it,

679
00:29:57.195 --> 00:29:58.829
which I found interesting.

680
00:29:58.829 --> 00:30:01.671
It was as though the detail was actually

681
00:30:01.671 --> 00:30:04.772
giving credibility to the notion that it did exist,

682
00:30:04.772 --> 00:30:07.596
and one of the things they were mentioning

683
00:30:07.596 --> 00:30:09.764
is that a lot of the Greek names

684
00:30:09.764 --> 00:30:14.017
were actually derived from what took place on Atlantis.

685
00:30:14.017 --> 00:30:16.444
He speaks of that, and very, very advanced

686
00:30:16.444 --> 00:30:19.644
agricultural practices, things we don't even do now

687
00:30:19.644 --> 00:30:21.821
were said to have existed at that time.

688
00:30:21.821 --> 00:30:25.079
If you care to go on a little bit more about the nature

689
00:30:25.079 --> 00:30:28.524
of what Atlantis was revealed to be by Solon

690
00:30:28.524 --> 00:30:32.276
so people understand this isn't just a vague thought.

691
00:30:32.276 --> 00:30:36.463
<v ->Well, as you say, there are details about Atlantis</v>

692
00:30:36.463 --> 00:30:38.781
which really make it clear that the information

693
00:30:38.781 --> 00:30:41.154
which Solon and Plato were writing about,

694
00:30:41.154 --> 00:30:43.859
really has very little to do with morality.

695
00:30:43.859 --> 00:30:46.953
The dimensions of Atlantis, how there are,

696
00:30:46.953 --> 00:30:48.599
what the walls are built with,

697
00:30:48.599 --> 00:30:51.483
how deep or wide the canals are.

698
00:30:51.483 --> 00:30:53.600
There's little morality to it.

699
00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.117
It is straightforward information which kinda goes like

700
00:30:56.117 --> 00:30:57.899
OK, here it is, what we know about it.

701
00:30:57.899 --> 00:30:59.822
This is what the Egyptians told us,

702
00:30:59.822 --> 00:31:03.059
and here it is for our ancestors to take with it.

703
00:31:03.059 --> 00:31:06.537
Now, that is very interesting information for us,

704
00:31:06.537 --> 00:31:09.194
because those people who are inclined

705
00:31:09.194 --> 00:31:11.697
to say Atlantis is a real civilization

706
00:31:11.697 --> 00:31:14.476
are trying to pinpoint it left, right, and center.

707
00:31:14.476 --> 00:31:17.499
And so, they will come and say it's Thera,

708
00:31:17.499 --> 00:31:20.860
or it's Crete, or it is this or it is that.

709
00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.294
But what you're really confronted with

710
00:31:22.294 --> 00:31:25.281
is a land mass which is roughly the size of France,

711
00:31:25.281 --> 00:31:29.034
the width of France, where you have to find a place for.

712
00:31:29.034 --> 00:31:31.645
So it's not just something which you can put anywhere,

713
00:31:31.645 --> 00:31:34.804
as historians are doing.

714
00:31:34.804 --> 00:31:38.150
The value of this is, is that we really are confronted

715
00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:40.526
not just with a lost civilization,

716
00:31:40.526 --> 00:31:43.339
which scientists might try to put on Thera,

717
00:31:43.339 --> 00:31:45.241
but really with a vast civilization

718
00:31:45.241 --> 00:31:47.521
with lots of earthworks involved.

719
00:31:47.521 --> 00:31:49.650
Canals were dug, walls were built,

720
00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:51.955
an ancient city was there.

721
00:31:51.955 --> 00:31:53.933
All of these things suggest that this was

722
00:31:53.933 --> 00:31:57.552
a civilization which lasted a few thousands of years,

723
00:31:57.552 --> 00:32:01.076
precisely what the ancient accounts are saying.

724
00:32:01.076 --> 00:32:04.557
And so, what you have is an agricultural civilization.

725
00:32:04.557 --> 00:32:08.144
You find that they have definitely an ability

726
00:32:08.144 --> 00:32:10.730
when it comes to metalworking,

727
00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:13.371
that they have an ability with seafaring,

728
00:32:13.371 --> 00:32:15.763
that they have an organized society,

729
00:32:15.763 --> 00:32:18.810
which actually seems to be following the decimal system

730
00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:21.240
in the sense that there are ten kingdoms.

731
00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:25.040
There is a line of inheritance which is interesting.

732
00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.537
The line of inheritance suggests that it is very much

733
00:32:27.537 --> 00:32:30.046
on par with ancient Egypt, and actually on par

734
00:32:30.046 --> 00:32:32.982
with some Celtic tribes of Western Europe as well.

735
00:32:32.982 --> 00:32:35.852
So all of these details really make it far more apparent

736
00:32:35.852 --> 00:32:37.689
that what we're dealing with here

737
00:32:37.689 --> 00:32:40.014
is a civilization which is real,

738
00:32:40.014 --> 00:32:41.689
and the information which we're getting,

739
00:32:41.689 --> 00:32:43.458
is of such a nature that there is

740
00:32:43.458 --> 00:32:45.742
very little room for morality in there.

741
00:32:47.342 --> 00:32:50.918
A line of inheritance is, you can say that,

742
00:32:50.918 --> 00:32:55.195
"OK, maybe we should've made more role for women,"

743
00:32:55.195 --> 00:32:58.489
and that is something which Plato is trying to say.

744
00:32:58.489 --> 00:33:00.913
But he could have said it far more directly

745
00:33:00.913 --> 00:33:05.503
than inserting little details about how Atlantis

746
00:33:05.503 --> 00:33:09.624
was somehow descended to the female lineage as well.

747
00:33:09.624 --> 00:33:11.967
In all of these things, what you're confronted with

748
00:33:11.967 --> 00:33:15.627
are historical details rather than morality details.

749
00:33:15.627 --> 00:33:17.986
And this is precisely what Erich

750
00:33:17.986 --> 00:33:20.583
is also trying to say in his book.

751
00:33:20.583 --> 00:33:23.740
The book at some point actually says

752
00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:24.951
"OK, let's not make this chapter

753
00:33:24.951 --> 00:33:27.475
"about where Atlantis precisely was.

754
00:33:27.475 --> 00:33:29.485
"Let's instead look at what Atlantis was

755
00:33:29.485 --> 00:33:31.458
"rather than where it was."

756
00:33:31.458 --> 00:33:33.134
And I think that's a good take.

757
00:33:33.134 --> 00:33:36.921
I think because it does show that

758
00:33:36.921 --> 00:33:38.321
what we're confronted with here

759
00:33:38.321 --> 00:33:40.383
once again is fact, not fiction.

760
00:33:40.383 --> 00:33:43.886
And the more you start trying to make a debate

761
00:33:43.886 --> 00:33:47.422
as to where Atlantis is, the less interest

762
00:33:47.422 --> 00:33:49.457
you can generate into what Atlantis was.

763
00:33:49.457 --> 00:33:52.105
I think that was definitely a point where Erich

764
00:33:52.105 --> 00:33:53.841
wanted to underline into saying,

765
00:33:53.841 --> 00:33:57.205
"I really wanted this to be about a lost civilization,

766
00:33:57.205 --> 00:33:59.188
"with lost technology rather than

767
00:33:59.188 --> 00:34:00.948
"the average take on Atlantis."

768
00:34:00.948 --> 00:34:02.300
<v Regina>And, even so he does bring in</v>

769
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.826
a little bit of evidence which stated that

770
00:34:04.826 --> 00:34:08.113
about 18,500 years ago, the water levels

771
00:34:08.113 --> 00:34:10.251
in the region of the Mediterranean

772
00:34:10.251 --> 00:34:12.951
were about 115 feet lower, for example.

773
00:34:12.951 --> 00:34:16.118
So, just kinda throwing in there, things do change.

774
00:34:16.118 --> 00:34:17.789
And sometimes it can something as simple

775
00:34:17.789 --> 00:34:21.990
as a shift in the levels of the water, for example.

776
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.957
You can look where you want,

777
00:34:22.957 --> 00:34:25.584
and many authors have, as you already pointed out.

778
00:34:25.584 --> 00:34:27.504
Many authors have tried to pinpoint where it is,

779
00:34:27.504 --> 00:34:30.409
but again, there's this documentation of a very,

780
00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:33.326
very specific kind of society, and then again,

781
00:34:33.326 --> 00:34:35.754
one of the things I find interesting

782
00:34:35.754 --> 00:34:38.061
about Convoluted Universe by Dolores,

783
00:34:38.061 --> 00:34:40.789
is all these different people under hypnosis

784
00:34:40.789 --> 00:34:43.118
are bringing in pixels of the same story

785
00:34:43.118 --> 00:34:46.219
about what life was like there at that time.

786
00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:47.797
And that, it's kind of interesting

787
00:34:47.797 --> 00:34:49.929
even though it's not a recognized science,

788
00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:53.108
but people wakening up within their own consciousness

789
00:34:53.108 --> 00:34:55.428
and having information come to the fore,

790
00:34:55.428 --> 00:34:58.087
be it through hypnosis or whatnot,

791
00:34:58.087 --> 00:35:01.426
dreamtime, is really starting to piece

792
00:35:01.426 --> 00:35:03.868
the picture together more solidly.

793
00:35:03.868 --> 00:35:06.560
How do you feel, and how does Erich feel

794
00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.278
about this kind of personal conscious

795
00:35:09.278 --> 00:35:11.657
type of evidence coming forward?

796
00:35:11.657 --> 00:35:14.579
<v ->Well, Erich is very much a man of his time,</v>

797
00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:17.035
and he has a very specific mission,

798
00:35:17.035 --> 00:35:19.583
which is to really tell the world that history is wrong.

799
00:35:19.583 --> 00:35:21.733
I mean, it's a title of one of his books,

800
00:35:21.733 --> 00:35:25.161
and it's something which he really wants to bring out there.

801
00:35:25.161 --> 00:35:27.352
Erich is also a man who really writes

802
00:35:27.352 --> 00:35:29.855
to the billions of people,

803
00:35:29.855 --> 00:35:32.385
your average Joe in the street,

804
00:35:32.385 --> 00:35:34.333
and to which he wants to say,

805
00:35:34.333 --> 00:35:36.190
you know,"OK, wake up."

806
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:39.550
But his waking up is very much of what I would call

807
00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:42.030
a fundamental waking up, of saying,

808
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:44.434
reality, our history is wrong,

809
00:35:44.434 --> 00:35:46.804
and we really should start looking into that.

810
00:35:46.804 --> 00:35:50.110
So the consciousness aspect of it

811
00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:52.771
is something which he's interested in,

812
00:35:52.771 --> 00:35:56.565
but it's not part of what I would call his core mission.

813
00:35:56.565 --> 00:35:59.573
If people walk away a better human being,

814
00:35:59.573 --> 00:36:03.187
and if people realize that there is such a thing as mind,

815
00:36:03.187 --> 00:36:05.824
and that our ancestors were far more spiritual

816
00:36:05.824 --> 00:36:08.224
than we think they are, that is great.

817
00:36:08.224 --> 00:36:10.712
But it's not his core mission.

818
00:36:10.712 --> 00:36:14.326
In my case, I'm obviously of the next generation.

819
00:36:15.466 --> 00:36:18.134
My dad and Erich have roughly the same age,

820
00:36:18.134 --> 00:36:21.877
and to a large extent, I am part

821
00:36:21.877 --> 00:36:23.872
of that consciousness mission.

822
00:36:23.872 --> 00:36:27.928
I do think that it becomes apparent

823
00:36:27.928 --> 00:36:30.456
that our ancestors were saying an awful lot

824
00:36:30.456 --> 00:36:33.433
of these things through a spiritual context,

825
00:36:33.433 --> 00:36:37.107
through a consciousness network almost, so to speak.

826
00:36:37.107 --> 00:36:39.968
And one of the things I think which we also have to realize

827
00:36:39.968 --> 00:36:43.894
is that the ancient Greeks of 500 B.C.,

828
00:36:43.894 --> 00:36:46.153
even though science is claiming them as us,

829
00:36:46.153 --> 00:36:48.128
even though they are saying they're exactly like us,

830
00:36:48.128 --> 00:36:49.584
that's not the case.

831
00:36:50.634 --> 00:36:52.429
What people don't seem

832
00:36:52.429 --> 00:36:56.199
to realize too prominently

833
00:36:56.199 --> 00:36:59.248
is the fact that in roughly 150 B.C.,

834
00:36:59.248 --> 00:37:00.785
when there is this transition

835
00:37:00.785 --> 00:37:02.407
from ancient Greece to Rome,

836
00:37:02.407 --> 00:37:04.529
and transitions within Rome as well,

837
00:37:04.529 --> 00:37:07.984
that they emperor basically said that all the oracles,

838
00:37:07.984 --> 00:37:12.482
everything to do with directly experiencing spirituality

839
00:37:12.482 --> 00:37:14.458
was shut down.

840
00:37:14.458 --> 00:37:15.764
Specifically, this is important,

841
00:37:15.764 --> 00:37:18.068
because all of these oracles, even some of them

842
00:37:18.068 --> 00:37:21.172
in ancient Italy, in ancient Rome itself,

843
00:37:21.172 --> 00:37:23.837
were operated by the Greeks.

844
00:37:23.837 --> 00:37:26.207
So things like Baia, which is a very famous oracle

845
00:37:26.207 --> 00:37:27.764
which Robert Temple-
<v Regina>Which one?</v>

846
00:37:27.764 --> 00:37:31.081
<v Philip>Baia, which is around Naples.</v>

847
00:37:31.081 --> 00:37:33.674
Robert Temple has written a book about it,

848
00:37:33.674 --> 00:37:36.163
and has made a TV documentary about it.

849
00:37:36.163 --> 00:37:39.377
It's just one example of how throughout the Roman Empire,

850
00:37:39.377 --> 00:37:42.798
all of these sites were closed off.

851
00:37:42.798 --> 00:37:46.804
Some of them were kept open secretly

852
00:37:46.804 --> 00:37:49.784
by people, by locals who continued to do so.

853
00:37:49.784 --> 00:37:51.660
But in the case of Baia, what you actually had

854
00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.947
is that thousands of tons of sand and stones

855
00:37:54.947 --> 00:37:57.209
and whatever they could find

856
00:37:57.209 --> 00:37:59.774
were pushed into the subterranean corridors

857
00:37:59.774 --> 00:38:02.229
because they didn't want this to continue.

858
00:38:02.229 --> 00:38:04.838
And this to continue was precisely people

859
00:38:04.838 --> 00:38:08.542
having direct experiences of spirituality.

860
00:38:08.542 --> 00:38:12.369
That is something which we tend to forget.

861
00:38:12.369 --> 00:38:14.300
The ancient Greeks had this,

862
00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.398
the ancient Greeks speak of the oracles.

863
00:38:16.398 --> 00:38:21.171
Delphi is notorious for its direct experience of the Pythia,

864
00:38:21.171 --> 00:38:24.764
who is your go-between to the world of the gods.

865
00:38:24.764 --> 00:38:28.178
This world of the gods is to some extent,

866
00:38:28.178 --> 00:38:29.772
a different god that the god

867
00:38:29.772 --> 00:38:32.002
who was physically present here.

868
00:38:33.232 --> 00:38:35.729
In my book, I make this distinction as well.

869
00:38:35.729 --> 00:38:39.249
I say that there is a non-human intelligence out there,

870
00:38:39.249 --> 00:38:42.593
which we can contact on a metaphysical level,

871
00:38:42.593 --> 00:38:44.017
but even though that some of them

872
00:38:44.017 --> 00:38:46.076
have been physically present here.

873
00:38:46.076 --> 00:38:47.718
And I think it's an end universe,

874
00:38:47.718 --> 00:38:51.219
and I think, for my generation, or specifically,

875
00:38:51.219 --> 00:38:54.790
my mission, that it is to be made clear

876
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:58.313
that ET just wasn't here in a physical form,

877
00:38:58.313 --> 00:39:02.750
that ET can be here and was here in a non-physical form,

878
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:05.162
and that, to some extent, the ancient Greeks

879
00:39:05.162 --> 00:39:07.650
who even though they were talking about

880
00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:12.069
physical beings and physical interactions with deities,

881
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:15.350
that there was also a spiritual aspect to their dimension.

882
00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:18.714
And so once again, whereas you might get the impression

883
00:39:18.714 --> 00:39:22.557
that what Erich is doing is that everything turning into ET,

884
00:39:22.557 --> 00:39:25.073
basically what Erich is doing is he's only

885
00:39:25.073 --> 00:39:28.265
turning those things into ET which he's writing about.

886
00:39:28.265 --> 00:39:29.710
Certain things are off-topic,

887
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:32.002
or he doesn't discuss certain things,

888
00:39:32.002 --> 00:39:34.607
because to a large extent, they are not part

889
00:39:34.607 --> 00:39:37.274
of what he's trying to explain.

890
00:39:37.274 --> 00:39:40.826
Simply because he doesn't talk about them,

891
00:39:40.826 --> 00:39:42.640
it doesn't mean that Erich is saying,

892
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.365
"Well, everything is ET."

893
00:39:44.365 --> 00:39:45.851
The things he writes about are ET,

894
00:39:45.851 --> 00:39:49.823
the other ones are basically things he doesn't write about,

895
00:39:49.823 --> 00:39:53.324
because a book is limited to a certain amount of pages.

896
00:39:53.324 --> 00:39:57.775
And so, he is specifically focusing on that,

897
00:39:57.775 --> 00:40:00.411
he is specifically focusing on physical contact,

898
00:40:00.411 --> 00:40:04.369
physical legacy of ET contact, but I think definitely

899
00:40:04.369 --> 00:40:08.049
my part of this story, as I say in my book as well,

900
00:40:08.049 --> 00:40:09.532
is to also show that there is

901
00:40:09.532 --> 00:40:11.131
a consciousness aspect to this.

902
00:40:11.131 --> 00:40:13.488
I think when you start comparing the two,

903
00:40:13.488 --> 00:40:15.197
or putting the two together,

904
00:40:15.197 --> 00:40:16.850
that's when you're beginning to realize

905
00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:20.088
what ancient Greece really was all about.

906
00:40:20.088 --> 00:40:22.038
The overall principle of ancient Greece,

907
00:40:22.038 --> 00:40:23.519
as so many other civilizations,

908
00:40:23.519 --> 00:40:27.039
is basically the fact that reality was far more complex

909
00:40:27.039 --> 00:40:29.376
than we give it credence today.

910
00:40:29.376 --> 00:40:32.818
<v Regina>And far more sophisticated, even technologically.</v>

911
00:40:32.818 --> 00:40:34.859
There's a reference, in fact, let me pick this book up,

912
00:40:34.859 --> 00:40:38.329
because I read this before,

913
00:40:38.329 --> 00:40:42.916
and this is talking about the destruction of the society.

914
00:40:42.916 --> 00:40:45.211
OK, which page is that?

915
00:40:47.001 --> 00:40:49.866
Oh here it is, right here.

916
00:40:49.866 --> 00:40:53.396
From the Mahabharata, it says...

917
00:40:56.266 --> 00:41:00.337
essentially, that they're talking about weaponry of the time

918
00:41:00.343 --> 00:41:03.491
And again, the reason I think this is also relevant

919
00:41:03.491 --> 00:41:04.769
is because we've entered a time

920
00:41:04.769 --> 00:41:07.628
where the same technologies more or less exist today.

921
00:41:07.628 --> 00:41:10.743
Similar, even if they're maybe not quite as sophisticated.

922
00:41:10.743 --> 00:41:13.922
These highly destructive technologies exist today,

923
00:41:13.922 --> 00:41:17.166
and by being able to bring back the historical milieu

924
00:41:17.166 --> 00:41:18.576
of what happened and what occurred

925
00:41:18.576 --> 00:41:21.554
around the destruction of these great civilizations,

926
00:41:21.554 --> 00:41:23.494
these serve as really wonderful sign posts

927
00:41:23.494 --> 00:41:24.947
for where we are right now.

928
00:41:24.947 --> 00:41:26.351
This is what it was saying,

929
00:41:26.351 --> 00:41:28.360
"The unknown weapon is radiant lightning,

930
00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.017
"a frightful messenger of death,

931
00:41:30.017 --> 00:41:32.602
"which turns to ashes all who belong

932
00:41:32.602 --> 00:41:35.203
"to the Vrishni and the Andhaka.

933
00:41:35.203 --> 00:41:37.674
"The bodies consumed by fire were unrecognizable.

934
00:41:37.674 --> 00:41:39.186
"Those who escaped with their lives

935
00:41:39.186 --> 00:41:41.045
"lost their hair and their nails.

936
00:41:41.045 --> 00:41:42.668
"Clay pots broke without cause.

937
00:41:42.668 --> 00:41:44.059
"The burns turned white.

938
00:41:44.059 --> 00:41:46.450
"In a short while, food became poisonous.

939
00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:48.993
"The lightning fell to Earth and became fine dust."

940
00:41:48.993 --> 00:41:51.976
Well, sounds like a nuclear explosion, and in fact,

941
00:41:51.976 --> 00:41:54.098
I've done a little bit of journeying myself

942
00:41:54.098 --> 00:41:56.342
over the last 30 years, a lot of it actually.

943
00:41:56.342 --> 00:41:59.871
And ended up in this exact situation, watching this occur,

944
00:41:59.871 --> 00:42:03.248
and many thousands of people now that are waking up

945
00:42:03.248 --> 00:42:04.637
have seen the same thing.

946
00:42:04.637 --> 00:42:06.398
So, how do you fold this in,

947
00:42:06.398 --> 00:42:08.137
in terms of our need to know?

948
00:42:09.177 --> 00:42:13.354
<v ->Well, in that case, The Mahabarata is very interesting,</v>

949
00:42:13.354 --> 00:42:16.201
because, I tackled it in my book.

950
00:42:16.201 --> 00:42:19.951
It's like you have this layering, you have this,

951
00:42:19.951 --> 00:42:22.101
some people say, "OK, some of these interpretations,

952
00:42:22.101 --> 00:42:24.819
"some of these Manith manuals which exist,

953
00:42:24.819 --> 00:42:26.995
"written at the end of the 19th century.

954
00:42:26.995 --> 00:42:29.515
"They're not as old as we think they are."

955
00:42:29.515 --> 00:42:31.637
Well, something written down

956
00:42:31.637 --> 00:42:33.674
doesn't necessarily mean it was invented.

957
00:42:33.674 --> 00:42:37.115
It just means the time in which something was written down.

958
00:42:37.115 --> 00:42:39.930
Also, the end of the 19th century, remember,

959
00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:43.918
the Wright Brothers still hadn't taken to the skies,

960
00:42:43.918 --> 00:42:45.857
and things like nuclear explosions

961
00:42:45.857 --> 00:42:47.297
or even jet propulsion-

962
00:42:47.297 --> 00:42:48.536
<v Regina>Had't been conceived of yet.</v>

963
00:42:48.536 --> 00:42:49.923
<v Philip>Didn't really exist,</v>

964
00:42:49.923 --> 00:42:54.183
so it's still that old error I would say,

965
00:42:54.183 --> 00:42:58.750
pre-going, doing things which are extraordinary.

966
00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:01.039
So, what we have in the Mahabharata

967
00:43:01.039 --> 00:43:03.514
is this description very much I think,

968
00:43:03.514 --> 00:43:05.890
and this is why it ends up in the book,

969
00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:07.652
of a people who are being told

970
00:43:07.652 --> 00:43:09.864
that there was a time before them.

971
00:43:09.864 --> 00:43:13.006
When the gods were doing things in the sky, on Earth,

972
00:43:13.006 --> 00:43:16.099
and to a large extent, our ancestors were there,

973
00:43:16.099 --> 00:43:20.262
but they were kinda going, "OK, what is all of this?"

974
00:43:20.262 --> 00:43:22.211
And so, we described certain things,

975
00:43:22.211 --> 00:43:24.377
we have memories of certain things.

976
00:43:24.377 --> 00:43:25.774
Now in the case of India,

977
00:43:25.774 --> 00:43:27.971
there is one specific point of interest

978
00:43:27.971 --> 00:43:32.303
which is, and in the Ancient Alien Question I tackle this,

979
00:43:32.303 --> 00:43:35.577
whereby the question is, if these things happened,

980
00:43:35.577 --> 00:43:37.065
where is the evidence for this happening.

981
00:43:37.065 --> 00:43:40.699
Because if it is nuclear, we know that nuclear weapons

982
00:43:40.699 --> 00:43:44.967
just nuclear waste, has 26,000 lifespan,

983
00:43:44.967 --> 00:43:47.370
just to kinda, even do something with it.

984
00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:49.270
So, there should be evidence for this,

985
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:52.409
because it is roughly within that 26,000 years.

986
00:43:52.409 --> 00:43:55.056
Even if it's 100,000 years, we should still find something.

987
00:43:55.056 --> 00:43:58.596
And there is a place in Southern India

988
00:43:58.596 --> 00:44:01.448
where you really have evidence of

989
00:44:01.448 --> 00:44:03.443
increased radioactivity.

990
00:44:03.443 --> 00:44:07.466
Now, the Indian government and state governments

991
00:44:07.466 --> 00:44:09.358
have tried to explain this somewhat away.

992
00:44:09.358 --> 00:44:10.845
They have been trying to say,

993
00:44:10.845 --> 00:44:13.240
"Well, maybe it was radioactive waste

994
00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:16.102
"which was put there without proper authorization."

995
00:44:17.262 --> 00:44:20.107
The answer is, they have never been able to explain it.

996
00:44:20.107 --> 00:44:21.820
There was radioactivity there,

997
00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:24.413
nobody knows why, how it got there,

998
00:44:24.413 --> 00:44:28.923
but it is in a place linked with one of these ancient epics.

999
00:44:28.923 --> 00:44:30.720
The question then is has it been there

1000
00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.863
for thousands of years?

1001
00:44:34.103 --> 00:44:38.472
The other aspect is that the Indus Valley Civilization,

1002
00:44:38.472 --> 00:44:40.934
with places like Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa,

1003
00:44:40.934 --> 00:44:42.886
which is now in Pakistan,

1004
00:44:42.886 --> 00:44:45.619
really shows evidence of people lying in the street,

1005
00:44:45.619 --> 00:44:49.289
holding hands, a mother with her child holding hands.

1006
00:44:49.289 --> 00:44:51.639
So whatever happened there was very sudden,

1007
00:44:51.639 --> 00:44:54.217
very immediate, and science hasn't really

1008
00:44:54.217 --> 00:44:56.639
been able to explain what happened here.

1009
00:44:56.639 --> 00:45:00.152
It could have been something as simple as volcanic eruption.

1010
00:45:00.152 --> 00:45:01.654
But the answer is nobody knows,

1011
00:45:01.654 --> 00:45:03.652
nobody has been able to really date it.

1012
00:45:03.652 --> 00:45:06.212
And of course, because science "knows" that

1013
00:45:06.212 --> 00:45:09.035
there is no such thing as radioactivity in our past,

1014
00:45:09.035 --> 00:45:11.525
none of these civilizations, none of these places

1015
00:45:11.525 --> 00:45:14.816
have been checked for remains of

1016
00:45:14.816 --> 00:45:17.956
nuclear or radioactivity.

1017
00:45:17.956 --> 00:45:19.577
So, it's an open-ended question as to

1018
00:45:19.577 --> 00:45:21.271
whether or not somebody's going to find this,

1019
00:45:21.271 --> 00:45:24.768
and in the case again, of the Indus Valley Civilization,

1020
00:45:24.768 --> 00:45:27.339
what we have is the fact that this is placed

1021
00:45:27.339 --> 00:45:29.670
in Pakistan, which isn't primary grounds

1022
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:31.796
for archaeological research at the moment

1023
00:45:31.796 --> 00:45:35.316
because of all the problems there are in that region.

1024
00:45:35.316 --> 00:45:37.169
To some extent, it's almost is

1025
00:45:37.169 --> 00:45:39.101
as if science is on borrowed time.

1026
00:45:39.101 --> 00:45:40.725
They can get away with certain things

1027
00:45:40.725 --> 00:45:43.125
for a little while longer, but at some point,

1028
00:45:43.125 --> 00:45:45.991
they will have to address some of these things.

1029
00:45:45.991 --> 00:45:47.645
And then, when they have to

1030
00:45:47.645 --> 00:45:49.755
really start addressing these things,

1031
00:45:49.755 --> 00:45:53.430
it'll be very quickly become apparent I think,

1032
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:55.618
that there is validation for the fact

1033
00:45:55.618 --> 00:45:57.798
that these things have indeed happened in the past.

1034
00:45:57.798 --> 00:45:59.217
<v Regina>Then the floodgates open.</v>

1035
00:45:59.217 --> 00:46:02.375
Then all of history more or less is up for review,

1036
00:46:02.375 --> 00:46:05.392
because these anomalies occur all over the world.

1037
00:46:05.392 --> 00:46:08.799
The evidence, archaeologically, for giants

1038
00:46:08.799 --> 00:46:11.795
that have existed upon the earth, exist all over the world,

1039
00:46:11.795 --> 00:46:13.170
and sooner or later, they're going to have to explain

1040
00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:14.674
where these came from.

1041
00:46:14.674 --> 00:46:17.097
<v ->Yeah, and so far, they're getting away with it</v>

1042
00:46:17.097 --> 00:46:20.206
by having these giant skulls,

1043
00:46:20.206 --> 00:46:22.796
some of which exist in Nevada,

1044
00:46:22.796 --> 00:46:25.735
put them in small museums and then,

1045
00:46:25.735 --> 00:46:28.957
every two to three years, some of them "disappear."

1046
00:46:28.957 --> 00:46:30.899
But you know, there is a time of reckoning.

1047
00:46:30.899 --> 00:46:33.641
There is a time when people are really going to say,

1048
00:46:33.641 --> 00:46:35.293
"Well, what about this, what about that?"

1049
00:46:35.293 --> 00:46:38.159
Because the general public is becoming very informed.

1050
00:46:40.229 --> 00:46:42.338
This idea that science is going to be held accountable

1051
00:46:42.338 --> 00:46:45.776
isn't just some wish, it is really because

1052
00:46:45.776 --> 00:46:48.262
the general public is informed.

1053
00:46:48.262 --> 00:46:50.413
And to a large extent, they're becoming informed

1054
00:46:50.413 --> 00:46:52.450
because of what Erich is doing,

1055
00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:55.827
of going into certain things in extreme detail

1056
00:46:55.827 --> 00:46:59.458
in such a format that it is accessible, but also memorable.

1057
00:46:59.458 --> 00:47:01.750
Not memorable in the sense that,

1058
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:04.175
what Erich is doing is by default heroic

1059
00:47:04.175 --> 00:47:06.339
on par with the ancient Greeks themselves,

1060
00:47:06.339 --> 00:47:09.642
but memorable in the sense that people can easily remember

1061
00:47:09.642 --> 00:47:10.672
and when they're confronted

1062
00:47:10.672 --> 00:47:12.895
with statements of a different nature,

1063
00:47:12.895 --> 00:47:16.037
say, "Ehh, that's not the way it is."

1064
00:47:16.037 --> 00:47:18.020
<v Regina>Yeah, it's a very exciting time</v>

1065
00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:20.083
to be alive for that exact reason.

1066
00:47:20.083 --> 00:47:23.620
Just to kind of hop back a little bit to the gods

1067
00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:26.565
that are spoken of throughout

1068
00:47:26.565 --> 00:47:28.905
the Grecian texts.

1069
00:47:28.905 --> 00:47:30.575
Let's talk a little bit about Zeus,

1070
00:47:30.575 --> 00:47:31.898
who is the father of the gods,

1071
00:47:31.898 --> 00:47:34.598
Apollo, and then where this starts crossing over

1072
00:47:34.598 --> 00:47:37.433
where these same characters show up throughout history,

1073
00:47:37.433 --> 00:47:38.671
or are related to other

1074
00:47:38.671 --> 00:47:41.235
famous characters throughout history.

1075
00:47:41.235 --> 00:47:42.917
Can you speak to that for just a moment

1076
00:47:42.917 --> 00:47:45.569
because we start then seeing almost a lineage

1077
00:47:45.569 --> 00:47:48.534
of a certain type of being that may even have appeared

1078
00:47:48.534 --> 00:47:50.638
or reincarnated throughout history.

1079
00:47:51.568 --> 00:47:53.792
<v ->This idea of gods returning is something</v>

1080
00:47:53.792 --> 00:47:56.907
which you see time and time again.

1081
00:47:57.637 --> 00:48:00.712
You also see a template which is cross-cultural.

1082
00:48:00.712 --> 00:48:02.454
You see the civilizing deity,

1083
00:48:02.454 --> 00:48:05.088
you see the god who gives certain information.

1084
00:48:06.328 --> 00:48:08.405
Hephaestus, the god of fire,

1085
00:48:09.755 --> 00:48:13.603
the role of Ka with the ancient Egyptians.

1086
00:48:13.603 --> 00:48:14.977
You have certain things which seem

1087
00:48:14.977 --> 00:48:16.918
to have been filled in.

1088
00:48:16.918 --> 00:48:21.368
And it's a very interesting question as to what is going on.

1089
00:48:21.368 --> 00:48:22.521
Is there one central source,

1090
00:48:22.521 --> 00:48:24.921
and all these stories originate from there?

1091
00:48:24.921 --> 00:48:27.939
Or is there, to some extent, a normality to it,

1092
00:48:27.939 --> 00:48:29.840
in the sense that there will be the guy

1093
00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.240
who tells you about mathematics.

1094
00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.977
There will be the guy who tells you about astronomy.

1095
00:48:33.977 --> 00:48:36.961
And because it's a clear science,

1096
00:48:36.961 --> 00:48:39.258
they're all going to tell you the same story.

1097
00:48:40.838 --> 00:48:42.324
That is a question I think which

1098
00:48:42.324 --> 00:48:44.386
we can't answer at this moment in time.

1099
00:48:44.386 --> 00:48:47.786
This idea of reincarnation is definitely something

1100
00:48:47.786 --> 00:48:51.050
which you see specifically in religious doctrines,

1101
00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:53.889
that somehow Jesus is going to return,

1102
00:48:53.889 --> 00:48:55.392
that certain other creatures

1103
00:48:55.392 --> 00:48:56.929
are going to return in the past.

1104
00:48:58.639 --> 00:49:00.151
Obviously, the most clear example

1105
00:49:00.151 --> 00:49:02.029
of this is the Dalai Lama.

1106
00:49:02.869 --> 00:49:04.834
The Tibetan tradition basically says

1107
00:49:04.834 --> 00:49:07.576
that their leader almost upon death,

1108
00:49:07.576 --> 00:49:09.292
five minutes later is going to be reborn

1109
00:49:09.292 --> 00:49:12.176
somewhere in another body, and will be

1110
00:49:12.176 --> 00:49:14.476
once again, has to be selected and identified,

1111
00:49:14.476 --> 00:49:16.589
and taken and recognized,

1112
00:49:16.589 --> 00:49:19.226
and will become their leader by default.

1113
00:49:20.136 --> 00:49:23.662
I think with the ancient Greeks, it's different.

1114
00:49:24.532 --> 00:49:27.526
I think there is an awful lot of potential.

1115
00:49:28.636 --> 00:49:32.412
And what you see is clear in the notion

1116
00:49:32.412 --> 00:49:35.442
of this access to the underworld.

1117
00:49:35.442 --> 00:49:38.468
It is this notion that really,

1118
00:49:38.468 --> 00:49:41.303
it is up to a human being sometimes

1119
00:49:41.303 --> 00:49:43.873
to become validated,

1120
00:49:43.873 --> 00:49:46.662
to really say, "OK, you might have learned your lessons.

1121
00:49:46.662 --> 00:49:49.628
"You might have been this, you might have been that,"

1122
00:49:49.628 --> 00:49:52.323
but to some extent, that's only part of it.

1123
00:49:52.323 --> 00:49:53.296
What are you now?

1124
00:49:53.296 --> 00:49:56.180
Are you ready in this lifetime to embrace your mission?

1125
00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:58.495
And if you so are, that's great,

1126
00:49:58.495 --> 00:50:00.520
but simply because you might be

1127
00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:02.641
whoever you were in a previous life,

1128
00:50:02.641 --> 00:50:04.831
doesn't by default do this for you.

1129
00:50:05.901 --> 00:50:07.891
This is where the texts come about,

1130
00:50:07.891 --> 00:50:09.905
and sometimes, depending on where you are.

1131
00:50:09.905 --> 00:50:11.261
Sometimes it is a new soul

1132
00:50:11.261 --> 00:50:13.489
who is asked to step into old shoes,

1133
00:50:13.489 --> 00:50:15.931
or sometimes it is supposed to be

1134
00:50:15.931 --> 00:50:18.910
an old soul who's supposed to see

1135
00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:21.622
whether his old boots are still fitting him or her.

1136
00:50:21.622 --> 00:50:24.523
And, in the case of this descent into the underworld,

1137
00:50:24.523 --> 00:50:29.205
you really see that, because that is like the central part.

1138
00:50:30.765 --> 00:50:35.621
To an extent, it is the new hero to be,

1139
00:50:35.621 --> 00:50:37.077
whether a new soul or an old soul,

1140
00:50:37.077 --> 00:50:40.616
to make contact with the ancestor and to be validated,

1141
00:50:40.616 --> 00:50:42.845
and if he or she succeeds in this,

1142
00:50:42.845 --> 00:50:44.969
then you can go into the new world.

1143
00:50:44.969 --> 00:50:47.411
You can do your mission.

1144
00:50:48.251 --> 00:50:50.155
And of course, this is the primary importance

1145
00:50:50.155 --> 00:50:52.833
of the oracles, because the oracles were precisely that.

1146
00:50:52.833 --> 00:50:56.610
It was for the souls, reincarnated or otherwise,

1147
00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:59.780
to really have this A-ha moment

1148
00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:02.112
or whatever you wanna call it, this test

1149
00:51:02.112 --> 00:51:06.723
whereby years of initiation, years of preparation

1150
00:51:06.723 --> 00:51:10.392
was going to lead to a confrontation with an enabler,

1151
00:51:11.722 --> 00:51:14.680
a woman or a man or both who was going to say,

1152
00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:16.835
"OK, reality is far more complex,

1153
00:51:16.835 --> 00:51:19.716
" reality is far more this than that."

1154
00:51:19.716 --> 00:51:20.931
All of this knowledge which you

1155
00:51:20.931 --> 00:51:24.291
have taken on has just become wisdom.

1156
00:51:24.291 --> 00:51:26.179
Are you unafraid of death?

1157
00:51:26.179 --> 00:51:30.129
Are you unafraid of experiencing this initiation experience?

1158
00:51:30.129 --> 00:51:31.758
And if the answer was yes,

1159
00:51:31.758 --> 00:51:33.271
then really, you went on from there,

1160
00:51:33.271 --> 00:51:35.206
and you were recognized by society

1161
00:51:35.206 --> 00:51:37.148
as this enlightened human being

1162
00:51:37.148 --> 00:51:39.867
who spoke directly to the gods,

1163
00:51:39.867 --> 00:51:43.016
who was able to mediate between this place

1164
00:51:43.016 --> 00:51:45.800
and the former one or the one to come,

1165
00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.463
which is a different one.

1166
00:51:47.463 --> 00:51:51.408
You had been identified as this medium, literally,

1167
00:51:51.408 --> 00:51:53.699
and I guess I think this is once again,

1168
00:51:53.699 --> 00:51:55.790
the importance that, in the sense that,

1169
00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:57.253
whoever you spoke to,

1170
00:51:57.253 --> 00:52:01.729
whether it was that ET, or a live ET somewhere else,

1171
00:52:01.729 --> 00:52:05.959
it didn't really matter, you had stepped into your role.

1172
00:52:05.959 --> 00:52:08.348
I think an interesting lesson there is also

1173
00:52:08.348 --> 00:52:09.905
for the ancient Greeks, what they're saying,

1174
00:52:09.905 --> 00:52:11.809
it's not just to do with lineage.

1175
00:52:11.809 --> 00:52:13.745
It's not just to do with the fact that,

1176
00:52:13.745 --> 00:52:16.965
whatever percentage of your blood or your DNA

1177
00:52:16.965 --> 00:52:19.834
might have been related to your ancestors

1178
00:52:19.834 --> 00:52:22.086
who were ET

1179
00:52:22.086 --> 00:52:24.956
or part ET, part something else.

1180
00:52:24.956 --> 00:52:28.316
You, yourself, within, from the day you were born

1181
00:52:28.316 --> 00:52:30.289
to the moment you are there,

1182
00:52:30.289 --> 00:52:32.887
need to have the right equipment.

1183
00:52:32.887 --> 00:52:35.947
In Christian tradition, this is obviously the Grail story,

1184
00:52:35.947 --> 00:52:40.003
whereby we have Percival who is of the right blood,

1185
00:52:40.003 --> 00:52:42.147
but on a number on occasions, fails.

1186
00:52:43.077 --> 00:52:47.405
To some extent, the Grail story isn't Christian as such,

1187
00:52:47.405 --> 00:52:49.692
the Greek stories, the Greek heroes

1188
00:52:49.692 --> 00:52:51.910
who fail in their mission, or the Greek heroes

1189
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:54.190
who succeed in their mission.

1190
00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:57.495
Sometimes Greek heroes who have less blood,

1191
00:52:57.495 --> 00:53:00.071
the right blood in them, but make up with it

1192
00:53:00.071 --> 00:53:02.120
with all the right equipment in the sense that

1193
00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:06.930
they have the right metaphysical attributes.

1194
00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:09.381
This is where really the big picture

1195
00:53:09.381 --> 00:53:11.520
of Greek mythology comes about,

1196
00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:15.942
and why we think all these stories have a morality to them.

1197
00:53:15.942 --> 00:53:19.323
Morality is important, but it's just one aspect of it.

1198
00:53:19.323 --> 00:53:21.372
<v Regina>And morality aside, there is a certain type</v>

1199
00:53:21.372 --> 00:53:25.386
of innate power and fire in these beings

1200
00:53:25.386 --> 00:53:28.422
that we don't recognize in ourselves today.

1201
00:53:28.422 --> 00:53:31.133
And, as I understand it and remember it,

1202
00:53:31.133 --> 00:53:32.488
Nietzsche was the one who put forth

1203
00:53:32.488 --> 00:53:36.285
that Christianity actually had begun to make men very meek,

1204
00:53:36.285 --> 00:53:40.489
and he put forth that if men, as in I assume men and women,

1205
00:53:40.489 --> 00:53:42.585
I'm going to make that assumption,

1206
00:53:42.585 --> 00:53:45.812
could begin taking back the traits of the Greek gods,

1207
00:53:45.812 --> 00:53:50.160
we would begin finding our true potential as human beings.

1208
00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.034
<v ->What I think that is, this thing about being tested,</v>

1209
00:53:53.034 --> 00:53:56.767
this initiation thing, has slowly ebbed away.

1210
00:53:57.917 --> 00:54:00.258
When you look at Christianity as a religion,

1211
00:54:00.258 --> 00:54:03.416
it just tells you a bit of water and a bit of baptism

1212
00:54:03.416 --> 00:54:06.626
and various other things, and that's it.

1213
00:54:06.626 --> 00:54:10.089
There is no real great test for you to perform.

1214
00:54:10.089 --> 00:54:13.936
But in ancient societies, it was,

1215
00:54:13.936 --> 00:54:16.912
and the confrontation with the oracle

1216
00:54:16.912 --> 00:54:19.675
was the sum of everything.

1217
00:54:20.785 --> 00:54:24.474
Kings feared going there, kings would consult them

1218
00:54:24.474 --> 00:54:26.564
when important rules were being made,

1219
00:54:26.564 --> 00:54:30.461
and I think what is interesting about that time frame,

1220
00:54:30.461 --> 00:54:33.526
is the fact that there is this division

1221
00:54:33.526 --> 00:54:37.242
between men and women, but that, how should I put this,

1222
00:54:37.242 --> 00:54:40.496
the women helped the men into becoming man.

1223
00:54:41.506 --> 00:54:46.234
What happens in 150 B.C., when this edict comes about,

1224
00:54:46.234 --> 00:54:48.714
is that it basically says "Women, you should

1225
00:54:48.714 --> 00:54:51.229
not only be trained to help the man do this,"

1226
00:54:51.229 --> 00:54:54.831
and so, even though it has a direct effect on women,

1227
00:54:54.831 --> 00:54:58.053
it also has a direct effect on men.

1228
00:54:58.053 --> 00:55:00.870
And the end result is really that this initiation,

1229
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:03.792
this really becoming all-powerful,

1230
00:55:03.792 --> 00:55:05.650
both as a woman and as a man,

1231
00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:09.777
is denied because, pretty much after the age of 12,

1232
00:55:09.777 --> 00:55:12.873
there is nothing there for any of us to do anymore.

1233
00:55:12.873 --> 00:55:15.608
There is no stepping into your manhood so to speak,

1234
00:55:15.608 --> 00:55:17.911
or in your womanhood, and that is something

1235
00:55:17.911 --> 00:55:20.515
which was there up until that moment in time.

1236
00:55:20.515 --> 00:55:24.454
Really after 150 B.C., that begins to slowly ebb away

1237
00:55:24.454 --> 00:55:25.811
until a moment in time

1238
00:55:25.811 --> 00:55:27.487
when it really becomes institutionalized.

1239
00:55:27.487 --> 00:55:30.870
I think the reason why the role,

1240
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:33.247
the model of Mary Magdalene is so interesting

1241
00:55:33.247 --> 00:55:36.758
for so many people but specifically women today,

1242
00:55:36.758 --> 00:55:39.783
is because what you have there is a woman

1243
00:55:39.783 --> 00:55:43.416
who is very close to the 150 B.C. timeframe,

1244
00:55:43.416 --> 00:55:44.737
who to all intents and purposes,

1245
00:55:44.737 --> 00:55:47.119
was still raised within that tradition,

1246
00:55:47.119 --> 00:55:49.690
who lives within the Roman Empire,

1247
00:55:49.690 --> 00:55:51.789
but not really at the core of the Roman Empire.

1248
00:55:51.789 --> 00:55:53.667
So she gets away with certain things

1249
00:55:53.667 --> 00:55:55.840
of the old way of doing these things.

1250
00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:57.622
And you can also see that she and Jesus

1251
00:55:57.622 --> 00:56:02.161
are very much on par, and are really conforming to a model,

1252
00:56:02.161 --> 00:56:05.102
and that what you see happening is obviously that

1253
00:56:05.102 --> 00:56:07.499
as soon as Christianity becomes Roman,

1254
00:56:07.499 --> 00:56:09.153
the very first thing which happens is that

1255
00:56:09.153 --> 00:56:11.094
the Roman emperors will start

1256
00:56:11.094 --> 00:56:13.376
excising all of these things away.

1257
00:56:13.376 --> 00:56:15.137
And it is true that Mary Magdalene

1258
00:56:15.137 --> 00:56:17.797
is the first victim of this exercise,

1259
00:56:17.797 --> 00:56:20.322
because it is too apparent.

1260
00:56:20.322 --> 00:56:23.365
Obviously, Christianity can't do away with Jesus Christ.

1261
00:56:23.365 --> 00:56:25.358
So then can only do away with certain things

1262
00:56:25.358 --> 00:56:28.695
whereby Jesus Christ and the role of Mary Magdalene

1263
00:56:28.695 --> 00:56:32.199
as the initiator, they can strip away that layer.

1264
00:56:33.099 --> 00:56:34.803
But very much what you see

1265
00:56:34.803 --> 00:56:37.017
what the church is doing with Jesus,

1266
00:56:37.017 --> 00:56:40.351
it's like the fact that he goes to Britain.

1267
00:56:40.351 --> 00:56:42.847
All of these things, anything which shows you

1268
00:56:42.847 --> 00:56:45.312
that he was part and parcel of a tradition,

1269
00:56:45.312 --> 00:56:47.895
that he was being prepared to making this step,

1270
00:56:47.895 --> 00:56:50.487
of stepping into his role, and you know,

1271
00:56:50.487 --> 00:56:53.840
what has happened is that Christianity has just said,

1272
00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:55.828
"Oh, it was recognized that,

1273
00:56:55.828 --> 00:56:58.492
" John the Baptist recognized him,

1274
00:56:58.492 --> 00:57:00.288
"and John the Baptist doing this thing,

1275
00:57:00.288 --> 00:57:02.008
"is recognition of Jesus as such."

1276
00:57:02.008 --> 00:57:03.488
While you can almost see that

1277
00:57:03.488 --> 00:57:06.261
an entirely different story was happening there,

1278
00:57:06.261 --> 00:57:09.161
and that the entire story has been removed,

1279
00:57:09.161 --> 00:57:11.836
and that what we really have is this nonsensical thing

1280
00:57:11.836 --> 00:57:13.152
of a guy doing something.

1281
00:57:13.152 --> 00:57:16.061
"Oh yeah, you're the one which we're talking about."

1282
00:57:16.061 --> 00:57:17.385
It's a great honor for John the Baptist,

1283
00:57:17.385 --> 00:57:20.340
but unfortunately, it's probably very far away

1284
00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:23.338
from what really happened at that moment in time.

1285
00:57:23.338 --> 00:57:25.333
<v Regina>Exactly, so maybe Nietzsche had a point.</v>

1286
00:57:25.333 --> 00:57:29.999
Maybe we do need to go back and start embracing

1287
00:57:29.999 --> 00:57:33.302
some of the power of these original archetypes even.

1288
00:57:33.302 --> 00:57:34.797
Because we are beginning to awaken

1289
00:57:34.797 --> 00:57:36.551
to that aspect of ourselves,

1290
00:57:36.551 --> 00:57:39.286
and so, these really point the way.

1291
00:57:39.286 --> 00:57:40.984
You can say whether it's through myth,

1292
00:57:40.984 --> 00:57:44.634
or whether this is real pixels of history.

1293
00:57:45.484 --> 00:57:49.405
Maybe the time has arrived to start essentially

1294
00:57:49.405 --> 00:57:52.860
embracing that aspect of ourselves through those stories.

1295
00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:54.989
<v ->I think that's absolutely true.</v>

1296
00:57:56.279 --> 00:57:58.850
Again, we're thinking about the ancient science fiction,

1297
00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:01.467
but really the fact of the matter is,

1298
00:58:01.467 --> 00:58:04.143
that it is not science fiction.

1299
00:58:04.143 --> 00:58:06.824
But what you look at, what's coming out of Hollywood,

1300
00:58:06.824 --> 00:58:09.019
you see that there is so much material there,

1301
00:58:09.019 --> 00:58:11.511
whether it's in comic book format.

1302
00:58:11.511 --> 00:58:13.243
Whether it is just retelling

1303
00:58:13.243 --> 00:58:15.600
these ancient myths into modern clothing,

1304
00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:18.876
but there is a need for us to be confronted

1305
00:58:18.876 --> 00:58:21.811
with these ancient accounts and to do these kind of things

1306
00:58:23.505 --> 00:58:25.245
Until the moment when they once again

1307
00:58:25.245 --> 00:58:26.600
become part and parcel,

1308
00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:29.154
until the moment in time when we're beginning to

1309
00:58:29.154 --> 00:58:32.839
have the liberty to experiencing spirituality directly,

1310
00:58:32.839 --> 00:58:34.813
it'll seep through in so many ways.

1311
00:58:34.813 --> 00:58:39.202
Through X-Box or Wii gameplay, watching movies,

1312
00:58:39.202 --> 00:58:42.404
whatever it is, reading about them.

1313
00:58:42.404 --> 00:58:43.904
All of these things are really waiting

1314
00:58:43.904 --> 00:58:46.069
to enter once again into our consciousness,

1315
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:48.001
and it is very much what an archetype is.

1316
00:58:48.001 --> 00:58:51.206
It is something which is basically such a part of us,

1317
00:58:51.206 --> 00:58:54.418
which is dying to manifest itself,

1318
00:58:54.418 --> 00:58:57.625
and we either are doing this consciously,

1319
00:58:57.625 --> 00:59:00.109
or the archetype will just push itself through and say,

1320
00:59:00.109 --> 00:59:02.478
"Hey, you guys need it, here I am."

1321
00:59:03.468 --> 00:59:05.981
<v Regina>On that note, thank you very much for,</v>

1322
00:59:05.981 --> 00:59:09.052
not only serving as the surrogate and the voice for Erich,

1323
00:59:09.052 --> 00:59:12.847
but also for putting your own textures and tones into it,

1324
00:59:12.847 --> 00:59:14.169
and your information and research.

1325
00:59:14.169 --> 00:59:15.590
Thank you very much, Philip.

1326
00:59:15.590 --> 00:59:17.030
<v ->Thank you for having me.</v>

1327
00:59:19.903 --> 00:59:21.937
<v ->Again, the title of Erich von Daniken's book</v>

1328
00:59:21.937 --> 00:59:23.932
is Odyssey of the Gods, which can be found

1329
00:59:23.932 --> 00:59:25.791
at all major book sellers.

1330
00:59:25.791 --> 00:59:28.393
Meanwhile, the subject of extraterrestrial life on earth

1331
00:59:28.393 --> 00:59:30.971
has been the subject of many of our other interviews,

1332
00:59:30.971 --> 00:59:33.458
including those with Barbara Lamb, Kim Carlson,

1333
00:59:33.458 --> 00:59:35.974
James Gilliland, and Stephen Bassett.

1334
00:59:35.974 --> 00:59:38.638
Each brings a different perspective to the table.

1335
00:59:38.638 --> 00:59:41.479
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1336
00:59:41.479 --> 00:59:45.435
(mysterious and pensive synthesizer music)
