00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>>You will not find a
more engaging presentation

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.310 align:middle line:84%
on the subject of healing
and the human cell

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.200 align:middle line:90%
than what you're about to see.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Lipton's work
in cellular biology

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.000 align:middle line:84%
has rendered many
aha moments as he

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.710 align:middle line:84%
has come to understand that
our bodies and state of health

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.020 align:middle line:84%
are a direct reflection
of the harmony

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.730 align:middle line:84%
or disharmony within a
vast community of cells

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.890 align:middle line:90%
that we're made from.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.130 align:middle line:84%
In other words, a happy
community of cells

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.610 align:middle line:90%
makes a happy body.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.780 align:middle line:84%
What's more, he discovered
that cells do not

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.610 align:middle line:84%
operate as the textbooks
would teach us.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.460 align:middle line:84%
He says that we are not
just biological machines,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.570 align:middle line:84%
rather every cell in
our being communicates

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.009 align:middle line:84%
not only with each other,
but with a vast field

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.675 align:middle line:90%
of intelligence.

00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:47.160 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we pick
it up with where

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.020 align:middle line:84%
you began with
cellular biology, where

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.320 align:middle line:84%
your frustrations in
looking for answers

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.870 align:middle line:84%
occurred, and then your big
aha in 1985, 20 years ago?

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>>I started cloning stem
cells as my basic research way

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.030 align:middle line:90%
back in 1967.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.925 align:middle line:84%
So while people think
that stem cells are

00:01:06.925 --> 00:01:09.850 align:middle line:84%
a current kind of
phenomenon, I actually

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.510 align:middle line:84%
was working on
them 40 years ago.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And the significance
about the work

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.450 align:middle line:84%
on cloning these
cells was I started

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.560 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that they didn't
really necessarily correspond

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.200 align:middle line:84%
to the beliefs that I
was teaching about how

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.460 align:middle line:90%
cells worked in medical school.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.390 align:middle line:84%
So there was this
disconnect where

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.970 align:middle line:84%
I saw them behaving in
ways that were aberrant,

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.630 align:middle line:90%
or out of the ordinary.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to figure
out what was going on,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and what was the difference or
the discrepancy between what

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.130 align:middle line:84%
I expected them to be doing
and what they were doing.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And then finally got
down to an understanding

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.760 align:middle line:84%
that they were more or
less being controlled

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.140 align:middle line:84%
by the environment and
not by their genes.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting because
that actually hearkens back

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.390 align:middle line:84%
to my first day of
culturing cells,

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.710 align:middle line:84%
my very first experiment
with culturing cells.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.639 align:middle line:84%
And my mentor, Irv Konigsberg,
a brilliant scientist,

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:59.930 align:middle line:84%
was telling me, just as I
was putting my first cultures

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.667 align:middle line:84%
into the incubator,
he said, "When

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:04.000 align:middle line:84%
you come back tomorrow morning
and look at these cells,"

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.500 align:middle line:84%
he said, "if they don't look
well, they look sick," he said,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.169 align:middle line:84%
"before you blame
the cells for this,

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.000 align:middle line:84%
the first thing
you must consider

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.280 align:middle line:84%
are the conditions in the
environment, the culture

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.400 align:middle line:90%
conditions."

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was funny because
that remark seeded an idea,

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.160 align:middle line:84%
but it didn't realize itself
for almost 20 years later

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.440 align:middle line:84%
when I realized at that point
that, indeed, the cells were

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.440 align:middle line:84%
directly responding
to their environment,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.420 align:middle line:84%
and not responding to some
program in their genes.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>Now, this is not what
traditional medicine

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.460 align:middle line:90%
is saying even to this day.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>To this very day, they're
still behind the concept

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.602 align:middle line:84%
that we are genetic automatons,
and that our characteristics

00:02:42.602 --> 00:02:45.520 align:middle line:84%
and our traits that we
express in our lives

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.790 align:middle line:84%
are really tied to the
blueprints of the DNA

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.490 align:middle line:90%
that we received at birth.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So the significance is is that
conventional medicine sees us

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.160 align:middle line:84%
as a robotic device, and that
our attributes or deficiencies

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.420 align:middle line:84%
are merely a reflection or
an expression of the genes

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.270 align:middle line:84%
that we acquired during
the conception process.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.110 align:middle line:84%
So that our fate is more or less
an unfoldment of our genetics,

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.210 align:middle line:84%
which is a concept called
genetic determinism,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.120 align:middle line:84%
a belief that our
characters are already

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.970 align:middle line:84%
predetermined at the moment
of conception and our life

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.680 align:middle line:84%
is just an unfoldment
from that point.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>Which, as you have pointed out
in the past, and to audiences

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.310 align:middle line:84%
worldwide, that makes
us victims of our genes.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.011 align:middle line:84%
So this creates a
mindset with it.

00:03:29.011 --> 00:03:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.210 align:middle line:84%
So the people look at their
illnesses or their problems

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.020 align:middle line:84%
in life as being something
they have no control over,

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.140 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, it forces us
to go outside of ourselves

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.270 align:middle line:90%
to seek help and answers.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.200 align:middle line:84%
When, in fact, the new biology
reveals that all that healing

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.870 align:middle line:90%
ability was always within us.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Which, if you think about
it in an evolutionary sense,

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.470 align:middle line:84%
there were people, humans
here for a million years

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.170 align:middle line:90%
before there was medicine.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.400 align:middle line:84%
They obviously
survived very well

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.200 align:middle line:90%
and did very well self healing.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the new
biology is taking us back to,

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.742 align:middle line:84%
is that, before we saw
ourselves as victims.

00:04:04.742 --> 00:04:06.950 align:middle line:84%
If there was something wrong,
we'd go to the outside.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.490 align:middle line:84%
We'd look for a
drug or a chemical

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:84%
to correct the
functioning of the system.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, with the new
biology, we're recognizing

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.329 align:middle line:84%
that we can adjust
our own chemistry,

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.890 align:middle line:84%
but we have to do it through
our consciousness and our issues

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.300 align:middle line:84%
of our perceptions of
how we see the world.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And why that's
really a freeing up

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.370 align:middle line:84%
is that-- think about it
this way-- it's easier

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.269 align:middle line:84%
to change your perceptions than
it is to change your genes.

00:04:31.269 --> 00:04:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And that when we
recognize that perceptions

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.120 align:middle line:84%
run the show, when we start
emphasizing our beliefs

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.930 align:middle line:84%
and our psychology
behind our health,

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.720 align:middle line:84%
that is a
self-empowering process.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>Going back to the
medical world as it

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.210 align:middle line:90%
exists today for just a moment.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.120 align:middle line:84%
If you're watching
television, it

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.990 align:middle line:84%
seems as though now a very high
percentage of the advertising

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.160 align:middle line:84%
behind news programs, prime-time
programming, et cetera,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.890 align:middle line:84%
is pharmaceutically-based
advertising.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, at this
point, before we

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.170 align:middle line:84%
go into what the new biology
is and the actual percentage

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.190 align:middle line:84%
of how much we are
determined by our genes,

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.670 align:middle line:84%
even if this is now known
and has been proven,

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.880 align:middle line:84%
what's it going to take
for the medical industry

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.980 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge this when
there's so much vested

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.810 align:middle line:90%
in pharmaceuticals?

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, it's a
wonderful question,

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.069 align:middle line:84%
and the same question can
apply to another issue, which

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:24.610 align:middle line:84%
is a parallel, so
that people can see

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.485 align:middle line:84%
that there-- the parallels
between these two.

00:05:26.485 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And that is, we are very
much familiar with the fact

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.190 align:middle line:84%
that there are many
different forms of energy

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.720 align:middle line:84%
than burning fossil
fuel, that many

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.250 align:middle line:84%
of these other forms
of energy are much more

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.170 align:middle line:84%
efficient and more practical
for us to be using.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you say,
well, then how come

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.470 align:middle line:84%
we are so limited
by the fossil fuels?

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is because
the petroleum industry's

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.740 align:middle line:90%
selling fossil fuels.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.810 align:middle line:90%
They're not selling free energy.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And then the parallel
exists, is that

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.160 align:middle line:84%
the pharmaceutical industry
sells chemical medicine.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>>Cures.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>>Chemistry.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And if I can suggest that you
can heal yourself with energy,

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.010 align:middle line:84%
well, they can't sell the energy
so they're not interested.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.080 align:middle line:84%
So the issue is, it's a
bias toward a product.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And this bias, from an industry
that has that much money,

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.270 align:middle line:84%
is restricting us from
the evolution that

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.050 align:middle line:84%
is in front of us,
because as long

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.330 align:middle line:84%
as they keep diverting
our attention

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.430 align:middle line:84%
and selling drugs
as a belief system,

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.390 align:middle line:84%
because most drugs are no
better than placebo anyway.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Even the largest selling drug in
the world, for example, Prozac,

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.360 align:middle line:84%
is scientifically
demonstrated to be

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.470 align:middle line:90%
no better than a sugar pill.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.935 align:middle line:90%
And yet, my god, the billions--

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:34.559 align:middle line:90%
>>Side effects.

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>--of dollars and-- Well,
that's the interesting thing

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.625 align:middle line:90%
about-- they could sell placebo.

00:06:38.625 --> 00:06:40.510 align:middle line:84%
It would be safer,
because placebos

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:middle line:90%
don't have side effects.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>And yet, they sell us a
placebo with side effects,

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and so the issue is,
what's the difference?

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And the difference is
that the placebo is really

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.090 align:middle line:84%
just an effect that
says, by my mind,

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.190 align:middle line:84%
I take a drug with the
intention of healing myself.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.790 align:middle line:84%
I give the power to the
drug, but it was really

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:59.780 align:middle line:90%
the intention.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.790 align:middle line:84%
So taking a drug, whether it's
a sugar pill or a real drug,

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.840 align:middle line:84%
it's still the
intention of healing

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.600 align:middle line:90%
that I'm putting into my system.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's where the
power comes from.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>So let's backtrack now
and go to the new biology,

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and talk about just
how little of what

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:84%
we are has actually
been determined

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:18.600 align:middle line:90%
by our genetic structure.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.211 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, the genes
are very important.

00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:22.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to just say
that genes aren't important.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Genes are blueprints,
number one,

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.980 align:middle line:84%
and they're blueprints
to make proteins.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.675 align:middle line:84%
And the proteins are the
building block molecules

00:07:29.675 --> 00:07:30.690 align:middle line:90%
of the human body.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.070 align:middle line:84%
It's like a giant
Tinkertoy set with all

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.315 align:middle line:90%
these different shaped parts.

00:07:34.315 --> 00:07:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And the parts are
the proteins, and you

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.870 align:middle line:84%
start to plug them
together and assemble them.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And from that assembly, you can
create all the different kinds

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.200 align:middle line:84%
of cells, liver cells,
brain cells, heart cells

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.280 align:middle line:84%
by different assemblies
of these proteins.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.620 align:middle line:84%
So the genes are important
because they provide

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.670 align:middle line:84%
the blueprints to
make the proteins.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Yet we've gone
beyond, giving them

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.260 align:middle line:84%
powers that they
don't really have.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.360 align:middle line:84%
We give them powers of,
like, self-actualization,

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.631 align:middle line:90%
like, a gene decides to turn on.

00:08:00.631 --> 00:08:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Like, I'm having a wonderful
day, and all of a sudden,

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.254 align:middle line:84%
one of my genes
says, well, today

00:08:04.254 --> 00:08:05.700 align:middle line:90%
is a great day for cancer.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.546 align:middle line:90%
Let's turn on and have cancer.

00:08:07.546 --> 00:08:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And so, all of a
sudden, we start

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.880 align:middle line:84%
to give power that these genes
are, in a sense, controlling

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.050 align:middle line:84%
us, when in fact, no,
they are blueprints.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.034 align:middle line:84%
And as a blueprint,
they provide a pattern,

00:08:19.034 --> 00:08:20.450 align:middle line:84%
but they don't
tell you how you're

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.420 align:middle line:90%
going to use the material.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.034 align:middle line:84%
They just say, here's
a building block.

00:08:25.034 --> 00:08:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And yet, how you're going
to use that building block

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.260 align:middle line:90%
isn't determined by the gene.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.320 align:middle line:84%
It's determined by
the consciousness

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.850 align:middle line:84%
of the individual who's
running the biology.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.169 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense,
conventional biology

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:39.220 align:middle line:84%
perceives of the
body as a vehicle.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.530 align:middle line:84%
But in the conventional
biology, it's

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.799 align:middle line:84%
a vehicle that's driven
by an automatic pilot

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:47.220 align:middle line:84%
like an autopilot, and that
the autopilot are the genes.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.890 align:middle line:84%
So that how the vehicle
drives, and the character

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.860 align:middle line:84%
of the vehicle, and the
attributes or deficiencies,

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.440 align:middle line:84%
you can say, well, that has to
do with the autopilot genes.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.080 align:middle line:84%
The big mistake is is that,
partly, they're right.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.570 align:middle line:84%
The genes are indeed
involved with building blocks

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.390 align:middle line:84%
to make the vehicle, but they've
had a big mistake in regard

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.810 align:middle line:90%
who's driving the vehicle.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>>And this is where
your new biology

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:10.660 align:middle line:90%
starts really kicking in.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, just for a
moment, to take percentages,

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.565 align:middle line:84%
you've written that
anywhere from only 2% to 5%

00:09:17.565 --> 00:09:21.080 align:middle line:84%
of the disease, for example,
that our bodies manifest

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.920 align:middle line:84%
is completely or
absolutely driven solely

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.460 align:middle line:84%
by our genetic
structure, our DNA.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.690 align:middle line:90%
The rest is--?

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>>An interaction of the DNA
and the character and quality

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.560 align:middle line:90%
of which we run our lives.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So for example, go
back to the vehicle.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.190 align:middle line:84%
The vehicle comes off
the assembly line,

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.710 align:middle line:84%
and there are two potential
buyers of this vehicle.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.825 align:middle line:84%
So you have, like, let's
say, an older woman who's

00:09:41.825 --> 00:09:44.450 align:middle line:84%
going to drive this car, and you
have this young teenager who's

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.540 align:middle line:90%
going to drive the car.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Same vehicle comes off, but
the fate of that vehicle

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.810 align:middle line:84%
is really which of the drivers
is going to own that vehicle.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.480 align:middle line:84%
If the teenager
drives that vehicle

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.740 align:middle line:84%
and starts hitting the gas, and
hitting the brakes, and racing,

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.872 align:middle line:84%
and all that, it's more
likely that vehicle--

00:09:58.872 --> 00:10:00.319 align:middle line:90%
>>Or a different system.

00:10:00.319 --> 00:10:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>>Actually, well, that's
the drive vehicle,

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:03.940 align:middle line:84%
that's the mechanism
that makes it go.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.410 align:middle line:84%
If a teenager's
driving, it's going

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.730 align:middle line:84%
to have a completely different
effect on the vehicle

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.540 align:middle line:84%
than if this older person is
going to drive the car, which

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.710 align:middle line:84%
will also have another
effect on the vehicle.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.422 align:middle line:84%
So then, when I talk
about down the road,

00:10:14.422 --> 00:10:16.380 align:middle line:84%
and I have this vehicle
and it's in a junkyard,

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.755 align:middle line:84%
and you say, well,
what happened?

00:10:17.755 --> 00:10:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Was it because they
built the vehicle wrong?

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
no, the vehicle

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.570 align:middle line:90%
was probably pretty good.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.670 align:middle line:84%
It was the driver who
was responsible for how

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.750 align:middle line:84%
to handle the car, and
to maintain the car,

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.080 align:middle line:90%
and take care of the car.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And those that take care
of the car, the car lasts.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And those that beat
it up and abuse it,

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.560 align:middle line:90%
it's in the junkyard faster.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.860 align:middle line:84%
The bodies are the same
things as these vehicles.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.014 align:middle line:84%
It depends on how you
want operate your vehicle.

00:10:41.014 --> 00:10:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
why that's different

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.180 align:middle line:84%
is, it gives power
to the driver,

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.640 align:middle line:84%
while the conventional belief
gives power to the genes.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is the big difference,
because if it's your genes

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.440 align:middle line:84%
and you don't select your
genes, as far as we know,

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.350 align:middle line:84%
you can't change your
genes as far as we know.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.490 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, I say,
well, I have these genes,

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't pick them,
and I can't change them,

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:04.430 align:middle line:84%
and I'm powerless because the
genes are running the show,

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.919 align:middle line:90%
we become victims.

00:11:05.919 --> 00:11:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you turn around
and say, no, wait.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.240 align:middle line:84%
The genes make the vehicle,
but how you use the vehicle's

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.750 align:middle line:84%
how you drive the vehicle and
how you learn how to drive it.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Why that's important is because,
via different ways of learning

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.270 align:middle line:84%
how to drive or different
driver education,

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.040 align:middle line:84%
you can make a vehicle last,
or you can kill a vehicle

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.590 align:middle line:84%
very quickly, and it
wasn't the vehicle's fault.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.800 align:middle line:84%
So our tendency is
to blame the vehicle

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.930 align:middle line:84%
and ignore the
consequence of the driver.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.901 align:middle line:84%
And the new biology
is saying you better

00:11:29.901 --> 00:11:31.650 align:middle line:84%
look at who's driving,
how you're driving,

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.930 align:middle line:84%
and this is especially true
with cardiovascular disease

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:35.790 align:middle line:90%
and cancer.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And just interestingly,
just even

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.170 align:middle line:84%
in the last week, the
American Cancer Society

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.795 align:middle line:84%
revealed that 60%
or more of cancer

00:11:42.795 --> 00:11:46.940 align:middle line:84%
is avoidable by simply
changing diet or lifestyle.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
profound statement,

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:84%
because up to recent times,
cancer was a genetic disease.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.965 align:middle line:84%
Now we're finding, no,
the largest majority

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:57.756 align:middle line:84%
of cancer-- and I think
their estimates are

00:11:57.756 --> 00:12:00.200 align:middle line:84%
conservative at
60%, I believe it's

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.779 align:middle line:84%
a lot more-- the cancer is
a lifestyle consideration.

00:12:04.779 --> 00:12:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Cardiovascular disease, you want
to blame your heart and say,

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.120 align:middle line:90%
my heart is not supporting me.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is,
well, if you're not

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:84%
driving the vehicle
correctly, if you're

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.960 align:middle line:84%
the kind of person
who hits the brakes

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.130 align:middle line:84%
and then pushes your foot on the
gas, and then hits the brakes,

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.250 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
stress the system.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.010 align:middle line:84%
When you have a
heart problem, it's

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:24.750 align:middle line:84%
just manifesting
that you have stress.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough,
conventional medicine blames

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.060 align:middle line:84%
the vehicle, says the
heart has a problem.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:34.216 align:middle line:84%
They provide medicines to try
to slow down the deterioration.

00:12:34.216 --> 00:12:35.590 align:middle line:84%
They don't even
provide medicines

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:37.630 align:middle line:84%
to build the heart
back up again.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.890 align:middle line:84%
They're just lucky if
they can slow it down.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Dean Ornish, a physician
in San Francisco,

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.160 align:middle line:84%
wrote a wonderful
book on his research

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.940 align:middle line:84%
that revealed that he
took cardiac patients.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.330 align:middle line:90%
He didn't give them medications.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.290 align:middle line:84%
He said, what if I just
give you different ways

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.460 align:middle line:90%
to handle stress?

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.850 align:middle line:84%
How about if I show you a
better way to, like, mediate,

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:57.760 align:middle line:90%
and to get centered?

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And how about if I
provide you with a better

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.687 align:middle line:90%
kind of diet for your lifestyle?

00:13:02.687 --> 00:13:05.020 align:middle line:84%
In other words, he changed
the parameters of their life,

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.780 align:middle line:90%
but didn't provide any drugs.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.630 align:middle line:84%
The amazing results,
which were published,

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.170 align:middle line:84%
revealed not only
did his patients,

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:15.450 align:middle line:84%
actually, the deterioration
stop, but they actually

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:17.180 align:middle line:90%
showed the heart got better.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And no other study
has ever shown that.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And what it really reveals
is what I was trying to say

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.210 align:middle line:84%
is if I change how
I drive my vehicle,

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:26.210 align:middle line:84%
my vehicle was never
really defective,

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and it will come back
again if I do it correctly,

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.260 align:middle line:84%
if I drive in a
healthy, sane manner.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>>What are some other
diseases that you're

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:38.150 align:middle line:84%
finding have more to do with our
belief systems and lifestyle?

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>Autoimmune diseases.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Autoimmune means
self-destruction.

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And so it's your
own immune system

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:45.930 align:middle line:84%
is taking you apart
from the inside.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Again, we look at
it as a mechanism.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.910 align:middle line:84%
We say, well, something must
be wrong with the genes,

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.490 align:middle line:84%
because look, these cells
are destroying ourselves.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:56.990 align:middle line:84%
When it turns out, no, it
is our own consciousness

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.120 align:middle line:84%
driving ourselves into
the ground with beliefs

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.280 align:middle line:90%
that are self-destructive.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:04.170 align:middle line:84%
The kind of beliefs that we are
given, especially as children,

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:84%
very limiting and
self-sabotaging beliefs

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.360 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, you won't
amount to very much,

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.460 align:middle line:84%
or you're not a smart person,
or you don't deserve things.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.377 align:middle line:84%
When children,
especially under six,

00:14:13.377 --> 00:14:15.210 align:middle line:84%
hear these kind of
comments like, oh, you're

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:19.140 align:middle line:84%
a stupid child, you're a sickly
child, we haven't, up to now,

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.730 align:middle line:84%
recognized that
a child under six

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.400 align:middle line:84%
is not conscious like you
and I are when we're adults.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.240 align:middle line:84%
That we can understand if
a parent yells and says,

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.850 align:middle line:84%
you're a stupid kid,
they don't really

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.210 align:middle line:90%
mean that you're a stupid kid.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:34.960 align:middle line:84%
They probably mean that they're
just anxious about something

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.160 align:middle line:84%
they need to do, and
the child's acting up,

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and they're just irritated, and
they're yelling at the child.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And so the child hears
they're a stupid kid.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.180 align:middle line:84%
If the child is
over six or seven,

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.890 align:middle line:84%
the child has consciousness
enough to say,

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.140 align:middle line:84%
well, I can see
mom is just upset,

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.560 align:middle line:84%
and she's just saying
that because she's upset.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.290 align:middle line:84%
But we now recognize that
a child less than six,

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:59.280 align:middle line:84%
essentially, is not in that
state of consciousness.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.320 align:middle line:84%
They're more in a
hypnotic trance.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's a period
of intense learning

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:06.380 align:middle line:84%
of how a child is to fit into
this community of the family,

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.930 align:middle line:84%
and how the family fits into the
community of life around them,

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.630 align:middle line:90%
and how you fit into the world.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.150 align:middle line:90%
That's what's being learned.

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:16.060 align:middle line:84%
A child less than six,
if they had consciousness

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.530 align:middle line:84%
and they were trying
to learn this,

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:19.530 align:middle line:84%
their thoughts would
interfere with the download

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:20.360 align:middle line:90%
of the program.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.360 align:middle line:84%
So nature designed
it so children really

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.540 align:middle line:84%
don't show the kind
of consciousness

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.570 align:middle line:90%
as we show until about six.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Meaning the first six years
of its life, what it sees

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.720 align:middle line:84%
and what it hears
are just downloaded

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.600 align:middle line:90%
as this is the way life is.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.415 align:middle line:84%
And why that's relevant is then
if the same parent is yelling,

00:15:38.415 --> 00:15:41.340 align:middle line:84%
you're a stupid kid,
because they're irritated,

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.710 align:middle line:84%
and the child is less
than six, the child's

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.380 align:middle line:84%
not thinking in
consciousness of trying

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.630 align:middle line:90%
to understand what's going on.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.780 align:middle line:84%
It's just a download,
I'm a stupid kid.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we have
failed to recognize

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.290 align:middle line:84%
is that those pronouncements
are lodged in our subconscious

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:55.074 align:middle line:90%
mind.

00:15:55.074 --> 00:15:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And it is now recognized
that our subconscious

00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:00.920 align:middle line:84%
mind runs 85% to
95% of our life.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.730 align:middle line:84%
So if we came through
a family where

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:05.340 align:middle line:84%
there was this kind
of talk from a parent,

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.300 align:middle line:84%
you know, irritated
parents, and talking

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.850 align:middle line:84%
to kids like this, a child
that grows up in that family,

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:12.920 align:middle line:84%
when they get older and that
is a fundamental learned thing,

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.800 align:middle line:84%
I am a stupid child, or I
do not deserve something,

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.070 align:middle line:84%
and that's built
into my subconscious,

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.830 align:middle line:84%
then when I'm older
and 85%, 95% of my life

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.567 align:middle line:84%
is run by that
subconscious, that's

00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:24.650 align:middle line:90%
a program that's in there.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.090 align:middle line:90%
It says, I'm stupid.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:29.201 align:middle line:84%
Now, where the problem
comes from is this.

00:16:29.201 --> 00:16:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Is that there are these
two minds, the conscious

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.760 align:middle line:84%
and a subconscious, and
they work in tandem.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.800 align:middle line:84%
That when you're operating
from consciousness,

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.030 align:middle line:90%
then you're running the show.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.363 align:middle line:90%
You put your hands on the wheel.

00:16:38.363 --> 00:16:39.442 align:middle line:90%
You drive the vehicle.

00:16:39.442 --> 00:16:40.900 align:middle line:84%
But most of the
time, if you think,

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.060 align:middle line:90%
where is our consciousness?

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness is,
like, daydreaming, thinking

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.510 align:middle line:84%
of the future, of some
kind of event or something

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:49.590 align:middle line:84%
you want in your life, or
thinking about the past.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Who did what to who,
and what were the events

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.040 align:middle line:84%
that were important
in your life?

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, the point is, if my
consciousness is thinking

00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:00.060 align:middle line:84%
in the future or in the past,
which is its predominant place,

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.712 align:middle line:84%
then it says, well, who's
running the show at the moment?

00:17:02.712 --> 00:17:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
that's where you find out,

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:06.284 align:middle line:90%
well, that was the subconscious.

00:17:06.284 --> 00:17:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, here comes the conflict,
so most people should really

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.099 align:middle line:90%
understand this.

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:12.109 align:middle line:84%
Is that when the
subconscious is running it

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and the conscious is busy,
the conscious being busy,

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.510 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't observe
what the behavior is

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.189 align:middle line:84%
that's coming from
the subconscious.

00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:20.730 align:middle line:84%
So for example, many
of us, including

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:24.377 align:middle line:84%
myself, who have driven
a car for a long time

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:26.210 align:middle line:84%
realize that you don't
have to pay attention

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:27.584 align:middle line:84%
to the details of
driving the car

00:17:27.584 --> 00:17:29.980 align:middle line:84%
like you did the first day
you have a driver's permit.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And you got in the
car and you were just

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.040 align:middle line:84%
mind boggled by all the things
you had to keep conscious,

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.320 align:middle line:84%
like looking out the
mirror, watching the gauges,

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.020 align:middle line:84%
making sure the pedals
are working properly,

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.170 align:middle line:90%
looking out the windows.

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And all this stuff
was, like, too much

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.550 align:middle line:90%
for the conscious mind.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:46.120 align:middle line:84%
But then you realized
after you learn

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.206 align:middle line:84%
how to drive a car
for a while, you never

00:17:48.206 --> 00:17:49.580 align:middle line:84%
really think about
those details.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:50.996 align:middle line:84%
That you could
just get in the car

00:17:50.996 --> 00:17:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and you could be
daydreaming about the party

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.954 align:middle line:90%
you're going to go to.

00:17:55.954 --> 00:17:57.870 align:middle line:84%
If I make one point,
maybe people will get it,

00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.065 align:middle line:90%
and it's this.

00:17:59.065 --> 00:18:00.815 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I'm in that
car and I'm driving.

00:18:00.815 --> 00:18:02.356 align:middle line:84%
And let's say, for
example, someone's

00:18:02.356 --> 00:18:03.760 align:middle line:90%
in the passenger seat.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And I get so involved in
the discussion with them

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:11.590 align:middle line:84%
that, sometime, I look out the
window and in a sheepish way

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I realize I haven't
paid attention

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.410 align:middle line:84%
to the road for the
last five minutes.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:17.089 align:middle line:90%
My consciousness was engaged.

00:18:17.089 --> 00:18:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously, I'm
still driving the car,

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and your car's driving OK, so
my driving was under control.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, who was
driving the vehicle?

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
well, I have two minds,

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:27.410 align:middle line:90%
conscious or subconscious.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.035 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can tell you,
my conscious mind

00:18:29.035 --> 00:18:30.670 align:middle line:90%
was engaged in the conversation.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.820 align:middle line:84%
That leaves my subconscious
as driving the vehicle

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.190 align:middle line:90%
which, in fact, it was.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:37.090 align:middle line:84%
That's what the subconscious
does best, very complex details

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:39.350 align:middle line:90%
without my having to watch them.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:42.870 align:middle line:84%
The critical point about this
whole little story is this.

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.710 align:middle line:84%
While you were in
the conversation

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.510 align:middle line:84%
and you weren't paying
attention, if I ask you,

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:49.510 align:middle line:84%
did you observe the
character of how

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:51.695 align:middle line:84%
you drove the car in that
10 minute period when

00:18:51.695 --> 00:18:53.070 align:middle line:84%
you didn't see
what was going on?

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.278 align:middle line:90%
The answer is, of course not.

00:18:54.278 --> 00:18:56.880 align:middle line:84%
You didn't even know, you know,
you weren't paying attention

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.250 align:middle line:90%
to that.

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:01.060 align:middle line:84%
That is the point that
I really want to make.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.004 align:middle line:84%
When your consciousness
is engaged,

00:19:03.004 --> 00:19:04.170 align:middle line:90%
the subconscious takes over.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:05.440 align:middle line:90%
It drove the car.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.430 align:middle line:84%
But the critical
factor was this.

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Because the consciousness
was engaged,

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.950 align:middle line:84%
it didn't observe
the behavior that

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:14.540 align:middle line:84%
was being run by
that subconscious.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.920 align:middle line:84%
So that if I have a
behavior that says,

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't deserve something,
and I'm doing some job,

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.140 align:middle line:84%
and yet I'm thinking about
the vacation that's coming up,

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.931 align:middle line:84%
and my subconscious is
running the show, and it says,

00:19:25.931 --> 00:19:27.930 align:middle line:84%
well, you know, if you
think about it logically,

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.280 align:middle line:84%
if I do the job right,
I'm going to get a raise.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, but I have a program that
says, I don't deserve things.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.070 align:middle line:90%
I got that when I was a kid.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm not
paying attention,

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:38.720 align:middle line:84%
when I'm thinking
about the vacation,

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.380 align:middle line:84%
and I start doing
things, I'm going

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.990 align:middle line:84%
to make little
glitches and accidents.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Not because my
conscious was saying so,

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:47.880 align:middle line:84%
but my subconscious
said, you don't deserve.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I do
everything right, that

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle line:84%
means I should get the reward,
but if I start making mistakes,

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:53.530 align:middle line:90%
then guess what?

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:55.070 align:middle line:90%
I won't deserve.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And so, the point is, it
becomes a fulfilling prophecy

00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.830 align:middle line:90%
if I'm told I'm stupid.

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Many of us take
exams, for example,

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.279 align:middle line:90%
and get the exams back.

00:20:03.279 --> 00:20:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And then look at some
questions, you think,

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.370 align:middle line:84%
my goodness, I knew the
answer to that question,

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:09.650 align:middle line:84%
and I marked it wrong,
and I knew the answer.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:11.510 align:middle line:90%
What was the point?

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.320 align:middle line:84%
If your subconscious
mind was programmed

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.419 align:middle line:84%
that you were, let's
say, an average student,

00:20:15.419 --> 00:20:17.210 align:middle line:84%
an average student
can't get 'em all right.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.130 align:middle line:84%
An average student has to get
C. So what does that mean?

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:21.855 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you're
not paying attention,

00:20:21.855 --> 00:20:23.480 align:middle line:84%
the moment you're
not paying attention,

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.980 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious
mind says, average?

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, I need to get only 70%
right, so I need to miss a few.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.647 align:middle line:84%
And it'll start checking
off wrong answers on ones

00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:33.230 align:middle line:84%
that you actually
know the answer for.

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.188 align:middle line:84%
And then, two days later,
you get the exam back

00:20:35.188 --> 00:20:37.250 align:middle line:84%
and you, yourself,
are totally surprised.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.660 align:middle line:84%
How would I marked the wrong
answer, and I knew that?

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And the point was,
subconscious was

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.310 align:middle line:84%
running the show
pretty much then.

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>>So let's take this
and extrapolate that

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:48.200 align:middle line:90%
into our biology.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And first of all,
the subconscious,

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:53.625 align:middle line:84%
as you have written,
it likes repetition,

00:20:53.625 --> 00:20:57.520 align:middle line:84%
it likes familiarity, meaning
these programs that are now

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.430 align:middle line:84%
in our subconscious
were probably

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:02.300 align:middle line:84%
created with repetition
and have become familiar,

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.920 align:middle line:84%
maybe over a period
of time, maybe

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.260 align:middle line:90%
through a traumatic event.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:09.570 align:middle line:84%
But give us a diagram of, say,
a middle-aged woman, breast

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.410 align:middle line:84%
cancer, and how that could have
started within their being.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And I know there are a
thousand ways, but just--

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>There are a thousand,
but I can give you a good--

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:15.498 align:middle line:90%
>>Just give an example.

00:21:15.498 --> 00:21:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>I'll give you an example.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:19.120 align:middle line:84%
We live in a world that's
a male-dominated world,

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:19.870 align:middle line:90%
patriarchal world.

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:20.950 align:middle line:90%
It's clear.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:24.530 align:middle line:84%
If you're a woman in this world,
you're already second class.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:26.890 align:middle line:84%
You still have to
fight higher, OK?

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:28.070 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a woman.

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:30.710 align:middle line:84%
I find this world
very stressful to me.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:32.415 align:middle line:84%
My conscious mind
is thinking, oh,

00:21:32.415 --> 00:21:33.790 align:middle line:84%
what am I going
to do about this?

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:35.373 align:middle line:84%
Myself subconscious
mind's very clear.

00:21:35.373 --> 00:21:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Says, well, I look
out at the world.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:38.700 align:middle line:90%
It's very obvious.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:42.450 align:middle line:84%
If I were not a woman, I
would be in a better position.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, what way would
I not be a woman?

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:47.510 align:middle line:84%
How about if we eliminate
our secondary sexual

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:48.550 align:middle line:90%
characteristics?

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Not that the conscious mind
had any involvement with this.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.421 align:middle line:84%
It was just the quantification
of data in the subconscious

00:21:55.421 --> 00:21:57.420 align:middle line:84%
mind that said, yeah,
that would be a good idea.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.836 align:middle line:84%
But of course that
would mean then

00:21:58.836 --> 00:22:02.020 align:middle line:84%
removing breasts as
part of your character.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And so you start to destroy
your own breasts as what?

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
giving me problems,

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.742 align:middle line:84%
because they were making me
a woman in a man's world.

00:22:09.742 --> 00:22:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And so it had nothing to
do with consciousness,

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.420 align:middle line:90%
but it had to do with stress.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.429 align:middle line:84%
The stress of trying
to survive in a world

00:22:16.429 --> 00:22:18.220 align:middle line:84%
where you're already
at a disadvantage why?

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.922 align:middle line:90%
Because you have breasts.

00:22:19.922 --> 00:22:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And so the system will say,
yeah, I can help you with that.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.050 align:middle line:84%
I'll get rid of those
breasts for you.

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:26.027 align:middle line:84%
And yet, that's
self-destruction.

00:22:26.027 --> 00:22:27.485 align:middle line:84%
And yet, well, if
you didn't handle

00:22:27.485 --> 00:22:30.230 align:middle line:84%
the stress in any other
way, then what other ways

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:32.612 align:middle line:84%
are you leaving for the
system to handle the stress?

00:22:32.612 --> 00:22:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's
where the difference

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.760 align:middle line:84%
of not dealing with
it in consciousness,

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and letting the
subconscious run it,

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:38.620 align:middle line:90%
because it's just very simple.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.110 align:middle line:90%
It says, oh, woman-- problem.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:40.610 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:42.370 align:middle line:90%
No woman, no problem.

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>And it does
become very complex,

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.590 align:middle line:84%
because this gets back to
even brain chemistry, where

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:50.340 align:middle line:84%
other research has, not
indicated, but proven

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.490 align:middle line:84%
that women have much lower
levels of serotonin, the feel

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:57.930 align:middle line:84%
good chemical, than men
do in the same culture.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:59.329 align:middle line:90%
>>Dealing with the stresses.

00:22:59.329 --> 00:23:00.870 align:middle line:84%
So that if I have
to go out every day

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.010 align:middle line:84%
and deal with the stress, how
can I feel good in that world?

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:04.802 align:middle line:84%
And is it conscious
or unconscious?

00:23:04.802 --> 00:23:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
well, as I said,

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.350 align:middle line:84%
consciousness doesn't even spend
most of its time being present.

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is
the one that allows

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.710 align:middle line:84%
us to think outside
of where we are.

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.480 align:middle line:84%
So when we're thinking
outside of where we are,

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.560 align:middle line:90%
we are not being present.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.200 align:middle line:84%
We are now leaving
it to this equivalent

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.230 align:middle line:84%
of a five-year-old
mentality, the subconscious.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And you just tell the
subconscious, ah, hey,

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:26.700 align:middle line:90%
you know, being woman's hard.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.717 align:middle line:84%
So a five-year-kid says,
OK, don't be a woman.

00:23:28.717 --> 00:23:29.800 align:middle line:90%
Well, how can you do that?

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is get rid
of the characteristics

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.820 align:middle line:90%
of being a woman, OK?

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
kinds of things.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:36.780 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
just add one more,

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:37.980 align:middle line:84%
because I think
it's more profound.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:38.688 align:middle line:90%
And that is this.

00:23:38.688 --> 00:23:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I said over millennia,
the human biology

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.790 align:middle line:90%
developed a system to self-heal.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.710 align:middle line:84%
It's always been
able to heal itself.

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we find ourselves,
when anything's wrong,

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:52.160 align:middle line:84%
we can't seem to heal
ourselves, and we always

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.200 align:middle line:90%
go outside to seek help.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.407 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, well,
why would we do that?

00:23:55.407 --> 00:23:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
say, well, perhaps we

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:84%
go back to when you were
developing in utero, which

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.470 align:middle line:84%
is a time when we now know
you're already downloading

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:06.000 align:middle line:84%
the awareness of the world
through your interaction--

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>In fact, you show a
wonderful film in your conf--

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.030 align:middle line:84%
when you present at
conferences of a--

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>>A sonogram.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.143 align:middle line:90%
>>--a sonogram of a, of a--

00:24:14.143 --> 00:24:14.685 align:middle line:90%
>>Of a fetus?

00:24:14.685 --> 00:24:16.101 align:middle line:84%
>>Of a fetus that
has been exposed

00:24:16.101 --> 00:24:17.390 align:middle line:90%
to a violent conversation.

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And what it shows
is that if there's

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:22.940 align:middle line:84%
an argument between, let's
say, the mother and the father,

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.980 align:middle line:84%
that as the mother responds,
which is-- you know,

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:27.950 align:middle line:84%
her response is an
emotional response, well,

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:29.616 align:middle line:84%
how does she have an
emotional response?

00:24:29.616 --> 00:24:32.210 align:middle line:84%
The answer is, well, sends
chemistry through our body,

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:33.942 align:middle line:90%
the chemicals of emotion.

00:24:33.942 --> 00:24:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, so she's going to
have this emotional response.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but if she's
carrying a child,

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:42.160 align:middle line:84%
the elements of the
blood are transferred

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.630 align:middle line:90%
across the placenta.

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And we only talk, usually,
about the nutritional elements,

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:48.319 align:middle line:84%
and that's what's going
to feed the fetus.

00:24:48.319 --> 00:24:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And we've disregarded the
fact that blood carries

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.450 align:middle line:84%
a lot more in it
than just nutrition.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:55.250 align:middle line:84%
It carries emotional chemistry,
and the organizing chemistry--

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>>Hormones?

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>>--d the hormones of the body.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.720 align:middle line:84%
So that if the mother is
responding to her world,

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.860 align:middle line:84%
and she's emotionally
involved with this,

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and her life might
be in, you know,

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:06.870 align:middle line:84%
her security
threatened in some way,

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.650 align:middle line:84%
well, that's going to get
her to physiologically get

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:12.350 align:middle line:84%
into a fight or flight response,
and get into a protection

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:13.250 align:middle line:90%
response.

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:15.840 align:middle line:84%
The fetus is a passive
passenger in this case,

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.641 align:middle line:84%
because the blood components
are going to cross the placenta.

00:25:18.641 --> 00:25:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes, the nutrition
is coming across,

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:22.410 align:middle line:84%
but I'm also sending
those hormones across.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So whatever the mother
is experiencing,

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.650 align:middle line:84%
so is the fetus at
that moment, and that's

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:28.080 align:middle line:90%
what the sonogram showed.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.310 align:middle line:84%
That the moment this
argument was occurring,

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:32.160 align:middle line:90%
this fetus was in shock.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.120 align:middle line:84%
It was actually, like, jumping
off the floor of the uterus

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and arching its
back, going like, oh,

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.710 align:middle line:90%
my gosh, involuntarily.

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:42.410 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't actually know why,
except that the chemistry

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:43.540 align:middle line:90%
is causing it to do so.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:48.140 align:middle line:84%
So if the violent arguments
or whatever they are repeat,

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:51.320 align:middle line:84%
and this is a process where
the fetus is on some period,

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.290 align:middle line:84%
getting this
repetitious pattern,

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.670 align:middle line:84%
we already know that by
midway through pregnancy,

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:57.510 align:middle line:90%
patterns are being downloaded.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And anything repeated then
becomes an important point

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:02.280 align:middle line:90%
in the life of that child.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.260 align:middle line:84%
So that a child that comes
from an abusive relationship

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:08.500 align:middle line:84%
between its parents is
going to be carrying

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.780 align:middle line:84%
the character of that abusive
relationship in its memory

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:13.410 align:middle line:90%
even before it's born.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And it applies to the same
thing as-- well, the point

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.715 align:middle line:84%
was about health,
because what you realize

00:26:17.715 --> 00:26:20.240 align:middle line:84%
is that we are born
with doctors present.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.280 align:middle line:84%
There are doctors there
before we're born,

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.140 align:middle line:84%
that you go to doctors on
checkups, and there's the,

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.850 align:middle line:90%
oh, Johnny's got a cold.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:27.690 align:middle line:90%
Johnny's not well.

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:29.260 align:middle line:84%
We have to take
him to the doctor.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Oh, something's
wrong with Johnny.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:31.876 align:middle line:84%
We have to take
him to the doctor.

00:26:31.876 --> 00:26:33.461 align:middle line:84%
Well, Johnny, if
he's less than six,

00:26:33.461 --> 00:26:34.710 align:middle line:90%
is in this programmable state.

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:36.410 align:middle line:90%
So what's the program?

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:39.670 align:middle line:84%
Johnny realizes that when he's
physiologically not in balance,

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:43.980 align:middle line:84%
when he's in a dis-eased
state, that rather than Johnny

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.160 align:middle line:84%
fixing himself, the first
step is to go to the doctor.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Because the program
is, you're sick?

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:51.920 align:middle line:84%
First, we go to the doctor, then
the doctor will do something,

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.070 align:middle line:90%
and then you'll get well.

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's interesting
because this

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:57.770 align:middle line:84%
is a program that interferes
with our innate ability

00:26:57.770 --> 00:26:58.520 align:middle line:90%
to heal ourselves.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Because it inserts a little
step as like a first step.

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:02.802 align:middle line:90%
OK, you're sick.

00:27:02.802 --> 00:27:04.510 align:middle line:84%
You can heal yourself,
but the first step

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:05.890 align:middle line:90%
is you have to go to the doctor.

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:07.764 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
because a lot of people

00:27:07.764 --> 00:27:10.410 align:middle line:84%
actually start to get better
as they're going to the doctor,

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:12.440 align:middle line:84%
because they're just
fulfilling the step.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Because the rest of it
is innate healing anyway.

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.380 align:middle line:84%
So we throw a little
stumbling block in the program

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.747 align:middle line:84%
by saying before you can
activate your own healing,

00:27:19.747 --> 00:27:21.080 align:middle line:90%
you have to go visit the doctor.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>>Is this like when you take
your car into the mechanic,

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.490 align:middle line:90%
it gets better on the way?

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:26.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>You know, you
laugh, and yet, it's

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:30.840 align:middle line:84%
really funny but more
serious than that,

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.240 align:middle line:84%
because when you start to get
into the nature of quantum

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.600 align:middle line:84%
mechanics, and energy fields,
and thoughts as energy fields,

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and start to recognize that our
thoughts are directly involved

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:42.240 align:middle line:90%
with creating our lives.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's a hard
thing for a lot

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.203 align:middle line:84%
of people to understand, because
when you really get into this

00:27:46.203 --> 00:27:48.930 align:middle line:84%
and you recognize that our
lives are not accidents.

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Our lives are actually
being programmed

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:55.380 align:middle line:84%
through our own belief systems,
the issues of how we think

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:56.990 align:middle line:90%
and how we respond to the world.

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
don't want to own

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.118 align:middle line:84%
that, because the first thing
you have to step back and say

00:28:01.118 --> 00:28:06.010 align:middle line:84%
is, I am responsible for
the world and my actions

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:06.960 align:middle line:90%
in this world.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And then the quantum
physics says, yeah,

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.760 align:middle line:84%
but it also extends to
things around you as well.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>>Very true.

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:15.762 align:middle line:84%
This is the good news, bad
news part of all of this.

00:28:15.762 --> 00:28:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And actually, let's get to
the good news, bad news,

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:21.360 align:middle line:84%
which is that,
yes, we can control

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.740 align:middle line:84%
our destiny, our health,
the quality of our life

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.570 align:middle line:90%
to a very large extent.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:29.010 align:middle line:84%
The bad news is, we've been
programmed to not take control,

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:31.470 align:middle line:84%
and now we're scared to
step out of that box.

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:36.930 align:middle line:84%
But let's use biology itself
to explain why this is true.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.130 align:middle line:90%
Just if you can.

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:39.653 align:middle line:90%
I know it's asking a lot of you.

00:28:39.653 --> 00:28:42.070 align:middle line:84%
You don't have all your
tools and slides right now.

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:45.130 align:middle line:84%
But can you just give us
a little understanding

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:48.340 align:middle line:84%
of the cell, the membrane, how
environmental information is

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.210 align:middle line:84%
programmed into our
cells and proteins,

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.090 align:middle line:90%
and then creates a response?

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:54.800 align:middle line:84%
The first thing is that
we should get everybody

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.540 align:middle line:84%
an understanding
about who cells are,

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:58.374 align:middle line:84%
and what they are in
relation to who we are.

00:28:58.374 --> 00:29:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, we look at
ourselves in the mirror

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.140 align:middle line:84%
and think of ourselves
as a singular entity.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.230 align:middle line:90%
There's Bruce.

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:04.180 align:middle line:90%
I look, I see myself.

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.800 align:middle line:90%
There's this one person.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, that might be one person,
but if I would shrink myself

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:10.840 align:middle line:84%
down to the size
of a cell and then

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.690 align:middle line:84%
look at myself from the
perspective of that size,

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:15.800 align:middle line:84%
I would see that I'm
not a single person.

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm a community made
of 50 trillion cells.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:21.040 align:middle line:84%
It's the cells that are
the living elements.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.580 align:middle line:84%
I am only a collection
of living elements.

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.980 align:middle line:84%
So when I use that
I, that's a global I

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:30.270 align:middle line:84%
representing the consciousness
of 50 trillion cells.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:30.770 align:middle line:90%
so that--

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>>A collective expression?

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>It's a collective expression.

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:35.670 align:middle line:84%
That your body is
actually a community,

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:38.410 align:middle line:84%
and health and disease
now can be reflected.

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And is there harmony in
the community or disharmony

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.960 align:middle line:90%
in the community?

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And all of sudden that all
is like a politic of what's

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:45.670 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:48.564 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to recognize,
well, what are your thoughts?

00:29:48.564 --> 00:29:50.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, your thoughts
represent a central voice,

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.870 align:middle line:84%
the community, all
the inputs coming

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:54.890 align:middle line:84%
from all the cells
and their responses

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:57.080 align:middle line:84%
are like a government
in our head.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And our brain is
more or less reading

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.600 align:middle line:84%
what's going on
throughout our body,

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.860 align:middle line:84%
reading what's going on
in the world around us,

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.570 align:middle line:84%
trying to integrate
our body to live

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:08.270 align:middle line:84%
in harmony with the
world around us.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's all based
on interpretations,

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.910 align:middle line:84%
what the cells are experiencing
and what we are experiencing

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:15.630 align:middle line:84%
outside of ourselves, what
the environment is offering.

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And the relevance about that
is, then when we have thoughts,

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:21.880 align:middle line:84%
we don't realize that our
thoughts are feeding back

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.190 align:middle line:90%
to our cells.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And then if you really go
into our thoughts, which

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:30.210 align:middle line:84%
psychologists tell us 70%
or more of our thoughts

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:33.300 align:middle line:84%
are negative and redundant,
then you think, OK,

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.000 align:middle line:84%
what if you were a
citizen in a nation

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.780 align:middle line:90%
with 50 trillion citizens?

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:39.367 align:middle line:84%
And every day, you
turn on the radio,

00:30:39.367 --> 00:30:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and every day the
government is telling you,

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.035 align:middle line:90%
today is a bad day.

00:30:42.035 --> 00:30:43.160 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to make it.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Life doesn't look really
good for us today.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:46.970 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what are
our chances of success?

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:47.550 align:middle line:90%
Not too good.

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:49.120 align:middle line:90%
Health looks bad.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:52.316 align:middle line:84%
If we hear this every day
on the radio or the TV,

00:30:52.316 --> 00:30:53.690 align:middle line:84%
that this report
keeps coming in,

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:55.930 align:middle line:84%
there's a point where
the population gets

00:30:55.930 --> 00:31:00.140 align:middle line:84%
so weakened by this,
because it just breaks down

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.960 align:middle line:84%
the-- it puts fear
into the system.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.020 align:middle line:90%
And cells are just like people.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:07.490 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they have all the
same functions as people.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And if I tell a cell that
its life is threatened,

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:15.510 align:middle line:84%
it will, like a person,
get into a protection state

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:18.480 align:middle line:84%
to protect itself from
whatever that threat is.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, the interesting
thing about studying

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.330 align:middle line:84%
these cloned cells
is, you realize

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:24.800 align:middle line:84%
that there are two states
of life for a cell.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.280 align:middle line:84%
A cell is either in a state of
growth, taking in nutrients,

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and growing, and becoming
part of the community,

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:35.170 align:middle line:84%
and a matrix making it tight,
or a cell is in protection

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:37.050 align:middle line:90%
if threats are out there.

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, the difference of
growth and protection

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:40.406 align:middle line:84%
is, when you're
in protection, you

00:31:40.406 --> 00:31:41.780 align:middle line:84%
don't become part
of a community.

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Protection is you
wall yourself off.

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you wall
yourself off, you

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:48.660 align:middle line:84%
are now separating yourself
from the community.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>You're not
receiving nutrients.

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:51.031 align:middle line:84%
>>You're not receiving
the nutrients.

00:31:51.031 --> 00:31:51.960 align:middle line:90%
You're in protection.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.630 align:middle line:84%
The best analogy
is, in the old days,

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:56.610 align:middle line:84%
when we were concerned
the Russians we're

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:58.390 align:middle line:84%
going to bomb us, we
built bomb shelters.

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:00.770 align:middle line:84%
So the analogy, now, I'm
going to give you is exactly

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:02.603 align:middle line:84%
the same, whether it's
a community of people

00:32:02.603 --> 00:32:03.620 align:middle line:90%
or a community of cells.

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.486 align:middle line:84%
It's the same for
living organisms.

00:32:05.486 --> 00:32:07.860 align:middle line:84%
So let's use the people because
we're familiar with that.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.100 align:middle line:84%
So let's say we're
in some community,

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:11.150 align:middle line:90%
and it's a wonderful day.

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:14.410 align:middle line:84%
The factories are going,
the community is growing,

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:17.320 align:middle line:84%
they're making things,
the schools are going,

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.520 align:middle line:84%
people are getting education,
the stores are open,

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.780 align:middle line:90%
business is going.

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.431 align:middle line:84%
The community's in a state
of growth, economic growth,

00:32:23.431 --> 00:32:24.180 align:middle line:90%
if you look at it.

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.499 align:middle line:90%
Everything is in process of--

00:32:25.499 --> 00:32:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>>Prosperity.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.142 align:middle line:90%
>>--prosperity.

00:32:27.142 --> 00:32:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden,
there's an air raid alarm.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:30.902 align:middle line:90%
Air raid siren goes off.

00:32:30.902 --> 00:32:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, when the air raid siren
goes off, where do people go?

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.990 align:middle line:90%
They don't stay on the job.

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:37.630 align:middle line:84%
They leave the job and
go into the bomb shelter,

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:39.850 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
protection's going to be.

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:41.454 align:middle line:84%
But then, there's
an immediate point.

00:32:41.454 --> 00:32:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, if people are
in the bomb shelter,

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.477 align:middle line:90%
then what about the job?

00:32:44.477 --> 00:32:45.310 align:middle line:90%
What about the work?

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:46.393 align:middle line:90%
What about the prosperity?

00:32:46.393 --> 00:32:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
well, that's on hold,

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:50.820 align:middle line:84%
because we're in the
bomb shelter right now.

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:54.444 align:middle line:84%
If it's just an alert, you know,
like a test, 10 minutes later,

00:32:54.444 --> 00:32:56.110 align:middle line:84%
everybody comes out
of the bomb shelter,

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:57.109 align:middle line:90%
and you go back to work.

00:32:57.109 --> 00:32:58.210 align:middle line:90%
No big deal.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Just a 10-minute
interruption of the day.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:02.520 align:middle line:90%
But imagine this problem.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.560 align:middle line:90%
The air raid siren goes off.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Everybody leaves the job, and
they go in the bomb shelter,

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.970 align:middle line:90%
but there's no all clear.

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:09.990 align:middle line:90%
What will happen then?

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, well,
they'll stay alive for a while,

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:15.610 align:middle line:84%
as long as they have the
materials in the bomb shelter.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:17.530 align:middle line:84%
But nobody's making
any new materials

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:19.380 align:middle line:84%
because the
factories are closed.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
business going on,

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:23.050 align:middle line:84%
so there's no energy
going, exchanging.

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.130 align:middle line:84%
You have what you have
in your bomb shelter.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:28.220 align:middle line:84%
The moment you use up the
material in the bomb shelter,

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:29.721 align:middle line:84%
you begin to die,
because you're not

00:33:29.721 --> 00:33:31.970 align:middle line:84%
taking anything in any more,
and the work has stopped.

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>How does this look in the body
when we experience trauma or--

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>>The cells shut down
their growth processes,

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:38.500 align:middle line:84%
wall themselves
off in protection

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.220 align:middle line:84%
for an insult of
something coming,

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.689 align:middle line:90%
and they're preparing for this.

00:33:41.689 --> 00:33:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about it is the body

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.420 align:middle line:84%
does have a great
defense system.

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:47.530 align:middle line:84%
But the defense system
was never something

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:50.360 align:middle line:90%
that was designed to run 24/7.

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.680 align:middle line:84%
This defense system was to,
like, OK, something happens?

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.390 align:middle line:90%
Good, we fix it.

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:55.390 align:middle line:90%
We're back on the track.

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's going
back to work again.

00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:01.010 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of anticipating
something that's

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:04.780 align:middle line:84%
going to happen, a threat, and
then getting in that posture,

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:07.320 align:middle line:84%
and holding yourself and
waiting, and waiting,

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.080 align:middle line:84%
and waiting, and waiting,
and there is no resolution.

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Just more threat, more
threat, more threat.

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:17.090 align:middle line:84%
That the cells in the threat
posture, they're not growing.

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:20.889 align:middle line:84%
And so our bodies stop growing,
because it's a simple logic

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:21.389 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:23.710 align:middle line:84%
It says, if I'm going
to have an emergency,

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:25.449 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to need my energy.

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:26.150 align:middle line:90%
To do what?

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:27.674 align:middle line:90%
To run, or fight, or something.

00:34:27.674 --> 00:34:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And I got to
mobilize this energy.

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:33.510 align:middle line:84%
So it would be foolish to
waste energy on something

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:36.060 align:middle line:84%
when you could use
that energy to run.

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.590 align:middle line:84%
If a saber-toothed
tiger is chasing you,

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:40.719 align:middle line:84%
and you start spending
your energy, let's say,

00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:42.620 align:middle line:84%
because you have a
bacterial infection,

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.119 align:middle line:84%
and you start
fighting the bacteria,

00:34:44.119 --> 00:34:45.719 align:middle line:84%
you put energy into
that, maybe you've

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:47.389 align:middle line:84%
put in just the
amount of energy that

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:50.179 align:middle line:84%
would have been needed just
to get your foot from being

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:52.040 align:middle line:84%
in that tiger's mouth
as you're running.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.445 align:middle line:90%
That little bit of extra energy.

00:34:53.445 --> 00:34:54.820 align:middle line:84%
So the intelligence
of the system

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:56.969 align:middle line:84%
says, well, I'm not
going to spend energy

00:34:56.969 --> 00:35:00.830 align:middle line:84%
on things that are
just temporary.

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:03.200 align:middle line:84%
I need to save my energy
because if I need to run,

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.400 align:middle line:90%
I need to run.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.952 align:middle line:90%
So it will shut off growth.

00:35:06.952 --> 00:35:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>>And that brings up
a really good point.

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:11.980 align:middle line:84%
In times past, you had
storms that blew through.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.350 align:middle line:84%
You might have a
saber-tooth on your tail.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:16.960 align:middle line:84%
But today, you're
driving automobiles,

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.180 align:middle line:84%
you're listening to the news,
you're trying to multitask.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:23.760 align:middle line:84%
We have so much more
bombardment of our senses

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.780 align:middle line:84%
and potential for these
negative messages.

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Is this what is taxing
our immune system?

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.700 align:middle line:90%
It attacks the immune system.

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.366 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting,
because I said there's

00:35:33.366 --> 00:35:36.770 align:middle line:84%
parallels that exist between
the body and a nation.

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Because a nation is
a living organism,

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:43.600 align:middle line:84%
where we, for example, are the
cells in the United States,

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.890 align:middle line:84%
and that the United States
is a living organism.

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And as a living
organism, guess what?

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:51.150 align:middle line:84%
It has an adrenal system,
it has an immune system.

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:53.710 align:middle line:84%
The adrenal system is the
Department of Defense.

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:54.490 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:56.560 align:middle line:84%
To mobilize us, to
protect us from things

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.830 align:middle line:84%
that come from outside
and threaten us.

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:00.400 align:middle line:84%
But we also have
an immune system

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.886 align:middle line:90%
within which protects our world.

00:36:03.886 --> 00:36:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And within, it takes
care of the environment,

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.780 align:middle line:84%
for example, gives health,
education, and welfare

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.370 align:middle line:84%
for the recipients
inside the nation,

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:13.010 align:middle line:90%
giving them maintenance.

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:14.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, think about it this way.

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Same as in the body
is in the nation.

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:19.430 align:middle line:84%
When we start to think
that we're threatened more

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:23.060 align:middle line:84%
from the outside, where
do we mobilize our energy?

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Adrenal system,
protection, defense.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, what does that
mean in the government?

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, we put our money into
the Department of Defense.

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:31.770 align:middle line:84%
More planes, more
army, and all that.

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but you put
this money into it,

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:36.820 align:middle line:84%
where did you get
the money from?

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, you had to take
it from something else.

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:40.395 align:middle line:90%
Guess where we take it from?

00:36:40.395 --> 00:36:44.270 align:middle line:84%
The Environmental Protection
Agency, education, welfare,

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.770 align:middle line:90%
health.

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:46.290 align:middle line:90%
That's called the immune system.

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:49.610 align:middle line:84%
So we suppress the immune
system by shorting the funding--

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:50.855 align:middle line:90%
>>There goes our vitality.

00:36:50.855 --> 00:36:53.901 align:middle line:84%
>>--and our vitality while
we're in a defense posture.

00:36:53.901 --> 00:36:55.650 align:middle line:84%
So the more we keep
throwing into defense,

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:57.880 align:middle line:84%
and the more we keep taking
away from the interior,

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.910 align:middle line:84%
there's a point where
people start to realize,

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:01.800 align:middle line:84%
you know, we're falling
apart on the inside,

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.633 align:middle line:84%
and the threats on the
outside aren't really

00:37:03.633 --> 00:37:04.740 align:middle line:90%
manifesting themselves.

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we should elect
a different president.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:07.310 align:middle line:90%
And then what do we do?

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have
another president who

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.590 align:middle line:90%
gets elected for what reason?

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:11.006 align:middle line:84%
Because he's going
to tell people,

00:37:11.006 --> 00:37:13.025 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
care you in home.

00:37:13.025 --> 00:37:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, the other guy says, I was
protecting you from the threat.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, it depends on where people
believe where the threats are.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.540 align:middle line:84%
If it's greater in the inside,
we elect that president,

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:22.040 align:middle line:90%
and what does he do?

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.420 align:middle line:84%
He takes the money
that was being

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.500 align:middle line:84%
put into the
Department of Defense

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:29.297 align:middle line:84%
and puts it back into social
services, welfare, EPA.

00:37:29.297 --> 00:37:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And so the reality
is then we build up

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.010 align:middle line:84%
the health of the country
until our next fear,

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and then we do this
back and forth.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.480 align:middle line:84%
In the human body,
it's interesting

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.739 align:middle line:84%
that when we get in
a defense posture

00:37:39.739 --> 00:37:41.530 align:middle line:84%
because our adrenal
glands are preparing us

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:45.290 align:middle line:84%
for fight or flight, the
very same hormones that

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:49.640 align:middle line:84%
fund the adrenal system and
get the energy into our arms

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.630 align:middle line:84%
and legs so we
can run and fight,

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:55.020 align:middle line:84%
the same hormones shut
off the immune system.

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And matter of fact, the medical
people use those hormones.

00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:00.080 align:middle line:84%
If I was going to graft
an organ into your body

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.470 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't want your
immune system to reject it,

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:04.770 align:middle line:84%
what they do and
what they've done

00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:07.870 align:middle line:84%
is they give the recipient
of the graft stress hormones.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is, in
the high stress hormones,

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:12.950 align:middle line:84%
it suppresses the immune
system and prevents

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:14.380 align:middle line:90%
a rejection of the graft.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.290 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but that's an
experimental situation.

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:18.039 align:middle line:84%
I want to know, what
about a normal person

00:38:18.039 --> 00:38:19.000 align:middle line:90%
having a normal day?

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And that is, when my adrenal
system is activated because I'm

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:25.410 align:middle line:84%
in threat or fear of
my life, I will then

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:27.750 align:middle line:84%
engage these hormones,
which will send blood

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:31.130 align:middle line:84%
to my arms and legs because
those are the structures I'm

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:33.040 align:middle line:90%
going to use to protect myself.

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.810 align:middle line:84%
But at the expense of removing
it from other systems,

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:37.860 align:middle line:84%
including the viscera,
which is growth,

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:41.320 align:middle line:84%
and the same hormones shut
down the immune system,

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.990 align:middle line:84%
so I don't put energy into
my Environmental Protection

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:45.990 align:middle line:90%
Agency, so to speak.

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:48.481 align:middle line:84%
As a result, then we
start to get sick.

00:38:48.481 --> 00:38:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
because people

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.130 align:middle line:84%
think, well, you
caught this illness.

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And what we now realize,
that's not true.

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Almost everyone, me,
you, everyone out there,

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:02.180 align:middle line:84%
is already infected with most of
the organisms that humans have.

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:04.281 align:middle line:84%
They're called
opportunistic organisms.

00:39:04.281 --> 00:39:05.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a wonderful name.

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:06.750 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:09.440 align:middle line:84%
You give them the opportunity,
they I'll take it.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.359 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't give
them the opportunity,

00:39:11.359 --> 00:39:13.900 align:middle line:84%
meaning if you're in a state of
harmony, health, and balance,

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and your immune system
is working at its normal

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.012 align:middle line:84%
functional level,
these organisms,

00:39:18.012 --> 00:39:19.470 align:middle line:84%
even though they're
in your blood--

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:22.370 align:middle line:84%
and I can take a blood sample
and show you got viruses

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:26.340 align:middle line:84%
and bacteria in there-- that
these organisms cannot grow

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:28.710 align:middle line:84%
when the immune system
is being funded.

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:31.220 align:middle line:84%
But the moment you pull the
funds out of the immune system

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:33.610 align:middle line:84%
because you're under
stress, these organisms

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:36.120 align:middle line:84%
take that opportunity
and start to flourish

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.470 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, we
start to express an illness.

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And the fact was, well, we
didn't just catch that illness.

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.800 align:middle line:90%
We already had it.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And yet, when we take away our
own self-defense mechanisms

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:49.770 align:middle line:84%
of the interior, then we
start to manifest them.

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:51.250 align:middle line:90%
What happens in our country?

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:53.050 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly the same thing.

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:56.400 align:middle line:84%
Our education system has gone
through the floor, it stinks.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Our health care system is one of
the lowest in the modern world,

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:03.270 align:middle line:90%
and in the first world.

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:06.290 align:middle line:84%
All the characteristics
of vitality, and survival,

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:08.222 align:middle line:84%
and prenatal health
care, and natal--

00:40:08.222 --> 00:40:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>>And infant mortality.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>-and infant mortality.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.980 align:middle line:84%
We're down to some very
surprisingly low levels.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.396 align:middle line:84%
>>And the issues about
that in our government,

00:40:15.396 --> 00:40:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and our maintenance
of ourselves.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.530 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:20.180 align:middle line:90%
Are we not prosperous?

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:20.680 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:22.870 align:middle line:84%
We're prosperous, but
where's the money going?

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Defense, military, aggression,
all these other things.

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:28.790 align:middle line:90%
And why is this a problem?

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Because nobody's taking care
of the population, the cells.

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>>And what are we
doing to ourselves

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:37.559 align:middle line:84%
in trying to keep up with the
engine that's been created,

00:40:37.559 --> 00:40:40.100 align:middle line:84%
the treadmill, so to speak, that
we've created for ourselves?

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:44.245 align:middle line:84%
We're downing three or four,
maybe, shots of espresso a day.

00:40:44.245 --> 00:40:45.620 align:middle line:84%
What is that doing,
in terms of--

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, that's where we go back
to the driver of the vehicle.

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:51.511 align:middle line:84%
If I want to keep my
vehicle going, and I realize

00:40:51.511 --> 00:40:52.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't have the energy.

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:53.176 align:middle line:90%
So what do I do?

00:40:53.176 --> 00:40:55.020 align:middle line:90%
I take a lot more caffeine.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.894 align:middle line:84%
Well, the fact is,
geez, you know,

00:40:56.894 --> 00:40:58.810 align:middle line:84%
you've already bypassed
the normal functioning

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:00.959 align:middle line:84%
of the system, because
where was the innate energy

00:41:00.959 --> 00:41:01.750 align:middle line:90%
you would have had?

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And the answer's, I'm
putting it into other things.

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:05.453 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm running
it off of caffeine.

00:41:05.453 --> 00:41:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's now chemically
interfering with the mechanism.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.172 align:middle line:84%
And then you wonder why, when
the mechanism is stressed,

00:41:11.172 --> 00:41:12.880 align:middle line:84%
and you wonder, well,
what's the problem?

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.480 align:middle line:84%
The answer is, if
you were running it

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.780 align:middle line:84%
in a holistic, normal,
healthy fashion,

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.150 align:middle line:84%
you would have had the energy
to run the system anyway.

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:21.500 align:middle line:84%
But if you're stressed,
and you're low on energy,

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.840 align:middle line:84%
then you start looking
for these outside things.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.380 align:middle line:90%
And so it's like a vehicle.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:29.250 align:middle line:84%
You could run the car on
methanol, you know, alcohol.

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:32.135 align:middle line:90%
Boy, dragsters race on that.

00:41:32.135 --> 00:41:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but you run your car on
that, it won't be very long

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:37.990 align:middle line:84%
and you'll burn that engine up
very quickly because it's not

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:40.620 align:middle line:90%
the normal nutrition for a car.

00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:44.015 align:middle line:84%
And our nutrition is off,
and our health is off,

00:41:44.015 --> 00:41:46.927 align:middle line:84%
and it's because
we're just not aware.

00:41:46.927 --> 00:41:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
because you say, well,

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.092 align:middle line:90%
why aren't we aware?

00:41:50.092 --> 00:41:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's unfortunate,
because you already

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.060 align:middle line:90%
brought up the problem.

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:54.860 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
pharmaceutical industry

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.290 align:middle line:84%
is not interested
in us being healthy.

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:59.650 align:middle line:84%
If we were healthy, they
wouldn't have a business.

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So propagating ill health
underneath the cover,

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:05.150 align:middle line:90%
pretense of healing us.

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>>But doctors are supposed
to know better, aren't they?

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I got to make a
real important point.

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And it is a real
important point, OK?

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:15.800 align:middle line:90%
And the point is this.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:20.360 align:middle line:84%
In the United States today,
the leading cause of death

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.850 align:middle line:90%
is medical intervention.

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:25.870 align:middle line:84%
It far exceeds cardiovascular
disease and cancer.

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:28.950 align:middle line:84%
It's some number
like 740,000 people

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:31.760 align:middle line:84%
die from getting
medical treatment.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.319 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of a
sudden, you say, oh.

00:42:33.319 --> 00:42:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>Which is a staggering number.

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>>It's a staggering number.

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.416 align:middle line:84%
So staggering that nobody
even talks about it.

00:42:37.416 --> 00:42:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Which to me is,
like, the omission

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:40.150 align:middle line:90%
of that is the big problem.

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.650 align:middle line:90%
>>Really.

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:42.983 align:middle line:84%
>>And the issue is, well then
there's a tendency to say,

00:42:42.983 --> 00:42:44.570 align:middle line:90%
oh, it's the medical doctor.

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say right now,
on anybody that's listening,

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.860 align:middle line:90%
that's medical bashing.

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
inappropriate and misdirected

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:54.150 align:middle line:90%
for this reason.

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Doctors practice to the
level they have been trained.

00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:01.220 align:middle line:84%
The issue is, it's the
training that's off.

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:03.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the academic
institutions that

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:05.980 align:middle line:84%
are teaching an old-fashioned,
outdated biology.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:09.450 align:middle line:84%
The biology of genes, and
victimization, and all that.

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:11.730 align:middle line:84%
The issues come from the
pharmaceutical industry

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:15.080 align:middle line:84%
which provides
post-graduate education.

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Don't doctors receive
some of their, what is it?

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:23.591 align:middle line:84%
Your continuing
education credentialing,

00:43:23.591 --> 00:43:25.340 align:middle line:84%
credential process
through drug companies?

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:26.923 align:middle line:84%
>>Through the
pharmaceutical industry.

00:43:26.923 --> 00:43:30.580 align:middle line:84%
So the reps go to the doctor and
give them, like, mini-courses.

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.560 align:middle line:84%
These drugs are good for
this, and these drugs

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:33.450 align:middle line:90%
are good for this.

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:35.075 align:middle line:84%
But now we find out,
you know, the reps

00:43:35.075 --> 00:43:37.400 align:middle line:84%
have been hyping a lot of
the drugs to sell the drugs,

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.550 align:middle line:84%
telling doctors to use
drugs that they're not

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:42.100 align:middle line:84%
even recommended,
the drugs are not

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:44.500 align:middle line:84%
recommended to even
use for these issues.

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:48.770 align:middle line:84%
So the point is, the doctors
practice as best as they can

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:51.050 align:middle line:84%
in the education
that they receive.

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:54.590 align:middle line:84%
If the education they
receive is lacking or failing

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:57.460 align:middle line:84%
in some degree, it
will manifest that

00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:59.730 align:middle line:84%
in the poor performance
of the doctor.

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:02.074 align:middle line:84%
Then we can turn around
and say, well, the doctors

00:44:02.074 --> 00:44:02.990 align:middle line:90%
are causing a problem.

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:05.220 align:middle line:90%
The answer is, no, they're not.

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.900 align:middle line:84%
They're doing the best
that they were trained.

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, the issue is, you want to
focus on where the problem is?

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Go back to the academic
institution, and especially

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:16.890 align:middle line:84%
the pharmaceutical
industry, because this

00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:18.850 align:middle line:84%
is where the money
comes from that

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:20.265 align:middle line:90%
says this is what you teach.

00:44:20.265 --> 00:44:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>>Will they fund the research?

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>They will not fund the
research on energy healing.

00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:25.990 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.180 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>And the reason is because if
I can heal myself with energy,

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:29.935 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to buy drugs.

00:44:29.935 --> 00:44:31.351 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm not
going to buy drugs,

00:44:31.351 --> 00:44:33.230 align:middle line:84%
then what do you think
this company that's

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:34.870 align:middle line:84%
making all this
money is going to do?

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>>I was privy, years
ago, doing a story

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:39.170 align:middle line:90%
for the news in my news days.

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And I was given access
that I probably should not

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:46.160 align:middle line:84%
have had to the
funding list for all

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.370 align:middle line:84%
the departments
and the projects.

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:52.465 align:middle line:84%
I was absolutely shocked to find
out the percentage of projects

00:44:52.465 --> 00:44:54.420 align:middle line:84%
that are funded by those
who have the greatest

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:56.630 align:middle line:84%
vested interest in the
outcome of the research.

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>This is why the
conversation we're

00:44:58.130 --> 00:44:59.740 align:middle line:90%
having is not on ABC and CBS.

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, yes.

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>>And the reason is
they get their money

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:03.584 align:middle line:84%
from the pharmaceutical
industry.

00:45:03.584 --> 00:45:06.420 align:middle line:84%
I saw Peter Jennings do a
show called "Bitter Medicine."

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And I saw, when he started
to show and he said,

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:13.500 align:middle line:84%
I want you to know that our
funding sponsors are mainly

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.430 align:middle line:84%
from the pharmaceutical industry
and that this influences

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:19.290 align:middle line:84%
the program that we're
going to talk about.

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And then goes in and does
talk about the atrocities

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.510 align:middle line:84%
that-- I call them
atrocities, anyway,

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:27.327 align:middle line:84%
because they're
knowingly interfering

00:45:27.327 --> 00:45:28.160 align:middle line:90%
with people's lives.

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.360 align:middle line:84%
These drug reps
and manufacturers

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:34.530 align:middle line:84%
are knowingly selling drugs
that in no way help people.

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the side
effects are more toxic,

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:39.400 align:middle line:84%
in a sense that-- here's
a statistic that's

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:45.580 align:middle line:84%
true-- 300,000, 300,000
people die every year

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:49.477 align:middle line:84%
from taking prescription drugs
because the drugs are toxic.

00:45:49.477 --> 00:45:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And the relevance about
that is, and they're

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:53.890 align:middle line:84%
talking about marijuana
smokers out there,

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:56.660 align:middle line:84%
and they're killing
300,000 people a year?

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's that old
magic show, look, pay

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.290 align:middle line:84%
attention to this over here and
don't look behind the curtain.

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:02.220 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is
it's going to have

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:06.680 align:middle line:90%
to change if we want to survive.

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is we have
to take responsibility

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:11.500 align:middle line:90%
for our own health.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.334 align:middle line:84%
And we cannot keep
putting it off,

00:46:13.334 --> 00:46:15.000 align:middle line:84%
that if there's
something wrong with me,

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.700 align:middle line:84%
somebody else is
going to fix it.

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:19.670 align:middle line:84%
That's an old belief system
based on a mechanistic approach

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:21.810 align:middle line:84%
that the body is
just this machine.

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:24.690 align:middle line:84%
The reality is, when we
put ourselves in as drivers

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:26.950 align:middle line:84%
and recognize how we drive
the vehicle determines

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:29.490 align:middle line:84%
the health of the vehicle,
I mean, a driver knows that.

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:32.520 align:middle line:84%
A person who really loves their
car takes care of that car.

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:37.550 align:middle line:84%
They put in the good nutrition,
the right gas, high quality

00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:38.957 align:middle line:90%
oil, all the lubricants.

00:46:38.957 --> 00:46:40.540 align:middle line:84%
They make sure they
put in good stuff.

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:41.380 align:middle line:90%
They love their car.

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:42.300 align:middle line:90%
They want it to run.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:44.280 align:middle line:84%
They take less
care of themselves.

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:48.200 align:middle line:84%
They put in worse nutrition,
and worse gas in their own body

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.350 align:middle line:90%
than they do in their car.

00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Their car will last
longer than they will.

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:52.400 align:middle line:90%
And what's the point?

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.400 align:middle line:84%
The point is, if you're
looking at that vehicle,

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and so concerned about that,
you could take that concern

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.720 align:middle line:90%
and put it into this vehicle.

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Because this vehicle, if
you start to run it right,

00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:04.350 align:middle line:84%
you eat well, get out of
all this processed food,

00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:07.720 align:middle line:84%
with all the chemicals
from the chemical industry,

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:10.630 align:middle line:84%
the same pharmaceutical
people, the drugs in the meat,

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:14.210 align:middle line:84%
and the food, all this
genetic engineering stuff.

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:17.530 align:middle line:84%
This is a disaster
in regard to what

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:20.100 align:middle line:90%
is normal, what we evolved with.

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Humans evolved using the
environment the way it was.

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:25.265 align:middle line:84%
Our distortion of
the environment,

00:47:25.265 --> 00:47:28.320 align:middle line:84%
it causes the
distortion of the human.

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And that we have to own
this, because as we destroy

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:32.810 align:middle line:84%
the environment,
we're actually going

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:36.740 align:middle line:84%
to have to own up to the fact
that we are that environment.

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And that that
environment reflects us.

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:40.310 align:middle line:90%
As the environments get worse--

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:42.018 align:middle line:84%
>>That's a train wreck
waiting to happen.

00:47:42.018 --> 00:47:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>>It's in the process
of already happening.

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:47.810 align:middle line:84%
You're killing 740,000 people a
year with a healing profession,

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:49.500 align:middle line:84%
then we ought to
stop right there.

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if that number
just got real enough,

00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:54.640 align:middle line:84%
that people just owned
it, it would stop.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:55.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, let's own it.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's say 740,000 people
are killed by this process.

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:03.200 align:middle line:84%
If it was, you know,
marijuana, 740,000,

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.390 align:middle line:84%
they'd have marijuana
police at every door,

00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:07.490 align:middle line:84%
arresting, and you
know, killing marijuana

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:09.060 align:middle line:90%
everywhere to get rid of it.

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:13.070 align:middle line:84%
740,000 people are dying
from the health industry.

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:15.060 align:middle line:84%
But they call that,
that's the risk of health.

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
that's a big enough risk

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.912 align:middle line:84%
that I don't think we want
to dabble in that area.

00:48:19.912 --> 00:48:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>>So now we're back to
the good news, bad news.

00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:22.571 align:middle line:90%
We can control--

00:48:22.571 --> 00:48:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>>--the quality of our life,
the quality of our health--

00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>>Et cetera, to a
very large extent.

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:31.476 align:middle line:84%
>>And yet, we have been
brainwashed into believing that

00:48:31.476 --> 00:48:32.100 align:middle line:90%
we don't have--

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>>That we're victims.

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>We're victims, and
we don't have the power

00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:36.988 align:middle line:84%
to really do-- do you really
want to go outside the system?

00:48:36.988 --> 00:48:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Because now you're up against
a disease that looks scary.

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And now, you've just told us it
is a little bit scary in that

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:47.770 align:middle line:84%
a lot of this programming is
in a part of our mind we're not

00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:49.440 align:middle line:90%
even aware of.

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:51.474 align:middle line:90%
Now, where do we go from here?

00:48:51.474 --> 00:48:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, where we have
to go through here

00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:55.490 align:middle line:84%
is to find out, A,
if we're running this

00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and we're driving this
vehicle, this life,

00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:00.870 align:middle line:84%
are we using good
driving skills?

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:04.350 align:middle line:90%
Do we have driving training?

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:06.990 align:middle line:84%
The training that is actually
detrimental to the survival

00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:09.820 align:middle line:84%
of the system, which, the truth
is, almost everybody does.

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And the point is, well,
can you retrain that?

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And the answer's of course you
can, and there are processes.

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, psychology,
when it was linked

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:20.320 align:middle line:84%
to the conventional
medical reality,

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:23.110 align:middle line:84%
looked at us as
biochemical machines.

00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Psychology used to
be trying to get

00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:27.470 align:middle line:84%
an understanding of the mind and
changing beliefs to fix health.

00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Psychology, well,
especially psychiatry,

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:31.940 align:middle line:84%
because it's more
medically-oriented,

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:34.060 align:middle line:84%
has even given up on that
and just said, oh, yeah it's

00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:35.620 align:middle line:84%
a chemical imbalance,
and that's what you need,

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:36.225 align:middle line:90%
is more chemistry.

00:49:36.225 --> 00:49:36.840 align:middle line:90%
>>More drugs.

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:37.406 align:middle line:90%
>>More drugs.

00:49:37.406 --> 00:49:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is, boy, I
would pull away from all these

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:41.650 align:middle line:84%
right away because
that's not the issue.

00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:43.340 align:middle line:84%
The issue is really
understanding

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.710 align:middle line:84%
the predominant control
of the subconscious, how

00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:49.490 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious was programmed
to give us life characters,

00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:52.640 align:middle line:84%
and training, and abilities to
fit into our world, how these

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:55.070 align:middle line:84%
were passed on to us
by parents who weren't

00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:57.300 align:middle line:84%
good drivers themselves,
so they're just

00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:00.200 align:middle line:84%
propagating the same bad
driving skills generation

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.770 align:middle line:84%
after generation, that we
are recipients of such skills

00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:04.980 align:middle line:90%
that are not supporting us.

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:08.310 align:middle line:84%
But there are ways through this
new form of psychology called

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:13.040 align:middle line:84%
energy psychology to actually
go back in and reprogram

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:16.110 align:middle line:84%
these fundamental beliefs,
identify which beliefs are you

00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:18.935 align:middle line:84%
carrying in your life today
that are not supporting you.

00:50:18.935 --> 00:50:19.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's the issue.

00:50:19.810 --> 00:50:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>And you partner
up with a person

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:23.910 align:middle line:84%
that does a beautiful
job of this.

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And you often present
together because you're

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:28.197 align:middle line:84%
two halves of the same
story, in essence.

00:50:28.197 --> 00:50:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>That was an exciting
thing because I

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:32.113 align:middle line:84%
used to end my lectures with
the thing as you just said.

00:50:32.113 --> 00:50:34.224 align:middle line:84%
Well, yup, your beliefs
are controlling this thing

00:50:34.224 --> 00:50:35.640 align:middle line:84%
and they're
destroying it as well.

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:37.014 align:middle line:84%
And then people
would immediately

00:50:37.014 --> 00:50:38.700 align:middle line:90%
say, what do I do about it?

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And I really didn't
have much answer,

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:43.390 align:middle line:84%
except my way when I did it,
because before I knew Rob,

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:44.900 align:middle line:90%
it was becoming mindful.

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:47.076 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhist concept
of mindfulness.

00:50:47.076 --> 00:50:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Don't let your
consciousness keep

00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:49.770 align:middle line:84%
being in the future
and the past.

00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:51.186 align:middle line:84%
Bring it to the
present and listen

00:50:51.186 --> 00:50:53.520 align:middle line:84%
to what your thoughts are,
and watch what you're doing.

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.580 align:middle line:90%
Is it supporting you or not?

00:50:55.580 --> 00:51:00.290 align:middle line:84%
But Rob Williams, my dear
friend, I met him years later,

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:02.945 align:middle line:84%
and he had developed one
of these energy psychology

00:51:02.945 --> 00:51:03.670 align:middle line:90%
processes.

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:04.840 align:middle line:90%
One of many different ones.

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:08.100 align:middle line:84%
I actually just like working
with Rob's because there's

00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:09.200 align:middle line:90%
an integrity issue.

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Rather than, in
his program, people

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:15.510 align:middle line:84%
trying to change other people,
that his program provides

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:18.780 align:middle line:84%
facilitators that allow a
person to change themselves.

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:21.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's not an outside person
telling you what you need.

00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:24.410 align:middle line:84%
The protocol really gets you
to get into your own belief

00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:26.810 align:middle line:84%
system, and your own
higher self to see

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:28.710 align:middle line:84%
what changes need
to be manifested.

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And so, I appreciate that
because an outside person

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:33.980 align:middle line:84%
is only giving you their
opinion of what's wrong.

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And you're the only
one that really knows.

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>>And this process
called Psych-K actually

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:43.610 align:middle line:84%
is an ability to identify those
programs that were installed

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:46.250 align:middle line:84%
into our subconscious when
we were less than six,

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:47.710 align:middle line:84%
these programs that
I said that are

00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:49.887 align:middle line:84%
the primary programs
of our lives,

00:51:49.887 --> 00:51:51.970 align:middle line:84%
to identify them even
though our consciousness has

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:53.200 align:middle line:90%
no identity of what they are.

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.783 align:middle line:84%
>>And we're going
to be talking to Rob

00:51:54.783 --> 00:51:57.480 align:middle line:84%
in just another few minutes
as a matter of fact.

00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you so much
for your time and energy.

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:02.130 align:middle line:84%
You're just an
incredible presenter.

00:52:02.130 --> 00:52:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Your information is
phenomenal, and to me, it's

00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:06.540 align:middle line:90%
really life-changing.

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:09.170 align:middle line:84%
It should be
Earth-changing information,

00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:11.872 align:middle line:84%
as I'm sure it is
becoming already.

00:52:11.872 --> 00:52:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm one of the
happy guys myself.

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:14.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm a student of it.

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:15.580 align:middle line:90%
I've learned my own self.

00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So to see that I went from
what my former life is

00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:21.424 align:middle line:84%
to my current life, it was
just changing awareness.

00:52:21.424 --> 00:52:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>>Big paradigm shift--

00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>--and that's what
we're ready for.

00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:23.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>Thank you for
this opportunity.

00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:27.790 align:middle line:90%


00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>If you find this
work intriguing,

00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:31.780 align:middle line:84%
you'll want to see the
interview with Rob Williams.

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Rob talks about
the practical end

00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:35.380 align:middle line:84%
of reprogramming
those subconscious

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:37.300 align:middle line:90%
beliefs that no longer serve us.

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, Bruce's book,
The Biology of Belief,

00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:43.010 align:middle line:84%
is a must-read for
anyone who chooses

00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:46.070 align:middle line:84%
to know how our bodies actually
respond to our environment.

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:47.910 align:middle line:84%
In spite of its roots
in the hard science

00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:51.770 align:middle line:84%
of cellular biology, it's very
readable and entertaining.

00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:53.680 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.

00:52:53.680 --> 00:53:05.667 align:middle line:90%
