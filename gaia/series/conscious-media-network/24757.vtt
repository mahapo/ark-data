00:00:00.587 --> 00:00:02.282
<v ->Alan Wallace was raised a Christian</v>

2
00:00:02.282 --> 00:00:04.085
in Pasadena, California,

3
00:00:04.085 --> 00:00:06.239
but something in him simply couldn't find

4
00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:08.085
a comfortable place in his world.

5
00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:10.890
As a young adult, he headed for India, not surprisingly,

6
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.396
learned to speak Tibetan with ease,

7
00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:15.487
and became a student of the Dalai Lama,

8
00:00:15.487 --> 00:00:18.313
a relationship that has lasted 37 years.

9
00:00:18.313 --> 00:00:21.310
During his years of deep seclusion and meditation,

10
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.852
Alan began writing on the essential truths about happiness,

11
00:00:24.852 --> 00:00:27.433
including the Buddhist belief that we are not

12
00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:29.592
entitled to happiness.

13
00:00:37.714 --> 00:00:39.901
You've spent many, many years of your life

14
00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:42.258
living in the Buddhist tradition.

15
00:00:42.258 --> 00:00:45.111
How did this originally happen for you?

16
00:00:47.442 --> 00:00:49.618
<v ->As I was growing up,</v>

17
00:00:49.618 --> 00:00:52.795
I was, on the one hand raised in a very religious household.

18
00:00:52.795 --> 00:00:55.046
My father's a theologian,

19
00:00:55.046 --> 00:00:58.278
and a lot of religion on both sides of my family tree.

20
00:00:58.278 --> 00:01:00.101
On the one hand.

21
00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:01.733
On the other hand, from a very early age,

22
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.696
age of 13, I was very strongly drawn

23
00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:05.264
to a career in science.

24
00:01:05.264 --> 00:01:06.906
Specifically in biology.

25
00:01:06.906 --> 00:01:10.341
And so as I was growing up, I just felt increasingly

26
00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:13.071
that the whole world view presented by modern science,

27
00:01:13.071 --> 00:01:15.791
especially with its materialistic underpinnings,

28
00:01:15.791 --> 00:01:18.756
was really fundamentally incompatible

29
00:01:18.756 --> 00:01:21.337
with the world view presented every Sunday.

30
00:01:21.337 --> 00:01:22.777
<v Interviewer>In church.</v>

31
00:01:22.777 --> 00:01:24.244
<v ->In church, exactly, yeah.</v>

32
00:01:24.244 --> 00:01:27.839
And I just didn't find anybody at all, frankly,

33
00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:31.604
who could unite these two worlds into one coherent whole,

34
00:01:31.604 --> 00:01:34.441
where the parts really fit in a meaningful

35
00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:36.170
and harmonious fashion.

36
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.358
So by the time I was 20, I'd really pretty well given up.

37
00:01:39.358 --> 00:01:41.619
I figured, "This society's not working for me,"

38
00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.464
because I couldn't, like many people can,

39
00:01:43.464 --> 00:01:46.568
I couldn't simply throw out religion lock, stock and barrel,

40
00:01:46.568 --> 00:01:47.955
like, "What a bunch of hooey.

41
00:01:47.955 --> 00:01:50.632
"What a bunch of nonsense and superstition."

42
00:01:50.632 --> 00:01:54.333
I think that is a rather primitive response

43
00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:57.810
to many of the most brilliant minds we've had

44
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.636
in the whole world, not only Western civilization,

45
00:02:00.636 --> 00:02:02.769
have been profoundly religious.

46
00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:04.007
<v Interviewer>But a common response</v>

47
00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:05.042
for people who are frustrated.

48
00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:06.301
<v ->Oh, it's very common.</v>

49
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:09.169
It's very common, but I think it's rather facile.

50
00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.057
I think it's rather facile.

51
00:02:11.057 --> 00:02:14.545
And that is these were not ninnies, you know?

52
00:02:14.545 --> 00:02:16.806
And to brush them off as if we in the 21st century

53
00:02:16.806 --> 00:02:19.419
somehow have such greater insight

54
00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:22.854
strikes me as just being

55
00:02:22.854 --> 00:02:24.731
not very self-critical.

56
00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:25.883
<v Interviewer>But do you think that perhaps</v>

57
00:02:25.883 --> 00:02:28.604
some of the later interpretations and translations

58
00:02:28.604 --> 00:02:30.438
could have been done by ninnies? (laughs)

59
00:02:30.438 --> 00:02:31.558
<v ->Oh, that's for sure,</v>

60
00:02:31.558 --> 00:02:33.948
and is there a lot of ninny-hood in religion?

61
00:02:33.948 --> 00:02:35.089
There's no question about it.

62
00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:38.118
Tomfoolery, idiotic thinking, superstition,

63
00:02:38.118 --> 00:02:39.782
there's no doubt about it,

64
00:02:39.782 --> 00:02:42.768
but to think that somehow science has discredited

65
00:02:42.768 --> 00:02:44.699
everything that comes under the guise of religion,

66
00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:46.811
including something that I've devoted

67
00:02:46.811 --> 00:02:48.229
a great deal of time to exploring,

68
00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:50.267
and that is the empirical elements,

69
00:02:50.267 --> 00:02:53.050
the profound experiential elements of religion.

70
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.098
Namely, contemplative inquiry.

71
00:02:55.098 --> 00:02:58.031
To somehow discount that as if that just...

72
00:02:58.031 --> 00:03:00.869
Whatever experiences arise from very deep,

73
00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:03.738
sometimes years on end, training

74
00:03:03.738 --> 00:03:06.170
to explore the nature of the mind, consciousness,

75
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.599
its origins and so forth,

76
00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:08.772
and to discount that,

77
00:03:08.772 --> 00:03:10.479
after all they're not scientists,

78
00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:12.409
strikes me as about as open minded as any

79
00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.670
religious fundamentalist I've ever met.

80
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.614
What I would call it is a kind of a methodolatry.

81
00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:19.523
That the scientific community, especially those working

82
00:03:19.523 --> 00:03:21.347
in the neurosciences, cognitive sciences,

83
00:03:21.347 --> 00:03:25.720
they're methodologies are, frankly, entirely materialistic.

84
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.195
They're trying to understand the mind

85
00:03:28.195 --> 00:03:31.117
exclusively by way of studying it indirectly,

86
00:03:31.117 --> 00:03:32.888
interrogating people, which is physical,

87
00:03:32.888 --> 00:03:34.722
you can record it.

88
00:03:34.722 --> 00:03:35.736
That's a physical act.

89
00:03:35.736 --> 00:03:37.176
<v Interviewer>Galvanic skin responses, all of it.</v>

90
00:03:37.176 --> 00:03:39.266
<v ->Galvanic skin response, EEG, studying behaviour,</v>

91
00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:41.696
studying fMRI and so forth.

92
00:03:41.696 --> 00:03:43.499
All of these are perfectly viable measures,

93
00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:45.046
and they're all materialistic,

94
00:03:45.046 --> 00:03:47.809
but when your methodology is 100% materialistic,

95
00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:50.229
it should go without saying that, of course,

96
00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.181
any conclusions you draw about the mind

97
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:53.621
will be materialistic.

98
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:55.199
Which is fair enough if that's

99
00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:56.607
what you're interested in doing,

100
00:03:56.607 --> 00:03:58.762
is adopting materialistic methodologies,

101
00:03:58.762 --> 00:04:02.047
knowing full well that you have no alternative

102
00:04:02.047 --> 00:04:04.713
but to draw materialistic conclusions.

103
00:04:04.713 --> 00:04:06.377
If that's what you'e interested in, why not?

104
00:04:06.377 --> 00:04:08.287
It's a free country, and I'm happy for such people,

105
00:04:08.287 --> 00:04:10.356
but then to turn around and say,

106
00:04:10.356 --> 00:04:12.062
"You see, all the evidence points

107
00:04:12.062 --> 00:04:13.875
"to the mind being material,"

108
00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:15.561
or a function of matter, I say,

109
00:04:15.561 --> 00:04:18.302
"Wait a minute, all the material you've garnered,

110
00:04:18.302 --> 00:04:20.115
"because all of your methodologies..."

111
00:04:20.115 --> 00:04:22.046
This is like a Christian trying to find

112
00:04:22.046 --> 00:04:23.827
evidence for God in the Bible.

113
00:04:23.827 --> 00:04:26.024
And then saying, "You see,

114
00:04:26.024 --> 00:04:28.447
"there's no evidence for atheism in the Bible."

115
00:04:28.447 --> 00:04:31.005
Well, if that's your only book,

116
00:04:31.005 --> 00:04:33.501
and that's the only source of authority,

117
00:04:33.501 --> 00:04:35.656
then one can say, "Duh."

118
00:04:35.656 --> 00:04:37.810
Likewise now, we have these modern scientists,

119
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.509
neurobiologists especially,

120
00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.594
their only book is the book of physical nature.

121
00:04:44.594 --> 00:04:46.055
It's the only one they ever study,

122
00:04:46.055 --> 00:04:48.391
it's the only book they have any means of reading,

123
00:04:48.391 --> 00:04:50.386
because all of their technologies, all their methodologies

124
00:04:50.386 --> 00:04:52.967
are good for that and good for nothing else.

125
00:04:52.967 --> 00:04:56.017
But then one can say there isn't anything else.

126
00:04:56.017 --> 00:04:58.673
And I would say, "Yes, there is."

127
00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:02.043
Just as there is a way of studying the stars and planets,

128
00:05:02.043 --> 00:05:06.299
apart from studying old books on astrology and so forth.

129
00:05:06.299 --> 00:05:09.744
The way to understand the nature of the origins and so forth

130
00:05:09.744 --> 00:05:13.445
of stars, planets, galaxies, sun and moon, planet Earth,

131
00:05:13.445 --> 00:05:17.755
is, low and behold, observe very closely.

132
00:05:17.755 --> 00:05:19.109
<v Interviewer>Observation, absolutely.</v>

133
00:05:19.109 --> 00:05:21.125
<v ->Observe the phenomena you're trying to understand.</v>

134
00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:23.279
And here we have the mind, states of consciousness,

135
00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:24.517
mental phenomena,

136
00:05:24.517 --> 00:05:26.384
arising from moment to moment to moment.

137
00:05:26.384 --> 00:05:28.719
Using all the instruments of technology,

138
00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:30.874
you can never observe a single mental event.

139
00:05:30.874 --> 00:05:32.623
Not one.

140
00:05:32.623 --> 00:05:34.937
Not even if you had pain in your knee right now.

141
00:05:34.937 --> 00:05:36.441
I mean, that's a pretty primitive kind of thing.

142
00:05:36.441 --> 00:05:37.646
My knee hurts.

143
00:05:37.646 --> 00:05:39.576
Is there any instrument of technology

144
00:05:39.576 --> 00:05:41.945
that can tell us definitively are you lying,

145
00:05:41.945 --> 00:05:43.577
are you telling the truth?

146
00:05:43.577 --> 00:05:45.123
There is no such instrument.

147
00:05:45.123 --> 00:05:48.447
You can find brain events

148
00:05:48.447 --> 00:05:50.970
that are more or less correlated with pain,

149
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.655
but can we say definitively,

150
00:05:52.655 --> 00:05:54.629
from an objective, scientific perspective,

151
00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:56.516
you're lying or you're telling the truth

152
00:05:56.516 --> 00:05:58.084
when you say you have pain in your knee?

153
00:05:58.084 --> 00:05:59.908
And the answer is we don't know.

154
00:05:59.908 --> 00:06:02.148
And so all of these objectively experienced mental events

155
00:06:02.148 --> 00:06:04.505
are invisible to all the means of technology.

156
00:06:04.505 --> 00:06:06.030
<v Interviewer>And yet our entire life experience</v>

157
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.220
is comprised of nothing but these beliefs and perceptions.

158
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.086
<v ->Precisely, precisely.</v>

159
00:06:11.086 --> 00:06:13.358
And, moreover, it is is possible,

160
00:06:13.358 --> 00:06:15.193
and the great contemplative traditions of the world

161
00:06:15.193 --> 00:06:16.920
have been doing this for millennia,

162
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.110
it is possible not only to take a casual glance,

163
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.424
introspectively, and observe one's thoughts and so forth,

164
00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:24.515
rather like folk astronomy,

165
00:06:24.515 --> 00:06:26.850
leaving us at the level of folk psychology,

166
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.069
but it's also, with rigorous training

167
00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:31.608
that sometimes takes years to master,

168
00:06:31.608 --> 00:06:34.733
it is possible to develop a telescope of the mind.

169
00:06:34.733 --> 00:06:36.993
That is, develop very refined attention

170
00:06:36.993 --> 00:06:38.530
that is stable, that is clear,

171
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.908
enhance your metacognitive abilities,

172
00:06:40.908 --> 00:06:43.201
your ability to monitor your own states of consciousness,

173
00:06:43.201 --> 00:06:46.636
and being probing into the deep space of the mind.

174
00:06:46.636 --> 00:06:49.398
Now, this is a truly scientific approach

175
00:06:49.398 --> 00:06:50.646
to the study of the mind,

176
00:06:50.646 --> 00:06:52.246
in the same way that Galileo's approach

177
00:06:52.246 --> 00:06:54.059
to studying the stars and planets and so forth

178
00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:56.715
was truly scientific, it was empirical.

179
00:06:56.715 --> 00:06:58.827
This is a truly empirical and

180
00:06:58.827 --> 00:07:03.275
it is an avenue of inquiry that's completely been neglected,

181
00:07:03.275 --> 00:07:05.227
and I mean 100% neglected,

182
00:07:05.227 --> 00:07:08.320
by all major institutions of the academy,

183
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.730
of scientific institutions and so forth,

184
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.514
of honing the ability to observe the mind.

185
00:07:13.514 --> 00:07:15.349
So I'm gonna come back to your earlier question.

186
00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:17.321
What got me into this,

187
00:07:17.321 --> 00:07:19.669
the initial question, you might recall,

188
00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:22.580
is that I felt there was really something

189
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.106
to the mind and consciousness,

190
00:07:24.106 --> 00:07:26.281
but I also felt that nothing in my background,

191
00:07:26.281 --> 00:07:28.744
I'd studied biology, various branches of science

192
00:07:28.744 --> 00:07:31.229
and so forth, I thought nothing was getting to it.

193
00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:33.607
Back then, in 1970, they were studying rats and pigeons.

194
00:07:33.607 --> 00:07:35.251
It was primarily behavioural,

195
00:07:35.251 --> 00:07:36.797
and really, let's get real,

196
00:07:36.797 --> 00:07:39.389
how much would I ever learn about your emotional life,

197
00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:40.839
if I'm interested in your mind--

198
00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:42.258
<v Interviewer>Through my pet rat?</v>

199
00:07:42.258 --> 00:07:44.434
<v ->Look at your rat, and give it some crumbs,</v>

200
00:07:44.434 --> 00:07:45.511
and see how many times it will

201
00:07:45.511 --> 00:07:46.684
run through a hoop or something.

202
00:07:46.684 --> 00:07:49.372
I mean, it's really rather bizarre, right?

203
00:07:49.372 --> 00:07:52.177
So I felt here's an area,

204
00:07:52.177 --> 00:07:54.567
the nature of the human, if we use a theological term,

205
00:07:54.567 --> 00:07:56.220
the human soul, the human spirit,

206
00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.673
human identity, human mind, consciousness.

207
00:07:58.673 --> 00:07:59.910
What is it?

208
00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:01.766
We are somehow conscious.

209
00:08:01.766 --> 00:08:03.675
Isn't this a wondrous event?

210
00:08:03.675 --> 00:08:05.275
And what is the nature of this?

211
00:08:05.275 --> 00:08:09.403
So I wasn't finding it in your mainstream religion.

212
00:08:09.403 --> 00:08:11.334
We know what that's about,

213
00:08:11.334 --> 00:08:13.488
and the contemplative practice basically isn't there.

214
00:08:13.488 --> 00:08:16.901
Very, very rare, back then it was almost non-existent.

215
00:08:16.901 --> 00:08:19.440
Nowhere in psychology or biology, neuroscience,

216
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.082
nowhere to be found.

217
00:08:21.082 --> 00:08:23.418
So I was just basically utterly disenchanted.

218
00:08:23.418 --> 00:08:25.391
I was disenchanted.

219
00:08:25.391 --> 00:08:27.013
<v Interviewer>Is that when you packed your bags for India?</v>

220
00:08:27.013 --> 00:08:27.994
<v ->Precisely.</v>

221
00:08:27.994 --> 00:08:29.348
Well, I packed my bags first if all

222
00:08:29.348 --> 00:08:31.300
just to get out without my parents

223
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.210
going completely ballistic.

224
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.076
I decided, "I'm getting out of here,

225
00:08:35.076 --> 00:08:36.974
"and I'm going to try to do in a legal way,

226
00:08:36.974 --> 00:08:38.457
"or an acceptable way."

227
00:08:38.457 --> 00:08:41.945
So I took my junior year abroad,

228
00:08:41.945 --> 00:08:44.505
that was one of the options at the University of California,

229
00:08:44.505 --> 00:08:46.190
and I went off to Germany.

230
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.771
I was raised partly in Switzerland, I was fluent in German.

231
00:08:48.771 --> 00:08:51.310
I said, "That'll get me out of here, anyway."

232
00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.430
But I was really a seeker.

233
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.414
I mean, I was kind of really classic for my era.

234
00:08:56.414 --> 00:08:59.604
This was 1970, and I was just seeking.

235
00:08:59.604 --> 00:09:02.003
I had existential questions, spiritual questions,

236
00:09:02.003 --> 00:09:04.681
but I wasn't willing to discard either

237
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:06.920
religion or science.

238
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.374
I just felt there's too much depth, too much insight,

239
00:09:09.374 --> 00:09:10.642
in both of these areas.

240
00:09:10.642 --> 00:09:12.712
While there's an enormous amount of dogmatism

241
00:09:12.712 --> 00:09:14.152
in modern science...

242
00:09:14.152 --> 00:09:17.244
I mean, there's absolutely uncritical, unquestioning

243
00:09:17.244 --> 00:09:22.211
absolute non-skeptical embrace of materialism.

244
00:09:22.211 --> 00:09:24.813
Everything has to be boiled down to matter,

245
00:09:24.813 --> 00:09:26.498
which I find, frankly, laughable.

246
00:09:26.498 --> 00:09:27.906
I mean, matter is a human construct.

247
00:09:27.906 --> 00:09:31.158
We didn't discover it, we defined it, you know?

248
00:09:31.158 --> 00:09:33.004
So for us to define a category,

249
00:09:33.004 --> 00:09:34.850
and, frankly, we are the only ones that defined it.

250
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.087
Not nature.

251
00:09:36.087 --> 00:09:37.782
If nature defined it, we would have simply discovered it

252
00:09:37.782 --> 00:09:39.201
a long time and stuck with it.

253
00:09:39.201 --> 00:09:41.292
But the very category of matter has shifted over the last

254
00:09:41.292 --> 00:09:44.566
at least 400 years, since Copernicus.

255
00:09:44.566 --> 00:09:46.944
So here we've created our own category,

256
00:09:46.944 --> 00:09:48.747
which is a human construct,

257
00:09:48.747 --> 00:09:50.944
and now say the entire universe,

258
00:09:50.944 --> 00:09:55.211
13.7 billion years, with maybe 50 to 100 billion galaxies,

259
00:09:55.211 --> 00:09:57.621
all fits into a construct that we here on planet Earth

260
00:09:57.621 --> 00:10:00.309
have devised over the last century or so.

261
00:10:00.309 --> 00:10:02.912
I think give me a break, you know?

262
00:10:02.912 --> 00:10:05.269
Is this ontological pomposity or what?

263
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:07.583
I just don't get it, but then of course,

264
00:10:07.583 --> 00:10:09.556
there are religious fundamentalists of all sorts,

265
00:10:09.556 --> 00:10:12.372
that feel all of reality fits into our book.

266
00:10:12.372 --> 00:10:15.764
You name the book, but everything important is here,

267
00:10:15.764 --> 00:10:18.527
and these materialists have the book of physical nature

268
00:10:18.527 --> 00:10:20.873
with their categories of the so-called natural,

269
00:10:20.873 --> 00:10:23.444
which they've defined, the physical, which they've defined,

270
00:10:23.444 --> 00:10:25.054
the material, which they define,

271
00:10:25.054 --> 00:10:27.348
and they say all of reality has to fit into this.

272
00:10:27.348 --> 00:10:29.011
I just find that very quaint.

273
00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:32.333
<v Interviewer>So you then, at some point, obviously,</v>

274
00:10:32.333 --> 00:10:33.491
took off from Germany,

275
00:10:33.491 --> 00:10:35.240
and you headed for...

276
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.689
Did you go to Dharamsala first?

277
00:10:36.689 --> 00:10:39.248
<v ->I did a bee line to Dharamsala,</v>

278
00:10:39.248 --> 00:10:42.256
but I had an agenda first, when I was in Germany.

279
00:10:42.256 --> 00:10:45.691
I went to the University of Göttingen for one year.

280
00:10:45.691 --> 00:10:48.229
Before arriving there I was hitchhiking around Europe

281
00:10:48.229 --> 00:10:49.733
for about two months,

282
00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:51.194
and there I was a seeker,

283
00:10:51.194 --> 00:10:53.285
really very searing, very pressing,

284
00:10:53.285 --> 00:10:55.013
urgent questions in my mind.

285
00:10:55.013 --> 00:10:58.159
I was up at a youth hostel up in the Swiss Alps,

286
00:10:58.159 --> 00:11:00.292
where I'd been raised near there,

287
00:11:00.292 --> 00:11:01.530
a number of times, couple of times,

288
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.215
as a small child and an adolescent.

289
00:11:03.215 --> 00:11:04.910
And somebody had left behind a book

290
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:08.132
on the nature of awareness according to Tibetan Buddhism.

291
00:11:08.132 --> 00:11:10.799
Left behind it, clearly had been abandoned.

292
00:11:10.799 --> 00:11:11.790
<v Interviewer>A gift?</v>

293
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:12.665
<v ->It was a gift.</v>

294
00:11:12.665 --> 00:11:13.881
So I figured, "Boy, that's got my name on it,"

295
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:16.483
and I started reading it, and it was like a...

296
00:11:18.373 --> 00:11:19.818
Like bells going off.

297
00:11:19.818 --> 00:11:22.047
This is it, this is it, this is it.

298
00:11:22.047 --> 00:11:24.202
And so I continued hitch hiking around,

299
00:11:24.202 --> 00:11:27.455
hitch hiking up in Norway,

300
00:11:27.455 --> 00:11:29.610
and really thinking I must find a wise old man,

301
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:30.580
I need some guidance.

302
00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.553
Buddhism is the way, but now where's a man?

303
00:11:32.553 --> 00:11:33.855
I need to meet somebody.

304
00:11:33.855 --> 00:11:36.937
And in my 20 year old mind,

305
00:11:36.937 --> 00:11:38.708
I thought it should be a wise old man.

306
00:11:38.708 --> 00:11:40.190
You know, the archetype.

307
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.374
And, lo and behold, I was out there

308
00:11:41.374 --> 00:11:44.190
hitch hiking between Bergen and Oslo up in Norway

309
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.102
and an old man picked me up in his VW Bug.

310
00:11:47.102 --> 00:11:50.067
It turned out he was a Buddhist monk who lived in Nepal,

311
00:11:50.067 --> 00:11:51.848
and he gave me just the guidance I needed.

312
00:11:51.848 --> 00:11:53.949
I went down to Germany and basically dropped

313
00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:57.277
all the courses that I had intended to study or take,

314
00:11:57.277 --> 00:11:59.976
and immediately, on great big hunch,

315
00:11:59.976 --> 00:12:01.704
basically betting my life,

316
00:12:01.704 --> 00:12:03.677
I started studying Tibetan language.

317
00:12:03.677 --> 00:12:04.893
There was a Tibetan Lama there,

318
00:12:04.893 --> 00:12:06.215
appointed by the Dalai Lama.

319
00:12:06.215 --> 00:12:07.634
I became his only student,

320
00:12:07.634 --> 00:12:09.490
and then read voraciously

321
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.092
of the contemplative traditions of the world.

322
00:12:12.092 --> 00:12:14.428
Zen Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity,

323
00:12:14.428 --> 00:12:16.155
anything I could get my hands on,

324
00:12:16.155 --> 00:12:17.820
because I had a question.

325
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.804
I was reading up to eight hours a day,

326
00:12:19.804 --> 00:12:22.022
this was a, "I've got to get clear on this."

327
00:12:22.022 --> 00:12:24.380
And that is not on a doctrinal level,

328
00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.171
the institutional level, the political level.

329
00:12:26.171 --> 00:12:28.219
World religions differ all over the place,

330
00:12:28.219 --> 00:12:30.374
in very significant ways, but when we go to

331
00:12:30.374 --> 00:12:32.464
the depths of contemplative insight,

332
00:12:32.464 --> 00:12:34.331
in the Christian, the Buddhist, and so on,

333
00:12:34.331 --> 00:12:36.613
do they converge, or do they diverge,

334
00:12:36.613 --> 00:12:38.928
or are they simply unrelated to each other?

335
00:12:38.928 --> 00:12:41.018
Like, I don't know, fish and apricots.

336
00:12:41.018 --> 00:12:42.842
Just there, you know?

337
00:12:42.842 --> 00:12:45.712
Because I felt that was almost like a geometrical design.

338
00:12:45.712 --> 00:12:47.097
Are they going like this,

339
00:12:47.097 --> 00:12:48.153
are they going like this,

340
00:12:48.153 --> 00:12:49.594
or are they just going like this?

341
00:12:49.594 --> 00:12:53.796
I felt if they diverge, or are just unrelated to each other,

342
00:12:53.796 --> 00:12:57.391
then why should I give credence to any of them?

343
00:12:57.391 --> 00:12:59.929
They're probably just, meditation is probably just

344
00:12:59.929 --> 00:13:03.524
a way of brainwashing yourself to believe or to experience

345
00:13:03.524 --> 00:13:06.798
what you've already taught yourself to believe.

346
00:13:06.798 --> 00:13:08.205
In which case, who cares?

347
00:13:08.205 --> 00:13:09.689
I'll find something else to do.

348
00:13:09.689 --> 00:13:11.630
But if, at the deepest level,

349
00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:13.134
where they seem to be, some of them,

350
00:13:13.134 --> 00:13:15.491
seem to be transcending their own doctrines

351
00:13:15.491 --> 00:13:18.051
and going to an immediacy of experience

352
00:13:18.051 --> 00:13:20.151
that transcends concepts, words, and so forth,

353
00:13:20.151 --> 00:13:22.872
if there appeared to be a profound convergence there,

354
00:13:22.872 --> 00:13:26.648
then my big hunch, that I was willing to bet my life on,

355
00:13:26.648 --> 00:13:29.517
was they're probably converging on the most important truths

356
00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:32.034
human beings have ever encountered.

357
00:13:32.034 --> 00:13:34.082
And that's worth devoting a whole life to.

358
00:13:34.082 --> 00:13:36.236
After a year of study, reading voraciously,

359
00:13:36.236 --> 00:13:37.538
thinking, meditating,

360
00:13:37.538 --> 00:13:39.425
I came to the conclusion,

361
00:13:39.425 --> 00:13:41.537
obviously I didn't know, but

362
00:13:41.537 --> 00:13:43.511
this is going to be my working hypothesis:

363
00:13:43.511 --> 00:13:45.356
there's a profound convergence here.

364
00:13:45.356 --> 00:13:46.636
These are the most important truths

365
00:13:46.636 --> 00:13:49.665
we can ever access, and this is all I want to do.

366
00:13:49.665 --> 00:13:52.065
And a place to go now, since I knew my path

367
00:13:52.065 --> 00:13:53.462
was Tibetan Buddhism.

368
00:13:53.462 --> 00:13:55.542
It just had my name marked on it in some ways.

369
00:13:55.542 --> 00:13:57.728
Then, at the age of 21, after a year in Germany,

370
00:13:57.728 --> 00:13:59.254
I bought myself a one way ticket,

371
00:13:59.254 --> 00:14:02.443
sold or gave away everything I couldn't carry on my back,

372
00:14:02.443 --> 00:14:04.053
and sold my whole camera.

373
00:14:04.053 --> 00:14:06.261
I was rather serious about photography.

374
00:14:06.261 --> 00:14:09.152
Sold all my camera gear to buy a one way ticket to India.

375
00:14:09.152 --> 00:14:12.010
Flew to Bombay, flew from Bombay to Delhi,

376
00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:13.514
got the first train to Pathankot,

377
00:14:13.514 --> 00:14:16.074
got the first bus to Dharamsala,

378
00:14:16.074 --> 00:14:18.314
and I plunked myself down for four years.

379
00:14:18.314 --> 00:14:19.839
<v Interviewer>And during that time,</v>

380
00:14:19.839 --> 00:14:22.111
was that when you met your teacher?

381
00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:25.300
<v ->Yeah, it was.</v>

382
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.222
My teacher in Germany was primarily a language teacher.

383
00:14:28.222 --> 00:14:30.889
<v Interviewer>The one you write about, Kungo Barshi?</v>

384
00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:32.755
<v ->Oh, Kungo Barshi, Kungo Barshi.</v>

385
00:14:32.755 --> 00:14:34.813
He was one of my many teachers, a very dear...

386
00:14:34.813 --> 00:14:36.905
He's still alive, I'm happy to say.

387
00:14:36.905 --> 00:14:39.198
He was one of my many teachers.

388
00:14:39.198 --> 00:14:42.590
What brought me to Dharamsala was,

389
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:45.799
I was actually living in a monastery in Switzerland

390
00:14:45.799 --> 00:14:47.347
for a couple of months, for a summer,

391
00:14:47.347 --> 00:14:49.790
actually planning to go to Nepal,

392
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:53.107
because I was imagining I'd find some yogi in a cave,

393
00:14:53.107 --> 00:14:55.294
and I'd become his chela, his disciple,

394
00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:58.493
and I would become enlightened quite quickly.

395
00:14:58.493 --> 00:15:00.253
That was the idea.

396
00:15:00.253 --> 00:15:02.067
I had no interest in academia at all,

397
00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:03.826
I was pretty much burnt out of academia.

398
00:15:03.826 --> 00:15:05.725
It was sterile, dry, didn't go anywhere.

399
00:15:05.725 --> 00:15:08.893
Give me a break, I want to find a yogi.

400
00:15:08.893 --> 00:15:11.677
So I was in this monastery in northern Switzerland,

401
00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:13.428
a little town called Rikon,

402
00:15:13.428 --> 00:15:16.082
and a bulletin arrived from India, from Dharamsala,

403
00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:18.642
saying that just about a month after

404
00:15:18.642 --> 00:15:22.748
I was planning to go to Asia, the fall of 1971,

405
00:15:22.748 --> 00:15:25.329
the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives would be opened

406
00:15:25.329 --> 00:15:27.345
under the auspices of the Dalai Lama

407
00:15:27.345 --> 00:15:29.734
and a one year class would be held for Westerners

408
00:15:29.734 --> 00:15:31.867
who are seriously interested in studying Buddhism.

409
00:15:31.867 --> 00:15:34.449
The Lama that I was studying with in Switzerland

410
00:15:34.449 --> 00:15:37.435
said, "Alan, forget about Nepal.

411
00:15:37.435 --> 00:15:40.059
"You should go here, this is directly under the Dalai Lama.

412
00:15:40.059 --> 00:15:41.563
"You should go there."

413
00:15:41.563 --> 00:15:43.611
So I said, "Okay, whatever."

414
00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:45.563
You know, I had at least enough humility

415
00:15:45.563 --> 00:15:46.992
to listen to what he said.

416
00:15:46.992 --> 00:15:48.837
So I made a bee line for Dharamsala,

417
00:15:48.837 --> 00:15:50.864
and there was a marvellous Tibetan Lama there,

418
00:15:50.864 --> 00:15:52.186
appointed by the Dalai Lama,

419
00:15:52.186 --> 00:15:54.671
so he became my first Lama or teacher

420
00:15:54.671 --> 00:15:56.133
who really taught me a lot.

421
00:15:56.133 --> 00:15:57.306
In the same institute,

422
00:15:57.306 --> 00:15:59.076
this Library of Tibetan Works and Archives,

423
00:15:59.076 --> 00:16:00.900
was this wonderful man Kungo.

424
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.279
He became my Tibetan language teacher,

425
00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:04.847
and then very rapidly,

426
00:16:04.847 --> 00:16:06.425
within a couple of months of my being there,

427
00:16:06.425 --> 00:16:10.393
I met with His Holiness, the Dalai Lama,

428
00:16:10.393 --> 00:16:12.686
and he's really been my principal teacher, mentor,

429
00:16:12.686 --> 00:16:13.987
ever since then.

430
00:16:13.987 --> 00:16:15.225
So that was 37 years ago.

431
00:16:15.225 --> 00:16:17.241
<v Interviewer>37 years.</v>

432
00:16:17.241 --> 00:16:22.051
Let's start talking about some of what you consider to be

433
00:16:22.051 --> 00:16:24.227
the most essential truths,

434
00:16:24.227 --> 00:16:27.576
and let's talk about the notion of happiness

435
00:16:27.576 --> 00:16:30.564
or a life well lived, since we're at a conference

436
00:16:30.564 --> 00:16:32.793
studying the nature of happiness.

437
00:16:32.793 --> 00:16:35.886
The word in Tibetan is sukha, is that correct?

438
00:16:35.886 --> 00:16:37.038
<v ->That's actually Sanskrit.</v>

439
00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:39.013
Sanskrit is sukha, yeah.

440
00:16:39.013 --> 00:16:42.307
The Sanskrit is usually a bit easier to pronounce

441
00:16:42.307 --> 00:16:44.846
for us Americans than Tibetan,

442
00:16:44.846 --> 00:16:46.936
because Sanskrit is an Indo-European language,

443
00:16:46.936 --> 00:16:48.942
so it's got a nice alphabet, and you look at it

444
00:16:48.942 --> 00:16:50.328
and you can read it,

445
00:16:50.328 --> 00:16:54.061
because it sounds like what it looks like.

446
00:16:54.061 --> 00:16:55.970
<v Interviewer>Right, let's talk about that.</v>

447
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.552
The essential truths that you started seeing intersecting,

448
00:16:58.552 --> 00:17:01.729
as you said, at the inverted pyramid there,

449
00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:03.799
at the bottom of the V,

450
00:17:03.799 --> 00:17:07.308
and what those were, how these truths started evolving

451
00:17:07.308 --> 00:17:09.367
to the surface and the nature

452
00:17:09.367 --> 00:17:11.863
of the study of happiness and that endeavour.

453
00:17:11.863 --> 00:17:14.113
<v ->Well, in Western religions,</v>

454
00:17:14.113 --> 00:17:16.375
or, let's say, call them the Abrahamic religions

455
00:17:16.375 --> 00:17:18.444
of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam,

456
00:17:18.444 --> 00:17:22.145
these are really classic, paradigmatic religions.

457
00:17:22.145 --> 00:17:24.544
I think our very notion of what a religion is,

458
00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:26.913
into which we then throw Daoism and Hinduism

459
00:17:26.913 --> 00:17:28.523
and Buddhism and so forth,

460
00:17:28.523 --> 00:17:30.955
but really this category, just, once again, as matter,

461
00:17:30.955 --> 00:17:35.083
energy are categories that human beings have created,

462
00:17:35.083 --> 00:17:36.139
never discovered.

463
00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:37.301
We've defined them.

464
00:17:37.301 --> 00:17:39.488
In a similar fashion, we didn't discover religion.

465
00:17:39.488 --> 00:17:41.440
We human beings, we in the West,

466
00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.149
have defined religion according to our constructs,

467
00:17:44.149 --> 00:17:45.749
our framework,

468
00:17:45.749 --> 00:17:47.722
and it's really overwhelmingly defined by the

469
00:17:47.722 --> 00:17:50.506
salient characteristics of the Abrahamic religions.

470
00:17:50.506 --> 00:17:53.183
They start out, I think without exception, really,

471
00:17:53.183 --> 00:17:56.297
with very deep ontological or metaphysical claims

472
00:17:56.297 --> 00:18:00.595
that we cannot readily test by experience.

473
00:18:00.595 --> 00:18:02.366
In the beginning, God created.

474
00:18:02.366 --> 00:18:04.819
In the beginning was the word, the word was made flesh.

475
00:18:04.819 --> 00:18:09.437
There is but one God, and Muhammed is his prophet.

476
00:18:09.437 --> 00:18:12.744
Well, those may be true claims,

477
00:18:12.744 --> 00:18:15.058
but how on earth do we know?

478
00:18:15.058 --> 00:18:16.136
And how on earth do we ever put that

479
00:18:16.136 --> 00:18:18.151
to the test of experience, right?

480
00:18:18.151 --> 00:18:21.543
Buddhism radically doesn't start out that way,

481
00:18:21.543 --> 00:18:24.018
and so, really, what it is worthwhile asking

482
00:18:24.018 --> 00:18:29.018
is it appropriate, is it revealing or more obscuring,

483
00:18:29.289 --> 00:18:32.317
to simply dump Buddhism into the category of religion

484
00:18:32.317 --> 00:18:33.651
that's already been defined

485
00:18:33.651 --> 00:18:36.051
according to three Western religions.

486
00:18:36.051 --> 00:18:37.736
Buddhism doesn't start there.

487
00:18:37.736 --> 00:18:40.339
And I must say it was not because of the deepest claims,

488
00:18:40.339 --> 00:18:43.506
the ultimate nature of awareness or these kind of claims,

489
00:18:43.506 --> 00:18:47.592
that really held me, gripped me, and then inspired me

490
00:18:47.592 --> 00:18:50.514
to want to go deeper and deeper and deeper.

491
00:18:50.514 --> 00:18:52.893
Rather, Buddhism starts with experience.

492
00:18:52.893 --> 00:18:54.983
Experience right now, here and now,

493
00:18:54.983 --> 00:18:57.116
not what happened long ago in the universe,

494
00:18:57.116 --> 00:19:00.391
or what's the ultimate dimension of consciousness,

495
00:19:00.391 --> 00:19:04.103
which of course we can't easily fathom either.

496
00:19:04.103 --> 00:19:06.097
It starts out with here, there's a reality of

497
00:19:06.097 --> 00:19:07.622
let's call it dissatisfaction.

498
00:19:07.622 --> 00:19:09.148
There's that word dukkha.

499
00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:12.518
The dissatisfaction goes from boredom, malaise...

500
00:19:12.518 --> 00:19:13.809
<v Interviewer>The opposite of sukha.</v>

501
00:19:13.809 --> 00:19:14.992
<v ->It's the opposite of sukha,</v>

502
00:19:14.992 --> 00:19:16.774
but it covers a whole bandwidth here.

503
00:19:16.774 --> 00:19:20.411
If you have a little itch on your kneecap.

504
00:19:20.411 --> 00:19:22.181
Oh, that itches, I don't like that.

505
00:19:22.181 --> 00:19:23.419
That would be dukkha.

506
00:19:23.419 --> 00:19:24.805
I don't like it.

507
00:19:24.805 --> 00:19:26.245
That's pretty trivial.

508
00:19:26.245 --> 00:19:29.498
All the way to anguish, to physical torment,

509
00:19:29.498 --> 00:19:31.589
white hot pain.

510
00:19:31.589 --> 00:19:33.189
The whole spectrum is dukkha.

511
00:19:33.189 --> 00:19:35.631
But likewise then we have this corollary term,

512
00:19:35.631 --> 00:19:37.188
the antonym, and that is sukha,

513
00:19:37.188 --> 00:19:38.959
and that's everything from,

514
00:19:38.959 --> 00:19:43.959
"I like that feeling on my cheek," you know, kinda,

515
00:19:44.121 --> 00:19:48.750
to bliss, to ecstasy, to inconceivable sense of well being.

516
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.716
But then this is where Buddhism...

517
00:19:51.716 --> 00:19:53.816
Buddhism starts here and says

518
00:19:53.816 --> 00:19:57.027
well, whether or not you know anything about great bliss

519
00:19:57.027 --> 00:19:59.683
and so forth and so on, all of us,

520
00:19:59.683 --> 00:20:01.048
I think without exception,

521
00:20:01.048 --> 00:20:03.000
we know something about dissatisfaction.

522
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.083
Pain, unhappiness, depression, we know about that.

523
00:20:06.083 --> 00:20:08.013
Nobody needs to teach us.

524
00:20:08.013 --> 00:20:10.328
We don't get through infancy into childhood

525
00:20:10.328 --> 00:20:12.397
without knowing something about pain,

526
00:20:12.397 --> 00:20:13.720
and we don't like it.

527
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.895
Pain, unhappiness, the whole array, we don't like it.

528
00:20:15.895 --> 00:20:17.517
It's almost defined by, "Don't like it."

529
00:20:17.517 --> 00:20:20.694
And so instead of simply avoiding it...

530
00:20:20.694 --> 00:20:23.148
This is what started really getting me,

531
00:20:23.148 --> 00:20:25.387
like, "I'm not leaving."

532
00:20:25.387 --> 00:20:26.988
I mean, I was there on a trial run,

533
00:20:26.988 --> 00:20:28.652
I thought if Buddhism didn't work out,

534
00:20:28.652 --> 00:20:30.806
I'd just head off to New Zealand, become a shepherd.

535
00:20:30.806 --> 00:20:34.305
A rather romantic, probably silly, idea.

536
00:20:34.305 --> 00:20:35.627
I didn't want Western civilization,

537
00:20:35.627 --> 00:20:37.611
if Buddha wound up being a wash out,

538
00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:39.179
then I'd say, "Neither the East nor the West,

539
00:20:39.179 --> 00:20:42.453
"I'm just going to go off to New Zealand and watch sheep."

540
00:20:42.453 --> 00:20:46.208
No, but what kept me there was,

541
00:20:46.208 --> 00:20:48.725
this is potent stuff, and that is take this reality.

542
00:20:48.725 --> 00:20:49.941
The first so-called noble truth is

543
00:20:49.941 --> 00:20:52.789
reality of dissatisfaction, of dukkha, the whole bandwidth,

544
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:55.252
and instead of simply trying to avoid it,

545
00:20:55.252 --> 00:20:58.314
to dodge it, to suppress it, to blink,

546
00:20:58.314 --> 00:21:00.063
to shirk away from it,

547
00:21:00.063 --> 00:21:03.007
Buddha said, "Here's the reality of suffering.

548
00:21:03.007 --> 00:21:04.842
"Recognize it."

549
00:21:04.842 --> 00:21:05.918
So like a doctor that would.

550
00:21:05.918 --> 00:21:06.975
If you come into the doctor, you say,

551
00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:08.553
"I feel terrible," the doctor would say,

552
00:21:08.553 --> 00:21:10.569
"Well, first tell me all your symptoms.

553
00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:13.171
"Tell me all your symptoms, where do you feel terrible?

554
00:21:13.171 --> 00:21:14.857
"How long," and so forth and so on.

555
00:21:14.857 --> 00:21:17.289
And then when the doctor's got the full set

556
00:21:17.289 --> 00:21:19.422
of symptoms that you can possibly articulate,

557
00:21:19.422 --> 00:21:20.990
having paid close attention,

558
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:22.793
then he says, "All right,

559
00:21:22.793 --> 00:21:24.914
"now let's do some measurements here."

560
00:21:24.914 --> 00:21:27.774
So open, say ah, the x-ray, whatever it is.

561
00:21:27.774 --> 00:21:30.269
Now let's try to find out what's ailing you,

562
00:21:30.269 --> 00:21:32.467
what are the underlying causes?

563
00:21:32.467 --> 00:21:33.565
Not, "Oh, you feel bad?

564
00:21:33.565 --> 00:21:36.242
"Good, here's an anaesthetic."

565
00:21:36.242 --> 00:21:38.728
Or just whack you over the--

566
00:21:38.728 --> 00:21:40.029
<v Interviewer>Not much inquiry there.</v>

567
00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:41.810
<v ->There you go, just whack you over the frontal cortex,</v>

568
00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:44.113
stun you into oblivion.

569
00:21:44.113 --> 00:21:46.652
No, they don't try to just suppress symptoms,

570
00:21:46.652 --> 00:21:48.050
if they're truly healers,

571
00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.385
they try to find out what the causes are,

572
00:21:50.385 --> 00:21:53.372
and then, having identified the causes to the best extent,

573
00:21:53.372 --> 00:21:56.582
then they see is the prognosis one that we might actually

574
00:21:56.582 --> 00:21:58.438
consider a full cure?

575
00:21:58.438 --> 00:22:00.017
If that's a possibility, then you consider, "Well, good.

576
00:22:00.017 --> 00:22:02.865
"How do we go about doing that?"

577
00:22:02.865 --> 00:22:04.891
That is the model of all of Buddhism.

578
00:22:04.891 --> 00:22:06.459
It's called the four noble truths.

579
00:22:06.459 --> 00:22:08.187
There's a reality of suffering,

580
00:22:08.187 --> 00:22:10.192
which we check our experientially,

581
00:22:10.192 --> 00:22:11.663
not taking somebody else's word for it,

582
00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:13.957
so it's not an authority based kind of entry.

583
00:22:13.957 --> 00:22:16.154
Then, what about the causes of suffering?

584
00:22:16.154 --> 00:22:17.924
Well, once again, don't look elsewhere.

585
00:22:17.924 --> 00:22:19.216
Don't ask somebody else,

586
00:22:19.216 --> 00:22:21.306
check in your own experience.

587
00:22:21.306 --> 00:22:24.357
What are the causes of suffering that you experience?

588
00:22:24.357 --> 00:22:27.162
And then you also attend to the people around you

589
00:22:27.162 --> 00:22:29.743
and see if you can identify what is central.

590
00:22:29.743 --> 00:22:31.770
Because almost anything, perhaps anything, could

591
00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.625
catalyze unhappiness.

592
00:22:33.625 --> 00:22:35.311
I was with somebody recently who,

593
00:22:35.311 --> 00:22:37.444
it was a really beautiful, sunny day in Santa Barbara,

594
00:22:37.444 --> 00:22:39.652
and he looked at it and became visibly very upset,

595
00:22:39.652 --> 00:22:41.582
and he said, "I hate this weather.

596
00:22:41.582 --> 00:22:43.417
"I hate this weather, it should be cloudy,

597
00:22:43.417 --> 00:22:44.697
"it should be overcast.

598
00:22:44.697 --> 00:22:46.403
"I really hate this weather."

599
00:22:46.403 --> 00:22:48.291
I think, "Whoa," you know?

600
00:22:48.291 --> 00:22:49.838
Sunny day in Santa Barbara in November.

601
00:22:49.838 --> 00:22:52.846
But, you know, for that person at that time,

602
00:22:52.846 --> 00:22:54.125
it was just unpleasant.

603
00:22:54.125 --> 00:22:55.789
It was hot, it was unpleasant, it was dry.

604
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:57.741
We are having a drought here, after all.

605
00:22:57.741 --> 00:22:59.992
So if a sunny day in Santa Barbara could get you down,

606
00:22:59.992 --> 00:23:01.901
well then what couldn't?

607
00:23:01.901 --> 00:23:03.938
So then we can ask, well, all right,

608
00:23:03.938 --> 00:23:06.157
well almost anything could get me down,

609
00:23:06.157 --> 00:23:07.767
make me miserable and so forth.

610
00:23:07.767 --> 00:23:10.178
But then other people go through tremendous adversity

611
00:23:10.178 --> 00:23:11.906
and they don't become miserable.

612
00:23:11.906 --> 00:23:14.327
So it's clearly not simply you were in the wrong place

613
00:23:14.327 --> 00:23:15.831
at the wrong time,

614
00:23:15.831 --> 00:23:17.025
but people respond differently.

615
00:23:17.025 --> 00:23:19.425
So now let's be like Sherlock Holmes here,

616
00:23:19.425 --> 00:23:20.769
let's be an investigator,

617
00:23:20.769 --> 00:23:23.489
find out what are the essential causes of suffering,

618
00:23:23.489 --> 00:23:26.945
and then see, if you possibly can, or just investigate

619
00:23:26.945 --> 00:23:29.771
are these inner causes?

620
00:23:29.771 --> 00:23:31.286
Because they are inner, after all.

621
00:23:31.286 --> 00:23:34.496
Are they indelibly, intrinsically a part of your own being,

622
00:23:34.496 --> 00:23:35.702
your own mind and so forth?

623
00:23:35.702 --> 00:23:37.451
Are we just wired that way?

624
00:23:37.451 --> 00:23:38.805
is it core to our existence?

625
00:23:38.805 --> 00:23:41.973
Or are these more like a virus, more like an affliction,

626
00:23:41.973 --> 00:23:44.437
something that is obscuring a deeper nature

627
00:23:44.437 --> 00:23:45.813
that is not afflicted?

628
00:23:45.813 --> 00:23:48.298
The Buddhist hypothesis, and this is the way to accept it,

629
00:23:48.298 --> 00:23:49.620
not just as dogma,

630
00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:51.466
the Buddhist hypothesis is, based upon

631
00:23:51.466 --> 00:23:52.906
the Buddha's own experience,

632
00:23:52.906 --> 00:23:54.879
is that we're not made that way.

633
00:23:54.879 --> 00:23:57.012
We're not intrinsically here to suffer, we don't

634
00:23:57.012 --> 00:23:59.348
intrinsically have these causes of suffering within.

635
00:23:59.348 --> 00:24:01.417
So there's the hypothesis.

636
00:24:01.417 --> 00:24:03.838
Take it as a working hypothesis if you're so inclined.

637
00:24:03.838 --> 00:24:06.068
If you're not, have a nice day, find something else to do.

638
00:24:06.068 --> 00:24:08.595
But if you want to take that as a working hypothesis,

639
00:24:08.595 --> 00:24:10.579
that we actually can be healed,

640
00:24:10.579 --> 00:24:12.617
or at least we can suffer a lot less,

641
00:24:12.617 --> 00:24:14.142
and we can find much greater happiness,

642
00:24:14.142 --> 00:24:15.454
then here's a path.

643
00:24:15.454 --> 00:24:17.310
And he laid out the path, and I alluded to this

644
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:19.560
in my very short presentation today,

645
00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.003
as a moderator, it was really short.

646
00:24:22.003 --> 00:24:25.394
But number one, live a wholesome life.

647
00:24:25.394 --> 00:24:27.794
I mean, that's just baseline.

648
00:24:27.794 --> 00:24:29.170
Live a wholesome life.

649
00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:32.178
Don't, with your speech, with your physical behaviour,

650
00:24:32.178 --> 00:24:33.906
don't injure.

651
00:24:33.906 --> 00:24:35.229
It's, you know, the ancient Indian-

652
00:24:35.229 --> 00:24:36.348
<v Interviewer>Do not cause harm.</v>

653
00:24:36.348 --> 00:24:37.703
<v ->Do not cause harm, ahimsa.</v>

654
00:24:37.703 --> 00:24:38.908
Non-injury,

655
00:24:38.908 --> 00:24:41.041
I mean, there's enough misery in the world already.

656
00:24:41.041 --> 00:24:43.857
Illness, aging, natural calamities and so forth and so on,

657
00:24:43.857 --> 00:24:45.948
and to say, "No, we don't have enough suffering,

658
00:24:45.948 --> 00:24:47.153
"I'm gonna go out and be mean to people.

659
00:24:47.153 --> 00:24:48.550
"I'll be abusive, and cheat them,

660
00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:50.768
and betray their confidence and so forth."

661
00:24:50.768 --> 00:24:53.221
What's wrong with you?

662
00:24:53.221 --> 00:24:54.875
Don't we already have enough

663
00:24:54.875 --> 00:24:57.329
that just comes to us by nature?

664
00:24:57.329 --> 00:25:00.378
So living a non-injurious way of life,

665
00:25:00.378 --> 00:25:02.938
and then not stopping there, just to be passive,

666
00:25:02.938 --> 00:25:05.946
but say, "Well, where's an opportunity to be of service?

667
00:25:05.946 --> 00:25:08.079
"When can I do a bit of good?

668
00:25:08.079 --> 00:25:10.191
"Can I alleviate somebody else's suffering?

669
00:25:10.191 --> 00:25:11.290
"Can I bring them some happiness?

670
00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:12.826
"Can I do something for the greater good?

671
00:25:12.826 --> 00:25:15.556
Be a good husband, a good father," and so forth and so on.

672
00:25:15.556 --> 00:25:18.596
That's ethics, that's all of Buddhist ethics.

673
00:25:18.596 --> 00:25:21.220
But I looked at that and say, "Boy, that's refreshing.

674
00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.513
"Because that just makes really good sense,

675
00:25:23.513 --> 00:25:24.793
"and I want to do that."
<v Interviewer>Common sense.</v>

676
00:25:24.793 --> 00:25:26.499
<v ->It's common sense, and I really want to do that.</v>

677
00:25:26.499 --> 00:25:27.886
And then we can get specific,

678
00:25:27.886 --> 00:25:29.347
and maybe start looking at, "Well,

679
00:25:29.347 --> 00:25:30.744
"if I behave in such a way,

680
00:25:30.744 --> 00:25:32.825
"if I speak in such and such a way,

681
00:25:32.825 --> 00:25:34.222
"what's the impact?"

682
00:25:34.222 --> 00:25:36.067
And then watch closely.

683
00:25:36.067 --> 00:25:37.741
I may be just speaking kinda mindlessly

684
00:25:37.741 --> 00:25:39.769
and then suddenly find, "Oh, I've hurt somebody's feelings.

685
00:25:39.769 --> 00:25:41.901
"That was rude, that was very thoughtless.

686
00:25:41.901 --> 00:25:43.992
"I was very condescending there.

687
00:25:43.992 --> 00:25:45.336
"They didn't like that."

688
00:25:45.336 --> 00:25:49.037
Then we start to see, oh, it's not that God said so,

689
00:25:49.037 --> 00:25:51.671
or Buddha said so, but I spoke in such and such a way,

690
00:25:51.671 --> 00:25:53.890
or I physically behave in such and such a way,

691
00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:55.330
somebody got hurt.

692
00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.143
<v Interviewer>So mindfulness, then, comes in.</v>

693
00:25:57.143 --> 00:25:58.295
<v ->Exactly.</v>

694
00:25:58.295 --> 00:26:01.548
You can't have any really meaningful ethics

695
00:26:01.548 --> 00:26:03.596
without being attentive.

696
00:26:03.596 --> 00:26:06.156
Mindful not only of what the behaviour is,

697
00:26:06.156 --> 00:26:08.107
not just from moment to moment to moment,

698
00:26:08.107 --> 00:26:09.771
but observing from moment to moment I behave

699
00:26:09.771 --> 00:26:12.779
and then, moments later, maybe a week later,

700
00:26:12.779 --> 00:26:14.934
maybe a month later, you see, "Oh,

701
00:26:14.934 --> 00:26:16.843
"I had no idea that I hurt you with that comment.

702
00:26:16.843 --> 00:26:18.699
"I'm so sorry."

703
00:26:18.699 --> 00:26:22.293
<v Interviewer>And that takes humility to do that,</v>

704
00:26:22.293 --> 00:26:23.818
for some people.

705
00:26:23.818 --> 00:26:26.826
It's very difficult to say, for many, "I'm sorry."

706
00:26:26.826 --> 00:26:28.992
<v ->A good does of honesty is a good start,</v>

707
00:26:28.992 --> 00:26:30.645
just seeing clearly,

708
00:26:30.645 --> 00:26:32.596
and then when we see that we've truly erred...

709
00:26:32.596 --> 00:26:34.687
I mean, if it we did it maliciously, we really wanted to

710
00:26:34.687 --> 00:26:36.735
harm somebody, then that's that,

711
00:26:36.735 --> 00:26:38.602
and then now look at malice.

712
00:26:38.602 --> 00:26:41.183
Is malice something conducive to your own well being?

713
00:26:41.183 --> 00:26:42.143
Does is make you happy?

714
00:26:42.143 --> 00:26:45.204
Is there a sense of fulfilment, of contentment and so forth

715
00:26:45.204 --> 00:26:46.953
being a malicious person?

716
00:26:46.953 --> 00:26:48.808
It's not being judgemental here, or moralistic

717
00:26:48.808 --> 00:26:51.368
in some kind of pious way,

718
00:26:51.368 --> 00:26:53.277
it's just saying, "You want to be happy?

719
00:26:53.277 --> 00:26:54.921
"Malice is not very compatible with that."

720
00:26:54.921 --> 00:26:55.976
<v Interviewer>Not very useful.</v>

721
00:26:55.976 --> 00:26:57.278
<v ->Not very useful, and in fact,</v>

722
00:26:57.278 --> 00:26:58.984
quite to the contrary.

723
00:26:58.984 --> 00:27:03.090
Mindfulness, in this regard, is integral to ethics,

724
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.523
and ethics becomes an ongoing,

725
00:27:05.523 --> 00:27:07.250
I would almost say adventure.

726
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.952
Because it's not like I had a list of ten don'ts.

727
00:27:10.952 --> 00:27:12.189
<v Interviewer>Your ten commandments.</v>

728
00:27:12.189 --> 00:27:13.266
<v ->Ten commandments, we have them.</v>

729
00:27:13.266 --> 00:27:14.994
We have ten non-virtues in Buddhism.

730
00:27:14.994 --> 00:27:16.542
But just saying, "I made it through the day,

731
00:27:16.542 --> 00:27:17.735
"I didn't commit any of the ten.

732
00:27:17.735 --> 00:27:19.260
"I've been a good boy, I've been a good boy scout,

733
00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.636
"give me a merit badge."

734
00:27:20.636 --> 00:27:22.631
That's a boring approach to ethics,

735
00:27:22.631 --> 00:27:25.329
but now on the path to spiritual awakening,

736
00:27:25.329 --> 00:27:29.148
then ethics becomes more and more challenging.

737
00:27:29.148 --> 00:27:31.302
We fine tune it, we fine tune it, we fine tune it

738
00:27:31.302 --> 00:27:32.849
as we attend more and more closely

739
00:27:32.849 --> 00:27:36.731
what types of behaviour gives rise to unrest,

740
00:27:36.731 --> 00:27:40.486
disequilibrium, conflict within my own mind,

741
00:27:40.486 --> 00:27:42.907
conflict in my relationship with others,

742
00:27:42.907 --> 00:27:46.117
unhappiness, discord for other people,

743
00:27:46.117 --> 00:27:47.781
and we mustn't neglect,

744
00:27:47.781 --> 00:27:50.053
it's not always just with other sentient beings,

745
00:27:50.053 --> 00:27:52.026
human animals, but also the environment.

746
00:27:52.026 --> 00:27:54.490
There is unethical behaviour with regard to the environment.

747
00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:56.111
How do we treat our natural resources?

748
00:27:56.111 --> 00:27:58.351
The air, the water, the soil, and so forth.

749
00:27:58.351 --> 00:28:00.623
This is ethical, this is a matter of ethics.

750
00:28:00.623 --> 00:28:04.463
This becomes, really, one could say a science of ethics,

751
00:28:04.463 --> 00:28:06.030
an adventure of ethics.

752
00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.399
How should we individually and collectively behave

753
00:28:08.399 --> 00:28:11.449
such that our conduct is not injurious to the environment,

754
00:28:11.449 --> 00:28:13.870
that we're offering to the next generation,

755
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:16.430
when we pass away, an environment that is at least

756
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:18.723
as conducive for human flourishing

757
00:28:18.723 --> 00:28:20.312
and the flourishing of the biodiversity on our planet

758
00:28:20.312 --> 00:28:21.976
as the one we recieved.

759
00:28:21.976 --> 00:28:23.438
That is ethical.

760
00:28:23.438 --> 00:28:25.166
We've not been living up to that one very well.

761
00:28:25.166 --> 00:28:27.235
<v Interviewer>No, we have not done well.</v>

762
00:28:27.235 --> 00:28:29.123
Now, what about more subtle factors,

763
00:28:29.123 --> 00:28:31.202
such as the notion of having

764
00:28:31.202 --> 00:28:33.570
very strong personal preferences?

765
00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:36.098
I think many people suffer because of their attachment

766
00:28:36.098 --> 00:28:38.861
to their own strong personal preferences.

767
00:28:38.861 --> 00:28:39.853
<v ->Sure.</v>

768
00:28:39.853 --> 00:28:41.293
<v Interviewer>How does this come in?</v>

769
00:28:41.293 --> 00:28:42.935
It's just a little more subtle level of learning,

770
00:28:42.935 --> 00:28:45.826
once you pass on the malice and so forth.

771
00:28:45.826 --> 00:28:47.106
<v ->Sure, sure.</v>

772
00:28:47.106 --> 00:28:48.545
Well, there's this kind of entry level,

773
00:28:48.545 --> 00:28:51.820
which is an absolutely indispensable foundation,

774
00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.078
living ethically.

775
00:28:53.078 --> 00:28:54.582
So whatever your preferences are and so forth,

776
00:28:54.582 --> 00:28:57.889
more subtle issues, at least do no harm.

777
00:28:57.889 --> 00:28:59.659
At least that, you know.

778
00:28:59.659 --> 00:29:01.345
And then if you can spiritual on top of that,

779
00:29:01.345 --> 00:29:02.785
if you want to meditate, or you want to go

780
00:29:02.785 --> 00:29:04.982
into subtler dimensions, that's all very well,

781
00:29:04.982 --> 00:29:08.128
but in the mean time at least don't do any harm here.

782
00:29:08.128 --> 00:29:12.213
And then we move into this area of self centered desires.

783
00:29:12.213 --> 00:29:14.165
Self centered desires, and then as soon as I have

784
00:29:14.165 --> 00:29:16.565
a self centered desire and sometime gets in the way,

785
00:29:16.565 --> 00:29:19.146
then I have a self centered anger,

786
00:29:19.146 --> 00:29:22.090
or I have a self centered desire that doesn't happen,

787
00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:23.711
and then somebody dishes that up,

788
00:29:23.711 --> 00:29:25.588
or maybe just reality dishes it up,

789
00:29:25.588 --> 00:29:27.294
I get angry at reality?

790
00:29:27.294 --> 00:29:28.650
Which is not a very good idea.

791
00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:32.468
And so there, once again, now we're working

792
00:29:32.468 --> 00:29:35.838
not so much on behaviour, but now how the mind functions.

793
00:29:35.838 --> 00:29:38.420
This is what I was alluding to earlier today

794
00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.553
when I spoke of equality of well being,

795
00:29:40.553 --> 00:29:43.849
foundationally, that arises from leading

796
00:29:43.849 --> 00:29:45.715
an ethical way of life,

797
00:29:45.715 --> 00:29:48.094
so you can die without remorse.

798
00:29:48.094 --> 00:29:49.982
You have a sense of blamelessness that

799
00:29:49.982 --> 00:29:52.136
I didn't do much damage, and I really tried to

800
00:29:52.136 --> 00:29:53.864
do some good where I could.

801
00:29:53.864 --> 00:29:54.984
Good foundation.

802
00:29:54.984 --> 00:29:57.704
But then there's a whole other level of well being.

803
00:29:57.704 --> 00:29:59.122
And all of this, I must say, gradually

804
00:29:59.122 --> 00:30:03.111
dawned on me during these early years that I was training,

805
00:30:03.111 --> 00:30:05.319
very intensively, from the early '70s,

806
00:30:05.319 --> 00:30:06.802
in Dharamsala.

807
00:30:06.802 --> 00:30:09.116
But then there's another whole dimension of well being

808
00:30:09.116 --> 00:30:13.351
that comes not simply how we conduct ourselves,

809
00:30:13.351 --> 00:30:16.540
by way of speech and by physical behaviour,

810
00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:19.324
but now the actual cultivation of the mind,

811
00:30:19.324 --> 00:30:22.993
and recognizing I can sit in a room all by myself

812
00:30:22.993 --> 00:30:25.478
and make myself utterly miserable.

813
00:30:25.478 --> 00:30:27.505
I can also... There are yogis,

814
00:30:27.505 --> 00:30:29.990
there are others, who can sit all by themselves in a room

815
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:31.792
and be utterly content,

816
00:30:31.792 --> 00:30:33.275
and actually experience bliss.

817
00:30:33.275 --> 00:30:35.493
And not only in isolation, as if they just

818
00:30:35.493 --> 00:30:37.690
have a high dopamine level or something like that,

819
00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:39.898
but a profound sense of connectedness.

820
00:30:39.898 --> 00:30:42.821
The Dalai Lama was asked once whether he ever feels lonely.

821
00:30:42.821 --> 00:30:45.381
Here he is, you know, he's had a very unusual life.

822
00:30:45.381 --> 00:30:47.034
He said, "No, I never feel lonely.

823
00:30:47.034 --> 00:30:49.327
"Whether I am with others or whether I'm in solitude,

824
00:30:49.327 --> 00:30:51.844
"I always feel a sense of connectedness."

825
00:30:51.844 --> 00:30:54.042
The sense of empathy, the sense of caring

826
00:30:54.042 --> 00:30:56.068
for the greater world,

827
00:30:56.068 --> 00:30:57.833
even if you're spending some time in solitude.

828
00:30:57.833 --> 00:31:00.585
So there's a whole arena there, a whole domain

829
00:31:00.585 --> 00:31:04.179
of meditative practice that we call samadhi,

830
00:31:04.179 --> 00:31:06.355
or we can call, more broadly, meditation.

831
00:31:06.355 --> 00:31:08.755
It's not something esoteric or occultish

832
00:31:08.755 --> 00:31:10.211
or paranormal or weird.

833
00:31:10.211 --> 00:31:14.098
The cultivation of the mind is specifically

834
00:31:14.098 --> 00:31:17.597
recognizing those tendencies in the mind, those impulses,

835
00:31:17.597 --> 00:31:20.989
that are destructive to our own and others' well being,

836
00:31:20.989 --> 00:31:23.079
and those tendencies that are conducive

837
00:31:23.079 --> 00:31:25.351
to our own and others' well being,

838
00:31:25.351 --> 00:31:27.591
and then, just like a gardener coming into a field,

839
00:31:27.591 --> 00:31:29.169
a field of one's own mind,

840
00:31:29.169 --> 00:31:32.988
then seeing how can I gradually weed out,

841
00:31:32.988 --> 00:31:35.654
at least not feed, gradually weed out

842
00:31:35.654 --> 00:31:37.766
the tendencies of pettiness, selfishness,

843
00:31:37.766 --> 00:31:41.318
arrogance, sarcasm, condescension, and so forth.

844
00:31:41.318 --> 00:31:44.507
Gradually weed those out, not by just sheer muscle power,

845
00:31:44.507 --> 00:31:47.152
but by understanding and by attending closely

846
00:31:47.152 --> 00:31:49.104
to the needs of others, their yearnings,

847
00:31:49.104 --> 00:31:50.245
their hopes and fears.

848
00:31:50.245 --> 00:31:51.557
A lot of those just get washed out.

849
00:31:51.557 --> 00:31:54.117
And then attending to, like your vegetable garden,

850
00:31:54.117 --> 00:31:56.048
what are these tendencies and impulses

851
00:31:56.048 --> 00:31:59.280
in my heart and mind that are truly conducive

852
00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.071
to my own and others' well being,

853
00:32:01.071 --> 00:32:02.533
and cultivating those.

854
00:32:02.533 --> 00:32:04.218
So that's this whole realm

855
00:32:04.218 --> 00:32:06.394
of the cultivation of the heart and mind

856
00:32:06.394 --> 00:32:07.972
that we call meditation.

857
00:32:07.972 --> 00:32:10.234
It's not just something for religious people,

858
00:32:10.234 --> 00:32:11.716
because it's not just religious people who have

859
00:32:11.716 --> 00:32:13.135
the inner causes of suffering,

860
00:32:13.135 --> 00:32:14.297
the inner causes of happiness.

861
00:32:14.297 --> 00:32:15.673
It's really anybody.

862
00:32:15.673 --> 00:32:17.124
So, frankly, if I were asked,

863
00:32:17.124 --> 00:32:18.542
"Do you think everybody should meditate?"

864
00:32:18.542 --> 00:32:19.780
My answer would be yes.

865
00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.606
Now, should everybody be Buddhist?

866
00:32:22.606 --> 00:32:23.726
No.

867
00:32:23.726 --> 00:32:24.921
And this is where the preferences...

868
00:32:24.921 --> 00:32:27.384
Let's put a positive spin on preferences.

869
00:32:27.384 --> 00:32:30.126
And that is, the Dalai Lama's made this point many times,

870
00:32:30.126 --> 00:32:31.811
and I am very much a student of his,

871
00:32:31.811 --> 00:32:34.328
I agree with him entirely on this point.

872
00:32:34.328 --> 00:32:37.336
That it is not a Buddhist ideal, never has been,

873
00:32:37.336 --> 00:32:39.224
that somehow we can be clever enough,

874
00:32:39.224 --> 00:32:41.741
persuasive enough, powerful enough,

875
00:32:41.741 --> 00:32:45.111
that if we could convert everybody to Buddhism,

876
00:32:45.111 --> 00:32:47.042
now that would be really great.

877
00:32:47.042 --> 00:32:48.994
It's never been an idea in Buddhism, ever.

878
00:32:48.994 --> 00:32:50.807
Because it's not the most appropriate

879
00:32:50.807 --> 00:32:53.281
or beneficial path for everybody.

880
00:32:53.281 --> 00:32:55.724
There are some people for whom

881
00:32:55.724 --> 00:32:57.591
Christianity speaks to the heart,

882
00:32:57.591 --> 00:32:59.788
it speaks to the mind, it fills them with inspiration.

883
00:32:59.788 --> 00:33:02.262
This is absolutely where they gravitate to.

884
00:33:02.262 --> 00:33:04.353
It is their path.

885
00:33:04.353 --> 00:33:06.390
<v Interviewer>Let me ask a question at this point.</v>

886
00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:09.536
With the Tibetan faith,

887
00:33:09.536 --> 00:33:11.627
or the Tibetan practice,

888
00:33:11.627 --> 00:33:16.565
there is a belief or an understanding that this is a wheel,

889
00:33:16.565 --> 00:33:18.592
this is a wheel of life.

890
00:33:18.592 --> 00:33:20.565
To incarnate, and to incarnate again,

891
00:33:20.565 --> 00:33:23.253
and this is very much a part of the Dalai Lama's path,

892
00:33:23.253 --> 00:33:25.279
and all great Lamas.

893
00:33:25.279 --> 00:33:29.322
So might it be that a person is finding their preference,

894
00:33:29.322 --> 00:33:30.868
as you say, in a positive way,

895
00:33:30.868 --> 00:33:35.562
for a given religion as a result of this conditioning

896
00:33:35.562 --> 00:33:38.079
from other times in carrying this forward,

897
00:33:38.079 --> 00:33:40.115
out of familiarity, even?

898
00:33:40.115 --> 00:33:41.983
<v ->I think it's a very good question,</v>

899
00:33:41.983 --> 00:33:44.179
and I will speak, of course, from the Buddhist perspective,

900
00:33:44.179 --> 00:33:46.088
that's how it's couched, so.

901
00:33:46.088 --> 00:33:47.998
The answer is definitely yes.

902
00:33:47.998 --> 00:33:49.481
And I look at myself.

903
00:33:49.481 --> 00:33:52.584
I never felt really at home in the Christian world view,

904
00:33:52.584 --> 00:33:54.536
that Christ was the only son of God,

905
00:33:54.536 --> 00:33:56.648
this is the one true faith and so forth,

906
00:33:56.648 --> 00:33:58.291
and all the other religions, well,

907
00:33:58.291 --> 00:34:01.053
it kind of didn't really make it.

908
00:34:01.053 --> 00:34:02.727
Or we've heard recently just from the pope,

909
00:34:02.727 --> 00:34:05.096
saying he's kind of rather skeptical about the whole notion

910
00:34:05.096 --> 00:34:06.504
of interfaith dialogue

911
00:34:06.504 --> 00:34:08.733
as if you should somehow bracket your beliefs.

912
00:34:08.733 --> 00:34:12.477
I think he really does believe there's only one true faith,

913
00:34:12.477 --> 00:34:14.044
and so if we're going to have interfaith dialogue,

914
00:34:14.044 --> 00:34:16.114
well, would you like to know what the truth is?

915
00:34:16.114 --> 00:34:17.148
I'll tell you what the truth is.

916
00:34:17.148 --> 00:34:19.143
It's my faith, not your faith.

917
00:34:19.143 --> 00:34:22.652
He's a very intelligent man, and there are many Christians

918
00:34:22.652 --> 00:34:24.945
who are likewise, has great integrity,

919
00:34:24.945 --> 00:34:26.876
great intelligence.

920
00:34:26.876 --> 00:34:29.179
I just can't go that way,

921
00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:32.347
any more than, and this is a strong parallel,

922
00:34:32.347 --> 00:34:36.187
any more than I can think, could even imagine,

923
00:34:36.187 --> 00:34:38.480
that there's only one way to know reality,

924
00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.955
and that's by way of modern science and technology.

925
00:34:40.955 --> 00:34:42.831
I think, "I've heard that one before,

926
00:34:42.831 --> 00:34:44.453
"I rejected that when I was 13,

927
00:34:44.453 --> 00:34:46.384
"and I'm rejecting now at the age of 58."

928
00:34:46.384 --> 00:34:49.306
There is no one true way to truth.

929
00:34:49.306 --> 00:34:50.543
I've never believed that,

930
00:34:50.543 --> 00:34:52.677
and I just think it's provincial, closed minded thinking

931
00:34:52.677 --> 00:34:54.938
whoever does it, whether it's materialists

932
00:34:54.938 --> 00:34:58.628
or whether it's dogmatic religious people.

933
00:34:58.628 --> 00:35:03.628
So the diversity, the multiple perspectives,

934
00:35:03.791 --> 00:35:05.359
and from a religious perspective,

935
00:35:05.359 --> 00:35:06.905
I look at myself.

936
00:35:06.905 --> 00:35:08.889
Here I was a fish out of water.

937
00:35:08.889 --> 00:35:10.414
I couldn't just become a scientist.

938
00:35:10.414 --> 00:35:12.611
I thought, "That's gonna be a barren wasteland for me.

939
00:35:12.611 --> 00:35:15.011
"I'm looking for meaning and it does not deliver."

940
00:35:15.011 --> 00:35:18.744
Then I looked at religion, and that particular motif,

941
00:35:18.744 --> 00:35:20.963
it just doesn't resonate, it doesn't make any sense

942
00:35:20.963 --> 00:35:22.872
that I should follow Christianity

943
00:35:22.872 --> 00:35:24.439
because I was born in Pasadena,

944
00:35:24.439 --> 00:35:27.852
whereas if I were born in, let's say, Baghdad,

945
00:35:27.852 --> 00:35:29.026
I would be a Muslim.

946
00:35:29.026 --> 00:35:30.594
If I were born in Jerusalem I'd be...

947
00:35:30.594 --> 00:35:32.216
I'm supposed to follow something

948
00:35:32.216 --> 00:35:34.146
because of where I was born?

949
00:35:34.146 --> 00:35:35.586
And say that's the one true faith,

950
00:35:35.586 --> 00:35:36.973
because I was born in this place?

951
00:35:36.973 --> 00:35:39.628
I think, "Wait a minute.

952
00:35:39.628 --> 00:35:41.505
"I can't do that, that's ridiculous."

953
00:35:41.505 --> 00:35:44.267
I got the truth right because I was born in the right place?

954
00:35:44.267 --> 00:35:48.065
Give me a break, that just doesn't make any sense.

955
00:35:48.065 --> 00:35:51.777
So I look at myself, and there I was,

956
00:35:51.777 --> 00:35:54.646
disoriented, frustrated, disenchanted,

957
00:35:54.646 --> 00:35:56.715
not finding anything I could connect with.

958
00:35:56.715 --> 00:35:59.275
I pick up one book on Tibetan Buddhism.

959
00:35:59.275 --> 00:36:01.739
<v Interviewer>And your life does an about face.</v>

960
00:36:01.739 --> 00:36:04.331
<v ->And it was no return.</v>

961
00:36:04.331 --> 00:36:06.229
It was just no return, this is it.

962
00:36:06.229 --> 00:36:07.808
I will make any sacrifice,

963
00:36:07.808 --> 00:36:09.675
and I made large sacrifices.

964
00:36:09.675 --> 00:36:11.914
This is it, this is utterly it,

965
00:36:11.914 --> 00:36:13.258
and I will carry on through.

966
00:36:13.258 --> 00:36:15.392
I find it was very easy to learn Tibetan.

967
00:36:15.392 --> 00:36:16.565
I learned it very rapidly,

968
00:36:16.565 --> 00:36:17.685
my pronunciation's very good,

969
00:36:17.685 --> 00:36:19.413
rather like a Tibetan,

970
00:36:19.413 --> 00:36:21.812
and I've felt at home ever since.

971
00:36:21.812 --> 00:36:22.719
<v Interviewer>Interesting.</v>

972
00:36:22.719 --> 00:36:24.533
Have you any idea why you chose to incarnate

973
00:36:24.533 --> 00:36:27.273
in Pasadena, into a Christian family,

974
00:36:27.273 --> 00:36:30.441
into a Caucasian body?

975
00:36:30.441 --> 00:36:32.681
<v ->I certainly make no claims to clairvoyance,</v>

976
00:36:32.681 --> 00:36:35.113
but if I should try to,

977
00:36:35.113 --> 00:36:36.115
more just in terms of...

978
00:36:36.115 --> 00:36:37.182
<v Interviewer>Your own feeling.</v>

979
00:36:37.182 --> 00:36:38.526
<v ->My own feeling, yeah,</v>

980
00:36:38.526 --> 00:36:40.617
so there makes no esoteric claims.

981
00:36:40.617 --> 00:36:44.030
I did have a sense very early on,

982
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:46.515
that is, from the age of 20, when I encountered Buddhism,

983
00:36:46.515 --> 00:36:48.605
that I felt I'm here to be of service

984
00:36:48.605 --> 00:36:50.920
and try to bring clarity where I think there's

985
00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.936
a lot of muddledness.

986
00:36:52.936 --> 00:36:55.272
I've never had the motivation,

987
00:36:55.272 --> 00:36:57.885
in fact, I have rather an antipathy towards the notion

988
00:36:57.885 --> 00:37:01.181
of going out there and being an evangelist.

989
00:37:01.181 --> 00:37:02.781
You know, "Here's my way,

990
00:37:02.781 --> 00:37:04.284
"I have to get you to believe with me.

991
00:37:04.284 --> 00:37:05.788
"Come on, let's gather the flock,

992
00:37:05.788 --> 00:37:06.866
"everybody believe with me."

993
00:37:06.866 --> 00:37:08.412
I find that repugnant.

994
00:37:08.412 --> 00:37:11.526
On the other hand, as you saw me speaking this morning,

995
00:37:11.526 --> 00:37:13.169
I speak with a lot of enthusiasm.

996
00:37:13.169 --> 00:37:16.337
But it never had a notion of, "Now convert to my beliefs,"

997
00:37:16.337 --> 00:37:19.324
but the enthusiasm to dealing open mindedly,

998
00:37:19.324 --> 00:37:21.681
and empirically, and pragmatically

999
00:37:21.681 --> 00:37:23.611
with really important questions.

1000
00:37:23.611 --> 00:37:28.611
I think the type of meditations and theories that I teach

1001
00:37:28.646 --> 00:37:31.387
can be, they have been, on occasion,

1002
00:37:31.387 --> 00:37:33.487
very helpful for Christians,

1003
00:37:33.487 --> 00:37:35.194
and I've had a number of students...

1004
00:37:35.194 --> 00:37:37.104
When I was teaching at the University of California,

1005
00:37:37.104 --> 00:37:39.557
Santa Barbara, I had a number of students.

1006
00:37:39.557 --> 00:37:41.957
One young man just attended a course

1007
00:37:41.957 --> 00:37:43.482
that I took on Tibetan Buddhism.

1008
00:37:43.482 --> 00:37:45.530
He came to me afterwards and he said, "Professor Wallace,

1009
00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:47.802
"I found this course marvelous.

1010
00:37:47.802 --> 00:37:50.810
"I has really deepened my faith in Christianity."

1011
00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:52.313
He was planning to become a priest.

1012
00:37:52.313 --> 00:37:53.796
And there was no sarcasm here,

1013
00:37:53.796 --> 00:37:54.937
like, "What you taught was such hogwash,

1014
00:37:54.937 --> 00:37:56.537
"now I really believe in what I'm doing,"

1015
00:37:56.537 --> 00:37:58.190
but rather I was grappling with the issues,

1016
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:59.993
encouraging him to do so as well,

1017
00:37:59.993 --> 00:38:02.296
and there he was, emboldened in his own faith,

1018
00:38:02.296 --> 00:38:04.121
with an appreciation of Buddhism.

1019
00:38:04.121 --> 00:38:05.561
It wasn't his path, but he said,

1020
00:38:05.561 --> 00:38:07.395
"Boy, they're really grappling with good issues,

1021
00:38:07.395 --> 00:38:09.262
"and I am too, and I'm following the Christian route."

1022
00:38:09.262 --> 00:38:11.663
Another one who was training to become a rabbit

1023
00:38:11.663 --> 00:38:13.080
told me the same thing.

1024
00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.242
<v Interviewer>That's marvelous,</v>

1025
00:38:14.242 --> 00:38:15.533
now you've gotten people to think.

1026
00:38:15.533 --> 00:38:16.963
<v ->That's what makes me happy.</v>

1027
00:38:16.963 --> 00:38:18.179
<v Interviewer>Yes, I can understand that.</v>

1028
00:38:18.179 --> 00:38:19.640
<v ->And if they don't want to go into any religion,</v>

1029
00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:20.856
that's okay.

1030
00:38:20.856 --> 00:38:25.314
I'm down on dogmatic thinking,

1031
00:38:25.314 --> 00:38:26.850
I'm down of closed minded thinking,

1032
00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:28.823
I'm down on the attitude of thinking,

1033
00:38:28.823 --> 00:38:30.530
"We have the only way, and if you don't agree with us,

1034
00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:32.524
"you're just stupid, or your ignorant."

1035
00:38:32.524 --> 00:38:33.847
And I've heard that from materialists,

1036
00:38:33.847 --> 00:38:35.159
I've heard that from religious people,

1037
00:38:35.159 --> 00:38:36.684
I've heard it from philosophers.

1038
00:38:36.684 --> 00:38:39.692
I've heard it from people who have political convictions.

1039
00:38:39.692 --> 00:38:41.174
"If you're not a Democrat, you're stupid."

1040
00:38:41.174 --> 00:38:42.966
"If you're not a Republican, you're just stupid."

1041
00:38:42.966 --> 00:38:45.643
I just can't go that way.

1042
00:38:45.643 --> 00:38:47.254
<v Interviewer>Intelligent.</v>

1043
00:38:47.254 --> 00:38:51.190
What about this, since we were talking about happiness,

1044
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:53.526
you were talking about happiness in this panel today,

1045
00:38:53.526 --> 00:38:54.912
and back to that.

1046
00:38:54.912 --> 00:38:57.004
Obviously, people have been able to gawk

1047
00:38:57.004 --> 00:38:59.723
that you did go back and further your education,

1048
00:38:59.723 --> 00:39:01.408
because you have your PhD,

1049
00:39:01.408 --> 00:39:03.690
and you teach at Stanford, right?

1050
00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:06.145
<v ->No, I taught at UC Santa Barbara.</v>

1051
00:39:06.145 --> 00:39:07.263
<v Interviewer>UC Santa Barbara, right.</v>

1052
00:39:07.263 --> 00:39:08.501
Sorry about that.

1053
00:39:08.501 --> 00:39:09.962
In religious studies,

1054
00:39:09.962 --> 00:39:12.703
and one of the things that you were saying

1055
00:39:12.703 --> 00:39:14.090
towards the end of your talk today

1056
00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:15.935
that I found intriguing is that,

1057
00:39:15.935 --> 00:39:19.049
in Buddhism, there is no belief

1058
00:39:19.049 --> 00:39:21.972
that we have the right to be happy.

1059
00:39:21.972 --> 00:39:23.784
What does that mean exactly?

1060
00:39:23.784 --> 00:39:27.785
<v ->Well, the very notion of a right, this is very theistic.</v>

1061
00:39:27.785 --> 00:39:30.462
It's coming out of our civilization,

1062
00:39:30.462 --> 00:39:32.073
that's one of our babies,

1063
00:39:32.073 --> 00:39:35.400
and it is a notion of a kind of a God given right.

1064
00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.416
I mean, it's right there in the constitution

1065
00:39:37.416 --> 00:39:40.327
whether they were Christian or whether they were deists,

1066
00:39:40.327 --> 00:39:42.173
as in Thomas Jefferson and so forth.

1067
00:39:42.173 --> 00:39:45.256
Nevertheless, that we were so created,

1068
00:39:45.256 --> 00:39:47.560
bear in mind, this is before Darwin ever came along,

1069
00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.426
that we human beings were so created

1070
00:39:49.426 --> 00:39:51.943
that we have certain rights,

1071
00:39:51.943 --> 00:39:53.832
God given rights.

1072
00:39:53.832 --> 00:39:55.826
That phrase kind of rings a bell, doesn't it?

1073
00:39:55.826 --> 00:39:59.036
And God designed the whole shebang,

1074
00:39:59.036 --> 00:40:01.308
this is his baby, he created us in it,

1075
00:40:01.308 --> 00:40:02.897
and he imbued us with certain rights,

1076
00:40:02.897 --> 00:40:04.455
and also thou shalt not.

1077
00:40:04.455 --> 00:40:07.100
"If you behave, I'll reward you,

1078
00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.212
"and if you don't, well, I'm gonna punish you."

1079
00:40:09.212 --> 00:40:11.387
So there it is, that's core to the Abrahamic religions,

1080
00:40:11.387 --> 00:40:12.731
all of them.

1081
00:40:12.731 --> 00:40:15.067
Buddhism doesn't even start there, and never goes there.

1082
00:40:15.067 --> 00:40:17.627
Buddhism says not, "In the beginning,

1083
00:40:17.627 --> 00:40:20.059
"God created the heavens and the Earth,"

1084
00:40:20.059 --> 00:40:21.115
but rather, "There is suffering.

1085
00:40:21.115 --> 00:40:22.480
"Take a look at it."

1086
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.709
That doesn't make any allusion to God at all,

1087
00:40:24.709 --> 00:40:27.013
and it doesn't, also, make any allusion to past lives

1088
00:40:27.013 --> 00:40:28.592
or metaphysical issues.

1089
00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:31.685
There it is, so it brings us back to experience,

1090
00:40:31.685 --> 00:40:34.554
rather than taking us out of experience into some dogma.

1091
00:40:34.554 --> 00:40:36.751
And frankly, I think that's what materialism does.

1092
00:40:36.751 --> 00:40:38.415
Here we are, as you said earlier,

1093
00:40:38.415 --> 00:40:41.381
that our experience is 100% subjective.

1094
00:40:41.381 --> 00:40:43.716
100% subjective.

1095
00:40:44.936 --> 00:40:49.060
But I appear to you as a human being and so forth,

1096
00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.086
well, really all that's here is a brain.

1097
00:40:51.086 --> 00:40:52.997
And all this here is brain chemistry,

1098
00:40:52.997 --> 00:40:56.815
and so now I'm inviting you to come out of your experience

1099
00:40:56.815 --> 00:40:59.311
to me, as a human being with your own subjective impressions

1100
00:40:59.311 --> 00:41:00.537
and so forth,

1101
00:41:00.537 --> 00:41:01.775
and say, "Well, no, if you really want to know about me,

1102
00:41:01.775 --> 00:41:04.164
just do some brain scans and take my blood type,

1103
00:41:04.164 --> 00:41:06.116
and brain chemistry, and how much EEG..."

1104
00:41:06.116 --> 00:41:08.846
It's taking you out of experience.

1105
00:41:08.846 --> 00:41:12.036
This is what I find so ironic

1106
00:41:12.036 --> 00:41:13.763
is that this whole physical world,

1107
00:41:13.763 --> 00:41:16.355
which is the ultimate thing, the only thing

1108
00:41:16.355 --> 00:41:18.329
that's really real for the materialist

1109
00:41:18.329 --> 00:41:20.771
we've never actually seen it directly.

1110
00:41:20.771 --> 00:41:23.086
As I'm gazing over at your form here,

1111
00:41:23.086 --> 00:41:25.645
what I'm getting, of course, is visual impressions.

1112
00:41:25.645 --> 00:41:28.504
If I should touch you, I'll just touch the paper,

1113
00:41:28.504 --> 00:41:29.666
it'd be something like that,

1114
00:41:29.666 --> 00:41:31.960
I'm getting tactile impressions, right?

1115
00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:34.520
I hear your voice, I've got an auditory impression.

1116
00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.855
These are called qualia, these are

1117
00:41:36.855 --> 00:41:38.647
the immediate contents of experience.

1118
00:41:38.647 --> 00:41:40.173
They're not made out of matter.

1119
00:41:40.173 --> 00:41:42.199
The colours that I see are not made

1120
00:41:42.199 --> 00:41:43.543
out of molecules or atoms,

1121
00:41:43.543 --> 00:41:45.314
their not made out of fields or particles.

1122
00:41:45.314 --> 00:41:46.593
<v Interviewer>They're still perceptions.</v>

1123
00:41:46.593 --> 00:41:48.097
<v ->No, and so this whole physical world,</v>

1124
00:41:48.097 --> 00:41:50.327
that everything's supposed to boil down to the physical,

1125
00:41:50.327 --> 00:41:54.070
it is as metaphysical as somebody believing

1126
00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:55.425
everything is the will of God.

1127
00:41:55.425 --> 00:41:57.537
But, by the way, you never see God, right?

1128
00:41:57.537 --> 00:41:59.169
This is everything boils down to matter,

1129
00:41:59.169 --> 00:42:01.035
except, by the way, you never see matter,

1130
00:42:01.035 --> 00:42:02.784
because all you ever see are the data

1131
00:42:02.784 --> 00:42:04.474
produced by your systems of measurement,

1132
00:42:04.474 --> 00:42:08.816
and, sooner or later, the buck has to come back here.

1133
00:42:08.816 --> 00:42:11.462
It has to be in terms of your own first person experience,

1134
00:42:11.462 --> 00:42:13.669
and first person experience is not material.

1135
00:42:13.669 --> 00:42:16.314
So it's really quite wonderful, you know,

1136
00:42:16.314 --> 00:42:18.287
that what they believe in so passionately

1137
00:42:18.287 --> 00:42:20.271
is as invisible to them as God is

1138
00:42:20.271 --> 00:42:21.978
to the devout religious believer.

1139
00:42:21.978 --> 00:42:25.007
And Buddhism says neither the twixt nor the twain.

1140
00:42:25.007 --> 00:42:27.450
We're not gonna load the whole burden of reality

1141
00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:28.825
on some invisible God.

1142
00:42:28.825 --> 00:42:31.407
Nor will we load the whole burden of reality

1143
00:42:31.407 --> 00:42:33.486
on some invisible physical world,

1144
00:42:33.486 --> 00:42:35.395
by the way, we define physical,

1145
00:42:35.395 --> 00:42:37.582
but rather, just come back to experience.

1146
00:42:37.582 --> 00:42:39.129
It's called, in German, the Lebenswelt,

1147
00:42:39.129 --> 00:42:42.425
the world of lived experience, the lived world.

1148
00:42:42.425 --> 00:42:44.942
And there we are, and it doesn't boil down

1149
00:42:44.942 --> 00:42:46.403
to any one category.

1150
00:42:46.403 --> 00:42:47.662
To say everything is mind?

1151
00:42:47.662 --> 00:42:49.080
I don't think so.

1152
00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.712
A kneecap is not made out of mind.

1153
00:42:50.712 --> 00:42:52.696
Clearly there are molecules there,

1154
00:42:52.696 --> 00:42:54.328
but to say, "It's only molecules,"

1155
00:42:54.328 --> 00:42:55.993
well, then what about my emotions?

1156
00:42:55.993 --> 00:42:57.314
My emotions are molecules?

1157
00:42:57.314 --> 00:42:58.573
What leap of faith do I have to make to

1158
00:42:58.573 --> 00:43:00.140
draw that conclusion?

1159
00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.858
And I'm just not in to making leaps of faith.

1160
00:43:01.858 --> 00:43:03.245
Let's just come back to experience.

1161
00:43:03.245 --> 00:43:07.447
If you follow this line in terms of Western thinking,

1162
00:43:07.447 --> 00:43:10.882
I would say I'm closest to William James.

1163
00:43:10.882 --> 00:43:12.919
A radical empiricist,

1164
00:43:12.919 --> 00:43:15.778
and he was very skeptical about materialism,

1165
00:43:15.778 --> 00:43:16.897
which, of course, I am,

1166
00:43:16.897 --> 00:43:19.457
but he was also very skeptical about religion.

1167
00:43:19.457 --> 00:43:21.707
And, to a large extent, I am as well.

1168
00:43:21.707 --> 00:43:23.605
Where I have confidence in Buddhism,

1169
00:43:23.605 --> 00:43:25.899
there was no one day where suddenly, like,

1170
00:43:25.899 --> 00:43:27.500
"I'm a believer," you know?

1171
00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.739
And then just suddenly accepted a whole bunch of doctrine.

1172
00:43:29.739 --> 00:43:32.037
That day never took place.

1173
00:43:32.037 --> 00:43:33.152
<v Interviewer>It's been a process of self discovery,</v>

1174
00:43:33.152 --> 00:43:34.560
it sounds like, for 37 years.

1175
00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:36.085
<v ->It has. It really has.
<v Interviewer>It never ends.</v>

1176
00:43:36.085 --> 00:43:37.664
<v ->I don't know if it ever will end,</v>

1177
00:43:37.664 --> 00:43:39.189
but it certainly hasn't yet.

1178
00:43:39.189 --> 00:43:41.034
And so the questing goes on.

1179
00:43:41.034 --> 00:43:43.317
A very dynamic, happy uncertainty.

1180
00:43:43.317 --> 00:43:45.279
So the question came up today,

1181
00:43:45.279 --> 00:43:47.434
it was very interesting, in the second panel,

1182
00:43:47.434 --> 00:43:50.366
about the tolerance for ambiguity and uncertainty.

1183
00:43:50.366 --> 00:43:52.532
I think that was a crucial point,

1184
00:43:52.532 --> 00:43:55.017
and I think dogmatists,

1185
00:43:55.017 --> 00:43:56.500
whether they're materialistic dogmatists

1186
00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:57.823
or religious dogmatists,

1187
00:43:57.823 --> 00:44:00.542
those people who are just absolutely confident they're right

1188
00:44:00.542 --> 00:44:03.753
and just can't even imagine that they're not.

1189
00:44:03.753 --> 00:44:07.614
Who of us can really say we know, you know?

1190
00:44:07.614 --> 00:44:10.355
With that type of absolute empirical certainty.

1191
00:44:10.355 --> 00:44:11.976
I think precious few.

1192
00:44:11.976 --> 00:44:14.067
So where is all this hubris of all this,

1193
00:44:14.067 --> 00:44:17.587
"This is just the facts, just the facts,"

1194
00:44:17.587 --> 00:44:19.389
and we have to just live with the facts,

1195
00:44:19.389 --> 00:44:20.861
whether they're depressing or not?

1196
00:44:20.861 --> 00:44:23.826
I think this is simply a character type,

1197
00:44:23.826 --> 00:44:25.330
a personality type.

1198
00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:27.197
An intolerance for ambiguity,

1199
00:44:27.197 --> 00:44:29.223
an intolerance for uncertainty,

1200
00:44:29.223 --> 00:44:33.191
and I think I have a rather large tolerance for that,

1201
00:44:33.191 --> 00:44:35.740
because I like it, because that keeps me active,

1202
00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:38.097
keeps me questing, keeps me want to engage,

1203
00:44:38.097 --> 00:44:40.017
and keeps me wanting to go-

1204
00:44:40.017 --> 00:44:41.116
<v Interviewer>Keeps you open.</v>

1205
00:44:41.116 --> 00:44:42.321
<v ->Keeps me open, and also</v>

1206
00:44:42.321 --> 00:44:44.699
it keeps me wanting to go back to the laboratory

1207
00:44:44.699 --> 00:44:46.971
of my meditation hut and explore it,

1208
00:44:46.971 --> 00:44:50.363
come back, not to you just brainwash myself

1209
00:44:50.363 --> 00:44:51.686
in Buddhist doctrine,

1210
00:44:51.686 --> 00:44:55.195
but say, "Look, I have a front row seat on my own mind."

1211
00:44:55.195 --> 00:44:57.051
States of consciousness.

1212
00:44:57.051 --> 00:44:59.792
And so I've spent about four years in solitude

1213
00:44:59.792 --> 00:45:02.149
just probing into the nature of the mind,

1214
00:45:02.149 --> 00:45:03.568
trying to explore as well as I can,

1215
00:45:03.568 --> 00:45:05.178
understand the nature of consciousness,

1216
00:45:05.178 --> 00:45:09.498
and inspired by and based upon experiences,

1217
00:45:09.498 --> 00:45:11.653
I have some pretty strong convictions now.

1218
00:45:11.653 --> 00:45:13.061
But they could be wrong.

1219
00:45:13.061 --> 00:45:14.660
But I'm not gonna just keel over

1220
00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:16.900
because a whole bunch of materialists have lined up

1221
00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:18.628
like a herd of lemmings and said,

1222
00:45:18.628 --> 00:45:21.124
"We all agree, why don't you?"

1223
00:45:21.124 --> 00:45:22.383
I say, "Well, I know you all agree,

1224
00:45:22.383 --> 00:45:23.908
"but then people have agreed on all kinds of

1225
00:45:23.908 --> 00:45:26.222
"mistaken notions over the years.

1226
00:45:26.222 --> 00:45:28.601
"Show me the empirical evidence."

1227
00:45:30.241 --> 00:45:32.119
If we want to understand something,

1228
00:45:32.119 --> 00:45:34.860
observe it carefully, and don't just observe things

1229
00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:37.110
that are somehow correlated with it.

1230
00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:41.025
Physical behaviour is correlated with mental states,

1231
00:45:41.025 --> 00:45:42.443
but they're not mental states.

1232
00:45:42.443 --> 00:45:45.600
Brain processes, neurons, dendrites, synapses and so forth,

1233
00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.830
clearly this is a great science.

1234
00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:49.675
Cognitive science is a marvellous science,

1235
00:45:49.675 --> 00:45:50.880
and they're studying things that are

1236
00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.363
correlated with mental events,

1237
00:45:52.363 --> 00:45:54.517
but they are not observing mental events directly.

1238
00:45:54.517 --> 00:45:56.629
The only people who are really good at it

1239
00:45:56.629 --> 00:45:59.125
are the ones who, like a neuroscientist has years

1240
00:45:59.125 --> 00:46:00.650
of professional training,

1241
00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:02.869
are people who have years of professional training

1242
00:46:02.869 --> 00:46:05.076
of directly observing the mind.

1243
00:46:05.076 --> 00:46:08.106
And so by the time, if that day comes

1244
00:46:08.106 --> 00:46:11.967
when professional training in the first person observation.

1245
00:46:11.967 --> 00:46:14.281
experimentation, and investigation of the mind

1246
00:46:14.281 --> 00:46:17.108
is incorporated into the modern mind sciences,

1247
00:46:17.108 --> 00:46:19.284
that's the day I'm gonna click my heels three times

1248
00:46:19.284 --> 00:46:21.673
and say, "Yippee."

1249
00:46:21.673 --> 00:46:24.254
<v ->For more on Alan's work, you can pick up a copy</v>

1250
00:46:24.254 --> 00:46:25.704
of one of his seven books,

1251
00:46:25.704 --> 00:46:27.016
including his most recent work,

1252
00:46:27.016 --> 00:46:28.872
which is "The Really Hard Problem:

1253
00:46:28.872 --> 00:46:30.942
"Meaning in a Material World".

1254
00:46:30.942 --> 00:46:32.968
You can find these through any major booksellers.

1255
00:46:32.968 --> 00:46:35.496
If you'd like to follow further strands along this line,

1256
00:46:35.496 --> 00:46:37.320
you would also likely enjoy our interviews

1257
00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.664
with Peter Russell.

1258
00:46:38.664 --> 00:46:41.160
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
