00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.090
<v ->Gregg Braden possesses a rare combination</v>

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.410
of scientific acumen and a vast knowledge

3
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.291
of ancient spiritual text.

4
00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:10.141
While researching his latest book, The God Code,

5
00:00:10.141 --> 00:00:12.201
he discovered that we are at a time in history

6
00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:14.121
where the easy lessons are passed

7
00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:16.038
and the time has come to dig deep

8
00:00:16.038 --> 00:00:17.948
and learn the big lessons now.

9
00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:19.975
He has also learned that there is a code

10
00:00:19.975 --> 00:00:22.382
embedded in ourselves that links all of us.

11
00:00:22.752 --> 00:00:24.552
He says this knowledge is a beginning

12
00:00:24.552 --> 00:00:27.092
in bridging the difficulties that separate us

13
00:00:27.092 --> 00:00:29.192
as individuals and cultures.

14
00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:33.602 line:15% 
(gentle music)

15
00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:41.132
<v ->In the last five years, I've had the opportunity</v>

16
00:00:41.132 --> 00:00:43.952
through my work, been on every continent

17
00:00:43.952 --> 00:00:45.939
of the Earth with the exception of Antarctica.

18
00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:48.909
While I have not been in every country,

19
00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:51.109
I've spoken with people from the tribes

20
00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.796
and the cultures and the traditions.

21
00:00:54.405 --> 00:00:55.948
And what I can say is almost universally there

22
00:00:55.948 --> 00:00:57.969
is a sense that we have entered into a time

23
00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:01.689
very unique unlike any other time that anyone remembers

24
00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:04.179
in the writings or in the history.

25
00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:06.570
It's characterized a number of different ways.

26
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:08.991
More often than not, people say they feel like

27
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.440
something began and it has yet to complete

28
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.381
or they're waiting for the other foot to fall,

29
00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:16.622
the other shoe to drop, is the way they feel.

30
00:01:16.622 --> 00:01:20.542
It's bigger than 9/11, it's bigger than the war in Iraq.

31
00:01:20.542 --> 00:01:24.101
Those may perhaps be symptoms of something

32
00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:27.901
but they sense a low-level anxiety,

33
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:30.231
a tension if you will,

34
00:01:30.231 --> 00:01:32.851
that something big is about to happen.

35
00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:35.191
Although we may not know it consciously that we are

36
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:38.391
in some ways preparing for whatever that is.

37
00:01:39.461 --> 00:01:41.121
<v Voiceover>How are you perceiving</v>

38
00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:43.601
what that thing is at this time?

39
00:01:43.601 --> 00:01:46.521
<v ->Well, from my perspective, I've spent the bulk</v>

40
00:01:46.521 --> 00:01:49.231
of my adult life studying and researching

41
00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:51.601
ancient text traditions, cultures, the wisdom

42
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:55.011
of those who have come before us, and they do in fact,

43
00:01:55.321 --> 00:01:57.241
the texts, some of the calendars going back

44
00:01:57.241 --> 00:02:00.411
over 18,000 years, that's before the last Ice Age,

45
00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:03.551
all point to this time in history.

46
00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:06.441
They say that we are living a very unique time.

47
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:11.651
In the words that they left for us,

48
00:02:11.651 --> 00:02:13.871
they describe the time as a time of great change

49
00:02:13.871 --> 00:02:16.192
and we've all heard about the prophecies that all converge

50
00:02:16.762 --> 00:02:18.962
in this moment in history and that doesn't mean a lot

51
00:02:18.962 --> 00:02:21.992
to someone in the West because we tend to discount those.

52
00:02:22.522 --> 00:02:23.942
Well as a scientist what I can tell you,

53
00:02:23.942 --> 00:02:26.282
as a former Earth scientist is that we are seeing

54
00:02:26.282 --> 00:02:29.022
measurable perimeters that are changing

55
00:02:29.022 --> 00:02:30.823
and appear to be converging.

56
00:02:30.823 --> 00:02:32.822
For example, the magnetic fields of the Earth

57
00:02:32.822 --> 00:02:34.402
are in rapid decline right now.

58
00:02:34.402 --> 00:02:36.892
They reached the peak about 2,000 years ago.

59
00:02:36.892 --> 00:02:38.692
They have declined consistently,

60
00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:40.392
never looked back, since then.

61
00:02:40.392 --> 00:02:42.552
We are now at the lowest magnetic point

62
00:02:42.552 --> 00:02:45.602
in global magnetics than we've been in the last 2,000 years.

63
00:02:45.602 --> 00:02:47.002
<v Voiceover>What exactly does that mean</v>

64
00:02:47.002 --> 00:02:47.942
for us as a species?

65
00:02:47.942 --> 00:02:50.412
<v ->What it means in the geologic record</v>

66
00:02:50.412 --> 00:02:53.292
we can see this has happened at least 14 times

67
00:02:53.292 --> 00:02:55.502
in the last 4 1/2 million years.

68
00:02:55.502 --> 00:02:58.542
It generally in the past has been the precursor

69
00:02:58.542 --> 00:03:01.362
to what scientists call a reversal or a flip

70
00:03:01.362 --> 00:03:02.967
in the magnetic fields of the Earth.

71
00:03:02.967 --> 00:03:04.457
Not the Earth physically,

72
00:03:05.307 --> 00:03:08.097
rather the energetic sense, the field itself,

73
00:03:09.707 --> 00:03:12.527
and it's got to be a really weird day,

74
00:03:12.527 --> 00:03:14.068
the day that this happens.

75
00:03:14.068 --> 00:03:15.728
People obviously have lived through it before,

76
00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:18.447
the Hopi have talked about it in their traditions.

77
00:03:18.447 --> 00:03:21.837
Biblical traditions talk about this and Egyptian traditions.

78
00:03:22.607 --> 00:03:24.312
What we know is that the magnetic fields

79
00:03:25.441 --> 00:03:27.191
in our bodies are very closely related,

80
00:03:27.721 --> 00:03:29.752
that a change in the magnetic fields of the Earth

81
00:03:30.391 --> 00:03:34.751
affect our dream states, people are talking

82
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:37.231
about having very, very intense, very vivid dreams.

83
00:03:37.231 --> 00:03:40.551
Sleep patterns, time and space, people feel

84
00:03:40.551 --> 00:03:43.851
that time is speeding up and there's a very good,

85
00:03:43.851 --> 00:03:48.471
excuse me, a very good, excuse me.

86
00:03:48.471 --> 00:03:49.151
<v Voiceover>Just pick it up from there.</v>

87
00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:52.055
<v ->There's a very good scientific reason</v>

88
00:03:52.055 --> 00:03:55.305
why we perceive that speeding up of time.

89
00:03:56.655 --> 00:03:57.785
So there are very--

90
00:03:57.785 --> 00:03:58.525
<v Voiceover>Can you explain that?</v>

91
00:03:58.525 --> 00:03:59.365
Because you know.

92
00:03:59.365 --> 00:04:03.325
<v ->There are very real measurable perimeters that coincide</v>

93
00:04:03.325 --> 00:04:05.382
with what the ancient text and traditions say.

94
00:04:05.732 --> 00:04:08.049
So in addition to the magnetics dropping,

95
00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.159
there's a second perimeter

96
00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.156
the Ancients call the heartbeat of the Earth.

97
00:04:12.826 --> 00:04:15.786
Scientists first measured this directly 1899,

98
00:04:15.786 --> 00:04:17.816
that's a fundamental pulse

99
00:04:17.816 --> 00:04:21.597
of about 7.8 cycles or Hertz

100
00:04:21.597 --> 00:04:24.906
per second so it's just a constant pulse.

101
00:04:24.906 --> 00:04:28.106
We believed that it was so constant it would never change.

102
00:04:28.106 --> 00:04:30.446
We built communication systems,

103
00:04:30.446 --> 00:04:33.426
we built military weaponry based on this pulse

104
00:04:33.426 --> 00:04:35.826
all up through the 1940s, 50s, 60s.

105
00:04:35.826 --> 00:04:38.506
So 1980s, 1990s, that pulse began to increase

106
00:04:38.506 --> 00:04:40.876
and what we know is that our bodies, ourselves,

107
00:04:40.876 --> 00:04:44.556
are tuned to this fundamental pulse of our Mother Earth

108
00:04:44.556 --> 00:04:49.036
as the Ancients said and that our metabolism, our bodies,

109
00:04:49.036 --> 00:04:50.954
ours rhythms, our cycles will try to match

110
00:04:50.954 --> 00:04:52.354
the pulse of the Earth.

111
00:04:52.354 --> 00:04:56.314
So as that pulse increases, to us it seems as though

112
00:04:56.314 --> 00:05:01.034
time is speeding up because we're trying to keep pace

113
00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:02.464
with that fundamental heartbeat.

114
00:05:02.834 --> 00:05:04.174
So we have these two perimeters,

115
00:05:04.174 --> 00:05:07.714
this pulse that's increasing, magnetics that are decreasing,

116
00:05:07.714 --> 00:05:11.344
and from a geologic record, it appears that when those two

117
00:05:12.314 --> 00:05:14.295
perimeters converge, that that is a time

118
00:05:14.295 --> 00:05:16.924
the Ancients called the great shift of the ages

119
00:05:16.924 --> 00:05:20.594
or the shift between the worlds.

120
00:05:21.244 --> 00:05:23.424
Native traditions say we've lived in,

121
00:05:24.334 --> 00:05:26.994
we're in the fourth of four previous worlds

122
00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:29.804
and when this world ends, we begin the fifth world.

123
00:05:30.614 --> 00:05:32.734
Mayan calendars go back over 18,000 years.

124
00:05:32.734 --> 00:05:34.234
They stop in the year 2012.

125
00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:37.894
They say beyond 2012, it will make no sense to track time

126
00:05:37.894 --> 00:05:39.394
the way you've track time in the past

127
00:05:39.394 --> 00:05:41.854
because time will mean something very different to you.

128
00:05:41.854 --> 00:05:44.254
Egyptian calendars going back over 40,000 years

129
00:05:44.664 --> 00:05:47.474
say the Earth is going through a great change right now.

130
00:05:47.474 --> 00:05:50.675
So the answer to your question, there are,

131
00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:57.125
there are reasons in the cultural history

132
00:05:57.125 --> 00:05:58.855
that point to this period in time.

133
00:05:59.245 --> 00:06:01.925
Scientists now can measure perimeters that are changing

134
00:06:01.925 --> 00:06:03.036
and they know that's happening.

135
00:06:03.036 --> 00:06:04.665
The question is what does it mean?

136
00:06:04.665 --> 00:06:05.905
So Western science is saying

137
00:06:05.905 --> 00:06:06.885
"We're seeing these things happen.

138
00:06:06.885 --> 00:06:08.305
"We don't know what it means."

139
00:06:08.305 --> 00:06:10.445
The Ancients are saying "This is what it means and this

140
00:06:10.445 --> 00:06:13.755
"is the opportunity for us to become better people."

141
00:06:14.146 --> 00:06:17.125
Because we go through this change, it will push us

142
00:06:17.975 --> 00:06:20.065
to the very edge of who we believe we are.

143
00:06:20.065 --> 00:06:23.165
It'll push the limits of our sensibilities, it will test us

144
00:06:23.165 --> 00:06:24.945
as a civilization and as a family

145
00:06:24.945 --> 00:06:26.705
like we've never been tested before.

146
00:06:27.545 --> 00:06:29.245
We will learn that we need one another

147
00:06:29.245 --> 00:06:30.985
and that is why they are pleading with us,

148
00:06:31.715 --> 00:06:34.316
the indigenous cultures, to remember our relationship

149
00:06:34.316 --> 00:06:35.736
to the Earth, to care for the Earth,

150
00:06:35.736 --> 00:06:38.245
to care for one another so that we can care for ourselves.

151
00:06:38.655 --> 00:06:42.195
If I understand the wisdom and the traditions correctly,

152
00:06:42.195 --> 00:06:44.535
it's the very act or living our lives

153
00:06:44.535 --> 00:06:45.775
in the presence of one another,

154
00:06:45.775 --> 00:06:49.235
of loving fully, intentionally, completely

155
00:06:49.235 --> 00:06:51.075
and being present and being focused,

156
00:06:51.075 --> 00:06:52.595
being the best that we can be

157
00:06:52.595 --> 00:06:54.455
by living life day in and day out.

158
00:06:54.455 --> 00:06:56.055
If we do that, by virtue of doing that,

159
00:06:56.055 --> 00:06:59.275
we have prepared in the only way that we really can

160
00:06:59.275 --> 00:07:01.445
for this time in history and here's the reason why.

161
00:07:02.176 --> 00:07:03.375
You gonna ask me the reason why? (laughs)

162
00:07:03.375 --> 00:07:04.455
<v Voiceover>Tell me the reason why.</v>

163
00:07:04.455 --> 00:07:05.315
<v ->Here's the reason why.</v>

164
00:07:05.315 --> 00:07:07.215
It's because, what scientists now tell us

165
00:07:08.325 --> 00:07:10.105
is that for every emotion, every feeling

166
00:07:10.105 --> 00:07:12.335
we have in our bodies, there's a chemistry that matches.

167
00:07:12.885 --> 00:07:15.345
So we literally have life-affirming

168
00:07:15.345 --> 00:07:17.685
or life-denying chemistries, hate chemistry,

169
00:07:17.685 --> 00:07:20.285
or love chemistry so that the anger, rage,

170
00:07:20.285 --> 00:07:21.885
and hate that we feel actually produces

171
00:07:21.885 --> 00:07:24.785
a chemistry that, it steals the life from our bodies.

172
00:07:24.785 --> 00:07:26.785
As we all intuitively know love, wisdom,

173
00:07:26.785 --> 00:07:28.865
compassion, understanding, tolerance,

174
00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:31.325
forgiveness imbues life into our bodies.

175
00:07:32.336 --> 00:07:34.875
In the process of life as we're going through

176
00:07:34.875 --> 00:07:37.135
these great tests, what we're actually doing

177
00:07:37.135 --> 00:07:39.455
is preparing ourselves in the only way

178
00:07:39.455 --> 00:07:41.655
that we would know how by living life.

179
00:07:41.655 --> 00:07:43.415
I think anyone you talk to anywhere in the world

180
00:07:43.415 --> 00:07:45.455
will say "Man, something has happened.

181
00:07:45.455 --> 00:07:46.615
"My relationships are harder

182
00:07:46.615 --> 00:07:48.005
"than they've ever been before."

183
00:07:49.295 --> 00:07:52.385
Job careers, challenges within themselves,

184
00:07:53.055 --> 00:07:55.595
their health, everyone, it's almost like

185
00:07:55.595 --> 00:07:57.795
all the fluffy easy lessons are gone

186
00:07:57.795 --> 00:07:59.415
and whatever we're going through right now,

187
00:07:59.415 --> 00:08:02.575
it's the big stuff, the core issues that really,

188
00:08:02.575 --> 00:08:04.315
although they may have been healed in the past,

189
00:08:04.315 --> 00:08:06.095
they're asking for a greater healing.

190
00:08:06.545 --> 00:08:09.445
By virtue of that, they are preparing us,

191
00:08:09.445 --> 00:08:13.905
training us if you will, so that we may better

192
00:08:13.905 --> 00:08:15.825
accommodate the changes in the world around us

193
00:08:15.825 --> 00:08:17.815
although we may not know that on a conscious level.

194
00:08:18.885 --> 00:08:20.145
<v Voiceover>So if you were speaking directly</v>

195
00:08:20.145 --> 00:08:23.125
to a 20-something disenfranchised individual

196
00:08:23.125 --> 00:08:25.925
who's cruising the net and they stumble upon you,

197
00:08:25.925 --> 00:08:27.165
they're looking for something,

198
00:08:27.165 --> 00:08:29.405
they're not feeling part of anything,

199
00:08:29.405 --> 00:08:32.237
what can you say that really prompts them

200
00:08:32.237 --> 00:08:35.742
to think and care and do or be something

201
00:08:35.742 --> 00:08:37.462
that makes a difference in the larger scale

202
00:08:37.462 --> 00:08:39.682
or even to themselves, what would you say to one--

203
00:08:39.682 --> 00:08:43.252
<v ->Well I don't know that anyone could be prompted to care.</v>

204
00:08:43.942 --> 00:08:47.212
Because that is an internal initiative.

205
00:08:47.822 --> 00:08:49.162
What I would say to them first,

206
00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:50.822
"If you're feeling disenfranchised,

207
00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:53.462
"if you're feeling disconnected and out of sorts,

208
00:08:53.462 --> 00:08:55.983
"that is perfectly normal and what I would expect

209
00:08:55.983 --> 00:08:57.072
"for this time in history."

210
00:08:57.072 --> 00:08:59.112
People feel like their world's been,

211
00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:00.782
been turned upside down.

212
00:09:01.772 --> 00:09:03.992
What science now is telling us and this ties into

213
00:09:03.992 --> 00:09:06.152
some of the work that we talked about earlier,

214
00:09:07.902 --> 00:09:11.142
Western science between 1993 and the year 2000,

215
00:09:11.142 --> 00:09:12.562
under laboratory conditions,

216
00:09:14.612 --> 00:09:17.772
established the fact and it is now a fact

217
00:09:17.772 --> 00:09:20.992
that we are all connected through a field of energy.

218
00:09:20.992 --> 00:09:23.002
We're bathed in the field of energy.

219
00:09:24.372 --> 00:09:27.852
That is the mirror, literally it provides the mirror

220
00:09:27.852 --> 00:09:30.762
of the world around us for what we have become from within.

221
00:09:31.032 --> 00:09:32.712
So if we find ourselves in this society

222
00:09:32.712 --> 00:09:35.552
that appears hateful or families that are non-supportive

223
00:09:35.552 --> 00:09:39.632
and judgmental, that world around us is nothing more,

224
00:09:39.632 --> 00:09:42.011
nothing less than what we as individuals

225
00:09:42.011 --> 00:09:44.581
and collectively have become.

226
00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:46.811
If we want to change this world,

227
00:09:46.811 --> 00:09:49.311
we must become, and this is the key,

228
00:09:49.311 --> 00:09:51.151
the ancient wisdom, we must become

229
00:09:51.151 --> 00:09:53.751
the very things that we choose to experience in life.

230
00:09:53.751 --> 00:09:57.691
If we choose love and compassion, nurturing,

231
00:09:57.691 --> 00:09:58.911
we've got to become those things.

232
00:09:58.911 --> 00:10:02.151
I've had people say to me "How can I become those

233
00:10:02.151 --> 00:10:03.511
"if I don't experience it?"

234
00:10:03.511 --> 00:10:05.151
That's the great workshop of life.

235
00:10:05.151 --> 00:10:07.811
You must choose to become and demonstrate

236
00:10:08.581 --> 00:10:11.101
and live in the world the very things

237
00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:12.621
that you'd like to experience yourself.

238
00:10:12.621 --> 00:10:16.701
In that way from within you open the door

239
00:10:16.701 --> 00:10:18.981
to the laws of the physics of this world

240
00:10:18.981 --> 00:10:20.121
that we're only beginning to understand,

241
00:10:20.121 --> 00:10:21.391
to give that back to you.

242
00:10:22.081 --> 00:10:25.071
So that I think is perhaps one of the greatest challenges.

243
00:10:25.641 --> 00:10:29.221
But those young individuals, I mean everyone's feeling it.

244
00:10:29.221 --> 00:10:31.321
There are, there is a generation that is feeling

245
00:10:31.321 --> 00:10:34.561
displaced or disenfranchised because the world

246
00:10:34.561 --> 00:10:37.231
that they're seeing makes little sense to them.

247
00:10:39.051 --> 00:10:41.091
The answers they're receiving aren't the answers

248
00:10:41.091 --> 00:10:42.241
that meet their needs.

249
00:10:42.831 --> 00:10:46.131
So in their questioning, they're going after

250
00:10:46.131 --> 00:10:48.582
in their own way, seeking their own answers.

251
00:10:49.151 --> 00:10:51.971
This is, I made reference to this in the talk earlier today.

252
00:10:51.971 --> 00:10:53.751
I had a 12-year old boy that came up to me

253
00:10:54.781 --> 00:10:57.341
in the midst of a program during one of the breaks,

254
00:10:57.341 --> 00:10:58.581
and he handed me a piece of paper

255
00:10:58.581 --> 00:11:01.311
and we just spoken about the breakdown

256
00:11:02.021 --> 00:11:03.742
of the peace process in the Middle East

257
00:11:03.742 --> 00:11:06.021
and the buildup of arms and weapons

258
00:11:06.021 --> 00:11:08.221
and the fact that one-half of the world's nations

259
00:11:08.221 --> 00:11:09.551
are at war right now.

260
00:11:09.861 --> 00:11:11.821
And this piece of paper, he printed it.

261
00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:13.861
He says "If you can't create the peace,

262
00:11:13.861 --> 00:11:16.361
"if you can't find the peace in your time."

263
00:11:16.361 --> 00:11:19.051
He said "Stop the war long enough to give us a chance."

264
00:11:19.581 --> 00:11:21.001
He didn't say "Stop the wars."

265
00:11:21.001 --> 00:11:21.841
He said "The war."

266
00:11:21.841 --> 00:11:24.351
Their sense is and so many young people feel

267
00:11:25.341 --> 00:11:26.421
that it's over anyway.

268
00:11:26.421 --> 00:11:28.881
There's a sense of hopelessness.

269
00:11:28.881 --> 00:11:30.101
That we might as well live our lives

270
00:11:30.101 --> 00:11:31.921
and do whatever we want to do now recklessly

271
00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:33.311
because it's all over.

272
00:11:34.041 --> 00:11:35.661
I hear that from people and I can understand

273
00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:39.182
why they would feel that because this is such a unique time

274
00:11:39.851 --> 00:11:41.231
in our history on the one hand.

275
00:11:41.231 --> 00:11:44.811
On the other hand, it's the time where our world

276
00:11:44.811 --> 00:11:46.871
and the people that will need us the most

277
00:11:46.871 --> 00:11:48.741
because the time where we must remember,

278
00:11:49.071 --> 00:11:50.331
the things that are important come together

279
00:11:50.331 --> 00:11:52.471
as a family, care for one another.

280
00:11:53.081 --> 00:11:56.081
Even people who are difficult to care for

281
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:58.001
and remember that there's a single field

282
00:11:58.001 --> 00:11:59.081
out there of consciousness.

283
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:01.011
There is no them and us, there is a we.

284
00:12:01.361 --> 00:12:03.801
We're part of everything, we're part of every government

285
00:12:03.801 --> 00:12:05.061
that's ever been in power,

286
00:12:05.061 --> 00:12:06.961
we're part of every atrocity that's ever happened,

287
00:12:06.961 --> 00:12:09.621
we're part of all the beautiful life and the inventions

288
00:12:09.621 --> 00:12:10.351
and all the good things.

289
00:12:10.351 --> 00:12:12.541
It's all part of that same field

290
00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:14.741
by virtue of this understanding.

291
00:12:15.391 --> 00:12:17.091
<v Voiceover>Would you say it's,</v>

292
00:12:17.091 --> 00:12:19.991
as a species it was necessary for us to become

293
00:12:19.991 --> 00:12:24.221
so disenfranchised and in disease to get to a point

294
00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:27.081
where we even understood the need for

295
00:12:27.081 --> 00:12:28.921
this paradigm shift as it were?

296
00:12:28.921 --> 00:12:30.411
<v ->Your question is as a species,</v>

297
00:12:30.411 --> 00:12:32.761
is there a need for us to be at this point.

298
00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:35.411
I believe that there is no need

299
00:12:35.411 --> 00:12:37.751
and I think it's a fascinating choice.

300
00:12:37.751 --> 00:12:39.792
I've spent a lot of time with indigenous peoples

301
00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:41.581
from throughout the Earth.

302
00:12:42.631 --> 00:12:43.971
Although they use different language,

303
00:12:43.971 --> 00:12:45.101
they all say something very similar.

304
00:12:45.101 --> 00:12:47.981
They say that there was a time

305
00:12:48.871 --> 00:12:50.871
when we lived our lives very differently

306
00:12:50.871 --> 00:12:52.512
in this world, remembered who we were

307
00:12:52.512 --> 00:12:54.511
and we lived much closer to the Earth.

308
00:12:54.511 --> 00:12:56.151
Not in the primitive state necessarily,

309
00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:59.151
we just honored life and one another.

310
00:12:59.151 --> 00:13:00.541
Something happened and they're not clear

311
00:13:00.541 --> 00:13:02.031
on what it was that happened

312
00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:03.361
and we began to forget.

313
00:13:04.311 --> 00:13:07.351
In our forgetting, we so long for the connection

314
00:13:07.351 --> 00:13:09.051
to the divine, to the feminine,

315
00:13:09.051 --> 00:13:10.551
to the masculine, to the Earth,

316
00:13:10.551 --> 00:13:12.591
to one another, to something greater.

317
00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:14.851
We so long to have that once again.

318
00:13:14.851 --> 00:13:17.611
So we embarked on a path of external technology

319
00:13:18.281 --> 00:13:21.961
in an attempt to remind ourselves

320
00:13:21.961 --> 00:13:23.411
of who we are from within.

321
00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:25.161
As an engineer and I've worked

322
00:13:26.131 --> 00:13:28.231
in engineering a good portion of my adult life,

323
00:13:28.231 --> 00:13:31.171
so amazing technology from Star Wars to the fence,

324
00:13:31.171 --> 00:13:33.721
to, you know,

325
00:13:33.721 --> 00:13:36.381
projects that are so far beyond

326
00:13:36.381 --> 00:13:38.192
where we think technology is today.

327
00:13:39.701 --> 00:13:41.381
And as advanced as all those things are,

328
00:13:41.381 --> 00:13:43.281
I can say I've never seen a piece of technology

329
00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:45.601
that humans have built that does not mimic

330
00:13:45.601 --> 00:13:48.491
something that we already are from within.

331
00:13:49.141 --> 00:13:53.381
What we know, Western science will tell us

332
00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:57.181
that every cell in our body has about 1.17 volts

333
00:13:57.181 --> 00:13:58.541
of electrical potential.

334
00:13:58.541 --> 00:14:01.741
So you take 50 trillion cells times 1.17 volts

335
00:14:01.741 --> 00:14:04.101
and there's a lot of potential, lot of juice there.

336
00:14:04.101 --> 00:14:08.241
Every cell is a capacitor, it transmits, it receives,

337
00:14:08.241 --> 00:14:11.171
stores information, all the things our technology do.

338
00:14:12.601 --> 00:14:14.461
What my indigenous friends and what the Ancients

339
00:14:14.461 --> 00:14:16.361
say to us is we will continue to build

340
00:14:16.361 --> 00:14:19.661
a very complex world of greater and greater complexity

341
00:14:19.661 --> 00:14:21.721
out there is the world around us,

342
00:14:21.721 --> 00:14:23.841
until we remember that we are those things

343
00:14:23.841 --> 00:14:26.391
and then we no longer need those because we become,

344
00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:29.241
we become the very things that we've built.

345
00:14:29.241 --> 00:14:30.841
In that way we find our way back.

346
00:14:30.841 --> 00:14:34.301
So it's interesting that it asks the question

347
00:14:34.301 --> 00:14:37.201
when we see civilizations of our past,

348
00:14:37.201 --> 00:14:39.671
that we think are primitive because they don't have a VCR

349
00:14:40.341 --> 00:14:41.851
or a toaster for example.

350
00:14:42.401 --> 00:14:44.041
Were they really primitive or were they so advanced

351
00:14:44.041 --> 00:14:45.501
that they didn't have the need

352
00:14:45.501 --> 00:14:47.958
for the kinds of things that we have today?

353
00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.938
It's a question that's being taken seriously

354
00:14:49.938 --> 00:14:53.768
by a lot of archaeologists, anthropologists today.

355
00:14:54.578 --> 00:14:58.118
So as we find our way, it's an interesting path.

356
00:14:58.118 --> 00:15:00.665
Because what has happened is when we were lost,

357
00:15:01.955 --> 00:15:04.775
some of us chose this path of external technology

358
00:15:04.775 --> 00:15:08.092
and now we've pushed it about as far as we can

359
00:15:09.902 --> 00:15:12.422
and to survive now we've got to come back

360
00:15:12.422 --> 00:15:15.662
and bring in the other portion, the internal technology,

361
00:15:15.662 --> 00:15:17.412
the wisdom of our relationship,

362
00:15:17.842 --> 00:15:19.942
the power of human emotion

363
00:15:19.942 --> 00:15:22.419
and the role that it plays in the physics of our world,

364
00:15:23.129 --> 00:15:24.802
it is perhaps as the Ancients said,

365
00:15:24.802 --> 00:15:26.946
the single most powerful force in the universe.

366
00:15:26.946 --> 00:15:31.056
Human emotion focused is very specific modalities of prayer.

367
00:15:31.426 --> 00:15:33.433
Western physicists are only beginning to understand this.

368
00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:35.933
They thought we were observers and now they're saying

369
00:15:35.933 --> 00:15:38.613
"We're not observers, we by the act of being here,

370
00:15:38.613 --> 00:15:43.373
"we are participating, we're creating the world

371
00:15:43.373 --> 00:15:45.180
"that we're seeing right now."

372
00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.980
There's a school of physics now that suggests

373
00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.700
that the universe in fact is here and exists

374
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.847
because we're looking.

375
00:15:53.637 --> 00:15:55.857
And what they found is that every place

376
00:15:55.857 --> 00:15:59.297
human consciousness seeks or peers

377
00:15:59.677 --> 00:16:01.774
to see and investigate what's there,

378
00:16:02.465 --> 00:16:05.157
the act of looking is an internal process

379
00:16:05.157 --> 00:16:06.597
and consciousness will place something

380
00:16:06.597 --> 00:16:07.994
there for us to see.

381
00:16:07.994 --> 00:16:09.751
They say we'll never find the end of the universe.

382
00:16:10.121 --> 00:16:12.331
We'll never find it because every place we look,

383
00:16:12.331 --> 00:16:14.743
consciousness as the creator, will put something there.

384
00:16:16.033 --> 00:16:17.534
It is these kinds of understandings

385
00:16:17.534 --> 00:16:20.163
that are bringing science and physics back full circle.

386
00:16:20.613 --> 00:16:22.494
To tie in this outer and this inner technology

387
00:16:22.494 --> 00:16:25.593
saying you know, maybe we have something to say

388
00:16:25.593 --> 00:16:28.293
and something to do about the peace in our world

389
00:16:28.293 --> 00:16:29.573
and the healing in our bodies.

390
00:16:29.573 --> 00:16:31.683
Maybe it's not just a random process.

391
00:16:32.553 --> 00:16:36.300
That's where the power of our inner technology begins.

392
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.486
<v Voiceover>You wrote a book called The Isaiah Effect,</v>

393
00:16:38.486 --> 00:16:41.025
speaking about the collective consciousness

394
00:16:41.025 --> 00:16:43.166
when focused properly through the emotions,

395
00:16:43.166 --> 00:16:44.925
the amount that can be accomplished

396
00:16:44.925 --> 00:16:48.382
with really a relatively few, small number of people.

397
00:16:48.653 --> 00:16:51.473
Can you just encapsulate that very briefly for people?

398
00:16:51.473 --> 00:16:52.852
<v ->Sure, the investigations,</v>

399
00:16:52.852 --> 00:16:54.556
well first of all these are not new ideas.

400
00:16:55.067 --> 00:16:59.306
The idea that we are connected through a field of energy

401
00:16:59.306 --> 00:17:01.846
has been around forever, thousands of years.

402
00:17:01.846 --> 00:17:04.697
What's new is the scientific validation of the field.

403
00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:06.987
And scientists now coming to terms,

404
00:17:06.987 --> 00:17:08.686
"Okay the field's there, what do we do with it?

405
00:17:08.686 --> 00:17:11.297
"How connected are we really to this field?"

406
00:17:11.826 --> 00:17:14.287
It led to a series of experiments back in 1970s

407
00:17:14.287 --> 00:17:16.723
and the TM people, Transcendental Meditation,

408
00:17:17.332 --> 00:17:20.352
university backed and funded and pulled in

409
00:17:20.352 --> 00:17:22.720
some very good scientists to do some of these fields.

410
00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:27.340
What they found was they had 24 cities

411
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.379
in the United States with populations over 10,000 people

412
00:17:30.379 --> 00:17:31.586
and they did experiments.

413
00:17:31.586 --> 00:17:36.376
Scientifically governed experiments.

414
00:17:37.972 --> 00:17:39.213
They would take a certain number of people

415
00:17:39.213 --> 00:17:43.380
and ask them to feel the feeling of peace, for example,

416
00:17:43.849 --> 00:17:46.229
not to think the thought but rather to feel the feeling

417
00:17:46.229 --> 00:17:48.379
in their bodies for certain periods of time.

418
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:51.010
What they found was during those periods of time,

419
00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.649
statistically the communities around them changed.

420
00:17:53.649 --> 00:17:56.270
Crimes against people declined, violent crimes.

421
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.450
Emergency hospital room visits declined,

422
00:17:58.450 --> 00:17:59.946
traffic accidents declined.

423
00:18:00.976 --> 00:18:02.376
In cities where the stock market was,

424
00:18:02.376 --> 00:18:04.633
the stock market soared when this was happening.

425
00:18:05.203 --> 00:18:07.723
When the people stopped feeling the peace,

426
00:18:07.723 --> 00:18:09.274
all those statistics reversed.

427
00:18:09.784 --> 00:18:12.230
This led to a greater experiment.

428
00:18:13.039 --> 00:18:14.540
It was called the International Peace Project

429
00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.360
in the Middle East, it was during the Lebanese war

430
00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.266
with Israel in the early 1980s.

431
00:18:19.016 --> 00:18:21.295
They had people that were strategically placed

432
00:18:21.295 --> 00:18:25.596
in the war zones and during the window of time,

433
00:18:25.596 --> 00:18:27.495
it's called the prayer window,

434
00:18:27.495 --> 00:18:29.875
when the people were feeling the peace in their bodies,

435
00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:31.335
terrorist activities dropped to zero,

436
00:18:31.335 --> 00:18:32.485
they completely stopped.

437
00:18:32.936 --> 00:18:33.876
All the other things happened,

438
00:18:33.876 --> 00:18:35.695
crimes against people, violent crimes,

439
00:18:35.695 --> 00:18:38.665
emergency hospital room visits all declined.

440
00:18:39.156 --> 00:18:40.375
And they tried these, just to make sure

441
00:18:40.375 --> 00:18:41.876
it wasn't maybe the time of the month

442
00:18:41.876 --> 00:18:43.742
or full moon cycles or holidays,

443
00:18:43.742 --> 00:18:45.421
they tried them all different times,

444
00:18:45.998 --> 00:18:48.583
double blind studies, statistically valid studies,

445
00:18:49.213 --> 00:18:51.714
what they found was it takes a relatively few

446
00:18:51.714 --> 00:18:56.293
number of people to jump start this experience

447
00:18:56.293 --> 00:18:57.473
and consciousness and the number

448
00:18:57.473 --> 00:19:00.893
is the square root of 1% which is a very small number.

449
00:19:00.893 --> 00:19:03.413
So if you take a population, whether it's 10 people

450
00:19:03.413 --> 00:19:08.003
or a million, and you take 1% of that in your calculator

451
00:19:08.413 --> 00:19:09.813
and then you take the square root of that,

452
00:19:09.813 --> 00:19:11.933
it'll tell you how many people that you need.

453
00:19:11.933 --> 00:19:14.073
So in a city of one million people, for example,

454
00:19:14.073 --> 00:19:17.813
it only takes about 100 or in a world of six billion people,

455
00:19:17.813 --> 00:19:21.663
it only takes about 8,000 to jump start this effect.

456
00:19:22.123 --> 00:19:23.763
Obviously the more people that participate,

457
00:19:23.763 --> 00:19:25.513
the more accelerated the effect.

458
00:19:27.523 --> 00:19:29.984
As empowering as the discovery of a message

459
00:19:29.984 --> 00:19:31.997
within the cells of all life is,

460
00:19:32.707 --> 00:19:34.807
what may be even more significant

461
00:19:34.807 --> 00:19:38.527
is that the only way we could ever unravel the mystery

462
00:19:38.527 --> 00:19:41.925
and decode a language in the DNA of life,

463
00:19:41.925 --> 00:19:43.835
we haven't talked even about what this language is yet,

464
00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:46.405
the only way we could do that is to cross

465
00:19:46.405 --> 00:19:48.925
the artificial boundaries, the traditional boundaries,

466
00:19:48.925 --> 00:19:50.985
that have kept us separate from our world

467
00:19:50.985 --> 00:19:52.165
now for over 400 years.

468
00:19:52.165 --> 00:19:54.162
Science is only about 400 years old.

469
00:19:54.892 --> 00:19:56.752
When science came along, and I'm a scientist

470
00:19:56.752 --> 00:19:58.472
and I support the scientific method,

471
00:19:58.472 --> 00:20:00.731
and the best scientists will tell you

472
00:20:00.731 --> 00:20:02.632
that our science is incomplete.

473
00:20:02.632 --> 00:20:04.169
What science came along, it did,

474
00:20:04.169 --> 00:20:06.709
was it came along and compartmentalized

475
00:20:06.709 --> 00:20:10.409
and separated what is actually all unified together.

476
00:20:10.409 --> 00:20:12.889
There is no physics and chemistry and biology

477
00:20:12.889 --> 00:20:14.569
and geology out there.

478
00:20:14.569 --> 00:20:16.246
There's a world, we call it nature.

479
00:20:17.136 --> 00:20:19.993
To help us feel comfortable with the complexity of nature,

480
00:20:20.883 --> 00:20:23.140
they compartmentalize it into sciences now

481
00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:26.947
to such a degree that when a physicist studies physics,

482
00:20:27.917 --> 00:20:29.217
we no longer know that that physics

483
00:20:29.217 --> 00:20:32.127
has any relation to perhaps chemistry.

484
00:20:32.537 --> 00:20:34.217
Or when I was working on this project,

485
00:20:34.217 --> 00:20:37.297
the linguist told me no one, no one ever said

486
00:20:37.297 --> 00:20:39.544
that language had anything to do with life

487
00:20:40.294 --> 00:20:44.624
or that biology had anything to do with ancient texts.

488
00:20:46.054 --> 00:20:48.854
It was only by crossing those traditional boundaries,

489
00:20:48.854 --> 00:20:51.574
honoring the wisdom of our past, that we were able

490
00:20:51.574 --> 00:20:53.961
to come to the understandings that we did.

491
00:20:53.961 --> 00:20:57.461
What that understanding is, it's a research project

492
00:20:57.461 --> 00:21:00.561
that I began as an engineer back in the late 1980s,

493
00:21:00.561 --> 00:21:02.588
during the last years of the Cold War,

494
00:21:03.918 --> 00:21:07.515
looking for a single principle of peace

495
00:21:08.185 --> 00:21:09.665
that would include every human

496
00:21:09.665 --> 00:21:12.585
on the face of the Earth, regardless of their beliefs

497
00:21:12.585 --> 00:21:14.795
or their lifestyle or their heritage or their culture.

498
00:21:15.665 --> 00:21:17.645
Something that was common to everyone

499
00:21:17.645 --> 00:21:19.282
and it made sense in the 1980s,

500
00:21:19.282 --> 00:21:20.702
this was before the Genome Project

501
00:21:20.702 --> 00:21:21.812
or any of these things happened,

502
00:21:22.222 --> 00:21:24.722
to look at DNA in the cells of our bodies

503
00:21:25.412 --> 00:21:28.592
and following the clues that were left in the ancient texts,

504
00:21:28.592 --> 00:21:30.292
all I did was follow them step-by-step

505
00:21:30.292 --> 00:21:33.352
and the clues said that within your body

506
00:21:33.352 --> 00:21:35.832
is a language and here is the way that language works.

507
00:21:35.832 --> 00:21:39.232
What we now know is that the DNA in our bodies,

508
00:21:39.232 --> 00:21:41.573
the elements that we call DNA,

509
00:21:42.062 --> 00:21:46.602
literally are linked to the letters of ancient alphabets

510
00:21:46.602 --> 00:21:50.562
in very precise ways and when we make those translations,

511
00:21:50.562 --> 00:21:52.682
when the chemicals become the letters,

512
00:21:52.682 --> 00:21:54.542
lo and behold the letters start to spell words

513
00:21:54.542 --> 00:21:56.182
and the words start to spell sentences

514
00:21:56.182 --> 00:21:57.792
and the sentences have meaning.

515
00:21:58.922 --> 00:22:02.112
It appears that the message in our cells

516
00:22:02.112 --> 00:22:03.852
exists as many, many, layers.

517
00:22:04.662 --> 00:22:06.202
What we've done is crack the code

518
00:22:06.202 --> 00:22:07.672
for only the very first layer.

519
00:22:08.202 --> 00:22:09.622
It took 12 years to do it.

520
00:22:09.622 --> 00:22:11.122
It's a very brief message

521
00:22:11.122 --> 00:22:13.662
and it literally translates, literally says

522
00:22:13.662 --> 00:22:15.662
to us when we look at the DNA,

523
00:22:15.662 --> 00:22:17.162
the upper most level of the DNA,

524
00:22:17.162 --> 00:22:20.162
the four DNA bases, the building blocks of all life,

525
00:22:20.162 --> 00:22:24.352
it literally says the words "God eternal within the body.

526
00:22:24.862 --> 00:22:26.662
"God eternal within the body."

527
00:22:26.662 --> 00:22:30.302
And the complexity of life from a single yeast cell

528
00:22:30.302 --> 00:22:32.742
to the complexity of a human

529
00:22:32.742 --> 00:22:35.522
and everything in between appears to be different

530
00:22:35.522 --> 00:22:39.402
combinations of these elements.

531
00:22:39.402 --> 00:22:42.062
So a scientist will say they're different combinations

532
00:22:42.062 --> 00:22:44.353
of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen,

533
00:22:44.353 --> 00:22:47.422
and they're correct by virtue of our language today.

534
00:22:47.772 --> 00:22:49.582
The Ancients didn't know about those words.

535
00:22:50.012 --> 00:22:51.432
They looked at it differently and they said

536
00:22:51.432 --> 00:22:53.932
"They're different combinations of the words

537
00:22:53.932 --> 00:22:55.412
"God eternal within the body."

538
00:22:55.412 --> 00:22:56.962
And they're correct as well.

539
00:22:57.292 --> 00:22:59.432
Two different ways of describing our world.

540
00:22:59.882 --> 00:23:01.632
Very different periods of time.

541
00:23:02.122 --> 00:23:05.602
<v Voiceover>So for this one top layer discovery,</v>

542
00:23:05.602 --> 00:23:07.742
what is the implication at this point in history?

543
00:23:07.742 --> 00:23:10.542
<v ->The implication for me searching for a principle</v>

544
00:23:10.542 --> 00:23:12.112
of peace, there are many implications.

545
00:23:13.622 --> 00:23:16.192
I've had people ask me "Well why don't you

546
00:23:16.922 --> 00:23:18.822
"take on the evolutionary biologist?

547
00:23:18.822 --> 00:23:20.703
"Why don't you take on the theologians?"

548
00:23:21.694 --> 00:23:23.513
And we could with this kind of information

549
00:23:23.513 --> 00:23:26.053
but that wasn't the purpose for me.

550
00:23:26.053 --> 00:23:29.303
I'll let other people take those things to task.

551
00:23:30.113 --> 00:23:32.663
My purpose was to find a single principle of peace.

552
00:23:33.813 --> 00:23:36.413
What this message says to us, three things.

553
00:23:36.413 --> 00:23:37.953
It says beyond a shadow of a doubt,

554
00:23:37.953 --> 00:23:40.163
we're here on purpose, it's an intentional code.

555
00:23:40.613 --> 00:23:43.953
We don't know who put it there, God eternal within the body.

556
00:23:43.953 --> 00:23:45.993
We don't know who God is or what God is.

557
00:23:46.623 --> 00:23:49.603
It's interesting however that the word God in our bodies

558
00:23:49.603 --> 00:23:53.123
matches the word that we find in 2,200-year old text.

559
00:23:53.123 --> 00:23:55.213
Like the Dead Sea Scrolls, it's the same name.

560
00:23:57.203 --> 00:23:58.733
It tells us we're here on purpose.

561
00:23:59.244 --> 00:24:01.283
It tells us that we're part of one another

562
00:24:02.173 --> 00:24:04.144
in all life that shares that message.

563
00:24:04.144 --> 00:24:08.183
So any form of life where the code can be translated,

564
00:24:08.183 --> 00:24:10.653
God eternal within the body, it says they're part of us

565
00:24:10.653 --> 00:24:11.663
and we're part of them.

566
00:24:12.093 --> 00:24:15.033
And because this code exists even in ancient forms of life

567
00:24:15.033 --> 00:24:17.183
where we've been able to glean DNA,

568
00:24:17.933 --> 00:24:20.273
in single-celled organisms for example,

569
00:24:20.273 --> 00:24:22.373
it says whoever put that code there

570
00:24:22.373 --> 00:24:24.773
existed before those primitive organisms.

571
00:24:24.773 --> 00:24:26.793
So it suggests that we are part of perhaps

572
00:24:26.793 --> 00:24:29.203
something much greater than we've ever imagined.

573
00:24:29.753 --> 00:24:30.963
Now you can read a lot into that.

574
00:24:31.453 --> 00:24:34.043
Scientifically we can't say what that something is.

575
00:24:34.043 --> 00:24:36.204
All we can say is there's a code there,

576
00:24:36.204 --> 00:24:39.013
it's intentional, it links all life.

577
00:24:39.643 --> 00:24:43.123
For me, what it says to us as I travel the world

578
00:24:43.123 --> 00:24:44.233
and I meet these people,

579
00:24:45.583 --> 00:24:47.484
people are ready for peace.

580
00:24:47.484 --> 00:24:50.443
They need a reason to look at one another differently

581
00:24:50.443 --> 00:24:53.543
and so many parts of the world, the hatred is so strong

582
00:24:53.543 --> 00:24:55.533
because of what has happened between peoples.

583
00:24:56.323 --> 00:24:59.463
They need a reason to see themselves differently

584
00:24:59.463 --> 00:25:01.343
and if we were ever going to find a reason,

585
00:25:02.133 --> 00:25:05.833
I think the name of God, the same name within the cells

586
00:25:05.833 --> 00:25:08.853
of all humans, it gives us a place to begin.

587
00:25:08.853 --> 00:25:12.993
It gives us a common plateau, a denominator.

588
00:25:12.993 --> 00:25:15.894
It says at this very level what we can say is

589
00:25:15.894 --> 00:25:17.004
we're not so different.

590
00:25:17.314 --> 00:25:18.114
It says that.

591
00:25:18.114 --> 00:25:19.924
It says that for us at the very least.

592
00:25:20.614 --> 00:25:22.014
Someone asked me, I was doing an interview,

593
00:25:22.014 --> 00:25:24.694
a radio interview a few weeks ago and they said

594
00:25:24.694 --> 00:25:26.594
"Well do you think this is going to change the world?"

595
00:25:26.594 --> 00:25:29.214
And I said "Realistically it's not

596
00:25:29.214 --> 00:25:30.454
"going to change the world.

597
00:25:30.454 --> 00:25:32.484
"It's a place to begin, it gives us a reason."

598
00:25:33.034 --> 00:25:36.154
I think it's something, I've got to tell you as a scientist,

599
00:25:37.904 --> 00:25:40.684
the idea of looking at DNA as a language

600
00:25:40.684 --> 00:25:43.365
is a bizarre, a bizarre concept.

601
00:25:43.365 --> 00:25:45.904
A language that we can actually read, this alphabet,

602
00:25:45.904 --> 00:25:48.474
it's been called the language of life since the 1950s

603
00:25:48.474 --> 00:25:51.394
as a metaphor without perhaps knowing how close

604
00:25:51.394 --> 00:25:54.754
that metaphor really is to what has happened.

605
00:25:54.754 --> 00:25:57.074
<v Voiceover>Did I understand or misunderstand you</v>

606
00:25:57.074 --> 00:25:59.114
when you were saying that that is not true just in

607
00:25:59.114 --> 00:26:03.294
the Ancient Hebrew but also in other ancient languages?

608
00:26:03.294 --> 00:26:05.784
<v ->Well, it is true in other languages.</v>

609
00:26:06.834 --> 00:26:08.635
In the year 2000, there was a census

610
00:26:08.635 --> 00:26:09.425
that was done on the Earth.

611
00:26:09.425 --> 00:26:12.755
It's believed to be the most accurate census ever done.

612
00:26:13.165 --> 00:26:15.235
It told us some very interesting things.

613
00:26:15.235 --> 00:26:18.465
First of all it said there was about 6.2 billion of us

614
00:26:18.465 --> 00:26:19.795
on this planet right now.

615
00:26:20.665 --> 00:26:22.355
That number is so big I don't even know what it looks like.

616
00:26:23.545 --> 00:26:25.605
But it said of that 6.2 billion people,

617
00:26:25.605 --> 00:26:30.085
over 95% of the people of the Earth believe in the existence

618
00:26:30.085 --> 00:26:31.285
of a higher power

619
00:26:31.655 --> 00:26:35.905
and of that 95%, over one-half call that power God.

620
00:26:36.935 --> 00:26:39.406
So if we were ever going to find a single principle

621
00:26:40.335 --> 00:26:44.465
of peace that touches the most people in the deepest way.

622
00:26:44.855 --> 00:26:48.095
If we could find a principle that is tied

623
00:26:48.095 --> 00:26:50.465
to the already existing spiritual traditions,

624
00:26:50.465 --> 00:26:52.096
I think that's a good place to begin.

625
00:26:53.005 --> 00:26:56.025
So what we know now, half of the 95% believe

626
00:26:56.025 --> 00:26:57.685
and actually call the power God.

627
00:26:59.075 --> 00:27:02.235
The Ancient Hebrew language is the language

628
00:27:02.235 --> 00:27:06.015
that holds the oldest records for the spiritual traditions

629
00:27:06.015 --> 00:27:07.925
of over half of the world's population.

630
00:27:08.475 --> 00:27:12.515
One billion Islamic and two billion Judeo-Christian,

631
00:27:12.515 --> 00:27:16.555
three billion people are linked to the Old Testament,

632
00:27:16.555 --> 00:27:18.705
the Book of Genesis, and the Torah,

633
00:27:19.795 --> 00:27:22.495
and what subsequently became the Quran,

634
00:27:22.495 --> 00:27:24.825
all linked through the prophet Abraham.

635
00:27:25.535 --> 00:27:28.885
The oldest records of Abraham are in the Hebrew language.

636
00:27:29.295 --> 00:27:32.055
So it made sense to me to use Hebrew first,

637
00:27:32.055 --> 00:27:35.375
to translate life in our bodies into an ancient language.

638
00:27:35.375 --> 00:27:37.905
It's called a root or a mother or a core language.

639
00:27:38.675 --> 00:27:41.515
Once it was done, and Hebrew, biblical Hebrew

640
00:27:41.515 --> 00:27:43.815
lends itself to this kind of work,

641
00:27:43.815 --> 00:27:46.255
one it was done in that language,

642
00:27:46.255 --> 00:27:47.985
I then began to look at other languages.

643
00:27:47.985 --> 00:27:51.175
We know for certain it works in Ancient Arabic as well.

644
00:27:52.025 --> 00:27:53.805
It may, looks like it works in Sanskrit,

645
00:27:53.805 --> 00:27:55.805
although it's not, that work is not complete

646
00:27:55.805 --> 00:27:58.905
so I cannot say definitively, and if it does,

647
00:27:58.905 --> 00:28:01.525
what that means is in addition to the Hebrew,

648
00:28:01.525 --> 00:28:03.765
it's the basis for over half the world's population

649
00:28:03.765 --> 00:28:08.485
if it's in Sanskrit, it's the basis for Hindu

650
00:28:08.485 --> 00:28:09.915
and for many of the Buddhist's traditions.

651
00:28:10.445 --> 00:28:12.625
We've reached a lot of people in a language

652
00:28:12.625 --> 00:28:15.795
that makes sense to them with a very empowering message.

653
00:28:16.565 --> 00:28:19.905
I'm an optimist and as I've had the opportunity

654
00:28:19.905 --> 00:28:21.745
to travel the Earth and meet with people,

655
00:28:21.745 --> 00:28:26.205
I have a great faith in our species, in our destiny.

656
00:28:26.935 --> 00:28:29.595
I think it's a tribute to our species

657
00:28:29.595 --> 00:28:33.255
that we have each carried a message

658
00:28:33.255 --> 00:28:34.935
from the first day of our existence,

659
00:28:34.935 --> 00:28:37.255
perfectly replicated in every cell of our bodies,

660
00:28:38.005 --> 00:28:40.545
and it gives us a reason to become better people

661
00:28:40.545 --> 00:28:41.845
and to create a better world.

662
00:28:41.845 --> 00:28:43.835
I love this world and I love the people of this world.

663
00:28:44.785 --> 00:28:48.325
I appreciate you and your vision and your dedication

664
00:28:48.325 --> 00:28:51.125
for helping us to take this message to a broader audience.

665
00:28:51.125 --> 00:28:52.285
So thank you very much.

666
00:28:52.285 --> 00:28:53.485
(gentle music)

667
00:28:53.485 --> 00:28:54.795
<v ->To learn more about this subject,</v>

668
00:28:54.795 --> 00:28:57.275
you might want to pick up a copy of The God Code.

669
00:28:57.275 --> 00:29:00.795
Meanwhile another sage we find to be equally inspirational

670
00:29:00.795 --> 00:29:04.055
is eco-philosopher extraordinaire, Peter Russell.

671
00:29:04.055 --> 00:29:05.805
Until next time, thanks for watching.

672
00:29:05.805 --> 00:29:09.855
(gentle music)
