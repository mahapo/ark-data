00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.442
<v ->As a doctor of gastroenterology,</v>

2
00:00:03.442 --> 00:00:06.526
Dr. Becky Natrajan spent years watching

3
00:00:06.526 --> 00:00:08.535
as her patients' health deteriorated

4
00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:10.947
into one chronic disorder after another,

5
00:00:10.947 --> 00:00:13.101
in spite of doing everything she knew to do

6
00:00:13.101 --> 00:00:14.775
as an MD to help them.

7
00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:16.748
One particularly frustrating patient

8
00:00:16.748 --> 00:00:18.881
returned after a year's absence,

9
00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:21.421
looking slim, vibrant and young.

10
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.437
Becky didn't believe it was the same woman

11
00:00:23.437 --> 00:00:25.406
and asked her what she had done.

12
00:00:25.406 --> 00:00:26.654
She was so struck by the story

13
00:00:26.654 --> 00:00:29.097
that she made a decision to educate herself

14
00:00:29.097 --> 00:00:32.062
as to what was really needed to heal her patients.

15
00:00:32.062 --> 00:00:34.782
Today, she's giving up her booming medical practice

16
00:00:34.782 --> 00:00:37.176
and dedicating her life to helping the people

17
00:00:37.176 --> 00:00:40.700
who once knew her as the Butts and Guts Doctor.

18
00:00:41.217 --> 00:00:44.709
(soft, upbeat music)

19
00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:52.144
<v Voiceover>About 20 years ago,</v>

20
00:00:52.144 --> 00:00:54.607
I was in the Black Forest with, at that time,

21
00:00:54.607 --> 00:00:56.574
a fairly well-known physicist who was in to

22
00:00:56.574 --> 00:00:58.579
a lot of leading-edge healing modalities,

23
00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.808
and he said to me, in the interview,

24
00:01:00.808 --> 00:01:04.046
the most important thing in the body is digestion.

25
00:01:04.046 --> 00:01:06.885
All illness stems from the health,

26
00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:09.552
or lack of, of digestion.

27
00:01:09.552 --> 00:01:11.419
And you know about this better than

28
00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:12.916
probably just about anybody.

29
00:01:12.916 --> 00:01:13.796
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

30
00:01:13.796 --> 00:01:16.142
<v Voiceover>As a gastroenterologist, you've kinda seen</v>

31
00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:18.268
everything up one end and down the other.

32
00:01:18.627 --> 00:01:22.552
And, just on that statement alone, what is the truth,

33
00:01:22.552 --> 00:01:25.511
the real nugget of truth in that statement he made?

34
00:01:25.964 --> 00:01:28.492
<v ->Well, the root of all of our internal problems</v>

35
00:01:28.492 --> 00:01:31.111
definitely stems from what goes into our bodies.

36
00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:32.669
And we talk about digestion,

37
00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:34.290
what you drink and what you eat

38
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.476
has a direct effect on all your vital organs.

39
00:01:36.476 --> 00:01:37.990
It affects your liver, your kidneys,

40
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.946
your vascular system, your lymphatics.

41
00:01:39.946 --> 00:01:43.882
In today's world, I mean our digestion is so messed up

42
00:01:43.882 --> 00:01:47.946
because of all of the different foods and products out there

43
00:01:47.946 --> 00:01:49.920
that are just not allowing our bodies

44
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.816
to have the right nutrients.

45
00:01:51.816 --> 00:01:53.687
We're eating foods that are causing

46
00:01:53.687 --> 00:01:55.778
our bodies to clog, basically.

47
00:01:55.778 --> 00:01:57.399
We're not absorbing well.

48
00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.233
A lot of the foods are just causing us to be

49
00:01:59.233 --> 00:02:00.866
more and more nutritionally bankrupt.

50
00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:04.049
And so you have digestive diseases that stem

51
00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.138
from what we're ingesting in today's world,

52
00:02:06.138 --> 00:02:07.518
which is a lot of poisons, basically.

53
00:02:07.518 --> 00:02:08.382
<v Voiceover>A lot of poisons.</v>

54
00:02:08.382 --> 00:02:10.189
Can you give us the main culprits?

55
00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:11.970
<v ->Well, just think about fruits and vegetables.</v>

56
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.809
I mean, on average, you have 72 insecticides and pesticides,

57
00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:17.059
these poisons, on fruits and vegetables.

58
00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:19.704
So you're eating these poisons

59
00:02:19.704 --> 00:02:20.931
and they're coming into the system

60
00:02:20.931 --> 00:02:22.978
and the body's built to be a natural detoxifier,

61
00:02:22.978 --> 00:02:24.710
but it has a hard time when it becomes very clogged

62
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.049
with all of these poisons.

63
00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.964
Now, think about our meats, chicken, you know,

64
00:02:29.964 --> 00:02:33.653
and all the injections of antibiotics and steroids.

65
00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:35.712
So, additional poisons that go into these foods and,

66
00:02:35.712 --> 00:02:37.370
you know, we're ingesting these foods,

67
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.995
but our children are ingesting these poisons.

68
00:02:39.995 --> 00:02:41.690
And so, you know, we see a lot of

69
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.261
pediatric GI illness nowadays.

70
00:02:44.261 --> 00:02:46.116
Children with irritable bowel, you know,

71
00:02:46.116 --> 00:02:46.814
terrible gas.

72
00:02:46.814 --> 00:02:47.875
<v Voiceover>That didn't happen when we were kids.</v>

73
00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:48.622
<v ->Never did.</v>

74
00:02:48.622 --> 00:02:50.124
And it has everything to do with, you know,

75
00:02:50.124 --> 00:02:52.492
these toxins coming into the body,

76
00:02:52.492 --> 00:02:54.636
wreaking havoc with our digestive system,

77
00:02:54.636 --> 00:02:55.905
and you have children that are seeing

78
00:02:55.905 --> 00:02:57.900
pediatric gastrointestinal specialists,

79
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.244
having colonoscopies at ages four, five and six

80
00:03:01.244 --> 00:03:02.331
because they've got gas and bloating,

81
00:03:02.331 --> 00:03:04.817
they're constipated or chronic diarrhea,

82
00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:07.749
and now we see a whole increase in

83
00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:09.094
inflammatory bowel disorders,

84
00:03:09.094 --> 00:03:10.970
like ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

85
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.295
Again, a lot of these disorders are linked

86
00:03:13.295 --> 00:03:16.100
to all of these toxins that come in to our body

87
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.089
via what we're drinking, what we're eating.

88
00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:19.785
I mean, just think about the water supply.

89
00:03:19.785 --> 00:03:21.342
Over 500 different chemicals that have been

90
00:03:21.342 --> 00:03:23.198
isolated in our water supply,

91
00:03:23.198 --> 00:03:26.408
and even if you drink filtered or distilled water,

92
00:03:26.408 --> 00:03:29.677
you are bathing a lot of times in water that's poisonous.

93
00:03:29.677 --> 00:03:30.947
<v Voiceover>People forget the skin</v>

94
00:03:30.947 --> 00:03:32.248
takes in all those toxins.

95
00:03:32.248 --> 00:03:33.709
<v ->The skin is the largest organ of your body.</v>

96
00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.660
So yeah, we're just being bombarded 24/7.

97
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.412
<v Voiceover>And you're talking about the things</v>

98
00:03:36.412 --> 00:03:37.596
that would be considered more natural,

99
00:03:37.596 --> 00:03:41.115
water, fruits, vegetables, chicken.

100
00:03:42.005 --> 00:03:43.563
What happens with the rest of the food

101
00:03:43.563 --> 00:03:46.325
that a lot of Americans eat even a higher percentage of

102
00:03:46.325 --> 00:03:48.789
than those quote more naturally based foods?

103
00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:51.178
<v ->Right, well think about all the chemically altered foods,</v>

104
00:03:51.178 --> 00:03:53.504
genetically altered foods, processed foods,

105
00:03:53.504 --> 00:03:55.520
foods that are in cans or, you know,

106
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.119
we live in a society where everything's gotta be

107
00:03:57.119 --> 00:04:00.095
fast, fast, fast, and so we have all these frozen things

108
00:04:00.095 --> 00:04:01.652
and you pop it in the microwave

109
00:04:01.652 --> 00:04:04.457
and it just doesn't even provide any nutrients anymore.

110
00:04:04.457 --> 00:04:06.548
I mean, our food is basically dead in this country.

111
00:04:06.548 --> 00:04:08.319
And, you know, also, when we talk about, you know,

112
00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.327
natural and fruits and vegetables,

113
00:04:10.327 --> 00:04:14.646
they're growing from soils that are so minerally depleted.

114
00:04:14.646 --> 00:04:16.971
I mean, we don't really have good, rich soil anymore.

115
00:04:16.971 --> 00:04:19.244
We've stripped the soils of all the nutrients.

116
00:04:19.244 --> 00:04:20.448
We're not putting them back in,

117
00:04:20.448 --> 00:04:21.963
we're not doing anything to address that,

118
00:04:21.963 --> 00:04:23.488
so you have fruits and vegetables now that have

119
00:04:23.488 --> 00:04:26.411
maybe 40 or 30 percent of the nutrient value

120
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:29.036
they did back in like the 1930s and 1940s.

121
00:04:29.036 --> 00:04:31.221
So, here we are, a society that's so toxic,

122
00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:33.056
but we're so nutritionally bankrupt,

123
00:04:33.056 --> 00:04:35.073
and that leads to tons of disease and illness,

124
00:04:35.073 --> 00:04:36.389
especially in the digestive area.

125
00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.297
<v Voiceover>And yet we consume more and more</v>

126
00:04:38.297 --> 00:04:39.524
and more calories than ever.

127
00:04:39.524 --> 00:04:40.271
<v ->Yes we do.</v>

128
00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:41.989
We're the most overfed nation in the world

129
00:04:41.989 --> 00:04:44.218
and yet we are definitely the most

130
00:04:44.218 --> 00:04:46.211
undernourished and the sickest.

131
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:48.121
Isn't that amazing, what we're doing to ourselves?

132
00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:48.814
<v Voiceover>It truly is amazing.</v>

133
00:04:48.814 --> 00:04:50.450
Now, as a medical doctor,

134
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.604
you had a certain bag of tools

135
00:04:52.604 --> 00:04:54.631
that you could work with when people came in.

136
00:04:54.631 --> 00:04:55.207
<v ->Right.</v>

137
00:04:55.207 --> 00:04:56.525
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about the traditional route.</v>

138
00:04:56.525 --> 00:04:58.476
Someone comes in and they have one of these,

139
00:04:58.476 --> 00:05:01.382
Crohn's disease or irritable bowel syndrome,

140
00:05:01.382 --> 00:05:02.428
something like this.

141
00:05:02.428 --> 00:05:05.419
What were you able to do for them in those days?

142
00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.458
<v ->Well, it goes back to the way most physicians are taught.</v>

143
00:05:08.458 --> 00:05:10.432
I mean, when you start medical school,

144
00:05:10.432 --> 00:05:11.594
all the way through medical school,

145
00:05:11.594 --> 00:05:13.545
internship, residency, fellowship,

146
00:05:13.545 --> 00:05:16.074
you're taught about drugs, pharmaceuticals.

147
00:05:16.074 --> 00:05:18.185
You know, take a history, do a physical,

148
00:05:18.185 --> 00:05:19.913
but you know what, prescribe a med.

149
00:05:19.913 --> 00:05:21.972
And I was taught that.

150
00:05:21.972 --> 00:05:24.788
So, when I first started in to my GI practice,

151
00:05:24.788 --> 00:05:26.707
it was all about what drug I could offer

152
00:05:26.707 --> 00:05:28.936
that individual based on their symptom.

153
00:05:28.936 --> 00:05:31.144
You have irritable bowel, then you need to take this.

154
00:05:31.144 --> 00:05:33.022
You have ulcerative colitis, you need to take five of,

155
00:05:33.022 --> 00:05:34.441
you know, five different drugs.

156
00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:36.837
You have Crohn's disease, well you need six or seven.

157
00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:39.713
And it's just the way the world is run

158
00:05:39.713 --> 00:05:41.141
in terms of traditional medicine.

159
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:42.347
<v Voiceover>And then what would happen to the person?</v>

160
00:05:42.347 --> 00:05:43.627
<v ->They would come back.</v>

161
00:05:43.627 --> 00:05:44.409
I mean, you'd see side effects.

162
00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.393
You'd see tremendous side effects with drugs,

163
00:05:46.393 --> 00:05:48.345
and so, sometimes, the side effect was worse

164
00:05:48.345 --> 00:05:51.128
than the actual disease you were treating.

165
00:05:51.128 --> 00:05:53.337
And then, if you started to pile more drugs on,

166
00:05:53.337 --> 00:05:54.585
then there was interactions.

167
00:05:54.585 --> 00:05:55.886
But people would keep coming back.

168
00:05:55.886 --> 00:05:58.275
I mean, you know, every couple of months or every year,

169
00:05:58.275 --> 00:06:00.089
they would return and say, "You know, I'm worse off now

170
00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:02.158
"than I've ever been, and now I'm seeing

171
00:06:02.158 --> 00:06:03.854
"a lot of other sub-specialists because

172
00:06:03.854 --> 00:06:05.335
"I've got this problem and that problem."

173
00:06:05.335 --> 00:06:07.075
And all these diseases and illnesses are piling up

174
00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:09.559
and all these different drugs are being prescribed.

175
00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:11.863
And so, here's the frustration.

176
00:06:11.863 --> 00:06:13.858
I mean, you're not helping people.

177
00:06:13.858 --> 00:06:15.511
You're giving them more toxins.

178
00:06:15.511 --> 00:06:17.783
You're not treating the internal body.

179
00:06:17.783 --> 00:06:19.793
You're not teaching that body to heal itself.

180
00:06:19.793 --> 00:06:21.056
What you're doing is, you're just piling on

181
00:06:21.056 --> 00:06:22.389
a bunch of band-aids.

182
00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:24.246
So, that's the way I was trained.

183
00:06:24.246 --> 00:06:27.030
That's what I did for many years until I woke up one day.

184
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.703
<v Voiceover>And I wanna ask you about that in a moment,</v>

185
00:06:28.703 --> 00:06:31.489
but first, how many, what percentage of the population

186
00:06:31.489 --> 00:06:34.585
would you say, at-large, just from your vantage point

187
00:06:34.585 --> 00:06:39.085
has some sort of digestive or elimination malfunction?

188
00:06:39.085 --> 00:06:40.163
<v ->Oh my goodness.</v>

189
00:06:40.163 --> 00:06:43.758
I mean, in my opinion, I'd say about 95 percent

190
00:06:43.758 --> 00:06:46.243
of everyone walking around has some irritable bowel

191
00:06:46.243 --> 00:06:50.094
or some type of, you know, gas bloat symptom or syndrome,

192
00:06:50.094 --> 00:06:53.303
constipation, you know, change in bowel pattern,

193
00:06:53.303 --> 00:06:54.722
abdominal discomforts.

194
00:06:54.722 --> 00:06:56.716
My office is packed.

195
00:06:56.716 --> 00:06:59.585
I mean, it's unbelievable how many individuals

196
00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:02.049
are lining up to come in to see the GI doctor.

197
00:07:02.049 --> 00:07:04.321
And, even in this little town where we live,

198
00:07:04.321 --> 00:07:06.412
there are not enough GI doctors to take care of

199
00:07:06.412 --> 00:07:08.289
the population down here

200
00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:09.812
with all the digestive distress that's going on.

201
00:07:09.812 --> 00:07:10.581
It's crazy.

202
00:07:10.581 --> 00:07:12.359
<v Voiceover>Seems like people are complaining all the time</v>

203
00:07:12.359 --> 00:07:16.651
and have come to accept this as a normal reaction to food.

204
00:07:16.651 --> 00:07:17.600
<v ->Right, right.</v>

205
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.064
And, especially, you know, I see a lot of female patients

206
00:07:20.064 --> 00:07:22.265
in my practice because they'd like to see a woman GI doctor,

207
00:07:22.265 --> 00:07:23.826
but there are so many men out there,

208
00:07:23.826 --> 00:07:26.290
they just assume it's normal to feel, you know,

209
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:27.655
the gas, the bloat, the abdominal pain,

210
00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:28.626
the change in bowel pattern,

211
00:07:28.626 --> 00:07:30.835
because they don't even seek medical care.

212
00:07:30.835 --> 00:07:32.467
But if you ask them, they'll tell you,

213
00:07:32.467 --> 00:07:34.226
"Oh yeah, it's because I ate this or I ate that

214
00:07:34.226 --> 00:07:35.208
"and that's what's causing all this

215
00:07:35.208 --> 00:07:37.073
"digestive distress today."

216
00:07:37.073 --> 00:07:38.621
That's not normal.

217
00:07:38.621 --> 00:07:40.130
And it's not normal to be constipated.

218
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.113
I mean, it's unbelievable what I see in my practice.

219
00:07:42.113 --> 00:07:44.065
I have people that move their bowels once a week,

220
00:07:44.065 --> 00:07:45.761
once a month.
<v Voiceover>Oh my gosh.</v>

221
00:07:45.761 --> 00:07:46.689
<v ->And, you know why?</v>

222
00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:48.780
It's because of all the garbage we're putting in

223
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.030
and it's clogging the pipes, basically.

224
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.654
And we're not hydrated and we're not doing the right things,

225
00:07:53.654 --> 00:07:54.626
we're not eating enough fiber,

226
00:07:54.626 --> 00:07:55.723
we're not putting the good nutrients in,

227
00:07:55.723 --> 00:07:58.390
so the whole intestinal tract shuts down.

228
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.663
Think about the impurities.

229
00:07:59.663 --> 00:08:00.845
<v Voiceover>What happens when your intestinal tract</v>

230
00:08:00.845 --> 00:08:02.940
starts becoming even more toxic and shutting down?

231
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.464
What are some of the other symptoms and diseases?

232
00:08:05.464 --> 00:08:08.561
<v ->People just, they fatigue, chronic fatigue.</v>

233
00:08:08.561 --> 00:08:10.513
A lot of people complain of just joint aches,

234
00:08:10.513 --> 00:08:12.293
not sleeping well.

235
00:08:12.293 --> 00:08:15.387
I've seen, you know, just this whole cascade of problems.

236
00:08:15.387 --> 00:08:17.681
Metabolically, you just feel sluggish

237
00:08:17.681 --> 00:08:21.744
and so, you know, just looking at digestive sluggishness,

238
00:08:21.744 --> 00:08:23.813
it's linked to all different types of, you know,

239
00:08:23.813 --> 00:08:25.349
just not feeling well in general.

240
00:08:25.349 --> 00:08:26.671
<v Voiceover>What about your immune system?</v>

241
00:08:26.671 --> 00:08:27.854
<v ->Your immune system breaks down,</v>

242
00:08:27.854 --> 00:08:29.593
you're susceptible to viruses,

243
00:08:29.593 --> 00:08:30.873
all types of disease and illness.

244
00:08:30.873 --> 00:08:33.208
I mean, the body, when it's clogged,

245
00:08:33.208 --> 00:08:36.141
the whole system is like a bad domino effect.

246
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:38.094
And I see a lot of liver disease that,

247
00:08:38.094 --> 00:08:41.315
definitely being triggered by all this clogging

248
00:08:41.315 --> 00:08:42.712
that's going on in the body.

249
00:08:42.712 --> 00:08:43.565
It's tremendous.

250
00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:45.755
Low thyroid is another perfect example.

251
00:08:45.755 --> 00:08:49.468
Years ago, I never saw women with a low thyroid

252
00:08:49.468 --> 00:08:51.366
to the degree I see today.

253
00:08:51.366 --> 00:08:53.531
Almost every woman that walks into my office

254
00:08:53.531 --> 00:08:55.174
over the age of 45 or 50

255
00:08:55.174 --> 00:08:57.873
is on some type of thyroid replacement.

256
00:08:57.873 --> 00:09:00.145
Has a lot to do with the liver being clogged

257
00:09:00.145 --> 00:09:02.491
and when the liver is clogged, the thyroid becomes sluggish.

258
00:09:02.491 --> 00:09:04.124
And then, if your thyroid is sluggish,

259
00:09:04.124 --> 00:09:07.164
it will even tend to make you more constipated

260
00:09:07.164 --> 00:09:09.434
and have, you know, less of a metabolic rate.

261
00:09:09.434 --> 00:09:12.128
And then, obesity, and all that.

262
00:09:12.128 --> 00:09:13.430
<v Voiceover>And obesity does seem to follow</v>

263
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:14.559
in many, many cases.

264
00:09:14.559 --> 00:09:15.307
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

265
00:09:15.307 --> 00:09:16.726
You know, we have 81 percent of our population

266
00:09:16.726 --> 00:09:19.349
that's obese, or excuse me, overweight

267
00:09:19.349 --> 00:09:20.651
and 31 percent obese.

268
00:09:20.651 --> 00:09:22.485
We have 18 million children in this country

269
00:09:22.485 --> 00:09:23.851
that are dealing with obesity.

270
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:26.314
I mean, this is scary, what's going on.

271
00:09:26.314 --> 00:09:27.849
And, again, these foods that we're ingesting,

272
00:09:27.849 --> 00:09:30.441
they're so nutritionally bankrupt,

273
00:09:30.441 --> 00:09:31.935
but, you know, all these toxins

274
00:09:31.935 --> 00:09:33.396
that are coming in with all this terrible food

275
00:09:33.396 --> 00:09:35.646
causes a lot of this fat to develop

276
00:09:35.646 --> 00:09:38.057
because fat and toxins sit together in the body.

277
00:09:38.057 --> 00:09:39.849
And I've seen this in my patient base.

278
00:09:39.849 --> 00:09:43.048
Every year, if they're not addressing this issue,

279
00:09:43.048 --> 00:09:45.001
and we'll talk about that later,

280
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:46.301
on how to address this issue,

281
00:09:46.301 --> 00:09:49.000
but every one of my patients just kept coming in

282
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.848
heavier and heavier and heavier each year, on the scale.

283
00:09:51.848 --> 00:09:54.153
I would just see this whole cascade of, you know,

284
00:09:54.153 --> 00:09:55.827
five pounds, 10 pounds, 15 pounds,

285
00:09:55.827 --> 00:09:58.002
you know, 100 pounds over a couple of years,

286
00:09:58.002 --> 00:10:01.630
and, again, all of the health problems that go with obesity.

287
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.832
I mean, the list goes on forever.

288
00:10:03.832 --> 00:10:04.541
<v Voiceover>So, it must have been</v>

289
00:10:04.541 --> 00:10:07.166
very frustrating for you as a doctor,

290
00:10:08.194 --> 00:10:09.612
cycling these people through

291
00:10:09.612 --> 00:10:12.257
and recycling and recycling, seeing them getting fatter,

292
00:10:12.257 --> 00:10:13.632
less healthy, more toxic.

293
00:10:13.632 --> 00:10:16.000
So, what was your awakening?

294
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.389
<v ->It was actually a patient of mine that</v>

295
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:21.526
I had taken care of her for years, for many years,

296
00:10:21.526 --> 00:10:22.826
and she was never getting better.

297
00:10:22.826 --> 00:10:24.586
She was a lady that had fibromyalgia,

298
00:10:24.586 --> 00:10:26.622
she had the chronic fatigue, she was gaining weight,

299
00:10:26.622 --> 00:10:29.209
migraines, all different types of problems,

300
00:10:29.209 --> 00:10:31.044
saw numerous sub-specialists.

301
00:10:31.044 --> 00:10:33.230
Her digestion was a disaster,

302
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:35.534
you know, pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation,

303
00:10:35.534 --> 00:10:37.988
you know, it was just a mess no matter what I did.

304
00:10:37.988 --> 00:10:41.795
The tests and the drugs and just trying everything with her,

305
00:10:41.795 --> 00:10:43.214
nothing seemed to work.

306
00:10:43.214 --> 00:10:44.558
And every time she'd come into the office,

307
00:10:44.558 --> 00:10:45.880
I would just want to run and hide

308
00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.257
because I could never help her

309
00:10:47.257 --> 00:10:48.601
with my traditional approaches.

310
00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:50.478
And she disappeared for about a year.

311
00:10:50.478 --> 00:10:51.810
I didn't see her for about a year.

312
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:54.317
And then, one day, her name landed on my list,

313
00:10:54.317 --> 00:10:56.610
my clinic list, and I thought, "Oh boy, she's back.

314
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.072
"What's going on?"
<v Voiceover>What now?</v>

315
00:10:58.072 --> 00:11:01.908
<v ->And I walk in and I see a vibrant,</v>

316
00:11:01.908 --> 00:11:03.347
young-looking woman

317
00:11:03.347 --> 00:11:07.021
with a stylish hair-do, beautiful color in her face,

318
00:11:07.021 --> 00:11:11.799
slim, smiling, happy, and I looked at the chart

319
00:11:11.799 --> 00:11:13.964
and I looked at her and I said, "Is this you?"

320
00:11:13.964 --> 00:11:15.487
I'm like, "What did you do?"

321
00:11:15.487 --> 00:11:17.877
She's like, "None of you doctors could help me."

322
00:11:17.877 --> 00:11:19.253
She goes, "But I am coming back to talk to you

323
00:11:19.253 --> 00:11:20.693
"because you always listened."

324
00:11:20.693 --> 00:11:22.251
She goes, "You were a good listener."

325
00:11:22.251 --> 00:11:24.404
And she said, "You know, I found a program

326
00:11:24.404 --> 00:11:26.121
"and it was about cleansing my body,

327
00:11:26.121 --> 00:11:28.767
"my internal body, and putting nutrients in,

328
00:11:28.767 --> 00:11:31.189
"minerals, vitamins, high-grade protein,

329
00:11:31.189 --> 00:11:33.717
"and my goodness, I started to shed the pounds,

330
00:11:33.717 --> 00:11:35.870
"I started to get my mental clarity back,

331
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.314
"I started to notice that my body was healing itself,

332
00:11:38.314 --> 00:11:40.938
"and I started to take myself off my drugs."

333
00:11:40.938 --> 00:11:42.217
She goes, "I called my doctors and just said,

334
00:11:42.217 --> 00:11:43.743
"'I'm coming off because I don't need them,

335
00:11:43.743 --> 00:11:44.820
"'I don't have the pain,

336
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.110
"'I'm going to the bathroom every day,

337
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:47.273
"'I don't have the headaches,

338
00:11:47.273 --> 00:11:49.480
"'I'm mobile again, I'm exercising.'"

339
00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.621
And she said, "You know,

340
00:11:50.621 --> 00:11:53.654
"this is how you need to help your patients."

341
00:11:53.654 --> 00:11:55.777
And it started to just click

342
00:11:55.777 --> 00:11:58.006
that I hadn't been helping people for so long

343
00:11:58.006 --> 00:12:00.375
with just piling on the drugs and I was really frustrated

344
00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:02.027
and I didn't like what I was doing anymore.

345
00:12:02.027 --> 00:12:03.254
So, she opened my eyes.

346
00:12:03.254 --> 00:12:04.651
And that's when I started to do my due diligence,

347
00:12:04.651 --> 00:12:06.368
looking at natural alternatives,

348
00:12:06.368 --> 00:12:08.044
cleansing the body internally,

349
00:12:08.044 --> 00:12:10.871
replenishing, fueling the body with the right nutrients,

350
00:12:10.871 --> 00:12:13.356
organics, you know, what's good to put in there

351
00:12:13.356 --> 00:12:15.265
to allow the body to heal itself.

352
00:12:15.265 --> 00:12:17.398
It created some remission, so this made sense.

353
00:12:17.398 --> 00:12:20.000
And the more I learned, the more I wanted to learn more

354
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.643
and then, you know, and try it on myself

355
00:12:21.643 --> 00:12:23.245
and, you know, and then introduce it to others,

356
00:12:23.245 --> 00:12:23.955
and it's made a world of difference.

357
00:12:23.955 --> 00:12:24.592
<v Voiceover>So, how did that work,</v>

358
00:12:24.592 --> 00:12:26.937
with your introducing it to your patients?

359
00:12:26.937 --> 00:12:29.050
Did you have to be tentative about it

360
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:30.841
and kinda hide what you were doing,

361
00:12:30.841 --> 00:12:32.090
or were you allowed?

362
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:33.786
<v ->Initially, initially yes, I was a little tentative</v>

363
00:12:33.786 --> 00:12:35.929
because this is really breaking the mold

364
00:12:35.929 --> 00:12:38.461
of what traditional doctors do and what they're taught.

365
00:12:38.461 --> 00:12:41.287
And so, as I started to introduce nutrition and cleansing

366
00:12:41.287 --> 00:12:43.912
into my practice, I was pleased at the results.

367
00:12:43.912 --> 00:12:45.351
I mean, my patients were coming back going,

368
00:12:45.351 --> 00:12:48.567
"I feel amazing, I just, I have more zest for life.

369
00:12:48.567 --> 00:12:51.125
"My relationships are better, I'm less stressed."

370
00:12:51.125 --> 00:12:52.570
All of these wonderful things.

371
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:54.446
But, as that happened,

372
00:12:54.446 --> 00:12:57.304
all these little rumors started to run across town

373
00:12:57.304 --> 00:13:00.359
that Dr. Becky was prescribing voodoo

374
00:13:00.359 --> 00:13:01.127
<v Voiceover>Food!</v>

375
00:13:01.127 --> 00:13:03.079
<v ->And it was basically food,</v>

376
00:13:03.079 --> 00:13:06.022
but they thought it was voodoo because it wasn't a drug.

377
00:13:06.022 --> 00:13:07.068
I mean, what is she doing?

378
00:13:07.068 --> 00:13:09.006
Has she lost her mind?

379
00:13:09.006 --> 00:13:11.236
And it was terrible because, actually,

380
00:13:11.236 --> 00:13:13.167
these physicians were like, they were my peers

381
00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:14.511
and they were sending me patients,

382
00:13:14.511 --> 00:13:15.886
but they were also saying, "Well, she's doing some

383
00:13:15.886 --> 00:13:17.902
"really weird stuff in her office.

384
00:13:17.902 --> 00:13:19.299
"We're not so sure about her anymore."

385
00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:21.615
But, I knew I was doing the right thing.

386
00:13:21.615 --> 00:13:23.620
And so I just kept going and going

387
00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.414
and sharing this with my patients and,

388
00:13:25.414 --> 00:13:28.210
as they started to have tremendous health results,

389
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:30.023
a lot of these other physicians that were so negative

390
00:13:30.023 --> 00:13:32.135
in the beginning, started to call me and say,

391
00:13:32.135 --> 00:13:34.044
"What are you doing because, you know,

392
00:13:34.044 --> 00:13:36.241
"Gladys is off her diabetes meds

393
00:13:36.241 --> 00:13:37.937
"for the first time in 10 years

394
00:13:37.937 --> 00:13:39.942
"and so-and-so lost 50 pounds,

395
00:13:39.942 --> 00:13:41.212
"so-and-so lost 100 pounds,

396
00:13:41.212 --> 00:13:42.908
"so-and-so doesn't have migraines anymore,

397
00:13:42.908 --> 00:13:43.844
"don't have arthritis."

398
00:13:43.844 --> 00:13:45.914
And they were interested because

399
00:13:45.914 --> 00:13:48.069
they started to see that they weren't helping

400
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:49.465
on a level they should be helping

401
00:13:49.465 --> 00:13:52.129
with just pharmaceuticals that we dole out.

402
00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:54.936
<v Voiceover>So, let's get into what a person can do.</v>

403
00:13:54.936 --> 00:13:56.397
Where does one begin?

404
00:13:56.397 --> 00:13:59.075
You have, say you're 30, 40 pounds overweight,

405
00:13:59.075 --> 00:14:01.093
you're sluggish, you're depressed,

406
00:14:01.503 --> 00:14:03.913
your bowel's not moving properly.

407
00:14:05.073 --> 00:14:07.101
I assume that's kind of a classic scenario

408
00:14:07.101 --> 00:14:08.444
of someone that would enter your office.

409
00:14:08.444 --> 00:14:09.511
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

410
00:14:09.511 --> 00:14:11.259
<v Voiceover>Where do you tell them to begin now?</v>

411
00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:13.115
<v ->Well, you know, I educate them</v>

412
00:14:13.115 --> 00:14:15.132
and I've also created some tools that I can hand,

413
00:14:15.132 --> 00:14:17.574
you know, brochures or CDs, and hand them to my patients

414
00:14:17.574 --> 00:14:20.870
that start to educate them on the body, the miracle, OK?

415
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.075
And the body is miraculous,

416
00:14:22.075 --> 00:14:24.262
but if it's clogged with impurities and toxins

417
00:14:24.262 --> 00:14:25.349
and it's nutritionally bankrupt,

418
00:14:25.349 --> 00:14:26.747
it cannot function as the miracle.

419
00:14:26.747 --> 00:14:28.443
It is a set-up for disease and illness,

420
00:14:28.443 --> 00:14:30.342
a lot of degenerative diseases and obesity

421
00:14:30.342 --> 00:14:31.504
and digestive problems.

422
00:14:31.504 --> 00:14:33.989
So I educate them on, OK, we need to talk about

423
00:14:33.989 --> 00:14:35.408
putting fuel in the body,

424
00:14:35.408 --> 00:14:36.752
because we're not gonna talk about dieting,

425
00:14:36.752 --> 00:14:38.351
we're not gonna talk about fasting,

426
00:14:38.351 --> 00:14:39.748
we're gonna talk about fueling the body

427
00:14:39.748 --> 00:14:41.785
with high-grade organic nutrients.

428
00:14:41.785 --> 00:14:43.379
And a lot of times we have to supplement

429
00:14:43.379 --> 00:14:46.089
because, you know, we just can't go to the grocery store

430
00:14:46.089 --> 00:14:47.753
and buy 360 different ingredients.

431
00:14:47.753 --> 00:14:49.982
Sometimes we need to find the right program

432
00:14:49.982 --> 00:14:53.098
that will offer the body all these high-grade nutrients

433
00:14:53.098 --> 00:14:56.305
that provide that fuel for, you know, our internal organs.

434
00:14:56.305 --> 00:14:58.020
So, I put people on different systems

435
00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.061
and teach them about cleansing.

436
00:15:00.061 --> 00:15:01.995
There's certain herbs that you can ingest

437
00:15:01.995 --> 00:15:04.545
and certain cleansing mineral drinks that you can ingest

438
00:15:04.545 --> 00:15:07.447
that will absolutely allow your liver to flush fat,

439
00:15:07.447 --> 00:15:09.355
will allow your liver to flush toxins,

440
00:15:09.355 --> 00:15:12.096
will allow your liver to function properly.

441
00:15:12.096 --> 00:15:14.273
So, when you get your liver healthy,

442
00:15:14.273 --> 00:15:16.811
it is your major detoxifying organ of your body

443
00:15:16.811 --> 00:15:18.798
and everything will have a positive cascade

444
00:15:18.798 --> 00:15:20.612
after that liver starts working.

445
00:15:20.612 --> 00:15:22.010
So, if your liver's working really strong

446
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.140
and you're cleansing internally,

447
00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.423
then your thyroid will work so much better

448
00:15:25.423 --> 00:15:27.876
and then your digestive tract will start working really well

449
00:15:27.876 --> 00:15:29.646
and when you put these nutrients in,

450
00:15:29.646 --> 00:15:31.129
and I'm also a big proponent

451
00:15:31.129 --> 00:15:33.518
of digestive enzymes and probiotics,

452
00:15:33.518 --> 00:15:36.140
you get maximum absorption of nutrients.

453
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.654
So, all these nutrients start flowing through your body

454
00:15:38.654 --> 00:15:40.606
and your body just starts to come alive

455
00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.387
and your cells start to come alive

456
00:15:42.387 --> 00:15:44.669
and then you start to flush toxins out of the body

457
00:15:44.669 --> 00:15:46.110
and you flush fat.

458
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:47.335
Fat and toxins sit together.

459
00:15:47.335 --> 00:15:48.380
The Environmental Protection Agency

460
00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.500
did a wonderful study.

461
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.653
It was over four decades.

462
00:15:50.653 --> 00:15:53.125
They looked at fat cells in the body of cadavers

463
00:15:53.125 --> 00:15:55.750
and just surgical specimens that were sent to them.

464
00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.487
And they found dozens and dozens and dozens

465
00:15:57.487 --> 00:15:59.812
of toxins that sit within the fat.

466
00:15:59.812 --> 00:16:01.712
So, when you get people to cleanse internally,

467
00:16:01.712 --> 00:16:03.108
and you teach them and you educate them

468
00:16:03.108 --> 00:16:04.729
on how to continue to provide the fuel

469
00:16:04.729 --> 00:16:06.821
to allow your body to utilize nutrients,

470
00:16:06.821 --> 00:16:08.334
to be a natural detoxifier,

471
00:16:08.334 --> 00:16:10.095
your body will continue to flush the toxins

472
00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:12.559
and that's why people get so lean when they cleanse.

473
00:16:12.559 --> 00:16:14.362
They get lean, they watch muscle development

474
00:16:14.362 --> 00:16:17.923
because we put them on high-grade, organic whey protein

475
00:16:17.923 --> 00:16:20.654
and it helps to develop dense lean muscle.

476
00:16:20.654 --> 00:16:22.520
All the essential amino acids

477
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.184
that I have people supplement with,

478
00:16:24.184 --> 00:16:27.149
it also helps them develop muscle while they lose the fat.

479
00:16:27.149 --> 00:16:29.677
So, I'm into balance and I'm into education,

480
00:16:29.677 --> 00:16:31.938
I'm into maintenance for life,

481
00:16:31.938 --> 00:16:34.348
teaching people that there is a maintenance way,

482
00:16:34.348 --> 00:16:37.207
you know, every day, putting in high-grade nutrients,

483
00:16:37.207 --> 00:16:40.407
say, for breakfast, you know, instead of having a bagel

484
00:16:40.407 --> 00:16:41.730
or having garbage for breakfast,

485
00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.311
why not have a high-grade organic whey protein shake,

486
00:16:44.311 --> 00:16:46.656
put some minerals in there, have your vitamins,

487
00:16:46.656 --> 00:16:48.534
leave the house with 360 nutrients

488
00:16:48.534 --> 00:16:51.414
circulating in your body, your brain is alive,

489
00:16:51.414 --> 00:16:52.896
you can multitask all day long,

490
00:16:52.896 --> 00:16:55.521
you come home, you're still ready to go with your family,

491
00:16:55.521 --> 00:16:57.728
and you're up until, like, 10 or 11 at night,

492
00:16:57.728 --> 00:16:59.168
you go to bed, you sleep well, you wake up

493
00:16:59.168 --> 00:17:00.490
and you're ready to go the next morning

494
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:01.578
'cause you get on this routine.

495
00:17:01.578 --> 00:17:02.741
So, again, I teach people

496
00:17:02.741 --> 00:17:06.645
long-term quality of life approaches,

497
00:17:06.645 --> 00:17:07.648
not a quick fix.

498
00:17:07.648 --> 00:17:09.130
I'm never into the quick fix because,

499
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:10.196
with all of the toxins

500
00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:12.192
and all of the terrible food that's out there,

501
00:17:12.192 --> 00:17:14.302
a quick fix is not gonna do it for you.

502
00:17:14.302 --> 00:17:15.913
It may help you for a short period of time,

503
00:17:15.913 --> 00:17:17.855
but if you're not doing something every single day,

504
00:17:17.855 --> 00:17:20.186
then the body's just gonna start to fall apart again,

505
00:17:20.186 --> 00:17:22.457
so you need to address this every single day.

506
00:17:22.457 --> 00:17:25.024
<v Voiceover>And, would you suggest going about it slowly</v>

507
00:17:25.927 --> 00:17:29.042
as the consumer, being gentle with yourself?

508
00:17:29.042 --> 00:17:31.431
A lot of people go on to the Master Cleanse,

509
00:17:31.431 --> 00:17:32.637
that's a big one right now,

510
00:17:32.637 --> 00:17:34.013
and then after about two days,

511
00:17:34.013 --> 00:17:36.008
give me an anything.

512
00:17:36.008 --> 00:17:38.054
Just give me some food.

513
00:17:38.054 --> 00:17:41.158
And so, it seems to be, for some people,

514
00:17:41.158 --> 00:17:43.183
they can do it, others it seems very defeating.

515
00:17:43.183 --> 00:17:44.987
And then they think, well, I tried the cleanse thing,

516
00:17:44.987 --> 00:17:46.684
it didn't work for me, I was so hungry.

517
00:17:46.684 --> 00:17:48.636
It doesn't have to be like that, does it?

518
00:17:48.636 --> 00:17:50.651
<v ->No, in fact most individuals</v>

519
00:17:50.651 --> 00:17:52.251
are health-challenged nowadays.

520
00:17:52.251 --> 00:17:55.110
So, if you have an individual that's obese, type 2 diabetic,

521
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:57.221
hypertensive, high cholesterol, high triglycerides,

522
00:17:57.221 --> 00:17:59.035
heart problems, all of these issues

523
00:17:59.035 --> 00:18:02.054
and you try to get them to do a major cleanse,

524
00:18:02.054 --> 00:18:04.517
they don't like it because, again, you're gonna have

525
00:18:04.517 --> 00:18:06.336
cleansing symptoms, OK, your body's toxic--

526
00:18:06.336 --> 00:18:07.285
<v Voiceover>What are those?</v>

527
00:18:07.285 --> 00:18:08.820
<v ->Oh, many, if you're very toxic.</v>

528
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:09.930
I mean, you can have headache,

529
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.162
you can have a lot of digestive distress initially,

530
00:18:13.162 --> 00:18:15.550
could be constipation, could be a little bit of diarrhea,

531
00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:17.961
could be gas and bloating, could be nausea and vomiting.

532
00:18:17.961 --> 00:18:20.777
I have people that, you know, they have extreme fatigue

533
00:18:20.777 --> 00:18:22.200
because, you know, the body's just like trying

534
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.525
to release all these toxins and it's very overwhelming,

535
00:18:24.525 --> 00:18:26.594
so they just don't like the way they feel.

536
00:18:26.594 --> 00:18:27.910
They just don't like it.

537
00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.758
So, I always teach people that a slow approach is fine.

538
00:18:30.758 --> 00:18:33.643
Again, this is a long-term approach for quality of life.

539
00:18:33.643 --> 00:18:35.339
<v Voiceover>You're talking about a commitment for life.</v>

540
00:18:35.339 --> 00:18:36.169
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

541
00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:37.258
Lay out your goals.

542
00:18:37.258 --> 00:18:39.263
Say, OK, I wanna lose 50 pounds, 100 pounds,

543
00:18:39.263 --> 00:18:41.468
I wanna come off my diabetic meds because,

544
00:18:41.468 --> 00:18:43.086
you know, diabetes is a terrible,

545
00:18:43.086 --> 00:18:44.602
terrible degenerative disease.

546
00:18:44.602 --> 00:18:46.265
It breaks down the body in many forms.

547
00:18:46.265 --> 00:18:48.729
You know, lay out your goals and then start a plan

548
00:18:48.729 --> 00:18:50.863
that's slow, that's achievable, so--

549
00:18:50.863 --> 00:18:52.333
<v Voiceover>Not like, I'm going to my</v>

550
00:18:52.333 --> 00:18:54.322
20th high school reunion

551
00:18:54.322 --> 00:18:56.744
and I have to lose 50 pounds in six weeks.

552
00:18:56.744 --> 00:18:57.334
<v ->Right.</v>

553
00:18:57.334 --> 00:18:57.900
<v Voiceover>Wrong?</v>

554
00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.085
(both laugh)

555
00:18:59.085 --> 00:19:00.503
<v ->I've actually had people that,</v>

556
00:19:00.503 --> 00:19:02.795
they want an aggressive approach,

557
00:19:02.795 --> 00:19:04.236
but again, I counsel them on,

558
00:19:04.236 --> 00:19:06.720
OK, if you're going to do the aggressive approach initially,

559
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.855
what's your maintenance approach after that?

560
00:19:08.855 --> 00:19:11.381
And, you know, again, if you're cleansing your body

561
00:19:11.381 --> 00:19:12.523
and you're fueling your body

562
00:19:12.523 --> 00:19:14.101
and you're losing weight rapidly,

563
00:19:14.101 --> 00:19:16.019
it's absolutely fine, actually.

564
00:19:16.019 --> 00:19:18.288
It's just when you're dieting and fasting

565
00:19:18.288 --> 00:19:19.007
and starving the body,

566
00:19:19.007 --> 00:19:22.144
if you're losing all kinds of water weight, muscle weight,

567
00:19:22.144 --> 00:19:23.487
and that's so dangerous.

568
00:19:23.487 --> 00:19:24.744
So I'm all about balance, you know.

569
00:19:24.744 --> 00:19:25.716
Teach people balance.

570
00:19:25.716 --> 00:19:27.069
You know, fuel with the right stuff,

571
00:19:27.069 --> 00:19:28.435
cleanse the impurities so that

572
00:19:28.435 --> 00:19:29.854
the body will have the internal balance

573
00:19:29.854 --> 00:19:31.156
and then you see the muscle development

574
00:19:31.156 --> 00:19:33.704
and you see how you lean out, you feel good,

575
00:19:33.704 --> 00:19:36.029
the brain chemistry starts to realign.

576
00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:37.374
But a slow approach is wonderful.

577
00:19:37.374 --> 00:19:38.439
I will start people on something

578
00:19:38.439 --> 00:19:40.179
called a 90-day action plan.

579
00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:43.287
That's our jump-start 90 days.

580
00:19:43.287 --> 00:19:45.612
You know, we're gonna commit to this

581
00:19:45.612 --> 00:19:46.741
as our jumping-off point,

582
00:19:46.741 --> 00:19:49.228
but this is about life, so in 90 days,

583
00:19:49.228 --> 00:19:51.105
if you get people to start fueling the body,

584
00:19:51.105 --> 00:19:53.472
doing a little bit of cleansing here and there,

585
00:19:53.472 --> 00:19:54.895
they will see wonderful results,

586
00:19:54.895 --> 00:19:56.336
but they're focused over 90 days

587
00:19:56.336 --> 00:19:58.308
and that's a really good plan

588
00:19:58.308 --> 00:20:00.069
because that internal body, over 90 days,

589
00:20:00.069 --> 00:20:01.232
will really see some changes.

590
00:20:01.232 --> 00:20:02.708
That's kind of the magical minimum

591
00:20:02.708 --> 00:20:04.766
to see wonderful health results,

592
00:20:04.766 --> 00:20:06.483
and when you start to feel good

593
00:20:06.483 --> 00:20:07.924
and you see the body changing,

594
00:20:07.924 --> 00:20:08.909
you're never gonna quit.

595
00:20:08.909 --> 00:20:10.072
Why would you wanna quit?

596
00:20:10.072 --> 00:20:12.760
You get addicted to, you're feeling so good.

597
00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.440
You're addicted to health, you're addicted to energy.

598
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.988
And, what else is really amazing is

599
00:20:16.988 --> 00:20:19.426
bad addictions go away for a lot of people.

600
00:20:19.426 --> 00:20:20.556
<v Voiceover>Well, I was going to just ask you about that.</v>

601
00:20:20.556 --> 00:20:21.421
Bad addictions.

602
00:20:21.421 --> 00:20:23.340
So what happens with the big C,

603
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.111
the big coffee addiction in the morning.

604
00:20:25.111 --> 00:20:27.383
What is that doing, first of all, to the system?

605
00:20:27.383 --> 00:20:29.963
Well, you know, oh, caffeine, coffee?

606
00:20:29.963 --> 00:20:31.126
It's just no good.

607
00:20:31.126 --> 00:20:32.631
I mean, from a digestive standpoint,

608
00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:34.935
it can cause a lot of irritable symptoms.

609
00:20:34.935 --> 00:20:36.854
You know, a lot of gas, diarrhea.

610
00:20:36.854 --> 00:20:39.276
It will rev up, sometimes, the digestive system,

611
00:20:39.276 --> 00:20:40.384
but in a bad way.

612
00:20:40.384 --> 00:20:41.526
It's just very deteriorating.

613
00:20:41.526 --> 00:20:45.807
So, you know, the unhealthy body craves unhealthy things.

614
00:20:45.807 --> 00:20:48.656
I just think about my patients that smoke,

615
00:20:48.656 --> 00:20:50.373
that drink a lot, that eat a lot of fast foods,

616
00:20:50.373 --> 00:20:52.954
eat a lot of carbohydrates, they drink a lot of soda,

617
00:20:52.954 --> 00:20:55.173
they drink a lot of Starbucks coffee.

618
00:20:55.173 --> 00:20:57.711
I mean, the unhealthy body will crave unhealthy things.

619
00:20:57.711 --> 00:20:59.434
So, if you start to fuel the body,

620
00:20:59.434 --> 00:21:01.567
cleanse the body of impurities, guess what?

621
00:21:01.567 --> 00:21:04.074
The healthy body, the healthy brain chemistry,

622
00:21:04.074 --> 00:21:06.067
will start to crave healthy things.

623
00:21:06.067 --> 00:21:07.700
So, I have seen individuals that were,

624
00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:11.060
they were drinking three pots of coffee a day.

625
00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.902
We got them to cleanse and replenish,

626
00:21:12.902 --> 00:21:15.479
they just naturally lost the craving.

627
00:21:15.479 --> 00:21:16.610
Didn't appeal to them.

628
00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:18.076
It just didn't, it was just something

629
00:21:18.076 --> 00:21:19.510
they didn't even think about.

630
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:23.019
My mother-in-law smoked for 37 years.

631
00:21:23.019 --> 00:21:25.227
She smoked cigarettes, she tried the patch,

632
00:21:25.227 --> 00:21:27.733
the gum, hypnotherapy, she tried all three together,

633
00:21:27.733 --> 00:21:28.917
and she still smoked.

634
00:21:28.917 --> 00:21:32.021
We got her to cleanse and replenish her body,

635
00:21:32.021 --> 00:21:35.210
and not only has it been an anti-aging miracle for her,

636
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:36.452
I mean, she just looks younger every time I see her

637
00:21:36.452 --> 00:21:38.223
because she's on a maintenance plan for life,

638
00:21:38.223 --> 00:21:40.517
she quit smoking right when she started cleansing

639
00:21:40.517 --> 00:21:43.221
because she said she started to feel changes in her body

640
00:21:43.221 --> 00:21:44.883
and then she tried to smoke,

641
00:21:44.883 --> 00:21:46.461
she was so used to smoking in the morning,

642
00:21:46.461 --> 00:21:48.047
but it tasted like poison.

643
00:21:48.047 --> 00:21:50.116
And she said, "I couldn't put poison in

644
00:21:50.116 --> 00:21:51.832
"when I knew that the poison was coming out

645
00:21:51.832 --> 00:21:53.507
"and my body just rejected it."

646
00:21:53.507 --> 00:21:55.150
So, we see this with coffee drinkers,

647
00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:56.845
we see it with, oh, a good friend of mine was drinking,

648
00:21:56.845 --> 00:21:59.330
you know, liters of soda every day

649
00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:00.589
and she had terrible irritable bowel.

650
00:22:00.589 --> 00:22:02.114
She had one of the worst cases I've ever seen.

651
00:22:02.544 --> 00:22:04.774
And I put her through the million-dollar work-up

652
00:22:04.774 --> 00:22:06.651
and could find nothing.

653
00:22:06.651 --> 00:22:08.347
And I said, "You need to cleanse your body,

654
00:22:08.347 --> 00:22:10.993
"you need to fuel your body, rejuvenate your body."

655
00:22:10.993 --> 00:22:12.016
And we got her on a system.

656
00:22:12.016 --> 00:22:14.662
And she called me about 30 days into the program.

657
00:22:14.662 --> 00:22:16.768
She's like, "You know, I'm back to normal.

658
00:22:16.768 --> 00:22:18.049
"My bowels function perfectly.

659
00:22:18.049 --> 00:22:21.088
"I have no abdominal discomfort, I'm back to work,

660
00:22:21.088 --> 00:22:22.384
"and I don't drink sodas."

661
00:22:22.384 --> 00:22:23.801
I said, "How many sodas were you drinking?"

662
00:22:23.801 --> 00:22:25.753
And she's like, "Liters of soda."

663
00:22:25.753 --> 00:22:26.771
And I said, "That's amazing."

664
00:22:26.771 --> 00:22:28.328
And she said, "I don't crave it anymore."

665
00:22:28.328 --> 00:22:30.066
She says it's not even in her home.

666
00:22:30.066 --> 00:22:30.989
So, isn't that amazing, what happens?

667
00:22:30.989 --> 00:22:31.873
<v Voiceover>It is amazing.</v>

668
00:22:31.873 --> 00:22:33.003
Well, what about alcohol?

669
00:22:33.003 --> 00:22:33.751
<v ->Same thing.</v>

670
00:22:33.751 --> 00:22:35.287
I mean, there are many individuals that'll tell you

671
00:22:35.287 --> 00:22:36.929
they just don't have that craving for it

672
00:22:36.929 --> 00:22:39.671
because the healthy body is craving healthier things.

673
00:22:39.671 --> 00:22:40.993
We make better food choices

674
00:22:40.993 --> 00:22:43.180
like with our family, and our kids.

675
00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.114
See, our kids, they do protein every morning,

676
00:22:45.114 --> 00:22:47.280
do a protein shake, they do minerals,

677
00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.862
and they're very fueled, so these little minds

678
00:22:49.862 --> 00:22:52.966
are working and those bodies are craving healthy things.

679
00:22:52.966 --> 00:22:57.519
So, we have four children, ages 7, 10, 11 and 16.

680
00:22:57.519 --> 00:22:58.980
You can't hand them a candy bar.

681
00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.553
They won't drink soda.

682
00:23:00.553 --> 00:23:02.228
They actually make the right choices,

683
00:23:02.228 --> 00:23:04.404
organic, you know, fruits and vegetables.

684
00:23:04.404 --> 00:23:07.049
We go to the grocery store and it's actually amazing

685
00:23:07.049 --> 00:23:10.462
to watch these little bodies and brains making good choices.

686
00:23:10.462 --> 00:23:11.603
But that's what we taught them.

687
00:23:11.603 --> 00:23:14.042
See, in our home, my husband always says,

688
00:23:14.042 --> 00:23:17.029
"Nutrition is not a democracy in our home,

689
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:19.357
it is a dictatorship with little kids."

690
00:23:19.357 --> 00:23:21.054
But you have to do that because look at how,

691
00:23:21.054 --> 00:23:23.165
you know, the NIH is predicting right now,

692
00:23:23.165 --> 00:23:25.533
well actually the CDC is predicting

693
00:23:25.533 --> 00:23:27.143
that one out of every three of our children

694
00:23:27.143 --> 00:23:29.633
born in today's society will be type 2 diabetics

695
00:23:29.633 --> 00:23:32.053
before they're a teenager if we don't make changes.

696
00:23:32.053 --> 00:23:33.354
And we need to make changes.

697
00:23:33.354 --> 00:23:34.816
You need to talk about education.

698
00:23:34.816 --> 00:23:36.628
We've gotta educate the kids.

699
00:23:36.628 --> 00:23:37.483
<v Voiceover>We do.</v>

700
00:23:37.483 --> 00:23:38.624
I raised my son that same way.

701
00:23:38.624 --> 00:23:41.706
Again, the high-grade whey protein shakes in the morning

702
00:23:41.706 --> 00:23:44.418
before going to school and I can't even,

703
00:23:44.418 --> 00:23:46.798
I don't think he missed a day of school,

704
00:23:46.798 --> 00:23:48.953
and not only that, when he wasn't feeling well

705
00:23:48.953 --> 00:23:51.575
a couple times with a cold, he would pretend,

706
00:23:51.575 --> 00:23:53.852
he would fake being well so he could go to school.

707
00:23:53.852 --> 00:23:54.545
<v ->There you go!</v>

708
00:23:54.545 --> 00:23:55.879
<v Voiceover>And it was just a whole different life</v>

709
00:23:55.879 --> 00:23:57.264
than other kids were living,

710
00:23:57.264 --> 00:23:59.003
just from getting him off to a good start

711
00:23:59.003 --> 00:24:01.003
and no junk like that around the house.

712
00:24:01.003 --> 00:24:02.422
<v ->Well, their immune systems are so strong</v>

713
00:24:02.422 --> 00:24:03.627
when you start to give them nutrients,

714
00:24:03.627 --> 00:24:05.504
and also brain chemistry's a big issue,

715
00:24:05.504 --> 00:24:07.525
but, from an immune standpoint, our children,

716
00:24:07.525 --> 00:24:09.872
they don't get the flus, the colds, the sniffles.

717
00:24:09.872 --> 00:24:10.846
We've been pharmaceutical-free

718
00:24:10.846 --> 00:24:12.564
in this household for close to four years.

719
00:24:12.564 --> 00:24:13.688
I mean, that's amazing, 'cause my son--

720
00:24:13.688 --> 00:24:14.754
<v Voiceover>Amazing in an MD's home.</v>

721
00:24:14.754 --> 00:24:16.878
<v ->Absolutely, I mean, isn't that awesome?</v>

722
00:24:16.878 --> 00:24:17.826
<v Voiceover>That is wonderful.</v>

723
00:24:17.826 --> 00:24:18.871
<v ->But the other thing that I notice, too,</v>

724
00:24:18.871 --> 00:24:19.800
with the brain chemistry,

725
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.937
and this is really important.

726
00:24:20.937 --> 00:24:23.622
The pharmaceutical industries, they're pushing so hard for,

727
00:24:23.622 --> 00:24:27.015
you know, all these drugs for ADD and ADHD and, you know,

728
00:24:27.015 --> 00:24:28.549
give them Adderall and give them, you know,

729
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:30.289
all this garbage, basically.

730
00:24:30.289 --> 00:24:34.171
What these children need are nutrients to fuel the brain,

731
00:24:34.171 --> 00:24:35.302
to balance the dopamine levels,

732
00:24:35.302 --> 00:24:36.606
to balance the serotonin levels,

733
00:24:36.606 --> 00:24:39.598
and to allow these bodies and brains to be thinking,

734
00:24:39.598 --> 00:24:40.445
like when they go to school,

735
00:24:40.445 --> 00:24:42.493
and if they're not fueled with the right stuff

736
00:24:42.493 --> 00:24:43.954
and they're drinking sugar drinks

737
00:24:43.954 --> 00:24:45.256
and they're having all these, you know,

738
00:24:45.256 --> 00:24:48.109
these carbohydrate-based, you know, breakfast meals,

739
00:24:48.109 --> 00:24:49.308
their brain shuts down.

740
00:24:49.308 --> 00:24:51.792
They get to school and the brain is just done.

741
00:24:51.792 --> 00:24:53.115
You know, it just can't function.

742
00:24:53.115 --> 00:24:55.601
So, then, all of a sudden, you see all these little kids

743
00:24:55.601 --> 00:24:56.827
and they're on all these drugs

744
00:24:56.827 --> 00:24:58.128
that have all these terrible side effects.

745
00:24:58.128 --> 00:24:58.708
<v Voiceover>Right, it's terrible.</v>

746
00:24:58.708 --> 00:25:02.889
<v ->So, I'm on a mission to really educate families about how,</v>

747
00:25:02.889 --> 00:25:04.533
you know, this is a family affair

748
00:25:04.533 --> 00:25:06.026
when it comes to quality of life.

749
00:25:06.026 --> 00:25:08.074
It's not just about you, mom and dad and, you know,

750
00:25:08.074 --> 00:25:09.930
the Baby Boomers that, you know, they wanna feel better,

751
00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:11.295
look better, you know, anti-aging,

752
00:25:11.295 --> 00:25:12.531
this is about the kids.

753
00:25:12.531 --> 00:25:13.586
We've gotta get all the kids involved with this.

754
00:25:13.586 --> 00:25:14.182
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

755
00:25:14.182 --> 00:25:16.209
We don't need to have another chronically ill generation.

756
00:25:16.209 --> 00:25:17.063
<v ->No kidding.</v>

757
00:25:17.063 --> 00:25:18.204
<v Voiceover>This is really not an option</v>

758
00:25:18.204 --> 00:25:19.707
on a lot of levels anymore.

759
00:25:19.707 --> 00:25:20.476
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

760
00:25:20.476 --> 00:25:21.045
<v Voiceover>Do it right.</v>

761
00:25:21.045 --> 00:25:22.166
<v ->I mean, we're in a health crisis.</v>

762
00:25:22.166 --> 00:25:23.002
I mean, you know it.

763
00:25:23.002 --> 00:25:24.740
But, you know, it's staggering that,

764
00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.365
with all the pediatric illness that's going on right now.

765
00:25:27.365 --> 00:25:29.808
You know, I've seen so many sub-specialists come in

766
00:25:29.808 --> 00:25:31.332
that are pediatric sub-specialists.

767
00:25:31.332 --> 00:25:32.655
We've got pediatric cardiologists,

768
00:25:32.655 --> 00:25:33.797
infectious disease specialists,

769
00:25:33.797 --> 00:25:34.916
gastrointestinal specialists,

770
00:25:34.916 --> 00:25:36.655
all these pediatric sub-specialists

771
00:25:36.655 --> 00:25:38.927
that we didn't have 15, 20 years ago,

772
00:25:38.927 --> 00:25:40.718
but now we're building hospitals just for children

773
00:25:40.718 --> 00:25:41.946
and it's just--

774
00:25:41.946 --> 00:25:42.335
<v Voiceover>Sad.</v>

775
00:25:42.335 --> 00:25:45.449
<v ->It makes me sick, so, this is where education comes in.</v>

776
00:25:45.449 --> 00:25:47.400
<v Voiceover>Well, and you've made a big decision.</v>

777
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.928
You're actually closing your medical practice?

778
00:25:49.928 --> 00:25:50.718
Is that correct?

779
00:25:50.718 --> 00:25:52.311
<v ->Yes, within the next two months.</v>

780
00:25:52.311 --> 00:25:53.254
<v Voiceover>Can you talk to me about that?</v>

781
00:25:53.254 --> 00:25:57.818
<v ->Well, you know, we started to teach people how to cleanse</v>

782
00:25:57.818 --> 00:25:59.197
and how to replenish their bodies

783
00:25:59.197 --> 00:26:00.296
and I just saw what was happening

784
00:26:00.296 --> 00:26:04.777
and I just thought, "I can no longer dole out the drugs.

785
00:26:04.777 --> 00:26:06.216
I cannot do this anymore."

786
00:26:06.216 --> 00:26:08.094
I kinda cringe every time

787
00:26:08.094 --> 00:26:09.687
a pharmaceutical rep comes into my office,

788
00:26:09.687 --> 00:26:12.385
and sometimes I'll have five or six a day in my office,

789
00:26:12.385 --> 00:26:14.637
teaching me about the latest, greatest new drug.

790
00:26:14.637 --> 00:26:16.748
<v Voiceover>Seriously, the reps come every day?</v>

791
00:26:16.748 --> 00:26:17.931
<v ->Oh yeah, they come into your office</v>

792
00:26:17.931 --> 00:26:19.788
and then they say to the front office manager,

793
00:26:19.788 --> 00:26:21.227
"We'd like to bring you lunch

794
00:26:21.227 --> 00:26:22.551
because we wanna teach you about

795
00:26:22.551 --> 00:26:24.065
the new drug that's in town."

796
00:26:24.065 --> 00:26:27.477
And then they bring you lunch that's basically poison.

797
00:26:27.477 --> 00:26:29.078
You know, you have all these people in the office

798
00:26:29.078 --> 00:26:30.657
eating this garbage and listening about

799
00:26:30.657 --> 00:26:32.235
more toxic pharmaceuticals,

800
00:26:32.235 --> 00:26:35.766
so, I just became very almost angry

801
00:26:35.766 --> 00:26:38.197
with what that industry has done to America.

802
00:26:38.197 --> 00:26:40.426
So, I made a decision, along with my husband,

803
00:26:40.426 --> 00:26:43.616
that I'm going to retire, take that leave of absence

804
00:26:43.616 --> 00:26:46.496
from traditional medicine, and now I'll do this

805
00:26:46.496 --> 00:26:49.620
as my life's dream, to go out there

806
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.434
and effect positive change with individuals

807
00:26:51.434 --> 00:26:54.088
by education, teaching them natural alternatives,

808
00:26:54.088 --> 00:26:57.475
teaching them that there's another way to heal the body,

809
00:26:57.475 --> 00:27:00.139
the only way, I think, you know, is through natural means,

810
00:27:00.139 --> 00:27:01.290
that we don't need all these drugs.

811
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:02.425
I mean, once in a blue moon,

812
00:27:02.425 --> 00:27:04.889
there's a need for a pharmaceutical, but it's short-lived.

813
00:27:04.889 --> 00:27:07.416
What's happening now with the pharmaceutical industry is

814
00:27:07.416 --> 00:27:09.289
they want you on drugs for life.

815
00:27:09.289 --> 00:27:10.590
<v Voiceover>For life, starting as a child.</v>

816
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:11.817
<v ->They're teaching you that everything's a disease,</v>

817
00:27:11.817 --> 00:27:13.278
everything's labeled a disease.

818
00:27:13.278 --> 00:27:15.346
<v Voiceover>Jumpy legs, now there's a drug for jumpy legs.</v>

819
00:27:15.346 --> 00:27:19.506
<v ->Oh, there's actually now a name for road rage.</v>

820
00:27:19.506 --> 00:27:22.781
They've given it an acronym and it's like,

821
00:27:22.781 --> 00:27:27.372
something like explosive behavior, like, abnormality.

822
00:27:27.372 --> 00:27:29.110
<v Voiceover>Do they have a drug for road rage?</v>

823
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:30.688
<v ->And then you know where it's going with this.</v>

824
00:27:30.688 --> 00:27:32.673
You know that this explosive behavior

825
00:27:32.673 --> 00:27:34.763
is going to have a drug attached to it any day now.

826
00:27:34.763 --> 00:27:36.086
I mean, you know, reflux.

827
00:27:36.086 --> 00:27:38.453
We used to think burping was natural,

828
00:27:38.453 --> 00:27:41.237
no, it's gastroesophageal reflux disease.

829
00:27:41.237 --> 00:27:43.306
You need to take this for life.

830
00:27:43.306 --> 00:27:45.526
And I just, I can't do that anymore.

831
00:27:47.206 --> 00:27:48.406
<v Voiceover>Good for you.</v>

832
00:27:48.406 --> 00:27:50.516
I know you're probably not popular

833
00:27:50.516 --> 00:27:52.207
among your colleagues, some of them anymore.

834
00:27:52.207 --> 00:27:53.155
<v ->Actually, a lot are going,</v>

835
00:27:53.155 --> 00:27:54.691
"Hmm, what is she doing, she's helping people."

836
00:27:54.691 --> 00:27:57.156
And, also by helping people, you know,

837
00:27:57.156 --> 00:27:59.342
abundance will come into your life in many ways.

838
00:27:59.342 --> 00:28:00.824
<v Voiceover>Yes because there are</v>

839
00:28:00.824 --> 00:28:03.353
fabulous products out there, many fabulous products

840
00:28:03.353 --> 00:28:05.400
and product lines to maintain health,

841
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.554
and I know you're familiar with a number of them

842
00:28:07.554 --> 00:28:09.367
and get some really good results,

843
00:28:09.367 --> 00:28:11.927
but is there a way that people,

844
00:28:11.927 --> 00:28:14.798
once they make this decision and go on a 90-day plan,

845
00:28:15.588 --> 00:28:19.174
can use kinda minimal supplementation

846
00:28:19.174 --> 00:28:22.193
in terms of actual dietary or meal plans

847
00:28:22.193 --> 00:28:23.851
and use, go to the health-food store

848
00:28:23.851 --> 00:28:26.863
and use real food and kinda keep the cost down on it?

849
00:28:26.863 --> 00:28:29.274
Or is it just so labor-intensive with our--?

850
00:28:29.274 --> 00:28:29.748
<v ->No, not really.</v>

851
00:28:29.748 --> 00:28:32.093
I mean, when I put people on a maintenance plan for life,

852
00:28:32.093 --> 00:28:34.377
I keep it really simple because, you know, we're busy

853
00:28:34.377 --> 00:28:37.810
and, if you make it complicated or you make it expensive,

854
00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:40.019
it's not gonna fly, people will quit, they won't do it.

855
00:28:40.019 --> 00:28:41.545
So, if you get somebody on, for example,

856
00:28:41.545 --> 00:28:44.222
like a meal replacement system just once a day

857
00:28:44.222 --> 00:28:46.119
instead of having, you know, garbage for breakfast

858
00:28:46.119 --> 00:28:47.794
or a lot of people skip breakfast, so, again,

859
00:28:47.794 --> 00:28:50.229
the brain chemistry's all messed up throughout the day.

860
00:28:50.229 --> 00:28:51.453
But if you get them on maintenance,

861
00:28:51.453 --> 00:28:52.957
let's say a shake in the morning,

862
00:28:52.957 --> 00:28:54.280
some minerals in the morning, some vitamins,

863
00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.372
have your nutrients, then go out, be sensible for lunch,

864
00:28:57.372 --> 00:28:58.385
don't live in a bubble.

865
00:28:58.385 --> 00:28:59.901
I mean, we don't even teach our kids that.

866
00:28:59.901 --> 00:29:02.087
We say, "You know what, you're gonna eat at school.

867
00:29:02.087 --> 00:29:03.175
"We know it's not good for you."

868
00:29:03.175 --> 00:29:04.593
We'll go out and have dinner, you know,

869
00:29:04.593 --> 00:29:06.354
and we know that some of that food may not be good for you.

870
00:29:06.354 --> 00:29:07.931
But if you have the right fuel,

871
00:29:07.931 --> 00:29:09.073
the right stuff in your body,

872
00:29:09.073 --> 00:29:11.206
it can start to to really detoxify

873
00:29:11.206 --> 00:29:13.437
all of those impurities that are coming in.

874
00:29:13.437 --> 00:29:15.361
But if you wanna really be healthy, yeah,

875
00:29:15.361 --> 00:29:17.429
go to the store and buy organic.

876
00:29:17.429 --> 00:29:18.816
Make sure that the meats,

877
00:29:18.816 --> 00:29:21.142
the chicken that you're ingesting is not injected.

878
00:29:21.142 --> 00:29:22.720
You can find natural products

879
00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.829
that are actually very affordable.

880
00:29:23.829 --> 00:29:25.859
There's a lot of stores that are coming up

881
00:29:25.859 --> 00:29:28.571
and they're very, very well-priced and so

882
00:29:28.571 --> 00:29:30.522
we go in and we ask the butcher,

883
00:29:30.522 --> 00:29:32.187
"OK, where do you get your chicken?

884
00:29:32.187 --> 00:29:33.722
"Does it have hormones, does it have steroids in it?

885
00:29:33.722 --> 00:29:34.607
"No? Good!"

886
00:29:34.607 --> 00:29:36.932
OK, we want the natural stuff, we want the organics.

887
00:29:36.932 --> 00:29:39.973
So, we're, again, educating our family

888
00:29:39.973 --> 00:29:41.755
on how to make those right choices.

889
00:29:41.755 --> 00:29:43.365
If you're sensible, and again,

890
00:29:43.365 --> 00:29:44.707
just do one meal replacement a day

891
00:29:44.707 --> 00:29:45.937
with high-grade nutrients,

892
00:29:45.937 --> 00:29:47.774
your body's gonna be very much in balance.

893
00:29:47.774 --> 00:29:50.162
Let's say, your 90-day action plan,

894
00:29:50.162 --> 00:29:51.880
you lost the weight that you wanted to lose.

895
00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.576
You lost the 50 pounds, you know, whatever.

896
00:29:53.576 --> 00:29:56.711
You will maintain your gorgeous new figure

897
00:29:56.711 --> 00:29:58.780
by just a simple maintenace program.

898
00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.466
Because, again, the body will utilize that fuel

899
00:30:00.466 --> 00:30:02.769
to naturally detoxify and handle any of those impurities

900
00:30:02.769 --> 00:30:04.189
that you're faced with every day.

901
00:30:04.189 --> 00:30:05.489
'Cause, soon as you get up in the morning,

902
00:30:05.489 --> 00:30:07.880
from the minute you get up till when you go to bed,

903
00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.489
you're being bombarded with impurities in our air.

904
00:30:12.439 --> 00:30:14.202
You get these athletes that think they're so healthy

905
00:30:14.202 --> 00:30:15.717
'cause they're out there running every day,

906
00:30:15.717 --> 00:30:17.040
breathing in exhaust,

907
00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.896
breathing in all that pollution that's circulating.

908
00:30:18.896 --> 00:30:21.520
You know, again, showering in water that's poisonous

909
00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.676
and exposed to food that's poisoned.

910
00:30:22.676 --> 00:30:23.444
<v Voiceover>So that's another thing,</v>

911
00:30:23.444 --> 00:30:27.420
replacing your shower heads with a filtration unit.

912
00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.059
<v ->Do that, you can do that for the air in the home,</v>

913
00:30:29.059 --> 00:30:30.499
you can have filtration of the air.

914
00:30:30.499 --> 00:30:31.960
There's a lot of good things that you can do

915
00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.381
and, again, because we are being so bombarded

916
00:30:34.381 --> 00:30:36.472
with all these toxins, you can't get away from them,

917
00:30:36.472 --> 00:30:38.352
but at least you can do certain things

918
00:30:38.352 --> 00:30:39.484
to keep the body at least

919
00:30:39.484 --> 00:30:41.062
a little bit more internally balanced.

920
00:30:41.062 --> 00:30:42.993
And when you do and you start feeling good,

921
00:30:42.993 --> 00:30:44.710
again, you get addicted to the way you feel

922
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:46.086
and you're never gonna quit, and why would you?

923
00:30:46.086 --> 00:30:48.006
<v Voiceover>That's true, people seem to immediately think,</v>

924
00:30:48.006 --> 00:30:49.425
"Oh, this is about deprivation,

925
00:30:49.425 --> 00:30:50.725
"I can't have my favorite things

926
00:30:50.725 --> 00:30:53.426
"like Twinkies and a latte for breakfast."

927
00:30:53.426 --> 00:30:55.092
But in truth, once you're balanced,

928
00:30:55.092 --> 00:30:56.837
that doesn't sound good anymore, right?

929
00:30:56.837 --> 00:30:57.966
<v ->No, you don't wanna put the poison--</v>

930
00:30:57.966 --> 00:30:58.894
<v Voiceover>That doesn't sound good.</v>

931
00:30:58.894 --> 00:31:00.974
<v ->Again, that healthy body starts craving healthy things,</v>

932
00:31:00.974 --> 00:31:02.606
but, you know what, if you wanna go out

933
00:31:02.606 --> 00:31:04.451
and be a little crazy with dinner or, you know--

934
00:31:04.451 --> 00:31:05.652
<v Voiceover>Have a piece of birthday cake, yup.</v>

935
00:31:05.652 --> 00:31:07.544
<v ->Have your wine with dinner, then it's fine.</v>

936
00:31:07.544 --> 00:31:09.312
Your body can handle it when you've got

937
00:31:09.312 --> 00:31:11.263
the right nutrients in it to give it balance.

938
00:31:11.263 --> 00:31:12.682
So, and people like that.

939
00:31:12.682 --> 00:31:13.882
They do want to live, you know.

940
00:31:13.882 --> 00:31:15.481
They wanna go out there and enjoy their life

941
00:31:15.481 --> 00:31:16.483
and that's what this is about.

942
00:31:16.483 --> 00:31:17.668
It's about balance.

943
00:31:18.057 --> 00:31:20.077
<v Voiceover>Well, any other final thoughts</v>

944
00:31:20.077 --> 00:31:21.352
that you'd like to impart?

945
00:31:21.352 --> 00:31:22.945
Anything we haven't covered yet?

946
00:31:23.388 --> 00:31:25.415
<v ->Well, you know, again, I think that</v>

947
00:31:25.415 --> 00:31:27.570
when anyone embraces a program like this,

948
00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:28.711
they have an obligation

949
00:31:28.711 --> 00:31:30.782
to not only educate their whole family about it,

950
00:31:30.782 --> 00:31:33.183
but they have this obligation to get out there

951
00:31:33.183 --> 00:31:35.851
and share this with everybody they care about

952
00:31:35.851 --> 00:31:37.386
and everybody they come in contact with.

953
00:31:37.386 --> 00:31:40.383
I mean, my husband and I, we travel extensively,

954
00:31:40.383 --> 00:31:42.772
but when we travel, we're always in a situation

955
00:31:42.772 --> 00:31:44.460
where we're meeting new people

956
00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.991
and we're forging new relationships.

957
00:31:46.991 --> 00:31:49.113
And we feel it to be an ethical

958
00:31:49.113 --> 00:31:51.012
and moral obligation on our part

959
00:31:51.012 --> 00:31:53.103
to share with them what we know

960
00:31:53.103 --> 00:31:55.567
about how to heal the body internally.

961
00:31:55.567 --> 00:31:57.124
And we do it with everyone,

962
00:31:57.124 --> 00:31:58.511
whether, you know, we just met you

963
00:31:58.511 --> 00:32:00.676
or we've known you for just an hour, whatever.

964
00:32:00.676 --> 00:32:01.924
We're always sharing.

965
00:32:01.924 --> 00:32:04.269
And I think that that's the way to go.

966
00:32:04.269 --> 00:32:06.222
We need to get out there, we need to help the masses

967
00:32:06.222 --> 00:32:07.597
because we're in a health crisis

968
00:32:07.597 --> 00:32:10.009
and it can't go on the way it's going on.

969
00:32:10.009 --> 00:32:12.142
The hospitals are already overflowing.

970
00:32:12.142 --> 00:32:15.409
And, for me, one of my big passions is also

971
00:32:15.409 --> 00:32:18.268
to educate people that we don't need all these drugs, OK?

972
00:32:18.268 --> 00:32:20.337
I mean, the food industry and the pharmaceutical industry,

973
00:32:20.337 --> 00:32:22.012
they're very powerful industries.

974
00:32:22.012 --> 00:32:24.348
But they don't wanna see us healthy

975
00:32:24.348 --> 00:32:26.513
because that would affect their industry.

976
00:32:26.513 --> 00:32:29.214
Well, we're now in a wellness revolution.

977
00:32:29.214 --> 00:32:31.216
This is the next trillion-dollar industry,

978
00:32:31.216 --> 00:32:33.012
the wellness industry.

979
00:32:33.012 --> 00:32:35.052
And because we do have a lot of people out there

980
00:32:35.052 --> 00:32:37.708
that are finally resonating with this wellness revolution,

981
00:32:37.708 --> 00:32:40.438
and very powerful individuals that are resonating with this,

982
00:32:40.438 --> 00:32:41.771
we're gonna make a difference.

983
00:32:41.771 --> 00:32:43.691
But, you know, one step at a time.

984
00:32:43.691 --> 00:32:44.992
<v Voiceover>I believe you're going</v>

985
00:32:44.992 --> 00:32:46.390
to make a huge difference.

986
00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:47.872
I wish you the very best.

987
00:32:47.872 --> 00:32:51.278
I'd like to see Dr. Becky in the big lights

988
00:32:51.278 --> 00:32:53.304
and I have no doubt that that's going to happen

989
00:32:53.304 --> 00:32:56.483
because, really, the people in this culture

990
00:32:56.483 --> 00:32:58.291
need to hear what you have to say.

991
00:32:58.291 --> 00:32:58.802
<v ->Thank you.</v>

992
00:32:58.802 --> 00:33:00.691
And I will mention that, you know,

993
00:33:00.691 --> 00:33:03.047
throughout this learning curve,

994
00:33:03.047 --> 00:33:04.658
I did take a lot of what I learned

995
00:33:04.658 --> 00:33:06.055
and I did put it in a book.

996
00:33:06.055 --> 00:33:08.093
And, if I can mention that.

997
00:33:08.093 --> 00:33:11.878
<v Voiceover>Yes, "Ifs, Ands, or Butts and Guts."</v>

998
00:33:11.878 --> 00:33:13.222
<v ->Right, "Ifs, Ands, or Butts and Guts."</v>

999
00:33:13.222 --> 00:33:15.829
It's a kitschy title and the reason that title came to be,

1000
00:33:15.829 --> 00:33:18.081
you know, I'm a gastroenterologist and, you know,

1001
00:33:18.081 --> 00:33:19.104
I've done colonoscopies.

1002
00:33:19.104 --> 00:33:20.037
<v Voiceover>A butts and guts doctor.</v>

1003
00:33:20.037 --> 00:33:20.667
<v ->I've done, I think,</v>

1004
00:33:20.667 --> 00:33:22.597
about 18,000 colonoscopies in my career,

1005
00:33:22.597 --> 00:33:23.621
if you can believe that.

1006
00:33:23.621 --> 00:33:26.937
But my kids could never say "gastroenterology"

1007
00:33:26.937 --> 00:33:28.169
or "gastrointestinal specialist,"

1008
00:33:28.169 --> 00:33:30.026
so they just call me the butts and guts doctor.

1009
00:33:30.026 --> 00:33:32.191
So I've been known as the butts and guts doctor now,

1010
00:33:32.191 --> 00:33:34.142
you know, throughout the whole family.

1011
00:33:34.142 --> 00:33:37.250
So, what I did is, I just took what I was learning,

1012
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:39.010
you know, in terms of nutrients, digestion,

1013
00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:41.538
how things adversely affect our digestive tract,

1014
00:33:41.538 --> 00:33:44.163
our livers, why we're becoming so obese in this country,

1015
00:33:44.163 --> 00:33:45.443
and I put it in this book

1016
00:33:45.443 --> 00:33:48.620
and it's an educational book, but it's hilarious

1017
00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:53.548
because I took a lot of different poems and comics

1018
00:33:53.548 --> 00:33:55.330
and experiences that I've had with my patients

1019
00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:57.836
over the past decade and I put it in the book.

1020
00:33:57.836 --> 00:33:59.671
So, as you read, you will laugh 'cause it's like,

1021
00:33:59.671 --> 00:34:01.975
you know, I'll tell a joke about butts and guts

1022
00:34:01.975 --> 00:34:03.574
and then we'll talk about digestion

1023
00:34:03.574 --> 00:34:05.153
and what you can put into your body

1024
00:34:05.153 --> 00:34:06.273
to heal the body internally

1025
00:34:06.273 --> 00:34:07.915
and how you can rev up your digestive system

1026
00:34:07.915 --> 00:34:09.516
and help with all these different problems

1027
00:34:09.516 --> 00:34:12.054
like irritable bowel and constipation and diarrhea,

1028
00:34:12.054 --> 00:34:14.650
and it's actually been a huge hit

1029
00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:16.874
because people, you know, laughter is good medicine.

1030
00:34:16.874 --> 00:34:17.664
<v Voiceover>Yes it is.</v>

1031
00:34:17.664 --> 00:34:19.360
<v ->So, people like to learn, but they like to laugh</v>

1032
00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.237
and it's easy reading, and I love it.

1033
00:34:21.237 --> 00:34:23.672
I've been giving them out to my patients.

1034
00:34:23.672 --> 00:34:26.484
But "Ifs, Ands, or Butts and Guts" is just a wonderful book

1035
00:34:26.484 --> 00:34:27.422
if you like to laugh and learn.

1036
00:34:27.422 --> 00:34:28.723
<v Voiceover>Well, I can tell you, this holiday season,</v>

1037
00:34:28.723 --> 00:34:31.260
that's what my friends and family will be getting.

1038
00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:33.715
<v ->We gave tons out for the holidays last year.</v>

1039
00:34:33.715 --> 00:34:36.040
So, again, you know, and I'm gonna write more,

1040
00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:40.228
now that I'm leaving medicine, I wanna write with my family

1041
00:34:40.228 --> 00:34:43.013
many children's books, educating the kids on nutrition.

1042
00:34:43.013 --> 00:34:43.621
<v Voiceover>Wonderful.</v>

1043
00:34:43.621 --> 00:34:45.222
<v ->We're gonna be blunt, we're gonna be blunt about it.</v>

1044
00:34:45.222 --> 00:34:47.871
We're gonna say, "It's not fun to have diabetes.

1045
00:34:47.871 --> 00:34:49.471
"It's not fun to be a young teenager

1046
00:34:49.471 --> 00:34:50.873
"and shooting up insulin."

1047
00:34:50.873 --> 00:34:52.372
And, you know, we're gonna be pretty blunt,

1048
00:34:52.372 --> 00:34:54.217
but, you know what, we're gonna get it out there--

1049
00:34:54.217 --> 00:34:55.092
<v Voiceover>People need it.</v>

1050
00:34:55.092 --> 00:34:56.607
<v ->And it's really gonna make a difference.</v>

1051
00:34:56.607 --> 00:34:58.047
And then we're gonna also do another book

1052
00:34:58.047 --> 00:35:00.180
that's gonna expose a lot of the stuff

1053
00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:01.811
that I saw in medicine

1054
00:35:01.811 --> 00:35:04.777
and it's really gonna be an eye-opening type of book,

1055
00:35:04.777 --> 00:35:05.890
so that's on the horizon.

1056
00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:06.524
<v Voiceover>Well, as Oprah would say,</v>

1057
00:35:06.524 --> 00:35:07.405
you go girl!

1058
00:35:07.405 --> 00:35:09.019
<v ->That's on the horizon.</v>

1059
00:35:09.019 --> 00:35:09.808
<v Voiceover>Very good.</v>

1060
00:35:09.808 --> 00:35:11.312
Well, thank you so much for your time.

1061
00:35:11.312 --> 00:35:13.915
This is going to make a big difference

1062
00:35:13.915 --> 00:35:15.098
in a lot of people's lives.

1063
00:35:15.098 --> 00:35:16.159
<v ->Thank you so much.</v>

1064
00:35:19.338 --> 00:35:21.289
<v ->Click below for a copy of her book,</v>

1065
00:35:21.289 --> 00:35:24.287
"Ifs, Ands, or Butts and Guts."

1066
00:35:24.287 --> 00:35:25.630
You may also want to look at

1067
00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:27.231
both of our previous interviews with

1068
00:35:27.231 --> 00:35:30.416
Dr. Lorraine Day, who also gave up her medical practice

1069
00:35:30.416 --> 00:35:32.678
in pursuit of telling the whole story

1070
00:35:32.678 --> 00:35:35.891
behind what it takes to heal cancer and other diseases.

1071
00:35:35.891 --> 00:35:38.280
Until next time, thanks for watching.

1072
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.622
