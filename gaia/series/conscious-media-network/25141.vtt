00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
It's been said

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.300 align:middle line:84%
in many spiritual traditions
that the human being is

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.880 align:middle line:84%
born with an open
connection to our soul

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.250 align:middle line:84%
with remembrances
from our deep past.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Over time, however, we
lose that direct connection

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.010 align:middle line:84%
through societal and parental
programming and expectations.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.590 align:middle line:90%
We slowly begin to conform.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Our dreams begin to close
down, and we no longer

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.560 align:middle line:84%
remember where we go at night
when the spirit leaves the body

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.020 align:middle line:84%
to refresh itself, gain
knowledge, and connect

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.480 align:middle line:90%
with other souls.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Jim Self has had the unique
benefit of never shutting down.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Every night he goes to
his soul's home place

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.300 align:middle line:84%
and meets with beings
and ascended masters who

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.970 align:middle line:84%
have shown him how life
in the cosmos works,

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.810 align:middle line:84%
including what this great
shift means in very real terms.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.350 align:middle line:90%
This is a fascinating story.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Jim, thank you for driving
all the way up to Sedona

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.080 align:middle line:90%
to meet us.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.790 align:middle line:84%
I think everybody
resonates really well

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.267 align:middle line:90%
in these beautiful red rocks.

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>>JIM SELF: Oh, yes.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.120 align:middle line:90%
Sedona's a great place.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is indeed.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And you've had an interesting
path, because on one hand,

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.310 align:middle line:84%
you're a very intelligent,
grounded, practical person that

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.880 align:middle line:84%
started a life in politics
at a very young age.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Pretty amazing.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yes, it was.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: City council,
San Jose, at 26.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Right.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did anyone
trust you to vote you

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.990 align:middle line:90%
into office at that age?

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Well, if you
know about San Jose,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.720 align:middle line:84%
San Jose used to be the third
richest agricultural valley

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.230 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And then they built
houses over it.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And when I started playing
in the politics side of it,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.470 align:middle line:84%
we had triple
sessions in schools.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And so people would buy
this wonderful house

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.182 align:middle line:84%
in this nice orchard, and
they'd get into the house,

00:01:53.182 --> 00:01:54.640 align:middle line:84%
and all of sudden
a new house would

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.530 align:middle line:84%
be next door and
across the street.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.830 align:middle line:90%
It was a ridiculous thing.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very
nice transition to be

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.480 align:middle line:84%
able to move from the old
guard who ran everything

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.590 align:middle line:84%
to a whole new grouping
of people coming in.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.810 align:middle line:90%
And it was a nice fit.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.309 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Still,
there was something

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:12.940 align:middle line:84%
that you were exuding that
allowed this to happen.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And let's back into that a
little bit, because anyone

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.256 align:middle line:84%
watching you right now,
you have an unusual amount

00:02:18.256 --> 00:02:19.630 align:middle line:84%
of light coming
out of your eyes.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.250 align:middle line:84%
Granted, you have lights
on you, but even when

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.530 align:middle line:84%
the lights weren't on you, you
have a lot of light coming out

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.330 align:middle line:90%
of your eyes.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.714 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about dream
time and who you really are.

00:02:26.714 --> 00:02:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Well, you know,
one of the things that

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:84%
happens when people come into
a body, born into a body,

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.270 align:middle line:90%
you know everything.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.590 align:middle line:84%
That soft spot on the
top of your head, that's

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.080 align:middle line:90%
the connection to the creator.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.460 align:middle line:90%
You're still connected.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you begin to listen to
mom, dad, preacher, minister,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.360 align:middle line:90%
teacher.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And you say, OK, I'm the little
one, they're the big ones,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.950 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
do what they say.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.020 align:middle line:90%
And you begin to shut that down.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.540 align:middle line:90%
Also, people are very connected.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.370 align:middle line:84%
They're clairvoyant,
they're clairsentient,

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.630 align:middle line:90%
they're clairaudient.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.110 align:middle line:84%
They have a very full
connection to themselves

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.530 align:middle line:90%
and to the world around them.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And then we shut that down to
do what the big ones say to do.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, I
never shut them down.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's an awkward place,
because people listening

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.480 align:middle line:90%
are very sensitive.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of the
things that happens

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.790 align:middle line:84%
to people who don't
shut that down is they

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.260 align:middle line:90%
begin to be hiders in life.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260 align:middle line:84%
They're very sensitive
to the energy

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.880 align:middle line:84%
and to the feelings, the
emotions of other people.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And so that gets to
be very challenging

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.690 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of people.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.120 align:middle line:84%
For me, it didn't seem
to affect me as much.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And the path I'm on just
allowed me to continue

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.920 align:middle line:90%
to walk through that.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And then things
like city council

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.724 align:middle line:84%
in San Jose and
building corporations

00:03:36.724 --> 00:03:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and the many other things
that I've been able to do,

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.860 align:middle line:84%
they were just learning
points along the way

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.720 align:middle line:84%
to begin to understand
this space that I

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.015 align:middle line:90%
get to play in now.

00:03:45.015 --> 00:03:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's really
what life is, if we all

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.160 align:middle line:90%
understood it that way.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.147 align:middle line:84%
It's all just an
experiment, a playground,

00:03:50.147 --> 00:03:51.355 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to call it.

00:03:51.355 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Very much.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you've
always known that.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So you approached
each of these things

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.580 align:middle line:84%
with the type of boldness the
average individual might have

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.370 align:middle line:84%
lost because of all the
other voices in their heads

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.060 align:middle line:84%
that suppress the boldness
that we are innately.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Well, I would
like to say yes.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.190 align:middle line:84%
But I have had my
own stuff in life.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.870 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's got their stuff.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.890 align:middle line:90%
And so to a great extent--

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.980 align:middle line:90%
see, you're always on your path.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.345 align:middle line:84%
That path is something that's
very predetermined by you.

00:04:19.345 --> 00:04:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Usually when I say that, people
jump up and go, what about free

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:22.770 align:middle line:90%
will?

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Well it fits very well,
that path that you walk.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.070 align:middle line:84%
You've created it to have all of
these experiences in your life.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.700 align:middle line:84%
The "free will"
piece is how do you

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.280 align:middle line:90%
choose to experience your path?

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you start to
recognize that you choose,

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.910 align:middle line:90%
there's no victims.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.740 align:middle line:84%
You either turn away from your
path or you stay on your path.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.500 align:middle line:84%
You begin to look
at what you want.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.410 align:middle line:84%
There is always
a boldness in it.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.980 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes people get knocked
down because you're not OK,

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.320 align:middle line:90%
the world around you says.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And we believe that to
some plus or minus extent.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And so in my reality,
I believed it.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.300 align:middle line:90%
People said, you're not OK.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.585 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You
bought into it too?

00:04:58.585 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Of course.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.220 align:middle line:90%
Everybody buys into it.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.470 align:middle line:84%
But it's beginning to recognize
that you can't be not OK.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.400 align:middle line:84%
See, it's really an
impossible thing to be not OK.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.990 align:middle line:84%
You, this internal guidance
system right here is always OK.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.670 align:middle line:84%
But what we do is we look
at that external world--

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.010 align:middle line:84%
mom, dad, teacher,
minister-- and they say,

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.290 align:middle line:84%
this is what we know and
this is what the truth is,

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.720 align:middle line:90%
and this is how you do it.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.560 align:middle line:90%
And then we follow that path.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And we continue to look
to our external world

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.090 align:middle line:84%
for our own validation
and our truths.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.240 align:middle line:90%
And that doesn't work.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And so one of two
things happens.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Either you're very sensitive
and you get pushed away

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and you say I'm not
OK and I don't fit

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.230 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not part of
that, or you shut it down

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.265 align:middle line:84%
in many ways and step into
it, and just boldly go.

00:05:46.265 --> 00:05:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think that's a good
point you make, because I mean,

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.320 align:middle line:84%
even in my own life, I've
been in media since I

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.950 align:middle line:84%
was a kid, basically,
in my mid, early 20s.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was so shy I
would have gnawed off

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.200 align:middle line:84%
an arm before I would have
raised my hand in class.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.820 align:middle line:90%
And I was terrified to do this.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.380 align:middle line:90%
I did it on a dare.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And yet if you can push
through, like you say,

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.050 align:middle line:84%
it's not that the fear
might not show itself.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you can go there
anyway, that's part

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.640 align:middle line:84%
of that journey of
boldness, isn't it?

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Very much so.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's a particular piece
where people lose quite often.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.560 align:middle line:84%
There's an aspect, this
inner guidance system,

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.710 align:middle line:84%
that you simply know
this is my truth.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And you know when
it's not your truth.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, when
you start to play

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.000 align:middle line:84%
the game of the external world,
do money, do fame, do whatever

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.640 align:middle line:84%
it may be for you,
we have a tendency

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.384 align:middle line:84%
to shut that internal
guidance system down.

00:06:40.384 --> 00:06:41.550 align:middle line:90%
It's like, kind of be quiet.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.633 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to hear this.

00:06:42.633 --> 00:06:45.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm on my path, I'm having
success or whatever.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And we don't listen
to our own truths.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.510 align:middle line:84%
What this shift of
consciousness is about

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.840 align:middle line:84%
is this internal guidance
system is now becoming

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.906 align:middle line:90%
the compass that's driving you.

00:06:55.906 --> 00:06:56.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to
backtrack a little bit

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.090 align:middle line:90%
because we didn't go into it.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:07.430 align:middle line:84%
You've had this extraordinary
ability that is very rare.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.840 align:middle line:84%
When you go into dream time,
into the other dimensions

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.310 align:middle line:84%
that night, you actually have
recall when you come back.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us what
you're doing over there,

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.170 align:middle line:84%
and also how that information
may have interfaced

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.600 align:middle line:84%
with putting you on your
path, and also making

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.760 align:middle line:84%
some of the other
earthly decisions

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.220 align:middle line:84%
you've made up to
what you're doing now.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: I can't do that.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.040 align:middle line:84%
See, one of the
things that happens,

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.500 align:middle line:90%
every night you go home.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.390 align:middle line:90%
Everybody goes home every night.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.720 align:middle line:84%
You lay the body down and
you say I'm going to sleep.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.470 align:middle line:84%
YOU begin to disconnect the
emotional, mental, spiritual

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.540 align:middle line:90%
body from the physical body.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:90%
And you go home.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And as the process
of going home,

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.200 align:middle line:84%
you pass through a dream
space, the astral plane,

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.820 align:middle line:90%
as people describe it.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.840 align:middle line:90%
That's not home.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.230 align:middle line:84%
That's just a place that
you get to also play.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:08:00.410 align:middle line:84%
But when you go home, it's like
a fine flute or a single candle

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:01.310 align:middle line:90%
burning.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.080 align:middle line:90%
It's so quiet and calm.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's in that
focused attention point

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.540 align:middle line:90%
that you remember yourself.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.860 align:middle line:90%
You remember everything.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And in that space,
it's an amazing place.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.710 align:middle line:84%
The great beings that people
would attach to or have

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:16.700 align:middle line:90%
reference to--

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.610 align:middle line:84%
the Jesus, the
Buddha, the Metatrons,

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.260 align:middle line:90%
the archangel Michael--

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.340 align:middle line:90%
they're all there.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.990 align:middle line:90%
They all sit at that table.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And the other ones
that are there

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.380 align:middle line:84%
are the "yous,"
the you and "mes."

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:32.090 align:middle line:84%
We sit at that table, too,
fully engaged in that process.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.630 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is when you
come back to the body,

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.947 align:middle line:84%
and when you separate it,
there's the acupuncture points.

00:08:39.947 --> 00:08:41.780 align:middle line:84%
See, this is very
interesting because that's

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.500 align:middle line:84%
the docking points between the
emotional and the mental body.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're little
magnetic vortexes,

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.720 align:middle line:84%
and they start to shut down,
and you begin to go home.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.340 align:middle line:84%
But when you come back and
you reconnect into that body,

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.840 align:middle line:84%
this is the point
where most people

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.490 align:middle line:84%
remember their
dreams is when you're

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.740 align:middle line:90%
coming back into the body.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.840 align:middle line:84%
But you pass through
that astral aspect.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.640 align:middle line:90%
And that's not your dream.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.380 align:middle line:90%
That's not where home is.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.730 align:middle line:90%
That's just another place.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.970 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as you
re-enter that body

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.480 align:middle line:84%
space, where you
left off yesterday,

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.080 align:middle line:90%
you pick right back up.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's like going from that
single flute of quietness,

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:23.570 align:middle line:84%
that single tone, back to
the Star-spangled Banner.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.990 align:middle line:84%
All the noise of yesterday
clicks right back in,

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.370 align:middle line:90%
and people forget.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:33.930 align:middle line:84%
In my reality, part of my path
is to remember that space.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.900 align:middle line:84%
So I can come back and say
look, this is how this works.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.150 align:middle line:90%
These are how dimensions work.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.090 align:middle line:84%
This is how this pathway
or this shift works.

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So the question, though, what
do you do when you go there,

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.950 align:middle line:84%
is a very difficult one to
answer because the reference

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.390 align:middle line:90%
points are different.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you start playing
in this fifth, sixth, seventh

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.230 align:middle line:84%
dimensional reality, it's a
completely different realm

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.030 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:03.950 align:middle line:84%
So the bridging doesn't happen
comfortably in language.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And part of my
wonderful journey is

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.890 align:middle line:84%
I have enough awareness
of what happens there

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.350 align:middle line:84%
in that I can
bring into language

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.010 align:middle line:84%
and then speak to this
shift of consciousness.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
articulately as well.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And just continuing on that
dream theme for a moment,

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.330 align:middle line:84%
this is very much
as I understand it,

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:28.190 align:middle line:84%
although I can rarely remember
anything from that quiet time.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And I've often felt
that when you're

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:33.200 align:middle line:84%
passing back through that
little astral thing, which is--

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.310 align:middle line:90%
it's recognizable.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a very close dimension to
earth, people that you know.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:40.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you might be hooking
up with individual energies

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.640 align:middle line:84%
or even individuals in
astral form, and maybe even

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.150 align:middle line:84%
bringing back through some
understanding of something

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.330 align:middle line:84%
that you're balancing within
the being via the feelings that

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.980 align:middle line:84%
are played out in that little
drama realm or human realm.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: The astral plane is
a very interesting aspect.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.760 align:middle line:84%
It is part of the
fourth dimension.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.200 align:middle line:84%
It is a place where things
happen in a different time

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.370 align:middle line:90%
configuration.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.370 align:middle line:84%
You know you've had dreams
where somebody from your past

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:13.040 align:middle line:84%
and somebody from your future,
they're in the same dream

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.580 align:middle line:90%
and it's very consistent.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.860 align:middle line:90%
You don't think much about that.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:84%
But the astral plane is
a very fascinating place,

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:23.090 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be a
troubling place for many

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:26.240 align:middle line:84%
as we go on this shift, because
one of the things that happens

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.210 align:middle line:84%
in the astral plane
is what you think is

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.150 align:middle line:90%
what you get as you think it.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.670 align:middle line:84%
But also, the astral
plane is fascinating

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.490 align:middle line:84%
because depending on
the life you live here,

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:41.570 align:middle line:84%
if you are a person that has
lots of negative thoughts

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:84%
and lots of drama, when you go
through into that astral plane,

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.960 align:middle line:90%
something very specific happens.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:52.190 align:middle line:84%
You see, thoughts are electrical
and emotions are magnetic.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Very important piece
of information.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And so how you think, and then
how you bind your thoughts

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.270 align:middle line:90%
to emotions--

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:00.890 align:middle line:84%
I hate that over
there, and you feel

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:03.320 align:middle line:84%
that anger or that resentment
or whatever it may be--

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.000 align:middle line:84%
or I love this wonderful thing,
and it's airy and it's fluid.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000 align:middle line:84%
If you ever notice, thoughts
that you think that are heavy,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.840 align:middle line:84%
angry, resentful,
troubling, worrying,

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.965 align:middle line:84%
they linger a very long
time in your awareness,

00:12:17.965 --> 00:12:19.390 align:middle line:90%
in many people's awareness.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's hell.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: You are very accurate.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:23.310 align:middle line:90%
That's hell.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's hell in a moment
where I'll point to.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.630 align:middle line:84%
What happens is when you
hold those thoughts here,

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and then you pass
into your sleep space,

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:37.640 align:middle line:84%
those magnetic thoughts
of resentment, let's say,

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.640 align:middle line:84%
that thought is
such that it anchors

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:45.920 align:middle line:84%
to all the thoughts ever thought
that had that same thought

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.810 align:middle line:90%
and emotional configuration.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:50.570 align:middle line:84%
So you just
magnetically get pulled

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:56.270 align:middle line:84%
to a scripting that is very
much like what you think.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:00.140 align:middle line:84%
But where it becomes hell
is very accurate statement.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.610 align:middle line:90%
And what you do is--

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.760 align:middle line:84%
in fact, they've done a study
on people who are in prisons.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
common things they

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:10.100 align:middle line:84%
say is the thing I'm most
unhappy about in my life

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:11.940 align:middle line:90%
is when I go to sleep.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to go to sleep.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's sad.

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: The reason being is
when I hold anger, resentment

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.270 align:middle line:84%
murder, rape,
incest, and then I go

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:23.430 align:middle line:84%
to sleep, guess
what I experience?

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:27.020 align:middle line:84%
So what is that astral
plane that's challenging

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.170 align:middle line:84%
is the heaviest, ugliest
thoughts, thought,

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:34.310 align:middle line:84%
that have never been
manifested by you.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:38.480 align:middle line:84%
They sit in that level of
the astral plane, the heavier

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.250 align:middle line:90%
part of the astral plane.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And when you go to
sleep, you begin

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:46.550 align:middle line:84%
to magnetically connect
into all the other thoughts

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.350 align:middle line:90%
that others have thought.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's a place that
you don't want to be.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's not
just your thought frequency.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.130 align:middle line:84%
It's everyone who's had
similar frequency of thought.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Every thought.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:56.258 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Feeding that field.

00:13:56.258 --> 00:13:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Every thought
ever thought like that.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:03.050 align:middle line:84%
When it's manifested, you bring
it into the third dimension

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:04.250 align:middle line:90%
and experience it.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.740 align:middle line:84%
But where it has
not been manifested,

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:10.130 align:middle line:84%
you begin to access that
when you go to sleep.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:12.074 align:middle line:90%
The challenge for the shift--

00:14:12.074 --> 00:14:13.740 align:middle line:84%
we're a little bit
out of context here--

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.790 align:middle line:84%
but the third dimension,
which we can talk about,

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.200 align:middle line:90%
is going to dissolve.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.310 align:middle line:90%
It's going away.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.350 align:middle line:90%
It cannot continue to exist.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.840 align:middle line:84%
But the fourth dimension
isn't going to go away.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So when you begin to play in
that fourth dimensional space

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:31.430 align:middle line:84%
and you hold those really
negative, ugly thoughts,

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.320 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
begin to experience

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.380 align:middle line:90%
what you think as you think.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to be
a challenge for some.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.440 align:middle line:84%
See, the flip side
of it, though,

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.670 align:middle line:84%
is when you think about puppy
dogs and little children

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.590 align:middle line:84%
and wonderful things
and butterflies

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.290 align:middle line:84%
and beautiful
Sedonas of the world,

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.290 align:middle line:84%
those are fleeting
thoughts in a way,

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:84%
because that magnetism
is not dense.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.460 align:middle line:90%
It's very fluid.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And so you have a nice
feeling with those thoughts,

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:03.240 align:middle line:84%
but you don't stay focused
on them a long time.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.110 align:middle line:84%
So when you begin to have
that kind of construct

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:09.470 align:middle line:84%
and you go home at night,
you pass into that area

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.530 align:middle line:84%
much more quickly than you
do into those places which

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.390 align:middle line:84%
you don't identify with
those heavier thoughts.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.499 align:middle line:84%
Now you've opened up three
or four different places

00:15:19.499 --> 00:15:20.540 align:middle line:90%
we're going to go anyway.

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
let you guide this.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.250 align:middle line:84%
You've just talked
about, essentially,

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.300 align:middle line:84%
the beginning point of
what this shift is, right?

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Now another
understanding I have--

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.610 align:middle line:84%
and we're going back just a
little bit to that dream state

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:38.270 align:middle line:84%
interfacing with this fourth
dimensional aspect we pass

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.550 align:middle line:84%
through coming back
from our home at night--

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:45.650 align:middle line:84%
is that as the third dimensional
frequencies start dissolving,

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:48.140 align:middle line:84%
there might be some
confusion with individuals

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.690 align:middle line:84%
as to their time
in the dream state

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:54.090 align:middle line:90%
versus their physical reality.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And some people may
already be experiencing

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:84%
this, whether it's positive
or whether it's heavy.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Well, let's back into
that with some structure.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:11.600 align:middle line:84%
So this thing called dimensions
is a very interesting aspect.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.290 align:middle line:84%
So a dimension-- let's start
with this third dimension,

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.360 align:middle line:90%
which I'm saying is dissolving.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.590 align:middle line:90%
It's going away.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, the dimension is not
the chair we're sitting

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:25.250 align:middle line:84%
and the house that surrounds
us, the tree outside the window.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:28.650 align:middle line:84%
That's form, that's
physical form.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:33.800 align:middle line:84%
But what this third dimension
is is a very dense reality,

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.170 align:middle line:90%
and it's very structured.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.490 align:middle line:90%
It's conditional.

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:40.970 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing in the third
dimension that's unconditional.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.100 align:middle line:84%
You have to get into
the fourth and fifth

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.080 align:middle line:84%
before you experience
unconditional.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.960 align:middle line:90%
So conditional, it's very rigid.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.840 align:middle line:84%
There's not a lot of flexibility
in this third dimension.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.660 align:middle line:84%
It deals in things
like always and never.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.570 align:middle line:84%
She's never going
to be trustworthy.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:59.870 align:middle line:84%
I can never-- he always is
going to be this or that.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.600 align:middle line:84%
See, there's no
flexibility in that.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Very rigid.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.160 align:middle line:84%
There's also a component
in the third dimension that

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.650 align:middle line:84%
keeps us very much in
the third dimension,

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.869 align:middle line:84%
and that's how we
understand time.

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Time is a very
fascinating thing.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:17.390 align:middle line:90%
Time is an application.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:20.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not a fixed creation.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.480 align:middle line:84%
So in the third dimension,
the time that we play in

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:27.089 align:middle line:84%
is called past, present,
future, and then you die.

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:30.950 align:middle line:84%
But if you look around and you
listen to people speaking, what

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:35.310 align:middle line:84%
you hear them talking
about is not present time,

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:38.360 align:middle line:84%
but this happened to
me once upon a time,

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.980 align:middle line:84%
and I hope it never
happens to me again.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Or they said if I would,
therefore I will be.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.590 align:middle line:84%
So when you listen to
people, very seldom

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.980 align:middle line:84%
do you hear them
speaking in present time

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.170 align:middle line:90%
in a third dimensional reality.

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:57.180 align:middle line:84%
There is a slight
moment of present time.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's called
reactionary present time.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:03.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh no, this
wasn't supposed to happen.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.310 align:middle line:90%
Are you in present time?

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.970 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:06.020 align:middle line:90%
Are you a happy camper?

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.920 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm in reaction.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.720 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.230 align:middle line:90%
So that's more or less the box.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:18.690 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is, there is
no past and there is no future.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:23.210 align:middle line:84%
But there is a past present
moment that you experienced,

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:25.520 align:middle line:84%
and there will be a
future present moment

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.960 align:middle line:90%
that you will experience.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.590 align:middle line:84%
But when people play in
the past, a lot of times

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:33.650 align:middle line:84%
you say, how are you, and
people go, oh, I'm fine.

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, somehow, I'm fine and
I'm fine don't match up.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.740 align:middle line:84%
When you say, well,
what's going on?

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, my husband
died 20 years ago.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:43.580 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's still sad for me.

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're sad in
the present moment.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.930 align:middle line:84%
So emotions can only occur
in the present moment.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:19:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And an event in your past
is a piece of information.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:06.170 align:middle line:84%
So when you keep re-living
your past moment over and over,

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.730 align:middle line:84%
you get the same
thing over and over.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.510 align:middle line:90%
And so that's time-related.

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:13.850 align:middle line:84%
But if I said, oh, I
know your husband died.

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:14.910 align:middle line:90%
That's too bad.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:17.960 align:middle line:84%
But how was that lunch you had
yesterday at that restaurant?

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.270 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it was really great.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Are they in that past
moment at that moment?

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.720 align:middle line:90%
No, they're now very present.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And that present
time moment is kind

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.590 align:middle line:90%
of a fourth dimensional space.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.300 align:middle line:84%
You live in both of
these at the same time.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And so in the fourth
dimension, present time

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:39.000 align:middle line:90%
is a very big piece.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.570 align:middle line:84%
But what makes present
time so important

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:46.160 align:middle line:84%
as a time application is when
you're living in the past

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.270 align:middle line:84%
or living in the future,
you don't have choice.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:51.740 align:middle line:90%
You have reaction.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:56.510 align:middle line:84%
The moment you get into present
time, then you have choice.

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's in that
choice you begin

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.950 align:middle line:90%
to create different structures.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Fourth dimension has a
consideration called paradox.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And in simple terms,
paradox means what was true

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:12.330 align:middle line:84%
just a minute ago may
not be true right now.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So in the fourth
dimension, you get

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.640 align:middle line:84%
to get out of many of those
restricted, non-flexible

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.610 align:middle line:90%
structures.

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:23.260 align:middle line:84%
So she shows up at your
door 20 years later

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.510 align:middle line:90%
and you say, oh, I remember you.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:26.840 align:middle line:90%
You were the bad one.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.200 align:middle line:84%
But what they may
have done is showed up

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.720 align:middle line:84%
at your doorstep to say
I'm so sorry for what

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.320 align:middle line:90%
I did 20 years ago.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you can have
flexibility, you

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.290 align:middle line:90%
begin to change your reality.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.510 align:middle line:84%
That simple piece
is what's going

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:43.030 align:middle line:84%
to allow everybody to step
into this next dimensional

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:43.930 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as you
say, this is a choice.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.760 align:middle line:84%
We have to make this
choice in the moment.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:50.560 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.685 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: It's in the moment.

00:20:51.685 --> 00:20:53.980 align:middle line:90%
You only have the moment.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.870 align:middle line:84%
You have history from
your past, and you

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:59.370 align:middle line:84%
have creative opportunity
in your future.

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:03.232 align:middle line:84%
But you can only make the
future happen in the moment.

00:21:03.232 --> 00:21:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I bring that
up because a lot of people

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.760 align:middle line:84%
think that we're here, we chose
to incarnate into this time,

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.480 align:middle line:90%
it's going to happen to us.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.510 align:middle line:84%
But actually, there
is a participation

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:14.410 align:middle line:90%
that needs to occur.

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:16.610 align:middle line:84%
There are choices
that need to occur.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:18.725 align:middle line:90%
And you just spoke to that.

00:21:18.725 --> 00:21:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that's
very disconcerting for a lot

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.720 align:middle line:90%
of people right now as we--

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.850 align:middle line:84%
again, I want to keep
this journey of going

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.680 align:middle line:84%
through these
dimensional fields intact

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.140 align:middle line:84%
as we move through them
in this conversation.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.770 align:middle line:84%
But one of them that is
disconcerting in the moment

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.710 align:middle line:90%
is that people reach for words.

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.639 align:middle line:90%
All ages, not Alzheimer's.

00:21:38.639 --> 00:21:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about
this in your book,

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.030 align:middle line:84%
and when I read your book,
I thought, oh my god.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.330 align:middle line:84%
You pick up something
so ordinary.

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:48.310 align:middle line:84%
You have it in your head,
picture in your head,

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:50.110 align:middle line:84%
you're going to go do
this, you can't even

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.660 align:middle line:84%
articulate the word
for that common thing.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us
what's happening?

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yeah.

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:58.600 align:middle line:84%
See, this shift, the
universe understands

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.980 align:middle line:90%
you don't remember who you are.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.550 align:middle line:90%
So let me identify it this way.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:06.370 align:middle line:84%
So you're walking along and
you're having a good day,

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and somebody comes
along and insults you.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And you first have
a thought, oh, that

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.600 align:middle line:90%
doesn't sound very good.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.480 align:middle line:84%
But you immediately
have an emotion.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And in that emotion you say, oh,
this isn't a very good thing.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And then you try to figure
out what to do with that.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.750 align:middle line:84%
You're not attractive, you don't
fit, you're not intelligent,

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:27.610 align:middle line:84%
you're never going to
amount to anything.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:29.380 align:middle line:90%
You get insulted.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.509 align:middle line:84%
And you've got this insult,
and what do I do with it?

00:22:32.509 --> 00:22:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And you go to your best
friend and you say,

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:35.830 align:middle line:84%
somebody just said
I'm not smart,

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:38.080 align:middle line:90%
and they go, they were right.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Now what do you do with it,
because you have no place

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:41.620 align:middle line:90%
to dump it off.

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:46.130 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is we simply say,
I can't handle this anymore.

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:48.640 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to put it over
here in this little box called

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.150 align:middle line:90%
denial.

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:54.205 align:middle line:84%
And then you keep looking at
it and it keeps coming back.

00:22:54.205 --> 00:22:55.330 align:middle line:90%
So you make a deal with it.

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:58.390 align:middle line:84%
You say, if I put you
back here in this place

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.330 align:middle line:84%
called unconsciousness,
I'll make a deal with you.

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:03.670 align:middle line:84%
I'll never go visit
that spot again

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.180 align:middle line:84%
if you don't jump out
and bite me in the butt.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:07.410 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Now what happens is
we have collected

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.490 align:middle line:90%
a whole lot of who we are not.

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:15.490 align:middle line:84%
See, going back to what
I said in the beginning,

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.130 align:middle line:90%
you can't be not OK.

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:21.670 align:middle line:84%
But you can accept other
people's gifts of you're

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:22.750 align:middle line:90%
not OK.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And what we have a tendency
to do is we wear those coats,

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:29.710 align:middle line:84%
and we simply walk
around defining ourselves

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:31.720 align:middle line:90%
by I'm not OK.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.090 align:middle line:90%
But you can't be not OK.

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So as this shift unfolds, why
you're losing your memory,

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.620 align:middle line:84%
is the universe knows that
you don't remember where you

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.320 align:middle line:90%
stored all those I'm not OKs.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And in this journey, you can't
take your baggage with you.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.860 align:middle line:84%
From this third
dimension, moving

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:53.020 align:middle line:84%
to this fifth
dimensional space, you

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:56.410 align:middle line:84%
can't be not OK in
the fifth dimension.

00:23:56.410 --> 00:24:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So you and the universe
are clearing away

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:03.430 align:middle line:84%
a lot of those patterns
that you hold onto that

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:05.380 align:middle line:90%
simply say I'm not OK.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And so this transformation we're
in, you are losing your memory.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.544 align:middle line:84%
And the memory is
really, I'm not OK.

00:24:14.544 --> 00:24:15.460 align:middle line:90%
And it's disappearing.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.690 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes the part
you're asking about--

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and I've had this
holding a spoon,

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:23.330 align:middle line:90%
and it's like, there's a--

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:24.140 align:middle line:90%
can't find it.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.400 align:middle line:90%
No matter what.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.100 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
whether you're a child

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.550 align:middle line:90%
or an 85-year-old person.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:31.810 align:middle line:84%
It's as you say,
it's not Alzheimer's.

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:36.340 align:middle line:84%
You are losing your
memories of I'm not OK.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:39.640 align:middle line:84%
If you think about your past,
you've had lots of experiences

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.420 align:middle line:84%
where you've been insulted or
you've embarrassed yourself.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.240 align:middle line:90%
Those were experiences.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.900 align:middle line:84%
But if you really
think about it,

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.770 align:middle line:84%
many times those
experiences happened,

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and they took one
second or two seconds.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And yet you define the rest
of your life by I'm not OK.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.380 align:middle line:84%
That's being cleared
from your reality.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where
part of this memory.

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If it drags the
spoon with it, there you go.

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: And what happens is,
because the brain and synaptics

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:10.960 align:middle line:84%
and the axons and all of
the aspects of the brain--

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.460 align:middle line:84%
and that whole field of memory,
which sits in your energy field

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.770 align:middle line:84%
far more than it
sits in your head---

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:19.410 align:middle line:84%
as pieces are removed,
those connections

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:21.247 align:middle line:90%
get disconnected, spoon.

00:25:21.247 --> 00:25:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And you think about it for a
minute, and all of a sudden

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.320 align:middle line:90%
it's like, oh, yeah, spoon.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So all that reconnection
is going on all the time.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:33.097 align:middle line:84%
But you are losing the
memory of who you are not.

00:25:33.097 --> 00:25:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're not
losing your mind,

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:35.690 align:middle line:90%
you're losing your memory.

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Correct.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's a good distinction.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:42.810 align:middle line:84%
You're talking-- and I've heard
other people speak of this as

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:46.380 align:middle line:84%
well, moving from this third
dimensional consciousness

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.740 align:middle line:84%
into the fourth, into the fifth
dimensional consciousness.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Now I think where
some people who've

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.420 align:middle line:84%
contemplated this
become confused

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:59.640 align:middle line:84%
is the understanding, this fine
understanding of the difference

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:04.830 align:middle line:84%
between dimensions and
vibrational frequencies

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.300 align:middle line:90%
and densities.

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.730 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean your
world suddenly disappears,

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:11.550 align:middle line:84%
but your consciousness
has shifted.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:13.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Correct, exactly.

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if you'd
explain that a bit.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Sure.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.870 align:middle line:84%
So the couch, the chair
really doesn't go away

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:22.620 align:middle line:84%
in this fifth
dimensional reality.

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:26.940 align:middle line:84%
You live in a third and a
fourth dimension the time,

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.520 align:middle line:84%
and you're stepping
into a fifth dimension.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.500 align:middle line:90%
The fifth dimension is lighter.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.540 align:middle line:90%
It's airier, if you would.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:37.620 align:middle line:84%
In the fifth dimension
words like safety and trust

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.310 align:middle line:90%
do not exist.

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:43.340 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing unsafe and
there's nothing to distrust.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:47.370 align:middle line:84%
In that fifth dimension, it's
co-creation, cooperation,

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:50.370 align:middle line:84%
it's beauty and well-being
and reverence and kindness

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:54.030 align:middle line:84%
and graciousness, all
those wonderful words.

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:58.980 align:middle line:84%
But those words are not
intellectual spoken words.

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:02.250 align:middle line:84%
They are felt. And so
in that place where

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:07.050 align:middle line:84%
you live graciousness, you
live certainty, command,

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:09.630 align:middle line:90%
you live capableness--

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:11.400 align:middle line:84%
when you begin to
live in those words,

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.310 align:middle line:84%
you start to move
around very differently.

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:16.950 align:middle line:84%
In a third dimension,
you know all those words.

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Capable, certain, happy,
gracious, commanding.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:24.510 align:middle line:84%
But how often do we
live those words?

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And see, now we're
talking about the path

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.160 align:middle line:84%
into the fifth
dimension because when

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:33.610 align:middle line:84%
you can sit and feel
happy, or if I say,

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.600 align:middle line:90%
have you ever been certain?

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.346 align:middle line:84%
And oh, yeah, I've
been certain, you say.

00:27:38.346 --> 00:27:40.470 align:middle line:84%
But if I say, no, wait a
minute, just take a breath

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:43.480 align:middle line:84%
and feel certain, all of a
sudden it's like, oh, OK,

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.240 align:middle line:90%
certain.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Something happens in the
physiology when you change

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:52.080 align:middle line:90%
the frequency of thought.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Then you begin to
get to a place where

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:58.800 align:middle line:84%
you start to structure that
thought into an every moment

00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.610 align:middle line:90%
action.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And you find, also,
when you're feeling

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:07.230 align:middle line:84%
capable or certain, pleased,
there's a presence about you.

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And that presence
is in present time.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:13.290 align:middle line:84%
That's the place where you
command from well-being.

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's the pathway into
this fifth dimensional space.

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And shall
we assume that when

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:25.020 align:middle line:84%
we evolve our ourselves
into this fifth dimensional

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:29.010 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, that the
speed of creation changes?

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Oh, yes.

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:33.750 align:middle line:90%
It becomes instantaneous.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.810 align:middle line:84%
See, when you change
the time configuration,

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:38.970 align:middle line:84%
and you get away
from past and future,

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:44.010 align:middle line:84%
and you get into the present
time, where the game of time,

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.410 align:middle line:84%
in present time, there's
four layers of present time.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And each one becomes
more instantaneous.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And so as you step
into this, you're

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:56.880 align:middle line:84%
going to find also that time is
simultaneous and time is also

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.200 align:middle line:90%
circular.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And so there's places in these
present time configurations

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:06.390 align:middle line:84%
where, when you are very
present in your body,

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:09.840 align:middle line:84%
observing your reality,
and then choosing

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.450 align:middle line:84%
how you wish to interact
with that reality,

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:16.560 align:middle line:84%
that concept is very different
than shoot, ready, aim, or they

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.800 align:middle line:84%
said and so I'm going
to do what they said.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.230 align:middle line:84%
So when you start to get
into that construct where

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:25.680 align:middle line:84%
you can observe,
choose, and act,

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:29.550 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to play in
well-being, recognizing this is

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:32.190 align:middle line:84%
all about well-being, I
don't need to be angry,

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:35.460 align:middle line:84%
you can't take anger with you
into that fifth dimension.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:36.660 align:middle line:90%
It's too heavy.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like a big weight
in your hot air balloon.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.570 align:middle line:84%
The balloon will just go up
so high and it'll stall out.

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.100 align:middle line:84%
You have to get rid
of the I'm not OK's.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:46.950 align:middle line:84%
See, this is what the
universe is doing.

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:49.950 align:middle line:84%
It knows those heavy
rocks in your backpack

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:51.390 align:middle line:90%
have nothing to do with you.

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:53.765 align:middle line:84%
They're just gifts that others
have given you that you've

00:29:53.765 --> 00:29:55.140 align:middle line:90%
accepted to walk around with.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.080 align:middle line:84%
As they begin to
dissipate and go away,

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:03.150 align:middle line:84%
the ability to simply have
conversation without "Am I OK?"

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:05.460 align:middle line:90%
begins to be very fluid.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's in that
space that you're

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:09.060 align:middle line:84%
going to start to
find the ability

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:12.590 align:middle line:90%
to create more instantaneously.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Like, I'd like an
apple, and that apple's

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.480 align:middle line:90%
going to appear in your hand.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.750 align:middle line:90%
Very beautiful.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the human
beings that exist now.

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Certainly this
journey is perhaps

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.170 align:middle line:84%
proving to be a little
more challenging for people

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:31.260 align:middle line:84%
who were born a few decades
or several decades ago

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.210 align:middle line:84%
as the beginning
of these energies

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:34.440 align:middle line:90%
started making this shift.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So we're actually born
into the previous densities

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.100 align:middle line:90%
and constructs and boxes.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Yet we chose to be the first
ones in that generation that

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:51.510 align:middle line:84%
have chosen to go through this
metamorphosis from that density

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:53.240 align:middle line:84%
through to another
one, which is--

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.660 align:middle line:90%
that's a brave group of souls.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
next ones coming in, who--

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.390 align:middle line:84%
the energies are a little more
established, the new energies.

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Then you have the little
babies being born now.

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And can you talk a
little bit about what

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:08.790 align:middle line:84%
this has been like
from your observations

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:11.340 align:middle line:84%
of these different generations
that have chosen to come in

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:15.060 align:middle line:90%
at very specific times?

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: These beings, at
each one of those intervals,

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.580 align:middle line:84%
really it started back
in the late 1800s.

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.690 align:middle line:84%
It was an inkling of
thought of possibility.

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And some came, and
some performed,

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:28.916 align:middle line:90%
and some did what they did.

00:31:28.916 --> 00:31:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This were
the Rudolf Steiners

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:31.799 align:middle line:90%
and some of these individuals.

00:31:31.799 --> 00:31:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Nicola Teslas,
all of these great beings.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And yet they came
into a time where

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:41.010 align:middle line:84%
they came into a confrontation
with an ideology, a philosophy,

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:42.900 align:middle line:90%
money was a big piece.

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Not making it bad or
good, it was a philosophy

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:51.100 align:middle line:84%
in how we will create and
we will build great empires,

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.640 align:middle line:90%
some said.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.350 align:middle line:84%
The Rockefellers
and all of those

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:57.720 align:middle line:90%
did remarkably wonderful things.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:02.010 align:middle line:84%
But they did it from a place
that was not in that law of one

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:05.220 align:middle line:84%
where the first become the last
and the last become the first.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.410 align:middle line:90%
They did it with a break in it.

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Me, I'm going to get it for me,
and I don't care about them.

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we played
through that period of time

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:14.696 align:middle line:90%
setting this all up.

00:32:14.696 --> 00:32:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Lot of
resistance to the ones

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.970 align:middle line:90%
who came in with knowledge.

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Sure.

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:22.290 align:middle line:84%
So when Tesla showed up
and Edison showed up,

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:25.590 align:middle line:84%
and the guys with the money
said where do I make money,

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:27.660 align:middle line:84%
they weren't going to
make money from Tesla.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And if that had been
adapted, we would

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:35.080 align:middle line:84%
be having this conversation
back in the 40s.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.550 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't adapted,
and it wasn't integrated.

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And so that break,
where there was

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:42.630 align:middle line:84%
OK to have poor
and non-havingness,

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.730 align:middle line:84%
and it was OK to
not pay attention

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:49.020 align:middle line:84%
to women's rights and gay
rights and environmental rights.

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:51.200 align:middle line:84%
So we brought ourselves
to this place.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.910 align:middle line:84%
But as that was
happening, there was

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:55.340 align:middle line:84%
the you and me's
and many others that

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.840 align:middle line:84%
said we're going to
make a difference.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And so you had an
interval in 1920

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.230 align:middle line:84%
where there were some really
remarkable beings that

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:06.090 align:middle line:84%
came onto the planet and
said, I'll make a difference.

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:06.890 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:09.140 align:middle line:90%
Quietly they came and they went.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:14.040 align:middle line:84%
But starting in about 1945 a
very large grouping of beings

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:14.840 align:middle line:90%
came.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And many of them came
for different reasons.

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Many of them came with
very big purposes.

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And yet it was still an
inkling that maybe, just

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:27.320 align:middle line:84%
maybe something would
happen, because we

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:31.000 align:middle line:84%
have done this number of times
before, and in those past times

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.750 align:middle line:90%
we have not succeeded.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And so the intention was to
become this fully Christed

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:37.450 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:39.900 align:middle line:84%
That's not about a
man or a religion.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.470 align:middle line:90%
That's about an evolution.

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And we have not succeeded, and
we've ripped up that blueprint

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:47.910 align:middle line:90%
and we've tried again.

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And so this whole process
was another one of those.

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And that year 2000
was very magical.

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And you can read about in
Revelations, Ezekiel, Daniel

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:56.270 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And you had nine ways
to do yourself in,

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:01.610 align:middle line:84%
to rip up the blueprint,
to try once again.

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:05.930 align:middle line:84%
But in 1945, '46, that
grouping came into presence,

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:09.979 align:middle line:84%
and they came very much into
presence in the late 60s.

00:34:09.979 --> 00:34:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And you had the environmental
movements and the gay movements

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.770 align:middle line:84%
and all the various
movements, women's rights,

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:17.929 align:middle line:90%
where people just said, enough.

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And then, oddly enough,
that disappeared

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:22.370 align:middle line:84%
in the 70s and the
80s, and then money

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:24.080 align:middle line:90%
came back into the process.

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.670 align:middle line:90%
But make no mistake.

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Those that brought about the 60s
and 70s, they didn't go away.

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And now they're coming back
in lots of different ways.

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.679 align:middle line:84%
And they are making
a difference.

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:36.239 align:middle line:90%
These are big beings.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:40.969 align:middle line:84%
And in 1987, when the
harmonic convergence came,

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:44.060 align:middle line:84%
that was enormous because
that's the point in time where

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.159 align:middle line:90%
the new one started to come.

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And so you're watching
these kids today.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Their DNA is different,
their mental configurations

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:53.960 align:middle line:84%
are different,
their recognitions

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:57.120 align:middle line:84%
of where they came from
is conscious to them.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.000 align:middle line:84%
We just don't ask
them many times.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.410 align:middle line:84%
So their knowledge of who they
are is very ingrained in them.

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And now the newer kids,
the ones with autism

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and the ones that are broken
and obviously something's

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.610 align:middle line:90%
wrong, no, nothing's wrong.

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:14.250 align:middle line:84%
We just don't recognize the
capacity that they have.

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And if we were to recognize
it, we would have to change.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.360 align:middle line:90%
But now we're into the shift.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And the shift is, in fact,
going to occur in such a way

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:29.810 align:middle line:84%
that this grouping of great ones
that were quiet but basically

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:32.440 align:middle line:84%
made a difference
has come about.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing it now, and
more and more are waking up.

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And those are the leaders and
the teachers and the healers

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.790 align:middle line:84%
and the ones that said,
I can make a difference.

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And they never lost
that right here,

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:44.184 align:middle line:90%
in that space in their heart.

00:35:44.184 --> 00:35:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is a
challenging time, then,

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.710 align:middle line:84%
for the little ones
who've come in.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:50.280 align:middle line:84%
They have one foot still
in their home field

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.550 align:middle line:90%
and their other foot here.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:55.040 align:middle line:84%
It's almost-- in some
cases, as you say in autism,

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.946 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like it's
a premature stepping

00:35:57.946 --> 00:36:00.320 align:middle line:84%
into this world because the
world doesn't understand them

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.390 align:middle line:84%
and is not ready to embrace
everything that they

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:03.980 align:middle line:90%
have to offer just yet.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:10.370 align:middle line:84%
How do you see us bridging that
with these incredible young

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:12.230 align:middle line:90%
beings who are here now?

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:15.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: These incredible
young ones will take over,

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:19.359 align:middle line:84%
you know, and they know
what they're doing.

00:36:19.359 --> 00:36:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And see, it's an interesting
thing about these new ones

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:25.370 align:middle line:84%
because some of these have
never had bodies before.

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And these are big beings
coming from lots of places.

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And there are many who
have had bodies before,

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:34.640 align:middle line:84%
and they have the knowledge
to step right into things

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:38.030 align:middle line:84%
like governments
and corporations

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:40.310 align:middle line:84%
and basically say,
we're going to do this

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:43.700 align:middle line:84%
from that law of one,
where everybody counts.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And there's no greed, and
basically there's a philosophy

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:49.100 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to see,
you've started to see it,

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:51.920 align:middle line:90%
it's one plus one is three.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.470 align:middle line:84%
How do you take everything
to the high road?

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And when you play
in that philosophy--

00:36:56.770 --> 00:37:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and like our business,
we give away far more

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.820 align:middle line:84%
than we charge for, and
we give away substance

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:06.890 align:middle line:84%
because I know I'm
never going to see

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:08.870 align:middle line:84%
all those people
that I'm talking to

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:10.850 align:middle line:90%
in all these free lectures.

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:14.330 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't matter if
I get rewarded from well,

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:15.620 align:middle line:90%
give me your dollar.

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:19.030 align:middle line:84%
So that model is starting
to fall apart in the world.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:21.440 align:middle line:84%
The money model
is going to change

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.810 align:middle line:90%
to something really remarkable.

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:27.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's based on one
plus one is three.

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Take it to the high
road, give things away,

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:31.400 align:middle line:84%
and it comes back
to you in many ways.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.520 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're starting
to see in this shift.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.280 align:middle line:84%
But you're seeing people in
each one of those generations

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.540 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:41.030 align:middle line:84%
The ones that came in
the 40s, particularly,

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:43.580 align:middle line:84%
are making very major
things happen today,

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.064 align:middle line:84%
even though they're not
visible in many regards.

00:37:46.064 --> 00:37:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
for explaining that.

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a very beautiful
kind of gradation

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:52.400 align:middle line:90%
of the consciousness coming in.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And now when you're
working with people,

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:55.884 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've already
talked about what

00:37:55.884 --> 00:37:57.860 align:middle line:84%
the possibility for
each of us is now

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:01.670 align:middle line:84%
if we make that choice to
start moving into the clearer

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:05.210 align:middle line:84%
feelings, emotions, listening
to our internal self,

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:07.940 align:middle line:84%
moving into that fifth
dimensional consciousness.

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:10.850 align:middle line:84%
But in your work,
there are tools

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:12.980 align:middle line:90%
that you utilize to do this.

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And I know you can't
share everything here

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.670 align:middle line:84%
because we only have a
short bit of time together.

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Maybe just give us a glimpse
of some of those tools,

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:20.930 align:middle line:84%
and people can check in with
you later to find out more.

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Sure.

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:26.870 align:middle line:84%
See, what you're really
asking about in your evolution

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:29.030 align:middle line:84%
is something that
you're not taught

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:33.280 align:middle line:84%
in the system of your
education and your upbringing.

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So you're taught that
everything external to you

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.180 align:middle line:90%
is what drives your reality.

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And so we're starting to begin
to recognize no, that I count.

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big shift
for a lot of people,

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:49.310 align:middle line:84%
begin not I is the one really
important from the ego side.

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:53.190 align:middle line:84%
It's the place that I have value
is what's starting to happen.

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:55.400 align:middle line:84%
But in order to
begin to play there,

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.040 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that
helps is to recognize

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.890 align:middle line:84%
that energy, and the
vibration of energy

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:04.010 align:middle line:84%
and the vibration of words
and thoughts and emotions.

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:08.240 align:middle line:84%
If you understand what's
happening in and around you,

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:11.810 align:middle line:84%
and how to manage your
energy, you basically

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:13.940 align:middle line:84%
can step out of
all of these issues

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:15.560 align:middle line:84%
that you generally
are confronting

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:20.370 align:middle line:84%
in your external world where
they tell you you're OK or not.

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And so this energy field,
this aura around you,

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:26.060 align:middle line:90%
very, very important thing.

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:29.780 align:middle line:84%
In a way-- this is not a
truth that I'm going to say--

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.900 align:middle line:84%
but there's a point where
you stop and you start.

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Really, that's not accurate,
but for this purpose,

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:37.880 align:middle line:84%
if you can define where
the edge of your aura

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.430 align:middle line:84%
is, which is approximately
when you stick your hand out

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:42.390 align:middle line:84%
in front of you and
turn it this way,

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:44.690 align:middle line:84%
and if you can begin to
have a consideration that

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:49.010 align:middle line:84%
from this point
to me is who I am,

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and everything on the
other side of that

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:54.500 align:middle line:84%
is Shakespeare's
theater to entertain me,

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:58.160 align:middle line:84%
would that create a
concept and a perception

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:01.520 align:middle line:84%
differently than you
normally walk around with?

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it does, if you
can stay on your side.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
tools, very simple,

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:12.030 align:middle line:84%
we use the concept of a rose
that has lots of meaning.

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:13.940 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to
create an image of a

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:17.520 align:middle line:84%
rose right here on the
edge of your energy field,

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.400 align:middle line:84%
and know it goes all
the way around you

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.410 align:middle line:84%
so you're standing
inside of a circle,

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:27.350 align:middle line:84%
if you would, and this is
me and that's the theater.

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And the rule is you stay on your
side of the rose, more or less.

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:34.250 align:middle line:84%
If you can play
that game, it puts

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:39.320 align:middle line:84%
you one, into present time,
and two, it gives you choice.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Then you can observe,
choose, and decide

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:45.590 align:middle line:90%
on how you wish to act.

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Very gigantic shift
in people's reality.

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:51.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
happens to people is--

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:53.790 align:middle line:90%
I'll even go this far--

00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:58.100 align:middle line:84%
most of the thoughts that you
think and most of the beliefs

00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:01.130 align:middle line:84%
that you hold are
not even yours.

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And so how much time
do you pay attention

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:07.510 align:middle line:84%
to all that noise running
through your head all day long?

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And mostly it's other
people's thoughts

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:12.600 align:middle line:90%
moving through your space.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.000 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you
create this rose--

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.340 align:middle line:84%
and this is not a
wall or a keep out

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:20.780 align:middle line:84%
or a defense mechanism-- it
just simply says, this is me

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:22.134 align:middle line:90%
and that's the game.

00:41:22.134 --> 00:41:23.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The theater, yeah.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: And just by entertaining
that and holding it,

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:31.030 align:middle line:84%
an enormous amount of the
noise begins to stay out.

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Also, many people
are very empathetic.

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.080 align:middle line:90%
I feel you.

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.467 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens
is, I feel you--

00:41:38.467 --> 00:41:40.550 align:middle line:84%
in order to say that, I
have to be in present time

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:44.330 align:middle line:84%
going oh, yes, this is sad about
your 20-year-old husband that

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:45.200 align:middle line:90%
died.

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.720 align:middle line:90%
I feel your feelings.

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.310 align:middle line:90%
Empathy, sympathy.

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:51.560 align:middle line:84%
But in real terms, it
doesn't do you very much good

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:55.470 align:middle line:84%
running somebody else's
emotions through your body.

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:58.280 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at
families, for example,

00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:02.240 align:middle line:84%
families are very much
in each other's space.

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And it causes challenges
in relationships,

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.730 align:middle line:84%
often, if you think about
it from that standpoint.

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Not beating up
families in any way.

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:14.330 align:middle line:84%
But I cannot distinguish
myself between your feelings

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:15.830 align:middle line:90%
and my feelings.

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Husbands, wives,
mothers, children.

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:20.360 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:24.720 align:middle line:84%
It's I like you because
you are like me.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:28.970 align:middle line:84%
But when I run your
you through the me,

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:31.750 align:middle line:90%
I get confused quite often.

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:33.710 align:middle line:84%
As soon you play
with this rose, you

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:37.760 align:middle line:84%
start to create a distinction
between your bubble that you

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.920 align:middle line:84%
live in and the
bubble that I live in.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And I can admire and respect
you a whole lot more many times

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:47.900 align:middle line:84%
when I'm not trying to figure
you out from right here.

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:50.294 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And feel everything
and process everything

00:42:50.294 --> 00:42:51.460 align:middle line:90%
the other person is feeling.

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And yet we do this
simply to feel like we're

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:55.360 align:middle line:90%
connected to each other.

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Very much.

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:59.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's a distortion.

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And once you begin
to create this--

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to use
the word separation,

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:07.360 align:middle line:84%
but identity of me
and identity of you,

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:11.620 align:middle line:84%
I can admire you far greater
in your creations rather than

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:14.430 align:middle line:84%
being in competition with you
because why did you get it

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:15.700 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't?

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:18.490 align:middle line:84%
So the whole mindset
begins to shift,

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and you literally start
to move into that place

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:25.270 align:middle line:84%
where I can allow you, admire
you, appreciate you being you,

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:28.700 align:middle line:84%
and learn opportunities
because I'm not in competition

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:29.500 align:middle line:90%
with you.

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:30.970 align:middle line:90%
Very beautifully stated.

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:31.886 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Very big deal.

00:43:31.886 --> 00:43:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Big deal.

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:36.250 align:middle line:84%
I can feel what you're
articulating energetically,

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:39.340 align:middle line:84%
as other people can listening to
this, watching this right now.

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.122 align:middle line:90%
That was very beautifully put.

00:43:41.122 --> 00:43:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: I'll give you
another simple one.

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:46.620 align:middle line:84%
See, and people understand
this concept of grounding,

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:47.420 align:middle line:90%
grounding.

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.630 align:middle line:84%
That word's been floating
around for some time.

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And people have
energetically begun

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:55.120 align:middle line:84%
to understand that
if you imagine

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.680 align:middle line:84%
a line from the
tip of your spine

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.810 align:middle line:84%
to the center of the
earth, just like putting

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:03.520 align:middle line:84%
your hand under the water to get
rid of that electrical charge.

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.290 align:middle line:84%
But I said earlier,
thoughts are electrical,

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:08.440 align:middle line:90%
emotions are magnetic.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So that electrical line
will start to siphon off

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.580 align:middle line:90%
many of those thoughts.

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:14.680 align:middle line:84%
You know how you get
people's thoughts

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:15.790 align:middle line:90%
and they're bouncing around?

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The busyness, yeah.

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.198 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: And you just are
consumed all day long.

00:44:18.198 --> 00:44:21.370 align:middle line:84%
That simply is like a ping pong
ball that has no place to go.

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:24.160 align:middle line:84%
But when you ground and
you give the command

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:27.430 align:middle line:84%
to turn on the grounding,
that electrical static

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:28.870 align:middle line:90%
has a place to go.

00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:33.310 align:middle line:84%
But simultaneously, the
emotions you feel many times

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:35.130 align:middle line:90%
are not your emotions.

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And so if you build a
little coil around that line

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:41.590 align:middle line:84%
that you connect, you
begin to neutralize

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:46.120 align:middle line:84%
many of the emotions that have
nothing to do with you at all.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:48.064 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Now think about it.

00:44:48.064 --> 00:44:50.380 align:middle line:84%
If you could get rid of
that anger or that sadness

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:53.560 align:middle line:84%
or that depression, what you
will find when you define

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:57.520 align:middle line:84%
the rose and you ground,
that a great portion of that

00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:00.970 align:middle line:84%
has nothing to do
with you at all.

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again,
very beautifully put.

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And now we go to this kind
of final little point,

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.520 align:middle line:84%
and a huge point, is that when
you're with you, when you're

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:11.560 align:middle line:84%
truly connected
with your deepest

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:17.520 align:middle line:84%
aspect of your multi-dimensional
self, there is this quietude.

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.890 align:middle line:84%
There's not a need for
chatter, for competition,

00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:23.020 align:middle line:90%
even to seek or question.

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:26.570 align:middle line:90%
It's so quiet and clear.

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And the contrast is
almost non-existent.

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:35.410 align:middle line:84%
We, up until now, feel
alive through contrast.

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:37.570 align:middle line:84%
So psychologically,
we have to let

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:40.570 align:middle line:84%
go of this desire
for this contrast

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:45.490 align:middle line:84%
to feel alive to go into
this much more sublime place.

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And how do you experience it,
your students, as you yourself,

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:51.520 align:middle line:84%
and the people that come
to your lectures and such,

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:55.510 align:middle line:90%
how does that progression look?

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Well, one
of the things that I

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:01.570 align:middle line:84%
find in kind of
this path that I've

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:04.920 align:middle line:84%
been asked to teach
by the archangels,

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.850 align:middle line:84%
and what the
archangels said is, we

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:09.730 align:middle line:84%
believe there's a pathway
that has never been walked,

00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:10.840 align:middle line:90%
never walked.

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And if it's followed,
it will ascend,

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:17.020 align:middle line:84%
it'll create an ascension
for those that walk it,

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:19.250 align:middle line:90%
a change, a dramatic change.

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:23.560 align:middle line:84%
But it will also create a
light, a magnetic portal,

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:27.100 align:middle line:84%
if you would, that will draw
all of the third dimension

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:29.000 align:middle line:90%
into the fifth dimension.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And so that's kind of
what mastering alchemy is.

00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:35.320 align:middle line:84%
But that pathway is very
specifically laid out.

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And words become very
important in the pathway.

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So if I say to you, in third
dimension, the word ease, like,

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.600 align:middle line:84%
oh, take it easy, you
have a sense of that.

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.280 align:middle line:84%
But when you get
into the quietness

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:50.830 align:middle line:84%
that you're pointing
to and you say,

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:56.840 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to experience ease,
very different experience

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.290 align:middle line:90%
energetically in the body.

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:02.230 align:middle line:84%
When you step into a
fifth dimensional space

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:05.980 align:middle line:84%
and you recognize that you are a
citizen of the fifth dimension,

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:11.470 align:middle line:84%
and in that space you live in
a reverence and a regalness,

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:14.740 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like a royalty with
the most wonderful side of it

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:19.360 align:middle line:84%
where this is who I am, that
presence becomes very big.

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Then you begin to experience
words like freedom in a way you

00:47:23.350 --> 00:47:26.380 align:middle line:84%
cannot imagine in a third
and fourth dimension.

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:28.990 align:middle line:84%
But you experience
that word ease.

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:35.350 align:middle line:84%
It's full, it's distinct,
it adds magnetics,

00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:38.680 align:middle line:84%
it attracts words
like graciousness.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And graciousness is a
fifth dimensional word.

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.750 align:middle line:84%
We can speak it in
our language, but you

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:47.140 align:middle line:84%
have no idea what
graciousness is

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:50.200 align:middle line:84%
as you begin to be that
citizen in the fifth dimension

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.450 align:middle line:84%
living in ease and
beauty and well-being.

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you've painted
a beautiful portrait of what

00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:58.590 align:middle line:90%
we can choose to move into.

00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:00.279 align:middle line:90%
And it is our choice.

00:48:00.279 --> 00:48:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: And where
we are about to go.

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And where
we're about to go.

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:07.067 align:middle line:84%
And again, mastering
alchemy is the work

00:48:07.067 --> 00:48:08.900 align:middle line:84%
that you're offering
the world at this time.

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:12.050 align:middle line:84%
People can check in with
you or go to seminars,

00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:13.090 align:middle line:90%
read books, whatnot.

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:17.430 align:middle line:84%
There's plenty online free
also, DVDs, all of the above,

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:20.720 align:middle line:84%
so they can start working
themselves through clearing--

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:24.740 align:middle line:84%
not just clearing, but actually
choosing to go on this path

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:27.130 align:middle line:84%
into themselves, into their
fifth dimensional self.

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:28.060 align:middle line:90%
It's very beautiful.

00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: It's a pathway.

00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:32.090 align:middle line:90%
It's not a truth.

00:48:32.090 --> 00:48:33.600 align:middle line:90%
It's not a philosophy.

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not anything.

00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:37.580 align:middle line:84%
It simply says, if you
can begin to change

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:43.460 align:middle line:84%
this I'm not OK into a sense
of I'm capable, I'm certain,

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:47.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm present, you have a
very different experience.

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:49.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not follow me or listen to.

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:52.010 align:middle line:90%
It's do this.

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Apply these tools and watch
the world around you change.

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think you're
a good person to do this.

00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:00.300 align:middle line:84%
You have a great deal
of humility and clarity

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:01.100 align:middle line:90%
in your being.

00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And I really appreciate
your taking the time

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:04.400 align:middle line:90%
to sit with me today.

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Thank you.

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.406 align:middle line:90%


00:49:07.406 --> 00:49:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I found the
details about the dissolution

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:11.240 align:middle line:84%
of the third
dimension, and our move

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:13.850 align:middle line:84%
into the thought form
world of the fourth,

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:15.429 align:middle line:90%
absolutely fascinating.

00:49:15.429 --> 00:49:16.970 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard that
we need to watch

00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:18.290 align:middle line:90%
the quality of our thoughts.

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:19.790 align:middle line:90%
