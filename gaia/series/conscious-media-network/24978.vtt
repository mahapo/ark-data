00:00:00.865 --> 00:00:03.212
<v ->Richard Moss is a visionary thinker,</v>

2
00:00:03.212 --> 00:00:04.812
a teacher, and an author

3
00:00:04.812 --> 00:00:07.649
on transformation and the art of conscious living.

4
00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:08.907
More than 30 years ago,

5
00:00:08.907 --> 00:00:10.689
he left the practice of medicine,

6
00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:12.683
after a life-changing realization

7
00:00:12.683 --> 00:00:14.038
that he needed to help others

8
00:00:14.038 --> 00:00:16.779
realize their multi-dimensional nature.

9
00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:18.656
This, he says, is the key to letting go

10
00:00:18.656 --> 00:00:21.419
of our burden of negativity and suffering.

11
00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:23.925
People aound the world have benefitted from his work,

12
00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:25.546
where they learn holistically,

13
00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:27.989
with their mind, body, and feelings.

14
00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:29.642
Most of us, however, tend to live

15
00:00:29.642 --> 00:00:31.914
split between two worlds of mind,

16
00:00:31.914 --> 00:00:33.865
neither aware of the other.

17
00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:40.235 line:15% 
(soothing music)

18
00:00:42.577 --> 00:00:45.376
We're going to start off with the T.S. Eliot poem.

19
00:00:45.376 --> 00:00:46.955
Could you please share that with us?

20
00:00:46.955 --> 00:00:48.213
It's very important.

21
00:00:48.213 --> 00:00:49.930
<v ->Yeah, in one of the four quartets,</v>

22
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.946
he says, "wait without hope,

23
00:00:51.946 --> 00:00:54.410
"for hope would be hope for the wrong thing,

24
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.647
"wait without love,

25
00:00:55.647 --> 00:00:58.058
"for love would be love of the wrong thing.

26
00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:00.842
"There is still hope and love and faith,

27
00:01:00.842 --> 00:01:02.868
"but the faith is in the waiting."

28
00:01:02.868 --> 00:01:05.204
Then he says, " wait without thought.

29
00:01:05.204 --> 00:01:07.881
"You are not ready for thought.

30
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:10.740
"And then the darkness shall become the light,

31
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.822
"and the stillness, the dancing."

32
00:01:14.722 --> 00:01:18.191
<v ->Well, I can see why you love this poem,</v>

33
00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:20.836
because you make this statement.

34
00:01:20.836 --> 00:01:23.161
"We have a mind, but we're not ready for it."

35
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:25.412
And these two must be linked.

36
00:01:25.412 --> 00:01:26.670
<v ->Yeah, they are.</v>

37
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.707
The notion of waiting, the notion of

38
00:01:28.707 --> 00:01:32.003
getting quiet enough to let,

39
00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:33.838
I use the expression mud,

40
00:01:33.838 --> 00:01:36.515
the mud of thoughts that disturb

41
00:01:36.515 --> 00:01:39.533
our sense of self, thoughts about ourselves,

42
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.315
that are judgments of ourselves,

43
00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:43.736
that make us inflated or depressed.

44
00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:45.314
Thoughts about the world, others,

45
00:01:45.314 --> 00:01:46.776
other people in particular

46
00:01:46.776 --> 00:01:48.962
that poison us in the moment.

47
00:01:48.962 --> 00:01:50.402
We have to wait.

48
00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:52.909
We have to wait, we have to let that get quiet

49
00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.202
because then, beneath that,

50
00:01:55.202 --> 00:01:57.783
is a much deeper layer of consciousness

51
00:01:57.783 --> 00:01:59.820
that is available to everybody.

52
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.081
It's not in service to our survival.

53
00:02:02.081 --> 00:02:03.980
It's not in service to our righteousness.

54
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.574
Our winning arguments, our winning battles.

55
00:02:09.044 --> 00:02:13.958
It's in service to being able to see ourselves as we are,

56
00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.784
and to know, to connect to,

57
00:02:16.784 --> 00:02:19.600
a much deeper level of wisdom within us.

58
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.341
An intuitive wisdom that's available to all of us,

59
00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:24.986
but which gets drowned out

60
00:02:24.986 --> 00:02:27.706
by the noise of thoughts that create guilt,

61
00:02:27.706 --> 00:02:30.095
and regret, and nostalgia.

62
00:02:30.095 --> 00:02:32.069
Thoughts about the future that frighten us

63
00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.437
or give us a false sense of hope.

64
00:02:36.057 --> 00:02:39.490
The mind, the ordinary mind, drowns out

65
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.437
this deeper process and the thought that we live

66
00:02:42.437 --> 00:02:44.528
from our ordinary mind

67
00:02:44.528 --> 00:02:46.522
is a thought that's purely about survival.

68
00:02:46.522 --> 00:02:49.498
It's not really different than a plant.

69
00:02:49.498 --> 00:02:51.589
A plant will turn to the light

70
00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:52.836
because it wants light.

71
00:02:52.836 --> 00:02:55.642
Any creature will turn to what nourishes it,

72
00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:57.246
and turn away from what threatens it.

73
00:02:57.246 --> 00:02:58.319
It will turn to pleasure,

74
00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.554
and try to avoid discomfort.

75
00:03:00.554 --> 00:03:04.757
And, ultimately, we have this enormous computer brain.

76
00:03:04.757 --> 00:03:09.172
All it's in service to is pleasure and avoiding pain.

77
00:03:09.172 --> 00:03:10.378
And that's not enough,

78
00:03:10.378 --> 00:03:11.562
because six and a half billion people

79
00:03:11.562 --> 00:03:14.441
pursuing their idea of fulfillment,

80
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:17.535
without any regard to connection

81
00:03:17.535 --> 00:03:20.910
to the planet as a whole,

82
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.638
is leading us now into ecologic disaster.

83
00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:26.686
Which is the opportunity of our time.

84
00:03:26.686 --> 00:03:29.289
We're basically seeing a failing

85
00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:30.803
of ordinary mind,

86
00:03:30.803 --> 00:03:32.190
We have to learn to wait.

87
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.568
I don't mean by wait, be passive and not act.

88
00:03:34.568 --> 00:03:36.702
I mean wait until we have reached

89
00:03:36.702 --> 00:03:39.720
a state of deep connectedness inside of us.

90
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.341
<v ->That's what you mean when you say,</v>

91
00:03:41.341 --> 00:03:43.389
"we have a mind, but we're not ready for it,"

92
00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.216
but, obviously, we need to be able to develop

93
00:03:46.216 --> 00:03:48.978
and access these other aspects of mind.

94
00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:50.909
And that's what your work is about.

95
00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.021
<v ->Yes, I mean, it's my work,</v>

96
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:56.316
it's been the work of the mystics and seers

97
00:03:56.316 --> 00:04:00.220
for millenia, but the work--

98
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.850
every generation is born undeveloped.

99
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:03.890
Every generation.

100
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.703
We're all babies, then children,

101
00:04:05.703 --> 00:04:07.958
and young adults.

102
00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.443
And, with the mind that we inherit,

103
00:04:10.443 --> 00:04:12.833
through our conditioning, through our families,

104
00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:15.275
through our culture, through our education,

105
00:04:15.275 --> 00:04:18.176
secular and religious education,

106
00:04:18.176 --> 00:04:21.077
is a very superficial level of mind.

107
00:04:21.077 --> 00:04:23.168
It's a mind driven by thought.

108
00:04:23.168 --> 00:04:24.725
And it's a computer.

109
00:04:24.725 --> 00:04:25.909
I mean, all you have to do

110
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:27.861
is have a thought that makes you important,

111
00:04:27.861 --> 00:04:29.674
and you puff up in self-importance.

112
00:04:29.674 --> 00:04:30.879
All you have to do is have a thought

113
00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:34.133
that makes you judgmental of someone else, or angry,

114
00:04:34.133 --> 00:04:36.266
and all the neurotransmitters

115
00:04:36.266 --> 00:04:38.122
are running around inside of you,

116
00:04:38.122 --> 00:04:40.788
and the cortisol, and your inner being

117
00:04:40.788 --> 00:04:43.508
is poisoned with anger and resentment

118
00:04:43.508 --> 00:04:45.268
and bitterness, these kinds of things.

119
00:04:45.268 --> 00:04:46.452
It's a computer.

120
00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:47.753
And it's a computer that can take you

121
00:04:47.753 --> 00:04:49.844
through Harvard, and MIT, and Cal Tech,

122
00:04:49.844 --> 00:04:51.722
and the Sur Vonne.

123
00:04:51.722 --> 00:04:53.843
Without you actually connected

124
00:04:53.843 --> 00:04:57.812
to this deeper-root mind,

125
00:04:57.812 --> 00:05:00.531
this deeper awareness, which isn't a "me and I,"

126
00:05:00.531 --> 00:05:01.715
it's not a Richard Moss,

127
00:05:01.715 --> 00:05:05.065
it's not the name any of us use for ourselves.

128
00:05:05.065 --> 00:05:06.110
It's not our religion.

129
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.656
It's not our nationality.

130
00:05:07.656 --> 00:05:10.099
In it, that, we have to wait.

131
00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:12.147
We have to let, we have to teach ourselves

132
00:05:12.147 --> 00:05:14.952
how to become available to that intelligence,

133
00:05:14.952 --> 00:05:16.371
And when we start to listen

134
00:05:16.371 --> 00:05:18.248
to that intelligence, we have to start

135
00:05:18.248 --> 00:05:21.405
risking the changes in our behavior

136
00:05:21.405 --> 00:05:23.314
that take our deeper consciousness

137
00:05:23.314 --> 00:05:25.715
and turn it into meaningful action.

138
00:05:25.715 --> 00:05:27.315
<v ->Because that may mean our life</v>

139
00:05:27.315 --> 00:05:28.872
and our circumstances shift around it.

140
00:05:28.872 --> 00:05:31.453
Once we start accessing greater truths

141
00:05:31.453 --> 00:05:33.096
within the greater mind.

142
00:05:33.096 --> 00:05:34.611
<v ->We have to change.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

143
00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:35.933
<v ->We see how--
<v Regina>And we're afraid of</v>

144
00:05:35.933 --> 00:05:37.512
letting go of what we, like you say,

145
00:05:37.512 --> 00:05:39.250
have already developed for our satisfaction

146
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.594
and our survival.

147
00:05:40.594 --> 00:05:42.717
You know, having our little nuts

148
00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:44.519
in our little basket.

149
00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:45.965
We don't want to let go.

150
00:05:45.965 --> 00:05:48.461
<v ->Take something as simple as divorce.</v>

151
00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:51.154
Two people didn't just come together

152
00:05:51.154 --> 00:05:52.828
because they were indifferent to each other.

153
00:05:52.828 --> 00:05:53.756
They cared.

154
00:05:53.756 --> 00:05:55.612
They may have been wildly in love.

155
00:05:55.612 --> 00:05:57.511
Nature wants us to be wildly in love,

156
00:05:57.511 --> 00:05:59.185
because wildly in love means

157
00:05:59.185 --> 00:06:02.300
lots of intercourse, which means babies.

158
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.244
But it's not a conscious process.

159
00:06:05.244 --> 00:06:08.849
Divorce, however, happens one thought at a time.

160
00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:09.841
And you won't get divorced

161
00:06:09.841 --> 00:06:11.003
after one thought.

162
00:06:11.003 --> 00:06:12.539
But after 100,000 thoughts,

163
00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.534
"he doesn't listen to me,"

164
00:06:14.534 --> 00:06:16.507
"he's too busy with his work,"

165
00:06:16.507 --> 00:06:18.619
"he's looking at other people,"

166
00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:21.616
"she doesn't really care about what's important to me,"

167
00:06:21.616 --> 00:06:24.123
and on and on.

168
00:06:24.123 --> 00:06:25.328
One thought after another.

169
00:06:25.328 --> 00:06:26.981
And, in the moment of that thought,

170
00:06:26.981 --> 00:06:29.722
a body, mind polluted with unhappiness,

171
00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:32.858
anger, resentment, jealousy, envy.

172
00:06:32.858 --> 00:06:35.226
And that's so unconscious.

173
00:06:35.226 --> 00:06:36.666
We think that's a conscious life?

174
00:06:36.666 --> 00:06:39.119
It's a fast asleep life.

175
00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:41.465
So, if you start to just look at

176
00:06:41.465 --> 00:06:43.535
what you do in a relationship,

177
00:06:43.535 --> 00:06:45.902
you get to see the inability

178
00:06:45.902 --> 00:06:48.484
to let that deeper wisdom grow love

179
00:06:48.484 --> 00:06:50.713
in your world and in your life,

180
00:06:50.713 --> 00:06:53.806
and we keep believing the problem is the other person.

181
00:06:53.806 --> 00:06:55.171
We don't realize, the problem is

182
00:06:55.171 --> 00:06:57.726
the thought I have about the other person.

183
00:06:57.726 --> 00:07:00.846
We think the problem is how the other person is,

184
00:07:00.846 --> 00:07:03.982
but the problem is our judgment of the other person.

185
00:07:03.982 --> 00:07:08.323
Now, if I say to myself, "I am aware that I am judging you,

186
00:07:08.323 --> 00:07:11.203
"I'm aware that that is making me angry,

187
00:07:11.203 --> 00:07:12.643
"I wonder what would happen

188
00:07:12.643 --> 00:07:14.776
"if I got really, really quiet, deeply quiet,

189
00:07:14.776 --> 00:07:16.845
"if I wait without thought,

190
00:07:16.845 --> 00:07:18.029
"because I'm not ready for thought,

191
00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:19.746
"I wait without these judgments,

192
00:07:19.746 --> 00:07:21.954
"because these judgments are poisoning me,

193
00:07:21.954 --> 00:07:23.831
"and they poison people everywhere."

194
00:07:23.831 --> 00:07:25.250
Six and a half billion human beings,

195
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.642
I'm talking about what every human being does,

196
00:07:28.642 --> 00:07:30.775
except those that have awakened

197
00:07:30.775 --> 00:07:33.303
and worked very hard

198
00:07:33.303 --> 00:07:35.767
to stop listening to their thoughts.

199
00:07:35.767 --> 00:07:37.697
But, if you get quiet,

200
00:07:37.697 --> 00:07:39.596
if I get quiet with my wife,

201
00:07:39.596 --> 00:07:40.662
and I start to--

202
00:07:40.662 --> 00:07:43.339
and the mud of my anger, or my resentment,

203
00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:46.817
or my self-importance, self-righteousness settles,

204
00:07:46.817 --> 00:07:49.835
suddenly, I can all of the sudden see her,

205
00:07:49.835 --> 00:07:52.320
see her circumstances, see what she cares about,

206
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.347
see what she values.

207
00:07:54.347 --> 00:07:56.917
And then, quite spontaneously,

208
00:07:56.917 --> 00:07:59.264
love flowers again.

209
00:07:59.264 --> 00:08:02.496
But I have to wait without the love I remember.

210
00:08:02.496 --> 00:08:04.725
I have to wait without hope that she's going to change,

211
00:08:04.725 --> 00:08:06.975
which is the utter, ultimate arrogance,

212
00:08:06.975 --> 00:08:08.277
the world should change

213
00:08:08.277 --> 00:08:10.431
to make me feel better.

214
00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:11.658
She should change.

215
00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:14.281
He should change, so that I feel good.

216
00:08:14.281 --> 00:08:15.796
The government should change.

217
00:08:15.796 --> 00:08:17.769
Oh, by the way, everybody should start

218
00:08:17.769 --> 00:08:20.233
being very ecological so that I feel better.

219
00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:23.646
It's arrogance.

220
00:08:23.646 --> 00:08:26.985
<v ->And yet, as you say, 6 billion plus people</v>

221
00:08:26.985 --> 00:08:29.406
engage in this every day.

222
00:08:29.406 --> 00:08:31.838
And it's for some, for most,

223
00:08:31.838 --> 00:08:33.566
maybe every moment of every day.

224
00:08:33.566 --> 00:08:35.721
<v ->And it's what we call being human.</v>

225
00:08:35.721 --> 00:08:39.112
And, if that's all that we are as a human being,

226
00:08:39.112 --> 00:08:40.894
then we are doomed.

227
00:08:40.894 --> 00:08:42.312
We're simply doomed.

228
00:08:42.312 --> 00:08:44.499
We are an incredibly intelligent

229
00:08:44.499 --> 00:08:47.635
computer machine that will find some way

230
00:08:47.635 --> 00:08:49.394
to make pleasure for itself,

231
00:08:49.394 --> 00:08:51.112
even at the expense of others,

232
00:08:51.112 --> 00:08:53.298
even at the expense of the air,

233
00:08:53.298 --> 00:08:54.781
even at the expense of the water,

234
00:08:54.781 --> 00:08:58.214
and the oceans, and the food quality.

235
00:08:58.214 --> 00:09:00.478
But, that's not all who you are.

236
00:09:00.478 --> 00:09:03.518
We also have, what people would call,

237
00:09:03.518 --> 00:09:05.352
the holy soul, or the deeper self,

238
00:09:05.352 --> 00:09:06.654
or the higher self.

239
00:09:06.654 --> 00:09:08.883
But, in the most simple sense,

240
00:09:08.883 --> 00:09:11.763
it's what's there in any person who gets quiet.

241
00:09:11.763 --> 00:09:13.832
And now we have children

242
00:09:13.832 --> 00:09:15.922
who don't feel safe in nature.

243
00:09:15.922 --> 00:09:16.818
That have to have

244
00:09:16.818 --> 00:09:21.138
the toys going fast, the media coming at them loud,

245
00:09:21.138 --> 00:09:24.626
the boom box belting out sound.

246
00:09:24.626 --> 00:09:27.314
We know that we're literally

247
00:09:27.314 --> 00:09:29.938
seeing that children are losing the ability.

248
00:09:29.938 --> 00:09:32.892
16 year olds have been losing it 1% a year

249
00:09:32.892 --> 00:09:35.239
since they first started studying this in Germany,

250
00:09:35.239 --> 00:09:37.158
and then in the U.S. in the late 70s and 80s.

251
00:09:37.158 --> 00:09:40.209
We're losing the ability to differentiate color.

252
00:09:41.809 --> 00:09:44.097
We're becoming more unconscious.

253
00:09:44.097 --> 00:09:47.212
We're becoming more dull.
<v Regina>Computers, yes.</v>

254
00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:49.302
<v ->Yes, but we're only processing information</v>

255
00:09:49.302 --> 00:09:51.393
of immediate intensity,

256
00:09:51.393 --> 00:09:53.675
without a sense of belonging or connection

257
00:09:53.675 --> 00:09:55.883
to something more.

258
00:09:55.883 --> 00:09:57.643
But that connection is there.

259
00:09:57.643 --> 00:09:59.104
It's always there.

260
00:09:59.104 --> 00:10:01.195
When a person suddenly has a shock,

261
00:10:01.195 --> 00:10:03.424
like, a death, and everything stops.

262
00:10:03.424 --> 00:10:04.704
Or they get notification

263
00:10:04.704 --> 00:10:08.138
that they have a serious, perhaps, terminal illness.

264
00:10:08.138 --> 00:10:10.229
Then, for people, there's an opportunity

265
00:10:10.229 --> 00:10:11.295
for everything to stop.

266
00:10:11.295 --> 00:10:14.922
And when all that rushing and busyness

267
00:10:14.922 --> 00:10:17.492
and pursuing happiness

268
00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:20.681
in a very superficial sense,

269
00:10:20.681 --> 00:10:22.537
when all of that stops, suddenly,

270
00:10:22.537 --> 00:10:24.969
wow, yes, maybe my body's dying

271
00:10:24.969 --> 00:10:26.654
and I've just learned about it,

272
00:10:26.654 --> 00:10:28.233
but what is this sense of peace

273
00:10:28.233 --> 00:10:30.068
that's welling up inside of me?

274
00:10:30.068 --> 00:10:31.689
Why do we have to wait for the crisis

275
00:10:31.689 --> 00:10:34.174
to know the real bounty of life?

276
00:10:34.174 --> 00:10:36.126
That's what I go around the world saying.

277
00:10:36.126 --> 00:10:38.003
Don't wait for that.

278
00:10:38.003 --> 00:10:43.003
But, it took almost no energy to create a mind

279
00:10:43.027 --> 00:10:45.597
that thinks in terms of past, future,

280
00:10:45.597 --> 00:10:48.018
me, my importance, my special-ness,

281
00:10:48.018 --> 00:10:50.034
and you, who you are, who you aren't,

282
00:10:50.034 --> 00:10:51.101
and how I judge you

283
00:10:51.101 --> 00:10:52.871
that makes me angry or makes me hurt.

284
00:10:52.871 --> 00:10:54.024
It took nothing.

285
00:10:55.064 --> 00:10:58.162
By the time you're six years old, it's in place.

286
00:10:58.162 --> 00:10:59.858
By the time you're 15 years old,

287
00:10:59.858 --> 00:11:02.685
it's really, really got you, you know?

288
00:11:02.685 --> 00:11:04.989
And the only training you did

289
00:11:04.989 --> 00:11:06.546
was not a significant training.

290
00:11:06.546 --> 00:11:08.210
I happened to have graduated medical school,

291
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.514
and I can tell you, it's easy.

292
00:11:10.514 --> 00:11:12.188
Just a basic level of intelligence

293
00:11:12.188 --> 00:11:14.503
and a certain amount of hours.

294
00:11:14.503 --> 00:11:15.825
Now, there are some very bright people

295
00:11:15.825 --> 00:11:17.660
who will get to the top level schools,

296
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:22.033
but it's still just simply training a computer.

297
00:11:22.033 --> 00:11:24.092
You haven't necessarily--
<v Regina>Programming it.</v>

298
00:11:24.092 --> 00:11:26.747
<v ->Yep, you haven't taught the person how to truly think</v>

299
00:11:26.747 --> 00:11:29.808
rooted in a deeper connection.

300
00:11:29.808 --> 00:11:32.038
So when you start to wake up,

301
00:11:32.038 --> 00:11:33.104
when you have an awakening

302
00:11:33.104 --> 00:11:34.960
to your essential self,

303
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.776
which is an experience that can be both,

304
00:11:37.776 --> 00:11:39.611
it can be very easy, in a sense of

305
00:11:39.611 --> 00:11:44.368
a gloriously rich, deep, profound, mystical connection.

306
00:11:44.368 --> 00:11:47.173
Joy, bliss, peace that passeth understanding.

307
00:11:47.173 --> 00:11:49.594
This also can be a very rough ride,

308
00:11:49.594 --> 00:11:51.375
and I've written about this in my books,

309
00:11:51.375 --> 00:11:53.508
how rough a ride this awakening

310
00:11:53.508 --> 00:11:55.492
to this deeper consciousness can be.

311
00:11:55.492 --> 00:12:00.015
But, the actual allowing

312
00:12:00.015 --> 00:12:01.849
of your life to change.

313
00:12:01.849 --> 00:12:04.612
The discipline to start living in the now,

314
00:12:04.612 --> 00:12:06.094
in the present moment,

315
00:12:06.094 --> 00:12:07.470
with a deeper awareness,

316
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.283
and returning to that connection,

317
00:12:09.283 --> 00:12:12.046
is as hard work, or more difficult work,

318
00:12:12.046 --> 00:12:13.987
than becoming a neurosurgeon.

319
00:12:13.987 --> 00:12:15.715
Or, you know, people will say to me,

320
00:12:15.715 --> 00:12:17.176
"well, what's the shortcut for peace?"

321
00:12:17.176 --> 00:12:20.333
and I'll say, "would you ask Lance Armstrong

322
00:12:20.333 --> 00:12:22.978
"for a shortcut to winning the Tour de France?"

323
00:12:22.978 --> 00:12:23.693
<v ->Right.</v>

324
00:12:23.693 --> 00:12:25.858
<v ->The shortcut is, work.</v>

325
00:12:25.858 --> 00:12:27.949
And we don't know it in our culture.

326
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:32.949
We are an incredibly, incredibly indulgent, lazy society.

327
00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:34.284
We want other--

328
00:12:34.284 --> 00:12:36.236
you know, it is difficult to make decisions.

329
00:12:36.236 --> 00:12:38.647
They're beginning to do research

330
00:12:38.647 --> 00:12:40.577
on how actually difficult it is

331
00:12:40.577 --> 00:12:41.687
to make decisions.

332
00:12:41.687 --> 00:12:43.777
So, people make the same decision

333
00:12:43.777 --> 00:12:46.294
over and over again, even if it's bad.

334
00:12:46.294 --> 00:12:48.662
Even if it was good the first time.

335
00:12:48.662 --> 00:12:50.817
The decision to withdraw as a child

336
00:12:50.817 --> 00:12:52.491
may have been a good defense.

337
00:12:52.491 --> 00:12:54.369
The decision to withdraw as an adult

338
00:12:54.369 --> 00:12:56.502
is not a good decision.

339
00:12:56.502 --> 00:12:58.315
The decision to rebel as a child

340
00:12:58.315 --> 00:13:00.150
may have saved you and your family,

341
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.496
but the decision to continue being a rebel,

342
00:13:02.496 --> 00:13:04.651
or becoming a grandiose know-it-all,

343
00:13:04.651 --> 00:13:08.042
which is an adult's version of that, often,

344
00:13:08.042 --> 00:13:10.037
is not a good decision.

345
00:13:10.037 --> 00:13:12.437
So, we make the same decisions over and over again,

346
00:13:12.437 --> 00:13:14.847
and because decisions are so difficult,

347
00:13:14.847 --> 00:13:18.143
we let other people make decisions for us.

348
00:13:18.143 --> 00:13:19.583
So, we're part of a business

349
00:13:19.583 --> 00:13:24.116
that will create weapons that are heinous.

350
00:13:24.116 --> 00:13:25.225
We're a part of a business

351
00:13:25.225 --> 00:13:28.681
that sells foods loaded with trans fats.

352
00:13:28.681 --> 00:13:30.942
And we, ourselves, may stop eating trans fats,

353
00:13:30.942 --> 00:13:32.329
but we go to work at the same place

354
00:13:32.329 --> 00:13:33.865
because it pays our bills.

355
00:13:33.865 --> 00:13:36.254
We want politicians to make choices for us.

356
00:13:36.254 --> 00:13:37.203
<v ->Isn't this an example of what happens</v>

357
00:13:37.203 --> 00:13:38.973
when you have a brain that's

358
00:13:38.973 --> 00:13:41.523
smart enough to go to MIT and carry out

359
00:13:41.523 --> 00:13:44.660
whatever its program is, but without the wisdom

360
00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.164
of the mind you're talking about.

361
00:13:46.164 --> 00:13:47.956
<v ->Without the wisdom of a deeper mind,</v>

362
00:13:47.956 --> 00:13:49.459
that deeper awareness.

363
00:13:49.459 --> 00:13:54.459
Yes, to me, it's the (stammers) cosmic joke.

364
00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:56.654
How could we be so smart

365
00:13:56.654 --> 00:13:57.774
and be so stupid?

366
00:13:57.774 --> 00:14:00.163
How smart are people like Alan Greenspan,

367
00:14:00.163 --> 00:14:05.163
that could allow such economic stupidity to happen?

368
00:14:05.272 --> 00:14:07.362
How smart are these people that run

369
00:14:07.362 --> 00:14:11.490
these multibillion dollar financial--

370
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.218
Bear Stearns just collapsed, right?

371
00:14:13.218 --> 00:14:13.837
<v ->Right.</v>

372
00:14:13.837 --> 00:14:15.650
<v ->I mean, these people are supposedly smart,</v>

373
00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:16.994
the brightest of the bright.

374
00:14:16.994 --> 00:14:18.530
You want to know how bright they are?

375
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.108
They are the brightest of the bright,

376
00:14:20.108 --> 00:14:22.775
but they're like a horse with blinkers on.

377
00:14:22.775 --> 00:14:24.641
They're walking along like this,

378
00:14:24.641 --> 00:14:26.262
and they're super bright,

379
00:14:26.262 --> 00:14:29.260
but they're looking at one- one millionth of the picture.

380
00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:33.547
It's the notion of, they have the focus of an eagle,

381
00:14:33.547 --> 00:14:34.945
but they don't have the spacious,

382
00:14:34.945 --> 00:14:37.824
vast, view of the terrain that the eagle has.

383
00:14:39.534 --> 00:14:41.916
They think of themselves as eagles,

384
00:14:41.916 --> 00:14:43.558
soaring above the society,

385
00:14:43.558 --> 00:14:45.862
worth millions a year for their intelligence,

386
00:14:45.862 --> 00:14:47.718
and they don't have a view of the world

387
00:14:47.718 --> 00:14:50.854
in its integrity, a view of connectedness,

388
00:14:50.854 --> 00:14:53.894
a view of belonging, because they wouldn't choose

389
00:14:53.894 --> 00:14:55.493
to act the way they do

390
00:14:55.493 --> 00:14:57.445
in service to their own organizations

391
00:14:57.445 --> 00:14:59.600
if they had a spacious mind.

392
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.394
They have a focused mind, a trained mind.

393
00:15:02.394 --> 00:15:03.781
A narrow mind.

394
00:15:03.781 --> 00:15:05.040
And they're rewarded for it!

395
00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.170
They get wealthy.

396
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:07.546
They have the best of the best.

397
00:15:07.546 --> 00:15:09.167
<v ->They can stay on task.</v>

398
00:15:09.167 --> 00:15:12.046
<v ->And some of them are wonderful people.</v>

399
00:15:12.046 --> 00:15:17.046
You can be successful and have a spiritual awareness,

400
00:15:17.745 --> 00:15:19.537
but most of them don't have

401
00:15:19.537 --> 00:15:20.817
a deep spiritual awareness.

402
00:15:20.817 --> 00:15:23.739
What they have is a kind of religious,

403
00:15:23.739 --> 00:15:26.086
and it's almost a contradiction in their lives,

404
00:15:26.086 --> 00:15:27.387
they're religious over here,

405
00:15:27.387 --> 00:15:30.182
and then they're ruthlessly focused over here,

406
00:15:30.182 --> 00:15:31.936
and the two worlds don't meet.

407
00:15:31.936 --> 00:15:34.677
Because, religion itself, is, again, training,

408
00:15:34.677 --> 00:15:39.413
as opposed to true, deep intelligence.

409
00:15:39.413 --> 00:15:40.789
<v ->And what kind of damage does that do?</v>

410
00:15:40.789 --> 00:15:42.058
To have that kind of split

411
00:15:42.058 --> 00:15:43.391
in one's own psyche?

412
00:15:43.391 --> 00:15:46.196
Show up for church or synagogue on the weekends

413
00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:48.639
and then you go into a ruthless

414
00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:51.583
or materialistic endeavor all week long

415
00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:54.025
and focus all of your intention and energy there?

416
00:15:54.025 --> 00:15:55.881
What does that do to our mind?

417
00:15:57.411 --> 00:16:00.798
<v ->I think that's a form of safety, believe it or not.</v>

418
00:16:00.798 --> 00:16:03.657
I compartmentalize myself so that I can say

419
00:16:03.657 --> 00:16:06.025
I'm special, because I'm a good Christian,

420
00:16:06.025 --> 00:16:07.881
or I'm a good Jew, or I'm a good Muslim,

421
00:16:07.881 --> 00:16:09.395
and look, I do my worship.

422
00:16:09.395 --> 00:16:11.486
And then I (whistles) step out of that compartment,

423
00:16:11.486 --> 00:16:13.246
step into a different sub-personality

424
00:16:13.246 --> 00:16:15.336
that's the business person, or the entrepreneur,

425
00:16:15.336 --> 00:16:18.813
or the research scientist, or the investment banker.

426
00:16:18.813 --> 00:16:23.352
And, I think, we just,when we can put ourselves

427
00:16:23.352 --> 00:16:26.179
into these different identities,

428
00:16:26.179 --> 00:16:28.323
without actually having a deeper consciousness

429
00:16:28.323 --> 00:16:29.688
that takes a look at all of them,

430
00:16:29.688 --> 00:16:31.917
and takes a look and says,

431
00:16:31.917 --> 00:16:33.197
"hey, wait a minute,

432
00:16:33.197 --> 00:16:37.534
"if this is true here, then what are you doing that there?"

433
00:16:38.334 --> 00:16:40.942
I think we do that, we compartmentalize like that,

434
00:16:40.942 --> 00:16:42.318
<v ->For safety.
<v Richard>For safety.</v>

435
00:16:42.318 --> 00:16:44.355
Just emotional, psychological safety.

436
00:16:44.355 --> 00:16:46.008
And laziness.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

437
00:16:46.008 --> 00:16:49.144
<v ->Maybe no one was there with the wisdom</v>

438
00:16:49.144 --> 00:16:53.040
to challenge us to go beyond that way of being.

439
00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:53.965
<v ->Right.</v>

440
00:16:53.965 --> 00:16:56.202
So let's talk about what happens if you

441
00:16:56.202 --> 00:16:59.643
are conscious enough, in your own right,

442
00:16:59.643 --> 00:17:00.944
that you are going to now

443
00:17:00.944 --> 00:17:03.254
raise a child in a conscious manner?

444
00:17:03.254 --> 00:17:05.803
Tell us what that experience would be like,

445
00:17:05.803 --> 00:17:07.126
as parent and child,

446
00:17:07.126 --> 00:17:08.310
so we can have a model

447
00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.027
for how we begin fostering this.

448
00:17:10.027 --> 00:17:13.413
Because, we as a species have wandered so far away from it.

449
00:17:14.976 --> 00:17:16.431
<v ->Wow.</v>

450
00:17:16.432 --> 00:17:18.106
Well, you come right to the heart

451
00:17:18.106 --> 00:17:20.059
of what, I know my wife and I talk about

452
00:17:20.059 --> 00:17:22.288
all the time, and it's so important to her.

453
00:17:22.288 --> 00:17:23.941
But, I don't think that we can tell anyone

454
00:17:23.941 --> 00:17:25.541
how to raise their child.

455
00:17:25.541 --> 00:17:27.731
I think what we have to say is,

456
00:17:27.731 --> 00:17:30.555
if you had a sense of connection

457
00:17:30.555 --> 00:17:33.200
to the world in a deeper sense,

458
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.152
a connection to yourself in a deeper sense,

459
00:17:35.152 --> 00:17:39.514
so that you weren't being chased by so many fears,

460
00:17:39.514 --> 00:17:41.050
I don't think you would communicate

461
00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.525
the same kind of fears to your children.

462
00:17:43.525 --> 00:17:46.224
Why do people ask Kindergartners

463
00:17:46.224 --> 00:17:49.285
to start learning things that they're not ready to learn?

464
00:17:49.285 --> 00:17:50.821
Why do we send these children

465
00:17:50.821 --> 00:17:52.954
to special schools to get a head start

466
00:17:52.954 --> 00:17:54.650
on getting them into the most--

467
00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.250
you know, this is the wealthy--

468
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.138
into the best private schools.

469
00:17:58.138 --> 00:18:00.384
The answer has to be fear.

470
00:18:01.434 --> 00:18:03.130
But it hides as a sense,

471
00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:05.466
"this will give my children the best opportunity

472
00:18:05.466 --> 00:18:08.641
"to succeed in the future, and success will mean

473
00:18:08.641 --> 00:18:10.586
"their genes will be passed on,

474
00:18:10.586 --> 00:18:12.783
"and my genes will be passed on.

475
00:18:12.783 --> 00:18:15.045
"Success will mean that I can feel good about myself

476
00:18:15.045 --> 00:18:16.943
"because I'm not worried about them."

477
00:18:16.943 --> 00:18:20.122
It's an incredibly narcissistic choice.

478
00:18:20.122 --> 00:18:25.028
I think that the true spiritual development

479
00:18:25.028 --> 00:18:27.940
of a man or a woman who's going to be a parent

480
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.891
is a hard work,

481
00:18:30.891 --> 00:18:32.256
and that no one can then say,

482
00:18:32.256 --> 00:18:34.624
"here's the formula for being a good parent."

483
00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:37.366
We see that people that really

484
00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:39.787
have indulged their children in the last,

485
00:18:39.787 --> 00:18:41.387
kind of, baby boom years,

486
00:18:41.387 --> 00:18:43.243
have actually weakened them.

487
00:18:43.243 --> 00:18:44.330
We see that the clean,

488
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.282
physically clean environments,

489
00:18:46.282 --> 00:18:48.490
where children aren't crawling around in the dirt,

490
00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:49.951
have actually caused them to have

491
00:18:49.951 --> 00:18:51.530
weak immune systems.

492
00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:55.124
We see that kids that weren't struggling

493
00:18:55.124 --> 00:18:59.028
in school with conflicting levels

494
00:18:59.028 --> 00:19:03.561
of social socioeconomic levels right in the schools,

495
00:19:03.561 --> 00:19:05.929
and multicultural stuff, and friction,

496
00:19:05.929 --> 00:19:09.188
have trouble being able to deal with conflict

497
00:19:09.188 --> 00:19:11.449
when they grow up.

498
00:19:14.669 --> 00:19:16.833
We don't know the right path,

499
00:19:16.833 --> 00:19:19.083
but what I believe to be true,

500
00:19:19.083 --> 00:19:20.128
and what I've tried to live

501
00:19:20.128 --> 00:19:23.211
with my own step-children for more than 20 years.

502
00:19:23.211 --> 00:19:25.163
They are now adults, but they were young

503
00:19:25.163 --> 00:19:26.677
when we started.

504
00:19:26.677 --> 00:19:28.365
And, what my wife has tried to live

505
00:19:28.365 --> 00:19:31.445
with her children has been, our journey,

506
00:19:31.445 --> 00:19:33.803
as unfolding and evolving human beings,

507
00:19:33.803 --> 00:19:38.208
not ideologies about what is the best way to raise a kid.

508
00:19:38.208 --> 00:19:41.141
But, the more authentic I am,

509
00:19:41.141 --> 00:19:44.533
the more I'm going to respond to my child authentically.

510
00:19:44.533 --> 00:19:46.111
The more authentic I am,

511
00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:48.991
the more I'm going to perceive her, or his,

512
00:19:48.991 --> 00:19:51.540
authenticity, and respond to it.

513
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.556
The more I am a product of a story

514
00:19:53.556 --> 00:19:54.911
I tell myself in my head,

515
00:19:54.911 --> 00:19:56.852
about the kind of man or woman I should be,

516
00:19:56.852 --> 00:19:58.409
the more I'm going to look to see

517
00:19:58.409 --> 00:19:59.647
if my children are becoming

518
00:19:59.647 --> 00:20:02.196
the man or woman I think they should be.

519
00:20:02.196 --> 00:20:05.257
Unconsciousness begets unconsciousness.

520
00:20:05.257 --> 00:20:08.979
<v ->Yes, and you, in particular,</v>

521
00:20:08.979 --> 00:20:12.584
appreciate a lot of the Eastern traditions

522
00:20:12.584 --> 00:20:14.441
and what they have to offer

523
00:20:14.441 --> 00:20:18.014
as a means to finding ourselves,

524
00:20:18.014 --> 00:20:20.083
as a means to jumping on this path

525
00:20:20.083 --> 00:20:22.195
of unfolding the mind properly.

526
00:20:22.195 --> 00:20:24.894
Can you get into that a little bit?

527
00:20:24.894 --> 00:20:26.515
<v ->Yeah, well I was a physician.</v>

528
00:20:26.515 --> 00:20:27.240
<v ->Yes.</v>

529
00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.627
<v ->I don't practice medicine any more,</v>

530
00:20:28.627 --> 00:20:30.301
but when you're a physician,

531
00:20:30.301 --> 00:20:32.552
yes, of course, you diagnose an illness,

532
00:20:32.552 --> 00:20:35.197
but, there would be no satisfaction in that

533
00:20:35.197 --> 00:20:36.754
unless there was a treatment.

534
00:20:36.754 --> 00:20:38.823
Now, unfortunately, there's only limited treatments.

535
00:20:38.823 --> 00:20:40.818
But there are, I mean, the mechanistic problems,

536
00:20:40.818 --> 00:20:43.005
like a broken bone, we can do great things with.

537
00:20:43.005 --> 00:20:45.906
Or a laceration.
<v Regina>Trauma.</v>

538
00:20:45.906 --> 00:20:49.617
<v ->Yes, trauma, we've developed, through the military,</v>

539
00:20:49.617 --> 00:20:51.153
ways of dealing with trauma.

540
00:20:51.153 --> 00:20:53.820
But the notion of,

541
00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.070
the reason I appreciate so much

542
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.190
the Eastern philosophies,

543
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:59.004
is that they're incredibly pragmatic.

544
00:20:59.004 --> 00:21:01.201
You don't just learn the Buddhist teaching,

545
00:21:01.201 --> 00:21:03.899
you have to sit there and practice meditation.

546
00:21:03.899 --> 00:21:06.054
You have to learn to wait, without hope,

547
00:21:06.054 --> 00:21:07.750
and without love, and without faith,

548
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.008
and without thought.

549
00:21:09.008 --> 00:21:11.184
That is, literally, what the contemplative,

550
00:21:11.184 --> 00:21:13.189
meditative path is about.

551
00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:15.333
You can read all the Western philosophers.

552
00:21:15.333 --> 00:21:16.496
I can't say I've read them all,

553
00:21:16.496 --> 00:21:18.448
but I've read a good chunk of them.

554
00:21:18.448 --> 00:21:20.485
There's almost nothing in any of them,

555
00:21:20.485 --> 00:21:24.058
other than the example they may set for us,

556
00:21:24.058 --> 00:21:27.151
and there were lives like Emmanuel Comte,

557
00:21:27.151 --> 00:21:29.242
who, they were really fascinating lives,

558
00:21:29.242 --> 00:21:31.450
and his ethics, his values, his morality

559
00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:34.628
is as finely a stated morality as any in the world,

560
00:21:34.628 --> 00:21:36.207
and I believe he tried to live that.

561
00:21:36.207 --> 00:21:39.493
But the Eastern philosophies, intrinsically,

562
00:21:39.493 --> 00:21:41.018
are methodologies.

563
00:21:41.018 --> 00:21:44.058
Methodologies for realizing and experiencing

564
00:21:44.058 --> 00:21:46.053
the states of consciousness they're talking about.

565
00:21:46.053 --> 00:21:47.589
Because, until you experience it,

566
00:21:47.589 --> 00:21:49.093
it's not worth anything.

567
00:21:49.093 --> 00:21:50.351
<v ->Very true.</v>

568
00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:52.954
And what do you teach, when you're taking,

569
00:21:52.954 --> 00:21:55.620
let's say, you focus on relationships a lot,

570
00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.177
and relationships give us our greatest

571
00:21:57.177 --> 00:22:00.495
potential for growth and our greatest pain in life.

572
00:22:00.495 --> 00:22:02.446
How do you approach relationships

573
00:22:02.446 --> 00:22:05.209
from limited mind, to help expand the mind?

574
00:22:05.209 --> 00:22:06.926
So that people can find this

575
00:22:06.926 --> 00:22:08.925
harmony and peace between them?

576
00:22:09.007 --> 00:22:11.162
<v ->Well, I don't focus on relationships</v>

577
00:22:11.162 --> 00:22:12.975
in the sense of, like, a couples therapist,

578
00:22:12.975 --> 00:22:14.554
or Harville Hendrix's wonderful work

579
00:22:14.554 --> 00:22:16.879
with Imago, couples work.

580
00:22:16.879 --> 00:22:19.801
I basically say, consciousness is a relationship.

581
00:22:21.011 --> 00:22:23.034
As long as there's a contrast,

582
00:22:23.034 --> 00:22:24.473
consciousness can happen.

583
00:22:24.473 --> 00:22:26.511
So, the relationship I focus on

584
00:22:26.511 --> 00:22:29.326
is the relationship a person has to themself

585
00:22:29.326 --> 00:22:31.460
in the mirror of what's happening

586
00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.457
between you and the significant others in your life.

587
00:22:34.457 --> 00:22:37.422
So, I say, the relationship to self, to other,

588
00:22:37.422 --> 00:22:39.566
is the fundamental relationship.

589
00:22:39.566 --> 00:22:41.795
But that relationship depends upon

590
00:22:41.795 --> 00:22:44.717
an ineffable quality that we can call

591
00:22:44.717 --> 00:22:47.212
mystery, or source, or God.

592
00:22:47.212 --> 00:22:51.821
So, if I have a deep relationship in myself

593
00:22:51.821 --> 00:22:54.189
to that deeper level of mind,

594
00:22:54.189 --> 00:22:55.768
or that deeper level of awareness,

595
00:22:55.768 --> 00:22:58.605
which, ultimately, you can give it any name you want,

596
00:22:58.605 --> 00:23:03.223
but the name is just a word.

597
00:23:03.223 --> 00:23:07.607
That relationship I have to that source, that mystery,

598
00:23:07.607 --> 00:23:11.212
is what I intend to live in my relationship

599
00:23:11.212 --> 00:23:12.023
in my couple.

600
00:23:12.023 --> 00:23:13.836
But what if there's conflict in my couple?

601
00:23:13.836 --> 00:23:15.575
What if there's judgment?

602
00:23:15.575 --> 00:23:17.569
What if there's resentment?

603
00:23:17.569 --> 00:23:19.425
What if there's argument?

604
00:23:19.425 --> 00:23:21.100
Then I have to ask myself the question,

605
00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.475
and this is my work.

606
00:23:22.475 --> 00:23:24.001
This is what I teach, this is the path.

607
00:23:24.001 --> 00:23:25.494
What do I have to be telling myself,

608
00:23:25.494 --> 00:23:28.416
or believing, about myself, about her,

609
00:23:28.416 --> 00:23:31.179
or them, or it, maybe it's the government,

610
00:23:31.179 --> 00:23:33.195
or maybe it's a particular religion,

611
00:23:33.195 --> 00:23:36.192
maybe it's money, maybe it's my body.

612
00:23:36.192 --> 00:23:37.792
What do I have to be telling myself

613
00:23:37.792 --> 00:23:40.981
about myself, others, the past, and the future

614
00:23:40.981 --> 00:23:43.807
to be causing this conflict right now?

615
00:23:43.807 --> 00:23:45.994
To be causing this unhappiness?

616
00:23:45.994 --> 00:23:47.178
<v ->What's the story behind it?</v>

617
00:23:47.178 --> 00:23:48.426
<v ->What is the story?</v>

618
00:23:48.426 --> 00:23:50.175
And I look very clearly at,

619
00:23:50.175 --> 00:23:53.375
since the robot mind is built in time,

620
00:23:53.375 --> 00:23:55.700
time past, time future,

621
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.833
and the present moment nothing can be said about,

622
00:23:57.833 --> 00:23:59.198
you can't get outside of it.

623
00:23:59.198 --> 00:24:00.948
You can't say anything about the now.

624
00:24:00.948 --> 00:24:01.897
You can be in the now.

625
00:24:01.897 --> 00:24:02.868
You can dance in the now.

626
00:24:02.868 --> 00:24:04.915
You can ski in the now, make love in the now,

627
00:24:04.915 --> 00:24:06.846
write poetry in the now.

628
00:24:06.846 --> 00:24:09.097
But you can't talk about the now.

629
00:24:09.097 --> 00:24:11.976
The now is where you are--
<v Regina>It's unfolding...</v>

630
00:24:11.976 --> 00:24:13.384
right now!

631
00:24:13.384 --> 00:24:15.389
<v ->It's the only thing we have.
<v Regina>That's right.</v>

632
00:24:15.389 --> 00:24:17.960
<v ->But then we have this subject object split,</v>

633
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.592
when we're about the age of

634
00:24:19.592 --> 00:24:21.842
two, three, four, five, we begin to

635
00:24:21.842 --> 00:24:23.858
consolidate a sense of self,

636
00:24:23.858 --> 00:24:26.877
based on memory, based on imagining the future,

637
00:24:26.877 --> 00:24:30.365
based on judgments and interpretations of others,

638
00:24:30.365 --> 00:24:32.080
and based on judgments, stories,

639
00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.814
interpretations of ourselves.

640
00:24:34.814 --> 00:24:38.392
That basic, small ego is what's talking to us

641
00:24:38.392 --> 00:24:39.597
all the time.

642
00:24:39.597 --> 00:24:41.603
And it has many aspects to it.

643
00:24:41.603 --> 00:24:43.064
It can have a critic inside of it,

644
00:24:43.064 --> 00:24:44.802
it can have a bully inside of it,

645
00:24:44.802 --> 00:24:47.245
it can have a hero inside of it,

646
00:24:47.245 --> 00:24:50.797
it can have a saint, kind of, sub-personality inside of it.

647
00:24:50.797 --> 00:24:54.604
That's all driving ourselves, our behavior,

648
00:24:54.604 --> 00:24:56.535
in our relationships.

649
00:24:56.535 --> 00:25:00.940
But in the end, our relationships are failing.

650
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:04.471
We're failing to learn as much as we can learn

651
00:25:04.471 --> 00:25:05.964
about ourselves in relationships

652
00:25:05.964 --> 00:25:07.703
because we're still dreaming a dream

653
00:25:07.703 --> 00:25:09.772
that the relationship is supposed to fulfill us

654
00:25:09.772 --> 00:25:12.257
instead of make us conscious.

655
00:25:12.257 --> 00:25:15.734
So, for me, the conscious path of awakening

656
00:25:15.734 --> 00:25:18.849
is lived in the context of relationships.

657
00:25:18.849 --> 00:25:20.726
And you look in the mirror in those relationships,

658
00:25:20.726 --> 00:25:21.888
and you struggle.

659
00:25:21.888 --> 00:25:23.680
You struggle with your failings.

660
00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.440
You struggle with your judgmentalness.

661
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.435
You struggle with the difference.

662
00:25:27.435 --> 00:25:29.365
That's the important thing about a relationship,

663
00:25:29.365 --> 00:25:31.061
is that the other, is other.

664
00:25:31.061 --> 00:25:33.941
Whether the otherness is gender, you know,

665
00:25:33.941 --> 00:25:35.978
because biology takes the one,

666
00:25:35.978 --> 00:25:37.333
divides it in half, in order to create

667
00:25:37.333 --> 00:25:38.483
another one.

668
00:25:38.483 --> 00:25:40.671
Whether it's a gender difference,

669
00:25:40.671 --> 00:25:42.956
which is basic.

670
00:25:42.956 --> 00:25:46.998
Or, whether it's the inculturation of each gender,

671
00:25:46.998 --> 00:25:50.571
which is a profound overlay that comes

672
00:25:50.571 --> 00:25:54.102
streaming to us through the millenia,

673
00:25:55.632 --> 00:25:58.202
limiting women and limiting men.

674
00:25:58.212 --> 00:26:00.716
But if we're going to work out those kinds of things,

675
00:26:00.716 --> 00:26:03.927
we're going to work them out in the now, communication,

676
00:26:03.927 --> 00:26:05.175
and we're going to have to find a way

677
00:26:05.175 --> 00:26:07.639
to deal with our anger, and pain, and fear,

678
00:26:07.639 --> 00:26:09.751
and abandonment, judgmentalness.

679
00:26:09.751 --> 00:26:11.265
And to do that we have to learn

680
00:26:11.265 --> 00:26:13.612
a practice for getting really quiet

681
00:26:13.612 --> 00:26:15.446
and then meeting each other again and again

682
00:26:15.446 --> 00:26:16.790
from that quietness,

683
00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:18.945
so that we can be resourced.

684
00:26:18.945 --> 00:26:20.779
<v ->And just because you accomplish this</v>

685
00:26:20.779 --> 00:26:22.219
one time or even a hundred times,

686
00:26:22.219 --> 00:26:23.542
doesn't mean the issue goes away.

687
00:26:23.542 --> 00:26:25.824
As you were stating in your talk yesterday,

688
00:26:25.824 --> 00:26:27.701
you can go and you can be at a conference

689
00:26:27.701 --> 00:26:29.739
and you can be in your glory,

690
00:26:29.739 --> 00:26:32.341
sharing your wisdom and information with people,

691
00:26:32.341 --> 00:26:33.621
and you're in your groove,

692
00:26:33.621 --> 00:26:35.381
go home and get in a petty argument,

693
00:26:35.381 --> 00:26:37.333
as you stated, with your wife.

694
00:26:37.333 --> 00:26:39.306
<v ->Yeah, exactly.
<v Regina>You know?</v>

695
00:26:39.306 --> 00:26:40.661
We're being pulled--

696
00:26:40.661 --> 00:26:42.517
what is that part of us that's

697
00:26:42.517 --> 00:26:44.671
constantly pulling us off,

698
00:26:44.671 --> 00:26:48.437
and how do you quickly recover yourself from that?

699
00:26:48.437 --> 00:26:50.527
<v ->Well, basically, the deeper mind</v>

700
00:26:50.527 --> 00:26:53.898
is a mind in the present, not a mind in the future.

701
00:26:53.898 --> 00:26:55.199
Being able to go into the future

702
00:26:55.199 --> 00:26:56.884
has survival value.

703
00:26:56.884 --> 00:26:58.772
However, if you're not really anchored

704
00:26:58.772 --> 00:27:01.044
in something very present and now,

705
00:27:01.044 --> 00:27:02.740
the way you imagine the future

706
00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.596
and the way you imagine where you want to go

707
00:27:04.596 --> 00:27:08.510
is not necessarily going to lead you to a good place.

708
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:11.126
<v ->Give me an example of how that mind would work</v>

709
00:27:11.126 --> 00:27:12.705
when you end up in a situation

710
00:27:12.705 --> 00:27:14.102
like what I was just talking about.

711
00:27:14.102 --> 00:27:15.798
How do you take from the past,

712
00:27:15.798 --> 00:27:18.049
run it through the now to the future,

713
00:27:18.049 --> 00:27:19.446
to create scenarios that, often,

714
00:27:19.446 --> 00:27:21.579
aren't even true, but the kind of pickles that,

715
00:27:21.579 --> 00:27:23.616
say, you in your past have put yourself

716
00:27:23.616 --> 00:27:25.728
in these situations?

717
00:27:25.728 --> 00:27:28.128
What's it look like in every one of us, raw?

718
00:27:31.038 --> 00:27:33.525
<v ->Well, first, before you said, "well, what do we do?"</v>

719
00:27:33.525 --> 00:27:35.584
We have to learn to stay more in the present.

720
00:27:35.584 --> 00:27:37.610
Different kind of intelligence.

721
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:39.114
Then we have to learn the consequences

722
00:27:39.114 --> 00:27:41.696
of what happens when I have an argument

723
00:27:41.696 --> 00:27:43.733
with my wife and I say to myself,

724
00:27:43.733 --> 00:27:45.226
"this is never gonna work.

725
00:27:45.226 --> 00:27:46.751
"She's never gonna change.

726
00:27:46.751 --> 00:27:48.426
"I'm just going to be wasting my life."

727
00:27:48.426 --> 00:27:49.663
Those are the kinds of thoughts we say.

728
00:27:49.663 --> 00:27:52.330
Those thoughts are about ourselves

729
00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:54.367
in the present, or ourselves in the future.

730
00:27:54.367 --> 00:27:57.140
Those thoughts create despair.

731
00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.894
They create fear, anxiety, worry.

732
00:28:00.894 --> 00:28:02.569
And it builds a picture,

733
00:28:02.569 --> 00:28:04.211
an imaginary picture of a life of

734
00:28:04.211 --> 00:28:06.355
unhappiness in the future.

735
00:28:06.355 --> 00:28:08.190
Then the mind says, "what can I do

736
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:09.534
"to make myself happy?"

737
00:28:09.534 --> 00:28:11.112
So then it starts to create other thoughts.

738
00:28:11.112 --> 00:28:12.766
The thoughts are, "well, I'll leave her."

739
00:28:12.766 --> 00:28:16.317
Or, "I just won't pay attention to her."

740
00:28:16.317 --> 00:28:18.824
Or, "I'll find someone else."

741
00:28:18.824 --> 00:28:20.722
Or, "that other guy was more interesting.

742
00:28:20.722 --> 00:28:23.538
"I'm just noticing that woman is getting kind of..."

743
00:28:23.538 --> 00:28:26.365
and we start to look outside to the next relationship

744
00:28:26.365 --> 00:28:27.922
that we imagine will complete us.

745
00:28:27.922 --> 00:28:29.458
That's what we do.

746
00:28:29.458 --> 00:28:32.306
We leave the now into a provisional,

747
00:28:32.306 --> 00:28:34.375
imaginary, hypothetical world,

748
00:28:34.375 --> 00:28:36.380
created in our minds,

749
00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.164
and it's a future world, that's going

750
00:28:39.164 --> 00:28:40.401
to make us happy.

751
00:28:40.401 --> 00:28:42.353
Just like we leave the now, because

752
00:28:42.353 --> 00:28:43.656
we're in conflict, we're in pain,

753
00:28:43.656 --> 00:28:45.725
we don't feel seen, we don't feel understood,

754
00:28:45.725 --> 00:28:49.831
we feel judged, we are being judgmental.

755
00:28:49.831 --> 00:28:51.900
It always works both ways.

756
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.340
And then we're having a hypothetical

757
00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.546
and imaginary future, in which

758
00:28:54.546 --> 00:28:58.332
we're going to be forever unhappy and dissatisfied,

759
00:28:58.332 --> 00:29:01.628
and so we have to do something about that.

760
00:29:01.628 --> 00:29:04.480
And we actually believe those words

761
00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.474
that we are creating in our heads.

762
00:29:06.474 --> 00:29:09.354
And if we would stop, and wait without thought,

763
00:29:09.354 --> 00:29:10.453
because we're not ready for thought,

764
00:29:10.453 --> 00:29:12.725
we're not ready for a thought about the future.

765
00:29:12.725 --> 00:29:13.812
<v ->Particularly when we're in the middle</v>

766
00:29:13.812 --> 00:29:15.626
of an emotional reaction or response.

767
00:29:15.626 --> 00:29:17.044
<v ->Particularly, exactly.</v>

768
00:29:17.044 --> 00:29:20.639
Whenever we are muddy, with an emotional reaction,

769
00:29:20.639 --> 00:29:23.678
we will not think properly.

770
00:29:23.678 --> 00:29:25.172
We cannot think properly.

771
00:29:25.172 --> 00:29:27.486
Our thinking will simply be a reaction

772
00:29:27.486 --> 00:29:28.702
to the emotion,

773
00:29:28.702 --> 00:29:31.251
and the thinking will create a new emotion.

774
00:29:31.251 --> 00:29:33.385
So the thinking that creates hope for the future,

775
00:29:33.385 --> 00:29:34.878
when I meet the right guy,

776
00:29:34.878 --> 00:29:36.851
or get the right job, or have more money,

777
00:29:36.851 --> 00:29:39.773
or finally get the house we need,

778
00:29:39.773 --> 00:29:41.651
or downsize to something more--

779
00:29:41.651 --> 00:29:43.741
whatever that thinking is.

780
00:29:43.741 --> 00:29:46.322
And now, I can hear someone, about their thinking,

781
00:29:46.322 --> 00:29:47.762
"but how do you solve problems?

782
00:29:47.762 --> 00:29:49.362
"Don't you have to solve problems?"

783
00:29:49.362 --> 00:29:50.759
Yes, you have to solve problems,

784
00:29:50.759 --> 00:29:52.445
but where are you going to start from?

785
00:29:52.445 --> 00:29:54.077
If you're going to navigate your life,

786
00:29:54.077 --> 00:29:56.007
are you going to start from an imaginary future

787
00:29:56.007 --> 00:29:57.980
where you think your problem will be solved?

788
00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:00.545
Or are you going to start from the present moment,

789
00:30:00.545 --> 00:30:02.994
and stop reacting to what you're feeling

790
00:30:02.994 --> 00:30:04.647
and get quiet enough to realize

791
00:30:04.647 --> 00:30:08.305
how the real issue isn't what I thought it was.

792
00:30:08.305 --> 00:30:12.145
The real issue is my judgments of my wife,

793
00:30:12.145 --> 00:30:14.140
or my judgments of myself,

794
00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.252
or my judgments of my job.

795
00:30:16.252 --> 00:30:18.225
And I try to tell people over and over again.

796
00:30:18.225 --> 00:30:19.729
Don't change your job,

797
00:30:19.729 --> 00:30:21.083
don't change your career,

798
00:30:21.083 --> 00:30:23.931
until you're so connected to yourself,

799
00:30:23.931 --> 00:30:25.371
and then you won't have to change.

800
00:30:25.371 --> 00:30:26.470
The world will come to you

801
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:27.835
and offer you a new job.

802
00:30:27.835 --> 00:30:29.968
Happens every day.
<v Regina>It does.</v>

803
00:30:29.968 --> 00:30:32.155
Let's talk about baby steps.

804
00:30:32.155 --> 00:30:33.317
Baby steps in getting there.

805
00:30:33.317 --> 00:30:34.960
Okay, you have the presence

806
00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.840
to stop yourself in the moment,

807
00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:38.746
in the middle of something

808
00:30:38.746 --> 00:30:39.813
that you find uncomfortable,

809
00:30:39.813 --> 00:30:41.978
that you're reacting to emotionally.

810
00:30:41.978 --> 00:30:43.514
You say, "okay, I'm supposed to stop now.

811
00:30:43.514 --> 00:30:45.316
"Richard said I'm supposed to stop."

812
00:30:45.316 --> 00:30:47.663
Tell us what happens from there.

813
00:30:48.923 --> 00:30:50.714
<v ->Well, first of all, this is,</v>

814
00:30:50.714 --> 00:30:53.498
in my most recent book, the Mandala of Being,

815
00:30:53.498 --> 00:30:55.866
I literally lay out what we do,

816
00:30:55.866 --> 00:30:57.498
and how we can stop--
<v Regina>Yes, and I was in--</v>

817
00:30:57.498 --> 00:30:59.077
<v ->So, the first thing you need to know</v>

818
00:30:59.077 --> 00:31:01.764
is when you leave, there's only four places you will go.

819
00:31:01.764 --> 00:31:03.759
The future, the past, stories about yourself,

820
00:31:03.759 --> 00:31:05.156
stories about others.

821
00:31:05.156 --> 00:31:06.991
When you recognize you're doing that,

822
00:31:06.991 --> 00:31:08.633
that immediately helps you come back.

823
00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:09.657
Baby steps.

824
00:31:09.657 --> 00:31:11.076
Have a compass in your hand that says,

825
00:31:11.076 --> 00:31:12.217
now I'm too far in the future,

826
00:31:12.217 --> 00:31:13.796
and you start again in the present.

827
00:31:13.796 --> 00:31:15.065
That's one baby step.

828
00:31:15.065 --> 00:31:17.326
Baby step, learn to stay in your body.

829
00:31:17.326 --> 00:31:19.694
Tune in, get into your body,

830
00:31:19.694 --> 00:31:21.571
recognize whether it's tense,

831
00:31:21.571 --> 00:31:22.659
relax tension,

832
00:31:22.659 --> 00:31:24.376
because, as soon as you relax the body,

833
00:31:24.376 --> 00:31:26.438
you start to calm the mind.

834
00:31:26.438 --> 00:31:29.428
All of the Eastern traditions, Eastern philosophies,

835
00:31:29.428 --> 00:31:31.028
which are really practices,

836
00:31:31.028 --> 00:31:32.532
as we mentioned a little while ago,

837
00:31:32.532 --> 00:31:35.209
are actually based on working through the body

838
00:31:35.209 --> 00:31:36.627
to quiet the mind.

839
00:31:36.627 --> 00:31:38.291
Or, working through mantra,

840
00:31:38.291 --> 00:31:41.587
which are specific mental constructions, or sounds,

841
00:31:41.587 --> 00:31:44.848
to absorb the mind, distract the mind,

842
00:31:44.848 --> 00:31:48.233
to stop it from its constant fabrication

843
00:31:48.233 --> 00:31:49.950
of imaginary--
<v Regina>Its loops, yeah.</v>

844
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.667
<v ->Well, it's, they're always imaginary.</v>

845
00:31:51.667 --> 00:31:53.363
We're imagining what we want,

846
00:31:53.363 --> 00:31:55.592
or we're imagining what we don't want,

847
00:31:55.592 --> 00:31:57.405
instead of living right where we are.

848
00:31:57.405 --> 00:31:59.005
The present is never vivid.

849
00:31:59.005 --> 00:32:00.136
When the present is vivid,

850
00:32:00.136 --> 00:32:01.416
the nature of the vivid present

851
00:32:01.416 --> 00:32:04.232
is an intrinsic sense of joy,

852
00:32:04.232 --> 00:32:06.013
and intrinsic sense of well-being,

853
00:32:06.013 --> 00:32:07.826
and so we're not going to make the same choices.

854
00:32:07.826 --> 00:32:09.959
But, in terms of baby steps,

855
00:32:09.959 --> 00:32:12.285
I have a free course on my website,

856
00:32:12.285 --> 00:32:14.812
which is a five week course.

857
00:32:14.812 --> 00:32:15.954
It's completely free.

858
00:32:15.954 --> 00:32:19.345
And it literally teaches how to come back to the present.

859
00:32:19.345 --> 00:32:21.639
How to recognize the way the mind tricks you

860
00:32:21.639 --> 00:32:23.964
into the future or the past, and so forth.

861
00:32:23.964 --> 00:32:25.382
How the mind will take you away

862
00:32:25.382 --> 00:32:27.633
from something difficult,

863
00:32:27.633 --> 00:32:29.094
it's trying to protect you,

864
00:32:29.094 --> 00:32:31.249
but if you don't stay consciously present,

865
00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:34.384
waiting, without hope, in a difficult feeling,

866
00:32:34.384 --> 00:32:37.104
you'll never grow faith in your true self.

867
00:32:37.104 --> 00:32:39.632
You'll constantly be running away.

868
00:32:39.632 --> 00:32:40.656
And I think that's the story of

869
00:32:40.656 --> 00:32:42.235
our six and a half billion people,

870
00:32:42.235 --> 00:32:45.328
and the 10 or 20 billion that lived before us.

871
00:32:45.328 --> 00:32:47.365
The story of humanity is not so much

872
00:32:47.365 --> 00:32:49.573
what we've imagined into life,

873
00:32:49.573 --> 00:32:51.471
but what we ran away from,

874
00:32:51.471 --> 00:32:53.082
in order to imagine so much of

875
00:32:53.082 --> 00:32:54.842
our accomplishments into life.

876
00:32:54.842 --> 00:32:58.074
People, a humanity that has faced

877
00:32:58.074 --> 00:33:01.604
deep and essential and fundamental fears,

878
00:33:01.604 --> 00:33:03.919
in a now moment process

879
00:33:03.919 --> 00:33:05.892
of waiting and being present,

880
00:33:05.892 --> 00:33:08.590
is a free humanity that can build a world

881
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:11.747
that is much more compassionate, fair,

882
00:33:11.747 --> 00:33:14.574
a celebration of the wholeness

883
00:33:14.574 --> 00:33:16.920
that we each are, and that this world is,

884
00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.755
but which we cannot see,

885
00:33:18.755 --> 00:33:20.387
until we get quiet.

886
00:33:20.387 --> 00:33:22.168
<v ->Because you have gotten quiet</v>

887
00:33:22.168 --> 00:33:24.472
and sustained it for long periods of time,

888
00:33:24.472 --> 00:33:27.139
explain to us what it feels like

889
00:33:27.139 --> 00:33:28.792
and what the experience of

890
00:33:28.792 --> 00:33:31.853
standing in the middle of the experience

891
00:33:31.853 --> 00:33:33.335
of true mind,

892
00:33:33.335 --> 00:33:35.031
and going through a day,

893
00:33:35.031 --> 00:33:35.895
going through life,

894
00:33:35.895 --> 00:33:37.357
going through situations.

895
00:33:37.357 --> 00:33:39.085
<v ->Well, first of all,</v>

896
00:33:40.744 --> 00:33:43.602
it's an amazing experience of the body,

897
00:33:43.602 --> 00:33:47.037
as if the body were solid,

898
00:33:47.037 --> 00:33:48.733
but you could breathe through it.

899
00:33:48.733 --> 00:33:51.356
And there's a sense of, a kind of current.

900
00:33:51.356 --> 00:33:52.487
Something that's welling up

901
00:33:52.487 --> 00:33:54.791
from, I don't know where,

902
00:33:54.791 --> 00:33:58.108
that gives a very gentle sense of bliss.

903
00:33:58.108 --> 00:33:59.687
Not, kind of, an ecstatic state

904
00:33:59.687 --> 00:34:03.100
that you might achieve through a chemical,

905
00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.941
or after some really great downhill ski run,

906
00:34:06.941 --> 00:34:09.081
or something like that.

907
00:34:09.081 --> 00:34:11.553
Or because you just won the lottery.

908
00:34:11.553 --> 00:34:15.639
This is a very soft, incredibly nourishing thing

909
00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:17.292
that I experience all the time.

910
00:34:17.292 --> 00:34:20.033
And, of course, the light, then I perceive.

911
00:34:20.033 --> 00:34:23.137
My perceptions become so alive,

912
00:34:23.137 --> 00:34:25.387
the light is almost scintillating,

913
00:34:25.387 --> 00:34:27.510
and the colors are very bright.

914
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.312
And I feel like, there's a communication.

915
00:34:29.312 --> 00:34:31.008
I'm being breathed by this world

916
00:34:31.008 --> 00:34:31.851
that I'm looking at,

917
00:34:31.851 --> 00:34:33.803
and it's breathing me, and I'm breathing it.

918
00:34:33.803 --> 00:34:36.491
In fact, that experience of, I'm not being breathed,

919
00:34:36.491 --> 00:34:39.434
I'm not breathing, it's not Richard who breathes,

920
00:34:39.434 --> 00:34:41.269
or even Richard's body that breathes,

921
00:34:41.269 --> 00:34:43.594
it's almost that Richard's body is breathed

922
00:34:43.594 --> 00:34:45.962
by something more.

923
00:34:45.962 --> 00:34:48.404
And, in that place, I am able

924
00:34:48.404 --> 00:34:50.516
to look with a great deal of clarity,

925
00:34:50.516 --> 00:34:53.577
and not judgment, at what my mind has done

926
00:34:53.577 --> 00:34:55.945
to create stress or unhappiness,

927
00:34:55.945 --> 00:34:59.017
and the stress melts away pretty quickly.

928
00:34:59.017 --> 00:35:00.756
Then I can start all over again.

929
00:35:00.756 --> 00:35:03.614
It's like, somebody's just taken that plastic--

930
00:35:03.614 --> 00:35:04.521
you know, that children's thing,

931
00:35:04.521 --> 00:35:05.726
where you can write on it,

932
00:35:05.726 --> 00:35:09.480
and you see it, and then you pull up the plastic sheet,

933
00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.942
and it all gets erased?

934
00:35:10.942 --> 00:35:13.662
<v ->Yeah, like refreshing the page on the computer.</v>

935
00:35:13.662 --> 00:35:15.773
<v ->Something like that, except--</v>

936
00:35:15.773 --> 00:35:16.840
<v ->The refresh button.</v>

937
00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.333
<v ->Except it just come back</v>

938
00:35:18.333 --> 00:35:20.701
to a basic sense of gratitude

939
00:35:20.701 --> 00:35:22.440
and, I mean, all of my work,

940
00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.445
all of my teaching, starts from this place.

941
00:35:24.445 --> 00:35:25.778
Because then I look at the world,

942
00:35:25.778 --> 00:35:28.029
and I look at the suffering I've created in myself,

943
00:35:28.029 --> 00:35:29.821
and I know that I create suffering

944
00:35:29.821 --> 00:35:31.538
in the exact way everybody does,

945
00:35:31.538 --> 00:35:33.810
so I understand how everyone creates their suffering,

946
00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:36.071
which gives me a sense of compassion,

947
00:35:36.071 --> 00:35:37.298
but it gives me a desire to go out

948
00:35:37.298 --> 00:35:39.414
and help people do something

949
00:35:39.414 --> 00:35:40.811
to stop that suffering,

950
00:35:40.811 --> 00:35:43.125
because I know how to stop it in myself,

951
00:35:43.125 --> 00:35:44.779
and have made some progress,

952
00:35:44.779 --> 00:35:46.432
so now I can help others.

953
00:35:46.432 --> 00:35:49.418
And I want to.

954
00:35:49.418 --> 00:35:53.397
It's not a question of, oh, it's my mission.

955
00:35:53.397 --> 00:35:56.618
It's so innate.

956
00:35:56.618 --> 00:36:01.610
You cannot help but want to show someone else

957
00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:03.348
the richness of life.

958
00:36:03.348 --> 00:36:05.673
If you've had a taste of the richness of life,

959
00:36:05.673 --> 00:36:08.137
and it's a richness that's really

960
00:36:08.137 --> 00:36:10.900
very much independent of circumstances.

961
00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:13.545
To a certain degree.

962
00:36:13.545 --> 00:36:14.611
I mean, I have to go out and do

963
00:36:14.611 --> 00:36:15.556
the same things everyone else does.

964
00:36:15.556 --> 00:36:17.881
Get food, repair things in the house,

965
00:36:17.881 --> 00:36:22.123
earn a living, and that means plan the future.

966
00:36:22.123 --> 00:36:24.617
It means making commitments to things

967
00:36:24.617 --> 00:36:26.100
that may not take place for another,

968
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.169
in my case, I often have a schedule

969
00:36:28.169 --> 00:36:29.705
that's two years ahead of me.

970
00:36:29.705 --> 00:36:31.721
But what I know about that

971
00:36:31.721 --> 00:36:32.702
is that, I'm going to arrive,

972
00:36:32.702 --> 00:36:34.953
two years from now, if I'm alive,

973
00:36:34.953 --> 00:36:36.254
in the now.

974
00:36:36.254 --> 00:36:37.129
And it's not going to be any different

975
00:36:37.129 --> 00:36:38.504
than this now.

976
00:36:38.504 --> 00:36:41.214
I may be with you, and I haven't been with you before.

977
00:36:41.214 --> 00:36:43.475
But I'm with you from that place

978
00:36:43.475 --> 00:36:45.672
inside of me that is timeless.

979
00:36:45.672 --> 00:36:47.229
And from that place of listening,

980
00:36:47.229 --> 00:36:50.856
or essence, that has no beginning and no end,

981
00:36:50.856 --> 00:36:55.495
and is not nameable, which is the real core of all of us.

982
00:36:55.495 --> 00:36:57.661
And then we start a relationship.

983
00:36:57.661 --> 00:37:01.116
And the relationship can be immensely satisfying.

984
00:37:01.116 --> 00:37:02.674
And the amazing thing is,

985
00:37:02.674 --> 00:37:06.012
you can be surprised and immensely satisfied

986
00:37:06.012 --> 00:37:08.871
in a relationship that has an enormous history,

987
00:37:08.871 --> 00:37:11.292
including a history of hurt.

988
00:37:11.292 --> 00:37:13.542
Because it's a past hurt.

989
00:37:13.542 --> 00:37:15.068
And if you give a relationship a chance

990
00:37:15.068 --> 00:37:17.094
to be reborn in the now,

991
00:37:17.094 --> 00:37:18.993
with all of its history,

992
00:37:18.993 --> 00:37:22.010
that relationship is what has a mature love in it,

993
00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:25.436
not a new, wonderfully- delicious

994
00:37:25.436 --> 00:37:28.593
infatuational kind of romantic love,

995
00:37:28.593 --> 00:37:30.268
but a mature love.

996
00:37:30.268 --> 00:37:32.678
Mature love is a very different feeling

997
00:37:32.678 --> 00:37:34.069
than romantic love.

998
00:37:35.139 --> 00:37:36.603
<v ->That begs the question,</v>

999
00:37:36.603 --> 00:37:38.416
because you have been influenced

1000
00:37:38.416 --> 00:37:42.342
by Eastern traditions--
<v Richard>You might want to</v>

1001
00:37:42.342 --> 00:37:44.496
say this, I've been influenced by Eastern traditions

1002
00:37:44.496 --> 00:37:46.149
after I woke up.

1003
00:37:46.149 --> 00:37:47.312
<v ->After you woke up, okay.</v>

1004
00:37:47.312 --> 00:37:48.837
<v ->I did not study them at all.</v>

1005
00:37:48.837 --> 00:37:51.952
When I had the experience of landing

1006
00:37:51.952 --> 00:37:56.952
in the now of myself, unified in my being,

1007
00:37:57.199 --> 00:37:59.322
religious experience, mystical experience,

1008
00:37:59.322 --> 00:38:02.084
and then I became fascinated by

1009
00:38:02.084 --> 00:38:04.025
the Eastern traditions in particular,

1010
00:38:04.025 --> 00:38:05.977
because they're so pragmatic.

1011
00:38:05.977 --> 00:38:06.980
<v ->Okay.</v>

1012
00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.676
And from that perspective, then,

1013
00:38:08.676 --> 00:38:10.457
and having experienced this, and, I'm sure,

1014
00:38:10.457 --> 00:38:13.177
you've been in many different cultures,

1015
00:38:13.177 --> 00:38:14.361
do you notice a difference in

1016
00:38:14.361 --> 00:38:17.593
the maturity level of relationships

1017
00:38:17.593 --> 00:38:19.886
in areas of the world in which

1018
00:38:19.886 --> 00:38:22.958
these practices are held dear and adhered to,

1019
00:38:22.958 --> 00:38:26.371
versus the Western world, the United States,

1020
00:38:26.371 --> 00:38:28.312
you know, we're here right now.

1021
00:38:28.312 --> 00:38:29.805
Do you notice a difference?

1022
00:38:29.805 --> 00:38:30.914
<v ->I haven't taught in Asia,</v>

1023
00:38:30.914 --> 00:38:33.240
so I can't say I've been in Asian cultures.

1024
00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.096
I've certainly met many people

1025
00:38:35.096 --> 00:38:37.175
who have been students of Buddhism,

1026
00:38:37.175 --> 00:38:39.746
and various Hindu practices.

1027
00:38:39.746 --> 00:38:42.071
And, you know, if you find a good teacher,

1028
00:38:42.071 --> 00:38:44.855
and you let that teacher influence your life,

1029
00:38:44.855 --> 00:38:46.370
a true teacher's going to teach you

1030
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:49.153
how to come into the now of yourself.

1031
00:38:51.133 --> 00:38:52.760
I think we make a lot of mistakes

1032
00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.936
with Eastern traditions that are about enlightenment,

1033
00:38:54.936 --> 00:38:56.269
because we don't understand,

1034
00:38:56.269 --> 00:38:59.095
enlightenment is always in a context.

1035
00:38:59.095 --> 00:39:01.069
So I'm only as enlightened, as I am

1036
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:02.391
in that specific context,

1037
00:39:02.391 --> 00:39:03.735
and if that happens to be when you're

1038
00:39:03.735 --> 00:39:06.572
listening to your 16 year old who doesn't want to study

1039
00:39:06.572 --> 00:39:08.108
and is smoking too much pot,

1040
00:39:08.108 --> 00:39:09.751
you'll find out how enlightened you are.

1041
00:39:09.751 --> 00:39:10.817
Or if the context is, you go home

1042
00:39:10.817 --> 00:39:11.959
and you visit your parents,

1043
00:39:11.959 --> 00:39:13.655
as Ramdas said years ago,

1044
00:39:13.655 --> 00:39:14.998
you want to find out how enlightened you are?

1045
00:39:14.998 --> 00:39:16.556
Go home and visit your parents.

1046
00:39:16.556 --> 00:39:18.572
Enlightenment is always in a context.

1047
00:39:20.922 --> 00:39:22.594
So, then what I would say is,

1048
00:39:22.594 --> 00:39:24.908
consider yourself only as enlightened

1049
00:39:24.908 --> 00:39:29.025
as you are in the context that brings out the worst in you.

1050
00:39:29.025 --> 00:39:30.668
That's your level of enlightenment.

1051
00:39:30.668 --> 00:39:33.089
Not in the context that brings out the best in you.

1052
00:39:33.089 --> 00:39:36.342
<v ->Well, on that note, that's perfectly said,</v>

1053
00:39:36.342 --> 00:39:37.846
and that's wonderful that you offer

1054
00:39:37.846 --> 00:39:41.099
this course on getting centered in this way,

1055
00:39:41.099 --> 00:39:42.518
free to the public.

1056
00:39:42.518 --> 00:39:44.960
I very much appreciate that kind of work.

1057
00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.741
And you have other resources

1058
00:39:46.741 --> 00:39:48.320
people can dip into, as well,

1059
00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.464
and I know you've got to catch a plane in a minute,

1060
00:39:50.464 --> 00:39:52.736
and I thank you very much for your time.

1061
00:39:52.736 --> 00:39:54.293
<v ->My privilege.</v>

1062
00:39:54.293 --> 00:39:56.127
This is what my life is about.

1063
00:39:56.127 --> 00:39:58.517
And thank you for why you're doing this.

1064
00:39:58.517 --> 00:40:01.550
Just to serve consciousness.

1065
00:40:04.138 --> 00:40:05.524
<v ->You can go to Richard's website</v>
