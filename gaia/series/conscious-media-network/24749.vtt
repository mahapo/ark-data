00:00:00.424 --> 00:00:03.815
<v ->I had an experience in May of 2001 that put to rest</v>

2
00:00:03.815 --> 00:00:07.005
any skepticism that mankind has been visited

3
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:10.012
by extraterrestrials throughout our existence.

4
00:00:10.012 --> 00:00:12.476
It was during the Disclosure Project press conference

5
00:00:12.476 --> 00:00:15.192
at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.

6
00:00:15.192 --> 00:00:16.983
I was behind the scenes and met with several

7
00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:21.089
of the witnesses, including a man named Sgt. Clifford Stone.

8
00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:23.883
While his story was controversial, I was intrigued with him

9
00:00:23.883 --> 00:00:25.410
and what he had to say.

10
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.584
In September of this year, 2008,

11
00:00:27.584 --> 00:00:30.860
I met with Clifford once again at the Bay Area UFO Expo,

12
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.469
and had him share his story on camera.

13
00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.869
You see, Clifford's job in the US Army

14
00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:39.826
was to communicate with ETs at UFO crash sites.

15
00:00:39.826 --> 00:00:44.826 line:15% 
(spacey music)

16
00:00:49.024 --> 00:00:52.144
Clifford, you've been in and around the UFO phenomena

17
00:00:52.144 --> 00:00:54.582
for how many years? Over 40 years?

18
00:00:55.773 --> 00:00:56.850
<v ->Well over 40 years.</v>

19
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.108
<v Interviewer>Well over 40 years.</v>

20
00:00:58.108 --> 00:01:00.710
<v ->Actually going on,</v>

21
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.990
it's over 50 years.

22
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:06.379
<v Interviewer>And because this started for you very young,</v>

23
00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:09.066
I want to ask a big question first,

24
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:12.618
and then go back into your roots in this area,

25
00:01:12.618 --> 00:01:15.111
because your story's unique.

26
00:01:16.231 --> 00:01:17.868
I heard your presentation a little while ago,

27
00:01:17.868 --> 00:01:20.321
and it was talking about why the Congress

28
00:01:20.321 --> 00:01:24.535
of the United States has not yet

29
00:01:24.535 --> 00:01:25.879
seriously taken on

30
00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:30.262
the subject of extraterrestrial possibilities,

31
00:01:30.262 --> 00:01:33.579
UFO technologies, and so forth, and come clean with this

32
00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:34.977
with the public.

33
00:01:34.977 --> 00:01:37.216
Can you give us an overview of why

34
00:01:37.216 --> 00:01:40.459
this is still being covered up and stagnated as it is

35
00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:42.237
all these years later?

36
00:01:42.237 --> 00:01:44.093
<v ->Well, ma'am, some of the people in Congress</v>

37
00:01:44.093 --> 00:01:46.899
already know that we do have visitors here.

38
00:01:47.747 --> 00:01:49.984
However, it's politically sensitive.

39
00:01:50.907 --> 00:01:53.894
The US government wants to go ahead and keep a low key

40
00:01:53.894 --> 00:01:57.371
on anything that may have advanced technology involved

41
00:01:57.371 --> 00:02:00.615
just so they will have

42
00:02:00.615 --> 00:02:03.935
the advanced technology

43
00:02:03.935 --> 00:02:06.107
above and beyond those of other countries.

44
00:02:06.107 --> 00:02:09.786
Also, we are not certain how people are gonna react

45
00:02:09.786 --> 00:02:13.456
once we tell them that there is other living beings

46
00:02:13.456 --> 00:02:16.794
out there in space, and they are already coming here.

47
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.244
Everybody says that we can deal with it,

48
00:02:20.244 --> 00:02:22.187
but we aren't sure of that.

49
00:02:22.187 --> 00:02:25.546
Now, given that we want to keep a lot of things secret

50
00:02:25.546 --> 00:02:28.672
in the interest of giving us a militarily,

51
00:02:28.672 --> 00:02:33.051
technologically edge in any future wars,

52
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:35.611
that's not justification to keep this information

53
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:37.008
under wraps.

54
00:02:38.218 --> 00:02:41.966
I know of cases where people have killed themselves,

55
00:02:43.046 --> 00:02:46.122
lost their families, lost their jobs,

56
00:02:46.122 --> 00:02:50.802
and we're wrong in doing that.

57
00:02:51.874 --> 00:02:53.613
<v Interviewer>Yes, we are wrong in doing that.</v>

58
00:02:53.613 --> 00:02:54.839
I would agree with you.

59
00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:56.845
<v ->So that's the reason I feel the truth has to come,</v>

60
00:02:56.845 --> 00:02:58.679
but it has to be done responsibly.

61
00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.015
<v Interviewer>Now, that said, first of all,</v>

62
00:03:01.015 --> 00:03:05.324
you have one of the largest archives of original documents

63
00:03:05.324 --> 00:03:10.173
and copied documents both on the subject of UFOs and ET.

64
00:03:10.173 --> 00:03:11.044
<v ->Yes, ma'am.</v>

65
00:03:11.044 --> 00:03:12.324
<v Interviewer>Not just technologies,</v>

66
00:03:12.324 --> 00:03:15.942
but, shall we say, visitations and so forth.

67
00:03:16.952 --> 00:03:20.006
So you have quite a lot to draw on on a personal level.

68
00:03:21.226 --> 00:03:23.426
Now, one of the areas

69
00:03:23.426 --> 00:03:27.981
that was mentioned by one of your colleagues yesterday,

70
00:03:27.981 --> 00:03:30.664
by Bob Dean, was that

71
00:03:30.664 --> 00:03:34.782
the scramble for bucks in Congress,

72
00:03:34.782 --> 00:03:38.547
the whole budgetary issue, really seems to be at the crux

73
00:03:38.547 --> 00:03:41.246
of why a lot of this information hasn't been released,

74
00:03:41.246 --> 00:03:43.923
with one committee struggling to get dollars

75
00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:46.674
for their particular agenda, and another for another.

76
00:03:46.674 --> 00:03:49.203
And this is such a controversial topic

77
00:03:49.203 --> 00:03:52.386
that no one wants to jeopardize their budgets

78
00:03:52.386 --> 00:03:54.370
to pursue anything in earnest here.

79
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.876
Is that your take on it too?

80
00:03:56.876 --> 00:03:57.976
<v ->Oh, yes, ma'am.</v>

81
00:04:00.325 --> 00:04:03.343
Man is greedy. Man will go ahead and put dollars

82
00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:05.040
ahead of common sense.

83
00:04:05.964 --> 00:04:08.662
Common sense dictates that if there's a phenomena

84
00:04:08.662 --> 00:04:12.137
out there that is gonna have an impact

85
00:04:12.137 --> 00:04:13.940
on all world life,

86
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.236
on the world itself, then we should put those dollars

87
00:04:17.236 --> 00:04:20.913
in trying to investigate and understand what's going on.

88
00:04:21.698 --> 00:04:24.800
A lot of times, within the UFO field,

89
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.402
people will bring messages of doom and gloom.

90
00:04:28.251 --> 00:04:29.923
This scares people,

91
00:04:29.923 --> 00:04:32.243
and it's the wrong thing to do.

92
00:04:32.243 --> 00:04:36.705
What I want to do is breathe

93
00:04:36.705 --> 00:04:39.197
a breath of fresh air into the subject.

94
00:04:39.197 --> 00:04:41.641
What I want my message to be is,

95
00:04:41.641 --> 00:04:46.253
of hope and prosperity,

96
00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:48.685
and a brighter future.

97
00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.134
And I don't think we have anything to fear

98
00:04:51.134 --> 00:04:52.777
from open contact.

99
00:04:52.777 --> 00:04:55.805
The only thing we have to fear is ourselves.

100
00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:59.747
<v Interviewer>One argument there is that,</v>

101
00:04:59.747 --> 00:05:02.775
if these advanced civilizations who some say have been here

102
00:05:02.775 --> 00:05:07.116
as long as we have, as humans, have always been here

103
00:05:07.116 --> 00:05:10.252
in various places inside the earth,

104
00:05:10.252 --> 00:05:13.068
phased off in frequencies just a tad,

105
00:05:13.068 --> 00:05:15.756
if they wanted to do something of an aggressive nature,

106
00:05:15.756 --> 00:05:17.463
they would've done so long ago.

107
00:05:17.463 --> 00:05:19.511
So on one hand,

108
00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:22.315
they're saying that we've been allowed to continue

109
00:05:22.315 --> 00:05:23.958
to develop relatively in peace.

110
00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.421
Then you hear the other side of the agenda, which is,

111
00:05:26.421 --> 00:05:28.609
yes, except certain factions of them have indeed

112
00:05:28.609 --> 00:05:32.289
tried to control us through hidden and subtle means.

113
00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.325
Where do you fall in that whole mix?

114
00:05:34.325 --> 00:05:35.935
<v ->Well, let's look at it this way.</v>

115
00:05:37.733 --> 00:05:40.203
Not one person's shown me

116
00:05:40.203 --> 00:05:43.135
where there has been open aggression from our visitors.

117
00:05:44.347 --> 00:05:47.716
In each and every case where there has been aggression,

118
00:05:47.716 --> 00:05:52.223
it's been initiated by our own kind.

119
00:05:52.223 --> 00:05:56.446
The Soviet Union has lost better than three dozen aircraft

120
00:05:56.446 --> 00:05:58.719
trying to shoot UFOs down

121
00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:01.748
just because they were UFOs that violated their airspace.

122
00:06:01.748 --> 00:06:04.830
They knew they were exhibiting advanced technologies.

123
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.700
I also feel that the powers that be knew that they were

124
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.568
not of this world, but they were hoping to shoot it down

125
00:06:10.568 --> 00:06:13.673
regardless of loss of life, in order to acquire

126
00:06:13.673 --> 00:06:15.624
the technology involved.

127
00:06:15.624 --> 00:06:20.360
The other cases, a good one is 1955, Hop--

128
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.511
I can't say it,

129
00:06:21.511 --> 00:06:23.751
Hopkinsville, Kentucky.

130
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:28.571
A farm family there was confronted by little creatures,

131
00:06:28.571 --> 00:06:30.822
about 3, 3 and a half foot tall.

132
00:06:30.822 --> 00:06:34.304
They immediately got guns and started to shoot at 'em.

133
00:06:34.304 --> 00:06:35.776
<v Interviewer>That's the American way.</v>

134
00:06:35.776 --> 00:06:37.503
<v ->Well, that's the human way.</v>

135
00:06:37.503 --> 00:06:39.327
<v Interviewer>I know, I know. It's true.</v>

136
00:06:39.327 --> 00:06:40.809
It's very sad.

137
00:06:42.549 --> 00:06:44.856
<v ->We respond with fear</v>

138
00:06:44.856 --> 00:06:46.882
at anything that is unknown.

139
00:06:48.042 --> 00:06:50.926
If we have that fear,

140
00:06:50.926 --> 00:06:54.244
then our conduct towards

141
00:06:54.244 --> 00:06:56.354
that of the uknown

142
00:06:56.354 --> 00:06:58.742
has always been with hostility.

143
00:06:58.742 --> 00:07:01.002
What we need to do is get to the point

144
00:07:01.002 --> 00:07:04.491
where we overcome our fear of the unknown,

145
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:08.830
face it head on, and try to understand,

146
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.260
logically,

147
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.028
why that unknown stimulus is occurring.

148
00:07:14.028 --> 00:07:15.639
For example,

149
00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:19.458
I personally believe, I personally know,

150
00:07:19.458 --> 00:07:23.006
their agenda here is purely scientific.

151
00:07:23.006 --> 00:07:24.788
It's not for world conquest.

152
00:07:25.903 --> 00:07:28.773
Should it be for world conquest,

153
00:07:28.773 --> 00:07:32.012
they could've took us over many millennia ago,

154
00:07:32.012 --> 00:07:35.873
and we would be worshiping them today as gods.

155
00:07:35.873 --> 00:07:39.304
If you were to go face to face with an ET,

156
00:07:39.304 --> 00:07:41.778
they would tell you

157
00:07:41.778 --> 00:07:45.597
that they are not gods, they are as mortal as you and I.

158
00:07:45.597 --> 00:07:50.597
Now, their lifespan is much longer than that of ours,

159
00:07:50.597 --> 00:07:53.471
but here again, we someday will achieve that also.

160
00:07:54.478 --> 00:07:56.975
Now, they're not here to interfere

161
00:07:56.975 --> 00:07:58.767
with our growth.

162
00:07:58.767 --> 00:08:02.809
I don't like the term evolutionary growth

163
00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:06.873
because I believe in God, but if God chose to have us

164
00:08:06.873 --> 00:08:09.902
come about as a result of evolution, so be it.

165
00:08:09.902 --> 00:08:12.153
That doesn't take God out of the equation.

166
00:08:12.153 --> 00:08:15.224
It just explains how God did his handy work.

167
00:08:15.224 --> 00:08:17.444
Science and God goes hand in hand.

168
00:08:18.656 --> 00:08:21.931
On a personal level, which I really don't want to go into,

169
00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:26.577
I was afraid to ask how they felt about God.

170
00:08:26.577 --> 00:08:29.339
Personal tragedy went ahead and made it

171
00:08:29.339 --> 00:08:30.583
to where I did ask.

172
00:08:31.812 --> 00:08:34.384
They were shocked that I never did ask before.

173
00:08:34.384 --> 00:08:35.958
<v Interviewer>When you say "they," to clarify</v>

174
00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:36.683
who they are.

175
00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:38.837
<v ->They being our visitors.
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

176
00:08:40.165 --> 00:08:42.448
<v ->I was always afraid to ask.</v>

177
00:08:42.448 --> 00:08:44.783
And when they said, "Why haven't you asked this before?"

178
00:08:44.783 --> 00:08:46.874
I said, "I was afraid to ask

179
00:08:46.874 --> 00:08:49.772
"because I was afraid of the answer I'd get."

180
00:08:49.772 --> 00:08:52.215
It involved the death of my son,

181
00:08:52.215 --> 00:08:54.199
so you know, I thought, "Darn,

182
00:08:54.199 --> 00:08:58.408
"if there's no life after this life, what a terrible joke.

183
00:08:58.408 --> 00:09:00.527
"Life has no purpose."

184
00:09:00.527 --> 00:09:04.473
If you take God out of the equation, life has no purpose.

185
00:09:04.473 --> 00:09:06.605
We're nothing more than ameobas

186
00:09:06.605 --> 00:09:09.773
infecting this rock called planet Earth.

187
00:09:09.773 --> 00:09:11.438
But we're much more than that.

188
00:09:11.438 --> 00:09:13.026
<v Interviewer>And what was their answer?</v>

189
00:09:13.026 --> 00:09:15.256
<v ->Their answer was, "We can't tell you</v>

190
00:09:15.256 --> 00:09:17.943
"what religion is true and correct,

191
00:09:17.943 --> 00:09:20.237
"for religions are made by men,

192
00:09:20.237 --> 00:09:23.692
"even within our own society," meaning theirs.

193
00:09:23.692 --> 00:09:25.532
"All we can do is tell you

194
00:09:26.712 --> 00:09:29.145
"that we accept life after death

195
00:09:29.145 --> 00:09:31.298
"from a scientific perspective,

196
00:09:31.298 --> 00:09:33.657
"because our science has proved it.

197
00:09:33.657 --> 00:09:36.898
"Your science is closely approaching that threshold.

198
00:09:36.898 --> 00:09:40.643
"You will some day learn that which you call God exists.

199
00:09:40.643 --> 00:09:43.992
"But we can't tell you who or what God is."

200
00:09:46.409 --> 00:09:50.066
<v Interviewer>Now, obviously that set you at ease</v>

201
00:09:50.066 --> 00:09:53.513
and was profound in your life.

202
00:09:53.513 --> 00:09:56.990
<v ->You know, I wish I could tell you the rest of the story.</v>

203
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.397
<v Interviewer>I wish you could too.</v>

204
00:09:58.397 --> 00:10:02.762
<v ->Because they arranged for me to see,</v>

205
00:10:05.701 --> 00:10:06.758
forgive me.

206
00:10:08.278 --> 00:10:11.994
They arranged for me to see my son twice.

207
00:10:11.994 --> 00:10:13.166
And that was.

208
00:10:14.709 --> 00:10:18.494
But it gets kind of weird.

209
00:10:19.464 --> 00:10:21.567
<v Interviewer>Weird's okay.</v>

210
00:10:21.567 --> 00:10:24.289
Maybe we'll continue on a bit,

211
00:10:24.289 --> 00:10:27.164
and then if you feel comfortable enough talking about weird,

212
00:10:27.164 --> 00:10:30.491
we have a very open minded audience watching this.

213
00:10:32.241 --> 00:10:34.172
So shall we? I'll go ahead

214
00:10:34.172 --> 00:10:37.827
and prod you over toward Disclosure a bit,

215
00:10:37.827 --> 00:10:39.629
and then maybe we can come back to this.

216
00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:42.184
Unless you want to take it now. It's your choice, Clifford.

217
00:10:44.472 --> 00:10:47.635
<v ->There was one time I went to California.</v>

218
00:10:47.635 --> 00:10:49.507
Forgive me for getting emotional, but I can't help that.

219
00:10:49.507 --> 00:10:51.658
<v Interviewer>It's your son, of course.</v>

220
00:10:54.703 --> 00:10:55.796
<v ->Even to this day,</v>

221
00:10:56.974 --> 00:10:58.798
we go and visit my son's grave.

222
00:11:00.478 --> 00:11:03.159
Every day. If we don't, we feel guilty.

223
00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:05.558
You know? I feel guilty even here,

224
00:11:05.558 --> 00:11:07.724
I haven't visited his grave for three days.

225
00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:11.325
Anyhow, when we got back from California,

226
00:11:11.325 --> 00:11:14.381
we went to visit his grave.

227
00:11:15.549 --> 00:11:16.751
When we went there,

228
00:11:18.751 --> 00:11:21.745
we stayed for a little while, then went ahead,

229
00:11:21.745 --> 00:11:22.908
left, went home.

230
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.645
That night, I couldn't sleep.

231
00:11:26.963 --> 00:11:29.950
And I was calling on my little friend,

232
00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.584
the one that I have contact with a lot.

233
00:11:32.584 --> 00:11:34.856
I don't just go and call him up like,

234
00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:41.572
old TV sitcom about it being

235
00:11:41.572 --> 00:11:44.398
My Uncle's a Martian or something like that.

236
00:11:44.398 --> 00:11:46.062
My Favorite Martian, I believe it was.

237
00:11:46.062 --> 00:11:47.924
<v Interviewer>My Favorite Martian.</v>

238
00:11:47.924 --> 00:11:51.093
<v ->He said, "We have arranged for you to see your son.</v>

239
00:11:51.093 --> 00:11:54.620
"What you say on this side of the veil,

240
00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.606
"what you say on what you call this side of the veil,

241
00:11:59.516 --> 00:12:01.029
"you'll be able to remember.

242
00:12:01.029 --> 00:12:03.864
"On the other side of the veil, you won't remember nothing."

243
00:12:04.796 --> 00:12:08.232
So it was like I met my son,

244
00:12:08.232 --> 00:12:10.280
some transformation took place.

245
00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.232
I can't explain that.

246
00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:15.357
But when it took place, was standing,

247
00:12:15.357 --> 00:12:16.559
I saw my son.

248
00:12:17.748 --> 00:12:21.528
And I went ahead and said,

249
00:12:22.598 --> 00:12:23.661
you know, "I love you,"

250
00:12:23.661 --> 00:12:25.880
and he said, "I love you too, Dad."

251
00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.304
And we went through this, like, a dark area,

252
00:12:30.783 --> 00:12:33.917
and that's all I remember 'til we came back through.

253
00:12:33.917 --> 00:12:38.078
When we came back through, he said, "I have to go now."

254
00:12:38.078 --> 00:12:39.971
And I said, "I understand."

255
00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:42.998
And he was telling me not to worry.

256
00:12:45.955 --> 00:12:47.861
<v Interviewer>And this was a gift?</v>

257
00:12:47.861 --> 00:12:48.842
And what?

258
00:12:48.842 --> 00:12:50.624
<v ->In Heaven, you don't just play harps.</v>

259
00:12:50.624 --> 00:12:51.722
<v Interviewer>Yeah.</v>

260
00:12:51.722 --> 00:12:54.325
<v ->But then, he went ahead,</v>

261
00:12:54.325 --> 00:12:57.023
and said he had to go.

262
00:12:57.023 --> 00:12:58.346
I said, "Yeah."

263
00:12:58.346 --> 00:13:00.458
We hugged one another and I said, "I love you, son."

264
00:13:00.458 --> 00:13:02.570
He says, "I love you too, Dad."

265
00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.297
Then he went back through the veil.

266
00:13:04.297 --> 00:13:06.132
Then everything was back in the bedroom,

267
00:13:07.184 --> 00:13:08.352
and I was sitting up in bed.

268
00:13:08.352 --> 00:13:11.009
I looked at the clock, it was 3:42.

269
00:13:12.103 --> 00:13:15.996
Then, all of a sudden, there's a strange, like,

270
00:13:15.996 --> 00:13:20.059
a yellow, greenish globe floating into the room.

271
00:13:21.495 --> 00:13:24.557
Then it took on what you'd say is a smiley face

272
00:13:24.557 --> 00:13:26.014
and immediately turned sinister.

273
00:13:27.215 --> 00:13:30.117
Then a real harsh, evil voice came on that said,

274
00:13:30.117 --> 00:13:31.127
"We could kill you."

275
00:13:32.243 --> 00:13:34.899
Then there was a softer voice that said,

276
00:13:34.899 --> 00:13:37.607
"No harm shall come to this person."

277
00:13:37.607 --> 00:13:41.262
Then immediately, that globe, it was like it was melting,

278
00:13:42.312 --> 00:13:44.148
and you could see drops falling to the ground,

279
00:13:44.148 --> 00:13:46.990
but there was nothing there, nothing to hit the ground.

280
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.492
Then the voice said, "Sleep."

281
00:13:49.492 --> 00:13:53.215
For the first time in six, seven months,

282
00:13:54.299 --> 00:13:57.980
I got a good night's sleep, about 12, 14 hours.

283
00:13:59.595 --> 00:14:02.156
When I woke up, I thought I was late for work

284
00:14:02.156 --> 00:14:06.774
'cause I thought it was morning as opposed to being evening.

285
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.673
<v Interviewer>Clifford, what do you make</v>

286
00:14:10.673 --> 00:14:13.819
of those conflicting voices that came in as well?

287
00:14:13.819 --> 00:14:15.686
Because, it's been known

288
00:14:15.686 --> 00:14:19.046
that you have been able to see, and hear, and experience

289
00:14:19.046 --> 00:14:21.499
into other, shall we say, subdimensional fields

290
00:14:21.499 --> 00:14:23.611
for a long time, this was discovered about you

291
00:14:23.611 --> 00:14:24.998
a long time ago.

292
00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:27.003
What do you make of those two conflicting forces

293
00:14:27.003 --> 00:14:28.346
that were there that night?

294
00:14:28.346 --> 00:14:29.657
<v ->I have no idea.</v>

295
00:14:31.317 --> 00:14:33.412
It's haunted me for some time.

296
00:14:33.412 --> 00:14:34.899
I have no answer for that.

297
00:14:34.899 --> 00:14:36.379
<v Interviewer>Like something tried to make</v>

298
00:14:36.379 --> 00:14:38.638
a little play, and they were basically shut out,

299
00:14:38.638 --> 00:14:40.100
and you were protected.

300
00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.135
<v ->Oh, I was definitely protected.</v>

301
00:14:43.834 --> 00:14:47.233
<v Interviewer>So your experience of the visitors has been,</v>

302
00:14:47.233 --> 00:14:51.038
on a personal level, 100 percent positive?

303
00:14:51.038 --> 00:14:52.338
<v ->Oh, yes.</v>

304
00:14:55.948 --> 00:14:57.109
As a child,

305
00:14:58.923 --> 00:15:00.178
and I saw them as children.

306
00:15:00.178 --> 00:15:03.763
I didn't see 'em as little grays or anything like that.

307
00:15:05.123 --> 00:15:08.557
The one I was closest to has a greenish tint to its skin.

308
00:15:08.557 --> 00:15:09.989
I wish I could say it was gray.

309
00:15:09.989 --> 00:15:11.336
Everybody says, "Well, if you said gray,

310
00:15:11.336 --> 00:15:12.803
I could believe your story more."

311
00:15:12.803 --> 00:15:15.283
'Cause really, there aren't that many green that show up.

312
00:15:16.194 --> 00:15:19.028
Well, I wish I could say it was gray.

313
00:15:19.028 --> 00:15:22.197
And if I just wanted to make it up, I'd make it gray.

314
00:15:22.197 --> 00:15:26.139
But the whole situation is, how do you change fact?

315
00:15:26.139 --> 00:15:27.407
<v Interviewer>How do you change your</v>

316
00:15:27.407 --> 00:15:28.528
experience?
<v Clifford>Do you want to</v>

317
00:15:28.528 --> 00:15:30.874
know the truth, or do you want a believable story?

318
00:15:31.974 --> 00:15:35.475
<v Interviewer>I first became aware of your story</v>

319
00:15:35.475 --> 00:15:37.831
through the Disclosure Project, because I was there.

320
00:15:37.831 --> 00:15:39.475
So were you, and that's when I met you,

321
00:15:39.475 --> 00:15:41.811
and that's been about seven years ago now.

322
00:15:44.841 --> 00:15:46.250
I wanna backtrack for just one moment

323
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.256
and then continue down the line we were just on.

324
00:15:49.436 --> 00:15:52.294
The other day, in one of the conferences,

325
00:15:52.294 --> 00:15:56.068
it may have been Bob Dean's again, it was one of them,

326
00:15:56.068 --> 00:15:57.965
they were saying that,

327
00:15:57.965 --> 00:16:00.281
no, John Alexander,

328
00:16:00.281 --> 00:16:04.910
he was saying that the Disclosure Project itself

329
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:08.835
was so abhorrent to those in the military

330
00:16:08.835 --> 00:16:12.515
and in Congress in the know, that it actually pushed

331
00:16:12.515 --> 00:16:15.108
any kind of disclosure

332
00:16:15.108 --> 00:16:17.778
from the government further back.

333
00:16:17.778 --> 00:16:19.395
What do you know about that?

334
00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:20.803
Is there truth in that?

335
00:16:22.131 --> 00:16:24.842
<v ->We actually met with members of Congress.</v>

336
00:16:25.744 --> 00:16:29.604
My friend that you met sat in one congressman's office

337
00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:32.949
where I finally just

338
00:16:34.384 --> 00:16:35.953
expressed myself.

339
00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:38.780
I said, "Look, sir. I've been there.

340
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.052
"I have seen our visitors.

341
00:16:41.052 --> 00:16:43.781
"I have been there when we did recoveries.

342
00:16:43.781 --> 00:16:46.265
"And the whole situation is,

343
00:16:46.265 --> 00:16:49.475
"people know this to be true, the documents exist."

344
00:16:49.475 --> 00:16:51.896
I named the programs for him.

345
00:16:51.896 --> 00:16:54.256
He pulled a file and showed it to us.

346
00:16:55.216 --> 00:16:57.700
Then he said, "Right now, there's nothing I can do.

347
00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.403
"It would be political suicide."

348
00:17:00.434 --> 00:17:02.562
He wished us success.

349
00:17:02.562 --> 00:17:06.915
He indicated as, he did there, and a couple others later on,

350
00:17:06.915 --> 00:17:10.147
that they did in fact believe there was something going on.

351
00:17:11.625 --> 00:17:13.914
But they were not willing to jeopardize

352
00:17:13.914 --> 00:17:16.139
their political interest

353
00:17:16.139 --> 00:17:19.799
in order to go ahead and try to get something put forward.

354
00:17:21.543 --> 00:17:24.423
And that's the way it's been throughout the years.

355
00:17:24.423 --> 00:17:26.493
<v Interviewer>Throughout self interest always winning out</v>

356
00:17:26.493 --> 00:17:28.358
because of fear of ridicule.

357
00:17:28.358 --> 00:17:31.090
Fear of ridicule means fear of losing budgets.

358
00:17:32.121 --> 00:17:35.949
Amazing it's that mundane, but that's a person's livelihood.

359
00:17:35.949 --> 00:17:37.143
We can understand.

360
00:17:37.143 --> 00:17:38.595
<v ->Oh, absolutely.</v>

361
00:17:38.595 --> 00:17:41.949
But here again, I'm gonna go ahead.

362
00:17:43.721 --> 00:17:45.973
When you go in the military, you take an oath.

363
00:17:47.163 --> 00:17:50.213
Defend the United States against all enemies,

364
00:17:50.213 --> 00:17:51.632
foreign and domestic.

365
00:17:53.558 --> 00:17:57.548
Now, for a long time, God forgive me for this,

366
00:17:57.548 --> 00:18:00.509
I actually negated my family.

367
00:18:00.509 --> 00:18:02.844
I wasn't there for a lot of things.

368
00:18:02.844 --> 00:18:04.553
I took that oath seriously.

369
00:18:05.583 --> 00:18:08.058
Now, my kids say there was never a lack of love,

370
00:18:09.215 --> 00:18:11.798
but there was a lot of lack of presence of Dad.

371
00:18:13.266 --> 00:18:16.246
This hit home real good when in,

372
00:18:17.703 --> 00:18:21.228
was 2003, I believe,

373
00:18:22.299 --> 00:18:24.455
we had a daughter in Vietnam,

374
00:18:24.455 --> 00:18:27.036
took us 30 years to get her out.

375
00:18:27.036 --> 00:18:30.321
When she got over here, I wanted to make sure

376
00:18:30.321 --> 00:18:32.636
that she didn't feel like she was just another person

377
00:18:32.636 --> 00:18:34.630
that we had to take care of.

378
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.553
I want her to know that her mother and I loved her,

379
00:18:37.553 --> 00:18:41.393
that we really, truly

380
00:18:41.393 --> 00:18:45.010
wanted to go ahead and get her over here.

381
00:18:46.242 --> 00:18:49.073
That she was part of the family.

382
00:18:50.327 --> 00:18:52.844
Now, you're not supposed to love one child

383
00:18:52.844 --> 00:18:56.279
more than the other, which, it's not the case,

384
00:18:56.279 --> 00:19:00.236
but my daughter and I became real, real close,

385
00:19:00.236 --> 00:19:01.872
as did her children.

386
00:19:03.894 --> 00:19:07.574
I can honestly say, my daughter, my grandkids there,

387
00:19:07.574 --> 00:19:09.729
those are the biggest part of my heart.

388
00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:15.426
When she got here, she wanted to fit in so much.

389
00:19:16.398 --> 00:19:18.525
Even told her kids that,

390
00:19:18.525 --> 00:19:20.480
"You can't ask grandpa to buy you anything."

391
00:19:21.424 --> 00:19:24.044
Well, grandpas wanna buy their grandkids things.

392
00:19:25.214 --> 00:19:28.222
Started off with my little one first,

393
00:19:28.222 --> 00:19:30.618
and I got real close to him.

394
00:19:30.618 --> 00:19:33.200
And I'm his grandpa,

395
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.095
he's not sharing his grandpa with no one.

396
00:19:35.095 --> 00:19:36.799
<v Interviewer>'Cause you don't want to go through</v>

397
00:19:36.799 --> 00:19:40.161
the mistakes, not even mistakes, the necessity of the past,

398
00:19:40.161 --> 00:19:44.397
to shut out your heart's joy for your career.

399
00:19:44.397 --> 00:19:45.867
And in your career,

400
00:19:48.197 --> 00:19:52.149
you must've had a fairly decent level clearance at one time.

401
00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:53.387
<v ->Oh, but you never knew it.</v>

402
00:19:54.438 --> 00:19:56.934
The only way I found out I even had a clearance

403
00:19:56.934 --> 00:20:00.592
is when I got into trouble for talking openly about UFOs.

404
00:20:00.592 --> 00:20:03.072
<v Interviewer>You didn't know you had a clearance?</v>

405
00:20:03.072 --> 00:20:04.876
I would think that would be quite uncommon.

406
00:20:04.876 --> 00:20:06.214
How can you know
<v Clifford>It is quite</v>

407
00:20:06.214 --> 00:20:07.251
uncommon.
<v Interviewer>not to</v>

408
00:20:07.251 --> 00:20:11.315
(laughs) break those strategic kinds of relationships

409
00:20:11.315 --> 00:20:12.958
if you don't even know you have clearance?

410
00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:15.509
<v ->You're always debriefed.</v>

411
00:20:15.509 --> 00:20:17.039
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

412
00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:18.204
But I was always scared.

413
00:20:18.204 --> 00:20:19.622
One time, I proudly announced

414
00:20:19.622 --> 00:20:21.393
I didn't have a security clearance.

415
00:20:21.393 --> 00:20:23.345
<v Interviewer>But you found out you did have one?</v>

416
00:20:23.345 --> 00:20:25.489
<v ->Oh, I did, but I didn't know that.</v>

417
00:20:26.924 --> 00:20:30.460
I went up and said, "This requires a top secret clearance.

418
00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.163
"I regret to say, I don't have a top secret clearance.

419
00:20:33.163 --> 00:20:34.967
"You're gonna have to get someone else."

420
00:20:34.967 --> 00:20:38.068
The colonel turned to me and said, "Sgt. Stone,

421
00:20:38.068 --> 00:20:40.135
"you would lay down your life for your country.

422
00:20:40.135 --> 00:20:41.597
"That's all the clearance I need.

423
00:20:42.488 --> 00:20:45.134
"You will do as I ask, you will do as we tell you."

424
00:20:46.366 --> 00:20:48.137
So I didn't get relieved, and I thought for sure,

425
00:20:48.137 --> 00:20:49.507
"Well, I'm going to nail 'em."

426
00:20:52.428 --> 00:20:54.854
<v Interviewer>Now let's go back to who you are.</v>

427
00:20:54.854 --> 00:20:56.771
Let's go back to your teenage years.

428
00:20:57.831 --> 00:20:59.623
What started there?

429
00:20:59.623 --> 00:21:01.241
<v ->Oh, it started long before teenage years.</v>

430
00:21:01.241 --> 00:21:02.881
<v Interviewer>I know.</v>

431
00:21:02.881 --> 00:21:04.867
Well okay, let's just go a little bit through childhood,

432
00:21:04.867 --> 00:21:06.562
and then talk about some of the events where

433
00:21:06.562 --> 00:21:08.606
you were contacted not by visitors,

434
00:21:08.606 --> 00:21:10.615
but by members of our government by the time

435
00:21:10.615 --> 00:21:12.404
you were in your teenage years.

436
00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:15.171
<v ->Well, when I was a child, a lot of things took place.</v>

437
00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.196
I had playmates that no one else could see,

438
00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:23.261
and I was told by them, "No one else can see us."

439
00:21:23.261 --> 00:21:25.480
It wouldn't be until I killed a little bird

440
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.880
trying to help him that I'd get to see

441
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.342
what they really looked like.

442
00:21:29.342 --> 00:21:32.446
That was the first time I saw the entity I call Korona

443
00:21:32.446 --> 00:21:33.929
up close and personal.

444
00:21:37.812 --> 00:21:40.099
There was an expression on his face,

445
00:21:40.099 --> 00:21:43.897
one of wonder, I mean,

446
00:21:43.897 --> 00:21:46.111
he didn't understand.

447
00:21:46.111 --> 00:21:48.260
And what he was telling me is,

448
00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:51.295
"Why do I feel what I'm feeling?"

449
00:21:52.271 --> 00:21:56.311
He meant, why do I feel what I'm feeling?

450
00:21:56.311 --> 00:21:59.009
Because he didn't understand why I was feeling

451
00:21:59.009 --> 00:22:01.366
what I was feeling over killing that little bird.

452
00:22:01.366 --> 00:22:02.779
But anything I felt,

453
00:22:04.419 --> 00:22:05.748
my entity felt.

454
00:22:06.778 --> 00:22:10.650
He knew exactly what I was feeling, what I was thinking,

455
00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:13.050
and this is a learning process for him.

456
00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:18.050
But once they attach to you for that learning process,

457
00:22:19.204 --> 00:22:20.581
they are there forever.

458
00:22:20.581 --> 00:22:21.594
They never leave.

459
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:26.131
So it's a lifelong process.

460
00:22:26.133 --> 00:22:28.974
So yes, I'll tell you right now, it's ongoing,

461
00:22:30.004 --> 00:22:32.456
but I don't pick or choose the time and place.

462
00:22:34.472 --> 00:22:37.783
The end result was, when I first saw my first UFO,

463
00:22:37.783 --> 00:22:40.770
that was in the summer of 1957,

464
00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:43.540
I was soon visited by a person who identified himself

465
00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.130
as a Captain Brown.

466
00:22:46.651 --> 00:22:49.002
Where I lived, on the corner of where I lived.

467
00:22:49.002 --> 00:22:51.900
<v Interviewer>This is in terrestrial form, Captain Brown?</v>

468
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:52.985
<v ->Yes.
<v Interviewer>Was a real</v>

469
00:22:52.985 --> 00:22:54.663
person?
<v ->Was a real person,</v>

470
00:22:54.663 --> 00:22:57.222
United States Air Force.

471
00:22:57.222 --> 00:23:00.412
There was a pharmacy

472
00:23:00.412 --> 00:23:02.555
known as Collin Drug Store.

473
00:23:04.299 --> 00:23:06.369
A book came out, a magazine,

474
00:23:06.369 --> 00:23:08.524
put out by True Magazine,

475
00:23:08.524 --> 00:23:12.214
and it was entitled "Facts about UFOs"

476
00:23:12.214 --> 00:23:13.462
or something like that.

477
00:23:13.462 --> 00:23:16.224
Anyhow, it was just about UFOs.

478
00:23:17.191 --> 00:23:20.776
Well, True Magazine is identified as a men's magazine,

479
00:23:20.776 --> 00:23:23.699
so being about eight years old, they were not gonna sell me

480
00:23:23.699 --> 00:23:27.048
that magazine, so Captain Brown came up behind me

481
00:23:27.048 --> 00:23:29.245
and says, "Oh, you have an interest in UFOs?

482
00:23:29.245 --> 00:23:30.483
"So do I."

483
00:23:31.459 --> 00:23:32.746
So he went ahead and says,

484
00:23:32.746 --> 00:23:34.737
"I'll take two of those magazines."

485
00:23:34.737 --> 00:23:36.614
So he got two of 'em,

486
00:23:36.614 --> 00:23:38.416
and of course I thought the guy was a jerk

487
00:23:38.416 --> 00:23:42.981
for not selling me one, but, you know, fine.

488
00:23:42.981 --> 00:23:46.174
I'll talk to my mom and dad, see if they'll pick me up one.

489
00:23:46.174 --> 00:23:48.201
Anyhow, he asked me if I liked root beer floats.

490
00:23:48.201 --> 00:23:51.528
Up to that time, I figured ice cream was good,

491
00:23:51.528 --> 00:23:55.315
root beer was good, but never in the same glass.

492
00:23:55.315 --> 00:23:57.971
Anyhow, he said, "Well, let's get us two root beer floats,

493
00:23:57.971 --> 00:24:00.104
"and if you don't like it, you don't have to drink it

494
00:24:00.104 --> 00:24:01.608
"or eat it."

495
00:24:01.608 --> 00:24:03.900
So I went ahead, got it,

496
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.962
and I found out I like root beer floats that day.

497
00:24:06.962 --> 00:24:09.575
Anyhow, went ahead, he said,

498
00:24:09.575 --> 00:24:11.506
"Understand you saw something strange here

499
00:24:11.506 --> 00:24:13.114
"a couple days back."

500
00:24:13.114 --> 00:24:14.481
<v Interviewer>Now how did he know that?</v>

501
00:24:14.481 --> 00:24:15.672
<v ->I have no idea.</v>

502
00:24:16.766 --> 00:24:18.468
And I said, "Yes, sir, I did."

503
00:24:18.468 --> 00:24:22.062
But I felt proud, and I had a big head at that time,

504
00:24:22.062 --> 00:24:24.889
'cause I had a captain from the US Air Force

505
00:24:24.889 --> 00:24:28.553
taking me seriously when all this other time, people wasn't.

506
00:24:29.472 --> 00:24:31.378
So I told him what I saw.

507
00:24:31.378 --> 00:24:32.745
<v Interviewer>Did you tell other people</v>

508
00:24:32.745 --> 00:24:34.290
after you had seen it? Like your family?

509
00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:35.559
<v ->Oh, yes.
<v Interviewer>Yeah, I bet.</v>

510
00:24:35.559 --> 00:24:38.386
<v ->Well the whole situation is, you felt like you had</v>

511
00:24:38.386 --> 00:24:41.147
an experience you needed to share with the world.

512
00:24:41.147 --> 00:24:43.366
Up to that time, I didn't believe in UFOs.

513
00:24:43.366 --> 00:24:44.849
<v Interviewer>And you were how old again?</v>

514
00:24:44.849 --> 00:24:45.982
<v ->I was eight years old.</v>

515
00:24:45.982 --> 00:24:47.152
<v Interviewer>There you go, okay.</v>

516
00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:50.517
<v ->UFOs didn't exist, they were things that</v>

517
00:24:50.517 --> 00:24:52.668
were of the sci-fi world.

518
00:24:52.668 --> 00:24:54.394
They weren't reality.

519
00:24:54.394 --> 00:24:56.574
Now I knew everything that I believed,

520
00:24:57.714 --> 00:25:00.431
I had to look at it in a different perspective now.

521
00:25:00.431 --> 00:25:02.264
<v Interviewer>Fortunately, you were pliable enough</v>

522
00:25:02.264 --> 00:25:04.495
and young enough that it wasn't a big stretch.

523
00:25:05.505 --> 00:25:06.904
<v ->Oh, it had an impact.</v>

524
00:25:09.287 --> 00:25:11.368
But I'd seen enough sci-fi movies.

525
00:25:11.368 --> 00:25:13.171
I knew how we could deal with them.

526
00:25:13.171 --> 00:25:14.446
(interviewer laughs)

527
00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:16.442
<v Interviewer>So now you're talking with,</v>

528
00:25:16.442 --> 00:25:17.654
did you say Colonel Brown?

529
00:25:17.654 --> 00:25:19.602
<v ->No, Captain Brown.</v>

530
00:25:19.602 --> 00:25:21.734
But he goes home with me.

531
00:25:21.734 --> 00:25:24.039
My dad's working, he talks to my mom.

532
00:25:25.279 --> 00:25:27.353
Then my dad gets home,

533
00:25:27.353 --> 00:25:29.722
and when my mom and dad are there,

534
00:25:29.722 --> 00:25:31.855
he tells my mom and dad, "Look,

535
00:25:31.855 --> 00:25:35.044
"we believe that your son has seen something

536
00:25:35.044 --> 00:25:37.848
"or had some experiences which we'd prefer

537
00:25:37.848 --> 00:25:39.886
"the whole world not know,

538
00:25:39.886 --> 00:25:42.041
"but I'd like to have permission to just talk to him

539
00:25:42.041 --> 00:25:44.068
"from time to time."

540
00:25:44.068 --> 00:25:47.257
And he went ahead, gave the name of his superior,

541
00:25:49.204 --> 00:25:51.337
what the purpose of it was,

542
00:25:51.337 --> 00:25:52.889
and even named Project Blue Book,

543
00:25:52.889 --> 00:25:56.186
which Project Blue Book had nothing to do with it.

544
00:25:56.186 --> 00:25:57.314
But he went ahead, said,

545
00:25:57.314 --> 00:26:00.609
"We'd just like to talk to him from time to time."

546
00:26:00.609 --> 00:26:03.468
And he says, "I'll be the only one coming to have contact.

547
00:26:03.468 --> 00:26:06.750
"From time to time, I may bring another person,

548
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:11.012
"but we need your permission because he's a child."

549
00:26:11.012 --> 00:26:14.765
First, they were hesitant, and they said, "Well, okay."

550
00:26:14.765 --> 00:26:17.475
So, from time to time, he'd come and visit me.

551
00:26:17.475 --> 00:26:19.705
We'd talk about many things.

552
00:26:19.705 --> 00:26:21.369
He even started to talk about my friends,

553
00:26:21.369 --> 00:26:25.070
and I was wondering, "How do you know about my friends?"

554
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:28.344
He says, "Well, we have heard of such things before."

555
00:26:28.344 --> 00:26:30.519
I said, "Well, you know, you can't see them."

556
00:26:31.509 --> 00:26:35.196
And he says, "Well, I've seen a lot of things in my life."

557
00:26:35.196 --> 00:26:38.726
Anyhow, in '68, when I first tried to go into the military,

558
00:26:38.726 --> 00:26:41.955
I called and told him that I was enlisting in the Army,

559
00:26:41.955 --> 00:26:46.243
and at that time, I found out he was supposedly killed

560
00:26:46.243 --> 00:26:48.144
in a crash in a T-38.

561
00:26:50.293 --> 00:26:53.485
Went, tried to get into the Army, I was medically rejected,

562
00:26:53.485 --> 00:26:54.952
didn't get in.

563
00:26:54.952 --> 00:26:58.139
That was in February of '68.

564
00:26:58.139 --> 00:27:02.075
In late June,

565
00:27:02.075 --> 00:27:04.208
I was called back 'cause they had the draft,

566
00:27:04.208 --> 00:27:07.429
and every so often you had to go back to be reevaluated.

567
00:27:07.429 --> 00:27:09.669
I knew I wasn't getting in,

568
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:13.135
but when I got to the AFEE station,

569
00:27:13.135 --> 00:27:16.612
the Armed Forces Entrance Examination station,

570
00:27:16.612 --> 00:27:19.503
I went in, once again, medically rejected,

571
00:27:19.503 --> 00:27:22.116
but there was this doctor, a colonel,

572
00:27:22.116 --> 00:27:24.760
visiting from Washington, D.C.

573
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.021
there at the Ashland AFEE station.

574
00:27:29.639 --> 00:27:31.508
The captain told me, says, "Well,

575
00:27:31.508 --> 00:27:33.136
"I'll get you in here shortly,

576
00:27:33.136 --> 00:27:35.471
"we'll go over your medical results."

577
00:27:35.471 --> 00:27:37.264
Says, "But you're going home."

578
00:27:37.264 --> 00:27:38.963
The colonel steps up and tells the captain,

579
00:27:38.963 --> 00:27:40.430
"You can take the rest of the afternoon off,

580
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:41.502
"I'll finish these up."

581
00:27:42.502 --> 00:27:44.861
He called me in next,

582
00:27:44.861 --> 00:27:47.794
bypassed two or three others and called me in,

583
00:27:47.794 --> 00:27:50.994
talked to me about how patriotic I was,

584
00:27:50.994 --> 00:27:53.170
did I really want to go,

585
00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:56.286
was it just a facade, was I happy that I wasn't going?

586
00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:01.785
These were the days that you had your heroes

587
00:28:01.785 --> 00:28:03.790
like John Wayne,

588
00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.270
Hoppalong Cassidy, and this guy was calling me a coward.

589
00:28:09.343 --> 00:28:11.184
Coward I wasn't.

590
00:28:11.184 --> 00:28:13.543
So I said, "If I could get in, I'd go."

591
00:28:14.754 --> 00:28:16.141
And he says, "I'm gonna get you in.

592
00:28:16.141 --> 00:28:18.626
"Remember, any time you don't want to be there,

593
00:28:18.626 --> 00:28:20.535
"just bring up your medical condition, you're out."

594
00:28:20.535 --> 00:28:22.001
I said, "Get me in, I won't get out."

595
00:28:23.161 --> 00:28:25.123
So I got in,

596
00:28:26.239 --> 00:28:29.673
and then there was trials and tribulations to see,

597
00:28:29.673 --> 00:28:33.320
physically, whether I would really do that.

598
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.816
I had my hands tore up to where they were to the bone.

599
00:28:36.816 --> 00:28:40.133
The intent was, that happening,

600
00:28:41.855 --> 00:28:44.853
people who did that, that was a crime.

601
00:28:44.853 --> 00:28:48.178
Well, would I be loyal enough

602
00:28:48.178 --> 00:28:50.726
to go ahead and cover it up?

603
00:28:50.726 --> 00:28:54.908
Or would I be angry enough to expose the ones

604
00:28:54.908 --> 00:28:56.757
that did it, and get 'em court marshaled?

605
00:28:57.851 --> 00:29:00.269
Well, I was loyal enough to cover it up.

606
00:29:00.269 --> 00:29:02.294
I would not tell the truth, how it happened.

607
00:29:03.494 --> 00:29:05.376
Even CID came over and asked,

608
00:29:06.672 --> 00:29:08.272
and I told 'em I was just overzealous

609
00:29:08.272 --> 00:29:10.991
and trying to get to where I could do better

610
00:29:10.991 --> 00:29:13.328
on the horizontal ladder.

611
00:29:13.328 --> 00:29:16.639
Two guys, next day, on a Saturday,

612
00:29:20.299 --> 00:29:22.378
we had a little discussion,

613
00:29:22.378 --> 00:29:25.972
and they decided that, if I would go ahead

614
00:29:25.972 --> 00:29:28.490
and enlist for three more years,

615
00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:32.126
and when I was needed, help them from time to time,

616
00:29:32.126 --> 00:29:34.409
after all, the truth was coming out at the end of the year,

617
00:29:34.409 --> 00:29:36.734
which was 1969.

618
00:29:36.734 --> 00:29:37.993
<v Interviewer>The truth about what?</v>

619
00:29:37.993 --> 00:29:40.062
<v ->The truth about unidentified flying objects,</v>

620
00:29:40.062 --> 00:29:41.944
that they were going to be interplanetary.

621
00:29:41.944 --> 00:29:42.912
<v Interviewer>And they were</v>

622
00:29:42.912 --> 00:29:44.421
going to share this with the public at large?

623
00:29:44.421 --> 00:29:48.527
<v ->That was supposed to be coming out by the end of 1969.</v>

624
00:29:48.527 --> 00:29:50.296
<v Interviewer>So the fact that you had a little bit</v>

625
00:29:50.296 --> 00:29:52.171
of advanced knowledge, they might as well utilize you

626
00:29:52.171 --> 00:29:53.163
in some capacity?

627
00:29:53.163 --> 00:29:55.530
<v ->And they were gonna utilize me in some capacity.</v>

628
00:29:56.488 --> 00:29:58.485
<v Interviewer>Did they know that you had friends?</v>

629
00:29:58.485 --> 00:30:00.022
<v ->Yes.</v>

630
00:30:00.022 --> 00:30:02.213
They knew a whole lot about my life.

631
00:30:02.213 --> 00:30:04.245
<v Interviewer>So they knew more than you would've actually</v>

632
00:30:04.245 --> 00:30:05.652
shared with them
<v Clifford>I just didn't</v>

633
00:30:05.652 --> 00:30:07.398
know what what they were gonna do with that.

634
00:30:07.398 --> 00:30:08.588
I was to learn later.

635
00:30:08.588 --> 00:30:10.603
<v Interviewer>Let's cut right to what they ended up</v>

636
00:30:10.603 --> 00:30:11.913
doing with that.

637
00:30:11.913 --> 00:30:14.419
<v ->They went ahead and got me involved where,</v>

638
00:30:14.419 --> 00:30:17.448
when I was needed, they would call me up,

639
00:30:17.448 --> 00:30:19.770
then I'd be obliged to go.

640
00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.436
I'd get a knock at the door sometimes.

641
00:30:22.436 --> 00:30:25.156
Code word would be "Tobasco."

642
00:30:25.156 --> 00:30:27.448
I had a BA-50 bag.

643
00:30:27.448 --> 00:30:30.788
It had the change of uniforms, it had a .45 in there,

644
00:30:30.788 --> 00:30:33.369
and it had the equipment that I needed.

645
00:30:33.369 --> 00:30:35.746
I would grab that BA-50 bag,

646
00:30:35.746 --> 00:30:38.200
I would go out in the waiting staff car,

647
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.733
go to wherever I was needed, a lot of times a staging area

648
00:30:41.733 --> 00:30:44.079
close by, sometimes you'd have to get on a plane.

649
00:30:44.989 --> 00:30:47.344
You'd kiss the wife and kids good-bye,

650
00:30:47.344 --> 00:30:48.967
you didn't know if you'd ever see 'em again.

651
00:30:50.019 --> 00:30:52.738
But everybody was exposed to the same thing.

652
00:30:52.738 --> 00:30:54.482
<v Interviewer>And when they took you</v>

653
00:30:54.482 --> 00:30:56.968
to the staging ground or wherever you were taken,

654
00:30:56.968 --> 00:30:59.849
what was the purpose of your being there?

655
00:30:59.849 --> 00:31:03.368
<v ->You were going out to a site either to recover</v>

656
00:31:03.368 --> 00:31:06.963
debris of a UFO,

657
00:31:06.963 --> 00:31:09.843
to recover a craft that has crashed.

658
00:31:09.843 --> 00:31:12.917
My job was to do interfacing

659
00:31:12.917 --> 00:31:15.075
if they had any survivors.

660
00:31:15.075 --> 00:31:16.549
<v Interviewer>Because they knew of</v>

661
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:19.798
your friendships with visitors from

662
00:31:19.798 --> 00:31:21.205
childhood?
<v Clifford>Right.</v>

663
00:31:21.205 --> 00:31:22.804
And so, this is telepathic communication

664
00:31:22.804 --> 00:31:25.584
we're talking about?
<v Clifford>Most of the times</v>

665
00:31:25.584 --> 00:31:27.427
and that's when it was needed.

666
00:31:27.427 --> 00:31:28.909
<v Interviewer>And did this occur,</v>

667
00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:31.768
where you actually did have telepathic interface

668
00:31:31.768 --> 00:31:35.182
with visitors upon demand?

669
00:31:36.137 --> 00:31:37.766
<v ->Oh, yeah.</v>

670
00:31:37.766 --> 00:31:39.366
The entities would initiate it.

671
00:31:40.533 --> 00:31:42.232
And sometimes, that'd be very emotional.

672
00:31:42.232 --> 00:31:43.703
<v Interviewer>Now, this is not something</v>

673
00:31:43.703 --> 00:31:44.556
that happened often.

674
00:31:44.556 --> 00:31:45.672
I heard you say in your talk that

675
00:31:45.672 --> 00:31:47.891
these kinds of crash sites, that these things

676
00:31:47.891 --> 00:31:50.920
don't happen often, but they did happen.

677
00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.338
<v ->Oh, yeah, they happen.</v>

678
00:31:52.338 --> 00:31:54.494
You had a real job in the military.

679
00:31:55.652 --> 00:32:00.463
And when these events happened, if you were in that area,

680
00:32:00.463 --> 00:32:02.083
then you were called up.

681
00:32:03.473 --> 00:32:06.807
There were people who, that was their sole purpose.

682
00:32:06.807 --> 00:32:08.194
And these people would show up,

683
00:32:08.194 --> 00:32:10.445
but they would be in total control.

684
00:32:10.445 --> 00:32:12.534
You had other people who didn't have a clue

685
00:32:12.534 --> 00:32:13.900
what was going on,

686
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.172
and those you felt sorry for,

687
00:32:16.172 --> 00:32:18.775
because a lot of them didn't know how to deal with it.

688
00:32:18.775 --> 00:32:20.523
<v Interviewer>So you were specifically utilized</v>

689
00:32:20.523 --> 00:32:22.997
by the crash retrieval,

690
00:32:22.997 --> 00:32:25.740
was a division of some kind dealing with crash retrievals,

691
00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:26.614
wasn't it?

692
00:32:26.614 --> 00:32:29.345
<v ->Well, the operations that did the recoveries.</v>

693
00:32:29.345 --> 00:32:30.848
<v Interviewer>Let's talk about interfacing</v>

694
00:32:30.848 --> 00:32:34.682
with the others a little bit.

695
00:32:36.266 --> 00:32:39.210
<v ->When you went ahead and you did the interfacing,</v>

696
00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:41.589
they'd go ahead, they'd talk directly to you.

697
00:32:41.589 --> 00:32:43.818
When they would talk directly to you,

698
00:32:44.928 --> 00:32:45.669
it'd be like,

699
00:32:46.987 --> 00:32:49.343
you were hearing it not only in your head,

700
00:32:49.343 --> 00:32:52.325
but in your ears also, but nobody else could hear it.

701
00:32:54.059 --> 00:32:56.364
The end result is,

702
00:32:57.393 --> 00:32:59.239
even more than that, you could feel the emotions

703
00:32:59.239 --> 00:33:00.381
they were feeling.

704
00:33:02.271 --> 00:33:04.447
I wanna rush through that because,

705
00:33:04.447 --> 00:33:06.921
sometimes you could feel the fear or the pain,

706
00:33:06.921 --> 00:33:11.006
you could feel the loss,

707
00:33:11.006 --> 00:33:13.328
you could feel their fear of never seeing

708
00:33:13.328 --> 00:33:15.563
their loved ones again.

709
00:33:15.563 --> 00:33:19.026
See, we see them as cartoon characters.

710
00:33:19.026 --> 00:33:21.079
They have societies, they have families.

711
00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:25.840
They are more human than what we give them credit for.

712
00:33:27.019 --> 00:33:29.216
I know that sounds crazy, but they are.

713
00:33:31.398 --> 00:33:34.005
If we look for the similarities in them and us,

714
00:33:34.897 --> 00:33:36.374
once that open,

715
00:33:39.246 --> 00:33:42.527
that open contact takes place,

716
00:33:42.527 --> 00:33:46.587
if we can look at the similarities between them and us,

717
00:33:46.587 --> 00:33:49.168
it will make that first contact much easier.

718
00:33:50.201 --> 00:33:51.617
<v Interviewer>Do you feel that that time</v>

719
00:33:51.617 --> 00:33:52.822
is actually nearing?

720
00:33:52.822 --> 00:33:53.810
<v ->Oh, yeah.</v>

721
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:55.396
Inevitably.

722
00:33:55.396 --> 00:33:57.369
<v Interviewer>What are the indications to you</v>

723
00:33:57.369 --> 00:34:00.867
that we are going to be seeing some kind of disclosure?

724
00:34:00.867 --> 00:34:04.014
<v ->Because there are things in and near our atmosphere</v>

725
00:34:04.014 --> 00:34:06.937
right now that we're never gonna be able to cover up

726
00:34:06.937 --> 00:34:08.846
in the near future.

727
00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:11.426
It's gonna be discovered by astronomers

728
00:34:11.426 --> 00:34:13.805
who have no ties with federal government

729
00:34:13.805 --> 00:34:15.555
or any other government,

730
00:34:15.555 --> 00:34:16.834
and these people are gonna want

731
00:34:16.834 --> 00:34:20.140
to make their findings known, not in the interest

732
00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:24.023
of any government or prestige,

733
00:34:24.023 --> 00:34:27.703
but to make it known in the interest of humanity.

734
00:34:27.703 --> 00:34:29.207
<v Interviewer>Are you sharing something</v>

735
00:34:29.207 --> 00:34:30.118
that you know to be true?

736
00:34:30.118 --> 00:34:31.557
You've gotten advanced
<v Clifford>Oh, yes.</v>

737
00:34:31.557 --> 00:34:33.518
knowledge on this, so there are going to be some events

738
00:34:33.518 --> 00:34:35.673
that are going to be occurring,

739
00:34:35.673 --> 00:34:38.392
and it's going to be out of the hands of the military,

740
00:34:38.392 --> 00:34:40.046
and out of the hands of Congress,

741
00:34:40.046 --> 00:34:41.582
and this is going to be made public?

742
00:34:41.582 --> 00:34:42.361
There's going to be

743
00:34:42.361 --> 00:34:43.850
a contact event?
<v ->It's going to be so plain</v>

744
00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:45.365
that an even amateur astronomers are gonna be

745
00:34:45.365 --> 00:34:46.435
picking up on it.

746
00:34:46.435 --> 00:34:48.164
<v Interviewer>How far off are we looking at?</v>

747
00:34:48.164 --> 00:34:50.041
<v ->I can't even</v>

748
00:34:50.041 --> 00:34:51.503
speculate.
<v ->Hard to tell what time.</v>

749
00:34:51.503 --> 00:34:53.473
<v ->But soon, very near.</v>

750
00:34:53.473 --> 00:34:55.141
<v Interviewer>And what does that mean for you?</v>

751
00:34:55.141 --> 00:34:56.613
After everything you've been through,

752
00:34:56.613 --> 00:34:58.278
what will that day mean for you?

753
00:34:59.678 --> 00:35:00.673
<v ->Peace.</v>

754
00:35:02.983 --> 00:35:04.263
<v Interviewer>Thank you, Clifford.</v>

755
00:35:04.263 --> 00:35:05.242
<v ->Thank you, ma'am.</v>

756
00:35:06.613 --> 00:35:08.223
<v ->Over the next few months, we'll be talking</v>

757
00:35:08.223 --> 00:35:10.718
with other former military personnel who were also

758
00:35:10.718 --> 00:35:14.078
privy to classified and confidential information

759
00:35:14.078 --> 00:35:16.351
regarding the presence of ETs on earth,

760
00:35:16.351 --> 00:35:19.252
a presence that is said to continue to this day.

761
00:35:19.252 --> 00:35:21.808
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

762
00:35:21.808 --> 00:35:26.808
(spacey music)
