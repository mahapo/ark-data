00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:01.980 align:middle line:84%
>>While Peter
Russell's background

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.540 align:middle line:84%
is in mathematics and
theoretical physics,

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.960 align:middle line:84%
it was unanswered questions
in both these arenas

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.320 align:middle line:84%
that dropped him onto his
path of enlightenment.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.740 align:middle line:84%
This took him to
India, where he studied

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.340 align:middle line:84%
meditation and
Eastern philosophy.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Once he had some time to
synthesize all these aspects

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.380 align:middle line:84%
of life, he came to some
profound conclusions that we

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.770 align:middle line:84%
cannot continue on our current
path of greed and environmental

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.740 align:middle line:84%
degradation and expect any kind
of future of abundance and joy.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.100 align:middle line:84%
We need to dig down to the roots
of what true fulfillment is

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.040 align:middle line:84%
and begin living
it, as we repair

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.700 align:middle line:84%
the damage we've done
to our host, the Earth.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.030 align:middle line:84%
He is a gentle soul
with twinkling eyes,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.810 align:middle line:84%
and the depth of his profundity
has been expressed best

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.930 align:middle line:84%
by Buzzword Magazine, in which
he was dubbed Eco Philosopher

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:90%
Extraordinaire.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.425 align:middle line:90%
Meet Peter Russell.

00:00:47.425 --> 00:00:57.519 align:middle line:90%


00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And one of the areas
you were talking about

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.760 align:middle line:84%
is paradigm shift, an existing
paradigm encounters an anomaly.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.204 align:middle line:84%
And so, what do you consider,
at this point in time,

00:01:07.204 --> 00:01:09.300 align:middle line:90%
the anomaly that is facing us?

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, the anomaly is to
the current great worldview

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.950 align:middle line:84%
of modern science, which
is that space, time,

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.550 align:middle line:90%
and matter are real.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.840 align:middle line:84%
That's the current
worldview paradigm.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:84%
The one great problem that
that cannot explain is

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.470 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, the very
fact we have awareness.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.750 align:middle line:84%
According to the modern
scientific viewpoint,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.380 align:middle line:90%
we should all be zomboids.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.660 align:middle line:84%
We should all just-- all
that function should go on,

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.720 align:middle line:84%
but there's no
reason whatsoever why

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.080 align:middle line:90%
we should ever have awareness.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And yet awareness, experience,
is the only thing we cannot

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.470 align:middle line:90%
doubt.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.960 align:middle line:90%
I can never doubt I'm conscious.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's the great paradox
which science cannot explain.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.650 align:middle line:84%
As with any anomaly,
what happens is

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.630 align:middle line:84%
the scientists try to explain
it in terms of the old paradigm.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happened
with Copernicus.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, before Copernicus, they
couldn't explain the planets,

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.800 align:middle line:90%
but they kept on trying.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.215 align:middle line:84%
They assumed the Earth was at
the center of the universe,

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:02.589 align:middle line:84%
and they kept on coming up
with all these complex circles

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle line:84%
rolling around circles, until
eventually Copernicus came up

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.720 align:middle line:84%
with a new model we have
today of the Earth spinning

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.830 align:middle line:90%
around the Sun.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.860 align:middle line:84%
The same is happening
with consciousness.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody's
totally fixed on matter

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:84%
as the ultimate
reality, they're trying

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.706 align:middle line:84%
to explain how consciousness
could possibly come out

00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:23.330 align:middle line:84%
of matter, and they're
getting nowhere.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.790 align:middle line:84%
They've got theories in
quantum physics that try,

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.620 align:middle line:84%
theories in formation sciences,
chemical theories, nothing

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.480 align:middle line:90%
works.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.330 align:middle line:84%
But nobody dares
question the assumption,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.862 align:middle line:84%
and the assumption is that
matter is unconscious.

00:02:36.862 --> 00:02:37.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's the problem.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.920 align:middle line:84%
If matter is unconscious,
the problem is how on Earth

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.890 align:middle line:84%
does consciousness,
awareness, ever arise out

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.410 align:middle line:84%
of something that
has no awareness?

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>You're a physicist
and a mathematician,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.472 align:middle line:84%
and I believe you've been
involved in the computer

00:02:50.472 --> 00:02:51.180 align:middle line:90%
sciences as well.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>Very heavily steeped in
the left brain and science--

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.030 align:middle line:90%
>>Part of me.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>>Part of-- yes.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.240 align:middle line:90%
Part of you.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.775 align:middle line:84%
Why is the scientific community
so frightened of this anomaly,

00:03:02.775 --> 00:03:06.100 align:middle line:90%
so to speak, this new knowledge?

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>>I think it's not so
much they're frightened,

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:90%
they're stuck.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.430 align:middle line:84%
We get stuck in a worldview, and
I think our views of the world

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.960 align:middle line:84%
are the hardest
things to change.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.140 align:middle line:84%
We can change where we live,
we can change our jobs,

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.870 align:middle line:84%
we can change our partners,
we can change everything.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.210 align:middle line:84%
But when you're changing
our fundamental belief

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.330 align:middle line:84%
about reality, it's
very, very difficult.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Max Planck,
the physicist,

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.400 align:middle line:84%
said that new ideas
catch on in science

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.640 align:middle line:84%
not because people
change their minds,

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:84%
but the old scientists die out
and it takes a new generation

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.220 align:middle line:90%
to bring in the new idea.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that
they're frightened,

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.270 align:middle line:90%
it's just they're rigid.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:84%
They only see it
this way and they

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.760 align:middle line:84%
can't believe
anything else is true.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And a case of that I
came across recently

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.180 align:middle line:90%
was with near-death experiences.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.620 align:middle line:84%
This neuropsychologist
was asked to look

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.590 align:middle line:84%
at some evidence for near-death
experience and he refused to.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.570 align:middle line:84%
He said, why should I waste
my time reading something

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.530 align:middle line:90%
which I know is impossible?

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Which is just like
in Galileo's time,

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.260 align:middle line:84%
the bishops refusing to look
down Galileo's telescope

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.761 align:middle line:84%
because what he was saying
they knew was impossible.

00:04:13.761 --> 00:04:14.760 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happens.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.910 align:middle line:90%
We refuse to consider it.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.089 align:middle line:90%
>>So what happens now?

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:20.300 align:middle line:84%
We're at a very tender
and very critical

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.520 align:middle line:84%
point in history in
terms of our ecosystems,

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.910 align:middle line:84%
and not only that,
our technology

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.790 align:middle line:90%
outstripping our wisdom.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.800 align:middle line:90%
Do we wait for them to die?

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.152 align:middle line:84%
What is-- what are we
handing to the young people

00:04:33.152 --> 00:04:33.902 align:middle line:90%
at this very time?

00:04:33.902 --> 00:04:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, it is dying.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.890 align:middle line:84%
You see, the new
generation is coming along

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:38.780 align:middle line:90%
with the new ideas.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.110 align:middle line:90%
It's happening.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.370 align:middle line:84%
When I talk to younger people,
I find they're with it.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.780 align:middle line:84%
They know what
I'm talking about.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.230 align:middle line:84%
They understand
about conscience.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.860 align:middle line:84%
They don't believe in the old
materialistic paradigm so much.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.670 align:middle line:84%
So the new generation
is coming in.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to wait 100
years for people to die,

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.300 align:middle line:90%
it's already happening.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.840 align:middle line:90%
This process is happening.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>So for the people
in their 20s,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.080 align:middle line:84%
they understand that
this is happening.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Functionally speaking,
we have work to do.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.150 align:middle line:84%
What would you suggest is
the first point of what

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.000 align:middle line:90%
needs being done?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>>I think the first
thing we need to do

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.110 align:middle line:84%
is to see that the real issue
facing humanity is basically

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.640 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual issue, an
issue of consciousness,

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.300 align:middle line:90%
an issue of values.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.915 align:middle line:84%
All the problems
that are out there

00:05:24.915 --> 00:05:26.415 align:middle line:84%
whether it's
environmental problems,

00:05:26.415 --> 00:05:29.080 align:middle line:84%
whether it's social
problems, whether it's

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.370 align:middle line:84%
our own personal problems,
when we look at them

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.750 align:middle line:84%
they all come back in the
end to human thinking,

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.560 align:middle line:84%
human consciousness, human
values, human decisions.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.100 align:middle line:84%
What we tend to
do in our society

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.650 align:middle line:84%
is look out there
and try to solve

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.910 align:middle line:90%
the problem, which is important.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.030 align:middle line:84%
If there's a problem with the
environment like global warming

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.850 align:middle line:84%
or destruction of
the ozone layer,

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.540 align:middle line:84%
yes, we need to
look to that problem

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and see what we can do
to stop it, to change it.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.790 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
we have to say, OK,

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.850 align:middle line:84%
what is it in human
consciousness that

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.870 align:middle line:90%
allows us to behave this way?

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Because in some
ways, we're insane.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.520 align:middle line:84%
We like to think of ourselves
as an intelligent species,

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.380 align:middle line:84%
but a species which
can understand it's

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.440 align:middle line:84%
destroying its environment,
and if it continues to do it,

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.320 align:middle line:84%
it may not be here 10,
20, 30 years' time,

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and then continues with the
very same activities that

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.710 align:middle line:90%
are destroying the environment.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.260 align:middle line:90%
It's insane.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.120 align:middle line:90%
And so we need to look at that.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.910 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.640 align:middle line:90%
What is making us insane?

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.230 align:middle line:84%
What is causing us to behave
in ways that are killing us?

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.320 align:middle line:90%
And we don't look at that.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.460 align:middle line:84%
We always look at just
solving one problem then

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.270 align:middle line:84%
another problem, and
we're just fighting fires,

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.390 align:middle line:84%
never looking at what is
it that's causing this.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think the root reason
is because we're out of touch

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.705 align:middle line:90%
with ourselves.

00:06:45.705 --> 00:06:49.720 align:middle line:84%
We're caught up in this
materialistic mindset that

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.339 align:middle line:84%
basically says if you're not
at peace, if you're not happy,

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:52.880 align:middle line:90%
do something.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.560 align:middle line:84%
There's something wrong
with the outside world.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.550 align:middle line:84%
You need to buy something,
get something, go somewhere,

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.880 align:middle line:90%
change your circumstances.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, that
works in the short term.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.688 align:middle line:84%
You go and buy something,
you feel a bit better

00:07:04.688 --> 00:07:07.360 align:middle line:84%
for a little while, and
then you feel bad again.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is what keeps
us consuming, consuming,

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.470 align:middle line:90%
consuming, consuming.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.270 align:middle line:84%
What we need to
realize, I think,

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.180 align:middle line:84%
on a large scale is
that the real problem is

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.290 align:middle line:90%
an inner problem.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.835 align:middle line:84%
And then we can begin
looking at what that is

00:07:20.835 --> 00:07:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and how to free
ourselves from it.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what all the
great spiritual traditions have

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.775 align:middle line:84%
been on that for
thousands of years.

00:07:30.775 --> 00:07:33.410 align:middle line:84%
They come from people
who've realized

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.500 align:middle line:84%
there's another way of being,
another mode of consciousness.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:84%
That we can free ourselves
up from this attachment,

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.360 align:middle line:90%
this materiality.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that, we
begin to become more in tune

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.080 align:middle line:84%
with our world, with our
environment, with other people.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.450 align:middle line:90%
We become more compassionate.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And they've all developed
various techniques, practices,

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.810 align:middle line:84%
exercises, which help liberate
the mind, to free the mind.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.970 align:middle line:84%
So I think the next
stage is having realized

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.900 align:middle line:84%
that's the basic
problem, is then say, OK,

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.110 align:middle line:84%
what do we know just
looking at the world's

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.610 align:middle line:84%
spiritual traditions and other
metaphysical traditions, what

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.270 align:middle line:84%
do we know that can really help
free up human consciousness

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.080 align:middle line:84%
and have-- what I
would like to see

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.810 align:middle line:84%
is an outfit called the
Inner Manhattan Project.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Just as the original
Manhattan Project

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.190 align:middle line:84%
recognized there was
this incredible potential

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.040 align:middle line:84%
in the nucleus of the
atom and they then

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.420 align:middle line:84%
got together and turned it
into an atomic bomb, which

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:84%
wasn't necessarily such a good
idea, but the principal is,

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.680 align:middle line:84%
everybody got together
to solve a problem.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think we could
do the same recognizing

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.809 align:middle line:84%
this incredible potential in
human consciousness, which

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:42.049 align:middle line:84%
is not being accessed at the
moment and that that-- in that

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:43.409 align:middle line:90%
is our salvation.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And if we worked on that
collectively-- if institutions,

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.430 align:middle line:84%
individuals, organizations,
whatever, made

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.800 align:middle line:84%
that a real focus, I
think in a very short time

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.080 align:middle line:84%
we could actually have
processes, techniques,

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.180 align:middle line:84%
things we could
disseminate to the public

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.760 align:middle line:84%
which would really
encourage that awakening

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.546 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:09:02.546 --> 00:09:04.364 align:middle line:84%
>>So if you're
speaking to someone

00:09:04.364 --> 00:09:07.692 align:middle line:84%
who's 22 years old that
are out in cyber world

00:09:07.692 --> 00:09:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and they're just looking for
another chat room or something

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.080 align:middle line:84%
intriguing out there, what do
you say to them very directly

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.430 align:middle line:84%
to make them even care enough
to examine these ideas?

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>I think, what
do we really want?

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:25.620 align:middle line:84%
What is each of us looking
for in the final analysis?

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.240 align:middle line:84%
We're looking to
feel OK in ourselves.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:84%
We're looking to feel more at
ease, satisfied, fulfilled,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:35.760 align:middle line:90%
at peace.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.330 align:middle line:90%
There's many different things.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.770 align:middle line:84%
But basically,
what we're looking

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.920 align:middle line:90%
for is an inner state of being.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And whether we do that
through going to the movies,

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.780 align:middle line:84%
buying things, eating food,
being in a chat discussion

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.880 align:middle line:84%
with somebody, whatever it is,
engaged in some game that's

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.570 align:middle line:84%
really stimulating, grabbing
us, or just mind-blowing

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.000 align:middle line:84%
visuals, whatever it is,
we're all looking, ultimately,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.800 align:middle line:90%
for an inner state.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.130 align:middle line:84%
But if we get too caught up
in looking for it out there,

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:04.640 align:middle line:90%
we get attached to the process.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And so if it's being in a
certain conversation that

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.942 align:middle line:84%
does it, we become
dependent upon that.

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think what all the
traditions are saying,

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.890 align:middle line:84%
there's a way to access
that in ourselves

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.180 align:middle line:84%
whereby we don't
become dependent

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.810 align:middle line:84%
upon the circumstances
out there.

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's about finding
an unconditional peace,

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:26.276 align:middle line:84%
an unconditional ease that
we can take around with us.

00:10:26.276 --> 00:10:28.650 align:middle line:84%
So rather than being out there
looking for something when

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:84%
we don't have it,
feeling badly, then

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.800 align:middle line:84%
going off getting our
next fix, whether it's

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.600 align:middle line:84%
a cyber fix or a chemical fix,
it's all the same pattern.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.805 align:middle line:84%
We're finding a fix,
and then feeling bad

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:40.670 align:middle line:90%
and looking for something else.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.090 align:middle line:84%
If you can discover
that to yourself,

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:45.280 align:middle line:84%
that deeper sense of
ease, which is just

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.000 align:middle line:84%
an unconditional
satisfaction, then I

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.260 align:middle line:84%
think one feels much
more at home in the world

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.200 align:middle line:84%
and you're not having to take
from the world the whole time.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.157 align:middle line:84%
And I also think
you're-- it feeds back

00:10:59.157 --> 00:11:00.115 align:middle line:90%
into our relationships.

00:11:00.115 --> 00:11:02.890 align:middle line:84%
I think we're better
able to relate to people

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:07.860 align:middle line:84%
if we're in a more centered,
at home state in ourselves.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>So this is not simply a
woo-woo metaphysical concept

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.240 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.050 align:middle line:84%
This is a reality
that is dawning,

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.892 align:middle line:84%
and really, perhaps,
the only path

00:11:17.892 --> 00:11:19.600 align:middle line:84%
to taking the next
step as a civilization

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.090 align:middle line:84%
without doing ourselves and
the planet further harm.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:27.014 align:middle line:84%
>>I think it's an absolutely
essential aspect of the path.

00:11:27.014 --> 00:11:28.180 align:middle line:90%
I do want to emphasize that.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And we do need to stop
a lot of the things that

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.940 align:middle line:84%
are going on that are
creating more of a mess.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
we have to include

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.300 align:middle line:84%
this aspect of awakening
ourselves, freeing ourselves

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.770 align:middle line:84%
from the patterns, the
mindsets, the assumptions,

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:46.050 align:middle line:84%
the conditioning that causes
us to behave in that way.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:47.190 align:middle line:90%
But we need both together.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.310 align:middle line:84%
So I would say it's an
absolutely critical part.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.684 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have
that, we're just

00:11:50.684 --> 00:11:55.150 align:middle line:84%
going to continue the mess
until we're no longer here.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>My question is, what becomes
our responsibility then?

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Once you understand
consciousness is everything,

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.440 align:middle line:84%
then what becomes
our responsibility

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.240 align:middle line:84%
in reacting to
that knowledge that

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.660 align:middle line:90%
can't be denied any further?

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>>I think once we
realize that-- I mean,

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:12.830 align:middle line:90%
everything is in consciousness.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And the first
thing to realize is

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:19.640 align:middle line:84%
to take responsibility
for our own consciousness.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.105 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to say other
people must change,

00:12:23.105 --> 00:12:25.950 align:middle line:84%
but we're all part of
them, I'm part of them,

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.050 align:middle line:90%
we must all change.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:30.205 align:middle line:84%
And the only person I really
have responsibility for

00:12:30.205 --> 00:12:31.030 align:middle line:90%
is myself.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:35.870 align:middle line:84%
It's how do I free myself
from outdated conditioning,

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:39.430 align:middle line:90%
education, all that stuff?

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And the nice thing about
that is the more I do that,

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:44.900 align:middle line:90%
the better I feel.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.970 align:middle line:90%
The more at ease I feel.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And the key thing
is when we realize

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:55.260 align:middle line:84%
that everything we experience
is our own creation-- I

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.440 align:middle line:90%
have to say we experience.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.920 align:middle line:84%
I want to make
clear I'm not saying

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.655 align:middle line:84%
the external physical
reality is our own creation,

00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:03.670 align:middle line:84%
although some people say
that, I'm not saying that.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.220 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying
is our perception

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.170 align:middle line:84%
of the external reality
is our own creation.

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Everything we know is in
our own consciousness,

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.590 align:middle line:84%
and that means all
the interpretations

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:18.170 align:middle line:84%
we lay upon it are in
our own consciousness.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Everything we see
about things, the way

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:24.820 align:middle line:84%
we judge things is
all in the mind.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:28.510 align:middle line:84%
To realize that the way
we feel, very often,

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.020 align:middle line:84%
is the result of our
own interpretation

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.860 align:middle line:90%
and what we lay on a situation.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.620 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you
get caught and you're

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.610 align:middle line:84%
standing in line in
a queue somewhere,

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.390 align:middle line:84%
it's very easy to get upset
thinking, I'm going to be late

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:42.640 align:middle line:90%
or I'm being delayed.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.897 align:middle line:90%
This is wasting my time.

00:13:43.897 --> 00:13:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And that stupid
person in front of me,

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.120 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in a checkout
line at the supermarket

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.660 align:middle line:84%
or waiting for the theater or
in a traffic jam, to realize we

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.590 align:middle line:84%
are making ourselves upset
because of how we're seeing it.

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else could be sitting
in exactly the situation,

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:00.140 align:middle line:84%
standing in the same line,
and saying, this is wonderful.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.480 align:middle line:84%
I've got a couple of
moments to myself.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.690 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's bothering me.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Exactly the same situation,
two different reactions.

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- this I often
call Spirituality 101,

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:15.660 align:middle line:84%
is realizing that
we have a choice.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:19.300 align:middle line:84%
At every single
moment of our lives,

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.310 align:middle line:84%
we have a choice about
how we see things.

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:24.400 align:middle line:84%
We can either see things
through the eyes of fear,

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.280 align:middle line:84%
or we can see things as they
are in the present moment.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's a hard choice to make,
because most the time we're

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.270 align:middle line:84%
so caught up with our
concerns, fear, worry,

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.840 align:middle line:84%
what's going on inside our
heads, all of our thinking,

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.470 align:middle line:84%
but in principle
that choice is there.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of our
practice is, whatever

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.230 align:middle line:84%
we're doing, just
coming back and saying,

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:46.570 align:middle line:84%
let me just experience
this moment.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And one way to do that is
just to come back to the body.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.660 align:middle line:90%
How's my body feel?

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.790 align:middle line:84%
We get so caught
up in our heads,

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.580 align:middle line:84%
whether it's-- all
our technology puts us

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.180 align:middle line:84%
into our heads whether
it's reading, computers,

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.080 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is, it
gets into the mind.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.010 align:middle line:84%
We're thinking,
working things out.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:03.980 align:middle line:90%
Language puts us in our heads.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.040 align:middle line:90%
Just stop and feel the body.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much going on
the body that we don't notice.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.840 align:middle line:90%
Just oh, how's it feeling?

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Or there's the pressure of
the chair, there's my feet,

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.120 align:middle line:84%
or there's my
breathing-- so much.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.525 align:middle line:84%
And 20 seconds later, you'll
be off in your head again.

00:15:18.525 --> 00:15:21.660 align:middle line:84%
But as a practice, to keep
coming back to the body,

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.280 align:middle line:84%
coming back to the now,
coming back to the present

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.760 align:middle line:84%
is exercising that choice
over how we see things

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.540 align:middle line:84%
when we come back
to the present--

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.220 align:middle line:84%
because the body is always in
the present, the experience

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:31.737 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:15:31.737 --> 00:15:34.320 align:middle line:84%
The thoughts we have about the
body may not be in the present,

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.820 align:middle line:84%
but the experience
of the body is always

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.185 align:middle line:90%
in the present moment.

00:15:38.185 --> 00:15:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way to
exercise that choice,

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.140 align:middle line:90%
to keep coming back.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.500 align:middle line:84%
How am I actually feeling
in my body right now?

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.270 align:middle line:84%
If we just did that 50 times
a day for a few seconds,

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:52.180 align:middle line:90%
our lives would start changing.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.040 align:middle line:10%
>>So how do we bridge
what some are terming--

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.680 align:middle line:10%
there's even a
website now called

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:01.630 align:middle line:10%
The Great Divide-- bridge the
consciousness that is coming

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:04.840 align:middle line:10%
into our awareness, the
consciousness we're becoming

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.920 align:middle line:10%
aware of, and our dependence
upon the world of science

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.100 align:middle line:10%
and the PhDs of the
world telling us

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.580 align:middle line:10%
what our reality should be.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.550 align:middle line:10%
There's a great chasm right now.

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:21.960 align:middle line:10%
>>I think it's-- it's going to--
that divide is going to close

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.600 align:middle line:10%
as we really begin to
understand consciousness.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.580 align:middle line:84%
I think, at the moment,
that divide is partly caused

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.860 align:middle line:84%
by science in its
arrogance thinking

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.920 align:middle line:84%
it can explain
consciousness away.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.110 align:middle line:84%
What all the great metaphysical
and spiritual traditions

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:39.160 align:middle line:84%
have said is that
consciousness is

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.540 align:middle line:84%
a fundamental quality
of the cosmos.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.880 align:middle line:84%
You can't explain
it away, it is.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.890 align:middle line:84%
It is the very nature of
things, consciousness.

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:51.700 align:middle line:84%
When science begins to
see that-- and I think

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.540 align:middle line:84%
it slowly is moving
that direction.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I go to conferences where I'm
finding scientists beginning

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.660 align:middle line:84%
to stand up and a
few of them beginning

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.951 align:middle line:84%
to talk about that and people
are debating and arguing,

00:17:00.951 --> 00:17:03.370 align:middle line:84%
but it's beginning
to be written about.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.540 align:middle line:84%
When people realize
that making that shift

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.390 align:middle line:84%
doesn't actually threaten
anything at all in science,

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:11.750 align:middle line:84%
all of biology, physics,
chemistry, mathematics

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.579 align:middle line:84%
all works perfectly
well, but it starts

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:17.589 align:middle line:84%
to change our whole
attitude to ourselves.

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:20.160 align:middle line:84%
When we start seeing
consciousness in that way,

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.618 align:middle line:84%
and I think what
we're going to see

00:17:21.618 --> 00:17:24.460 align:middle line:84%
is that divide between
science and spirituality

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.400 align:middle line:90%
will begin to disappear.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Because I think the
spiritual traditions really

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:32.500 align:middle line:84%
come from the
people who've chosen

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.950 align:middle line:84%
to explore consciousness
first-hand.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And in the past, that's
been done typically

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.890 align:middle line:84%
by people being in monasteries,
or going and sitting in caves,

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.440 align:middle line:84%
or doing long
meditation practice.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And today, we have many
more ways of doing that.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's being in a
float tank, or psychedelics,

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:52.340 align:middle line:84%
or there's many
different workshops,

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.100 align:middle line:84%
people exploring
consciousness first hand,

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.574 align:middle line:84%
and science hasn't
thought about that.

00:17:57.574 --> 00:17:58.990 align:middle line:84%
The way science
chooses to explore

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.406 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is to, you know,
put electrodes on the brain

00:18:01.406 --> 00:18:04.030 align:middle line:84%
and have a guess at what's
happening inside the mind.

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:06.520 align:middle line:84%
The only way to really
explore consciousness,

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.350 align:middle line:84%
to explore awareness, is
to explore it first-hand.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Awareness is a
subjective phenomena.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.710 align:middle line:84%
You don't explore it
by studying matter.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.010 align:middle line:84%
You explore it by
getting in there,

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:18.240 align:middle line:90%
observing your own awareness.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Self-observation,
self-realization,

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:21.580 align:middle line:90%
self-knowledge.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:26.496 align:middle line:84%
It comes by watching the
mind, observing the mind.

00:18:26.496 --> 00:18:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I first
started getting interested

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.800 align:middle line:84%
in spirituality was
back in the '60s.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:84%
I was a child of the
'60s-- not a child,

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.260 align:middle line:84%
but I was heavily
involved in all

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.760 align:middle line:84%
that was going on
in the '60s, and I

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.134 align:middle line:84%
started getting interested in
meditation and spirituality

00:18:39.134 --> 00:18:39.895 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:18:39.895 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:84%
But there was nothing
much around on it.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:43.530 align:middle line:84%
I went to my local
bookstore in Cambridge,

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.780 align:middle line:84%
which was the second biggest
bookstore in England,

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:49.860 align:middle line:84%
they had one shelf on sort of
alternative spiritual ideas.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And to see how things have
changed now 40 years later,

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:55.200 align:middle line:84%
you go into any
modest-size town,

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.112 align:middle line:84%
there's whole bookstores
devoted to spiritual stuff.

00:18:58.112 --> 00:18:59.195 align:middle line:90%
Often it's called New Age.

00:18:59.195 --> 00:19:01.120 align:middle line:84%
I hate the term New
Age, but alternative

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.660 align:middle line:84%
thinking about consciousness
and expanding consciousness.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:08.630 align:middle line:84%
You look at the books on the
New York Times Bestseller List,

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:12.950 align:middle line:84%
any week if you look at the top
10, three, four, five of them

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:15.050 align:middle line:84%
are on consciousness,
spirituality

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:16.290 align:middle line:90%
in one way or another.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:18.410 align:middle line:84%
That's what people
are fascinated by.

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:20.482 align:middle line:84%
You look at the
number of yoga groups,

00:19:20.482 --> 00:19:22.690 align:middle line:84%
the number of organizations,
the number of workshops.

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:25.580 align:middle line:84%
It's all been growing
exponentially since the '60s.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.220 align:middle line:84%
It got kicked off
in the '60s and it's

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.240 align:middle line:84%
been expanding and
expanding and expanding.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.866 align:middle line:84%
And we're all learning
from each other.

00:19:31.866 --> 00:19:33.823 align:middle line:84%
In the past, if you were
interesting in raising

00:19:33.823 --> 00:19:35.700 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, you
might, if you were lucky,

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.040 align:middle line:84%
have found somebody
in your community who

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.890 align:middle line:84%
was a wise person who
could have helped you.

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:41.020 align:middle line:90%
If you were lucky.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Today, we've got the literature
from all around the world,

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:45.250 align:middle line:90%
from the past.

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.970 align:middle line:84%
We can dig back into what the
Vedas were saying in India

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.810 align:middle line:84%
5,000 years ago, what
Buddha was saying.

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:53.380 align:middle line:84%
We can get videos
of what shamans

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.730 align:middle line:90%
are teaching in South America.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:59.150 align:middle line:84%
We've got the whole of our
culture, spiritual teachings

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:02.520 align:middle line:84%
on tap, both across space
and down through time.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.050 align:middle line:90%
Never has that been possible.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we are beginning
to see that common wisdom,

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.600 align:middle line:84%
and we're beginning to bring
that wisdom into the light.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.802 align:middle line:84%
And there's more and more
and more people doing it.

00:20:13.802 --> 00:20:15.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, somebody
asked me recently, they

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:17.800 align:middle line:84%
said, what are you saying
that's different from what

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.130 align:middle line:90%
everybody else is saying?

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.260 align:middle line:84%
My response was,
nothing, I hope.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.179 align:middle line:84%
If there is, that's
where I'm wrong.

00:20:23.179 --> 00:20:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Because I think what's-- because
we're all learning from each

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.580 align:middle line:90%
other.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.770 align:middle line:84%
I happen to write
books, but I learn

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.572 align:middle line:84%
from people, other books or
people I chat to, whatever.

00:20:31.572 --> 00:20:33.030 align:middle line:84%
We're all learning
from each other.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.690 align:middle line:90%
So we are growing together.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:36.630 align:middle line:84%
So there is this
mass awakening that's

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:38.580 align:middle line:90%
happening in our culture.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that really
brings that home to me

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:43.870 align:middle line:84%
is when I talk to
younger people, people

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:48.970 align:middle line:84%
in their teens, 20s, I
find there's as much wisdom

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:53.080 align:middle line:84%
there as in anybody else
of any age on the planet.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And I might think because
I'm 40 years-- I've

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.500 align:middle line:84%
been working on this 40
years longer than-- I've

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:04.220 align:middle line:84%
been meditating that much
longer, I'm 40 years wiser.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.740 align:middle line:84%
I am 40 years wiser, but
so is everybody else.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.130 align:middle line:90%
We're all 40 years wiser.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you could take
some of the younger people

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.720 align:middle line:84%
today who I see so
much wisdom there

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.065 align:middle line:90%
that didn't exist in the '60s.

00:21:19.065 --> 00:21:21.720 align:middle line:84%
If I could take some of these
people in a time machine,

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.130 align:middle line:84%
take them back into
the '60s, people

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.474 align:middle line:84%
there would not know
what to make of them.

00:21:26.474 --> 00:21:27.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, apart from
the fact no one

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:29.640 align:middle line:84%
there had any
piercing or tattoos

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.160 align:middle line:84%
or could ride
skateboards, but just

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:36.000 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their understanding,
their wisdom, their compassion,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.960 align:middle line:84%
their vision of the world--
that didn't exist back then.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:46.700 align:middle line:84%
They'd be classed as some
weird, wise shaman, any kid

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.750 align:middle line:90%
today back in the '60s.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:52.190 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, is a sign of the
times of how we have moved on.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And that process
is accelerating,

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:57.670 align:middle line:84%
because whenever you
get collective learning,

00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:58.920 align:middle line:90%
you get feedback.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's not I am
learning on my own,

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.790 align:middle line:84%
we're all learning together,
and that feedback always

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:04.920 align:middle line:90%
produces acceleration.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.930 align:middle line:84%
It's like compound
interest in a bank.

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:09.400 align:middle line:84%
The money keeps growing
faster, and faster, and faster.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.590 align:middle line:84%
This is compound interest
in consciousness,

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:13.710 align:middle line:84%
because we are all
learning from each other.

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And so we're growing
faster and faster.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's what gives
me hope for the future,

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:25.620 align:middle line:84%
is we are in dire times,
severely critical times.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether we're
going to make it or not.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.570 align:middle line:90%
It's touch and go.

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:34.080 align:middle line:84%
But I know the only way
is through an awakening

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.730 align:middle line:84%
and a liberation of
the human spirit.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:39.030 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way we're
going to get through this.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And that is happening
faster and faster.

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:46.600 align:middle line:84%
I think there's one thing
that's important for everybody,

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.850 align:middle line:84%
whatever our age, whatever
our culture, wherever

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:52.320 align:middle line:84%
we are in history, and it's a
universal thing which comes up

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:58.260 align:middle line:84%
time and time again, which,
put most simply, is be kind.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.590 align:middle line:84%
All the spiritual traditions
have it as the Golden Rule

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:04.470 align:middle line:84%
and the basis of it is is
do as you would be done by.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:07.300 align:middle line:84%
None of us want to feel
conflicted or stressed

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:08.385 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is.

00:23:08.385 --> 00:23:11.320 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
is if you-- if I

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.260 align:middle line:84%
get slightly aggrieved with you
over something you say or do,

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:18.140 align:middle line:84%
what I tend to do is come
back attacking, criticizing

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.340 align:middle line:90%
you or something.

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:21.849 align:middle line:84%
I deliberately try
to make you feel bad.

00:23:21.849 --> 00:23:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And then you do feel bad,
and you come back at me

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:25.930 align:middle line:84%
and deliberately try
to make me feel bad.

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And we get caught in this
stupid vicious circle where

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:32.605 align:middle line:84%
the game is I think if I'm
a little bit nasty to you,

00:23:32.605 --> 00:23:35.980 align:middle line:84%
you might wake up, realize
the error of your ways

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:36.731 align:middle line:90%
and be nice to me.

00:23:36.731 --> 00:23:38.896 align:middle line:84%
But you're doing the same
thing and you're thinking,

00:23:38.896 --> 00:23:41.180 align:middle line:84%
if I'm just a little bit
nasty and mean to him,

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:44.350 align:middle line:84%
he'll be nice to me,
and it doesn't work.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And it ruins so many
personal relationships.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And you look at what goes on
internationally, the Cold War.

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:51.430 align:middle line:84%
For years, two big
nations saying,

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.980 align:middle line:84%
if I make you feel more
threatened, more vulnerable,

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.090 align:middle line:84%
you'll be nice to us
and won't attack us.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:57.940 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:59.550 align:middle line:84%
What's happening
in the world with,

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:01.970 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the quote,
"War Against Terrorism,"

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:04.450 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is, it's
all the time people

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:06.860 align:middle line:84%
doing this trying to
hurt the other people.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.130 align:middle line:84%
We think if we hurt other
people, they'll be nice to us.

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:12.400 align:middle line:84%
It's stupid, but
that's what we do.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.980 align:middle line:84%
The way out of it
is what I think

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.650 align:middle line:84%
all the great teachers
have recognized

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:18.280 align:middle line:84%
is give the other
person what they want.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:23.000 align:middle line:84%
It's how do you say things so
that the other person feels

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.420 align:middle line:90%
respected, they feel cared for?

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.760 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha said if you can't
say something in such a way

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:33.940 align:middle line:84%
that the other person feels
respected and loved, hold on.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.180 align:middle line:90%
Wait until you can say it.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is
the essential message.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.090 align:middle line:90%
That, for me, is kindness.

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Being kind is caring for
how the other person feels.

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:47.296 align:middle line:84%
If we do that,
everything changes.

00:24:47.296 --> 00:24:48.795 align:middle line:84%
When I do that in
my relationships--

00:24:48.795 --> 00:24:51.000 align:middle line:84%
when I'm in a
relationship with somebody

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.080 align:middle line:84%
and we have the
agreement between us

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.940 align:middle line:84%
that our intention is
that whatever we do,

00:24:55.940 --> 00:25:00.670 align:middle line:84%
we want the other person to
feel loved, at ease, respected,

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:02.280 align:middle line:90%
everything changes.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.614 align:middle line:90%
First of all, I mean, I'll fail.

00:25:03.614 --> 00:25:05.613 align:middle line:84%
There'll be times when
I'm niggled and irritated

00:25:05.613 --> 00:25:06.830 align:middle line:90%
and I'll say something mean.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:09.260 align:middle line:90%
But then it's like, I'm sorry.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.500 align:middle line:90%
I didn't mean to.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.035 align:middle line:84%
Or what was it I
said that upset you?

00:25:14.035 --> 00:25:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I can learn not
to use those words.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Or there's a button
there I pressed.

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, we can learn how
to be more loving, more kind.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that, you find
this incredible thing happens.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:27.914 align:middle line:84%
This new sort of love
begins to enter the world,

00:25:27.914 --> 00:25:30.080 align:middle line:84%
begins to enter your life,
enter your relationships.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:34.107 align:middle line:84%
It's not the love of I love
you, sort of that passionate,

00:25:34.107 --> 00:25:34.940 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is love.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.175 align:middle line:84%
It's just this context of
just lovingness that is there.

00:25:38.175 --> 00:25:41.282 align:middle line:90%
