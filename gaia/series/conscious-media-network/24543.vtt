<v ->David Berceli is a former monk who spent</v>

2
00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:06.065
many years of his life traveling to worn-torn nations

3
00:00:06.065 --> 00:00:08.048
to assist the people through the trauma

4
00:00:08.048 --> 00:00:10.522
and its ravaging affects on their lives.

5
00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:13.680
His work resulted in what he now calls TRE,

6
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.340
or trauma release exercises, which he shares with

7
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.454
veterans returning from Iraq to ordinary citizens.

8
00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:23.643
In brief, he says that the trauma is retained in our body

9
00:00:23.643 --> 00:00:26.544
long after the event, and it results in many dysfunctional

10
00:00:26.544 --> 00:00:30.053
patterns that affect our minds, bodies, and emotions.

11
00:00:30.053 --> 00:00:33.040
By releasing the body's trauma patterns, we can begin

12
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.376
to heal our lives, both individually and collectively.

14
00:00:45.167 --> 00:00:47.706
<v Voiceover>You're a very well-traveled human being.</v>

15
00:00:47.706 --> 00:00:50.255
It's my understanding that you speak several languages,

16
00:00:50.255 --> 00:00:53.748
and you have seen the effects of trauma

17
00:00:53.748 --> 00:00:55.990
around the globe.

18
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.509
<v ->Yeah, I've had the fortunate opportunity to actually live</v>

19
00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:01.770
in a number of countries in Africa and the Middle East

20
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.373
for many years and have traveled through them

21
00:01:04.373 --> 00:01:08.000
for many years. Many of these countries were at war,

22
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.293
so I had the opportunity to see hundreds of thousands

23
00:01:11.293 --> 00:01:13.849
of traumatized people. I saw populations that were

24
00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:18.368
traumatized rather than individuals as a clinician.

25
00:01:18.368 --> 00:01:21.621
That gave me a different perspective on trauma.

26
00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:25.546
<v Voiceover>Would you say that if you take war</v>

27
00:01:25.546 --> 00:01:30.527
out of the equation, the traumas that you see in human kind

28
00:01:30.527 --> 00:01:34.385
are fairly well balanced,

29
00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:38.097
are fairly similar regardless of the culture?

30
00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:39.793
Do we all experience more or less the same things,

31
00:01:39.793 --> 00:01:42.289
or is it very culture-specific, the types of trauma

32
00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.499
we experience?

33
00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:45.998
<v ->There's a little bit of both.</v>

34
00:01:45.998 --> 00:01:49.226
This is what my take on trauma is, from having really

35
00:01:49.226 --> 00:01:52.198
traveled to many, many countries around the world and worked

36
00:01:52.198 --> 00:01:55.291
with many populations, is that trauma

37
00:01:55.291 --> 00:02:00.027
literally is a natural experience of the human person,

38
00:02:00.027 --> 00:02:03.302
just as it it's any other animal or plant.

39
00:02:03.302 --> 00:02:06.374
If you consider that we're a living organism on the planet,

40
00:02:06.374 --> 00:02:10.566
not only are we traumatized, but we are genetically encoded

41
00:02:10.566 --> 00:02:14.438
to endure that trauma, survive it, and I believe even learn

42
00:02:14.438 --> 00:02:16.710
from the trauma, and that's what the process of

43
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.845
evolution has been. I believe that trauma's absolutely

44
00:02:19.845 --> 00:02:22.299
natural to the human organism just as it is

45
00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.632
to any organism on the planet.

46
00:02:23.632 --> 00:02:25.147
<v Voiceover>To an orchid.</v>

47
00:02:25.147 --> 00:02:27.588
<v ->Exactly.</v>

48
00:02:27.588 --> 00:02:30.553
There is no animal that you couldn't find that's available

49
00:02:30.553 --> 00:02:32.729
to be being traumatized throughout all of life.

50
00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:34.785
The only thing we've done as humans is we've socialized

51
00:02:34.785 --> 00:02:38.241
it more, but in general, even if we didn't socialize trauma,

52
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.929
we'd still have to put up with hurricanes and earthquakes

53
00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:45.394
and devastation and death,

54
00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:46.416
which is natural to us.

55
00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:48.085
<v Voiceover>So these are normal types of trauma</v>

56
00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:50.464
you experience in the earth experience,

57
00:02:50.464 --> 00:02:54.101
but really now what we're seeing is more self-induced types

58
00:02:54.101 --> 00:02:56.949
of trauma to our own societies through

59
00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:58.709
many different sources.

60
00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:59.392
<v ->Right.</v>

61
00:02:59.392 --> 00:03:01.994
<v Voiceover>We'll start getting into some of what you're</v>

62
00:03:01.994 --> 00:03:05.920
seeing by way of beyond and above the ordinary sources

63
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.469
of trauma, more self-inflicted traumas.

64
00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:09.461
<v ->Right. Exactly.</v>

65
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:11.594
<v Voiceover>What are you experiencing and noticing?</v>

66
00:03:11.594 --> 00:03:12.960
<v ->Well, usually what happens,</v>

67
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.202
let's take war as an example,

68
00:03:16.202 --> 00:03:19.231
if war occurs and there's a tremendous amount of violence

69
00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:22.849
and traumatizing of people, five years after that,

70
00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.777
studies have already demonstrated that you'll have

71
00:03:24.777 --> 00:03:27.721
a much higher increase in domestic violence

72
00:03:27.721 --> 00:03:30.761
and social traumas. You'd have a lot of childhood abuse,

73
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:34.088
a lot of domestic violence going on, and the ways that

74
00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:38.270
we express trauma socially is by demeaning human beings,

75
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.427
or trying to prove ourselves to be better,

76
00:03:41.427 --> 00:03:44.404
creating safety in some way, and safety for us

77
00:03:44.404 --> 00:03:48.296
means being in control, and so if I'm out of control,

78
00:03:48.296 --> 00:03:50.931
I will do something to make sure I can submit

79
00:03:50.931 --> 00:03:54.483
the other person or other family members or other people

80
00:03:54.483 --> 00:03:57.171
in the society back into control again,

81
00:03:57.171 --> 00:04:00.147
and therefore I can produce safety for myself and

82
00:04:00.147 --> 00:04:04.073
feel more relaxed. All those various forms of demeaning

83
00:04:04.073 --> 00:04:07.325
or diminishing other human beings is in fact

84
00:04:07.325 --> 00:04:09.661
re-introducing trauma,

85
00:04:09.661 --> 00:04:13.082
a superior-inferior type of behavior pattern.

86
00:04:13.082 --> 00:04:15.693
<v Voiceover>How is this expressing itself in the culture</v>

87
00:04:15.693 --> 00:04:18.040
of the Western world? We're in the United States

88
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.386
as we speak. How does it express itself?

89
00:04:20.386 --> 00:04:22.361
<v ->Well, that's one of the complaints that we have in</v>

90
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:24.725
the Western world, or the United States as an example.

91
00:04:24.725 --> 00:04:26.517
You can find globally that people say,

92
00:04:26.517 --> 00:04:29.034
well, Americans are very self-centered.

93
00:04:29.034 --> 00:04:32.522
Now I'm not suggesting that that's necessarily the case,

94
00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:34.751
because I'm not going to put down the United States,

95
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:37.823
but we, like every other nation on the planet, look for

96
00:04:37.823 --> 00:04:41.194
superiority, and we look for it for the sake of safety.

97
00:04:41.194 --> 00:04:45.546
In that process, we actually can re-introduce or produce

98
00:04:45.546 --> 00:04:50.206
danger by taking third-world nations

99
00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:51.614
and controlling them,

100
00:04:51.614 --> 00:04:54.249
controlling their economic wealth, controlling the way

101
00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:56.393
they have international agreements.

102
00:04:56.393 --> 00:04:59.891
All of those behaviors are about making sure that we feel

103
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:01.262
safe as a nation.

104
00:05:01.262 --> 00:05:02.915
<v Voiceover>And as in most things, when you try to</v>

105
00:05:02.915 --> 00:05:05.955
control another entity, there's usually a backlash.

106
00:05:05.955 --> 00:05:08.387
<v ->Of course, there has to be. We've seen this as</v>

107
00:05:08.387 --> 00:05:11.788
a repetition in the United States and other countries.

108
00:05:11.788 --> 00:05:16.109
All types of colonialization had some sort of backlash.

109
00:05:16.109 --> 00:05:19.073
Africa and Latin America are both suffering still severely

110
00:05:19.073 --> 00:05:22.438
from the trauma of colonialization. And how does that

111
00:05:22.438 --> 00:05:25.382
get expressed? By anger and resentment towards

112
00:05:25.382 --> 00:05:27.974
the first-world nations that colonized them,

113
00:05:27.974 --> 00:05:30.246
but yet at the same time the need to have relationships

114
00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:32.379
with those first-world nations.

115
00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:33.947
It's no different than a family trauma.

116
00:05:33.947 --> 00:05:35.568
<v Voiceover>I was going to say, in a family,</v>

117
00:05:35.568 --> 00:05:37.029
it's a very similar dynamic.

118
00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:39.419
<v ->Right. If the children are traumatized by the parents,</v>

119
00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.893
the children still need the parents. At the same time,

120
00:05:41.893 --> 00:05:44.283
they resent the parents. We're just talking about it

121
00:05:44.283 --> 00:05:46.629
on a more global scale.

122
00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:49.531
<v Voiceover>And when you have this,</v>

123
00:05:49.531 --> 00:05:53.157
you have a very interesting contribution in this field

124
00:05:53.157 --> 00:05:56.613
because yours is how to release that kind of excessive

125
00:05:56.613 --> 00:05:59.045
energy that occurs with trauma.

126
00:05:59.045 --> 00:06:01.690
<v ->Right. Here's what happened to me.</v>

127
00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.454
I was in Africa and the Middle East for many years,

128
00:06:04.454 --> 00:06:07.163
and I saw over and over and over thousands of

129
00:06:07.163 --> 00:06:10.619
traumatized people, and I began to recognize, sort-of

130
00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:13.520
unconsciously at first, that there were certain patterns

131
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.813
that were being repeated, that had nothing to do with

132
00:06:15.813 --> 00:06:19.056
cultural, or language or anything about the particular

133
00:06:19.056 --> 00:06:21.797
backgrounds. These patterns were being repeated

134
00:06:21.797 --> 00:06:25.285
because I was watching the human species

135
00:06:25.285 --> 00:06:27.958
experience trauma, and I was watching how the human

136
00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:32.949
species was re-structuring itself to not only

137
00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:36.864
endure the trauma but survive it. This is when I began

138
00:06:36.864 --> 00:06:38.581
to see these patterns.

139
00:06:38.581 --> 00:06:41.824
What I did was I studied what is the pattern of the human

140
00:06:41.824 --> 00:06:44.000
organism, or the human animal if you will,

141
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.171
in the wild. How do they

142
00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:49.707
protect themselves when

143
00:06:49.707 --> 00:06:51.744
they're being threatened to death?

144
00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:53.248
<v Voiceover>And what did you find?</v>

145
00:06:53.248 --> 00:06:56.096
<v ->What I discovered is that there's a whole pattern</v>

146
00:06:56.096 --> 00:07:00.373
of muscles in the body related to the brain that are

147
00:07:00.373 --> 00:07:03.147
an instinctual sense of muscles that cause us to

148
00:07:03.147 --> 00:07:05.920
defend or protect ourselves. So as an example,

149
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.869
if we heard a loud sound right now, outside,

150
00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:12.272
both of us instinctually would jerk forward,

151
00:07:12.272 --> 00:07:14.021
in a pulling motion.

152
00:07:14.021 --> 00:07:18.170
The automatic and extreme example of that would be

153
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.797
rolling up into the fetal position, because the underbelly

154
00:07:21.797 --> 00:07:24.901
of our human animal structure is the most vulnerable

155
00:07:24.901 --> 00:07:27.162
part of our structure. So we're going to protect that

156
00:07:27.162 --> 00:07:29.552
underbelly, but we're going to do that instinctually,

157
00:07:29.552 --> 00:07:32.592
much like blinking our eyes. You won't think to jerk

158
00:07:32.592 --> 00:07:35.194
forward; you willl just automatically do that.

159
00:07:35.194 --> 00:07:37.957
Well, that's connected to a certain part of the brain

160
00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:41.413
where that's an autonomic response, and it's autonomic

161
00:07:41.413 --> 00:07:43.727
because if you had to think about, you would probably

162
00:07:43.727 --> 00:07:46.746
be dead, in the two seconds that it took to think about

163
00:07:46.746 --> 00:07:49.861
doing that. So, if it's a reflexive reaction, then you're

164
00:07:49.861 --> 00:07:52.474
actually guaranteed greater safety.

165
00:07:52.474 --> 00:07:56.533
What happens with that is as we pull forward like that,

166
00:07:56.533 --> 00:08:01.184
let's say I had prolonged trauma of abuse a child,

167
00:08:01.184 --> 00:08:04.160
as an example, my father beating me or something like that.

168
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.637
I will constantly keep repeating that pattern over and over

169
00:08:07.637 --> 00:08:11.136
and over, so now it becomes part of the ingrained muscular

170
00:08:11.136 --> 00:08:15.434
pattern along with the neural pattern of the traumatic event

171
00:08:15.434 --> 00:08:18.517
so that any time I see somebody who has my father's eyes,

172
00:08:18.517 --> 00:08:21.069
or his voice, or something like that, I'll begin to repeat

173
00:08:21.069 --> 00:08:23.338
that pattern unconsciously.

174
00:08:23.338 --> 00:08:27.477
Once I saw that pattern happen in these traumatized people,

175
00:08:27.477 --> 00:08:31.640
constantly repeating a pulling forward,

176
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.048
sort of a fetal position protection,

177
00:08:34.048 --> 00:08:37.536
I just asked myself, well I know that the neural network

178
00:08:37.536 --> 00:08:41.301
is attached to certain, or all muscle patterns in the body,

179
00:08:41.301 --> 00:08:43.989
and that neural network is a dual pathway,

180
00:08:43.989 --> 00:08:47.434
basically the central nervous system can communicate

181
00:08:47.434 --> 00:08:50.296
from the body up to the brain

182
00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:52.312
or from the brain down to the body.

183
00:08:52.312 --> 00:08:53.378
<v Voiceover>Mm hmm.</v>

184
00:08:53.378 --> 00:08:56.696
<v ->The question became to me, what if I happened to be</v>

185
00:08:56.696 --> 00:09:00.119
able to relax the body? If I can relax the body, can I

186
00:09:00.119 --> 00:09:03.181
change the brain? And we already know we can do this.

187
00:09:03.181 --> 00:09:06.093
You can get a massage, and the massage therapist doesn't

188
00:09:06.093 --> 00:09:08.781
talk to you at all about what the problem is that you had

189
00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:11.970
when you come in; you were full of anxiety as an example.

190
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.709
You can leave the massage session and absolutely

191
00:09:14.709 --> 00:09:17.003
have reduced all of your anxiety, not even remembering

192
00:09:17.003 --> 00:09:19.189
what you were worrying about when you came in.

193
00:09:19.189 --> 00:09:21.952
So we know that we can do something to the body

194
00:09:21.952 --> 00:09:25.248
that affects the brain. My challenge to me,

195
00:09:25.248 --> 00:09:28.405
when I saw thousands of traumatized people, is,

196
00:09:28.405 --> 00:09:30.325
when I don't speak their language, I don't know

197
00:09:30.325 --> 00:09:33.226
their culture, and I can't give each one of them two years

198
00:09:33.226 --> 00:09:35.840
of psychotherapy to help them heal from trauma,

199
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.784
so can I make some intervention in their body

200
00:09:38.784 --> 00:09:41.301
that they could actually repeat themselves

201
00:09:41.301 --> 00:09:44.165
and actually start to reduce their trauma symptoms.

202
00:09:44.165 --> 00:09:47.237
And that's how I developed the trauma reducing exercises.

203
00:09:47.237 --> 00:09:51.791
<v Voiceover>Where did you first read about, hear about</v>

204
00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:55.078
this type of exercise which requires the body to actually

205
00:09:55.078 --> 00:09:58.235
shake or tremble? Which of course, naturally, right after

206
00:09:58.235 --> 00:10:00.454
a traumatic event, we do shake and tremble.

207
00:10:00.454 --> 00:10:01.254
<v ->Right.</v>

208
00:10:01.254 --> 00:10:03.142
<v Voiceover>What's happening there?</v>

209
00:10:03.142 --> 00:10:05.872
<v ->There's very little literature on it, and I actually went</v>

210
00:10:05.872 --> 00:10:09.712
to the literature in animals, actually, to look at what

211
00:10:09.712 --> 00:10:11.291
was happening to animals.

212
00:10:11.291 --> 00:10:14.430
Much of the literature has already demonstrated that

213
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:18.399
after traumatic events, most mammal species will tremor

214
00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:20.565
organically through their whole body,

215
00:10:20.565 --> 00:10:24.049
and the implication of this is that the tremoring is helping

216
00:10:24.049 --> 00:10:28.051
to take the animal out of

217
00:10:28.051 --> 00:10:29.417
their freeze response,

218
00:10:29.417 --> 00:10:32.702
or their trauma response, and help restore the homeostasis,

219
00:10:32.702 --> 00:10:36.286
or the balance in the body. What I realized was, that while

220
00:10:36.286 --> 00:10:39.475
I was living in war, not only in war. We have common

221
00:10:39.475 --> 00:10:42.387
examples of that in our cultures at large, but when we

222
00:10:42.387 --> 00:10:46.056
get anxious or nervous, we begin to tremor, even if

223
00:10:46.056 --> 00:10:48.787
it's something positive, like you're getting married.

224
00:10:48.787 --> 00:10:51.774
You could find that your hands are tremoring, or your knees

225
00:10:51.774 --> 00:10:54.323
are tremoring, not because you're afraid, but you're

226
00:10:54.323 --> 00:10:58.377
overcharged. Basically the body has too much charge in it,

227
00:10:58.377 --> 00:11:01.245
and the tremor is the natural release valve to actually

228
00:11:01.245 --> 00:11:04.445
reduce the charge back down to normal.

229
00:11:04.445 --> 00:11:07.091
Here we have a lot of traumatized people, or people

230
00:11:07.091 --> 00:11:09.907
who are scared. If your boss is yelling at you, your voice

231
00:11:09.907 --> 00:11:14.163
might quiver. If you are holding back crying or sadness,

232
00:11:14.163 --> 00:11:16.605
your jaw will often quiver.

233
00:11:16.605 --> 00:11:18.995
People after a car accident, even if they're not injured,

234
00:11:18.995 --> 00:11:23.346
will just come out and say I shook uncontrollably all over.

235
00:11:23.346 --> 00:11:26.333
Well, what we did is we defined that shaking as

236
00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:29.021
a pathological expression of the trauma,

237
00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:32.520
rather than potential positive effect of a restoration

238
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.066
of the homeostasis in the body.

239
00:11:34.066 --> 00:11:34.952
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

240
00:11:34.952 --> 00:11:37.565
<v ->So when I lived in war enough, and I certainly tremored</v>

241
00:11:37.565 --> 00:11:40.850
enough, and I certainly lived with thousands of people

242
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.338
that were tremoring, I began to equate that the tremoring

243
00:11:44.338 --> 00:11:47.335
that mammals do must be the same thing that's going on

244
00:11:47.335 --> 00:11:50.834
in humans, although we're defining it as a pathology.

245
00:11:50.834 --> 00:11:54.674
So I began to develop exercises to help actually evoke

246
00:11:54.674 --> 00:11:58.727
those tremors. I wanted to see if we evoked the tremors,

247
00:11:58.727 --> 00:12:01.586
and we actually stay in the tremoring response,

248
00:12:01.586 --> 00:12:05.714
one, will it operate automatically by itself,

249
00:12:05.714 --> 00:12:09.778
and two, after we've tremored, will it in fact reduce

250
00:12:09.778 --> 00:12:12.755
the anxiety or the hyper-arousal reactions we're having

251
00:12:12.755 --> 00:12:14.225
as a result of the trauma?

252
00:12:14.225 --> 00:12:17.649
And I found out that it does do that.

253
00:12:17.649 --> 00:12:19.790
<v Voiceover>Interesting.</v>

254
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.341
Again, can you go,

255
00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:24.018
you can do this without any particular intention?

256
00:12:24.018 --> 00:12:26.973
You just go through the exercise and the body will just,

257
00:12:26.973 --> 00:12:30.258
on a, we say unconscious, or a subconscious level,

258
00:12:30.258 --> 00:12:33.490
begin releasing these traumas you've stored all your life?

259
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:37.682
<v ->Yeah. All I'm doing is working the anatomy and</v>

260
00:12:37.682 --> 00:12:40.370
the physiology of the body. I don't care about the ego

261
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.490
or the psychology. I just know anatomically

262
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.391
if I can work the muscles in a certain pattern,

263
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:48.642
they will organically begin to tremor.

264
00:12:48.642 --> 00:12:51.559
You don't even have to think about it or worry about it.

265
00:12:51.559 --> 00:12:53.351
<v Voiceover>It's interesting. I was reading in one</v>

266
00:12:53.351 --> 00:12:55.570
of your papers. It was an article written on you

267
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:57.021
in a newspaper.

268
00:12:57.021 --> 00:12:59.186
This one woman was saying when she started

269
00:12:59.186 --> 00:13:01.703
feeling herself, being familiar with the technique,

270
00:13:01.703 --> 00:13:05.330
when she'd feel herself being overwhelmed by anxiety,

271
00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.303
she would simply go and do the one where you stand

272
00:13:07.303 --> 00:13:09.010
against the wall, and we're going to show everybody these

273
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:11.228
in a moment. Stand against the wall,

274
00:13:11.228 --> 00:13:14.556
and allow the shaking to go for a little bit.

275
00:13:14.556 --> 00:13:16.946
And then she would find that her anxiety had

276
00:13:16.946 --> 00:13:19.079
completely dissipated. Is this true?

277
00:13:19.079 --> 00:13:20.871
Is this the effect it's having on people?

278
00:13:20.871 --> 00:13:24.503
<v ->Right. Anxiety is nothing but basically we have a baseline</v>

279
00:13:24.503 --> 00:13:27.351
of a certain number of chemicals that we can carry

280
00:13:27.351 --> 00:13:31.159
in our body. Anxiety is we've overproduced that.

281
00:13:31.159 --> 00:13:33.169
Mostly adrenaline is what we're talking about.

282
00:13:33.169 --> 00:13:36.359
And when we do that, organically the body has

283
00:13:36.359 --> 00:13:38.790
a release mechanism that kicks in and helps us

284
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.777
come back down to normal, below our baseline again.

285
00:13:41.777 --> 00:13:43.195
And that's all that's happening.

286
00:13:43.195 --> 00:13:46.267
We're just activating a natural mechanism that's been

287
00:13:46.267 --> 00:13:49.585
in our body since the evolution of the human species.

288
00:13:49.585 --> 00:13:52.402
We just froze the mechanism.

289
00:13:52.402 --> 00:13:55.014
So I'm saying there's a way to actually reactivate

290
00:13:55.014 --> 00:13:57.617
it and restore it back into the person's natural system.

291
00:13:57.617 --> 00:13:59.067
<v Voiceover>So you're saying that we don't naturally</v>

292
00:13:59.067 --> 00:14:02.011
shake enough after trauma. Why is that?

293
00:14:02.011 --> 00:14:06.235
<v ->Well, look at it this way, at once from an animal species.</v>

294
00:14:06.235 --> 00:14:09.008
If you're my boss, and you're angry at me,

295
00:14:09.008 --> 00:14:11.867
and I start to tremor, that's suggesting that

296
00:14:11.867 --> 00:14:15.792
I'm the prey and you're the predator.

297
00:14:15.792 --> 00:14:20.144
Animal systems will demonstrate I can't show you my fear

298
00:14:20.144 --> 00:14:24.752
or my terror because then that will mean you'll win.

299
00:14:24.752 --> 00:14:27.512
Take that same animal behavior and put it into

300
00:14:27.512 --> 00:14:31.224
a socialized setting. If you're my boss and I show weakness,

301
00:14:31.224 --> 00:14:34.242
if I'm standing and I'm getting in an argument with somebody

302
00:14:34.242 --> 00:14:37.144
and I start to tremor or shake, that looks like weakness.

303
00:14:37.144 --> 00:14:38.466
Even my father would say,

304
00:14:38.466 --> 00:14:41.923
Don't shake. Little girls do that. That looks weak.

305
00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:45.175
We're actually trained not to tremor.

306
00:14:45.175 --> 00:14:47.196
Don't show people you're tremoring, even at your wedding.

307
00:14:47.196 --> 00:14:48.537
<v Voiceover>Don't show your cards.</v>

308
00:14:48.537 --> 00:14:49.453
<v ->Don't show your cards.</v>

309
00:14:49.453 --> 00:14:51.884
So what do we do? The minute we start to tremor,

310
00:14:51.884 --> 00:14:55.991
we'll take a drink, as an example, to calm our nerves down.

311
00:14:55.991 --> 00:14:58.556
What we're doing there is actually anesthetizing

312
00:14:58.556 --> 00:15:01.234
the central nervous system so that the tremor mechanism

313
00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:05.720
turns off. We've not only identified it

314
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:10.227
socially as a bad thing, but we've actually

315
00:15:10.227 --> 00:15:12.217
articulated it as a weakness.

316
00:15:12.217 --> 00:15:15.332
Therefore, if you want to be a strong, powerful human being,

317
00:15:15.332 --> 00:15:17.593
don't show that response.

318
00:15:17.593 --> 00:15:20.238
<v Voiceover>So instead, slam down a martini or two.</v>

319
00:15:20.238 --> 00:15:23.097
<v ->Exactly right. But the response is absolutely organically</v>

320
00:15:23.097 --> 00:15:25.944
natural, which we all have experienced in our lives.

321
00:15:25.944 --> 00:15:28.686
There's not one person I've met who hasn't tremored.

322
00:15:28.686 --> 00:15:30.734
It's just that we don't want to admit to it.

323
00:15:30.734 --> 00:15:32.228
<v Voiceover>Right. Right.</v>

324
00:15:32.228 --> 00:15:35.172
I think in just a moment, we'll switch positions

325
00:15:35.172 --> 00:15:37.593
and we have someone that we're going to work with

326
00:15:37.593 --> 00:15:40.462
and you're going to show how this whole thing works,

327
00:15:40.462 --> 00:15:43.235
both the standing up and the lying down positions.

328
00:15:43.235 --> 00:15:43.715
<v ->Right.</v>

329
00:15:43.715 --> 00:15:44.622
<v Voiceover>First of all, how did you come about</v>

330
00:15:44.622 --> 00:15:48.291
understanding that these were the positions that would

331
00:15:48.291 --> 00:15:51.534
induce a sustained ability to shake?

332
00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:53.581
<v ->Well, there were a lot of things, and this was about</v>

333
00:15:53.581 --> 00:15:56.227
a five year process, and it was working on my own body

334
00:15:56.227 --> 00:15:59.800
as well as gracious friends when we were living in war.

335
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.701
But what I began to recognize is that the tremors

336
00:16:02.701 --> 00:16:07.064
came as a result of really tight, contracted muscles.

337
00:16:07.064 --> 00:16:08.728
Because all of us were tight,

338
00:16:08.728 --> 00:16:10.904
and as we tremored, we would relax.

339
00:16:10.904 --> 00:16:13.251
So I just had to figure out, well how do I repeat

340
00:16:13.251 --> 00:16:15.938
the process of contracting and relaxing muscles

341
00:16:15.938 --> 00:16:18.360
over and over, and then which muscle groups

342
00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.849
would I want to do that to?

343
00:16:20.849 --> 00:16:23.528
Primarily, I want to do the flexor muscle groups,

344
00:16:23.528 --> 00:16:26.088
those groups that are going to pull the body forward.

345
00:16:26.088 --> 00:16:29.885
So, I'm going to stress those muscle groups and relax them.

346
00:16:29.885 --> 00:16:33.927
Now, the primary muscle in pulling that pattern in the body

347
00:16:33.927 --> 00:16:36.061
is called the psoas muscle,

348
00:16:36.061 --> 00:16:40.167
and the psoas muscle is located primarily in the pelvis.

349
00:16:40.167 --> 00:16:42.727
It's the only set of muscles that connects the legs

350
00:16:42.727 --> 00:16:45.970
with the pelvis and the lower back, and what that does

351
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.103
is help pull the body forward.

352
00:16:48.103 --> 00:16:50.493
So the psoas muscles are the primary muscles that

353
00:16:50.493 --> 00:16:54.876
I actually want to tighten and relax, and tighten and relax.

354
00:16:54.876 --> 00:16:56.551
<v Voiceover>I know they're really at the heart of a lot</v>

355
00:16:56.551 --> 00:16:59.708
of backaches and pains, chronic pain.

356
00:16:59.708 --> 00:17:02.789
<v ->Precisely. If the psoas muscle is chronically contracted</v>

357
00:17:02.789 --> 00:17:05.477
forward, there are some muscles in the back that will

358
00:17:05.477 --> 00:17:09.573
try to actually pull the body back upright again.

359
00:17:09.573 --> 00:17:12.635
When you have anterior and posterior muscles

360
00:17:12.635 --> 00:17:15.717
both contracting, they're going to compress the spine.

361
00:17:15.717 --> 00:17:18.362
Once you compress the lumbar vertebrae, you're going

362
00:17:18.362 --> 00:17:20.709
to have some neck problems and shoulder problems.

363
00:17:20.709 --> 00:17:24.250
I'm just really working the anatomy of the human structure.

364
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:25.616
<v Voiceover>So have you found a lot of people have had</v>

365
00:17:25.616 --> 00:17:27.226
relief from pain doing this?

366
00:17:27.226 --> 00:17:29.072
<v ->Oh I have a lot of people, depending on what</v>

367
00:17:29.072 --> 00:17:31.418
their back pain is from, will release the back pain

368
00:17:31.418 --> 00:17:32.935
in the first two sessions.

369
00:17:32.935 --> 00:17:33.661
<v Voiceover>Wow.</v>

370
00:17:33.661 --> 00:17:38.502
<v ->A lot of people reduce chronic anxiety in one week.</v>

371
00:17:38.502 --> 00:17:42.519
Only because all we're doing is introducing

372
00:17:42.519 --> 00:17:45.687
an intense relaxation state to the muscles,

373
00:17:45.687 --> 00:17:48.493
and once you do that, then you break the pattern

374
00:17:48.493 --> 00:17:51.138
of the tense traumatic state that they've

375
00:17:51.138 --> 00:17:52.759
been held in for so long.

376
00:17:52.759 --> 00:17:56.285
It's honestly much simpler than we think of.

377
00:17:56.285 --> 00:17:56.876
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

378
00:17:56.876 --> 00:17:59.271
<v ->To do this, and the reason I did it this way,</v>

379
00:17:59.271 --> 00:18:01.287
or the reason I learned how to do it this way,

380
00:18:01.287 --> 00:18:04.828
is I could teach this method once to a whole population

381
00:18:04.828 --> 00:18:08.326
of 200 people, just one time, and they could repeat it,

382
00:18:08.326 --> 00:18:10.546
because it's so simple, all by themselves.

383
00:18:10.546 --> 00:18:11.782
<v Voiceover>Now that's fabulous.</v>

384
00:18:11.782 --> 00:18:14.897
<v ->So we're talking about taking Hurricane Katrina survivors,</v>

385
00:18:14.897 --> 00:18:18.001
as an example, and showing all of them on a video,

386
00:18:18.001 --> 00:18:21.296
and you can work with 10,000 people all one time,

387
00:18:21.296 --> 00:18:24.283
on a TV show, and they can repeat it themselves.

388
00:18:24.283 --> 00:18:26.971
Mothers can do it for their children.

389
00:18:26.971 --> 00:18:30.598
Families can do it as a family practice when they've all

390
00:18:30.598 --> 00:18:32.507
been traumatized in the family.

391
00:18:32.507 --> 00:18:35.850
It releases them from the burden of thinking that

392
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.196
the only way they can heal from trauma is by having

393
00:18:38.196 --> 00:18:40.767
a professional come and show them how to do something.

394
00:18:40.767 --> 00:18:42.303
<v Voiceover>Self-empowerment to the mass.</v>

395
00:18:42.303 --> 00:18:45.109
<v ->Exactly. Exactly. But when we're talking about trauma</v>

396
00:18:45.109 --> 00:18:47.499
on a massive scale on the planet, and we're saying

397
00:18:47.499 --> 00:18:51.092
we need a new paradigm, well the new paradigm is to say

398
00:18:51.092 --> 00:18:54.964
You actually are organically and genetically encoded to know

399
00:18:54.964 --> 00:18:57.618
how to release trauma. I'm just going to restore that

400
00:18:57.618 --> 00:19:00.306
genetic encoding and you can do it yourself.

401
00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:02.397
So that I could take the whole southern Sudan,

402
00:19:02.397 --> 00:19:05.128
which I worked in for three years, and show thousands

403
00:19:05.128 --> 00:19:08.242
of people how to heal themselves from trauma

404
00:19:08.242 --> 00:19:11.047
so they no longer have to rely on me going over

405
00:19:11.047 --> 00:19:12.414
there to do that.

406
00:19:12.414 --> 00:19:14.163
<v Voiceover>Oh, what a service.</v>

407
00:19:14.163 --> 00:19:15.799
So hopefully we'll have tens of thousands of people

408
00:19:15.799 --> 00:19:17.260
watching this interview.

409
00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.242
<v ->Absolutely. Absolutely help.</v>

410
00:19:18.242 --> 00:19:20.332
<v Voiceover>So that it'll serve hopefully as a tutorial,</v>

411
00:19:20.332 --> 00:19:21.260
if you don't mind.

412
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.648
<v ->Absolutely. No. That's the whole purpose of it.</v>

413
00:19:23.648 --> 00:19:26.487
Get it out, en masse, to millions of people,

414
00:19:26.487 --> 00:19:28.962
and get them to start healing themselves from trauma,

415
00:19:28.962 --> 00:19:33.227
and now we've made a cultural shift and a paradigm shift.

416
00:19:36.263 --> 00:19:38.456
<v ->For more information on trauma, please refer to</v>

417
00:19:38.456 --> 00:19:40.941
our interviews with Dr. Robert Scaer, who some would say

418
00:19:40.941 --> 00:19:42.936
has the final word on trauma,

419
00:19:42.936 --> 00:19:45.677
and Lee Gerdes, who is working with both Dr. Scaer

420
00:19:45.677 --> 00:19:48.695
and David Berceli on a very advanced approach

421
00:19:48.695 --> 00:19:51.949
to releasing the effects of trauma from our lives.

422
00:19:51.949 --> 00:19:55.517
Until next time, thanks for watching.
